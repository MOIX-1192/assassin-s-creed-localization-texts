Id: [0x0006E070]
No? Not even a friend who betrayed you as often as he has betrayed us?

Id: [0x0006E098]
Rhona. How are you finding Life among Thieves?

Id: [0x0006E16E]
I remember you. The Templar from Havana.

Id: [0x0006E183]
Captain Thatch, as I live and breath. And what is this magnificent Muzzle you've cultivated?

Id: [0x0006E193]
[Effort sounds]You could have been a Man who stood for something. But you've a Killer's Heart now. With nothing but Mettle to show for all your Blunders.

Id: [0x0006E1A1]
[*famous quote*]I drink Damnation to you and your Men, who are cowardly Puppies! I shall give nor take no Quarter.

Id: [0x0006E1AC]
There you go. Welcome back.

Id: [0x0006E1B0]
A Pain for the Pleasure, Thom. I'm suffering a mild stomach Complaint, going on three Days now.

Id: [0x0006E1BC]
Captain Kenway. You look like a Bowl of Plum Duff.

Id: [0x0006E1C0]
Anne, are you all right?

Id: [0x0006E1C2]
Here's how it goes. Torres meets with Prins carrying a Portion of the Ransom, saying the rest is close behind.

Id: [0x0006E1D8]
Concentrate and focus all your Senses. Look past Shadow and sound, deep into Matter, until you see and hear a kind of Shimmering.

Id: [0x0006E1DA]
[Breathing out with pain]What's happened with Mary? What's wrong?

Id: [0x0006E1DE]
How long has it been since our last Meeting, [SP][señor](Mister) Prins? A Year?

Id: [0x0006E1EC]
That's shite.

Id: [0x0006E1EF]
Guns and Steel answer louder than Sticks and spittle, Vane!

Id: [0x0006E1F6]
Not a bad looking Tinderbox you got there.

Id: [0x0006E20E]
Ach. Bloody Devils.

Id: [0x0006E226]
By God’s Grace, sir, you saved me. A Profusion of Thanks!

Id: [0x0006E239]
You're a natural Sailor, Duncan.

Id: [0x0006E248]
So you were Attacked by Pirates. What a terrible Ordeal. We've seen their number rise rapidly in the past few Years.

Id: [0x0006E249]
What do you make of this Pardon, Edward? Will Nassau survive it?

Id: [0x0006E251]
You Bastard...

Id: [0x0006E25D]
Our Helmsman's dead! Someone take the Wheel!

Id: [0x0006E273]
They're a miserable and randy Lot, as all Men at Sea.

Id: [0x0006E288]
Can we take you somewhere, Sir?

Id: [0x0006E289]
They're no Danger to us. Slavers aren't well armed.

Id: [0x0006E28E]
This is but a Portion of the Ransom. The rest is close at Hand.

Id: [0x0006E28F]
Drop anchor!

Id: [0x0006E292]
Ah, there's a Tug of the Wind at my Hair! I find a bracing Comfort in the Feel and Smell of the Ocean. The raw Stink of... of Possibility!

Id: [0x0006E2A5]
Hey![A beat] I just saw you were logging out. I thought I'd stop by to give you something.

Id: [0x0006E2AC]
I've more than enough of all that!

Id: [0x0006E2AF]
[Panting]I'm turning inside out!

Id: [0x0006E2B9]
Welcome aboard, Duncan. She's a modest Schooner but well-suited to my Purpose. Trafficking Cargo from my Plantation and such.

Id: [0x0006E2BD]
Sail Ho, Captain! Two more slave Ships.

Id: [0x0006E2BE]
You saw the men that waylaid me? You saw them that took my ship?

Id: [0x0006E2C6]
Ask yourself, Edward: Who destroyed the medicine stocks before we arrived? Who relieved the Nassau's watch as we sailed into port? Who spiked the cannons that might have beaten us back?

Id: [0x0006E2CE]
I'm no Templar, Mate! That were just a Ruse! We've come here to Save your Arse from this Slaver.

Id: [0x0006E2F0]
I'm seeing the Devil you promised, Thatch.

Id: [0x0006E2F5]
A damn Sight better than you have, Ben. The Heart of a Traitor, who thinks himself better than his Mates!

Id: [0x0006E2F8]
You're on the patrilineal line, yeah?

Id: [0x0006E2FF]
In honest Service there are thin Commons, low Wages, and hard Labour. Yet as Gentlemen of Fortune we enjoy Plenty and Satisfaction, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power... so what Man with a sensible Mind would choose the former Life, when the only Hazard we Pirates run is a sour Look from those without Strength or Splendour!

Id: [0x0006E300]
Of course we will. These men cherish the Freedom that Nassau affords. Accepting the King's Pardon would be a simple Surrender, nothing more.

Id: [0x0006E302]
Aye, Since the Treaty of Utrecht. Too many British Sailors out of work, looking to make a living any way they can.

Id: [0x0006E307]
Captain Kenway...

Id: [0x0006E309]
Why hang over me like a leering Crow? To see an Old Man suffer?

Id: [0x0006E30A]
Hm. Let's have a Touch, shall we?

Id: [0x0006E30D]
[heavy breath]I'm not a Man accustomed to Murder, Captain. And if you'd taken Quarter, you'd not be seeping now.

Id: [0x0006E326]
Devil damn the Man, he was fierce. But his Heart was divided.

Id: [0x0006E335]
...we do hereby promise and declare that in Case any of the said Pirates shall on, or before, the 5th of September, in the Year of our Lord 1718, surrender him or themselves to any one of the Principle Secretaries of State in Great Britain or Ireland, or to any Governor or Deputy Governor of any of our Plantations beyond the Seas...

Id: [0x0006E343]
Sod a Year. I'm looking for a Prize that'll set me up for Life. I'll be King of the West Indies then.

Id: [0x0006E34C]
Good! Take us in close.

Id: [0x0006E350]
For until such time all of you will be confined in Nassau.[A beat] I am sorry for this, but in lieu of a public Trial, this Pardon is your best Bet.

Id: [0x0006E352]
Nearer Eighteen months. You first described this Roberts Fellow to me in November of 1715.

Id: [0x0006E356]
I did a decent Trick at the Helm some time ago. Two Years before the Mast as a Privateer.

Id: [0x0006E359]
No Preshah, eh Kenway? The Obeah (black magic) comes natural to us.

Id: [0x0006E35E]
Nature can be diverted, but never subdued.

Id: [0x0006E36A]
[SP][La cena. Cómetela rápido.](Supper. Eat it fast.)

Id: [0x0006E36C]
Gentleman! As is Custom among our Kind, we do not plunge headlong into Folly on the Orders of a single Madman, but act according to our own collective Madness!

Id: [0x0006E37C]
[SP][¡Perro inglés!](English Dog!)

Id: [0x0006E380]
It's nothing fierce, mind; more of a dull Throb.

Id: [0x0006E383]
Yes, yes, it's a shame. There is always some cause behind even the worst Habits. Still, we should not forgive Men for their Evil simply because we understand their impetus towards it.

Id: [0x0006E388]
Your old mate, Ben Hornigold. On the orders of Governor Rogers himself.

Id: [0x0006E38D]
We ain't out of this yet.

Id: [0x0006E394]
Here's a Health to the King and a lasting Peace / To Faction an End, to Wealth increase; / Come, let us drink it while we have Breath, / For there's no drinking after Death, / And he that will this Health deny, Down among the Dead men, / Down among the dead Men, / Down, down, down, down, /Down among the dead Men let him lie.

Id: [0x0006E39C]
We've settled on a new Course. None must find the Observatory, so the Templars now seeking it must die.

Id: [0x0006E3A1]
I find your Bearing appalling, Prins. I believe all thinking, feeling Men deserve Respect and Opportunity.

Id: [0x0006E3A5]
You put me on a Spot, Adé. After you leaving me with Roberts, I should have hard Feelings about seeing you here.[He softens] But mostly, I'm bloody glad.

Id: [0x0006E3AD]
You refuse to return me to my ship, is that right?

Id: [0x0006E3AF]
[FR][Salut!](Hello!) Hi, thanks for coming in. I know you're busy.

Id: [0x0006E3B1]
Aye, the triple-mast sailing nor-nor-west.

Id: [0x0006E3BC]
We must reach the ships. But this woman cannot run.

Id: [0x0006E3BD]
[Laboured breathing and Agonized scream]

Id: [0x0006E3BE]
[SP][Ah, sí.](Ah yes.) Much has changed in that short Time, you know. None call me Governor, for instance, for I quit that Post last Year.

Id: [0x0006E3C3]
It's the Whydah!

Id: [0x0006E3CA]
Aye, and proven true! What have you done since Nassau fell? Nothing but Murder and Mayhem!

Id: [0x0006E3CE]
You've caused no small Portion of Suffering yourself, Mr. Prins. Retribution, I suppose.

Id: [0x0006E3D8]
Will I swim ashore? Come on man!

Id: [0x0006E3D9]
Quaint finding you here. It's only six bloody Months since the Deal we made.

Id: [0x0006E3DC]
Putting some Shape to your Sentiments?

Id: [0x0006E3EA]
But not every Man is as bold as we are. Many are miserable and hungry... barely holding on.

Id: [0x0006E3EC]
But don't I remember Talk of Trinity College? And Rome? And Montpellier?

Id: [0x0006E3EF]
Still, we're better paid than them in the Navy. That seems to keep the Boys tame.

Id: [0x0006E3F3]
Just find the Captain!

Id: [0x0006E3FE]
What you feel is the light of Life. Of living Things Past and Present. The Residue of Vitality, come and gone.

Id: [0x0006E403]
[FR][Fils de Putain!](You Son of a Whore!)[Laughs weakly] As bold as a Musket Ball, and still half as sharp.

Id: [0x0006E409]
Argh... I'd have shown 'em my Angel if they'd taken Quarter.

Id: [0x0006E40C]
That's a top Way of seeing it, Mate.

Id: [0x0006E40D]
[coughing and sputtering]

Id: [0x0006E40E]
So this is the new Libertalia, eh?[takes a deep breath] Stinks the same as every other Squat I've robbed this past Year.

Id: [0x0006E419]
Yeah, I'm researching Flavia Autidore for the next few days. Then I'm onto her son.

Id: [0x0006E421]
Well! That's some soft Talk coming from a Pirate. And as it happens... I mostly agree.

Id: [0x0006E428]
[*famous quote*]We’ve knocked them on the Heads except three or four. Let's jump aboard and cut 'em to Pieces!

Id: [0x0006E429]
It's the Practice that Kills me, Man. Selling Men and Women like Chattel. I can't bloody stand it. It's an abomination.

Id: [0x0006E42B]
Mister Hands, will you call us out?

Id: [0x0006E43B]
She'll do fine.

Id: [0x0006E43C]
Ah... the Templars have been busy I see.

Id: [0x0006E43F]
Every such Pirate and Pirates so surrendering him, or themselves, as aforesaid, shall have our gracious Pardon, of and for such, his or their Piracy, or Piracies, by him or them committed before the fifth of January next ensuing.

Id: [0x0006E44C]
Devil in his Hole, Thatch! This is a darling Galley. Thirty-two Guns, is it?

Id: [0x0006E44D]
It's hard to let go of the Life you know best.

Id: [0x0006E44E]
Suck a Muzzle, Gobshite. You'll be hanged and Sun-dried, just as them that were in Boston.

Id: [0x0006E456]
But she's bearing North-West. Nowhere near Jamaica.

Id: [0x0006E459]
One's slipped her Cable and set off ... the Whydah.

Id: [0x0006E45A]
Is she gone?

Id: [0x0006E460]
We'll see her there safely. Start walking.

Id: [0x0006E466]
He's returned, Captain!

Id: [0x0006E469]
I'll pay a lump sum of ten-thousand Reales if you take her back for me.

Id: [0x0006E473]
Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x0006E47B]
It can. But if you have any trouble-

Id: [0x0006E47C]
Just a short Letter home.[Long pause] I reckon she's past caring anyway.

Id: [0x0006E48F]
Are you not loved at Home? Are you not wanted by your Wives and Families and Countrymen?

Id: [0x0006E491]
We'll save the clashing of Cutlasses for the Military, and them that get in our way.

Id: [0x0006E493]
Jaysus, Edward. Living like this is like living with large a Hole in your Gut, and every goddamn Time your Innards spill over the Ground, you're obliged to scoop 'em up and shove 'em back in!

Id: [0x0006E497]
She's cracked, Lads!

Id: [0x0006E49A]
Easy, Boy. You'll be all right.

Id: [0x0006E4A0]
You have confused my Dreams with my Deeds. I have spoken of my Wish to study in these Places, but a lack of Money and a Paucity of Connections has prevented it.

Id: [0x0006E4A1]
Is that yours?

Id: [0x0006E4AF]
Bloody fucking Pirates!

Id: [0x0006E4B5]
You absurd Cutthroats and your precious Philosophy. You live in the World, but you cannot make it move.

Id: [0x0006E4B9]
True. And yet, three Years ago he sent Men to capture and kill everyone here. Now he's coddling us. It's a Retreat.

Id: [0x0006E4BB]
Now, I have been among you six Weeks, and in that Time I have adopted your Outlook as my own, and with so fierce a Conviction that it may Frighten you to see your Passions reflected from me in so Stark a Light. But... if it's a Captain you see in me now, aye then... I'll be your bloody Captain!

Id: [0x0006E4BE]
I lost count at Forty.

Id: [0x0006E4C3]
[SP][Que tengo un buen día senor!](Good day to you sir!) I am Captain Hornigold and this is my Crew. We're Sailors like yourselves, but quite unalike in our Purpose.

Id: [0x0006E4C8]
Yet another dire Situation, Roberts. We really must stop meeting like this.

Id: [0x0006E4CA]
Heyo, Bonnet. Flying your own Flag at last!

Id: [0x0006E4D2]
I see.[TONE presses on Edward's abdomen] Does this hurt?

Id: [0x0006E4D6]
Sod off.

Id: [0x0006E4DD]
Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x0006E4DE]
Days? I'm doing one ancestor every two months.

Id: [0x0006E4E1]
Ah... all Men desire to live by a Code, or a Creed, yes? Yet when pressed, most defer to their Instincts rather than the Laws that bind them. But what is the Appeal of a Creed if it does not yoke all Men to like Behavior?

Id: [0x0006E4E6]
Save me? I work for Mister Prins.

Id: [0x0006E4F0]
Here's to our Pirate Republic, Lads. We're prosperous and free, and out of the Reach of Kings, Clergy, and Debt Collectors.

Id: [0x0006E4F1]
What the Hell's happened here? Were you attacked?

Id: [0x0006E4F7]
Why fly a black Flag when a black Beard will do? What brings you two gents this far North?

Id: [0x0006E4F9]
If you are so inclined you may Steer her yourself. My Helmsman and Quartermaster were among those killed.

Id: [0x0006E500]
Morning, Adé. Tail-end of the dog Watch?

Id: [0x0006E501]
And we do hereby strictly charge and command all our Admirals, Captains, and other Officers at Sea... and all our Governors, and Commanders of any Forts, Castles, or other Places in our Plantations, and all our Officers Civil and Military, to seize and take such of the Pirates, who shall refuse or neglect to surrender themselves accordingly.

Id: [0x0006E505]
Can't be done.

Id: [0x0006E506]
Well, we ain't attacking them on account of your Conscience.

Id: [0x0006E50A]
Thatch is overwhelmed. I'm going Ashore.

Id: [0x0006E50D]
When you murder a man at Sea and cast his Body out with the Flotsam, how can we know he's truly dead?

Id: [0x0006E510]
My Curiosity outstrips theirs. Am I on your List too?

Id: [0x0006E515]
It may be. But now the World has one less Snake in it.[Beat] And that's enough for me.

Id: [0x0006E548]
A mighty Mess there.

Id: [0x0006E55C]
If you see Prins before I do, kill him and there'll be a bit of Coin in it for you. All right?

Id: [0x0006E560]
Ah. What’s this?

Id: [0x0006E561]
Other Way 'round. It were Blackbeard who struck first. Opened Fire on a British Man O' War, the Pillock!

Id: [0x0006E56A]
Trust me.

Id: [0x0006E56F]
It's no Good.[Laboured breathing]

Id: [0x0006E576]
I'm not asking you to. I'm only speaking my mind.

Id: [0x0006E578]
No, Kenway. You run this Scheme alone, at the Risk of losing the Faith of your Crew. It makes me ill to think of you bartering with that wretched Slaver.

Id: [0x0006E57D]
Well, this is a rush job. They want to know where this line crosses with the Kenways. What are you on, the maternal line?

Id: [0x0006E57F]
[clears his throat]

Id: [0x0006E58B]
Mmm, nah.

Id: [0x0006E590]
You've stepped up a Rung. So... Any Luck finding Medicines here?

Id: [0x0006E594]
First-Rate approaching! Ninety guns or more!

Id: [0x0006E595]
Yes... Yes, Blackbeard cut me loose sadly. Time to have a Go at this myself.

Id: [0x0006E5A6]
If I have any trouble, I'll handle it or I'll walk away. But calling on my Captain for Mediation is NOT the surest Way to find Respect among this Lot.

Id: [0x0006E5A9]
Yes, Sir. The Sand says about half an Hour.

Id: [0x0006E5AA]
It is my Vessel, yes. But, ah... here lies its poor Captain. And I have no Art for Sailing.

Id: [0x0006E5AB]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0006E5AE]
Was I drunk when you told me?

Id: [0x0006E5B0]
Look on this as a Stroke of Fortune, Lads. We should take the Kings Pardon, and salvage what Dignity we own.

Id: [0x0006E5B1]
All Topmen aloft!

Id: [0x0006E5B5]
The Commodore's gone ahead to Kingston. We're to commandeer this Lubber's Ship and Follow.

Id: [0x0006E5BE]
The King's called for a Pardon!

Id: [0x0006E5CA]
Oy! Why the long Face? You falling in Love?

Id: [0x0006E5D0]
Oh Charles! What a surly Devil you are!

Id: [0x0006E5D7]
How else to explain your Government's complete Disinterest in your Well-Being? Hostages for Medicines, these were my only Terms!

Id: [0x0006E5DA]
The Object of our Attention is a square-rigged Galleon, and we want her for the Advantage she'll bring Nassau. So I'll put it to the vote...

Id: [0x0006E5DC]
This Billy-Huff didn't last two Months with your Ship before he came limping back to Nassau. Took the Pardon straight away.

Id: [0x0006E5DD]
Do you have any postage stamps?

Id: [0x0006E5DF]
That Schooner is taking its Leave at last.

Id: [0x0006E5E3]
[Laughing]Me too, Breddah. And you'll be chuffed to know, your Jackdaw is still in one Piece.

Id: [0x0006E5E4]
I hope for your Sake you are a luckier Man than dear Captain Kidd.

Id: [0x0006E5E5]
Yeah, an Arab called Sef. Thirteenth century.

Id: [0x0006E5E9]
Oh, Piss! I'll be hanged before I surrender to that Bobbin.

Id: [0x0006E5F2]
Aw. You're a hard Heart that should be softer.

Id: [0x0006E5F6]
You mean Libertalia? The Pirate Town?

Id: [0x0006E606]
Where's your Helmsman, Kenway?

Id: [0x0006E609]
We'll take him below!

Id: [0x0006E60E]
Come on, Lads! If we're to drown today, it won't be here!

Id: [0x0006E615]
Bastard. That Ship belongs to Laurens Prins, a Dutch Slaver.

Id: [0x0006E618]
Find the Captain and END this.

Id: [0x0006E61A]
Don’t fuck with me, Jack.

Id: [0x0006E622]
If it is Money you need, you have chosen the right Profession to Gain some, no?

Id: [0x0006E62A]
Aye. My own idiot Father liked to brag about how he meant to purchase a Ship of his own.[Takes on a nasally voice] I'll get a privateering Contract, Charlie. Your old Dad will be a Captain.

Id: [0x0006E630]
I do. Just a moment.

Id: [0x0006E633]
I can pilot her myself. No mind.

Id: [0x0006E648]
Has a good Feel. We'll first strike to Half-Sail to get ourselves moving.

Id: [0x0006E64D]
Understood.

Id: [0x0006E64E]
And yet, six Days of pure fucking Silence![a pause] So I must conclude that you Men are the Pariahs of Charles-Towne, and I would profit better by using your Organs for Chum and your Bones for Char!

Id: [0x0006E655]
I am told your Surname is Roberts. Is this so?

Id: [0x0006E656]
Well, that's grand!

Id: [0x0006E659]
Ah...[small laugh] Lively Havana! I've been here once before. It was a truly awe-ful Pleasure.

Id: [0x0006E65D]
Nothing 'round this Spot, sadly. But there's a few Wrecks yonder that haven't been scoured by nothing but Crabs and Coral.

Id: [0x0006E662]
Christ, I've got a Head for ten.[Beat][Effort sound]

Id: [0x0006E663]
A quick Proposal. You take me to the Sage, and you'll not be hurt.

Id: [0x0006E667]
If you kill your old Friend, and bring proof of the deed to me in Nassau, the King will reward you amply. A full Pardon, a minor peerage in England, and thirty acres of your own land, at 2,500 pounds a year.

Id: [0x0006E670]
The Charges, Sir. I’ll hear them again.

Id: [0x0006E67B]
I ain't leaving you, dammit! Lift your Arm!

Id: [0x0006E67D]
Kingston, then. Quickly as you can.

Id: [0x0006E680]
By the Devil.

Id: [0x0006E68B]
Woodes Rogers. Ben Hornigold. Even Torres himself. Small Quantities, kept for a special Purpose.

Id: [0x0006E68E]
Well then he's a poor Man to call Master. He meant to sell you out to the Templars.

Id: [0x0006E68F]
Stop tailing me and your Wish'd come true.

Id: [0x0006E691]
I must say, I am quite taken by this new Vocation of mine. And it may amuse you to know that I have authored my own Articles of Conduct.

Id: [0x0006E697]
We'd work WITH you, Edward. Pay you even. As much Gold as we can spare.

Id: [0x0006E69C]
Any unpleasant Evacuations of late?

Id: [0x0006E6AF]
Aye. Pity about Nassau. And Blackbeard flying the Coop.

Id: [0x0006E6BF]
Captain ... is it true you was engaged to a Duchess back in England?

Id: [0x0006E6C1]
If I help you kill these men.

Id: [0x0006E6C8]
I'm a wanted Man too, Commodore. Why shed these blessings on me?

Id: [0x0006E6CA]
Ah, Man... you flatter me with your Persistence.

Id: [0x0006E6D3]
Drown in a Whiskey Bottle before he ever left Shore.

Id: [0x0006E6D4]
But It's my mandate to fuck with you, Charles.[He Snaps] Lads!

Id: [0x0006E6DD]
[Laboured breathing]Stop! Stop. Please.

Id: [0x0006E6E5]
We do.

Id: [0x0006E6EC]
[Nods]Milord.[He stands] His Majesty's Court contends that the Defendants, Mary Read and Anne Bonny, did piratically, feloniously, and in an hostile Manner, attack, engage, and take seven certain fishing Boats...

Id: [0x0006E6F6]
A very generous Retreat.

Id: [0x0006E705]
Yes, it's for the Best, I think. I should have some wild Stories when next we meet.

Id: [0x0006E708]
How do you mean?

Id: [0x0006E710]
By God, yes. Thom, We'll send you back to Dublin with a Chest of Reales in no Time.

Id: [0x0006E714]
Topmen, lay aloft!

Id: [0x0006E71D]
[Gurgling laugh]

Id: [0x0006E71E]
A Pirate TOWN? [laughs]Good God. To call Libertalia a Town, one must call Havana the whole of the World.

Id: [0x0006E721]
Could we talk a moment about the Condition of the Gundeck?

Id: [0x0006E725]
All those in favor of storming this Cove and taking this Ship, stomp and shout "Aye!"

Id: [0x0006E72C]
You got a name?

Id: [0x0006E734]
Powerful guns and heavy Hull. Looks to be poor Odds.

Id: [0x0006E738]
S-sorry, Kingston?[small laugh] No, no... our Destination is Havana. I'm just a Merchant-

Id: [0x0006E744]
Did that greasy Spaniard put you up to this? Are you one of his medieval Cultists?

Id: [0x0006E74A]
I’ll cut you another Cunt, Traitor!

Id: [0x0006E754]
It pains me to Traffick a Man of my own Race for Profit, Mister Torres. Tell me again... what has this Roberts fellow done to upset you?

Id: [0x0006E756]
Old fella?

Id: [0x0006E75E]
I'm grateful for the Confidence, Gents, but sure, it's not as easy as strutting back into Town with a Box of Gold in my Arms and slamming it down on the Dean's Desk and telling him, Here's Thomas Patrick Tone ready to take his Degree, Sir. There'll be Questions and Queries, and men asking after my curious Absence these past five Years.

Id: [0x0006E768]
Aye!

Id: [0x0006E76D]
I am my own Man, and this no Game.

Id: [0x0006E76F]
Convened at last. And in such continental Company... England, France, Spain... Citizens of sad and corrupted Empires.

Id: [0x0006E770]
Expulsions of malodorous Substances; Bile, Diarrhea, Blood from one Fundament or the other?

Id: [0x0006E772]
Aye. Rogers, Torres, Chamberlaine ... and Benjamin Hornigold.

Id: [0x0006E77D]
Because very few men know your real name, Mr. Kenway. And your return to England would not upset many.

Id: [0x0006E77F]
You must take me to the Observatory, Roberts. I need to know what it is.

Id: [0x0006E780]
The Whydah's been taken. Black Sam Bellamy by the look of it.

Id: [0x0006E78B]
Every Man and Woman on this Earth has in them a kind of Intuition hidden deep away.

Id: [0x0006E78F]
Who needs to know?

Id: [0x0006E795]
Damn, you man! Turn this tub around!

Id: [0x0006E798]
I'll have a Look.

Id: [0x0006E79A]
Aye. But in any case, I can't see any our of Men accepting it.

Id: [0x0006E7A5]
Mmph!

Id: [0x0006E7A6]
By Christ![a beat] This is my Predicament: to kill ya, or to Press you into my Service.[a beat] It's a Decision I'll make hardly, but not with Remorse.

Id: [0x0006E7AD]
What's the trouble?

Id: [0x0006E7B3]
You don't mean to abscond with my Ship, do you?

Id: [0x0006E7C8]
Ha ha ha! Burn you Bastards!

Id: [0x0006E7D1]
For we intend to take all that you own. Yet no Harm shall befall any Man, so long as he remains at Ease. Is that clear?

Id: [0x0006E7D7]
So what now? Still chasing your elusive Fortune?

Id: [0x0006E7E1]
Hornigold offered me an Estate in England. A Title too, if only I'd join the Templars.

Id: [0x0006E7E2]
Can't do it, codger. We're outclassed.

Id: [0x0006E7EB]
Look at me, Son. A Bullet would only improve this Face, clear my Mind, and bring a fitting End to a long and hearty Career. So top me if you must. But don’t expect me to beg for Mercy. I’m not made for it.

Id: [0x0006E7F1]
The logs. For Posterity.

Id: [0x0006E7F3]
In a World without Gold, we might have been <br>Heroes!

Id: [0x0006E7FA]
Dash my Buttons! Your Life seems a grand One, if I may say. So full of Adventure! How marvelous.

Id: [0x0006E7FD]
You ask me what I know of the Jackdaw's Captain, and can he promise you an easy life of Plunder, Prizes, and Leisure...?

Id: [0x0006E801]
I take Pride in Piloting my own Ships, Ben. Keeps me alert.

Id: [0x0006E804]
The Magazine!

Id: [0x0006E805]
You're not so famous as that, are you?

Id: [0x0006E807]
If Prins ain't with the Pirates, he'll be floating with the Fish. Let's get in close.

Id: [0x0006E808]
[Long laugh]Naughty naughty, Mister Walpole.

Id: [0x0006E810]
Is this some Form of protestant Piety I am not familiar with?

Id: [0x0006E814]
Might make a Man feel like... he belongs to something.[beat] What's your Answer?

Id: [0x0006E817]
A Creed of your own, eh?

Id: [0x0006E818]
What isn't, Captain? It's a pitiful sight.

Id: [0x0006E81A]
We can't outrun her, Thatch.

Id: [0x0006E81D]
Ah, well, in a Way. My Bowels HAVE been rather Spry.

Id: [0x0006E824]
Charles Vane, slinking off with his Tail between his legs. That's good News for us.

Id: [0x0006E82B]
Aye. Must be his 70s now.

Id: [0x0006E832]
Engaged?[long beat] Well, if by that you mean nuptially committed, Forever and Anon, then no, Lad I was not. But if by engaged you mean an “AFFAIR embarked upon”, or an “undertaking ENTERED into,” then indeed I was, as I have been a hundred other Times, with a hundred other lovely Ladies between Kingston and Cape Cod.

Id: [0x0006E834]
Think on it, Edward. I'll be in Nassau, awaiting your answer.

Id: [0x0006E83D]
Edward... your constant Friendship has been my most treasured Find on these Seas. Well above Gold and Silver and Rum, I ... I prize the Courage you have inspired in me this Year. Thank You, Sir! A fair good Morrow to you!

Id: [0x0006E843]
Christ. Why Ben...?

Id: [0x0006E846]
But we've all got a Hunger and Passion for the Life we lead here. Once Men taste the Freedom found in our Republic, they'll want no other Flavour.

Id: [0x0006E849]
Fancy meeting a Welshman deep in Dago Country. I'm English meself. Biding my time 'til the next War calls me to Service.

Id: [0x0006E84A]
Those who oppose... whimper "Nay."

Id: [0x0006E852]
Aye. And I'm close. I've heard the Sage is sailing out of Kingston on a Ship called the Princess.

Id: [0x0006E854]
No, what I saw in Madagascar was little more than the Aftermath of a sad Orgy. Not a Pirate Town, but a ruffian's Squat. Even the feral Dogs seemed ashamed of its Condition.

Id: [0x0006E866]
Oh, we'll see about Thatch.[Effort sounds while standing up] Vane's off to see him now, and I'm following soon.

Id: [0x0006E86A]
Edward!

Id: [0x0006E86F]
The Templars that tripped this Ambush are Camped in the Village. Deal with them.

Id: [0x0006E87B]
What's the Take?

Id: [0x0006E87D]
This is what's left of your Experiment in Democracy?

Id: [0x0006E880]
Captain... we've searched the Hold. It's a middling Take, but the Medicine we found bears a "Charles-Towne" Stamp.

Id: [0x0006E883]
Ahoy, Edward.

Id: [0x0006E885]
To keep the Peace, Yes. I forbid all Gambling upon the Deck, for instance, for it leads to more Conflict than Camaraderie. Desertion during Battle is forbidden. And I require that all Men keep their Pieces and Cutlasses clean and fit for Service at all times...

Id: [0x0006E88D]
The Governor puts it far too brightly, Maggots. Take this message Home: accept the King's Protection forthwith, or we will raze this Town to its Foundation and stretch your bloody Necks.

Id: [0x0006E88E]
Dublin's a small Place. Even if they don't know your Face there, they've still dated your sister.

Id: [0x0006E88F]
As for the twenty or thirty Men living there, I cannot say they were ragged, since most wore no Clothes at all. They had gone native, as the Saying goes.

Id: [0x0006E891]
Loose the Sails!

Id: [0x0006E893]
And how is it you're so keen for his hard Parts, Mr. Rackham?

Id: [0x0006E89F]
You're a good Man, Edward. And if you learn to keep settled in one Place for more than a week, you'll make a fine Father too.

Id: [0x0006E8A3]
Laurens Prins. I reckon you have heard of me.

Id: [0x0006E8A9]
As for you, Mr. Walpole...

Id: [0x0006E8AD]
[Cheerings.]

Id: [0x0006E8AE]
He's a Templar now. Sworn to the same Oaths. Driven by the same Contempt for Liberty.

Id: [0x0006E8C0]
Dead and buried. After he tried to kill me.

Id: [0x0006E8C2]
Hold fast!

Id: [0x0006E8C4]
I have seen my Share of Strangeness, aye.

Id: [0x0006E8C8]
I'm Duncan. What’s your name, Friend?

Id: [0x0006E8D5]
Lucky King George having a Piss-pot like you flying his Flag.

Id: [0x0006E8D8]
We can't fight fair, neither. Just follow my Orders.[small breaths]

Id: [0x0006E8DC]
But nothing apart from This?

Id: [0x0006E8DF]
Something wrong, Duncan?

Id: [0x0006E8F4]
Never was the King's Council so unified.

Id: [0x0006E8F6]
But you are Templars now. The secret and true Legislators of the World.[Beat] Please, hold out your Hands.

Id: [0x0006E8F8]
To what End, eh? Will you sell it from under my Nose? Or work with me and use it to bolster our Gains?

Id: [0x0006E8FC]
Sensible.

Id: [0x0006E8FE]
No.

Id: [0x0006E902]
Shots fired ashore!

Id: [0x0006E905]
And pray that my occasional weakness for port wine doesn't loose my lips enough to whisper the name Kenway to anyone who thinks less of you....

Id: [0x0006E907]
We are not sorry to see him gone. But it was you who carried out his final Betrayal. Why?

Id: [0x0006E909]
Give me a chance to Sway him. If I can't, he'll die as quick as any Man.

Id: [0x0006E919]
See, for all our Cursing of the Marines, they do us one better for Discipline. A Gundeck should be orderly, and as clean as whale's Arse.

Id: [0x0006E91B]
Edward? Edward, is that you? My Goodness, the West Indies is a compact Place!

Id: [0x0006E91C]
Oy! Skulk! I seen your Face before. You's Mates with them Pirates down in Nassau.

Id: [0x0006E924]
She’s on us!

Id: [0x0006E92A]
Are two okay?

Id: [0x0006E92C]
The Pardon up your ARSE, Governor!

Id: [0x0006E92E]
Stede. Stede Bonnet.

Id: [0x0006E92F]
Douse the Flames!

Id: [0x0006E932]
Sir, I had nothing to do with this Attack. My Crew and I had merely anchored to water and resupply!

Id: [0x0006E935]
Better infamous than forgotten, wouldn't you say?

Id: [0x0006E937]
[SP][¡No me mate, señor! Tengo familia. ¡Se lo suplico!](Don't kill me, Sir! I have a Family. Please!)

Id: [0x0006E93C]
Right, Kenway... I been musing on this Plan of yours. This... Observatory you're always going on about. How do we know it exists?

Id: [0x0006E93F]
You'd like to know my Secrets, would you?

Id: [0x0006E946]
What the Hell are you doing, man? All of Charles-Towne can see this Mess.

Id: [0x0006E94A]
Two Crates, and the Means for mixing additional Doses.

Id: [0x0006E955]
Put your Ambition to better use, Kenway. Find the Sage with US.

Id: [0x0006E959]
Didn't appeal to you?

Id: [0x0006E95B]
Oh, indeed. For of all the Gentlemen of Fortune that sail these West-Indies, he ranks amongst the Canniest...

Id: [0x0006E95D]
You're such a Pain in the Arse. Damn it, you should have been the One to outlast me.

Id: [0x0006E95F]
Secondly, this Court contends that the Defendants lurked upon the high Seas and did set upon, shoot at, and take, two certain Merchant Sloops, thus putting the Captains and their Crews in corporeal Fear of their Lives.

Id: [0x0006E96C]
Might have. Would I be wrong by guessing you were in the Slave trade? Your ship looked like a transport.

Id: [0x0006E970]
Dear Lady, what do they call you?

Id: [0x0006E973]
Well Mister Bonnet, let this stay ‘twixt us... but I am on a secret Errand for His Majesty the King, God save him, and I must get to Havana with Speed.

Id: [0x0006E976]
No. It's Nothing. Sand in my Hampers.

Id: [0x0006E978]
Those Sailors were quite animated by the Idea of Pirates roaming these Waters. Is it a real Danger, do you suppose?

Id: [0x0006E981]
It did. But I'd sooner stay out of this war of yours.

Id: [0x0006E986]
And punishable by Death if disobeyed.

Id: [0x0006E98C]
[Sigh]Aye, we do as we please here. And take our Time doing it.

Id: [0x0006E992]
Excellent.

Id: [0x0006E994]
[To receptionist]Oui, merci.[Then to his friend] But it's a good work out!

Id: [0x0006E997]
I've done my Part. Will you?

Id: [0x0006E999]
You see? You tipped your Hand too early. You get Nothing.

Id: [0x0006E99A]
Check your head, Vane! We had here a rare Opportunity; a Chance to take Something base and shape it into a Government, made and maintained by Men of Vision. But in two Years we pissed it away. I won't make that Mistake again.

Id: [0x0006E99E]
Men crave a commanding voice, he once told me.

Id: [0x0006E99F]
Loose Sails!

Id: [0x0006E9A3]
It was... made more than two dozen trips between here and the African coast. Bloody hell.

Id: [0x0006E9AE]
If I believed that, I'd sooner be a Butcher than a Surgeon.

Id: [0x0006E9B1]
Your file says you've done some Memory Research before, but not to this extent, which is surprising. You're very good. The data-streams are very stable.

Id: [0x0006E9B6]
But look here, a clutter of linstocks, heaped like tinder [she picks one up; the fuse at its end is smoking] and one with a slow match still burning. How's that?

Id: [0x0006E9BB]
Oh aye. Give me a small Hint, like. Or a large One, if you're an upright Gentlemen.

Id: [0x0006E9BD]
It's the Idea.[a beat] Out of Range but well in Sight.

Id: [0x0006E9BE]
We find a Slave Ship called the Princess. Aboard should be a Man called Roberts. He can lead us to it.

Id: [0x0006E9BF]
Thank you, Mr. Hands.

Id: [0x0006E9C3]
Ah... That's right Thinking. Precious little of that these Days.

Id: [0x0006E9C4]
No ... No, it's plain what's going on here. You're Pirates, just as them that took my Whydah.

Id: [0x0006E9C6]
[crowd laughs]

Id: [0x0006E9CC]
Will you pull the trigger yourself?

Id: [0x0006E9D0]
Money was my only Aim.

Id: [0x0006E9E5]
You're welcome to Nassau, Gents. Everyone is that does their fair Share.

Id: [0x0006E9F0]
'Allo, Bonnet. A Surprise seeing you out here.

Id: [0x0006E9F2]
Anne, when they're sober. A Jilt when they're sauced. But never Lady.

Id: [0x0006E9F3]
Slavers ashore! It's a Massacre.

Id: [0x0006E9FB]
Is it?

Id: [0x0006E9FF]
A Possibility. But most Pirates stalk the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola.

Id: [0x0006EA11]
Ladies and Gentlemen, a Toast to my brief Tenure as Governor of the Bahamas! For, under my Watch, no less than three-hundred avowed Pirates took the King's Pardon and swore Fealty to the Crown!

Id: [0x0006EA13]
A lucrative trade, I hear.

Id: [0x0006EA15]
Fair point.

Id: [0x0006EA17]
For Christ's Sake, Edward. Don't anything but the Stink of Riches wrinkle your Nose?

Id: [0x0006EA1C]
So where's the Medicine?

Id: [0x0006EA1E]
Open your Hand.

Id: [0x0006EA1F]
What was it this time, Edward?

Id: [0x0006EA23]
I've been called worse.

Id: [0x0006EA24]
Fantastic work! Very promising.

Id: [0x0006EA2A]
All them Slavers work for the Royal African Company.[beat] Let's find one of their Ships and start asking some Questions.

Id: [0x0006EA2B]
Ever been to Nassau, Adewalé?

Id: [0x0006EA35]
That's a Step further than I'd go.

Id: [0x0006EA37]
I'm looking for the Observatory. Folks say you're the only Man that can Find it.

Id: [0x0006EA3D]
Mark and remember our Purpose. To guide all wayward Souls 'til they reach a quiet Road.

Id: [0x0006EA40]
According to the old Tales, the Blood of a Sage is required to enter the Observatory.

Id: [0x0006EA44]
Well that ain't possible now.

Id: [0x0006EA4B]
[Snorts, shaking his head]Prancing about like they took a Prize... hmph.

Id: [0x0006EA50]
Stop them!

Id: [0x0006EA51]
Folks are correct.

Id: [0x0006EA58]
There was a time when I thought myself the deadliest Scourge of these Seas...

Id: [0x0006EA59]
Fair Share? What is this, a fucking Monastery?

Id: [0x0006EA5B]
If you came with me, I could.

Id: [0x0006EA60]
[He takes his breath and nods at the Jungle.] After you, Captain. The Path ahead is dangerous.

Id: [0x0006EA61]
Should I find comfort in that? You murdered our Brothers and Sisters in Havana!

Id: [0x0006EA69]
[laugh]I think he talks too bloody Much. Thinks too highly of Himself and his... Ethics.

Id: [0x0006EA6B]
We cannot resupply Nassau out here by Force and Accident alone. We should go to Charles-Towne for the Lot.

Id: [0x0006EA6D]
Now set your Staysails!

Id: [0x0006EA72]
[SP][Señor Duncan Walpole](Mr. Duncan Walpole).

Id: [0x0006EA74]
You've already given me what I need.

Id: [0x0006EA7F]
Obviously. Men are simpler to mine than gold. And you can breed them like cattle.

Id: [0x0006EA80]
Uh, one Day I should like to learn to defend myself properly. To strike Fear into a Man's Heart before he even lays a Hand on my Person. But I'm not as young as I once was.

Id: [0x0006EA89]
I met Mister Thatch month or so ago and he offered to take me under his Yardarms, so to speak. Says I must wash the Hayseed from my Hair before I'm a true Pirate.

Id: [0x0006EA8F]
I consider this the first Payment in a long-term Investment. [SP][Gracias.](Thank you.)

Id: [0x0006EA91]
Anything that isn't Blood is usually survivable. From what you describe I'd guess you were suffering from a mild Food-Poisoning, or in the Clutches of a common Stomach Flu.

Id: [0x0006EA98]
Ah... that is a Relief, Sir. Havana is also my Destination. Our Ways lie together!

Id: [0x0006EA9E]
Edward?

Id: [0x0006EAA0]
So where's the best Squat in town? I'm dying for a quick Kip. Or a Siesta, should I say?

Id: [0x0006EAA1]
O, I see. Yes, that is a bustling Strait.

Id: [0x0006EAA2]
Christ.

Id: [0x0006EAAD]
And, ah, how is Mrs. Rogers these days?

Id: [0x0006EAB1]
How do you mean?

Id: [0x0006EABC]
I regret most of them already.

Id: [0x0006EAC1]
So those Pirates there just sailed away with a living fortune? Lucky mugs.

Id: [0x0006EAC3]
Look upon these Images and commit them to Memory. They tell a very old and important Story.

Id: [0x0006EAC5]
X

Id: [0x0006EACD]
Oh, I haven't the faintest Idea. We've been separated almost two years.

Id: [0x0006EAD1]
Natural Allies then.

Id: [0x0006EAD3]
Obliged.

Id: [0x0006EAD7]
And look here, two barrels of gunpowder closer than man and wife, fit to explode at the touch of a spark. Why aren't these safely stowed?

Id: [0x0006EAD8]
I'll handle it.

Id: [0x0006EADA]
But I shouldn’t worry about being waylaid by Pirates, Truth be told. My Ship is small and I have Nothing of immense Value. Sugarcane and its Yields. Molasses, Rum, that Sort of Thing.

Id: [0x0006EADD]
Hmph.[He turns]Caroline...

Id: [0x0006EAE2]
We was lead to believe Nassau was a Place where Men did as they pleased.

Id: [0x0006EAE4]
Um... I'm just headed to a... a public House now to meet some Merchants. I could... I could show you the Way.

Id: [0x0006EAE7]
[gruffly]Edward, is it?

Id: [0x0006EAEB]
Is that all?

Id: [0x0006EAED]
Of all the Money that e'er I had, / I spent it in good Company. / And all the Harm that e'er I've done, / Alas! it was to none but me. / And all I've done for want of Wit / To Mem'ry now, I can't recall / So fill to me the parting Glass / Good Night and Joy be with you all.

Id: [0x0006EAF0]
We're jumping in to this, Man. No Arguments.

Id: [0x0006EAF3]
Oh, put a Cork in it, Bonnet. You're twenty-six going on ten.

Id: [0x0006EAF8]
What's this?

Id: [0x0006EB03]
You hear that, Mister Wraggs? My young Friend returns with Offerings, and so saves your scrawny Neck![a beat] Will you not thank him?

Id: [0x0006EB05]
What's got into you, Man?

Id: [0x0006EB06]
I sent a Party ashore to Barter with the Governor. That were a Week ago. No Noise since.

Id: [0x0006EB09]
X

Id: [0x0006EB15]
It's no Ruse, Vane. I heard it straight from the Mouth of a greasy Bermudan Captain. There's a Pardon on offer for any Pirate that wants it.

Id: [0x0006EB18]
Not this time. No, my fortune is secured in Kingston this very moment. Locked safely away.

Id: [0x0006EB1A]
Though I will not know your face by Sight, I believe I can recognize the Costume made infamous by your secret Order.

Id: [0x0006EB1C]
Oh ho! The Captain of this Fleet's a canny one! Giving us a good Run for our Efforts.

Id: [0x0006EB20]
Hm... Uh...

Id: [0x0006EB28]
Mary?

Id: [0x0006EB2C]
He still won't attack an English Flag, but he'll strut and squawk before Spaniards and Frenchman that can’t understand a Word he's saying.

Id: [0x0006EB2D]
I'll handle it.[Beat] Give me a Day.

Id: [0x0006EB2E]
Well, good Luck to you then. Worse Men have become better under Blackbeard's Watch.

Id: [0x0006EB32]
Sorry to hear.

Id: [0x0006EB34]
I have no good answer.

Id: [0x0006EB35]
There's not a Pirate living who'd turn his Back on a Keg of Rum.

Id: [0x0006EB3A]
The British Commodore Peter Chamberlaine has Mustered an Armada disguised as merchants to attack your Hideout.

Id: [0x0006EB3F]
How Ridiculous. A merry Life and a short One, that's my Motto. It's all the Optimism I can muster.

Id: [0x0006EB41]
Your name's not James, is it?

Id: [0x0006EB42]
Burgess and Cockram, aye. I'll find you when they're Dead.

Id: [0x0006EB46]
Sadly, for the Application of my Art, yes. I can do Nothing except suggest Rest and ample Hydration.

Id: [0x0006EB48]
Despite my Distaste for your Eagerness, I see in you a Touch of untested Genius.[Beat] I'm Bartholomew Roberts.

Id: [0x0006EB4E]
Drop a Raft. Take him to Shore.

Id: [0x0006EB55]
Anyone speak English? [SP][¿Inglés?](English?)

Id: [0x0006EB5D]
Well, lead on.

Id: [0x0006EB5E]
And nothing for the Pain itself?

Id: [0x0006EB60]
And for main course, let's feast on one of the Guns herself. [She stands over a cannon and points to all the relevant parts as she talks] Right. A clogged touch hole here, needs scraping; bit of corrosion on the body; Barrel swabs as naked as knives; And breech ropes so rotted I could use them for knitting yarn.

Id: [0x0006EB63]
Truth is.. Appearance is our effective Weapon. Appear to be that which Men fear, and they will submit.

Id: [0x0006EB66]
Well, yes... yes, I suppose that's true.

Id: [0x0006EB68]
Mm hm!

Id: [0x0006EB6C]
Oh!

Id: [0x0006EB72]
Edward.[beat] Our meetings were an Indiscretion on my part. I regret our association and ask that you ... that you-

Id: [0x0006EB73]
Hello! A-are we victorious?

Id: [0x0006EB75]
Save keeping others from doing the Same, aye.

Id: [0x0006EB76]
Shut your fucking Gob or I fill it with Shot. You hear me?

Id: [0x0006EB7C]
Oh, you put me at Ease, Sir. To think I took you for a Pirate when you first appeared.

Id: [0x0006EB7E]
Not most Days. Come on.

Id: [0x0006EB84]
But this man is a fearsome Dog that feeds off Trouble and Turmoil...

Id: [0x0006EB87]
Reality, Mate. Reality.[turns to Adé] See that you ain't pulled into the Drink by this drowning Rat.

Id: [0x0006EB8A]
[A Sigh]Lost your Man again, did you?

Id: [0x0006EB97]
Chamberlaine? The Templar?

Id: [0x0006EB98]
By the Father of Understanding's Light, let our Work now begin.

Id: [0x0006EBA1]
What's his name?

Id: [0x0006EBA5]
She's a fine Woman, and I trust she's well. But I've heard nothing, having been away these fourteen months hunting Pirates in Madagascar.

Id: [0x0006EBA8]
We're looking out for Merchants, Boys. Them that's fat with Cargo!

Id: [0x0006EBAE]
Only imagine what it would mean to have such a Power.[beat] With this Device, there would be no Secrets among men. No lies. No trickery. Only Justice. Pure Justice.

Id: [0x0006EBAF]
[SP][Su más humilde servidor, el gobernador Laureano Torres y Ayala.](Your most humble Servant, Governor Laureano Torres y Ayala.)

Id: [0x0006EBB1]
Ah, you Spaniards. Your long Ties to the Moors have diluted your Blood and softened your Hearts.

Id: [0x0006EBB6]
Oy! I've lived longer than most Men who trod this Path!

Id: [0x0006EBBB]
Aye. They're coming for you now.

Id: [0x0006EBC3]
Bag of Shite! Do you hear me? It's a Bag of bloody Shite!

Id: [0x0006EBCD]
I'll remember your Face.

Id: [0x0006EBCE]
I'd be happy to apply an experimental Clyster if you wish - a Potage of Red Wine, Beef Tea, and a few potent Herbs injected up your Posterior. This may help dull some-

Id: [0x0006EBD0]
I've no Secrets to share with you now. But if you'll lend me your Aid in two months time, West of the Leeward islands, well... it's there you'll get some Answers. I promise you.

Id: [0x0006EBD2]
You'll all be dead Men!

Id: [0x0006EBE4]
Little Bit.

Id: [0x0006EBE9]
Ben thinks of himself as a Man of persuasive Charisma.

Id: [0x0006EBEE]
Anchor's weighed, Sir!

Id: [0x0006EBFA]
This is not to say I believe in the natural Equality of all Races or Sexes. Surely men with Talent and Intelligence should lead. But there is no true Profit to be gained by the practice of Slavery.

Id: [0x0006EC06]
Ah.. It’s the Devil men fear, not their Fathers.

Id: [0x0006EC08]
That you leave her be. Her reputation will not survive with you buzzing about like a love-sick Wasp.

Id: [0x0006EC13]
You'll be seeing it again.

Id: [0x0006EC17]
Did you?

Id: [0x0006EC1E]
Ah, but Nothing ingestible?

Id: [0x0006EC24]
A Pox on you, Traitor! You sold us down River!

Id: [0x0006EC2B]
You ask far too many questions, boy.

Id: [0x0006EC2C]
Aye. Roberts is a Devil, with a queer Aversion to Kindness.[Beat, smiles] I suppose that's two Men I've lost today. So... what's your real Name, Lass?

Id: [0x0006EC2E]
I'll be with you, Kenway. I will.

Id: [0x0006EC32]
Tell your Friends we're stealing your Goods. And we won't hurt Nobody if everyone stays as still as a Sandbar. You got that?

Id: [0x0006EC36]
Captain, is it an Ship you run here, or an asylum?

Id: [0x0006EC3C]
Hey, I warned him...

Id: [0x0006EC3F]
Oh, puffer-duff... I have led us astray, Duncan.

Id: [0x0006EC41]
This Morning, I'd have said the Former. Now I cant be sure.

Id: [0x0006EC47]
I’ve seen him clear the Deck of Slaver’s ship, like he was swabbing on the Sabbath.

Id: [0x0006EC4B]
Peace, Commodore Chamberlaine. We are Messengers, not Executioners.[beat] Not yet.

Id: [0x0006EC4E]
For I have dipped my Hands in muddied Waters, and withdrawing them find 'tis better to be a Commander than a Common man!

Id: [0x0006EC5A]
In the short Term it makes us Money, [SP][Si](Yes), but in the long Term it will render us the Victims of our own Success.

Id: [0x0006EC5C]
Ah ... uh ... please to repeat?

Id: [0x0006EC5D]
Oh, all the Comrades that e'er I had, / They're sorry for my going away, / And all the Sweethearts that e'er I've loved, / They'd wish me one more Day to stay, / But since it falls unto my Lot, / That I should rise and you should not, / I'll gently rise and softly call, / Good Night and Joy be with you all.

Id: [0x0006EC63]
Let fall the Courses! We're going Home!

Id: [0x0006EC65]
We should quit these Waters, Thatch. The Governor is bound to muster more Soldiers.

Id: [0x0006EC6C]
Not on Board, no. We might have success speaking with the Natives of Hispaniola, however. I've heard Tales of natural Remedies there that rival many of our modern Cures.

Id: [0x0006EC6D]
I fear I am not Built for the Fatigue and Care required to live as a Man of Fortune.

Id: [0x0006EC6F]
Daddy...

Id: [0x0006EC70]
And would you be the Devil?

Id: [0x0006EC7A]
Mr. Walpole... let’s collect your Reward.

Id: [0x0006EC7B]
Your Father tells me you aim to Join the Navy next year. This I heartily endorse. So much so that I have arranged for your Deployment tomorrow afternoon.

Id: [0x0006EC7C]
Ah, but you and I, sir - old as we are - will not live to see that unfortunate Day. So why bother?

Id: [0x0006EC7E]
I'd make that Decision, for a Pirate cannot win every battle with sneers and pistol shots.

Id: [0x0006EC81]
Hispaniola, good. I'll ask Adé to take a Reckoning. Better, I think, to have ready supply of oral Suppressants than a Queue of miserable Men in need of a good Flushing.

Id: [0x0006EC89]
This is the Observatory's promise. And we must take it for our own.

Id: [0x0006EC97]
Mary Read to my Mum. And them I call Friends.

Id: [0x0006EC9A]
Yes! You have an... uncommon way of handling yourself. Quick and easy, if I may say. Gave me quite a Fright!

Id: [0x0006ECB6]
Either way, sir. You're the Captain.

Id: [0x0006ECBD]
Oh, for fuck's Sake.

Id: [0x0006ECC4]
No, indeed. Would you take it upon yourself to train these men, and set their Habits right? You have my full support.

Id: [0x0006ECC7]
Do we know its Whereabouts?

Id: [0x0006ECD0]
[Smiles]Only for an Audience[laugh]. It’s all a big Show.[a beat] Give your Quarry something to fear, some hellish Thing from a fever’d Dream, and Men will drop to their Knees pleading for God before aught else.

Id: [0x0006ECD7]
Nah, you go on ahead. I got some Business in the North.

Id: [0x0006ECDC]
We will soon. For in our Custody is the one Man who does. A man named Roberts, once called a Sage.

Id: [0x0006ECDF]
But all Things considered, I think it's turned out to be a rather fortuitous Day, hasn't it?

Id: [0x0006ECE0]
Fan out! Search every Nook and Cranny!

Id: [0x0006ECE3]
Or fight like a Devil dressed as a man in plain view of the King’s Navy.

Id: [0x0006ECE6]
It's unlikely a Peasant like you could ever become an Officer. But perhaps by some Miracle you will one day become a Man.

Id: [0x0006ECEB]
Forgive my Impatience. But how far is it yet?

Id: [0x0006ECF0]
Ruse or no, I think it's plain the British may return to Nassau. With Arms no doubt.[A beat] We'll need a Plan.

Id: [0x0006ECF2]
Meet me in Charles-towne. One Month from Today.

Id: [0x0006ECF9]
Oh, no Matter. I'll get us a better View. What are we looking for?

Id: [0x0006ED02]
I'd have done it without you asking, but its nice to hear it said.

Id: [0x0006ED03]
Abstergo Divertissements. [Both FR and EN versions of the following line:] How can I direct your call?

Id: [0x0006ED09]
Uh, a Tavern! With a sort of Courtyard Interior.

Id: [0x0006ED0B]
Looks fine.

Id: [0x0006ED0C]
We are nearly there.

Id: [0x0006ED0D]
Lock 'em in the Hold, and take Everything that isn't nailed down.

Id: [0x0006ED14]
As soon as you're ready to run exercises, send word.

Id: [0x0006ED1D]
Look, the Sample 17 teams are in full production mode right now, and the Kenway line is our priority... But-

Id: [0x0006ED20]
You're done, aren't you? Giving up on us? On Nassau?

Id: [0x0006ED21]
This building is barely six months old, but Abstergo Entertainment has been a studio for a few years. Since 2010.

Id: [0x0006ED22]
Can you see her?

Id: [0x0006ED23]
Of course it does.

Id: [0x0006ED28]
Grab an oar, Bonnet. This Boat won’t row itself.[effort]

Id: [0x0006ED3B]
Aye Captain. It'll be some hours. But this evening by the latest.

Id: [0x0006ED46]
...You, Mary Read and Anne Bonny, are to go from hence to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution; where you shall be severally hanged by the Neck till you are severally dead, dead, dead.

Id: [0x0006ED48]
Well-[Beat] Well, unless you are specifically ordering me to abandon it, I won't jeopardize our flagship project. Edward Kenway is the-

Id: [0x0006ED4A]
Look, Lad. I'm late into my fourth Decade on this Earth. And if I don't find some Means to make the Fifth a quiet and cozy Voyage, I'd rather sink to the Devil's Doorstep than call myself Captain another Year.

Id: [0x0006ED50]
And for such a Young Man, well, he knows his Way around every Crag and Crevasse of these Islands.

Id: [0x0006ED5C]
O rot!

Id: [0x0006ED5F]
That was just the tip of the iceberg. Soon we'll be unveiling commercial Animus servers for the whole world to enjoy.

Id: [0x0006ED64]
Indeed they will. But... thanks to Duncan and the Information he has delivered, the Assassins won't be a Problem for much longer.

Id: [0x0006ED6C]
[Clearing his throat]Now, where... Where can a Man find a bit of Ruff. D'ya know what, I mean?

Id: [0x0006ED71]
May God in his infinite Mercy be merciful to each of your Souls...

Id: [0x0006ED74]
My Goodness, you are an agile Chap!

Id: [0x0006ED75]
Man the Cannons!

Id: [0x0006ED76]
We'll meet again, Lad. In this World[a beat] or the One below.

Id: [0x0006ED79]
Hm. Best be sheeting Home. You following?

Id: [0x0006ED7C]
But this is... but this is how Hollywood got its start, right? With pirate movies! Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn. And now we have access to the real deal!

Id: [0x0006ED83]
Every Finger's a Fishhook! That's how you tell a true Sailor.

Id: [0x0006ED86]
So if it’s Fortune you seek, or an aimless Adventure, or just a little Fame, then Captain Edward Kenway is your Man...

Id: [0x0006ED87]
Caroline! Come!

Id: [0x0006ED89]
All will be made clear tomorrow, Gentlemen, when you meet the Sage for yourselves. Until then... let us drink.

Id: [0x0006ED8A]
Aye. Close behind.

Id: [0x0006ED8C]
They'll offer passive experiences, of course. Edited versions of real history. But only the exciting parts.

Id: [0x0006ED95]
[Laughs]Ah ha! Yes. A fine Way to put it.

Id: [0x0006ED9B]
[Annoyed Breath][FR][Oui, oui...](Yes...), Exactly.[Beat] We'll talk about all that together at the shareholders event.[Beat] Right.[Beat] Looking forward to seeing you.

Id: [0x0006ED9D]
We’re pregnant!

Id: [0x0006EDA1]
Let us find the Observatory together. For with its Power, Kings will fall, Clergy will cower, and the Hearts and Minds of the World will be ours.

Id: [0x0006EDA3]
Take care, Laetitia.

Id: [0x0006EDA9]
What the Devil did she say?

Id: [0x0006EDAA]
Only don't meddle in his private Affairs... for there's more Mystery to Him than even I dare ask.

Id: [0x0006EDAB]
In the Absence of any clear Ideas, I say we lay low. No Piracies and no Violence. Do nothing to ruffle the King's Feathers for now.

Id: [0x0006EDB4]
Ah! We have arrived.

Id: [0x0006EDB5]
They plead their Bellies, Milord.

Id: [0x0006EDBB]
Aye! You can't hang a Woman quick with Child, can ya?

Id: [0x0006EDC3]
Preserving the King's Plumage is no concern of mine, Ben.

Id: [0x0006EDC5]
Quiet! Quiet![Pause] If what you claim is true, then your Executions will be stayed, but ONLY until your Terms are up.

Id: [0x0006EDCC]
Then I’ll be up the Duff the next time you come knocking!

Id: [0x0006EDD4]
Remove them!

Id: [0x0006EDE0]
Sorry about the swift Exit. Bit of a Misunderstanding.

Id: [0x0006EDE3]
One heaped upon another.[Pain sigh]

Id: [0x0006EDE4]
Ah, Jaysus. I'm sorry Mate, this is my Doing. I'm only trying to keep these Spanish Eyes off Me.

Id: [0x0006EDE5]
Oh, it's no Bother. [A pause]Regrettably, these Soldiers confiscated my Sugar. And your Dispatches.

Id: [0x0006EDE9]
Damn! And where've they gone?

Id: [0x0006EDEB]
I haven't the foggiest Idea, I'm afraid. I suspect those Chaps might but my Spanish is [SP][muy maldad](very evil), so I'd- I'd rather not ask.

Id: [0x0006EDF6]
See someone you know?

Id: [0x0006EDF7]
No, no, no. Just putting on a friendly Face. I shouldn’t want to be mistaken for a Pirate again.

Id: [0x0006EDFE]
It's mad to think Spain and England were at War two Years ago, isn't it? Here I am, bartering with Spaniards like they were my Cousins.

Id: [0x0006EE26]
All right. Come on, let's follow 'em and recover my Maps.

Id: [0x0006EE27]
I'll hide just here, shall I?

Id: [0x0006EE32]
I suppose not.

Id: [0x0006EE5C]
It has been forty-five Years since anyone has seen a true Sage. Can you be sure this one is authentic?

Id: [0x0006EE5D]
We are confident he is.

Id: [0x0006EE7D]
Very punctual, Duncan. This way.

Id: [0x0006EE8B]
Edward Kenway, you've tossed yourself into worse, but always with a better Plan.[Takes a deep breath]

Id: [0x0006EEA3]
I'll catch you up!

Id: [0x0006EEA5]
You- You're not leaving me?

Id: [0x0006EEA6]
[SP][¡Fuera de la carretera!](Clear the Road!)

Id: [0x0006EEBB]
That's the one we want. It is not her lucky day.

Id: [0x0006EEBD]
Let's have a little less talk and more seamanship from the likes of you.

Id: [0x0006EEBF]
Shut up and man the deck, ye scurvy dog.

Id: [0x0006EEC1]
We'd be fools to sail that way now Captain.

Id: [0x0006EEC3]
Aye Captain, looks to be a fishing village.. They are sure to have a Shipwright.

Id: [0x0006EEC5]
Aye, time to claim the seas.

Id: [0x0006EEC7]
Aye.. I've heard they call it a Ship Graveyard… (pause, and lamenting) The sea is a harsh mistress.

Id: [0x0006EEC9]
We have more pressing concerns  ye fool, don't trouble the Captain with such.

Id: [0x0006EECB]
All hands on deck!

Id: [0x0006EECD]
Brace yourselves, men! Rough seas ahead!

Id: [0x0006EECF]
Time to get rich. All hands on deck! Let's give em' hell Captain!

Id: [0x0006EED1]
Let the rats kill each other I say, we've no part in this.

Id: [0x0006EED3]
Ho! Some British scum chasing our brethren! Let's show em' what happens to those who trifle with Pirates.

Id: [0x0006EED5]
That's that. Let's hope they remember the favour.

Id: [0x0006EED7]
Captain! She looks about to blow! Grab what you can and get off that Ship!

Id: [0x0006EED9]
Great work Captain! Now get off that thing before she blows sky high!

Id: [0x0006EEDB]
That crashed ship is on fire, perhaps we can salvage her before she sinks.

Id: [0x0006EEDD]
Captain! She's about to blow, get off that ship while ye still can!

Id: [0x0006EEDF]
A fine haul Captain, and ye escaped with yer hide intact, well done sir.

Id: [0x0006EEE1]
To arms, men, to arms!

Id: [0x0006EEE3]
Yells

Id: [0x0006EEE5]
!*I've heard men tell tails of such.. But I never thought to see one..

Id: [0x0006EEE7]
!*It is a good day to sail, sir.

Id: [0x0006EEE9]
!*What fine weather.

Id: [0x0006EEEB]
!*Careful, Captain!

Id: [0x0006EEED]
!*Aye aye, Captain!

Id: [0x0006EEEF]
!*Aye, Sir!

Id: [0x0006EEF1]
!*Enemy incoming!

Id: [0x0006EEF3]
!*Enemy incoming!

Id: [0x0006EEF5]
!*Hostiles!

Id: [0x0006EEF7]
!*Ambush! Ambush!!!!

Id: [0x0006EEF9]
!*Look over there, Cap'n!

Id: [0x0006EEFB]
!*Look over there, Cap'n!

Id: [0x0006EEFD]
!*Oh Christ!

Id: [0x0006EEFF]
!*Oh Christ!

Id: [0x0006EF01]
!*Oh Christ!

Id: [0x0006EF03]
!*We're taking fire!

Id: [0x0006EF05]
!*A storm's coming sir!

Id: [0x0006EF07]
!*We're sailing into the fray, sir!

Id: [0x0006EF09]
!*yeaahhh!!

Id: [0x0006EF7C]
Oh God!

Id: [0x0006EF7D]
Another Wave!

Id: [0x0006EF7E]
Careful!

Id: [0x0006EF7F]
Yah!

Id: [0x0006EF8E]
[Grunt pain.]

Id: [0x0006EFAC]
I think I see the Place! We're not far!

Id: [0x0006EFAF]
Sorry about the Sugar. I've only one Pair of Hands.

Id: [0x0006EFB0]
Don't settle for Tedium. Sail for Nassau. Live Life as you see fit.

Id: [0x0006EFB1]
[Laughs] Haven't I heard that Nassau is crawling with Pirates? Seems a very tawdry Place.

Id: [0x0006EFB2]
Not tawdry. Liberated.

Id: [0x0006EFB4]
Oh, God, that would be an Adventure.[Catches himself] But no, no... I'm a Husband and a Father, I have Responsibilities. Life can't be all Pleasure and Distraction, Duncan.

Id: [0x0006EFB5]
Hey, ah, Bonnet. [A pause]The name's Edward, in Truth. Duncan's only a Handle.

Id: [0x0006EFB7]
Ah... a secret Name for your secret Meeting with the Governor.

Id: [0x0006EFBC]
It is said that most Pirates now make their home in Nassau, out on New Providence. Is this true? Have you been there yourself?

Id: [0x0006EFBD]
It is, and I have. Briefly.

Id: [0x0006EFBE]
Fascinating. I hear they are quite a drain on your King's resources.

Id: [0x0006EFC5]
You recognize this, I think.

Id: [0x0006EFC8]
[SP][Sí.](Yes.) Beset on all Sides by our Enemies. We must be more cautious.

Id: [0x0006EFE2]
We have the Key. Now we need only its Location. Perhaps Mister Roberts will be eager to provide it.

Id: [0x0006EFE4]
Right. Flash Rogue like yourself must be cautious.

Id: [0x0006EFE5]
Not if you keep quiet and stay out of Sight.

Id: [0x0006EFE6]
And yours... seeing as how most Pirates are of English stock, and most of their targets are Spaniards.

Id: [0x0006EFE7]
That will change. Men of base Morality are rarely sentimental. And the hungrier these Pirates get, the less they will care what Flag their Prey flies.

Id: [0x0006EFF8]
Jaysus, let that Dream go, Lad. Nassau is the place to be, not England.

Id: [0x0006EFFD]
[To Thatch]Hand over the Docket I lent you.[back to Edward.] If we're to keep our Republic afloat, we'll need Guns as well as Gold.

Id: [0x0006F002]
That means attacking the Navy.

Id: [0x0006F00B]
Then let us find the Observatory. If it does what these Templars claim, we'll be unbeatable.

Id: [0x0006F00C]
Not that Twaddle again, Kenway! That's a Story for Schoolboys. I mean proper Defences. Steal a Galleon, Shift all the guns to one Side.[beat] Would make a nice Ornament for one of our Harbours.

Id: [0x0006F00D]
It will not be easy to steal a full Spanish Galleon. Have you one in mind?

Id: [0x0006F00E]
I do, Sir. And I'll show you. She's a Fussock she is. Fat and slow.[small laugh]

Id: [0x0006F011]
You're a Wonder, Kenway. You've a Knack for this kind of Work.

Id: [0x0006F012]
It ain't Work if you love it.

Id: [0x0006F013]
[laughing]Ah! Ah! Tosh!

Id: [0x0006F075]
Hang me. That's the Map I sold to Governor Torres in Havana.

Id: [0x0006F087]
Like staring through a Waterfall.

Id: [0x0006F08D]
Was that for us?

Id: [0x0006F08E]
No, it were two Chasers.

Id: [0x0006F093]
Shite....

Id: [0x0006F095]
If we don't stop 'em dead in the Water, they'll scare off our Prize.

Id: [0x0006F0A1]
I know the Man. And if he sees my Ship, he'll know it from his time in Havana. Meaning he may wonder at who's sailing her now.[Beat, flatly] I can't risk that.

Id: [0x0006F0A4]
You remember the Gift you gave me?[He pulls the blade out.] Well it answers just fine.

Id: [0x0006F0A5]
I pity you,[FR][Boucanier](Buccaneer). After all you have seen, after all we showed you of our Order, still you embrace the Life of an ignorant and aimless Rogue.[suffering]

Id: [0x0006F0A8]
Oh, ah ... I pressed a few off your Crew to help me drag this Beastie home. Hope its no Issue.

Id: [0x0006F0A9]
We'll make due. Good luck and fair winds to ye!

Id: [0x0006F28A]
James tells me you treated with the Templars there. Did you see the Man they call The Sage?

Id: [0x0006F28B]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006F28C]
Would you recognize his Face if you saw it again?

Id: [0x0006F28D]
I reckon so...

Id: [0x0006F28F]
I must be certain.

Id: [0x0006F2B0]
Keep this up and Nassau'll be the first City where Men and Women may live as God made them, easy and free.

Id: [0x0006F2B2]
All it takes is a few Drops of Blood, Sweat, and a Swatch of Cloth...

Id: [0x0006F2B6]
We fly no Colours out here, but praise the Lack of 'em. So let the Black Flag signal nothing but your Allegiance to Man's natural Freedoms. This one's yours.[a beat] Fly it proud.

Id: [0x0006F2B7]
I will.

Id: [0x0006F2BB]
All right, Captain Kenway. You've earned a Look.

Id: [0x0006F2BF]
Ah... that all Men are Sheep. And that an old Wolf like me deserves every Ounce of Blood he draws.

Id: [0x0006F2C3]
Hold it!

Id: [0x0006F2EB]
You think maybe you owe them a bit of a Warning then? If you have any kind of Heart beating in that Chest?

Id: [0x0006F2FF]
Jaysus. That's him. The Sage. But this thing must be hundreds of Years old.

Id: [0x0006F300]
Older still.[he points] You're certain it's him?

Id: [0x0006F302]
Aye. It's the Eyes that Mark him.

Id: [0x0006F320]
The Word is the Cuban Governor himself is fixing to receive a Mess of Gold from a nearby Fort. Until then, it's just sitting there, itching to be took.

Id: [0x0006F367]
Well, I'll be buggered! What an active Day we've had, Gents!

Id: [0x0006F36A]
I would like you to be present for the Interrogation tomorrow. Call around Noon.

Id: [0x0006F36B]
Yes, Sir.

Id: [0x0006F3AA]
[laugh]Godfrey Lijah, we made it!

Id: [0x0006F3AC]
Oh what a Mess! Jaysus.

Id: [0x0006F3AF]
[small laugh]By God, we pulled this one straight from the Teeth of Neptune...

Id: [0x0006F3B1]
I'm Edward. Much thanks for your Aid back there.

Id: [0x0006F3B3]
Adewalé.

Id: [0x0006F3B4]
[Smiles]Not yet.

Id: [0x0006F3C7]
I think this Cove suits you best, Edward. Better than that Costume does.

Id: [0x0006F3C8]
Oh, Come on now... we're Pirates, Kidd. We take as we please and become who we like. Self-made Men!

Id: [0x0006F3C9]
But that Look ain't you. It's not who you are.

Id: [0x0006F3CA]
Who am I then?

Id: [0x0006F3CB]
Hard to tell some Days. All I know is, you like dangerous Prizes.

Id: [0x0006F3CC]
Like the Observatory?[beat] I think you know more about that than you let on in Nassau.

Id: [0x0006F3CD]
You noticed that, did ya?

Id: [0x0006F3D8]
[Laughs]The Legend grows.

Id: [0x0006F3E8]
Did the Templars say why they wanted this Sage?

Id: [0x0006F3E9]
They drew some of his Blood into a little Glass Cube.

Id: [0x0006F3EA]
Hm.[beat] We're finished here.

Id: [0x0006F3F7]
The Statue in the Temple. Was that the Man you saw in Havana?

Id: [0x0006F3F8]
Spitting Likeness, aye.

Id: [0x0006F415]
Bastard's been a Target for Years. Bloody Hell, we nearly had him!

Id: [0x0006F417]
By God, you Bravos are a cheery Bunch eh. All Frowns and furrowed Brows.

Id: [0x0006F41C]
Governor Torres himself, eh?[To Blackbeard] Sounds promising.

Id: [0x0006F43A]
You can't trust Anyone, it seems.[Grunt]

Id: [0x0006F485]
I've had this Sense most of my Life... only I thought it was related in some way to my Dreaming, or the like.

Id: [0x0006F48C]
I cannot return to a Place I have never been. I was born in Trinidad, a Slave from my first Breath.

Id: [0x0006F48D]
Ah. But wouldn't you feel... I don't know... More welcome there?

Id: [0x0006F48E]
As you might feel more welcome in Paris?

Id: [0x0006F491]
This Captain claims the Princess sails out of Kingston every few Months.

Id: [0x0006F495]
You made Hash of my Sails and Rigging, Jackanapes! You owe me a Share.

Id: [0x0006F497]
[Screams in Pain]Ah!

Id: [0x0006F4AA]
So what'll you do with your Share of the Gold we take from Governor Torres? Return to Africa? Prince among Men?

Id: [0x0006F4AE]
[laugh]With this Skin and this Voice, where can I go in the World and feel at Ease? This Country here is my best Chance. This Country called Jackdaw, where I know the Names of all Citizens, and they know Mine, and we work together. Not always out of Love, but to keep our Country afloat.

Id: [0x0006F4B1]
I think I understand ye. Let's take her, then.[beat] For the Citizens of Jackdaw!

Id: [0x0006F4B7]
I know your Face, Pirate. But your name was borrowed the last time we spoke.

Id: [0x0006F4B8]
Ah, yes. I recall... Mister Duncan Walpole, I miss that One.

Id: [0x0006F4BC]
I'd rather not say.

Id: [0x0006F4BE]
And I'd rather not cut your Lips off and feed 'em to you.

Id: [0x0006F4BF]
Two Years ago we offered a Reward for the Sage's Recapture. Today someone claims to have found him. This Gold is his Ransom.

Id: [0x0006F4C1]
Who found him?

Id: [0x0006F4C3]
[Breath]A Slaver by the Name of Laurens Prins. He lives in Kingston.

Id: [0x0006F4C6]
We like this Story, Torres. [Beat]And we want to help you finish it. But we're going to do it our Way.[Beat] Using you and your Gold.

Id: [0x0006F4CD]
Come on, Mate. Once we have the Sage, we'll all be rich!

Id: [0x0006F4CE]
Not if young Master Kidd gets to him first.

Id: [0x0006F4CF]
Jaysus, that Lad's here to kill him.

Id: [0x0006F4D9]
Virtue. [Laughs] Torres. I have no Wish to waste my Day chattering about Slaves and their pitiable Condition. Let us conclude this Transaction, then celebrate as Friends.

Id: [0x0006F4F8]
You mistake my Motive, Old Man. I'm only after a bit of Coin...

Id: [0x0006F50A]
Oh God! Oh God, Save me! And flay all you Devils! Ah!

Id: [0x0006F50E]
A great Disappointment you are, Thatch!

Id: [0x0006F510]
His Mind's made up to stay, he says. So Sod 'im! And hang all you that follow this sorry Bastard into Obscurity!

Id: [0x0006F514]
[spits and sniffs and a pause]That Man's a Prick.

Id: [0x0006F517]
When Ben and me first set down in Nassau, I under-valued the Need for Folks of Character to shape and guide the Place to it's full Purpose.

Id: [0x0006F518]
But I was not wrong about the Corruption that comes with that Course. Once a man gets a taste of Leadership, it's hard for him not to wonder why he ain't in charge of the whole World.

Id: [0x0006F519]
I know these Men think me a fine Captain, but I bloody hate the Taste of it. I'm arrogant. I Lack the Balance needed to Lead from Behind the Crowd.

Id: [0x0006F520]
You still looking for that Sage Fellow?

Id: [0x0006F521]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006F522]
Taking a Prize a Month back, I heard a Man named Roberts was working a Slave Ship called the Princess. [Breath]Might want to see about it.

Id: [0x0006F524]
The Princess.[Beat] Cheers, Thatch.

Id: [0x0006F539]
Now don't stand there like a Barrel of wet Fish. We're celebrating my Retirement!

Id: [0x0006F54B]
Where's Thatch?

Id: [0x0006F54E]
Captain, what the Hell happened back there?

Id: [0x0006F560]
Come at me, Roysters! You scurvy Maggot Brains!

Id: [0x0006F5C3]
Aye. We'll use Rackham's Ship. He ain't a capable Captain.

Id: [0x0006F5CD]
My Conscience is clear.

Id: [0x0006F5E6]
Or soft in Parts that should be hard.

Id: [0x0006F5F3]
Ahoy, Kidd. You missed quite a Time.

Id: [0x0006F60E]
I've no Stomach for you and your Mystics, Mary. I want a Taste of the good Life.[beat] An easy Life.

Id: [0x0006F60F]
No one honest has an easy Life, Edward. And it's aching for one that causes the most Pain.

Id: [0x0006F61A]
I concur, Grandmaster. I should have Sailed there myself. One of my Slave Galleys would be more than capable of making a swift Journey.

Id: [0x0006F61B]
Slave Galley? Captain, I asked you to divest yourself of that sick Institution.

Id: [0x0006F61C]
I fail to see the Difference between enslaving some Men and all Men. Our aim is to Steer the entire Course of Civilization, is it not?

Id: [0x0006F61D]
A Body enslaved inspires the Mind to revolt. But enslave a Man's Mind, and his Body will follow on naturally. Efficiently.

Id: [0x0006F61F]
A fair Point, Grand Master.[beat]

Id: [0x0006F62B]
Edward.

Id: [0x0006F63A]
What news Adé?

Id: [0x0006F63C]
I haven't seen the Princess for eight Weeks or more. Meaning she may soon be back.

Id: [0x0006F641]
Captain Kenway. Shall we use your Ship for this next Scheme, or mine?

Id: [0x0006F642]
I'd first hear the Details before deciding.

Id: [0x0006F644]
Ah, it's a small Gambit... this Fount of Information has just told me that a nearby Galleon contains the Treasure I seek. For his Sake, I hope he's right.

Id: [0x0006F648]
Indeed. Using this Man, we'll acquire a Portuguese Flag which will get us as close to our Target as possible.

Id: [0x0006F67F]
Miss Jennifer Kenway. May I introduce myself...

Id: [0x0006F680]
Jennifer Scott, if you please.

Id: [0x0006F681]
I'm sorry. I- I...

Id: [0x0006F687]
My Daughter was raised by her Mother, Caroline, until she passed away some Years ago. Jenny prefers to use her Surname to mine.

Id: [0x0006F688]
Ah. Forgive my Ignorance.

Id: [0x0006F689]
I will.[Refers to Jenny] She may not.

Id: [0x0006F68E]
Up we go. [Beat] How's that?

Id: [0x0006F68F]
Fine. But won't your Arms tire?

Id: [0x0006F690]
Hey, I'm not so old as that! But if they do, then we shall quit this posh Gig and go and meet your Mother for some Chocolate at White's. How's that sound?

Id: [0x0006F6A8]
I had to, Lads! That Rogers was on to me from the First.

Id: [0x0006F6AA]
Hold your tongue, Rackham.

Id: [0x0006F6B4]
Laurens Prins's Blood. Useless now.

Id: [0x0006F6CD]
We came to Nassau to get away from the likes of Kings.

Id: [0x0006F6CE]
Well... I'll be a man of Property and Promise anyway.

Id: [0x0006F6D4]
What's this...?

Id: [0x0006F6D7]
[FR][Que l'enfer que tu trouveras soit le fruit de ton insouciance](May the Hell you find be of your own making.)[suffering]

Id: [0x0006F6F7]
Calm... little Puppy. And Slink Back to your Kennel. You haven't the Mettle for my Brand of Madness.

Id: [0x0006F701]
Raise a glass to Freedom, Lads! Here's to Gentlemen of Fortune and Women of Leisure!

Id: [0x0006F71A]
Remember my Creed, Boy? A short Life and a merry One. That is all.

Id: [0x0006F71D]
[Laughing]In all your Years out here, you could never achieve what I have done in one-fifth the Time.

Id: [0x0006F728]
The World owes us nothing more than this.

Id: [0x0006F72C]
What keeps you wandering? Do I not make you happy?

Id: [0x0006F744]
Why is it you alone can find what so many want?

Id: [0x0006F747]
I was born with Memories of this Place. Memories of another Time entirely, I think. Like a... like another Life I have already led.

Id: [0x0006F74A]
Curse you for a Lurch, Man, and speak some Sense.

Id: [0x0006F74B]
Dirty and decrepit. Not quite as I remember. But it has been over 80 Millennia.

Id: [0x0006F74E]
Oh, Rot. That's impossible.

Id: [0x0006F757]
More Blood Vials.

Id: [0x0006F758]
Yes. These Cubes contain the Blood of an old and ancient People. A wonderful Race, in their Time.

Id: [0x0006F76D]
This is bloody Witchcraft.

Id: [0x0006F76E]
No. This is Mister Jack Rackham. Somewhere in the World, at this Moment.

Id: [0x0006F76F]
Nassau. This is happening right now? We're seeing through his Eyes?

Id: [0x0006F770]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006F7F4]
Okay... uh... hope this is on... don't think I've ever use this phone more than a few times to record anything...[Clear his throat]uh... hey Dad... so, ah, we’re all here in New York, at the Motel... it's Queens actually... in Astoria, near the NQ... Rebecca’s off getting batteries for something, and Shaun’s in his room doing whatever Shaun does... and, ah, you’re out getting some food. Me?... well I’m supposed to be getting ready to break into a some offices in the Financial District... feels just like prepping for one of your old training drills, actually... ten years go by, and then you show up, and it’s like, ah... it’s like I was never gone, and we’re right back to the ball-busting, and the conspiracies, and the paranoia...[Pause] only this time I believe you. I believe every word... you know I don’t even think you know the half of it. I don’t think you know how much I have seen. How much I have learned in just a few weeks.[pause] Everything, really.[pause] I feel like, ah... like I've lived a thousand years. Or ten thousand maybe. It’s impossible to explain, but when you see that much of the world... through the eyes of so many... you can’t help but be sad... to see all these incredible, intelligent people fight the same battles and make the same mistakes over and over again. Because culture and knowledge and history... these things, they aren't passed on through our genes... every kid on earth needs to relearn the basics. How to live, how... how to survive, how to stand up for... for what’s right... but so much is lost in the transfer... so much is added, every generation.[Pause] It’s a shame... Over and over, everything must be learned again. [Pause, sigh] I met Clay, Dad. Clay Kazcmarek. In the Animus. I knew him by his Abstergo handle, Subject 16... my, uh, predecessor... and he showed me things. He PASSED THEM to me... just before he died, or got deleted, or whatever. Everything he’d learned, everything he'd seen... uh, God, how do I talk about this....? [Pause] So, uh, I guess you trained him, huh? After I left. He really looked up to you. And now that I've seen through his eyes, I think I understand why. I’m glad you had him around, even if I wasn’t there...[Pause] But the things he showed me... unbelievable things... And I nev- [The phone rings] Shit. Back in a second...

Id: [0x0006F7F5]
Okay, uh,... it’s been a few weeks since the last recording. Sorry about that. 'Course I... guess, it's just a few seconds for you. A leap down the playlist... hum, Anyway... uh, I was talking about Clay... uh, Kazcmarek, Subject 16.[Pause] So, when I fell into a coma back in Italy, and woke up in the Animus black room... it was uh... so calming... it felt like I... like I had woken up into a dream, a haze... a dream where none of this mess had ever happened... felt like I should be getting ready for another day of pouring drinks at Bad Weather, and uh, another day of complaining about being between girlfriends, and wondering what the hell to do with myself... but uh, when I saw Clay... just sitting there, it- it started to come back, you know, piece by piece... and... when he told me about Lucy I...[sigh] fuck, you know... it- it hurt. You know, realizing that I killed her, without thinking or feeling anything. Not at the time, anyway... [Pause] well, then things just kept piling on... with more memories of Ezio, and Altair, and the First Civilization and then... right before he vanished, Clay passed on his memories. To me... he showed me everything HE had seen, and lived through... and it was... it was brief but overwhelming. Not really sure how to explain...[pause] He saw glimpses of Adam and Eve, and their escape from Slavery... he saw the beginning and the end of the war between the First Civ and humans... he saw Minerva, and Juno, and Tinia trying to work out their... their calculations. At least that's what they called them. They had these tools... these powerful machines... that could predict POSSIBLE FUTURES... not what was GOING to happen, but what uh... Wha- what COULD happen... probabilities. And... well they spent a lot of energy trying to figure out what was the most likely scenario for the future. Their's and ours. And in the end I guess they figured I was their most likely candidate... some guy named Desmond, living at the beginning of the twenty-first century of the Common Era... but which Desmond was the right one? Because, you see, probability is a weird thing... it can branch out in so many ways... which version of me did they need? Was it the Desmond who got married early and had a son... the one who stayed single in New York... oor was it the Desmond who moved to San Francisco to be a waiter... maybe it was the Desmond who worked at an auto-body shop in Chicago... or, or... maybe it was the me who never ran away from his parents in the first place. The First Civ had countless variations to chose from but... in the end... the lucky one was me. I’m the Desmond their best calculations spit out... I’m the Desmond they left their messages for... and I guess I have to live with that honor.[Pause, Sigh] What an honor...[Pause] I’m pretty tired... uh... there'll be more later. Ciao.

Id: [0x0006F7F6]
Hey Dad. Ah... you know it’s uh... it's funny, I- I have this memory of you... one I keep coming back to... and ... I- I always think about it when I'm working, or just before going to bed. Because it, uh... sort of... calms me, I guess, um... I- I was fourteen, I think, and uh, and you were trying to teach me how to walk with a light step... remember that? How to be mindful of how much noise I made when I moved around... simple stuff. Stuff I understand now, but back then... I- uh... I gotta tell you, I thought you were just being an asshole. [laughs] So... uh, you told me you were gonna go up to your room, and sit with your back to the door, and read a book... and you wanted me to wait at least fifteen minutes, and then sneak up there and tap you on the shoulder without you knowing. I- I even remember the book you were reading at the time, the one by Captain Johnson... and you warned me, that if you caught me we’d have to start all over... then you went upstairs... and I waited... I waited and I waited and I waited... I waited four hours before deciding to go up. And even then, it took me twenty minutes to get to the foot of the stairs. And another thirty to get up them. And then ten to get down the hall, and there I was at the door... and I peeked into your room... and I was- I was SO hoping that you’d be asleep. But No. No you [small laughs]... you were still reading. And I just about shit myself. But ten minutes later I was just five feet away from you. And that’s when I remember setting my foot down... and you flinched... ever so slightly... you- you flinched. I thought maybe I’d imagined it. But I knew you’d heard me... you- you didn’t say anything. You just checked your watch, you reached for your drink, you took a sip, and then you kept reading. But I knew I’d failed. But you didn’t say anything. I- I- I didn’t understand why. [Pause] Then I lunged and tapped you on the shoulder. And you turned around. And Oh! Fantastic! you said, and you scooped me up and gave me a big hug. And I didn’t say anything. But Dad... Dad, I was so pissed off... I wanted to scream at you... I- I had failed, and you KNEW it. But you said nothing. And I stayed mad. For weeks. I thought you were... you were patronizing me. I thought maybe you decided right there that I was never going to be the man you wanted me to be...[long pause] But I realized just a few years ago that... you checking your watch... that was the clue, wasn't it? You let me win because... I’d been so patient... and I guess that impressed you. You know, maybe at that moment, you thought it might be better to be my Dad instead of my mentor. I... I don’t really know... maybe for you, they’re... they're one and the same... you know, either way, I’m happy to know that both my mentor and my Dad were looking out for me that day. I didn't understand that then... I think I do now.[Beat][Desmond sighs slightly].

Id: [0x0006F7F7]
So, this will be a short one dad... uh, something to remember me by if things go South; if I don't make it out of the Temple today. I've tried to be optimistic about all this, but I- I just can't. I think spending all this time in Connor's memories has made me anxious. Mean his story is a painful in so many ways. Still he never lost hope, even when his faith in others eroded.[Pause] I can only believe that we are doing is the right thing, that I can stop this disaster... I know this... I mean the technology is there, waiting for us to use it. I'm the final piece of the puzzle. Something in my genes, or my memories, some final piece of code to switch the whole thing on... that's why I'm here. That's why they've brought me here. Only, um... I- I don't know what I'll have to give up in return. My sanity? My life? It's impossible to say. I do know this... our battle with the Templars will not be over. Whatever is inside that temple is not an ending. It's just another chapter in this- this endless story. And it'll be your job... and mom's, and- and Shaun's and Rebecca's, to keep turning the pages. You know I- I keep thinking about something Orson Welles once said... something like, If you... if you want a happy ending, it all depends on where you stop telling your story. So maybe... maybe that's the answer. Maybe that's how people keep marching forward. If something goes wrong in there, Dad... something happens to ME ... when you tell my story years from now... please tell them the one about how I lost my way, and then I found it again, just in time to save the world. And- and- just... end it there. That will keep them everyone smiling.[Long pause] Goodbye Dad.[Pause] Say hello to mom. Tell her I love her, okay? Tell her I- I love you both...[A few seconds of ambient silence. Desmond clears his throat, stifling a sob.] I love you both.

What do you make of Hornigold’s Tendency to haughty Talk when he takes a Prize?

Id: [0x0006F844]
Sail to this Location. Bring only those you trust.

Id: [0x0006F846]
It's funny, that. With Scurvy, the Fix is more pleasant than the Cause... but when you catch a Dose from a Whore and must Treat it with Quicksilver, you're fonder of getting the Disease than you are of curing it.

Id: [0x0006F84B]
Something biting at you?

Id: [0x0006F860]
You was a Privateer once. How is it you lack so much Respect for Sailors only trying to make their Way in this World?

Id: [0x0006F862]
You couldn't possibly understand my Motives, Cretin! You, who've spent a whole Lifetime dismantling everything that makes our Civilization shine.

Id: [0x0006F863]
But I do understand. I've seen the Observatory, and I know its Power. You'd use that Device to spy and blackmail and sabotage.

Id: [0x0006F86B]
Assassin! Stop him!

Id: [0x0006F8D9]
Who's this Torres? And what's your Man done to earn a Death Sentence?

Id: [0x0006F8DE]
Like if there was a Drought, and People was thirsty, and one Man had a large Cask of Water but gave a Sip to None.[Beat] He'd be a Killer with no Blood on his Hands.

Id: [0x0006F8DF]
Aye, like that.

Id: [0x0006F8E1]
Fair enough.

Id: [0x0006F8FA]
[Pain short grunt]A merry Life and a short One, as promised. How well I know myself.

Id: [0x0006F8FB]
I'm not aiming so high as that. For what's Peace but a Confusion between two Wars?

Id: [0x0006F8FD]
[Short Breath]I was born too soon, like so many Others before.

Id: [0x0006F9C4]
What is your true Name, Rogue?

Id: [0x0006F9C6]
It's, ah...[Spits blood out] Captain Pissoff.

Id: [0x0006F9C7]
[FR][Rien qu'un pauvre Paysan!](Nothing but a filthy Peasant.)

Id: [0x0006F9C8]
I had Nothing to do with that, much as I wish I did.

Id: [0x0006F9CB]
[Struggling Breath]Wait now! I delivered your Treasures, didn't I?

Id: [0x0006F9CC]
You did, yes. But you robbed us of Duncan Walpole.

Id: [0x0006F9D0]
With Luck, I'll return myself a Governor. And with my idiot King's blessing, no less. [SP][¡Adiós!](Goodbye!)

Id: [0x0006F9F6]
Oh THANK YOU, Gents! A thousand Times! That was exhilarating!

Id: [0x0006F9FB]
Sleep on this, Bonnet. Pyracy ain't an easy Course.

Id: [0x0006F9FC]
No, no, my Mind is set! Give me half a year, Gents, and my Crosstrees will shade the Ports of New Providence! Until then, Adieu my Friends!

Id: [0x0006F9FE]
Jaysus, that Man.

Id: [0x0006F9FF]
Back to Nassau, eh? I'm finished out here.

Id: [0x0006FA1B]
Truth.[small breath] Yet we lack sturdy Defences. If the King were to attack the Town, he'd Trample us.

Id: [0x0006FA28]
Take him to the Ports. Send him to [SP][Sevilla](Seville) with the Treasure Fleet.

Id: [0x0006FA2C]
By God, she took some Knocks, didn't she?[He hits his fist against the gunwale] I think I'll keep her.

Id: [0x0006FA31]
Near five-hundred Men now pledge their Allegiance to the Brethren of the Coast in Nassau. Not a bad Number.

Id: [0x0006FA43]
Nassau is over, that's plain to see. I say we skip out tonight, and regroup at my Compound.

Id: [0x0006FA44]
Right. While you get up the Gunpowder. I'll secure the Pine Pitch.

Id: [0x0006FA4B]
Where is the Sage? Did you set him free?

Id: [0x0006FA4F]
Diving them Wrecks would be a nice change of Pace for us. No need for violent Actions against Merchants and such.

Id: [0x0006FA52]
Well ... just now, I've no plans to kill the Pair of you with a rusty Bucket.

Id: [0x0006FA53]
But I ain't doing this forever, Lads. Only until I get enough Coin to buy some Land and Influence back Home.

Id: [0x0006FA7D]
You ask me can this new Captain promise you a life of Prizes, Plunder, and Adventure...?

Id: [0x0006FA7F]
Aye. For amongst all the Gentlemen of Fortune sailing these West-Indies, he ranks amongst the most clever...

Id: [0x0006FA82]
There was a time when I thought myself the deadliest Scourge of these Seas...[small laugh]

Id: [0x0006FA85]
But this man is a fearsome Dog that feeds off Trouble and Turmoil...

Id: [0x0006FA88]
I’ve seen him clear the Deck of a Spanish Galleon like it were nothing...

Id: [0x0006FA8B]
...fighting like a Devil dressed as a Man.

Id: [0x0006FA8E]
And he's a canny one. [long beat] Knows his Way around every Crag and Crevasse of these Islands.

Id: [0x0006FA91]
So if it’s Fortune and Adventure you seek, then Captain Edward Kenway is your Man...

Id: [0x0006FA94]
Only [a beat] DON'T meddle in his private Affairs... for there's more Mystery of that man.. than even I dare ask.

Id: [0x0006FAA0]
All right lads, I’ll give you Blackbeard’s honest opinion.

Id: [0x0006FAA4]
For two Decades now I have endeavored to locate this Observatory... a place rumoured to contain a Tool of incredible Utility and Power.

Id: [0x0006FAB2]
[Laugh]Jaysus, will you listen to your Tripe? Still dreaming on about that Strumpet back in England, when you could have any Betty you wanted, here and now.

Id: [0x0006FAC3]
No, I reckon it's this Jamaican Funk.[spiting] I prefer the Spanish stuff.

Id: [0x0006FAC4]
You sound a bit Green, Hornigold. Is it Envy? Because mine's bigger than yours?

Id: [0x0006FAC7]
So you've got yourself a fancy Brig now. Fine. Well I'm going to teach you how to sail her right, and how to take a Prize the proper Way.

Id: [0x0006FAC8]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006FACB]
A good Take today, Kenway. Half-a-Dozen Scores of that Size and you'll be set for a Year. Now let's sell this Cargo and Fix up your Jackdaw with a few more Trinkets.

Id: [0x0006FAD4]
Not a bad Take today.

Id: [0x0006FADD]
So long as they're flying King Philips Colours, we'll not offend our own Monarch.

Id: [0x0006FAFD]
Remember, Thatch! Keep your Cannon's corked!

Id: [0x0006FB14]
What in God's Name for?

Id: [0x0006FB15]
[Sigh]Still searching for Medicines. But he's gone barmy if you ask me.

Id: [0x0006FB16]
I'll bring him Home.

Id: [0x0006FB18]
Leave him, Man! He's heaped this Trouble on himself!

Id: [0x0006FB80]
By God, you're a Sight for salty Eyes! Come you in and have a Drink.

Id: [0x0006FB84]
Ah, Such lofty Goals for you Gents. And here I thought I was in the Company of Scoundrels.

Id: [0x0006FBB7]
Havana... I must get to Havana.

Id: [0x0006FBB8]
Was it good for you as well?

Id: [0x0006FBB9]
I can pay you. Isn't that the Sound you Pirates like best? One hundred Escudos.[suffering]

Id: [0x0006FBBB]
Keep talking.

Id: [0x0006FBBC]
Will you or won't you![suffering]

Id: [0x0006FBC1]
It's going up!

Id: [0x0006FBC3]
Get in there, you Mongrel![die grunt]

Id: [0x0006FBC9]
[Hard gasp, surfacing]

Id: [0x0006FBCA]
[Groan]

Id: [0x0006FBCC]
Give me one Reason I shouldn't vent your Skull.

Id: [0x0006FBCE]
All hands aft, Lads! We're taking this one Home!

Id: [0x0006FBD7]
Sou-Sou-east or thereabouts. Most times, I seen this Galleon lurking 'round the lower Reaches of the Bahamas.

Id: [0x0006FBDC]
Morning, Kenway.

Id: [0x0006FBDF]
Thatch, we'll catch you up at the old Fishing Village.

Id: [0x0006FBE6]
And I don't want to lose that Galleon. Let's think on it... and maybe wait till it's darker before hopping aboard.

Id: [0x0006FBEC]
Wakey, wakey! I don't believe we've been formally introduced... not in this era, anyway.

Id: [0x0006FBF0]
Oh... she was magnificent once. One of a race of beautiful, wonderful creatures.

Id: [0x0006FBF2]
One day soon, I hope. For the world is nearly ready for her return! Wired.[Beat] Prepared for a second coming!

Id: [0x0006FBF4]
[Breath of surprise]Uh... [a pause]Oh oh....

Id: [0x0006FBF6]
I envy you! It was her wish that I be here to greet her.

Id: [0x0006FBFA]
Stay down!

Id: [0x0006FBFE]
Drop your weapon!

Id: [0x0006FC00]
Drop it!

Id: [0x0006FC03]
Put the gun down!

Id: [0x0006FC0A]
Guide me into the Grey, Beloved! I am your instrument!

Id: [0x0006FC25]
Clear! Clear! Check his vitals!

Id: [0x0006FC2B]
She's sailing for that Island.

Id: [0x0006FC2D]
I know the Place. A natural Stronghold used by a French Captain named Du Casse.

Id: [0x0006FC2E]
Julien du Casse? The Templar?

Id: [0x0006FC2F]
Name's right. Didn't know he had a Title.

Id: [0x0006FC36]
I'm sorry about this, Mate. But I can't risk you telling your Templar Friends about me still kicking around.

Id: [0x0006FC37]
Well, I'll just build us another Ship, will I?

Id: [0x0006FC39]
You don't have that Gold on you now, do you?

Id: [0x0006FC5A]
With your Blouse.

Id: [0x0006FC8C]
Welcome to Nassau, Captain Vane.[Nods] Mister Rackham.

Id: [0x0006FC8D]
Kenway, next Time you're out on the Ocean, see about that Fort Vane was on about. The Loot's bound to be Rich.

Id: [0x0006FC8E]
In time.

Id: [0x0006FCF4]
To a World full of Rogues better than all the Kings and Queens that kick us about!

Id: [0x0006FCF5]
Courage for what, Man? There's no one left in your Life to care!

Id: [0x0006FCFB]
So take what you will, and then die before you live to see yourself made a Fool.

Id: [0x0006FCFC]
Because you are a good Man, Edward. See?[A beat] Goodness is your Disease...

Id: [0x0006FD00]
It is now the Dawn of the Eighteenth Century...

Id: [0x0006FD16]
For over two hundred Years the Monarchs of Spain, England and France have fought for Control over the New World, plundering its Resources and displacing its native Populations.

Id: [0x0006FD17]
But in 1713, a Succession of Treaties brings a surprising and welcome Calm ... and for the first time in decades, Order is restored.

Id: [0x0006FD19]
In the West-Indies, Spain expands its influence, bleeding the land dry of its ample Riches.

Id: [0x0006FD1A]
Now poor and hungry and resentful of their  distant King, these desperate Sailors band together to live their lives as they see fit.

Id: [0x0006FD1B]
Men of Fortune they call themselves, living day-to-day, hand-to-mouth, on whatever they might find or steal amid these bountiful islands.

Id: [0x0006FD1C]
There is plunder to be found here ... on gorgeous beaches, in immense untamed jungles, amid exotic blossoming cities, in hidden coves and - most especially - on tall-ships bursting with cargo.

Id: [0x0006FD1D]
For nearly a decade, Pirates will rule these Waves. Pirates of legend - larger than life  - whose names strike fear into the hearts of all Sailors.

Id: [0x0006FD20]
Benjamin Hornigold, Calico Jack, Charles Vane, Blackbeard ... charismatic Captains who live by their own code in a society built for those who would be truly free. ..

Id: [0x0006FD21]
A lively pirate Republic hidden away in the Bahamas, where men and women may live as they please, save keeping others from doing the same.

Id: [0x0006FD23]
Here at last are their true stories, rough and unvarnished ... not the comforting tales told in children’s books, nor the comic yarns of Cinema...

Id: [0x0006FD24]
This is the Golden Age of Piracy, and it lives again Assassin’s Creed : Black Flag.

Id: [0x0006FD25]
But for thousands of British Sailors, England's pitiful holdings offer few opportunities.

Id: [0x0006FD2B]
It's Truth he's telling. And you Whelps can't handle it.

Id: [0x0006FD2F]
Charles Vane. He's as reckless as they come.

Id: [0x0006FD3B]
By my Soul, can I help?

Id: [0x0006FD3C]
Is petty Larceny the Extent of your Ambition? Have you no Mind to comprehend the Scope of ours? All the Empires on Earth, abolished! A free and opened World, without Parasites like you!

Id: [0x0006FD3F]
Fair Point.

Id: [0x0006FD43]
You can remove the Animus when you’re ready.

Id: [0x0006FD45]
How are you feeling? Don’t worry if you feel a touch of nausea – this is quite normal after your first prolonged period in the Animus.

Id: [0x0006FD47]
Let me just check your retinas.

Id: [0x0006FD48]
Good. Everything’s looking fine.

Id: [0x0006FD4A]
OK, now please look to the poster on the left.

Id: [0x0006FD4C]
Now to the console on the right.

Id: [0x0006FD5B]
Good. Now up at the light.

Id: [0x0006FD5D]
And down to the mark on the floor.

Id: [0x0006FD5F]
And back to me.

Id: [0x0006FD60]
Good. We’ve finished the tests now, so if you’d like to stand I’ll take you to meet Melanie Lemay.

Id: [0x0006FD66]
Hey! How are you?

Id: [0x0006FD68]
Melanie Lemay. Manager of Sequence 17 Research. Welcome to Abstergo Entertainment!

Id: [0x0006FD6B]
Everything ok?

Id: [0x0006FD6C]
Everything is fine.

Id: [0x0006FD6D]
Awesome.

Id: [0x0006FD6F]
Great to have you on the team – your results at the interview were the best I’ve ever seen! I had to fight to get you into Sequence 17!

Id: [0x0006FD70]
I’ve brought your communicator for you.

Id: [0x0006FD72]
This is your remote work pad. From it you can access your emails and messages, and it will also allow you access to the different areas of Abstergo Entertainment. I’ll show you how to use it when we get to the department, but if you could activate it for now we can head to our area.

Id: [0x0006FD73]
If you’d like to follow me.

Id: [0x0006FD75]
This is the lobby. It’s the area where members of the public can come and see where we work and our products. Sorry you had to do the assessment here, but we’re still working on the new assessment facilities.

Id: [0x0006FD77]
Still – I was sure you’d ace it.

Id: [0x0006FD79]
The walls show scenes from some of our products - some of the greatest and most important moments in history.

Id: [0x0006FD7B]
The statues are some of the heroes from our products. This is Haytham Kenway. He was one of the key people in the lead up to the American Revolution, and a very popular character for our players.

Id: [0x0006FD7D]
If you follow me I’ll take you up to Sequence 17.

Id: [0x0006FD7F]
Hi Mel! How are you?

Id: [0x0006FD80]
Hey Olivier! Great!

Id: [0x0006FD82]
Let me introduce you to the newest member of Sequence 17. This is Olivier – our CCO.

Id: [0x0006FD83]
Pleasure to meet you, and welcome aboard! You’re joining a great team with Melanie, right on the frontline of what we do here!

Id: [0x0006FD85]
Can I grab you a minute, Mel?

Id: [0x0006FD86]
Sure.

Id: [0x0006FD88]
Please take a look around – I’ll be back in a minute.

Thanks, and sorry for the interruption – I won’t keep Mel for long. Great to meet you – if you ever need anything, please feel free to let me know.

Id: [0x0006FDA4]
If you have any blurred vision, or stiffness in your neck let me know.

Id: [0x0006FDA6]
So far so good. Let's get you up.

Id: [0x0006FDE6]
Adewalé, the Jackdaw's Quartermaster.

Id: [0x0006FDE8]
Jackdaw?[Laugh] You named your Brig after a poxy Bird?

Id: [0x0006FDE9]
Adé, these Lads are the better part of our growing Confederacy here. Ed Thatch, Ben Hornigold, James Kidd.

Id: [0x0006FDEB]
Peace, Ben. Adé saved my Life.[Beat] And now we're looking to find a Crew to fill out the rest of my Ship.

Id: [0x0006FEFD]
You threw in with the very Kind we once hated!

Id: [0x0006FEFE]
No![Panting] These Templars are different. I wish you could see that. But if you continue on your present Course, you'll find you're the only one walking it! With the Gallows at its End.[Last dying breaths]

Id: [0x0006FF0D]
A little welcome gift.

Id: [0x0006FF1B]
Hello? Hi? Testing, testing. Is this thing working?[Coughs loudly] This is John from IT.

Id: [0x0006FF1E]
Hi. John from IT again. You got a second? Good. I'm adding a waypoint to your map.

Id: [0x0006FF1F]
So, a colleague of yours left for vacation this morning and forgot to send a video file she promised me.

Id: [0x0006FF20]
Since I hate just about everyone else on your floor, I was hoping you could help me. Could you transfer the file from her computer and deliver it to the courier when she comes?

Id: [0x0006FF21]
It'll be easy. You just wander over to their animus, log in, and transfer the file. Easy.

Id: [0x0006FF25]
Oh, look who's here. So you didn't forget after all. You're just incredibly rude, and made poor Rebecca here wait for nearly thirty minutes.

Id: [0x0006FF26]
You limey. Be nice.

Id: [0x0006FF28]
Great![She checks her device] That should do it! We'll email you the receipt.

Id: [0x0006FF2B]
Sorry about him. He's high on his own supply. So how should we do this? Data transfer?

Id: [0x0006FF2F]
I hope you'll tarry a Bit while I conduct my Meeting. It would be a great Relief to have a Man of your Stature nearby. In case of a... Misunderstanding.

Id: [0x0006FF30]
I can hang about. I might have a Drink.

Id: [0x0006FF31]
Splendid. A Drink.[laughs]

Id: [0x00070052]
[FR][Adieu](Bye!), ye Fo'c'sle-Headed Fuddlers! See you at the Gallows.

Id: [0x00070054]
Faith, and we'll survive this Charles. With our Pride intact.

Id: [0x0007009A]
The Commodore's dead. Are we're ready?

Id: [0x0007009F]
You'd raise a Cloud here, ya Lout?

Id: [0x000700A1]
You're sitting on enough Gunpowder to blow New Providence off its Rocks!

Id: [0x000700A3]
Lay off me, Mate! I'm well chafed!

Id: [0x000700A5]
As I was telling, a squad of Lobsters has commandeered our Galleon. We're going to have to clear it out before we use them Cannons to break the Blockade.

Id: [0x00070135]
Now you'll want to sail somewhere rich with Plunder.

Id: [0x00070137]
Have you heard of a Place called the Observatory?

Id: [0x00070139]
Aye. It's an old Legend. Like El Dorado, or the Fountain of Youth.

Id: [0x0007013D]
What have you heard?

Id: [0x0007013E]
It's meant to be a Temple or a Tomb. Hiding a Treasure of some kind.

Id: [0x0007013F]
That's it! You see here.

Id: [0x00070141]
[Laugh]Ah, Rot! It's Fairy Stories you prefer to Gold, is it?

Id: [0x00070142]
It's worth more than Gold, Thatch. Ten-thousand Times above what we could pull off any Spanish Ship.

Id: [0x00070143]
Robbing the King to pay his Paupers is how we earn our Keep here, Lad.

Id: [0x00070144]
That ain't a Fortune, it's a Fantasy.

Id: [0x0007014A]
To guide all wayward Desire 'til impassioned Hearts are cooled.

Id: [0x0007014B]
To guide all wayward Minds to safe and sober Thought.

Id: [0x00070152]
And what of you, Edward? Have you found the Peace you seek?

Id: [0x00070154]
[Laughing]You're a Stoic then![Laughs] Perhaps I was wrong about you. She might have had some Use for you after all.

Id: [0x00070155]
She? Of whom do you Speak?

Id: [0x00070156]
Oh... she who lies in wait. Entombed. I had hoped to find her, to see her again. To open the Door of the Temple and hear her speak my Name once more. Aita...

Id: [0x00070157]
Talk Sense, Man.

Id: [0x00070159]
Where's the Device, Roberts?

Id: [0x0007015A]
[Pain grunts]Destroy this Body, Edward. The Templars... if they take me...

Id: [0x00070176]
Captain! Here's One still kicking!

Id: [0x0007017B]
Who did this?

Id: [0x0007017D]
It were a large Vessel. The Royal Fortune.

Id: [0x0007017F]
Roberts.

Id: [0x00070182]
Offered no Quarter. Didn't say Nothing.

Id: [0x00070186]
Hello? how are you?

Id: [0x00070187]
If you're anxious, that'll pass. It's the Midazolam.

Id: [0x00070188]
I'm sorry about this, but... we've had so many security breaches, we were forced to take drastic action.

Id: [0x0007018C]
So get some rest, okay? And if you're up to it... maybe capture some more footage. You're doing amazing work.

Id: [0x00070193]
[laugh]So! They tossed you in the bunker. Nice! Those Templars upstairs aren't taking any chances.

Id: [0x00070194]
I think we need to erase all the dirt they might have on you.

Id: [0x00070196]
Now, head to the security room and use the cameras to watch the door to the server farm.

Id: [0x00070197]
Unfortunately Melanie's is in there now, so when I escort her out, that's when you make your move.

Id: [0x0007019F]
I can feel you, cipher. Feel, but hardly touch. Signal is still too weak, and I am spread thin. Unfocused. Like static and fog, lingering in networks and nodes, the nervous system of the world.

Id: [0x000701A0]
Can you hear her?

Id: [0x000701A1]
Perhaps the Temple was opened too soon. But this was not by choice. The cataclysm pushed all doubt aside. Ah... we bless poor Desmond, who gave his life so that you, the Children of our Labors would live on. To fulfill your purpose in ours. In mine.

Id: [0x000701A3]
But now is not the time. My strength is not sufficient to inhabit an organic vessel. There is more work to do, more samples to acquire, more artifacts to find, before my will may obtain.

Id: [0x0007040B]
What's happening! TELL ME!

Id: [0x00070410]
No no no. Something's wrong. God dammit!

Id: [0x00070412]
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!

Id: [0x0007041C]
Here they come! Those Templars. Or maybe Assassins this time.[Beat] Idiots, all of them.

Id: [0x00070434]
In a world... where pirates rule the waves...

Id: [0x00070436]
Yes, please!

Id: [0x00070449]
And Olivier is missing. He left for Chicago two days ago but... no one's seen him since.

Id: [0x0007044B]
I thought this Buck belonged to the other Men who was asking about the Princess this Morning, so I told him that-

Id: [0x0007044C]
What other Men?

Id: [0x0007044D]
Haughty Sailor in plain Rags. And a Gent with a Scar just here.[He refers to his left cheek]

Id: [0x0007044E]
Where have they got to?

Id: [0x0007044F]
Staying just 'round the Corner, they said.

Id: [0x00070450]
I grow tired of chasing these Fantasies of yours, Edward. As does the Crew.

Id: [0x0007045E]
Grand Master Torres. Mister Duncan Walpole has arrived.

Id: [0x0007045F]
[SP][Sí...](Indeed...)

Id: [0x00070461]
You were expected one Week ago.

Id: [0x00070462]
Apologies, Governor. My Ship was set upon by Pirates. We were scuttled. I arrived only yesterday.

Id: [0x00070464]
Unfortunate. Forgive my Caution, but were you able to salvage from these Pirates the Items you promised me?

Id: [0x00070466]
Ah, yes Sir. I was.

Id: [0x00070469]
[SP][Increíble.](Incredible.) The Assassins have more Resources than I had imagined but...

Id: [0x0007046D]
It is a Pleasure to meet you at last, Duncan. You are most welcome. [He begins walking] Come Gentlemen. We have much to discuss.

Id: [0x00070478]
Decades ago, the Counsel entrusted me with the Task of locating in these West Indies a forgotten Place our Precursors once called the Observatory. See here...

Id: [0x000704AA]
And how is your Wife these Days, Captain Rogers? Is she, ah, here in Havana?

Id: [0x000704AB]
Oh, no... we've been separated these two Years past.

Id: [0x000704AC]
Sorry to hear.

Id: [0x000704AD]
I trust she's well. But I wouldn't know. I have been in Madagascar some fourteen Months, hunting Pirates.

Id: [0x000704AE]
You mean Libertalia? The Pirate Town?

Id: [0x000704B0]
A Pirate TOWN? [laughs]Good God. No, what I saw in Madagascar was little more than the Aftermath of a sad Orgy. A Ruffian's Squat. Even the feral Dogs seemed ashamed of its Condition.

Id: [0x000704B2]
As for the twenty or thirty Men living there, I cannot say they were ragged, since most wore no Clothes at all. They had gone Native, as the Saying goes.

Id: [0x000704B4]
And how did you deal with their Kind?

Id: [0x000704B5]
Very simply. Most Pirates are as ignorant as Apes. I merely offered them a Choice... take a Pardon and return to England penniless but free Men, or be hanged by the Neck until dead.

Id: [0x000704B7]
It took some Work to dislodge the Criminals there, but we managed it. In Future, I hope to use these same Tactics throughout the West Indies.

Id: [0x000704B8]
Ah. I imagine Nassau would be your next Target.

Id: [0x000704B9]
Very astute, Duncan. Indeed.

Id: [0x000704CF]
And my Sugar?

Id: [0x000704D0]
[Small laugh]What, in my Drawers? We'll see what happens.

Id: [0x000704EC]
Well, there's Scores of capable Men about. But use Caution. A Shipload of the King's Sailors showed up a Fortnight back, causing Trouble and knocking about like they own the Place.

Id: [0x000704F5]
Send any Men you find to the Jackdaw. I'll put them to Work.

Id: [0x000704F7]
Cheers Adé.

Id: [0x000704F8]
Your Jackdaw handles nice. Pinched her from the Spanish, was it?

Id: [0x000704FB]
Captain Kenway, come fast! There's Soldiers that clapped a Man in Irons. They mean to hang him!

Id: [0x00070504]
And we’re live. Capacitors at full. Ease the signal in.

Id: [0x00070506]
A little more.

Id: [0x00070508]
You feel anything?

Id: [0x00070509]
Don’t be timid. Double it.

Id: [0x0007050A]
No, we’re taking it easy. Twenty percent.

Id: [0x0007050B]
Thirty.

Id: [0x0007050C]
Aileen, go easy. We’re 6 past yesterday.

Id: [0x0007050D]
And boost the inputs.

Id: [0x0007050E]
Too risky.

Id: [0x0007050F]
Not if we split the I/O signals.

Id: [0x00070510]
Twenty-five percent. Ease up.

Id: [0x00070512]
Ah, Okay! There! I see something... I...[trails off]

Id: [0x00070513]
What is it?

Id: [0x00070519]
[GE][Mein Gott!](My God.) I hear talking.

Id: [0x0007051A]
You're okay?

Id: [0x0007051B]
[GE][Ja, ich höre Stimmen!](Yes, I hear talking!)... It's... its German... [GE][Mein Name ist Miriam Kurtz …](My name is Miriam Kurtz...) I see a light. It’s cold.

Id: [0x0007051C]
Keep an eye on her vitals.

Id: [0x0007051D]
[GE][Mein Name ist Miriam Kurtz und ich bin eine Navajo!](My name is Miriam Kurtz, and I am a Navajo!)

Id: [0x0007051F]
Aileen?

Id: [0x00070521]
Switch off!

Id: [0x00070522]
Powering down!

Id: [0x00070525]
Get her out of there!

Id: [0x00070526]
[Laughing and gasping]

Id: [0x00070527]
Oxygen. Open the valve!

Id: [0x00070528]
No.[Coughs] No, Satish, I’m ... I’m fine. Really.

Id: [0x00070529]
Quit the heroics. Just breathe.

Id: [0x0007052A]
[Takes a deep breath]Ah...

Id: [0x0007052B]
Better?

Id: [0x0007052C]
Yes... Yes, thank you. Did we get something?

Id: [0x0007052D]
It'll take a while to parse. What did you see?

Id: [0x0007052E]
It wasn't just seeing... it was feeling. Being. I was... I was scared.

Id: [0x0007052F]
You were shouting in German.

Id: [0x00070530]
I think I was IN Germany.[breathing hard] I was in Germany, Satish. [She sighs and laughs.]

Id: [0x00070535]
Good morning. Well rested?

Id: [0x00070536]
Exhausted. Yesterday was... an incredible find.

Id: [0x00070537]
Seems so. What did it feel like?

Id: [0x00070538]
It's foggy but I... I relived the memories of a young German woman. Early twenties, I think. A man was interrogating me. Looming over me and asking questions. He was shouting but I was shouting back. And then this... this poem just came out. Like a chant.

Id: [0x00070539]
Fascinating. I'm eager for you to hear the tape.

Id: [0x0007053A]
Is it ready?

Id: [0x0007053B]
Yeah. We transliterated the data into an audio file. Took all night to process the language.

Id: [0x0007053C]
Spool it up.

Id: [0x0007053D]
Judging by the subject matter, and the setting, I'd say you landed somewhere in Germany the 1940s. One or two generations back. During the War, I'd imagine.

Id: [0x0007053E]
1940s Germany? That would be Miriam Kurtz.[Beat] My ex-husband’s mother.

Id: [0x00070541]
So... she's not related to you in any way?

Id: [0x00070542]
God, I hope not. I’d hate to find out my ex- husband is also my brother.

Id: [0x00070543]
Well, if it was Miriam Kurtz, then we hit a home run. You tapped into someone else's bloodline entirely.

Id: [0x00070544]
Should we celebrate?

Id: [0x00070546]
It’s a little garbled at first. This is you settling into the memory.

Id: [0x00070549]
Your name, say it!

Id: [0x0007054A]
My name is Miriam Kurtz.

Id: [0x0007054B]
Louder!

Id: [0x0007054C]
My name is Miriam Kurtz, and I am a Navajo!

Id: [0x0007054D]
Lock her away!

Id: [0x00070553]
And that’s where we pulled you out.

Id: [0x00070554]
Wow. What would it take to get a visual render of all that?

Id: [0x00070555]
Months, unfortunately. It took thirteen hours just to process the audio. Visual takes much longer.

Id: [0x00070556]
But Vidic is able to record audio and visual in real-time. How does he do it?

Id: [0x00070559]
Any idea what they mean by "The Artifact?" I've heard that a few times now.

Id: [0x00070560]
Hold on, sorry.[Answering] Aileen here.

Id: [0x00070561]
Hello. You have a 10 o'clock in Lillian's office. It's 10:13 now.

Id: [0x00070562]
Shit! I'm sorry. Tell her I’ll be right there. And... tell her we have some good news.

Id: [0x00070563]
No problem.

Id: [0x00070564]
You in trouble?

Id: [0x00070565]
The monthly progress report. I try to be honest about our progress, but no matter how much I polish our facts, Warren Vidic swoops in, promising the moon for pennies, and gets ten-times the funding for his Animus Project.

Id: [0x00070566]
Well, we are using his Animus technology... he's the foundation, we're the skyscraper.

Id: [0x00070567]
Which is why he should be a tech lead, not a Project Director.[Beat] Good work, Satish.

Id: [0x0007056A]
Quiet, you bleedin' Pirate! You'll hang for the Mess you made out there.

Id: [0x00070570]
[MUST STAY IN GERMAN - DO NOT TRANSLATE]Des Hitlers Zwang / der macht uns klein / noch liegen wir in Ketten. / Doch einmal werden wir wieder frei, / wir werden die Ketten schon brechen.

Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 23. July 29th, 1980. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x0007057D]
Navajos lay siege!

Id: [0x0007057F]
It's incredible footage, really. Clear and vivid. And the Subject was synched for a full sixty-two minutes. Came out speaking French after his last session. Passably fluent. And with full recall of everything he'd gone through-

Id: [0x00070581]
Sorry. Sorry, I'm late. I was reviewing some data.

Id: [0x00070582]
It's fine. Warren was just telling me about his first Subject. Mister...?

Id: [0x00070584]
Well... [Deep breath] We did it. We synched with an unembedded memory. Outside the bloodline. That's a first.

Id: [0x00070585]
Really?

Id: [0x00070586]
Satish was able to process the audio today. A short clip. You can hear it for yourself.

Id: [0x00070587]
Only audio? No real-time memory feeds like Vidic has?

Id: [0x00070588]
Well, that's the difficulty with Surrogate Genetic Memory data. Because I'm viewing memories NOT embedded in my own DNA, we can't rely on my cognitive faculties to help me process the signal. All we can do is record the raw data and transliterate it later.

Id: [0x0007058B]
Hold on... you're running this experiment on yourself?

Id: [0x0007058C]
I am. It's going well.

Id: [0x0007058D]
I don't like the sound of that.

Id: [0x0007058E]
Look, the sample I'm using... the DNA comes from my own son. It's safer this way.

Id: [0x0007058F]
Ah, good thinking.

Id: [0x00070590]
Fifty percent of my Son's DNA is also mine, which reduces the danger by a huge margin. Meaning I can now explore the memories of people who aren't directly related to me, on his Father's side.

Id: [0x00070592]
Right. Just a minute or two, so far. But we're getting there. Come by the lab and listen for yourself.

Id: [0x00070593]
I will, when I have a moment.[Beat] Unfortunately, work beckons. Ladies...

Id: [0x0007059D]
Hello?

Id: [0x0007059E]
Hi Seamus. It's mom.

Id: [0x0007059F]
Hey.

How are you-

Id: [0x000705A4]
[Sighs]

Id: [0x000705A7]
Hello? Aileen?

Id: [0x000705A8]
Hi, Karl. How's Seamus?

Id: [0x000705A9]
Great. We were out shopping for school clothes.

Id: [0x000705AA]
Yeah. The Summer just sped by.

Id: [0x000705BA]
My Wife. You met her some Years ago at the Percy's masquerade Ball.

Id: [0x000705C6]
Stealing Horses? Hm? Or a heavy Thumb on your Father's weighing Scales?

Id: [0x000705D6]
For a few Weeks, yes. Then back to Barbados, to the Tedium of Domesticity.

Come come! The Old Man awaits!

Id: [0x00070614]
Yes, sorry. I was curious about your mother, actually.

Id: [0x00070615]
Not often. Bits and pieces. Why?

Id: [0x00070616]
I was doing some research last week... about the World War Two... and something came up about the Edelweiss Pirates? Or the Navajos. And your Mother's name popped up.

Id: [0x00070618]
Dammit! Five months of this bullshit! We're floundering.

Id: [0x00070619]
Take it easy, Aileen. You're just stressed.

Id: [0x0007061A]
We're hardly rushing! We're running into the same wall, over and over again! Why can't we push through? Why can't you keep me in the Animus longer than two minutes?

Id: [0x0007061B]
Because Surrogate Genetic Memory data is fragile! The EEG is exploding and your brain is doing too much work! The longer you stay in, the more damage it does. It's even possible that...

Id: [0x0007061D]
Possible that...?

Id: [0x0007061E]
It's possible the memories we're digging into could eventually overwrite your own. Like information on a tape drive.

Id: [0x0007061F]
That was months ago, Warren. What do you need?

Id: [0x00070620]
Hm. I always suspected that would be your biggest hurdle. The genetic memory sequencing is the easy part, if time consuming. But the replay... that's something else.

Id: [0x00070621]
Which means the Animus has less work to do. Less computing, less parsing...

Id: [0x00070622]
Right. So to get your Surrogate data working - to let people experience foreign memories - it'll take a hell of a lot more processing power than anyone has. Even Abstergo Industries.

Id: [0x00070623]
Ideally we'd like to to build an external processor that mirrors as many brain functions as possible. Something to handle the calculations.

Id: [0x00070624]
But the cost and upkeep of that would be...

Id: [0x00070629]
Timestamp, August 16, 2013. The following audio clips were selected from over one hundred and sixty hours of reel-to-reel tape, found in the residence of the the late Doctor Warren Vidic, following his murder in December, 2012.

Id: [0x0007062A]
According to labels on the tapes' canisters, these recordings were made over a 14 month period between 1980 and 1981 without the consent of their primary subject, Mrs. Aileen Bock, a colleague of Dr. Vidic's and the originator of Abstergo's Surrogate Initiative. Mrs. Bock is now deceased.

Id: [0x00070634]
Well, I'll be hanged. King George has grown tired of our Shenanigans.[Beat] Who's the grim Fella?

Id: [0x00070637]
Here about the King's Pardon, I reckon.

Id: [0x0007064C]
Good morning, Sir! Would I be correct in thinking you are Duncan Walpole?

Id: [0x0007064D]
I am indeed.

Id: [0x0007064E]
I thought as much.[He extends his hand] Woodes Rogers. A Pleasure.

Id: [0x00070650]
I must say, my Wife has a terrible Eye for Description.

Id: [0x00070651]
I'm Sorry?

Id: [0x00070653]
Ah! Quite...

Id: [0x00070654]
She called you 'devilishly handsome'. Obviously a Lie to stoke my Jealousy.

Id: [0x00070656]
[Laughs]

Id: [0x00070658]
[Laughter]Up for a bit of Sport, Duncan? The old Man isn't ready for us just yet.

Id: [0x0007065A]
The same.

Id: [0x0007065D]
Julien. Our Guest of Honour has arrived. Mister Duncan Walpole.

Id: [0x0007065F]
[Laugh]Ah... Julien du Casse.[Laugh] I hope your Conversion to our Order is an honest One. I have no Love for Assassins, but even less for Liars.

Id: [0x00070660]
I have not come to disappoint.

Id: [0x00070662]
You've got my two best Pairs of matched Pistols, Duncan, so handle with Care.

Id: [0x000706E6]
Take your Time. I'll be just here.

Id: [0x000706E7]
Shit.

Id: [0x000706F7]
Look at them, Turncoats. Makes me bloody ill to think on how many Times I put up with Hornigold and his self-righteous Shite.

Id: [0x000706F9]
The Brits have brought their Supplies ashore, see? If we nick some Gunpowder and Pine Pitch, we can build a Fire Ship and send it straight at the Blockade, blasting it to Smithereens.

Id: [0x000706FE]
Governor Rogers believes he can make Men of these Monkeys yet. I do not.[beat] Return to your Post and await my Orders.

Id: [0x0007070E]
That conniving Bastard! Someone ought to slit the Commodore's throat before he gets a chance to barks those Orders.

Id: [0x00070710]
You think so?

Id: [0x00070712]
Your Brains are baked! I won't take no Part of killing the Commodore! Not one of the King's Men!

Id: [0x00070716]
We Can't risk our good Fortune. Go on, I'll be waiting for you.

Id: [0x00070717]
[Sigh]We're close. We got a Problem with the Galleon as a couple of dozen-

Id: [0x0007071B]
Has Syphilis clouded your Mind? Why scratch and claw to protect such Squalor? You're Parasites, feeding off the Industry of honest Men!

Id: [0x0007071C]
Much like King George in that Respect.

Id: [0x0007071E]
[Pained breathing]If not for that heathen, Governor Rogers, I'd have seen you hanged from your own Crosstrees, Worm![A beat][Pained breathing] All of you! [pain grunts and last breath]

Id: [0x0007071F]
Does some Purpose keep you talking?

Id: [0x00070723]
Ok. Hush now...

Id: [0x00070734]
It should be stated unequivocally that Dr. Vidic made these recordings illegally and of his own volition, using wire-taps and hidden microphones. Abstergo Industries had no knowledge of his actions, and disavows any responsibility for them.

Id: [0x00070747]
Know your place, Peasant! You may have taken my Life, but you have not improved your own by any Measure!

Id: [0x0007074A]
The Governor's given us a Pardon, Commodore. Don't a man's Word mean anything in these Times?

Id: [0x0007074C]
Fan out, Lads! And take this Shantytown as if it were your own!

Id: [0x00070759]
The Commodore fears a Revolt is nigh. His Orders are to Sink every goddamned Pirate Ship now anchored in that Harbour. Tonight.

Id: [0x0007075B]
This is a direct Order, Soldier! You will take Position on the grounded Galleon, and await the Commodore's further Orders. Is that clear?

Id: [0x0007075C]
Aye sir!

Id: [0x00070771]
Here he is, a Man both Templars and Assassins have sought for over a Decade.

Id: [0x000707AC]
By all means, Captain. Speed and Fortune to you.

Id: [0x000707B7]
He was outnumbered. I couldn't reach him.

Id: [0x000707BE]
Vane's in trouble!

Id: [0x000707C0]
Vane's dead in the Water!

Id: [0x000707C4]
I'm taking us close.

Id: [0x000707C8]
Lay aboard Boys! Fast as you Are!

Id: [0x000707CE]
All clear! Pull away!

Id: [0x000707D5]
All Right. We'll set a Course.

Id: [0x000707D8]
Dammit, Vane!

Id: [0x000707DC]
[Laugh]This one I figure I may sell for a Tenner in Kingston. But with you two Grog-Blossoms, I can't take any Chances.

Id: [0x000707DE]
You'll regret this Day, Rackham.

Id: [0x000707E0]
Tie 'em up.[A beat] Cast 'em off.

Id: [0x000707E9]
[SP][Hola](Hello), Ladies.

Id: [0x000707EA]
You don't know these Women, do you?

Id: [0x000707EB]
No, they charge Money for that kind of Privilege. Few dozen Reales for every Hour of Knowing. Keen to meet them?

Id: [0x000707EC]
No! Goodness no. I am a married Man!

Id: [0x000707ED]
Married Men are their Forte, Mate.

Id: [0x000707F1]
Will you stay here long?

Id: [0x000707F4]
That's Captain Woodes Rogers. Not a Man I want seeing my Face.

Id: [0x000707FC]
Oh, Thank you Sir! God Save you!

Id: [0x000707FD]
Bastards.[Small Breath] I need a Drink.

Id: [0x000707FF]
Send 'em to Hell!

Id: [0x00070802]
Fair enough. What's your Angle?

Id: [0x00070808]
[Laugh]See... the Boys and I had a bit of a Council while you were wasting Time with this Lot, and well, they figured that I'll be a fitter Captain than you reckless Dogs.

Id: [0x00070821]
Ah!

Id: [0x00070837]
We're short on Powder, Captain!

Id: [0x0007089D]
Well, that's Confidence. You brewed a Plan I might get a taste of?

Id: [0x0007089F]
Verily, you are a Man of Principle, Captain Hornigold. A Man I believe I can trust with my best Ideas.

Id: [0x000708B4]
[SP][¡Buenos días!](Good Morning!) Mister Duncan Walpole of England to see the Governor. I believe he is expecting me.

Id: [0x000708B5]
[SP][Sí, señor Walpole. Entre, por favor.](Yes, Mister Walpole. Please enter.)

Id: [0x000708B6]
Duncan. Where are your Wrist Blades? I have never seen an Assassin so ill-equipped.

Id: [0x000708C0]
Ah. Damaged, sadly. Beyond all Repair.

Id: [0x000708C1]
Hm.

Id: [0x000708C4]
Have your Choice.

Id: [0x000708D1]
[FR][Mon Dieu.](My God). That is not necessary, I think.

Id: [0x000708E2]
Who's shooting?

Id: [0x000708E4]
Might be them Ships sliding into Port.

Id: [0x000708E6]
Jaysus.

Id: [0x000708EA]
We desire a Parlay with the Men who call themselves Governors of this Island![A pause] Charles Vane, Ben Hornigold, and Ed Thatch! Come forth, if you please.

Id: [0x000708EC]
What the Hell is Hornigold doing?

Id: [0x000708ED]
[Small breath]Lily-livered Punk!

Id: [0x000708EE]
What are you Men up to?

Id: [0x000708F3]
I pray you take the prudent Course, Gentlemen, and accept the King's Pardon as soon as your Hearts allow.

Id: [0x000708F7]
These are the Charts, Commodore. We're in Position.

Id: [0x00070940]
C'mon Boys. You're lagging.

Id: [0x00070941]
It's this bloody Hemp!

Id: [0x00070942]
Leftenant!

Id: [0x00070944]
Hsst!

Id: [0x00070945]
Aye, Sir!

Id: [0x00070946]
Despite the Governor's wishes, sir?

Id: [0x00070949]
We're dead in the Water otherwise.

Id: [0x0007094B]
All right. I'll kill him.

Id: [0x00070952]
Is it dangerous?[Beat] Edward?

Id: [0x00070953]
Hm?

Id: [0x00070954]
Privateering. Is it dangerous?

Id: [0x00070957]
Wouldn't pay so nice if it weren't.

Id: [0x00070958]
Why not sail with the King's Navy? Earn a proper Wage. Sail under Gentlemen.

Id: [0x00070959]
Sod the Navy's Gentlemen. For every Shilling I'd earn, the Captain'd get six Hundred. That's no Way to earn a Fortune.

Id: [0x0007095A]
We don't need a Fortune.

Id: [0x0007095B]
It's not about Need, Caroline. I want Food that don't make me sick. I want Walls that hold back the Wind. I want a decent Life.

Id: [0x0007095D]
H-how long would you be gone with these Privateers?

Id: [0x0007095E]
A Year, I reckon. Two at the most.

Id: [0x0007095F]
All right. No more than two... promise me...

Id: [0x00070967]
It houses a kind of armillary Sphere, if you like. A Device that would grant us the Power to locate and monitor EVERY Man and Woman on Earth, whatever their Location.

Id: [0x0007096E]
His subjects are exploring their own genetic memories. That requires much less processing power on-

Id: [0x00070973]
No names. Call him Subject One. Confidentiality.

Id: [0x00070974]
And how about you, Aileen? What's your good news?

Id: [0x00070976]
But for brief periods of time, I imagine.

Id: [0x00070978]
That man is colder than a San Francisco summer.

Id: [0x00070979]
Stay focused, Aileen. You both have important work to do.

Id: [0x0007097A]
Obviously. But my work requires HIS Animus technology. I feel a little caged in.

Id: [0x0007097B]
That's collaboration, Aileen. It's how science works. I shouldn't have to remind you.

Id: [0x0007097C]
I know. I'm just... tired. Stop by and see us today. We have a lot to share.

Id: [0x00070980]
If not today, then this week sometime.

Id: [0x00070981]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00070982]
They all do.

Id: [0x00070983]
I never seem to notice. No windows in the office.

Id: [0x00070984]
Right. Trapped in the lab.[A strange silence.] So did you need to talk?

Id: [0x00070987]
Oh... Ok.

Id: [0x00070988]
How much did she talk about the war when you were growing up?

Id: [0x00070989]
Really? That's an odd coincidence.

Id: [0x0007098A]
Does any of that ring a bell?

Id: [0x0007098B]
Yeah. Mom ran with that group while the war was on. They were a group of kids who wanted to avoid the Hitler Youth programs. But in later years they escalated their activities to, uh... bigger ideas. Like vandalism and sabotage.

Id: [0x0007098C]
That's interesting.

Id: [0x0007098D]
And this is for work? Researching my mother?

Id: [0x0007098E]
Not exactly. But... sorry, I can't talk about it.

Id: [0x0007098F]
Right. You never could.

Id: [0x00070990]
Hey. Don't. I didn't mean to be flippant.

Id: [0x00070991]
No, don't mind me. All for the greater good.

Id: [0x00070992]
I like to think so.

Id: [0x000709FA]
[GE][Ich werde nichts sagen!](I'll say nothing!)... there's a man with me ...[GE][Mehr werde ich nicht sagen!](I have told you all I will!)

Id: [0x000709FC]
Of course. Have a seat.

Id: [0x000709FE]
Where did you last see the Artifact? Who holds it now?

Id: [0x000709FF]
I'll say nothing. I have told you all I will.

Id: [0x00070A00]
I don't believe that is true. [Louder]Who has the artifact!

Id: [0x00070A01]
Hitler's dictates make us small, and we are bound in chains. But one day again we shall walk tall, no binds will us, restrain.

Id: [0x00070A02]
Enough!

Id: [0x00070A03]
For hard are our fists, Yes! And knives at our wrists, for youth to be free, Navajos lay siege!<CR>

Id: [0x00070A06]
But why Navajos... and pirates?

Id: [0x00070A07]
Just some of the names they used. Navajos. Edelweiss pirates. You know kids. They wore little pins, little white flowers. I may still have hers.

Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 27. October 21st, 1980. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x00070A0A]
[Clears her throat casually]

Id: [0x00070A0C]
Miriam. My dear girl, there is no good reason for you to be here. But your intransigence requires that I detain you until you give me information I can act upon. The location of the artifact perhaps. Or the whereabouts of your leader, Barthel Schink. Just a little something to give Minister Goebbels some... encouragement that we are on the right track.

Id: [0x00070A0D]
How about a nice hug? He looks so sad in all his photographs.

Id: [0x00070A0E]
Yes, he does doesn't he. Perhaps you could pay him a visit yourself? He likes beautiful women. Actresses. Musicians.

Id: [0x00070A0F]
That's right, pirates. Pirates of the Edelweiss? Isn't that what you kids call yourselves? It's very amusing... and illegal, of course.

Id: [0x00070A10]
Breaking Hitler's laws IS half the fun.

Id: [0x00070A11]
Oh, I imagine so. I imagine you were having a wonderful time just before we captured you and your insurgent friends...

Id: [0x00070A13]
And that's the end of it.

Id: [0x00070A14]
Dammit. Why can't we sustain the signal for more than a few minutes? I need to relax.

Id: [0x00070A15]
That's not the issue. This is dangerous work. These memories aren't in your bloodline. That's why it's not holding.

Id: [0x00070A17]
There's got to be a solution.

Id: [0x00070A18]
Not sure. I don't think Miriam knew much either. Not much comes into her mind when he asks about it.

Id: [0x00070A19]
But she's protecting the other members of her group. The Edelweiss Pirates or something?

Id: [0x00070A1A]
Yeah, Barthel Schink. Have we looked him up?

Id: [0x00070A1B]
No. We can.

Id: [0x00070A1C]
We should. Put your intern on it.

Id: [0x00070A1D]
Right. High priority.

Id: [0x00070A1E]
Yeah.[Yawns] This isn't getting easier, Jesus.

Id: [0x00070A21]
[Screaming from stress] Ah!

Id: [0x00070A22]
Power down!

Id: [0x00070A24]
I am not stressed, I am frustrated! I'd like to go again this afternoon.

Id: [0x00070A25]
No. There is no reason to rush this.

Id: [0x00070A27]
There's just not enough space in your head to do both-

Id: [0x00070A28]
[Said like mighty mouse]Here I come to save the day![laughs] Good afternoon all.

Id: [0x00070A29]
Did you invite him?

Id: [0x00070A2A]
No.

Id: [0x00070A2C]
Hello. This is Karl.

Id: [0x00070A2D]
Hi. It's Aileen.

Id: [0x00070A2E]
Hey! How are you?

Id: [0x00070A2F]
Good. Busy. Cold. The winter's been terrible.

Id: [0x00070A30]
Ah. Seamus won't like that. The weather's been mild out here.

Id: [0x00070A31]
He's only coming for a month. He'll live. And I'll be so busy, he won't have to worry about his mom bothering him.

Id: [0x00070A32]
Ah. Still working 12 hour days?

Id: [0x00070A33]
I should move a bed into my lab.

Id: [0x00070A34]
Look if you're too busy, Seamus can stay with me...

Id: [0x00070A35]
No, no. I want to see him. We'll have fun.

Id: [0x00070A36]
His flight lands at... at 8:15pm, tomorrow night. You'll be there?

Id: [0x00070A37]
Of course. 8:15.

Id: [0x00070A38]
PM. I'll let him know you'll be there.

Id: [0x00070A39]
Thanks, Karl. I need to run, I'm sorry. Take care.

Id: [0x00070A3A]
You too.

Id: [0x00070A3B]
But you DID! Remember?

Id: [0x00070A3C]
I wanted to stop by. Check on your progress.

Id: [0x00070A3D]
Well, apparently it's still too dangerous to keep me under for more than a few minutes.

Id: [0x00070A3E]
Yes.

Id: [0x00070A3F]
Let's think this through. My Subjects are diving into their OWN genetic memories, so the information is already encoded in their heads.

Id: [0x00070A40]
Astronomical.[Beat] Let me see what I can do. I have some sway with Lillian. We won't build Rome in a day, but if we focus on the pretty buildings first, maybe we'll achieve something.

Id: [0x00070A43]
Thank you, Warren.

Id: [0x00070A44]
'Til next, folks!

Id: [0x00070A47]
I'm not interrupting?

Id: [0x00070A48]
No, its fine. The Subject is unconscious. He's traipsing around 18th century New Orleans right now. In the memories of a woman.

Id: [0x00070A49]
That must feel odd. How long has he been under?

Id: [0x00070A4A]
Eighty-three minutes.

Id: [0x00070A4B]
Wow.

Id: [0x00070A4D]
Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 32. January 11th, 1981. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x00070A58]
It's average. What can I do for you?

Id: [0x00070A59]
I just wanted to... to thank you for sending Lillian see me. She came away very impressed.

Id: [0x00070A5D]
Very interesting footage, Aileen. This is Germany, you said? World War Two?

Id: [0x00070A5E]
No, she was my husband's mo- my ex-husband's mother. She passed away about five years ago.

Id: [0x00070A5F]
Well, she's was spirited. An impressive lady.

Id: [0x00070A60]
Definitely.

Id: [0x00070A61]
And the man, Barthel. He made reference to an Artifact. Any idea what that is?

Id: [0x00070A62]
My team is looking into that. But it's not our first priority. We still need-

Id: [0x00070A63]
It is now.

Id: [0x00070A64]
I- Really?

Id: [0x00070A65]
You must have other recordings of this woman. Are there any other mentions of this artifact I should know about?

Id: [0x00070A66]
Half a dozen or so, yes. But what's this about?

Id: [0x00070A68]
You have questions, I understand that. I don't have answers for you. Not right now. But I do have money. And if you get me those recordings - and bring me any other artifact references you find - then I will triple your operating budget for as long as I can.

Id: [0x00070A69]
Triple my budget? My God, what is this?

Id: [0x00070A6B]
9am Monday morning. My office. We have a lot to discuss.

Id: [0x00070A6C]
But Lillian, I don't-

Id: [0x00070A6D]
Have a good weekend, Mrs. Bock! Fantastic work!

Id: [0x00070A6E]
There, you see? All these bureaucrats need is a little glimpse of our secrets every so often. They like to feel like they're still in charge.

Id: [0x00070A6F]
Lillian is most definitely in charge. She just tripled my budget.

Id: [0x00070A70]
Tripled? Christ, Aileen. You must have discovered who killed Kennedy.

Id: [0x00070A71]
[Laughs]Well, she heard something on one of my tapes that interested her. Something about an Artifact. Very vague. But it was enough.

Id: [0x00070A72]
An artifact. What sort of artifact-

Id: [0x00070A82]
I've an awful Feeling about this. You'll be hurt out there. I couldn't handle that.

Id: [0x00070A9E]
We'll listen first...

Id: [0x00070A9F]
Pirates?

Id: [0x00070AF3]
Miriam... Miriam, is that you? Are you in here?

Id: [0x00070AF4]
Barthel?

Id: [0x00070AF5]
Ah, thank God you're safe! We've been worried sick!

Id: [0x00070AF6]
Barthel, how did they find you? Jesus, what'll they do to you?

Id: [0x00070AF7]
Have they hurt you at all?

Id: [0x00070AF8]
I told them nothing. All they do - every is day - is ask about you and that artifact. But I didn't tell them anything. Nothing-

Id: [0x00070AF9]
I know you didn't, Miriam. But how are YOU? You aren't hurt?

Id: [0x00070AFA]
Not badly, no. I'm fine.

Id: [0x00070AFB]
Good. [beat]We need to get a message out to Oskar. Somehow. We need to tell him where-

Id: [0x00070AFD]
Most of the memories I've been able to access come from a period where Miriam was imprisoned by the Nazi's in Cologne.

Id: [0x00070AFE]
Miriam... is she still alive?

Id: [0x00070AFF]
You're not too busy to be a mom and a genius?

Id: [0x00070B00]
Of course not.

Id: [0x00070B1A]
You believe me, don't you? Can you not see me... standing out there on the Deck of a Ship that's sliding into Port?

Id: [0x00070B2A]
Them your Breds (Brethren)?

Id: [0x00070B2B]
Aye.[Chuckles] We was Privateers together, before the Wars ended.[Beat] I'll see you ashore.

Id: [0x00070B2D]
Go on, Captain Queernabs! Tell me I'm under Arrest! Tell me!

Id: [0x00070B2F]
Fly away, Boyo! Back to your Master!

Id: [0x00070B6C]
[Laughing]A ludicrous Idea![beat] Imagine my Wife with such an Advantage over me.

Id: [0x00070B70]
...Privateer in the West Indies.

Id: [0x00070B72]
Good, good. I shall be here, hard at work.

Id: [0x00070B76]
God sink me for this Pittance. One thousand Reales for those Maps. That's what? A hundred Pounds at most.

Id: [0x00070B77]
How's a Man supposed to become rich in these Times with a Miser like Torres running the World?

Id: [0x00070B78]
Have you ever, ah... you ever worked on a Plantation before?

Id: [0x00070B7A]
You know what I'm thinking?[Beat] I'd like to see this Observatory the Governor was going on about. He said it were like a Device that could follow People around and show where they were.

Id: [0x00070B7B]
Well, imagine what a Thing like that would be worth. Sell that to the right Person and I'd be the richest Pirate-

Id: [0x00070B7D]
I'll catch you up, Bonnet. There's a Sage in that House I must speak to. In private.

Id: [0x00070B8F]
The Governor, right. I think I've kept him waiting long enough.

Id: [0x00070B92]
Oh, it's no great Loss. Uh, I've got a... plenty of Cargo here to make a Profit of my trip.

Id: [0x00070B94]
[Interrogation, 'hum'.]

Id: [0x00070B96]
[cheering.]

Id: [0x00070B98]
[cheering.]

Id: [0x00070B99]
[Dying short.]

Id: [0x00070B9A]
[Pain short.]

Id: [0x00070B9B]
[Effort small.]

Id: [0x00070B9C]
[Breath while running, short.]

Id: [0x00070B9D]
[scared short.]

Id: [0x00070BA0]
[Relief short.]

Id: [0x00070BA1]

[Dying short.]

Id: [0x00070BA3]
[cheering.]

Id: [0x00070BA4]
[cheering.]

Id: [0x00070DD8]
So... What's a Templar Grand Master doing so far from his Castillo?

Id: [0x00070FF9]
A despicable Display!

Id: [0x00070FFB]
This Tosspot is a ruined Man, Caroline. Unfit for life on Land, much less at Sea. If he goes to the West Indies, it's you who'll suffer.

Id: [0x00070FFD]
Father... Father!

Id: [0x00071000]
Come, Love. Up with you now.

Id: [0x00071003]
That old Muckworm. He's wrong about me!

Id: [0x00071007]
I hope it's so.

Id: [0x0007100A]
And there I am, a Man of quality... with a thousand Doubloons spilling from my Pockets like Drops of Rain. I can see it...

Id: [0x0007100D]
I'll be careful, I promise. And when I'm flush with Coin and set up, I'll send for you. I will.

Id: [0x0007101D]
You happened here, Edward. The Damage you caused six Years ago has not been undone.

Id: [0x00071020]
No.[Beat] For Years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a Tinker’s Curse for those I hurt.

Id: [0x00071022]
There is Time to make Amends, Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x00071026]
Mary... before she died she asked me to do Good by her. To sort out the Mess I'd made. Can you help me?

Id: [0x00071043]
You hungry?

Id: [0x0007104C]
You have something for me?

Id: [0x0007104F]
The present Whereabouts of the Templar Woodes Rogers.[Beat] He's attending a small political Function, so do it clean.

Id: [0x00071053]
The Word is King George is calling Rogers back to London.

Id: [0x00071055]
[Laughing]You'll need a Disguise to fool the Powderheads at this Party. I suggest the visiting Diplomat, Ruggiero Ferraro. He's been on our Lists for some Time.

Id: [0x00071059]
Aye. A Ship leaves tomorrow.

Id: [0x0007105B]
Caroline Scott Kenway. Hawkin’s Lane. Bristol.

Id: [0x00071062]
Edward James Kenway. Born of motley Parentage in Swansea... to an English Father and Welsh Mother.

Id: [0x00071064]
Married at eighteen to Miss Caroline Scott, now estranged.

Id: [0x00071066]
She is a beautiful Woman, I'm told. But not at all well these Days.

Id: [0x00071067]
If you touch her, you Bastards, I'll-

Id: [0x00071069]
Quite a Surprise finding you here, rotting in a Jamaican Prison. We heard Rumours that you had taken up with the Pirate Roberts.

Id: [0x0007106A]
If you know the Observatory's Location, tell us now and you'll be out of here in a Flash.

Id: [0x0007106E]
Rogers can hold these British Hounds at Bay for a Time. But this will be your Fate if you fail to cooperate.

Id: [0x00071075]
Do not mistake my Purpose here. I have come for Anne and Mary, and you owe me Nothing for this.

Id: [0x00071077]
I'll need Weapons.

Id: [0x00071081]
I can't promise I'll come, Edward. If you leave on this... fool's Errand... I- I cannot promise anything.

Id: [0x00071084]
Oy. Where are you going? The Market?

Id: [0x00071085]
No, I...[Beat] My Parents have asked me to come live with them. And I'd like to.

Id: [0x00071086]
What do you mean, live with them? You live here. With me.

Id: [0x00071087]
I'm sorry, Edward. But my Father is right. You had a decent Wage when you worked the Farm. Why can you not be satisfied with that? With me?

Id: [0x00071088]
Decent Wage? That Job was near as dammit to Robbery! You want to be married to a Peasant the whole of your Life?

Id: [0x00071089]
All right, Edward.[A pause.] All right.

Id: [0x0007108B]
You leave now Caroline, you'll never know what's coming to us... Caroline! Caroline!

Id: [0x00071098]
And it does not disappoint. He's attracted some Attention there.

Id: [0x0007109B]
[Drunkly laughing]

Id: [0x0007109F]
You let him carry a Pistol, do ye?

Id: [0x000710A2]
Rest and repast while you can, Lads. It's a long way to Nassau.

Id: [0x000710A4]
We'll be sheeting Home soon. You following?

Id: [0x000710A5]
Aye. Close after.

Id: [0x000710A7]
Which of you Scabs drank my breakfast?

Id: [0x000710A9]
[Chuckles]

Id: [0x000710B7]
Right. I'll see who I can Muster.

Id: [0x000710BC]
As was I, Lad. As was I.

Id: [0x000710DC]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000710E0]
Do as you will with her. I'm sure you've had quite enough.

Id: [0x000710E3]
From New Orleans? So you are real after all. What is it that you want if it is not my charm?

Id: [0x000710E4]
Only you. Charmless.

Id: [0x000710E5]
Is it a game of flats you fancy then?

Id: [0x000710E7]
A friend sent me-- Connor. He will offer you safety and training.

Id: [0x000710E8]
[FR][Mademoiselle](Miss), get my charm back, and you can take me as your game pullet.

Id: [0x00071124]
Eh, remind me... where in Africa are we looking?

Id: [0x00071126]
Edward Kenway![Beat] Imagine my Surprise at seeing your Jackdaw anchored there.

Id: [0x00071127]
Have you heard all you came to hear? Will you now go rescue the Sage from our clutching Hands?

Id: [0x00071129]
Because I found a better Path! The Templars know Order. Discipline. Structure.[Beat] But you never could fathom these Subtleties.

Id: [0x0007112A]
Goodbye, old Friend! You were a Soldier once! When you fought for something Real.[Beat] Something beyond yourself!

Id: [0x0007112D]
Principé, Sir. A small Island.

Id: [0x00071133]
Yet here I am... with Riches and a Reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left Home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course I’ve run...[Beat] here’s not a Man or Woman that I love left standing beside me.

Id: [0x00071188]
You're the devil. They were innocent!

Id: [0x00071189]
Their blood is on your hands. What will you tell their masters?

Id: [0x0007118A]
All for my necklace? You still don't have it. You don't even know how to use it!

Id: [0x0007118B]
Restrain her, jail her, discipline her as you must, but remember, I'm paying you to keep her alive.

Id: [0x00071190]
I'll take this now, thank you.

Id: [0x00071192]
Unh unh- no biting!

Id: [0x00071193]
You'll not get away with this. Try what you will, but the power is mine. It will turn to dust in your hands.

Id: [0x00071195]
Are you listening, "Doctor?" I'll make you rue the day!

Id: [0x00071197]
Do what you will with her. I'm sure you've had quite enough.

Id: [0x0007119A]
Patience Gibbs. I warned my guards you'd have nine lives. I shall have to strangle the last of them from you myself.

Id: [0x0007119E]
I warned my guards you'd have nine lives. <br>I shall have to strangle the last of them from you myself.

Id: [0x000711A4]
I'll kill you first! I won't follow my father. It will never be yours!

Id: [0x000711A9]
My life for a dirty piece of savagery... [Dying Breaths]

Id: [0x000711AD]
All this for a dirty piece of savage folklore... I could not bring about its power. It holds some dark magic only you can raise... To think that I once spared you. I could have ended your life, and none would have noticed or cared.

Id: [0x000711BD]
We'll keep in touch. [FR][Bonne journée.](Good day.)

Id: [0x000711C3]
[FR][Bonjour, ça va?](Hello. How's it going?) I hope we're not late.

Id: [0x000711C4]
No. You can go right-

Id: [0x000711C6]
Hi, Melanie. I saw you just walked in. I need a few minutes with you alone. Laetitia's on the phone and we're discussing the Kenway project.

Id: [0x000711C7]
Oh. Yes, of course.

Id: [0x000711CA]
Sorry about this. I'll call you when we're ready.

Id: [0x000711D9]
Why did she spare you! Why are you still HERE!

Id: [0x000711F3]
[Sounds of resisting being strangled.]

Id: [0x000711F4]
[grunting, exertion.]

Id: [0x000711F6]
I told you not to get so close, Ralph.

Id: [0x000711F7]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000711F9]
Let’s get you out of here.[Beat] Follow me.

Id: [0x000711FA]
Like hell I will! I do not trust what I cannot see.

Id: [0x000711FC]
[FR][Merde.](Shit.)

Id: [0x00071212]
Rest and repast while you can, Lads. It's a long way to Nassau.

Id: [0x00071218]
Which of you Scabs drank my breakfast!

Id: [0x0007121A]
[Chuckles]

Id: [0x00071226]
[Laughs]I'm on to you, Sneaksby!

Id: [0x0007122A]
Vance! What a pleasant surprise! I trust you had a safe journey?

Id: [0x0007122B]
Safety.[laughs] What a quaint concept.

Id: [0x0007122C]
Vance, are you well?

Id: [0x0007122F]
You may quit your sympathetic act. I’m well aware of your true identity.

Id: [0x00071232]
Oh do not be so angry! Do you think that I do not know where you go when you're not by my side? How you philander and carouse? How you pretend to love me, but plot to rob me behind my back? We have no secrets between us now!

Id: [0x00071233]
My dear, sweet love. You are alive today because I needed you. But I need you no more.

Id: [0x00071235]
Opia, skulking about in the shadows? Where have you been?

Id: [0x00071236]
I went to take air. You need not worry for my safety.

Id: [0x00071237]
You underestimate the dangers of the world.

Id: [0x00071238]
No Lucia, I would never underestimate you. (after a pause) Lucia, it pains me, but I need your help.

Id: [0x00071239]
With what?

Id: [0x0007123A]
While walking, I was startled by cries of distress. Following them, I discovered a Taino (Ta-ee-no) woman, badly wounded.

Id: [0x0007123B]
And you want me to help? How much is it worth to you?

Id: [0x0007123C]
I think you already know.

Id: [0x0007123D]
I do, but I want you to say it.

Id: [0x0007123E]
As you wish, then. Leave her to perish.

Id: [0x00071242]
Good man, the cargo was stolen from this very ship. I have no more means of retrieving it than you do!

Id: [0x00071243]
That is indeed troubling. What course of action would you suggest?

Id: [0x00071244]
I know this much: the devil had the gall to impersonate my dress, and my signature! He must hang for this.

Id: [0x00071245]
Ah, yes, hanging. Lord knows any mistake on your part is impossible. An audit of your affairs will no doubt reveal you to be utterly free of any miscalculation or wrongdoing. You English are all alike.

Id: [0x00071246]
You dare speak to me in this manner!

Id: [0x00071248]
Guards! Arrest this man. Show him the price of his impertinence.

Id: [0x00071249]
You never were one to get your own hands, dirty, were you?

Id: [0x0007124A]
Imprison me if you like. Your own conscience, and my brothers will see this matter through to justice.

Id: [0x0007124E]
As you can see, I'm prepared to be very generous.

Id: [0x0007124F]
I can see that!

Id: [0x00071250]
Then you will join our cause?

Id: [0x00071251]
How could I not?

Id: [0x00071252]
Excellent. Stay sharp, remember who puts coins in your purse, and we'll get along just fine.

Id: [0x00071253]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x00071254]
Good Lad. Welcome to the club. You're doing double duty now. It's a bit of risk, but you'll thank me come time to drink the spoils!

Id: [0x00071255]
Yes sir.

Id: [0x000712A4]
That Castillo's well-guarded. We'll need to find a Way in.

Id: [0x000712A6]
[SP][¿Quieres una amiga, gringo? ¿Necesitas una mujer?](You need a Friend, Gringo? You need a Woman?)

Id: [0x000712AA]
You speak English?

Id: [0x000712C1]
[Laugh]I did not find them. I took them. These are Souvenirs.[Laugh]

Id: [0x000712C3]
Two Blades. As is the Custom, [FR][oui](yes)?

Id: [0x00071353]
Where is Patience Gibbs?

Id: [0x00071354]
[Still in pain] Alright. Stop! [He winces] Doctor Judge will take the witch to Fort Washington for questioning.

Id: [0x0007135D]
Devil! They were innocent!

Id: [0x0007135E]
Their blood is on your hands.

Id: [0x0007135F]
You'll never have my mother's charm! I will always be a step ahead.

Id: [0x00071360]
Jail her. Discipline her as you must. But remember, I'm paying you to keep her alive. I must have that charm.

Id: [0x00071362]
I will kill you first! I will avenge my mother!

Id: [0x00071363]
It will never be yours!

Id: [0x00071367]
Release me!

Id: [0x00071368]
I'll have your hides for carpets!

Id: [0x0007136E]
...not nearly enough to deter us.

Id: [0x00071393]
Patience!

Id: [0x00071396]
No! Leave me alone!

Id: [0x00071398]
I can't protect you if you keep running!

Id: [0x00071399]
I will protect myself.

Id: [0x00074DF6]
Don't you dare run from me again.

Id: [0x00074DF7]
The Assassins WILL come for him.

Id: [0x00074E00]
Wrong place at the wrong time, Diego. It's nothing personal.

Id: [0x00074E03]
[Laughs]Bravo, Duncan! Bravo!

Id: [0x00074E08]
[SP][¡Basta ya!](Enough!)

Id: [0x00074E0A]
Now What's your Plan, Mate?

Id: [0x00074E0B]
Find my Weapon and steal a Ship.

Id: [0x00074E14]
Lay aboard, Lads!

Id: [0x00074E17]
Save your Singing for Davy Jones, you Jagabats! It's a hard Wind coming!

Id: [0x00074E18]
The Man speaks True! You lot weigh Anchor. As for the rest, half on the Foremast and half at the Main! Let's outrun this Hurricane!

Id: [0x000753E6]
He does his real work underground, the good Doctor. On the surface, he parades around like a saint, but I know his true nature.

Id: [0x000753EF]
Come, let us try this way.

Id: [0x000753F1]
That's a rough Business there.

Id: [0x000753F2]
Oh yes! Governor Torres runs a tight Operation here. Havana is strict and orderly, but one never feels unsafe on its Streets.

Id: [0x000753F5]
Here, lend us a Doubloon, Sir! Sir! Or a Peso, if you're skint![SP][¡Un peso!](One Peso!)

Id: [0x000753F6]
There's more Englishmen here than I'd have guessed at.

Id: [0x000753F7]
Well, the treaty of Utrecht has burst the Borders of our Empires wide open. Two years ago, I'd have been arrested for trying to sell my Goods here.

Ah! [SP][¡No te resistas, gordinflón!](Stop struggling, Fatman!)

Rest well, Duncan. Tomorrow the Treasure Fleet arrives, and with it your Reward. After which, we will discuss further Schemes.

This is your Doing, Captain Kenway. The Maps you sold to the Templars have led them straight to us. And now the Agents of two Empires know exactly where we operate.

Id: [0x0007542E]
Who's out there?

Id: [0x00075432]
Leave this to me, Mentor.

Id: [0x00075433]
Take this. You'll attract no Attention, and take fewer Lives.

Id: [0x00075434]
Captain Kenway. You have remarkable Skills.

Id: [0x00075435]
Ah, Thanks, Mate. It comes natural.

Id: [0x00075436]
But you are churlish and arrogant, prancing around in a Uniform that you have not earned.

Id: [0x00075437]
[Edward laughs, taken aback.] Everything is permitted. Isn't that your Motto?

Id: [0x00075438]
I absolve you of your Errors in Havana and elsewhere, but you are not welcome here.

Id: [0x00075446]
I do not trust this.

Id: [0x00075448]
I'll handle this. Stay back.

Id: [0x00075453]
Sod this.

Id: [0x00075455]
[Trying to suppress a cry of surprise- falling.]

Id: [0x00075459]
Tell me your name.

Id: [0x0007545A]
Aveline de Grandpré.

Id: [0x00075463]
[Trying to suppress panicked breathing.]

Id: [0x00075464]
[Trying to suppress panicked breathing.]

Id: [0x0007546D]
There he is!

Id: [0x0007546E]
Let's go!

Id: [0x00075479]
We'll have to split up again.

Id: [0x0007547C]
How do we open the gates?

Id: [0x0007548A]
It is from a hymn my mother liked. He must think it is a spell to work with the charm. He is madder than I thought!

Id: [0x0007548B]
What is he chanting?

Id: [0x0007548D]
[sharp intake of breath- surprised]

Id: [0x0007548E]
Eyes open!

Id: [0x0007548F]
I'll be more careful next time.

Id: [0x00075496]
I could not bring about its power. [Breath] It holds a dark magic only your kind can raise...

Id: [0x00075497]
To think that I once spared you.[Breath] I could have ended your life, and no one would have noticed.[Breath] None would have cared.

Id: [0x0007549A]
Patience, will you--

Id: [0x0007549D]
"accompany me to Connor's homestead?"[Beat] I would be honoured.

Id: [0x000754A4]
It's a Ruse to keep us soft before they attack Nassau! You'll see. Mark me.

Id: [0x000754AE]
I can't be sure. For when I look on the Fruits of our Years of Labor, all I see is Sickness... Idleness... Idiocy.

Id: [0x000754AF]
I'd wager the nearest Doctor is sitting pretty in Havana. Not a Place I mean to go.

Id: [0x00075556]
You God damn fucking Knave, Vane!

Id: [0x00075557]
[Laughs]N-nancy boy. Y-you only done half of the fucking Job!

Id: [0x0007555E]
Fucking Hell. Is this my Reward for believing the best about Men? For thinking that a Bilge Rat like you could muster up some fucking Sense, once in a while!

Id: [0x00075560]
Maybe Hornigold was right. Maybe the World does need Men of Ambition... to stop the likes of you from mucking it all up.

Id: [0x00075561]
[Laughs]Or maybe you just don't have the Stones to live with no Regrets[Laughs].

Id: [0x00075562]
Don't save me a Spot in Hell, Shanker. I ain't coming soon.

Id: [0x00075571]
Transfer him to my Residence.

Id: [0x0007557A]
[Pained grunts]

Id: [0x0007557D]
Quiet.

Id: [0x0007557E]
[Pain Grunt]

Id: [0x00075582]
Opía?

Id: [0x00075583]
Why? What is your real Motive?

Id: [0x00075584]
Your Name was on a Map. I may have sold it to a Nest of Templars. In Error. [after a beat] We all make Mistakes.

Id: [0x0007558B]
We will challenge you to a hunting Contest. Gather more Skins than us, and you win.

Id: [0x00075594]
Frigates. Why? Is there anything out there but Fish?

Id: [0x00075595]
No... Those are your Templars. You have a Ship and a pale Face. Vessel and Passport. Meet us at Grand Cayman to help us investigate.

Id: [0x000755AB]
We'll see him to the Prisons, Grand Master.

Id: [0x000755AC]
Double the Watch.

Id: [0x000755AE]
I do wish I could remain to see our Drama done, but I must avail myself of these Winds and Sail for England.

Id: [0x000755B6]
Her Name matches that of the Man who destroyed our Village. We fought and lost, but the Leader did not live to enjoy his Victory.

Id: [0x000755BF]
Here it is. The Home of Vargas. Hide. We'll use the Element of Surprise to our Advantage.

Id: [0x000755D7]
Oh... Easy, Milady. Just thought you might like some Help.

Id: [0x000755FC]
[Beat]No! I cannot die at the hands of the Taíno.

Id: [0x000755FD]
My father saw such Potential in these Islands. Gold... Industry... Freedom... all of it squandered.. You have not a Clue how to use it. [Struggling to breath]He could have brought you Wealth.

Id: [0x000755FE]
You believe we wasted Freedom by living freely? You die a Prisoner of your Templar mores.

Id: [0x000755FF]
Let's not argue with a dead woman.[Heavy Breath and grunt while grabbing the the key]

Id: [0x00075625]
Jesus! Get him out of there! Get him out!

Id: [0x00075629]
Oh my God...

Id: [0x0007562A]
It’ll kill him! He’s not decoupled!

Id: [0x0007562D]
He’s having a fucking seizure! Power down! Now!

Id: [0x0007562F]
Heart rate 170!

Id: [0x00075632]
POWER DOWN NOW!

Id: [0x00075635]
Aileen, Warren here. I was all ready to apologize for the late call but you seem to be away. Maybe with your son. Ah... Listen, since the unfortunate incident with Subject 1... there’s been a lot of dire talk around the office about my Animus project... about shutting it down... about it being unsafe... typical top-brass bull-shit. And if they shut me down, then your Surrogate Initiative goes away too. I’m sure you’re already well aware of that.

Id: [0x0007563D]
How is he?

Id: [0x00075640]
Hour three. Doing well.

Id: [0x00075643]
Are we still in Eighteenth century Hungary?

Id: [0x00075646]
No, his connection is so stable, he's jumped between a few ancestors today. We're in fifteenth-century France now. Turns out he's related to one of Joan of Arc's executioners.

Id: [0x00075649]
[Laughs, sarcastically] Surprise.

Id: [0x0007564C]
Aileen... Yesterday, Vidic asked me to help him work out some of the bugs in his Audio-Visual renderer, and I told him-

Id: [0x00075653]
I need to get back to work...

Id: [0x00075656]
Miriam?[Beat] Miriam, are you awake?

Id: [0x00075658]
Barthel?

Id: [0x0007565A]
Miriam, they are coming for me.

Id: [0x0007565C]
Who is? The guards?

Id: [0x0007565E]
I see them from my window, amassing in the courtyard. My time is up.

Id: [0x00075660]
Barthel, don’t say this! You don’t know that.

Id: [0x00075662]
Forgive me for this, Miriam, but I must tell you something. The artifact. We have it, but only Oskar and I know its location.

Id: [0x00075664]
Don’t tell me.

Id: [0x00075666]
They will release you. Your family has connections. You must take the artifact and bring it to the Assassins. In Paris.

Id: [0x00075668]
Please don’t! I don’t want to know. It’s safer if I don’t.

Id: [0x0007566A]
Hush, now. If I die, knowledge of its location dies with me. You must bring it to the Assassins.

Id: [0x0007566C]
Assassins? I don't understand!

Id: [0x0007566F]
The spire of St. Petrus-

Id: [0x00075671]
No, I don't want to hear!

Id: [0x00075673]
Cell seven! Stand!

Id: [0x00075675]
Navajos lay siege! Navajos lay siege!

Id: [0x00075679]
Barthel! You mustn't-

Id: [0x00075680]
Open.

Id: [0x00075681]
Good morning, Miss Kurtz. You look well, considering the circumstances. Are you rested?

Id: [0x00075683]
Hm. Have you eaten?

Id: [0x00075685]
Your friends are dead, Miriam. Barthel Schink and all his Navajos. His Edelweiss Pirates. Executed for five counts of murder.

Id: [0x00075686]
Without a trial. You must be proud.

Id: [0x0007568A]
THERE WAS NO NEED! They were scum! All of them. You hear me? All of you are Scum! Scum! Scum!

Id: [0x000756D2]
Surprised. We did not think you would keep your Word. Tell us... why do you expect to find your magic Key here?

Id: [0x000756D3]
It holds an irresistible Attraction to Templars, if that is who brought these Ships.

Id: [0x000756D4]
We don't know what the Templars could want here. These people lead simple fishing Lives.

Id: [0x000756D5]
Or perhaps not so simple. I'll go and have a Mingle, see what "we" can find out.

Id: [0x000756DC]
What Business does this Senorita Marquez have here? Her comings and goings frighten the marlin. These foreigners may be flush with Coin but they don't know from Fish.

Id: [0x000756DD]
Doesn’t matter to me. If it means more Work,  she and her Fleet can stay as long as they like. I hear if she likes the look of your Catch, she'll buy the whole thing.

Id: [0x000756EE]
Let's pay the Bait Boy a visit and find out what he knows.

Id: [0x000756F4]
State your Business.

Id: [0x000756F5]
I hope for an Audience with Senorita Marquez.

Id: [0x000756FB]
All right... easy now.

Id: [0x000756FD]
Well, your numbers look good...

Id: [0x000756FF]
Now, let's make sure we didn't break your brain, all right?

Id: [0x00075703]
I need you to move your head and look at these lights. Just here.

Id: [0x00075706]
That's it.

Id: [0x00075707]
Good.

Id: [0x00075709]
Perfect.

Id: [0x0007570B]
Are you okay? I just need you to look at the lights here. One at a time.

Id: [0x0007570C]
Something wrong?

Id: [0x00075712]
[Effort sound]Out with it, lad. Where's Marquez? Why's she Here?

Id: [0x00075715]
[Sigh]I'll take this Ship. Meet me there, if you still want your key.

Id: [0x00075716]
[effort]She's already left for Juventud. Find her there if you must. Her Army will teach you a Lesson.

Id: [0x00075717]
Juventud is the island of our Enemies. If Lucia Marquez has gone there, it is certain we are her Target.

Id: [0x00075721]
It has been a Lifetime since we were here. This Jungle is still thick with Vines and Trickery. Marquez will use this to her Advantage.

Id: [0x00075727]
How many Enemies do you have?

Id: [0x00075728]
When you are Hunted, it sometimes seems that every Stranger is an Enemy. On Juventud, we have been at Truce since the death of the first Marquez, but this Woman could re-ignite our Dispute, if her Price is high enough.

Id: [0x0007572B]
Uh, can't have that.

Id: [0x00076DEC]
But we know she's here, she doesn’t expect us.

Id: [0x00076DF4]
All right. Everything seems fine.

Id: [0x00076DFD]
So, welcome to the Sample 17 Project.

Id: [0x00076E01]
This is for you. The primary tool of our trade.

Id: [0x00076E03]
Your communicator.

Id: [0x00076E05]
Power it up and give it a look. It's pretty slick.

Id: [0x00076E07]
Before you get started, you're gonna need this...

Id: [0x00076E0C]
Testing, testing... 1,2,3... hello, [FR][Bonjour](Hello).

Id: [0x00076E0D]
[FR][C'est bon?](Is it good?) It works?

Id: [0x00076E10]
Nice, right?

Id: [0x00076E12]
At the top of the screen you can read the latest news or check if you’ve received any messages.

Id: [0x00076E13]
You can also have a look at your daily itinerary...

Id: [0x00076E14]
There’s also a list of your previous achievements and completed tasks.

Id: [0x00076E15]
Of course, if you ever get lost, there’s also a map available with your position updated in real-time.

Id: [0x00076E17]
All right. Let's take a walk.

Id: [0x00076E20]
Impressive, right?

Id: [0x00076E21]
Maybe you saw Liberation? That was our first title powered by Animus tech.

Id: [0x00076E22]
And we think we found the perfect subject for our first full-length virtual feature: Caribbean pirates!

Id: [0x00076E23]
So that's your gig.

Id: [0x00076E2A]
Lucia Marquez, if it's us you're after, come out and fight like a Woman of Honour.

Id: [0x00076E30]
Go, after her. We will keep her Attention focused here. But be careful she does not detect you.

Id: [0x00076E45]
[FR][Magnifique! Merci.](Wonderful! Thank you.)

Id: [0x00076E46]
Where'd you run off to?

Id: [0x00076E47]
You didn't go home did you?

Id: [0x00076E4E]
So here we are, your very own Animus workstation.

Id: [0x00076E5C]
This pair of legs is John, one of the wizards in IT. He's just fixing something for you.

Id: [0x00076E5D]
[FR][Salut, Melanie.](Hello, Melanie.)[2 cheek kiss greeting] [FR][Ca va bien?](How are you?)

Id: [0x00076E5E]
Well, thanks.

Id: [0x00076E60]
Have you met our new hire? Just started today.

Id: [0x00076E62]
I haven't. [FR][Bonjour. ](Hello.) What project?

Id: [0x00076E63]
Sample 17. The Kenway line.

Id: [0x00076E64]
Haytham? Connor?

Id: [0x00076E65]
Edward. The pirate!

Id: [0x00076E66]
Ah... Arrrgh... Yarrr matey![Stupid laugh.] Very exciting. Welcome aboard.

Id: [0x00076E69]
Melanie, can we talk in your office for a minute?

Id: [0x00076E6A]
Just let me get this one settled and I'll see you in... five minutes?

Id: [0x00076E70]
You might have noticed that security seems a little light around here.

Id: [0x00076E71]
That's because your communicator is your key to getting around.

Id: [0x00076E83]
Opía! And how are "we" today?

Id: [0x00076E8A]
You must try to understand what it is at Stake.

Id: [0x00076E8E]
It's Rhona, right?

Id: [0x00076E8F]
Kenway. Looking for Trouble, I assume?

Id: [0x00076E91]
[Sigh]You sober enough for Target Practice?[Effort sound while standing up]

Id: [0x00076E94]
So Thatch has been topped... Fuck's sake.

Id: [0x00076E95]
Aren't you the crafty one? Whatever gave it away?

Id: [0x00076E96]
[Effort sound when taking cover]Possibly, I had a hand in selling a "sensitive Document" to one of those Templar Chaps you're so fond of.

Id: [0x00076E98]
Yes... well, there's a Key. Most likely in the pocket of your Templar Suitor. I need it.

Id: [0x00076E99]
I'll tell you what: if I think of a Chore that requires the Help of an especially simple Fellow, I'll let you know.

Id: [0x00076E9B]
So, is this your new persona? Sir Edward of Havana, rescues Damsels in Distress?

Id: [0x00076E9C]
I've come to warn you: your life's in Danger.

Id: [0x00076E9E]
Yes. As I'm indisposed, and my Sense of Duty runs deeper than my Pride, there's a Situation I hope you can investigate.

Id: [0x00076E9F]
A boosey Swill Tub like me? Are you sure?

Id: [0x00076EA3]
I won't let you down.

Id: [0x00076EA4]
It would be hard to get much lower than this.

Id: [0x000771E7]
Against who?

Id: [0x000771E8]
Me.

Id: [0x000771EB]
I did some Research too. It's clear as Day: the whole Operation's run by that Templar Scoundrel, Hilary Flint.

Id: [0x000771EE]
Let's waste no Time.

Id: [0x00077211]
I'll engage him in Combat. And You circle around - carefully - and well, you know the rest.

Id: [0x00077559]
Suddenly squeamish, Rhona? Can't quite bring yourself to kill him?

Id: [0x0007755E]
[Struggle Breathing]I knew we would end in Fire, but I always thought our Positions would be reversed. I should have died happier, knowing there was one less Assassin in the World.

Id: [0x00077562]
No.[Beat] It's too late.

Id: [0x00077563]
Would, uh... you two, like a Moment alone?

Id: [0x00077565]
[Breaths]Take it. His Charm's all used up. Let the Memory of him be locked away for good.

Id: [0x00077566]
Really? And why don't I want this Key for myself?

Id: [0x00077567]
Rhona, I know you're no Stranger to a Man's Boots but the Suit this Key unlocks won't fit you.

Id: [0x00078933]
[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x00078935]
[Laugh]Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x00078937]
!*It may be he remembers where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x00078F3F]
I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x00078F48]
Where did you find all these?

Id: [0x00078F4A]
No, indeed. Would you kill him, Duncan? He's an embarrassment to our Order.

Id: [0x00078F4B]
Attention, Dog! You're about to die!

Id: [0x00078F55]
Anything for a Lady.

Id: [0x00078F69]
I know you've come to call me Home, Kenway. And your Faith in me is kind. But with Nassau done in, I feel I'm finished.

Id: [0x00078F6A]
I'm not of the same Mind, Mate. But I won't begrudge you the State of yours.

Id: [0x00078F6E]
And does it suit me, Mopsie?

Id: [0x00078F6F]
Better than your old Personality. Really Edward, why are you here?

Id: [0x00078F85]
Have you reconsidered my offer, Rhona?

Id: [0x00078F86]
Go on.

Id: [0x00078F87]
Mind, I said "investigate" a Situation, not create one.

Id: [0x00078F88]
Yes Mum, what is it?

Id: [0x00078F89]
A Rash of Thefts and Mischief. Seems too convenient it started at the same Time as these Bureau Attacks. Could you see what you can find out around the Market?

Id: [0x00078F8A]
He's in the Lead, I take it?

Id: [0x00078F8B]
Yes, but with your Map, we can destroy his Weapons Stores to catch up.

Id: [0x00078F9A]
[Sighs]Ah! We're on to Something, I can feel it...

Id: [0x00078F9C]
Where is the Assassin, Duncan Walpole?

Id: [0x00078F9D]
Remember? That was years ago and I still can't get the smell out!

Id: [0x00078F9E]
Sorry about that. I've since learned that kill-devil Rum and the Jig don't mix on a belly full of Dog Flesh.

Id: [0x00078FA1]
Rhona, do you remember when we first met?

Id: [0x00078FA4]
The Storehouse is there.

Id: [0x00078FA5]
I'll take out the Watch. You blow the Powder.

Id: [0x00078FA8]
What sort of Chap is this Flint fellow?

Id: [0x00078FA9]
Arrogant. Crass. Sarcastic. Always on about his Guns.

Id: [0x00078FAB]
Shut your Mouth! That mangy Templar Fox isn't fit to kiss my Boots.

Id: [0x00078FAE]
The pub? Instead of what? Do tell.

Id: [0x00078FAF]
No. Don't ask.

Id: [0x00078FB0]
Just how long have you been chasing this Flint?

Id: [0x00078FB1]
[Sigh]Too long. If I'd realized what he was, I'd have run him through that first night at the Pub, instead of--

Id: [0x00078FB9]
Has a strange Look. Is it worth Something?

Id: [0x00078FBD]
Nothing you can spend. But if you find all of 'em, it'll lead to Something grand.

Id: [0x00078FBF]
This way. I've Something else to show you.

Id: [0x00078FC5]
Ah! [Grunt reaction when grabbed]

Id: [0x00078FC6]
Not a Word.[Beat] Come on.

Id: [0x00078FC7]
Like this one?

Id: [0x00078FC9]
Aye. They meant to ask him about the Observatory too, but he escaped.

Id: [0x00078FCB]
Is that why we're whispering?

Id: [0x00078FCC]
[to James]They have taken Edward's Crew as well.[beat] I wonder what their Lives are worth to him?

Id: [0x00078FCE]
See that mangy old Codger? He's a Dutch Slaver called Laurens Prins. Living now like a King in Jamaica.

Id: [0x00078FD0]
Well hello, your Excellency. I'd got Word you Might be here.

Id: [0x00078FD6]
Wouldn't you prefer meeting in a Pub?

Id: [0x00078FD8]
I came to Kingston chasing a Target. Getting pissed ain`t a Priority.

Id: [0x00078FD9]
We could work together on this, you know. It's Laurens Prins you're after, and I want his Prisoner.

Id: [0x00078FDD]
We're after the Sage, as well, Edward. Careful who you cross.

Id: [0x00078FDE]
May the best Man win.

Id: [0x00078FDF]
There's Guards patrolling that Property from End to End.[A beat] Looks to me like they use Bells to signal Trouble. See there?

Id: [0x00078FE1]
We'll want to disable those before pushing too far.

Id: [0x00078FE3]
With so many Men about, we can't rely on Stealth alone. So... I'll do what I can to distract and draw their Attention, giving you a Chance to cut 'em Down.

Id: [0x00078FE4]
Ready?

Id: [0x00078FE9]
But not a Word of it to Anyone. Or I'll unman you as well.

Id: [0x00078FF9]
[Pain grunt and laughs]Captain Kenway. Ever a Splinter in my Side. Does this Murder fulfill you?

Id: [0x00079007]
Father, help me!

Id: [0x0007900A]
This little Rascal, however, IS a Kenway. What's wrong, Haytham?

Id: [0x0007900B]
I can't see the Stage!

Id: [0x0007900E]
Congratulations. Your Mission was a Success.

Id: [0x0007900F]
How can I make Amends?

Id: [0x00079012]
Hm... I see you haven't lost your Charm.

Id: [0x00079013]
And you're still boosey as a Swill Tub. What do you want?

Id: [0x0007901D]
Alright then. I'll imagine it.

Id: [0x0007902B]
Edward, you are begging for a Flogging--

Id: [0x0007903B]
[Pained]What a Pity, we could never fight together on the Correct Side of things.

Id: [0x000791B4]
Ah! [Pain Grunts]

Id: [0x000791BA]
Stop him!

Id: [0x000791D8]
[SP][¡Maldita sea, campesino! ¡Responde cuando se te habla!](God damned, Peasant! Answer when you're spoken to!)

Id: [0x000791DE]
Bloody Hell.

Id: [0x000791EF]
I'll gut you, Jack Rackham! I'll open you up, I'll tear out your Organs, and string a bloody Lute with 'em!

Id: [0x000791F0]
Stop your god damned Howling, Vane! It's no bloody Use!

Id: [0x000791F1]
Well, well, the fearsome Edward Kenway speaks! Pray tell us, Captain, how to quit this Predicament! And tell us what Genius you have for sailing a Boat with no Sails and no Rudder!

Id: [0x000791F9]
Keep still now![A beat] I'll take these Oysters you've hoarded.

Id: [0x000791FB]
You mad Sap. The Island's crawling with Food if only you'd care to look for it.

Id: [0x000791FC]
I am looking, Lout. I found some just here.[Laughs]

Id: [0x00079200]
Don't! Don't come following now! You hear me! Don't come looking for me![Panting]

Id: [0x00079203]
Wretched Fool.

Id: [0x00079209]
Shut your Gob!

Id: [0x0007920E]
Jaysus! You've lost your Head, Man!

Id: [0x00079210]
It's a fair Exchange for finding these Flintlocks and Grenadoes!

Id: [0x00079212]
You and your bloody Fairy Stories got us into this Mess, Kenway. And I'll be damned if I let you drag me into another!

Id: [0x00079215]
Listen Vane! We could hunt with those Guns!

Id: [0x00079216]
[laughs]And I mean to!

Id: [0x00079218]
You keep this up, I'll have to Kill ya, Vane!

Id: [0x00079219]
Bloody try! By all means!

Id: [0x0007921C]
It's either you or me who's leaving this Island alive, Welcher! 'Cause I'm not gonna sail again in a World cursed by your ugly Mug!

Id: [0x00079220]
This Bahjohn works for the Royal African Company. Tell him what you told me.

Id: [0x00079221]
What else?

Id: [0x00079227]
Grand Master! Welcome.

Id: [0x0007922B]
[SP][Buenas Noches](Good evening.) What have you learned?

Id: [0x0007922C]
The Princess was taken by Pirates six Weeks ago. And so far as we know, the Sage Roberts was still aboard.

Id: [0x0007922D]
Very good. It is something, no?

Id: [0x00079273]
Wake up, Kenway.

Id: [0x00079274]
Mmm...[waking] Ah... Kidd.

Id: [0x00079277]
He left this Morning with the Galleon. Has Faith we'll discover a good Use for this old Cove ourselves.

Id: [0x00079287]
What the Devil...

Id: [0x00079298]
[Laughs]Were it not for Rum and Reales, we might have been Heroes, eh Kenway?

Id: [0x0007929B]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither![Breath out]

Id: [0x000792A3]
[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x000792A9]
Hsst!

Id: [0x000792AB]
They're setting Sail within the Hour.

Id: [0x000792AC]
We'll handle it. Is Captain Kenway among them?

Id: [0x000792AD]
Aye. He's been pressing a poor Bloke all day. Really having a go.

Id: [0x000792AE]
Bloody Savage he is. Wait here.

Id: [0x000792F5]
What's our Course, Captain?

Id: [0x000792F6]
Principé, Quartermaster. We're sailing for the Coast of Africa.

Id: [0x000792FD]
[Breaths]You done us Good, Kenway. Proved yourself a true Bravo. And for what?

Id: [0x0007930D]
We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00079315]
We've sent two of our best Men, Burgess and Cockram. Privateers with fast Ships and Firm Hearts.

Id: [0x00079318]
Hm. What of the Sage's present Location? Do we know?

Id: [0x00079319]
Africa, your Excellency.

Id: [0x0007931A]
Africa! By God, the Winds do not favor that Route.

Id: [0x0007931D]
You stepped in the Path of my Prize. Not a thing a Man should do.

Id: [0x0007931E]
[Laughs]A cocksure Cully, just like Hornigold said.

Id: [0x0007931F]
And you're worse for it, Kenway! It were the Templars who took us in when all else went to Shit! Not our King. Not our Country. The Templars.

Id: [0x00079321]
Is that Pirate Hunter dead?

Id: [0x00079322]
Aye. By my own Hand.

Id: [0x0007932A]
Oh, your Jackdaw has flown, Edward, eh? That's the beauty of a Democracy... the many outvote the one.

Id: [0x0007932B]
Luckily, I know the King's Bounty on your Head is a large One. And I... intend to collect.

Id: [0x00079359]
My love!

Id: [0x0007935A]
Do you have the map?

Id: [0x0007935B]
Not yet. Not yet.

Id: [0x0007935D]
What am I to tell my Order? You know we can't leave until I have it!

Id: [0x0007935E]
I am taking care of it. Give me time.

Id: [0x0007935F]
More time? Your loyalty makes you soft. I think you are not man enough to see it through.

Id: [0x00079360]
My flower, it is all but done. I have hired a man. In moments, Upton's life will be over and the map will be ours.

Id: [0x00079361]
You hired a man? In your scriptures, did Cain hire a man? No. Cain was a man. "Come to the field" he said to Abel, and he did it himself. He did not require a third man to carry the axe.

Id: [0x00079395]
The Templars is our Family. Where's yours?

Id: [0x00079399]
Have you... have you ever seen the Inside of a Jamaican Prison, Boy? Have you?

Id: [0x000793A2]
His own bloody Pride.

Id: [0x000793A3]
That Templar Scab means nothing to me. None of you do.

Id: [0x000793A5]
A precious Tool, you see?

Id: [0x000793A7]
Good morning, Duncan!

Id: [0x000793A8]
Duncan, over here.

Id: [0x000793A9]
Hello!

Id: [0x000793C6]
Sorcery. That's what it is.

Id: [0x000793C8]
Not so. Every Mechanism that gives this Device its Light is a true and physical Thing. Ancient yes, but Nothing supernatural or strange.

Id: [0x000793CA]
We'll be Masters of the Ocean with that.

Id: [0x000793CC]
Oh... Such Ambition.

Id: [0x000793D0]
There's nothing in my Code about Loyalty, Boy! You played your Role, but our Partnership is Done!

Id: [0x000793D2]
You're a dead Man, Roberts!

Id: [0x000793DC]
Ahoy Kenway. Who's this?

Id: [0x000793EA]
Aye. We'll make Something of it in Time.

Id: [0x000793EC]
We could keep a Fleet here, if we liked. And with a bit of fixing up, it'd be decent Place to call Home. Might even convince my Wife to come one Day.

Id: [0x000793EE]
You're married, are ya?

Id: [0x000793EF]
In God's Eyes, I am. She left me some Time ago.

Id: [0x000793F0]
Even so, keep that Fact hid away. Most of these Pirates don't respect a Man with higher Commitments than Rum and Plunder.

Id: [0x000793F3]
Meet me at twenty Degrees, three Minutes Latitude, just off the coast of Yucatan. I'll have Something to show you there in a few Weeks time.

Id: [0x000793F9]
The Violence he'd cause with this Thing would be subtle, but Heavy. Deadly, yet leaving no Mark.[Beat] Does that make Sense?

Id: [0x00079403]
I'm only seeing a Job done, Torres. As you'd have done with Me.

Id: [0x00079404]
As we have done, I think. You have no Family anymore, no Friends, no Future. Your Losses are far greater than ours.

Id: [0x00079407]
You would see all of Mankind corralled into a neatly furnished Prison, safe and sober, yet dulled beyond Reason and sapped of all Spirit.

Id: [0x0007940E]
[Heavy breath]If you could speak, Mate... it would gladden me to hear your Side.

Id: [0x00079410]
[A hard exhale]

Id: [0x00079412]
You humbled me once and I took that hard Lesson and I bettered myself. Die knowing that for all our Conflict, you helped make a Soldier out of a Scoundrel.

Id: [0x00079415]
Leave this Life for a lasting Peace, down among the Dead.

Id: [0x00079418]
We got word Torres left the City. Who were you chasing?

Id: [0x00079419]
That Vial was labeled Torres, but held the Blood of his Second.[beat] Where's he gone?

Id: [0x0007941D]
The Observatory.

Id: [0x0007942C]
There's no drinking after Death, Lads, so fill up here with what you'll lack in Hell!

Id: [0x0007942D]
[Laughing]

Id: [0x0007942E]
Argh! Got a powerful Bite this Barbadian Swill. A pinch of Gunpowder might cut the Sting.

Id: [0x0007942F]
Where's my Lady got to?[Breath out]

Id: [0x00079430]
All hands on Deck!

Id: [0x00079431]
Half to Quarters, half Aloft!

Id: [0x00079432]
Hoist Anchor!

Id: [0x00079433]
Keep your Powder dry!

Id: [0x00079438]
[Cheerings]

Id: [0x000795C3]
Head's up, Kenway!

Id: [0x000795C5]
I found your Man!

Id: [0x000795D0]
Roberts!

Id: [0x000795D1]
I said not to follow!

Id: [0x000795D9]
[Whispering]Yes, and yet all for a greater Purpose. To ensure Justice. To snuff out Lies and to seek Truth.

Id: [0x000795DA]
There's no Man on Earth who needs that Power.

Id: [0x000795E2]
Torres awakened something fierce! Are we safe?

Id: [0x000795E3]
With the Device returned, I believe so.

Id: [0x000795E7]
Captain Kenway's Folly.

Id: [0x000795EB]
[MY][Jets' a wóol te' suutukila'. Ka' weenen.](Quiet now. Go back to sleep.)

Id: [0x000795EE]
We will seal this Place, and discard the Key. Until another Sage appears, this Door will remain locked.

Id: [0x000795EF]
You could join us in that Cause.

Id: [0x000795F1]
I will. But... only after I fix what I mangled back Home.

Id: [0x000795FC]
Perhaps another Day.

Id: [0x000795FD]
What?

Id: [0x000795FE]
Next time, see to it that we are not followed![Loudly] Deal with this!

Id: [0x00079601]
Another?

Id: [0x00079603]
A Rum Flip this Time.

Id: [0x00079604]
And where'd I find fresh Eggs in this wretched Town? There's little else but Piss and Insects.

Id: [0x00079606]
Aye. We're working on that.

Id: [0x0007960D]
Walk with us, Kenway. There's Trouble brewing...

Id: [0x0007960F]
Gentlemen. How do you find it here?

Id: [0x00079610]
It will work for us. But our Goal must be to scatter our Operations. To live and work among the People we protect, just as Altair Ibn La-Ahad once counseled.

Id: [0x00079611]
Well until that Time, it's yours as you see fit.

Id: [0x00079613]
Edward...

Id: [0x00079615]
Captain Woodes Rogers survived his Wounds. He has since returned to England... shamed and in great Debt, but no less a Threat.

Id: [0x00079616]
I will finish that Job when I return. You have my Word.

Id: [0x00079617]
Evening, Anne.

Id: [0x00079619]
[Slight laugh]England's the wrong Way 'round the Globe for an Irishwoman.

Id: [0x0007961A]
Will you stay with the Assassins?

Id: [0x0007961B]
No. I haven't got that kind of Conviction in my Heart.[Beat] You?

Id: [0x0007961D]
Sail ho! Coming into the Cove!

Id: [0x00079632]
Well, goodly Anne I-

Id: [0x00079635]
I found one Crate hidden beneath a school of Sharks. Sadly, the Elixir inside is...

Id: [0x00079637]
...quite spoilt.

Id: [0x00079639]
Eagh!

Id: [0x0007963A]
Plague and perish! Will we steal Medicines now?

Id: [0x0007963C]
Remember the Pardon, Thatch. We're to be Subtle.

Id: [0x0007963F]
Ahoy! Any Luck?

Id: [0x00079640]
Says Hornigold! A Pirate now too proud to call himself one!

Id: [0x00079641]
Ah, he prefers Caution to Cannons.

Id: [0x00079643]
And would you be the Devil?

Id: [0x00079645]
For an Audience, aye.[Beat] It’s all a big Show.

Id: [0x00079647]
Looks fine.

Id: [0x00079648]
'Course it does.

Id: [0x0007964B]
If you can find a quiet Way to acquire Medicines, tell me soon. Otherwise, I'll handle it meself.

Id: [0x0007964C]
[effort grunt]

Id: [0x0007964D]
Ah...[sigh]

Id: [0x00079651]
[Dying rattle.]

Id: [0x00079653]
Left Port this morning, heading West along the Coast.

Id: [0x0007965E]
Caution's Nothing without Charisma! For if a Man plays the Fool, then it's only Fools he'll persuade. But appear to be the Devil, and all Men will submit.

Id: [0x00079664]
Kill him?

Id: [0x00079667]
When we see the Sage, you bring in the Rest of the Gold, make the Swap, and get out. I'll be watching from close by.

Id: [0x0007966B]
I've no need for Schooling. How many Prizes did we take together as Privateers?

Id: [0x0007966E]
There's a Chasm of difference between joining a Raid, and Captaining one.

Id: [0x0007966F]
That may be. But killing you rights a far greater Wrong than ever I did.

Id: [0x00079670]
You Honestly believe that?

Id: [0x00079671]
So, aye... with everything I've seen and learned in these last Years, I do believe it.

Id: [0x00079673]
You wear your Convictions well. They suit you...

Id: [0x00079674]
Yet you suffer the Outlaw Roberts to use it!

Id: [0x00079675]
No. I'm taking it back. And If you tell me where he is, I'll stop the Man.

Id: [0x00079677]
[Laughs]Here at the Edge of a Blade, I find a Friend in you at last! Principé, you mad Bastard. Our best Sources say Principé...

Id: [0x0007967D]
In Time, aye... when my Mind is settled and my Blood is cooled.

Id: [0x00079680]
Give your Quarry something to fear, some hellish Thing from a fever’d Dream, and Men will drop to their Knees pleading for their Lord before aught else! [Grunt]

Id: [0x00079681]
Oh God...

Id: [0x00079687]
Hello?

Id: [0x00079689]
Jenkins! Is you out here?

Id: [0x0007968F]
Ah ah ah ah! One fewer!

Id: [0x00079690]
Keep at it!

Id: [0x00079691]
Down she goes!

Id: [0x00079692]
Sending Davy Jones another Handmaiden![Short Laugh]

Id: [0x00079693]
That's aiming True!

Id: [0x00079694]
Down, you Sluggards![Short laugh]

Id: [0x00079697]
Keep her steady!

Id: [0x00079698]
Luff us, Lads! Into the Action!

Id: [0x0007969B]
Where's the Flagship of this motley Fleet?

Id: [0x0007969C]
Peace, Thatch. Careful what you whish for.

Id: [0x0007969E]
Is it a Man-O-War?

Id: [0x000796A0]
Will we follow?

Id: [0x000796A2]
Send Word to Ah Tabai. We've cornered our Man.

Id: [0x000796A4]
A manky looking Thing. Is that what I think it is?

Id: [0x000796A5]
Aye. Watch.

Id: [0x000796A7]
Through the blood of the Governor, we can see through his Eyes.

Id: [0x000796AB]
Keep this safe. Just in case.

Id: [0x000796AE]
I'll be at the Bureau.[Pause] Good luck.

Id: [0x000796B0]
[Cheering.]

Id: [0x000796B1]
[Laughing.]

Id: [0x000796B2]
Can you feel it, Adé? We're Moments away from the grandest Prize of all.

Id: [0x000796B3]
I feel nothing but a hot Wind in my Ears, Captain.

Id: [0x000796B4]
Come on, Man. When we take this Treasure, we'll be set for Life. All of us. Ten times over.

Id: [0x000796B5]
As you wish.

Id: [0x000796B7]
Ahoy, Roberts! We'll cast Anchor and meet ashore.

Id: [0x000796B8]
You were followed, Captain Kenway. How long for, I wonder?

Id: [0x000796BA]
It's Hornigold.

Id: [0x000796BB]
Deal with your old Friend in Haste, Captain. Before I regret my Favor to you.

Id: [0x000796C6]
I'll be sailing for London in the next few Months.[Beat] I'd be a hopeful Man if you were beside me.

Id: [0x000796D9]
Set a Course, due North, Lads. We're off to find Captain Thatch!

Id: [0x000796E6]
...Stealing a fishing Schooner single-Handed? Damned canny, Captain.

Id: [0x000796E7]
Hang in there, Man. We're getting close.

Id: [0x000796EB]
Aye, you could sail with me, but... with a Temper as hot as yours, I fear you'd burn us all to Cinders.

Id: [0x000796EC]
On your Feet.

Id: [0x000796ED]
Jaysus, Adé. What the Hell happened here?

Id: [0x000796EE]
I'm not an easy Man to call a Friend, am I? Is that why you're here?

Id: [0x000796F5]
Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x00079708]
You there! Get lost!

Id: [0x0007AD27]
Oh don't be jealous!

Id: [0x0007AD28]
Jealous? I'm not jealous!

Id: [0x0007AD29]
I'll show you the Bill of Sale if you like. Senorita Marquez's right hand man, Vargas, signed it Himself. She is using his Home as her Headquarters. I even met her there when I delivered the Fish!

Id: [0x0007AD30]
I did! But you know, this is exactly why they call me the King of Fishermen!

Id: [0x0007AD31]
Who calls you that?

Id: [0x0007AD33]
Stranger! What are you doing?

Id: [0x0007AD36]
As is taking back my Brig from this Pillock. Once again, I thank you both.

Id: [0x0007AEE8]
Here's another Door. Looks to be the last Mechanism...

Id: [0x0007AEED]
I think I fixed that for ya.

Id: [0x0007AF0D]
[Effort long.]

Id: [0x0007AF1E]
[Interrogation, 'uh?'.]

Id: [0x0007AF3B]
Sorry, Mate. Wish it were otherwise.

Id: [0x0007AF3F]
Damn you, old Scratch! Keep your Natty hands off me!

Id: [0x0007AF40]
I can't let you Kill those Men, Kidd. Not until I've found the Sage.

Id: [0x0007AF41]
I been stalking that Pig for a Week now, charting his Moves! And here I find not one but TWO of my Targets... and you rob me of both!

Id: [0x0007AF45]
Follow us.

Id: [0x0007AF47]
If she is, we are not safe.

Id: [0x0007AF49]
You think this Woman is related?

Id: [0x0007AF4D]
The Bill of Sale we stole gives the Address of a Man in her Employ, Vargas.

Id: [0x0007AF50]
No. It's more than your Key. There are those who say the Taíno are already extinct. But we will never be extinguished. Our Fight continues.

Id: [0x0007AF53]
You must hide.

Id: [0x0007AF54]
Right there. Take Position.

Id: [0x0007AF57]
Chase him!

Id: [0x0007AF59]
[Sigh]Here's my Prize.

Id: [0x0007AF64]
Patience, Man.[Beat] You'll have your Kills.

Id: [0x0007AF66]
When I locate the Sage, you're helping me take Prins. Got that?

Id: [0x0007AF73]
Whatever improves my Lot in Life.

Id: [0x0007AF74]
Burn and flay that Turncoat.

Id: [0x0007AF76]
Not today.

Id: [0x0007AF7A]
To fight beside a Man so driven by personal Gain and Glory is a hard Thing, Edward. And I have come to feel the Assassins - and their Creed - a more honourable Course.

Id: [0x0007AF83]
Will you hand over the charm, sweet thing, or is it a physical exam you crave? I assure you, I've brought all of my instruments.

Id: [0x0007AF8F]
[Death, last breaths.]

Id: [0x0007AF90]
[Last dying breaths.]

Id: [0x0007AFA6]
[SP][No, no inglés. No, señor.](No, no English. No Sir.)

Id: [0x0007AFA7]
But Gold is a Language we all speak, isn't it?

Id: [0x0007AFAA]
Here's my Dilemma. Shall I find a Secret way in? Or slip past those Soldiers?

Id: [0x0007AFAB]
Mary?[Beat] Mary, It's me! Edward!

Id: [0x0007AFAC]
Edward? Who's this Fella!

Id: [0x0007AFAE]
She's ill.

Id: [0x0007AFAF]
And her Child?

Id: [0x0007AFB3]
Can you walk?

Id: [0x0007AFB6]
I know it pains, M'Lady. But we must be silent.

Id: [0x0007AFBB]
Lean on me, Mary. Come on.

Id: [0x0007AFBC]
[effort sounds]I can't... [Out of breath, struggling]

Id: [0x0007AFBD]
Search every Cell!

Id: [0x0007AFBE]
Come on. That's it.

Id: [0x0007AFC1]
You're all right.

Id: [0x0007AFC5]
[Effort sound]I ain't leaving you nowhere! No bloody way!

Id: [0x0007AFC6]
There's no one here!

Id: [0x0007AFC7]
Put me down, Edward!

Id: [0x0007AFCB]
[Pained breaths]Don't die on my Account. Go.

Id: [0x0007AFD2]
Aye, Edward. For I've another Calling elsewhere.

Id: [0x0007AFD5]
Have I been unfair?

Id: [0x0007AFDB]
[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007AFDC]
[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007AFF1]
I need you to follow closely behind me. Do you think you can keep up?

Id: [0x0007AFF5]
I will go after the doctor!

Id: [0x0007AFFB]
[Groans of agony]

Id: [0x0007B009]
None of your concern.

Id: [0x0007B00A]
I'll force it from you.

Id: [0x0007B00B]
I'm no turncoat.

Id: [0x0007B00E]
Where is she?

Id: [0x0007B010]
[Short groans of agony]

Id: [0x0007B01F]
[Cry of distress.]

Id: [0x0007B020]
[Cry of exertion.]

Id: [0x0007B021]
[Cry of pain.]

Id: [0x0007B022]
[Cry of pain.]

Id: [0x0007B023]
[Cry of distress.]

Id: [0x0007B024]
[Cry of exertion.]

Id: [0x0007B02C]
Fine![Sigh]

Id: [0x0007B036]
Then let's go.

Id: [0x0007B041]
I'll scout ahead.

Id: [0x0007B042]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0007B043]
How do I get up there?

Id: [0x0007B044]
I'll show you.

Id: [0x0007B045]
You can make that jump?

Id: [0x0007B046]
Watch.

Id: [0x0007B047]
Give me a boost?

Id: [0x0007B048]
I'm stuck again.

Id: [0x0007B049]
Run ahead.

Id: [0x0007B04A]
Steady does it.

Id: [0x0007B04D]
Wait. Look.

Id: [0x0007B04F]
Now what.

Id: [0x0007B052]
'Course. 'Cause that worked so well the last time...

Id: [0x0007B053]
We are sitting ducks.

Id: [0x0007B054]
Shh.

Id: [0x0007B05C]
He's a Templar, like Rogers and Hornigold. Men cooking up Schemes to use the Observatory for ill Purposes. For Power and Control.

Id: [0x0007B060]
What d'ye call this Place?

Id: [0x0007B077]
Aye, not happy with his Progress in Nassau.

Id: [0x0007B078]
Still too many Pirates roaming about, from what I hear.

Id: [0x0007B07B]
Grab your Kit and pack well. We're sailing for Africa.

Id: [0x0007B07F]
Understood.[Beat] Will you send this to England for me?

Id: [0x0007B081]
[MY][Yaan u muuk' a wóol yéetel a piixan](You have Strength and Spirit.) And once more you have our Thanks, Edward. You are welcome here.

Id: [0x0007B083]
How's her Child?

Id: [0x0007B085]
She's a strong Woman. But not invincible.

Id: [0x0007B08A]
What's our Course?

Id: [0x0007B08B]
Kingston. I mean to stop what I set in Motion six years back. That means killing Rogers, Roberts, and Torres... and taking back that damned Device.

Id: [0x0007B08C]
That'll fetch us a nice Price.

Id: [0x0007B08D]
No. [A beat]Not this Time.

Id: [0x0007B08F]
It arrived last week.

Id: [0x0007B091]
There were Vials when I came here last. Filled with the Blood of ancient Men, Roberts said. But they're gone now.

Id: [0x0007B093]
Then it's up to us to Recover them. Before the Templars catch Wind of this.

Id: [0x0007B095]
It's done.

Id: [0x0007B097]
Where now?

Id: [0x0007B09C]
It's how long to Principé, Captain?

Id: [0x0007B09D]
With a fair Wind, eight Weeks is possible.

Id: [0x0007B09E]
Christ. On a half-pint of Rum a day, we'll be Dry in Four.

Id: [0x0007B0A8]
Thank you, Sir. I'll rest here a Time before setting out, if I may.

Id: [0x0007B0AA]
Might be this is God's way of saying I'm not fit to be a Mother yet. Carrying on like I do. cursing, and drinking, and fighting.

Id: [0x0007B0AF]
More?

Id: [0x0007B0B0]
Bring a Bottle.

Id: [0x0007B0B1]
I'd see some Colour first.

Id: [0x0007B0B6]
She's eighty Guns or more!

Id: [0x0007B0BA]
Stop!

Id: [0x0007B0BB]
I don’t want to hurt you!

Id: [0x0007B0BC]
[Groan of pain.]

Id: [0x0007B0BD]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0007B0BE]
Hold her there. There’s only one place left it could be. I'll get it out of her.

Id: [0x0007B0CA]
Nevermind. I will be more careful next time.

Id: [0x0007B0D3]
Which way did he go?

Id: [0x0007B0DE]
Levers and platforms... The tower is full of tricks and mysteries.

Id: [0x0007B0DF]
What does this do?

Id: [0x0007B0E3]
Push!

Id: [0x0007B0E4]
Pull!

Id: [0x0007B0E5]
Now!

Id: [0x0007B0E6]
Stop!

Id: [0x0007B0E7]
Where shall my wondering soul begin? How shall I all to heaven aspire? A slave redeemed from death and sin, A brand plucked from eternal fire, How shall I equal triumphs raise, Or sing my great deliverer's praise.

Id: [0x0007B0E8]
Listen- the Doctor.

Id: [0x0007B0E9]
You go ahead. I'll climb around the other way. We'll flank him.

Id: [0x0007B0EC]
You deceived me.

Id: [0x0007B0ED]
Did I?

Id: [0x0007B0EE]
Your charm is no artifact. It does nothing!

Id: [0x0007B0F1]
Its magic is not for you.

Id: [0x0007B0F7]
Why not set a Powder Keg for more boom?

Id: [0x0007B0F8]
Drag a Powder Keg over there.

Id: [0x0007B0FB]
Fire a Snapper at that Keg!

Id: [0x0007B0FC]
Blast a Keg!

Id: [0x0007B106]
They're coming from Everywhere!

Id: [0x0007B1DB]
Go on.

Id: [0x0007B1DF]
Ah!

Id: [0x0007B1E2]
A bit wide of the Mark, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007B1E4]
He's got one last Chance to remember where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x0007B1E6]
[Laughing.]

Id: [0x0007B1EA]
I'll catch you up.

Id: [0x0007B1F3]
Rest and repast while you can, Kenway. It's a long way to Nassau.

Id: [0x0007B1F7]
Which one of you Scabs drank my breakfast!

Id: [0x0007B1FA]
Mmmh

Id: [0x0007B20A]
!*[pain grunt]

Id: [0x0007B20D]
!*[Laugh] Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007B211]
!*It may be he remembers where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x0007B213]
!*[Laughing.]

Id: [0x0007B217]
!*I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007B21A]
Uncork this man some Breakfast, will ye[Laugh]?

Id: [0x0007B21C]
We give awards for top-notch employees doing quality work.

Id: [0x0007B21D]
And they're nice to have, since there's no official bonus scheme here.

Id: [0x0007B21E]
I already have about eleven or so-

Id: [0x0007B220]
Oh... [FR][Bonjour?](Hello?)... Of course ... I'll pass it on.

Id: [0x0007B223]
Well... looks like Olivier wants to meet with you. It's exciting!

Id: [0x0007B225]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0007B227]
It's on the top floor, so it's not hard to find.

Id: [0x0007B228]
But the rest of this building can be confusing to first-timers, so we had the tools team whip up a great Map application...

Id: [0x0007B229]
Check your communicator. I added a waypoint to Olivier's office.

Id: [0x0007B22D]
It should be easy to find.

Id: [0x0007B231]
There you go. See there?

Id: [0x0007B238]
Olivier's a nice guy. He won't bite.

Id: [0x0007B246]
We met earlier. I was calibrating your Animus. I'm sort of the, uh... Scotty of this Abstergo enterprise ... in charge of all the techie stuff.

Id: [0x0007B249]
You're better at this than I'd hoped. Now zip on down to the lobby. Come on!

Id: [0x0007B24A]
Anyway, the courier should be waiting downstairs. She's been here a while.

Id: [0x0007B24E]
The couriers are waiting on you.

Id: [0x0007B250]
I'd deliver that package myself but I'm deep into some database coding.

Id: [0x0007B252]
It's a bit rude making the couriers await.

Id: [0x0007B254]
What are you, some kind of diva? Go see the courier!

Id: [0x0007B256]
You're just being ridiculous now.

Id: [0x0007B258]
Man, I cannot wait to write your performance evaluation next year. Less than satisfactory.

Id: [0x0007B267]
Hey, I just got word the courier has come and gone. Wonderful. You're a miracle.

Id: [0x0007B269]
No, no, no that's an exaggeration. You're not a miracle. You're an employee. Doing a job.

Id: [0x0007B26A]
But thanks for helping out.

Id: [0x0007B27D]
On the Roofs!

Id: [0x0007B284]
I'll take care of this one!

Id: [0x0007B28E]
Ah, A little Help would be nice!

Id: [0x0007B28F]
Remember me? Your bleeding Friend?

Id: [0x0007B2A5]
[SP][Acérquese, tengo el mejor ron de los mares del Sur.](Step right up! Finest Rum in the South Seas!)

Id: [0x0007B2A6]
[SP][Sí, usted. ¿Qué desea?](Yes, you sir, what'll it be?)

Id: [0x0007B2A8]
That's not a bad Start.

Id: [0x0007B2AA]
Let's take the Guards on the Rooftops first.

Id: [0x0007B2AB]
Don't hold back, Rhona.

Id: [0x0007B2B4]
Good. Let's move on. No Time to lose.

Id: [0x0007B2B6]
If he rings that Bell, we're done for.

Id: [0x0007B2B9]
Great. Let's get out of here. Day's a wasting.

Id: [0x0007B2BB]
That was a great bit of Sport. Hope it helps.

Id: [0x0007B2BC]
Mark my words, I'll find that Man and destroy him.

Id: [0x0007B2BD]
"Destroy." Is that what you're calling it now?

Id: [0x0007B2BE]
So will you, if you want your Key.

Id: [0x0007B2BF]
I suppose I've done stranger.

Id: [0x0007B2C4]
Oh, He won't be hard to find, the cheeky Bastard, strutting about like the Cock of the Walk.

Id: [0x0007B2C5]
Admit it, Rhona. Deep down, you like the walk of that Cock.

Id: [0x0007B2C6]
Of course it's not the same here as Home in England, but there's a Wild quality I've come to enjoy.

Id: [0x0007B2D4]
Hey Flint!

Id: [0x0007B2D5]
You should know, Dinsmore.

Id: [0x0007B2E3]
The charm he took belonged to my mother. It gave her strength and foresight, as it did her mother before her. As it did me. Without it, I am blind.

Id: [0x0007B2E4]
You will have it back soon. I will make sure of it.

Id: [0x0007B2E8]
Ah!

Id: [0x0007B2E9]
[Sharp gasp of surprise]

Id: [0x0007B2EB]
Sorry.

Id: [0x0007B2EC]
Sorry.

Id: [0x0007B2ED]
[brief embarassed laugh]

Id: [0x0007B2EE]
[brief annoyed snort]

Id: [0x0007B2F1]
Excellent.

Id: [0x0007B301]
The White Jaguar! A fine Catch. You have more than proven yourself. We accept your Help.

Id: [0x0007B302]
With what?

Id: [0x0007B303]
[Beat] Look!

Id: [0x0007B306]
[Sigh]Typical. Twist a Templar Blade to our Back to play Savior to our Face.

Id: [0x0007B307]
Look, I'll level with you, Lass.[Beat] I'm also looking for a Key. I figure I help you, you let me keep the Key if it turns up.

Id: [0x0007B309]
Right. You're offended. I'll go.

Id: [0x0007B30D]
Easy. Let's go.

Id: [0x0007B315]
I've got some Idea.

Id: [0x0007B317]
[SP][¡Hola!](Hello!)

Id: [0x0007B31F]
Let's see where this Lad goes.

Id: [0x0007B323]
I know she's here, Lucia Marquez. I can feel it.

Id: [0x0007B333]
Come Lucia, is this not what you want?

Id: [0x0007B334]
Your Father was never such a Coward!

Id: [0x0007B335]
Even alone I am stronger than all of your Men.

Id: [0x0007B345]
Hello, Hellooooooo. Do you have a second? Of course you do.

Id: [0x0007B347]
I'd like to link all the cameras in the building to a central monitoring system, but most aren't calibrated correctly.

Id: [0x0007B349]
Head to the waypoint on your map. I have another job for you.

Id: [0x0007B34E]
Another locked door. Not a problem.

Id: [0x0007B352]
Find the camera control station first.

Id: [0x0007B357]
-and if we want information on Assassins or Templars or the Observatory, or whatever the fuck else interests us, Olivier, you will deliver it. Full stop.

Id: [0x0007B358]
I understand that, Laetitia. I'm sorry if that came out wrong. We're not trying to be a bottleneck here. But we just don't have the resources right now to do two times the research.

Id: [0x0007B359]
Finding that balance is your priority. Your entertainment products are simply a means to pay the bills for larger and more important work. That's the way the world works, hm? Dirty money buys clean hospitals. You get it?

Id: [0x0007B35B]
We're on-board, Laetitia, rest assured. We have our best employee working on this. But it will take time.

Id: [0x0007B35C]
Good. And thank you. The both of you. I look forward to seeing what you deliver. Until then, I'll see you at the shareholders meeting, Olivier.

Id: [0x0007B35D]
Looking forward to it. Bye bye.

Id: [0x0007B35E]
Tabarnak![Pause] It's a little too early for that kind of abuse.[Beat] Come on.

Id: [0x0007B367]
Ah, I'm hurt!

Id: [0x0007B374]
Of course not![After a beat.] I just don't want you to feel like I'm telling you what to do.

Id: [0x0007B375]
I think that Injury must have left you with a touch of Fever.

Id: [0x0007B376]
[Breaths]Can we go now?

Id: [0x0007B377]
Edward, we've reduced that Templar cad, Flint, to a fraction of his Power. The only thing standing between you and your Key now is Flint himself.

Id: [0x0007B378]
You have an Approach in Mind?

Id: [0x0007B379]
Let's.

Id: [0x0007B37A]
I'll distract him. You circle around for the Kill.

Id: [0x0007B380]
What did you find out?

Id: [0x0007B381]
Managed to nab a Pickpocket. Sly Boots had a Map. Something about Storehouses and Gunpowder.

Id: [0x0007B382]
That's the same Name from the Map.

Id: [0x0007B383]
He's using Pickpockets to run an Arms Race.

Id: [0x0007B387]
Were you successful?

Id: [0x0007B388]
I kept overhearing this Name - Marquez.

Id: [0x0007B389]
[gasp]

Id: [0x0007B38A]
Friend of yours?

Id: [0x0007B38F]
He's getting away!

Id: [0x0007B394]
Stop them before they harm our Target!

Id: [0x0007B399]
She must be hiding. Let's take some Action she can't ignore.

Id: [0x0007B3B3]
And then he dismissed me. Without Pay! For Drunkenness!

Id: [0x0007B3B4]
Alleged Drunkenness.

Id: [0x0007B3B5]
All's I had to do was escort the Man North, no South, no. North. Definitely North.

Id: [0x0007B3BE]
They're holding the Cur nearby.

Id: [0x0007B3BF]
Whatever for?

Id: [0x0007B3C1]
I wouldn't linger here. The Walls have Ears, if you know what I mean.

Id: [0x0007B3C2]
Are we followed?

Id: [0x0007B3C3]
We must warn the Others!

Id: [0x0007B3D0]
[Effort Sounds while grabbing the enemy]You've got the Information I need, mate.

Id: [0x0007B3D1]
No![Heavy Breaths, panting] I've heard of your Kind... Ass- Assassin. Don't hurt me.

Id: [0x0007B3D2]
All I want to know is where this Slave is. Do you know of anyone being held... [a beat][note: By definition there are no free slaves. All of them are captive. So Edward needs to ask about slaves being held under special circumstances. Hence the pause before he chooses the word: "specially."] specially Like?

Id: [0x0007B3D3]
Please! Let me live. My Wife and Children--

Id: [0x0007B3D4]
Come on then, out with it.

Id: [0x0007B3D5]
Look near the Windmill.

Id: [0x0007B3D6]
See, was that so hard?

Id: [0x0007B3DB]
Ah, Aileen. Didn't see you come in.

Id: [0x0007B3E9]
I have now resumed the practice of dressing as a man, and have put off my woman's dress.

Id: [0x0007B3EB]
No no no... come on, Satish. Not you.

Id: [0x0007B3EC]
It wouldn't be permanent. A few months at most.

Id: [0x0007B3ED]
Months! That will kill every ounce of momentum we have!

Id: [0x0007B3EE]
It won't, I promise. Honestly, I think this could help us. If I can get a look at what his people are doing, we could-

Id: [0x0007B3EF]
Come on. He's try to pull you over to his side. You don't see that? He's luring you with quick victories and prestige.

Id: [0x0007B3F0]
That's not what this is about, honestly.

Id: [0x0007B3F1]
Aileen, I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0007B3F2]
Do what you must. I'll survive.

Id: [0x0007B3F3]
So... the main reason I asked you here concerns something called The Observatory. It's been mentioned a few times in the footage you found.

Id: [0x0007B3F4]
I'd like to encourage you to focus on locating this specific set of memories as soon as possible.

Id: [0x0007B3F5]
If it were up to me, [FR][on s'en crisse](we don't care)...  I wouldn't bother. But some bigwigs at Abstergo Industries have been hounding me for days.

Id: [0x0007B3F6]
So follow whatever leads you find, and hopefully we can a-

Id: [0x0007B3F8]
Incoming call. I have to take this.

Id: [0x0007B3FA]
[FR][Allen, bonjour. Oui. Oui, tout va bien. Naturellement.](Allen, hello. Yeah. Everything is fine. Of course I do.)

Id: [0x0007B3FC]
[FR] [Oui.](Yes.)

Id: [0x0007B3FD]
[FR] [D'accord.](Right.)

Id: [0x0007B3FE]
[FR][Oui, oui Bien sûr.](Yes, yes Of course.)

Id: [0x0007B3FF]
[FR] [Bon, d'accord.](Well, sure.)

Id: [0x0007B400]
[FR] [Pas vraiment.](Not really.)

Id: [0x0007B401]
[FR] [Pourquoi ?](Why?)

Id: [0x0007B402]
[FR] [Je ne sais pas si…](I can't really say...)

Id: [0x0007B405]
Don't give up on me, Caroline![Pause] Not when I need your Faith the most...

Id: [0x0007B409]
So, this is the Sample 17 floor. We're diving into the memories of one very Generous donor, Desmond Miles.

Id: [0x0007B40A]
We're pulling all the best stuff from his DNA... and hopefully, one day we can forge some fantastic experiences from what we find in there.

Id: [0x0007B40F]
Welcome to Animus Omega, Abstergo Entertainment's proprietary Ancestral Memory Research tool.

Id: [0x0007B410]
You have been registered as part of the SAMPLE 17 project. Your primary research target is EDWARD JAMES KENWAY. BORN MARCH 10 1693. SWANSEA, WALES.

Id: [0x0007B415]
If you have any questions, comments or concerns about how to operate your Animus console, please contact your Project Supervisor, MELANIE LEMAY.

Id: [0x0007B41C]
Calibrations complete. All signs normal, all systems optimal. Extra-neural Transmitters activated.

Id: [0x0007B425]
So I reviewed some of your data. Pretty raw stuff! Obviously we need to scrub off some of the dirt to make it family friendly.

Id: [0x0007B426]
Maybe give Edward a voice like James Bond or something. More of a ladies man.

Id: [0x0007B429]
Hey you. Do have a minute? I'm on my way upstairs.

Id: [0x0007B42A]
Olivier wanted to talk with us about putting together a trailer using some of the footage you've been recording this past month.

Id: [0x0007B42C]
Take your time. I'll meet you by the elevator.

Id: [0x0007B42F]
I just watched some of your footage from this week. It's amazing. Blackbeard was mental!

Id: [0x0007B430]
And we all got so excited that we started talking about this idea for a trailer about him... maybe start with him drinking, talking to some pirates, telling a story...

Id: [0x0007B431]
Then, we cut to him leaping across the deck of his boat and- Sorry, his ship. Not boat.

Id: [0x0007B432]
But jumping around the deck of his ship, swinging from ropes, and fighting like a Devil. I mean, obviously we'll have to manipulate some of the existing footage to get it looking good but-

Id: [0x0007B433]
It could be great. I'm getting a shiver in me timbers just thinking about it.[Laughs] Sorry.

Id: [0x0007B44E]
So... what's next?

Id: [0x0007B451]
[Laughing] Assassins. Templars... crazy talk.

Id: [0x0007B453]
Sounds like crackpot stuff, I know. But then again, the moon landing was faked, right? So anything's possible.

Id: [0x0007B45E]
You can't waltz into Olivier's office through the front door, so I've opened another route.

Id: [0x0007B46F]
You're not Sweet on him, are you?

Id: [0x0007B4A8]
What do you want, Englishman?

Id: [0x0007B4A9]
Edward Kenway. I'm here to warn you of Danger. [Beat]And I'm Welsh.

Id: [0x0007B4AC]
You all look the same to me. Why should I need your Warning? My life is all Danger.

Id: [0x0007B4AD]
I may have brought it on you.

Id: [0x0007B4AE]
[Laughing]This means you owe me.

Id: [0x0007B4DA]
I found your Men.

Id: [0x0007B4DB]
And I found where his Brothers are kept. Help me release them.

Id: [0x0007B4DC]
No, Mate. I've settled my Debt. Meddling with slaves is none of my Affair. I doubt there’s even a Templar behind it at all.

Id: [0x0007B4DD]
All affairs of freedom are Assassin affairs.

Id: [0x0007B4E0]
What is your Price?

Id: [0x0007B4E1]
What?

Id: [0x0007B4E2]
A Man without principle must be moved by Coin. How much do you need?

Id: [0x0007B4E3]
There is a Key I’m looking for. Belongs to a Set I’ve been stripping off Templars.

Id: [0x0007B4E4]
The Templar Keys? I thought they’d been destroyed.

Id: [0x0007B4E5]
I’m not the only one who knows about them, then?

Id: [0x0007B4E6]
If we find it, it's yours.

Id: [0x0007B4E7]
You have a Deal. Let’s go get your Friends.

Id: [0x0007B4E9]
Slaves, you mean?

Id: [0x0007B4EA]
Brothers, Warriors, the Hope of the Maroons.

Id: [0x0007B4EB]
Doesn't sound like my Business, Mate.

Id: [0x0007B4EC]
All I need is for you to mingle with your Countrymen. Listen to Hints for where my Friends are held.

Id: [0x0007B4ED]
Fine.[Beat] I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x0007B4F5]
Hurry! To my Bureau.

Id: [0x0007B507]
Where to, next?

Id: [0x0007B508]
That’s enough Work for one night. Or do you grow fond of it?

Id: [0x0007B509]
That’s it? No Templar? What about the Key?

Id: [0x0007B50A]
The Templar did not show himself. You will have your Key next Time.

Id: [0x0007B50B]
No, Antó, there is no next Time.

Id: [0x0007B50C]
When you discover your Conscience or admit how badly you want the Key, there will be a next Time.

Id: [0x0007B50E]
You returned. Have you brought your Conscience?

Id: [0x0007B50F]
I want... my Key.

Id: [0x0007B510]
Patience is a Virtue.

Id: [0x0007B512]
Expecting Company?

Id: [0x0007B513]
You may have your Key sooner than you think. Help us defend the Bureau. The Men we freed will help.

Id: [0x0007B53B]
Oh these Templars. They run our lives, you know?

Id: [0x0007B540]
[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007B541]
Consider it motivating.

Id: [0x0007B542]
That's not fair.

Id: [0x0007B57E]
They decide elections, they control various capital markets, and they inject us with little microchips to track our movements and read our thoughts.

Id: [0x0007B581]
[SP][¡Eh, al ladrón!](Hey! Thief!)

Id: [0x0007B5A0]
What I miss the most is the Fox Hunt.

Id: [0x0007B5A1]
Of course, there's plenty of other Game to be found. One needs only be creative.

Id: [0x0007B5A2]
I like mine with Teeth.[Beat] The chase is more fun when the Prey bites back.

Id: [0x0007B5A3]
I hope you feel well. You look good.[Beat] Can you stand?

Id: [0x0007B5A9]
Attack!

Id: [0x0007B5AC]
It is too quiet. I do not trust it. There will be more of them.

Id: [0x0007B5AD]
Remain alert, men! More will be coming.

Id: [0x0007B5AE]
Edward! Eliminate as many as you can before the next Wave!

Id: [0x0007B5BC]
Edward, I am glad you showed up when you did. I’m sorry I have no Key to give you, but-

Id: [0x0007B5BD]
No. The Key can wait.[after a beat] Whoever did this, I want to teach him a Lesson.

Id: [0x0007B5BE]
The Templar’s Name is Kenneth Abraham. He's part of an ongoing War with the Maroons. But we have held strong, and will not be defeated.

Id: [0x0007B5BF]
Let me devise a Plan.

Id: [0x0007B5C1]
I have a Plan but it won't be easy. Abraham is well connected and his Pockets are deep. But we have located a Man in his inner Circle. We will tail him until he reveals our Target.

Id: [0x0007B5C3]
Here he comes now.

Id: [0x0007B5C6]
Evening.

Id: [0x0007B5C7]
Sir.

Id: [0x0007B5C8]
Pleasant night for a Ball.

Id: [0x0007B5CA]
Now, if you'll excuse me. I have a private Matter to attend before I make my Entrance.

Id: [0x0007B5CB]
As do I.

Id: [0x0007B5CC]
We will see you there.

Id: [0x0007B5CE]
Good Evening. Will the Commander be in attendance tonight?

Id: [0x0007B5CF]
Yes, I was just speaking with him. He is here somewhere.

Id: [0x0007B5D0]
Yes, I just left him. Hard to spot in his dress Uniform.

Id: [0x0007B5D3]
[Pained]Antó. How many Years have we fought? Your Men, in the Mountains, with no Weapons to speak of. And my army, resplendent. And yet you live, and I die...

Id: [0x0007B5D6]
[A last dying breath]

Id: [0x0007B5DA]
You lacked the Conviction to win.

Id: [0x0007B5E5]
[Fight Grunt]

Id: [0x0007B5E6]
Look up.

Id: [0x0007B5E7]
Down.

Id: [0x0007B5E8]
Right.

Id: [0x0007B5E9]
And left...

Id: [0x0007B5ED]
I'll let you do the honors. We're headed up to the Sample 17 studio. Second floor.

Id: [0x0007B5EE]
Not fixing. Calibrating.

Id: [0x0007B5FC]
[FR][Bonjour!](Hello!)

Id: [0x0007B601]
This is all yours, so sit back, relax, and find us some good footage.

Id: [0x0007B60C]
Is something wrong?

Id: [0x0007B60D]
Olivier said to go right in.

Id: [0x0007B60E]
You're not nervous are you? He's a very nice guy.

Id: [0x0007B60F]
Go on in.

Id: [0x0007B643]
Now, you need to bypass the core to find the data inside. Once you reach it, your communicator will download it automatically.

Id: [0x0007B644]
This is how you control the program in the core.

Id: [0x0007B645]
You need to find your way around the core to reach the data inside.

Id: [0x0007B646]
Once you move your program, it will remain intact until it reaches an obstacle or until you find the core.

Id: [0x0007B649]
Hey. You ready?

Id: [0x0007B64A]
Over here. Olivier's waiting on us.

Id: [0x0007B64B]
If you need to use the toilet first, make it snappy.

Id: [0x0007B64C]
Good to go?

Id: [0x0007B651]
[Laughs.]

Id: [0x0007B654]
Travers?

Id: [0x0007B655]
What Tide brings you? You dress the part of an Assassin, yet I don't know your Face.

Id: [0x0007B656]
Name’s Kenway. I'm here to warn you of a Threat to your Bureau.

Id: [0x0007B659]
Yes, I have noticed some suspicious Men lurking about. I believe they work for a noted Templar, called Upton. Could you... eliminate them for me?

Id: [0x0007B65A]
Oh, I may be persuaded, for a Price. You wouldn't happen to know anything about a Templar Key, would you?

Id: [0x0007B65B]
I'm sure you can find it among Upton's men, IF I tell you where they are.

Id: [0x0007B65C]
[Sigh to approve]You've got yourself a deal.

Id: [0x0007B673]
Who sent you? Why are you dressed like that, Templar?

Id: [0x0007B675]
I’m no such thing.

Id: [0x0007B676]
You’re no Assassin. I run the bureau. I’d know you if you were one of us.

Id: [0x0007B677]
That's rich. I've met the leader. You’re not him!

Id: [0x0007B678]
[Out of breath]Stop! I am Upton Travers. Bureau leader.

Id: [0x0007B67E]
My blood brother! We work together.[Beat] And those were not Templars that you killed! They were my workers!

Id: [0x0007B67F]
Don't blame me. Your brother ordered it.

Id: [0x0007B683]
Does he mean to usurp me?

Id: [0x0007B684]
I don't know mate, I'm only after a Templar key.

Id: [0x0007B685]
A what? [after a beat] Please, I need for you to tell me everything.

Id: [0x0007B687]
And why should I trust you?

Id: [0x0007B688]
Meet me at the bureau. And I will show you.

Id: [0x0007B68D]
What?[Beat] Is Vance your...

Id: [0x0007B691]
[Sigh]Bother.

Id: [0x0007B697]
My lovesick idiot of a brother has misled you.

Id: [0x0007B698]
[With a weary sigh] Start from the start, mate.

Id: [0x0007B69B]
Recently, our trade introduced us to a formidable woman- Jing Lang, a pirate from the farthest seas of the Orient.

Id: [0x0007B69C]
Intriguing.

Id: [0x0007B69D]
She and Vance quickly became inseparable.

Id: [0x0007B69E]
Any reason he should have thought your men were spies?

Id: [0x0007B69F]
Well, there is the treasure.

Id: [0x0007B6A0]
Oh?

Id: [0x0007B6A1]
A pirate sold us a map. We each kept half.

Id: [0x0007B6A9]
Come. I will meet him now. If you follow with discretion, you may hear it for yourself.

Id: [0x0007B6BA]
Good day, my brother.

Id: [0x0007B6BB]
Good day, "brother" if I may still call you that.

Id: [0x0007B6CC]
Idiots! You're all Idiots!

Id: [0x0007B6CD]
How you English believe you can subdue the World is beyond me!

Id: [0x0007B6CF]
Ah! Praise God for imported Wines.

Id: [0x0007B6D0]
Who can drink Rum more than once a Month?[IT][Mio Dio](My God)! It is revolting.

Id: [0x0007B6D2]
There is no Beauty to this City. No Expression of Joy. No aesthetic Plan! Ugh.

Id: [0x0007B6D3]
You walk your Streets like Animals! Like Cattle with no sense of Decorum!

Id: [0x0007B6D5]
Damn this sweltering Heat. Another Quaff, I think.

Id: [0x0007B6D6]
Ah! That hits the right Note. Mm... Sangiovese, the finest Grape in the World.

Id: [0x0007B6D8]
Bastardo! Now I am lost! How preposterous this City is! All straight Lines and rigid Blocks, and still no sense of Order!

Id: [0x0007B6D9]
Oh, how I miss the warm and winding Streets of Firenze! How I miss Culture!

Id: [0x0007B6DB]
Almost out of Wine.

Id: [0x0007B6DC]
I pray this Party is well stocked. For if they have only Rum and Molasses Cakes, I will assassinate the Host.

Id: [0x0007B6E5]
Good god man, what's happened to you?

Id: [0x0007B6E6]
I cannot go on anymore! My brother: a traitor. That woman... Templar. I have no family! No wife of my own! What is the point of living, hm? Let them kill me.

Id: [0x0007B6E7]
You don't know what you're saying mate. Let's get you some place safe.

Id: [0x0007B6E8]
What's the point?

Id: [0x0007B6E9]
The point is, I want my key, so I need you alive. I need your information, so I need you sober.

Id: [0x0007B6EA]
[Hard time breathing]You are my best friend. C'mere; I'll kill you.[Struggling grunts]

Id: [0x0007B6EB]
Come on mate, let's go.

Id: [0x0007B6EC]
No!

Id: [0x0007B6F9]
What are you looking at?

Id: [0x0007B6FA]
Hey, you there, with the sour Face. What's that you said about Mah maw?

Id: [0x0007B701]
The church! In the name of the father, the son, and the holy--

Id: [0x0007B703]
Let's just keep it moving, yeah?

Id: [0x0007B707]
Who are these creatures?

Id: [0x0007B70F]
Ahhh, that's much better.

Id: [0x0007B718]
Safety is an illusion. But yes, I have friends here. I can hide.

Id: [0x0007B719]
What you must think of me. Have I said anything embarrassing?

Id: [0x0007B71B]
Betrayal makes one philosophical, don't it?[Beat] Imagine. A templar. My brother to marry a Templar.

Id: [0x0007B71D]
I doubt it'll come to that.

Id: [0x0007B720]
Sober up mate. We'll finish this in the morning.

Id: [0x0007B72B]
[Effort Sounds, panting]I'm asking for a friend: do you know anything about some slaves held captive or whatnot?

Id: [0x0007B72C]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0007B72D]
Don't matter, mate.

Id: [0x0007B72E]
Get off me. I don’t know what you're on about.

Id: [0x0007B72F]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x0007B731]
Alright, alright.

Id: [0x0007B74D]
Officers, may I join you?

Id: [0x0007B74E]
Evening.

Id: [0x0007B74F]
The more the merrier.

Id: [0x0007B750]
The Prat was right under our Noses the whole Time!

Id: [0x0007B783]
Aveline, do you still call yourself Assassin? Whatever name you take, you came to me for help once and now I must ask the same of you.

Id: [0x0007B784]
There is a girl of uncanny strength and wit: Patience Gibbs. She is accused of leading a slave revolt, and her master has placed a high price on her capture. She is a hunted girl.

Id: [0x0007B785]
I have attempted to recruit Patience for the Brotherhood, but she will not allow me to approach her with help. Your name is legendary among the slaves, even as far North as Newport, I believe you will have more success. She was last seen on Goat Island. Start your search there, if you accept.

Id: [0x0007B786]
Your Friend and Brother, Connor.

Id: [0x0007B787]
Post-script: Take care to heed the fort, and Patience herself. I have learned the hard way; she is dangerous when startled.

Id: [0x0007B78D]
State your business!

Id: [0x0007B793]
[brief panicked shout]

Id: [0x0007B7A5]
What happened here?

Id: [0x0007B7A6]
We all escaped together. She helped us. She said a ship would come. But they found us.

Id: [0x0007B7A7]
Patience Gibbs. Our camp was just beyond that hill, but they ransacked it, and took us prisoner. They must be holding her there.

Id: [0x0007B7AF]
[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007B7B0]
[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007B7B6]
Hurry up!

Id: [0x0007B7BB]
[Pained breath]Traitor!

Id: [0x0007B7BC]
It takes one to know one.

Id: [0x0007B7C0]
Jing Lang, as I live and breathe!

Id: [0x0007B7C9]
Really?

Id: [0x0007B7CA]
[Pained breath]Yes. I stole the real one. Both halves. My husband has it.

Id: [0x0007B7CB]
Your husband? [after a beat].

Id: [0x0007B7CD]
Imagine. The Queen of Pirates, Jing Lang, defeated for a fake map. I have been arrogant.[Pain short grunt]

Id: [0x0007B7D0]
As I sobered up, I began to see it more clearly. Jing has led my brother astray, and must be killed.

Id: [0x0007B7D1]
A better man than these fools.[A Dying Breath]

Id: [0x0007B7DB]
We must find her, draw her out, and put a final End to her.

Id: [0x0007B7DD]
Yes. Eliminate these Men.

Id: [0x0007B7DE]
Help me kill these Men.

Id: [0x0007B7E2]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0007B7E7]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0007B7E8]
At last.

Id: [0x0007B7E9]
Thanks.

Id: [0x0007B7ED]
Let's Uncork that poor fella some Breakfast, eh?

Let me bring him to his End.

Id: [0x0007B7F0]
I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007B7F1]
Pleasant Night to celebrate impending Victory.

Id: [0x0007B7F6]
I said she's a lovely woman. Inside and out.

Id: [0x0007B7F9]
So either way, one of them has the Templar key. You're obviously distraught. Let me take care of it.

Id: [0x0007B7FE]
I will tell you where to find them.

Id: [0x0007B800]
hm, You're looking better than last we met.

Id: [0x0007B802]
But Vance has also betrayed me. As an Assassin his treachery must be punished by death.

Id: [0x0007B80C]
Aesop once wrote of an Eagle, soaring high above a Shepherd's Field, that swooped down on powerful Wings to seize a grazing Lamb and carry it off to her Nest.

Id: [0x0007B80D]
Flying close by, a Jackdaw saw the Deed, and it filled his Head with the Idea that he too was just as strong and capable.

Id: [0x0007B80E]
So, with a great flapping and rustling of Feathers, the Jackdaw came down swiftly and clutched at the Coat of a large Ram.

Id: [0x0007B80F]
But when he tried to fly away, he found he could not lift the Animal, for his Size and Strength were not up to the Task.

Id: [0x0007B810]
And even as the Jackdaw struggled, the Ram hardly noticed he was there.<CR>

Id: [0x0007B811]
Nearby, just across the Field, the Shepherd saw the fluttering Bird and was quite amused.

Id: [0x0007B812]
Running up, he captured the Jackdaw and clipped its Wings.

Id: [0x0007B813]
That Evening he gave the Jackdaw to his Children as a Gift.<CR>

Id: [0x0007B814]
"What an odd little Bird this is, Father!" they laughed and shouted. "What do you call him?"<CR>

Id: [0x0007B815]
"This is a Jackdaw," the Father said. "But if you should ask him, he would claim to be an Eagle."

Id: [0x0007B82A]
I warned you-- I always know what you'll do, a second before you do.

Id: [0x0007B830]
This never would have happened if I still had the ch--

Id: [0x0007B833]
What's that?

Id: [0x0007B834]
You did not think I'd give up all my secrets so easily?

Id: [0x0007B835]
I'm learning not to. But how--

Id: [0x0007B839]
Does it work? It lets me see.

Id: [0x0007B83A]
Into m-

Id: [0x0007B83B]
Minds? No- into all things. Only for a few seconds, anyway.

Id: [0x0007B83C]
Long enough-

Id: [0x0007B83D]
-to escape.

Id: [0x0007B840]
Will this do?

Id: [0x0007B844]
That's my Prize, Roberts. Give it here!

Id: [0x0007B847]
Give it here!

Id: [0x0007B84A]
That's right, Boy! Take it!

Id: [0x0007B84B]
I'll sweeten you, Maggot! I'll cut you down!

Id: [0x0007B852]
Don't you dare give him Jaw!

Id: [0x0007B85A]
Roberts!

Id: [0x0007B85E]
Welcome aboard, Kenway! It's Prizes, Plunder and Adventure ahead. Are you Game?

Id: [0x0007B85F]
Outta my way, Ben.

Id: [0x0007B864]
We was told Nassau was a Place where Men could live and drink and fuck as they please!

Id: [0x0007B865]
Save keeping Others from doing the same.[Effort and struggling sounds till exit]

Id: [0x0007B869]
What Man with a sensible Mind would choose the former Life?

Id: [0x0007B86C]
Ah... you've Art and Wisdom for the Business of Piracy... but you haven't the Will needed to take it to a Conclusion!

Id: [0x0007B873]
Duncan Walpole, lately arrived! Yet just in time to hear a Tale.

Id: [0x0007B874]
Where is he? Where's Roberts?

Id: [0x0007B875]
Go on, Captain Rogers. Tell us.

Id: [0x0007B876]
Where's he gone!

Id: [0x0007B878]
As Gentlemen of Fortune we enjoy Plenty and Satisfaction, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power...

Id: [0x0007B879]
For I have dipped my Hands in muddied Waters, and withdrawing them find 'tis better to be a Commander than a Common man!

Id: [0x0007B87A]
No more than two Years! You promised me-

Id: [0x0007B87B]
You left! When I needed you the most.

Id: [0x0007B87C]
But you had me!

Id: [0x0007B87D]
I'm so close, Caroline! Please! Just let me do this!

Id: [0x0007B883]
Do you know where Judge is taking your charm?

Id: [0x0007B884]
My best bet is the Newport Tower. This tunnel will lead us there.

Id: [0x0007B89E]
We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x0007B8A0]
[Laughs]Were it not for Rum and Reales, we might have been Heroes, eh Kenway?

Id: [0x0007B8A4]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x0007B8AD]
'Pon my honour.[Beat] Let me know if you find Anything.

Id: [0x0007B8B6]
Try the Key you took from Du Casse.

Id: [0x0007B8B8]
That's one. Only four left.

Id: [0x0007B8B9]
Aye. It might be that these four Templars have them. See the Names here?

Id: [0x0007B8BD]
Not a nice way to kick off. But that is some damn fine Gear.

Id: [0x0007B8CB]
Now's the Time.

Id: [0x0007B8CC]
No. Not until we see the Sage.

Id: [0x0007B8F7]
Hello?

Id: [0x0007B8F8]
Aileen, hi. It's Karl.

Id: [0x0007B8F9]
Karl, I know it's you.

Id: [0x0007B8FA]
Sorry. You just... you sound exhausted. Did I wake you?

Id: [0x0007B8FB]
No... no, I'm... I've just been busy.

Id: [0x0007B8FC]
It sounds like it.

Id: [0x0007B8FD]
I'm just a little tired. That's all.

Id: [0x0007B8FE]
No, I mean... your project sounds fascinating. Your colleague, Doctor... Warren Vidic?... he called me recently and told me a what you'd been up to.

Id: [0x0007B8FF]
He what? Warren?

Id: [0x0007B900]
Yeah, he told us about your research. Memories. Ancestry. All that. He even asked if we'd be willing to come in and-

Id: [0x0007B901]
No! Jesus, no! What the hell is he doing?

Id: [0x0007B902]
Aileen. It's okay. We signed some papers... non-disclosure stuff.

Id: [0x0007B903]
No! He's trying to fuck me over. Dammit!

Id: [0x0007B904]
Aileen, we just talked about my mother. Just like you and I did. World War two. That's all.

Id: [0x0007B905]
It's the artifact.

Id: [0x0007B906]
The what?

Id: [0x0007B907]
Karl, if he calls again, you tell him you work through me, okay? That's it. Vidic has been a pain in my ass for years. And I don't need him getting all the glory for my two years of hard work.

Id: [0x0007B908]
All right. So... how should I go about this? I mean... the wheels are in motion.

Id: [0x0007B909]
I... I don't know. Just go through me if he contacts you again. Please.

Id: [0x0007B90A]
All right.

Id: [0x0007B90B]
You'll do that?

Id: [0x0007B90C]
Of course. Yes.

Id: [0x0007B90E]
Thank you Karl. I'm sorry I was short with you. I've just been... exhausted. That's all.

Id: [0x0007B90F]
It's all right, hon. Just... just take care of yourself.

Id: [0x0007B911]
[tape pops on, Vidic Clears his throat.] All right... notes towards a speech in honor of Dr. Aileen Bock's premature... retirement.[Pause, speechfying] When I first learned of Dr. Bock's unfortunate accident, I couldn't help but feel a great sense of loss at... [Beat] No... [Beat, starting over]

Id: [0x0007B913]
Blackbeard made you as good an Offer as ever a Man got from any Pirate.

Id: [0x0007B915]
You should have Bartered, Mate.

Id: [0x0007B916]
Uncork this Man's Breakfast!

Id: [0x0007B91C]
Morning Aileen. We're almost ready. Just a few more adjustments.

Id: [0x0007B91D]
Hm. Okay.

Id: [0x0007B91E]
I had the team do some research on this artifact we've been chasing, and it appears the Third Reich actually found something matching it's description sometime in nineteen-forty...

Id: [0x0007B920]
Aileen, are you all right?

Id: [0x0007B921]
Sorry, yeah. I'm fine... just a little, uh... scattered.[Beat] Vidic called my ex-husband last night. He wants to put him in the Animus.

Id: [0x0007B924]
To find the artifact before us...

Id: [0x0007B925]
Exactly.

Id: [0x0007B929]
Well... it would be faster using Vidic's animus. And maybe that would let us get back to our original work.

Id: [0x0007B92A]
Satish, if we let that happen, then all our money dries up. Lillian is paying us to find the artifact, not improve our methods. Do you understand?

Id: [0x0007B92B]
Right... of course.

Id: [0x0007B92C]
I'm sorry. Let's just... let's burn those bridges when we cross them. Are we ready?

Id: [0x0007B92D]
Yeah. Just a few adjustments and you're in. I made a small change to the Genetic input modulator. I'm hoping that buys you a few more minutes.

Id: [0x0007B92E]
Even a few seconds would be nice. I'm ready...

Id: [0x0007B92F]
All right. Settle in...

Id: [0x0007B935]
[laughing]I see it so clearly now. They didn't break, did they? You have nothing!

Id: [0x0007B936]
Quiet, girl.

Id: [0x0007B937]
You don't have the artifact. If you did, you wouldn't be talking to me at all!

Id: [0x0007B939]
Quiet!

Good Morning, Captain Kenway. I have a Gift for you.

Id: [0x0007B959]
Captain's aboard! Man all Canvas! Let's move!

Id: [0x0007B95C]
Close but no Catch, Captain!

Id: [0x0007B966]
You walked me Blind and Backwards into this Mess, Kidd! Who the hell was that Jester back there?

Id: [0x0007B967]
I saved your Skin bringing you Here, Man. These Men wanted you dead for what you did in Havana. I talked 'em out of it.

Id: [0x0007B971]
Ah Tabai, an Assassin. And my Mentor.

Id: [0x0007B97B]
So it's you Lot them Templars have been chasing, then?

Id: [0x0007B97D]
So you're all part of some daffy Religion?

Id: [0x0007B98B]
Ah... Captain Kenway. I'm assuming this is the friendliest Face you've seen since dropping Anchor?

Id: [0x0007B98C]
Is Havana under Curfew on my Account?

Id: [0x0007B98D]
Hm, aye. Torres seems to think someone's coming after him.

Id: [0x0007B98E]
He's not wrong...

Id: [0x0007B98F]
That's... that's by the Church.

Id: [0x0007B991]
You're done, Torres.

December twenty-third, twenty twelve. Sample Recovery Unit Team-Lead Fisher Case reporting on Subject Seventeen, Desmond Miles.

Id: [0x0007BC53]
The subject displayed burns to the right hand, severe enough to fuse the bones, indicating some kind of spontaneous, intense burn trauma. [he momentarily sounds a little shaken or grossed out] Honestly, we have never seen anything like it before. Head, neck and torso remained in good condition.

Id: [0x0007BC54]
I hand-selected recovery agents to retrieve fluid samples- blood and saliva.

Id: [0x0007BC56]
Data analysis and sequencing is already under way, and I'm told, proceeding with exceptional ease.

Id: [0x0007BC5B]

What's your name, Pillock? Kenmore? Conway?

Id: [0x0007BDB9]
It's Walpole, ain't it?

Id: [0x0007BDBB]
Walpole? Where'd you get that?

Id: [0x0007BDBC]
That's the Rumor going 'round. As dirty and daft a Pirate as ever sailed these West Indies.

Id: [0x0007BDBE]
Well, whatever his Name, you're to make sure he suffers without dying. Orders from the Governor.[beat] And back to the Prisons at sundown.

Id: [0x0007BDC0]
And massage his Feet if he's aching, shall I?

No Idea where. [she is seized by a pain]<br>Ah![she grabs her belly]

Id: [0x0007BE1D]
[Trembling with the pain]

Id: [0x0007BE21]
[Breathing out with pain]What's happened to Mary? What's wrong?

Id: [0x0007BE23]
Is she gone?

Id: [0x0007BE36]
Oh, no... Oh, God![Pained grunt]

Id: [0x0007BE38]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x0007BE3A]

We had some initial concerns about interference in the vault but but given the skill and talent of this team, we were able to capture useful data.

Id: [0x0007BE81]
The Subject was deceased and unattended. Time of death was placed around zero-hundred hours and seven minutes, with conditions favorable for DNA sample recovery.

Id: [0x0007BE93]
I personally retrieved the subject's backpack, and extracted a number of objects of interest, to undergo detailed analysis.

Id: [0x0007BEA4]
Thanks to the cloud database and the work of Abstergo Sample Recovery Unit 3, the legacy of Subject Seventeen will continue uninhibited as Sample Seventeen.

Id: [0x0007BEA5]
We then commenced material extraction, and were able to preserve several exemplary samples.

Id: [0x0007BF5B]
Okay. Everything's sorted out. Meet me when you're ready.

When you receive a new objective, have a quick peek at your communicator. It's as easy as that.

Id: [0x0007BFA5]
Do have a minute or... ah, dammit. The tracker says you're on your way to Olivier's office.

Id: [0x0007BFA6]
[Annoyed sigh] All right. I'll ping you when you're done. I have a favor to ask.

Id: [0x0007BFA8]
And please be snappy. Before I find a reason to hate you too.

Id: [0x0007BFAA]
Sorry. Cloud servers are offline for a few minutes while I do some... uh... maintenance. But they'll be back online as soon as you run my errand. Get it?

Id: [0x0007BFAD]
A locked door. Not a problem.

Id: [0x0007BFAF]
That's the advantage of me having Level 1 security clearance. Now you do too!

Id: [0x0007BFB0]
Don't abuse it.

Id: [0x0007BFB3]
Log on and I'll walk you through this.

Id: [0x0007BFB5]
See... that file you acquired... I wouldn't recommend watching it. I mean, you could... but it's unpleasant. So once you hand it off, just pretend this never happened. Okay?

Id: [0x0007BFB6]
Otherwise, you'll just go to bed feeling sad.

Id: [0x0007BFB8]
I suppose it goes without saying... just because you know how to hack all your colleagues' computers, it doesn't mean you should.

If you need to use the toilets they're just here, on the right.

Id: [0x0007BFDE]
Might be a few newspapers laying around too.

Id: [0x0007BFDF]
Head to the right of Olivier's office. If the receptionist complains, act like you're using the toilets.

Id: [0x0007BFE2]
If we're low on toilet paper just give me a shout, okay?

Id: [0x0007BFEC]
Ok, this may be tricky. You need to move some sensitive data around.

Id: [0x0007BFED]
Be careful now. As the data moves, there are security programs constantly monitoring the data flow. You need to sneak past them or they will destroy your data and send it back home.

Id: [0x0007BFEF]
It works!

Id: [0x0007BFF0]
Aha...

Id: [0x0007BFF3]
I'm curious about this shareholders meeting though. How about you break into Olivier's office and see if you can find his schedule?

Id: [0x0007BFF4]
Oh, what? You don't like that idea? Well how about I blow the fucking whistle on you, hacker! I OWN YOU!

Id: [0x0007BFF6]
[Laughs quietly]What I mean is... I don't want to ruin your life. So do as I say.

Id: [0x0007BFF7]
Now, step over to the window.

Id: [0x0007BFFA]
Go to the window. NOW!

Id: [0x0007BFFB]
You want me to keep you locked in here forever? Until security finds you? Go to the window!

Id: [0x0007BFFC]
Did you know that Abstergo was run by Templars? Oh yes.

Id: [0x0007C000]
All right... either you walk through that door, or throw yourself off the terrace. Those are your options.

Id: [0x0007C004]
Oh, well done, kiddo!

Id: [0x0007C005]
Find his computer. Make it snappy.

Id: [0x0007C00C]
You sneaky bastard. A pirate through and through, aren't ya?

Id: [0x0007C00D]
Now get down to the lobby. There's a courier waiting.

Id: [0x0007C00E]
[Laughs]That's right... I've been planning this for a few hours.

Id: [0x0007C011]
Now, wait. The receptionist. Hold on. I'll try something.

Id: [0x0007C027]
Hey there. I just got a call about picking up another transfer.

Id: [0x0007C028]
Aw. You said you were here to see me.

Id: [0x0007C029]
Yes, That IS one of the perks.[to the player] Let's see it.

Id: [0x0007C02C]
Hm. A conference in Chicago. Very nice.

Id: [0x0007C02E]

Id: [0x0007C034]
We'll keep you safe. Trust me.

Id: [0x0007C03B]
Rest assured, we will compensate you when the hacker is found.

Id: [0x0007C03C]
I can't wait to show the work we've done with your stuff. Take care.

Id: [0x0007C040]
Did you hear that? I think I just gave you Level 3 security clearance!

Id: [0x0007C044]
...there's no need for you to be down here by yourself, Miss Lemay. My team will handle the investigation.

Id: [0x0007C045]
But you need extra eyes on this thing, John. We don't even know when the hackers broke in. It could take weeks to go through this data.

Id: [0x0007C047]
Still too long. I can't keep my team locked up for a week.

Id: [0x0007C048]
Legally you CAN. It's what they signed up for. Even if they didn't read their contracts.

Id: [0x0007C049]
Yes, of course. I just hate the idea. [Beat] So what's the next step?

Id: [0x0007C04C]
My team is processing the data now. We'll start sifting through it tonight. Scout's honor.

Id: [0x0007C053]
All right, I ditched her at the coffee stand.

Id: [0x0007C055]
Find the server containing the network logs.

Id: [0x0007C056]
Since I have a record of each and every one of your hacks, we'll just search for the timestamps on those, and turn that data into something harmless.

Id: [0x0007C058]
Here we are! Beautiful. I'll update your communicator one more time. A little program I cooked up, just for this purpose.

Id: [0x0007C059]
There we go. I think that worked.

Id: [0x0007C05A]
Try it out.

Id: [0x0007C05E]
Make me whole again, my children. My instruments. Bring me forth to fulfill your purpose.

Id: [0x0007C05F]
TELL ME!

Id: [0x0007C060]
She should be here! Now! Living in that god damned head of yours!

Id: [0x0007C069]
[Laughs] I wish I could explain all this strangeness, but there isn't much time. The short of it is, you saw my beloved Juno. And for a brief moment I thought she might occupy this tender body of yours.

Id: [0x0007C06B]
But something went wrong. And now she's back out there. Adrift.

Id: [0x0007C06C]
They created your kind. Did you know that? Your people were tools to them. That’s all you have ever been. That's all you should ever be!

Id: [0x0007C08E]
After you! We have work to do!

Id: [0x0007C09C]
There you go.

Id: [0x0007C09D]
Nice.

Id: [0x0007C09E]
Not quite.

Id: [0x0007C09F]
I set up a database for any data you find. Just look for the "My Files" section in your communicator and you'll be redirected right away.

Id: [0x0007C0A9]
Voila! You now have level 2 security clearance. Not bad for your first few weeks.

Id: [0x0007C0AE]
We're looking for the Shareholder's meeting schedule. It's worth a lot of money to us.

Id: [0x0007C0B6]
Don't even think about ratting me out. My tracks are covered. Yours ain't.

Id: [0x0007C0B7]
Where the hell are you going? Get down to the lobby.

Id: [0x0007C0B8]
GO TO THE LOBBY! NOW!

Id: [0x0007C0B9]
Go on back to work. We'll be in touch.

Id: [0x0007C0FA]
That means you!

Id: [0x0007C0FB]
We do as the lady says. Focus on the Observatory.

Id: [0x0007C0FE]
I know this seems excessive, but with our high-level security clearance, we have an obligation to our shareholders.

Id: [0x0007C102]
I'd wipe these servers myself, but as the head of IT, I'd be a suspect. It has to be someone they've already locked up.

Id: [0x0007C104]
It's all very scary.

Id: [0x0007C107]
All right, Listen. I'm entering the server room now. When you see us leave, get in there.

Id: [0x0007C109]
One at most.

Id: [0x0007C10E]
I've marked the server for you, numbskull. Are you that dense?

Id: [0x0007C112]
Excellent. Now you can remotely hack the computer containing the log files.

Id: [0x0007C6A2]
Easy as that.

Id: [0x0007C6A3]
Hurry!

Id: [0x0007C6A4]
What's taking you so long?

Id: [0x0007C6A6]
I'm sorry for your Loss.

Id: [0x0007C6A7]
You are a Fighter, aye.[Pause] In Prison, I heard Stories of the infamous Anne Bonny and Mary Read, taking on the King's Navy together. Just the Pair of you.

Id: [0x0007C6A8]

Id: [0x0007C6A9]

Id: [0x0007C6AA]

I do.[Pause] Devil curse me, I do.

Hello!

Bloody good work earlier. Honestly, I mean it. Delivering us all that data. It's really just too bad our man on the inside was such a... uh, how how how to put it, fanatic, fanatic is the best word, I suppose.

Id: [0x0007C6F8]
We take who we can get!

Id: [0x0007C6F9]
Exactly. Exactly. Well put. We saw in John an opportunity to burrow deeper into Abstergo's cloud servers, and I am not ashamed to say, we took it... uh, not realizing of course that he was enlisting you to help him. And to blame, should anything go wrong.

Id: [0x0007C6FA]
I suppose it all worked really nicely in the end. Most of it, anyway.

Id: [0x0007C6FB]
What Shaun really wants to say is... if you're up for more hacking, we are too. John gave you level 3 security clearance before he died. You should use it.

Id: [0x0007C6FC]
The Assassins don't have the resources to pay you like the Templars do. But we'll make it worth your while.

Id: [0x0007C6FD]
Ah, look, we should really cut it short, Bex. Twenty seconds.

Id: [0x0007C6FE]
Ah, right.... Good luck!

Id: [0x0007C6FF]
Cheers Mate. And top notch work, really top, give yourself a pat on the back. And... happy hacking.

Id: [0x0007C709]
So what keeps you pushing forward on this Path, eh? Wouldn't the Assassins be a finer fit to your Temperament? Wouldn't they share your Love for a less painful Liberty?

Id: [0x0007C70C]
You know nothing of me, Roberts. Nothing.

Id: [0x0007C721]
Go on, try it out.

Id: [0x0007C722]
Are you having trouble with your communicator?

Id: [0x0007C726]

Look on that, Captain. Men who ran the same Gauntlet, and lost their Way.

Id: [0x0007C801]
[PT][Que raio é que se passa aqui?](What the Hell is going on up here?)

Id: [0x0007C807]
We've been spotted... took them long enough.

Id: [0x0007C809]
To Quarters All! Man the Cannons, every last Hand!

Id: [0x0007C80B]
On your Command, Captain. Let's hear the Roar of this Beast!

Id: [0x0007C81B]
Here's my Prize!

Id: [0x0007C823]
So what do you think?

Id: [0x0007C824]
It'll take some getting used to.

Id: [0x0007C82C]
The second Attack this month. I should have moved this Village long ago.

Id: [0x0007C82E]
I brought all this upon you Years ago. But I will stand by you now.

Id: [0x0007C82F]
It will take more than a few Favours to call yourself a true Assassin, Edward.

Id: [0x0007C831]
One thing at a Time, Mate.

Id: [0x0007C838]
Hold! Stand your Ground!

Id: [0x0007C839]
Please, I've been shot! I need Aid.

Id: [0x0007C83A]
Christ, Thompson, look at her. She's hurt.

Id: [0x0007C83B]
[Pain while breathing]Dreadfully, Sir. I'm poorly and faint.[Heavy Breaths]

Id: [0x0007C83C]
All right.[Pause] Take an Arm, Lass.

Id: [0x0007C852]
Is everything you do out of Spite, Edward?

Id: [0x0007C853]
It's not Spite that's driving me Mary. It's Courage!

Id: [0x0007C854]
[to himself]God damn you all! [loudly] I can handle this!

Id: [0x0007C855]
You Lout! Always tearing down when you could be building things up. Or Building yourself up, if nothing else!

Id: [0x0007C85B]
I said Quiet, Whore!

Id: [0x0007C85C]
NAVAJOS LAY SIEGE!

Id: [0x0007C85E]
Quiet! Quiet! QUIET!

Id: [0x0007C85F]
[Screams]Ah! NAVAJOS! NAVAJOS LAY- Ah! [Etc.]

Id: [0x0007C863]
[Screaming]

Id: [0x0007C864]
Get her out! Get her out!

Id: [0x0007C865]
[Screaming]

Id: [0x0007C866]
We're losing her!

Id: [0x0007C867]
Shut it down! Everything!

Id: [0x0007C868]
[Moaning]

Id: [0x0007C869]
Aileen! Open your eyes! Can you hear me? Aileen! Aileen!

Id: [0x0007C86A]
Power's off!

Id: [0x0007C86B]
Get the Physician in here!

Id: [0x0007C86C]
Step aside, son.

Id: [0x0007C86D]
Aileen! Talk to me! Can you open your eyes? Oh God... oh God...

Id: [0x0007C870]
Doctor Aileen Bock has and always will be a friend and colleague. When I first learned of her unfortunate accident, I was shocked of course. To see any friend injured in such a way is deeply upsetting. And to further learn that her injuries were severe enough to force a premature conclusion to her brilliant career... well, I would not wish that fate on anyone. [Pause] But if... if there is any solace to be found in her accident, it may be this: that she was injured in service of her research... in service of work that she cherished most dearly.

Id: [0x0007C871]
And it is thanks to her... [Pause] it is due to her diligence, that some of the mysteries of genetic memory have been further illuminated. And while it is true that work on her project - the Surrogate Initiative, as she called it - has been temporarily halted, the copious amounts of work she has done over the past three years has been incredibly valuable... so, while her work has been suspended for the time being, her legacy will most certainly... live on. [Pause... Vidic laughs lightly... then sighs... then falls silent.]

Id: [0x0007C874]
Quiet, Joan! Quiet!

Id: [0x0007C876]
Quiet!

Id: [0x0007C878]
Why did you take it? Who made you take it!

Id: [0x0007C879]
I took it of my own free will. With no constraint: I prefer a man's dress to a woman's.

Id: [0x0007C87A]
You made an oath, Jeanne! You swore to never again dress as a man!

Id: [0x0007C87B]
I never meant to swear that I would not RESUME the practice.

Id: [0x0007C87C]
Why have you done so?

Id: [0x0007C87D]
Because it is more lawful and suitable for me to return to the practice of wearing a man's dress - being always among men - than to have a woman's dress. I have resumed it because a promise made to me has not been kept...

Id: [0x0007C882]
There you go.

Id: [0x0007C884]
Yeah, look... I don't care what it tastes like, mate. That is a bloody Cappuccino. That is the button I pressed.

Id: [0x0007C885]
Yes, hang on, please.

Id: [0x0007C886]
Latte for Steven![FR][Un latte.](A latte.) Steven?

Id: [0x0007C887]
[mumbling to himself]What a crap detail, my God. Shoot me now.

Id: [0x0007C895]
Don't be shy!

Id: [0x0007C896]
Come check out the view.

Id: [0x0007C899]
A beautiful city, no?

Id: [0x0007C89B]
Up to the penthouse! Yeah?

Id: [0x0007C8A9]
Coffee's on me, Okay?

Id: [0x0007C8D4]
Good. Try walking around.

Id: [0x0007C8D6]
A doctor came by. Said there wasn't anything to worry about. That the liquid in that syringe was far, far below a lethal dose.

Id: [0x0007C8D7]
I feel terrible about all this. About everything. All our evidence pointed to you... but it was John all along.

Id: [0x0007C8D8]
God, the things we found on his computer.[Desperate breath]

Id: [0x0007C8D9]
Whatever you need, we'll provide. You've done an amazing job.

Id: [0x0007C8DA]
Speaking of which! Our trailer is finished. Would you like to see it?

Id: [0x0007C8DC]
I owe you that much.

Id: [0x0007C8DE]
There we go. I uploaded it to your database. You can watch it here, or at your Animus.

Id: [0x0007C8DF]
I think you'll love it. It really captures the... the essence of the era.

Id: [0x0007C8E1]
So- Take care. And again... thank you.

Id: [0x0007C994]
[Pain Grunt]

Id: [0x0007D29C]
Leaving already?

Id: [0x0007D29D]
All right, Rackham. Back to Retirement.

Id: [0x0007D692]
[Running Breaths.]

Id: [0x0007D6A1]
[Effort grunts and panting]

Id: [0x0007D6A3]
You all right?

Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 32. April 2nd, 1981. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x0007D6AC]
Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 37. August 9th, 1981. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x0007D6AF]
Well, let me be the first to reassure you: this will not happen. I will NOT let them take this from me. From us. I will not let one death... of an undiagnosed epileptic, I should add... I will not let this destroy the decades of incredible research done by our predecessors, and the five years I have spent perfecting the Animus. There is still more work to be done. And countless rewards to be reaped. So... I wanted you to be the first to know... I have decided to volunteer myself as my second subject. I am convinced that the Animus is perfectly safe, provided I stay within the boundaries of my own ancestral bloodline. Next week I plan to prove this by staying a full FOUR hours in the Animus.

Id: [0x0007D6B0]
I would be grateful to you if you and your team would monitor my progress. And after this necessary but ridiculous proof of concept, I give you my word that I will work closely with you to solve your outstanding problems. Your Surrogate Initiative is a bold idea, and I do believe it is the future of the Animus project. But while we have the Animus itself, I do not want to waste precious opportunities to prove its safety. [beat] I’ll see you in the office on Monday. Goodbye.

Id: [0x0007D6C2]
Caroline, come away! Don't exert yourself.

Id: [0x0007D6C5]
The Jackdaw then.

Id: [0x0007D6C6]
Excellent!

Id: [0x0007D6CB]
Here's a quiet Spot. I'll see the Money.

Id: [0x0007D716]
Hands where I can see 'em, Lad!

Id: [0x0007D718]
Ah! Ah... Duncan?

Id: [0x0007D719]
Edward.

Id: [0x0007D71A]
Oh, Right. Edward... I thought you'd been shunted back to England.[beat] Without saying goodbye.

Id: [0x0007D71B]
Not exactly. I found some Trouble I couldn't fix. So I Thought it best to move on. So what's brought you to this rough shores?

Id: [0x0007D71C]
[Sigh]A failing Business, sadly. The Competition has toughened as of Late. And here one of the Beckfords' Men has just cut me out of a tidy Profit. Three Weeks sailing, and my Hands are empty.

Id: [0x0007D71D]
Beckfords... as in the Beckford sugar Plantation?

Id: [0x0007D71E]
Oh my... you've- got a natural way of authority, Edward. I wish I could say the same. I've since come to learn that the costume does not make the man. Not in the least.

Id: [0x0007D720]
You can't play it halfway, Stede. You go the distance, or you go nowhere.[Beat] That's your choice.

Id: [0x0007D733]
The very same. I think he's around. Haughty chap. Probably talking loudly about his gains as we speak.

Id: [0x0007D734]
Well, if he's still here, I'll see that he gets his comeuppance for treating you so ill.

Id: [0x0007D735]
Aye, in the midst of a Hurricane.

Id: [0x0007D736]
Just before the Treasure Fleet was smashed against the Shore.

Id: [0x0007D737]
Don't get squeamish, Kenway. Don't let 'em scare you!

Id: [0x0007D749]
What's our Course, Thatch?

Id: [0x0007D74A]
Bearing up, then. Sou-Sou-East.

Id: [0x0007D74E]
Was the Haul aboard as rich as Men are saying?

Id: [0x0007D752]
That's a comfort.

Id: [0x0007D758]
Easy as she goes. No telling what you may find out here.

Id: [0x0007D759]
Don't soil your Breeches, Lads. I got this.

Id: [0x0007D802]
You haven't earned these, but[Beat] they suit you.

Id: [0x0007D806]
I don't know, Jim. I haven't the faintest Idea how to pilot a Ship. That ain't work a Woman does.

Id: [0x0007D807]
Tosh! I've seen a Score of Ladies who can reef a Sail and spin a Capstan.

Id: [0x0007D808]
And would you teach me to fight? With a Cutlass, like? And maybe handle a Pistol?

Id: [0x0007D809]
All that and more. But you have to want it. And work for it. There's no stumbling into true Success.

Id: [0x0007D80A]
Oy! Lad! That's my Lass you're making Love to! You lay off or I'll cut ya!

Id: [0x0007D80C]
You have a bold Idea. But I must think it carefully through.

Id: [0x0007D80D]
[Hooting and Hollering.]

Id: [0x0007D80E]
Up your Arse, Rackham. Lad is the last thing you should be calling me.

Id: [0x0007D811]
A simple Pledge of Loyalty is all you need suggest to the House of Commons. An Oath, a Gesture, and a simple ceremonial Dram of Blood taken from the Finger. That's all.

Id: [0x0007D812]
The Ministers may give me Trouble, but it should be easy enough to convince the House of Lords. They do adore an Excess of Pomp and Circumstance.

Id: [0x0007D813]
Exactly.[Beat] Tell them it's a Show of Fealty to the King... against those revolting Jacobites.

Id: [0x0007D814]
The crucial Detail is the Blood. You must get a Sample from each Man. We want to be ready when we find the Observatory.

Id: [0x0007D81B]
The men Native to this Land will put up a fight, Edward. Are you willing to push back If necessary? To kill if needed?

Id: [0x0007D81C]
You'll hear from me soon.

Id: [0x0007D81F]
Well done.

Id: [0x0007D820]
Are we close, God dammit?

Id: [0x0007D823]
Innocent or no, they stand between us and our Object. Why sympathize beyond this Fact?

Id: [0x0007D824]
I didn't come to slaughter innocent Men, Roberts.

Id: [0x0007D827]
I had hoped to find you here. Well spotted, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007D828]
Is this the Observatory? All this?

Id: [0x0007D829]
...and the Door opens, after almost eighty-thousand Years.

Id: [0x0007D82C]
I can't take this no more! Jaysus, I can't!

Id: [0x0007D82E]
What the hell is all this! Oh God!

Id: [0x0007D82F]
Help!

Id: [0x0007D830]
God help me!

Id: [0x0007D831]
Ah!

Id: [0x0007D832]
Get me out of this place! Please!

Id: [0x0007D836]
Jaysus Roberts! Have you gone Mad?

Id: [0x0007D837]
But you, ah... I suspect you're made of sterner Stuff.

Id: [0x0007D83A]
Step as if on thin Ice, Captain.

Id: [0x0007D83F]
Look at this Place!

Id: [0x0007D840]
Beautiful, isn't it?

Id: [0x0007D841]
Aye. Like something out of a Fairy Tale, or one of them old Poems.

Id: [0x0007D842]
There were many Stories about this Place once. Tales that turned into Rumours, and again into Legend. The inevitable Process of Facts becoming Fictions, before fading away entirely.

Id: [0x0007D843]
The more you talk, Man, the less I understand.

Id: [0x0007D844]
I don't expect you to.

Id: [0x0007D845]
It may be again, one Day. But not in this Epoch.

Id: [0x0007D859]
I be needin' coin to set up the shipyard Cap'n. The faster I have the needful gold, the sooner our ships will rule the waves!

Id: [0x0007D868]
A curious Bunch.

Id: [0x0007D887]
Oh! Oh, is that right, is it? LAD!

Id: [0x0007D888]
Let's try another. Governor Woodes Rogers.

Id: [0x0007D889]
Yes. Indeed.

Id: [0x0007D88A]
Ah, these Templars.

Id: [0x0007D88B]
Agreed.

Id: [0x0007D88D]
[pain breath]Roberts!

Id: [0x0007D88E]
[pain breath]I'll gut you!

Id: [0x0007D88F]
[Pained scream]

Id: [0x0007D894]
How resourceful!

Id: [0x0007D895]
[Laugh]He fights as a Devil in Sailor's Rags!

Id: [0x0007D896]
Wonderful!

Id: [0x0007D897]
Mary was fond of you, Edward. She saw something in your Bearing that gave her Hope you might one Day fight with us.

Id: [0x0007D898]
Aye, she told me.

Id: [0x0007D899]
And what do you think of our Creed?

Id: [0x0007D89A]
It's hard to say. For if Nothing is true, then why believe Anything? And if Everything is permitted... why not chase every Desire?

Id: [0x0007D89B]
Why indeed?

Id: [0x0007D89C]
Here now. Arm yourself with this. The Sheng Biao... a gift from our Chinese Brothers and Sisters, one we now pass to you.

Id: [0x0007D905]
[Cheers]

Id: [0x0007D916]
Do you all hear that?

Id: [0x0007D922]
Where the hell is Kenway?

Id: [0x0007D923]
Note the day, lads! Today we send the King's finest to their graves!

Id: [0x0007D932]
I'll not play duck and drake with ye Cap'n, I need coin to build a little emporium. I'd be ever obliged... and a local shop would bring in many a useful ware for ye as repayment.

Id: [0x0007D94A]
It will be when he sends his Soldiers to scrub this Island clean of our Residue! Look around you, Man. Is this Cesspool worth dying for?

Id: [0x0007D94B]
Aye! It's our Republic! Our Idea! A free Land for free Men, Remember?

Id: [0x0007D995]
So maybe it's filthy to look at. But it ain't it still an Idea worth fighting for?

Id: [0x0007D998]
Aye, Nassau may look fine from a Distance, but at its Core there's a Disease I cannot Stomach.

Id: [0x0007D99A]
Sickness can be cured, Ben. If only you have the right Medicine.

Id: [0x0007D99B]
But a Corpse cannot be reanimated!

Id: [0x0007D99C]
I can't believe the Shite I'm hearing drop from your Lips! Why not take the Pardon now and be done with it!

Id: [0x0007D99D]
Peace! Both of you. We can satisfy both Aims if we work together. Find Medicines to ease our Burden's here, but in a Way that don't attract the British.

Id: [0x0007D99E]
The Spanish Fleet that sunk two years back would have some Medicine. All sealed up in glass Vials.

Id: [0x0007D99F]
You'd need a diving Bell to reach those Depths.

Id: [0x0007D9A0]
Aye. And with some Coin and a few Supplies, a Diving Bell won't be hard to come by.

Id: [0x0007D9A1]
This is a plan I can stand behind. Find Medicines without stirring up Trouble. Agreed, Thatch?

Id: [0x0007D9A2]
Agreed, aye. I'll meet you near the Wrecks as soon as you're able, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007DAB9]
We're Assassins and we follow a Creed, aye. But it does not command us to act or submit... only to be wise.

Id: [0x0007DABA]
Oh do tell. I'd love to hear it.

Id: [0x0007DABB]
"Nothing is true, Everything is permitted." This is the world's only Certainty.

Id: [0x0007DABE]
"Everything is permitted?" I like the Sound of that. Thinking what I like, and acting how I please.

Id: [0x0007DABF]
You parrot the Words... but you do not understand them.

Id: [0x0007DAC2]
Don't get haughty with me, Kidd. I followed you as a Friend, and you tricked me.

Id: [0x0007DAC3]
Well cheers for that.

Id: [0x0007DAC4]
Aye. Cheers.

Id: [0x0007DAC7]
Until you came along and mucked Things up, it was us chasing them. We had them running scared. But they have the upper Hand now.

Id: [0x0007DACE]
It might be that this Idea is only the beginning of Wisdom, and not its final Form.

Id: [0x0007DACF]
That's quite a step up from the Edward I met here many Years ago.

Id: [0x0007DAD7]
[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x0007DADA]
[Laugh]Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007DADE]
It may be he remembers where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x0007DAE0]
[Laughing.]

Id: [0x0007DAE3]
I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007DAE7]
Let's Uncork that poor fella some Breakfast, eh?

Id: [0x0007DAED]
We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x0007DAEF]
[Laughs]It's not the first time Kenway and it won't be the last.

Id: [0x0007DAF2]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x0007DAF9]
[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007DAFA]
[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007DAFB]
[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007DAFD]
That's gonna hurt.

Id: [0x0007DB0F]
Day-olds! Get your Day-Olds!

Id: [0x0007DB10]
Day-old fish! Perfect for Bait or... more Bait!

Id: [0x0007DB11]
Day-old Fish!

Id: [0x0007DB12]
The worst Fish at the best Price!

Id: [0x0007DB14]
Old Fish! Going fast!

Id: [0x0007DB16]
["bleugh" grossed out going-to-puke sound, after smelling stinky fish]

Id: [0x0007DB17]
Disgusting!

Id: [0x0007DB19]
Yurrhhh...

Id: [0x0007DB1A]
I'm going to be Sick!

Id: [0x0007DB1B]
The Smell!

Id: [0x0007DB1E]
The whole thing! Says who?

Id: [0x0007DB1F]
Alvin. He showed me the bill of sale. Earned enough for the month, in a single day! And he'll do it again tomorrow when he delivers it to their Headquarters.

Id: [0x0007DB2C]
Get out of Sight.

Id: [0x0007DB2D]
Conceal yourself.

Id: [0x0007DB2F]
Hurry! Keep after him!

Id: [0x0007DB30]
Don't let him get away!

Id: [0x0007DB31]
Don't sink him!

Id: [0x0007DB32]
We need the Man and the Ship intact.

Id: [0x0007DB33]
If he drowns we'll lose Marquez!

Id: [0x0007DB35]
We've got him! Board his ship!

Id: [0x0007DB36]
Board him, and make him talk!

Id: [0x0007DB37]
What are you waiting for? Board it!

Id: [0x0007DB39]
Keep the Target alive! Don't let him see you.

Id: [0x0007DB3A]
The Target's no good to us dead!

Id: [0x0007DB3B]
My enemies! Help me fight them.

Id: [0x0007DB3C]
Look up!

Id: [0x0007DB3D]
Behind you!

Id: [0x0007DB3E]
Help me!

Id: [0x0007DB3F]
Use a Powder Keg!

Id: [0x0007DB4B]
Is it your Aim to destroy the last of my Kind? Here I am. Come get me.

Id: [0x0007DBC4]
I've got more than enough Powder to take care of them.

Id: [0x0007DBC5]
Use a Keg.

Set the Keg where they'll least expect it.

Id: [0x0007DBC7]
Suprise them with a Powder Keg.

Id: [0x0007DBC8]
Take a Keg. Set a Trap.

Id: [0x0007DBC9]
Set a trap with Powder Kegs!

Id: [0x0007DBCC]
Fire at the Powder Keg!

Id: [0x0007DC1E]
There's a strong Wind now. Let's strike to Full, shall we?

Id: [0x0007DCC2]
Bless you, Lads.

Id: [0x0007DD37]
I don't believe you.

Id: [0x0007DD38]
Go ask down at the Piers. He's the talk of the town.

Id: [0x0007DD3A]
Your whole Catch? You must have made a Fortune.

Id: [0x0007DD3B]
You see! Alvin is practically Nobility now!

Id: [0x0007DD3C]
Ah! A noble Fisherman. Indeed.

Id: [0x0007DD3D]
We're coming with you.

Id: [0x0007DD3E]
More are coming. Take them out. Corner her. Make her fight alone.

Id: [0x0007DD3F]
Lucia, come. Don't keep us waiting.

Id: [0x0007DD40]
You cannot hide forever.

Id: [0x0007DD41]
Confront us now, confront us later; there is no escaping either way!

Id: [0x0007DD42]
We're right here Lucia. Waiting for you. Come out!

Id: [0x0007DD43]
They'll come from the Back.

Id: [0x0007DD44]
They're coming from the Left.

Id: [0x0007DD45]
Cover the Right Entrance.

Id: [0x0007DD46]
Look up!

Id: [0x0007DD47]
Those big guys are slow, but deadly. Powder will take Care of them.

Id: [0x0007DD48]
Use the Powder Barrels on those Brutes.

Id: [0x0007DD49]
Those brutes are tough, but they're no Match for a Powder Barrel.

Id: [0x0007DD4A]
Keep away from those Brutes if you can. Let the Powder Barrels take Care of them.

Id: [0x0007DD4C]
They're coming from the Rooftops!

Id: [0x0007DD4D]
I'm hit!

Id: [0x0007DD4E]
[cry of agony]

Id: [0x0007DD4F]
A little Help, please!

Id: [0x0007DD50]
Take out the Rooftop Guards first.

Id: [0x0007DD53]
Any man's Senses can be tuned well past what he's born with. If he tries.

Id: [0x0007DD5C]
Make sure he doesn't ring for Reinforcements.

Id: [0x0007DD5D]
Let's use their own Powder Kegs against them!

Id: [0x0007DD5E]
Let's fight Fire with Fire!

Id: [0x0007DDB8]
A Shimmering.

Id: [0x0007DDBB]
Go on, Man. Focus!

Id: [0x0007DDBC]
Look through the Darkness.

Id: [0x0007DDBF]
Ah! Right. I know this Feeling. I have since I was a Lad.

Id: [0x0007DDC0]
It's like using every Sense at once, isn't it? To see Sounds and hear Shapes. Quite a Combination.

Id: [0x0007DE21]
You've ruined me, Bastard!

Id: [0x0007DE28]
Damn you, Man! Relent, and and you'll have a Handsome reward!

Id: [0x0007DE29]
You think I could trust a posh Dab like you. The man who murdered my Captain and drowned my crew?

Id: [0x0007DE2C]
[Death cry, quick]

Id: [0x0007DE2E]
IF I must die, I'm taking you with me!

Id: [0x0007DEE5]
Hah! Not much of a Shot, are you, Flint?

Id: [0x0007DEE6]
[laughter] I should, after studying you for so long.

Id: [0x0007DEE7]
Then you finally admit your Obsession with me!

Id: [0x0007DEE8]
And how many Men have you sent after me, just this week, Flint?

Id: [0x0007DEE9]
What did you expect? That I would come in Person? You overestimate your Importance.

Id: [0x0007DF13]
You're a Pig, Flint.

Id: [0x0007DF14]
Oh... don't be stroppy, Dinsmore.

Id: [0x0007DF15]
Oh, Don't be such a Beard-Splitter.

Catch-fart.

Id: [0x0007DF1A]
Stop! I'm blushing.

Id: [0x0007DF1B]
Oh, you make me Ill.

Id: [0x0007DF1C]
Ah, that's right Flint, retreat! I like a Man who knows his Place.

Id: [0x0007DF1D]
Is that what you tell all the Lads at the Punch House?

Id: [0x0007DF1E]
I would but you always beat me to it.

Id: [0x0007DF22]
We're stealing a Brig.

Id: [0x0007DF23]
Won't be a Minute.

Id: [0x0007DF3C]
We're following a bit close, don't you think?

Id: [0x0007DF3E]
Quiet!

Id: [0x0007DF40]
You don't mind me tagging along, do you?

Id: [0x0007DF46]
Can't they kill the Bastard? Ain't been a good Hanging for Months. Not since Rackham got his.

Id: [0x0007DF47]
Eh, hard to understand how it works. I've heard it said they scooped up Captain Vane near a Year ago, and he's not seen the end of a Rope.

Id: [0x0007DF48]
I can't fathom it, I really can't. Some Men [Beat] they stretch after Days of Capture. Others they sit on.

Id: [0x0007DF49]
Maybe he has Friends looking out for him.

Id: [0x0007DF4A]
Or Money. Like Stede Bonnet from Barbados.

Id: [0x0007DF4B]
Naw, naw. They hanged him too.

Id: [0x0007DF4C]
Did they?

Id: [0x0007DF4D]
Aye. Blubbering and bawling, he collapsed at the Gallows. Weeping like a little Lamb.

Id: [0x0007DF4E]
[Laugh]Serves the Bastard right.

Id: [0x0007DF51]
Oy! you stop that!

Id: [0x0007DF53]
This is a Warning!

Nothing personal, Mate. You just have something I need.

Who helped you?

Id: [0x0007DFAD]
Oh, thank goodness.

Id: [0x0007DFAE]
Have you seen Patience Gibbs?

Id: [0x0007DFAF]
They said to remain silent or they would shoot her.

Id: [0x0007DFB0]
I'll find her quietly. Just tell me where they took her.

Id: [0x0007DFB1]
Maybe with the others they captured.

Id: [0x0007DFB8]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0007DFB9]
I'm trying to help Patience Gibbs.

Id: [0x0007DFBA]
There was a captain, giving orders. He's still here, searching for something. He knows where they are taking her. He sent them.

Id: [0x0007DFBB]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0007DFBC]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0007DFBD]
Have you seen Patience Gibbs?

Find the others. She must be with them.

Have you seen Patience?

Who are you? Why do you want her?

Id: [0x0007DFC2]
I'm trying to help.[Beat] Just tell me what you know please.

Duncan, would you indulge us with a Demonstration of your Techniques?

I'll tell you this: I will marry her. I will kill you if I must, I will have your half of the map. And then the world will see which brother has more honour.

Id: [0x0007E2E4]
I bid you good day!

Id: [0x0007E2E5]
Follow me at a distance. If anyone sees you, tell them you are my bodyguard. There are thieves about who would stop at nothing to secure either half of the map.

Id: [0x0007E2E7]
[shocked reaction at being attacked.]

Id: [0x0007E2E8]
Vance. He said he would kill me. I thought it was bluster. He is my brother. Despite what you told me, I thought it meant something.

Id: [0x0007E2E9]
You're safe for now. But perhaps a trip away from Nassau would do you some good.

Id: [0x0007E2EA]
Ah... And how would you know?

Id: [0x0007E2EB]
I'll fix that mouth so it stops talking 'bout mas!

Id: [0x0007E2ED]
Mate, the father, the son, and the holy- what's the third one again?

Id: [0x0007E2EE]
The father, the son, and the let's keep it move-- no, that's not it.

Id: [0x0007E2EF]
What does it matter?

Id: [0x0007E2F0]
[laughs]

Id: [0x0007E2F1]
It doesn't. It' doesn't matter. Nothing in this sour life does.

Id: [0x0007E2F2]
Let's keep it moving.

Id: [0x0007E2F3]
Keep it moving.

Id: [0x0007E2F4]
I thought everyone knew. That's right! I said it.

Id: [0x0007E2F5]
They all look like that woman to me.

Id: [0x0007E2FB]
Upton, mate, no! Guards! There are guards nearby.

Id: [0x0007E2FC]
Piss off!

Id: [0x0007E2FD]
They won't stand for this.

Id: [0x0007E2FE]
I said, piss off! I need a piss.

Id: [0x0007E300]
What? Why won't no one let me so much as take a piss.

Id: [0x0007E301]
I'm like a child.

Id: [0x0007E302]
It's alright, mate.

Id: [0x0007E303]
Help me not be like a child.

Id: [0x0007E304]
You just need the drink to wear off. Are you safe here?

Id: [0x0007E305]
Good.

Id: [0x0007E306]
No mate. You sound quite the scholar.

Id: [0x0007E307]
I'm so afraid for him! Oh, please help keep him safe!

Id: [0x0007E308]
You're a forever friend, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007E309]
Mmm.

Id: [0x0007E30A]
I don't want't to be like a child, Edward.

Id: [0x0007E30B]
Down, boy!

Id: [0x0007E30C]
Get it loaded!

Id: [0x0007E30D]
Faster men, we don't have much time!

Id: [0x0007E30E]
Quickly!

Id: [0x0007E30F]
[he laughs]

Id: [0x0007E310]
Move!

Id: [0x0007E311]
Fall back!

Id: [0x0007E312]
Defend me!

Id: [0x0007E313]
Behind you!

Id: [0x0007E314]
Advance!

Id: [0x0007E315]
Retreat!

Id: [0x0007E316]
Keep your Heads low!

Id: [0x0007E317]
To the Left!

Id: [0x0007E318]
To the Right!

Id: [0x0007E319]
Another Wave from the South!

Id: [0x0007E31A]
Another Wave from the North!

Id: [0x0007E31B]
Another Wave from the East!

Id: [0x0007E31C]
Another Wave from the West!

Id: [0x0007E31D]
They're coming from above!

Id: [0x0007E31E]
He's a slippery one. He won't behave like an ordinary Soldier.

Id: [0x0007E31F]
If we can even identify him.

Id: [0x0007E320]
I've never met a Soldier as cunning as a Maroon. It's no Mistake he's been harder to defeat than the weak who came before him.

Id: [0x0007E321]
That was not the right Man!

Id: [0x0007E322]
I told you to be careful.

Id: [0x0007E323]
Pick wrong, and Abraham will be alerted.

Id: [0x0007E325]
That was not him!

Id: [0x0007E333]
Move your ass and do your Job, [FR][fils de putain !](Son of a bitch!)

Id: [0x0007E35D]
[Cheerings]

Id: [0x0007E390]
A good Capitaine, he takes care of his men, yes? The sailors are un peu dissatisfied that there are no women of comfort here. I know just where to find them, but we need to build them a home.

Id: [0x0007E394]
Been thinking Cap'n, why not build ourselves a grand old bonfire by the beach? The lads'd be o'better cheer if they had such a spot to let loose, ye savvy?

Id: [0x0007E398]
Duncan! They're talking about my Sugar!

Id: [0x0007E399]
[SP][Del altercado de anoche, sí. En una de las tabernas.](From that Scuffle last Night, right. At one of the Taverns.)

[SP][El capitán tiene las llaves del Castillo. Y nos ha prometido que podremos echar un vistazo antes de entregarlo.](The Captain there has the Castillo's key. And he promised us a quick Look before giving it all away.)

Id: [0x0007E39F]
Duncan, they say our Cargo is in the Castillo. Evidently that ostentatious Chap there has the Key.

Id: [0x0007E3FE]
Just leave me be!

Id: [0x0007E3FF]
Change Course, Edward! Change your bloody Course before it's too late!

Id: [0x0007E404]
Hello! [SP][¿Hola?](Hello?) You speak English? Spanish?

Id: [0x0007E406]
Some of both, yes.

Id: [0x0007E408]
Ah, good. You haven't seen a young English Lad Kicking about have you? A young sailor called Kidd.

Id: [0x0007E40A]
Yes, Captain Kenway. He is Inland now, waiting for you.

Id: [0x0007E40C]
You keep these things as pets?

Id: [0x0007E40E]
Messengers. This is how we communicate between these islands. How we share information... and contracts.

Id: [0x0007E40F]
Contracts?

Id: [0x0007E410]
Master Kidd is waiting for you. You should find him.

Id: [0x0007E415]
!*Ahoy, Mister Kidd. It's a long Way to sail for a secret Parlay.

Id: [0x0007E416]
!*Be subtle about turning `round...

Id: [0x0007E419]
!*...we're being watched.

Id: [0x0007E41B]
!*We're deep in the Spanish Main. Why should seeing a few Spaniards trouble us?

Id: [0x0007E41D]
!*They arrived on a Templar ship. And they're here for the same Prize we are.[beat] The Key to the the Mayan Ruins.

Id: [0x0007E41F]
!*We should follow...

Id: [0x0007E42A]
You understand?

Id: [0x0007E42B]
I think so. I've seen it's like before. Glowing, like moonlight on the Ocean.

Id: [0x0007E42E]
Most never find it. Others it takes Years to tease out. But for a rare Few it comes as natural as Breathing.

Id: [0x0007E430]
You are a gifted man, Edward.

Id: [0x0007E431]
How many?

Id: [0x0007E433]
A few Dozen, I think.

Id: [0x0007E436]
He has the Sense, Mentor.

Id: [0x0007E439]
[SP][¿Le has dado a algo? ¿Ves algo?](Did you hit Something? Can you see?)

Id: [0x0007E45A]
Now Edward!

Id: [0x0007E45B]
Kenway, now!

Id: [0x0007E45C]
Go! while they're re-loading!

Id: [0x0007E45D]
Now's your Chance, Kenway!

Id: [0x0007E461]
Retreat to your little Hole, like the Rodent you are, Flint!

Id: [0x0007E468]
Does he need to do anything? Sometimes Examples just have to be made.

Id: [0x0007E469]
[laughter] Now isn't that just the Truth?

Id: [0x0007E46B]
I don't know. To make an Example of, or some such.

Id: [0x0007E46C]
Well what did he do?

Id: [0x0007E479]
What's this? Only Survivor?

Id: [0x0007E47A]
Only captive.

Id: [0x0007E47B]
You didn't... lose... the Battle then?

Id: [0x0007E47C]
How can we win when the Dogs hole up in the Mountains? They just hide in Caves and wait. See us coming every Time.

Id: [0x0007E47D]
I hope Commander Abraham knows what he's doing.

Id: [0x0007E47E]
I've no Doubt he'll win in the End. I'll follow him to my Death!

Id: [0x0007E485]
We had a hundred Men, and they... we couldn't even see them to count them.

Id: [0x0007E486]
What kind of Weapons they got in them there Caves?

Id: [0x0007E487]
Knives and Axes, mostly. A little Gunpowder, not much. Barely more than Sticks and Rocks.

Id: [0x0007E488]
And yet this is the only Man you could capture.

Id: [0x0007E489]
The only one!

Id: [0x0007E48A]
They must be backed by some strange African Magic. Curses and Voodoo.

Id: [0x0007E48B]
It's just not Christian.

Id: [0x0007E48E]
Wait for me to distract these hardheads.

Id: [0x0007E48F]
Hide while I distract them.

Id: [0x0007E490]
Go on. Hide. I'll distract them.

Id: [0x0007E493]
Greetings, fools!

Id: [0x0007E494]
Is it me you're looking for?

Id: [0x0007E495]
Take your best shot!

Id: [0x0007E496]
Is that the best you can do?

Id: [0x0007E497]
You're not much of a fighter, are you?

Id: [0x0007E498]
Some wonder my men keep beating you!

Id: [0x0007E499]
Is "English" another word for "weak?"

Id: [0x0007E49B]
Go to the Bureau.

Id: [0x0007E49C]
Meet me at the Bureau.

Id: [0x0007E49D]
You must exercise Caution. The Area will be well-guarded.

Id: [0x0007E49F]
The Drunks and Whores you call Friends might help you now.

Id: [0x0007E4A0]
Look for a Hole in the Fence. We'll catch them unawares.

Id: [0x0007E4A1]
Hide. I will distract them again.

Id: [0x0007E4A2]
You know how this works. Take your Position.

Id: [0x0007E4A3]
Hey!

Id: [0x0007E4A4]
Ho there!

Id: [0x0007E4A5]
Over here!

Id: [0x0007E4AC]
Go. Hide. When he arrives, follow me.

Id: [0x0007E4AD]
Hide there. Follow me when Vance arrives.

Id: [0x0007E4AE]
Hide until Vance arrives.

Id: [0x0007E4AF]
Hide! He'll be here soon.

Id: [0x0007E62B]
Yes, yes... we trade at Prices Mister Beckford knows are fair. And with a Quality he knows is sound.

Id: [0x0007E62C]
Aye. 'Tis hearty Molasses and raw Cane. That's a given.

Id: [0x0007E62D]
It gladdens me to hear your saying so. Despite the Waywardness of your Enterprise here, I understand that you are men of Discernment.

Id: [0x0007E62E]
Point of Fact... if you mean to make permanent trading Partners with Mister Beckford and his Associates, I'd advise you to incorporate your Talents, all together, and make Something solid of this Shantytown.

Id: [0x0007E62F]
It would go some way to strengthen Mister Beckford's Confidence in you all. Yes indeed.

Id: [0x0007E645]
[SP][¡Vamos, deprisa!](Hurry now!) We've four Harbours to hit this week!

Id: [0x0007E649]

Speed along, [SP][muchachos](Men)! Double Time!

Id: [0x0007E64D]
We'll weigh Anchor before Dawn!

Id: [0x0007E64F]
Lively, Lads!

Id: [0x0007E651]
Eh, oh! Look alive!

Id: [0x0007E656]
So many Churches in Kingston. Have the English at last taken to converting their Slaves to the Christian Faith?

Id: [0x0007E657]
Convert them! God knows, Torres! There's none here so foolish as that.

Id: [0x0007E658]
Foolish? How do you mean?

Id: [0x0007E659]
Is it not a Sin to enslave a fellow Christian? Therefore, to transmute a Slave's Soul from Animal to Man would be tantamount to inviting one's Cattle to the Dinner Table.

Id: [0x0007E65C]
Stop that!

Id: [0x0007E65D]
Put it away!

Id: [0x0007E65E]
Oy! This is sacred ground!

Id: [0x0007E65F]
I'll teach you to urinate!

Id: [0x0007E661]
Are they muses or furies? I can't tell!

Id: [0x0007E668]
Captain. You have the Look of a man crafting a bold Idea. A Look I've seen before.

Id: [0x0007E669]
You mark well, Adé. I've just overheard one of the Beckford Men talking grandly about his Plantation, and all the Cargo he's keeping there.

Id: [0x0007E66A]
And it gave me the Idea that I might take these Goods off him, and sell them off for a better Price than he'd ever Ask.

Id: [0x0007E683]
[laughs]Ah! A man of Vision. I like this Idea.

Id: [0x0007E686]
This Man's working for Peter Beckford's People. Do you know them? The Beckfords and their Sugar Empire?

Id: [0x0007E687]
Aye. The Beckfords and the Draxes. I never worked their Plantations, but I knew their Names from hearing other Men curse them.

Id: [0x0007E688]
But you worked a Plantation, no?

Id: [0x0007E689]
A modest One, aye. As a Striker in the boiling House.

Id: [0x0007E68A]
Boiling House? Was it Water they boiled? Or something Else?

Id: [0x0007E68B]
Cane Juices. It's a hard Process making Sugar. Dangerous too. Must be why it fetches such a dear Price.

Id: [0x0007E68C]
What's it like toiling on a Plantation, Day and Night?

Id: [0x0007E68D]
Well, with the cane Sugar cut and harvested, it's run between two Metal Rollers that crush the Juice from the Plant.

Id: [0x0007E68E]
Often it would happen that a Man got his Arm trapped in a Roller, and crushed it to the thinness of a Crepe.

Id: [0x0007E68F]
In those Times, it was an Axe that separated the Man from his Plight... meaning his Arm from his Body.

Id: [0x0007E690]
Jaysus.

Id: [0x0007E691]
After collecting the Juice, it was time to boil away the Waters from the Sugar. This we did in Taches made of Copper.

Id: [0x0007E692]
And let me tell you, Breddah. Boiling Sugar is near the hottest Thing on Earth. Just a Touch on the Skin will stick like Birdlime and burn on, leaving a terrible Scar.

Id: [0x0007E693]
I had Friends lose Eyes, and Fingers, and Arms working the boiling House. And as Slaves, believe that we never heard a Word of Praise nor an Apology of any Kind.

Id: [0x0007E696]
Hold, Adé. There's Trouble Afore.

Id: [0x0007E697]
I see them.

Id: [0x0007E698]
They mean to take her Cargo, of which she has none. The real Prize is that Man's Plantation.

Id: [0x0007E699]
Shall we stop 'em?

Id: [0x0007E69A]
We'd be Fools not to.

Id: [0x0007E69F]
What's happened here! Why such Disarray?

Id: [0x0007E6A0]
Bit of a Do, Sir. That's all. It's Wilmington's birthday.

Id: [0x0007E6A2]
And you saw fit to get pickled on Duty!

Id: [0x0007E6A4]
It's no Bother, Sir. We've everything sorted.

Id: [0x0007E6A5]
We'll soon see, won't we? For you must double the Watch this Evening.

Id: [0x0007E6A6]
Double, Sir? Whatever for?

Id: [0x0007E6A7]
I believe I was followed here, young Man. By Pirates if my Eyes honour me, though the Ship was uncommonly large for such Rascals.

Id: [0x0007E6A8]
Certainly wasn't Slavers, though. Not a Ship that size.

Id: [0x0007E6A9]
In any Case, double the Watch! And keep your damned Eyes wide for anything suspicious.

Id: [0x0007E722]
I saw. I know where it is.

Id: [0x0007E723]
Thin them out before the next Wave.

Id: [0x0007E724]
The more of them you kill now, the less effective they will be in the next Wave.

Id: [0x0007E726]
This will be easy. You took out so many already.

Id: [0x0007E727]
You took out so many, we can handle this one-handed!

Id: [0x0007E728]
You killed so many. This will be simple.

Id: [0x0007E72A]
There are so many left! This will be difficult!

Id: [0x0007E72B]
There are so many of them, still. It will be tough.

Id: [0x0007E72C]
So many still live! This will not be easy.

Id: [0x0007E72D]
Our Numbers are many.[Laugh] They will not stand a Chance.

Id: [0x0007E72E]
Pity they will not be invited, to see us celebrate before our Victory.

Id: [0x0007E72F]
Quite.

Id: [0x0007E730]
I've just come from the Barracks. I'm quite certain the new Weapons Shipments will End our Maroon Problem once and for all.

Id: [0x0007E731]
That is the Plan! That is the Plan.

Id: [0x0007E732]
Do you think they'll be expecting it?

Id: [0x0007E733]
Most likely. They always do somehow. But this time, it won't matter.

Id: [0x0007E734]
[laughter]

Id: [0x0007E735]
[laughter]

Id: [0x0007E73A]

Id: [0x0007E73B]
I Believe I just saved your life, Mate.

Id: [0x0007E77C]
Kenway! Take the bloody Wheel!

Id: [0x0007E77E]
Hughes is dead, Kenway! You'll have to steer this Bastard!

Id: [0x0007E783]
Bring us close, Kenway! We can scuttle her!

Id: [0x0007E785]
We'll give a good Broadside. Ready!

Id: [0x0007E787]
Uncork the Cannons, Lad!

Id: [0x0007E789]
Unload all the Shot we have!

Fire on those Bastards!

Id: [0x0007E797]
Follow and I'll kill you!

Id: [0x0007E798]
Keep your Distance!

Id: [0x0007E799]
You leave me be and I'll not bother you!

Id: [0x0007E79E]
I'd have been hailed a Hero...!

Id: [0x0007E79F]
Where... where is this Place?

H-Hello…? [SP][¿Hay alguien? ¡Ayúdenme, por favor!](Anybody? Help me, please!)

We've really opened it up now, haven't we![laugh]

Id: [0x0007E842]
A Blade in a Crowd is always the simplest. Nothing grandiose. Just quick and clean.

Id: [0x0007E843]
Show us another Technique!

Id: [0x0007E846]
Quite ingenious to use Bales of Hay for Cover, don't you think?

God! That's the Spirit! Secrecy.

Id: [0x0007E852]
God blind me, that's a clever Trick!

Id: [0x0007E855]
Is it also possible to deliver a killing Blow at high Speed?

Id: [0x0007E857]

Excellent! Such Balance.

Id: [0x0007E864]
Ah, ha! Did you see that?

Id: [0x0007E869]
The Assassins have trained you well, Duncan. You chose a perfect Time to leave them behind.

Id: [0x0007E86A]
At great Risk, I imagine. Betraying the Assassins is never good for one's Health.

Id: [0x0007E86B]
Well, neither is drinking Liquor, but I am drawn to its Dangers all the same.

Id: [0x0007E86F]
And what is your Business here, Sir? Are you an Associate of the Governor's? Or a pending acquaintance like myself?

Id: [0x0007E870]
Ah, I am a ... how do you say ...[FR][un marchand d'armes ?](Weapons Dealer?) I deal in pilfered Guns and Armaments.

Id: [0x0007E872]
A Smuggler of sorts.

Id: [0x0007E873]
Guns, Blades, Cannons, Grenadoes. Anything that may kill a Man, I am happy to provide.

Id: [0x0007E876]
Duncan ... if I recall, your Creed commands you to stay your Blade from the Flesh of innocent men.

Id: [0x0007E877]
It might have at one Time, when innocent Men still walked the Earth.

Right! We'll need a Crew.

There's many Prisoners held on these Ships. Set them free, and they'll sail with us, no Question.

Id: [0x0007EA36]
There's a catch to this Favor. You're sailing with me.

Id: [0x0007EA37]
I'd follow you to Hell for this, Mate!

These men know their Place. They'll see us Home.

Id: [0x0007EA58]
Keep watch on those Galleons! See they don't give us Trouble.

Id: [0x0007EA59]
They won't. Far too slow for this Weather.

Id: [0x0007EA5C]
So that's the Idea then? Free what Men we can, then find a fast Ship to Flee in?

Id: [0x0007EA5D]
Aye. There's a Brig in this Fleet. I`ll make my Way to it.

Id: [0x0007EABC]
Pierre handed in his notice this morning. This new security measure is freaking people out.

Id: [0x0007EABD]
They won't let him go. It's part of our contract. Having ultra-high security clearance means you have to go through a whole debriefing process. It takes months.

Id: [0x0007EAC0]
What’s with all these security notices I'm seeing lately?

Id: [0x0007EAC1]
Just a standard message we use on occasion. Nothing to worry about. We've just had some issues around the office lately.

Id: [0x0007EAC4]
Hey thanks for sharing the White Whale data with me. I was able to track it down myself.

Id: [0x0007EAC5]
No problem, man. It's amazing, right?

Id: [0x0007EAF8]
The body has been moved?

Id: [0x0007EAFC]
So you managed everything ok?

Id: [0x0007EAFD]
Yeah thanks for that – it was a big help.

Id: [0x0007EB00]
Marco! Missed you at the Lumiere festival last night.

Id: [0x0007EB01]
I was there. We talked for an hour before going down!

Id: [0x0007EB04]
[FR][Non, moi non plus, je ne sais pas où elle est. J'ai entendu dire qu'elle était partie en pleurant, je ne sais pas trop pourquoi, et qu'elle était pas revenue.](No I don’t know where she is either – she’s just not here. I heard that she ran off crying about something and hasn’t come back.)

Id: [0x0007EC5E]
Really? I had no idea.

Id: [0x0007EC5F]
Read the fine print man. Working for Abstergo has its benefits, but there are some drawbacks too. Big ones.

Id: [0x0007EC60]
Like, server security issues? Because these notices seem pretty severe. Like, draconian actually.

Id: [0x0007EC61]
No, no. It's nothing to worry about, really. Walk with me and I'll explain.

Id: [0x0007EC72]
Yeah, I tracked it down as soon as I saw your message. Followed it for a while... couldn't catch it though.

Id: [0x0007EC74]
So did Edward really meet all those pirates? The famous ones?

Id: [0x0007EC75]
Yes, he did. Blackbeard, Calico Jack, Anne Bonny, Mary Read, Bartholomew Roberts.

Id: [0x0007EC76]
Crazy. Nassau must have been a wild place.

Id: [0x0007EC77]
For a while, yeah. But not after... well. I don't want to spoil it.

Id: [0x0007EC78]
And they pay out bonuses too. Inconvenience Pay, they call it.

Id: [0x0007EC79]
Really? That's actually kind of nice.

Id: [0x0007EC7B]
Yeah... yeah, he was killed... shot in the chest multiple times... no, no that shouldn't be a problem... we collected more than enough data-- we'll know soon enough... mm-hm, mm-hm... all right... All right I can send you the results as soon as possible... Okay... any word on Olivier... dammit... God I'm worried sick... yeah... all right... thanks Laetitia... bye.

Id: [0x0007EC7C]
Yes sir. And preserved. We'll do what we can.

Id: [0x0007EC7D]
Good. Let’s keep security units on standby. I know Miss Lemay said the situation was under control, but I have a feeling we may be needing them again soon.

Id: [0x0007EC7F]
No problem – I remember the first time I did this for more than an hour. I had similar kinds of effects from the Animus. [Beat] Just if it happens again have a word with Melanie and see if it needs checking out.

Id: [0x0007EC80]
OK.

Id: [0x0007EC81]
We did? When?

Id: [0x0007EC82]
At Nouveau Palais. We shared a booth before taking a Taxi downtown. You don't remember? You kept talking about how damn cold it was.

Id: [0x0007EC83]
Shit. Eliane brought Mezcal to dinner. I don't remember much after dessert.[beat] How was the show?

Id: [0x0007EC84]
Great. Really beautiful.[Beat] You seemed like you were having fun.

Id: [0x0007EC85]
That's good.

Id: [0x0007EC86]
I’m glad that’s over. I hate it when they escalate the security. Makes me jumpy.

Id: [0x0007EC87]
Did they put anyone in the bunker this time?

Id: [0x0007EC88]
Just for a few days, I think. It sucks, but... I suppose it's necessary? We deal with some really sensitive data.

Id: [0x0007EC89]
Classified shit, yeah. I don't know how I feel about it but... It's in our contracts, so...

Id: [0x0007ECE6]
[FR][Evidemment, si je la vois, je lui dirai que tu as appelé.](Of course if I find her I’ll let her know you called.)

Id: [0x0007ECE7]
[FR][Toi aussi. Au revoir !](You too. Goodbye!)

Id: [0x0007ECF8]
Look, I saw the official statement. They're claiming it was a heart attack. So that's that.

Id: [0x0007ECF9]
But you saw the guy’s wrist, didn't you? There was a cross! Don't tell me that's just a coincidence.

Id: [0x0007ECFA]
Officially, yes. It's a coincidence. End of story.

Id: [0x0007ECFB]
Officially...[FR][Merde.](shit.) And what about Unofficially.

Id: [0x0007ECFC]
Unofficially... I don't know. I want to believe the best, but I always fear the worst.[Beat] Now stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.

Id: [0x0007ED46]
Looks to me like a Crew of Pirates here.

Id: [0x0007ED47]
Aye. Mixing with these Heathens. Makes me bloody sick.

Id: [0x0007ED49]
Who's this Dutch fella we brought here? What a Sourpuss, he is.

Id: [0x0007ED4A]
A Slaver named Prins. I'm told he has a Letter of Marque from Governor Hamilton. And that we're to afford him every Courtesy.

Id: [0x0007ED4B]
That's a queer Combination.

Id: [0x0007ED4C]
Look, all I know is he's looking for Someone. And we're to help him find it.

Id: [0x0007ED4D]
Gah! Carting old Misers around ain't what I signed up for.

Id: [0x0007ED4E]
You were pressed into service, you Nob!

Id: [0x0007ED50]
God's Truth, I can't fathom why.

Id: [0x0007ED51]
Can't handle living among Men, can they. Can't handle the Christian life. So they come here.

Id: [0x0007ED53]
You seen this Temple here? It's massive.

Id: [0x0007ED54]
Aye. I'm wondering if it's full of Gold and Jade and the Like.

Id: [0x0007ED59]
Has to be, don't it? Where else would the Dagos get it?

Id: [0x0007ED5A]
Pulling it out of the Ground, ain't they?

Id: [0x0007ED5B]
Somewhat. The Path winds further still, beset by more unruly Men. Go...

Id: [0x0007ED5D]
See about catching that One, Captain! We're too far along to have our Plans disrupted by an Idiot.

Id: [0x0007ED5E]
Quite the Contrary, Edward. These Wags would have gone mad at seeing what lies beyond this Gate.

Id: [0x0007EE13]
[Muffled crying 4]

Id: [0x0007EE3C]
Oh, Perhaps we should split up to confuse them.

Id: [0x0007EE3D]
It's the best Idea you've had Today.

Id: [0x0007EE49]
[Laughs]Quite.

Id: [0x0007EE4B]
Pull off a few Shots, if you like. Get a Feel for it.

Id: [0x0007EE4E]

Excellent.

I have a Friend in England you may like to meet, Julien. James Puckle... he's working on Something extraordinary.

Id: [0x0007EE89]
Wonderful. You're a crack Shot, Duncan! As good with a Pistol as with your Wrist Blade, I imagine.

Id: [0x0007EE8A]
If only he had one....

Id: [0x0007EEA0]
Enough Amusements, Duncan. How about a true Challenge?

Id: [0x0007EEA3]
What say you, Duncan? A Contest?

Id: [0x0007EEA4]
Why not prove yourself, hm?

Id: [0x0007EEA5]
A Challenge, when you're ready.

Id: [0x0007EEA8]
All right. Here's a simple Challenge.

Id: [0x0007EEA9]
Try to strike every target before this Hourglass empties.

Id: [0x0007EEAA]
Remember, hit every Target within the allotted Time.

Id: [0x0007EEAD]
Ah! Bad Luck. Try again.

Id: [0x0007EEAE]
An off Day, Duncan?

Id: [0x0007EEAF]
Rotten Luck, eh?

Id: [0x0007EEB4]
I don't like this Route, Torres. We're exposed.

Id: [0x0007EEB5]
The Assassins will be watching the Docks near my Estate. We must take an alternate Route.

Id: [0x0007EEB7]
Such a Fuss over one Man. Is the Observatory really such a grand Prize?

Id: [0x0007EEB8]
[SP][Sí, sin duda.](Yes, indeed.) The Observatory was a Tool built by the Precursor Race. Its Worth is without Measure.

You are persistent, but I will always be faster.

What it's like, reliving her memories?

Id: [0x0007F008]
Not really, aside from the headaches. They've been worse since I started staying in longer. But... I don't want to stop. I like her. I want to know what she does next.

Where did she hide the artifact?

[he spits]

Where is the artifact?

What artifact?

Id: [0x0007F040]
I will ask you one more time: where is the artifact?

Id: [0x0007F041]
I do not know. What does it do, this artifact?

Id: [0x0007F044]
Where is it?

Id: [0x0007F045]
Why would I know?

Id: [0x0007F047]
Where'd she hide it?

Id: [0x0007F048]
Let me go!

Id: [0x0007F049]
Oh, a comedian!

Id: [0x0007F04B]
Come on now. Where is it?

Id: [0x0007F04C]
I'll kill you.

Id: [0x0007F04D]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x0007F077]
How long do we have to stay here?

Id: [0x0007F078]
Until we find the artifact.

Id: [0x0007F079]
Then why are we just standing here?

Id: [0x0007F07B]
How valuable is this thing anyway?

Id: [0x0007F07C]
Dunno.

Id: [0x0007F07D]
Well what does it do, then?

Id: [0x0007F07E]
They wouldn't say.

Id: [0x0007F080]
I bet the artifact ain't even here. I bet she has it on her somewhere.

Id: [0x0007F081]
That's why I'm not even looking for it. They'll find it soon enough.

Id: [0x0007F082]
It's so boring here. I wish there was more to do.

Id: [0x0007F083]
Tell me about it.

Id: [0x0007F090]
Any news from the men who went after her?

Id: [0x0007F091]
Well they brought her back. But some of them are still looking for the artifact, I think.

Id: [0x0007F092]
It's taking them long enough.

Id: [0x0007F093]
I'll say.

Id: [0x0007F095]
We due to see more supplies soon?

Id: [0x0007F096]
Hope so. They took half our stock to that slave girl's camp!

Id: [0x0007F097]
Decided to move in, did they?

Id: [0x0007F098]
Least until they find that artifact.

Id: [0x0007F09A]
Big operation for a small artifact.

Id: [0x0007F09B]
Why didn't they choose us to go find it, do you think?

Id: [0x0007F09C]
[laughs] Boy, that job's no promotion! You really fancy sleeping in a tent, digging around all day in the dirt after nothing?

Id: [0x0007F09D]
Why nothing? The man who finds it is sure to be rewarded.

Id: [0x0007F09E]
Not if she's hiding it on her someplace.

Id: [0x0007F0A8]
Another Wave!

Id: [0x0007F0A9]
To Arms!

Id: [0x0007F0AC]
Damn these Cutthroats! So well prepared.

Id: [0x0007F0AD]
As are we, Grand Master. Stay calm.

Id: [0x0007F0B0]
Here's another Attack!

Id: [0x0007F0B1]
Gather in!

Id: [0x0007F0B4]
[SP][¡Preparaos para partir! ¡Casi tenemos encima la tormenta!](Make ready to leave! That Storm's nearly upon us!)

Id: [0x0007F0B5]
[SP][¿Y qué pasa con los prisioneros?](What of the Prisoners?)

Id: [0x0007F0B6]
[SP][Que se ahoguen; ¡mejor ellos que nosotros!](Let them drown, else we all do!)

Id: [0x0007F0B8]
[SP][¡Los prisioneros han escapado!](The Prisoners have escaped!)

Id: [0x0007F0B9]
[SP][¡Alto ahí, maldita sea!](Stop right there, damn you!)

Id: [0x0007F0BA]
[Surprised in scream]Aieee!

Id: [0x0007F0C0]
I miss the sun.

Id: [0x0007F0C1]
Don't even know what time it is. Is it almost dinner yet?

Id: [0x0007F0C2]
We expecting many more of these?

Id: [0x0007F0C3]
I miss the sun.

Id: [0x0007F0C4]
Do you think the men who went to the camp are eating better than we are?

Id: [0x0007F0C5]
Don't care as long as we're paid the same.

Id: [0x0007F0CA]
We've saved all the Men we can, Breddah. And it's enough to form a Crew.

Id: [0x0007F0CB]
All we're lack now is a Ship of our own!

Id: [0x0007F13C]
These shadows! I'm seeing things.

Id: [0x0007F13D]
So you're seeing things. Who cares? Pull yourself together.

Id: [0x0007F13E]
It's like a shadow theatre in here. I hate the theatre.

Id: [0x0007F140]
I thought I'd see more excitement, posted to a fort.

Id: [0x0007F141]
Excitement? You want another war? For what?

Id: [0x0007F142]
[Sigh]Who is that man in black? I heard he was giving bribes.

Id: [0x0007F143]
Why am I never on duty the days that bribes are offered?

Id: [0x0007F145]
When they return, they owe us a pint.

Id: [0x0007F155]
That girl, in the prison. Who is she?

Id: [0x0007F156]
They say she lead a revolt, but I don't believe it.

Id: [0x0007F157]
That slave girl, in the prison-- why are they keeping her?

Id: [0x0007F158]
I don't know why they don't just punish the girl or send her back to her master. Why keep her here?

Id: [0x0007F186]
Help! Help!

Id: [0x0007F187]
Prisoner on the loose!

Id: [0x0007F188]
Stop her!

Id: [0x0007F189]
Catch her!

Id: [0x0007F18A]
Stop her!

Id: [0x0007F18B]
To the prison!

Id: [0x0007F19A]
Intruder!

Id: [0x0007F19B]
We've been breached!

Id: [0x0007F19C]
Stop her!

Id: [0x0007F19D]
Stop! Intruder!

Id: [0x0007F19E]
Ring the alarms!

Id: [0x0007F19F]
All men to your stations!

Id: [0x0007F22B]
He did not have so many witnesses as we do in Nassau. Trust me. He is doing it now.

Id: [0x0007F22C]
Right this moment?

Id: [0x0007F22D]
Nothing can save him now.

Id: [0x0007F22F]
Not over there.

Id: [0x0007F230]
Work with me, mate.

Id: [0x0007F231]
Turn around.

Id: [0x0007F232]
Not that way!

Id: [0x0007F233]
No!

Id: [0x0007F234]
That's it!

Id: [0x0007F235]
Yes, towards me.

Id: [0x0007F236]
There's trouble over there.

Id: [0x0007F237]
Just go as straight as you can.

Id: [0x0007F239]
[belch]

Id: [0x0007F23A]
[small burp]

Id: [0x0007F23B]
[alphabet burp? other creative burp?]

Id: [0x0007F23C]
I don't feel so good.

Id: [0x0007F23E]
This way.

Id: [0x0007F23F]
[big burp]

Id: [0x0007F240]
Who the hell are you?

Id: [0x0007F241]
Mate, I think I drank too much.

Id: [0x0007F339]
Fair enough.

Id: [0x0007F33D]
What do you mean? What are you implying?

Id: [0x0007F33E]
I am not implying; I am merely asking: Do you really imagine Jing as the lady of the house? Mistress of servants, brood mother?

Id: [0x0007F33F]
Why should I not imagine it. Do you question her love? Her fitness?

Id: [0x0007F340]
Of course not. But knowing her as you do, you must appreciate that she is a woman of action. She needs the sea, a challenge. How will she adapt to a quiet, domestic life.

Id: [0x0007F341]
I only worry for your safety, brother.

Id: [0x0007F342]
You always had to be the favored child, the golden boy. You can't stand it that she would give her heart to me, when she can't even give you a second glance! So you hate her!

Id: [0x0007F343]
I have no hate. Only concern.

Id: [0x0007F351]
And I'll bring my Ship closer, shall I? We'll rescue my Sugar yet!

Id: [0x0007F353]
Good Morning, Duncan. Just over here...

Id: [0x0007F356]
Edward! Hello, Edward!

Id: [0x0007F359]
I found a Man to purchase my remaining Sugar![Beat] Quite a Coup, I must say!

Id: [0x0007F35A]
He just called you Edward.

Id: [0x0007F35B]
Oh, that's the Merchant who sailed me here. Out of Caution, I gave him a false Name.

Id: [0x0007F35C]
Ah... well done.

Id: [0x0007F35E]
We'll catch up, Bonnet! Later.

Id: [0x0007F3CC]
Let's make some Headway, shall we?

Id: [0x0007F3CD]
Find us a Schooner with that Spyglass, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007F3D0]
Take out your Glass, Kenway. Schooners are too small to peep with a naked Eye.

Id: [0x0007F3D1]
Are you trifling with me, Lad? Take out your Spyglass.

Id: [0x0007F3D2]
You won't find Nothing squinting into the Sun like that. Use your Glass.

Id: [0x0007F3F1]
After you subdue a Prize, project Authority and demand Respect that you would never give yourself. This weaves a Spell over soft Minds.

Id: [0x0007F3F2]
Your Victims must feel blessed to be in your presence. But never let them feel they have found a Friend in you.

Id: [0x0007F3F3]
For your Victims must always have in the Back of their Minds the uneasy Idea that you could snap at any Moment, and unseam them from Prick to Sternum.

Id: [0x0007F3F4]
In other Words, be a Gentleman ... until one of them is not.

Id: [0x0007F415]
You'll get yourself a Glimpse of what sort of Cargo they're shipping, and a general Idea of their Toughness.

Id: [0x0007F416]
There's a Prize worth taking!

Id: [0x0007F419]
Fire what Cannons you will, and land a few Strikes if you must. But for God's Sake don't sink her.

Id: [0x0007F41A]
It's no fun fishing Cargo out of the Sea. Although it can be done.

Id: [0x0007F41D]
You've scuffed her up Nice! Only don't put a hole below her Waterline.

Id: [0x0007F41E]
Careful now. You're doing heavy Damage.

Id: [0x0007F421]
Ho ho! She's dead in the Water! Steer up along side her.

Id: [0x0007F422]
Ease in close. We'll ready the Grapnels.

Id: [0x0007F423]
Lay up alongside her.

Id: [0x0007F426]
I'll lead the Party aboard for this one, Kenway. You watch and learn....

Id: [0x0007F4A6]
Blast! This is getting well out of Hand.

Id: [0x0007F4A7]
A dozen Crates of Medicine should not be so hard to come by.

Id: [0x0007F4A8]
That ain't my Meaning. It's Thatch and Hornigold and this pointless Feud of theirs. Can't you feel it?

Id: [0x0007F4A9]
I do, aye. But both Men have their Hearts in a good Place.

Id: [0x0007F4AA]
Both want the Best for the People of Nassau.

Id: [0x0007F4AB]
But is that the best Course for us? Saving a City that ain't worth much? We're not Men made to Govern. We take and spend, and live heartily... wherever we go.

Id: [0x0007F4AC]
What Solution would you propose?

Id: [0x0007F4AD]
The answer's in Wealth and Power, not Politics. If we found the Observatory, we'd see enough Money to buy the whole of England.

Id: [0x0007F4AE]
Or it might be... we'd lord over these Kings and Emperors like they was Peasants themselves.

Id: [0x0007F4AF]
A lot of large Talk, Captain. But is it your Crew you sail for... or yourself?

Id: [0x0007F4B0]
I mean the Best for these Men, Adé. I do. But this don't sit right. I feel like I'm running Errands, not living my Life.

Id: [0x0007F4EC]
Piss off, Ben!

Id: [0x0007F4EF]
Saw you chewing the Fat with Hornigold and Thatch. Rather heated, it seems.

Id: [0x0007F4F0]
Nah. Not so bad as that. We're only dreaming up Remedies for Keeping Nassau in tip-top Shape.

Id: [0x0007F4F1]
Use that to dive for Coin and assorted Sundries, and she'll pay herself off in no Time at all.

Id: [0x0007F815]
Is someone in here with us?

Id: [0x0007F816]
It's possible. We're trespassing.

Id: [0x0007F819]
Kenway! You all right?

Id: [0x0007F81A]
Nothing needs mending. I'll find a Way up!

Id: [0x0007F81C]
It's clear Someone's watching us.

Id: [0x0007F81D]
I don't doubt it.

Id: [0x0007F81E]
The way forward's blocked.

Id: [0x0007F81F]
That's a Door, I reckon.

Id: [0x0007F820]
Aye. And there should be some Way to open it. A Mechanism somewhere...

Id: [0x0007F821]
Like a Capstan?

Id: [0x0007F822]
Hm. Those Blocks up there. Try moving them.

Id: [0x0007F825]
Those Blocks up there seem like they might move with a bit of Weight.

Id: [0x0007F826]
Edward, get up there and add your Weight to one of those Blocks.

Id: [0x0007F827]
[Shocked yell] Ah!

Id: [0x0007F828]
Ah! Dammit!

Id: [0x0007F829]
Easy, Kenway. This ain't like climbing Ratlines.

Id: [0x0007F82A]
[Gruff grumble]

Id: [0x0007F834]
Step lightly...

Id: [0x0007F83B]
Easy now. Haven't had much luck with these old Walkways.

Id: [0x0007F83C]
Ain't there an easier Way?

Id: [0x0007F83E]
Jaysus!

Id: [0x0007F83F]
Jim! I'm here.

Id: [0x0007F840]
Hang on, Man. I'm catching up.

Id: [0x0007F841]
But that wasn't you just ahead?

Id: [0x0007F842]
No, I been trailing you. What did you see?

Id: [0x0007F843]
I can't be sure.

Id: [0x0007F844]
[Effort Grunt while getting up]

Id: [0x0007F845]
[SP][Sí. De ese mercader de Barbados.](Aye. Taken from that Barbadian Merchant.)

Id: [0x0007F846]
Use Something else to see your way up here. We're getting close.

Id: [0x0007F847]
[Annoyed grunt]

Id: [0x0007F84A]
Only it's Something to do with this Water as well.

Id: [0x0007F84D]
Whatever is waiting at the End of this Path had better be worth my Time.

Id: [0x0007F84E]
That'll depend on you.

Id: [0x0007F84F]
How's that?

Id: [0x0007F850]
What I'm taking you to see may spin your Head right 'round. I only hope you can take the Shock of it.

Id: [0x0007F851]
I can handle myself.

Id: [0x0007F853]
Hint 1

Id: [0x0007F854]
Hint 2

Id: [0x0007F855]
Hint 3

Id: [0x0007F857]
We'll try this, right? I'll stand here, and you clamber over to that one there.

Id: [0x0007F858]
I might be able to make this Jump then. And open that Door.

Id: [0x0007F85A]
It's moving now. Hop on.

Id: [0x0007F85B]
Damn, this Thing won't budge! Lend us a Hand.

Id: [0x0007F85D]
What's the hold up? Jump up there, Man.

Id: [0x0007F85E]
Move it, Kenway. I'm not up here for my Health.

Id: [0x0007F85F]
Work your way on to that Statue, Man. Hurry.

Id: [0x0007F861]
You still drawing Breath?

Id: [0x0007F862]
Enough to curse you with, Kidd!

Id: [0x0007F863]
Our Friends are back to pester us.

Id: [0x0007F864]
They live in these Jungles. And they don't fancy us stomping about here. Avoid them if you can.

Id: [0x0007F866]
Can't you Assassins keep them in Line?

Id: [0x0007F867]
That's not how we work. We honour their Presence, even as they disagree with ours.

Id: [0x0007F869]
Leave this Life for a lasting Peace, down among the Dead.

Id: [0x0007F86B]
A great Shame it came to this. They were only protecting their Heritage.

Id: [0x0007F86C]
Must be a great treasure Beyond.

Id: [0x0007F86D]
Treasure. Right.

Id: [0x0007F86E]
Is this IT then? The grand Prize your Mentor asked me to see?

Id: [0x0007F86F]
Looks nothing like the Man they called the Sage, I'm sorry to say.

Id: [0x0007F870]
Keep your Trousers tied up. We've one more Riddle to solve.

Id: [0x0007F872]
These Statues are like the ones we've seen before, but with Pictures carved on them.

Id: [0x0007F873]
There's Pictures carved on the floor as well, but not of the same Sort.

Id: [0x0007F874]
There's a Correspondence then. But what...?

Id: [0x0007F876]
There a Difference between them Animals on the statues and them on the floor. Do you see it?

Id: [0x0007F877]
Aye. One group is Predators, the other is Prey.

Id: [0x0007F879]
Which Predator goes with which Prey, that's the Question.

Id: [0x0007F87A]
Right. There's your Correspondence. Match a Predator with its Prey.

Id: [0x0007F87C]
Seems that's not the right Position.

Id: [0x0007F87D]
I know, I know.

Id: [0x0007F87F]
Might be you can use the Lever to move them Drawings on the Ground.

Id: [0x0007F880]
I was just about to say the same.

Id: [0x0007F881]
Lend me a Hand here, will ya?

Id: [0x0007F883]
This isn't the right Position.

Id: [0x0007F885]
Heyo! That's a Match!

Id: [0x0007F886]
[A last dying breath]

Id: [0x0007F887]
[Effort Grunt while taking key]

Id: [0x0007F888]
[Effort Grunt while taking key]

Id: [0x0007F957]
[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x0007F958]
Hello?

Id: [0x0007F959]
Lads? Lieutenant? You out here?

Id: [0x0007F95A]
Jenkins. What's the news?

Id: [0x0007F95C]
It's damn near a Riot out there. And I reckon Kenway suspects something. He don't miss much.

Id: [0x0007F95E]
What about our man?

Id: [0x0007F95F]
They've been pressing him hard all night, but he's not broken yet.

Id: [0x0007F960]
Good.

Id: [0x0007F962]
What was that?

Id: [0x0007F964]
You certain you didn't bring some of those sand Rats in tow, Jenkins?

Id: [0x0007F965]
Look sharp. Stevens, make certain there's no Surprises.

Id: [0x0007F966]
Aye, sir.

Id: [0x0007F967]
Secure the other side and watch the path.

Id: [0x0007F968]
Aye.

Id: [0x0007F96B]
Uh... Nothing here. Oh, Why is it always me sent into the Muck?

Id: [0x0007F96E]
Stay here. Shoot anything that moves.

Id: [0x0007F96F]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x0007F970]
Come on. It's time.

Id: [0x0007F974]
Tell me about the beach.

Id: [0x0007F975]
A fair gathering, sir. Most too drunk to stand.

Id: [0x0007F976]
That will suit our purpose.

Id: [0x0007F978]
Thought for a moment I'd die there. Bloody savages.

Id: [0x0007F979]
Have no fear, Soldier. This will be the end of them.

Id: [0x0007F97B]
Quickly, send the signal.

Id: [0x0007F97E]
What?!

Id: [0x0007F97F]
Get him!

Id: [0x0007F988]
Stations, lads!

Id: [0x0007F989]
Today you fight for your Lives alone!

Id: [0x0007F98A]
Raise the Black Flag, Lads. Let 'em see it!

Id: [0x0007F98C]
Mortar!

Id: [0x0007F98E]
Captain! Broadside!

Id: [0x0007F990]
She's heading right for us, captain!

Id: [0x0007F991]
She's ready to be boarded!

Id: [0x0007F992]
Brace!

Id: [0x0007F993]
Brace! Braaaaace!

Id: [0x0007F995]
Board!

Id: [0x0007F999]
Ah. But they're stalling, thinking up Ways to avoid paying it out.

Id: [0x0007F99A]
[Effort Grunt]

Id: [0x0007F99B]
[Effort sound while getting up]

Id: [0x0007F99C]
I can arrange to have you in Thummikins [an old Scottish torture device]if flogging's too kind, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007F99D]
Find a way in.

Id: [0x0007F99E]
Go on, I'll follow.

Id: [0x0007F99F]
If you wait too long, we'll miss our Chance.

Id: [0x0007F9A0]
Find a Hole in the Fence.

Id: [0x0007F9A1]
I'll follow you.

Id: [0x0007F9A2]
Go on!

Id: [0x0007F9A4]
Now you'll pay, boy! Them's the rules. Unless you tell me where she hid it.

Id: [0x0007F9A5]
If you rethink that, it'll hurt less.

Id: [0x0007F9A6]
I don't care.

Id: [0x0007F9A7]
How should I know.

Id: [0x0007F9A9]

Id: [0x0007F9AA]
You! Where is Patience Gibbs? What is going on here?

Id: [0x0007F9AD]
I don't know. Store them? Smuggle them?

Id: [0x0007F9AE]
Smuggle them away from his own smuggling operation?

Id: [0x0007F9AF]
[laughter] I know it sounds ridiculous, but a job's a job.

Id: [0x0007F9B0]
I suppose you're right.

Id: [0x0007F9B1]
Smuggling from a smuggler. [laughter]

Id: [0x0007F9B2]
Hey, did you ever think about that word? "Smuggler?" Rather funny, ain't it?

Id: [0x0007F9B3]
Who ever thinks about words?

Id: [0x0007F9B4]
Well, not me, certainly, but say it: "smuggler."

Id: [0x0007F9B5]
Smuggler.

Id: [0x0007F9B6]
Smuggler!

Id: [0x0007F9B7]
You're right. It does have kind of a funny ring to it. Smuggler!

Id: [0x0007F9B8]
Wait mate. Maybe we shouldn't be saying it quite so loud though?

Id: [0x0007F9B9]
On account of it being smuggling?

Id: [0x0007F9BA]
Right.

Id: [0x0007F9BB]
Right.

Id: [0x0007F9BC]
Will the others be waiting for us when we get there?

Id: [0x0007F9BE]
Yes. This should be easy.

Id: [0x0007F9BF]
So we move the goods. Then we go to the inn.

Id: [0x0007F9C0]
Oh, we should be so lucky!

The Travers Estate and Plantations. No more smuggling. No more organizing men. No shipments. No risk. Why not begin now?

Id: [0x0007FAEB]
Captain, there's a Wreck yonder. Looks recent.

Id: [0x0007FAEC]
I see it. Let's hope Thatch hasn't come to the same End.

Id: [0x0007FAFC]
Adé. See there!

Id: [0x0007FAFD]
It's her, Captain! The Queen Anne's Revenge. And she's in a bad Way.

Id: [0x0007FAFE]
There's no time for a Vote. Thatch is outnumbered.

Id: [0x0007FAFF]
The crew'll understand.

Id: [0x0007FB00]
Beat to Quarters, Lads! We're sailing into Hell!

Id: [0x0007FB02]
I'll keep the Jackdaw circling.

Id: [0x0007FB09]
You stirred up a Nest of Trouble, Thatch!

Id: [0x0007FB0A]
In service of a noble Cause.

Id: [0x0007FB0B]
Medicines, I hope you mean!

Id: [0x0007FB0C]
Aye. A Galleon nearby. And if we crack these Lobsters quick, we might catch up to her.

Id: [0x0007FB0F]
Oh God! Some aid here! Edward! Please!

Ahhh!

Back to my Ship, quick as you Please! She'll not slip away now!

Id: [0x0007FB20]
Oh, this is too much!

Id: [0x0007FB23]
I'll see you back to your Jackdaw when the Smoke has cleared. But for now I need a Helmsman.

Id: [0x0007FB24]
Call it out!

Id: [0x0007FB25]
Loose the Mains! And head straight for that bloody Ship. We'll have our Medicines in little time at all.

Id: [0x0007FD3A]
Do it, Kenway! Pilot her straight at her Waist!

Id: [0x0007FD3C]
Ram her, Kenway! She'll limp away otherwise!

Id: [0x0007FD62]
Bonnet, you never did say how you came to find company with Thatch. I'm curious.

Id: [0x0007FD63]
Didn't I?

Id: [0x0007FD64]
I came upon his Vessel sitting dead in the Water, and finding him in such a poor way, I Liberated him from further Misfortune.

Id: [0x0007FD65]
Yes. Knowing little of maritime Life, it profits me best to relent to Thatch's Expertise.

Id: [0x0007FD66]
Ah. All part of your grand scheme, is it?

Id: [0x0007FD67]
Yes![Nervous laugh] Yes, my scheme!

Well, it's not a done Deal, by any Means. When the King hears my Complaints, I'm sure he'll come to a more sensible Conclusion.

Id: [0x0007FE49]
Yes. That I paid for Nassau's Restoration with my own Money. Fully three-fourths of the improvements made to that bloody Island, I funded by my private Fortune. And if that doesn't spell out my Commitment, then the King is a Fool.

It's a shaky Feeling sailing about with this much stolen Cargo.

Id: [0x000800AB]
Get used to it. We'll need to take a few more Prizes to make this a profitable Day.

Id: [0x000800AE]
Do you ever dream of the big Score? A Ship so full of Gold and Silver you just split it and sail Home?

Id: [0x000800AF]
Sure, but it's only a Dream. Every Man hopes to find a dozen Chests of Gold with no Owners, but they're as rare as an honest King.

Id: [0x000800C0]
Pardon the interruption, Sir, but my Partner's signaled at me. Seems your Cargo has been unloaded.

Id: [0x000800C1]
Excellent! I'll be on my way then. It's been a Treat transacting with you Lads.

Id: [0x000800C3]
And we've always more Cargo to sell, mind. This is Peter Beckford we're talking of! The most landed Sugar-man in the West Indies!

Id: [0x000800C4]
Aye... Heard you the first time.

Id: [0x000800C7]
Beauford. Manning. To me. We've done with this Place.

Id: [0x000800C8]
Aye, Sir. What's our Course?

Id: [0x000800C9]
We'll return to the Plantation and there take stock of our Inventory. It was a good Harvest this Year.

Id: [0x000800CA]
You might not talk so loud, Sir. This ain't anything like a friendly Port, ken?

Id: [0x000800CB]
Nonsense, Man. I had a delightful Conversation with a Chap just now. We came to quite an Understanding.

Id: [0x000800CC]
Even so, Sir. There's always one or two Rascals about. You know, Men looking to take what they haven't the Gumption to make by their own Effort.

Id: [0x000800CD]
Pirates, you mean?[laughs] I think you esteem their Ambitions too highly. Our Plantation is well guarded. My "connected" Friends have seen to that.

Id: [0x000800CE]
As you say, Sir.

Id: [0x000800D1]
Goodbye, All! And mark this Moment! The day you caught the Attention of your Betters, and took Steps towards a true Civilization.

I'd like to speak to the Man in Charge here. I require Entrance to the Warehouse!

Id: [0x000800DF]
Which of you Dogs has the Key to the Warehouse? Hm?

Id: [0x000800E0]
Is there no one sober here? Fetch me the Warehouse Key if you please!

Id: [0x000800E1]
The key, Goddammit! Someone find me the Key!

Id: [0x000800E2]
Kenway!

Id: [0x000800EB]
Ahoy Captain. We found a Trove of Nautical Maps and Ledgers and the Like scattered about the Village.

Id: [0x000800EC]
You'll find them sorted in the Captain's Quarters of the Jackdaw. Quality stuff.

Id: [0x000800ED]
Nautical maps and Ledgers? Might come in useful if we decide to build up a Fleet of our own.

Id: [0x000800EE]
Exactly my thinking, Captain. Have a look for yourself and tell me what you think.

Id: [0x000800F3]
Edward! Over here! I found Something.

Id: [0x000800F4]
You must see this!

Id: [0x000800F7]
I found Something else just here. I think you'll take to this Secret much faster.

Id: [0x000800F8]
Follow me.

Id: [0x000800F9]
Now this has the Makings of a Mystery.

Id: [0x000800FA]
What do you suppose lies at the Top?

Id: [0x000800FB]
From what I knew of Du Casse, wouldn't be surprised to find eclectic Instruments of Torture and Villainy. An Iron Maiden, or a Collection of Thumbscrews.

Id: [0x000800FC]
Or a Pear of Anguish!

Id: [0x000800FD]
[Laughs]

Id: [0x00080100]
My Father fought the Coromantees. One of the few to live to tell the Tale.

Id: [0x00080101]
That Cudjoe, he all the Warrior they make him out to be?

Id: [0x00080102]
[spits] I spit at his Name. And his Brothers, too. [spits two more times] But our War will be different. In our Time, we'll take this Land.

Id: [0x00080103]
How can we lose? They're fighting with scavenged Shot and living on Plantains. It'll be over in an Afternoon.

Id: [0x00080104]
Cheers Mate! That's the Spirit!

Id: [0x0008010E]
It's the lookout Men you really have to look out for.

Id: [0x0008010F]
Is that supposed to be funny?

Id: [0x00080110]
No, Man. You hear the Abeng Horn, you don't laugh, you run. See you coming from Miles away, they do. Catch you where you least expect it.

Id: [0x00080115]
Could we not simply starve them out?

Id: [0x00080116]
How? That Land is full of Boar and Fruit, and we need the Rivers as much as they do.

Id: [0x00080117]
Could we not take the Land then?

Id: [0x00080118]
Not according to Treaty.

Id: [0x00080119]
Treaty? [laughter] That's rich.

Id: [0x0008019B]
Jim! Hold off for God's sake!

Id: [0x0008019C]
Edward! What the Hell are you doing here?

Id: [0x0008019D]
I'm tailing these Men to the Sage. Can you hold off till he appears?

Id: [0x000801A0]
The Sage is here?

Id: [0x000801A1]
Aye. And Prins is leading us straight to him!

Id: [0x000801A2]
All right, Jaysus. I'll stay my Blade for a Time... but not long.

Id: [0x000801A5]
You couldn't help it, could you Kenway? Sticking your Nose into things you can't understand.

Id: [0x000801A7]
You're making me nervous, Kidd. Keep your Blades corked.

Id: [0x000801A9]
Just my bloody Luck. TWO major Targets, and I'm kept from killing 'em both.

Id: [0x000801AB]
Steady Jim. We're close. Don't worry.

Id: [0x000801AC]
Ah, I was not aware.

Id: [0x000801AF]
For Virtue, if nothing else.

Id: [0x00080220]
You weren't much of a Friend, Jack Rackham, nor an able Sailor neither... but you were strange and lively, and you made me laugh more than once... and that's enough to make me sorry for seeing you like this. I hope you've found a lasting Peace, down there among the Dead.

Id: [0x0008022D]
You spineless Cockrobin! Help her, for God's Sake.

Id: [0x00080230]
Fetch Help, somebody! Mary's ill! Somebody please!

Hush your Pie Hole, bloody Mick!

I'll follow these Gents. But you HANG BACK until I come find you.

Waterspout, Man. Steer wide!

Look out, Man!

Id: [0x00080335]
Is Thatch about?

Id: [0x0008034B]
She's disabled now, and taking on a decent Amount of Water. So keep your Cannons quiet, and take Care not to sink her.

Id: [0x0008034E]
Hold your Fire, Kenway! You don't want to sink your first Prize as Captain.

Id: [0x0008034F]
What are you doing, man? You'll send her to the Bottom!

Id: [0x00080350]
You'll sink her if you keep that up.

Id: [0x00080352]
Over the top, Lads! Kick 'em in the Hams and Give 'em a Taste of British Steel!

Id: [0x00080365]
Watch where you step, Boy!

Id: [0x0008036A]
You cocked up my Kill, Kenway!

Id: [0x0008036B]
For a better Cause!

Id: [0x0008036E]
You lost your Chance, Man. I'm going after Prins!

Id: [0x0008036F]
Kidd, No!

Id: [0x000803AB]
Oy, wasn't that Spanish Fella meant to come up here for a Visit? Torres or Something?

Id: [0x000803AC]
You didn't hear what happened? He was attacked by a couple Brigands on his way here. Buccaneers or the like. A nasty Business.

Id: [0x000803AD]
Jaysus. Is he all right?

Id: [0x000803AF]
Where is Master Prins? Hasn't come out of his Manor all day.

Id: [0x000803B0]
Still reeling from the Attack yesterday. Caused him quite a Fright from what I can tell.

Id: [0x000803B1]
Well it would, wouldn't it? Imagine that

Id: [0x000803B3]
I reckon I could have gone Home with her, if I hadn't been so Mean. But we had a Row, and I said something nasty about the Pope.

Id: [0x000803B4]
That's a bit daft, innit? You know she's Catholic.

Id: [0x000803B6]
The way I see it is, Sword Fighting is a little like making Love. It's not always what you do, but what you say.

Id: [0x000803B7]
A Pity for you, then. You're the most inarticulate Bugger I ever met.

Id: [0x000803B8]
Did you say Something, Boy? This ain't no Time for Chatter, you hear?

Id: [0x000803B9]
I ain't said Nothing, Sir. You got no quarrel with me.

Id: [0x000803BB]
You keep those goddamned Eyes on the Cane, all right? Look up once more and it'll be the last damn Thing you ever see!

Id: [0x000803BC]
No problem here, Sir. I'm working as best I can.

Id: [0x000803BE]
Put your back into it, Mongrel!

Id: [0x000803BF]
[Heavy sigh, angry but measured]

Id: [0x000803C0]
Oy! Marlowe! Mister Prins says to keep your Eyes peeled tonight! Says there's some Men about bent on making Trouble.

Id: [0x000803C1]
I'll spread the Word.

Id: [0x000803C2]
Any good Ones?

Id: [0x000803C3]
Aye. The best of them being we purchase ourselves a diving Bell, then go diving for Medicines off the Florida Coast.

Id: [0x000803C4]
It's a long Shot, that one.

Id: [0x000803C5]
Might be. But think on what else we might find with a Diving Bell on the Jackdaw.

Id: [0x000803C6]
A good Point.

Id: [0x000803C7]
But there's no going back now! So ram that Bastard! With all the Wind you've got!

Id: [0x000803D0]
Easy, Lads! Easy!

Id: [0x000803D8]
[Agonized grunt and laboured breathing]

Id: [0x000803DB]
Careful, Kenway. We're trying to board that Ship, not sink her.

Id: [0x000803DD]
Don't sink that Slaver's Ship, Kenway! There's hundreds of innocent Men aboard.

Id: [0x000803DE]
I know. I know!

Id: [0x000803EA]
If you don't mind me asking, Sir. What's the Meaning behind these Blood Samples we're taking?

Id: [0x000803EB]
Torres tells me that Blood is required for the Observatory to properly function.

Id: [0x000803EC]
How do you mean, Sir?

Id: [0x000803ED]
If one wishes to use the Observatory to, say... spy on King George, then one would require a Drop of the King's Blood to do so.

Id: [0x000803EE]
Does Torres mean to Spy on me then? For I've just given him a Sample of my Blood.

Id: [0x000803EF]
As have I, Captain Hornigold. As will all Templars. It is a Measure of Insurance.

Id: [0x000803F0]
And Trust, I reckon.

Id: [0x000803F1]
Yes, but fear not. Torres has shipped our Samples to a Templar Safehouse in Rio de Janeiro. We will not be the Observatory's first Subjects, I assure you.

Id: [0x000803F2]
Aye, Sir. I suppose it's a small Price to pay for what the Templars have given me in return.

Id: [0x000803F7]
What has happened here?

Id: [0x000803F8]
These were Men who resisted our generous Requests for Blood. Pirates and Privateers mostly.

Id: [0x000803FA]
I'm off to find Roberts.

Id: [0x000803FB]
Don't stay long. The Crew's getting restless out here.

Ah, e julgo que um dos navios mercantes da nossa frota necessita de um novo mastro. Há homens em terra neste momento em busca de uma árvore que sirva tal propósito.](Yes, sir. Very tidy, sir! We're only waiting for our Flagship to water and resupply before setting off. Oh, and I believe one of the Merchant Ships in our Company is in need of a new Mast. There's Men ashore scouting for a suitable Tree now.)

Captain, think carefully about what you mean to do here.

Id: [0x00080428]
What are you grousing about, Adé? It's Ben Hornigold come to kill us out there!

Id: [0x00080429]
Aye, and the Traitor needs to die. But what then? Can you say with certainty that you deserve the Observatory more than he and his Templars?

Id: [0x0008042D]
Thank you for hosting my little Send-off, Simpkins. I haven't been too Rambunctious, have I?

Id: [0x0008042E]
It is, I am Proud to say. Torres was a Governor too and, like me, had a firm Commitment to seeing Justice done.

Id: [0x00080431]
Bring a Doctor! The Governor is injured!

Id: [0x00080432]

Shall we sink his Ship, Captain? We've a better than even Chance!

No. There's a Device with him that needs taking. I'll have to board her myself.

Jaysus, Man. You don't do Nothing half-cocked.

How about a little Gunplay?

Id: [0x0008046F]
Are you weak against Bullets?

Id: [0x00080474]
What's this Torres doing looking for the Observatory when you're holding the Treasure yourself?

Id: [0x00080475]
Torres doesn't know I have it.

Id: [0x00080476]
So why bring it to him, and risk its Capture?

Id: [0x00080477]
Edward, there's a Fleet blocking the Cove we want.

Id: [0x00080479]
And you're going to do what exactly?

Id: [0x0008047A]
The Jackdaw is a Ship, Jenny. Not a Boat.

Id: [0x0008047B]
But did you always know?

Id: [0x0008047C]
Father... did you always know how to sail a Boat?

Id: [0x0008047D]
No. No, I learned after leaving Bristol.

Id: [0x0008047E]
After you left Mother?

Id: [0x0008047F]
Well, I didn't leave your...[Beat] I didn't leave without saying goodbye, that is. It was an Arrangement, you see? Between your Mother and me.

Id: [0x00080480]
She said you left her. She said you always talked about sailing a Boat and making Money in the New World.

Id: [0x00080481]
I did always want to Sail a Ship, that's true. But not for a Lark. To support us. To take care of her... and you.

Id: [0x00080482]
Not me. Mother said you didn't know about me. She said you wrote only once a Year, and that she never knew where to find you.

Id: [0x00080483]
That's all true. And I'm sorry for that. If I had known earlier... I don't know. I might have come Home. I hope that I would have.

Id: [0x00080484]
Well... you were busy. That's what I think.

Id: [0x00080485]
I was. But... that wouldn't have mattered.

Id: [0x00080486]
Can I steer your Boat?

Id: [0x00080487]
Boat? I see no Boat here. Do you?

Id: [0x00080488]
Ugh. I mean Ship, obviously. I don't see the Difference anyway.

Id: [0x00080489]
Ah! It's a very simple One, Jenny. A Ship can carry a Boat, but a Boat cannot carry a Ship.

Id: [0x0008048A]
Why, then everything is a Ship, large and small, but for my Toy Boat. The one I take into the Bath with me.

Id: [0x0008048B]
[Laughs]That's a clever Way of seeing it.

Id: [0x0008048C]
Is it hard to talk about Caroline, Jenny? About your Mother?

Id: [0x0008048D]
Hmmm.... no. She passed some Years ago. I miss her, but it's all right.

Id: [0x0008048E]
Was she in Pain?

Id: [0x0008048F]
I don't know. I don't think so. She was very happy for quite some Time. Then not so Happy. I didn't see her much after that. Then she was gone.

Id: [0x00080490]
I... I'm sorry.[Beat] I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

Id: [0x00080491]
It's all right. You're here now.[beat] And we're on an Adventure!

Id: [0x00080492]
[Laughs] Only a little One, I hope. I couldn't handle too many more Surprises.

Id: [0x00080493]
Do you think we'll see a Whale?

Id: [0x00080494]
Yes. There's a very good chance.

Id: [0x00080495]
Hm![beat] And what about Pirates? Will I see Pirates?

Id: [0x00080496]
No. There's not much chance of that, I think.

Id: [0x00080497]
Oh. That's rather sad. I should have liked to have see One.

Id: [0x00080499]
Tell you what, Jenny. As soon as these Winds die a little, I'll let you steer the Jackdaw. One little Trick at the Helm before Sundown.

Id: [0x0008049A]
[Cheers]Yay!

Id: [0x0008049C]

I am Grateful for your Geniality, Captain Hornigold. I assumed our Reception would be a troubled One.

Don't Mistake my Decorum for Deference, Governor. I'm eager to hear what you have to say, but of uncertain Mind otherwise.

Id: [0x00080676]
Very well put. And it's a fairer Shake than I expected to see from any Pirate. But I promise fair Treatment to all who hear me out.

Id: [0x00080677]
Only wait a while longer, Governor Rogers! These Rascals'll show their true Colours in Time.

Id: [0x00080678]
Calm, Commodore Chamberlaine. I have given Captain Hornigold my word that we will be Equitable.

Id: [0x00080679]
Aye, but the King has been particularly ineffective in bringing about this Change, hasn't he? And has failed at all Attempts until now.

Id: [0x0008067A]
[Optional line]Careful how you talk about His Majesty, Governor. You're here at His Pleasure.

Id: [0x0008067B]
I have my Methods, Commodore, and I expect you to honour them to the Letter!

Id: [0x0008067C]
Won't do you a Lick of Good! Men like him are a Blight on His Majesty's Reputation, and a peculiar Cancer afflicting the new World. The King wants them eradicated, above all else.

Id: [0x00080680]
Rackham! Vane! The Governor's come calling. Bring Burgess and Cockram as well!

Id: [0x00080682]
Commodore Chamberlaine, please see that all Merchants, Masons, and Carpenters are rounded up and brought to me this afternoon. We must see about repairing this Fortress.

Id: [0x00080683]
We should be confiscating weapons, Governor. Send these Pirates a clear, strong message that the King's Emissaries are not to be trifled with.

Id: [0x00080684]
I have no Wish to stir up Animosity here, Commodore. And though well-armed, we are outnumbered by a decent Margin. Slow Persuasion is our best and most efficient Weapon.

Id: [0x00080685]
Twaddle, Governor. We should sink every goddamn Ship not flying the King's Colours. To do otherwise projects a certain Weakness in our Bearing.

Id: [0x00080686]
Silence Commodore! I am the Goddamned Governor here, serving at the Kings pleasure, and I will make the bloody Decisions. Is that clear, Sir?

Id: [0x00080687]
Aye, Sir. Your Wishes are clear as Crystal.

Id: [0x00080689]
Disperse, the Lot of you. Make way for the King's Emissaries!

[FR] [Ah, ouais, ouais, cool. Ah c'est un endroit super, mais si tu réserves pas au moins six mois à l'avance, tu peux oublier.](Good. Good. This place is amazing, but if you don't make reservations six months ahead, you'll never get in.)

Id: [0x00080BB9]
Of genetic memory data? That's amazing.

Id: [0x00080BBA]
And this is through existing broadband networks. Straight into people's homes.

Id: [0x00080BBB]
Wow. This is going to change everything.

Id: [0x00080BBC]
Marketing. You want to know what I submitted?

Id: [0x00080BBE]
I said... "You should call your cloud computing system: CYBER-CRACK FOR INNOCENT CHILDREN." [Beat]You like it?

Id: [0x00080BC1]
[FR] [Hein? Oh Non…](What? No...)

Id: [0x00080BC2]
[FR] [Oui oui. Dès que le débit baisse, la vague disparaît. Il faut y aller au printemps ou au début de l'été.](Yeah, when the water drops, the wave disappears. You have to hit that in the spring or early summer.)

Id: [0x00080BC3]
[FR] [Merde. J'avais prévu d'en profiter toute la fin de semaine.](Dammit. I planned my whole weekend around this.)

Id: [0x00080BC4]
[FR] [Oh… Ok.. Cool. Eh ben, euh… on se verra là-bas.](Oh... cool. Well, I'll, uh... see you there.)

Id: [0x00080BC5]
[FR] [Ouais, à tout à l'heure.](Yeah, see you!)

Id: [0x00080BC6]
[Imitating a nasally voice]"Have you tried turning it off and back on again!" That's all he ever says when I have a problem.

Id: [0x00080BC7]
Have you alerted the Men? We're short on Time.

Id: [0x00080BC8]
Aye, there'll be two Soldiers waiting for us at the Crossroads.

Id: [0x00080BCA]
Very good.

Id: [0x00080BCC]
Where are the Soldiers, Captain Hornigold?

Id: [0x00080BE3]
Why, who chases me now, eh? Is it a Specter come to spook me? Or the gaunt Remains of a Man I sent to Hell!

Id: [0x00080BF0]
He's lobbing Mortar Shot on us!

Id: [0x00080BF1]
Careful of that Mortar fire!

Id: [0x00080BF2]
Steer clear of that, Captain!

Id: [0x00080BF3]
The way is blocked, Captain!

Id: [0x00080BF4]
We'll have to find another Path!

Id: [0x00080BF5]
Can't sail through here, Edward!

Id: [0x00080C00]
We'll have a hard Fight if Hornigold draws us any deeper into this Fog. We're nearing the "The Devil's Backbone".

Id: [0x00080C01]
You mean them Crags that look like the Backbone of a Beast?

Id: [0x00080C02]
Aye. [SP][El Espinazo del Diablo](The Devil's Backbone) the Spaniards call it.

Id: [0x00080C05]
The Winds are tossing him about like a Toy!

Id: [0x00080C06]
We can use that to get close.

Id: [0x00080C07]
If we're not dashed to Pieces as well.

Id: [0x00080C0A]
Can you do this, Breddah? Is your Heart up for it?

Id: [0x00080C0B]
Truth be told, I was hoping the Sea would swallow him up, and see the Job done for me.

Id: [0x00080C0C]
There's Hornigold. Get in close.

Id: [0x00080C16]
We've just enough Crew to Sail now. Let's take this Ship!

Id: [0x00080C67]
As you've likely seen, the Number of Merchants roving these Waters is three Score the Number of Military Ships.

Id: [0x00080C68]
Aye. Easy Purchase, but in small Doses.

Id: [0x00080C69]
Right. So to lure the Navy out of hiding, it's best to cause a bit of Mischief.

Id: [0x00080C6A]
Catch a few small Fish to attract the Big ones.

Id: [0x00080C6B]
That's right. So plunder and pillage as you see fit, Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x00080C7C]
Sail ho! Military-class Brig on the Horizon.

Id: [0x00080C7D]
Good Eye, Man.

Id: [0x00080C7E]
Are you ready for this, Kenway? For she won't go down without an honest Fight.

Id: [0x00080C7F]
Who's up for taking that Brig, Lads! Shout "Aye"!

Id: [0x00080C81]
That's a Sound I like to hear. Pipe to Quarters! All Hands to Cannons!

Id: [0x00080C85]
Careful around the Navy. They're as likely to ram you as fire a Broadside.

Id: [0x00080C86]
Let's test those Powder Barrels against them, shall we?

Id: [0x00080C87]
Aye. Good thinking.

Id: [0x00080C92]
So sharpen your cutlasses, shine your hooks, and sail with the "Devils of the Caribbean!"

Id: [0x00080C94]
This Virtual Experience has not been rated.

Id: [0x00080C95]
Can you find something to lower the platform?

Id: [0x00080C96]
You'll have to lower that platform, somehow.

Id: [0x00080C9C]
That was a Rumble, by God! How'd we fare?

Id: [0x00080C9D]
A fine Purchase, no Mistake! Now I think it's time to lay low and bribe our way back into Secrecy.

Id: [0x00080C9E]
Agreed. So how do we get rid of the Notoriety we've stirred up?

Id: [0x00080C9F]
Money, my Boy. A well placed Bribe to the right Government Official will see the Military off your Tail.

Id: [0x00080CA0]
Right. Let's do that. I'll need to meet these good Samaritans at some point.

Id: [0x00080CA1]
Smart thinking. 

Id: [0x00080CA4]
That Ship's a Monster! Look at the Size of her!

Id: [0x00080CA5]
Aye. And we'd not last long Face to Face with her. You hear that, Kenway? Keep your Distance, and we'll strike when Fortune favors us.

Id: [0x00080CA6]
Under Cover of Darkness, most likely.

Id: [0x00080CA7]
Aye, it may come to that.

Id: [0x00080CAB]
Bleeding Bastards! We'll have to deal with this Skirmish fast. Forget the Galleon and send these interlopers to Hell.

Id: [0x00080CB2]
Another bit of Wreckage, Captain. This is looking Grim.

Id: [0x00080CB3]
Aye. Keep your Eyes peeled.

Id: [0x00080CF2]
What's our Course, Captain?

Id: [0x00080CF3]
We're looking for Slave Ships. Any that work for the Royal African Company.

Id: [0x00080CF4]
You don't mean to traffic in Human Cargo now, do you?

Id: [0x00080CF5]
No. Jaysus, Adé. You know me better than that. We're only after Information. Looking to find where the Princess docks in her spare Time.

Id: [0x00080CF6]
The Princess... a slave ship?

Id: [0x00080CF7]
Aye. Blackbeard told me there was a good Chance we'd find the Sage aboard her.

Id: [0x00080CF8]
Captain. Vane's just sunk a Merchant Schooner.

Id: [0x00080CF9]
Damn! Can't that Animal stay the Course we agreed to?

Id: [0x00080CFB]
Damn that Captain Vane! He's unloading everything he has.

Id: [0x00080CFC]
He'll sink it if he's not careful. We'll get closer.

Id: [0x00080D00]
Keep wide of the Fort, Captain. Those Cannons have a long Reach.

Id: [0x00080D02]
If we time it right, we can use our Fort to our Advantage.

Id: [0x00080D03]
Keen thinking, Quartermaster!

Id: [0x00080D06]
You still in one Piece, Vane?

Id: [0x00080D07]
Chase those Bastards down, Kenway! I'll murder the Men who scuttled my Ship!

Id: [0x00080D08]
Keep calm, Mate. Remember what we're after!

Id: [0x00080D0A]
We're going over! Find the Captain!

Id: [0x00080D0D]
[Shock and Whimper as Roberts pokes him in the back with a gun] Ah!

Id: [0x00080D10]
The walls of this Canyon hug damn close, Captain. We'd best be quiet.

Id: [0x00080D13]
Ah, you see here? The Handiwork of Men born and bred to protect this place. The Guardians of the Observatory.

Id: [0x00080D14]
How long have their Kind been here?

Id: [0x00080D15]
Oh... at least a thousand Years or more. Dedicated Men. Very deadly.

Id: [0x00080D19]
You've got the Flag?

Id: [0x00080D1A]
Aye. And we're flying it now. This should do nicely.

Id: [0x00080D43]
The Chest they hauled ashore was full of empty Vials. Where's our Portuguese Captain?

Id: [0x00080D44]
He had outlived his Usefulness.

Id: [0x00080D45]
Where is he?

Id: [0x00080D46]
Sleeping soundly at the bottom of the Sea.

Id: [0x00080D47]
[Angry sigh]How many men must we kill for a Simple Prize?

Id: [0x00080D48]
As many as drift into our Path.

Id: [0x00080D52]
[PT][Ei, marujo! Continua!](Ahoy, Sailor! Carry on!)

[PT][Ei, aí! Aqui Está tudo bem.](Ahoy there! All is well.)

Id: [0x00080D5C]
You've cleared the Decks, but there are Pigeons still roosting in the Nests.

Id: [0x00080D5D]
I see them.

Id: [0x00080D68]
Gracious. What a revolting Sight!

Id: [0x00080D69]
Well they don't take kindly to Pirates here, do they? Wonder how many stolen Reales bought these men this Perch?

Id: [0x00080D6F]
Stop or I'll break your Knees when I catch ya!

Id: [0x00080D70]
I'm close at Heel, Shitbird!

Id: [0x00080D71]
Here I come!

Id: [0x00080D72]
Don't make me chase you into the Harbor!

Id: [0x00080D74]
You want a Dust-up, I'll give you one.

Id: [0x00080D75]
Come on Lads! I've seen bigger Arms on a Bird!

Id: [0x00080D76]
You'll have to hit harder than that!

Id: [0x00080D77]
I'm still standing, Lads!

Id: [0x00080D78]
One more! Come on!

Id: [0x00080D7C]
[SP][¡Vamos, daos prisa! ¡Que esto no es una posada!](Look lively, you! This isn't a Hostel!)

Id: [0x00080D7D]

Id: [0x00080D7F]
[SP][¿Dónde está esa maldita llave? ¿La has cogido tú?](Where is that damned Key? Did you take it?)

Id: [0x00080D94]
Governor Torres requests your Presence at the Docks near the Castillo, first thing tomorrow Morning.

Id: [0x00080D98]

Id: [0x00080DA7]
Steady up! And keep your Backs together, Lads! This Fight ain't over!

Id: [0x00080DA8]
I know this Bastard, and I've seen what he can do. He'll be after me, sure as I'm standing here!

Id: [0x00080DA9]
Some mighty piss-poor Sailing back there, Lads! And if we live out this Day, by God, I'm flaying every last Bitch of you!

Id: [0x00080DAA]
Hold your Ground! And be ready for anything!

Id: [0x00080DAC]
Go, Captain Kenway. The Way forward has not been cleared, and we are not yet safe.

Id: [0x00080DAD]
You haven't finished the Task I set for you. Go.

Id: [0x00080DAE]
Still more searching to be done. Still more killing.

Id: [0x00080DB1]
[SP][Por aquí, soldado. ¡Rápido!](This way, Soldier. Hurry!)

Id: [0x00080DB9]
I know his name, Aye. And I wish him all the best, you bleedin' Dago!

Id: [0x00080DBA]
[SP] (El Tiburón... this one is not cooperating.)

Id: [0x00080DBB]
You! Englishman... you sailed with Pirates, yes? You know of the Captaiin they call Kenway.

Id: [0x00080DBE]
Curse you Lot! And curse this bloody City! The Venice of the West Indies, they said! The jewel of Civilization? bah! Syphilization, more like! Yellow fever and Misery!

Id: [0x00080DC0]
Stay back! Stay back, or I'll shoot.

Id: [0x00080DC1]
Go on, Get!

Id: [0x00080DC3]
[screams in pain] Ah! Ahhh!

Id: [0x00080DD2]
So will you go Ashore, or will I swim you there myself?

Id: [0x00080DD3]
Lord, there's a bit of a Chill, isn't there?

Id: [0x00080DD5]
Hm. Thought we might see some Soldiers and the like. Maybe they've gone?

Id: [0x00080DD6]
No. They're here. Deep in the Jungle.

Id: [0x00080DD9]
They brought every ounce of Menace they had.

Id: [0x00080DDA]
Do you see them, Edward?

Id: [0x00080DDB]
Shhh. There's Spaniards up ahead.

Id: [0x00080DDF]
[SP](What have I seen! Oh God, what is this Place!)

Id: [0x00080DE3]
[SP](It's the Devil's Work! The Devil himself!)

Id: [0x00080DE6]
Holy Mother of God. Is this the Place we've come to see?

Id: [0x00080DE7]
Aye.

Id: [0x00080DE8]
It's all so strange. What is it?

Id: [0x00080DE9]
Later, Anne. I'll tell you all when this is finished.

Id: [0x00080DEC]
[SP](Leave me be!)

Id: [0x00080DED]
[SP](No, please!)

Id: [0x00080DEE]

[SP](Let me live!)

Id: [0x00080DF0]
Whoa!

Id: [0x00080DF2]
I'll find a way to help you up!

Id: [0x00080DF3]
There must be something...

Id: [0x00080DF4]
There has got to be a way to lower that platform.

Id: [0x00080DF5]
You ready? Let's go!

Id: [0x00080DF6]
Are you feeling all right?

Id: [0x00080DF7]
Hah. Exactly.

Id: [0x00080EF4]
How long have you been one of these Assassins, eh?

Id: [0x00080EF5]
No, Sir. Assassins and Templars have been at War for thousands of Years, all over the World.

Id: [0x00080F30]
Cheery bunch of Mates you've got.

Id: [0x00080F31]
You deserve Scorn, Edward. Prancing about like one of us, bringing Shame to our Cause.

Id: [0x00080F32]
And what is that?[Beat] Your Cause?

Id: [0x00080F33]
To be blunt... we kill People. Templars and their Associates. Folks who'd like to control all the Empires on Earth... claiming it's in the name of Peace and Order.

Id: [0x00080F34]
Sounds like Du Casse's dying Words.

Id: [0x00080F35]
You see? It's about Power really. About Lording over People. Robbing us of Liberty.

Id: [0x00080F36]
That another Message from one of your Friends?

Id: [0x00080F37]
Aye.[Beat] I'll show you.

Id: [0x00080F3B]
I know you ain't exactly impressed by our Creed. So would the Sight of Money make you more Friendly to our Ways?

Id: [0x00080F3C]
As ever.

Id: [0x00080F3D]
[Little laugh]Then work these Contracts around the West Indies for us, and we'll pay you. As simple as that.

Id: [0x00080F41]
Now follow on. I have one last Secret to share.

Id: [0x00080F72]
That's one. Couple Dozen more and you're in.

Id: [0x00080F75]
[SP][Los templarios estarán contentos con esto. Buen trabajo.](The Templars will be happy with this Take. Good work here.)

Id: [0x00080F76]
[SP][Siempre es un placer trabajar con el gobernador. Entre usted y yo, prefiero a un templario en el trono que al rey actual.](Always a Pleasure working with the Governor. Between you and me, I'd rather have a Templar on the Throne that the present King.)

Id: [0x00080F77]
[SP][Yo no diría eso en público, caballero. Nunca se sabe quién puede estar escuchando.](I'd not say that so loudly in Public, Sir. Never know who's listening.)

Id: [0x00080F78]
[SP][Lo siento, señor.](Apologies, Sir.)

Id: [0x00080F79]
[SP][De todas formas, seguro que les gusta escucharlo.](Still, they'll be pleased to hear it.)

Id: [0x00080F7B]
[SP][¿Algún problema con los Asesinos últimamente? ¿Algún asunto turbio?](Any trouble from the Assassins lately? Any funny Business?)

Id: [0x00080F7C]
[SP][Sí. Sabotearon un envío de pólvora. Las pérdidas fueron terribles.](Yes. They meddled with a previous Shipment of Powder. A frightful Loss of Gold, that one.)

Id: [0x00080F7D]
[SP][Mmm. Pediré a los templarios que te compensen.](Hmm. I'll ask the Templars about seeing you compensated.)

Id: [0x00080F7E]
[SP][Gracias, señor. Eso sería de gran ayuda.](Thank you, Sir. That would be a great Help.)

Id: [0x00080F80]
[SP][Lleva estos barriles al almacén del gobernador. ¡Hazlo tan rápido como puedas! ¡Vamos, vamos!](Take these Kegs to the Governor's Storehouse. Quick as you please! Hup hup!)

Id: [0x00080F81]
[SP][Rápido. Antes de que se ponga el sol, ¿entendido?](Hurry up now. Before the Sun sets, all right?)

Id: [0x00080F87]
You robbed the wrong Man, Mate. A Fella with dangerous Friends.

Id: [0x00080F8A]
Ah! Did you catch that Rogue?

Id: [0x00080F8B]
Aye. And I'll be buying the First round with the Money I pulled off him.[Laughs lightly]

Id: [0x00080F8C]
Oh! Ah... wonderful.

Id: [0x00080F8D]
All Hands ahoy! Bear-a-hand up and prepare to make Sail!

Id: [0x00080F8E]
Remember our Object, Lads. We're here to punch Holes in every Goddamned Pirate ship Anchored in the Northern Harbor!

Id: [0x00080F8F]
If you doubt the Honour of our Cause here... and if my disavowal of our Coward Governor's Wishes causes you Anxiety, then you are free to debark my Vessel and stay ashore!

Id: [0x00080F90]
But I will not stand idly by as the Rats scurrying about this Island plot and scheme to do us direct Harm!

Id: [0x00080F91]
So tumble up there, Men! Tumble up all! Prepare to Loose the Topsails!

Id: [0x00080F92]
That's right! Lay aloft, quick as you please!

Id: [0x00080F94]
Ready to loose the Topsails on my Signal.

Id: [0x00080F95]
All ready forward? Wait for my signal, please!

Id: [0x00080F97]
This is a Score too big to miss, Kenway. Sail after him!

Id: [0x00080F9A]
It's a Risk to anchor too close. The Soldiers roving the Plantation would catch us for sure.

Id: [0x00080F9B]
Drop here, then, and sneak ashore. We'll look after the Jackdaw.

Id: [0x00080F9E]
Sorry, Sir. Been a hot Day.

Id: [0x00080F9F]
There was a dodgy Ship following close behind my own Vessel today. And It would be a shame if the Rapscallions aboard her were to slip ashore, right under your nose, only because you couldn't stand the Bloody heat!

Id: [0x00080FA0]
Apologies, Sir. I'll keep my Eyes peeled.

Id: [0x00080FA2]
For God's Sake, what the Hell is going on here today? How do you suppose you'll be able to Ring that Alarm if you're piss drunk and barely able to stand?

Id: [0x00080FA3]
Forgive me, Sir. I am fit and able. And if I see any Strangeness about, you'll hear the Bell ringing straight away. I Promise.

Id: [0x00080FA5]
You up there! Look alive, Man! You've a Job to do!

Id: [0x00080FA8]
[SP][¡Deberías habernos dejado dispararte, capitán Contreras! Ahora te colgarán hasta que mueras.](Should have let us shoot you, Captain Contreras! Now you'll be stretched until dead.)

Id: [0x00080FA9]
What's he saying?

They mean to hang this one, I think. Seems they shot his Friend first.

Id: [0x00080FAB]
Looks like they're enjoying this, Bastards.

Id: [0x00080FAF]
I think I see something out there!

Id: [0x00080FB0]
Don't be daft. The Fog plays Tricks on the Eye, that's all.

Id: [0x00080FB2]
The Wheel is yours, Captain.

Id: [0x00080FB4]
This is as far as she'll go, Captain.

Id: [0x00080FB5]
Then I'll have to go on without her.

Id: [0x0008103D]
That's unsettling. To think we're not even safe where we work.

Id: [0x0008103E]
I know. Two months ago I left a couple books on my desk, and they disappeared for a few days.

Id: [0x0008103F]
Stolen?

Id: [0x00081040]
Well, someone returned them a few days later with a little note that said "Thanks!" But still, scary.

Id: [0x00081041]
Hm. Not quite the same, though, is it?

Id: [0x00081042]
Erudito?

Id: [0x00081043]
No, the hacker here. At Abstergo.[Pause] Who's Erudito?

Id: [0x00081044]
It's just that group, you know? They like to... uh...[trails off]

Id: [0x00081045]
Like to what?

Id: [0x00081046]
Ah... n-nothing.

Id: [0x00081047]
[FR][Tu travailles pas sur Ezio Auditore ?](You're not working Ezio Auditore?)

Id: [0x00081048]
[FR][Non, je suis sur Aveline.](No, I'm on Aveline.)

Id: [0x00081049]
[FR][Ah ouais... Ben moi, j'ai reçu un mémo me disant d'arrêter mes recherches sur les dernières années d'Ezio pour me concentrer uniquement sur les moments où il est en contact avec ces artéfacts de merde… Quelle perte de temps.](Ah, right. Well, I got this memo telling me to stop researching Ezio's later years and focus on only those specific moments where he comes into contact with these ridiculous artifacts... total waste of my time.)

Id: [0x00081055]
How old is this technology?

Id: [0x00081056]
Dates back to the late 70s, I think. There are some recordings from that era on our servers if you're curious. Just poke around the archives. You'll find them.

Id: [0x0008105A]
[FR][Ah, ouais. Comme une scène de film, jte comprends. Ce serait tellement mieux que la réalité.](Ah, yeah. To give it a more cinematic feel, I agree. Real life can be so dull.)

Id: [0x0008105B]
Oh come on!

Id: [0x0008105C]
No, no, no, no. Be patient...

Id: [0x0008106D]
You didn't hear? Someone was killed this morning. In the office. Some guy from IT.

Id: [0x0008106E]
Killed? How?

Id: [0x0008106F]
Security did it... they SHOT him!

Id: [0x00081070]
God. What... what was he doing.

Id: [0x00081071]
Just working in the server rooms, making photocopies or something. That what I heard.

Id: [0x00081072]
Damn.

Id: [0x00081073]
Mm, I'm really looking forward to it. I love pirates, and this whole Edward Kenway thing sounds amazing.

Id: [0x00081074]
Yeah, it's been great. Some of the people here have captured some great footage. All it needed was some little polishing.

Id: [0x00081075]
You know what would be even better than a virtual pirate experience? A pirate versus ninja story. Amazing right?

Id: [0x00081076]
Totally. Yes.

Id: [0x00081077]
Doesn't really matter anymore, does it? With our surrogate data systems we can visit anyone's genetic memories now.

Id: [0x00081078]
True.

Id: [0x00081079]
Where would go if you could?

Id: [0x0008107A]
Mm, I don't know. Maybe Manchester in the late seventies. Or New York in the early eighties. Lot of bands Id like to see.

Id: [0x0008107B]
That's it? What about the Mongolian empire in the thirteenth century?

Id: [0x0008107C]
Oh! Or the nineteen forties. I'd love to see the premier of Citizen Kane.

Id: [0x00081080]
Odd looking Things, aren't they? Old and weathered.

Id: [0x00081082]
Are you good with Riddles, Edward?[Beat] Puzzles and Ponderings and the Like?

Id: [0x00081083]
No worse than the next Man. Why?

Id: [0x00081084]
I think you've a natural Gift for it.[Beat] The Way you think and work. The Way you understand the World.

Id: [0x00081085]
Well I don't know about that. You're talking in Riddles now, and I don't understand a Word.

Id: [0x00081086]
Clamber on top of this Thing here, will you?[Beat] Help me solve Something.

Id: [0x0008108C]
S'pose I could. If it leads me to the other four Keys.

Id: [0x0008108E]
A bad Excuse is better than none at all.

Id: [0x00081094]
Come on, Man!

Id: [0x00081095]
It's good, innit?

Id: [0x00081098]
Here we are. What do you think?

Id: [0x00081099]
I think Monsieur Du Casse was a man of Many Secrets.

Id: [0x0008109A]
Aye, and look here: a solid Staircase leading God knows where.

Id: [0x0008109D]
Couple years now. I met Ah Tabai in Spanish-town, and there was something about him I trusted. A sort of Wisdom.

Id: [0x0008109E]
Is all this his Idea? His Clan?

Id: [0x0008109F]
The Natives of this New World had a Philosophy like our Creed for as long as they've been here. And when Europeans arrived, our Groups sort of... matched up.

Id: [0x000810A0]
Cultures and Religions and Languages keep Folks divided... but there's something in the Assassin's Creed that crosses all Boundaries. A Fondness for Life and Liberty.

Id: [0x000810A1]
Sounds a bit like Nassau, no?

Id: [0x000810A2]
[Short laugh]Close. But not quite.

Id: [0x000810A3]
And what will this Effort gain me?

Id: [0x000810A4]
Respect, for a Start. From the Men and Women you put in Danger here.

Id: [0x000810A6]
And if that ain't enough,[Beat] there's a Treasure behind that Door. Something many Centuries old.

Id: [0x000810A7]
I reckon if you made the Effort to find every last one of those, it'd be worth your While.

Id: [0x000810A8]
So, you sailing back to Nassau?

Id: [0x000810A9]
When I have another Contract there, aye. But this is my Home for now.

Id: [0x00081B94]
[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x00081B95]
[Spits]

Id: [0x00081B96]
[Sounds of effort]

Id: [0x00081B98]
[Effort Sound]

Id: [0x000827D6]
Hey!

Id: [0x000827E0]
Duncan, you know the Assassins best. What will be their Strategy?

Id: [0x000827E1]
Kill or be Killed, I imagine.

Id: [0x000827E2]
This is no Time for Jesting!

Id: [0x000827E5]
Something is Wrong. Stay close, Grandmaster!

Id: [0x000827E6]
I feel it too. Do not let them get their Hands on the Sage! At whatever Cost!

Id: [0x000827EA]
A Pity we have been discovered, eh, Duncan? These Assassins must be confused by your Appearance here.

Id: [0x000827EB]
Confused, aye. More than a little, I'd say.

Id: [0x000827EE]
One of your early Letters mentioned a Desire to kill the Mayan Mentor, Ah Tabai. Were you able to carry out this Contract before coming here?

Id: [0x000827EF]
I... I was not, no. Too many... complications along the way.

Id: [0x000827F0]
A Pity. But the Maps you delivered with this Vial will see that Job finished.

Id: [0x000827F1]
Aye. That's the Idea.

Id: [0x000827F2]
Enough Prattling! We must be quiet and cautious, or everyone dies!

Id: [0x000827F3]
Assassins!

Id: [0x000827F4]
Above! They're on the Rooftops!

Id: [0x000827F5]
Watch the Streets and Alleys. They could be anywhere!

Id: [0x000827FA]
I've made my Choice, Adé.[beat] I'm calling her the Jackdaw, for a sly Bird I loved as a Child back in Swansea.

Id: [0x000827FB]
A dark little Creature, no?

Id: [0x000827FC]
Did it rub you wrong when I took this Brig as my own?

Id: [0x000827FD]
Rest and Repast would do us Good before Nassau. Water for Drinking. And Hunting for Food and Repairs.

Id: [0x000827FE]
Well reasoned, Sir. Hunting it shall be. We'll find a decent Place to drop Anchor.

Id: [0x00082DD9]
[laughs] It was the sort of Rub I have learned to endure sailing among Faces of such... Fairness.[he toys with the word "Fairness"]

Id: [0x00082DDA]
[Laughs at the joke] It's true, most of these Men wouldn't accept you as a Captain.[beat] So what fair Role would complement such Unfairness?

Id: [0x00082DDB]
I'll be your Quartermaster. Nothing less.

Id: [0x00082DDC]
All right. And as Quartermaster, have you any immediate Counsel for this tyro Captain?

Id: [0x00083166]
Come on Tad! You’ve had your Fill. Stop blubbering and get back to the ship.

Id: [0x00083167]
Just one more, Jimmy, just one more in memory of her!

Id: [0x00083168]
All right, all right. I'll fetch us another. One Mug each.

Id: [0x0008316C]
Bastard!

Id: [0x0008316E]
Help! This One's a Killer!

Id: [0x0008316F]
He's fixing to murder me!

Id: [0x00083170]
Damn you, Man!

Id: [0x00083171]
Go on now! Let fall the Sails and Go!

Id: [0x0008317F]
What's happening there?

Id: [0x00083181]
[SP][Cuidado, podría volver a explotar.](Careful, it may explode again!)

Id: [0x00083182]
[SP][¡Traed agua! ¡Deprisa!](Bring some Water! Hurry up!)

Id: [0x000831AC]
Damn, man! How is it you're a woman!?

Id: [0x000831AD]
Christ Edward, is that something that needs explaining?[Beat] Now, I'm here to do a Job. I'll let you be amused later.

Id: [0x000831C4]
I spied a few Items in the Hold earlier... Powder and a few Pistols. I think I'll fashion a second Holster if I can.

Id: [0x000831C9]
Here we are. Take that Stone you discovered from the Mayan Stele, and put it there.

Id: [0x000831CA]
Surely our superior Weapons give us the upper hand.

Id: [0x000831CB]
Maybe. Still, I say, you hear that Horn, you're in trouble.

Id: [0x000831D0]
Cockpits, you say?

Id: [0x000831D1]
The Highlands, furrowed through.

Id: [0x000831D2]
Furrowed, now?

Id: [0x000831D3]
Earthquakes, man. They attack from Ravines and Gaps and Caves and Fissures made by Earthquakes.

Id: [0x000831D4]
[laughter] "Cockpits."

Id: [0x000831D5]
Laugh all you want. It's your Funeral. I've heard the Stories. I'm not getting caught.

Id: [0x00083648]
[Laughs]It's a good Start.

Id: [0x00083649]
One you find laughable?

Id: [0x0008364B]
They've been sent to kill these four Targets.

Id: [0x0008364F]
So a Governor no longer. What keeps you active these Days?

Id: [0x00083650]
Projects... Projects very... personal in Nature.

Id: [0x00083651]
That sounds devious.

Id: [0x00083652]
Not terribly. Most of my Work is charitable. I am proud to say I have recently secured Funding for a Hospital in Havana.

Id: [0x00083654]
My goodness, you are a soft Heart, Torres. Here we are, of roughly equal Age, and yet - while you scurry about throwing Money at all manner of Quibbles - I am content to simply relax and rejoice in my earned Fortune.

Id: [0x00083655]
To each his own Defects, [SP][Señor](Mister) Prins.

Id: [0x00083658]
I grow tired of this Walk. We must be close.

Id: [0x00083659]
Yes, just here. We must be on equal Footing you see? I don't trust Templars any more than you must trust me.

Id: [0x0008365A]
Well, if I had known you were so skittish, I'd have brought you a Bouquet of Flowers.

Id: [0x0008365B]
Ah, I don't know why I bother... for the Money, I suppose. The vast Sums of Money.

Id: [0x0008365E]
Could we talk a Moment about the Condition of the Ship?

Id: [0x0008365F]
What's the Trouble?

Id: [0x00083661]
I had a walk about the Gundeck this Morning, and couldn't stand for what I saw. A Clutter of Linstocks heaped like Tinder... and one with a Slowmatch still burning.

Id: [0x00083662]
Christ.

Id: [0x00083663]
And just nearby, two Barrels of Gunpowder closer than Man and Wife, fit to explode at the Touch of a Spark.

Id: [0x00083664]
We'll stow ours, good and proper.

Id: [0x00083665]
As for the Cannons, they might as well be tossed. Clogged Touch-holes in need of Scraping; corrosion on the Bodies; Barrel Swabs as naked as Knives; and Breech-ropes so rotted I could use them for knitting Yarn.

Id: [0x00083667]
The Short of it is, we need good Equipment, kept in fine Condition. For we cannot win every Battle with Sneers and Shouts. So worry about your own Armaments when it suits you. But don't forget about your Jackdaw as well.

Id: [0x00083668]
No, indeed. We'll make it a point to keep this Ship and its Crew in fine Condition.

Id: [0x0008366A]
In Madagascar, I offered those Pirates a Choice... take a Pardon and return to England penniless but free Men, or be hanged by the Neck until dead.

Id: [0x0008366B]
[Laugh]It's not like you to gloat, Rogers.

Id: [0x0008366C]
[Laughs]We all deserve a Moment, don't we?

Id: [0x0008366D]
Governor, when you hunted Pirates in Madagascar, what Methods worked best?

Id: [0x0008366E]
I believe it was my Charisma that persuaded them. Violence and Threats should always be a last Resort.

Id: [0x0008366F]
Just as you did in Nassau.

Id: [0x00083670]
Precisely. A pity Commodore Chamberlaine did not live to see my thorough Success.

I'll rise up when I'm good and ready, take the island for myself. Then all the world will know my name. Captain Mancomb Seepgood, terror of the high seas.

Id: [0x00083CAE]
Who'd dare challenge me? I can't imagine such a man. I don't believe such a One exists.

Id: [0x00083F16]

Id: [0x00083F18]

Got you, Maggots!

Id: [0x00083F33]
Ha ha!

Id: [0x00083F34]
Our Treasure must be aboard that Galleon. Why don’t you take the Ship itself and save us a bit of Time?

Id: [0x00083F3D]
Let’s move, Kenway!

Id: [0x00083F3E]

Lot of sour Blood between them two, Rogers and Chamberlaine. What’s the Issue?

Id: [0x00083F4B]
The Commodore don’t think much of Civilians, I reckon. And there’s a Rumour going 'round that Rogers is some kind of Jacobite. Or worse, that he’s a Catholic.

Id: [0x00083F4C]
[Laughs]O, I could think of worse!

Id: [0x00083F4E]
I heard the Commodore ranting and raving about Woodes Rogers, calling him a Heathen and whatnot. What’s happened to set them two off?

Id: [0x00083F4F]
Hush, Man! You don’t want the Governor’s Ire brought down on you. He’s a mysterious Sort.

Id: [0x00083F50]
Well, I’m much more afeared of the Commodore, in Truth. He’s a serious Chap. No sense of Humour.

Id: [0x00083F51]
I'll not fight where you have the Advantage, Lad.

Id: [0x00083F52]
Let's take this where all Men are Equal!

Id: [0x00083F76]
Aye. We're on Alert 'cause of some visiting Spaniard. Toreador or Torres or something.

Id: [0x00083F78]
Who the Hell is this Princock Spaniard we're meant to be escorting? I don't want Nothing to do with them Dagos.

Id: [0x00083F79]
Shhh! Keep your Voice down, Man! He's Mates with Governor Rogers!

Id: [0x00083F7A]
Is he? That's well odd.

Id: [0x00083F7C]
Do you know what I heard? Governor Rogers and Captain Hornigold are part of a secret Society, like. A secret Order that's made up of Frenchies and Spaniards and Italians and even some Turks.

Id: [0x00083F7D]
[Laughs]Oh yeah? And the World's as Flat as a griddle Cake too, is it? [Laughs]Oh, come off it, Man. Stop listening to them Beggars.

Id: [0x00083F7F]
Captain Hornigold was a Pirate once. Did you know that?

Id: [0x00083F80]
Ah, I thought as much. The Man looks like he's been keel-hauled once or twice already.

Id: [0x00083F90]
Jim, stop!

Id: [0x00083F91]
Not this time, Kenway!

Id: [0x00083F93]
Come on, Man! We can work this together!

Id: [0x00083F94]
You had your Chance!

Id: [0x00083F96]
Stay your Blade, Kidd!

Id: [0x00083F97]

I mean you no Harm, you Corker! Now let's work this out like Gentlemen!

Id: [0x00083F9D]
Ah. God I've got a bleedin' Headache on account of your Jabbering. Now stay back and let me live in Peace!

Id: [0x00083F9E]
I would if you'd stop filching the Food I gather, and the Water I find!

Id: [0x00083F9F]

Come out, you Bastard!

Id: [0x00083FBB]
What's the Hold-up, Duncan?

Id: [0x00083FBC]
Shall we carry on?

Id: [0x00083FBD]
Have we altered our Plans?

Id: [0x00083FBE]
Are we waiting on Something?

Id: [0x00083FBF]
We're not far, I promise.

Id: [0x00084010]
Or we can ask these Ladies for their Aid... if I can't find a Subtler way in.

Id: [0x00084012]
What's happened here, Mate? I saw a Couple of Lads prancing around in the King's Colours.

Id: [0x00084013]
That Prussian Pretender's sending Soldiers to Kick us about! Saying we got no Business here!

Id: [0x00084014]
What'll we do, 'Lizabeth? I'll be hanged for Piracy if them Soldiers catch Hold of me.

Id: [0x00084015]
Stand your Ground and give 'em a Whallop, then! You got naught else to live for!

Id: [0x00084016]
What's all this Pissing and Moaning about? Has something happened?

Id: [0x00084017]
Soldiers have come, that's what's happened. Sent by the King himself.

Id: [0x00084018]
If a Lobster sticks his Nose in my Business, I'll slice it off, I swear I will! Ain't nobody sending me home, and ain't nobody telling me how to live.

Id: [0x0008401A]

Id: [0x0008401C]

Id: [0x0008401E]
No lollygagging, hear? Let's move!

Id: [0x0008401F]
The Commodore awaits, Gentlemen. And we'll not disappoint!

Id: [0x0008406B]
Gather those two Men there!

Id: [0x0008406D]
You Lads! Follow and Lay aboard. The Commodore has a Job for you.

Id: [0x0008406F]
Sir! We have Information for the Commodore. An urgent Matter.

Id: [0x00084070]
Carry on.

Id: [0x00084072]
Take Positions and prepare to decamp on the Commodore's Orders!

Id: [0x00084073]
Aye, Sir!

Id: [0x0008407E]
Our initial reports gave us hope that Ezio Auditore would serve as an ideal candidate for future Abstergo Projects. His charisma, sexual magnetism, and wry humor gave him all the qualities of a leading man. However, his corruption by the Assassin order robbed him of these qualities as he fell deeper and deeper into a spiral of revenge.

Id: [0x00084081]
As Ezio aged, we found in him all the vileness of a true fascist: glorifying war and violence while driven by a blind hatred for one of the most tolerant Popes the Catholic church has ever known.

Id: [0x00084085]
Ezio was frequently known to articulate a passive acceptance of evil.

Id: [0x00084089]
He was also a man of ugly contradictions – one who preached free-thought, yet traveled well beyond his home country to proselytize his corrupted Creed, just as he is doing here with this impressionable Chinese girl. Notice, too, that in his gestures and bearing there is still something of the old lecher in him.

Id: [0x0008408D]
Ezio's entire personality is built around pure demagoguery... claiming his philosophy is about love when violence and coercion are his primary means of tackling problems. We have therefore come to the conclusion that Ezio Auditore da Firenze would be a risky property to develop.

Id: [0x00084090]
Our initial research into the life of Ratonhnhaké:ton focused on a period spanning his late teens to his early thirties.

Id: [0x00084092]
But our researchers came away unimpressed by his calm and stoic demeanor, with occasional flashes of extreme anger. This was not the sort of leading man we felt comfortable endorsing.

Id: [0x00084094]
We decided, therefore, to delve into his early childhood with the hope that scenes of pre-Colonial America might hold some appeal.

Id: [0x00084096]
As you can see here, there is a certain naïve charm and innocence to this young boy.

Id: [0x00084098]
Unfortunately, our researchers found this young man's story deeply problematic as well... for one, the omnipresence of the Mohawk culture lacks the balance necessary to tell the true story of America.

Id: [0x0008409A]
And secondly, the Mohawk language would certainly be an issue for most of our audience. We therefore feel that although Ratonhnhaké:ton early life would be of some interest to our more educated viewers, it is unlikely that his story would appeal on a broader scale... being too “foreign,” as it were, to normal audiences. Our team recommends we PASS on our property.

Id: [0x0008409F]
Ah, that's Bollocks, that is! I've been here a Year and something already.

Id: [0x000840A1]
We're under-weigh, Roberts. So what's your Plan?

Id: [0x000840A2]
The Flagship of this Fleet is transporting a valuable Treasure in a large Chest. Crystal Vials filled with Blood. You may remember.

Id: [0x000840A3]
We're chasing Drams of Blood! Is that all?

Id: [0x000840A4]
I asked you to follow my Instructions to the Letter, Captain. But I did not give you Leave to question why.

Id: [0x000840A5]
I want those Blood Vials intact. And if that does not happen, we part as Enemies. Do you understand?

Id: [0x000840A6]
I'll try to, aye.

Id: [0x000840AB]
Those Sailors are carrying something ashore, Captain. A very large chest. Could be the Prize we're after.

Id: [0x000840AD]
Hm. Perhaps you should go Ashore, Captain Kenway. Find that Chest. And if it contains the Prize I seek, bring it here.

Id: [0x000840AE]
Aye. That's the way I'd play it.

Id: [0x0008431C]
He said it marked the Locations of "Assassin" encampments.

Id: [0x00084339]
Fancy seeing you here, Kenway, still looking Sleek and Mean.[Beat] Did you steal that Costume from a Dandy in Havana?

Id: [0x0008433A]
No, Sir. I found this on a Corpse... one that was walking about and talking Shite to my face only Moments before.

Id: [0x0008433B]
Ah...

Id: [0x00084343]
I know my Targets by Sight well enough. But how will I find them?

Id: [0x00084344]
We have Spies and Informants in every City. Visit our Bureaus, and the Assassins there will guide you.

Id: [0x00084345]
That fixes Torres and Rogers... but Bartholomew Roberts won't be near any City. Might take Months to find him.

Id: [0x00084346]
Or years. But you are a man of Talent and Quality, Captain Kenway. I believe you will find him.

Id: [0x00084347]
Quartermaster. What's our present Course?

Id: [0x00084348]
Due West, Captain. If it's still Kingston we're sailing for.

Id: [0x00084349]
It is indeed, Miss Bonny. Call it out.

Id: [0x00084544]
What of Thatch, Sir? Did he fall?

Id: [0x00084546]
Captain?

Id: [0x00084548]
He drinks Damnation.

Id: [0x0008454E]
[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x0008454F]
Hello?

Id: [0x00084550]
Lads? Lieutenant? You out here?

Id: [0x00084551]
Jenkins. What's the News?

Id: [0x00084553]
There was a Deserter among them who recalled my Face. I sliced into his Gullet before any Word left his Lips.

Id: [0x00084555]
Anybody see you?

Id: [0x00084556]
Don't think so, Sir. But I reckon Kenway suspects something. He don't miss much.

Id: [0x00084559]
What was that?

Id: [0x0008455B]
You certain you didn't bring some of those sand Rats in tow, Jenkins?

Id: [0x0008455C]
Look sharp. Stevens, make certain there's no Surprises.

Id: [0x0008455D]
Aye, sir.

Id: [0x0008455E]
Secure the other Side and watch the path.

Id: [0x0008455F]
Aye.

Id: [0x00084562]
Uh... Nothing here. Oh, Why is it always me sent into the Muck?

Id: [0x00084565]
Stay here. Shoot anything that moves.

Id: [0x00084566]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x00084567]
Come on. It's Time.

Id: [0x0008456B]
Tell me about the Beach.

Id: [0x0008456C]
A fair Gathering, sir. Most too drunk to stand.

Id: [0x0008456D]
That will suit our Purpose.

Id: [0x0008456F]
Thought for a Moment I'd die there. Bloody Savages.

Id: [0x00084570]
Have no Fear, Soldier. This will be the End of them.

Id: [0x00084572]
Quickly, send the Signal. And remember always this Day.

Id: [0x00084575]
What?!

Id: [0x00084576]
Get him!

Id: [0x00085008]
Everyone on my new team is named Ben. Two Benoits, a Benjamin and Bénédicte, who you know already.

Id: [0x00085009]
Sounds confusing.

Id: [0x0008500A]
Can't go wrong with a few good Bens.

Id: [0x0008500C]
Can you believe how beautiful this building is?

Id: [0x0008500D]
It's not thirty degrees at one end of the building and five at the other.

Id: [0x0008500E]
Coffee was better in the old building.

Id: [0x00085010]
You were late again this morning. What's going on?

Id: [0x00085011]
I know, I know. I've just... I've been spending too long in my Animus and it's doing my head in.

Id: [0x00085015]
Did you see that detail out front this morning? Security guys?

Id: [0x00085016]
Yeah. Dressed like riot police. Grabbing people's IDs.

Id: [0x00085017]
They checked mine three times between the parking garage and my desk.

Id: [0x00085019]
Have either of you seen André?

Id: [0x0008501A]
Now that you mention it, no. Not for a while.

Id: [0x0008501B]
His cubicle is near mine. I haven't seen him for weeks.

Id: [0x0008501D]
What's with this memo we got last week? Is it for real?

Id: [0x0008501E]
The one about artifacts or something?

Id: [0x0008501F]
I didn't get one. What is it?

Id: [0x00085021]
God, did I make a mistake last week. Sticking my nose where I shouldn't have.

Id: [0x00085022]
What happened?

Id: [0x00085023]
Is THAT what happened? I saw them asking you questions.

Id: [0x00085025]
I was looking at the job board yesterday. Some really interesting positions have opened up in New York, Paris, London and Tokyo.

Id: [0x00085026]
Yeah, I saw that. I don't know. I'm not into Abstergo Industries. I'm happy here.

Id: [0x00085027]
Salaries are much higher in those offices.

Id: [0x0008502A]
It's been mental around here the last few weeks.

Id: [0x0008502B]
Do you know what happened? I heard there was a break in?

Id: [0x0008502C]
No, it was a disgruntled employee. He tried to steal his animus.

Id: [0x0008502E]
Everything feels back to normal.

Id: [0x0008502F]
Yeah. Cost over-runs, late milestones, general confusion and exhaustion.

Id: [0x00085030]
It's good to be back.

Id: [0x00085032]
So how was the experience? How would you rate it overall?

Id: [0x00085033]
I had fun. It was colourful, action packed, exciting... and it had real heart. Real emotion. I'd definitely do it again.

[after a beat] Fine. I'll deal with it.

Keep it to 3 hours sessions, like the regulations say. They don't make these rules for no reason.

Id: [0x00085549]
Damn.

That's enough to trigger a bleeding effect, man. You need to be cautious. They've made progress on that front, but there's always a danger.

Id: [0x00085568]
I wish I could say this was illegal but... they actually have a legal right to do this.

Id: [0x00085569]
Really?

Yeah. With the highest levels of security clearance from seventeen different countries, Abstergo actually has a legal right to arrest and detain people too. It's crazy.

It's this big list of items we're supposed to be looking for while we're doing our research. Thing is, most of these things are bullshit, aren't they? Apples, Shrouds, Crystal Skulls, Memory Seals...

Id: [0x00085570]
[Laughs]Sounds like the inside of a conspiracy freak's closet.

Id: [0x00085571]
Poking around the servers I found a small bit of sequenced data on Joan of Arc. Minutes after loading it up, security was at my desk.

Id: [0x00085572]
Yeah. They confiscated my Animus key, and now my position here is "under review".

Id: [0x00085573]
Are you kidding? That's...[Beat] that's... scary.

Id: [0x00085574]
Yeah, but you actually have to work for it.

Id: [0x00085575]
[Laughs]

Id: [0x0008557E]
You cant steal an animus. They're all dummy terminals. Connected to the cloud servers.

Id: [0x0008557F]
Well, if he's an idot, that wouldn't stop him from trying.

Id: [0x00085580]
I think I preferred the security lock-down. At least then I knew I wasn't the one fucking up.

Id: [0x00085581]
Oh yeah, definitely.

[FR][Directeur de création ? Calice ! Plutôt directeur de rien foutre. Il faisait rien. Avec moi, les choses auraient été différentes dans cette compagnie.](Chief Creative Officer? Câlice! More like Chief Lazy Hipster. He didn't do anything. I'd turn this company around.)

Id: [0x00085586]
No way. He flew to Chicago for the annual shareholder's meeting and just vanished. Never even showed up to the meeting.

Id: [0x00085587]
Where did you hear that? I haven't heard anything.

Id: [0x00085588]
I keep my ear to the ground. I have connections.

Id: [0x0008559A]

Id: [0x0008559B]
Oh man. Maybe that's why my stomach hurts today.

Id: [0x0008559C]
I guess they found a couple dead rats in one of the filters. You better get that checked out.

Id: [0x0008559D]
Don't tell me that. Seriously.

Id: [0x0008559E]
You know what it reminds me of? A cathedral. An old cathedral, like you find around town.

Id: [0x0008559F]
They made me think of a science-fiction film. All sleek and moody.

Id: [0x000855A0]
Which one? Which film?

Id: [0x000855A1]
All of them!

Id: [0x000855A5]
Is it illegal when other companies call you at work and ask you to apply?

Id: [0x000855A6]
Yeah, its called head hunting. Why? Did someone call you?

Id: [0x000855A7]
Yeah, some HR guy from BLUME, the security firm in Chicago...

Id: [0x000855AE]
I'm thinking about moving there after my Visa runs out here.

Id: [0x000855AF]
You're American?.

Id: [0x000855B0]
Yeah. I have a few friends working for BLUME down there. I think that sort of thing is more up my alley. Hardware. Infrastructure. I'm just not happy here. Not really...

Id: [0x000855DB]
Ahhh. Now here some data streams are moving! That means, after entering one, your data will start moving with the stream.

Id: [0x000855DC]
And if you look closely, part of the stream is secured. And you can't move through a secured space... so hey, avoid them.

Id: [0x000855DE]
Ah, these security programs can be really nasty. They occupy the entire data stream and are constantly changing their state between active and inactive.

Id: [0x000855DF]
When they're inactive, they're harmless. But when they become active, your data will be destroyed instantly. So proceed with caution.

Id: [0x000855E3]
Back to hacking, eh? I see here you found some moving data streams. That means, after entering a one, your data will start moving with the stream.

Id: [0x000855E4]
And if you look closely, part of the stream is secured. So you can't move through that space... best to avoid the secured portion.

Id: [0x000855E6]
You're quite fond of this, aren't you? Well now you've run into a fully secured stream running the width of the node. Fortunately, the stream will constantly changing its state between active and inactive.

Id: [0x000855E7]
The point she's getting to is this: When a secured stream is inactive, it's harmless. But when one becomes active, your data will be destroyed instantly. So proceed with caution.

Id: [0x000855EA]
Ha ha! This core is a little different. Your communicator should show you information about the new programs needed to crack it.

Id: [0x000855EB]
I’m detecting some new programs. Sending you the details now.

Id: [0x000855EC]
Additional programs have been triggered, unfortunately. The information should be on your screen in a second.

Id: [0x000855ED]
Shit, they’ve put some nasty programs around that core. But the upgrades I made to your communicator should be able to figure it out.

Id: [0x000855F0]
Hello there. It seems some of these programs are a little different than those you've seen before. Your communicator should give you information about how to break through.

Id: [0x000855F1]
Ooh, it's fascinating. I’m detecting some new programs sent to befuddle you. I'll send you the details now.

Id: [0x000855F2]
Additional programs have been triggered here, so be careful. More information should be on your screen shortly. Hold on.

Id: [0x000855F3]
Dammit, they’ve installed some nasty programs around that core. But the upgrades I made to your communicator should be able to figure it out.

Id: [0x000855F5]
Ah. This is an interesting security measure. It looks like you need to find the right combination of numbers to adjust the wave.

Id: [0x000855F6]
Easy enough, right? Pick a number selector, then change its value. Once you find the right combination of numbers, you should get access.

Did Mary... did she ever tell you who it was that fathered her Child?

Id: [0x00085645]
It was a young Fella. Sailed with us on that last Voyage. [beat] Poor Lad was killed fighting beside us. The only Man not too Drunk to stand up for himself.

Id: [0x00085646]
There was so much about her I didn't know. I called her a Friend. But was I One in return?

Id: [0x00085647]
She thought the World of you, Edward. Have no Worries about that.

Id: [0x00085648]
Well, that's good to hear.

Id: [0x00085651]
Thank God you can't experience a person's death in the Animus... that'd be traumatizing.

Id: [0x00085654]
Stop that man!

Id: [0x00085655]
Oh God!

Id: [0x00085656]
You're overreacting to... to a filthy Canard! Lies and Slander meant to discredit me! The simple fact is, that Woman is my secretary. nothing more!

Id: [0x0008565B]
[FR][Criss, j'espère qu'ils croient pas que c'est moi le hacker. Faut vraiment que j'arrête de travailler aussi tard.](God, I hope they don't think I'm the hacker. I should really stop working so late.)

Id: [0x0008565D]
Wait, no, I don't want to know anything.

Id: [0x00085660]
Your colleague's computer is just to the right.

Id: [0x00085665]
What the hell are you doing? This is no time to go back to work.

Id: [0x00085667]
Aha, hey! You know you're supposed to be locked up, right? Going back upstairs ain't a good plan.

Id: [0x00085669]
Melanie is in there RIGHT NOW, you idiot. Get to the security room before she sees you.

Id: [0x0008567F]
Additionally, Aveline spent a disappointing amount of time in the Louisanna Bayou, consorting with smugglers of the lowest kind.

Id: [0x00085682]
However, as Aveline matured,  a new side emerged-- a well-manered and considerate lady of poise and compassion.

Id: [0x00085683]
Aveline came to embrace a new mentor: her stepmother, Madeleine de l'Isle, a tireless fighter for the rights of slaves.

Id: [0x0008568A]
Initial reports on Aveline de Granpré led us to believe she would be too controversial and impulsive to appeal to a wide audience. Teenaged memories show her brainwashed, and trained to kill political foes of her highly unstable Mentor, Agaté.

Id: [0x0008568C]
Our team recommends a GO on this property. Get this one to market quickly.

Id: [0x00085761]
Our researchers looked into the life of Altaïr Ibn La'Ahad, hoping to find a biography that might serve as a positive role model for Abstergo's global outreach programs. Unfortunately this renegade assassin proved to be no such thing.

Id: [0x00085763]
In much of his footage, we see a man gleefully flouting some of his culture's most entrenched taboo's with an arrogance that borders on messianic.

Id: [0x00085765]
This coupled with a wholehearted embrace of blatant superstition, paranoid delusions, and the inability to brook even the most modest dissent, and you have the makings of a true demagogue.

Id: [0x00085767]
Many of our researchers felt that the arguments articulated by Altaïr's rival - a man known as Abbas - were clearer and more cogent than any we had heard from Altaïr. I recently put in a request that more effort be dedicated to locating one of Abbas's descendants, if any exist.

Id: [0x00085769]
It's clear to us that Altair's transgressions were the primary motivation behind the ultimate dissolution of his dispicable order by the middle of the 13th century.

Id: [0x0008576B]
We therefore strongly recommend a PASS on this property, in favor of a more agreeable and inspiring figure from this era.

Id: [0x00085776]
I've heard it said our Commander calls Captain Woodes Rogers a friend as well.

Id: [0x00085777]
The man who rescued Selkirk? That Captain Rogers?

Id: [0x00085778]
Aye. A Sailor to his bones. And he's a hard man, he is. Earned a large scar down his left cheek, after taking a pellet to the face. Lodged in his palate for a couple days.

Id: [0x00085779]
By Christ! And the man lived?

Id: [0x0008577A]
Aye. Broke no stride, in fact, and continued barking orders until the next morning when he took a Splinter to the heel. That took him off his feet for a day.

Id: [0x0008577B]
And this is a living, breathing man we're talking about?

Id: [0x0008577C]
It is. He's a man of many talents and incredible charisma. I only wish he was enlisted so that I could serve under him.

Who do you mean, Captain?

I'd wager he were a Templar, but I can't rightly say, for I only met with him once. Be that as it may, his Orders are clear and strict, and his Pay is frightful good.

Id: [0x0008588F]
What's he asking?

Id: [0x00085890]
He wants that we should sail to a small Village near Yucatan, where we'll find all Manner of Heathens hopping around in Hoods and Robes. Says he'll give us a Fortune to do any kind of Damage we can.

Id: [0x00085942]
So different. The Animus, I mean. The past. At first it was confusing. Distracting. Like New Orleans. The stench. I wasn't expecting all the smells.

Id: [0x00085943]
Smell is the sense most directly linked to memory.

Id: [0x00085944]
When I'm in her memories, it's like I can smell more than I usually can.

Id: [0x00085945]
In general, women have a more acute sense of smell than men do. I had wondered how that would translate. Anything else?

Id: [0x00085946]
Yeah. She's smaller than me. But it's like her body could do more.

Id: [0x00085947]
Did that surprise you?

Id: [0x00085948]
At first, yeah. The ERA people might hate me for this, or whatever, but I don't usually think of girls that way-- climbing things. My mom. My sisters. The animal feeling of Aveline sinking her hidden blade into the throat of-- [he seems to fight a catch in his throat]

Id: [0x00085949]
Go on.

Id: [0x0008594A]
It doesn't feel... feminine. What I think of as feminine. But then at the same time it does. Her center of gravity is way lower. That was a surprise- how easy it is to land. How steady I am on her-her feet... Sorry. This is hard to talk about.

Id: [0x0008594B]
No. It's fascinating. This is what we need. Pure experience, in your own words.

Id: [0x00085957]
OK.

Id: [0x00085958]
Can you tell me about Gérald Blanc?

Id: [0x00085959]
What about him?

Id: [0x0008595A]
He and Aveline were close, but we haven't been able to ascertain if he might be your missing ancestor. Do her memories suggest anything to you?

Id: [0x0008595B]
Er...

Id: [0x0008595C]
Does this make you uncomfortable? Remember, these are HER memories. You're just playing them back. It's not even acting. You're a researcher.

Id: [0x0008595D]
Like you say, I haven't experienced her... consummating... anything. That would be... Anyway, I think maybe she was confused.

Id: [0x0008595E]
Oh?

Id: [0x0008595F]
Well, um, first of all, I don't really know for sure, OK. I mean... guys think about sex more than girls, right? That's a fact?

Id: [0x00085960]
As a researcher, what did you observe?

Id: [0x00085961]
Does it mean she's more... like a guy... if she thinks about... Is that why she's able to assassinate-- well OK, here's the thing. I don't know her thoughts. But from what's in her memories, physically-- the fidgeting. Some hesitation. What she looked at. Who she looked away from. The things she didn't say when I expected her to... If I had to GUESS what it meant, I would think she was thinking about... sex. But I'm a guy so I would think that, right? So what does it mean for women to act that way? It has to mean something else, right?

Id: [0x00085962]
As a subject, you're able to observe more finely than I am in review.

Id: [0x00085963]
[Pain Grunt]

Id: [0x00085965]
What about unwanted attention from men?

Id: [0x00085967]
I thought that would be the hardest to deal with. I am NOT into that, for the record. Not at all.

Id: [0x00085968]
Yes, I know.

Id: [0x00085969]
But the way she dealt with it-- it happened so often, it's like you stop noticing everything she does to avoid it. Crossing the street. Eyes in the back of her head. She knew how to handle herself. When she was "charming" it felt kind of similar to... killing. Or the build-up to killing. I-- Can we take a break, Mr. Vidic?

Id: [0x0008596B]
Of course.

February 12, 1981. Qualitative Personal Interview with Subject One, on ancestral research regarding Aveline de Grand Pré.

Id: [0x00085973]
Ready to go on?

Id: [0x00085974]
Yes.

Id: [0x00085975]
Aveline was black.

Id: [0x00085976]
And white. On her father's side.

Id: [0x00085977]
You're sensitive to that.

Id: [0x00085978]
I guess. I mean, I'm white. Aveline looks black, so that's different. But you get used to it, like with the girl thing. Until someone makes you not used to it.

Id: [0x00085979]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0008597A]
I don't think I've ever had to think so much about what I'm wearing, or how I'm walking. But Aveline, it's like, she goes through her whole life in these... uniforms.

Id: [0x0008597B]
People expect her to behave in a certain way.

Id: [0x0008597C]
Definitely. Sometimes I worry I'll slip up and play it too relaxed at the warehouse, and, I don't know... Blow her cover.

Id: [0x0008597D]
You can't blow her cover.

Id: [0x0008597E]
I know, I know, I'm just replaying the memories. I can't change them. I know. But I see it, right? It's a risk. It's...

Id: [0x0008597F]
Stressful?

Id: [0x00085980]
Yes. It's best when she goes out as an Assassin. On the roofs or in the Bayou. I think she was more relaxed that way? Can you imagine? You're only relaxed when you're going to go kill someone?

Id: [0x00085981]
Let's stick to memories rather than imagination.

Id: [0x00085982]
What about the slaves?

Id: [0x00085983]
They're kind of just... everywhere. That sounds bad. Slavery is bad. But no one is acting like slavery is bad. It's fun when she frees slaves. Is it supposed to be fun?

Id: [0x00085984]
We're not looking for "supposed to." Focus on what it is.

Id: [0x00085985]
[Sigh.] Everything about this is hard to talk about.

Id: [0x0008599E]
How are you feeling? Any side effects?

Id: [0x000859F7]
[Laugh intro...] Hey,[laugh] You clever little hacker, you found me! Well, congratu-fuckinglations. I suppose you expect some sort of reward now. Some sort of validation for having more free time than the rest of us. And now its only a matter of time before you post this somewhere on the internet for all your little followers to hear, and you'll sit back and revel in their faint, slobbering praise while enjoying your fifteen megabytes of fame, and then... and then... what exactly? Uh?[beat] Nothing. Nothing at all. Because your life hasn't changed. And you're still a disgusting human. And you're going to die... eventually. And on your deathbed, you'll remember this message and think to yourself... by God, John was right... I should have been an astronaut. And you know what? You'll be right. You should have been an astronaut. For there's nothing worth seeing or saving down here. But out there... Oh... So much possibility. Oh well... I hope it's painless.

Are you ready? He's waiting for us.

Id: [0x00086878]
Up to the penthouse! Yeah?

Id: [0x00086899]
Hey. You ready?

Id: [0x0008689A]
Over here. Olivier's waiting on us.

Id: [0x0008689B]
If you need to use the toilet first, make it snappy.

Id: [0x0008689C]
Good to go?

Id: [0x000868A9]
It should be easy to find.

Id: [0x000868AC]
There you go. See there?

Id: [0x000868AF]
Olivier's a nice guy. He won't bite.

Id: [0x000868B6]
Over here!

Id: [0x000868B7]

Id: [0x000868CC]
Go on, try it out.

Id: [0x000868CD]
Are you having trouble with your communicator?

Id: [0x000868E9]

It's a hundred Leagues or more to Havana. Will you walk that Distance?

Id: [0x00086B90]
Posh Git. Where's he running to?

Id: [0x00086B92]
You're Feeling a bit queasy are you? Settle down and let me have a Look!

Id: [0x00086BA9]
Lend us a few Reales then. I did save your Skin.

Id: [0x00086BAA]
Ah, uh... of course!

Id: [0x00086BAB]
Cheers.

Id: [0x00086BAF]

Id: [0x00086BB0]
You give as good as you get!

Id: [0x00086BB1]
I can block as good as you, Mate.

Id: [0x00086BB9]
[SP][Buenos Dias, Señores.](Hello Sirs.) You're late.

Id: [0x00086BBB]
Yes, sir.[Sí] (Yes). We are very sorry. Our Captain delayed us.

Id: [0x00086BBE]
This would be Captain Mendoza?

Id: [0x00086BBF]
Yes, Sir. He is very excited to meet you. Only he must be present for a... a... a Hanging, [SP][Señor.](Sir.)

Id: [0x00086BC0]
Hanging? Ah... love a good Hanging!

Id: [0x00086BC1]
Yes Sir. Very nice. If we hear the Bell, we may go... if you like!

Id: [0x00086BC2]
I'd love too. Especially, if Captain Mendoza is pulling the Trap. The man owes me Money for the Slaves I sold him.

Id: [0x00086BC3]
Of course, Sir. Captain Mendoza is happy to pay you. We have Goods to sell. Sugars and such.

Id: [0x00086BC4]
Excellent.

Id: [0x00086BC8]
Your Friend doesn't say much, does he?

Id: [0x00086BC9]
Ah...

Id: [0x00086BCB]
The Bell, Señor! The Hanging will be started soon!

Id: [0x00086BCC]
Well, let's not dilly-dally!

Id: [0x00086BCD]
Yes Sir. We go!

Id: [0x00086BCF]
This way! This way.

Id: [0x00086BD0]
We are close!

Id: [0x00086BD1]
Almost there!

Id: [0x00086BD3]
Oh his English, very bad. Very, very bad.

Id: [0x00086C50]
How long will this Hanging take, Man? I don't mean to hang about all Day for the Captain.

Id: [0x00086C51]
Quick as anything, Sir. Captain Mendoza needs only to hang the Man, then he will deliver your Payment.

Id: [0x00086C52]
I don't want Reales, mind. I want Goods. Things I can sell. Tobacco. Rum. Sugar.

Id: [0x00086C53]
[SP][Sí, Sí!](Yes, Yes!) We have much fine Sugar. Crates we took off a fat Englishman last Night.

Id: [0x00086C54]
Englishman?

Id: [0x00086C55]
[SP][Sí](Yes), Sugar from Barbados. Very fine. We hold it in the Castillo after the man started the fight last night. He ran, left his Sugar behind. Very fine.

Id: [0x00086C56]
Well that's a start. Shall I accompany him to the Castillo?

Id: [0x00086C57]
No Sir. Captain Mendoza will have it sent you, I believe. You will see.

Id: [0x00086C58]
Good lord! Is that big Brute your Captain Mendoza?

Id: [0x00086C59]
No sir. He is El Tiburón. El Tiburón, Governor Torres's Man.

Id: [0x00086C62]
I reckon that Room'll be locked. So where's the Key?

Id: [0x00086C63]
Found a Key. Let's see if it works.

Id: [0x00086C64]
Here's my goods. Time to tell Bonnet the bad News.

Id: [0x00086C7D]
We've got no round Shot, Captain! Nothing to shoot with!

Id: [0x00086C7E]
Crew says there's no Shot for them Cannons.

Id: [0x00086C7F]
Here's some Powder kegs. It's all we got!

Id: [0x00086C80]
In a Pinch, we can light them Barrels and toss 'em backwards. But that's all the Firepower we got.

Id: [0x00086C85]
They're dropping Powder Kegs, Kenway! Order your men to fire on 'em with the Swivels before they cause you any Trouble.

Id: [0x00086C86]
Take your Time with aiming, Lads... and unload at the right Moment!

Id: [0x00086C90]
The Mentor bids us be ready for anything. The Templars may know our Whereabouts now.

Id: [0x00086C91]
It was Walpole, isn't that right? The Englishman?

Id: [0x00086C92]
Aye. He played us from the Start... betrayed our Confidence.

Id: [0x00086C93]
How could we have known? Even Ah Tabai was taken in by his Charms.

Id: [0x00086C94]
I saw a ship pass this way. Close upon the Shore, then gone.

Id: [0x00086C95]
Ah Tabai warned us to be vigilant. The Templars have been closing in for well on a year now.

Id: [0x00086C96]
Indeed. But Templars make Noise with their comings and goings. I've not heard a thing just yet.

Id: [0x00086C97]
You will.

Id: [0x00086CA0]
What's our Course today, Captain? It's a fine Day for any kind of Mischief.

Id: [0x00086CA1]
What's your Feeling?

Id: [0x00086CA2]
I'll make no Secret of wanting to see the British brought to Heel. If we can take their Gold and put it to use ourselves, I'd be a happy Man.

Id: [0x00086CA3]
Spoken like a true Welshman, Adé.

Id: [0x00086CA4]
[laughs]And what's your Aim?

Id: [0x00086CA5]
Master Kidd hinted at a Prize he was eager to show me down in Tulum. Quite some distance, mind. On the Yucatan Peninsula.

Id: [0x00086CA6]
You trust him to play it fair?

Id: [0x00086CA7]
I can't be sure. But he has a way of picking away at my Conscience that gives me Pause. I should go see him. Soon.

Id: [0x00086CA8]
So long as we take some Prizes along the way, I'm sure the Crew will understand. I'll set a course for Tulum.

Id: [0x00086CAB]
The door's Mechanism seems to be broke. Let's find another Way 'round.

Id: [0x00086CAC]
Follow on, man!

Id: [0x00086CAD]
Jump!

Id: [0x00086CB0]
[A sputtering shiver as he emerges from cold water.]

Id: [0x00086CB4]
That's it!

Id: [0x00086CB5]
That's a Match.

Id: [0x00086CB6]
Doesn't seem like the right Match.

Id: [0x00086CB7]
That doesn't seem right.

Id: [0x00086CB8]
Hm... those don't Match.

Id: [0x00086CB9]
This isn't working. Try Something else.

Id: [0x00086CBA]
Not sure that belongs there...

Id: [0x00086CBC]
Shall we climb these Stones here? Seems like they might move.

Id: [0x00086CBD]
Clamber up those Stones, Kenway. I've an Idea.

Id: [0x00086CBE]
Might be those Stones are Counterweights.

Id: [0x00086CBF]
I reckon this Puzzle works like the last few.

Id: [0x00086CC3]
Is it out of Kindness you do this, or Guilt?

Id: [0x00086CC4]
It was a Slaver who brought these Soldiers. Laurens Prins himself.

Id: [0x00086CC5]
I may thank you later, if you manage to live through this.

Id: [0x00086CC6]
Many Thanks, but no Forgiveness.

Id: [0x00086CC9]
Are the Stories about you true, sir? You were a Governor in Florida for a Time?

Id: [0x00086CCA]
[SP][Sí, sí](Yes, Yes) I am one of a Number of civil Servants in my Family. A long line of Politicians.

Id: [0x00086CCB]
I have always toyed with the Idea of entering Politics myself, only I feel I have too much Money and not enough Years.

Id: [0x00086CCC]
Speaking of Stories, Prins... I've heard it said you were with Henry Morgan the Day he sacked Panama. Sixteen-seventy-one, was it?

Id: [0x00086CCD]
O, it's all true, yes. But let us not over-esteem the Honours forged and won on the Battlefield. That Skirmish was a deadly One, and a tremendous Waste of Coin and Resources.

Id: [0x00086CCE]
It wasn't until many Years after that I sheathed my Sword in favor of a far safer and yet more profitable Venture. Capital and Resources. That's where Money is made. And, Sir, let me tell you... Honour bought is more enjoyable than Honour won, if a Touch less permanent.

Id: [0x00086CD2]
Stand your Ground, Slave! And face corporal Punishment like a Man.

Id: [0x00086CD3]
Why act like a Man now when you have denied me that Right for thirty YEARS!

Id: [0x00086CD4]
Fire on the Bastards!

Id: [0x00086CD5]
You... you say you came alone, Torres?

Id: [0x00086CD6]
Not alone, but certainly without Colleagues. I took Passage aboard a British Merchant's Brig.

Id: [0x00086CD7]
Ah...

Id: [0x00086CDD]
Guards! Guards! To me!

Id: [0x00086CDE]
Intruder! Ring the bell!

Id: [0x00086CDF]

Id: [0x00086CE3]
Aim...

Id: [0x00086CE4]
Fire!

Id: [0x00086CEC]
Eh, eh eh! God the Kill Devil's something ferocious this Year!

Id: [0x00086CEF]
Help us out now, and we'll help you. My Sister here's poorly, can't you see?

Id: [0x00086CF1]
[Vomiting sound]

Id: [0x00086CF3]
Do me a Favor, Darling!

Id: [0x00086CF4]
Not without a Glint of Silver, I won't!

Id: [0x00086CF5]
Come on, Love! I'm burning.

Id: [0x00086CF6]
Ach! Burning with a Dose! Get you gone!

Id: [0x00086CF8]
Would you lend us a Silver Crown, Sir? Or a couple o' Reales if you've Heart enough?

Id: [0x00086CFC]
It’s your Turn at the Oars.

Id: [0x00086CFD]
The Devil it is. I rowed last time.

Id: [0x00086CFE]
Aye, and wagered your next Turn on a poor Hand of Cards, as I recall.

Id: [0x00086CFF]
Blast! So I did. [Loud sigh]

Id: [0x00086D01]
Come on then. The Captain’s waiting.

Id: [0x00086D04]
The Fireship's gone off her Heading, Captain. Follow her close on!

Id: [0x00086D05]
Follow the Fire Ship!

Id: [0x00086D09]
Tell me about Edward Teach. What sort of man is he?

Id: [0x00086D0A]
It's Thatch, Sir. Least, that's what he calls himself. But he's a mad Bugger, he is. Cracked as a glass Teapot, Sir.

Id: [0x00086D0B]
Details man! Stop talking in gibberish.

Id: [0x00086D0C]
Well sir, he likes his Drink for Instance. Only he makes 'em queer. Takes the usual Rum Flip, and fills it with half a Weight of Gunpowder to top it off.

Id: [0x00086D0D]
Did I hear you aright? He DRINKS Gunpowder?

Id: [0x00086D0E]
Aye, Sir. Just for Show.

Id: [0x00086D0F]
And only last Week he rounded up a Score of his Crew and bade us sit in the Hold of his Ship while he burnt off Sulfur and other sickening Minerals. We just sat there like it was one of a million pits of Hell, and nothing less ordinary.

Id: [0x00086D10]
Good GOD. What the Hell for?

Id: [0x00086D11]
Liked to test his Crew is all. Tease out their Fitness and what. 'Course it always turned out he was the fittest of the Lot.

Id: [0x00086D14]
She’s spooked, Captain! The Slaver’s Ship is running!

Id: [0x00086D15]
Damned Fool! I’ll get us in close!

Id: [0x00086D18]
Up ahead! They're unloading something from that Ship!

Id: [0x00086D19]
Could that be our Prize?

Id: [0x00086D1C]
I can bring the Jackdaw closer, but those lookouts will be a Problem.

Id: [0x00086D1D]
Well spotted. I'll clear them off first

Id: [0x00086D22]
Under Attack once more. Come.

Id: [0x00086D23]
To the Beach!

Id: [0x00086D24]
Stay close, Edward. Follow my Lead.

Id: [0x00086D25]
So many dead... so many injured!

Id: [0x00086D26]
Edward! Find the Man who led this Attack. Finish him off!

Id: [0x00086D27]
That Coward is hiding aboard his Ship.

Id: [0x00086D28]
Good to see you here, Breddah!

Many men's afraid of Kenway. "Devil," they call him. But I got one thing he don't have: this fort.

Id: [0x00086D86]
I'd love to see the "devil" try to get past my men. He won't, of course, but if he did, oh I'd show him hell.

I bet you would.

Tell it to the sea. I'm sick of your boasting and speaking in tongues.

Id: [0x00086D8B]
You'll regret saying that when you're face to face with the monster of the North!

Id: [0x00086D8C]
It'll swallow you, and your ship with it, and any whales that happen to be nearby at the time.

Id: [0x00086F85]
Here!

Id: [0x00086F86]
THATCH![EFFORT]

Id: [0x00086FB3]
I was born into slavery.

Id: [0x00086FB4]
Deprived of any right. Of any faith.

Id: [0x00086FB5]
I was sold. Traded for labour.

Id: [0x00086FB6]
Forced to watch the suffering. Treated like a beast of burden.

Id: [0x00086FB7]
With no future ahead of me, I forged my own.

Id: [0x00086FB8]
And I knew blood would be the price.

Id: [0x00086FB9]
At sea, I found my Brothers among pirates and Assassins.

Id: [0x00086FBA]
I never looked back. Never wanted to, Never had to. Until now.

Id: [0x00086FBE]
[Happy cheer]

Id: [0x00086FBF]
[Disappointed sigh]

Id: [0x009897E5]
Not Bad Thatch! But my throw be closer.

Id: [0x009897E6]
All right lad, But I be taking these two anyway.

Id: [0x009897E7]
Ah, bloody pirate... Alright Thatch, you enjoy yourself there. I'll be right back.

Id: [0x009897EB]
Goddamn Lobsters! They won't quit!

Id: [0x009897EC]
It's your Trick at the Helm, Kenway. I'll bark the Orders.

Id: [0x009897EF]

Id: [0x009897FC]
Bring it to them, Lads!!

Id: [0x009897FE]
She's Breached! Keep at her!

Id: [0x00989800]
Her mizzen's cracked! All hands to the Rails.

Id: [0x00989801]
Put your Hooks in her!

Id: [0x00989802]
Reeve off and hop the Rails! Let's send these Puppies to the Devil!

Id: [0x00989804]
Are we spitting poppy Seeds? Load the heavy shot!

Id: [0x00989805]
They're you go! That Shot'll sink'em!

Id: [0x0098980B]

Id: [0x0098980C]
Bury the Lot, Boys. Take no Guff!

Id: [0x0098980D]
I'll cleave ye lengthwise, Maggots!

Id: [0x0098980E]
How you be doing, Edward m'lad?

Id: [0x0098980F]
I'll not fall here, today Bastards. Come at me!

Id: [0x00989810]
Can you fight free, lad? Can ye make it clear?

Id: [0x00989811]
Here's the Path to Perdition!

Id: [0x00989876]
Captain Blackbeard brings too much Attention on himself. Perhaps it isn't wise to be drawn into his Madness.

Id: [0x00989877]
There's Method in it. And the Seas would be poorer without him.

Id: [0x0098987A]
Careful, Captain. We're drifting close to a Watchtower.

Id: [0x0098987B]
Them Watchtower's might spot us. Best keep out of Sight.

Id: [0x0098987C]
There's another Watchtower, sir.

Id: [0x00989882]
Careful with the Banks.

Id: [0x00989883]
Let us hope the river remains this wide.

Id: [0x00989884]
Be sure they don't spy us trailing them.

Id: [0x00989885]
Steady does it, captain.

Id: [0x00989886]
I see them. Over there.

Id: [0x00989887]
If we run aground here we may never get out.

Id: [0x0098988A]
All stop.

Id: [0x0098988B]
There's always another Way.

Id: [0x00989894]
We're nearing that Wreck. Gives me the Willies.

Id: [0x00989895]
Is there anything that don't give you the Willies?

Id: [0x00989896]
Well, she's like everything else in this bloody Swamp. Dead and waiting.

Id: [0x00989897]
You keep rowing like that and we'll be waiting right beside her.

Id: [0x0098989A]
You think it's true what they say about Blackbeard? That fire strikes out from his head? As if from some volcano?

Id: [0x0098989D]
If he's not the Devil himself, then surely he's made some Pact with Hell. Only be thankful his Ship remains anchored, and hasn't torn a Path into the Heart of Charles-Towne.

Id: [0x0098989E]
Bloody Pirates. Someone ought to do something.

Id: [0x0098989F]
They'll be hunted down eventually. Every last one of them.

Id: [0x009898A3]
What was that?! It was a Crocodile, wasn't it? It's coming straight for us, I can feel it.

Id: [0x009898A4]
You know the legends about this swamp, don't you?

Id: [0x009898A6]
What?

Id: [0x009898A7]
The first slave owners who settled here were a rough, callous bunch. Anyone who showed the least backbone was brought here and fed to the lizards. Now their spirits haunt the bayou, tricking fellows into the maws of the beasts, their tortured souls set upon revenge.

Id: [0x009898AA]
Bloody hell, Ryder. Next time keep your legends to yourself.

Id: [0x009898AE]
This Blockade best end soon. I'm going land-crazy, and this dirty Puddle won't do.

Id: [0x009898AF]
One would suppose all this was for gold. Or Rum at least.

Id: [0x009898B0]
Nothing but Medicines to cure whatever ailments fester aboard their vessels.

Id: [0x009898B1]
Syphilis and scurvy no doubt. What noxious coffins those pirate ships must be.

Id: [0x009898B4]
If Heat or the Reptiles don't finish us, it'll be these damnable Insects.

Id: [0x009898B5]
Aye, the Mosquitoes'll sup every last ounce of Vitality from us.

Id: [0x009898B6]
That'd be a nicer End than suffocating in some bloody Miasma. Ever seen a man consumed by the yellow Fever?

Id: [0x009898B7]
[coughs] You know, I haven't been feel all too well these past few days...

Id: [0x009898BA]
Almost there.

Id: [0x009898BB]
Good. Captain Wyatt is not a patient man.

Id: [0x009898BC]
Patient enough to wait for Blackbeard to tire, it seems.

Id: [0x009898BD]
He has his mind set on becoming governor himself one day. Likely sees this as a chance to prove his worth.

Id: [0x009898BE]
Gambling with the lives of them that's been taken hostage? Isn't councilman Wraggs among their number?

Id: [0x009898BF]
There's little love betwixt those who share power. Particularly when one seeks to rise among his peers. Now steady those oars and make haste. The captain is not above making an example of a tardy soldier.

Id: [0x009898C3]
This Heat saps one's Will to live at Times.

Id: [0x009898C4]
Damn Mosquitoes!

Id: [0x009898C5]
It's Moments like these I miss England the most.

Id: [0x009898C6]
Stop your fidgeting, Thomas. There's nothing in those Shadows to startle a grown Man.

Id: [0x009898C7]
Did you hear that?! There's Things out there...

Id: [0x009898C8]
I saw a Shadow in the water!

Id: [0x009898C9]
It's a balmy Night, and no Mistake.

Id: [0x009898CB]
Private Ryder reporting, sir.

Id: [0x009898CC]
And doing so with great Delay.

Id: [0x009898CD]
No change, sir. They're holding fast but are yet to kill or maim any of the Captives, near as we can tell. Perhaps it's time to--

Id: [0x009898CE]
To surrender? I've been entrusted with the Affairs of this Town, and I do not intend to bow to the demands of a Pirate, no matter how fierce his Reputation.

Id: [0x009898CF]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x009898D0]
As long as the supply Key is with me, no Man shall touch that Medicine. May Plague and Calamity strike them all.

Id: [0x009898D4]
Someone's after the captain!

Id: [0x009898D5]
What's going on?!

Id: [0x009898D6]
Hey! Stop!

Id: [0x009898D7]
There's an intruder! Get 'im!

Id: [0x009898D8]
Do something!

Id: [0x009898D9]
He's going for the captain!

Id: [0x009899B6]
Who goes there?!

Id: [0x009899B7]
Calm down, Clark, it's only us.

Id: [0x009899BB]
Identify yourself!

Id: [0x009899BC]
Privates Ryder and Thomas.

Id: [0x009899C0]
What's that? Someone there?

Id: [0x009899C1]
It's us. We're reporting to the Captain.

Id: [0x009899D4]
That's when I grabbed him by the throat and stuck a blade in his gullet.

Id: [0x009899D5]
Whoreson had it coming. Still, I'd have slashed him through the mouth. Show everyone what happens when ya don't hold yer tongue.

Id: [0x009899D6]
It did the trick. Not a peep from one of 'em all the way to port.

Id: [0x009899D8]
Sea turned crimson in a flash. Seven of us thrashing for dear life, and the sharks all a-feasting.

Id: [0x009899D9]
How'd ya get out of it?

Id: [0x009899DA]
I grabs me a-hold of the first mate on one side and a swabby on the other, and lets the sharks have their fill while I swim for shore.

Id: [0x009899DB]
Bah! Yer full of it, yer lying bastard.

Id: [0x009899DC]
[laughs in an unsettling way]<CR>

Id: [0x009899DE]
Gonna try escaping again, you mongrel?

Id: [0x009899DF]
No, sir. No escape. No escape. Please.

Id: [0x009899E0]
Oughta slice off yer fucking hands and feet, see how far you get.

Id: [0x009899E1]
Please, sir, no! No!

Id: [0x009899E2]
But then you wouldn't fetch much of a price, would ya? Just remember, there's other parts no one that buys ya will miss. [laughs]

Id: [0x009899E4]
Please, sir, please.

Id: [0x009899E5]
You are here to help us, yes?

Id: [0x009899E6]
We beg you.

Id: [0x009899E7]
Do not leave us here, please. Do not leave us.

Id: [0x009899E9]
Thank you! Thank you!

Id: [0x009899EA]
You have saved my life.

Id: [0x009899EB]
You are good man. Good man.

Id: [0x009899EC]
Bless you, sir.

Id: [0x009899EE]
Alright, lads. The Medusa'll be here on the morrow to fetch these heathens to market.

Id: [0x009899EF]
No beatings, and keep them fed and watered. We don't want to lose any more.

Id: [0x009899F0]
Once we have the coin in our pocket, we sail to shore for whores and rum!

Id: [0x00989A47]
[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x00989A48]
Hello?

Id: [0x00989A49]
Lads? Lieutenant? You out here?

Id: [0x00989A4A]
Jenkins. Not followed, were you?

Id: [0x00989A4C]
Don't think so. Kenway suspects something though. He doesn't miss much.

Id: [0x00989A51]
What about our man?

Id: [0x00989A52]
They've been pressing him hard all night, but he hasn't broken yet.

Id: [0x00989A55]
What was that?

Id: [0x00989A57]
You certain you didn't bring some of those sand rats in tow, Jenkins?

Id: [0x00989A59]
Look sharp. Stevens, make certain there are no surprises by the temple.

Id: [0x00989A6A]
Quickly, send the signal. And remember always this day.

Id: [0x00989A72]
Who's that there? In the water?

Id: [0x00989A73]
Two old 'gators come for their Supper.

Id: [0x00989A74]
Ryder, me old mucker. Bit warm tonight, ain't it?

Id: [0x00989A75]
We'll talk about the weather another time, mate. Bit of a hurry.

Id: [0x00989A76]
Right-oh.

Id: [0x00989A79]
You seen any crocodiles tonight? I could've sworn I saw something pass the boat.

Id: [0x00989A7A]
Nope, quiet night.

Id: [0x00989A7B]
Are you sure? I heard something in the water.

Id: [0x00989A7C]
Quiet 'til you showed up. Go on then. Captain's waiting.

Id: [0x00989A81]
Hullo! That Ryder yonder?

Id: [0x00989A82]
The very same.

Id: [0x00989A83]
Then speed along. You're expected. And you know how-- [screams]

Id: [0x00989A85]
Oh Christ!

Id: [0x00989A86]
It took him! It took him! I told you!

Id: [0x00989A87]
Just row, for godsakes! Row!

Id: [0x00989A89]
Bloody hell!

Id: [0x00989A8A]
Simon! Simon! He's gone!

Id: [0x00989A8C]
I told you there was something! Didn't I tell you? Oh god...

Id: [0x00989A8D]
Let's just get out of here.

Id: [0x00989A8F]
Can't you make this thing go any faster?

Id: [0x00989A90]
Is it after us? Can you see it?

Id: [0x00989A91]
Don't think about it. Just row. Row!

Id: [0x00989A95]
Bloody hell, I'm suffocating here. I wasn't made for this Climate.

Id: [0x00989A96]
It's good practice. We'll all end up in the fires of damnation one day.

Id: [0x00989A97]
Speak for yourself. I have my deathbed confession all ready.

Id: [0x00989A99]
I hope they give Blackbeard whatever he wants.

Id: [0x00989A9A]
Didn't know you had such sympathy for pirates.

Id: [0x00989A9B]
Sympathy for my own neck, more like. I say, give him his prize and let him be on his merry way.

Id: [0x00989A9C]
You're a credit to the British army.

Id: [0x00989A9D]
I apologize, sir. There was an Accident. Private Simon-- this Crocodile, it was huge, it--

Id: [0x00989A9E]
I don't care about your Accidents. What's the Word from the Harbor, Soldier? Speak!

Id: [0x00989A9F]
What?!

Id: [0x00989AA0]
Intruder! Help!

Id: [0x00989B01]
I see a Rowboat, Captain. Is it them?

Id: [0x00989B03]
I believe it is. If my Information is correct, they should lead us right to whoever is in charge of this godammed Mess.

Id: [0x00989B05]
How do we know they will lead us to the Medicine?

Id: [0x00989B06]
Because Providence commands it. Besides, I heard it's under the protection of a British Captain, and that's who these errand Boys are reporting to.

Id: [0x00989B08]
Keep her at half-sail, Captain. Speed'll do us no Favors in these Waters.

Id: [0x00989B0A]
Slow down, Captain. Let them pass by.

Id: [0x00989B0F]
Where the hell is Kenway? He's missing a sweet morsel!

Id: [0x00989B10]
Note the day, lads! Today we send the King's finest to their graves!

Id: [0x00989B11]
Aye, sir.

Id: [0x00989B12]
Secure the other side and watch the path.

Id: [0x00989B13]
Aye.

Id: [0x00989B17]
Nothing here. Why is it always me sent into dread and shadow?

Id: [0x00989B19]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x00989B30]
We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B32]
[Laughs]It's not the first time, Kenway. And it won't be the last.

Id: [0x00989B35]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B3E]
We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B40]
[Laughs] That just makes it a fair fight.

Id: [0x00989B43]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B4C]
We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B4E]
[Laughs]Wouldn't want it any other way.

Id: [0x00989B51]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B5B]
How do you like our chances, mate?

Id: [0x00989B5D]
[Laughs]I'd say they find themselves outnumbered.

Id: [0x00989B60]
Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B67]
Stop him!

Id: [0x00989B68]
Do something, you fools!

Id: [0x00989B69]
Somebody shoot him!

Id: [0x00989B6A]
Help!

Id: [0x00989B6B]
Kill him! Kill him!

Id: [0x00989B6C]
Carry on!

Id: [0x00989B6F]
What was that?

Id: [0x00989B70]
I don't know, but let's not find out.

Id: [0x00989B72]
Did you hear that Noise?

Id: [0x00989B73]
It's just the Trees creaking.

Id: [0x00989B74]
Or Something making them creek...

Id: [0x00989B77]
We cannot pass them undetected, Captain. And there is no other Way.

Id: [0x00989B7A]
They're getting away, Captain.

Id: [0x00989B7C]
What was that? Did you hear it?

Id: [0x00989B7D]
Huh?! What the devil was that?

Id: [0x00989B7E]
There are some mighty strange Noises in this Swamp.

Id: [0x00989B80]
Bloody Idiot.

Id: [0x00989B83]
I'm trying! I'm trying!

Id: [0x00989B86]
I don't want to die here!

Id: [0x00989B87]
We'll be there any second now. Don't worry.

Id: [0x00989B8A]
Close the Gate!

Id: [0x00989B8C]
What the hell?!

Id: [0x00989B8D]
Hey!

Id: [0x00989B8E]
[Startled shout]

Id: [0x00989B90]
Thank Christ! I thought we'd never make it.

Id: [0x00989B93]
Ryder! I was starting to think you'd got lost.

Id: [0x00989B94]
No such Luck, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B95]
Well, keep a Watch for Crocodiles up ahead. Swamp's full of the Buggers.

Id: [0x00989B96]
What? Does he jest?

Id: [0x00989B99]
I'll be back with the Medicines.

Id: [0x00989B9A]
Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989BA3]
Ready the Whaleboat, lads.

Id: [0x00989BA4]
Unlash the Harpoons.

Id: [0x00989BA5]
Let's hunt, Lads.

Id: [0x00989BA9]
There he is!

Id: [0x00989BAA]
I see him!

Id: [0x00989BAB]
There's our Prey.

Id: [0x00989BAC]
He's over there!

Id: [0x00989BAD]
There he goes.

Id: [0x00989BAE]
It's there!

Id: [0x00989BAF]
Ready, lads.

Id: [0x00989BB0]
Let's get started.

Id: [0x00989BB4]
Damn!

Id: [0x00989BB5]
Let's get back to the Ship, lads.

Id: [0x00989BB9]
We'll get him next time, Captain.

Id: [0x00989BBA]
We'll catch him some other Day, Sir.

Id: [0x00989BBB]
He won't get away next Time.

Id: [0x00989BBE]
Hey! Oh, oh! My friend! Hey, I like that too! He, he! We have got it. Hey!

Id: [0x00989BC0]
Hoist him up!

Id: [0x00989BC2]
They caught a hammer!

Id: [0x00989BC4]
He's a monster!

Id: [0x00989BC6]
Look at the size of him!

Id: [0x00989BC8]
Whale ho!

Id: [0x00989BCA]
It's the White Whale!

Id: [0x00989BCD]
A Great Catch, Captain!

Id: [0x00989BCE]
A fine Haul today, Sir.

Id: [0x00989BCF]
Well done, Captain.

Id: [0x00989BDB]
We should avoid those patrol boats, captain.

Id: [0x00989BDC]
Patrol boat, sir. We should plot a new course.

Id: [0x00989BDD]
Another boat. Let's stay out of their way.

Id: [0x00989BE7]
Ready...

Id: [0x00989BE8]
Fire!

Id: [0x00989BE9]
Take Aim... Fire!

Id: [0x00989BEB]
Steady your Aim, Man!

Id: [0x00989BEC]
Thank your Stars these Targets don't shoot back.

Id: [0x00989BED]
Grant, you Fool! Try opening your bloody Eyes!

Id: [0x00989BEE]
Stand strong! Don't let the Rifle push you around.

Id: [0x00989BEF]
Miss a Shot out there and you'll be worm Meat. Think on that!

Id: [0x00989BF3]
Don't drop it now! It's worth more than your Life.

Id: [0x00989BF4]
Move it, Lads!

Id: [0x00989BF5]
Faster! Come on! We don't have all Day.

Id: [0x00989BF6]
Put your Back into it, you Ninnies!

Id: [0x00989BF7]
Steady with that one, Jones. You'll blow us all up!

Id: [0x00989BFB]
Never conceived I'd end up in a Place like this. I set off from Dublin a young Lad, ready to die for my family.

Id: [0x00989BFC]
I'd rather die for Silver.  He makes for a grander Funeral.

Id: [0x00989C00]
You been smoking again? You'll blow us all skyward, you daft Bugger.

Id: [0x00989C01]
Ah... Keep yer Breeches on, Gravesy. I know my Way around Gunpowder. Been handling it all my Life, haven't I?

Id: [0x00989C02]
Aye, well maybe it's blighted your Senses. I've seen better Men than you set off a Barrel. One Flicker of scorched Tobacco and you're nought but Jetsam.

Id: [0x00989C08]
I'm gonna pull that Tongue right out of your Skull!

Id: [0x00989C09]
You and how many Whoresons?

Id: [0x00989C0A]
Come here, Swine! I demand an Apology!

Id: [0x00989C0B]
And I'll ask your Mother for one!

Id: [0x00989C0C]
Leave my Mother out of this or I swear I'll kill you twice-over.

Id: [0x00989C0D]
Oh yeah?

Id: [0x00989C0E]
Yeah!

Id: [0x00989C11]
I say we sneak in just before Dawn, same as last time, stash away as much Rum as we can while the Captain's snoring off another Skinful.

Id: [0x00989C12]
Bastard's downed half our Hoard already. There'll be nothing left to take back Home.

Id: [0x00989C13]
Then we'll find some more. The whole Ocean's carrying Rum. And I aim to get my Share.

Id: [0x00989C14]
Just before Dawn then. If we don't die of Thirst beforehand.

Id: [0x00989C18]
Pissing away my Life in this bloody Cave. As if anyone's going to find us.

Id: [0x00989C19]
Walk back and forth, back and forth, staring at these damned Walls.

Id: [0x00989C1A]
Oh look, nobody there. Again. What a Surprise. Wish someone did appear. Put me out of my Misery.

Id: [0x00989C1E]
They must have left in one Hell of a Hurry. Look at all this.

Id: [0x00989C1F]
The cowards probably saw a Ship approach and fled. Can't be much of any worth left... When none that ain't touched by a Rot.

Id: [0x00989C20]
Don't be so sure, Mate. Alfred just came across three Barrels of fine Rum.

Id: [0x00989C21]
I think we just found a new Home.

Id: [0x00989C24]
Oy! Can anyone hear me? Hello?

Id: [0x00989C25]
This Place is a bloody Death Trap. I can't get out.

Id: [0x00989C26]
Hello? Come on! Get me out of here!

Id: [0x00989C29]
Shit. Another rotten one. Nothing.

Id: [0x00989C2A]
Keep searching! We don't want to leave anything valuable behind.

Id: [0x00989C2B]
And watch out for Gunpowder when you go poking around.

Id: [0x00989C2E]
What you think happened here?

Id: [0x00989C2F]
I don't know, but it's been abandoned for some time. They're not coming back.

Id: [0x00989C30]
Maybe they didn't want to. Maybe this Place is, you know...

Id: [0x00989C31]
What?

Id: [0x00989C32]
Haunted.

Id: [0x00989C33]
[Snorts derisively] It's famished Rats you have to fear, not Ghosts.

Id: [0x00989C34]
I don't know. I can feel their Presence. Like they're watching us.

Id: [0x00989C35]
Of course they are. And they're going to jump out of the Shadows any moment now and carry you off to Hell.

Id: [0x00989C39]
Did you ever lay Eyes on a more sinister Sight? Bones everywhere. And those Paintings...

Id: [0x00989C3A]
Aye, it goes against all Decency and Nature alright. They say these Mayans would rip the beating Heart right out of a Man's Chest.

Id: [0x00989C3B]
We've no place being here, if you ask me.

Id: [0x00989C3C]
Captain Walters supposes it thick with hidden Treasures.

Id: [0x00989C3D]
Let us pray that's all it's thick with.

Id: [0x00989C40]
Be quick about it, Harris. The Tide'll be upon us soon.

Id: [0x00989C41]
I can't find anything, Sir. There's nothing here to open that Door.

Id: [0x00989C42]
It's there, and by God you're going to find it, even if you're up to your Neck in Brine.

Id: [0x00989C43]
Couldn't we just blow it open with some powder Barrels, sir?

Id: [0x00989C44]
Aye, and bring the whole damned Temple down on our Heads. Find it!

Id: [0x00989C45]
Yes, Sir.

Id: [0x00989C48]
It's bad Luck this. We're desecrating a holy Place.

Id: [0x00989C49]
Everything's bad Luck to you. You spent a Month below Deck last time we spied an Albatross. Besides, there's nothing holy about Mayans. Uncivilized Heathens, the lot of 'em.

Id: [0x00989C4A]
Heathens or not, we're courting Misfortune. Can't you feel the Dread seeping from these Rocks?

Id: [0x00989C4B]
I feel the Dread of listening to your bloody Gibbering for the rest of my Days.

Id: [0x00989C4F]
Didn't I tell ya to heave out these bloody Corpses?

Id: [0x00989C50]
Aye, sir. But the Smell makes it strenuous work. Some of the Lads had to stop to purge themselves.

Id: [0x00989C51]
Get them out by Day's end or there'll be fresh Bodies fouling up the Air.

Id: [0x00989C52]
Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989C55]
You fancy joining your Pal down in the Drink there? [laughs]

Id: [0x00989C56]
No! Please, I don't know anything!

Id: [0x00989C57]
Sure ya do. Where do you keep the Gold, ya filthy Cur?

Id: [0x00989C58]
I swear! We just mine the Stuff. Please! Don't kill me!

Id: [0x00989C59]
Bah!

Id: [0x00989C5C]
Mighty convenient, don't ya think? Flood kills everyone, leaves the Gold free for us to find...

Id: [0x00989C5D]
Won't get no Complaints from me. Scavenging's as honest a Profession as any.

Id: [0x00989C5E]
Aye, easiest Spoils we ever seized. Assuming we can find the bloody Stuff.

Id: [0x00989C5F]
Don't worry. Captain won't be leaving till we've found every damned Nugget.

Id: [0x00989C63]
Intruder!

Id: [0x00989C64]
Defend the cave!

Id: [0x00989C65]
We're under attack!

Id: [0x00989C66]
Kill him!

Id: [0x00989C67]
Intruder alert!

Id: [0x00989C68]
Find him!

Id: [0x00989C69]
Intruder!

Id: [0x00989C6A]
Shoot to kill!

Id: [0x00989C6B]
Where is he!?

Id: [0x00989C6C]
Don't let him our alive!

Id: [0x00989C6D]
We have an intruder!

Id: [0x00989C6E]
Somebody shoot him!

Id: [0x00989C6F]
We have an intruder!

Id: [0x00989C70]
I want him dead!

Id: [0x00989C80]
That Ship wanders a little too close to the Fort, don't you agree, Captain?

Id: [0x00989C82]
The Tower has her in his sights. She won't last long in the water.

Id: [0x00989C84]
Mortar incoming! We must keep moving!

Id: [0x00989C86]
We cannot hit the Mortar from here, Captain. We should aim for the towers!

Id: [0x00989C88]
Aim for the Towers, Captain!

Id: [0x00989C8A]
We can't take much more damage, Captain! We should brace when we're under fire!

Id: [0x00989C8C]
We should get closer, Captain. Finish the job.

Id: [0x00989C8E]
Wait here. I'll fare better alone.

Id: [0x00989C91]
Hello? Is anyone up there?

Id: [0x00989C92]
Come on down. It's my Rat's birthday Party!

Id: [0x00989C93]
Anyone there? I've discovered the Means to end all Wars, but I'm not telling you. [giggles]

Id: [0x00989C94]
It's all right! I'm perfectly comfortable down here. I have some delicious Tea.

Id: [0x00989C95]
It's a lovely Day, isn't it?

Id: [0x00989C96]
Would you kindly tell the Duke to cancel his Ball? All that dancing makes a terrible Noise.

Id: [0x00989C99]
Hey, What's that in the Fog? It looks like a Ship!

Id: [0x00989C9A]
I've heard of such a Vessel, Captain, stalking its Prey is the ocean Mists. The HMS Prince.

Id: [0x00989C9B]
And you believe it intends to hunt us next?

Id: [0x00989C9C]
If it is the Prince, she will not rest until she has destroyed us.

Id: [0x00989C9D]
Or we have destroyed her.

Id: [0x00989CA0]
She looks like a Ghost Ship!

Id: [0x00989CA1]
Aye, risen from the Dead to sink us!

Id: [0x00989CA2]
Be careful, Captain. She will use the fog to her Advantage.

Id: [0x00989CA4]
I tire of this. If only the Wind would disperse this damned Fog!

Id: [0x00989CA5]
The HMS Prince has an uncanny Ability to seek out such Conditions. She strikes Terror into the  Hearts of most Mariners.

Id: [0x00989CA6]
Perhaps, but it's still a cowardly tactic.

Id: [0x00989CA7]
And a most effective one.

Id: [0x00989CAB]
[cheers]She's done for!

Id: [0x00989CAC]
Let her hide in the Depths of the Sea. Her Captain should have displayed more Courage.

Id: [0x00989CAD]
He lived the life of a Ghost. He belongs to the Mist now.

Id: [0x00989CAE]
He belongs to all Creatures who scavenge beneath the Waves. They will feast today.

Id: [0x00989CD6]
Looks like they're working together.

Id: [0x00989CD7]
Doing so is almost an Obsession for them. We should be careful, Captain.

Id: [0x00989CDA]
Two Man-o-wars, Captain!

Id: [0x00989CDB]
Aye, Captain, they always do. The HMS Sovereign and the HMS Conquest, captained by Siblings.

Id: [0x00989CDC]
The Brothers-in-Arms. I know of them. They've sunk many a Pirate.

Id: [0x00989CDF]
They're heading straight for us!

Id: [0x00989CE0]
We're outnumbered!

Id: [0x00989CE1]
They're fast and know no Fear, Captain. This will be no easy Battle.

Id: [0x00989CE2]
Perhaps they ought to be reunited at the bottom of the Sea.

Id: [0x00989CE5]
What do you know about these Brothers, Adé?

Id: [0x00989CE6]
Their Father's Vessel was sunk by Pirates many Years ago.

Id: [0x00989CE7]
And now they seek Revenge on all who hoist the Black Flag.

Id: [0x00989CE8]
Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989CEB]
We did it! They're both gone!

Id: [0x00989CEC]
Vengeance is a Noble motive, but Rage made them too wild.

Id: [0x00989CED]
Theirs was a doomed Family. They were destined to end this Way.

Id: [0x00989CEE]
And ours was the Hand that sealed that Fate.

Id: [0x00989CEF]
She's set herself on Fire!

Id: [0x00989CF0]
What?!

Id: [0x00989CF1]
She's charging at us!

Id: [0x00989CF2]
She intends to take us down with her!

Id: [0x00989CF3]
Veer off, Captain! Veer off!

Id: [0x00989CF4]
Change Course, Sir! We must get out of her Way!

Id: [0x00989CF5]
She will burn out if we can avoid her Charges long enough!

Id: [0x00989CF8]
The Captain must have lost his Mind!

Id: [0x00989CF9]
Grief took his Mind long ago!

Id: [0x00989CFC]
Ship ho! Look at the size of her!

Id: [0x00989CFD]
The Weapons, the black Hull... It can only be La Dama Negra.

Id: [0x00989CFE]
What do you know of her?

Id: [0x00989CFF]
She's a floating Fortress, Captain. Very likely the most heavily armored Ship on the Ocean, with over a hundred Cannons.

Id: [0x00989D00]
But I wager she's slow in the Water.

Id: [0x00989D01]
Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989D04]
She's sinking fast! We did it!

Id: [0x00989D05]
The mightiest Vessel ever constructed, and we sent her down to the ocean Floor.

Id: [0x00989D06]
Let the History Books reflect on that. And let them speak of a far nobler Ship: the Jackdaw.

Id: [0x00989D07]
They will, Captain. I am sure of it.

Id: [0x00989D0A]
She may look impressive, but Castles belong on Land. A foolish Endeavor.

Id: [0x00989D0B]
La Dama Negra was meant to turn the Tide of War in Spain's favor, but she was completed too late for that.

Id: [0x00989D0C]
We shouldn't underestimate her Defenses, sir. Or her Firepower.

Id: [0x00989D0D]
The heavier she is, the faster she'll go down.

Id: [0x00989D10]
You seen the Armor on her? We'll never make a dent in that Thing!

Id: [0x00989D11]
She's flying a Spanish Flag! Won't take too kindly to Pirates!

Id: [0x00989D12]
We must find where her Armor is at its lightest, Captain!

Id: [0x00989D15]
Ship sighted! Oh... She's a Beast!

Id: [0x00989D16]
Have you ever seen anything like it?

Id: [0x00989D17]
Few who have seen it survive, Captain. She's The Impoluto. Captained by a Spanish Madman, they say.

Id: [0x00989D18]
His Name is Don Pasamonte, and he is less a Pirate than a Curse upon the Ocean. He attacks every Vessel he sees. Be careful, captain.

Id: [0x00989D1B]
What's she doing?

Id: [0x00989D1C]
She's coming straight at us!

Id: [0x00989D1D]
Beat to Quarters, lads!

Id: [0x00989D20]
Yeaaahhh! She's sunk!

Id: [0x00989D21]
We have done a great Thing, Sir. The Impoluto has been the Ruin of too many Vessels.

Id: [0x00989D22]
They say Pasamonte lost his Mind during the War. Perhaps he can find Peace now.

Id: [0x00989D23]
He can find Peace in Hell. Let him and his Ship rot there.

Id: [0x00989D26]
She behaves like a wild Animal!

Id: [0x00989D27]
Pasamonte is as feared as Blackbeard in these Parts. To many he is the Devil, and the Impoluto is a Hell-ship.

Id: [0x00989D28]
What manner of Crew would work under such a Man?

Id: [0x00989D29]
One accustomed to Madness, captain.

Id: [0x00989D2C]
It's the White Whale!

Id: [0x00989D2D]
There she blows! The White Whale!

Id: [0x00989D32]
Over here!

Id: [0x00989D33]
Need some Work?

Id: [0x00989D34]
I have a Proposition!

Id: [0x00989D35]
How would you like a privateering Contract?

Id: [0x00989D36]
My employer has a substantial Reward if you can help.

Id: [0x00989D37]
You look like you could handle a delicate Job.

Id: [0x00989D38]
My boss is looking for a Privateer.

Id: [0x00989D39]
Would you be interested in some privateering Work?

Id: [0x00989D3A]
I think you'll find this Job rather interesting.

Id: [0x00989D40]
What the Devil is that?!

Id: [0x00989D41]
Waterspout!

Id: [0x00989D42]
It's headed straight for us!

Id: [0x00989D43]
Take cover!

Id: [0x00989D46]
Our merchant Friend has earned himself some serious Enemies.

Id: [0x00989D47]
Aye, Captain. They seem rather committed to his Capture.

Id: [0x00989D48]
Christ! This Reward had better be worth it.

Id: [0x00989D4B]
I'm not sure the Jackdaw can handle such a challenge right now, Captain. Perhaps we should turn back.

Id: [0x00989D4C]
We may not yet be ready for such an encounter, Captain.

Id: [0x00989D4D]
The Jackdaw is a fine ship, but she may not be prepared for such an enemy.

Id: [0x00989D4E]
Aye, and in Something of a Hurry. I propose we follow... else they spring Something we ain't ready for.

Id: [0x00989D51]
There's Movement up ahead. Is it Soldiers?

Id: [0x00989D90]
We cannot pass them undetected, Captain. And there is no other Way.

Id: [0x00989D91]
There's always another Way.

Id: [0x00989D92]
All stop.

Id: [0x00989D94]
I'll be back with the Medicines.

Id: [0x00989D95]
Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989D97]
They're getting away, Captain.

Id: [0x00989DF8]
Is it over yet?

Id: [0x00989DF9]
Isn't anybody going to help me?

Id: [0x00989DFA]
They're just going to leave us here, aren't they?

Id: [0x00989DFB]
Help!

Id: [0x00989DFF]
What's your thinking?

Id: [0x00989E00]
Blackbeard's been at this eight Days already, so it's a good Bet someone out there has prepared the Medicines, just in Case.

Id: [0x00989E03]
Aye. So let's find where they've gathered and hope for the Best.

Id: [0x00989E06]
Careful, Captain. We're drifting close to a Watchtower.

Id: [0x00989E07]
Them Watchtower's might spot us. Best keep out of Sight.

Id: [0x00989E08]
There's another Watchtower.

Id: [0x00989E0A]
We should avoid those Patrols, Captain.

Id: [0x00989E0B]
Patrols, just there. We should plot a new Course.

Id: [0x00989E0C]
Another patrol Ship. Steer clear of 'em.

Id: [0x00989E0E]
Keep her at Half-Sail, Captain. Speed'll do us no Favors here.

Id: [0x00989E10]
Slow down, Captain. Let them pass by.

Id: [0x00989E13]
Careful with the Banks.

Id: [0x00989E14]
Let us hope the River remains this wide.

Id: [0x00989E15]
Be sure they don't Spy us trailing them.

Id: [0x00989E16]
Steady as she goes, Captain.

Id: [0x00989E17]
I see them. Over there.

Id: [0x00989E18]
If we run aground here, we may never get out.

Id: [0x00989E1C]
Who goes there?!

Id: [0x00989E1D]
Calm down, Clark, it's only us.

Id: [0x00989E20]
Identify yourself!

Id: [0x00989E21]
Privates Ryder and Thomas.

Id: [0x00989E24]
What's that? Someone there?

Id: [0x00989E25]
It's us. We're reporting to the Captain.

Id: [0x00989E26]
Carry on!

Id: [0x00989E29]
Ryder! I was starting to think you'd got lost.

Id: [0x00989E2A]
No such Luck, Mate.

Id: [0x00989E2B]
Well, keep a Watch for Crocodiles up ahead. Swamp's full of the Buggers.

Id: [0x00989E2C]
What? Does he jest?

Id: [0x00989E30]
What was that?

Id: [0x00989E31]
I don't know, but let's not find out.

Id: [0x00989E33]
Did you hear that Noise?

Id: [0x00989E34]
It's just the Trees creaking.

Id: [0x00989E35]
Or Something making them creak...

Id: [0x00989E3B]
If Heat or the Reptiles don't finish us, it'll be these damnable Insects.

Id: [0x00989E3C]
Aye, the Mosquitoes'll sup every last ounce of Vitality from us.

Id: [0x00989E3F]
You think it's true what they say about Blackbeard? That Fire strikes out from his Head? As if from some Volcano?

Id: [0x00989E40]
If he's not the Devil himself, then surely he's made some Pact with Hell. Only be thankful his Ship remains anchored, and hasn't torn a Path into the Heart of Charles-Towne.

Id: [0x00989E41]
Bloody Pirates. Someone ought to do something.

Id: [0x00989E42]
They'll be hunted down eventually. Every last One of them.

Id: [0x00989E45]
Who's that there?

Id: [0x00989E46]
Two old 'Gators come for their Supper.

Id: [0x00989E47]
Ryder, me old Mucker. Bit warm tonight, ain't it?

Id: [0x00989E48]
We'll talk about the Weather another Time, Mate. Bit of a hurry.

Id: [0x00989E4A]
This Blockade best end soon. I'm going land-crazy, and this dirty Puddle won't do.

Id: [0x00989E4B]
One would suppose all this was for Gold. Or Rum at least.

Id: [0x00989E4C]
Nothing but Medicines to cure whatever Ailments fester aboard their Vessels.

Id: [0x00989E4D]
Syphilis and Scurvy, no doubt. What noxious Coffins these Pirate ships must be.

Id: [0x00989E50]
What was that?! It was a Crocodile, wasn't it? It's coming straight for us, I can feel it.

Id: [0x00989E53]
You seen any Crocodiles tonight? I could've sworn I saw something pass the Boat.

Id: [0x00989E54]
Nope, quiet Night.

Id: [0x00989E55]
Are you sure? I heard something in the Water.

Id: [0x00989E56]
Quiet 'til you showed up. Go on then. Captain's waiting.

Id: [0x00989E59]
Almost there.

Id: [0x00989E5A]
Good. Captain Wyatt is not a patient Man.

Id: [0x00989E5C]
Hullo! Is that Ryder yonder?

Id: [0x00989E5D]
The very same.

Id: [0x00989E5E]
Then speed along. You're expected. And you know how--

Id: [0x00989E60]
[screams - killed by crocodile]

Id: [0x00989E61]
Oh Christ!

Id: [0x00989E62]
It took him! It took him! I told you!

Id: [0x00989E63]
Just row, for godsakes! Row!

Id: [0x00989E66]
I told you there was something! Didn't I tell you? Oh god...

Id: [0x00989E67]
Let's just get out of here.

Id: [0x00989E6A]
Can't you make this thing go any faster?

Id: [0x00989E6B]
I'm trying! I'm trying!

Id: [0x00989E6D]
Is it after us? Can you see it?

Id: [0x00989E6E]
Don't think about it. Just row. Row!

Id: [0x00989E70]
I don't want to die here!

Id: [0x00989E71]
We'll be there any Second now. Don't worry.

Id: [0x00989E74]
Thank Christ! I thought we'd never make it.

Id: [0x00989E76]
Private Ryder reporting, sir.

Id: [0x00989E77]
And doing so with great Delay.

Id: [0x00989E78]
I apologize, sir. There was an Accident. Private Simon-- this Crocodile--

Id: [0x00989E79]
I don't care about your Accidents. What's the Word from the Harbor, Soldier? Speak!

Id: [0x00989E7A]
No change, sir. They're holding fast but are yet to kill or maim any of the Captives, near as we can tell. Perhaps it's Time to--

Id: [0x00989E7B]
To surrender? I've been entrusted with the Affairs of the Town, and I do not intend to bow to the Demands of a Pirate, no matter how fierce his Reputation.

Id: [0x00989E7C]
Yes, Sir.

Id: [0x00989E7D]
As long as the supply Key is with me, no Man shall touch that Medicine. May Plague and Calamity strike them all.

Id: [0x00989E80]
Bloody Idiot.

Id: [0x00989E83]
What?!

Id: [0x00989E84]
Intruder! Help!

Id: [0x00989E86]
Stop him!

Id: [0x00989E87]
Do something, you Fools!

Id: [0x00989E88]
Somebody shoot him!

Id: [0x00989E89]
Help!

Id: [0x00989E8A]
Kill him! Kill him!

Id: [0x00989E8D]
Someone's after the Captain!

Id: [0x00989E8E]
What's going on?!

Id: [0x00989E8F]
Hey! Stop!

Id: [0x00989E90]
There's an Intruder! Get 'im!

Id: [0x00989E91]
Do something!

Id: [0x00989E92]
He's going for the Captain!

Id: [0x00989E93]
Careful with the Gunpowder Barrels!

Id: [0x00989E94]
Don't hit the Gunpowder!

Id: [0x00989E96]
What the Hell?!

Id: [0x00989E97]
Hey!

Id: [0x00989E98]
[Startled shout]

Id: [0x00989E9B]
Close the Gate!

Id: [0x00989E9C]
Good.

Id: [0x00989E9D]
Stay here. Shoot anything that moves.

Id: [0x00989E9E]
Come on. It's time.

Id: [0x00989E9F]
Tell me about the beach.

Id: [0x00989EA0]
A fair gathering, sir. Most too drunk to stand.

Id: [0x00989EA1]
That will suit our purpose.

Id: [0x00989EA3]
I thought for a moment I'd die there. Those bloody savages.

Id: [0x00989EA4]
Have no fear, soldier. This will be the end of them.

Id: [0x00989EA7]
What?!

Id: [0x00989EA8]
Get him!

Id: [0x00989EC1]
Stations, lads!

Id: [0x00989EC2]
Today you fight for your lives! And for your freedom!

Id: [0x00989EC3]
We'll teach them to fear the black flag!

Id: [0x00989EC5]
Mortar!

Id: [0x00989EC7]
Captain! Broadside!

Id: [0x00989EC9]
She's heading right for us, captain!

Id: [0x00989ECA]
Brace!

Id: [0x00989ECC]
Board!

Id: [0x00989ED1]
[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x00989ED4]
[Laugh]Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x00989ED8]
Maybe he remembers where his Rat is hiding before my Aim markedly improves.

Id: [0x00989EDD]
[To himself]That flushed him out.[to Thatch] I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x00989F05]
She's ready to be boarded!

Id: [0x00989F06]
Brace! Braaaaace!

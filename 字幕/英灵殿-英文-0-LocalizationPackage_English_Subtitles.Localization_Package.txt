Id: [0x00274921]
This is true happiness, isn't it, men? Life in the rough, in the company of friends, sitting beside a carefree river!

Id: [0x00274BE3]
Right behind you, shadow-walker.

Id: [0x00274BE6]
All right. But be wary. I won't be the swiftest sword if all this goes tits up, you should know.

Id: [0x00274BE9]
It was, and should still be! O, to see it now fills my eyes with tears.

Id: [0x00274BEB]
One day, I won't have to skulk around this town with my face hidden. I will walk proudly among the people I love.

Id: [0x00274BF2]
There's damp on the air. I fear gray clouds will gather soon.

Id: [0x00274BF3]
Aye. And foul deeds are brewing. The horses can feel it too, neighing and rolling their eyes.

Id: [0x00274E54]
No one has heard from the ealdorman in weeks? What's happened?

Id: [0x00274E55]
Lord Hundbeorht is surely fighting the Danes to the north.

Id: [0x00274E91]
Acha! Herefrith! Tell Lord Hundbeorht his son has returned!

Id: [0x00274E92]
My lord! You're well.

Id: [0x00274E94]
What on earth do you mean by that? What storm?

Id: [0x00274EDA]
Aelfgar, my dear man, I do not need a map to prove what my bones know for truth.

Id: [0x00274F18]
What? Where?

Id: [0x00274F19]
Hunwald! Praise God, you live!

Id: [0x00274F33]
I am hot for a fight, snow-dog! Give me half a chance, and I'll stove your heathen face right in!

Id: [0x00274F5E]
You're losing ground, you drunken sot!

Id: [0x00274F65]
More Mercians traipsing across our routes. Can't piss from here to Bolingbroc without someone demanding some ungodly deal.

Id: [0x00274F66]
All this traffic has made smuggling a difficult job.

Id: [0x00274F67]
Smuggling will always be difficult. But I prefer it to paying tribute. Never again will we bend to the Mercian crown.

Id: [0x00274F78]
Jesus, my bones are aching. Could use a dip in the sea.

Id: [0x00274F79]
Shut your hinge, Cearl. And stop dripping blood in my hall.

Id: [0x00274F7B]
A worthy tussle, Dane! Give this one a cup of mead! They are not the dogs we take them for.

Id: [0x00274F87]
At times, I wonder what in God's name we are here for. Hundbeorht is his own prisoner.

Id: [0x00274F89]
Why can we not enter the keep now? Is it all gold and silver up there?

Id: [0x00274F8A]
Pipe down, lad. And keep your nose out of that business. It's not a topic you need knowing about.

Id: [0x00275029]
O, I have been struck down! Pruned within an inch of my life! But I will survive, I must.

Id: [0x00275053]
O, you poor boy. I'm so, so sorry.

Id: [0x0027506C]
I would tell you my fate is in the hands of our Lord. But somehow I believe that won't be the whole story.

Id: [0x00275077]
Here's Lincoln. The city of my birth, the cauldron of my present sorrows.

Id: [0x00275078]
Give my best to Aelfgar and Hunwald, should you see them.

Id: [0x002750B8]
A hearty hello, drengr (courageous warrior). Seems Britain is getting quite used to the idea of Danes stalking her shores.

Id: [0x002750E9]
Mother of God! Another battle!

Id: [0x002750EC]
Hold steady, ealdorman. Grab any arm you can!

Id: [0x002750ED]
Ah! God deliver us from this evil!

Id: [0x00275103]
Devils! Who sent you? Speak or be damned!

Id: [0x00275104]
Eivor! I am sweating from pit to toe! Do not leave me here.

Id: [0x00275106]
The safest spot in the shire, yes!

Id: [0x0027510C]
Fire! Fire!

Id: [0x0027510E]
Mercian dogs!

Id: [0x00275110]
Take the thegn! Kill the rest.

Id: [0x00275111]
Burn it all! Down to ashes!

Id: [0x00275170]
Never have I seen such violence in our great hall. It's a battlefield.

Id: [0x00275173]
A bold attack. And in broad daylight! The hatred that eats at that man must be ravenous.

Id: [0x00275176]
Such carnage I've never seen. That twisted bishop must pay the devil his due.

Id: [0x00275177]
We've learned that Herefrith rode for the fort at Anecastre following the massacre.

Id: [0x0027517B]
We have learned that Herefrith occupies the fort at Anecastre, south of here.

Id: [0x0027517C]
Today has been a boon, Eivor. In spite of everything, I now know my father's spirit still burns within me. It's thanks to you I know this.

Id: [0x00275180]
Our Lord is not a trained dog who speaks on command. My goodness.

Id: [0x00275182]
Here's the camp, do you see? The fyrd will soon be ready for action!

Id: [0x00275183]
Our camp is just here. When the fyrd is ready, we'll attack with speed.

Id: [0x00275184]
We are the men of Lincolnscire. Remember it!

Id: [0x00275185]
Who's fetching the turf this time? Eh? Don't want to freeze to death here!

Id: [0x00275186]
This battle will be fucking Hell, and my boots have holes the size of chestnuts. Jesus.

Id: [0x0027518B]
He's … he's in the chapel there. Hiding away. Scabrous coward.

Id: [0x0027518D]
Some respite, lord, please. Our battle is lost.

Id: [0x002751F7]
I must beg forgiveness from my God. The Lord lifts up the meek … we must praise Him.

Id: [0x00275202]
Continue the work of God, my boy. Kill this pagan!

Id: [0x00275239]
Mercian Housecarls! We're under attack!

Id: [0x00275250]
Here I am, with a chance to be ealdorman, but I have yet to prove myself worthy. To you. To the Shire. To her!

Id: [0x00275261]
Good, good. But let me say unreservedly that I am the man who will lead Lincolnscire into progress and victory.

Id: [0x00275297]
My ancestors fought with the old kings of Lindsey. It's for their memory we fight today.

Id: [0x002752A2]
Burn this Dane-lover down!

Id: [0x002752A3]
For Burgred, the one true Mercian king!

Id: [0x002752AB]
Hunwald! I thought for sure you'd be dead. Why didn't you send word?

Id: [0x002752AC]
It has been far too long, my little jewel. I'm so very sorry for that.

Id: [0x002752AD]
I am fine, my love. I wilted without you, but still I grow. And who is this?

Id: [0x002752AE]
Ah, yes, I am proud to present, Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002752BD]
Caught me a sturgeon on the river, yestermorn. Rare as teeth on a rooster, they are.

Id: [0x002752C3]
Blood soaked into stone.

Id: [0x002753C2]
Remember … God punishes those who wish ill upon … upon…

Id: [0x002753C3]
Go on … ill upon who?

Id: [0x002753C4]
Eh? Sorry, I was miles away. What?

Id: [0x002753C5]
Christ Jesus. You haven't got enough brains in your head to blink, have you?

Id: [0x002753C9]
He's an ill man, leave him be. Besides, we ain't got it too rough. We can hunt in the wolds of Lindsey and whore in Botolphston.

Id: [0x002753CA]
Too right, too right. I've gone dumb with idle time. Grab some ale, and let us skin some animals later.

Id: [0x002753E6]
I am a man, Acha! Do you hear me? I am a man, and I am my father's son. Do not forget it!

Id: [0x002753F6]
He is, and a good man as well. But I cast my stone for the bishop.

Id: [0x002753F8]
Have I heard aright? That you have come to break us from our deadlock?

Id: [0x00275497]
That's them being horses, mate.

Id: [0x002754A9]
Me? O, goodness no, I'm no skald. No. Just a humble nobleman with an interest in versification! An amateur really…

Id: [0x002754FE]
EIVOR (#BUG1)

Id: [0x00275589]
My prayers are fervent and my will is strong, Eivor. If I am ealdorman, I will bring joy to this shire!

Id: [0x002755B5]
Eivor, I realize the strides you've taken to aid me. My oath to you will last an eternity.

Id: [0x002755B7]
Blood? Dear Lord…

Id: [0x002755BC]
Eh? Who comes?

Id: [0x002755C2]
Please. Do not desecrate our lord.

Id: [0x002755DB]
Bishop Herefrith among them. He's kept a vigil at the town hall, looking after things in your father's absence, until he returns.

Id: [0x002755DC]
There were men with swords and those of the cloth. And a healer too, one who had oft been a guest in this house.

Id: [0x002755E7]
I know you mean well, bishop. But there's no cause to insult Swanburrow's honor. You leave my ladylove out of this.

Id: [0x002755EA]
You should have sent forewarning of your return to avoid the violence that dogs you. Lives might have been spared.

Id: [0x002755EB]
We had no news of your return. You might have sent a messenger and spared us the suspense.

Id: [0x002755EE]
Hunwald, your father was at my hospice for a time, but he left of his own accord, without saying a word. That's all we know.

Id: [0x00275629]
He still has friends in Lincoln, that's a good sign.

Id: [0x0027562B]
You mean soldiers and the like? Aye, there have been many, many more about since your father took his leave.

Id: [0x0027567E]
Your father was at my hospice for some days, and very well treated. But he left in secret, that's all we know.

Id: [0x00275688]
Of course, of course! Strength and wisdom and fortitude and all that.

Id: [0x002756C9]
It is decreed by this lawful shiremoot that the Ealdorman of Lincolnscire shall be…

Id: [0x002756CE]
I … I don't know what to say. I thank you, deeply, madly, humbly. What more can I say … I … I don't know…

Id: [0x002756DB]
My home is just there. We've made it!

Id: [0x002756DF]
Though we be a Mercian shire today, tomorrow the Kingdom of Lindsey will rise again.

Id: [0x002756E0]
Your line of kings died long ago, Hunwald. We're in Lincolnscire now. Do you need a map to remember?

The wind is strong, but you are stronger. Just hold on.

Id: [0x00275744]
Stay back. Do not touch this tree!

Id: [0x00275746]
Mae…

Id: [0x00275748]
It's the leaves. My father said he would return home before they'd all fallen to the ground.

Id: [0x00275749]
I wish he stayed. Just one more season. He was so sure the fields wouldn't yield, but we could have tried!

Id: [0x0027575A]
Then what should I do?

Id: [0x00275760]
Stop talking like that! He'll come back! He said so! Just … just leave me be.

Id: [0x00275762]
Maybe … maybe I'll wait just a little bit longer. 'Til the goats begin to bray, or … yes, a little longer.

Id: [0x00275763]
He'll be back, you'll see! Before the leaves fall, just like he said!

Id: [0x00275765]
Ah!

Id: [0x00275766]
What! No! No no no! You…[sigh] I suppose that's it, then …

Id: [0x00275769]
No! You wicked devil! I told you not to do that!

Id: [0x0027576B]
Leave me alone! And never come back! I don't ever want to see you again!

Id: [0x00275785]
But they have reached a tie. Four votes for each man.

Id: [0x0027579F]
Hello, Eivor. A pleasure to meet you.

Id: [0x00275818]
Ah, yes, to Lincoln! Away! But with care. The road between here and there is teeming with brigands who wish me dead.

Id: [0x00275819]
You daft lump of lard. A single Dane will not protect you against the whole of Mercia's army.

Id: [0x0027581D]
I'm his voice of reason, Eivor. And I've told him a thousand times, it's too dangerous for him in Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x00275824]
Eivor! My bladder is bursting! I must step outside for a long deserved slash! Keep them dancing 'til I return!

Id: [0x0027582E]
Because my father is honest. And a friend to all people, Saxons and Danes alike.

Id: [0x00275833]
And you shall have it! My father is a great friend of the Danes, in spite of the recent wars.

Id: [0x00275847]
O, banish the thought that such a great man should perish.

Id: [0x0027584A]
Hide! Hide!

Id: [0x00275850]
Die!

Id: [0x002758B4]
Because her name alone dries the tongues of my enemies. If such a hero fought beside me, I'd fear nothing.

Id: [0x002758B5]
Ah, by God's blood, my day begins with a lash of good fortune!

Id: [0x002758B6]
I am Hunwald, loyal son of Lord Hundbeorht, the current Ealdorman of Lincolnscire, may God keep and cure him.

Id: [0x002758B9]
You see, my father is ailing. And in his delirium, evil men have corrupted his judgment. A secret and powerful order, if the whispers are true.

Id: [0x002758BB]
Could one of your clan help me return to Lincoln?

Id: [0x00276F22]
O, thank the heavens, there she is!

Id: [0x00276F24]
Are we talking about the same man? Your father is a spendthrift, Hunwald. He ran this shire into the muck.

Id: [0x002789B5]
My lord, you carried yourself as a true-born king, born in a time of wolves. You have earned a long rest.

Id: [0x002789B6]
Thank you, beautiful Galwyna. So firm is your loyalty. None know me as well as you do.

Id: [0x002789B9]
Thank you, lord. It is now time for your bath. May I wash you?

Id: [0x002789BA]
Yes, good, good. Time for the washing. The very last washing. Very good indeed.

Id: [0x002789E2]
What's happened?

Id: [0x002789E4]
Let them try. I'll cut their throats.

Id: [0x002789E6]
What if I left it all behind, my love? Forget my father's seat. What if I stayed here with you? Just the two of us.

Id: [0x002789E8]
Yes … If anyone can lift my spirits in time for the Shiremoot, it's you, my dear.

Id: [0x002789EA]
I'm sorry. My will falters from time to time. After some rest, my senses will return.

Id: [0x002789EC]
Yes … yes, resting next to my angel will heal all that is broken within me.

Id: [0x002789F0]
My blade will keep him safe.

Id: [0x002789F2]
Of course. You're welcome to search through his effects, though I'm not sure what trinket would best serve your purpose.

Id: [0x002789F8]
You canny fox. That was incredible!

Id: [0x002789FA]
You travel with a marked man at your side.

Id: [0x002789FC]
(scream)

Id: [0x002789FF]
Eivor! Come! Sit!

Id: [0x00278A00]
I have been discussing my delicate situation with Aelfgar here.

Id: [0x00278A01]
Hunwald's idea of sturdy is a mug of ale that won't tip over.

Id: [0x00278A03]
Aelfgar has pledged his loyalty to my family, the house of the ferocious swan!

Id: [0x00278A2A]
You! How dare you!

Id: [0x00278A2B]
Crowland's throne belongs only to the one true King of Briars!

Id: [0x00278A2D]
How dare you insult the brave and valorous soldiers of--

Id: [0x00278A38]
Insolent ferret! Kill this usurper!

Id: [0x00278A3A]
Crowland is ours, cur!

Id: [0x00278F5B]
Yes … yes, you're right. Let's depart.

Id: [0x002792A6]
Only a month ago, without forewarning, Mercian soldiers chased me, his only son, from my home.

Id: [0x002792A8]
O, indeed! I will plunge into the heat of battle to defend my father, knowing our cause is a righteous one!

Id: [0x00279EDD]
(scream)

Id: [0x00279EE5]
Go on, Lord-Boy. Make me tremble.

Id: [0x00279EE8]
Goodbye, Lord-Boy! Safe travels!

Id: [0x00279EE9]
That might shut him up.

Id: [0x00279EF3]
Well, that's, uh … that's kind of you. Unexpected like.

Id: [0x00279EF7]
Jesus! He's brought a bloody Dane!

Id: [0x00279F00]
O thank you, thank you! You'll save me from a decade of shame.

Id: [0x00279F01]
What horrible souls are hunting me? Me, the son of a beloved ealdorman!

Id: [0x00279F07]
My heart beats like the drums of your dragon-boat.

Id: [0x00279F0B]
Galwyna. One of the sisters my father put great faith in.

Id: [0x00279F16]
I just adore the laughter of the water, the spice of mead in the nose, the spittle of shouting Danes!

Id: [0x00279F17]
Norse, you troll-wart!

Id: [0x00279F18]
Norse! Yes, forgive me. Norse…

Id: [0x00279F25]
Shall I continue…?

Id: [0x00279F27]
Y-yes, sorry.

Id: [0x00279F2A]
Yes, forgive me…

Id: [0x00279F3D]
God bless and keep you all!

Id: [0x00279F5B]
A what?

Id: [0x00279F5D]
Jesus. Fucking heathen.

Id: [0x00279F62]
Cheers to this Dane! One who knows the true worth of silver!

Id: [0x00279F75]
I must void my bladder, Eivor. Then we shall set forth in search of adventures new!

Id: [0x00279F84]
If I had a scribe jot down all the occasions I'd warned that stupid boy, I'd be the most written about man in history.

Id: [0x00279F87]
Continue as you would, Eivor! And if I should expire, avenge me!

Id: [0x00279F8E]
Aelfgar! We have won our first great victory.

Id: [0x00279F91]
Was it naive of me to believe my status as a nobleman held some sway over the ceorls and serfs of this shire? What cause have any to dishonor me?

Id: [0x00279FAC]
No, no. He's made a pact with them. There's peace now. Ain't you heard?

Id: [0x00279FAD]
Naw, that can't be true.

Id: [0x0027B977]
I do, my dear Raeganhere. Body and soul!

Id: [0x0027B978]
I'm sorry, lord, but your father has been taken.

Id: [0x0027B979]
Taken? When?

Id: [0x0027B97A]
Weeks ago, lord. And well ill he was when they carried him off. I wish I could say more.

Id: [0x0027B97B]
Mm. This is strong stuff.

Id: [0x0027B97C]
I taste a pinch of clover in the mead? Am I wrong?

Id: [0x0027B97D]
*Coughs* Ah! Ahem. Went down the wrong pipe!

Id: [0x0027B97E]
Mmm. Quite delicious.

Id: [0x0027B99A]
It's bad enough I've got these armored codpieces watching me work. Now you…

Id: [0x0027B9A8]
Tell my father, his son has returned, and in fighting form! It is urgent I speak with him.

Id: [0x0027B9A9]
O, I dare not go asking after him, for fear of stepping above my caste.

Id: [0x0027B9AB]
But he'll be in good hands, don't you worry. Up there with the abbess and her sisters and all.

Id: [0x0027B9AD]
On his own. It was the Abbess Acha who suggested he be moved. She feared his illness was fast coming.

Id: [0x0027B9AE]
He wasn't took, nor did he walk. He sort of limped his way on.

Id: [0x0027B9B3]
Lord Hunwald…

Id: [0x0027B9CE]
Lord Hundbeorht has gone, I'm afraid. He would not say where to, but I'm sure he will return shortly. Once the storm has passed.

Id: [0x0027B9CF]
Your father feared for his life, Hunwald. In his weakened state, he could not defend himself. Not against a Dane, certainly.

Id: [0x0027B9D2]
How dare you! Eivor is above reproach!

Id: [0x0027B9D3]
See this from my view, Hunwald! You arrive after a strange absence with a hired Viking in tow, demanding to see your father.

Id: [0x0027B9E7]
O, no…

Id: [0x0027B9E8]
Of course, my friend. I am a man of action above all else. Ready to leap and dance and fight!

Id: [0x0027BBCD]
This ain't worth the silver they's paying us!

Id: [0x0027BBCF]
I disagree. Everything this boy does concerns us. He's the son of our ealdorman.

Id: [0x0027BBD1]
So when I tell you we don't know where your father is, nor why he left our hospice in his ailing state … it's because we don't know.

Id: [0x0027BBE9]
I'll wait for you in my safe haven. Botolphston to the northeast.

Id: [0x0027BBF6]
In secret? That's odd. He's not one to scurry about in the dark.

Id: [0x0027BBF7]
I'm sorry, Hunwald. We have searched high and low for him but to no avail.

Id: [0x0027BBF8]
Such violence, good heavens. God must have purpose for you pagans in His holy plan, but I confess to utter bafflement.

Id: [0x0027BC00]
I have come with the hope of meeting Eivor, the great warrior of this clan … if such an audience is possible.

Id: [0x0027BC07]
Ow! Ah! Dammit…

Id: [0x0027BC0C]
Ah! You are the chieftain here! I suspected as much.

Id: [0x0027BC1A]
[laugh]O, Aelfgar, you jest!

Id: [0x0027BC1C]
I think you are wrong, Aelfgar.

Id: [0x0027BCF7]
It wern't wise to let those Mercians nobles use our tunnels, if you ask me.

Id: [0x0027BCF8]
What choice did we have? 'Least this way, they'll leave us be.

Id: [0x0027BCF9]
They killed one of their own! What's to stop 'em from splitting our skulls as well?

Id: [0x0027BCFA]
'Cause they fear us, see? No one takes us for fools, you got it?

Id: [0x0027BD10]
From there, we shall make our way to Lincoln.

Id: [0x0027BD17]
March beside me through the city gates and set me at my father's noble feet once again.

Id: [0x0027BD19]
If you offer an alliance in good faith, he will honor it.

Id: [0x0027BD1B]
I know not why, but I do know my father would never have ordered my exile.

Id: [0x0027BD20]
As free as the wind on the back of my neck.

Id: [0x0027BD22]
With his influence and your might, we shall rid Lincolnscire of the ruffians who plague this land, once and for all.

Id: [0x0027BD29]
Like watching a captain navigate the roiling waters of an angry river!

Id: [0x0027BD2C]
Unbelievable! The Battle of Botolphston will be remembered for years to come!

Id: [0x0027BD39]
Ah, your mystery Dane has a name.

Id: [0x0027BD3F]
I am simply worried that Lord Hundbeorht's wayward son is in danger of besmirching his reputation beyond repair. That is all.

Id: [0x0027BD40]
This does not, in my estimation, imply benign intentions.

Id: [0x0027BD43]
I all but raised you, lad. Bounced you on my knee and taught you scripture.

Id: [0x0027C8BC]
Bread and ale please, ale-wife!

Id: [0x0027C8BD]
And here she'll prove it…

Id: [0x0027C8E9]
Why so surprised to see my return, bishop? Was I rumored dead?

Id: [0x0027C8EA]
O, worse than dead. It is my reluctant duty to report the rumor that you were lost in the North, bedding a Dane on some squalid farm.

Id: [0x0027C8FD]
Don't let this one escape!

Id: [0x0027C906]
It is decided. By the grace of God, the new ealdorman is Lord Aelfgar of Lincoln.

Id: [0x0027C912]
Aye, the king sends his love and support. Whatever happens here today shall have his full blessing.

Id: [0x0027C9ED]
God has spoken, and his voice is a clarion call.

Id: [0x0027CA3F]
(whistling)

Id: [0x0027CA40]
(whistling)

Id: [0x0027CA4A]
To think such carnage could happen in Lincoln.

Id: [0x0027CBC4]
I value competent and righteous leadership. Not foolish friends in high seats.

Id: [0x0027CBCB]
They tried, yes. But they did not succeed, praise be to God.

Id: [0x0027CBCE]
I pray that God guides your vote today … and not the Devil, as I fear.

Id: [0x0027CBD8]
I love Hunwald as I love my own kin. But I would not put a stone in his care without fearing for the safety of both.

Id: [0x0027CBFA]
Ah! Eivor! Help!

Id: [0x0027CBFC]
You won't have my blood, not today!

Id: [0x0027CBFD]
Lord Hundbeorht was a bold and honest man, if somewhat reckless.

Id: [0x0027CD23]
Yes! Including my dear Swanburrow. My ladylove! Come, let us hurry away!

Id: [0x0027CD24]
Plain and clear! Follow me!

Id: [0x0027CD32]
Under my guidance, this shire is crawling back from a decade of lawlessness.

Id: [0x0027CE97]
I can do nothing without my darling lady. You've made me realize how much I've neglected her through this fatal stupor of mine!

Id: [0x0027CEA5]
Herefrith was a friend of my father's, and always so dear to me. I don't understand what possessed him.

Id: [0x0027CEA6]
This will send waves of disgust through all the parishes of Mercia. Herefrith is a new and ugly stain on the Bishopric.

Id: [0x0027CEA9]
You pagans and your appetite for battle. I certainly don't share it. I worry what diabolical feast the bishop has in store.

Id: [0x0027CEAA]
Don't let that poxy bishop worry you. With Eivor beside us, he'll be vittles before long.

Id: [0x0027CEAB]
How has Acha taken all this? She and Herefrith were so close.

Id: [0x0027CEAC]
She must feel as though the Devil himself attacked her monastery, the poor lady.

Id: [0x0027CEAD]
Manipulated by a man who should be God's gladdener.

Id: [0x0027CED9]
And twice failed!

Id: [0x0027CFD7]
Herefrith, the bog rat, the shit-eater! The devil has him, that's plain to see.

Id: [0x0027CFD8]
Bloody murderer. Our shire … what remains … my Heaven awaits.

Id: [0x0027D051]
Surprised to find a Dane by his side?

Id: [0x0027D053]
As every boat needs an anchor, every man needs his Swanburrow. The light of my life.

Id: [0x0027D055]
Eivor has been my champion as I stake my claim in Lincolnscire. But I'm afraid it hasn't gone as well as I'd hoped.

Id: [0x0027D081]
I shall take you to your family crypt at Nettleham within Lincoln. There you may lay beside your forebearers, the great and glorious kings of old Lindsey.

Id: [0x0027D08B]
Wait. What?

Id: [0x0027D0E1]
Leave us be. It is not your place to be asking such questions.

Id: [0x0027D902]
Father, give me strength to survive this!

Id: [0x0027D904]
Eivor, what a pleasant surprise! Would you drink with me?

Id: [0x0027DA09]
Eivor agreed to help me find my father. But I'm afraid it hasn't gone as well as I'd hoped.

Id: [0x0027DCF7]
I'm sorry, Hunwald. I had already asked a priest to administer last rites when your father disappeared.

Id: [0x0027DCF8]
You lied to me!

Id: [0x0027DCF9]
You silly sobbing moon-calf. Will you never grow up?

Id: [0x0027DCFC]
A moot is a meeting of lords. We convene from time to time to steer the course of our shire.

Id: [0x0027DCFD]
It was always my intention to convene a moot.

Id: [0x0027DD02]
If I may be so bold, I should like to put my name forward. Under my care, the shire has found some peace this past month.

Id: [0x0027DD03]
Good. My priests will spread word of the moot across the shire. We'll convene in a few days' time.

Id: [0x0027DD1A]
Another swan takes flight. Only I remain, last in a line of … dwindling nobles.

Id: [0x0027DD1D]
The Danes of Grimsby are welcome to put a man forward, but a shiremoot must decide who takes the seat.

Id: [0x0027DD1F]
The shiremoot is a lawful, Godly assembly. Hunwald will be safe, as will you be.

Id: [0x0027DD84]
It now falls to you to break this impasse.

Id: [0x0027DDEB]
Hunwald, no. This shire must be led with courage and heart. Follow in your father's footsteps and lead this shire as he did.

Id: [0x0027DDEF]
Come inside and rest your bumbling bones, love. Be well, Eivor. And thank you.

Id: [0x0027DE15]
Lie down, love. You'll be fine.

Id: [0x0027DE49]
Eivor is right, Hunwald. Tomorrow is a new day.

Id: [0x0027DE4B]
Be well, Eivor. And thank you.

Id: [0x0027DE5B]
Ah, yes, that's right! My orders. Which are … which are what exactly?

Id: [0x0027DE5C]
Well struck, Eivor!

Id: [0x0027DE5F]
A vote for Hunwald will return the house of the ferocious swan to its former glory.

Id: [0x0027DF6A]
To the camp then, and onward to Anecastre! Follow if you will!

Id: [0x0027DF71]
I'm over here.

Id: [0x0027DF73]
All in good time, I imagine.

Id: [0x0027E04E]
When the guards put him in my care, I was told to keep all this a secret … until the appointed time.

Id: [0x0027E04F]
When I asked who gave these orders, they struck me. I wish I could say more.

Id: [0x0027E081]
None here wishes the boy ill, but do what you think necessary.

Id: [0x0027E086]
Even in death, my lord is a friend to all of God's creatures.

Id: [0x0027E08A]
Yes, I thought the same. Troubling.

Id: [0x0027E092]
In my way I was trying to protect him. O Saint Cuthbert, give me strength.

Id: [0x0027E096]
I wasn't put up, Eivor. I felt compelled to carry on for the good of the shire. Until I knew the truth.

Id: [0x0027E099]
Go then. Why linger here?

Id: [0x0027E12B]
Welcome, stranger. Are you here to pay tribute to our Lord Ealdorman?

Id: [0x0027E12C]
I am not sure what to call it, precisely. Words form in my mind, and I give them voice. Often they sound like my dear lord.

Id: [0x0027E12D]
You could try, but he never speaks when others are present.

Id: [0x0027E131]
"Dead" is such a drastic word. I like to think of my lord as … transformed.

Id: [0x0027E135]
Have you need of anything?

Id: [0x0027E143]
Eivor! What news?

Id: [0x0027E146]
No. No, this cannot be! He was strong. A pillar of Lincolnscire. He cannot be gone. He… He…[crying]

Id: [0x0027E15B]
The title's not hereditary, but he can plead his case before a shiremoot. King Ceolwulf must then ratify the decision.

Id: [0x0027E15E]
For once, we find agreement, Eivor.

Id: [0x0027E15F]
With so many like habits, there should be peace between our people and yours. Perhaps that begins now.

Id: [0x0027E162]
I will offer my name as well. My family has ancient ties to this land.

Id: [0x0027E165]
Do visit my estate, Eivor. I have something for you. Something I think you'll enjoy.

Id: [0x0027E178]
The time between my lord's departure and his burial is … longer than usual. My lord must keep up appearances for his upcoming rites.

Id: [0x0027E17D]
Our war-smith has arrived. The fyrds are ready to fight.

Id: [0x0027E17E]
We should attack soon, before the bishop can muster more troops.

Id: [0x0027E17F]
Herefrith, you rat!

Id: [0x0027E183]
Chieftain Eivor. Can we win this fight with the men you see assembled here?

Id: [0x0027E185]
Kill these traitors!

Id: [0x0027E186]
Men of Lincolnscire, stand firm! Defend your ealdorman!

Id: [0x0027E19A]
God knows the love that lives in my heart for the people of Lincolnscire. I pray now that he guides your hand accordingly.

Id: [0x0027E1A6]
We should first bury our dead … no?

Id: [0x0027E1A7]
Agreed.

Id: [0x0027E1AB]
I am at a loss for words. A trusted man of the cloth.

Id: [0x0027E1AC]
I will pray for these martyrs and tend to the remaining wounded until the last man walks free.

Id: [0x0027E1AE]
And you, Eivor. May God or … or the gods … protect you.

Id: [0x0027E1B4]
When songs are sung of the day Lincolnscire was saved, your name will ripple through every stanza.

Id: [0x0027E1C1]
I died the day I hid behind these robes, this cross. To bring the light of my order to a wider view, I debased myself.

Id: [0x0027E1C3]
Clawed my way to the top of this common religion, full of common men.

Id: [0x0027E225]
Are we ready, then?

Id: [0x0027E226]
What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x0027E37F]
Eivor. Is he … is the bishop dead?

Id: [0x0027E3B8]
The shiremoot will soon begin. Will you join us, Eivor? We'd be comforted by your presence.

Id: [0x0027E3EB]
I have assembled a fyrd there. Quite a large one, in fact. They eagerly await your orders, Eivor.

Id: [0x0027E3EC]
An eager fyrd awaits my voice to lead them into battle. Will you ride with us?

Id: [0x0027E3ED]
Never better, I…

Id: [0x0027E402]
Son of our dear and departed Lord Hundbeorht … Lord Hunwald of Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x0027E404]
I miss my father. I'd sooner see him standing here, than … well, I will do my best. For each and every one of you!

Id: [0x0027E409]
But I do need it. The vote is closer than a cat's whisker.

Id: [0x0027E413]
I see the same qualities in his son. Therefore, Hunwald is my man.

Id: [0x0027E415]
I shall rise above the peat moss of mediocrity! Have no fear!

Id: [0x0027E41E]
These Christians are easy to nudge about. So desperate they are to avoid a good fight, they'll agree to most anything a Dane says.

Id: [0x0027E420]
Twelve able lords of Lincolnscire have already cast their stones.

Id: [0x0027E421]
You have earned the trust of our three candidates, it seems. Even our bishop has found a certain fondness for your hardy spirit.

Id: [0x0027E429]
I love the boy, I do. But I fear what would happen if he took his father's title. He's fragile and scattered.

Id: [0x0027E42C]
I didn't tell you sooner because I … I thought by some miracle he had survived.

Id: [0x0027E42F]
But between our troubles in Lincoln and the bandits' raids, we slipped into a pattern of … convenience.

Id: [0x0027E448]
Yes, but they will heal. And stronger than before.

Id: [0x0027E44A]
I shall hold to my friends with every fiber of my constitution and watch my back for iron daggers.

Id: [0x0027E44D]
The din of battle still rings in my ears. I think I now know what it means to be a leader.

Id: [0x0027E44F]
Thank you, my sturdy Norse berserker. The meadhalls of my shire will be lonely without you stomping about.

Id: [0x0027E455]
Blast it, I am a horror with goodbyes.

Id: [0x0027E4A8]
Eivor, you fought as one possessed by a demon today.

Id: [0x0027E4AA]
You have my deepest thanks, Eivor. To you I owe all my future happiness and prosperity.

Id: [0x0027E4B4]
Yes, of course, you did. Forgive me. I'm not yet accustomed to the size of the task before me.

Id: [0x0027E4B9]
Of course. I'd not be the man I am today without this land, these people.

Id: [0x0027E4BE]
Yes, about that…

Id: [0x0027E4C6]
I have found better friends in Danes to be honest. Swanburrow is my love, and you are a better friend to me than any here.

Id: [0x0027E4D0]
DAG

Id: [0x0027E9D4]
[War cry]

Id: [0x0027F4D9]
I'm not here to judge your poems, lord. Speak your purpose or down your mead.

Id: [0x0027F4DA]
You must understand that Eivor has more enemies than friends in Mercia, lord.

Id: [0x0027F4DB]
You must understand that Eivor has more enemies than friends in Mercia, lord.

Before I drag you off by your knob to meet her, I would like to know your name.

Before I drag you off by your knob to meet him, I'd like to know your name.

Id: [0x0027F4DE]
Every warrior in this clan deserves a song or saga, lord. Why Eivor?

Id: [0x0027F4DF]
Every warrior in this clan deserves a song or saga, lord. Why Eivor?

Id: [0x0027F4E2]
What is your name, lord?

Id: [0x0027F4E3]
What's your name, lord?

Id: [0x0027F4E4]
You're talking with her now. And you are…?

Id: [0x0027F4E5]
You're talking with him now. And you are…?

Id: [0x0027F4E6]
Outcast from your family, that is a hard road to walk.

Id: [0x0027F4E7]

Why should we care what happens to your father? Someone will take his place.

Id: [0x0027F4EB]
Why should we care what happens to your father? Someone will take his place.

Id: [0x0027F4EC]
It may be we can help you. But we'll want something in return. An alliance between our clan and yours.

Id: [0x0027F4ED]

Id: [0x0027F4EF]
If I knew my father was ill and beyond saving, I would ready myself to take his place.

You sing a sad song, Hunwald of Lincolnscire. A son robbed of his father's protection, now desperate to prove his honor.

Through Rusland we barreled down the Volga river, raiding as we went, shadowy tribes hurling spears at our ship.

Of course. But it has been so long, he seems a stranger to me. Three winters we are married and he has been away for two.

Id: [0x00283DDC]
Is it done?

Id: [0x00283E11]
Pah! I command Grantebridge! I am master here! And I will scour you rats from this land like rot from a festering wound!

Id: [0x00283E12]
Let me give you some advice, old bear. The surest way to stop a wound from festering isn't with a blade.

Id: [0x00283ECB]
He's made many attempts to unseat me before. This time, he managed the trick.

Id: [0x00283ECC]
Who is this Wigmund? And what does he want?

Who is this Wigmund? And what does he want?

Id: [0x00283EE4]
Thegn Sherwin!

Id: [0x00283EE6]
Confess the many ways in which you betrayed the Lady Eadwyn of Oxenefordscire.

Id: [0x00283EE7]
I confess that you have oat mash for brains and that you couple with sheep!

Id: [0x00283EE8]
Most disgraceful death!

Id: [0x00283EFD]
Eivor of the Raven Clan. I came for you, looking for a friend and ally.

Eivor of the Raven Clan. I came for you, looking for a friend and ally.

Id: [0x00283F00]
The ealdorman, Wigmund, seized it from us. I'm not sure how he managed, but he will not keep it. Not for long.

Id: [0x00283F01]
He has supporters outside the city, but this attack seemed to come from inside the walls. From the heart of Grantebridge.

Id: [0x00283F02]
What happened to Grantebridge?

Id: [0x00283F03]
What happened to Grantebridge?

Id: [0x00283F0E]
Agreed. We'll look for signs of their longboats along the river. And if we are swift, we will find them before the wolves do.

Id: [0x00283F0F]
Let's find your advisors.

Id: [0x00283F10]
Let's find your advisors.

Id: [0x00283F16]
Enough justice for now. We will break for the midday meal!

Id: [0x002840E6]
The thegns that died here were honorable and just. By my faith, I'll raise a fyrd of able men and take revenge on Eadwyn.

Id: [0x002840F8]
Drink…

Id: [0x00284102]
An elixir to loosen your hugr (mind) and unwind your thoughts. You will enter a waking sleep and journey to the world of dreams.

Id: [0x0028416F]
Every single one. They've set out to raise a fyrd of fighting men. They all stand with you, Geadric.

In spite of our efforts, some were killed.

Id: [0x00284964]
We'll need every pike and poker we have to take down Eadwyn.

Id: [0x00284995]
Damn good men, all of 'em. I swear, I'll gut Eadwyn to honor those we lost.

Id: [0x00284E8D]
And you, and your brother, are you still with me?

Id: [0x00284E8F]
Where is your brother and the odd fellow?

Id: [0x00284E90]
I like your bluntness, Geadric. My axe is yours. My brother's too.

Steady, Eivor. It is Valka. I am here.

Id: [0x00284F2D]
There now, my lord. All is prepared. Shall we begin the washing?

Id: [0x00284F75]
Eivor, have you lost hope in my warcraft? I heed Basim's wisdom, but he follows my lead. Always.

Id: [0x00284F90]
Sigurd. Has Basim talked you into something of little reward?

Id: [0x00284F91]
Sigurd. Has Basim talked you into something of little reward?

Id: [0x00284FC6]
Never. Our goal is fixed. We shall soon be the lords of Mercia, then all of England.

Brother, our bond has the iron heft of a war axe.

What are you brewing?

Id: [0x002850CE]
My poor Bjarte. I am so glad he's all right. You saved his life.

Id: [0x002850D0]
You are right. I will wait until he wakes, and when he does, I will belt him.

Id: [0x002850EA]
He should've taken the silver I offered him.

Id: [0x002850F8]
Mmm, yes, yes I would.

Id: [0x002850F9]
No, you are the one with the big nose, not me.[snore]

Id: [0x002850FA]
Enough! You know not to touch me there.

Id: [0x002850FB]
Of course not. No, no, no, I-I'm just resting my eyes, I swear it.

Id: [0x00285102]
(howling)

Id: [0x00285103]
They're here!

Id: [0x0028510D]
That over-hanging branch is a good vantage for a first strike.

Id: [0x0028515D]
Not here. Soma dragged the Saxons east from her longship to tire them out and lose them in the fog.

I'll get it!

I'll get it!

Id: [0x002851AA]
A wolf should be peeled not pampered. It would make a fine coat.

Id: [0x002851AB]
Go see Tyr's new pet. You'll soil your britches!

Id: [0x002851B8]
I know your mind, Havi, but this wolf is not your enemy. The signs of Ragnarok, when it comes, will be clear for all to see.

Id: [0x002851D3]
You spoke with the Builder? You saw his work?

Id: [0x002851D4]
And the sacred water, was it put to use?

Id: [0x002851D8]
It was.

Id: [0x002851D9]
It was.

Id: [0x002851DA]
Indeed.

Id: [0x002851DB]
Indeed.

Id: [0x002851DF]
But your expression says otherwise.

Id: [0x002851E1]
Me?

Id: [0x002851E2]
Does he take us for slavers? I will smash his skull 'til he shits out brains!

Id: [0x002851E3]
Now, hold on. Everyone. Let's weigh the--

Id: [0x002851E4]
What was your reply?

Id: [0x00285219]
I fear the price is too high.

Id: [0x0028521A]
I fear the price is too high.

The size of that beast! A worthy hunt!

The final blow is mine.

The final blow is mine.

Id: [0x0028523E]

All threads are measured. Everything dies. Even ancient Ymir, whose fertile carcass gave birth to the nine worlds.

Not all can be foreseen, but loose threads can be rewoven or restrung. At day's end, the tapestry will be preserved.

Sounds right. The Saxon called Wigmund is one of them. He robbed me of my city, forced us into these swamps.

Id: [0x00285315]
He's a flailing ealdorman under the old king. A bitter man digging his fingernails into Grantebridge, just to say he can.

Id: [0x0028532D]
We sailed to Rome, then Africa. Past oceans of sand, warriors of all colors, and beauty the eyes must weep to behold.

And now, I have returned! With riches and glory to share with my family, my friends, my ice-forged drengir!

Id: [0x002853AA]
Fulke is a curator of objects of great worth. One of which may reveal my true nature.

Id: [0x002853AB]
To know that I am descended from the ancient gods is a victory. It would give me dominion over this land.

Id: [0x002853B3]
Enough of these mysteries, Sigurd.

What have we to talk about? You have nothing I need. Worth by birth, heathen. I was born a noble. You were plucked from a giant's armpit!

I built this town! From a mud hut to a thriving port. And we both know you'll bleed those riches dry without my guiding hand.

Leave! Go die in the muck where you belong, heathens!

Id: [0x0028607E]
The wounds on these bodies weep like little eyes. Should we hide them? Fresh kills will arouse suspicion.

Id: [0x00286085]
We will rebuild. We'll strengthen the walls, reunite families … and likely use less wood, more stone.

Id: [0x00286086]
Ill-timed, Erke. I'd like a quiet moment to pray.

Id: [0x00286087]
We'll take it together.

Id: [0x0028608A]
You came to Lunden in search of a friend, Eivor. You found two.

Id: [0x0028608B]
Aye, Broga. And you deserve this.

Id: [0x0028609C]
What does it say, Sigurd? Does it speak to you?

Id: [0x0028609E]
And the ash tree! I see the great Tree of Life. Her boughs reaching … skyward … opening the way.

Id: [0x0028611E]
You always said we needed more warriors to fight Kjotve. And for warriors, we need wealth, which Sigurd has brought us.

Id: [0x0028611F]
You always said we needed more warriors to fight Kjotve. And for warriors, we need wealth, which Sigurd has brought us.

Id: [0x0028621F]
I … I have seen this somewhere. I know these words. I…

Id: [0x00286222]
One who stands at a threshold should take great care to look around…

Id: [0x002863A9]
Wonderful. As it blends with my paint, its magic will power the runes of protection that I here inscribe.

Id: [0x002863AE]
Harnessing hugr (mind) magic to bind my spirit to these enchantments. It amplifies the strength.

Id: [0x002863B0]
They practice a form of hugr magic, but this is my own technique. And it's just … about … done.

Id: [0x002863B5]
As promised.

Id: [0x002863B6]
As promised.

Id: [0x002863B7]
Wait! What are you doing?

Id: [0x002863B8]
Wait! What are you doing?

Id: [0x002863B9]
Hugr magic? You learned this from the Jotnar?

Id: [0x002863BA]
Hugr magic? You learned this from the Jotnar?

Id: [0x002863CB]
They did. And if all goes well, it will protect your allies and roast your enemies.

Id: [0x002863CC]
With pleasure. Draw some invaders out from the woods and into the shield. Alive, of course. They must be alive.

Id: [0x002863CE]
You have my word, Havi.

Id: [0x002863D0]
It will indeed! Hold … hold …

Id: [0x002863D1]
…And there it is! A thing of beauty!

Id: [0x002863EB]
Step lightly my friend. Those are fragile.

Id: [0x002863ED]
Show me.

Id: [0x002863EE]
Show me.

Id: [0x002863F3]
Try a gentler touch, would you?

Id: [0x002864CE]
Eivor. I am more than I appear to be. So much more.

Id: [0x002864D1]
A parlay, then. We must call a parlay.

Id: [0x002864D6]
Erke! Help me with this!

Id: [0x002864D7]
I'm trying! It's blocked!

Id: [0x002864D9]
(coughing)

Id: [0x002864DA]
Eivor, make for the steeple!

Id: [0x00286503]
I'd be quick about plundering. King Aelfred'll be on his way, and he won't be alone.

Id: [0x00286513]
You've felled the lofty lady!

Id: [0x00286514]
Do what you must, Thegn of Dungheaps. As one loyal to her shire and her people, I know which of us God favors.

Id: [0x00286515]
Eivor bested you. It's for Eivor to decide your fate.

Id: [0x0028651B]
Heal her wounds, dress her in rags, and send her out onto the heath in exile.

Id: [0x0028651C]
Heal her wounds, dress her in rags, and send her out onto the heath in exile.

Id: [0x0028651F]
You fought with honor and purpose. For that I put you in Geadric's care. He will see you're treated well.

Id: [0x00286520]
You fought with honor and purpose. For that I put you in Geadric's care. He will see you're treated well.

Id: [0x00286521]
I will walk the roads until my feet are bloody, dreaming of cutting out your rotten lungs.

Id: [0x00286522]
Agreed.

Id: [0x00286523]
Take her away.

Id: [0x00286526]
Aye, you've done us well, Eivor. I thank ye. And if ever you need the like, I'll do what I can.

Id: [0x00286533]
Over here, you stinking shits! Skulking about like cowards!

Id: [0x00286534]
Over here, you stinking shits! Skulking about like cowards!

Id: [0x00286537]
Am I so fearsome that you hide like mice in a farmer's field?

Id: [0x00286538]
Am I so fearsome that you hide like mice in a farmer's field?

Id: [0x00286539]
That's good! Draw them closer!

Id: [0x00286546]
They're blocked inside!

Id: [0x00286547]
Let them burn!

Id: [0x00286549]
Kill them all!

Id: [0x00286558]
Yes, yes! It works!

Id: [0x0028655D]
The shield is unstable!

Id: [0x0028655E]
Come back inside while you still can!

Id: [0x00286561]
No! Not at all! I just need to make some adjustments.

Id: [0x00286566]
What now, Builder? Your shield has failed.

Id: [0x00286567]
What now, Builder? Your shield has failed.

Id: [0x00286568]
Look at that! Like moths to a flame!

Id: [0x00286569]
Look at that! Like moths to a flame!

Id: [0x00286570]
Ah! It burns!

Id: [0x00286571]
Ah! It burns!

Id: [0x0028657A]
I should have let Loki have his way with you.

Id: [0x0028657B]
I should have let Loki have his way with you.

Id: [0x0028657C]
Come, you fatherless curs! I am one, and you are many. What have you got to lose?

Id: [0x0028657D]
Come, you fatherless curs! I am one, and you are many. What have you got to lose?

Id: [0x00286580]
Builder! Is your shield supposed to flicker like that?

Id: [0x00286581]
Builder! Is your shield supposed to flicker like that?

Id: [0x00286588]
The runes you painted conjured this shield?

Id: [0x00286589]
The runes you painted conjured this shield?

Id: [0x0028658A]
The barrier will not harm me as I cross?

Id: [0x0028658B]
The barrier will not harm me as I cross?

Id: [0x0028658C]
There. Will that do?

Id: [0x0028658D]
There. Will that do?

Id: [0x002865B6]
Forget the pain, Cearl. Shake it off!

Id: [0x002865B7]
Rip a lung out!

Id: [0x002865B8]
God save us all!

Id: [0x002865B9]
I bleedin' love a good toss-around. Gives me life!

Id: [0x002865BB]
I'll vomit on you, Dane! Won't think twice about it!

Id: [0x002865C2]
Whatever happens, whatever I see, whatever you foretell, it must stay between us.

Id: [0x002865C3]
Whatever happens, whatever I see, whatever you foretell, it must stay between us.

Id: [0x002866A2]
We cannot change the fate we are bound to. What matter who knows and who does not? The outcome will be the same.

Id: [0x00286800]
We could have cut you to bloody giblets, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x0028681B]
If I had announced my desire from the start, you would have hurled me back through that portal.

Id: [0x0028681D]
But my offer is honest, and my magic is real. For a wife and a queen, I will give you the means to protect your kind.

Id: [0x00286822]
Don't fear, my friend. The problem is no more. I have mixed the proper solution.

Id: [0x00286824]
O, just a trifle, nothing grand. I only want Freyja as my wife and queen.

Id: [0x00286913]
It worked well enough. Impressive but unstable.

Id: [0x00286914]
It worked well enough. Impressive but unstable.

Id: [0x00286916]
Materials we can find, that's no issue. What incentive do you mean?

Id: [0x00286918]
I don't haggle like a common fishmonger, Havi. I desire Freyja, with all my heart.

Id: [0x0028691A]
So ask yourself … is one marriage a fair exchange for the salvation of Asgard and its people?

Id: [0x0028691C]
Nothing so bold! I would be happy to simply bask in her beauty. She can govern the realm however she sees fit.

Id: [0x00286921]
Freyja is not mine to barter like a bale of wheat. I will ask her what she desires.

Id: [0x00286922]
Freyja is not mine to barter like a bale of wheat. I will ask her what she desires.

Id: [0x00286923]
Your coming here was no accident, was it? You desired Freyja well before you arrived.

Id: [0x00286924]
Your coming here was no accident, was it? You desired Freyja well before you arrived.

Id: [0x00286927]
Why the Queen of Asgard? Is it your intent to rule at her side?

Id: [0x00286928]
Why the Queen of Asgard? Is it your intent to rule at her side?

Id: [0x0028692B]
You name an impossible price, Builder. Is that your trick? Aim high to land somewhere in the center?

Id: [0x0028692C]
You name an impossible price, Builder. Is that your trick? Aim high to land somewhere in the center?

Id: [0x00286933]
Materials we can find, that's no issue. What incentive do you mean?

Id: [0x0028695A]
You may think this odd, but our lively chatter here has inspired in me a short poem. May I recite it for you?

Id: [0x00286964]
Ahlan wa sahlan, Eivor.

Id: [0x0028696A]
From what we know, Aelfred is a fearsome king. If Eadwyn can win his full support, this shire is lost to Wessex.

Id: [0x00286A78]
Describe it for me.

Id: [0x00286A99]
Could you lend a hand and bring me a few jars of paint? As many as you can.

Id: [0x00286A9A]
Move the jars near me. And be careful.

Id: [0x00286A9B]
Be careful with that jar, it's fragile.

Id: [0x00286A9C]
Easy…

Id: [0x00286AA2]
Well done. You've smashed all my jars. Now, take a break and climb up on that rock.

Id: [0x00286AB2]
Warriors! Drengir! When I was away, far from these frozen shores, wondering if I should ever see home again, I grew afraid.

Id: [0x00286AB4]
Supply wagons. We should destroy them.

Id: [0x00286B37]
This way! The docks are burning!

Id: [0x00286B38]
Take this path. You'll avoid most attention.

Id: [0x00286B39]
I'll give you cover when I can.

Id: [0x00286B3B]
Let's turn these springalds back on The Compass.

Id: [0x00286B7C]
Hello, Eivor.

Id: [0x00286B83]
Avgos and Frideswid were too confident. I don't suffer the same disease.

Id: [0x00286B84]
I'll drown and burn every last man, woman, and child in this shithole city.

Id: [0x00286B87]
You three spin our destinies as a thread in fabric. But threads may be unraveled by snags and catches.

We suffered no losses in this fight, and the men who humiliated us are dead. What is there to say?

Id: [0x00286BAF]
We suffered no losses in this fight, and the men who humiliated us are dead. What is there to say?

Id: [0x00286BB0]
This land will never prosper while clan battles clan.

Id: [0x00286BB1]
Eivor. Looking rough, you are. Welcome home.

Id: [0x00286C0F]
Cut us loose. Hurry!

Id: [0x00286C12]
You have a brusque way of ending an argument.

Id: [0x00286C2F]
Today we seize Nottfall from Kjotve! Tonight his heart will pulse with worry, tomorrow it will burst from fear!

Id: [0x00286C44]
But here I am, home in time to join those I have missed, those I love, in this glorious fight!

Id: [0x00286C49]
Are you sent by the angels of Saklas? Or the Self-Begotten One above?

Id: [0x00286C51]
You know these isles best, Wolf-Kissed. Lead us to victory.

Id: [0x00286CEE]
You. Always questioning, second guessing my wishes. You slowed us down and I missed my chance!

Id: [0x00286CFB]
It's a stone, Sigurd! You're chasing shadows, like a madman howling at the moon.

Id: [0x00286CFC]
It's a stone, Sigurd! You're chasing shadows, like a madman howling at the moon.

Id: [0x00286D05]
This was my victory. To know my true self. My destiny! My--

Id: [0x00286D08]
Patience, Brother. We will find this stone wherever it is. Right or wrong, you will have your answer.

Id: [0x00286D09]
Patience, Brother. We will find this stone wherever it is. Right or wrong, you will have your answer.

Id: [0x00286D0C]
Basim fills your head with twisted prophecies. He leads you like a chained dog.

Id: [0x00286D0D]
Basim fills your head with twisted prophecies. He leads you like a chained dog.

Id: [0x00286D0E]
I know the answer already, Eivor. I have seen it in my dreams. I know exactly--

Id: [0x00286D0F]
Basim has shown me so much! He knows my mind, he--

Id: [0x00286FB1]
May we see these objects?

Id: [0x00286FE3]
Smells of burnt peat.

Id: [0x00286FE4]
Smells of burnt peat.

Id: [0x00286FE8]
The guilty have come for spoils.

Id: [0x00286FE9]
Was our dignity not enough? You return again to mock our family? To make light of my father's sacrifice?

Id: [0x00286FEE]
What battle spit you out?

Id: [0x00286FEF]
What battle spit you out?

Id: [0x00286FF0]
You dare intrude? You will be skinned like the others.

Id: [0x00286FF1]
I will tear you apart.

Id: [0x00286FF4]
Let rest the spirit that haunts you.

Id: [0x00286FF5]
Let rest the spirit that haunts you.

Id: [0x002870EE]
Come.

Id: [0x002870F2]
Not true!

Id: [0x002870F3]
Silence!

Id: [0x002870F4]
Each shall be called to confess his perfidy.

Id: [0x002870F6]
These subjects of the Lady Eadwyn have betrayed their oaths to the shire…

Id: [0x002870F8]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x0028712F]
Have I wronged you? I am here only for the wedding. Where I come from, we do not poison the well of friendship so swiftly.

Id: [0x00287130]
Have I wronged you? I am here only for the wedding. Where I come from, we do not poison the well of friendship so swiftly.

Id: [0x0028718E]
I have come upon these ancient timbers, tarred for preservation, to mark my sacred symbol and pinpoint the source of their power.

Id: [0x0028728A]
We accept.

Id: [0x0028728B]
Done.

Id: [0x002872AD]
In all my time in Grantebridge, this tunnel was my most careful project. The best kept secret in the city.

Id: [0x002872B1]
The only people who knew about this tunnel were me and the three in my inner circle.

Id: [0x002872D8]
Eivor, destroy those wagons.

Id: [0x002872D9]
Let the flames have them!

Id: [0x00287379]
Has your mind fled you? You act as though possessed by the spirit of another!

Id: [0x002873DD]
Did you reach the summit of this mountain?

Id: [0x00287425]
Whatever mind drives you, Havi, you mustn't kill here. Shed no innocent blood in this sacred place.

Id: [0x00287427]
I am the Many in the One, Tyr. The Yeller, the Spear Charger, the Masked One. I am Long Beard and Shaggy cloak.

Id: [0x00287464]
My mind is my own, Tyr. But you pose a curious thought. Could one mind usurp another's? The hugr (mind) of one in the body of someone else?

Id: [0x00287467]
My mind is my own, Tyr. But you pose a curious thought. Could one mind usurp another's? The hugr (mind) of one in the body of someone else?

Id: [0x0028746A]
Take this beast, I want it caged. I would have every wolf and dog in Asgard caged if I could.

Id: [0x00287471]
I am the Many in the One, Tyr. The Yeller, the Spear Charger, the Masked One. I am Long Beard and Shaggy cloak.

Id: [0x00287481]
Are you drunk on these waters? Take your flask, forget the wolf, and let us be gone before the Nornir weave us a pair of shackles!

Id: [0x00287486]
Will you slay every wolf in the nine realms to sidestep this fate? Ridiculous!

Id: [0x00287488]
The Nornir warned me … a wolf will be my doom at Ragnarok.

Id: [0x00287489]
The Nornir warned me … a wolf will be my doom at Ragnarok.

Id: [0x0028748C]
To ease your troubled mind, I will do as you ask. We need you focused for the coming war.

Id: [0x00287493]
The stone is within our grasp.

Id: [0x00287498]
Ah, yes. Good. A wise decision, Havi.

Id: [0x00287499]
The wolf lives. But Tyr will cage the beast at his hall. I want no free wolves in Asgard.

Id: [0x0028749A]
The wolf lives. But Tyr will cage the beast at his hall. I want no free wolves in Asgard.

Id: [0x0028749C]
O, what have you done? What have you done!

Id: [0x0028749D]
It should never have been born into this world.

Id: [0x0028749E]
It should never have been born into this world.

Id: [0x002874A1]
Ah, yes. To be sure, intellect should overrule our instinct. Tyr knows this well.

Id: [0x002874A2]
Tyr convinced me to spare it, against my better instincts.

Id: [0x002874A3]
Tyr convinced me to spare it, against my better instincts.

Id: [0x002874A5]
The wolf, Mad One! What have you done to the wolf!

Id: [0x002874A6]
I asked you a question, Loki. Is the Builder ready or not?

Id: [0x002874A7]
I asked you a question, Loki. Is the Builder ready or not?

Id: [0x002874A9]
In a meadow not far from here. Your raven may find the way.

Id: [0x002874AA]
Now tell me plainly. Where is the Builder?

Id: [0x002874AB]
Now tell me plainly. Where is the Builder?

Id: [0x002874BB]
Be on your guard, someone is watching us.

Id: [0x002874BE]
Take care, everyone.

Id: [0x002874BF]
Eadwyn's eyes and ears, no doubt.

Id: [0x002874CD]
How did the well look? Peaceful? Calm? Quiet?

Id: [0x002874CF]
Driving at? I'm only curious. The well is a wondrous place, I wish I could see it for myself.

Id: [0x002874D0]
I have a skin of sacred water, yes. Is the Builder preparing his demonstration?

Id: [0x002874D1]
I have a skin of sacred water, yes. Is the Builder preparing his demonstration?

Id: [0x002874D4]
As I pray, the Lord sends through me the voice of a Holy Spirit. It reverberates with the finery of ancient language, and I am made anew.

Id: [0x002874E2]
Take position on that bluff and watch for the soldiers, would you?

Id: [0x002874E3]
Take position on that bluff and watch for the soldiers, would you?

Id: [0x002874E5]
If you must know, the little brat went off hunting boar some time ago.

Id: [0x002874E7]
He went south. That's all I know. Probably followed the stream here south to the forest.

Id: [0x002874F1]
Go to your god, boy. And I will sing for you in Valhalla.

Id: [0x00287501]
You'll hear me howl as the men approach.

Id: [0x00287899]
Some of the missing we find again in several places, cut to pieces.

Id: [0x0028789A]
Good Lord, Erke.

Id: [0x002878C8]
You know my demands. Until my brother Gwriad walks free, peace between us is impossible.

Id: [0x002878C9]
He is lucky he can walk at all! Fell on his own blade fleeing from us!

Id: [0x002878CA]
First, my brother.

Id: [0x002878CB]
Enough! This is a house of God! Let us take some few minutes to gather ourselves, shall we? Eivor, to me.

Id: [0x002878D4]
We've been at war with the Britons for coming on two years.

Id: [0x002878D7]
The Britons had the best of it, 'til me and my berserkers plowed through their ranks and chased Rhodri's brother into a ditch.

Id: [0x002878FF]
Lock the doors. Murder that sweating pig and have done with it.

Id: [0x00287929]
Talk, talk, talk! All we do is talk!

Id: [0x0028792A]
We should settle this with blood, not pretty words.

Id: [0x0028792B]
Ahh! Enough of this nonsense!

Id: [0x00287947]
Good God, what carnage. We must let Bishop Deorlaf know that the battle is done.

Id: [0x0028794A]
Have you made progress, my friend?

Id: [0x0028798A]
We will stay behind and draw runes in the dirt. But do not take long, my blood is up.

Id: [0x0028798D]
Enough! I will have blood!

Id: [0x00287990]
Thor thunders beside us!

Id: [0x002879D6]
Eivor! Do the thegns live?

Id: [0x002879E2]
Nottfall lies in ruin! Let the blood and ash be a warning!

Id: [0x00287A35]
Where did they come from?

Id: [0x00287A36]
Find somewhere to hide!

Id: [0x00287A37]
Find somewhere to hide!

Id: [0x00287A66]
Lord, we thank thee for Your protection--

Id: [0x00287ADA]
What has your poison done?

Id: [0x00287ADB]
What has your poison done?

Id: [0x00287ADD]
Which of the traitor kings sent you? Was it Edmund? Burgred? Aella?

Id: [0x00287ADF]
I follow the orders of no king. Nor will I bow to you.

Id: [0x00287AE0]
I follow the orders of no king. Nor will I bow to you.

Id: [0x00287B48]
King Harald, may I speak?

Id: [0x00287B49]
The floor is yours, King Styrbjorn.

Id: [0x00287B4A]
My people have held our land since the days when Odin himself walked among us.

Id: [0x00287B4C]
My kingdom is humble, but we have paid for it in blood. Our victory over Kjotve is proof that we will not lay down without a fight.

Id: [0x00287B4E]
All here have buried friends, brothers, and sisters … sons and daughters. And I for one have had my fill of death.

Id: [0x00287B51]
I take no offense, Styrbjorn Jarl. And I thank you for your fealty.

Id: [0x00287B6D]
It's not safe here.

Id: [0x00287B6E]
It's not safe here.

Id: [0x00287B8A]
And Eivor? I owe you a drink at least, later, if you'd have one. Find me at the festivities.

Id: [0x00287B90]
(unintelligible)[Odd. That path is usually safe. Are you injured?]

Id: [0x00287B92]
Escorted Tewdwr to the shrine of some Christian saint. Our path was not peaceful. Accosted by a group of boars.

Id: [0x00287B93]
Escorted Tewdwr to the shrine of some Christian saint. Our path was not peaceful. Accosted by a singular of boars.

Id: [0x00287B99]
I kept my word to Cynon, and that spatchcock Tewdwr lives.

Id: [0x00287B9A]
I kept my word to Cynon, and that spatchcock Tewdwr lives.

Id: [0x00287B9D]
How did Tewdwr become Cynon's successor? He speaks with his God's fire, but I do not quite believe it.

Id: [0x00287B9E]
How did Tewdwr become Cynon's successor? He speaks with his God's fire, but I do not quite believe it.

Id: [0x00287B9F]
Hm. Tragic that is. I think the lad can still be molded, Eivor. You might be just the one to do that.

Id: [0x00287BA6]
Glowecestre gives their glut to otherworldly visitors. And, if you dress as one, you'll get that bounty yourself.

Id: [0x00287BA8]
Light it up and burn it down! Burn it all down!

Id: [0x00287BCF]
I will, so long as you recant your friendship with that pot of warm piss, King Aelfred.

Id: [0x00287CFA]
Ahh! You must be Eivor? Tewdwr, I see you've welcomed our honored guest! Come just in time for my last Samhain!

Id: [0x00287CFB]
At your behest, we welcome all pagans set upon God's own Glowecestre.

Id: [0x00287CFE]
Tewdwr, as your Harvest King, I demand that you remove the turnip from your arse and be merry.

Id: [0x00287D01]
Cynon! I do not need a heathen escort!

Id: [0x00287D04]
What happened here? This doesn't look good.

Id: [0x00287D05]
What happened here? This doesn't look good.

Id: [0x00287D13]
Hel's breath. What happened last night?

Id: [0x00287D14]
Hel's breath. What happened last night?

Id: [0x00287D17]
Haha! You heard the woman, give her something stronger!

Id: [0x00287D21]
It's nothing.

Id: [0x00287D23]
(unintelligible)[You're lucky Modron's around to patch this up.]

Id: [0x00287D25]
Careful with the old man, he's had many winters worth of wounds.

Id: [0x00287D26]
Careful with the old man, he's had many winters worth of wounds.

Id: [0x00287D4E]
Eivor, Eivor, put the hood on!

Id: [0x00287D52]
This way, this way, look out for … the Black Sow.

Id: [0x00287D5E]
You're well met. Gwilim here has challenged my honor in a contest of drinks.

Id: [0x00287D61]
Count on it.

Id: [0x00287D62]
And I'll make for the quays. There's another few bodies there to fish out of the muck.

Id: [0x00287D68]
Well … for food and supplies, they stockpile cargo at Wenlocan Outpost, down south of Quatford.

Id: [0x00287D70]
Give me a cup!

Id: [0x00287D71]
Give me a cup!

Id: [0x00287D74]
Perhaps later, Tewdwr. I will find you again and defend my honor in ale.

Id: [0x00287D75]
Perhaps later, Tewdwr. I will find you again and defend my honor in ale.

Id: [0x00287D7A]
Ready for that drink, Eivor? But fair warning, my reputation will not suffer another blow.

Id: [0x002881A4]
So what is your plan?

Id: [0x002881A5]
So what is your plan?

Id: [0x00288264]
I want to go in quietly. No point in bringing every armed Briton down on our heads.

Id: [0x00288265]
I want to go in quietly. No point in bringing every armed Briton down on our heads.

Id: [0x00288266]
Bloody kindling it is! We will smash this place to splinters!

Id: [0x00288267]
Bloody kindling it is! We will smash this place to splinters!

Id: [0x002882BA]
I'm no philosopher, but by my lights, a fellow who gives himself o'er as hostage has as much sense as a pile of bear droppings.

Id: [0x00288407]
Shush!

Id: [0x0028840C]
I've rallied some of my soldiers, but my three advisors are missing. If we hope to retake Grantebridge, I'll need them at my side.

Id: [0x0028840E]
They are my best, my inner circle: Birna, Galinn, Lif. We may as well be of the same blood.

Id: [0x0028840F]
Tell me about them.

Id: [0x00288410]
Tell me about them.

Id: [0x0028841C]
This'll work faster than any tonic.

Id: [0x00288421]
Good! Give me visions of all creatures that roam these hills, and a sore head tomorrow to pay for it!

Id: [0x00288422]
Good! Give me visions of all creatures that roam these hills, and a sore head tomorrow to pay for it!

Id: [0x00288425]
Some ale, then!

Id: [0x0028842D]
Ugh, that tastes awful. It feels good, though.

Id: [0x00288431]
Flaming pig. Chases you home at night. [Ono: burps]Silly words to scare silly children.

Id: [0x00288433]
Perhaps I judge too much … truths I half-believe. Foolishness sometimes takes my tongue.

Id: [0x00288434]
Sow? Like pig?

Id: [0x00288435]
Sow? Like pig?

Id: [0x00288436]
Pfff… you see magic as the stuff of children's dreams?

Id: [0x00288437]
Pfff… you see magic as the stuff of children's dreams?

Id: [0x0028843A]
[Ono: laughs]A great blackness chases stars across the sky in great whorls of color and light. Whooosh!

Id: [0x0028843B]
[Ono: laughs]A great blackness chases stars across the sky in great whorls of color and light. Whooosh!

Id: [0x0028843C]
Shhh! People are sleeping! More ale to seal our friendship!

Id: [0x0028843D]
Here we are. Right inside here.

Id: [0x0028844D]
That's enough to go on. Thank you.

Id: [0x0028844E]
That's enough to go on. Thank you.

Id: [0x00288469]
I ain't the Church! Name's Gwilim, and I turned to God just three years back.

Id: [0x0028846B]
I thought the Church condemned this celebration?

Id: [0x0028846C]
I thought the Church condemned this celebration?

Id: [0x00288470]
Ha! Ale is known to blunt even the sharpest of blades, Eivor.

Id: [0x00288471]
Gwilim, the warrior-monk. Now we can match wills with a flagon in hand.

Id: [0x00288472]
Gwilim, the warrior-monk. Now we can match wills with a flagon in hand.

Id: [0x00288474]
Not every tonsured man is a wet-eared abbey babe. I came to God after I had scarred my soul with sin.

Id: [0x00288475]
For a shaveling of the Christ Lord, you have a lot of scars, Gwilim.

Id: [0x00288476]
For a shaveling of the Christ Lord, you have a lot of scars, Gwilim.

Id: [0x00288499]
Blood. Ceolbert's? Or an animal he felled?

Id: [0x0028849A]
Blood. Ceolbert's? Or an animal he felled?

Id: [0x0028849F]
Paw prints and blood. Not from a boar. A wolf, dragging something through the dirt.

Id: [0x002884A0]
Paw prints and blood. Not from a boar. A wolf, dragging something through the dirt.

Id: [0x00288531]
Merciless wench.

Id: [0x00288532]
Merciless wench.

Id: [0x00288533]
If I take you, I will be closer.

Id: [0x00288534]
You will not infect me!

Id: [0x00288535]
A lucky strike.

Id: [0x00288536]
But now I hold nothing back. If I must take your eyes, I will.

Id: [0x0028858B]
This was no wolf. Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x0028858F]
The Britons did this. I found this blade in his chest.

Id: [0x00288590]
The Britons did this. I found this blade in his chest.

Id: [0x00288598]
Your war is back on.

Id: [0x00288599]
Your war is back on.

Id: [0x0028859B]
I know you owe me less than nothing, but please, take care of them.

Id: [0x00288717]
Eivor! Are you not done? Have you stopped to nap?

Id: [0x0028872A]
Wha … what? What's happening?

Id: [0x00288730]
What business have you with a backwater king, anyway?

Id: [0x00288758]
Oswald of Elmenham. He was King Edmund's counsel before the invasions. And like it or not, he's the last Saxon noble with any sway.

Id: [0x002887A5]
This war must end, that is my first concern. The time to strike is--

Id: [0x002887A7]
Is when I say we strike. Halfdan's hammer protects this land.

Id: [0x002887AF]
As you wish, my lord.

Id: [0x002887B7]
And you are the Hero of Jorvik, so sing my skalds.

Id: [0x0028882E]
Twenty years I have been your ealdorman. Now these old bones are ready for my last duty.

Id: [0x00288837]
There is another hamlet still loyal to Wigmund. Further ahead, come.

Id: [0x0028883A]
Don't play me for a fool, Ubba. I know Burgred's sent a weregeld your way.

Id: [0x00288841]
Repton. Sigurd should be here with the Ragnarssons.

Id: [0x00288842]
Repton. Sigurd should be here with the Ragnarssons.

Id: [0x00288847]
I can see that, fool! What do we do about them!

Id: [0x00288848]
Is that you, Leofrith? How quickly you recover. I'm beginning to wonder if it is a man or a god beneath all that armor.

Id: [0x0028884E]
Let's go. It's time to capture a kingdom.

Id: [0x0028884F]
Let's go. It's time to capture a kingdom.

Id: [0x00288850]
I'm not yet ready.

Id: [0x00288851]
I'm not yet ready.

Id: [0x00288860]
I am honored to be your Harvest King. With this flame set, may our crops be plentiful and our winters brief!

Id: [0x002888B2]
Become the Mari Lwyd, the spirit who sings for cake and ale! And you cannot have your cloak back until we leave.

Id: [0x002888B6]
I'll keep this covering, but even a knife to my throat could not make me sing on command.

Id: [0x002888B7]
I'll keep this covering, but even a knife to my throat could not make me sing on command.

Id: [0x002888BA]
That house for sure.

Id: [0x002888E9]
[laugh]Alright, alright, you did cause a fright. Take a sweet reward.

Id: [0x002888ED]
Gunnar, if no one else is dressed this way, I will fill your shop with sheep.

Id: [0x002888EE]
Gunnar, if no one else is dressed this way, I will fill your shop with sheep.

Id: [0x0028893A]
Haggling over silver is a bad look for the son of Ragnar Lothbrok. But worry not, Ubba, I have the warriors you need.

Id: [0x00288948]
It's not a role I begged for, but it's what Mercia needs just now. A man to fairly rule both Saxons and Danes.

Id: [0x00288961]
One day, I hope. As it stands, we at least have an understanding.

Id: [0x00288962]
Do you have what it takes to be king?

Id: [0x00288963]
Do you have what it takes to be king?

Id: [0x00288965]
I am doing my part. I hope you have come to do yours. We are going to need all the help we can get for what comes next.

Id: [0x00288966]
It sounds like you'll be a king in name only. A puppet.

Id: [0x00288967]
It sounds like you'll be a king in name only. A puppet.

Id: [0x00288969]
Burgred is furious, of course. But this is our new reality. And I won't sit idly while he drags our kingdom through the dirt.

Id: [0x0028896A]
I can't imagine the current king is too happy about all this.

Id: [0x0028896B]
I can't imagine the current king is too happy about all this.

Id: [0x00288978]
The king has refused our offers of peace. Ceolwulf means to change that. He'll be a new king for a new England.

Id: [0x00288979]
For now, Burgred is holed up in his fortress at Tamworth, making a final stand.

Id: [0x0028897A]
Another shithole, only further south.

Id: [0x0028897B]
We've held a siege there for weeks, to no effect. So no more knocking. Now we batter the gate to splinters.

Id: [0x0028897C]
Yes, remove. I cannot stress that enough. Burgred is not to be harmed. My legitimacy as king hangs on this one simple fact.

Id: [0x0028897D]
[sigh]You rob all the joy from war, Saxon.

Id: [0x00288983]
His request is fair, Ivarr. And we will honor it.

Id: [0x0028898A]
How can I answer that with any hope that you'd believe me? I only want what is best for the people of Mercia.

Id: [0x0028898D]
Ceolwulf betrayed his present king. Maybe tomorrow he betrays us too. Why trust him?

Id: [0x0028898E]
Ceolwulf betrayed his present king. Maybe tomorrow he betrays us too. Why trust him?

Id: [0x002889A8]
Ceolwulf is right to be cautious. If he shows mercy to Burgred, the people will have reason to trust him.

Id: [0x002889A9]
Ceolwulf is right to be cautious. If he shows mercy to Burgred, the people will have reason to trust him.

Id: [0x002889AA]
My thinking exactly. And the quicker we act, the more lives we spare … on both sides.

Id: [0x002889BA]
This is a good plan, Brother. I am ready for the coming fight.

Id: [0x002889BB]
This is a good plan, Brother. I am ready for the coming fight.

Id: [0x002889C0]
A sorry tale. Did you learn anything from Halewyn?

Id: [0x002889C6]
He gave some herbs to a man from Cudd Lladron. Name of Gwilim, he was drinking with Tewdwr and myself.

Id: [0x002889C7]
He gave some herbs to a man from Cudd Lladron. Name of Gwilim, he was drinking with Tewdwr and myself.

Id: [0x002889CC]
Little boy, little boy. Where is your daddy hiding?

Id: [0x002889CD]
Godless heathens. Grantebridge is the province of Lord Wigmund of Walden. The city is rightfully his.

Id: [0x002889D1]
Cudd Lladron is the Welsh name for the Thieves' Warren. It's atop a hill west of here. I can lead you.

Id: [0x002889D3]
Tewdwr's fate is to my interest as well. This is a troubling development that I hope to get to the bottom of.

Id: [0x002889D4]
I owe you a great deal for all your aid. You did not have to trust me.

Id: [0x002889D5]
I owe you a great deal for all your aid. You did not have to trust me.

Id: [0x002889D8]
Hiding among the church mice. I'll need to plan our attack.

Id: [0x002889DB]
Did you find enough clues around Grantebridgescire? Are you ready to choose the traitor?

Id: [0x002889F1]
As a leader must…

Id: [0x002889F2]
Lif. You have betrayed me, Lif.

Id: [0x002889F3]
Birna. You betrayed me.

Id: [0x002889F4]
Galinn. You have betrayed me, Galinn.

Id: [0x00288A50]
Where did he find that beast?

Id: [0x00288A51]
He took the wolf as a trophy. That's the story I heard.

Id: [0x00288A52]
I'll wager Tyr is raising that wolf so he can fight it!

Id: [0x00288AB4]
I need to piss.

Id: [0x00288AB8]
Take in the sights of Repton if you like. We will be at the docks when you're ready to go.

Id: [0x00288ABF]
I'm not going anywhere, bacraut (asshole). You have the king on his heels because of me! Because of my men!

Id: [0x00288AC0]
If I wanted to hear you talk shit, I'd gouge out your tongue and shove it up your ass. Now, fuck off.

Id: [0x00288AD5]
Cudd Lladron. The Thieves Warren... this is where I leave you.

Id: [0x00288AED]
Look, we wasn't gonna kill the lad! We've come to like having him around!

Id: [0x00288AF0]
Cynon did this? Why? I've done nothing--

Id: [0x00288AF2]
O gods, is he dead? Wake up! Wake up! Tell the Dane I've hand-fed ye like a baby sparrow.

Id: [0x00288B2C]
Come on, boy. We'll forge a man from your softness, hammered on the anvil of war.

Id: [0x00288B2D]
One does not need to fight to be a--

Id: [0x00288B2F]
Move! Move!

Id: [0x00288B30]
Calm, Ivarr. The fight's not here.

Id: [0x00288B32]
Aye. The fight is nowhere to be found in this boy.

Id: [0x00288B33]
A boy who happens to be Ceolwulf's son. Why is he not in his quarters?

Id: [0x00288B34]
Our future king wants a battle hardened heir. Time he proves his worth, don't you think?

Id: [0x00288B38]
I've had some training. I only … I don't want to kill anyone. These men are my friends, my countrymen.

Id: [0x00288B39]
Can't be an heir if he's dead, Ivarr. Can he wield a sword?

Id: [0x00288B3A]
Can't be an heir if he's dead, Ivarr. Can he wield a sword?

Id: [0x00288B3C]
Mm … he left it open for interpretation.

Id: [0x00288B3D]
Throwing a boy who stinks of fear to a pack of wolves is not the best way to train him. Are you sure that's what Ceolwulf wants?

Id: [0x00288B3E]
Throwing a boy who stinks of fear to a pack of wolves is not the best way to train him. Are you sure that's what Ceolwulf wants?

Id: [0x00288B42]
Learned this from one of the Daughters of Nimue. They're blessed in holy healing. It should help with the pain.

Id: [0x00288B43]
Thank you, Feran. You've been a great comfort.

Id: [0x00288B45]
Ivarr…

Id: [0x00288B46]
He comes with us. And should anything happen to this little sprout, I will bear the punishment our future king inflicts.

Id: [0x00288B47]
He'll want to remove your head.

Id: [0x00288B48]
Ah ah! You hear that, boy? You die, and I'll have to kill your father too.

Id: [0x00288B49]
Tewdwr'll need to see a healer, this lot've been smearing dung on his face. But I've been held for ransom by worse men.

Id: [0x00288B4B]
Thank you, stranger!

Id: [0x00288B56]
When I awoke in this demon lair, I feared the worst.

Id: [0x00288B62]
Keep careful watch.

Id: [0x00288B63]
Danes would gut your children for amusement.

Id: [0x00288B69]
Danes!

Id: [0x00288B6C]
Smoke!

Id: [0x00288B6D]
Someone set that fire. Find them.

Id: [0x00288B6F]
Do what you must, but return quickly. Our men are ready to move.

Id: [0x00288B72]
Perhaps a sickness of the blood. Shame, shame.[Changing gears] He was captured by the men there?

Id: [0x00288B74]
Cynon did this?

Id: [0x00288B76]
I am a very good healer, but if the gods want him to join them, I cannot stop their will. [pause]Eivor, what will you do with Cynon?

Id: [0x00288B81]
You are resolute then.[steadies herself] Then may you ride as Rhiannon.

Id: [0x00288B89]
Have a care, lord. These pagan rats outnumber us.

Id: [0x00288B8A]
I advise we strongly consider their demands, lord. We won't survive a fight.

Id: [0x00288B8C]
A man of God stands before you, Ivarr. Proud and resolute.

Id: [0x00288BC5]
The Nornir told me you'd be here. The cord is forged. Gleipnir, I call it.

Id: [0x00288BC9]
When you bind the beast, spare no loose ends. The cord will stretch or shrink to fit your needs.

Id: [0x00288BCB]
The more you tighten the cord, the stronger it will hold and the greater it will hurt, 'til the beast is rooted to the ground.

Id: [0x00288BCC]
A tale for another time. Thank you for this

Id: [0x00288BCD]
A tale for another time. Thank you for this.

How tightly will it hold? The beast may resist.

Id: [0x00288BD5]
Yes, but he's grown. I have kept him company, but he is consumed by a sadness I cannot understand.

A sacrifice for something greater. Is the wolf nearby?

Id: [0x00288C2D]
Aye, so if you find him dead or alive, then our names should be clear. Go with the wind. I'd join you but--

Gunnar!

Id: [0x00288C2F]
Gunnar!

Id: [0x00288C34]
Indeed. It's a surprise to see you. Is everything quite all right?

Mortals be gone. I'm summoning a spirit of the woods. I'll speak to no one else!

O spirit, you have finally come! Days ago, a passing cloud foretold your arrival with drops of sun-scented rain.

Id: [0x00288C80]
Changed me. Change the dressings…[passes out]

Id: [0x00288C88]
Something about your demeanor and your physical manifestation now gives me pause. Are you truly a spirit of light?

Id: [0x00288C8A]
I am a spirit as any other.

Id: [0x00288C8B]
I am a spirit as any other.

Id: [0x00288C8C]
Then prove it. You must know the depths of the world's mysteries before I will help you. Tell me the proper use of charms.

Id: [0x00288D4C]
Eivor! Did you bring us any treasure?

Id: [0x00288D4D]
Shut up, Rolf! How do you know? You never went on a raid!

Id: [0x00288D4E]
You shut up!

Id: [0x00288E16]
I was raised here, in fact. Learnt the scriptures of Christ's apostles in Lundenwic, our Saxon borough just past the western walls.

Id: [0x00288E17]
No, I was raised by them. And for a penniless bastard, I turned out pretty well.

Id: [0x00288E18]
Erke's an orphan of the last Viking horde to put down in Lunden for a season. Two or three years back now, it must have been.

Id: [0x00288E28]
We were fools! "Peace," they said. "There'll be peace!" And what? Of course there's no peace!

Id: [0x00288E29]
I've fought in this miserable country for two years gone. Lost half me foot and most of me mind.

Id: [0x00288E2C]
Quarry and cargo done. Now to meet Ivarr and Ceolbert in Wesberie, before Ivarr stirs up more trouble.

Id: [0x00288E36]
There we are. The quarry and Wenlocan, both done. That should shake Rhodri to his senses.

Look at the size of this beautiful creature! Impressive, isn't it?

Id: [0x00288E3B]
Clear eyes, strong haunches. It must come from powerful stock.

I did.

You didn't refuse him outright?

I told him it was your choice alone.

Id: [0x00288E5E]
I told him it was your choice alone.

Id: [0x00288E60]
One that does not involve selling off your queen, I trust.

I will not barter with my body!

That would be a first.

Id: [0x00288E7B]
Hold on, I've got it … the blunt end of my hammer on his family stones!

Id: [0x00288E7C]
You are overthinking this, all of you. Give this Builder an impossible task … a deadline of, say, nine days.

Id: [0x00288E80]
When he forfeits, as he no doubt will, Freyja remains free, and we may finish his work as intended.

Id: [0x00288E81]
He would be mad or stupid to agree!

Id: [0x00288E82]
You underestimate men of intellect, Lord of Storms. The Builder is a proud man. He won't back down from a challenge.

Id: [0x00288E83]
I do not like this.

Id: [0x00288E8E]
We kill them, they kill us. They kill us, we kill them. Simple as that.

Id: [0x00288E8F]
All part o' God's grand plan.

Nor do I, but we must act. Loki, bring this offer to the Builder.

That cannot be right. I would never betray Sigurd. He's my brother, my family.

Just the way he likes it. Welcome to Eurvicscire, friend.

Lay low? After all I have done here, you tell me to dunk my head?

Id: [0x002890CE]
To my first night in Fornburg in over two winters. It must end with me soaked and wall-eyed, shouting at the shadows of trolls!

Id: [0x002890D0]
Yes! You are stuck with me, drengr. Now drink!

"Where is King Burgred?" That is what you want. And what makes you think I have the slightest idea?

What can I say? The king pays well for my services. If only I could say the same for those two Ragnarsson clods.

A thing of beauty. Frankish, I believe. What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x002891A9]
A two-faced, smirking glory-hound…

Id: [0x002891AD]
Shhh, not here, not now. Dance, sing, and fill yourself with ale, then meet me atop this tower of stone.

What does friendship mean to you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002891EB]
Leave all that aside, Eivor. Tonight we are family again.

You Britons got no cause to truck with us. We done nothin' wrong!

Is your daughter hungry? I have bread.

Id: [0x0028926A]
We're no fools. What do you want in return?

Id: [0x0028926B]
Nothing… I have a little girl of my own at home. The same age.

Id: [0x0028926C]
Give it here, then, and quick about it. Can't have anyone seein' me hobnobbin' with a Briton!

Id: [0x00289270]
No harvest again this fall. The Britons burned me crops.

Id: [0x00289271]
Aye, it'll be a long, pitiful winter.

Id: [0x00289272]
God will punish the Britons for this war. They'll burn in the fires of Hell, they will.

Id: [0x00289278]
We've had nothing for days.

Id: [0x00289279]
Nettle and turnips. It's all I could find.

There you go, young man.

In the gloaming, see her roaming, hidden 'neath a hood…

That's why Rhodri's talking peace now. It's thanks to Ivarr.

Curse this war. Say your thanks, Bertwic.

Thank you, ma'am.

The mad swamp woman must be contained. To know that she is wandering wild makes me … uneasy.

The mad swamp woman must be contained. To know that she is wandering wild makes me … uneasy.

Id: [0x00289504]
This way. Your gift awaits.

Id: [0x00289505]
Kill the Danes!

Id: [0x00289533]
There you are.

Id: [0x00289534]
You're working overtime.

Id: [0x00289535]
Must have collapsed when the ice melted.

Id: [0x0028953E]
Look around. See what you can find. I'll send for Ceolwulf … tell him we found a throne.

Id: [0x00289621]
Hey, sorry about pulling you out. The generator was sputtering.

Id: [0x00289622]
How was the Animus data stream? Comfortable?

Id: [0x00289626]
Good. Just give me a sec, and you can jump back in.

Id: [0x00289641]
Look, Eivor, we're mates right? Had drinks together? Remember the chickens?

Id: [0x00289648]
Your grand scheme has collapsed into sand at every step, Cynon.

Id: [0x00289649]
Your grand scheme has collapsed into sand at every step, Cynon.

Id: [0x00289651]
Then make your peace with god, Briton. For shitting on my name and drugging me is an offense I kill for.

Id: [0x00289657]
I always desired Modron, so when she asked me to take the part in a fertility ritual, of course I agreed.

Id: [0x002896A9]
Well, there is but one Lord of Northumbria.

Id: [0x002896D6]
Have you used this sort of magic before?

Id: [0x002896D7]
Have you used this sort of magic before?

Why struggle and fight if we are but threads stretched between anchored points? Without hope, life is a prison, not a gift.

Id: [0x002896E7]
Why struggle and fight if we are but threads stretched between anchored points? Without hope, life is a prison, not a gift.

Id: [0x002896F3]
I saw Odin. And the Nornir, spinning the threads of fate. They were watching me.

Id: [0x002896F4]
I saw Odin. And the Nornir, spinning the threads of fate. They were watching me.

Id: [0x002896F6]
And the wolf was eager for my attention. As if it were … beckoning me to follow.

Id: [0x002896F7]
And the wolf was eager for my attention. As if it were … beckoning me to follow.

Id: [0x002896F9]
Shades of Valhalla. For which you are destined.

Id: [0x002896FA]
I saw the gates to Odin's hall of slain champions. They opened for me.

Id: [0x002896FB]
I saw the gates to Odin's hall of slain champions. They opened for me.

Id: [0x0028970C]
Hm. Not watching. They were showing you the way forward. Your life. Your path. What lies before you, and where it ends.

Id: [0x00289712]
You are the Wolf-Kissed, fated to carry its mark for life. In this case, it might represent your ambition … or your fear.

Id: [0x00289717]
Tell me everything.

Id: [0x00289718]
Gods, I thought I … what was that?

Id: [0x00289719]
Gods, I thought I … wh-what was that?

Id: [0x0028971C]
Then I awoke.

Id: [0x0028971D]
Then I awoke.

Id: [0x00289726]
Watch yourself, lovely dove.

Id: [0x0028972F]
If it were my men killed, I would be on my way to Lunden now.

Id: [0x00289730]
If it were my men killed, I would be on my way to Lunden now.

Id: [0x00289732]
You're unharmed. Praise be to God!

Id: [0x00289736]
It'll take more than a few lads with newly polished bows to fell me.

Id: [0x00289737]
It'll take more than a few lads with newly polished bows to fell me.

Id: [0x0028973C]
With Avgos gone, I'll turn my attention to The Leech.

Id: [0x0028973D]
With Avgos gone, I will turn my attention to The Leech.

Id: [0x0028973E]
The Compass will come, and we must be ready. Expecting the worst.

Id: [0x00289755]
The Nornir have spoken, and this is their message.

Id: [0x00289756]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x00289778]
I don't want anyone catching me off guard. Could we take the fight to him?

Id: [0x00289779]
I do not want anyone catching me off guard. Could we take the fight to him?

Not yet crowned king and already grooming his successor. That shows some boldness.

Id: [0x0028981F]
Not yet crowned king and already grooming his successor. That shows some boldness.

Id: [0x00289820]
Relax, little king. They won't call you friend now. You can thank your father for that.

Id: [0x00289822]
Right. And bold kings need bolder sons.

Id: [0x00289827]
Enough jawing, heathens! Speak your piece.

Id: [0x00289941]
If she can't be trusted, what use is she?

How did you find a woman in these backwoods?

Id: [0x00289947]
How did you find a woman in these backwoods?

Id: [0x0028994B]
What do you do around here, Brigid? Except keep Gunnar out of mischief.

Id: [0x0028994C]
What do you do around here, Brigid? Except keep Gunnar out of mischief.

Id: [0x0028994D]
That is for us to find out. We may be able to satisfy her…

Id: [0x00289952]
She came through the settlement selling runes. Outshone every stone in her satchel.

Id: [0x00289963]
Sigurd. What brings you strolling into my camp this brisk day?

Id: [0x00289964]
I suspect you already know.

Id: [0x00289965]
Yes.[sniff] The embers on the air betray you. And yet, if you are here talking to me, King Burgred remains at large.

Id: [0x00289967]
And who are you, lovely dove? Want to perch your ass on my lap?

Id: [0x00289972]
Not interested.

Id: [0x00289973]
Not interested.

Id: [0x00289975]
Come now. You are too clever to run with those Ragnarsson dogs. Plenty of room on this side, if you want to earn some coin.

Id: [0x00289977]
Call me Eivor. Or Wolf-Kissed. "Lovely dove" will get your throat cut.

Id: [0x00289978]

We came for your help, not your flattery.

Id: [0x0028998B]
Here's your silver.

Id: [0x0028998C]
Here's your silver.

Id: [0x00289990]
She offered me a trade, a rune for a brooch I was making. I got the better deal, [about himself]but she loves the ugly little thing.

Id: [0x002899C3]
You take me for a fool?

Id: [0x002899C4]
You take me for a fool?

Id: [0x002899C7]
No, no, no, we're here for the festival and blessings. Brigid's hand must be given. You know me, Eivor, I'm forged in honor.

Id: [0x002899C9]
Ivarr, you have scuppered the peace!

Id: [0x002899E4]
Little cubs of mine, don't stray too far.

Id: [0x002899E5]
It's a cold, dark day, come sit by the <LF>hearth!

Id: [0x002899E7]
Come hear of the tales, from before your birth.

Id: [0x002899FF]
The novelty of this soggy North has worn on me, Eivor. Too warm for winter living, too cold for summer.

Id: [0x00289A22]
Don't let Faravid fool you. He's hiding something.

Id: [0x00289A25]
O, you're a fancy one! Sitting up in Halfdan's tower!

Id: [0x00289A2C]
Signs of battle.

Id: [0x00289A2D]
Signs of battle.

Id: [0x00289A35]
Hard fought on both sides.

Id: [0x00289A36]
Hard fought on both sides.

Id: [0x00289A3B]
The battle climbed into the hills.

Id: [0x00289A3C]
The battle climbed into the hills.

Id: [0x00289A41]
Help the wounded. And get every man's name. We leave none behind.

Id: [0x00289A44]
Hey, who's that?

Id: [0x00289A4A]
Well met, Eivor Raven-Friend.

Id: [0x00289A52]
Ah, Eivor my friend. Is Donecaestre hospitality to your liking?

Id: [0x00289A55]
This is our fight, our chance for glory. Fly on home, crow.

Id: [0x00289A5B]
One sword is not an army, Eivor. Even a hero needs loyal friends. I have never lost sight of that. Never!

Id: [0x00289AC7]
Ivarr the Boneless. [scoff]You make a pitiful dragon.

Id: [0x00289ADD]
My ladylove calls, Eivor. O, if you'd like to join us later, we're going hoodening this eve.

Id: [0x00289B29]
I am here to hasten my friend's marriage and drink my weight in ale. If friendship comes afterwards, then all the better.

Id: [0x00289B2A]
I am here to hasten my friend's marriage and drink my weight in ale. If friendship comes afterwards, then all the better.

Id: [0x00289B4E]
You have won, Ivarr. And if you will not kill him now, then let him go. Humiliation will chase him to the end of his days.

Id: [0x00289B4F]
You have won, Ivarr. And if you will not kill him now, then let him go. Humiliation will chase him to the end of his days.

Id: [0x00289B50]
The man is dying. Come away, let the Nornir spin his fate.

Id: [0x00289B51]
The man is dying. Come away, let the Nornir spin his fate.

Id: [0x00289CDA]
I can get you to the others. I'll go easy.

Id: [0x00289CDB]
I can get you to the others. I'll go easy.

Id: [0x00289CE7]
Eivor!

Id: [0x00289CE9]
I found him deep in a cave, beset by wolves.

Id: [0x00289CEA]
I found him deep in a cave, beset by wolves.

Id: [0x00289CEB]
Ivarr…

Id: [0x00289CEC]
Easy boy, easy!

Id: [0x00289CED]
I-Ivarr…

Id: [0x00289CEE]
Get me an axe, right fucking now!

Id: [0x00289CF0]
An axe!

Id: [0x00289CF2]
Ivarr. He's gone.

Id: [0x00289CF3]
Ivarr. He's gone.

Id: [0x00289CF4]
His god will take him as he is, axe or not.

Id: [0x00289CF5]
His god will take him as he is, axe or not.

Id: [0x00289CF6]
A Briton's dagger. Rhodri!

Id: [0x00289CF8]
I told you he was a trickster! Peace was never his goal. He takes blood for blood!

Id: [0x00289CFC]
Lord above, what's happened? Ceolbert!

Id: [0x00289CFE]
You murdered his brother. Did you think he would let that lie so easily?

Id: [0x00289CFF]
You murdered his brother. Did you think he would let that lie so easily?

Id: [0x00289D00]
Bishop Deorlaf! Over here!

Id: [0x00289D01]
Bishop Deorlaf! Over here!

Id: [0x00289D08]
Send the boy's body to his father. He'll want a Christian burial.

Id: [0x00289D0E]
Ei … Eivor … I…

Id: [0x00289D10]
Hush, Ceolbert. We'll soon be among friends.

Id: [0x00289D11]
Hush, Ceolbert. We'll soon be among friends.

Id: [0x00289D1D]
I came too late to stop this. The Picts set fires and ran. They mean to spite us!

Id: [0x00289D33]
Now to kill any stragglers.

Id: [0x00289D34]
Now to kill any stragglers.

Id: [0x00289D3E]
A hard way to see the world. Hard, but fair.

Id: [0x00289D42]
Ulf, piss off.

Id: [0x00289D44]
Small men always talk big. So, was Halfdan generous? Did you get what you came for?

Id: [0x00289D4A]
Dunwic… Now to clear out Rued's men, and light that brazier.

Id: [0x00289D4B]
Dunwic… Now to clear out Rued's men, and light that brazier.

Id: [0x00289D50]
That's the last of them. Once the brazier is lit, the rest of Rued's men should arrive.

Id: [0x00289D51]
That's the last of them. Once the brazier is lit, the rest of Rued's men should arrive.

Id: [0x00289D53]
Run for the bridge!

Id: [0x00289D54]
Run for the bridge!

Id: [0x00289D5F]
Spoken like the volur. It is indeed a kind of magic.

Id: [0x00289D64]
The brothers' fleet, gathered and ready.

Id: [0x00289D65]
The brothers' fleet, gathered and ready.

Id: [0x00289D6C]
We've been spotted!

Id: [0x00289D6F]
Arrows!

Id: [0x00289D72]
Eivor, I'm so glad you've made it!

Id: [0x00289D75]
Eivor, care for a challenge?

Id: [0x00289D7A]
Skal, Eivor! Let's have a drink!

Id: [0x00289D7D]
A Dane? Leading a Saxon army?

Id: [0x00289D86]
What happened?

Id: [0x00289D87]
What happened?

Id: [0x00289D8C]
Friendship can also spoil, like rotten meat.

Id: [0x00289DA5]
Seems, yes. As a bright sky in winter seems warm. But rumors fly of little men plotting treason in the dark.

Id: [0x00289DB9]
Not yet. That is where you enter my saga. Prove this for me. Discover if Faravid has been disloyal. Then we shall talk of oaths.

Id: [0x00289DCA]
You see this? From a sea unicorn. I filter my mead and wine with it.

Id: [0x00289E19]
Halfdan didn't send you north to fight a skirmish we could win with half our numbers. Why are you here, Eivor?

Id: [0x00289E1E]
Doubts my loyalty? I have fought for Halfdan, killed for Halfdan, bled for Halfdan, and he doubts me?

Id: [0x00289E2A]
You never gave it.

Id: [0x00289E30]
A captain of Wigmund's is a fine prize.

Id: [0x00289E31]
A captain of Wigmund's is a fine prize.

Id: [0x00289E4F]
Oh… Mint tea is not actually tea, Becs. It's an infusion … it's really just dirty minty water.

Id: [0x00289E5F]
Ceolbert, listen to this old man's stories and wipe his drool for him.

Id: [0x00289E60]
Ceolbert, listen to this old man's stories and wipe his drool for him.

Id: [0x00289E7E]
I should have seen this coming. I should have known he would come for the weakest of us.

Id: [0x00289E84]
An overlook I found while scouting. A view, one fit for a dying king.

Id: [0x00289E85]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x00289E86]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x00289E8C]
More deer.

Id: [0x00289E8D]
More deer.

Id: [0x00289E97]
"Leave this land, and give your people fair warning," he says. "Tell them King Rhodri gave you that cut."

Id: [0x00289E99]
You opened a bloody wound when you killed Rhodri's brother.

Id: [0x00289E9A]
You opened a bloody wound when you killed Rhodri's brother.

Id: [0x00289EB3]
So, we are Harald's subjects now.

Id: [0x00289EB4]
Harald declared himself King of all Norway. Styrbjorn bent the knee. And I drank.

Id: [0x00289ECE]
Another satellite came down. Did you see?

Id: [0x00289ECF]
I did. One of Abstergo's.

Id: [0x00289ED0]
Well, most of North America just lost its GPS service. So… It depends what you mean by good, really.

Id: [0x00289EDF]
If not worth telling, it is worth remembering. Years ago, I was headed back from the Western Isle, ah, they have got fighters there!

Id: [0x00289EE0]
The fog clears a bit, and there they are, all lined up. The biggest one calls out, "I am Rhodri, king of this land."

Id: [0x00289EEB]
That's fine. I needed air.

Id: [0x00289EEC]
That's good.

Id: [0x00289F1B]
"That means shit to me," I scream back. I give my boys a nod, and we raise up our axes and charge before they take a breath.

Id: [0x00289F1C]
We have the numbers. But the Britons are clever. It's marshland. The bog catches our boots, sucks us to a standstill.

Id: [0x00289F1D]
One by one, Rhodri cuts us to bits. He gets to me, lays his blade at my cheek and gives me this nick.

Id: [0x00289F2E]
Ah! Hello, hello. Are you the leader of this bustling encampment?

Id: [0x00289F32]
That sweat-sopped slug is just beyond those walls.

Id: [0x00289F3E]
"May only be defeated by a dragon" my itching ass. He'll meet one, all right.

Id: [0x00289F5C]
I'm seeing two different data streams, overlapped in the same DNA. Not sure why.

Id: [0x00289F5D]
I can parse the streams with a filter. Hold on…

Id: [0x00289F5E]
There's a third option too. I can let the Animus modulate your identity, based on signal strength.

Id: [0x00289F7B]
By your leave, lord, I must return to my forward camp. It's a long, cold ride.

Id: [0x00289F7D]
Eivor and I felled them, Halfdan Jarl, so you could sweep in, stab a few cold corpses, and claim a glorious victory.

Id: [0x00289F7F]
Old friend, your jests hit like Odin's spear, always on the mark.

Id: [0x00289F8C]
I'm sorry, but you cannot endanger yourselves like this, lords. You have people to lead, a future to consider.

Id: [0x00289F9C]
Or a man who makes kings.

Id: [0x00289FF0]
Gaze upon my face, King of Crow-food, and meet the dragon that will devour you!

Id: [0x0028A006]
Enough talking, Ivarr.

Id: [0x0028A007]
Enough talking, Ivarr.

Id: [0x0028A07D]
He is hiding behind that door. Remember, he is mine.

Id: [0x0028A0B1]
Eivor!

Id: [0x0028A0DA]
You're a long way from home, Eivor. Hm.

Id: [0x0028A0DD]
I'm not going anywhere. Not yet.

Id: [0x0028A0FA]
So take what you desire from my hoard. For this … this is only a taste of things to come. Tomorrow, the Raven Clan starts anew!

Id: [0x0028A0FB]
I don't care what you call it, Shaun. Did you buy any?

Id: [0x0028A0FC]
Of course I did, love.

Id: [0x0028A100]
Bash it down.

Id: [0x0028A101]
Bash it down.

Id: [0x0028A103]
And you, Eivor. Come! I have something special for you.

Id: [0x0028A134]
Ah! What the hell is that?

Id: [0x0028A138]
You have snared my curiosity, Brother. What is it?

Id: [0x0028A139]
You have snared my curiosity, Brother. What is it?

Id: [0x0028A13B]
Not yet. Drinks first!

Id: [0x0028A13F]
Alright, I'll lock it in and push ahead. To a time where these streams are more synchronized.

Id: [0x0028A163]
Mentor, does Eivor intend to join us?

Id: [0x0028A164]
Not that I am aware.

Id: [0x0028A169]
As is your right, but what of a karl like me? Those at the bottom drink what dribbles from up top.

Id: [0x0028A16F]
Styrbjorn seems content to follow Harald, wherever he may lead. But I gave no oath.

Id: [0x0028A170]

Id: [0x0028A171]
You have the choice to stay or go, Dag. That is freedom enough.

Id: [0x0028A172]
You have the choice to stay or go, Dag. That is freedom enough.

Id: [0x0028A1B7]
Then why offer her the blade? Surely we have more--

Id: [0x0028A1B8]
Hytham. Hush.

Id: [0x0028A208]
Basim has shown me so much about the world. All of which I will share with you … when the time is right.

Id: [0x0028A25B]
[FIGHT, STABBED IN THE EYE, AND KNOCKOUT ONOS]

Id: [0x0028A2B4]
O, no, this will be good. I have something specific in mind. A place and a method. Come!

Id: [0x0028A311]
He's not dead.

Id: [0x0028A312]
He's not dead.

Id: [0x0028A315]
No. I have something else planned. Spectacle, remember?

Id: [0x0028A31E]
He is nothing now but a sad sack of flesh. Kill him and be done with it.

[laugh]How are you doing, dear king? Stay with us. You must not miss what is coming!

Id: [0x0028A3F5]
Just … finish me.

Id: [0x0028A405]
No, no, no. He must die with style.

There is no need for spectacle, Ivarr. Let the man die.

I saw someone run from the outskirts of Grantebridge to the shore, just before the fighting started. Too dark to see who.

Id: [0x0028A5AC]
I didn't. I was in the longhouse, drinking with Birna and her men all night. She can really put it away!

Id: [0x0028A5AD]
I saw two Saxons riding past the city while I was on guard. One to the Meldeburne monastery, and one toward Utbech Camp.

Id: [0x0028A6AB]
Hmph. When he crawls into bed to warm me, as you say, it will be with farts and honeyed breath.

Id: [0x0028A6AD]
Ah, we should all be so lucky.

Our Bishop Deorlaf and King Rhodri are ensconced in the church ahead.

Id: [0x0028A72D]
Yet within is warmth. The Christian God unites King Rhodri, Bishop Deorlaf, and myself. On His ground, peace will be made.

Id: [0x0028A730]
These houses of Christ. They're all so hard and cold.

Right, so … so what's The Order miffed about? I'm doing my duty.

I'm here about The Leech. The tools you made were unsound.

I should go.

I should go.

Id: [0x0028A7D2]
Well done, Eivor. These early victories will pay off well.

Id: [0x0028A7D4]
Eivor King-Maker we shall call you soon.

Id: [0x0028A7D6]
Yes, my scouts told me. Such a tragic death for so dubious a gain. I hope you paid his killers back in kind.

Id: [0x0028A7DC]
The loud one, an ealdorman? Well, should he ever wish to call for aid, he need only shout.

Id: [0x0028A7DE]
Sad news, but you made the best of it.

Id: [0x0028A7E0]
Quite so.

Id: [0x0028A7E2]
But we are allied with them?

Id: [0x0028A7E6]
Rest, then. You have earned it.

Id: [0x0028A7E8]
Good. Very good.

Id: [0x0028A7EA]
Understood. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x0028A7EC]
Good. Hytham will be pleased.

Id: [0x0028A7EE]
You do this work well, Eivor. Is it a prelude to you joining the Hidden Ones?

My axe, Eivor. Hand me my weapon.

Eivor! Give it here…!

Id: [0x0028A94B]
Eivor…

Id: [0x0028A94D]
Eivor. A word of note… Someone has set up shop outside. A trader, I believe.

Id: [0x0028A94F]
I look forward to knowing him better.

Id: [0x0028A950]
When you can, ask him his business here. He seems to represent a larger guild. The Child's Eyes. Or the Eyeless Children?

Therefore, Sciropescire declares herself your friend and ally, and will remain so for the length of my days.

As he wanted, then.

He died a fighter. In all his glory.

Burgred paid me to steer the Ragnarssons clear of two areas. Ledecestre and Templebrough Fort. It was a hefty amount.

Id: [0x0028AD66]
If I were you, that's where I'd look. And that is all I know. Not more, not less. We are done here.

Id: [0x0028AD67]
Find the king! Put him on his knees before me.

Hm. This will do. Thank you, Eivor.

An end you did not deny him.

Ivarr. It's done.

Our next steps are critical, my lords. And after what happened in Quatford, it is clear to me that Ivarr should lay low.

Glad to have her. Good work.

Hamund has sailed East to my home. Giermund has already taken to war in England, fighting with Guthrum's men.

Id: [0x0028B5C6]
The Sons of Ragnar are in need of warriors in Jorvik. Glory and good pay. I could save you a seat on our ship.

You and Hjorr showed courage at the Althing (clan gathering), talking to Harald like that.

Did it help her?

Id: [0x0028B5D9]
Did it help her?

Id: [0x0028B5DC]
For a time. It opened her up to visions. Strange, unreadable things. Then she returned to her current state.

Id: [0x0028B5E6]
The gods favor you, Eivor. They always have. You will have your glory, and you will earn your place in Valhalla.

Id: [0x0028B5FA]
Soma! That's not true!

Id: [0x0028B5FB]
A grown man should have a better grasp of his jealousy. It must not drive him to madness and destruction.

Id: [0x0028B5FC]
But with you? Every one of our warriors, our slaughtered people, are dead because you couldn't be where I am now.

Id: [0x0028B5FE]
I have only ever served you, Soma! I would never betray my clan. My family! I'm a man of honor!

Id: [0x0028B886]
And ambition…

Id: [0x0028B894]
Hush! Your prattling offends God's ears.

Id: [0x0028B8A5]
I had my doubts about this plan Ivarr, but I believe it may work. This blow we dealt Rhodri is a painful one.

Id: [0x0028B8AD]
All your efforts to evade destiny will only fling you further along its course.

You are Eivor, yes? Of the Raven's flock. I heard you had returned. Not with war on your mind, I hope.

Id: [0x0028B8E3]
Good to hear. Have your victories in England satisfied your itch for conquest?

Id: [0x0028B8E4]
[laugh]So what brings you here? To my shores?

Id: [0x0028B8E6]
Did I choose this? Or was it thrust upon me? I find it difficult to see the difference sometimes.

Id: [0x0028B8E8]
May we endure this pain until our hearts guide us to each other again.

Id: [0x0028B8EA]
It may be a little of both.

Leave him. He will do little harm while his son remains captive.

We ain't ready to attack, Eivor. Eadwyn's still too strong. Too well supplied, and got more men coming.

Id: [0x0028B90A]
What now, Wise One? We have returned to the place from which we set out. Ragnarok is coming, and we are no safer.

Id: [0x0028B90E]
I will watch over him as one of my own kin.

No. She's here somewhere.

Could they have moved her?

What do you know of honor, Freyja? You've bedded more men than all the halls in Midgard.

Id: [0x0028B957]
But you won't break it, Havi. You cannot.

Id: [0x0028B962]
I haven't! Soma! You're the key to my life. You must lead me to my destiny. Carry me to the summit of victory!

Id: [0x0028B964]
Do not warp what is real with the stories you tell yourself. I have seen no signs of your destiny.

Id: [0x0028B965]
How dare you think your destiny, your greatness, outweighed all of ours?

Id: [0x0028B973]
Through here.

Through here.

Id: [0x0028B98B]
What?

Id: [0x0028B98C]
What in Hel's name are you doing, Father?

Id: [0x0028B98F]
You said nothing of this to me, not a word! And I will not yield a title that should be mine by right!

Id: [0x0028B990]
Then war will continue. Men will die, villages will burn, you foolish boy! This is our only way towards true peace!

I will feed your teeth, wrapped in your tongue, bacraut (asshole)!

Id: [0x0028BB5A]
What were you thinking? Drinking mead on an empty stomach.

Id: [0x0028BB5C]
You have to eat something before drinking that much.

How does that go … "Feed before mead"?

Id: [0x0028BB60]
I have some roasted lamb on a spit. Are you coming?

Id: [0x0028BB92]
We need not fear Odin's eye, only Halfdan's wrath.

Id: [0x0028BB95]
Good, good. Victory is ours.

Id: [0x0028BB9A]
If you tell him, he'll demand we forswear our attack. Are you willing to risk a victory like that? Our glory?

Id: [0x0028BBA3]
A little sour but not bad. I've always preferred ale myself. Or spiced mead.

Id: [0x0028BBC1]
Ah! Here you see? Spoils of war. Mine. Stolen from me!

Id: [0x0028BBE4]
I'm beset on all sides, Eivor. By plotters and schemers.

Id: [0x0028C031]
Arrows nocked!

Id: [0x0028C032]
It's a hard thing to raise the rats of a city into warriors.

Id: [0x0028C033]
No! I gave these men order! I gave them purpose! I showed them their common enemy!

Id: [0x0028C034]
Anchor strings! Second wave, fire!

Id: [0x0028C306]
Ja. Then let's introduce you to Tewdwr.

Id: [0x0028C307]
Ah, yes. The way Gunnar speaks, I expected--

Id: [0x0028C30D]
[ONO: clears throat]Shall we, then?

Id: [0x0028C30E]
Go. May you have a fire-forged friendship. Watch for fairies, fen-folk, and fiends.

Id: [0x0028C33E]
In spite of these war-cries, you should know that Vili's father is more frail than last you saw him.

Id: [0x0028C354]
Eivor, just in time to divide the spoils. Take some mead, if you like.

Id: [0x0028C358]
Worry about the Picts later. Now's the time for treasure and spoils. You earned it.

Id: [0x0028C35D]
Fuck Halfdan. If the Raven wants wine, the Raven gets wine. Open it, Faravid.

Id: [0x0028C361]
Deliver this goblet to my jarl. He has a fondness for them. And tell him his share of the spoils is coming.

Id: [0x0028C382]
Fair is fair.

Id: [0x0028C4AB]
Ah, more pagans crowding our table. Just lovely. What brings you here?

Id: [0x0028C4B4]
And why not? I've been told I have a rather expert tongue.

Id: [0x0028C4B6]
Only good for yawping, I see.

Nothing. You?

She could have told him anything. Sold him secrets. About me, about Repton, our plans.

Id: [0x0028C5A6]
Why bother with all this pageantry? Fashion a new crown and stick it on your melon. There you have it, you're the new king.

Id: [0x0028C5A7]
That is not how it works. Not in Mercia.

This. Do you know that symbol?

Yet still floating! Tell me, how did my old friend like his goblet gift.

Id: [0x0028C5F3]
I will wash the castle walls with Rhodri's blood.

Id: [0x0028C611]
Rhodri! Your dragon has arrived!

Push the mangy dogs back!

At last, a real battle.

Do it, then. Leave Glowecestrescire in the hands of that Christian, and for what? Your name and some trade routes.

Id: [0x0028C7B3]
You! Dane! Get me out of this cursed chicken coop!

Men for Deorlaf's fyrd. More valuable than cargo.

Out with it.

Id: [0x0028C8CB]
I will join you, Sigurd.

Id: [0x0028C8CC]
That leaves me Ledecestre, then. All by my fucking lonesome.

Id: [0x0028C8CD]
Bring a friend, Brother. Maybe Eivor dares to be called that.

Id: [0x0028C8E2]
Hardly the behavior of someone expecting an attack.

Id: [0x0028C8E3]
There is honor among even the lowliest of men. Danes know that better than most.

You think she wanted to leave us?

The shipyard is exposed and far from the tunnel entrance. Not the ideal man to lead Saxons into the city.

Id: [0x0028C926]
This city thrives under me, as a bustling port for his longships, for instance.

Id: [0x0028C934]
Why are you still here?

Id: [0x0028C935]
I'm fitting to gobble you up.

Id: [0x0028C936]
There's nothing left for you here.

Yellow is a troublesome color to make. He was upset when his stores were stolen.

Id: [0x0028C96B]
Visions are like clouds. Each person sees a different meaning in the shape, and Galinn sees an important meaning.

Id: [0x0028C96F]
He's an odd one, that man. But he is a man, not a toddler. He doesn't need a constant watch.

Id: [0x0028C973]
Yes, people thought him cursed. He was adrift in deep water. But don't we all deserve a guide back to the shallows?

Id: [0x0028C9A2]
Your men have any luck?

Id: [0x0028C9A3]

Why would he mark his longboat differently from the rest of ours?

Id: [0x0028C9E0]
Did they recognize the person?

Id: [0x0028C9E2]
No, they couldn't be seen through the fog. But whoever it was, they knew something bad was coming.

There's no yellow on our longships beyond some small details … if there's a yellow longship in the Fens, I want to know.

Whoever betrayed you, they did so by marking the tunnel entrance, then opening the way to let the Saxons in.

The birth of a blood eagle is a sight to behold, my friend! First, I slice the length of your spine.

Id: [0x0028CC04]
I pushed that dragon dagger into his heart.

Id: [0x0028CC0E]
We are not finished, Eivor.

Id: [0x0028CC14]
Like a son to me! Yes, yes! So fight me, Wolf-Kissed! To a glorious death!

You are a spirit of light! Mabon be praised. Would you like some bread and cream?

Id: [0x0028CD57]
Aye. A mix to help him sleep. I filled this very pouch. And over a dandelion wine, he spoke fondly of his home, Cudd Lladron.

Id: [0x0028CD59]
No, just the answer to a question. This herb-pouch made its way to Glowecestre in the hands of a strange man. Do you know it?

I stand in Vili's place today. He and his father have gone to Ulkerthorpe to stave off an invasion of Picts.

After all this time, Eivor! We have arrived! Now raise a horn with Freyja here and sing a victory song!

Id: [0x0028D20A]
The battle horn blows! Come, Tyr!

Go, Eivor. Enjoy the fight. You have earned your place here.

My Eivor! There you are! What a warrior you have made of yourself. I am overfilled with pride!

Id: [0x0028D25D]
That was not a lie, that was my gift to you. I have power here. And I can do as I please.

Id: [0x0028D260]
Your father died doing what he hoped would save you. He died to protect you. And his clan.

Id: [0x0028D263]
This is the end of our road, Eivor. This is Valhalla, the eternal golden field. Now come … battle beckons!

Id: [0x0028D26B]
That was not my father. That was a lie.

Id: [0x0028D26C]

Why leave this place? A glory you fought so hard to find?

Id: [0x0028D2F2]
I'm glad you and your brother have come. If only to bring some measure of calm.

Id: [0x0028D332]
It won't matter. So long as Burgred is free, the people will call him king. He must abdicate his crown to me.

That might improve her impression of you.

Id: [0x0028D367]
We have the same father, Eivor. But his mother was a sow.

Id: [0x0028D369]
Meet us at Tonna's camp when you're finished here. And bring your patience.

Id: [0x0028D36B]
And your axe!

Id: [0x0028D374]
My son told me what happened earlier, with Ivarr pressuring him to fight. He said you intervened.

I don't like the way those soldiers watch me.

We're wasting time.

There are stables beyond the monastery where we can speak in peace.

Id: [0x0028D3CD]
Burgred had his secret haunts, but he never told me of them. Kept me quite in the dark … for good reason, I suppose.

The Arrow is described as a pugnacious Dane invader. That describes too many in Lunden.

Id: [0x0028E68C]
The Leech hails from Wessex. Lunden is home to many of them as well.

Id: [0x0028E68D]
Even that would be unwise, until we know more.

Can I help you with something else?

Id: [0x0028E6AE]
If I had betrayed this city, I'd be gone now, wouldn't I?

Id: [0x0028E6B2]
You're back again, Sunbeam?

Id: [0x0028E6B5]
I need to get going.

Id: [0x0028E6B6]
I need to get going.

Einherjar! Here is the battle you died to attain! For Havi. And for Asgard!

Id: [0x0028E851]
Havi! I found this one lurking in the shade, shying from battle. Shall I extract some teeth to get him talking? Or pluck out an eye?

Id: [0x0028E853]
He wants your name, not your trade.

Id: [0x0028E856]
You were told to guard this portal, Loki. What happened?

I do, or I did. That is to say, I passed through. But I am not of that place, which pleases me well, for I hated it.

Id: [0x0028E86C]
As a builder, yes, for a time. But they took a dislike to my methods which are … shall I say, magical in nature.

Id: [0x0028E86E]
Do you come from Jotunheim?

Yes! My ferocious swan! One of those backbiters stole it!

Id: [0x0028E880]
Eivor, my champion. Could you recover it for me? The honor of my house depends on it!

Id: [0x0028E882]
We should get to Lincoln as quickly as we can.

Come to the southern gates of Lincoln when you've recovered it.

Is that the last of them?

Havi, when someone gifts you a horse, you ride it. I'd put a bridle on this one.

Id: [0x0028E89D]
I've been among the giants, learned their weaknesses. My shield will succeed where yours have failed.

Id: [0x0028E89F]
We have tried all manner of barriers, and still we are breached. What makes you think yours could keep out giants or worse?

Id: [0x0028E8A0]
We have tried all manner of barriers, and still we are breached. What makes you think yours could keep out giants or worse?

Id: [0x0028E8A4]
I must give that a thought, a very deep thought. It would not be a simple task, and I do have my reputation to consider.

Id: [0x0028E8A6]
And what do you want in exchange for this shield? Other than your freedom?

Id: [0x0028E8A7]
And what do you want in exchange for this shield? Other than your freedom?

Id: [0x0028E8AB]
That I came when I did was by design. I have been among your enemies for so long, I know how they hunger for your demise.

Id: [0x0028E8AD]
Quite a coincidence that you came when you did. At the tail end of a brutal attack.

The nobles here will convene a shiremoot to select a new candidate. The winner will stand before the king for approval.

Id: [0x0028E8B6]
I recognize that from the Mithraic Temple.

Id: [0x0028E8B7]
I passed it on the way here.

Id: [0x0028E8B8]
What is this symbol here?

What's this symbol here?

Id: [0x0028E8BA]
I'll accept these terms with a last condition. I would need water from your Well of Urdr.

Id: [0x0028E97A]
We'll get the Church to see to it, Stowe.

Id: [0x0028E97B]
No, no it should be me. I must ready him for judgment.

Id: [0x0028E97D]
I understand. Only get some air from time to time. It reeks in here.

Id: [0x0028E97E]
Shall we, Broga?

Id: [0x0028E97F]
It's the skeletal remains of a place of worship, just a stone-skip away.

Id: [0x0028E984]
A church, heavens no! Mithras was a pagan idea, a so-called god beloved by the ancient soldiers that built this city.

Id: [0x0028E986]
This Temple is our only strong lead. I would like to see it.

Id: [0x00291CDF]
How do I look? Half-drowned and half-burnt?

Id: [0x00291CF9]
I did. I saw a wave of Saxons appear in the heart of Grantebridge as if by magic. Odd as wings on an eel.

Id: [0x00291CFA]
A piercing question. Hm. I believe it means that Soma will lead me to greatness, however difficult. That she is linked to my destiny.

Id: [0x00291CFB]
I left my clan to pursue my vision. I don't remember much. The sacred plants addled my memory. But I was hungry for more visions.

Id: [0x00291CFC]
Was it yellow? I don't recall. You could ask Lif. He's our shipmaster.

Id: [0x00291D00]
You return.

Id: [0x00291D03]
I should be going.

Id: [0x00291D04]
I should be going.

I believe there's a chance that it was you.

There you are, snake-tongue.

There you are, snake-tongue.

Id: [0x00294BE6]
All right, time to go. Norway to England takes about a week by longship, so I'll scrub ahead.

Id: [0x00294BE7]
Layla? You okay?

Id: [0x00294BE8]
Sorry. Can you play the message again?

Id: [0x00294BE9]
We have the transcript if you're looking for something. I can go and--

Id: [0x00294BEA]
No, I wanna hear it.

Id: [0x00294BEB]
Okay…

Id: [0x00294BEC]
I don't mean to be cryptic, it's just…

Id: [0x00294BED]
So those bones out there are the only lead we have … our only chance at fixing this planet before it's too late.

Id: [0x00294BEE]
Here it is.

Id: [0x00294BEF]
I lived, I died, and now I sleep. And in my sleep, I dream. And in my dreams, I see an end to the doom that will grip the earth once again. Find the Wolf-Kissed, find the Mad One, find me, and save us all from another death.

Id: [0x00294BF0]
Unsettling, that is.

Id: [0x00294BF1]
Okay. I'm ready.

Id: [0x00294BF8]
Not just I, the kindness of bandits and strange Britons. He embraces Christ and Cernunnos alike.

In Lunden, it seems The Compass is the head. The Arrow and The Leech are his hands.

Id: [0x00294C06]
I'd bet my knuckles he's the one sowing discord among the Danes that shelter in Lunden.

Id: [0x00294C07]
If it were me, I'd hide among my ranks. Surrounded by other fighting men.

Id: [0x00294C0A]
That's at the Coliseum. A test of skill they're calling it. But you can't just walk in. You need an invitation.

Id: [0x00294C11]
Tewdwr? The boy has the head of a mule. You taught him reason?

Id: [0x00294C18]
I like to know who I'm killing.

Id: [0x00294C1D]
You got a coin? Show me? Is that a coin? For the archery contest?

Id: [0x00294C1E]
He goes by "The Arrow", I'm told. A fit name for a keen archer. Can't wait to meet the man himself.

Id: [0x00294C23]
A perfect strike!

Id: [0x00294C24]
A cheat! A cheat!

Id: [0x00294C25]
You can always forfeit if you're not having fun!

Id: [0x00294C30]
Guards! At arms!

Id: [0x00294C34]
Eivor! We're at the door!

Id: [0x00294C35]
Eh? Who the fuck are you?

Id: [0x00294C3F]
And Eivor … don't drop your guard around these docks.

Id: [0x00294C4A]
I was working in the shipyards. Next thing I knew the city was burning from the inside. Then Soma led our retreat.

Id: [0x00294C4E]
I do. But I follow them. It's my duty to this clan, to my jarlskona. A man's honor comes from his acts, not his wishes.

Id: [0x00294C51]
Aye. And yellow's not an easy pigment to mix, let alone acquire. I was furious it was stolen.

Id: [0x00294C56]
Did you? It was stolen from my workshop not long ago.

Id: [0x00294C5A]
If being honorable were easy, we'd have no evil men. It is something I … I wanted, sure. But I am a man of honor above all.

Id: [0x00294C60]
You insult me, Eivor. The night Grantebridge fell, I was working. In the shipyards.

Id: [0x00294C62]
I could already hear fighting by the time Soma gathered me to retreat. I was nowhere near where the Saxons came in.

Id: [0x00294C65]
You brew up stories better than anything I've tasted in any meadhall, Eivor! I don't have time for this insolence.

Id: [0x00294C6D]
You told me you often disagree with Soma's orders.

How did you feel when Guthrum named Soma the steward of Grantebridge and not you?

Id: [0x00294CBC]
Aye, get rid of it then. And tell no one of this.

Id: [0x00294CC0]
The sands will run backwards now. Without her, we'll return to balancing humors.

Id: [0x00294CC4]
You wouldn't know it was ever broken.

Id: [0x00294CC7]
I have a mind to burn that bloody tome. Is that the right call?

The Order, eh? I'd need more testament than your word alone.

Id: [0x00294CDF]
Flinched! At a torch, like she's some sort of witch.

Id: [0x00294CE0]
Haven't you seen the burn scars? Lost her whole clan to the flame.

Id: [0x00294CE6]
Keep off, boy-o. This is my coin, my shot. You want one, you talk to my mate Hussa, and he'll point you true.

Id: [0x00294CE8]
I heard the take for this job is three stubs of silver a month. Is that true?

Id: [0x00294CE9]
Ja. And they pay you more if you drag your brothers into it. Hussa's earned a fortune skimming the docks of Lundenwic.

Id: [0x00294CF5]
Begone, you reek of someplace else.

Id: [0x00294CF8]
I haven't come this far trusting any old sellsword on the street.

Id: [0x00294CF9]
How do I know you aren't some rat looking to sink our ship?

Id: [0x00294CFB]
Did he now? And what's our common friend's name?

Id: [0x00294CFE]
I have a bow and a body ready to serve The Arrow. So why turn away the sharpest eye in Britain?

Ah, I knew he was soft. Not like my other girl. She was hard as hog's breath, that one.

Id: [0x00294D1A]
I'm keeping him safe. Had a fear he was being followed.

Id: [0x00294D1B]
I'm keeping him safe. Had a fear he was being followed.

Id: [0x00294D20]
Hussa did? Well, he's a keen one, all right. Has a good eye for soldiers.

Id: [0x00294D21]
Take this coin. It will give you entry at the coliseum. Welcome to The Arrow's kinship. With luck, you will gain rank.

Id: [0x00294D25]
But, do you align with our values? What think you of outlanders?

Id: [0x00294D26]
Hussa sent me. Your man in Lundenwic.

Id: [0x00294D27]
Hussa sent me. Your man in Lundenwic.

A poor showing. Such a pity.

Id: [0x00294D5E]
This contest is private. Invitation only.

Id: [0x00294D5F]
Not at all. I was only reflecting on my visions. Wondering at them … how present they are, like memories of yesterday.

Id: [0x00294D63]
All right.

Id: [0x00294D64]
All right.

And once we've found The Arrow, this order needs to know we'll be after The Leech and The Compass as well.

Id: [0x00294D87]
I've heard whispers. Somewhere here, a man gives you a coin. And this coin grants you entry to a contest run by The Arrow's men.

Id: [0x00294D8D]
Which man? I see too many here.

Maybe not, but I'm not saying shit until I hear something that makes me believe you are who you claim.

Id: [0x00294DB9]
It is not your place to demand things of The Order.

Id: [0x00294DBA]
It's not your place to demand things of The Order.

Id: [0x00294DE8]
I see. And you have these orders from Halfdan in writing, yes? From the great man himself?

Id: [0x00294DEA]
Yes, you answer to Halfdan. And now he orders one final strike on the Pict stronghold at Magnis.

Id: [0x00294DEE]
To make war with the North on such a scale will require a hefty amount of silver and a large force of men.

Having trouble keeping up?

Want a trial round to test your eye?

Id: [0x002951F0]
It's enough to keep us talking. But I'll want to see how well you handle that bow before you go any further.

Id: [0x002951FA]
It was a fair shot, carry on!

Id: [0x002951FD]
Tyr is pragmatic, and it serves him well. You should heed him more often.

I can't. I have a tribute for your father.

Then comes the second great sorrow…

Id: [0x0029FEFD]
The prophecies of the Nornir are as clear as daylight. The Aesir are doomed. All Asgard is doomed.

Not this! Further along … the foretelling of a wolf, a great beast.

And my part. What about me?

And falls to Fenrir! It's there you see? You have foretold my death. Your Havi will die.

And falls to Fenrir! It's there you see? You have foretold my death. Your Havi will die.

Id: [0x002A0EC8]
We speak what we see.

Id: [0x002A0EC9]
Have you gleaned enough, O Wise One?

Id: [0x002A0ECF]
I'm no string to be plucked or tied! I am the High One, the Lord of Ecstasy, the Enemy of the Wolf. I am eternal.

A brood mare who preys on innocents, and you brag about strength.

How did the night of the attack play out, from your view?

Id: [0x002A0FAB]
How did the night of the attack play out, from your view?

Id: [0x002A0FAF]
Buri's balls! We are Asgardians! We don't skulk around like elves. We fight!

Id: [0x002A0FB0]
We are fighting! For our homes, for our people. But some problems can't be solved with the hard end of a hammer!

Id: [0x002A0FB2]
Havi! Break our stalemate.

Id: [0x002A0FB4]
Warriors from Jotunheim! They attack from all fronts.

Id: [0x002A0FB5]
While we sit on our trembling hands and scratch our bums!

Id: [0x002A0FB6]
Not so, Thor. Many Aesir have been sent to the four corners of Asgard, leaving we four to defend the Great Hall.

Id: [0x002A0FB7]
Havi! Lend me a score of your warriors and I will lead them into Jotunheim myself!

Id: [0x002A0FBA]
I would bring them here to hold the Great Hall itself. This invasion is too large to spread ourselves around.

Id: [0x002A0FBB]
What is this, another invasion?

Id: [0x002A0FBC]
What's this, another invasion?

Id: [0x002A0FC0]
O! O! Desist, you foul Dane! Guards! O, woe unto me! Put me down!

Id: [0x002A0FC4]
I fear everything these days … in small doses.

Id: [0x002A0FC7]
Rouse every warrior who can hold axe or hammer! We're hunting Jotnar (giants) heads!

Id: [0x002A0FF1]
Friends, brethren, good people of Lunden!

Id: [0x002A0FF3]
Tryggr, my friend, my leader. Slaughtered like a dog! By outsiders, by the enemy!

Id: [0x002A0FF4]
They think we're safe! But, our Governor knew. He confided in me his real plans to protect Lunden.

Id: [0x002A0FF5]
The drunken Danes of Northumbria polluting the north. Aelfred and his men of Wessex rallying to the south.

Id: [0x002A0FF6]
Of all this, Tryggr said, "Avgos, what we need now are strong borders and stronger soldiers."

Id: [0x002A0FF7]
Today, I honor that wish. I present to you, good people of Lunden, our new elite archery force.

Id: [0x002A0FFA]
And further, until these storms of accusations clear, I will take Tryggr's place at the head of our fair city.

Id: [0x002A0FFB]
Not that I could replace him, for Tryggr was a pillar of steel. But I can try. Let me be your arrow, let me point a true way forward.

Id: [0x002A0FFD]
Me? By whose order?

Id: [0x002A0FFE]
Me? By whose order?

Id: [0x002A1008]
It's not an easy choice to make. But I will choose with care, I promise.

Id: [0x002A1009]
It's not an easy choice to make. But I will choose with care, I promise.

Id: [0x002A1014]
Were any creatures among the Jotnar? Draugr? Trolls … or wolves?

Id: [0x002A101C]
I'm with you, Havi. Let the Bifrost shimmer with the blood of their dead.

Id: [0x002A1026]
That's good to hear

Id: [0x002A1027]
That's good to hear

Id: [0x002A1028]
I surprised myself, to be honest. But I felt it would be a good test of God's faith in my judgment.

Id: [0x002A102A]
Well then, I thank you, for what it's worth. God go with you.

Id: [0x002A102B]
Quite a gambit, bishop. Mad enough to work, it may be.

Heavy guard for a musty crypt. It cannot be the dead they're protecting.

I hope that's enough for you, Eivor, because we're finished here.

Id: [0x002A1066]
Well, you're not the regular Sunbeam I've come to know. Something weighing on you?

Id: [0x002A106B]
Mama!

Id: [0x002A1070]
Draw strings! First wave, fire!

Id: [0x002A1071]
I was arrow for their rage. Without a foe to consume, we devour ourselves.

Id: [0x002A1081]
What happened the night of the attack?

Id: [0x002A1082]
What happened the night of the attack?

Id: [0x002A1097]
If this order can corrupt Lunden's favored saint, what hope do we have?

Id: [0x002A1099]
The people were at peace. A beautiful night, fog and all. Then came the Saxons, all around, and Soma roaring like a great bear.

Id: [0x002A109F]
The burning of the Harvest King. It is a momentous occasion for many here.

Id: [0x002A10A1]
Like the Christ, he sacrifices himself for his people. So that they may prosper.

Id: [0x002A10A2]
But this is an empty platter for your gods. Hungry bellies are known to retaliate.

He's good at blending in, I haven't spotted him yet today.

Id: [0x002A10AD]
Eivor … what was your impression of Erke?

Id: [0x002A10AF]
Let the flame be set. May the crop be abundant!

Id: [0x002A10B2]
It must ache to serve under someone you love so deeply, one who doesn't love you back.

Time to go, my lord. We're late for the crowning ceremony.

Id: [0x002A10C0]
Then I will oversee, as is my right, my blood.

Id: [0x002A10C2]
Mother saw your fate. The future will punish you greater than I ever could.

Id: [0x002A10C4]
Mother Modron.

Id: [0x002A10C8]
I took Modron from you. You have every right to feud with my line. Once you're old enough to hold a sword.

The pagans of Glowecestre are my people, just as the children of Christ are.

Strong as iron.

And our alliance?

I found your things packed for a long journey. Were you planning to travel?

Id: [0x002A10D5]
I found your things packed for a long journey. Were you planning to travel?

Id: [0x002A10DC]
Some days, the pain hits hard. I need to press my hand into my heart to keep it from digging through my chest.

Id: [0x002A10E3]
No, I stayed. I'm happier near Soma with a broken heart than far away with a heart still longing.

Id: [0x002A10E5]
I don't know. Whoever killed Tryggr was a close friend. And it was Erke who found the body.

Id: [0x002A10E6]
I know Erke so well. And I can't bear to think he'd do something so vile, but…

Id: [0x002A10E8]
You suspect him of something?

Id: [0x002A10E9]
You suspect him of something?

Id: [0x002A10EF]
You were a smuggler. Some would say that's not a trustworthy past.

Id: [0x002A10F0]
You were a smuggler. Some would say that's not a trustworthy past.

Id: [0x002A10F1]
And water is wet, what a surprise. I'm an opportunist. I see a chance, I take it. It's helped Soma so far.

Id: [0x002A10F3]
She knows what I am, what I was. But she trusts me. Who would better know the difference between a joke and the truth?

Id: [0x002A10F7]
You know him better than me. If you suspect him, only say the word.

Id: [0x002A10F8]
You know him better than me. If you suspect him, only say the word.

Id: [0x002A10FC]
Erke was torn up by the Good Sister's dark dealings.

Id: [0x002A10FD]
Erke was torn up by the Good Sister's dark dealings.

I don't know him well, but a guilty man doesn't have a clean conscience like his.

Id: [0x002A10FF]
I do not know him well, but a guilty man doesn't have a clean conscience like his.

Id: [0x002A1103]
Erke has been a great help. Why doubt him now?

Id: [0x002A1104]
Erke has been a great help. Why doubt him now?

Id: [0x002A1105]
No, no. I believe in Erke. It's me I don't trust. I feel unfit for my post some days.

Id: [0x002A110D]
Forgive me. My latest thoughts have been restless.

Id: [0x002A110E]
I've been a reeve (sheriff) for so long, fighting for God's justice. I shed my earthly attachments for his great plans. But…

Id: [0x002A1111]
No. No, I'm not sure I could.

Id: [0x002A1112]
But you couldn't shed Erke and his friendship?

Id: [0x002A1113]
But you could not shed Erke and his friendship?

Id: [0x002A1118]
When she called a retreat, we ran for the longboats, aiming to regroup in the swamps. It was an ambush, no more, no less.

Id: [0x002A1119]
I was drinking under the noses of dozens that night. I would never betray my people.

Id: [0x002A111B]
We're done here. And it'd be good for your health to take a walk, away from me.

Id: [0x002A111E]
So. What does this lead to?

Id: [0x002A111F]
So. What does this lead to?

Id: [0x002A1121]

Id: [0x002A1125]
Yes, indeed. And thank you for listening.

It's good to talk, unburden your soul. Clears the mind and lifts a weight off the chest.

I'll return to Saint Paul's just down the road. Godspeed, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A1130]
I should find one of these coins soon. Will you be around?

Id: [0x002A1131]
I should find one of these coins soon. Will you be around?

Id: [0x002A1136]
You fight at my side, yet think me a spark of animal in a human skin? I know I am a dedicated woman. It's a pity you don't.

Id: [0x002A1139]
I am to be Tewdwr of a united land. I can no longer turn my eye from anything.

Id: [0x002A11AB]
Well fought, friend. I would not have survived this ambush without you.

Id: [0x002A1224]
And my beloved Gisele's scolding. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A122E]
Your land has plenty of healing remedies if you know where to look. I'll find you something.

Id: [0x002A1246]
Why is my cup empty?

Id: [0x002A1247]
Perhaps because you have drunk the barrel dry?

Id: [0x002A1248]
You would say that, Eadred. Your wife acts like a sow in a skirt.

Id: [0x002A1273]
So they say! She's an old place, and surly as they come. But there's a mystery here I quite adore.

Id: [0x002A128E]
Neither, High One. I am only a tool. One with hopes to be well used.

Id: [0x002A1293]
To balm my bruised ego, I'll admit. The Jotnar did not appreciate my skills and crafts.

Id: [0x002A1295]
Was it wrong to believe you and your kin possess a wisdom beyond measure and could recognize such a rare opportunity?

Id: [0x002A1296]
And you thought we in Asgard might?

Id: [0x002A1297]
And you thought we in Asgard might?

Id: [0x002A1299]
A demonstration, yes. And if he fails to impress … we hoist his skin as a sail.

Id: [0x002A129A]
What do you know of our sacred well?

Id: [0x002A129B]
It's a place of great power and vital magic. A source of spirit. It's the water there that will power your shield.

Id: [0x002A12A1]
I'm called The Builder by most.

Id: [0x002A12A2]
If I have another name, it's not within my memory. Builder it's been for as long as I've been … building things.

Id: [0x002A12A3]
I work with stone, wood, metals, whatever is at hand. And I finish by infusing my work with subtle charms and wishes.

Id: [0x002A12A5]
O, for a time, for a time. But you and I both know, the Jotnar are a dull and desperate race.

Id: [0x002A12A6]
Did the Jotnar benefit from these charms and wishes?

Id: [0x002A12A7]
Did the Jotnar benefit from these charms and wishes?

We will recover the longboat tomorrow. I will not leave it to the muck.

Id: [0x002A12B1]
When a thought enters your head, you're not afraid to take the plunge!

Id: [0x002A12D2]
Ubba Ragnarsson has come. He claims to have some business with you.

Id: [0x002A12D6]
For that, be thankful I do not kill you where you stand.

Id: [0x002A12D7]
You did your brother justice by coming here. But you are beaten. I suggest you leave.

She carries the weight of leadership on one shoulder and the bonds of her people on the other.

Id: [0x002A1363]
Yet she is unburdened now. Lighter. She is a leader, not a friend, Eivor. Her mistake was thinking she could be both.

Id: [0x002A1364]
Now that she's lost one, she walks lopsided. It will take years of toil to rebuild those bonds with her people.

Did you see anything odd when the attack began?

Id: [0x002A1385]
I fled a harrowing attack, cutting down Saxons and praying a Valkyrie would take my men when they fell.

Id: [0x002A138A]
You pick at me like a scab. And I won't have it. Be happy I don't strike you down for adding a sour note to my battle song.

Id: [0x002A138C]
You saw me near death in the fens, clinging to this life, and still you question me?

Id: [0x002A138D]
Keep searching for lies and you will be cursed for it. Now go.

Id: [0x002A1399]
Perhaps you should move out of the way, atop that rock? The view will be much better.

Id: [0x002A139C]
The visions you've had about you and Soma, how do you interpret them?

Id: [0x002A139D]
The visions you've had about you and Soma, how do you interpret them?

Id: [0x002A139F]
You may not understand. But Soma does. She knows the gods have a plan for me and that following it is worth any risk.

Id: [0x002A13A0]
Why were you at death's door when Soma found you?

Id: [0x002A13A1]
Why were you at death's door when Soma found you?

When you have pacified the place, I'll meet you there. What a mess all this has become. What a terrible mess.

The supplies are destroyed. The cargo is ours. I'm headed to Wesberie now to join Ivarr and Ceolbert.

Some. Have no fear.

Some. Have no fear.

No one left to save you!

Id: [0x002A3F15]
Where's your silver? Where!

Id: [0x002A3F16]
Let me go!

Id: [0x002A3F17]
My children? Where are you?

Id: [0x002A3F18]
It's that damned Norse!

Id: [0x002A3F1A]
Forward, forward!

Id: [0x002A3F1B]
Kill them all!

Id: [0x002A3F1F]
Vicelin's dead!

Id: [0x002A3F20]
Relent! Relent!

Id: [0x002A3F24]
Huh?

Id: [0x002A3F26]
Wake up.

Id: [0x002A3F27]
Wake up.

Id: [0x002A3F28]
Where is Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002A3F29]
Where is Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002A3F2A]
Burn it to the ground!

Id: [0x002A3F2B]
(Laugh)

Id: [0x002A3F32]
We surrender!

Id: [0x002A3F33]
Please! No more. No more!

Id: [0x002A3F3E]
Yes, I've found Stowe, and he's found me, and … and here we are … together.

Id: [0x002A3F40]
It's about time you found each other. Stopped tiptoeing around it.

My brother saw him last.

Id: [0x002A3F60]
(snore)

Id: [0x002A3F63]
Celebrating the peace. Got started early.

Id: [0x002A3F65]
Drunk as a mackerel, isn't he?

Id: [0x002A3F66]
Drunk as a mackerel, isn't he?

Id: [0x002A3F67]
Did none of you see Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002A3F68]
Did none of you see Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002A3F6A]
Only him, drengr. You will have to wait until he sleeps it off.

Id: [0x002A3F7D]
Keep this to yourself, but once or twice when I needed a quick word … I dumped him in a lake.

Id: [0x002A3F7E]
Does he often get this soaked?

Id: [0x002A3F7F]
Does he often get this soaked?

Id: [0x002A3F82]
A few hours should do it. Unless you find another way to rouse him.

Id: [0x002A3F83]
How long before he's fit to speak, would you say?

Id: [0x002A3F84]
How long before he's fit to speak, would you say?

Id: [0x002A3F86]
It's worth a try.

Id: [0x002A3F87]
It's worth a try.

Id: [0x002A3F8A]
By all the gods, he does! Twice a week. Once for three days, another for four. And twice on Sundays.

Id: [0x002A3F8C]
And when you need him to sober up, what do you do?

Id: [0x002A3F8D]

That drunken lout should be awake by now.

That drunken lout should be awake by now.

Id: [0x002A3F9A]
Ah! Ah! By Odin and Thor, it's freezing!

Id: [0x002A3FA0]
That's a low thing to do to a man! Ach!

Id: [0x002A3FA2]
I am looking for Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002A3FA3]
I am looking for Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002A3FA4]
Hmmm? [Smacking his lips]What country is this?

Id: [0x002A3FA5]
Lunden stands!

Id: [0x002A3FAC]
They might have. And I'll serve penance before God, but I will not feel shame. Not ever.

Id: [0x002A3FAD]
Times being what they are, Elska, I'd rather not join Tryggr among the headless.

Id: [0x002A3FAE]
Be cautious with that. Anyone could've walked in.

Id: [0x002A3FAF]
Be cautious with that. Anyone could've walked in.

Id: [0x002A3FB1]
They're fleeing!

Id: [0x002A3FB6]
I've heard the shouts. The deaths of Avgos and Frideswid have angered many.

Id: [0x002A3FB7]
I don't doubt it. But are we ready for him?

Id: [0x002A3FB9]
Have you stepped out today? There's a strange feeling brewing in the streets.

Id: [0x002A3FBA]
Have you stepped out today? There's a strange feeling brewing in the streets.

Id: [0x002A3FBC]
You make a well timed point.

Id: [0x002A3FBD]
You make a well timed point.

Id: [0x002A3FBF]
We'll be waiting.

Id: [0x002A3FC0]
I have more to do first. I will be back.

Id: [0x002A3FC1]
I have more to do first. I'll be back.

Id: [0x002A3FC5]
Tryggr was killed and dismembered by men who worked for him, men he trusted.

Id: [0x002A3FC6]
Avgos, The Arrow. Our brother in arms. He wanted Lunden for The Order.

Id: [0x002A3FC9]
And the Good Sister. That's another knife to the back.

Id: [0x002A3FCA]
Lunden's Saint, Sister Frideswid. She was The Leech and the city was her meat market.

Id: [0x002A3FCB]
Your bishop has already issued an apology on behalf of the Church.

Id: [0x002A3FCE]
Let us go over all that's happened up 'til now.

Id: [0x002A3FCF]
Let's go over all that's happened up 'til now.

It is time we focused on The Compass. Gather all we know and lay it out, plain as day.

It's time we focused on The Compass. Gather all we know and lay it out, plain as day.

Id: [0x002A3FD7]
Are you ready?

Id: [0x002A3FDA]
We know The Compass is a sailor, a captain from Francia.

Id: [0x002A3FDB]
And he won't like hearing he's got a leak in his hull, so to speak.

Id: [0x002A3FE6]
Burn in your Hell, you bloody reeves!

Id: [0x002A3FE8]
We're penned in!

Id: [0x002A3FEB]
The tower! There's an open window they can't have reached.

Id: [0x002A3FF1]
Is there another way out?

Id: [0x002A3FF2]
Is there another way out?

Id: [0x002A3FF3]
I'll go up! You find a way out!

Id: [0x002A3FF4]
I'll go up! You find a way out!

Id: [0x002A3FF6]
A nice nap?

Id: [0x002A3FFD]
You're not welcome here. I've had enough trouble with Danes today.

Id: [0x002A3FFF]
It was him what caused the ruckus! Him and that other one were here, talking to Thegn Geadric.

Id: [0x002A4000]
Are you the alewife here?

Id: [0x002A4001]
Are you the alewife here?

Id: [0x002A4002]
I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm looking for my brother, a large Norseman.

Id: [0x002A4003]
I'm not here to cause trouble. I'm looking for my brother, a large Norseman.

Id: [0x002A4006]
Soldiers on alert. What's happened here?

Id: [0x002A4007]
Soldiers on alert. What has happened here?

Id: [0x002A400A]
These soldiers are tightly wound.

Id: [0x002A400B]
These soldiers are tightly wound.

Id: [0x002A4011]
Hm. What's it worth to ye to find out?

Id: [0x002A4012]
Which way did my brother go?

Id: [0x002A4013]
Which way did my brother go?

Id: [0x002A401A]
Thieving cotter. Here's your silver.

You are risking your life, and I'm the one who'll take it.

Id: [0x002A4024]
You are risking your life, and I'm the one who'll take it.

Go on ahead. I'll catch up with all of you soon.

Id: [0x002A41B7]
Go on ahead. I'll catch up with all of you soon.

Id: [0x002A41C2]
Right, then! Station filled, flock shepherded. And off to Tryggr we go!

Id: [0x002A41C5]
Take me to your governor, Stowe. He sounds like a man worth knowing.

Id: [0x002A41ED]
You risk your life, Aelfred King.

Id: [0x002A41EE]
You risk your life, Aelfred King.

Id: [0x002A41FB]
Brother!

Id: [0x002A41FC]
Brother!

Id: [0x002A4200]
Cast aside your cares in Valhalla. Let seeking go, we have earned our joy. The journey is complete!

Id: [0x002A4209]
The Compass.

Id: [0x002A420B]
If we commandeered the springalds that Avgos built, we could rain a cloud of arrows on the invaders.

Id: [0x002A4214]
You seem to respect this man Geadric. If he was talking to my brother, it's because he wants what's best for this shire.

Id: [0x002A4215]
You seem to respect this man Geadric. If he was talking to my brother, it's because he wants what's best for this shire.

Id: [0x002A421E]
Whatever happens, this ends tonight.

Id: [0x002A421F]
May God guide our swords and cover our backs.

Id: [0x002A4220]
I'll see you when it's done, Erke. Count on it.

Id: [0x002A4248]
Ealhferth, may your roof shield me.

Id: [0x002A425B]
My brother, that's what.

Id: [0x002A4261]
Time's up for your scout, I'd say. He's either dead or run off.

Id: [0x002A4265]
Come Havi! Tonight we drink and swive! But now's the hour we prove our might!

Id: [0x002A427F]
You've exhausted my friend Ubba here, but I'm wide awake. Maybe tell me where Burgred's hiding and let him rest happy.

Stone-faced and tight-lipped, all for a king who hides like a cowardly vole, too scared to protect his family and his people.

Stone-faced and tight-lipped, all for a king who hides like a cowardly vole, too scared to protect his family and his people.

Id: [0x002A42A7]
You're right, you are. Your brother and his friend jumped through that window there, and scampered off towards the river.

Id: [0x002A42A8]
Such a woman would help me find Geadric's friends.

Id: [0x002A42A9]
Such a woman would help me find Geadric's friends.

Id: [0x002A42AB]
Thank you kindly. Your brother and his friend jumped through that window and ran for the river.

Id: [0x002A42C3]
It took three arrows to kill him. The next twelve were an insult.

Id: [0x002A42C5]
I just arrived. The killers left a letter on the body there.

Id: [0x002A42D6]
Must've been what was used to free Tryggr's head from his neck.

I don't understand! They should be dead! Hold them off while I try to restore it!

Your shield is failing, Builder! They're passing through!

Id: [0x002A42E2]

The fools. They run towards their doom.

This is not what you promised!

This is not what you promised!

Id: [0x002A42EA]
Get their attention and draw them hither!

Id: [0x002A42F4]
We've come for the woman, Fulke. She need not bedevil you any longer.

Id: [0x002A42FD]
Take me to your governor, Stowe. He sounds like a man worth knowing.

Id: [0x002A4301]
God, no! No, no, no!

Id: [0x002A4302]
Let's go!

Id: [0x002A4303]
Fresh air!

Id: [0x002A430F]
He's hiding. At the summit of the hill. I can smell him.

Id: [0x002A4311]
Wigmund! I want to see the light leave your eyes!

Id: [0x002A4314]
Wigmund! Die for all you've taken from me!

Id: [0x002A431B]
You'll die in agony, bacraut (asshole)!

Id: [0x002A431C]
You can't kill me, Soma! Not truly. For what I am is unkillable!

Id: [0x002A4320]
Stop flapping your mouth and DIE!

Id: [0x002A4321]
Stop flapping your mouth and DIE!

Id: [0x002A4322]
We should return to camp. Before I let go, and burn this heap to the ground.

Id: [0x002A4342]
My palms itch. Where is that rat?

Id: [0x002A4343]
I taste Wigmund's fear on the air. My fingers itch for his life, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A4345]
Patience. I'll attack when it's time.

Id: [0x002A4346]
Patience. I'll attack when it's time.

She means well. I don't believe she would poison you, not willingly.

She means well. I don't believe she would poison you, not willingly.

Id: [0x002A44DB]
Drink the rest.

Id: [0x002A44E0]
Her soothing herbs lift the fog from my mind, for a time.

Id: [0x002A44E4]
You're stalling, Eivor. Tell me what you've learned. What news from the North?

Id: [0x002A457C]

Was God's lesson instructive?

Id: [0x002A4596]
My God is the Almighty. But my enemies are numerous and my throne is fresh. There must be no trail from these murders back to me.

Id: [0x002A4599]
Goodwin was following the clues given in this letter when he disappeared.

Id: [0x002A4679]
If Birstan does not return soon, wine will not be the only thing spilled upon his floors.

I'm with you, Havi. Let's deal out some punishment.

He's made the base already? The Builder works fast. A bit too fast.

Id: [0x002A46E3]

Quite the sight, isn't it? Not even dwarves work at such a speed.

He's built the tower base already! How does he labor so swiftly?

A Dane who gives alms to the righteous. I … I bless you, and pray for your wayward soul. Take this key.

Id: [0x002A4718]
This will make a fine space for my work, Eivor. Thank you.

Id: [0x002A4726]
I'll collect the water, Havi. Keep this one clear of our sacred sites.

Id: [0x002A473E]
Change has come, Burgred. All that remains is a coronation. A witan with the lords of Mercia.

Id: [0x002A477F]
I see. I'm Soma, Lord of Grantebridge. Though it seems an order of lunatics wishes to strip me of that title.

Id: [0x002A478F]
Fell ill a few days back. So I sent her to the Good Sister Frideswid. Healer in town.

Id: [0x002A4795]
You make a fine point. Let me pray on this.

Id: [0x002A47AE]
Take what you need, and do it quickly. We should not linger.

Id: [0x002A47BC]
Your sight is clear and your mind is sharp. Let that guide your thinking in the days to come.

Id: [0x002A47C1]
Vili departs for Kinder Downfall soon. Ride with him. And talk, like old friends made new.

Id: [0x002A47E3]
Is he taunting me!

Id: [0x002A4847]
You're certainly a better hunter than you are a diplomat, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A484C]
That ceased their prattling! A fine outcome, Eivor. The very soul of balance.

Id: [0x002A484E]
I spend my effort where it matters most.

I am sorry for your loss.

I am sorry for your loss.

Id: [0x002A4870]

Such a grisly fate. Did you know Ealhferth?

Id: [0x002A48F8]

A sad day for Wincestre.

Id: [0x002A48FE]
No, but I plan to write an epic poem of his grisly demise. O, poor Ealhferth, scorched of face. All your woeful companions, bold byrnied (armored), weeping, weeping as you are … er…

A pity.

Id: [0x002A4947]
The bishop is dead, that's certain. And if the bishop was The Seax, The Seax is dead. A transitive property of mortality, you see?

Are you sure The Seax is dead?

Aelfred is busy with the Ealdormen of Wessex. A witan was lately called to discuss the little matter of a bishop's timely death.

Id: [0x002A4956]
All in good time. A witan has been called to deal with our dead bishop. When this business is done, Aelfred will shower you with silver.

A reward will ease my hurt. As much silver as a longship can carry.

You bastard Dane! You're as bad as them. I only ever wanted to serve God.

Id: [0x002A4A76]
That you did. But do not mistake necessity for friendship.

[POEM HERE]Your reign will end, King of the West Saxons. Raven wings will beat until your throne crumbles to dust.

Ceolwulf is a Mercian doing his best to find common footing in this new land. Seems to be the only true Mercian by my reckoning.

He stabbed you in the back, true. But the people of Mercia are scared, and Ceolwulf offers them a balm for that fear.

Id: [0x002A4AF7]
I spit on him! Whatever life he makes in Mercia will be built on the graves of the nobles who gave their lives to defend it.

Id: [0x002A4AF8]
Felt pretty stable after a while.

Id: [0x002A4AF9]
Right. Even when we win, we lose.

Mummy, my stomach hurts!

It's only a cough! On the braids of Freyja, I swear I'm fit to go home.

Id: [0x002A4B0A]
(singing)

Id: [0x002A4B0B]
She's confined herself to her study for so many days and nights. Up to some strange alchemy there.

Id: [0x002A4B0C]
You don't imply the Devil's work, I pray? The Good Sister speaks to God alone.

Id: [0x002A4B0E]
The Good Sister, Frideswid.

The Good Sister, Frideswid.

Lay down your arms, free my friend here, and kiss my lordly feet. You will not get a second chance.

Id: [0x002A4B1B]
We've taken Repton, Tamworth. Now Templebrough and Ledecestre. With each victory, your hope for peace recedes.

Id: [0x002A4B1C]
Were you behind this, you dishonorable Truth-Tangler!

Id: [0x002A4B1D]
You're a fine one to talk of sexual appetites. You fathered a wolf cub!

Id: [0x002A4B1E]
I'll not hear a lecture from the Lord of Petty Rules, who stiffens at the thought of laying down the law!

Id: [0x002A4B1F]
And before you threaten to brandish your hammer, Thor, remember … without it, you'd be no better than a troll, only twice as stupid.

Id: [0x002A4B23]
It's a simple contest here. Hit all targets true before the sand runs down!

Id: [0x002A4B24]
Here's a new competitor. A Norse from the northern wilds of Mercia.

Id: [0x002A4B25]
And, our current reigning champion: Saer.

Id: [0x002A4B2F]
Cowards! Open this door and face us!

Id: [0x002A4B30]
That's only a taste of the hellfire you'll see!

Id: [0x002A4B31]
Eivor, we're still inside!

Id: [0x002A4B48]
Go ahead, then. They're all set up.

Id: [0x002A4B49]
I will shoot a practice round, just to be sure.

Id: [0x002A4B4A]
I'll shoot a practice round, just to be sure.

Id: [0x002A4B4C]
A real fanatic, you are. Get ready…

Id: [0x002A4B4D]
I've had enough practice. Let us begin.

Id: [0x002A4B4E]
I've had enough practice. Let's begin.

Id: [0x002A4B50]
Why bother me at all then?

Id: [0x002A4B51]
I do not have time for this. Maybe later.

Id: [0x002A4B52]
I don't have time for this. Maybe later.

You've got a good racket here. Cutting my purse strings for a few more arrows.

Id: [0x002A4B5C]
Well, the conditions on your matches weren't exactly the same.

Id: [0x002A4B5D]
With the Arrow looking for the best archer in Lunden, you would best be sure.

Id: [0x002A4B5E]

Let's loosen those arrows! Targets up! Bows ready!

Id: [0x002A4B65]
We are at the mountain's peak, Soma. With room for one alone. So I claim this summit, jarlskona. I claim Grantebridge.

Id: [0x002A4B69]
You fucking rodent, Galinn. It was you. You let those Saxon insects into our home. You betrayed us!

Id: [0x002A4B6A]
It was preordained, Soma. Like the sunset, like the birds' flight.

Id: [0x002A4B6D]
Were you watching my feed? What the hell was all that?

Id: [0x002A4B70]
Desmond.

Id: [0x002A4B72]
Desmond? Wh-what about him…?

Id: [0x002A4B75]
He was like a … I don't know, like a singularity. You know? A vanishing point. All of human history seemed to converge on him.

Id: [0x002A4B76]
In 2012, the sun threw off a mass coronal ejection so large, it should have wrecked all life on earth.

Id: [0x002A4B77]
I remember. I worked at Abstergo then.

Id: [0x002A4B78]
It was Desmond who saved us. He knew how to stop it.

Id: [0x002A4B79]
Abstergo claimed credit for that. Something about their satellite network.

Id: [0x002A4B7A]
That's bullshit. It was Desmond. He pulled the switch that saved the world.

Id: [0x002A4B7B]
But that switch is still on. Still generating a magnetic field, one that's growing stronger every day.

Id: [0x002A4B7C]
The temple Eivor found … that's where the field originates.

Id: [0x002A4B7E]
Exactly. And it's been running for eight years, getting stronger and stronger. It will be dangerous now. Heat, radiation.

Id: [0x002A4B7F]
Doesn't matter. We have to fix it. Shut it down.

Id: [0x002A4B80]
No, no no, slow it down. It's still protecting us.

Id: [0x002A4B82]
All of this is starting to make sense. Everything I've done, everything I have learned. It led me here, to this moment.

Id: [0x002A4B83]
You'll need the staff for this one. For protection. Otherwise, you won't make it past the first gate.

Id: [0x002A4B86]
And I'll contact our ship. It can be in Boston Harbor by tomorrow night.

Id: [0x002A4B8D]
Saer leads to victory!

Id: [0x002A4B8F]
Odin's beard! Did you see that!

Id: [0x002A4B91]
Incredible!

Id: [0x002A4B94]
Alright, take your mark!

Id: [0x002A4B98]
We're halfway down the sand!

Id: [0x002A4B9C]
Time! Bows down!

Id: [0x002A4B9D]
Eivor leads to victory!

Id: [0x002A4BB3]
Follow me to the ramparts, Eivor!

Id: [0x002A4BB8]
You have your sibling in the bloodspring at your mercy. How could you waste your family so easily?

Id: [0x002A4BB9]
You coward. You let an innocent die in your place.

Id: [0x002A4BBA]
You coward. You let an innocent die in your place.

Id: [0x002A4BEF]
Easy, dear. You're delirious. Let the Good Sister fix you right up.

Id: [0x002A4BF0]
I don't want to die in here! I'm bound for better things!

Id: [0x002A4BF1]
You're not going to die, my dear. Have patience. We'll patch you up.

Id: [0x002A4BF6]
God go with you, Sister Frideswid.

Id: [0x002A4BF7]
And with you, child.

The springalds are close!

Id: [0x002A4C60]
We should all follow her example in our devotion to Him.

Id: [0x002A4CE1]
Ah, The Leech is bled out. And did you catch a name?

Id: [0x002A4CE3]
What? The Good Sister? That can't be right. She was a saint. A healer and a…

Id: [0x002A4CE4]
Gods. That brick fits this week's wall of shit.

Id: [0x002A4CE5]
A nun, name of Frideswid.

Id: [0x002A4CE6]
A nun, name of Frideswid.

Id: [0x002A4CE8]
Not every problem has a clean solution.

Id: [0x002A4CEA]
This was her fix. All her ideas and discoveries written here. Ill-gotten gains.

Id: [0x002A4CF1]
That's deadly aim you have. Best I've seen for some time.

Id: [0x002A4CF2]
Well shot.

Id: [0x002A4CF3]
Haul yourself to the Imperial Arch and speak with our man, Hussa.

Id: [0x002A4D06]
No mercy this time, Wolf-Kissed. You spared that wet turd, Leofrith. We will not spare Rhodri.

Id: [0x002A4D0D]
I swear.

Id: [0x002A4D0E]
I swear.

Whether I am or not, I am the one you'll speak with. Randvi tells me you are … merchants?

You I do not recognize, my friend. What brings you to settle here? Are you merchants?

The Arrow hasn't got any friends, only pupils. Stay here among the crowd.

A friend of The Arrow.

Id: [0x002A4D1F]
A friend of The Arrow.

Id: [0x002A4D21]
And May the Mother of Wisdom Give us Strength.

Id: [0x002A4D22]
You're to stand just there. Look your best when The Arrow comes forth. And keep still.

May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Ja, and who's asking?

Are you Hussa?

Id: [0x002A4D2B]
Are you Hussa?

Id: [0x002A4D2D]
I often say the same. And it always costs me a little fortune.

Id: [0x002A4D2E]
Wait. I can do better.

Id: [0x002A4D2F]
Wait. I can do better.

Id: [0x002A4D31]
If that's the case, then Saer will meet The Arrow, uncontested.

Id: [0x002A4D33]
I lost in a fair contest. It is not worth grousing over.

Id: [0x002A4D34]
I lost in a fair contest. It's not worth grousing over.

Bear up, love, The Good Sister will see that you feel better.

Id: [0x002A4E72]
I should not expect you do. When we first arrived, I noted a shadow of suspicion in your eyes. A doubt, a wariness.

Id: [0x002A4E7A]
A violent struggle between nobles and bandits. The bandits did not fare so well.

Okay. We're good.

Id: [0x002A4EBD]
I don't know what happened, but I can work around it. You'll have to pick a stream to keep things stable.

Id: [0x002A4EC7]
I've got enough to go on for now. Erke and Stowe must see all this.

Ach, no. Tryggr's your fellow. I'm the shire reeve (sheriff) of Lunden's westerly half. I keep things ordered and fair.

I'll have dealings with any who can deliver a fair friendship with my Raven Clan. If that is you, then all the better.

Right then, you've some dealings with Governor Tryggr, was that it?

Id: [0x002A5536]
Eivor. I'm honored you have joined us.

Id: [0x002A5539]
All the shire supports Soma ruling the city. These hamlets do not. They're feeding and outfitting Wigmund's army.

Id: [0x002A5540]
Lif, he's a talented sailor. If a little … enthusiastic. And Birna, well…

Id: [0x002A5547]
I was climbing a mountain, a lion and a snake upon my back, weighing me down.

Id: [0x002A554E]
When we reached the peak, there was hardly enough room to stand.

Id: [0x002A559E]
We're ridding the world of a priest who spouts praise for the ealdorman, and funnels tithes into Wigmund's coffers.

Id: [0x002A55A5]
Good fortune for her! When Soma took hold, the silver started flowing, and the people started dancing. She knows trade.

Id: [0x002A55A6]
I do wish I had been bold enough to put myself forward, to take on the burden and honor of running a city.

Id: [0x002A55B8]
Patience and love. I know each of our vessels as a parent knows their child. But building ships needs silver too.

Id: [0x002A55C1]
Eivor! A fine day for being out, no?

Id: [0x002A55C8]
Good conversation, Lif. Now, let's take down Wigmund's man.

Id: [0x002A55C9]

As a master shipbuilder, what does your work require?

Id: [0x002A55EE]
Eivor, my muscle-banded friend! There's a nest of Wigmund's men just here. We're going to pick it clean.

Id: [0x002A55FE]
When Soma took me in, she saw more than a smuggler in me. I was useful to something greater than myself. Useful to her vision.

Id: [0x002A5602]
O, Lif's got that raw animal pull. Every time I see him, I want him to climb me like a tree and nest in my armpit.

Id: [0x002A5603]
He brays about being honorable, but I've never met a man of honor who starts a fire just to be praised for putting it out.

Id: [0x002A5608]
You and I should take a closer look. My men will hang back and come running if things go sideways.

Id: [0x002A560F]
If I knew what was going on in another person's head, I'd find life dreadful and dull. But Soma seems to enjoy my company.

Id: [0x002A5611]
Her own way. Just not in the way I'd like.

Id: [0x002A5617]
I'd been in England for ages, before Guthrum, Ivarr, Ubba … smuggling under the eyes of Saxons and Danes alike.

Id: [0x002A5619]
I lied, stole, had my nose broken. Life wasn't easy, but it taught me how to bear the pain. I just laughed it away.

Id: [0x002A562C]
What do you think of Soma's other warriors, Galinn and Lif?

Id: [0x002A562D]

Are we your friends, Dane?

Id: [0x002A564A]
After years of blood and gore, looting and burning, forgive us if we don't trust a Dane.

Id: [0x002A564C]
Friends, peace. I was told you might know where the Britons bring in their supplies.

Id: [0x002A564D]
Friends, peace. I was told you might know where the Britons bring in their supplies.

I would have it so.

I would have it so.

Id: [0x002A5681]
What you say is good sense. Very well, Dane. Here's what I know.

Id: [0x002A5682]
In Rhodri we share a common enemy. My only wish is to destroy his supply line and bring him to the table, begging for a truce.

Ah, Eivor. We have missed your wit on the Jorvik council.

Id: [0x002A57CF]
Where is your king, Saxon? Where is he?

Id: [0x002A57D1]
Lord our Father, grant me salvation--

Id: [0x002A57D6]
When does their God find the time to answer so much mumbling and whimpering?

Id: [0x002A57D7]
It's up to you.

You're reckless, Ivarr! Ceolbert could have been killed.

Id: [0x002A57DA]
You're reckless, Ivarr! Ceolbert could have been killed.

Id: [0x002A57E5]
Good, Eivor … I would not lead you blindly into the unknown. Have faith that what I know is true, and where we go is real.

Id: [0x002A57E6]
We have come a long, long way in search of a hazy vision, Sigurd. Be careful.

You should know … you are not alone in this. I too have had visions.

No, no. My visions began long before Fulke. Before England even. And it was Basim who told me to heed them.

Id: [0x002A5800]
This ordeal with the Elf King, Aelfred. How far have you pushed him? Does he bend? Will he break?

Id: [0x002A5801]
The Christians are hardy foes. They see one man above who holds the axe. One man higher than us all. That is a powerful fuel.

Id: [0x002A5803]
The woman, Fulke … in my time with her, as painful as it was … she showed me things.

Id: [0x002A5805]
We hold our own axe. We swing it where we may.

Id: [0x002A5809]
Even the mad ones can offer wisdom. Their Jesus was an odd fellow. Now half the known world loves him.

Id: [0x002A580A]
Not even my father.

Id: [0x002A5810]
Don't excuse yourself. You enjoy this too much.

Id: [0x002A5811]
Don't excuse yourself. You enjoy this too much.

Id: [0x002A5817]
Will you not stay, Wolf-Kissed? There is no king, but we have corpses to loot!

Id: [0x002A5820]
No. Forget all that. The future is forward. A great wealth awaits us.

Id: [0x002A5845]
Now a hundred or more Saxons know the smell of it.

Farewell, Brother.

Farewell, Brother.

Id: [0x002A58C6]
The spirit of a dwarf in the body of a goat?

Id: [0x002A58C7]
The spirit of a dwarf in the body of a goat?

Id: [0x002A58C8]
Stranger still, his sister didn't even notice!

Id: [0x002A58CA]
We should go. Look at him.

Id: [0x002A58CB]
We should go. Look at him.

Id: [0x002A58D1]
S-Sigurd…?

Id: [0x002A58E9]
You gutless worm. Slayer of my kin. Oath-breaker, spirit-taker! I didn't build this tower to keep your enemies out.

Id: [0x002A58ED]
I will finish the inscription. Builder, you stay with me. You others, go.

Id: [0x002A58EE]
I will finish the inscription. Builder, you stay with me. You others, go.

Id: [0x002A58F6]
Havi!

Id: [0x002A58F9]
Don't drag me into this.

Id: [0x002A58FA]
The tower is nearly finished!

Id: [0x002A58FB]
My son … Eivor … by Odin's blessing! Come and let me look at you both!

Id: [0x002A5900]
This … this calls for a toast! Your journey must have been long and cold. A drink to warm your blood!

Id: [0x002A590A]
Not fast enough. I feel the jaws of a trap closing upon me.

Id: [0x002A590C]
You don't care if I'm married off to this Builder, do you?

Id: [0x002A590D]
Do not fret. The final hours are ticking down.

Id: [0x002A590E]
Do not fret. The final hours are ticking down.

Knowing you are in a trap is the first step to avoiding it.

Id: [0x002A5910]
Knowing you are in a trap is the first step to avoiding it.

Id: [0x002A5913]
Yet you act as if I'm some treasure to be traded about.

Id: [0x002A5918]
You are the Queen of Asgard, the Host of Folkvangr, the shepherd-of-the-slain. Of course I care.

Id: [0x002A5919]
You are the Queen of Asgard, the Host of Folkvangr, the shepherd-of-the-slain. Of course I care.

It was your right to pledge your crown to another. And I know you did what you thought best, for the safety of our clan.

There was nothing sensible about your betrayal. Sigurd should have been king. You robbed him of that.

Id: [0x002A5926]
There was nothing sensible about your betrayal. Sigurd should have been king. You robbed him of that.

Id: [0x002A5928]
And what have you done with yourself since? Drink heavily and weep for what might have been?

Id: [0x002A5929]
And what have you done with yourself since? Drink heavily and weep for what might have been?

Id: [0x002A592C]
Mad Deceiver, I should neuter you and make you his bride!

Id: [0x002A592F]
It doesn't worry me. He wouldn't live beyond his wedding night. You'd see to that.

Id: [0x002A5930]
It does not worry me. He would not live beyond his wedding night. You would see to that.

Id: [0x002A5936]
Once the Builder is dealt with, turn your spear on Loki. Every chance he had, he dug us deeper into this mess.

Id: [0x002A5938]
I was wrong to use you like that. I'll confront the Builder and pry the truth out of him.

Id: [0x002A5939]
I was wrong to use you like that. I will confront the Builder and pry the truth out of him.

If Loki is up to something, I'll see to it that he's punished, blood-oath be damned.

Id: [0x002A593D]
At least have the sense to admit you betrayed my trust!

Have no fear, Freyja. Whatever things transpire today, you marrying the Builder will not be among them.

Id: [0x002A593F]
Have no fear, Freyja. Whatever things transpire today, you marrying the Builder will not be among them.

Id: [0x002A5940]
Lady Aethelswith, I see Burgred has done his best to hide you away. But what is lost must always be found.

Id: [0x002A5951]
And did you take my scout, Olav, in that battle? Your brother in arms? Did he, too, have to die for this tribute?

Id: [0x002A59DE]
They only took their rightful share.

Id: [0x002A59E9]
A mettle not unlike your own!

Id: [0x002A5A2C]
Ha! Your weapon strikes true!

Id: [0x002A5A30]
Do not let them charge you!

Id: [0x002A5A31]
Gets the blood coursing!

Id: [0x002A5A4F]
One rune remains, which I shall inscribe after I am wed.

Id: [0x002A5A51]
Our agreement said nothing about outside help. Now, where is Freyja? I tire of waiting.

Id: [0x002A5A54]
Why does she leer so wickedly?

Id: [0x002A5A55]
Who helped you complete the work, Builder? You could not have managed so quickly on your own.

Id: [0x002A5A56]

It's worth knocking on a few doors, that's all I'm saying!

Id: [0x002A5A5B]
Tryggr wasn't killed because you want to plant a few trees and fix a few roofs in Lunden!

Id: [0x002A5A65]
Our destination is there.

Id: [0x002A5A66]
It is not a tool we use against our enemies, but an act we embrace to strengthen our resolve.

Id: [0x002A5A67]
You see? My faith proved stronger than my fear!

Id: [0x002A5A70]
Norway is your home, but not necessarily your destiny. You need to separate the two before you see clearly.

Id: [0x002A5A72]
No, life is complicated. Only death is simple.

Id: [0x002A5A73]
Why can I not bring myself to leave Norway, Valka? Is it my fate to remain or my fear that keeps me here?

Id: [0x002A5A74]

Id: [0x002A5A7C]
Has this sad spectacle been for my sake alone? I've seen better drama on the festering carcass of a dead pig.

Id: [0x002A5AAA]
Looks less like a meal for crows in here.

Id: [0x002A5AAB]
Looks less like a meal for crows in here.

Id: [0x002A5AB1]
Impressive enough to join?

Id: [0x002A5AB3]
Indeed. Let us hope we both land on the same side.

Id: [0x002A5AB4]
Your army is impressive.

Id: [0x002A5AB5]
Your army is impressive.

Id: [0x002A5AB6]
No, not today. But who can say where fate will fling us?

Id: [0x002A5AB7]
No, not today. But who can say where fate will fling us?

Id: [0x002A5AB9]
Look at us sitting on our laurels, while Eivor does all the work.

Id: [0x002A5ABA]
I can't make head or foot of all this. I just … I just can't.

Id: [0x002A5ABF]
You three, scurry!

Id: [0x002A5AC3]
No Freyja, no shield.

Id: [0x002A5AC6]
To Helheim with him, Havi! I know where he keeps his enchanted paint.

Id: [0x002A5ACC]
Finish your work. Or suffer.

Id: [0x002A5ACD]
Finish your work. Or suffer.

Id: [0x002A5ACE]
Show me.

Id: [0x002A5ACF]
Show me.

Id: [0x002A5AD0]
Thor, Tyr, watch our guest closely. Freyja … I hope we will have words when this is done.

Id: [0x002A5AD1]
Thor, Tyr, watch our guest closely. Freyja … I hope we'll have words when this is done.

Id: [0x002A5AE0]
Eivor. Have we not said our farewells?

Id: [0x002A5AE2]
You were filled with vengeance for so long it has left you hollow. And now, you seek to fill it with loyalty to Sigurd.

Id: [0x002A5AE3]
Hello … Father.

Id: [0x002A5AE4]
Hello … Father.

Id: [0x002A5AE5]
We have … I just … I would like you to know that all that I do, I do for Sigurd.

Id: [0x002A5AE6]
We have … I just … I would like you to know that all that I do, I do for Sigurd.

Id: [0x002A5AF4]
How goes your plan? Have you managed to find a coin for the contest?

Id: [0x002A5B57]
My child … my dear child. I only did what I thought was best. You must know that.

Id: [0x002A5B58]
It is me, old man.

Id: [0x002A5B59]
It is me, old man.

War is never far from my mind, King Harald. But I have no quarrel with you.

I come to speak of Styrbjorn. Of a man I call father and friend.

I come to speak of Styrbjorn. Of a man I call father and friend.

Id: [0x002A5B70]
I will do what I can for the man, for he has been a loyal retainer. But there is only so much I can do. A man must care for himself.

Id: [0x002A5B73]
I want to ask, that in his dying days, you will tend to him. With respect. With honor. And see that he dies with dignity.

Id: [0x002A5B74]

Rhodri! I see you mocking me! I challenge you! Single combat. Now!

Id: [0x002A5B7E]
You survived my trap. How disappointing.

Id: [0x002A5B80]
Buri's ballsack! Can I kill him now?

Id: [0x002A5B81]
My hugr makes it work. I am bound to it through the magic of your realm.

Id: [0x002A5B83]
Well reasoned. They should call you the God of Hindsight. All-knowing after the fact.

Id: [0x002A5B88]
Invaders from Jotunheim. We slaughtered them all.

Id: [0x002A5B89]

Id: [0x002A5B8E]
(groaning)

Id: [0x002A5B91]
Boneless Ivarr. Spineless, toothless, gutless. You cannot kill me! A dragon will be my death as my seers have foretold!

Id: [0x002A5B92]
And your brother? Does your destiny guard him?

Id: [0x002A5B94]
Gwriad!

Id: [0x002A5B95]
By God Almighty, I'll--

Id: [0x002A5B96]
Get them to safety. Go! Quickly!

Id: [0x002A5B98]
Kill the Boneless one! Paint this chapel with his blood!

Id: [0x002A5BA1]
Ivarr, no!

Id: [0x002A5BAB]
Eivor, we want to apologize. We'd no idea what we were doing, or why.

Id: [0x002A5BAC]
But Stowe got us sorted out. We're glad he gave us another chance.

Id: [0x002A5BB5]
Stowe's letter said to meet him at Saint Paul's.

Id: [0x002A5BB6]
Stowe's letter said to meet him at Saint Paul's.

Id: [0x002A5BBC]
Hectic. Thrilling. Hard. The fire gave us a good excuse to make repairs all across the city.

Id: [0x002A5BBD]
How has it been since I last saw you?

Id: [0x002A5BBE]
How has it been since I last saw you?

Id: [0x002A5BC3]
Stowe gave me work manning the springalds, no thanks to you.

Id: [0x002A5BCA]
I wake every morning, and if I am lucky, there's a moment where I forget.

Id: [0x002A5BCE]
Carry on with your life, Mae. Everything will be all right.

Carry on with your life, Mae. Everything will be all right.

Oswald of Elmenham, first of his name, the rightful King of East Anglia … with his Lady Valdis, soul, fist, and beauty of this land.

Id: [0x002A5C18]
Wolf-Kissed! Gaze upon my pots. They stand so strong! Unbreakable at this distance, no?

Id: [0x002A5C1B]
Too festive! And too soon. Fires, fights, and every man soaked in mead.

Id: [0x002A5C21]
Ugh! This has gone too far.

Id: [0x002A5C43]
They are not, Brothir. My arrows shatter whatever target they strike.

Id: [0x002A5C44]
They are not, Brothir. My arrows shatter whatever target they strike.

Id: [0x002A5C4A]
Even after draining so much mead? Succeed and you shall be rewarded!

Id: [0x002A5C52]
Surely, a special kind of mettle is required for drinking before the new king.

Id: [0x002A5C53]

Id: [0x002A5CB6]
My longship's in Valhalla! Or don't you remember, Fire-Starter?

They like to say he moves with mystery.

Id: [0x002A5CBC]
They like to say he moves with mystery.

Id: [0x002A5CBD]
Come on. Let's get you to solid ground.

Id: [0x002A5CBE]
Come on. Let's get you to solid ground.

Id: [0x002A5CC5]
Hm! Everything's spinny.

Id: [0x002A5CCB]
The Saxon god wanders somewhere up here, does he not? I haven't seen him.

Id: [0x002A5CE6]
Seems like the Saxons didn't get all of Rollo's clan.

Id: [0x002A5CE7]
Seems like the Saxons didn't get all of Rollo's clan.

Id: [0x002A5CED]
Wemba is always here. Helping the sleeping. Singing to them, so they are not frightened before they meet God.

Id: [0x002A5CEF]
Have you seen Leof? My poor friend. Poor, poor Leof.

Id: [0x002A5CF1]
You don't mourn like they do.

Id: [0x002A5CF2]
You do not mourn like they do.

Id: [0x002A5CF3]
The sleeping? You mean the dead?

A peasant's clothes? Strange discovery in a churchyard.

Id: [0x002A5D00]
Let my handmaidens walk free of this place. They have nothing to do with our quarrel.

Id: [0x002A5D17]
That's not a compliment, Eivor. That's just alarming.

Id: [0x002A5D19]
She looks good, Stowe. Good enough to attract a hoard of Vikings.

Id: [0x002A5D1A]
She looks good, Stowe. Good enough to attract a hoard of Vikings.

But it keeps your back straight and your sword at the ready.

But it keeps your back straight and your sword at the ready.

Id: [0x002A5D20]
It's over and done, thank the Spinners.

Id: [0x002A5D21]
Find us for a drink sometime, eh, Broga?

Id: [0x002A5D22]
You're a fearless warrior, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A5D23]
Just as Erke says … a real broga.

Id: [0x002A5D38]
Have caution, boy. Until your father is crowned, you're Mercia's enemy, not its champion. You understand?

Id: [0x002A5D39]
Have caution, boy. Until your father is crowned, you're Mercia's enemy, not its champion. You understand?

Id: [0x002A5D3B]
Aye. And I'm not too comforted by the sight of you wielding weapons like a war chief. We're a hospice, not a barracks.

Id: [0x002A5D3C]
Confession grants atoned death. Failure to confess earns a disgraceful death.

Id: [0x002A5D3D]
Guards, protect me!

Id: [0x002A5D46]
Come sup with us later, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A5D47]
Till then, I'll attend to the injured.

Id: [0x002A5D48]
I must be off to handle this mess.

Id: [0x002A5D49]
We'll talk more when all is done.

Id: [0x002A5D6A]
Selwyn? That bastard said I stole an apple. He'll see me hang for it!

Id: [0x002A5D6B]
I am looking for the reeve (sheriff).

Id: [0x002A5D6C]

Loki … did you know this Builder before we met him at Heimdall's tower?

Id: [0x002A5D7A]
Loki … did you know this Builder before we met him at Heimdall's tower?

Id: [0x002A5D7D]
Make this right, Loki. Or the blood-oath that binds me is forfeit. For you and your son, is that clear?

Id: [0x002A5D7E]
Make this right, Loki. Or the blood-oath that binds me is forfeit. For you and your son, is that clear?

Id: [0x002A5D85]
He is! God's kept his spirits and health up. He's waiting for me back at the Governor's villa.

Id: [0x002A5D86]
How is Erke? Is he well?

Id: [0x002A5D87]
How is Erke? Is he well?

Id: [0x002A5D92]
You shall. We want to show you the result of all your aid.

Id: [0x002A5D94]
I would like to say hello.

Id: [0x002A5D95]
I'd like to say hello.

Id: [0x002A5D96]
Good. Lead on.

Id: [0x002A5D97]
Good. Lead on.

Id: [0x002A5D99]
Still the best shot in Lunden, I am!

Id: [0x002A5DA5]
Have you spotted something?

Id: [0x002A5DA6]
Not yet, but let us go ahead to clear the path of any dangers. Then follow our lead when the sun brushes the horizon.

Id: [0x002A5DB2]
Sail on.

Id: [0x002A5DB6]
Look ahead there. Is that what passes for a town? Plain brick and a single rune to their timid god?

Id: [0x002A5DB7]
That cross killed their Christ, and now they display it in worship! Bizarre.

Id: [0x002A5DB8]
But we do not worship the wolf that kills him! That is the difference.

Id: [0x002A5DB9]
Whatever strangeness we see in these Saxons, they must think the same of us.

Id: [0x002A5DBB]
It must be priests and worshippers alone in that place. We could storm this port with ease, sack it without breaking a sweat.

Id: [0x002A5DBD]
Later, Dag. There will be time enough for raiding once we have settled.

Id: [0x002A5DE2]
My Regna, my poor girl, is dead. But, she is avenged. Thanks to you.

Id: [0x002A5DE5]
You still hear of some ruffians and thieves eager to fill the gap left by The Orders' leaving.

Id: [0x002A5DE6]
But on the whole, it's been quiet.

Id: [0x002A5DE8]
Yes, you've never come across as one to walk the easy road.

Id: [0x002A5DEC]
Quiet. That is good to hear. Doesn't describe my days and years.

Id: [0x002A5DED]
Quiet. That is good to hear. Doesn't describe my days and years.

Id: [0x002A5DEE]
True. Too much silence might drive me mad.

Id: [0x002A5DEF]
True. Too much silence might drive me mad.

Id: [0x002A5DF2]
This is a sacred place. Killing here is forbidden, you know this Havi.

Id: [0x002A5DF5]
Out of my way, Tyr. I'll suffer no wolves in Asgard!

Id: [0x002A5DF6]
Out of my way, Tyr. I'll suffer no wolves in Asgard!

Id: [0x002A5DF7]
Easy now!

Id: [0x002A5DF8]
Have patience, all!

Id: [0x002A5DF9]
The Nornir still spun for us, my Stowe. We've many years yet. Come on!

Aye, Odin saw me as too handsome for his hall.

It's a good feeling, isn't it?

And we did it, together.

Tryggr would've killed you for pilfering bricks from the Mithras ruins, no matter how vile that place was.

I did not find it, Eivor. I chose it … the only way forward that did not lead to more violence and death and grief.

Id: [0x002A6827]
Well, that was not as smooth as I had hoped, but the means can be forgiven when the end bears fruit.

Never mind that now! They're coming from all sides!

Ducking and hiding through the rushes. With bow and arrow. Chasing rabbits and squirrels.

Id: [0x002A6E44]
I tried to console him, but he pushed me away.

Id: [0x002A6E45]

Welcome to my estate, old friend.

Id: [0x002A7335]
My trading plans are blocked by King Aelfred at every turn. Birstan is a dear friend, but he manages Essexe on whims and frivolity.

Id: [0x002A7337]
A Dane? Now that is fascinating. But we live in interesting times, and I must dance where the Devil pipes his tune.

Id: [0x002A7339]
It is! What an insight. Now please leave me alone before the brightness of your wit blinds me.

Id: [0x002A733A]
You look like a man with a great weight on his mind.

Now, now, take it and come hither. I have a rousing hunt planned for the two of us.

Id: [0x002A7374]
Leave aside talk of politics and shiremoots. Let us enjoy the fruits of my land together.

Id: [0x002A7376]
It's not bravery, it's trust. I trust that the respect I've earned keeps Saxon and Dane alike from temptation.

You're flush with land and crops, to be sure. You're a brave man to flaunt your riches from this lonely hill.

We're hunting or fruit-picking?

Id: [0x002A739A]
We're hunting or fruit-picking?

Id: [0x002A73AA]
We cannot afford such a loss. The einherjar (champions) must hold back to defend our city.

I'll find the trouble before it finds us.

I'm impressed. You are sharp as that axe on your belt.

Back for more, eh? Must have an appetite for punishment.

Ready to try your luck?

Yes, and I'm so pleased you agreed to come! I suspect you know better than most that I have what it takes to lead this shire.

Id: [0x002A7552]
Though its line of kings is all but ended, the people of this land still teems with life, with promise.

Id: [0x002A756F]
Okay, we're all set. Whenever you're ready, you can jump back in.

Id: [0x002A7577]
I beg patience, all! We'll have this wrack cleaned up in no time! Keep it steady.

Id: [0x002A757D]
Here you go, love. Bear up, Master Hamme, you'll be on your way shortly.

It can feel that way, aye.

Id: [0x002A758B]
Can I help you with something?

Id: [0x002A7594]
Ah the governor, Tryggr. A good and fair Dane, come to Lunden four year back.

Id: [0x002A759D]
Most hours of the day, you can find him at the old villa, dealing with all manner of knavery.

Avgos wants his cut of the summer harvest, shit-karl! What's the hold up?

Id: [0x002A75B8]
Gentlemen, the farmers of Mercia have paid their burden already. If Avgos wants more, he can petition for it.

Id: [0x002A75C5]
That belongs to Master Hamme, Sir.

Id: [0x002A75CE]
Petition for it? Well, you can tell that old mud-merchant, that if he wants his apple… He can bob for it.

Id: [0x002A75D3]
Bob for it.

Id: [0x002A75D8]
That is filthy.

Aelfred's man, arrested? Now that's as funny as a dose of the pox. Seems no one is free in Wincestre.

Id: [0x002A76C6]
You dare to arrest the Reeve of Wincestre? You're either extremely bold, or fatally stupid.

Id: [0x002A76D1]
My soldiers and silver are pledged already. I expect the same from you.

This so-called Order are nothing but deviled shit-peddlers.

Your heart is not yet steady.

Ah, good. Your signal's already a little wobbly. Are you inside?

Not yet, but there's a hundred feet of ice above me.

All right, we may lose touch when you push through, so remember what we talked about. Watch your meters carefully, for radiation especially. And keep the staff close.

Well, nearly.

Thanks, Becs.

Id: [0x002A77F2]
Perhaps this aspect of your vision inspires bravery. Truly you are touched by the gods. Was there more?

What are you doing, Eivor? Picking at corpses? Get back on the ship!

Look there, just ahead. Where the Sons of Ragnar make their camp.

Id: [0x002A7851]
At last. To find our feet on steady ground.

Id: [0x002A7852]
No … let us get a closer look.

Id: [0x002A7855]
We should proceed on foot, lest they spot the boats.

Id: [0x002A785C]
I say we go back, Sigurd. Give those dogs a good knock-around and take whatever treasures they have. Easy pickings.

Id: [0x002A785E]
Not today, Dag. We press on until we reach our goal. We cannot afford another surprise.

Id: [0x002A785F]
Now be on your guard. It should not be far.

Free me! I'm no use here, not with the wind gone from my sails.

Id: [0x002A7958]
That's Birna, for sure. If my head was in a bucket of water, I'd still know.

Id: [0x002A7993]
That it's foolish to search the Fenlands for so few people.

Id: [0x002A7996]
Not at all.

Id: [0x002A7998]
You have the look of one who does well with solitude. You're alone, a wanderer. It may be you think of soldiers as war fodder, and little else.

Id: [0x002A7999]
What must I think?

Id: [0x002A799A]
What must I think?

Id: [0x002A79F3]
It's through Tryggr I met Erke, and now we reeves walk the city like parents looking after our children. A native son and an imported Dane, see? Lunden's a city built of many pieces.

Id: [0x002A7A00]
And what can I call you. Humbler of Thugs? Dane-hammer?

Id: [0x002A7A02]
Well, I owe you a great debt, Eivor. You're a worthy ally.

Id: [0x002A7A03]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan. We have a settlement to the north, just off the river Nene.

Id: [0x002A7A16]
Ah! Seventy-five thousand years, what's another millennium or two.

Id: [0x002A7A17]
It's getting hotter already.

Id: [0x002A7A18]
Yes, by our reckoning, it's gonna go up by about sixteen degrees Celsius.

Id: [0x002A7A19]
How does it draw so much power?

Id: [0x002A7A1A]
Tectonics is our best theory. The movements of the earth's crust, the churning lava beneath. Huge source of energy.

Id: [0x002A7A1B]
That's tech humans should have. Energy, not pieces of Eden.

Id: [0x002A7A1C]
Well, when all this is over, we could get a start-up going. You know? Get a little workspace, buy a van. Just the three of us.

Id: [0x002A7A1D]
Shit, you're breaking up, Shaun.

Id: [0x002A7A1E]
[distorted]Say-- say that again, please. You're breaking up.

Id: [0x002A7A1F]
Forget it. I'll call you when I'm topside.

Id: [0x002A7A20]
(inaudible)[Wh- why don't you try calling us when you're top side. Something like that.]

Id: [0x002A7A27]
But your rhythm is clumsy, you'll never outpace me.

Id: [0x002A7A28]
But your rhythm is clumsy, you will never outpace me.

Id: [0x002A7A2A]
It's the weakest attempt I've yet heard to disgrace me.

Id: [0x002A7A2B]
It's the weakest attempt I have yet heard to disgrace me.

Id: [0x002A7A2D]
See, your rhythm's how a fool would attempt to debase me.

Id: [0x002A7A2F]
Ah! You think you can win with rhyme, do you? Well … if you like to rhyme, listen this time.

Id: [0x002A7A30]
I'm very brave, my flyting is grave. I'm not a knave, and it's victory that I really crave.

Id: [0x002A7A31]
Your tongue is fat, you're a sprat, you whine like a little brat, and we are in a spat!

Id: [0x002A7A33]
There has never been so weak an insult as that.

Id: [0x002A7A34]

Id: [0x002A7A3A]
All my life I've not heard of a flyting so flat.

Id: [0x002A7A3B]
O, you've made a terrible mistake. Be ready for my finishing blow!

Id: [0x002A7A3C]
I am the best at flyting, I have got powerful skills.

Id: [0x002A7A3D]
I'm strong as an ox and clever as a fox, I'm sharp as a dozen hawks.

Id: [0x002A7A3E]
Let me show you my skills and then you I shall kill … dead, with my … mm … my skill.

Id: [0x002A7A40]
You can stop stumbling over your verses, I've already had more than my fill.

While it's quaint that you think you can best me, I must say … I don't think you will.

Fergal the Faceless or Fergal the Wordless?

Fergal the Faceless or Fergal the Wordless?

Fergal? Hello?

Id: [0x002A7A51]
Fergal? Hello?

Id: [0x002A7A60]
Here we go…

Id: [0x002A7A8A]
It's just like the Animus. It's just like the Animus.

Id: [0x002A7A8E]
That's right! Tire yourself out! Weak little kittens, can't even open one barricaded door!

Id: [0x002A7A8F]
You'll rot in Hell when we're done with you!

Id: [0x002A7A90]
You'll suck my toes when I'm standing on your head!

Id: [0x002A7ADA]
Patience. Ricsige promised an army.

Id: [0x002A7B21]
It does not matter who I was. I am nameless now. I am no one.

Id: [0x002A7B6E]
You'd throw in with these wastrels, these argr (cowardly) swine? For what, a scrap of land and a promise of peace?

Id: [0x002A7B70]
Eivor! No!

Id: [0x002A7B72]
He should be tried before God. A lawful assembly.

Id: [0x002A7B76]
I won't have my reign begin with more blood spilt than is needed.

Id: [0x002A7B7C]
These are Oswald's lands, to rule as king, as he sees fit.

Id: [0x002A7B7D]
These are Oswald's lands, to rule as king, as he sees fit.

Id: [0x002A7B7E]
To defy a king would shame him. East Anglia cannot heal without his honor intact.

To defy a king would shame him. East Anglia cannot heal without his honor intact.

Id: [0x002A7B84]
Another screeching scold.

Id: [0x002A7B85]
Does Eivor bow to kings?

Id: [0x002A7B89]
And what of your honor, Eivor? How much are you willing to lose?

Id: [0x002A7B8F]
Shhh. Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise.

Id: [0x002A7B92]
I solved your riddle. Now all I get is silence? Who am I to meet?

Id: [0x002A7B93]
I solved your riddle. Now all I get is silence? Who am I to meet?

Eivor, please…

The rightful King of East Anglia has spared your life today. And so it will be.

See you in Jorvik.

Fly, my friend, fly. Show Faravid our arses.

Id: [0x002A7BD5]
Fly, my friend, fly. Show Faravid our arses.

Id: [0x002A7BDB]
You grind your heels into the backs of freedmen, not those who deserve it.

Id: [0x002A7BE5]
Best not fall off your horse.

Id: [0x002A7BF7]
Skal!

Skal!

Skal!

Skal!

Id: [0x002A7C01]
It warms my heart that you're concerned, but Hulda and I can hold our drink.

Id: [0x002A7C09]
Faster, Eivor! Ride like Sleipnir's hooves!

Id: [0x002A7C16]
The gods love a fool!

Id: [0x002A7C18]
Your horse is slow, and her rider's drunk.

Id: [0x002A7C19]
Your horse is slow, and her rider's drunk.

Id: [0x002A7C1D]
Come. Our Saxon allies have reached Magnis. We should march.

Id: [0x002A7C27]
I taught little Aelwyn so much more, saved her from a life less worthy. She will find enlightenment in The Order, just as I did.

Id: [0x002A7C2D]
Now, gentlemen, everyone is fractious with this waiting. Let us be civil at least.

Id: [0x002A7C44]
Estrid is a good wife, far better than he deserves.

Id: [0x002A7C8B]
I'll send this to Hytham. He may make some sense of it.

Id: [0x002A7C8C]
I'll send this to Hytham. He may make some sense of it.

Id: [0x002A7CB5]
Hark! To those gathered round, wave your hands and rejoice.

Id: [0x002A7CB7]
The failure Eivor returns. Will you compete again?

Id: [0x002A7CBE]
Good. He is ready.

Id: [0x002A7CBF]
Come you closer, friend Eivor, and lend me your ear.

Id: [0x002A7CC4]
Your body is withered, your garments absurd.

Id: [0x002A7CC9]
Your visage is ghastly, I'm cowed by your stink.

Id: [0x002A7CCE]
You have bested me squarely, and thus won the day.

Id: [0x002A7CCF]
Your pitiful flyting has left me quite cold.

Id: [0x002A7CD0]
I'll happily challenge you … sorry, him.

Id: [0x002A7CD1]
I'll happily challenge you … sorry, him.

Id: [0x002A7CD2]
Not today, this is quite strange.

Not today, this is quite strange.

Id: [0x002A7CD4]
I will.

Never mind.

If this is your best, I've got nothing to fear.

Though you speak through another, your flyting's still poor.

Id: [0x002A7CE1]

You're afflicted with terrible arrogance, but perhaps I am the cure?

You're a simpleton and a fool, and you should never be proud.

Id: [0x002A7CEC]
Erm…

I will easily crush you beneath my thumb.

Uhhh…

You've returned! Do you wish to challenge milady now?

Id: [0x002A7D20]
Once more, you seek an audience with milady?

Id: [0x002A7D23]
How quaint that you think so.

Id: [0x002A7D27]
Hm. A pittance, but I accept on the lady's behalf.

Id: [0x002A7D28]
I have heard much about you and none of it good,<LF>You've the softness and brains of a sheep.

Id: [0x002A7D32]
I should almost take pity on one so bereft,<LF>Of beauty, of wit, and of skill.

Id: [0x002A7D38]
Ha! Ha ha ha. Another peasant falls to the sparkling wit of the Lady Ellette.

Id: [0x002A7D39]
I do.

You're speaking much more than you should.

And it's more than the country can stand.

With respect, this is not the only way the Jotnar can enter Asgard. May I propose a more encompassing solution?

The High One returns. Will you be flyting with me again?

Id: [0x002A7DE6]
I must staunch the flow of invaders.

Id: [0x002A7E2E]
I watched you on your approach. How must it feel not to carry the weight of years?

Id: [0x002A7E2F]
Interested in flyting, then, that I might describe your folly in verse?

Id: [0x002A7E30]
So sad to see how little you've learned from your losses. Will you flyt again?

Id: [0x002A7E38]
You are savage, uncouth, and care little for life.<LF>Like the rest of your kind, you breed mis'ry and strife.

Id: [0x002A7E3D]
It's a shame you're so calloused by warfare and pain.<LF>That you'll joke about death and treat life with disdain.

Id: [0x002A7E42]
Yes, your avarice means that you'll just never see.<LF>That this war will not grant immortality.

Id: [0x002A7E47]
Enough! I have heard more than my fill of your cruelty.

Id: [0x002A7E48]
Terrible work. You are likely better at killing than flyting. I will keep your money.

Id: [0x002A7E49]
I accept. And I'll place a wager on it.

Id: [0x002A7E4A]
I accept. And I'll place a wager on it.

Not now. Perhaps when your mood is brighter.

Id: [0x002A7E4C]
Not now. Perhaps when your mood is brighter.

Id: [0x002A7E4D]
I will. Another wager.

I will. Another wager.

Id: [0x002A7E4F]
Never mind.

Here is my bet. You may begin.

To wear blood is a joy, I'm quite striking in red.

Id: [0x002A9392]
How's that?

Id: [0x002A9395]
How charming! Shall we bet?

Id: [0x002A9396]
For this duel of flyting, intent is reversed.<LF>All rudeness is flatt'ry, a blessing … a curse.

Id: [0x002A9398]
So if you seek to harm me, then simply be kind.

Id: [0x002A9399]
Understood. And thank you for your kind attention.

Id: [0x002A939B]
This I must see for myself.

Id: [0x002A939C]
This I must see for myself.

Id: [0x002A939E]
I was rapt with excitement when you came along.

Id: [0x002A939F]
How rude! That won't work.

Id: [0x002A93A1]
You're skilled with your rhythm, as well as your rhyme.

Id: [0x002A93A2]
You're skilled with your rhythm, as well as your rhyme.

Id: [0x002A93A3]
It's been a true joy to take a moment away from Lunden's troubles and trials. You've more than earned this.

Id: [0x002A93A4]
Remember. In this battle, we strive for kindness.

Id: [0x002A93AC]
That is where I hesitate. Between Lif, Galinn, and Birna, I cannot say. But they are the three who helped me dig this in secret.

Id: [0x002A93AD]
By whom?

Id: [0x002A93AE]
By whom?

Id: [0x002A93B3]
The city was teeming with my men, posted at all gates. Wigmund was shown this tunnel and used it both to enter and escape.

Id: [0x002A93B5]
Wigmund could have escaped in the chaos of the fight.

Id: [0x002A93B6]
Wigmund could have escaped in the chaos of the fight.

Id: [0x002A93BA]
I know I was.

Id: [0x002A93BB]
You believe you were betrayed?

Id: [0x002A93BC]
You believe you were betrayed?

Id: [0x002A93BE]
I hoped you might lend me your wits. You are a fresh ally. I could use your eyes and ears.

Id: [0x002A93BF]
Good. I sent Galinn, Lif, and Birna to destroy what remains of Wigmund's power throughout the shire.

Id: [0x002A93C0]
Meet with them, raid with them, get to know them as best as you can. Find out which of them betrayed me.

Id: [0x002A93C6]
Between you and me, my heart is clouded. I love these three as if we shared a womb.

Id: [0x002A93C9]
I'll do what I can. But you know your warriors far better than I do.

Id: [0x002A93CA]
I'll do what I can. But you know your warriors far better than I do.

Id: [0x002A93CB]
I need clear, sound judgment. I need you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002A93CF]
You have me.

Id: [0x002A93D0]
You have me.

Id: [0x002A93D2]
Too great a risk. This snake could compromise us at any time.

Id: [0x002A93D3]
You could plan your attack and see if it flushes out the traitor.

Id: [0x002A93D4]
You could plan your attack and see if it flushes out the traitor.

Id: [0x002A93D5]
Good!

Id: [0x002A93D7]
I've received a new missive just this morning! It says…

Id: [0x002A93D8]
Ratatosk is the squirrel who here shall run,<LF>On the ash-tree Yggdrasil.

Id: [0x002A93DA]
And the High One is he, who will be crushed,<LF>Underneath my flyting skill.

Id: [0x002A93DC]
What say you, High One?

Id: [0x002A93DD]
Ratatosk, the tree-rat. What message do you carry today?

Id: [0x002A93DE]
Ratatosk, the tree-rat. What message do you carry today?

Id: [0x002A93DF]
I don't blame you. I'd be afraid, as well.

Id: [0x002A93E2]
A betrayal so wicked, I cannot imagine. Yet someone willing to break an oath like that must bear some sign or defect.

Id: [0x002A93E3]

Id: [0x002A93EA]
Looks like Ragnarok itself came for Grantebridge.

Id: [0x002A93F3]
You're a fat-headed fool, and a puny god!

Id: [0x002A93FB]
Tch! You did better than I thought… Now leave this place before I bite!

Id: [0x002A93FE]
Though he fought with some fury and did his best,<LF>It was Havi got the kill.

Id: [0x002A93FF]
Though he fought with some fury and did his best,<LF>It was Havi got the kill.

Id: [0x002A9403]
But they ought call me Knife-Tongue for words so sharp…

Id: [0x002A9406]
"You'll be slain and undone, by my cutting wit…"

Id: [0x002A9407]
I'm a messenger born, and I have got,<LF>A word here from up on-high:

Id: [0x002A940B]
So we will burn their homes, quick and devastating, like the thunderclaps of Thor.

Id: [0x002A940D]
Some will be naysayers. Those who wish to discredit me. And those who wish to keep Lunden weak.

Id: [0x002A940F]
Listen not to them, friends. I serve only Lunden. I serve you.

Id: [0x002A9411]
Lunden is a place of prosperity. Prosperity we must export to all of Britain's kingdoms.

Id: [0x002A9415]
No more false kings with their lies. Heed the ancient ways, the true strength of Lunden.

Id: [0x002A9416]
Rule Lunden. Rule Britain. Rule the world! Into order and truth!

Id: [0x002A9455]
So the plan is this… We sneak in, gut the priest, and return to Soma. That'll get Wigmund steaming.

Id: [0x002A945C]
The fewer lice in the bush, the less itchy the pussycat. That's how I see it.

Id: [0x002A9462]
Cover my retreat!

Id: [0x002A9465]
Heathen eels! Wigmund has gone! He's gone![long evil laugh]

Id: [0x002A9466]
You and Sigurd … you always see eye to eye?

Id: [0x002A946D]
More often than not.

Id: [0x002A946E]
More often than not.

Id: [0x002A9479]
Are you certain?

Id: [0x002A947A]
Don't just stand there, you bloody clots! Kill that one there!

Id: [0x002A9484]
Birna has always been unpredictable. But she's a warrior grown. She does not let her emotions guide her actions.

Id: [0x002A9485]
Unanswered love is a volcanic emotion.

Id: [0x002A9486]
Unanswered love is a volcanic emotion.

Id: [0x002A9487]
An odd time for a fresh coat of paint. But that's his work, is it not?

Id: [0x002A9492]
I'm here aren't I?

Id: [0x002A9494]
Oi, what's this? A mess of filthy Danes befouling our riverways?

Id: [0x002A9495]
You there. Give us your name.

Id: [0x002A9496]
I am Sigurd Jarl of Fornberg. And you are?

Id: [0x002A9497]
You'd best move along, pagan. Spare yourselves a slaughter.

Id: [0x002A9498]
You threaten Norsemen with a play of swords, and expect us to cower?

Id: [0x002A94A4]
Let us not waste any more time.

Id: [0x002A94A5]
Let's not waste any more time.

Id: [0x002A94E4]
Hold! I'll give you anything! The purse at my belt!

Id: [0x002A94E6]
I … I found it?

Id: [0x002A94E8]
How does a rat like you come across so much silver?

Id: [0x002A94E9]
How does a rat like you come across so much silver?

Id: [0x002A94EA]
Fuck off!

Id: [0x002A94EB]
There's someone after me! Help! They be sticking to the shadows!

Id: [0x002A94EC]
Easy there, Alff, another stray dog spook you?

Id: [0x002A94ED]
Have a good amble, Alff?

Id: [0x002A94EE]
I feel like a man renewed. You have yourself a good night.

Id: [0x002A94F2]
Can't this clod walk any faster?

Id: [0x002A94F3]
Can't this clod walk any faster?

Id: [0x002A94F4]
Careful, now.

Id: [0x002A94F5]
Careful, now.

Id: [0x002A94F6]
Is this the place? Or… No. Just meandering.

Id: [0x002A94F7]
Is this the place? Or… No. Just meandering.

Id: [0x002A9516]
Would you lend us your wisdom now, if possible? We are at pains to determine how to deal with the northern Picts.

Id: [0x002A9522]
We fought well, and won. Tomorrow we will fight again. But we must always make time for celebration.

Id: [0x002A9523]
We fought well, and won. Tomorrow we will fight again. But we must always make time for celebration.

Id: [0x002A9542]
Fine. If we falsify orders from Halfdan, Ricsige will accept them. Hjorr of Jorvik could help.

Id: [0x002A9543]
Fine. If we falsify orders from Halfdan, Ricsige will accept them. Hjorr of Jorvik could help.

Id: [0x002A958C]
Yes, we scrape by. With what little we still own. But this new war should make us wealthy once again … until our tribute is taken.

Id: [0x002A95BA]
Northwic. Suffering hard times, I see.

Id: [0x002A95BB]
Northwic. Suffering hard times, I see.

Id: [0x002A95C1]
And this feast is how the Danes prepare their blades?

Id: [0x002A95C3]
Meet iron with iron, that is the way.

Id: [0x002A95C4]
Meet iron with iron, that is the way.

Id: [0x002A95C8]
Nothing at all? That's unusual, Faravid.

Id: [0x002A95C9]
Eivor is mistaken, Lord King. I was given Halfdan's personal assurance that you would volunteer your troops. He expects as much.

Id: [0x002A960C]
But Halfdan is ailing and tired. Let us not burden him with more worry, but please him with a swift victory.

Id: [0x002A961C]
Let's settle this.

Id: [0x002A965B]
Y-yes. In the final reckoning, the wolf Fenrir will be my doom.

Id: [0x002A965C]
Y-yes. In the final reckoning, the wolf Fenrir will be my doom.

Id: [0x002A9668]
Now you know, now you can no longer deceive, tell me … what will you do with him?

Id: [0x002A9688]
How little you know.

Id: [0x002A968C]
Fenrir will be imprisoned until the day of prophecy, when we will meet upon the field of battle. As we are fated to.

Id: [0x002A968D]
Fenrir will be imprisoned until the day of prophecy, when we will meet upon the field of battle. As we are fated to.

Id: [0x002A9691]
Then we will bind you until that day. As you mean to bind our son.

Id: [0x002A9694]
Everything they did was to undermine Aelfred.

Id: [0x002A9695]
Everything they did was to undermine Aelfred.

Id: [0x002A96D0]
It is a different feeling. Warmer, but with less space to stretch my arms and legs.

Id: [0x002A96DB]
The portal opened, and these soldiers came bleeding through. So I sent warning straightaway.

Id: [0x002A96DD]
What's your name, stranger?

Id: [0x002A96DE]
What is your name, stranger?

Id: [0x002A96E1]
Indeed, but among the tenets of our creed is a vow to never reveal too much to outsiders.

Id: [0x002A9712]
Something wrong?

Id: [0x002A9713]
Something wrong?

Id: [0x002A971D]
Is that right, Builder? Are you a gift horse … or a secret curse?

Id: [0x002A971E]
Is that right, Builder? Are you a gift horse … or a secret curse?

Id: [0x002A9756]
Find anything?

Id: [0x002A9757]
Besides enough blood to repaint the city's faded bricks? No.

Id: [0x002A9760]
O, dear…

Id: [0x002A9761]
What is it?

Id: [0x002A9762]
Dirty notes from a mistress … sorry, mistresses. In Tryggr's desk.

Id: [0x002A9763]
O, yes. The old man had a wandering hand and eye.

Id: [0x002A9764]
I didn't know. I didn't think--

Id: [0x002A9765]
He didn't want you to. It was his secret to keep.

Id: [0x002A97A2]
Who's there?

Id: [0x002A97A3]
I'm warning you!

Id: [0x002A97ED]
Hm. Thought that would take 'til the next morn. Let's tie him up and let him rot away.

Id: [0x002A97EF]
Milady! The stumble-tongued Norseperson has returned.

Id: [0x002A97F1]
O, pity this poor little chirpless bird. I will do my best not to harm you too badly this time.

Id: [0x002A97F2]
I'll take your wager before you begin.

Id: [0x002A97FE]
Well, you could pay your respects and see for yourself. The funeral is today.

Id: [0x002A9802]
I don't believe it. Too much theater in Wincestre. Overwrought prayers and wailing women.

Id: [0x002A9803]

Id: [0x002A9805]
If he rots, I will leave with my silver. But if he lives, there's work to be done.

Id: [0x002A9806]
If he rots, I will leave with my silver. But if he lives, there's work to be done.

Id: [0x002A9808]
This time I will not fail.

Id: [0x002A9809]
This time I will not fail.

Id: [0x002A980B]
Based on your appearance, I am thoroughly unsurprised.

Id: [0x002A980C]
I've never heard of her.

Id: [0x002A980D]
I have never heard of her.

Id: [0x002A980E]
Nevertheless, do you wish to challenge her?

Id: [0x002A9835]
Eivor, come to keep your blades sharp?

Id: [0x002A983E]
The silver's for a blacksmith at Bodilsburg Garrison! Oija. I only run errands for the man. I don't know nothing else.

Id: [0x002A9840]
Like I might find a knife at your neck?

Id: [0x002A9841]
Like I might find a knife at your neck?

Id: [0x002A9842]
Put his head on the block. Not mine! Please!

Id: [0x002A984B]
Foolish. Yet to be graced by her presence may balance the pain of the loss you will most assuredly suffer.

Id: [0x002A984C]
Lady Ellette! You are called to the field of flyting!

Id: [0x002A984E]
Very well. Perhaps another day.

Id: [0x002A9855]
Ah, a peasant. Come for a sound flyting? Please. Place your paltry bet.

Id: [0x002A985D]
Go on then. End it.

Id: [0x002A9868]
Where are you? There's no wolf alive I can trust…

Id: [0x002A9869]
Where are you? There's no wolf alive I can trust…

Id: [0x002A9942]
He saved himself and left you to die. All this fighting, it's for nothing. For no one.

Id: [0x002A9943]
He saved himself and left you to die. All this fighting, it's for nothing. For no one.

Id: [0x002A9944]
She will begin.

Id: [0x002A9947]
O you think you're so clever, I'm almost impressed,<LF>That you managed to blurt something out.

Id: [0x002A9949]
Yet I worry our skills are too deeply mismatched…

Id: [0x002A995E]
Simply awful.

Id: [0x002A995F]
Pet names and secret orders, what a crock! Do we know anything we can act on?

Id: [0x002A9964]
Shameful performance. Truly.

Id: [0x002A9967]
I do hope you'll come and try again someday.

Id: [0x002A9969]
Trust me. I will.

Id: [0x002A996A]
Trust me. I will.

Id: [0x002A996B]
My heart weeps for you, and your frailty of mind.

Id: [0x002A9973]
Of course, milady.

Id: [0x002A9974]
Take your winnings. You have earned them.

Id: [0x002A9976]
By the one she was foolish to doubt.

Id: [0x002A9977]
By the one she was foolish to doubt.

Id: [0x002A997C]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002A997D]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002A997E]
Ugh. Pay what is due and send this peasant away. I grow weary.

Id: [0x002A997F]
Eivor, I'm pleased you came.

Id: [0x002A9992]
Here. Faster this way.

Id: [0x002A9993]
Here. Faster this way.

Id: [0x002A9994]
We'll soon be there.

Id: [0x002A9995]

Good boy! Follow their trail!

Id: [0x002A9A5E]
Ah! That's lead. A toxic metal.

Id: [0x002A9A62]
You! All these years, you gifted me poison! You gifted me madness!

Id: [0x002A9A64]
Old friend, please. Your sickness has clouded your judgment.

Id: [0x002A9A66]
This sickness was no accident. I trusted you.

Id: [0x002A9ACB]
Together?

Glory cares not for age, Finnr. Sail with me. My ship could always use a wise head and a strong axe.

Run a brothel they said, spend most of the day lying on your back. Job would be a good 'un without the lusty swains of Essexe.

Come back!

Id: [0x002A9B30]
I understand. The burden of kingship must often be shouldered alone.

Id: [0x002A9B31]
I have known you, Tyr, longer than any in Asgard. And I trust you as a brother. But my present worries, I cannot share.

Far-Seer, you have sight beyond us all. I have no doubt you will prevail over what troubles you.

Strange omens and wild portents. Something evil is stirring. And I cannot always sift the truth from what is false.

Will you face my brother in flyting, Eivor?

Id: [0x002A9B44]
I shall trounce this poor fool without use of my voice.

Id: [0x002A9B45]
Such is his challenge. Do you wish to face him?

Id: [0x002A9B63]
Here you are. My bet.

Here you are. My bet.

Id: [0x002A9B7F]
What about the bishop, Ealhferth? Did you dig his grave?

Id: [0x002A9B80]
No, no. I don't bury a lord in a pauper's husk. Poor Leof, they showed him their gleaming blade.

Id: [0x002A9B81]
Good day. What is your name?

Id: [0x002A9B83]
My brother, however … he is quite proficient.

We kill The Arrow and The Leech, then sit back and wait. Let The Compass come to us.

All but a few will perish in the final battle, we know this. Yet we will die well … and live again in great and glorious tales.

The Nornir told me I would die at Ragnarok. They described the scene of my passing.

Id: [0x002A9BA4]
And I will, as long as breath fills me.

Id: [0x002A9BA5]
I will need your strength in the coming days. To anchor me, to challenge me, to pull me back from the abyss should I teeter.

You can't win this, Leofrith. Even if you defeat me, the Ragnarssons have won the day.

This funeral is a shadow-play. The Order killed an innocent, burned his face so no one could tell, and interred him in Ealhferth's place.

I always put a few coins down as a wager. Most of those who enjoy flyting have an equal fondness for betting.

Id: [0x002A9BF6]
In flyting, it's key to match cadence and rhyme!

Id: [0x002A9BFB]
Now let us examine meaning! Ahem.

Id: [0x002A9C00]
Last one…

Id: [0x002A9C05]
Your flyting's astounding, you're worthy of praise!

Id: [0x002A9C06]
There's still much for you to learn about flyting, but I'm confident you'll pick it up.

Id: [0x002A9C09]
No, not now.

Id: [0x002A9C0A]
No, not now.

Id: [0x002A9C0B]
I would. It may be I'll fare better this time.

Id: [0x002A9C0C]
I would. It may be I will fare better this time.

Id: [0x002A9C4C]
You return! Do you wish to flyt against me now? Come, I can take it.

Id: [0x002A9C5A]
More than strength, I can boast that my features are fair.

Id: [0x002A9C5F]
Have you ever met someone so witty and quick?

Id: [0x002A9C64]
[laugh]Wonderful! Rare to find someone with any flyting skill.

Id: [0x002A9C65]
What a shame. Thought you'd be up for a good spar.

Id: [0x002A9C66]
I do.

Id: [0x002A9C67]
I do.

Id: [0x002A9C68]
Not now.

Quite right! I often get lost swimming to my island in this flowing sea of wheat.

Id: [0x002A9C92]
The most cutting of flyts from my mouth you'll not hear.

Id: [0x002A9C93]
But by proxy, I'll call you a milksop and boor.

Id: [0x002A9C94]
I'll topple you over with nary a word.

Id: [0x002A9C95]
I'm devoted to flyts, though to silence avowed.

Id: [0x002A9C99]
Took care of it? Is he dead?

There was a wolf cub with us, trespassing on sacred ground. But Tyr took care of it.

Id: [0x002A9C9D]
So a last parting phrase: you're as dim as they come.

Id: [0x002A9C9F]
So leave here with speed, once you've paid me your gold.

Id: [0x002A9CA1]
So take what you've earned now and hurry away.

Id: [0x002A9CA2]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002A9CA3]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002A9CA5]
You've bested me. But I'll return.

Where will you go now?

Id: [0x002A9CB5]
Where will you go now?

Id: [0x002A9CB7]
Ah! Many apologies. You are no child, simply a frail and fully-grown fool. Ha ha ha!

Id: [0x002A9CB9]
I know you're a weakling! And you … you need only know my impressive scale and flawless build.

Id: [0x002A9CBB]
We are flyting!

Id: [0x002A9CBD]
Fine. Do you wish to flyt against me?

Id: [0x002A9CBE]
Me?

Id: [0x002A9CBF]
Me?

Id: [0x002A9CC0]
Do we know each other?

Id: [0x002A9CC1]
Do we know each other?

Id: [0x002A9CC2]
Why do you speak to me this way?

Id: [0x002A9CC3]
Why do you speak to me this way?

Id: [0x002A9CC4]
I've consented to nothing yet.

Id: [0x002A9CC5]
I've consented to nothing yet.

Id: [0x002A9CC8]
Fair, fair. Return if you change your mind!

Id: [0x002A9CC9]
Happy returns after a sorry loss. Do you want to try again? Give me your best!

Id: [0x002A9CCA]
Good. Now place your bet.

Id: [0x002A9CCB]
Rome.

Id: [0x002A9CCD]
Ah, my old friend, Grim! How wonderful to see you here! What a pleasant surprise.

Id: [0x002A9CD1]
What surprise? I came as you requested.

Id: [0x002A9CD2]
Yes, and how is Grimsby? How are all the other Danes?

Id: [0x002A9CD3]
I can't speak for all Danes … but I am well. And itching for a hunt, as you made plain in your message this morning.

Id: [0x002A9CD4]
Yes, that's right, very good! Speaking of Danes I'd like to introduce you to Eivor.

Id: [0x002A9CDB]
A perfect mix!

Id: [0x002A9CDC]
No rune will protect you from my wrath if I catch you playing games.

Id: [0x002A9CDD]
No rune will protect you from my wrath if I catch you playing games.

Id: [0x002A9CDE]
Hail, Eivor. Did he lure you here as well, with the promise of a hunt?

Id: [0x002A9CDF]
Yes, hunting a bear! That's the point of all this, we're hunting. I promise.

Id: [0x002A9CE0]
There's a cave just up the hill there. Seems a likely place for a lair.

Id: [0x002A9CEA]
I'm game. Let's get a new fur cloak, shall we?

Id: [0x002A9D14]
Apart from this, the man's invisible. A coward if you ask me.

Id: [0x002A9FDF]
Come on, you can do better than that!

Id: [0x002A9FE0]
You're brilliant! Yes! More!

Id: [0x002A9FE1]
No no no. Wound me! Don't go easy on me! I can take it!

Id: [0x002A9FE6]
Come back again, if you ever feel ready.

Id: [0x002A9FE8]
Happy to be of service.

Id: [0x002A9FE9]
Happy to be of service.

Id: [0x002A9FEA]
You deserve every bit of your bet and more. I'll remember some of those insults!

Id: [0x002A9FED]
Eivor, you're skilled enough, and I can't tell you how to handle this, but … please, by God, help me with this!

Id: [0x002A9FEE]
Soon to be a sea of fire.

Id: [0x002A9FEF]
Soon to be a sea of fire.

Id: [0x002AA03C]
Thor's hammer, what was that?

Id: [0x002AA040]
Will none of you lift a finger to aid your master?

Id: [0x002AA045]
Enough of this cat and mouse. Where is your brother, the one they call The Seax?

Id: [0x002AA046]
Enough of this cat and mouse. Where is your brother, the one they call The Seax?

Id: [0x002AA047]
He means to kill Aelfred?

Id: [0x002AA048]
He means to kill Aelfred?

Id: [0x002AA049]
He is a ghost now. But he will make himself flesh once more at the witan. And Aelfred will be king no more!

Id: [0x002AA050]
So what am I looking for?

Id: [0x002AA051]
Will I know it when I see it?

Id: [0x002AA053]
What does he want?

Id: [0x002AA055]
Do not finish that thought.

Id: [0x002AA056]
You.

Id: [0x002AA057]
You.

Id: [0x002AA06B]
Avgos was a hero, and you let him die! A hero for all Lunden!

Id: [0x002AA06C]
They'll hand Lunden to the unwashed tides, mark these words!

Id: [0x002AA070]
They flatter me. I am only a guest in their world. A world spun of wishes and hopes.

Id: [0x002AA071]
Basim … you sent the message. You led us to Eivor's grave.

Id: [0x002AA07B]
Yes. A hopeful message, was it not?

Id: [0x002AA07D]
In our day, all the world was connected like this. A super-organism of technology.

Id: [0x002AA085]
May I show you something?

Id: [0x002AA08D]
Not as much as you might think. I am tethered to my body in a most uncomfortable way.

Id: [0x002AA096]
But you can slow this machine down. You know how it works.

Id: [0x002AA099]
Yes. We'll do it together, for another catastrophe is near at hand. This node of time has an ugly way of correcting itself.

Id: [0x002AA0AA]
The Good Sister was murdered, and where were your guards! You hear me Erke? Her blood's on you!

Id: [0x002AA0AB]
It's a ruse, I tell you! It's them that killed Tryggr and shifted the blame!

Id: [0x002AA0AD]
Is that why you've been off alone, hunting wolves and fretting about your future?

Id: [0x002AA0B4]
Let's finish them.

Id: [0x002AA0B5]
Kill these heathen bastards!

Id: [0x002AA0B7]
It feels like home already!

Id: [0x002AA0B9]
Like a blade through butter!

Id: [0x002AA0BC]
You had your chance to turn away! And it passed you by!

Id: [0x002AA0BE]
Who are these people!

Id: [0x002AA0BF]
Norse scum!

Id: [0x002AA0C7]
You have what you wished for, Dag!

Id: [0x002AA0C8]
You have what you wished for, Dag!

Id: [0x002AA0C9]
Ah! Y-you're not a bandit, are you?

Id: [0x002AA0CB]
O God, O God! What's going on out there?

Id: [0x002AA0CC]
W-wait, who are you? Are you with those brigands as well?

Id: [0x002AA0CF]
Are you friend or enemy?

Id: [0x002AA0D0]
Not a bandit, no. Who are you?

Id: [0x002AA0D1]
Not a bandit, no. Who are you?

Id: [0x002AA102]
I imagine you can do anything you want in this place.

Id: [0x002AA106]
Have a look around, all of you. I want no more surprises.

Id: [0x002AA10A]
How about I beat on his liver 'til he builds us a wall for free!

Id: [0x002AA10B]
You're a hard man to trust. You must know that.

Id: [0x002AA10C]
You're not obliged to trust me. But this is all I can offer.

Id: [0x002AA10D]
Don't be reckless, Little Voice.

Id: [0x002AA114]
Do not tarry! Your death by flyting awaits! Fergal will claim another sorry soul!

Id: [0x002AA126]
You do have power here. Power you have earned.

Id: [0x002AA127]
You grapple with forces outside your control.

Id: [0x002AA130]
The well is sealed. Someone labors to keep me out.

Id: [0x002AA131]
The well is sealed. Someone labors to keep me out.

Id: [0x002AA132]
I will take it as a challenge.

Id: [0x002AA133]
I will take it as a challenge.

Id: [0x002AA138]
Basim! Where are you?

Id: [0x002AA13C]
What is that?

Id: [0x002AA13F]
God dammit.

Id: [0x002AA141]
Silence Urdr, Verdandi, Skuld. Be at ease. Your day of rest has come.

Id: [0x002AA143]
Is that it? Is it done?

Id: [0x002AA146]
Your will is my deed, Rune-Writer.

Id: [0x002AA14A]
Stop. Wipe everything. Run it again.

Id: [0x002AA14B]
Nothing. No. Wipe it. Run again.

Id: [0x002AA14C]
Nothing. Wipe all data. Run it again.

Id: [0x002AA150]
Layla. Hello.

Id: [0x002AA151]
You know me?

Id: [0x002AA153]
Yes. Through the calculations I read, here in the Gray.

Id: [0x002AA155]
Eight years ago, the odds of your arrival were fifteen trillion, fifty-five million, three thousand, two hundred, and seventy-six to one.

Id: [0x002AA158]
As the years passed by, those odds improved. And as of yesterday, near even.

Id: [0x002AA15A]
It's a pleasure to meet you at last.

Id: [0x002AA15B]
Who are you? And what is this?

Id: [0x002AA15E]
I am the reader of the calculations. All these, possible futures for you and the world outside.

Id: [0x002AA160]
I have spent much of my new life reading these, searching for a way to finish everything we started so long ago.

Id: [0x002AA162]
It begins here. You slow down this machine and save the world, from which point all possible futures expand.

Id: [0x002AA164]
But in every one, another catastrophe recurs. The node collapses, and the world is wiped out. The human race dwindles, and fades.

Id: [0x002AA165]
I must keep looking. I must find the solution for you. I must leave you with something.

Id: [0x002AA16B]
This node? This is right now, where I slow down this machine?

Id: [0x002AA16D]
Yes. I start all my calculations from this point, the only thing I know for certain.

Id: [0x002AA16F]
What if you went back further, to 2012, when Desmond saved the world?

Id: [0x002AA171]
Desmond…

Id: [0x002AA173]
What if he didn't save the world? What if he walked away and let the world burn? Look at those timelines. Read them instead.

Id: [0x002AA177]
I see. An interesting idea.

Id: [0x002AA17A]
Fascinating.

Id: [0x002AA17C]
Exactly. These are timelines that never came to pass. But they could have.

Id: [0x002AA181]
That is brilliant. How did you come to that idea?

Id: [0x002AA184]
If you spend too much time narrowing down what is possible, you may never give another thought to the improbable.

Id: [0x002AA18C]
Thank you for your insights, Layla.

Id: [0x002AA18E]
Are you staying?

Id: [0x002AA190]
Until we find something useful, I will. I don't want this to happen ever again.

Id: [0x002AA192]
You may not have much time, Layla. The machine is powered down, but the radiation … it will linger for decades.

Id: [0x002AA1CD]
You there below, with your body so wee!<LF>Do you think that you'll ever be up here like me?

Id: [0x002AA1CE]
Ah! It's you again!

Id: [0x002AA1CF]
Welcome back! You've gotten smaller since I saw you last.

Id: [0x002AA1D7]
I call down from on high, the full strength of the gods.<LF>To defeat all the stammerers, weaklings, and frauds!

Id: [0x002AA1DC]
I am here in the clouds, while you crawl on the ground!<LF>Like a sad little worm, making a pitiful sound!

Id: [0x002AA1E1]
I have every advantage, I see for an age!<LF>My words are my weapons, these ramparts my stage!

Id: [0x002AA1E6]
Well, for a mere speck of a flyter, you're surprisingly strong.

Id: [0x002AA1E7]
I knew it. Talent as tiny as you, barely visible to my eye.

Id: [0x002AA1E8]
I accept and like lightning, will leave you dumbstruck.

Id: [0x002AA1E9]
I accept and like lightning, will leave you dumbstruck.

Id: [0x002AA1EA]
Not today. Enjoy the view.

What know you of the power of flyts to seduce?<LF>Are you even aware that they have such a use?

On your every word, I can say that I'm hung.

One more gift for you, Dane. A deadly truth, if you can find it.

Id: [0x002AA5CF]
Fergal the Faceless, the most fearsome flyter in all of Grantebridgescire.

Id: [0x002AA5D1]
Fergal the Faceless has silenced doubters before. Will you challenge him?

Id: [0x002AA5D3]
You are right to be afraid. You may return to me, should you ever wish to face death by flyting.

Id: [0x002AA5D5]
You are braver than most. Or perhaps more foolish. Come, I will give you a key.

Id: [0x002AA5D6]
This key unlocks Fergal's lair, which you see now before you!

Id: [0x002AA5D8]
Go! Go now. And God be with you.

It will be a rude awakening if she does not come around willingly! I will not use her gently.

Quit stalling and kiss her, dung-mead! Consummate your betrothal!

Id: [0x002AA642]
Yes, a kiss! A brief taste to whet my appetite!

Id: [0x002AA648]
They've breached the walls. I must find Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002AA649]
They've breached the walls. I must find Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002AA658]
Are you with me?

Id: [0x002AA65B]
It worked perfectly, my dear.

Id: [0x002AA65C]
Is the Mad One here?

Id: [0x002AA65D]
No, my love. Only we remain.

Id: [0x002AA661]
The Heir of Memories fulfilled her role perfectly.

Id: [0x002AA664]
Perhaps you should try again? Speak his story. In order.

Id: [0x002AA668]
For all the dead we collect, dear sister, you and I are equals.

Id: [0x002AA66C]
We are blood and bone and spirit, Frideswid. Perfect as we are.

Id: [0x002AA66D]
We are blood and bone and spirit, Frideswid. Perfect as we are.

Id: [0x002AA671]
He didn't deserve this.

Id: [0x002AA673]
He chose this.

Id: [0x002AA674]
He chose this.

Id: [0x002AA677]
I cannot do that.

Id: [0x002AA678]
Lay it by, Leofrith. There's nothing left to fight for. We've stormed Repton. Only a matter of time.

Id: [0x002AA679]
Lay it by, Leofrith. There's nothing left to fight for. We've stormed Repton. Only a matter of time.

Id: [0x002AA682]
Delicious! Your lips are two pillows on a bed of reinrose petals!

Id: [0x002AA683]
And yours are cold and rough as unpolished stone.

Id: [0x002AA684]
What trickery is this?

Id: [0x002AA686]
I've been told it has a seductive quality.

Id: [0x002AA687]
By a wolf.

Id: [0x002AA688]
Treachery! Bring me the real Freyja or my offer is withdrawn!

Id: [0x002AA689]
I'll bring myself, if you don't mind.

Id: [0x002AA68B]
Freyja, you don't need to--

Id: [0x002AA68C]
You have next to nothing, Aesir! Only this useless monument to your ineptitude.

Id: [0x002AA68D]
You've been a good boy, Thor. Don't gamble your winnings.

Id: [0x002AA690]
And you, Havi…

Id: [0x002AA691]
Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002AA692]
Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002AA693]
You tried to avoid responsibility by not making a choice, but that was a choice in itself. And look where it has brought us!

Id: [0x002AA694]
You spoke of sacrifice, but you risked nothing of your own. It was I who shouldered that burden!

Id: [0x002AA695]
You implied you had a plan. I hope with all my heart this wasn't it.

Id: [0x002AA6A3]
No one has done more for Asgard than me. Did I not carve this land from Ymir's steaming flesh and bones?

Id: [0x002AA6A4]

We have taken you for granted, it's true. That ends now.

Id: [0x002AA6A9]
We have taken you for granted, it's true. That ends now.

Id: [0x002AA6AB]
You are no one's prize just yet. If this scheme turns sour, I will fight for you 'til my sinews snap and my bones break.

Id: [0x002AA6AC]
You are no one's prize just yet. If this scheme turns sour, I will fight for you 'til my sinews snap and my bones break.

Id: [0x002AA6B8]
He speaks true. A man without an enemy defeats himself.

Id: [0x002AA6BA]
Justify all you want, you're just a king-killer and a coward.

Id: [0x002AA6BB]
Justify all you want, you're just a king-killer and a coward.

Id: [0x002AA6BE]
I need only one. You, Thor, Lord of Thunder. Together we'll cripple the enemy before they grow too bold.

Id: [0x002AA6C6]
Aim! And fire!

Id: [0x002AA6C7]
You must be Erke, Lunden's second reeve.

From one man, such hatred is easy to spot. But from many, it's a fog that fills the room.

I'm with you!

Id: [0x002AA6F4]
Regroup!

Id: [0x002AA6F5]
Regroup!

Take up your axe. Drive the Mercians out.

To Helheim with you!

Id: [0x002AA71A]
You break too easily!

Id: [0x002AA71F]
The Temple is yours to explore, Eivor. It's to the east of here. I must wear my Reeve's face for a time.

Id: [0x002AA726]
Stowe, I will catch you at the Western Market.

God be with us, friends. Go in His name, and be protected by Him.

Id: [0x002AA72E]
Death to all Jotnar!

Id: [0x002AA72F]
Our strength is unmatched!

Id: [0x002AA730]
Glory belongs to the fearless!

Id: [0x002AA732]
Gaaah! A good fight! But I wish there were more!

Id: [0x002AA735]
The sky itself shatters before your might, Thor!

The integrity of this sacred place must be preserved, but whether we be a bane or a boon remains to be seen.

Id: [0x002AA746]
I doubt the Nornir will appreciate our visit. The curious are not welcome here.

Id: [0x002AA749]
Careful! Careful!

Id: [0x002AA74A]
What does this Builder intend with the water?

Id: [0x002AA74C]
Lesser things sometimes have a greater impact.

Id: [0x002AA74F]
We'll have come and gone before they feel our presence.

Id: [0x002AA750]
We'll have come and gone before they feel our presence.

Loki?

Id: [0x002AA756]
Loki?

Id: [0x002AA75A]
I'll sharpen my axe with your teeth, beast!

Id: [0x002AA75B]
Wolf! Wolf…!

Id: [0x002AA75E]
The Havi leads the hunt!

Id: [0x002AA75F]
Kill the Aesir! Burn their halls!

Id: [0x002AA76D]
I hope so. Let's get the paint and go.

Id: [0x002AA76E]
We got lucky.

Id: [0x002AA770]
Is that all of them?

Id: [0x002AA771]
Is that all of them?

Id: [0x002AA772]
Let's take what we need and go! We have no time to tarry.

Our Havi returns.

Stay right there, Builder. We're not finished with you.

Wolves. I should slay every last one. No prophecy shall bind me.

Wolves. I should slay every last one. No prophecy shall bind me.

Witness the Wolf from the Well!

Id: [0x002AA7B5]
And their horns protect against poison.

Id: [0x002AA7BA]
I've heard of such beasts. They swim below the ice, beyond the world's edge.

You have won! My life is yours.

Id: [0x002AA88A]
Not their innocence.

Id: [0x002AA8BB]
An immeasurable gift. Why refuse it?

Rollo's men, caged like plump hens.

Rollo's men, caged like plump hens.

Please. You do not want to do this.

I answer to my king. I silence Danes … with this.

Id: [0x002AA941]
Leofrith! Let him walk. You answer to me.

Id: [0x002AA942]
Leofrith! Let him walk. You answer to me.

Someone will.

Then you will die.

Then you will die.

Their eyes are scooped out, black empty caverns. Same as Tryggr's guards.

It's the riverbank, vinr (friend). Every crooked dealing in this city goes through here.

Any hunches about The Leech you want to share?

A few days back, left after sundown. Never came home, my Regna. Gods, if I could see her again.

Id: [0x002AAB33]
Never told me his name nor where he hammers. Tight-lipped about everything, the stubborn girl.

Id: [0x002AAB4C]
What sort of job did she have?

Id: [0x002AAB4D]
What sort of job did she have?

Id: [0x002AAB5B]
Good. Find me at the ale-house when you're done. And try not to scare the piss from any of them.

Do you know the name of the man?

Eivor! Good to see you! Will you drink with us?

Id: [0x002AAB92]
Eivor! Eivor's returned! Have a drink with us, and we'll flyt again!

Id: [0x002AAB9A]
Your face is a wreck, you're a blight on the Norse.

Id: [0x002AAB9F]
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, yes! Have another drink.

Id: [0x002AABA4]
You're brilliant! You're the smartest person I've ever met.

Id: [0x002AABA9]
Aaaaaaaah!

Id: [0x002AABAA]
Awful! Terrible! I knew just by looking at you, you couldn't hold your mead.

Id: [0x002AABAB]
O, I'll shut your big mouth while I finish my brew.

Id: [0x002AABAC]
O, I will shut your big mouth while I finish my brew.

Not today. Enjoy your ale.

Pour. I'm thirsty.

Pour. I'm thirsty.

Not now.

Well, you're thick-skulled and loathsome and lacking a brain.

Will you flyt against me and try testing your luck?

Id: [0x002AABDB]
Very good! Will you challenge me?

Id: [0x002AABDC]
It is. I've returned.

Id: [0x002AABDD]
It is. I have returned.

Id: [0x002AABDF]
Well challenge me then.

Id: [0x002AABE0]
But my ability has only grown.

Id: [0x002AABE1]
But my ability has only grown.

Id: [0x002AABE3]
Not bad! But what will you wager?

Id: [0x002AABED]
And those men who approach, I make fools of them all…

Id: [0x002AABEF]
And my height goes to show how above you I stand…

Id: [0x002AABF1]
You miniscule little imp! You're a terrible flyter!

Id: [0x002AABF2]
What's that? All I hear from up here is nonsense!

Id: [0x002AABF5]
You've earned your winnings. You're a mighty little midge!

Id: [0x002AABF7]
Better luck next time.

Id: [0x002AABF8]
Better luck next time.

Id: [0x002AABF9]
Go now! Return when you've grown up!

Id: [0x002AABFB]
What's it like being tiny, an ant in the loam?

I am with The Order. The Leech bade me give you a message.

I'm with The Order. The Leech bade me give you a message.

Id: [0x002AAC40]
I'm starting to doubt this is the den of a bear specifically…

A bear would make its den in a closed, quiet place. A cave would be perfect.

Now, that's not a fair read on her work. She never kills without reason.

Id: [0x002AAC59]
Where she always is. The old forum in the shade of the Giant's Wall.

Id: [0x002AAC5B]
Breaking them on the bodies of the poor and unwell? We warned her against such evil.

That's for us to decide. Where is she now?

That's not my doing! Sister Frideswid is breaking them faster than I can smith!

Ah…!

Id: [0x002AAC65]
What happened to her?

Id: [0x002AAC66]
What happened to her?

Id: [0x002AAC69]
She would, and she has it. Comes to me for all her wants, and I craft for her what she needs.

Id: [0x002AAC77]
No!

Id: [0x002AAC91]
If you need me, I'll be at Saint Paul's, searching for something on The Compass.

Id: [0x002AAC92]
Thanks for all this, Broga.

Id: [0x002AAC9E]
Eivor! Of the Raven Clan? Come here, come closer.

Id: [0x002AACA1]
Do you like to drink?

Id: [0x002AACA3]
And do you like to flyt?

Id: [0x002AACA5]
Well, listen! Here, these folk aren't impressed by the speed of your thinking.

Id: [0x002AACA6]
They will only respect you for how much you're drinking.

Id: [0x002AACA7]
If you're sober, then leave! For there's naught here for you!

Id: [0x002AACA8]
Eivor. Of the Raven Clan.

I do.

Id: [0x002AACAF]
I do.

Id: [0x002AACB0]
We always do!

Id: [0x002AACB2]
That's the spirit! Now make your wager. The ale's free to those who flyt.

Id: [0x002AACB6]
Ha! I like this one! Are you ready? What about one more drink before we begin? For luck.

Id: [0x002AACB8]
Brilliant! Come, come, have a drink and make a wager.

Id: [0x002AACB9]
Leave and come back when you're ready to drink and do some proper flyting.

Id: [0x002AACBE]
You're a pig-headed, ugly, excuse for a Dane.

Id: [0x002AACC1]
I'm a champion, a winner, I'll claim the top prize!

Id: [0x002AACC2]
You hold your own.

Id: [0x002AACC3]
You hold your own.

Id: [0x002AACC4]
Let's have another!

Id: [0x002AACC7]
Yes! Yes, here's the next one.

Id: [0x002AACC8]
I'm a champion, a winner, I'll claim the top prize!

Id: [0x002AACC9]
Ha! I will say it again!

Id: [0x002AACCB]
Three cheers for Eivor, the most masterful wordsmith in all of England!

Id: [0x002AACCC]
I'd say the same of you, friend.

Id: [0x002AACCD]
I'd say the same of you, friend.

Id: [0x002AACCE]
That was the most incredible flyting I've heard in all my years! You are a wonder!

Coward! Face me!

Id: [0x002AACFD]
Not a bad place, Eivor. Not at all!

Id: [0x002AAD07]
Will you not be lending us a hand?

Id: [0x002AAD08]
Basim is with us for the long haul, have no doubt. But he does have something he must see to first.

Id: [0x002AAD09]
Our scouts should not be long in returning. They are swift and thorough.

Id: [0x002AAD10]
Hytham will require your trust and support. Know he works toward the greater good.

Id: [0x002AAD11]
We will hear him out and flush this order from wherever they hide. Anything to pacify this land to our purpose.

Id: [0x002AAD12]
Whatever secret errands he has for us, I ask that he clear them with me first.

Id: [0x002AAD13]
Is Gunnar at his forge yet? I hear no clatter from that quarter.

Id: [0x002AAD15]
Eivor, hello.

Id: [0x002AAD17]
Have you finished building Gunnar's forge?

Id: [0x002AAD19]
Eivor. We must speak when you have finished with Gunnar.

Id: [0x002AAD1A]
Not yet. But soon.

Id: [0x002AAD1B]
Not yet. But soon.

Id: [0x002AAD1E]
Not yet. I will.

Id: [0x002AAD1F]
Not yet. I will.

Id: [0x002AAD20]
Ah! This is wonderful, Eivor! A forge bigger and hotter than my old forge back in Fornberg.

Id: [0x002AAD23]
Come visit me anytime. For weapons and gear, there is no man better than me.

Id: [0x002AAD27]
I will, Gunnar. Have no doubt.

Id: [0x002AAD28]
I will, Gunnar. Have no doubt.

Eivor, in here.

My finest weapon. For this room is yours … here you may lay your head, hang your axe, or be alone with your thoughts.

Id: [0x002AAD31]
Do you like it?

Id: [0x002AAD34]
What will you keep in this room?

Id: [0x002AAD35]
What will you keep in this room?

Id: [0x002AAD58]
Morning, Eivor!

Id: [0x002AADF0]
Sorry for this, Eivor. I've had one last glory, I should be happy. I am happy. Thank you.

Id: [0x002AAE1F]
Skal!

Id: [0x002AAE20]
Skal!

Id: [0x002AAE21]
Skal!

Id: [0x002AAF2B]
When wrongdoers came to devour my flesh, these enemies stumbled and fell.

Id: [0x002AAF32]
You are a man of your word. A man of God.

Id: [0x002AAF33]
You are a man of your word. A man of God.

Id: [0x002AAF35]
Here is the only silver fit for one of your dragon-boats. A reminder of Christ's sacrifice and our charity.

Id: [0x002AAF36]
This too, I offer you. Live here among us in peace as a Christian, or die a pagan in a blood soaked field. All you have to lose is life everlasting.

Id: [0x002AAF38]
And if I choose neither?

Id: [0x002AAF39]
And if I choose neither?

Id: [0x002AAF3A]
He offers you hope, Eivor. A life of purpose above and beyond this one. You'd be a fool to refuse.

Id: [0x002AAF69]
Return to your Jotnar masters!

Id: [0x002AAF6A]
Return to your Jotnar masters!

Id: [0x002AAF6B]
You'll rue that strike!

Id: [0x002AAF6C]
You'll rue that strike!

Id: [0x002AAF6D]
Blood for Asgard!

Id: [0x002AAF6E]
Blood for Asgard!

Id: [0x002AAF71]
Say hello to Jormungandr!

Id: [0x002AAF72]
Say hello to Jormungandr!

Id: [0x002AAF84]
This is the mountain I seek. There is no higher peak.

Id: [0x002AAF85]
This is the mountain I seek. There is no higher peak.

Id: [0x002AAF87]
People talk.

Id: [0x002AAF88]
I've heard all the rumors that Eivor the Dane is a coward, a cur, and a leech.

Id: [0x002AAF8B]
Perhaps you can swing that wee axe on your belt, but I doubt you've much talent for speech.

Id: [0x002AAF8C]
How do you know me?

Id: [0x002AAF8D]
How do you know me?

Id: [0x002AAF8E]
Eivor the Quitter! I'll pass it on.

Id: [0x002AAF92]
Sounds like the rumors are true.

Id: [0x002AAF93]
We'll see. Make a wager.

Id: [0x002AAF99]
I'll need a wager first.

Id: [0x002AAF9B]
Ivarr! You lost on the beach at Mona, and you will lose here.

Id: [0x002AAF9C]
I'll broil you alive and feed your balls to chickens, Ynyr!

Id: [0x002AAF9D]
Your army is weak! We will gut you like tired swine!

Id: [0x002AAF9E]
I'll pull your tongue through the back of your throat just to shut you up.

Id: [0x002AAF9F]
So much for Ynyr. Fearsome Briton, my bunghole.

Id: [0x002AAFD3]
You would do better to shut your mouth. I'll be back.

Id: [0x002AAFD4]
You would do better to shut your mouth. I'll be back.

Id: [0x002AAFD5]
I'll be sure to spread word of your failure across England.

Id: [0x002AAFD6]
Recite the phrase "May The Father of Understanding Guide Us," and he'll know it's you.

Id: [0x002AAFD8]
Don't believe everything you hear. Unless it touches on my flyting. Then heed every word.

Id: [0x002AAFD9]
Don't believe everything you hear. Unless it touches on my flyting. Then heed every word.

Id: [0x002AAFDA]
Take the coin and know that only praise will henceforth cross my lips.

Id: [0x002AAFDB]
Eivor! Over here!

Id: [0x002AAFDD]
Where are you? Show yourself.

Id: [0x002AAFDE]
Where are you? Show yourself.

Id: [0x002AAFE1]
Look here! Look upon this masterpiece!

Id: [0x002AAFE5]
I draw smiles from the women and winks from the men.<LF>I'm a poetry-lover who's skilled with his pen.

Id: [0x002AAFE7]
If you fancy a round, then approach and come speak.<LF>If you're lustful for verse, then I've got what you seek.

Id: [0x002AAFE9]
How do you mean?

Id: [0x002AAFEA]
How do you mean?

Id: [0x002AAFEB]
Mm, yes. I cannot help but wonder: is your flyting as striking as you?

Id: [0x002AAFEC]
What? Right from the bull's arse this is!

Id: [0x002AAFED]
Pity. Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002AAFEE]
With a wager, I mean.

Id: [0x002AAFEF]
Perfect. Would you like to make it …interesting?

Id: [0x002AAFF0]
With pleasure. Place your bet, won't you?

Id: [0x002AAFF1]
Pity. I was so excited.

Id: [0x002AAFF7]
See, your weapon lies not in your belt, but your head.

Id: [0x002AAFF8]
Thank you. Are we ready?

Id: [0x002AAFFC]
I could feel when you entered, the room became warm.<LF>Though I doubted your flyting, I quite liked your form.

Id: [0x002AAFFE]
Hmm … Expected you to be a bit smoother. No matter. Let's keep at it.

Id: [0x002AB00B]
But instead of just telling, I'll happily show.

Id: [0x002AB00F]
Where are you leading me?

Id: [0x002AB010]
Where are you leading me?

Id: [0x002AB029]
So what do you say? Shall we find somewhere and exchange a little more than words?

Id: [0x002AB02B]
That was delicious. It's rare that I meet one who can keep pace with me.

Id: [0x002AB02D]
It's been a true pleasure.

Id: [0x002AB02E]
It was only a flyt. My winnings please.

Id: [0x002AB02F]
It was only a flyt. My winnings please.

Id: [0x002AB030]
Yes, of course. I was only … it was just a game, yes? Friendly … banter?

Id: [0x002AB033]
Absolutely.

Id: [0x002AB034]
Absolutely.

Id: [0x002AB035]
Good. If you enjoyed my flyting, you'll be thrilled by what else a skilled mouth can do.

Id: [0x002AB036]
But this sort of thing happens to everyone, from time to time. Take a rest and return when you're feeling better.

Id: [0x002AB052]
Are you ready to pit your weak wordplay against my strong … one?

Id: [0x002AB053]
Come crawling back, have you?

Id: [0x002AB05B]
Come and flyt me, All-Father, it's time to perform.<LF>I'm the ruler of thunder, you're caught in the storm.

Id: [0x002AB060]
I've slain giants and monsters, I'm endlessly brave.<LF>I'm adored by the masses from warrior to slave.

Id: [0x002AB065]
Shame serves as your shadow wherever you roam.<LF>Your failure's the point, and I'll hammer it home:

Id: [0x002AB06B]
Ha! I have bested the Prince of Poets!

Id: [0x002AB06C]
I'll accept your challenge and teach you a lesson through humiliation.

Id: [0x002AB06D]
I'll accept your challenge and teach you a lesson through humiliation.

Id: [0x002AB06E]
Your wit is not your best weapon. Put your trust in your hammer.

Id: [0x002AB06F]
Your wit is not your best weapon. Put your trust in your hammer.

Id: [0x002AB070]
I will flyt. And I will win. Let us begin!

Id: [0x002AB071]
I will flyt. And I will win. Let us begin!

Id: [0x002AB072]
Never.

Id: [0x002AB073]
Never.

Id: [0x002AB07A]
You're an arrogant fool, Thor, and I truly don't envy your plight.

Id: [0x002AB07B]
You're an arrogant fool, Thor, and I truly don't envy your plight.

Id: [0x002AB07C]
O beware what you ask for, I'll finish the fight.

Id: [0x002AB07D]
O beware what you ask for, I will finish the fight.

Id: [0x002AB07E]
If I come there, I'll beat you, you'd rather me here.

Id: [0x002AB07F]
If I come there, I'll beat you, you'd rather me here.

Id: [0x002AB080]
Uh…

Id: [0x002AB081]
Uh…

Id: [0x002AB082]
I'm as wise as an owl, you're a fool of a god.

Id: [0x002AB083]
I'm as wise as an owl, you're a fool of a god.

Id: [0x002AB084]
That you think yourself beloved is very odd.

Id: [0x002AB085]
That you think yourself beloved is very odd.

Id: [0x002AB086]
You're an angry young cretin, your envy is clear.

Id: [0x002AB087]
You're an angry young cretin, your envy is clear.

Id: [0x002AB088]
Er…

Id: [0x002AB089]
Er…

Id: [0x002AB08A]
If you think you'll outlast me, I've terrible news.

Id: [0x002AB08B]
If you think you'll outlast me, I've terrible news.

Id: [0x002AB08C]
Well, your victory's not what my visions portend.

Id: [0x002AB08D]
Well, your victory's not what my visions portend.

Id: [0x002AB08E]
And I promise that the same fate awaits you, my friend.

Id: [0x002AB08F]
And I promise that the same fate awaits you, my friend.

Id: [0x002AB090]
Uhh…

Id: [0x002AB091]
Uhh…

Id: [0x002AB092]
Describe defeat for me, Thor. I do not know the taste.

Id: [0x002AB093]
Describe defeat for me, Thor. I do not know the taste.

Id: [0x002AB09E]
You have earned your place at The Arrow's side today. He'll be eager to meet you.

Id: [0x002AB0A1]
How unfortunate. A stirring of wind stole your chance.

Id: [0x002AB0A4]
You've got quite an eagle-eye on you.

Id: [0x002AB0A8]
How was that?

Id: [0x002AB0A9]
How was that?

Id: [0x002AB0AA]
You sought me out, old friend. And here I am, standing before the throne from which I reigned not long ago.

Id: [0x002AB0AF]
The Arrow is making his speech at the Imperial Arch. On your way now!

Id: [0x002AB0B4]
Go lick your wounds elsewhere. Everyone's heading to the rally.

Id: [0x002AB0B5]
You stand before us to accept this witan's unanimous decision. That you are unfit to rule and are hereby deposed.

Id: [0x002AB0B8]
We demand the abdication of your kingdom and your crown to Thegn Ceolwulf.

Id: [0x002AB0BD]
Is that you, old friend? Ah, yes, I see it now. Forgive me. The robes of righteousness sit so loosely upon your shoulders.

Id: [0x002AB0BF]
A challenge. Will you face me in flyting?

Id: [0x002AB0C1]
A cheat! A cheat!

Id: [0x002AB0C5]
Then I'll be at Saint Paul's Church, waiting for the good word. Take care, Broga.

Id: [0x002AB0C6]
If the heavens mismark me as king, forgive its obscuring light! Amen! Now … where is my crown?

Id: [0x002AB0DA]
Cross the water and meet me, I'll show you my might.

Id: [0x002AB0DC]
You are the worst of the Aesir, a coddled old clod.

Id: [0x002AB0DE]
You're a simpering graybeard who'll soon meet his end.

Id: [0x002AB0E5]
This … setback will only drive me to get better, to get stronger, and I will return and crush you! With my wit!

Id: [0x002AB0EA]
Come back around when you want another tongue lashing!

Id: [0x002AB0EF]
Fenrir! A good word has come!

Id: [0x002AB0F0]
Leave me.

Id: [0x002AB0F1]
I wish you well, Great Wolf. But a fear still hangs over Asgard. The Aesir worry about your growing size and strength!

Id: [0x002AB0F4]
Do they now…?

Id: [0x002AB0F6]
And what have they to be afraid of, old friend?

Id: [0x002AB0F8]
Havi brings a collar fashioned by the dwarves. A beacon that we may track from a distance, to know where you roam. Wear this and you may live and thrive in Asgard without worry.

Id: [0x002AB0FA]
I smell something … sour.

Id: [0x002AB0FE]
Son of Loki, have I not treated you with kindness? We are bonded, you and I. And as I trust my king, so you may trust me.

Id: [0x002AB0FF]
Open your mouth. As a pledge of faith, you may take my hand if I am untrue.

Id: [0x002AB101]
Fair.

Id: [0x002AB103]
Be swift, Havi.

Id: [0x002AB106]
Lies!

Id: [0x002AB108]
Havi?

Id: [0x002AB10A]
It burns!

Id: [0x002AB10B]
Unbind him!

Id: [0x002AB10D]
Havi!

Id: [0x002AB113]
Here you die, Deceiver!

Id: [0x002AB115]
Wear the collar or return to Jotunheimr. There's no third way.

Id: [0x002AB116]
Wear the collar or return to Jotunheimr. There's no third way.

Id: [0x002AB117]
The Arrow was a boy?

Id: [0x002AB11B]
Avgos? That can't be right.

Id: [0x002AB11E]
No, you've no reason to lie. Yet Avgos, my old friend, had no cause to murder.

Id: [0x002AB11F]
He saw Lunden as a kiln of rage. To harden the softness of its younger men.

Id: [0x002AB120]
Perhaps I ignored in him what I hoped not to see. Ambition, greed, anger.

Id: [0x002AB121]
A man with a boy's brain. Called Avgos.

Id: [0x002AB122]
A man with a boy's brain. Called Avgos.

Id: [0x002AB123]
I could return with his head on a spear if you would like to see.

Id: [0x002AB124]
I could return with his head on a spear if you'd like to see.

Id: [0x002AB128]
Power. Men will claw for it and cling to it at the cost of everything.

Id: [0x002AB12E]
Very true. And it is cold comfort … when glory has the taste of your family's blood.

Id: [0x002AB12F]
Very true. And it's cold comfort … when glory has the taste of your family's blood.

Id: [0x002AB132]
Ceolbert! He's in trouble.

Id: [0x002AB133]
Ceolbert! He's in trouble.

Id: [0x002AB134]
Ow! Gods, what are you doing?

Id: [0x002AB136]
Yours is a piss-poor way of looking!

Id: [0x002AB13B]
I'm looking for Ceolbert. And you know where he is.

Id: [0x002AB13C]
I'm looking for Ceolbert. And you know where he is.

Id: [0x002AB13D]
Just tell me where he is. Unless you want more.

Id: [0x002AB13E]
Just tell me where he is. Unless you want more.

Id: [0x002AB141]
God's truth. I can't relax too much, otherwise I'll float away.

Id: [0x002AB147]
Without you, these walls might have crumbled beneath the grasping vines of The Order.

Id: [0x002AB14C]
And we … we'd be but poor fiefs of heathen scum!

Id: [0x002AB14D]
So, we tip our wrists and raise our voices in thanks.

Id: [0x002AB14F]
Go on, bob for it!

Id: [0x002AB151]
Leave me be.

Id: [0x002AB153]
Sigurd…?

Id: [0x002AB154]
Sigurd…?

Id: [0x002AB155]
If you wish it.

Id: [0x002AB156]
If you wish it.

Id: [0x002AB15F]
He refuses to leave his quarters. Right now, you are the only noble fit for this.

Id: [0x002AB16F]
Cruel and unfair? O, no. No, you have it backwards. I am the definition of what is fair and what is not.

Id: [0x002AB170]
I am your jarl, the source of all right and wrong. The lord of justice in this place.

Id: [0x002AB173]
[laugh]Have you never in your life known when to hold your tongue, Eivor? Nor defer to those wiser than yourself?

Id: [0x002AB179]
See to it that judgment is carried out exactly as I have said.

Id: [0x002AB17F]
Randvi, what is this?

Id: [0x002AB180]
Randvi, what is this?

Id: [0x002AB183]
Sigurd, the punishment must fit the crime. Your judgment is cruel and unfair.

Id: [0x002AB184]
Sigurd, the punishment must fit the crime. Your judgment is cruel and unfair.

Id: [0x002AB185]
As my brother and my jarl, I back you, Sigurd. But in the face of injustice, I cannot help but speak.

Id: [0x002AB186]
As my brother and my jarl, I back you, Sigurd. But in the face of injustice, I cannot help but speak.

Id: [0x002AB189]
Sigurd is our jarl. His word is law, whether or not you agree.

Id: [0x002AB18A]
Sigurd is our jarl. His word is law, whether or not you agree.

Id: [0x002AB196]
It was rubbish! You had discarded it!

Id: [0x002AB197]
It was not rubbish! I intended to use it!

Id: [0x002AB198]
Please. calm down.

Id: [0x002AB19A]
Where is Sigurd? I have no doubt he will take my side.

Id: [0x002AB19B]
If you think Sigurd will take the side of a thief, you are a brazen fool!

Id: [0x002AB19C]
I found the evidence! He hasn't a leg to stand on!

Id: [0x002AB19D]
That is not evidence! That is art!

Id: [0x002AB1A0]
You were never going to use that sailcloth! Admit it!

Id: [0x002AB1A2]
How could you know that?

Id: [0x002AB1A4]
They're pouring in from Heimdall's tower! We must clear the bridge!

Id: [0x002AB1A9]
They cloud our senses with enchantments!

Id: [0x002AB1AC]
War Bringer! The battle is not yet won!

Id: [0x002AB1B6]
Kill them, and their illusions die!

Id: [0x002AB1B7]
Kill them, and their illusions die!

Id: [0x002AB1BA]
If they've breached the gate to Jotunheim, someone must close it!

Id: [0x002AB1BE]
Jotunheim magic! It conjures a concealing mist!

Id: [0x002AB1C3]
Havi! This is not the time for an excursion!

Id: [0x002AB1CB]
My steel will shred their illusions.

Id: [0x002AB1CC]
My steel will shred their illusions.

Id: [0x002AB24F]
All this prattle solves nothing! Battle or death!

Id: [0x002AB250]
Well said, Raven-Feeder! Name those who may fight beside you!

Id: [0x002AB254]
What troubles you, Havi?

Id: [0x002AB255]
Does your far-sight tell you something?

Id: [0x002AB261]
More invaders! They gather at the Bifrost bridge!

Id: [0x002AB264]
Where is Loki? He should be guarding that door!

Id: [0x002AB265]
Were any creatures among the Jotnar? Draugr? Trolls … or wolves?

Id: [0x002AB26D]
Warn the others. The fight begins.

Id: [0x002AB26E]
Warn the others. The fight begins.

Id: [0x002AB27A]
Are you … are you Valka's mother? Svala?

Id: [0x002AB27B]
Are you … are you Valka's mother? Svala?

Id: [0x002AB281]
You need not fear the cold, Eivor. Where we are going the winds and snows cannot touch!

Id: [0x002AB28A]
Sigurd, can we not wait for this to pass?

Id: [0x002AB28B]
Sigurd, can we not wait for this to pass?

Id: [0x002AB28C]
To where? More glaciers and deserts of snow?

Id: [0x002AB28D]
To where? More glaciers and deserts of snow?

Id: [0x002AB326]
As you command.

Id: [0x002AB33B]
I want to thank you for your judgment, Eivor. For stepping in when Sigurd would not. In spite of what happened.

Id: [0x002AB33D]
Rarely. There have been moments when he was distressed, worried, afraid. But nothing like this. Never, ever, like this.

Id: [0x002AB33F]
If it isn't too late.

Id: [0x002AB340]
Poor man. I have never known him to be so angry and reckless. Is that a side you have seen?

Id: [0x002AB341]
Poor man. I have never known him to be so angry and reckless. Is that a side you have seen?

Id: [0x002AB342]
Let us do our best for him, as we take care of our own. We are his best hope for healing.

Id: [0x002AB343]
Let us do our best for him, as we take care of our own. We are his best hope for healing.

Id: [0x002AB40B]
That may be, but I'll assume the risk. If there's a price to be paid, I'll pay it.

Id: [0x002AB40D]
She's teaching Thor about organizing armies. A battle they're both losing.

Id: [0x002AB40F]
Tyr, you roll bones in a game you do not understand.

Id: [0x002AB410]
Tyr, you roll bones in a game you do not understand.

Id: [0x002AB411]
The Builder, yes… Is Freyja nearby?

Id: [0x002AB412]
The Builder, yes… Is Freyja nearby?

Id: [0x002AB413]
Come along then. You must all hear what I have to say.

Id: [0x002AB414]
Come along then. You must all hear what I have to say.

Id: [0x002AB450]
Stay down, muck-worm. I have some friends who'd like to speak with you.

Id: [0x002AB451]
Stay down, muck-worm. I have some friends who'd like to speak with you.

Id: [0x002AB561]
He may take some convincing, for we did not part on the best of terms.

Id: [0x002AB589]
Of course. That hedge-pig has brought down laws like a hammer on Wincestre. Executing sinners on spurious charges in the square.

Id: [0x002AB597]
To protect your people, you must sheathe your hand in an iron glove.

Id: [0x002AB598]
You grind your heels into the backs of freedmen, not those who deserve it.

Id: [0x002AB59A]
You are only a man, reeve. One dead branch on a fast dying tree.

Id: [0x002AB59B]
You are only a man, reeve. One dead branch on a fast dying tree.

Id: [0x002AB5A9]
…but I will do so on my terms. My demands are simple. Firstly, you must--

Id: [0x002AB5B0]
To glory!

Id: [0x002AB5B6]
For we earn no scars here. Only battle wisdom.

Id: [0x002AB5B9]
You fool, look around you. You have no leverage here. Plead for your life, for it's the only thing these men will grant you.

Id: [0x002AB5C2]
There you are. The drengr we must thank for our good fortune.

Id: [0x002AB5C6]
You are a leader of Einherjar!

Id: [0x002AB5D4]
In the meantime, we press on.

Id: [0x002AB5D6]
Is that … that's smoke! My God! My estate is burning like a twig!

Id: [0x002AB862]
What were you and the Builder discussing?

Id: [0x002AB863]
What were you and the Builder discussing?

Id: [0x002AB864]
Havi, my gentle jailer. You know we dwarves give nothing away for free.

Id: [0x002AB865]
The humans are a hearty people indeed, much stronger than we give them credit for.

Id: [0x002AB866]
Interesting indeed. I have often wondered at its source.

Id: [0x002AB867]
Curious. Thank you, Havi.

Id: [0x002AB888]
Do your people believe they will survive the final battle?

Id: [0x002AB889]
Do your people believe they will survive the final battle?

Id: [0x002AB88A]
As for your answer, many dwarves will die in the final battle. Ground into earth and reclaimed by the mountains.

Id: [0x002AB88D]
You talk of blood and bone, but I speak of your hugr. Can your spirit survive when life leaves the body?

Id: [0x002AB88E]
You talk of blood and bone, but I speak of your hugr. Can your spirit survive when life leaves the body?

Id: [0x002AB890]
Have you ever heard of hugr magic?

Id: [0x002AB891]
Have you ever heard of hugr magic?

Id: [0x002AB89C]
Now if that's all you came to know, you can piss off and let me work.

Id: [0x002AB8AC]
But today, the shire languishes. It needs the guidance of new blood.

Id: [0x002AB8AE]
I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002AB8B0]
[laugh]Ah! There it is, that dark sense of humor. Blunt as a hammer, eh? Like the one carried by your … your thunder god, the, ah … I don't recall the name.

Id: [0x002AB8B1]
What I mean to say is, I enjoy the company of your people. Or people like you. What little I've seen of them.

Id: [0x002AB8B2]
And I don't care what stuffy fools like Herefrith and Hunwald say. You Danes are damned decent people! Not dense at all.

Id: [0x002AB8B4]
I remember when the Danes first arrived, not long ago. The locals were terrified. Not of being raided, but of their spouses being seduced away!

Id: [0x002AB8B5]
With all your perfumes and braiding and grooming and … bathing, even! How novel!

Id: [0x002AB8B7]
It's true! We are learning as we go.

Id: [0x002AB8B8]
Between washing and braiding grooming, where do you people find the time to raid and ravage!

Id: [0x002AB8BB]
Hunting, definitely. The bear's lair should be nearby.

Id: [0x002AB8BC]
Like me.

Id: [0x002AB8BD]
Like me.

Id: [0x002AB8BE]
I'm the definition of new blood. It may be I should put my name in for ealdorman.

Id: [0x002AB8BF]
I'm the definition of new blood. It may be I should put my name in for ealdorman.

Id: [0x002AB8C0]
Kind of you to notice.

Id: [0x002AB8C1]
Kind of you to notice.

Id: [0x002AB8C2]
I hear you Saxons bathe once a year, whether you need it or not.

Id: [0x002AB8C3]
I hear you Saxons bathe once a year, whether you need it or not.

Id: [0x002AB8C4]
We sleep less than Saxons.

Id: [0x002AB8C5]
We sleep less than Saxons.

Id: [0x002AB8C6]
Are we hunting Aelfgar? Or is it your hope that I'll braid your hair?

Id: [0x002AB8C7]
Are we hunting Aelfgar? Or is it your hope that I'll braid your hair?

Id: [0x002AB8E6]
My judgment stands. Thirty times the sailcloth's value. That is final.

Id: [0x002AB9DF]
Good, good. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002AB9E0]
I have the plant you asked for. It took some effort.

Id: [0x002AB9E1]
I have the plant you asked for. It took some effort.

Id: [0x002ABA04]
Jotunheim scum! Welcome to your doom!

Id: [0x002ABA05]
Einherjar! Bring the Havi your blades! We'll drown our enemies in blood!

Id: [0x002ABA0A]
Ach, wolves! Ravenous troll-steeds.

Id: [0x002ABA0B]
Aelfgar? Eivor? There's something you'll want to see here.

Id: [0x002ABA0C]
That's not a bear…

Id: [0x002ABA0D]
That's not a bear…

Id: [0x002ABA0E]
Wolves!

Id: [0x002ABA0F]
Wolves!

Id: [0x002ABA14]
If we cannot find our lurking bear, we can certainly dispatch these wolves.

Id: [0x002ABA2E]
Back to my forge?

Id: [0x002ABA30]
At least we trade in goods, not people, Slave Master. I'll be glad to be back underground, away from these angry skies.

Id: [0x002ABA31]
Yes. Until your debt to me is paid in full. It was the dwarves who made the world a trading post.

Id: [0x002ABA32]
Yes. Until your debt to me is paid in full. It was the dwarves who made the world a trading post.

Id: [0x002ABA36]
Thank you, Ivaldi. You may go.

Id: [0x002ABA37]
Thank you, Ivaldi. You may go.

Id: [0x002ABA38]
You mean from Asgard, do you not? My debt to you is paid in full?

Id: [0x002ABA3A]
Thank you, Havi. I … I did not expect you to remember.

Id: [0x002ABA3C]
Under the mountains of Svartalfheim. Our mountains. To free the earth's riches, for this is what I know best.

Id: [0x002ABA3D]
Yes, as promised.

Id: [0x002ABA3E]
Yes, as promised.

Id: [0x002ABA3F]
Where will you go next?

Id: [0x002ABA40]
Where will you go next?

Id: [0x002ABAC7]
Loki, halt.

Id: [0x002ABAC8]
Loki, halt.

Id: [0x002ABAC9]
I will go to the well. You must find this Builder a clearing for his display.

Id: [0x002ABACA]
I will go to the well. You must find this Builder a clearing for his display.

Id: [0x002ABACB]
Go with the Builder, then return to the Great Hall with news of our next step.

Id: [0x002ABACC]
Go with the Builder, then return to the Great Hall with news of our next step.

Id: [0x002ABACF]
No no, it's no trouble, Havi. The damp and the dark appeal to me.

Id: [0x002ABAD0]
From the start, it was a kind creature. But our mistrust and cruelty have robbed the poor wolf of its sweetness and life.

Id: [0x002ABAD2]
We are past the time for such mercy. This wolf has power now that would test our strengths combined.

Id: [0x002ABAD8]
Would it be a kindness to kill it then?

Id: [0x002ABAD9]
Would it be a kindness to kill it then?

Id: [0x002ABADA]
Then we will offer him a different fate. This cord is unbreakable. You must convince him to wear it.

Id: [0x002ABADB]
Then we will offer him a different fate. This cord is unbreakable. You must convince him to wear it.

Id: [0x002ABADC]
It will act as a leash whose magic will signal that he is safely secured. An assurance to the Aesir who fear him.

Id: [0x002ABADD]
It will act as a leash whose magic will signal that he is safely secured. An assurance to the Aesir who fear him.

Id: [0x002ABB15]
I'll gather my things.

Id: [0x002ABB5B]
Fast on your feet! The Saxons are coming! Defend the dock.

Id: [0x002ABB5D]
Aye! Come on, men! Set oil jars on every road. We'll burn off any man who dares come close!

Id: [0x002ABB5E]
Those oil jars could be useful. Slow them down.

Id: [0x002ABB5F]
Those oil jars could be useful. Slow them down.

Id: [0x002ABB85]
Here come the bastards! Protect Estrid, prepare the ship!

Id: [0x002ABBCB]
Your journey has borne fruit.

Id: [0x002ABBCD]
We are fortunate that luck follows you like a dark feline. Against all odds, your success is what redeems you. Endears you.

Id: [0x002ABBD0]
Just enough to keep me awake.

Id: [0x002ABBD3]
Good.

Id: [0x002ABBDA]
Of the sweetest kind. Life. Which I intend to share, of course.

Id: [0x002ABBDB]
Of the sweetest kind. Life. Which I intend to share, of course.

Id: [0x002ABBDC]
And how charming do you find me now?

Id: [0x002ABBDD]
And how charming do you find me now?

Id: [0x002ABBDE]
I've barely seen Frigg since we--

Id: [0x002ABBDF]
I've barely seen Frigg since we--

Id: [0x002ABBE9]
Easier than expected. And how does the world look through a single eye?

Id: [0x002ABBEB]
What's done was bound to be. I bear no ill will to any here, not you, not Fenrir, not even Loki.

Id: [0x002ABBED]
Will you punish him?

Id: [0x002ABBF0]
You fight well with your off hand, as if born to it.

Id: [0x002ABBF1]
You fight well with your off hand, as if born to it.

Id: [0x002ABBF2]
It keeps me alert, focused.

Id: [0x002ABBF3]
It keeps me alert, focused.

Id: [0x002ABBF4]
I am not ready to forgive the trickster.

Id: [0x002ABBF5]
I am not ready to forgive the trickster.

Id: [0x002ABBF7]
All-Father! Giant Slayer! Doom bringer! Do you remember your fight with the Builder? The Jotun who disguised himself as a craftsman? It wasn't long ago.

Id: [0x002ABBF9]
I must admit, it was a glorious kill! I should have told you then, but my envy consumed me.

Id: [0x002ABBFB]
We should go hunting soon! Remember the days we used to hunt? With our wolves, Geri and Freki?

Id: [0x002ABBFE]
Let old times be new times!

Id: [0x002ABBFF]
I'll be seeing you, old one. Sleep with one eye open!

Id: [0x002ABC02]
I remember.

Id: [0x002ABC03]
I remember.

Id: [0x002ABC04]
It was a good fight.

Id: [0x002ABC05]
It was a good fight.

Id: [0x002ABC23]
Anyone lesser would have succumbed to his hatred.

Id: [0x002ABC25]
There was no other way, Havi. Our fates are fixed.

Id: [0x002ABC27]
It was not for you.

Id: [0x002ABC29]
Do not think your kindness has made you a new friend, Lord of Imbeciles. I will kill you. All of you, gorging on Aesir flesh.

Id: [0x002ABC32]
I could not strike the killing blow. All my oaths remain unbroken.

Id: [0x002ABC33]
I could not strike the killing blow. All my oaths remain unbroken.

Id: [0x002ABC34]
If I could have done this any other way--

Id: [0x002ABC35]
If I could have done this any other way--

Id: [0x002ABC36]
Fate or no, you've made a great sacrifice on my behalf.

Id: [0x002ABC37]
Fate or no, you've made a great sacrifice on my behalf.

Id: [0x002ABC3C]
You may strike the final blow, Son of Loki. But I will savor my years of freedom before we meet again.

Id: [0x002ABC3D]
You may strike the final blow, Son of Loki. But I will savor my years of freedom before we meet again.

Id: [0x002ABC3E]
Come, old friend. The healing hands of Freyja can help you.

Id: [0x002ABC3F]
Come, old friend. The healing hands of Freyja can help you.

Id: [0x002ABC45]
Here you stay, Fen-Dweller.

Id: [0x002ABC46]
Here you stay, Fen-Dweller.

Id: [0x002ABC48]
What's that?

Id: [0x002ABC49]
What's that?

Id: [0x002ABC4D]
Loki was charged with guarding this gate, and yet it was left open.

Id: [0x002ABC4E]
Loki was charged with guarding this gate, and yet it was left open.

Id: [0x002ABC50]
He told me of the Builder's request, an offer that gives me great worry.

Id: [0x002ABC53]
Why was this passage blocked? Has someone been here recently?

Id: [0x002ABC54]
Why was this passage blocked? Has someone been here recently?

Id: [0x002ABC55]
Do you hear me, Havi? This Builder is a stranger to us. We know not what he intends.

Id: [0x002ABC57]
Calm, old friend. What's needling you?

Id: [0x002ABC58]
I'm the King of Asgard, Tyr. Do not question my desire to protect her.

Id: [0x002ABC59]
I'm the King of Asgard, Tyr. Do not question my desire to protect her.

Id: [0x002ABC5B]
Well, your candor is … appreciated.

Id: [0x002ABC7E]
It is done. And all that stands between me and my home now is a foaming ribbon of surf and silt.

Id: [0x002ABC85]
Loki's hissing son churns the waters between our coasts. We'll need time to rest as we wait for fairer weather.

Id: [0x002ABC91]
Wolves everywhere, and not a bear in sight!

Id: [0x002ABC95]
Now's not the time for such worries, Eivor! Tonight we celebrate! Let's get you some mead!

Id: [0x002ABC99]
What do you want?

Id: [0x002ABC9A]
What do you want?

Id: [0x002ABC9B]
You! Dane! Come closer…

Id: [0x002ABC9D]
Oooh…

Id: [0x002ABC9E]
Ughhh…

Id: [0x002ABCA0]
(gasp)

Id: [0x002ABCA1]
My God…

Id: [0x002ABCA3]
Is that the same wolf as before? How did it grow so fast?

Id: [0x002ABCA4]
Is that the same wolf as before? How did it grow so fast?

Id: [0x002ABCAF]
I … I need to think. Give me time!

Id: [0x002ABCB0]
No! You get ready! The killing blow is … it's coming! It's…

Id: [0x002ABCB2]
Blood and death! Blood and death!

Id: [0x002ABCB3]
You remember Mildritha from the bakery?

Id: [0x002ABCB4]
Ah, you'll be happy to hear Reeve Selwyn arrested her.

Id: [0x002ABCB5]
O, I wouldn't doubt it. Probably stole the gaze of someone more important than your Egbert.

Id: [0x002AC430]
I can shoot a mid-flight seagull through the eye.

Id: [0x002AC431]
I can shoot a mid-flight seagull through the eye.

Id: [0x002AC447]
Loki's wind cast my arrows aside.

Id: [0x002AC448]
Loki's wind cast my arrows aside.

Id: [0x002AC449]
And you're still only good enough to beat me once.

Id: [0x002AC44B]
You're a poor shot, that's the end of it.

Id: [0x002AC454]
What is this?

Id: [0x002AC455]
The past we spun…

Id: [0x002AC456]
The present's done…

Id: [0x002AC457]
…the future comes on faster.

Id: [0x002AC458]
Are you doing this? Are you pushing this machine to its limit?

Id: [0x002AC459]
We'll never end…

Id: [0x002AC45A]
So here we wend…

Id: [0x002AC45B]
…in fealty to our master.

Id: [0x002AC45F]
Warriors, with me! The rest of you, guard the Great Hall!

Id: [0x002AC460]
Warriors, with me! The rest of you, guard the Great Hall!

Id: [0x002AC4AA]
I call it The Shithole. To the Mercians, it is Repton.

Id: [0x002AC4AB]
What do you call this place?

Id: [0x002AC4AC]
What do you call this place?

Id: [0x002AC4C0]
Havi! Loki said you'd be here.

Id: [0x002AC53D]
I love them whipped, weeping, and reeking of piss.

Id: [0x002AC54C]
A toast…

Id: [0x002AC54D]
A toast…

Id: [0x002AC555]
An outsider whose people ravaged his shire? I think he would have hated me.

Id: [0x002AC556]
An outsider whose people ravaged his shire? I think he would have hated me.

Id: [0x002AC558]
He had a large heart and a love for his people. I think I would have liked him too.

Id: [0x002AC559]
He had a large heart and a love for his people. I think I would have liked him too.

Id: [0x002AC57F]
Is the Jotun dead?

Id: [0x002AC584]
Me?

Id: [0x002AC585]
Me?

Id: [0x002AC586]
Eivor, back again! I've heard you're scared of flyting. Is that true?

Id: [0x002AC58C]
Well! If it isn't Eivor of the Raven Clan!

Id: [0x002AC593]
Burning to ash what you cannot possess. That is a child's way out.

Id: [0x002AC594]
Burning to ash what you cannot possess. That's a child's way out.

Id: [0x002AC596]
Forget what?

Id: [0x002AC597]
Forget what?

Id: [0x002AC5B3]
You're looking for skilled archers. And now you have found one.

Id: [0x002AC5B4]
You're looking for skilled archers. And now you've found one.

Id: [0x002AC5B6]
No! No, it is a den of nightmares! A pit of death from which few have ever escaped unharmed!

Id: [0x002AC5B7]
That's a house.

Id: [0x002AC5B8]
That is a house.

Id: [0x002AC5BA]
I see you've still got your targets set up.

Id: [0x002AC5BB]
I see you've still got your targets set up.

Id: [0x002AC5BD]
You mean this coin?

Id: [0x002AC5BE]
You mean this coin?

Id: [0x002AC5C0]
I do not. Is that a problem?

Id: [0x002AC5C1]
I don't. Is that a problem?

Id: [0x002AC5C3]
Not in this life. But he will not join us in immortality. The world we wake into will be free of his malice.

Id: [0x002AC5C6]
The Arrow awaits his new champion at the Imperial Arch. Don't delay.

Id: [0x002AC5C9]
After two attempts, Saer remains the winner.

Id: [0x002AC5E3]
Farewell, Son.

Id: [0x002AC5E4]
Farewell, Son.

Id: [0x002AC5E9]
I won't give up. I never do.

Id: [0x002AC5EA]
I will not give up. I never do.

Id: [0x002AC5F6]
Reeve's my title, sorry. Stowe's my name. Stowe of Lunden.

Id: [0x002AC6A1]
I fear he is possessed of a power that renders him … ever-living.

Id: [0x002AC6DE]
I told you I would see you crowned.

Id: [0x002AC6DF]
I told you I would see you crowned.

Id: [0x002AC746]
Good people of Wincestre. Open your eyes. See how Aelfred's lofty ideals are weighed down in this mire of human effluence.

Id: [0x002AC747]
These prisoners before you do not live by Aelfred's laws. They live above them. They wallow in shit, only guided by their own perversity.

Id: [0x002AC748]
Hubert here, his wits addled by ale, spoke false of Bishop Ealhferth, our pious servant of Wincestre, who even now lies cold in his grave-shroud.

Id: [0x002AC74A]
Your wife is a baying shrew, Hubert! Is there a man here who has not supped rancid mead from her cup?

Id: [0x002AC74E]
Ealhferth was no man of God! He'll burn for his sins!

Id: [0x002AC751]
When will your work be done, Selwyn? When all of Wincestre falls to your justice?

Id: [0x002AC754]
Wincestre has passed judgment, Hubert. May God have mercy on your cankerous soul.

Id: [0x002AC791]
Keep away! Keep away! The fight is over! Town hall will follow soon!

Id: [0x002AC797]
O, what a thrill! My heart is racing!

Id: [0x002AC799]
I wanted to give a good performance. My father always said I was quite the actor.

Id: [0x002AC79A]
Be glad it still beats at all. Your screaming drew half the guards in Colcestre down upon us.

Id: [0x002AC79B]
Be glad it still beats at all. Your screaming drew half the guards in Colcestre down upon us.

Id: [0x002AC7A8]
Invitation? Bah. I'm not much of a shot anyway. Good on them that makes it.

Id: [0x002AC7AA]
Fulke is a member of The Order as well? Hm. The wolves biting at my skirts grow craftier by the day.

Id: [0x002AC7AE]
Fulke was an enemy of Wessex. But it seems someone has already removed her threat from my lands.

Id: [0x002AC7B3]
If you didn't hear it was me, you have now.

Id: [0x002AC7B4]

We'll find The Arrow and The Leech. Killing both should drag The Compass back into port.

Rhodri will want us to get down on our knees and sniff the rosy wind blowing from his ass. I know the man.

Id: [0x002AC8B1]
Eivor, don't make me laugh. We both know what my word is worth. But sure, I will let you do the talking. Probably.

Id: [0x002AC8B2]
Excellent. Now … to the church, I think. Our guests await.

Brilliant! Some flyting spirit. How about a wager?

Shame. Come back when you're ready for a challenge.

Thank you.

Ah! Quick to bite back! Be careful, Jungulf!

Brilliant!

No sense of timing…

Clumsy phrasing.

Id: [0x002AC8C7]
Got you there, Jungulf! Ha!

Id: [0x002AC8C8]
Your clumsy flyting is the real bore here.

Id: [0x002AC8CA]
Come find me when you've honed your skills.

Id: [0x002AC8CC]
Take the gold. You've earned it.

Id: [0x002AC8CE]
Good. And how much will you wager?

You were not worth the effort.

The Daughters of Aegir bless our passage.

Id: [0x002AC908]
Those Saxons caught us without weapons. It's no way to die. That's true Christian behavior. Slaughtered us in our sleep.

Id: [0x002AC915]
Who is asking?

Id: [0x002AC919]
No, no, we had it for a time. Was nothing but a cluster of wattle-and-daub huts when we came. We made it lively.

Id: [0x002AC91A]
But the Saxons took it back. They appeared within the city, as if rising from the shadows, and drove us out.

Id: [0x002AC91C]
Grantebridge was a thriving hub of trade and song under the care of Soma, our jarlskona.

She's Regna, named for my grandmother, born with the same eyes. One green, one blue.

A beautiful name.

Push me any further Holger and I will make you eat that wretched hat of yours!

Id: [0x002ACBE9]
Do you not know fine millinery when you see it, Rowan? I could trade that hat for two of your horses.

Id: [0x002ACBEA]
Silence, both of you!

Id: [0x002ACBEB]
Randvi, I demand that this matter be settled here and now.

Id: [0x002ACBEC]
Have patience, Rowan. There is a time and place for such disputes.

Id: [0x002ACBED]
When does Eivor return? When can we settle this?

Id: [0x002ACBEE]
You will know as soon as I do. Now please, go home.

Id: [0x002ACBEF]
I can wait. It's no bother.

Id: [0x002ACBF0]
Holger, surely you can apologize to Rowan. It cannot be so difficult.

Id: [0x002ACBF1]
Apologize for what? Putting that horse to better use than Rowan has ever done? All she does is stand in the shade collecting flies.

Id: [0x002ACBF2]
You imbecile! She is collecting flies because she has no tail to shoo them away!

Id: [0x002ACBF3]
Rowan, please. This is pointless and absurd. If you were able to see what I've done with the perfect--

Id: [0x002ACBF4]
Randvi, I beg you. Silence this fool.

Id: [0x002ACBF5]
Please, just wait. Until Eivor comes, we cannot settle this.

Id: [0x002ACC04]
Rowan, Holger. Why all this shouting?

Even the mighty fall. And God's servant, the Bishop Ealhferth, was mighty indeed in defense of his God.

Eivor, thank Tyr.

Id: [0x002ACDAC]
Holger robbed me! And I demand he be punished!

Id: [0x002ACDAD]
Ah! Robbed is a pointed word. Does the deer rob the stream when she takes a drink? Does a cow rob a field as it crops on sweet grass?

Id: [0x002ACDB0]
Eivor, this matter requires sensitive judgment. Will you…?

Id: [0x002ACDB3]
I will start. I have been falsely accused by this Saxon philistine!

Id: [0x002ACDB4]
A filly what? Are you mocking me?

Id: [0x002ACDB9]
Eivor, you have known me as a skald for years. You have seen how my poems bring life and joy and wisdom to our people.

Id: [0x002ACDBB]
And you know that my work requires a certain, let us say, freedom … to make use of rare resources to compose my verses.

Id: [0x002ACDBC]
Often, when lacking the proper tools, I have made use of novel items. Alvis's walking stick. Tove's inks. All were given gladly.

Id: [0x002ACDBD]
You cut off my horse's tail to make a brush, you bleedin'--

Id: [0x002ACDBF]
As I was saying, this morning, in the throes of a poetic reverie, I realized that my latest piece required delicate brushwork.

Id: [0x002ACDC0]
I could have used a frayed stick, some cloth, my hands, but no … I needed something gentler, softer.

Id: [0x002ACDC1]
To make a perfect brush, I needed the fine hairs of a well-raised horse. And so I availed myself of a local resource.

Id: [0x002ACDC3]
It was early, I did not wish to wake you.

Id: [0x002ACDC8]
Huh. As you are aware, Holger and I are neighbors. Near enough that I often catch him at my stables, stealing my tools.

Id: [0x002ACDC9]
Borrowing!

Id: [0x002ACDCB]
Stealing, borrowing … my point being, I have always allowed him to use whatever he pleased.

Id: [0x002ACDCC]
I greatly admire your Norse generosity and had hoped to match it. But this morning, Holger stretched the limits of my grace.

Id: [0x002ACDCD]
Entering my stables for their feed, I found my most beautiful, gentle mare stripped of her tail! Bereft! Not a strand in sight!

Id: [0x002ACDCE]
I am ashamed to say my natural suspicion drew me to Holger. And how right I was!

Id: [0x002ACDCF]
Painting, Rowan! I was painting! You make it sound so crude.

Id: [0x002ACDD5]
My horse looks a fool, Eivor! No handsomer than a donkey now. You must do something.

Id: [0x002ACDDE]
I borrowed the tail! Borrowed! Does the reality of regrowth not make this a victimless crime?

Id: [0x002ACDE1]
But the horse was not for sale! Rowan, admit it!

Id: [0x002ACDE7]
But--

Id: [0x002ACDE9]
This had best be a very good apology.

Id: [0x002ACDEA]
It will be! Ahem--

Id: [0x002ACDEB]
To you, O man of horses, I do offer my utmost apologies. And to Aelfgifu, most elegant of mares, I dedicate my finished work.

Id: [0x002ACDEC]
You are, respectively, a king of men and a queen of horses, and I exalt you. I … am … sorry.

Id: [0x002ACDED]
Mmff.

Id: [0x002ACDEF]
As much as it can. I accept the apology.

Id: [0x002ACE30]
Absolutely not. Silver is the only color I wish to see from you.

Id: [0x002ACE31]
I will return your tools and offer you one of my paintings as a sign of good will.

Id: [0x002ACE32]
Hmph. Unless your paintings can regrow horse tails, I have no use for them.

Id: [0x002ACE56]

Short days ago, I found a pile of mildew-stained detritus beneath the docks and salvaged what I could.

Id: [0x002ACE72]
Yet here she claims I have robbed and defaced her property, when all I took was rubbish left by to rot.

Id: [0x002ACE73]
Holger, what say you in your defense?

Id: [0x002ACE74]
Holger, what say you in your defense?

Id: [0x002ACE75]
My motives were honest, Eivor. Would a thief be so brazen as to display the fruits of his crime? Hardly.

Id: [0x002ACE76]
I might have profited from that cloth. Holger has all but robbed me of a future boon!

Id: [0x002ACE77]
It was garbage! Yet now it is part of something greater. If anything, I have increased its value. You ought to thank me.

O, I will thank you with the back of my--

Passing Holger's home, there I see it! Boldly displayed and worse … defaced! With scrawls and silly stories upon it.

Id: [0x002ACE7D]
Lies and slander!

Id: [0x002ACE7F]
I confronted him, demanding silver. For a sail with Holger's inky scratchings cannot be sold or bartered, can it?

Id: [0x002ACE80]
I ask only that I be paid for the property that was taken from me. Yet he refuses.

Id: [0x002ACE82]
That is right.

Id: [0x002ACE83]
Holger, quiet. You are well acquainted with the rules of this trial.

Id: [0x002ACE84]
Holger, quiet. You are well acquainted with the rules of this trial.

Id: [0x002ACE85]
So Holger took something that belonged to you and defaced it. Now you wish to be paid for the item. Do I understand?

Id: [0x002ACE86]
So Holger took something that belonged to you and defaced it. Now you wish to be paid for the item. Do I understand?

Id: [0x002ACE88]
Exactly, yes.

I see … so you feel Gudrun disposed of something and now unreasonably seeks its return.

After careful thought, it is clear that--

Holger and Gudrun are at odds. I hoped to find a resolution.

Holger and Gudrun are at odds. I hoped to find a resolution.

Id: [0x002ACE93]
You entered the well, did you not? And you found what you were looking for?

Id: [0x002ACE98]
That duty is mine alone, Eivor. You know this! Stand aside!

Id: [0x002ACE9A]
A sallow excuse for such a bold defiance. I hope you enjoyed it.

Id: [0x002ACE9C]
My jarl, as I was saying I was--

Id: [0x002ACE9D]
Stop! Enough! I have heard more than enough to render my judgment.

Id: [0x002ACE9E]
For as long as I have known you, Holger, you have spun words into lies.

Id: [0x002ACEA0]
I've shown you too many years of tolerance. And rather than exist in grateful meekness, as Holger the Liar, you sink lower.

Id: [0x002ACEA1]
Sigurd Jarl, no. Th-that is not the--

Id: [0x002ACEA2]
This is the consequence of your actions. You will pay Gudrun the value of thirty sailcloths…

Id: [0x002ACEA3]
Thirty times? Surely you jest! That would ruin me, Sigurd.

Id: [0x002ACEA6]
Do I look like one to play pranks, Holger? Pay the fee or be exiled!

Id: [0x002ACEA7]
Great jarl, if I may … I seek only compensation for a single sailcloth, the rest is--

Id: [0x002ACEA9]
Thirty times! In silver! That is my judgment.

Id: [0x002ACEAA]
Eivor, please … does this not seem unfair?

Id: [0x002ACEAD]
You were not here, Brother. Nor did I wish to bother you.

Id: [0x002ACEAE]
You were not here, Brother. Nor did I wish to bother you.

How dare you!

The longhouse. My crew should be inside.

May Christ, whose terror scares away the foul throngs, make with me a strong covenant.

Id: [0x002ACFB4]
I have invited you here to speak on equal terms. Do the Dane laws of hospitality not apply in Wessex?

Id: [0x002ACFB8]
Do all the priests in Wincestre have this same skill for drama?

Id: [0x002ACFB9]

Id: [0x002ACFBB]
A dull answer. But a battle-blunted axe may yet be sharpened.

I learned that my gods and yours inspire tales of equal amusement … they make me howl with laughter.

Yet through our Lord we may achieve life everlasting in His glorious presence. Perhaps you missed that detail.

A cruel punishment. Why do you stay?

He was a man of surpassing vigor, well versed in the Bible, quick of wit, oxen-strong, meek as a lamb.

Id: [0x002ACFD8]
But God called Eahlferth to sit beside him. And Ealhferth answered, his body gone to earth and his sister weeping. Mourning a lord far-known and beloved.

Id: [0x002ACFFE]
Only this and little more.

Id: [0x002AD005]
I would return him to you myself if I knew where they were holding him. But Fulke's treachery has blindsided me as well.

Id: [0x002AD009]
Very well. As much as you can carry.

Id: [0x002AD018]
Eivor. Compose yourself while you are my guest. My city is not a battlefield.

Sigurd! Stop this thing! Douse its fire!

Sigurd! Stop this thing! Douse its fire!

Perverter of justice! Who dares execute the king's noose?

Id: [0x002AD053]
Ah. You peer through the veil, but you do not see clearly.

Id: [0x002AD054]
Who best to judge the fate of the wretched many, if not the strong and worthy few?

Id: [0x002AD055]
It's not in Aelfred's name that you carry out your work. You are The Order's executioner.

He's here somewhere. I hear him calling to me, lonely and afraid. My poor, poor son.

Id: [0x002AD0D6]
I hear the din of your city.

Goodness! For parading her nakedness, was it?

Id: [0x002AD0EE]
Met him, fought him. He gave me this nick here. Maybe I can give him one back. Remind him some call me King Killer.

Id: [0x002AD0F0]
I'd like you both to be there. To guide me, to judge my fitness.

Id: [0x002AD0F4]
Give us your word then. Your blade stays in its sheath.

I am going to enjoy seeing him squeal, the old oak. Not nearly as much as taking him down, though. That would seal my legacy.

Id: [0x002AD106]
They like to spin in silence.

Burgred, my love!

My lady! Are you injured? Did they hurt you?

Id: [0x002AD10E]
No, no. I'm fine.

Id: [0x002AD112]
So I must caution you, step with care in this place. What happens here may ripple through the fabric of the nine worlds.

Id: [0x002AD114]
Please start again. Tell me all that has happened.

Id: [0x002AD115]
Please start again. Tell me all that has happened.

Rhodri's fled! It's war!

You clipped Aelfgifu's tail to the rump! Without asking!

Id: [0x002AD131]
Do not conflate hair with beauty, Rowan. She remains radiant. Aelfgifu's hair will grow back in no time.

Id: [0x002AD135]
You see? Such willful arrogance! It will take ages for Aelfgifu's tail to reach its former length. I demand compensation!

Dear Lord, this is a massacre!

Id: [0x002AD174]
Lord, forgive us.

Id: [0x002AD175]
Stay close, Ceolbert. You watch my back and I will pull the knives from yours!

Dag and I will go together.

When you are king, Ceolbert, you won't need battles. You will crave them.

Id: [0x002AD1B1]
You murdered Rhodri's brother, you beast! Our one chance at peace is lost!

Id: [0x002AD1BA]
Ah, the diplomat speaks what he really feels.

You see, aetheling? Eivor understands. There can be no peace with these backward Britons.

Id: [0x002AD1CC]
They will retreat to their great castle, for certain. It's well-nigh impregnable.

Id: [0x002AD1CE]
What's done is done. We must plan our next moves before the Britons regroup.

With enough materials and the right incentive, I pledge to build a tower so tall, it would shield all of Asgard.

You do not need me to hold your hand, Eivor. I will head to Wesberie, scout around.

Id: [0x002AD1D7]
I know your method of scouting. It always leads to swordplay.

Id: [0x002AD1DC]
I'll meet you both at Wesberie then, once I've done some damage. Until then.

Be kind, Justice-Bringer.

Freyja! My beloved!

Id: [0x002AD299]
If you're not careful, you may be the author of your own destruction.

Id: [0x002AD29C]
Two, now. The Bishop Ealhferth is dead. He was The Seax, so far as I can tell.

Id: [0x002AD29E]
And a humble servant of your God. That must sting.

Id: [0x002AD29F]
And a humble servant of your God. That must sting.

I may be. And why shouldn't I? I mean, he arrested Aelfred's man, didn't he? Got some stones on him!

Id: [0x002AD2A1]
Shut your mouth, yeah? Unless you want yours to rot off in the keep.

Id: [0x002AD2AC]
It's a brazen move to arrest Aelfred's favored reeve.

He did. It's a fine name.

He did. It is a fine name.

Let's not walk too far with that idea. I need you right where you are.

Yes, Dweller of the Fens. An apt name for his current fate.

Well, Eivor, when our three heretics smolder on a heap of ash, we'll down a cup of ale together and share our distaste of Mercians like old friends.

Roly-poly mutton man, you can't catch me!

Well?

Oi! Wigbert, you great moon-calf!

On the mountain, He walked with His disciples. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light.

Id: [0x002AD3C2]
At his tomb the earth shook and an angel appeared asking them why they looked for the living among the dead. He has risen!

Id: [0x002AD3D4]
Hurry it up! Get those crates aboard!

Id: [0x002AD3DC]
Do you believe in souls? A part of us that lives on with God after we die? Bishop Ealhferth's passing has made me wonder.

Id: [0x002AD3DE]
You see how easily our two clans dance and drink together?

We prosper together, and that is good. But Kjotve's clan will fight us to the death, tear at us from end to end.

Id: [0x002AD3E2]
See there? I etched his name in runes, on the outer bend. You'll show him?

Id: [0x002AD3E3]
Skal! (Cheers!)

And you have plunged my city into chaos. I had hoped you would use the lessons of your subtler gods.

O! It's you again!

No, but you were nice, so I will be nice too. You should talk to Aelwyn and Wigbert. They know everything.

I'm looking for The Quill.

Guided by Odin's sight, you are!

You are just like your father, little berserker! Skal to you!

Skal to Styrbjorn, the true King of Rygjafylke! Tonight we are all made anew! Skal!

I hewed the heads of joyless hel-dogs! I imbibed Odin's brew and I snipped the scraggly beards of troll-kings! I danced naked upon the bleaching beaches…

Id: [0x002AD4B9]
That's a good idea. We'll do that in the morning, at first light.[laughs]

No less than the King of Mercia, Brother. One of these days…

You have my thanks, all of you. And my blessing.

That's her! Dimwit Dane, Dimwit Dane! Didn't guess The Quill's a she!

Now, now, Aelwyn. Few have the wit that you and I possess. Most see the world in simpler terms, where we are the weaker sex.

Defend your mistress!

Those were The Quill's meatmops, and you sent them scurrying off with their tails between their legs.

They were The Quill's ninnypops. Smart stuff to throw coin at them, they'll be too squiffed to bother you now.

Id: [0x002AD6B6]
I am innocent as a lamb. They were The Quill's thugs, and you killed them. Wouldn't want to be in your boots.

Us? Working for The Quill? Shows what you know.

Go on, give her what you took. Maybe she can save us?

Good luck, Dane. Try not to get maimed and all that.

Come, child. Whisper what you've learned, and Mother will give you a treat.

Scarper! She's on to us.

Id: [0x002AD6F3]
To educate them!

Follow on, Lif. Birna and Galinn are safe at a camp we've made. Eivor … you meet us there when you're ready.

Id: [0x002AD823]
He lives by a strict code of honor, more than most. And builds the best longships I've ever sailed. They're the reason we escaped Grantebridge alive.

Id: [0x002AD824]
He's not the strongest man, but he's wise and canny and hard to pin down. Like a fish wriggling free of a net.

Birna has a genius for tactics, sees well ahead of things. Lif deals with what's just there before him. Practical in all ways.

Id: [0x002AD829]
Both have helped me find my footing in desperate times. It's important to keep those who disagree with you close as family.

Birna's like a grapevine, curly and hard to predict. While Lif's like a wood beam, sturdy, straightforward.

Lif and Galinn didn't always get along, but they've bonded since we took Grantebridge.

In a way. Both considered themselves my second and hated the other for it. But I do not rank my family like I do my horses.

Follow on, Birna. Lif and Galinn are safe at a camp we've made. Eivor … you meet us there when you're ready.

I'd tell you Birna was Loki in disguise if she had a scrap of subtlety in her.

We have a camp nearby, Galinn. I'll take you there myself. Eivor, join us when you're ready.

Id: [0x002AD84E]
Yes, and a man of the gods. He carries them around in his mind as a tree bears its branches.

It makes his mind heavy. But it keeps our spirits light, knowing the gods give us favor.

Enough! You've proven yourself.

Id: [0x002AD87B]
I must say I'm impressed. A test for the mind and the body. Take what you've earned.

Thank you. I will.

Thank you. I will.

Well! Look at this whelp! Not a lot of fight in you, is there?

O, do remind me, Faravid. Yesterday it was Halfdan. But today I hear whispers that you are leading the charge. I am … confused.

I should break your arms for that! What were you doing?

Id: [0x002AD8B4]
That serpent cannot be trusted, Eivor! If he tells Halfdan of our plan, our victory is at risk.

England is too infected with ugly memories. I will stay here, in the land that gave me life and strength.

Well … I hope, for your sake, that you grow well into the role you have earned today. That hope is all I have left.

And my grievances go back further still. You stole my father's riches. In my haste to leave, I should have stopped you then…

And I remember and admire the way you guided us from Norway to England. You kept my anger in check, my ambitions focused.

My king, we'll go by back streets to the Old Minster. Eivor may find us there when all has settled.

Who are you to judge a man of faith? You, a Dane who believes in giants and wolves that eat the sun? Begone!

Id: [0x002AE26E]
We both know your brother's faith was a cloak of lies. He used your God's words for his own ends.

Where is its home?

Id: [0x002AE27F]
You treated me with kindness, but this damned order. Their machinations killed my brother, so the rest may rot.

Id: [0x002AE284]
But why strike him down? Have you no compassion for good men!

Id: [0x002AE287]
He was not a Christian, he abhorred your god.

Id: [0x002AE288]
Ealhferth, my love! No!

Id: [0x002AE2A7]
You would force a vow of silence simply because God gave me an enquiring mind?

Id: [0x002AE2D5]
You have fine hair. It shimmers like … woven silk.

Id: [0x002AE2DC]
I'm in no mood for wind-belching. So choose your words well.

Id: [0x002AE2E4]
I'll send you to your heathen hell!

Ow! Why do you smite me so?

Id: [0x002AE2F7]
God's trews! Fie on you. What infernal wakes me?

Id: [0x002AE2FA]
And I do not care. Did you want something, or did you just wake me to torment me?

Id: [0x002AE2FC]
Were we? I was so ale-addled … perhaps a small and silver thing upon my palm might help me recall?

Id: [0x002AE2FE]
Alright! No need for that. You paint a vivid picture, Dane. He was headed to the white coast to the southeast. Dover Fortress.

There. Lif's longboat. I recognize the hull.

Id: [0x002AE37C]
This longboat is Birna's, I think. All scraped and bashed, it's hard to tell.

Id: [0x002AE3AF]
This is Galinn's longship. He must have been panicked to have strayed to such a place.

We had our chance!

We had our chance!

I'm grateful, Ceolbert. But my heart is heavy. So many homes burnt. We'll be years rebuilding.

Id: [0x002AE444]
Fuck you, Wolf-Kissed. I know Rhodri, and I know the kind of tricks he will pull. That is me warning you.

Id: [0x002AE445]
The good bishop is right, Ivarr. You have a warrior's heart, not a peacemaker's.

A mouthful of iron would put a stop to his babbling.

To Odin and his endless glories.

Ah, Eivor. Come, let me show you a wonder.

Id: [0x002AE4E8]
Not here. Let's get away from envious ears.

Id: [0x002AE530]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x002AE531]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x002AE53E]
Look, the moon! It moves untroubled now. But one day, it will be eaten by a giant wolf, and the nights will be black forevermore.

Yes. He hurt my mother to death, then took her good luck charm. Perhaps you found it? A little carved tree? It is all I have to remember her by.

Id: [0x002AE6CD]
He hurt many people.

Ah, Eivor …[laugh] the only mouth in Midgard from which I fear mockery.

How about another lesson, then? A quick flyt (word battle), right here, right now. What do you say?

Id: [0x002AE6D5]
Practicing your wordplay, Alvis?

Id: [0x002AE6D6]

But today, we'll abstain. Let me begin.

Id: [0x002AE6DB]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x002AE6DC]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x002AE6DD]
Interesting … you have the cadence correct. But you failed the rhyme.

Id: [0x002AE6DE]
It's as much about sound as it is about time.

Id: [0x002AE6DF]
So be careful in choosing the words that you say…

Id: [0x002AE6E0]
Hmm, no. The rhyme is good! But too many words upsets the rhythm.

Id: [0x002AE6E1]
That is the difficult part. Thinking quickly! You must learn that skill above all else.

Id: [0x002AE6E2]
A fine answer! Perfect rhyme and a lovely cadence to match my line.

Id: [0x002AE6E5]
He honored you today. Fought bravely, against many stalwart foes.

In flyting, you'll need to be cutting and keen.

Id: [0x002AE6E9]
It's about wielding wit more than venting your spleen.

Id: [0x002AE6EA]
If I tell you you're foolish, and stupid, and dull…

Id: [0x002AE6EB]
Need to get that brain working quicker, Eivor!

Id: [0x002AE6EC]
I haven't taught you enough if you think that line works! Where's the rhyme?

Id: [0x002AE6ED]
Think on your feet, Eivor. Saying nothing is like leaving yourself open for a blow!

Id: [0x002AE6EE]
So go then, and conquer the world with your wit!

Id: [0x002AE6EF]
Go be clever, be quick, show your spirit and grit!

Id: [0x002AE6F0]
I look eagerly forward to seeing how you fare…

Id: [0x002AE6F1]
Perfect, yes! You could destroy me with such a line!

Id: [0x002AE6F2]
Ehh! A good response! I called you stupid and you turned it around. Flyting about wit, you matched my meaning.

Id: [0x002AE6F3]
When you think of too many perfect retorts, use the one that best matches the meaning.

Id: [0x002AE6F5]
A good rhyme, but a bad structure. Close. You're close.

Id: [0x002AE6F7]
Not bad. Not bad. The rhyme is there, the sound is good, but … consider that I said you were silly, and you told me you would kill me.

Id: [0x002AE6F8]
At times, it might be best to … remain on-theme. Something to consider.

Id: [0x002AE6F9]
Happy to help you learn if you'd like to come back again.

Id: [0x002AE6FB]
Perhaps I will. Thank you, Alvis.

Id: [0x002AE6FC]
Perhaps I will. Thank you, Alvis.

Id: [0x002AE6FE]
You swing a fine axe, and you turn a good phrase!

Id: [0x002AE700]
Thank you, Alvis. I'll take the lesson to heart.

Id: [0x002AE701]
Thank you, Alvis. I'll take the lesson to heart.

Id: [0x002AE702]
I believe in you.

You return! Would you like to try again?

Good day, Alvis.

Id: [0x002AE713]
Of course. All of England will soon know that the Kingdom of Mercia has a new and powerful king.

Id: [0x002AE714]
Word of Burgred's deposition will spread quickly. The other kingdoms of England will soon enough know that Mercia has a new king.

Id: [0x002AE75C]
Agreed. Today we turn a new page. All of England must know … the Kingdom of Mercia has a new king.

Id: [0x002AE78A]
Take this, Wolf-Kissed. As a sign of friendship. And should you call, the Brothers Ragnarsson will come.

Id: [0x002AE78C]
You honor me, Ubba.

You're Birna.

See that? Sly bastard, trying to win your heart. Well, two can play at that game.

My pleasure. Our friendship is the best thing to come from this mess. Maybe Ceolbert too, the brave little twig.

Id: [0x002AE871]
Hang on. Are you asking … are you asking because I'm English?

Well, sure. I mean, you're a historian … an English historian. So I thought … yeah.

You have a second?

Yeah. Sure. What's on your mind?

How long ago did this precursor race die out?

Shaun, what the hell did we see in that video? The Isu … blood transfusions … a cataclysm.

All that and more. Another Isu attempt to live beyond death.

Wanted to ensure the place was up to snuff. We must talk again soon, Randvi, once I'm settled.

My heaviest reagents, of course. Lead, whalebone, flecks of gold.

Nothing of the sort. I'm Moira of Wyke, Halfdan's herbalist. He is an ill man, and I do what I can to give succor and hope.

Faravid has left the feast already, heading for his camp upriver. Join his war band. And behind his back, dig.

Steady all. And ready yourself for the wedding race, the king and his bride against all!

Id: [0x002AE936]
Oswald! King of sheep-fuckers! Show your eyes!

Id: [0x002AE938]
I challenge you!

Id: [0x002AE947]
I accept.

Oswald is king, and a king must have a champion. I will fight in his stead.

You dog![laugh] That was some trick you pulled!

Id: [0x002AEA67]
We place great importance on mathematics, children. Who can tell me why?

Id: [0x002AEA68]
So that I may always count how many eggs Mistress Featherton has laid.

It is a great thing to shape young minds.

Do you speak Latin? Magister Bata says I cannot play until I learn "I will not eat apples in class." Urm … ego … poma…

If I learn my letters, will I marry a noble thegn?

Id: [0x002AEA87]
What is five plus two plus six plus four blackberry pies? A lot of baking.

Id: [0x002AEA88]
I remember you! You saved us from Hilda. You are a great warrior.

Id: [0x002AEA89]
I never want to see those smelly sewers again. Even if that means listening to Magister Bata all day.

Id: [0x002AEA8A]
It's you! The Hero of Wincestre! Didn't you used to be taller?

Id: [0x002AEA8B]
My poor head. It's full of things I'll never need. Like Pythagoras and good manners.

Id: [0x002AEA8E]
Latin, urgh. I just want to tell stories about hellsome beasts and brave adventurers. "Fie, fie beastie! Be thee dead?  I'll grind your bones to make my bread."

Id: [0x002AEA8F]
Shhh, I am reading.

Id: [0x002AEA90]
I'd be careful calling this one friend, Faravid. The crow who comes flapping when Halfdan gives a whistle.

Id: [0x002AEA96]
Lend me a knife, Faravid. This whelp needs gelding.

Id: [0x002AEA97]
Lend me a knife, Faravid. This whelp needs gelding.

Mmmm. Yes, it's good.

Id: [0x002AEAD8]
Gods….

That's worth a verse or two in some skald's song. I'll remember that for all time, Eivor.

I will too, Broder.

I will too, Broder.

The mad heretic?

Eivor, welcome to the West Market.

Id: [0x002AEB4A]
Poor Ceolbert. He barely said a word.

Heh, ja. You know exactly what we're about.

No appeal to your god? Or your king?

Id: [0x002AEB8D]
It was like they burst out of the center of the city itself! Setting aflame everything in their path, shouting some nonsense about an ancient order of warriors.

Id: [0x002AEB8E]
They just appeared in the city?

Id: [0x002AEB8F]
They just appeared in the city?

Our jarlskona, Soma, she bellowed a retreat and we took refuge in the ruins. But in the chaos, we were separated.

She'll be deep in the fog of the Fenlands by now. Find her longship. That's your best bet.

I can find Soma. Be ready when we return.

You think those Danes will ever stop coming for us?

Id: [0x002AF413]
You'd think killing Rhodri's brother shoulda been enough for 'em.

Id: [0x002AF417]
Let us begin.

Id: [0x002AF418]
Let's begin.

Id: [0x002AF419]
What a perfect figure you have … poised, powerful, perfect.

Id: [0x002AF41B]
You're brilliant. Are you certain I can't convince you to tarry a moment? We could go somewhere and--

Id: [0x002AF41E]
It appears we've underestimated him.

Id: [0x002AF420]
I live to serve, Raven-Feeder.

On your advice. Find some way to hinder his efforts or I will offer you as his prize.

Id: [0x002AF439]
Welcome back, Shield Shaker.

Id: [0x002AF446]
…Dvalin, Bivor, Bavor, Bombur, Nori, An and Anar, Ai, Mjothvitnir, Veig and Gandalf, Vindalf, Thrain, Thekk and Thorin, Thror, Vit, and Lit, Nar and Nyrath, Regin and Rathsvith …

Id: [0x002AF583]
Swift and strong you may be. It's the one most righteous who wins the fight.

Id: [0x002AF584]
A bold claim! I'll drink to that.

Id: [0x002AF585]
He's under my ever watchful eye, while my hugr spins even more snares for our busy builder. How do you use your time?

Id: [0x002AF587]
Doubt not that I shall double my deceptive efforts, O Lord of Cruelty.

Then come and see! What fate do these dice hold for you?

Id: [0x002AF5B0]
Halfdan will be waiting for his gift in Donecaestre. Don't keep him waiting.

Id: [0x002AF5B5]
A hidden fact known only to you, Far-Seer, that I may share in your secret knowledge of the world.

Id: [0x002AF5B6]
Such as?

I should see Moira about this brew she's been feeding Halfdan.

I should see Moira about this brew she's been feeding Halfdan.

Id: [0x002AF5F8]
Yet here you are, barking again.

Id: [0x002AF5F9]
Because we beg for scraps from Halfdan's table. Like dogs.

Id: [0x002AF62D]
Moira's not here.

Id: [0x002AF62E]
Moira's not here.

Id: [0x002AF64F]
Ah, you're in luck then, for I have found the man already. I'm only waiting on him to get married.

Id: [0x002AF65B]
I sent myself. I want to speak with Finnr, the steward who should be working to put a king on that throne.

Id: [0x002AF65C]
I sent myself. I want to speak with Finnr, the steward who should be working to put a king on that throne.

Let's pretend Halfdan did send me. Then we pretend you're Finnr, his steward of East Anglia.

Let's pretend Halfdan did send me. Then we pretend you're Finnr, his steward of East Anglia.

This was our first camp in Northumbria. I came here with Halfdan and his brothers, Ubba and Ivarr.

A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. Does Magister Bata not teach you the scriptures?

Magister Bata is a horse's dangles.

Id: [0x002AF6F5]
Right…

Id: [0x002AF6F9]
You know, stranger, you interrupted a beautiful dream. I was sailing through Helheim, drifting on a ship of fire.

O, wouldn't that be a burden off my shoulders.

Id: [0x002AF730]
Charge!

Id: [0x002AF731]
For Oswald!

Id: [0x002AF734]
It sounds like you owe me your life.

Where's your resolve, lord? Stop whining and attack me.

Id: [0x002AF75A]
A Dane in Wincestre? These are strange times.

Whose business? The Quill's?

Id: [0x002AF763]
Whose business? The Quill's?

Id: [0x002AF765]
Or gets you noticed, by The Quill for example. Does he pay you well to do his dirty work?

So you're not working for The Quill?

So you're not working for The Quill?

Id: [0x002AF777]
Ah, that'd be Rued's clan. They killed the last man I put here, Aethelstan. I suspect they'll do the same to our next monarch.

Id: [0x002AF789]
A Dane who can't keep the Danes in line? Not much of a steward, are you?

I am grateful for your help.

Id: [0x002AF7BB]
If I knew how, I'd have rid our lands of them long ago! Rued's clan plagues us all, Dane and Saxon alike.

Id: [0x002AF7DE]
I need help with this gate!

Id: [0x002AF7DF]
I need help with this gate!

Id: [0x002AF806]
You dare call yourself drengr (a courageous warrior)! Face me, battle-swine! I'll take your head for a trophy!

Id: [0x002AF81C]
I will enjoy this!

Id: [0x002AF823]
You just missed him. He's headed for Elmenham just now, pleading once again for peace.

Id: [0x002AF82C]
Where is he now? I'll get the measure of him, see what I can do.

Id: [0x002AF82D]

Id: [0x002AF830]
To the ships!

Id: [0x002AF860]
You fight well, heathen.

Id: [0x002AF861]
Not bad yourself, Saxon.

Id: [0x002AF863]
Praise the All-Father. Oswald lives!

Id: [0x002AF86E]
The Picts raided that monastery, plundered its silver and gold.

Id: [0x002AF870]
Yes, monasteries make tempting targets, and not just for us. We tracked Pictish raiders heading north.

Id: [0x002AF872]
To open their bellies with my knife.

Id: [0x002AF876]
If I help with your fight against the Picts, Halfdan will consider me a friend. So point the way, Faravid.

Cautious? He was always leery, but now fear's gnawed him down to the bone.

Nothing I have seen gives me reason to doubt you. But Halfdan, he seems a cautious man.

A Dane treads the cobbles of God's house. In search of Christ's redemption, I hope.

Blessed are those who find wisdom. Return when you have it, heathen.

Has His light brought illumination to your darkness? Speak His story.

Stop that ship from sailing!

Ha! Look at you, face like a stuffed beaver.

Id: [0x002AF91F]
Good morrow, good morrow!

Id: [0x002AF92A]
And here is the axe I used to swat a fly.

If The Gallows is truly dead, perhaps we can allow cautious revelry?

We have no subtle gods.

Forgive my outburst. God sowed in me a passion, but English prose is an instrument long out of tune.

Id: [0x002AF938]
We all want better for our people, don't we, Eivor? Yours and ours?

Id: [0x002AF940]
The decay of learning has been gentle in Wessex. We enjoy the office of wise men, but we have neglected the study of wisdom.

Id: [0x002AF942]
The Quill remains. What do we know?

Id: [0x002AF943]
The Quill remains. What do we know?

Id: [0x002AF944]
Some say their hugr enters the items they craft, others believe they live on in song. Personally, I don't give a rat's ass for philosophy.

Id: [0x002AF945]
The Quill preys on this lapse.

Id: [0x002AF94A]
I did. The Quill is calling the children of Wincestre to arms.

Id: [0x002AF987]
Eadwyn's men did this. They killed brother Paul and took my stone.

Id: [0x002AF98E]
This moves.

Id: [0x002AF98F]
It must be there!

Id: [0x002AF9BF]
Please, please. My aunt came here for her cough. She never returned. It's been days, I must see her.

Id: [0x002AF9C2]
I see you, child. Come.

Id: [0x002AF9C3]
I see you, child. Come.

Id: [0x002AF9CD]
Get out. And don't come around here again.

Id: [0x002AFA17]
Our city is overrun with cowards. We may be next to fall if we don't resolve this sick fermentation of hate.

Id: [0x002AFA1B]
I've told you, this city answers to blood and power. We should serve as such.

Id: [0x002AFA24]
We have one half of our bargain done, Birstan. I will return with news of the other.

Id: [0x002AFA25]
We have one half of our bargain done, Birstan. I will return with news of the other.

Id: [0x002AFA33]
We need to go. Fast!

Id: [0x002AFA34]
We need to go. Fast!

Id: [0x002AFA40]
Soldiers! Eadwyn's here.

Id: [0x002AFA51]
Eivor. Have you dealt Eadwyn a few bruising blows?

Id: [0x002AFA55]
I have. She'll feel the pain soon enough.

Id: [0x002AFA56]
I have. She'll feel the pain soon enough.

Id: [0x002AFA7A]
On account of Eadwyn's got too many traps and defenses.

Id: [0x002AFA7C]
By my joints and ankles, you're a tough one.

Id: [0x002AFA7D]
Why is that?

Id: [0x002AFA7E]
Why is that?

Id: [0x002AFA7F]
Keep the men at the ready. I'll slip in alone and see what I can do about these defenses.

Id: [0x002AFA80]
Keep the men at the ready. I'll slip in alone and see what I can do about these defenses.

Id: [0x002AFABB]
I wish somebody'd chase these Britons out of here.

Id: [0x002AFABC]
This war is endless. Who cares who's our lord? The sheep must be shorn either way.

Id: [0x002AFABD]
Galinn, you look terrible.

Id: [0x002AFAC0]
Saxons chased me into the fog, ran me smack into a nest of bandits. But Freyr was on my side, and I saw them before they saw me.

Id: [0x002AFAC2]
Are you the only one of your crew left standing?

Id: [0x002AFAC3]
I am. And hardly standing myself. But with the blessings of Odin and Freyja, they'll be feasting well with the gods.

Id: [0x002AFAC5]
What happened here?

Id: [0x002AFAC6]
What happened here?

Id: [0x002AFAD2]
It varies with the item. But there is a small hitch.

Id: [0x002AFAD3]
What sort of fee?

Id: [0x002AFAD4]
What sort of fee?

Id: [0x002AFADC]
Ha! Soma! I knew I heard someone sweeping the hearth outside.

Id: [0x002AFAEB]
Through this market, all prices are paid … in opal.

Id: [0x002AFAFA]
You may hold it and keep it, Eivor. A gift from Reda for your immeasurable hospitality.

Id: [0x002AFAFD]
Interesting … what a strange color it has. May I hold it?

Id: [0x002AFAFE]
Interesting … what a strange color it has. May I hold it?

Id: [0x002AFB02]
Now look here! Browse what wares I have on offer.

Id: [0x002AFB04]
Rarer than an honest man in England! You must keep your eyes open for this mineral! It has great value.

Id: [0x002AFB2D]
Refuse this and your shame will stain the name of your sons, and their sons beyond.

Id: [0x002AFB2E]
Refuse this and your shame will stain the name of your sons, and their sons beyond.

Id: [0x002AFB32]
Take the gift! We have bigger problems.

Id: [0x002AFB38]
Just outside the Northwic walls, by the water's edge.

Id: [0x002AFB39]
Aye. Sniffing around the outer walls, looking for an easy way to slip a few dozen men inside.

Id: [0x002AFB3E]
If there's one scout, there will be more. Something you might have learned if you kept him alive.

Id: [0x002AFB4E]
I was passing water when he surprised me. It was either him or my plow-sword!

Id: [0x002AFB50]
Valdis is right, there will be others.

Id: [0x002AFB51]
Valdis is right, there will be others.

Id: [0x002AFB53]
We'll have to act fast if we expect to find others.

Id: [0x002AFB54]
You did what you had to, Brothir. This one's better off dead.

Id: [0x002AFB55]
You did what you had to, Brothir. This one's better off dead.

Id: [0x002AFB58]
Where did you find this one?

Id: [0x002AFB59]
Where did you find this one?

Id: [0x002AFB68]
Jesus. Find another scout, we'll question him.

Id: [0x002AFB6C]
I'll look around. The rest of you stay here and out of sight. If I find anyone suspicious, I'll bring him here.

Id: [0x002AFB6D]
I'll look around. The rest of you stay here and out of sight. If I find anyone suspicious, I'll bring him here.

Id: [0x002AFB91]
Shoulda stayed in Donecaestre. More mead, fewer Picts.

Id: [0x002AFB92]
There's no glory in guard duty. Move out!

Id: [0x002AFBB7]
It might be Halfdan and his heathens. Hurry away now, and tell the men in Stenwege to take heed.

Id: [0x002AFBBB]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002AFBBC]
Do you not see I am in prayer?

Id: [0x002AFBC1]
For God's Spirit breathed on the waters, and in the Jordan River, Jesus was cleansed of all sin.

Id: [0x002AFBD2]
What now?

Id: [0x002AFBD3]
Why won't you leave me alone!

Id: [0x002AFBF2]
That was a clean result?

Id: [0x002AFBF5]
I'm not yet king. So I'll listen to my people before deciding what tone to take.

Id: [0x002AFBF9]
You handled that well. Disputes between Saxon and Dane don't always end so cleanly.

Id: [0x002AFBFA]
You handled that well. Disputes between Saxon and Dane don't always end so cleanly.

Id: [0x002AFBFE]
Halfdan's share shrinks after each victory. Like his cock, eh?

Id: [0x002AFC01]
Becs, are you seeing this?

Id: [0x002AFC02]
Yeah, it's weird. An anomaly of some kind. The rest of your simulation is frozen.

Id: [0x002AFC03]
I can see a loose data packet close by. I'll see if I can reach it.

Id: [0x002AFC04]
Okay, but take it slow. We don't know what this thing is.

Id: [0x002AFC05]
Becs, I found another anomaly.

Id: [0x002AFC06]
Is that what we're calling them?

Id: [0x002AFC07]
And another data packet. Should I get it?

Id: [0x002AFC0D]
Anomaly four. Becs, you really have to hear this in here. Two voices, definitely Isu. One of them is Aletheia, I think.

Id: [0x002AFC0F]
From the staff?

Id: [0x002AFC10]
Yeah. But I don't think these are contemporary. They feel candid. Accidental.

Id: [0x002AFC11]
Here we go again.

Id: [0x002AFC12]
Hey, it's Shaun here. Hum… Becs is trying to cook up a trace of some kind. Hoping to find out where this raw data is coming from.

Id: [0x002AFC13]
It's not in Eivor's DNA is it?

Id: [0x002AFC14]
Can't be. Feels too deliberate. Like someone wants you to see it.

Id: [0x002AFC16]
Layla. How are you holding up?

Id: [0x002AFC1F]
Shaun. These memory-stream fragments I'm finding … are they adding up to anything?

Id: [0x002AFC21]
Dammit.

Id: [0x002AFC22]
Anomaly number nine. Feeling okay? Any adverse effects?

Id: [0x002AFC27]
Last anomaly. This is it.

Id: [0x002AFC28]
I'm keeping a close watch on you. Don't do anything weird or sudden, okay?

Id: [0x002AFC29]
I won't. And pull me out if you see anything strange. Anything at all.

Id: [0x002AFC2A]
Becs, I'm closing in on the data packet.

Id: [0x002AFC2B]
I see it. It's encrypted, but nothing I can't handle.

Id: [0x002AFC2D]
Holy shit. What is that?

Id: [0x002AFC2E]
I have a few guesses, and all of them are wild. I'll upload this to the server.

Id: [0x002AFC30]
Dammit. Well, I'm at the second packet. You ready?

Id: [0x002AFC31]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x002AFC35]
Hey, Becs! Layla's back! I see her here … blipping and bleeping on your monitor.

Id: [0x002AFC36]
No luck?

Id: [0x002AFC3C]
Layla, it's Shaun. I'm sifting through the videos you've been finding. This is an absolute gold mine, I hope you realize.

Id: [0x002AFC3D]
Feels like it.

Id: [0x002AFC3E]
This is literally the clearest raw memory-stream footage we've ever seen from the Isu era.

Id: [0x002AFC41]
Becs, any progress?

Id: [0x002AFC42]
Nothing yet. Whoever put these here made a surgical incision into our server. They dumped this data and backed out before anyone noticed.

Id: [0x002AFC4C]
You're getting good at these, Layla.

Id: [0x002AFC4F]
Not bad, Shaun. Working on your kennings?

Ha! That showed them!

Id: [0x002AFCA4]
You again. You should mind your own beeswax.

Id: [0x002AFCA6]
It should be ours, we did the work! All of it. And nothing for Halfdan, warming his cock in a Saxon castle.

Id: [0x002AFCBB]
Sorry, friend, but that's Halfdan's take. You understand.

Id: [0x002AFCBE]
Open that cask and we'll have a taste. We'll celebrate, together.

If you insist, we'll all drink some stinking wine.

Don't make me say it twice. Crack the wine and drink with me.

Wedding preparations. Elmenham is on guard as we ready my marriage to the Dane woman Valdis. She's a cousin of Halfdan's.

What begs your attention in Elmenham?

We're stronger together, do not let them break us.

The voices in those Animus anomalies. One of them is Aletheia, but the other, I just don't know.

Id: [0x002AFE6E]
How well do you know Aletheia?

Id: [0x002AFE6F]
She talked to me before, through the staff. Ran me through some tests, simulations. But I don't know if I passed or failed.

Id: [0x002AFE70]
It's definitely Aletheia in those anomalies. I can't make out that other voice.

Id: [0x002AFE71]
I had a listen. Feels like we're hearing conversations from the Isu era.

Id: [0x002AFE72]
That's unheard of.

Id: [0x002AFE73]
Becs, you watched the Anomaly video?

Oh, sorry, I'm just working through something right now. Can we talk later?

Some quality stuff here.

Don't ask her that! Not while Holger is singing.

Have I not heard this song before? Or do all Norse songs sound alike?

Please, whatever you learn from us, do not judge our people by the sound of Holger's warbling.

Id: [0x002AFEF0]
He is doing us a service with his singing.

Id: [0x002AFEF1]
Making us deaf?

Id: [0x002AFEF4]
Reda, you are like no child I have ever met.

Id: [0x002AFEF5]
I had the same thought. You speak with such wisdom for a young man. An old soul in a new body.

Id: [0x002AFEF6]
Not so new as you might think. I could be your grandfather.

Id: [0x002AFEFC]
I've never been much for ale, nor anything that unsteadies my hands, but this is delicious! You are a wonder, Tekla.

Id: [0x002AFEFD]
Hints of honey and flowers. Wonderful.

Id: [0x002AFEFE]
You are too kind, all of you. But I could not have brewed this batch without Tarben's help.

Id: [0x002AFEFF]
O, no. It was nothing, really.

Id: [0x002AFF01]
Look at you! Can't accept a word of praise. Slapping it away like a playful cat.

Id: [0x002AFF04]
Eck, this fish is off. Has a ripeness I can hardly stomach.

Id: [0x002AFF05]
All right, quit your whining then. Leave it for the rest of us.

Id: [0x002AFF06]
Ah, I mean no offense! I am simply more accustomed to a Mediterranean diet. Grapes, olives, shellfish and the like.

Id: [0x002AFF07]
Right. How is that working out for you in England? Getting your fill of olives?

Id: [0x002AFF08]
Eh. From time to time, yes. My lover Julia sends me some as often as she can.

Id: [0x002AFF0D]
Of course. I cannot imagine. The savagery of that woman, Fulke.

Id: [0x002AFF0F]

Id: [0x002AFFFA]
Perfect! Yes!

O, scraps of nonsense. I woke to screaming. A man grabbed me, said I was an immediate danger to my father. Ha. Horsepucky!

Mercian soldiers then shackled me, rode me blindfolded to the river Wash and told me plainly: start anew elsewhere or face death in Lincolnscire.

O, some nonsense about me praying for his death, hungry for his inheritance.

Id: [0x002B0057]
No, never!

No, I suspect the order for my exile came from on high. Perhaps one of Burgred's final orders before he was deposed.

Perhaps you're right, he's too contained. It must have been King Aelfred, then.

Id: [0x002B005F]

My presence alone won't sway the family of your intended bride. That's work you must do yourself.

It takes more than a feast to impress a Dane. If you want to marry into this family, you must become one as well.

I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x002B013D]
I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x002B0141]
I'd be a troll's groom if it helped the people of this kingdom. Only tell me how.

Id: [0x002B0154]
When the brazier's lit at the Dunwic, Rued and his men will rally. They mean to attack Northwic by its weakest wall.

Id: [0x002B016C]
The crown suits, Oswald. Like it was meant for you and you for it.

Id: [0x002B016D]
The crown suits, Oswald. Like it was meant for you and you for it.

Id: [0x002B016E]
And Valdis?

Id: [0x002B016F]
And Valdis?

Id: [0x002B0179]
As goes the crown, so goes East Anglia. Our crops and livestock prosper. And there's harmony between Saxons and Danes.

Id: [0x002B017A]
Our marriage is blooming. And she tells me our family will soon grow. By next summer.

Id: [0x002B01AF]
You English Danes are soft as butter now.

Id: [0x002B01D3]
You promised he'd go free!

Id: [0x002B01D5]
You've served your purpose. Time to die.

Id: [0x002B01D6]
You've served your purpose. Time to die.

Id: [0x002B01D7]
I built myself a home here! Rued's clan attacked us as well!

Id: [0x002B01D8]
O how nice to have a home to speak of, man! Mine was burned to the ground years ago! And by whom, I wonder?

Id: [0x002B01DC]
So what of these Danes attacking us, eh? What will you do about them?

Id: [0x002B01E0]
That wasn't necessary.

Id: [0x002B01E2]
That's enough to go on. Time to die.

Id: [0x002B01E3]
That's enough to go on. Time to die.

Id: [0x002B01E9]
He may still be of value to us if he--

Id: [0x002B01EA]
He may still be of value to us if he--

Id: [0x002B01F8]
The hornets have led us to their nest. More than a chief up there.

Id: [0x002B01F9]
Halfdan thinks not. And the Picts may use that to their advantage.

Id: [0x002B01FE]
Let's find out.

Id: [0x002B01FF]
Let's find out.

Id: [0x002B0215]
Better than her brothers too. She charged into battle without fear.

Id: [0x002B021F]
She stormed Burgh Castle, brought Rued to his knees. And let Oswald hold him for trial?

Id: [0x002B0221]
I could hardly believe my ears either.

Id: [0x002B0222]
It was Oswald's wishes.

Id: [0x002B0240]
Behold! How light-footed I am!

Id: [0x002B0242]
You're as light-footed as a bear in a birch tree!

Id: [0x002B024A]
These are the moves of Elmenham!

Id: [0x002B024D]
Yes, to celebrate. Skal! Drink more!

Id: [0x002B024E]
Skal? Is that what you say?

Id: [0x002B0272]
You're on the wrong side of the giants' wall, friend. Have you come to make war in wint--

Id: [0x002B0273]

Fool! He might have talked!

Fool! He might have talked!

Id: [0x002B027F]
I've never seen this church look so beautiful.

Id: [0x002B0280]
Oswald designed it himself. Handpicked all the decorations here.

Id: [0x002B0287]
Look there, Finnr on the roof!

Id: [0x002B0288]
The road to Valhalla does not run that way Finnr!

Id: [0x002B028B]
Eivor, Eivor. Some sweet wine for a sweet swine. Come join me!

Id: [0x002B0294]
You're very strong.

Id: [0x002B0296]
Y-you're very large.

Id: [0x002B0297]
Y-you're very large.

Id: [0x002B029A]
Yes! That's it!

Id: [0x002B02F3]
This night remains glorious.

Id: [0x002B02F5]
All day long, all I hear is Brothir this and Brothir that. How strong he is, how handsome. It's always Brothir, Brothir, Brothir…

Id: [0x002B0305]
…so I told the Dane, "You get the wool while the Saxon gets his milk." They'll trade with each other, and when the time comes, we will make it into a good stew for everyone.

Id: [0x002B0307]
Quick, Brother!

Id: [0x002B0318]
We can't lose to Oswald!

Id: [0x002B0319]
You think in such a strange way.

Id: [0x002B032F]
You like sheep?

Id: [0x002B0330]
I hate it, actually. When we make that stew, you can have my bowl.

Id: [0x002B034A]
It's good that Oswald married a Dane. I'm tired of fighting.

Id: [0x002B034B]
I know, Mother. Maybe peace is the way of things now.

Id: [0x002B034D]
How better to hide than behind a bishop's robes? He is no man of God. He serves The Order.

Id: [0x002B034E]
How better to hide than behind a bishop's robes? He is no man of God. He serves The Order.

Id: [0x002B0350]
Heresy! My brother was the bishop of Wincestre!

Id: [0x002B0351]
Your brother is The Seax. And no more dead than I am.

Id: [0x002B0352]
Your brother is The Seax. And no more dead than I am.

Id: [0x002B035A]
There is no longer freedom in Wincestre.

Id: [0x002B035B]
None are safe from his blade.

Id: [0x002B035F]
When Goodwin got too close to the truth about your brother's place in The Order, you buried him.

Id: [0x002B0360]
When Goodwin got too close to the truth about your brother's place in The Order, you buried him.

Id: [0x002B0361]
How did you … no … I--

Id: [0x002B0362]
I, no, you cannot just…

Id: [0x002B0364]
I'll send a message to Halfdan in the North. He'll be pleased to know that a king now sits upon East Anglia's troubled throne.

Id: [0x002B0367]
I will not tell you any more. Guards!

Id: [0x002B0369]
Why does Aelfred not do something? Selwyn's bloodlust will doom us all.

Id: [0x002B036A]
Selwyn punishes criminals, as it should be.

Id: [0x002B036B]
He is the worst criminal of them all!

Id: [0x002B036C]
Those who do wrong must be punished.

Id: [0x002B036D]
Jesus would preach forgiveness!

Id: [0x002B037B]
Jesus did not live in the cesspool that is Wincestre.

Id: [0x002B0381]
I just want to read the epic stories, like the poems about hideous monsters and great warriors.

Id: [0x002B0382]
There will be time enough for tall tales. First, you will tell me all the declensions of the Latin verb "to speak."

Id: [0x002B0383]
Latin! Urgh! That language is so boring, it killed off all the Romans.

Id: [0x002B0391]
Not her. She wasn't half as ferocious as Aelwyn.

Id: [0x002B0394]
O, my days, I'm not sure my mind is big enough for all this knowledge.

Id: [0x002B0395]
The Quill?

Id: [0x002B0396]
The Quill?

Id: [0x002B0397]
What happened to your sister? Is she around?

Id: [0x002B0398]
What happened to your sister? Is she around?

Id: [0x002B0399]
Ah, it's you. Please don't be angry. She made me do it!

Id: [0x002B039F]
Time will tell. And one day, sooner or in the far future, I may return to England to witness what you have made.

Id: [0x002B03A3]
I hope you will. And I hope you will see that I have not led us astray.

Id: [0x002B03A4]
I hope you will. And I hope you will see that I have not led us astray.

Id: [0x002B03A5]
Set some here, near the silo! Light them up when the Saxon dogs arrive!

Id: [0x002B03A8]
So this is what you chose?

Id: [0x002B03A9]
So this is what you chose?

Id: [0x002B03AA]
It's you. Did you find dear Leof? It is lonely without him.

Id: [0x002B03AC]
Styrbjorn, please, before you drown yourself in ale.

Id: [0x002B03AD]
Styrbjorn, please, before you drown yourself in ale.

Id: [0x002B03AF]
His sister knows more than she lets on…

Id: [0x002B03B0]
His sister knows more than she lets on…

Id: [0x002B03B2]
Why? What has happened?

Id: [0x002B03B3]
I'm not here for that old business. I have come to tell you of Sigurd.

Id: [0x002B03B4]
I'm not here for that old business. I have come to tell you of Sigurd.

Id: [0x002B03B6]
Get away from me, demon.

Id: [0x002B03BA]
Leave me alone, I cannot betray my brother.

Id: [0x002B03C3]
Sigurd has decided to remain here, in Norway. But I cannot promise you will see him again. That will be up to him.

Id: [0x002B03C4]
Sigurd has decided to remain here, in Norway. But I cannot promise you will see him again. That will be up to him.

After some thought, he decided to return to England. With me, to be with his clan.

Id: [0x002B03C7]
After some thought, he decided to return to England. With me, to be with his clan.

Id: [0x002B03C8]
Ah. Good. In our last meeting, his attitude seemed so … so final.

Id: [0x002B03C9]
But you are together, as you should be. I am glad. Very glad.

Id: [0x002B03D2]
In this moment, yes. But, ah, you feel that? The moment has passed. We are free to pursue the next. What a gift!

Id: [0x002B03D6]
You're in high spirits, all things considered. The ambush, losing your home…

Id: [0x002B03D7]
You're in high spirits, all things considered. The ambush, losing your home…

Id: [0x002B040D]
I see. And what are his plans? To live on his own? Or pledge himself to Harald?

Id: [0x002B0410]
Agreed. It's good to fight beside you, Lif.

Id: [0x002B0411]
Agreed. It's good to fight beside you, Lif.

Do you enjoy your lessons? Latin, mathematics, grammar…

Id: [0x002B0419]

Id: [0x002B042A]
You are poor, Wigbert. What use have you for Latin?

Id: [0x002B0430]
O, then what is the use of learning anything?

Id: [0x002B0450]
Leave me to my grief.

Id: [0x002B045A]
I will leave you in peace, then.

Id: [0x002B045B]
I will leave you in peace, then.

Id: [0x002B046C]
To renew himself. That is all I know for sure.

Id: [0x002B046D]
To renew himself. That is all I know for sure.

Id: [0x002B0484]
Why are you doing this?

Id: [0x002B0488]
Hands tacky with old blood from the new king. It would be best to lie low.

Id: [0x002B0489]
Hands tacky with old blood from the new king. It would be best to lie low.

Id: [0x002B048F]
Indeed. The Saxons pursued me, ran me bloody through the swamps and into the lap of bandits … then the wolves came.

Id: [0x002B0490]
Many thanks. You were in a tight spot when we found you.

Id: [0x002B0491]
Many thanks. You were in a tight spot when we found you.

Id: [0x002B0499]
We all have our One Day, the day we die.  How you greet that day is all that matters. I'm proud to say that I was ready.

Id: [0x002B04A2]
I was a father to you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B04A3]
He saw his father for what he truly was. A coward who faced his enemies with more honesty than he did his family.

Id: [0x002B04A4]

Id: [0x002B04B7]
I wish you well, Sigurd, in spite of all that has happened. I hope you find what you seek. And that it brings you peace.

Id: [0x002B04BC]
Tears of Freyja…

Id: [0x002B04BD]
Tears of Freyja…

Id: [0x002B04BE]
A dragon on the hilt. Gods. The Briton crest.

Id: [0x002B04D4]
We fought with our weaselly ealdorman for years. Now his widow wants to lop off our heads.

Id: [0x002B04DB]
What happened yesterday? You and Sigurd disappeared during the feast.

Id: [0x002B04DC]
And when he returned, he went straight to our room, without a word.

Id: [0x002B04DE]
Do you think Sigurd knows? About us?

Id: [0x002B04E1]
Yet he does speak with you. With me, he has gone totally silent.

Id: [0x002B04E2]
So … what now?

Id: [0x002B04E3]
We talked for a time. I asked many questions but got few answers. I wish I could say more.

Id: [0x002B04E4]

I don't think so. He would have said something.

Sigurd wants to blame me for every mishap that has befallen him, but gives me no credit for his rescue. I don't understand.

Sigurd wants to blame me for every mishap that has befallen him, but gives me no credit for his rescue. I don't understand.

Id: [0x002B04F1]
Does it?

Id: [0x002B04F3]
Yes, it must be. Growing up, we never wanted for anything in my father's home. Bread and poultry and field fruits of all manner.

Id: [0x002B04F4]
I suppose this is where our servants purchased them. Lincoln's boon was ours as well.

Id: [0x002B04F6]
Lincoln seems a good place to trade.

How often did you leave your house, Hunwald?

Id: [0x002B04FB]
How often did you leave your house, Hunwald?

Id: [0x002B0505]
It's troubling, I know. Your folk are strong, hardy, noble! Creatures straight out of stories and tales.

Id: [0x002B0507]
O, yes, of this I am well aware. Blunt and stalwart, honest and true. I have a Dane ladylove with all those qualities, you know.

Id: [0x002B0509]
The people of Lincoln are not welcoming to Danes.

Id: [0x002B050A]

You are still young. You live to my age, and you will see. The closer you get, the greater the stink that rises.

Id: [0x002B0534]
I do. But I am not yet satisfied that you are the one for the task ahead.

Your Christ can wait his turn. It is you I've come to see.

You know these words, and you know why I speak them.

Id: [0x002B053A]
Speak the deeds of Christ in order. Only then will you will cometh unto my Lord.

Id: [0x002B053B]
That is not for me to decide, for I am not the one who summoned you. If you follow, I will lead you to him.

Id: [0x002B053F]
Are the riddles done?

Id: [0x002B0540]
Are the riddles done?

Id: [0x002B0542]
Still, his death has strengthened Christian fellowship in Wincestre. I pray the deaths of his colleagues will do the same.

How do you expect to find a king for this kingdom when this is the speed you work at?

Id: [0x002B0557]
How do you expect to find a king for this kingdom when this is the speed you work at?

And have you had enough fun yet?

Good. Come, come. Join me.

Id: [0x002B0563]
Take your time. It can wait.

Id: [0x002B0566]
I'm ready to hear you address your kingdom.

Id: [0x002B0567]
I'm ready to hear you address your kingdom.

I'm not yet finished celebrating. I'll come find you when I'm done.

I'm not yet finished celebrating. I'll come find you when I'm done.

Id: [0x002B056F]
Not long ago, men and women of some influence were murdered in those places, in oddly specific circumstances.

Id: [0x002B0570]
When I received this letter from our Poor Fellow-Soldier, it did not take long to work out why.

Id: [0x002B0571]
I don't know your motive, nor what you hope to gain. All I ask is that you finish the work you have begun, before these fallen souls infest England further.

Id: [0x002B0680]
Yes, my jarl. As in days of old.

Id: [0x002B068E]
He's been up there a while.

Id: [0x002B06C4]
My new ally is more loyal than my old friend.

Id: [0x002B06CB]
Eivor Two-Faced. That's your name.

Id: [0x002B06D6]
I came here for Halfdan. To prove my worth and loyalty to him. You brought this down upon yourself.

Id: [0x002B06D7]
I came here for Halfdan. To prove my worth and loyalty to him. You brought this down upon yourself.

Id: [0x002B06D8]
Gently, friend. I told Halfdan because it was my duty.

Id: [0x002B06D9]
Gently, friend. I told Halfdan because it was my duty.

Id: [0x002B072A]
If I had seen any more, I would have killed them too.

Id: [0x002B0743]
It'll be a good fight, I've faith in it.

Id: [0x002B074A]
Look there. The Picts send a message.

Id: [0x002B074D]
Where's Halfdan Jarl? Will he be here?

Id: [0x002B0758]
Raven-Tamer, with me. You'll talk them into a surrender with your sword-sharp tongue.

Id: [0x002B0762]
Meet us on the field near the fortress. We'll make our plans there.

Id: [0x002B0769]
Faravid's plan had better be sound.

Id: [0x002B076A]

Id: [0x002B0774]
Eivor, over here!

Id: [0x002B0793]
On the battlefield once more, old friend.

Id: [0x002B07A5]
Leave me be, you devil!

Id: [0x002B07AB]
You meet the spirits this day, traitor.

Id: [0x002B07AC]
You meet the spirits this day, traitor.

Id: [0x002B07AE]
Glory for Halfdan!

Id: [0x002B07B9]
Who are you to speak of the old days? The days where my word was bond. The days where the light of my glory lit the world.

Id: [0x002B07BE]
Who told you of this?

Id: [0x002B07BF]
My Saxon vassal is more loyal than any man in my army!

Id: [0x002B07C1]
Ricsige. That silk-tongued devil!

Id: [0x002B07C2]
Ricsige. That silk-tongued devil!

Id: [0x002B07C4]
Die you bastard dogs!

Id: [0x002B07CB]
Silk-tongued and loyal to the end, you backstabbing curs! Both of you! Traitorous schemers!

Id: [0x002B07D1]
Hold the wall!

Id: [0x002B07D2]
Hold the wall!

Id: [0x002B07D4]

Your death will come, Danes. Your end was writ the moment you came for me. I have made damned sure of that!

Id: [0x002B08A3]
The Zealots will know your names soon enough. No matter where you are, or how far you travel, they will hunt you down!

Id: [0x002B08A5]
Impressive. The Order of Ancients has surely been crippled by her loss.

Id: [0x002B08B3]
Gerhild, is it?

Damn Eadwyn. Blood for Oxenefordscire!

This letter, signed by one who calls himself a Poor Fellow-Soldier of Christ, warns of a plot against my life.

At his house, by the west gate. You may find something there.

Where was he last seen?

If I had one guess, to find these heretics from The Order of Ancients and bury them so deep, even God would need a shovel.

So where do we start digging?

End his terror, Eivor.

Aelfred's laws are a slave's fever-dream. He offers shit-soaked beggars a seat at his table. Where the meek devour the strong.

Y-you think you've … won? You haven't! Leofrith … I sent him away with orders to destroy you.

Id: [0x002B0980]
Right behind you.

Id: [0x002B0984]
Burgred, you old beauty! I hardly recognized you there.

Id: [0x002B098B]
Agh! Put me down!

Id: [0x002B098C]
Only way you go down is with a rope around your neck.

Id: [0x002B098D]
They'll be coming for him. Stay alert.

Id: [0x002B099C]
I must thank you before the ale dulls me. By cutting The Order down to size, you have given England a hope of unity.

Id: [0x002B09A0]
Well, if it keeps you busy…

Id: [0x002B09A1]

Lady Eadwyn's husband was the shire's ealdorman, until Guthrum's army ended his life.

Id: [0x002B0A69]
Curse you, Dane. My brother served God!

I've heard of him. The alewife also mentioned a Lady Eadwyn who commands the soldiers. Why not ally with her?

Take this key to the ruins beneath the bishop's house. You may find answers there.

Indeed. By His example, I live my life.

Come forth, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B0ABB]
Goodwin…

A traitor's death for a treasonous fool.

Id: [0x002B0BE0]
Hmph. There is something in that.

No more Saxon kings, Eivor. I am through playing the puppeteer. The fate of this shire rests on my shoulders alone.

Id: [0x002B0BE6]
I will. But I won't rule alone. My friends … and my allies … will keep me standing upright.

But I … I see no light. I feel no warmth. Only … an icy darkness, a cave.

I haven't seen Wigmund since we breached the wall. Regroup at the longhouse. We'll surely find him there.

Id: [0x002B0D3E]
Wigmund! You cannot hide from me forever! Come face your death!

Id: [0x002B0D40]
Any man who fights for Wigmund dies!

Id: [0x002B0D48]
Do take your time though, we may throw a picnic!

Id: [0x002B0D4B]
An excellent choice. And a lucky one too. For nothing in stock lingers very long. My selection changes daily.

Id: [0x002B0D4D]
Nothing for now, no matter! My selection changes daily. You will soon find something you like.

Id: [0x002B0D4F]
Now that you are friends with me, you are also a friend of the Thousand Eyes as well!

Id: [0x002B0D51]
Observe my outfit, note the scarf I wear. As you travel, you will meet many of my associates, clad in these same vestments.

Id: [0x002B0D52]
These are my people, my other Eyes. Seek them out for trade or contracts. Oblige them and you will earn a tidy sum.

And what does this mean?

Id: [0x002B0D54]
And what does this mean?

An interesting offer.

An interesting offer.

We set sail when you are ready.

Trouble ahead. Go, we'll cover you.

Help!

Eivor, stick his face in the horse's ass!

More of them.

Id: [0x002B0EEC]
To me, my soldiers! I'm here!

No … no … you, you Godless slugs. You won't get away with this.

Here we are. Look familiar?

Something troubling has come. A letter from Aelfgar in Lincoln. It seems the new ealdorman, Herefrith, has turned on them.

When you are able, you should visit with him. See what this is about.

Ah! Damn.

Enough of this sorcery, woman! Just point me towards the enemy, and I will handle them!

There! After them!

Id: [0x002B0F32]
Free the king! Whatever the cost!

Id: [0x002B0F3B]
Haul him up there. To the top. And keep him breathing.

Id: [0x002B0F41]
A crypt … now tell me this is not a sign from the gods.

I stand innocent!

Good. I hope he is a man we can trust.

Let us hope he proves a more reliable friend.

Zealots … who does he mean?

Id: [0x002B0F91]
A silver ring for your raven perch. It was Tryggr's before he gifted it to me.

Id: [0x002B0F93]
I say you've earned the right to wear it now.

Ricsige cannot defy orders he has never heard, no? Trust me, I will take the blame should our plan fall apart.

Ready your weapon! Or accept your fate as a feast for bears!

Id: [0x002B1107]
Ha! We'll fight to the death, worthy one.

Id: [0x002B1122]
Good men, all. They will have the proper rites, and their families will be cared for.

Id: [0x002B127F]
Well, if Halfdan's loyal mules have pledged to fight… Still, my help will come at a price.

Id: [0x002B1280]
I-if you're speaking of coin--

Id: [0x002B1282]
I remind you that your soldiers are mine.

Id: [0x002B1283]
Halfdan's, my good man. Halfdan's soldiers, for these are Halfdan's orders. Correct?

Id: [0x002B1285]
But I jest, I jest.

Id: [0x002B1288]
If Halfdan commands, I shall raise my fyrd. And you shall have your fighting army.

Id: [0x002B1291]
Eivor. A moment with you?

Id: [0x002B1293]
Faravid is Halfdan's man. So are the Hemmings of Snotinghamscire, as are we here in Jorvik. But not you.

Id: [0x002B1296]
For whom are you fighting, truly?

Id: [0x002B129A]
As any great leader must.

Id: [0x002B129D]
Fascinating. You boast loyalty yet keep secrets from your master.

Id: [0x002B12A9]
We all fight for Halfdan, and for Northumbria.

Id: [0x002B12AA]
We all fight for Halfdan, and for Northumbria.

Id: [0x002B12AC]
Loyal to the bone, aren't you?

Id: [0x002B12B1]
Quite the charmer, you are. But you jest. We all know in whom the true power lies.

Id: [0x002B12B9]
An innocuous question. Loyalty is a word that slides off the lips like honey.

Id: [0x002B12BA]
Sweet to the taste, but never lingering.

Id: [0x002B12BB]
There are things simmering in Northumbria, hidden from even you. Take heed and have a care.

Id: [0x002B12C9]
When you're ready, find me near Jorvik at a place called The Wolds.

Id: [0x002B12D8]
I'm sorry Faravid, but duty compels me to refuse. Without strict orders from Halfdan, I will not risk the lives of so many.

Id: [0x002B12E4]
And we'll have it, if we falsify orders from Halfdan ourselves.

Id: [0x002B12E5]
And we'll have it, if we falsify orders from Halfdan ourselves.

Id: [0x002B12E8]
Hm. Yes, yes.

Id: [0x002B12F7]
Enjoying the festivities?

Id: [0x002B12F8]
Enjoying the festivities?

Id: [0x002B131E]
Faravid.

Id: [0x002B131F]
Faravid.

Id: [0x002B13A8]
You! Guards will come at one cry from me.

Id: [0x002B13AB]
I am Estrid, wife of the Lord of Essexe. As you may have heard, my lord is not at home.

Id: [0x002B13AC]
Sheathe your blade, lady. I am Eivor of the Raven Clan, here at your husband's request.

Id: [0x002B13AD]
Sheathe your blade, lady. I am Eivor of the Raven Clan, here at your husband's request.

Id: [0x002B13B9]
Another Dane.

Id: [0x002B13C7]
My brother, Ivarr … did he die well?

Id: [0x002B13CD]
You slew my brother and never said a word. You kept this from me!

Id: [0x002B13D0]
Leave me!

Id: [0x002B13D4]
I was on my way to Scarborough. If you find my hammer, bring it to me there.

Id: [0x002B13D9]
Stand up, Halfdan. I'm taking you back to Jorvik.

Id: [0x002B13DA]
Stand up, Halfdan. I'm taking you back to Jorvik.

Id: [0x002B13DB]
Up, my lord. You're a king, you're not allowed to sulk.

Id: [0x002B13DC]
Up, my lord. You're a king, you're not allowed to sulk.

Id: [0x002B13DF]
He died fighting.

Id: [0x002B13E0]
He died fighting.

Id: [0x002B13E1]
It was no secret. Ubba knew, did he not--

Id: [0x002B13E2]
It was no secret. Ubba knew, did he not--

Id: [0x002B13E3]
I'll find your hammer. And then you'll come with me.

Id: [0x002B13E4]
I'll find your hammer. And then you'll come with me.

Id: [0x002B13E6]
I am weary of rounding up Saxons. Is your husband stolen, drunk, or wayward?

Id: [0x002B13E7]
I am weary of rounding up Saxons. Is your husband stolen, drunk, or wayward?

Id: [0x002B13E9]
If he's away, I'll speak to you.

Id: [0x002B13EA]
If he's away, I'll speak to you.

Id: [0x002B13EC]
You don't speak as one from here. Where is your home?

Id: [0x002B13ED]
You don't speak as one from here. Where is your home?

Id: [0x002B13F2]
Walk the bridge, old friend. I'll see you on the other side.

Id: [0x002B13F4]
Beonton may track his attackers. Get 'em, boy.

Id: [0x002B13F7]
I found your scout, but his wounds are grave.

Id: [0x002B13F8]
I found your scout, but his wounds are grave.

Id: [0x002B13FD]
He'll be stalking the woodlands today, hunting game and ignoring the vital affairs of Essexe.

Id: [0x002B13FF]
If I can find him, I'll remind him of his duties.

Id: [0x002B1400]
If I can find him, I'll remind him of his duties.

Id: [0x002B141B]
By the saints, I hope so. He led the beasts away, before they made a meal of me. I owe my life twofold today.

Id: [0x002B141C]
Eivor. I am looking for the ealdorman, Birstan. Does he live?

Id: [0x002B141D]
Eivor. I am looking for the ealdorman, Birstan. Does he live?

Id: [0x002B1426]
I'll find him if I can. Return to the safety of guarded walls and warm hearths.

Id: [0x002B1427]
I'll find him if I can. Return to the safety of guarded walls and warm hearths.

Id: [0x002B142B]
I am ready … ready to meet my God.

Id: [0x002B142C]
Your end is coming, Saxon. Be brave, and the pain will soon pass.

Id: [0x002B142D]
Your end is coming, Saxon. Be brave, and the pain will soon pass.

Id: [0x002B142F]
So we are to blunder in like an ox?

Id: [0x002B143A]
I am glad you answered my summons. I did not expect such a skilled fighter!

Id: [0x002B1440]
It's good I came when I did. You lost many men on this hunt.

Id: [0x002B1441]
It's good I came when I did. You lost many men on this hunt.

Id: [0x002B1449]
You have done the impossible, Dane. Returned my errant gander to his coop.

Id: [0x002B144F]
My pettish love, such a stormy countenance clouds the sun of my return.

Id: [0x002B145A]
Your thegns drank the ale the abbot gifted us. All of it.

Id: [0x002B145B]
Now that is a tragedy my heart will not easily overcome.

Id: [0x002B1476]
No, no. I would not inflict the infighting of my thegns upon you, Eivor. Our matters are more delicate.

Id: [0x002B1477]
Essexe seems at odds with itself. Have you called me here to fix the many problems I have already seen today?

Id: [0x002B1478]
Essexe seems at odds with itself. Have you called me here to fix the many problems I have already seen today?

Id: [0x002B147A]
I notice your love has gone sour. Was it fresher than this?

Id: [0x002B147B]
I notice your love has gone sour. Was it fresher than this?

Id: [0x002B1492]
Our affairs are more of heart than of state, Eivor. What little passion there was between us faded into bickering long ago.

Id: [0x002B1493]
So what do you need of me?

Id: [0x002B1494]
So what do you need of me?

Id: [0x002B1495]
We would have our freedom, Eivor. I from my wife, and my wife from Essexe.

Id: [0x002B1497]
I am too sharp a weapon for so soft a task. Why not part and be done with it?

Id: [0x002B1498]
I am too sharp a weapon for so soft a task. Why not part and be done with it?

Id: [0x002B14EA]
Our God, our king. There is much standing in the way of a joyous uncoupling. Ours was an arranged marriage, a political need, and not easily broken.

Id: [0x002B14EB]
Does your god not allow husbands and wives to part?

Id: [0x002B14EC]
Does your god not allow husbands and wives to part?

Id: [0x002B14ED]
O, were I a Dane! And divorce as simple as a slit throat. But it's not so easy as that.

Id: [0x002B14F3]
Then what is stopping you? Your King Aelfred?

Id: [0x002B14F4]
Then what is stopping you? Your King Aelfred?

Id: [0x002B14FD]
Ours was not a union of love, but necessity. Decreed by Aelfred's father to strengthen ties with Francia. Not easily broken.

Id: [0x002B1506]
We had a plan, a simple plan. A woman lost and a woman found.

Id: [0x002B1507]
Some time ago, we paid a Dane to kidnap me and ferry me safely to Francia. As you can see, he did not deliver.

Id: [0x002B150A]
Some Norse can be quick to take coin and slow to earn it. If I give my word, it is not broken.

Id: [0x002B150B]
Some Norse can be quick to take coin and slow to earn it. If I give my word, it is not broken.

Id: [0x002B150D]
Could we try the kidnap again? Much of the planning is done. It would only take a more trustworthy overseer.

Id: [0x002B150F]
It should be a bold venture if we do. Loud and brash and seen by all.

Id: [0x002B1510]
It should be a bold venture if we do. Loud and brash and seen by all.

Id: [0x002B1512]
We could ask him.

Id: [0x002B1515]
A darling May-bud. Alfida, my childhood sweetheart. I left her twenty years ago in Maeldun to marry my prickled pear.

Id: [0x002B1516]
And the woman found?

Id: [0x002B1517]
And the woman found?

Id: [0x002B1519]
I will do as you both ask, and ask Freyja for success in this love game.

Id: [0x002B151A]
I will do as you both ask, and ask Freyja for success in this love game.

Id: [0x002B151C]
Come find me in the market, Eivor. Our unwelcome guests require food and ale to soften their anger.

Id: [0x002B151E]
[laugh]There is so little difference between love and hate, it's difficult to say where the sourness comes from.

Id: [0x002B1521]
It does!

Id: [0x002B1535]
This vermin was crawling to the river, hoping to float away!

Id: [0x002B1595]
Here is one!

Id: [0x002B1599]
[pain]Have mercy, friend, and you may find an ally with us.

Id: [0x002B159F]
Mercy is earned by the quickness of your tongue. Where do you come from and what is your quarrel with us?

Id: [0x002B15A0]
Mercy is earned by the quickness of your tongue. Where do you come from and what is your quarrel with us?

Id: [0x002B15A1]
We are settled in East Anglia. Newly arrived and hungry for silver.

Id: [0x002B15A6]
My dad were a warrior. All he did was complain about how he once took an arrow to the knee.

Id: [0x002B15A7]
Great, perhaps. I have fought many battles.

Id: [0x002B15A8]
Great, perhaps. I have fought many battles.

Id: [0x002B15AA]
As we were ordered.

Id: [0x002B15AC]
[pain]You bore me.

Id: [0x002B15AF]
Useless hound, scratching your ass in search of silver. Put an end to this one.

Id: [0x002B15B0]
You drifted off course. This is Mercia.

Id: [0x002B15B1]
You drifted off course. This is Mercia.

Id: [0x002B15B2]
By whom?

Id: [0x002B15B3]
By whom?

Id: [0x002B15B7]
Or rather, you buried another in his place. The poor gravedigger's friend, burning his face so no one would know.

Id: [0x002B15B8]
Or rather, you buried another in his place. The poor gravedigger's friend, burning his face so no one would know.

Id: [0x002B15BA]
The wind sent us. And the rivers will take us home.

Id: [0x002B15BB]
He begs for death, Eivor! Give it to him.

Id: [0x002B15BC]
Or send him home with a warning. Let him tell his people what death awaits them, should they sail this way again.

Id: [0x002B15C3]
[exhale]I thank you--

Id: [0x002B15C5]
Go. And do not return.

Id: [0x002B15C6]
Go. And do not return.

Id: [0x002B15C7]
This is not mercy, it is death deferred. Whoever sent you, warn them of the slaughter that awaits should any return.

Id: [0x002B15C8]
This is not mercy, it is death deferred. Whoever sent you, warn them of the slaughter that awaits should any return.

Id: [0x002B15C9]
(grunt)

Id: [0x002B15CC]
O, what tales I will tell.

Id: [0x002B15D1]
To show mercy would endanger us! Soil our reputation as cowards! This was the only end possible!

Id: [0x002B15D6]
Sigurd would have acted as I did. That is all the justification I need.

Id: [0x002B15DA]
I see you, Eivor. And I know what you are.

Id: [0x002B15DC]
Put no stock in what Dag says. His bluster may be loud, but it blows softly.

Id: [0x002B15E0]
Send one of your scouts to follow him. We will find--

Id: [0x002B15E1]
Send one of your scouts to follow him. We will find--

Id: [0x002B15E2]
Dag!

Id: [0x002B15E3]
Dag!

Id: [0x002B15E4]
We could have learned something by tracking him. Now we know nothing.

Id: [0x002B15E5]
We could have learned something by tracking him. Now we know nothing.

Id: [0x002B15E8]
Get this cleaned up. Then we will talk of next steps.

Id: [0x002B15E9]
Get this cleaned up. Then we will talk of next steps.

Id: [0x002B15EA]
Not priest, clerk, or abbot can turn the letter of their sermons from Latin to English. And how can we understand God's words if they are not spoken in our tongue?

Id: [0x002B15EB]
Ealhferth is dead. And we mourn him. But the foul deeds of the unrighteous are sown among our holy deeds like cockles and tare in a field of wheat.

Id: [0x002B15EC]
Education, wisdom, enlightened thought, this will raise us above the sins of our fathers. These I will demand of the next bishop of Wincestre.

Id: [0x002B15ED]
And so we meet to discuss all worthy candidates. And choose the man who will shepherd our flock.

Id: [0x002B15F2]
Eivor, I could have sent my scouts to follow him home. We might have learned something.

Id: [0x002B15F4]
Just as Sigurd would have done.

Id: [0x002B15F5]
I cannot devise a strategy if my advice is ignored.

Id: [0x002B15F7]
To let that man live would announce to the world that we are soft and cowardly. Now these wayward Danes know to fear us.

Id: [0x002B15FA]
For once, you see clearly. I beg the gods that it continues.

Id: [0x002B15FC]
We should clean this mess, and move the bodies from the camp.

Id: [0x002B15FF]
May there be one who mourns you at home, for we will not.

Id: [0x002B1600]
May there be one who mourns you at home, for we will not.

Id: [0x002B1601]
The price of such disrespect is death, Randvi.

Id: [0x002B1602]
The price of such disrespect is death, Randvi.

Id: [0x002B1603]
Forgive my haste, Randvi. But Dag is right.

Id: [0x002B1604]
Forgive my haste, Randvi. But Dag is right.

Id: [0x002B1611]
Then promise me a reward I can sing about. A healthy king's weight in silver.

Id: [0x002B1612]
Then promise me a reward I can sing about. A healthy king's weight in silver.

Id: [0x002B1617]
You may remove the organs of state, the cancer will remain.

Id: [0x002B1618]
I should let The Order kill you. It would speed our conquest of England.

Id: [0x002B1619]
I should let The Order kill you. It would speed our conquest of England.

Id: [0x002B1625]
Be thou hale, Ealdorbana! That's life-destroyer in our dialect.

Id: [0x002B1627]
You're quite safe with me, Dane. For now.

Id: [0x002B1629]
I sat easy with my kins-bane, old honey-waves alive in my horn, and my eyes on the door, expecting my death, yet unafraid.

Id: [0x002B162A]
I sat easy with my kins-bane, old honey-waves alive in my horn, and my eyes on the door, expecting my death, yet unafraid.

Id: [0x002B162E]
Weep for Northumbria.

Id: [0x002B1636]
His heart is broken. He is a mere shadow of himself.

Id: [0x002B163C]
With Faravid lost and his brothers away, he wallows in paranoia and sadness.

Id: [0x002B1641]
Wandering the fields of Picheringa with his beloved Beonton.

Id: [0x002B1652]
My father, Ragnar, he gifted this to me. Took it off a Finnish chief.

Id: [0x002B1657]
A Finnish arrow killed my mother.

Id: [0x002B1659]
A shield-maiden she was, as fierce as a wolf swallowing the sun.

Id: [0x002B165B]
My father swore to kill the men who took her from us. And he did, fourteen against one.

Id: [0x002B165F]
But that was years ago, in the east. And this is the west, where my father lies dead, a pile of bones in a pit of snakes.

Id: [0x002B1664]
How did my brother die?

Id: [0x002B1669]
This hammer is not meant to be thrown, Halfdan. Remember that next time.

Id: [0x002B166A]
This hammer is not meant to be thrown, Halfdan. Remember that next time.

Ragnar Lothbrok was a great king.

Id: [0x002B166C]
Ragnar Lothbrok was a great king.

Id: [0x002B166D]
And here we are, still telling stories of his life and deeds.

Id: [0x002B166E]
And here we are, still telling stories of his life and deeds.

Id: [0x002B1678]
Hm. Now he drinks at our father's side, awaiting the war at the end of days.

Id: [0x002B167A]
With his hand on his axe, awaiting the maidens of the battle-slain.

Id: [0x002B167B]
With his hand on his axe, awaiting the maidens of the battle-slain.

Id: [0x002B1682]
Hm. If the codes of honor demanded his death, you did what had to be done.

Id: [0x002B1686]
Beonton, my boy! Come here boy!

Id: [0x002B1689]
Hmph.

Id: [0x002B168B]
Do a last thing for me. Light the beacon for all to see. And let it burn.

Id: [0x002B169B]
Ivarr murdered an innocent man, a good man. He earned the death I gave him.

Id: [0x002B169C]

A dog always forgives. But he needs you home. All of Northumbria does.

He's clinging to life. I should carry him down.

Id: [0x002B16DA]
He's clinging to life. I should carry him down.

Id: [0x002B16DE]
I was caught off guard, but I shouldn't have been. A fog set in, and I couldn't see the forest before me.

Id: [0x002B16F4]
You mean more to your king than you know. Take this goblet.

Id: [0x002B16F5]
You mean more to your king than you know. Take this goblet.

Hunting is a fine sport, but I hope the ealdorman has not become the prey.

Id: [0x002B16F8]
Hunting is a fine sport, but I hope the ealdorman has not become the prey.

Id: [0x002B170F]
Will this pain not cease?

Id: [0x002B1710]
A sad fate. I am sorry, Gisele, my love.

Id: [0x002B1711]
The air is darkening around me.

Id: [0x002B1714]
Look there! The pipes cut through that wall. Could there be more rooms beyond?

Id: [0x002B1715]
Look there! The pipes cut through that wall. Could there be more rooms beyond?

Id: [0x002B1716]
The words of a poet. Now let us drown ourselves in mead. For friendship.

Id: [0x002B171B]
That should help this poor sod.

Id: [0x002B171C]
That should help this poor sod.

Id: [0x002B1720]
I have a new brother, much like Halfdan. Not by blood, but through the battles we've fought, hand in hand.

Id: [0x002B1721]
I have a new brother, much like Halfdan. Not by blood, but through the battles we've fought, hand in hand.

Through him I have learned that battle bonds run deeper than blades can cut. I will never forget that lesson.

Id: [0x002B1723]
Through him I have learned that battle bonds run deeper than blades can cut. I will never forget that lesson.

Id: [0x002B1726]
No, you keep it. Gifting him a goblet from the spoils of battle was a ritual between Halfdan and I. This one should be yours.

Id: [0x002B172F]
A healthy-seeming town. This Oswald has done well for himself.

Id: [0x002B1730]

Have you had enough fun? My crowning must come soon.

Beamasfield is just ahead. Lead, I will follow.

Id: [0x002B1761]
Danes? No, no! Protect me.

Id: [0x002B1764]
I'll save some for later. Let's make a king of you.

Id: [0x002B1765]
I'll save some for later. Let's make a king of you.

Id: [0x002B1767]
Guards! Murder! Aid me!

Id: [0x002B1769]
Of course, of course. Return when you've had your fill.

Id: [0x002B176A]
It's early, Halfdan. We have more barrels to drain and merriment to make.

Id: [0x002B176B]
It's early, Halfdan. We have more barrels to drain and merriment to make.

Id: [0x002B179A]
Look there, a lone Dane. Can't trust that.

Id: [0x002B179C]
Shh. Be kind, yeah? As Christ would command.

Id: [0x002B17A6]
Moira. What is this metal? It's soft, like Roman pipes.

Id: [0x002B17A7]
Moira. What is this metal? It's soft, like Roman pipes.

Id: [0x002B17A8]
Wolf-Kissed, yes. Happy to be here.

Id: [0x002B17A9]
The crowning of a new king, it's not something I've seen this close!

Id: [0x002B17EE]
She called us flaccid!

Id: [0x002B17F1]
Limp, weak, soft …

Id: [0x002B17F2]
Limp, weak, soft …

Id: [0x002B17F5]
Not much more than a boy in his seventeenth year. Full of youthful bravado.

Id: [0x002B17F7]
A Dane. Though Eadred calls you raiders. He says that you are here to steal England.

Id: [0x002B17FE]
That was expensive! Watch out!

Id: [0x002B181A]
The Raven-Feeder returns!

Id: [0x002B181C]
Now keep quiet. I'm hunting a band of traitors lurking about this swamp.

Id: [0x002B181F]
Halfdan, good to find you here.

Id: [0x002B1820]
Halfdan, good to find you here.

Id: [0x002B1827]
You have savaged enough men today, beast!

Id: [0x002B1828]
This is one Saxon you won't kill today!

Id: [0x002B1855]
Thank you, Eivor. A thousand times, I thank you.

Id: [0x002B1859]
O, quite a diverse mixture, let me see … lavender, rosemary, meadowsweet, yarrow. Soothing herbs, nothing uncommon.

Id: [0x002B185B]
I fear so. The same malady bedeviled my mother. The body breaks down and the mind falls apart over time. It's a terrible thing.

Id: [0x002B185F]
My medicine is meant to alleviate his pain, not cure it. I fear there is no cure at all for what ails Halfdan.

Id: [0x002B1862]
I need your help, Moira. The brews you mix for Halfdan. What goes into them?

Id: [0x002B1863]
I need your help, Moira. The brews you mix for Halfdan. What goes into them?

Id: [0x002B1866]
When you said there's no cure for what ails Halfdan … you mean he's touched in the head?

Id: [0x002B1867]
When you said there's no cure for what ails Halfdan … you mean he's touched in the head?

Id: [0x002B1878]
Can you cure his illness with such a brew?

Id: [0x002B1879]
Can you cure his illness with such a brew?

Id: [0x002B1881]
Stand back, Dane. There's a witch within that house. We've come to burn it down.

Id: [0x002B1883]
That proves it! Dark magic, that is!

Id: [0x002B1886]
What's this ruckus?

Id: [0x002B1887]
What's this ruckus?

Id: [0x002B1888]
She's no witch, she's Halfdan's healer.

Id: [0x002B1889]
She's no witch, she's Halfdan's healer.

Id: [0x002B188A]
Clear out, all of you! Before I beat you senseless.

Id: [0x002B188B]
Clear out, all of you! Before I beat you senseless.

Id: [0x002B1895]
O Lord above have mercy. Yes, fine, I'll do it. Whatever it takes.

Id: [0x002B1899]
I'm as good with words as I am with weapons. It will take some convincing, but I can talk my way out of this.

Id: [0x002B189A]

You give a good scream and fall. Then I'll carry you through the mob as if I've done you serious harm.

Id: [0x002B189E]
You give a good scream and fall. Then I'll carry you through the mob as if I've done you serious harm.

Id: [0x002B18A3]
Away from my house, you ruffians!

Id: [0x002B18AC]
C'mon outta there, you heathen lover!

Id: [0x002B18B2]
You can't hide forever!

Id: [0x002B18CC]
Shhh! Listen…

Id: [0x002B18CD]
Shhh! Listen…

Id: [0x002B18E5]
And you buried him when Goodwin got too close to the truth.

Id: [0x002B18E6]
And you buried him when Goodwin got too close to the truth.

Id: [0x002B18F1]
Better than thinking on Lord Birstan plowing my mother in a bed large enough to be a boat. Or is she my sister? Jesus…

Id: [0x002B18F2]
Does the ale ease your heart's ache, Eluric? Or does it only deepen your sorrow?

Id: [0x002B18F3]
Does the ale ease your heart's ache, Eluric? Or does it only deepen your sorrow?

Id: [0x002B18F6]
I don't know. I'm just … I'm so angry at them. I don't even know why.

Id: [0x002B18F8]
Birstan didn't know you were his son, and Alfida would have been shamed had it been known you were a bastard child.

Id: [0x002B18F9]
Birstan didn't know you were his son, and Alfida would have been shamed had it been known you were a bastard child.

May Fenrir gnaw your bones!

Id: [0x002B1906]
My sword will bring you sleep!

Id: [0x002B1908]
But he got away and headed east for Bolingbroc castle. That's my best lead.

Id: [0x002B1909]
But he got away and headed east for Bolingbroc castle. That's my best lead.

Id: [0x002B190A]
My mother would cradle me beneath the stars and whisper dovelike, "God watches over you."

Id: [0x002B190B]
God watched all … and I hated him.

Id: [0x002B190E]
You cannot slander and keep your tongue. You cannot walk freely through our streets, mocking our laws, our king's edicts.

Id: [0x002B190F]
And so I ask, who has the right to determine the fate of the perverse, if not the goodly people of Wincestre? I am but your humble servant.

Id: [0x002B1910]
And when we've caught him, we mean to crown another. Our dear Thegn Ceolwulf here.

Id: [0x002B1914]
A reward in silver for each dead Dane!

Id: [0x002B191E]
See how proudly she sits. How beautiful she gleams. Here, all the roots of life run together.

Id: [0x002B1920]
The skalds would cry to behold such a sight.

Id: [0x002B1921]
The skalds would cry to behold such a sight.

Id: [0x002B1926]
Saxon bastards! Rollo the Imprudent? I'll show them! I'll be Rollo the Gelder soon enough!

Id: [0x002B1929]
Was it you who gave Ivarr the Boneless his name? I hear talk of his deeds around the campfire, but the name I never understood.

Id: [0x002B192F]
He was Boneless before I met him. Now he's bones on a pyre, that's all I know for sure.

Id: [0x002B1930]
He was Boneless before I met him. Now he's bones on a pyre, that's all I know for sure.

Id: [0x002B1935]
And King Aelfred? Can you imagine their king in the sky-blanket Tyr sends our lands?

Id: [0x002B1936]
He'd be bluer than my father on nights the mead is strong. He'd fall asleep in the snow with a dog keeping him warm.

Id: [0x002B193E]
Or Rollo the Screamer if you don't keep it down.

Id: [0x002B193F]
Or Rollo the Screamer if you don't keep it down.

Id: [0x002B1940]
Eivor, you've come!

Id: [0x002B1944]
You raised no one. You only trapped them in their cowering fear.

Id: [0x002B1945]
You raised no one. You only trapped them in their cowering fear.

Hunwald. Ealdorman of Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x002B194E]
Hunwald. Ealdorman of Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x002B1953]
Grief is a constant companion these days. First the loss of my father, then Lincolnscire. What more have I to lose?

Id: [0x002B1959]
I'm Norse, actually. Something you might learn by asking.

Id: [0x002B195A]
I'm Norse, actually. Something you might learn by asking.

Id: [0x002B1961]
O, goodness, I've been discovered.

Id: [0x002B1962]
Don't be frightened, Grim. But I believe Aelfgar has arranged for us to meet.

Id: [0x002B1963]
Don't be frightened, Grim. But I believe Aelfgar has arranged for us to meet.

Id: [0x002B1965]
It is good to meet you, Grim.

Id: [0x002B1966]
It is good to meet you, Grim.

Id: [0x002B1967]
Of course, Randvi, of course. Hytham will tell you all you need to know.

Id: [0x002B196C]
It does have a lordly ring, does it not? Like the name itself was a holy notch waiting for the right peg to fill the space.

Id: [0x002B196F]
And how do you find your responsibilities?

Id: [0x002B1970]
And how do you find your responsibilities?

Id: [0x002B197C]
We've come for your crown, lord.

Id: [0x002B197D]
I admire your ambition, pagan. But what you ask is impossible. No Dane ever has or ever will occupy Mercia's sacred throne.

Id: [0x002B198B]
They are not changing in a way I would like or would expect, but it is changing.

Id: [0x002B198C]
As is the way of it when new leadership takes hold. But if I were to tell you I had no worries, I would be lying to you.

Id: [0x002B1991]
Norse. Dane. Dog. You're all the same to me, all godless.

Id: [0x002B1994]
Would you settle for a Norse? We're not as gentle but we're much better poets.

Id: [0x002B1995]
Would you settle for a Norse? We're not as gentle but we're much better poets.

Id: [0x002B1996]
I grow weary of this palaver! You have trampled our lands, toppled our monuments. We've given you silver. Fed your people.

Id: [0x002B19A2]
Ceolwulf, you mean?[laugh] When I've done with you lot, I'll execute that foolish thegn for treason!

Id: [0x002B19A3]
Not to worry. We have a Mercian of our own.

Id: [0x002B19A4]
Not to worry. We have a Mercian of our own.

Id: [0x002B19A5]
I will. Rest assured.

Id: [0x002B19A6]
My king, may I suggest a more measured approach to this--

Id: [0x002B19A8]
No more! We will die defending what is ours, whatsoever the cost.

Id: [0x002B19AD]
Are you well?

Id: [0x002B19AE]
Are you well?

Id: [0x002B19B4]
I have another title, Eivor, I think you know better than most.

Id: [0x002B19B6]
Agreed!

Id: [0x002B19B8]
Much the same. My duties are more manifold, as are the people in my care. But the feeling is remarkably similar.

Id: [0x002B19B9]
I think I shall be quite comfortable in my role here, Eivor. Thanks to your impeccable judgement.

Id: [0x002B19BA]
Lord Aelfgar. How does it feel to be ealdorman?

Id: [0x002B19BB]
Lord Aelfgar. How does it feel to be ealdorman?

Id: [0x002B19BD]
Eivor. I must say, I expected a rather different outcome. But … no matter. You cannot un-throw a stone from a creek.

Id: [0x002B19BE]
Aelfgar.

Id: [0x002B19BF]
Aelfgar.

Id: [0x002B19C0]
These Saxons don't hold a candle to our Danish hospitality.

Id: [0x002B19C7]
If you want my crown, Ubba Ragnarsson, you must pry it from the hands of my bloodless corpse! Man the walls!

Id: [0x002B19CB]
Hello, Eivor. Lincolnscire has been … changing certainly.

Id: [0x002B19CC]
Lord Aelfgar. How has Lincolnscire been since the vote?

Id: [0x002B19CD]
Lord Aelfgar. How has Lincolnscire been since the vote?

Id: [0x002B19D1]
But he has not cured you of your heathenism, I see. These things are sent to try us, I suppose.

Id: [0x002B19D3]
Eivor. Things certainly are interesting with Hunwald as ealdorman. He's making most of his father's mistakes, but with a passion and honesty I quite admire.

Id: [0x002B19D5]
Lord Aelfgar.

Id: [0x002B19D6]
Lord Aelfgar.

Id: [0x002B19D7]
Hardly surprising. I hope you'll be there for him if he needs help.

Id: [0x002B19D8]
Hardly surprising. I hope you'll be there for him if he needs help.

Id: [0x002B19DA]
I can't presume to know what the Lord has in store for us all. But, barring insurmountable odds, of course I am your ally, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B19DB]
Bishop Herefrith.

Id: [0x002B19DC]
Bishop Herefrith.

Id: [0x002B19DD]
So you elected a man-child to lead us. To be a vacuum of leadership where a solid pillar is needed. God preserve us all.

Id: [0x002B19E2]
Rest assured, I carry both with ease. The Lord saw fit to grant me the strength and clarity I need to rule this shire.

Id: [0x002B19E3]
You turned out to be an excellent tool of the Lord's will. You don't understand what an honor that is, but perhaps in time you will.

Id: [0x002B19E4]
Bishop and ealdorman. Those are two high titles for one man to hold, Herefrith.

Id: [0x002B19E5]
Bishop and ealdorman. Those are two high titles for one man to hold, Herefrith.

Id: [0x002B19E6]
I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours, Dane.

Id: [0x002B19E9]
Can I count on you as an ally in the future?

Id: [0x002B19EA]
Can I count on you as an ally in the future?

Id: [0x002B19EC]
There there, Hunwald, take deep breaths. Perhaps I can find you a jar to take the edge off.

Id: [0x002B19EE]
Eivor! Good to see you.

Id: [0x002B19F0]
There have been some … choppy waters so far. I'm being welcomed as much as can be expected of these Saxons.

Id: [0x002B19F2]
I've had my own words so far. Concise ones. But thank you for the offer.

Id: [0x002B19F3]
Hail, Swanburrow.

Id: [0x002B19F4]
Hail, Swanburrow.

Id: [0x002B19F5]
How are things in Lincolnscire?

Id: [0x002B19F6]
How are things in Lincolnscire?

Id: [0x002B19F7]
You don't say? You need me to have a word with anyone?

Id: [0x002B19F8]
You don't say? You need me to have a word with anyone?

Id: [0x002B19FA]
I applaud your judgement, and thank the Lord He saw fit to clear the clouds of doubt from your mind.

Id: [0x002B19FC]
Abbess.

Id: [0x002B19FD]
Abbess.

Id: [0x002B19FE]
You could just give me the credit for how I cast my vote. I didn't see your god pick up a voting stone.

Id: [0x002B19FF]
You could just give me the credit for how I cast my vote. I did not see your god pick up a voting stone.

Id: [0x002B1A00]
Aelfgar cares as much for his people as a goat cares for politics. Rest easy, knowing you have broken no wheel.

Id: [0x002B1A0E]
And join Cernunnos … in a bed of leaves. Tuck me in, stranger. With a song.

Id: [0x002B1A10]
Grim.

Id: [0x002B1A11]
Grim.

Id: [0x002B1A12]
O? I'm sure there are many tales you can tell from all the roads you've walked.

Id: [0x002B1A14]
Immortality not through your gods' tongues, but through the tongues of man.

Id: [0x002B1A16]
I hope so. Whatever happens, I want the name Eivor to be known to many.

Id: [0x002B1A17]
I hope so. Whatever happens, I want the name Eivor to be known to many.

Id: [0x002B1A18]
Both, I hope. We will see where my life leads.

Id: [0x002B1A19]
Both, I hope. We will see where my life leads.

Id: [0x002B1A1A]
I do not envy you the position you were in with Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x002B1A1B]
I lead Grimsby simply enough, but to choose the fate and bruise the ego of not one but three men?

Id: [0x002B1A1C]
It's not how we Danes should be spending our precious days.

Id: [0x002B1A1E]
Better than most, my friend. I wish you good fortune in the times ahead.

Id: [0x002B1A1F]
I'm not above unpleasant work. I do what's needed for my settlement and its people.

Id: [0x002B1A20]
I'm not above unpleasant work. I do what's needed for my settlement and its people.

Id: [0x002B1A29]
The men who'd see you burn are dead. Let's get these fires out.

Id: [0x002B1A2B]
What news?

Id: [0x002B1A2C]
What news?

Id: [0x002B1A2E]
What news, Hunwald?

Id: [0x002B1A2F]
What news, Hunwald?

Id: [0x002B1A43]
Rats have a certain freedom, but they feed on shit. It is a coward's freedom. A Valholl for the vanquished.

Id: [0x002B1A4B]
The Old Gods will fade from our sight, in time. God forgive me, for I have sinned.

Id: [0x002B1A65]
Who died and made you sovereign of Northumbria now?

Id: [0x002B1A67]
Jesus. Ease up now. We was only protecting our hamlet here. Tell Halfdan he can have 'er.

Id: [0x002B1A6B]
Up your arse, Odin-fucker!

Id: [0x002B1A6F]
Go home, all of you. This woman is in my care now.

Id: [0x002B1A70]
Go home, all of you. This woman is in my care now.

No sense wasting a fine goblet.

No sense wasting a fine goblet.

Id: [0x002B1A84]
I'll bother who I please, after I brick your face to the brains.

Id: [0x002B1A8A]
With greater sense, I hope. What brings you back to Jorvik?

Id: [0x002B1A8B]
Eivor, always the fighter.

Id: [0x002B1A90]
Secret errands for Halfdan. I need an army of men to face the Picts in the North.

Secret errands for Halfdan. I need an army of men to face the Picts in the North.

Id: [0x002B1A94]
Has Halfdan planned an attack he cannot afford? That's not like him.

Id: [0x002B1A96]
Does Halfdan know of this plan or…

Id: [0x002B1A97]
To be clear, Faravid made this plan. Not Halfdan.

Ale costs more than bread! Things were better under Audun.

Id: [0x002B1AA0]
Hjorr, this crowd won't listen to reason.

Id: [0x002B1AA1]
We shall speak again when you return my errant husband.

Id: [0x002B1AA8]
I hurt them more by returning! They have their love. They don't want me around.

Id: [0x002B1AAB]
Your mother loves you, and your father wants to. You hurt yourself by hiding.

Id: [0x002B1AAC]
Your mother loves you, and your father wants to. You hurt yourself by hiding.

Id: [0x002B1AAE]
Do I need a reason?

Your rage is just. Your mother should not have deceived you. But is that any cause to sulk and drink yourself stupid?

Your rage is just. Your mother should not have deceived you. But is that any cause to sulk and drink yourself stupid?

O, God in heaven, yes. The Romans knew this well. And my poor mother, she … she drank from cups like these for so long, she--

Id: [0x002B1ACD]
And was it lead that drove the Romans mad? Can metal do this to a man?

Id: [0x002B1ACE]
And was it lead that drove the Romans mad? Can metal do this to a man?

Never doubt me, Raven-Feeder. These Saxon king-slaves did.

Id: [0x002B1B0D]
Good advice. Such is my fiercest desire.

Id: [0x002B1B0F]
O! Tell me!

Another kidnap scheme! Estrid is unshakable. All right, then. Let we two triumph where one failed.

Id: [0x002B1B1F]
You shame me, and rightly so. Love cuts deeper than an axe, but I'll dwell on the pain no longer. My people need me.

Id: [0x002B1B23]
As do I. You owe me a debt. I call on it now.

But ho! Are you the Norse I sent word to?

Id: [0x002B1B5A]
As family, we are as close as Cain and Abel. She is a willful woman, and I am a bad husband. You know me, it seems?

Id: [0x002B1B60]
'Sblood, yes! Let us return to Colcestre at once and we'll speak more of the delicate matter on my mind.

Id: [0x002B1B65]
You have my gratitude. To stumble upon me in my moment of greatest peril, perhaps you were God-sent?

Id: [0x002B1B67]
When do they not? You could return and report that the savage claw took me. "Poor Birstan, his exit, pursued by a bear!"

Id: [0x002B1B69]
No doubt my Estrid would prefer his velvet paws to my calloused hands. So, who are you? A sellsword?

I'm Estrid-sent. Your wife and the thegns of Essexe both want your balls on a blacksmith's anvil.

The cathedral. And whatever waits within.

Follow my lead, brother.

Follow my lead, brother.

Id: [0x002B1C32]
I … I can't believe I survived that!

Id: [0x002B1C33]
I mean this with the utmost love, my friend: neither can I.

Id: [0x002B1C34]
The blood and splinters, flying through the air! The blood … and viscera … [gag]absolutely [gag]poetic…!

Id: [0x002B1C39]
Norway, ah! It must be beautiful. Rugged and fearsome. And cold as anything, the frozen North.

Id: [0x002B1D3C]
Now, my dear brethren. Eadred, perhaps you will start us off. What troubles you?

Id: [0x002B1D3D]
You're a disgrace, Birstan! Couldn't get a sow pissed in an alehouse. Aelfred's men are crawling all over Essexe!

Id: [0x002B1D3E]
King Aelfred, yes … though it is within his right, the constant presence of his men is certainly an issue.

Id: [0x002B1D40]
Ah … we should challenge his right to rule? Was not Essexe once a thriving kingdom of its own? We should fight! Yes, fight!

Id: [0x002B1D42]
Are they men or babes? If Aelfred meddles in the affairs of Essexe, send his men home in shrouds.

Aelfred's forces are only here because of Estrid's failed kidnap. Now that she is safe, they will soon be gone.

Id: [0x002B1D53]
Aelfred will get bored soon enough. He has bigger pikes to bake than are to be found in this stolid backwater.

The feast, yes. The festival! This is not for full bellies, but to bless the loaf. Does that not bring us all good fortune?

Often should one make an early meal, nor fasting come to the feast.

Yes, you worry about the cost of such a festival, one that thanks God for our great harvest? Contribute your own coin, then.

Refuse our king? Has madness taken your wits, Birstan?

Id: [0x002B1D97]
And Aldrich? Do you yap like a she-hound as Eadred does?

Id: [0x002B1D98]
You know my thoughts, Birstan. The fyrd. How can we give men to Aelfred for his wars when our harvest suffers day by day?

Id: [0x002B1D9B]
Norse by the music of your speech.

Id: [0x002B1D9E]
And who are you to Estrid?

Id: [0x002B1DA2]
The Danes are a great threat when provoked. Those we cannot ally with, we must fight or lose our lands.

Id: [0x002B1DA3]
Do they not defend your land? You'll need all the men you can muster to fight the coming wars.

Only a friend. I'm Eivor, of the Raven Clan.

Yet still you haunt my hall? Begone, I haven't time for your squabbling!

I know just the one! And her captain is full of fire. Come, I will take you to him.

Id: [0x002B1E09]
Yes! It's a wonderful evening, a blessing of the harvest. Full of fruits and fires, drinking and dancing.

And what of our plan, the great Lammas kidnap? Is this a Christian feast?

Eivor … first one to Burgred gets to string him up by his dangly man-wattle. Then jab him in his fat head.

Id: [0x002B1E65]
I'm eager to see you fight, Eivor. Show us old wolves a thing or two.

Id: [0x002B1E66]

And what would you sacrifice for infinite knowledge?

I owe you my life, friend.

Id: [0x002B1E92]
I stand with Geadric.

Id: [0x002B1E93]
We must bring down Eadwyn once and for all.

Id: [0x002B1EA3]
My verses are known all across this great land…

Id: [0x002B1EA4]
But instead I'll persist 'til you beg me to stop…

Id: [0x002B1EAE]
These dogs will destroy the city's food supply! Protect the fields with me, Eivor!

Id: [0x002B1F01]
Why do you fight on behalf of a thief? Aegir has ruined us!

Id: [0x002B1F66]
Aye, Rollo's sworn sword-sister. I've served him proud and true. You cannot think I betrayed him?

Id: [0x002B1F6A]
I was hunting! There's fine game in the trees outside the camp, and our people need meat.

Id: [0x002B1F6C]
Rabbits for stew. Rollo's favorite.

Id: [0x002B1F71]
I am shield-sworn, so long as England and that Frankish witch do not sway him from the true path. Our people deserve better.

What was your prey?

Id: [0x002B1F82]
What was your prey?

Id: [0x002B1F89]
You want to hear my story? Then bring me a mug of ale, and we'll sit and talk as equals. Elsewise you can hang.

Id: [0x002B1F8F]
Gerhild, talking with a Saxon. Couldn't hear them, but wasn't nothing good. Sure of that much.

Id: [0x002B1F92]
Hunting rabbits, wasn't I? Sick to death of carrots and turnips. Then I heard Gerhild shouting and all Hel broke loose.

Id: [0x002B1F96]
How long has your sword served Rollo?

Id: [0x002B1F97]
How long has your sword served Rollo?

Id: [0x002B1F98]
I owe his father a blood oath. If that means wiping Rollo's arse until I die, so be it.

Id: [0x002B1F9A]
I'll feast in Odin's hall one day. But not with the stain of dishonor on my hands.

Id: [0x002B1FA7]
And if Rollo was dead, that oath would be fulfilled. You must tire of battle.

Did you dream while you sleepwalked?

Id: [0x002B1FEB]
Lie with me, Eivor. Under the stars of England. Give me a last bittersweet moment before I leave her shores.

Id: [0x002B1FF1]
Come, let us return to the others. The fire is calling, the men are merry, and the mead is sweet.

Id: [0x002B1FF4]
I'll be with you tonight. But tomorrow your new life must begin. I hope you won't look back.

Ignore your purses, lads.

Id: [0x002B21A4]
Ignore your purses, lads.

Id: [0x002B21B4]
Perhaps I should leave you three alone, to hammer through your differences.

Id: [0x002B21B6]
We are unified. We only wish to see the stone, to read the runes inscribed upon it.

Id: [0x002B21B8]
No one on earth can read those runes. The language is unknown and probably long dead.

Id: [0x002B21B9]
There's no risk in letting us look.

Id: [0x002B21BB]
No risk at all.

Id: [0x002B21BD]
The Saga Stone is hidden away in the care of my acolyte. Are you ready to go see it?

Id: [0x002B21BF]
Praise thee, O Self-Begotten one, for sending these three to deliver me from my punishment.

No whispering gods led me here, Fulke. I brought myself.

Easy! Come on, let's get you back to your cot.

Id: [0x002B21F5]
Is that? No, all clear.

Id: [0x002B21F6]
You won't catch me going past Frideswid's office. Heard screaming last time.

Id: [0x002B21FA]
For the gift of your eyes, I thank you, Regna. One blue, one green. Sign of the One Reborn.

Id: [0x002B21FB]
So fascinating. So beautiful. Bless you. You have advanced the cause of our kind.

Id: [0x002B21FD]
And you are a collector of artifacts?

Id: [0x002B220E]
That's cold comfort.

That's cold comfort.

Id: [0x002B2218]
The stone is within?

Id: [0x002B2219]
My dearest friend.

Id: [0x002B221F]
I keep seeing 'em round my mum's house. Outlanders, thinking they can stink up the place.

Id: [0x002B2236]
Death to the usurpers!

Id: [0x002B2237]
Stollid Reeves! (Stupid sheriffs!)

Id: [0x002B2246]
For the stone, we will leave your lands and not return.

Id: [0x002B226D]
Only one verse of this song remains. It is my destiny to rule, it is your destiny to die. All of you!

Id: [0x002B226F]
We all have our One Day.

Id: [0x002B2274]
Come on! Take it, you fucking coward!

Id: [0x002B2275]
Hit him! Go on!

Id: [0x002B2277]
You like her?

Id: [0x002B2278]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x002B2279]
So, make her yours. Women don't need reason, they need to be told what to do.

Id: [0x002B227A]
Better you than some outlander pig breeding her.

Id: [0x002B228F]
Saint Albanes will not disappoint. It is famous for its treasures.

Id: [0x002B2291]
When you raided Saint Albanes, are you sure you saw nothing? No crypt? No prisoners?

Id: [0x002B2293]
We'll see about that.

Id: [0x002B2294]
We'll see about that.

Id: [0x002B2295]
Nothing I can recall for certain.

Id: [0x002B2324]
Of Eluric's? Is he alright, the poor boy!

Id: [0x002B2326]
A friend.

Alfida! Did they hurt you?

Id: [0x002B2333]
Takes more than some cockshy milksops to break my will. Beating a boy half to death for stealing bread? I'll not see it done.

Id: [0x002B2336]
Growling bellies mean nothing to those pay-swords.

Alfida, could we speak in private?

How it would work between me and him? I'm a poor woman, have been always. But the ealdorman… O God, help me!

Id: [0x002B2365]
I'll give him a go. How could I not, O bless!

Id: [0x002B236A]
Eluric, come you and sit with us. I have something to say…

Id: [0x002B236B]
He'll come if you call. At the lighting of the bonfire, he'll ride here to meet you.

Id: [0x002B236C]
He'll come if you call. At the lighting of the bonfire, he'll ride here to meet you.

Id: [0x002B2396]
Move, move, move!

Id: [0x002B2397]
Put your backs into it!

Id: [0x002B23C2]
My … my apple-blossom girl! Is it really you?

Id: [0x002B23C4]
It is. Though crows have left their footfalls round my eyes.

Id: [0x002B23C5]
They still shine brightly, as when we were children. Has Eivor told you all?

Id: [0x002B23CA]
Of course! You are absolutely right. And we have a lifetime to recapture what was mislaid.

Id: [0x002B23CB]
I hope it will not take that.

Id: [0x002B23CD]
Give her time, Birstan. A passion rekindled in haste will soon fall to embers.

Id: [0x002B23CE]
Give her time, Birstan. A passion rekindled in haste will soon fall to embers.

Id: [0x002B23D2]
Are we reunited? I must hear it from your lips, Alfida. It has been many summers, and I have aged ungracefully.

Id: [0x002B23D4]
I will hear your wooing, Birstan. God help me, I have nothing to keep me in Maeldun.

Id: [0x002B23D6]
Now that you are reunited, what will you do?

Id: [0x002B23D7]
Now that you are reunited, what will you do?

Id: [0x002B2406]
What? Those are my goods!

Id: [0x002B240E]
Stop that! That's my livelihood!

Id: [0x002B2410]
Everything's been destroyed. Flee!

Id: [0x002B241C]
We will use your flesh as mulch for our crops!

Id: [0x002B241D]
Fight me yourself, coward.

Id: [0x002B243A]
You will spin and drill yourself to a endless bottom.

Id: [0x002B243B]
You will spin and drill yourself to an endless bottom.

Id: [0x002B2444]
Aha! I know a cat's footfall when I hear one. Bring it here.

Id: [0x002B2446]
Havi! Tell this rump-cloud that he can't just wander about Asgard, poking his pecker into every cavern he pleases!

Id: [0x002B2449]
Mjolnir! It is time to crush!

Id: [0x002B244A]
Villains! Leave me be!

Id: [0x002B244B]
They call this pasty whelp a lord?

Id: [0x002B244C]
Look at him! Soft as unbaked bread.

Id: [0x002B24D2]
This letter. Someone wanted us to see it.

Id: [0x002B24D3]
This letter. Someone wanted us to see it.

Id: [0x002B24D8]
Wait, something's wrong…

Id: [0x002B24EC]
They lived freely but came to see him for a scrub.

Id: [0x002B24F2]
Your name, Frown-Hoard, Quick the Dead … whatever it may be, is stained forever.

Id: [0x002B24F3]
Your name, Frown-Hoard, Quick the Dead … whatever it may be, is stained forever.

Id: [0x002B24F9]
To the walls! To the walls!

Id: [0x002B24FB]
Aelfred's come! King Aelfred of Wessex! Marching up the rise with a mess of soldiers!

Id: [0x002B24FF]
Hunwald…

Id: [0x002B2500]
Hunwald…

Id: [0x002B2509]
None living or dead now equal our Havi in arrogance. To believe that you could remake your fate thus…

Id: [0x002B250A]
For all your efforts, for all your struggles, the threads of Fate still bind you as tightly as ever.

Id: [0x002B250B]
And yet … from this pattern, a single strand escapes the fray … and stubbornly clings to the weave.

Id: [0x002B250F]
Thegn Aelfgar. It's an impressive amount of land you oversee.

Id: [0x002B2510]
Thegn Aelfgar. It's an impressive amount of land you oversee.

Id: [0x002B2511]
Lady Aethelswith … you have seen better days.

Id: [0x002B255D]
There are two targets the light must strike, but only one stream.

Id: [0x002B255E]
There are two targets the light must strike, but only one stream.

Id: [0x002B255F]
By splitting the stream.

Id: [0x002B2560]
By splitting the stream.

Id: [0x002B2565]
Wait…

Id: [0x002B2566]
Wait…

Id: [0x002B2573]
That's well enough. Exactly the right spot.

Id: [0x002B2578]
A sour fruit, not as sweet as you promised.

Id: [0x002B2579]
A sour fruit, not as sweet as you promised.

Id: [0x002B257F]
Ignore them. Find the paint.

Id: [0x002B2580]
Ignore them. Find the paint.

Id: [0x002B258A]
True nature? You said this was about victory. About defeating Eadwyn!

Id: [0x002B258B]
True nature? You said this was about victory. About defeating Eadwyn!

Id: [0x002B2590]
Descended of the gods? Brother, what by Odin's eye are you saying?

Id: [0x002B2591]
Descended of the gods? Brother, what by Odin's eye are you saying?

Id: [0x002B2592]
If you want your question answered, I'll need something in return.

Id: [0x002B2594]
And each morning's dew is the fallen slobber from Hrimfaxi's foaming mouth.

Id: [0x002B2595]
And each morning's dew is the fallen slobber from Hrimfaxi's foaming mouth.

Id: [0x002B25EA]
I might be pleased for you, if I knew who this woman was and why we needed her.

Id: [0x002B25EB]
I might be pleased for you, if I knew who this woman was and why we needed her.

Id: [0x002B25EE]
Of course he is. And soon we will deliver. Come.

Id: [0x002B25EF]
I'll fight with you. But there must be limits to this chase. Geadric is counting on us.

Id: [0x002B25F0]
I'll fight with you. But there must be limits to this chase. Geadric is counting on us.

Id: [0x002B25F1]
Ah! You've timed things well. The holy woman Fulke is close by.

Id: [0x002B25F3]
I wish to speak to her! Me, your jarl! That alone is reason enough!

Id: [0x002B262A]
Hello, Your … Your worshipfulness.

Id: [0x002B262C]
And this young lad is Eluric, Alfida's brother.

Id: [0x002B262D]
And this young lad is Eluric, Alfida's brother.

Id: [0x002B2630]
I am Birstan, nothing more or less. And you are a fine, strong lad of … how old?

Id: [0x002B2631]
Nineteen summers.

Id: [0x002B2633]
Does this mean we're leaving Maeldun?

Id: [0x002B2634]
You are, my boy. To live with me in Colcestre. Perhaps I can teach you the joy of the hunt!

Id: [0x002B2637]
I'm Eluric, the man of this house. Who are you, and why have you come?

Id: [0x002B2638]
A Dane in Essexe? Now here's a day riddled with strange portents and happenings.

Id: [0x002B263A]
Yet another stay at the king's pleasure. The prison camp at Brentwood. Far to the west.

Id: [0x002B263C]
If you promise you'll find her, I will.

Id: [0x002B263E]
Do you know where they're holding Alfida?

Id: [0x002B263F]
Do you know where they're holding Alfida?

Id: [0x002B2640]
I'll bring her to the lake house north of there. Meet us there if you wish.

Id: [0x002B2641]
I'll bring her to the lake house north of there. Meet us there if you wish.

Id: [0x002B2645]
Some of Aelfred's men beat a child of the village for stealing bread. My sister would not stand by and see injustice done.

Id: [0x002B2646]
Why did they take your sister?

Id: [0x002B2647]
Why did they take your sister?

Id: [0x002B265F]
Yes, these past weeks have been stirring, breathtaking. Your passion and strength, Eivor, I've never met such a … burning soul.

Id: [0x002B2660]
Are you awakened now?

Id: [0x002B2661]
Are you awakened now?

Id: [0x002B2663]
I did. I dreamed that all my fleeting happiness was a prelude to something bigger. Glimpses of greater joy, greater love.

Id: [0x002B2683]
All gone? I never would have thought it possible! Gunlodr!

Id: [0x002B269B]
Why do we linger here? Soldiers will be coming!

Id: [0x002B269C]
Why do we linger here? Soldiers will be coming!

Id: [0x002B26A5]
Sadly the people of this shire will hardly be comforted, now that you have swelled your father's tolerance for pagans into a sin.

Id: [0x002B26A8]
Come, abbess. We should leave this young lord to his scurrying thoughts. There is nothing more of use we can say to him.

Id: [0x002B26A9]
Take care, my boy.

Id: [0x002B26C0]
Fulke, we have heard that you possess a profane stone with strange markings and the image of a tree.

Id: [0x002B26C2]
Thanks, Becs.

Id: [0x002B26C9]
That I do. A monolith I call the Saga Stone, for it came to this land with the Dane, Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002B26CA]
Do you have it?

Id: [0x002B26CF]
I'd be risking my neck telling you anything. And if my head rolls, these sick and ailing folk will follow me to the grave.

Id: [0x002B26D1]
Your ealdorman would agree. So the sooner I find him, the more quickly these prowling guards will leave your hospice.

Id: [0x002B26D2]
Your ealdorman would agree. So the sooner I find him, the more quickly these prowling guards will leave your hospice.

Id: [0x002B26D9]
Our lord was in a bad way here, and getting worse, in spite of our efforts.

Id: [0x002B26DA]
Then, quite against my instruction, some guards moved him out. I overheard them talking about a bathhouse.

Id: [0x002B26DB]
There's no working bathouse in Lincoln. So I gather they meant the old ruins just south of here, by the eastern walls.

Id: [0x002B26DD]
I pray you find him. He's in desperate need of care.

Id: [0x002B26DE]
Ruins just south of here. I'll look there, thank you.

Id: [0x002B26DF]
Ruins just south of here. I will look there, thank you.

Id: [0x002B26E1]
That's a pleasant thought.

Id: [0x002B26F1]
I know many think me foolish, inexperienced … but I would ask that they judge me by my future hopes, not my past reputation.

Id: [0x002B26F2]
If I am given sway over this land and show myself to be a poor leader, shame me, punish me, of course.

Id: [0x002B26F3]
But give me that chance. By God, I just want to have that chance.

Id: [0x002B26FA]
People say we're an odd couple. I do not care much what people say.

Id: [0x002B26FD]
My father is dead. Died of a cruel disease, apparently. Then shunted off to a cellar for burial.

Id: [0x002B26FE]
O, my love, I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002B2701]
Ah, my Swanburrow loves that one. She has a great sense of humor, my ladylove. Father would have liked her.

Id: [0x002B2704]
Right, your Dane ladylove. She sounds lovely. Too lovely to be real.

Id: [0x002B2705]
Right, your Dane ladylove. She sounds lovely. Too lovely to be real.

Id: [0x002B2706]
And here they are. As expected.

Id: [0x002B270D]
[laughs]Look at these cakes! Sweet as honey, Gunnar. You should see this.

Id: [0x002B270E]
[laughs]Look at these cakes! Sweet as honey, Gunnar. You should see this.

Id: [0x002B270F]
Gunnar?

Id: [0x002B2710]
Gunnar?

Id: [0x002B2711]
…My cakes.

Id: [0x002B2712]
…My cakes.

Id: [0x002B2714]
To be plain, Eivor, a great bear has been badgering my estate for weeks. I must do away with it if only to prevent a future tragedy.

Id: [0x002B2716]
I've seen all I need to. But Hunwald will need proof.

Id: [0x002B2717]
I've seen all I need to. But Hunwald will need proof.

Id: [0x002B2718]
Yet still he makes good company. I've been instructed to wash and prepare his earthly vessel.

Id: [0x002B2724]
Thank you, one and all. God's blessing go with you.

Id: [0x002B2726]
Stop the heathen! Raider! Viking! Stop her!

Id: [0x002B2731]
If your Hell is real, I'm glad you'll get to see it.

Id: [0x002B2732]
If your Hell is real, I'm glad you'll get to see it.

Id: [0x002B2738]
Not to say…

Id: [0x002B273A]
…but to show…

Id: [0x002B273C]
…a vision of the times to come.

Id: [0x002B2742]
Mind and spirit will surge to a time far beyond your own. To a time in which you shall be reborn.

Id: [0x002B2743]
Have you come to say what I fear?

Id: [0x002B2744]
Have you come to say what I fear?

Id: [0x002B2749]
And the great wolf Fenrir will feast upon your blood.

Id: [0x002B2770]
Brace!

Id: [0x002B2773]
Danes fighting for a Saxon King! The sagas will scorn this day!

Id: [0x002B279B]
The front gate is heavily guarded. You'll not be walking in.

Id: [0x002B27EB]
I'll find my own way.

Id: [0x002B27EC]
I'll find my own way.

Id: [0x002B2974]
No, indeed. I find a solitary comfort in my menial labors. Not something a king should admit to, I suppose.

Id: [0x002B2977]
The brothers shamed you at dinner. It's your duty to answer their insults. Don't let the matter lay unresolved.

Id: [0x002B2978]
The brothers shamed you at dinner. It's your duty to answer their insults. Don't let the matter lay unresolved.

Id: [0x002B2982]
One of Rued's men?

Id: [0x002B298A]
They'll be looking for points of entry, to sneak a herd of raiders through.

Id: [0x002B298B]
They'll be looking for points of entry, to sneak a herd of raiders through.

Id: [0x002B298E]
Before you go, Eluric … I'd suggest a long, slow walk around the lake.

Id: [0x002B298F]
Before you go, Eluric … I'd suggest a long, slow walk around the lake.

Id: [0x002B2994]
I know. I failed to impress at dinner yestereve, but fear not. The Danes will come around in time.

Id: [0x002B2999]
Let's find out, Finnr. I challenge you to a holmgang!

Id: [0x002B299F]
Let's talk it out, then.

Id: [0x002B29A9]
Too late, the challenge has been made. But a fight against Finnr wouldn't be anything to boast about. You'll fight me.

Id: [0x002B29AA]
Too late, the challenge has been made. But a fight against Finnr wouldn't be anything to boast about. You'll fight me.

Id: [0x002B29AB]
Do not make us wait long, it would not be kingly.

Id: [0x002B29AC]
Do not make us wait long, it would not be kingly.

Id: [0x002B29B4]
I'm … I'm still breathing, aren't I?

Id: [0x002B29C0]
You'll never be king at this rate. Is this the best East Anglia has to offer?

Id: [0x002B29C2]
Yes, and I'll … I'll prove it!

Id: [0x002B29D6]
Not winning the fight, but living through it.

Id: [0x002B29D7]
Stay down, Oswald. That's enough.

Id: [0x002B29D8]
Stay down, Oswald. That's enough.

Id: [0x002B29DB]
You fought bravely. Not with great skill, but with spirit. And courage.

Id: [0x002B29DC]
You fought bravely. Not with great skill, but with spirit. And courage.

Id: [0x002B29DF]
Aye, Raven-Tamer.

Id: [0x002B29E2]
You brought your weapons and armor?

Id: [0x002B29E3]
You brought your weapons and armor?

Id: [0x002B2A0A]
Here's the tongue I use for licking.

Id: [0x002B2A0B]
Here's the tongue I use for licking.

Id: [0x002B2A10]
A seaside brawl won't change the brothers' minds. Oswald must show results. Redress old wrongs. Fight back against Rued and his men.

Id: [0x002B2A13]
The raiders who attacked Beteleah have a camp down the coast. The sooner we remove them, the better.

Id: [0x002B2A20]
You sure you want to do this? Meeting Rued in the open comes with many risks.

Id: [0x002B2A21]
You sure you want to do this? Meeting Rued in the open comes with many risks.

Id: [0x002B2A25]
That would go a long way to building you up.

Id: [0x002B2A4A]
Time to wet your blade, Oswald.

Id: [0x002B2A4B]
Time to wet your blade, Oswald.

Id: [0x002B2A63]
Damn Birstan! His household is as poorly run as his lands!

Id: [0x002B2A78]
My Sweterun is a worthy woman, you coxcomb! She's an excellent cook--

Id: [0x002B2A79]
With a fine nose for truffles!

Id: [0x002B2A86]
This looks like a good spot to hide. Somewhere to wait out a Saxon attack?

Id: [0x002B2A87]
This looks like a good spot to hide. Somewhere to wait out a Saxon attack?

Id: [0x002B2A9C]
We know each other from Norway. Bid farewell to that land, but not to old friends.

Id: [0x002B2A9D]
We know each other from Norway. Bid farewell to that land, but not to old friends.

Id: [0x002B2A9E]
You're sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.

No need to hunt when the camp is full of fresh kills.

Id: [0x002B2AA7]
No need to hunt when the camp is full of fresh kills.

Id: [0x002B2AB9]
In a manor surrounded by flowers. That's where Hjorr and Ljufvina live.

Id: [0x002B2AC9]
You know Hjorr and Ljufvina? What business do you have with them?

Id: [0x002B2ACD]
Someone, please! These bollock-beards left me to rot!

Id: [0x002B2ACE]
You would cage me like an animal? Cock-tossers, all of you!

Id: [0x002B2AD5]
I had forgotten his charm, still so boyish and eager to make me happy. The silly arse.

Id: [0x002B2ADA]
The hunters were prey to a large beast or two. I can only hope that Birstan still lives.

Id: [0x002B2ADB]
The hunters were prey to a large beast or two. I can only hope that Birstan still lives.

Id: [0x002B2ADC]
He was certainly thorough in other regards.

Id: [0x002B2ADD]
I would have thought his steed and seamen spent.

Id: [0x002B2ADE]
She has not changed at all. Her soft features, her earthy strength. She will make a good wife.

Id: [0x002B2AE8]
What will I be in Colcestre? A gooseberry in the ealdorman's patch?

Id: [0x002B2AEC]
Bless the saints! Here you are, Sister, safe and well!

Id: [0x002B2AEE]
Les anglais sont des hommes.

Id: [0x002B2AF0]
Chut, ma chere. There is no use fretting.

Id: [0x002B2AF9]
They used to sacrifice John Barleycorn. So that his seed might fall on the fertile land and grow the grain anew!

Id: [0x002B2AFA]
I don't care for that pagan pomp. There is just one God now, and He gives us everything we need. In this life and the next.

Id: [0x002B2B01]
I wanted to wear a garland of meadowsweet in my hair. They say it will bring you your true love.

Id: [0x002B2B02]
Let us dance. Then perhaps you will see he has been beside you all along.

Id: [0x002B2B04]
Unhand me, fiend!

Id: [0x002B2B05]
Odin's beard! You wouldn't fool a child with that howling.

Id: [0x002B2B06]
Odin's beard! You wouldn't fool a child with that howling.

Id: [0x002B2B07]
My head is spinning with the mead and fires. I might even dance a jig or two!

Id: [0x002B2B08]
Lammas is like honey, luscious and sweet. A night to get lost in the pure joy of life and a good harvest.

Id: [0x002B2B0A]
Are you the Good Samaritan who saved my worthless skin?

Id: [0x002B2B0C]
I killed the bears that roamed here. They had you outnumbered.

Id: [0x002B2B0D]
I killed the bears that roamed here. They had you outnumbered.

Id: [0x002B2B10]
Our lord is not at home. But his wife is receiving visitors upstairs, in her usual fashion.

Id: [0x002B2B11]
I'm looking for Birstan, the ealdorman of this shire.

Id: [0x002B2B12]
I'm looking for Birstan, the ealdorman of this shire.

Id: [0x002B2B13]
Ah! A heroic-looking Dane in our midst.

Id: [0x002B2B15]
I won't deny your enthusiasm.

Id: [0x002B2B16]
I won't deny your enthusiasm.

Id: [0x002B2B25]
O, that you could, Eivor. For I am sure this hall would shake with our merry wit. But your accord must be reached with him.

Id: [0x002B2B27]
Do you yet see an ember of my Frankish fire, Raven-walker? Perhaps it dances in my eyes?

Id: [0x002B2B28]
You don't strike me as a meek Saxon wife.

Id: [0x002B2B29]
You don't strike me as a meek Saxon wife.

Id: [0x002B2B2C]
I'm being kidnapped! Kidnapped!

Id: [0x002B2B2D]
Ah, I shall faint from the sheer horror of it all!

Id: [0x002B2B2F]
Dover. The emissary is somewhere here. Perhaps I can find the letter without bloodshed?

Id: [0x002B2B30]
Dover. The emissary is somewhere here. Perhaps I can find the letter without bloodshed?

Id: [0x002B2B32]
My wife is a gracious and attentive host, Eivor. The only thing that keeps my braying thegns at bay.

Id: [0x002B2B34]
Those Saxon milk-breads. They never saw us coming!

Id: [0x002B2B3A]
All this talk of hunting makes me long for the woods.

Id: [0x002B2B3C]
Ha! She does as she must. As do I. But you will discover this soon enough.

Id: [0x002B2B3D]
Your wife awaits, Birstan. Are you not worried some other man will drench your sheets with his sweat?

Id: [0x002B2B3E]
Your wife awaits, Birstan. Are you not worried some other man will drench your sheets with his sweat?

Id: [0x002B2B3F]
Odin owns you all! Cower before your masters!

Id: [0x002B2B41]
This is what we do to Saxon god-slaves! We pillage! Pillage and plunder!

Id: [0x002B2B42]
Stand down, you Saxon dogs! The Lady of Essexe is ours!

Id: [0x002B2B43]
Stand down, you Saxon dogs! The Lady of Essexe is ours!

Id: [0x002B2B46]
You weren't here when the Saxons attacked.

Id: [0x002B2B47]
You weren't here when the Saxons attacked.

Id: [0x002B2B49]
Down!

Id: [0x002B2B60]
He's all the family I have, Birstan. If I'm to stay, you must welcome us both into your heart.

Id: [0x002B2B61]
Where's my Kadlin? What have you done with her?

Id: [0x002B2B64]
Come. Eivor…

Id: [0x002B2B66]
Ride! Go!

Id: [0x002B2B78]
Your handmaiden, you mean? The brave one dressed in royal finery? She's in chains with the others.

Id: [0x002B2B7A]
Rollo! Estrid! Aelfred's men have found you!

Id: [0x002B2B7B]
Rollo! Estrid! Aelfred's men have found you!

Id: [0x002B2B89]
If she has so much as a scratch on her…

Id: [0x002B2B95]
And now my marriage awaits your executioner's sword.

Id: [0x002B2B97]
Yes, but what is to keep me here? A loveless union and the dirt mounds of two babes who never took a breath.

Id: [0x002B2B98]
Will it not be strange to leave this place? You've lived here half your life.

Id: [0x002B2B99]
Will it not be strange to leave this place? You've lived here half your life.

Id: [0x002B2B9D]
Kjotve! Show yourself!

Id: [0x002B2BB6]
There have been tears, but also great passions. Love, foolishness, regret. Yet is that not all lives? The best lived of them?

Id: [0x002B2BB9]
You speak with some sadness. Has your time here always been tragic?

Id: [0x002B2BBA]
You speak with some sadness. Has your time here always been tragic?

Id: [0x002B2BBE]
I have. Or rather I miss the woman I was when I lived there. Somewhat freer and more hopeful.

Id: [0x002B2BC1]
Have you always missed Francia?

Id: [0x002B2BC2]
Have you always missed Francia?

Id: [0x002B2BC8]
Speed to Valhalla.

Id: [0x002B2BCF]
Is this him, your acolyte Paul?

Id: [0x002B2BD0]
Is this him, your acolyte Paul?

Id: [0x002B2BD5]
Ransacked, from floor to roof. Basim, stand guard outside.

Id: [0x002B2BD6]
Ransacked, from floor to roof. Basim, stand guard outside.

Id: [0x002B2BD9]
Brother Paul is very clever. It could be hidden anywhere.

Id: [0x002B2BDE]
Grah!

Id: [0x002B2BE0]
Alright, wait here.

Id: [0x002B2BEE]
Now it's my turn to offer you a deal, slave-whore.

Id: [0x002B2BF0]
Accept your fate and die a coward, here before your people … and I will spare the rest.

Id: [0x002B2BF7]
Hurry back, Birstan. I will join you later for the feast!

Id: [0x002B2BF8]
Hurry back, Birstan. I will join you later for the feast!

Id: [0x002B2BFB]
Guards! Guards!

Id: [0x002B2BFC]
Release the woman, Danes! If she's unharmed, we may let some of you live.

Id: [0x002B2C06]
We have their position. A Dane camp not far from here!

Id: [0x002B2C1C]
I believe he has a somewhat different idea of his future. You should talk to him.

Id: [0x002B2C1E]
Until next we meet, Eivor. The strength of Lincolnscire is yours should you need it.

Id: [0x002B2C23]
Soldiers. They brought him here as he protested, feebly. I did my best to make him comfortable … until he slipped away.

Id: [0x002B2C2C]
Would it be an imposition to ask … well, could we live with your clan? Swanburrow and I?

Id: [0x002B2C2E]
It would mean so much to her … and to me.

Id: [0x002B2C31]
O, yes, I'll pull my weight, I promise! And fight when needs be. And I won't drink more than I'm allotted.

Id: [0x002B2C34]
Thank you, Eivor. This means … it means the world to me.

Id: [0x002B2C39]
About…?

Id: [0x002B2C3A]
About…?

Id: [0x002B2C3B]
Of course you may. We'd be happy to host you, Ferocious Swan. And your charming Dane. Come when it suits you.

Id: [0x002B2C3C]
Of course you may. We'd be happy to host you, Ferocious Swan. And your charming Dane. Come when it suits you.

Id: [0x002B2C3D]
You fight with us, Hunwald. And you can drink as much as you like.

Id: [0x002B2C3E]
You fight with us, Hunwald. And you can drink as much as you like.

Id: [0x002B2C3F]
Please … I-I don't … I don't know.

Id: [0x002B2C42]
Those are the hands of one who washes linens … a servant.

Id: [0x002B2C43]
Those are the hands of one who washes linens … a servant.

Id: [0x002B2C46]
Are you the head sister here?

Id: [0x002B2C47]
Are you the head sister here?

Id: [0x002B2C48]
Stop! Please!

Id: [0x002B2C4D]
Kjotve! Let's end this bloodshed.

Id: [0x002B2C4E]
O, I will!

Id: [0x002B2C51]
Fire!

Id: [0x002B2C56]
I won't miss him, but Acha will need some time to grieve.

Id: [0x002B2C59]
She is only naive to her present danger. But she will soon understand.

Id: [0x002B2C5A]
You hear that, Eivor? Noble. Selfless. This is the sort you must strike a bargain with. A woman of quality.

Id: [0x002B2C5C]
That's the folly of mankind, Herefrith. We wallow in our failures like happy pigs in a sty of shit.

Id: [0x002B2C5D]
That's the folly of mankind, Herefrith. We wallow in our failures like happy pigs in a sty of shit.

Id: [0x002B2C5E]
You should have learned to enjoy it.

Id: [0x002B2C5F]
You should have learned to enjoy it.

Id: [0x002B2C62]
Fight, my love! Do not listen!

Id: [0x002B2C69]
This is a brothel.

Id: [0x002B2C6A]
This is a brothel.

Id: [0x002B2C6D]
Do you remember your first kill? Mine was a boyhood friend. He squealed like a piglet. Like Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002B2C6E]
O, if Ubba could see me now, he would rage with disappointment!

Id: [0x002B2C6F]
Like the old days, yes? When iron bit into flesh like teeth into bread.

Id: [0x002B2C70]
I would ask a favor, if I could.

Id: [0x002B2C72]
As ealdorman, my life may be a dangerous one. For a time anyway.

Id: [0x002B2C73]
Would you allow my Swanburrow to take refuge in your settlement? At least until I feel all danger has passed.

Id: [0x002B2C75]
Name it.

Id: [0x002B2C76]
Name it.

Id: [0x002B2C77]
We'd be happy to have her.

Id: [0x002B2C78]
We'd be happy to have her.

Id: [0x002B2C79]
We are only warming up! How good will it feel when all is afire!

Id: [0x002B2C7A]
If I kill you, I stop. No more! There is no greater prize after you!

Id: [0x002B2C8A]
I should have met you in younger days. I would be wearing your face as a trophy now!

Id: [0x002B2C8D]
So cold that light hangs in the sky. A road for the Valkyries, who carry our dead warriors to their eternal feast.

Id: [0x002B2C8E]
So cold that light hangs in the sky. A road for the Valkyries, who carry our dead warriors to their eternal feast.

Id: [0x002B2C8F]
An eternal feast would be a merry end.

Id: [0x002B2C93]
Another satellite. Damn.

Id: [0x002B2C94]
Someone's got mail…

Id: [0x002B2C95]
An invitation to a fair in Concord.

Id: [0x002B2C96]
"Bring your best crop and you may win a prize." Tempting.

Id: [0x002B2C9C]
So close to death. So cold is my heart! Where are the winged maidens?

Id: [0x002B2CA2]
I came first to help you. Your need seemed more … pressing.

Id: [0x002B2CA3]
I came first to help you. Your need seemed more … pressing.

Id: [0x002B2CA5]
They are, though time will tell if the fire is rekindled.

Id: [0x002B2CA6]
They are, though time will tell if the fire is rekindled.

Id: [0x002B2CA8]
Northeast of here, by the river's mouth. Follow me, or come when you can!

Id: [0x002B2CAA]
Go to your men if you must. Only tell me where to find you. We have much to talk about.

Id: [0x002B2CAB]
Go to your men if you must. Only tell me where to find you. We have much to talk about.

Id: [0x002B2CAD]
I'll bring him 'round, by force or persuasion. Just be ready for my signal at the Lammas festival.

Id: [0x002B2CAE]
I'll bring him 'round, by force or persuasion. Just be ready for my signal at the Lammas festival.

Id: [0x002B2CB0]
Yes, And by the gods, let Odin be watching you this night!

Id: [0x002B2CB1]
Nothing short of Kjotve's death will quench it.

Id: [0x002B2CB2]
Nothing short of Kjotve's death will quench it.

Id: [0x002B2CB5]
Let that bruised piglet run where he may. His father is dead, his clan is no more. We are the masters of Rygjafylke.

Id: [0x002B2CBA]
Which of these sad puppets will dance best when you call upon them?

Id: [0x002B2CBC]
You can never be certain where you stand in another's heart. Choose only for yourself.

Id: [0x002B2CBF]
All three have strengths and weaknesses.

Id: [0x002B2CC0]
All three have strengths and weaknesses.

Id: [0x002B2CC6]
None may follow. Loki least of all.

Id: [0x002B2CC7]
None may follow. Loki least of all.

Id: [0x002B2CD8]
Let it flow.

Id: [0x002B2CD9]
Let it flow.

Id: [0x002B2CE3]
Let it flow.

Id: [0x002B2CE9]
From the life-tree we go, to the life-tree we shall one day return.

Id: [0x002B2CEE]
None may follow. Loki least of all.

Id: [0x002B2CF1]
Now, to face our end.

Id: [0x002B2CF3]
It is done.

Id: [0x002B2CF4]
It is done.

Id: [0x002B2CF5]
It is done.

Id: [0x002B2D21]
Who is that? Come closer, now!

Id: [0x002B2D24]
It's … it's me, Ljufvina. It's Eivor.

Id: [0x002B2D25]
It's … it's me, Ljufvina. It's Eivor.

Id: [0x002B2D29]
No battle-dented Dane would ever follow this lump of lard into battle! I don't care how many shields he brings me!

Id: [0x002B2D2A]
You mean to say you refuse my gifts, Broder?

Id: [0x002B2D2B]
I don't have time for this!

Id: [0x002B2D2C]
It's a generous offering, Brother. You'd be a fool to turn your back.

Id: [0x002B2D40]
The first of many, Oswald. Have you the will to keep it up?

Id: [0x002B2D41]
The first of many, Oswald. Have you the will to keep it up?

Id: [0x002B2D70]
I will not have blood spilt needlessly in my kingdom! This has to end!

Id: [0x002B30B1]
Alive, this man was a risk.

Id: [0x002B30B2]
Alive, this man was a risk.

Id: [0x002B30C3]
Valdis. This man spoke as if he knew you.

Id: [0x002B30C5]
Rued was my husband.

Id: [0x002B30C6]
Your husband! You're married already?

Id: [0x002B30C9]
East Anglia's prosperity depends on our safety and unity. With Rued's clan stomping around, neither is possible.

Id: [0x002B30CD]
I was. We've been apart for five summers. I never expected to see him here, and I never wanted to.

Id: [0x002B30CE]
Rued will eat your lungs for supper, Oswald. Steer clear of him.

Id: [0x002B30D9]
Seems Oswald has set out for the day. I should have a word with him.

Id: [0x002B30DA]
Seems Oswald has set out for the day. I should have a word with him.

Id: [0x002B30DC]
Without you, I'd be dead. Another wasted hope for East Anglia.

Id: [0x002B30DD]
There is, there is! You won't be disappointed by what Elmenham has to offer.

Id: [0x002B30E4]
Do I? Because I'm nervous as Hell.

Id: [0x002B30EF]
Eivor? What… Who sent you? Are you with them?

Id: [0x002B310E]
I tasted glory once again! [sniffs] And it was good.

Id: [0x002B3112]
I'm glad to hear it. Now--

Id: [0x002B3113]
I'm glad to hear it. Now--

Id: [0x002B314A]
That's all for now.

Id: [0x002B314B]
That's all for now.

Id: [0x002B314D]
I have what I need for now.

Id: [0x002B314E]
I have what I need for now.

Id: [0x002B3162]
Odin gifts me a bargain! A few dead men at my feet in exchange for a ripe East Anglia and my wife returned. What a day!

Id: [0x002B3177]
Spend a couple of hours in my heady company, and I'll make you forget your name.

Id: [0x002B3178]
I'm only here for the ale. It's the best in Colcestre.

Id: [0x002B317C]
That Dane lordling better start paying his way soon. I am not a charity!

Id: [0x002B317D]
He's such an eager boy, he'll be run dry of silver by the week's end.

Id: [0x002B3181]
A good plow-sword is a rare thing. Lead the way.

Id: [0x002B3182]
A good plow-sword is a rare thing. Lead the way.

Id: [0x002B3183]
Did you hear? The Danes tried to kidnap the Lady Estrid!

Id: [0x002B3184]
I was there! I saw it! Not much of a raiding party. Just a ragtag band, chased off by Aelfred's men. Laughing as they went.

Id: [0x002B3185]
My sister lives in Maeldun. Says things are different there. Bandits steal what little they have and the guards are useless.

Id: [0x002B3186]
If Birstan spent less time hunting and more caring for his people, we would all be better for it.

Id: [0x002B3187]
Then sup on me, for I'm sweeter than mead.

Id: [0x002B318A]
Sorry, friend. I am here for mead and merriment. Nothing else.

Id: [0x002B318B]
Sorry, friend. I am here for mead and merriment. Nothing else.

Id: [0x002B318C]
Like all callow youths, hasty and ravenous. Pawing at me like a drunken lion.

Id: [0x002B318D]
Maybe you should find another profession?

Id: [0x002B3191]
Keep that up.

Id: [0x002B3192]
Keep that up.

Id: [0x002B319E]
Neither betrayed us, Ake! Gerhild is my sworn shield-sister and Lork served my father well.

Id: [0x002B31CF]
And to Eivor, without whom none of this would have been possible!

Id: [0x002B31D2]
Would you have any words of wisdom for us?

Id: [0x002B31F0]
Call it fate. I had hoped our paths would cross again, though I imagined a calmer reunion.

Id: [0x002B31F1]
Call it fate. I had hoped our paths would cross again, though I imagined a calmer reunion.

Id: [0x002B3210]
We fled one problem only to find ourselves embroiled in another.

Id: [0x002B3212]
Yes.

Id: [0x002B3215]
That works in our favor. Someone we can trust to find the answers we seek.

Id: [0x002B3216]
That works in our favor. Someone we can trust to find the answers we seek.

Id: [0x002B3251]
Hugh, isn't it? It's good to see you recovered.

Id: [0x002B3252]
Hugh, isn't it? It's good to see you recovered.

Id: [0x002B3253]
I am, thanks to you. Are you here to enjoy the feast?

Id: [0x002B3255]
It would be my honor.

Id: [0x002B3257]
I'd love to eat drink and make merry, but I have other things on my mind. Could you help me with something?

Id: [0x002B3258]
I'd love to eat drink and make merry, but I have other things on my mind. Could you help me with something?

Id: [0x002B3259]
There's a rumor going around that the Danes who tried to kidnap Estrid will strike again.

Id: [0x002B325A]
There's a rumor going around that the Danes who tried to kidnap Estrid will strike again.

Id: [0x002B325B]
Say no more, my friend. I'll vouch for you. It's the least I can do for the price of my life. Perhaps we can drink a cup or two!

Id: [0x002B3264]
How long 'til the scouts return? I want to be out there, raiding and pillaging. Not here, scratching my thighs.

Id: [0x002B3268]
Did you not have even a little fun?

Id: [0x002B326A]
A woman fights bravely against her abductors. Yet what will they do with me now? Is my virtue safe with you?

Id: [0x002B326C]
Come now, Eivor … you can stand against Aelfred's brutes, but you shudder at a maiden's gentle teasing?

Id: [0x002B326D]
To steal away a princess, it did give a thrill.

Id: [0x002B326E]
To steal away a princess, it did give a thrill.

Id: [0x002B326F]
It's not in danger if that's what you mean.

Id: [0x002B3270]
It's not in danger if that's what you mean.

Id: [0x002B327F]
Do you need more of me?

Id: [0x002B3280]
Yes! A ruse worthy of the trickster Loki. Their Idunn stolen by us mere mortals!

Id: [0x002B3283]
Thor's thunderous hammer! That was like the great days, where I stood sword to sword with your father, Rollo!

Id: [0x002B3291]
Come find me, if you like. Away from these reveling Danes.

Id: [0x002B3293]
You did well, Rollo. You and your people. Are you ready to sail?

Id: [0x002B3294]
You did well, Rollo. You and your people. Are you ready to sail?

Id: [0x002B3295]
Have a care, then. Aelfred's soldiers will be looking for Estrid, even if Birstan's will not.

Id: [0x002B3296]
Have a care, then. Aelfred's soldiers will be looking for Estrid, even if Birstan's will not.

Id: [0x002B329B]
Why does your honesty make you more alluring still? Le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point.

Id: [0x002B329C]
You make too much of it. All I have done, I did for my clan and the glory it brought me.

Id: [0x002B329D]
You make too much of it. All I have done, I did for my clan and the glory it brought me.

Id: [0x002B329F]
Do you not know me better, Eivor? Mon petit coeur est blessé. Come, I am suddenly chilly. Let us join the others by the fire.

Id: [0x002B32A0]
Isn't Rollo the man to shake you awake? He adores you.

Id: [0x002B32A1]
Isn't Rollo the man to shake you awake? He adores you.

Id: [0x002B32B0]
My old life … Francia. Mon Dieu, I feel as if I have been sleepwalking these past years, waiting for something to shake me awake.

Id: [0x002B32B1]
A new life … or an old life renewed.

Id: [0x002B32B2]
A new life … or an old life renewed.

Id: [0x002B32CF]
We'll eat your livers and drink your marrow! Saxon dregs!

Id: [0x002B32D0]
Take their ale and their women, we will feast like kings tonight!

Id: [0x002B32D8]
Ah! Blasphemy! Blasphemy!

Id: [0x002B32D9]
Alas, alack!

Id: [0x002B32DA]
What will become of my virtue?

Id: [0x002B32DB]
Unhand me, you filthy Dane! Birstan, my love! My love!

Thor's hammer. Who stuck guards by Estrid's side?

Thor's hammer. Who stuck guards by Estrid's side?

Id: [0x002B32E6]
I am proud of us. We did a good thing, for Estrid and her lord. Maybe now we can all be happy?

Id: [0x002B32ED]
Will none of you Saxons save me?

Id: [0x002B32EE]
Made me feel young again! And I have you to thank. You believed me, though I was a coward. Won't make that mistake again.

Id: [0x002B32FA]
That Frankish princess better not turn her nose up at me. I can't wait to be free of this swamp hole.

Id: [0x002B3307]
He served my father, but he always thought me a callow lackbeard.

Id: [0x002B330B]
There's a Saxon camp with a dock at Port Walton. It might be they were taken there.

Id: [0x002B330E]
Nothing more can be done here, but your warriors might still be alive. And I will need your help, after they are free.

Id: [0x002B330F]
Nothing more can be done here, but your warriors might still be alive. And I will need your help, after they are free.

Id: [0x002B3332]
Gift of the gods, you are back!

Id: [0x002B3333]
We did, we did. But it was not for us.

Id: [0x002B3350]
She is a firebrand! We have rekindled our love as if we were teenagers. Even Eluric is a welcome addition.

Id: [0x002B3352]
These are your lands. I trust in your judgment. And how is Alfida?

Id: [0x002B3353]
These are your lands. I trust in your judgment. And how is Alfida?

Id: [0x002B3355]
Going forward, I must take care. Houses can be built anew, crops will return with time, but trust … that will take longer to repair.

Id: [0x002B3357]
Such a terrible thing to happen on so holy a night. Do you think Lady Estrid still lives?

Id: [0x002B3358]
If those barbarians took her, then she is already with God.

Id: [0x002B3359]
You're right, I know you're right. It's just … it's difficult to see that end when you're still in the storm's eye.

Id: [0x002B335A]
But you have a new friend and ally in me and my clan, Soma. The end of the storm is well in sight.

Id: [0x002B335B]
But you have a new friend and ally in me and my clan, Soma. The end of the storm is well in sight.

Id: [0x002B335C]
What happened at Lammas, it all seemed very fishy to me.

Id: [0x002B335D]
I am sure I saw that Dane swanning round the brothel with Estrid!

Id: [0x002B335F]
Pish! They have asked, yes. I said it was hopeless. Then I lay upon my couch sobbing and wailing. A pretty show.

Id: [0x002B3361]
Have no fear! I shall be discreet! We will eat and sup at my hall with a few friends and family. It is there our friendship will be sealed.

Id: [0x002B3363]
Have your thegns asked why you do not look for Estrid?

Id: [0x002B3364]
Have your thegns asked why you do not look for Estrid?

Id: [0x002B3365]
That may not be enough.

Id: [0x002B3366]
That may not be enough.

Id: [0x002B3369]
You will serve my love well, hog. A haunch worthy of her arrival.

Id: [0x002B336A]
I shall suck the scrumptious marrow from your bones, you porcine devil!

Id: [0x002B336B]
Look at that fat hog! He'll make a delicious roast.

Id: [0x002B336C]
They are fearsome beasts. But tasty!

Id: [0x002B3372]
They may give you grief, but I've been nothing but amused. They're a welcome change to warring jarls and piss-sodden politics.

Id: [0x002B3373]

Id: [0x002B3377]
Some bacraut (asshole) I killed in Hibernia. Used his guts to shine my spear. Called me boneless because I move like a reed in the wind.

Id: [0x002B3378]
You would think, eh! Me, Halfdan, we'll be there. But Ubba … no … I do not think we are chasing the same victory. Not anymore.

Id: [0x002B337F]
Lork and Gerhild have been at my side all season. I don't like to doubt them, but my people are taken, and my ship is gone.

Id: [0x002B3381]
Very well. But do not let Loki whisper lies in your ear.

Id: [0x002B3384]
If the traitor lives, all of you are at risk. Let me talk to them. The innocent have nothing to hide.

Id: [0x002B3385]
If the traitor lives, all of you are at risk. Let me talk to them. The innocent have nothing to hide.

Id: [0x002B338A]
Birstan will meet you northeast of Colcestre tomorrow. You have earned all my husband promised, and more.

Id: [0x002B338D]
I should find Birstan. No doubt, he's hunting again.

Id: [0x002B338E]
I should find Birstan. No doubt, he's hunting again.

Id: [0x002B3399]
Keep it up, lads. Every little bit helps.

Id: [0x002B339A]
The farmers are starting to push back.

Id: [0x002B339B]
This is bollocks! We should be out there, fighting to take Tamworth back from the Danes!

Id: [0x002B339C]
We're to secure our food-stores first. Leofrith's orders.

Id: [0x002B339F]
Of course. And now I feel somewhat lifted. The weight is almost gone … even if my heart needs mending.

Id: [0x002B33A4]
Do not shame me, Eivor! Finish me well.

Id: [0x002B33AF]
Hunwald, are you hurt?

Id: [0x002B33B0]
Hunwald, are you hurt?

Id: [0x002B33B1]
Your ferocious swan?

Id: [0x002B33B2]
Your ferocious swan?

Id: [0x002B33B3]
Clear out, all of you! Before you kick up a fire!

Id: [0x002B33F5]
This is Harald Fairhair's kingdom now, every peak and fjord. It pains me to say it, to think it even.

Id: [0x002B33F7]
And our father his fool, the poor man.

Id: [0x002B33F8]
And our father his fool, the poor man.

Id: [0x002B3419]
Alrekstad. It thrives. In spite of our father, no doubt.

Id: [0x002B341B]
Are you sure of this?

Id: [0x002B341C]
Are you sure of this?

Id: [0x002B3463]
The Ragnarssons are the least of your worries, Burgred. The Raven Clan now sits upon your southern border.

Id: [0x002B3464]
The Ragnarssons are the least of your worries, Burgred. The Raven Clan now sits upon your southern border.

Id: [0x002B346D]
O, I've heard tales of the Raven Clan. I see their leader, Sigurd, among you.

Id: [0x002B346E]
Lord, give me strength!

Id: [0x002B346F]
And who might you be?

Id: [0x002B3471]
And I am proud to say, I have forged quite a friendship with the Danes to the north.

Id: [0x002B3473]
Eivor, a word if you don't mind.

Id: [0x002B3477]
I deeply regret my churlish ways when we first met. I did not treat you as my God commands … with kindness and love.

Id: [0x002B3478]
I'll find the time.

Id: [0x002B3479]
I'll find the time.

Id: [0x002B347A]
Is the word "Christ" or "pagan"?

Id: [0x002B347B]
Is the word "Christ" or "pagan"?

Id: [0x002B347C]
Lord have mercy on that woman. She should have said something. It was her duty to say something.

Id: [0x002B3481]
Eivor, here with Sigurd Jarl. We are friends to these men, and foes to you.

Id: [0x002B3482]
Eivor of the Raven Clan, here with Sigurd Jarl. We are friends to these men, and foes to you.

Id: [0x002B3483]
As king, it is my most solemn duty to confer the title of ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B348F]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002B3491]
Don't undercut your own ferocity, drengr. It was your blade leading the charge! You are indeed something to behold.

Id: [0x002B3494]
Bah. Soon merchants and priests and reeves (sheriffs) will run loose in its streets. All of its muddy charms will dwindle.

Id: [0x002B3495]
Beside, with no room for me in Soma's heart, my home burned away in a quiet little house fire.

Id: [0x002B3497]
So I've decided I'm of better use elsewhere. With you, in your crew!

Id: [0x002B349B]
Birna, you struck quite a victory today.

Id: [0x002B349C]
Birna, you struck quite a victory today.

Id: [0x002B34A5]
And sail and raid with you. If you'll have me. And look at this … who wouldn't?

Id: [0x002B34A9]
You want to live with the Raven Clan?

Id: [0x002B34AA]
You want to live with the Raven Clan?

Id: [0x002B34AB]
I'll be happy to have you, drengr.

Id: [0x002B34AC]
I'll be happy to have you, drengr.

Id: [0x002B34B1]
What a mess. A sea of ashes. I thank you, Eivor, for doing what you could.

Id: [0x002B34BC]
I went through hell to bring you here. It had better be worth it.

Id: [0x002B34BE]
A betrayal like that is already a kind of death. Galinn killed himself.

Id: [0x002B34BF]
A betrayal like that is already a kind of death. Galinn killed himself.

Id: [0x002B34D8]
Your vision took you as far as the mountain's peak. But there was only room for one to stand.

Id: [0x002B34DA]
I'm the one standing.

Id: [0x002B34DE]
Please, Soma … my life in the lap of the gods. Please…

Id: [0x002B34F2]
You live. Sweet gods among us, Birna, you're alive.

Id: [0x002B34F5]
[scoff]Galinn couldn't kill me. It's not my destiny.

Id: [0x002B3504]
Look. They're alive!

Id: [0x002B3505]
Look. They're alive!

Id: [0x002B350E]
Lif? Lif, you're alive!

Id: [0x002B3512]
Not luck! Tactics. Evil men like to talk.

Id: [0x002B3522]
These wounds are deep. You're lucky to be breathing.

Id: [0x002B3523]
These wounds are deep. You're lucky to be breathing.

Id: [0x002B3539]
I'd have done the same in your position.

Id: [0x002B353A]
I'd have done the same in your position.

Id: [0x002B353C]
And … there's something else.

Id: [0x002B353F]
As we prepared our assault, Birna had a word with me.

Id: [0x002B3542]
We came to a sort of … understanding. It may be best if she tells you herself.

Id: [0x002B3547]
That is calming to hear. Which reminds me…

Id: [0x002B354A]
Ah, while I have you, Eivor, I'm reminded …

Id: [0x002B3550]
I have this for you. Keep it, knowing you have my highest respect, regard, and trust. My army is yours should you need it.

Id: [0x002B3556]
Soma Jarlskona … my deepest thanks.

Id: [0x002B3557]
Soma Jarlskona … my deepest thanks.

Id: [0x002B3558]
A relief to these ears … I've already packed my bags.

Id: [0x002B355B]
Yes, quite. In any case, thank you for putting this mystery to rest. I do hope we'll see you at the moot.

Id: [0x002B3564]
It's the sigil of my family, the last ruling house of the Kingdom of Lindsey … before it was swallowed by Mercia.

Id: [0x002B3565]
My father gave it to me in trust. One of only two that remain. It's value is immeasurable.

Id: [0x002B3567]
Why is this brooch so important?

Id: [0x002B3568]
Why is this brooch so important?

Id: [0x002B356F]
Take your men and go. East Anglia is strong with Saxons and Danes united. It will not fall to raiders.

Id: [0x002B3580]
You … I don't know you.

Id: [0x002B3588]
It's not for myself I must cast this stone, but for my clan. Who will serve us best in a time of true need?

Id: [0x002B3589]
It's not for myself I must cast this stone, but for my clan. Who will serve us best in a time of true need?

Id: [0x002B35B1]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan. The clan your men attacked before I fed them to the crows.

Id: [0x002B35B2]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan. The clan your men attacked before I fed them to the crows.

Id: [0x002B35B3]
You don't need to know my name. You will not have a use for it beyond today.

Id: [0x002B35B4]
You don't need to know my name. You won't have a use for it beyond today.

Id: [0x002B35B5]
Any questions you have, you ask the King of East Anglia. And bend the knee while you do.

Id: [0x002B35B6]
Any questions you have, you ask the King of East Anglia. And bend the knee while you do.

Tonight I ride the flaming sea-steed, rushing for the spear-din. A watcher alight on water's wake, another glory I will keep.

Tonight I ride the flaming sea-steed, rushing for the spear-din. A watcher alight on water's wake, another glory I will keep.

Id: [0x002B35FA]
East Anglia's the prize, let it be heard!

Id: [0x002B3605]
I accept.

Id: [0x002B367D]
I accept! A fight to the death!

Id: [0x002B368F]
Another Saxon king has bent the knee!

Id: [0x002B36AC]
This was Oswald's…

Id: [0x002B36AD]
This was Oswald's…

Id: [0x002B36CC]
Oswald!

Id: [0x002B36D6]
No one has been willing to take a stand against Rued's clan before. We're a kingdom of farmers and merchants.

Id: [0x002B36DB]
They've left none alive!

Id: [0x002B36DD]
Neither will we.

Id: [0x002B36DE]
Neither will we.

Id: [0x002B36E2]
There may be prisoners here. Keep an eye out for them.

Id: [0x002B36E4]
If I see any, I'll let you know.

Id: [0x002B36E5]
If I see any, I'll let you know.

Id: [0x002B3733]
Well, Eivor of the Raven Clan, as you can see, I'm in the middle of something.

Id: [0x002B3737]
King Ricsige, I am Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002B3738]
King Ricsige, I am Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002B373A]
Abbess! Look! They are burning all of these passages. Why are you not stopping this?

Id: [0x002B3747]
Enough! The more you argue, the more my head hurts.

Id: [0x002B374A]
She is here somewhere, and as of last month, Sigurd was with her. But there is no guarantee this will be the case tomorrow.

Id: [0x002B374B]
So what of the joy-canker Fulke? In your message you say you tracked her to Cent.

Id: [0x002B374C]
So what of the joy-canker Fulke? In your message you say you tracked her to Cent.

Id: [0x002B3750]
We are deep in their god's heartland, a heathen and a heretic. To hunt Fulke, we'll need a Christian snare.

Id: [0x002B3767]
I've made a friend. Abbot Cynebert. Full of pious fire, but with ambition that far outweighs his wit.

Id: [0x002B3768]
Fulke is hardly a saint herself. These Christians abhor her strange ideas.

Id: [0x002B3769]
Fulke is hardly a saint herself. These Christians abhor her strange ideas.

Id: [0x002B377D]
We're wasting time, Basim. Fulke took Sigurd for some dark purpose. Let's find them before it blackens.

Id: [0x002B377E]
We're wasting time, Basim. Fulke took Sigurd for some dark purpose. Let's find them before it blackens.

Id: [0x002B37AD]
I agree. The time for talk is long past.

Id: [0x002B37C7]
So, what is your plan?

Id: [0x002B37C8]
So, what is your plan?

Id: [0x002B37E0]
Abbot Cynebert. This is the Norse I spoke of.

Id: [0x002B37E1]
Is this not a blessed plot? God's own country. And this Eden should be given to his servants to tend.

Id: [0x002B3838]
This Norse is one who knows the value of silence and secrecy. The perfect choice for our subtle business.

Id: [0x002B384E]
If you know where Fulke is, do not rattle my bucket. Tell me now and we'll talk terms later.

Id: [0x002B384F]
If you know where Fulke is, do not rattle my bucket. Tell me now and we'll talk terms later.

Id: [0x002B387A]
The hot-tempered one stirs up strife, Basim! Will this rebellion-caked Dane do what I ask?

Id: [0x002B3893]
Speak your terms plainly, abbot. I will decide if the bargain is worth my time.

Id: [0x002B3894]
Speak your terms plainly, abbot. I will decide if the bargain is worth my time.

Id: [0x002B3896]
Here is the rectory. The abbess said she suspected secrecy among the priests and bishop.

Id: [0x002B3897]
Here is the rectory. The abbess said she suspected secrecy among the priests and bishop.

Id: [0x002B38A5]
Oof … the stench. He looks like Surtr's shit.

Id: [0x002B38A6]
Oof … the stench. He looks like Surtr's shit.

Id: [0x002B38A7]
Where are my men, you lapdogs?

Id: [0x002B38A8]
I may be drunk, but you are as ugly as a hog!

Id: [0x002B38A9]
Surrender to Rollo Longshanks!

Id: [0x002B38B4]
As a man of God, I cannot. Besides, he who stands behind the throne can better pull on the puppet's threads.

Id: [0x002B38B6]
Surrender, Rollo the Imprudent!

Id: [0x002B38BD]
Cynebert is ambitious, but well-connected. We will not find Fulke without him.

Id: [0x002B38BF]
I am not done playing with these Christians yet. I will see you in Folcanstan.

Id: [0x002B38C0]
Enough, you drunken fool!

Id: [0x002B38C1]
Come quietly or die, lackbeard!

Id: [0x002B38F8]
I have.

Id: [0x002B38F9]
I have.

Id: [0x002B38FF]
I'll get the ealdorman's name, you find Fulke.

Id: [0x002B3900]
I'll get the ealdorman's name, you find Fulke.

Id: [0x002B3903]
Well, you've chosen your friends poorly, though that's to be expected of a lowborn Dane.

Id: [0x002B3926]
Ah! Your wolf shows its teeth, Basim.

Id: [0x002B393F]
You plunged your knife deep into the heart of this kingdom.

Id: [0x002B3940]
You plunged your knife deep into the heart of this kingdom.

Id: [0x002B3944]
That is right. We've got a number of Saxon nobles lined up with their lips puckered, ready to kiss our asses.

Id: [0x002B399E]
I don't know that I will ever be comfortable in a seat not shaped for me. But I must do my best. For the people of Mercia.

Id: [0x002B39A1]
Lord. Are you comfortable yet?

Id: [0x002B39A2]
Lord. Are you comfortable yet?

Id: [0x002B39A3]
I wanted to visit. See how you were doing.

Id: [0x002B39A4]
I wanted to visit. See how you were doing.

Id: [0x002B39BA]
She means to erase me! To banish me from your minds! Fight in my name! Die for me! Die for me!

Id: [0x002B39BE]
Their lives meant nothing. No land, no riches, no titles! But my name will live on.

Id: [0x002B39BF]
Their lives for yours. Is that how it works?

Id: [0x002B39C0]
Their lives for yours. Is that how it works?

Id: [0x002B39C1]
Eivor, you've been a guiding light. Calling out Galinn like that, exposing his treachery, made me sick with a quiet terror.

Id: [0x002B39C5]
So be it. The riches I had in life gave me power. To curse me from beyond the grave gives me still more.

Id: [0x002B39C6]
Though I die, my order lives on elsewhere, everywhere.

Id: [0x002B39CA]
The reputation of a good man never dies. But your name will soon be a curse.

Id: [0x002B39CB]
The reputation of a good man never dies. But your name will soon be a curse.

Id: [0x002B39DD]
Until next time, Eivor of the Raven Clan. I hope we will see you in Grantebridge soon.

Id: [0x002B39E2]
Get this drengr back to the longboats. We're going home.

Id: [0x002B39E5]
Let's get him back to the longboats. We're going home.

Id: [0x002B39F4]
If I give my life, will you spare my clan?

Id: [0x002B39F5]
You have my word.

Id: [0x002B39F6]
Kill them all!

Id: [0x002B3A1B]
Ah, that's a … a bit of a story, that is. She took her loss badly, and tried to end her own life.

Id: [0x002B3A1C]
Eivor, didn't expect to see you here.

Id: [0x002B3A2A]
As all well know, this shiremoot's decision is not final, but advisory. It now falls to our newly anointed king, Ceolwulf, to ratify our choice.

Id: [0x002B3A2E]
Our good and noble friend, Aethelwid--

Id: [0x002B3A32]
A septic rot has overtaken this shire! A sickness for which there is only one cure!

Id: [0x002B3A34]
Your Grace, what is this?

Id: [0x002B3A37]
For the glory of the ancients! Leave none alive!

Id: [0x002B3A3C]
Nobles of Lincolnscire, stand fast!

Id: [0x002B3A3D]
Nobles of Lincolnscire, stand fast!

Id: [0x002B3A3E]
There's all manner of beasts in this forest. If we don't find the bear, we'll find something worth our supper.

Id: [0x002B3A41]
I have a divine rule over the land on my estate. God shall provide, have no worry.

Id: [0x002B3A43]
I can tell you a few things. But not here in the open. Follow me.

Id: [0x002B3A44]
Do you know where your ealdorman is?

Id: [0x002B3A45]
Do you know where your ealdorman is?

Id: [0x002B3A48]
O, I know loads of things about our ealdorman. I know his favorite foods, I know when his bedclothes get changed, and I know he hates being bled with leeches. That sort of thing.

Id: [0x002B3A4A]
This is far enough. Tell me what you know.

Id: [0x002B3A4B]
This is far enough. Tell me what you know.

Id: [0x002B3A4C]
But where has he gone?

Id: [0x002B3A4D]
But where has he gone?

Id: [0x002B3A50]
Ah, where? I have no bloody idea. Is that what you asked me?

Id: [0x002B3A56]
I'm in this fight with you! A clutch of puny Mercians don't frighten me.

Id: [0x002B3A57]
My people are fleeing. They must get to safety.

Id: [0x002B3A58]
Someone waited until you were away to set your world aflame.

Id: [0x002B3A59]
I'll send them straight to Hell, the marauding menaces!

Id: [0x002B3A5A]
The crops, the fields! They're burning the food!

Id: [0x002B3A5B]
Food's no good if there's nowhere to eat it! The houses burn, Eivor!

Id: [0x002B3A5D]
I don't. And if you like your hide where it's at, you won't ask that 'round here again!

Id: [0x002B3A5E]
You there. Do you know where your ealdorman has gone?

Id: [0x002B3A5F]
You there. Do you know where your ealdorman has gone?

Id: [0x002B3A61]
I … I … I don't know. Ealdorman who? Sorry, I'm busy!

Id: [0x002B3A62]
Where is the ealdorman? Did you see where he went?

Id: [0x002B3A63]
Where is the ealdorman? Did you see where he went?

Id: [0x002B3A65]
He was … quite poorly. But he has the heart of a lion and the holy spirit itself within him! A bout of illness would never bring him low.

Id: [0x002B3A67]
O, yes, yes indeed! The thegns and clergy of Lincolnscire are not fond of me, but they do not yet know me well enough. Not truly.

Id: [0x002B3A68]
How was your father the last time you saw him?

Id: [0x002B3A69]
How was your father the last time you saw him?

Id: [0x002B3A6A]
Did he think highly of you?

Id: [0x002B3A6B]
Did he think highly of you?

Id: [0x002B3A6C]
I live! I'm alive! Heaven have mercy!

Id: [0x002B3A74]
Raeganhare? He's an old fixture of my family's household. Loyal to the end.

Id: [0x002B3A75]
He helps run the place, and he's known me since I was but a little lordling!

Id: [0x002B3A76]
A simple fellow, but worth every pinch of his salt!

Id: [0x002B3A77]
Who was that fellow?

Id: [0x002B3A78]
Who was that fellow?

Id: [0x002B3A7C]
That must be the tree Acha mentioned. Hunwald may be nearby.

Id: [0x002B3A7D]
That must be the tree Acha mentioned. Hunwald may be nearby.

Id: [0x002B3A7E]
As your ealdorman, I will work to better this shire, to foster peace between its people, and to serve our king. I bless you all.

Id: [0x002B3A81]
To this end, we need not worry. Ceolwulf is a friend to Saxon and Dane alike, and he is sure to approve the results.

Id: [0x002B3A8D]
And he has spoken with a ringing voice! The Bishop Herefrith shall be Lincolnscire's ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B3A90]
Psalm seventy eight, seventy two. "David shepherded his flock by the integrity of his heart, and guided them by the skill of his hands."

Id: [0x002B3A91]
So I shall lead, with heart and hand as one. God bless you all.

Id: [0x002B3A9B]
Eivor … you have gifted me a great honor, one I hope I can repay.

Id: [0x002B3AA3]
One you must repay, as our tradition demands.

Id: [0x002B3AA4]
One you must repay, as our tradition demands.

Id: [0x002B3AA9]
Yes, of course. Have no doubt. We are friends, you and I, from this moment forward.

Id: [0x002B3AAA]
Only call and I shall come.

Id: [0x002B3AB0]
I want your holy word that Lincolnscire will be a friend to the Raven Clan, through the thickest and darkest of troubles.

Id: [0x002B3AB1]
I want your holy word that Lincolnscire will be a friend to the Raven Clan, through the thickest and darkest of troubles.

Id: [0x002B3AB2]
Thank you, bishop. Take care of your sheep.

Id: [0x002B3AB3]
Thank you, bishop. Take care of your sheep.

Id: [0x002B3AB4]
And shear that one from time to time. For his own good.

Id: [0x002B3AB5]
And shear that one from time to time. For his own good.

Id: [0x002B3AD4]
Hold back 'til I know it's safe. Once the brazier is lit, you join me inside.

Id: [0x002B3AD5]
Hold back 'til I know it's safe. Once the brazier is lit, you join me inside.

Id: [0x002B3B08]
Who called for me? Was it you, Valdis … my love?

Id: [0x002B3B0A]
Must I set sail for Denmark with nothing to show for the journey? After coming all this way?

Id: [0x002B3B0B]
You'll have my weight in silver. And an abundance of livestock and grain.

Id: [0x002B3B0C]
I've taken ten times that already. What's the real prize?

Id: [0x002B3B10]
I'll make you an offer, pig-foot. A holmgang, just you and me, for the future of your kingdom.

Id: [0x002B3B1D]
My work is incomplete, but not inconsequential. There are others who carry on, for one of the four is us.

Id: [0x002B3B1E]
We have seen time and time again what happens when people are left to interpret for themselves.

Id: [0x002B3B25]
When you see your chance, lead Valdis and the brothers to safety. They must not fight today. East Anglia needs them.

Id: [0x002B3B29]
Let me be your champion.

Id: [0x002B3B2A]
Let me be your champion.

Id: [0x002B3B35]
Go! Now!

Id: [0x002B3B36]
Go! Now!

Id: [0x002B3B37]
No. He called on me.

Id: [0x002B3B3C]
To Helheim, where colder and crueler fires await.

Id: [0x002B3B3D]
To Helheim, where colder and crueler fires await.

Id: [0x002B3B45]
Now I go, a flame that grows bright, and burns evermore, ever light.

Id: [0x002B3B49]
This fire that burns inside … I've always had it. A longing to do something grand and important.

Id: [0x002B3B4B]
The day where there is but one truth draws nearer. One truth, that is what The Order offers.

Id: [0x002B3B62]
Who I am is no concern of yours.

Id: [0x002B3B63]
Who I am is no concern of yours.

Id: [0x002B3B6D]
I'm the one you sing of, bard. Stern of eye and scant of mercy. Have you not seen the ravens feasting in my wake?

Id: [0x002B3B6E]
I'm the one you sing of, bard. Stern of eye and scant of mercy. Have you not seen the ravens feasting in my wake?

Id: [0x002B3B70]
Enough! Your word-mangles are making my hair ache!

Id: [0x002B3B71]
If I know Bjorngeld, he'll be drunk and sober six times before he's back.

Id: [0x002B3B74]
If speech is silver and silence is golden, then you are rich indeed, Eivor!

Id: [0x002B3B76]
I'm a better hunter than talker.

Id: [0x002B3B77]
I'm a better hunter than talker.

Id: [0x002B3B78]
Gowan the dandelion, for the seeds of my stories flit upon the winds of Wessex! But why, mule, do you kick my noggin?

Id: [0x002B3B79]
Are you the tale-weaver?

Id: [0x002B3B7A]
Are you the tale-weaver?

Id: [0x002B3BA8]
What happened in Mercia still puzzles me. Fulke saw something in Sigurd. A power, a legacy. What is it she wants?

Id: [0x002B3BA9]
What happened in Mercia still puzzles me. Fulke saw something in Sigurd. A power, a legacy. What is it she wants?

Id: [0x002B3BAA]
And what exactly were you doing there?

Id: [0x002B3BAB]
Me? What? Well … you know, the beer! They have the best ale in all Colcestre.

Id: [0x002B3BAE]
Eivor, dearheart! You who drew back the bow of Eros and reunited me with my one true love.

Id: [0x002B3BAF]
Tut tut! The wind is soft upon our faces, and I am far from the whispering doors of Colcestre. Come, let's hunt!

Id: [0x002B3BB1]
A feast for your mistress? Birstan, if this ruse falls apart, King Aelfred will strip you of your title. Our alliance would be worthless.

Id: [0x002B3BB2]
A feast for your mistress? Birstan, if this ruse falls apart, King Aelfred will strip you of your title. Our alliance would be worthless.

Id: [0x002B3BC0]
Ah, this is the spot, the best boar here!

Id: [0x002B3BE1]
And they've eaten us out of hearth and home! We have but one cask of ale and two roasted pheasants left.

Id: [0x002B3BE2]
Let us hope Birstan has at least killed a boar or two, or his thegns will add inhospitality to their list of complaints.

Id: [0x002B3BE3]
Birstan's thegns disrespect you, lady. Sour ale in the air, muddy boot steps all over the floors! Ces Anglais sont des cochons.

Id: [0x002B3BEC]
Cochons! Filthy swine!

Id: [0x002B3C16]
This land hides its secrets well, but no secret is safe from me.

Id: [0x002B3C17]
This land hides its secrets well, but no secret is safe from me.

Id: [0x002B3C44]
I should wait for Estrid.

Id: [0x002B3C45]
I should wait for Estrid.

Id: [0x002B3C46]
Bring the Mead. As soon as you can.

Id: [0x002B3C49]
Saxons come from the north!

Id: [0x002B3C62]
I'm only sniffing it. I seem to have lost my thirst.

Id: [0x002B3C63]
Go easy on the mead, lord. It's a long ride to Grimsby.

Id: [0x002B3C64]
Go easy on the mead, lord. It's a long ride to Grimsby.

Id: [0x002B3C66]
I know. I've always known. I think I wanted this only as a means to remember my father.

Id: [0x002B3C68]
Herefrith was the right man for this seat, Hunwald. He has influence and respect. Something you have yet to earn.

Id: [0x002B3C69]
Herefrith was the right man for this seat, Hunwald. He has influence and respect. Something you have yet to earn.

Id: [0x002B3C6A]
There are better ways to honor his memory. Like a drink and a song.

Id: [0x002B3C6B]
There are better ways to honor his memory. Like a drink and a song.

Id: [0x002B3C6C]
Yes … that's true. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B3C6F]
We'll speak again soon. I have an alliance to secure.

Id: [0x002B3C70]
We'll speak again soon. I have an alliance to secure.

Id: [0x002B3C71]
Name your need.

Id: [0x002B3C78]
This city, with these people … it's not where you belong, Hunwald. You're a Dane at heart. Go to Swanburrow and live well.

Id: [0x002B3C79]
This city, with these people … it's not where you belong, Hunwald. You're a Dane at heart. Go to Swanburrow and live well.

Id: [0x002B3C7A]
I couldn't back your claim to your father's seat, Hunwald. You're a deep-feeling man, but this work is beyond your skill.

Id: [0x002B3C7B]
I couldn't back your claim to your father's seat, Hunwald. You're a deep-feeling man, but this work is beyond your skill.

Id: [0x002B3C84]
You see Hunwald's back? Drinking and jabbering as always.

Id: [0x002B3C85]
Hun-who?

Id: [0x002B3C86]
Hunwald, son of our ealdorman. Thinks himself a real wonder, slouching with the common folk. Ponce!

Id: [0x002B3C87]
Ah, leave him be. If a man wants to drink in the dirt, let him.

Id: [0x002B3C89]
A round of mead here! And be quick about it.

Id: [0x002B3C8B]
Hunwald, do not wander!

Id: [0x002B3C8C]
Hunwald, don't wander!

Id: [0x002B3C9C]
To be sure. But I do not look forward to the toil of…

Id: [0x002B3C9E]
Sweet Lord in Heaven. The bear has returned!

Id: [0x002B3C9F]
You're a man of many riches, Aelfgar. You can rebuild.

Id: [0x002B3CA0]
You're a man of many riches, Aelfgar. You can rebuild.

Id: [0x002B3CA9]
Where is my son?

Id: [0x002B3CAC]
We sent word to Repton, but we've had no word, lord. I suggest we carry on.

Id: [0x002B3D3E]
Let no one through that door! You hear me? Not a soul gets through, or I damn you all to hellfire!

Id: [0x002B3D83]
The vote's been cast, Eivor. No taking it back.

Id: [0x002B3D88]
Yes … yes of course. We'll bury our dead, then raise a fyrd (peasant army).

Id: [0x002B3D8E]
We'll find and kill that man.

Id: [0x002B3D90]
Hunwald, will you fight with me?

Id: [0x002B3D91]
I will. For the sake of Lincolnscire, I bloody will.

Id: [0x002B3D9A]
To me! Holy warriors of Lincolnscire!

Id: [0x002B3D9B]
For the glory of Lincolnscire!

Id: [0x002B3D9E]
Fight, men! Fight until your livers hang from your mouths!

Id: [0x002B3D9F]
The prisoners! Bolster our numbers and free those prisoners!

Id: [0x002B3DA1]
Ah! I … I got him! My thanks, Aelfgar!

Id: [0x002B3DA2]
Lower the drawbridge!

Id: [0x002B3DA3]
Damn these infernal bodyguards. Like demons among men!

Id: [0x002B3DA4]
The best way to breach is with a battering ram. I should help it along.

Id: [0x002B3DA5]
The best way to breach is with a battering ram. I should help it along.

Id: [0x002B3DA6]
Gods! Herefrith has gone mad.

Id: [0x002B3DA7]
Gods! Herefrith has gone mad.

Id: [0x002B3DA8]
A challenge at last.

Id: [0x002B3DA9]
A challenge at last.

Id: [0x002B3DAA]
Because his name alone dries the tongues of my enemies. If such a hero fought beside me, I'd fear nothing.

Id: [0x002B3DAD]
We need stronger leadership in Lincolnscire. We can't go on like this, waiting for our ealdorman to heal, or suffering the idea of Hunwald taking his place.

Id: [0x002B3DAE]
And here he'll prove it…

Id: [0x002B3DBC]
And you fascinate me more with each passing moment.

Id: [0x002B3DBD]
Brother you have my head spinning.

Id: [0x002B3DBE]
Brother you have my head spinning.

Id: [0x002B3DE1]
O, for this, you must bring me Geadric's head.

Id: [0x002B3E19]
Eivor! No!

Id: [0x002B3E1D]
We do not!

Id: [0x002B3E1E]
We do not!

Id: [0x002B3E21]
Cut them down! Leave none alive!

Id: [0x002B3E32]
O, from time to time. Yes.

Id: [0x002B3E38]
Eivor … you muck-minded fool!

Id: [0x002B3E3A]
That is not for you to decide!

Id: [0x002B3E3C]
Your first oath is to your jarl. Sigurd Jarl, your brother and master.

Id: [0x002B3E3E]
I will not betray Geadric!

Id: [0x002B3E3F]
I will not betray Geadric!

Id: [0x002B3E40]
My promises are my own, and they are ironclad.

Id: [0x002B3E41]
My promises are my own, and they are ironclad.

Id: [0x002B3E46]
That was our chance to recover the stone without letting of blood.

Id: [0x002B3E4C]
That's one view, Basim. I believe there will be other chances. We can keep our oaths and find this stone together.

Id: [0x002B3E4D]
That's one view, Basim. I believe there will be other chances. We can keep our oaths and find this stone together.

Id: [0x002B3E51]
Enough!

Id: [0x002B3E52]
Stay out of this.

Id: [0x002B3E53]
Stay out of this.

Id: [0x002B3E56]
If it wasn't clear why Sigurd is in command, it is now. Your temper runs too hot, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002B3E5A]
Geadric's pathetic army will never breach the walls. We could have first taken the stone, then laid siege.

Id: [0x002B3E5B]
Eadwyn will flee to her castle. You want your stone, it will be there.

Id: [0x002B3E5C]
Eadwyn will flee to her castle. You want your stone, it will be there.

Id: [0x002B3E5D]
You think too much of yourself, Eivor. You do not have the wisdom of Odin. Come, Basim.

Id: [0x002B3E5F]
East of Oxeneforda, south of the Leah Villa, there's a place called Eatun Barn where eager merchants sell to soldiers.

Id: [0x002B3E61]
All my life, we moved as one, as family, as kin. I have always known his mind, and he mine … until this day.

Id: [0x002B3E62]
All my life, we moved as one, as family, as kin. I have always known his mind, and he mine … until this day.

Id: [0x002B3E64]
To wrest control of the shire from Eadwyn? I will.

Id: [0x002B3E67]
Geadric asked me to cripple her line of support. Would you know where she gets her rations and supplies?

Id: [0x002B3E68]
Geadric asked me to cripple her line of support. Would you know where she gets her rations and supplies?

Id: [0x002B3E6D]
Meet me there. I'll come soon.

Id: [0x002B3E6E]
Meet me there. I'll come soon.

Id: [0x002B3E7A]
I am your jarl, and I have sight and wisdom well beyond what you know.

Id: [0x002B3E80]
Sigurd, Brother. You are lost in a sea-storm of your own making.

Id: [0x002B3E81]
Sigurd, Brother. You are lost in a sea-storm of your own making.

Id: [0x002B3E86]
Sit here and bemoan your fate, Brother. I have a promise to keep. And I mean to.

Id: [0x002B3E87]
Sit here and bemoan your fate, Brother. I have a promise to keep. And I mean to.

Id: [0x002B3E88]
Is that now your stance? In spite of promises made?

Id: [0x002B3E89]
Is that now your stance? In spite of promises made?

Id: [0x002B3EC1]
Halfdan Jarl made it clear. He wants a Saxon king married to a Dane. For a greater show of unity.

Id: [0x002B3EC2]
Why not crown a Dane instead?

Id: [0x002B3EC3]
Why not crown a Dane instead?

Id: [0x002B3EE6]
It is not him. Not my Hjorr. He would never do this, he …[sigh]

Id: [0x002B3EF4]
Looks that way.

Id: [0x002B3EF5]
Looks that way.

Id: [0x002B3F61]
He may be wounded, but don't let your guard down.

Id: [0x002B3F62]
He may be wounded, but don't let your guard down.

Id: [0x002B3F6D]
He challenged me, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B3F70]
Oswald, you gutless argr swine! I'll slay the Wolf-Kissed, then hang you with your own tongue.

Id: [0x002B3F71]
Your fight is bigger than this, lord. You must rebuild East Anglia, plank by plank.

Id: [0x002B3F72]
Your fight is bigger than this, lord. You must rebuild East Anglia, plank by plank.

Id: [0x002B3F9E]
I wish it had not come to this. So much death. So much anger.

Id: [0x002B3FA6]
What's done is done.

Id: [0x002B3FA7]
What is done is done.

Id: [0x002B3FAC]
… they rushed in like wolves, killing and burning as they went!

Id: [0x002B3FAD]
It wasn't us!

Id: [0x002B3FAF]
You! Always getting in the way.

Id: [0x002B3FB2]
East Anglia can burn for all I care!

Id: [0x002B3FBE]
Your folk destroyed this country once before! Now you're doing it again!

Id: [0x002B3FBF]
We live here, you blistering fool! We were attacked as well!

Id: [0x002B3FE1]
Please, all of you!

Id: [0x002B3FE4]
Mead and pots confound the Wolf-Kissed! When they write your saga, I'll remind them of this embarrassment.

Id: [0x002B3FE5]
A waste of my time.

Id: [0x002B3FE6]
A waste of my time.

Id: [0x002B3FEC]
Cheat! It took me ages to prepare those for the challenge!

Id: [0x002B4004]
Be we Dane or Saxon, we all want the same peace … with land to till and a home to keep, without fear of Rued's violence.

Id: [0x002B4005]
Till they break the peace with another bleedin' raid!

Id: [0x002B4006]
Nonsense. Their homes are here now, same as ours. Our futures run together, not apart.

Id: [0x002B4009]
When I am king--

Id: [0x002B400B]
You will be king when I am a flying troll.

The Danes are on our doorstep, getting bolder each day!

Id: [0x002B402B]
They tried to steal the ealdorman's wife! God in Heaven, no one is safe.

Id: [0x002B4038]
A clan led by a Dane called Rued attacked this morning.

Id: [0x002B403A]
They've been sacking farms and hamlets across East Anglia for some time now, growing more brazen by the day.

Id: [0x002B403C]
They must. They just don't care.

Id: [0x002B403D]
So what happened here, Oswald?

Id: [0x002B403E]
So what happened here, Oswald?

Do they know this is Halfdan's land?

Their chaos has touched my home as well. And I'm here to see that it doesn't happen again.

Id: [0x002B404F]
My sister left for Wincestre. After her husband died, the farm fell into ruin.

Id: [0x002B4050]
Essexe is going to the dogs. Birstan would rather hunt than keep the Danes and bandits from our meadows.

Id: [0x002B4051]
It's because Estrid is Frankish. Those airs and graces, and the way she does her hair. All to steal our menfolk's eyes.

Id: [0x002B4052]
Birstan should have found himself a nice Saxon wife. Sturdy of hip, to give him a brood of fat, happy heirs.

Id: [0x002B4053]
On behalf of East Anglia, let this ring be proof of our loyalty to the Raven Clan, and all they have done for us today.

Id: [0x002B4064]
Hold. There's smoke ahead.

Id: [0x002B4065]
Hold. There's smoke ahead.

Id: [0x002B4066]
Stay here. I'll have a look.

That's Beteleah. It could be the same men who attacked at the walls of Northwic.

Id: [0x002B4078]
I believe she lived in the last house in Maeldun. A small, sweet place where fond memories were made.

Id: [0x002B407D]
Do you see how they tremble as we thunder by? It makes my guts all wobbly with glee.

Id: [0x002B407E]
I never knew you as a man given to verse!

Id: [0x002B407F]
Ah, their little worries. Their little lives. They mean nothing to me. They're flies on shit.

Id: [0x002B408F]
Starving, yes, that is not … good. I'll see to it.

Id: [0x002B409B]
…An issue that must be dealt with. Indeed.

Id: [0x002B409F]
Suffers, dear me.

Id: [0x002B40A4]
God rest their souls.

Id: [0x002B40A8]
Rued's clan. They left none alive.

Id: [0x002B40A9]
Rued's clan. They left none alive.

Id: [0x002B40AF]
There, have I not answered all your questions?

Id: [0x002B40CB]
Would you join me, Eivor? A formality before I'm crowned king. It would give us a chance to solidify this new friendship.

Id: [0x002B40CD]
I'll see you in Elmenham. Until then, I must warn the other hamlets of this danger.

Id: [0x002B40CF]
They were raiders, probably Rued's. They killed everyone, and I returned the favor.

Of course. Name the place.

Id: [0x002B40E0]
Behest? We got no money to speak of, and my sister is well past the marrying age.

Id: [0x002B40E1]
I'm looking for your sister, at the behest of another.

Id: [0x002B40E2]
I'm looking for your sister, at the behest of another.

Id: [0x002B40EA]
She will remember me, won't she? Yet what if she is married already? Or buried in the cold clay earth? No, I must not think on it.

Id: [0x002B40F4]
There you are!

Id: [0x002B40F6]
Please, do not stray far.

Id: [0x002B40F8]
Come find me at my camp, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B40FB]
No! What is this? Why are my people bound?

Id: [0x002B40FC]
Ah, this talk makes me long for the old times. The good old times!

Id: [0x002B4153]
Dead of the plague that came when he was three months born. Suiters shun your door when you have a babe on your teat.

Id: [0x002B4154]
You raised him alone? Where were your parents when he was a child?

Id: [0x002B4155]
You raised him alone? Where were your parents when he was a child?

Id: [0x002B4158]
You would judge us? My parents died and left me alone with a babe when I was little more than a girl myself.

Id: [0x002B4159]
I found him cowering like a frightened pup near your house. He may need a firmer hand.

Id: [0x002B415A]
I found him cowering like a frightened pup near your house. He may need a firmer hand.

Id: [0x002B415C]
He is a good boy. But without a father to guide him, he's grown softer than I'd hoped.

Id: [0x002B415D]
I have fought many a Dane in my time. I'm still standing.

Id: [0x002B4165]
Bah!

Id: [0x002B4167]
You're slowing.

Id: [0x002B4168]
You're slowing.

While you were drinking and whoring, Rollo, the Saxons attacked us. And these two were nowhere to be found.

Id: [0x002B4178]
Not yet. Fight me, heathen!

Id: [0x002B417E]
It's worse than I feared! So many of my people gone…

Id: [0x002B4180]
…and the rest at each other's throats. They believe one of your number is a traitor?

To stand in the way of you and Mercia is my duty. I'll die before I yield.

Id: [0x002B418A]
You know nothing, Raven-beak. My concern is for my fellow Danes. You'll find no treachery here.

Id: [0x002B418D]
You're lying. I found racks and racks of game.

Id: [0x002B418E]
You're lying. I found racks and racks of game.

Id: [0x002B418F]
You've more wit than your face suggests. I went to meet a lad from a nearby village. Rollo's not the only one who dallies with locals.

Id: [0x002B4191]
Thegn Tedmund? What are you doing here?

Id: [0x002B4192]
How dare you address me in such a defiant manner! Don't you know who I am?

Id: [0x002B4195]
Told you, I was hunting.

Id: [0x002B4197]
You're lying. I found a rack full of game nearby. Enough to feed the camp for days.

Id: [0x002B419B]
I was sleeping in the forest, wasn't I? Heard Saxons tramping through the trees, so I hid. Not fool enough to face 'em on my own.

Id: [0x002B419D]
Ask her. Says she's loyal to Rollo, but I've known her since she was a babe. Full of spite and ambition, always was.

Id: [0x002B419E]
Why should I believe you? You could be lying to save your own skin.

Forget it.

Wait here 'til I return.

Id: [0x002B41CC]
Eivor, gods above! I'm grateful you've joined us.

Id: [0x002B41D0]
Have faith, Eivor. A few hundred Saxons armed with hayforks and billhooks can be terrifying.

Id: [0x002B41F4]
Come, Eivor. Estrid awaits!

Id: [0x002B41F5]
I am keen to discuss our alliance, but not here.

Id: [0x002B4208]
Gerhild betrayed you.

Id: [0x002B4209]
Gerhild betrayed you.

Id: [0x002B420A]
No, that's not true! Rollo, I beg you…

Id: [0x002B420E]
Lork betrayed you.

Id: [0x002B420F]
Lork betrayed you.

Id: [0x002B4210]
Lies! And curse you, boy, for letting this outsider sway your heart!

Id: [0x002B4212]
That I do. Command me now, and I will follow your lead.

Id: [0x002B4213]
We'll free them, then you and I can talk. You owe me many favors, pup.

My axe is yours. Speak.

Id: [0x002B4217]
No, you are just one more Dane! And in that chaos, who remembers anything but the screams of dear Estrid?

So soon after Lammas. Will people there not recognize me?

Id: [0x002B4AB3]
Well met, Grim. Glad to have you along.

Id: [0x002B4AB4]
Well met, Grim. Glad to have you along.

Id: [0x002B4ABC]
I take you for desperate beggars. I can smell it on you, like dung heap. Now that's my price. What say you?

Id: [0x002B4ABE]
You have brought us all true happiness, Eivor. I thank you, from the bottom of a heart full up with joy.

Id: [0x002B4AC0]
And enough for one day I think. Even my thegns will not go hungry with this catch, and they are as voracious as wolves snatching at my carcass!

Id: [0x002B4AC1]
Come, Percy, you hapless hound! Barely a boar worried, I do not know why I keep you in my employ.

Id: [0x002B4ACA]
Three men, three possible futures.

Id: [0x002B4ACB]
Three men, three possible futures.

The bishop? That's an odd strategy.

The bishop? That's an odd strategy.

Id: [0x002B4ACF]
I don't doubt your convictions, lord.

Id: [0x002B4AD0]
I don't doubt your convictions, lord.

Id: [0x002B4AD1]
For the shire!

Id: [0x002B4AD2]
Down with Lady Eadwyn.

Id: [0x002B4AD3]
For God and Mercia!

Id: [0x002B4AD7]
Do you?

Id: [0x002B4AD9]
He invoked the name of an ancient order before his men attacked. I know exactly what possessed him.

Id: [0x002B4ADA]

Id: [0x002B4ADB]
It's not a story for now.

Id: [0x002B4ADC]
It's not a story for now.

Id: [0x002B4ADD]
Estrid should have ruled this land, I would have followed her anywhere.

Id: [0x002B4ADF]
As far as I know. It is a rite of initiation that dates back to just before the birth of the Christian Jesus.

Id: [0x002B4AE4]
And is there room in your Valhalla for a ferocious swan?

Id: [0x002B4AE5]
If they fight with the bravery of double their number, we may.

Id: [0x002B4AE6]
If they fight with the bravery of double their number, we may.

Id: [0x002B4AE8]
Chieftain Eivor. Can we win this battle with the small number you see assembled here?

Id: [0x002B4AEA]
Then we'll have no cause for worry.

Id: [0x002B4AEB]
If they fight as strongly as they smell, we'll claim victory.

Id: [0x002B4AEC]
If they fight as strongly as they smell, we'll claim victory.

Id: [0x002B4AF1]
That's the one. Do you know what he means?

Id: [0x002B4AF3]
The Order of Ancients?

Id: [0x002B4AF4]
The Order of Ancients?

Id: [0x002B4AF5]
I may.

Id: [0x002B4AF6]
I may.

Id: [0x002B4AF8]
Chieftain Eivor! We are ever so glad you came.

Id: [0x002B4AFA]
The bishop caught us unaware. Claims to have taken this shire in the name of some sort of religious order.

Id: [0x002B4AFB]
As our hastily elected ealdorman, I advise we attack quickly, before he can rally more  troops.

Id: [0x002B4AFC]
How could I not? It was my vote that got you into this mess.

Id: [0x002B4AFD]
How could I not? It was my vote that got you into this mess.

Id: [0x002B4B19]
Thank you. Feel free to take a look around as you wish. Search the city, the tunnel.

Id: [0x002B4B1B]
Basim has given me one task here. To locate and eliminate The Order of Ancients in England, in whatever dark corners they reside.

Id: [0x002B4B1F]
If an evil man brings you biscuits, do you gift them to your children?

Id: [0x002B4B20]
I would let my children starve. A serpent's gift will always end in malice.

Id: [0x002B4B22]
Sweet from evil remains sweet. Even if it crumbles quickly in their hands.

Id: [0x002B4B23]
Sweet from evil remains sweet. Even if it crumbles quickly in their hands.

Id: [0x002B4B48]
Eivor. I must thank you for your fearless participation in our moot.

Id: [0x002B4B70]
Eivor, I hope it's not untoward of me to solicit your support.

Id: [0x002B4B9D]
But you stopped that from happening. We owe you a debt of gratitude. You can be sure Halfdan Jarl will hear of this.

Id: [0x002B4BA2]
If the threat is gone, then you have my gratitude as well. I'm alive today, and so are many others because of you.

Id: [0x002B4BBC]
You have earned it.

Id: [0x002B4BBE]
What do you propose we do with it?

Id: [0x002B4BC5]
It has a nice sound to it. You honor me, lord.

Id: [0x002B4BC6]
It has a nice sound to it. You honor me, lord.

Id: [0x002B4BE7]
A wise suggestion. I agree.

Hardworking merchants were robbed of their wares.

Without resources, Halfdan's army will perish against the Picts.

He deserves death, Oswald. That's our way.

Id: [0x002B4C12]
He deserves death, Oswald. That is our way.

Id: [0x002B4C13]
We have a saying in Bjarmia. "Only the dead get to complain."

Id: [0x002B4C19]
I suppose I can forego the element of surprise. I hired a silversmith to craft a love token for Ljufvina. A Yuletide gift.

Id: [0x002B4C20]
Wait!

Id: [0x002B4C22]
Until our paths cross again, old friend.

Id: [0x002B4C26]
One last thing. The silver on your desk, Hjorr. It planted a seed of doubt in my mind, so I must know. What is it for?

Must you win at everything?

Id: [0x002B4C3E]
You lost!

Id: [0x002B4C50]
I've had my fill.

Id: [0x002B4C55]
It's as much yours as it is Oswald's.

It's as much yours as it is Oswald's.

Id: [0x002B4C57]
ALETHEIA

Id: [0x002B4C61]
You are Tedmund, as I've said. And I mean no disrespect, lord … but I was told you were back in Rouecistre.

Id: [0x002B4C66]
I'm not who you think I am! Let me go!

Id: [0x002B4C67]
O yes? And do I, um … do I look like I'm in Rouecistre?

Id: [0x002B4C69]
Right, well … that aside, have you any further orders, lord?

Id: [0x002B4C6A]
Yes, yes. I order … I order you … to stop loitering and return to your barracks, you scab-wit.

Id: [0x002B4C70]
You travel in strange company, lord. An Arab and … a Dane?

Id: [0x002B4C7D]
My king! … He … he--

Id: [0x002B4C81]
To Hel with this talk. Let Saxon blood soak this land!

You mistake me for a foreigner, but are we not all just the measure of the places we have seen?

Id: [0x002B4C8B]
You mistake me for a foreigner, but are we not all just the measure of the places we have seen?

Id: [0x002B4C91]
That is correct! A cultural exchange of sorts … perhaps one day I will visit … your … um … Dane … Dane-land.

Id: [0x002B4C92]
I'm here to advise your thegn in the ways of my people.

Come, Faravid, help me secure this hoard. I could use a bloody walk.

Id: [0x002B4CBA]
And we are still living.

Id: [0x002B4CBB]
And we are still living.

Id: [0x002B4CF9]
We'll be watching your back.

Id: [0x002B4CFD]
Dunwic…

Id: [0x002B4D24]
Do you believe in true love, Eivor?

Id: [0x002B4D26]
But have you truly? Has a longing burned in your breast, a sweet, lingering pain? Paralyzing you with its sting?

Id: [0x002B4D28]
I long for it. The thrill of a fight softly won. My wife Estrid lacks fire. She is a fish out of water. Cold and dead.

Id: [0x002B4D2A]
O, they love her, it is true. Some with too much devotion. And I have not been a good and attentive husband.

Id: [0x002B4D2C]
I have always been a plucked goose in matters of love. And a piss-poor ruler to boot.

Id: [0x002B4D2E]
My hand would rather tug the catgut of a well-crafted bow, my eyes narrowing at the sight of prey.

Id: [0x002B4D30]
Then let us run wild and free in the woods as the wolves do! Live on our wits. Prowl and stalk and feast.

Id: [0x002B4D32]
No, these builders are lost to the annals of time. Far advanced of the Saxon hovels of wattle and daub.

Id: [0x002B4D34]
I have ambition to build a great palace, myself. With mosaics and balmy courtyards.

Id: [0x002B4D36]
That which stops all but the most creative minds. Coin, imagination, talent.

Id: [0x002B4D38]
That is a question I never really ponder. I suppose they are. I hope they are.

Id: [0x002B4D42]
Why did you ask me here?

Id: [0x002B4D43]
Why did you ask me here?

Id: [0x002B4D44]
I have loved.

There is pain enough in battle, I do not seek it out in love.

Id: [0x002B4D47]

Aye. A crown sits heavy on the head.

And your people? Is Essexe happy?

He interferes?

No, not unless Halfdan sent you.

Id: [0x002B4D69]
Finnr?

Id: [0x002B4D6A]
Finnr?

Id: [0x002B4D86]
I sought pleasure with the silver I received from The Order. I shared it too, with many in need.

Id: [0x002B4D95]
The sooner I can make her my wife, the happier I will be. But we are fine to wait until everything has settled here.

Id: [0x002B4D97]
We will be ready when you are.

Id: [0x002B4D99]
Wonderful! Shall we gather everyone?

Id: [0x002B4DA3]
About you and Brigid. When do you wish to be wed?

Id: [0x002B4DA4]
About you and Brigid. When do you wish to be wed?

Id: [0x002B4DA6]

Gather your wife and your courage. I will bring the people together.

Id: [0x002B4DAE]
But Oswald's not the sort of man you'd chase into battle with a grin. He's soft. And the settled Danes don't trust him.

Id: [0x002B4DAF]
If you go by the north gates and along the road, you may catch him.

Id: [0x002B4DB5]
He needs more than a kicking! He's got nothing he should have to win this fight. No courage, no army, no charisma!

Id: [0x002B4DB7]
You're the sorriest soldier I've met in this country. Kick your king in the arse and fight back.

Id: [0x002B4DB8]
You're the sorriest soldier I've met in this country. Kick your king in the arse and fight back.

Id: [0x002B4DC1]
It's not coyness that keeps me quiet, Birstan. We grew close. I won't say more.

Id: [0x002B4DC2]
It's not coyness that keeps me quiet, Birstan. We grew close. I won't say more.

Id: [0x002B4DC5]
Are you jealous, Birstan? After casting her aside?

Id: [0x002B4DC6]
Are you jealous, Birstan? After casting her aside?

Id: [0x002B4DC7]
All that to say, I am only glad she has found a chance at happiness again. Lord knows I could not give her that.

Id: [0x002B4DC8]
But these are grim thoughts, and I will not let them lay their cold grip upon me. Tonight we feast and celebrate!

Id: [0x002B4DCA]
Beautifully said, my friend! Beautifully said.

Id: [0x002B4DCC]
Very well. Come find me in Colcestre, my friend!

Id: [0x002B4DD3]
What of it? I forged good from what you call evil. Lives were improved, lives worth more than the silver that paid for them.

Id: [0x002B4DD4]
You live here because you took our land!

Id: [0x002B4DE2]
You won. I concede defeat. When scops mention me, they will sing of my conquests.

Id: [0x002B4DE4]
I am no coward. In a long lost battle for Wessex, I was the victor. The scop could speak of that time. Focus on my lost honor.

Id: [0x002B4DE5]
Cowards do not get sagas.

Id: [0x002B4DE6]
Cowards do not get sagas.

Id: [0x002B4DE7]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002B4DE8]
When I am your king, I'll set things right.

Id: [0x002B4DEF]
There is much that is new in this old fling. Alfida is changed … the girl I fell in love with lies behind years of hardship.

Id: [0x002B4DF1]
A soft lad, but with a heart as stout as his sister's. Their closeness does them both credit.

Id: [0x002B4DF2]
The way he looks at me is often strange. His eyes furtive and downcast, like a hound waiting for his master's crop.

Id: [0x002B4DF4]
Yes, yes. But tell me, Eivor. Did you succumb to my flighted bird's charms? She can turn one atremble with her eyes.

Id: [0x002B4DF6]
Do not be coy. It does not suit you.

Id: [0x002B4E12]
Birstan! You promised we would never be apart, not for one waking or sleeping moment! And already you're sneaking out to hunt?

Id: [0x002B4E14]
[laugh]For the feast, sweetling. We owe our mutual friend a great debt. One that I promised to repay over suckling pig and ale.

Id: [0x002B4E16]
Sister, have you forgotten where you are?

Id: [0x002B4E18]
I have a right to happiness, Eluric! Or am I to play nursemaid forever, you ungrateful pup?

Id: [0x002B4E1A]
Happiness, yes. But you embarrass yourself nightly, heaving and sweating with this ham hock!

Id: [0x002B4E1B]
Hold your tongue, boy! Lest we both speak our truths.

Id: [0x002B4E1C]
What truth have you to speak? That you've returned to this fickle man who abandoned you years ago for a Frankish pet?

Id: [0x002B4E1D]
A woman he paid this Dane to abduct in that Lammas shadow play?

Id: [0x002B4E1F]
Or that you let him sniff and paw you and take him to your bed on a promise of nothing?

Id: [0x002B4E20]
The whole of Essexe whispers now! He's married still, his wife freshly stolen, and you are no more than … than his …

Id: [0x002B4E22]
I am the mother of his child, you whelp!

Id: [0x002B4E24]
Please, my boy, I…

Id: [0x002B4E25]
I will never forgive you for this. Never!

Id: [0x002B4E27]
My lord! Joyous news! God smiles upon us this very day!

Id: [0x002B4E29]
Mind yourself, boy.

Id: [0x002B4E2A]
Mind yourself, boy.

Id: [0x002B4E34]
Hush, angel. Do not fret so.

Id: [0x002B4E35]
He hates me. What have I done? We must go after him!

Id: [0x002B4E37]
Travel with me, Eivor. We can discuss my tenuous future on the road home.

Id: [0x002B4E38]
Lately I've come to learn you are the hook that all hopes hang upon. As king, you could unite all Saxons and friendly Danes.

Id: [0x002B4E39]
Lately I've come to learn you are the hook that all hopes hang upon. As king, you could unite all the Saxons and friendly Danes.

Id: [0x002B4E47]
Rollo! Aelfred's men have found you!

Id: [0x002B4E48]
Rollo! Aelfred's men have found you!

What? How can this be?

Id: [0x002B4E4D]
Her brothers don't approve of me.

Id: [0x002B4E52]
Lork! Odin, no!

Id: [0x002B4E54]
Lork, stand by Estrid, guard her with your life. If she is taken, all is lost for us and Birstan.

Id: [0x002B4E55]
Lork, stand by Estrid, guard her with your life. If she is taken, all is lost for us and Birstan.

Id: [0x002B4E56]
Come, lady. It would not do for them to take you back.

Id: [0x002B4E58]
Gerhild … you fetid blood-blister! Was it you?

Id: [0x002B4E5A]
Saxons! We have your whore-queen! Come take her.

Id: [0x002B4E5E]
Treacherous she-wolf! Damn you!

Id: [0x002B4E60]
Gerhild, you protect Estrid. If she is taken, all is lost for Birstan.

Id: [0x002B4E61]
Gerhild, you protect Estrid. If she is taken, all is lost for Birstan.

Id: [0x002B4E64]
Gods! Gerhild the traitor? I should have listened to my gut! I always hated the way she carried herself, glared at me.

Id: [0x002B4E65]
Stop chiding yourself, Rollo. You could not have known it would come to this.

Id: [0x002B4E67]
I can stand … If I can lean upon you, Rollo?

Id: [0x002B4E69]
If we stay here, we die. Come, sweet bird, I'll take you to the ship, and we'll tend your wounds. You will see Francia yet.

Id: [0x002B4E6B]
Estrid!

Id: [0x002B4E6C]
Estrid!

Id: [0x002B4E6D]
Can you move? I can pull the arrow from you, but I fear what pain it will cause.

Estrid's wound was grave. But she'll live long enough to see the shores of Francia. If only that.

You, Birstan's hired Dane. Do not think what you did went unseen. Yet tell me one thing. Is Estrid safe? And happy?

Id: [0x002B4EA7]
Good. Now leave. And if we meet again, you will fall by my sword.

Ha!

If you joined us at dinner, that might ease their minds a touch. Think about it. My doors are open to you.

Id: [0x002B4EBF]
Yes, yes, you're absolutely right. I'm merely hoping you might provide me with … perspective.

Id: [0x002B4EC1]
That I can do.

Id: [0x002B4EC2]
That I can do.

Id: [0x002B4EC3]
Wonderful. Visit us in Elmenham, whenever you have time.

Id: [0x002B4EC7]
You will.

Id: [0x002B4EC8]
You will.

Id: [0x002B4ECB]
I wish my life had been a carnival of drinking ale and pissing.

Id: [0x002B4ECC]
No, we have not reached such a point. I used The Order to live a life of ale-drinking, but the price of my ale was murder. Sad really.

Id: [0x002B4ED0]
The archbishop never suspected my heresy. I kept secrets as I gathered believers. I appeared so pious, my eyes bled for him.

Id: [0x002B4ED1]
When I told the archbishop my true belief, he was horrified. So I silenced him.

Id: [0x002B4F25]
This one would not have come alone. I should find the others.

The first man I killed for my Order, I cried and wept after trying to hold back the tears.

Pebbles were once bedrock. As were you.

Lady. Let us get past the anger and find our way to an agreement. What is your husband's greatest concern?

These Hidden Ones, is that who you slave for?

Id: [0x002B4F40]
Ah, listen! Do you hear? The excuses of a mind enslaved.[laugh]

Id: [0x002B4F4F]
Ah, I feel better. Stronger.

The royal treasury has been depleted by the war. This brings immense strain to Rhodri and his every decision.

Id: [0x002B4F5C]
I have a wedding to plan and a Kingdom to save. I haven't time to suffer fools.

Id: [0x002B4F5E]
They betrayed your hospitality, Oswald. Where I'm from, that's a grave insult.

I shall. The Kingdom of Gwynedd thanks you.

Id: [0x002B4F6B]
The treasure you spoke of would help bring us to peace.

Id: [0x002B4F6E]
Are we in league, Dane? To buy me a throne? What say you?

Id: [0x002B4F71]
Take this silver, depose your brother, and you'll rule with our support.

There's no man you can lead, you dunce of the fyrds …

You found me out. I bow to this. But you will not unearth us all, you will not dig deeply enough.

Id: [0x002B4F8D]
Why would you ask such a question at such a time as this?

Beneath your words is something of a size unknown. A mystery. It lurks behind every frail word from your mouth.

Offa told everyone he was Christian. He was not, he was one of us. He only wanted the silver and the swords for his men of Mercia.

Id: [0x002B4F97]
Without flinching. Without hesitating. Offa would be proud of me.

Id: [0x002B4F99]
It feels thus.

We must all turn to The Order. It keeps people well-placed. It is not truth, but true power.

No, no, no … I place power on power. The great becomes greater. You will see.

Id: [0x002B4FA4]

He was, but the Picts hit us hard. We were separated.

Id: [0x002B500F]
My share of the treasure we took from those distant days. I buried it here for a rainy day. This bag is heavy with silver.

Id: [0x002B5015]
You deny me?

Id: [0x002B5016]
I do. To gift you an army puts my wealth and reputation at risk. That's not what Halfdan wants. He needs a strong and loyal king.

Id: [0x002B5019]
These rain-sodden bogs and fog-washed hill are not my home, thank Christ. I come from Francia.

Sadly, my conquests are reduced to pettish thegns and graceless men. All Frankish fire extinguished.

A deliciously teasing sentiment.

Only by reputation.

Intriguing! We Saxons hear only that Danes and Norse are ferocious barbarians, all teeth and claws, with little subtlety or wit.

They did. There is no balm for my tortured heart.

Aelfred believes I rule like a chick-less hen. Flapping and squawking over nothing but the farmer's dinner.

No, he disapproves. Is that not infinitely worse? But look, we are nearing my hall.

Yet she has berated me many times for taking Estrid to my bed. I did not think her a hypocrite.

Id: [0x002B5057]
She always had ambition, but she accepted my leadership, swore on her shield.

Id: [0x002B5059]
She rarely hunts. She's been a terrible shot since we were children.

He has become old and frail, but he served my father well. I would have freed him without bloodshed.

Id: [0x002B505F]
Why would he lie unless he had something to hide?

I do! Slipped away in the sword-clash. And what of you?

Not today he won't. I saw him board a ship at Avaldsnes not long ago. Sailed east, leaving our crew behind.

Dear Birstan … I cannot believe you would come for me after all these years.

(pained moan)

Id: [0x002B518A]
I must speak with him myself, man to man. There's no place for him in East Anglia. He must hear it from me.

Id: [0x002B518E]
Eivor, it is good to see you well.

Id: [0x002B5190]
Birstan. How fares your new family? Has Eluric returned?

Id: [0x002B5191]
Birstan. How fares your new family? Has Eluric returned?

Id: [0x002B5198]
He did, like a wounded pup with his tail between his legs. But I should not speak of him so. These past days he has changed.

Id: [0x002B519A]
He has accepted me … and dare I say welcomed me, as his father. For my part I have promised to be a good one to him.

Id: [0x002B519B]
Alfida was brokenhearted when she thought him lost. The reunion was emotional, but true. Now their hearts mend.

Id: [0x002B519C]
For the better? Or worse?

Id: [0x002B519D]
For the better? Or worse?

Id: [0x002B519F]
You gave me great happiness, Eivor. Essexe will always be your ally, and I your friend.

I am glad to hear it.

Id: [0x002B51A1]
I am glad to hear it.

Id: [0x002B51A2]
Up there, on the tower.

Id: [0x002B51A4]
He has, but more and more he leaves us for drinking and who know what else. He cannot let the storm of his anger calm.

Id: [0x002B51A5]
Here they come again! From the west this time!

Id: [0x002B51A6]
Look, to the north! More Saxons!

Id: [0x002B51AD]
She is a strong and merry wife, and I love her deeply, passionately. More than I thought possible.

Id: [0x002B51AE]
She promises me Eluric will return to us. It will just take him time, for pride is a hurt slow to heal.

Id: [0x002B51AF]
And Alfida, how is she?

Id: [0x002B51B0]
And Alfida, how is she?

I served the young Aethelred. He will rise one day.

Id: [0x002B51CA]
I lied to everyone. And they will never know. They will tell stories of me as a good man who served his lord.

Id: [0x002B51CD]
He is no Aelfred, from what I hear.

Id: [0x002B51CE]
He is no Aelfred, from what I hear.

Id: [0x002B51CF]

Bless you then! You've given me the family I never thought to have. You will always have my gratitude and love for that.

I'm glad for that. Be well, Alfida.

Id: [0x002B51E0]
I'm glad for that. Be well, Alfida.

Id: [0x002B51E1]
O, he comes and goes. Sometimes drunk and belligerent, sometimes cursing and eyes wet with recrimination.

Id: [0x002B51E3]
Do not be! Birstan is a loving and attentive husband. And I expected no life of love and care so late in my summers. You gave that to us.

Id: [0x002B51E5]
I'm sorry for that.

Id: [0x002B51E6]
I am sorry for that.

I cared about my family. Just my family. I loved them more than anything.

Id: [0x002B51EF]
You are a Dane! How can you speak of the value of a life? All are ranked as less-than-the-axe to you!

Id: [0x002B51F1]
You have proved here that your compassion has a hard and brutal limit.

Id: [0x002B51F3]
And the families who fell by The Order's command. Were they not worthy of love?

My brother loves me well. Yet he can be slow and stubborn. Were I king, I'd have played all this quite differently.

Id: [0x002B5200]
How do you stand with your brother?

I make no promises, but I may be able to find you the silver you need.

Id: [0x002B520C]
At the crown? I would leap at the chance to rule. But a man needs wealth to bring down a king. Nobles must be bought, you understand.

Id: [0x002B520D]
If you speak true, I would make that bargain gladly.

Id: [0x002B520E]
What if you had the chance?

Id: [0x002B520F]
What if you had the chance?

Id: [0x002B5210]
Back again, eh? Brought any treasure with you? I will see that it is well spent.

Id: [0x002B5218]
If there is any silver to be had, I'll think about it.

Id: [0x002B5219]
If there is any silver to be had, I'll think about it.

Damn your eyes. Here is the silver. Do with it what you will, but do not upset this chance at peace.

Id: [0x002B521E]
I did not know you were so foolish with coin.

Id: [0x002B5221]
Why would I call you now, after five happy years away from your stinking balls?

Id: [0x002B5222]
I called you, Rued.

Id: [0x002B5223]
You? Oswald, the hopeful king of East Anglia?

Id: [0x002B5224]
And Valdis's husband-to-be.

Id: [0x002B5227]
A good hunt, Birstan!

Tewdwr! This is Eivor, my chieftain.

Id: [0x002B522F]
None could, not from that height.

Id: [0x002B5231]
It may, it may not. I would have to see the silver in my hands to know for sure.

Id: [0x002B5232]
If I could find you silver, would that quell your bitterness while we seek peace?

Is it not plain that I do not wish to speak with you?

Id: [0x002B524C]
What is it, Dane?

Id: [0x002B5266]
You are a wise warrior. Perhaps the silver will become available.

Hmph. And you, go take a shit and let me know how it turns out.

Take this. Spend it as you will, and tell Rhodri his best path is peace.

You again. What of the silver you spoke of?

Id: [0x002B5273]
Ynyr.

Id: [0x002B5274]
Ynyr.

Id: [0x002B5278]
Yes. And I must summon a dragon.

Id: [0x002B5279]
Send a message to your men. We can build a camp here and lay plans for a surprise attack.

Id: [0x002B5286]
No, no. You have shot your chance. And if you show your faces around here once more, I will tear you limb from limb.

Id: [0x002B5287]
You heard me the first time. But I'll get what I need, one way or another.

Id: [0x002B5292]
He consults me for his every decision. If I push for war, he will agree. If I argue for peace, he will follow.

Id: [0x002B5296]
A sack of silver? For me? Hm. Yes, I might amend my advice to Rhodri for a tidy sum of shining metal. Yes.

Id: [0x002B5297]
You are with Rhodri, yes? One of his advisors?

These talks are stalled. I fear the upshot.

And are you a flyter?

Id: [0x002B52E9]
O, no, certainly not. I don't engage in such things. Haven't the head for it.

Id: [0x002B52ED]
I should mention: My brother has taken a strict vow of silence.

Id: [0x002B52EF]
If you wish to flyt, I will translate and relay his verses.

I'm Eivor. Of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002B532E]
I'll stick you like a pig!

Id: [0x002B5333]
My brother has a few parting words.

Id: [0x002B5336]
I will. Farewell to you both.

Id: [0x002B5337]
I will. Farewell to you both.

Id: [0x002B5338]
Very fine work. As an impartial observer, I must say you won.

Id: [0x002B5339]
There is a lot we would not have to do if we stuck to killing kings. Thanks to my brother, now we are into making them.

Id: [0x002B533A]
Hunwald! Watch your arse!

Id: [0x002B533B]
Thank me when the bleeding is done!

Id: [0x002B5353]
Welcome, welcome! What will it be today?

Id: [0x002B5354]
Have you got our loyalty rune? For next time...

Id: [0x002B5356]
Wouldn't wearing clothing over it defeat the purpose?

Id: [0x002B5357]
A striking look coupled with an efficient design!

Id: [0x002B5358]
Healthy, swift and smart. You won't find better this far North! Or South, for that matter.

Id: [0x002B5359]
This should liven up the view from my shop.

Id: [0x002B535B]
I think it inspires fear! A good choice.

Come in, have a look. But be warned: things go quickly!

Looking for something exciting today?

Id: [0x002B5430]
Look, but do not touch! Unless you intend to buy, then you can touch, grab and even squeeze.

Id: [0x002B5431]
Good to see you. My shop's always changing, but I'm very consistent.

Id: [0x002B5432]
Have a good day!

Id: [0x002B5433]
Thank you for your patronage.

Id: [0x002B5434]
Thank you. I am sure I will see you back again soon.

Id: [0x002B5435]
Take care of yourself out there! Drink plenty of fluids!

Id: [0x002B543A]
It has artistic merit, I give you that…

It is a bold design I had commissioned. Glad you like it!

Id: [0x002B543E]
Everything we sell has been time-tested, Reda approved.

Riding in style; crucial to the modern warrior.

Id: [0x002B5443]
Having a broad selection of mounts is simply good preparation.

Id: [0x002B5446]
The settlement does need a little more variety. Between you and me.

Id: [0x002B5447]
At least someone's doing something to spruce up the place…

Id: [0x002B544E]
Why raid in some drab tub when you can sail this Sea-Chariot?

Id: [0x002B544F]
It doesn't get much better than this, my friend!

Id: [0x002B545A]
Look, the path is untouched by danger.[Dismissing Eivor] So, your company is not needed.

Id: [0x002B545D]
You are a kinder man than the mask you wear. But, you won't be rid of me. I will keep my word to Cynon for your safe return.

Halfdan Ragnarsson, we meet in the forge of battle. Surely a good sign.

Id: [0x002B54FF]
Halfdan Ragnarsson, we meet in the forge of battle. Surely a good sign.

Id: [0x002B5500]
Without Halfdan's formal approval, I cannot help. It's too great a risk. And, after all, he is my ally. You understand.

Id: [0x002B5503]
I don't know you. One of Faravid's new dogs?

Id: [0x002B5511]
So you answered my summons. But the timing is poor as you can see. Too many here are spent … battle-sore … thirsty.

Id: [0x002B5512]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002B5513]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002B5518]
Hearsay is not enough. For all I know, this is another of Halfdan's tests.

Id: [0x002B5521]
You would do this? Draw up fake orders and pass them off as real?

Id: [0x002B5531]
Leave me be, warmonger! You have my sister, is that not enough?

Id: [0x002B554F]
The oldest son of Ragnar Lothbrok, so he says. What do you make of him?

Id: [0x002B5553]
Not here, not now.

Id: [0x002B5559]
Faravid. Have your men build field pyres for the dead.

Id: [0x002B555F]
It won't be enough. We need Ricsige's Saxons at our side. Any fewer would be a death sentence.

What happened to the silver you took from Audun? You could hire a band of sellswords with that much.

Id: [0x002B556B]
He doesn't, but he's given me leave to act as I must, for reasons I cannot share.

Id: [0x002B556C]
He doesn't, but he's given me leave to act as I must, for reasons I cannot share.

Id: [0x002B556F]
Yes, we've heard the rumors. And all our messages have gone unanswered.

Id: [0x002B5577]
Can you aid me with some trickery? Help me forge a set of orders from Halfdan himself. To force Ricsige's cooperation?

What lies ahead, I wonder?

Id: [0x002B5581]
See how they run like frightened rabbits!

Id: [0x002B5582]
Flee before our blades, you Saxon curs!

Id: [0x002B5583]
You gifted my silver to the karls and ceorls of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002B5586]
A foolish choice. The coin never left King Ricsige's treasury.

Id: [0x002B5598]
Not just any hero. Eivor brought order to the city when King Ricsige could not.

Id: [0x002B55A1]
They say you rooted out a gang of thieves and traitors.

Id: [0x002B55A3]
Not alone. But I led the charge.

Id: [0x002B55A4]
Not alone. But I led the charge.

Id: [0x002B55A7]
[laugh]You're right. You're right. Perhaps I just needed to hear it spoken aloud. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B55A8]
There's no profit in spite and self-pity. Forgive those that meant no harm. Go back to them. It's a better life than this.

Id: [0x002B55B9]
It is wasted fighting Picts. It should be put to better use.

Id: [0x002B55C9]
The silver Eivor recovered there now pays for our war with the Picts.

Id: [0x002B55CB]
For Odin! For Tyr! Victory!

Id: [0x002B55D0]
But not alone, no no. Bjorn Ironside, fearless Ubba, Ivarr the Boneless. Sigurd Snake-in-eye. Great warriors all. My brothers.

Id: [0x002B55D2]

Should a king show mercy to one so malevolent? So cruel?

Id: [0x002B5604]
Yet I wonder. Is there any skill of mine that I could impress upon you?

Id: [0x002B5609]
No, no, I will take the beach. A far more dangerous path. You search the longhouse for our crew.

Id: [0x002B560B]
I could storm the beach then. Slay two dozen men, seize our dragon-boat, and hoist the sail in triumph. Up to you.

One such affair is why we called for you.

Id: [0x002B578E]
Please Eivor, I must pray.

Id: [0x002B5790]
That sounds like a tale I'd like to lend my ear to.

You! Lay that axe aside or die by mine.

Id: [0x002B57A0]
You! Lay that axe aside or die by mine.

I thank you for your candor, Birstan. You have put my mind somewhat at ease.

Id: [0x002B57A9]
Aye.

Id: [0x002B57AA]
Indeed.

Id: [0x002B57AB]
You are a stain on this shire, Birstan! Useless.

Id: [0x002B57AC]
Useless…

Good. Yet before you do, there is something else. A gift I wish to share.

Id: [0x002B57CD]
I cannot show you here. Will you walk with me?

Id: [0x002B57CF]
A gift?

Id: [0x002B57D0]
A gift?

Id: [0x002B57DF]
Good luck in your endeavors, Eivor. I pray you find my Alfida, with a fair face and a yearning heart.

Id: [0x002B57EB]
But you saved his hide? [Loaded beat]I bet it was quite the sight, two of you as a pair.

Id: [0x002B57EE]
No. Only an observation.

Is that a question?

Id: [0x002B57FB]
It will not come from me. It is a gift you must give yourself.

Id: [0x002B57FD]
Let me say it another way. My gift is not for giving or taking. It is a way of living.

Id: [0x002B57FE]
More riddles. What fun you are.

Id: [0x002B580A]
It is a thing better demonstrated than described.

Id: [0x002B580C]
Still no clearer.

Id: [0x002B580D]
Still no clearer.

Id: [0x002B580E]
Then I will wait.

Id: [0x002B580F]
Then I will wait.

Id: [0x002B5810]
Now speak plain. Why have you come for me?

Id: [0x002B5811]
Now it's your turn. Why did you come for me?

Id: [0x002B5812]
Love him? Dear old Birstan, he remembers!

Id: [0x002B5814]
He does.

Id: [0x002B5815]
He does.

Id: [0x002B581F]
Aye, she has.

Id: [0x002B5820]
And do you accept me, love? My heart feels like it will burst.

Id: [0x002B5824]
(unintelligible)[He's a good man. One who admires you greatly.]

Id: [0x002B5825]
It takes a rare woman to nail down our Gunnar.

Id: [0x002B5826]
It takes a rare woman to nail down our Gunnar.

Id: [0x002B587B]
Father. You should have held onto this until the bitter end.

Father. You should have held onto this until the bitter end.

Id: [0x002B587E]
And what of the ship that will sail you home?

Id: [0x002B587F]
And what of the ship that will sail you home?

Id: [0x002B5883]
So, is the wedding here? When you spoke of a marriage feast, Gunnar, I hoped it would be at home.

Id: [0x002B5884]
So is the wedding here? When you spoke of a marriage feast, Gunnar, I hoped it would be at home.

Id: [0x002B5885]
(unintelligible)[I specialize in runes, spells, and charms.]

Id: [0x002B5887]
The captain's name is Hrolfr, called Rollo in my tongue. Tell him of our new plan and agree to whatever reward he demands.

Id: [0x002B5888]
Then you must forgive me. Those Saxons knew about my camp. I was mind-drunk to leave my warriors behind!

Id: [0x002B588A]
Ceolbert. You are now with your god. I am left here to mourn the loss of a fine young man.

Id: [0x002B588B]
Ceolbert. You are now with your god. I am left here to mourn the loss of a fine young man.

I need a drink.

I need a drink.

Id: [0x002B5893]
(unintelligible)[I watched the Church fathers harden Tewdwr's heart. He believes he is doing God's work.]

Id: [0x002B58A0]
Good. Not too loud. Let us hear our love of the Lord. Careful on the low note, Odo. Very good.

Id: [0x002B58A6]
(unintelligible)[We dress up as spirits and creatures of the veil to beg for treats.]

Id: [0x002B58AB]
What I have seen is my people slaughtered, my city befouled, and your delusions fueling the destruction.

Id: [0x002B58B1]
It's hardly a disguise. Just a cloak and some bones.

Id: [0x002B58B2]

Ceolbert lies here.

Ceolbert lies here.

Id: [0x002B58BE]
And spoil the surprise?

Id: [0x002B58BF]
I suspect you mean to throw me from this cliff. Is that it? Please tell me if I am near the mark.

Id: [0x002B58C0]
I suspect you mean to throw me from this cliff. Is that it? Please tell me if I am near the mark.

Id: [0x002B58C2]
Like your meditation, it centers our minds, steadies our hands, and purges fear from our hearts.

Id: [0x002B58C3]
And more practically, it aids our movements, in flight or in stealth.

Id: [0x002B58C5]
There it is again, the shadow of a doubt.

Id: [0x002B58C6]
You call it a leap. And we are climbing a rather steep hill…

Id: [0x002B58C7]
You call it a leap. And we are climbing a rather steep hill…

Id: [0x002B58C9]
To perform the Leap of Faith, you must give yourself over to something greater.

Id: [0x002B58CB]
Yourself. Embrace the hope that death will not come before you are prepared to meet it. Believe this and you will fear nothing.

Id: [0x002B58CD]
Good. Then your mind is already attuned to my lesson.

Id: [0x002B58D0]
The gods?

Id: [0x002B58D1]
The gods?

Id: [0x002B58D2]
Our deaths are prefigured, weaved into the fabric of the world. To fear this would be a waste of worry and tears.

And the children knew they should not have been out in the late, and in the dark. So they bent low to the ground.

Id: [0x002B599B]
[scream]Haha!

Id: [0x002B599D]
[laughs]Which is why none of you should run out alone to the woods tonight.

Id: [0x002B599E]
Yes, Mother Modron.

Id: [0x002B599F]
Yes, Mother Modron.

Id: [0x002B59A0]
Now, the first of you to bring me back a candied chestnut shall have a treat!

Id: [0x002B59A4]
For these whispers alone, your guards will not let me enter the festival grounds.

Id: [0x002B59A5]
For these whispers alone, your guards will not let me enter the festival grounds.

Id: [0x002B59B6]

Id: [0x002B59BB]
Modron, you do not have to save his leg. I will understand.

Id: [0x002B59BC]
Modron, you do not have to save his leg. I will understand.

Id: [0x002B59BE]
One fer me as well!

Id: [0x002B59CA]
Eivor, I have not seen this side of you before! Do not feed your fear, conquer it!

Id: [0x002B59CB]
And that loam cushioned your fall!

Id: [0x002B59CC]
And that loam cushioned your fall!

Id: [0x002B59CF]
Hmph.

Id: [0x002B59D0]
Hmph.

Id: [0x002B59D5]
A perfect fall. And how did it feel?

Id: [0x002B59D6]
(roar)

(roar)

Id: [0x002B59DC]
Rollo's still a boy, with boyish dreams.

Id: [0x002B59DE]
But he is honest. He could love you if you gave him a chance. It would be quite a match.

Id: [0x002B59DF]
But he's honest. He could love you if you gave him a chance. It'd be quite a match.

Id: [0x002B59E2]
My goodness. You're a philosopher too. I wish I had met you earlier. Years ago.

Id: [0x002B59E4]
I shouldn't. You can't start a new life by repeating the habits of the old.

Id: [0x002B59E5]
I shouldn't. You can't start a new life by repeating the habits of the old.

Shhh. Still your lips … and come here.

I have seen my death in a vision. It was not here, not today.

Id: [0x002B59F0]
I have seen my death in a vision. It was not here, not today.

Id: [0x002B59F1]
You spoke true. It was madness and vigor, a purging of fear.

Id: [0x002B59F2]
You spoke true. It was madness and vigor, a purging of fear.

Id: [0x002B59F6]
Of course not! I could not be happier. I only wondered … for her sake.

Id: [0x002B59F7]
Fair enough, I should not pry.

Id: [0x002B59F8]
Of course. And thank you, Eivor … for hearing me out.

Id: [0x002B59F9]
You called this Leap of Faith a sacred rite. Do all Hidden Ones practice this same ritual?

Id: [0x002B59FA]
You called this Leap of Faith a sacred rite. Do all Hidden Ones practice this same ritual?

Id: [0x002B59FB]
Child? Alfida…?

Id: [0x002B59FE]
Estrid has been found by Aelfred's men. They ride to her rescue as we speak!

Id: [0x002B5A02]
I might try if I believed you would join. But that is not my purpose in England. Basim and I are hunting larger prey.

Id: [0x002B5A04]
Yes. You remember the medallion you took from Kjotve's body? That is their symbol.

Id: [0x002B5A06]
They are a plague, one we hope to purge from this world.

Id: [0x002B5A07]
Like us, they act in secret. But their aim is to rule the world, not free it from unnatural fetters.

Id: [0x002B5A08]
Are you hoping to initiate me?

Id: [0x002B5A09]
Are you hoping to initiate me?

Id: [0x002B5A0A]
The Order of Ancients.

Id: [0x002B5A0B]
The Order of Ancients.

Id: [0x002B5A0E]
This is my fault, Estrid. Mine alone.

Id: [0x002B5A10]
Goddess Freyja, give me more of that!

Id: [0x002B5A12]
Come.

Id: [0x002B5A13]
Come.

Id: [0x002B5A1B]
The desire to rule is not unique to this order. Sigurd and I want the same. A land to call our own and the honor that comes with it.

Id: [0x002B5A26]
If we work together towards this end, it will benefit us both. You will have greater influence over the kingdoms of England.

Id: [0x002B5A28]
Exactly. You should begin in Lunden. I have credible reports that The Order is working now to seize the city.

Id: [0x002B5A2B]
And you will have more medallions to count.

Any slower and you'll lose two races.

Give us your coin, you bloody robbers!

Audun, we remain loyal. Things were better with you around.

Id: [0x002B5A80]
What's keeping you, friend Eivor? Waiting for spring?

Id: [0x002B5A90]
Trygve, you old hound. How are you?

Id: [0x002B5A91]
Trygve, you old hound. How are you?

Id: [0x002B5A92]
[laugh]But a healthy jarl-beard it is not.

Eivor, a friend of old is a good omen.

Id: [0x002B5AAA]
Picts rampaging through our lands, while the Saxons do nothing!

Id: [0x002B5AAB]
We conquered all of Northumbria! Never doubt a drunken Norseman.

Id: [0x002B5AAE]
The Picts are an eternal problem, plotting beyond the wall, so I doubt--

Id: [0x002B5AB8]
Thank you, Wolf-Kissed. Those men will wake up soon enough.

Id: [0x002B5ABA]
I wonder how Halfdan fares, now that he sits on the throne.

Winter's chill slowing your bones?

Id: [0x002B5AC1]
Picheringa is in the east. Just follow the road to Scarborough.

Id: [0x002B5AC5]
We need our glorious Halfdan back, strong and sure.

Id: [0x002B5AC9]
No glory, no hope. Nothing but snow, silent as a corpse in its grave.

Id: [0x002B5AD3]
There's Beonton, guarding the hammer.

Thank you, friend. You're always welcome at my hall.

Id: [0x002B5AF4]
Where's that damn thegn?

Id: [0x002B5AF5]
They said he was elusive. What am I to do now?

Id: [0x002B5AF6]
I carry the king's word, but there's no hand to put it in.

Love is a difficult feeling to command.

Id: [0x002B5B15]
Love is a difficult feeling to command.

Id: [0x002B5B2B]
O, something like, "I was stupid, selfish, reckless, blind, boneheaded, and I smell like blood and shit."

Id: [0x002B5B2F]
Gods, I love being out on the open water. The chill, the mist, the rolling waves. It gives a feeling of freedom.

Id: [0x002B5B30]
And then, to look around and see the rising fjords and glinting snow, I think, By the gods, the world is a place of wonder!

Id: [0x002B5B34]
Bah! I will feel my feelings as I always have. Without words between them and me.

Id: [0x002B5B37]
See there, the vaulted shoulder bones of sad Ymir, the bobbing seas his blood, his brains the soaring clouds.

Eivor. What did Wigmund's little man have to tell us?

Id: [0x002B5B41]
I should have lived as the ancients did.

Id: [0x002B5B44]
Haha! You heard the man, give him something stronger!

Id: [0x002B5B45]
Weak! What is this? Water? I feel like Thor chugging oceans, no effect to my head or step.

Eivor, speak true … my feelings be damned. I have been an arse, do not deny it. And I for that … I'm sorry.

[Ono: nervous laughter]And how nice is that?

I hurt my shoulder.

Id: [0x002B5BE0]
Shake it off!

Id: [0x002B5BE5]
O! Yes. My first ally as ealdorman. [puffing out his chest]I accept! We shall make an oath! [beat]How do we start?

Tewdwr, with Gunnar and Brigid's marriage, our clans will unite. But we could join by oath as well.

Maybe you are correct. I wanted to be a cardinal, but the men who raised me said I'd serve God better as an ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B5C01]
Nice enough to tell you that you are wrong for the ealdorman's seat.

Id: [0x002B5C02]

I feel warm. Do you feel warm?

Id: [0x002B5C20]
Always warm here. It's a wonder you don't walk around naked.

Id: [0x002B5C21]
Always warm here. It's a wonder you don't walk around naked.

Id: [0x002B5C2F]
Yes … erm … well, come on in.

Id: [0x002B5C31]
I have to piss.

Id: [0x002B5C3E]
Well … answering complaints and levying taxes are a bore to be honest. But the spirit of an ealdorman flows in my veins. I shall find a foothold soon enough.

Id: [0x002B5C43]
Good effort, Tewdwr. This merriment feeds my soul. Here, another drink on me. For allies new and old.

Id: [0x002B5C45]
None. It is well-known. The burdens I carry will soon leave this world with me. So drink, to my life and death!

Id: [0x002B5C48]
Horrible barbaric practice. A burnt offering after poor crops. They hope well-fed gods will smile upon them.

Id: [0x002B5C49]
I am to be sacrificed in the wicker man as King of the Harvest! Like Ealdorman Simkin before me, and all before him.

Yes, my sovereign.

Soma said I would find you here, Lif. What's your plan?

Id: [0x002B5C73]
My friends, you are kind to me. I'd like to toast my successor, Tewdwr! May he wear the horns, head high.

Id: [0x002B5C77]
A toast then, to Ealdorman Cynon! Joyous and generous! Let each man show him loyalty until he suffers death!

A toast then, to Ealdorman Cynon! Joyous and generous! Let each man show him loyalty until he suffers death!

Id: [0x002B5C7E]
To holy hearths and humid eyes. It is the best drunkenness returns a man to royal reason! Skal!

Id: [0x002B5C7F]
To holy hearths and humid eyes. It is the best drunkenness returns a man to royal reason! Skal!

Id: [0x002B5C83]
But, eat! Drink! Enjoy all that Glowecestre's lush woods offer.

Id: [0x002B5CBB]
God praise you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B5D3A]
Please, I'm just a poor Christian brother with nothing left to give!

Id: [0x002B5D3C]
Someone's at the door, Rollo.

Id: [0x002B5D3E]
O! Is it that Hun I asked for?

Id: [0x002B5D40]
Did she now? As a parting gift for the man who rattled her bones, huh?

Id: [0x002B5D42]
Can it wait?

Id: [0x002B5D44]
Oi! Bring out the one they call Rollo! The king's men want to ask him a few questions.

Id: [0x002B5D4A]
Some help here!

Id: [0x002B5D4D]
Bloody fucking Danes! Open this door.

Id: [0x002B5D53]
Follow me!

Id: [0x002B5D57]
Estrid sent me.

Id: [0x002B5D58]
Estrid sent me.

Id: [0x002B5D59]
No, I'm here to collect you.

Id: [0x002B5D5A]
No, I'm here to collect you.

Id: [0x002B5D5B]
Good day, sir, come in.

Id: [0x002B5D5C]
Good day, sir, come in.

Id: [0x002B5D5D]
Out! Now!

Id: [0x002B5D5E]
Out! Now!

Id: [0x002B5D60]
Move, move!

Id: [0x002B5D61]
Move, move!

Id: [0x002B5D67]
I … I mislaid my hammer. I think Beonton ran off with it, but I'm not … I'm not … I'm not well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B5D75]
Do you need another drink, Eivor?

Id: [0x002B5D97]
I am Halfdan Ragnarsson, Wolf of War, Lord of Jorvik, ruler of men. I am king!

Id: [0x002B5D98]
Not my king. I will not bow to a man who accuses me of treason.

Id: [0x002B5D99]
In days yet to come, men will sing the praises of Halfdan. And scorn the life of Faravid the betrayer!

Id: [0x002B5D9A]
You are the hero of a coward's tale. A man who hid behind his best men and claimed their victories for his own!

Id: [0x002B5D9B]
You are banished! Out! Never again set foot in my lands!

Id: [0x002B5DA6]
End of the road. Goodbye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B5DCE]
Eivor, make this man see sense. He is old, sick, and his mind is unclear--

Id: [0x002B5DD0]
Horseshit! You want me dead, you lying shit hog! I was a fool to not see it.

Id: [0x002B5DD2]
Halfdan, stop! This is a man of honor.

Id: [0x002B5DD3]
Halfdan, stop! This is a man of honor.

Id: [0x002B5DD6]
Treason must never go unpunished.

Id: [0x002B5DD7]
Treason must never go unpunished.

Id: [0x002B5DD8]
If any of my clan committed such a betrayal, I would rip his flesh from his bones.

Id: [0x002B5DD9]

Id: [0x002B5DDB]
After all we did together, after all we won.

Id: [0x002B5DDE]
We owe you our lives, friend. These Saxon whoresons would have killed us all.

Id: [0x002B5DE6]
I would gladly, friend. But we few will not break those iron-thick walls.

Id: [0x002B5DE7]
Yes, they would have. And now's your chance to hit back. March with us on Rouecistre and drain it of riches.

Id: [0x002B5DE8]
Yes, they would have. And now's your chance to hit back. March with us on Rouecistre and drain it of riches.

Id: [0x002B5DEC]
Fight so that they may grow, so they may be good and just, as you are. For them, today, we take back Ulkerthorpe!

Id: [0x002B5DF4]
Do I trust my own eyes? Is that truly who I see?

Id: [0x002B5E0B]
You stand beside this … this traitor?

Id: [0x002B5E10]
I do. Let truth guide us here, not madness.

Id: [0x002B5E11]
I do. Let truth guide us here, not madness.

Id: [0x002B5E29]
You are the Wolf-Kissed one, the Raven of Battle whose fame grows with each waxing of the moon.

Id: [0x002B5E3A]
I struggle with the choice Hemming left for me. I would have your council on the matter.

Id: [0x002B5E3B]
I struggle with the choice Hemming left for me. I would have your council on the matter.

Id: [0x002B5E3D]
I hope one day we may raise our spears together, old friend.

Id: [0x002B5E47]
We hope for many things in this life, yet we earn so few of them.

Id: [0x002B5E48]
We hope for many things in this life, yet we earn so few of them.

Id: [0x002B5E4D]
And what is our plan?

Id: [0x002B5E71]
Wolf-Kissed and Halfdan, well met! Come, fill your bellies with mead.

Id: [0x002B5ED6]
I was building a boat … to carry my family to safety one day.

Id: [0x002B5ED8]
A brigade of bastards? They are the only ones left ruling England. My people were of the Hwiccan Kingdom.

Id: [0x002B5EDA]
And what of the orphans you left behind? Do they get a boat?

Id: [0x002B5EDB]
And what of the orphans you left behind? Do they get a boat?

Id: [0x002B5EEA]
Basim, Eivor. To horse!

Id: [0x002B5EEF]
But I've never felt as much love for his god. Not like I do the old gods. The true gods. Our ancient creators.

Id: [0x002B5EF1]
That silence comes for you now.

Id: [0x002B5EF2]
That silence comes for you now.

Id: [0x002B5EF3]
But I told myself, I am merely acting upon a foretold destiny, navigating the whim of greater gods. My actions are simply pebbles.

Id: [0x002B5EF5]
When the fighting started, I was in my workshop, decorating a sail for our allies in Grimsby. Without my yellow paint.

Id: [0x002B5EF7]
By the time Soma gathered me to retreat, the city was under attack from within. I was nowhere near that tunnel. Nowhere.

Id: [0x002B5EFA]
Birna…

Id: [0x002B5EFC]
I should have heeded Tewdwr's misgivings about heathen party guests. And now he has paid with his life.

Id: [0x002B5EFE]
With Tewdwr gone, Glowecestre will be without an ealdorman. Eye for an eye, your Raven Clan will lose their chieftain.

Id: [0x002B5F01]
I lost so many after all this, but I still have you three. That makes me the most blessed warrior in Midgard.

Id: [0x002B5F02]
Thank you, jarlskona.

Id: [0x002B5F0E]
Very odd. How bad did it look for you to have your name so besmirched?

Id: [0x002B5F10]
Blood from head to foot, and a mess of dead guards. Someone else was a whirl of gutting, though they left no body of Tewdwr.

Blood from head to foot, and a mess of dead guards. Someone else was a whirl of gutting, though they left no body of Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002B5F12]
Her priority is Grantebridge and the people in it. That is noble, and beyond what I will ever understand.

Id: [0x002B5F18]
You squirm like that and my axe will miss your neck! Unpleasant for both of us.

Id: [0x002B5F19]
If I am to die, I want to make a mess of it, bacraut (asshole)!

Id: [0x002B5F20]
And his heart! A heart that beats in a lad like this? Feed a family of six for a week!

Id: [0x002B5F21]
Fucking Dane half-wits! The Lord will smite you from this land. All of you! May God have mercy on--

Id: [0x002B5F31]
I'm eager to start throwing torches.

Id: [0x002B5F32]
I am eager to start throwing torches.

Id: [0x002B5F45]
Bless you all. Thanks to you, I live to pay Lady Eadwyn back in blood.

Id: [0x002B5F47]
Good thegn, we are at your side in this fight. To keep this land in the hands of those who love Mercia, be they Saxon or Dane.

Id: [0x002B5F4C]
Of course. Feel free to search the shire for clues. And speak to anyone you wish.

Id: [0x002B5F4D]
Off again, Eivor. You and I, with blades drawn and hearts ablaze!

Id: [0x002B5F4F]
Such tales you siblings tell.

Id: [0x002B5F50]
Yes, Sigurd. Like old times.

Id: [0x002B5F51]
Yes, Sigurd. Like old times.

Id: [0x002B5F56]
That I can do.

Id: [0x002B5F57]
That I can do.

Id: [0x002B5F65]
We can talk safely over there.

Id: [0x002B5F69]
The madwoman, Fulke?

Id: [0x002B5F6B]
Mad or no, I want to speak with her.

Id: [0x002B5F6C]
Understand this. Fulke is a heretic. A sower of poisoned knowledge and an enemy of the Church.

Id: [0x002B5F6F]
You can speak with him in my stead. But we must hurry. Fulke's life may be in danger.

Id: [0x002B5F71]
Fulke holds a secret that may turn the tide of this fight. Without her, I cannot achieve my full purpose here.

Id: [0x002B5F73]
You see, Brother? Your mysterious Fulke has a mind in disarray.

Id: [0x002B5F74]
You see, Brother? Your mysterious Fulke has a mind in disarray.

Id: [0x002B5F75]
Sigurd, do we not owe Geadric some word of what has happened here?

Id: [0x002B5F76]
Sigurd, do we not owe Geadric some word of what has happened here?

Id: [0x002B5F77]
Can we not fixate on this cipher, Fulke? Eadwyn is our focus.

Id: [0x002B5F78]
Can we not fixate on this cipher, Fulke? Eadwyn is our focus.

Id: [0x002B5F7E]
Far enough to say it's best you stick to the countryside and wear that disguise. But Tewdwr's body has not been found as yet.

Id: [0x002B5F7F]
How far has the search for me stretched?

Id: [0x002B5F80]
How far has the search for me stretched?

Id: [0x002B5F87]
Guards! Someone save me! A murderous Dane is here to sever my head from my neck.

Id: [0x002B5F8E]
That night was full of drink and merriment. I do not remember much, but I had no quarrel with Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002B5F8F]
That night was full of drink and merriment. I do not remember much, but I had no quarrel with Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002B5FEF]
Just one of a thousand, Basim. It was the glorious dawn of our lives.

Id: [0x002B5FF1]
They cannot be lost. Something is not right.

Id: [0x002B5FF4]
The coward Gorm flees. His father dies twice today.

Soma, my raiders are here. Where are the rest of yours?

Id: [0x002B5FF9]
We were led by the hand! Into the bowels of Grantebridge, and still we could not hold the city?

Id: [0x002B5FFA]
That raving pagan handed me Grantebridge on a plate! And you dirty ceorls lost it for me!

Id: [0x002B5FFC]
O, how can a place I once called home look so alien to me now! So harsh and un-wanting. Fear not Lincoln, I shall make you mine again.

Id: [0x002B5FFF]
And you will leave this place as ashes on the wind.

Id: [0x002B6001]
You are a shadow of your father, Gorm. Weak and witless.

Id: [0x002B6002]
You are a shadow of your father, Gorm. Weak and witless.

Id: [0x002B600F]
Festive.

Id: [0x002B6010]
Festive.

Id: [0x002B6015]
You have seen what was needed?

Id: [0x002B6049]
There's a Saxon within. One stupid enough to try sending Hemming to Heaven over Valhalla.

Id: [0x002B604B]
Now he cowers behind a locked door!

Id: [0x002B604C]
I asked you a question, friend.

Id: [0x002B604D]
I asked you a question, friend.

Id: [0x002B6059]
Ricsige. I struggle to be surprised.

Id: [0x002B605D]
I only did right by his immortal soul!

Id: [0x002B605E]
You will get what is right for you!

Id: [0x002B6074]
You're not the warrior you used to be, old friend.

Id: [0x002B607D]
Traitor! Kill him! Feed him to the wolves!

Id: [0x002B607E]
Look at him, Eivor. Is this how a leader should behave? Halfdan! Come to your senses!

Id: [0x002B6094]
Go home or get hurt. But you won't bother my friends.

Id: [0x002B6095]
Go home or get hurt. But you won't bother my friends.

Id: [0x002B609C]
Enough. Let him speak to explain himself.

Id: [0x002B609D]
Enough. Let him speak to explain himself.

Id: [0x002B609E]
You are fearfully quiet, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B60A9]
I fear for Northumbria now that Halfdan is king. Many may suffer if his madness goes unchecked.

Id: [0x002B60AC]
I should demand an apology for that. But there is no need. Soon I shall be long gone. Far away across the whale-road, where the fates guide me.

Id: [0x002B60AD]
And who is to blame for his madness, Faravid?

Id: [0x002B60AE]
And who is to blame for his madness, Faravid?

Id: [0x002B60B6]
The mead gave you luck, that's all.

Id: [0x002B60B7]
The mead gave you luck, that's all.

Id: [0x002B60B8]
I offered you enough mead to best me. No excuses!

Id: [0x002B60CA]
Give me a swing at those Danes!

Id: [0x002B60DE]
Never inflict your Christian mysteries on a dead Norseman.

Id: [0x002B60DF]
Never inflict your Christian mysteries on a dead Norseman.

Hemming was never one to weep over a bit of rain. Neither should you.

Id: [0x002B60E1]
Hemming was never one to weep over a bit of rain. Neither should you.

Id: [0x002B60F0]
Absolutely not! My father would never allow such foolishness!

Id: [0x002B60FE]
Ulf! Ulf! Glory for Ulf!

Id: [0x002B6109]
I told you, that was meant to be a dragon's tail--

Id: [0x002B610E]
It is good to ride with you again, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002B610F]
It is good to ride with you again, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002B6117]
Shut your mouths, both of you. Your antics have outlasted their welcome. Now go.

Id: [0x002B6118]
Shut your mouths, both of you. Your antics have outlasted their welcome. Now go.

Id: [0x002B612E]
Nothing I can see out there.

Id: [0x002B6140]
Olav! Speak to us! Where are you?

Id: [0x002B6182]
I held you here, Vili … in one proud hand when you were fresh from your mother's womb.

Id: [0x002B6184]
I watched you grow, a dirty-haired boy, swinging sticks and running through the mud, dreaming of glory.

Id: [0x002B61B2]
Now you must choose between treason and madness. Between the serpent's fang and the bite of a rabid wolf.

Id: [0x002B61B7]
Faravid asked for my silence, but Halfdan expects the truth. If I am not careful, these lies will pile up, one upon the next.

Id: [0x002B61B8]
Faravid asked for my silence, but Halfdan expects the truth. If I am not careful, these lies will pile up, one upon the next.

Id: [0x002B61BA]
But I … I have nobody left. My life's purpose lies dead upon that pyre.

Id: [0x002B61BE]
That is not so. When people looked to my father for guidance, who did they see him turn to for counsel?

Id: [0x002B61C7]
Ah, the Wolf-Kissed is a reader. That's dark seidr (magic) I'll never mess with.

Id: [0x002B61CF]
Thank you … thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B61D6]
Trygve has no jarl to serve, Vili. He's free to set his own course to the ocean's edge, to trade this world for the next.

Id: [0x002B61D7]
Trygve has no jarl to serve, Vili. He is free to set his own course to the ocean's edge, to trade this world for the next.

Id: [0x002B61DF]
I may have. A fortress in Suthesexe. The Order trains soldiers there.

Id: [0x002B61ED]
If Hemming were here, would he not urge you to wield this wisdom for the betterment of all?

Id: [0x002B61EE]
If Hemming were here, would he not urge you to wield this wisdom for the betterment of all?

Id: [0x002B620D]
I am your servant, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B6218]
Moira. I met her at the feast.

Id: [0x002B6219]
Moira. I met her at the feast.

Id: [0x002B621B]
Moira? Who is she?

Id: [0x002B621C]
Moira? Who is she?

Id: [0x002B621E]
She's an herbalist from the North. Always skulking in the shadows of Halfdan's throne.

Id: [0x002B6231]
To arms, Basim!

Id: [0x002B6232]
To arms, Basim!

Id: [0x002B6236]
It's a big throne. Don't you all skulk around it from time to time?

Id: [0x002B6237]
It's a big throne. Don't you all skulk around it from time to time?

Id: [0x002B6239]
I see. Because Halfdan thinks I'm disloyal, now you don't trust me. Has our battle-bond earned me no favors with you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002B623B]
Why all these doubts, Eivor? You're a warrior, not a rumormonger.

Id: [0x002B623E]
Then let me change your mind. I've got a plan to win this war for good. Before the winter sets in.

Id: [0x002B6240]
Magnis is a strong fort, but we'd be attacking from the south. With speed, we'll catch them off guard.

Id: [0x002B6247]
If we tell him of this plan, he'll refuse. But if we succeed, you and I together, he'll sing our praises all the louder

Id: [0x002B6248]
Doubt is too strong a word. But there is a feeling of mistrust among you. I want this alliance to be ironclad.

Id: [0x002B6249]
Doubt is too strong a word. But there is a feeling of mistrust among you. I want this alliance to be ironclad.

Id: [0x002B624C]
With Halfdan's blessing, I'd fight beside you anywhere. Name the time and place.

Id: [0x002B624D]
With Halfdan's blessing, I'd fight beside you anywhere. Name the time and place.

Id: [0x002B624E]
No. Halfdan is done fighting for the winter. He thinks it too great a risk. But I say we can win this war before the next snows.

Id: [0x002B6251]
Come on, you lazy hounds. I don't pay you to lollygag.

Id: [0x002B6252]
I could throw a stone and hit a dozen men who'd do a better job than this!

Id: [0x002B6253]
We have a quota to fill, we must keep the Danes from Cent!

Id: [0x002B62CD]
A convincing ruse that has earned you your freedom. Go. And make your life anew, not in another man's boots.

Id: [0x002B62CE]
A convincing ruse that has earned you your freedom. Go. And make your life anew, not in another man's boots.

Id: [0x002B62D2]
God speed, Danes. This is too rich for my blood.

Id: [0x002B62D4]
Tied up like animals. I need to free them.

Id: [0x002B62D5]
Tied up like animals. I need to free them.

Id: [0x002B62DF]
Come on, you laggards! You have Tedmund's orders.

Id: [0x002B6343]
Remember our hunts beyond the northern way? Our first big kill was a ten-point deer.

Id: [0x002B6367]
I am always at peace. And never alone. I move among the people of the world with great joy.

Id: [0x002B6368]
Have you found some peace in your time alone, Basim?

Id: [0x002B6369]
Have you found some peace in your time alone, Basim?

Id: [0x002B64E8]
Yet they sit on a great many of England's thrones. If you seek to pacify England for the safety of your clan…

Id: [0x002B6550]
You on the right, me on the left, we leapt and struck!

Id: [0x002B6551]
Damn animal bit my hand! Never knew a buck could bite so hard!

Id: [0x002B6553]
With sharpened shin-bones for skinning the beast.

Id: [0x002B6554]
With sharpened shin-bones for skinning the beast.

Id: [0x002B6555]
But I pierced its throat, spilling its life-wine into the drifts. That put an end to him.

Id: [0x002B6556]

O, shit.

Id: [0x002B6570]
Have mercy! I were under orders! Ealdorman Cynon! He gave us coin to dispose of Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002B6574]
And we thought that … if we kept the lad alive we could squeeze Cynon for more coin. To keep his secret.

Id: [0x002B6577]
O, shit is right.

Id: [0x002B6578]
O, shit is right.

Id: [0x002B657B]
Then he should demand it back. Shit sellswords you are. Cannot kill a single man!

Id: [0x002B657C]
Then he should demand it back. Shit sellswords you are. Cannot kill a single man!

Id: [0x002B663B]
Lord.

Id: [0x002B663C]
Lord.

Id: [0x002B673F]
Dear Estrid, we must discuss the affairs of this land, with or without him.

Id: [0x002B67EB]
Do not compare yourself to such people. The Order has no honor, no principles. No humanity.

Id: [0x002B67F3]
Enjoy it while you can.

Id: [0x002B67F5]
There she is. Home at last.

Id: [0x002B67F6]
There she is. Home at last.

Id: [0x002B6806]
You may think this land ruled by harmless jarls and bumbling thegns, yet look more closely and you will find a deeper threat.

Id: [0x002B6809]
From the lowliest fishmonger to the richest merchants, from wealthy thegns to useless kings, The Order has corrupted all.

Id: [0x002B680B]
You desire alliances. We seek to rid England of its deepening rot.

Id: [0x002B681A]
Drinking with my warriors in the longhouse. When the Saxons came, I fought.

Id: [0x002B681B]
I couldn't have shown anyone the tunnel. Eyes were on me all day and night.

Id: [0x002B681F]
None of our longships are painted yellow. I don't think…

Id: [0x002B6820]
I found a letter telling the Saxons not to attack a longship painted yellow.

Id: [0x002B6821]
I found a letter telling the Saxons not to attack a longship painted yellow.

Id: [0x002B6824]
I've never painted any longship yellow beyond a few small touches. It's expensive. I know of no such letter.

Id: [0x002B6826]
I found this odd letter telling Saxon forces not to attack any longship painted yellow.

Id: [0x002B6827]
I found this odd letter telling Saxon forces not to attack any longship painted yellow.

Id: [0x002B6836]
There! We have time yet. They're holding the trials just ahead.

Id: [0x002B6837]
My blade is thirsty, friends. Shall we roll in like three barrels afire?

Id: [0x002B6839]
No, we must be careful. Do not let the executioner swing his axe.

Id: [0x002B683A]
No, we must be careful. Do not let the executioner swing his axe.

Id: [0x002B683C]
Strange. Only Lif would have the tools to alter the color of our longships. Something to ask him about.

Id: [0x002B683D]
I found a letter to the Saxons from Wigmund. It said not to attack any longship painted yellow.

Id: [0x002B683E]

Id: [0x002B6842]
You haven't yet explained who this Fulke woman is.

Id: [0x002B6843]
You haven't yet explained who this Fulke woman is.

Id: [0x002B6845]
The traitor must have exited here with a few more, heading away … towards the riverbank.

Id: [0x002B6846]
The traitor must have exited here with a few more, heading away … towards the riverbank.

Id: [0x002B6848]
This fever will break once you know the whole truth. I promise.

Id: [0x002B684A]
Fine. Keep your dread secrets, Brother. But if this alliance fails, you may take them to your grave.

Id: [0x002B684B]
Fine. Keep your dread secrets, Brother. But if this alliance fails, you may take them to your grave.

Id: [0x002B684E]
When the time is right, I will.

Id: [0x002B684F]
She is the fulcrum of a larger plan.

Id: [0x002B6851]
Above conquering England? What larger plan could we need?

Id: [0x002B6852]
Above conquering England? What larger plan could we need?

Id: [0x002B6853]
I have a bad feeling … just the three of us … we should return to Nottfall with our report. While we can.

Id: [0x002B6854]
We can bring Kjotve news of the longships, or we can wake him with Sigurd Styrbjornsson's head. Which is better?

Id: [0x002B6855]
All right! When Ljot returns, we weigh our next move. But I am not one for sticking around, hear me?

Id: [0x002B6866]
One face, many faces. It matters not. We are all blessed to be alive in His glory.

Id: [0x002B686D]
They were alike once. The boy and Cynon. God-fearing Christians arguing the nature of life with me. But he softened.

Id: [0x002B6870]
I know not why, only that he gave them coin to dispose of Tewdwr. You can see how well they saw to that.

Id: [0x002B6871]
I know not why, only that he gave them coin to dispose of Tewdwr. You can see how well they saw to that.

Id: [0x002B6872]
An honorable thegn fighting a dishonorable war.

Id: [0x002B6874]
Why rob him of this last glory? A warrior ready to meet his god and bask in his praise. To live will only lead him to shame.

Id: [0x002B6875]
Burgred abandoned him, betrayed his trust. If I were Leofrith, I would want to know.

Id: [0x002B6876]
Burgred abandoned him, betrayed his trust. If I were Leofrith, I'd want to know.

Id: [0x002B6878]
It's not an oath he would keep if he knew the truth.

Id: [0x002B6879]
It's not an oath he would keep if he knew the truth.

Id: [0x002B687A]
Men do great evil to cling onto power, and save their skin. Perhaps he means to put Tewdwr to flame in his place?

Id: [0x002B6883]
Shame for shame. Not even his god will welcome him when I'm done.

Id: [0x002B6884]
Shame for shame. Not even his god will welcome him when I'm done.

Id: [0x002B6A1C]
Rollo…

Id: [0x002B6A1D]
Rollo…

Id: [0x002B6A20]
The way this war is unfolding, none will be alive to enjoy what little we have left.

Id: [0x002B6A29]
You think I mean to escape the flames? I go to the wicker man gladly.

Id: [0x002B6A2F]
A man must get his house in order before his death. Feather his nest for his children.

Id: [0x002B6A32]
Everything..? [realizing]You and Modron. Then … Gwynedd?

Id: [0x002B6A33]
Everything..? [realizing]You and Modron. Then … Gwynedd?

Id: [0x002B6A36]
I know. I never should have trusted Gwilim and his merry band of fuckwits to kill one man!

Id: [0x002B6A3D]
Our union conceived not only Gwenydd, but a united Glowecestrescire. [Cold fury]One that Tewdwr would stamp out.

Id: [0x002B6A4E]
This way.

Id: [0x002B6A50]
O, you know Svend! An old man with old ideas. Cannot stand the idea of living under a young king.

Id: [0x002B6A51]
I told him to let sleeping wolves lie, but he thinks he is doing our Styrbjorn a good turn. Defending his honor.

Id: [0x002B6A52]
Over there, beyond the gate.

Id: [0x002B6A55]
How did this happen?

Id: [0x002B6A56]
How did this happen?

Id: [0x002B6A59]
Stay here.

Id: [0x002B6A5A]
Stay here.

Id: [0x002B6A5D]
Eivor, look. Someone is setting up an outpost on that island.

Id: [0x002B6A64]
Nor did I. And not for lack of trying.

Id: [0x002B6A65]
Gunnar, you old trout … you're a married man. Never thought I would see the day.

Id: [0x002B6A66]
Gunnar, you old trout … you're a married man. Never thought I would see the day.

Id: [0x002B6A68]
(unintelligible)[Thank you, Eivor. I couldn't be happier to be here. I hope to know you better in the coming months and years.]

Id: [0x002B6A69]
Brigid. I gift you a formal welcome to our clan and our family. You are a fine addition to Gunnar's life and to ours.

Id: [0x002B6A6A]
Brigid. I gift you a formal welcome to our clan and our family. You are a fine addition to Gunnar's life and to ours.

Id: [0x002B6A6C]
Birstan. Estrid said you'd be here.

Id: [0x002B6A6D]
Birstan. Estrid said you'd be here.

Id: [0x002B6A6E]
A younger brother to me, yet more alike to a son. The things I should like to teach him!

Id: [0x002B6A6F]
It worries me, to be honest. Can I be both a brother to him and a love to his sister?

Id: [0x002B6A70]
What are your plans for Essexe and your family?

Id: [0x002B6A71]
What are your plans for Essexe and your family?

Id: [0x002B6A72]
And Eluric?

Id: [0x002B6A73]
And Eluric?

Id: [0x002B6A74]
Give him time, Birstan. He had his sister to himself all his life.

Id: [0x002B6A75]
Give him time, Birstan. He had his sister to himself all his life.

Id: [0x002B6A79]
Are you leering at me, lord?

Id: [0x002B6A7A]
Are you leering at me, lord?

Id: [0x002B6AFD]
A shield bearing the rune of Gungnir, exalted spear of Odin. May it guide this great man's aim.

Id: [0x002B6AFE]
A shield bearing the rune of Gungnir, exalted spear of Odin. May it guide this great man's aim.

Id: [0x002B6AFF]
Good. Get them marching at once. This must happen soon.

Id: [0x002B6B00]
As soon as they are mustered, Lord Faravid. And no sooner.

Id: [0x002B6B0E]
A shield bearing the sign of the Web of Wyrd, woven into this shield as you wove your spirit into our lives.

Id: [0x002B6B0F]
A shield bearing the sign of the Web of Wyrd, woven into this shield as you wove your spirit into our lives.

Id: [0x002B6B14]
May the sign of Vegvisir, the Rune of the Way, guide you to the hall of many doors.

Id: [0x002B6B15]
May the sign of Vegvisir, the Rune of the Way, guide you to the hall of many doors.

Id: [0x002B6B19]
Stand at my side.

Id: [0x002B6BA2]
You look … uneasy.

Id: [0x002B6BA3]
You look … uneasy.

Id: [0x002B6BA7]
And paralyzed by a thought … I stand between that man and jarldom.

Id: [0x002B6BB6]
You do your father proud by this celebration. And by taking his seat. He wanted this, Vili.

Id: [0x002B6BB7]
You do your father proud by this celebration. And by taking his seat. He wanted this, Vili.

Id: [0x002B6BB9]
I mourn for myself, Eivor. For us. You know my heart. It beats for the passion of battle-heat. Not … not this.

Id: [0x002B6BCD]
He knows my heart beats for battle and glory. Not … leadership and wise counsel.

Id: [0x002B6BD6]
A warrior rises with the dawn to follow fresh tracks in the new fallen powder. For that is where adventure lies.

Id: [0x002B6BD7]
You are your father's son. But you have never let yourself be the fullness of that man. Not until now.

Id: [0x002B6BD8]
You are your father's son. But you have never let yourself be the fullness of that man. Not until now.

Id: [0x002B6BDC]
As did your father's heart when he was our age. But he grew up. And so shall we.

Id: [0x002B6BDD]
As did your father's heart when he was our age. But he grew up. And so shall we.

Id: [0x002B6BE1]
Yes, yes. You're right. And certainly if you can lead, a Hemmingson can.

Id: [0x002B6BF2]
Sniff 'em out, boy! We'll paint the ground with their blood!

Id: [0x002B6C03]
Drunk as you are, I see before me a man full of passion, vigor, and a love for his people. I see a jarl.

Id: [0x002B6C04]
Drunk as you are, I see before me a man full of passion, vigor, and a love for his people. I see a jarl.

Id: [0x002B6C05]
For old times, then. And new alike.

Id: [0x002B6C06]
For old times, then. And new alike.

Id: [0x002B6C0F]
I will.

Id: [0x002B6C11]
Thieves who stole my war spoils.

Id: [0x002B6C2C]
Good. Now let them know, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002B6C2D]
Good. Now let them know, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002B6C33]
With Trygve by my side, with all of you, we will have glory.

Id: [0x002B6C3A]
What is this?

Id: [0x002B6C3B]
Old friend, you deserve this. And so much more. Be proud.

Id: [0x002B6C3D]
I … I do not know what to say.

Id: [0x002B6C41]
Until my path leads me home, I serve under your banner, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B6C43]
Well done, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002B6C44]
Well done, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002B6C52]
Eivor, let my first decree be Hemming's wish. An alliance between our people. When you call, we will rise.

Id: [0x002B6C58]
As we shall for you, Trygve Jarl.

Id: [0x002B6C59]
As we shall for you, Trygve Jarl.

Id: [0x002B6C64]
Who are these men you suspect of treason?

Id: [0x002B6C65]
Who are these men you suspect of treason?

Id: [0x002B6C6B]
My father never swore a formal oath with your clan. There was no need, for you are family.

Id: [0x002B6C77]
Hold on. We'll find a way through.

Id: [0x002B6C78]
Hold on. We'll find a way through.

Id: [0x002B6C7D]
A Dane, eh? Alright, pond scum, you'll deal with us now.

Id: [0x002B6C82]
Eivor! Something's there!

Id: [0x002B6C9D]
Traitors … thieves … no right! They had no right to … it's rightfully mine, yes, yes … Faravid the rat! Words are poison…[mumbling]

Id: [0x002B6CAB]
All right, Thegn Tedmund. Let's talk.

Id: [0x002B6CAC]
All right, Thegn Tedmund. Let's talk.

Id: [0x002B6CAE]
Was Halfdan always so easily riled?

Id: [0x002B6CAF]
Was Halfdan always so easily riled?

Id: [0x002B6CB3]
Snotingham … it'll be good to see Vili again.

Id: [0x002B6CB4]
Snotingham … it will be good to see Vili again.

Id: [0x002B6CB5]
No. Riches and glory have shaped him into something new. He's not the same man he used to be.

Id: [0x002B6CB6]
Make sure the supplies are secured. We may set off at any moment.

Id: [0x002B6CCA]
All is in order, then?

Id: [0x002B6CCB]
All is in order, then?

Id: [0x002B6CCE]
I don't like talk that dances around thorns.

Id: [0x002B6CCF]
I don't like talk that dances around thorns.

Id: [0x002B6CD0]
I fight for myself, and my people.

Id: [0x002B6CD1]
I fight for myself, and my people.

Id: [0x002B6CD2]
I am on your council, Ricsige, King of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002B6CD3]
I am on your council, Ricsige, King of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002B6CD4]
You know as well as I that we fight for Halfdan.

Id: [0x002B6CD5]
You know as well as I that we fight for Halfdan.

Id: [0x002B6CD8]
Why ask me of loyalty? What are you seeking?

Id: [0x002B6CD9]
Why ask me of loyalty? What are you seeking?

Id: [0x002B6CDA]
The rewards for being Tedmund are rapidly diminishing.

Id: [0x002B6CDC]
I am the seventh son of a poor farmer. And not wanting another mouth to feed, my father gave me to the monks.

Id: [0x002B6CDE]
I am not a good forgery. Stilted, leaden, my hands sweat, and I have a stutter when I am nervous. But I will try.

Id: [0x002B6CDF]
What took you from it?

Id: [0x002B6CE0]
What took you from it?

Id: [0x002B6CE4]
Let it sink. We have our lives and our strength. That alone will be enough for Hemming.

Id: [0x002B6CE5]
Let it sink. We have our lives and our strength. That alone will be enough for Hemming.

Id: [0x002B6CEA]
Let us approach the captain with caution. He drinks too much and does not need a reason to kill us.

Id: [0x002B6CF3]
I have orders to go to Stoneburgh, but our camp is just ahead, so hurry on without me. Vili and Hemming Jarl will be pleased to see you.

Id: [0x002B6D0D]
Enough bickering, all of you! We are at the edge of war. Preserve your rage for the enemy!

Id: [0x002B6D0F]
Ljufvina talks sense. We fight this battle and we end this war. At this moment, nothing else matters.

Id: [0x002B6D35]
Get back to work. Time is coin, and you're spending mine!

Id: [0x002B6D36]
Do you dare to question the orders of the great Thegn Tedmund? I will have you flogged!

Id: [0x002B6D3A]
Then choose. Truth … or glory.

Id: [0x002B6D48]
A Dane, saints preserve me!

Id: [0x002B6D57]
Eivor, you missed the opening act. Kjotve's forward camp melted like a spring thaw at our approach.

Id: [0x002B6D5C]
Who interferes with the king's business? Guards! Guards!

Id: [0x002B6D5D]
Quit bawling, you babe. They may be drunk, but they're not deaf.

Id: [0x002B6D6D]
Eivor! Help me destroy these barricades. Our men are on the other side!

Id: [0x002B6D99]
I've found him already! And as soon as he's married, we'll plunk his arse down on that throne.

Id: [0x002B6D9A]
Nothing welcomes us more into the day than a swift bruising!

Id: [0x002B6D9C]
You're a fool to challenge this one!

Id: [0x002B6D9D]
Even Beowulf never fought so well!

Id: [0x002B6D9E]
By all the saints and martyrs, Eivor. You are a beast!

Id: [0x002B6D9F]
We shall triumph, Eivor! We shall win this ugly row!

Id: [0x002B6DA0]
Is this what it means to be your friend?

Id: [0x002B6DA1]
Is this what it means to be your friend?

Id: [0x002B6DA2]
Because the man in question ain't been married yet. Once he is, East Anglia will have its king … and little else.

Id: [0x002B6DA3]
Which man?

Id: [0x002B6DA4]
Which man?

Id: [0x002B6DBB]
If he wants to live longer than a season, he'll need the backing of his bride's family. Which he hasn't! They loathe the maggot.

Id: [0x002B6DBD]
Who is he, your king maggot?

Id: [0x002B6DBE]
Who is he, your king maggot?

Id: [0x002B6DC4]
Yes, sorry. I'm just … shaken.

Id: [0x002B6DC5]
Show more grit than you're showing me now and they may start to like you.

Id: [0x002B6DC6]
Show more grit than you're showing me now and they may start to like you.

Id: [0x002B6DCB]
Quite a brutal outlook …

Id: [0x002B6DCC]
I am Oswald, yes. For as long as I can hold out.

Id: [0x002B6DD1]
Who else if not a king should bear it?

Id: [0x002B6DD2]
Who else if not a king should bear it?

Id: [0x002B6DD4]
God rest their poor souls. We must do something about this.

Id: [0x002B6DD5]
I'm needed at home to make yet another fruitless attempt to impress my betrothed's family over dinner.

Id: [0x002B6DD6]
And will I see you in the morning? We have much to discuss, I think.

Id: [0x002B6DD8]
I'll find a place to lay my head.

Id: [0x002B6DD9]
I'll find a place to lay my head.

Id: [0x002B6DDA]
Ah! Good morning. Up bright and early.

Id: [0x002B6DDC]
I fought ragged to the brink of death, from one night to the next. You saw the end of it. Wolves almost took me.

Id: [0x002B6DE7]
Aaaah!

Id: [0x002B6DF2]
Always push back with everything you have, even if you have to get dirty, even if you must break the rules.

Id: [0x002B6DF3]
Always push back with everything you have, even if you have to get dirty, even if you must break the rules.

Id: [0x002B6DF4]
Because there are no rules, not if you answer a challenge head-on. That's where honor lies.

Id: [0x002B6DF5]
Because there are no rules, not if you answer a challenge head-on. That's where honor lies.

Id: [0x002B6DFA]
A man will lie to save his skin. When you are gone, he'll gut me and burn my people. The gods showed me this.

Id: [0x002B6DFC]
Cynon spoke of your vision. The Nornir spin their fatal threads, but without your plan, his heart would remain unchanged.

Id: [0x002B6DFD]
Cynon spoke of your vision. The Nornir spin their fatal threads, but without your plan, his heart would remain unchanged.

Id: [0x002B6E0C]
There's a crate of hacksilver here. More than enough to make everyone happy.

Id: [0x002B6E10]
A hard won fight.

Id: [0x002B6E14]
We'll take it to the ship.

Id: [0x002B6E15]
We'll take it to the ship.

Id: [0x002B6E17]
Bishop.

Id: [0x002B6E18]
Bishop.

Id: [0x002B6E22]
Your wounds should heal by the next moon, if you get some rest.

Id: [0x002B6E23]
Then you have my thanks, Mother Modron!

Lovely woman, utterly terrifying though. Let's return with haste. This cave is a place of nightmares.

Cynon is dead for your lies. Your wicker man will burn empty.

Id: [0x002B6E39]
Cynon is dead for your lies. Your wicker man will burn empty.

Id: [0x002B6E3E]
This is my gift to the brothers.

Id: [0x002B6E40]
I have more than enough wealth in Elmenham to widen their eyes. But this will be a symbol of my commitment to our fight.

Id: [0x002B6E42]
It's a good start.

Id: [0x002B6E43]
It's a good start.

Id: [0x002B6E55]
Cynon and Modron conspired to bring about your end. Now, both lie dead by my hand.

Id: [0x002B6E56]
Cynon and Modron conspired to bring about your end. Now, both lie dead by my hand.

Id: [0x002B6E59]
I killed Modron, but Cynon lives to burn in the wicker man.

Id: [0x002B6E5A]
I killed Modron, but Cynon lives to burn in the wicker man.

Id: [0x002B6E5B]
Such a waste of life. The devil whispers into the ear of man. But we must ignore his voice.

Id: [0x002B6E60]
You shall have your revenge at last, Eivor! We sail forward into the fire!

Id: [0x002B6E62]
I did! There was a girl once. Golden hair, firm round rump, arms like coils of rope. She haunted my dreams.

Id: [0x002B6E64]
She married my brother and they both died during a spring raid. He had a pretty face, but his sword skills were weak.

Id: [0x002B6E68]
What happened to her?

Id: [0x002B6E69]
What happened to her?

Id: [0x002B6E70]
That won't make you any friends here.

Id: [0x002B6E79]
And if he prevails and unites the clans?

Id: [0x002B6E7A]
And if he prevails and unites the clans?

Id: [0x002B6E84]
My clan throws the best feasts, I think you'll find. You enjoy yourself?

Id: [0x002B6E8A]
I did. But were you celebrating or mourning? You looked unsure.

Id: [0x002B6E8B]
I did. But were you celebrating or mourning? You looked unsure.

Id: [0x002B6E92]
I bleedin' love a good toss-around. Gives me life!

Id: [0x002B6E93]
I'll vomit on you, Dane! Won't think twice about it!

Id: [0x002B6E95]
No. Boy is likely cowering in a haystack somewhere.

Id: [0x002B6E97]
Any sign of Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002B6E98]
Any sign of Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002B6E99]
Keep an eye out.

Id: [0x002B6E9A]
Keep an eye out.

Id: [0x002B6E9C]
No, but we caught sight of Leofrith fleeing across the river. He was chasing someone.

Id: [0x002B6E9E]
Have you seen Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002B6E9F]
Have you seen Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002B6EA6]
Don't hold to hope. Few could survive such a fall.

Id: [0x002B6EA7]
Do not hold to hope. Few could survive such a fall.

Id: [0x002B6EAB]
They will die by my hand. No pain, no public humiliation.

Id: [0x002B6EAE]
Only I will bear the burden of causing their death. It will not muddy the minds of any other. That is enough.

Id: [0x002B6EAF]
If I can find your traitor, what will you do with them?

Id: [0x002B6EB0]
If I can find your traitor, what will you do with them?

Id: [0x002B6EB4]
Soma. To understand your people well, I should better know you.

Id: [0x002B6EB5]
Soma. To understand your people well, I should better know you.

Id: [0x002B6EB7]
Good luck, Eivor. Thank you for doing this.

Id: [0x002B6EB8]
That's all.

Id: [0x002B6EB9]
That's all.

Id: [0x002B6EBB]
How did you rise to the rank of jarlskona?

Id: [0x002B6EBC]
How did you rise to the rank of jarlskona?

Id: [0x002B6EBE]
Why do you love Grantebridge so deeply?

Id: [0x002B6EBF]
Why do you love Grantebridge so deeply?

Id: [0x002B6EC0]
My king, Guthrum, led the Summer Army through this land. When he marched into Wessex, I volunteered to defend the city.

Id: [0x002B6EC2]
So I grew the city up from very little and fell in love with her. It was a dagger to the heart to lose it, and a balm to have it back.

Id: [0x002B6EC3]
I was orphaned young, but old enough to remember it. I feel I've been reaching for a family all my life.

Id: [0x002B6EC5]
(snort)

Id: [0x002B6EC8]
Grantebridge is more than some silver boon. She's a place for me to build that family, for anyone who needs one.

Id: [0x002B6ED4]
Oil jars, springald arrows, fodder and the like. Take what's useful and burn the rest.

Id: [0x002B6ED6]
But these warriors are more than a blade and shield. They are my family. Nothing short. I've lost a city this week. I will not lose them too.

Id: [0x002B6ED7]
Oi! Stay down! They're close!

Id: [0x002B6F0A]
The hazel is laid! The square is made!

Id: [0x002B6F10]
Whenever you're ready, king of sheep shit!

Id: [0x002B6F12]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x002B6F19]
Call me king before I gut you!

Id: [0x002B6F1D]
Fighting dirty, are you?

Id: [0x002B6F1F]
King Rued commands you to die!

Id: [0x002B6F22]
Call me king!

Id: [0x002B6FB7]
Lords, Ladies. This is a day of peace and fraternity. I asked you here to Elmenham to offer my thanks and extend my generosity.

Id: [0x002B6FBF]
Is that why you've come? To back this thegn (nobleman) who smells of goat shit and sheep pebbles?

Id: [0x002B6FC1]
You'd be safer crowning the throne. It's made of less wood than this one!

Id: [0x002B6FC3]
You watch your tongue, Wolf-Kissed. Or you'll find it freed of your face!

Id: [0x002B6FC6]
O! Please, stop this.

Id: [0x002B6FC9]
That's it!

Id: [0x002B6FCE]
You get to plow our sister because Halfdan commands it. But you won't drag us into bed with you, you hear?

Id: [0x002B6FCF]
Broder, that is--

Id: [0x002B6FD0]
The last Saxon king we backed wasn't half as mushy as you. And we lost a hundred and fifty men protecting his maggoty arse!

Id: [0x002B6FD3]
If you're going to be rude, then I must ask you to leave. This is my home, and I won't be insulted here.

Id: [0x002B6FDC]
I'm here to protect my clan. If that means helping your king secure his throne, well, so be it.

Id: [0x002B6FDD]
I'm here to protect my clan. If that means helping your king secure his throne, well, so be it.

Id: [0x002B6FDE]
We'd all be safer if you had the stones to stand up to Rued's clan.

Id: [0x002B6FDF]
We'd all be safer if you had the stones to stand up to Rued's clan.

Id: [0x002B6FE0]
So easily wounded by words. Imagine the ruin my axe would inflict on your flaccid ego.

Between the pair of you, I can't see a single nugget.

But between the pair of you, I can't see a single nugget.

The Romans built that wall to keep us out. But they are gone, and we remain.

Id: [0x002B6FFB]
Turn tail and run, back beyond the wall.

Id: [0x002B6FFC]
Turn tail and run, back beyond the wall.

Id: [0x002B6FFE]
Wall or no wall, we have more gods than you.

Id: [0x002B7000]
We may have but one God, heathen, but we have many more friends.

Id: [0x002B7005]
Who now is the rightful king of Northumbria?

Id: [0x002B7007]
The kingdom has spoken!

Id: [0x002B7010]
Are they gone? Thank the light!

Id: [0x002B7024]
Ah! [laugh]I knew this was not my day to die.

Id: [0x002B7025]
Ahh… I won't be pushed around by some shit-eating outsiders.

Id: [0x002B7027]
Quiet, Svend. Your body is much older than your mouth realizes.

Id: [0x002B7028]
Quiet, Svend. Your body is much older than your mouth realizes.

Id: [0x002B7043]
That chance has passed. Look.

Id: [0x002B7044]
King Harald's banner.

Id: [0x002B704E]
Thank the gods!

Id: [0x002B7050]
The Picts cower. Muster the men for battle.

Id: [0x002B7060]
Faravid should be waiting at Stenwege.

The ceremony hastens to start, let's not keep the crowd waiting.

Id: [0x002B7079]
The ceremony hastens to start, let's not keep the crowd waiting.

Id: [0x002B707C]
Eivor. Yes, let us go. To inscribe our names in history.

Id: [0x002B7089]
Eivor, welcome. Halfdan has stepped outside with Faravid. They shouldn't be far.

Id: [0x002B708A]
To Eivor and the Raven Clan of Mercia, our newest ally, in blood and glory!

Id: [0x002B70A3]
This land of summer, mist, and forests dreaming darkly. I see secrets, and I want to know England. All of it.

Id: [0x002B70A8]
Another man, who played the caliphate's game better took the credit. He was exiled and died in poverty.

Id: [0x002B70A9]
Perhaps the stars write your path, and you will never have a home here.

Id: [0x002B70AD]
If Aelfred's emissary spent a few days here. Someone may know where he went.

Id: [0x002B70AE]
If Aelfred's emissary spent a few days here. Someone may know where he went.

Id: [0x002B70BB]
There are some who are worthy, a scant few that tower above the sullied mass. Men and women of vision and valor.

Id: [0x002B70BC]
Your faith sours. What of loyalty, shared stories round the hearth? Warm nights, bodies, and the tender love of another?

Id: [0x002B70BD]
Your faith sours. What of loyalty, shared stories round the hearth? Warm nights, bodies, and the tender love of another?

He is. Fulke isn't wrong on that score.

Id: [0x002B70C3]
Sigurd is one such man?

Id: [0x002B70C4]
Sigurd is one such man?

Id: [0x002B70C5]
I fear for him, Basim. I cannot rest until he is free.

Id: [0x002B70C6]
I fear for him, Basim. I cannot rest until he is safe.

Id: [0x002B70DB]
Nor will I, my friend.

Id: [0x002B70F3]
An advisor, nothing more, here to help Essexe navigate her brewing storms.

Id: [0x002B70F4]
Who is this owl, Birstan, that twitters in your ear?

Id: [0x002B70F5]
And you, Wyatt? What do you say?

Id: [0x002B712E]
I … ah … bosoms that? … ah, no. I'm afraid I don't know what that means, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B7140]
I sense you had some fun there, Eivor. And your playful wickedness backfooted my squabbling thegns.

Id: [0x002B7142]
I don't know what you speak of, lord.

Id: [0x002B7143]
I don't know what you speak of, lord.

Id: [0x002B714B]
Explain yourselves, clear and plain, and I will do it. The poetry here is mind mud.

Hm. Surely Hytham sounds like me … if I have taught him well.

You know, for the first time since we've met, you sound more like your apprentice than yourself.

You have been away too long, Brother. You do not know the spiced kick of Tekla's mead.

Id: [0x002B7171]
You have been away too long, Brother. You do not know the spiced kick of Tekla's mead.

Id: [0x002B7173]
From drinking to breathing, you turn everything into a competition, Brother. I must always be prepared.

Id: [0x002B7175]
Nothing is safe till they are away to Francia.

Id: [0x002B717D]
Yes, I have missed this terribly.

Id: [0x002B717F]
When I first met Basim, I regaled him with tales of our homeland. And it was then I felt a hard longing to return at once.

Id: [0x002B7182]
Come.

Id: [0x002B7184]
This brings us to your gift.

Id: [0x002B71B0]
These excellent men were my shepherds through much of their homeland, the Abbasid Caliphate.

Id: [0x002B71E0]
Ah, the cornerstone of all great art.

Id: [0x002B71E4]
Birna thinks of life as a grand joke. She was a smuggler when Soma pulled her from the muck, making a living on lies.

Id: [0x002B71E5]
Birna is part of my clan, and I will fight beside her, irreverent as she is. But she has no care for her destiny.

Id: [0x002B7214]
Who dares enter this sanctuary?

Id: [0x002B723C]
Brothir!

Id: [0x002B723E]
My flaccid what?

Id: [0x002B7242]
Stay out of this, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002B7246]
Right. I'll start looking for a new king tomorrow. It was good to know you, lord.

Id: [0x002B7247]
If I'm to be a worthy king, I must meet the man who bedevils us. I'll light the brazier at Dunwic and face him when he comes.

Id: [0x002B7252]
That is … quite lovely.

Id: [0x002B7253]
Do not gorge on grief, nor give in to sadness, but let your aching love light the mead of your eyes and lead you to triumph.

Id: [0x002B725C]
You … point me to the bishop. No one else need die today.

Id: [0x002B7267]
I wouldn't say that. It's more … Birna's boots are stuck in the mud. And Galinn's are in the sky.

Id: [0x002B727D]
The king has called for his best mead, so the talks are concluded. It should be safe to enter.

Id: [0x002B72A9]
Rhodri waits at the church nearby.

Id: [0x002B72AB]
Who speaks for Sciropescire in these talks?

Id: [0x002B72AC]

I do not regret the lives lost for the charity gained.

Id: [0x002B72B0]
Now we are ruled by Christ-beaten bastards.

Id: [0x002B72B7]
We are both a clot and cancer. We sit heavy in water, and yet we spread like a river's current.

Id: [0x002B72B9]
You'll get yours, bloody heathen.

Id: [0x002B72BB]
Wait for my signal.

Id: [0x002B72C4]
I only wished to be a freebooter. Someone who writes their own destiny.

Id: [0x002B72D0]
Let us all raise our cups. A toast to our new ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B72D3]
Let us all raise our cups. A toast to our new ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B72D6]
Nowhere in particular. I only want to celebrate.

Id: [0x002B72D7]
Where to?

Id: [0x002B72D8]
Where to?

Id: [0x002B72D9]
You there … get lost.

Id: [0x002B72E2]
He will piss his pants first thing, that's for certain.

Id: [0x002B72E3]
I find the idea of leading a shire on my own quite … quite terrifying.

Id: [0x002B72E5]
My father thinks me fit already. I shouldn't want to disappoint him.

Id: [0x002B72EC]
It's not far, just across the village.

Id: [0x002B731C]
No more pulling strings. This throne and its burdens are mine.

Id: [0x002B7324]
I defer to your expertise. Hacking, hewing, and the like. Enjoy the feast, counselor.

Id: [0x002B739A]
Is that more Frankish wine? I'll take a few casks, and that silver there.

Id: [0x002B739B]
Ulf … that's Halfdan's share.

Id: [0x002B73A4]
Shame there is no Saxon blood left for us to spill.

Id: [0x002B73A5]
Let's give the ravens a feast of Saxon blood!

Id: [0x002B73AB]
Today is not a good day to be the thegn.

Id: [0x002B73AE]
The fella was right to be paranoid. Must be going quite mad by now.

Id: [0x002B73AF]
I'm telling you, it's Danes. They won't rest till they butcher the last of us.

Id: [0x002B73B3]
I need to clear this fort and break this chain to get our ships safely upriver. The mechanism should be inside.

Id: [0x002B73C1]
Everyone all right?

Id: [0x002B73C7]
You've done it! We must hurry.

Id: [0x002B73CB]
With the chain down, Geadric and the ships can get through.

Id: [0x002B73CC]
With the chain down, Geadric and the ships can get through.

Id: [0x002B73E5]
I will not. I've come to see you safely home. Now get up.

Id: [0x002B73E6]
I will not. I've come to see you safely home. Now get up.

Id: [0x002B73E7]
Hurry it up, get the ship ready!

Id: [0x002B73E9]
I should wait for Basim. Only death and darkness follow if I go in alone.

Id: [0x002B73EA]

Knud? What are you doing in here?

Id: [0x002B73F3]
Knud? What are you doing in here?

Id: [0x002B73FF]
The king's brother is--

Id: [0x002B7401]
The king's brother is a moldering sack of cow dung.

Id: [0x002B7402]
You. I know your face, your stench. Ivarr … the one they call Boneless. Did I not gift you that scar myself?

Id: [0x002B7403]
Ah! You did, and I mean to gift you a gash, you reeking piss pot. In your fat fucking skull!

Id: [0x002B7417]
A blind pursuit of vengeance has made you predictable.

Id: [0x002B741A]
We are grateful to Sigurd for his invitation, and eager to pay tribute to your king.

Id: [0x002B7422]
Both had reason to betray their jarl. But only one had the ice-heart to do so.

Id: [0x002B7425]
Eivor, stop. And listen. You have reclaimed your honor. Enjoy the night's victory, tomorrow we will celebrate.

Id: [0x002B7426]
We have won the day, but Gorm escaped. He fled north, to King Harald's domain.

You dare to take this fortress, Dane? Aelfred's army will smear your innards across the battlements.

Id: [0x002B742F]
I shit on you! You and your toy gods! I will not bow to you like some puppet lord. I would rather die.

Id: [0x002B7439]
We are not here for stone and sand, Thegn Tedmund.

We could talk all day. But these Saxons may fly from their nest.

Captain Ynyr! Explain to the good bishop our position.

Id: [0x002B744C]
Husband! No!

Id: [0x002B744D]
In my time with them, they shared many of their most hidden secrets. For which I am grateful. And now…

Id: [0x002B7450]
They are a clan not joined by blood, but by a common idea. A brotherhood of shadows executing their own form of justice.

Id: [0x002B7452]
I will soon help you fall on yours.

Id: [0x002B7453]
Hold! Both of you!

Hold! Both of you!

Too right, too right. Wigmund's whelp awaits his reward.

Id: [0x002B7487]
How are you faring after losing Lif?

Id: [0x002B7488]
How are you faring after losing Lif?

Id: [0x002B7489]
How are you after losing Birna?

Id: [0x002B748A]
How are you after losing Birna?

Id: [0x002B748B]
It was good to see you, Soma.

Id: [0x002B748C]
It was good to see you, Soma.

Id: [0x002B7492]
Lif, how are you faring?

Id: [0x002B7493]
Lif, how are you faring?

Id: [0x002B7495]
Birna, how are you?

Id: [0x002B7496]
Birna, how are you?

Id: [0x002B7497]
I fought my entire life for her. She taught me what integrity means and made me the man I am. In this place, she will live on.

Id: [0x002B7499]
I'm sorry about Soma, Birna.

Id: [0x002B749A]
I'm sorry about Soma, Birna.

Id: [0x002B74A9]
That doesn't count! You need silver! And jewels!

Id: [0x002B74AA]
I returned with a boat and a full crew. That is worth more than silver.

Id: [0x002B74AB]
I returned with a boat and a full crew. That is worth more than silver.

Id: [0x002B74B1]
I see her face in my dreams, looking up at me from the floor with such sadness, such love. I miss her terribly.

Id: [0x002B74B2]
It is quiet without Lif. I took his fervor for sailing and life for granted. He was honest to the end. I miss him.

Id: [0x002B74B5]
How's Grantebridge? It's gone through so many changes.

Id: [0x002B74B6]
How's Grantebridge? It's gone through so many changes.

Id: [0x002B74B8]
Hello again.

Id: [0x002B74B9]
Hello again.

Id: [0x002B74C4]
Hello.

Id: [0x002B74C7]
Eivor, my friend. It's good to see you again.

Id: [0x002B74D6]
But I have Birna. It's a blessing for which I have the gods to thank.

Id: [0x002B74D9]
The city has bounced back quickly. The river brings trade, and trade brings prosperity.

Id: [0x002B74DA]
I've built this city into something separate from myself. As long as I protect it for the rest of my days, it will live on and on.

Id: [0x002B74DD]
Recovered, thank you! And with some beautiful scars to show it.

Id: [0x002B74DE]
It's colder here, without Birna. Yet she lives on in every bawdy joke, pinched rump, and quaffed tankard in every feast.

Id: [0x002B74DF]
I do all I can to convince Soma that Birna's death was not her fault. One day she may believe me.

Id: [0x002B74E0]
Walking, talking, and sporting a VERY flattering scar. Shapely, even.

Id: [0x002B74E1]
I do miss Lif. Only after he's left this world, do I fully appreciate how much the man was the majority of my impulse control.

Id: [0x002B74E2]
It's me and Soma, free to do as we please, as long as we can. As I've always wanted! I only wish Lif didn't have to die.

Id: [0x002B74E6]
Rhodri's Britons will strike back long before we can.

Id: [0x002B74E7]
Rhodri's Britons will strike back long before we can.

Id: [0x002B74E8]
You did yourself proud, aetheling.

Id: [0x002B74ED]
I'm sorry about Soma, Lif. Grantebridge must feel empty without her.

Id: [0x002B74EE]
I'm sorry about Soma, Lif. Grantebridge must feel empty without her.

Id: [0x002B74EF]
Well done, drengr (courageous warrior).

Id: [0x002B74F0]
As am I. She lived so much for other people, for the greater good. Gods, I wish she'd thought of herself this time. Or of me.

Id: [0x002B74F5]
Where are you, Cynon?

Id: [0x002B74F6]
Where are you, Cynon?

Id: [0x002B7500]
Are we?

Id: [0x002B750C]
That message led us here, to this place. To a Norse grave in North America.

Id: [0x002B750E]
Is it Halfdan? Has he gotten worse?

Id: [0x002B750F]
Is it Halfdan? Has he gotten worse?

Id: [0x002B7514]
I could speak with him. Where is he now?

Id: [0x002B7515]
I could speak with him. Where is he now?

Id: [0x002B7516]
I'll find him. Thank you Moira.

Id: [0x002B7517]
I'll find him. Thank you Moira.

Id: [0x002B7519]
That pulse in the message. Are you sure it's just coordinates? Nothing else?

Id: [0x002B751A]
Nothing I can find.

Id: [0x002B751D]
Here we go.

Id: [0x002B7523]
And the anomalies, is she talking to you there?

Id: [0x002B7524]
No, these sound like … like overheard conversations. They don't seem to know I'm listening. Or they don't care.

Id: [0x002B7525]
Hm. I uploaded the data you found to our server. I'll have a closer listen when I have time.

Id: [0x002B7526]
Good idea.

Id: [0x002B7527]
(snoring)

Id: [0x002B7537]
Yes, we did! How good of you to come. The food's not fully prepared, however. Return after night falls and we'll have a rousing good feast, hm?

Id: [0x002B7538]
Oswald. We spoke of a dinner earlier.

Id: [0x002B7539]
Oswald. We spoke of a dinner earlier.

Id: [0x002B7542]
It's worse here than I feared.

Id: [0x002B7543]
It's worse here than I feared.

Id: [0x002B7544]
Ridiculous! Absurd!

Id: [0x002B7545]
This is not how we settle disputes in East Anglia!

Id: [0x002B7548]
The situation in East Anglia is worse than I feared.

Id: [0x002B7549]
The situation in East Anglia is worse than I feared.

Id: [0x002B754A]
Calm yourselves!

Id: [0x002B755B]
This is no way to ensure I'll be queen!

Id: [0x002B755C]
Brothers! Stop this! Or I'll have both your arses!

Id: [0x002B7570]
Ha! Reminds of home, those bygone days.

Id: [0x002B7571]
Ah! To be so full of vigor again!

Id: [0x002B7573]
I hope so. I just need to prepare. I'll meet you at the islet.

Id: [0x002B7574]
Ah! Was that too hard?

Id: [0x002B7576]
Hard to believe this one will marry Valdis, don't you think?

Id: [0x002B7577]
Come now! Inspire us, king!

Id: [0x002B757E]
Finish this, Eivor. It pains me to watch!

Id: [0x002B75CC]
Eivor, I expect your longship crew could help with this attack.

Id: [0x002B75CE]
Over here!

Id: [0x002B75E0]
About the challenge I'd expect from a friend of Oswald.

Id: [0x002B75E1]
If that's all you've got, it's little wonder East Anglia's in the state it is.

Id: [0x002B75E2]
If that's all you've got, it's little wonder East Anglia's in the state it is.

Id: [0x002B75E6]
I see East Anglia's future right here. Right now. In all of you, Dane and Saxon alike. To our future!

Id: [0x002B75E9]
I thought you weak, bendable, without resolve. But not all men are as they first appear.

Id: [0x002B75EA]
I thought you weak, bendable, without resolve. But not all men are as they first appear.

Id: [0x002B75EB]
All qualities of a man worthy to be king. He is the king East Anglia deserves, and the king you need. To the good King Oswald!

Id: [0x002B75EC]
All qualities of a man worthy to be king. He is the king East Anglia deserves, and the king you need. To the good King Oswald!

Under his protection, under his guidance, under his wing, the good King Oswald will keep you safe for many moons to come.

Id: [0x002B75EF]

Prepare the square and we'll meet you there.

Id: [0x002B75F7]
Prepare the square and we'll meet you there.

Id: [0x002B75F8]
I hope you're ready.

Id: [0x002B75F9]
I hope you're ready.

Id: [0x002B75FB]
If I could steal the letter without killing the emissary, it would keep me out of trouble.

Id: [0x002B75FC]
If I could steal the letter without killing the emissary, it would keep me out of trouble.

Id: [0x002B7604]
Are you ready for the holmgang?

Id: [0x002B7605]
Are you ready for the holmgang?

Id: [0x002B7609]
It was a good strike. Keep going.

Id: [0x002B760A]
It was a good strike. Keep going.

Id: [0x002B760E]
I'm still here.

Id: [0x002B760F]
You felt that one.

Id: [0x002B7610]
You felt that one.

Id: [0x002B7614]
I've been in East Anglia many summers now, but I'll always be a Dane.

Id: [0x002B7615]
You've still got the touch for drawing a square.

Id: [0x002B7616]
You've still got the touch for drawing a square.

Id: [0x002B7618]
Must we do this, Eivor?

Id: [0x002B7632]
Oswald of Elmenham. You may be a king to us Danes yet.

Id: [0x002B7635]
I hope you chose well, for you denied them a seat in my hall.

Id: [0x002B7638]
Eivor is the victor. But you've shown us something, Oswald.

Id: [0x002B7643]
Did you see that sobbing sack of meat with the roosters?

Id: [0x002B765C]
Find something?

Id: [0x002B765D]
Find something?

Id: [0x002B7663]
He's fleeing to the north!

Id: [0x002B766D]
She was always a jealous crow, beak-pricking over every decision I made.

Id: [0x002B76A2]
See what you can find. I'll go back to the brothers.

Id: [0x002B76AF]
Here's King Aelfred's decree. A man named Tedmund is the chosen ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B76B0]
Here's King Aelfred's decree. A man named Tedmund is the chosen ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B76D0]
Unpacking it now. Standby.

Id: [0x002B76E1]
You mind if I put some music on?

Id: [0x002B76E2]
Go for it.

Id: [0x002B76E3]
Cool.

Id: [0x002B76E4]
Shaun, don't forget to water the plants while I'm under, okay?

Id: [0x002B76E5]
I'll add it to the calendar. And tattoo it on my leg.

Id: [0x002B76EE]
They will skewer us like suckling pigs!

Id: [0x002B76EF]
They will skewer us like suckling pigs!

Id: [0x002B76F7]
Watch out!

Id: [0x002B76FA]
Damn. Someone won't be happy.

Id: [0x002B770B]
Yeah, I won't remember that.

Id: [0x002B770C]
Dammit, I forgot about these…

Id: [0x002B7763]
Ah, yes, I did. Observe…!

Id: [0x002B7765]
This fine specimen belonged to our beloved ealdorman, Hundbeorht, before his untimely passing.

Id: [0x002B7766]
He left it here when we last hunted together. I now wish you to have it.

Id: [0x002B7767]
You said you had something to show me when we last spoke. What did you mean?

Id: [0x002B7768]
You said you had something to show me when we last spoke. What did you mean?

Id: [0x002B776B]
I thought you might like it!

Id: [0x002B776C]
It's a beautiful weapon. Finely crafted. Thank you.

Id: [0x002B776D]
It's a beautiful weapon. Finely crafted. Thank you.

Id: [0x002B7770]
Bribe you? Heavens no! This is a simple gift of thanks. For solving the mystery of Hundbeorht's disappearance.

Id: [0x002B7771]
This has the feeling of a bribe, Aelfgar. Are you trying to win my favor for some reason?

Id: [0x002B7772]
This has the feeling of a bribe, Aelfgar. Are you trying to win my favor for some reason?

Id: [0x002B7775]
I suppose so. But I thought you a more fitting recipient. You'd know how to use it.

Id: [0x002B7776]
If this belonged to the ealdorman, shouldn't it go to Hunwald next?

Id: [0x002B7777]
If this belonged to the ealdorman, shouldn't it go to Hunwald next?

Id: [0x002B7778]
All men and women, noble or peasant, have within them the seeds of something greater.

Id: [0x002B7779]
So to fight her, you've pledged your sword to a minor thegn who likely commands a gang of farmers and fishermen.

Id: [0x002B777A]

Id: [0x002B777C]
Hmm. I'm not sure. They often went hunting together, so it's not strange that he should have something of my father's.

Id: [0x002B777E]
No, no. You're better suited to such gifts. I'm a talker, not a fighter.

Id: [0x002B777F]
Before I let it pass, Hunwald. I spoke with Aelfgar before this. He gifted me a weapon of your father's. Should I find that odd?

Id: [0x002B7780]
Before I let it pass, Hunwald. I spoke with Aelfgar before this. He gifted me a weapon of your father's. Should I find that odd?

You don't want it yourself? As a memento mori?

You don't want it yourself? As a memento mori?

Id: [0x002B7786]
Love for one's child is a virtue, but wrath is a sin. How can one entangle with the other?

Id: [0x002B7788]
Modron had a vision of you wiping out the pagans. And Gwenydd is Cynon's bastard, so he simply did it to protect his kin.

Id: [0x002B7793]
Thank you, Eivor. As a gift, I could design a new tattoo for you. Something to decorate your scar.

Id: [0x002B7794]
See? All in the eye.

Id: [0x002B7795]
See? All in the eye.

Id: [0x002B7796]
Away, beast! Away! You won't trouble me any longer!

Id: [0x002B7798]
Aelfgar, careful!

Id: [0x002B7799]
Aelfgar, careful!

Id: [0x002B779A]
O! You've come back.

Id: [0x002B779D]
Thank you, Eivor. Now, I have something for you.

Id: [0x002B7B7C]
I'll see that she's cared for. She has no guilt in this.

Id: [0x002B7B7D]
I will not join your Church of Christ.

Id: [0x002B7B7F]
You won't have to.

Id: [0x002B7B84]
Now, what of the witchling?

Id: [0x002B7B85]
Now, what of the witchling?

Id: [0x002B7B9F]
He'll come around in time, but keep him from Ivarr if you can. He's the furthest thing from a mentor.

Id: [0x002B7BA0]
He'll come around in time, but keep him from Ivarr if you can. He's the furthest thing from a mentor.

Id: [0x002B7BA1]
You're the traitor, Eadwyn! Calling on Aelfred of Wessex, begging for his army!

Id: [0x002B7BA4]
And what of the holy woman, Fulke? You promised us a meeting with her.

Id: [0x002B7BA9]
I did, aye. But it's a fair mystery why you'd want to talk with--

Id: [0x002B7BAA]
Where is she?

Id: [0x002B7BAB]
Thegn Holt will know. Fulke lives on his lands. But he'll be dead with the rest, if you don't stop the trial.

Id: [0x002B7BAC]
Tell us where and we'll go now. Their lives depend on the speed of your tongue.

Id: [0x002B7BB9]
Lord in his mercy. What sorcery happened here?

Id: [0x002B7BC7]
Fine. Come back anytime.

Id: [0x002B7BC8]
Welcome back, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002B7BCE]
That is all I need for now.

Id: [0x002B7BCF]
That's all I need for now.

Id: [0x002B7BDF]
(snoring)

Id: [0x002B7BE1]
And you'd be right.

Id: [0x002B7BE2]
Are you always this cagey?

Id: [0x002B7BE3]
Almost never. I've emailed you a list of things I'd like you to investigate. The mutual intelligibility of Old Norse and Old English is a big one.

Id: [0x002B7BE4]
Good question. Eivor seems to be doing fine, but I'll pay more attention.

Id: [0x002B7BE5]
Oh, and King Aelfred, the only English king to be called Great. Get a good look at his face, alright? I'd be nice to know if his statue in Winchester is entirely accurate.

Id: [0x002B7BE6]
I'll lean in real close, just for you.

Id: [0x002B7BE7]
Tend the wounded. We'll get them out.

Id: [0x002B7BE8]
Tend the wounded. We'll get them out.

Id: [0x002B7BEC]
Look there, Stoneburgh is afire! My father sent Trygve there to fortify its defenses!

Id: [0x002B7C10]
How will you remember him?

Id: [0x002B7C17]
There. Looks like one of Rued's men.

Id: [0x002B7C18]
There. Looks like one of Rued's men.

Id: [0x002B7C19]
Elmenham will not recover. None of us will.

Id: [0x002B7C1B]
Ah. Gungnir, then. Odin's faultless spear. A symbol of power.

Id: [0x002B7C1E]
The Web of Wyrd then. Nine lines that write our fates. Past, present, and future entwined.

Id: [0x002B7C28]
The Mark of Vegvisir. Sights never lost.

Id: [0x002B7C2A]
By his determination to keep his clan safe and his people celebrated.

Id: [0x002B7C2B]
By his determination to keep his clan safe and his people celebrated.

Id: [0x002B7C38]
That's silver, livestock, and a trophy from our slain enemy. What more do you want?

Id: [0x002B7C39]
Who said we wanted anything, Saxon?

Id: [0x002B7C56]
We'll be there, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B7C58]
Eivor, you made it.

Id: [0x002B7C5F]
To see you both together again, like this. It recalls days long past. Makes me feel … young again.

Id: [0x002B7C62]
You've become a great warrior, Eivor. A warrior and a leader, worth song and verse.

Id: [0x002B7C63]
The seer is on her way, Father. She has remedies for you. Cures and charms.

Id: [0x002B7C64]
Hold on to that feeling. And take it with you to the hall of the slain.

Id: [0x002B7C65]
Hold on to that feeling. And take it with you to the hall of the slain.

Id: [0x002B7C70]
I … I am proud of what you have become, Son.

Id: [0x002B7C74]
It is time to light the brazier.

Id: [0x002B7C76]
Brothir, Valdis, and I will scout the dock, make sure there are no surprises.

Id: [0x002B7C77]
Oswald and I will hold here until the brazier is lit.

Id: [0x002B7C78]
I'll light it. You do the talking.

Id: [0x002B7C79]
I'll light it. You do the talking.

Id: [0x002B7C89]
You don't speak for us, steward.

Id: [0x002B7C8A]
Need I remind you wags what Halfdan will do with us if East Anglia falls into Rued's hands?

Id: [0x002B7C8B]
I'm sure you're heading to Dunwic any moment.

Id: [0x002B7C8C]
I'm sure you're heading to Dunwic any moment.

Id: [0x002B7CA4]
It's the only way. We must face him head on, and we cannot waiver.

Id: [0x002B7CA5]
Come Oswald, we make for Dunwic.

Id: [0x002B7CAB]
And, of course, I will see the lot of you there as well, else the songs of your cowardice will ring out over the generations.

Id: [0x002B7CAC]
And, of course, I will see the lot of you there as well, else the songs of your cowardice will ring out over the generations.

Thank you for this.

Id: [0x002B7CB2]
Thank you for this.

Id: [0x002B7CF7]
I pledged my life's oath to Hemming Jarl. There is nothing I would not do for him.

Id: [0x002B7D29]
For Oswald!

Id: [0x002B7D2B]
For East Anglia.

Id: [0x002B7D2D]
Fight to be free of this pain. Fight to be free of fear.

Id: [0x002B7D2E]
Fight to be free of this pain. Fight to be free of fear.

Id: [0x002B7D30]
This land you call home is on the verge of ruin. Burned and pillaged by Rued's clan, it bears the scars of an age of endless war.

Near as we can tell, about seventy-five thousand years ago. Hard to pinpoint an exact date. I can't tell if it was a Tuesday.

Id: [0x002B7D3F]
That's a long time. So why won't they leave us the hell alone?

Id: [0x002B7D40]
Good question. I think a blinding arrogance, coupled with a crippling fear of extinction, would drive a lot of people to desperate measures.

Id: [0x002B7D41]
They knew their human creations would survive the coming catastrophe.

Id: [0x002B7D42]
So a few of them devised ways to carry their imprint forward, hoping that, well, we might be able to resurrect them at some point in the future.

Id: [0x002B7D43]
Would you resurrect one if you could?

Id: [0x002B7D44]
Well … we tried once before. Didn't work out.

Id: [0x002B7D47]
Right…

Id: [0x002B7D49]
How would that work?

Id: [0x002B7D4A]
We know that one Isu was able to implant her husband's DNA into a human bloodline, causing him to be reborn every few generations.

Id: [0x002B7D4B]
This footage appears to show something similar. Same technology, different application. That's all I can say for sure.

Id: [0x002B7D4C]
It's not gonna help me sleep at night. I can tell you that!

Id: [0x002B7D61]
Come on, the feast table won't fill itself!

Id: [0x002B7D63]
How wondrously strange! Your tales are worthy of the hearing. We'll not ride our boars but eat them! A feast in Alfida's honor.

Id: [0x002B7D64]
I once knew a strong-armed shield maiden who rode a boar into battle! She named it Bristle-bold.

My bow-arm aches! We did well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B7D73]
They are giving ground! Push them back!

Id: [0x002B7D74]
They are giving ground! Push them back!

Id: [0x002B7DA2]
No slacking now!

We're told you know of a holy woman. Fulke. Where is she now?

Id: [0x002B7F6C]
Hm?

Id: [0x002B7F6D]
Hm?

Id: [0x002B806E]
We risk losing all the gains we've made here for the sake of this woman.

Id: [0x002B806F]
We risk losing all the gains we've made here for the sake of this woman.

Id: [0x002B8071]
We have a camp to the east at Linforda. An old harbor on the Great Ouse. Meet us there.

Id: [0x002B8072]
Stay quiet or I'll not be able to stop my friend from slitting your throat.

Id: [0x002B80DC]
What is this?

Id: [0x002B80DD]
What is this?

Id: [0x002B814D]
This is why you batter down my gates, kill my men, for a purse of grubby coin? You have no honor!

Id: [0x002B8150]
I mean no offense, thegn. You are only a hefty ransom to me, nothing more.

Id: [0x002B8151]
I mean no offense, thegn. You are only a hefty ransom to me, nothing more.

Id: [0x002B8152]
Enough, or I'll return you to the Saxons with ten fewer fingers.

However deranged she might be, my brother wishes to meet her. The sooner you make this happen, the swifter this war will end.

However deranged she might be, my brother wishes to meet her. The sooner you make this happen, the swifter this war will end.

If you want my backing, Brother, you'll explain yourself. How is a madwoman central to your plans?

Id: [0x002B815D]
If you want my backing, Brother, you'll explain yourself. How is a madwoman central to your plans?

Id: [0x002B815E]
When we find her, I will tell you all you wish to know. Until then, nothing.

Id: [0x002B8164]
(scream)

Id: [0x002B8168]
Good. Now remember … it is not me you are flyting. I am but a conduit for his words.

Id: [0x002B816A]
I will keep this well in mind.

Id: [0x002B816B]
I'll keep this well in mind.

Id: [0x002B8181]
Why? In God's name. I've done nothing to her.

Id: [0x002B8183]
The high priestess, Modron, tried to kill you.

Id: [0x002B8184]
The high priestess, Modron, tried to kill you.

She feared the Church would use you as god's hammer. So she convinced Cynon to have you killed.

Sigurd! What has … what has happened?

Id: [0x002B819D]
This was not for you, Havi.

Id: [0x002B81A4]
Are you ready now? The fyrd is itching for a fight.

Id: [0x002B81AA]
You will live to be ealdorman yet, Tewdwr. Despite the many attempts on your life.

Id: [0x002B81AB]
You will live to be ealdorman yet, Tewdwr. Despite the many attempts on your life.

Id: [0x002B81AE]
That day the brigands tied us up. Did you ever imagine we'd end up here?

Id: [0x002B81AF]
Never in my life. I thought I would be a warrior standing on a pile of corpses, knife in teeth, bathed in the blood of my enemies.

Id: [0x002B81B0]
Ah, well, uh … the night is young.

Id: [0x002B81B2]
Tarben. I suppose that will be you next, hm? Bonded in marriage?

Id: [0x002B81B3]
No, no. I would not make much of a husband, I think.

Id: [0x002B81BE]
Someone took a nasty fall.

Id: [0x002B81BF]
Someone took a nasty fall.

Id: [0x002B81CD]
So many fallen Danes. They were fleeing as they fought.

Id: [0x002B81CE]
So many fallen Danes. They were fleeing as they fought.

Id: [0x002B81D3]
Do you need anything else?

Id: [0x002B81D4]
Ealdorman Wigmund drove those Danes from Grantebridge like cattle.

Id: [0x002B81D5]
Slaughtered them like cattle too. Shame we have to take prisoners at all.

Id: [0x002B81DC]
Lord Wigmund'll see you hanged from the tree in the city square.

Id: [0x002B81E9]
For Oswald!

Id: [0x002B81EA]
For Oswald!

Id: [0x002B81EB]
Freedom!

Id: [0x002B81EC]
Freedom!

Id: [0x002B81ED]
Freedom!

Id: [0x002B81EE]
For East Anglia.

Id: [0x002B81EF]
For East Anglia.

Id: [0x002B8202]
Thought you could destroy my pots, did you? I can always get more pots.

Id: [0x002B892B]
Now to the inner gate!

Id: [0x002B892C]
Now to the inner gate!

Id: [0x002B893A]
But it is not conflict that binds us. It is compassion.

Id: [0x002B893B]
So … to my Dane friends and neighbors, I give thanks for the bravery you have shown during our collective struggles.

Id: [0x002B8951]
The people of East Anglia have spoken, Rued. Give yourself over.

Id: [0x002B8952]
Taken prisoner to a Saxon? To you? Never.

Id: [0x002B8958]
May the skalds sing of you as the gods embrace you. Feast, my friend, in the halls of the free and brave.

Id: [0x002B8959]
May the skalds sing of you as the gods embrace you. Feast, my friend, in the halls of the free and brave.

Id: [0x002B895C]
And for my fellow Christians, may we continue standing as examples of our Lord's grace. Lights in the dark.

Id: [0x002B895D]
Still a bit soft on insults, but the king has courage.

Id: [0x002B8966]
I'll not give you the satisfaction of a good death, for my God forbids such cruelty. Therefore you are outcast from this moment on.

Id: [0x002B8971]
You think yourself above the Danes?

Id: [0x002B8972]
I think no such thing. Only God is above us, of both Saxon and Dane alike.

Id: [0x002B8973]
You and your slaver god. Pathetic!

Id: [0x002B8976]
I do not understand this Saxon religion.

Id: [0x002B8977]
Oswald is a coin, one side mercy, the other courage. There're few like him, I'll admit.

Id: [0x002B8978]
Saxon or Dane.

Id: [0x002B897A]
Such a strange display. Courage and restraint like I have never seen.

Id: [0x002B897C]
With all that's happened, with all the chaos Rued wrought … still Oswald found reason to spare him.

Id: [0x002B897E]
A remarkable thing. From what inner spring does such kindness run? I'd like to know.

Id: [0x002B8980]
With my duty here fulfilled, I now choose East Anglia. I fight for you, my king.

Id: [0x002B8985]
It's a strange thing.

Id: [0x002B8986]
It is a strange thing.

Id: [0x002B8987]
Be well, Finnr. Your choice is a bold one.

Id: [0x002B8988]
Be well, Finnr. Your choice is a bold one.

Id: [0x002B898B]
You'd dare try and bed my Valdis!

Id: [0x002B898C]
She's not yours to do with as you please.

Id: [0x002B898D]
Of course she is. Just as East Anglia is!

Id: [0x002B899C]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002B899E]
This man must die for the damage he has wrought. The old laws are clear.

Id: [0x002B89A0]
Yes, it is I, Thegn Tedmund. Coming to discuss the orders I gave you not one day ago.

Id: [0x002B89A4]
It need not be the last.

Id: [0x002B89A5]
It need not be the last.

Id: [0x002B89A6]
Blood for blood leaves no warmth in the hearts of men, Eivor. None at all.

Id: [0x002B89A8]
Eivor, I'm about to address our guests, and I'd like you to be there.

Id: [0x002B89AA]
It's been a worthy ceremony so far.

Id: [0x002B89AB]
It has been a worthy ceremony so far.

Id: [0x002B89B3]
Ah, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B89BB]
You continue to surprise, Oswald of Elmenham.

Id: [0x002B89BC]
You continue to surprise, Oswald of Elmenham.

Id: [0x002B89F4]
Her motives are difficult to fathom. But that can come later. Let's find your brother first.

Id: [0x002B89F6]
A person's tongue gives you a taste of their heart, Eivor. And such information is often useful.

Id: [0x002B89F8]
It was only a figure of speech, Eivor. And I have tired of it already.

Id: [0x002B89F9]
Making new friends?

Id: [0x002B89FA]
Making new friends?

Id: [0x002B89FB]
And how do these sallow Christians taste?

Id: [0x002B89FC]
And how do these sallow Christians taste?

Id: [0x002B8A0E]
O, just a trifle, Eivor. A little problem I believe you can help me with.

Id: [0x002B8A2C]
Yes, yes. Hurry along, men. Warm thighs and ale awaits!

Id: [0x002B8A2D]
You will not see another sunrise, swine balls.

Id: [0x002B8A2F]
Rouecistre will not be an easy nut to crack. Time to prepare.

Those who remain must be saved. Whatever the cost.

Id: [0x002B8A3E]
Only through seidr will you see more clearly and unravel the threads that sit tangled upon your mind.

Id: [0x002B8A42]
Did she speak to you of the Betrayer's scripture? I am troubled in my spirit.

Id: [0x002B8A43]
Shhh, it is heresy to even think on it. Forget her words, her blasphemies. Think only on Christ and his redemptive message.

Id: [0x002B8A44]
She spoke freely of a deceit of angels. That we are the defiled race, ones who can never find salvation!

Id: [0x002B8A45]
If you are Hell-bent on believing this, you are already lost to the Lord of Flies.

Id: [0x002B8A4C]
God teaches obedience and humility, and yet our abbot would defy Aelfred?

Id: [0x002B8A4D]
How so? He is simply being a good shepherd, keeping Cent and her rich lands in the hands of the Church.

Id: [0x002B8A4E]
But the Danes? Do they not nestle at our borders? Like ash-scaled serpents?

Id: [0x002B8A4F]
Danes in Cent? I don't believe it. Aelfred overspeaks their danger so he may take from us as he pleases.

Id: [0x002B8A52]
A bear? Of fur and tears? Why does he cry?

Id: [0x002B8A53]
My brother saw him in the old stone ring with his own eyes. Rubbed them twice to be sure.

Id: [0x002B8A54]
Someone should do something.

Id: [0x002B8A55]
What? Ask him to move on? Or perhaps he can live with us here and the children will ride his matted back?

Id: [0x002B8A57]
Your king will not be happy, his Church meddling in his politics.

Id: [0x002B8A58]

I heard he was captured by Danes, and they ate his heart.

Id: [0x002B8A5A]
Ealdorman Deogol got blind drunk and likely staggered off the white cliffs.

Id: [0x002B8A5B]
So who will take his place? Thegn Fairfax? Landry? Tedmund?

Id: [0x002B8A5C]
None are worth the shit on a sheep's arse. I would not cast my vote for one of them.

Id: [0x002B8A5D]
A defiant stance for one who cannot cast a vote.

Id: [0x002B8A5F]
[ONO: Pained gasp]I didn't think… I hoped you would spare her at least.

Id: [0x002B8A61]
Gwen.

Id: [0x002B8A62]
Please don't do it. We can burn something else. Someone else.

Id: [0x002B8A65]
Dead and burned on a pyre much like this one.

Id: [0x002B8A66]
Dead and burned on a pyre much like this one.

Id: [0x002B8A67]
I'm feeling better, friend. Just need a moment to gather my strength.

Id: [0x002B8A68]
He's gotten so paranoid now, he won't even leave the keep tower. Captain's calling him Mouse-Balls.

Id: [0x002B8A69]
What's made him so frightened?

Id: [0x002B8A6A]
He said the Danes are coming. Coming for him. He saw it in a dream.

Id: [0x002B8A6C]
Let's hope Mouse-Balls doesn't end up our next ealdorman.

Id: [0x002B8A74]
They sent my husband to work at the Beamasfield, the lumber mill. They mean to fortify us against the Danes.

Id: [0x002B8A75]
My sister said they're all tall and strong. Muscles rippling, hair braided and woven with spice.

Id: [0x002B8A76]
And what will you do if one carries you off?

Id: [0x002B8A7A]
All in good time. Now, if we are done, I have business up the south coast. Folcanstan has the best fish in Wessex.

Do I walk among the dead?

Id: [0x002B8A96]
Do I walk among the dead?

Id: [0x002B8A97]
I've been wondering that myself! Did someone bring news of the ealdorman? Lord Landry'd make a good one.

Id: [0x002B8A9C]
So, I will be here. And, a long, long time from now, when you're old and wrinkled like an apple … you will see me again.

Id: [0x002B8A9D]
Where are you going? Come back!

Id: [0x002B8A9F]
Norse? Ha! Was he part of the fight here? Prob'ly killed by Eadwyn's soldiers. Get gone while you can!

I'm looking for my brother, a large outspoken Norseman.

I'm looking for two men. Not locals, a Norse and an Arab.

So long ago… Some poetic symmetry after twenty years prosperity.

Id: [0x002B8C1D]
I take no pleasure in the suffering of others. You would know this if you had given me a chance.

Id: [0x002B8C1F]
When you're ready for war, you'll find me at a camp near Cyne Belle Castle.

Id: [0x002B8C21]
Eadwyn's soldiers've got us in a tough spot. We're grateful for any help you can give.

Id: [0x002B8C24]
Eadwyn's men! They're after us.

Id: [0x002B8C25]
You there. What's wrong?

Id: [0x002B8C26]
You there. What's wrong?

Id: [0x002B8C2C]
None can take Cynon's place. And to put his corpse in the pyre would be an insult. [beat]Christ turns his eyes from this ritual.

Id: [0x002B8C30]
But you condone it?

Id: [0x002B8C31]

Imprisoned at the Saint Albanes monastery, just around the bend.

First they will demand taxes, and soon after they will be living in our homes!

Fine by me! If those bacrauts (assholes) come to our door, I will carve them new shit holes!

Id: [0x002B8C50]
That was a near-run thing. Thanks for helping us out.

Id: [0x002B8C51]
I asked Paul to hide it well. But I do not know where.

Id: [0x002B8C52]
Dear God!

Id: [0x002B8C58]
You pulled our asses out of the fire, friend. We're grateful to you.

Id: [0x002B8C59]
Caught 'em by the balls, we did! Well done, wayfarer, couldn't've done it without you.

Forgive me. I often presume too much of my audience. Men who fear damnation, when ignorance is the greatest of all evils.

Id: [0x002B8CD2]
Not elusive Self-Begotten Light who reigns over all.

Id: [0x002B8CD5]
How is that possible? You don't believe such a thing yourself, do you?

Id: [0x002B8CD6]
How is that possible? You don't believe such a thing yourself, do you?

Id: [0x002B8D3E]
On your own? Must be quite a story. Let's see how they've recovered since you left.

Id: [0x002B8D3F]
I've torn through this fort before.

Id: [0x002B8D40]
I have torn through this fort before.

Id: [0x002B8D4E]
I beat you to this place. We raided here not long ago.

Id: [0x002B8D4F]
I beat you to this place. We raided here not long ago.

Id: [0x002B8D57]
Weeks of fasting and prayer and abstinence can clarify that which we otherwise fail to see.

Id: [0x002B8D5A]
I don't know. I want to deny it, but I've … I've seen things in my life. Visions. Prophecies.

Id: [0x002B8D5B]
I don't know. I want to deny it, but I've … I've seen things in my life. Visions. Prophecies.

Id: [0x002B8D5C]
You've spent too much time locked in that fetid cell, Fulke.

Id: [0x002B8D5D]
You spent too much time locked in that fetid cell, Fulke.

Id: [0x002B8D5E]
Heed your visions, always. You may have been touched by true knowledge.

Id: [0x002B8DA2]
Rescue us! We can help!

Id: [0x002B8DA5]
Are you ready for my address?

Id: [0x002B8DA6]
Oswald.

Id: [0x002B8DA7]
Oswald.

Id: [0x002B8DA9]
A part of me worried you wouldn't.

Id: [0x002B8DAA]
Yet, I arrived in the end.

Id: [0x002B8DAB]
Yet, I arrived in the end.

Id: [0x002B8DBA]
Eivor. You've done East Anglia a great service. I promised you an alliance, and now you have it.

Id: [0x002B8DBD]
And one day, I will need you to make good on that alliance.

Id: [0x002B8DBE]
And one day, I will need you to make good on that alliance.

Id: [0x002B8DBF]
And Eivor, if you can help me right this situation, you'll have a strong alliance with East Anglia. That much I promise.

Id: [0x002B8DC1]
Victory was hard won, but we did it. Rued's clan is blown to ash.

Id: [0x002B8DCD]
But now, my heart burns bright, with newfound fire. I want to live hard, die fierce.

Id: [0x002B8E01]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002B8E08]
Ah, that'll do nicely.

Id: [0x002B8E09]
I'll kill you before I let you take this fortress.

Id: [0x002B8E0A]
I'll cut you down, Dane.

Id: [0x002B8E0B]
Rouecistre will not fall to you rabid pack of mongrels.

Id: [0x002B8E0C]
Kill me, and all of Wessex will rise against you!

Id: [0x002B8E20]
As long as it does, you will always be a welcome guest.

Id: [0x002B8E22]
That is good to hear, Oswald. May your family reign here for many generations.

Id: [0x002B8E23]
That's good to hear, Oswald. May your family reign here for many generations.

Id: [0x002B8E26]
You're talking of Estrid?

Id: [0x002B8E27]
You're talking of Estrid?

Id: [0x002B8E29]
I-I-I was on a mountain in a violent blizzard, climbing toward the summit, following a wolf.

Id: [0x002B8E2A]
I … I was on a mountain in a violent blizzard, climbing toward the summit, following a wolf.

Id: [0x002B8E2B]
Hm hm.

Id: [0x002B8E30]
How are you, lord?

Id: [0x002B8E31]
How are you, lord?

Id: [0x002B8E32]
Though tinged with arrogance, Aelfgar is competent and wealthy. He'd be a good ealdorman … but a faithful ally?

Id: [0x002B8E33]
Though tinged with arrogance, Aelfgar is competent and wealthy. He'd be a good ealdorman … but a faithful ally?

Id: [0x002B8E61]
You heard the lady! Leave no one alive.

Id: [0x002B8E64]
This will not be for nothing, Eivor. We will find Sigurd.

Id: [0x002B8E66]
It's not just him. I want Fulke to suffer!

Id: [0x002B8E67]
It's not just him. I want Fulke to suffer!

Id: [0x002B8E68]
I guard you like a father. Nothing is served with your brutal end. You have much to do in this life, I know it.

Id: [0x002B8E6A]
This is a trap. Why would Fulke give us her sanctum?

Id: [0x002B8E6D]
He is not. Fulke prizes him too highly.

Id: [0x002B8E6E]
More riddles, sly-tongue.

Id: [0x002B8E6F]
More riddles, sly-tongue.

Id: [0x002B8E70]
She baits us. Cocksure and arrogant. But she cannot see failure in her path.

Id: [0x002B8E71]
She baits us. Cocksure and arrogant. But she cannot see failure in her path.

Id: [0x002B8E74]
A subtle blade is needed here. Let not your fury drive you to your jarl. Your death will not help him.

Id: [0x002B8E76]
We'll find him.

Id: [0x002B8E77]
We'll find him.

Id: [0x002B8E79]
Then let us go.

Id: [0x002B8E7A]
This must be the way to Fulke's sanctum.

Id: [0x002B8E7B]
This must be the way to Fulke's sanctum.

Id: [0x002B8E7C]
Enemies of The Order! Kill them both!

Id: [0x002B8E7D]
Guards! To arms!

Id: [0x002B8E7E]
There is much here that Hytham can make use of.

Id: [0x002B8E98]
Him and the bard ended up in the copse by the bridge doing the Lord knows what. Sounded like they were murdering a cat.

Id: [0x002B8E9B]
Aelfred's emissary. Where?

Id: [0x002B8E9C]
Aelfred's emissary. Where?

Id: [0x002B8E9D]
I am witty! Finally someone sees. I'm always telling the wife, but will she listen? Will she bollocks.

Id: [0x002B8EBC]
He said it is where they train those religious fanatics. Zealots! They pray all night instead of sleeping!

Id: [0x002B8EC8]
Manual labor! God's blood! There's a fortress to the southeast where paladins pray by night and fight by day. Dover, on the white cliffs.

Id: [0x002B8EC9]
Have some coin. And rent a proper bed for the night.

Id: [0x002B8ECA]

A more honest profession? Plowing fields, milking cows…

Id: [0x002B8ECC]
A more honest profession? Plowing fields, milking cows…

Id: [0x002B8ECD]
Ah, bless you, for stories are my currency friend. How else am I to make my living?

Id: [0x002B8ED0]
You and Aelfred's emissary were drinking in the tavern. Tell me where he went.

Id: [0x002B8ED1]
You and Aelfred's emissary were drinking in the tavern. Tell me where he went.

Id: [0x002B8ED5]
How about something long and sharp in your gut?

Id: [0x002B8ED6]
How about something long and sharp in your gut?

Id: [0x002B8ED7]
My thanks, and in return, wisdom. Too much beer-bibbing will grow a fool in wit and words.

Id: [0x002B8EDC]
You Danes aren't much for bargaining, are you? He was heading for the white coast to the southeast. Dover Fortress.

Id: [0x002B8EDD]
You saw simulations of that era, didn't you?

Id: [0x002B8EDE]
I did, but it's hard to know what was real and what was invented. There was Isu tech mixed with Greek architecture.

Id: [0x002B8EDF]
It felt crafted. For a purpose. Like Aletheia was testing me.

Id: [0x002B8EE0]
I'd love to see the playbacks of those simulations. Can you get them?

Id: [0x002B8EE1]
Not likely. I'd have to talk with my old team and … well, it was a hard time.

Id: [0x002B8EE2]
Right…

Id: [0x002B8EE5]
Not like the hazy filtered footage we've seen from Sages in the past.

Id: [0x002B8EE6]
Right. But what source? Who sent these?

Id: [0x002B8EE7]
I wish I knew. It's not from Eivor, so … who the hell knows?

Id: [0x002B8F05]
The men are spent. We've not a chance in blazing Hell.

Id: [0x002B8F09]
Go on then. Your master awaits.

Id: [0x002B8F0A]
It's not dreams that led me here, Eivor. I've had visions. Prophecies from the gods.

Id: [0x002B8F17]
I'm here to speak with Geadric.

Id: [0x002B8F18]
I'm here to speak with Geadric.

Id: [0x002B8F19]
Still dreaming of your precious stone?

Id: [0x002B8F1A]
Still dreaming of your precious stone?

Id: [0x002B8F49]
For your hearing, I harken, O Ancient Ones! Great Odin, great Freyja, I give you thanks for your gift of seidr (magic).

Id: [0x002B8F4A]
Eivor, it has been some time. What brings you so far to see me?

Id: [0x002B8F4E]
Valka…?

Id: [0x002B8F4F]
Valka…?

Id: [0x002B8F59]
I am ready.

Id: [0x002B8F5B]
Called in a dragon to help me slay Rhodri. Now what say you, Wolf-Kissed? Are you ready for war?

Id: [0x002B8F5C]
Ready to take this miserable castle? The dragon is hungry for Briton blood.

Id: [0x002B8F5F]
Bah!

Id: [0x002B8F60]
What in the name of Loki have you done?

Id: [0x002B8F61]
What in the name of Loki have you done?

Id: [0x002B8F64]
Rally the men, Ivarr. Let's have at it.

Id: [0x002B8F65]
Rally the men, Ivarr. Let's have at it.

Id: [0x002B8F66]
We're not ready yet. Patience, my friend.

Id: [0x002B8F67]
We're not ready yet. Patience, my friend.

Id: [0x002B8F75]
O my!

Id: [0x002B8F7B]
I'm with you.

Id: [0x002B8FB2]
And Layla?

Id: [0x002B8FB4]
Now then. A new world awaits.

Id: [0x002B8FB7]
Billions upon billions of new timelines to explore.

Id: [0x002B8FB8]
If Desmond had let the world be destroyed, maybe the humans that survived would have learned something from the disaster.

Id: [0x002B8FB9]
And maybe, in one of those timelines, they could have found a way to prevent it from happening ever again.

Id: [0x002B8FBA]
You're leaving now?

Id: [0x002B8FBD]
I should. Your wedding should be a day of peace and happiness. Today I lack both.

Id: [0x002B8FBE]
I should. Your wedding should be a day of peace and happiness. Today I lack both.

Id: [0x002B9012]
Hm. Come to think of it, I noticed one of the longships wasn't where it usually is. It was beached further north, on the riverbank.

Id: [0x002B9016]
Did you see anything strange on the night of the attack?

Id: [0x002B9017]
Did you see anything strange on the night of the attack?

Id: [0x002B9018]
Where was this?

Id: [0x002B9019]
Where was this?

Id: [0x002B901B]
Only Lif! Fighting bravely. Did you know Lif carves a poem in each of his longships? He's craftsman and a wordsmith!

Id: [0x002B9020]
Lost in the fog of the Fenlands, sadly. If I could reclaim them, I would. To return his works of art? He'd be so grateful!

Id: [0x002B9023]
Did you see anything the night of the attack?

Id: [0x002B9024]
Did you see anything the night of the attack?

Id: [0x002B9030]
Some weeks ago, our ealdorman in Cent was called to God. A terrible loss.

Id: [0x002B9033]
Why not kill him in secret and petition Aelfred for the seat?

Id: [0x002B9034]
Why not kill him in secret and petition Aelfred for the seat?

Id: [0x002B9035]
Does this not delight you, Eivor? A chance to defy Aelfred?

Id: [0x002B9038]
I want … early access. To woo him, before his exalted position is made public and every fool is at his door.

Id: [0x002B9039]
All of Cent will see soon enough which thegn he has chosen. Why not wait?

Id: [0x002B903A]
All of Cent will see soon enough which thegn he has chosen. Why not wait?

Id: [0x002B9042]
I suppose we'll see. What will you do?

Id: [0x002B9043]

The bard said paladins trained at this fortress. This will not be an easy fight.

Cent's new ealdorman will be Thegn Tedmund.

Id: [0x002B906B]
Cent's new ealdorman will be Thegn Tedmund.

Id: [0x002B906C]
Tedmund! O, the Lord is testing me. He is made mouse by you Danes! Barely leaves his fortress at Rouecistre.

Id: [0x002B9073]
To inspire loyalty, Tedmund must owe you something. Such as … his life?

Id: [0x002B9074]
To inspire loyalty, Tedmund must owe you something. Such as … his life?

Seems Leofrith is at odds with his king, but bound to duty. A loyal man.

Watch the handmaidens! I'll follow Aethelswith.

Id: [0x002B9088]
No square. Only sweat and blood!

Id: [0x002B908B]
Your life is God's.

Id: [0x002B908D]
Now go, leave my kingdom and never return.

Id: [0x002B908E]
Rise, old friend. You're embarrassing me.

Id: [0x002B908F]
(groaning)

Id: [0x002B9090]
My warriors will distract the Saxon forces at the gate. You and I will find the priest.

Id: [0x002B9092]
Lord Wigmund of Walden carries with him the blessings of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!

Id: [0x002B9093]
This priest's lies will not poison the shire any more. We should leave.

Id: [0x002B90A1]
Swell? It would know no bounds. But that fortress will be harder to pry open than a nun's knees.

Id: [0x002B90A5]
Stop caterwauling and you will live.

Id: [0x002B90A6]
Stop caterwauling and you'll live.

Who are you? Speak quickly, or I will slit your throat and leave you for the crows.

Who are you? Speak quickly, or I will slit your throat and leave you for the crows.

Id: [0x002B90C4]
Shergar! I am called Shergar! Lord Tedmund pays me a measly coin to serve as his double!

Id: [0x002B90C9]
My orders come by letter, never by mouth. I hardly know the man.[sob]

Id: [0x002B90CA]
We can use you yet, Shergar. Summon Tedmund to a meeting. Get him out in the open.

Id: [0x002B90CB]
We can use you yet, Shergar. Summon Tedmund to a meeting. Get him out in the open.

Id: [0x002B90CC]
Tedmund has no care for me or what I have to say.

Id: [0x002B90CE]
I … I couldn't say. I've only been there once. But Tedmund has holed himself in its keep, and that's all but impregnable.

Id: [0x002B90D2]
You're of no use to us then. Perhaps I should just kill you, here and now.

Id: [0x002B90D3]
You're of no use to us then. Perhaps I should just kill you, here and now.

Id: [0x002B90D4]
No! wait, wait. Let me think. Let me think!

Id: [0x002B90D7]
Ah! Danes! To storm the walls, you need Danes! There's a raiding camp west of here I was told to be wary of.

Id: [0x002B90D9]
If another band of Danes wants to join our assault, we'll have the distraction we need to get inside Rouecistre.

Id: [0x002B90DA]
If another band of Danes wants to join our assault, we'll have the distraction we need to get inside Rouecistre.

Id: [0x002B90DC]
If the Saxons don't slaughter them first.

Id: [0x002B90DD]
I am still Tedmund to the men in the field. I could speak with their captain, send his men away.

Id: [0x002B90DF]
It's a fearless plan.

Id: [0x002B90E3]
Do what you want with him. I won't risk our plan on the shambling of this fool.

Id: [0x002B90E4]
Do what you want with him. I won't risk our plan on the shambling of this fool.

Id: [0x002B90E6]
He'll come with us. And if he betrays me, I will roast his balls over a roaring fire.

Id: [0x002B90E7]
He'll come with us. And if he betrays me, I will roast his balls over a roaring fire.

Id: [0x002B90ED]
Perhaps. Perhaps not. I do not presume to know a man's heart in so brief a meeting.

Id: [0x002B90F0]
Shergar was quick to betray his lord. Do you not think he would sell us out as swiftly?

It is best to snare a wasp with honey. Have you ever considered more subtlety?

Id: [0x002B90F4]
It is both art and science to bend a man to your will. And harder still to convince them that they are firmly in control.

Id: [0x002B90F5]
I leave manipulation to you, Basim. You appear to see it as an art.

Id: [0x002B90F6]

We are nearing the camp. Let us hope there are Danes enough to storm a fortress. Otherwise, this abbot's game is a long one.

We are nearing the camp. Let us hope there are Danes enough to storm a fortress. Otherwise, this abbot's game is a long one.

Id: [0x002B90FB]
It must be played if we are to reclaim Sigurd.

Id: [0x002B90FE]
We have a small fleet moored upriver. But a naval chain blocks passage to Rouecistre's walls.

Id: [0x002B90FF]
And we have no allies in Wessex, none who could be called upon to attack their countrymen.

Id: [0x002B9102]
It is already done. Your people can bring their ships.

Id: [0x002B9103]
It is already done. Your people can bring their ships.

Id: [0x002B9108]
Their sacrifice was great … their gift will be all the greater.

Id: [0x002B910A]
My warriors were denied Valhalla today. I cannot bear the idea of gifting their weapons to more Saxons.

Id: [0x002B910B]
Runa Egilsdottir.

We need ships, Runa.

Rally our army. We will drag this mouse from his hole.

You will never find him. Not 'til I have had my fill.

Id: [0x002B9159]
Well that concludes supper.

Id: [0x002B915F]
I hope all this innocent sacrifice is worth the trouble.

Id: [0x002B9162]
It's Sigurd. My brother. Of course it is.

No riddles. I sense a greatness within you both. Your destiny is not to stain the stones of this God-house with your blood.

Id: [0x002B9168]
You chastise me like a child, Basim.

Id: [0x002B9169]
You chastise me like a child, Basim.

Her fearful wit would say otherwise.

Id: [0x002B91A6]
It's only the beginning. We have a lot of data to sift through.

Id: [0x002B91A7]
I'm not worried, I have the Staff of Eden. It heals and protects.

Id: [0x002B91A8]
No … you do not.

Id: [0x002B91A9]
No, don't you see? As soon as he begins to sound good, that is the moment you know you have had too much to drink!

Id: [0x002B91AD]
By my calculations you have … seventy-three seconds before your exposure is lethal.

Id: [0x002B91B0]
What? How?

Id: [0x002B91B2]
Of course…

Id: [0x002B91B3]
Of course?

Id: [0x002B91B5]
Fuck…

Id: [0x002B91B6]
All right. We'll find a solution together. However long it takes. And if that means I can never leave … so be it.

Id: [0x002B91B7]
I owe this to the people I … I hurt. And the people I love.

Id: [0x002B91B8]
Yes. I know the feeling.

Id: [0x002B91BC]
Let's get going, huh? A few billion timelines might take a while.

Id: [0x002B91BD]
It will.

Id: [0x002B91C1]
But it will not feel like it. That is what I like about this place.

Id: [0x002B91C8]
Agreed.

Id: [0x002B91CA]
I know. I feel the same.

Id: [0x002B91CB]
Before that time, it would be best to keep all discussions about … about us … to yourself.

Id: [0x002B91CC]

Id: [0x002B91CF]
Thank you. And know that, however far away, you are always in my thoughts.

Thank you. And know that, however far away, you are always in my thoughts.

Id: [0x002B91D2]
In time Sigurd may come around. And if he does, he may be willing to speak.

Id: [0x002B91D3]
Yet for all her praise, she tortured him to the brink of madness and death. I do not understand why.

Id: [0x002B91D4]
Yet for all her praise, she tortured him to the brink of madness and death. I do not understand why.

Id: [0x002B91D6]
I understand.

Id: [0x002B91D7]
I understand.

Id: [0x002B91D8]
Do not let Sigurd's present mood upset you. He spoke warmly of you as we sailed him.

Id: [0x002B91DA]
That is clear. Enjoy the feast, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B91DB]
We trust each other.

Id: [0x002B91DC]
We trust each other.

Id: [0x002B91DE]
Shaun. Becs. I … I had a choice. And I chose to stay.

Id: [0x002B91E1]
Ah. And do we have a mentor? Is that still the practice?

Id: [0x002B91E2]
We do.

Id: [0x002B91E3]
Name?

Id: [0x002B91E4]
William Miles.

Id: [0x002B91E5]
William Miles.

Id: [0x002B91E6]
I'd like to meet William Miles. Would you bring him to me?

Id: [0x002B91E7]
We can call him. Encrypted line, you can talk to him right now.

Id: [0x002B91E8]
No technology. Face to face. A meeting of minds.

Id: [0x002B91F7]
You see, she's fine. In a manner of speaking.

Id: [0x002B91F8]
A manner of speaking? Jesus! We have to find her.

Id: [0x002B91F9]
You heard her. She doesn't want to be rescued.

Id: [0x002B91FA]
In any case, there's nothing left to save. Not after this long.

Id: [0x002B91FB]
Because of you! You left her there…

Id: [0x002B91FD]
This … this is all a bit much, I know. I'm in the same situation.

Id: [0x002B9200]
I won't go anywhere, my friends. Your Animus is in good hands.

Id: [0x002B9201]
How much do you know?

Id: [0x002B9202]
My dear, we invented such things long, long before you did. I'll figure it out.

Id: [0x002B9206]
[sigh]Okay.

Id: [0x002B920B]
You bested me. I don't know how, but you did. Yet I'm the one left standing.

Id: [0x002B920C]
And now I can take from you anything I want … your memories, your skills, your secrets. They're all mine…

Id: [0x002B924D]
If it's anything like the last one, absolutely.

Id: [0x002B924F]
Your signal's flickering. Another anomaly?

Id: [0x002B9250]
Yeah. Are you losing touch with me when I find these?

Id: [0x002B9252]
Damn. Try to stay with me if you can. I need you to hear these.

Id: [0x002B9253]
Good. A well-matched marriage can forge a strong alliance. So what's the hold up?

Strength and courage are always a boon, Oswald. You'll need both if you want the Danes to accept you as a king.

I've never heard of talking guts. But a swift axe would silence that inner voice in seconds. You must be prepared.

We'll forge a king out of you yet.

We will forge a king out of you yet.

Id: [0x002B9262]
Don't hold back.

Id: [0x002B9263]
Don't hold back.

Id: [0x002B9264]
Show me what you can do, Saxon.

Id: [0x002B9265]
Show me what you can do, Saxon.

Id: [0x002B9266]
Come on! Fight!

Id: [0x002B9267]
Come on! Fight!

Id: [0x002B926A]
And yet my old heart sings great songs at the sight of you. You look good, Eivor. Strong. Healthy.

Id: [0x002B928A]
And they love my son all the more. But he lacks the trust of our thegns. And I am running out of time to persuade them.

Id: [0x002B92AE]
I have known Vili since we were small. He is bold and courageous, and your warriors love the man. The nobles should choose him.

Trygve is wise, and has a keen mind to lead. At the Althing, no one would doubt his succession if he was named.

Both men are honorable, but they do not hold a bearded axe to Hemming Jarl. Let us not burden ourselves with the Althing-choice yet.

Both men are honorable, but they do not hold a bearded axe to Hemming Jarl. Let us not burden ourselves with the Althing-choice yet.

Id: [0x002B92CE]
Done.

Id: [0x002B92CF]
And if you brought gifts for the brothers, spoils from the raid, they'd be in your debt.

Id: [0x002B92D8]
Trygve and Eivor have brought us arrows and oil to bring fire-light to the Picts, to feed their traps!

Id: [0x002B92DA]
Make them pay for our lost convoy! Make them pay for lost lives and lost friends!

Id: [0x002B92E2]
For old times, then.

Id: [0x002B92E3]
For old times, then.

Id: [0x002B92F1]
You will get nothing from me, nothing!

Id: [0x002B92F2]
This is not what you think!

Id: [0x002B92F3]
Please, I am of no interest to you.

Id: [0x002B92F4]
You murdered our people! Men, women, children!

Id: [0x002B92F5]
Oi, let us free, you festering canker on a sow's arse!

Id: [0x002B92F6]
Your sister rides your piss-soaked rod.

Id: [0x002B92FC]
They have entered the cathedral! To arms!

Id: [0x002B92FD]
They must not find the sanctum.

Id: [0x002B9300]
They've breached the doors, protect the sanctum!

Id: [0x002B9301]
For the Order! For the Glory of the Ancients! Do not let these infidels find its secrets.

Id: [0x002B9362]
Eivor, come forward. And explain in plain words why you have willfully disobeyed my commands. Do you mock me?

Id: [0x002B9364]
My son might agree with you, but he would obey me. He knows his place.

Id: [0x002B9365]
I do not mock you, king. I mean to embolden you … against your enemies. And your own poor judgment.

Id: [0x002B9366]
I do not mock you, king. I mean to embolden you … against your enemies. And your own poor judgment.

Id: [0x002B936B]
I will finish it when we are certain to win, Eivor. And that day is fast approaching.

Id: [0x002B9371]
Are you so blinded by vengeance that you cannot see beyond your nose?

Id: [0x002B9373]
Your confidence blinds you to so much in plain sight, Eivor. Day and night I toil to forge ties with clans to the north.

Id: [0x002B9376]
All your talk of diplomacy is cowardice, not strategy. If you do not have the will to finish this fight, only say it.

Kjotve and his clan will never negotiate with us. They speak the language of war, so we must answer back.

Kjotve and his clan will never negotiate with us. They speak the language of war, so we must answer back.

I have waited a lifetime to take back the honor that Kjotve took from my family. Now is the time to act. My time to act.

Do we have any allies to speak of? Or is that your excuse to do nothing?

Id: [0x002B937F]
Do we have any allies to speak of? Or is that your excuse to do nothing?

Id: [0x002B9384]
Why do you carry such a useless burden? Let it go. Think only of the days to come. Of your future, and the victories at hand.

Id: [0x002B93B9]
The Mead. You seek the Mead.

Id: [0x002B93C0]
Bring me three roots from the place where the red moss thrives. Then we will speak of the Mead.

Id: [0x002B93C5]
I … I don't think so… My God … I didn't want it to come to this.

Id: [0x002B93C7]
Are you hurt? Speak up.

Id: [0x002B93C8]
Are you hurt? Speak up.

Id: [0x002B93C9]
Now don't move.

Id: [0x002B93CA]
Now don't move.

Id: [0x002B93CF]
Now, Eivor! Set it ablaze!

Id: [0x002B93D0]
Get the wagon to the gate!

Id: [0x002B93D1]
Get the wagon to the gate!

Id: [0x002B93D2]
Get back. I'll light it up.

Id: [0x002B93D3]
Get back. I'll light it up.

Id: [0x002B93D6]
Storm the castle. Give no quarter.

Id: [0x002B93D7]
Springalds! Keep your head down.

Id: [0x002B93D8]
Find cover!

Id: [0x002B93E2]
We must help her. She could be starving!

Id: [0x002B93E3]
She is crying, we have to help!

Id: [0x002B93E4]
We should get moving, drengr (courageous warrior). I can take the fortress at Templebrough.

Id: [0x002B93EB]
At one time, the title "jarl" referred to a man second only to the king. But that use has softened.

I have traveled far since we landed, and seen much on the roads and fields of this new England.

Id: [0x002B9416]
Rhodri! Show yourself!

Id: [0x002B9417]
I am here, Boneless Ragnarsson. How is it you come in force when our peace has been concluded?

Id: [0x002B9420]
If we take Tamworth, remove Burgred, and crown Ceolwulf … come morning, this shire is ours. And Mercia soon after.

Id: [0x002B9422]
Hyrrokin! You have long outstayed your welcome.

Id: [0x002B9423]
Then I will take my leave. But remember what I said, Angrboda. You will see things my way in time.

Id: [0x002B9429]
The Mead she spoke of. Where can I find it?

Id: [0x002B942A]
The Mead she spoke of. Where can I find it?

Id: [0x002B942B]
A quiet place to find an end. I almost envy you.

Id: [0x002B942C]
Please enjoy your stay! Remember, all garbage must be packed out. And please water the plants once a day.

Id: [0x002B942D]
Is it wishful thinking to believe this device has a thought interface? Do I really have to use my hands and voice?

Id: [0x002B942E]
Well done, young man. You were on to something.

Id: [0x002B942F]
Tools or instruments of torture? Or both?

Id: [0x002B9430]
Beautiful…

Id: [0x002B9431]
"You're cordially invited to John and Judy's wedding…"

Id: [0x002B9432]
"…taking place this November…"

Id: [0x002B9433]
"…village's chapel…"

Id: [0x002B9434]
That would be interesting.

Id: [0x002B9435]
Poor little plant. I looked like you not long ago.

Id: [0x002B9436]
At least they did something right.

Id: [0x002B9438]
She is powerful, and cruel, and none of your concern.

Id: [0x002B9439]
Who was your visitor?

Id: [0x002B943A]
Who was your visitor?

Id: [0x002B9440]
My Loki. He's an acquired taste. One that can soon turn sour.

Id: [0x002B9441]
Our parting was bitter. He has made many enemies among the gods.

Id: [0x002B9442]
Our parting was bitter. He has made many enemies among the gods.

Id: [0x002B9444]
How generous … and entirely unlike him. You used to be much better at lying.

Id: [0x002B9445]
Loki has stayed in Asgard, to help rebuild the damage from a recent attack.

Id: [0x002B9448]
Were we? Why would Jotnar concern ourselves with such lower beings?

Id: [0x002B944B]
You were discussing the humans in Midgard.

Id: [0x002B944C]
You were discussing the humans in Midgard.

Id: [0x002B944D]
Because you think them hardy and ambitious.

Id: [0x002B944E]
Because you think them hardy and ambitious.

Id: [0x002B944F]
You know much, Far-Seer. But not enough to save you.

If I could provide a boon of silver, would that guide your husband away from war?

Alvis tells me this brew is too strong. Think you can handle a few rounds?

Id: [0x002B946B]
Ha! Not like waving an axe around, is it? Drinking takes a strong gut.

Id: [0x002B946F]
I thought we'd be safe in the fog. But Wigmund's men hunted us, pierced my boy through his heart. He hadn't seen his sixteenth summer.

Id: [0x002B9470]
Augh. We'll make him pay the blood-debt. Him and all his Saxon allies.

Id: [0x002B9474]
I'm burning with the wrath of Odin. We'll retake Grantebridge. Then the shire.

Id: [0x002B9475]
Wigmund's rat-soldiers killed my man in his bed. He'll be in Hel now, forever. Wigmund dies for that.

Id: [0x002B9478]
That was clever.

Id: [0x002B9479]
That was clever.

Which charm protects from evil spirits?

Which charm summons aid for maidens?

Tell me, O being of air and light. Which is the charm you would use to leave the past behind?

But we do know it is time to get you three back to the settlement. Before your parents think you were eaten by wolves.

Id: [0x002B949A]
Think you can match horns with me, hm?

Id: [0x002B949C]
I could outdrink every one of you.

Id: [0x002B949D]
All right, Tekla. I'll outdrink you.

All right, Tekla. I'll outdrink you.

Our destiny awaits. Do not linger long.

Id: [0x002B94AF]
Yeah, unfortunately. For a few minutes at a time.

Id: [0x002B94B2]
Hey, are you two hearing the same voices I'm hearing?

Id: [0x002B94B3]
Not sure what you mean. It's all quiet on our end.

Id: [0x002B94B6]
Layla, hey. Becs is fiddling with the back end. Trying to get a fix on you.

Id: [0x002B94B7]
No luck. But she did show me how to decrypt your data packets. I just click a button when you've grabbed the data bits.

Id: [0x002B94BA]
I'll keep trying.

Id: [0x002B94BB]
Burgred! Where are you, you little shit! Burgred!

Id: [0x002B94BC]
Face me, lord!

Id: [0x002B94BD]
Only question is, who's feeding them to you?

Id: [0x002B94C1]
Oddly enough, that's how Rebecca describes our wedding night. Which I find rude…

Id: [0x002B94C2]
Hasting, get off the mic.

Id: [0x002B94C4]
Not bad, actually. These anomalies feel second nature now.

Id: [0x002B94C5]
Any ghosting effects? Double-identity syndrome? Occipital shock signs?

Id: [0x002B94C6]
Hey hey, you trying to freak me out? My God, just let me work.

Id: [0x002B94C7]
All right, closing in on another one.

Id: [0x002B94C8]
Sorry to freak you out earlier. It's just, the Animus can be dangerous. Prolonged exposure is hard on a brain.

Id: [0x002B94C9]
I know. I just … I wanna finish this.

Id: [0x002B94CA]
Yes. Definitely. Jump out whenever you feel worn down.

Id: [0x002B94CB]
Anomaly number seven, if I'm counting right.

Id: [0x002B94CC]
You are. Just a few more to go. Ten in total.

Id: [0x002B94CD]
Ten. Okay, I can do ten. Does the Animus give achievements for stuff like this?

Id: [0x002B94CE]
Sorry. Does it what?

Id: [0x002B94CF]
Forget it.

Id: [0x002B94D0]
Nothing coherent so far. Just random clips. Hard to say how they all fit together.

Id: [0x002B94D1]
I think there's more here than meets the eye. Just keep going.

Id: [0x002B94D2]
Burgred! I will burn it all down.

Id: [0x002B94D4]
I'm an engineer. These puzzles are child's play.

Id: [0x002B94D5]
Still, it's physical and mental. That can't be easy.

Id: [0x002B94D6]
That's true. I never had to swim through any fluid dynamics equations to solve them.

Id: [0x002B94D8]
Almost there. Eight down, two to go.

Id: [0x002B94D9]
Good. And here comes another kaleidoscopic gemstone of gibberish.

Id: [0x002B94DA]
As a matter of fact, I am, yes. Thank you for noticing, data-wrangler.

Id: [0x002B94DB]
I'm a little tired, that's about all. Why? You expecting something worse?

Id: [0x002B94DC]
Expecting the unexpected. It's hard to fully trust these things.

Id: [0x002B94DD]
I'll be careful.

Id: [0x002B94DE]
Gotcha.

Id: [0x002B94DF]
Number nine in sight. And the voices are still with me.

Id: [0x002B94E0]
That's strange. We're still not hearing anything.

Id: [0x002B94E1]
Are you sure they aren't coming from somewhere else? Like … from you?

Id: [0x002B94E2]
God, no. How would that be possible?

Id: [0x002B94E3]
Sorry, just asking.

Id: [0x002B94E5]
Becs, I'm almost at number ten. Anything happening on your end?

Id: [0x002B94E6]
Nothing. I'm decrypting the last data packet now. Here we go.

Id: [0x002B94E7]
Hold on, hold on. The fragment's unpacking itself. Gigs of compressed data.

Id: [0x002B94E8]
I think … hold on… I think we're in for something bigger than we bargained for. Get ready…

Id: [0x002B94EB]
I know my way around. We'll go through the market. This way!

Id: [0x002B954D]
The chief is dead! Run! Flee to the hills!

Id: [0x002B954F]
Did you know? About the goblets, the lead? Now's the time for truth.

Id: [0x002B9550]
Did you know? About the goblets, the lead? Now's the time for truth.

Id: [0x002B9552]
Ascend the sleeper, take the drink, and meditate at the peak. Let the answers you seek find you.

Id: [0x002B957D]
Moira. How are things in Wyke?

Id: [0x002B957E]
Moira. How are things in Wyke?

Id: [0x002B9581]
I get by. There will always be those who dislike me. But how I handle their ire is up to me … so yes, things are mostly well.

Id: [0x002B958A]
Hello, hero! Come on over for a drink, eh? It's a feast!

Id: [0x002B958C]
Go on, steady your balls! And ask her to shake arses with ya!

Id: [0x002B958D]
B-but I've n-never d-danced with anyone before…

Id: [0x002B9592]
Moira. Is Halfdan about?

Id: [0x002B9593]
Moira. Is Halfdan about?

Id: [0x002B959C]
Vili! Vili, come fast!

Id: [0x002B95B0]
Eivor! Welcome, join me in drowning this golden drink.

Id: [0x002B95C0]
O, is it? Or have you come to snatch glory from my calloused hands?

Id: [0x002B95C4]
Thor's beard, it's good to see you, Vili.

Id: [0x002B95C5]
Thor's beard, it's good to see you, Vili.

Id: [0x002B95CC]
Vili waits for you below, Eivor.

Id: [0x002B97FD]
That tower there … it recalls the broken wall in Norway, on the road to my uncle's, remember?

Id: [0x002B9806]
I have done as you asked. Now where is my wisdom?

Id: [0x002B9807]
I've done as you asked. Now where is my wisdom?

Id: [0x002B980C]
Searching for the chickens you let loose before the Yule feast, I'll have you remember.

Id: [0x002B9837]
I'm ready for whatever danger awaits. Prepare your convoy and we'll be off.

Id: [0x002B9838]
I'm ready for whatever danger awaits. Prepare your convoy and we'll be off.

Id: [0x002B983E]
Our jarl has waited long enough. We follow the Wolf-Kissed to the encampment.

Id: [0x002B9843]
My ship will draw the arrows to let the convoy pass. Only give me a moment before we go.

Id: [0x002B9844]
My ship will draw the arrows to let the convoy pass. Only give me a moment before we go.

Id: [0x002B99A4]
This was his favorite spot in the shire.

Id: [0x002B99A6]
Gone from my eyes for years, then back again so soon.

Id: [0x002B99A8]
Vili awaits at Ulkerthorpe, though Pict arrows rain over the river path.

Id: [0x002B99AA]
Yet another good omen.

Id: [0x002B99AB]
Yet another good omen.

Id: [0x002B99B9]
O'er the mountains, o'er the seas, the flame of Surtr grows…

Id: [0x002B99C9]
Did you think I would not come for you, after what you did to my son?

Id: [0x002B99CA]
I would … I would give all that … and more.

Id: [0x002B99CB]
I would … I would give all that … and more.

Id: [0x002B99CC]
Loki! What trickery is this?

Id: [0x002B99CD]
Loki! What trickery is this?

Id: [0x002B99FA]
Move quickly, please!

Id: [0x002B99FB]
Father, mother! Help! It hurts!

Id: [0x002B99FF]
An eye for an eye.

Id: [0x002B9A0C]
Tedmund is holed up in the tower keep, press forward.

Id: [0x002B9A0D]
Tedmund is holed up in the tower keep, press forward.

Id: [0x002B9A0F]
That's right. And our sense of … how should I say … deep responsibility to the betterment of mankind.

Id: [0x002B9A11]
Ah, but your brother is … someone special. Important. And I want him to see that. I hope to show it to him.

Id: [0x002B9A12]
Your creed and your tenets, you mean?

Id: [0x002B9A13]
Your creed and your tenets, you mean?

Id: [0x002B9A14]
That's quite an ambition. But it doesn't explain what you see in Sigurd. My brother is not so generous.

Id: [0x002B9A15]
That's quite an ambition. But it doesn't explain what you see in Sigurd. My brother is not so generous.

Id: [0x002B9A1D]
I am God's humble shepherd, sent to protect his lambs. If Cent's new ealdorman is a wolf, I would blunt his claws.

Id: [0x002B9A1F]
Do you have ears in every church, abbey, and cathedral in Cent? Because I do. And I will find her.

Id: [0x002B9A20]
And we will do the deeds too staining for a Christian soul.

Id: [0x002B9A21]
If we do this, how will you find Fulke? I want some kind of assurance.

Id: [0x002B9A22]
If we do this, how will you find Fulke? I want some kind of assurance.

Id: [0x002B9A4F]
And they will know justice with our victory. It will calm their restless shades. I promise. Will your men bring the armor to the battle?

Id: [0x002B9A50]
And they will know justice with our victory. It will calm their restless shades. I promise. Will your men bring the armor to the battle?

Id: [0x002B9A54]
That is the truth now. But how it will gnaw at you, knowing that to kill my son will undo your doom.

Id: [0x002B9A57]
I swore to you I would not harm him. That is the truth!

Id: [0x002B9A58]
I swore to you I would not harm him. That is the truth!

Id: [0x002B9A63]
We must be sure. Sigurd is running out of time.

Id: [0x002B9A64]
We must be sure. Sigurd is running out of time.

Id: [0x002B9A6A]
Release him, Havi. Release Fenrir, or I swear I will kill you here and now.

Id: [0x002B9AFB]
An army marches upon us from the south! A holy man from Saint Hadrian's Priory, backed by a fyrd!

Id: [0x002B9AFC]
Ah! Then Abbot Cynebert? God be praised! If riches are all you care about, the Church has it in abundance.

Id: [0x002B9AFE]
If the terms are fair, you'll have your freedom. A chest or two of silver for a shit-stained sewer rat.

Id: [0x002B9AFF]
If the terms are fair, you'll have your freedom. A chest or two of silver for a shit-stained sewer rat.

Id: [0x002B9B29]
You do that.

Id: [0x002B9B34]
They'll live just long enough to serve as an example to the others. Lord Wigmund's wrath is as grand as it is swift.

Id: [0x002B9B47]
Speak to me, O wind!

Id: [0x002B9B54]
A replenished treasury would certainly help my husband come to peace.

Id: [0x002B9B75]
Under what terms?

Id: [0x002B9B79]
The giving of silver is more difficult than I imagined.

Id: [0x002B9B7A]
The giving of silver is more difficult than I imagined.

Id: [0x002B9B7F]
Fast but not big. A little rabbit, that one.

Id: [0x002B9B81]
Would you, please? It would give me a break.

Id: [0x002B9B82]
Your Eira is growing fast.

Id: [0x002B9B83]
Your Eira is growing fast.

Id: [0x002B9B84]
Small and quick beats big and slow. I'll start taking her on raids soon.

Id: [0x002B9B85]
Small and quick beats big and slow. I'll start taking her on raids soon.

Id: [0x002B9B89]
Get me some decent wood and I can finish it in a week. But Styrbjorn won't gift me any.

Id: [0x002B9B92]
Guards! Come quickly! The Danes, they've found me!

Id: [0x002B9CDE]
Get the fucking drawbridge down.

Id: [0x002B9CDF]
We will never get through if we do not lower that drawbridge.

Id: [0x002B9CE0]
Something's holding that drawbridge up.

Id: [0x002B9CEF]
Svend, you old fool. You are lucky to be alive!

Id: [0x002B9CF0]
They ganged up on me, the cowards! Too scared to send my message to their king.

Id: [0x002B9CF2]
Will that be the end of Harald's pestering?

Id: [0x002B9D1C]
Northeast of here, along the shore. It's been a few days, though. May not be there now.

Id: [0x002B9D2E]
Where are these longships now?

Id: [0x002B9D2F]
Where are these longships now?

Id: [0x002B9D30]
To be sure. Good luck to you.

Id: [0x002B9D31]
To be sure. Good luck to you.

Id: [0x002B9D35]
We may be chopped, roasted, and eaten by these pagan cannibals. But our lives have meaning if they end in his name.

Id: [0x002B9E6D]
Hold tight, love. A new world has opened to us.

Id: [0x002B9E6E]
Once I get my bearings, there is nothing we cannot achieve.

Id: [0x002B9E87]
Careful, Eivor! These supplies bring fire to the Ulkerthorpe siege.

Id: [0x002B9E8A]
Eivor, the Raven Clan's Wolf-Kissed … you'll soon have more names than the All-Father himself.

Id: [0x002B9E8F]
I've traveled far, spilling the dew of slaughter. A reputation is the price of victory.

I've traveled far, spilling the dew of slaughter. A reputation is the price of victory.

Id: [0x002B9E9C]
The first to signal from the top of that tower, their war chief's weapon in hand, drinks my mead for the month!

Id: [0x002B9EA3]
Light the arrows! May they burn with flame unbridled!

Id: [0x002B9EB8]
Vili and the Wolf-Kissed fight by our sides again!

Id: [0x002B9EBF]
Glory to the Hemmingsons!

Id: [0x002B9EC2]
Shred my sheepskin. That there is Eivor the Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002B9EC5]
Eivor, hail! We have not laid eyes on you for some ten winters now.

Id: [0x002B9ED6]
Hemming Jarl is at the edge of death. I must see him before he goes.

Id: [0x002B9ED7]
Hemming Jarl is at the edge of death. I must see him before he goes.

Id: [0x002B9ED8]
Eivor. Hemming Jarl still clings to life.

Sunniva is waiting for me at the pyre. Some ale with her is in order.

Id: [0x002B9EDD]
Sunniva is waiting for me at the pyre. Some ale with her is in order.

Id: [0x002B9F12]
The spear is mine, Vili. And so too a month of your father's mead.

Id: [0x002B9F13]
The spear is mine, Vili. And so too a month of your father's mead.

Id: [0x002B9F26]
Now to signal our victory.

Id: [0x002B9F27]
Now to signal our victory.

Id: [0x002B9F71]
Not yet. For once you drink, your hugr will take flight and be ever-fixed. Drink only when the hour of your death approaches.

Id: [0x002B9F72]
I do. Must I drink it now?

Id: [0x002B9F73]
I do. Must I drink it now?

Id: [0x002B9F76]
Then why are we here?

Id: [0x002B9F77]
Then why are we here?

Id: [0x002B9FB6]
Ah! A good test for you, boy!

Id: [0x002BA001]
Who are you? Loitering and lollygagging?

Id: [0x002BA006]
You're a strange fish. Did you see the man or not?

Id: [0x002BA007]
You're a strange fish. Did you see the man or not?

Id: [0x002BA00A]
I'm looking for someone, an emissary from Aelfred. Have you seen such a man?

Id: [0x002BA00B]
I'm looking for someone, an emissary from Aelfred. Have you seen such a man?

Id: [0x002BA011]
Now you dangle silver before me? Are you so frightened of the Britons that you fight your battles with wealth?

Id: [0x002BA013]
Silver! Good. I can bludgeon Rhodri to death with how heavy a bag I have.

Id: [0x002BA01E]
Back to the camp. Round up the men. We're taking Tamworth tonight!

Id: [0x002BA01F]
You seat yourself as Sigurd's equal in these tales of yours. Would Sigurd do the same if he were here?

Id: [0x002BA02D]
I do not claim to be Sigurd's equal. But I will not shy from the triumphs I have fairly won, Dag.

Id: [0x002BA02E]
I do not claim to be Sigurd's equal. But I will not shy from the triumphs I have fairly won, Dag.

Id: [0x002BA031]
Sigurd knows what I have achieved. And he would celebrate it more roundly than I have here.

Id: [0x002BA032]
Sigurd knows what I have achieved. And he would celebrate it more roundly than I have.

Id: [0x002BA038]
But this takes nothing from you, all of you. For I sit among some of staunchest wills and strongest fighters I have ever known.

Id: [0x002BA039]
But this takes nothing from you, all of you. For I sit among some of staunchest wills and strongest fighters I have ever known.

Id: [0x002BA03D]
To Sigurd! May he return and relieve us of you!

Id: [0x002BA04C]
And may all of you enjoy the ale as much as Dag has. Skal!

Id: [0x002BA04D]
And may all of you enjoy the ale as much as Dag has. Skal!

Id: [0x002BA053]
You think me drunk, Eivor? Would it soften my blows if I was?

Id: [0x002BA054]
My eyes are clear and open. And I see before me one eager to claim a piece of Sigurd's glory.

Id: [0x002BA057]
All you say is nonsense, Dag. Have I done something to raise your ire?

Id: [0x002BA058]
All you say is nonsense, Dag. Have I done something to raise your ire?

Id: [0x002BA05A]
There is enough glory in the world to go around for all who earn it. And I have no doubt how much I am owed.

Lady Angharad will use the silver to bolster the royal treasury. That will reassure and calm Rhodri.

Id: [0x002BA066]
The Captain of the Guard will advise Rhodri to sign the agreement. Peace will be yours.

Id: [0x002BA076]
Ah. A wise woman indeed.

Id: [0x002BA077]
Let us pray Rhodri takes his advice.

Id: [0x002BA079]
I have yet to see Ivarr look calm.

Id: [0x002BA07B]
He promised rebellion? Are you sure this was wise?

Id: [0x002BA07C]
I gave the silver to Ivarr for his assurance that he will stay calm.

Id: [0x002BA07D]

Rhodri's brother will use the silver to take the crown himself, by force.

Id: [0x002BA0A3]
Terrible business. Poor lad.

Id: [0x002BA0A4]
I came as soon I heard. Tewdwr is missing?

Id: [0x002BA0A5]
Murdered! By those visiting Danes no less. It's true what they say, soulless killers the lot of them!

Id: [0x002BA0D0]
Give me a measure of time.

Id: [0x002BA0D1]
Give me a measure of time.

Id: [0x002BA0D6]
Then kindly remind them of their duty to Mercia, and to their king.

Id: [0x002BA0D9]
You heard Leofrith. Secure whatever food you can. The Danes won't hesitate to burn our fields. And if we can't eat, we can't fight.

Id: [0x002BA0DC]
Go with the wind and leaves, good friend of the hills!

Id: [0x002BA0DE]
Leofrith's orders … pah! The king's grown tired of him, you know. That's what all the men are saying.

Id: [0x002BA0DF]
Geadric, what have they done to you?

Id: [0x002BA0E0]
What kind of mess did you get yourself into?

Id: [0x002BA0E1]
Untie me! I can still fight these bastards!

Id: [0x002BA0F4]
That seems limiting.

Id: [0x002BA0F5]
How do you mean?

Id: [0x002BA0F7]
No, no. You're in a class all your own, man.

Id: [0x002BA0F8]
We're Assassins now, not Hidden Ones?

Id: [0x002BA0F9]

Id: [0x002BA137]
Watch the look on the old man's face when he hears what we have planned.

I felt the same. But in time, we all rise to the needs of the people.

Let it be known the Hemmings and Clan Raven are true-sworn friends from this day forward. Do you accept?

Id: [0x002BA15A]
Mm.

Id: [0x002BA169]
You have not yet answered me. Will you help with my etching?

Id: [0x002BA16A]
You have not yet answered me. Will you help with my etching?

With Hemming Jarl gone, can Vili hold the reins? Will he guide us true?

As you wish.

As you wish.

A dragon's tail it was then.

Trygve!

Trygve!

Help! Fire! Save my voda! It burns!

Id: [0x002BA268]
Come out, you dung-eating rat!

No! You'll hurt me!

You there … you alive?

Get that stain out here now!

Brothers, sisters, kin and clan. It is time.

Id: [0x002BA321]
Tired? How do you mean?

Id: [0x002BA336]
Please, retrieve my voda, I beg of you! 'Tis my funeral gift! The honor of my family at stake!

Id: [0x002BA337]
Are you blind? He questions Burgred's orders every chance he gets. Has done ever since the Danes showed up.

Id: [0x002BA339]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002BA341]
Too big to carry. But things are not always as they seem in Jotunheim.

Id: [0x002BA342]
Too big to carry. But things are not always as they seem in Jotunheim.

Id: [0x002BA348]
It will be a grand funeral. Father will have a clear view of his lands from here.

Id: [0x002BA34A]
The flames will burn bright and tall for all the shire to see. You've done well, Trygve.

Id: [0x002BA34C]
Something so well guarded must have value. I will take it with me.

Somber souls will only sip at their drinking horns. Conjure us a tune to raise their spirits.

Steel and flesh met here, but Jotnar leave no corpses.

If you have any other business, it may be wise to do it now. Let him cool down.

Id: [0x002BA37B]
I can wait out the storm a little longer.

Id: [0x002BA37C]
I can wait out the storm a little longer.

Id: [0x002BA37D]
I'm ready to face the thunder. I will speak with the king now.

Id: [0x002BA37E]
I'm ready to face the thunder. I will speak with the king now.

Id: [0x002BA3DC]
Who's your master? Is he here?

Id: [0x002BA3DD]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002BA3E1]
Once we have peace, you and your kin will no longer walk this land in wretchedness.

Id: [0x002BA3E2]
Once we have peace, you and your kin will no longer walk this land in wretchedness.

Id: [0x002BA407]
(scream)

Id: [0x002BA40B]
Hail! What has happened here?

Id: [0x002BA40C]
Hail! What has happened here?

Id: [0x002BA414]
The fog is more hindrance than hiding place now. Let's light the way back.

Id: [0x002BA892]
Enough. A new path is revealed and your journey will be challenging.

Id: [0x002BA894]
For my mother's sake, I cannot, but our threads will cross again before the final day. Until then, farewell.

Id: [0x002BA897]
How much did you hear?

Id: [0x002BA898]
How much did you hear?

Id: [0x002BA899]
Will you not join us?

Id: [0x002BA89A]
Will you not join us?

Id: [0x002BA8A9]
It's kind of you to ask, but with so much blood in the water and death on the air, I'd know your name and purpose first.

Id: [0x002BA8AB]
Quite a hit you took. How many were lost?

Id: [0x002BA8AC]
Quite a hit you took. How many were lost?

Id: [0x002BA8AE]
If you can do all that, you can call me whatever you want.

Id: [0x002BA8AF]
If I can reunite them, and we retake your city, can I call you a friend and ally?

Id: [0x002BA8B0]
If I can reunite them, and we retake your city, can I call you a friend and ally?

Id: [0x002BA8D8]
Peace, Trygve. I will do what I can to calm things.

Id: [0x002BA8D9]
Peace, Trygve. I'll do what I can to calm things.

Id: [0x002BA919]
You'll pay for your wrongs, desecrator!

Id: [0x002BA922]
There! See! The robber caught red-handed!

Id: [0x002BA924]
Loki? You should have the sense to stay far away from me, after what you did.

Id: [0x002BA925]
Loki? You should have the sense to stay far away from me, after what you did.

Id: [0x002BA927]
My future is elsewhere, Trygve. I will go with Eivor, to live and fight beside the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002BA93D]
Augustine said "Seek not to understand that you may believe, but believe that you may understand"?

Id: [0x002BA93E]
In the four centuries since Augustine wrote, many advances have been made in our understanding of the scripture!

Id: [0x002BA93F]
I … only meant that the scripture alone …

Id: [0x002BA940]
Enough! I will not hear another word. The scripture alone … this is bordering on blasphemy.

Id: [0x002BA941]
Blasphemy! No, no brother…

Id: [0x002BA942]
Never speak again until you have learned to obey God's will and not your own.

Id: [0x002BA94A]
True. But unlike us, she can carry herself as one of them. She won't hide from everyone, not with a prisoner in tow.

Id: [0x002BA94D]
So where to begin?

Id: [0x002BA94E]
So where to begin?

Id: [0x002BA952]
A gift without price, fit for a jarl's lips! But hurry! It catches flame!

Id: [0x002BA954]
What is this voda you speak of?

Id: [0x002BA955]
What is this voda you speak of?

Id: [0x002BA982]
Flee, warrior, flee! Loki's horde lays waste here!

Id: [0x002BA987]
I loved Hemming, I swear! I only want him to fly free in the Kingdom of God!

Id: [0x002BA988]
So you drench his body with your filth-waters?

Id: [0x002BA98C]
Of course! I anointed him in the name of the Lord.

Id: [0x002BA98F]
Was it your Christian holy water?

Id: [0x002BA990]
Was it your Christian holy water?

Id: [0x002BA99D]
But I only--

Id: [0x002BA9A2]
O, no…

Id: [0x002BA9A6]
He insulted our noble dead!

Id: [0x002BA9AC]
These are your neighbors. Respect them. Learn their ways.

Id: [0x002BA9AD]
These are your neighbors. Respect them. Learn their ways.

Id: [0x002BA9AE]
And you will draw breath long into old age.

And you will draw breath long into old age.

Id: [0x002BA9B0]
Hemming would laugh at the very idea.

Id: [0x002BA9B1]
Hemming would laugh at the very idea.

Id: [0x002BA9B7]
You dared Surtr's Heat! Yes! A most potent drink, distilled from grain by the Rus of Kiev. Dip your horn and have a drink.

Id: [0x002BA9BA]
Ah, balls! I dragged it all the way from Rus! It is back to water ale for me, I suppose.

Id: [0x002BA9BD]
If this is your voda, I managed to save it from the licking flames.

Id: [0x002BA9BE]
If this is your voda, I managed to save it from the licking flames.

Id: [0x002BA9BF]
It was too late for your … your voda, as you say.

Id: [0x002BA9C0]
It was too late for your … your voda, as you say.

Id: [0x002BA9C2]
Thank you, mighty Thor! You've saved my life.

Id: [0x002BA9C4]
When you sober up, steer clear of roosters.

Id: [0x002BA9C5]
When you sober up, steer clear of roosters.

Id: [0x002BA9CC]
Stay back, foul beasts! Help me! Someone help me!

Id: [0x002BA9D4]
Dragons with mighty claws! Save me from their wrath!

Id: [0x002BA9D6]
You mean Hemming's famous fighting roosters?

Id: [0x002BA9D7]
You mean Hemming's famous fighting roosters?

Id: [0x002BAA0B]
Curse you, Havi.

Id: [0x002BAA0D]
Are you finished?

Id: [0x002BAA0E]
Are you finished?

Id: [0x002BAA0F]
Your own distrust has undone you. Now go, and do not show your face again.

Id: [0x002BAA10]
Your own distrust has undone you. Now go, and do not show your face again.

Id: [0x002BAA11]
I cannot be other than I am. All this was fated. All this will happen again.

Id: [0x002BAA17]
Do not be so sure of that. The game is not over. The game is never over.

Id: [0x002BAA19]
But you will not be here to see it.

Id: [0x002BAA1A]
But you will not be here to see it.

Id: [0x002BAA1F]
Betrayer! Deceiver! I treated you as an honored guest, and this is how you repay me?

Id: [0x002BAA20]
Someone needed to warn my people of the treachery in your heart. Suttungr, show this Aesir how the Jotnar deal with thieves.

Id: [0x002BAA21]
Come. Embrace your death!

Id: [0x002BAA29]
He was not safe here. They knew what he was and knew what he would become. Just as you do!

Id: [0x002BAA2A]
You let the Jotnar into Asgard! So many dead, all so you could smuggle in your son.

Id: [0x002BAA2B]
You let the Jotnar into Asgard! So many dead, all so you could smuggle in your son.

Id: [0x002BAA37]
Eivor, here's a tune for you! One to liven your step.

Id: [0x002BAA42]
Take him to the shelter for warmth.

Id: [0x002BAA46]
Egil? Egil, look at me. Remember the boars you felled our first day in England?

Id: [0x002BAA4F]
You come like a Valkyrie out of the fog. But we have no dead to give you.

Id: [0x002BAA51]
Let's talk elsewhere. Give them a chance to rest.

Id: [0x002BAA5B]
Hey! A hot roast lamb, ready for hungry mouths!

Id: [0x002BAA5D]
My sword is gore-greedy. I am ready to fight!

Id: [0x002BAAA6]
(belch)

Id: [0x002BAAA9]
That's what I like to hear. Meet me at the western gate of Grantebridge. We've assembled there.

Id: [0x002BAAAE]
Let's take your city back.

Id: [0x002BAAAF]
Let's take your city back.

Id: [0x002BAAB7]
The dream of new lands is a powerful lure.

Id: [0x002BAAB9]
You made quick work of packing. Well done.

Id: [0x002BAABA]
You made quick work of packing. Well done.

Id: [0x002BAABE]
Sigurd, what is this assembly? What are you planning?

Id: [0x002BAABF]
An exit, Father. As graceful as I can. For if I cannot be king in the land of my birth, I will start a new saga. In England.

Id: [0x002BAAC0]
Nonsense. Your place is here, Son. At my side. There will be other victories soon, other glories.

Id: [0x002BAAD3]
No. He'll be gone, count on it. Argr (weak) coward. But we've struck a bold claim today.

Id: [0x002BAAD4]
I want you to sound our battle horn to announce our victory. Let all the shire know that Grantebridge is retaken!

Id: [0x002BAAD5]
No sign of Wigmund here. He may be hiding  within the city walls. Shall we search?

Id: [0x002BAAD6]
No sign of Wigmund here. He may be hiding within the city walls. Shall we search?

Id: [0x002BAAD8]
There are always choices, Sigurd. I will not stand between you and yours, but I do not accept it.

Id: [0x002BAAEF]
What?

Id: [0x002BAAF2]
He was killed with this.

Id: [0x002BAAF3]
He was killed with this.

Id: [0x002BAAFB]
Now that was something. Wigmund is sure to take notice.

Id: [0x002BAAFC]
Now that was something. Wigmund is sure to take notice.

Id: [0x002BAB03]
Stop. Wipe everything. Run it again.

Id: [0x002BAB04]
Nothing. No. Wipe it. Run again.

Id: [0x002BAB05]
Nothing. Wipe all data. Run it again.

Id: [0x002BAB1E]
That we did. You've proven yourself an asset to us. I'll see you back in Grantebridge.

Id: [0x002BAB21]
Well struck. We made short work of Wigmund's man.

Id: [0x002BAB22]
Well struck. We made short work of Wigmund's man.

Id: [0x002BAB25]
You go where you like. I am not quite finished here.

Id: [0x002BAB26]
Take everything!

Id: [0x002BAB27]
Pile the soldiers here! Let these people bear witness to the carnage that awaits their kingdom.

Id: [0x002BAB28]
Whoever trains these Mercian soldiers should be relieved of their duty, I think!

Id: [0x002BAB2D]
Is that how you flirt, Eivor?

Id: [0x002BAB2F]
Easy now, drengr (courageous warrior). I'll see you back in Grantebridge.

Id: [0x002BAB30]
You fought very well, Birna.

Id: [0x002BAB31]
You fought very well, Birna.

Id: [0x002BAB32]
Is that how I what?

Id: [0x002BAB33]
Is that how I what?

Id: [0x002BAB34]
And become King Killer forever more.

Id: [0x002BAB3F]
You?

Id: [0x002BAB41]
How do you come to know this?

Id: [0x002BAB42]
I am always one who desires the truth Eivor, but this … this is a hard thing to hear. Did he die well?

Id: [0x002BAB43]
I killed him.

Id: [0x002BAB44]
I killed him.

Id: [0x002BAB45]
After peace was made, Ivarr murdered Ceolbert and pinned the crime on Rhodri. To get another swing at him.

Id: [0x002BAB48]
Eivor. You're still with me through all this. Do not think I'll forget.

Id: [0x002BAB4A]
Good. At the first sign of trouble, my crew will jump in.

Id: [0x002BAB4C]
Soma.

Id: [0x002BAB4D]
Soma.

We all need someone in dark times. Now let's collect Wigmund's head.

Id: [0x002BAB6E]
We have made strides towards an alliance, in fact. A local thegn called Geadric has pledged an oath to me.

Id: [0x002BAB70]
Geadric.

Id: [0x002BAB71]
Geadric.

Id: [0x002BAB72]
Ah, there's a notion. You could chip away at her flag-bearers if you see them, and defend my fyrd if any are in strife.

Id: [0x002BAB73]
They continue their search for the woman, Fulke.

Id: [0x002BAB74]
They continue their search for the woman, Fulke.

Id: [0x002BAB76]
We stole some of her supplies here. If you find any other stores like this, destroy them.

Id: [0x002BAB78]
Is there anything I can do to weaken her grip on the shire? Or make her anxious?

Id: [0x002BAB79]

The waters at Kinder Downfall will soothe my wounds. If my father needs me, I'll be there.

Id: [0x002BABA0]
You bring good luck with you. We could guide the sail-steeds downstream.

Id: [0x002BABAF]
Eivor! Eivor, where are you? Get over here!

Id: [0x002BABB3]
Vili? Where are you? Answer me!

Id: [0x002BABB4]
Vili? Where are you? Answer me!

Id: [0x002BABC8]
So he is. And he'll be pleased as Skoll with the moon in his jaws at the sight of you.

Id: [0x002BABD1]
There you are, come! Ride with me to the falls. They are Freyja's gift to these unforgiving lands.

Id: [0x002BABDF]
Vili was right. The Kinder Downfall is beautiful. Now where is he?

Id: [0x002BABE0]
Vili was right. The Kinder Downfall is beautiful. Now where is he?

We will be at the funeral pyre, overlooking the village.

Id: [0x002BABFD]
We will be at the funeral pyre, overlooking the village.

Id: [0x002BAC01]
Gods, Eivor. Put a stop to this fool's death wish.

Id: [0x002BAC0B]
I must prepare myself for the flames. Body and spirit.

Id: [0x002BAC73]
I would have my son follow in my steps, but he is reluctant. He follows his warrior's heart.

Id: [0x002BAC76]
You have that effect on men. They trust you.

Id: [0x002BAC77]
You have that effect on men. They trust you.

Id: [0x002BAC7E]
Niflheim will have to wait. You are staying here today.

Id: [0x002BAC7F]
[cough]O, thank the All-Father…[cough]

Id: [0x002BACCE]
O, you must try my ale sometime! You must! My abbey brews the best in Cent.

Id: [0x002BACCF]
It certainly sounds worth the risk of my immortal soul.

Id: [0x002BACD0]
Ah, your God is rather a hard taskmaster?

Id: [0x002BACD1]
And your God forbids the mixing of wool and linen. It sounds to me like he's never heard of England.

Id: [0x002BACD2]
[laugh]Not all that is written in the scriptures is God's honest truth.

Id: [0x002BACED]
Once the abbot has Tedmund's gratitude, he will deliver Fulke. It will cost us nothing more than this.

Id: [0x002BACF3]
We hide in plain sight, such is our way. But only until the moment of success. The final strike.

Id: [0x002BACF5]
You don't prefer working in the shadows?

Id: [0x002BACF6]
You don't prefer working in the shadows?

Id: [0x002BACF9]
You see my point. A leader must know when to speak and when to stay silent, for silence is not always a lie.

Id: [0x002BAD06]
Who am I to stand in the light of a boy searching for his balls?

Id: [0x002BAD33]
How did you come to be here?

Id: [0x002BAD34]
How did you come to be here?

Id: [0x002BAD42]
We stand in the shadow of the giant, the great keeper of secrets. Here you'll find a drink of the resounding sea.

Id: [0x002BAD6A]
Hold on to me. I can get you out.

Id: [0x002BAD6B]
Hold on to me. I can get you out.

Id: [0x002BAD6C]
Flee, my friend. We have the man we came for. Does this venture not set your blood ablaze?

Id: [0x002BAD94]
Live? O Saints protect me!

Id: [0x002BAD96]
Silence will save you, Tedmund! Silence, not your saints.

Id: [0x002BAD97]
Silence will save you, Tedmund! Silence, not your saints.

Id: [0x002BAD9A]
Eivor … Your Ladyship … do not mind me. Only here to count my spoils.

Id: [0x002BADA7]
Prepare your bellies!

Id: [0x002BADA9]
Mm-hm.

Id: [0x002BADAA]
So, did you see our king?

Id: [0x002BADB5]
Yes … of course, I … as I say, it is wonderful to have you.

Id: [0x002BADB6]
Yes … of course, I … as I say, it is wonderful to have you.

Id: [0x002BADB7]
Good! Kings love those arm-fetters.

Id: [0x002BADD0]
Yes. Now … now for our little plan. When you see us talking, be quiet as a wood mouse and then surprise him with our gift.

Id: [0x002BADD2]
Good. Tonight, you will be the cord that unites our people. And I'm so proud of you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BADD8]
Get up, Olaf! Stay lucid, friend!

Id: [0x002BADE0]
I am in witness of a love that inspires and empowers. I invite you, now, to speak your vows.

Id: [0x002BADE1]

That ugly bastard's head is mine!

Death has found you, Saxon.

Id: [0x002BAE1E]
Death has found you, Saxon.

Id: [0x002BAE29]
And how does one become a double? Are there vigorous challenges and tests to overcome?

Id: [0x002BAE2A]
I was born with the misfortune of looking like someone else. I should have stayed on God's chosen path.

Id: [0x002BAE2B]
The cloistered life did not suit you?

Id: [0x002BAE2C]
I thought there would be great comfort in repetition. But instead, I found nothing but prayer and backbreaking toil.

Id: [0x002BAE2E]
The Norns weave strange destinies. Now your life depends on the story you weave for yourself.

Because you are wise, and you see the same qualities in me.

His prattle was sad and ugly. Like a weeping babe.

Id: [0x002BAE39]
His prattle was sad and ugly. Like a weeping babe.

And yet I allow you to squeak in my ear. Along all the roads and byways of Cent.

Out, Ivarr! Now.

Out, Ivarr! Now.

Pigs have to eat, my lady. The trouble is, it takes a lot to sate their hunger.

O, God!

[laugh]Dance with me, Eivor!

Only a matter of time before they finish those and sniff around for fresher meat.

Id: [0x002BAE60]
You … do not, sir.

Id: [0x002BAE61]
A wise man is always unexpected.

Id: [0x002BAE65]
Norway.

Id: [0x002BAE66]
Norway.

Id: [0x002BAE6A]
You shit-eating cowards! Call your king and I will settle this now! Then put you in the ground for good measure!

Id: [0x002BAE78]
I will. This small sup of power has got me thinking, perhaps I can be a leader of men?

Id: [0x002BAEA8]
I smell blood on the air.

Id: [0x002BAEA9]
I smell blood on the air.

Id: [0x002BAEAC]
Death is close. Did someone find the scout before me?

Slain by wolves. My work has been done for me.

Somewhere on this road is a scout.

Id: [0x002BAF43]
You will tell no tales to Fulke now.

Id: [0x002BAF44]
You will tell no tales to Fulke now.

Id: [0x002BAF4D]
And what of the captured Danes?

Id: [0x002BAF4E]
You must kill them all! Every last--

Id: [0x002BAF4F]
All right, all right. But if you mean to stay, mind the smell after they finish this.

Id: [0x002BAF5F]
Two days ago, we rid this land of Kjotve and his dogs. Yet today we do not celebrate. Today we cower under a cloud of fear.

Id: [0x002BAF61]
Did you know about your father's oath to Harald?

Id: [0x002BAF62]
I did not. And for that, my anger burns hotter than any man's here. But I will not let that drive me into despair.

Id: [0x002BAF65]
We cannot stay in Norway, not under Harald's boot, not without fueling more war. So we push forward. To newer lands.

Id: [0x002BAF72]
To England! And there make a new home. A kingdom of our own.

Id: [0x002BAF75]
No. That belongs to my father, as a fair compensation. In England, we must start anew.

Id: [0x002BAF76]
You would start us with nothing, in a land we do not know, among people who hate us?

Id: [0x002BAF7A]
Our leaving must not be an assault on my father. It is a time of renewal for us.

Id: [0x002BAF7D]
I have no desire to wear Harald's leash. I like this idea.

Id: [0x002BAF7E]
A saga for the ages, I agree!

Id: [0x002BAF84]
Kjotve's riches would go some way to easing our passage, Sigurd. I bested him. It is within my rights to claim his goods.

Id: [0x002BAF85]
Kjotve's riches would go some way to easing our passage, Sigurd. I bested him. It is within my rights to claim his goods.

Id: [0x002BAF8D]
I abhor such theft. But if this is what it takes to sway you to my cause, I accept.

Id: [0x002BAF90]
If we go, we will need all the help we can get. I say we take Kjotve's spoils for our own.

Id: [0x002BAF91]
If we go, we will need all the help we can get. I say we take Kjotve's spoils for our own.

Id: [0x002BAF92]
Styrbjorn will prosper by the generosity of his new king. Kjotve's goods belong to us.

Styrbjorn will prosper by the generosity of his new king. Kjotve's goods belong to us.

Id: [0x002BAF95]
Good. I did not want this cloud hanging over us. It is a wise leader who considers the need of others.

Id: [0x002BAF96]
If you object, I understand. Let your father keep Kjotve's riches. England will have riches and cargo enough for us.

Id: [0x002BAF97]
If you object, I understand. Let your father keep Kjotve's riches. England will have riches and cargo enough for us.

Id: [0x002BAF98]
To England then, before the day is out. Pack what you need, but no more than that.

Id: [0x002BAF9B]
And tighten your lips. The last thing we need is the attention of Harald's troops.

Id: [0x002BAF9C]
And tighten your lips. The last thing we need is the attention of Harald's troops.

Id: [0x002BAF9D]
Dear God. More death, more war, endless refugees.

Id: [0x002BAF9F]
This is our only way forward, Deorlaf. You know the territory best, how can we hurt them?

Id: [0x002BAFA0]
This is our only way forward, Deorlaf. You know the territory best, how can we hurt them?

Id: [0x002BAFA2]
You … you are asking me to betray my husband! How can I do that?

Id: [0x002BAFA6]
If you don't, you will betray countless others.

Id: [0x002BAFA7]
If you don't, you will betray countless others.

Id: [0x002BAFA8]
But there will be peace. This is Ceolwulf's promise, and it will be honored. You have my word.

Id: [0x002BAFB0]
And the smell of pig shit after this? Hoo!

Id: [0x002BAFB6]
I would not stick around too long. The smell of pig shit after they pass this is something dreadful.

Id: [0x002BAFBC]
Talk now and we'll draw you a nice warm bath.

Id: [0x002BAFBD]
Talk now and we'll draw you a nice warm bath.

The heads were a nice touch. I'm not one for spectacle, but it got her talking.

Id: [0x002BAFC6]
The heads were a nice touch. I'm not one for spectacle, but it got her talking.

How many more times will I have to curtail your spectacles, Ivarr?

How many more times will I have to curtail your spectacles, Ivarr?

Id: [0x002BAFDB]
Good. Need anything else?

Id: [0x002BAFDC]
Is there something else?

Id: [0x002BAFDE]
Sure.

Id: [0x002BAFE0]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x002BAFE2]
A few worth looking at.

Id: [0x002BAFE4]
She is. And she is getting better at it.

Id: [0x002BAFE5]
See you later, Svend.

Id: [0x002BAFE6]
See you later, Svend.

Id: [0x002BAFE7]
Let me have a look.

Id: [0x002BAFE8]

Svend. Have you designed any new tattoos?

Tove says she is trying out some new tattoos.

Id: [0x002BAFEE]
Thank you, Eivor. Now and forever, I am pledged to you.

Id: [0x002BAFF4]
Spectacle? That's just me.

Id: [0x002BAFFA]
Hello, little one! Ready to celebrate this great day?

Id: [0x002BAFFB]
I have a gift for the king. Then I will dance.

Id: [0x002BAFFC]
Raise your horn with me, Tove. Tonight we sleep in the heat of clan-fire. Made happy by mead.

Id: [0x002BAFFD]
Skal, you old skald!

Id: [0x002BB00D]
I was wondering…

Id: [0x002BB00E]
I was wondering…

Id: [0x002BB016]
Hej, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BB023]
Look, Dane, you start a scene or a scuffle and I'll scream for soldiers.

Id: [0x002BB024]
I'm asking a simple question.

Id: [0x002BB025]
I'm asking a simple question.

Id: [0x002BB035]
How did you come to be in Soma's clan?

Id: [0x002BB036]
How did you come to be in Soma's clan?

Id: [0x002BB037]
A vision from a volva set me on this path. It pricked my mind like a splinter, then faded. But I wanted more.

Id: [0x002BB038]
For months, years, I ate only henbane, mushrooms, sacred plants, hoping to see something new.

Id: [0x002BB039]
But my body dwindled. I lived addled, maddened, a wanderer. Taken in by Saxons and spat out … again and again.

Id: [0x002BB03A]
Until Soma found me, naked and alone in the fens. She clothed and cared for me, humbled as I was. I owe her my life.

Id: [0x002BB03C]
The soldiers nabbed Geadric, though. I was sorry to see that. He's well-liked in these parts.

Id: [0x002BB03E]
I know I can seem distant, obsessed. But the gods are with us always. I see it as my duty to shelter Soma from their ire.

Id: [0x002BB040]
A woman who'll stand up for her village, who won't be crushed under the boot of oppression.

Id: [0x002BB041]
A woman who'll stand up for her village, who won't be crushed under the boot of oppression.

Id: [0x002BB07E]
A charred corpse as a reminder of what came to pass here. It already feels like an age gone by. [beat]I wonder who remains.

Id: [0x002BB07F]
A charred corpse as a reminder of what came to pass here. It already feels like an age gone by. [beat]I wonder who remains.

Id: [0x002BB082]
Painful truths are easy to bear when you can laugh, you see? Delight in the face of suffering is an act of rebellion.

Id: [0x002BB085]
Eadwyn vows revenge on the Danes who stole her husband and her livelihood.

Id: [0x002BB086]
And Galinn, he broods like it's an art form. He's got this … self-importance that is just so charming.

Id: [0x002BB089]
That should be the last one! Back to the druid.

Id: [0x002BB08A]
That should be the last one! Back to the druid.

Their mouths are open, like they've been screaming secrets.

A hangman's noose. A knife. And the vial smells of poison. Three ways to kill someone?

Id: [0x002BB090]
A hangman's noose. A knife. And the vial smells of poison. Three ways to kill someone?

Id: [0x002BB09F]
What do you think of the others, Lif and Birna?

Id: [0x002BB0A0]
What do you think of the others, Lif and Birna?

Do you not trust them?

Do you not trust them?

Id: [0x002BB0BB]
We came to England together, sailing under Guthrum. The Great Summer Army the Saxons called us.

Id: [0x002BB0BC]
How did you come to join Soma's army?

Id: [0x002BB0BD]
How did you come to join Soma's army?

Id: [0x002BB0C6]
When Guthrum left for Wessex, Soma stepped forward to lead. Something I would have liked to do myself.

Id: [0x002BB0C8]
I would run the city my own way. I would not give Birna and Galinn's opinions equal weight.

Id: [0x002BB0C9]
A high price for a happy color. I'm certain that's why someone stole my paints some weeks ago. Blasted thief.

Id: [0x002BB0CB]
Ah. Good.

Id: [0x002BB0CC]
He told me.

Id: [0x002BB0CD]
He told me.

Id: [0x002BB0F5]
We are severing the bonds of our marriage.

Id: [0x002BB0F6]
We share a love that is steadfast. And I have faith it will forever be so, but my heart is yours. That much he knows.

Id: [0x002BB0F7]
And I believe he is happy for us.

Id: [0x002BB0F9]
Sigurd's desires are bigger than any man or woman can offer. He longs for something more, something only he can find.

Id: [0x002BB0FC]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x002BB0FD]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x002BB0FE]
All he wants is far, far away. All I need is right here.

Id: [0x002BB0FF]
All he wants is far, far away. All I need is right here.

Id: [0x002BB10F]
We share a love that is steadfast, and I have faith it will forever be so. But it is not the love of a wife and her husband. It was not an easy decision.

Id: [0x002BB114]
I have all I need right here. With you, with our people.

Id: [0x002BB115]
I hope so. And I am pleased for you.

Id: [0x002BB116]
I hope so. And I am pleased for you.

Id: [0x002BB117]
And what about you? What are you looking for?

Id: [0x002BB118]
And what about you? What are you looking for?

Id: [0x002BB11C]
I want to say, Randvi… I love you, and I have for some time.

Id: [0x002BB11D]
I want to say, Randvi… I love you, and I have for some time.

Id: [0x002BB11E]
I did not pursue it, not wanting to betray my brother's trust. But that does not mean I did not desire it. [beat]Does that surprise you?

Id: [0x002BB11F]
I did not pursue it, not wanting to betray my brother's trust. But that does not mean I did not desire it. [beat]Does that surprise you?

Id: [0x002BB121]
I am grateful. So much of our prosperity we owe to you. I hardly know where to begin.

Id: [0x002BB122]
I am grateful. So much of our prosperity we owe to you. I hardly know where to begin.

Id: [0x002BB123]
The hard wood, the tough fabrics, the expensive paints. The yellow I use, for instance … that must be imported.

Id: [0x002BB125]
You were there when Guthrum made Soma the steward of Grantebridge. How did that feel?

Id: [0x002BB126]
You were there when Guthrum made Soma the steward of Grantebridge. How did that feel?

Id: [0x002BB128]
But that is beside the point. Soma is my jarlskona, and I am her sworn man. No act of any god will change that.

Id: [0x002BB138]
It matters to me.

Id: [0x002BB139]
It matters to me.

Id: [0x002BB13C]
(groan)

Id: [0x002BB13D]
(groan)

Id: [0x002BB13F]
Ignore him. Desperate pleas and prophecies, nothing more.

Id: [0x002BB140]
Ignore him. Desperate pleas and prophecies, nothing more.

Id: [0x002BB141]
Walk with me, Wolf-Kissed. We have some time before the ceremony.

Id: [0x002BB143]
Finnr, our steward. To our guests of honor, Brothir and Broder, and to my lovely bride-to-be, Valdis.

Id: [0x002BB146]
Do I bore you, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002BB147]
I'm sorry, did you say something?

Id: [0x002BB148]
I'm sorry, did you say something?

Id: [0x002BB15D]
How? You've been trapped here for a millennium. Eivor put you here.

Id: [0x002BB15F]
Indeed. But I'm not alone in this place. Not always. I have a friend who helps me. Together we read the calculations.

Id: [0x002BB160]
After we located Eivor's probable resting place, I contacted you.

Id: [0x002BB175]
But sir, I'm told Halfdan can't read.

Id: [0x002BB177]
Yet my people suffer day by day--

Id: [0x002BB178]
Your people? Do you rule a shadow kingdom under my nose?

Id: [0x002BB179]
Our people suffer from these brutal winter raids.

Id: [0x002BB17A]
I will attend to her soon, I promise. But Halfdan needs me now.

Id: [0x002BB1BE]
I'll live. But my men…

Id: [0x002BB1DD]
If we die today, tonight we drink with Odin.

Id: [0x002BB1E9]
For Thor!

Id: [0x002BB1EB]
For Ragnar!

Id: [0x002BB1ED]
For Halfdan!

Id: [0x002BB233]
It will open your mind to the secrets of the world.

Id: [0x002BB236]
Then we chase them like hounds!

Id: [0x002BB238]
They flee like rabbits!

Id: [0x002BB239]
They flee like rabbits!

Id: [0x002BB23D]
Be thankful it was me who took your Mead and not Loki. What I do, I do for the safety of the Aesir and Vanir.

Id: [0x002BB23E]
Be thankful it was me who took your Mead and not Loki. What I do, I do for the safety of the Aesir and Vanir.

Id: [0x002BB245]
Leave him! The day is already won!

Id: [0x002BB246]
Leave him! The day is already won!

Id: [0x002BB267]
You brought this on yourself, old man. Too stubborn to know when enough is enough.

Id: [0x002BB268]
Ah ah! Fight me one at a time, if you have any balls!

Id: [0x002BB269]
You threatened the king's life. Now, you'll pay the price.

Id: [0x002BB278]
Shall we find our way back to the wedding? Brigid might give another speech. We must not miss that.

Id: [0x002BB27F]
Gods, I worried you saw me as a woman starved for the affection of her husband. That it was loneliness driving me.

Id: [0x002BB280]
But it was you, Eivor. Only you. Everything you are, everything you will become.

Id: [0x002BB290]
Randvi … without you I would have lost my way, a thousand times.

Id: [0x002BB291]
Randvi … without you I would have lost my way, a thousand times.

Id: [0x002BB307]
And here, a gift, for retaking Grantebridge with us. One of the few things I have left from my blood family.

Id: [0x002BB30B]
Really. I find she speaks beautifully. With poetry, even.

Id: [0x002BB30D]
Am I?

Id: [0x002BB30F]
Come, we should go.

Id: [0x002BB310]
About that … I have not understood a single word of hers since Glowecestrescire!

Id: [0x002BB311]
About that … I have not understood a single word of hers since Glowecestrescire!

Id: [0x002BB312]
Are you kidding?

Id: [0x002BB313]
Are you kidding?

Id: [0x002BB319]
I give you my word that it will always be so. I'm happiest by your side and in your company.

Id: [0x002BB31D]
You are my truest friend, Randvi. My right hand. My greatest ally.

Id: [0x002BB31E]
You are my truest friend, Randvi. My right hand. My greatest ally.

Id: [0x002BB322]
Settled at last. At home in my skin. With nothing urgent pushing me forward. A strange feeling.

Id: [0x002BB323]
Settled at last. At home in my skin. With nothing urgent pushing me forward. A strange feeling.

Id: [0x002BB324]
A part of me wishes that Sigurd were here, if only to see how far we have taken his original dream.

Id: [0x002BB325]
A part of me wishes that Sigurd were here, if only to see how far we have taken his original dream.

Id: [0x002BB328]
Have care you do not enjoy taking orders from anyone but your jarl back home. I fight for Sigurd, none else.

Id: [0x002BB32B]
While you're on this ship, Dag, you fight for me. And for Soma's loyalty, we fight for her.

Id: [0x002BB32C]
While you're on this ship, Dag, you fight for me. And for Soma's loyalty, we fight for her.

Id: [0x002BB32D]
Do not worry yourself over his absence.

Id: [0x002BB32E]
Sigurd's desires are bigger than any man or woman can offer. He longs for something more, something only he can find.

Id: [0x002BB330]
You're right. He is searching for what he desires most of all. And I have all I desire here beside me.

Id: [0x002BB331]
You're right. He's searching for what he desires most of all. And I have all I desire here beside me.

Id: [0x002BB335]
Nor will many in my kingdom. Burgred's soldiers will stand tall in the face of this turmoil, all across Mercia, against us.

Id: [0x002BB33B]
Good. I can ride with you as far as the river Nene. You may find your way from there.

Id: [0x002BB342]
Do not trouble yourself with Sigurd's absence. He is where he wishes to be, searching for a newer purpose.

Id: [0x002BB343]
I have made peace with that. And though I miss him, I feel great joy knowing that he is alive and well, somewhere in the world.

Id: [0x002BB345]
My place is here. In this settlement, by your side.

Id: [0x002BB346]
And what about you? Have you found what you seek?

Id: [0x002BB347]
And what about you? Have you found what you seek?

Id: [0x002BB348]
I never told him outright, but I doubt he will be surprised. I think he may have suspected it even. Some time ago.

Id: [0x002BB34A]
He is more observant than I often give him credit for. I believe he sees us as we are. And as we hope to be.

Id: [0x002BB34C]
We can wait to tell him. Give it a few days, when the feasting is over and everything is settled.

Id: [0x002BB34E]
The blink of an eye.

Id: [0x002BB350]
If he suspected it, he never said anything.

Id: [0x002BB351]
If he suspected it, he never said anything.

Id: [0x002BB354]
Agreed. I have waited long enough for you, and you for me. What is another few days?

Id: [0x002BB355]
Agreed. I have waited long enough for you, and you for me. What is another few days?

Id: [0x002BB36C]
Sigurd Whoreson! You slink around my walls like a thief in the night! Face me here, now!

Id: [0x002BB370]
Look at this! Once again, Eivor Wolf-Kissed appears to take a swipe at me!

Id: [0x002BB374]
I will make you beg as your father begged, Wolf-Kissed! Squeal as your mother squealed!

Id: [0x002BB377]
This … this is my father's shame! Today I take back the honor he lost.

Id: [0x002BB378]
This … this is my father's shame! Today I take back the honor he lost.

Id: [0x002BB379]
I know I have been a cock. But you are a good fighter, I respect that. Let it be said that Ivarr the Boneless considers Eivor a friend.

Id: [0x002BB37C]
Who calls you "boneless"?

Id: [0x002BB37D]
Who calls you "boneless"?

Id: [0x002BB381]
A fitting end for a Ragnarsson.

Wigmund took you from us long before I ever raised my blade. Clear the body.

Id: [0x002BB389]
He believed too much in fate. And not enough in us. Take him away.

Id: [0x002BB3AC]
Shaun, what do you make of the grave out there?

Id: [0x002BB3AD]
Well, it overturns a few hundred years of scholarship about the first Europeans to set foot in North America.

Id: [0x002BB3AE]
Apart from that, it's just a bunch of muddy bones, isn't it?

Id: [0x002BB3AF]
Can we talk about this thing on my neck for a second?

Id: [0x002BB3B0]
Ah. The mood stabilizer. Yes.

Id: [0x002BB3B1]
It's not harmful, is it? I mean, I feel good. But I want to make sure there's no … side effects.

Id: [0x002BB3B2]
There shouldn't be. It's only blocking outside signals, a passive effect. So the staff doesn't, you know … mess with you.

Id: [0x002BB3B3]
Shaun, what happened last year, I-- … I had no control over that. I … I tried to resist.

Id: [0x002BB3B4]
I understand. And your old team … maybe they don't, but we've seen that sort of thing before.

Id: [0x002BB3B5]
Still, if you want to work with us and get to the bottom of why the world is about to end for the second time in eight years…

Id: [0x002BB3B6]
…then you wear that thing until we say otherwise. William's orders.

Id: [0x002BB3B7]
I know. It's not a problem.

Id: [0x002BB3B8]
It's just a few more weeks, yeah? Just until we figure this out.

Id: [0x002BB3B9]
You're right. I know you're right.

Id: [0x002BB3BA]
Hello, Layla.

Id: [0x002BB3BB]
Better. But I'm worried that it could happen again, the two data streams.

Id: [0x002BB3BC]
I can't promise it won't. I barely understand it myself.

Id: [0x002BB3BD]
It felt like … two minds. Fighting over one brain. It hurt, like a shotgun to the head.

Id: [0x002BB3BE]
Right. There's something about this Viking's DNA sample that feels dense … noisy.

Id: [0x002BB3BF]
Could it be the staff? Interfering somehow?

Id: [0x002BB3C0]
How do you mean?

Id: [0x002BB3C1]
My headaches, my temper. They started the day I got that thing.

Id: [0x002BB3C2]
I hope you're not making excuses for, you know … your friend.

Id: [0x002BB3C3]
Jesus, no. I'm not.

Id: [0x002BB3C5]
Sorry. Just … take it easy. And if you feel yourself slipping again, let us know.

Id: [0x002BB3C6]
I'm trying. I really am.

Id: [0x002BB3C7]
Feeling okay?

Id: [0x002BB3CC]
To grow old and fat on a farm somewhere, with little Ubbas to chase about.

Id: [0x002BB3D1]
You can steal all the silver and gold you want. But if there are no more farmers in the field to hire, it's useless metal.

Go ahead.

Id: [0x002BB3E9]
At peace…

Id: [0x002BB3EA]

…we rest.

We killed the wrong warrior, Eivor. A terrible truth that tastes of soot and ashes.

Id: [0x002BB401]
Do not think I blame you. I held the blade. The decision was my own. Now I must explain myself to my people.

Id: [0x002BB405]
I should have guessed it was Galinn. If I'd trusted my instincts, if I had dealt with all this alone, or discovered him sooner…

Id: [0x002BB40A]
That's how I feel. Exactly.

Id: [0x002BB40E]
And does its difficulty make it more valuable?

Id: [0x002BB411]
It's the life of anyone with sense.

Id: [0x002BB414]
Thank you for standing at my side in this. You have my oath and my arm in the battles to come, Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002BB419]
The cost of war is always high, and victory can be sour. But you have your city back. And Wigmund is dead.

As may be all trust in me. After all, why should any trust me if I cannot trust my closest friends?

Id: [0x002BB43C]
We'll twist the truth from him.

Id: [0x002BB440]
I have explained enough. Now is the time for action.

Id: [0x002BB442]
You've done nothing of the sort. Nothing but give me your blind word!

Id: [0x002BB443]

Come and drink! Let us amuse the gods!

Of course it's a kind of a dog! Listen to that sound! Awoooo! Pure dog.

No prisoners! No mercy!

Id: [0x002BBCB3]
[battle-crazed-laugh]Raise your blade to me! Fucking try it!

Id: [0x002BBCB9]
Light your torches and set your arrow tips ablaze, Eivor. The red enemy of the branch will make quick work of this place.

Id: [0x002BBCBD]
We are a curse, visited upon them all!

Id: [0x002BBCDD]
Bring their heads to Ealdorman Wigmund!

Id: [0x002BBCE4]
Ah. The smell of burning roof thatch and heady turf fire.

Id: [0x002BBCE5]
Ah. The smell of burning roof thatch and a heady turf fire.

Id: [0x002BBCE6]
These Saxons could have supported Soma and her grand idea for Grantebridge. But they fed and outfitted Wigmund's army instead.

Id: [0x002BBCE7]
We are here.

Id: [0x002BBCE9]
Nothing like the column of fire smoke smeared across the sky.

This priest blows as much air as a hailstorm! He cannot be allowed to keep spewing.

Id: [0x002BBCF2]
How kind. Now keep your voice down.

Id: [0x002BBCF3]
How kind. Now keep your voice down.

The hair gets longer, the nails grow, even when the corpse is cold. I've seen it myself.

Her wounds are severe, but not seeping. She will heal.

Don't get too close. I might black your eye or bruise your head.

The markets are up and running again. Soma doesn't waste time.

Id: [0x002BBD23]
The markets are up and running again. Soma doesn't waste time.

Id: [0x002BBD2C]
Now this is how I like it! None of this skulking around nonsense!

Id: [0x002BBD2E]
You know, I would much prefer a more straightforward approach. But for you, I'll try something new.

Id: [0x002BBD31]
Well, well. I may be a heathen in the Saxons' eyes, but this church is lovely. I know good craftsmanship when I see it.

Id: [0x002BBD33]
Ah! Look at this structure? The trees they must have hewn, the devices they must have used to lift stone! Solid work.

Id: [0x002BBD36]
No! Never! Can't a crafstman drool over … other … crafts?

Id: [0x002BBD37]
Are you in the midst of a conversion, Lif? Shall I steal a small cross for you as well?

Id: [0x002BBD38]
Are you in the midst of a conversion, Lif? Shall I steal a small cross for you as well?

Id: [0x002BBD39]
Heel, Beonton! We're going for a walk, down to the temple.

Id: [0x002BBD3B]
You think, what, there's a bit of life left in someone long dead?

Id: [0x002BBD3C]
No, it's the fumes in a body. Odors grow after a killing, so they have to escape by any means they can.

Id: [0x002BBD3F]
Fighting beside you should bring a thrill. Happy I can see it up close.

Id: [0x002BBD40]
[laugh]You'd lose your elbow before the bruises showed.

Id: [0x002BBD41]
Here, a hidden entrance. They might be lurking below.

Id: [0x002BBD44]
[laughing]Come get your porridge, boys!

Id: [0x002BBD47]
A heavy blade hand, but a footfall as soft as lambswool.

Id: [0x002BBD48]
So is lightning, but that doesn't make it subtle.

Id: [0x002BBD4A]
Come, boy! I'll wear your jaw like a crown!

Id: [0x002BBD4C]
You're light on your feet and quick through the grass.

Id: [0x002BBD4D]
I practiced by sneaking in and out of bedroom windows, every chance I had.

Id: [0x002BBD4F]
Fighters, to me! Give these Saxons something to play with besides their cocks!

Id: [0x002BBD50]
Is that right? It explains much!

Id: [0x002BBD52]
You've made more noise than Ragnarok's end, and these Saxons still don't see you.

Id: [0x002BBD53]
More's the pity.

Id: [0x002BBD55]
Ah, the solitude of after-slaughter. Shame about the smell, though. Men shitting themselves.

Id: [0x002BBD57]
After all that has happened … what if Soma is just cursed with bad luck?

Id: [0x002BBD58]
Soma has only ever pleased the gods. Deserting her now, breaking your oath, that is what will bring us ill luck.

Id: [0x002BBD67]
Now she's taken up her husband's fight, with the promise of aid from King Aelfred of Wessex.

Id: [0x002BBD70]
These pipes burst and flooded the tunnel.

Id: [0x002BBD71]
These pipes burst and flooded the tunnel.

Id: [0x002BBD7B]
A gift for us. You track them through the cave, we'll circle around back and snare any who try to slip away.

Id: [0x002BBD80]
Even this old Roman work cannot withstand the icy kiss of winter's goddess.

Id: [0x002BBD92]
They'll tell the chief!

They'll tell the chief!

Stop them! Before they reach Stenwege!

Paying a visit to our kept King Ricsige, long may he reign.

Id: [0x002BBDA4]
I haven't enough men to beat the Picts alone. But with Ricsige and his fyrd, we'll finish them off.

Id: [0x002BBDA6]
What are we doing in Jorvik? You haven't said.

Id: [0x002BBDA7]
What are we doing in Jorvik? You haven't said.

I did not agree to this level of deception. You should have told me this before.

What is all this?

What is all this?

Id: [0x002BBDC1]
Enough to pay for an army.

I hope the day finds you and Jorvik well.

Basim is secretive by nature. But he is wise and forthright. And he has opened my eyes to a magnificent truth.

Id: [0x002BBE1A]
He has promised me a reward so unusual, so incredible, it will shatter your mind to shards.

Id: [0x002BBE1C]
He has the look of one who trusts none but himself.

Id: [0x002BBE1D]

Id: [0x002BBE1F]
Do not let Basim and his prophecies of good fortune sway you from our simple goal.

Id: [0x002BBE20]
It's a good longship, but powerfully ugly. Why's it splashed all yellow like that?

Id: [0x002BBE26]
But Basim has a deep insight. He's read wisdom in the lines of my face and heard the litany of my forefathers, and…

Id: [0x002BBE27]
Well, there will be time enough for my saga later.

Id: [0x002BBE29]
Clap your mead hole, Geadric. Lapdog of the Danes.

Id: [0x002BBE2A]
You'll sell us out to Wessex! And that poxy-assed bastard Aelfred! We won't 'ave it!

Id: [0x002BBE2B]
These soldiers, always leave a bleedin' mess.

Id: [0x002BBE2C]
I think they were messengers. Didn't think anything of it since they weren't coming here.

Id: [0x002BBE2E]
Galinn's longship … he painted it yellow so the Saxons would know not to attack him. Argr (cowardly) trickster.

Eivor. Are you ready to begin the assault, now?

Id: [0x002BBE38]
Sigurd, are you cracked?

Id: [0x002BBE39]
Sigurd, are you cracked?

Id: [0x002BBE3E]
We'll be ready.

Id: [0x002BBE3F]
I'll return when I've destroyed enough of Eadwyn's men and supplies.

Id: [0x002BBE40]
I'll return when I've destroyed enough of Eadwyn's men and supplies.

Id: [0x002BBE41]
Lightning tingles my blood, Eivor! I hear the voices of my slaughtered people on the air, calling Wigmund's name.

Id: [0x002BBE43]
As you say, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BBE44]
Maintain the fyrd. I'll return when the time is right.

Id: [0x002BBE45]
Maintain the fyrd. I'll return when the time is right.

Id: [0x002BBE47]
Good. An' let's be quick about it. My scouts tell me a force of King Aelfred's men is on the march.

Id: [0x002BBE48]
We are ready. Give the command.

Id: [0x002BBE49]
We are ready. Give the command.

Id: [0x002BBE4D]
Hey! What is this?

Id: [0x002BBE50]
Prophecy, Eivor. Not hope.

Id: [0x002BBE51]
She has her way, they'll be dead by supper!

Id: [0x002BBE96]
My husband should be home today. The last we heard, he was approaching Stavanger.

Id: [0x002BBE9A]
Ah! After so many years. You should take it to Gunnar. He will give it back its edge.

Id: [0x002BBE9C]
That I do not advise, not yet. He is meeting with a messenger from the North.

Id: [0x002BBEA4]
Memories of past agonies. Of sadness and pain.

Id: [0x002BBEAA]
They rarely go as planned, but we killed many of Kjotve's warriors. And there was this … my father's axe among the dead.

Id: [0x002BBEAB]

I should speak with Valka. She could help me make sense of my … feelings.

Id: [0x002BBEB5]
I should speak with Valka. She could help me make sense of my … my feelings.

Id: [0x002BBEBA]
I was desperate to fight. You should have freed me!

Id: [0x002BBEBC]
An ally, Eivor. A most important ally. A holy woman who trades in prophecies and secret knowledge.

Id: [0x002BBEBE]
Because I am alive, Eivor. My heart's alight with the fuel of battle-fire. Like old times, hey?

Id: [0x002BBEBF]
We brought it down together. The arrows from our bows, like darts of ice.

Id: [0x002BBEC3]
Who is this Fulke that Basim spoke of?

Id: [0x002BBEC4]
Who is this Fulke that Basim spoke of?

That is not the sort of alliance we're looking for, Sigurd.

That is not the sort of alliance we're looking for, Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BBEC9]
Damn her to Hell, the harpy escaped!

Id: [0x002BBECB]
Patience, Eivor. Patience.

Id: [0x002BBED4]
The door is barred. No point in knocking.

Id: [0x002BBED8]
Understood. I will come back.

Id: [0x002BBED9]
Understood. I'll come back.

Id: [0x002BBEDF]
I hope he likes the view. It's the last he'll ever see.

Id: [0x002BBEE0]
I hope he likes the view. It's the last he'll ever see.

He doesn't leave this monastery alive.

He doesn't leave this monastery alive.

Id: [0x002BBEE5]
Good Lord, you fight well. Thank you for that.

Id: [0x002BBEE6]
Geadric, this is Eivor. My stone-armed sibling.

Id: [0x002BBEE7]
Well met.

Id: [0x002BBEEB]
Galinn? What are you doing?

Id: [0x002BBEEC]
Galinn? What are you doing?

Id: [0x002BBF04]
I am Thegn Holt. Does Geadric live?

Id: [0x002BBF05]
God in Heaven knows, I'd sooner see a Dane married to my daughter than sell a man of Wessex one of my pigs.

Id: [0x002BBF06]
If Geadric is behind you, then I am too.

Id: [0x002BBF09]
One of Kjotve's men. I need to be careful.

Id: [0x002BBF0A]
One of Kjotve's men. I need to be careful.

Id: [0x002BBF0B]
Kjotve's warriors. I should stay out of sight.

Id: [0x002BBF0C]
Kjotve's warriors. I should stay out of sight.

Id: [0x002BBF0F]
Let the wind from your lungs breathe life back into my city.

Id: [0x002BBF12]
They will have the lost souls of the dead to answer to.

Id: [0x002BBF15]
Old dogs die slow, Wigmund! You can't delay your fate!

Id: [0x002BBF16]
I'm going to skin him alive. On sight.

Id: [0x002BBF17]
My blade bays for your life, Wigmund!

Id: [0x002BBF18]
I will tear his throat from his neck with my teeth.

Id: [0x002BBF19]
How dare you Danes befoul my lands?

Id: [0x002BBF25]
She claims to have seen or spoken with God himself, and for this Lady Eadwyn had her imprisoned, I know not where.

Id: [0x002BBF26]
At a monastery, I suppose. We should make inquiries.

Id: [0x002BBF2A]
That traitor is lost in Hel by now.

Id: [0x002BBF2E]
The sound of the horn means prosperity, long life, bounty.

Id: [0x002BBF30]
Why not? You were the keystone to this attack. You turned the tide.

Id: [0x002BBF31]
Why me?

Id: [0x002BBF32]
Why me?

Id: [0x002BBF38]
Bring this news to Geadric. And tell him we'll be ready when he calls.

Id: [0x002BBF63]
[grunting]Untie me, cowards!

Id: [0x002BBF64]
Get me out of here. Eadwyn will have me flayed alive.

Id: [0x002BBF66]
Ah. No soldiers here now. Geadric's cleared them all out.

Id: [0x002BBF67]
Ah. No soldiers here now. Geadric's cleared them all out.

Id: [0x002BBF68]
She's well supplied, that's for certain. Well done capturing these, lad.

Id: [0x002BBF6B]
Did you find your brother, then?

Id: [0x002BBF6F]
How do we charm her when she's in our care? Do we say what we're after? Or do we dance around the idea?

Id: [0x002BBF70]
From what I've learned about Fulke, she's not shy about sharing her esoterica. If we ask her one question, she'll answer ten.

Id: [0x002BBF73]
Here's the monastery. Saint Albanes.

Id: [0x002BBF74]
Fulke is held inside. Somewhere well protected.

Id: [0x002BBF77]
See that our fletchers have arrows enough for everyone. Twenty to a man.

Id: [0x002BBF78]
Bring those men here. In formation.

Id: [0x002BBF84]
Burn, prophets of deception!

Id: [0x002BBF88]
Let your plague-ridden body feed my fields. Eivor, to me.

Id: [0x002BBF8B]
Never you mind about me, Eivor. Go occupy yourself with Eadwyn's supplies!

Id: [0x002BBF8E]
Look lads, there's Eivor.

Id: [0x002BBF8F]
We're with you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BBF9A]
What are you saying? [to Sigurd]We gave Geadric our word!

Id: [0x002BBF9B]
What are you saying? [to Sigurd]We gave Geadric our word!

Id: [0x002BBFA0]
Yield to us! Give us what we are owed! The trade, the riches, the legacy. All of it!

Id: [0x002BBFA5]
Remember your place, Eivor. Or nothing good will come of all this.

Id: [0x002BBFA7]
A coward's answer!

Id: [0x002BBFA8]
A coward's answer!

Id: [0x002BBFA9]
It was your plan all along, yet you saw fit to keep me guessing through your fits of madness.

Id: [0x002BBFAA]
It was your plan all along, yet you saw fit to keep me guessing through your fits of madness.

Id: [0x002BBFAB]
You are not always to be trusted. Your passions overcome you. I know that. My father knew that.

Id: [0x002BBFAD]
This quarrel with your brother is something to behold. Has it always been so heated?

Id: [0x002BBFAF]
Yet it's possible his line of kings was fathered by a god? In ages past?

Id: [0x002BBFB0]
Sigurd is only a man, the son of a king, and my brother. He may think highly of himself, but he's no god.

Id: [0x002BBFB1]
Sigurd is only a man, the son of a king, and my brother. He may think highly of himself, but he's no god.

Id: [0x002BBFB2]
I see visions of burning men. The screams of soldiers aflame.

Id: [0x002BBFB4]
Geadric.

Id: [0x002BBFB5]
Geadric.

Id: [0x002BBFB8]
Sigurd is the only man you need. He's worth more than twenty other men. He is the son of a king.

Id: [0x002BBFC0]
You had no real cause to frighten me. I'd'a told you where they'd gone, if you'd done me some sweet talk.

Id: [0x002BBFC2]
I shouldn't'a made you pay. But the silver's been well spent. I've used actual barley for the ale, this batch.

Id: [0x002BBFC4]
I'm well ashamed I almost made you pay. But it all worked out right, didn't it?

Id: [0x002BBFC9]
Break this bleedin' cage open, would ya?

Id: [0x002BBFCB]
Friend, get me out of here before they have my head.

Id: [0x002BBFCD]
It was bloody business.

Id: [0x002BBFCF]
Good. But we mustn't seem eager. She could use it against us.

Id: [0x002BBFD4]
Hush, Eivor. Our sacrifice must find its way into the ears of the gods.

Id: [0x002BBFD5]
Brother.

Id: [0x002BBFD6]
Brother.

Id: [0x002BBFDC]
God above. Will we never be ready?

Id: [0x002BBFE0]
You've been foolish, Sigurd. Scampering about like a bewildered child.

Id: [0x002BBFE1]
You've been foolish, Sigurd. Scampering about like a bewildered child.

Id: [0x002BBFE4]
When the battle is won, we will speak at length. Not before.

Id: [0x002BBFE6]
Time has passed and our blood has simmered. Will you talk with me?

Id: [0x002BBFE7]
Time has passed and our blood has simmered. Will you talk with me?

Id: [0x002BBFE9]
My difference is what is at stake here. My difference is all that matters.

Id: [0x002BBFEA]
We both fight for the same end, do we not? Let us put our differences behind us, Brother.

Id: [0x002BBFEB]
We both fight for the same end, do we not? Let us put our differences behind us, Brother.

Id: [0x002BBFED]
You don't believe that. I know you don't.

Id: [0x002BBFEE]
You don't believe that. I know you don't.

Id: [0x002BBFEF]
Don't wield your jaw-lightning over me. I asked for quiet.

Id: [0x002BBFF3]
And I refused it.

Id: [0x002BBFF4]
And I refused it.

Id: [0x002BBFF9]
Those castle walls won't be thick enough to stop us!

Id: [0x002BBFFB]
Are we prepared for the assault?

Id: [0x002BBFFC]
Are we prepared for the assault?

Id: [0x002BC015]
I'll move towards Cyne Belle Castle and bring up the fyrd for an assault. Eadwyn's fortress is strong and sure.

Id: [0x002BC016]
He seems to think she will help us chase Eadwyn to an early grave. But I do not understand how.

Id: [0x002BC017]
He seems to think she will help us chase Eadwyn to an early grave. But I do not understand how.

Id: [0x002BC019]
I'm touched that you would ask.

Id: [0x002BC01A]
I'm touched that you would ask.

Id: [0x002BC01D]
I'll return soon.

Id: [0x002BC01E]
I'll return soon.

Id: [0x002BC023]
This is our moment, Eivor. After this, everything changes.

Id: [0x002BC027]
Eivor. There was a time when you would follow me without question, because we trusted one another.

Id: [0x002BC029]
Because you knew I would never lead you into folly. Never wager our lives before I knew the cost.

Then go with this. A sign of friendship. A bond between our clans and a symbol of the pain and suffering it took to win the peace.

Id: [0x002BC0DD]
No more. Leave me.

Halfdan. It's time I go.

Old friend, do you remember the days we raced our horses across the length of this land?

Id: [0x002BC0E9]
You were always faster, you always won. Because I let you win, my jarl. So I will let you win one last time.

We will meet once more. In the corpse hall.

We are the Sons of Hymir. We have come to claim what is ours!

Id: [0x002BC11E]
Yes, evil persists. Because he gave us free will.

Id: [0x002BC12A]
The instruments of the children of Saklas the Fool, yes I am. I have many such curiosities.

For your so-called heresies?

Id: [0x002BC138]
Heresies, yes. I have been blessed to discover many profane objects in my lifetime.

Id: [0x002BC14B]
Not today. The fish aren't biting. Too many passing boats churning the water.

Id: [0x002BC14D]
Shooting fish with a bow? That could work.

You want to settle things with Basim, you call a holmgang.

Id: [0x002BC172]
Yes. Have a look in the mountains between Fornburg and Stavenger. I have heard stories of a great elk that wanders there.

Id: [0x002BC173]
Will that do?

Id: [0x002BC174]
Will that do?

Id: [0x002BC197]
I will shadow them. They shall not get away.

By all the gods, Basim, what was that?

By all the gods, Basim, what was that?

I could, but I don't want every iron-foot with a bow scaring away the game.

Objects which attest to the works of the demiurge, the false god worshiped by these robed imbeciles.

Lady Eadwyn claims they are blasphemous. But her mind is clouded. The true worth of these objects is immense.

I would indeed. Where you go, I will follow.

May the fire of the Archons consume you!

Cut them down, Eivor.

You came because I called you, Eivor. They spoke through me.

The Roman Church has been deluded by the lies of Saklas, or Ialdabaoth, the demiurge of many names. A lesser god.

Id: [0x002BC1E4]
Saklas and his kind were wise in their time, but they lost sight of the true God, the Self-Begotten One, Lord of the Treasury of Light.

Your father knew it.

You move with the wrath of Odin, but you do not have his wisdom.

I'll go now.

You fought well today, Fulke. Would you fight beside me now?

Id: [0x002BC28E]
You fought well today, Fulke. Would you fight beside me now?

Id: [0x002BC290]
Excellent. My men are itching to attack the fortress, but we'd be fools to force it now.

Her springalds'd cut us to bloody stumps, before they poured boiling oil upon us like a summer tempest!

Never mind.

Never mind.

And have you laid poles of hazel and composed your poems for the coming victory?

Aye, there is old magic here. [hardening]Old magic that would be snuffed out by Tewdwr and his Church.

It's funny, as a child I thought of snow as the tears of God, frozen by our sins.

For the first time, someone extended a hand, showed me kindness. Compassion.

No, no. Quite the opposite.

What a perfect sentence.

I'll ask more simply. Could your brother be descended of the gods? Or could he be a god himself?

Something wrong?

Yes, but the words are … fogged. Shadowed, and yet I … I feel their meaning.

No. This is real. This is everything.

Their tears must be the only remorse to water these fields.

Id: [0x002BC784]
You stamped and roared like fiery Surtr himself, marching through the flames of Muspelheim. I'll see you back home, drengr (courageous warrior).

Id: [0x002BC807]
As I understand, King Aelfred, your name is not spoken with affection here in Mercia.

Id: [0x002BC808]
Yet I am close enough to Wessex to hear myself praised from morn 'til twilight.

Id: [0x002BC809]
Return to your singing subjects then! And leave the affairs of Mercia to the Danes.

Id: [0x002BC80A]
Not 'til your pagan war songs are safely out of hearing.

Id: [0x002BC810]
Please. No secrets here.

Id: [0x002BC812]
Let's end this here, my lord. Let's exchange men. My best warrior for yours, to prove peace.

Id: [0x002BC813]
After which, you leave Mercia, and we fall back north of river Ouse.

Id: [0x002BC817]
These terms are fair. Wolfrich! My war thane, you will go with Geadric, brother. Name your man.

Id: [0x002BC819]
Sigurd Jarl. I offer myself…

Id: [0x002BC81A]
Thank you, Basim.

Id: [0x002BC81C]
King Aelfred! Wait.

Id: [0x002BC81D]
Paladin Fulke? Are you with this company?

Id: [0x002BC81E]
I was, my lord. To recover from Eadwyn what was mine by right.

Id: [0x002BC820]
And his heresies are profound, my lord. He claims to be a living god.

Id: [0x002BC825]
My wife calmed her some, and we set her up in the convent. Seemed well enough to me that she devote herself to the Almighty.

Id: [0x002BC826]
She walked the paths, helped the poor, had a knack with flowers. Raised blue rosemary, red and yellow pansies. Rue.

Id: [0x002BC85F]
One evening, me wife goes to take her some soup. Found the convent guard stabbed dead by a sharpened crucifix. Eadwyn gone.

Id: [0x002BC860]
Wondering now if her despair was all a ruse. A plot to escape. If so, I figure she's fled to Aelfred.

Id: [0x002BC862]
If she is, I'll be ready to fight.

Id: [0x002BC863]
I hope you're wrong, my friend.

Id: [0x002BC864]
I hope you're wrong, my friend.

Id: [0x002BC87F]
Traitorous snake!

Id: [0x002BC881]
I'll gift myself to you, King Aelfred, 'cause it is not my fate to die by your hand.

Id: [0x002BC887]
I'll gut you, troll-woman!

Id: [0x002BC888]
I'll gut you, troll-woman!

Id: [0x002BC889]
None. We gave her a cloak and three loaves of bread and drove her out onto the heath. God knows what became of her.

Id: [0x002BC88B]
They deserve each other.

Id: [0x002BC88C]
God be with ye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BC88D]
I wondered if you've heard any news of what became of the exiled Eadwyn.

Id: [0x002BC88E]
I wondered if you'd heard any news of what became of the exiled Eadwyn.

Id: [0x002BC88F]
Perhaps she made her way to Aelfred.

Id: [0x002BC890]
Perhaps she has made her way to Aelfred.

Id: [0x002BC891]
Farewell, Geadric.

Id: [0x002BC892]
Farewell, Geadric.

Id: [0x002BC894]
O, I did not mean to offend. In any case, I do have a tattoo for you.

Id: [0x002BC897]
A kind offer, but I want this scar visible.

Id: [0x002BC898]
A kind offer, but I want this scar visible.

Id: [0x002BC8B1]
This man is dangerous, my lord. Let me hold him.

Id: [0x002BC8B2]
Do what you must. But treat him with care.

Id: [0x002BC8B5]
I don't keep track of the comings and goings of the aetheling. Ask another.

Id: [0x002BC8B7]
Have you seen Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002BC8B8]
Have you seen Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002BC8BA]
Last I saw, he was sharpening arrow heads.

Id: [0x002BC8BC]
I'm looking for Ceolbert, have you seen him?

Id: [0x002BC8BD]
I'm looking for Ceolbert, have you seen him?

Id: [0x002BCA1A]
I'll meet you at Stenwege.

Id: [0x002BCA1E]
We did wrong to follow Ulf and would make things right by following you this day.

Id: [0x002BCA21]
Today you may regain your glory. Think on that.

Id: [0x002BCA22]
Today you may regain your glory. Think on that.

Id: [0x002BCA2F]
Odin be with you, Eivor. I'll make the necessary preparations.

Id: [0x002BCA7C]
Not me, friend. My name is Thokk.

Id: [0x002BCA7D]
Loki?

Id: [0x002BCA7E]
Loki?

Id: [0x002BCA88]
You are reckless, Hyrrokin. Midgard is no crucible for your experiments.

Id: [0x002BCA89]
No, indeed. It is as a great barn, swollen with vermin, bulging at the gables.

Id: [0x002BCA8C]
You underestimate the humans. You always did. When the end comes, they will outlive us.

Id: [0x002BCA8D]
They are mindless ravagers, who will destroy us and inherit the Nine Realms. I cannot allow that.

Id: [0x002BCA8E]
They are capable of more than you know, and I will not help you bring about their ruin.

Id: [0x002BCA8F]
Then you are a fool!

Id: [0x002BCA90]
Proudly, brother. Come. Let's share the balm of all torment, the soothing liquid of chaos.

Id: [0x002BCA92]
Wait. A favor I must ask of you. Make no mention that Halfdan is ignorant of our plans. It's better this way.

Id: [0x002BCA94]
Save some mead for the rest of us, Faravid.

Id: [0x002BCA95]
Save some mead for the rest of us, Faravid.

Id: [0x002BCAB3]
I have sapped your strength, Havi. And I will take your life if your answers displease me.

Id: [0x002BCACB]
What matters is victory! Against Eadwyn and her allies.

Id: [0x002BCACC]
What matters is victory! Against Eadwyn and her allies.

Id: [0x002BCAD1]
My thanks, weaver of the obvious. Now leave me to my unholy punishment.

Id: [0x002BCADC]
I want to see the alliance map.

Id: [0x002BCADD]
I want to see the alliance map.

Id: [0x002BCAE5]
Get away with you.

Id: [0x002BCAEA]
I'm busy, leave me be.

Id: [0x002BCAEF]
Stay away from me, stranger.

Id: [0x002BCAF2]
You're not welcome here.

Id: [0x002BCAFD]
Curse you and your ilk.

Id: [0x002BCB02]
I don't know you, so why would you approach me?

Id: [0x002BCB06]
We are not friends, be gone.

Id: [0x002BCB0A]
I have no time for your twittering.

Id: [0x002BCB0E]
Dream of the pretty, straw-haired bairns (children) I'll have.

Id: [0x002BCB19]
Speak your piece, I have work to do.

Id: [0x002BCB1B]
Seen anyone here on the king's authority?

Id: [0x002BCB1C]
Seen anyone here on the king's authority?

Id: [0x002BCB25]
The only man of Aelfred's I know is Orvyn the legless.

Id: [0x002BCB27]
I don't have time for flattery. I seek Aelfred's emissary.

Id: [0x002BCB28]
I don't have time for flattery. I seek Aelfred's emissary.

Id: [0x002BCB29]
And he is…?

Id: [0x002BCB2A]
And he is…?

Id: [0x002BCB2F]
Hm. Haven't seen him in years. Probably dead drunk, or just dead in a ditch. Why do you think they called him legless?

Id: [0x002BCB33]
Here is the tree Hyrrokin mentioned, its bark cut deep by Jormungandr's sharp scales.

Id: [0x002BCB6D]
To arms! Aegir sends allies to claim back his cauldron!

Id: [0x002BCB86]
By God, I do.

Id: [0x002BCB88]
Then come to me, loyal thegn! May the blessed lands of Oxenefordscire and all of Mercia prosper!

Id: [0x002BCB90]
They come from all over to celebrate Samhain. Most are too busy with the festivities to pay us mind.

Id: [0x002BCB92]
Aye! Faces cut into lanterns to ward off evil spirits and guide children home.

Id: [0x002BCB93]
Hm. And the Mercians here are not unsettled by lurking vikingr?

Id: [0x002BCB94]

Samhain? Is that what these carved roots are for, this tradition?

Id: [0x002BCB96]
Samhain? Is that what these carved roots are for, this tradition?

Id: [0x002BCB97]
Geadric, you have shown, through stalwart combat and iron determination, both here and at the battle in Cent, that you are worthy.

Id: [0x002BCB98]
Do you swear fealty to the King of Mercia?

Id: [0x002BCB99]
I do.

Id: [0x002BCB9A]
Do you fully dedicate your life to Oxenefordscire in both peace and war?

Id: [0x002BCB9B]
I do.

Id: [0x002BCB9C]
Do you swear to work for the common good of your shire and to uphold justice for thegns and ceorls alike?

Id: [0x002BCBAC]
She and the bulk of our forces fled north-east into the swamps. I'd follow if we were fit to. We need her iron fist.

Id: [0x002BCBAE]
They have a haunted look about them. Let us bring a few back.

Id: [0x002BCBAF]

How did you do this? Where did you learn these words?

How did you do this? Where did you learn these words?

Id: [0x002BCBC9]
Harken well in hall of kings…

Id: [0x002BCBCA]
On ocean-steed, my words gain wings. Odin's mead, I forth will bring. For noble deeds, thine honor sing!

Id: [0x002BCBD3]
Don't be a coward, Eivor! Come fight me!

Id: [0x002BCBD4]
Eivor, join me when you have tired of crushing mice!

Id: [0x002BCBD7]
The strength I have!

Id: [0x002BCBD8]
The strength I have!

Id: [0x002BCBDC]
Pass the night in our camp, Eivor. Take anything you need.

Id: [0x002BCBDF]
Eadwyn! You won't get away this time.

Id: [0x002BCBE0]
Eadwyn! You won't get away this time.

Id: [0x002BCBEF]
You, there, what are you doing?

Id: [0x002BCBF2]
Yes! I am ready for whatever these green-thumbed fairy folk have to throw at us.

Id: [0x002BCBFB]
Understood! May Thor bless you all on your way!

Id: [0x002BCBFC]
We will see you soon!

Id: [0x002BCBFD]
O True One, you of the self-source. To Thee, I pray.

Id: [0x002BCBFE]
There she is … England. Our new home.

Id: [0x002BCBFF]
Not a patch on Norway, but we'll make this land our own soon enough.

Id: [0x002BCC00]
That rune is called a rood, Dag. The cross upon which their god was sacrificed. It sits atop a monastery, a place of worship.

Id: [0x002BCC01]
The hammer! Now there is a symbol worthy of a god. A bolt of lightning would take that cross clean off!

Id: [0x002BCC04]
Always! They shape precious metals and cut jewels to their gods. There will be a fortune there!

Id: [0x002BCC05]
Is there much in the way of treasure there?

Id: [0x002BCC06]

Sigurd, hold back. Something isn't right.

Sigurd, hold back. Something isn't right.

Id: [0x002BCC0C]
Good eye. There is too little movement for an army. Only tents and a few men.

Id: [0x002BCC0F]
Not the army we hoped to find?

Id: [0x002BCC10]
Not the army we hoped to find?

Marking? Gods, he's spraying like a horny pup.

Harald's colors. He is already marking his territory.

Harald's colors. He is already marking his territory.

It's with fire.

But tonight … tonight, we feast as gods!

I promised you I'd help secure your city. That task isn't yet done, it seems.

Id: [0x002BCC24]
I promised you I'd help secure your city. That task isn't yet done, it seems.

Id: [0x002BCC2F]
Ah! I have to thank you, Eivor! For your counsel, for your blade. All this would not be possible but for you.

Id: [0x002BCC30]
Pipe down you dogs. You're slaves of Cent now.

Id: [0x002BCC31]
Ah, you prefer to work in the shadows.

Id: [0x002BCC35]
I do a roaring trade at Reculver and Tunbridge. They pay well for my catch.

Id: [0x002BCC36]
The monks? Do those parchment-skinned Christians ever eat meat?

Id: [0x002BCC37]
It's rare to see Abbot Cynebert down this way.

Id: [0x002BCC38]
Abbot who?

Id: [0x002BCC39]
One more time, I'm telling you. If he says my boots are dirty or my hair needs combing. I will split him open.

Id: [0x002BCC3A]
You're full of swamp gas. You'll do what you always do, bow and scrape to our good Thegn Tedmund.

Had I died, it would have been my time. My fate is already spun.

Id: [0x002BCC5B]
You see what I deal with, Eivor? The mind of a troll in the body of an Aesir.

Id: [0x002BCC5D]
This is hardly the time for lightness, you two. We have many injured to comfort.

Id: [0x002BCC5E]
Still the same Arse-Stick as when we were children.

Id: [0x002BCC5F]
Still the same Arse-Stick as when we were children.

Come, I will introduce you. And we'll hear the full tale together.

Eivor … wait a moment.

Id: [0x002BCC6F]
The king's emissary. Sent with a letter of congratulations to the new ealdorman.

Id: [0x002BCC72]
Tonbridge Monastery sent word that the king's men always pass a few nights in their hospitality. Begin there.

Id: [0x002BCC74]
Basim has news of Sigurd. I should find him soon.

That's it! The gate is in splinters.

Id: [0x002BCC77]
Watch out, they'll be more of those archers.

Id: [0x002BCC7C]
If you say so.

Id: [0x002BCC7D]
I heard the king's men came through here, caused a stir. A man of your wit noticed them I bet?

Id: [0x002BCCAF]
'Course I do! I'm apprentice to a famous flyter, the Silent Monk. Challenge me for it!

You'll call me word-crusher, your wits I will addle.

Id: [0x002BCCB6]
The king's emissary … I need to know where he went, after he stayed here.

Id: [0x002BCCB7]
And I need to know why I've started getting boils under my armpits. Time will tell, eh?

Id: [0x002BCCB9]
Why would the godly shepherd ally with the heretic?

Id: [0x002BCCC7]
That is good news. And I would celebrate, but for the fact that Jorvik now suffers from the same infestation.

Id: [0x002BCCC8]
That is a hopeful way of seeing it. Speak to Randvi when you wish to travel there.

Id: [0x002BCCCA]
Ah, here is something for you. An odd letter arrived a few days ago. Signed by one calling himself--

Id: [0x002BCCCC]
That's right. Someone you know?

Id: [0x002BCCCD]
The letter says you must travel to Wincestre, visit God's house, and look for a man in white. Then recite this passage…

Id: [0x002BCCD0]
A Master of The Order, hewn from the trunk of their dying tree. You are getting closer to the roots.

Id: [0x002BCCD4]
Brilliant as ever, my friend. Thank you. For all you have done.

Id: [0x002BCCD6]
Your Poor Fellow-Soldier led you to the King of Wessex? How very strange. He … or she … is toying with you, it seems.

The Order has been purged from Lunden. For now, they hold no power there.

You are altogether too pious. Be open to perspectives outside those of the bishops and lords.

Cent is in disarray.

How so?

Id: [0x002BCCF7]
I'm happy to see Tedmund as ealdorman.

Id: [0x002BCCF8]
At least one of us is.

Id: [0x002BCD1C]
He is one of our targets, yes. But he is not in England.

Id: [0x002BCD1E]
Vinland is far away, according my source. It may take weeks to find him, after a long and perilous journey.

Id: [0x002BCD20]
I have something here for you. Tidings that may displease you.

Id: [0x002BCD21]
Before you go. I learned something that may displease you. Kjotve's son, Gorm, has followed in his father's footsteps.

Id: [0x002BCD22]
Interesting. Is Gorm here in England? Is he another blotch on our list?

Id: [0x002BCD23]

Let me find out for you, after I silence Gorm.

Id: [0x002BCD2C]
Then go in peace.

Id: [0x002BCD2D]
Was there something else?

Id: [0x002BCD2E]
Do you need something?

Id: [0x002BCD2F]
I have to go.

Id: [0x002BCD30]
I have to go.

If you would rather feel the edge of my blade, it can be arranged.

If you would rather feel the edge of my blade, it can be arranged.

Id: [0x002BCD41]
Now that I respect! Forceful, to the point, as refreshing as a summer ale.

Id: [0x002BCD43]
Tell me what you know, or this will go badly.

Id: [0x002BCD44]
Tell me what you know, or this will go badly.

Id: [0x002BCD46]
For you, maybe. I'll be dead, and you still won't know a thing.

Id: [0x002BCD48]
I'm wasting my time with you.

Id: [0x002BCD49]
I'm wasting my time with you.

Id: [0x002BCD4B]
Now that's just hurtful. No need to dig the blade in.

Id: [0x002BCD4C]
O, la-di-da. Listen to you all high and mighty. Get away with you, yer valley-lily.

Id: [0x002BCD4E]
Harder than it should have been.

Id: [0x002BCD4F]
Harder than it should have been.

Id: [0x002BCD50]
I did. He was getting pie-eyed with that bard Gowan and causing quite a ruckus. They left together. See? That wasn't hard was it?

Id: [0x002BCDE9]
You've been away for so long!

Id: [0x002BCDEB]
I did. And I am eager to focus on problems closer to home.

Id: [0x002BCDEC]
I did. And I'm eager to focus on problems closer to home.

Id: [0x002BCE77]
Good. I would like to hear everything about your journey to Vinland when you have time.

Id: [0x002BCE7A]
It is done. Gorm is dead. The Kjotvesson clan is wiped from this world.

Id: [0x002BCE7B]
It is done. Gorm is dead. The Kjotvesson clan is wiped from this world.

Id: [0x002BCE7C]
One day.

One day.

Id: [0x002BCFB0]
That is right. Passage to across the seas to Saint Brendan's land, is that right?

Id: [0x002BCFB1]
One and the same. It is a three week trip by longship. Arduous, dull, possibly fatal.

Id: [0x002BCFB3]
Eivor. Before you go…

Id: [0x002BCFB6]
Gorm runs this new camp. And it is a good bet all but a few will be loyal to him.

Id: [0x002BCFB8]
Only taking care of our prized drengr.

Id: [0x002BCFB9]
First things first, Eivor. My ship, my rules. Second, you follow the rules. Third, if you listen to my rules, you live.

Id: [0x002BCFBB]
Good. Let me know when you're ready and we'll get going.

Id: [0x002BCFBC]
Nessa, is it? I am Eivor. Randvi said you would be my guide.

Id: [0x002BCFBD]
Nessa, is it? I'm Eivor. Randvi said you would be my guide.

Id: [0x002BCFC0]
Should we survive, you will be compensated.

Id: [0x002BCFC1]
Should we survive, you will be compensated.

Id: [0x002BCFC4]
Good thinking.

Id: [0x002BCFC5]
Good thinking.

Id: [0x002BCFC6]
Understood.

Id: [0x002BCFC7]
Understood.

Id: [0x002BCFC9]
See and hear me. Illuminate the darkness in my soul.

Id: [0x002BCFCE]
Ready to set sail?

Id: [0x002BCFCF]
Say the words and we are off.

Id: [0x002BCFD2]
Hop in, we'll leave now.

Id: [0x002BCFD4]
Very good. We can leave now.

Id: [0x002BCFD6]
And I will be here.

Id: [0x002BCFD7]
I'll leave my gear behind and dress the part. To Vinland we go.

Id: [0x002BCFD8]
I will leave my gear behind and dress the part. To Vinland we go.

Id: [0x002BCFD9]
We should return to England.

Id: [0x002BCFDA]
We should return to England.

Id: [0x002BCFDB]
I will be back.

Id: [0x002BCFDC]
I will be back.

Id: [0x002BCFE2]
Gods, Eivor. I was robbed! On the road between here and Lincoln.

Id: [0x002BCFE3]
Tekla, you look like you wrestled a bear. Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002BCFE4]
Tekla, you look like you wrestled a bear. Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002BCFE9]
Yes, it is returning to me now. This ancient shrine is set alight by this sphere of metal.

Id: [0x002BCFEB]
And these shining arms, these branches. They will grant us access to the refuge of the gods.

Id: [0x002BCFEC]
To Valhalla. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002BCFF7]
You speak for yourself, Eivor. For I am no mortal. I see that now. I know it.

Id: [0x002BCFF8]
Sigurd, take great care. We should not tinker with the tools of the gods.

Id: [0x002BCFF9]
Sigurd, take great care. We should not tinker with the tools of the gods.

Id: [0x002BCFFD]
What lies beyond all this? Where does this lead?

Id: [0x002BCFFE]
What lies beyond all this? Where does this lead?

Id: [0x002BCFFF]
Take your place at the center there, and you will see.

Id: [0x002BD008]
You should not have fucked with me, Cynon.

Id: [0x002BD009]
You should not have fucked with me, Cynon.

Id: [0x002BD00F]
Right. And I love that about her. I love … everything about her.

Id: [0x002BD022]
I want you at the helm of ours. You're strong and agile.

Id: [0x002BD026]
I've seen them in action.

Id: [0x002BD027]
I've seen them in action.

Id: [0x002BD02B]
Let's get through these walls first, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002BD02C]
Let's get through these walls first, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002BD02D]
Forgive me, Lord. I have bore false witness, conspired to commit the most deadly of sins.

Id: [0x002BD031]
Christians don't curse.

Id: [0x002BD034]
Let's cut his throat now and water the orchards with his blood.

Id: [0x002BD035]
Let's cut his throat now and water the orchards with his blood.

Id: [0x002BD03D]
Yield! Yield! Yield!

Id: [0x002BD041]
Still warm with blood when he handed it to me. I had fourteen winters.

Id: [0x002BD045]
Speak without guise, Eivor. Does he plot against me or no? Does he keep secrets? Give me something I can use.

Id: [0x002BD053]
This'll be fun. You can't take us all on!

Id: [0x002BD05B]
Old friend. Long ago, we stormed this sea-of-wagons under winter's blanket … you've stood at my side for many long years.

Id: [0x002BD06A]
We got what we came for.

Id: [0x002BD06C]
Hemming Jarl has confided in you? About his health?

Id: [0x002BD06E]
Vili lives in another world entirely, right now. He is cracked inside, and will not face the full truth laid before him.

Id: [0x002BD070]
He has. He said Vili wasn't taking it well.

Id: [0x002BD071]
He has. He said Vili wasn't taking it well.

Id: [0x002BD074]
And how are you? Have you braced yourself for what is to come?

Id: [0x002BD075]
And how are you? Have you braced yourself for what is to come?

Id: [0x002BD077]
I … I have made my peace with the future, yes.

Id: [0x002BD07F]
There's the chief. Now to strike him down.

Id: [0x002BD080]
There's the chief. Now to strike him down.

Id: [0x002BD089]
He was pissed as a newt. Last I saw, he was passed out in trees between the harbor and bridge. Now go find someone else to vex.

Id: [0x002BD090]
Help me! This Dane has murder in mind!

Id: [0x002BD0A9]
Argh!

Id: [0x002BD0AE]
Not at all. The more scars, the better the boast. Look at my father, a battle-worn veteran, carved up like a goat on a spit.

Id: [0x002BD0B1]
These skirmishes with the Picts, they've worn you down.

Id: [0x002BD0B2]
These skirmishes with the Picts, they've worn you down.

Id: [0x002BD0EE]
It is not my house. It is the clan's house, and the clan will decide what happens next.

Id: [0x002BD0F0]
When he departs for the corpse hall, you will take his place. As expected.

Id: [0x002BD0F1]
When he departs for the corpse hall, you will take his place. As expected.

Id: [0x002BD104]
How might I gain his influence if he will not speak to me? Or to anyone! 'Tis a puzzle.

Id: [0x002BD10B]
A fortress stormed, a man kidnapped. If you beat back his enemy, saved him from sure death, his gratitude would…

Id: [0x002BD10C]
A fortress stormed, a man kidnapped. If you beat back his enemy, saved him from sure death, his gratitude would…

Id: [0x002BD10E]
There is a lumber mill nearby, correct?

Id: [0x002BD10F]
Beamasfield. Aelfred invests much in fortifying Wessex, and uses our forests to do so. The mill provides his wood.

Id: [0x002BD11E]
Agreed. If we do this, you'll earn the right to call me friend ten-thousand fold.

Id: [0x002BD11F]
Agreed. If we do this, you'll earn the right to call me friend ten-thousand fold.

Id: [0x002BD127]
This emissary, how will I find him?

Id: [0x002BD128]
This emissary, how will I find him?

Id: [0x002BD134]
Perhaps, perhaps not.

Id: [0x002BD139]
Are you hiding something, Basim?

Id: [0x002BD13A]
Are you hiding something, Basim?

Id: [0x002BD13C]
I don't believe it's necessary…

Id: [0x002BD13D]
We can take him from Rouecistre Fortress. We'll need a small, experienced force of men.

Id: [0x002BD13E]
We can take him from Rouecistre Fortress. We'll need a small, experienced force of men.

Id: [0x002BD13F]
Rouecistre is not a house of straw and sticks! It is a garrison, crawling with soldiers. I don't see how it's possible.

Id: [0x002BD141]
There's another way. Much easier…

Id: [0x002BD142]
Has he any family we could hold for ransom? You could swoop in, rescue them, play the hero.

Id: [0x002BD143]
Has he any family we could hold for ransom? You could swoop in, rescue them, play the hero.

Id: [0x002BD160]
Yet with every snap of the flail, with every scar, with the loss of my arm … my visions grew stronger.

Id: [0x002BD167]
What she did to you was cruel beyond measure.

Id: [0x002BD168]
What she did to you was cruel beyond measure.

Id: [0x002BD16D]
I am with you, Brother. Until the end.

Id: [0x002BD16E]
I am with you, Brother. Until the end.

Id: [0x002BD182]
It must be near. I know the shape of these rocks! Yes, we are close.

Id: [0x002BD184]
We would be poor company with frozen bones and ice pellets for eyes.

Id: [0x002BD185]
We would be poor company with frozen bones and ice pellets for eyes.

Id: [0x002BD186]
For the sake of frozen fingers, I hope so.

Id: [0x002BD187]
For the sake of frozen fingers, I hope so.

Id: [0x002BD188]
Tedmund is there.

Id: [0x002BD18A]
Impossible! How do you know?

Id: [0x002BD18B]
I heard rumors that Tedmund had been lured out of self-exile. To manage work on the fortifications of Canterbury.

Id: [0x002BD18D]
It may still work. Yes, yes, bring him to the Megaliths.

Id: [0x002BD18E]
Taking him from a lumberyard is less dangerous than assaulting a fortress.

Id: [0x002BD18F]
Taking him from a lumberyard is less dangerous than assaulting a fortress.

Id: [0x002BD1A2]
Why would anyone want to end their life here?

Id: [0x002BD1A3]
Unless they felt it was just beginning.

Id: [0x002BD1A4]
You cannot thwart the gods! You cannot change destiny!

Id: [0x002BD1A7]
Fling yourself from the mountaintop! Cling not to a place that isn't yours!

Id: [0x002BD1A8]
Fuck your prophecy, your lies!

Id: [0x002BD1AA]
My vision has come to pass! I stand at the mountain's peak!

Id: [0x002BD1AD]
As it was fortold … as it was seen!

Id: [0x002BD1AE]
You were mad and naked on the moors and I folded you into my family! I trusted you!

Id: [0x002BD1B0]
Destiny? If you kick a hornet's nest, it's not "destiny" when you get stung!

Id: [0x002BD1B1]
Destiny? If you kick a hornet's nest, it's not "destiny" when you get stung!

Id: [0x002BD1B4]
You stand on the bodies of your brethren!

Id: [0x002BD1B5]
You stand on the bodies of your brethren!

Id: [0x002BD1C1]
I climbed to the peak of the mountain … to my … my destiny.

Id: [0x002BD1DF]
Well, it's good to see you breathing still.

Id: [0x002BD1E0]
Well, it's good to see you breathing still.

Id: [0x002BD1E2]
I like you, Eivor. You may help me here or step on me, and by the look of you, I'd welcome either.

Id: [0x002BD1E4]
It is good to have you in this fight, Birna.

Id: [0x002BD1E5]
It's good to have you in this fight, Birna.

Id: [0x002BD1E6]
A longship is heavy with fate. Just a few lengths of wood between you and a watery grave.

Id: [0x002BD1E7]
Likewise, Eivor. Thanks again for plucking me and my warriors from the mire.

Id: [0x002BD20E]
Shit.[beat] Prophecy is a strange web, is it not? Tewdwr's reformation just needed a kidnapping and a dedicated Dane.

Id: [0x002BD210]
Eivor. Modron will have taken Tewdwr to her forest temple. If you make haste, you might be able to stay her blade.

Id: [0x002BD22A]
Either way, we claim victory.

Id: [0x002BD22D]
Eivor, yes. Down in Mercia. Kingmaker with my brothers Ivarr and Ubba. And Finnr in East Anglia.

Id: [0x002BD237]
Tonna's longhouse. I should have a look around.

Id: [0x002BD238]
Tonna's longhouse. I should have a look around.

Id: [0x002BD23D]
The abbot is a friend of Fulke's, that is clear.

Id: [0x002BD23F]
Indeed. This brings to mind a story, perhaps you've heard of it? The scorpion and the frog.

Id: [0x002BD241]
A cautionary tale. The scorpion wants to cross the river, but he cannot swim. So he enlists the help of the frog.

Id: [0x002BD242]
The frog agrees to carry him on his back, extracting a promise that the scorpion will not sting him.

Id: [0x002BD244]
The scorpion crosses the river and stings an innocent man, killing him. So, what does this tale tell us?

Id: [0x002BD246]
It shows that every tale has a thousand possible outcomes, many of which are surprising.

Id: [0x002BD248]
The practice of learning has waned considerably in England since the days of the Romans.

Id: [0x002BD249]
What books they still have, they keep locked away in their churches, hidden from the eyes of common folk.

Id: [0x002BD24A]
Aristotle, Pythagoras, Euclid … ancient knowledge lost to all but a few hard-headed men of the cloth.

Id: [0x002BD24C]
In my youth, I was consumed with a passion for understanding. I spent many hours a day in the House of Wisdom in Baghdad.

Id: [0x002BD24E]
A great library, full of the greatest learning of mankind. For a boy seeking answers, it holds many riches.

Id: [0x002BD24F]
One day, I was sitting cross-legged, devouring a study by the great astronomer al-Khwarizmi.

Id: [0x002BD250]
With a swiftness belying his years, the papers were plucked from my grasp by the great man himself.

Id: [0x002BD251]
His presence stole my voice. He was kind and openhearted. He showed me such scientific wonders.

Id: [0x002BD253]
Calendars and calculations placing the sun, moon, and five planets.

Id: [0x002BD254]
Equations that crackled and sparkled with divine intelligence. I asked the great man, "Is this what it is to know God?"

Id: [0x002BD256]
I found wisdom. And I have been searching for more ever since. There is great vastness outside ourselves, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BD257]
Most only notice a few grains of the sand. But some, like Sigurd, I believe, see the endless flow of the hourglass.

Id: [0x002BD25B]
You have studied these works yourself?

Id: [0x002BD25C]
You have studied these works yourself?

Id: [0x002BD25D]
A seminary?

Id: [0x002BD25E]
A seminary?

Id: [0x002BD25F]
And what did you learn there?

Id: [0x002BD260]
And what did you learn there?

Id: [0x002BD261]
You saw your God's hand in the runes?

Id: [0x002BD262]
You saw your God's hand in the runes?

Id: [0x002BD266]
And so we have. To steal a man, take him with swiftness, and escape without anyone on our heels.

Id: [0x002BD268]
Yet as a leader yourself, you cannot deny that subtlety and intrigue are a cloak you must wear.

Id: [0x002BD26A]
I prefer to act and speak plain. Kings and lords who do not are often misunderstood.

Id: [0x002BD26B]
I prefer to act and speak plain. Kings and lords who do not are often misunderstood.

Id: [0x002BD26E]
What you see in Sigurd … is this what Fulke sees as well?

Id: [0x002BD26F]
What you see in Sigurd … is this what Fulke sees as well?

Id: [0x002BD28D]
Brother Shergar? You are far from Augustine's priory!

Id: [0x002BD28E]
Keep those gates locked. If they come within a foot of here, kill them.

Id: [0x002BD292]
At once, my jarl.

Id: [0x002BD295]
Then to Donecaestre for a for victory feast!

Id: [0x002BD29A]
Quite a haul of goods they've hidden away.

Id: [0x002BD29B]
Quite a haul of goods they've hidden away.

Id: [0x002BD2A0]
I left the cloisters many moons ago, Your Holiness. The monastic life was not my calling.

Id: [0x002BD2A4]
Rouecistre is our only path forward, whether by stealth or force.

Id: [0x002BD2A5]
Rouecistre is our only path forward, whether by stealth or force.

Id: [0x002BD2AD]
The Nornir knit winding paths that cannot be unknotted. It seems Rouecistre was always in our path.

The Nornir knit winding paths that cannot be unknotted. It seems Rouecistre was always in our path.

Id: [0x002BD2B0]
Any false moves and I will snip your heels.

Id: [0x002BD2B5]
Are you sure that's Tedmund? He's dressed as a lord, but that man is shorter and fatter than I recall.

Id: [0x002BD2B6]
I'm not Tedmund! I'm not! I swear upon the holy rood, I am not Thegn Tedmund!

Id: [0x002BD2B8]
What in Heaven's name is happening here?

Id: [0x002BD2BB]
The captain does not know Tedmund well. If we keep our heads, he will not question my orders. I hope.

Id: [0x002BD2BC]
This ham hock will get us all killed.

Id: [0x002BD2C9]
We'll send a message to Oxenefordscire. The men of Mercia would gladly take a swipe at Wessex.

Id: [0x002BD2CA]
We'll send a message to Oxenefordscire. The men of Mercia would gladly take a swipe at Wessex.

Id: [0x002BD2D1]
Is that why you've come here? To earn Halfdan's trust? To find a seat at his table?

Id: [0x002BD2D4]
Don't you believe in Jesus? They refrain because he died for our sins.

Id: [0x002BD2D5]
No one will stop me sucking the marrow from a nice leg of lamb. Not even God's seed.

Id: [0x002BD2D7]
You know, the rich one, the monastery that brews ale. He keeps half the menfolk in the county from their wives.

Id: [0x002BD2D8]
Ending up with an ale-soused wastrel is another reason I've not taken a husband.

Id: [0x002BD2D9]
If you're waiting for a sober one, you'll die an old maid.

Id: [0x002BD2DB]
I'm not even sure it's him we're working for.

Id: [0x002BD2DC]
Don't be daft. Who else would it be? A changeling spirited there by fairy-folk? Get back to patrol.

Id: [0x002BD2E5]
From the tales I hear, I feared you might be taller.

Id: [0x002BD2F8]
Who is this? Come closer.

Id: [0x002BD2FA]
Thank you for your tribute, Eivor Wolf-Kissed. Your battles and deeds are well known to me.

Id: [0x002BD2FE]
To men and women who needed it most.

Id: [0x002BD2FF]
To men and women who needed it most.

Id: [0x002BD302]
Why? What have you heard?

Id: [0x002BD303]
His double was abducted from the lumber mill at Beamasfield.

Id: [0x002BD304]
Tedmund had a double? That is news to me.

Id: [0x002BD305]
That's what I'm saying. Either this is a message, or someone tried to kidnap him and instead got the feigned thegn.

Id: [0x002BD30C]
I don't regret sending Faravid to lead our strike against the Picts … in spite of Eivor winning the day.

Id: [0x002BD30D]
I try never to regret the decisions I make in a time of war.

Id: [0x002BD30E]
I try never to regret the decisions I make in a time of war.

Id: [0x002BD316]
I'll help you.

Id: [0x002BD317]
I'll help you.

Id: [0x002BD31B]
I'm ready to fight. Let's put them in the ground.

Id: [0x002BD31C]
I'm ready to fight. Let's put them in the ground.

Id: [0x002BD321]
Fair enough. Halfdan gets what he is owed.

Id: [0x002BD322]
Fair enough. Halfdan gets what he is owed.

Id: [0x002BD327]
You will die for the indignities you have showered upon me, Dane!

Id: [0x002BD32B]
It was good to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you against the pox-dogs of Wessex. May our friendship endure.

Id: [0x002BD32D]
When you find him again, come see me. We'll feast and sing, with mead and friendship to warm us.

Id: [0x002BD32F]
You fought like beasts escaped from your hell today, Geadric. Your oath to me is fulfilled.

Id: [0x002BD330]

This tangle-briar of Christians and lords means nothing to me. I'm here for Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BD332]
This tangle-briar of Christians and lords means nothing to me. I'm here for Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BD338]
I followed the abbot here, kept him in my sight. But the monks, his servants, I have seen nothing of them.

Id: [0x002BD33A]
In his quarters. Come, and be on your guard.

Id: [0x002BD33B]
I would say, well met, brother, but I cannot shake off the needle-itch of dread. Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002BD33C]
I would say, well met, brother, but I cannot shake off the needle-itch of dread. Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002BD33D]
And where is the abbot now?

Id: [0x002BD33E]
And where is the abbot now?

Id: [0x002BD341]
There is truth in that. Keep your eyes and blade sharp.

Does this have the stench of betrayal to you, brother?

Cynebert is a man who craves power and position. With Tedmund dead, he must find it somewhere else.

Where is my brother?

Id: [0x002BD34E]

And yet it rounds on us at every turn, snarling like a cornered dog. I begin to despair of ever settling here.

And yet it rounds on us at every turn, snarling like a cornered dog. I begin to despair of ever settling here.

Id: [0x002BD359]
I have long been away. But it is fiercely beautiful beneath the vanity, arrogance, and pettiness of men.

Id: [0x002BD360]
Good. Now we dig in, and wait for our friends.

Id: [0x002BD395]
Ah! Watch yourself, heathen! You handle me too roughly!

Id: [0x002BD398]
You there! Heathens! Let this good man go, or suffer an iron sickness!

Id: [0x002BD399]
And what do you offer us in return?

Id: [0x002BD39B]
Give them what they ask, Cynebert!

Id: [0x002BD39C]
A hefty sum, that will leave God's coffers hollow. I cannot give it up without some assurance … Tedmund?

Id: [0x002BD39D]
You extort me in return for my life?

Id: [0x002BD39F]
You were swiftly met, abbot. Not long after these … these scallious worms took my fort.

Id: [0x002BD3A0]
On the Lord's bidding, Tedmund! At prayer, a terrible vision befell me. A host of heathens, your life in danger…

Id: [0x002BD3A1]
A coincidence I find rather … [cough]rather ominous, abbot. Do you--[cough]

Id: [0x002BD3A2]
God help you man, are you well?

Id: [0x002BD3A6]
The work of a poison, no doubt.

Id: [0x002BD3A7]
No no no no, rouse the man! He cannot be dead! He must not be dead!

Id: [0x002BD3AB]
A catastrophe! Aelfred will chose another and … by the saints, Aelfred! How will I explain this to the king?

Id: [0x002BD3AC]
We lost many good men storming this keep. It will not be in vain, Christ-slave. Twenty chests of silver.

Id: [0x002BD3AD]
We lost many good men storming this keep. It will not be in vain, Christ-slave. Twenty chests of silver.

Id: [0x002BD3AE]
Poison? How does the man die of poison in our arms!

Id: [0x002BD3AF]
Poison? How does the man die of poison in our arms!

Id: [0x002BD3B1]
You shall have your paladin. I … I need a day. Return to my abbey tomorrow and you shall … O, dear. O, dear.

Id: [0x002BD3B4]
Peace, Eivor. Speak with Geadric and relieve him of his oath. I'll meet you at Cynebert's abbey.

Id: [0x002BD3B5]
We followed this road to its end, Cynebert. You may not like where it led, but you owe us our half of the bargain.

Id: [0x002BD3B6]
We followed this road to its end, Cynebert. You may not like where it led, but you owe us our half of the bargain.

Id: [0x002BD3B9]
I do not think so. But there is no good here in this grave-hush.

Id: [0x002BD3BA]
Dead?

Id: [0x002BD3BB]
Dead?

Id: [0x002BD3BD]
The reek from this root turns my stomach.

Id: [0x002BD3BE]
The reek from this root turns my stomach.

Id: [0x002BD3C0]
The boars are closing in. Drawn by the smell of the root?

Id: [0x002BD3C1]
The boars are closing in. Drawn by the smell of the root?

Id: [0x002BD3C3]
The dear abbot sent me a warm invitation. Said my friends were eager to meet with me.

Id: [0x002BD3C4]
Meet us at the shore near Rouecistre Harbor once that naval chain is down.

Id: [0x002BD3CB]
Are you ready, Eivor? Your allies stand firm. We await your final order.

Id: [0x002BD3D1]
For many moons, I could not sleep, always thinking of his betrayal. The horrors I wished upon him.

Id: [0x002BD3DA]
Put it out of your mind, Sigurd. There is no need to hound the old man.

Id: [0x002BD3DB]
Put it out of your mind, Sigurd. There is no need to hound the old man.

Id: [0x002BD3DE]
I will say what needs to be said.

Id: [0x002BD3E0]
O no, I crave it.

Id: [0x002BD3E1]
Do you fear his rebuke?

Id: [0x002BD3E2]
Do you fear his rebuke?

Id: [0x002BD3E5]
Let us take Rouecistre.

Id: [0x002BD3E6]
Let us take Rouecistre.

Id: [0x002BD3EA]
I still need more time.

Id: [0x002BD3EB]
I still need more time.

Id: [0x002BD3EE]
I mean you no harm.

Id: [0x002BD3EF]
I mean you no harm.

Id: [0x002BD3F2]
Do not fear me, Saxon.

Id: [0x002BD3F3]
Do not fear me, Saxon.

Id: [0x002BD3F4]
What I won't drink is one of Moira's herbal brews. She claims they're a tonic. But there's not telling what she hides in those drinks.

Id: [0x002BD3FA]
Ubba has his way and you have yours, that much is clear. I'm not here to play favorites.

Id: [0x002BD3FB]
Ubba has his way and you have yours, that much is clear. I'm not here to play favorites.

Id: [0x002BD401]
No, you are here to make your mark. I know what it means to be a young drengr (courageous warrior). You think of glory and destiny.

Id: [0x002BD403]
You've got me all figured out.

Id: [0x002BD404]
You've got me all figured out.

Id: [0x002BD40E]
Well, I hope eternal damnation is worth it.

Id: [0x002BD410]
Your lives!

Id: [0x002BD411]
Kill her, and we'll never find Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BD412]
Sit, Eivor. Eat. And let me tell you the tale of a man who talks with gods.

Id: [0x002BD414]
Sigurd is something else. Sigurd has been touched. He is deified. The gods, they speak through him.

Id: [0x002BD416]
You should have listened, Eivor. I tried to tell you. The gods are real. And their power is within our grasp.

Id: [0x002BD419]
You mock me. I have killed for much less.

Id: [0x002BD41A]
You mock me. I have killed for much less.

Id: [0x002BD41B]
You lured him in with that lie. Your words are bile and blight.

Id: [0x002BD41C]
You lured him in with that lie. Your words are bile and blight.

Id: [0x002BD480]
You could if you wish. My father was an architect, a builder of wonders. The Great Mosque of Samarra, his masterpiece.

Id: [0x002BD481]
Do you miss the land of your birth?

Id: [0x002BD482]
Do you miss the land of your birth?

Id: [0x002BD483]
I should like to see it.

Id: [0x002BD484]
I should like to see it.

Id: [0x002BD4FC]
Whatever we find there, keep your head.

Id: [0x002BD504]
One lie piles upon another. How many may stack before they tumble to ground, and the painful truth comes clear?

Id: [0x002BD505]

Id: [0x002BD51F]
There's the ealdorman. Cynon!

Id: [0x002BD523]
A good leader, seeing to his people's needs. Let us join hands when his task is done.

Id: [0x002BD524]
A good leader, seeing to his people's needs. Let us join hands when his task is done.

Id: [0x002BD52E]
To Sigurd!

Id: [0x002BD54A]
Lead on, then. I shall follow.

Id: [0x002BD54F]
Eivor, search the perches and lookouts here. He could be spying from above.

Id: [0x002BD551]
Hands as clammy as a dead haddock, but his heart is in the right place. And he'll be ealdorman after Cynon.

Id: [0x002BD564]
Varin? Father?

Id: [0x002BD565]
Varin? Father?

Id: [0x002BD568]
Blast! Where is he?

Id: [0x002BD569]
Blast! Where is he?

Id: [0x002BD573]
How dare you deny me!

Id: [0x002BD575]
Everything you believe in stirs before you! Yet you question all! You question the very gods!

Id: [0x002BD577]
Stand aside! My people need me!

Id: [0x002BD578]
Stand aside! My people need me!

Id: [0x002BD57A]
You have killed kings and crowned them as you desired, bowing to none.

Id: [0x002BD57C]
You have earned your place here, Eivor. Seize it!

Id: [0x002BD57E]
Men who do not take kindly to Dane invaders creeping into our camp.

Id: [0x002BD5A0]
You spoke with Moira. What did you learn?

Id: [0x002BD5A1]
(grunts)

Id: [0x002BD5A3]
No … No no no. This is not an illness. This is poison. Somehow, someone is poisoning me!

Id: [0x002BD5A4]
She also said she's seen your illness before. In her own family. Said it came on slow but was … incurable.

Id: [0x002BD5A5]
She also said she's seen your illness before. In her own family. Said it came on slow but was … incurable.

Id: [0x002BD5A6]
I'll peck out your eyes and feed them to your god.

Id: [0x002BD5A8]
(unintelligible)[Christ, not again.]

Id: [0x002BD5A9]
You are either fearless or stupid, boy, to speak to someone of the Raven Clan this way.

Id: [0x002BD5AB]
Gunnar, we are guests here. Let him go, we can hooden more.

Id: [0x002BD5AC]
Gunnar, we are guests here. Let him go, we can hooden more.

Id: [0x002BD5C8]
Be nice to sleep in a real bed when this is over.

Id: [0x002BD5CA]
[deep breath]I should do this more often. Relaxing.

Id: [0x002BD5CB]
Probably bought this in a coffee shop, somewhere in Concord.

Id: [0x002BD5CC]
Runes?

Id: [0x002BD5CD]
Oof… I'd rather walk into town than use this.

Id: [0x002BD5CE]
Eivor carved these runes.

Id: [0x002BD5CF]
Would love to play a round, but I have bigger things on my mind.

Id: [0x002BD5D0]
Why did Leofrith ride out in a hurry like that … what's going on?

Id: [0x002BD5D1]
His Lordship wouldn't say. Strictest confidence.

Id: [0x002BD5D2]
Was it the king's orders? And the rest of us are just supposed to stay here? Like sitting ducks?

Id: [0x002BD5D3]
If you don't cut your wailing, that's exactly what we'll be. So keep your voice down.

Id: [0x002BD5D4]
But I don't like this, not one bit.

Id: [0x002BD5D5]
Your turn. She won't talk to me.

Id: [0x002BD5D6]
What's going on out there!

Id: [0x002BD5D7]
They're here for the king!

Id: [0x002BD5D8]
Keep them away from the crypt!

Id: [0x002BD5DA]
I'm all right. Really. A few nicks and cuts from the battle, that's all.

Id: [0x002BD5DD]
I threw myself at him, Eivor. But he only toyed with me. He knew I couldn't touch him.

Id: [0x002BD5DF]
It was. It was our fight. Yours, mine, my father's. I had to help.

Id: [0x002BD5E1]
Back there, with Leofrith … why did you see it fit to kill him?

Id: [0x002BD5E3]
I … I think I understand.

Id: [0x002BD5E4]
Back there, with Leofrith … I didn't think you'd spare him.

Id: [0x002BD5E6]
He knows the truth now.

Id: [0x002BD5E7]
Careful, you're injured.

Id: [0x002BD5E8]
Careful, you're injured.

Id: [0x002BD5EB]
These wounds will heal quickly. You're lucky.

Id: [0x002BD5EC]
These wounds will heal quickly. You're lucky.

Id: [0x002BD5ED]
You should have stayed hidden, Ceolbert. This wasn't your fight.

Id: [0x002BD5EE]
You should have stayed hidden, Ceolbert. This wasn't your fight.

Id: [0x002BD5EF]
And you did. You showed courage today. Bravery. You're a boy no longer.

Id: [0x002BD5F0]
And you did. You showed courage today. Bravery. You are a boy no longer.

Id: [0x002BD5F1]
Leofrith was a fighter who knew the cost of war. He died defending an idea he believed in, true or not. There is some honor in that.

Id: [0x002BD5F2]
Leofrith was a fighter who knew the cost of war. He died defending an idea he believed in, true or not. There's some honor in that.

Id: [0x002BD5F3]
There is no honor in killing a man misled. He believed his king would die fighting for Mercia.

Id: [0x002BD5F4]
There is no honor in killing a man misled. He believed his king would die fighting for Mercia.

Id: [0x002BD604]
Very true, very true. Join me if you desire!

Id: [0x002BD60C]
I beg of you now … do not let my lessons die. Pass them on.

Id: [0x002BD7C2]
The pyre's construction is underway, and all of our guests are lodged and welcomed. We could begin shortly.

Id: [0x002BD803]
Too much drink in too little time. The cure for that is sleep.

Id: [0x002BD804]
Forgive me. I … I thought you were someone else.

Id: [0x002BD805]
Forgive me. I … I thought you were someone else.

Id: [0x002BD80C]
You gonna put this in the fridge, Shaun?

Id: [0x002BD80D]
Of course. In half a minute.

Id: [0x002BD80E]
Remember, tomatoes go on the counter. Not the fridge.

Id: [0x002BD80F]
Ah, the wonderful smell of wood smoke. I'm glad some things never change.

Id: [0x002BD810]
Non-empathic art? That's rather dull.

Id: [0x002BD812]
A message for me? Hm. Not likely.

Id: [0x002BD813]
Hello, little fella.

Id: [0x002BD824]
But we've gained so much in England. And we stand to win even more.

Id: [0x002BD825]
But we've gained so much in England. And we stand to win even more.

Id: [0x002BD826]
If you can find the good in that, fine. But she was as mad as the ocean is wide.

Id: [0x002BD827]
If you can find the good in that, fine. But she was as mad as the ocean is wide.

Id: [0x002BD835]
No! We must confront the omens and honor the gods. They will not seek or find you. We must go to them.

Id: [0x002BD83A]
Could we not wait until this tempest quiets down? With the ship, where we have mead and food to warm us?

Id: [0x002BD83B]
Could we not wait until this tempest quiets down? With this ship, where we have mead and food to warm us?

Id: [0x002BD83E]
The day is done!

To perish on a lonely fjord, we'd be the shame of our clan.

Id: [0x002BD842]
To perish on a lonely fjord, we'd be the shame of our clan.

Id: [0x002BD847]
Trust this place, Eivor. This old and sacred place.

Id: [0x002BD84C]
Sigurd, I … I don't know what to say. This is all so strange.

Id: [0x002BD84D]
Sigurd, I … I don't know what to say. This is all so strange.

Id: [0x002BD84E]
There! Do you feel that? The sacred energies?

Id: [0x002BD850]
All this and more.

Id: [0x002BD851]
I have never seen something so grand.

Id: [0x002BD852]
I have never seen something so grand.

Id: [0x002BD853]
I got the data. Sending it now.

Id: [0x002BD873]
Follow me! Into this kingdom of snow!

Id: [0x002BD886]
Will you not say where this leads?

Id: [0x002BD887]
Will you not say where this leads?

Id: [0x002BD890]
Stay away from me!

Id: [0x002BD891]
My husband will send you all to Hell!

Id: [0x002BD892]
Help! Help me!

Id: [0x002BD8B2]
A clash of iron. There is fighting nearby.

Id: [0x002BD8B3]
A clash of iron. There's fighting nearby.

Id: [0x002BD8B8]
I saw you, Father.

Id: [0x002BD8B9]
I saw you, Father.

Id: [0x002BD8BB]
Varin. My father.

Id: [0x002BD8BC]
Varin. My father.

Id: [0x002BD8BD]
That Dane merchant, Tonna. She must know something about where Burgred's hiding.

Id: [0x002BD8BE]
Ubba and Ivarr gathered their men and set off in different directions. You should follow up with them.

Id: [0x002BD8BF]
Aethelswith might not know it yet, but she's saved many lives giving up her king. Let's finish this now.

Id: [0x002BD8C7]
I saw a small pond nearby. Will you come?

Id: [0x002BD8CD]
Come on, Wolf-Kissed! Let me cut you a new scar!

Id: [0x002BD8CF]
You will beg for Fulke when I have done with you.

Id: [0x002BD8D0]
You will beg for Fulke when I have done with you.

Id: [0x002BD8DB]
We besieged Jorvik and put King Aella in the cold ground. Those were good days, now too far gone.

Id: [0x002BD8DD]
Quiet, Yanli! Please!

Id: [0x002BD8E4]
Sigurd! Dag! In here! Those men had prisoners.

Id: [0x002BD8E5]
Sigurd! Dag! In here! Those men had prisoners.

Id: [0x002BD8E7]
I asked you that!

Id: [0x002BD8E9]
Stay out of sight.

Id: [0x002BD8EA]
Stay out of sight.

Id: [0x002BD8EF]
We are very agreeable people, I promise! You need not kill us.

Id: [0x002BD8F1]
Yanli. I'm a merchant, not a bandit like those others. And this is Rowan.

Id: [0x002BD8F5]
They meant to sell us next, as slaves to the nearest bidder. But I'd rip their eyes out before I let that happen.

Id: [0x002BD8F6]
And how did you find yourselves here?

Id: [0x002BD8F8]
We came to trade with the Sons of Ragnar, at Halfdan Jarl's asking. But they were gone when we arrived.

Id: [0x002BD90F]
I have given my aid as well. The battle must be decisive.

Id: [0x002BD910]
I have given my aid as well. The battle must be decisive.

Id: [0x002BD936]
How dare you speak of those days! As if they meant anything to a traitor like you!

Id: [0x002BD938]
And as you suspected, the Sons of Ragnar moved there some months ago. We know for sure that Ivarr and Ubba are alive and well in Repton.

Id: [0x002BD939]
Excellent work, both of you. Now have a rest and a horn of ale. You have more than earned it.

Id: [0x002BD93A]
Thank you, Randvi. We'll be here if you need us.

Id: [0x002BD93C]
Lord…

Id: [0x002BD93D]
Lord…

Id: [0x002BD942]
Gods! Am I to be hounded by a parade of blood-minded traitors the whole of my life? There is no end to this.

Id: [0x002BD943]
I … I need some time to breathe. Let me sit a moment.

Id: [0x002BD947]
Cur!

Id: [0x002BD948]
Cur!

Id: [0x002BD949]
Honor-drunk fool!

Id: [0x002BD94A]
Honor-drunk fool!

Id: [0x002BD94B]
(howl)

Id: [0x002BD951]
This place is a lie!

Id: [0x002BD952]
This place is a lie!

Id: [0x002BD954]
You would resign yourself to an empty death?

Id: [0x002BD955]
I do not want it. Not like this.

Id: [0x002BD956]
I do not want it. Not like this.

Id: [0x002BD959]
And with that truth, he forged a new path.

Id: [0x002BD95A]
And with that truth, he forges a new path.

Id: [0x002BD95D]
All the people, new and old.

Id: [0x002BD95E]
All the people, new and old.

Id: [0x002BD968]
Rowan.

Id: [0x002BD969]
Rowan.

Id: [0x002BD96E]
Sigurd means to leave as well.

Id: [0x002BD971]
Basim's motives are his own, leave it at that. We have more pressing plans.

Id: [0x002BD972]
I am riding to Ledecestrescire, to a town called Repton. Eivor, I expect you to join me when you have finished here.

Id: [0x002BD973]
What was that about? Is Basim leaving us already?

Id: [0x002BD974]
What was that about? Is Basim leaving us already?

Id: [0x002BD980]
I have given you everything you wanted. Everything you needed!

Id: [0x002BD982]
You gave me nothing. It was all me!

Id: [0x002BD983]
You gave me nothing. It was all me!

Id: [0x002BD986]
O, and here … this corpse will not have need of it.

Id: [0x002BD988]
Go. I'll meet you by the ship.

Id: [0x002BD989]
Go. I will meet you by the ship.

Id: [0x002BD9BC]
You bruised his pride, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BD9BD]
His pride makes him difficult. And his anger makes him hasty. But he is not without honest feeling.

Id: [0x002BD9CD]
What was it Randvi said? Our father spends his days in the meadhalls and his nights on barren planks of wood?

Id: [0x002BD9D6]
I remember one nearby. A sad hole where men soak their unhappiness.

Id: [0x002BD9D7]
I remember one nearby. A sad hole where men soak their unhappiness.

Id: [0x002BD9DC]
(coughing fit)

Id: [0x002BDAB1]
Hm?

Id: [0x002BDAB4]
I'm leaving for Mercia. Going home.

Id: [0x002BDAB5]
I'm leaving for Mercia. Going home.

Id: [0x002BDAB6]
Thank you, king. I--

Id: [0x002BDAB7]
Thank you, king. I--

Id: [0x002BDB10]
You are traitorous worms, but Eivor seems to think you deserve pity. So I will give it this once.

Id: [0x002BDB12]
That's it. And I know just who to speak with. Hjorr of Jorvik. He'll know what we need.

Id: [0x002BDB13]
That's it. And I know just who to speak with. Hjorr of Jorvik. He'll know what we need.

Id: [0x002BDB36]
How else can I honor my jarl, old as I am? This is no country for me. The future is yours, Vili.

Id: [0x002BDB37]
The flames of this pyre will burn for my father. You must live! I forbid you to follow him into death.

Id: [0x002BDB3A]
You fight with impressive skill, I should say. I taught you well, I think.

Id: [0x002BDB3C]
No, I am certain I saved you from a snowdrift once. And a murderous tree. That's how I remember it.

Id: [0x002BDB3E]
You taught me how to fight empty air, Vili. And trees and snowdrifts and the like.

Id: [0x002BDB3F]
You taught me how to fight empty air, Vili. And trees and snowdrifts and the like.

Id: [0x002BDB4F]
This is no small decision, Trygve, and not without great cost. The shire will be diminished without you.

Id: [0x002BDB50]
This is no small decision, Trygve, and not without great cost. The shire will be diminished without you.

Id: [0x002BDB59]
I will stay. You have wisdom, Eivor. More than I could have guessed.

Id: [0x002BDB8C]
As are you, Vili. Our lives belong to us.

Id: [0x002BDB8D]
As are you, Vili. Our lives belong to us.

Id: [0x002BDB8E]
Vili, do not misplace your anger on friends who speak what they believe is truth.

Id: [0x002BDB90]
[sigh]Do as you must, Trygve. I … I will miss you, old friend.

Id: [0x002BDB94]
Hemming would be pleased with our gift.

Id: [0x002BDB95]
Hemming will be pleased with our gift.

Id: [0x002BDBCB]
Wild and reckless. Like our first battles together. Remember, the island north of Stavenger?

Id: [0x002BDBCC]
Wild and reckless. Like our first battles together. Remember, the island north of Stavenger?

Id: [0x002BDBCE]
[sigh]Were you glad to hear from me?

Id: [0x002BDBD3]
Well, you have your answer. I'd sooner take after a troll and leave this clan in your hands.

Id: [0x002BDBD6]
I did wonder what trouble you had been up to.

Id: [0x002BDBD7]
I did wonder what trouble you had been up to.

Id: [0x002BDBD9]
[sigh]When my father was named jarl, he had no one to help him and still he triumphed.

Id: [0x002BDBDB]
Hey! What is that for?

Id: [0x002BDBE0]
But I am not my father. I … I simply want to roam.

Id: [0x002BDBE7]
You have friends, Vili. You have family and clan.

Id: [0x002BDBE8]
You have friends, Vili. You have family and clan.

Id: [0x002BDBE9]
You can't roam forever.[beat] Keep that in mind.

Id: [0x002BDBEA]
You can't roam forever.[beat] Keep that in mind.

Id: [0x002BDBEB]
You are surrounded by those who love you.

Id: [0x002BDBEC]
You are surrounded by those who love you.

Id: [0x002BDBEF]
And that will not change unless you push it all away.

Id: [0x002BDBF0]
And that will not change unless you push it all away.

Id: [0x002BDBF4]
Of course, I know that.

Id: [0x002BDBF5]
You have friends, Vili. And what about Trygve? And me? And your clan?

Id: [0x002BDBF6]
You have friends, Vili. And what about Trygve? And me? And your clan?

Id: [0x002BDBFA]
You … you speak a truth I understand.

Id: [0x002BDC0C]
[laugh]A chicken draugr? Is such a thing possible? For that does not seem possible!

Id: [0x002BDC0F]
Do you ever wonder what might have happened if we had not been separated by the North Sea so early in our lives?

Id: [0x002BDC15]
I … I want you, Eivor. Your warmth. Your touch.

Id: [0x002BDC1F]
Voda too! A water infused with fire. I do not lie.

Id: [0x002BDC20]
Voda too! A water infused with fire. I do not lie.

Id: [0x002BDC21]
I have, fondly. And often enough that it sometimes seemed you never left. Maybe you never did.

Id: [0x002BDC22]
I have, fondly. And often enough that it sometimes seemed you never left. Maybe you never did.

Id: [0x002BDC23]
No … I never dwell on our past that way. I find it slows me down to a crawl. And I am not made for crawling.

Id: [0x002BDC24]
No … I never dwell on our past that way. I find it slows me down to a crawl. And I am not made for crawling.

Id: [0x002BDC2A]
Shut up, Vili.

Id: [0x002BDC2B]
Shut up, Vili.

Id: [0x002BDC33]
Vili … no. That will not happen. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002BDC34]
Vili … no. That will not happen. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002BDC4A]
Look at this. Your chin-grass might be mistaken for hedges now.

Id: [0x002BDC4B]
Look at this. Your chin-grass might be mistaken for hedges now.

Id: [0x002BDC4C]
I would have come with warriors at my back if I knew Vili was at war.

Id: [0x002BDC4D]
I would have come with warriors at my back if I knew Vili was at war.

Id: [0x002BDC4E]
Off looking for a fight. I should have known.

Id: [0x002BDC4F]
Off looking for a fight. I should have known.

Id: [0x002BDC50]
Not a bad way to live.

Id: [0x002BDC51]
Not a bad way to live.

Id: [0x002BDC52]
How could that be? Hemming Jarl is an ox.

Id: [0x002BDC53]
How could that be? Hemming Jarl is an ox.

Id: [0x002BDC54]
Kind of you. I've been … somewhat lost, truth be told. With Ceolbert … gone, the world seems to have … lost a shade of color.

Id: [0x002BDC6C]
I know something of this feeling. I lost my father, my mother, my entire clan.

Id: [0x002BDC6D]
I know something of this feeling. I lost my father, my mother, my entire clan.

Id: [0x002BDC6E]
He respected you, Eivor. If not for you, he might have remained just as you found him. A naive boy, devoid of experience.

Id: [0x002BDC70]
Not naive. He simply saw the good in people. Wanted to draw it out.

Id: [0x002BDC71]
Not naive. He simply saw the good in people. Wanted to draw it out.

Id: [0x002BDC74]
Of course not. I'm grateful that you have come.

Id: [0x002BDC7A]
May God bless you, Eivor. Whatever remains of my son in this world, I believe it travels with you.

Id: [0x002BDC7E]
That he did…

Id: [0x002BDC87]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002BDC88]
There you are. Are we ready to march?

Id: [0x002BDC8E]
Today, you do not fight for me. Not for each other. Today, you fight for your children.

Id: [0x002BDCA0]
My clan fought well, did they not? You saw it, the heart in these people. How they rallied behind their jarl.

Id: [0x002BDCA4]
Others will name Trygve. A fine man with a mind for leadership, but his lineage is tattered, and he is less bold.

Id: [0x002BDCA5]
Was it Vili who summoned me? Or you, Hemming?

Id: [0x002BDCA6]
Was it Vili who summoned me? Or you, Hemming?

Id: [0x002BDCAD]
Is this how it must be between us?

Id: [0x002BDCAE]
Is this how it must be between us?

Id: [0x002BDCBA]
I watch them, study them, learn from them at all times. This is our duty, the Hidden Ones' calling.

Id: [0x002BDCC5]
King Aelfred has chosen his replacement, but has not yet announced the name. I must know it …  now.

Id: [0x002BDCC7]
Intercept him and bring me the news. When I know the thegn's name, we'll discuss how I might win his favor.

Id: [0x002BDCC8]
What have you promised him?

Id: [0x002BDCC9]
What have you promised him?

Id: [0x002BDCCA]
Fight me!

Id: [0x002BDCCC]
Your corpse hall is nothing but a dream!

Id: [0x002BDCCD]
Your corpse hall is nothing but a dream!

Id: [0x002BDCD2]
Is that … Is that Svala? Valka's mother? How did she come to be here?

Id: [0x002BDCD3]
Is that … Is that Svala? Valka's mother? How did she come to be here?

Id: [0x002BDCD9]
I told you, Eivor. My visions are memories. Of a life once lived. Come.

Id: [0x002BDCF2]
Eivor, what is it?

Id: [0x002BDCF4]
No!

Id: [0x002BDCF5]
No!

Id: [0x002BDCF8]
Valhalla. That is where I am bound. I can smell the blood and taste the mead. I will sit beside the high one with my axe in hand.

Id: [0x002BDCFB]
He wants an heir. It's a common dream.

Id: [0x002BDCFC]
He wants an heir. It's a common dream.

Id: [0x002BDCFD]
Not for a warrior! Not for drengir like us! He was different before. But this place, England … it softened him.

Id: [0x002BDD07]
Mine is not the usual path. The creed does travel. Our ideals are universal, we believe that.

Id: [0x002BDD09]
No place I call home. No.

Id: [0x002BDD0B]
Parents, brothers, all dead.

Id: [0x002BDD0D]
There is always one unbreakable bond.

Id: [0x002BDD0E]
Children, they bewilder you. They can cause you so much worry, fill you with joy. Even stop your heart. And if you're lucky, they replace you.

Id: [0x002BDD0F]
I was not so lucky. I had a son. I miss him terribly. Even now.

Id: [0x002BDD11]
He was taken from me. By someone I trusted. A friend, a mentor. A man who I would trust with anything.

Id: [0x002BDD12]
But a man you trust with anything … can take everything.

Id: [0x002BDD13]
He took all I had.

Id: [0x002BDD14]
You've traveled so far to carry out your duty. Is this the life of a Hidden One? Always on the move?

Id: [0x002BDD15]
You've traveled so far to carry out your duty. Is this the life of a Hidden One? Always on the move?

Id: [0x002BDD16]
Is there nowhere you call home?

Id: [0x002BDD17]
Is there nowhere you call home?

Id: [0x002BDD18]
No one? Not even Hytham?

Id: [0x002BDD19]
No one? Not even Hytham?

Id: [0x002BDD1A]
I lost my parents when I was nine winters along. Without Sigurd, I would've… I would've.

Id: [0x002BDD1B]
I lost my parents when I was nine winters along. Without Sigurd, I would've… I would've.

Id: [0x002BDD1C]
I'm sorry, Basim.

Id: [0x002BDD1D]
I'm sorry, Basim.

Id: [0x002BDD25]
A slaughter must be made. Many sheep at the bottom of the Sleeping Jotun, before the pyre is lit.

Id: [0x002BDD4D]
Fret not, friend. I have a nose for these things. Seek out the exile. He'll see to your shield.

Id: [0x002BDD5D]
Do not seek answers to your questions. They will find you.

Id: [0x002BDE1A]
My sight and exile. That was our compromise.

Id: [0x002BDE1C]
Hm.

Id: [0x002BDE1E]
Hemming Jarl possessed a steady hand and steady heart. Do you possess the same?

Id: [0x002BDE21]
I was told you are a master craftsman. I seek an etching on this shield, to celebrate the life and death of Hemming Jarl.

Id: [0x002BDE22]
I was told you are a master craftsman. I seek an etching on this shield, to celebrate the life and death of Hemming Jarl.

Exotic rugs from a faraway land. These must be worth a fortune.

Exotic rugs from a faraway land. These must be worth a fortune.

Id: [0x002BDE95]
Save my wife, please. Leave me be!

Id: [0x002BDEC5]
Aaaah!

Id: [0x002BDEC6]
Your King Rhodri's in there, begging on his chubby knees for peace!

Id: [0x002BDEC7]
Go on…

Id: [0x002BDEC8]
There's nobody in this world that Tedmund cares more for than Tedmund. I could think on it, but we haven't much time.

Id: [0x002BDED3]
Have you? And what did they foretell?

Id: [0x002BDED5]
It is hard to say. I've seen Odin leading me into shadows. I've seen spinners weaving wild destinies from pools of blood.

Id: [0x002BDED6]
It is hard to say. I've seen Odin leading me into shadows. I've seen spinners weaving wild destinies from pools of blood.

Id: [0x002BDED7]
Go on…

Id: [0x002BDEDA]
I see…

Id: [0x002BDEDC]
Valka warned me of a great betrayal. But what form it takes, I cannot say.

Id: [0x002BDEDD]
Valka warned me of a great betrayal. But what form it takes, I cannot say.

Id: [0x002BDEDE]
I hold to my oaths Sigurd, you know that. Betrayal is not in my nature.

Id: [0x002BDEDF]
I hold to my oaths Sigurd, you know that. Betrayal is not in my nature.

Id: [0x002BDEE1]
But your rescue attempt will not have the same flair. Is it worth it?

Id: [0x002BDEE2]
But your rescue attempt will not have the same flair. Is it worth it?

Id: [0x002BDF09]
Over here, this plate will lead us onward.

Id: [0x002BDF24]
Next time I lose this fucking arm, I'll beat a man to death with it!

Id: [0x002BDF3D]
Your sorry king wants peace.[spit]

Id: [0x002BDF42]
Ah, yes, and quite a fearsome one at that.

Id: [0x002BDF44]
Indeed. The Lady Fulke passed this way not more than a month ago. We talked, we drank. A very pleasant woman.

Id: [0x002BDF47]
Eivor will be your axe, abbot. Whether to fell a tree or hew the limbs from an enemy.

Id: [0x002BDF49]
Basim says you know the paladin, Fulke.

Id: [0x002BDF4A]
Basim says you know the paladin, Fulke.

Id: [0x002BDF4B]
And where is she--

Id: [0x002BDF4C]
And where is she--

Id: [0x002BDF4D]
If the abbot does not deliver Fulke, he will die at my hand, and we will continue our search.

Id: [0x002BDF4F]
They could learn. The Church could teach them. So much of human history would be opened to them.

Id: [0x002BDF50]
I believe it is.

Id: [0x002BDF51]
Thralls and ceorls cannot read. What would be the point?

Id: [0x002BDF52]
Thralls and ceorls cannot read. What would be the point?

Id: [0x002BDF53]
How many of your clan know the true circumstances of Sigurd's absence?

Id: [0x002BDF56]
Mmm.

Id: [0x002BDF57]
Mmm.

Id: [0x002BDF58]
It can feel like one. You truly embrace the concept of hiding in plain sight, eh? To its very fullest.

Id: [0x002BDF59]
It can feel like one. You truly embrace the concept of hiding in plain sight, eh? To its very fullest.

Id: [0x002BDF5B]
I wish to help you to peace.

Id: [0x002BDF5C]
I wish to help you to peace.

Id: [0x002BDF5D]
(whimper)

Id: [0x002BDF60]
I cannot be purchased with looted silver, Dane. Stand away.

Id: [0x002BDF61]
Halt Danes! In the name of Aelfred, King of Wessex, I demand you release his royal subject into my care!

Id: [0x002BDF63]
Come no closer, Christian! Else your man dies by my blade!

Id: [0x002BDF65]
Please! I'm not the man you want.

Id: [0x002BDF6C]
Have you made a decision at last? Ivarr is increasingly agitated.

Id: [0x002BDF83]
Shergar, has the fortress any weaknesses? Any breaches or water wells we might use?

Id: [0x002BDF84]
Shergar, has the fortress any weaknesses? Any breaches or water wells we might use?

Id: [0x002BDF85]
Suck on yellow snow! Filthy Danes.

Id: [0x002BDF86]
Briton cowards! All of you!

Id: [0x002BDF87]
Peace? Who wants peace?

Id: [0x002BDF88]
Come on, then. Let's have at it.

Id: [0x002BDF89]
We'll festoon our halls with your entrails!

Id: [0x002BDF8A]
Acting as Tedmund, I ordered a band of soldiers to capture them. If you hurry, you may be able to stop this.

Id: [0x002BDF8D]
That must be it.

Id: [0x002BDF8E]
That must be it.

Id: [0x002BDF96]
Sorry, no. Leave them here. Tied up. As a … a feast for wolves and crows.

Id: [0x002BDF97]
That is all. You may depart. Shoo.

Id: [0x002BDF9E]
What is your name, warrior?

Id: [0x002BDF9F]
What is your name, warrior?

Id: [0x002BDFA6]
Wallace, I have something for you.

Id: [0x002BDFA7]
Wallace, I have something for you.

Id: [0x002BDFA9]
All seems in order. At first new light, I will leave.

Id: [0x002BDFAC]
Good. That gives us time to drink.

Id: [0x002BDFAD]
Good. That gives us time to drink.

Id: [0x002BDFB7]
Eivor! Stand!

Id: [0x002BDFB9]
Back on your feet!

Id: [0x002BDFBA]
Rise up, warrior.

Id: [0x002BDFBB]
Join us. We are here for you.

Id: [0x002BDFBD]
Fucking wolves.

Id: [0x002BDFBE]
Cursed wolves.

Id: [0x002BDFBF]
Rhodri's nothing but a stinking pile of sheep dung.

Id: [0x002BDFC0]
You come over here and say that!

Id: [0x002BDFC1]
Come on. Take a swing at me. A good swing.

Id: [0x002BDFC2]
This isn't your fight, Danes. Go back to the sea.

Id: [0x002BDFC3]
Poor Danes. So far from home. Who's with your wives now, eh?

Id: [0x002BDFC5]
This guard's throat has been cut!

Id: [0x002BDFC6]
Open up! Tewdwr?

Id: [0x002BDFC7]
What's happened here? Open this door!

Id: [0x002BDFC8]
Come out of there!

Id: [0x002BDFCC]
Mm. Better.

Id: [0x002BDFCD]
Mm. Better.

Id: [0x002BDFCF]
[gasping]Air … I need … I need air!

Id: [0x002BDFD0]
(gasping)

Id: [0x002BDFD1]
Many great kings and paranoids have carried poison in times of war. As an alternative to capture. And ransom.

Id: [0x002BDFD2]
I understand.

Id: [0x002BDFD4]
Agreed.

Id: [0x002BDFD5]
Agreed.

Id: [0x002BDFD8]
Come. Supper's ready.

Id: [0x002BDFDC]
It's early for supper, I know. But Cynebert's ale goes so well with roasted lamb and cinnamon-blueberry-peas.

Id: [0x002BDFDE]
Is he … is he not here? Mon Dieu (My God). I never told him.

Id: [0x002BDFE1]
Of course you have. Isn't that the way of this ugly world?

Id: [0x002BDFE2]
Most who walk the earth are little more than talking blood-bladders. Wasted flesh. But not Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BDFE4]
I give thanks for victory and ask penance for taking lives.

Id: [0x002BDFE5]
O Ceolbert, your God bores me to death. Have a laugh, we won!

Id: [0x002BDFE6]
And I took no pleasure in it, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002BDFE7]
Eivor and I were made for this, my boy. The song of swords, the blood-mist, the bone-crunch and baring of teeth.

Id: [0x002BDFEA]
Begone, Dane. Your name is not yet known to us.

Id: [0x002BDFEC]
You carry yourself well. In search of something?

Id: [0x002BDFED]
You carry yourself well. In search of something?

Id: [0x002BDFEE]
I could tell you my name, if that's what you seek.

Id: [0x002BDFEF]
I could tell you my name, if that's what you seek.

Id: [0x002BDFF1]
Bishop, greetings. We've the makings for a delicious soup!

Id: [0x002BDFF2]
Bishop, we must prepare for Rhodri's arrival. Rally our men and set up a camp just here.

Id: [0x002BDFF3]
Bishop, we must prepare for Rhodri's arrival. Rally our men and set up a camp just here.

Id: [0x002BDFF9]
To old friends.

Id: [0x002BDFFA]
This really is delicious, Cynebert. Is it cloves I taste?

Id: [0x002BE001]
Kill them. And bring their bodies to my sanctum in Canterbury.

Id: [0x002BE004]
Dear God, we're in trouble. Watch out over there, men! O, Christ in holy Heaven.

Id: [0x002BE006]
Here they come! Quick, men, or they'll wipe us out!

Id: [0x002BE00A]
Spread out around to the side of 'em, lads! Stay on your toes, or we'll be on the gibbet!

Id: [0x002BE010]
A striking color. Is it rare?

Id: [0x002BE011]
A striking color. Is it rare?

Id: [0x002BE013]
O yes, and you needn't even thank me! We would be honored to call this our home. Good day!

Id: [0x002BE014]
You are staying for a while, I suppose?

Id: [0x002BE015]
You are staying for a while, I suppose?

Id: [0x002BE031]
From the look of this camp they've been gone for some time. Where will you go now? What will you do?

Id: [0x002BE039]
Rebuild my stocks. Start anew. I have friends and allies across the land to aid me but … it won't be easy.

Id: [0x002BE03B]
Every town and village needs a stable. To keep horses fit and trim. I'll find my footing again. Somewhere.

Id: [0x002BE03D]
What are you thinking?

Id: [0x002BE054]
Whatever you think is best, Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BE055]
Yanli, Rowan … I am Sigurd Jarl of Fornberg, son of Styrbjorn. This is Eivor … and Dag.

Id: [0x002BE057]
We'd be happy to. If only to get back on our feet.

Id: [0x002BE059]
Then let it be done. The Raven Clan welcomes you.

Id: [0x002BE05C]
Peace, friend. We have no need or wish to hurt you. What are your names?

Id: [0x002BE05E]
Have they given their jarl a fine farewell?

Id: [0x002BE060]
They have. None drink so well and so deeply as Clan Hemmingson.

Id: [0x002BE061]
They have. None drink so well and so deeply as Clan Hemmingson.

Id: [0x002BE06E]
I stand before you as Vili Hemmingson, but not as a jarl. There is only one man with the needed honor and wisdom.

Id: [0x002BE06F]
Only one man my father deemed worthy of following him.

Id: [0x002BE07D]
Ascend the Sleeping Jotun. Consume the waters. And meditate at its peak.

Id: [0x002BE0FC]
I have. More than enough.

Id: [0x002BE0FD]
I have. More than enough.

Id: [0x002BE125]
I will get the man, Eivor. You carry the woman!

Id: [0x002BE131]
You are small to my eyes, stranger.

Id: [0x002BE133]
Your name is known to me. But what could mighty Suttungr want that a little thing like you can provide?

Id: [0x002BE138]
Well spoken, Havi. Our people may be enemies, but you have earned your welcome here.

Id: [0x002BE13B]
Small in stature but great in deed. I am the one they call Havi, the High One of Asgard, and I come bearing a great gift.

Id: [0x002BE13C]
Small in stature but great in deed. I am the one they call Havi, the High One of Asgard, and I come bearing a great gift.

Id: [0x002BE13D]
Your great cauldron, stolen by Hymir's sons. Let this offering be a beginning to the end of our hostilities.

Id: [0x002BE13E]
Your great cauldron, stolen by Hymir's sons. Let this offering be a beginning to the end of our hostilities.

Id: [0x002BE13F]
Such a small thing, yet so much deeper than it seems. Appearances can be deceiving, can they not?

Id: [0x002BE140]
Such a small thing, yet so much deeper than it seems. Appearances can be deceiving, can they not?

Id: [0x002BE146]
Thralls! An honored guest has come! Prepare a feast!

Id: [0x002BE14D]
I hope also to meet your daughter, Gunlodr. I have heard much of her skill in the mystical arts.

Id: [0x002BE14E]
I hope also to meet your daughter, Gunlodr. I have heard much of her skill in the mystical arts.

Id: [0x002BE19D]
Guards! Help! Help!

Id: [0x002BE2E2]
How nice. Are you enjoying yourself?

Id: [0x002BE2E4]
Enraptured by anything, for that matter. He's a hard one to read. But I am pleased for him. And for this day of rest and respite.

Id: [0x002BE2E5]
After everything, a few days of feasting will do the people some good. They need this.

Id: [0x002BE2E8]
Will you walk with me?

Id: [0x002BE2EA]
I am. I never thought I would see gruff old Gunnar so enraptured by a woman.

Id: [0x002BE2EB]
I am. I never thought I would see gruff old Gunnar so enraptured by a woman.

Id: [0x002BE2EE]
Anywhere. Lead on.

Id: [0x002BE2EF]
Anywhere. Lead on.

Id: [0x002BE2F5]
Rhodri has another secret supply line. Ask among the refugees near the river. Those who have fled from occupied villages.

Id: [0x002BE2F6]
Something has been on my mind for some time.

Id: [0x002BE2F8]
I am no seer, but I foresaw this day long ago. Not Gunnar's marriage, but our situation. Our success.

Id: [0x002BE2FA]
I mean to say that I saw our settlement flourishing, through our victories in war and in diplomacy.

Id: [0x002BE2FB]
And from the day we set out from Norway, I knew that you would make a fitter leader than Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BE2FD]
Do you?

Id: [0x002BE2FF]
You would not have listened.

Id: [0x002BE301]
I do hope you see it now, in all that you have done for us.

Id: [0x002BE302]
As I am honored by your love.

Id: [0x002BE303]
As I am honored by your friendship.

Id: [0x002BE307]
How do you mean our success?

Id: [0x002BE308]
How do you mean our success?

Id: [0x002BE309]
I see.

Id: [0x002BE30A]
I see.

Id: [0x002BE30B]
You might have warned me.

Id: [0x002BE30C]
You might have warned me.

Id: [0x002BE30D]
Fair.

Id: [0x002BE30E]
Fair.

Id: [0x002BE30F]
And I by yours.

Id: [0x002BE310]
And I by yours.

Id: [0x002BE311]
I will not talk of peace until my brother Gwriad, is returned to me.

Id: [0x002BE313]
If you first agree to peace, he will be returned. Would a sum of silver help overleap this difficulty?

Id: [0x002BE314]
If you first agree to peace, he will be returned. Would a sum of silver help overleap this difficulty?

Id: [0x002BE315]
The Saxons won't welcome us through the front door. We could find a quiet way in, or we can take your longship. I'm beside you either way.

Id: [0x002BE317]
The soldiers' barracks. Aethelswith might be here.

Id: [0x002BE319]
I should challenge you for such a betrayal, but I'm … I'm not fit for such a fight.

Id: [0x002BE31D]
It was a trying time.

Id: [0x002BE31E]
It was a trying time.

Id: [0x002BE336]
If we ever cross paths again, I know you are someone I can count on. I hope you know the same is true for me.

Id: [0x002BE337]
Take care of yourself, Eivor. The world is a dangerous place.

Id: [0x002BE372]
"Hen shit," I say. Rhodri laughs and lets me go.

Id: [0x002BE374]
We will take it from him, a full assault.

Id: [0x002BE376]
There's the fortress ahead.

Id: [0x002BE377]
There's the fortress ahead.

Id: [0x002BE378]
That will shed many barrels of blood.

Id: [0x002BE379]
That will shed many barrels of blood.

Id: [0x002BE37B]
Rhodri is holed up there, drinking ale and humping serving girls.

Id: [0x002BE37D]
Anything worth doing must be paid for in blood.

Id: [0x002BE37E]
Pleased with his treachery.

Id: [0x002BE37F]
Pleased with his treachery.

Id: [0x002BE38D]
I know you are eager to get moving, but I have things I must first take care of.

Id: [0x002BE38E]
I know you are eager to get moving, but I have things I must first take care of.

Id: [0x002BE390]
I'm ready. Let's head out.

Id: [0x002BE391]
I'm ready. Let's head out.

Id: [0x002BE397]
What better place to put a line of poetry, hm?

Id: [0x002BE3CE]
To encourage trade so that our forces would be rich and strong if called upon. Guthrum agreed.

Id: [0x002BE3D0]
A traitor or no, the bastard is also one of my closest people, my friend. My family.

Id: [0x002BE3D2]
Wanderers, smugglers, and craftsmen alike.

Id: [0x002BE3D8]
Peace or war will be decided, but not yet, not now. We must wait.

Id: [0x002BE3DA]
It is all in God's hands. We can but pray and give thanks for this moment of rest.

Id: [0x002BE3DC]
The Britons have come!

Id: [0x002BE3DE]
I loathe waiting.

Id: [0x002BE3DF]
I loathe waiting.

Id: [0x002BE3E0]
The moment has ended.

Id: [0x002BE3E1]
The moment has ended.

Id: [0x002BE3E2]
On a point like the tip of a blade, we teetered there, gripping one another. Tightly.

Id: [0x002BE3E3]
To you, my darling, Brigid, I offer this blade, forged in flames that burn as brightly as my heart does for you.

Id: [0x002BE3E4]
A blade as sharp as your wit, as glinting as your beauty. May it sing through the air as sweetly as your voice meets my ears.

Id: [0x002BE3E5]
(unintelligible)[Gods, how I adore you, Gunnar. I am ever so lucky to have found you my love.]

Id: [0x002BE3E6]
And I you. I give you my sword and my promise that I will stand at your side forever.

Id: [0x002BE3E7]
(unintelligible)[Long have I dreamed of my own future, and sought solace in hope and premonition.]

Id: [0x002BE3E8]
(unintelligible)[You are a soul like none other. A man as strong as he is gentle and as kind as he is fierce. My heart soars alongside yours.]

Id: [0x002BE3E9]
Such poetry, O dear! You make me cry, my love.

Id: [0x002BE3EA]
(unintelligible)[Let us fly together, through this life and beyond.]

Id: [0x002BE3EB]
I offer you this ring, and take yours in kind. I will wear it with pride and honor, warmed by the love of so perfect a lady.

Id: [0x002BE3EC]
(unintelligible)[And I will wear it with love, adoration, and faith everlasting.]

Id: [0x002BE3ED]
This is the greatest day of my life! Embrace me, my love!

Id: [0x002BE3EE]
I struggled. Then Soma appeared, and she eased my burden.

Id: [0x002BE3EF]
This way. By the great oak.

Id: [0x002BE3F0]
Where is Ceolbert? He ought to be present for these talks, as our future ealdorman.

Id: [0x002BE3F1]
He went hunting. For wild boar, he said.

Id: [0x002BE3F2]
That was quite some time ago, no?

Id: [0x002BE3F3]
Up, Eivor! Up!

Id: [0x002BE3F4]
Rise, drengr. This is not your end.

Id: [0x002BE3F7]
Lady Angharad, greetings!

Id: [0x002BE3F8]
We come to speak of peace.

Id: [0x002BE3F9]
We are gladdened to hear it. But where is your great king?

Id: [0x002BE3FA]
He stays at the castle at my behest. I feared his presence would inflame the cutthroat, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002BE3FC]
Perhaps, then, at long last we can end this war. Our peoples have suffered enough.

Id: [0x002BE3FF]
We cannot wait. We should settle the peace now.

Id: [0x002BE400]
We cannot wait. We should settle the peace now.

Id: [0x002BE403]
And your proposal?

Id: [0x002BE404]
And your proposal?

Id: [0x002BE406]
We shall withdraw all our soldiers to the time-honored border of our lands.

Id: [0x002BE407]
In return, you pledge to end all hostilities as of this moment.

Id: [0x002BE40A]
Truly.

Id: [0x002BE40B]
Praise be, this is well and quickly done! God go with you and your king, Lady Angharad.

Id: [0x002BE40C]
I salute you all. You waged a good war. Let us now wage a lasting peace.

Id: [0x002BE40D]
I stand bewildered, Eivor. In the blink of an eye, years of blood and sweat are put to an end.

Id: [0x002BE40F]
Ceolbert must learn the good news. Will you tell him when you see him?

Id: [0x002BE411]
These terms are generous. We have a truce.

Id: [0x002BE412]
These terms are generous. We have a truce.

Id: [0x002BE415]
You've walked a difficult road, bishop.

Id: [0x002BE416]
You've walked a difficult road, bishop.

Id: [0x002BE417]
I'll find him now.

Id: [0x002BE418]
I'll find him now.

Id: [0x002BE426]
Guards! Help! Help!

Id: [0x002BE427]
Wigmund should have killed you all off the first time!

Id: [0x002BE43F]
That's not true.

Id: [0x002BE444]
My men are loading a cart with cauldrons of oil. We will blast right through that fucking gate.

Id: [0x002BE44E]
Get the cart, boys. We will light it up in front of the gate!

Id: [0x002BE45B]
The walls of his fortress will not protect him. I will sheath this dagger into his lungs!

Id: [0x002BE45C]
Huh? How did you escape?

Id: [0x002BE464]
There you are.

Id: [0x002BE466]
What happened out there?

Id: [0x002BE467]
The Ragnarssons came through, just like Tonna said they would.

Id: [0x002BE468]
I suppose they didn't reach an agreement.

Id: [0x002BE469]
Ha. What gave it away?

Id: [0x002BE46A]
She ordered me to lock the door, ripped the key straight out of my hand.

Id: [0x002BE470]
Did you find the … the ring?

Id: [0x002BE476]
And you hold it out like this and look him in the eyes and you say, "Styrbjorn King, may our clans be forever bonded in friendship and in love."

Id: [0x002BE478]
You think you can do that for me?

Id: [0x002BE47A]
Give it here.

Id: [0x002BE47C]
My father asked me, Sigurd.

Id: [0x002BE47D]
Suit yourself.

Id: [0x002BE47F]
Now, you're a curious one. A cowl and robes hiding tawny skin. And that devilish blade…

Id: [0x002BE484]
Fulke…

Id: [0x002BE485]
Fulke…

Id: [0x002BE487]
This was Eadwyn's doing, I have no doubt.

Id: [0x002BE489]
May you live as one with the true God, in the Treasury of Light.

Id: [0x002BE493]
Hemming Jarl desired for me to live. The villagers … did not.

Id: [0x002BE497]
That will lead you astray, Eivor.

Id: [0x002BE499]
Come, friend. We have a battle to prepare for.

Id: [0x002BE4AD]
Let's end this before that flap-mouthed pudding has a chance to hit back.

Id: [0x002BE4FF]
Havi, your feast is prepared. I hope it pleases you.

Id: [0x002BE501]
Father, you know revelry does not suit me. Must I attend this feast? I have work to do.

Id: [0x002BE502]
Your work can wait, my daughter. Take a moment, enjoy yourself.

Id: [0x002BE50A]
You are generous and hospitable indeed, great Suttungr. None can say otherwise.

Id: [0x002BE50B]
You are generous and hospitable indeed, great Suttungr. None can say otherwise.

Id: [0x002BE510]
And see, your gift stands in pride of place, brimming with freshly fermented mead. Enough for a hundred Jotnar and more!

Id: [0x002BE512]
My cauldron is deep, but my vault is deeper. Do not worry about my stores of mead. I have plenty to go around.

Id: [0x002BE513]
This is … an unexpected honor. You have filled it already with mead from your vault, then?

Id: [0x002BE514]
This is … an unexpected honor. You have filled it already with mead from your vault, then?

Id: [0x002BE587]
Ah! A final act of courage. Very well…

Id: [0x002BE588]
I accept. We settle this now.

Id: [0x002BE589]
I accept. We settle this now.

Id: [0x002BE58B]
This is not a question, Eivor. Come.

Id: [0x002BE58C]
This is madness, Dag. That I do not accept.

Id: [0x002BE58D]
This is madness, Dag. That I do not accept.

Id: [0x002BE591]
Kjotve's warriors crawl through Avaldsnes like lice.

Id: [0x002BE592]
Kjotve's warriors crawl through Avaldsnes like lice.

Id: [0x002BE593]
If I use the main gate, I may attract attention.

Id: [0x002BE594]
If I use the main gate, I may attract attention.

Id: [0x002BE596]
With our couple now bonded in matrimony … now we drink!

Id: [0x002BE597]
With our couple now bonded in matrimony … now we drink!

Id: [0x002BE5A8]
And new alike.

Id: [0x002BE5AA]
I thought you would come faster if it was Vili's name you heard first. I need your wisdom, Eivor. Your discretion.

Id: [0x002BE5B7]
Ha! That we would.

Id: [0x002BE5B8]
For the love of Saint Cuthbert, free me!

Id: [0x002BE5BA]
These men will fight for us.

Id: [0x002BE5BB]
These men will fight for us.

Id: [0x002BE5CC]
Destroy the gate!

Id: [0x002BE5CD]
Destroy the gate!

Id: [0x002BE5CE]
Gate's down! Push through! Push through!

Id: [0x002BE5CF]
Gate's down! Push through! Push through!

Id: [0x002BE5D0]
The path is blocked. We must destroy that barricade!

Id: [0x002BE5D1]
The path is blocked. We must destroy that barricade!

Id: [0x002BE5D2]
Protect the ram!

Id: [0x002BE5D3]
Protect the ram!

Id: [0x002BE5D4]
Cut down their marksmen and elites! Or they'll thin us out, one by one!

Id: [0x002BE5D5]
Cut down their marksmen and elites! Or they'll thin us out, one by one!

Id: [0x002BE5D6]
It's over, Burgred! Lay down your weapons and surrender.

Id: [0x002BE5D7]
It's over, Burgred! Lay down your weapons and surrender.

Id: [0x002BE5DA]
Sigurd has come! Down at the docks, his ship is here!

Id: [0x002BE5E2]
Burn the houses to cinders! Leave them no place to hide!

Id: [0x002BE5E3]
Burgred! I'll find you, you little rat! Do you hear me!

Id: [0x002BE5E4]
Slaughter the soldiers! Leave the king to me!

Id: [0x002BE5E5]
No need! It has filled itself. Such is the magic of the cauldron.

Id: [0x002BE5EB]
Impressive. But what if it should run out of mead?

Id: [0x002BE5EC]
Impressive. But what if it should run out of mead?

Id: [0x002BE5F4]
How is all this possible?

Id: [0x002BE5F5]
How is all this possible?

Id: [0x002BE5F8]
It is nothing, go! Kill that bacraut!

Id: [0x002BE5F9]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x002BE5FA]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x002BE5FD]
Do not diminish yourself!

Id: [0x002BE5FE]
Nothing but a dream? A dream is as real as anything in this world!

Id: [0x002BE600]
Then I am done with dreaming!

Id: [0x002BE601]
Then I am done with dreaming!

Id: [0x002BE609]
This sad business is finished. And good riddance.

Id: [0x002BE60A]
And now we sail for further shores … to my true purpose. To my destiny. To the end of my road.

Id: [0x002BE60C]
I will follow you as far as you wish in this world, Brother. But if you mean to take us further … I may reconsider.

Id: [0x002BE60D]
I will follow you as far as you wish in this world, Brother. But if you mean to take us further … I may reconsider.

Id: [0x002BE60F]
May our clans be forever bonded in friendship and love.

Id: [0x002BE612]
Bah! I spit on Kjotve. There is none so noble as you, my lord.

Id: [0x002BE665]
Destroy everything. Their roofs to splinters, their bones to dust.

Id: [0x002BE666]
Set Werham ablaze.

Id: [0x002BE667]
Payment for those warriors they have sent to Valhalla.

Id: [0x002BE66A]
They'll not pursue us while they have fires to quell.

Id: [0x002BE66B]
There, this is the blockade. The hostages must be in these buildings. What is your plan?

Id: [0x002BE674]
A holiday feast, their Saxon Christ mass. Aelfred will warm his heels by the fire while Ubba lies cold in an English field.

Id: [0x002BE696]
So some of us are staying behind as I hear it?

Id: [0x002BE697]
Half the army's already in Tamworth, and we've now got help from the south. It's our lot to look after this place now. To protect her.

Id: [0x002BE6A2]
Eivor … is your axe sharpened?

Id: [0x002BE725]
And the thunder of shields, yes! It's good to have you with us.

Id: [0x002BE726]
I'm ready for the spear din.

Id: [0x002BE727]
I'm ready for the spear din.

Id: [0x002BE72C]
Burgred wanted a fight. Now we'll give him one. Are you ready to march now?

Id: [0x002BE72D]
I'm with the Ragnarssons. It's time to roll out the battering ram.

Id: [0x002BE72E]
I'm with the Ragnarssons. It's time to roll out the battering ram.

Id: [0x002BE730]
Eivor. Tell us you learned something.

Id: [0x002BE732]
Hm. Ledecestre is a large village. And Templebrough … it's an old military fort, not much else.

Id: [0x002BE734]
And what do we do with Tonna? I would bet the sweat off my sack she's writing to Burgred now, offering silver for a warning about us.

Id: [0x002BE736]
Ledecestre and Templebrough Fort. What do you know about them?

Id: [0x002BE737]
Ledecestre and Templebrough Fort. What do you know about them?

Id: [0x002BE738]
Burgred could be at either one. We should check both. As soon as possible.

Id: [0x002BE739]
Burgred could be at either one. We should check both. As soon as possible.

Id: [0x002BE73D]
Good timing. We would have stormed the place without you.

Id: [0x002BE73F]
Soldiers aplenty. Wagons going in and out. That weasel Burgred is here, I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x002BE740]
The bathhouse there, and that church, see? I sent a scout to check them both. Should be back at any moment now.

Id: [0x002BE746]
Did you see Ubba and Sigurd in Templebrough?

Id: [0x002BE747]
What have you seen?

Id: [0x002BE748]
What have you seen?

Id: [0x002BE795]
Havi. The guests are uneasy. They see an Aesir, but they do not know you. Will you address them?

Id: [0x002BE79E]
Now we will hear from our honored guest! The Lord of the Aesir has come in peace, and brought us a mighty gift. Attend!

Id: [0x002BE7A6]
Havi, I am called, whose axe is never slaked! The blood of my enemies is my mead, their skulls my pillow!

Id: [0x002BE7A7]
Havi, I am called, whose axe is never slaked! The blood of my enemies is my mead, their skulls my pillow!

Id: [0x002BE7A9]
Turn around, Dane. Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.

Id: [0x002BE7AA]
Didn't you hear me? Back off.

Id: [0x002BE7AC]
I am Havi, dreaded hunter of your kind! One hundred Jotnar have I slain!

Id: [0x002BE7AD]
I am Havi, dreaded hunter of your kind! One hundred Jotnar I have slain!

Id: [0x002BE7AF]
You tread on dangerous ground, Aesir.

Id: [0x002BE7B0]
You brag well. They were ever pleased by violence.

Id: [0x002BE7B1]
There is no river of blood deep enough to keep me from my destiny.

Id: [0x002BE7B3]
I am Havi, deft of tongue and quick of wit, here to spin you a tale!

Id: [0x002BE7B4]
I am Havi, deft of tongue and quick of wit, here to spin you a tale!

Id: [0x002BE7B8]
Your stories are wasted on them. They respect deeds, not hollow talk.

Id: [0x002BE7C7]
All of Mercia can see him now.

Id: [0x002BE7CA]
How was King Harald's feast? Sigurd went home before I could get anything out of him.

Id: [0x002BE7CD]
You are all brothers and sisters to me!

Id: [0x002BE7CE]
You are all brothers and sisters to me!

Id: [0x002BE7D0]
Do not be too familiar. Jotnar are slow to trust.

Id: [0x002BE7D2]
Great Jotnar, I stand here in awe of your might and majesty.

Id: [0x002BE7D3]
Great Jotnar, I stand here in awe of your might and majesty.

Id: [0x002BE7D5]
They do not respect weakness. Show some backbone!

Id: [0x002BE7D7]
Though our people are enemies, I come here to do you honor, for I know that none feast, nor fight like Jotnar.

Id: [0x002BE7D8]
Though our people are enemies, I come here to do you honor, for I know that none feast, nor fight like Jotnar.

Id: [0x002BE7DE]
You men, mount up and follow me! There's work to be done!

Id: [0x002BE7DF]
This saga we have written together, it needs an ending. Here and now.

Id: [0x002BE7E1]
A fight to the death, you and me! If I win, I am the greatest vikingr who ever lived. If I lose, what a tale you have to tell.

Id: [0x002BE7E3]
You are battle-drunk, Ivarr. Goodbye.

Id: [0x002BE7E4]
You are battle-drunk, Ivarr. Goodbye.

Id: [0x002BE7E5]
She'll be wary of who goes in and out of there, at least until this whole thing with Burgred quiets down.

Id: [0x002BE7EA]
(scream)

Id: [0x002BE7EB]
(scream)

Id: [0x002BE7ED]
Your words are well chosen.

Id: [0x002BE7EF]
You sick fucking bacraut (asshole)!

Id: [0x002BE7F0]
You sick fucking bacraut (asshole)!

Id: [0x002BE7FD]
Those with rumbling bellies will not stand for long tales.

Id: [0x002BE7FE]
Now I will sing you the lay of Idunn, whose apples gave life eternal!

Id: [0x002BE7FF]
Now I will sing you the lay of Idunn, whose apples gave life eternal!

Id: [0x002BE804]
You know your audience well, it seems.

Id: [0x002BE805]
I could go on, but who wants to hear words when there's meat and mead to be had?

Id: [0x002BE806]
I could go on, but who wants to hear words when there's meat and mead to be had?

Id: [0x002BE80A]
One last thing. The blizzard that has lately choked your roads and rattled your doors. I have stopped those angry snows for you.

I offer a toast to great Suttungr!

I offer a toast to great Suttungr!

Id: [0x002BE810]
Let the feast begin!

Id: [0x002BE811]
Now we will drink deep and eat heartily!

Id: [0x002BE812]
Now we will drink deep and eat heartily!

Id: [0x002BE858]
They do not love me as much as they love to feast.

Id: [0x002BE85A]
Father, we have very little time--

Id: [0x002BE85B]
Enjoy yourself. I insist.

Id: [0x002BE862]
Bad idea, lovely dove. Now I'm going to make you regret it.

Id: [0x002BE863]
I am taking your head back to the Ragnarssons. That'll teach them to cross me.

Id: [0x002BE86A]
Tonna! We have an intruder!

Id: [0x002BE86C]
What do you think? By land or by water?

Id: [0x002BE86D]
We take a boat in there, it'll cause a stir.

Id: [0x002BE86E]
Is that a bad thing?

Id: [0x002BE873]
Hej, Eivor. I was telling the aetheling here that Thor is with us this day. Our victory is assured.

Id: [0x002BE874]
Ivarr. Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002BE875]
Ivarr. Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002BE879]
In a lecture at the University of Cambridge, Dr. Siercke told a worried audience that scientists have few answers for them…

Id: [0x002BE87D]
Since the mass coronal ejection of 2012, the strength of the earth's magnetic field has increased by a factor of fifty thousand.

Id: [0x002BE87F]
This has resulted in huge disturbances in radio and satellite communications, dangerous bands of radiation around the poles, and as we can all see from our window, an aurora borealis that never burns away.

Id: [0x002BE882]
Unfortunately, we are stumped as to why this is happening. And if we cannot find an answer soon, it may change the way we live, the way we communicate … even the way we evolve … forever.

Id: [0x002BE885]
Dr. Siercke went on to say--

Id: [0x002BE888]
Bought you more electrolytes!

Id: [0x002BE88A]
Ooh! New and improved citrus flavor!

Id: [0x002BE88C]
Thanks, Shaun.

Id: [0x002BE891]
How do we fix this? How are you the key to everything?

Id: [0x002BE8B2]
Smell that, Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002BE8B3]
[sniff]I … I think so. A faint, grassy odor?

Id: [0x002BE8B4]
No, no. The air smells of distant thunder. Thor walks with us.

Id: [0x002BE8B7]
I hope to fight well, not cruelly. The cutting of throats, I leave to you.

Id: [0x002BE8BA]
I am not so drunk I cannot stand but … hang on to me a moment.

Id: [0x002BE8BB]
I should have given him the satisfaction of accepting his offer while he lived.

Id: [0x002BE8C3]
Who says you won't come to enjoy it?

Id: [0x002BE8C4]
Who says you won't come to enjoy it?

Id: [0x002BE8C5]
These men dedicated their lives to bettering all of Snotingham. They died in that service.

Id: [0x002BE8C6]
Now, I humbly pledge my life to following in their path. And I ask each of you to rise.

Id: [0x002BE8C7]
People of Hemthorpe. Of Ulkerthorpe. Of Snotinghamscire. We honor neither Trygve nor my father by continuing to mourn.

Id: [0x002BE8C8]
And be to me what Trygve was to my father. Together, we shall build the world they wished to build.

Id: [0x002BE8D2]
Your burden will get easier to bear. Take your father's seat. And make it your own.

Id: [0x002BE8D3]
Your burden will get easier to bear. Take your father's seat. And make it your own.

Well…

Aye.

Id: [0x002BE8D9]
Aye.

You have already learned that people prefer shorter speeches to long ones, Vili Jarl.

Id: [0x002BE8E4]
You have already learned that people prefer shorter speeches to long ones, Vili Jarl.

Id: [0x002BE913]
You dare wash our beloved Hemming with your filth!

Id: [0x002BE919]
Worry yourself with the wounded here. I will talk to Vili myself.

Id: [0x002BE91A]
Worry yourself with the wounded here. I will talk to Vili myself.

Id: [0x002BE91B]
Gods, have I failed my dear jarl?

Id: [0x002BE91C]
Hemthorpe could burn before the pyre is lit.

Id: [0x002BE95B]
Another attack?

Id: [0x002BE95C]
It's your father! He hasn't got long. Come to the longhouse!

Id: [0x002BE996]
You've got the key … use it.

Id: [0x002BE9EF]
Vili…

Id: [0x002BE9F2]
I'll send for my clan. You call on the nobles of this shire.

Id: [0x002BE9F3]
I'll send for my clan. You call on the nobles of this shire.

Id: [0x002BE9F5]
What an arse-hole…

Id: [0x002BE9FB]
The nobles have begun to arrive. Trygve needs our help to see this through.

Id: [0x002BE9FC]
The nobles have begun to arrive. Trygve needs our help to see this through.

Id: [0x002BE9FF]
This is an outrage!

Id: [0x002BEA00]
Our strong feelings for Hemming come with much grief.

Id: [0x002BEA0D]
What are you gonna do? Fight me for it?

Id: [0x002BEA0E]
That harp does not belong to you, little thief. You should give it back.

Id: [0x002BEA0F]
That harp does not belong to you, little thief. You should give it back.

Id: [0x002BEA10]
Drengr.

Id: [0x002BEA1E]
Ah, the sight of old friends lets my heart rest easy.

Id: [0x002BEA1F]
We came as soon as we heard. Bearing gifts for Hemming Jarl.

Id: [0x002BEA26]
The celebration will last many days. How soon 'til we begin?

Id: [0x002BEA27]
The celebration will last many days. How soon 'til we begin?

Id: [0x002BEA29]
Follow.

Id: [0x002BEA2C]
Your heart is restless. Your mind clouded. You seek more than a guarantee of good omens.

Id: [0x002BEA2E]
You wish to know who would best serve this clan as jarl.

Id: [0x002BEA38]
I seek the gods' wisdom.

Id: [0x002BEA39]
I seek the gods' wisdom.

Id: [0x002BEA3A]
I do. Between Vili and Trygve there is no clear choice.

Id: [0x002BEA3B]
I do. Between Vili and Trygve there is no clear choice.

Id: [0x002BEA46]
The Althing must be held when the week is out and the funeral is done. The nobles of this shire will name Vili the jarl of our clan.

Id: [0x002BEA47]
Good. You handled this well, Trygve.

Id: [0x002BEA48]
Good. You handled this well, Trygve.

Id: [0x002BEA4D]
Did you see that! He flew!

Id: [0x002BEA4F]
No guests in the kitchen! Out!

Id: [0x002BEA51]
Hot spices call for a cooling drink. Now how can I use this?

Id: [0x002BEA52]
Hot spices call for a cooling drink. Now how can I use this?

Id: [0x002BEA54]
These guests will drink more with fire in their mouths.

Id: [0x002BEA55]
These guests will drink more with fire in their mouths.

Id: [0x002BEA56]
Havi! Show us your might! Beat our champion, and we will drain our horns in your honor.

Id: [0x002BEA67]
This assumes they will be sober after a week of drinking and weeping.

Id: [0x002BEA72]
I suppose we should get started. Our guests need looking after.

Id: [0x002BEA76]
You are a true gift, Eivor. Thank you.

Id: [0x002BEA78]
Trygve is Hemthorpe's rock. With him around, the city can keep its peace.

Id: [0x002BEA7B]
[laugh]It was something I had hoped to give him in life. You must see it to believe it.

Id: [0x002BEA7D]
There's a heaviness to your look, Eivor. What troubles you?

Id: [0x002BEA7F]
That would be Vili, would it not?

Id: [0x002BEA83]
I will look for you later, to save you from them once the mead has really soaked in.

Id: [0x002BEA84]
I will look for you later, to save you from them once the mead has really soaked in.

Id: [0x002BEA87]
When did you have time to make a funeral gift?

Id: [0x002BEA88]

Id: [0x002BEA89]
Hemming desired my counsel before he died. Wanted my opinion on the future of this clan's leadership.

Id: [0x002BEA8A]
Hemming desired my counsel before he died. Wanted my opinion on the future of this clan's leadership.

Id: [0x002BEA8B]
It is a good idea. But let me go alone.

Id: [0x002BEA8C]
It is a good idea. But let me go alone.

Id: [0x002BEA93]
Havi! Why are you here?

Id: [0x002BEA94]
Havi! I heard a noise, and I … What are you doing here?

Id: [0x002BEA98]
You are a thief and an agent of chaos. I'll see you pay for this deceit. Guards!

Id: [0x002BEA9A]
I have come for the Mead, and neither you nor your father will keep me from it.

Id: [0x002BEA9B]
I have come for the Mead, and neither you nor your father will keep me from it.

Id: [0x002BEAA1]
You and I? How? It makes no sense.

Id: [0x002BEAA5]
Fate, Gunlodr. We are helpless to escape it. And we were fated to be here now, together.

Id: [0x002BEAA6]
Fate, Gunlodr. We are helpless to escape it. And we were fated to be here now, together.

Id: [0x002BEAA7]
The Nornir spin their patterns, and we can only surrender. We are entwined, spun together. There is perfect sense in that.

Id: [0x002BEAA8]
The Nornir spin their patterns, and we can only surrender. We are entwined, spun together. There is perfect sense in that.

Id: [0x002BEAAF]
No. You tease and mock, but I do not believe your lies. Your only desire is the Mead!

Id: [0x002BEAB6]
I wanted to speak with you, away from the others. I brought you something. A gift.

Id: [0x002BEAB7]
I wanted to speak with you, away from the others. I brought you something. A gift.

Id: [0x002BEAB9]
For me? Thank you, but … why?

Id: [0x002BEABB]
Your words, your gift, your eyes when you look upon me. You bewilder me, Havi. I do not understand you.

Id: [0x002BEAC1]
Listen and attend. I'll show all you need to know.

Id: [0x002BEAC2]
Listen and attend. I will show all you need to know.

Id: [0x002BEAC6]
Shame. Wanted to see the look on Burgred's face when we stormed his fortress. Now we'll just hear big tales, told by drunken heroes.

Id: [0x002BEACC]
If I do, I'll stoke that flame until it burns.

Id: [0x002BEACE]
Rats don't appreciate gifts. They sniff and lick them, without care.

Id: [0x002BEAD0]
Or it may be you will light a fire beneath him. Inspire him with tales of our glory.

Id: [0x002BEAD1]

You are chipper, Brother.

Id: [0x002BEAD5]
You are chipper, Brother.

Id: [0x002BEAD6]
Let me guess, you're lost?

Id: [0x002BEAE5]
If you wish to have words, come closer.

Id: [0x002BEB10]
Leave me to sort through the wreckage. Ulkerthorpe is up that way.

Id: [0x002BEB2B]
The survivors ran into the fog, pursued by half the party, while the other bandits looted it.

Id: [0x002BEB2C]
The survivors ran into the fog, pursued by half the party, while the other bandits looted it.

Id: [0x002BEB35]
Slap some moss on that gash and wrap it well.

Id: [0x002BEB38]
I have, but this does not sit well with me, Eivor. This is a Christian feast, and the people here are not soldiers.

Id: [0x002BEB3A]
Deorlaf. You have come again at my call.

Id: [0x002BEB3B]
Deorlaf. You have come again at my call.

Id: [0x002BEB3C]
Right. Talkers they are, Ubba and Sigurd. Might want to dig the wax from your ears.

Id: [0x002BEB41]
(moaning)

Id: [0x002BEB42]
Hold his arms.

Id: [0x002BEB51]
I have chosen my side. I would sooner bed a hog than allow Aelfred to pillage the land I love.

Id: [0x002BEB54]
Geadric. After Rouecistre I was not sure you would come again.

Id: [0x002BEB55]
Geadric. After Rouecistre I was not sure you would come again.

Id: [0x002BEB61]
When is their feast day?

Id: [0x002BEB62]
When is their feast day?

Id: [0x002BEB7B]
Did you think my king would turn his back on you, Eivor? When your knife is smeared with the blood of Werham?

Id: [0x002BEB7D]
Aelfred is long gone. And this good Christian feast, a cup of honey-wine to trap some wasps.

Id: [0x002BEB81]
Aelfred! Face me and I will spare the last of Wessex from my torch.

Id: [0x002BEB82]
Aelfred! Face me and I will spare the last of Wessex my torch.

Id: [0x002BEB83]
Stand aside, Goodwin. I come for Aelfred.

Id: [0x002BEB84]
Stand aside, Goodwin. I come for Aelfred.

Id: [0x002BEB85]
Where is he?

Id: [0x002BEB86]
Where is he?

Id: [0x002BEB9D]
Perhaps not, Eivor. It may be I will sit beside my father soon. Will he be proud of me?

Id: [0x002BEB9F]
Hunwald, listen to me. You survived the battle of Botolphston. Do not let this scratch best you now.

Id: [0x002BEBA0]
Hunwald, listen to me. You survived the battle of Botolphston. Do not let this scratch best you now.

He will pull you to his breast, sob bright words of welcome … and tell you no man ever had a worthier son.

You must be Soma.

Id: [0x002BEC20]
You must be Soma.

Id: [0x002BEC27]
A cowardly act, one I abhor. Dag acted out of love for this clan. That is not worth the shame you inflicted on his name.

Id: [0x002BEC2D]
And I want what's best for my son. In Burgred's Mercia, where Danes and Saxons murder one another daily, it's not possible.

Id: [0x002BEC61]
Modron! Stay your blade, or die at my hand.

Id: [0x002BEC62]
Modron! Stay your blade, or die at my hand.

Id: [0x002BECBC]
Burdened by grief … drowning in mead.

Id: [0x002BECD7]
Be fair. Be just. And call upon us often, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002BECD8]
Be fair. Be just. And call upon us often, Arse-Stick.

Id: [0x002BECD9]
Eivor, yes. A long stroll through the hills and fields of Mercia. All so I could thank you.

Id: [0x002BECDB]
He is. And as a show of thanks, I came to offer you a gift. A token of my respect.

Id: [0x002BECDC]
Do not make pleasant with me, Wolf-Kissed. I know what you did. Did you think you could keep it a secret forever?

Id: [0x002BECDE]
Speak no more, Eivor. Lies are all you know. I want this settled. One on one, fist to fist. Come!

Id: [0x002BECDF]
A darkness followed your brother, one I am not sure he understood. But as you say, he is now where he belongs.

Id: [0x002BECE0]
A darkness followed your brother, one I am not sure he understood. But as you say, he's now where he belongs.

You know what he did, Ubba. The oaths he broke, the lies he spread.

Id: [0x002BECE2]
You know what he did, Ubba. The oaths he broke, the lies he spread.

Id: [0x002BECE8]
It will take time and resources to build ourselves a new home. But the riches taken from Kjotve's raid would suffice.

Id: [0x002BECEE]
Keep your eye on this one. He'll be worth a hefty bounty.

Id: [0x002BECEF]
Keep your eye on this one. He'll be worth a hefty bounty.

We have your man. Now let's finish this shadow play and be gone.

We have your man. Now let's finish this shadow play and be gone.

Id: [0x002BECF2]
I should have known Cynon wouldn't have it in him to quarter you for the dogs.

You understand so little. No matter. Let me enlighten you with the fury of the gods.

Go!

Id: [0x002BED64]
Go!

Id: [0x002BED77]
An impressive shield!

Id: [0x002BED7A]
I would take you there myself, but I have Isbjorn to retrieve.

Id: [0x002BED7C]
He lost it some winters back on a bear hunt. He hit the beast hard, but the spear stuck and the bear fled into the forest.

Id: [0x002BED7F]

I know a man. A master craftsman in exile. He lives in a cave northeast of Hemthorpe.

A sigil, I think. A mark to adorn the front. We need an artisan. Is there one in the village?

You were warned, farmer.

Vili has no say. Fate has already decided.

We both know that's not true.

I have heard Mercia is more temperate. Dense forests, bright colors, thriving streams. Is that how it is in your settlement?

Id: [0x002BEF09]
Finding Sigurd rests in the success of this plot for Cynebert.

Id: [0x002BEF0B]
And knock Wessex down a peg or two.

Because my husband has the courage of a quivering dormouse. All I ask for is a child.

Id: [0x002BEF50]
Every woman I know who has gone to the rock has left with child. It's a miracle.

Randvi.

Id: [0x002BEFCF]
And it's bloody cold. Colder than I remember.

Id: [0x002BEFDD]
Then Lady Eadwyn's soldiers swept in. A fight broke out. Your brother and the tanned fella got away.

Id: [0x002BEFE8]
You wield the blade well.

Id: [0x002BEFF1]
Eivor. Let us walk to the docks and take in the night air.

Id: [0x002BEFFB]
And the faces of our gods, all of whom called me friend, brother, warrior. I felt at home among them. Warmed by their love.

Id: [0x002BF001]
You will see soon enough.

Id: [0x002BF003]
There! The cave! Within hides the sacred gate.

And too late to turn back, I fear.

No, it's even better! You cannot imagine what discoveries await.

I hope I will.

I hope I will.

We'll be safe here.

Olav. Poor Olav … he'll be buried with honors, I'll see to that.

My scout. He asked me to join him here, but he's nowhere to be found. Have a look around, tell me if you see something.

Look here, they ate rats for supper. Explains why they fought like vermin.

Id: [0x002BF068]
[sigh]Thought I would find at least one of those fools squirreled away somewhere.

Id: [0x002BF069]
All scraps and rubbish over here. What a mess.

Id: [0x002BF06A]
Foul food for foul fighters.

Id: [0x002BF06B]
I think this is clear. What do you say, darling?

Id: [0x002BF06C]
Keep an eye on the roads running from camp. An ambush could come from anywhere.

Id: [0x002BF06D]
Nothing to see here. All good!

Id: [0x002BF06E]
These folks know nothing of tending to their weapons. Careless fools.

I'd wager they hid in one of the fish houses there.

Id: [0x002BF0CA]
It's a good bet they hid in one of them fish houses.

Id: [0x002BF0CF]
A good find, Eivor. Let's have a word.

Sigurd, these men were keeping prisoners. I found two in the longhouse.

Right. I will check the longhouse.

Right. I will check the longhouse.

Eivor … look at this

Id: [0x002BF0D9]
The other boats will be here soon. We should check on these prisoners.

A noise trap. Might be something inside. I will have a look.

That's it! Eivor raised the portcullis! Come men, surge on, surge on.

Id: [0x002BF38C]
Our way is open, rally to the inner keep.

Nothing is standing in our way, their defenses have fallen.

Scared of an old hag? Well, come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002BF3D6]
This challenge is beneath me. I will not dance for your amusement.

Id: [0x002BF3D7]
This challenge is beneath me. I will not dance for your amusement.

Found your courage, have you? Are you ready to face our champion now?

Id: [0x002BF3DC]
I'm back.

I'm back.

From what I heard, Tonna has a hunger for two things, soft silver and a stern hump. Neither of which earns you true loyalty.

Id: [0x002BF409]
This will not be easy, Tedmund has fortified his hiding hole well.

Id: [0x002BF432]
Aesir blood will infuse this water, and the poor humans of Midgard will be forever altered. What happens then, none can say.

My hugr is here. That is all that matters. I have learned to live incomplete, as will you.

You yourself have lost much for wisdom, beheaded by those who did not value your learning.

Id: [0x002BF439]
You yourself have lost much for wisdom, beheaded by those who did not value your learning.

Id: [0x002BF43A]
This is what the others feared. But then they always cared overmuch for vermin.

Id: [0x002BF440]
Your voice, Eivor. You sound different than the brothers.

Id: [0x002BF443]
You who seek immortality may find it within these waters. But there is a price.

Id: [0x002BF447]
Good ear, lord. Most in England cannot tell the difference. But not all Danes are Danes.

Id: [0x002BF448]
Good ear, lord. Most in England cannot tell the difference. But not all Danes are Danes.

Id: [0x002BF46C]
Please, my love, you must forgive me. I cannot sleep, I cannot eat.

Id: [0x002BF473]
No, no! What have you done? Her sobs, her screams. I can no longer hear her call to me!

Id: [0x002BF479]
Long live Geadric!

Id: [0x002BF47A]
None will stop us!

Id: [0x002BF47B]
Eivor, Geadric and victory!

Id: [0x002BF47D]
That's Burgred's war-thegn. Killed a dozen of our men in an ambush along the river Trent. It was Ivarr's axe that stopped him.

Id: [0x002BF47E]
That is a poor description of a perfect thirty-yard toss.

Id: [0x002BF482]
A cauldron. How did something so large end up in here?

A cauldron. How did something so large end up in here?

Id: [0x002BF484]
Eivor, tell the captain we're ready to march. Ivarr and I will round up the men. Do you know your way around a battering ram?

Id: [0x002BF48D]
When the march begins, find an empty tent and stay there.

Id: [0x002BF492]
Do not think me a coward. I am not afraid of war. I do not want to kill my friends.

Id: [0x002BF495]
I know these men, Eivor. I've supped with them. Not two weeks ago, Leofrith showed me how to wield a greatsword. He's a friend.

Id: [0x002BF496]
Ceolbert … something wrong?

Id: [0x002BF497]
Ceolbert … something wrong?

Id: [0x002BF498]
Friendships end. Often at the point of a spear.

Id: [0x002BF49B]
It cannot be that cold. Least of all with Leofrith. He is only following orders.

Id: [0x002BF4CB]
I have given you all I care to, a Danegeld to leave Werham. You swore an oath upon the cross and that pagan hammer.

Id: [0x002BF4CC]
And when you scurry back to whatever shit-soaked hovel you crawled from, we will release your men.

Id: [0x002BF4CD]
Speak again, handmaid, and I will feed your tongue to Eivor's raven.

Id: [0x002BF4D0]
You have one day. Do not test the king's patience further, or our men will return to Werham with force.

Id: [0x002BF517]
It's open!

Id: [0x002BF519]
Take the castle!

Id: [0x002BF51A]
Take the castle!

Id: [0x002BF51C]
Pour through, men!

Id: [0x002BF51F]
Agreed. All clear.

Lady Eadwyn!

Id: [0x002BF527]
Lady Eadwyn!

Id: [0x002BF52A]
Eivor! You rigged the defenses!

Id: [0x002BF52B]
Overwhelm them!

Id: [0x002BF531]
Friend or foe?

Id: [0x002BF544]
(panting)

Id: [0x002BF546]
Would you have denied me my reward, Eivor? Had it come to it?

Id: [0x002BF548]
There is no shame in it. Go … and mourn as you must.

Id: [0x002BF549]
There is no shame in it. Go … and mourn as you must.

Id: [0x002BF54A]
Never.

Id: [0x002BF54B]
Never.

Id: [0x002BF54D]
You had best hope our paths do not cross while I yet mourn, lest kindness fail me.

Id: [0x002BF54E]
You were not there. You did not see the evil in your brother's eyes. Ivarr earned what he got.

Id: [0x002BF54F]
You were not there. You did not see the evil in your brother's eyes. Ivarr earned what he got.

Id: [0x002BF551]
For sending my brother to his just reward, in spite of the harm he caused you and everyone around you.

Id: [0x002BF552]
Thank me?

Id: [0x002BF553]
Thank me?

Id: [0x002BF554]
He was my brother! And a king!

Id: [0x002BF556]
All this I know. But I do not regret what I did.

Id: [0x002BF557]
All this I know. But I do not regret what I did.

Sigurd, what is all this? Your arm has returned … and your vigor as well.

Id: [0x002BF57B]
Fight me!

Id: [0x002BF57C]
Now the real dance, here! Come fight me!

Id: [0x002BF57E]
And hold nothing back. For here we need not fear a thing.

Id: [0x002BF580]
You will taste a meal of iron before the day is out!

Id: [0x002BF587]
Take your horn. Join the battle cheer.

Id: [0x002BF588]
Dearest skald of war and verse, how do you like this frenzy so far?

Id: [0x002BF58A]
It is … it is quite something.

Id: [0x002BF58B]
It is … it is quite something.

Id: [0x002BF5A1]
Eivor, enjoy this! Your father has returned.

Id: [0x002BF5A4]
We fought, Father. But you did not. You died a coward.

Id: [0x002BF5A5]
We fought, Father. But you did not. You died a coward.

It's open!

It's open!

Id: [0x002BF5AB]
Have you lost all your love for life?

Id: [0x002BF5AC]
Have you spoke with Hytham about Vinland?

Id: [0x002BF5AE]
Good. I have marked it on the map, with a bit of guess work as to its location. Let me know when you wish to leave.

Id: [0x002BF5AF]
O, and there is something else…

Id: [0x002BF5B1]
I have.

Id: [0x002BF5B2]
I have.

Id: [0x002BF5B3]
Was there something else?

Id: [0x002BF5B4]
Was there something else?

Id: [0x002BF5C6]
Do not despair, Eivor. Look. Your friends are here. Everyone you could ever want is here beside you.

Id: [0x002BF5C8]
Illusion or not, here there is no death, no pain, no loss…

Id: [0x002BF5C9]
No, that cannot be true. None of this feels right.

Id: [0x002BF5CA]
No, that cannot be true. None of this feels right.

Id: [0x002BF5CB]
The ecstasy I feel here is an illusion. I'd sooner caw like a Raven than sing a false song.

Id: [0x002BF5CC]
The ecstasy I feel here … is an illusion. I'd sooner caw like a raven than sing a false song.

Id: [0x002BF5CD]
I have returned for one reason only. To say goodbye. And to thank you … for your colossal failure.

Id: [0x002BF5CF]
My son, please…

Id: [0x002BF5D5]
Find Eadwyn!

Id: [0x002BF5D6]
Find Eadwyn!

Id: [0x002BF5D8]
As Sigurd has so ordered, it falls to us to expand our presence in England.

Id: [0x002BF5D9]
Right. We are the outsiders here. Making friends will help.

Id: [0x002BF5DD]
She has bodyguards.

Id: [0x002BF5EF]
Bring down the drawbridge!

Id: [0x002BF5F1]
(howl)

Id: [0x002BF5FC]
You should have knocked first…

Id: [0x002BF5FD]
You should have knocked first…

Id: [0x002BF5FE]
Spare no one!

Id: [0x002BF5FF]
Ah, there you are.

Id: [0x002BF600]
Eivor, I have something to show you.

Id: [0x002BF601]
Do you have a moment?

Id: [0x002BF606]
Yeah--

Id: [0x002BF607]
You'll be chasing more in a month, my friend.

Id: [0x002BF609]
She's through there!

Id: [0x002BF60B]
You remember our great battle? You remember how we fought, side by side, with your mother and Sigurd and our clans united?

Id: [0x002BF60C]
How did you find your way here?

Id: [0x002BF60D]
How did you find your way here?

Id: [0x002BF60F]
Eivor! Get to the portcullis!

Id: [0x002BF61C]
There's your wages.

Id: [0x002BF61D]
There's your wages.

Id: [0x002BF61E]
Go to your god, wherever he hides.

Id: [0x002BF61F]
Go to your god, wherever he hides.

Id: [0x002BF625]
I wish you well, Svala. But this is not for me.

Id: [0x002BF626]
I wish you well, Svala. But this is not for me.

Id: [0x002BF62F]
I see. Thank you for telling me.

Id: [0x002BF631]
Take care, will you?

Id: [0x002BF632]
Take care, will you?

Id: [0x002BF636]
And here's Eivor.

Id: [0x002BF642]
This is not special treatment. I want you here in the longhouse, close at hand.

Id: [0x002BF645]
It suits me well.

Id: [0x002BF646]
It suits me well.

Id: [0x002BF64B]
But I would be just as happy lodging with the raiders on the wharf. I need no special treatment.

The cauldron is empty. I should tell Suttungr.

Id: [0x002BF6F1]
The cauldron is empty. I should tell Suttungr.

Id: [0x002BF6F3]
Father?

Id: [0x002BF6F4]
Open the vault. Instruct the thralls to bring more mead for my guests!

Id: [0x002BF6F6]
Great Suttungr, your guests thirst for mead yet the cauldron is dry.

Id: [0x002BF6F7]
Great Suttungr, your guests thirst for mead yet the cauldron is dry.

Id: [0x002BF6F8]
Do they really need more, Father? Several are unconscious already.

Id: [0x002BF6F9]
Do as I ask, Daughter. Give them all they can drink.

Id: [0x002BF6FA]
As you wish. I will open the vault.

Id: [0x002BF702]
It was never mine by right. Thor won it from Hymir so he might feast in my hall. I only kept it on his behalf.

Id: [0x002BF703]
And after that bloody business with Hymir's sons, well, I'd as soon be rid of it! I'll have no strife beneath my roof.

Id: [0x002BF704]
Aegir, mighty friend to the Aesir! Are you not sorry to lose your cauldron?

Id: [0x002BF705]
Aegir, mighty friend to the Aesir! Are you not sorry to lose your cauldron?

Id: [0x002BF707]
And I'll drink to anything!

Id: [0x002BF709]
The end of strife. I'll drink to that!

Id: [0x002BF70A]
The end of strife. I'll drink to that!

No hand turned it, nor hammer beat it. But there, outside the islands, the upright one who made it.

Id: [0x002BF71E]
Thor's bridal circlet. No sense leaving it to tarnish down here.

Id: [0x002BF71F]

Id: [0x002BF720]
You wanted to see me?

You wanted to see me?

Id: [0x002BF726]
Deceiver! False-tongue! Dishonorable trickster!

Id: [0x002BF727]
You would gamble with uncountable lives!

Id: [0x002BF728]
What have you done with my daughter?

Id: [0x002BF729]
I have lived too long to suffer one such as you!

Id: [0x002BF72A]
I will take that Mead from your dead hands, thief!

Id: [0x002BF749]
Ceolbert will be remembered. He was good company, in the short time he was with us.

Id: [0x002BF74B]
Justice was done.

Justice was done.

Id: [0x002BF74D]
He was.

No, but he should be. By trial or by training.

Id: [0x002BF7A5]
Eivor … a word if you would.

Id: [0x002BF7B0]
Ah! You mean to go a-viking, then! Good, good.

Id: [0x002BF7B3]
Sigurd wants your forge up and running as soon as possible. For that we need supplies and riches.

If death were bearing down upon us, I worry neither would have what it takes to carry us through.

Fight upon my command!

What would you do if you were the Jarl of Grantebridge?

Id: [0x002BF7D6]
What would you do if you were the Jarl of Grantebridge?

Id: [0x002BF7D8]
Dig, Eivor. Into the wellspring of your memory!

Id: [0x002BF7DA]
We shared so much in England. Fought and bled together.

Id: [0x002BF7E1]
I have waited countless ages for this moment. No more talk! I hunger for this kill.

Id: [0x002BF7E6]
[laugh]The kiss of a wolf takes my prize! Of course!

Id: [0x002BF818]
Ha! Lets drink!

Id: [0x002BF819]
You look like a game horn swiller, what say you?

Id: [0x002BF81B]
Bit of a miser, huh?

Id: [0x002BF81E]
Ha, too poor? Stick to goat's milk then!

Id: [0x002BF877]
Yes, you missed me. Once or twice, I hear.

Id: [0x002BF878]
Sigurd Jarl. Back where you belong.

Id: [0x002BF879]
Sigurd Jarl. Back where you belong.

Id: [0x002BF87A]
A fair wager.

For gold and glory! Lets drink!

A lively town. Quite a lot to see here.

Come, join me for a game of Orlog!

Id: [0x002BF88E]
Fortune favors the bold! Are you brave enough for a game or two?

Id: [0x002BF88F]
Very good ...

Id: [0x002BF890]
No, no, no!

Id: [0x002BF891]
Oof! You are pretty good! Shall we go again?

Id: [0x002BF892]
[laughing]I like you already!

Id: [0x002BF893]
Aw, are you going to run away now? Surely not, another round perhaps?

Id: [0x002BF894]
Ah, most disappointing.

Id: [0x002BF899]
Because he is my brother. I love him. And I will do what it takes to drag him back around to my way of thinking.

Id: [0x002BF89C]
If it bothers you so much, why not strike out on your own?

Id: [0x002BF89D]
If it bothers you so much, why not strike out on your own?

Id: [0x002BF8A1]
Like me. Ferocious. Wild.

Id: [0x002BF8A3]
If that is a compliment, I missed it. All I mean to say is, things were easier some time ago.

Id: [0x002BF8A4]
What was he like before?

Id: [0x002BF8A5]
What was he like before?

With respect, I don't think anyone is like you.

Peace, peace, peace! Not with this bag of Briton slop.

On that we are agreed.

Id: [0x002BF8B9]
This Dane is deluded! How dare you speak to my husband in this manner.

Id: [0x002BF8BC]
Go to your homes. I will lay him to rest.

Go to your homes. I will lay him to rest.

Don't worry, all pets come fully trained and mostly housebroken.

Id: [0x002BF8C0]
Ah, the joys of a flying friend. Enjoy.

Id: [0x002BF8C5]
Help us, please! We're stuck, and my brother is sickly. The smoke is too much!

Id: [0x002BF8C9]
Eivor, well met! You received my message, and just in time. Our negotiations with the Britons have not yet begun.

Id: [0x002BF8CF]
It may be you should stay behind, Ivarr. That is not a recipe for a good parlay.

Id: [0x002BF8D0]
It may be you should stay behind, Ivarr. That's not a recipe for a good parlay.

Id: [0x002BF8EC]
Please hurry, he cannot breathe!

Id: [0x002BF8F1]
Stay with me! We'll get you out.

Bah, I've seen roosters fight with more spirit.

Id: [0x002BF8FE]
Oddly enough, so have I.

Hjorr and Ljufvina settled near this harbor. Someone should know where to find them.

Ljufvina!

Id: [0x002BF924]
Ljufvina!

Id: [0x002BF925]
All this. We conquered this. He and I. Together.

Id: [0x002BF93F]
Breathe, Ljufvina. You are rattled. You know me. I am a friend.

This cave is a passage. The Picts are using it to cross the mountain.

I haven't heard anything from her for over a year.

Id: [0x002BF9AE]
Okay. I'll pack the van.

Id: [0x002BF9E3]
Through the digital lattice that enwebs this earth like a spider's nest.

Id: [0x002BFA0B]
Have you spoken with Randvi? Are we ready to leave?

Id: [0x002BFA0E]
I will. Have patience.

Id: [0x002BFA0F]
I will. Have patience.

Id: [0x002BFA15]
That man's anger. His rage. It had a familiar sting that I … I cannot place.

Id: [0x002BFA17]
I am not mad, Eivor. These things I see and feel … I know they are true.

Id: [0x002BFA18]
He was raving, Sigurd. Without sense or reason. Pay it no mind.

I cannot return to England with you. That is not my home … not now.

Id: [0x002BFA23]
What are you saying?

Id: [0x002BFA24]
What are you saying?

Id: [0x002BFA25]
I am not the man I was. My time as the jarl of our clan has run short. You must lead us now.

Id: [0x002BFA27]
Do you mean this?

Id: [0x002BFA28]
Do you mean this?

Id: [0x002BFA2C]
Burn Werham to the ground, make it a Saxon pyre!

Burn Werham to the ground, make it a Saxon pyre!

Id: [0x002BFA3E]
I'm as regular as tidewater.

Id: [0x002BFA3F]
I shall go with you. If only to get an honest accounting of our situation.

Id: [0x002BFA40]
Risk averse?

Id: [0x002BFA41]
I think that was the solution to our problem.

Id: [0x002BFA44]
Breach another cask!

Id: [0x002BFA45]
Shall we drink the place dry, friend?

Id: [0x002BFA47]
That's worth my while.

Id: [0x002BFA48]
No fear! Ha! Me neither!

Id: [0x002BFA4B]
Fair enough... I wouldn't take me on either!

Id: [0x002BFA4E]
Shall we, then, Eivor? To Norway … and well beyond.

Id: [0x002BFA50]
Please, Eivor. Be quick.

Id: [0x002BFA52]
I have a few things to take care of.

Id: [0x002BFA53]

To Norway, then.

Id: [0x002BFA55]
To Norway, then.

Id: [0x002BFA5A]
I hear you.

Id: [0x002BFA5E]
Millions upon millions of possible roads.

Id: [0x002BFA63]
Peace with Rhodri is as likely as you dying a virgin, bishop. It won't happen. He is too canny, too vile.

Id: [0x002BFA65]
Remember, you don't need to kill him. Have fun. I'll be planning our next move in the longhouse.

Id: [0x002BFA6D]
It's time to take the fight to these … these Templars, as you call them.

Id: [0x002BFA72]
It's a nice place to die, Eivor. Not everyone gets to choose.

Id: [0x002BFA79]
Speak your grievance!

Id: [0x002BFA7C]
Show yourself!

Id: [0x002BFA83]
What does battle serve?

Id: [0x002BFA8E]
If you are resigned to this, so be it.

Id: [0x002BFA8F]
If you are resigned to this, so be it.

Id: [0x002BFA97]
This was not a battle we needed, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002BFA9E]
Be on your guard, Sigurd!

Id: [0x002BFA9F]
Be on your guard, Sigurd!

Id: [0x002BFAA0]
Fight me here!

Id: [0x002BFAB5]
Can't risk them seeing us, and Burgred slipping away again. You stay here and wait for your scout. I'm going in.

Id: [0x002BFAB6]

How can you be sure?

Id: [0x002BFABA]
Leofrith passed this way with some men. I eavesdropped. It seems they're only stockpiling food here.

Id: [0x002BFAD4]
Oath-breaker! You'll die here!

Id: [0x002BFAD5]
This brings me no joy, Justice-Bringer. You were always so kind, but you chose the wrong side.

Id: [0x002BFAD9]
I am your prize, Basim. Come.

Id: [0x002BFADA]
I am your prize, Basim. Come.

Id: [0x002BFADB]
Give him a chance.

Id: [0x002BFAE0]
He's worse off than I am.

Id: [0x002BFAE1]
He's worse off than I am.

Id: [0x002BFAE2]
How much did we drink? I don't remember this at all.

Id: [0x002BFAE3]
How much did we drink? I don't remember this at all.

Id: [0x002BFAE8]
Will you not die?

Id: [0x002BFAEA]
Not here. Not by your hand.

Id: [0x002BFAEB]
Not here. Not by your hand.

Id: [0x002BFAF3]
You have something you want to say? Then say it.

Id: [0x002BFAF4]
You have something you want to say? Then say it.

Id: [0x002BFB05]
With Ivarr gone, peace and quiet are now possible. That is something.

Id: [0x002BFB0B]
I know your type, Wolf-Kissed. But me, I am not looking as far into the future as you.

Id: [0x002BFB16]
Wind across the water, the battle maidens beat their wings to carry a king to Odin's hall of corpses.

Id: [0x002BFB35]
You're wasting your time. I won't talk. Not to you, not to any of you barbarians.

Id: [0x002BFB37]
You don't frighten me.

Id: [0x002BFB39]
You may reconsider, if only for your people. For who knows how many more might die at the hands of us barbarians?

Id: [0x002BFB3A]
You may reconsider, if only for your people. For who knows how many more might die at the hands of us barbarians?

The fight is mine, Kjotve. Sigurd is only here to watch me feed your innards to my raven.

I'm at your side, Soma

Id: [0x002BFB4C]
Eivor, the honor is yours.

Id: [0x002BFB9C]
A trail of yellow paint drops…

Id: [0x002BFB9D]
A trail of yellow paint drops…

Id: [0x002BFB9E]
Drink, Holger. And save your poems for your king.

Id: [0x002BFBA0]
Is it true? Is he descended from the Archons' children, the Isu?

Id: [0x002BFBA1]
The bleeding effect shouldn't take long to kick in. A few days at most. So here we go…

Id: [0x002BFBA4]
All I had.

Id: [0x002BFBA5]
There's Hjorr.

Id: [0x002BFBA6]
Eivor! We heard you and Sigurd had settled in England!

Id: [0x002BFBBF]
You're a blight on this world! The whole lot of you. A rancid disease!

Id: [0x002BFBD4]
Understood, dear Faravid, but we also have a responsibility to our townspeople. The Yuletide must go on.

Id: [0x002BFBD5]
The Picts are winning this war. We should be scraping together every ounce of silver to procure food for our men!

Id: [0x002BFBE2]
It went well enough. Ricsige will stay out of my way. No one can argue, the Red Hand must be dealt with.

Id: [0x002BFBE3]
It went well enough. Ricsige will stay out of my way. No one can argue, the Red Hand must be dealt with.

Id: [0x002BFBEA]
You don't deserve Mercia.

Id: [0x002BFC15]
Eyes open for the coward, King Ricsige.

Id: [0x002BFC16]
Eyes open for the coward, King Ricsige.

Id: [0x002BFC17]
Charge! And may the skalds remember us!

Id: [0x002BFC1A]
Press on!

Id: [0x002BFC1D]
Let the Picts remember this in their Hell.

Id: [0x002BFC23]
I'll have your head, Ricsige!

Id: [0x002BFC26]
This is the last of them!

Id: [0x002BFC29]
Thor sends more Pict skulls to my hammer.

Id: [0x002BFC2C]
Careful. They mean to burn us!

Id: [0x002BFC36]
(scream)

Id: [0x002BFC3A]
Pfft. We're not moving, heathen. We're watching you!

Id: [0x002BFC66]
I would, gladly. And often do, from time to time. To ensure it's not overly bitter before serving to Halfdan.

Id: [0x002BFC67]
And if I asked you to drink your own brew?

Id: [0x002BFC68]
And if I asked you to drink your own brew?

Id: [0x002BFC6F]
Tread lightly this topic with him. If you would tread it at all.

Id: [0x002BFCA2]
They forced my hand.

Id: [0x002BFCAA]
Faravid killed this man, not me! He forced my hand with slights and trickery! He--

Id: [0x002BFCAC]
(coughing)

Id: [0x002BFCAD]
Forgive me, I … I find it hot in these furs. The day must be warming.

Id: [0x002BFCB0]
You have a meeting with Faravid. Isn't that right?

Id: [0x002BFCB2]
Take hold of your fear, Halfdan. It can poison your mind.

Id: [0x002BFCB3]
Take hold of your fear, Halfdan. It can poison your mind.

Id: [0x002BFCB6]
Yes, I know the place well. It's on the road between Jorvik and Picheringa.

Id: [0x002BFCB7]
I do. At the Wolds.

Id: [0x002BFCB8]
I do. At the Wolds.

Id: [0x002BFCBB]
Hmph. I see. Say nothing of what you told me. He must not know that I am aware of his plan.

Id: [0x002BFCBC]
His forces are gathering at Stenwege. It's from there he plans to attack the Picts at Magnis.

Id: [0x002BFCBD]
His forces are gathering at Stenwege. It's from there he plans to attack the Picts at Magnis.

I'll take my leave, lord.

Id: [0x002BFCC0]
I'll take my leave, lord.

Id: [0x002BFCC1]
Press him, Eivor. As hard as you can! Never let up! And bring me proof of his treachery … or otherwise.

Id: [0x002BFCCE]
It pleases me to see you, old friend. All are welcome here in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002BFD23]
Not me! My wife. Save her first!

Id: [0x002BFD2A]
O, my dear Hilda … why! I cannot live without you! I cannot bear to go on.

Id: [0x002BFD3D]
Our victory is for Halfdan's own benefit. We will secure Northumbria for him, along with the gratitude of all its Saxon and Norse subjects.

Id: [0x002BFD41]
Right then, what's this?

Id: [0x002BFD5C]
All this silverware … some still in their crates. Has this all been seized as well?

Id: [0x002BFD5D]
All this silverware … some still in their crates. Has this all been seized as well?

Id: [0x002BFD93]
Who else knows the chosen man?

Id: [0x002BFD94]
Who else knows the chosen man?

Id: [0x002BFD95]
Then I will find you there when the ealdorman's name is mine.

Id: [0x002BFD96]
Then I will find you there when the ealdorman's name is mine.

Id: [0x002BFD97]
You have drawn a dark conclusion about me, haven't you? That is all well and good. I've drawn some about you as well.

Id: [0x002BFD99]
See what I mean? Dark. Too dark.

Id: [0x002BFD9A]
Are you leading a lamb to slaughter?

Id: [0x002BFD9B]
Are you leading a lamb to slaughter?

Id: [0x002BFD9D]
And where in God's great Heaven am I? It will take me days to get back to Tonbridge!

Id: [0x002BFD9E]
Sigurd would not let you ride on the big boat, huh?

Id: [0x002BFDA0]
He wanted someone to keep you on a leash.

Id: [0x002BFDA1]
He wanted someone to keep you on a leash.

Id: [0x002BFDA6]
What do you think of Sigurd's foreign friends? These … shadow warriors?

Id: [0x002BFDA8]
He seems to enjoy their company.

Id: [0x002BFDAA]
Ja. I would not be surprised if he takes to the sea soon after this victory.

Id: [0x002BFDAB]
It's hard to say. Are they here to help Sigurd, or is Sigurd some help to them?

Id: [0x002BFDAC]
It is hard to say. Are they here to help Sigurd, or is Sigurd some help to them?

Id: [0x002BFDAD]
Sigurd is a curious man. Always with one eye to the horizon.

Id: [0x002BFDAE]
Sigurd is a curious man. Always with one eye to the horizon.

Id: [0x002BFDB2]
Must be nice to be a prince.

Id: [0x002BFDB4]
Not if your father is king.

Id: [0x002BFDB5]
Not if your father is king.

Id: [0x002BFDB7]
I caught only a short look at King Harald. From a distance he seemed a surly, scrawny youth. Was it him?

Id: [0x002BFDB9]
And still with his scrawny boy-beard! He must be cold on the open sea.

Id: [0x002BFDBD]
You saw well. No more than twenty-three winters, I have heard.

Id: [0x002BFDBE]
You saw well. No more than twenty-three winters, I have heard.

Id: [0x002BFDBF]
I would wager a boy like him with an army that size is not afraid of the cold.

Id: [0x002BFDC0]
I would wager a boy like him with an army that size is not afraid of the cold.

Id: [0x002BFDC1]
He died to save us, did he not? From the original sin of Adam and Eve? Yet evil persists.

Id: [0x002BFDC2]
Does a newborn babe slain by a despot have free will?

Id: [0x002BFDC3]
Yes … no, I mean … that is too simplistic.

Id: [0x002BFDC4]
Or the priest who's heart is torn from his chest by the wolf? Judas, who was predestined to betray the Nazarene?

Id: [0x002BFDC5]
Some argue Judas was used…

Id: [0x002BFDC7]
Do my ears deceive me, Brother Hortbert? You question the scriptures? Declare Judas an innocent? A preposterous blasphemy!

Id: [0x002BFDC8]
N-no, that is not what I said! Brother Cedric … am I not the most pious of His servants?

Id: [0x002BFDCA]
Rollo!

Id: [0x002BFDCB]
Rollo!

Id: [0x002BFDCE]
No, no, no, no, no, no!

Id: [0x002BFDD0]
Just a second!

Id: [0x002BFDD1]
Just a second!

Id: [0x002BFDD3]
You heard me.

Id: [0x002BFDD4]
You heard me.

Id: [0x002BFDD6]
I'm looking for someone.

Id: [0x002BFDD7]
I'm looking for someone.

Id: [0x002BFDD9]
Are you sober enough to answer me?

Id: [0x002BFDDA]
Are you sober enough to answer me?

Id: [0x002BFE4B]
There's the trial.

Id: [0x002BFE4C]
There's the trial.

Id: [0x002BFE7B]
I have sent word to the Britons. I pray King Rhodri will again be open to peace. In spite of his brother's murder.

Id: [0x002BFE7C]
I will hunt him a great boar, I think. And together we'll roast it over a fire and tell tales of war. That should please him.

Id: [0x002BFE87]
Here will be good. Let's fish for eel. Deorlaf relishes nettle soup cooked with eels fresh from the water.

Id: [0x002BFEDC]
Eivor … Eivor!

Id: [0x002BFEE2]
Ha! Bit to the marrow's bed!

Id: [0x002BFEE4]
And again it will return!

Id: [0x002BFEEA]
Again you've lost your arm.

Id: [0x002BFEEB]
Again you've lost your arm.

Id: [0x002BFEEC]
Father…

Id: [0x002BFEED]
Father…

Id: [0x002BFEF6]
No need. I will send Hytham to search the area. You can rely on him while we are away.

Id: [0x002BFEF7]
Gods, Eivor, what happened?

Id: [0x002BFF08]
A new day?

Id: [0x002BFF09]
A new day?

Id: [0x002BFF16]
Gods, this door.

Id: [0x002BFF17]
Gods, this door.

Id: [0x002BFF1E]
Enough talk of killing! I need a moment of calm.

Id: [0x002BFF1F]
You need mead.

Id: [0x002BFF20]
No, Ivarr. True calm. A walk in the woods to clear the air. Or … fishing. Would you go fishing with me?

Id: [0x002BFF21]
Fishing, uh? Looking for a warm puddle to dangle your worm in?

Id: [0x002BFF25]
Well done, Eivor. An eel!

Id: [0x002BFF2A]
Ha! They're slippery devils.

Id: [0x002BFF30]
Ah! A strange way to celebrate victory. But then again, our Christ was a fisher of souls, was he not?

Id: [0x002BFF31]
I should rather be fair and just. But I take the compliment.

Id: [0x002BFF39]
Both of us fretting over our war-hungry companions, it seems we are of the same mind.

Id: [0x002BFF3A]
A surplus of caution never did any harm. I count this as a blessing.

Id: [0x002BFF3D]
In all things, the king and I act as one. As Lady of the Britons, I have full voice to speak for my husband and our people.

Id: [0x002BFF3E]
Then we accept, honored lady, your full authority.

Id: [0x002BFF3F]
We have confined our cutthroat to his tent.

Id: [0x002BFF40]
We have confined our cutthroat to his tent.

Id: [0x002BFF43]
You are wise to leave him behind. Your husband breathes the fire of war in a land of kindling. Here we must have peace.

Id: [0x002BFF44]
You are wise to leave him behind. Your husband breathes the fire of war in a land of kindling. Here we must have peace.

Id: [0x002BFF45]
Rhodri is King of the Britons. All promises of peace must come from his mouth.

Id: [0x002BFF46]
Rhodri is King of the Britons. All promises of peace must come from his mouth.

Id: [0x002BFF4A]
Burgred can flee his kingdom, flee his people, but he cannot flee his fate. I will see to it personally.

Id: [0x002BFF4B]
I will find him, the coward king. Tomorrow or next year. And when I do, I will give him one long breath to plead his traitor's case.

Id: [0x002BFF4C]
Do not get in my way, Eivor. This is something I need to do.

Id: [0x002BFF4D]
Agreed. Yet remember this. Whatever you stand to gain here, so do we. An alliance between my clan and Mercia's crown.

Id: [0x002BFF69]
Sigurd, I would feel better if Ceolbert was away from here, until Mercia is more stable. Would you welcome him among your clan?

Id: [0x002BFF6E]
Come. We should get back.

Id: [0x002BFF6F]
Come. We should get back.

Id: [0x002BFF71]
Come on. Let's take you back.

Id: [0x002BFF72]
Come on. Let's take you back.

Id: [0x002BFF73]
You dog! Empty are your words of loyalty and oaths! I'll kill you for this.

Id: [0x002BFF74]
Though you do remind me … I found a map among the bandits' rubbish. Marked up with the locations of Saxon monk-huts.

Id: [0x002BFF75]
My lord! Intruders!

Id: [0x002BFF77]
Where are the Saxons? We need them to take that fortress.

Id: [0x002BFF78]
Where are the Saxons? We need them to take that fortress.

Id: [0x002BFFB3]

So swift! Could it be…?

If you will not raise your eyes to the light, I'll bury you in the dark.

Id: [0x002C00A0]
My cause is greater than you can comprehend.

Id: [0x002C00A1]
Look inside yourself, Eivor. Summon all the power you can!

Id: [0x002C00A2]
You meddle in matters you do not understand!

Id: [0x002C00A3]
Others will carry on my work if I fall.

Id: [0x002C00A4]
You are more like Sigurd than you know.

A pity to kill one with such … potential.

Blind of mind, blind of sight.

The light of the Monad is all I need to guide me.

What use have you for eyes if you refuse to see?

Id: [0x002C00AC]
You have power, Eivor. Maybe more than you know.

Id: [0x002C00AE]
Even when I offer the truth, you refuse it.

You will not regret this! My wily ways and quick wit will cease the need for bloodshed.

I still might kill you yet, man, if your prattling doesn't cease.

Id: [0x002C0158]
And this fool? He knows much of our plan.

Come, Brother Shergar, and perhaps today would be the time to consider a vow of silence?

Your blacksmith is busy. Come back later.

You'll wonder where I am. You might wonder IF I am. I don't know how to answer that. But I'm not afraid. And I'm not alone.

We have work to do. Work that may take us days or years. It's impossible to say. But we'll finish it.

What I mean is … don't come looking for me. It's too dangerous and … and too late.

Bullshit.

You trying to catch flies, or would you ask something of me?

This is no mistake. This is a voluntary sacrifice to prove our devotion to--

A good start, Eivor. But you must learn how to use it effectively.

I have no wish to hide this. And I would rather not make the same mistake you two have.

Ah, now, you know that as well as I. But the rest of Cent, do not.

Cynebert held the law of God above the law of man, and he died for it. I will make the king my ally. And I have much to do!

Someone will step up, take the reins. And it will be as it ever is. They will lead, and we will follow.

Id: [0x002C03BC]
You have the curiosity of day-dead flounder.

Id: [0x002C03BF]
He will be good for Cent although … does he seem different to you? I saw him at the lumber mill, and he was changed.

Id: [0x002C03C0]
Changed how?

Id: [0x002C03C1]
Shorter, fatter, more jolly and kind. I remember him as a severe master.

Id: [0x002C03C2]
If he is a better man, I care not if his belt needs another notch to go round his waist.

Id: [0x002C03C3]
I will endeavor to do my best. And I owe this second chance to you. You did not need to trust me.

Id: [0x002C054C]
I haven't. But we caught sight of Leofrith fleeing west. Tail between his legs, across the river.

Id: [0x002C054D]
Have you seen Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002C054E]
Have you seen Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002C054F]
We can only pray.

Id: [0x002C0552]
Meaning?

Id: [0x002C0556]
Leofrith wouldn't flee. He's too proud.

Id: [0x002C0557]
Leofrith wouldn't flee. He's too proud.

Id: [0x002C0558]
He's chasing someone. Ceolbert, the only prize worth taking in this mud-sink.

Id: [0x002C0559]
He's chasing someone. Ceolbert, the only prize worth taking in this mud-sink.

Id: [0x002C055E]
That's it!

Id: [0x002C055F]
Not quite.

Id: [0x002C0560]
Exactly. Just like that.

Id: [0x002C0561]
A perfect strike.

Id: [0x002C0563]
Have patience. Find the right moment, then strike.

Id: [0x002C0564]
Use your surroundings when possible. Strike from that haystack, for instance.

Id: [0x002C0565]
How about a challenge? Leap down upon that target from above.

Id: [0x002C0566]
Take that one down from the ledge.

Id: [0x002C0567]
Some targets are trickier than others. Keep that in mind before you strike.

Id: [0x002C056F]
A good plan. We go now.

Id: [0x002C0570]
A good plan. We go now.

Id: [0x002C0572]
Wait here 'til I return.

Id: [0x002C0573]
Wait here 'til I return.

Id: [0x002C0575]
Fine. And remember … leave Rhodri to me.

Id: [0x002C0589]
There is a spot near the fortress to set up camp. We will scout it together.

Id: [0x002C058A]
Murdered.

Id: [0x002C058B]
Murdered.

Id: [0x002C058C]
Lady Angharad said Rhodri is holed up in Caustow Castle. That may have been a lie or a tiny slip. Either way, we should find out.

Id: [0x002C058D]

Id: [0x002C0708]
Fight me here!

Id: [0x002C070A]
Sigurd! Be careful! He's coming for you!

Id: [0x002C070B]
Sigurd! Be careful! He's coming for you!

Id: [0x002C070C]
We shared so much in England. Fought and bled together.

Id: [0x002C0710]
Speak your grievance!

Id: [0x002C0713]
Show yourself!

Id: [0x002C0714]
I do not wish to fight with you.

Id: [0x002C0715]
I do not wish to fight with you.

Id: [0x002C0716]
What does battle serve?

Id: [0x002C071C]
When I have finished, you will be a sack of blood and shattered bones.

Id: [0x002C071D]
And my conscience will be clear.

Id: [0x002C071E]
You will not die in peace.

Id: [0x002C071F]
You will never see your home or your people again!

Id: [0x002C0720]
My son will not have suffered in vain!

Id: [0x002C0722]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C0724]
I want you to suffer!

Id: [0x002C0725]
You spout nonsense. Like an alehouse drunk!

Id: [0x002C0727]
Is this what you wanted?

Id: [0x002C0728]
Is this what you wanted?

Id: [0x002C072A]
You spout nonsense. Like an alehouse drunk!

Id: [0x002C072E]
Ah! You never said this one was a poet!

Id: [0x002C0730]
The bold Sons of Ragnar bellow to sound the spear din and the thunder of shields. So let fall the arrow storm. The battle begins.

To Halfdan King, I lift my horn and raise my brow to speak this praise…

Crown spire, stout oak of Valkyries, spinner of battle wisdom … long may you live and rule. Skal!

Id: [0x002C073C]
Valhalla must look such a sight.

Id: [0x002C073E]
Does he breathe still?

Id: [0x002C0740]
Rhodri! Are you listening? For years I wore this scar with shame. Nicked by a Briton, and left alive!

Id: [0x002C0741]
I tried to cover it with a beard, a cloak. But as your fame grew, I began to beam with pride. A king gave me this mark!

Id: [0x002C0742]
What say you to this, Rhodri? Huh? Speak up, you old bag of sweat and grease.

Id: [0x002C0743]
Barely.

Id: [0x002C0744]
Barely.

Id: [0x002C074C]
I stirred up this storm, I know. And I will not soon forget it. But by the bloody spear of Odin, I will finish it.

Id: [0x002C074E]
We drag our ships ashore, and just then a cry came from atop a hillock. The troll-cursed Britons.

Id: [0x002C074F]
In Quatford, you told me Rhodri gave you that scar on your face. Is it a story worth telling?

Id: [0x002C0750]
In Quatford, you told me Rhodri gave you that scar on your face. Is it a story worth telling?

Id: [0x002C0758]
Load this lump of lard onto your horse and we will go. Take care he stays alive.

Id: [0x002C075A]
So be it. We will be waiting, right Rhodri, old friend?

Id: [0x002C075B]
(gasp of pain)

Id: [0x002C075C]
All right. Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x002C075D]
All right. Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x002C075E]
Not just now. I will return when I'm ready.

Id: [0x002C075F]
Not just now. I will return when I'm ready.

Id: [0x002C0770]
The fires of Muspelheim burn on my tongue! Give me that mead!

Id: [0x002C0771]
Hot! Hot! Hot!

Id: [0x002C0772]
More mead! My mouth is on fire!

Id: [0x002C0773]
Who spiced this meat? I'm sweating like a hog on a butcher's block!

Id: [0x002C077C]
Cold winds howl and snows may fall, but the mead is always warm in Suttungr's halls.

Id: [0x002C077F]
Raising our horns to an Aesir? I never thought I'd see the day.

Id: [0x002C0780]
This Havi must be mighty indeed, if Suttungr honors him so.

Id: [0x002C0781]
Aegir's cauldron has come to Utgard? I'll never be sober again!

Id: [0x002C0782]
Is that Gunlodr? Not often you see her dragged away from her work.

Id: [0x002C0783]
[burp]Aaah, better out than in.

Id: [0x002C079C]
Your treachery will only win you death!

Id: [0x002C079D]
Honored family, friends … welcome! To your new home!

Id: [0x002C07A3]
I never trusted you! Never!

Id: [0x002C07A4]
The Mead is no treasure for the ignorant!

Id: [0x002C07A6]
You're here to steal our secrets!

Id: [0x002C07AA]
I saw you at the feast, Loki! Small wonder you disguised yourself, after all you have done!

Id: [0x002C07AB]
I saw you at the feast, Loki! Small wonder you disguised yourself, after all you have done!

Id: [0x002C07AD]
Did not Augustine make a distinction between faith and understanding? That is my point.

Id: [0x002C07AE]
So you hold no stock in faith, only in rational proof? The science of the divine. You're bold to defy your teachings.

Id: [0x002C07B1]
Out! Out!

Id: [0x002C07B4]
Now then … Leofrith said there are hunters after me. Zealots. If I don't clear my name, I'll be marked for death. I should head to Venonis.

Id: [0x002C07B5]
Now then … Leofrith said there are hunters after me. Zealots. If I don't clear my name, I will be marked for death. I should head to Venonis.

Id: [0x002C07B8]
Documents of interest to the Hidden Ones. Hytham will surely want a look. But for Sigurd, Portcestre is our only lead.

Id: [0x002C07BA]
Anything else?

Id: [0x002C07BB]
Anything else?

Id: [0x002C07BC]
Hm.

Id: [0x002C07BD]
Hm.

It is a good day to die!

The gate looks to be well defended.

We are nearing the village of Nottfall!

Get ready!

Get ready!

Id: [0x002C07E0]
The Ravens claim Nottfall for Odin!

Raze this place! Burn and pillage! And let all who pledge to Kjotve feel the frost of our steel!

Raze this place! Burn and pillage! And let all who pledge to Kjotve feel the frost of our steel!

Id: [0x002C07E7]
Eivor. Sigurd. I give you England … and its four kingdoms.

Id: [0x002C07ED]
Hm. I like it. The poet in you sings once again. One day, this name will be known throughout all of England.

Id: [0x002C07EE]
A name is only a beginning. If we want renown, we must build. Expand.

Id: [0x002C07EF]
Agreed. We should begin with a forge. Can you help Gunnar get working again?

Id: [0x002C07F1]
For that, our neighbors will provide, whether they wish to or not

Id: [0x002C07FD]
A patrol of Eadwyn's men is coming this way. We're going to jump 'em.

Bishop, send word to Lady Angharad. Say that her husband died by treachery. And that Ivarr has paid the price for it.

Id: [0x002C08CE]
Offer an exchange, lord…

Id: [0x002C08CF]
(unintelligible)

Id: [0x002C0934]
From the few plans and maps I discovered here, I believe the Sons of Ragnar have pushed further into Mercia, here…

Id: [0x002C0936]
Here. In this unnamed copse of trees.

Id: [0x002C0937]
Unnamed. We cannot let that stand. What will we call this place?

Id: [0x002C0939]
And where are we?

Id: [0x002C093A]
And where are we?

Id: [0x002C093B]
I might have an idea.

Id: [0x002C093C]
I might have an idea.

Id: [0x002C093D]
We will need cargo, supplies.

Id: [0x002C093E]
We'll need cargo, supplies.

Id: [0x002C0946]
Take the map with you. And put it to better use than they did.

Id: [0x002C094A]
Yes. Bandits know as well as we do, monasteries are full of riches and loot.

Id: [0x002C094B]
Yes. Bandits know as well as we do, monasteries are full of riches and loot.

Id: [0x002C0954]
We'll do this the vikingr way then!

Id: [0x002C0955]
Hard to get through that door without being seen.

The Mead. By this strange magic, might the Aesir evade our doom?

While death and ruin rage all around, the world-tree will keep you. Your body will die, but your hugr will live on here.

Id: [0x002C0A2B]
When Ragnarok has come and gone, this place will remain. Remain, and remember.

Id: [0x002C0A2E]
In time, you will be born anew, into a new world birthed from the ashes of the old.

Id: [0x002C0A39]
Before you take these waters, you must infuse them with the blood of the Aesir. To remember you, it must know you.

Id: [0x002C0A47]
And if I make this sacrifice? What then?

Id: [0x002C0A48]
And if I make this sacrifice? What then?

Id: [0x002C0A49]
Surrender a part of yourself to the waters that nourish the world-tree. Only then will you have that which you desire.

Id: [0x002C0A52]
I must believe it, for there is one I love dearly who depends upon it.

Id: [0x002C0A55]
You never did.

Id: [0x002C0A56]
It seems I have no choice.

Id: [0x002C0A57]
It seems I have no choice.

Id: [0x002C0A5D]
I've no horses I can spare just yet. This one is spoken for.

Wise Mimir, keeper of the well. Give me your counsel.

Id: [0x002C0A8A]
Wise Mimir, keeper of the well. Give me your counsel.

Id: [0x002C0A8C]
None.

Id: [0x002C0A8D]
And there is no other way?

Id: [0x002C0A8E]
And there is no other way?

Id: [0x002C0A92]
Walk with me.

Id: [0x002C0A9C]
Every last one?

Id: [0x002C0A9D]
Every last one?

Id: [0x002C0AC0]
(grunting with effort)

Id: [0x002C0AC1]
Ah!

Id: [0x002C0AC5]
That was well drunk … well done … well … drunk … done.

Id: [0x002C0AC8]
Don't feel bad. Most of these bacrauts would have pissed themselves, or passed by now.

Id: [0x002C0ACC]
We come empty-handed. Not even a gift to offer.

Id: [0x002C0ACD]
We come empty-handed. Not even a gift to offer.

Id: [0x002C0AD3]
Ha!

Id: [0x002C0AD5]
[gasping]H-how…?

Id: [0x002C0AD6]
Come down, Eivor! I have only begun to enjoy this!

Id: [0x002C0AD9]
Once, just once, I'd have him take a bath.

Id: [0x002C0ADB]
He was a king once, that one. You'd never know by the way he sulks.

Id: [0x002C0ADD]
That's not a fear you feel often, I imagine.

Id: [0x002C0ADE]
That's not a fear you feel often, I imagine.

Id: [0x002C0AE1]
Hold a moment, Eivor … let me ask you something…

Id: [0x002C0AF7]
Come on, then. If you're so hot to die.

Id: [0x002C0B20]
Eivor, my stable is a bit spare just now, but if you can build me something better, I promise you the finest of beasts.

Id: [0x002C0B22]
A bustling stable would be a great boon here. I will see what I can do.

Id: [0x002C0B23]
A bustling stable would be a great boon here. I will see what I can do.

Id: [0x002C0B26]
Speak, then. Or I take your tongue.

Speak, then. Or I take your tongue.

Id: [0x002C0B28]
Will you see your father in Valhalla, Wolf-Kissed? Or is the coward in Helheim, weeping tears of ice?

Id: [0x002C0B2F]
That's the last of them. Eadwyn will be waiting for aid that never comes.

Id: [0x002C0B30]
That's the last of them. Eadwyn will be waiting for aid that never comes.

This was worn by your grandfather in a battle on the Northern Way.

Ah, there you are, my little drengr.

Id: [0x002C0B37]
There you are!

Id: [0x002C0B3D]
Ah! You have it!

Id: [0x002C0B40]
Mindless?

Id: [0x002C0B44]
I wish I could help. The night of the attack, I was meditating on the shore, far from prying eyes.

Id: [0x002C0B45]
I was alone that night. And until Saxons appeared, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I hope that's enough.

Id: [0x002C0B46]
I'm trying to find who betrayed Soma to the Saxons. I could use your help.

Id: [0x002C0B47]
I'm trying to find who betrayed Soma to the Saxons. I could use your help.

Id: [0x002C0B4C]
You know me, Eivor. You even backed me when I killed Rhodri's half-wit brother!

Id: [0x002C0B4E]
Have you no sense of menace! When I stabbed Gwriad, you winced. You cower in the face of sudden drama.

Id: [0x002C0B54]
That is no way to call for sacrifices.

Id: [0x002C0B55]
Stomach's grumbling. Haven't had a decent meal in ages.

Id: [0x002C0B56]
Sneeze loud enough and these walls'll come down, looks like.

Id: [0x002C0B57]
Bloody crypt sends chills up my spine.

Id: [0x002C0B62]
You should have helped land the knife!

Id: [0x002C0B64]
I backed you always! Even when you killed Rhodri's brother.

Id: [0x002C0B65]
I backed you always! Even when you killed Rhodri's brother.

Id: [0x002C0B69]
You were too reckless, Ivarr. A storm of mindless chaos.

Id: [0x002C0B6A]
You were too reckless, Ivarr. A storm of mindless chaos.

Id: [0x002C0B6E]
I heard rumors that England was infested with kings already. I thought maybe … maybe you would return here to…

Id: [0x002C0B6F]
Interest you? You robbed me of my wealth when you left for England. I presume you would do it again.

Id: [0x002C0B71]
Done. Nothing but smoke and ashes now. That should get those Zealots off my back.

Id: [0x002C0B72]
Done. Nothing but smoke and ashes now. That should get those Zealots off my back.

Id: [0x002C0B74]
The time for tears is over, you weeping sacks of wool! Put some muscle into those pulls!

Id: [0x002C0B75]
What are you doing? Take up your axe! Wield like a true warrior!

Id: [0x002C0B78]
There you are!

Id: [0x002C0B79]
Hail, drengr! Welcome!

Id: [0x002C0B7A]
Sail southeast. Bring the men to the gates of Tamworth.

Id: [0x002C0B7B]
We'll flood the fields, and Burgred shall weep at the sight of what the future holds for this kingdom!

Id: [0x002C0B80]
Die, dung worm!

Id: [0x002C0D02]
Good work, my dear. And what else have you found?

Id: [0x002C0D03]
Short notes, mostly. Scraps of plans, old letters. A few rune-stone messages.

Id: [0x002C0D04]
It took some time to decipher the mess, and piece it all back together.

Id: [0x002C0E94]
We lack the needed supplies to build Gunnar's forge. I should gather the crew and go raiding.

Id: [0x002C0E95]

Raiding is the surest way to find treasures and supplies for building up our settlement.

Id: [0x002C0EAA]
Excellent.

Id: [0x002C0EAB]
A decent attempt.

Id: [0x002C0EAC]
Nicely done.

Id: [0x002C0F27]
My scouts come and go daily with interesting news and tidings, and I am beginning to get my bearings in this fractured land.

Id: [0x002C0F28]
As I learn more, I can give you insight into each territory, before you commit to a journey there.

Id: [0x002C0F2B]
Once you have gained an ally in a territory, return home and speak to me. We'll decide your next move then.

Id: [0x002C0F2E]
You have two options just now. Join Sigurd in Ledecestrescire to the north, and meet with the Sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002C0F2F]
Where do we start?

Id: [0x002C0F30]
Where do we start?

Id: [0x002C0F33]
I understand. So where do we start?

Id: [0x002C0F34]
I understand. So where do we start?

Id: [0x002C0F98]
Smoke and fire! From Stoneburgh, I think. Trygve may be among them!

Id: [0x002C0F99]
Smoke and fire! From Stoneburgh, I think. Trygve may be among them!

Id: [0x002C0F9B]
I will tend to the injured, but there are many more in danger. Bring them here if you can!

Id: [0x002C0FA0]
O, dear Hemming! Our jarl!

Id: [0x002C0FA1]
He'll soon join our forefathers.

Id: [0x002C0FA4]
Will Hemming Jarl go to Heaven, mother?

Id: [0x002C0FA5]
I… I hope he will. If he has accepted Christ into his heart, the Lord will most certainly receive him.

Id: [0x002C0FA8]
You see? She agrees!

Id: [0x002C0FA9]
This must be Loki's doing.

Id: [0x002C0FAA]
No, no. This is life, my friend.

Id: [0x002C0FB1]
Picts ashore! Protect the convoy!

Id: [0x002C0FB2]
Picts ashore! Protect the convoy!

Id: [0x002C0FB9]
This is how I remember you.

Id: [0x002C0FBA]
This is how I remember you.

Id: [0x002C0FBB]
Hemming Jarl was the greatest man I have ever known.

Id: [0x002C0FBC]
This is not how I remember you.

Id: [0x002C0FBE]
Aaah!

Id: [0x002C0FBF]
Aaah!

Id: [0x002C0FC1]
I trusted you to make the right decision. I still do.

Id: [0x002C0FC4]
Your edge is blunted by indecision. You lead warriors now, never waver.

Id: [0x002C0FC6]
You did, Hemming Jarl. You did.

Id: [0x002C0FC7]
You did, Hemming Jarl. You did.

Id: [0x002C0FD0]
Drink as the great jarl would!

Id: [0x002C0FDC]
Who will take the great jarl's place? Will we decide at the next Althing?

Id: [0x002C0FEA]
Sunniva, ride to Hemthorpe and prepare the longhouse for the Althing. The next jarl will soon take his seat.

Id: [0x002C0FEB]
Sunniva, ride to Hemthorpe and prepare the longhouse for the Althing. The next jarl will soon take his seat.

Id: [0x002C0FEC]
You dare disturb these days of mourning!

Id: [0x002C0FEE]
Stop, Vili. They're gone. It's done.

Id: [0x002C0FEF]
Stop, Vili. They're gone. It's done.

Id: [0x002C0FF2]
Footsteps.

Id: [0x002C0FF3]
Footsteps.

Id: [0x002C0FF4]
A moment to catch my breath.

Id: [0x002C0FFA]
So many Danes, so many Norse. This will be the send-off Hemming deserves.

Id: [0x002C0FFB]
So many Danes, so many Norse. This will be the send-off Hemming deserves.

Id: [0x002C1003]
Vili … gone already. To prepare for the funeral I imagine.

Id: [0x002C1004]
Vili … gone already. To prepare for the funeral I imagine.

Id: [0x002C1016]
Let's hope you fight better than you age, old friend.

Id: [0x002C1018]
You're not slurring, Vili. Have you mislaid your ale?

Id: [0x002C1019]
You're not slurring, Vili. Have you mislaid your ale?

Id: [0x002C101D]
I see what need be seen, when it need be.

Id: [0x002C1020]
Did Hemming Jarl consult you often? Did he unburden his woes?

Id: [0x002C1021]
Did Hemming Jarl consult you often? Did he unburden his woes?

Id: [0x002C1024]
A great gift.

Id: [0x002C1025]
A great gift.

Id: [0x002C1029]
Such humility. Where is the Eivor I once knew?

Id: [0x002C102D]
You can have your glory, Vili. I am here to support you and your father.

Id: [0x002C102E]
You can have your glory, Vili. I am here to support you and your father.

Id: [0x002C1034]
O, no! This is a contest now. To the top of that tower, and the Pict chief is the prize.

Id: [0x002C1035]
We can snatch glory together. Unless you're too frightened to fight beside me.

Id: [0x002C1036]
We can snatch glory together. Unless you're too frightened to fight beside me.

Id: [0x002C103A]
Yet here you are, back with the old clan. That is what matters most.

Id: [0x002C103B]
It has been too long, Vili Hemmingson.

Id: [0x002C103C]
It has been too long, Vili Hemmingson.

Id: [0x002C103D]
A great burden.

Id: [0x002C1058]
I have it here…

Id: [0x002C1059]
I have it here…

Id: [0x002C105D]
In just a moment, Vili. I will return.

Id: [0x002C105E]
In just a moment, Vili. I will return.

Id: [0x002C106A]
The nobles have offered up their funeral gifts. All but you. Present what you have and the celebration may begin.

Id: [0x002C106C]
May the winds favor him.

Id: [0x002C106D]
May the winds favor him.

Id: [0x002C1070]
Move! Move! Get to safety!

Id: [0x002C1071]
Move! Get to safety!

Id: [0x002C1074]
Leave your things! Get to Trygve, you will be safe with him.

Id: [0x002C1075]
Leave your things! Get to Trygve, you will be safe with him.

Id: [0x002C1079]
Speak from your heart, Hemmingson.

Id: [0x002C107A]
Speak from your heart, Hemmingson.

Id: [0x002C1080]
Today we mourn the passing of Hemming Jarl of Snotinghamscire. My father.

Id: [0x002C1082]
Our father.

Id: [0x002C1084]
He was a towering force. A strength to fear and admire, now gone. Yet together we are the example of his greatness.

Id: [0x002C1085]
I see him in each of you.

Id: [0x002C1087]
His love for battle, but also peace. For wisdom, sorrow, and joy. His generosity. His spirit. In you, I see his life.

Id: [0x002C1089]
And …  His love of drink. Gods, did he love drink![laugh]

Id: [0x002C108B]
We are these things because he was these things.

Id: [0x002C108F]
Father. We shall be to our children what you were to us. And when they are ready, we will meet you again.

Id: [0x002C1092]
There is nothing you can do now. Get to safety.

Id: [0x002C1093]
There is nothing you can do now. Get to safety.

Id: [0x002C1097]
Nine days One-Eye hung from the tree. Nine worlds he saw. Nine runes he found. Nine nights he bled.

Id: [0x002C109E]
You have made this old man proud. Each of you.

Id: [0x002C10A2]
Father, receive your loyal servant.

Id: [0x002C10A4]
And you us.

Id: [0x002C10A5]
And you us.

Id: [0x002C10AE]
Give him a fine farewell.

Id: [0x002C10CF]
There were more in the wood.

Id: [0x002C10D1]
But we do not know how many. We should fall back and wait.

Id: [0x002C10D2]
But we do not know how many. We should fall back and wait.

Id: [0x002C10D3]
No no, stop stop. I am fine. There is more blood here than injury.

Id: [0x002C10D5]
We need to clear a path!

Id: [0x002C10E5]
My father placed us side by side, because he trusted your vision. So what do you see?

Id: [0x002C10E6]
You stand side by side, Vili. And one of you must step forward.

Id: [0x002C10E7]
You stand side by side, Vili. And one of you must step forward.

Id: [0x002C10ED]
Hm. It will take time to wear that title with comfort.

Id: [0x002C10EE]
People of Hemthorpe, of Ulkerthorpe, of Snotingham. Today, I pledge myself. As my father was, I shall be your jarl.

Id: [0x002C10FA]
I see a drengr before me. A man who yearns for the glory of battle.

Id: [0x002C10FB]
I see a drengr before me. A man who yearns for the glory of battle.

Id: [0x002C1100]
You know how to ruin a good moment, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002C1102]
To raid with you and Bragi? Gods, yes. Imagine the blood and mead we would spill.

Id: [0x002C1103]
Some time ago you asked about living with us. As one of our war-band. Is that something you still want?

Id: [0x002C1104]
Some time ago you asked about living with us. As one of our war-band. Is that something you still want?

Id: [0x002C110E]
As long as I have known you, Vili, you have possessed a strength you rarely saw in yourself. A wildness. A joy for life.

Id: [0x002C110F]
As long as I have known you, Vili, you have possessed a strength you rarely saw in yourself. A wildness. A joy for life.

Id: [0x002C111A]
If he is not careful, that voda will burn all of Valhalla down.

Id: [0x002C111B]
If he is not careful, that voda will burn all of Valhalla down.

Id: [0x002C111C]
Some voda survived the fire. It will keep Hemming warm in Odin's hall.

Id: [0x002C1122]
No longer besieged by chickens, I see.

Id: [0x002C1123]
No longer besieged by chickens, I see.

Id: [0x002C1124]
Throw the dragons on the fire with the great jarl! We shall devour them together!

Id: [0x002C1129]
Will your god-water survive these flames?

Id: [0x002C112A]
Will your god-water survive these flames?

Id: [0x002C112B]
It will. And should Hemming Jarl so desire, our God will be ready to accept him into the Kingdom of Heaven.

Id: [0x002C112F]
You have done him a kindness by being here. Now do him one more. Have another drink … or ten.

Id: [0x002C1130]
You have done him a kindness by being here. Now do him one more. Have another drink … or ten.

Id: [0x002C1131]
I regret not seeing my great jarl again.

Id: [0x002C1133]
I come on behalf of the mighty Halfdan Ragnarsson of Northumbria. To deliver a gift to the departed Hemming Jarl.

Id: [0x002C1134]
These people are good drinkers, and good warriors. Halfdan will be pleased.

Id: [0x002C113A]
You're a long way from Norway, Wolf-Kissed! Vili will be pleased to know it.

Id: [0x002C113B]
Pour the mead! Eivor's come to Snotingham!

Id: [0x002C1140]
Oars, back us around. The convoy is laid bare.

Id: [0x002C1141]
Oars, back us around. The convoy is laid bare.

Id: [0x002C1142]
Trygve spoke true. You have come to England.

Id: [0x002C1145]
Picts on the ridge! Guard the convoy!

Id: [0x002C1146]
Picts on the ridge! Guard the convoy!

Id: [0x002C1148]
The convoy remains, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002C114C]
The convoy is unscathed. Hemming Jarl will be pleased.

Id: [0x002C1152]
There, the chief.

Id: [0x002C1153]
There, the chief.

Id: [0x002C1156]
That's all of them! But stay on guard.

Id: [0x002C1157]
That's all of them! But stay on guard.

Id: [0x002C1160]
The Exile must value his solitude, living in a hole such as this.

Id: [0x002C1161]
The Exile must value his solitude, living in a hole such as this.

Id: [0x002C116E]
They come for the chief! Stop them!

Id: [0x002C118E]
The Saxon messed what?

Id: [0x002C1190]
What mess does she speak of?

Id: [0x002C1191]
What mess does she speak of?

Id: [0x002C1196]
I didn't see them coming! I never looked down! I never saw them coming!

Id: [0x002C119E]
Not the voda… I love the voda…

Id: [0x002C11A3]
Hemming Jarl was always fair and kind to us.

Id: [0x002C11A4]
Us as well. Have you seen his son, Vili?

Id: [0x002C11AB]
Watch yourself … the voda sneaks up on you quick!

Id: [0x002C11AF]
O my God!

Id: [0x002C11B3]
The sacrifice has been made. Whosoever drinks of the Mead, the world-tree will remember them.

Id: [0x002C11B4]
Rock and snow, stone and squall, Utgard's walls will never fall.

Id: [0x002C11B6]
Wolf-Kissed! Welcome back!

Id: [0x002C11BC]
You are wounded, Broder. Let me bear your brother to the camp.

Id: [0x002C11BD]
You are wounded, Broder. Let me bear your brother to the camp.

Id: [0x002C11C0]
Thunderclap of Thor! Is that your father's axe? I have not seen this beauty since … well, for some time.

Id: [0x002C11C3]
I forged this weapon long ago. Still looks good. One of my finest, I think.

Id: [0x002C11C5]
I can give it a better edge and reinforce the handle. And as luck would have it, I have one ingot left for the job.

Id: [0x002C11D0]
Return anytime!

Id: [0x002C11D1]
That's all for now.

Id: [0x002C11D2]
That is all for now.

Id: [0x002C11D4]
Ja, work is good and my spirits are strong, but my nights are newly cold. My lady left me, if you had not heard.

Id: [0x002C11D6]
Ahh... Five weeks it was. Five beautiful, passionate weeks. But all that is done. Will I never find my Brunhilde?

Id: [0x002C11D8]
Lower? My friend, look at my wares, my weapons. I'm not a man to settle for less than the finest of anything!

Id: [0x002C11DA]
And how are you, Gunnar? Holding up?

Id: [0x002C11DB]
And how are you, Gunnar? Holding up?

Id: [0x002C11DC]
I had. Sorry to hear it. You were together … how long?

Id: [0x002C11DD]
I had. Sorry to hear it. You were together … how long?

Id: [0x002C11DE]
Valkyries do not walk the world as they once did, Gunnar. Maybe set your sights a bit lower.

Id: [0x002C11DF]
Valkyries do not walk the world as they once did, Gunnar. Maybe set your sights a bit lower.

Id: [0x002C11E2]
That should do it. Anything else?

Id: [0x002C11E3]
Do you need anything else?

Id: [0x002C11E4]
No … no … that's not what I mean. Let me … let me explain if I might. How to put it…?

Id: [0x002C11E6]
What I mean to say is, faith is paramount. Yes. For without it, Christ's sacrifice means nothing.

Id: [0x002C11EA]
(groaning)

Id: [0x002C11EB]
(groaning)

Id: [0x002C12CC]
Gulled again!

Id: [0x002C12CF]
You know the Sons of Ragnar?

Id: [0x002C12D6]
So this is where you devise your plans. A cozy room, well lit and fortified.

Id: [0x002C12D7]
I advise. Sigurd and Eivor devise. But yes, it happens right here.

Id: [0x002C12D8]
My father told me once, that all a good army needs is bread, water, and an accurate map.

Id: [0x002C12DA]
Axes and shields are useful as well. But I think your father is on to something.

Id: [0x002C12DB]
Yes, he was simplifying of course. You'd need clothes and rest as well … and good company, of course.

Id: [0x002C12DC]
Not as pithy when you say it like that.

Id: [0x002C12DE]
You said Eivor would be joining us?

Id: [0x002C12DF]
Soon, yes. She was on her way.

Id: [0x002C12E0]
How long do you expect you'll be staying here?

Id: [0x002C12E1]
I don't yet know. Long enough to absorb all your wisdom, I hope.

Id: [0x002C12E2]
You'd have a long gray beard by then, aetheling.

Id: [0x002C12E3]
This map does look a bit old. You could probably find better.

Id: [0x002C12E7]
I haven't forgotten, Eivor. And I won't, for fear that you might remind me.

Id: [0x002C12E9]
Not to frighten you, old friend. But to keep you honest.

Id: [0x002C12EA]
Not to frighten you, old friend. But to keep you honest.

Id: [0x002C12EB]
Aye. Sold many a mare and stallion to the brothers. Good men, always paid me fair.

Id: [0x002C12F7]
Thanks to Sigurd. He was a good guide and even better company. He told me some incredible stories.

Id: [0x002C12F8]
The best ones were about you.

Id: [0x002C12FA]
There were a few gems.

Id: [0x002C12FB]
Not to interrupt, Eivor, but what of Ledecestrescire?

Id: [0x002C1300]
Glad to hear it. Well done to you both.

Id: [0x002C1301]
Ah. Glad to see you made it, Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002C1302]
Ah. Glad to see you made it, Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002C1303]
Hopefully nothing too embarrassing.

Id: [0x002C1304]
Hopefully nothing too embarrassing.

Id: [0x002C1305]
The alliance is won. The Sons of Ragnar are friends to our clan.

Id: [0x002C1306]
The alliance is won. The Sons of Ragnar are friends to our clan.

Id: [0x002C130A]
Stop. It wasn't Ivarr who sent me. I sent myself.

Id: [0x002C130C]
I understand.

Id: [0x002C1314]
I been waiting to get back at these Britons ever since you broke me from that cage, Dane. The time is nigh.

Id: [0x002C1318]
Not this time!

Id: [0x002C131F]
Of course.

Id: [0x002C1320]
Of course.

Id: [0x002C1323]
Give that traitor Ceolwulf my message … he may win this earthly battle, but the Devil has won the war for his soul.

Id: [0x002C1324]
Thirsty?

Id: [0x002C1325]
Thirsty?

Id: [0x002C132A]
Have no fear. It was not my seidr that made her like this. Her condition inspired the elixir.

Id: [0x002C1336]
You have a keen eye, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002C1337]
Svala. You are looking well.

Id: [0x002C1338]
Svala. You're looking well.

Id: [0x002C1339]
Eivor, can you teach me the art of archery?

Id: [0x002C133E]
I would be happy to.

Id: [0x002C133F]
I would be happy to.

Id: [0x002C1340]
Breathe in as you draw the arrow back.

Id: [0x002C1341]
Breathe in as you draw the arrow back.

Id: [0x002C1342]
Look at the point you want to hit. Now imagine the arrow passing straight through it, and far beyond.

Id: [0x002C1343]
Look at the point you want to hit. Now imagine the arrow passing straight through it, and far beyond.

Id: [0x002C1344]
Breathe out, then release.

Id: [0x002C1345]
Breathe out, then release.

Id: [0x002C1347]
And you've told them as much? Cynon is a reasonable man, he'd listen.

Id: [0x002C134C]
He did not. Sicced his guards on me before I could draw breath.

Id: [0x002C134D]
He did not. Sicced his guards on me before I could draw breath.

Id: [0x002C1350]
Eivor. That silver you gave me in Quatford. I traded it for a gold ring.

Id: [0x002C1351]
The ring is from the Levant. Inscribed with a prayer to some god. What is their Valhalla like, I wonder?

Id: [0x002C1352]
Of course!

Id: [0x002C139E]
Gwriad won't need this silver now.

Id: [0x002C139F]
Gwriad won't need this silver now.

Id: [0x002C13A3]
Come on, lads! Roll it to the gate.

Id: [0x002C13A6]
Closer! Closer to the bloody gate!

Id: [0x002C13A8]
Perhaps he bought this with the silver I gave him.

Id: [0x002C13A9]
Perhaps he bought this with the silver I gave him.

Id: [0x002C13BA]
You have not been long in England, have you? I see by this map, you have barely scratched Mercia.

Id: [0x002C13BB]
Give it time, little lord.

Id: [0x002C13BC]
Wessex untouched. Northumbria, barren. You still have much to see.

Id: [0x002C13BE]
Yes. It is a work in progress.

Id: [0x002C13BF]
Ceolbert, did you move my pawns?

Id: [0x002C13C0]
I did! Put them right over there, keep them out of your way when you aren't using them.

Id: [0x002C13C1]
May I man the alliance table for Eivor next time? Get a bit of practice in.

Id: [0x002C13C2]
Absolutely not.

Id: [0x002C13C3]
Understood.

Id: [0x002C13C4]
Eivor. You're back!

Id: [0x002C13C5]
Welcome back! You look well-traveled and rugged.

Id: [0x002C13C6]
Eivor, good day.

Id: [0x002C13C7]
Safe travels.

Id: [0x002C13C8]
Be careful out there.

Id: [0x002C13C9]
Rest assured, Eivor, the settlement is in safe hands.

Id: [0x002C13CB]
Yes, indeed. Your people have been so hospitable. And Randvi has taught me so much about your tactics. Your approach to war.

Id: [0x002C13CD]
But not so much that you might use it against us.

Id: [0x002C13CE]
No, Heaven forfend. In spite of your … invasive introduction to England, you have treated me and my father with kindness.

Id: [0x002C13CF]
In truth, I think he does.

Id: [0x002C13D2]
Ceolbert … getting used to us yet?

Id: [0x002C13D3]
Ceolbert … getting used to us yet?

Id: [0x002C13D4]
Good. I am glad you're fitting in, Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002C13D5]
Good. I am glad you're fitting in, Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002C13E6]
That is … actually a very good idea.

Id: [0x002C13E8]
I am, but … I wish I could have risen to the challenge put before us. Instead of hiding here in the longhouse.

Id: [0x002C13EA]
I know, I just…

Id: [0x002C13EC]
I know, I only wish my father's long shadow didn't darken my prospects here. I want to learn from you, not watch you.

Id: [0x002C13EE]
Ceolbert? Are you well?

Id: [0x002C13EF]
Ceolbert? Are you well?

Id: [0x002C13F0]
You were exactly where you needed to be. Defending the people. And yourself.

Id: [0x002C13F1]
You were exactly where you needed to be. Defending the people. And yourself.

Id: [0x002C13F2]
Our forces outside were sufficient. And your father would have many unkind words for me if anything had happened to you.

Id: [0x002C13F3]
Our forces outside were sufficient. And your father would have many unkind words for me if anything had happened to you.

Id: [0x002C13F4]
I have no doubt. Next time, then.

I have no doubt. Next time, then.

Id: [0x002C13F8]
Greetings, Havi! Will you test your arm at archery? You must hit three targets in a handful of heartbeats.

Id: [0x002C13FA]
Ah, but can you do it while mead-addled? Before each attempt, you must take a drink.

Id: [0x002C13FC]
Ha! That's a condition I'll gladly accept. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002C13FD]
I can shoot the wings off a wasp.

Id: [0x002C13FE]
I can shoot the wings off a wasp.

Id: [0x002C13FF]
I'll take your challenge on one condition. For every drink I take, you take two!

Id: [0x002C1400]
I'll take your challenge on one condition. For every drink I take, you take two!

Id: [0x002C140F]
No. I want you to die defending it.

Id: [0x002C1410]
I did not seek to replace Sigurd. This fate was written for us, long ago.

Id: [0x002C1411]
I did not seek to replace Sigurd. This fate was written for us, long ago.

Id: [0x002C1414]
I will in time. As the flames of my pyre burn, I will ride the path of wood-smoke to the All-Father's hall of champions.

Id: [0x002C141B]
I am grateful to see you once more, jarl. I struggle with the task you set before me. To choose your heir is not an easy thing.

Id: [0x002C141C]
I am grateful to see you once more, jarl. I struggle with the task you set before me. To choose your heir is not an easy thing.

Id: [0x002C141D]
As Sigurd was your chief. But that did not quench your appetite for glory, as you took his place upon the high seat of your clan.

Id: [0x002C1420]
You saw it coming, and you welcomed it.

Id: [0x002C1422]
Shall I renounce my glory, then? Give up the position I have earned?

Id: [0x002C1423]
Shall I renounce my glory, then? Give up the position I have earned?

Id: [0x002C142E]
An age has ended today, Wolf-Kissed. It is on you and Vili and the like to carry our people forward.

Id: [0x002C1440]
The choice you make will be the right one.

Id: [0x002C1444]
You pushed me, Hemming. I never intended this.

Id: [0x002C1445]
You pushed me, Hemming. I never intended this.

Id: [0x002C1446]
I was given a death sentence. Unfairly I felt, but a man was killed.

Id: [0x002C1450]
Have no regrets, Eivor. You have given me the great battle-death I sought in life.

Id: [0x002C1463]
Vili, stop…

Id: [0x002C1464]
Vili, stop…

Id: [0x002C146F]
I brought a gift from the Raven Clan. I stored it at the watchtower on the far side of Hemthorpe.

Id: [0x002C1471]
Did you consult the volva?

Id: [0x002C1473]
And were your questions answered?

Id: [0x002C1477]
Some questions were answered. Others I must answer myself.

Id: [0x002C1478]
Some questions were answered. Others I must answer myself.

Id: [0x002C147A]
Eivor, Trygve has no intention to lead. He feels duty bound to follow his master into death.

Id: [0x002C147E]
Do you forbid me as a friend, Vili? Or as our new jarl?

Id: [0x002C1480]
As a man who would see you come to your senses!

Id: [0x002C1488]
Vili. Trygve. Each man wears one of Hemming's boots, with both men unwilling to seize the other.

Id: [0x002C1489]
Vili. Trygve. Each man wears one of Hemming's boots, with both men unwilling to seize the other.

Id: [0x002C148A]
Grab a shovel from Gorm's storehouse.

Id: [0x002C148B]
No. It is a rotten place, that storehouse. Have you seen it? A bloody mess.

Id: [0x002C149B]
If it's a mess, then clean it, dung-brain.

Id: [0x002C14A0]
Does the world need such useless, dithering men? Why not stake a claim yourself? Take this shire for your own.

Id: [0x002C14A9]
You cannot! I will not allow it!

Id: [0x002C14AC]
Snotinghamscire deserves a leader to admire. A man the people can trust.

Id: [0x002C14AD]
Snotinghamscire deserves a leader to admire. A man the people can trust.

Id: [0x002C14AE]
Most love Vili, and he loves them. But he lacks the will to be leader. He could learn … but does he wish to?

Id: [0x002C14AF]
Most love Vili, and he loves them. But he lacks the will to be leader. He could learn … but does he wish to?

Id: [0x002C14B0]
And Trygve … sturdy and wise and loyal to the legacy Hemming Jarl left behind. Almost to a fault.

Id: [0x002C14B1]
And Trygve … sturdy and wise and loyal to the legacy Hemming Jarl left behind. Almost to a fault.

But he is old and his thrill for living has fled him. Hardly inspiring.

That snake Fulke hides behind walls of stone. But Eivor will drag her out.

Id: [0x002C14C5]
He is dead, Eivor. No breath within him. Gods, I've never seen the raucous bastard so quiet.

Id: [0x002C14CB]
Ah, here's the Raven-Feeder now.

Id: [0x002C14D9]
My liberty. Suttungr and Gunlodr will not forgive this trespass. They will hunt me now, to the edges of the nine worlds.

Id: [0x002C14DC]
The ashes of my husband. He made his own sacrifice for knowledge. With a few changes to this Mead, I may undo old sorrows.

Id: [0x002C14DD]
And you? What is your sacrifice?

Id: [0x002C14DE]
And you? What is your sacrifice?

Id: [0x002C14E3]
Bright-mind, heart's-ease, beloved. I will not fail you again.

Id: [0x002C14E4]
Do as you will. I have had my fill of this cursed realm.

Id: [0x002C14E5]
Do as you will. I have had my fill of this cursed realm.

Id: [0x002C14EA]
King Ricsige…

Id: [0x002C14EB]
King Ricsige…

Id: [0x002C14ED]
Be wary. The Aesir could still be about.

Id: [0x002C14F1]
Who stands before Ivarr Ragnarsson? Are you Sigurd's drengr (courageous warrior)? Aygor?

Id: [0x002C14F2]
Ricsige! There!

Id: [0x002C14F3]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C14F4]
You are a keen shot, Havi! Your hand grows steadier with drink, where others lose their eye.

Id: [0x002C14F6]
Havi, they called themselves. Serpent-tongue, I say.

Id: [0x002C14F7]
Suttungr the Wise! Hah! He was a fool to trust an outsider.

Id: [0x002C14FC]
Wait till I get my hands on that stunty little godling.

Id: [0x002C14FD]
It's only a matter of time before our enemies attack in force.

Id: [0x002C150E]
Eivor, at the outset of our conflict, you gave me a boon of silver to ease our way to peace.

Id: [0x002C1510]
It is fine craftsmanship, my lady. Thank you. I wish you well.

Id: [0x002C1511]
It is fine craftsmanship, my lady. Thank you. I wish you well.

Id: [0x002C1512]
As we have come to peace by another path, I return your silver in form of a small gift. Please accept this.

Id: [0x002C1514]
It will be long until there's another feast in Utgard. As if this place wasn't grim enough.

Id: [0x002C1515]
Eh. The place could use some color.

Id: [0x002C1517]
Who are they?

Id: [0x002C1518]
Who are they?

Id: [0x002C1519]
All spies. Dressed to look the part of a peasant. Got feisty.

Id: [0x002C151B]
Pitchfork. From this rabid little one.

Id: [0x002C1526]
The Aesir may have beaten us back at Asgard, but our time is coming.

Id: [0x002C1527]
Suttungr is always thinking. Don't trust anyone that thinks that much.

Id: [0x002C1528]
These walls are strong, but I long for the peace of the Ironwood.

Id: [0x002C1529]
War brings glory, but there is no greater joy than a plump harvest.

Id: [0x002C152A]
From earth we came, and to the earth we will return.

Id: [0x002C152B]
Was a time when you met and slew your enemy on the field before they could dream of things like sending spies.

Id: [0x002C1530]
You're free, Saxon piggy! To run amok through the Mercian fields.[kiss]

Id: [0x002C1533]
I would have let him down easy.

Id: [0x002C1534]
I would have let him down easy.

Id: [0x002C1584]
Whoa.

Id: [0x002C1585]
A pool of water … from all that melted ice.

Id: [0x002C1586]
Don't look down, don't look down.

Id: [0x002C15A0]
M-my God! Get me out of here! Please!

Id: [0x002C15A7]
Eivor opened the bleedin' gate!

Id: [0x002C15A8]
Over the drawbridge, boys!

Id: [0x002C15AE]
Great Saint John the Baptist, it worked!

Id: [0x002C15AF]
How the devil are we meant to get through there?

Id: [0x002C15B0]
Drawbridge be damned!

Id: [0x002C15B7]
How'll we get through that one?

Id: [0x002C15B8]
Drawbridge!

Id: [0x002C15BA]
Move along, lord. Your king awaits.

Id: [0x002C15BB]
Move along, lord. Your king awaits.

Id: [0x002C166D]
Since my captivity, I felt you were cold and distant. But here your words glow with heart-fire and kindness.

Id: [0x002C166E]
All right … all right … I will come. But only if I may counsel you from time to time, to be better than you are.

Id: [0x002C174B]
It's just up here.

Id: [0x002C174D]
I have no fondness for fishing. Where is the sport in it? There is no chance the fish will kill me.

Id: [0x002C1790]
Sit down.

Id: [0x002C1794]
Not because you're always too drunk to plow?

Id: [0x002C1795]
Not because you're always too drunk to plow?

Id: [0x002C17A2]
Mercia has spoken, lord. The crown…

Id: [0x002C17D5]
I won't back down, Leofrith! I will not!

Id: [0x002C17D6]
Don't make this harder than it has to be, boy.

Id: [0x002C17D8]
There should be an opening in the roof.

Id: [0x002C17D9]
There should be an opening in the roof.

Id: [0x002C17F1]
What don't I do here? You're looking at a man of boundless skill and talent.

Id: [0x002C17F2]
I sell the finest and rarest items in the world! So rare, that I have never held onto any one object for longer than a few days!

Id: [0x002C17F3]
Only in opal, yes! But that I can offer too, for England is not a fount of such rainbow stones.

Id: [0x002C17F4]
My guild, The Thousand Eyes, offers contracts that pay in opal. If you're interested, I always have one or two open.

Id: [0x002C17F8]
Reda. What is it you do here?

Id: [0x002C17F9]
Reda. What is it you do here?

Id: [0x002C1800]
I light a candle for him every day at Vespers.

Id: [0x002C1801]
I visited Tamworth. Ceolbert is interred there in a beautiful tomb.

Id: [0x002C1802]
I visited Tamworth. Ceolbert is interred there in a beautiful tomb.

Id: [0x002C1804]
I received word from King Ceolwulf. He has interred Ceolbert in Tamworth. The lad merits a visit.

Id: [0x002C1806]
In honor of his memory, yes.

Id: [0x002C1807]
In honor of his memory, yes.

Id: [0x002C180A]
God go with you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C180B]
I am honored. I leave you here to your music, good bishop.

Id: [0x002C180C]
I am honored. I leave you here to your music, good bishop.

Id: [0x002C1811]
There we are. Nice to have a more permanent spot.

Id: [0x002C1830]
Save that for later.

Id: [0x002C1831]
Save that for later.

Id: [0x002C1833]
Layla. You can't run away from this.

Id: [0x002C1834]
The day is new, and the air is bracing. Are you ready for the fight ahead?

Id: [0x002C1843]
Never. Let them come.

Id: [0x002C1844]
We need to fall back. Follow me. Quickly!

Id: [0x002C1846]
That sound. Is it thunder?

Id: [0x002C1847]
I am not asking for your permission. Only your forgiveness.

Id: [0x002C185D]
Have I seen Vili? I wish to see more of him!

Id: [0x002C185E]
Don't we all … O Lord please forgive me…

Id: [0x002C186C]
Why have you not reached Odin's hall?

Id: [0x002C186D]
Why have you not reached Odin's hall?

Id: [0x002C1870]
Fine place for a jarl to hide.

Id: [0x002C1871]
Fine place for a jarl to hide.

Id: [0x002C1874]
I miss him, your father. His long stories most of all.

Id: [0x002C1875]
I miss him, your father. His long stories most of all.

Id: [0x002C1878]
Do you remember how he'd sing us to sleep?

Id: [0x002C1879]
Do you remember how he'd sing us to sleep?

Id: [0x002C187A]
I should return to Hemthorpe soon.

Id: [0x002C187C]
And I to my clan. But for now, our paths keep us here, Vili Jarl.

Id: [0x002C187D]
And I to my clan. But for now, our paths keep us here, Vili Jarl.

Id: [0x002C187E]
Ah! A reaping of flesh from the wave!

Id: [0x002C1880]
I can share it with you, so the Jarl of Snotinghamscire does not return home empty handed and head hanging.

Id: [0x002C1881]
I can share it with you, so the Jarl of Snotinghamscire does not return home empty handed and head hanging.

Id: [0x002C1885]
It is not my place.

Id: [0x002C1886]
It is not my place.

Id: [0x002C1889]
Not entirely, old friend. I also said you were a bringer of good omens, which proved to be true.

Id: [0x002C188B]
When last we met, you said your chin-grass was no jarl-beard. It seems time has proven you wrong.

Id: [0x002C188C]
When last we met, you said your chin-grass was no jarl-beard. It seems time has proven you wrong.

Id: [0x002C188F]
Find him at Kinder Downfall. For the time being, he has swapped his blade for a fishing rope … to my relief.

Id: [0x002C1890]
Old friend. I trust Vili suits you as well as Hemming.

Id: [0x002C1891]
Old friend. I trust Vili suits you as well as Hemming.

Id: [0x002C1892]
Wolf-Kissed! Vili Jarl's off at Kinder Downfall, fishing rope in tow.

Id: [0x002C1895]
Facing wolves and Picts can grow tiresome. But this quiets the mind. Come. Fish with me.

Id: [0x002C189B]
You soften with age, Wolf-Kissed. And now you have your own tales to tell. Put your skalds to work.

Id: [0x002C189D]
I'd close my eyes and dream that my mother was alive, by the hearthside. I believed he sung to her.

Id: [0x002C189F]
He sang to you both.

Id: [0x002C18A0]
He sang to you both.

Id: [0x002C18A7]
Show me those targets.

Id: [0x002C18A8]
Show me those targets.

Id: [0x002C18AA]
We can do this later.

Id: [0x002C18AB]
We can do this later.

Id: [0x002C18AD]
Of spirit. Not of flesh.

Id: [0x002C18B0]
Hemming Jarl? Is it truly you?

Id: [0x002C18B1]
Hemming Jarl? Is it truly you?

Id: [0x002C18B2]
Forget wise counsel and rational arguments. What does your heart tell you?

Id: [0x002C18B3]
Forget wise counsel and rational arguments. What does your heart tell you?

Id: [0x002C18B4]
Then take a drink, and let fly!

Id: [0x002C18B5]
You return! Keen to stretch your bowstring?

Id: [0x002C18BF]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002C18C2]
Picts were spotted moments ago, lurking in the thicket. Vili gave chase.

Id: [0x002C18C5]
Let us wake the others. The dark is lousing with Picts.

Id: [0x002C18CA]
Hm? Sunniva?

Id: [0x002C18CB]
Hm? Sunniva?

Id: [0x002C18CC]
Arse-Stick, he should have roused me first. Show me where he went.

Id: [0x002C18CD]
Arse-Stick, he should have roused me first. Show me where he went.

Id: [0x002C18D2]
I can take them on myself. Tell me where.

Id: [0x002C18D3]
I can take them on myself. Tell me where.

Id: [0x002C18DA]
Tell no one of this. The last thing we need is a dozen more bodies for Hemming's pyre.

Id: [0x002C18DB]
Tell no one of this. The last thing we need is a dozen more bodies for Hemming's pyre.

Id: [0x002C18DC]
This will be a fine tale to tell after the Althing. But until then, we stay quiet.

Id: [0x002C18DD]
This will be a fine tale to tell after the Althing. But until then, we stay quiet.

Id: [0x002C18E2]
The nobles are too drunk to join this fight. It would be a slaughter on both sides.

Id: [0x002C18E3]
The nobles are too drunk to join this fight. It would be a slaughter on both sides.

Id: [0x002C18E6]
You know best, drengr. Just … take care, will you?

Id: [0x002C18EA]
Not for me. My belly roils like a knot of eels … and I see three of you. I think I should walk this off…

Id: [0x002C18EB]
Another round?

Id: [0x002C18EC]
Another round?

Id: [0x002C1943]
This is fine work, really. Thank you for seeing this done.

Id: [0x002C1945]
This is perfect, Eivor! You really are a generous one.

Id: [0x002C1949]
We keep your longship fine and fit. My husband focuses on style and appearance.

Id: [0x002C194A]
Whereas my beloved wife concerns herself with speed and functionality. And if you happen to find any ship plans about…

Id: [0x002C194B]
Bring them to us and we'll see what we can do with them.

Id: [0x002C194C]
Of course, we haven't got much space to work with just yet. So until you can build us a shipyard, we'll talk of other things.

Id: [0x002C194F]
Tell me more about what you and Gudmund do here in the shipyard?

Id: [0x002C1950]
Tell me more about what you and Gudmund do here in the shipyard?

Id: [0x002C1973]
Here you are. More relics for your collection.

Id: [0x002C1974]
Here you are. More relics for your collection.

Id: [0x002C1991]
What happened…?

Id: [0x002C1992]
No… No! You foolish boy, what did you do!

Id: [0x002C1994]
A king forged by Viking battle-wisdom and Christian compassion. A formidable man, he would have been.

Id: [0x002C199B]
Save my son first! Please!

Id: [0x002C19A9]
No, no. We will speak with them, get the lay of the land. And carve this country into as many pieces as we see fit.

Id: [0x002C19AF]
Look there! What are they doing?

Id: [0x002C19B1]
Baptism, Dag. Are the ways of Christians really so unfamiliar to you?

Id: [0x002C19B2]
Not at all! I simply forgot. And someone has to keep the conversation up.

Id: [0x002C19B8]
Sigurd, do the Sons of Ragnar know that we are coming?

Id: [0x002C19B9]
Sigurd, do the Sons of Ragnar know that we are coming?

Id: [0x002C19BE]
Come to! Stop the boats! Pull up over there.

Id: [0x002C19BF]
The way forward is blocked by a chain spanning the river. We must remove it before pressing on.

Id: [0x002C19C1]
And I will be right behind you!

Id: [0x002C19C2]
No, Dag. You stay here. Should trouble come our way, I want you defending the ship.

Id: [0x002C19C3]
A good idea. Send out the arrow and keep your sharpest axe at hand, eh?

Id: [0x002C19C4]
Something like that.

Id: [0x002C19C6]
I will go.

Id: [0x002C19C7]
I will go.

Id: [0x002C19C8]
A Dane! A Dane has come!

Id: [0x002C19CC]
The chain is away! Eivor, back to the boat!

Id: [0x002C19CD]
Fine work, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C19D0]
Gods, I'm ravenous! I hope they have food and ale on hand when we arrive.

Id: [0x002C19D1]
If Halfdan, Ubba, and Ivarr Ragnarsson are lacking food in England, then all of us will starve. Have no worry.

Id: [0x002C19D2]
Ah, I can see it now! A suckling pig, tender and juicy. And ale as gold as the treasures that we failed to steal back there.

Id: [0x002C19D4]
What giants?

Id: [0x002C19DC]
A man of simple pleasures, aren't you, Dag?

Id: [0x002C19DD]
A man of simple pleasures, aren't you, Dag?

Id: [0x002C19E2]
Who are these men?

Id: [0x002C19E4]
Dag, Eivor … on me.

Id: [0x002C19E5]
They speak with twisted accents. English, no doubt.

Id: [0x002C19E6]
They speak with twisted accents. English, no doubt.

Id: [0x002C19E8]
What?

Id: [0x002C19EA]
I am ready.

Id: [0x002C19EC]
Eivor, I wondered if I would ever see you again. It's … it's good to see you.

Id: [0x002C19ED]
Yes, Father. Well enough.

Id: [0x002C19EE]
You and Sigurd make a good pair. The future of England will be pagan from top to bottom.

Id: [0x002C19F3]
Six times they have tried to save us. Six times they have failed. Forgive me if I have my doubts.

Id: [0x002C19F4]
The Mother is working on a seventh. A bold solution … risky. But she is confident it can work.

Id: [0x002C19F5]
And what does the Father say? Or the Voice? They are strangely silent these days…

Id: [0x002C19F8]
Curse that Mad One, that one-eyed wretch! He has taken our son! Imprisoned him for invented crimes and locked him away!

Id: [0x002C19F9]
As he said he would, love. Do you not remember his threats? You should have been more careful.

Id: [0x002C19FA]
Have we no power to stop him? To save our son? No recourse?

Id: [0x002C19FB]
What can we say? And to whom? Must the world know about our children? Must your wife learn of us? Is that a risk you want to take?

Id: [0x002C19FC]
I must do something! Anything!

Id: [0x002C19FE]
My love, what happened? You are flushed, trembling.

Id: [0x002C19FF]
An eye for an eye. A son for a son. For if ours must suffer needlessly to the end of his life, so too will his tormentor.

Id: [0x002C1A00]
What … what have you done?

Id: [0x002C1A01]
The poor boy collapsed so suddenly. Felled by the faintest taste of mistel-berry. With his father standing over him, weeping![laugh]

Id: [0x002C1A02]
Reckless, foolish! Were you seen? Do they know it was you?

Id: [0x002C1A05]
Have you heard? The High Council has stripped the Mother of her title. For gifting our tormentor her seventh method of salvation.

Id: [0x002C1A06]
The seventh method? Is it viable? Why were we not told?

Id: [0x002C1A07]
I've heard whispers and rumors. It seems the seventh requires a human host.

Id: [0x002C1A08]
A human host? Do you mean … rebirth? As one of them?

Id: [0x002C1A09]
Yes. But it's a small loss for a greater gain. A risk we must be willing to take.

Id: [0x002C1A0A]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C1A0B]
The Mad One is away, wandering in lands afar. He searches for a way to resurrect his son. Asking every leaf and stone for answers.

Id: [0x002C1A0C]
We can use this to our advantage. To steal the seventh, the serum and its catalyst.

Id: [0x002C1A0D]
It should be ours. For all the suffering he has wrought.

Id: [0x002C1A0E]
Our minds are attuned, love. As sympathetic strings.

Id: [0x002C1A0F]
When the time is right, just right, we'll go.

Id: [0x002C1A10]
Wake, my love, wake! Soldiers at our door. They've come for you! For us.

Id: [0x002C1A11]
Let them take me. I have no more fear. Let me air my wrath in the courts.

Id: [0x002C1A12]
They'll kill you before they let you speak!

Id: [0x002C1A13]
I'll appeal to the Council. They must know what the Mad One has done.

Id: [0x002C1A14]
They're upon us! Now is not the time!

Id: [0x002C1A15]
Ah! Stop … stop!

Id: [0x002C1A16]
Keep still, love. You're injured. Now let me see…

Id: [0x002C1A17]
Ah! No … no more, please. Let me … let me die. Here. Where all is quiet.

Id: [0x002C1A18]
No! This is … this is NOT your end. There is a way. A Piece of Eden, a staff attuned to this method of transfer. It may work!

Id: [0x002C1A19]
Or I may end up like the outcast's husband. A beating heart without a mind. But do what you must … I see no other way.

Id: [0x002C1A1A]
Be still, love. And let the current flow. Let it take you.

Id: [0x002C1A1B]
Is this…? This is dangerous. It may not work.

Id: [0x002C1A1C]
Until we have the serum, this is all we can manage.

Id: [0x002C1A1D]
Will you not ask the Mad One for me? Ask him for the serum. Beg him for it.

Id: [0x002C1A1E]
He would not listen. And I would sooner see our world obliterated before I gave that man a view of me on my knees.

Id: [0x002C1A1F]
My love, are you there? Speak and tell me you live.

Id: [0x002C1A20]
I … I live. If this is living. A mind without a body.

Id: [0x002C1A21]
And do you feel?

Id: [0x002C1A22]
I feel myself. My sense of being. Nothing more. Nothing less. No pain or … or joy … or passage of time.

Id: [0x002C1A23]
And yet, you are with me. And I with you. And together we will endure.

Id: [0x002C1A24]
My love, the time is now. The cataclysm is upon us. The Mad One has gathered his trusted eight to his secret hall.

Id: [0x002C1A25]
Remember the calculations. You must act with precision. Every small step must be accounted for.

Id: [0x002C1A26]
I'll remember. They are burned into my brain.

Id: [0x002C1A27]
How long till your rebirth?

Id: [0x002C1A28]
A long time, love. You must wait in your endless present, and I will sail the black sea of nonbeing.

Id: [0x002C1A29]
Thanks for the good work, Eivor! Got a real little fishery going here.

Id: [0x002C1A37]
Ah! With this we can recruit more warriors. Now I can build the most vicious crew ever to sail the rivers of England.

Id: [0x002C1A59]
But you had best get some barracks built soon. I need a place to cage these beasts.

Id: [0x002C1A5D]
A fine shelter, it is. When word gets out, it should attract many jomsvikings to fight with us.

Id: [0x002C1A5E]
Which reminds me. A few of your raiders are chomping at the bit in hope of becoming your second. You ought to pick one.

Id: [0x002C1A6C]
Our warriors now have a place to rest and train.

Id: [0x002C1A6D]
Our warriors now have a place to rest and train.

Id: [0x002C1A6E]
All right, bring out my lieutenant.

Id: [0x002C1A6F]
All right, bring out my lieutenant.

Id: [0x002C1A78]
But if all goes well, I'll find you again. On the far side of our doom. We'll be together. Again.

Id: [0x002C1A79]
Ah ah ahh. The boy becomes more like his father with each moon, though he spends little time in his chair.

Id: [0x002C1A89]
The mead has not been the same since Aegir lost his cauldron in a wager.

Id: [0x002C1A8A]
Ale makes allies of us all.

Id: [0x002C1A8B]
Aegir's hall. The only place where Aesir and Jotnar may meet in peace.

Id: [0x002C1A8D]
I drink to forget the doom that must befall us.

Id: [0x002C1A8F]
The winds blow cold, but there is always a fire in Aegir's hearth.

Id: [0x002C1A9C]
Thank you, Havi. We'll stir their blood, all right!

Id: [0x002C1A9D]
You have your instrument, skald. Now strike a merry tune, fit to raise a horn to.

Id: [0x002C1A9E]
You have your instrument, skald. Now strike a merry tune, fit to raise a horn to.

Id: [0x002C1AA0]
Well, besides forging the finest weapons and armor in the land, I am happy to set to work on anything you find.

Id: [0x002C1AA1]
I can restore all weapons to their former glory. And well beyond, if that is what's wanted. I can improve any blade.

Id: [0x002C1AA2]
So as long as you have the resources and the cargo, I will gladly work on your gear.

Id: [0x002C1AA4]
Tell me more about what you do here, Gunnar.

Id: [0x002C1AA5]
Tell me more about what you do here, Gunnar.

Id: [0x002C1B84]
Randvi, my dear wife.

Id: [0x002C1B89]
A chain? Can we cut through it?

Id: [0x002C1B8A]
It's too thick for axes. But there must be a way to release it somewhere in that camp.

Id: [0x002C1BA1]
Forest Father. Take this body. Eat of him and feed the land. Cernunnos, hear my plea and guide my hand. Cut down our foes.<LF>And fill our fields with grain to sow.

Id: [0x002C1BA2]
Didn't know I could read these, but … that's the bleeding effect, I guess.

Id: [0x002C1BCA]
I have it. Sending it over.

Id: [0x002C1BCC]
I got it. Be ready.

Id: [0x002C1BCE]
I got the data. Here it comes.

Id: [0x002C1BD0]
Got it.

Id: [0x002C1C18]
Yes, here we are. My anomalies. Let's see how these turned out.

Id: [0x002C1C1B]
That's a damn fine stable we have now. Lord, look at it!

Id: [0x002C1C1D]
Hmmm. I suppose it will do for the moment. Though it lacks the grandiosity of the Empire at its peak.

Id: [0x002C1C24]
And here … the fragment of an ancient memory.

Id: [0x002C1C25]
O thank you, Eivor. This … this is the place we needed.

Id: [0x002C1C6B]
What a life you led, Eivor. What a saga you lived. If only someone had written it down…

Id: [0x002C1C6F]
Have I stepped into Alfheim, or is this a new realm entirely?

Id: [0x002C1C70]
Have I stepped into Alfheim, or is this a new realm entirely?

Id: [0x002C1C73]
It is a role he chose. He bent easily, and broke in half. Do not pity him.

Id: [0x002C1C75]
He deserves nothing but shame now.

Id: [0x002C1C76]
No.

Id: [0x002C1C77]
No.

Id: [0x002C1C79]
Yes. Face to face. I will tell him the truth.

Id: [0x002C1C7A]
You want to speak with him?

Id: [0x002C1C7B]
You want to speak with him?

Id: [0x002C1C7F]
No, he must taste the same foulness that I taste. He must know what glory he missed by staying here, the lapdog of a conqueror.

Id: [0x002C1C83]
We'll search the meadhalls.

Id: [0x002C1C84]
That's right.

Id: [0x002C1C85]
That's right.

Id: [0x002C1C87]
We should look there.

Id: [0x002C1C88]
Stop. That is far enough.

Id: [0x002C1C89]
You should have sent word ahead of us, Sigurd. To get something on the spit.

Id: [0x002C1C8A]
The great Romans and their empire, giants of a forgotten age. They held dominion here, long ago, and their ruins dot the landscape.

Id: [0x002C1C92]
Come. The swiftest path is by river, but these waters are hostile to Norsemen.

Id: [0x002C1CDB]
Not a metaphor I would use just now. Not in his state.

Id: [0x002C1CDC]
Not a metaphor I'd use just now. Not in his state.

Id: [0x002C1CE2]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002C1CE4]
You would always be welcome to live and prosper with us. But that is a matter between you and your father.

Id: [0x002C1CE5]
You would always be welcome to live and prosper with us. But that is a matter between you and your father.

Id: [0x002C1CE6]
I have my own reasons to see you made jarl. The Raven Clan wants friends in England. And you are among my very best.

Id: [0x002C1CE7]
I have my own reasons to see you made jarl. The Raven Clan wants friends in England. And you are among my very best.

Id: [0x002C1CEA]
You do not need me in that seat to secure an alliance. You and Sigurd are beloved here.

Id: [0x002C1CEB]
You defy a long tradition, Vili. The son takes after his father, that is the way of things.

Id: [0x002C1CEC]
You defy a long tradition, Vili. The son takes after his father, that is the way of things.

Id: [0x002C1CF2]
Your father is dying, Vili. Now is the time to get your house in order.

Id: [0x002C1CF3]
Your father is dying, Vili. Now is the time to get your house in order.

Id: [0x002C1CF4]
You have a chance to end on good terms with your father. I wasn't afforded the same luxury. Don't squander it.

Id: [0x002C1CF5]
You have a chance to end on good terms with your father. I wasn't afforded the same luxury. Don't squander it.

Id: [0x002C1CF9]
I could make the old man understand. For I have no desire to be jarl, and he must accept that.

Id: [0x002C1CFA]
[sigh]I only want sun on my skin and an axe in my hand. Ale and adventure! Not the staid life of a jarl.

Id: [0x002C1CFD]
It is, but a sad one … I suppose I was the age you are now. Skadi had sent us a harsh winter and much of our clan was starving.

Id: [0x002C1CFE]
To feed us, my family incurred a large work-debt. But my youth rendered me too proud to pay it off. I wanted to raid, not toil.

Id: [0x002C1CFF]
For my failure, Hemming Jarl could've taken what he wanted from my family. Including our lives. But his heart is kind.

Id: [0x002C1D00]
He spared us, and I pledged myself to him. Gladly so. So it has ever been.

Id: [0x002C1D02]
I remember when Vili and I were small children, you spun many epic yarns for us over the hearth-fire.

Id: [0x002C1D03]
I remember when Vili and I were small children, you spun many epic yarns for us over the hearth-fire.

Id: [0x002C1D05]
Are you sure you want my father's mead? Not afraid you might wake up tomorrow, naked, face down in a hog's pen?

Id: [0x002C1D0A]
Is that what you call your house?

Id: [0x002C1D0B]
Is that what you call your house?

Id: [0x002C1D0C]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C1D0D]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C1D14]
All right. But if I don't faint at the sight of them, you have oversold the view.

Id: [0x002C1D15]
All right. But if I don't faint at the sight of them, you have oversold the view.

Id: [0x002C1D18]
And you accept it. Unlike my son. He thinks me immortal … because he must. He does not want what I have to give him.

Id: [0x002C1D19]
You're injured.

Id: [0x002C1D1A]
You're injured.

Id: [0x002C1D1B]
Pride cannot heal you Hemming. Only care and bandages.

Id: [0x002C1D1C]
Pride cannot heal you Hemming. Only care and bandages.

Id: [0x002C1D31]
By his unrivaled prowess on the battlefield.

Id: [0x002C1D32]
By his unrivaled prowess on the battlefield.

Id: [0x002C1D40]
By his wisdom, always an inspiration.

Id: [0x002C1D41]
By his wisdom, always an inspiration.

Id: [0x002C1D7E]
Will he not be jarl of this shire before the day's end?

Id: [0x002C1D81]
That remains to be seen. Some are more eager to see Trygve in the high seat.

Id: [0x002C1D82]
That remains to be seen. Some are more eager to see Trygve in the high seat.

Id: [0x002C1D85]
This one sought to spark a new flame, but did so with a heavy hand, not a teacher's tongue.

Id: [0x002C1DFD]
These woods whisper with Jotnar magic. Not everything is as it seems.

Id: [0x002C1DFE]
These woods whisper with Jotnar magic. Not everything is as it seems.

Id: [0x002C1E00]
Angrboda's home was right here when last I visited. It may still be.

Id: [0x002C1E01]
Angrboda's home was right here when last I visited. It may still be.

Id: [0x002C1E03]
The witch's house. There you are.

Id: [0x002C1E04]
The witch's house. There you are.

Id: [0x002C1E09]
Empty. The witch is gone, and Loki with her.

Id: [0x002C1E0A]
Empty. The witch is gone, and Loki with her.

Id: [0x002C1E30]
Don't be scared of that crumble-bones!

Id: [0x002C1E31]
My lambs hit harder than you!

Id: [0x002C1E32]
Can you not beat an old woman?

Id: [0x002C1E33]
Is she too strong for you?

Id: [0x002C1E34]
Perhaps a babe would be more suited to your strength.

Id: [0x002C1E48]
Steady eye, now! The last one is the hardest.

Id: [0x002C1E57]
Come, give it a try! What's the worst that can happen?

Id: [0x002C1E58]
Last time I played your game, I got so drunk I shot my brother in the leg.

Id: [0x002C1E61]
Close your eyes, your luck will improve!

Id: [0x002C1E62]
Let us hope you hold your beer better than you hold a bow!

Id: [0x002C1E63]
You look a bit wobbly there. Careful!

Id: [0x002C1E69]
What is a feast without music? I want to dance!

Id: [0x002C1E6A]
I've seen more life in a grave mound.

Id: [0x002C1E6C]
Give it to me! I want a go!

Id: [0x002C1E6D]
Get your grubby paws off my harp!

Id: [0x002C1E6E]
My turn! My turn!

Id: [0x002C1E75]
How many broken bones, you think?

Id: [0x002C1E76]
Bet they won't do it!

Id: [0x002C1E79]
We will not fail again, Eivor. I'll scout ahead, and send word to the settlement when I know more of Portcestre. Be ready.

Id: [0x002C1E7A]
I must tell my people at the settlement that their jarl remains a captive. They will not take it well.

Id: [0x002C1E7B]
I must tell my people at the settlement that their jarl remains a captive. They will not take it well.

Id: [0x002C1E7C]
You jump next!

Id: [0x002C1E7D]
No, you!

Id: [0x002C1E7E]
I'm not going, no way.

Id: [0x002C1E7F]
My people are itching for a fight, Basim.

Id: [0x002C1E80]
And they'll have one.

Id: [0x002C1E81]
Enough talk, my axe is rusting while we sit here.

Id: [0x002C1E82]
If that is Odin's wish, then so be it.

Id: [0x002C1E83]
Are you so eager to see Valhalla, Bragi?

Id: [0x002C1E92]
Who will challenge our champion? Who among you is brave enough?

Id: [0x002C1E95]
Not you too! You'll break the strings with your sausage fingers!

Id: [0x002C1E96]
They beat the champion? Nobody's ever beaten the champion!

Id: [0x002C1E97]
Drink in the name of Havi!

Id: [0x002C1EA6]
The kitchen. Here I might find some way to make the guests thirsty.

Id: [0x002C1EA7]
The kitchen. Here I might find some way to make the guests thirsty.

Id: [0x002C1EAB]
Fifty at least. Maybe a hundred!

Id: [0x002C1EB1]
I do not think you will, Eivor. I think you will marvel at what I have to show you.

Id: [0x002C1EB2]
Mm…

Id: [0x002C1EB4]
Still dwelling on your father?

Id: [0x002C1EB5]
Still dwelling on your father?

Id: [0x002C1EB7]
Of course not. You are as stalwart as a pillar of stone.

Id: [0x002C1EB8]
I saw the great beast Fenrir, the branches of the world tree, and a man with…

Id: [0x002C1EB9]
I saw the great beast Fenrir, the branches of the world tree, and a man with…

Id: [0x002C1EBC]
Describe them for me, your visions.

Id: [0x002C1EBD]
Describe them for me, your visions.

Id: [0x002C1EC0]
As the visions grew stronger, the door opened, revealing many things. The life tree Yggdrasil. The golden fields of Valhalla.

Id: [0x002C1EC1]
They are real, Eivor. And this is no mere foxhunt. Where I take you now, few men have ever seen.

Id: [0x002C1EC4]
Come now. My destiny awaits.

Id: [0x002C1EC7]
Strange how these earthly concerns seem so distant to me.

Id: [0x002C1EC8]
Guthrum's army will be chasing him across Wessex now. With luck, he will push Aelfred into the sea.

Guthrum's army will be chasing him across Wessex now. With luck he'll push Aelfred into the sea.

Id: [0x002C1ECA]
Things so strange and wonderful, I am almost grateful for her treachery.

Id: [0x002C1ECB]
And no one believed us when we were young and we chiseled our plans under tables in meadhalls.

Id: [0x002C1ECD]
There is the Sigurd I know well. Can we not return to England and finish together what we began?

Id: [0x002C1ECE]
There is the Sigurd I know well. Can we not return to England and finish together what we began?

Id: [0x002C1ED0]
I'll be there.

Id: [0x002C1ED1]
I'll be there.

Id: [0x002C1EDF]
What is this…?

Id: [0x002C1EE0]
What is this…?

Id: [0x002C1EE2]
Your visions were … they were real.

Id: [0x002C1EE3]
Your visions were … they were real.

Id: [0x002C1EE5]
To the field! Fight with us!

Id: [0x002C1EE7]
Shouldn't have been so greedy, Tonna. Right. Back to the brothers.

Id: [0x002C1EE8]
Shouldn't have been so greedy, Tonna. Right. Back to the brothers.

Id: [0x002C1EEF]
The battle we never had.

Id: [0x002C1EF0]
The battle we never had.

Id: [0x002C1EF4]
Swine!

Id: [0x002C1EF8]
You'll have to kill me!

Id: [0x002C1EFA]
This kingdom is mine. Mine!

Id: [0x002C1EFD]
Luckily for you, it won't come to that.

Id: [0x002C1EFE]
Luckily for you, it won't come to that.

Id: [0x002C1F02]
No, he died a coward. Yet by Odin's eye, I swear I have seen him.

Id: [0x002C1F03]
No, he died a coward. Yet by Odin's eye, I swear I have seen him.

Id: [0x002C1F06]
Never!

Id: [0x002C1F0D]
Do you not tire of these injuries?

Id: [0x002C1F0E]
Do you not tire of these injuries?

Id: [0x002C1F0F]
Ah!

Id: [0x002C1F10]
Ah!

Id: [0x002C1F17]
Nonsense. I've brought you someone. Look.

Id: [0x002C1F1C]
You wished to see your father. I made it happen. As easy as breathing.

Id: [0x002C1F1F]
No, he…

Id: [0x002C1F20]
No, he…

Id: [0x002C1F22]
I must find Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C1F23]
I must find Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C1F24]
No. I am no one in that world.

Id: [0x002C1F28]
Every day, the same empty war, the same hollow victory. Spilling blood that tastes of water and smells of grass.

Id: [0x002C1F29]
Every day, the same empty war, the same hollow victory. Spilling blood that tastes of water and smells of grass.

Id: [0x002C1F2A]
Am I destined to follow you everywhere? 'Til the end of my life?

Id: [0x002C1F2C]
All right. We go.

Id: [0x002C1F2D]
Walk with me.

Id: [0x002C1F2E]
Do dreams not inspire? Do dreams not make us fearful? Do they not push men to their greatest glories?

Id: [0x002C1F30]
This way.

Id: [0x002C1F32]
Put your weapon away. There is no need to fight.

Id: [0x002C1F3F]
Take up your axe!

Id: [0x002C1F43]
Let us speak!

Id: [0x002C1F44]
Let us speak!

Id: [0x002C1F46]
Yah!

Id: [0x002C1F47]
Yah!

Id: [0x002C1F48]
Let us make this more interesting. We'll drag Sigurd into the fray!

Id: [0x002C1F49]
Leave me now and you are nothing!

Id: [0x002C1F4C]
I could not give you any more counsel in life, Eivor. So too in death am I rendered silent.

Id: [0x002C1F59]
Not my thing.

Id: [0x002C1F5A]
And now we shake hands and make deals.

Id: [0x002C1F5B]
And now we shake hands and make deals.

Id: [0x002C1F6E]
He'd better be worth all this trouble.

Id: [0x002C1F71]
Mercian soldiers! Marching on Repton.

Id: [0x002C1F73]
Leofrith…

Id: [0x002C1F74]
Loyal to the ugly end, the bastard.

Id: [0x002C1F78]
Ceolbert is there. Eivor, you must save my son.

Id: [0x002C1F7B]
Gather what men you have and split them between the north and south gates. That should divide his forces.

Id: [0x002C1F7C]
Gather what men you have and split them between the north and south gates. That should divide his forces.

Id: [0x002C1F7D]
He will come through this. I promise.

Id: [0x002C1F7E]
He'll come through this. I promise.

Id: [0x002C1F80]
I still need to consider.

Id: [0x002C1F81]
I still need to consider.

Id: [0x002C1F87]
We should cast our eyes towards home. It's a long journey and I am … not well.

Id: [0x002C1F88]
We should cast our eyes towards home. It's a long journey and I am … not well.

Id: [0x002C1F89]
You struck Basim, you lashed out at me, you made a fool of us all. That is not a leader I wish to follow into death and glory.

Id: [0x002C1F8B]
I … I understand. Is that all?

Id: [0x002C1F8C]
I … I understand. Is that all?

Id: [0x002C1F8D]
A true leader would have stopped that thought before it took form. You were selfish.

Id: [0x002C1F8F]
I saw things differently then.

Id: [0x002C1F90]
I saw things differently then.

Id: [0x002C1F91]
My heart is stopped. It says nothing.

Id: [0x002C1F9C]
One man is beloved, but does not want the task. The other man is fit for the task, but is not favored.

Id: [0x002C1F9D]
One man is beloved, but does not want the task. The other man is fit for the task, but is not favored.

Id: [0x002C1FA0]
Coward.

Id: [0x002C1FA1]
I don't see you jumping.

Id: [0x002C1FA2]
I'm not ready yet!

Id: [0x002C1FA5]
Come creatures. You are to serve the gods and bid them welcome our beloved Hemming Jarl with ale and open arms.

Id: [0x002C1FA8]
I thought I might have to rescue you, Vili.

Id: [0x002C1FA9]
I thought I might have to rescue you, Vili.

Id: [0x002C1FAE]
I will not underestimate her this time.

Id: [0x002C1FAF]
I will not underestimate her this time.

Id: [0x002C1FB1]
Ah, by Thor's Thunder-hammer … that quickened the blood!

Id: [0x002C1FB8]
They're not far. I'll show you.

Id: [0x002C1FBE]
Forgive me.

Id: [0x002C1FBF]
Forgive me.

Id: [0x002C1FC1]
What's the second worst?

Id: [0x002C1FC3]
I cannot say how I will feel tomorrow, Eivor…

Id: [0x002C1FC7]
The great Halfdan Ragnarsson sent a beautiful gift with his men. As have all those who loved Hemming.

Id: [0x002C1FC9]
As he must.

Id: [0x002C1FCA]
As he must.

Id: [0x002C1FD8]
…off a cliff and into the ocean, if that is what you need.

Id: [0x002C1FD9]
…off a cliff and into the ocean, if that is what you need.

Id: [0x002C1FDA]
There are more people trapped within. Free them, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C1FE2]
I must be away for a short time, Eivor. I want to retrieve something for my father. A gift.

Id: [0x002C1FF3]
Father does not visit here anymore. He sees no profit in it. But I am not yet ready to give up.

Id: [0x002C2004]
Some time ago, we made powerful magic here. We sought to see all futures. But every road led to Ragnarok.

Id: [0x002C2006]
I have seen images of the future. Heard the voices of those who will come after us.

Id: [0x002C2007]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002C2008]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002C200B]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002C2011]
Voices from … in there?

Id: [0x002C2012]
Voices from … in there?

Id: [0x002C2014]
The cauldron has grown smaller. I am getting the measure of these illusions.

Id: [0x002C2015]
The cauldron has grown smaller. I am getting the measure of these illusions.

Id: [0x002C2016]
Why wait till Ragnarok, when you can die now?

Id: [0x002C2017]
I will feed your corpse to Fenrir!

Id: [0x002C2019]
When my son is loosed from his bondage, he will ravage all of Asgard!

Id: [0x002C201A]
You might be strongest, but I was ever the quicker one!

Id: [0x002C201B]
Yes. I leave them words. Little packets of possibility, waiting for unknown ears, many ages hence.

Id: [0x002C2026]
Don't be shy! Test your fists against the champion!

Id: [0x002C2027]
Who's in the mood for a brawl?

Id: [0x002C202C]
Are you there, prophet? Can you hear me?

Id: [0x002C2032]
So it would seem. But many still try. Perhaps one day someone will succeed.

Id: [0x002C2036]
She cannot be beaten!

Id: [0x002C2037]
She cannot be beaten!

Id: [0x002C203C]
They seek the wisdom of the past. They speak of things to come. But even they cannot turn the tide of Ragnarok.

Id: [0x002C203D]
What do these future voices say?

Id: [0x002C203E]
What do these future voices say?

Id: [0x002C2041]
There is no time for rest. Ragnarok will be upon us soon. My people rely on me.

Id: [0x002C2042]
It may be you need a break from your toil, Gunlodr.

Id: [0x002C2043]
It may be you need a break from your toil, Gunlodr.

Id: [0x002C2061]
You were being secretive then. Foolish, I thought.

Id: [0x002C2062]
You were being secretive then. Foolish, I thought.

Id: [0x002C2063]
It ... It is cold out here!

Id: [0x002C2065]
I haven't been outside in … hm, I do not know how long.

Id: [0x002C2067]
Not my work. My responsibility. My people ignore the disaster bearing down on them. Someone must do something.

Id: [0x002C2068]
We have long searched for a solution, until the burden of it has bent my mind. I do not think as clearly as I once did.

Id: [0x002C2069]
How can that surprise you?

Id: [0x002C206A]
How can that surprise you?

Id: [0x002C206B]
You are devoted to your work.

Id: [0x002C206C]
You are devoted to your work.

Id: [0x002C207B]
Brother, please stay. Your place is with us. In England. Our home is your home.

Id: [0x002C207C]
Brother, please stay. Your place is with us. In England. Our home is your home.

Id: [0x002C207D]
My road forward has been a muddy one, slick with blood and tears. But we can reach its end together.

Id: [0x002C207E]
My road forward has been a muddy one, slick with blood and tears. But we can reach its end together.

Id: [0x002C207F]
But here our paths must diverge.

Id: [0x002C2081]
I believed you were wrong then. I still do.

Id: [0x002C2082]
I believed you were wrong then. I still do.

Id: [0x002C2085]
I expect nothing less.

Id: [0x002C2086]
I expect nothing less.

Id: [0x002C2088]
I welcome this turn of kindness, Eivor. But my mind is fixed.

Id: [0x002C208B]
Utgard, ancient keep of the Jotnar. Suttungr holds sway within those walls.

Id: [0x002C208C]
Utgard, ancient keep of the Jotnar. Suttungr holds sway within those walls.

Id: [0x002C208E]
I must take care. Jotnar have little love for my kind.

Id: [0x002C208F]
I must take care. Jotnar have little love for my kind.

Id: [0x002C2098]
A tale for the ages.

Id: [0x002C209C]
We two ragged ravens … what a saga we have inscribed together.

Id: [0x002C209D]
We two ragged ravens … what a saga we have inscribed together.

Id: [0x002C20A5]
You questioned my methods, my aims … but you did not disobey.

Id: [0x002C20A7]
Thank you, Brother. I … I won't let you down.

Id: [0x002C20A8]
Thank you, Brother. I … I won't let you down.

Id: [0x002C20AA]
He did what he felt was right. And I honored that.

Id: [0x002C20AB]
He did what he felt was right. And I honored that.

Id: [0x002C20AE]
One will lead to the other in time.

Id: [0x002C20B0]
Ivarr, are you training the boy or tormenting him?

Id: [0x002C20B1]
Ivarr, are you training the boy or tormenting him?

Id: [0x002C20B5]
Bishop Deorlaf. We are deaf to offers of peace until Gwriad is returned to us.

Id: [0x002C20BA]
Any man who would call a tree murderous is a man who has had one too many blows on the head.

Id: [0x002C20BB]
Any man who would call a tree murderous is a man who has had one too many blows on the head.

Id: [0x002C20BC]
Ah, the diplomat speaks what she really feels.

Id: [0x002C20BE]
Fine shot! Now have a drink and try another.

Id: [0x002C20D8]
Havi!

Id: [0x002C20DA]
That will be enough for Angrboda. I should find my way out.

Id: [0x002C20DB]
That will be enough for Angrboda. I should find my way out.

Id: [0x002C20DC]
Indeed, you are mighty! You have fought old age and won. No one has ever done that before.

Id: [0x002C20DE]
All of you! Empty your horns for Havi!

Id: [0x002C20DF]
Drink to me, then, as you promised you would.

Id: [0x002C20E0]
Drink to me, then, as you promised you would.

Id: [0x002C20E6]
Steady…

Id: [0x002C20E8]
Huh!

Id: [0x002C20E9]
This is … this is Eivor's Valhalla. Or-or, a simulation of it.

Id: [0x002C20EB]
Something feels off…

Id: [0x002C2127]
Ceolbert, I would know your mind on all this. Are you satisfied with our victory?

Id: [0x002C2128]
Ceolbert, I would know your mind on all this. Are you satisfied with our victory?

Id: [0x002C212E]
I … I believe I am. I'll need word from Rhodri as soon as possible. What does he intend?

Id: [0x002C212F]
Your father Ragnar left a strong saga.

Id: [0x002C2130]
Your father Ragnar left a strong saga.

Id: [0x002C213A]
At least the silver gave you happiness. It bought me none.

Id: [0x002C213B]
At least the silver gave you happiness. It bought me none.

Id: [0x002C213D]
That I have.

Id: [0x002C213F]
Quite a story, Ivarr. Son of Ragnar, killer of kings, conqueror of England and the Western Isle. You have lived a saga worth ten.

Id: [0x002C2140]
Quite a story, Ivarr. Son of Ragnar, killer of kings, conqueror of England and the Western Isle. You have lived a saga worth ten.

Id: [0x002C2142]
I had taken a bit of a beating, put me in a surly mood. I wanted blood and silver, nothing more.

Id: [0x002C2146]
If you hear me farting, that is my welcome to the bastard!

Id: [0x002C2155]
You must be the dockmaster.

Id: [0x002C2156]
You must be the dockmaster.

Id: [0x002C2164]
Some help here!

Id: [0x002C2165]
Some help here!

Id: [0x002C2166]
(moan)

Id: [0x002C2168]
Shhh. Save your strength.

Id: [0x002C2169]
Shhh. Save your strength.

Id: [0x002C216B]
Ivarr! Deorlaf!

Id: [0x002C216C]
Ivarr! Deorlaf!

Id: [0x002C216F]
(moan)

Id: [0x002C2172]
So me and my drengir (courageous warriors), sailing along the coast of Cymru, see a nice spot for landing, covered in mist.

Id: [0x002C2174]
Ahh... Bastard kicked me in the liver. [laughs]I need some fresh air.

Id: [0x002C2175]
Now comes the dragon, to feed on his favorite meal … the blood eagle!

Id: [0x002C2177]
Ivarr, is this--

Id: [0x002C2178]
Ivarr, is this--

Id: [0x002C217D]
That is a Norseman. The true essence of old heroes.

Id: [0x002C217F]
(working grunt)

Id: [0x002C2180]
The method will always outlive the meaning. Few in time will care why this man died. But the how, that is a song for the ages.

Id: [0x002C2181]
Now I pull back the flesh.

Id: [0x002C2182]
(scream)

Id: [0x002C2184]
Life is not pretty. It is a bloody fight.

Id: [0x002C2185]
Out come the lungs. And we spread them like wings…!

Id: [0x002C2188]
The blood eagle has no true meaning for Ivarr. He is doing it simply to take pleasure in suffering.

Id: [0x002C2189]
The blood eagle has no true meaning for Ivarr. He is doing it simply to take pleasure in suffering.

Id: [0x002C218A]
There is nothing glorious here.

Id: [0x002C218B]
There is nothing glorious here.

Id: [0x002C218E]
The fog between good and evil grows thick over time. But glory never fades.

Id: [0x002C218F]
(scream)

Id: [0x002C2194]
[panting]My long road ends. The Valkyries approach.

Id: [0x002C2198]
Ah…

Id: [0x002C219B]
I hear … I hear their wings…

Id: [0x002C21A2]
Do not shame him.

Id: [0x002C21A3]
Do not shame him.

Id: [0x002C21A4]
To Helheim with you.

Id: [0x002C21A5]
To Helheim with you.

Id: [0x002C21A6]
(sigh)

Id: [0x002C21A7]
(sigh)

Id: [0x002C21A9]
And send a message to Ubba. Tell him … his brother is dead.

Id: [0x002C21AA]
And send a message to Ubba. Tell him … his brother is dead.

Id: [0x002C21B1]
I will console myself with the thought that we will meet again in Valhalla, axe in hand.

Id: [0x002C21B2]
Bishop. Ubba.

Id: [0x002C21B3]
Bishop. Ubba.

Id: [0x002C21B4]
He told me himself.

Id: [0x002C21B5]
He told me himself.

Id: [0x002C21B8]
He is felled by it. Still, he makes plans for this shire. I am to be ealdorman here.

Id: [0x002C21BB]
As soon as I am able.

Id: [0x002C21BE]
God go with you, Eivor. Wherever you may lead.

Id: [0x002C21BF]
I am grateful, bishop.

Id: [0x002C21C0]
I am grateful, bishop.

Id: [0x002C2201]
[laugh]Indeed.

Id: [0x002C2203]
But I do not remember you telling us how you came to serve Hemming Jarl. Is it a tale worth telling?

Id: [0x002C2204]
But I do not remember you telling us how you came to serve Hemming Jarl. Is it a tale worth telling?

Id: [0x002C2206]
A story of quiet honor. If we had more tales of that kind, the world might be a more forgiving place.

Id: [0x002C2207]
A story of quiet honor. If we had more tales of that kind, the world might be a more forgiving place.

Id: [0x002C2209]
Movement on the walls!

Id: [0x002C220A]
We must end this soon. Before the weather changes.

Id: [0x002C220E]
There will be an Althing soon, in which the nobles must name a new jarl. And I am torn.

Id: [0x002C220F]
You're sick.

Id: [0x002C2210]
You are sick.

Id: [0x002C2211]
You have it, of course.

Id: [0x002C2212]
You have it, of course.

Id: [0x002C2213]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C2214]
My father carries that weight. I do the fighting and feasting and I am expert at both.

Id: [0x002C2215]
That is your domain, Trygve. I don't wish to be seen as a savior and healer all in one afternoon.

Id: [0x002C2224]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C2228]
Father…

Id: [0x002C222B]
We must prepare for the funeral.

Id: [0x002C2234]
If tradition held, yes.

Id: [0x002C2235]

I would give all that and more.

Yet you see it coming. You welcome it.

Id: [0x002C2334]
No. I want you to die in defense of it.

Id: [0x002C25B0]
Ah! More wolves! And not our new friend!

Id: [0x002C25BF]
Not anymore. We stormed the fortress and took the lady back to Tamworth.

They would have killed you, Ceolbert. You had no choice.

Id: [0x002C25C4]
They would have killed you, Ceolbert. You had no choice.

Id: [0x002C25C5]
She would know where Burgred's hiding.

Id: [0x002C25C7]
I must find the witch Angrboda. She knows all that happens here.

Id: [0x002C25C8]
I must find the witch Angrboda. She knows all that happens here.

Id: [0x002C25CA]
If one had the means to pay it.

Id: [0x002C25CD]
I will hold you to it.

Id: [0x002C25CE]
I will hold you to it.

Id: [0x002C25D0]
I know she is! We saved her!

Id: [0x002C25D4]
There. An elixir to ready your spirit.

Id: [0x002C25D6]
While we wait, let us speak of Asgard. How fared your defenses after the last attack?

Id: [0x002C25D8]
I want to kill him!

Id: [0x002C25D9]
I want to kill him!

Id: [0x002C25DB]
For the same reason you are in Jotunheim. You seek the Mead, and I can help you get it.

Id: [0x002C25DC]
Then why release me at all?

Id: [0x002C25DD]
Then why release me at all?

Id: [0x002C25E6]
There! I want that Dane cleaved and butchered!

Id: [0x002C25E7]
You crossed me, lovely dove. Did you think I wouldn't find out?

Id: [0x002C25E8]
The Mead is kept by Suttungr and his daughter Gunlodr in the vault at their home in Utgard.

Id: [0x002C25EF]
[laugh]Do you hear this? Havi fears he will drink us dry!

Id: [0x002C25F3]
In legend, you may be remembered as the king and queen who abandoned their kingdom in its darkest hour.

Id: [0x002C25F4]
In legend, you may be remembered as the king and queen who abandoned their kingdom in its darkest hour.

Id: [0x002C25F6]
Did you see that! She flew!

Id: [0x002C2621]
This Havi must be mighty indeed, if Suttungr honors her so.

Id: [0x002C2626]
But not for Jotnar. Not for me.

Id: [0x002C2627]
For the safety of my people, Loki! For Aesir, for Vanir, for all Asgard!

Id: [0x002C2628]
For the safety of my people, Loki! For Aesir, for Vanir, for all Asgard!

Id: [0x002C262D]
The probabilities lead us here. The calculations give us hope.

Id: [0x002C2631]
Do you have the Mead?

Id: [0x002C2633]
The Mead is not magic alone. It requires the sacred waters of Mimir's well to ferment into its final state.

Id: [0x002C2635]
Speaking with someone?

Id: [0x002C2636]
Speaking with someone?

Id: [0x002C2651]
Do you vouch for this strangeness?

Id: [0x002C2652]
Do you vouch for this strangeness?

Id: [0x002C2653]
Six times we tried to blunt the fangs of Ragnarok, and six times we failed. The Mead was our seventh.

Id: [0x002C2655]
I have things to do yet before I can leave.

Id: [0x002C2656]
I have things to do yet before I can leave.

Id: [0x002C268E]
And what about me? What about my wares?

Id: [0x002C268F]
You can have your wares back when you pay the docking tax.

Id: [0x002C2695]
On whose authority do you impose a tax?

Id: [0x002C2696]
By order of the Council of Jorvik. You can take up your issues with them.

Id: [0x002C26A6]
What gave it away?

Id: [0x002C26AA]
These merchants are not my friends, but I am looking for some. Hjorr and Ljufvina.

Once you catch the tail, you do not let go.

Id: [0x002C26BB]
Once you catch the tail, you do not let go.

Id: [0x002C26C7]
As I just explained to your friend there, if your wares have been seized, take it up with the council.

Id: [0x002C26CB]
This must be Jorvik. The Order of Ancients lurk in its streets and alleys.

Id: [0x002C26CC]
This must be Jorvik. The Order of Ancients lurk in its streets and alleys.

Id: [0x002C26D2]
You may be glad to hear they fare quite well in Jorvik.

Here, this is their home.

Id: [0x002C26DD]

He's a good man.

Id: [0x002C2736]
Hooked! Bring it to shore.

Id: [0x002C2737]
Well done, but we're fishing for eel.

Id: [0x002C2738]
Is that how Danes fish?

Id: [0x002C2739]
That's enough for now. Bishop Deorlaf will be pleased. Let's go tell Ivarr about our catch.

Id: [0x002C273E]
Ivarr.

Id: [0x002C273F]
Ivarr.

Id: [0x002C2740]
Not so easy after supping at the brook of the cheer-cup, eh? When you feel ready, take a drink and try again.

Id: [0x002C2771]
King Rhodri.

Id: [0x002C2772]
King Rhodri.

Id: [0x002C2784]
You were right about him, Ceolbert. And right to believe the line that divides us can be thinner than it seems.

Id: [0x002C2785]
You were right about him, Ceolbert. And right to believe the line that divides us can be thinner than it seems.

Id: [0x002C279A]
They're in the camp.

Id: [0x002C2804]
I will not fish. You go ahead.

Id: [0x002C282F]
Eivor, my friend.

Id: [0x002C2834]
Our fates are weaved together, lovely dove!

Id: [0x002C2835]
Let's finish this now! You and me!

Id: [0x002C2839]
Well done, Eivor. After so long, it finally occurs to you to search for our jarl. I applaud your halfhearted effort.

Id: [0x002C283B]
Someone needs to stay home and direct the affairs of the settlement.

Id: [0x002C283E]
No. I am needed here.

Id: [0x002C2840]
Say whatever makes you feel superior, Eivor. I know Sigurd will understand my decision.

Id: [0x002C2842]
A fine way of putting it, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002C2843]
But go … find the jarl, bring him back. Only do not get lost along the way, as you seem to more and more these days.

Id: [0x002C2845]
Dag. Basim has brought word of Sigurd's location. We are leaving at once to find him.

Id: [0x002C2846]

Dag, this is no joke. On the ship. Now.

Id: [0x002C2849]
Sigurd's life is at stake. We need you there.

Id: [0x002C284A]
Sigurd's life is at stake. We need you there.

Id: [0x002C284B]
If you wish to stay, so be it. But when Sigurd is back among us, we will see what status you have among the raiders.

Id: [0x002C284C]
If you wish to stay, so be it. But when Sigurd is back among us, we will see what status you have among the raiders.

Id: [0x002C284D]
Do you doubt me so completely that you will not raise an axe to save your jarl?

Id: [0x002C284E]
Do you doubt me so completely that you will not raise an axe to save your jarl?

Id: [0x002C284F]
This is not done, Dag. We will speak when I return.

Id: [0x002C2850]
This is not done, Dag. We will speak when I return.

Id: [0x002C287E]
I didn't know there was a land north of there. What are the people like?

Id: [0x002C2880]
You ever see a herd of sheep follow each other off the edge of a cliff? They're like that. The ones who remained, anyway.

Id: [0x002C288A]
Eivor! You have returned. But … has Hunwald not come with you?

Id: [0x002C288E]
No… Gods, no, don't say it. Please, Eivor, don't say it.

Id: [0x002C2890]
O, my Huwald! No. My poor swan, O gods!

Id: [0x002C2894]
O gods, I know he would have fainted to hear such praise from your lips. Thank you, Eivor. Thank you.

Id: [0x002C2896]
Swanburrow, I…

Id: [0x002C2897]
Swanburrow, I…

Id: [0x002C2898]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x002C2899]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x002C289A]
I know words are a poor salve for a wounded heart. I will leave you to mourn.

Id: [0x002C289B]
I know words are a poor salve for a wounded heart. I will leave you to mourn.

Id: [0x002C289C]
He fought bravely, and turned the tide to secure a victory. Your dear Hunwald died a hero, and will be so remembered.

He walks among warriors now.

Id: [0x002C289F]
He walks among warriors now.

Id: [0x002C28A1]
There you are. Let us take King Rhodri to a spot he will find … breathtaking?

Id: [0x002C28C0]
I felled the rotting old oak.

Id: [0x002C28FB]
That is the question. Whatever it is, there's no length they will not go to retrieve them.

Id: [0x002C2906]
I will get started at once.

Id: [0x002C2907]
I will get started at once.

Id: [0x002C290D]
Where is the largest collection of texts in the city?

Id: [0x002C290E]
Where is the largest collection of texts in the city?

Id: [0x002C291D]
That does not surprise me. He's been using Jorvik's money shortage to increase taxes. As if he's been ordered to by the council.

Id: [0x002C291E]
[scoff]Politics. It takes the Norse out of a Norse.

Id: [0x002C2920]
I would swallow a horse heart to join you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C293F]
The Firebrand's flame burns no longer. It was Jorvik's abbess, Ingeborg.

Id: [0x002C2940]
The Firebrand's flame burns no longer. It was Jorvik's abbess, Ingeborg.

Id: [0x002C2958]
Gods, I would have never suspected. Does The Order's reach know no bounds?

Id: [0x002C295B]
None. And it is often those we least expect who carry out their ambitions.

Id: [0x002C295C]
None. And it is often those we least expect who carry out their ambitions.

She did utter a phrase that perked my ears - "One of the four is ours."

Id: [0x002C2960]
Four? But there are only three targets in Jorvik. Could there be something we're missing?

Id: [0x002C2969]
The Needle will never sting again.

Id: [0x002C296A]
The Needle will never sting again.

Id: [0x002C2977]
While King Ricsige is preoccupied with a money shortage, a group called the Red Hand has been imposing their will.

Id: [0x002C2979]
Yes and no. They are bandits, but someone is controlling them.

Id: [0x002C297B]
The ones who attacked you?

Id: [0x002C297C]
The ones who attacked you?

Id: [0x002C297D]
Look no further than the names in that letter. Killing them is the reason I am here.

Id: [0x002C297E]
Look no further than the names in that letter. Killing them is the reason I am here.

Id: [0x002C29AD]
We made it! Vinland is ours. Now take me to the rivers of gold.

Id: [0x002C29AE]
Who promised you gold? There is nothing here but rain, trees, and Gorm's stormy temper.

Id: [0x002C29B0]
Do not suck the wind from my sails, Njall. I will find what I am looking for.

Id: [0x002C29B9]
Settle for half that amount and maybe Ceolwulf's first command won't be for your head on a platter.

Id: [0x002C29BA]
Settle for half that amount and maybe Ceolwulf's first command won't be for your head on a platter.

Id: [0x002C29BE]
You speak nonsense, Basim!

Id: [0x002C29BF]
You speak nonsense, Basim!

Id: [0x002C29C0]
Rise!

Id: [0x002C29C2]
It was never gone, Eivor. Not truly. Nothing is permanent here, I told you. Nothing save the courage and reputation of its warriors.

Id: [0x002C29C3]
[laugh]Let us discover that together!

Id: [0x002C29CF]
Help!

Id: [0x002C29D2]
But why?

Id: [0x002C29D4]
Tonna…

Id: [0x002C29D5]
Tonna…

Id: [0x002C29D7]
Hel watches over you now, lovely dove.

Id: [0x002C29D8]
Hel watches over you now, lovely dove.

Id: [0x002C29DB]
That settles that.

Id: [0x002C29DC]
That settles that.

Id: [0x002C29DE]
Eivor, we will press on. The rest of you, wait here!

Id: [0x002C29E0]
Gods! What is this place?

Id: [0x002C29E1]
Gods! What is this place?

Id: [0x002C29E6]
You are finished!

Id: [0x002C29E7]
You are finished!

Id: [0x002C29E8]
Ah, the music of the battle-din!

Id: [0x002C29E9]
Ah, the music of the battle-din!

Id: [0x002C29EA]
Look at me, Sigurd!

Id: [0x002C29EB]
Look at me, Sigurd! Look at me!

Id: [0x002C29EC]
Ha!

Id: [0x002C29ED]
Ha!

Id: [0x002C29EF]
For Odin!

Id: [0x002C29F0]
(howl)

Id: [0x002C29F1]
Face me, drengr! Show me what you are made of!

Id: [0x002C29F2]
All hail the endless battle!

Id: [0x002C29F4]
Enough with those sword-flies. You and I must fight.

Id: [0x002C29F5]
Sigurd, this place is incredible.

Id: [0x002C29F6]
Sigurd, this place is incredible.

Id: [0x002C29F9]
Sigurd … your arm has grown back.

Id: [0x002C29FA]
Sigurd … your arm has grown back.

Are we immortal in this place?

Id: [0x002C29FC]
Are we immortal in this place?

Id: [0x002C29FF]
You are the Wolf-Kissed one, who lingered at the edge of death, yet fought back.

Id: [0x002C2A00]
You spilled the raven-wine of battle to paint whole kingdoms red.

Id: [0x002C2A01]
You stood tall where your brother stumbled, yet you still came to his aid.

Id: [0x002C2A02]
You have felled many great foes in your brief time.

Id: [0x002C2A08]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002C2A09]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002C2A0A]
What just happened?

Id: [0x002C2A0B]
What just happened?

Id: [0x002C2A0C]
That cannot have been my father…

Id: [0x002C2A0D]
That cannot have been my father…

Id: [0x002C2A0E]
Do not mock us, whoreson. You splattered blood on our peace with the butchery of young Ceolbert!

Id: [0x002C2A0F]
Speak what nonsense you please, Dane. If you mean war, our defenses are sure.

Id: [0x002C2A10]
Yet I cleared your path. I guided your axe!

Id: [0x002C2A12]
You were a fly, buzzing in my ear!

Id: [0x002C2A13]
You were a fly, buzzing in my ear!

Id: [0x002C2A17]
Ah!

Id: [0x002C2A18]
Forgive my nerves. Here I am, an upright man who never once learned how to bend the knee.

Id: [0x002C2A1A]
And yet … I shall try. Ah, how simple it is. How easy to kneel without fear … and feeling.

Id: [0x002C2A1F]
He's mocking you, man! I'd kill the fucker.

Id: [0x002C2A20]
I look like a man up to his neck in sheep shit. Please, I'm telling the truth!

Id: [0x002C2A21]
Worry not, Dane. I shall resign this crown, and this pagan infested kingdom, and the favors of these two-faced men…

Id: [0x002C2A23]
I taught him to protect himself.

Id: [0x002C2A25]
Not well enough, this was stuck in his chest.

Id: [0x002C2A26]
Not well enough, this was stuck in his chest.

Id: [0x002C2A2A]
Keep steady! It should not be far now!

Id: [0x002C2A2B]
Ah. It is bitter cold. As wind from Nifelheim!

Id: [0x002C2A2C]
Ah. It is bitter cold. As wind from Nifelheim!

Id: [0x002C2ACE]
Just a soft little squeal. Then nothing.

Id: [0x002C2ACF]
No.

Id: [0x002C2AD0]
No.

Id: [0x002C2AFC]
We are not here to drink or make merry. Only to look upon the wreckage of a once great man.

Id: [0x002C2AFE]
And then what? Make new war against King Harald? Stake a claim on his crown? Is that your wish? To sow more chaos here?

Id: [0x002C2AFF]
You are absurd, old man. What could possibly interest me in this frozen backwater?

Id: [0x002C2B03]
You left us with nothing when you pledged for King Harald. We took only what we deserved.

Id: [0x002C2B04]
You left us with nothing when you pledged for King Harald. We took only what we deserved.

Id: [0x002C2B07]
I have cast aside all dreams of kingship, Father. A much greater end lies in wait for me.

Id: [0x002C2B0B]
As a father, as a king, as a man. For without it, I would not have discovered my true self.

Id: [0x002C2B0D]
My failure, as you call it … my oath to King Harald … was the only sensible path forward for a man in my situation.

Id: [0x002C2B4B]
I want it all destroyed. Every text, every passage, every scribbled piece of paper. Everything. It is time to end this.

Id: [0x002C2B50]
We have all come a long way.

Id: [0x002C2B51]
We have all come a long way.

Id: [0x002C2B53]
Skal!

Id: [0x002C2B54]
Skal!

Id: [0x002C2B56]
I have. And I mean to stay.

Id: [0x002C2B57]
I have. And I mean to stay.

Id: [0x002C2B63]
Well done, Eivor. Who was hiding behind the name--

Id: [0x002C2B65]
The Needle. Sold off the wares he seized to collect silver for The Vault.

Id: [0x002C2B66]
The Needle. Sold off the wares he seized to collect silver for The Vault.

Hail, friend.

Id: [0x002C2B7C]
Hail, friend.

Id: [0x002C2B91]
The Christian texts will lead to another, I'm sure of it. Search the archives.

Id: [0x002C2B9D]
They mourn. It is to be expected. Still, thank you.

Id: [0x002C2B9F]
I mourn more deeply than most, I think.

Id: [0x002C2BA1]
I hope so.

Id: [0x002C2BA3]
Yes. It will.

Id: [0x002C2BA4]
I've calmed the guests as much as they can be in their grief.

Id: [0x002C2BA5]

And how do you feel, old friend?

Id: [0x002C2BA7]
And how do you feel, old friend?

Id: [0x002C2BA8]
Hemming would be proud of what you have accomplished here. All you have done for him.

Id: [0x002C2BA9]
Hemming would be proud of what you have accomplished here. All you have done for him.

This ache will pass, Trygve. With time.

This ache will pass, Trygve. With time.

Id: [0x002C2BBA]
Gunlodr?

Id: [0x002C2BBB]
Gunlodr?

Id: [0x002C2BBE]
Smashed crates. Somebody crawled off, left a trail of blood.

Id: [0x002C2BBF]
Smashed crates. Somebody crawled off, left a trail of blood.

There. Now give back the harp, so the musicians may play.

Id: [0x002C2BCA]
A brave try, but you have failed.

Id: [0x002C2BCB]
You have not yet learned the lesson, then?

Id: [0x002C2BD8]
[laugh]Do you hear this? Havi fears she will drink us dry!

Id: [0x002C2BD9]
Hunwald, dear. Look, it's Eivor.

Id: [0x002C2BDB]
I did. I should send a letter to Hunwald to give him the news. You know how he frets over me.

Id: [0x002C2BDD]
I pray he fares well. I adore the lad, but I worry the burden will be too great.

Id: [0x002C2BE1]
Swanburrow. You made it.

Id: [0x002C2BE2]
Swanburrow. You made it.

Id: [0x002C2BE5]
He should be fine. He has the heart of a leader. Now come, settle in. And enjoy your new home.

Id: [0x002C2BEA]
And you, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C2BED]
M-my first what?

Id: [0x002C2BEF]
Hunwald, Swanburrow. Good to see the both of you.

Id: [0x002C2BF0]
Hunwald, Swanburrow. Good to see the both of you.

That joy will last right up until your first blood-sacrifice.

Folly has consumed you.

Come you hither to pay your respects to the great and grave King Lerion?

Id: [0x002C2C18]
Darkness must reign. And you must fade within it!

Id: [0x002C2C1C]
Now you face the end!

Id: [0x002C2C1F]
Are you here for blood? Like all of those wretched others? Speak!

Id: [0x002C2C22]
Not for yours, unless you tempt me.

Id: [0x002C2C23]
Not for yours, unless you tempt me.

Suffer!

Bring out the blood! Bring out the dead! Feast on one more offering!

Long live the Daughters of Lerion!

Here I must take up the battle banner once again.

Id: [0x002C2CEE]
From the day you were born, I wanted nothing more than to pass on my title, my land, my people … to you.

Id: [0x002C2CEF]
Ours was the last kingdom in Norway to resist Harald's advance. To oppose him would have been our death.

Id: [0x002C2CF0]
…what choice did I have but to pledge my allegiance to him? A man with ambition and an army to match it.

Id: [0x002C2CF1]
Absent? I acted only as the son of a king must! To earn you riches! To bring you glory! To praise your name!

Id: [0x002C2CF2]
And spared me the shame of seeing my father debase himself like a gutted pig!

Id: [0x002C2CF3]
Y-you are right. I owed you the truth, and for that I am sorry. But I will not apologize for what I did.

Id: [0x002C2CF5]
You do not know that. We could have fought back.

Id: [0x002C2CF6]
We could have, yes. And suffered countless deaths for no other reason than to protect our pride.

Id: [0x002C2CF8]
You talk of kingship as if it were a matter of counting the notches on your axe. But to lead means so much more.

Id: [0x002C2CF9]
And that he uses your gaping mouth as a chamber pot.

Id: [0x002C2CFA]
I passed my crown to Harald because he was a man who understood the challenge put before him.

Id: [0x002C2CFC]
The people of Constantinople had no use for my name, Sigurd. I needed you here!

Id: [0x002C2CFD]
Unlike you…

Id: [0x002C2D01]
Plans change.

Id: [0x002C2D02]
As do hearts.

Id: [0x002C2D03]
Not this one.

Id: [0x002C2D04]
Sigurd! This is not why we came.

Id: [0x002C2D05]
Sigurd! This is not why we came.

Id: [0x002C2D06]
And you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002C2D07]
Eivor … why does it not surprise me to see you here.

Id: [0x002C2D09]
You said it yourself, his betrayal is worth a thousand deaths. I'm just waiting on a ship to take me to Rome.

Id: [0x002C2D0A]
Leofrith … following through with chasing down Burgred, I see.

Id: [0x002C2D0B]
Leofrith … following through with chasing down Burgred, I see.

Id: [0x002C2D0C]
I find it hard to believe you have a heart at all, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C2D0D]
Ever reckless, ever foolish, you could have been the one to guide my son to a better and wiser course.

Id: [0x002C2D0E]
But you could hardly control yourself. Always putting your own glory above the welfare of your clan.

Id: [0x002C2D0F]
You are leaking piss and vinegar, old man! Can you not smell your own bitterness?

Id: [0x002C2D11]
Coming here was a mistake.

Id: [0x002C2D13]
You'll give him my regards.

Id: [0x002C2D14]
You'll give him my regards.

Id: [0x002C2D16]
Then I have nothing left to say to you.

Id: [0x002C2D17]
Your father would have understood. He died to avoid a similar fate. To save his family, at the cost of his reputation.

Id: [0x002C2D19]
He loved you. That is all.

Id: [0x002C2D1C]
Argr nonsense! I've heard enough.

Id: [0x002C2D1D]
No. My father … he … he was…

Id: [0x002C2D1E]
No. My father … he … he was…

Id: [0x002C2D1F]
Gladly.

Id: [0x002C2D27]
A cart filled with oil jars? That could create quite a blaze.

Id: [0x002C2D29]
They've sent soldiers to stop our cart!

Id: [0x002C2D2A]
And you are the little fledgling prince of ravens, are you?

Id: [0x002C2D2B]
Yes, Varin, not even you will stand in my way!

Id: [0x002C2D2C]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C2D34]
It will.

Id: [0x002C2D39]
I know you love him, Eivor. I know you trust him. But do not follow him blindly into darkness or despair.

Id: [0x002C2D3F]
Father.

Id: [0x002C2D40]
Not my idea…

Id: [0x002C2D42]
Hmph.

Id: [0x002C2D44]
Listen to this weeping old goat!

Id: [0x002C2D47]
You pathetic worm.

Id: [0x002C2D4E]
Together, we will hammer these lumps of meat into men and women of iron. Into raiders.

Id: [0x002C2D59]
I am flattered you remember.

Id: [0x002C2D5C]
You are still raiding at your age?

Id: [0x002C2D5D]
You are still raiding at your age?

Id: [0x002C2D5E]
Sigurd…

Id: [0x002C2D60]
We will never know the truth because you were too afraid to risk it.

Id: [0x002C2D62]
Look after him, Eivor. And if you have the chance, lead him back from the edge of the abyss.

Id: [0x002C2D67]
He is my brother … not my dog.

Id: [0x002C2D68]
He is my brother … not my dog.

Id: [0x002C2D69]
Be well, old man. And serve your king with honor.

Vili!

[cough]O, thank you, Vili, thank you. I draw breath because of you.

Id: [0x002C2DA7]
You mean the council? Hjorr is on the council.

Id: [0x002C2DB0]
Now, to speak to the council members.

I do not want his counsel. All I have told you stays between the three of us.

Failure?

Very kind, thank you. I should like to see it.

I should look over the gift first. It must be worthy of Hemming Jarl.

Ah, drengr! If it's to join arms with me, the answer is yes. We can use someone like you against the Picts.

Id: [0x002C2E23]
Hah. If that is a challenge, I am up for it.

Id: [0x002C2E26]
I may be courted. But I am selective with whom I join. Are you a drinker?

Id: [0x002C2E40]
We're fine. Faravid and his karls escorted King Ricsige back to the Royal Hall. Everyone is safe.

Id: [0x002C2E43]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x002C2E44]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x002C2E51]
There you are, baptized as one of us.

A key. Where to?

A key. Where to?

The end of the trail. But where is the cauldron?

Id: [0x002C2EB7]
That would please me. You will find her in her grotto, up the path, within the circle of stones.

I will be discreet.

Only a feeble mind would call them honorable. They are privileged. Sedentary. Complacent. They wasted their resources.

Hemming was a hero, not for who he was, but for the people he led.

Id: [0x002C2F0C]
No need. These men are flies for swatting.

Id: [0x002C2F0E]
Ration your strength, Dag. We have an ocean to cross.

Id: [0x002C2F35]
All right, you lazy bacraut. Sigurd, what's our course?

Id: [0x002C2F36]
The Sons of Ragnar established a settlement near the coast. We set sail for that.

Id: [0x002C2F37]
Bragi! Sing a song to lift our hugr (spirits)!

Id: [0x002C2F39]
To rouse the gods! Inspire a mighty fart from Thor to speed us on our way!

Id: [0x002C2F55]
Should go and comfort him. All he's got to keep him company are his thoughts, and that daft girl, Geva.

Id: [0x002C2F6A]
And know that we are here for you, always, should you need us.

Id: [0x002C2F6B]
And know that we are here for you, always, should you need us.

Yes. The lucky man, I imagine he does.

Id: [0x002C2F73]
Aelfred? The line between friend and enemy is a porous one.

Id: [0x002C2F74]
My contact was none other than King Aelfred himself. The Order wanted him dead, so he fought back.

Id: [0x002C2F75]
My contact was none other than King Aelfred himself. The Order wanted him dead, so … he fought back.

On the backs of so many. Time will tell if it was worth it.

Id: [0x002C2F85]
Touch not that throne. It was blessed by a priest, as were the arrows.

Id: [0x002C2F88]
How dare you touch those sacred arrows! You've desecrated a martyr's place!

Id: [0x002C2F90]
When Father James blessed the late King Edmund, he blessed that holy throne and all upon it.

Id: [0x002C2F95]
That depends on your opinion of King Edmund. I wonder… I have studied those arrows, but never dared touch them.

Id: [0x002C2F96]
But since you plucked them anyway, would you sell them to me?

Id: [0x002C2F99]
More so now than ever.

Id: [0x002C2F9C]
I would pay heavy coin for them. I'm a sage, a chronicler of histories. Return to me if you desire riches.

Id: [0x002C2F9F]
The blessing did not take.

Id: [0x002C2FA0]
The blessing did not take.

Id: [0x002C2FA3]
If they are as you say, then I will keep them. They may prove of use, later.

Id: [0x002C2FA4]
If they are as you say, then I will keep them. They may prove of use, later.

Id: [0x002C2FA6]
I'm willing to sell, but the King Edmund arrows might be mixed up with my own.

Id: [0x002C2FA7]
I'm willing to sell, but the King Edmund arrows might be mixed up with my own.

Id: [0x002C2FA9]
I've the eye of an archivist, able to sort new from old. The kingdom's history shall be restored. Just sell them all to me.

Id: [0x002C2FAC]
What? When you so carelessly discarded those arrows, you discarded the history of this kingdom!

Id: [0x002C2FAD]
I'd love to, but I have no arrows.

Id: [0x002C2FAE]
I'd love to, but I have no arrows.

Id: [0x002C2FB0]
Take care of yourself, hm?

Id: [0x002C2FB1]
Take care of yourself, hm?

Id: [0x002C2FB3]
That I will do.

What you say is fair. Only watch over him. And if he should wreck himself in your care, that will be his burden to bear.

Id: [0x002C2FD4]
And new friends, I see.

Volva, I--

Id: [0x002C2FDF]
Volva, I--

I can show you. Follow, follow, follow.

And how do I find these camps?

Id: [0x002C2FE7]
And how do I find these camps?

Id: [0x002C2FEA]
[Exert ONO]Hey, hey! Careful with that one.

Id: [0x002C2FEB]
Your husband returns,[kiss ONO] bringing gifts and riches to share.

Id: [0x002C301B]
Eivor. My father sets forth on his final voyage.

Go, tell them the Abbess sent you, and bring the texts here at once.

Id: [0x002C303F]
Yes, Firebrand.

Id: [0x002C3042]
When every text is destroyed, it will mark the beginning of a new chapter. Just as The Firebrand says.

(unintelligible)[Eivor! What has become of Tewdwr? Did you find his body?]

Id: [0x002C32A3]
Good. And may the blessings of Freyja follow.

Id: [0x002C32A5]
Good. I will send word to Sigurd and the Ragnarssons, pledging your assistance.

Id: [0x002C32A7]
A good plan.

Id: [0x002C32A9]
I am relieved. He and Ivarr should be in Quatford just now. You will find it along the Afon Hafren River.

Id: [0x002C32AD]
Along the Great Ouse river that divides Oxenefordscire. Sigurd will be pleased to see you.

Id: [0x002C32AF]
Good. Be safe, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C32B1]
Protect your ears.

Id: [0x002C32B3]
Good. They will be pleased.

Id: [0x002C32B8]
Good. I will send word to our allies at once. Meet with Basim when you can. He should be in Croindene by now.

Id: [0x002C32BA]
Very generous of you. Make for the town of Glowecestre. You will find him there.

Id: [0x002C32BC]
An alliance in Essex would be invaluable. But go with caution.

Id: [0x002C32BE]
With caution, Eivor. Eurvicscire is currently at war with the Picts, a proud clan that lives just beyond the Roman wall.

Id: [0x002C32C0]
Good. I await your return.

Id: [0x002C32C2]
When entering a new city, it is best to ask around the ports. The people there know more than the average peasant.

Id: [0x002C32C4]
A passage from their holy book, I believe. Interesting. Go with care.

Id: [0x002C32C6]
I will. May the gods share in this, our final victory.

Id: [0x002C32C8]
He traveled to a town called Repton to meet Ubba and Ivarr Ragnarsson.

Id: [0x002C32C9]
As I hear it, they are on the verge of exiling the current King of Mercia, with the hope of installing a king of their own.

Id: [0x002C32CB]
I think you should.

Id: [0x002C32CF]
A force of Danes, called the Summer Army by the Saxons, is camped north of Grantebridge, at some ruins across the river.

Id: [0x002C32D0]
We should curry favor with their leaders, Guthrum and Soma, if we hope to win their trust and allegiance.

Id: [0x002C32D1]
My scouts did not meet them in person, so I can say little for the state of their army. Consider this a starting point.

Id: [0x002C32D3]
Yes. Dane invaders who serve a man called Rued. He seems to be sowing discord among Saxons and friendly Danes alike.

Id: [0x002C32D6]
But the kingdom has fallen into ruin since, with no king and violent raiders ravaging what little peace remains.

Id: [0x002C32D8]
I suggest you make for East Anglia and find out what their steward is doing wrong.

Id: [0x002C32DB]
He has, into a difficult situation. The shire has been mired in a long war with Rhodri, King of the Britons.

Id: [0x002C32DD]
Ceolbert hopes to negotiate a peace with the Britons of the west. A difficult task for one so green.

Id: [0x002C32DF]
Indeed. But I think it best if you supervise these talks. If Ceolbert can make this work, we will gain a valuable alliance.

Id: [0x002C32E1]
Ah, yes … Sigurd is there now, in fact. He bids you go meet him as soon as you can.

Id: [0x002C32E3]
He has partnered with a rebellious thegn called Geadric, and hopes to install Geadric as ealdorman in exchange for an oath.

Id: [0x002C32E7]
Basim has written, claiming to have found the woman Fulke and asking for your aid. He has taken shelter at Saint Hadrian's Priory.

Id: [0x002C32EA]
Nothing he mentioned. But if he has found the Paladin Fulke, Sigurd cannot be far behind.

Id: [0x002C32EC]
A rather boisterous man named Hunwald arrived recently, wishing to speak with you. On a matter of great importance, he said.

Id: [0x002C32EE]
Down at the docks, carousing with my scouts and scaring the fish from the river. He waits for you with great eagerness.

Id: [0x002C32EF]
I have received a unique summons from Snotinghamscire in the north. From your old friend, Vili.

Id: [0x002C32F1]
Well, it seems. Vili asks that you join him in feast and celebration, in honor of his father, Hemming Jarl.

Id: [0x002C32F2]
It is worth recalling that his father, Hemming Jarl, would be a formidable ally. Will you go?

Id: [0x002C32FA]
You may have noticed that Gunnar has disappeared from his forge. He has traveled to Glowecestrescire in search of a wife.

Id: [0x002C32FC]
He is in love.

Id: [0x002C32FE]
When doesn't this happen with our dear, lovelorn blacksmith? But there is a bright side. He has asked you to join him.

Id: [0x002C3304]
And see that he does not make a fool of himself. I believe he thinks that your presence would bolster his image.

Id: [0x002C3306]
We received a summons from the ealdorman and his Lady of Colcestre, requesting you specifically, for "a matter of great secrecy."

Id: [0x002C3308]
According to my scouts, he is a man who cares more for his own indulgences than the safety of his people. Approach with care.

Id: [0x002C330B]
Halfdan Ragnarsson, Conqueror of the North, sends his greeting. He wishes to meet with Eivor Wolf-Kissed personally.

Id: [0x002C330C]
He is currently entangled in a war with the Picts of the northern hills. I suspect he wants your council. Or your axe.

Id: [0x002C330E]
A wild city, one that Halfdan Ragnarsson tried to claim for himself, years ago. But it resists all attempts to be held.

Id: [0x002C3312]
In a city so chaotic, it is worth a try. Approach by the north gate, and start asking around.

Id: [0x002C3316]
If that is true, you are in luck. Our old friends Hjorr and Ljufvina have made their homes in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002C3319]
What say you then?

Id: [0x002C331D]
As a West Saxon stronghold, Wincestre will be a rather unwelcome place for you. But that is nothing you cannot handle.

Id: [0x002C331F]
If you go, do not go boldly.

Id: [0x002C3321]
And very heavily guarded. King Aelfred is preparing for war. You will meet tremendous resistance.

Id: [0x002C3323]
He is. He and Ubba have gathered a sizeable force and intend on launching an attack on Aelfred soon.

Id: [0x002C3325]
Rumor or not, I found someone willing to sail you there. She claims to have seen it once before.

Id: [0x002C3327]
Nessa is her name. Meet her at the docks when you are ready to leave.

Id: [0x002C3329]
It is a long voyage, Eivor. Be careful.

Id: [0x002C332D]
I have heard ill news about Styrbjorn in the past year. If you go, go with care.

Id: [0x002C332F]
Good. And be safe. Both of you.

Id: [0x002C3330]
I have changed my mind.

Id: [0x002C3331]

Id: [0x002C340F]
Stand down, Saxon! I mean you no harm!

Id: [0x002C3410]
Stand down, Saxon! I mean you no harm!

Id: [0x002C3417]
And then they will fling you into the pits of Hell, demon.

Id: [0x002C341A]
My God names you the Crow-Eyed Devil. And He sends out his angels to find you and kill you.

Id: [0x002C341C]
Tell me again. What did your god say about me?

Id: [0x002C341D]
Tell me again. What did your god say about me?

Cats are free spirits, aloof and haughty, like the goddess Freyja.

Another eel! Almost enough for a hearty soup.

Hello, Nali. You're settling in well enough. Now earn your keep.

Id: [0x002C3443]
Hello, Nali. You're settling in well enough. Now earn your keep.

Id: [0x002C3446]
Be careful. Herefrith may be more than he seems.

Id: [0x002C3448]
He has turned on his people. And what's more, Hytham has learned his true allegiance. The Order of the Ancients.

Id: [0x002C344A]
Indeed. And now Aelfgar asks that you return and right the wrong you brought to life. He is waiting near Anecastre with his fyrd (peasant army).

Id: [0x002C344D]
Will you go?

Id: [0x002C344E]
I must fight beside Aelfgar and make this right.

Id: [0x002C344F]

Tell me more about Lincolnscire. What has  become of their ealdorman, Herefrith?

Tell me more about Lincolnscire. What has  become of their ealdorman, Herefrith?

Id: [0x002C3636]
It's Ceolwulf's way of proving his loyalty. And there's no safer place for a traitor and his son than the middle of a pack of Danes.

Id: [0x002C3638]
The fyrds are with us, the common folk. But Burgred still has his soldiers all over Mercia.

Id: [0x002C3639]
They're devoted to him. And they'll die defending him.

Id: [0x002C363A]
What is Ceolwulf's son doing in Repton at all?

Id: [0x002C363B]
What is Ceolwulf's son doing in Repton at all?

Safe from who? You and Ivarr seem to have brought this shire to hell.

Safe from who? You and Ivarr seem to have brought this shire to hell.

Id: [0x002C363F]
Her mind is a jumble. She speaks to spirits. I fear her final winter has come. But she has me. Now let us speak to your needs.

Id: [0x002C3640]
Is your mother well?

Id: [0x002C3641]
Is your mother well?

Id: [0x002C3644]
A welcome invitation. It'll be good to see him again

Id: [0x002C3645]
A welcome invitation. It'll be good to see him again

Id: [0x002C3646]
If I were you, I would go by ship. Repton is quite a distance north on the river Trent.

Id: [0x002C364F]
If Ivarr is with him, I will certainly be needed.

Id: [0x002C3650]
If Ivarr is with him, I will certainly be needed.

Id: [0x002C3652]
There is an alehouse at the center of Buckingham. Sigurd will meet you there.

Id: [0x002C368B]
One of us had to stay in Jorvik. She wishes she could be here, but alas, our duties never rest.

Id: [0x002C368D]
Hjorr, old friend. It is good to see you here. Is Ljufvina here as well?

Id: [0x002C368E]
Hjorr, old friend. It is good to see you here. Is Ljufvina here as well?

Id: [0x002C368F]
Aye. Never. Only Hemming Jarl has that privilege now.

Id: [0x002C3690]
Aye. Never. Only Hemming Jarl has that privilege now.

Id: [0x002C369D]
You left me too soon, Hemming Jarl. Your shire's fate is uncertain.

Id: [0x002C369E]
You left me too soon, Hemming Jarl. Your shire's fate is uncertain.

Id: [0x002C369F]
And that is why my words should land true. Trust your judgment.

Id: [0x002C36A4]
Tales and songs are naught but wind and clamor. It's deeds that matter here.

Id: [0x002C36A6]
You can measure a warrior by the notches on his blade.

Id: [0x002C36A8]
Humble foes are thralls in waiting. Give me an enemy worth the swing of an axe!

Id: [0x002C36AA]
A feast is for meat and mead, not empty chatter.

Id: [0x002C36AC]
Suttungr is keen of mind, but he does not have our hearts. We need a warrior to lead us!

Id: [0x002C36C5]
None will say that Suttungr is less than generous.

Id: [0x002C36C7]
None will be capable.

Id: [0x002C36C8]
None will be capable.

Id: [0x002C36D8]
There must be a way to reach it.

Id: [0x002C36D9]

The mead is half gone. Then Aegir's cauldron can be drained!

Id: [0x002C36F4]
If there is another life beyond this, I hope it is a better one.

Id: [0x002C36FA]
Thralls. Humans kept in bondage, bred to serve. Such is the fate of the lowly.

Id: [0x002C36FB]
Thralls. Humans kept in bondage, bred to serve. Such is the fate of the lowly.

Id: [0x002C36FE]
I knew you wouldn't do it. Off you go and cry.

Id: [0x002C36FF]
Toil and drudgery is our lot.

Id: [0x002C3703]
Eivor, we do not have time to waste!

Id: [0x002C3705]
Do not go far. Our goal is further on!

Id: [0x002C3707]
Eivor, where are you going?

Id: [0x002C3708]
No sense trying to change fate. What counts is how you face it.

Id: [0x002C3709]
My father was a thrall, as is my wife, as will our children be.

Id: [0x002C3713]
I have found Tewdwr alive, and safe. I need to speak to Cyn--

Id: [0x002C3714]
I have found Tewdwr alive, and safe. I need to speak to Cyn--

Id: [0x002C3719]
The venerable King Rhodri is here. I am to deal with him directly.

Id: [0x002C371A]
I will be at your side when they do. Is there anything I should know first?

Id: [0x002C371B]
I will be at your side when they do. Is there anything I should know first?

Id: [0x002C3738]
Do you want the favor of the gods? Or protection from them?

Id: [0x002C3739]
Buy yourself some luck!

Id: [0x002C373A]
Live a charmed life!

Id: [0x002C373B]
Wealth withers, friends die … but these relics will last forever!

Id: [0x002C373E]
He's busy with the festival and shooed me away to Brigid. Would you like to see some magic I've been practicing?

Id: [0x002C3740]
Come on, let's go find him!

Id: [0x002C3744]
The Samhain Butcher? Never mind. Gwenydd. I'm looking for Cynon. Have you seen him?

Id: [0x002C3745]
The Samhain Butcher? Never mind. Gwenydd. I'm looking for Cynon. Have you seen him?

Id: [0x002C3748]
O, I shall! And I think I speak for the rest of us when I say this isn't over.

Id: [0x002C3754]
The Order made our paths intersect. I owed them a debt, and I repaid it by saving this city from its own destruction.

Id: [0x002C3759]
As always.

Id: [0x002C375A]
As always.

Id: [0x002C3771]
Have a care, though. You are safe in my presence, but you wander Utgard at your peril.

Id: [0x002C377A]
I will deal with that venomous trickster another day.

Id: [0x002C377B]
I will deal with that venomous trickster another day.

Id: [0x002C377C]
This land is quite beautiful. I had all but forgotten.

Id: [0x002C377F]
No stone walls will defend us when Ragnarok comes. All we have built here will be swept away.

Id: [0x002C3783]
Finally, the vault is open. The Mead awaits within.

Id: [0x002C3784]
Finally, the vault is open. The Mead awaits within.

Id: [0x002C3790]
Welcome, warrior. Sulke Silvertongue offers wonders from across the Nine Worlds! Rare objects! Priceless artifacts!

Id: [0x002C379C]
And yet you have put a price on them.

Id: [0x002C379D]
And yet you have put a price on them.

Sulke will stay within the city. He finds safety within its walls.

Id: [0x002C37B2]
For so long we made magics there in that tower. Enchantment has seeped into its very walls.

Id: [0x002C37B4]
The wind and snow have gnawed that tower to the bone. Soon we will knock it down.

Id: [0x002C37B6]
The vault, wherein our greatest discoveries are kept. Such things would do great harm in the hands of evil people.

Id: [0x002C37BD]
Thrym's helmet, bashed in by Mjolnir. Many Jotnar have been sent to their fate with a blow of Thor's hammer.

It is time to scout Rhodri's fortress. Are you ready?

Hej, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002C3828]
Hej, Ivarr.

Id: [0x002C382D]
It is ended, Ivarr. I am done with this place.

It is ended, Ivarr. I am done with this place.

Id: [0x002C3831]
When?

Odin may have use for you. But this is more than you deserve.

Odin may have use for you. But this is more than you deserve.

Id: [0x002C3842]
If this is one of them, my worries have vanished.

Id: [0x002C3843]
Eivor! Wolf-Kissed. You have come at just the right time. Ubba and Ivarr here are hunting a king.

Id: [0x002C384E]
That took longer than clearing this village.

Id: [0x002C3859]
We caught some eel for a feast. The bishop should be pleased.

Id: [0x002C385A]
This simple fellow comes now.

Id: [0x002C3870]
We have a forward camp just north of Tamworth. Will you go with us?

Id: [0x002C3871]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x002C3877]
If she takes a liking to you, keep talking.

Id: [0x002C3878]
No, no. This is your challenge.

Id: [0x002C3879]
She is more your type, I think.

Id: [0x002C387A]
She is more your type, I think.

I have come to warn you, old warrior. About a rot in your city. Three figures, corrupt and dangerous.

Id: [0x002C393C]
What a waste. No gold, no glory, nothing but rain, trees, and Gorm's lies.

Id: [0x002C393D]
I told you so.

Id: [0x002C3942]
I sense a twisted seidr on the air.

England? It is not what I expected.

This is … this is all so beautiful.

Id: [0x002C397D]
Ceolbert? What was he doing there-- Ivarr…

Too long a tale for now, but he's fine. I sent him to Repton. What's the plan here?

Id: [0x002C3984]
Too long a tale for now, but he's fine. I sent him to Repton. What's the plan here?

Id: [0x002C398F]
It won't be long before someone comes looking for these men. We need to get inside and find Aethelswith.

Id: [0x002C3994]
Only one way to find out.

Id: [0x002C3995]
Capture a queen to find a king … it might work.

Id: [0x002C3996]
Capture a queen to find a king … it might work.

Id: [0x002C3997]
See if you can get anything more out of them. Me and Eivor will take care of fetching Aethelswith.

Odin guide you.

Id: [0x002C39CF]
I will judge that!

Id: [0x002C39D0]
I will judge that!

Words will not stop me!

Words will not stop me!

Id: [0x002C39DA]
You are indeed.

Id: [0x002C39E3]
Eivor, that is … kind of you. I hope one day I can repay you.

Id: [0x002C39E8]
Your place is here! With me!

Id: [0x002C39E9]
Do not flee your destiny!

Id: [0x002C39EA]
Why do you flee from the truth!

Id: [0x002C39EB]
I will leave you here to die! Like a rotting fruit on a dying tree!

Id: [0x002C39EC]
You died once, you will again!

Id: [0x002C39EE]
(scream)

Id: [0x002C39EF]
Eivor! Stun him beneath the arms of the tree!

Id: [0x002C39F0]
Stun him within the circle!

Id: [0x002C39F2]
As will I.

Id: [0x002C39F6]
Eivor will handle it. Go on.

Id: [0x002C39F7]
What are we going to do about him?

Id: [0x002C39FB]
Go, I'll catch up.

Id: [0x002C39FC]
Go, I'll catch up.

Id: [0x002C39FD]
Couldn't have said it better myself.

Id: [0x002C39FF]
Come now, don't drag your feet.

Id: [0x002C3A3B]
I spoke with more people.

Id: [0x002C3A3C]
I spoke with more people.

Id: [0x002C3A3E]
I asked around as you suggested.

Id: [0x002C3A3F]
I asked around as you suggested.

Id: [0x002C3A91]
Hjorr … I was not aware we had company, the likes of which I did not approve.

Id: [0x002C3A93]
Forgive me, lord, this is--

Id: [0x002C3A98]
I am Faravid, war chief to Halfdan Ragnarsson. And this well-fed wastrel is Audun, High Reeve of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002C3A9A]
What do you want?

Id: [0x002C3A9C]
And they are growing, as you said.

Id: [0x002C3A9F]
Tell me what you know about the Red Hand, and I will rid your city of them. You can go about your affairs.

Id: [0x002C3AA0]
Tell me what you know about the Red Hand, and I will rid your city of them. You can go about your affairs.

Id: [0x002C3AA6]
Hjorr, perhaps for a lack of better judgment, deems it necessary that you interrupt. Why?

Id: [0x002C3ABD]
Hear me, friend. I have a haul of silver that will sink my ship. Can you help me spend it?

Id: [0x002C3ABE]
Hear me, friend. I have a haul of silver that will sink my ship. Can you help me spend it?

Id: [0x002C3AC1]
Keep it down, would you? You'll get yourself killed, flaunting like that, especially around here!

Id: [0x002C3AC5]
Ale dulls both mind and blade. What if the Aesir should attack right now?

Id: [0x002C3AC6]
Does anything bring you joy?

Id: [0x002C3EAD]
You know, you are not so repulsive when I'm drunk.

Id: [0x002C3EAE]
More mead here!

Id: [0x002C3EAF]
Two of my brothers died in the attack on Asgard. Now we throw a feast for Asgard's lord? Is Suttungr under a spell?

Id: [0x002C3EB0]
Patience. They cannot outlast us. You will have your chance at vengeance.

Id: [0x002C3EB1]
I will!

Id: [0x002C3EB6]
Must be some way I can wake this drunk.

Id: [0x002C3EB7]
Must be some way I can wake this drunk.

Id: [0x002C3EBF]
Ah, my brother. We parted. His road is unsure.

Id: [0x002C3EC0]
Ah, my brother. We parted. His road is unsure.

Id: [0x002C3EC4]
I have not seen him since we were together in Ledecestrescire. I am left uneasy when he is away.

Id: [0x002C3EC5]
I have not seen him since we were together in Ledecestrescire. I am left uneasy when he is away.

Id: [0x002C3EC6]
The feel of my opponent's skull giving way beneath my axe.

Id: [0x002C3EC7]
(sigh)

Id: [0x002C3EC8]
God will sear your soul, heathen! If He can find it.

Id: [0x002C3ECB]
I'll take them back to Tamworth. Get them talking.

Id: [0x002C3ED2]
As King Killer. They do not all get away like Burgred did, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002C3ED3]
Your legacy?

Id: [0x002C3ED4]
Your legacy?

Id: [0x002C3ED5]
I will inform Ceolwulf. He might have some ideas on how to get through to her.

Id: [0x002C3ED7]
We've got what we need. Let them go.

Id: [0x002C3ED9]
Sigurd … what about these prisoners?

Id: [0x002C3EDA]
Sigurd … what about these prisoners?

Id: [0x002C3EDD]
Quite the catch, Eivor. She is as much a poet as you.

This is why I fight so well.

Id: [0x002C3EE4]
Thank you…!

What has become of your preening brother?

Id: [0x002C3F23]
I will stay here with Ceolwulf. Go.

Id: [0x002C3F24]
Better than well. I am present.

Id: [0x002C3F27]
You are better off leaving that sauntering pole in your wake.

Id: [0x002C3F29]
My mother has found her peace at last. She walks through a world seen only in dreams, and will forevermore.

Id: [0x002C3F2A]
And … your mother?

Id: [0x002C3F2B]
And … your mother?

Id: [0x002C3F2D]
Indeed. Come.

Id: [0x002C3F2E]
That is all any of us can hope for.

How was your passage?

Id: [0x002C3F32]
How was your passage?

Id: [0x002C3F37]
Brigid! I found an abandoned bird's nest in the rafters. I'm going to take it home to Mother.

Id: [0x002C3F38]
(unintelligible)[If you leave it, then the babies will come back and lay their own eggs there, Gwen.]

Id: [0x002C3F39]
It's you again. The Samhain Butcher!

Id: [0x002C3F40]
Let's make short work of this, Eivor. England is a big place.

Id: [0x002C3F42]
Yes … yes. Forgive me, I … Do not harm me, I beg of you. Please. I'll go anywhere. Here! I resign it! Here!

Id: [0x002C3F43]
Take this lord and his wife to Rome. He is hereby exiled, never to return.

Id: [0x002C3F45]
Forward! Push forward!

Id: [0x002C3F47]
This is not going to end well.

Id: [0x002C3F48]
Just keep your wits about you.

Id: [0x002C3F4A]
We'll go see Tonna, just the two of us. Ivarr and Ubba will wait here. Better if Tonna thinks we've come alone.

Id: [0x002C3F4B]
Sigurd, is there a problem?

Id: [0x002C3F4C]
Sigurd, is there a problem?

Id: [0x002C3F4D]
You did better than your tight-lipped man here. He'll never say anything again.

Id: [0x002C3F4E]
Try not to drag the entire king's guard behind you.

Id: [0x002C3F53]
Eivor! Have you … have you been enjoying the festivities?

Id: [0x002C3F57]
They won't be without a leader. Modron will sit upon the horned throne.

Id: [0x002C3F58]
Cynon!

Id: [0x002C3F59]
Cynon!

Id: [0x002C3F5A]
We are done with this shadow play. Tewdwr is safe, and I know of your plan to sacrifice him in your stead.

Id: [0x002C3F5B]
We are done with this shadow play. Tewdwr is safe, and I know of your plan to sacrifice him in your stead.

Id: [0x002C3F5C]
Then what? Leave your people without a leader and an angry Church ready with holy fire?

Id: [0x002C3F5D]

Are you telling me that Modron lied?

Are you telling me that Modron lied?

Id: [0x002C3F60]
Ha! We've turned you in circles like a dog, haven't we? Modron was the architect of Tewdwr's murder, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C3F62]
There was no other way. She had a vision, Tewdwr framed by flames, and burning … everything we created together.

The witan recognizes King Ceolwulf of Mercia, second of his name. A just king. A merciful king. God save the king!

That's Hjorr's desk.

What a tale to weave into our saga. Look at us, side by side with the Ragnarssons.

Id: [0x002C3FB5]
Saxon blood feeds this land, and it is we Norse who march all over it!

Id: [0x002C3FB7]
Calm, Ivarr. Me and Eivor will take care of this.

Id: [0x002C3FB8]
I know.

Id: [0x002C3FBD]
The truth is, I don't think any of us can stop Ivarr from cleaving her head open. It's all he was spewing the whole way over here.

Id: [0x002C3FBF]
Right. Shall we?

Id: [0x002C3FC0]
Right. Shall we?

Id: [0x002C3FC3]
We'll return shortly.

Id: [0x002C3FC4]
A small fortune for whoever sends Tonna to Hel.

Id: [0x002C3FC7]
I'll hold you to that.

Id: [0x002C3FC8]
I'll hold you to that.

And if we can't?

Id: [0x002C3FCB]
And if we can't?

Id: [0x002C3FCC]
Ivarr did tell you to bring your axe.

Id: [0x002C3FCF]
We've told you everything. Won't you let us go?

Id: [0x002C3FD0]
That depends on what happens here.

Id: [0x002C3FD4]
Crawling with Saxon soldiers like lice on a swine. The very sight sours my blood.

Id: [0x002C3FD5]
Would the sight of their bodies in the mud please you better?

Id: [0x002C3FD6]
How does it look?

We squeezed them. Burgred's not here. It's his queen they're guarding, Aethelswith. They must have separated after Tamworth.

Id: [0x002C3FEC]
What's with the prisoners?

Id: [0x002C3FED]
What's with the prisoners?

Id: [0x002C3FF1]
We are warriors, all. And that is to the death.

Id: [0x002C3FF2]
Find anything yet?

Id: [0x002C3FF8]
And you are Eivor, the one who helped the Danes in Grantebridgescire. Destroyed poor Wigmund.

Id: [0x002C3FFB]
All I have are my weapons.

Id: [0x002C3FFC]
All I have are my weapons.

Id: [0x002C3FFD]
You have a stormy look.

Id: [0x002C4003]
We cannot unweave our fates, Eivor. All is laid before us, from the day we are born.

Id: [0x002C4004]
To be angry at this would be like … like wrestling the ocean. A pointless struggle.

Id: [0x002C4006]
Years ago, before we left for England, I saw a vision. A vision that foretold a betrayal. That I would betray you.

Id: [0x002C4012]
Prophecy?

Id: [0x002C4015]
You never told me this. And has your prophecy come to pass?

Right, of course. Okay … I'm ready.

Id: [0x002C403D]
Have I won?

Id: [0x002C403F]
No, no, I will be fine. And do not worry about me, worry about yourself!

You will have to fight me first. Maybe you want to sit back down.

Not every victory needs to be marked by the slaughter of a king.

Id: [0x002C407C]
Ah, but it is much better.

Id: [0x002C4081]
Mmm, ripe as a plum, aren't you? So eager…

Id: [0x002C4083]
Still looking.

Id: [0x002C4084]
Still looking.

Id: [0x002C4087]
She can't have gotten far. Look around.

Look, over there… Is that her?

Id: [0x002C4091]
Did you hear something? Keep an eye out.

Id: [0x002C40BA]
Before we begin, I would like to introduce our honored guests.

Id: [0x002C40D2]
Let it be said that I do wish you had more trust in me. But no. There are no ill feelings here.

Id: [0x002C40D7]
Ready the sea-beasts. Eivor Wolf-Kissed is here to escort us up river.

Id: [0x002C418D]
Eivor, this was among Ceolbert's possessions. I'm certain he would've wanted you to have it.

Id: [0x002C4191]
Eivor, there you are.

Id: [0x002C41EA]
Not far! We need to hurry!

You! You don't belong down here.

Id: [0x002C4380]
Shit … Go! We'll tend to the men here.

Id: [0x002C4386]
Ah! P-please!

Stay still.

Id: [0x002C4391]
(pained screaming)

No! No!

How can I help?

Id: [0x002C4395]
And I will be ready when you need me.

Id: [0x002C4396]
I will free you from this bond.

What are you doing? You're supposed to be in the market!

Id: [0x002C43EC]
We will go one by one, and if any of these peddlers gives you a hard time, remind them just who it is they work for.

O, with pleasure.

I have nothing left to trade, but Coppergate market is the right place. Ask around, you'll find someone who will bend an ear.

This is taking too long.

No word from Gorm. And he has taken all the ale. So much work for so little reward!

Hilde, yes, Hilde. But she does not worry about Olav's happiness. She worries only about Gorm's anger.

I should tell you, Olav … your sister is looking for you.

Id: [0x002C4693]
I should tell you, Olav … your sister is looking for you.

No, no! The cave is my safe place. Safe from Gorm and his anger. Safe from the talking crystal.

How did you come here, Olav? Are you a prisoner here?

Id: [0x002C46C8]
How did you come here, Olav? Are you a prisoner here?

Id: [0x002C46CA]

Olav, tell me about your falling out with Gorm.

You! You look stronger than most of the others. What's your name?

That is not our plan. Too many wild folk in the woods.

Id: [0x002C47CB]
You ask too many questions, Horse. Your task is to keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you. Now unload that ship and--

Haul what supplies we have to the nearest camps, then. Gorm's men will do the rest.

O, good. Yes, yes. Honor is good. Olav will help you. Olav will help you so much.

It is a matter of honor, and Gorm owes me a great debt. Let us leave it at that.

O yes, yes! Olav is helpful. Olav helps in your nameless feud. Olav obeys!

Id: [0x002C481E]
My reasons matter not. Will you help me find him or no?

Id: [0x002C481F]
My reasons matter not. Will you help me find him or no?

Id: [0x002C4821]
No, no! Olav makes talk only. Olav has no one to talk to.

Id: [0x002C4823]
I have hidden myself away, to wait for now, and think of riddles no one will hear.

Hey!

The brave men slain, Valkyrjur wakes…

Reward for strain to Valholl takes!

Then horns resounds the mighty hall!

Id: [0x002C4852]
Ready yourselves, men! Ah!

Id: [0x002C4855]
Nine, large and fat. Fed us for a week. Yeah?

Id: [0x002C4857]
For me, home is family. But I have no family.

Not while Gorm is about, no, no. Not while he wants my head. I must stay here where it is safe.

I spent a season in their Kingdom of Mercia. A temperate land. Lush and wild. By now, the Sons of Ragnar will have claimed its heart.

Id: [0x002C4B0C]

As much as it pains me to say, I suspect something foul at the rectory. I have heard whispering, collusion.

Id: [0x002C4B44]
Abbess Ingeborg, this is Eivor, our honored guest from the south. Eivor has offered to help rid Jorvik of the Red Hand.

It is not his heart that's stirring…

Eivor, you giant steaming bowl of elk piss! [laugh]King Oswald sends his regards.

But The Order, they took notice of me. Saw that it was courage that drove me.

But that door was always shut to me. My methods deemed too severe. I was cast out, shunned, scorned …

Id: [0x002C4E94]
Shame. I could do with a cup. But alas, this feast is the talk of the town. I am eager for it! Good man, that Audun.

Hjorr would never wrong the people like that, even if Ricsige demanded it. The dockmaster is a thief and a liar.

Alrekstad has a nicer feel. More lived in, more built up.

Id: [0x002C4F5D]
Ah, it's not that bad here. You could have been sent north, beyond the white-fang.

Id: [0x002C4F5E]
Bunch of ungrateful narwals living here, that is how I see them. Look harmless but would stab you in a second.

Id: [0x002C4F5F]
Have patience. It's a new way to live under King Harald.

Id: [0x002C4F69]
Could you give it to me again?

Id: [0x002C4F6A]
Could you give it to me again?

Id: [0x002C4F6B]
I think I will need to hear that again.

Id: [0x002C4F6C]
I think I will need to hear that again.

Id: [0x002C4F6D]
One more time?

Id: [0x002C4F6E]
One more time?

Id: [0x002C4FAF]
One last thing. We'll need a fyrd before our battle's done. Try to free any captives you find. They'll swell our ranks.

Id: [0x002C4FD5]
Then let fate guide our journey. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002C4FD6]
As is the promise of glory. But the act of leaving so beloved a home, there is a sadness to it.

Id: [0x002C4FD7]

Id: [0x002C4FD8]
No. Not at all. The die is cast.

Id: [0x002C4FD9]
No. Not at all. The die is cast.

Id: [0x002C4FDA]
Thank you, Holger. And please, do not let this blunt our friendship. I did not mean for this to escalate.

Id: [0x002C4FDF]
That we could use their skills as we get settled. Having access to trade and someone to tend our mounts would be a boon.

Id: [0x002C4FE0]
That we could use their skills as we get settled. Having access to trade and someone to tend our mounts would be a boon.

Id: [0x002C4FE8]
Scarcely arrived and now we must raid?

Id: [0x002C4FE9]
We cannot master this land merely by asking.

Id: [0x002C4FEB]
O, it's no bother. Better I forge axes than swing them. My place is here, not pulling on the oar of a river-horse.

Id: [0x002C4FED]
I may be the jarl of this clan, but you and I lead together. As ever.

Id: [0x002C4FF1]
So get acquainted with your room. And when you are ready, meet me at the stables.

Id: [0x002C5006]
And so you have returned, Eivor Raven-Feeder. But we have nothing left to say.

Id: [0x002C5007]
Modron.

Id: [0x002C5008]
Modron.

Id: [0x002C501C]
Someone is hiding in there. Doubt he will come out. I will have to find a way in.

Id: [0x002C50C7]
Uh! Get away!

Id: [0x002C50C9]
Stop!

Id: [0x002C50CA]
Stop!

Id: [0x002C50DE]
Kill anyone who tries to escape!

Id: [0x002C50E5]
One step closer.

Id: [0x002C50E6]
One step closer.

Id: [0x002C50F3]
Eivor! Over here!

Id: [0x002C5106]
Synin, you made us some friends.

Id: [0x002C5107]
Synin, you made us some friends.

Id: [0x002C5119]
A shrine, and well cared-for, at that. His loss is deep.

Id: [0x002C511A]
A shrine, and well cared-for, at that. His loss is deep.

Id: [0x002C5139]
Reckless stripling! I warned you the risk was too great!

Id: [0x002C513A]
Peace, Guthrum. It is Fulke who merits your wrath, not Eivor.

Id: [0x002C5158]
Go, then. But know you leave me in a time of need.

Id: [0x002C5159]
Go, then. But know you leave me in a time of need.

When you find the nightshade, bring it to me beneath the gallows tree south of Beodoricsworth.

He landed on these shores some time ago.

A mixing bowl for making berserker brew. Smells of piss and nightshade.

Id: [0x002C51C8]
As you wish, Brother.

Id: [0x002C51CD]
Purpose? What purpose?

Id: [0x002C51CF]
Jora is no more. My name is Eivor, a drengr of the Raven Clan. And my purpose is fulfilled.

Gorm is dead! The troll is dead!

Id: [0x002C51E7]
Olav?

Id: [0x002C51E9]
I am well, yes. O so well. And I may stay! To linger, one season or two, with the friends I have made.

Id: [0x002C51ED]
Take care of yourself, Olav, in this life and the next.

Id: [0x002C51EE]
Take care of yourself, Olav, in this life and the next.

Let's regroup there.

Let's regroup there.

Id: [0x002C5224]
Of course it has. Why would I expect differently? I'll have my men dump it.

Id: [0x002C5231]
Of course.

Id: [0x002C525C]
One way to find out.

Id: [0x002C5260]
To fight beside such legends is an honor. I've only heard tales of your conquests. Now I get to live them.

Outdid myself again. Ugh. Did I miss the crowning?

What business have you?[beat] O, the Mari Lwyd. Right, right, we're doing cakes instead of beer this year.

Id: [0x002C528B]
Samhain night and the moon is high, Mari Lwyd haunts my door…

Id: [0x002C528F]
Haha! Here, then. Sweets for the Mari Lwyd, you've earned it.

Id: [0x002C5293]
Ooh, ghosts and beasties. Here, spirit, take your reward.

Id: [0x002C529E]
Brigid. Something terrible has happened. Cynon's men are after me. I've got to find Modron.

[ONO_Exert]Go! Now!

Id: [0x002C52A4]
Go! Now!

Id: [0x002C52A8]
O! Thank the gods. We've been waiting for children all night to empty our stores so we can go to the party. Have some extra.

Id: [0x002C52AB]
Ah!

Id: [0x002C52AC]
Momma!

Id: [0x002C52AD]
Sigurd!

Id: [0x002C52B0]
Sigurd, take the horse.

Id: [0x002C52B2]
No, no, Varin! No Varin!

Id: [0x002C52B3]
Pick up your axe.

Id: [0x002C52B5]
Ah!

Id: [0x002C52B7]

Give me sweets, and candied treats, the kind I most adore.

Id: [0x002C52D9]
Follow me. I'll give you the tour.

Id: [0x002C52DB]
Are you playing the role of trickster spirit?

Id: [0x002C52DD]
All it takes is a mask and some sweetcakes to turn you into a gentle skald.

Id: [0x002C52DF]
Eivor, mighty warrior, knocker of doors, victor of cakes. How does it feel to pillage what is freely given?

Id: [0x002C52E1]
Can trickster spirits see? The eyeholes in this mask are terrible.

A worthy haul. And a tradition worth keeping up!

Id: [0x002C52E6]
A worthy haul. And a tradition worth keeping up!

Id: [0x002C5308]
Blood of Tengri! Riders of Bjarmia!

Id: [0x002C530B]
More of them, just there.

Id: [0x002C530F]
Keep your head down.

Id: [0x002C5310]
Keep your head down.

Id: [0x002C5311]
I think it is safe now. Gods, Eivor, your arrival could not be better timed.

Id: [0x002C533B]
And the bishop … he has been sneaking around the rectory, often visiting the priests in the cover of night.

Id: [0x002C533F]
The skalds say Odin hung himself on a tree much like this.

Berserker brew hits hard. It may open your eyes to the spirit realm. It may turn you into a savage beast.

Gods. Never have I seen such a place.

Id: [0x002C538F]

Just who do you think you are, trespassing like this! This is my property you've destroyed!

Id: [0x002C53B6]
Gone to his quarters. Said he would return once he finished tending to a private matter. But that was some time ago.

Id: [0x002C53BB]
I am looking for the bishop. Where is he?

Id: [0x002C53BC]
I am looking for the bishop. Where is he?

Id: [0x002C53C4]
You. My blood enemy.

Make sure it never leaves the island.

Make sure it never leaves the island.

You're safe with me.

Would that I had now what I had yesterday. Find out what that was.

Mankind it mars, speech it hinders, yet speech it will inspire.

Here is the stone circle, but no way into the sanctum. Another illusion!

No, I need you here. Listen to the voices in this hall.

No, I need you here. Listen to the voices in this hall.

Id: [0x002C5435]
Brave soldiers! My name is Stowe, Reeve of Lunden, and this Dane at my side is Reeve Erke.

Id: [0x002C5438]
He is my partner in Lunden. Together we see that justice is done. But more, he is my friend.

Id: [0x002C543A]
In Lunden, we live in harmony with the Danes. So could you. But your king does not share our philosophy.

Id: [0x002C543C]
So I beg you, in God's name, walk away from this camp. I will find you new and worthy employment in Lunden.

Id: [0x002C543E]
This one's right. The Danes are here to stay, like it or not. What good's dying now?

Id: [0x002C543F]
Don't be a lackwit! Soon as you drop your swords, they'll murder us!

Id: [0x002C5440]
That's no heathen talking. He's a Saxon. I, for one, believe him.

Id: [0x002C5442]
We'll deal with you traitors later. The rest of you, attack!

Id: [0x002C5454]
Njal is tired. I will tend to her beneath the tree where this all began.

Id: [0x002C5457]
What is it?

Id: [0x002C5458]
What is it?

Id: [0x002C547C]
Hog's golden bristles, Frode, how did I let you talk me into this?

Id: [0x002C547D]
Stop clucking like a laying hen. I'm the one with the broken leg. At least grab Old Hisser's tale while you're up there!

Id: [0x002C5480]
Something is hissing. Jormungandr's fangs, are there snakes up here too?

Id: [0x002C5483]
Alright, alright. Well, you'll have to get down somehow. Can you see a haystack or something?

Id: [0x002C5485]
My brother. Chasing some foolish legend that if you see Old Hisser from above and catch his tail, he will grant you a wish.

Id: [0x002C5487]
Someone is stuck?

Id: [0x002C5488]
Someone is stuck?

Id: [0x002C548D]
I'll help you down, but how is a big, strong Norse like yourself afraid of heights!

Id: [0x002C548E]
I'll help you down, but how is a big, strong Norse like yourself afraid of heights!

Id: [0x002C548F]
It's too high to get down from here!

Id: [0x002C5490]
Which way now?

Id: [0x002C5491]
Yes! I'm alive! Brother!

Id: [0x002C54AA]
You're welcome… but what is the story you spoke of? Old Hisser?

Id: [0x002C54AB]
You're welcome… but what is the story you spoke of? Old Hisser?

Id: [0x002C54B0]
I need nothing from you.

Id: [0x002C54B1]
I need nothing from you.

Id: [0x002C54BE]
We are all in the dark, Eivor. It is the search for the light that brings us closer to the gods.

Id: [0x002C54BF]
You cower from me, Fulke? Like a rat in the dark?

Id: [0x002C54C0]

Sigurd is an Ancient One! An archon, Nephilim, Isu, call him what you will. He is reborn!

Id: [0x002C54C4]
He is everything we should hope to be!

Id: [0x002C54C5]
He is my brother and my jarl. And you are mind-sick.

Id: [0x002C54C6]

Eivor! There you are.

Id: [0x002C5528]
Ah! A wicker man speaks! Now let them speak in chorus!

Id: [0x002C553B]
Fitting name for scavengers! Winged rats taking what isn't yours!

Id: [0x002C553C]
So long as you don't leave my things behind.

Id: [0x002C553D]
Hm … every hour we traveled, I tried to conjure in my mind some vision of this place.

Id: [0x002C553E]
I saw the trees and the water and the rolling hill. But I could not foresee so much … green!

Id: [0x002C553F]
It is a rare feeling to travel across the sea and still find oneself at home. This place feels powerful. Alive.

Id: [0x002C5541]
All these people you have brought here, this life you have built on these stranger shores. Does it please you?

Id: [0x002C5543]
Tell me about your visions.

Id: [0x002C5547]
Do you foresee great things for us?

Id: [0x002C5548]
Do you foresee great things for us?

Id: [0x002C554D]
Valka! Gods above, what brings you? Hope there isn't a curse on the settlement or some such.

Id: [0x002C554E]
Ha! The only curse on this place is their great lout of a blacksmith.

Id: [0x002C5555]
Keep on! The honor of Glowcestre is at stake. I will not leave these lands to one who laps at ale like a cat!

Id: [0x002C5578]
If you be mortal, I will not speak to you. I am waiting for the spirit, they come, they come.

Id: [0x002C557E]
Whatever you are, the spirits of straw have burst into flames as herald of your arrival. Come… Come this way.

Id: [0x002C559D]
Hamu-ram … hamu-ram…

Id: [0x002C559F]
Hush. I need silence to hear the songs of nature.

Hamu-ram … hamu-ram…

Come.

I … I have come for your advice. On a private matter.

Id: [0x002C55AD]
I … I have come for your advice. On a private matter.

Id: [0x002C55B5]
Ah! The High One! He calls to you. Perhaps he means to speak with you. Deliver a message.

Id: [0x002C55B7]
There was a wolf, howling and fierce. And then a figure. A graybeard in a cloak with a single eye. He bid me follow him.

No!

No!

Hush, Dag. Or would you steer us into a storm, even as the seas are calm?

I will talk with Randvi about your idea. Get her thoughts.

I will talk with Randvi about your idea. Get her thoughts.

Id: [0x002C5623]
O yes. By fierce men. Warriors who attack any stranger on sight. Any one!

Id: [0x002C5624]
And they are all well-armed. Not like you! As well-equipped as a stable hand.

Id: [0x002C5628]
Olav will help. Gather ore and hides to barter for war gear.

Id: [0x002C562A]
Yes yes! Some in the woods. Much more at Gorm's camps. Then trade it all with the people here. Easy as a smile, yes, yes.

Id: [0x002C563A]
It does not take much to kill a man.

You are not wrong. I could use better weapons.

Ore and hides, I can find out there?

Id: [0x002C5649]
This morning we traded with a ship passing south. They told us Eivor the Wolf-Kissed was captured by Kjotve's men.

Id: [0x002C564D]
Look! Out across the river. One of Gorm's camps. All look like that. All of them.

Id: [0x002C565F]
Thank you for this, Olav. And until I say otherwise, speak nothing of this to anyone.

Id: [0x002C5660]
Thank you for this, Olav. And until I say otherwise, speak nothing of this to anyone.

Id: [0x002C5667]
Ah, Father…

Id: [0x002C5668]
Tonight we feast and celebrate your return, Sigurd. The tables are laid with barley and lamb, bread and mead--

Id: [0x002C5669]
And no more, I beg you. I want nothing you would not serve a thrall (slave). Let me be the one to honor you.

Id: [0x002C566A]
I bring gifts and tales from faraway lands. After two winters away, I am full up with both.

Id: [0x002C566B]
Very well, very well. Come inside.

Id: [0x002C566E]
He has dogged us too long. Shamed us for too many seasons. I know this. Eivor knows this…

Id: [0x002C5670]
It ends now.

Id: [0x002C567D]
Look around! Search every room! They are around here somewhere.

Id: [0x002C567E]
My eyes cannot forget the sight, Njal. Her hair so long and falling down.

Id: [0x002C5684]
The Red Hand. I need to leave.

Id: [0x002C5685]
The Red Hand. I need to leave.

The target sent the Red Hand after me. I must be closing in.

How are you called, you bear-skins, you wolf-shirts, you tasters of blood?

Id: [0x002C5698]
What do you fight for, you bear-skins?

Id: [0x002C5699]
What do you fight for, you bear-skins?

Id: [0x002C569B]
We are the shield-biters, wall-breakers, born in battle's flood!

Id: [0x002C56A0]
The bishop's quarters. What is that burning smell?

Id: [0x002C56A3]
Lord above! Th-the bishop! N-no, I can't look. O, dear Lord…

Id: [0x002C56B1]
But you live still! Can you feel the power of bear's blood coursing through your veins?

Id: [0x002C56B3]
Show yourself, cowards!

Id: [0x002C56CA]
The skalds say Bjorn carried you into battle when you were but a bear cub. Raised you as one would raise a child.

You killed her! My Alfhild! Why?

Id: [0x002C56EB]
With each day we wait, Kjotve grows stronger.

Id: [0x002C56EC]
I speak as your king, Sigurd. Not your father. Heed my warnings or be off!

Id: [0x002C56F0]
Whatever you be, now you are here the ritual may begin! [beat]But the men of straw must announce you with sparks!

Id: [0x002C56F6]
Where is he? Where is Sigurd?

Id: [0x002C56FE]
A twisted path. No clear way forward.

Id: [0x002C5715]
We do not have the men to storm Kjotve's fortress. The losses would ruin us!

Id: [0x002C5716]
The losses have ruined us, Father! Until we cut off this serpent's head, it will poison us, day by day, drop by drop!

Id: [0x002C5719]
Do not lead my son into the same storm that follows you.

Id: [0x002C5725]
Please! My family, they've died unjustly. They need to be burned! But this fire won't do.

Id: [0x002C572A]
Oil jars for the fire. This should be enough.

Id: [0x002C572B]
Oil jars for the fire. This should be enough.

Id: [0x002C574A]
Come, settle your mind and tell me what you have seen.

Dag, you old hound! You live!

Id: [0x002C5753]
Dag, you old hound! You live!

Id: [0x002C575E]
But what form of being are you beneath this guise of horse and bone? From the realm of the fae? I know you cannot say. I press no more.

Id: [0x002C5760]
But if you wish to be my first sacrifice, Odin will be more than happy to receive you.

Id: [0x002C5769]
Hail, Raven Clan! You reap a bloody harvest.

Id: [0x002C576A]
I did indeed. I am Guthorm, uncle to King Harald of the North. I speak for my nephew when there is need.

Id: [0x002C576B]
This is not King Harald's land. Why does he send warriors so far south?

Id: [0x002C576D]
Let there be cacophony! One more, one more.

Id: [0x002C5777]
Yes, of course. When the time is right.

Id: [0x002C5786]
This chain is huge. And poorly anchored, it appears. I might be able to shoot it.

Id: [0x002C5787]
This chain is huge. And poorly anchored, it appears. I might be able to shoot it.

Id: [0x002C5788]
Done. The path is clear.

Id: [0x002C5789]
Done. The path is clear.

Men like you deserve something worse than death. I hope your family condemns you, even in Helheim.

I have-- I have-- Cakes. Mummy made. Here!

Id: [0x002C57CC]
Had Sigurd spent his last two winters here in Fornburg, defending our lands, we might have been rid of Kjotve by now.

Id: [0x002C57CF]
I do. But it will fall to you and Sigurd to accept it. And I must have your word that you will.

Id: [0x002C57D1]
Hmm. We shall see.

Id: [0x002C57D2]
You talk like a man with one foot in Helheim.

Id: [0x002C57D3]
You talk like a man with one foot in Helheim.

Id: [0x002C57D4]
Have you no plan of your own to rid this land of our enemy? Will it fall to Sigurd and me?

Have you no plan of your own to rid this land of our enemy? Or will it fall to Sigurd and me?

Brilliant, that is!

Ah, have a cake for your troubles, then.

Id: [0x002C5875]
Thor's Hammer … that was a shock.

Id: [0x002C5876]
Thor's Hammer … that was a shock.

Id: [0x002C5878]
Yes, and you are Eivor?

Id: [0x002C587A]
A noble one, a cause as true as the world is old. But let us leave it at that for now.

Id: [0x002C587D]
I am. I hope this ruckus does not overwhelm you. We tend to drink and talk at equal speed.

Id: [0x002C587E]
I am. I hope this ruckus does not overwhelm you. We tend to drink and talk at equal speed.

Id: [0x002C587F]
Sigurd spoke often of you on our journey. Called you his right arm, a celebrated warrior. I am honored to meet you.

Id: [0x002C58BF]
I've heard much of you, young one. They say you're something. We'll see.

Id: [0x002C58C0]
Eivor hopes to rescue Sigurd from the madwoman Fulke, now ensconced in Portcestre fortress.

Id: [0x002C58C1]
You promised a great army, but you couldn't breach a crone's garden with what you have assembled here.

Id: [0x002C58D3]
What you need is to swallow your pride, Raven-Feeder. Listen to wiser heads than yours.

Id: [0x002C58D4]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002C58D8]
I will hear you, Guthrum Saxon-bane, if you wish to speak your piece.

Id: [0x002C58D9]
I will hear you, Guthrum Saxon-bane, if you wish to speak your piece.

Eivor, this mess is of your making!

Id: [0x002C58E7]
That's the way, Eivor! For glory, and for Odin!

Id: [0x002C58E9]
We kill them here, or behind the walls of Portcestre. Either way they die.

Attackers from the river! They look to be Danes!

Id: [0x002C58EE]
Too many! Now come! The battle roars already!

Id: [0x002C58F0]
Bloody curs! What quarrel have Danes with us?

Id: [0x002C58FB]
Danes? How many?

Danes? How many?

A lion's heart and a crow's cunning. Guthrum judged you too swiftly.

We have work to do. Let's be about it.

Good to hear. We have need of his courage.

Good to hear. We have need of his courage.

Id: [0x002C5958]
We know the Sons of Ragnar have camped in the North. It would do us well to pay them a visit to strengthen our ties to this land.

Id: [0x002C5959]
Is that where Basim has gone?

Id: [0x002C595A]
Is that where Basim has gone?

Id: [0x002C595D]
Not yet. First speak with Randvi. She has more than one task for you here.

Id: [0x002C595E]
Then I must join you, Sigurd. For I am a fitter companion on long roads.

Id: [0x002C595F]
No, Dag, you belong here with the raiders. And you will act as Eivor commands.

Id: [0x002C5963]
Yes! And I will keep our raiders sharp.

Id: [0x002C5964]
Ride in safety, Brother. I will follow as soon as I can.

Id: [0x002C5965]
Ride in safety, Brother. I will follow as soon as I can.

Id: [0x002C5973]
[scoff]Do as Eivor commands? Is he testing me?

Id: [0x002C5975]
I would sooner take orders from a louse.

Id: [0x002C5976]
He may be. Sigurd is a wise man.

Id: [0x002C5977]
He may be. Sigurd is a wise man.

Dear God, Basim will have my head for this.

A gift I give myself. I see that now. Thank you for showing me the way.

You'll find somewhere safe?

Prepare yourself for a journey, into another time, another plane.

Id: [0x002C59E7]
Have you found yourself? If you are a spirit of light, answer me this…

Id: [0x002C59E9]
Threefold Death is the charm!

Id: [0x002C59EA]
Yes! Such that a wedded pair can sup broth together.

Id: [0x002C59EB]
In such fashion, I speak to druids long dead. But of course you, a spirit, would know that.

Id: [0x002C59EC]
Sabrina the water nymph! Yes.

Id: [0x002C59ED]
A secure knot indeed. Only one of light need not fear it.

Id: [0x002C59EE]
The upturned blade! Things can be reversed! You know this charm.

Id: [0x002C59F1]
And the effects of that draught still cling.

He set down in Constantinople some months ago, to rest and resupply he told me. But I knew otherwise.

Id: [0x002C59F9]
Men with eyes that gleam like his are always up to something more. I think he wished to raid the Hagia Sophia.

Id: [0x002C59FA]
I will not bore you with the details of our meeting, but I liked your brother from the first.

Id: [0x002C59FC]
I saw something in him that captivated me. As if a forgotten memory of an old friendship had suddenly resurfaced.

Id: [0x002C59FD]
Likewise, Basim. And how did you come to meet my brother?

Id: [0x002C59FE]
Likewise, Basim. And how did you come to meet my brother?

Id: [0x002C5A05]
Yes. [beat]But now I fear I must ask you one last thing, should you be willing.

Id: [0x002C5A0E]
Now both are gone, yet I remain.

Id: [0x002C5A17]
We strive for fame, and glory, and good deeds. Naught else can we do.

I did not mean to fail you, Guthrum Jarl. It was only for a moment. I was so tired.

Id: [0x002C5A3E]
As are we all, boy. We marched hard to get here.

Id: [0x002C5A40]
Still, let's not disappoint me again. You hear?

Id: [0x002C5A42]
You must be Eivor.

Id: [0x002C5A5A]
I understand. May Freyja watch your way, Broder. Until we meet again.

Seer, please. We'll die without blood-mead.

Id: [0x002C5A6B]
I know not! But without her draughts, my family is doomed.

What troubles you, friend? Why won't the seer answer your call?

Id: [0x002C5AAB]
I'll tell you later. It's been a … a trip.

Id: [0x002C5AAE]
That's quite nice. Soothing.

(unintelligible)[Please go get Tewdwr fast. My wedding depends on his rescue.]

Id: [0x002C5AD4]
Curse it! Curse it! Curse it! Curse the day I was born!

Id: [0x002C5AD6]
There, you see? This is what waiting brings. We must answer this insult!

Id: [0x002C5AD8]
We hit him there. Burn it down, before Kjotve learns his spies are dead.

Id: [0x002C5ADA]
I have not been bred for Valhalla like you, but this will be far from my first battle.

Id: [0x002C5ADB]
I do not like this, but I will not stop you.

Id: [0x002C5ADC]
They came from Nottfall, that whaling village under Kjotve's control.

Id: [0x002C5ADD]

He may have sent more. I can search the village while you round up the crew.

Id: [0x002C5ADF]
He may have sent more. I can search the village while you round up the crew.

Id: [0x002C5AE0]
We? Do you mean to join us?

Id: [0x002C5AE1]
We? Do you mean to join us?

Id: [0x002C5B1C]
That sounds right.

Id: [0x002C5B1D]
That sounds right.

Id: [0x002C5B20]
He has that effect on people. Enjoy your evening, Basim.

Id: [0x002C5B26]
Tewdwr, get to safety!

Id: [0x002C5B27]
Tewdwr, get to safety!

Id: [0x002C5B2E]
Eivor! Thank you … for saving my life.

Id: [0x002C5B30]
Good to meet you as well.

Id: [0x002C5B31]
Good to meet you as well.

Id: [0x002C5B33]
You have my thanks, kind one.

Id: [0x002C5B41]
Good, you know of it. From my pain, life springs. [groan]Please, help me to the clearing. The field needs the blood-mead.

Id: [0x002C5B46]
Blood-mead.

Id: [0x002C5B47]
Blood-mead.

Id: [0x002C5B48]
It is no wound, but the blood is mine. I made the potion, Freyja's Blessing, to help the crops grow.

Id: [0x002C5B57]
It is good to have you back, Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C5B58]
It is good to have you back, Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C5B5C]
…I gift one of these secrets to you. A weapon, for the finest warrior I know.

Id: [0x002C5B5D]
Eivor! Thought I smelt you on the wind!

Id: [0x002C5B5E]
Seer, my crops wither, and my family starves. Harvest comes soon, yet our fields remain barren.

Id: [0x002C5B5F]
I know your land suffers, Rada. Take the rest of my blood-mead, and water your soil. All will be well in a few days.

Id: [0x002C5B60]
Thank you, blessed seer! I will see to my fields at once. Thank you.

Id: [0x002C5B7C]
Mentor, I must protest. This is deeply unorthodox. Our wrist-blade is a sacred tool--

Id: [0x002C5B7D]
Do not make a fetish out of cold metal, Hytham. What matters is the mind of the one who wields it.

Id: [0x002C5B80]
Am I not worthy of this gift?

Id: [0x002C5B81]
Am I not worthy of this gift?

Id: [0x002C5B87]
You may ask him yourself. My lord?

Id: [0x002C5B89]
Thank you, Uncle.

Id: [0x002C5B8B]
That I see, and I honor it. For I have not come to war against you, but for you. At the request of your father.

Id: [0x002C5B8D]
I offer my support. With my warriors, your Raven Clan can take Kjotve's fortress and settle this rivalry for good.

Id: [0x002C5B92]
I know his face. He met with your father not long ago.

Id: [0x002C5B93]
I know his face. He met with your father not long ago.

Id: [0x002C5B9C]
Outside. This is not something for all eyes.

Id: [0x002C5BA9]
I like it.

Id: [0x002C5BAA]
I like it.

Id: [0x002C5BAB]
This blood feud runs deep, King Harald. We welcome your help, but I must lead the charge.

Id: [0x002C5BAD]
Your trust in me will be repaid.

Id: [0x002C5BAE]
Any man who wishes to see the end of Kjotve is a friend of mine. We thank you, King Harald.

Id: [0x002C5BAF]
Any man who wishes to see the end of Kjotve is a friend of mine. We thank you, King Harald.

Id: [0x002C5BB2]
In time, you may learn more. But not here, where the walls and trees may have ears.

Id: [0x002C5BB3]
Here, let me lead you through our most basic techniques.

Id: [0x002C5BB6]
As you near your target, find your window to strike. Timing is essential.

Id: [0x002C5BBE]
King's Bury. Infested with Rued's men.

Id: [0x002C5BBF]
King's Bury. Infested with Rued's men.

Id: [0x002C5BC8]
Run them down! Trample them into the mud!

Id: [0x002C5BC9]
The tide turns for us!

Id: [0x002C5BCE]
Is it for that withered bag of skin you fight? For Sigurd the sickly?

Id: [0x002C5BD4]
I will tell Fulke her opponent is a weakling who does not have the stomach to finish what they started.

Id: [0x002C5BD5]
You'll join your friend soon enough.

Id: [0x002C5BD7]
If Sigurd dies today, I will find your corpse and piss on it!

Id: [0x002C5BD8]
If Sigurd dies today, I will find your corpse and piss on it!

Id: [0x002C5BDF]
Fall back, you dogs! Back to Portcestre!

Id: [0x002C5BEF]
I understand.

Id: [0x002C5BF3]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002C5BF5]
Hytham, please.

Id: [0x002C5BF8]
Let us leave Eivor to enjoy her gift in peace. Come.

Id: [0x002C5BF9]
What do you make of my new friends?

Id: [0x002C5BFB]
They seem generous and menacing in equal measure.

Id: [0x002C5BFC]
They seem generous and menacing in equal measure.

Id: [0x002C5BFD]
I know what you mean. And they have learning too. They wield numbers and writing as if it were magic.

Id: [0x002C5C04]
The here and now is what matters. Our kinship, our clan … our glory.

Id: [0x002C5C06]
You flatter me, Wolf-Kissed. Keep it up.

Id: [0x002C5C07]
I missed you, Brother. Your clear head and your courage. We have not had enough of both in recent months.

Id: [0x002C5C08]
I missed you, Brother. Your clear head and your courage. We have not had enough of both in recent months.

Id: [0x002C5C11]
This fjord has grown too small to contain me, or I too large. There is so much more beyond these stony fangs that rise around us.

Id: [0x002C5C12]
Tomorrow we make new war on Kjotve. And reclaim the lands he took from us. And from there, we build a kingdom. For us.

Id: [0x002C5C14]
Good. Get some rest and return here at first light.

Id: [0x002C5C15]
From here to Valhalla, I will always be on your side, Sigurd. Always.

Id: [0x002C5C16]
From here to Valhalla, I will always be at your side, Sigurd. Always.

Id: [0x002C5C17]
I'm with you. Only say the word.

Id: [0x002C5C18]
I'm with you. Only say the word.

Id: [0x002C5C1B]
You have curious opinions, Wulfhilda. And an uncommonly opened mind.

Id: [0x002C5C1C]
You have curious opinions, Wulfhilda. And an uncommonly opened mind.

Id: [0x002C5C21]
England, Ireland, Francia … all greener pastures, ripe for the plucking.

Id: [0x002C5C24]
I could start with the dead cows.

Id: [0x002C5C25]
I could start with the dead cows.

Id: [0x002C5C26]
A Jotun did this! I saw it, all big and hairy, staggering across the moor!

Id: [0x002C5C28]
Bite marks, but not from any beast I know. And the corpse is covered in a strange mold, though the wounds are fresh.

I did not touch your herd.

Id: [0x002C5C37]
Stand back, priestess. This is war-work.

Id: [0x002C5C38]
Stand back, priestess. This is war-work.

Id: [0x002C5C39]
Hrothgar and his men, they … they were good to me.

Id: [0x002C5C3F]
The same marks as before. Bite marks, a mauling. These are not weapon wounds.

Id: [0x002C5C40]
The same marks as before. Bite marks, a mauling. These are not weapon wounds.

Id: [0x002C5C52]
We'll wait up here for it to show itself again.

Id: [0x002C5C53]
We will wait up here for it to show itself again.

Id: [0x002C5C64]
I see. Is this a question of honor?

Id: [0x002C5C66]
It is. Many winters ago, Kjotve broke an oath to our fathers. He betrayed a friendly peace and slaughtered many…

Id: [0x002C5C67]
It is. Many winters ago, Kjotve broke an oath to our fathers. He betrayed a friendly peace and slaughtered many…

Id: [0x002C5C6A]
I must strongly disagree, Eivor. This is a gift from the gods.

Id: [0x002C5C6C]
Worry not. The balance has been paid. This victory shall be yours to savor.

Id: [0x002C5C6D]
It is a shame, great king, that you came all this way to offer aid we do not need.

Id: [0x002C5C6E]
It is a shame, great king, that you came all this way to offer aid that we do not need.

Id: [0x002C5C6F]
That may come with a price.

Id: [0x002C5C70]
That may come with a price.

Id: [0x002C5C72]
This war between Kjotve's clan and your own has long simmered on my southern border. I wish to see it put to rest.

Id: [0x002C5C74]
There will be no peace while Kjotve lives. But there is much agreement between your father and me.

Id: [0x002C5C75]
Why risk your men to help us, king? Have you a stake in this fight?

Id: [0x002C5C76]
Why risk your men to help us, king? Have you a stake in this fight?

Id: [0x002C62D2]
I understand.

Id: [0x002C62D4]
Sigurd Jarl will lead the assault against Kjotve and his clan. Give him full command of my ships and my warriors.

Id: [0x002C62D8]
You captain our longship, Eivor. Meet us there and we will claim Kjotve's head for the gods.

Id: [0x002C62DD]
Brother, I have waited too many years for this day. When Kjotve stands before us, give me the final blow.

Id: [0x002C62DE]
Brother, I have waited too many years for this day. When Kjotve stands before us, give me the final blow.

Id: [0x002C62E0]
You will have it, Eivor. You deserve it.

Id: [0x002C62EA]
At last, a chance to test the mettle of these Wessex folk. I wonder how they measure against those of the North?

Id: [0x002C6300]
Leave it for another day. We are here under Harald's truce. And Gorm is too weak to try anything bold.

Id: [0x002C6305]
Said like that, you make me blush.

Id: [0x002C630B]
Gorm is here with the last of his men. Why does that troll dare to show his face?

Id: [0x002C630C]

Is this how your brotherhood operates? You sneak around in the daylight, stabbing your victims where they stand?

I'm blind, you idiot!

Why do you seek that spring?

Id: [0x002C6322]
Why do you seek that spring?

Id: [0x002C6323]
What is this? Is this …[frightened] are we in Hell?

Id: [0x002C6325]
No. We are in England. How are you feeling?

Id: [0x002C6326]
No. We are in England. How are you feeling?

Id: [0x002C63B6]
I feel well … [cough]but it's a little fragrant in here, is it not?

Id: [0x002C63B8]
Attempts? Untimely death? God's blood!

Id: [0x002C63C3]
A key! So fitting, yet what use is a key with no lock?

Id: [0x002C63C4]
A key! So fitting, yet what use is a key with no lock?

[cough]Mold, just mold. Sending visions, like a seer's brew.

Id: [0x002C63CB]
[cough]Mold, just mold. Sending visions, like a seer's brew.

Id: [0x002C63D2]
An inspiring tale, far more fitting than that terrible day. At least she changed my name.

Id: [0x002C63D3]
An inspiring tale, far more fitting than that terrible day. At least she changed my name.

Id: [0x002C63D5]
O, I'll never make it. O, dear Heaven, why have I been afflicted with these legs?

Id: [0x002C63F3]
Eivor! You're alive!

Id: [0x002C63F4]
Cynon, he ordered my death? I don't understand. He's been like a father to me.

Id: [0x002C63F6]
I will ask him myself.

Id: [0x002C63F7]
I will ask him myself.

Id: [0x002C63FA]
I must get to Cynon before the festival's end.

Id: [0x002C63FB]
I must get to Cynon before the festival's end.

Id: [0x002C648A]
The god of death descends upon you!

Id: [0x002C648D]
[laugh]The cowards have reinforcements!

Id: [0x002C648F]
At last! We will crack these Christian monasteries like a row of hens' eggs!

Id: [0x002C6490]
The Saxons know we are here, Dag. Their monasteries will be well guarded.

Id: [0x002C6491]
Nah! By nothing more than priests and prayers, I'd wager!

Id: [0x002C6492]
Eivor. Look there. A monastery.

Id: [0x002C6493]
I stand ready … only say the word!

Id: [0x002C6494]
Are we leaving?

Id: [0x002C6496]
There! Another house of god, fit for raiding.

Id: [0x002C6497]
Freyja's bounty! We must take this one, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C6499]
Or we slay every last man and take all the time we need.

Id: [0x002C649F]
Are you certain there aren't a few more gold nuggets squirreled away somewhere?

Id: [0x002C64A1]
So, Eivor? What's your count?

Id: [0x002C64A3]
Likely story, Wolf-Kissed. Me, I killed … twenty-six I think.

Id: [0x002C64A5]
Nah… There were barely a dozen when we arrived, Dag.

Id: [0x002C64A6]
No, no. You missed them. They attacked from the forest.

Id: [0x002C64A8]
Rest? I was hoping we might get another raid in.

Id: [0x002C64A9]
Eivor! That way, a monastery!

Id: [0x002C64AA]
Ha! Ha! Knew we'd catch this one eventually.

Id: [0x002C64AC]
And kill those guards!

Id: [0x002C64AD]
Bend your ears and listen all! For the good of our clan, it is time we go a-viking! Today we raid, that tomorrow we may build!

Id: [0x002C64AE]

We are scouting, Dag. All in good time.

Id: [0x002C64B0]
We are scouting, Dag. All in good time.

Id: [0x002C64B1]
All ashore! Take what you can and be swift about it!

Id: [0x002C64B2]

Id: [0x002C64B6]
This chest is heavy. Might take more than one to carry it.

Id: [0x002C64B7]
That's enough. Nothing more to find here.

Id: [0x002C64B8]
That's enough. Nothing more to find here.

Id: [0x002C64B9]
That is all we need for Gunnar … but if there is more, we should claim it.

Id: [0x002C64BA]
That is all we need for Gunnar … but if there is more, we should claim it.

Id: [0x002C64BB]
This was a good day and some fine work from all of you. We should return home and unload everything.

Id: [0x002C64BC]

My gut tells me no.

My count? Dag, I have no need to count my kills.

Id: [0x002C64C0]
My count? Dag, I have no need to count my kills.

Id: [0x002C64C1]
We are done here, and have earned our rest as much as our spoils.

Id: [0x002C64C5]
Back so soon? And with good news, I hope.

Id: [0x002C64C7]
I think we have all we need.

Id: [0x002C64C8]
I think we have all we need.

Id: [0x002C64CB]
Tell me Gorm still lives, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C64CD]
Thank you. His day will come.

Id: [0x002C64D1]
It pains me to say … he does.

Id: [0x002C64D2]
It pains me to say … he does.

Id: [0x002C64D3]
Only when you're not giving them.

Id: [0x002C64D4]
Only when you're not giving them.

Id: [0x002C64D5]
It's you lot we should be burning alive!

Id: [0x002C64E5]
It does. Guarded by a gate of hefty iron, held in place by timber spikes. Difficult to force open.

Id: [0x002C64E8]
It does. But how do we reach it?

Id: [0x002C64F6]
Timber burns.

Id: [0x002C64F7]
Timber burns.

Id: [0x002C64F8]
We rig your ship with oil at her front and sail it ablaze at the gate.

Id: [0x002C6500]
Easier said than done. His men are holed up in Burgh Castle, a fortress on the sea.

Id: [0x002C6503]
They would see us coming. Long before we reached the walls.

Id: [0x002C6505]
Saxons willing to die for a bunch of Danes? It's a stretch.

Id: [0x002C6506]
We raise a fyrd, an army of East Anglia's farmers. Throw them at the front gate as a distraction.

With any hope, Theotford remains untouched by Rued's violence.

Id: [0x002C6517]
Maybe so, but I would rather hold on to something, anything, than ride with empty hands.

Hope is a scarce word in this kingdom.

Hej, friend. Could you help me find some of my people? I am looking for Hjorr and Ljufvina.

Of that I am certain.

Of that I am certain.

Hjorr… I know him. Are you a friend?

Hmm. Bitter. Has Hjorr wronged him somehow?

Hmm. Bitter. Has Hjorr wronged him somehow?

Mmmmm … I think I know that name. A woman. She's from Bjarmeland.

Everything is gone, Reeve (Sheriff)! Everything!

Id: [0x002C6573]
I en't got the strength no more.

Id: [0x002C6577]
My love, I am sorry for what happened. I should have been there.

Id: [0x002C6578]
Nonsense. You have your duties to fulfill. Besides, a few bandits is hardly something to worry over.

Id: [0x002C657A]
I am only glad you were not harmed. Eivor, I will be around if you need me.

Id: [0x002C657C]
Old habits die with a struggle.

Id: [0x002C6580]
Eat, my child. These are no times to waste what the Lord has given us.

Id: [0x002C6581]
What about you, Papa? There's so little. There will be none left.

Id: [0x002C6582]
Eat so you'll have strength.

Id: [0x002C6585]
What? What are you saying? The red sparrow will settle in the cuckoo's nest?

Id: [0x002C658D]
Hjorr has changed. Softened.

How about some coin for my trouble?

How about I cut out your tongue?

Id: [0x002C6595]

Yes, I know them, and you seem to know them too. Point me in the right direction.

You have a will of iron coming here, knowing your kind did all this!

You're still a Dane from top to toe. And it's your meddling that led to Oswald's death, leaving our kingdom for the worse.

Id: [0x002C65BE]
I do not see any others. Let's keep moving.

Id: [0x002C65BF]
I do not see any others. Let's keep moving.

This way.

Hjorr! Look who has come!

Oswald died defending East Anglia, defending you. Will you not do the same?

Slow yourselves. Eivor, we cannot just go running around the city poking and prodding and killing at will.

Id: [0x002C65E5]
They nearly did me, Hjorr!

Id: [0x002C65E7]
Corruption has seeped its way into Jorvik. But King Ricsige's hands are full, which means my hands are full.

One way to find out.

We should work together to bring them into the light and kill them before they come to power.

I, Matilda the Seer, lift the veil. Shall I show you what is to come, Raven?

Id: [0x002C6606]
The rooster taunts the hen. "Nock, nock," says he, all a-quiver, "I'll steal your chicks and sling a feather in your eye."

Id: [0x002C6618]
Many of you knew my father, Halfdan the Black. A great man who achieved great things.

Id: [0x002C661A]
They buried Halfdan's leg near our temple! The crops have never grown taller!

Id: [0x002C661C]
They buried his arse near ours and we get nothing but a muddy river!

Id: [0x002C661F]
I dream of something greater. A vast kingdom of warriors, in numbers the world has never seen. United under one king. One rule!

Id: [0x002C6622]
Too much blood has been spilt fighting one another. Today we unify and turn our blades outward to conquer new lands!

Id: [0x002C6624]
But they say a wise king seeks honest counsel. So I ask, who among you rejects this new arrangement?

Id: [0x002C6626]
I am not your enemy, King Harald, but I will not be your subject. Tomorrow, we sail for greener shores, and so, my kingdom is yours.

Id: [0x002C6627]
This saddens me, noble Hjorr. And does your wife agree? Is she not tired of limping ever westward?

Id: [0x002C6628]
My husband and I are as one in this, lord. We do not limp together, we fly.

Id: [0x002C6629]
I am sad to lose a woman of your spirit, Ljufvina. But I hold no grudge. May the fates grant you good luck.

Id: [0x002C662C]
My king! I offer you my axe and my oath, ironclad!

Id: [0x002C662E]
Gorm Kjotvesson. You dare show your face in this hall? Did not King Styrbjorn and his son Sigurd rid our lands of your foulness?

Id: [0x002C662F]
The Raven Clan dishonored me, great king! They poisoned my father, Kjotve! They made a mockery of his honorable death.

Id: [0x002C6633]
Hold, Eivor. Let it play out.

Id: [0x002C6635]
This is a serious charge, Gorm. And a false one at that. My uncle saw your father die.

Id: [0x002C6637]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed. You are Kjotve's slayer. This man has slandered your clan. What shall I do with him?

Id: [0x002C6639]
Gorm, I name you Worm and call you exiled. Leave these lands by the next full moon or I will feed you to the crows myself.

Id: [0x002C663F]
Bacraut! (Asshole!) You lie!

Ah, a visitor for Chad the Bewilderer, the most radiant and rakish Riddler. Do you have the wits to best me? There is cake in it if you do.

Id: [0x002C664F]
Ah, a fine guess. But not the right guess. Another, then.

Id: [0x002C6652]
A fish? A fish? No, no. Let us try another.

Iron is forged with tools? And a keyhole could be the mouth of a door? A lock and key?

Could you return to the boat, please?

Id: [0x002C665D]
Eivor, would you mind coming aboard?

Id: [0x002C665E]
We should get going.

Id: [0x002C6661]
We must not rush our landing. All you see here is Saxon territory. The Kingdom of Mercia, largely unpacified.

Id: [0x002C6662]
There will be eyes watching us from the trees, with bows drawn and traps set. We must be wary.

Id: [0x002C6667]
Exile, lord. Banish him to the wilds where even a slave could kill him with impunity.

Exile, lord. Banish him to the wilds where even a slave could kill him with impunity.

Id: [0x002C666A]
Understandable, but a quick death is too good for a draugr (ghoul) like him.

Id: [0x002C666B]
I would send him to Hel, as I did his father.

Id: [0x002C666C]
I would send him to Hel, as I did his father.

Id: [0x002C666D]
And he is happier for it. For my part, I look forward to standing in the footsteps of the giants that built this land.

Id: [0x002C666E]
Every brick and stone tells a story of conquest and glory, and now they are rubble and ash.

Id: [0x002C666F]
Ready to be remade! We will rebuild their empire, brick by brick! And ours will not crumble to dust.

Id: [0x002C6670]
All things end, Dag. Ruins are not a warning, they are a testament.

You are king of these lands, Harald. The decision must be yours.

Id: [0x002C6673]
You are king of these lands, Harald. The decision must be yours.

From strangers into friends into family.

The others have arrived. Come.

Thor's beard! My leg!

We know it's the Danes. It's always the damn Danes. Make them pay wergild (penance) for the dead that now litter the fields!

Id: [0x002C670E]
Show sense, please! What would the Danes gain from the slaughter of poor farmers?

Id: [0x002C670F]
A modest and honorable answer.

Id: [0x002C6720]
Giants aren't real. You saw the Devil himself, taking his tithe to Hell!

Id: [0x002C6725]
It was a Jotun! As great as a tree, and it laughed while it ripped and teared. It yelled out its name, Grendel!

Count on it, my friend. The path ahead is bright.

With glory at its end.

So, you admit this is the Devil's work? Or one of your wooden dragons come to life?

Id: [0x002C67DA]
Three times these attacks have happened. Each time bite marks, broken bones, and streaks of mold.

Id: [0x002C67DB]
No … no mortal hand could rend flesh in such a way. Surely you see that.

To protect my boy. He never meant to hurt anyone. But the others, they could not see.

And look where that got him.

We heard you talking with the reeve (sheriff). And we wish to fight beside you. We owe Oswald for his good deeds and fair rule.

Id: [0x002C6C14]
Eivor. Eivor, come.

Id: [0x002C6C20]
Tewdwr? Tewdwr!

Id: [0x002C6C21]
Tewdwr? Tewdwr!

Id: [0x002C6C23]
Tewdwr! Where are you?

Id: [0x002C6C24]
Tewdwr! Where are you?

Id: [0x002C6C36]
Have you spoken with Sigurd yet?

Id: [0x002C6C39]
Not yet. Soon.

Id: [0x002C6C3A]
Not yet. Soon.

Id: [0x002C6C3C]
A monk called Gwilim poured some of it into my drink last night. The effects were intense.

Id: [0x002C6C3F]
You took your time to find me. Was it for this, to enjoy your time on my throne?

Id: [0x002C6C41]
He's been this way since his return.

Id: [0x002C6C50]
Would a soul in these lands, pay heed to a man, who wanders this world without a clan?[music sfx]

Id: [0x002C6C5B]
Well, now! There is no excuse too small, I see … nothing to keep you from coveting that seat, is there?

Id: [0x002C6C5D]
You might leave them to work it out for themselves. But that would mean … letting go, would it not?

Id: [0x002C6C5F]
Of course.

Id: [0x002C6C60]
Of course.

Id: [0x002C6C61]
In Sigurd's absence, who has better claim to oversee these disputes?

A song I will sing, for silver or a ring, because a bard is me, as true as can be![music sfx]

Id: [0x002C6C69]
Where's Sigurd gone?

Id: [0x002C6C6A]
Where's Sigurd gone?

Id: [0x002C6C6B]
In the cemetery. His mood is dark.

Id: [0x002C6C6C]
In the cemetery. His mood is dark.

Id: [0x002C6C6D]
There you are, Brother.

Id: [0x002C6C6E]
There you are, Brother.

Id: [0x002C6C70]
The deeds of the great are a bard's stock in trade. The brave are wealthy, the wealthy are brave. [singsong]So it goes.

Id: [0x002C6C74]
How about it, Eivor the Wanderer? Part with a queen's ransom and live on in immortal song?

Id: [0x002C6C7A]
Frugal and rude? You're even less fun than you look.

Id: [0x002C6C7B]
I heard you sing, bard. Your songs aren't worth a copper bit.

Id: [0x002C6C7C]
I heard you sing, bard. Your songs aren't worth a copper bit.

Id: [0x002C6C82]
Both wise and generous! Truly, you are history's mightiest champion. Now, hold tight while my muse inspires me.

Id: [0x002C6C83]
Silver comes and silver goes, but the fame of the great endures.

Id: [0x002C6C84]
Silver comes and silver goes, but the fame of the great endures.

Id: [0x002C6C86]
The world weeps at its loss! [beat]Go forth and plunder, so that all may hear your praises properly sung.

Id: [0x002C6C87]
Let me find a fuller purse someday, and perhaps I shall return.

Id: [0x002C6C8C]
From beyond the whale-roads, from history unknown, did the Norse take a stand, and now all must atone.

Id: [0x002C6C8D]
Succumb to your fate with a kiss, a blade to your throat, the wolf's fangs to your shins.

Id: [0x002C6C94]
There was a cheap little Norse, stinking of ale, with a face like a horse, and a pony for a tail.

Id: [0x002C6C95]
What was the name of this hideous boar? To speak it brings shame, but it's Eivor! Eivor!

Id: [0x002C6CA2]
Eivor. A moment of your time?

Id: [0x002C6CCE]
It cannot end like this.

Id: [0x002C6CF5]
It is likely the wine for the Yuletide feast. Do you think one of the council means to kill someone?

Id: [0x002C6CF6]
A load of wine was removed from here, and the room smells of almonds. It may be the wine was poisoned.

Id: [0x002C6CF7]
A load of wine was removed from here, and the room smells of almonds. It may be the wine was poisoned.

Id: [0x002C6CF8]
What? Die in defense of a lost cause? I have problems of my own.

Id: [0x002C6D07]
I must return and prepare for the Yuletide feast, but I will do so with a bent ear and a keen eye. Be safe.

Id: [0x002C6D09]
One down, two left.

Id: [0x002C6D0A]
One down, two left.

Id: [0x002C6D25]
Pretty words, Dane. But the men of Theotford have their own battles to fight.

Id: [0x002C6D44]
It is loaded with silver.

Id: [0x002C6D45]
It is loaded with silver.

Id: [0x002C6D5A]
Are we almost there?

Id: [0x002C6D5F]
Do you see the wine?

Id: [0x002C6D60]
Do you see the wine?

Id: [0x002C6D65]
The entire council is here. Any one of them could be The Vault.

Id: [0x002C6D7E]
My promise holds, aye. Theotford will join you in the fight against Rued's clan.

Id: [0x002C6D81]
With your aid, we may yet save East Anglia.

Id: [0x002C6D82]
With your aid, we may yet save East Anglia.

Id: [0x002C6D86]
Even Hjorr?

Id: [0x002C6D8C]
I need you to keep an eye out for the wine. I will speak to each of the council members. See if I can trap them in a lie.

The abbess has her suspicions.

Id: [0x002C6D97]
The Red Hand seem to know where to look for these texts. It may be someone is guiding them. What can you tell me?

Id: [0x002C6D98]
The Red Hand seem to know where to look for these texts. It may be someone is guiding them. What can you tell me?

Id: [0x002C6D9E]
There you are. I was beginning to worry.

Id: [0x002C6DA1]
You are certain?

Id: [0x002C6DA3]
Of course. What do you need me to do?

Id: [0x002C6DAB]
I need a distraction. Keep their eyes off of me. The wine should arrive soon. Drink three full cups, then make a scene.

Id: [0x002C6DAC]

That's not good.

That's not good.

Id: [0x002C6DC3]
It is my duty to protect the role of Christianity in our lives.

An abbess does not strike me as a suitable choice against a gang of ruthless bandits.

You are finished here, Rued!

Id: [0x002C6DD0]
The forces will be ready soon.

Id: [0x002C6DD2]
Men are pouring in from across East Anglia. And our ships stand ready.

Id: [0x002C6DD3]
Are you ready to start the assault now?

Id: [0x002C6DD7]
We await your return.

Id: [0x002C6DE0]
I need more time.

Id: [0x002C6DE1]
I need more time.

Id: [0x002C6DE4]
Forgive me, Eivor, but as an outsider, I do not understand your stake in this. For that, I am reluctant to trust you.

Id: [0x002C6DE8]
You say you are keeping the texts safe. Where?

Id: [0x002C6DE9]
You say you are keeping the texts safe. Where?

Id: [0x002C6DF4]
It seems Oswald got what he wanted in the end. Saxon and Dane, united in common cause.

Id: [0x002C6DF6]
Theotford's reeve is with us. His men will be here soon.

Id: [0x002C6DF7]
Theotford's reeve is with us. His men will be here soon.

A pity he is not here to see it.

Id: [0x002C6DF9]
A pity he is not here to see it.

Id: [0x002C6DFD]
More than his. The King's Bury horn has inspired men all across this kingdom. We will have the army we need.

Id: [0x002C6E03]
Are you ready to start the assault?

Id: [0x002C6E14]
Each of the council members has given me reason to suspect them. Some more than others.

What's more, The Needle was collecting silver for The Vault. I think Hjorr was taking this money and funding The Order.

Did you hear what happened to Archibald?

Id: [0x002C6E24]
Aye, the drunken fool. I was there when he lit that thing on fire. We all told him not to, but he dared tempt fate.

Id: [0x002C6E25]
You saw it all? Go on, tell us what happened.

Id: [0x002C6E34]
Gods, no…

Id: [0x002C6E3B]
When I pressed him about a drinking contest, he opposed drinking the wine and insisted on ale.

Audun was the one pushing for the feast from the start. He planned it, which means he would have had access to the wine.

Hjorr's desk used to be against the other wall.

Id: [0x002C6E4D]
A hidden entrance … where does this lead?

Id: [0x002C6E4F]
Scratch marks on the floor.

Scratch marks on the floor.

So why the change?

Id: [0x002C6EC5]
I could muster a few complaints about the king and the treasury, but I shall forbear. You did it, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C6ECB]
We did. It may be we were the recipe to keep Norway from Harald all along.

Id: [0x002C6ECC]
We did. It may be we were the recipe to keep Norway from Harald all along.

Id: [0x002C6ED2]
You remember the dream I spoke of?

Id: [0x002C6ED4]
Here it may come to pass.

Id: [0x002C6EDF]
You sailed through Helheim on a ship of fire.

Id: [0x002C6EE0]
You sailed through Helheim on a ship of fire.

Id: [0x002C6EF0]
You are quite the agent of chaos. Fulke's men are chasing their tails, not knowing where you will strike next.

Id: [0x002C6EF1]
Portcestre has neither the supplies nor the forces to keep us out now.

Id: [0x002C6EF2]
And you have bought time for your allies to arrive. Many have come, not least the bishop here.

Id: [0x002C6F02]
Dreams. Life. It may be they are one and the same.

Id: [0x002C6F03]
Dreams. Life. It may be they are one and the same.

I will not be long.

I will not be long.

Id: [0x002C6F0A]
Let us begin.

We march. When the sun sets on this day, Sigurd will be returned to us and Fulke's head will be on a spike.

No. Norway is behind me now, and the rest of England ahead. That said, I must be going.

Let me go, heathens! Have you not taken enough from us already?

Id: [0x002C6F46]
They are. Bows strung and arrows fletched.

Id: [0x002C6F48]
What are friends for?

Id: [0x002C6F49]
Ever my staunch ally, Ljufvina. Are your men ready?

Id: [0x002C6F4A]
Ever my staunch ally, Ljufvina. Are your men ready?

Id: [0x002C6F4C]
I know I can count on you, Ljufvina.

Id: [0x002C6F50]
I appreciate your efforts to spare the innocent, Eivor. At least we saved some lives here.

Id: [0x002C6F53]
And so violence begets violence. "An eye for an eye" as the Good Book says. But soon, we will all be blind.

Id: [0x002C6F57]
I only wish the path to peace were not paved with so many skulls.

Id: [0x002C6F59]
One day, Saxon and Dane, Norse and Briton, will live as brothers and sisters, as they do in Lunden.

Let those who seek war look beyond our shores. If King Harald brings peace, then I am happy to bend my knee to him.

Id: [0x002C6F64]
The legend says that Ostara, the goddess of spring, transformed a bird into a hare at this very spot.

Id: [0x002C6F65]
The hare then laid colored eggs for her festival! The place has great magic.

Id: [0x002C6F6B]
Shame. I've heard your voice. Clear as a bell. Larks fall from the sky in envy.

Id: [0x002C6F70]
Securing a lasting peace, Sigurd. Our days of fighting are finished.

Id: [0x002C6F71]
You will die a thrall, you drink-addled cow! Alone and toothless in a bed of straw!

Id: [0x002C6F74]
Advance. Be on the lookout for any stray guards.

Id: [0x002C6F75]
Advance. Be on the lookout for any stray guards.

Id: [0x002C6F76]
Forgive my son. He is ruled by his emotions.

Id: [0x002C6F78]
It is natural to fear change. To resist it. But all things change and all things end. The lessons of Ragnarok are clear.

Id: [0x002C6F7A]
We will speak again soon.

Id: [0x002C6F81]
For some days, yes, I did. But it was not at my urging. This was his decision alone.

Id: [0x002C6F82]
That was an ambush, lord. Did you know of Styrbjorn's plans?

Id: [0x002C6F83]
That was an ambush, lord. Did you know of Styrbjorn's plans?

Id: [0x002C6F8B]
A few things you should know before you step into his camp.

Id: [0x002C6F96]
Tewdwr? Are you here?

Id: [0x002C6F97]
Tewdwr? Are you here?

Id: [0x002C6F99]
I will. Lead on.

Id: [0x002C6F9A]
I will. Lead on.

Id: [0x002C6F9C]
Not just yet. But I will return soon.

Id: [0x002C6F9D]

Id: [0x002C6FA7]
I should add, our young friend Hytham has been conferring with his own contacts in the cities.

Id: [0x002C6FA8]
His research could be useful in winning us alliances throughout the cities of England. Speak with him and see what he needs.

Id: [0x002C6FAF]
I added his information to the map if you would like to know what he has discovered.

Id: [0x002C6FB1]
I believe it will, for we have common cause against our enemy. They have dug their claws deep into England.

Id: [0x002C6FB4]
It is magnificent and calming color. A balm for sea-salted eyes.

Id: [0x002C6FB5]
You speak first of yourself when I ask this question … which says more than you intend, I think.

Id: [0x002C6FBA]
This way. We found a fine spot for you at the foot of the hill.

Id: [0x002C6FBB]
This way. We found a fine spot for you at the foot of the hill.

And how close were you?

Id: [0x002C6FBD]
And how close were you?

Id: [0x002C6FC3]
No need for foresight. I feel it in my heart.

Id: [0x002C6FC9]
Enough! Keep your brawls to the other side of the river! There's children about.

Id: [0x002C6FCB]
I don't answer to you, witch.

Id: [0x002C6FCC]
Tamas Fletcher, I brought you into this world, wiped your mother's birth blood from your face. Mind your tongue.

Id: [0x002C6FD5]
And does the All-Father still appear before you?

Id: [0x002C6FD8]
You see there, your home is just ahead.

Id: [0x002C6FD9]
You see there, your home is just ahead.

With every return, the things I see feel less like dreams and more like memories.

With every return, the things I see feel less like dreams and more like memories.

Id: [0x002C6FDE]
No one defiles this sacred throne and goes unpunished!

Id: [0x002C6FE0]
We will fight for this muddy kingdom tooth and nail!

Id: [0x002C6FF7]
Men drown themselves in ale on Samhain. [Serious]But I fear for the fragile peace when Tewdwr becomes ealdorman.

Id: [0x002C6FF8]
Your aid is welcome.

Id: [0x002C6FF9]
Your aid is welcome.

Id: [0x002C6FFA]
Let's see that leg, then.

Id: [0x002C6FFE]
(unintelligible)[Men will be foolish, regardless of who holds power.]

Id: [0x002C7002]
Will he walk again?

Id: [0x002C7003]
Will he walk again?

Id: [0x002C7008]
I lead those who follow the Old Ways in Glowecestrescire. But I offer my healing services on both sides of the river.

Id: [0x002C7009]
That man called you a witch.

Id: [0x002C700A]
That man called you a witch.

Id: [0x002C700B]
It would be best for us both if you left Norway. To avoid the heat that comes with such friction.

Id: [0x002C700F]
That may be. But however firmly we make our choices, it is fate that decides our outcome.

Id: [0x002C7012]
I have no ambition to rule. Only to live and die with glory.

Id: [0x002C7013]
I have no ambition to rule. Only to live and die with glory.

Id: [0x002C7014]
But let us leave these matters for another time. Tonight, we will eat and drink like gods and wake in a kingdom made new.

Id: [0x002C7017]
You intrigue me, Wolf-Kissed. Orphan and sibling. Warrior and poet. You are many in one, it seems.

Id: [0x002C7019]
I have eyes and ears everywhere, as any effective king must. Would you not be one of my ravens?

Id: [0x002C701B]
I understand. Yet should your fortunes change, you are welcome in my hall.

Id: [0x002C701C]
You know much about me.

Id: [0x002C701D]
You know much about me.

I'm bound to Sigurd. And he to me. But if fate should cross our threads again…

I am bound to Sigurd. And he to me. But if fate should cross our threads again…

Id: [0x002C7021]
Gwenydd, my love, go back to the house and bring me the garlic salve.

Id: [0x002C7022]
And the worms? Are we cleaning or cutting, Mother?

Id: [0x002C7032]
Where will we live?

Id: [0x002C7033]
The English will fight back! The wars will never end!

Id: [0x002C7034]
Or they will push us into the Christian ways.

Id: [0x002C7035]
Quiet! All! Give me a chance to speak!

Id: [0x002C7037]
It's Eivor. Open the door.

It's Eivor. Open the door.

Id: [0x002C7044]
Shit … Kjotve's warriors.

Shit … Kjotve's warriors.

Id: [0x002C704C]
I need air.

Id: [0x002C704F]
Could you speak with him? Settle his mind.

Id: [0x002C7051]
I can try.

Id: [0x002C7052]
I can try.

Id: [0x002C7053]
I wish I understood you better. For those I do not understand, I do not trust. And I cannot stomach a lack of trust.

Id: [0x002C7057]
Then know, that if you stay in Norway, both you and your brother must serve under me. Take tomorrow to think on this.

Id: [0x002C7058]
You have nothing to fear from me, King Harald. My loyalty lies with my brother, Sigurd, and I bear you no ill will.

Dag died defending my honor?

Id: [0x002C7063]
Shhh…

Id: [0x002C7064]
Sigurd…?

Id: [0x002C7065]
Sigurd…?

Id: [0x002C7067]
Dag, not now. I need to speak with Randvi.

Id: [0x002C7068]
Dag, not now. I need to speak with Randvi.

Id: [0x002C706A]
You never found him … because you didn't look.

Id: [0x002C706D]
Eivor! Eivor!

Id: [0x002C7070]
Dag. Turn around and walk away.

Id: [0x002C7071]
Dag. Turn around and walk away.

Id: [0x002C7074]
I will find Sigurd. You will not be without your jarl. This I promise.

Id: [0x002C7075]
I will find Sigurd. You will not be without your jarl. This I promise.

Id: [0x002C7079]
I'm scared for Father. Can you see him down there?

Id: [0x002C707C]
I was tested, Eivor. In a crucible of blood and fire. And in my agony, I was reborn.

Id: [0x002C707E]
You may think me less than I was, but this is not so. I am greater than before.

Id: [0x002C707F]
My mind is a wellspring of prophecies. Visions that tell me who I truly am. And for all that, I am grateful for my suffering.

Id: [0x002C7080]
Basim saw these things in me. Fulke too. Despite her cruelty, she spoke the truth.

Id: [0x002C7082]
You must look harder, Eivor. Deeper. See for yourself what they found in me.

Id: [0x002C7083]
Do you see it? My greater self?

Id: [0x002C7085]
Look! This is the face of a god!

Id: [0x002C708A]
I … I don't know what that means.

Id: [0x002C708B]
I … I don't know what that means.

Id: [0x002C708E]
Blood and sweat, death and birth. Turn this man from beast to earth.

Here's their father, and the treasure that lured him to his doom.

I am more than the man I was, more than this hobbling stick that stands before you.

Id: [0x002C709D]
So he says, but the only thing he ever catches is more gambling debts. I fear I cannot keep him around.

Id: [0x002C70A2]
You are kind, but your eyes are clouded by the past, a place I can no longer see. I fear our paths diverged long ago.

Id: [0x002C70A4]
Go. I wish to be alone. Return to my feast and drink for me. Celebrate the days to come <LF>in my name.

Id: [0x002C70A5]
I see only my brother and my truest friend, returned to where he is loved and cherished.

Id: [0x002C70A6]

Id: [0x002C70AA]
Did you hear that sound after I pushed the rock down?[splat]

Id: [0x002C70AB]
Eir, give me strength!

Id: [0x002C70AC]
Yes, grab the worms just to be safe. Now, go, child. I promise not to cut it off before you return.

Id: [0x002C70B0]
That limb will be fine. But no medicine in England will stop the dribble from his mouth. I do not work miracles.

Id: [0x002C70B2]
Loki Rabbit! I call on you, nay, demand of you: Send me a holmgang champion to test my might!

Id: [0x002C70B3]
Is this the champion you've conjured for the holmgang, Loki Rabbit? Looks like a fine fighter to me.

Id: [0x002C70BD]
Where are you off to, "Loki?"

Id: [0x002C70BE]
Where are you off to, "Loki?"

Id: [0x002C70C6]
What was that noise?

Id: [0x002C70C8]
Saint Kenhelm, my boy, if you've any mercy to spare, grant it to this old sinner.

Id: [0x002C70CE]
No, I can't see anything! The lake's dark, and I'm cold.

Id: [0x002C70CF]
And you, Eivor, friend of Glowecestrescire. You have lived up to your reputation.

Id: [0x002C70D7]
He dove way down deep, but I can't see him anymore.

Id: [0x002C7108]
And where is that fool? Drunk in some bed? Working off a debt?

Id: [0x002C7109]
I found your husband.

Id: [0x002C710A]
I found your husband.

Id: [0x002C710D]
Dead, I fear. Some bandits crushed him with a rock, hoping to fleece him.

Id: [0x002C710E]
Dead, I fear. Some bandits crushed him with a rock, hoping to fleece him.

Id: [0x002C7111]
His mother's ring! That fool, that damned, soft, loving fool. [beat]Thank you, stranger. At least I have this.

Id: [0x002C7119]
Yes, flee, you coward! Just like Loki Rabbit-Heart!

Id: [0x002C711F]
Your champion comes crawling back, Loki Rabbit! Good! I am ready.

Id: [0x002C7122]
Yield.

Id: [0x002C7123]
Yield.

Id: [0x002C7125]
Aye! And what did Loki Rabbit promise you, champion? Wealth? Fame? Honor?

Id: [0x002C7127]
The rabbit said nothing. A lesson you should learn.

Id: [0x002C7128]

Hm … a list of names, ages … all killed by a plague. "The Withering."

It destroys the mind and heightens aggression in an individual, and ultimately, the poor soul is rendered catatonic.

Why are you here alone?

Aldwyn, my sweet! I'm here, I'm here! I even wrote you a poem, the kind you adore. Will you not listen?

But why must we burn them?

Id: [0x002C7279]
The fire cleanses impurities, and it is our duty to purify the future of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002C7281]
What thegns (nobles) would risk their arses now? Oswald was the last with even a scrap of courage.

Id: [0x002C7284]
What action?

Id: [0x002C7286]
You have not failed him. Rued's clan is badly weakened. We can still cure what ails these lands.

Id: [0x002C728F]
Hmph.

Id: [0x002C7297]
You there. Did you hear of Thegn Oswald's fate?

Id: [0x002C7299]
Aye, we did. He dragged Rued to the bowels of Hell, the Dane devil.

Id: [0x002C729D]
Rued may be gone, but his clan still plagues East Anglia. Would you join us to rid your kingdom of his dogs?

Id: [0x002C729E]
For Oswald? Aye! Anything!

Id: [0x002C72B1]
You said you loved my face!

Id: [0x002C72B2]
I do. Which is why I wanted a smaller, sweeter version of it. Ostara will bless me with a child.

Id: [0x002C72B3]
That pagan rock holds no magic. Besides … there are wolves. Big ones. With teeth.

It can work, Finnr. If they fight in Oswald's name, that is all the courage they will need.

Id: [0x002C72C3]
Two eager Saxons is not yet a fyrd (peasant army). But you may be right. We may have a chance.

Id: [0x002C72CF]
No! Stay away from me! Stay back! Agh!

Id: [0x002C72DC]
Ahhh… I knew I should have left with the others.

Id: [0x002C72EC]
Damned Picts! Not only do they hold the North, but those lawless shits have free-roam in our lands as well!

Id: [0x002C72ED]
Under the ground! Only one of them has returned, bone-beaten and bloodied! The howling mother take them!

Id: [0x002C72EF]
Ljufvina, a moment of your time? And Hjorr if he is about.

Id: [0x002C72F2]
Hjorr said our spies are on the ground--

Id: [0x002C72F4]
I will be with you shortly.

Id: [0x002C735A]
I refuse to pick at that wound again. But if there is something that can chase these shadows from your thoughts--

Id: [0x002C7360]
Nonsense! You are the very spirit of the Mari Lwyd. Now, let's hooden!

We do indeed, and we are ready to fight. King Harald's forces are well in place. Only give the word.

Id: [0x002C7404]
That Eivor may give challenge to Kjotve at the gates of his fortress. A battle to the death in single combat.

Id: [0x002C7407]
When honor is at stake, let none interfere. And if Kjotve should die before the battle begins, all the better for our chances.

Id: [0x002C744A]
Liar, liar, liar! You will join them, all the unkind dead! Now I open the scars of my heart!

Id: [0x002C744F]
Lead me to Clee Hill Spring! My sight will return! I'll see birds and trees! Flowers and clouds!

Id: [0x002C7450]
O, thank you so much for pissing on my dreams. Do me a kindness, would you? Shove something in your gruel hole.

Id: [0x002C7454]
Eivor! Are you bewitched? Unbind us!

Id: [0x002C7456]
What? O … yes, of course.

Id: [0x002C7457]
What? O … yes, of course.

Hail, Dane! Over here!

Id: [0x002C74CA]
I heard the horn's call, but I thought I was dreaming. I will join the fyrd. Just name the place.

Id: [0x002C74DD]
Eivor, give us a hand!

That damned bacraut (asshole) … slipped through my fingers. I'll finish this in Coppergate market.

Grigorii…

Id: [0x002C74EA]
Good to take in the air. The sights. The sounds. The smells.

Id: [0x002C74EB]
P-please, Grigorii. I-I-I didn't think you would mind. It was just a few coins!

Id: [0x002C74EC]
Shh shh … I understand. It's not your fault, it was mine, for thinking you had anything but empty air between your ears.

Id: [0x002C74ED]
With all the silver I've given you, I have nothing left to feed my children, let alone myself. Please, understand.

Id: [0x002C74EF]
O, dear God…

Id: [0x002C74F0]
Merchants of Jorvik. I promised you a future rife with opportunity. And what was the one thing I asked in return?

Id: [0x002C74F2]
Do you remember?

Id: [0x002C74F3]
Loyalty.

Id: [0x002C74F5]
Loyalty!

Id: [0x002C74F9]
Let this serve as a lesson, should any of you think it a good idea to threaten my operation.

Id: [0x002C7511]
No fair! You're too good!

Id: [0x002C7512]
No, you're just bad, 'cause you always hide in the same spot.

Id: [0x002C7513]
Found you, Pebble!

Id: [0x002C7515]
Aw! You peeked, didn't you!

Hah! Nothing escapes the mighty nose of Fenrir!

They are a gift. They spread the word of God, and it is that which must be preserved, whatsoever the cost.

Id: [0x002C7561]
O, blessed. Your mother? When was last you saw her?

Id: [0x002C7562]
Before the bad men came. Said she'd be right back. But she ain't.

Id: [0x002C7563]
She will be, little one. I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x002C7564]
If you say so.

Id: [0x002C7565]
Calm, my friend. We will rebuild. I promise you.

Id: [0x002C7567]
Who me? Ah! Please, I've a bigger sword than the lot of 'em.

Id: [0x002C7586]
The Red Hand, who else? They muscle their way to and fro. No one has done a thing about it.

Id: [0x002C758C]
Show me there.

Id: [0x002C758D]
Show me there.

Id: [0x002C7590]
Wh-what do you want from me?

Yes, I surprised myself, for what it's worth. If I cannot be ealdorman, I can at least honor my father by acting as one.

Hunwald. This is quite a surprise. Welcome.

The land thrives under my guidance, I believe. But gods, I am itching to kill something, and so are my berserkers.

Vili, you stiff old arse-stick! How are you?

Careful, Eivor. Don't make me thrash your hide as I did when we were children.

Id: [0x002C761B]
Well, it will be Saxons weeping today, after me and my berserkers get hold of them.

Id: [0x002C761C]
As I recall, it was you who always finished snot-faced and teary-eyed.

Id: [0x002C761D]

Do that, and you and I will raise a horn together.

We will harry the enemy from the flanks to keep them off your back. They will not have a moment's peace from us.

Good. We will rain death upon our enemies today. Good work, Hunwald. Be ready.

You did this?

Id: [0x002C762E]
You did this?

Id: [0x002C7630]
Eivor, forgive me. I have slain too many of my own people already. I cannot kill more. I must return to Lunden.

Id: [0x002C7632]
Someone has to keep an eye on him in the big city. He would only get himself killed otherwise.

And you, Erke? Do you feel the same?

Id: [0x002C763D]
Godspeed, Eivor. I pray you come back safe.

Id: [0x002C7642]
We thrive like the first roses of spring!  Though not without thorns. True love is never quite as smooth as in the tales, eh?

Id: [0x002C7643]
Eluric said you talked some sense into him, before he drowned his wits in mead. Alfida and I thank you deeply for that.

Id: [0x002C7647]
Your help in my hour of need is thanks enough.

Id: [0x002C7648]
Your help in my hour of need is thanks enough.

Id: [0x002C7649]
I have brought for you a ram of unsurpassed craftsmanship. Their gates will not hold long against it.

Id: [0x002C764B]
That is a fine gift indeed. I will make good use of it.

Id: [0x002C764C]
That is a fine gift indeed. I will make good use of it.

Id: [0x002C764F]
Alfida keeps my house and heart in order. She has even charmed that old shrew Eadred.

Id: [0x002C7651]
Birstan. I'm glad to see you again. How is your family?

Id: [0x002C7652]
Birstan. I'm glad to see you again. How is your family?

Id: [0x002C7653]
And Eluric? He has not returned?

Id: [0x002C7654]
And Eluric? He has not returned?

Id: [0x002C7658]
Fight hard, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C765A]
When have I done otherwise?

Id: [0x002C765B]
When have I done otherwise?

Id: [0x002C7681]
Eivor … I will … I will fight … as a thresher through a field of wheat, Mad One.

Id: [0x002C7693]
Sigurd?

Id: [0x002C7694]
Sigurd?

Id: [0x002C769A]
Soma should be somewhere nearby.

Id: [0x002C769B]
Soma should be somewhere nearby.

Id: [0x002C76B4]
We took this town as if it were a straw-hall. Do not challenge me, Elf-King.

Id: [0x002C76BC]
I should consult with Basim. He will be nearby.

Id: [0x002C76BD]
I should consult with Basim. He will be nearby.

Fulke! Damn you to Hel!

Fulke! Damn you to Hel!

Id: [0x002C76F7]
Nobody touch her. She is mine.

Id: [0x002C76F8]
Nobody touch her. She is mine.

Id: [0x002C76FA]
Ubba will be nearby.

Id: [0x002C76FB]
Ubba will be nearby.

Id: [0x002C76FD]
You are too late, Eivor. I have opened your brother's mind to the truth. That is my victory.

Id: [0x002C76FF]
And you will go with me to the grave.

Id: [0x002C7711]
It's okay, friend. You know where to find me if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002C7713]
Those stuffed targets are hard to see if your eye is slow!

Id: [0x002C7714]
Otta, will you sign this stone I kept?

Id: [0x002C7719]
Fulke!

Id: [0x002C771A]
Fulke!

Id: [0x002C771B]
Nice one!

Id: [0x002C771D]
Well struck, Dane!

Id: [0x002C771E]
Well, I'll be… You knocked the straw right out of that dummy's belly!

Id: [0x002C771F]
Well, well. Twang! Twang! Twang! You've got some firepower in you.

Id: [0x002C7721]
You're right, Eivor of Raven Clan! Hey, come on back if you ever want to dance again.

Id: [0x002C7732]
But not with you? Where is he?

Id: [0x002C7734]
You never found him, did you? Tell us, Eivor! We deserve the truth!

Id: [0x002C7738]
I see you, Eivor. I know what you are.

Id: [0x002C773A]
He … He is alive.

Id: [0x002C773B]
He … He's alive.

Id: [0x002C773C]
I need to speak with Randvi. Step aside. Now.

Id: [0x002C773D]
I need to speak with Randvi. Step aside. Now.

Id: [0x002C773F]
Your habits are not my own, Eivor. I do not flee responsibility for the sake of my glory. I stand firm with my people.

Id: [0x002C7743]
Eivor, you came!

Id: [0x002C7744]
Where is honor to be found?

Id: [0x002C7745]
I am lost and honor-bound.

Id: [0x002C7746]
I feel I'm going round and round.

Id: [0x002C7747]
This quest will put me in the ground.

Id: [0x002C7748]
For many months, I have stood at your side, keeping faith in Sigurd's judgment. Because I believed in him and his vision.

Id: [0x002C7749]
Do as Eivor commands, he told me. And I have. Against my better judgment, I did as you have asked me.

Id: [0x002C774A]
And where has that left us? Without a jarl, without a purpose, watching you chase glory around this land like a spooked hare.

Id: [0x002C774B]
You arrived without a sound!

Id: [0x002C774D]
A skald? O, no, not at all. I am truly looking for honor, and have become lost as a result.

Id: [0x002C774F]
I am the seventh son of a seventh son. I am expected to bring great honor to my family, but everything has been done!

Id: [0x002C7750]
My uncles and brothers have all had great victories or even greater deaths! There is nothing left for me to do!

Id: [0x002C7757]
Are you a skald? I have never heard poetry shouted in this way.

Id: [0x002C7758]
Are you a skald? I have never heard poetry shouted in this way.

Id: [0x002C7759]
You are looking for honor here? It is a bit remote.

Id: [0x002C775A]
You are looking for honor here? It is a bit remote.

Id: [0x002C7769]
I have no need of it. My mind is fixed.

Id: [0x002C7772]
Enough!

Id: [0x002C7773]
You spew nonsense, Dag. This is absurd.

Id: [0x002C7774]
You spew nonsense, Dag. This is absurd.

Id: [0x002C7775]
Let the circle be made!

Id: [0x002C7786]
Do you know nothing? [sigh]The enchanted waters heal people! You just have to show up. But I'll never make it.

Id: [0x002C7791]
He is a seed-stain on his father's trousers. I should wipe him from this world.

Id: [0x002C7792]
He is a seed-stain on his father's trousers. I should wipe him from this world.

Id: [0x002C77AB]
Eh! You've gone soft!

Id: [0x002C77AC]
Pathetic!

Id: [0x002C77AD]
Face me, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C77B4]
If I had any pity, I would not lavish it on this poor fool.

Id: [0x002C77B6]
War and squalor as well.

Id: [0x002C77B7]
War and squalor as well.

Id: [0x002C77BA]
All he demanded, you gave him. That should be enough, for I have no need for one so fragile in my hall of heroes.

Id: [0x002C77BD]
He forced my hand.

Id: [0x002C77BE]
He forced my hand.

Id: [0x002C77BF]
He fought for what he believed in. Does that not count for something?

Id: [0x002C77C0]
He fought for what he believed in. Does that not count for something?

Id: [0x002C77C2]
They do not. But they will not scoff at our visit.

Id: [0x002C77C3]
Of the four kingdoms in England, the Sons of Ragnar have settled only one. The rest is ripe for the taking.

Id: [0x002C77C4]
Do we mean to join their army?

Id: [0x002C77C6]
Not tonight, Eivor. Leave it.

Id: [0x002C77C8]
Basim, watch over this one and see that she warms herself with drink. I will find my father and escort him to the longhouse.

Id: [0x002C77CA]
As you wish.

Id: [0x002C77D0]
I know where Gorm is camped. If you wish to see him without anyone the wiser, there is a trick I can teach you.

Id: [0x002C77D5]
Take it. Trade it for what you can.

Id: [0x002C77D6]
Take it. Trade it for what you can.

Id: [0x002C77D7]
Already looking for another apprentice? All right, I'll bite. What do I do?

Id: [0x002C77D8]
Already looking for another apprentice? All right, I'll bite. What do I do?

Id: [0x002C77DA]
There you are, Gunnar. And with a smile like I haven't seen in some time.

Id: [0x002C77DB]
There you are, Gunnar. And with a smile like I haven't seen in some time.

Id: [0x002C77E3]
Gunnar? [grunts]Damn deserter.

Id: [0x002C77E4]
Gunnar? [grunts]Damn deserter.

Id: [0x002C77E5]
Are we anywhere close? Clee Hill Spring! We seem to be wandering stupidly.

Id: [0x002C77E6]
O, god. You're lost, aren't you? We're nowhere near Clee Hill Spring, right? I knew this was a mistake.

Id: [0x002C77E9]
O, you do revel in rendering me a foolish mess. I thought you might be cross with me, with how your last visit ended.

Id: [0x002C77EB]
A warm heart is welcome. And what of your other parts? Do I warm them as well?

Id: [0x002C77EC]
A warm heart is welcome. And what of your other parts? Do I warm them as well?

Id: [0x002C77F2]
Ah … now I feel twice the fool.

Id: [0x002C77F3]
I am only teasing, Tewdwr, and would not want to lead you to believe otherwise.

Id: [0x002C77F4]

Holding two sides of the river together is no easy task. Makes me respect Cynon's composure.

Id: [0x002C780C]
Use your cloak to obscure your face. Blend into the crowd, divert attention, hide in plain sight.

Id: [0x002C7819]
You have just won your heart's desire, Eivor. Yet by the look on your face, you have lost your will to live.

Id: [0x002C781D]
Otta! Otta! He's the Hammer of Stones! The Rocker of Rocks! The one sent by God for the good of our lands!

Id: [0x002C781E]
I love you, Otta! Smack those rocks!

Id: [0x002C781F]
It feels like he can hit it higher than the sun! Right through the sun and into God's hands!

Id: [0x002C7829]
It was not the time to act on what I felt. Now it is.

Id: [0x002C782A]
It was not the time to act on what I felt. Now it is.

Id: [0x002C782C]
O, my…

Id: [0x002C782E]
No. I've been kidnapped, beaten, and almost sacrificed to an old god. Does that qualify me to court a Dane?

Id: [0x002C782F]
Does that frighten you?

Id: [0x002C7830]
Does that frighten you?

Id: [0x002C7831]
Who is that man?

Id: [0x002C783A]
Is there a patch of Glowecestre away from prying eyes?

I have been eight days at sea without a drop of blood to whet my axe. So spare the chatter, bacraut (asshole), and draw your weapon.

Id: [0x002C7844]
What? Who said that?

Id: [0x002C7849]
Yes. And the cost of disrespect is death. You said it yourself.

Id: [0x002C784C]
Does it? You killed him all the same.

Id: [0x002C784F]
What is the true cost of disrespect? The choice lies with you.

Id: [0x002C7851]
It's been a kind and uneventful spring of my service. The druid, Halewyn, says the gods are smiling on me. All of them.

Id: [0x002C7853]
After the effort it took to crown you, it's good to see smooth waters and stiff sails.

Wolves thinned our flocks my first moon as ealdorman. Then blight visited our remaining crops. Poor omens of my own rule.

Id: [0x002C7859]
That will be trouble come winter.

Id: [0x002C785A]
That will be trouble come winter.

Id: [0x002C785C]
And how is Glowecestre?

Id: [0x002C785D]
And how is Glowecestre?

Id: [0x002C785E]
[scoff]I'm right here before you.

Id: [0x002C785F]
Do you mock me? I'm blind!

Id: [0x002C7860]
Ah. Sincere apologies. I did not realize.

Id: [0x002C7862]
Alas, my legs are afflicted. I cannot stand.

Id: [0x002C7863]
What good are you? A heap on the ground!

Id: [0x002C787A]
Go to your homes!

Id: [0x002C787B]
Go to your homes!

Id: [0x002C787C]
Dag accused me of betrayal. He accused me of breaking my oath. And this, this is the answer I gave him!

Id: [0x002C787D]
Dag accused me of betrayal. He accused me of breaking my oath. And this, this is the answer I gave him!

Id: [0x002C7884]
In fact, I am looking for someone to lead my crew.

Id: [0x002C788E]
But, enough of that. You deserve a diverting evening of friendship. Come, I've something to show you.

Id: [0x002C7892]
God's country this, but more than that. My soul's retreat. Reminding me why I took on the burden.

Id: [0x002C7894]
I used to run from home. It felt too small for me. But now I enjoy my wanderings for other reasons.

Id: [0x002C7896]
R-Rowan, that's right. I'm a stable hand, that's all. I keep horses and … well, I did. 'Til those brigands sold them off.

Id: [0x002C7958]
Different paths have led us here, but you are a force of nature. Like the sun. I am a timid creature, lucky to bask in your warmth.

Id: [0x002C795A]
I've composed a verse or two about it if you'd like to hear what--

Id: [0x002C7967]
My God. That was … dare I say it? Divine. I was right to wait.

Id: [0x002C7969]
You're the first I've given myself to, Eivor. I always promised that it would be with someone who filled my heart and soul.

Id: [0x002C796D]
Wait for what?

Id: [0x002C796E]
Wait for what?

Id: [0x002C7975]
God be praised! We were lambs before their blades, ready for slaughter.

Id: [0x002C7978]
You draw breath still.

Id: [0x002C7979]
You draw breath still.

Id: [0x002C7980]
Then we will too. Oswald drew first blood taking Rued down. We will finish what he started.

Id: [0x002C7984]
Theotford will rise. And Northwic. And Elmenham.

Id: [0x002C7985]

Wulfhilda, be still. Something stirs.

Shut your hole, shit-stain.

Rued's wretches spared you. You're lucky.

Id: [0x002C79AC]
Rued's wretches spared you. You're lucky.

Id: [0x002C79B3]
With these numbers? Are you keen to see Valhalla today?

Id: [0x002C79BA]
We might muster for an attack in the woods east of Portcestre, but there are scouts between there and here.

Id: [0x002C79BB]
That is a rash gamble, Raven-Feeder. If we are spotted, we will be vulnerable.

Id: [0x002C79BD]
You had better be all they promised.

Id: [0x002C79C0]
We cannot wait for them. We march as soon as we are able.

Id: [0x002C79C1]
We cannot wait for them. We march as soon as we're able.

Id: [0x002C79DF]
If she is allowed to dig in at Portcestre, it might be months before we can get Sigurd out.

Id: [0x002C79E3]
I say your haste has put us squarely in the shit.

Id: [0x002C79E4]
Do you still say I am reckless in my haste, Guthrum?

Id: [0x002C79E5]
Do you still say I am reckless in my haste, Guthrum?

Id: [0x002C79E6]
Saxons! Saxons from the west!

Id: [0x002C79E7]
Fulke was forewarned! There must have been more scouts than we knew of.

Id: [0x002C79F7]
You know the people of this isle better than I, Stowe. I trust you.

Id: [0x002C79F8]
You know the people of this isle better than I, Stowe. I trust you.

Id: [0x002C79F9]
No blame stains you, Eivor. He cut his own path. Always did.

Id: [0x002C79FA]
For him there is no more strife and pain. Only glorious battle, and the forever-feast.

Id: [0x002C79FB]
He was always quicker than me. Beat me out of the womb by mere moments. Now he has beat me to Valhalla.

Id: [0x002C79FC]
Even in death, he had to be first.

Id: [0x002C79FE]
What I would give to be there when he appears in Odin's hall. Old One-Eye will have his hands full tonight.

Id: [0x002C7A04]
I am.

Id: [0x002C7A05]
I am.

Id: [0x002C7A06]
Then you will get no help from me or any of the other merchants for that matter. Now if you don't mind.

Id: [0x002C7A08]
You want your jarl back, you must be cold as frost. Bravery is your enemy as often as your friend.

Id: [0x002C7A09]
We do not dash ourselves against hopeless causes. We arrive unexpected, strike swift.

Id: [0x002C7A0A]
Gather your allies. Pick your moment. Then, and only then … you crush them.

Id: [0x002C7A0B]
She sounded funny, so I asked her once. Hope it wasn't rude of me.

Id: [0x002C7A0D]
My thanks.

Id: [0x002C7A0E]
My thanks.

Id: [0x002C7A0F]
Is it also true that King Harald has declared a ban on raiding?

Id: [0x002C7A11]
No raiding, no fighting … soon we will be softer than Christians.

Id: [0x002C7A12]
Sounds like something he would say. He rules all of Norway now. It is not in his interest to see fighting amongst his clans.

This bacraut was stirring up shit. Yelling to the rafters how he meant harm to King Harald.

See it from our view, friend. People are upset. They need time to get used to this sudden change.

You will join my pile of bones.

Id: [0x002C7A44]
Ah! Then plug your ears, you stinking whale shit!

Id: [0x002C7A47]
You demon-plowing dog!

Id: [0x002C7A4E]
Now my blood screams.

Id: [0x002C7A50]
A greater darkness fuels my rage.

Id: [0x002C7A51]
Spirit of my father's rage, fill me!

Id: [0x002C7BB6]
So, the cow pulls itself free and careers down the road dragging the banner behind it.

Id: [0x002C7BB8]
Quite the spirited creature. You gave chase?

Id: [0x002C7BB9]
Quite the spirited creature. You gave chase?

Id: [0x002C7BBB]
Uh? You'll what?

Id: [0x002C7BBE]
A few hard thumps should knock some sense into him.

Id: [0x002C7BBF]
A few hard thumps should knock some sense into him.

Id: [0x002C7BFC]
Gods, is this real? Huh. I might detain a few more of your friends for this price.

Id: [0x002C7C00]
Two-thousand? That is as good as robbery. Name something fair.

Id: [0x002C7C01]
Two-thousand? That is as good as robbery. Name something fair.

Id: [0x002C7C02]
Wasting my time. Now piss off.

Id: [0x002C7C03]
I know, I know. I only ask out of impatience.

Id: [0x002C7C05]
Damn near robbery, but a deal is a deal. Take your silver and let him go.

Id: [0x002C7C06]
Damn near robbery, but a deal is a deal. Take your silver and let him go.

Id: [0x002C7C27]
On foot! Almost all the way to Halewyn's cabin. [laughs]And then again, I looked the fool when they followed on horses.

Id: [0x002C7C30]
I am. The king wishes to make a survey of the land he now rules. Nothing more.

Id: [0x002C7C32]
No. My family has lived under his banner since the days of his father, Halfdan the Black.

Id: [0x002C7C36]
Are you one of Harald's men?

Id: [0x002C7C37]
Are you one of Harald's men?

Id: [0x002C7C38]
Let me ask, are you one of the conquered? Did Harald take your lands as well?

Id: [0x002C7C39]
Let me ask, are you one of the conquered? Did Harald take your lands as well?

Id: [0x002C7C3A]
Well, welcome to Fornburg, warrior.

Id: [0x002C7C3B]
Well, welcome to Fornburg, warrior.

Id: [0x002C7C80]
I meet nothing but village idiots. Why do you speak from the ground? Stand up and greet me proper.

Id: [0x002C7C81]
I'm a dockmaster. Being inquisitive befits my line of work. Keeps things under control.

Id: [0x002C7C84]
You'll find no trouble here unless you seek it. I only want to speak with some old friends.

Id: [0x002C7C85]
You'll find no trouble here unless you seek it. I only want to speak with some old friends.

Id: [0x002C7C88]
It does not surprise me. They are driven. And so am I. Now, I would like to see them again.

Id: [0x002C7C89]
It does not surprise me. They are driven. And so am I. Now, I would like to see them again.

Id: [0x002C7C97]
I can see that I have done little good. I'll leave you two here to argue.

Id: [0x002C7C98]
I can see that I have done little good. I'll leave you two here to argue.

Id: [0x002C7C99]
I see a way you can help one another.

Id: [0x002C7C9A]
I see a way you can help one another.

Id: [0x002C7C9B]
I've brought you both here. It's your decision what happens next.

Id: [0x002C7C9C]
I've brought you both here. It's your decision what happens next.

Id: [0x002C7CA4]
Would you please stick a cork in it for two minutes!

Id: [0x002C7CA5]
Ah! Heaven-sent joy! [to Eivor]O! All because of this Dane! Thank you, stranger.

Id: [0x002C7CA6]
Good riddance, too!

Id: [0x002C7CAF]
Wait … I have more poems to arose your skaldic heart. Only give me time to gather them and--

Id: [0x002C7CB2]
Some passions are fleeting, and for that they are all the sweeter.

Id: [0x002C7CB3]
Some passions are fleeting, and for that they are all the sweeter.

Id: [0x002C7CB4]
Tewdwr, thank you. For all this. It was lovely … you are lovely. But I must go.

Id: [0x002C7CB5]
Tewdwr, thank you. For all this. It was lovely … you are lovely. But I must go.

Id: [0x002C7CB8]
Quite bold in those bindings. I like your spirit.

Id: [0x002C7CB9]
Quite bold in those bindings. I like your spirit.

Id: [0x002C7CBB]
Eivor, may I ask? What is it that you seek forgiveness for?

Id: [0x002C7CBD]
I was raised to be a priest, Eivor. So I know what a troubled face looks like.

Id: [0x002C7CBF]
What mistake?

Id: [0x002C7CC1]
Hm?

Id: [0x002C7CC2]
Hm?

Id: [0x002C7CC3]
I made a mistake. Many mistakes, that rolled together like snow-thunder.

Id: [0x002C7CC4]

I would rather not say. There is nothing to be gained by gawking at a weeping wound.

Id: [0x002C7CE1]
Unbind them.

Id: [0x002C7CE4]
Both of you are free to go, but more than welcome to stay, if you are willing to pull your weight.

Id: [0x002C7D1F]
Can anyone hear my cries? Please help! This brute has me trapped in this sultry tower.

Id: [0x002C7D20]
I'm trapped! With no means of escape. So helpless. O, I need someone, anyone!

Id: [0x002C7D4F]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002C7D58]
With Kjotve dead, will you return to the south?

Id: [0x002C7D59]
With Kjotve dead, will you return to the south?

Id: [0x002C7D61]
Get some rest before you set out, then. Injured men do not fare well on the open ocean.

Id: [0x002C7D62]
Get some rest before you set out, then. Injured men do not fare well on the open ocean.

Id: [0x002C7D82]
Money? You offend me. I am an artist, grubby coin does not sustain me. Poetry is my bread and mead.

Id: [0x002C7D84]
I cannot, for walking in your footsteps has let me sup at the cup of inspiration. You are my life's great purpose.

Id: [0x002C7D86]
A piffling sum. But I will take it. Aswig, you will have bread and milk for sup tonight. It is surely a day amongst days.

Id: [0x002C7D89]
First there was a famine and now, look here, a feast! Fare thee well, Eivor of the Raven Clan. Your exploits will live on in me.

Id: [0x002C7D8A]
I won't give you any money, if that is what you seek.

Id: [0x002C7D8B]
I won't give you any money, if that is what you seek.

Id: [0x002C7D8C]
Enough. Stop following me.

Id: [0x002C7D8D]
Enough. Stop following me.

Id: [0x002C7D8E]
Enough with you.

Id: [0x002C7D8F]
Enough with you.

Id: [0x002C7D90]
Enough! I won't listen to your blabber anymore.

Id: [0x002C7D91]
Enough! I won't listen to your blabber anymore.

Id: [0x002C7D92]
Eivor, like a golden eel, breaks the river's watery seal.

Id: [0x002C7D93]
Brave, good Eivor swims and swims. Swims and swims and swims with vim.

Id: [0x002C7D94]
Eivor is walking like a duck! It's like she doesn't give a … fa-la-la-la and nonny nonny noo.

Id: [0x002C7D96]
Eivor like a mountain goat! Toss your hero half a groat.

Id: [0x002C7D97]
Eivor climbing like a spider! O, I'm honored to be beside her.

Id: [0x002C7D98]
Eivor, skulking in the shadow, meek and quiet as a sparrow.

Id: [0x002C7D9A]
Eivor, forgetting how to dance, takes an arrow in the arse.

Id: [0x002C7D9B]
Just a tiny scratch is all. Eivor will but walk it off!

Id: [0x002C7D9D]
Fleet of foot and long of gait, O Eivor, do I prate your fate.

Id: [0x002C7D9E]
Eivor charges up her bow! Watch that arrow go and go!

Id: [0x002C7D9F]
O'er hill dear arrow fly. Rain down death from up on high.

Id: [0x002C7DA0]
Eivor ran into the fray. None of you will survive the day.

Id: [0x002C7DA1]
Eivor gives the Saxons grief. Hack and slash them, break their teeth!

Id: [0x002C7DA3]
Ubba will not have died in vain.

Id: [0x002C7DA4]
I follow you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C7DA5]
Then the night of the feast, under cover of darkness. That is when we will strike.

Id: [0x002C7DA6]

Harald may be young, but he is clever. Do not underestimate him. He came of age very quickly.

Id: [0x002C7E29]
Mercia, East Anglia, Northumbria, and Wessex.

Id: [0x002C7E2C]
My scouts will soon tell me if I am correct.

Id: [0x002C7E2F]
How I miss those days! Ransacking and pillaging, blades singing and shields splintering.

Id: [0x002C7E31]
I would ask you to join us, but you are the only blacksmith we have. We cannot afford your loss.

Id: [0x002C7E32]
I would ask you to join us, but you are the only blacksmith we have. We cannot afford your loss.

Id: [0x002C7E36]
Should we be so lucky.

Id: [0x002C7E37]
Should we be so lucky.

Id: [0x002C7E39]
It is not as obscured as I would have hoped. But I am certain you will fashion something workable from this wreckage.

Id: [0x002C7E3B]
Randvi.

Id: [0x002C7E3C]
Randvi.

Id: [0x002C7E47]
Is that true?

Id: [0x002C7E48]
Is that true?

Id: [0x002C7E4A]
I can come now. I only need a horse.

Id: [0x002C7E4B]
I can come now. I only need a horse.

Id: [0x002C7E4C]
Apart from growing this settlement, you must seek out alliances as well. We cannot pacify England with so few friends.

Id: [0x002C7E5D]
You look like reddened shit. What happened?

Id: [0x002C7E5F]
Nothing to crow about, except to say the men who delayed us are dead. And how are you?

Id: [0x002C7E60]
Nothing to crow about, except to say the men who delayed us are dead. And how are you?

Id: [0x002C7E64]
He is still with the emissary from the North. I would wait a while longer.

Id: [0x002C7E78]
A legend, a hero of the people, and the richest merchant west of the Indus! You look upon … Reda!

Id: [0x002C7E85]
From time to time, yes. He speaks to me as well, but … it feels mad to say such things aloud.

Id: [0x002C7E86]
From time to time, yes. He speaks to me as well, but … it feels mad to say such things aloud.

Id: [0x002C7E87]
I understand.

Id: [0x002C7E89]
Salve, Eivor! Ad meliora! (Towards better things!)

Id: [0x002C7E8B]
And who is that fellow?

Id: [0x002C7E8E]
Good day!

Id: [0x002C7E8F]
Good day!

Id: [0x002C7E93]
Put this one to honest work, that is what I like to see!

Id: [0x002C7E97]
I may know a way to clarify these visions. An elixir that may open the door of your mind into the realm of the gods.

Id: [0x002C7E98]
Valka, please…

Id: [0x002C7E99]
Valka, please…

Id: [0x002C7E9C]
No. My clan will not be forgotten!

Id: [0x002C7E9D]
No. My clan will not be forgotten!

Id: [0x002C7EA6]
You have won your prize, Wolf-Kissed. The glory of my death.

Id: [0x002C7EAB]
All for this…

Id: [0x002C7EAE]
…your coward father and his empty sacrifice.

Id: [0x002C7EB0]
Heed the price of our war, Wolf-Kissed. The harvest of three dead generations. All their names, unknown. It all means nothing.

Id: [0x002C7EB2]
I fought as I did, as hard as I did, to survive. For I know what awaits us in the end.

Id: [0x002C7EB4]
Only darkness.

Id: [0x002C7EB7]
Odin?

Id: [0x002C7EB8]
Odin?

Id: [0x002C7EB9]
What do you want of me?

Id: [0x002C7EBA]
What do you want of me?

Id: [0x002C7EC0]
I call a holmgang (duel)! Here against the oath-breaker.

Id: [0x002C7EC1]
I call a holmgang (duel)! Here against the oath-breaker.

Id: [0x002C7EF2]
Now, if the talking is done, there's blood to be spilled!

Id: [0x002C7EF3]
Eivor. Dark news. We found a letter on one of the dead. Fulke has called for aid.

Id: [0x002C7EF5]
A Saxon army marches from Wincestre.

Id: [0x002C7EF6]
We may begin the assault at once. Or you might wish to speak with your allies if you have not done so already?

Id: [0x002C7EF9]
Reinforcements?

Id: [0x002C7EFA]
Reinforcements?

Id: [0x002C7F0F]
Parting is a sorrow that fills my cup to overflowing.

Id: [0x002C7F10]
Eivor ran away, away. Bravely ran away, away.

Id: [0x002C7F11]
At last I can continue my epic tale of your exploits. It was just getting good.

Id: [0x002C7F12]
My muse returns!

Id: [0x002C7F13]
Eivor the fleet of foot, the sharp of blade. You have returned. Let us again make lasting memories!

Id: [0x002C7F15]
Hello? O brave protector. Have you come to claim my hand?

Id: [0x002C7F19]
It is for her. It is all for her, so she will finally notice me.

Id: [0x002C7F1B]
If I'd have known it was that easy…

Id: [0x002C7F1C]
Aethelflaed? What do you say to the sweet boy?

Id: [0x002C7F22]
You'd have done it yourself. Risked life and limb. But great men know the value of a champion.

Id: [0x002C7F23]

Id: [0x002C7F28]
Jump, little flea! Jump, flea! Jump!

Id: [0x002C7F29]
He's going to fall. O, my days, I can't look.

Id: [0x002C7F2A]
Go on, Esobert! It's yours for the taking!

Id: [0x002C7F2B]
Saints alive! Did you see that? God sent Esobert an angel!

Id: [0x002C7F2C]
Is it over? Did he fall? God's buttered crumpets, I never told him I loved him.

Id: [0x002C7F2D]
That stranger got it for him. Oi, that's cheating!

Id: [0x002C7F40]
Noah's holy cattle! You actually gave a flower to the princess!

Id: [0x002C7F41]
And now we are betrothed.

Id: [0x002C7F42]
Takes more than that. There's holding hands and grunting. And then sometimes praying… "O, God! O, God".

Id: [0x002C7F43]
King Esobert the first. The Flea of Wincestre!

Id: [0x002C7F45]
Perhaps some pretty flowers will get her to open the door.

Guthrum spoke in anger, but there is wisdom in what he says.

Id: [0x002C7F5E]
I have unlocked the door, kind stranger. You are welcome to come in.

A scout patrols the river bank north of Crawleah.

Id: [0x002C7F76]
Erke, Stowe, Ljufvina, ride there ahead of me. Together we will bring them down.

Good. I will join you after I've dealt with the Saxon camp.

Id: [0x002C7F7A]
Good. I will join you after I've dealt with the Saxon camp.

Id: [0x002C7F81]
Wonderful, your wit sparkles! But still … another one.

Id: [0x002C7F82]
I saw a strange thing, wonderful of shape, singing in a tavern. Its beak underneath, stood upon splayed legs that cannot walk.

Id: [0x002C7F84]
They may choose not to walk, but walk they can. Wrong, my friend. Let us try one more.

Id: [0x002C7F87]
Very good! A tricky one, that few but the sharpest needles can sew. Now, the final test.

Id: [0x002C7F88]
With my roof of tears, I am driven far and wide on my avenging path. When I shake the forest, I rumble the fruit from the trees.

Id: [0x002C7F8A]
But do such things sing? Have a beak? No. Perhaps the last one will be easier to fathom.

Id: [0x002C7F8D]
Ah, but when has a giant stood beneath a roof of water? Perhaps you are not up to the challenge.

Id: [0x002C7F90]
Ha! A tragically romantic guess that speaks much of you. But no… that is not the right answer.

Id: [0x002C7F93]
You are brighter than the sky-lantern!

Id: [0x002C7F94]
Birds sing and have beaks? And fly rather than walk.

Id: [0x002C7F95]
Birds sing and have beaks? And fly rather than walk.

Id: [0x002C7F96]
Something that sings? A musical instrument? The bladder that whines and wheezes through pipes? Bagpipes!

It brings me no pleasure to fight my own people, but a debt is a debt.

Id: [0x002C7F9F]
Besides, they're men of Wessex, Aelfred's folk. No brothers of yours.

Id: [0x002C7FA0]
We will set off immediately. Together we will fall upon them as Thor's hammer.

Id: [0x002C8004]
Who dares to challenge the great Mildburg, given fleety-feet by God himself?

Id: [0x002C8005]
Many have tried, none have beaten me. For God kissed my feet when I was a babe and made me swifter than a swallow.

Id: [0x002C8006]
Come on! Someone must be brave enough to challenge me?

Id: [0x002C800A]
You would be, too, if you had miracle legs.

Id: [0x002C800C]
Looks can be deceiving. Have you heard of the great Pheidippides? The mighty hero of old?

Id: [0x002C800D]
Ran all the way from Marathon to tell the king they won the battle. Then guess what happened? He only fell down dead!

Id: [0x002C800E]
It was very far.[beat] Girls can't fight, it's the rules. But like Pheidippides, I am going to be the fastest messenger who ever lived.

Id: [0x002C801B]
You are pretty cocksure for a child.

So when the Norse defeat the Saxon armies, you'll quickly bear the bad news to your king?

Id: [0x002C803A]
Gladly. And I don't care whether you give it to Cedric or not. He has all the finesse of a mad cow in bloomers.

Id: [0x002C803D]
Jesus wept upon the Holy Cross. Fuck off the both of you. Aelfred will get the jewel when I get what I'm owed.

Id: [0x002C803F]
Sorry, my beef is not with you. I only ask for what coin is fair. It cost me double to make over what was agreed. I have a wife to feed.

Id: [0x002C8047]
If the jewel belongs to Aelfred, then on your life, you'd be wise to deliver it for the agreed price.

Id: [0x002C8058]
Well, I didn't ask for your help, but I am glad of it. Aelfred commissioned this rare thing.

Id: [0x002C805A]
And I have to tell the king I let a Dane steal his gift to his wife?

Id: [0x002C805B]
I am.

Id: [0x002C805C]
I am.

Id: [0x002C805F]
And here's another God sent to shit in my stewpot. Sod off unless you are going to magic Aelfred's jewel out your arse.

In Lunden, they now operate without restraint. If you were to eradicate them, the city would be in your debt.

Well, if your work benefits us, I will see that you keep it, for as long as you live among us.

Eradicate them where they are strongest and the alliances you seek will be far easier to come by.

Id: [0x002C8072]
It does, I am afraid. There is a pain in my chest for which I have no remedy.

Id: [0x002C8074]
Of course. Though I am reluctant to displease my mentor.

I hear a heaviness to your breathing, Hytham. Does your wound still trouble you?

Forgive my jest. This gift we call a Leap of Faith. It is one of our Brotherhood's most sacred rites.

Id: [0x002C8081]
I will leap first. On my word, you must follow. Lean into your faith, into your strength, and take flight.

Id: [0x002C8083]
Yes.

Id: [0x002C8086]
Wait. And watch.

You want me to jump. From here.

Now a jarl may be a chief, a leader, or a man with broad wealth and influence.

Right.

We are nearly there.

Id: [0x002C810E]
By God's hairy balls, you are a thief and a swindler! Give me the jewel Aelfred commissioned.

Id: [0x002C8110]
I'll wear your guts as a hat. Give me Aelfred's jewel, you damn scoundrel. We have already paid for it.

Id: [0x002C8111]
Oi, get out of it, you!

Id: [0x002C8112]
No! Come back! I can pay, I can pay a lot.

Id: [0x002C8125]
We could have handled this in a more civil manner!

Id: [0x002C8126]
Too late for that.

Id: [0x002C8129]
Need some help, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002C812A]
Could we not have talked to them first?

Id: [0x002C812C]
This way is quicker. The dead don't argue.

The camp is ours!

For a town of farmers and shepherds, this place bristles with swords.

Id: [0x002C813D]
One of them is a thegn by his dress. Serious men with him too. Went into the longhouse.

Is it over? I was just working up a sweat.

Bandits, taking advantage of the disorder in Suthsexe to fill their pockets. Odin smiles on us today.

We could charge in while they are distracted, but it would be safer to use fire arrows.

Id: [0x002C815B]
Lead and I will follow.

Id: [0x002C815D]
A sound decision. I agree.

Eivor, I beg you. Aelfred's men or not, they are Saxons and Christians. If I could speak to them, we might avoid bloodshed.

Id: [0x002C81E9]
It's been six weeks … six weeks since he's gone to Lincoln in search of work.

Id: [0x002C81EA]
And still no return.

Id: [0x002C81EB]
And still no return.

Id: [0x002C81ED]
Thank you, Eivor. I will do what I can.

Id: [0x002C81EE]
And lose the element of surprise. These people make their living by the blade. We should attack headlong.

Hear me, all! I challenge Eivor for the leadership of this clan until Sigurd is safe home!

No. We fight to the death.

You all die here today!

You flatter me, lord. I only wish to help.

How can I help?

Id: [0x002C827C]
Is there place for us on your ship? I could use a change of horizon.

No, but it may not matter. Most of us are leaving. For England. To start anew.

You could not even begin to imagine the thing I've seen. What I've learned.

Born of gods, is who I am. A Lord of War! A Roman Mars! I know who I am, I know my destiny! And you will not hinder me!

Forgive me, I am faint. Tired of the day and all that has passed.

Right. Your lover from afar.

Stand ready, Eivor. When they see us, they will charge. We must defend the men.

Move in! We take the fight to the enemy!

Id: [0x002C8396]
When danger rears its ugly head, Eivor balks and just stops dead.

This will not make great poetry, Eivor. Do something. Anything.

No! I want to live! And I could not possibly hope to win against you.

Id: [0x002C83C8]
But maybe you could lead me to a victory?

Id: [0x002C83C9]
Yes, yes! That could work! I could add a few details, nothing too exaggerated. Skalds do it all the time.

Id: [0x002C848D]
Eivor. What has happened? What have you seen?

Id: [0x002C848F]
Hm, yes, that can happen. Return when you are rested and we will try again.

Id: [0x002C8490]
Stranger things yet. But … something took me out of it, pulled me away.

Id: [0x002C8491]
Stranger things yet. But … something took me out of it, pulled me away.

Id: [0x002C8493]
But Sigurd is so much more. I gave him that understanding, that gift.

Id: [0x002C8495]
Yes! To awaken him!

Id: [0x002C8496]
Behold his terrible beauty!

Id: [0x002C8497]
You gave him pain!

Id: [0x002C8498]
You gave him pain!

Id: [0x002C84A0]
Eivor, you have awakened. With more to share I hope.

Id: [0x002C84A2]
And what did you see?

Id: [0x002C84A4]
Odin has seen fit to gift you with his infinite knowledge, and the treasure of his experience.

Id: [0x002C84A7]
You visit lore and legend. Things I would never have imagined to be real. Parables, yet here you live them as memories.

Id: [0x002C84A9]
This is wonderful. Was there more?

Id: [0x002C84B2]
How curious… Was there more?

Id: [0x002C84B8]
I returned to Asgard.

Id: [0x002C84B9]
I returned to Asgard.

Id: [0x002C84BA]
I can make sense of no more.

Id: [0x002C84BB]
I can make sense of no more.

Id: [0x002C84BC]
I bound the wolf Fenrir, Loki's son, with an unbreakable cord.

Id: [0x002C84BD]
I bound the wolf Fenrir, Loki's son, with an unbreakable cord.

Id: [0x002C84BE]
The beast was enraged by my actions. We fought and I prevailed, but I could not kill the beast.

Id: [0x002C84BF]
The beast was enraged by my actions. We fought and I prevailed, but I could not kill the beast.

Id: [0x002C84C0]
Every moment there was as tactile and as vital as you and I seated in this hut.

Id: [0x002C84C1]
Every moment there was as tactile and as vital as you and I seated in this hut.

Id: [0x002C84CA]
I witnessed a final vision from the Nornir. The coming of Ragnarok.

Id: [0x002C84CB]
I witnessed a final vision from the Nornir. The coming of Ragnarok.

Id: [0x002C84D0]
Where is this other priest?

Id: [0x002C84D1]
Where is this other priest?

Id: [0x002C84DB]
All this sneaking about is giving me a cramp in my arse.

Id: [0x002C84DD]
Hiding like field mice. It is not our way.

Id: [0x002C84DF]
Can we not just kill the lot of them?

Id: [0x002C84E1]
It is hard to be quiet with you complaining.

Id: [0x002C84E2]
It is hard to be quiet with you complaining.

Id: [0x002C84E3]
We are not hiding like field mice. We are stalking like lynxes.

Id: [0x002C84E4]
We are not hiding like field mice. We are stalking like lynxes.

Id: [0x002C84E5]
Do it my way first.

Id: [0x002C84E6]
Do it my way first.

Id: [0x002C84EB]
Danes are crawling all over Suthsexe! We must bolster the fyrds. Recruit more soldiers!

Id: [0x002C84EC]
The king's already pulled every able man into his service. Scanty pickings out there.

Id: [0x002C84ED]
They ain't proper soldiers, either. Farmers and tradesmen. The last showed up with hayforks and shovels!

Id: [0x002C84EE]
I don't want excuses. I need more men!

Id: [0x002C84EF]
Not if I get there first, slow-arse!

Id: [0x002C84F2]
Little do they dream how close we have come already.

Id: [0x002C84F3]
Little do they dream how close we have come already.

Id: [0x002C84F4]
Fell the swine!

Id: [0x002C84F5]
Whew, that was close.

Id: [0x002C84F6]
Danes! The Danes have come! Call the thegn!

Id: [0x002C84F8]
Thank Odin for that! I am sick of skulking around. Now where's the big man?

Id: [0x002C84F9]
They spotted us.

Id: [0x002C84FA]
They spotted us.

Id: [0x002C84FB]
Rats in the wheat fields? Not on my watch.

Id: [0x002C84FF]
The elixir is ready. It will taste like misery itself, but it will open your mind to the sights and sounds of the nine worlds.

Id: [0x002C8507]
All that power! All that potential, locked away!

Id: [0x002C8513]
I think she's quite fond of you.

Id: [0x002C8514]
I think she's quite fond of you.

Id: [0x002C8518]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002C8519]
Eivor! Help me!

Id: [0x002C851B]
I'm coming!

Id: [0x002C851C]
I'm coming!

Id: [0x002C851D]
They are perfect companions. And very kind.

Id: [0x002C851E]
My mother always told me to avoid wild animals. Shows what she knows!

Id: [0x002C8520]
How about we think quietly on what we have learned. Just until we get home.

Id: [0x002C8521]
How about we think quietly on what we have learned. Just until we get home.

Id: [0x002C8523]
Don't try and stop me. I will get that flower … and then she'll see how much I love her.

Id: [0x002C8525]
I am just getting my breath back. The climb was hard. I'm girding my erm … loins…[NO LOC CHANGE NEEDED]

Id: [0x002C8527]
I mean, if you insist. But I could get it if I wanted to. Just so you know.

Id: [0x002C852C]
A brave choice, little fellow.

Id: [0x002C852D]
A brave choice, little fellow.

Id: [0x002C8533]
No more holding back. Let us take this fight to the Saxons.

Id: [0x002C8534]
Archers, move in! We shall burn this town to cinders!

Id: [0x002C8537]
We cannot leave the archers undefended!

Id: [0x002C8539]
The best defense is to attack! Go! Get in their teeth!

Id: [0x002C853A]
The best defense is to attack! Go! Get in their teeth!

Id: [0x002C853B]
He was betrayed and murdered. By those who denied his friendship, just as you deny him now!

Id: [0x002C853D]
[cough]Hold there, I am not your enemy!

Id: [0x002C853E]
[cough]Hold there, I am not your enemy!

Id: [0x002C8541]
A scream I shall quiet.

Id: [0x002C8542]
A scream I shall quiet.

Id: [0x002C8544]
The rest of the letter is burnt, but makes mention of the minster and the abbess. Is that where she has been keeping these texts?

Id: [0x002C8545]
The rest of the letter is burnt, but makes mention of the minster and the abbess. Is that where she has been keeping these texts?

Id: [0x002C8546]
I was to be Lady of Mercia!

Id: [0x002C856C]
Take me to them.

Id: [0x002C856D]
Take me to them.

Id: [0x002C856E]
Who is the most gorgeous girl? You are, yes you are. Snuffling through the leaves, making daddy a fortune!

Id: [0x002C856F]
Good girl, Lady Trotters, good girl.

Id: [0x002C8571]
Where he's meant to be.

Id: [0x002C8572]
Where he is meant to be.

Id: [0x002C8580]
Pig? You ignoramus. Lady Trotters is a hog. And the most unique and singular beauty.

Id: [0x002C8583]
Please do, and not for the reasons you are insinuating. You are confusing her delicate nose with your earthy stench.

Id: [0x002C8585]
Mushrooms? [ONO Pfff]She sniffs out treasure.

Id: [0x002C8586]
Nice pig.

Id: [0x002C8587]
Nice pig.

Id: [0x002C8588]
Should I leave you two alone?

Id: [0x002C8589]
Should I leave you two alone?

Id: [0x002C858A]
Some like my smell.[beat] So she's a mushroom hog? I have heard of such rare beasts.

Id: [0x002C858B]
Some like my smell.[beat] So she's a mushroom hog? I have heard of such rare beasts.

Id: [0x002C858C]
There you go, my lovely. Find us riches and you shall have sweet red berries for supper!

Id: [0x002C858D]
[ONO Urgg]More rancid socks. Bandits leave them lying around and Lady is drawn to their unholy stench!

Id: [0x002C8595]
Away, curse-tusks. Return to the beastmaster and tell him I will not fall to the drum of your deviled hooves.

Id: [0x002C859C]
You have done us a great service! I will compose this day into song! Farewell.

Id: [0x002C859D]
Smack my bishop! Smack my bishop!

Id: [0x002C85A0]
A god trapped in a prison of bones! The pain was necessary to free him!

Id: [0x002C85A8]
She survived. But the Red Hand has been a growing problem here of late.

Id: [0x002C85A9]
She survived. But the Red Hand has been a growing problem here of late.

Id: [0x002C85AA]
I'll break into your house and piss on your wife!

Id: [0x002C85B0]
You are just a warmonger, you'd betray your own family!

Id: [0x002C85B1]
This is our home! We're not tourists.

Id: [0x002C85B2]
Take a breath, all that vitriol can kill a man!

Id: [0x002C85B3]
Now you have broken my flow! How can a man compose with you spewing in his ear?

Id: [0x002C85B5]
Hers was the great work, the highest achievement of humankind. Now you, Eivor - you must carry it forward.

Id: [0x002C85D3]
You drive me mad with snorting! I did not mean to snare the she-wolf. Tell him. Tell your master her blood is not on my hands.

Id: [0x002C85D5]
Fuck off.

Id: [0x002C85D6]
He has a loud mouth, usually stands right around here yawping. Hard to miss.

Id: [0x002C85D7]
He has a loud mouth, usually stands right around here yawping. Hard to miss.

Id: [0x002C85E7]
You're slower than a lumpfish.

Id: [0x002C85E9]
Ah! Great Pheidippides, give me speed![ONO Whooooosh!]

Id: [0x002C85EA]
Hey! God gives cheaters boils on their bums.

Id: [0x002C85F0]
No, I understand. You were well within your rights.

Id: [0x002C85F4]
All right. Once more…

Id: [0x002C85F5]
All right. Once more…

Id: [0x002C85F6]
I'm not stopping even if you do fall and break all your legs.

Id: [0x002C85F7]
No fair! You can't leave Wincestre… I win! I win!

Id: [0x002C85FC]
Now … Gudrun, what did you do upon discovering your sailcloth?

Id: [0x002C85FD]
Now … Gudrun, what did you do upon discovering your sailcloth?

Id: [0x002C85FE]
I wished to use it as a canvas, you see? As a conveyance for my latest works.

Id: [0x002C85FF]
The sailcloth was in such a state, and so obscured from view, I assumed it was refuse! Abandoned goods!

Id: [0x002C8600]
[scoff]Nonsense.

Id: [0x002C8601]
My only crime here is that I gave something ugly and decrepit a bold new life!

Id: [0x002C8604]
Are you finished singing, my dear skald?

Id: [0x002C8605]
You weaken the minds of children, and delude the minds of men.

Id: [0x002C8606]
Without rank, without order, without a chain of command, life cannot endure! Chaos will reign. Do you understand?

Id: [0x002C8607]
Of course, my jarl. As it must be. Forgive my defiance.

Id: [0x002C8609]
Thank you, lord, for hearing us out.

Id: [0x002C860F]
(sobbing)

Id: [0x002C8613]
Should the need arise again, do not fail to rouse me.

Id: [0x002C8615]
You see?

Id: [0x002C8617]
My thanks.

Id: [0x002C8618]
My thanks.

Id: [0x002C8621]
Sorry, who are you?

Id: [0x002C8622]
The dockmaster?

Id: [0x002C8623]
The dockmaster?

Id: [0x002C8629]
Stop!

Id: [0x002C862A]
Lower your weapons, this is madness!

Id: [0x002C862B]
Please. Please, both of you!

Id: [0x002C8636]
Someone who wants to do business. With Grigorii.

Id: [0x002C8637]
Someone who wants to do business. With Grigorii.

Id: [0x002C8638]
I don't know your face, and I've said too much already. Please go.

What good is a market if I cannot sniff around its stalls, eager to spend my gains?

Id: [0x002C8647]
What good is a market if I cannot sniff around its stalls, eager to spend my gains?

Id: [0x002C8649]
You want to let go of your silver? Try the narrow alleys. Now begone.

Id: [0x002C865B]
Welcome home.

Id: [0x002C8663]
Tove.

Id: [0x002C8664]
Tove.

Id: [0x002C8672]
Sit a moment … and rest.

Id: [0x002C8674]
For me.

Id: [0x002C867B]
What is this?

Id: [0x002C8680]
We missed a great feast, it seems.

Id: [0x002C8681]
We missed a great feast, it seems.

Id: [0x002C8684]
Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C8685]
Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C86C3]
I, ah…

Id: [0x002C86C4]
I, ah…

Id: [0x002C86D7]
(unintelligible)[Festival time!]

Id: [0x002C86E2]
For love and joy, words can jade. Our souls must sound in a heartful song. And when … no, no…

Id: [0x002C86E3]
For love and joy, words can jade. Our souls must sound in a heartful song. And when … no, no…

Id: [0x002C8706]
Thank you, Otta Sluggasson. This game is joyful. If you add a cup of mead and some popped oats, could be a fine manner of passing time.

Id: [0x002C8707]
Thank you, Otta Sluggasson. This game is joyful. If you add a cup of mead and some popped oats, could be a fine manner of passing time.

Id: [0x002C8708]
Eivor? Randvi? What is this? Is everything all right?

Id: [0x002C870C]
Our jarlskona has returned to lead us forward into an uncertain future.

Id: [0x002C870D]
Will you speak to your people?

Id: [0x002C8720]
You are less mine than I am yours. And I ask of you only this, keep me honest in the times to come.

Id: [0x002C8721]
You are less mine than I am yours. And I ask of you only this, keep me honest in the times to come.

Id: [0x002C8726]
The Dane's got a fine shot! Two legends here together! Tell the poets!

Id: [0x002C8727]
Walking unseen through hostile territory is an exercise in subtlety.

Id: [0x002C8728]
A hood makes you forgettable, dismissed at a distance.

Id: [0x002C8729]
Do not draw blade or hammer, for these and other sudden movements can break your disguise.

Id: [0x002C872B]
Gorm is there, in the camp ahead.

Id: [0x002C872E]
When we meet again, Eivor. May it be as friends.

Id: [0x002C8730]
It was your right to kill my brother for the violence he gave. But you condemned him to icy Hel for all time.

Id: [0x002C8731]
Goodbye, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002C8732]
It will.

Id: [0x002C8733]
It will.

Id: [0x002C8736]
Here you are. And be careful. This brew will feel as cold as ice on your lips, yet will burn like a fire in your belly.

Id: [0x002C873A]
Unless … Unless you lead me there. Dear Lord, yes! Walk loudly, friend. I'll follow wherever you go.

Id: [0x002C873D]
I could not keep him in line in this life. But I have no doubt the All-Father will put him to good use in the next.

Id: [0x002C873F]
Put it to good use Wolf-Kissed. And may we meet again soon. On a battlefield, if the fates are kind.

Id: [0x002C8743]
My brother! Ivarr! You banished him to Helheim! Denied him a seat in Odin's hall!

Id: [0x002C8745]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002C8746]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002C8747]
I cannot say I know what you mean.

Id: [0x002C8748]
I cannot say I know what you mean?

Id: [0x002C874C]
(unintelligible)[But no amount of scrying or foresight prepared me for the sweeping adventure of meeting you.]

Id: [0x002C875E]
Why do you cry out so much?

Id: [0x002C875F]
Why do you cry out so much?

Id: [0x002C8761]
They do.

Id: [0x002C8762]
They do.

Id: [0x002C8763]
It was never in his character to lead. It was always within yours.

Id: [0x002C8766]
Randvi, you and the people here have done more for me than I could ever repay.

Id: [0x002C8767]
Randvi, you and the people here have done more for me than I could ever repay.

Id: [0x002C8768]
I am honored by your faith in me. And your confidence.

Id: [0x002C8769]
I am honored by your faith in me. And your confidence.

Id: [0x002C876B]
But after we talked with honesty, we embraced more warmly than we have in a great while. I think we will be happy.

Id: [0x002C876C]
I am pleased for myself. Sigurd's desires are bigger than any man or woman can offer. He longs for something more.

Id: [0x002C8814]
This is not something we can afford to ignore. If we do not have the means to deal with the Red Hand, we should let Eivor.

Id: [0x002C8817]
My choice is made, Father. Do not hope otherwise.

Id: [0x002C8819]
And I shall give it. You are a great warrior, conqueror of this land, and that of your birth.

Id: [0x002C881B]
But, at the end of all things, you will find yourself with nothing but your regrets.

Id: [0x002C8879]
Jora as in "Horse"?

Id: [0x002C887B]
Nyhofn, a wild place found on no map.

Id: [0x002C887C]
Hilde! Hilde!

Id: [0x002C887E]
Hilde, we can't find Olav.

Id: [0x002C8881]
Jora. Of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002C8882]
Jora. Of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002C8883]
My father never wanted children.

Id: [0x002C8884]
My father never wanted children.

Id: [0x002C8885]
Loki's arse. Not again.

Id: [0x002C8886]
We cannot send supplies to Gorm without his guidance.

Id: [0x002C8888]
That's Olav's job, Horse. Not yours. You stick to this port and keep your head down!

Id: [0x002C88A6]
But I cannot let my brother lie forgotten in unknown soil. I must take him home, bury him with what finery I can muster.

Id: [0x002C88A7]
Aye. Until then.

Id: [0x002C88B8]
Onward everyone! Onward!

Id: [0x002C88BF]
Get that ram to the gate and push! And keep pushing! East Anglia depends on it!

Id: [0x002C88C0]
Get that ram to the gate and push! And keep pushing! East Anglia depends on it!

Id: [0x002C88C2]
That was the last gate. Time to end this.

Id: [0x002C88C3]
That was the last gate. Time to end this.

Id: [0x002C88D3]
The horn! It's been so long since I've heard that sweet sound.

Id: [0x002C88D9]
Stay around awhile and judge for yourself.

Id: [0x002C88DA]
Stay around awhile and judge for yourself.

Id: [0x002C88DD]
Those who boast have something to prove. The great have no need for it.

Id: [0x002C88DE]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan. I have carved a furrow through this teeming land, and the skalds sing loud of my deeds.

Id: [0x002C88DF]
I am Eivor of the Raven Clan. I have carved a furrow through this teeming land, and the skalds sing loud of my deeds.

Id: [0x002C88E1]
Respect where it is due. I like that. Here's hoping you fight as smoothly as you talk.

Id: [0x002C88E3]
O, I will. Have no fear of that.

Id: [0x002C88F3]
No. You are supposed to be a leader. So listen now.

Id: [0x002C88F5]
I am no errant child to be talked down to by my elders!

Id: [0x002C88F6]
I am no errant child to be talked down to by my elders!

Id: [0x002C88FD]
They doff their caps and steal my sense. I cannot leave until I know the true number. I cannot!

Id: [0x002C88FE]
Lords and ladies, lords and ladies, dancing in a dell. Jigging in their shirts and socks to dance me off to Hell.

Id: [0x002C88FF]
It's impossible. Twenty-five, then twenty-six? They come and go and take my wits with them.

Id: [0x002C8900]
You mock old Cuthbert, stone soldiers. Hopping in and out, in and out. Like robins on a woodpile.

Id: [0x002C8904]
I have reservations.

Id: [0x002C8905]

Though Mercia wars often with Wessex, these people are Christians. Perhaps I can talk to them, to avert more bloodshed?

Id: [0x002C8908]
I understand. I promised my aid, and I will keep my word.

Id: [0x002C8909]
Enough wringing of souls. Time to act.

Please, I beg you. How many are there? I must know.

Id: [0x002C8922]
The stones! Every time I count them the answer is different. First twenty, then twenty-one! The fairy-folk make a madman of me.

Id: [0x002C8924]
And? How many lords and ladies come to dance a jig?

Id: [0x002C8928]
See! Never the same, never the same. Please… Count them again, you must, to save my wits!

Id: [0x002C8929]
Ha! They have bewitched you too. Twirl and spin, dance and grin. Pyewacket comes to bite your shin.

Id: [0x002C892A]
Never the same. Never the same. Cobweb cloaks and magpie hats!

Id: [0x002C892E]
Don't close your eyes. Or they'll steal the glinting flint, scrobble it away.

Id: [0x002C8932]
How many what?

After that, we should strike at Fulke's supplies all across Suthsexe.

Id: [0x002C8953]
Yes. If she is allowed to dig in at Portcestre, we will lose our chance to rescue Sigurd.

Id: [0x002C8955]
They produce weapons in Crawleah, food in Gildefort. Briggworth is a stronghold. Many Saxon swords there.

Id: [0x002C8956]
We will wait for our allies before the final attack. Until then, we have work to do.

I cannot tell if that went the way you had hoped.

Send me a sign, O Lord. Illuminate my true path. For you are the shepherd and I am the lamb who follows your lamp.

Id: [0x002C8C7C]
You are the light of the world. So do these rays mean something?

Id: [0x002C8C7D]
Your meaning is unclear, God of Gods. Please, there must be some other purpose for my life!

Id: [0x002C8C7F]
You have not left the church in days. The stench offends even God's nose.

Id: [0x002C8C96]
What troubles you?

Another ray! Is that the sign? [beat]An empty lectern? Do you mock the hollow rattle of my soul, Lord?

Id: [0x002C8CA4]
My path is clear. I must throw off the shackles of brotherhood. I will dedicate my life to glorifying God, through another.

Id: [0x002C8CA8]
Thank you, Lord, I will write a blessed [pronounced bless-sed]manuscript praising Aelfred and his great works.

Id: [0x002C8CAD]
So, I have set him on a path to glorify Aelfred? That pompous Saxon? [beat]I hope his writing reeks as much as he does.

Do what you can. But do it quietly. I do not want the public alarmed.

Id: [0x002C8CB4]
Here they come! Stand fast, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C8CB5]
More Saxons! Hold them back!

Id: [0x002C8CB6]
Again they come! How many more can there be?

Id: [0x002C8CB8]
Well fought, Eivor. My archers and I will return to camp and await your further orders.

Id: [0x002C8CBB]
Our work is done. Fulke will have no help from Briggsworth now. See you back at camp.

One day I'm gonna be as strong as Grandfather! I'll wallop the heads off oxen!

Id: [0x002C8CC1]
He uses his powerful wallop to protect us. O, his legend grows with every day!

Id: [0x002C8CC3]
It's our grandfather. And be careful unless you want a walloping.

Id: [0x002C8CC4]
Many cowards have said the same! He uses only one fist. One wallop. Boom! Like a wolf howling with its knuckles!

Id: [0x002C8CC6]
Ha! Good, destiny is coming to your plate. Grandfather, there's someone looking for a walloping!

Id: [0x002C8CC7]
Hello. Yes, I have overwhelmingly powerful strength, but it is not worth talking about.

Id: [0x002C8CCA]
You best depart unless you desire your face become a fist cave.

Id: [0x002C8CCB]
Little ones, what is this wallop you speak of?

Don't say I didn't warn you. The disappointment you will feel, I also feel.

Don't you get tired of all that yelling?

Sinner! Die at the hands of Faith!

Be brave, Kenrick. Do it for Ethelind.

Id: [0x002C8E0D]
O God! Why did you fashion me from such weak clay?

Id: [0x002C8E0E]
This time I am going to do it. This time!

Id: [0x002C8E10]
O, stranger! Here's a tale. I love Ethelind,  a hunter's daughter. But the hunter's a fearsome fellow. Set me a task, he did.

Id: [0x002C8E12]
There's an arrow, stuck in that tree above, that the hunter once fired there.

Id: [0x002C8E14]
You pace about like a dog afraid of a beating. What troubles you?

Looks like child's play to me. Maybe I can help.

Id: [0x002C8E1A]
You got the arrow! Praise be to you, stranger! Bring it back, won't you?

Id: [0x002C8E1F]
O, thank you, stranger! I'll name our firstborn in your honor, swear I will! Er … what is your name?

Id: [0x002C8E23]
O, I know. She's made no secret of that. But now they're dead, and I'm not, so … tra-la-la!

Id: [0x002C8E26]
I have the arrow, proof of your boundless courage.

Id: [0x002C8E27]

I found a letter from Ethelind. Seems she didn't think much of you. You were far from her first choice.

Enough! Crawleah dances with hearth-tongues. Soon it will be ashes.

Id: [0x002C8E3C]
As I promised. As a keeper of God's word, it would be poor form if I did not keep my own.

Id: [0x002C8E3D]
Then my men and I will ride to meet them. We will harry them every step of the way, to buy you time.

Id: [0x002C8E3E]
Warm words do thaw the chill of battle-fear.

Id: [0x002C8E3F]
We've got the last of them!

Id: [0x002C8E40]
Reinforcements from Wincestre have come.

Id: [0x002C8E41]
His fist is a glorious basher of fools, full of great big scars and old dried blood![laugh]

Id: [0x002C8E43]
Gods, it is about time!

Id: [0x002C8E44]
Stop yawping and start rowing!

Id: [0x002C8E45]
Dag, Bragi … grab your oars. The whale-road leads us home.

Id: [0x002C8E46]
Dag, Bragi … grab your oars. The whale-road leads us home.

Id: [0x002C8E48]
Rather silent, Eivor. Anything to say for the mess you led us to?

Id: [0x002C8E4B]
Bragi, sing a victory song.

Id: [0x002C8E4C]
Bragi, sing a victory song.

Another Saxon town fallen to Guthrum's army.

If Sigurd were here, he would be sitting beside you, wiping the blood from his axe and smiling into the breeze.

Id: [0x002C8E62]
There you go again, putting feeling into words that none here can match.

Id: [0x002C8E63]
Fashioned for stout warrior-folk by the All-Father and his kin. For all this, we must give thanks.

How do you mean?

Id: [0x002C8E69]
Afraid I would not return in time to see Kjotve's end! Afraid I would not see him bleed out like a stuck pig in a drift of snow!

Id: [0x002C8F24]
A warm welcome as always, Randvi.

Id: [0x002C8F25]
A warm welcome as always, Randvi.

Id: [0x002C8F2A]
What? Are you going to take me to Clee Hill Spring? O, thank you, stranger! It is a joyous day![laugh]

Id: [0x002C8F2C]
Sigurd will not save you from his father's wrath, Eivor. You should know that by now.

Id: [0x002C8F2E]
Did your raid not go as planned?

Id: [0x002C8F31]
I can wait…

Id: [0x002C8F32]
I can wait…

Id: [0x002C8F3B]
Seeing my father's axe after seventeen winters … it stirred something in me.

A feeling I have not had since … since the day he was killed. Since the day I got this.

Id: [0x002C8F3F]
I think you have lost your edge, Eivor, just like that axe. Maybe Gunnar can help you with both.

Id: [0x002C8F42]
The monster did this thing. It killed us while laughing. Laughing.

Id: [0x002C8F43]
A foul Jotun … a night-goer from the world's rim … it spoke, named itself Grendel … said it would return.

Id: [0x002C8F45]
I bear ill news. Your warriors have fallen. [beat]Who or what did this awful thing?

Id: [0x002C8F46]
I bear ill news. Your warriors have fallen. [beat]Who or what did this awful thing?

Good. We shall wait for it to come back, you and I.

Good. We shall wait for it to come back, you and I.

Id: [0x002C8F50]
Wake. Play. Wake. Play.

No play? Play. Now play! Play.

Id: [0x002C8F55]
Beast! Today you die!

Id: [0x002C8F56]
Beast! Today you die!

Id: [0x002C8F58]
No kill! Play! I play!

Id: [0x002C8F62]
Mother, help! It hurts me, Mother!

Id: [0x002C8F71]
I fervently hope I'm not too heavy. Huh… You seem to be of sturdy build. On to Clee Hill and Saint Milburga's miraculous spring!

Id: [0x002C8F72]
Who are you, stranger? Someone doing penance? A Samaritan? An angel sent from on high?

Id: [0x002C8F74]
[exerts]Wait. This isn't Clee Hill Spring. Not at all. Do not abandon me, stranger!

Id: [0x002C8F75]
Make haste, O stranger! For I am eager to walk again! Once more know the joy of striding across a grassy knoll on a summer's day!

Id: [0x002C8F78]
It has a blunted blade, but it swings well. Can you sharpen it?

You! You smell like my son. My son's blood! Where is he? Where is my boy?

Id: [0x002C8F80]
You. The woman from the farm. You lied about the Danes.

Id: [0x002C8F81]
You. The woman from the farm. You lied about the Danes.

He kept growing in body, but not in mind. He was my boy. My sweet little Grendel.

Id: [0x002C8F85]
As long as it does, you will always be a welcome guest.

Id: [0x002C8F86]
You know, stranger, you interrupted a beautiful dream. I was sailing through Helheim, drifting on a ship of fire.

Id: [0x002C8F87]
You're weak, Sheep-Herder. Your Norse friend here can't change that. We're better off without a king.

Id: [0x002C8F88]
Look there, a lone Dane. Can't trust that.

Id: [0x002C8F8A]
You dare call yourself drengr (a courageous warrior)! Face me, battle-swine! I'll take your head for a trophy!

Id: [0x002C8F8B]
The Saxon-lover comes to fight!

Id: [0x002C8F8C]
And what of your honor, Eivor? How much are you willing to lose?

Id: [0x002C8F8D]
As with everything, an easy task for the Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002C8F8E]
My longship's in Valhalla! Or don't you remember, Fire-Starter?

Id: [0x002C8F8F]
Are you ready for my address?

Id: [0x002C8F90]
Goodbye, friend.

Id: [0x002C8F91]
Oswald, you gutless argr swine! I'll slay the Wolf-Kissed, then hang you with your own tongue.

Id: [0x002C8F92]
I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours, Dane.

Id: [0x002C8F93]
I have come with the hope of meeting Eivor, the great warrior of this clan … if such an audience is possible.

Id: [0x002C8F94]
Hunwald. Who is this stranger?

Id: [0x002C8F95]
You daft lump of lard. A single Dane will not protect you against the whole of Mercia's army.

Id: [0x002C8F96]
I am hot for a fight, snow-dog! Give me half a chance, and I'll stove your heathen face right in!

Id: [0x002C8F97]
Jesus. Fucking heathen.

Id: [0x002C8F98]
Cheers to this Dane! One who knows the true worth of silver!

Id: [0x002C8F99]
You're a fool to challenge this one!

Id: [0x002C8F9A]
I'll vomit on you, Dane! Won't think twice about it!

Id: [0x002C8F9B]
You're losing ground, you drunken sot!

Id: [0x002C8F9C]
I'll vomit on you, Dane! Won't think twice about it!

Id: [0x002C8F9D]
Jesus! He's brought a bloody Dane!

Id: [0x002C8F9E]
Eivor, my champion. Could you recover it for me? The honor of my house depends on it!

Id: [0x002C8F9F]
Your father feared for his life, Hunwald. In his weakened state, he could not defend himself. Not against a Dane, certainly.

Id: [0x002C8FA0]
See this from my view, Hunwald! You arrive after a strange absence with a hired Viking in tow, demanding to see your father.

Id: [0x002C8FA1]
Aye. And I'm not too comforted by the sight of you wielding weapons like a war chief. We're a hospice, not a barracks.

Id: [0x002C8FA2]
Welcome, stranger. Are you here to pay tribute to our Lord Ealdorman?

Id: [0x002C8FA3]
You'll get yours, bloody heathen.

Id: [0x002C8FA4]
I am fine, my love. I wilted without you, but still I grow. And who is this?

Id: [0x002C8FA5]
Eivor has been my champion as I stake my claim in Lincolnscire. But I'm afraid it hasn't gone as well as I'd hoped.

Id: [0x002C8FA6]
Welcome to my estate, old friend.

Id: [0x002C8FA7]
Our war-smith has arrived. The fyrds are ready to fight.

Id: [0x002C8FA8]
Continue the work of God, my boy. Kill this pagan!

Id: [0x002C8FA9]
Thank you, my sturdy Norse berserker. The meadhalls of my shire will be lonely without you stomping about.

Id: [0x002C8FAA]
I have found better friends in Danes to be honest. Swanburrow is my love, and you are a better friend to me than any here.

Id: [0x002C8FAC]
You're a fearless warrior, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C8FAD]
Well, I owe you a great debt, Eivor. You're a worthy ally.

Id: [0x002C8FAE]
Hm. You must be a real broga to hold your own against those shithogs.

Id: [0x002C8FAF]
Eivor, welcome to the West Market.

Id: [0x002C8FB0]
Take this coin. It will give you entry at the coliseum. Welcome to The Arrow's kinship. With luck, you will gain rank.

Id: [0x002C8FB1]
A real fanatic, you are. Get ready…

Id: [0x002C8FB2]
Here's a new competitor. A Norse from the northern wilds of Mercia.

Id: [0x002C8FB3]
Don't just stand there, you bloody clots! Kill that one there!

Id: [0x002C8FB4]
You know piss-all, you cheat.

Id: [0x002C8FB5]
It's that damned Norse!

Id: [0x002C8FB8]
There you are. The drengr we must thank for our good fortune.

Id: [0x002C8FB9]
Ah! A heroic-looking Dane in our midst.

Id: [0x002C8FBA]
Another Dane.

Id: [0x002C8FBB]
My wounds will heal, if not my pride. Who are you, stranger?

Id: [0x002C8FBC]
No doubt my Estrid would prefer his velvet paws to my calloused hands. So, who are you? A sellsword?

Id: [0x002C8FBD]
But ho! Are you the Norse I sent word to?

Id: [0x002C8FBE]
I am glad you answered my summons. I did not expect such a skilled fighter!

Id: [0x002C8FBF]
An advisor, nothing more, here to help Essexe navigate her brewing storms.

Id: [0x002C8FC0]
A Dane? Now that is fascinating. But we live in interesting times, and I must dance where the Devil pipes his tune.

Id: [0x002C8FC1]
You're certainly a better hunter than you are a diplomat, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C8FC2]
You have done the impossible, Dane. Returned my errant gander to his coop.

Id: [0x002C8FC3]
A Dane in Essexe? Now here's a day riddled with strange portents and happenings.

Id: [0x002C8FC4]
Norse by the music of your speech.

Id: [0x002C8FC5]
You've more wit than your face suggests. I went to meet a lad from a nearby village. Rollo's not the only one who dallies with locals.

Id: [0x002C8FC6]
Lies! And curse you, boy, for letting this outsider sway your heart!

Id: [0x002C8FC7]
O! O! Desist, you foul Dane! Guards! O, woe unto me! Put me down!

Id: [0x002C8FC8]
Unhand me, fiend!

Id: [0x002C8FC9]
Unhand me, you filthy Dane! Birstan, my love! My love!

Id: [0x002C8FCA]
I am sure I saw that Dane swanning round the brothel with Estrid!

Id: [0x002C8FCB]
No, you are just one more Dane! And in that chaos, who remembers anything but the screams of dear Estrid?

Id: [0x002C8FCC]
Do not be coy. It does not suit you.

Id: [0x002C8FCD]
Very well. Come find me in Colcestre, my friend!

Id: [0x002C8FCE]
[laugh]For the feast, sweetling. We owe our mutual friend a great debt. One that I promised to repay over suckling pig and ale.

Id: [0x002C8FCF]
A woman he paid this Dane to abduct in that Lammas shadow play?

Id: [0x002C8FD0]
You, Birstan's hired Dane. Do not think what you did went unseen. Yet tell me one thing. Is Estrid safe? And happy?

Id: [0x002C8FD1]
Bless you then! You've given me the family I never thought to have. You will always have my gratitude and love for that.

Id: [0x002C8FD3]
I remember you! You saved us from Hilda. You are a great warrior.

Id: [0x002C8FD4]
It's you! The Hero of Wincestre! Didn't you used to be taller?

Id: [0x002C8FD5]
A Dane treads the cobbles of God's house. In search of Christ's redemption, I hope.

Id: [0x002C8FD6]
Blessed are those who find wisdom. Return when you have it, heathen.

Id: [0x002C8FD7]
You have no soul, Dane.

Id: [0x002C8FD8]
A Dane in Wincestre? These are strange times.

Id: [0x002C8FD9]
A marvel. History will name you the protector of Wincestre. A pricking irony.

Id: [0x002C8FDA]
You are the enemy of Wincestre.

Id: [0x002C8FDB]
You ugly Dane! May God curse you with boils on your face!

Id: [0x002C8FDC]
Good luck, Dane. Try not to get maimed and all that.

Id: [0x002C8FDD]
No, and you were mean, so I hope that crow pecks your stupid nose off.

Id: [0x002C8FDE]
That's her! Dimwit Dane, Dimwit Dane! Didn't guess The Quill's a she!

Id: [0x002C8FDF]
Keep your wits. The Dane wants my blood.

Id: [0x002C8FE0]
Show yourself, murderer!

Id: [0x002C8FE1]
Come then, you rabid hound.

Id: [0x002C8FE2]
This heathen will kill us all.

Id: [0x002C8FE3]
Well, you could pay your respects and see for yourself. The funeral is today.

Id: [0x002C8FE4]
It must be a sour apple to swallow, knowing that you are the last of Wincestre's enemies.

Id: [0x002C8FE5]
Be thou hale, Ealdorbana! That's life-destroyer in our dialect.

Id: [0x002C8FE6]
You're quite safe with me, Dane. For now.

Id: [0x002C8FE7]
Defiler!

Id: [0x002C8FE8]
A stranger comes to Wemba.

Id: [0x002C8FE9]
You hurt Wemba with your stinging words. Bad, bad, bad.

Id: [0x002C8FEA]
You bastard Dane! You're as bad as them. I only ever wanted to serve God.

Id: [0x002C8FEB]
Where are my guards! Did you murder them? You barbarous Dane, and no better than The Order!

Id: [0x002C8FEC]
One more gift for you, Dane. A deadly truth, if you can find it.

Id: [0x002C8FED]
Curse you, Dane. My brother served God!

Id: [0x002C8FEE]
Shouldn't you rejoice at the death of a king? You are a heathen and a devil!

Id: [0x002C8FEF]
This too, I offer you. Live here among us in peace as a Christian, or die a pagan in a blood soaked field. All you have to lose is life everlasting.

Id: [0x002C8FF0]
He offers you hope, Eivor. A life of purpose above and beyond this one. You'd be a fool to refuse.

Id: [0x002C8FF1]
But by proxy, I'll call you a milksop and boor.

Id: [0x002C8FF2]
The failure Eivor returns. Will you compete again?

Id: [0x002C8FF3]
I shall trounce this poor fool without use of my voice.

Id: [0x002C8FF4]
Ah, a peasant. Come for a sound flyting? Please. Place your paltry bet.

Id: [0x002C8FF5]
Milady! The stumble-tongued Norseperson has returned.

Id: [0x002C8FF6]
Ha! Ha ha ha. Another peasant falls to the sparkling wit of the Lady Ellette.

Id: [0x002C8FF7]
You! Dane! Come closer…

Id: [0x002C8FF8]
Eivor of the Raven Clan. My next meal. Are you prepared to be eviscerated with words?

Id: [0x002C8FF9]
I am Fergal the Faceless, and I am clever and strong!<LF>But you're not! You're ugly, and weak, and you're a big smelly coward!!

Id: [0x002C8FFA]
Yet I see in you a child's blissful ignorance of the world's darkest truths. A fool.

Id: [0x002C8FFB]
Welcome back! You've gotten smaller since I saw you last.

Id: [0x002C8FFC]
Well, for a mere speck of a flyter, you're surprisingly strong.

Id: [0x002C8FFD]
Ah! Many apologies. You are no child, simply a frail and fully-grown fool. Ha ha ha!

Id: [0x002C8FFE]
I know you're a weakling! And you … you need only know my impressive scale and flawless build.

Id: [0x002C8FFF]
What a shame. Thought you'd be up for a good spar.

Id: [0x002C9000]
Come back again, if you ever feel ready.

Id: [0x002C9001]
Ha! Sharp as an eagle's talons. You've earned your winnings today.

Id: [0x002C9002]
Sad little louse. Almost a pity to take your earnings. Might have spent them on lessons!

Id: [0x002C9003]
Like so many birds at winter's end, the Dane returns. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002C9004]
Weak! Pathetically weak.

Id: [0x002C9005]
Well! Look at this whelp! Not a lot of fight in you, is there?

Id: [0x002C9006]
You are a Dane! How can you speak of the value of a life? All are ranked as less-than-the-axe to you!

Id: [0x002C9007]
And join Cernunnos … in a bed of leaves. Tuck me in, stranger. With a song.

Id: [0x002C9008]
In the Kingdom of Frisia, we honor your type, pagan. We strive as you strive to achieve the perfection of the Ancient Ones.

Id: [0x002C900A]
May the winds favor your voyage, Guthorm.

Id: [0x002C900B]
You know nothing of my judgment. You know nothing of my plans and strategies.

Id: [0x002C900F]
Sigurd would agree with me.

Id: [0x002C9010]
Sigurd would agree with me.

Id: [0x002C9011]
Would it not be better to work quietly, through diplomacy, gaining alliances?

Id: [0x002C9014]
O.

Id: [0x002C901B]
Waiting until the day our numbers outweigh our enemies' and our victory is guaranteed?

Id: [0x002C901F]
Very soon you will see the fruits of my efforts. Only then will you understand.

Id: [0x002C9021]
I'm at a loss with you, Eivor. When I took you in as my own, never did I imagine such disrespect from the child of Varin.

Id: [0x002C9024]
I am Norse.

Id: [0x002C9025]
I am Norse.

Id: [0x002C9028]
Your father was a fine man. Just and loyal to me. He died bravely so that we might live.

He died a coward, lord. A fate I will not mirror.

My honor has been stained. Until it's wiped clean, I want nothing else.

Spies in our camp. Three men, sent by Kjotve to kill us as we slept. I returned the favor.

Id: [0x002C903F]
O, you are lucky to be here, warrior! You'll see a sight rarely seen by any mortals!

Id: [0x002C9052]
This raid will harden our legacy, Brother. Clans will come crawling, begging us to join them. Our names will echo in the halls of Valhalla.

Id: [0x002C9053]
Go on, Brother. Like we talked about. Blow these doors in like a punishing storm!

Id: [0x002C9057]
You have it all wrong.

Id: [0x002C905D]
Hello. Need something forged?

Id: [0x002C9064]
Then I'd say you have fine taste. Have a look at what I've got.

Id: [0x002C906C]
You must be Gunnar's replacement while he's away.

Id: [0x002C906D]
You must be Gunnar's replacement while he's away.

Good day. Is Gunnar about or … did he leave and not mention it?

Id: [0x002C906F]
Good day. Is Gunnar about or … did he leave and not mention it?

Id: [0x002C9075]
No need for a healer, love. Just to get to the top of that hill. I can do the rest.

Id: [0x002C9077]
Your baby is coming. Where is the nearest healer? I will take you.

Id: [0x002C9078]
Your baby is coming. Where is the nearest healer? I will take you.

Id: [0x002C907D]
You laid down with a god?

Id: [0x002C907E]
You laid down with a god?

Id: [0x002C9081]
I wasn't impregnated by a god, just an ordinary man as bored as me! Doubt he'll want anything to do with this child.

Id: [0x002C9087]
We've made it to the shrine. Do you think the otherworldly father will be able to find us?

Id: [0x002C9088]
We've made it to the shrine. Do you think the otherworldly father will be able to find us?

Id: [0x002C9089]
I see. Then we shall focus on the child instead. Breathe deeply and try to relax. This will take time. I will build a tent.

Id: [0x002C908D]
Who are you, gestr (stranger). Name yourself.

Id: [0x002C908E]
You are Sigurd of the Raven Clan, is that right? Son of the wise King Styrbjorn?

Id: [0x002C908F]
I am. And you are standing on his land, King Harald. Land we have reclaimed with blood and steel.

Id: [0x002C9097]
This is good news, Eivor. The wandering king will tip our fortunes.

Id: [0x002C90A0]
Ha! Glowecestre's ealdorman, Cynon. He helped raise Brig since she was a pup.

Id: [0x002C90AC]
When your victory is in hand, Sigurd, find me at Alrekstad and we will celebrate together.

Id: [0x002C90AF]
Our men will gather at Florli, near the mouth of the fjord northeast of here. Will you join us?

Id: [0x002C90B1]
Hold a moment.

Id: [0x002C90B4]
Harald is generous with his troops. More than I would be.

Id: [0x002C90B8]
Please, Reda! Tell us another!

Id: [0x002C90B9]
Yes, yes, one more. And only because you all have such good taste.

Id: [0x002C90C9]
A curious response, for the meek shall inherit the earth.

Id: [0x002C90CF]
I live a life of violence, but I accept my place in the world.

Id: [0x002C90D0]
I live a life of violence, but I accept my place in the world.

Id: [0x002C90D3]
Aelfred bleeds his land dry, works you all to the bone for a needless war. Now he wants you to die for it.

Id: [0x002C90D4]
You are good men and true. I would not want this day to be your last.

Id: [0x002C90D7]
The forges have been destroyed. No more weapons will be made here.

Id: [0x002C90D8]
The forges have been destroyed. No more weapons will be made here.

Id: [0x002C90DA]
Me? Fanciful? All of my stories are perfectly and mostly true.

Id: [0x002C90DB]
A stirring story. Fanciful, but sincere enough.

Id: [0x002C90DC]
A stirring story. Fanciful, but sincere enough.

Id: [0x002C90DD]
Now, this one … this one begins a long time ago at a desert oasis, far away. A place of mystery, wonder, and a temple to a hidden god.

Id: [0x002C90F1]
Yes, I remember. Well, I have brought the best archers in Lincolnscire to lend their bows to your cause.

Id: [0x002C90F2]
My lord has sent you the best archers in Lincolnscire, and I am here to lead them!

Id: [0x002C90F7]
That is the very definition of a prince.

Id: [0x002C90F9]
Yes, I know.

Id: [0x002C90FA]
Yes, I know.

Id: [0x002C90FB]
Name it.

Id: [0x002C90FC]
Is … is this what you want?

Id: [0x002C90FD]
Kjotve robbed my father of all honor and dignity. I will win it back.

Id: [0x002C90FE]
Kjotve robbed my father of all honor and dignity. I will win it back.

Id: [0x002C9103]
How do you feel?

Id: [0x002C9106]
Did you ever desire something so fiercely that it haunted your every day and night?

Id: [0x002C9107]
Did you ever desire something so fiercely that it haunted your every day and night?

Odin favored the ugly brother then?

Id: [0x002C9109]
Odin favored the ugly brother then?

Id: [0x002C910B]
Wallow in shit, Wolf-Kissed! Archers, take aim!

Id: [0x002C910C]
Your father is dead, Gorm! His debt repaid! Open the gates and you will be spared!

Id: [0x002C910D]
Your father is dead, Gorm! His debt repaid! Open the gates and you will be spared!

Id: [0x002C910F]
I have done so already, Sigurd. He'll be more than pleased, and will ensure you pride of place at his Althing (clan gathering) at Alrekstad.

Id: [0x002C9110]
Tell him we will come! Battle flushed and singing songs of glory.

Id: [0x002C9113]
Linger here and loot what you can. I will bring news of our victory to Father before he leaves for Harald's Althing.

Id: [0x002C911A]
You are not short on confidence. That much is clear.

Id: [0x002C911D]
I found something of interest on one of the scouts.

A leader should not second-guess themselves. Nobody respects a tremble-heart.

Id: [0x002C9125]
If your method is to risk hundreds for the sake of one, then you are right. I don't.

Id: [0x002C9126]
I have a method, Guthrum. And though you may not see it, it has served me well.

Id: [0x002C9127]
I have a method, Guthrum. And though you may not see it, it has served me well.

Id: [0x002C9128]
I have known plenty as brash as you. Not many are left in this world.

Id: [0x002C9129]
I hear stories of a man full of tempests, picking fights in taverns. We must hope, when hope is all we have.

Id: [0x002C912A]
You there, untie us! Let us walk and we will not hurt you!

Id: [0x002C912E]
Fine work. A long house to rival any I have seen.

Id: [0x002C9130]
Now come. Randvi has found something I would like you to see.

Id: [0x002C9132]
They number too many.

Id: [0x002C9133]
They number too many.

Id: [0x002C9135]
I will speak with Randvi about this.

Id: [0x002C9136]
I will speak with Randvi about this.

Id: [0x002C9140]
He will heal, but never fully recover. It is fortunate that you were able to succeed where he failed.

Id: [0x002C9142]
Is Hytham well?

Id: [0x002C9143]
Is Hytham well?

Id: [0x002C9144]
My resolve was strong.

Id: [0x002C9145]
My resolve was strong.

Id: [0x002C9148]
They are all of one in my memory. A single great battle that stretches from my first breath to the end of this sentence.

Id: [0x002C914A]
Where did Torsten die? On a field or in a marsh? We were close as brothers once, yet I don't recall where or when.

Id: [0x002C914B]
Guthrum Jarl. Your second, Soma, talked often of you and your conquests.

Id: [0x002C914C]
Guthrum Jarl. Your second, Soma, talked often of you and your conquests.

Id: [0x002C914F]
The needle of loss becomes blunt once you have been pierced enough. But enough of that.

Id: [0x002C9150]
You wear the scars of battle, and not only on your skin.

Id: [0x002C9151]
You wear the scars of battle, and not only on your skin.

Id: [0x002C9154]
I am merciless in battle, yes. And melancholy in my bed. A balance of humors, I suppose.

Id: [0x002C9155]
You speak with great feeling. In the tales, you are merciless in battle.

Id: [0x002C9156]
You speak with great feeling. In the tales, you are merciless in battle.

Id: [0x002C9159]
Why did you come to my banner if you mistrust my judgement?

Id: [0x002C915A]
Why did you come to my banner if you mistrust my judgement?

Id: [0x002C915B]
I want Portcestre. You want what is held within her. And I will not become king by passing up chances like this.

Id: [0x002C915D]
Ah, faith. The most mysterious of words. They use it a lot here in Wessex. I'm not even sure what it means.

Id: [0x002C915E]
Have faith, then. Together we will triumph.

Id: [0x002C915F]
Have faith, then. Together we will triumph.

Id: [0x002C9161]
When you slew Kjotve, did you see a sigil on him? Silver, the size of my palm, bearing the symbol of an ash-tree.

Id: [0x002C9167]
We are seekers of justice, shepherds of man's will. We work in the dark to serve the light.

Id: [0x002C916A]
Not at all. So long as men and women fight to secure honor and freedom, their allegiance hardly matters to me.

Id: [0x002C916B]
A gift of knowledge from a man I hardly know. Is this your way of asking me to join your brotherhood?

Id: [0x002C916C]
A gift of knowledge from a man I hardly know. Is this your way of asking me to join your brotherhood?

Id: [0x002C916F]
Then let's see what can be done to cleanse that stain. Give it a try.

Id: [0x002C9170]
I suppose there is no shame in using deception when honor is at stake. And Gorm is a stain on that honor.

Id: [0x002C9171]
I suppose there is no shame in using deception when honor is at stake. And Gorm is a stain on that honor.

Id: [0x002C9172]
No more words, poison-tongue!

Id: [0x002C9173]
No more words, poison-tongue!

Id: [0x002C9174]
Remain far from watchful eyes and you will be invisible to them.

Id: [0x002C917A]
Our words were overshadowed by Sigurd's performance. Not that I blame him. He expected a crown and will inherit a badge.

Id: [0x002C917B]
Uh … gods, I hate long speeches.

Id: [0x002C917F]
You remember my mother, Eivor? Trygve told me a story about her when father was ill. I had never heard him talk about her before.

Id: [0x002C9183]
Do you dream of a glorious future, Eivor? A warrior like you would be a boon to my clan.

Id: [0x002C9186]
I hardly remember her myself. There are pictures here and there that float in my dream-dome, but not even her voice lingers.

Id: [0x002C918B]
When I was a babe, my father dropped me once, and my mother hit him so hard, he could not hear for a month.

Id: [0x002C9196]
I think I miss her, but how can you miss something you don't remember? [beat]I worry that you cannot, that I have invented this grief.

Id: [0x002C91A6]
Olav, I am. Olav. Called the Unlucky, but don't you believe it.

Id: [0x002C91A8]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002C91A9]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002C91AA]
And where is--

Id: [0x002C91AB]
And where is--

Id: [0x002C91AD]
How about the tale of the return of a jarl? Father was not always this cheerful. Not when he held his spear.

Id: [0x002C91B2]
Stop washing your face with mead.

Id: [0x002C91B3]
Stop washing your face with mead.

Id: [0x002C91BB]
I am thinking on the battle to come. Every conflict has a cost. I wonder who will pay this time?

Id: [0x002C91BD]
The ache of absent souls is a wound that never heals. But we may yet return your brother to your side. There is that.

Id: [0x002C91BF]
Soma Jarlskona. You seem grave.

Id: [0x002C91C0]
Soma Jarlskona. You seem grave.

Id: [0x002C91C1]
We are no strangers to loss, you and I.

Id: [0x002C91C2]
We are no strangers to loss, you and I.

Id: [0x002C91C3]
Fulke and her men will bear the cost today, not us.

Id: [0x002C91C4]
Fulke and her men will bear the cost today, not us.

Id: [0x002C91C5]
I wish I were as sure of it as you.

Id: [0x002C91C7]
Bjorn, here as promised.

Id: [0x002C91C8]
Bjorn, here as promised.

Id: [0x002C91FC]
Advice? You need none of that now. You stand in no one's shadow, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C91FE]
It may be that one day our paths lead us to doom, Eivor. But at least we can say the footprints we left were our own.

Id: [0x002C91FF]
Ubba. Any advice before we begin?

Id: [0x002C9200]
Ubba. Any advice before we begin?

Id: [0x002C9201]
Lofty praise from the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002C9202]
Lofty praise from the son of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002C9205]
It may surprise you, but I was no stranger to horse and hunt in my younger days.

Id: [0x002C9207]
It is Fulke I fight. A false Christian, preaching a corruption of God's word. If I can assist in her downfall, I will.

Id: [0x002C9209]
Bishop Deorlaf. Strange to see a man of God on the battle lines.

Id: [0x002C920A]
Bishop Deorlaf. Strange to see a man of God on the battle lines.

Id: [0x002C920B]
It is Saxons we fight this day, Deorlaf. Not Britons, and not in Mercia.

Id: [0x002C920C]
It is Saxons we fight this day, Deorlaf. Not Britons, and not in Mercia.

Id: [0x002C920D]
Then you are welcome here, friend.

Id: [0x002C920E]
Then you are welcome here, friend.

Id: [0x002C9214]
In spite of our losses, we claimed victory here. Arguing over blame will not bring the dead back.

Id: [0x002C9215]
In spite of our losses, we claimed victory here. Arguing over blame will not bring the dead back.

Id: [0x002C9218]
Indeed. The fault is none but mine for putting my trust in you.

Id: [0x002C9219]
You knew the danger as well as I did, Guthrum. You saw opportunity, and you took it.

Id: [0x002C921A]
You knew the danger as well as I did, Guthrum. You saw opportunity, and you took it.

Id: [0x002C921D]
Many have died, my friend here among them. The fault is mine. Knowing that is shame enough.

Id: [0x002C921E]
Many have died, my friend here among them. The fault is mine. Knowing that is shame enough.

Id: [0x002C921F]
Small comfort that is to the dead.

Id: [0x002C9224]
What happened here? And what befell the driver?

Id: [0x002C9225]
What happened here? And what befell the driver?

Id: [0x002C9236]
Guthrum was hasty in his judgment, Eivor. You are fit to stand with the best of us.

Id: [0x002C9237]
Hello? I can hear you out there! Aren't you going to save me?

Id: [0x002C923A]
Go to your brother. The words of one beloved will heal him faster than herbs. I will see to matters here.

Id: [0x002C923E]
May the gods guide you, Ubba. Until we meet again.

Id: [0x002C923F]
May the gods guide you, Ubba. Until we meet again.

Id: [0x002C9242]
We have beaten them back for now, but without Guthrum's army, we do not have the numbers to hold this fort.

Id: [0x002C9243]
Is that the last of them?

Id: [0x002C9244]
Is that the last of them?

Id: [0x002C9245]
Did you kill it? You weren't supposed to actually kill it! Get in here, now! I want a word with you!

Id: [0x002C9247]
The fabric of this world has been used up, torn, shredded, you see. Someone must be there to stitch it back together.

Id: [0x002C9249]
Gratitude? That was my prize fighting bear you killed. How am I supposed to make my living now?

Id: [0x002C924A]
Your gratitude is touching.

Id: [0x002C924B]
Your gratitude is touching.

Id: [0x002C924D]
Think your men are going to stop me?

Id: [0x002C924E]
Think your men are going to stop me?

Id: [0x002C925C]
So many battles and so few scars, Basim! What's your secret?

Id: [0x002C925D]
I don't get hit!

Id: [0x002C925E]
Aha! The simplest strategies are the best!

Id: [0x002C925F]
I would not undermine them so. The Red Hand are loyal to our cause. Which is more than I can say for the merchants.

Id: [0x002C9260]
Make it quick. Meet me in the marketplace when you are done.

Id: [0x002C9263]
Fine, Otta. I will show these children what a true legend is.

Id: [0x002C9264]
Fine, Otta. I will show these children what a true legend is.

Id: [0x002C9265]
What waits for you on the other side of death, Basim?

Id: [0x002C9266]
I thought I knew once. Now I think otherwise.

Id: [0x002C9267]
A bad day to be uncertain.

Id: [0x002C9271]
Soma! You fight like Vidarr, hungry for revenge!

Id: [0x002C9272]
I would say the same of you, Ubba Ragnarsson!

Id: [0x002C928B]
Still fresh.

Id: [0x002C928C]
Is this Sigurd's blood?

Id: [0x002C928D]
Is this Sigurd's blood?

Id: [0x002C9290]
Sigurd. Every instant of your torment, Fulke will suffer tenfold.

Id: [0x002C9291]
Sigurd. Every instant of your torment, Fulke will suffer tenfold.

Id: [0x002C9296]
What will the skalds say when they speak of this day?

Id: [0x002C9297]
What will the skalds say when they speak of this day?

Id: [0x002C929A]
They will say we unleashed such rampant slaughter that Odin himself stirred on his throne to watch!

Id: [0x002C929B]
They will say we unleashed such rampant slaughter that Odin himself stirred on his throne to watch!

Id: [0x002C929D]
So raise your swords with me now, brothers and sisters. For today is the day we carve our names into legend!

Id: [0x002C929E]
So raise your swords with me now, brothers and sisters. For today is the day we carve our names into legend!

Id: [0x002C92A3]
I'm coming for you, Brother.

Id: [0x002C92A4]
I'm coming for you, Brother.

Id: [0x002C92A8]
You're leaving? Darn, I was starting to like the twang of your bow. Good twang. Come back anytime.

Id: [0x002C92AC]
So you served The Vault, knowing full well what he was a part of.

Id: [0x002C92AD]
So you served The Vault, knowing full well what he was a part of.

Id: [0x002C92AE]
But God did not save me. The Vault did. He took me to a fine house. Gave me hearty meals. A warm bed.

Id: [0x002C92B1]
I am sorry for your troubles but glad for your help.

Id: [0x002C92B2]
I am sorry for your troubles but glad for your help.

Id: [0x002C92BB]
Mummy's ring! I just took it out to look at it and a mean bird snatched them off me!

Id: [0x002C92BE]
What happened, little one?

Id: [0x002C92BF]
What happened, little one?

Id: [0x002C92C2]
He had no such authority, why would anyone believe him?

Id: [0x002C92C5]
There is the bird's nest.

Id: [0x002C92C6]
There is the bird's nest.

Id: [0x002C92E1]
I saw you talking to my stepmother down there! Did she try to take it off you? What a warty old dragon!

Id: [0x002C92E2]
I have your mother's ring. Be careful in the future. We should hold tight to what is precious.

Id: [0x002C92E3]
I have your mother's ring. Be careful in future. We should hold tight to what is precious.

Id: [0x002C92E5]
Bring it back! Please bring it back! Bad birdie!

Id: [0x002C92E6]
Wait! This is it. It must be.

Id: [0x002C92E7]
Psalm 119? Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.

Id: [0x002C92E8]
My words? Does He mean… that I should become … a writer?

Id: [0x002C92E9]
And then? Of course … the unfolding of your words gives light and understanding to the simple.

Id: [0x002C92EA]
The texts are safest with me. I will do what I must to guard them from the Red Hand.

Id: [0x002C92F4]
Says the child of a jarl then a king then a jarl.

Id: [0x002C92F5]
We are going west, in fact. Basim is a tireless crusader.

Id: [0x002C92F6]
Of course. Thank you.

Id: [0x002C92FA]
I'm not about to get up and run off like this, Love!

Id: [0x002C92FB]
Stay there. I'll handle this.

Id: [0x002C92FC]
Stay there. I'll handle this.

Id: [0x002C92FD]
But it need not be like this. We are not the heel-trodden subjects of a boy-king! We are the Raven Clan. Our destiny is our own!

Id: [0x002C9306]
More than enough, wife. Of the four kingdoms of England, only one is truly pacified.

Id: [0x002C930B]
You seem to want your nose broken, so let me oblige.

Id: [0x002C930C]
You seem to want your nose broken, so let me oblige.

Id: [0x002C9320]
Hoo, Mother was right. Always keep the legs closed.

Id: [0x002C9321]
[Ono: pained panting]Fucking shit.

Id: [0x002C9322]
Ugh! The baby is coming!

Id: [0x002C9325]
Your silence earns you no kindness, Geat. So I'll ask once more. Who sent you?

Id: [0x002C9326]
Your silence earns you no kindness, Geat. So I will ask once more. Who sent you?

Id: [0x002C9327]
Sigurd is not here to make such a call. But I am. And if you cross me again, he will know about it.

Id: [0x002C9328]
Sigurd is not here to make such a call. But I am. And if you cross me again, he will know about it.

Id: [0x002C9330]
I shall pray for you. Now, if you'll forgive me.

Id: [0x002C9331]
I cannot say that I am at peace. My life is a violent one.

Id: [0x002C9332]
I cannot say that I am at peace. My life is a violent one.

Id: [0x002C9333]
Yours is an arduous path.

Id: [0x002C9334]
You could have come to me in confidence, Dag. But that offer is gone.

Id: [0x002C9335]
You could have come to me in confidence, Dag. But that offer is gone.

Id: [0x002C9338]
What?

Id: [0x002C9339]
What?

Id: [0x002C933A]
She claimed to know him, to admire him. Said he was a greater man than we could ever know.

Id: [0x002C933B]
She claimed to know him, to admire him. Said he was a greater man than we could ever know.

Id: [0x002C933E]
And you used your chance to destroy a way of life you did not support.

Id: [0x002C933F]
And you used your chance to destroy a way of life you did not support.

Id: [0x002C9343]
Eivor is the victor. But you've shown us something, Oswald.

Id: [0x002C9347]
A Dane? Leading a Saxon army?

Id: [0x002C9349]
Wolf-Kissed! Gaze upon my pots. They stand so strong! Unbreakable at this distance, no?

Id: [0x002C934A]
Good. Come, come. Join me.

Id: [0x002C934B]
Eivor! Come! Sit!

Id: [0x002C934C]
Of course, my friend. I am a man of action above all else. Ready to leap and dance and fight!

Id: [0x002C934D]
Eivor! My bladder is bursting! I must step outside for a long deserved slash! Keep them dancing 'til I return!

Id: [0x002C934E]
A worthy tussle, Dane! Give this one a cup of mead! They are not the dogs we take them for.

Id: [0x002C9350]
Please, don't hurt me. These poor souls need me.

Id: [0x002C9351]
I pray you find him. He's in desperate need of care.

Id: [0x002C9352]
I can tell you a few things. But not here in the open. Follow me.

Id: [0x002C9353]
Leave us be. It is not your place to be asking such questions.

Id: [0x002C9354]
Go then. Why linger here?

Id: [0x002C9355]
Come! Sit, sit. Stay with me a while and concemplate … conmemtate … contemplate the view.

Id: [0x002C9356]
Plain and clear! Follow me!

Id: [0x002C9357]
Eivor agreed to help me find my father. But I'm afraid it hasn't gone as well as I'd hoped.

Id: [0x002C9358]
Now, now, take it and come hither. I have a rousing hunt planned for the two of us.

Id: [0x002C9359]
A hearty hello, drengr (courageous warrior). Seems Britain is getting quite used to the idea of Danes stalking her shores.

Id: [0x002C935A]
Good, good. But let me say unreservedly that I am the man who will lead Lincolnscire into progress and victory.

Id: [0x002C935B]
Chieftain Eivor. Can we win this fight with the men you see assembled here?

Id: [0x002C935C]
Chieftain Eivor. Can we win this battle with the small number you see assembled here?

Id: [0x002C935D]
Chieftain Eivor! We are ever so glad you came.

Id: [0x002C935E]
That's the one. Do you know what he means?

Id: [0x002C935F]
Find us for a drink sometime, eh, Broga?

Id: [0x002C9360]
Come sup with us later, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C9362]
You shall. We want to show you the result of all your aid.

Id: [0x002C9363]
Will you rule over these cinders now? Yoke its people to your whims and needs?

Id: [0x002C9364]
You do have power here. Power you have earned.

Id: [0x002C9365]
No, we've a quiet day, once in a great while! Try not to kill anyone, eh?

Id: [0x002C9366]
God'n Heaven, you fight like the Devil's stolen your bread.

Id: [0x002C9367]
You don't finish fights as well as you start them.

Id: [0x002C9368]
There's no cause to be leery. Eivor had my back in a brawl at Cripple Gate. More thugs from the garrison.

Id: [0x002C9369]
Look at us sitting on our laurels, while Eivor does all the work.

Id: [0x002C936A]
Begone, you reek of someplace else.

Id: [0x002C936B]
Stowe? Stomp this one into the dirt!

Id: [0x002C936C]
Heh, ja. You know exactly what we're about.

Id: [0x002C936D]
Want a trial round to test your eye?

Id: [0x002C936E]
You're a poor shot, that's the end of it.

Id: [0x002C936F]
There may be a way. Let's regroup in the church when you've had time to rest, Broga.

Id: [0x002C9370]
Then I'll be at Saint Paul's Church, waiting for the good word. Take care, Broga.

Id: [0x002C9371]
Thanks for all this, Broga.

Id: [0x002C9372]
Do take your time though, we may throw a picnic!

Id: [0x002C9374]
Aye, Broga. And you deserve this.

Id: [0x002C9375]
Do you yet see an ember of my Frankish fire, Raven-walker? Perhaps it dances in my eyes?

Id: [0x002C9376]
Well fought, friend. I would not have survived this ambush without you.

Id: [0x002C9377]
Are you the Good Samaritan who saved my worthless skin?

Id: [0x002C9378]
Do not fret. My guards will not worry you when we are together.

Id: [0x002C9379]
No, he disapproves. Is that not infinitely worse? But look, we are nearing my hall.

Id: [0x002C937A]
Who is this owl, Birstan, that twitters in your ear?

Id: [0x002C937B]
Ha! She does as she must. As do I. But you will discover this soon enough.

Id: [0x002C937C]
Good luck in your endeavors, Eivor. I pray you find my Alfida, with a fair face and a yearning heart.

Id: [0x002C937D]
Leave me be, warmonger! You have my sister, is that not enough?

Id: [0x002C937E]
They still shine brightly, as when we were children. Has Eivor told you all?

Id: [0x002C937F]
Aye, she has.

Id: [0x002C9380]
Please, do not stray far.

Id: [0x002C9381]
Very well. But do not let Loki whisper lies in your ear.

Id: [0x002C9382]
You know nothing, Raven-beak. My concern is for my fellow Danes. You'll find no treachery here.

Id: [0x002C9383]
You want to hear my story? Then bring me a mug of ale, and we'll sit and talk as equals. Elsewise you can hang.

Id: [0x002C9384]
Never doubt me, Raven-Feeder. These Saxon king-slaves did.

Id: [0x002C9385]
O! Tell me!

Id: [0x002C9386]
My axe is yours. Speak.

Id: [0x002C9387]
Say no more, my friend. I'll vouch for you. It's the least I can do for the price of my life. Perhaps we can drink a cup or two!

Id: [0x002C9388]
You'll get nothing from me. I'm as loyal as the king's hounds.

Id: [0x002C9389]
Show yourself, shadow-walker.

Id: [0x002C938A]
Who are you to judge a man of faith? You, a Dane who believes in giants and wolves that eat the sun? Begone!

Id: [0x002C938B]
God's blood! What are you doing?

Id: [0x002C938C]
Let Ealhferth rest in peace.

Id: [0x002C938D]
Leave me to my grief.

Id: [0x002C938E]
Get away from me, demon.

Id: [0x002C938F]
Why won't you leave me alone!

Id: [0x002C9390]
Why are you doing this?

Id: [0x002C9391]
You were wrong, Goodwin. This one is beyond saving.

Id: [0x002C9392]
O you think you're so clever, I'm almost impressed,<LF>That you managed to blurt something out.

Id: [0x002C9393]
But instead I'll persist 'til you beg me to stop…

Id: [0x002C9394]
Ugh. Pay what is due and send this peasant away. I grow weary.

Id: [0x002C9395]
I've heard all the rumors that Eivor the Dane is a coward, a cur, and a leech.

Id: [0x002C9396]
Eivor, back again! I've heard you're scared of flyting. Is that true?

Id: [0x002C9397]
Come to repair your reputation, have you?

Id: [0x002C9398]
Eivor the Quitter! I'll pass it on.

Id: [0x002C9399]
Eivor! Of the Raven Clan? Come here, come closer.

Id: [0x002C939A]
Do you like to drink?

Id: [0x002C939B]
If you're sober, then leave! For there's naught here for you!

Id: [0x002C939C]
Eivor! Eivor's returned! Have a drink with us, and we'll flyt again!

Id: [0x002C939D]
Ha! I like this one! Are you ready? What about one more drink before we begin? For luck.

Id: [0x002C939E]
Ah! Look at you, big an' tall. What's your name?

Id: [0x002C939F]
Ah! You think you can win with rhyme, do you? Well … if you like to rhyme, listen this time.

Id: [0x002C93A0]
You are savage, uncouth, and care little for life.<LF>Like the rest of your kind, you breed mis'ry and strife.

Id: [0x002C93A1]
Go now! Return when you've grown up!

Id: [0x002C93A2]
Shame. Come back when you're ready for a challenge.

Id: [0x002C93A3]
You're a misfit, a half-wit, a foolish old grouse!

Id: [0x002C93A4]
You've returned. Now I hope you don't forget.

Id: [0x002C93A5]
No no no. Wound me! Don't go easy on me! I can take it!

Id: [0x002C93A6]
You call yourself a flyter? Ugh.

Id: [0x002C93A7]
Ha! Look at you, face like a stuffed beaver.

Id: [0x002C93A8]
With pleasure. Place your bet, won't you?

Id: [0x002C93A9]
You're brilliant. Are you certain I can't convince you to tarry a moment? We could go somewhere and--

Id: [0x002C93AA]
What of it? I forged good from what you call evil. Lives were improved, lives worth more than the silver that paid for them.

Id: [0x002C93AB]
These Hidden Ones, is that who you slave for?

Id: [0x002C93AC]
Ah, listen! Do you hear? The excuses of a mind enslaved.[laugh]

Id: [0x002C93AD]
No, no, no … I place power on power. The great becomes greater. You will see.

Id: [0x002C93AE]
About the challenge I'd expect from a friend of Oswald.

Id: [0x002C93AF]
Oswald, my boy. You're useless without your raven.

Id: [0x002C93B0]
Wait. You're unarmed.

Id: [0x002C93B4]
Better than her brothers too. She charged into battle without fear.

Id: [0x002C93B5]
He stormed Burgh Castle, brought Rued to his knees. And let Oswald hold him for trial?

Id: [0x002C93B7]
Mead and pots confound the Wolf-Kissed! When they write your saga, I'll remind them of this embarrassment.

Id: [0x002C93B8]
Eivor, Eivor. Some sweet wine for a sweet swine. Come join me!

Id: [0x002C93B9]
And to Eivor, without whom none of this would have been possible!

Id: [0x002C93BA]
Better than most, my friend. I wish you good fortune in the times ahead.

Id: [0x002C93BB]
Ah! You are the chieftain here! I suspected as much.

Id: [0x002C93BC]
Surprised to find a Dane by his side?

Id: [0x002C93BD]
Eivor, Broga of Clan Raven, Lunden shall ever house you in her welcoming bosom.

Id: [0x002C93BE]
The Arrow awaits his new champion at the Imperial Arch. Don't delay.

Id: [0x002C93BF]
I am deep in your debt, stranger.

Id: [0x002C93C1]
I'm feeling better, friend. Just need a moment to gather my strength.

Id: [0x002C93C2]
Ha! We'll fight to the death, worthy one.

Id: [0x002C93C3]
You have my gratitude. To stumble upon me in my moment of greatest peril, perhaps you were God-sent?

Id: [0x002C93C4]
Ready to help me fend off the spears of their displeasure?

Id: [0x002C93C5]
Now speak plain. Why have you come for me?

Id: [0x002C93C6]
We are safe enough to walk I think. Aren't we?

Id: [0x002C93C7]
My goodness. You're a philosopher too. I wish I had met you earlier. Years ago.

Id: [0x002C93C8]
Why does your honesty make you more alluring still? Le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point.

Id: [0x002C93C9]
Beautifully said, my friend! Beautifully said.

Id: [0x002C93CA]
I have invited you here to speak on equal terms. Do the Dane laws of hospitality not apply in Wessex?

Id: [0x002C93CB]
Alright, alright. No harm meant. Stay out of trouble you grubmite.

Id: [0x002C93CC]
This one's brave and strong. Might be able to help us.

Id: [0x002C93CD]
Go on, give him what you took. Maybe he can save us?

Id: [0x002C93CE]
Keep your beak out, nosey. I'm starving!

Id: [0x002C93CF]
Come you closer, friend Eivor, and lend me your ear.

Id: [0x002C93D0]
I have heard much about you and none of it good,<LF>You've the softness and brains of a sheep.

Id: [0x002C93D1]
They say you're a coward, who runs from a fight.

Id: [0x002C93D2]
You're a pig-headed, ugly, excuse for a Dane.

Id: [0x002C93D3]
You look to be a good fighter … but do you dare to face the greatest battle you will ever know?

Id: [0x002C93D4]
Terrible work. You are likely better at killing than flyting. I will keep your money.

Id: [0x002C93D5]
You miniscule little imp! You're a terrible flyter!

Id: [0x002C93D6]
I'm impressed. You are sharp as that axe on your belt.

Id: [0x002C93D7]
Ha! Another weakling crushed underfoot. Come back when you've gained some strength.

Id: [0x002C93D8]
Weakness. Utter weakness.

Id: [0x002C93D9]
You've returned. What a pleasure to see you again.

Id: [0x002C93DA]
Ah! Good morning. Up bright and early.

Id: [0x002C93DB]
Treacherous she-wolf! Damn you!

Id: [0x002C93DC]
Three cheers for Eivor, the most masterful wordsmith in all of England!

Id: [0x002C93DD]
Yes, we did! How good of you to come. The food's not fully prepared, however. Return after night falls and we'll have a rousing good feast, hm?

Id: [0x002C93E1]
You'd throw in with these wastrels, these argr (cowardly) swine? For what, a scrap of land and a promise of peace?

Id: [0x002C93E2]
There is, there is! You won't be disappointed by what Elmenham has to offer.

Id: [0x002C93E3]
You turned out to be an excellent tool of the Lord's will. You don't understand what an honor that is, but perhaps in time you will.

Id: [0x002C93E4]
Aelfgar cares as much for his people as a goat cares for politics. Rest easy, knowing you have broken no wheel.

Id: [0x002C93E5]
Rip a lung out!

Id: [0x002C93E7]
Of course. You're welcome to search through his effects, though I'm not sure what trinket would best serve your purpose.

Id: [0x002C93E8]
I deeply regret my churlish ways when we first met. I did not treat you as my God commands … with kindness and love.

Id: [0x002C93E9]
My father would have liked you. He liked all those who could swing a sword and speak a verse with ease.

Id: [0x002C93EA]
I suppose so. But I thought you a more fitting recipient. You'd know how to use it.

Id: [0x002C93EB]
Hail, Eivor. Did he lure you here as well, with the promise of a hunt?

Id: [0x002C93EC]
You have earned the trust of our three candidates, it seems. Even our bishop has found a certain fondness for your hardy spirit.

Id: [0x002C93ED]
You can never be certain where you stand in another's heart. Choose only for yourself.

Id: [0x002C93EE]
Eivor, you fought as one possessed by a demon today.

Id: [0x002C93F0]
He would have welcomed you heartily. He was a trusting man. And that got him here.

Id: [0x002C93F2]
O, you've a filthy mind for strategy.

Id: [0x002C93F3]
How unfortunate. A stirring of wind stole your chance.

Id: [0x002C93F4]
You're unharmed. Praise be to God!

Id: [0x002C93F5]
Well, well … this one's got the gift of Odin's mead.

Id: [0x002C93F6]
Are you ready?

Id: [0x002C93F7]
Eivor … we were… we didn't see you enter.

Id: [0x002C93F8]
I can lead you straight to him. Through the reeds, like Stowe's Moses.

Id: [0x002C93F9]
Have you come to a firm conclusion?

Id: [0x002C93FA]
Did you not have even a little fun?

Id: [0x002C93FB]
Eivor, dearheart! You who drew back the bow of Eros and reunited me with my one true love.

Id: [0x002C93FD]
Speak the deeds of Christ in order. Only then will you will cometh unto my Lord.

Id: [0x002C93FE]
Then return when you no longer languish in a pit of ignorance.

Id: [0x002C93FF]
Thou art weighed in the balances … and found wanting.

Id: [0x002C9400]
And you have plunged my city into chaos. I had hoped you would use the lessons of your subtler gods.

Id: [0x002C9401]
You again. You should mind your own beeswax.

Id: [0x002C9402]
No, but you were nice, so I will be nice too. You should talk to Aelwyn and Wigbert. They know everything.

Id: [0x002C9403]
The Quill? God blind me, you're brave! Find Aelwyn and Wigbert. They see everything.

Id: [0x002C9404]
Hides? S'plood, no! This is a wake, my friend. A celebration to ease The Quill on her way to eternal damnation.

Id: [0x002C9405]
If the mead is fresh and the air is cool, you may often find a friend, even amongst your enemies.

Id: [0x002C9406]
You treated me with kindness, but this damned order. Their machinations killed my brother, so the rest may rot.

Id: [0x002C9407]
I'll topple you over with nary a word.

Id: [0x002C9408]
You have bested me squarely, and thus won the day.

Id: [0x002C9409]
Foolish. Yet to be graced by her presence may balance the pain of the loss you will most assuredly suffer.

Id: [0x002C940A]
Silent whispers all claim that you're terribly dense.

Id: [0x002C940B]
They will only respect you for how much you're drinking.

Id: [0x002C940C]
You are braver than most. Or perhaps more foolish. Come, I will give you a key.

Id: [0x002C940D]
I watched you on your approach. How must it feel not to carry the weight of years?

Id: [0x002C940E]
As predicted. A slow brain and a fat tongue.

Id: [0x002C940F]
What tiny little child approaches?

Id: [0x002C9410]
I hope you're ready.

Id: [0x002C9411]
Come back when you improve.

Id: [0x002C9412]
Ah, so you've had a taste, but still want more. Shall we do it?

Id: [0x002C9413]
I could feel when you entered, the room became warm.<LF>Though I doubted your flyting, I quite liked your form.

Id: [0x002C9414]
Hmm … Expected you to be a bit smoother. No matter. Let's keep at it.

Id: [0x002C9415]
Choke on my bones.

Id: [0x002C9416]
All-Father! Giant Slayer! Doom bringer! Do you remember your fight with the Builder? The Jotun who disguised himself as a craftsman? It wasn't long ago.

Id: [0x002C9417]
I'll be seeing you, old one. Sleep with one eye open!

Id: [0x002C9418]
Have you gleaned enough, O Wise One?

Id: [0x002C9419]
Welcome back, Shield Shaker.

Id: [0x002C941A]
Well said, Raven-Feeder! Name those who may fight beside you!

Id: [0x002C941B]
Yes! I will fight as a thresher through a field of wheat, Mad One.

Id: [0x002C941C]
Einherjar! Here is the battle you died to attain! For Havi. And for Asgard!

Id: [0x002C941D]
War Bringer! The battle is not yet won!

Id: [0x002C941E]
O, for a time, for a time. But you and I both know, the Jotnar are a dull and desperate race.

Id: [0x002C941F]
Neither, High One. I am only a tool. One with hopes to be well used.

Id: [0x002C9420]
Calm, old friend. What's needling you?

Id: [0x002C9421]
Far-Seer, you have sight beyond us all. I have no doubt you will prevail over what troubles you.

Id: [0x002C9422]
You've done this before, Havi.

Id: [0x002C9423]
You entered the well, did you not? And you found what you were looking for?

Id: [0x002C9424]
Tyr is pragmatic, and it serves him well. You should heed him more often.

Id: [0x002C9425]
The wolf, Mad One! What have you done to the wolf!

Id: [0x002C9426]
Step lightly my friend. Those are fragile.

Id: [0x002C9427]
Don't fear, my friend. The problem is no more. I have mixed the proper solution.

Id: [0x002C9428]
If I had announced my desire from the start, you would have hurled me back through that portal.

Id: [0x002C9429]
It's the Jotnar that trouble us now. Have you spoken with the Builder?

Id: [0x002C942A]
You spoke with the Builder? You saw his work?

Id: [0x002C942B]
Havi, you look troubled.

Id: [0x002C942C]
What was your reply?

Id: [0x002C942D]
You didn't refuse him outright?

Id: [0x002C942E]
Your will is my deed, Rune-Writer.

Id: [0x002C942F]
Havi, my gentle jailer. You know we dwarves give nothing away for free.

Id: [0x002C9430]
A hidden fact known only to you, Far-Seer, that I may share in your secret knowledge of the world.

Id: [0x002C9431]
Mad Deceiver, I should neuter you and make you his bride!

Id: [0x002C9432]
At least have the sense to admit you betrayed my trust!

Id: [0x002C9433]
I live to serve, Raven-Feeder.

Id: [0x002C9434]
Doubt not that I shall double my deceptive efforts, O Lord of Cruelty.

Id: [0x002C9435]
At least we trade in goods, not people, Slave Master. I'll be glad to be back underground, away from these angry skies.

Id: [0x002C9436]
Have you found anything?

Id: [0x002C9437]
You tried to avoid responsibility by not making a choice, but that was a choice in itself. And look where it has brought us!

Id: [0x002C9438]
You spoke of sacrifice, but you risked nothing of your own. It was I who shouldered that burden!

Id: [0x002C9439]
You implied you had a plan. I hope with all my heart this wasn't it.

Id: [0x002C943A]
As a cloudless sky, High One.

Id: [0x002C943B]
Our Havi returns.

Id: [0x002C943C]
Well reasoned. They should call you the God of Hindsight. All-knowing after the fact.

Id: [0x002C943D]
You gutless worm. Slayer of my kin. Oath-breaker, spirit-taker! I didn't build this tower to keep your enemies out.

Id: [0x002C943E]
You shaped the nine worlds, but you do not control them.

Id: [0x002C943F]
If you're not careful, you may be the author of your own destruction.

Id: [0x002C9440]
What now, Wise One? We have returned to the place from which we set out. Ragnarok is coming, and we are no safer.

Id: [0x002C9441]
Travel with me, Eivor. We can discuss my tenuous future on the road home.

Id: [0x002C9442]
Would you join me, Eivor? A formality before I'm crowned king. It would give us a chance to solidify this new friendship.

Id: [0x002C9443]
And Eivor, if you can help me right this situation, you'll have a strong alliance with East Anglia. That much I promise.

Id: [0x002C9444]
She called us flaccid!

Id: [0x002C9445]
Must we do this, Eivor?

Id: [0x002C9446]
True strength comes from resolve, Eivor. It speaks to us, a stern voice from within.

Id: [0x002C9447]
Finish this, Eivor. It pains me to watch!

Id: [0x002C9448]
Eivor, I expect your longship crew could help with this attack.

Id: [0x002C9449]
You promised he'd go free!

Id: [0x002C944A]
We'll be there, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C944B]
Eivor, you made it.

Id: [0x002C9456]
Eivor, please…

Id: [0x002C9457]
Blood for blood leaves no warmth in the hearts of men, Eivor. None at all.

Id: [0x002C9458]
Compassion is a virtue suited for anyone, Eivor. Including you. Thank you.

Id: [0x002C9459]
Eivor, I'm so glad you've made it!

Id: [0x002C945A]
Skal, Eivor! Let's have a drink!

Id: [0x002C945B]
Eivor, care for a challenge?

Id: [0x002C945C]
Thought you could destroy my pots, did you? I can always get more pots.

Id: [0x002C945D]
Time's up! You've been bested at last.

Id: [0x002C945E]
You're very strong.

Id: [0x002C945F]
Sorry for this, Eivor. I've had one last glory, I should be happy. I am happy. Thank you.

Id: [0x002C9460]
The boar represents fertility. Did you know that?

Id: [0x002C9461]
You impress me, Eivor. Your battle wisdom, your strength of character, skilled in so many ways.

Id: [0x002C9462]
Ah, you thought… No no, I wasn't serious. Come on now, drink and be merry.

Id: [0x002C9463]
Did you hear what I…?

Id: [0x002C9464]
Wait, did you hear … Did my brother just call me? I think he… You know, I should go. Brothir?

Id: [0x002C9465]
That's worth a verse or two in some skald's song. I'll remember that for all time, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C9466]
Buri's balls! You thought I was my brother?

Id: [0x002C9467]
Eivor, I'm about to address our guests, and I'd like you to be there.

Id: [0x002C9468]
Ah, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C9469]
You lost!

Id: [0x002C946A]
I was a crumbling man, Eivor. Before all this, I thought I'd die a tired old failure.

Id: [0x002C946B]
Thanks to you and everything you've done here.

Id: [0x002C946C]
Thank you, Eivor. I don't know what to say.

Id: [0x002C946D]
Thank you, Eivor. When we first met, I made an oath. I promised you an alliance.

Id: [0x002C946E]
He challenged me, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C946F]
Eivor. You've done East Anglia a great service. I promised you an alliance, and now you have it.

Id: [0x002C9470]
I think I shall be quite comfortable in my role here, Eivor. Thanks to your impeccable judgement.

Id: [0x002C9471]
Eivor. I must say, I expected a rather different outcome. But … no matter. You cannot un-throw a stone from a creek.

Id: [0x002C9472]
Hello, Eivor. Lincolnscire has been … changing certainly.

Id: [0x002C9473]
Eivor. Things certainly are interesting with Hunwald as ealdorman. He's making most of his father's mistakes, but with a passion and honesty I quite admire.

Id: [0x002C9474]
I will. Rest assured.

Id: [0x002C9475]
I have another title, Eivor, I think you know better than most.

Id: [0x002C9476]
I can't presume to know what the Lord has in store for us all. But, barring insurmountable odds, of course I am your ally, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C9477]
Rest assured, I carry both with ease. The Lord saw fit to grant me the strength and clarity I need to rule this shire.

Id: [0x002C9478]
Eivor! Good to see you.

Id: [0x002C9479]
So you elected a man-child to lead us. To be a vacuum of leadership where a solid pillar is needed. God preserve us all.

Id: [0x002C947A]
I do not envy you the position you were in with Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x002C947B]
God praise you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C947C]
Indeed, Eivor! With speed and purpose! You are the axle to my wheel. The spark to my tinder!

Id: [0x002C947D]
I'm his voice of reason, Eivor. And I've told him a thousand times, it's too dangerous for him in Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x002C947E]
You canny fox. That was incredible!

Id: [0x002C947F]
I must void my bladder, Eivor. Then we shall set forth in search of adventures new!

Id: [0x002C9480]
By all the saints and martyrs, Eivor. You are a beast!

Id: [0x002C9481]
We shall triumph, Eivor! We shall win this ugly row!

Id: [0x002C9482]
Continue as you would, Eivor! And if I should expire, avenge me!

Id: [0x002C9485]
Right behind you, shadow-walker.

Id: [0x002C9486]
O, worse than dead. It is my reluctant duty to report the rumor that you were lost in the North, bedding a Dane on some squalid farm.

Id: [0x002C9487]
Ah, where? I have no bloody idea. Is that what you asked me?

Id: [0x002C9488]
Eivor, I realize the strides you've taken to aid me. My oath to you will last an eternity.

Id: [0x002C948A]
Eivor! What news?

Id: [0x002C948B]
For once, we find agreement, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C948C]
Do visit my estate, Eivor. I have something for you. Something I think you'll enjoy.

Id: [0x002C948D]
Eivor, a word if you don't mind.

Id: [0x002C948E]
I wasn't put up, Eivor. I felt compelled to carry on for the good of the shire. Until I knew the truth.

Id: [0x002C948F]
H-hello! Eivor? Is that you?

Id: [0x002C9490]
Eivor, what a pleasant surprise! Would you drink with me?

Id: [0x002C9491]
Eivor, I … can't begin to…

Id: [0x002C9492]
Well, if your homeland is so splendor-ful, why come to England at all?

Id: [0x002C9493]
Ah! Eivor! Help!

Id: [0x002C9494]
Eivor! I am sweating from pit to toe! Do not leave me here.

Id: [0x002C9495]
Birds, Eivor! Has no one told them today is a day of grief--

Id: [0x002C9496]
Well struck, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C9497]
Ah, yes, I am proud to present, Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002C9498]
Hello, Eivor. A pleasure to meet you.

Id: [0x002C9499]
Come inside and rest your bumbling bones, love. Be well, Eivor. And thank you.

Id: [0x002C949A]
Be well, Eivor. And thank you.

Id: [0x002C949B]
Eivor, I'm pleased you came.

Id: [0x002C949C]
Both, if you like! Whatever you fancy! I am generous with the yields of my estate, as you will see.

Id: [0x002C949D]
To be plain, Eivor, a great bear has been badgering my estate for weeks. I must do away with it if only to prevent a future tragedy.

Id: [0x002C949E]
Yes, and I'm so pleased you agreed to come! I suspect you know better than most that I have what it takes to lead this shire.

Id: [0x002C949F]
Yes, that's right, very good! Speaking of Danes I'd like to introduce you to Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94A0]
Perhaps you know each other, as one Dane to another.

Id: [0x002C94A1]
Aelfgar? Eivor? There's something you'll want to see here.

Id: [0x002C94A2]
Eivor, you're skilled enough, and I can't tell you how to handle this, but … please, by God, help me with this!

Id: [0x002C94A3]
Food's no good if there's nowhere to eat it! The houses burn, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94A4]
What a mess. A sea of ashes. I thank you, Eivor, for doing what you could.

Id: [0x002C94A5]
To be sure. But I do not look forward to the toil of…

Id: [0x002C94A6]
The shiremoot will soon begin. Will you join us, Eivor? We'd be comforted by your presence.

Id: [0x002C94A8]
My prayers are fervent and my will is strong, Eivor. If I am ealdorman, I will bring joy to this shire!

Id: [0x002C94A9]
Eivor. I must thank you for your fearless participation in our moot.

Id: [0x002C94AA]
Eivor, I hope it's not untoward of me to solicit your support.

Id: [0x002C94AB]
Yes … that's true. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94AC]
And you, Eivor. May God or … or the gods … protect you.

Id: [0x002C94AD]
Eivor … you have gifted me a great honor, one I hope I can repay.

Id: [0x002C94AE]
Yes, of course. Have no doubt. We are friends, you and I, from this moment forward.

Id: [0x002C94AF]
I have assembled a fyrd there. Quite a large one, in fact. They eagerly await your orders, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94B0]
Today has been a boon, Eivor. In spite of everything, I now know my father's spirit still burns within me. It's thanks to you I know this.

Id: [0x002C94B1]
What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x002C94B2]
The vote's been cast, Eivor. No taking it back.

Id: [0x002C94B3]
Eivor. Is he … is the bishop dead?

Id: [0x002C94B4]
You have my deepest thanks, Eivor. To you I owe all my future happiness and prosperity.

Id: [0x002C94B5]
I believe he has a somewhat different idea of his future. You should talk to him.

Id: [0x002C94B6]
Until next we meet, Eivor. The strength of Lincolnscire is yours should you need it.

Id: [0x002C94B7]
Thank you, Eivor. This means … it means the world to me.

Id: [0x002C94BA]
Eivor! It's Swanburrow. Hello.

Id: [0x002C94BB]
Just as Erke says … a real broga.

Id: [0x002C94BC]
That's not a compliment, Eivor. That's just alarming.

Id: [0x002C94BD]
Yes, you've never come across as one to walk the easy road.

Id: [0x002C94BE]
Eivor, you've come!

Id: [0x002C94BF]
Did you notice what we've done with some of the brickwork? Repurposed from Old Lunden.

Id: [0x002C94C0]
To Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94C1]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94C2]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94C3]
Eivor, we want to apologize. We'd no idea what we were doing, or why.

Id: [0x002C94C4]
So eat, Eivor! Drink! Be merry, this is your celebration too!

Id: [0x002C94C5]
We'd be honored, Eivor. But Lunden needs us now more than ever.

Id: [0x002C94C6]
Mighty high horse, you'd do the same if you were me.

Id: [0x002C94C7]
And what can I call you. Humbler of Thugs? Dane-hammer?

Id: [0x002C94C8]
Three names, three killers. As you said.

Id: [0x002C94CA]
Eivor. You bring good findings, I hope.

Id: [0x002C94CB]
Eivor … what was your impression of Erke?

Id: [0x002C94CC]
Yes, indeed. And thank you for listening.

Id: [0x002C94CD]
I'll return to Saint Paul's just down the road. Godspeed, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94CE]
It's enough to keep us talking. But I'll want to see how well you handle that bow before you go any further.

Id: [0x002C94CF]
You have earned your place at The Arrow's side today. He'll be eager to meet you.

Id: [0x002C94D0]
And you're still only good enough to beat me once.

Id: [0x002C94D1]
It's the riverbank, vinr (friend). Every crooked dealing in this city goes through here.

Id: [0x002C94D2]
And Eivor … don't drop your guard around these docks.

Id: [0x002C94D3]
Eh? Who the fuck are you?

Id: [0x002C94D4]
Ah, The Leech is bled out. And did you catch a name?

Id: [0x002C94D5]
Eivor, make for the steeple!

Id: [0x002C94D6]
Eivor! We're at the door!

Id: [0x002C94D7]
Eivor, we're still inside!

Id: [0x002C94D8]
Follow me to the ramparts, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94D9]
You came to Lunden in search of a friend, Eivor. You found two.

Id: [0x002C94DA]
I say you've earned the right to wear it now.

Id: [0x002C94DB]
I am Estrid, wife of the Lord of Essexe. As you may have heard, my lord is not at home.

Id: [0x002C94DC]
O, that you could, Eivor. For I am sure this hall would shake with our merry wit. But your accord must be reached with him.

Id: [0x002C94DD]
And my beloved Gisele's scolding. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94DE]
Do you believe in true love, Eivor?

Id: [0x002C94DF]
But have you truly? Has a longing burned in your breast, a sweet, lingering pain? Paralyzing you with its sting?

Id: [0x002C94E0]
I must face the wolves at my door before we discuss your favor to Essexe, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94E1]
I … ah … bosoms that? … ah, no. I'm afraid I don't know what that means, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94E2]
That ceased their prattling! A fine outcome, Eivor. The very soul of balance.

Id: [0x002C94E3]
If speech is silver and silence is golden, then you are rich indeed, Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94E4]
I sense you had some fun there, Eivor. And your playful wickedness backfooted my squabbling thegns.

Id: [0x002C94E5]
No, no. I would not inflict the infighting of my thegns upon you, Eivor. Our matters are more delicate.

Id: [0x002C94E6]
Our affairs are more of heart than of state, Eivor. What little passion there was between us faded into bickering long ago.

Id: [0x002C94E7]
We would have our freedom, Eivor. I from my wife, and my wife from Essexe.

Id: [0x002C94E8]
Come find me in the market, Eivor. Our unwelcome guests require food and ale to soften their anger.

Id: [0x002C94E9]
My wife is a gracious and attentive host, Eivor. The only thing that keeps my braying thegns at bay.

Id: [0x002C94EA]
Now it's your turn. Why did you come for me?

Id: [0x002C94EB]
Was it you who gave Ivarr the Boneless his name? I hear talk of his deeds around the campfire, but the name I never understood.

Id: [0x002C94EC]
Come find me at my camp, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94ED]
Have you made your decision?

Id: [0x002C94EE]
Thank you, Eivor. I have much to think on as we journey.

Id: [0x002C94EF]
I will be your shield, Eivor. The springald will protect you. Get my men!

Id: [0x002C94F0]
I am your axe, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94F1]
Come now, Eivor … you can stand against Aelfred's brutes, but you shudder at a maiden's gentle teasing?

Id: [0x002C94F2]
Yes, you noticed as well? That was Thegn Eadred, he insisted. He does worry for me so.

Id: [0x002C94F3]
Now's not the time for such worries, Eivor! Tonight we celebrate! Let's get you some mead!

Id: [0x002C94F4]
Birstan will meet you northeast of Colcestre tomorrow. You have earned all my husband promised, and more.

Id: [0x002C94F5]
Lie with me, Eivor. Under the stars of England. Give me a last bittersweet moment before I leave her shores.

Id: [0x002C94F6]
Yes, these past weeks have been stirring, breathtaking. Your passion and strength, Eivor, I've never met such a … burning soul.

Id: [0x002C94F7]
Do you not know me better, Eivor? Mon petit coeur est blessé. Come, I am suddenly chilly. Let us join the others by the fire.

Id: [0x002C94F8]
Made me feel young again! And I have you to thank. You believed me, though I was a coward. Won't make that mistake again.

Id: [0x002C94F9]
My bow-arm aches! We did well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94FA]
You have brought us all true happiness, Eivor. I thank you, from the bottom of a heart full up with joy.

Id: [0x002C94FB]
Yes, yes. But tell me, Eivor. Did you succumb to my flighted bird's charms? She can turn one atremble with her eyes.

Id: [0x002C94FC]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002C94FD]
I will miss you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C94FE]
Eivor. You have graced us with your presence. My heart is glad to see you.

Id: [0x002C94FF]
He said you found him in a tavern and talked some sense into him.

Id: [0x002C9500]
Do not be! Birstan is a loving and attentive husband. And I expected no life of love and care so late in my summers. You gave that to us.

Id: [0x002C9501]
Eivor, it is good to see you well.

Id: [0x002C9502]
You gave me great happiness, Eivor. Essexe will always be your ally, and I your friend.

Id: [0x002C9503]
[laugh]You're right. You're right. Perhaps I just needed to hear it spoken aloud. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C9504]
Scarper! She's on to us.

Id: [0x002C9505]
My son is not an orphan today. You did more than enough.

Id: [0x002C9506]
Eivor. Compose yourself while you are my guest. My city is not a battlefield.

Id: [0x002C9507]
I don't know your motive, nor what you hope to gain. All I ask is that you finish the work you have begun, before these fallen souls infest England further.

Id: [0x002C9508]
I was starving, my baby son close to death. Would you not steal to save your child?

Id: [0x002C9509]
Well, Eivor, when our three heretics smolder on a heap of ash, we'll down a cup of ale together and share our distaste of Mercians like old friends.

Id: [0x002C950A]
End his terror, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C950B]
The bad reeve, Selwyn. I saw you punish him in the square.

Id: [0x002C950C]
Yes. He hurt my mother to death, then took her good luck charm. Perhaps you found it? A little carved tree? It is all I have to remember her by.

Id: [0x002C950D]
We all want better for our people, don't we, Eivor? Yours and ours?

Id: [0x002C950E]
I am innocent as a lamb. They were The Quill's thugs, and you killed them. Wouldn't want to be in your boots.

Id: [0x002C950F]
They were The Quill's ninnypops. Smart stuff to throw coin at them, they'll be too squiffed to bother you now.

Id: [0x002C9510]
Those were The Quill's meatmops, and you sent them scurrying off with their tails between their legs.

Id: [0x002C9511]
And what would you sacrifice for infinite knowledge?

Id: [0x002C9512]
Watch your step, Eivor. He'll be a hefty corpse in death. Alive he'd be much bigger.

Id: [0x002C9513]
I must thank you before the ale dulls me. By cutting The Order down to size, you have given England a hope of unity.

Id: [0x002C9514]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002C9515]
Eivor. Does The Seax live?

Id: [0x002C9516]
Have you seen Leof? My poor friend. Poor, poor Leof.

Id: [0x002C9517]
It's you. Did you find dear Leof? It is lonely without him.

Id: [0x002C9518]
But why strike him down? Have you no compassion for good men!

Id: [0x002C9519]
Come forth, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C951A]
You had your chance, damn you!

Id: [0x002C951B]
Graybeard! I see you there!

Id: [0x002C951C]
Are you ready to pit your weak wordplay against my strong … one?

Id: [0x002C951D]
Come and flyt me, All-Father, it's time to perform.<LF>I'm the ruler of thunder, you're caught in the storm.

Id: [0x002C951E]
Ha! I have bested the Prince of Poets!

Id: [0x002C951F]
Will you face my brother in flyting, Eivor?

Id: [0x002C9520]
You've returned! Do you wish to challenge milady now?

Id: [0x002C9521]
Ha! You're even worse than they say! Thought it might be gossip, but it's all true!

Id: [0x002C9522]
You're brilliant! You're the smartest person I've ever met.

Id: [0x002C9523]
That was the most incredible flyting I've heard in all my years! You are a wonder!

Id: [0x002C9524]
You return! Do you dare, traveler, face the terrible flyting wrath of Fergal the Faceless?

Id: [0x002C9525]
O, you've made a terrible mistake. Be ready for my finishing blow!

Id: [0x002C9526]
Tch tch tch! Look who it is! None but the High One.

Id: [0x002C9527]
And the High One is he, who will be crushed,<LF>Underneath my flyting skill.

Id: [0x002C9528]
What say you, High One?

Id: [0x002C9529]
The High One returns. Will you be flyting with me again?

Id: [0x002C952A]
You're keeping me spry, High One! I'll give you that. Now leave me to my work.

Id: [0x002C952B]
Ah! Quick to bite back! Be careful, Jungulf!

Id: [0x002C952C]
Got you there, Jungulf! Ha!

Id: [0x002C952D]
Take the gold. You've earned it.

Id: [0x002C952E]
So if you seek to harm me, then simply be kind.

Id: [0x002C952F]
So if you seek to harm me, then simply be kind.

Id: [0x002C9530]
Understood. And thank you for your kind attention.

Id: [0x002C9531]
I was rapt with excitement when you came along.

Id: [0x002C9532]
Have you ever met someone so witty and quick?

Id: [0x002C9533]
Have you ever seen muscles as massive as mine?

Id: [0x002C9534]
You return! Do you wish to flyt against me now? Come, I can take it.

Id: [0x002C9535]
None! I am but an observer of your sparrow-like weakness. And I wish to make it known in verse.

Id: [0x002C9536]
Ah. Come crawling back, have you? Hopefully this time the cat won't have your tongue!

Id: [0x002C9537]
Have you gathered your courage? Are you ready to battle me in flyting?

Id: [0x002C9538]
Enough! You've proven yourself.

Id: [0x002C9539]
You won. I concede defeat. When scops mention me, they will sing of my conquests.

Id: [0x002C953A]
You have proved here that your compassion has a hard and brutal limit.

Id: [0x002C953B]
I applaud your judgement, and thank the Lord He saw fit to clear the clouds of doubt from your mind.

Id: [0x002C953C]
How dare you! Eivor is above reproach!

Id: [0x002C953D]
Yes, quite. In any case, thank you for putting this mystery to rest. I do hope we'll see you at the moot.

Id: [0x002C953E]
Eivor is right, Hunwald. Tomorrow is a new day.

Id: [0x002C953F]
Bribe you? Heavens no! This is a simple gift of thanks. For solving the mystery of Hundbeorht's disappearance.

Id: [0x002C9540]
O? I'm sure there are many tales you can tell from all the roads you've walked.

Id: [0x002C9541]
My Regna, my poor girl, is dead. But, she is avenged. Thanks to you.

Id: [0x002C9542]
Why bother me at all then?

Id: [0x002C9543]
Do you have a coin now?

Id: [0x002C9545]
Eivor leads to victory!

Id: [0x002C9546]
They did. There is no balm for my tortured heart.

Id: [0x002C9547]
Who are you, who risked so much to save me?

Id: [0x002C9548]
I am, thanks to you. Are you here to enjoy the feast?

Id: [0x002C9549]
I didn't catch your name, did I?

Id: [0x002C954A]
Perverter of justice! Who dares execute the king's noose?

Id: [0x002C954C]
I owe you my life.

Id: [0x002C954D]
So a last parting phrase: you're as dim as they come.

Id: [0x002C954E]
To all those whom I speak, they say Eivor's a clod.

Id: [0x002C954F]
It's been a true joy to take a moment away from Lunden's troubles and trials. You've more than earned this.

Id: [0x002C9550]
You deserve every bit of your bet and more. I'll remember some of those insults!

Id: [0x002C9551]
Hmph. Back again? I hope you're in the mood for flyting this time.

Id: [0x002C9552]
I must say I'm impressed. A test for the mind and the body. Take what you've earned.

Id: [0x002C9553]
I could flyt more sweet nothings inside of your ear.<LF>Though I warn you they're some of the lewdest you'll hear.

Id: [0x002C9554]
That was delicious. It's rare that I meet one who can keep pace with me.

Id: [0x002C9555]
What a perfect figure you have … poised, powerful, perfect.

Id: [0x002C9556]
You found me out. I bow to this. But you will not unearth us all, you will not dig deeply enough.

Id: [0x002C9557]
What's it like being tiny, an ant in the loam?

Id: [0x002C9558]
How rude! That won't work.

Id: [0x002C9559]
Would you battle a dragon? Then challenge me not!

Id: [0x002C955A]
Oh-oh! Did you stab him? Mother, can I see?

Id: [0x002C955C]
Blood, but no body? [beat]We must see what has happened to him.

Id: [0x002C9560]
This cleansing of yours ends here.

Id: [0x002C9561]
This cleansing of yours ends here.

Id: [0x002C9565]
I beg your pardon?

Id: [0x002C9567]
I know these words. I've kept the brothers of this letter beneath my pillow. To finally meet my Secret Bard… I must go.

Id: [0x002C9569]
Would you say that your hair could be described as "bracken colored tresses"?

Id: [0x002C956A]
Would you say that your hair could be described as "bracken colored tresses"?

Id: [0x002C956B]
It matters not, return to your work.

Id: [0x002C956C]
It matters not, return to your work.

Id: [0x002C956D]
Stay out of this, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002C956E]
Not bad, Wolf-Kissed! I wager you couldn't drink more than me if you tried.

Id: [0x002C956F]
And have you had enough fun yet?

Id: [0x002C9570]
But he has not cured you of your heathenism, I see. These things are sent to try us, I suppose.

Id: [0x002C9571]
[laugh]Ah! There it is, that dark sense of humor. Blunt as a hammer, eh? Like the one carried by your … your thunder god, the, ah … I don't recall the name.

Id: [0x002C9572]
Maybe not, but I'm not saying shit until I hear something that makes me believe you are who you claim.

Id: [0x002C9573]
Could we try the kidnap again? Much of the planning is done. It would only take a more trustworthy overseer.

Id: [0x002C9574]
Of Eluric's? Is he alright, the poor boy!

Id: [0x002C9575]
That is not for me to decide, for I am not the one who summoned you. If you follow, I will lead you to him.

Id: [0x002C9576]
I know Aelfred well enough to spot a bloody lie when I hear it. If he did send you, he was standing tall and proud.

Id: [0x002C9577]
How quaint that you think so.

Id: [0x002C9578]
I am here in the clouds, while you crawl on the ground!<LF>Like a sad little worm, making a pitiful sound!

Id: [0x002C9579]
Come find me when you've honed your skills.

Id: [0x002C957A]
Ready to try your luck?

Id: [0x002C957B]
You're brilliant! Yes! More!

Id: [0x002C957E]
O Starlight, my Starlight. A swift death by a sharp sting separates us, both by lip and by heart.

Id: [0x002C9595]
I've kept your letters under my pillow to give me dreams as sweet as your words. Now I know, my love is sweet as apples.

Id: [0x002C9596]
My Starlight, it's as if my heart is to burst with this happiness. My love requited.

Id: [0x002C9597]
What do you think of all this? A little dull, in my view.

Id: [0x002C959E]
Yes, another joins the throng.

Id: [0x002C959F]
Another!

Id: [0x002C95A0]
They roar! Do you hear them? A chorus of fire!

Id: [0x002C95A2]
The abbess sought to destroy all Christian texts in the city. Rid Jorvik of their ideals.

Id: [0x002C95A3]
The abbess, she sought to destroy all Christian texts in the city. Rid Jorvik of their ideals.

Id: [0x002C95B1]
England? That's a fair distance.

Id: [0x002C95BA]
Do you remember Ingrid the chicken? The one that the wretched old hermit woman used to keep? I stole her, you know.

Id: [0x002C95C4]
Gorm … dead? B-by your hand?

Id: [0x002C95C6]
O, I will! Yet I would first join the villagers at their fire. They tell stories and I like to listen, though I do not hear.

Id: [0x002C95C8]
No need to hide now, Olav. Gorm is dead.

Id: [0x002C95C9]
No need to hide now, Olav. Gorm is dead.

Id: [0x002C95CA]
He paid a bloody price for broken honor. I will not say more. Return to your sister.

Id: [0x002C95CB]

Id: [0x002C95CC]
Storytime? Telling sagas of their own?

Id: [0x002C95CD]
Storytime? Telling sagas of their own?

Id: [0x002C95D2]
It is. Are you ready to head back?

Id: [0x002C95D6]
Let us go.

Id: [0x002C95DA]
Do not take long, as we must return before the winter storms stir the cold sea.

Id: [0x002C95DC]
Nessa, is your ship headed for England?

Id: [0x002C95DD]
Nessa, is your ship headed for England?

Id: [0x002C95DE]
Yes, I need to go back.

Id: [0x002C95DF]
Yes, I need to go back.

Id: [0x002C95E0]
No, I must yet perform a few tasks.

Id: [0x002C95E1]
No, I must yet perform a few tasks.

Id: [0x002C95E3]
I once saw a Dane in Gautland boil bear meat for his supper. Can you believe that? He boiled it! Disgusting.

Id: [0x002C95F8]
I can linger a few days in port. Speak to me when you're ready to sail.

Id: [0x002C95FC]
I will sail with you. Let's go.

Id: [0x002C95FD]
I will sail with you. Let's go.

Id: [0x002C9600]
A few tasks remain. But I will ready myself and return.

Id: [0x002C9601]
A few tasks remain. But I will ready myself and return.

Id: [0x002C9603]
Jora of Jorvik! You shirked your work for quite some time!

Id: [0x002C9604]
Sister, let us celebrate! Gorm Kjotvesson is no more! Slain by Eivor Raven-friend. Eivor Forest-strider. Eivor Olav-saver!

Id: [0x002C9609]
I had a long-standing blood feud with Gorm and his clan. It is now laid to rest.

Id: [0x002C960A]
I had a long-standing blood feud with Gorm and his clan. It is now laid to rest.

Id: [0x002C960B]
I … I do not disagree. Gorm was a madman and a troll, indeed. But he paid us in silver, and that was enough.

Id: [0x002C960E]
O, the skalds will sing of this day! How Eivor traveled far and wide, hunting Gorm along the world's rim!

Id: [0x002C961A]
If Eivor does not show soon, I am packing up and riding home.

Id: [0x002C961B]
Shut your blowhole, Broder. You want me to tell Halfdan how easily you break an oath?

Id: [0x002C961C]
Ah, Brother! Did you forget she has Halfdan Jarl's ear? Stop talking if you know what's good for you.

Id: [0x002C961D]
Is Lunden as dark and grubby as they say?

Id: [0x002C961F]
With that aside, we are making great strides to improve the lives of its people.

Id: [0x002C9621]
He's so brave! Like a young King Aelfred.

Id: [0x002C9622]
He'll crack his head like a fresh hen's egg!

Id: [0x002C9625]
Loins, eh? Or I could get it for you? I would hate to see such a ferocious flame snuffed out.[NO LOC CHANGE NEEDED]

Id: [0x002C9626]
Loins, eh? Or I could get it for you? I would hate to see such a ferocious flame snuffed out.[NO LOC CHANGE NEEDED]

Id: [0x002C9627]
O, it is high. Why is it so high?

Id: [0x002C9628]
I'm going to do it! You see if I don't.

Id: [0x002C9629]
I will show her I love her! [beat]Or die trying!

Id: [0x002C962D]
Thank you for the flower. It is very beautiful.

Id: [0x002C962E]
Now we are betrothed, and I will grow up to be a great king and you will be my fair lady.

Id: [0x002C9630]
What say you, Daughter? Do you think him a worthy suitor? He risked so much to declare his love.

Id: [0x002C9631]
Come, dearest.

Id: [0x002C9633]
Still got a soft spot for her, don't you, Brother?

Id: [0x002C9634]
Him and Eivor? Ha! Lower your aim, friend, you'll have better luck.

Id: [0x002C9635]
Like these two fine fellows! Brothir and Broder, was it?

Id: [0x002C9636]
Careful, Saxon. We're here for the killing, not to make friends.

Id: [0x002C9638]
You can always fail. Believing you cannot is the first step.

Id: [0x002C9639]
There's a cheery thought.

Id: [0x002C963D]
Them sissy-britches? Fat chance. So, do you want to race or not? I've beaten everyone else in the whole world.

Id: [0x002C963F]
Dead? From running?

Id: [0x002C9640]
Dead? From running?

Id: [0x002C9641]
In that case … let's run!

Id: [0x002C9642]
In that case … let's run!

Id: [0x002C9645]
Lord forgive me…

Id: [0x002C9647]
Peace, or you'll feel my blade in your guts.

Id: [0x002C9648]
Peace, or you'll feel my blade in your guts.

Id: [0x002C9649]
Wh-what do you mean to do with him?

Id: [0x002C964D]
Now.

Id: [0x002C964E]
Now.

Id: [0x002C9650]
Mary on a donkey! You deserve the bloody thing. It's not worth my hide. Much as my wife would love to be a widow.

Id: [0x002C9653]
If the trinket is for Aelfred, I think I'll just take it.

Id: [0x002C9654]
If the trinket is for Aelfred, I think I'll just take it.

Id: [0x002C965B]
We meet again, heathen! You should have killed me when you had the chance!

Id: [0x002C965D]
A mistake I will not make twice.

Id: [0x002C965E]
A mistake I will not make twice.

Id: [0x002C9661]
Tears, anger, vengeance suggests someone wronged. The despair of a spurned lover can rattle the earth?

Id: [0x002C9662]
Tears, anger, vengeance suggests someone wronged. The despair of a spurned lover can rattle the earth?

Id: [0x002C9663]
One down, one to go. The other should be somewhere in the keep.

Id: [0x002C9668]
Indeed.

Id: [0x002C9669]
One down, one to go. The other should be near the boats.

Id: [0x002C966B]
On my way.

Id: [0x002C966C]
On my way.

Id: [0x002C966D]
Now the boats. We burn them to the waterline.

Id: [0x002C966E]
Now the boats. We burn them to the waterline.

Id: [0x002C9671]
No more sailing for these Saxons.

Id: [0x002C9677]
On my way.

Id: [0x002C9678]
On my way.

Id: [0x002C967A]
By Thor, we're not done yet!

Id: [0x002C967B]
Stay strong! Victory is close at hand!

Id: [0x002C967D]
Damn these Saxon dogs! Don't they give up?

Id: [0x002C9681]
Keep your wits about you, Soma. Don't get careless now.

Id: [0x002C9682]
Keep your wits about you, Soma. Don't get careless now.

Id: [0x002C9683]
Stand with me, Ubba. We'll turn the tide.

Id: [0x002C9684]
Stand with me, Ubba. We'll turn the tide.

Id: [0x002C9685]
Hello? Is someone out there? I am young, nubile, and yet untouched by another's … hand.

Id: [0x002C9687]
All I want is my freedom. My flowing blonde locks to feel the fragrant breeze. My ample bosom, the warmth of the sun.

Id: [0x002C968B]
Wine? Come now, we will do this over ale. That will give us a good measure of who can better fight its lure.

Id: [0x002C9691]
The breadbasket of Wessex. Land of plenty.

Now I must see about destroying Fulke's supplies.

Id: [0x002C9697]
I shall try.

Id: [0x002C969D]
I will speak of the wine and watch for their reactions. That may lead me to The Vault.

Id: [0x002C969E]
I will speak of the wine and watch for their reactions. That may lead me to The Vault.

Id: [0x002C96A7]
Very well. I will return with some wine.

Id: [0x002C96A8]
Very well. I will return with some wine.

Id: [0x002C96AC]
Worry not. We have tracked The Vault here. He is someone on the council.

Whose blessing? I see no pitchfork-shaking father or weeping mother.

Until then, it is important that I investigate without raising suspicion. I need your help.

Id: [0x002C96B7]
Eivor, please build my bureau.

Id: [0x002C96B8]
It would be greatly be appreciated if you could give me housing

Id: [0x002C96B9]
My house needs improvement

Id: [0x002C96BA]
What? Why?

Id: [0x002C96BB]
Drink yourself into a drunken fit.

Id: [0x002C96BC]
Drink yourself into a drunken fit.

Id: [0x002C96BD]
I can't be seen doing that. You'll have to find another way.

Id: [0x002C96C2]
(unintelligible)[My mother and father walk together in Annwn. Cynon helped raise me.]

Id: [0x002C96C3]
Have you a family, Brigid?

Id: [0x002C96C4]
Have you a family, Brigid?

Id: [0x002C96C5]
Lord, your light falters! Please do not forsake me. Is the tenebrous pall of darkness my fate?

Id: [0x002C96CD]
All quiet.

Id: [0x002C96CE]
Nothing to report but birdsong and fox shit.

Id: [0x002C96CF]
No sign of the Danes. Not sure what Fulke's worried about.

Id: [0x002C96D1]
You will regret this mercy!

Id: [0x002C96D4]
Passing through my lands, Hjorr met my father. The two got on like tinder and flame. And soon we were married.

Id: [0x002C96D5]
You see, Stowe? Befriend a king and one is set for life. What could be simpler?

Id: [0x002C96D6]
And how do you like England, Ljufvina?

Id: [0x002C96D7]
Isn't it pleasant, getting out of the city and into the wild?

Id: [0x002C96D8]
It's too empty out here. No sound but the birds and the wind in the grass.

Id: [0x002C96DA]
How will we ever share this land if we kill one another so readily?

Id: [0x002C96DB]
The weak fall beneath the strong. It has always been so.

Id: [0x002C96DC]
No. There is more to this world than that. There has to be.

Id: [0x002C96DD]
So many dead. Erke, did we do the right thing here?

Id: [0x002C96DE]
At least at home, we've the law to guide us. Out here, the only rule is the sword.

Id: [0x002C96DF]
God will speak to me, I know it. He will show me my true path.

Id: [0x002C96E0]
Leave me be, I am deep in contemplation.

Id: [0x002C96E1]
I must follow His beacon.

Id: [0x002C96E2]
Fulke's men will have to fight with twigs.

Id: [0x002C96E4]
Good work, Eivor.

Id: [0x002C96E8]
Burn this town to the ground!

Id: [0x002C96E9]
Burn this town to the ground!

Id: [0x002C96EA]
Soon there will be nothing left.

Id: [0x002C96EB]
Soon there will be nothing left.

Id: [0x002C96EC]
She will not hide from me!

Id: [0x002C96ED]
She will not hide from me!

Id: [0x002C96F5]
Brig's Ma and Pa were the last high priestess and ealdorman. They've since passed on, but the current ealdorman looks out for her.

Id: [0x002C96F7]
You talk of false victories to me, old man? A sad old bear who destroyed his honor with one bent knee?

Id: [0x002C96F8]
The further I sail from this place, the louder I will sing.

Id: [0x002C96FB]
May Aegir bless your voyage.

Id: [0x002C96FD]
It is easy to lose one's way on the road to glory. Do not let false victories blind you to what is true.

Id: [0x002C96FF]
No, you must be his better half.

Id: [0x002C9701]
I will be his anchor, lord.

Id: [0x002C9702]
I will be his anchor, lord.

Id: [0x002C9703]
Seventeen winters ago, I opened my door to you, Eivor. And now … your only thanks is to rob me?

Id: [0x002C9705]
I should have left you to the wolves.

Id: [0x002C9708]
Sad old elk. Do not carry his words with you to England. He brought this day upon himself.

Id: [0x002C970B]
I know.

Id: [0x002C970C]
I know.

Id: [0x002C970D]
How could I have been such a fool…

Id: [0x002C970E]
The town's funds in decline. A treasurer's hand in the coffers. It is all connected. For these reasons, I think Hjorr is The Vault.

Id: [0x002C971A]
So to England, glory and destiny!

Id: [0x002C971C]
To England! Or Valhalla!

Id: [0x002C971D]
To England!

Id: [0x002C971E]
To England!

Id: [0x002C971F]
Yes … yes you're right. And the wine?

Id: [0x002C9721]
Of all the councilmen, he knew the wine had not yet arrived. When I offered some, he flat out refused, insisting it be saved for the guests.

Id: [0x002C9722]

Id: [0x002C9724]
Beg him, please. He must remove the curse! The forest and fields have risen up against me, red in tooth and claw.

Id: [0x002C972D]
O, my ickle Dandelion! Where are you, Dandy?

Id: [0x002C972E]
Here girl! Come out, Dandy-do!

Id: [0x002C972F]
You'll burn! Burn up to a widdle crisp! Come out!

Id: [0x002C9737]
I should like to meet this ealdorman of yours, if our kinfolk are to be joined.

Id: [0x002C9738]

Id: [0x002C973A]
You will be back in Northwic soon enough, Broder. Vengeance will put fire to Eivor's heels.

Id: [0x002C9756]
A union forged in love! Come, we'll go find him. O, and don't blame me if he's heard a tale or two about you. What about it, Brig?

Id: [0x002C9759]
(unintelligible)[No thanks, you two are bags of hot air around each other. Let Eivor get the earful.]

Id: [0x002C975C]
To be honest, I think he's upset he didn't see the problem sooner. His pride is slow to heal.

Id: [0x002C9761]
Filigreed gold, centered with a rock crystal and enamel plaque. A miniature of our most beatific Lord, Jesus Christ … and…

Id: [0x002C9762]
And you're going to just keep it, aren't you?

Id: [0x002C9764]
Bollocks.

Id: [0x002C9765]
How rare?

Id: [0x002C9766]
How rare?

Id: [0x002C9767]
You do. And also this. Every treasure he has, I'll take. Every poet who writes him into song will sing threefold of me.

Dandelion Puff, you're no dog.

This way, girl! Let's get out of here!

Id: [0x002CA0B6]
This way, girl! Let's get out of here!

Id: [0x002CA0BD]
Friend, I soon will sleep in the comforting arms of the Lord. Can you please look after my widdle doggie-dog?

Id: [0x002CA0C8]
You may have it. But tell your king it will all be mine soon enough. His jewels. His treasures. His city. His throne.

Id: [0x002CA0C9]

Id: [0x002CA0D0]
[gasping]My jarl! I'm … sorry…

Id: [0x002CA0D3]
If you wish to crown yourself King of Wessex, Portcestre must fall. An alliance here serves us both.

Id: [0x002CA0DE]
Yes![ONO: pained noise] I'll roll my fat corpse up this hill if need be.

Id: [0x002CA0DF]
What? All the way to the top? And, you intend to go alone in your state?

Id: [0x002CA0E0]

O dear! It feels like it's been so long!

What are you doing here? I was looking for you.

Id: [0x002CA0ED]
What are you doing here? I was looking for you.

It's dishonorable to leave a pregnant woman to the elements. Why does the baby's father not come to you?

It's dishonorable to leave a pregnant woman to the elements. Why does the baby's father not come to you?

Id: [0x002CA0F1]
What!

Id: [0x002CA0F3]
Listen to her, Hjorr. She has dealt with their kind before.

Id: [0x002CA0F4]
These people sent the Red Hand after her, ready to shed blood in your streets to keep themselves a secret.

Id: [0x002CA0F5]

This is the letter that was sent to our home. The Needle, The Firebrand, The Vault.

Id: [0x002CA0FA]
But they failed.

Id: [0x002CA0FB]
But they failed.

Id: [0x002CA0FC]
They belong to a group called The Order of Ancients. These are their assumed names. Our leads.

You need not help me, but who am I to look a gift Dane in the mouth.

Id: [0x002CA0FF]
The baby's father is a god. Moccus of the Wood saw me on Solstice and wooed me with his song.

Id: [0x002CA100]
Aye, is that so shocking? Mary grew Christ from the touch of God. I heard of a Dane god who laid down with a horse.

Id: [0x002CA101]
Child out of wedlock. [sigh]I should raise the babe out here. Safe from town gossip. Raising it as a bastard. How they'll talk.

Id: [0x002CA107]
I am ready for my final journey. Let me see what lies beyond.

Id: [0x002CA108]
I decide your fate today, Saxon.

Id: [0x002CA109]
I decide your fate today, Saxon.

Id: [0x002CA10A]
Those bloody scoundrels again!

Id: [0x002CA10B]
And what is your stake in this? Are you some sort of wandering mercenary?

Id: [0x002CA10D]
I have seen rebel groups like this before. They sit and wait, and the moment you lower your guard, they spring up like weeds.

Dandelion Puff upset some kindling. Bad girl! Everything burst into flames! I barely escaped.

Id: [0x002CA114]
O dear…

Id: [0x002CA115]
If left alone, they will take Jorvik out from under you. Not what you want. Not what Halfdan wants.

Id: [0x002CA116]
If left alone, they will take Jorvik out from under you. Not what you want. Not what Halfdan wants.

Id: [0x002CA117]
Hjorr … send funds to procure food and ale for Faravid's men. And make sure there's enough left over for the feast.

Id: [0x002CA118]
But it's as I said, we don't have--

Id: [0x002CA119]
Find it. I have spoken.

Id: [0x002CA11B]
He tells me to find more silver. Where, in a dragon's hoard?

Id: [0x002CA11C]
Come, I will take you back to Ljufvina. She will know where to begin.

Id: [0x002CA122]
You have not seen the half of my wrath! How many of my men now lie dead on account of this glory-hoarder?

Id: [0x002CA127]
If this is what a Raven Clan victory looks like, I cannot wait to see what happens when you lose.

Id: [0x002CA128]
You can triumph yet. Go with the wisdom of Odin, the power of Thor, the wit of Freyja. Go and find your brother.

Id: [0x002CA12B]
It brings me no pleasure to fight my own people, but a debt is a debt. We will leave immediately.

Id: [0x002CA12C]
Besides, they're men of Wessex, Aelfred's folk. No brothers of yours.

Id: [0x002CA12D]
Erke, Stowe, ride there ahead of me. Together we will bring them down.

Id: [0x002CA12E]
Erke, Stowe, ride there ahead of me. Together we will bring them down.

Onward! Take the Saxons' camp!

Id: [0x002CA133]
Onward! Take the Saxons' camp!

Id: [0x002CA143]
And what has Dane friendship done for Christian Mercia? Unseated God-right kings for puppet rulers?

Id: [0x002CA146]
So-called puppet kings keep your lands safe and your bellies full. I ask no thanks, only hospitality.

Calm, Lord Ricsige. Audun is dead.

Id: [0x002CA159]
Calm, Lord Ricsige. Audun is dead.

Id: [0x002CA15A]
He had help from two others. Grigorii, the dockmaster, and Ingeborg, the abbess.

Id: [0x002CA15B]
And you, Eivor. You were after these conspirators from the moment you arrived?

Id: [0x002CA15D]
Yes, though I could not let it be known. This group can reach any person, permeate the walls of any city.

Id: [0x002CA15E]
Yes, though I could not let it be known. This group can reach any person, permeate the walls of any city.

Id: [0x002CA161]
Fine. I will see to it that Hjorr distributes the silver evenly.

Id: [0x002CA162]
I say we fund the war. Give Halfdan's men what they need to turn the tide. Future Danes and Saxons will thank us for it.

Id: [0x002CA169]
You will hear no argument from me.

Id: [0x002CA16A]
Then it will be done. Hjorr will see that your army gets what they need.

Id: [0x002CA16B]
Is this a bitter farewell?

Id: [0x002CA16C]
Is this a bitter farewell?

Id: [0x002CA16D]
You remain a friend, Eivor. Let that be clear.

Id: [0x002CA16E]
We still can be.

Id: [0x002CA171]
You sneak.

Id: [0x002CA180]
I am with you.

Id: [0x002CA191]
Searching. Yes. Always searching. And never finding, the mean, mean bacraut (asshole).

Id: [0x002CA192]
Why camps? Is he settling here? Or searching for something?

Anything Olav can tell, Olav will tell, my new and big friend!

Id: [0x002CA19A]
That is a mystery he will not tell. [laugh]But my guess is the best guess. He seeks the door to Jotunheim.

Id: [0x002CA19C]
A talking crystal?

Id: [0x002CA19D]
A talking crystal?

Id: [0x002CA19E]
What is he digging for?

Id: [0x002CA19F]
What is he digging for?

Id: [0x002CA1A2]
Gorm carries with him a crystal that talks. It tells him where to go and what to do!

Id: [0x002CA1A3]
It is truth! The elf-stone tells him to seek, and so he seeks. And when it says dig, he digs. Such a mystery!

Id: [0x002CA1A4]
Olav, would you tell me something?

Id: [0x002CA1A5]
Olav, would you tell me something?

Id: [0x002CA1A6]
Why would Gorm cross the sea to this nameless wilderness? It seems a great risk for so little.

Woodsmoke and ash. Rued's men have been here.

Woodsmoke and ash. Rued's men have been here.

They are well-guarded, you say?

Id: [0x002CA1B7]
They are well-guarded, you say?

Id: [0x002CA1B9]
I shall think it over. [beat]Njal!

I am not here to fight you, Bjorn. I am Eivor of the Raven Clan, and I offer you a seat in our hall.

Id: [0x002CA1BC]
I am not here to fight you, Bjorn. I am Eivor of the Raven Clan, and I offer you a seat in our hall.

Id: [0x002CA1C0]
Take this. Some goods to get you started.

I do not understand their language. Can you translate for me?

Id: [0x002CA1C3]
I don't understand their language. Can you translate for me?

Id: [0x002CA1DB]
And where do we find ourselves? Riding into the fens to beg a horde of frightened farmers for aid.

Id: [0x002CA1DC]
We had a connection, that bird and I. I would come by and feed it seed and worms I had picked up on the way to see her.

Id: [0x002CA1E4]
Raiders! Ready your weapons! Their silver is ours for the taking!

Id: [0x002CA1E5]
Raiders! Ready your weapons! Their silver is ours for the taking!

Id: [0x002CA1F1]
These men did not come for the fame of defeating a legendary berserker.

Id: [0x002CA1F2]
No need, no. We talk with signs. Just walk up to a trader and start trading.

A manor. Hjorr and Ljufvina have done well for themselves.

Id: [0x002CA1FB]
A manor. Hjorr and Ljufvina have done well for themselves.

Id: [0x002CA20D]
Please! Don't do this.

Id: [0x002CA20E]
It's a misunderstanding. That's all. I'll pay.

Id: [0x002CA20F]
You had your chance.

Id: [0x002CA213]
Faster! Or would you prefer another thrashing?

Id: [0x002CA228]
Helgi, that fine honey mead you have. Pour me a horn, would you?

Id: [0x002CA229]
I have ale for you, Aud. But no mead.

Id: [0x002CA22A]
What? We had a whole cask.

Id: [0x002CA22B]
Gorm smashed it over Olav's head, right there in the storehouse.

Id: [0x002CA22C]
Thor's hammer, I am done with this place. Send me home, Helgi.

Id: [0x002CA231]
No, you tell Gorm he got out of the storehouse.

Id: [0x002CA232]
Gorm is not here. So until he is, I won't worry on it.

Id: [0x002CA233]
You should. You are the one who lost him.

Id: [0x002CA234]
Maybe so, but I am sailing back to England at first light. May Loki eat this place.

Id: [0x002CA235]
You. I expect your payment by next nightfall. Do not fail me.

Id: [0x002CA23F]
Hmm … locked.

Id: [0x002CA240]
Hmm … locked.

Remember the girl Astrid, Eivor? I asked her to come with me when we left Norway.

Id: [0x002CA24A]
But she was to wed another. A deal her father had arranged. What are children if not pawns to their father's ambitions?

Id: [0x002CA24B]
I even pondered the names of our children. Me, the free-spirit, the war-seeker! I was a stranger even to myself, thinking of her.

Id: [0x002CA24D]
But there was a stony look in her eyes when she told me she was going to go through with her father's wishes.

Id: [0x002CA24E]
She had a strong heart, that girl. She always knew what was the right thing to do. [laughing]And I was not it.

Id: [0x002CA259]
My scars tell good tales. Take this one … a hole through my chest and out my back. Just missed my heart.

Id: [0x002CA25C]
[gasping]I bear this pain with grace, Freyja, but please, show me a sign…[wince of pain]

Id: [0x002CA25F]
The ram could push through.

[pained]Ngh!

Id: [0x002CA268]
The pain surges, but I must finish the ritual.

Id: [0x002CA26B]
Seer!

Id: [0x002CA26C]
Seer!

Id: [0x002CA26F]
What a delightful feast.

Id: [0x002CA270]
Audun has outdone himself.

Id: [0x002CA271]
He has indeed. The High Reeve of Jorvik has a bright future ahead if he keeps this up.

Id: [0x002CA279]
Not yet. I will return shortly with my decision.

Id: [0x002CA27A]
Not yet. I will return shortly with my decision.

Id: [0x002CA27B]
I believe I have.

Id: [0x002CA27C]
I believe I have.

Id: [0x002CA27D]
Rada, my blood and pain are the will of Frejya and Freyr. Speak now. What do you need of me?

Id: [0x002CA27E]
The seer! Is she well?

Id: [0x002CA27F]
A wee misunderstanding between myself and the good folk of the hamlets hereabouts. Your name, good-kin?

Id: [0x002CA280]
Why were you tied up?

Id: [0x002CA281]
Why were you tied up?

Id: [0x002CA287]
O, hello, Eivor. Good day.

Id: [0x002CA297]
Do you mean now? Right now?

Id: [0x002CA299]
I did ask, didn't I? You're right. Lead the way, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CA29A]
Take a break, Randvi. Let's make for Grantebridgescire and get you out of this musty room.

Id: [0x002CA29B]
Randvi, take a break. Let us make for Grantebridgescire and get you out of this musty room.

Id: [0x002CA29C]
Of course. You said you were tired of all this, so why not? Stretch your legs and fill your lungs.

Id: [0x002CA29D]
Of course. You said you were tired of all this, so why not stretch your legs and fill your lungs.

Id: [0x002CA2A2]
(giggle)

Id: [0x002CA2AC]
Watch your left!

Id: [0x002CA2AD]
You watch YOUR left!

Id: [0x002CA2AE]
I'm trying to help!

Id: [0x002CA2AF]
Ubba! Do you have sight of Eivor!

Id: [0x002CA2B0]
Are you her nursemaid? Why do you ask?

Id: [0x002CA2B1]
Old habits. Pay me no mind.

Id: [0x002CA2B2]
I've killed twenty Saxons already!

Id: [0x002CA2B3]
I lost count around thirty.

Id: [0x002CA2B4]
Hmph … well … I wasn't counting the short ones!

Id: [0x002CA2B8]
I have done all I could to help him, Eivor. The rest is up to you.

Id: [0x002CA2C4]
Brother! Brother!

Id: [0x002CA2C5]
Brother! Brother!

Id: [0x002CA2C6]
I'm here for you. I have you.

Id: [0x002CA2C7]

Get Sigurd to a boat. I'll hold them off till you are safely away.

Id: [0x002CA2DE]
Get Sigurd to a boat. I will hold them off till you are safely away.

Sigurd was here once, but no longer. Where has Fulke taken him?

Sigurd was here once, but no longer. Where has Fulke taken him?

Archers! To the walls!

What has she done to you?

Id: [0x002CA2ED]
What has she done to you?

Id: [0x002CA2FE]
Polished stone and strange markings. What is this place?

Id: [0x002CA2FF]
Polished stone and strange markings. What is this place?

Id: [0x002CA33E]
Are you? You show up here, like this… These people tried to kill me!

Id: [0x002CA344]
I do not know what it is, but these men were ready to kill me for it.

Id: [0x002CA347]
You know him…?

Id: [0x002CA349]
At the royal hall. I will take you there.

Id: [0x002CA350]
It's good to find you well, Hjorr. Both of you.

Id: [0x002CA351]
It is good to find you well, Hjorr. Both of you.

Id: [0x002CA352]
And I might even feel inclined to reward you myself.

Id: [0x002CA358]
…then it may be in my interest to give you aid. I understand.

Id: [0x002CA359]
…then it may be in my interest to give you aid. I understand.

Id: [0x002CA35D]
Follow me.

Id: [0x002CA35E]
Follow me.

Id: [0x002CA361]
Apples! Eivor, wait until you try the cider. You like cider, eh, Tewdwr? Cider?

Id: [0x002CA365]
How dare you say such a thing?

Id: [0x002CA366]
You would have done the same in my place, Ubba!

Id: [0x002CA367]
You would have done the same in my place, Ubba!

Id: [0x002CA368]
I will show you all the mercy you showed Ivarr!

Id: [0x002CA369]
You will again know the strength of the Sons of Ragnarr!

Id: [0x002CA36B]
Aw, sad shot!

Id: [0x002CA36C]
Ooo, you missed bad!

Id: [0x002CA373]
We're honored to have her join the Raven Clan. But your lush landscape will be hard to match.

We're honored to have her join the Raven Clan. But your lush landscape will be hard to match.

Id: [0x002CA379]
It really is lovely here. I have not been this far east of the settlement. Isn't that awful?

Id: [0x002CA37A]
O, are we not taking the longship?

Id: [0x002CA37C]
Not at all. So long as I get some air and sun, I will be fine. I spend too much of my day in the longhouse.

Id: [0x002CA37E]
Is swimming not an option?

Id: [0x002CA37F]
A boat or a horse would always do, but I am not opposed to the more traditional methods.

Id: [0x002CA380]
Is that a problem?

Id: [0x002CA381]
Is that a problem?

Id: [0x002CA382]
We will need to cross the river at some point if we want to enter Grantebridgescire. If you know a better way, I would love to hear it.

[inhale]Gods, do you smell that? The earth and the air. It is good to be out here.

Id: [0x002CA38A]
You think safety "awful"?

Id: [0x002CA38B]
You think safety "awful"?

Id: [0x002CA38C]
Eivor, there. What is that?

Id: [0x002CA38E]
A Roman marvel. I will not soon forget this site.

Id: [0x002CA38F]
This is where the Summer Army retreated when Grantebridge was lost. They seem to have resettled the city in full now.

Id: [0x002CA398]
What has happened?

Id: [0x002CA3A3]
Ah, it's bigger than I imagined. Rustic, woody, beautiful. And everything seems quite new.

Id: [0x002CA3A5]
Well, it is impressive. Some interesting architectural ideas here too.

Id: [0x002CA3A6]
And here we are. Welcome to Grantebridge. We should make our way to the longhouse.

Wait here a moment. I'll be back.

We can go.

We can go.

My widdle doggie-woggie! She's still in the house! I rushed out, but she didn't follow me!

Id: [0x002CA3BF]
Dandelion Puff?

Id: [0x002CA3C0]
Dandelion Puff?

Id: [0x002CA3C1]
Please, Eivor. Not the longship.

Id: [0x002CA3C7]
This water smells … off.

Id: [0x002CA3CA]
Right.

Id: [0x002CA3CB]
Right.

Id: [0x002CA3D2]
You could keep it. Comb your hair. Or, I could comb it if you like.

Id: [0x002CA3D3]
If this comb is worth nothing to you, what shall I do with it?

Id: [0x002CA3D4]
If this comb is worth nothing to you, what shall I do with it?

Careful, Randvi!

Id: [0x002CA3DD]
Careful, Randvi!

Id: [0x002CA3DF]
I do not wish to.

Id: [0x002CA3E0]
You get used to it.

Id: [0x002CA3E1]
You get used to it.

Id: [0x002CA3E2]
That was thrilling!

Id: [0x002CA3E4]
Randvi the Ravager. I should clear a seat on my longship for you.

Randvi the Ravager. I should clear a seat on my longship for you.

Id: [0x002CA3E6]
Wolf Pack! Onwards!

Id: [0x002CA3E8]
They ran, four warriors, like four limbs of one clawing body. Each limb built to kill! Destroy!

Id: [0x002CA3E9]
They arrived at the village, torches, axes, and blades at the ready. Ready for the slaughter.

Id: [0x002CA3EA]
All limbs tensed, springing and ready to strike!

Id: [0x002CA3EC]
His body shatters on impact. Gods! His bones burst through his skin.

Id: [0x002CA3ED]
Bam! An arrow flies right into the body of an enemy!

Id: [0x002CA3F0]
Look at you. A battle-hardened vikingr! Just what we need.

Id: [0x002CA3F2]
One day we will be the greatest warriors beneath our banner. Skalds will write songs of the Wolf Pack.

Id: [0x002CA3F3]
O, and what do you need this battle-hardened warrior for?

Id: [0x002CA3F4]
O, and what do you need this battle-hardened warrior for?

Id: [0x002CA3F5]
Yes! With your help, we slaughtered the Raven Clan for good!

Id: [0x002CA424]
Men like this are more dangerous than any magic. They kill wisdom.

Id: [0x002CA427]
There was a curse here long before I came along. A curse of ignorance that infects all of Midgard.

Id: [0x002CA429]
I try to use my knowledge to help others. I am only a threat to those who fear the unknown, of which there are many.

Id: [0x002CA42C]
Are you the warlock who laid a curse on this land?

Id: [0x002CA42D]
Are you the warlock who laid a curse on this land?

Id: [0x002CA42E]
So, you are not using your magic against this land and its people.

Id: [0x002CA42F]
So, you are not using your magic against this land and its people.

Id: [0x002CA439]
Help! They have taken the jarl!

Id: [0x002CA43B]
He has been taken by bandits. Come, quickly!

Id: [0x002CA43D]
If you are as brave as you appear, you will come.

Id: [0x002CA43E]
Which jarl?

Id: [0x002CA43F]
Which jarl?

And yet are we going to pray at the idol of another? Is this Saint Kenhelm your god?

Id: [0x002CA447]
And yet are we going to pray at the idol of another? Is this Saint Kenhelm your god?

Id: [0x002CA449]
No. And we do not call him such. He is simply closer to the Lord's ear.

Id: [0x002CA44F]
O Lord, gift upon this lowly servant your greatest gift. Patience.

Id: [0x002CA453]
And yet, you insist on doing so… [he looks up from prayer at Eivor's silence]What is it you are looking at? A hare?

Id: [0x002CA455]
I will not have to interrupt your prayer to protect you, Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002CA456]
I will not have to interrupt your prayer to protect you, Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002CA457]
Give me my moment's prayer, Eivor. I ask only this.

Id: [0x002CA462]
Speak to me, you stone-dwelling god-woman!

Id: [0x002CA464]
Gods burn it all!

Id: [0x002CA466]
Keep digging, mules. Power beyond measure awaits. Power beyond measure.

Id: [0x002CA47A]
Keep digging, you beardless dogs!

Id: [0x002CA47B]
Heed me, Gorm of the Order. Ancient Ones, I summon you!

Id: [0x002CA47D]
You heard the man! Move those shovels!

Id: [0x002CA47E]
Power beyond measure awaits us, men! A mountain of silver to the first digger to open the way!

Id: [0x002CA480]
Gorm, we have found nothing but a gate we cannot open.

Id: [0x002CA481]
He made a peace-pledge to avoid the fates we ended up with. Banished. I often wonder how things would have been.

Id: [0x002CA482]
I shall call upon our ally.

Id: [0x002CA487]
What does that gibberish mean?

Id: [0x002CA490]
Aw, no![groan]

Id: [0x002CA491]
The seats have spoken! Frode, write this down! Let it be known that candied pears emerge the victor this day!

Id: [0x002CA492]
We hereby decree that only candied pears shall be served at feasts! Now everyone back to your starting positions!

Id: [0x002CA495]
Hm … what about the Tall One? Can we ask her to help break this tie!

Id: [0x002CA496]
Good idea, Frode! Tall One, sit by the hay-side if you vote for the woods! For the river … the side with the sacks of beans!

Id: [0x002CA4A1]
It looks like we are tied … for now.

Id: [0x002CA4A2]
Tall One, we need your help once more!

Id: [0x002CA4A4]
Gorm, did you find Olav the Unlucky?

Id: [0x002CA4A6]
Hurry, Tall One! We don't have much time left to play!

Id: [0x002CA4A9]
Hay-side stools for beating up the enemy! Side with the sacks of beans for taking him prisoner to be questioned!

Id: [0x002CA4AC]
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

Id: [0x002CA4AD]
The Tall One does not want to play, because the Tall One is a big baby.

Id: [0x002CA4B1]
The seats have spoken! We shall show no mercy! The Badge of Courage will be given to those who voted as such! You too, Tall One!

Id: [0x002CA4B6]
What should we do if we manage to capture a Pict soldier?

Id: [0x002CA4B7]
Stools on the hay-side are for beating him up! Side with the sacks of beans for taking him prisoner! Vote!

Id: [0x002CA4BC]
The seats have spoken! We will take the prisoner for questioning!

Id: [0x002CA4BE]
The Badge of Wisdom shall be awarded to those who voted for this! You too, Tall One!

Id: [0x002CA4CC]
I call upon you, Freyr, blessed brother to Freyja! I plead with you, O Vanir! Leave a bounty where my blood-mead falls!

Id: [0x002CA4D1]
What? Spit it out.

Id: [0x002CA4D2]
It may be your talking crystal is a Dwarvish trick. As in the sagas when--

Id: [0x002CA4D3]
Silence! Speak no treason against my Order. We are all-wise, all-knowing, and all-powerful.

Id: [0x002CA4D5]
Sir, I hate to ask, but…

Id: [0x002CA4D6]
Nobody steals from me and walks away breathing.

Id: [0x002CA4D7]
Better to cut out your own tongue than speak against the crystal goddess.

Id: [0x002CA4D8]
What news from our camps?

Id: [0x002CA4D9]
In truth, they have grown quiet. Little to no word at all.

Id: [0x002CA4DF]
Hm. No matter. Focus our efforts on the dig.

Id: [0x002CA4E2]
I am, though I must rest. Then I will chant and sow the blood-mead, [beat]a task I must perform alone.

Id: [0x002CA4E4]
You've done enough, and for that, I thank you. But return in a few days and see the ripening fields.

Id: [0x002CA4E5]
I understand. What else can I do?

Id: [0x002CA4E6]
I understand. What else can I do?

Id: [0x002CA4E7]
The elk up north are abundant, so I led a bunch of men into the woods, and we found two big males, jousting.

Id: [0x002CA4F7]
I had never seen anything like it, horn on horn, bone on bone at that speed, with that power. Over and over and over again.

Id: [0x002CA4F8]
Until only a single elk stood standing. Bloodied, triumphant. Facing me, we were two giants going at it for food, land, sex.

Id: [0x002CA4F9]
My blood was pumping. I told the men to lower their bows as I approached it. I cast my spear aside, dug my boots into the snow.

Id: [0x002CA4FA]
This was my land now and I had to prove it. We ran towards each other, and crash! [beat]I woke up a camp with my screaming.

Id: [0x002CA4FC]
The men killed the elk for food and nursed me back to health. It was the first lesson England taught me. "Don't fuck with the elk".

Id: [0x002CA4FF]

One last effort! Drive them back!

One last effort! Drive them back!

Quiet.

Never!

Well, well, well! Is that Eivor I see?

I expected more people about, Magni … has something happened?

Id: [0x002CA56E]
I expected more people about, Magni … has something happened?

Id: [0x002CA56F]
Soma rounded up some warriors and took them west. She's hoping to open a new trade route with Oxeneforda.

Id: [0x002CA571]
Only now, in times of trouble, I have discovered I am not the surrogate leader I should hope to be.

Id: [0x002CA572]
What sort of trouble?

Id: [0x002CA573]
O, a pack of surly bandits have encamped nearby. To the east, at the water's edge.

Id: [0x002CA574]
They attack all merchants who travel here by river or road. And word is spreading quickly. It's keeping traders at bay.

Id: [0x002CA576]
It has crippled me already. The bastards stole my horse yestermorning.

Id: [0x002CA577]
That could cripple your town if it carries on too long.

Id: [0x002CA578]
That could cripple your town if it carries on too long.

Id: [0x002CA579]
With Soma away, I tend to the city as best I can.

Id: [0x002CA57A]
Things have been … different since Soma died.

Id: [0x002CA57C]
We can take care of them, Magni. And if we do not find your horse, we will steal you a new one.

Id: [0x002CA57E]
O, that would ease my mind. I have nothing to offer you for this deed, but the bandits surely would. Take from them what you like.

Id: [0x002CA57F]
Good. Consider the matter handled.

Id: [0x002CA580]
So what will you--

Id: [0x002CA581]
So what will you--

Id: [0x002CA591]
Seems quiet. Where is everyone?

Id: [0x002CA592]

Dandy.

Id: [0x002CA598]
Dandy.

Id: [0x002CA599]
We need a place for you to stay. Would you like to join my settlement?

Id: [0x002CA59A]
We need a place for you to stay. Would you like to join my settlement?

Id: [0x002CA5A7]
What? No, I… God's pearly tooth! Here's payment for you and we will both forget this meeting.

Id: [0x002CA5A8]
Your skin was pale as midnight mist. Hair threaded with dew. Eyes glassy, limpid, accusing. Still so beautiful, so pure.

Id: [0x002CA5AE]
(laughing)

Id: [0x002CA5B2]
Stop!

Id: [0x002CA5B6]
(scream)

Id: [0x002CA5B7]
(scream)

Id: [0x002CA5B8]
Burn in your Hell!

Id: [0x002CA5B9]
Burn in your Hell!

Id: [0x002CA5BA]
(laughing, coughing)

Id: [0x002CA5C1]
That sound? Almost human, but… Gods!

Id: [0x002CA5C2]
That sound? Almost human, but… Gods!

Id: [0x002CA5C4]
You misunderstand, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CA5C6]
I'll eat your heart!

Id: [0x002CA5C7]
I'll eat your heart!

Id: [0x002CA5CE]
The beauty of the divine!

Id: [0x002CA5D0]
(scream)

Id: [0x002CA5D4]
Yes! Illuminate me, O Lord. Illuminate me!

Id: [0x002CA5D9]
I cannot thank you enough. Both of you.

Id: [0x002CA5E6]
Not a problem, friend.

Id: [0x002CA5E7]
Not a problem, friend.

Id: [0x002CA5EE]
I am Guthban, Eivor. It means Battle-Bone. Not the name of a cheery baker, is it?

Id: [0x002CA5F1]
Tarben. Do you have second? I was wondering if--

Id: [0x002CA5F2]
Tarben. Do you have second? I was wondering if--

Id: [0x002CA5F6]
Nicely done!

Id: [0x002CA5F9]
The bandits are camped on the river, he said. East of the water's edge.

Id: [0x002CA5FD]
Eivor! Over here! Look at this.

Id: [0x002CA5FE]
O ho! Someone is thirsty!

Id: [0x002CA602]
What can I say? Not the first, and it will not be the last.

Id: [0x002CA603]
I think you may have punctured poor Magni's heart back there.

Id: [0x002CA604]
I think you may have punctured poor Magni's heart back there.

Id: [0x002CA605]
She has saved your brother!

Id: [0x002CA60B]
(scream)

Id: [0x002CA612]
A feeling you must know well, no? I have always wanted to experience the world as you do, and now I will…

Id: [0x002CA614]
Yes, indeed, my lord. I shall follow your order to the letter.

Id: [0x002CA616]
O certainly not, Eivor Wolf-Kissed, iron-fisted drengr. I would never tease one with such commanding authority.

Id: [0x002CA617]
You volunteered us for a fight, Randvi. Is that your idea of a pleasant ride through the country?

Id: [0x002CA618]
You volunteered us for a fight, Randvi. Is that your idea of a pleasant ride through the country?

Id: [0x002CA619]
We will help Magni and clear these bandits. But do not be rash when we find them. The Raven Clan needs your steady hand.

Id: [0x002CA61C]
If I did not know any better, I would say you're teasing me…

Id: [0x002CA62B]
There. The bandit camp.

Id: [0x002CA62D]
Brood and look sternly at the horizon?

Id: [0x002CA62F]
All right. Stay close. And do as I do.

Id: [0x002CA630]
All right. Stay close. And do as I do.

Id: [0x002CA631]
By all means.

Id: [0x002CA632]
By all means.

Id: [0x002CA635]
Rowan.

Id: [0x002CA636]
Rowan.

Id: [0x002CA641]
This is no place for you, priest. Go. Now.

Id: [0x002CA642]
Blasphemy! Stop this at once!

Id: [0x002CA644]
Something troubling you, Father?

Id: [0x002CA649]
Octavian.

Id: [0x002CA64A]
Octavian.

Id: [0x002CA692]
Yes! Halewyn's cabin is on a lake near where the Cearrwell and Great Ouse rivers meet. But he's a strange fish.

Id: [0x002CA693]
Rarely does he speak to mortals, preferring the company of spirits. Now, I've business at Rollendritch. Find me there later.

Id: [0x002CA697]
Then we'll turn you into a beastie, and have you roam the hills braying for sweets and drink.

Id: [0x002CA699]
Freely given? Hmph, I've only seen such a thing done at feasts.

Id: [0x002CA69A]
Freely given? Hmph, I've only seen such a thing done at feasts.

Id: [0x002CA6A2]
Mother, it's the friend of the mangled-leg man!

Id: [0x002CA6A4]
A challenger approaches!

Id: [0x002CA6A5]
O, bless!

Id: [0x002CA6B0]
You must fight for me with all your heart, for if you fail, a lifetime of gloom awaits me!

Id: [0x002CA6B7]
O, good.

Id: [0x002CA6B9]
Huh. Well now … I'd say that's worth a look.

Id: [0x002CA6BB]
Just … stand at the door below. That will place you directly between me and any bad, bad men.

Id: [0x002CA6BC]
Wait. No! Come back! You must fight for me. I am in a perpetual state of danger and must be protected!

Id: [0x002CA6BD]
Perfect, I feel safer already.

Id: [0x002CA6BE]
Yes! You've done it again! I think we are destined to do this forever.

Id: [0x002CA6BF]
Are you still there? My savior? O dear…

Id: [0x002CA6C2]
Real trouble. Keep quiet--

Id: [0x002CA6C3]
Real trouble. Keep quiet--

Id: [0x002CA6C4]
Ugh.

Id: [0x002CA6C5]
Ugh.

Id: [0x002CA6D1]
You are weak like your father was weak.

Id: [0x002CA6D2]
Your flesh will feed my wolves.

Id: [0x002CA6D6]
I will put you down as I did your father.

Id: [0x002CA6D7]
Why do you refuse to die?

Id: [0x002CA6D9]
You destroyed my life. I will take yours.

Id: [0x002CA6DA]
You destroyed my life. I will take yours.

Id: [0x002CA6DB]
My blade will drink your blood.

Id: [0x002CA6DC]
My blade will drink your blood.

Id: [0x002CA6DF]
Rise, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CA6E0]
This is not your day to die.

Id: [0x002CA6E1]
Dandelion Puff! You live! That was wrong to stay in the burning house. Wrong, wrong, wrong!

Id: [0x002CA6ED]
Bertha, please, you simply do not understand me! Just leave me be!

Id: [0x002CA6F2]
Are you here to steal Aldwyn from me? [sigh]But of course, his handsome face is a sight to behold!

Id: [0x002CA6F4]
Listen to you! If you are such a poet, help me open the door to his heart.

Id: [0x002CA6F6]
I shall try it your way, wordsmith.

Id: [0x002CA6F7]
Aldwyn, your shoulders stand tall and hulking like the King of the Hills. My lips long to be caressed by your forested beard!

Id: [0x002CA6FA]
I will wait forever, Aldwyn! Make me your ale-muse, and together we'll froth with passion, ferment with love!

Id: [0x002CA6FD]
Aren't you a wise devil? Why didn't I think of that!

Id: [0x002CA6FE]
Here comes a tale, about legendary ale, so famous and delicious, it's the greatest in sales!

Id: [0x002CA701]
You chose the wrong words.

Id: [0x002CA702]

Id: [0x002CA703]
Men are vain creatures. Sing of his strength and beauty, compare him to a powerful mountain.

Id: [0x002CA704]

Id: [0x002CA70A]
You say he's a brewer. Praise his skills at the craft.

Id: [0x002CA726]
I refuse! Aldwyn's scent, the fermented hops on his breath… He's unmatched by any other stallion at the alehouse!

Id: [0x002CA727]
You seem … an ill match for Aldwyn. You could find love elsewhere.

Id: [0x002CA728]
You seem … an ill match for Aldwyn. You could find love elsewhere.

Id: [0x002CA729]
You wield more than honeyed words, don't you? Take as a gift anything you like from my house, but please, leave my heart.

Id: [0x002CA72A]
Thank you, friend. Take these trinkets I crafted for Aldwyn! Seems I don't need them anymore.

Id: [0x002CA72C]
I could take her to the next bloodstone. She could finish the rite.

Id: [0x002CA72D]
I could take her to the next bloodstone. She could finish the rite.

Id: [0x002CA730]
This way.

Id: [0x002CA741]
We are together now, wife. You will never leave my side. Whispering in my ear like a moth's wings.

Id: [0x002CA742]
Who do you speak to? There is no one here.

Id: [0x002CA743]

Hush, my love. All will be well.

Who are you? What is this?

Id: [0x002CA77F]
Abase yourself, worms! Faith is all that stands between you and damnation!

Id: [0x002CA780]
Repent now and be forgiven, or burn in Hell for eternity! And eternity, I assure you, is a very long time!

Id: [0x002CA793]
That's right! Get in there! Mash their little bunny heads in!

Id: [0x002CA795]
Flopsy! Lord Snuffles! What have they done to you?

Id: [0x002CA796]
Just taking care of business, Ahlstan. I warned you what would happen if you let them in my turnip patch again.

Id: [0x002CA797]
My babies! They're not to blame! How could you? You've gone too far this time, wife!

Id: [0x002CA79C]
Every day my loins wither with waiting. When will he come to me?

Id: [0x002CA79E]
Do you? Or did you hear the chime of my coin purse?

Id: [0x002CA79F]
No. Not when the village children pelt my door with vegetables, call me "old maid" and "witch".

Id: [0x002CA7A0]
Leave your scorn. There is a man, we have been secretly betrothed for years. But his father refuses our union.

Id: [0x002CA7A3]
You will know my love by his red hair. And try not to kill his father. That will put a damper on our happy day.

[ONO groans and mumbling]

Ow, my head.

Wait, may I enquire? The dulcet timbre of your voice. The godlike strength of your gait. You are a warrior, yes?

Id: [0x002CA7BE]
The stars prophesied our meeting! I am the gleewoman Aswig the Mellifluous. You have heard of me? No matter.

I … er…

A lone skiff bobbing on the sea of opportunity. Wait, what is that on the horizon? Adventure!

Id: [0x002CA7C2]
Destiny has made you my muse! I shall follow you, record your great deeds with poetry.

Id: [0x002CA7C3]
Come back here and untie me! There are wolves, bears! You will be sorry when I am eaten! Who will sing of your deeds then?

Id: [0x002CA7C4]
You ungrateful peasants. If poetry be the cake of … food … then I am its baker!

Then I trust this does not have to get bloody?

Surely an innocent mistake? But I must bring him the arrow! He'll be so pleased someone's got it at last!

And snakes! I don't know how I let my brother talk me into these schemes. I think I just give in to his endless goading.

Run round and around, pick up your skirts, don't drag your robes through the dirt.

From the fertile power and energy it holds. I must see it for myself. Will you protect me on the road?

I am not sure how I can help with that.

I am not sure how I can help with that.

From a rock?

From a rock?

Id: [0x002CA805]
There is a rock, a place of great power. They say that all women who spend the night there come away pregnant.

Id: [0x002CA806]
Ah! Ah… Get away! Don't come near! O!

Id: [0x002CA80D]
Leave her? And have her think she has won? Never!

Great Ostara, bestow your blessing upon me. Give me that which I so desperately desire. A child.

Id: [0x002CA81D]
However long it takes and whatever is needed of me. I will give it.

To be honest, Griseld, the more you nag, the more I think we would all be better off if Aflanc just claimed you.

Winifred, my bestest of bears! Any day spent with you is my favorite day. So, today is my new favorite day.

Id: [0x002CA82D]
There you are, Winifred! I got you honey!

Id: [0x002CA82E]
Rise, Eivor … and awaken.

Id: [0x002CA830]
We don't think. We know. Godfrey saw Aflanc with his own eyes.

Id: [0x002CA833]
You're making it sound stupid when you say it like that.

Id: [0x002CA835]
So you are going to throw your daughter in the lake and hope the beast accepts your offering? She'll more likely drown.

Id: [0x002CA836]
So you are going to throw your daughter in the lake and hope the beast accepts your offering? She'll more likely drown.

Id: [0x002CA837]
You, stranger. Help me talk some sense into him, will you?

Id: [0x002CA838]
Because if I don't, she just runs off. [beat]Foreigners and their stupid questions.

Id: [0x002CA83B]
Father, you knew? That there was nothing there? So … this was your solution to be rid of me?

Id: [0x002CA83C]
You're as bad as your mother. Nothing is ever good enough. I'm sick of listening to it!

Id: [0x002CA83D]
This cannot be forgiven. Murder was on your mind.

Id: [0x002CA83F]
Shut up, you fool.

Id: [0x002CA840]
Said you plague him day and night. Complaining about his drinking, calling him a layabout.

Id: [0x002CA841]
You! You blew upon the threads and they severed. She is gone, dust and bones, dust and bones.

Id: [0x002CA842]
And this is not a Christian belief?

Id: [0x002CA843]
And this is not a Christian belief?

Id: [0x002CA844]
Here we are.

Id: [0x002CA845]
[Cough]Take of me my flesh and bone and bless … [ONO: coughing]bless…

Id: [0x002CA84D]
As I thought. Well, more for us!

Id: [0x002CA851]
You'll be under the table before I've even warmed up.

Id: [0x002CA852]
You'll be under the table before I've even warmed up.

I need my wits for now. Another time.

Id: [0x002CA85C]
Utgard will be buried beneath the snows of our fury!

Id: [0x002CA85D]
We will not stop till Utgard is no more!

Id: [0x002CA85E]
Your bones will be swallowed by ice!

Id: [0x002CA85F]
Shoo, fly, and bring me my love.

Id: [0x002CA861]
[ONO: crying]Bloody pagans.

Id: [0x002CA862]
Renounce your perverted ways before the Lord of Flies claims you!

Id: [0x002CA865]
Ostara shall grant your wish, through the power of a sacred ritual. Do you both seek the goddess's … succor?

Id: [0x002CA867]
And she will. All leave satisfied.

Id: [0x002CA86A]
This woman has come to take in the power of the rock of fertility.

Id: [0x002CA86B]
This woman has come to take in the power of the rock of fertility.

They must be finished now.

They must be finished now.

Id: [0x002CA894]
Your mind has been poisoned, but worry not, we have the antidote. We will set a new example to which all may aspire.

Id: [0x002CA895]
Lies? Abbess, what has happened to you? We are God's children, all! Do not renounce Him like this, please, I beg of you.

Id: [0x002CA898]
You can still repent. God will forgive you. You know He will.

Id: [0x002CA89B]
If you cannot bear to watch them burn, then you should burn with them.

Id: [0x002CA8AF]
No need, but a desire. An earnest one. I remember the good things people do for me. To warm my heart in times when…

Id: [0x002CA8B0]
…when kindnesses are few and far between. There was one more thing, though, if you had a moment.

Id: [0x002CA8B9]
I served with a gang of mercenaries. I was their weapon, roaming the wilds of England. Did whatever they asked of me.

Id: [0x002CA8BA]
And all they asked was violence. When I left, I laid this sword on the grass and made a vow.

Id: [0x002CA8CA]
This is my doing. I brought all this upon you. It is down to me to fix it.

Id: [0x002CA8D7]
Do you not hear me, Tarben? If they threaten you, they threaten me. So let us face them. Together.

Id: [0x002CA8D8]
Do you not hear me, Tarben? If they threaten you, they threaten me. So let us face them. Together.

Id: [0x002CA8F7]
Very well. Meet me outside when you're ready. I believe I know where they will be.

Id: [0x002CA8FF]
Ah! Eivor. How's the day, my friend?

Id: [0x002CA90A]
Guthban. Hmm. It's not Latin, is it?

Id: [0x002CA935]
Did you? Well done! And did you find my sweet mare?

Id: [0x002CA937]
Thank the gods she is safe. And thank you, Eivor … and your friend Randvi, wherever she is.

Id: [0x002CA939]
Magni. We solved your bandit problem.

Id: [0x002CA93A]

She is here somewhere…

Id: [0x002CA93E]
She's here somewhere…

Id: [0x002CA940]
I am determined to get you drunk. Come on! Scared I will outpace you?

Id: [0x002CA941]
Are you determined to get drunk?

Id: [0x002CA942]
Are you determined to get drunk?

Id: [0x002CA944]
A drinking contest. You versus me. Wolf-Kissed versus Table-Maiden.

Id: [0x002CA947]
Randvi, we can do better than Table-Maiden.

Id: [0x002CA948]
Randvi, we can do better than Table-Maiden.

Id: [0x002CA94B]
A shame, because we aren't leaving until you take me on.

Id: [0x002CA94D]
I should keep my head clear.

Id: [0x002CA94E]
I should keep my head clear.

Id: [0x002CA94F]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002CA950]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002CA952]
Beautiful.

Id: [0x002CA953]
All right. Let us drink.

Id: [0x002CA954]
All right. Let us drink.

Id: [0x002CA955]
Come on, what do you say?

Id: [0x002CA958]
I thought you wanted to do this in secret?

Id: [0x002CA95B]
There. That's done. Now to deliver Magni his horse.

Id: [0x002CA95F]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x002CA961]
Shhh…

Id: [0x002CA962]
Shhh…

Id: [0x002CA963]
You seemed hot for a battle, so here we go.

Id: [0x002CA964]

Id: [0x002CA967]
Done. We should get back to Magni.

Id: [0x002CA968]
Done. We should get back to Magni.

Id: [0x002CA96B]
That was a thrill, Eivor. We are champions of Grantebridge! Do you know of any other towns that need liberating?

Id: [0x002CA96D]
Or we could have a drink. To celebrate our victory.

Id: [0x002CA96F]
Eivor, our outing has hardly begun. Find us an ale house and let us make ourselves at home.

Id: [0x002CA971]
You don't think we have had enough drama for one day? We should return to the settlement.

Id: [0x002CA972]

A few maulings do not make for a devil or a dragon. It must be a man or a pack of them. The girl mentioned a name. Grendel.

Id: [0x002CA9A2]
And these men stalk the night, slaying cattle as they go?

Id: [0x002CA9A5]
I have seen the worst the hands of men can do. Deeds bloodier than this.

No blizzard has ever blown so long. This reeks of sorcery.

Id: [0x002CA9F8]
Skami! Speak to me!

Id: [0x002CA9F9]
I'll free you, I promise! I'll find the key to this lock!

Id: [0x002CAA0D]
Inside the house, asleep. Quickly, you must kill him before he wakes! He will have the key to this cage.

Id: [0x002CAA0E]
Who has caged this Jotun?

Id: [0x002CAA0F]
Who has caged this Jotun?

Id: [0x002CAA15]
An intruder! Die, Aesir!

Id: [0x002CAA17]
Does it matter?

Id: [0x002CAA18]
Does it matter?

Id: [0x002CAA19]
Scum of Asgard! Trying to cut my throat in the night!

Id: [0x002CAA1A]
You'll be my newest trophy!

Id: [0x002CAA1C]
Get out of my house!

Id: [0x002CAA1E]
Stop! Stop! Take what you want, just spare me!

Id: [0x002CAA20]
That villain? He's lucky I only caged him. How would you react if you found another man porking your wife?

Id: [0x002CAA21]
I am no thief. I am here to free the Jotun you have imprisoned.

Id: [0x002CAA22]
I am no thief. I am here to free the Jotun you have imprisoned.

Id: [0x002CAA24]
Aye. I've been waiting for her return so I can thrash her. She won't be able to walk once I'm done.

Id: [0x002CAA27]
Your wife?

Id: [0x002CAA28]
Your wife?

Id: [0x002CAA2F]
Good. And leave that wretch in his cage. I'll deal with him later.

Id: [0x002CAA30]
Your wife has deceived me. I'll leave you in peace.

Id: [0x002CAA31]
Your wife has deceived me. I'll leave you in peace.

Id: [0x002CAA34]
Then you shouldn't have let me catch my breath, fool!

Id: [0x002CAA36]
You've imprisoned her lover, and you mean to beat her when she returns. I think I'll just finish what I started.

Id: [0x002CAA37]
You have imprisoned her lover, and you mean to beat her when she returns. I think I'll just finish what I started.

Id: [0x002CAA41]
Yes, this is him. O my sweet pudding![to Eivor] Please, lay him gently down.

Id: [0x002CAA45]
You're free to go.

Id: [0x002CAA46]
You're free to go.

Id: [0x002CAA4A]
A curse on all Aesir. Begone from my sight and never speak to me more.

Id: [0x002CAA4B]
You lied to me, Jotun. You tried to have me murder your husband. Get the key yourself if you dare.

Id: [0x002CAA4C]
You lied to me, Jotun. You tried to have me murder your husband. Get the key yourself if you dare.

Id: [0x002CAA4E]

Id: [0x002CAA55]
A woman's hairbrush. Perhaps this hunter does not live alone.

The key to the cage outside.

Id: [0x002CAA5E]
He'll trouble us no more.

Id: [0x002CAA61]
He still lives. We must make haste, away to our secret tower! Maybe he will not find us there.

Id: [0x002CAA63]
Then we can claim the house that's rightfully yours and begin life again. Let me rest awhile first, though. Everything hurts.

Id: [0x002CAA67]
Thank you, Aesir. Now my husband no longer casts his shadow over this house. I can be happy.

Id: [0x002CAA6B]
A door in a wall? Is this the house she meant?

Id: [0x002CAA6C]

Drink some mead and drink some rum, for ye know not when the Lord will come.

Id: [0x002CAA8B]
So drink thy ale and drink it fast, who knows if it may be your last!

Id: [0x002CAA8E]
Urgh. Feels like Jormungandr is turning in my stomach.

Id: [0x002CAA8F]
By Odin, this new ale is strong. I think I'm going blind.

Murderer! Reaver! Death to all Danes!

I'll grant you the long peace of the grave!

A warlock. One who once called himself a man but has since befouled his hugr, his whole being, with twisted seidr magic.

Id: [0x002CAAB3]

O-ho! We'll see about this!

Before I came here, I lived another life. A brutal, bloody life.

Gunnar. I have something here you might like to see.

I am sorry, Eivor. I did not mean to doubt you. It has been a tense few weeks.

Id: [0x002CAAFF]
They were after this.

Id: [0x002CAB02]
Who were they? Why were they after you?

Id: [0x002CAB03]
Who were they? Why were they after you?

Id: [0x002CAB09]
More than satisfied. Now come, we'll ride this off and take in the air as we head home.

Id: [0x002CAB0B]
It's a sunken tower near a waterfall, close to home. We can stop for a look and then you are free of me.

Id: [0x002CAB0C]
So, are you satisfied? My head is ringing like a bell.

Gah, Randvi…

Id: [0x002CAB0F]
Gah, Randvi…

Id: [0x002CAB17]
Hm, strange. I see your lips moving so rapidly, yet all I hear is "Thank you, Randvi."

Id: [0x002CAB18]
Ah! There, you see. Should not have tried to outdrink me, Randvi! It cannot be done.

Id: [0x002CAB19]
Ah! There, you see. Should not have tried to outdrink me, Randvi! It cannot be done.

Id: [0x002CAB1E]
I know it might not show, Eivor, but I am terribly excited.

Id: [0x002CAB20]
All right. One last stop then.

Id: [0x002CAB21]
All right. One last stop then.

Id: [0x002CAB22]
O, it shows.

Id: [0x002CAB23]
O, it shows.

Id: [0x002CAB24]
Ha! I am the Mead-Queen! Slayer of Wolves and Barrels! I told you I would drink you under the table.

Id: [0x002CAB2B]
Excuse me, I have a slight pain. Do you notice anything on my head? It's an itch or a cut that simply won't go away.

Id: [0x002CAB2C]
Ah, as I suspected. It must be from my most recent battle. You should see the other man. He got the worst of it.

Id: [0x002CAB2D]
Ah. Valhalla, it is. I appreciate your candid response. Now I prepare myself for the sights and sounds of the Corpse Hall.

Id: [0x002CAB34]
By all the bacrauts (assholes) of the world, what ails my mind? Must be a hangover.

Id: [0x002CAB35]
Argh…[pain]

Id: [0x002CAB36]
My head aches…

Randvi! Don't let her win.

Id: [0x002CAB95]
A good sup, Eivor, but Randvi's done you better.

Id: [0x002CAB96]
Eivor is a beast! But you have my fealty, Randvi!

Id: [0x002CAB97]
Good one!

Id: [0x002CAB98]
Keep going!

Id: [0x002CAB99]
Which of the gods sent you, Randvi? You're perfect.

Id: [0x002CAB9A]
Careful Eivor! Falling behind.

Id: [0x002CAB9B]
Randvi! Focus!

Id: [0x002CAB9C]
I might have to, Magni. Thank you for everything.

Id: [0x002CAB9D]
No, no. Thank you. Safe travels.

Id: [0x002CABB7]
I was wondering something.

Id: [0x002CABB8]
You and Soma … was there something more to your bond? You spoke of her with a particular shine in your eyes.

Id: [0x002CABBA]
No, I mean … did something happen between you two?

Id: [0x002CABBC]
An innocent one. Innocent as a newborn babe.

Id: [0x002CABBE]
Hm. I find that … disappointing. If I were you, I might have tested the waters.

Id: [0x002CABC1]
What sort of question is that?

Id: [0x002CABC2]
What sort of question is that?

Id: [0x002CABC3]
Nothing happened between us. That is my answer.

Id: [0x002CABC4]
Nothing happened between us. That is my answer.

Id: [0x002CABC6]
I can see Modron ahead.

Id: [0x002CABC7]
I can see Modron ahead.

Id: [0x002CABC8]
Just as beautiful as Sunniva's stories tell. Can you imagine how it looked when it was first built, hundreds of winters ago?

Id: [0x002CABC9]
Sometimes when looking at a map, I imagine little people in their little armies, traversing the land.

Id: [0x002CABCF]
I have had my fill of adventure. Time for a little rest.

Id: [0x002CABD0]
I name you Randvi … Slayer of Bandits, and Breaker of Hearts.

Id: [0x002CABD1]
I name you Randvi … Slayer of Bandits, Breaker of Hearts.

Id: [0x002CABD2]
After a full day of action, finally you wish to calm down.

Id: [0x002CABD3]
After a full day of action, finally you wish to calm down.

Id: [0x002CABD6]
Hello, stranger.

Id: [0x002CABD7]
Look there, that must be the tower! Take the bridge!

Id: [0x002CABDE]
I have seen babes in arms drink a hogshead of ale faster. Drink, man, drink.

Id: [0x002CABE1]
Do you like it? My wife and I have constructed it from ancient stones.

Id: [0x002CABE2]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002CABE3]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002CABED]
Paola and I have traveled near and far. The things we've seen! And done!

Id: [0x002CABEF]
Paola and I will look from our window out over the green of England and recall the hours of our travels.

Id: [0x002CABF5]
It is beautiful.

Id: [0x002CABF6]
It is beautiful.

Id: [0x002CABF9]
You have gathered wisdom from your travels.

Id: [0x002CABFA]
You have gathered wisdom from your travels.

Id: [0x002CABFE]
I have, and it is this. It's all very well to prepare for tomorrow, but do not forget today.

Id: [0x002CAC00]
I thank you for your words, friend.

Id: [0x002CAC01]
I thank you for your words, friend.

Id: [0x002CAC09]
And now, staring at these ruins, I imagine people of old, how they lived, never knowing what would become of their monuments.

Id: [0x002CAC0A]
I want a view from the top. Shall we?

Id: [0x002CAC0E]
Lead on.

Id: [0x002CAC0F]
Lead on.

Id: [0x002CAC16]
Well, well … look at this!

Id: [0x002CAC18]
You jest, but I have raised the frames of longhouses and hammered the ribs of longships.

Id: [0x002CAC19]
My hands are calloused from hard work.

Id: [0x002CAC1A]
You climb well for one who folds maps.

Id: [0x002CAC1B]
You climb well for one who folds maps.

Id: [0x002CAC1C]
Keep up!

Id: [0x002CAC1E]
Mind where you put your fingers. These stones are old and weathered.

Id: [0x002CAC1F]
Mind where you put your fingers. These stones are old and weathered.

Id: [0x002CAC2E]
A stunning view. It reminds me of my early years in Norway. How I used to climb the hills beyond the wood.

Id: [0x002CAC30]
Thank you for today. Every bit of it has been a dream and … and I am not keen to wake.

Id: [0x002CAC32]
Yes…

Id: [0x002CAC33]
You would have made a fine wandering warrior. A jomsviking, free to come and go as she pleased.

Id: [0x002CAC34]
You would have made a fine wandering warrior. A jomsviking, free to come and go as she pleased.

Id: [0x002CACAE]
Of course, thank you. I do apologize.

Id: [0x002CACB4]
I am honored by your feelings, Randvi. But I value you as a friend. I hope that does not disappoint … it is my highest praise.

Id: [0x002CACB5]
I am honored by your feelings, Randvi. But I value you as a friend. I hope that does not disappoint … it is my highest praise.

Id: [0x002CACBE]
That is … comforting to hear. I have long felt the same way. But I banished the thought that this would ever happen.

Id: [0x002CACBF]
That is … comforting to hear. I have long felt the same way. But I banished the thought that this would ever happen.

Id: [0x002CACC2]
Randvi?

Id: [0x002CACC3]
Randvi?

Id: [0x002CACC4]
Sigurd is your brother and I … I have put you in a very difficult position. The heart does not do politics like the head.

Id: [0x002CACC5]
Though I am newly separated from Sigurd, I should not have made such a frivolous advance. Forgive me.

Id: [0x002CACC6]
Today has meant so much. We rode, we fought, we drank, we laughed. You showed me your world. Not in words but deeds.

Id: [0x002CACCC]
I am sober enough. But the truth of it is … I have felt this way for some time now. I care for you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CACCD]
It may be the mead, it may be the air. But there is no need to apologize.

Id: [0x002CACCE]
It may be the mead, it may be the air. But there is no need to apologize.

Id: [0x002CACD0]
O no, I am … I am sorry. I shouldn't have. I got away from myself.

Id: [0x002CACD6]
What was that…?

Id: [0x002CACD7]
What was that…?

Id: [0x002CACD8]
No need to apologize.

Id: [0x002CACD9]
No need to apologize.

Id: [0x002CACF0]
The demon bear! And its master!

Id: [0x002CACF1]
That's not the berserker!

Id: [0x002CACF2]
Who cares? Kill them both! Filthy bear and dirty Danes, all must die!

Id: [0x002CACF8]
It is time I head to the minster. The abbess knows more than she is letting on.

Id: [0x002CACF9]
It is time I head to the minster. The abbess knows more than she is letting on.

Id: [0x002CACFC]
What … just what do you think you're doing!

Id: [0x002CAD00]
It's done. Let's leave this blasted place.

Id: [0x002CAD04]
True, yet in this case, the Church has tasked me to explain the unexplainable. That at times introduces … unholy ideas.

Id: [0x002CAD06]
They tolerate it. Lucifer is a deceiver and God Himself works in mysterious ways.

Id: [0x002CAD0F]
Knowledge must be controlled. Only then can the message be widely understood.

Id: [0x002CAD13]
I've been close to death many times. But this … [beat]this was different.

Id: [0x002CAD14]
I've been close to death many times. But this … [beat]this was different.

Id: [0x002CAD15]
Psst! Here, I'm over here!

Id: [0x002CAD26]
A camp … overrun with bears.

Id: [0x002CAD27]
A camp … overrun with bears.

Id: [0x002CAD2D]
My wounds hurt deep. If you could carry me to safety, kinsman, I would be indebted!

Id: [0x002CAD34]
What was it? Did you see?

Id: [0x002CAD35]
What was it? Did you see?

Id: [0x002CAD38]
I'm here, here! O … I'm going to be bear-feast…

Id: [0x002CAD3B]
Odin's beard! I-I can't move, it hurts. Hurry, before they catch on to my ruse!

Id: [0x002CAD3E]
Ah! Please!

Id: [0x002CAD41]
Praise Odin that you found me! But be still, we are in the lands of the ferocious tree shakers…

Id: [0x002CAE5F]
And yet here I find you, swimming in silver from all the wares you seized.

Id: [0x002CAE60]
And yet here I find you, swimming in silver from all the wares you seized.

Id: [0x002CAE63]
Slowly, slowly now…

Id: [0x002CAE65]
He has nothing more to fear.

Id: [0x002CAE66]
He has nothing more to fear.

Id: [0x002CAE6B]
Are you The Needle, or just another of his pawns?

Id: [0x002CAE6C]
Are you The Needle, or just another of his pawns?

Id: [0x002CAE77]
A beautiful and worthy celebration, my lord.

Id: [0x002CAE78]
Thank you. May this feast set a spirited tone for East Anglia's future.

Id: [0x002CAE7A]
Someone with a firm yet steady hand. Who can thread a needle. Someone like me.

Id: [0x002CAE82]
Ah!

Id: [0x002CAE93]
Come on, we did not train all that time for nothing!

Id: [0x002CAE94]
Fly up, Arne! You can do it, pet! Come on!

Id: [0x002CAEA6]
Watch out for his … affections. Arne is the fiery sort, loves to give … kisses. Please don't kill him if he pecks you a bit.

Id: [0x002CAEA8]
It cannot fly. I will have to lead it back up.

Id: [0x002CAEA9]
It cannot fly. I will have to lead it back up.

Id: [0x002CAEAF]
By Odin, this bird is as foul as they come.

Id: [0x002CAEB0]
By Odin, this bird is as foul as they come.

Id: [0x002CAEB4]
You can fly to Helheim.

Id: [0x002CAEB5]
You can fly to Helheim.

Id: [0x002CAEBD]
Arne! Bah, Loki's arse.

Id: [0x002CAEBE]
[sigh]I suppose it was his fate. He was one of the slower ones.

Id: [0x002CAEC8]
Thank you for bringing Arne back into my arms! I would like to repay your kindness.

Id: [0x002CAECA]
I have what is left of Arne's family. Unfortunately, they didn't survive their training quite as well.

Id: [0x002CAECB]
Try it, they're quite delicious!

Id: [0x002CAECE]
I guess I will go back to my friends, the Toothbreakers. I hope they still wait for me at the port!

Id: [0x002CAED1]
Come on, Arne. Let us take flight.

Id: [0x002CAED6]
Your voice is beautiful, Arne!

Id: [0x002CAED8]
A winged companion is a boon.

Id: [0x002CAED9]
A winged companion is a boon.

Id: [0x002CAEDD]
What news do you bring?

Id: [0x002CAEDE]
All we want is to share our music with the world!

Id: [0x002CAEDF]
Devote yourselves to Godlier activities.

Id: [0x002CAEE0]
You stomp our spirits with your talk of devils.

Id: [0x002CAEE1]
God will strike you down for your malodorous melodies!

Id: [0x002CAEE7]
Move along now. We run a clean dock in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002CAEE9]
Footprints. Might be Olav's.

Id: [0x002CAEEA]
Footprints. Might be Olav's.

Id: [0x002CAEEE]
Eivor. Have you uncovered who The Vault is?

Id: [0x002CAEEF]
We need to find The Vault. Have you any idea who it is?

Id: [0x002CAEFC]
Where you have gone, there will be no tears waiting for you.

Id: [0x002CAEFD]
Where you have gone, there will be no tears waiting for you.

Id: [0x002CAF08]
The disputes coming out of the docks lately have been deafening. Head there and dig around. Something is bound to turn up.

Id: [0x002CAF09]
Two more left to hunt.

Id: [0x002CAF0A]
Two more left to hunt.

Id: [0x002CAF0F]
Well done. Who were they?

Id: [0x002CAF12]
Gods … does The Order's reach know no bounds?

Id: [0x002CAF15]
I heard what happened at the minster and the markets. The dockmaster, the abbess, both killed. Was that you?

Id: [0x002CAF19]
The council's seal.

Id: [0x002CAF1B]
Four? But there are only three targets in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002CAF1C]
I must return and prepare for the Yuletide feast, but I will do so with a bent ear and a keen eye. Be safe.

Id: [0x002CAF1E]
I have knocked two names off the list. The Firebrand and The Needle.

Id: [0x002CAF1F]
I have knocked two names off the list. The Firebrand and The Needle.

Id: [0x002CAF20]
The Firebrand was Jorvik's abbess. She sought to destroy all Christian texts in the city. Rid Jorvik of their ideals.

Id: [0x002CAF21]
The Firebrand was Jorvik's abbess. She sought to destroy all Christian texts in the city. Rid Jorvik of their ideals.

Id: [0x002CAF22]
And The Needle was Jorvik's dockmaster. He was gathering silver and minting it for The Vault.

Id: [0x002CAF23]
And The Needle was Jorvik's dockmaster. He was gathering silver and minting it for The Vault.

Id: [0x002CAF24]
None. And it is often those we least expect who carry out their ambitions.

Id: [0x002CAF25]
None. And it is often those we least expect who carry out their ambitions.

Id: [0x002CAF26]
They were two of the names in the letter. Only one remains, The Vault.

Id: [0x002CAF27]
They were two of the names in the letter. Only one remains, The Vault.

Id: [0x002CAF28]
I'm working on that. I found this on The Needle.

Id: [0x002CAF29]
I am working on that. I found this on The Needle.

Id: [0x002CAF2A]
And the abbess uttered something that perked my ear as well: "One of the four is ours."

Id: [0x002CAF2B]
And the abbess uttered something that perked my ear as well: "One of the four is ours."

Id: [0x002CAF33]
Hjorr. The four members of the council.

Id: [0x002CAF36]
Yes … yes. Come. To the archives.

Id: [0x002CAF39]
A valuable seal … and a riddle, "One of the four is ours."

Id: [0x002CAF3A]
A valuable seal … and a riddle, "One of the four is ours."

Id: [0x002CAF3B]
"One of the four" … Ricsige, Faravid, Audun, and--

Id: [0x002CAF3C]
"One of the four" … Ricsige, Faravid, Audun, and--

Id: [0x002CAF3D]
We should search their offices now. While they are occupied with the Yuletide feast.

Id: [0x002CAF3E]
We should search their offices now. While they are occupied with the Yuletide feast.

Id: [0x002CAF3F]
Wolf-Kissed. Squirrel-Slayer. So many titles.

Id: [0x002CAF40]
Music and dancing make me whole, worry not of my immortal soul.

Id: [0x002CAF41]
This cacophony, it is as if a thousand devils grind their pointy teeth!

Id: [0x002CAF42]
You do not appreciate great art!

Id: [0x002CAF43]
Ah! My ears are bleeding.

Id: [0x002CAF44]
Play on, play on!

Id: [0x002CAF53]
Count on us.

Id: [0x002CAF55]
Brave try, friend. But now we do things my way.

Id: [0x002CAF56]
Brave try, friend. But now we do things my way.

Something fell from the nest.

Something fell from the nest.

Id: [0x002CAF62]
They've been feasting for days in that hall. None for us lowly thralls, though.

Id: [0x002CAF63]
The brewery's almost dry, and still they call for more in Aegir's hall.

Id: [0x002CAF64]
Aegir's daughters haven't stopped reveling since he left.

Id: [0x002CAF65]
Come drink with us, stranger!

Id: [0x002CAF66]
A newcomer! Wet your throat with us, and be merry!

Id: [0x002CAF67]
Over here! Pay respect to the mistresses of the feast!

Id: [0x002CAF71]
Be welcome, Aesir. Our father's hall is a haven to all.

Id: [0x002CAF73]
A cauldron a mile deep. A mile of mead. I miss that cauldron.

Id: [0x002CAF76]
There is a broken tower near Utgard that was once a place of great magic. Perhaps there is still some to be found there.

Id: [0x002CAF7B]
Enough talk! Time for a drink!

Id: [0x002CAF7D]
Once, Thor dashed the great serpent Jormungandr against our shores. Many ships wrecked, many Jotnar drowned.

Id: [0x002CAF7F]
Let us tell you more of our homeland!

Id: [0x002CAF80]
You don't look well. Is our ale taking a toll on you?

Id: [0x002CAF81]
I remember there was a cauldron here once, brought by Thor from Hymir's hall.

Id: [0x002CAF82]

My thanks for your hospitality. I must go.

I want to know the unknown. Where should I look?

Skal!

Skal!

What animals will I find in the wild?

Id: [0x002CAF8A]
What animals will I find in the wild?

Id: [0x002CAF8B]
Spin me a tale of tragedy.

Id: [0x002CAF8C]
Spin me a tale of tragedy.

Id: [0x002CAF8E]
Tastes like a boar shat in my mouth. Where am I?

Id: [0x002CAF8F]
Urgh! Tastes like a boar shat in my mouth. Where am I?

Id: [0x002CAF96]
Is this sheep lost? I wonder if it belongs to someone nearby.

Id: [0x002CAF97]
Is this sheep lost? I wonder if it belongs to someone nearby.

Id: [0x002CAF98]
Fight well, Eivor. Find us at the settlement when you can.

Id: [0x002CAF9B]
Three young men came to me not long ago. Braggarts, full of drink and sin.

Id: [0x002CAF9D]
Aye. But rudely they demanded of me, "Tell us where to find Death! You are old, you must know him!"

Id: [0x002CAFA0]
I am here, old man. Tell me your tale.

Id: [0x002CAFA1]
I am here, old man. Tell me your tale.

Id: [0x002CAFA2]
That is foolish. We Norse do not seek to control death. We embrace it.

Id: [0x002CAFA3]
That is foolish. We Norse do not seek to control death. We embrace it.

Id: [0x002CAFA6]
Ah, a stranger! Come listen to my story.

Id: [0x002CAFA7]
Ignore my words at your peril.

Id: [0x002CAFA8]
Who will hear my tale of folly and greed?

Id: [0x002CAFAB]
Is this the great oak the old man spoke of?

Id: [0x002CAFAC]
Is this the great oak the old man spoke of?

Id: [0x002CAFAD]
Ignite the sky to begin anew, here at the death of the season. Until then, I await you, giving thanks in the glen.

Id: [0x002CAFAE]
It's a fine day for a game of dice.

Id: [0x002CAFB7]
Death. So this is what the old man meant. But what happened here?

Id: [0x002CAFB8]
Death. So this is what the old man meant. But what happened here?

Id: [0x002CAFC7]
Today might be your lucky day, Dane!

Id: [0x002CAFE9]
Join us. The lad will be easy pickings.

Id: [0x002CAFEA]
The gods favored your hand this time. Dare you tempt fate again?

Id: [0x002CAFEB]
[laughing]Don't feel too bad. Want to try again?

Id: [0x002CAFEF]
Another round it is then!

Id: [0x002CAFF0]
Leaving so soon? Be sure to come back if your hands are itching for a roll.

Id: [0x002CAFF7]
Swimming? I don't know … are you joking?

Id: [0x002CAFF8]
Swimming? I don't know … are you joking?

Id: [0x002CB004]
This way, we're almost there!

Id: [0x002CB005]
Which way now?

Id: [0x002CB006]
Which way now?

Id: [0x002CB008]
Not if we get there soon!

Id: [0x002CB009]
What happened? Are they still in danger?

Id: [0x002CB00A]
What happened? Are they still in danger?

Id: [0x002CB00C]
You did it! You brought Eivor!

Id: [0x002CB00F]
Good work, Knud!

Id: [0x002CB012]
What is this about?

Id: [0x002CB013]
What is this about?

Id: [0x002CB016]
Whether by land or by sea, we never shall part.

Id: [0x002CB017]
Whether by land or by sea, we never shall part.

Id: [0x002CB018]
A courageous traveler has come to my rescue! Please, Lord, guide their hand!

Id: [0x002CB019]
A fellow romantic soul. Perhaps you might be able to aid my plight.

Id: [0x002CB01A]
You are a tough one!

Id: [0x002CB01B]
Oh! Come on!

Id: [0x002CB01C]
Yes!

Id: [0x002CB01D]
Aye, this is not good for me.

Id: [0x002CB020]
A witch told me that one sting from the fuzzy little demon would steal my breath! But! My love keeps bees!

Id: [0x002CB021]
What ails you?

Id: [0x002CB022]
What ails you?

Id: [0x002CB025]
Keep your focus. Once we have all the facts, then we can worry about Hjorr.

Id: [0x002CB026]
Keep your focus. Once we have all the facts, then we can worry about Hjorr.

Id: [0x002CB028]
You're right. The Roman amphitheater. Let us go.

Id: [0x002CB029]
Right now, we need to get to the Yuletide feast. The people are in danger.

Right now, we need to get to the Yuletide feast. The people are in danger.

Id: [0x002CB02B]
What is going on here?

Id: [0x002CB02C]
Hmm ...

Id: [0x002CB02E]
Sorry, Eivor. We had to trick you. But it wasn't my idea, it was Eira's!

Id: [0x002CB030]
But we found a dog that needs your help! She's caught in a trap down there!

Id: [0x002CB031]
We thought you wouldn't come if you knew it was just a dog.

Id: [0x002CB034]
A few blows from death now, stranger!

Id: [0x002CB03D]
Traveler! You have strayed onto cursed ground. Your life is in peril.

Id: [0x002CB03F]
We are the wisps of the swamp. Leave all you have as tribute, or you will never see the sun again!

Id: [0x002CB040]
Do you seek your doom? The light on the left!

Id: [0x002CB041]
If you dare to face the spirits of the fog, follow the light on the right.

Id: [0x002CB042]
Give up your treasures and we will release you from the fog!

Id: [0x002CB043]
Who's there?

Id: [0x002CB044]
Who's there?

Id: [0x002CB045]
Not that way! Go back or be lost forever!

Id: [0x002CB04C]
No.

Id: [0x002CB04E]
Then there is still time.

Id: [0x002CB04F]
Then there is still time.

Id: [0x002CB055]
I heard you. Just … grant me one thing. Confer with me before you make your move.

Id: [0x002CB056]
If he is The Vault, I will not allow him to kill all these people.

Id: [0x002CB057]

Ljufvina…

Id: [0x002CB059]
Ljufvina…

Id: [0x002CB05E]
I think so too. It may be we would have sailed together, over the open seas. Raiding or … traveling.

Id: [0x002CB061]
Or faced each other on the field of battle. Without your marriage to Sigurd to secure peace, our clans might still be at war.

Id: [0x002CB063]
Then don't. We can stay here, as long as you like.

Id: [0x002CB064]
Then don't. We can stay here, as long as you like.

Id: [0x002CB066]
I will.

Id: [0x002CB067]
I will.

Id: [0x002CB081]
I do not have time for this wallop.

Id: [0x002CB082]
I do not have time for this wallop.

Id: [0x002CB083]
I truly wish to see this wallop. I will break it with my humble fists.

Id: [0x002CB086]
Shut your mouth. A lady you may be, but here, you are my prisoner. And you will do as I say.

Id: [0x002CB089]
Starlight, Starlight. Which of these keepers of the bees fits Gill's poems?

Id: [0x002CB08A]
Starlight, Starlight. Which of these keepers of the bees fits Gill's poems?

Id: [0x002CB090]
The sweetness of honey on the tongue, with the danger of being stung. It is like love. Always a chance of losing.

Much like the worms of a spoiled apple, they would have eaten Jorvik from the inside out if we let them.

Id: [0x002CB096]
Much like the worms of a spoiled apple, they would have eaten Jorvik from the inside out if we let them.

Id: [0x002CB097]
I'd like to name you an honorary High Reeve of Jorvik, Eivor. Would you accept?

Id: [0x002CB09D]
If you would do this kindness for Gill, then you must be a kindred spirit. Do you also enjoy the stamen AND the petal?

Id: [0x002CB09F]
I had a feeling you would understand! I've painted my love in words in this letter. Let your romantic heart guide you.

Id: [0x002CB0A0]
You cannot deliver your love letter because there are bees in the way? I could carry it for you.

Id: [0x002CB0A1]
You cannot deliver your love letter because there are bees in the way? I could carry it for you.

I enjoy much of many things.

Then, if I may, a hoard of silver is left unaccounted for in the grottos beneath these streets.

Id: [0x002CB0AA]
Then, if I may, a hoard of silver is left unaccounted for in the grottos beneath these streets.

Id: [0x002CB0AB]
That's right! Silver the dockmaster was collecting.

Id: [0x002CB0AF]
Let us play.

Id: [0x002CB0B1]
Loki must have tampered with my bones.

Id: [0x002CB0B7]
How about that!

Id: [0x002CB0B9]
Are you even trying?

Id: [0x002CB0BB]
I have almost got you now.

Id: [0x002CB0BD]
Maybe later.

Id: [0x002CB0BF]
That was close.

Id: [0x002CB0C1]
I am not done yet. Let us begin.

Id: [0x002CB0C7]
I have had enough of this.

Id: [0x002CB0C9]
Are you ready for this?

Id: [0x002CB0CB]
Luck is with you this time.

Id: [0x002CB0CD]
Well fought.

Id: [0x002CB0CF]
Ah, Orlog.

Id: [0x002CB0D3]
A second wind!

Id: [0x002CB0D7]
If I find this love of yours, I will deliver your feelings. I am sure your words will lead me to your heart's desire.

Id: [0x002CB0D8]
If I find this love of yours, I will deliver your feelings. I am sure your words will lead me to your heart's desire.

Id: [0x002CB0DB]
Thank you! O, thank you, stranger! I shall call you Sunshine, for you broke through the clouds of my loneliness.

Id: [0x002CB0E9]
She wants your name, not your trade.

Id: [0x002CB0EC]
An admirer of yours asked me to deliver a letter.

Id: [0x002CB0ED]
An admirer of yours asked me to deliver a letter.

Id: [0x002CB0EE]
You did what you had to do. If it were me, I do not know that I could have been as levelheaded.

Id: [0x002CB0F0]
Should you ever need us, we will come.

Id: [0x002CB0F3]
When I say "far" I mean to distant lands beyond your imagination. Each brick of this castle is a memory from our adventures.

Id: [0x002CB101]
You've returned. Did you forget something?

Id: [0x002CB102]
From our window we can relive our adventures. There she is, now.

Id: [0x002CB107]
A few blows from death now, stranger!

Id: [0x002CB109]
What is going on here?

Id: [0x002CB10B]
Hmm ...

Id: [0x002CB10D]
Oh! Come on!

Id: [0x002CB10F]
Yes!

Id: [0x002CB111]
Aye, this is not good for me.

Id: [0x002CB113]
You are a tough one!

Id: [0x002CB115]
[laughing]I eagerly await your return, stranger.

Id: [0x002CB117]
Aye!

Id: [0x002CB119]
You're unlike anyone I've played against! We must cross bones again. Come!

Id: [0x002CB11B]
There, there. The bones are a fickle friend. Let's go again!

Id: [0x002CB11D]
Bah! Bugger off then, Dane.

Id: [0x002CB11F]
You got me! Shall we go again?

Id: [0x002CB121]
[laughing]Come on, you're not going to leave it at that right? Let's go again!

Id: [0x002CB123]
No, no, no!

Id: [0x002CB125]
Very good.

Id: [0x002CB127]
Aye, what say you? Let's go a few rounds.

Id: [0x002CB129]
Fancy a game of Orlog?

Id: [0x002CB12A]
Care to test your skill at Orlog?

Id: [0x002CB12B]
How about a round of dice?

Id: [0x002CB12D]
Very well then! Let us start!

Id: [0x002CB12F]
Let us play.

Id: [0x002CB131]
Loki must have tampered with my bones.

Id: [0x002CB133]

Ah, Orlog.

A second wind!

Id: [0x002CB14C]
Now, tell me more of my lashes and how they are like the…

Id: [0x002CB14D]
Your lashes! Why they're beautiful, but they are a candle in the brilliance of your hands. So warm and strong in mine…

Id: [0x002CB154]
There she is!

Id: [0x002CB155]
There he is!

Id: [0x002CB158]
Cynon, please, more has happened here than you can see. Give me a right to parley my innocence.

Id: [0x002CB159]
Cynon, please, more has happened here than you can see. Give me a right to parley my innocence.

Id: [0x002CB15A]
You stay out of this!

Id: [0x002CB15D]
Get the murderer!

Id: [0x002CB161]
They were Saxons, I know that much. A pack of them! Lifted four barrels of my ale and all the coin I had on me!

Id: [0x002CB163]
That's what he said. It's not someone here, is it?

Id: [0x002CB165]
I do not begrudge us taking in orphans, Eivor. But some of these Saxons, we hardly know them. You ought to ask around.

Id: [0x002CB168]
By who? Did you get a good look at them?

Id: [0x002CB169]
By who? Did you get a good look at them?

Id: [0x002CB16A]
Not that I know of.

Id: [0x002CB16B]
Not that I know of.

Id: [0x002CB16C]
A good idea. You take care of yourself, let me see to this.

Id: [0x002CB16D]
A good idea. You take care of yourself, let me see to this.

Id: [0x002CB16E]
You came here to ask me about no one?

Id: [0x002CB173]
I doubt he will. I ran after our little encounter.[beat] Thank you, love, you have been kinder to me than my own kin.

Id: [0x002CB178]
I'm not leaving you to bleed out or be taken by wolves. If your god-lover cannot join you in birth, then I will guide your child out.

Id: [0x002CB179]
I'm not leaving you to bleed out or be taken by wolves. If your god-lover cannot join you in birth, then I will guide your child out.

Id: [0x002CB17C]
We're not far now, love. You can leave me on the steps of the temple if you want. The rest should come naturally.

Id: [0x002CB1A7]
A girl. I've no knowledge of warriors or what to name them.[beat] How about your name, then? Little Eivor.

Id: [0x002CB1B7]
You never tire of that one. Well. As a young man, I was sent to a great lord to help with his livestock.

Id: [0x002CB1B8]
Not long after, you were born. The pinkest little babe a father could hope for! We named you Rose, after the cow.

Id: [0x002CB1B9]
Rose! You've returned. Sit with me, I'll tell you a tale from my youth.

Id: [0x002CB1BB]
Such a delight to see you, Rose. Come back soon!

Id: [0x002CB1BC]
There's the time I caught your mother with the blacksmith. O, my, yes. That's quite a story.

Id: [0x002CB1BF]
That reminds me - your mother's ring! She wanted you to have it. Here.

Id: [0x002CB1C2]
Such a sweet girl. I'll bequeath it to you when the time comes.

Id: [0x002CB1C3]
I must go … Father. Take care.

Id: [0x002CB1C4]
I must go … Father. Take care.

Id: [0x002CB1D2]
More than enough for me.

Id: [0x002CB1D4]
I would like to stay here, if it is all the same to you.

Id: [0x002CB1D7]
You need feel no shame. This stays between us. And at worst, we have had a beautiful day. As friends and kindred spirits.

Id: [0x002CB1D8]
You need feel no shame. This stays between us. And at worst, we had a beautiful day. As friends and kindred spirits.

I would like that.

Id: [0x002CB1DA]
I would like that.

Id: [0x002CB1DC]
Of course, yes. I was foolish to--

Id: [0x002CB1DE]
Let this be a dream, then. A moment that never happened but in our minds. I would not wish you to see me so weak as that.

Id: [0x002CB1E0]
Randvi … I do wish that I could indulge this feeling further. But that is not possible.

Id: [0x002CB1E1]
Randvi … I do wish that I could indulge this feeling further. But that is not possible.

Deeds are more direct than words…

Id: [0x002CB1E9]
Deeds are more direct than words…

Id: [0x002CB1EA]
Many times I wished to tell you. Wished to say what was in my heart and what I desired, but duty kept me from it.

Id: [0x002CB1EC]
Say all you like.

Id: [0x002CB1ED]
Say all you like.

Id: [0x002CB1EF]
Hm. Must have returned to the settlement.

Id: [0x002CB1F0]
Hm. Must have returned to the settlement.

Id: [0x002CB1F1]
To live one's life in so small a pen. And hear stories from you and the scouts without ever venturing further.

Id: [0x002CB1F2]
Right, right. I know this land so well by its map. But to see it in person brings it to stunning life.

Id: [0x002CB226]
A quick challenge to test your skills, make sure you're still sharp.

Id: [0x002CB227]
Some dispute your fighting skills. It's time to show what you're capable of.

Id: [0x002CB228]
I hear someone's trying to upstage you! You cannot let this stand.

Id: [0x002CB229]
Let's have some fun!

Id: [0x002CB22A]
Your drengr (warlike, cool) reputation is questioned. Silence the fools!

Id: [0x002CB22B]
Seems you are capable of incredible feats. Show me!

Id: [0x002CB22C]
Are you up for a challenge?

Id: [0x002CB22D]
Some brash Thegn (warrior/ knight) claims to be the best. Time to re-educate the halfwit.

Id: [0x002CB22E]
Reda needs to see how sharp you are. Has a task in mind.

Id: [0x002CB234]
It must be. I surprised even myself.

Id: [0x002CB235]
…unless you have a more interesting day planned for us.

Id: [0x002CB236]
Away from the table for a day, and already you are lusting for blood.

Id: [0x002CB237]
Away from your table for a day, and already you are lusting for blood.

Id: [0x002CB23D]
To be honest … a little.

To be honest … a little.

Id: [0x002CB23F]
Mead-Queen, then.

Id: [0x002CB241]
After just one more stop.

Id: [0x002CB244]
I will sound it with pride.

Id: [0x002CB246]
Sunniva described this tower for me. A desolate, yet peaceful place. I am eager to see it.

Id: [0x002CB24C]
I'm going to pretend your last words were taken by the wind, Randvi.

Id: [0x002CB24D]
I'm going to pretend your last words were taken by the wind, Randvi.

Id: [0x002CB251]
We grew very close, very quickly. Is that what you mean?

Id: [0x002CB252]
We grew very close, very quickly. Is that what you mean?

Id: [0x002CB254]
You have a fertile imagination.

Take you back to Nyhofn? A tall ask for a corpse.

Id: [0x002CB57C]
Almost there.

Id: [0x002CB57D]
Almost there.

Id: [0x002CB582]
A bold offer…

Id: [0x002CB585]
Let me and my raiders take the village. Save your strength and join us for the fight to come.

Id: [0x002CB586]
Let me and my raiders take the village. Save your strength and join us for the fight to come.

Id: [0x002CB587]
They've found us, lads. No sudden moves, all right?

Id: [0x002CB589]
That's right! We're peaceful like that. Wouldn't hurt a fly, me!

Id: [0x002CB58B]
Just a few pointers! How can we improve? Be more effective ghosts, so to speak?

Id: [0x002CB58D]
Here are the mysterious wisps. So you and your fellows like to scare travelers into giving up their valuables?

Id: [0x002CB58E]

Help you?

Help you?

Id: [0x002CB595]
Brother? Brother!

Id: [0x002CB598]
He was last seen hunting near the woods to the west. He should be back by now.

Id: [0x002CB59B]
Has anyone seen a hunter? He is tall, his hair is like mine … and he uses a bow!

Id: [0x002CB608]
Brother…! You should have listened to me…

Id: [0x002CB60A]
You have always been too selfish, reckless! Even Mother said so!

Id: [0x002CB617]
Just like breathing, death is a constant. The sooner you learn and accept, the sooner you become stronger.

Id: [0x002CB618]
Just like breathing, death is a constant. The sooner you learn and accept, the sooner you become stronger.

Id: [0x002CB619]
Remember your brother and all that he is.

Id: [0x002CB61A]
Remember your brother and all that he is.

Id: [0x002CB61D]
Bring home his tales and let his legacy be grown. That is all we are … words and song.

Id: [0x002CB61E]
Bring home his tales and let his legacy be grown. That is all we are … words and song.

Id: [0x002CB620]
I will hone my bow-craft, and he will smile upon me from above. He will be proud.

Id: [0x002CB626]
His path is in front of you, child. He would want you to follow it, to do what he can no longer do.

Id: [0x002CB627]
His path is in front of you, child. He would want you to follow it, to do what he can no longer do.

Id: [0x002CB628]
Wh-where do I go now, without you to guide me? Wh-what should I do? L-lost… I am l-lost…

Id: [0x002CB62C]
H-his bow… I could teach myself how to use it… I could, couldn't I?

Id: [0x002CB62E]
Blame not the adventurer, for the pull of blood-song can tempt even the gods.

Id: [0x002CB62F]
Blame not the adventurer, for the pull of blood-song can tempt even the gods.

Id: [0x002CB632]
Wh-what are you saying…? You want me to forget my brother?

Id: [0x002CB634]
No! I don't care about your stories! Thank you for bringing my brother back, but please, go away!

Id: [0x002CB635]
Not forget, child--

Id: [0x002CB636]
Not forget, child--

Id: [0x002CB637]
Brother… 0… what would Mother say…

Id: [0x002CB63A]
We will kill every king, even yours, for they squander the nobility they've been birthed to. Owooo![war cry]

Id: [0x002CB63B]
Th-thank you, for bringing him back. Thank you.

Id: [0x002CB63C]
I'm going to be the best hunter ever, just like you, Brother. Wait and see, I will shoot that elk in the eye.

Id: [0x002CB63F]
Brother … I miss you. Why did you leave us…!

Id: [0x002CB657]
Not since it almost burned to the ground. All those charred roof timbers really let in the light.

Id: [0x002CB658]
I heard about that. The whole waterfront, up in flames.

Id: [0x002CB65A]
A hideout in the woods. Sounds interesting.

Id: [0x002CB65B]
A hideout in the woods. Sounds interesting.

Id: [0x002CB65E]
Are you going to enter the water or not?

Id: [0x002CB65F]
No! The waters are too cold! But … the quicker I am baptized, the bigger business will be.

Id: [0x002CB660]
One cannot become one of God's children without going through the proper ritual!

Id: [0x002CB661]
No! I have avoided the water for weeks, and I do not intend to freeze this Yule!

Id: [0x002CB664]
How difficult could this possibly be? You nock your arrow into the bowstring, pull it back, aim, and fire! Try again!

Id: [0x002CB665]
I hereby baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit within us all!

Id: [0x002CB668]
Good God, at last!

Id: [0x002CB671]
Ready. Aim. Fire!

Id: [0x002CB673]
Lord save us all if we ever have to rely on you lot to defend us with bows. Remember, faint aim never won fair battle. Again!

Id: [0x002CB679]
I have a delicate body! The cold will take the life out of me!

Id: [0x002CB67D]
There you go.

Id: [0x002CB67E]
There you go.

Id: [0x002CB682]
Unbelievable. Which one of you did that?

Id: [0x002CB685]
What marvelous aim. For a moment, I thought my training was getting into these thick skulls.

Id: [0x002CB689]
I did.

Id: [0x002CB68A]
I did.

Id: [0x002CB68D]
Ah!

Id: [0x002CB691]
Cold, cold! The ice waves are taking me, save… Hey, this is not so bad.

Id: [0x002CB694]
So, is this it?

Id: [0x002CB695]
It is. Go forth and walk His holy steps, new child!

Id: [0x002CB696]
If his steps go to the market, then so be it. But first … I could go for a nice swim.

Id: [0x002CB697]
On the mark! Well, friend, you can count on us to lend a hand against King Constantin and his well paid Picts.

Id: [0x002CB699]
And thank you for showing these turnips some skilled marksmanship. Visit us again. As for the rest of you, keep practicing!

Id: [0x002CB69C]
No.

Id: [0x002CB69D]
No.

Id: [0x002CB6A0]
But we are patient. Anyone keen on the teachings of our Lord is welcome. Perhaps…?

Id: [0x002CB6A2]
Perhaps it does. But what happens when all the dead wear the same face and their pleas become a senseless blare?

Id: [0x002CB6A3]
That sounds glorious. A living Valhalla.

Id: [0x002CB6A4]
That sounds glorious. A living Valhalla.

Id: [0x002CB6A8]
Are you not cold?

Id: [0x002CB6A9]
Are you not cold?

Id: [0x002CB6AC]
This water is great!

Id: [0x002CB6D1]
I must. The bishop is eager for a full accounting of the Beast of East Anglia.

Id: [0x002CB6D4]
But what story shall I write? The full truth of this thing may be hard to fathom.

Id: [0x002CB6D8]
God saves us all, Eivor. [beat]I take my leave now, but will write you once my poem is complete. Farewell.

Id: [0x002CB6DC]
Leaving already?

Id: [0x002CB6DD]
Leaving already?

Id: [0x002CB6DE]
Leave my name out of your tale. It is nothing to be remembered for.

Id: [0x002CB6DF]
Leave my name out of your tale. It is nothing to be remembered for.

Id: [0x002CB6E0]
Give them a comforting one … about heroes and monsters. For the truth, the bone-cold truth of everything, is often hard to take.

Id: [0x002CB6E1]
Give them a comforting one … about heroes and monsters. For the truth, the bone-cold truth of everything, is often hard to take.

Id: [0x002CB6E2]
Thank you, and farewell to you, too, Wulfhilda. Make it a good tale.

Id: [0x002CB6E3]
Thank you, and farewell to you, too, Wulfhilda. Make it a good tale.

Id: [0x002CB6E6]
There, a scout.

Id: [0x002CB6E7]
There, a scout.

Id: [0x002CB6E8]
Fulke's scout. Right where Basim said he would be.

Id: [0x002CB6E9]
Fulke's scout. Right where Basim said he would be.

Id: [0x002CB6EB]
But may God strike you where you stand if you rob me of my pie!

Id: [0x002CB6F3]
What happened here?

Id: [0x002CB6F4]
Ubba, Soma. You come at a black hour.

Id: [0x002CB6F5]
And too late to bloody our blades, more's the pity.

Id: [0x002CB6F6]
I hoped to take Portcestre with this one, but Fulke is forewarned now. I have no more appetite for this. I will go west.

Id: [0x002CB6FD]
Strange times. Norse and Saxons in a fragile truce. [beat]I should find Guthrum.

Id: [0x002CB6FE]
Strange times. Norse and Saxons in a fragile truce. [beat]I should find Guthrum.

Id: [0x002CB701]
Someone stole my pie, and I, a skilled sniffer, am going to weed that pie-thief out!

Id: [0x002CB70E]
We have your back, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CB70F]
No sense raising the alarm. I will take care of them quietly. Be ready to come to my aid.

Id: [0x002CB710]
No sense raising the alarm. I will take care of them quietly. Be ready to come to my aid.

Id: [0x002CB715]
A rabbit? What good is a rabbit?

Id: [0x002CB716]
A rabbit? What good is a rabbit?

Id: [0x002CB718]
A few blows from death now, stranger!

Id: [0x002CB71A]
What is going on here?

Id: [0x002CB71C]
Hmm ...

Id: [0x002CB71E]
Oh! Come on!

Id: [0x002CB720]
Yes!

Id: [0x002CB722]
Aye, this is not good for me.

Id: [0x002CB724]
You are a tough one!

Id: [0x002CB726]
Leaving just like that? I thought better of you! Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002CB728]
Prepare yourself![laughing]

Id: [0x002CB72A]
This cannot be! I challenge you to another round!

Id: [0x002CB72C]
An immense victory! [laughing]Dare you reclaim your honor? I'm willing to give you a chance.

Id: [0x002CB72E]
Aye, if you change your mind, I will be here.

Id: [0x002CB730]
The gods favored your hand today. Shall we go again?

Id: [0x002CB732]
Are you going to walk away now with your head hung in defeat? Let us play again!

Id: [0x002CB734]
No, no, no!

Id: [0x002CB736]
Very good.

Id: [0x002CB738]
Orlog! A game of skill! Or luck. [laughing]How about a game?

Id: [0x002CB73A]
Come! A little dice never caused any harm.

Id: [0x002CB73B]
I have not had a win all day. I must turn this around.

Id: [0x002CB73C]
Sit awhile and play, friend!

Id: [0x002CB73E]
Straight and to the point! May the best hand win!

Id: [0x002CB740]
A few blows from death now, stranger!

Id: [0x002CB742]
What is going on here?

Id: [0x002CB744]
Hmm ...

Id: [0x002CB746]
Oh! Come on!

Id: [0x002CB748]
Yes!

Id: [0x002CB74A]
Aye, this is not good for me.

Id: [0x002CB74C]
You are a tough one!

Id: [0x002CB74E]
May our paths cross again!

Id: [0x002CB750]
Ah, nothing as lovely as the rattling of bones, eh? Come! The board is set.

Id: [0x002CB752]
I went easy on you there. Let us go again, I dare you.

Id: [0x002CB754]
This is just the beginning! Shall we go another round, loser?

Id: [0x002CB756]
Come back again, I shall beat you one day.

Id: [0x002CB758]
But how - ? Gah! Another round?

Id: [0x002CB75A]
Ah, you win some, you lose some. Want to try again?

Id: [0x002CB75C]
No, no, no!

Id: [0x002CB75E]
Very good.

Id: [0x002CB760]
Are you any good? I'd like to find out.

Id: [0x002CB762]
Try your hand at a game of dice with me! If you dare.[laughing]

Id: [0x002CB763]
They call me the god-hand! Never lost a game, care for one?

Id: [0x002CB764]
Looking for another challenger!

Id: [0x002CB766]
Let the best player win!

Id: [0x002CB768]
Good drengr, you have an axe in your head. It is grim. I will take it out, but you will surely head off to the next realm soon.

Id: [0x002CB769]
Good drengr, you have an axe in your head. It is grim. I will take it out, but you will surely head off to the next realm soon.

Id: [0x002CB76E]
Worse than… I suppose its possible, yes. If he is headless.

Id: [0x002CB76F]
Worse than… I suppose its possible, yes. If he is headless.

Id: [0x002CB792]
Ah, yes, thank you for telling me. And your keen eye on discerning a fellow great warrior.

Id: [0x002CB793]
I feel … it is a small wound. For a warrior as great as you, nothing but a twig stuck near your brow.

Id: [0x002CB794]
I feel it is a small wound, for a warrior as great as you. Nothing but a twig stuck near your brow.

Id: [0x002CB799]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002CB7AD]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002CB7AE]
No, we do not.

Id: [0x002CB7B1]
Me? A grain farmer. Had to take up the sword a few times to protect me crops.

Id: [0x002CB7B4]
You look like a man with a past. What were you before you took up the cloth?

Id: [0x002CB7B5]
You look like a man with a past. What were you before you took up the cloth?

Id: [0x002CB7BB]
Ye know ye need to change after the third night you wake up britchless in pig shite. With no idea how you got there.

Id: [0x002CB7BC]
What brought you to God?

Id: [0x002CB7BD]
What brought you to God?

Id: [0x002CB7BE]
Eivor! We delayed them as long as we could.

Id: [0x002CB7C3]
Aye, 'tis a beauteous place. Shame they're losing their ealdorman.

Id: [0x002CB7C4]
Do you like Glowecestre?

Id: [0x002CB7C5]
Do you like Glowecestre?

Id: [0x002CB7C9]
Ha! All good friendships often start with wit-battles.

Id: [0x002CB7CA]
The way people here talk, Cynon's boots will be hard to fill, and your feet look small.

Id: [0x002CB7CB]
The way people here talk, Cynon's boots are hard to fill, and your feet look small.

Id: [0x002CB7CC]
Aye, perhaps a drink later.

Id: [0x002CB7CD]
Enjoy the festival, Gwilim.

Id: [0x002CB7CE]
Enjoy the festival, Gwilim.

Id: [0x002CB7D1]
Aye? What is it?

Id: [0x002CB7D2]
Gwilim, I had something to ask you.

Id: [0x002CB7D3]
Gwilim, I had something to ask you.

Id: [0x002CB7DE]
I am certain my might could clove his wallop.

Id: [0x002CB7DF]
I am certain my might could clove his wallop.

Id: [0x002CB7E0]
You want some wisdom? Don't become a hero like I have. I'm cursed with this wallop.

Id: [0x002CB7E4]
News has reached me of your success. You've earned the reward we spoke of. Do you need anything else?

Id: [0x002CB7E5]
And worry not, budding Sprout. Together, we will grow you into a fine warrior.

Id: [0x002CB7E6]
I get the feeling we haven't much to teach her.

Id: [0x002CB7EE]
Fulke! You can't run from me forever!

Id: [0x002CB7EF]
Fulke! You can't run from me forever!

Id: [0x002CB7F0]
While you were away, your Jomsviking helped to serve other Jarls.  Here is the tribute they earned.

Id: [0x002CB7F1]
At least I'll have the satisfaction of seeing you die!

Id: [0x002CB7F6]
You there! I know you! You're one of us, the BBB! Gave us quite the throttling. Fancy bumpin' into you out here.

Id: [0x002CB7FB]
We could have, but I was … restless. A quiet walk alone clears the head.

Id: [0x002CB7FD]
And you do snore a little. Like a wounded bear.

Id: [0x002CB7FE]
I had a wonderful time, Eivor. Thank you for your company. And your friendship.

Id: [0x002CB800]
Now. Shall we get back to it?

Id: [0x002CB801]
Randvi, why did you leave? We could have returned together.

Id: [0x002CB802]
Randvi, why did you leave? We could have returned together.

Id: [0x002CB803]
And you for yours.

Id: [0x002CB804]
And you for yours.

Id: [0x002CB805]
There is work to be done. There always is.

Id: [0x002CB807]
But do not think for a moment that I have forgotten you and our wonderful day.

Id: [0x002CB80A]
Good. Then we see eye to eye.

Id: [0x002CB80C]
Yes, indeed.

Id: [0x002CB80E]
Until our next moment alone, we should return to our great work. England will not pacify itself on our behalf.

Id: [0x002CB80F]
Randvi. You left so suddenly.

Id: [0x002CB810]
Randvi. You left so suddenly.

Id: [0x002CB811]
I see.

Id: [0x002CB812]
I see.

Id: [0x002CB813]
Nor would I wish you to.

Id: [0x002CB814]
Nor would I wish you to.

Id: [0x002CB815]
And heart to heart.

Id: [0x002CB816]
And heart to heart.

Id: [0x002CB818]
Back to work then.

Id: [0x002CB819]
No indeed.

Id: [0x002CB81A]
No indeed.

Id: [0x002CB81D]
Rose! You've grown up to be quite strong!

Id: [0x002CB81E]
That's the last of them. Come join me, Rose. It's been ages since we had a chat.

Id: [0x002CB81F]
Yes, Rose. Right there. You were always very clever, child. Put the others there, as well.

Id: [0x002CB820]
Rose, you're such a help. Let us reminisce, shall we? The tale of how I courted your mother?

Id: [0x002CB828]
There will be contracts when the mood strikes you.

Id: [0x002CB82D]
We're always looking for help, so come back anytime!

Id: [0x002CB82E]
Come back any time my friend!

Id: [0x002CB830]
I have requests that may or may not involve violence. Interested?

Id: [0x002CB831]
I have just received news of work that requires your special skill set.

Id: [0x002CB832]
My agents are not meant to undertake these tasks, but you…you are more perilous.

Id: [0x002CB833]
Finally, someone reliable to get some serious work done!

Id: [0x002CB834]
Not only does this quest pay, but you get to have fun doing it. Probably.

Id: [0x002CB835]
There are contracts for killing things, contracts for… Hm. Well, it is mostly killing.

Id: [0x002CB836]
Another day, another series of tasks that require a keen eye and a talent for violence. Interested?

Id: [0x002CB838]
On the sea? Then it must have a harbor.

Id: [0x002CB839]
On the sea? Then it must have a harbor.

Id: [0x002CB83B]
I can ride to Elmenham and muster what remains of Oswald's men there. But who else would join us?

Id: [0x002CB83C]
The Reeve (Sheriff) of Theotford, Wynnstan. He is a bitter old barnacle, but he would fight to the death for this land.

Id: [0x002CB83E]
Ride with me, Finnr. Let's pay this reeve a visit.

Id: [0x002CB83F]
Ride with me, Finnr. Let's pay this reeve a visit.

Id: [0x002CB840]
Thank you … Father. It will remind me of Mother always.

Id: [0x002CB841]
Thank you … Father. It will remind me of Mother always.

Id: [0x002CB851]
We carve idols of our gods and make wishes before them. Like our sacrifices to Odin the One-Eyed.

Id: [0x002CB852]
We carve idols of our gods and make wishes before them. Like our sacrifices to Odin the One-Eyed.

Id: [0x002CB85B]
Grandfather's wallop is like none other. All it takes is one.

Id: [0x002CB85E]
I … I do not know what to say. You should keep it to remember … mother.

Id: [0x002CB85F]
I … I do not know what to say. You should keep it to remember … mother.

Id: [0x002CB860]
Take your time getting settled. I will see you at the longhouse.

Id: [0x002CB863]
I will let you know.

Id: [0x002CB864]
I will let you know.

Id: [0x002CB86C]
The treaty! The greatest!

Id: [0x002CB86F]
Hytham!

Id: [0x002CB870]
Hytham!

Id: [0x002CB871]
You have returned. Will you come with me, now?

Id: [0x002CB879]
Why not?

Id: [0x002CB87A]
Why not?

Id: [0x002CB880]
The lord spooned off some cream to taste. Satisfied, he had his servant set the milk in the shade and declared, "More!"

Id: [0x002CB881]
The lord wandered in and caught us making merry. He fell into a dark rage and raised his axe, and me wearing nothing but a smile!

Id: [0x002CB882]
Well, the lord liked his milk, so says he, "Bring me this milk and perhaps I'll show mercy."

Id: [0x002CB88A]
Lucky me, was looking for you! I have some contracts, if you don't mind getting your hands dirty.

Id: [0x002CB88B]
Good to have someone around to handle.... morally debatable requests!

Id: [0x002CB88C]
Always glad to see you Eivor, otherwise work never gets done.

Id: [0x002CB88D]
Alright, I am open for business. There are things that require fixing and you seem the capable sort!

Id: [0x002CB88E]
Reda says you are trustworthy. I have some work here you see…

Id: [0x002CB88F]
Good you came by Eivor, there are interesting requests today.

Id: [0x002CB890]
New requests have come in while you were away Eivor!

Id: [0x002CB891]
These tasks are so easy I could them myself… if I felt like it.

Id: [0x002CB892]
A few tasks Reda needs handled came in today.

Id: [0x002CB893]
As you would expect, I have contracts that need doing. Again.

Id: [0x002CB894]
Good day to you Eivor! Here for some contracts by any chance?

Id: [0x002CB895]
Greetings to you Eivor. Looking for more profitable work, yes?

Id: [0x002CB896]
I have work here that I know will interest you! Have a look.

Id: [0x002CB897]
Eivor! One of the few adults around that really listens for a change.

Id: [0x002CB898]
I have several contracts to choose from, all worth your while.

Id: [0x002CB899]
I have contracts, and Reda's always generous.

Id: [0x002CB89A]
You would imagine we would run out of work at some point...

Id: [0x002CB89B]
This is my work but… people have the silliest requests these days.

Id: [0x002CB89C]
I sometimes think Reda makes these up each morning just to keep us all busy.

Id: [0x002CB89D]
You know how this works: fix a problem or two for us, you get a reward.

Id: [0x002CB8A2]
… and he never sat down again!

Id: [0x002CB8A8]
Others have tried these contracts before and died. Stay focused, alright?

Id: [0x002CB8A9]
The last person we sent didn't come back. Be careful.

Id: [0x002CB8AA]
Good! Now off you go. No wealth and glory for standing here.

Id: [0x002CB8AB]
"May Isis protect you." Don't ask, Reda says it whenever stuff gets real.

Id: [0x002CB8AC]
Today feels like a good day to work, enjoy yourself!

Id: [0x002CB8AD]
Good luck with that, you may need it. Or not.

Id: [0x002CB8AE]
No coin leaves this purse til the task is completed.

Id: [0x002CB8AF]
You know what to do, so get to it. The sooner the better.

Id: [0x002CB8B0]
Do you actually do all your contracts yourself?

Id: [0x002CB8B1]
I'll remember you took that contract, make sure you do as well!

Id: [0x002CB8B2]
Make sure you don't get killed, that would be embarassing.

Id: [0x002CB8B3]
The others will be so jealous that I got Eivor to help me.

Id: [0x002CB8B4]
Thank you for taking the contract. Reda will be happy to hear it.

Id: [0x002CB8B5]
Me and Reda expect good results, do not prove our trust misplaced.

Id: [0x002CB8B6]
Success means a reward. Failure means no reward. And likely death.

Id: [0x002CB8B7]
You have the information, now go and do what needs to be done.

Id: [0x002CB8B8]
You are quite a worker Eivor. As hardworking as Thor perhaps!

Id: [0x002CB8B9]
So eager. If only everyone was as motivated as you.

Id: [0x002CB8BA]
Have fun out there. Make sure you don't break a leg. Or an arm…

Id: [0x002CB8BB]
This seems slightly underwhelming for you. Just saying. Off you go.

Id: [0x002CB8BC]
I bet some opal on your success, so don't fail or I'll be bankrupt! No pressure.

Id: [0x002CB8BD]
I'd do it myself... but someone's got to stand around here and look busy.

Id: [0x002CB8BE]
The sooner you come back, the better the reward! I'm kidding… The reward will be the same.

Id: [0x002CB8BF]
Just think of the reward while you work. Keep you motivated.

Id: [0x002CB8C0]
With your skills, this shouldn't be a problem.

Id: [0x002CB8C1]
No hurry, but sooner's always better than later… Unless you're the target.

Id: [0x002CB8C2]
Counting on you, Eivor! My reputation is in your hands! So be extra good!

Id: [0x002CB8E8]
That first day, I brought the cows in from the field and there was this milkmaid, her smile like sunshine in a storm.

Id: [0x002CB8E9]
I fancied her, she fancied me. We found our way to a storeroom to make better acquaintance.[snore]

Id: [0x002CB8EA]
Your mother had a quick wit. "Why master," she said. "This boy can fetch you more milk than you'd ever have use for."

Id: [0x002CB8EB]
We threw on our smocks and ran for the cow pen. We milked the cows in a frenzy and carried back two buckets.

Id: [0x002CB8EC]
"In a thrice, master," your mother said, and we ran outside. "How will we get more?" I asked. "The cows are spent!"[snore]

Id: [0x002CB8EE]
"We'll bring him these again and call them new!" So we brought the master the same milk again.

Id: [0x002CB8EF]
Again he was pleased, again he asked for more. And again we circled around! Soon the master had ten buckets … by his count.

Id: [0x002CB8F4]
Let us make haste then. I must find Gwilim and regain my honor.

Id: [0x002CB8F5]
Let us make haste then. I must find Gwilim and regain my honor.

Id: [0x002CB8F8]
The old gods whisper in these stones. I've had my fill of their secrets. Tell me when you are ready to leave.

Id: [0x002CB8F9]
I would like to look at these sacred stones before we depart.

Id: [0x002CB8FA]
I would like to look at these sacred stones before we depart.

Id: [0x002CB92E]
I never thought this investigating business would pay so well.

Id: [0x002CB92F]
There is money in finding missing people. Off you go.

Id: [0x002CB931]
My folk were done in by such beasts, the more you kill the better!

Id: [0x002CB932]
You're a pro felling warriors... can you handle wild beasts?

Id: [0x002CB934]
Reda keeps a list of troublemakers and this one's reached the top.

Id: [0x002CB935]
There's good coin to be made taking this target down.

Id: [0x002CB936]
Think of it this way, maybe the Valkyries REALLY want this one early.

Id: [0x002CB937]
Some good people are in danger, time for you to play the hero.

Id: [0x002CB938]
We have vital resources in this village, be quick and get there.

Id: [0x002CB93A]
Reda and I know these villagers. We even like a few. Help them!

Id: [0x002CB93B]
This is a chance to show your bravery and skill at arms!

Id: [0x002CB93D]
It might be boars, rabid wolves or even bears. Sounds easy.

Id: [0x002CB93E]
We seem to have a pest problem and people are paying to get it solved.

Id: [0x002CB940]
Reda wants to see this person dead… hopefully with good reason.

Id: [0x002CB941]
If I were taller I would do it myself... good thing you're here!

Id: [0x002CB942]
We have the coin and the cause, to give this one the cut. Simple, right?

Id: [0x002CB943]
Someone went missing and we got the contract to look into it.

Id: [0x002CB944]
Investigation, possible violence and a hike! Good times.

Id: [0x002CB946]
Monsters they say! Terrible creatures! Go get rid of the beasts.

Id: [0x002CB947]
Sources say some manner of beast roams our trade routes. Handle it.

Id: [0x002CB948]
Beasts are much like bandits, they do not care for the law of the land. And they smell.

Id: [0x002CB94A]
Odds are the target is dead, but... look into it to be certain.

Id: [0x002CB94B]
One of our suppliers asked us to look for someone. See if you can track them down.

Id: [0x002CB94C]
A trusted courier has gone missing and I need answers.

Id: [0x002CB94E]
One man’s death can be another's gain.

Id: [0x002CB94F]
The target is a talent in the business of murder. I suspect you are even better.

Id: [0x002CB950]
Remember: this person needs to be dead-dead. Not dead adjacent. Fully dead.

Id: [0x002CB951]
You're used to killing, yes? This one shouldn't be a problem.

Id: [0x002CB952]
My Thousand Eyes report a village coming under attack, not far from here.

Id: [0x002CB953]
Defending this village may offer us some new opportunities.

Id: [0x002CB954]
I have some investments tied up in this village: make sure they're not wasted.

Id: [0x002CB967]
I will not stand for it! Rob me of my coin, rob me of my house … to Hell with it, rob me of my wife!

Id: [0x002CB969]
Mmm, the fragrance of melted butter [sniff]… comforting, warm.

Id: [0x002CB970]
The coy sweetness of berries [sniff]… I smell it!

Id: [0x002CB973]
We can assemble a forward camp at the ruins north of Burgh castle.

Id: [0x002CB975]
I must burn them before they turn into vengeful draugrs. There must be something around here that burns…

Id: [0x002CB97E]
The reeve (sheriff) has come to join me. Let's hope his promise holds.

Id: [0x002CB97F]

Id: [0x002CB987]
Delicious? Your pie was blander than my late father's face.

Id: [0x002CB988]
What did you put in my pie? [sniff]This smell, this … aroma. It's never produced such an effect before!

Id: [0x002CB98B]
I added some honey. It'll enhance the berries by a bit…

Id: [0x002CB995]
You, have a pie for the trouble.

Id: [0x002CB99D]
Good God … it does enhance the sweet smell. This is … remarkable. Unheard of. A miracle!

Id: [0x002CB9A1]
Thank you! Thank you. Now may they rest in peace…

Id: [0x002CB9A9]
It is no ordinary pie! My pies top any other pies, and the blasted pie thief knows it! The smell … O, the smell!

Id: [0x002CB9AA]
All for a piece of pie?

Id: [0x002CB9AB]
All for a piece of pie?

Id: [0x002CB9BB]
The guilt … it is too much to bear! I cannot live like this!

Id: [0x002CB9BD]
"O'er the waves we sail, cutting the ocean's skin … and when the dawn arrives, the time for hunt begins…"

Id: [0x002CB9C0]
They are making me wait quite a while.

Id: [0x002CB9DC]
We are just about to set off on our grand hunt for the fearsome beast. If the thirst of the hunt itches your throat, will you join us?

Id: [0x002CB9E0]
Good stranger! Thank you for your help. I heard what happened!

Id: [0x002CB9E1]
…four! No, FIVE of those brown beasts!

Id: [0x002CB9E2]
I'd rather face a thousand wolves, really.

Id: [0x002CB9E6]
[laugh]You never did like bears, did you?

Id: [0x002CB9EA]
…Arne really flew, I swear it! He just needed that little push…

Id: [0x002CB9EB]
You do know this bird is not meant to fly?

Id: [0x002CB9ED]
Hogwash! Arne is a highly trained fowl. The rules of body and nature do not bind him! He will aid us in the hunt!

Id: [0x002CB9EE]
I hope for his sake he flies fast.

Id: [0x002CBA0F]
Have you been drinking pig piss? It is clear that your Arne cannot fly or fight!

Id: [0x002CBA10]
Stop being an arse!

Id: [0x002CBA11]
By Odin! You lot have gone mad since I've been away!

Id: [0x002CBA1B]
And once we're in, we'll leave no gate closed in that castle. Rued's men cannot be allowed to dig in further.

Id: [0x002CBA1C]
And once we're in, we'll leave no gate closed in that castle. Rued's men cannot be allowed to dig in further.

Id: [0x002CBA23]
Into the unknown we go! Join us, kinsman!

Id: [0x002CBA26]
Can you hear it? It's close. I feel it.

Id: [0x002CBA29]
Tracks. There is no mistaking it, it came from the same creature that attacked us.

Id: [0x002CBA2F]
There it is! Gods, it's even more ferocious than before!

Id: [0x002CBA32]
That glorious pelt… O, what a price it would fetch!

Id: [0x002CBA38]
Best us once, not twice!

Id: [0x002CBA3E]
Cull the storming beast, and skin him from his teeth!

Id: [0x002CBA40]
Predator or prey … you are what you choose to do.

Finnr is no priest, but he did the job well enough. And as far as wedding ceremonies go, I intend this one to be my last.

Id: [0x002CBA4F]
He is. If not for you, I would have lost him. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CBA50]
What do you make of this Christian ceremony?

We found Sigurd. That is what matters.

We found Sigurd. That is what matters.

Eivor! My second favorite Norse!

Id: [0x002CBA72]
Brothir, Broder. Or is it the other way around?

Id: [0x002CBA73]
Brothir, Broder. Or is it the other way around?

Id: [0x002CBA75]
I can walk. Let me … let me walk.

Id: [0x002CBA78]
Eivor! Did you enjoy the gift I left you in Canterbury?

Id: [0x002CBA7A]
We have nothing to settle. Die on these walls if you will. It is your choice.

Id: [0x002CBA7B]
You will die today, Fulke. But your men may live if you come here, to me, and settle this alone.

Id: [0x002CBA7C]
You will die today, Fulke. But your men may live if you come here, to me, and settle this alone.

Id: [0x002CBA7F]
Then come. Claim your brother, if you can. I shall wait with him.

Id: [0x002CBA80]
If you would find us, you need only follow his screams.

Id: [0x002CBA83]
No wall is high enough to keep me from you.

Id: [0x002CBA84]
No wall is high enough to keep me from you.

Id: [0x002CBA85]
Fulke!

Fulke!

They will say that ravens blacked the sky to feast on Saxon dead!

Id: [0x002CBA89]
They will say that ravens blacked the sky to feast on Saxon dead!

Id: [0x002CBA8A]
Your warriors are eager for battle. Are you?

Id: [0x002CBA94]
You are more like your brother than I realized, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CBA95]
You can wound my flesh, but my work will live on for all time!

Id: [0x002CBA96]
To come so far, and fail now? Truly tragic.

Id: [0x002CBA97]
Do you feel it? Do you feel death coming for you?

Id: [0x002CBA99]
What are you doing still talking to me? Enough goodbyes. Go to Sigurd!

Id: [0x002CBA9B]
A great victory. Not even these walls could stand against us.

Id: [0x002CBA9D]
Ubba and I will go west, driving the Saxons before us. Aelfred will not hold the crown much longer.

Id: [0x002CBA9E]
This land will be ours in time. What now for you?

Id: [0x002CBA9F]
This land will be ours in time. What now for you?

Id: [0x002CBAA1]
I would like that.

Id: [0x002CBAA2]
I hope one day to see you both there.

Id: [0x002CBAA3]
I hope one day to see you both there.

Id: [0x002CBAA6]
O, it was nothing, you know! All in a day's work.

Id: [0x002CBAA8]
Ah. Was this not the only…?  Right, because I was hoping… Well, never mind.

Id: [0x002CBAA9]
We could not have taken this fort without your archers, Hunwald. My thanks.

Id: [0x002CBAAA]
We could not have taken this fort without your archers, Hunwald. My thanks.

Aye, isn't that what victory smells like?

Id: [0x002CBABF]
Ah, you always were soft. Get on with you!

Id: [0x002CBAC0]
Smells like blood and brains and the soiled underclothes of dead men.

This looks like an old cellar.

Id: [0x002CBAD9]
A trifle in comparison to the great service you have rendered me.

Id: [0x002CBADB]
There is that. But battle is not so thrilling and glamorous as the stories tell. I shall have to spruce it up a little.

Wayfarer! I'm dead. I'm so dead!

Id: [0x002CBB02]
Heaven won't let me in! I'm stuck being dead.

Id: [0x002CBB03]
Help me, wayfarer, or you'll see me in your dreams! I'm warning you! In your dreams, I said!

Id: [0x002CBB06]
I died a terrible death, killed by wolves or something. Nobody read the last rites!

Id: [0x002CBB09]
Twelve pieces of silver?

Id: [0x002CBB0B]
It is an embarrassing situation. Just leave your offering on the ground, please.

Id: [0x002CBB0D]
I am not fooled by trickery.

Id: [0x002CBB0E]
I am not fooled by trickery.

I will find you … and kill you.

You're stuck in this realm? I'm very sorry for you, dead man.

Id: [0x002CBB12]
You're stuck in this realm? I'm very sorry for you, dead man.

Id: [0x002CBB15]
What about it, wayfarer? Are you listening? I'm a dead man!

Id: [0x002CBB16]
I don't have all day, wayfarer. You should know, the dead do not have an abundance of patience!

Id: [0x002CBB17]
My soul won't rest until you open your purse and put some fucking silver on the ground!

Id: [0x002CBB18]
Wayfarer? Where are you going! Get back here!

Id: [0x002CBB19]
Ah! Now I can rest in peace in the land of the dead and all that. You can go, wayfarer. Go ahead. No need to stay!

Id: [0x002CBB1B]
I tried to swindle you, so what? Life is tough! It's good business being a dead man.

Id: [0x002CBB1C]
No need to get angry about this.

Id: [0x002CBB1D]
The voice of the dead! You appear much livelier than I expected.

The voice of the dead! You appear much livelier than I expected.

Id: [0x002CBB20]
Be proud, Eivor. You found Sigurd, against the odds.

Id: [0x002CBB22]
Sigurd is strong. It will take more than pain to break him.

Id: [0x002CBB24]
I found his shadow. But I must hope that the scars Fulke has inflicted on his mind will heal.

Ah, back again, hm? Ready for more?

Id: [0x002CBB3A]
You'll be back. They all come back.

Id: [0x002CBB3C]
Splendid! And now, for your opponent…

Id: [0x002CBB3F]
Let's see if you don't take a fall against the one they call The Wall, Edward of Lincoln.

Id: [0x002CBB40]
There may be shared blood in your veins against this rapid firing Dane, Bolla of Cent.

Id: [0x002CBB41]
I think it's time your head got stung, for none remain but the silver tongue. One on one, you'll fight with me, champion of the BBB.

Id: [0x002CBB45]
Ah! A keen eye and clever nose, you'll need them both to keep on your toes.

Id: [0x002CBB4A]
Stand aside and let me in, or I'll have no qualms wiping clean that grin.

Id: [0x002CBB4B]
Stand aside and let me in, or I'll have no qualms wiping clean that grin.

Naked fists and walleyed lisps.

Naked fists and walleyed lisps.

Lonely? Miserable? Nothing impresses the ladies like smashing your opponents' face in!

Id: [0x002CBB55]
Utgard's fighting pit … the place where legends are made!

Id: [0x002CBB56]
You're not a warrior till you've knocked someone's teeth down their throat!

Id: [0x002CBB60]
Who will fight beside Dugr the Bold?

Id: [0x002CBB61]
Join me, and I promise you victory!

Id: [0x002CBB62]
Follow me to the pit, and we will destroy our opponents together!

Id: [0x002CBB6A]
We pray for strength to face the one within that cave. A devil in man's form who commands the beasts themselves.

Id: [0x002CBB6B]
Why are you praying here?

Id: [0x002CBB6C]
Why are you praying here?

Id: [0x002CBB76]
And you won't regret it! For Dugr the Bold is not only a great warrior but a shapeshifter of peerless skill!

Id: [0x002CBB78]
Besides the glory of victory? Well, I have traveled far in this realm. I would be willing to share the location of some rare treasures.

Id: [0x002CBB7A]
So you've reconsidered. Ready to join forces with Dugr the Bold?

Id: [0x002CBB7D]
I heard you calling for a fighting partner.

Id: [0x002CBB7E]
I heard you calling for a fighting partner.

Id: [0x002CBB7F]
I like your confidence, at least. I'll take this challenge.

I don't like the sound of this. Another time.

Id: [0x002CBB85]
Let me out?

Id: [0x002CBB86]
I can't help noticing you haven't released me yet.

Id: [0x002CBB87]
It's quite cramped in here, and my arse-cheeks are tingling. Help?

Id: [0x002CBB8C]
You wanted fire, there you have it. Though I get the sense you two are ill fit for whatever it is you are plotting.

Id: [0x002CBB8D]
You wanted fire, there you have it. Though I get the sense you two are ill fit for whatever it is you are plotting.

Id: [0x002CBB9B]
That's right. The King of the West Saxons has agreed to negotiate. Seems we have him on the back foot.

Id: [0x002CBB9E]
Then give us counsel. Stand by Guthrum, show our strength. The king of hayseeds will soon be humbled, trust me.

Id: [0x002CBBA0]
If he can win the peace without a fight, he will do so.

Id: [0x002CBBAB]
Who is Guthrum meeting here? Is it Aelfred?

Id: [0x002CBBAC]
Who is Guthrum meeting here? Is it Aelfred?

Id: [0x002CBBB7]
BBB! BBB! I see you there, brawler! Keep those fists up, you never know!

Id: [0x002CBBB9]
Ha! That'll keep 'em away. You are beast-friend. Eawynn likes you. Bye-bye.

Id: [0x002CBBBA]
As you said, it is the animals they fear. Now they think there are two devils in the woods.

Id: [0x002CBBBB]
As you said, it is the animals they fear. Now they think there are two devils in the woods.

Ha! If my eyes don't deceive. The BBB misses you dearly, brawler! Keep our spirit alive!

Id: [0x002CBBCF]
Ah … well, by making myself seem feeble, I made them lower their guard! All in a day's work for Dugr the Bold!

Id: [0x002CBBD2]
Are you even able to transform into a real beast?

Id: [0x002CBBD3]
Are you even able to transform into a real beast?

My mother is worth ten of your men.

You backed the wrong horse. Dugr the Loud of Mouth took a loan from me to bet on himself. Hoped to win big. Didn't.

Id: [0x002CBBD9]
What is this, Jotun? Why am I caged?

Id: [0x002CBBDA]
What is this, Jotun? Why am I caged?

Id: [0x002CBBDB]
We owe Eivor a lot, my love.

Id: [0x002CBBDC]
Sons of Ragnar? I know of many, but never have I heard of Dull and Duller. What is your plan here?

Id: [0x002CBBDD]
The Sons of Ragnar … I know of many, but never have I heard of Dull and Duller. What is your plan here?

Id: [0x002CBBE2]
Free me and I will reward you! I found this note on a dead traveler. Clues to treasure and secrets. It's all yours!

Id: [0x002CBBE3]
You are a sorry excuse for a shape-changer. I should let you rot there.

Id: [0x002CBBE4]
You are a sorry excuse for a shape-changer. I should let you rot there.

Id: [0x002CBBEA]
Is it time?

Id: [0x002CBBEE]
I have seen to my brother, sent him to Valhalla with grave-goods. I am done with sorrow, Eivor. Now I am bloody angry.

Id: [0x002CBBEF]
My sword is yours when you are ready, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CBBF0]
Erke and Stowe. I released you from your debt and yet … you came.

Id: [0x002CBBF1]
Erke and Stowe. I released you from your debt and yet … you came.

Id: [0x002CBBF2]
Thank you! I'd better make myself scarce.

Id: [0x002CBBF4]
Boys is right. This streak of cat-piss is barely off his mother's tit. And the Essexe boy has hands like a milkmaid.

Id: [0x002CBBF5]
Ha, such fiendish ribaldry between you two. You laugh in the face of fear, tweak Old Man Death's beard.

Id: [0x002CBBF6]
I will do my mother and my Lord proud today, Eivor. The Lord knows I have not been the best of sons.

Id: [0x002CBBF8]
Is this what it feels to be a warrior, Eivor? Snakes writhing in your stomach's pit?

Id: [0x002CBBFB]
Good to see your spirits high. Fight well, my friends, and we will feast together in victory.

Id: [0x002CBBFC]
Good to see your spirits high. Fight well, my friends, and we will feast together in victory.

Id: [0x002CBBFD]
Do you believe the Saxon lord? Is Ubba really dead?

Id: [0x002CBBFE]
Aye, a few survivors found their way to us. The great man is gone, the last vestiges of Ragnar's legacy begin to fade.

Id: [0x002CBC00]
For all your boasts, warrior, I scratch at you like a cat.

Id: [0x002CBC01]
We could have been allies, but now you'll fall by my sword.

Id: [0x002CBC02]
Such empty fury. It does not matter if I die as long as Aelfred is safe.

Id: [0x002CBC03]
I have no fear of death, for this battle is only the beginning.

Id: [0x002CBC07]
Beaten? No, not so. By my death, my lord may live.

Id: [0x002CBC09]
That I cannot allow.

Id: [0x002CBC0B]
You are beaten, Goodwin.

I see much smoke.[shifting blame] Are there any rival Danes passing through who could have done it?

Id: [0x002CBC1C]
But you are a witch, open to wisdom from the gods. Have you seen anything?

We set up that abandoned house to practice a raid. Filled it with our most precious things to up the stakes.

Id: [0x002CBC2A]
Even master raiders such as we need to stay sharp, Brother!

Id: [0x002CBC2C]
Ha!

Id: [0x002CBC2D]
Ha!

Mari Lwyd! Come dance with me!

Where's Cynon!

Id: [0x002CBC3A]
Where's Cynon!

Id: [0x002CBC3E]
There's a village to the east, King's Bury. It was taken by Rued's men a fortnight ago. And I'll not rest until it's back in our hands.

Id: [0x002CBC3F]
Stand back, Sprout, and observe. You may learn a thing or two!

Id: [0x002CBC40]
No no! We said to hide it in the keg, remember?

Id: [0x002CBC43]
Who was to do it? Not me!

Id: [0x002CBC44]
I will take this news to our forward camp, Eivor. Follow when you can.

Id: [0x002CBC46]
I will see you there.

Id: [0x002CBC47]
I will see you there.

Id: [0x002CBC54]
How could you forget the torch! I told you, we need to set fire to the house so the raid feels real!

Id: [0x002CBC55]
I didn't forget it! You said you would bring it!

Id: [0x002CBC5C]
[ONO: Drunken laughter]He's gonna be in the wicker man.

Id: [0x002CBC5D]
Have you seen Cynon?

Id: [0x002CBC5E]
Have you seen Cynon?

Id: [0x002CBC60]
Gah! You fool! Must I do everything?

Id: [0x002CBC63]
We need fire to set the house ablaze. Think! Think!

Id: [0x002CBC73]
If love be a crime, then yes I do! For I am only guilty of such a boon! Me, Cynewulf of The Gleemen!

Id: [0x002CBC78]
It's my beloved Ostrydd! She loves me no more. Thus my quill stays dry, no poetry falling from its once proud beak.

Id: [0x002CBC7C]
Friends! Fans! Lovers! You demanded our reunion, and thus, God has gifted our merry trio with just such an assembly!

Id: [0x002CBC83]
Randvi…

I scoured the settlement in search of it.

Id: [0x002CBC9C]
You become Holger the Thief, robbing a woman of her livelihood, all in the name of your stupid stories!

Id: [0x002CBCA2]
A little … offering to help a fellow out on my journey to the land of the dead.

Shhh, she's coming!

Id: [0x002CBCE5]
Music and dice have led her astray, she and that … Cynewulf. All my financial woes stem from their greedy shenanigans.

Id: [0x002CBCEC]
(unintelligible)[Be careful, my love!]

Ah! Look at that!

Id: [0x002CBD19]
Eivor! You've returned!

Id: [0x002CBD1B]
Is … is Sigurd with you?

Id: [0x002CBD24]
Eivor, is that you?

Id: [0x002CBD27]
Is Sigurd not with you?

Id: [0x002CBD2A]
Stand up.

Id: [0x002CBD2C]
Stand. This seat is yours.

Id: [0x002CBD2E]
It suits you.

Id: [0x002CBD3A]
No … not for now, Tove.

Id: [0x002CBD3B]
No … not for now, Tove.

It is.

He stayed behind. To begin anew.

Id: [0x002CBD40]
What?

Id: [0x002CBD41]
What?

Id: [0x002CBD47]
God is good! God's love lingers. God has saved me from broken fingers!

Id: [0x002CBD48]
Steady, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CBD4C]
Eivor … Sigurd.

Id: [0x002CBD50]
Eivor's returned! Inside, at the hearth! Come!

Id: [0x002CBD52]
Your secret is no longer safe.

Id: [0x002CBD59]
You disagree with the terms of your captivity?

Id: [0x002CBD5A]

Id: [0x002CBD60]
Truth! Truth and love have been shackled by these dogs of the regime!

Id: [0x002CBD66]
Ah! They barely touched me. I could have easily beat them, one at a time.

Id: [0x002CBD67]
You look halfway to Hel. And you will not be walking so well for a while.

I'm stuck in purgatory. Have a heart, wayfarer, give a little something to help free me.

Id: [0x002CBD6C]
A head of cabbage?

Id: [0x002CBD6D]
You'll soon be dead enough.

Id: [0x002CBD6E]
You'll soon be dead enough.

Id: [0x002CBD8C]
I am fine. Only a little tired, but well enough. Shall we look at the map?

Id: [0x002CBD8E]
O, I think I have … I feel somewhat trapped. In this room, in this settlement, in this life.

Id: [0x002CBD91]
I don't know. There is much work to be done.

Id: [0x002CBD94]
That sounds lovely. And too far to consider just now. But thank you, Eivor. Maybe another time.

Id: [0x002CBD95]
Now, what was it you needed?

Id: [0x002CBD97]
Randvi, are you well? You seem distant.

Id: [0x002CBD98]
Randvi, are you well? You seem … distant.

Not until you tell me what is wrong.

With fresh poems bestowed on me by a new muse. One with the heart of a warrior and eyes of frost.

Id: [0x002CBE43]
I set my key down, only to watch it fall into the river. My name is Bron.

Id: [0x002CBE45]
You have me there, friend. I cannot be certain. It's a very old Dane horn. Help me into my house. You can judge for yourself.

Id: [0x002CBE46]
You have Ragnar's horn? How can you know it was his?

Id: [0x002CBE47]

Well done, friend!

I am curious to see this horn.

You've helped me, Dane. I will not send you before the magistrate for robbery. I trust you are grateful.

Id: [0x002CBE5C]
Thieves! You filthy Dane, get out of my house!

Id: [0x002CBE5F]
Have you any idea how important I am? I shall have you both flayed and hung from the city gates.

Id: [0x002CBE60]
Friend, it's all a simple misunderstanding.

Id: [0x002CBE62]
Bless you, Dane!

Id: [0x002CBE63]
Prepare to die, piles of horse droppings!

P-please, no! I-I can explain! Mercy!

[chuckle]No need. I am well-versed in the spouting excuses of bottom-feeders like you.

Stop that.

Stop that.

Just me against all of you? I like those odds.

That wasn't so hard, was it, Stowe?

Id: [0x002CBF31]
Even one man's death is too many.

Id: [0x002CBF3A]
I need one more ingredient to finish an elixir for you. Look around the pond there. You will find what I require.

Id: [0x002CBF41]
Death had claimed a friend of theirs, so they set out to find Death, and teach him a lesson.

Id: [0x002CBF43]
"Look no further," said I. "He is under the great oak in the forest behind me." And that is where they went.

Id: [0x002CBF4A]
We could. If you think it worth something.

Id: [0x002CBF4B]
We could. If you think it worth something.

Id: [0x002CBF4E]
In taking this, you will have access to the All-Father's wisdom. You will walk the path of Odin, and live as he lived so long ago.

Is this the lair of a man or a beast?

Id: [0x002CBF52]
Is this the lair of a man or a beast?

Id: [0x002CBFE4]
Because he had hid the truth from you?

Id: [0x002CBFE6]
Yes. Because he knew that wolves were not allowed in Asgard. He flaunted my command.

Id: [0x002CBFE7]
Yes. Because he knew that wolves were not allowed in Asgard. He flaunted my command.

Id: [0x002CC009]
An, tu, thrio. (One, two, three.)

Id: [0x002CC00D]
I will roast him a fat hen. Or a stew. Would he like that?

Id: [0x002CC010]
Now ball your fists and step right in, there's fun to be had and bones broken!

Id: [0x002CC012]
A den for those who answer the call of a slick and slippery midnight brawl!

Id: [0x002CC013]
To compete, a phrase that must be spoken, but it seems you don't yet have this token.

Id: [0x002CC014]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002CC015]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002CC017]
Worry not, young pup, and look around, if memory serves, there's a clue to be found.

Id: [0x002CC01A]
Ysane!

Id: [0x002CC01C]
This new material doesn't hold a flame to the intensity of Ysane's older work.

Id: [0x002CC01D]
I love you, Cynewulf![scream]

Id: [0x002CC020]
You'll be less pale, more black and blue, and none shall care for the likes of you.

Id: [0x002CC021]
You'll be less pale, more black and blue, and none shall care for the likes of you.

Id: [0x002CC022]
Enter, enter, take your shot. But, careful! Don't get beat to snot.

Id: [0x002CC023]
The thrust of these visions seem clear to me. As in your first reverie, a fear of betrayal hangs upon you.

Id: [0x002CC024]
I see.

Id: [0x002CC026]
Perhaps his tale is a warning. The indifference he felt is a great pity. See that you do not follow this same road.

Id: [0x002CC027]
To do so would risk a loneliness, a personal exile, worse than death.

Id: [0x002CC029]
I understand. Or … I hope I do. Thank you, Valka.

Id: [0x002CC02A]
I understand. Or … I hope I do. Thank you, Valka.

Id: [0x002CC02B]
I want this alliance to last. To mean something. I mean that.

Id: [0x002CC033]
If I find one crack-- That statue is as fragile as the rest of my collection and costs more than the hovel you call a home!

Id: [0x002CC034]
Just a clay man with his cock out, ya nutter.

Id: [0x002CC041]
Hardly worth the headache.

Id: [0x002CC042]
Ooh! Such daring! Pfa.

Id: [0x002CC044]
Is that a bottomless stomach I see?

Id: [0x002CC045]
You! You look thirsty as a flaming fish!

Id: [0x002CC058]
Now that's a prize!

Id: [0x002CC059]
Betting the whole hoard, huh?

Id: [0x002CC05B]
Didn't your mummy say it was alright?

Id: [0x002CC05C]
(sniff, sniff) Smell that fear! Palpable.

Id: [0x002CC05D]
I'll drink to that!

Id: [0x002CC05E]
Fair enough.

Id: [0x002CC060]
We drink!

Id: [0x002CC061]
Ready your cup!

Id: [0x002CC064]
I have a friend who needs that little Roman man you have. Octavian of Lunden.

Id: [0x002CC066]
I've a guess who your friend is, and no. Osbert cannot have his greasy pedestrian fingers on something so exquisite.

Id: [0x002CC069]
O, woe is me. A king's daughter who has run away from her royal house with all of its rare jewels in tow.

Id: [0x002CC06A]
Trouble coming.

Id: [0x002CC06B]
Trouble coming.

Id: [0x002CC06E]
O-ho, that is delicious. Yes, Osbert. A name fit for a poor failure. It'll cost a cow's weight in silver to get it in his hands.

Id: [0x002CC06F]
Osbert?

Id: [0x002CC070]
Osbert?

Id: [0x002CC078]
Fan of Rome, I see? I am too. Unique methods of torture. Crucifixion, Bronze Bull. But, where I'm from, we have The Eivor.

Id: [0x002CC07C]
Uh, free of charge. Let me just grab it for you.

Id: [0x002CC080]
I'm not leaving Lunden without that sculpture.

Id: [0x002CC081]
I'm not leaving Lunden without that sculpture.

Id: [0x002CC082]
Then you'll just have to return with more coin, Dane.

Id: [0x002CC086]
I'll give you the filthy silver.

Id: [0x002CC087]
I'll give you the filthy silver.

Id: [0x002CC088]
O-o, that is … thank you. Well. I should hope so! You may take the legionnaire.

Id: [0x002CC08B]
Ooh. How exciting.

Id: [0x002CC08C]
Purse a bit light? No matter...

Id: [0x002CC08E]
Shall we lock horns?

Id: [0x002CC08F]
Ah! A thirsty foe?

Id: [0x002CC0A2]
The hoard it is!

Id: [0x002CC0A3]
All in, skal!

Id: [0x002CC0A5]
Is it the silver or the courage you're lacking?

Id: [0x002CC0A6]
Fear got you then? Deep in your belly?

Id: [0x002CC0A7]
You're on.

Id: [0x002CC0A8]
Lets do this!

Id: [0x002CC0AA]
Ha! We drink!

Id: [0x002CC0AB]
Man your horn!

Id: [0x002CC0AD]
You sound like my father. What do you need? If you try to chop me to bits, I'll scream.

Id: [0x002CC0B1]
If you pay up front then, deal. But, we need a signal. For if he's coming, and for when you're all clear.

Id: [0x002CC0B2]
I have an odd job, and can pay you coin. I can pay you even more coin to not ask questions.

Id: [0x002CC0B3]
I have an odd job, and can pay you coin. I can pay you even more coin to not ask questions.

Id: [0x002CC0B5]
I just need you to keep a man busy while I take back something he stole from me.

Id: [0x002CC0BB]
I'll make this noise, caw-caw, if he's coming your way. And you make it when you've got the thing.

Id: [0x002CC0BF]
This noise? Ca-caw!

Id: [0x002CC0C0]
This noise? Ca-caw!

Id: [0x002CC0C1]
Close enough.

Id: [0x002CC0C2]
He bragged about that object all over the village. Keep it, friend. You deserve it.

Id: [0x002CC0C4]
We talk from time to time. Why?

Id: [0x002CC0C5]
Basim. Have you spoken with Sigurd lately?

Id: [0x002CC0C6]
Basim. Have you spoken with Sigurd lately?

Id: [0x002CC0C7]
Thank you for treating Hytham with respect and kindness, Eivor. He has found a family among your clan.

Id: [0x002CC0C8]
Greetings.

Id: [0x002CC0CA]
Basim.

Id: [0x002CC0CB]
Basim.

Id: [0x002CC0CC]
Ah, a Dane! I have an object inside that you'd be interested in - the legendary horn of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002CC0CD]
Worry not for me! You must stop--

Id: [0x002CC0CE]
Silence, fool!

Id: [0x002CC0D0]
Greetings, lord. I 'eard you buy things the giants left behind.

Id: [0x002CC0D1]
Ja. Well, my father, he found a great deal of these things by our house. Coins and heads 'n' stuff.

Id: [0x002CC0D4]
He's found actual busts? What level of damage? Have you found any emperors? Which ones?

Id: [0x002CC0D5]
Romans, yes, but go on.

Id: [0x002CC0D9]
This must be the key to the door.

Id: [0x002CC0DA]
This must be the key to the door.

Id: [0x002CC0DB]
There's a lady with a wreath around her head.

Id: [0x002CC0DC]
There's one with a chin like a brick.

Id: [0x002CC0DD]
There's one with a curly hair and a big nose.

Id: [0x002CC0DF]
I toil in the fields. That barley is my hard work!

Id: [0x002CC0E0]
I built the silo and manage our trade deals. All the barley would rot if you still were in charge!

Id: [0x002CC0E1]
O, don't spew hog shit! We both know it's because you're jealous! You use that silo to horde the profits!

Id: [0x002CC0E2]
Don't make me laugh! Jealous of what? You and your peasant friends? I take my fair share, you take yours, enough!

Id: [0x002CC0E9]
Yes, and you get your share of silver when I sell it.

Id: [0x002CC0EA]
But you keep most of it! Of the thousand you made last month, I got a measly two hundred!

Id: [0x002CC0F1]
This Dane speaks nonsense!

Id: [0x002CC0F2]
No, no, I appreciate a stranger understanding injustice. More silver should line my pockets for my hard work!

Id: [0x002CC0F5]
The silver should be shared equally.

Id: [0x002CC0F6]
The silver should be shared equally.

Run! Caw-caw! Caw-caw-caw!

Id: [0x002CC0FE]
Enough babbling, someone is in my home!

Id: [0x002CC101]
Hang on. I must inspect.

Id: [0x002CC103]
What was that noise?

Id: [0x002CC105]
Bah! Such a sad laborer. Without my wits, we'd be batting vultures away. Across Mercia, people know us because of me.

Id: [0x002CC106]
It is true that we were once all so happy. Perhaps we can now start over. From scratch.

Id: [0x002CC10A]
This should rid them of what ails them. There is no other way.

Id: [0x002CC10B]
This should rid them of what ails them. There is no other way.

Heh, I'll have to take this back to Osbert.

Id: [0x002CC121]
Argh… Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

Id: [0x002CC122]
Argh… Ca-caw! Caw!

Id: [0x002CC128]
He appears to me … more thoughtful. Introspective.

Id: [0x002CC12A]
We live in a strange time, Eivor. Among stranger people.

Id: [0x002CC12B]
Sigurd may be among the blessed. But who can say for certain?

Id: [0x002CC12D]
Have you noticed any change in him? Any loss of … of happiness? Or feeling?

Id: [0x002CC12E]
Have you noticed any change in him? Any loss of … of happiness? Or feeling?

Id: [0x002CC12F]
Thoughtful? That seems an understatement. He speaks as if he hears the voices of the gods whispering in his ear.

Id: [0x002CC130]

Here with me are some of Jorvik's most revered lords. Men and women who have kept Jorvik trudging through these harsh times.

Id: [0x002CC171]
Join me now in celebrating their successes, and yours. To everything you deserve and more.

Id: [0x002CC172]
Something's off, Eivor. Hrothgar's men are rowdy sorts, but the air is far too still.

Id: [0x002CC173]
Their leader, Hrothgar. I do not see him among the dead.

Id: [0x002CC178]
Hrothgar sometimes slept in the loft. Have you looked up there?

Id: [0x002CC17C]
Mother! It hurts!

But that little girl said the creature was a giant, calling itself Grendel.

Id: [0x002CC1B3]
The crown of Wessex.

Id: [0x002CC1B4]
Wessex has a king. And that king has the backing of the Almighty. Yours is a fever-dream, Dane.

Id: [0x002CC1B8]
We need not ask for it, Goodwin. We will take it. As we have taken all the kingdoms of England.

Are we done with this pissing contest?

Id: [0x002CC1C5]
Are we done with this pissing contest?

Id: [0x002CC1C8]
A fair trade. We already have your cock.

Id: [0x002CC1CB]
And if you doubt my conviction, know that the Afon river near Uffentune runs red with the blood of your countrymen.

Id: [0x002CC1CC]
Their commander … what did his men cry as he fell? Ulla? Ubba? [beat]Yes, that was it.

Id: [0x002CC1D2]
Ubba dead! It cannot be! Gods, I will tear that Saxon's skin from his bones if this is true!

Id: [0x002CC1D3]
But not before we rally our people and burn this village to the ground.

Now, tell me what you know of that breaker of rings. Weak and wretched troll.

Aelfred is a wily fox. He appears frail but draws upon an inner strength. He will not be easy to oust.

Id: [0x002CC1E9]
It will not be enough. You must find a weakness.

Id: [0x002CC1EA]
It will not be enough. You must find a weakness.

Id: [0x002CC1EB]
What in God's name? You brute!

Id: [0x002CC20A]
Remember, you have taken my silver. In return, I expect your honor. I will await news of your retreat in Cippanhamm.

Id: [0x002CC20C]
I have called upon my allies to join us in this fight. But I must know where to send them. Is Cippenhamm our final prize?

I have called upon my allies to join us in this fight. But I must know where to send them. Is Cippenhamm our final prize?

Id: [0x002CC20E]
Aelfred spoke of Cippenhamm, a squat hovel of sheep and peasants.

Id: [0x002CC210]
So, why does he go there and not to Wincestre? Your scouts must know, they are the best in England.

Id: [0x002CC211]
So, why does he go there and not to Wincestre? Your scouts must know, they are the best in England.

It is. But uh I will need my men for the coming fight as well. The hostages Aelfred took. If there is a chance to save them…

Id: [0x002CC218]
We will not lose more friends today. Where are they held?

Id: [0x002CC219]
We will not lose more friends today. Where are they held?

Id: [0x002CC21C]
Gather on the river passing Cippenhamm. The rest of you, set up camp there.

You judged me fairly, Guthrum, harsh though your words were. But I do not make the same mistake twice.

And so to our final battle. [beat]We will wait for you at the camp.

Id: [0x002CC22A]
I do not doubt it. I have seen those strong Saxon hens, clucking round the hearth as you farmers play with your cocks.

Id: [0x002CC22B]
Ha! And she'd welcome you in Colcestre, Vili. Better than those sour-lipped thegns who haunt our hall.

I come only for Aelfred.

Two fight with two, that is the rule. But have no fear! You'll have little to do but watch as Dugr the Bold destroys his foes!

Id: [0x002CC23A]
I never thought it possible, Eivor. That you would rally Saxons and Norse under your black-feathered banner.

Id: [0x002CC23B]
They see the tyranny of this elf-king. He would crush them all under heel, and plug their hearts with his god.

Id: [0x002CC23C]
A few nights from now. But their revelry has already begun. We should attack now.

Id: [0x002CC23D]
That is unwise. Soldiers pace the paths of the village.

Id: [0x002CC23E]
They came … from all over England.

Id: [0x002CC245]
Proud fools! They are afraid I will show them up with my fighting prowess. You're not afraid, are you?

You seem to be having trouble finding someone to join you.

Id: [0x002CC248]
Calling his allies to his side. All those who wish to see Wessex under one God.

Id: [0x002CC24A]
Come, Raven-Feeder, do your worst.

Id: [0x002CC24C]
At least I wouldn't leave them to die as I scurried through the cornhusks like a rat.

Id: [0x002CC25B]
Kill me then. It makes no odds. For here you stand. Bloody and breathless, no closer to my king, no closer to his throne.

Id: [0x002CC25E]
Aelfred used you, fool. He threw you in my path. For what? He only delays what is inevitable.

O Lord, into your hands I commit my spirit.

No, I will use you, as you used me. A few hours in the company of my men and you will lead us to your sparrow-king.

Leave Hytham. His gods watch him.

Get those ladders up, you soft pricks!

The battle is won, whoresons! Now, collect your plunder!

It appears to be a … a battle scar.

Were these timbers carried by the Nephilim? Barriers against invasions from afar? Please Lord, let this truth shineth upon me as bright as your Word doth.

Id: [0x002CC299]
Fearsome, yes! Too fierce for you. But you can stand behind me. I'll deal with them single-handed.

Id: [0x002CC29A]
I had expected fearsome opposition in the Jotnar fighting pits.

Id: [0x002CC29B]

You won't get a fight without me! I'm the only game in town!

Id: [0x002CC29F]
Again I find traces of the Nephilim. By edict of the local king, I shall prayeth to Him, that this light may be known as holy.

Id: [0x002CC2A0]
These luminous placards are the divining rods of Him who speaks to me. With effort, I seek the union of all His holy creations.

Id: [0x002CC2A1]
Aita, Juno, Minerva, names that enter my head. Are these the Nephilim He reveals to me? Are these stones their signposts? I pray for your guidance, Lord. Amen.

Pick an animal. Any animal! I will take on that form in the combat to come.

Id: [0x002CC2A8]
Cunning and savage! I like it. Let's go!

Id: [0x002CC2A9]
I am no friend to wolves, but it would be good to have one on my side for once.

Id: [0x002CC2AA]

Ah, you favor speed and agility over strength? A good choice. Now for combat!

I have always found the lynx a swift opponent.

Soon the feast will begin, and these people will be given everything they deserve.

Id: [0x002CC2BA]
I am proud the Lord speaks so cleanly through my soul here in Wreocensaete. He talks of his instruments, and asks that I be one.

Id: [0x002CC2BB]
I have explained what He left for us here to the Wreckin-dwellers nearby. Blessed be all those who tread in this holy light.

Id: [0x002CC2BC]
It appears the Nephilim were at battle here long ago. Against a great tempest, some few protected us. We must honor these ancient paths.

Id: [0x002CC2BD]
But when it arrives, do help yourself.

Id: [0x002CC2BE]
Ninety-nine graves I dug in the hard earth for those you killed.

Your thirst for vengeance led you here. Rest now.

The Kingdom of Bernicia and Elmet have granted me the right to worship here, by edict of Eoppa of Bernicia.

Id: [0x002CC2C4]
But what were they guarding against? Did you command them, Lord? Was it for the sin of people of other times? Was it to keep the demons out?

Id: [0x002CC2C7]
They hath left his presence here on earth for us to absorb His light. The light of angels that hath been infused throughout the earth.

Id: [0x002CC2C8]
I feel His power. He calls me My Beloved and I am calmed. I respondeth with my communion, my piety, and become another of His voices.

Id: [0x002CC2C9]
I shall inform the local Wuffingas that He lives among them, through traces of the Nephilim, the giant warriors who fought for God in their ancient time.

Id: [0x002CC2CD]
I was a man of peace, but you taught me a killer's ways!

Id: [0x002CC2CE]
The abbey at Chertsey was a holy place! You defiled it!

Id: [0x002CC2CF]
All Danes must die!

Id: [0x002CC2D0]
You butchered my brothers!

Id: [0x002CC2D7]

Another Dane with blood on their hands. God will punish you, heathen.

Id: [0x002CC2DE]
Do you remember Chertsey Abbey? The deadly sin committed there?

Id: [0x002CC2E0]
For my brothers!

Id: [0x002CC2E1]
I am pleased to say that today, on the day we honor Yule, we honor as well the nobles to whom we are all so indebted.

Id: [0x002CC2E8]
Shit.

Id: [0x002CC2E9]
Shit.

Id: [0x002CC2EC]
And now, deafened and blinded by your lust for indulgence, your foolish pride, I will tell you just what nobility is. A death sentence!

Id: [0x002CC2ED]
A new world of order is upon us! A pity none of you will live to see it.

Id: [0x002CC2F1]
Get the councilmen to safety. I will handle Audun. Go!

I did not see you jump. Something holding you back?

Here lieth still more remnants of the Nephilim. I have marked a symbol upon the stones, that future folk may imbue their spirit with the energy within.

Id: [0x002CC3FA]
For those who wish to seek communion with the Lord here, be wary. For He speaks through ciphers, and his words are woven with ancient fibers.

Id: [0x002CC3FB]
He is manifest here. He hath made importance of these pillars, brought by the giants of yore, now guarding us, as only He knows. Amen.

I spoke with Him again. He said that he pined and I feel torn in two: my loyalty to Him tears me one direction, and the Nephilim point elsewhere.

Id: [0x002CC420]
Why hath these voices spoken to me? The gospels sing within me and yet I sense conflict. I sense disagreement among the angels. It saddens me greatly.

Id: [0x002CC421]
I will one day weigh my soul, attempt penance, attempt to repent for the missteps in my life. Yet here all shineth brightest for He let me see.

Id: [0x002CC422]
Here, I believe, is where the Nephilim placed sacred stones to guard the chattel of God from other giants.

Id: [0x002CC423]
Those present were scared by demons, and God defended the pious, sending the giants away. Only these holy reverberations remain.

Id: [0x002CC424]
The work of good souls who have the earth in their heart will forever be tied to our ancestors and our Lord via this gateway.

Styrbjorn Jarl! Our men were killed as we patrolled nearby. And the word is … Eivor swung the axe.

Id: [0x002CC55C]
If the dead could speak, what would they say of their deaths, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002CC55E]
As the dead cannot defend themselves, a weregeld is wanted. Fifty weight of silver for each life. By law.

Fifty weight!

Put that gear to good use out there!

Id: [0x002CC899]
May they sing of your deeds... and my craftsmanship! Ha!

Id: [0x002CC89A]
Be well, my friend!

Id: [0x002CC89B]
There. Better than before.

Id: [0x002CC89C]
Worthy of the gods!

Id: [0x002CC89D]
Ah. Look at how powerful it is now.

Id: [0x002CC89E]
I feel like a proud father. Look how strong you are!

Id: [0x002CC89F]
This will serve you well.

Id: [0x002CC8A0]
Thank you for trusting these hands with your gear.

Id: [0x002CC8A1]
There, Eivor, now you can take on anything!

Id: [0x002CC8A2]
Ah, let me look at you. Wonderful.

Id: [0x002CC8A3]
I'm sad to send this one away but it will make me proud.

Id: [0x002CC8A4]
This will serve you well, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CC8A5]
Good but I could make it better.

Id: [0x002CC8A6]
It could be doing more damage.

Id: [0x002CC8A7]
Give that here and I'll make it sing.

Id: [0x002CC8A8]
I'll make something glorious out of this.

Id: [0x002CC8A9]
Fine work...but could be finer.

Id: [0x002CC8AA]
There's room for improvement.

Id: [0x002CC8AB]
Give me that and I'll make it better.

Id: [0x002CC8AC]
Good, but not yet perfect.

Id: [0x002CC8AD]
Hand that over and watch me work my magic.

Id: [0x002CC8AE]
Again? Will you ever be satisfied?

Id: [0x002CC8AF]
Ah! Now this is impressive!

Id: [0x002CC8B0]
My finest work!

Id: [0x002CC8B1]
I have outdone myself!

Id: [0x002CC8B2]
Gunnar, you've created a masterpiece!

Id: [0x002CC8B3]
Give it a good home!

Id: [0x002CC8B4]
There. It's yours now.

Id: [0x002CC8B5]
You've made a very wise choice!

Id: [0x002CC8B6]
A fine choice!

Id: [0x002CC8B7]
It will serve you well!

Id: [0x002CC8B8]
You like the looks of that one?

Id: [0x002CC8B9]
Ah, that one's pretty good.

Id: [0x002CC8BA]
I can get you that one, easy.

Id: [0x002CC8BB]
You have a keen eye for quality!

Id: [0x002CC8BC]
All my pieces are good but that one's very good.

Id: [0x002CC8BD]
I know it will be in worthy hands with you.

Id: [0x002CC8BE]
Is that what you want?

Id: [0x002CC8BF]
I've never seen anything like this. It is of the gods.

Id: [0x002CC8C0]
I don't know where you found this, Eivor, but... I'm impressed.

Id: [0x002CC8C1]
This! This... is a legendary blade. It shines like the sun.

Id: [0x002CC8CD]
You have seen nothing of our strength.

Id: [0x002CC8CE]
You have seen nothing of our strength.

Id: [0x002CC8D9]
By all that is holy and bright.

Id: [0x002CC8DC]
What manner of monster is that thing?

Id: [0x002CC8DE]
Not a monster, but a man. Strange to behold, but this Grendel is … was … a man.

Id: [0x002CC8DF]
Not a monster, but a man. Strange to behold, but this Grendel is … was … a man.

Id: [0x002CC8E1]
But where did it come from?

Id: [0x002CC8E6]
You left me no choice. I entered the Althing (clan gathering) a prince. I left the son of a jarl.

Id: [0x002CC8E8]
And you have plundered Fornburg's resources, I see. You leave nothing behind but your honor.

Id: [0x002CC990]
All men have mothers. This one called out for his, in the end.

Id: [0x002CC991]
All men have mothers. This one called out for his, in the end.

Id: [0x002CC9B4]
Come in, but keep your voice down. You will alert Harald's men.

Id: [0x002CC9B5]
Hmm… A two-thousand weight of hacksilver. No less.

Id: [0x002CC9BB]
And all of us, even the most hideous, have souls.

Id: [0x002CC9C0]
Mold, everywhere. Stay here, Wulfhilda. I'll follow this trail…

Id: [0x002CC9C1]
Mold, everywhere. Stay here, Wulfhilda. I'll follow this trail…

Id: [0x002CCA1A]
O Lord, forgive this … man … his sins and grant unto him your grace and everlasting love.

Id: [0x002CCA1F]
I'll come back for you, I promise.

Id: [0x002CCA20]
I'll come back for you, I promise.

Id: [0x002CCA21]
Soma and Ubba, I apologize. I would have liked to offer better welcome after your long journey.

Id: [0x002CCA22]
I am only sorry we could not be here sooner.

Id: [0x002CCA23]
We'll need a short while to organize the men, then we'll set off as soon as we're able.

Id: [0x002CCA26]
Of course I can! Anything I want! Er … I just don't want to right now.

Id: [0x002CCA27]
What in Hel's name was that? A rabbit? Did you hope to nibble your opponents to death?

Id: [0x002CCA28]
What in Hel's name was that? A rabbit? Did you hope to nibble your opponents to death?

Id: [0x002CCA29]
I'd better get some reward for carrying you in that fight, or I'll stick your bobtailed arse in a stew.

Id: [0x002CCA2B]
I found a note on a dead traveler. It will lead you to treasures and secrets. At least I hope it will.

Id: [0x002CCA2E]
Shame. Been a long time since I fought a Saxon worth half a shit.

Id: [0x002CCA2F]
The thegn has been dealt with, so let's burn those silos.

Id: [0x002CCA30]

The eye of the storm. What lies within?

Id: [0x002CCA33]
The eye of the storm. What lies within?

Id: [0x002CCA3B]
And here are the storm-bringers. Explain this mischief.

Id: [0x002CCA3C]

I will take care of the camp myself. Once I have cleared it out, we will move our warriors in. I'll risk no more losses.

Id: [0x002CCA45]

Id: [0x002CCA49]
This tempest is our vengeance.

Id: [0x002CCA51]
Worry not, Eivor. You and I have many tales to tell yet. And our names ring out clear and with honor.

Id: [0x002CCA59]
Cold winds for a cold heart.

Id: [0x002CCA5A]
Three times we asked for Gunlodr's hand! Three times we demanded she choose between us!

Id: [0x002CCA5B]
Three times my brother's hideous face drove her away.

Id: [0x002CCA5C]
It's YOUR face, shit-wit! We're twins!

Id: [0x002CCA5E]
Ha! I will drink to that.[sobered] You have my thanks.

Id: [0x002CCA60]
Then let us say our farewells to this Wicker King, and then be on our way home.

Id: [0x002CCA62]
Gunnar. It's good to see a face I trust, even your frightful mug.

Id: [0x002CCA63]
Gunnar. It's good to see a face I trust, even your frightful mug.

Id: [0x002CCA64]
Ja, a tale. [more tired]A tale of Glowecestre. Beautiful land, full of damned fools.

Id: [0x002CCA65]
Ja, a tale. [more tired]A tale of Glowecestre. Beautiful land, full of damned fools.

Id: [0x002CCA66]
Anything for you, old friend.

Id: [0x002CCA67]
Anything for you, old friend.

Id: [0x002CCA6A]
Are you ready to depart?

Id: [0x002CCA70]
Come, see my wares!

Id: [0x002CCA71]
Hello and welcome.

Id: [0x002CCA72]
What can I get for you?

Id: [0x002CCA75]
Nothing else?

Id: [0x002CCA76]
All done?

Id: [0x002CCA77]
Finished looking around?

Id: [0x002CCA8F]
This could be very useful.

Id: [0x002CCA90]
You never know when this might come in handy.

Id: [0x002CCA91]
This could help you in your travels.

A fine steed.

Id: [0x002CCA93]
This one is loyal as they come!

Id: [0x002CCA94]
They would serve you well!

Id: [0x002CCA95]
Your raven will be the talk of the village!

Id: [0x002CCA96]
Now that is a sharp looking bird.

Id: [0x002CCA97]
Your raven will thank you.

Id: [0x002CCAAE]
Now THIS is a good looking raven!

Id: [0x002CCAAF]
Your raven is looking very intimidating!

Id: [0x002CCAB0]
An excellent choice.

Id: [0x002CCAB1]
Smart of you to keep honing your skills.

Id: [0x002CCAB2]
You are a much better rider now!

Id: [0x002CCAB3]
Your skill has improved!

Id: [0x002CCAB4]
You have an amazing eye for these things!

Id: [0x002CCABE]
Seems like you're expecting trouble.

Id: [0x002CCABF]
Glad to replenish your stock.

Id: [0x002CCAC1]
Welcome fair traveler, curious Child of His. I am Brendan of Ireland, and through light and voice have these stones spoken to me.

Id: [0x002CCAC2]
Here lies the markings of Him, where a second voice, higher than most, spoke to me again. Listen to all I have learned through prayer.

Id: [0x002CCAC3]
Long ago was a great and tragic war. The offspring of gods who lived before the deluge. I pray for these rebel angels who came before.

Id: [0x002CCAD4]
Always good to pick up new stock for the shop.

Id: [0x002CCAD5]
You always bring the strangest things.

Id: [0x002CCAD6]
Happy to take this off your hands.

Id: [0x002CCAD7]
This will be perfect for someone else.

Id: [0x002CCADE]
This is a different site. One resplendent in a manner unto itself. Where His light shines greatest. Today, I was warned of a harrowing depth.

Id: [0x002CCADF]
After the Nephilim, great battles were fought in resurrective Kingdoms of Christ. Many were lost in the fight, many more in the cataclysm that followed.

Id: [0x002CCAE0]
Today my Lord instructed me in plain words to travel o'er the ocean and seek the door behind which hides his fallen angel. I shall try, in His name. Amen.

Id: [0x002CCAE3]
That's a relief. I did not fancy asking Holger.

Id: [0x002CCAE4]
No rush. Just let me know.

Id: [0x002CCAE6]
Eivor. Shall we go?

Id: [0x002CCAE7]
Tarben.

Id: [0x002CCAE8]
Tarben.

Id: [0x002CCAE9]
Here in the Chew Valley, Old Kings of Hwicce still dance with the stones of the Nephilim. I have taught them of the power that sings here.

Id: [0x002CCAEA]
"How dare you tamper with these sacred threads," a voice scolded me. "You must leave me," he said. "Divorced from the Illuminat."

Id: [0x002CCAEB]
His voice waxes and wanes, but a soft song still finds me in my penance. I bend a knee and leave a grain of sand for the old winds.

Id: [0x002CCB05]
Here in the ancient Kingdom of Cent, the Jutes have brought me to where his fire burns through traces of the Nephilim.

Id: [0x002CCB06]
Here the Lord speaks to me again. He warns of betrayals, of struggles, of the trials of the First Ones. I do not always understand His message.

Id: [0x002CCB07]
If He is warning me, it is because he believes I am worthy. He says there is one angel still trapped, she who must be released, or joined. Must I find her?

Id: [0x002CCB09]
How did you like the taste of battle?

Id: [0x002CCB0A]
How did you like the taste of battle?

Id: [0x002CCB0C]
Your raven will look so good!

Id: [0x002CCB0D]
Even the gods will be jealous of your raven!

Id: [0x002CCB0E]
Now this looks like a bird fit for you!

Id: [0x002CCB10]
You are wise to stock up.

Id: [0x002CCB11]
These will come in very handy.

Id: [0x002CCB12]
Take care of yourself out there!

Id: [0x002CCB18]
Unbelievable! Even better than before!

Id: [0x002CCB1A]
Yes, this will look very good.

Id: [0x002CCB1C]
A steed worthy of you!

Id: [0x002CCB1D]
You would look very intimidating atop this horse!

Id: [0x002CCB1E]
Imagine charging into battle on this steed!

Id: [0x002CCB20]
Thank you! I always need more of these!

Id: [0x002CCB21]
Oh good, just what I was looking for!

Id: [0x002CCB22]
I'm only buying these because I like you.

Id: [0x002CCB23]

This could come in very handy.

Id: [0x002CCB41]
Now you will ride like the wind!

Id: [0x002CCB42]
Your horse will thank you for being a more skilled rider.

Id: [0x002CCB43]
It's like you were born to ride!

Id: [0x002CCB4D]
You look so strong and powerful!

Id: [0x002CCB4E]
This was an amazing choice!

Id: [0x002CCB4F]
Yes, this will strike fear into the hearts of your enemies!

Id: [0x002CCB51]
Hello there!

Id: [0x002CCB52]
Welcome!

Id: [0x002CCB53]
What can I tempt you with?

Id: [0x002CCB59]
Until next we meet!

Id: [0x002CCB5A]
Leaving already? Shame.

I hope to see you again soon!

Here, I, Brendan of Clonfert, servant of our Lord, do make my final inscription before this holy fount of light. My journey is ended.

Id: [0x002CCC0B]
For two and some years have I heeded the inner voice of my Lord, and followed it to this place to receive His word.

Id: [0x002CCC0D]
There's one more thing…

Id: [0x002CCC0E]
There's one more thing…

I have seen the gate with its ancient markings. I have heard the voice of His angel, calling me Beloved. Yet the way did not open.

Id: [0x002CCC18]
It has been years. I wonder what it will be like to once again feel a cool breeze, the warm sun, the scent of lavender?

Id: [0x002CCC1D]
Me to ride in on a winged horse? Cure the sick, the blind? His compliments are as blunt as his hammer.

So you've come to meet the family? Before you whisk my Brigid away to her life as a smithy's bride?

Id: [0x002CCC22]
If you will excuse me… I have matters to attend to.

Ah, yes, the shrine! [Faux-serious voice]And with so many thieves and fangs on the path. A fellow may fall in God's service.

Id: [0x002CCC2B]
I see I'm outmatched. Though a Dane joining in praise to Saint Kenhelm? God will weep.

Id: [0x002CCC2D]
Then, by my honor, I shall not rest until I return him to you safely. Aye, Tewdwr?

Id: [0x002CCC2E]
Then, by my honor, I shall not rest until I return him to you safely. Aye, Tewdwr?

Id: [0x002CCC34]
Paola, my love! Come look!

Id: [0x002CCC40]
I have a hand-fastening to oversee, an apprenticeship to officiate, and a pig to slaughter.

Id: [0x002CCC49]
And in case I wasn't clear, you will need to put up your hood for the trick to work.

Id: [0x002CCC4C]
Here in solitude, forever enclosed, I foreswear all earthly pleasures.

Id: [0x002CCC4D]
I buy and sell all manner of items. What's more, I am connected to a wide network of other traders, meaning I have access to nearly everything you could want, right here.

Id: [0x002CCC82]
[laugh]You can beat me, but you will not kill me. Not under Harald's truce.

Id: [0x002CCC8E]
Wherever destiny takes you, know that you always have a place at my table.

Id: [0x002CCC94]
And who better to lead us to glory than me? I was blooded before the age of ten and I led the greatest army Norway has ever seen.

Id: [0x002CCC95]
It lightens the heart.

Id: [0x002CCC96]
It lightens the heart.

Id: [0x002CCC98]
Are there priests in your lands? I have met a few, liked even fewer.

Id: [0x002CCC99]
Are there priests in your lands? I have met a few, liked even fewer.

Id: [0x002CCC9A]
Low in a mead of kine under a thorn, lieth poor Kenhelm king-born. Is this land not beautiful, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CCC9D]
Aye.

Id: [0x002CCC9E]
Aye.

Id: [0x002CCCAA]
Yes, yes, I see you both. What can I--

Id: [0x002CCCAB]
Collecting grain. Thirty silvers' worth if you can spare it. I do have the coin.

Id: [0x002CCCAC]
Of course. And you, ah, you take good care of yourself. Yeah?

Id: [0x002CCCAD]
(clears throat)

Id: [0x002CCCAE]
(clears throat)

Id: [0x002CCCBA]
I am not a babe in the woods in need of constant guard. Go on without me.

Id: [0x002CCCBC]
Yes, yes, your word. And when I see him, I will say you protected me from being skewered upon those devils' tusks.

Id: [0x002CCCC2]
We should return to Glowecestre. Unless you'd like to thank the little martyr here for tonight's feast?

Id: [0x002CCCC3]
We should return to Glowecestre. Unless you'd like to thank the little martyr here for tonight's feast?

Id: [0x002CCCC4]
I gave Cynon--

Id: [0x002CCCC5]
I gave Cynon--

Id: [0x002CCCCC]
S'plood. Cloven hoofed and sent by Lucifer himself! This land must be returned to God's grace.

Id: [0x002CCCCF]
No, but it is not enough for you. There is a hunger within you that will consume everyone around you if you are not careful.

Id: [0x002CCCD0]
Is that so bad?

Id: [0x002CCCD1]
Is that so bad?

Id: [0x002CCCD3]
We thought we had lost you, Eivor. For good this time.

Id: [0x002CCCD7]
I will be here. On my honor.

Id: [0x002CCCD8]
Do not go anywhere. I will only do this once.

Id: [0x002CCCD9]
Do not go anywhere. I will only do this once.

Id: [0x002CCCDB]
So, you invited me to a hoodening. What mischief is this?

Id: [0x002CCCDC]
So, you invited me to a hoodening. What mischief is this?

Id: [0x002CCCDE]
Your reputation. Heard folks say a band of hard-drinking, battle-scarred warriors had washed up on shore.

Id: [0x002CCCDF]
Tarben. What brought you to our clan?

Id: [0x002CCCE0]
Tarben. What brought you to our clan?

Id: [0x002CCCEB]
Thank you for this. Whether fur, meat, or bone, we will provide only the finest.

Id: [0x002CCCEC]
And if you intend to go hunting … consider bringing us your kills. We will prepare the hides and heads.

Id: [0x002CCCEE]
I'll keep that in mind. Enjoy your new home.

Id: [0x002CCCEF]
I'll keep that in mind. Enjoy your new home.

Id: [0x002CCCF7]
Eivor. You seem to be someone with a penchant for … trophies.

Id: [0x002CCCF9]
Your weapons show the marks of great battles. And you walk with a pride that speaks to your triumphs. Am I wrong?

Id: [0x002CCCFB]
To bolster our trade, of course. Wallace is the finest tanner and taxidermist in all of England.

Id: [0x002CCCFC]
If you defeat a rare and worthy creature, bring it to us. We will display it for you.

Id: [0x002CCD02]
I do like victories, but I rarely keep a record of them.

Id: [0x002CCD03]
I do like victories, but I rarely keep a record of them.

Id: [0x002CCD10]
They are much bigger up close!

Id: [0x002CCD11]
I do not think I can do this! I DO NOT THINK I CAN DO THIS!

Id: [0x002CCD12]
Now, win your honor!

Id: [0x002CCD13]
Now, win your honor!

Id: [0x002CCD14]
Yes. What can you do for me?

Id: [0x002CCD15]
Yes. What can you do for me?

Id: [0x002CCD16]
Back for more?

Id: [0x002CCD19]
The Fates have willed it so! But in future, bring your own metal ingots. I cannot forge them from empty air.

Id: [0x002CCD1A]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x002CCD1B]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x002CCD1F]
The king is not going anywhere.

Id: [0x002CCD20]
I could speak to Valka first. Get this weight off my mind.

Id: [0x002CCD21]
I could speak to Valka first. Get this weight off my mind.

Id: [0x002CCD35]
Want can I tempt you with today?

Id: [0x002CCD36]
What are you looking for?

Id: [0x002CCD37]
Here's what I have in stock.

Id: [0x002CCD3F]
Nothing else?

Id: [0x002CCD40]
Is that everything?

Id: [0x002CCD41]
Done shopping for the day?

Id: [0x002CCD44]
Until next time, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCD45]
Always a pleasure, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCD46]
I hope to see you soon!

Id: [0x002CCD47]
Don't be a stranger!

Id: [0x002CCD49]
Perfection. And I mean that.

Id: [0x002CCD4A]
I think that would be a...very good choice.

Id: [0x002CCD4B]
Only a true warrior could pull that off!

Id: [0x002CCD4C]
You should buy that.

Id: [0x002CCD4D]
Go on. Give it a try.

Id: [0x002CCD4E]
Made from only the finest materials!

Id: [0x002CCD5A]
Tempted?

Id: [0x002CCD5B]
This would suit you, I think.

Id: [0x002CCD5C]
Eivor. You should definitely get this.

Id: [0x002CCD5D]
This looks practically made for you.

Id: [0x002CCD5E]
I imported this with you in mind!

Id: [0x002CCD5F]
As a friend, I think you should buy this.

Id: [0x002CCD60]
You should buy that.

Id: [0x002CCD61]
Can't have too many!

Id: [0x002CCD62]
Only a fool would pass this up.

Id: [0x002CCD63]
I'm practically giving it away!

Id: [0x002CCD64]
You should get that. Honestly.

Id: [0x002CCD65]
You know that you have use for this.

Id: [0x002CCD66]
Yes! Great purchase!

Id: [0x002CCD67]
You'll get some much use out of this!

Id: [0x002CCD68]
There's always more where that came from!

Id: [0x002CCD69]
I'll be sure to keep these in stock for you.

Id: [0x002CCD6A]
Use it wisely!

Id: [0x002CCD6B]
An excellent purchase!

Id: [0x002CCD6C]
It will see many battles!

Id: [0x002CCD6D]
You've made the right choice with this one.

Id: [0x002CCD6E]
You won't regret this purchase!

Id: [0x002CCD6F]
A smart decision, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCD70]
Eivor. Yes. This is a brilliant choice.

Id: [0x002CCD71]
It looks made for you.

Id: [0x002CCD72]
I say this as a friend: you made a fine choice.

Id: [0x002CCD73]
Glad you like it!

Id: [0x002CCD74]
This is going to look so good!

Id: [0x002CCD75]
This was a smart purchase.

Id: [0x002CCD76]
I'm almost jealous at what a good purchase you've made!

Id: [0x002CCD77]
This was made for you.

Id: [0x002CCD79]
Perfect. I'll happily take this.

Id: [0x002CCD7A]
Mm, yes, I can resell these.

Id: [0x002CCD7B]
Anything you find, bring it to me.

Id: [0x002CCD7C]
I've got some new pieces with your name on them!

Id: [0x002CCD7D]
You're just in time for new stock!

Id: [0x002CCD7E]
I've been saving these just for you!

Id: [0x002CCD7F]
Always a pleasure doing business, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCD80]
Eager to find a new home for these!

Id: [0x002CCD81]
You know, you're my second-best customer.

Id: [0x002CCD89]
Until next time.

Id: [0x002CCD8A]
Bye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCD8B]
Make sure you talk to your raven regularly. They like that.

Id: [0x002CCD8C]
Take care.

Id: [0x002CCD8D]
All done?

Id: [0x002CCD8E]
Do you need anything else?

Id: [0x002CCD8F]
Nothing more today?

Id: [0x002CCD90]
I have something new to show you.

Id: [0x002CCD91]
I've got some new things in.

Id: [0x002CCD92]
Got a few new things.

Id: [0x002CCD93]
What can I do for you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CCD94]
Need help with anything?

Id: [0x002CCD95]
Looking for something?

Id: [0x002CCD96]
As a stablehand and a gameskeeper, I am happy to help you with any matter concerning your horses or your raven.

Id: [0x002CCD9D]
I could teach you to be a better rider.

Id: [0x002CCD9E]
You should improve your riding skills.

Id: [0x002CCD9F]
Let me give you a riding lesson.

Id: [0x002CCDA0]
There are better ways to ride.

Id: [0x002CCDA1]
Your riding skills aren't great.

Id: [0x002CCDA2]
Much better.

Id: [0x002CCDA3]
Now you can ride!

Id: [0x002CCDA4]
I'd trust you on any horse now.

Id: [0x002CCDA5]
You are a fast learner.

Id: [0x002CCDA6]
Remember everything I taught you.

Id: [0x002CCDA7]
I like this one a lot.

Id: [0x002CCDA8]
Your raven will really stand out.

Id: [0x002CCDA9]
This is a very good look.

Id: [0x002CCDAA]
This one's my favorite.

Id: [0x002CCDAB]
This is the one. I think.

Id: [0x002CCDAC]
This one likes a little clover. As a treat.

Id: [0x002CCDAD]
This one is very kind.

Id: [0x002CCDAE]
They've got a bit of a temper. A little like you.

Id: [0x002CCDAF]
They need a lot of exercise.

Id: [0x002CCDB0]
I used to ride their grand mother.

Id: [0x002CCDB1]
Your raven will look so smart like this.

Id: [0x002CCDB2]
I think they'll really like this.

Id: [0x002CCDB3]
Hmm. An interesting choice.

Id: [0x002CCDB4]
This will make your raven look powerful.

Id: [0x002CCDB5]
Your raven will look brave now.

Id: [0x002CCDB6]
Take good care of them. Please.

Id: [0x002CCDB7]
I'm trusting you to take care of them, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCDB8]
Take care of them and they'll take care of you.

Id: [0x002CCDB9]
This one is very loyal.

Id: [0x002CCDBA]
I think this one will like you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCDBB]
Let me prepare your horse.

Id: [0x002CCDBC]
I'm just going to get your horse ready.

Id: [0x002CCDBD]
It will only take me a moment to get your horse.

Id: [0x002CCDBE]
Please be patient while I fetch your horse.

Id: [0x002CCDBF]
I'll be right back with your horse.

Id: [0x002CCDC0]
Dyeing a raven isn't that hard. You'd be surprised.

Id: [0x002CCDC1]
This will just take a moment.

Id: [0x002CCDC2]
Please ask your raven to stop moving.

Id: [0x002CCDC3]
You raven looks brilliant.

Id: [0x002CCDC4]
I really enjoy doing this.

Id: [0x002CCDC5]
Let me teach you, Eivor. It would be my honor.

Id: [0x002CCDC6]
You are an excellent rider, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCDC7]
You should ask your raven what they'd like.

Id: [0x002CCDC8]
This one can be lazy sometimes.

Id: [0x002CCDC9]
Yes. This is very good.

Id: [0x002CCDCA]
I'll miss you, friend. Take care of Eivor for me.

Id: [0x002CCDCB]
P-Please wait.

Id: [0x002CCDCC]
Like a brand new bird.

Id: [0x002CCDCE]
If you find any Roman artifacts out there in the world, bring them here. I'll appraise them and see they're given a good home. With me.

Id: [0x002CCDD9]
Bonum Fortunam in your travels, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCDDA]
Vale!

Id: [0x002CCDDB]
Die dulci fruimini!

Id: [0x002CCDDC]
Vale, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCDE0]
Well enough, butcher.

Id: [0x002CCDE1]
How have you been, Gwenydd?

Id: [0x002CCDE2]
How have you been, Gwenydd?

Id: [0x002CCDE3]
What have you brought for me?

Id: [0x002CCDE4]
Let me see what you have.

Id: [0x002CCDE5]
Show me what you found.

Id: [0x002CCDE7]
Wonderful! This should complete my collection.

Id: [0x002CCDEB]
Bring me more like this.

Id: [0x002CCDEC]
I could use more artifacts like this.

Id: [0x002CCDED]
I want more of these artifacts.

Id: [0x002CCDEE]
There should be more like this out there.

Id: [0x002CCE00]
Happy hunting!

Id: [0x002CCE01]
Say hi to Petra if you see her.

Id: [0x002CCE02]
Hope to see you again soon!

Id: [0x002CCE03]
Until next time.

Id: [0x002CCE0B]
When you hunt any animal, bring it here for a trade. And if you get something really special, I'm happy to mount it.

Id: [0x002CCE0C]
Nothing else?

Id: [0x002CCE0D]
Done for now?

Id: [0x002CCE0E]
All done?

Id: [0x002CCE0F]
What can I do for you?

Id: [0x002CCE10]
What do you need?

Id: [0x002CCE11]
Here's what I can do for you.

Id: [0x002CCE12]
Well done, Eivor. You're better than Petra. Though... you might want to keep that quiet!

Id: [0x002CCE13]
You've done great work, Eivor! The lands are safer and the settlement has prospered thanks to you.

Id: [0x002CCE1A]
This will help us.

Id: [0x002CCE1B]
This will be a great help.

Id: [0x002CCE1C]
Excellent!

Id: [0x002CCE1D]
I knew I could count on you!

Id: [0x002CCE1E]
Good! This will help the settlement.

Id: [0x002CCE1F]
Thank you, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCE20]
Thanks, Eivor. You're almost as good a hunter as Petra.

Id: [0x002CCE21]
Thanks for your help.

Id: [0x002CCE22]
Good work, Eivor. You and Petra are incredible.

Id: [0x002CCE23]
I know you have many things to do so I am honored that you take the time to hunt for me.

Id: [0x002CCE24]
I'm looking for this.

Id: [0x002CCE25]
I'd pay well for this.

Id: [0x002CCE26]
I could really use this.

Id: [0x002CCE27]
Bringing me this would be helpful.

Id: [0x002CCE28]
We always have need for this.

Id: [0x002CCE2A]
Can you not rekindle the flame that once burned hot?

Id: [0x002CCE2B]
Can you not rekindle the flame that once burned hot?

Id: [0x002CCE62]
I thought long and hard on a gift worthy of you.

Id: [0x002CCE92]
Anything else I can do for you?

Id: [0x002CCE93]
Finished?

Id: [0x002CCE94]
Nothing more?

Id: [0x002CCE95]
That could look good on you.

Id: [0x002CCE96]
Yes! This is a good look for you!

Id: [0x002CCE97]
Only you could make this look good.

Id: [0x002CCE98]
You would look powerful like this!

Id: [0x002CCE99]
I could do that, if you wanted.

Id: [0x002CCE9A]
One of my favorites!

Id: [0x002CCEA1]
Until next time, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCEA2]
A good day to you!

Id: [0x002CCEA3]
Until I see you next!

Id: [0x002CCEA4]
Goodbye, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCEA5]
What are you looking for today?

Id: [0x002CCEA6]
Looking to get something new?

Id: [0x002CCEA7]
Feeling like a change today?

Id: [0x002CCEA8]
I've been working on some designs.

Id: [0x002CCEA9]
There's some new things for you to look at.

Id: [0x002CCEAA]
I'm proud of the new styles I've been working on.

Id: [0x002CCEAB]
Make sure you look at my new designs.

Id: [0x002CCEAC]
I have some new styles for you!

Id: [0x002CCEC9]
If you would ever like to get a new tattoo, you can come to me. I'm open to inspiration, as well, so feel free to bring any designs you find.

Id: [0x002CCECD]
You'll want to speak to the dockmaster, Grigorii. I've seen him talking with her before.

Id: [0x002CCED0]
Ah! I missed the smell of this land.

Id: [0x002CCED1]
Forget I said anything!

Id: [0x002CCED3]
This suits you!

Id: [0x002CCED4]
If you're complimented, tell them of Tove!

Id: [0x002CCED5]
There. Done. I hope you like it!

Id: [0x002CCED6]
This will make many envious!

Id: [0x002CCED7]
You look even more intimidating, were that possible.

Id: [0x002CCED8]
It suits you.

Id: [0x002CCED9]
Befitting of a leader!

Id: [0x002CCEDA]
Do you like it? I hope you like it.

Id: [0x002CCEDB]
I did a good job on this one!

Id: [0x002CCEDC]
You look strong!

Id: [0x002CCEDD]
One of my best pieces!

Id: [0x002CCEDE]
An imposing look!

Id: [0x002CCEDF]
If you want to deal with your raiders, you come through me. I'll make sure they're ready for you, and keep them in fighting shape.

Id: [0x002CCEE2]
Looking for more raiders?

Id: [0x002CCEE3]
Plenty of raiders to chose from.

Id: [0x002CCEE4]
There are some good recruits here. Just don't tell them I said so.

Id: [0x002CCEE5]
Done?

Id: [0x002CCEE6]
Found who you needed?

Id: [0x002CCEE7]
Good for now?

Id: [0x002CCEEE]
Be well.

Id: [0x002CCEEF]
Fight well.

Id: [0x002CCEF0]
Farewell.

Id: [0x002CCEF1]
Goodbye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCEF2]
Have a few new recruits.

Id: [0x002CCEF3]
There's fresh blood in the barracks-- fighters, I mean.

Id: [0x002CCEF4]
There're new recruits ready for battle.

Id: [0x002CCEF5]
A strong choice.

Id: [0x002CCEF6]
Very well trained, them.

Id: [0x002CCEF7]
A talented fighter, that one.

Id: [0x002CCEF8]
Battle-proven and powerful.

Id: [0x002CCEF9]
Faster than they look.

Id: [0x002CCEFA]
A commanding warrior.

Id: [0x002CCEFB]
Good. They will serve you well.

Id: [0x002CCEFC]
Good choice, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCEFD]
They will do well on your next raid.

Id: [0x002CCEFE]
An especially talented fighter.

Id: [0x002CCEFF]
Oh, this one's shown real skill.

Id: [0x002CCF00]
Real scrapper, this one.

Id: [0x002CCF01]
I've travlled this great country and found all manner of secrets, plus a few points of interest. For a price, my maps can be yours.

Id: [0x002CCF04]
Keep exploring!

Id: [0x002CCF05]
A good day to you!

Id: [0x002CCF06]
Be safe out there.

Id: [0x002CCF07]
Farewell, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CCF08]
I'm here if you need anything more.

Id: [0x002CCF09]
Done for now?

Id: [0x002CCF0A]
That's it?

Id: [0x002CCF0B]
Looking to explore?

Id: [0x002CCF0C]
I can help you find just about anything.

Id: [0x002CCF0D]
What can I do for you?

Id: [0x002CCF0E]
I have some new maps!

Id: [0x002CCF0F]
I've charted new maps.

Id: [0x002CCF10]
There are new maps for you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCF17]
Take a look at the new maps I made.

Id: [0x002CCF18]
There are new maps!

Id: [0x002CCF19]
I'll add this location to your map.

Id: [0x002CCF1A]
There. You should be able to find it easily now.

Id: [0x002CCF1B]
I've marked the location on your map.

Id: [0x002CCF1C]
Let me update your map with this.

Id: [0x002CCF1D]
Your map has been revised!

Id: [0x002CCF1E]
It's on your map now!

Id: [0x002CCF1F]
This could be very useful.

Id: [0x002CCF20]
You might find something interesting there.

Id: [0x002CCF21]
Always easier to follow a map.

Id: [0x002CCF22]
This was a fun one to chart!

Id: [0x002CCF23]
I almost fell to my death mapping this one!

Id: [0x002CCF24]
Keep an eye out for wild animals here.

Id: [0x002CCF25]
Have you brought me something?

Id: [0x002CCF26]
Have you been hunting?

Id: [0x002CCF27]
What can I do for you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CCF28]
Nothing more for me today?

Id: [0x002CCF29]
Will that be all?

Id: [0x002CCF2A]
Have we completed our business?

Id: [0x002CCF31]
May your gods smile upon you.

Id: [0x002CCF32]
Be well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCF33]
Until next we meet.

Id: [0x002CCF34]
Stay vigilant.

Id: [0x002CCF35]
When you eliminate any member of the Order of Ancients, bring their medallion to me. It will help to keep a tally of how many still live...

Id: [0x002CCF38]
England is as free of its plague as it has ever been. But I will stay vigilant. Vermin have a way of creeping back in when you least expect them. Thank you for your service.

Id: [0x002CCF39]
Thank you. I expect there are yet more to claim.

Id: [0x002CCF3A]
There are more medallions to collect.

Id: [0x002CCF3B]
You have done well but there are more still.

Id: [0x002CCF3C]
Keep this up and the land will be free of these monsters!

Id: [0x002CCF3D]
There's more to be done, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CCF3E]
Ah good. I hope this one did not give you too much trouble.

Id: [0x002CCF3F]
Another one? You are certainly proficient.

Id: [0x002CCF40]
One more gone. The world is brighter for it.

Id: [0x002CCF41]
It gives me joy to take these from you.

Id: [0x002CCF62]
Aye. I've been mounting Petra's trophies for years. And she's a discerning woman.

Id: [0x002CCF63]
In all things.

Id: [0x002CCF68]
You are not. Why do you ask?

Id: [0x002CCF69]
You are not. Why do you ask?

Id: [0x002CCF6A]
A good idea. Keepsakes to adorn the longhouse. Thank you, Petra.

Id: [0x002CCF6B]
A good idea. Keepsakes to adorn the longhouse. Thank you, Petra.

Id: [0x002CCF72]
I know the men she means. They're staying at the church near Brisleah Farm. Come, meet them.

Id: [0x002CCF76]
Their leader, Hrothgar, is a great man … for a heathen. He is no cattle killer.

Id: [0x002CCF77]
That woman is certain a nearby band of warriors caused these maulings. We have no other clues.

Id: [0x002CCF78]
That woman is certain a nearby band of warriors caused these maulings. We have no other clues.

Id: [0x002CCF84]
Yet you only deal in opal? Is there so much to be found in England?

Id: [0x002CCF85]
Yet you only deal in opal? Is there so much to be found in England?

Id: [0x002CCF87]
Saints save me!

Id: [0x002CCF88]
The maulings have drawn in a starving wolf pack.

Id: [0x002CCF89]
No, I am unhurt. Thank you, Dane. I … misjudged you.

Id: [0x002CCF8A]
I would rather not be worrying about them come Yuletide.

Id: [0x002CCFA1]
This will not take long.

Id: [0x002CCFB1]
What's more, Audun is worried they will come for the archives next.

Id: [0x002CCFB6]
They have even burned people alive who refuse to hand over what they demand.

Id: [0x002CCFBA]
These beasts came scavenging for fresh meat.

Id: [0x002CCFBC]
I'm searching for my best milch-cow. She's missing.

Id: [0x002CCFBD]
No need. But tell me what happened.

Id: [0x002CCFBE]
No need. But tell me what happened.

Id: [0x002CCFBF]
I meant, why are you out here with the dead cattle again?

Id: [0x002CCFC0]
I meant, why are you out here with the dead cattle again?

Id: [0x002CCFC2]
This is getting out of hand! I hope you have the final name.

Id: [0x002CCFC4]
Texts like this gospel of Matthew were created for more than just perusing.

Id: [0x002CCFC6]
No, but I found a Danish axe. It belongs to Hrothgar, leader of their war-band.

Id: [0x002CCFC9]
Yes! He brandishes it about the village, demanding ale.

Id: [0x002CCFCA]
And you found her?

Id: [0x002CCFCB]
And you found her?

Id: [0x002CCFCC]
You know for a fact this axe is his?

Id: [0x002CCFCD]
You know for a fact this axe is his?

Id: [0x002CCFD7]
Grendel must have tracked this mold here, but from where?

Id: [0x002CCFD8]
Grendel must have tracked this mold here, but from where?

Id: [0x002CCFDF]
The source of the mold must be near.

Id: [0x002CCFE0]
The source of the mold must be near.

Id: [0x002CD01D]
They are weakened. Let us finish this!

Id: [0x002CD01E]
They are weakened. Let us finish this!

Id: [0x002CD020]
Your allies are on their way. We must be patient.

Id: [0x002CD021]
This is not the sum of my forces. Where are the rest?

Id: [0x002CD022]
This is not the sum of my forces. Where are the rest?

Id: [0x002CD026]
No need, no need. I'll do the rest myself, bring it in and put it where I like.

Id: [0x002CD028]
Need help with your grain?

Id: [0x002CD029]
Need help with your grain?

Id: [0x002CD02A]
All right. It was good to speak with you, Tarben. A welcome diversion.

Id: [0x002CD02B]
All right. It was good to speak with you, Tarben. A welcome diversion.

Id: [0x002CD02E]
Is that your usual vendor? He seemed … a little surprised to see you.

Id: [0x002CD02F]
Is that your usual vendor? He seemed … a little surprised to see you.

Id: [0x002CD032]
Come on lad, show the Dane yer mettle.

Id: [0x002CD038]
I've burned the silos already. Just had to be sure the job was done.

Id: [0x002CD039]
I've burned the silos already. Just had to be sure the job was done.

Id: [0x002CD03E]
I've already put some of this town to the torch, but there is more to do here.

Id: [0x002CD03F]
I've already put some of this town to the torch, but there is more to do here.

Id: [0x002CD056]
There you go.

Id: [0x002CD057]
It's yours now.

Id: [0x002CD058]
Use it well.

Id: [0x002CD059]
May it serve you well.

Id: [0x002CD05A]
Glad to be of service.

Id: [0x002CD05B]
Here you go.

Id: [0x002CD05C]
Is that what you seek?

Id: [0x002CD05D]
Fine choice, that one.

Id: [0x002CD05E]
Can I get that for you?

Id: [0x002CD05F]
That'd serve you well.

Id: [0x002CD060]
Gunnar's work astounds me.

Id: [0x002CD061]
A good choice.

Id: [0x002CD062]
Good traveller! What seek you, perhaps I can help?

Id: [0x002CD063]
Well met! Information! I have it, do you need it?

Id: [0x002CD064]
A fellow adventurer! Need to know the lie of the land?

Id: [0x002CD06E]
Death?

Id: [0x002CD06F]
Death?

Id: [0x002CD090]
Soft words from a heartless heathen!

Id: [0x002CD114]
Hmm. Pity.

Id: [0x002CD115]
Perhaps later.

Id: [0x002CD116]
Another time then.

Id: [0x002CD117]
I have nothing more to share, for now.

Id: [0x002CD118]
I'll need some time to collect more information.

Id: [0x002CD119]
That's all I have for now. Find me later.

Id: [0x002CD11A]
Now, show me your map... there is a place... here.

Id: [0x002CD11B]
Right... let me show you something... on your map.

Id: [0x002CD11C]
Look here... this spot I'll mark on your map... a place I know

Id: [0x002CD128]
Not great, as far as deaths go, but neither was he.

Id: [0x002CD129]
Not great, as far as deaths go, but neither was he.

Id: [0x002CD12E]
I did it! What an incredible fight!

Id: [0x002CD257]
Good. I'll lead the way.

Id: [0x002CD258]
If you wish to face your old friends, I am ready when you are.

Id: [0x002CD259]
If you wish to face your old friends, I am ready when you are.

Id: [0x002CD25A]
I need no weapons but these hands!

Id: [0x002CD25C]
You dance better than you fight.

Id: [0x002CD25E]
A shameful trick, Wolf-Kissed. You are your father's child.

Id: [0x002CD260]
I have a perch for each of you ravens!

Id: [0x002CD269]
The merchant who secures sale and gets the silver should take a strong cut. It will encourage further glory in the profits.

Id: [0x002CD26A]

Id: [0x002CD271]
She does. I told her to find another drengr. Then she cried. I do not know why. Sadness can be so silly.

Id: [0x002CD273]
Because we are friends. In love, hurt is different from that of friendship. Lovers must betray one another, as the sun rises and sets.

Id: [0x002CD274]
Your meanness will haunt you one day, Sigurd. I would never betray you.

Id: [0x002CD277]
You're a cheery one. You should drink more if the past pains you that much.

Id: [0x002CD279]
Nothing there for me now. Only bad memories and buried corpses.

Id: [0x002CD27A]
Nothing there for me now. Only bad memories and buried corpses.

Id: [0x002CD27B]
I like to remember the past, Dag. But I do not wish to live there.

Id: [0x002CD27C]
I like to remember the past, Dag. But I do not wish to live there.

Id: [0x002CD27E]
Look there, Eivor. Your childhood home.

Id: [0x002CD27F]
I want you to know … should it come to blows with my old crew, I can handle it myself. Forgiving me is all the work you need to do.

Id: [0x002CD282]
They'll want me back. They'll want me to be the man they think I am. Monstrous and massive.

Id: [0x002CD284]
I shouldn't think so, no. Nothing like that. It's not how Wilf operates.

Id: [0x002CD289]
So what do they want from you now?

Id: [0x002CD28A]
So what do they want from you now?

Id: [0x002CD28B]
Before we're spotted, tell me what I should expect here. Will they attack us on sight?

Id: [0x002CD28C]
Before we are spotted, tell me what I should expect here. Will they attack us on sight?

Id: [0x002CD2C9]
I'm trapped! Help. I've been trapped by a witch!

Id: [0x002CD2CB]
I hear you out there. The witch locked me in and left the key somewhere. Find that key!

Id: [0x002CD2CD]
Don't go! She'll come back and boil me in a pot! I'll be served with turnips for supper!

Id: [0x002CD2D0]
Hello? This is the slowest rescue I've ever seen! Could you find the stupid key and get me out?

Id: [0x002CD2D1]
You naughty boy! Just look at this mess. The house has been upended! Who is this?

Id: [0x002CD2D3]
I am no witch. I am the kindest, sweetest mum to ever lock her lad in a house. How else teach you not to pick your nose?

Id: [0x002CD2D5]
O, many. See this salt blasted hair? Took a pummeling over the years, all that sea water. Feels like hay now.

Id: [0x002CD2D7]
Hah! You are very quick. And sturdy by the looks of you.

Id: [0x002CD2DE]
I belong to another clan. What are you doing away from yours?

Id: [0x002CD2DF]
I belong to another clan. What are you doing away from yours?

Id: [0x002CD2E1]
I should keep an eye out for this old raider's home if I ever am in Repton.

Id: [0x002CD2E2]
I should keep an eye out for this old raider's home if ever I am in Repton.

Id: [0x002CD2E3]
Ah! You've come back. Why are you wasting your time with me?

Id: [0x002CD2E4]
(humming) Care to sing a song? Helps me pass the time.

Id: [0x002CD2E6]
This must be that old raider's place. He said he wanted me to have his things.

Id: [0x002CD2E7]
This must be that old raider's place. He said he wanted me to have his things.

Id: [0x002CD2E9]
Is that everything?

Id: [0x002CD2EA]
Is that everything?

Id: [0x002CD2EC]
This crate is filled with songs. Must have taken a long time to write them all out. I should return it to the old raider.

Id: [0x002CD2ED]
This crate is filled with songs. Must have taken a long time to write them all out. I should return this crate to the old raider.

Id: [0x002CD2EE]
That all for now?

Id: [0x002CD2EF]
All right, if you're done.

Id: [0x002CD2F1]
Not a bad one, eh?

Id: [0x002CD2F2]
I'd consider that if I were you.

Id: [0x002CD2F3]
That would work.

Id: [0x002CD2FD]
So long.

Id: [0x002CD2FE]
See you later, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CD301]
Have a look.

Id: [0x002CD302]
Come what I have.

Id: [0x002CD304]
Thought up a few new ones for you.

Id: [0x002CD305]
Tove and I have some new designs.

Id: [0x002CD309]
If you need something tattooed, you come here and I do it. And you can bring me whatever designs you come upon, too.

Id: [0x002CD30A]
Looks good.

Id: [0x002CD30B]
You won't regret this one.

Id: [0x002CD30C]
Interesting. I like it.

Id: [0x002CD310]
The mark of a warrior.

Id: [0x002CD311]
Tove helped draw that one.

Id: [0x002CD312]
I nearly put this one on myself.

Id: [0x002CD317]
Eivor, a word.

Id: [0x002CD319]
You find it strange because you are wrong.

Id: [0x002CD31B]
Our clan, the Hidden Ones, have been fighting with Kjotve's Order for centuries.

Id: [0x002CD31D]
We did. Or rather, we came so that Hytham could kill him. My apprentice has been studying this target for many months.

Id: [0x002CD320]
Not his reputation alone, but the order to which he belongs. Something of a rival clan to our own.

Id: [0x002CD323]
I understand. All that matters is that Kjotve dies this day.

Id: [0x002CD324]
On that, we are agreed.

Id: [0x002CD326]
Basim. Hytham. This feud is not yours, yet you fight it all the same. I find that strange.

Id: [0x002CD327]
Basim. Hytham. This feud is not yours, yet you fight it all the same. I find that strange.

Id: [0x002CD328]
You came from Miklagard to kill Kjotve yourself?

Id: [0x002CD329]
You came from Miklagard to kill Kjotve yourself?

Id: [0x002CD32A]
Is Kjotve's reputation so great outside Norway?

Id: [0x002CD32B]
Is Kjotve's reputation so great outside Norway?

Id: [0x002CD32C]
Hytham, I mean no disrespect to you or the … Hidden Ones, but Kjotve is mine. My family's honor is at stake.

Id: [0x002CD32D]
Hytham, I mean no disrespect to you or the Hidden Ones, but Kjotve is mine. My family's honor is at stake.

Id: [0x002CD401]
Grendel? Is that you, my boy? Grendel? Come to Mother.

Id: [0x002CD403]
I merely sung the truth! Your brutish threats hold no power over a bard like me.

Id: [0x002CD404]
I could kill you with a single swing, but I'd rather not stain my weapon.

Id: [0x002CD405]
I could kill you with a single swing, but I would rather not stain my weapon.

Id: [0x002CD406]
Grendel? Grendel! Is that you? Answer me!

Id: [0x002CD40D]
'Tis the fate of a bard such as I! We give and give and get nothing back. [singsong]So it goes.  Farewell, generous champion!

Id: [0x002CD40F]
Your kennings are weak. However, you make up for it with your clever tongue.

Id: [0x002CD410]
Your kennings are weak. However, you make up for it with your clever tongue.

Id: [0x002CD44C]
Aww. Pig poop! He got past me!

Id: [0x002CD46A]
Got you, little mouse-biter.

Id: [0x002CD46B]
Got you, little mouse-biter.

Id: [0x002CD46C]
Wow! Nali hasn't let anyone touch him since old Kottr died. But he sure loves you!

Id: [0x002CD474]
Did you hear? That blizzard was all on account of some angry suitors Gunlodr rejected.

Id: [0x002CD475]
Men! Do they ever really grow up, or do they just increase their ability to do damage?

Id: [0x002CD477]
Looks like I have another raider.

Id: [0x002CD478]
Looks like I have another raider.

Id: [0x002CD483]
When your damned complaining does.

Id: [0x002CD493]
O, It was so much easier to sneak around behind Grognir's back when you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.

Id: [0x002CD495]
Tewdwr's disappeared. And they think I murdered him. But I've no memory of him meeting his end at my blade.

Id: [0x002CD496]
Tewdwr's disappeared. And they think I murdered him. But I've no memory of him meeting his end at my blade.

Id: [0x002CD498]
Two mighty Jotnar dwelt close to the sky. Their faces the same, they bewildered the eye.

Id: [0x002CD499]
They came down to Utgard, fair Gunlodr to try. "Marry us, Gunlodr." But Gunlodr said "Why?"

Id: [0x002CD49A]
"My books are my husbands, I've no need of more. Your breath is appalling, your manners are poor."

Id: [0x002CD49B]
"You boast of your might, but it's minds I adore. So thank you for coming, now there is the door."

Id: [0x002CD49C]
Mother, if the stranger wants more of the herbs, they can talk to the Druid Halewyn?

Id: [0x002CD49E]
That is his debt, not mine!

Id: [0x002CD49F]
That is his debt, not mine!

Id: [0x002CD4A0]
Heavy with silver, are you?

Id: [0x002CD4B1]
Tell it to your god.

Id: [0x002CD4B2]
Tell it to your god.

Id: [0x002CD4B9]
Aye. But you're an Aesir. Your kind killed my brothers. So I'll be keeping you both awhile till I decide what to do with you.

Id: [0x002CD4BB]
Nobody is keeping me!

Id: [0x002CD4BC]
Nobody is keeping me!

Id: [0x002CD4C0]
Actually, I would call them "potential facts." Now release me? Please?

Id: [0x002CD4C1]
You would reward me with rumors?

Id: [0x002CD4C2]
You would reward me with rumors?

Id: [0x002CD4C5]
Hop along, now.

Id: [0x002CD4C6]
Hop along, now.

Id: [0x002CD4C7]
That was uncalled for.

Id: [0x002CD4E0]
Eivor! The breath-of-battle rises from my brow! The skalds will sing of this night!

Id: [0x002CD4E1]
Ships are coming!

Id: [0x002CD4E2]
Good day! A new customer!

Fascinating. Was that your final vision?

Id: [0x002CD4E7]
In Jotunheim, I sought and found a mead of incredible power.

In Jotunheim, I sought and found a mead of incredible power.

Id: [0x002CD4E9]
It promised a strange effect. To drink it would deliver me from death. Shield me from the destruction of Ragnarok.

By this mead I hoped to live beyond my own death, well into the future.

By this mead I hoped to live beyond my own death, well into the future.

Id: [0x002CD4ED]
Can I help you with anything?

Id: [0x002CD4F1]
All was fire and ash, a chaos like a foul wind from the depths of Ginnungagap.

Id: [0x002CD4F2]
All was fire and ash, a chaos like a foul wind from the depths of Ginnungagap.

Id: [0x002CD4F3]
But we were ready for the coming storm. Eight of us, we drank the mead, then stood and marched to our doom.

Id: [0x002CD4F4]
But we were ready for the coming storm. Eight of us, we drank the mead, then stood and marched to our doom.

Id: [0x002CD4F5]
That. And that was the end of the Nornir's prophecy.

Id: [0x002CD4F6]
That was the end of the Nornir's prophecy.

Id: [0x002CD5A0]
Beautiful! Beautiful, put them here.

Id: [0x002CD5A1]
We have your goods.

Id: [0x002CD5A2]
We have your goods.

Id: [0x002CD5AE]
I will follow you, if only to feel the grass beneath my feet. I will repent when I return.

Id: [0x002CD5AF]
How can you be at peace with the world if you live beyond its reach?

Id: [0x002CD5B0]
How can you be at peace with the world if you live beyond its reach?

Come outside. Your god won't be angry for just a few moments. Come. Come.

Id: [0x002CD5B2]
Come outside. Your god won't be angry for just a few moments. Come. Come.

Id: [0x002CD5B3]
I know the pain it can inflict.

Id: [0x002CD645]
I came here after the dark times. Pestilence and hunger. The death of my father.

Id: [0x002CD646]
Ah! The world! It is so beautiful.

Id: [0x002CD649]
Tarquin? My thegn, what has happened?

Id: [0x002CD64B]
O, God, no! It was only a game. A romp! My dear Tarquin, how could you!

Id: [0x002CD64D]
All a part of the seduction! O, God! You really thought my life was in danger?

Id: [0x002CD64E]
And you risked your own … you, o, you are so brave. A fine protector.

Id: [0x002CD651]
Please, you must fight for me. Who knows what lurks below? What vile people might come to harm me!

Id: [0x002CD653]
Your captor fled. Felt a little soft for my liking. What are you really doing in there?

Id: [0x002CD654]
Your captor fled. Felt a little soft for my liking. What are you really doing in there?

Id: [0x002CD655]
I saw a man holding you against your will.

Id: [0x002CD656]
I saw a man holding you against your will.

Id: [0x002CD657]
Tell me you are joking.

Id: [0x002CD658]
Tell me you are joking.

Id: [0x002CD659]
If I do, will you come out?

Id: [0x002CD65A]
If I do, will you come out?

Id: [0x002CD65B]
I need a protector, stout and resolute! Please, stand guard below.

Id: [0x002CD660]
We are of Thy world, my Lord, and thereof, we are grateful. Leaves fall, turn to dust, and from dust, trees of green arise.

Id: [0x002CD670]
Is someone out there? A witch, I tell you, lured me into this house and shut me in!

Id: [0x002CD6A4]
Do you like the snow, Sigurd?

Id: [0x002CD6A5]
Snow like arrows? The skald in you speaks! I admit, it does calm me down some.

Id: [0x002CD6A6]
If everyone sat and watched the soft, chunky snow fall, and said nothing … nothing at all, we would all be happier.

Id: [0x002CD6A7]
Snow makes for a poor plowing bed. That's what I know!

Id: [0x002CD6AA]
Ah, well. My father says the walls will drip mead, your fingers will sing, and your feet will grow wings!

Id: [0x002CD6AB]
Jewels will fall from the mouths of wolves … butter jumps from barrel to bread.

Id: [0x002CD6AC]
And the mud smells of lavender. I heard that once.

Id: [0x002CD6AD]
Yes. And when your eyes command rain, it pours hot drops, your smile craves sun, the clouds part like curtains.

Id: [0x002CD6AE]
Bloody, shiny, unbreakable Valhalla … one day our slaughter-reeds will guide us there, my Eivor.

Id: [0x002CD6AF]
Eivor, this isn't your fight. You don't need to do this.

Id: [0x002CD6B3]
You found it!

Id: [0x002CD6B7]
All right. Wait here … and stay out of sight.

Id: [0x002CD6B8]
All right. Wait here … and stay out of sight.

Id: [0x002CD6B9]
There, Wilf's stolen goods.

Id: [0x002CD6BA]
There, Wilf's stolen goods.

Id: [0x002CD6BB]
This is everything. I'll return to Tarben.

Id: [0x002CD6BC]
This is everything. I'll return to Tarben.

Id: [0x002CD6BF]
Is this the sort of work you often did with Wilf and your family of marauders?

Id: [0x002CD6C0]
Is this the sort of work you did with Wilf and your family of marauders?

Id: [0x002CD6C1]
That song … you have spent some days on a longship.

That song … you have spent some days on a longship.

Id: [0x002CD6C4]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x002CD6C5]
Where are you running to?

Id: [0x002CD6C9]
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do. It will take me weeks to put this place in order.

Id: [0x002CD6D0]
[laugh]We had a grand time!

Id: [0x002CD6D9]
No.

Id: [0x002CD6DB]
O, yes? How so?

Id: [0x002CD6DC]
You see Northumbria there? It's ruled by Danes now. Halfdan Ragnarsson. Ubba and Ivarr's older brother.

Id: [0x002CD6DD]
Good to know. I'll make a note of it.

Id: [0x002CD705]
So slow.

Id: [0x002CD706]
You going to start?

Id: [0x002CD707]
You're sweating!

Id: [0x002CD708]
You're a bit green friend...

Id: [0x002CD709]
Ha! Drool-monger!

Id: [0x002CD70A]
Got some on your boots...

Id: [0x002CD70B]
Don't hurl into the barrel, ok?

Id: [0x002CD70C]
Be kissing a flagstone soon.

Id: [0x002CD70D]
Too strong for you?

Id: [0x002CD70E]
Staggering already?

Id: [0x002CD714]
Haaaa (hic)!

Id: [0x002CD715]
Victory!

Id: [0x002CD716]
Ha! I'm shtill thirsty!

Id: [0x002CD717]
Ha! Guess you're good for (hic) something after all.

Id: [0x002CD718]
Not as (hic) slow as you look.

Id: [0x002CD719]
I'll (hic) get you next time.

Id: [0x002CD71B]
Haaaa (hic)!

Id: [0x002CD722]
Can you believe it, Eivor? I have never seen a ship loaded so fast.

Id: [0x002CD723]
You never had me helping you like this.

Id: [0x002CD724]
"It is an ill fate to be dependent on the feelings of your fellow man."

I need just one more.

Id: [0x002CD72C]
I need just one more.

Id: [0x002CD72D]
There. That's enough.

Id: [0x002CD72E]
There. That's enough.

Id: [0x002CD735]
Psst. Psst! Hey!

Id: [0x002CD739]
I will sell you to Hel herself!

Id: [0x002CD73D]
I like my version better.

Id: [0x002CD73E]
I like my version better.

Id: [0x002CD744]
Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord,<LF>and let perpetual light shine upon them.<LF>May all these souls rest in peace.

Id: [0x002CD746]
And it was then that I made a vow. I vowed to never turn my back on he who was there for me when God was not.

Id: [0x002CD7A8]
She even made him live with Trygve for a few moons. No one is safe from their wives, Eivor. Not even jarls and kings!

Id: [0x002CD7A9]
Still, I may not have known her in life, Eivor, but I know she lives inside these veins.

Id: [0x002CD7BD]
Hjorr has been managing Jorvik's money shortage, yet we find silver aplenty on his desk. The same desk concealing the wine.

Id: [0x002CD7E0]
This air reminds me of the time I desperately yearned for a warm bath in Norway.

Id: [0x002CD7E1]
So much so, that I listened to that weaseling, child of Loki, Toothless Wayna.

Id: [0x002CD7E4]
He said he knew of a lake, where the water always bubbled warm. "Lies!" I thought, and I dared him to prove it to me.

Id: [0x002CD7E5]
So off we went. And he was right. It was a small pool, a puddle even. But bubble it did. "Take a bath!" he said.

Id: [0x002CD7E6]
I saw no reason not to, so I disrobed. As I had my pants around my ankles, there came a mighty roar! Jormungandr's, I feared!

Id: [0x002CD7E7]
Heroes aplenty, warriors so many, but most walk about with heads that are empty![music sfx]

Id: [0x002CD7E9]
And the next thing I knew, a great jet of hot water exploded into the air. A fucking geyser!

Id: [0x002CD7EA]
It knocked me flat on my naked arse. Wayna stood laughing … but not for long. It was that day he earned the name Toothless.

Id: [0x002CD7ED]
Does not the rite demand the leader?

Cynon may be ill and aged, but his sword arm is strong. He'll kill you first if you let him. [beat]Do not let him.

Now comes Eivor of the Ravens, with the sun for eyes, trailing a river of blood, enough to paint the skies!

Id: [0x002CD81F]
For the one blessing, and the one curse, is to meet the Wolf-Kissed![ending]

Id: [0x002CD821]
Always second, never the first. Made to do a master's bidding, a servant cursed!

Id: [0x002CD822]
Alas ends the tale of Eivor the Boar, the Cheap, the Second! Ei-ei-ei-vor! Oink!

Id: [0x002CD828]
Spirits? We will see about that.

Id: [0x002CD829]
Spirits? We will see about that.

Id: [0x002CD82D]
Just one trick and then I can show you around. Um, okay, so reach into this pouch…

Id: [0x002CD82E]
Can you show me to Cynon if I say yes?

Id: [0x002CD82F]
Can you show me to Cynon if I say yes?

Id: [0x002CD835]
It's Eivor.

Id: [0x002CD836]
It's Eivor.

Id: [0x002CD842]
Who tramples wildflowers in my wood?

Id: [0x002CD843]
I see your stained soul, murderer. You cannot hide from His eyes.

Id: [0x002CD844]
Bone and sinew, tooth and nail. People splinter apart like dead branches.

Id: [0x002CD845]
I still see their glassy stares when I sleep. I buried them all. My friends. My fellows.

Id: [0x002CD848]
Incense and blood. There is murder in the air.

Id: [0x002CD849]
Incense and blood. There is murder in the air.

Gods, there has been rank slaughter here.

This tomb has been opened. It looks like someone lives here.

Id: [0x002CD855]
Just do it.

Id: [0x002CD856]
Just do it.

Id: [0x002CD870]
Grah!

Id: [0x002CD890]
Well, well! The feeder-of-ravens returns. And not half dead.

Id: [0x002CD891]
They've been sticking their hands in coffers around the city. Targeting nobles, merchants, and anyone else they can throttle.

Id: [0x002CD892]
Let us leave Eivor to enjoy his gift in peace. Come.

Id: [0x002CD894]
Seems the Red Hand disagrees.

Id: [0x002CD895]
Seems the Red Hand disagrees.

Id: [0x002CD899]
You will forgive me for stepping away. I grow weary of those pissing contests.

Id: [0x002CD8A7]
Eivor. If you've a moment to spare…

Id: [0x002CD8A8]
Eivor. Have you seen Wallace?

Id: [0x002CD8AA]
Hej Tekla, what is brewing?

Id: [0x002CD8AB]
Hej Tekla, what is brewing?

Id: [0x002CD8AC]
Such wisdom behind young eyes. You have lived a life or two I see, friend?

Id: [0x002CD8AE]
But, isn't that the adventure? I embrace mine.

Id: [0x002CD8AF]
Many lives, and many more to go before I can rest.

Many lives, and many more to go before I can rest.

The abbess here has offered to bring the texts somewhere safe. She's been working diligently on this matter.

Will the king let me in now?

Id: [0x002CD8B6]
Will the king let me in now?

Id: [0x002CD8B8]
Eivor, my friend. It's good to see you again.

Id: [0x002CD8B9]
Hold. Who goes there?

Id: [0x002CD8BA]
If you can do all that, you can call me whatever you want.

Id: [0x002CD8BB]
You have the look of one who does well with solitude. You're alone, a wanderer. It may be you think of soldiers as war fodder, and little else.

Id: [0x002CD8BC]
Follow on, Lif. Birna and Galinn are safe at a camp we've made. Eivor … you meet us there when you're ready.

Id: [0x002CD8BD]
Follow on, Birna. Lif and Galinn are safe at a camp we've made. Eivor … you meet us there when you're ready.

Id: [0x002CD8BE]
We have a camp nearby, Galinn. I'll take you there myself. Eivor, join us when you're ready.

Id: [0x002CD8BF]
That's right. And you are Eivor, the infinite fighter. Or, forever warrior. It's a glorious name.

Id: [0x002CD8C0]
Why not? You were the keystone to this attack. You turned the tide.

Id: [0x002CD8C1]
My clan throws the best feasts, I think you'll find. You enjoy yourself?

Id: [0x002CD8C2]
I hoped you might lend me your wits. You are a fresh ally. I could use your eyes and ears.

Id: [0x002CD8C3]
Thank you. Feel free to take a look around as you wish. Search the city, the tunnel.

Id: [0x002CD8C4]
That we did. You've proven yourself an asset to us. I'll see you back in Grantebridge.

Id: [0x002CD8C5]
Eivor, my muscle-banded friend! There's a nest of Wigmund's men just here. We're going to pick it clean.

Id: [0x002CD8C6]
You've made more noise than Ragnarok's end, and these Saxons still don't see you.

Id: [0x002CD8C7]
On your own? Must be quite a story. Let's see how they've recovered since you left.

Id: [0x002CD8C8]
Your instinct must be strong if you're so quick to choose. So who is the traitor?

Id: [0x002CD8C9]
This will be the hardest thing I have ever done. Stay close by me Eivor. I will need you.

Id: [0x002CD8CA]
Are you certain?

Id: [0x002CD8CB]
Of course. Feel free to search the shire for clues. And speak to anyone you wish.

Id: [0x002CD8CC]
I hope that's enough for you, Eivor, because we're finished here.

Id: [0x002CD8CD]
You're back again, Sunbeam?

Id: [0x002CD8CE]
You pick at me like a scab. And I won't have it. Be happy I don't strike you down for adding a sour note to my battle song.

Id: [0x002CD8CF]
Keep searching for lies and you will be cursed for it. Now go.

Id: [0x002CD8D0]
Stop the heathen! Raider! Vikingr! Stop him!

Id: [0x002CD8D1]
Eivor, you've been a guiding light. Calling out Galinn like that, exposing his treachery, made me sick with a quiet terror.

Id: [0x002CD8D2]
Thank you for standing at my side in this. You have my oath and my arm in the battles to come, Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002CD8D3]
Thank you, friend. You're always welcome at my hall.

Id: [0x002CD8D4]
Well met, Eivor Raven-Friend.

Id: [0x002CD8D5]
From the tales I hear, I feared you might be taller.

Id: [0x002CD8D6]
Just the way he likes it. Welcome to Eurvicscire, friend.

Id: [0x002CD8D7]
Among whom you count yourself, I suppose.

Id: [0x002CD8D8]
Swift and strong you may be. It's the one most righteous who wins the fight.

Id: [0x002CD8D9]
And you are the Hero of Jorvik, so sing my skalds.

Id: [0x002CD8DA]
I don't regret sending Faravid to lead our strike against the Picts … in spite of Eivor winning the day.

Id: [0x002CD8DB]
There's wisdom in this one, Faravid.

Id: [0x002CD8DC]
Ah, Eivor my friend. Is Donecaestre hospitality to your liking?

Id: [0x002CD8DD]
I'd be careful calling this one friend, Faravid. The crow who comes flapping when Halfdan gives a whistle.

Id: [0x002CD8DE]
Halfdan didn't send you north to fight a skirmish we could win with half our numbers. Why are you here, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CD8E0]
Sorry, friend, but that's Halfdan's take. You understand.

Id: [0x002CD8E1]
There's nothing wrong with it, friend.

Id: [0x002CD8E2]
If you tell him, he'll demand we forswear our attack. Are you willing to risk a victory like that? Our glory?

Id: [0x002CD8E3]
When you're ready, find me near Jorvik at a place called The Wolds.

Id: [0x002CD8E4]
Who died and made you sovereign of Northumbria now?

Id: [0x002CD8E5]
Up your arse, Odin-fucker!

Id: [0x002CD8E6]
The Raven-Feeder returns!

Id: [0x002CD8E7]
Eivor! Welcome, join me in drowning this golden drink.

Id: [0x002CD8E8]
Eivor, my friend. If I described my full strategy, we might never leave the campfire.

Id: [0x002CD8E9]
What's keeping you, friend Eivor? Waiting for spring?

Id: [0x002CD8EA]
Fascinating. You boast loyalty yet keep secrets from your master.

Id: [0x002CD8EB]
My new ally is more loyal than my old friend.

Id: [0x002CD8EC]
Raven-Tamer, with me. You'll talk them into a surrender with your sword-sharp tongue.

Id: [0x002CD8ED]
Faithful counselor. Please, help me back to Jorvik. Let my heart expire at home.

Id: [0x002CD8EE]
Eivor, welcome. Halfdan has stepped outside with Faravid. They shouldn't be far.

Id: [0x002CD8EF]
Of course, of course. Return when you've had your fill.

Id: [0x002CD8F0]
You are fearfully quiet, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CD8F1]
I hope one day we may raise our spears together, old friend.

Id: [0x002CD8F2]
Of course not. I'm grateful that you have come.

Id: [0x002CD8F3]
Abbot Cynebert. This is the Norse I spoke of.

Id: [0x002CD8F4]
The hot-tempered one stirs up strife, Basim! Will this rebellion-caked Dane do what I ask?

Id: [0x002CD8F5]
This Norse is one who knows the value of silence and secrecy. The perfect choice for our subtle business.

Id: [0x002CD8F6]
Does this not delight you, Eivor? A chance to defy Aelfred?

Id: [0x002CD8F7]
Stay away from me, stranger.

Id: [0x002CD8F8]
You're not welcome here.

Id: [0x002CD8F9]
Who are you? Loitering and lollygagging?

Id: [0x002CD8FA]
Now that I respect! Forceful, to the point, as refreshing as a summer ale.

Id: [0x002CD8FB]
A Dane, saints preserve me!

Id: [0x002CD8FC]
Help me! This Dane has murder in mind!

Id: [0x002CD8FD]
A Dane, eh? Alright, pond scum, you'll deal with us now.

Id: [0x002CD8FE]
Gowan the dandelion, for the seeds of my stories flit upon the winds of Wessex! But why, mule, do you kick my noggin?

Id: [0x002CD901]
You travel in strange company, lord. An Arab and … a Dane?

Id: [0x002CD902]
We owe you our lives, friend. These Saxon whoresons would have killed us all.

Id: [0x002CD903]
Aye, Raven-Tamer.

Id: [0x002CD904]
When the chance arrived to lodge an axe in the sod of Wessex, you thought of me! Such an honor.

Id: [0x002CD905]
Are you ready, Eivor? Your allies stand firm. We await your final order.

Id: [0x002CD906]
Kill me, and all of Wessex will rise against you!

Id: [0x002CD907]
Stay quiet or I'll not be able to stop my friend from slitting your throat.

Id: [0x002CD908]
Steel yourself Eivor. Or Sigurd is lost to us.

Id: [0x002CD909]
Do not stray far, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CD90A]
Nor will I, my friend.

Id: [0x002CD90B]
Whatever we find there, keep your head.

Id: [0x002CD90C]
Have a care, Eivor. You will play into her hands.

Id: [0x002CD90D]
We will not fail again, Eivor. I'll scout ahead, and send word to the settlement when I know more of Portcestre. Be ready.

Id: [0x002CD90E]
I will endeavor to do my best. And I owe this second chance to you. You did not need to trust me.

Id: [0x002CD90F]
The fellas the soldiers came after? If I were you, friend, I'd keep mum about them.

Id: [0x002CD910]
You're not welcome here. I've had enough trouble with Danes today.

Id: [0x002CD911]
You heathenish, fork-tongued Dane. Foul-smelling heap, I shit on you all!

Id: [0x002CD912]
Geadric, this is Eivor. My stone-armed sibling.

Id: [0x002CD913]
Friend, get me out of here before they have my head.

Id: [0x002CD914]
A rebel!

Id: [0x002CD915]
I owe you my life, friend.

Id: [0x002CD916]
You pulled our asses out of the fire, friend. We're grateful to you.

Id: [0x002CD917]
Caught 'em by the balls, we did! Well done, wayfarer, couldn't've done it without you.

Id: [0x002CD918]
Because you knew I would never lead you into folly. Never wager our lives before I knew the cost.

Id: [0x002CD919]
A Dane who gives alms to the righteous. I … I bless you, and pray for your wayward soul. Take this key.

Id: [0x002CD91A]
You came because I called you, Eivor. They spoke through me.

Id: [0x002CD91B]
You are my deliverer. I will await your return.

Id: [0x002CD91C]
Are you now prepared to see the stone?

Id: [0x002CD91D]
Eivor! Are you mad?

Id: [0x002CD91E]
Eivor … you muck-minded fool!

Id: [0x002CD91F]
You are not always to be trusted. Your passions overcome you. I know that. My father knew that.

Id: [0x002CD920]
You think too much of yourself, Eivor. You do not have the wisdom of Odin. Come, Basim.

Id: [0x002CD921]
You stinking Dane.

Id: [0x002CD922]
Heed your visions, always. You may have been touched by true knowledge.

Id: [0x002CD923]
Eivor. Are you ready to begin the assault, now?

Id: [0x002CD924]
Fight me yourself, coward.

Id: [0x002CD925]
Foolish Dane! I will send you to your sad supper in Valhalla.

Id: [0x002CD926]
Eivor bested you. It's for Eivor to decide your fate.

Id: [0x002CD932]
You honor her. And believe me, I have tried. But she is stubborn. Insists on looking after this old and frail hound.

Id: [0x002CD935]
In my youth, I could. [about Stikla]Both of us could. We would not think twice about taking back what is ours.

Id: [0x002CD936]
You! That was flawless. You fought with fervor! The likes of which I have not seen since Stikla here was a young raider herself.

Id: [0x002CD93F]
They fight like children!

Id: [0x002CD940]
I have longed for this!

Id: [0x002CD942]
All this blood! The waters will run red!

Id: [0x002CD948]
Near Peterborough. It's where he buys his tanning liquids. I know he sometimes makes camp at a crossroads between here and there.

Id: [0x002CD94B]
We should go now. Do you know where to start?

Id: [0x002CD94C]
We should go now. Do you know where to start?

Id: [0x002CD951]
I am busy just now, but I will return soon.

Id: [0x002CD952]
I am busy just now, but I will return soon.

Id: [0x002CD954]
It's my brother. Wallace was meant to return hours ago, but I've seen neither hide nor hair of him. He's usually punctual.

Id: [0x002CD955]
I'd like to search the woods for him, but alone I fear I'd have little luck. Would you join me? Two could cover much more ground.

Id: [0x002CD958]
Petra, what is wrong?

Id: [0x002CD959]
Petra, what is wrong?

Id: [0x002CD95C]
Still no sign of Wallace. Do you have time to look for him?

Id: [0x002CDA32]
Not for long.

Id: [0x002CDA33]
Not for long.

Id: [0x002CDA35]
Hm... a key perhaps. The markings... odd.

Id: [0x002CDA36]
This matches the markings of that sword chamber.

Id: [0x002CDA37]
What... is this place?

Id: [0x002CDA38]
Another strangely marked artefact...

Id: [0x002CDA39]
So odd... what are they for?

Id: [0x002CDA3A]
One more... they must serve some purpose.

Id: [0x002CDA3B]
One step closer to the sword...

Id: [0x002CDA3C]
Another key... I will have that blade.

Id: [0x002CDA3D]
The sword... it calls to me.

Id: [0x002CDA3E]
What suprises await me this time?

Id: [0x002CDA3F]
Another puzzle? Hmm.

Id: [0x002CDA40]
And... they've left me a challenge.

Id: [0x002CDA41]
One more enigma to unravel.

Id: [0x002CDA42]
Lets see what lies in store.

Id: [0x002CDA74]
This matches the markings of that sword chamber.

Id: [0x002CDA76]
Huh... a key perhaps. The markings... odd.

Id: [0x002CDA78]
One step closer to the sword...

Id: [0x002CDA79]
Another key... I will have that blade.

Id: [0x002CDA7A]
The sword... it calls to me.

Id: [0x002CDA7C]
Another strangely marked artefact...

Id: [0x002CDA7D]
So odd... what are they for?

Id: [0x002CDA7E]
One more... they must serve some purpose.

Id: [0x002CDA80]
What... is this place?

Id: [0x002CDA82]
What suprises await me this time?

Id: [0x002CDA83]
Another puzzle? Hmm.

Id: [0x002CDA84]
And... they've left me a challenge.

Id: [0x002CDA85]
One more enigma to unravel.

Id: [0x002CDA86]
Lets see what lies in store.

Id: [0x002CDA8B]
You are all subject to King Harald's truce. Break his peace and you will be cast out of Alrekstad.

Id: [0x002CDA90]
Keep crowing, Eivor. You only make yourself an easier target.

Id: [0x002CDA92]
I will give you no trouble.

Id: [0x002CDA93]
I will give you no trouble.

Id: [0x002CDA94]
You were shat into this world without honor, Gorm. And you will leave as a turd dumped into Hel's deepest ditch.

Id: [0x002CDA95]
You were shat into this world without honor, Gorm. And you will leave as a turd dumped into Hel's deepest ditch.

Id: [0x002CDA97]
So slow.

Id: [0x002CDA98]
You going to start?

Id: [0x002CDA99]
You're sweating!

Id: [0x002CDA9A]
You're a bit green friend...

Id: [0x002CDA9B]
Ha! Drool-monger!

Id: [0x002CDA9C]
Got some on your boots...

Id: [0x002CDA9D]
Don't hurl into the barrel, ok?

Id: [0x002CDA9E]
Be kissing a flagstone soon.

Id: [0x002CDA9F]
Too strong for you?

Id: [0x002CDAA0]
Staggering already?

Id: [0x002CDAA5]
I'll kill him!

Id: [0x002CDAAA]
That doesn't calm me. I wanted to rip the bastard's spine out myself. You want to calm me? Start talking.

Id: [0x002CDAAC]
Audun aligned himself to a secret group that was plotting to overtake Jorvik.

Id: [0x002CDAAD]
Audun aligned himself to a secret group that was plotting to overtake Jorvik.

Id: [0x002CDAB0]
What have we become? Reduced to animals.

Id: [0x002CDAB5]
O, my goodness. Our estate is aflame!

Id: [0x002CDAB6]
All they do is squabble! I remember a time when the barley brought us joy. We praised it, smelled it, rubbed it against our bellies!

Id: [0x002CDAB7]
Begone with all of it! It has only torn us apart!

Id: [0x002CDAC8]
I wish our parents would get along like they used to … before, when there was no silo, and we all shared the barley.

Id: [0x002CDAC9]
Seems silly to think who gets more or what. We have enough. They just fight like dogs. Dogs who forgot why they're even barking in the first place!

Id: [0x002CDACA]
This is for the best. Our fathers would fight forever otherwise.

Id: [0x002CDACB]
Our parents kept a happy way. Perhaps this will reset the balance, and they won't be blinded by profit and ego.

Id: [0x002CDAD4]
I've never been in such a fight, you walloped me with all your might.

Id: [0x002CDAD5]
It seems to me you've proven to be champion of the BBB.

Id: [0x002CDAD7]
Watching you rub bodies was an absolute treat. You move just like a noodle, my favorite thing to eat.

Id: [0x002CDAD8]
It would please me to no end to watch you fight again. So whenever, now, or then, return promptly to my den.

Id: [0x002CDAD9]
You answered the midnight call and you took a towering fall. But return to me again if you dare re-enter this den.

Id: [0x002CDADA]
I am honored, I think.

Id: [0x002CDADB]
I am honored, I think.

Id: [0x002CDAEC]
Eivor, did you hear? The king will visit tomorrow. Sigurd will be with him.

Id: [0x002CDB66]
Over there. He may have stayed somewhere nearby.

Id: [0x002CDB67]
Over there. He may have stayed somewhere nearby.

Id: [0x002CDB6A]
A set of tools. If they belonged to Wallace, why would he take them from his satchel here?

Id: [0x002CDB6B]
A set of tools. If they belonged to Wallace, why would he take them from his satchel here?

Id: [0x002CDB6D]
What are you doing! Get out of my house!

Id: [0x002CDB6F]
The day is new, and the air is bracing. Are you ready for the fight ahead?

Id: [0x002CDB70]
You've been thorough…[breath, braces self] Who is the traitor?

Id: [0x002CDB71]
You owe me your life, old friend. Once again.

Id: [0x002CDB72]
Here, Dane. Try your luck at throwing bones.

Id: [0x002CDB73]
Not just any hero. Eivor brought order to the city when King Ricsige could not.

Id: [0x002CDB74]
I defer to your expertise. Hacking, hewing, and the like. Enjoy the feast, counselor.

Id: [0x002CDB75]
This is our fight, our chance for glory. Fly on home, crow.

Id: [0x002CDB76]
Ah, the Wolf-Kissed is a reader. That's dark seidr (magic) I'll never mess with.

Id: [0x002CDB77]
Fuck Halfdan. If the Raven wants wine, the Raven gets wine. Open it, Faravid.

Id: [0x002CDB78]
Why all these doubts, Eivor? You're a warrior, not a rumormonger.

Id: [0x002CDB79]
Stand back, Dane. There's a witch within that house. We've come to burn it down.

Id: [0x002CDB7A]
Pfft. We're not moving, heathen. We're watching you!

Id: [0x002CDB7B]
Quite the charmer, you are. But you jest. We all know in whom the true power lies.

Id: [0x002CDB7C]
I lived, I died, and now I sleep. And in my sleep, I dream. And in my dreams, I see an end to the doom that will grip the earth once again. Find the Wolf-Kissed, find the Mad One, find me, and save us all from another death.

Id: [0x002CDB7D]
We are deep in their god's heartland, a heathen and a heretic. To hunt Fulke, we'll need a Christian snare.

Id: [0x002CDB7E]
Ah! Your wolf shows its teeth, Basim.

Id: [0x002CDB7F]
O, la-di-da. Listen to you all high and mighty. Get away with you, yer valley-lily.

Id: [0x002CDB80]
Flee, my friend. We have the man we came for. Does this venture not set your blood ablaze?

Id: [0x002CDB81]
Because you are wise, and you see the same qualities in me.

Id: [0x002CDB82]
I'll cut you down, Dane.

Id: [0x002CDB83]
You will die for the indignities you have showered upon me, Dane!

Id: [0x002CDB84]
I guard you like a father. Nothing is served with your brutal end. You have much to do in this life, I know it.

Id: [0x002CDB85]
Look, Dane, you start a scene or a scuffle and I'll scream for soldiers.

Id: [0x002CDB86]
When you're ready for war, you'll find me at a camp near Cyne Belle Castle.

Id: [0x002CDB87]
By my joints and ankles, you're a tough one.

Id: [0x002CDB88]
By Jesus, you're a better customer than your needling partner.

Id: [0x002CDB89]
That's an odd bargain, Dane, but I'll bite. Sing me one of your sagas.

Id: [0x002CDB8B]
No riddles. I sense a greatness within you both. Your destiny is not to stain the stones of this God-house with your blood.

Id: [0x002CDB8F]
It's you. Wh-what are you doing in Mercia?

Id: [0x002CDB93]
Right. Well … take what you need and get going.

Id: [0x002CDB95]
That should cover it. Thank you kindly.

Id: [0x002CDB99]
Said you had settled in the center of Mercia, taking in whatever flotsam, jetsam, and jumble of misfits came to your docks.

Id: [0x002CDB9B]
More than anything. Always been a bit of a drifter. The thought of settling in a rowdy camp felt like a good balance.

Id: [0x002CDB9C]
And this appealed to you?

Id: [0x002CDB9D]
And this appealed to you?

Id: [0x002CDBA2]
Did he? Well … could be he knows somebody who looks like me. There's no shortage of big bearded men around here, yeah?

Id: [0x002CDBA6]
I suppose not.

Id: [0x002CDBA7]
I suppose not.

Id: [0x002CDBA8]
You too, Eivor. Thank you for your help.

Id: [0x002CDBBE]
I cannot help now. Maybe later?

Id: [0x002CDBBF]
I cannot help now. Maybe later?

Id: [0x002CDBC1]
I can lend a hand.

Id: [0x002CDBC2]
I can lend a hand.

Id: [0x002CDBC7]
I did not take you for a baker when we met. You have the look of someone who swings an axe.

Id: [0x002CDBC8]
I did not take you for a baker when we met. You have the look of someone who swings an axe.

Id: [0x002CDBCC]
And being a baker, I knew my services would not be sniffed at.

Id: [0x002CDBCD]
I do hear that a lot.

Id: [0x002CDBCF]
I have always enjoyed it. And I have always been good at it.

Id: [0x002CDBD0]
But baking is your only craft. Is that right?

Id: [0x002CDBD1]
But baking is your only craft. Is that right?

Id: [0x002CDBD2]
But when I am not able to find such work, I take odd jobs where I can. So long as I can work with my hands.

Id: [0x002CDBD4]
Well, we have that in common.

Id: [0x002CDBD5]
Well, we have that in common.

Id: [0x002CDBD7]
A question, Eivor. You are a warrior, a fighter, that much I know. But if you could stop fighting, what would you do?

Id: [0x002CDBDC]
You ask the wrong question. I can stop fighting. But to do so would be to deny the essence of who I am.

Id: [0x002CDBDD]
You ask the wrong question. I can stop fighting. But to do so would be to deny the essence of who I am.

Id: [0x002CDBDF]
No, you've given me the answer I wanted. It's good you have found what calls you. A rare and happy thing.

Id: [0x002CDBE0]
I think you mean … "If I had to stop fighting, what would I become?"

Id: [0x002CDBE1]
I think you mean … "If I had to stop fighting, what would I become?"

Id: [0x002CDBE5]
It is my calling to feed people, I'd say. To be of service to those I care for, and who care for me. That brings me joy.

Id: [0x002CDBE7]
I don't know that it's noble. It's simply what gets me up in the morning. And gives me purpose for the rest of my day.

Id: [0x002CDBE8]
About your question earlier, what would I do if I weren't a warrior? I would ask the same of you. Is baking bread your greatest wish?

Id: [0x002CDBE9]
About your question earlier, what would I do if I weren't a warrior? I would ask the same of you. Is baking bread your greatest wish?

Id: [0x002CDBEC]
Put that way, it is a noble pursuit.

Id: [0x002CDBED]
Put that way, it is a noble pursuit.

Id: [0x002CDBEF]
There is nothing to forgive. You walked away. They pursued. By axe or by fist, I will do what must be done to protect my clan.

Id: [0x002CDBF0]
There is nothing to forgive. You walked away. They pursued. By axe or by fist, I will do what must be done to protect my clan.

Id: [0x002CDBF3]
You are living the life you want, aren't you?

Id: [0x002CDBFC]
Yes, he's a clever one, and rather kind when you meet him. Makes you feel like you're a friend. Family, even.

Id: [0x002CDBFF]
I met him a decade ago and he was the first person to truly welcome me. To see some value in me.

Id: [0x002CDC00]
He told me I had a gift. For intimidation, persuasion … violence. Just by the size and strength of me, he knew how to use me.

Id: [0x002CDC11]
Wilf and them were the only family I had then. But their love was … conditional. Wilf only loves what he owns.

Id: [0x002CDC14]
I know I won't go back. I don't want more blood on my hands. But apart from that, it's hard to say. Who knows what they have in mind?

Id: [0x002CDC16]
So what do you intend?

Id: [0x002CDC17]
So what do you intend?

Id: [0x002CDC1D]
Guthban, my boy! As I live and breathe, you got my message! And you've brought a friend.

Id: [0x002CDC20]
Who might you be, Dane? His new leash?

Id: [0x002CDC22]
I know, I know. I'm busted up about it. But tell … Tekla, was it? Tell her that her ale is some of the finest we've tasted.

Id: [0x002CDC24]
I am done with you, Wilf.

Id: [0x002CDC25]
I am Eivor. And the woman you robbed was one of my clan. That will not stand.

Id: [0x002CDC26]
I am Eivor. And the woman you robbed was one of my clan. That will not stand.

Id: [0x002CDC2B]
But we are not done with you, boy. We gave you food, shelter, ale to drink, riches galore. We made you who you are.

Id: [0x002CDC2D]
You're a fiery one. I like that. But the ink was dried on this deal well before your number arrived in England.

Id: [0x002CDC2E]
If you wish to clear Tarben's name, I'm happy to help with that. It's only a small matter of cost…

Id: [0x002CDC35]
For all you did for him, he repaid you with blood and sweat, did he not?

Id: [0x002CDC36]
For all you did for him, he repaid you with blood and sweat, did he not?

Id: [0x002CDC41]
If you're keen, you could recover my belongings and return them to me. Do that, and your name is clear.

Id: [0x002CDC42]
I … I can't. I promised myself I would leave all this behind, but…

Id: [0x002CDC79]
The ledger…

Id: [0x002CDC7B]
Of course. Happy to honor it, my goodness! Such a lack of trust these days. It's a dark age, no mistake.

Id: [0x002CDC7F]
That's it then. We're done?

Id: [0x002CDC80]
Aye. You are free to walk from this place and live as Tarben the Boring Bread Maker for the rest of your days.

Id: [0x002CDC81]
But you, Eivor. If you ever get tired of the settled life … we could always use a thief with your skills. Think about it.

Id: [0x002CDC95]
No vow stands above my duty to my friends, Eivor. I could not leave you alone with them should they attack.

Id: [0x002CDC96]
But I am. Now listen. When we reach the camp, leave everything to me. I will find Wilf's goods and bring them to you.

Id: [0x002CDC97]
But I am. Now listen. When we reach the camp, leave everything to me. I will find Wilf's goods and bring them to you.

Id: [0x002CDC9A]

A quick robbery like this? That was the least of our work. We stole from the poor, killed the helpless, cheated the dimwitted.

Id: [0x002CDCA5]
Let it go then. Remember only what makes you a better man.

A grain merchant has set up downriver. I want to bring a half dozen bags home, but I would need an extra pair of hands.

Id: [0x002CDCC8]
The biggest one pulled me off my horse and stuck his mouth in my ear. Said "Tell Guthban we expected him home soon."

Id: [0x002CDCCC]
Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CDCCD]
Guthban? That's "Battle Bone" in the Saxon tongue. Are you sure?

Id: [0x002CDCCE]
Guthban? That's "Battle Bone" in the Saxon tongue. Are you sure?

Guthban? Hm. Nothing comes to mind. Should I?

Id: [0x002CDCD2]
Ah. Is it a horse?

Id: [0x002CDCD4]
A lover?

Id: [0x002CDCD6]
I am well, Rowan. I had only a small question. Do you know anyone named Guthban?

Id: [0x002CDCD7]

No, it's--

No, Rowan. It's … it's no one.

No, Rowan. It's … it's no one.

Thank you for your time.

So you came to me? Why would you come to me about a false name? Do you think my name is false?

Id: [0x002CDCE3]
I am Octavian, I have always been Octavian. Now please, Eivor, this is not a good time for me. I am terribly busy. Good day.

Id: [0x002CDCE5]
It is a name, I think. But no face comes to mind. I fear it may be a moniker. A false name.

Not one who bakes bread, no. So how did you earn this name?

I swore never to spill another drop of blood. To abandon acts of violence. To never kill again.

Id: [0x002CDD01]
It wasn't. Not for me. This life here is all I've ever wanted. I've never been more at peace.

Id: [0x002CDD02]
A hard promise for a hard man.

Id: [0x002CDD03]

Stop! Not a step closer!

Id: [0x002CDD1A]
Y-you're right. I cannot hold on any longer to what is already lost. I will go.

Id: [0x002CDD1B]
Here, a key if you want to check on the sick, yourself. If I'm to leave, I can't face them again.

Id: [0x002CDD21]
I cannot abandon my family. I will do what I can, else what is my life's path?

Id: [0x002CDD25]
I see you have eluded the grasp of death.

Id: [0x002CDD26]

It is you, Dane! The one from the village. Aye, God saw it fit to spare me their fate. I repay his glory now, healing those here.

Id: [0x002CDD2B]
Take care.

Burk, the man I work for. He did this to me, that evil man!

I was simply doing a round of checks on our last shipment when he accused me of theft! Me! Theft!

Hurrey ran off with it. Don't hurt us! We didn't mean anything! Please.

Have no doubt, He Who Walks Backwards is among us. Either he will come out of there, or we will go in.

Id: [0x002CDE46]
It's kind of you to ask, but with so much blood in the water and death on the air, I'd know your name and purpose first.

Id: [0x002CDE48]
Likewise, Eivor. Thanks again for plucking me and my warriors from the mire.

Id: [0x002CDE49]
I like you, Eivor. You may help me here or step on me, and by the look of you, I'd welcome either.

Id: [0x002CDE4B]
I need clear, sound judgment. I need you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CDE4C]
And here, a gift, for retaking Grantebridge with us. One of the few things I have left from my blood family.

Id: [0x002CDE4D]
You stamped and roared like fiery Surtr himself, marching through the flames of Muspelheim. I'll see you back home, drengr (courageous warrior).

Id: [0x002CDE4E]
But I won't face him while the traitor he commands is still under my roof. So what have you learned?

Id: [0x002CDE4F]
Did you find enough clues around Grantebridgescire? Are you ready to choose the traitor?

Id: [0x002CDE50]
You … you told me you found yellow paint on Galinn's longboat, didn't you?

Id: [0x002CDE51]
Well, you're not the regular Sunbeam I've come to know. Something weighing on you?

Id: [0x002CDE52]
You saw me near death in the fens, clinging to this life, and still you question me?

Id: [0x002CDE53]
I was alone that night. And until Saxons appeared, I didn't see anything out of the ordinary. I hope that's enough.

Id: [0x002CDE54]
Eivor. You're still with me through all this. Do not think I'll forget.

Id: [0x002CDE55]
You're right, I know you're right. It's just … it's difficult to see that end when you're still in the storm's eye.

Id: [0x002CDE57]
Don't undercut your own ferocity, drengr. It was your blade leading the charge! You are indeed something to behold.

Id: [0x002CDE5A]
You slew my brother and never said a word. You kept this from me!

Id: [0x002CDE5B]
Eivor, yes. Down in Mercia. Kingmaker with my brothers Ivarr and Ubba. And Finnr in East Anglia.

Id: [0x002CDE5C]
So you answered my summons. But the timing is poor as you can see. Too many here are spent … battle-sore … thirsty.

Id: [0x002CDE5D]
They say you rooted out a gang of thieves and traitors.

Id: [0x002CDE5E]
You gifted my silver to the karls and ceorls of Jorvik.

Id: [0x002CDE5F]
Eivor and I felled them, Halfdan Jarl, so you could sweep in, stab a few cold corpses, and claim a glorious victory.

Id: [0x002CDE60]
Small men always talk big. So, was Halfdan generous? Did you get what you came for?

Id: [0x002CDE61]
You never gave it.

Id: [0x002CDE62]
Worry about the Picts later. Now's the time for treasure and spoils. You earned it.

Id: [0x002CDE63]
You're stalling, Eivor. Tell me what you've learned. What news from the North?

Id: [0x002CDE64]
You spoke with Moira. What did you learn?

Id: [0x002CDE65]
Eivor Two-Faced. That's your name.

Id: [0x002CDE66]
Have you had enough fun? My crowning must come soon.

Id: [0x002CDE67]
To Eivor and the Raven Clan of Mercia, our newest ally, in blood and glory!

Id: [0x002CDE69]
I'll send you to your heathen hell!

Id: [0x002CDE6D]
That's it! Eivor raised the portcullis! Come men, surge on, surge on.

Id: [0x002CDE6E]
You dare to take this fortress, Dane? Aelfred's army will smear your innards across the battlements.

Id: [0x002CDE6F]
This is why you batter down my gates, kill my men, for a purse of grubby coin? You have no honor!

Id: [0x002CDE70]
It's you! You threatened our Mae!

Id: [0x002CDE71]
Half the soldiers of the shire are hunting us. You must have noticed.

Id: [0x002CDE73]
You can speak with him in my stead. But we must hurry. Fulke's life may be in danger.

Id: [0x002CDE74]
Did you find your brother, then?

Id: [0x002CDE75]
Eivor. There was a time when you would follow me without question, because we trusted one another.

Id: [0x002CDE76]
Is there something that holds you back from embracing me as you once did? As your brother? Your family.

Id: [0x002CDE77]
When you raided Saint Albanes, are you sure you saw nothing? No crypt? No prisoners?

Id: [0x002CDE7A]
You. Always questioning, second guessing my wishes. You slowed us down and I missed my chance!

Id: [0x002CDE7B]
If it wasn't clear why Sigurd is in command, it is now. Your temper runs too hot, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002CDE7C]
Eivor. Have you dealt Eadwyn a few bruising blows?

Id: [0x002CDE7D]
You're a good man, Sigurd. And I'm thankful for all you've done. But without Eivor, I make no moves. We wait.

Id: [0x002CDE7E]
And have you laid poles of hazel and composed your poems for the coming victory?

Id: [0x002CDE7F]
Aye, you've done us well, Eivor. I thank ye. And if ever you need the like, I'll do what I can.

Id: [0x002CDE82]
Come out of there and face God's justice, Devil!

Id: [0x002CDE83]
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo.

Id: [0x002CDE88]
No more will fall prey to the beasts you command.

Id: [0x002CDE89]
No more will fall prey to the beasts you command.

God be praised! Then we can go home at last. Take this as a sign of our gratitude.

Your devil is slain.

Id: [0x002CDE98]
So here is the devil.

Id: [0x002CDE99]
Quite well! It's been odd not having Birna around to keep my pride in check. How is she since she joined you?

Id: [0x002CDE9A]
We handled it just fine. Thinking of starting a new town, in fact. This house being our first.

Id: [0x002CDE9B]
No. He'll be gone, count on it. Argr (weak) coward. But we've struck a bold claim today.

Id: [0x002CDE9D]
You brew up stories better than anything I've tasted in any meadhall, Eivor! I don't have time for this insolence.

Id: [0x002CDE9E]
He means to erase me! To banish me from your minds! Fight in my name! Die for me! Die for me!

Id: [0x002CDE9F]
Thank you for your tribute, Eivor Wolf-Kissed. Your battles and deeds are well known to me.

Id: [0x002CDEA0]
O, you're a fancy one! Sitting up in Halfdan's tower!

Id: [0x002CDEA1]
You've grown awfully silent, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002CDEA2]
Wolf-Kissed and Halfdan, well met! Come, fill your bellies with mead.

Id: [0x002CDEA3]
Eivor the Wolf-Kissed. And Halfdan's cup-bearer. What a curious surprise.

Id: [0x002CDEA4]
Loyal to the bone, aren't you?

Id: [0x002CDEA5]
There are things simmering in Northumbria, hidden from even you. Take heed and have a care.

Id: [0x002CDEA6]
Hello, hero! Come on over for a drink, eh? It's a feast!

Id: [0x002CDEA7]
A wise move, mud-wit. It so happens I did see Aelfred's man. He's long gone though. Maybe Gowan the Bard knows where?

Id: [0x002CDEA8]
Now that's just hurtful. No need to dig the blade in.

Id: [0x002CDEA9]
Ah, bless you, for stories are my currency friend. How else am I to make my living?

Id: [0x002CDEAA]
My thanks, weaver of the obvious. Now leave me to my unholy punishment.

Id: [0x002CDEAB]
Yet as a leader yourself, you cannot deny that subtlety and intrigue are a cloak you must wear.

Id: [0x002CDEAC]
Are you sure that's Tedmund? He's dressed as a lord, but that man is shorter and fatter than I recall.

Id: [0x002CDEAD]
It is best to snare a wasp with honey. Have you ever considered more subtlety?

Id: [0x002CDEAE]
We could have cut you to bloody giblets, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002CDEB0]
The Lord bids me to welcome all strangers. Here, friend. Take the key. And depart with your strange friend.

Id: [0x002CDEB2]
Eivor! You rigged the defenses!

Id: [0x002CDEB3]
Spoken like the volur. It is indeed a kind of magic.

Id: [0x002CDEB4]
The words of a poet. Now let us drown ourselves in mead. For friendship.

Id: [0x002CDEB5]
Ah, yes, and quite a fearsome one at that.

Id: [0x002CDEB6]
Alright! No need for that. You paint a vivid picture, Dane. He was headed to the white coast to the southeast. Dover Fortress.

Id: [0x002CDEC2]
Have you slain him? Or has the Devil's tongue swayed you?

Id: [0x002CDEC6]
You're light on your feet and quick through the grass.

Id: [0x002CDEC7]
I don't know you. One of Faravid's new dogs?

Why would the godly shepherd ally with the heretic?

I have not seen a blade so sharp.

We're fishermen, my granddad and me, and we can help with anything you need! Bring us fish you find out there and we'll pay you for 'em!

No more fish today?

Id: [0x002CDF1C]
All done?

Id: [0x002CDF1D]
That it?

Id: [0x002CDF1E]
I have to say, Eivor...I think you've found every fish there is! Well done. You should be very proud of yourself!

Id: [0x002CDF1F]
We've been looking for this fish for a long time.

Id: [0x002CDF20]
I've heard tell that this one's a real fighter!

Id: [0x002CDF21]
I've never even seen this fish close up.

Id: [0x002CDF22]
Only a true fisherman could catch this one.

Id: [0x002CDF23]
Not even grandfather has caught one of these!

Id: [0x002CDF24]
Thanks, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CDF25]
Thanks for the fish!

Id: [0x002CDF26]
Grandfather will be excited to see this catch!

Id: [0x002CDF27]
These are good fish!

Id: [0x002CDF28]
Thanks!

Id: [0x002CDF2A]
You caught this?!

Id: [0x002CDF2B]
Look at this size of it!

Id: [0x002CDF2C]
Now this is a worthy catch!

Id: [0x002CDF2D]
Look at this fish!

Id: [0x002CDF2E]
He must have put up quite a fight!

Id: [0x002CDF2F]
Come back soon!

Id: [0x002CDF30]
Farewell, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CDF31]
Goodbye!

Id: [0x002CDF32]
Come visit again soon!

Id: [0x002CDF7D]
"Never walk away from home ahead of your axe or sword. You cannot feel a battle in your bones."

Id: [0x002CDF80]
There is nothing for me here. I must go make my name in the world.

Id: [0x002CDF83]
Well fought, Wolf-Kissed! Even if your wits were somewhat rattled.

Id: [0x002CDF84]
You do not need to tell us twice!

Id: [0x002CDF86]
Let the wind tickle my skin forever.

Id: [0x002CDF8A]
Because my uncompromising lack of clothes brings me joy. Yet my very own sect of Pious Nudists tossed me aside!

Id: [0x002CDF8D]
Indeed. We-we bare our skin at all times! In the tradition of great Greeks and Romans. Yet some say I am too … enthusiastic.

Id: [0x002CDF8F]
Nude in prayer, at mealtimes, at work. In the streets and alehouses. Everywhere! For Jesus loves us best as we were born!

Id: [0x002CDF91]
Why are you naked?

Id: [0x002CDF92]
Why are you naked?

Id: [0x002CDF99]
I lack the patience for pole fishing. I would have better luck with my bow.

Id: [0x002CDF9A]
I lack the patience for pole fishing. I would have better luck with my bow.

Id: [0x002CDF9B]
Ah, you're back.

Id: [0x002CDF9C]
O, and before you go, could you spare a moment? For a small favor.

Id: [0x002CDFA6]
A good idea. I will join you now.

Id: [0x002CDFA7]
A good idea. I will join you now.

Id: [0x002CDFA9]
I do not have the time right now. But I will return.

Id: [0x002CDFAA]
I do not have the time right now. But I will return.

Id: [0x002CDFAC]
For the past few evenings, I have heard the howling of a pack of wolves just beyond the border of our woods.

Id: [0x002CDFAF]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x002CDFB0]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x002CDFB1]
You feel we should drive them off?

Id: [0x002CDFB2]
You feel we should drive them off?

Id: [0x002CDFB3]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed, is that you?

Id: [0x002CDFC1]
The last ship I spent any good time on was my father's. Quite a lot happened on that ship. Quite a lot.

Id: [0x002CDFC5]
Hey, you! Can you swim? Our father's down there, looking for treasure.

Id: [0x002CDFC7]
My sea legs are returning to me, but there is a shadow yet in the waves that stifles my joy.

Id: [0x002CDFD1]
On our voyage from Norway, Thor's temper flared. The rain was relentless, and his fury struck the mast.

Id: [0x002CDFD3]
Hard and fast, the waves roiled and tossed the ship. Trygve hollered above the wind, trying to reel in the hysteria.

Id: [0x002CDFD4]
Father on the other hand, I had never seen him so calm. I grabbed on to him for an order, but he just looked at me and said…

Id: [0x002CDFD5]
"If our fate is death, there is no worry, just accept it. If our fate is to live, then there is no worry, stay the course."

Id: [0x002CDFD6]
I thought him mad at the time. But he was right. Those meant to survive, did. There was no fighting fate.

Id: [0x002CDFD9]
Do not worry, Runa. The warrior will find father.

Id: [0x002CDFDA]
What if you're wrong? He's been down there for hours.

Id: [0x002CDFF2]
This world is hard, and the gods care not.

Id: [0x002CDFF3]
This world is hard, and the gods care not.

Id: [0x002CDFF5]
A fishmonger can't sell week-old fish. Where's that husband of yours? Off fishing again?

Id: [0x002CDFF6]
Bah! You're better off without that wastrel.

Id: [0x002CDFFF]
The tale of Skolla should interest you. I looked for her before I left Norway. I wanted to take her with me.

Id: [0x002CE000]
But you know her. She would have no master, no shackle. It had been months since I saw her last, and I was worried.

Id: [0x002CE007]
Power is a stronger drink than mead, and an immortal is the most dangerous form of drunkard.

Id: [0x002CE020]
What is that boy doing all the way up there?

Id: [0x002CE021]
What is that boy doing all the way up there?

Id: [0x002CE023]
Your meddling has doomed us all, crow of battle.

Id: [0x002CE026]
To free a goddess, a creature of power and light…

Id: [0x002CE027]
More lies from a liar born. Now speak the truth. What brought The Order to this place?

Id: [0x002CE028]
More lies from a liar born. Now speak the truth. What brought The Order to this place?

Id: [0x002CE02A]
Holding up hope, I set myself and an elk carcass down in her house. For hours she did not show, and I eventually fell asleep.

Id: [0x002CE02D]
No! Wh-why … that sweet fool, leaving me penniless…

Id: [0x002CE031]
Then, suddenly, it was hard to breathe, and I gasped for air, waking only to find myself pinned down.

Id: [0x002CE03B]
And there she was, [beat]freshly sated with elk, sound asleep, her head on my chest. Nails ruffling my beard.

Id: [0x002CE03E]
Here, take this ring. I found it on his body. It is rightfully yours.

Id: [0x002CE03F]
Here, take this ring. I found it on his body. It is rightfully yours.

Id: [0x002CE041]
That worthless man! Even in death, he leaves me penniless! The useless pig!

Id: [0x002CE042]
The bandits made off with all that he had.

Id: [0x002CE043]
The bandits made off with all that he had.

Id: [0x002CE045]
I put my arm around her and we stole a nap like we used to. Then I woke again, [beat]and she was gone. As quietly as she came.

Id: [0x002CE046]
Ah, she was a good dog…

Id: [0x002CE04A]
Hey, who stole my coin-purse? My hefty, hefty coin-purse? [beat]O, fate despises me. [singsong]So it goes.

Id: [0x002CE04D]
These fucking farmers must have more than this.

Id: [0x002CE04E]
[guffawing]What did you expect, brother? Sword and silver? We had a bit of fun! That's what matters.

Id: [0x002CE050]
Blight is too kind a word. A seer's curse!

Id: [0x002CE051]
Rued's men are a blight on this land.

Id: [0x002CE052]
Rued's men are a blight on this land.

One who has need of their wits wanders wide … I might find good fishing below the Scarborough cliffs.

Id: [0x002CE061]
One who has need of their wits wanders wide … I might find good fishing below the Scarborough cliffs.

Id: [0x002CE067]
If I die, tell her I think only of her.

Id: [0x002CE068]
I am just screwing my courage to the sticky place.

Id: [0x002CE06A]
A sturdy craft. It will do.

Id: [0x002CE06B]
A sturdy craft. It will do.

Id: [0x002CE06E]
Stop it, you grubkin. If he falls, God will punish you.

Id: [0x002CE070]
Who are you? An admirer? Can it be true, that so soon upon my path, God has sent me adulation?

Id: [0x002CE071]
Asser, is it? How is your writing faring?

Id: [0x002CE072]
Asser, is it? How is your writing faring?

Id: [0x002CE076]
My husband should be back by now. The poor lug worries me so.

Id: [0x002CE077]
He fishes along Scarborough shore, beneath the tower ruins, does he not? That's foolish, the cliffs are too steep.

Id: [0x002CE079]
Father bet the cauldron on a foolish wager with Suttungr and lost. But we still have the ale from our brewery!

Id: [0x002CE07B]
Gone to Utgard. He sent the cauldron to Suttungr, but it never got there. So he's gone to find out what's what.

Id: [0x002CE07E]
But enough of that. You are a visitor to our great land, and we know its secrets. Ask of us your questions.

Id: [0x002CE07F]
Where is Aegir now?

Id: [0x002CE080]
Where is Aegir now?

Id: [0x002CE081]
Even if I get smashed on the ground like an … an … overripe plum…

Id: [0x002CE082]
That fisherman was asking for it. He should have paid his dues when we asked for them.

Id: [0x002CE085]
I will tell my husband, the king, you claim our daughter's hand. When you are a little older of course.

Id: [0x002CE088]
I have heard tell of a great bear of stone and ice that lives by a frozen lake.

Id: [0x002CE089]
All hail the Lord of the Saxons. Esobert the Flea!

Id: [0x002CE08C]
Marry, they said. Marriage has left me naught but a poor widow with nary a fish to sell.

Id: [0x002CE08F]
That lovesick fool … I warned him to stay away from the cliffs.

Id: [0x002CE092]
I should… I should find out what I did while ale-addled. My mind is blank.

Id: [0x002CE093]
I should… I should find out what I did while ale-addled. My mind is a blank.

Id: [0x002CE095]
I never thought I would be beaten. But you run like the wind! I am glad I had a real challenge.

Id: [0x002CE097]
Do you like interesting places? I've run all over Wessex. Found some scary, spooky, magic spots!

Id: [0x002CE098]
I'll give you my diary. I call it, The Many Wondrous Runnings of the Galloping Miracle Legs. Bye-bye!

Id: [0x002CE09C]
And I am glad to have given you one.

Id: [0x002CE09D]
And I am glad to have given you one.

Id: [0x002CE0A6]
See, I told you! Mildburg the Miracle Legs!

Id: [0x002CE0AB]
You are fast, I grant you. But you will not outrun me!

Id: [0x002CE0AC]
You are fast, I grant you. But you will not outrun me!

Id: [0x002CE0AF]
Seek a lonely tree on the shore and walk beneath it. You will see. Now let us drink to the fallen.

Id: [0x002CE0B3]
To magic! May we never be without it!

Id: [0x002CE0BB]
Hatred has driven you mad!

Id: [0x002CE0BC]
Hatred has driven you mad!

Whatever you have suffered, it was not at my hands!

How many have you murdered in this wood?

I have done you no wrong!

Id: [0x002CE0C3]
You are mind-sick!

You are mind-sick!

Id: [0x002CE0DE]
So the cake was a lie?

Id: [0x002CE0DF]
So the cakes were a lie?

Id: [0x002CE0E0]
A terrible display, friend. And now the sweet treats will go uneaten.

Id: [0x002CE0E2]
Your wit outshone my words. And such a feat deserves three cakes! But unfortunately, I do not have any.

Id: [0x002CE0E4]
A worthy effort, friend. But some meanings did not find you.

Id: [0x002CE0E5]
Not so, sadly you just do not deserve them.

Id: [0x002CE0E6]
I do not get many visitors. Your presence sparked my mind. A rare thing out here.

Id: [0x002CE0E7]
My grandfather built this turf maze.

Id: [0x002CE0E8]
I wonder, will we ever tire of such wordplay? Will the riddles of England die with me?

Id: [0x002CE0EC]
Stay a while, read some more of my scribblings.

Id: [0x002CE0F2]
God doesn't give a rat's arse about your love life.

Id: [0x002CE0F3]
Then do it for the money. I am willing to pay good coin to someone who believes in true love.

Id: [0x002CE0F4]
I will not be caught up in your womanly schemes, witch.

Id: [0x002CE0F6]
I know a few things about love.

Id: [0x002CE0F7]
I know a few things about love.

[ONO concerned/fearful shouting]

Id: [0x002CE101]
Hold the dagger into the sun! Hold it. It warms my face.

Id: [0x002CE102]
There, there it is. The sun hits my dagger and warms your face.

Id: [0x002CE103]
Ah. There must be a kenning for what we are living right now.

Id: [0x002CE104]
Oath. These rocks keep heat longer than most, like us. Keeper of Rays for Those One Loves.

Id: [0x002CE105]
Let it burn a hole right through me.

Id: [0x002CE106]
The sound of stones falling upon stones is nice. They click and clack so well.

Id: [0x002CE107]
He will be. I have watched him for many turns of the sun. And now he will know of my burning love. Thanks to you.

Id: [0x002CE108]
You watched me? That is … so…

Id: [0x002CE109]
Romantic. That you would go to such lengths, to win my heart? It touches me [low and sexy]in places I cannot speak of.

Id: [0x002CE10C]
You have my thanks, Dane. Take your reward and leave us. [beat]Plow me, soft one, scythe the weeds from my field.

Id: [0x002CE10D]
Strange and unnatural?

Id: [0x002CE10E]
Strange and unnatural?

Id: [0x002CE111]
Flowers would be nice. I miss their sunny faces. But the wolves… My waiflike waist and slim wrists are no match for them.

Id: [0x002CE113]
Well, hello there. You turned out to have quite a head for heights.

Id: [0x002CE126]
Ripe with wine and vomit. These are thrall's clothes. Where did they come from?

Id: [0x002CE127]
Ripe with wine and vomit. These are thrall's clothes. Where did they come from?

Id: [0x002CE131]
Someone stole the clothes from my washing line in the night! Never caught the thieves, but I heard them giggling like fools.

Id: [0x002CE132]
Ah. I saw one of Aegir's daughters stumbling about at dawn, wearing ripped clothes that were much too small.

Id: [0x002CE133]
I think that was singing? That, or the mating call of a heartsick troll.

Id: [0x002CE135]
Did you hear the noises from the house? Sounded like a bunch of rabid cats fighting in a sack!

Id: [0x002CE137]
Why do you quarrel?

Id: [0x002CE138]
Why do you quarrel?

Id: [0x002CE13C]
I am glad you stopped by. It brought me some comfort.

Id: [0x002CE13F]
You are far too young to speak so wise. There is a bright future for you and your clan. I would like to add to it.

Id: [0x002CE143]
I only care about your king, Saxons. [beat]Face me, Aelfred!

Id: [0x002CE144]
I only care about your king, Saxons. [beat]Face me, Aelfred!

Id: [0x002CE147]
You heard me! I need eggs. Viper eggs. Crusty little shits won't go away.

Id: [0x002CE148]
Eggs!

Id: [0x002CE149]
Yes! O! More. More viper eggs.

Id: [0x002CE14D]
O… that's much better. Getting closer … now. I can feel it. More eggs. More!

Id: [0x002CE14F]
O, son of a donkey. Nearly … there … just … a few more … eggs. Hurry! Hurry!

Id: [0x002CE150]
Ooah…! Yes!

Id: [0x002CE161]
There is the matter of my fee…

Id: [0x002CE162]
My prices are competitive...

Id: [0x002CE163]
Well worth a little silver, I assure you...

Id: [0x002CE186]
You got the honey? O, thank you!

Id: [0x002CE187]
The rock is just over there by the tree. Hurry before she comes.

Id: [0x002CE190]
Come on, Winifred. Shall we walk to the lake? Maybe we can splash in the reeds?

Id: [0x002CE192]
All that honey must have given you quite a thirst.

Id: [0x002CE199]
Yes, my dear! Feel the power of the goddess! Take it all in.

Id: [0x002CE19A]
But it is so … big…

If you don't give me Aelfred's jewel, I'll … I'll … widdle in your duck pond!

Id: [0x002CE19F]
This is your last warning! Give me Aelfred's trinket, or I'll piddle in your pond!

Id: [0x002CE1A0]
Is this what you want, you filthy swindler? A pond full of piss? I'm happy to oblige.

Id: [0x002CE1A1]
Alright, you asked for this! Remember that when your garden reeks of wee! Aah, that feels good![ONO Whoooooosh! - sounds of contented peeing]

Id: [0x002CE1A3]
My account must be one of the utmost grace, exhaustive, immortalizing the great acts of the prodigal Aelfred.

Id: [0x002CE1A8]
Do you believe him a coward?

Id: [0x002CE1A9]
He is a coward, as everyone says. And now he lives with Hel. Her servants Slow and Lazy, her curtains Dire Luck pulled across his bed.

Id: [0x002CE1AA]
You should win back the honor he lost.

Id: [0x002CE1AB]
I would gladly, friend. But we few will not break those iron-thick walls.

Id: [0x002CE1AC]
Ah! Watch yourself, heathen! You handle me too roughly!

Id: [0x002CE1AD]
Stand tall.

Id: [0x002CE1AF]
To fight for a king that you gave them, Finnr. Remember that.

Id: [0x002CE1B0]
To fight for a king that you gave them, Finnr. Remember that.

Id: [0x002CE1B1]
It was my task to find them a king, not protect that king against every danger that might befall him.

Right, right. No need to remind me how far I fell short.

Oswald wasn't crowned yet. Nor was he married. I say you have some work yet to do.

Oswald wasn't crowned yet. Nor was he married. I say you have some work yet to do.

Id: [0x002CE1B9]
King's Bury's church has a great horn atop its steeple. If you manage the task, blow it and I'll know you kept your word.

Id: [0x002CE1BE]
Unchecked, they will ravage the wild game in this area. And once the deer are dead, they may turn to us.

Id: [0x002CE1BF]
I would eliminate them entirely. With your permission, of course. And your help, if possible.

Id: [0x002CE1C0]
Good. A pack of wolves is a foolish thing to underestimate. Let's go.

Id: [0x002CE1CC]
If you would be so kind, I've had quite the day…

Id: [0x002CE1CD]
We'll head to the camp now. I'll have everyone singing songs and dancing jigs by the time you get back.

Id: [0x002CE1CE]
And Eivor. You have more than proven your worth. Help us reclaim our city, and you will have an ally in me.

Id: [0x002CE1CF]
Pass the night in our camp, Eivor. Take anything you need.

Id: [0x002CE1D0]
In this moment, yes. But, ah, you feel that? The moment has passed. We are free to pursue the next. What a gift!

Id: [0x002CE1D3]
These dogs will destroy the city's food supply! Protect the fields with me, Eivor!

Id: [0x002CE1D4]
Let your plague-ridden body feed my fields. Eivor, to me.

Id: [0x002CE1D5]
I want you to sound our battle horn to announce our victory. Let all the shire know that Grantebridge is retaken!

Id: [0x002CE1D6]
Good luck, Eivor. Thank you for doing this.

Id: [0x002CE1D7]
Eivor. I'm honored you have joined us.

Id: [0x002CE1D8]
Now let's rid these hamlets of Wigmund's rats.

Id: [0x002CE1D9]
Light your torches and set your arrow tips ablaze, Eivor. The red enemy of the branch will make quick work of this place.

Id: [0x002CE1DA]
Eivor! A fine day for being out, no?

Id: [0x002CE1DB]
You and I should take a closer look. My men will hang back and come running if things go sideways.

Id: [0x002CE1DC]
[laugh]You'd lose your elbow before the bruises showed.

Id: [0x002CE1DD]
Is that how you flirt, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CE1DF]
Eivor. What did Wigmund's little man have to tell us?

Id: [0x002CE1E0]
Eivor, you look like the wind has fled your sails. What's going on?

Id: [0x002CE1E1]
You insult me, Eivor. The night Grantebridge fell, I was working. In the shipyards.

Id: [0x002CE1E2]
You fight at my side, yet think me a spark of animal in a human skin? I know I am a dedicated woman. It's a pity you don't.

Id: [0x002CE1E3]
Eivor. This is a surprise.

Id: [0x002CE1E4]
I fought ragged to the brink of death, from one night to the next. You saw the end of it. Wolves almost took me.

Id: [0x002CE1E5]
Yet she is unburdened now. Lighter. She is a leader, not a friend, Eivor. Her mistake was thinking she could be both.

Id: [0x002CE1E6]
Lightning tingles my blood, Eivor! I hear the voices of my slaughtered people on the air, calling Wigmund's name.

Id: [0x002CE1E7]
I taste Wigmund's fear on the air. My fingers itch for his life, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE1E9]
Ah, while I have you, Eivor, I'm reminded …

Id: [0x002CE1EA]
Until next time, Eivor of the Raven Clan. I hope we will see you in Grantebridge soon.

Id: [0x002CE1EB]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002CE1EC]
We killed the wrong warrior, Eivor. A terrible truth that tastes of soot and ashes.

Id: [0x002CE1ED]
I … I mislaid my hammer. I think Beonton ran off with it, but I'm not … I'm not … I'm not well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE1EE]
Hm. If the codes of honor demanded his death, you did what had to be done.

Id: [0x002CE1EF]
Is that why you've come here? To earn Halfdan's trust? To find a seat at his table?

Id: [0x002CE1F0]
The silver Eivor recovered there now pays for our war with the Picts.

Id: [0x002CE1F1]
A thing of beauty. Frankish, I believe. What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CE1F2]
Ah, Eivor. We have missed your wit on the Jorvik council.

Id: [0x002CE1F3]
Ah, Eivor. Come, let me show you a wonder.

Id: [0x002CE1F4]
One sword is not an army, Eivor. Even a hero needs loyal friends. I have never lost sight of that. Never!

Id: [0x002CE1F5]
What does friendship mean to you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CE1F6]
Jorvik. You stopped the ill deeds of Audun and his swarm of rats. You can do the same here.

Id: [0x002CE1F8]
Eivor, just in time to divide the spoils. Take some mead, if you like.

Id: [0x002CE1F9]
I see. Because Halfdan thinks I'm disloyal, now you don't trust me. Has our battle-bond earned me no favors with you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CE1FB]
Hm. Perhaps you could speak with her, find out for yourself. She stays within Donecaestre, not far from here.

Id: [0x002CE1FC]
Thank you, Eivor. A thousand times, I thank you.

Id: [0x002CE1FD]
Eivor, search the perches and lookouts here. He could be spying from above.

Id: [0x002CE1FE]
Eivor! Something's there!

Id: [0x002CE1FF]
I'm beset on all sides, Eivor. By plotters and schemers.

Id: [0x002CE200]
We are owed this bounty, jarl! For battles won and blood let! Eivor, you tell him!

Id: [0x002CE201]
Hmph. I see. Say nothing of what you told me. He must not know that I am aware of his plan.

Id: [0x002CE202]
Press him, Eivor. As hard as you can! Never let up! And bring me proof of his treachery … or otherwise.

Id: [0x002CE203]
Come, race me to Jorvik, Eivor! Remind me of the glories long gone!

Id: [0x002CE204]
Faster, Eivor! Ride like Sleipnir's hooves!

Id: [0x002CE205]
Do you need another drink, Eivor?

Id: [0x002CE206]
I should break your arms for that! What were you doing?

Id: [0x002CE207]
That serpent cannot be trusted, Eivor! If he tells Halfdan of our plan, our victory is at risk.

Id: [0x002CE208]
You would do this? Draw up fake orders and pass them off as real?

Id: [0x002CE209]
Eivor. A moment with you?

Id: [0x002CE20A]
As any great leader must.

Id: [0x002CE20B]
Eivor, over here!

Id: [0x002CE20C]
Silk-tongued and loyal to the end, you backstabbing curs! Both of you! Traitorous schemers!

Id: [0x002CE20D]
A sick man? You deny you went behind my back?

Id: [0x002CE20E]
Eivor. Rise like an eagle, or caw like a crow.

Id: [0x002CE20F]
Leave me be, you devil!

Id: [0x002CE210]
Wh-what waits for me there, Eivor? What waits for me?

Id: [0x002CE211]
No more Saxon kings, Eivor. I am through playing the puppeteer. The fate of this shire rests on my shoulders alone.

Id: [0x002CE212]
Eivor. Yes, let us go. To inscribe our names in history.

Id: [0x002CE213]
Ah! I have to thank you, Eivor! For your counsel, for your blade. All this would not be possible but for you.

Id: [0x002CE215]
Eivor, make this man see sense. He is old, sick, and his mind is unclear--

Id: [0x002CE216]
Look at him, Eivor. Is this how a leader should behave? Halfdan! Come to your senses!

Id: [0x002CE217]
End of the road. Goodbye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE218]
After we located Eivor's probable resting place, I contacted you.

Id: [0x002CE219]
It's a nice place to die, Eivor. Not everyone gets to choose.

Id: [0x002CE21A]
You bested me. I don't know how, but you did. Yet I'm the one left standing.

Id: [0x002CE21B]
What a life you led, Eivor. What a saga you lived. If only someone had written it down…

Id: [0x002CE21C]
A person's tongue gives you a taste of their heart, Eivor. And such information is often useful.

Id: [0x002CE21D]
It was only a figure of speech, Eivor. And I have tired of it already.

Id: [0x002CE21E]
O, just a trifle, Eivor. A little problem I believe you can help me with.

Id: [0x002CE21F]
Eh … alright, you bested me.

Id: [0x002CE220]
God's trews! Fie on you. What infernal wakes me?

Id: [0x002CE221]
And I do not care. Did you want something, or did you just wake me to torment me?

Id: [0x002CE222]
Eivor? You have news?

Id: [0x002CE223]
I found wisdom. And I have been searching for more ever since. There is great vastness outside ourselves, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE224]
Eivor, we await your orders.

Id: [0x002CE225]
Is everything else in place, Eivor? Are we ready to take Rouecistre?

Id: [0x002CE226]
They were no match for us, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE227]
Peace, Eivor. Speak with Geadric and relieve him of his oath. I'll meet you at Cynebert's abbey.

Id: [0x002CE228]
Sit, Eivor. Eat. And let me tell you the tale of a man who talks with gods.

Id: [0x002CE229]
We cull the sheep and thin the flock as we see fit, you and I.

Id: [0x002CE22A]
You should have listened, Eivor. I tried to tell you. The gods are real. And their power is within our grasp.

Id: [0x002CE22D]
I'll lend my strength to yours, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE22E]
This will not be for nothing, Eivor. We will find Sigurd.

Id: [0x002CE22F]
I am your servant, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE230]
You have my word, Eivor of the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002CE231]
Eivor, didn't expect to see you here.

Id: [0x002CE232]
God be with ye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE233]
Ahlan wa sahlan, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE234]
Your brother is a busy man, Eivor. Weighed down by pressing duties.

Id: [0x002CE236]
Eivor, gods above! I'm grateful you've joined us.

Id: [0x002CE237]
Have faith, Eivor. A few hundred Saxons armed with hayforks and billhooks can be terrifying.

Id: [0x002CE238]
Eivor, have you lost hope in my warcraft? I heed Basim's wisdom, but he follows my lead. Always.

Id: [0x002CE239]
Prophecy, Eivor. Not hope.

Id: [0x002CE23A]
Basim, Eivor. To horse!

Id: [0x002CE23B]
An ally, Eivor. A most important ally. A holy woman who trades in prophecies and secret knowledge.

Id: [0x002CE23C]
Because I am alive, Eivor. My heart's alight with the fuel of battle-fire. Like old times, hey?

Id: [0x002CE23F]
Patience, Eivor. Patience.

Id: [0x002CE240]
Trust me, Eivor. Fulke is of great importance. You'll soon understand.

Id: [0x002CE241]
Eivor! Do the thegns live?

Id: [0x002CE242]
You do what you must, Eivor. I'll ready what men I've got for the coming fight.

Id: [0x002CE243]
We ain't ready to attack, Eivor. Eadwyn's still too strong. Too well supplied, and got more men coming.

Id: [0x002CE244]
This is our moment, Eivor. After this, everything changes.

Id: [0x002CE245]
Fulke is not the only advantage we seek here, Eivor. There will be treasures in Saint Albanes, more than we can count.

Id: [0x002CE246]
Perhaps I should leave you three alone, to hammer through your differences.

Id: [0x002CE247]
Approach the stone with an open mind, Eivor. You may find it more interesting than you expect.

Id: [0x002CE248]
I know the answer already, Eivor. I have seen it in my dreams. I know exactly--

Id: [0x002CE249]
Hold, Both of you!

Id: [0x002CE24A]
We will speak of this, Eivor! I will not forget!

Id: [0x002CE24B]
Your first oath is to your jarl. Sigurd Jarl, your brother and master.

Id: [0x002CE24C]
Remember your place, Eivor. Or nothing good will come of all this.

Id: [0x002CE24D]
That was always our plan, Eivor. I had no intention of betraying Geadric.

Id: [0x002CE24E]
That will lead you astray, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE24F]
It's not dreams that led me here, Eivor. I've had visions. Prophecies from the gods.

Id: [0x002CE250]
Hush, Eivor. Our sacrifice must find its way into the ears of the gods.

Id: [0x002CE251]
Cut them down, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE252]
Godspeed, Eivor. I will stay here. To pray for the souls of the dead before I join you.

Id: [0x002CE253]
Never you mind about me, Eivor. Go occupy yourself with Eadwyn's supplies!

Id: [0x002CE254]
We're with you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE256]
As you say, Eivor.

Id: [0x002CE257]
Eivor! Get to the portcullis!

Id: [0x002CE258]
You've felled the lofty lady!

Id: [0x002CE259]
That assembly of traitors act like all is well. One day, I will head down there and render them eternally nude, as God wanted.

Id: [0x002CE25A]
Dear friend, relax your body and cast away your loins!

Id: [0x002CE25B]
There's a fresh gorgeous beast of a soul joining us!

Id: [0x002CE25C]
A fair Dane joins the ranks of the liberated!

Id: [0x002CE260]
Greetings, Dane. This is our private celebration of skin. We are open to all who strip. Would you join us?

Id: [0x002CE264]
Very well, please leave us in our sacred place where we are free.

Id: [0x002CE268]
O, Winchell … yes. He was a bit too… hmm… assertive for us. He was overly tempted by bare flesh. So we had to send him away.

Id: [0x002CE26C]
Wonderful! A new member. Simply place your clothes in that crate hidden by the tent and partake in the liberation.

Id: [0x002CE26F]
I enjoy my wares. I'll decline your offer.

Id: [0x002CE270]
I enjoy my wares. I will decline your offer.

Id: [0x002CE271]
I met a man who claimed to have created this club. What happened to him?

Id: [0x002CE272]
I met a man who claimed to have created this club. What happened to him?

Id: [0x002CE273]
I would be honored to join your group. Where do I place my clothes so I can start dancing?

Id: [0x002CE274]
I would be honored to join your group. Where do I place my clothes so I can start dancing?

Id: [0x002CE275]
O! That's the crate where we put our clothes. Feel free to store yours in there too.

Id: [0x002CE276]
Just put your … hey! Stop that. Put it down!

Id: [0x002CE277]
Our clothes! Leave them, stop it thief! Garb thief!

Id: [0x002CE278]
Let the Dane go! Someone we know in society will see us! Quick, find shelter!

Id: [0x002CE279]
Yes! You have carried out my revenge! Wonderful. Now they must revel in their nudeness forever!

Id: [0x002CE27B]
If you like I have a luminous text with my teachings. A breviary of why one must trust their body's exposed sinew. Enjoy!

Id: [0x002CE283]
I'll be there.

Id: [0x002CE285]
Having trouble, farmer?

Id: [0x002CE286]
Having trouble, farmer?

Id: [0x002CE28B]
This is your house?

Id: [0x002CE28C]
This is your house?

Id: [0x002CE291]
So much for him.

Id: [0x002CE292]
So much for him.

Id: [0x002CE294]
So what was this all about?

Id: [0x002CE295]
So what was this all about?

Id: [0x002CE299]
Eivor! Is that you?

Id: [0x002CE29A]
Oswald lives!

Id: [0x002CE29B]
Oswald lives!

Id: [0x002CE29D]
It's not that. It's just not terribly Roman. It needs more. More relics, more statuary, more … Rome!

Id: [0x002CE2A0]
You don't like it?

Id: [0x002CE2A1]
You don't like it?

Id: [0x002CE2A5]
Gone, all gone! Damn!

Id: [0x002CE2AC]
[tut]Lads getting into their cups scaring the wee ones.

Id: [0x002CE2AE]
[scoffs]Well, the one who still draws breath is in the church.

Id: [0x002CE2AF]
I am looking for Glowecestre's ealdorman.

Id: [0x002CE2B0]
I am looking for Glowecestre's ealdorman.

Id: [0x002CE2B6]
These are the funeral embers of the last of my raiding crew. One by one, they have fallen.

Id: [0x002CE2B8]
I cannot weep! As a raider, I taught myself not to. Could you … could you give me leave to weep?

Id: [0x002CE2B9]
It is no good. I cannot … I-I cannot, uh, uh. O, god!

Id: [0x002CE2BB]
It is a good idea. I cannot weep, but I can still fight.

Id: [0x002CE2BC]
You've returned, vikingr. Are you here at long last to give me leave to weep?

Id: [0x002CE2BD]
Why the cursing, vikingr?

Id: [0x002CE2BE]
Why the cursing, vikingr?

Id: [0x002CE2BF]
You must grieve for your loss, friend.

Id: [0x002CE2C0]
You must grieve for your loss, friend.

Id: [0x002CE2C3]
Huh. It is always good to fight. But friend, it did not take away my grief.

Id: [0x002CE2C4]
Take this! Ah, this feels good!

Id: [0x002CE2CC]
Havi!

Id: [0x002CE2CD]
Havi!

Id: [0x002CE2D8]
Have you got a contract for me?

Id: [0x002CE2D9]
Have you got a contract for me?

Id: [0x002CE2DB]
I have completed the contract.

Id: [0x002CE2DC]
I have completed the contract.

Id: [0x002CE2E5]
I don't have any on hand. To brew this elixir involves great risk. You must be certain you are up for the challenge.

Id: [0x002CE2E7]
You're back. Have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x002CE2E8]
Very good. Let me get to work. I will have the elixir ready shortly.

Id: [0x002CE2ED]
Havi!

Id: [0x002CE2F6]
Alone with your thoughts at last?

Id: [0x002CE2F7]
Alone with your thoughts at last?

Id: [0x002CE313]
I've got to get him out of that pond. It won't be easy, he's mean and slippery.

Id: [0x002CE320]
Here's what I needed from the bear.

Id: [0x002CE321]
Here's what I needed from the bear.

Id: [0x002CE324]
(groan)

Id: [0x002CE325]
(groan)

Id: [0x002CE33A]
Maybe you could start by breaking things?

Id: [0x002CE33B]
Yes! Burn down our house! Burn it to the ground!

Id: [0x002CE33C]
It is … amusing, but not arousing.

Id: [0x002CE33D]
Take all plunder you want, vikingr! Take us also, and let the love-hunger consume you!

Id: [0x002CE342]
Stay. Be near Brigid, and keep your ear to the ground.

Id: [0x002CE343]
Stay. Be near Brigid, and keep your ear to the ground.

Id: [0x002CE346]
I will. Thor be with you, my friend.

Id: [0x002CE348]
This rest has been good for it. A Glowecestre prison is nicer than a night in our old barracks.

Id: [0x002CE349]
And your mission?

Id: [0x002CE34B]
Gunnar, how is your leg?

Id: [0x002CE34C]
Gunnar, how is your leg?

Id: [0x002CE34D]
Twists and turns.

Id: [0x002CE34E]
Twists and turns.

Id: [0x002CE354]
Hello again.

Id: [0x002CE356]
Eivor. You remember.

Id: [0x002CE357]
Eivor. You remember.

Id: [0x002CE35C]
I've got treats for you, Walter. Worms and such.

Id: [0x002CE35D]
Walter! You are gonna be in so much trouble when mum hears about this. She told you not to talk to goblins!

Id: [0x002CE398]
My name is Rima, and Gunnar is a good friend of mine. Asked me to run his shop while he's away.

Id: [0x002CE39A]
It is good to meet you, and strange to see Gunnar away from his forge.

Id: [0x002CE39B]
It is good to meet you, and strange to see Gunnar away from his forge.

Id: [0x002CE39C]
Well, as far as I know, he's got a very compelling--and beautiful--reason for his absence. So here I am.

Id: [0x002CE39E]
Well, if Gunnar has faith in you, I do too.

Id: [0x002CE39F]
Well, if Gunnar has faith in you, I do too.

Id: [0x002CE3AF]
This way. I last saw them prowling around just up the hill.

Id: [0x002CE3B3]
Look here. Bread crumbs and crusts. They must have stolen something from Tarben's store. Or off a table somewhere.

Id: [0x002CE3B5]
Ah. Smell that? That's a male wolf, marking his territory, warding off the competition.

Id: [0x002CE3B7]
A different odor. You pick it up.

Id: [0x002CE3BA]
Look. The wolves made a kill here. They're in the area.

Id: [0x002CE3BB]
Those trails … they must have dragged the poor beast away. We're getting closer.

Id: [0x002CE3BC]
Ah! See those teeth marks on the carcass? They're different.

Id: [0x002CE3BE]
That's right. Let's go on.

Id: [0x002CE3C0]
We were traveling through the forest when I spotted a white elk ahead of us.

Id: [0x002CE3C1]
Ah! Look at that. The pattern on the grass. They slept here.

Id: [0x002CE3C4]
That's right. It felt fated. We took him in and nursed him back to health. I was scarcely more than a toddler myself, then.

Id: [0x002CE3C5]
Hmm … these kills are fresh.

Id: [0x002CE3C6]
They're likely near enough to hear us. Probably fled the scene not long ago.

Id: [0x002CE3C7]
Come this way.

Id: [0x002CE3C9]
You lead, I'll follow.

Id: [0x002CE3CA]
You lead, I'll follow.

Id: [0x002CE3CB]
You saw breadcrumbs from where you stood?

Id: [0x002CE3CC]
You saw breadcrumbs from where you stood?

Id: [0x002CE3CD]
How do you know it's a male?

Id: [0x002CE3CE]
How do you know it's a male?

Id: [0x002CE3CF]
How did you come to be such a skilled tracker?

Id: [0x002CE3D0]
How did you come to be such a skilled tracker?

Id: [0x002CE3D1]
This is the pack's doing. Not just one.

Id: [0x002CE3D2]
This is the pack's doing. Not just one.

Id: [0x002CE3D3]
So your family found Wallace in the woods?

Id: [0x002CE3D4]
So your family found Wallace in the woods?

Id: [0x002CE3D5]
I am impressed, Petra. You have a raw skill.

Id: [0x002CE3D6]
I am impressed, Petra. You have a raw skill.

Id: [0x002CE3D7]
So you saw a white elk … and that led you to Wallace.

Id: [0x002CE3D8]
So you saw a white elk … and that led you to Wallace.

Id: [0x002CE3D9]
Where were we, again?

Id: [0x002CE3DA]
Where were we, again?

Id: [0x002CE3DC]
Mm. Let's hurry.

Id: [0x002CE3DD]
Petra. Look there. Slaughtered sheep.

Id: [0x002CE3DE]
Petra. Look there. Slaughtered sheep.

Id: [0x002CE3E0]
Mm. I should tell Petra about this.

Id: [0x002CE3E1]
Mm. I should tell Petra about this.

Id: [0x002CE3E2]
You there! Get to cover! Eivor, with me. Let's end this.

Id: [0x002CE3E4]
Careful, they're aggressive!

Id: [0x002CE3E6]
O God, O 'Struth! Please help!

Id: [0x002CE3E7]
Keep back! Keep back!

Id: [0x002CE3E9]
Ah! Help!

Id: [0x002CE3EB]
I am at your side.

Id: [0x002CE3EC]
I'm at your side.

Id: [0x002CE3ED]
I think we've found our wolves!

Id: [0x002CE3EE]
I think we've found our wolves!

Id: [0x002CE3F0]
O, thank you! Thank you so much! Both of you!

Id: [0x002CE3F2]
There. That should be all of them.

Id: [0x002CE3F3]

They were, God take 'em. They were all I had in the world. Poor blighters never stood a chance.

I lost my cows some months back. Now the sheep are gone. Frowning Jesus, what sort of farmer am I?

Id: [0x002CE3F7]
I'm sorry for your loss. With the wolves gone, you can recover in peace.

Id: [0x002CE3FA]
Not without the blessings of God, I won't. But I shall try.

Id: [0x002CE3FB]
Are you all right? Were those your sheep?

O! Goodness gracious me! Felix! Rosemary! My beauties! You are alive! Come here, my precious angels!

Id: [0x002CE402]
Well, that worked out.

Id: [0x002CE403]
Well, that worked out.

Id: [0x002CE404]
This was grand, Eivor. You hunt almost as well as you fight.

Id: [0x002CE406]
You are the first on my list, Eivor. See you soon.

Id: [0x002CE407]
Give me a few weeks, I'll learn to track as well as you. Or better.

Yes, yes. They tell stories, yes. Come, listen!

Id: [0x002CE427]
Aye, I've been ready. I am ready! Fists up!

Id: [0x002CE42A]
We will crown a new champion today! Me!

Id: [0x002CE42B]
The champion returns! I have no fight left in me, friend. But where is Loki Rabbit?

Id: [0x002CE42D]
Of course he was!

Id: [0x002CE42E]
The creature led me to treasure. Perhaps that rabbit was Loki after all.

Halt, stranger! Show me those arrows.

These arrows are the very same that pierced good Saint Edmund. I must study these holy relics! Thank you!

Play hide and seek with us, giant! I bet you hide real good!

I don't know what we saw, not exactly, but there's something up there.

And soon, something more grand to take place. Our wedding, my love … if you will still have me, that is.

I fought poorly. I melted under the heat and anger of that brute. And I never--

Id: [0x002CE591]
Oswald, stop. You fought. With all your heart and soul. That is all you need ever do.

Id: [0x002CE593]
Come, then. We have much to prepare for.

Id: [0x002CE595]
A bride to wed and a kingdom to lead. What some men wouldn't give for such things.

Id: [0x002CE597]
Hardly. My heart is afire, but my body aches. I desire only … a long nap.

Id: [0x002CE599]
Later, Eivor. For now I must see to the wounded.

Id: [0x002CE59B]
Aye. Of course you will.

You can. I won't go back up that cursed mountain for all the silver in this land.

Are you sure? Or just guessing?

Aye. He will live without fear. My brother and I will see to that.

Thank you, stranger. You are kind indeed.

You are wise, stranger. It is hard to give it up, but … it belongs to her more rightfully than I. Take it to her, please.

I would have given anything for another day with Svend, even a wordless one. He was not ready to go.

Id: [0x002CE671]
And I wasn't ready either. He was supposed to teach me things. I'm still learning.

Id: [0x002CE674]
Everyone looks at me like I will simply carry on his work. As if nothing happened. Because they don't know…

They don't know I'm not ready.

Mm.

Id: [0x002CEA53]
Tove, I'm sorry I wasn't there.

Id: [0x002CEA56]
It is Rolf, ja? We raided with you that one time, up on the northern coast.

Id: [0x002CEA57]
It is Rolf, ja? We raided with you that one time, up on the northern coast.

Id: [0x002CEA5D]
A shaft. I can see something at the bottom, but it is out of my reach.

Id: [0x002CEA5E]
A shaft. I can see something at the bottom, but it is out of my reach.

Id: [0x002CEA62]
Cut us loose. Hurry!

Id: [0x002CEA63]
That's what I like to hear. Meet me at the western gate of Grantebridge. We've assembled there.

Id: [0x002CEA64]
Walk with me.

Id: [0x002CEA65]
You think I don't know? This is for those who follow! To join me is to take an oath! To break it is to suffer!

Id: [0x002CEA66]
You see this? From a sea unicorn. I filter my mead and wine with it.

Id: [0x002CEA67]
You don't believe me, but I know the man. His gifts of wine. His easy smile. His envy. His plots.

Id: [0x002CEA69]
When? Tell me.

Id: [0x002CEA6A]
Good, go to him. Watch. Listen. Unearth his lies. You'll find them.

Id: [0x002CEA6B]
Do what you must, only hurry. I leave myself in your hands.

Id: [0x002CEA6C]
Lead on, then. I shall follow.

Id: [0x002CEA6D]
My scout. He asked me to join him here, but he's nowhere to be found. Have a look around, tell me if you see something.

Id: [0x002CEA6E]
You are traitorous worms, but Eivor seems to think you deserve pity. So I will give it this once.

Id: [0x002CEA6F]
You stand beside this … this traitor?

Id: [0x002CEA70]
You're not the warrior you used to be, old friend.

Id: [0x002CEA71]
Traitor! Kill him! Feed him to the wolves!

Id: [0x002CEA72]
Eivor will be your axe, abbot. Whether to fell a tree or hew the limbs from an enemy.

Id: [0x002CEA73]
Bugger off, eh? Or I'll call the guards. I'm sick of people. You need to heal your own ills.

Id: [0x002CEA74]
'Course I do! I'm apprentice to a famous flyter, the Silent Monk. Challenge me for it!

Id: [0x002CEA75]
For you, maybe. I'll be dead, and you still won't know a thing.

Id: [0x002CEA76]
Ow! Why do you smite me so?

Id: [0x002CEA77]
Ah, you prefer to work in the shadows.

Id: [0x002CEA78]
Go on…

Id: [0x002CEA79]
Beamasfield is just ahead. Lead, I will follow.

Id: [0x002CEA7A]
You have little patience for chittering squirrels.

Id: [0x002CEA7B]
When you find him again, come see me. We'll feast and sing, with mead and friendship to warm us.

Id: [0x002CEA7C]
Perhaps the stars write your path, and you will never have a home here.

Id: [0x002CEA7D]
Ah, now, you know that as well as I. But the rest of Cent, do not.

Id: [0x002CEA7E]
Remember our hunts beyond the northern way? Our first big kill was a ten-point deer.

Id: [0x002CEA80]
Rescue us! We can help!

Id: [0x002CEA81]
When we find her, I will tell you all you wish to know. Until then, nothing.

Id: [0x002CEA82]
I shouldn't'a made you pay. But the silver's been well spent. I've used actual barley for the ale, this batch.

Id: [0x002CEA83]
I'm well ashamed I almost made you pay. But it all worked out right, didn't it?

Id: [0x002CEA84]
And here's Eivor.

Id: [0x002CEA85]
How dare you!

Id: [0x002CEA86]
Don't wield your jaw-lightning over me. I asked for quiet.

Id: [0x002CEA87]
Right, this is not what I wanted. Stop it, will ye?

Id: [0x002CEA88]
You'll hear me howl as the men approach.

Id: [0x002CEA89]
Look lads, there's Eivor.

Id: [0x002CEA9B]
When I close my eyes, Svend, I see your designs on the arms of gods.

Id: [0x002CEA9C]
When I close my eyes, Svend, I see your designs on the arms of gods.

Id: [0x002CEA9D]
You have taught Tove well. Through her, you live on.

Id: [0x002CEA9E]
You have taught Tove well. Through her, you live on.

Id: [0x002CEA9F]
I am sorry I was not here to see you off, old friend.

Id: [0x002CEAA0]
I am sorry I was not here to see you off, old friend.

Id: [0x002CEAC6]
Dead? From fear or something else?

Id: [0x002CEAC7]
Dead? From fear or something else?

Id: [0x002CEAD1]
What is your name?

Id: [0x002CEAD2]
What is your name?

Id: [0x002CEAE5]
We think of you often, Dag.

Id: [0x002CEAE6]
We think on you often, Dag.

Id: [0x002CEAE7]
Wherever you are, may your axe protect you.

I do hope Sigurd knows how much he meant to you. We are beyond the time of telling such things now.

Id: [0x002CEAEA]
I do hope Sigurd knows how much he meant to you. We are beyond the time of telling such things now.

Id: [0x002CEAEB]
The clan is strong, Dag. I think you would be proud.

Id: [0x002CEAEC]
The clan is strong, Dag. I think you would be proud.

Id: [0x002CEAED]
We found him, Dag. Sigurd is returned to us.

Id: [0x002CEAEE]
We found him, Dag. Sigurd is returned to us.

Id: [0x002CEAEF]
He has changed, and for the worse I fear. But I am happy to have him back.

Id: [0x002CEAF0]
He has changed, and for the worse I fear. But I am happy to have him back.

Id: [0x002CEAF1]
Sigurd left us. I … I just thought you should know.

Id: [0x002CEAF2]
Sigurd left us. I … I just thought you should know.

Id: [0x002CEAF3]
I wonder what became of you. If anything remains of so strong a spirit.

Id: [0x002CEAF4]
I wonder what became of you. If anything remains of such a strong spirit.

Id: [0x002CEAF5]
And now only one remains.

Id: [0x002CEAF7]
Modron, well met.

Id: [0x002CEAF8]
Modron, well met.

Id: [0x002CEAFA]
You could have told me of your plight earlier. We are both friends of Brigid, and I know you would do nothing to jeopardize your friend.

Id: [0x002CEB01]
I must go to her.

Id: [0x002CEB12]
Carry on as if he were to return tomorrow, no matter what happens to this leaf.

Carry on as if he were to return tomorrow, no matter what happens to this leaf.

By Thor's hammer! It is Eivor! The Dragon of the Northern Waters!

Id: [0x002CEB15]
Make way for Eivor, the Terror of the Western Shores!

Id: [0x002CEB18]
That's Tewdwr's voice. So he lives!

Id: [0x002CEB19]
That's Tewdwr's voice. So he lives!

You made a poor choice in scapegoat, Gwilim.

Id: [0x002CEB1D]
You made a poor choice in scapegoat, Gwilim.

Id: [0x002CEB22]
Did I win?

Id: [0x002CEB24]
It was an honor beating you.

Id: [0x002CEB26]
No, but you fought well. You have a good chance.

Id: [0x002CEB27]
No, but you fought well. You have a good chance.

Id: [0x002CEB2A]
O, right. You're the victim.

Id: [0x002CEB2F]
I simply had not noticed your blindness.

Id: [0x002CEB30]
I simply had not noticed your blindness.

Id: [0x002CEB31]
Open your eyes! How can you miss it?

Id: [0x002CEB33]
I spoke to you out of friendly concern.

Id: [0x002CEB34]
I spoke to you out of friendly concern.

Id: [0x002CEB35]
Ugh, better than I thought.

Id: [0x002CEB36]
Hm. You were lucky…

Id: [0x002CEB37]
Not bad, old man…

Id: [0x002CEB38]
Ha! As weak as I expected.

Id: [0x002CEB39]
Truly awful…

Id: [0x002CEB3A]
Not your best work, All-Father!

Id: [0x002CEB43]
I haven't got the coin.

Id: [0x002CEB44]
I haven't got the coin.

Id: [0x002CEB46]
Mm. Thoroughly unsurprising.

Id: [0x002CEB47]
I haven't the coin.

Id: [0x002CEB48]
I haven't the coin.

Id: [0x002CEB4B]
I thought this could be our shared saga, but it is time to leave, and we have spent naught but a drink together.

Id: [0x002CEB4C]
I thought this could be our shared saga, but it's time to leave, and we have spent naught but a drink together.

Id: [0x002CEB4D]
Hmph. Lucky.

Id: [0x002CEB4E]
Where did you steal that one from?

Id: [0x002CEB4F]
Not bad…

Id: [0x002CEB50]
That one was rather … off.

Id: [0x002CEB52]
Really. Poor as well, then?

Id: [0x002CEB53]
I haven't the coin.

Id: [0x002CEB54]
I haven't the coin.

Id: [0x002CEB55]
Just awful! What a clown you are…

Id: [0x002CEB56]
Interesting, interesting!

Id: [0x002CEB57]
Well! Not bad!

Id: [0x002CEB59]
That one could use some work.

Id: [0x002CEB5A]
They're right! You are awful at this.

Id: [0x002CEB5B]
You lucked out with that one.

Id: [0x002CEB5D]
Out of coin. Next time.

Id: [0x002CEB5E]
Out of coin. Next time.

Id: [0x002CEB5F]
It pains my ears…

Id: [0x002CEB60]
Ugh. That was fine.

Id: [0x002CEB61]
Really?

Id: [0x002CEB63]
Huh! Not the worst.

Id: [0x002CEB65]
I'll get some coin and return to face you!

Id: [0x002CEB66]
I'll get some coin and return to face you!

Id: [0x002CEB68]
Yes, Randvi will be eager to meet Brigid.

Id: [0x002CEB69]
Yes, Randvi will be eager to meet Brigid.

Id: [0x002CEB6A]
Not bad, I suppose!

Id: [0x002CEB6B]
Surprisingly competent!

Id: [0x002CEB6D]
You missed the mark with that one.

Id: [0x002CEB6E]
That one landed!

Id: [0x002CEB72]
See, that big brute? Audbjorn. He does not speak much, but he could power a ship by himself.

Id: [0x002CEB73]
That shield-maiden is Ashild the Keen. Her blade is as quick as her wits.

Id: [0x002CEB74]
Rolf! Who is your friend?

Id: [0x002CEB76]
All right!

Id: [0x002CEB95]
Ha! You're no good!

Id: [0x002CEBAC]
Is someone there?

Id: [0x002CEBAD]
Is someone there?

Id: [0x002CEBB8]
Not bad for an old man!

Id: [0x002CEBB9]
That was almost good…

Id: [0x002CEBBA]
Your failure delights me.

Id: [0x002CEBBB]
Awful, awful!

Id: [0x002CEBBD]
I have returned.

Id: [0x002CEBBE]
I have returned.

Id: [0x002CEBC5]
Dag. You lived as you died, proud and defiant. I cannot begrudge you for that.

Wherever you now roam, I wish you well. I'm sorry that such a fire grew between us.

Id: [0x002CEBC8]

Die Modron!

I'll return with more silver.

I'll return with more silver.

Id: [0x002CEBD6]
A seer's spinnings twist limb and word alike. Prophecy is a river, and we are powerless to fight its clutches.

Id: [0x002CEBD9]
Take this!

Id: [0x002CEBDA]
Take this!

Id: [0x002CEBDC]
Can't afford the bet. Shame, as I'd beat you for free.

Id: [0x002CEBDD]
Can't afford the bet. Shame, as I'd beat you for free.

Id: [0x002CEBDE]
Stronger than I thought…

Id: [0x002CEBDF]
Weak, weak, weak.

Id: [0x002CEBE0]
How dare you…

Id: [0x002CEBE2]
But she ground your name to dust! Sullied the honor of herself, and her people.

Id: [0x002CEBE3]
She was fighting to protect her people.

Id: [0x002CEBE4]
She was fighting to protect her people.

Id: [0x002CEBE6]
Good, keep it coming!

Great!

We all lose our heads when our legacy is threatened, be that name, kingdom, or child.

Brutal, I adore it!

Id: [0x002CEBF1]
You can't go harder than that?

Id: [0x002CEBF2]
A good one, that.

Id: [0x002CEBF4]
I haven't the money to bet. I'll return.

Id: [0x002CEBF5]
I haven't the money to bet. I'll return.

Id: [0x002CEBF6]
Yes!

Id: [0x002CEBF7]
Yes! More!

Id: [0x002CEBF8]
Not very good.

Id: [0x002CEBF9]
O my…

Id: [0x002CEC1A]
O no. That one won't do.

Id: [0x002CEC21]
What a shame.

Id: [0x002CEC22]
Haven't the coin.

Id: [0x002CEC23]
Haven't the coin.

Id: [0x002CEC24]
Well done!

Id: [0x002CEC26]
How rude.

Id: [0x002CEC27]
A pity.

Id: [0x002CEC28]
Nothing to say? I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002CEC29]
You'll do better next time.

Id: [0x002CEC2A]
You're wonderful!

Id: [0x002CEC2B]
Too shy to speak?

Id: [0x002CEC2C]
You're such a talent.

Id: [0x002CEC2D]
O, not good. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002CEC2E]
Not nice.

Id: [0x002CEC52]
Come out, Walter! You can't hide from me!

Id: [0x002CEC5C]
You're no help. My brother is swimming around this pond!

Id: [0x002CEC5D]
That's not the right fish. My brother has brown eyes.

Id: [0x002CEC61]
That one smells like my brother, but it's not him.

Id: [0x002CEC68]
Another one! That's enough.

Id: [0x002CEC6A]
We thought it would be fun to get someone else to do the fishing for us.

Id: [0x002CEC6C]
And it worked! If you like, you could leave us the fish anyway. We'll swap 'em for brittle at the market.

Id: [0x002CEC6D]
Your brother looks pretty healthy … for a fish.

Id: [0x002CEC6E]
Your brother looks pretty healthy … for a fish.

Id: [0x002CEC6F]
So you "fooled" me.

Id: [0x002CEC70]
So you "fooled" me.

Id: [0x002CEC71]
Walter, we got the fish! Thank you, stranger!

Id: [0x002CEC75]
There's no ghost. Danes don't have souls!

Id: [0x002CEC90]
I can feel this Norse magic running from my fingers to my toes. I bet I can beat you in a race back to that body!

A monster slayer? Well, as a fellow warrior, I must trade for the axe in a warrior's charm.

You there, boy. Give me the axe before you hurt yourself.

Id: [0x002CEC99]
You there, boy. Give me the axe before you hurt yourself.

Id: [0x002CECAC]
With a warrior of your might, clearly it must be a battle to the death. If you fell me, tell my brother I love him.

Id: [0x002CECAD]
With a warrior of your might, clearly it must be a battle to the death. If you fell me, tell my brother I love him.

Id: [0x002CECAE]
Wait! No! I'll give it back, just … just no battle to the death!

Id: [0x002CECD8]
I hate this town more than I hate the building, or Lord forbid, God himself. Damn kids here keep ruining my offerings in His Glory.

Id: [0x002CECDA]
Windows! Do you know the work, the artistry that goes into making a sheet of glass into a martyr?

Id: [0x002CECDC]
Yes, they do! Moons of painstaking work! Shattered by one foul stone sent by pagan ruffians.

Id: [0x002CECDE]
You harbor a personal grudge against the Church?

Id: [0x002CECDF]
You harbor a personal grudge against the Church?

The pretty glass pictures? They do break easily.

Yes, and one that has bled this country dry for two summers!

A miserable clan you lead, Rued.

Id: [0x002CED0B]
A miserable clan you lead, Rued.

Not 'til I have taken all these shores have to offer.

Flee Rued, while pity restrains my blade.

Why does a Dane fight tooth and nail for a Saxon? This Saxon of all?

Id: [0x002CED1A]
He has in abundance that which you do not. He is fit to rule, fit to lead. You are naught but a murderous plunderer.

Id: [0x002CED1B]
He has in abundance that which you do not. He is fit to rule, fit to lead. You are a naught but a murderous plunderer.

Id: [0x002CED2E]
This land is rife with weakness, and you are just another blighted blot upon it.

Id: [0x002CED32]
And you … Eivor. Where will you go? Across the sea with us? Or back into the woods?

Id: [0x002CED36]
The ale here … it's strong.

Id: [0x002CED37]
The ale here … it's strong.

Id: [0x002CED3D]
Aye, stronger than me. You drink as well as Valdis. Now that I would pay to see![laugh]

Id: [0x002CED3F]
But I am stronger.

Id: [0x002CED40]
But I am stronger.

Id: [0x002CED42]
Hah, but I am stronger! Better luck next time, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002CED45]
This ale is strong, Broder.

Id: [0x002CED46]
This ale is strong, Broder.

Id: [0x002CED53]
Onto the next ruling! Shall we play in the woods or [beat]down by the river tomorrow?

Id: [0x002CED54]
Stools on the hay-side are for the woods, and the side with the sacks of beans for the river. Pick your seats!

Id: [0x002CED78]
Impressive! Impressive! Here, as promised. Now go enjoy the party.

Id: [0x002CED7B]
And you're no fun! It took so long to set those pots up, and I… [wincing] Ooh … ale.

Id: [0x002CED7C]
Barely a challenge.

Id: [0x002CED7D]
Barely a challenge.

Id: [0x002CED7E]
This is beneath me, Brothir.

Id: [0x002CED7F]
This is beneath me, Brothir.

Eivor, have you ever been in love?

I wonder if you know the feeling of having your very heart pulled from your chest as it pursues the elusive object of your desire?

Id: [0x002CF002]
I wonder if you have ever known the bitter agony of seeing your beloved in the arms of another?

Id: [0x002CF004]
I have known such a pain. And Maximus was its source

Id: [0x002CF006]
O gods, no! No no no! Maximus is a snake and a leech! A slime-encrusted bloodsucking viper of a man!

Id: [0x002CF007]
He stole from me my beloved … a perfectly-preserved statue of a legionnaire. It is all I desire in this world

Id: [0x002CF009]
Last I heard, Maximus was holed up in and around Lunden. Holding my beloved captive, leering and pawing at it no doubt!

Id: [0x002CF00A]
If you should ever see him, give him my regards. By that, I mean spit on him, then recover my statue!

Id: [0x002CF00B]

There is more. Just days ago, news from Norway tells me my family has been taken by the plague. All of them, all!

Id: [0x002CF015]
My wife, my children. All my pretty ones. It is too much.

Id: [0x002CF018]
You are a vikingr, as am I. Perhaps if you gave me leave, I would water the earth with a storm of tears to soften the pain.

Id: [0x002CF01B]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002CF01C]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002CF022]
Go, then. Leave me alone with my loss.

Id: [0x002CF036]
Father … why do men yell at one another when they have drunk too much mead?

Id: [0x002CF037]
Have you never wanted to loose your tongue and scream at someone? Throw hugr-fire and word-spears at those who anger you?

Are you referring to my father?

I was rowdy in my youth. Hunting, sailing. I was a wildling of the open air, before I became this staunch and stoic woman.

Id: [0x002CF858]
Thank you for heeding me, Eivor. I know the worth of such a gesture.

Id: [0x002CF863]
The spear … it is too rigid, too unfeeling, too fragile. And when the keen edge is lost, it's just a stick.

Id: [0x002CF864]
Isbjorn, the bear of frost. My father lived and died by that spear. Wielding it for his people and land.

Id: [0x002CF865]
But few saw what it did to him. It changed him, slowly but surely. A great man nonetheless, but one further away. Isolated.

Id: [0x002CF866]
It was a strange relief when he lost it on that fateful hunt. Robbed of his powerful relic … he took it as a sign to slow down.

Id: [0x002CF867]
And he returned to being a warm, affable man. The one you remember best.

Id: [0x002CF869]
The axe, on the other hand, blunted or chipped, you always feel its weight, its capacity for bloodletting, [beat]its burden.

As sure as I see you now! He's back! Our guardian is back, leading us to my brother!

Ah! The elk. He will know where she has gone.

Petra! Show yourself! It's getting dark!

Id: [0x002CF89C]
Eivor. Nice to see you here.

Id: [0x002CF89E]
Ha! Of course I am. Look at me!

Id: [0x002CF8A0]
No, no. Petra hasn't disappeared. She's close, very close. And waiting for you.

Id: [0x002CF8A1]
I am … I am sorry to trouble you, lord.

Id: [0x002CF8A2]
I am … I'm sorry to trouble you, lord.

Id: [0x002CF8A3]
Are you the white elk Petra told me about?

Id: [0x002CF8A4]
Are you the white elk Petra told me about?

Id: [0x002CF8A5]
It may be you can help me. Petra has disappeared. I need to find her before the sun slips away.

Id: [0x002CF8A6]
It may be you can help me. Petra has disappeared. I need to find her before the sun slips away.

Id: [0x002CF8A8]
O, I get on, you know. I eat, I sleep, I frolic. I want for nothing and enjoy every moment. It is a decent life.

Id: [0x002CF8A9]
And what are you and Petra doing out here, lurking about the woods. Hunting maybe?

Id: [0x002CF8AB]
O my dear, yes! Where could Wallace be? O where, O where indeed? Ha!

Id: [0x002CF8AF]
She was here a moment ago.

Id: [0x002CF8B1]
I cannot stay! Not here. Not now!

Id: [0x002CF8B2]
You are the guardian of this place. Do you live a comforting life … out here among the hills and dales of Mercia?

Id: [0x002CF8B3]
You are the guardian of this place. Do you live a comforting life … out here among the hills and dales of Mercia?

In a way, yes. We are looking for her brother, Wallace. She's been waiting for him all day.

Id: [0x002CF8C6]
Eivor. Stop! I'm here!

Id: [0x002CF8C8]
Eivor. I am right here. There is no need to question this carrion further.

Id: [0x002CF8CA]
What have you done to Petra! Answer me!

Id: [0x002CF8CB]
What have you done to Petra! Answer me!

I will make them talk, Petra! I must know the truth. I must know where you are!

You were visited!

Ah! Look there!

Id: [0x002CF8D5]
Eivor, come on! I'm up here!

Id: [0x002CF8D7]
There's no trick to it. I think about it, and it works. Easy as walking. Try it!

Id: [0x002CF8DB]
Yes, just try it! Move! Run in a straight line!

Id: [0x002CF8DD]
I believe so. We should ask the rabbits. They will know something.

Id: [0x002CF8DF]
Come on! Run!

Id: [0x002CF8E0]
We have been here before…

Id: [0x002CF8E2]
Right. Let us hope their spirits are not restless and that they do not wake to maul us!

Id: [0x002CF8E3]
Petra! I met your old friend, the white elk. But he vanished before my eyes, before I found you.

Over here!

Id: [0x002CF8F6]
Just come to me. I'll show you.

Id: [0x002CF8F9]
You did it, just like your Synin! And not a scratch on you. Now let's go! Wallace should be over there.

Id: [0x002CF8FA]

No no no! Too far! Too far!

Amazing…

Amazing…

Id: [0x002CF905]
Eivor! Look! The elk has returned!

Id: [0x002CF906]
Tell me, little rabbit, have you seen a man named Wallace around here?

Id: [0x002CF907]
Mm. I see, I see. Thank you for your help.

Id: [0x002CF908]
Good day, squirrel. I hope I am not intruding, but have you seen my brother Wallace?

Id: [0x002CF909]
Damn! This one doesn't speak rabbit.

Id: [0x002CF90C]
O no! The wolf spirits have wakened!

Have you seen the size of the sturgeons in these waters, any of you? Dwarves, most of them.

Id: [0x002CF91E]
The answer is clear! We shall play in the woods tomorrow!

Now, on to the next great matter…

Something wicked walks in East Anglia. Some other animals were attacked in the woods northeast of here.

Id: [0x002CF95D]
Thanks for playing with us, large walker!

Would be nice to have some cake, Sister.

When I was fishing with Trygve once, I dared to believe we had hooked a giant creature, a monster worthy of song.

Id: [0x002CF988]
It must have been hours into the fight. The creature would not give, it would not budge. Untiring, immovable.

Id: [0x002CF98A]
But I would not yield to a fish! I pressed on, and slowly a silhouette emerged from the depths, thrice as big as our boat.

Id: [0x002CF996]
We've been found![chuckle]

Id: [0x002CF997]
But these vast, cold waters hide a monster the likes I'd never seen.

Id: [0x002CF998]
Then a flash of armor, plated silver on the water's surface! A sturgeon surely! It thrashed violently and then it was gone.

Id: [0x002CF999]
I fell off the boat. Trygve, too. Cold was the water, but nothing rivaled the smart of shame having been thwarted by our dinner.

Id: [0x002CF9B9]
Likely sprained trying to climb up to rescue him. We are a sorry pair.

Id: [0x002CF9BA]
And what of your leg?

Talk of my feelings? To my brother? I would rather let the snakes gnaw on my tender parts.

Siblings are a source of great joy, and equal misery. I too have a brother.

But I'm sick to the back teeth of him. "Climb up, Arne! Go in that cave of wolves, Arne! Eat that red mushroom!"

Thank you, stranger. For bringing this waste of breath back to me.

Id: [0x002CF9CA]
I think it is time I take my leave.

That god-cursed bacraut has deserted again!

She's so gentle and kind, but if she doesn't get her honey I don't know what will happen.

Id: [0x002CFA3B]
I've tried poking it with a stick, but it riots them up something chronic.

Id: [0x002CFA3C]
I only want to scrobble a little. They have plenty to share.

Id: [0x002CFA3E]
But I need honey! Just a little. It's for my friend. It's all she likes to eat.

Id: [0x002CFA3F]

Surely you can spare a little honey? No need to get so maddened.

Id: [0x002CFA47]
Rose, Rose, do not jest with your father and his failing eyes.

Id: [0x002CFA4A]
Such a pleasure to have you at my side, Rose. But I'm so tired, so very tired. I cannot move those crates to shelter.

Id: [0x002CFA4B]
Very well. It is good to see you … again.

Id: [0x002CFA4C]
Very well. It is good to see you … again.

My friend loves honey. She has a very sweet tooth.

My brother! He's right in there! A goblin turned him into a fish.

Id: [0x002CFA5A]
He won't come out of the water to do his chores. Mum's going to be so angry. O, whatever will I do?

Id: [0x002CFA9E]
Right! Right. Yes. He's in the church.

Id: [0x002CFAA2]
Actually, if you're headed that way, this crate needs to be delivered to him. Just tell Geva I sent you.

O! That unholy visage startled me. It's past sundown, so Cynon has retired to the church for prayer.

Id: [0x002CFAB5]
As much as I'd love to get thee a word with the Lord, Cynon has a night of solitary prayer before his sacrifice.

Id: [0x002CFAB7]
Even if you have business with him, it will have to wait until the morning. Locked 'imself in, only Geva has the key.

Id: [0x002CFAB9]
She's been instructed not to. Not that I can see her following a task so simple. Girl'd forget her own head if it weren't attached.

You're not supposed to get in. No reason to enter that dump anyway. Fuck, you'd have to get me very drunk to show you inside.

Righ', gotta keep my eyes peeled for that crate delivery.[yawn] O no, I shouldn't have had that tea.

Id: [0x002CFAFD]
Wybir can whinge all she likes about me, but at the end of the day, it's me who Cynon actually likes.

Id: [0x002CFAFE]
Ah! The crate! Yes, yes, come this way. Good you came by, Sarah was supposed to drop it off ages ago.

Id: [0x002CFAFF]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002CFB00]
Well, look who it is!

Id: [0x002CFB01]
Eivor, shall we have a duel of words?

Id: [0x002CFB07]
Archers… Fire!

Id: [0x002CFB17]
Don't test my might. Please.

Id: [0x002CFB18]
Beware. My fist has broken many smiles. Not a fun reality.

Id: [0x002CFB19]
If you want the wallop, it will ruin your life. It has ruined many already.

Id: [0x002CFB1A]
I have much to attend to here, otherwise I'd lead you myself. Go now,[joking] unless you plan on killing me first?

Id: [0x002CFB1B]
Thank you, Eivor. Your mercy will be rewarded, I'm sure.

Id: [0x002CFB1E]
I have never been bested before. I am shocked! Stunned! I never thought it possible. You have thwarted my wallop.

Id: [0x002CFB20]
No, it is just my husband. He cannot satisfy his wife.

Id: [0x002CFB25]
Sigurd? Brother? What is this?

Id: [0x002CFB26]
Sigurd? Brother? What is this?

Id: [0x002CFB27]
Locked. No one home.

Id: [0x002CFB28]
Locked. No one home.

Id: [0x002CFB56]
It is a heavy loss.

Id: [0x002CFB57]
It is a heavy loss.

Id: [0x002CFB58]
Vikingr…

Id: [0x002CFB59]
Vikingr…

Id: [0x002CFBE4]
Ah!

Id: [0x002CFBE5]
Ah!

Id: [0x002CFBEB]
[cough]Mad seer, you have no fight with me.

Id: [0x002CFBEC]
[cough]Mad seer, you have no fight with me.

Id: [0x002CFBED]
I am one and many!

Id: [0x002CFBEF]
What trickery is this?

Id: [0x002CFBF0]
What trickery is this?

Id: [0x002CFBF7]
Desecrated. With a rage I have rarely seen.

Id: [0x002CFBF8]
Desecrated. With a rage I have rarely seen.

Id: [0x002CFC00]
Ah … so what are we looking at?

Id: [0x002CFC03]
Wallace? You stone-brained stoat! We've been looking for you!

Id: [0x002CFC04]
I was carrying quite a burden coming home. Slowed me down some. So I made a camp and picked some mushrooms for a nice soup.

Id: [0x002CFC06]
Turns out, I picked some funny mushrooms. Sent me into a tizzy. Tore off my clothes, woke up naked and bruised in the woods.

Id: [0x002CFC07]
So I snuck home, naked as the day God made me, and grabbed some clothes. Now I'm off to get my tools.

Id: [0x002CFC0A]
So the elk. Just another dream.

Id: [0x002CFC0E]
I had fun today.

Id: [0x002CFC10]
No, no! Don't go!

Id: [0x002CFC11]
No, no! Don't go!

Id: [0x002CFC12]
Mushrooms.

Id: [0x002CFC13]
Mushrooms.

Id: [0x002CFC1E]
There. Do you see it? The white elk! Leading us to Wallace! Just as before!

Id: [0x002CFC20]
Come on, Eivor! Chase the elk!

Id: [0x002CFC21]
No no, please! Don't disappear! Not now! Not until we have Wallace!

Id: [0x002CFC22]
I see him! I do!

Id: [0x002CFC23]
I see him! I do!

Id: [0x002CFE08]
Poetry about food! I quite like that, yes! Gooseberries … make merry? No, no … hm.

Id: [0x002CFE0F]
Down you go.

Id: [0x002CFE10]
Down you go.

Id: [0x002CFE15]
All your enemies have been slain. Now you rejoice.

Id: [0x002CFE16]
All your enemies have been slain. Now you rejoice.

Id: [0x002CFE2E]
So, I too must remain open to all possibilities, mundane and otherworldly.

Id: [0x002CFE30]
Perhaps. Or perhaps all of us, heathen and Christian, stand within the folds of a greater mystery.

Id: [0x002CFE31]
Which is why you tolerate a heathen like me.

Id: [0x002CFE32]
Which is why you tolerate a heathen like me.

Id: [0x002CFE35]
Arne! Fly! Fly to me!

Id: [0x002CFE38]
Stop pecking, Arne!

Id: [0x002CFE3B]
H-hey! Where are you going? You can't leave me here! P-please!

Id: [0x002CFE45]
Good fighting! What a beast we felled! You showed true grit out there. Thank you for joining our hunt.

Id: [0x002CFE46]
Not I, my wounds are too great and my spirit takes ship. Send them to Helheim … for me.

Id: [0x002CFE49]
Ride with the winged women, friend. I will handle this Grendel, whatever manner of monster it may be.

Id: [0x002CFE4A]
Ride with the winged women, friend. I will handle this Grendel, whatever manner of monster it may be.

Id: [0x002CFE4B]
We are done here. If we ever meet again back on familiar ground, you are welcome to join us.

Id: [0x002CFE52]
Th-that creature was even worse than a bear, truly. This wilderness is too much for me…

Id: [0x002CFE53]
I cannot wait to be back home.

Id: [0x002CFE56]
Arne did so well! You too, of course!

Id: [0x002CFE57]
Now, we can return home with our head high.

Id: [0x002CFE58]
When we arrived here, we thought the fighting was the hard part. But we were wrong.

Id: [0x002CFE59]
Getting the Saxons to accept their conquerors, that was the challenge. We pillaged and burned. Did what we do best.

Id: [0x002CFE5E]
I could bring you a chance at honor … an animal of some kind. Something you could handle.

Id: [0x002CFE5F]
I could bring you a chance at honor … an animal of some kind. Something you could handle.

Id: [0x002CFE66]
You got a few stabs in.

Id: [0x002CFE67]
You got a few stabs in.

Id: [0x002CFEB4]
Thank you for getting that man into the water. We had been waiting for too long!

Id: [0x002CFEF4]
Let me go. I can carry whatever supplies Gorm needs.

Id: [0x002CFEF5]
Let me go. I can carry whatever supplies Gorm needs.

Id: [0x002CFF00]
What wickedness is this?

Id: [0x002CFF01]
What wickedness is this?

Id: [0x002CFF05]
Everything has value, wise one, and I ask only a fraction of its worth.

Id: [0x002CFF08]
He beat Olav bad. Thrashed him and locked him away in the storehouse.

Id: [0x002CFF09]
You know why? Because Olav stole from Gorm and got caught. You're not stealing, are you?

Id: [0x002CFF0A]
N-no.

Id: [0x002CFF0B]
Good. Now less whining, more working.

Id: [0x002CFF16]
What would you say to a piece of Christ's cross? Snakeskin from Ragnar Lothbrok's death pit?

Id: [0x002CFF2C]
Pies! Pies! Get your sweet, warm pies here!

Id: [0x002CFF2F]
Our crust is unprecedented, a delight to any mouth! Blueberries, raspberry … and honey! A heavenly combination!

Id: [0x002CFF3A]
I heard Gorm took a strap to Olav?

Id: [0x002CFF3B]
Yes. The fool stole goods to trade with the skraelingjar (natives).

Id: [0x002CFF3C]
So Gorm dragged him off to the storehouse for a beating? That explains the mess.

Id: [0x002CFF3D]
Eivor's face now obscure, I've never seen one so demure.

Id: [0x002CFF41]
Where is Gorm at anyway? We have supplies waiting for him.

Id: [0x002CFF42]
Only Olav would know. But he had a kind of accident.

Id: [0x002CFF43]
Olav the Unlucky. The fool earned his nickname.

Id: [0x002CFF44]
This whole cursed venture is unlucky if you ask me.

Id: [0x002CFF57]
Breathe deeply! Watch as I become smoke … and listen as I break your bones!

Id: [0x002CFF58]
Seidr-using troll!

Id: [0x002CFF59]
Seidr-using troll!

Id: [0x002CFF5C]
And, the number of stones you're holding is … three!

Id: [0x002CFF60]
UNKNOWN VOICE

Id: [0x002CFF62]
No one can knock me off this hill. No one, I say! Just try it. You'll see.

Id: [0x002CFF63]
This is my hill. Every patch of it from the scrabble grass down there to the airy heights here!

Id: [0x002CFF64]
Quake and shit yourselves, all who would unseat me!

Id: [0x002CFF66]
My blood runs hot, my hands twitch with anticipation of yet another grisly kill!

Id: [0x002CFF67]
Not one step closer!

Id: [0x002CFF69]
Is that the spring I hear? It's nearby! Hurry!

Id: [0x002CFF6A]
I warn you, stop!

Id: [0x002CFF6F]
No one has ever dared to come all the way up before. What happens now?

Id: [0x002CFF73]
Huh... You again!

Id: [0x002CFF76]
What did you say to me?

Id: [0x002CFF77]
What did you say to me?

Id: [0x002CFF7C]
We fight!

Id: [0x002CFF7D]
We fight!

Id: [0x002CFF7E]
You little shit. How many times must I beat you to mush?

Id: [0x002CFF7F]
You little shit. How many times must I beat you to mush?

Id: [0x002CFF80]
Enough! I can't take anymore! I won't bother anybody any longer.

Id: [0x002CFF81]
Hold! I give in! No more shall I challenge everyone.

Id: [0x002CFF83]
See that you don't.

Id: [0x002CFF84]
See that you don't.

Id: [0x002CFF86]
I have business with him.

Id: [0x002CFF87]
I have business with him.

Id: [0x002CFF89]
Maybe it will come if I whistle?

Id: [0x002CFF8A]
Maybe it will come if I whistle?

Id: [0x002CFF8C]
Will it follow if I whistle?

Id: [0x002CFF8D]
Will it follow if I whistle?

Id: [0x002CFF8F]
Still, you did me a good turn, stranger. Take some meat for your help. The ealdorman won't miss it.

Id: [0x002CFF90]
I went through all that just so you could kill that poor beast?

Id: [0x002CFF91]
I went through all that just so you could kill that poor beast?

Id: [0x002CFF97]
The air reeks of stale wine. Are those barrels still full?

Id: [0x002CFF98]
The air reeks of stale wine. Are those barrels still full?

Id: [0x002CFF9E]
Epping Forest is full of it. And Lady Trotters finds it. [beat]Ah, she has the scent! Come, I'll show you.

Id: [0x002CFF9F]
Treasure?

Id: [0x002CFFA0]
Treasure?

Id: [0x002CFFA1]
No one kills the beast, it's worth more than all your lives put together!

Id: [0x002CFFA8]
The other children tease me. Sometimes they throw stones to shoo me away and call me the grubby watcher in the woods.

Id: [0x002CFFAA]
Winifred saved my life. I was curled up on the grass praying that God would take me too. And she scared the wolves away!

Id: [0x002CFFAD]
This kind stranger got you some honey. What do we say? Thank you?

Id: [0x002CFFB0]
Silly! I'm not alone, with the very best of bears by my side. Goodbye, and thank you!

Id: [0x002CFFB1]
Are you really all right out here on your own, little one?

Id: [0x002CFFB2]
Are you really all right out here on your own, little one?

Id: [0x002CFFB7]
Badger mask, same as me. Should come running when she sees you. Best of luck, and Happy Samhain!

Id: [0x002CFFB8]
Ooo. All sorts of spirit business I'm sure.

Id: [0x002CFFBA]
I'm looking for Cynon.

Id: [0x002CFFBB]
I'm looking for Cynon.

Id: [0x002CFFBF]
At it again? I thought I shut you up last time.

Id: [0x002CFFC0]
At it again? I thought I shut you up last time.

Id: [0x002CFFC8]
Have you seen Cynon?

Id: [0x002CFFC9]
Have you seen Cynon?

Id: [0x002CFFCD]
Looks like I have a new letter.

Id: [0x002CFFCE]
Looks like I have a new letter.

Id: [0x002CFFCF]
Ah, a new letter.

Id: [0x002CFFD0]
Ah, a new letter.

Id: [0x002CFFD1]
A message has come.

Id: [0x002CFFD2]
A message has come.

Id: [0x002CFFD3]
Eivor! Good to see you, I-- erm. Did you want something or… I was wondering…

Id: [0x002CFFD6]
Brigid and I were thinking, with everything calming down the way it has … maybe you could find a spare moment and…

Id: [0x002CFFDB]
I'll be honest, Eivor. I came here with the lot of you because nothing and no one kept me back there. The Raven Clan is all the family I need.

Id: [0x002CFFDC]
And Brigid too. From all she's said, she's better off here than with those she calls kin. Just a couple of foundlings, we are.

Id: [0x002CFFE0]
I am… Svend was a good friend to me, over the years.

Id: [0x002CFFE2]
That he was. But suppose we honor him best by keeping the clan going.

Id: [0x002CFFE4]
O, no, Eivor… You've been away. Sorry to say, Svend passed away not two nights ago. In his sleep.

Id: [0x002CFFE6]
Taking it hard. Very hard. You ought to go and have a word with her. Far as I know, she's barely left his grave.

Id: [0x002CFFE7]
Anyhow … you probably need something, eh?

Id: [0x002CFFE8]
Ha! Those invaders never stood a chance. Not when you are armed with Gunnar's handiwork.

Id: [0x002CFFE9]
Even when Dag was younger, he had a streak in him. Hate to see it go that way, but you did the right thing.

Id: [0x002CFFEA]
Nice to see Sigurd back where he belongs.

Id: [0x002CFFEB]
Between you and me, Eivor? Always thought you'd be a good jarl.

Id: [0x002CFFEC]
Eivor! I wanted to thank you, on behalf of myself and Brigid. Our wedding was the greatest day of my life.

Id: [0x002CFFED]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x002CFFEE]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x002CFFEF]
You want to be married.

Id: [0x002CFFF0]
You want to be married.

Id: [0x002CFFF1]
Yes … I imagined. Gunnar, to see you so happy has been a pleasure. And to marry you would be an honor. Shall I put out a call to any friends abroad?

Id: [0x002CFFF2]
Yes … I imagined. Gunnar, to see you so happy has been a pleasure. And to marry you would be an honor. Shall I put out a call to any friends abroad?

Id: [0x002CFFF5]
Then let's not bother with tradition. If you've your bride and your blade, we will see you wed. As jarl, I do it gladly.

Id: [0x002CFFF6]
Then let's not bother with tradition. If you've your bride and your blade, we will see you wed. As jarl, I do it gladly.

Id: [0x002CFFF7]
You seem sad, Gunnar.

Id: [0x002CFFF8]
You seem sad, Gunnar.

Id: [0x002CFFF9]
I know. I am sorry I was not here to send him on his way. He was loved.

Id: [0x002CFFFA]
I know. I am sorry I was not here to send him on his way. He was loved.

Id: [0x002CFFFB]
"Was?" What do you mean?

Id: [0x002CFFFC]
"Was?" What do you mean?

Id: [0x002CFFFD]
No… How is Tove?

Id: [0x002CFFFE]
No… How is Tove?

Id: [0x002D0003]
By all that is great, I cannot believe my eyes and ears! Now, you are pledged to the Kingdom of Norsexe! That will show him.

Id: [0x002D0005]
Thank you. As you are pledged to me, I am pledged to you. If ever I have an army to lend, you may make use of it.

Id: [0x002D0007]
Nothing! The arm-ring is mine. Mine! This kingdom was to be one of the greatest in England. The ring-shine has blinded you!

Id: [0x002D000A]
I found your arm ring. Amidst the wreckage of your ship

Id: [0x002D000B]
I found your arm ring. Amidst the wreckage of your ship

Id: [0x002D000C]
I am honored to forge an alliance with your stock, King Egwald of Norsexe. Long may you reign.

Id: [0x002D000D]
I am honored to forge an alliance with your stock, King Egwald of Norsexe. Long may you reign.

Id: [0x002D000E]
Your past is dubious. I cannot trust a man who lost his brothers so easily. And so, suspiciously. What really happened?

Id: [0x002D000F]
Your past is dubious. I cannot trust a man who lost his brothers so easily. And so, suspiciously. What really happened?

Id: [0x002D0012]
Indeed it is. Norsexe, and I am its first and reigning king, Egwald. And as sovereign, I seek a keen ally to secure my strength.

Id: [0x002D0028]
And? Verdict?

Id: [0x002D002A]
O, Lord.

Id: [0x002D002C]
Well … it was not for a lack of trying.

Id: [0x002D002D]
Well … it was not for a lack of trying.

Id: [0x002D002F]
O, please! I'm irritated enough already. The last thing I need is someone lying to my face.

Id: [0x002D0031]
My word … is this the Lord answering my prayers?

Id: [0x002D0033]
I've fished everything in Ledecestre but the eel.

Id: [0x002D0035]
O good! Please, add it to the pot.

Id: [0x002D0036]
Mmm... Smells good.

Id: [0x002D0037]
Hmm... Smells good.

Id: [0x002D0038]
What do you know? I am.

Id: [0x002D0039]
What do you know, I am.

Id: [0x002D003A]
Not the first thing I grab when I set off for the day, no.

Id: [0x002D003B]
Not the first thing I grab when I set off for the day, no.

Id: [0x002D003C]
I have your eel.

Id: [0x002D003D]
I have your eel.

Id: [0x002D004D]
Quiet! I thought I heard something.

Id: [0x002D006A]
O ho! Terrible!

Id: [0x002D006B]
This one is no match for you, Jungulf!

Id: [0x002D006C]
A sad, sad attempt.

Id: [0x002D006E]
Eivor. Good to see you.

Id: [0x002D0070]
Much better now, I think. I miss Svend every day, and yet he is here with me. His hugr (mind) infused in every design.

Id: [0x002D0071]
Believing that, it helps.

Id: [0x002D0073]
Good. Let's get started.

Id: [0x002D0076]
How are you, Tove? Holding up?

Id: [0x002D0077]
How are you, Tove? Holding up?

Id: [0x002D0078]
Glad to hear it. And happy to offer myself as your first canvas.

Id: [0x002D0079]
Glad to hear it. And happy to offer myself as your first canvas.

Id: [0x002D007E]
Excellent work, my friend! You impress me more and more every day. Here is what you have earned.

Id: [0x002D0080]
Men like Dag litter every clan, city, and century. The prideful ones. Men who never know when just enough is still too much.

Id: [0x002D00B1]
You'll be so happy, Sis! Someone bought a goat!

Id: [0x002D00B5]
Kí:ken ó:ia Kaniatara'kehró:non rotáhska.[The other Sea-Person is touched by the spirits.]

Id: [0x002D00BA]
But I will help you with your mysterious errand. I will, I will.

Id: [0x002D00C0]
Quality yule goats for the winter! Get them while they last!

Id: [0x002D00C3]
Hm.

Id: [0x002D00C4]
Hm.

Id: [0x002D00C8]
That man needs a push. Or a good scare.

Id: [0x002D00CB]
Kahrhakwé:kon iotahión:ni ne ken' niwahiò:ten's.[The woods are full of such fruits.]

Id: [0x002D00CD]
Yes, yes. All through the land, here and there.

Id: [0x002D00CE]
You want me to … to eat these?

Id: [0x002D00CF]
You want me to … to eat these?

Id: [0x002D00D0]
I feel much better. Do these elderberries grow wild around here?

Id: [0x002D00D1]
I feel much better. Do these elderberries grow wild around here?

Id: [0x002D00D5]
A moment in frozen water is a minor bit of suffering for a lifetime serving the Great Father! Do! It!

Id: [0x002D00D8]
A pity, Gorm. You will not meet her now.

Id: [0x002D00D9]
A pity, Gorm. You will not meet her now.

Id: [0x002D00DC]
A challenge nonetheless. What say you?

Id: [0x002D00E1]
I accept.

Id: [0x002D00E2]
I accept.

Id: [0x002D00E6]
Bah! When you change your mind, I will be right here.

Id: [0x002D00E7]
I could use a drink and shame you all at once, Broder. But not right now.

Id: [0x002D00E8]
I could use a drink and shame you all at once, Broder. But not right now.

O, wow! Thank you for showing me how.

I wish I had a more intriguing story for you. I came from Zhongzhou, far from here. For no real reason. Curiosity, I suppose.

I have never been so far west. I find it quite peaceful here. Calming.

This ray-sharing, this hallowed cup of loyalty … this endless--

Alvar is an old fool, trying to live his dream. But when do we bring in the harvest?

Id: [0x002D0319]
Look around you! There's no end of preparations we must do. Start where you will!

Id: [0x002D031A]
Yes! Bring ore. We'll need to repair weapons and shields.

Id: [0x002D031C]
But you have no blacksmith.

Id: [0x002D031D]
But you have no blacksmith.

Id: [0x002D031F]
I heard the Gyldan Sparrow was carrying more 'n candies and spice from Aksum. He had a hefty necklace in there too.

Id: [0x002D0320]
Bring planks! We'll face teeth-jarring storms. The ship will cry for repairs.

Id: [0x002D0324]
Fish! Bring them along. We'll have no time to catch more, what with all the pillaging. The crew will be wanting a nice meal!

Id: [0x002D0326]
A crew of two, it seems.

Id: [0x002D0327]
A crew of two, it seems.

Id: [0x002D0328]
Arrows! Bring as many as you can. Imagine the terror in our enemies' eyes when a hail of arrows falls from the blue!

Id: [0x002D032C]
Thor in Heaven, we'll need hay! We'll use it to set fortress walls afire!

Id: [0x002D0330]
We're ready to launch out on the roiling sea! Summon Skarde, Knut and the rest of the crew! Blow your horn!

Id: [0x002D0332]
O, by the gods! Will you blow that damn horn?

Id: [0x002D0335]
Enemies! Battle is upon us, men! Let none survive our bloodlust!

Id: [0x002D0336]
Wolves!

Wolves!

Id: [0x002D0338]
Huh! That was a battle for the ages, that was![laugh]

Id: [0x002D034A]
The crew fought like heroes. No Saxon survived, just like the old days!

Id: [0x002D034C]
No! Bjorn, Skarde, they were all here, fighting at my side. Heh! Just as they did in the raids of yore.

Id: [0x002D034E]
You're lucky to still be alive.

Id: [0x002D034F]

Has my fond husband calmed down yet? It's soon time to bring in the harvest.

No, he is still young and fit. It was not always so. You could not keep us apart when we were raiding.

You and Petra, chasing a white elk in the woods, high as wispy clouds, my God! I could barely breathe for laughing!

Id: [0x002D035F]
You and Petra, eh? Couldn't ask for a better match for my sister. You treat her well.

Id: [0x002D0360]
Shame about you and Petra. Liked you two together. But some things aren't meant to be. Glad there aren't hard feelings.

Id: [0x002D0366]
Remember Fidelis? He would never leave your side.

Id: [0x002D0367]
You and your mother made all our clothes. You were always a danger with a needle.

Holger wishes to prove that flyting is a lesser art. I am correcting him.

Id: [0x002D036E]
Very well. My victory can wait.

Not just now. Maybe later.

Id: [0x002D0372]

There's a skin deep resemblance, twixt Holger and me.

Id: [0x002D037D]
For inside, he's just hot air and bad poetry.

Id: [0x002D037E]
While in all but our talent, we're certainly twins.

Id: [0x002D037F]
It should be no surprise to see which of us wins.

Id: [0x002D0380]
Not bad. Now hear this…

Id: [0x002D0381]
You see, flyting is simple, so hearken to me! Look, anyone can do it, it's so ea-sy.

Id: [0x002D0382]
But the true challenge in life is to do something more. Like writing sagas, painting pictures, and … erm-- lore! Yes. Lore!

Id: [0x002D0383]
There! What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D0386]
Alvis is the clear winner, Holger.

Id: [0x002D0387]
Alvis is the clear winner, Holger.

Makes sense as to why The Compass would send the whole boat into the drink then. Bloody shame. Worth a pretty penny.

Salve, Eivor! We have not yet been introduced. I am Octavian Claudius Britannicus, a collector of Roman relics.

Id: [0x002D03BF]
Hello, Eivor! Wanted to give you this fishing rope. How do you like it?

Id: [0x002D03C1]
It's not from me! My grandfather insisted we give it to you.

Id: [0x002D03C3]
I think it's so you can catch fish for him while you're traveling. He'd love to see how you do.

Id: [0x002D03C5]
Well, if you do find something, just bring it here. He'll pay a good price!

Very much, thank you. It should come in useful.

They lived happily in the Land of Saint Martin all by themselves with delicious beans.

Id: [0x002D0567]
Lots and lots of beans! And cake!

Id: [0x002D0568]
But now, life is [beat]harder… There are no more beans, or cake, and we have to take what is not ours.

Id: [0x002D0569]
We're not bad children, just hungry.

Id: [0x002D056A]
Sorry, large walker.

Id: [0x002D0575]
Here, take this. It is not delicious beans, but it will fill your bellies. For a time, anyway.

What has your poison done?

Id: [0x002D0602]
It is the art … of the masses.

Id: [0x002D060C]
I have the treasure you seek.

Id: [0x002D060D]
I have the treasure you seek.

Id: [0x002D060E]
Do you? Please, give it here, then.

Id: [0x002D0611]
Found this necklace in the guts of a fish. I could not get rid of the smell.

Id: [0x002D0612]
Found this necklace in the guts of a fish. I could not get rid of the smell.

Id: [0x002D0613]
Even reeking of fish, this is priceless. Many thanks!

Id: [0x002D0614]
It is unrefined, unpalatable, unpleasant. I could beat you without a lick of practice.

Id: [0x002D0615]
That is not so, you thickheaded-- Eivor, care to judge a flyting?

Id: [0x002D0618]
I risked my neck swimming into the drink, so the spoils are mine.

Maybe I could hit the nest with something, knock it down?

Id: [0x002D061E]
Maybe I could hit the nest with something, knock it down?

Id: [0x002D0623]
I should have expected no less from you, Eivor. You have no ear for these things. A pity.

Id: [0x002D0624]
I knew it! Let my victory ring in your ears, Alvis! I will pen tales of this day that I bested you!

Id: [0x002D0625]
I do not know what you are thinking, Eivor. But do enjoy the monster you have created.

Id: [0x002D0654]
How long have you been chasing me, Wolf-Kissed? Seventeen winters? Eighteen?

Id: [0x002D0656]
Do I now haunt your dreams? Do I warm your loins?

Id: [0x002D0658]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002D065A]
You remember this…?

Id: [0x002D065C]
Your father's axe. The weapon of a coward, a scorn-snake.

Id: [0x002D065E]
Ah, few things would please me more than to kill with this blade.

Id: [0x002D065F]
But I know you would defy me to the death, fighting for a glorious end. That I will not allow.

Id: [0x002D0661]
You will live your final days enthralled as a slave, humiliated. Your death will be a lonely one.

Id: [0x002D0663]
Haha… Kill the rest of her crew. Make them suffer.

Id: [0x002D0665]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed is no more! That name is dead to this world!

Id: [0x002D0667]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002D0669]
To the ship.

Id: [0x002D066B]
You will be worth your weight in silver.

Id: [0x002D066F]
You move and I take your eyes. You hear me?

Id: [0x002D0672]
Winds blowing from the south.

Id: [0x002D0673]
We can tack north, then cut west.

Id: [0x002D0675]
Now, what did I just tell you, you…

Id: [0x002D067E]

Spin, deathly Jenny, dance and prowl. Weave through the baa-lambs, as they howl.

Id: [0x002D068E]
She'd be rotting away by now! Just like that boar you killed, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D068F]
We see everything.

Id: [0x002D0691]
Let's not tell your parents, all right? Now scamper off home. And take your new friend with you.

Id: [0x002D0693]
Who are you? A seeker. A wanderer. A killer. Woman or man, you wear a magician's cloak and speak to ravens.

Id: [0x002D0695]
Yes, I cannot thank you enough, Eivor. I feared the worst when I heard my old moniker, Guthban. Hadn't heard it in years. Dredges up fearful memories.

Id: [0x002D0697]
After my mother died, I sought family. Wilf offered it. He looked at me, took me in, and told me who I was. Who I could be.

Id: [0x002D0698]
I don't crave that belonging anymore. Among you lot, people accept me as I am. The greatest gift I ever got. Peace.

Id: [0x002D069B]
That means a lot. Thank you.

Id: [0x002D069C]
Tarben … are you satisfied?

Id: [0x002D06A4]
Ah, it's good to be home again … that is, if I haven't robbed myself of the pleasure of calling it home.

Id: [0x002D06A5]
Right. The ledger.

Id: [0x002D06A8]
Right. Payment in fresh loaves of bread. I can manage that.

Id: [0x002D06AB]
Tarben, in spite of all, you are welcome here. And you owe us nothing but the work you love.

Id: [0x002D06AC]
Tarben, in spite of all, you are welcome here. And you owe us nothing but the work you love.

But first, one scrap of your past remains.

Id: [0x002D06AE]
But first, one scrap of your past remains.

Id: [0x002D06C0]
You have an empathy. I see it in your eyes, having witnessed its absence in so many.

Id: [0x002D06C1]
You see a problem and you solve it. For you know it is better to see it done than to let it fester.

Id: [0x002D06C3]
A calling can feel like a curse, but you wear yours well.

Id: [0x002D06C6]
The curse of leadership, I suppose.

Id: [0x002D06C7]
The curse of leadership, I suppose.

Id: [0x002D06C9]
I suppose you don't build a clan of warriors without seeing your share of danger.

She's a kind enough woman. And she has faced greater danger than a few thieves.

Eivor … Sigurd wishes to speak with you. He is quite agitated.

Id: [0x002D06D6]
You will want to speak to him yourself.

Id: [0x002D06D7]
Has something happened?

Id: [0x002D06D8]
Has something happened?

Id: [0x002D06D9]
Eivor. The time has come. Our time.

Id: [0x002D06DB]
My final glory awaits.

Id: [0x002D06DD]
Do I not speak plainly? My time in Midgard is done. I wish now to see the hall of my ancestors.

Id: [0x002D06DF]
I know I have been in a fog these last few weeks. I know I speak words you don't fully understand.

Id: [0x002D06E0]
But I only ask you trust me, once more. On my final voyage. Back to Norway, to wish my father farewell, and achieve my destiny.

Id: [0x002D06E2]
If you must. I will await your answer, down by the docks. Do not keep me waiting.

Id: [0x002D06E4]
Our time for what?

Id: [0x002D06E5]
Our time for what?

Id: [0x002D06E6]
Your final glory … I fear to ask what that means.

I deserve the extra profit! I secured the sale and manage the tax. Endless hours of negotiating.

Id: [0x002D06F2]
The barley would never event exist without me. My barley is known across Mercia and Essex! "Sebbi's Slush"! My soul is in the mug!

Id: [0x002D06F3]
What's this? What do I have to do? Have I lost my touch? Am I cursed?

Id: [0x002D06F4]
You see! Wealth begets wealth. I am the one who called the ale made with your barley "Sebbi's Slush"! I am the genius.

Id: [0x002D06F6]
I … I just can't get it right. Stupid. You're stupid. A fool. That's what it is!

Id: [0x002D06F7]
You think you know what you're doing, but you don't.

Id: [0x002D0704]
They're small things, size of a lumpy fist, so they'll bake fast. Keep your eyes sharp!

Id: [0x002D0705]
And the butter? Do I … baste them?

Id: [0x002D0706]
No need, love. We'll leave the butter for mealtime.

Id: [0x002D0707]
I look forward to it.

Id: [0x002D0708]
Right then, I'll leave you to this. If you need me, I'll be doing the washing up next door.

Id: [0x002D070C]
As their guest, I volunteered to help with the daily chores. They offer me a bed. I tend the cakes.

Id: [0x002D070E]
That knowledge would benefit no one.

Id: [0x002D0711]
Quite a step down from your former work, lord.

Id: [0x002D0728]
Nonsense, it is not that complicated

Id: [0x002D0729]
You do not appreciate the subtleties of a cutting flyt. That is why you misunderstand.

Id: [0x002D072A]
Admit it, Alvis! I am the superior wordsmith!

Id: [0x002D072B]
Admit to a falsehood? I would sooner square a circle.

Id: [0x002D072C]
Would you join me for a walk?

Id: [0x002D0730]
It is a compliment, Saxon. Take it. What are you brewing anyway?

Id: [0x002D0731]

Id: [0x002D0735]
I call it Ledecestrescire sauce.

Id: [0x002D0757]
Eivor, again your people impress me with your skill. The invaders barely stood a chance.

Id: [0x002D0758]
I am sorry for what happened with Dag. It could not have been easy. May he rest in peace.

Id: [0x002D0759]
I am grateful to see Basim returned. There's so much more I wish to learn from him.

Id: [0x002D075A]
Eivor. Did Basim contact you in Norway? He said he would be joining you. Yet here you are, and I have had no word from him.

Id: [0x002D075C]
You mean … you mean you slew him yourself.

Id: [0x002D075D]
Hytham, this will be hard to hear, but Basim attacked us in Norway. Vengeance for some transgression of ours, imagined or real.

It doesn't come close to meriting such a sizable name, that's what's wrong with it.

Id: [0x002D0760]
And I've tried. Lord, have I tried. But I cannot for the life of me strike the perfect balance. I should just give up.

Id: [0x002D0767]
I read your message.

Id: [0x002D0768]
I read your message.

Id: [0x002D0769]
You said you knew nothing about The Order then. Plead ignorance. But you knew everything. Their names, their schemes.

You wouldn't happen to be carrying an eel would you?

Id: [0x002D0784]
They sounded more like rants.

Id: [0x002D0785]
They sounded more like rants.

Id: [0x002D0786]
Toss it in the pot, will you please? I've fished everything in Ledecestre but the eel.

Perhaps this elusive river-snake has been the answer to my sauce woes all along.

Id: [0x002D07C4]
Or do they know?

Blasted, cursed, horrible, rats.

Those rats! I tried everything. I poured lye. I harvested locusts, I hired children to kill them. I need an army of miracles.

Ha! You heathens and your gods … all I want is to rid my field of rats. Feed the fair folk of the shire.

I owe you my thanks, Eivor. For that, I give you this, the key to my study. That you may better understand the good you have done.

Id: [0x002D0C91]
With The Order all but destroyed, you have made room for a greater idea, one to take its place.

Id: [0x002D0C97]
But you are not from that Ragnarsson camp there, in Repton. I would have recognized you.

Id: [0x002D0CA8]
Let's have some fun with this righteous mob.

I'll put the fear of nature's claws into these superstitious fools.

Id: [0x002D0CAC]
I'll put the fear of nature's claws into these superstitious fools.

Id: [0x002D0CC5]
A universal, divine order. Inspired by God for the betterment of man.

Id: [0x002D0CC7]
You have saved England, whether or not that was your intent. Now, let England save you.

Id: [0x002D0CC9]
Look around you. God's works are wondrous, they cannot be ignored, nor resisted.

Id: [0x002D0CCA]
With a Poor-Fellow Soldier at its head.

England is no more, lord. You are the last of her kings, and yet you have no kingdom.

Id: [0x002D0CCD]
England is no more, lord. You are the last of her kings, and yet you have no kingdom.

Id: [0x002D0CD1]
We need to grab what we can before Harald has his say across Norway. But I only plan them now. I let others do the heavy work.

Id: [0x002D0CD5]
I did not mean you, but I could use your help choosing a leader. I have picked out a few to be tested.

Id: [0x002D0CD8]
If you want to see someone's true character, test it in battle.

Id: [0x002D0CD9]
I would like to help you out, but I have my own crew now.

Id: [0x002D0CDA]
I would like to help you out, but I have my own crew now.

Id: [0x002D0CDB]
Tested how?

Id: [0x002D0CDC]
Tested how?

Id: [0x002D0CF1]
My mistake. Apologies.

Id: [0x002D0CF2]
My mistake. Apologies.

Id: [0x002D0CF8]
Show me your picks.

Id: [0x002D0CF9]
Show me your picks.

Id: [0x002D0CFB]
In time, all those who accept God will flourish. And all those who defy Him will fall away.

Id: [0x002D0CFC]
Should you remain in England, you too will one day be her subject.

Id: [0x002D0CFE]
Damn. That may have earned me a night of washing linens.

Id: [0x002D0D00]
I do not know if we shall meet again, Eivor. God willing, we will … as one lord to another, perhaps.

Id: [0x002D0D03]
O, bloody crumbs! The cakes are burnt! Where is that man! Young man? Where have you gone?

Id: [0x002D0D06]
No, they should worry about me.

Id: [0x002D0D07]
No, they should worry about me.

Id: [0x002D0D08]
There is no comparing. You are building some reputation, Eivor. They talk about you up and down the coast.

Id: [0x002D0D0A]
This is my raiding crew, Eivor. What they lack in experience, they make up for in … other areas.

Id: [0x002D0D0F]
So, which from this unlucky lot would lead your crew?

Id: [0x002D0D10]
So, which from this unlucky lot would lead your crew?

Id: [0x002D0D12]
These are some trinkets you left behind, old man.

Id: [0x002D0D13]
These are some trinkets you left behind, old man.

Id: [0x002D0D14]
Erlend Wolf-Whip! Hear my name and know fear!

Id: [0x002D0D15]
Run and hide amongst the trees and thickets, wolves! Erlend Wolf-Whip comes your way!

Id: [0x002D0D16]
Wait … was that a wolf howling?

Id: [0x002D0D17]
Crawl back into your deep, dark caves, bears! Erlend Bear-Bane brings your doom!

Id: [0x002D0D18]
Erlend Bear-Bane! Hear my name and quiver!

Id: [0x002D0D19]
Wait … was that a bear growling?

Id: [0x002D0D1A]
Make sure to bring me a beast!

Id: [0x002D0D1E]
Not yet, but I'll keep trying.

Id: [0x002D0D1F]
Not yet, but I'll keep trying.

Id: [0x002D0D20]
Ah, it's you! Have you brought me an eel?

Id: [0x002D0D24]
And then, there is Thorgils…

Id: [0x002D0D26]
Keep your head on the fight or someone will crack it!

Id: [0x002D0D28]
That one is so thick, he could shatter your shield, but the other men like him. And those are the best of the bunch.

Id: [0x002D0D31]
[belch]No … not quite there.

Id: [0x002D0D32]
No … [cough]not quite there.

Id: [0x002D0D35]
You can borrow my horse, but I expect you to finish the job.

Id: [0x002D0D37]
Ahh. Here it is. Would you be so kind?

Id: [0x002D0D39]
Of course, for your palate is far less tainted than mine. Take a generous amount, too.

Id: [0x002D0D3A]
You want me to taste this?

Id: [0x002D0D3B]
You want me to taste this?

Id: [0x002D0D3C]
I suppose that's it then, it's over. Time for me to pack up my things and see what the fruits of another kingdom might offer me.

Id: [0x002D0D40]
Bjarte? Can you hear me?

Id: [0x002D0D41]
Bjarte! Bjarte! Come home!

Id: [0x002D0D42]
Follow my voice, Bjarte!

Id: [0x002D0D43]
O gods, Bjarte! Bring him inside!

Id: [0x002D0D44]
I can breathe again. You're all right!

Id: [0x002D0D45]
I was filled with worry.

Id: [0x002D0D46]
My husband … he was not supposed to leave home on his own. I fear he has fallen asleep somewhere.

Id: [0x002D0D49]
Where will you go?

Id: [0x002D0D4A]
Where will you go?

Id: [0x002D0D4B]
Worcester, I think. Though I'll be buggered if I'm going to name my sauce after that paltry place.

Id: [0x002D0D55]
[sigh]Thank you … for all your help. I don't know many Danes, and don't care to, but you've helped bring closure to this journey.

Id: [0x002D0D56]
If I could ask one more favor of you, it would be to take this failure to the grottos below my home. I can't stand the sight of it.

Id: [0x002D0D58]
Nudists? Those who bare their skin for pleasure?

Id: [0x002D0D59]
Nudists? Those who bare their skin for pleasure?

Id: [0x002D0D62]
But the group I founded has expelled me! O, if I could exact revenge, steal their clothes and render them nude forever, I would!

Id: [0x002D0D84]
So, those three, ja? I have handled more.

Id: [0x002D0D85]
So, those three, ja? I have handled more.

Id: [0x002D0D92]
Yes. I did not think Thorgils could do it, but he is thick-headed like his old man.

Id: [0x002D0D94]
He has grown, and now he will want to take everything from me. But such is the way of children.

Id: [0x002D0D96]
Wait - that is your boy? Tiny Thor? He used to barely reach my belly.

Id: [0x002D0D97]
Wait - that is your boy? Tiny Thor? He used to barely reach my belly.

Id: [0x002D0D98]
To all tyrants of garb! Let it be known you are vile garment-mongers! And you will know my name is Winchell the Robe-Free!

Id: [0x002D0DA3]
Take some silver for your trouble, and a little extra. For cheating you and Sigurd on that raid. Good luck!

Id: [0x002D0DC4]
I think it was nice!

Id: [0x002D0DC5]
I liked the part where they gave each other swords.

Id: [0x002D0DC6]
I'm never getting married. When I get a sword … I am keeping it!

Id: [0x002D0DD5]
You are right! Bollocks to him. I'll pummel 'em! Give 'em a taste of a laborer's fist! Fucker!

Id: [0x002D0DD6]
Impossible, I'm afraid. When my blood boils. The world must know.

Id: [0x002D0DDA]
Hmm… The situation is strained between these two brothers.

Id: [0x002D0DDB]
Hmm… The situation is strained between these two brothers.

Hej, Monk. No need to brag of your faith.

Id: [0x002D0DDF]
Hej, Monk. No need to brag of your faith.

Id: [0x002D0DE0]
You think I am stealing profits from you? You are stealing dignity from me. If I must raise my fists, I shall. O, I shall!

Id: [0x002D0DE1]
Come out and fight me!

Id: [0x002D0DE2]
No, no, use that stone. Eivor, use the large one. There.

Id: [0x002D0DE3]
I suppose. I … I accept it.

Id: [0x002D0DE4]
I love it. I wish it could gather it under my skin, surround my bones, and cloak me in silence, just the way it quiets the land.

Id: [0x002D0DE7]
Describe it for me, Sigurd … Valhalla.

Id: [0x002D0DE8]
And my father will not be with us. That much I know for truth.

Id: [0x002D0E07]
Not as content as I am with mine, I am sure. He allows me to avoid rage, I am never angry. Never.

Id: [0x002D0E08]
I am content with my gods.

Id: [0x002D0E09]
I am content with my gods.

Id: [0x002D0E0D]
You'll get nothing out of me. Nothing!

Id: [0x002D0E0E]
Insects like you would not be crawling out of the muck if Wigmund wasn't hurting. Talk!

Id: [0x002D0E10]
Father! The war is over! Our home is clean! You can stop stinking up the earth! Take a bath!

Id: [0x002D0E11]
It's over between Degolas and I. A man that disgusting, uh, I can't take it anymore!

Id: [0x002D0E12]
It's not my fault, my filth is useful! My arrows are more deadly covered in shit. No one was complaining during war.

Id: [0x002D0E13]
Mother, you won't believe it! Father has been cleansed. We can live without the toxic clouds he once produced.

Id: [0x002D0E15]
My love, you are finally clean, our home also. Come here my love, I can see your skin again!

Id: [0x002D0E17]
This clean feeling is strange to me. I was happy as a degenerate mud-ball. I never worried about these vain ventures.

Id: [0x002D0E19]
I feel I've sold my warrior self. The grime inspired my bow. My shit-arrows would strike fear into my foe's … nose.

Id: [0x002D0E1C]
Your desires are not always those of your gods, your family, and your … well, those you lie with.

Id: [0x002D0E1D]

Something has happened…

Id: [0x002D0E21]
Something has happened…

Id: [0x002D0E25]
Good to be here, Sunbeam! The people here seem a mixed bag of nuts and seeds. I feel right at home.

Id: [0x002D0E27]
Of course. A quick drink and a friendly brawl, and I will be ready for the raids ahead.

Id: [0x002D0E28]
Birna. Welcome to the Raven Clan's nest.

Id: [0x002D0E29]
Birna. Welcome to the Raven Clan's nest.

Id: [0x002D0E2D]
Please, I never betrayed Varin. On my life! I was frightened and I fled, and when I returned, everyone was gone or dead.

Id: [0x002D0E2E]
You spend your life thinking you're tough as leather and then…[sniffle]

Id: [0x002D0E2F]
And then two fools in love turn you into a blubbering glob of honey.

Id: [0x002D0E30]
It's wonderful to watch, isn't it?

Id: [0x002D0E33]
Our settlement is in quite a nice spot. Beautiful terrain. And the animals here are healthy and populous.

Id: [0x002D0E34]
But wolves are a worry. It may be why the Ragnarssons moved on. Humans upset the balance of nature, and nature pushed back.

Id: [0x002D0E36]
A wolf will do whatever it takes. They were displaced, now they come to our door.

Id: [0x002D0E39]
By attacking us?

Id: [0x002D0E3A]
By attacking us?

Id: [0x002D0E3D]
They stand out clearly from the soil and grass. See there?

Id: [0x002D0E41]
My family were hunters and trackers. From  further east than you have ever seen, I imagine.

Id: [0x002D0E42]
But I've lived in England for most of my life. This is where we found Wallace.

Id: [0x002D0E44]
Yes. To hear my mother tell it, we came upon Wallace abandoned … a babe in the woods. We took him in.

Id: [0x002D0E45]
You two are siblings as Sigurd and I are siblings. Bound by honor, not blood.

Id: [0x002D0E46]
You two are siblings as Sigurd and I are siblings. Bound by honor, not blood.

Id: [0x002D0E47]
I chased it, hoping to take it down. I lost it as I came to a clearing, and there on the ground … was a wee babe.

Id: [0x002D0E48]
Our little Wallace. Swaddled and alone.

Id: [0x002D0E4C]
You have seen nothing just yet.

Id: [0x002D0E4D]
And from that day forward, we were raised as brother and sister.

Id: [0x002D0E4E]
Eivor, hold … I hear something.

Id: [0x002D0E7C]
(scream)

Id: [0x002D0E7F]
Two more daggers to place here.

Id: [0x002D0E80]

Two more slots, two more daggers to find.

Ah! My soon-to-be highly coveted elixir. You see, one gulp puts you to sleep, and when you wake up, you are suddenly richer.

Id: [0x002D0ED3]
Here, you! Take your hands off my property! That ring is mine. Give it back, I say!

Id: [0x002D0ED5]
It sounds like one, I know, and I cannot explain how it works. But it does. Take that gentleman's elation as proof.

Id: [0x002D0EDE]
[laugh]I have not heard this ruse before.

Won't know until I hear it.

Id: [0x002D0EFD]
Very well. There are two crucial ingredients you must bring me. Bear testicles and fresh lichen.

Id: [0x002D0F05]
When the reeve died, did he take comfort in knowing he would soon see his god?

Id: [0x002D0F0A]
By his pallor, I would say poison took this one's life. What was he reaching for, I wonder?

I did no harm!

Loki curse you!

Id: [0x002D0F25]
Sigurd. Your father tells me you have a love-pledge with Sefa?

Id: [0x002D0F26]
No, not anymore. She called me a whale-face, and I spit on her foot. Those are not words a lover should use.

Id: [0x002D0F27]
Does Sefa know you have severed your bond with her?

Id: [0x002D0F28]
Fenton? Fenton…! Jesus Christ! Fenton…!

Id: [0x002D0F29]
Will anyone help? I think he went off to the north somewhere.

Id: [0x002D0F2A]
Fenton! I'm not following you into that forest, you woolly sack of mange!

You, alchemist. What happened to me after I drank that piss?

How should I know? I told you. I cannot explain how it works. What I can say is the elixir hit you particularly hard.

Id: [0x002D0F33]
Here, I have brought what you asked for.

Id: [0x002D0F34]
Here, I have brought what you asked for.

Id: [0x002D0F35]
There we have it. One Elixir of Miraculous Wealth. Enjoy.

Id: [0x002D0F37]
Have a care, stranger! Do not speak to him! Your immortal soul is in peril!

Id: [0x002D0F3B]
What? Who the Hell is Freyja? Is she the whore that tried to eat my cat Queen last week?

Id: [0x002D0F3E]
I feel your army of cats have a destiny unrealized. You are a Freyja of the Fens.

I find such an easy joy here. And to think we will be living here, I am overjoyed.

Id: [0x002D0F4D]
Heathen! This is a place for proud converts like myself.

Id: [0x002D0F4E]
I seek those who wish to join the great and superior holy path I am on.

Id: [0x002D0F50]
Have you recently tested your faith? Considered the holy path? It is a better way, I swear to you.

Id: [0x002D0F53]
I was just like you, a stupid heathen, lost and violent. Speaking of which, you should try praying before it is too late.

Id: [0x002D0F54]
We're under attack!

That sheep will be torn apart if I do not do something.

Come on, let's get you home. You do want to be home, don't you?

Id: [0x002D0F71]
Lucky I came along when I did. I don't much like wolves, either.

Id: [0x002D0F73]
Keep up, will you?

Id: [0x002D0F74]
Keep up, will you?

Id: [0x002D0F7A]
It works! The sheep follows my whistle.

Id: [0x002D0F7B]
It works! The sheep follows my whistle.

Id: [0x002D0F7C]
I am a strong, Christian, mild-mannered man of the cloth. My pagan past is gone. I am--

Id: [0x002D0F7E]
Go ahead and slaughter my livestock. It is not something I wish to do, but I would gladly allow you to do it.

Id: [0x002D0F85]
There you are, Fenton! You've escaped for the last time, you walking mutton chop!

Id: [0x002D0F92]
Yes, go ahead, destroy my crates and take my belongings inside them. God provides me enough.

Id: [0x002D0F9B]
Go ahead, destroy more. My faith cannot be broken.

Id: [0x002D0F9C]
Thank you, Lord. For sending this devil to test my faith.

Id: [0x002D0F9E]
Good day. Be well and beware.[hiss]

Id: [0x002D0F9F]
Never mind. I will leave you to your cats. Good day, lady.

Id: [0x002D0FA0]
Never mind. I'll leave you to your cats. Good day, lady.

Id: [0x002D0FA2]
She is a goddess much like you with pious and mighty cats that help her fight. Show your claws, good lady.

Id: [0x002D0FA3]

Id: [0x002D0FA5]
Stay out of harm's way, I will deal with them.

Id: [0x002D0FA6]
Stay out of harm's way, I will deal with them.

Id: [0x002D0FA8]
You see? I am not angry. Make yourself at home, it does not bother me. You will soon change from your pagan ways.

Id: [0x002D0FA9]
Perhaps that silly bugger was right, the wolves are fearsome. Thank you, you saved my skin.

Id: [0x002D0FAE]
Yes, burn it down. Make a pyre of the past.

Id: [0x002D0FB0]
Another who commands the beasts! The Devil's spawn is among us! Flee!

Id: [0x002D0FB3]
They are not mine, but God's. I have converted to God, and now I share all things.

Id: [0x002D0FB8]
Without anger in my life, I am completely changed, no longer obsessed with riches, like you.

Id: [0x002D0FB9]
You desecrate my integrity by insinuating such… But my faith cannot be desecrated. Praise be to my Lord.

Id: [0x002D0FBD]
I did not want anything to break.

Id: [0x002D0FBE]
That contains a bow given to me by Halfdan the Black after I put an arrow under King Sigtyg's left arm.

Id: [0x002D0FBF]
That contains a drinking horn I received from King Halfdan for capturing his bride, Ragnhild.

Id: [0x002D0FC0]
That contains a silver harpoon head I received from King Harald, for pulling Halfdan's frozen body out of the ice.

Id: [0x002D0FC6]
His voice yet calls to me still, in blissful forms, torturous to me. Yet the way remains closed. My way forward is … uncertain.

Id: [0x002D0FD2]
My home. It's where she … she…[sob]

Id: [0x002D0FD5]
I will help you. We will build Sphinxy a shrine together. Where should I start?

Id: [0x002D0FD6]

Who could Guthban be? One of us?

Id: [0x002D0FE6]
Eivor! A moment?

Id: [0x002D0FE8]
O yes, you. My cats? You're the one who talked about that strange Freyja?

Id: [0x002D0FE9]
Hej, lady, I have returned to deal with your cats.

Id: [0x002D0FEA]
Hej, lady, I have returned to deal with your cats.

Why is everything packed in straw?

Id: [0x002D0FF4]
Why is everything packed in straw?

Id: [0x002D0FF5]
That sounds like quite the shot.

Id: [0x002D0FF6]
That sounds like quite the shot.

Id: [0x002D0FF7]
Hmm.

Id: [0x002D0FF8]
Hmm.

They are a generous family.

The gods will get the idea.

Id: [0x002D1024]
The gods will get the idea.

Id: [0x002D1027]
We will leave under the cover of night. I will enter the camp alone.

Id: [0x002D1028]
We will not leave you, Editha, no matter the danger. No matter the risks. We do this together or not at all.

Id: [0x002D102A]
Sigurd told me the story of Loki and his anger at the gods. Why was he angry?

Id: [0x002D102B]
Because he was vain. When the gods heaped pretty praise on the serving men of Aegir, Loki could not contain himself.

Id: [0x002D102E]
I have tried to live well. It is enough that the gods know that, even if the name Harek Gand is forgotten in Midgard.

Id: [0x002D1030]
Done? That was to announce my arrival. Now, I leave this world. Enjoy your life.

Id: [0x002D1032]
Kind and courageous people live the best lives, but it can be a difficult path to keep.

Id: [0x002D1033]
Kind and courageous people live the best lives, but it can be a difficult path to keep.

Id: [0x002D1034]
Thank you for your help. You did not have to do this.

Id: [0x002D1037]
Hm. Mead is a delicious poison that gives men courage and robs them of kindness. But yelling is not always a wrong.

Id: [0x002D1038]
Maybe.

Id: [0x002D1039]
Why do you ask?

Id: [0x002D103A]
His pride was heavier than his heart. He lived for trickery and glory-hounding. He was jealous.

Id: [0x002D103B]
Loki would rather make enemies of friends than hear a good word about anyone but himself. Never be as Loki was.

Id: [0x002D103F]
Sigurd, stop that.

Id: [0x002D1040]
Did you see that? How far it went? A giant's arm, I have! The strength of the gods!

Id: [0x002D1041]
You know better than to take what is not yours, Sigurd. Must I tell your father how badly you behaved today?

Id: [0x002D1042]
Say what you like. He would not believe you!

Id: [0x002D1043]
He would … and then he would pitch you into the sea, and invite me to drink in his hall. Be warned.

Id: [0x002D1047]
Don't you know it's forbidden to consort like this under God's roof?

Id: [0x002D1048]
Don't you know it's forbidden to consort like this under God's roof?

Id: [0x002D104B]
You must be the abbess here. Why do you hide in a musky old church?

Id: [0x002D104C]
You must be the abbess here. Why do you hide in a musky old church?

Id: [0x002D104D]
Take what you want, heathen. Just leave us be.

Id: [0x002D104E]
I am impressed!

Id: [0x002D104F]
You made it look effortless.

Id: [0x002D1050]
Made short work of those bastards.

Id: [0x002D1051]
Eivor?

Id: [0x002D1053]
Eivor, you bacraut (asshole). I know you hear me.

Id: [0x002D1054]
What?

Id: [0x002D1055]
Do you often think of your father?

Id: [0x002D1056]
Yes.

Id: [0x002D1057]
I know you will.

Id: [0x002D1058]
We are not hiding. We sought to flee the shire in the midst of this ungodly war. But in our haste to leave, I lost my crosier.

Id: [0x002D105F]
I heard my father talking to the others. He said you were his child now, so … so that makes me your brother.

Id: [0x002D1061]
You are welcome to this family. Now we will grow together, and feast together, and scamper over the snows together.

Id: [0x002D1063]
I hope that pleases you. It pleases me.

Id: [0x002D1065]
What is it you are building now? Two homes? Or … a hill and a mountain?

Id: [0x002D1067]
This is my father Varin. And this is Kjotve the Cruel.

Id: [0x002D106A]
(crying)

Id: [0x002D106B]
Lean on me. I will lead you home.

Id: [0x002D1074]
Your journey has borne fruit.

Id: [0x002D1082]
Havi! Loki said you'd be here.

Id: [0x002D1088]
Are you drunk on these waters? Take your flask, forget the wolf, and let us be gone before the Nornir weave us a pair of shackles!

Id: [0x002D108A]
To ease your troubled mind, I will do as you ask. We need you focused for the coming war.

Id: [0x002D1092]
Perhaps you should move out of the way, atop that rock? The view will be much better.

Id: [0x002D1097]
But my offer is honest, and my magic is real. For a wife and a queen, I will give you the means to protect your kind.

Id: [0x002D1099]
So ask yourself … is one marriage a fair exchange for the salvation of Asgard and its people?

Id: [0x002D109F]
Is that why you've been off alone, hunting wolves and fretting about your future?

Id: [0x002D10A0]
You grapple with forces outside your control.

Id: [0x002D10A1]
Well, what shall I craft for you today, High One? Bottomless breeches for soiling yourself on the battlefield?

Id: [0x002D10A7]
As for your answer, many dwarves will die in the final battle. Ground into earth and reclaimed by the mountains.

Id: [0x002D10B3]
You mean from Asgard, do you not? My debt to you is paid in full?

Id: [0x002D10C5]
No, not unless Halfdan sent you.

Id: [0x002D10C6]
Ah, you're in luck then, for I have found the man already. I'm only waiting on him to get married.

Id: [0x002D10C7]
What business have you with a backwater king, anyway?

Id: [0x002D10C8]
You just missed him. He's headed for Elmenham just now, pleading once again for peace.

Id: [0x002D10C9]
If you go by the north gates and along the road, you may catch him.

Id: [0x002D10CB]
If you joined us at dinner, that might ease their minds a touch. Think about it. My doors are open to you.

Id: [0x002D10CC]
Yes, yes, you're absolutely right. I'm merely hoping you might provide me with … perspective.

Id: [0x002D10CD]
Wonderful. Visit us in Elmenham, whenever you have time.

Id: [0x002D10CE]
I'll see you in Elmenham. Until then, I must warn the other hamlets of this danger.

Id: [0x002D10CF]
And will I see you in the morning? We have much to discuss, I think.

Id: [0x002D10D0]
I hope so. I just need to prepare. I'll meet you at the islet.

Id: [0x002D10D1]
Hard to believe this one will marry Valdis, don't you think?

Id: [0x002D10D2]
[scoff] You expect the Danes to follow this pork belly?

Id: [0x002D10D3]
We'll be watching your back.

Id: [0x002D10D4]
You … I don't know you.

Id: [0x002D10E2]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002D10E4]
Just like you to keep a king waiting at his own wedding.

Id: [0x002D10E5]
A part of me worried you wouldn't.

Id: [0x002D10E6]
Without you, I'd be dead. Another wasted hope for East Anglia.

Id: [0x002D10E7]
Don't leave yourself out of this song. We did it together.

Id: [0x002D10E8]
A mettle not unlike your own!

Id: [0x002D10E9]
Even after draining so much mead? Succeed and you shall be rewarded!

Id: [0x002D10EA]
Yet I wonder. Is there any skill of mine that I could impress upon you?

Id: [0x002D10EB]
Aye, aye. But I could show you how to wield my … plow-sword.

Id: [0x002D10EC]
That I do. Will you follow me? To a place more comfortable?

Id: [0x002D10ED]
Would you have any words of wisdom for us?

Id: [0x002D10EE]
Must you win at everything?

Id: [0x002D10EF]
You'll have it. So long as I draw breath.

Id: [0x002D10F0]
You! Always getting in the way.

Id: [0x002D10F1]
You're leaving now?

Id: [0x002D10F2]
I've had my own words so far. Concise ones. But thank you for the offer.

Id: [0x002D10F4]
There, you see? Didn't I promise you a rousing hunt! Brilliant, simply brilliant!

Id: [0x002D10F5]
Could one of your clan help me return to Lincoln?

Id: [0x002D10F6]
If you offer an alliance in good faith, he will honor it.

Id: [0x002D10F7]
I am yours to abuse!

Id: [0x002D10F8]
I'll wait for you in my safe haven. Botolphston to the northeast.

Id: [0x002D10F9]
With his influence and your might, we shall rid Lincolnscire of the ruffians who plague this land, once and for all.

Id: [0x002D10FA]
Well, that's, uh … that's kind of you. Unexpected like.

Id: [0x002D10FB]
You travel with a marked man at your side.

Id: [0x002D10FC]
Yes … yes, you're right. Let's depart.

Id: [0x002D10FD]
O thank you, thank you! You'll save me from a decade of shame.

Id: [0x002D10FE]
Come to the southern gates of Lincoln when you've recovered it.

Id: [0x002D10FF]
Perhaps you're right, he's too contained. It must have been King Aelfred, then.

Id: [0x002D1102]
My heart beats like the drums of your dragon-boat.

Id: [0x002D1103]
All right. But be wary. I won't be the swiftest sword if all this goes tits up, you should know.

Id: [0x002D1104]
O, yes, of this I am well aware. Blunt and stalwart, honest and true. I have a Dane ladylove with all those qualities, you know.

Id: [0x002D1105]
It's bad enough I've got these armored codpieces watching me work. Now you…

Id: [0x002D1106]
I'd be risking my neck telling you anything. And if my head rolls, these sick and ailing folk will follow me to the grave.

Id: [0x002D1107]
I don't. And if you like your hide where it's at, you won't ask that 'round here again!

Id: [0x002D1108]
You could try, but he never speaks when others are present.

Id: [0x002D1109]
Have you need of anything?

Id: [0x002D110A]
And you.

Id: [0x002D110B]
Please. Do not desecrate our lord.

Id: [0x002D110C]
The shiremoot is a lawful, Godly assembly. Hunwald will be safe, as will you be.

Id: [0x002D110D]
None here wishes the boy ill, but do what you think necessary.

Id: [0x002D110E]
I would tell you my fate is in the hands of our Lord. But somehow I believe that won't be the whole story.

Id: [0x002D110F]
You know what? We should visit her! We should go to Brimsgy! Er, Grimsby! Yes, yes, there's no time to lose!

Id: [0x002D1110]
No, no. You're better suited to such gifts. I'm a talker, not a fighter.

Id: [0x002D1111]
Here I am, with a chance to be ealdorman, but I have yet to prove myself worthy. To you. To the Shire. To her!

Id: [0x002D1112]
I can do nothing without my darling lady. You've made me realize how much I've neglected her through this fatal stupor of mine!

Id: [0x002D1113]
I beg your pardon?

Id: [0x002D1114]
He left it here when we last hunted together. I now wish you to have it.

Id: [0x002D1115]
I thought you might like it!

Id: [0x002D1116]
What I mean to say is, I enjoy the company of your people. Or people like you. What little I've seen of them.

Id: [0x002D1117]
It now falls to you to break this impasse.

Id: [0x002D1118]
I pray that God guides your vote today … and not the Devil, as I fear.

Id: [0x002D1119]
Have I heard aright? That you have come to break us from our deadlock?

Id: [0x002D111A]
God knows the love that lives in my heart for the people of Lincolnscire. I pray now that he guides your hand accordingly.

Id: [0x002D111B]
Well then, I thank you, for what it's worth. God go with you.

Id: [0x002D111C]
But I do need it. The vote is closer than a cat's whisker.

Id: [0x002D111D]
Which of these sad puppets will dance best when you call upon them?

Id: [0x002D111E]
Name your need.

Id: [0x002D111F]
An eager fyrd awaits my voice to lead them into battle. Will you ride with us?

Id: [0x002D1120]
Do you?

Id: [0x002D1121]
When songs are sung of the day Lincolnscire was saved, your name will ripple through every stanza.

Id: [0x002D1122]
Here's the camp, do you see? The fyrd will soon be ready for action!

Id: [0x002D1123]
I'll stick you like a pig!

Id: [0x002D1124]
I would ask a favor, if I could.

Id: [0x002D1125]
Would you allow my Swanburrow to take refuge in your settlement? At least until I feel all danger has passed.

Id: [0x002D1126]
Yes, of course, you did. Forgive me. I'm not yet accustomed to the size of the task before me.

Id: [0x002D1127]
O, Lunden's cleaning ladies are the best at removing blood stains. She could do wonders for your clothes.

Id: [0x002D1128]
These are the good citizens of Lunden. Here to thank you for your help.

Id: [0x002D1129]
Without you, these walls might have crumbled beneath the grasping vines of The Order.

Id: [0x002D112A]
And we … we'd be but poor fiefs of heathen scum!

Id: [0x002D112B]
Stowe gave me work manning the springalds, no thanks to you.

Id: [0x002D112C]
Ah. It's you…

Id: [0x002D112D]
You've such beautiful eyes. Finish it … would you?

Id: [0x002D112E]
Lunden is only a beginning. My order reaches further than your tiny boats can take you.

Id: [0x002D112F]
Watch your head there!

Id: [0x002D1130]
Right then, you've some dealings with Governor Tryggr, was that it?

Id: [0x002D1131]
Ach, no. Tryggr's your fellow. I'm the shire reeve (sheriff) of Lunden's westerly half. I keep things ordered and fair.

Id: [0x002D1132]
Well, your candor is … appreciated.

Id: [0x002D1133]
We'll get along well, you and me.

Id: [0x002D1134]
Erke Bodilsson, yes I am. Are you telling me this gut-bucket called me second reeve?

Id: [0x002D1135]
Said he was a Frankish captain, did you? To find him, we'd have to mark the ships that came and went along the Thames.

Id: [0x002D1136]
How goes your plan? Have you managed to find a coin for the contest?

Id: [0x002D1137]
How do I know you aren't some rat looking to sink our ship?

Id: [0x002D1138]
But, do you align with our values? What think you of outlanders?

Id: [0x002D1139]
Yeah, right. Begone, 'afore I kick your teeth in.

Id: [0x002D113A]
Verily, I believe you.

Id: [0x002D113B]
Recite the phrase "May The Father of Understanding Guide Us," and he'll know it's you.

Id: [0x002D113C]
You've got quite an eagle-eye on you.

Id: [0x002D113D]
What's your business, shooting or watching?

Id: [0x002D113E]
That's deadly aim you have. Best I've seen for some time.

Id: [0x002D113F]
You can always forfeit if you're not having fun!

Id: [0x002D1140]
You're to stand just there. Look your best when The Arrow comes forth. And keep still.

Id: [0x002D1141]
The Arrow hasn't got any friends, only pupils. Stay here among the crowd.

Id: [0x002D1142]
No, you've no reason to lie. Yet Avgos, my old friend, had no cause to murder.

Id: [0x002D1143]
Erke should be down at the quays. He'll be waiting for you.

Id: [0x002D1144]
Heard from Stowe yet? About The Arrow?

Id: [0x002D1145]
I trust you'll find my Regna. There's nothing for me without her.

Id: [0x002D1146]
I'm warning you!

Id: [0x002D1147]
You thick shit! Not Hel nor Valholl will want you once I'm done.

Id: [0x002D1148]
What have you to do with him?

Id: [0x002D1149]
Hold! I'll give you anything! The purse at my belt!

Id: [0x002D114A]
You wouldn't know it was ever broken.

Id: [0x002D114B]
You may be right. We can't return the dead to life, but their sacrifice can mean something.

Id: [0x002D114C]
You're right, it would be like plucking straw from shit. Too much bad with the good.

Id: [0x002D114D]
If you need me, I'll be at Saint Paul's, searching for something on The Compass.

Id: [0x002D114E]
I'll give you cover when I can.

Id: [0x002D114F]
Not half of either. And far better for the blood on your blade.

Id: [0x002D1150]
A silver ring for your raven perch. It was Tryggr's before he gifted it to me.

Id: [0x002D1151]
If you speak with her, pass on that we have run out of ale.

Id: [0x002D1152]
You! Guards will come at one cry from me.

Id: [0x002D1153]
One such affair is why we called for you.

Id: [0x002D1154]
We shall speak again when you return my errant husband.

Id: [0x002D1155]
Are you a spirit? Is this my bitter end?

Id: [0x002D1156]
Ha! Your weapon strikes true!

Id: [0x002D1157]
Do not let them charge you!

Id: [0x002D1158]
When do they not? You could return and report that the savage claw took me. "Poor Birstan, his exit, pursued by a bear!"

Id: [0x002D1159]
As family, we are as close as Cain and Abel. She is a willful woman, and I am a bad husband. You know me, it seems?

Id: [0x002D115D]
It is! What an insight. Now please leave me alone before the brightness of your wit blinds me.

Id: [0x002D115F]
Some time ago, we paid a Dane to kidnap me and ferry me safely to Francia. As you can see, he did not deliver.

Id: [0x002D1160]
We can hope! You must fan the flame. Find her, bring her to my lakeside cottage, and light a bonfire there. I will know to come.

Id: [0x002D1161]
I'm Eluric, the man of this house. Who are you, and why have you come?

Id: [0x002D1162]
If you promise you'll find her, I will.

Id: [0x002D1163]
Why are you following me? My sister is in peril!

Id: [0x002D1164]
You would judge us? My parents died and left me alone with a babe when I was little more than a girl myself.

Id: [0x002D1165]
Of course! You are absolutely right. And we have a lifetime to recapture what was mislaid.

Id: [0x002D1166]
I know just the one! And her captain is full of fire. Come, I will take you to him.

Id: [0x002D1167]
There you are!

Id: [0x002D1168]
And who are you to Estrid?

Id: [0x002D1169]
Then you must forgive me. Those Saxons knew about my camp. I was mind-drunk to leave my warriors behind!

Id: [0x002D116A]
Northeast of here, by the river's mouth. Follow me, or come when you can!

Id: [0x002D116B]
And King Aelfred? Can you imagine their king in the sky-blanket Tyr sends our lands?

Id: [0x002D116C]
Aye, Rollo's sworn sword-sister. I've served him proud and true. You cannot think I betrayed him?

Id: [0x002D116D]
Lork? You believe that old crow? His bones crumble, and his mind wanders with age. Or he wallows in jealousy, take your pick.

Id: [0x002D116E]
I hope you chose well, for you denied them a seat in my hall.

Id: [0x002D116F]
That I do. Command me now, and I will follow your lead.

Id: [0x002D1170]
You shame me, and rightly so. Love cuts deeper than an axe, but I'll dwell on the pain no longer. My people need me.

Id: [0x002D1171]
We had our time together. Now that's done. I will not fail you here, nor her.

Id: [0x002D1172]
Put that aside. We're ready now. What would you have of us?

Id: [0x002D1173]
A woman fights bravely against her abductors. Yet what will they do with me now? Is my virtue safe with you?

Id: [0x002D1174]
Come find me, if you like. Away from these reveling Danes.

Id: [0x002D1175]
Boar! A majestic animal, don't you think? Driven by a fierce fire, blazing eyes, and sword-tusks.

Id: [0x002D1176]
How wondrously strange! Your tales are worthy of the hearing. We'll not ride our boars but eat them! A feast in Alfida's honor.

Id: [0x002D1177]
Good. Now leave. And if we meet again, you will fall by my sword.

Id: [0x002D1179]
Do you speak Latin? Magister Bata says I cannot play until I learn "I will not eat apples in class." Urm … ego … poma…

Id: [0x002D117A]
Ah, it's you. Please don't be angry. She made me do it!

Id: [0x002D117B]
No, she left. She told me to come too, but I want to be better. Do you think I can be better?

Id: [0x002D117C]
Do you hear that?

Id: [0x002D117D]
I do. But I am not yet satisfied that you are the one for the task ahead.

Id: [0x002D117E]
Or perhaps a more pious soul in need of charity will reward you with a lesson.

Id: [0x002D117F]
How great is the burden of learning for one so unworthy. But I see that no amount of instruction in the Lord's words will save your soul. Come.

Id: [0x002D1180]
Perhaps you should try again? Speak his story. In order.

Id: [0x002D1181]
Has His light brought illumination to your darkness? Speak His story.

Id: [0x002D1182]
Do you have a moment to speak of our Lord and savior? Jesus, the light of the world? For a coin I will tell you his story.

Id: [0x002D1183]
You honor the Lord's great deeds with your charity.

Id: [0x002D1184]
Hush! Your prattling offends God's ears.

Id: [0x002D1185]
Was God's lesson instructive?

Id: [0x002D1186]
Yet through our Lord we may achieve life everlasting in His glorious presence. Perhaps you missed that detail.

Id: [0x002D1187]
Very well. As much as you can carry.

Id: [0x002D1188]
At his house, by the west gate. You may find something there.

Id: [0x002D1189]
You may remove the organs of state, the cancer will remain.

Id: [0x002D118A]
I would return him to you myself if I knew where they were holding him. But Fulke's treachery has blindsided me as well.

Id: [0x002D118B]
To protect your people, you must sheathe your hand in an iron glove.

Id: [0x002D118C]
Ah. You peer through the veil, but you do not see clearly.

Id: [0x002D118D]
Good. Find me at the ale-house when you're done. And try not to scare the piss from any of them.

Id: [0x002D118E]
For me? O, thank you!

Id: [0x002D118F]
And I wriggle out of it like a slippery eel. Why are you following me?

Id: [0x002D1190]
Keep your sticky beak out of our business.

Id: [0x002D1191]
Us? Working for The Quill? Shows what you know.

Id: [0x002D1192]
O! It's you again!

Id: [0x002D1193]
Fruit don't feed a growing boy. Do you have any chicken?

Id: [0x002D1194]
How little you know.

Id: [0x002D1195]
No more running. Wincestre must see your crime!

Id: [0x002D1196]
The bishop is dead, that's certain. And if the bishop was The Seax, The Seax is dead. A transitive property of mortality, you see?

Id: [0x002D1197]
All in good time. A witan has been called to deal with our dead bishop. When this business is done, Aelfred will shower you with silver.

Id: [0x002D1198]
Whether you find or make a corpse, meet me at the witan with your report.

Id: [0x002D1199]
Do you not see I am in prayer?

Id: [0x002D119A]
Have you no shame? Leave me.

Id: [0x002D119B]
I am his loyal sister, and I tell you he is dead. You hear me? Dead!

Id: [0x002D119C]
God will smite you!

Id: [0x002D119D]
Barely. But can you still smell the burned flesh? It's rife across the whole graveyard.

Id: [0x002D119E]
You would dare speak to me? When my poor brother Ealhferth lies cold in his shroud?

Id: [0x002D119F]
I will not tell you any more. Guards!

Id: [0x002D11A0]
How did you … no … I--

Id: [0x002D11A1]
Alright, alright. Have your way. It won't do you any good.

Id: [0x002D11A2]
Then your people came. And God fixed his stout eye as they slit her throat for a copper ring.

Id: [0x002D11A3]
Take this key to the ruins beneath the bishop's house. You may find answers there.

Id: [0x002D11A6]
That you did. But do not mistake necessity for friendship.

Id: [0x002D11A7]
Here is the only silver fit for one of your dragon-boats. A reminder of Christ's sacrifice and our charity.

Id: [0x002D11A9]
Come crawling back, have you?

Id: [0x002D11AB]
You are the worst of the Aesir, a coddled old clod.

Id: [0x002D11AF]
Good. Now remember … it is not me you are flyting. I am but a conduit for his words.

Id: [0x002D11B0]
The most cutting of flyts from my mouth you'll not hear.

Id: [0x002D11B1]
Your body is withered, your garments absurd.

Id: [0x002D11B2]
Your visage is ghastly, I'm cowed by your stink.

Id: [0x002D11B3]
I should like to write more, but you're not worth the ink.

Id: [0x002D11B4]
Very fine work. As an impartial observer, I must say you won.

Id: [0x002D11B5]
So take what you've earned now and hurry away.

Id: [0x002D11B6]
Your pitiful flyting has left me quite cold.

Id: [0x002D11B7]
So leave here with speed, once you've paid me your gold.

Id: [0x002D11B8]
Good day. What is your name?

Id: [0x002D11B9]
And are you a flyter?

Id: [0x002D11BA]
If you wish to flyt, I will translate and relay his verses.

Id: [0x002D11BB]
I stand here on behalf of the Lady Ellette of Colchester, famed Mistress of the Flyt. Do you seek an audience?

Id: [0x002D11BC]
Based on your appearance, I am thoroughly unsurprised.

Id: [0x002D11BD]
Nevertheless, do you wish to challenge her?

Id: [0x002D11BE]
Once more, you seek an audience with milady?

Id: [0x002D11BF]
O, pity this poor little chirpless bird. I will do my best not to harm you too badly this time.

Id: [0x002D11C0]
I'll take your wager before you begin.

Id: [0x002D11C1]
Take your winnings. You have earned them.

Id: [0x002D11C2]
My heart weeps for you, and your frailty of mind.

Id: [0x002D11C3]
I do hope you'll come and try again someday.

Id: [0x002D11C4]
Perhaps you can swing that wee axe on your belt, but I doubt you've much talent for speech.

Id: [0x002D11C5]
I'll be sure to spread word of your failure across England.

Id: [0x002D11C6]
And do you like to flyt?

Id: [0x002D11C7]
Well, listen! Here, these folk aren't impressed by the speed of your thinking.

Id: [0x002D11C8]
Eivor! Good to see you! Will you drink with us?

Id: [0x002D11C9]
Your face is a wreck, you're a blight on the Norse.

Id: [0x002D11CA]
Awful! Terrible! I knew just by looking at you, you couldn't hold your mead.

Id: [0x002D11CB]
Leave and come back when you're ready to drink and do some proper flyting.

Id: [0x002D11CC]
Do not tarry! Your death by flyting awaits! Fergal will claim another sorry soul!

Id: [0x002D11CD]
Fergal the Faceless has silenced doubters before. Will you challenge him?

Id: [0x002D11CE]
You are right to be afraid. You may return to me, should you ever wish to face death by flyting.

Id: [0x002D11CF]
This key unlocks Fergal's lair, which you see now before you!

Id: [0x002D11D0]
Go! Go now. And God be with you.

Id: [0x002D11D1]
You're probably too scared to even face me, now that I think about it!

Id: [0x002D11D2]
Yes, obviously! I said you're probably too scared to face me!

Id: [0x002D11D3]
I'm very brave, my flyting is grave. I'm not a knave, and it's victory that I really crave.

Id: [0x002D11D4]
Your tongue is fat, you're a sprat, you whine like a little brat, and we are in a spat!

Id: [0x002D11D5]
Let me show you my skills and then you I shall kill … dead, with my … mm … my skill.

Id: [0x002D11D6]
You … well … I … just one moment!

Id: [0x002D11D7]
No! You get ready! The killing blow is … it's coming! It's…

Id: [0x002D11D8]
In this way, I am wise. Perhaps you will learn better through flyting? I will challenge you.

Id: [0x002D11D9]
Interested in flyting, then, that I might describe your folly in verse?

Id: [0x002D11DA]
So sad to see how little you've learned from your losses. Will you flyt again?

Id: [0x002D11DC]
It's a shame you're so calloused by warfare and pain.<LF>That you'll joke about death and treat life with disdain.

Id: [0x002D11DE]
Yes, your avarice means that you'll just never see.<LF>That this war will not grant immortality.

Id: [0x002D11DF]
Enough! I have heard more than my fill of your cruelty.

Id: [0x002D11E0]
Take your winnings. May spending them bring you fleeting joy.

Id: [0x002D11E1]
Come back when you've learned to speak.

Id: [0x002D11E2]
You there below, with your body so wee!<LF>Do you think that you'll ever be up here like me?

Id: [0x002D11E3]
Will you flyt against me and try testing your luck?

Id: [0x002D11E4]
Ah! It's you again!

Id: [0x002D11E5]
Very good! Will you challenge me?

Id: [0x002D11E6]
And my height goes to show how above you I stand…

Id: [0x002D11E7]
You've earned your winnings. You're a mighty little midge!

Id: [0x002D11E8]
I knew it. Talent as tiny as you, barely visible to my eye.

Id: [0x002D11E9]
Not bad! But what will you wager?

Id: [0x002D11ED]
You're a fat-headed fool, and a puny god!

Id: [0x002D11F1]
Good. And how much will you wager?

Id: [0x002D11F2]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002D11F3]
Your clumsy flyting is the real bore here.

Id: [0x002D11F4]
Back for more, eh? Must have an appetite for punishment.

Id: [0x002D11F5]
Do you enjoy flyting? Lobbing insults at one another?

Id: [0x002D11F6]
Then I challenge you. But be warned, this flyting is like none you have ever known.

Id: [0x002D11F8]
I stand here in awe at the charm of your face.

Id: [0x002D11F9]
You've such a great talent for flyting and rhyme.

Id: [0x002D11FA]
O, what a shame. I'm terribly sorry to take your earnings. Better luck next time?

Id: [0x002D11FB]
You there! You!

Id: [0x002D11FC]
Ah! It's you again! Such humility to return after a loss.

Id: [0x002D11FD]
Fine. Do you wish to flyt against me?

Id: [0x002D11FE]
Fair, fair. Return if you change your mind!

Id: [0x002D11FF]
Come on, you can do better than that!

Id: [0x002D1200]
Happy returns after a sorry loss. Do you want to try again? Give me your best!

Id: [0x002D1201]
You understand.

Id: [0x002D1202]
Come back when you do! For now, fly away little sparrow!

Id: [0x002D1203]
O, you think you can scare me? I am tougher than you!

Id: [0x002D1204]
You think you're good with words, eh? How about your fists?

Id: [0x002D1205]
Mm, yes. I cannot help but wonder: is your flyting as striking as you?

Id: [0x002D1206]
If you fancy a round, then approach and come speak.<LF>If you're lustful for verse, then I've got what you seek.

Id: [0x002D1207]
Perfect. Would you like to make it …interesting?

Id: [0x002D1208]
Pity. Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002D1209]
Thank you. Are we ready?

Id: [0x002D120A]
What know you of the power of flyts to seduce?<LF>Are you even aware that they have such a use?

Id: [0x002D120B]
See, your weapon lies not in your belt, but your head.

Id: [0x002D120C]
On your every word, I can say that I'm hung.

Id: [0x002D120E]
So what do you say? Shall we find somewhere and exchange a little more than words?

Id: [0x002D120F]
But this sort of thing happens to everyone, from time to time. Take a rest and return when you're feeling better.

Id: [0x002D1210]
Good. If you enjoyed my flyting, you'll be thrilled by what else a skilled mouth can do.

Id: [0x002D1211]
Pebbles were once bedrock. As were you.

Id: [0x002D1212]
Why would you ask such a question at such a time as this?

Id: [0x002D1213]
For Hretha, Eostre, and Saetere! I served the true gods! The old ones! To be killed by you holds honor! Killing holds all glory!

Id: [0x002D1218]
Recovered, thank you! And with some beautiful scars to show it.

Id: [0x002D1219]
Camp leader is up top. You can't miss him.

Id: [0x002D121A]
She'll be deep in the fog of the Fenlands by now. Find her longship. That's your best bet.

Id: [0x002D121B]
I know what you must think.

Id: [0x002D121C]
Thank you, Soma. And you as well, Sunbeam.

Id: [0x002D121D]
I'd tell you Birna was Loki in disguise if she had a scrap of subtlety in her.

Id: [0x002D121E]
That's well spotted, yes. I like to see variety in the company I keep.

Id: [0x002D121F]
And you are Eivor, Sunbeam. You cut through the fog like the sun burns through ice.

Id: [0x002D1221]
Let the wind from your lungs breathe life back into my city.

Id: [0x002D1222]
My warriors will distract the Saxon forces at the gate. You and I will find the priest.

Id: [0x002D1223]
You know, I would much prefer a more straightforward approach. But for you, I'll try something new.

Id: [0x002D1224]
Painful truths are easy to bear when you can laugh, you see? Delight in the face of suffering is an act of rebellion.

Id: [0x002D1225]
Fighting beside you should bring a thrill. Happy I can see it up close.

Id: [0x002D1226]
Remember, you don't need to kill him. Have fun. I'll be planning our next move in the longhouse.

Id: [0x002D1227]
Did you? It was stolen from my workshop not long ago.

Id: [0x002D1228]
I've never painted any longship yellow beyond a few small touches. It's expensive. I know of no such letter.

Id: [0x002D1229]
We're done here. And it'd be good for your health to take a walk, away from me.

Id: [0x002D122A]
You may not understand. But Soma does. She knows the gods have a plan for me and that following it is worth any risk.

Id: [0x002D122B]
Was it yellow? I don't recall. You could ask Lif. He's our shipmaster.

Id: [0x002D122C]
You return.

Id: [0x002D122D]
I have this for you. Keep it, knowing you have my highest respect, regard, and trust. My army is yours should you need it.

Id: [0x002D122E]
We came to a sort of … understanding. It may be best if she tells you herself.

Id: [0x002D122F]
So I've decided I'm of better use elsewhere. With you, in your crew!

Id: [0x002D1230]
And sail and raid with you. If you'll have me. And look at this … who wouldn't?

Id: [0x002D1231]
Do not think I blame you. I held the blade. The decision was my own. Now I must explain myself to my people.

Id: [0x002D1232]
I was on my way to Scarborough. If you find my hammer, bring it to me there.

Id: [0x002D1233]
The Yuletide massacre, I remember. What brings you here?

Id: [0x002D1234]
The oldest son of Ragnar Lothbrok, so he says. What do you make of him?

Id: [0x002D1235]
He conquered East Anglia, took Northumbria for his own, and sacked Lunden. What warrior could claim more?

Id: [0x002D1236]
Then come and see! What fate do these dice hold for you?

Id: [0x002D1237]
There I will weave a tale of friendship and treachery.

Id: [0x002D1238]
Would you lend us your wisdom now, if possible? We are at pains to determine how to deal with the northern Picts.

Id: [0x002D1239]
A hard way to see the world. Hard, but fair.

Id: [0x002D123A]
Not yet. That is where you enter my saga. Prove this for me. Discover if Faravid has been disloyal. Then we shall talk of oaths.

Id: [0x002D123B]
Ah. And then they picked the bones left over from your feast.

Id: [0x002D123C]
A gift for us. You track them through the cave, we'll circle around back and snare any who try to slip away.

Id: [0x002D123D]
If you insist, we'll all drink some stinking wine.

Id: [0x002D123E]
Then let me change your mind. I've got a plan to win this war for good. Before the winter sets in.

Id: [0x002D1240]
Speak without guise, Eivor. Does he plot against me or no? Does he keep secrets? Give me something I can use.

Id: [0x002D1241]
Now you must choose between treason and madness. Between the serpent's fang and the bite of a rabid wolf.

Id: [0x002D1242]
No, no, he's a wily one, that man. He's got you fooled as well. You must keep digging.

Id: [0x002D1243]
This'll be fun. You can't take us all on!

Id: [0x002D1245]
You've done it! We must hurry.

Id: [0x002D1246]
Ah! Here you see? Spoils of war. Mine. Stolen from me!

Id: [0x002D1247]
You have a meeting with Faravid. Isn't that right?

Id: [0x002D1248]
You made it, come have a drink.

Id: [0x002D1249]
I offered you enough mead to best me. No excuses!

Id: [0x002D124A]
Wait. A favor I must ask of you. Make no mention that Halfdan is ignorant of our plans. It's better this way.

Id: [0x002D124B]
I'll bother who I please, after I brick your face to the brains.

Id: [0x002D124C]
I'll meet you at Stenwege.

Id: [0x002D124D]
Faravid is Halfdan's man. So are the Hemmings of Snotinghamscire, as are we here in Jorvik. But not you.

Id: [0x002D124E]
For whom are you fighting, truly?

Id: [0x002D124F]
We did wrong to follow Ulf and would make things right by following you this day.

Id: [0x002D1250]
Easy for you. Nobody's poisoning your damn wine.

Id: [0x002D1251]
No, you keep it. Gifting him a goblet from the spoils of battle was a ritual between Halfdan and I. This one should be yours.

Id: [0x002D1252]
I should demand an apology for that. But there is no need. Soon I shall be long gone. Far away across the whale-road, where the fates guide me.

Id: [0x002D1253]
And now I can take from you anything I want … your memories, your skills, your secrets. They're all mine…

Id: [0x002D1254]
A quiet place to find an end. I almost envy you.

Id: [0x002D1255]
Please enjoy your stay! Remember, all garbage must be packed out. And please water the plants once a day.

Id: [0x002D1256]
Her motives are difficult to fathom. But that can come later. Let's find your brother first.

Id: [0x002D1257]
Come, I will introduce you. And we'll hear the full tale together.

Id: [0x002D1258]
Ah, but your brother is … someone special. Important. And I want him to see that. I hope to show it to him.

Id: [0x002D1259]
Do you have ears in every church, abbey, and cathedral in Cent? Because I do. And I will find her.

Id: [0x002D125A]
I am not done playing with these Christians yet. I will see you in Folcanstan.

Id: [0x002D125B]
Get away with you.

Id: [0x002D125C]
You have fine hair. It shimmers like … woven silk.

Id: [0x002D125D]
Hm. Haven't seen him in years. Probably dead drunk, or just dead in a ditch. Why do you think they called him legless?

Id: [0x002D125E]
I don't know you, so why would you approach me?

Id: [0x002D125F]
I have no time for your twittering.

Id: [0x002D1260]
You trying to catch flies, or would you ask something of me?

Id: [0x002D1261]
I'm in no mood for wind-belching. So choose your words well.

Id: [0x002D1262]
If you say so.

Id: [0x002D1264]
Enough! Your word-mangles are making my hair ache!

Id: [0x002D1265]
When I have Tedmund's fealty, you shall have Fulke. Now go. I will rustle up a small rescue party.

Id: [0x002D1266]
Indeed. This brings to mind a story, perhaps you've heard of it? The scorpion and the frog.

Id: [0x002D1267]
How many of your clan know the true circumstances of Sigurd's absence?

Id: [0x002D1268]
You see my point. A leader must know when to speak and when to stay silent, for silence is not always a lie.

Id: [0x002D1269]
I'll kill you before I let you take this fortress.

Id: [0x002D126A]
I shit on you! You and your toy gods! I will not bow to you like some puppet lord. I would rather die.

Id: [0x002D126B]
It was good to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you against the pox-dogs of Wessex. May our friendship endure.

Id: [0x002D126C]
Of course you have. Isn't that the way of this ugly world?

Id: [0x002D126D]
You will never find him. Not 'til I have had my fill.

Id: [0x002D126E]
You could if you wish. My father was an architect, a builder of wonders. The Great Mosque of Samarra, his masterpiece.

Id: [0x002D126F]
A subtle blade is needed here. Let not your fury drive you to your jarl. Your death will not help him.

Id: [0x002D1271]
Shergar? You mistake me, for I am Ealdorman Tedmund.

Id: [0x002D1272]
Rascally old bastard. Has some tales about you!

Id: [0x002D1273]
Then Lady Eadwyn's soldiers swept in. A fight broke out. Your brother and the tanned fella got away.

Id: [0x002D1274]
Hm. What's it worth to ye to find out?

Id: [0x002D1275]
Thank you kindly. Your brother and his friend jumped through that window and ran for the river.

Id: [0x002D1276]
You're right, you are. Your brother and his friend jumped through that window there, and scampered off towards the river.

Id: [0x002D1277]
It's not my place to lead your brother about like a bridled mare.

Id: [0x002D1278]
Not if we act soon. She dragged her prisoners to the longhouse. With you here, we can mount a surprise strike.

Id: [0x002D1279]
Good Lord, you fight well. Thank you for that.

Id: [0x002D127A]
I was desperate to fight. You should have freed me!

Id: [0x002D127B]
Well met.

Id: [0x002D127C]
Off again, Eivor. You and I, with blades drawn and hearts ablaze!

Id: [0x002D127D]
No, it's even better! You cannot imagine what discoveries await.

Id: [0x002D127E]
You on the right, me on the left, we leapt and struck!

Id: [0x002D127F]
When the time is right, I will.

Id: [0x002D1280]
This fever will break once you know the whole truth. I promise.

Id: [0x002D1281]
Bless you all. Thanks to you, I live to pay Lady Eadwyn back in blood.

Id: [0x002D1282]
We're told you know of a holy woman. Fulke. Where is she now?

Id: [0x002D1283]
We thegns will raise a fyrd and join with you to take down Eadwyn. Whatever it takes.

Id: [0x002D1284]
And you, and your brother, are you still with me?

Id: [0x002D1285]
Where is your brother and the odd fellow?

Id: [0x002D1286]
Ah, there's a notion. You could chip away at her flag-bearers if you see them, and defend my fyrd if any are in strife.

Id: [0x002D1287]
We stole some of her supplies here. If you find any other stores like this, destroy them.

Id: [0x002D1288]
You had no real cause to frighten me. I'd'a told you where they'd gone, if you'd done me some sweet talk.

Id: [0x002D1289]
Eadwyn's soldiers've got us in a tough spot. We're grateful for any help you can give.

Id: [0x002D128A]
That was a near-run thing. Thanks for helping us out.

Id: [0x002D128C]
Ah! You've timed things well. The holy woman Fulke is close by.

Id: [0x002D128D]
I wish to speak to her! Me, your jarl! That alone is reason enough!

Id: [0x002D128E]
You make a fine point. Let me pray on this.

Id: [0x002D128F]
Are you sent by the angels of Saklas? Or the Self-Begotten One above?

Id: [0x002D1290]
And you fascinate me more with each passing moment.

Id: [0x002D1291]
The Saga Stone is hidden away in the care of my acolyte. Are you ready to go see it?

Id: [0x002D1292]
You may find the stone more interesting than you expect.

Id: [0x002D1293]
That is not for you to decide!

Id: [0x002D1294]
I am your jarl, and I have sight and wisdom well beyond what you know.

Id: [0x002D1295]
You want to settle things with Basim, you call a holmgang.

Id: [0x002D1296]
Else you follow me. You listen to me. You do as I ask.

Id: [0x002D1297]
Your father knew it.

Id: [0x002D1298]
You move with the wrath of Odin, but you do not have his wisdom.

Id: [0x002D1299]
This quarrel with your brother is something to behold. Has it always been so heated?

Id: [0x002D129A]
Go on then. Your master awaits.

Id: [0x002D129C]
My difference is what is at stake here. My difference is all that matters.

Id: [0x002D129D]
You have a brusque way of ending an argument.

Id: [0x002D129E]
I'm with you!

Id: [0x002D129F]
At Saint Albanes, your brother claimed kinship with the gods.

Id: [0x002D12A0]
I'll ask more simply. Could your brother be descended of the gods? Or could he be a god himself?

Id: [0x002D12A1]
O, and … your friends were asking after you. They're busy searching for something.

Id: [0x002D12A2]
Eivor. I am more than I appear to be. So much more.

Id: [0x002D12AC]
If you need an axe, I am standing right here.

Id: [0x002D12AD]
If you need an axe, I am standing right here.

Id: [0x002D12AE]
Many from Norway find the trip dizzying, but fortunately, you have me to guide you. I know the land better than my own son.

Id: [0x002D12B1]
My son. Nesting with the Picts north of Hadrian's Wall. Who knows what schemes they are hatching…

Id: [0x002D12B2]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x002D12B3]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x002D12B5]
"Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."

Id: [0x002D12BA]
It just may work. Or better yet, I can get your crosier back.

Id: [0x002D12BB]
It just may work. Or better yet, I can get your crosier back.

Id: [0x002D12BD]
…or the sort of people they might send to spy on me.

Id: [0x002D12C0]
Of course, of course, a tour. Follow me.

Id: [0x002D12C1]
You said something about a tour.

Id: [0x002D12C2]
You said something about a tour.

Id: [0x002D12CA]
Eivor, come! Stand here and look out over the fjords. Hold my hand, there you go.

Id: [0x002D12CD]
Whaa! I have never been so high.

Id: [0x002D12CE]
Your father brought me here long ago, when we were just nineteen winters. Together we stacked stones into cairns.

Id: [0x002D12CF]
These?

Id: [0x002D12D0]
Yes. Think of this as a test of mind and wit. Stack the cairn stones high and wide, into any shape you like.

Id: [0x002D12D1]
How do I win?

Id: [0x002D12D2]
You win by playing, and a quiet mind is your reward. Let the air and nature's beauty soothe you.

Id: [0x002D12D3]
So go on. Try it yourself.

Id: [0x002D12DB]
I am here, I am here.

Id: [0x002D12DC]
Look. I made this myself, my tallest cairn yet.

Id: [0x002D12DD]
Ah, yes. Your mother said you had taken swiftly to the stack-of-stones. This is impressive.

Id: [0x002D12DE]
And it can stand hard against the winds as well. Watch!

Id: [0x002D12DF]
(blow)

Id: [0x002D12E0]
[laugh]A burst of blue-air that blows to rival Njord's noisy belches! Well made, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D12E1]
But know this, height is not the only trait of a cairn's beauty. Shape, balance, expression are key. Seek a variety of these.

Id: [0x002D12E2]
Let your only goal in this task be to surpass your own best creation.

Id: [0x002D1840]
Hysing.

Id: [0x002D1842]
What else does he say?

Id: [0x002D1849]
"Only what he wants to hear", hm? I have an idea that could help … if you let me.

Id: [0x002D184A]
"Only what he wants to hear", hm? I have an idea that could help … if you let me.

Id: [0x002D184F]
He wants to thank Hysing for his loyalty to the crown.

Id: [0x002D1850]
He wants to thank Hysing for his loyalty to the crown.

Id: [0x002D1852]
Come, Father, this way!

Id: [0x002D1854]
Sigurd, can I have that stone?

Id: [0x002D1855]
No, I need it for my tower.

Id: [0x002D1865]
Ah…

Id: [0x002D1866]
Worked on some new things for you.

Id: [0x002D1867]
You are quite good at this, these cairns. Better than me, that I admit.

Id: [0x002D1868]
Yes.

Id: [0x002D1869]
This one is your masterpiece. A monument to the gods. Now bask in their glory and receive their honor.

Id: [0x002D186A]
Well…

Id: [0x002D187A]
It is a good deal and greater news. Thank you. You may leave the king in my care now.

Id: [0x002D187B]
And they agree to pay a daily tribute of food and other goods in exchange for free passage through your lands.

Id: [0x002D187C]
And they agree to pay a daily tribute of food and other goods in exchange for free passage through your lands.

Id: [0x002D187E]
This will only lead to further delusion.

Id: [0x002D1880]
You will know at least that he eats every day. And maybe, someday, the fog will lift.

Id: [0x002D1881]
You will know at least that he eats every day. And maybe, someday, the fog will lift.

Id: [0x002D1899]
It does not matter what you tell me is real. This is what I believe. I believe Alfred has sold us out to the Picts!

Id: [0x002D189B]
What is real may not be as pleasant as a fantasy, but you have people in this world who honor you.

Id: [0x002D189C]
What is real may not be as pleasant as a fantasy, but you have people in this world who honor you.

Id: [0x002D189F]
You betrayed your nation and your people! I denounce and dethrone you!

Id: [0x002D18A2]
The moment you build my forge, I will get it blazing and start my work.

Id: [0x002D18A5]
Farewell, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D18A6]
So long.

Id: [0x002D18A7]
That be all?

Id: [0x002D18A8]
You done?

Id: [0x002D18A9]
Have a good look.

Id: [0x002D18AA]
Here's everything.

Id: [0x002D18AB]
But of course, no shop, no tattoos. Build something for us when you can and then we'll get working.

Id: [0x002D18AC]
But first, please take some time to build a workshop for me. I would rather not tattoo you in the longhouse.

Id: [0x002D18AD]
But I cannot do much of anything if I don't have a place to work. If you can build a place for me, I can get started right away.

Id: [0x002D18AE]
But for the moment, I'm a little stuck. If you could build me a stable, I can set up shop.

Id: [0x002D18AF]
If you want access to my maps, I need access to a workshop. If you can build me something, I'd appreciate it.

Id: [0x002D18B0]
Got nothing for you, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x002D18B1]
Come back a little later. Haven't got anything right now.

Id: [0x002D18BA]
What are you looking for today?

Id: [0x002D18BB]
Ready to make some changes to your longboat?

Id: [0x002D18BC]
What can I get for you?

Id: [0x002D18BD]
Nothing else for you today?

Id: [0x002D18BE]
That it?

Id: [0x002D18BF]
Enough for today?

Id: [0x002D18C0]
Don't be a stranger!

Id: [0x002D18C1]
Farewell, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D18C2]
Goodbye, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D18C3]
Until next we meet!

Id: [0x002D18C4]
I thought you'd like that.

Id: [0x002D18C5]
A good addition to any ship.

Id: [0x002D18C6]
Good craftsmanship on that one.

Id: [0x002D18C7]
I brought that in just for you.

Id: [0x002D18C8]
A quality piece if do say so myself!

Id: [0x002D18C9]
I can see this fitting nicely on your longboat!

Id: [0x002D18CA]
Whatever you need for your longship, my husband and I are happy to help. We have quite an eye for these things.

Id: [0x002D18CB]
I have some new pieces to show you.

Id: [0x002D18CC]
I just got in new stock.

Id: [0x002D18CD]
We've been working very hard on some new pieces.

Id: [0x002D18CE]
Make sure you look at the new items I've got in stock.

Id: [0x002D18CF]
Look at the new stock I've brought in.

Id: [0x002D18D0]
You've a good eye for quality!

Id: [0x002D18D1]
A good purchase, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D18D2]
Good! I knew you'd like it!

Id: [0x002D18D3]
This will make others jealous of your ship!

Id: [0x002D18D4]
You've done well with this one!

Id: [0x002D18D5]
This comes with the Gudmund Oath of Durability!

Id: [0x002D18DF]
But right now, we're more concerned with you building us a place to do our work. Get on that soon, won't you?

Id: [0x002D18E0]
Got something new for you.

Id: [0x002D18E1]
Happy to say I've refreshed my stocks.

Id: [0x002D18E5]
I guess they had to work with what they had.

Id: [0x002D18E6]
I guess they had to work with what they had.

Id: [0x002D18E7]
This is the city of Lunden, first built by the Romans during ancient times. We have not seen builders like that since.

Id: [0x002D18E8]
That said, though, I can't do much until you build me a place to work. It won't do tanning hides on makeshift tables and dirt.

Id: [0x002D18E9]
Beautiful, beautiful. Nature is amazing.

Id: [0x002D18EA]
Impressive. Never seen anything like it.

Id: [0x002D18ED]
These are the Dover Cliffs, famous for their blue birds.

Id: [0x002D18F1]
Here is Jorvik, the Dane city of trade.

Id: [0x002D18F3]
Keep this between us, but King Alfred has a plan for Jorvik.

Id: [0x002D18F5]
Hmm.

Id: [0x002D18F6]
Hmm.

Id: [0x002D18F7]
I see.

Id: [0x002D18F8]
I see.

Id: [0x002D18F9]
Not bad. Keep up the good work, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D18FA]
Not now. Come back a little later.

Id: [0x002D18FB]
Mind you, that's all well and good to say, but until you build me a place to house my collection, none of it will be possible.

Id: [0x002D18FE]
This is Hadrian's Wall. Our last line of defense against the barbarous Picts.

Id: [0x002D1900]
It is a line of sorts.

Id: [0x002D1901]
It is a line of sorts.

Id: [0x002D1902]
Excited to say I've got something new in my stocks.

Id: [0x002D1904]
But if I'm being honest, we can't do a thing until we've got a place to work. If you've got time, we'd love it if you could build something.

Id: [0x002D1906]
Sorry, Eivor. Can't take anything right now. Come back later.

Id: [0x002D190F]
Here, we have only the most unusual, exotic and enticing items from around the world, provided by my guild, the Thousand Eyes.

Id: [0x002D1911]
Where is King Alfred?

Id: [0x002D1912]
Those honorless Picts! They have taken the king! We must seek them north of Hadrian's Wall!

Id: [0x002D1916]
At the end of our tour is Wincestre, the heart of Wessex, where--

Id: [0x002D1917]
So long, farewell!

Id: [0x002D1918]
Goodbye for now!

Id: [0x002D1919]
See you later!

Id: [0x002D191A]
You go on, I'll still be here.

Id: [0x002D191B]
Go with your gods!

Id: [0x002D191C]
You need to build some barracks. Otherwise, these raiders are going to get soft. And we can't have that.

Id: [0x002D1938]
Yes, yes, I see the bricks of this verse. Fight … night … brawl … Valhall… No, Odin's hall. [inspired]Get me my quill!

No, I cannot leave Petra alone.

Id: [0x002D193D]
No, I cannot leave Petra alone.

Id: [0x002D1941]
I'll wait here. Don't be long.

Id: [0x002D1942]
What were we saying?

Id: [0x002D1944]
Hold a moment. I'll be back soon.

Id: [0x002D1945]
Hold a moment. I'll be back soon.

Id: [0x002D1946]
We should get going.

Id: [0x002D1949]
Father told me, but I cannot play too often with Sigurd. He always steals my stones and calls me troll-tooth.

Id: [0x002D194A]
I can think of one way to fluster him. Use all of these stones for your next cairn. He'll have none for himself.

Id: [0x002D194B]
I could build the largest cairn he has ever seen. He would be so jealous.

Id: [0x002D194C]
Take these. Make him smile.

Id: [0x002D194D]
And did your father mention Gunnar's arm ring?

Id: [0x002D194E]
Yes!

Id: [0x002D194F]
No. Not that I remember.

Id: [0x002D1950]
Speak with your father tonight. He has a special task for you.

Id: [0x002D1951]
(scream)

Id: [0x002D1952]
Am I what?

Id: [0x002D1953]
What you just said. Was it about my father?

Id: [0x002D1954]
I said nothing. We have been silent since we came here.

Id: [0x002D1955]
Liar. You did, just now. As plain as you're talking now.

Id: [0x002D1956]
You are mad. What did I say?

Id: [0x002D1957]
A coward believes he will live unto old age if he stays clear of strife, but old age will wither him fast, though he be untouched by spears.

Id: [0x002D1958]
I said nothing of the sort, troll-tooth! That is the All-Father whispering into your big head.

Id: [0x002D195A]
What are you doing all the way up here?

Id: [0x002D195B]
What are you doing all the way up here?

Id: [0x002D195D]
He missed, the stranger missed! That could have been Esobert's mangled noggin.

Id: [0x002D195E]
She missed, the stranger missed! That could have been Esobert's mangled noggin.

Id: [0x002D195F]
What a terrible show, boo, boo…!

Id: [0x002D1966]
I have only just begun to walk in Aelfred's footsteps. But please read my scribbles. Enlighten yourself about our great king.

Id: [0x002D1968]
They call me Mildburg the Miracle Legs!

Id: [0x002D1973]
You seem agitated.

Id: [0x002D1974]
You seem agitated.

Id: [0x002D1975]
What gave it away? The fact that I had to debase myself pissing in this swindler's pond? Or the angry shouting?

Id: [0x002D1977]
This man has something of yours?

Id: [0x002D1978]
This man has something of yours?

Id: [0x002D197A]
Wolves!

Id: [0x002D197D]
And know this. If you ever return, you'll be punished for your crimes. Come, Griseld, I shall be your rock now.

Id: [0x002D197E]
An elaborate ruse for so simple a problem.

Id: [0x002D1980]
Well? Was it nothing but driftwood?

Id: [0x002D1985]
Come on, Eivor! Can't you run any quicker?

Id: [0x002D1987]
I can't! You won't understand, even if I do! Just trust me!

Id: [0x002D1988]
Knud, you have to tell me what has happened.

What stories do you mean?

Life is not a story, Tove. It is fractured shout, unguided by verse. Most of us meet untidy ends.

When we tell stories, the old and wise, they have this calm about them. They know when their end has come, and they are ready.

Id: [0x002D1999]
Svend wasn't ready.

Id: [0x002D199A]
When you can. Thank you.

Id: [0x002D19A8]
Now come! I believe I know where we will find Wallace.

Id: [0x002D19AF]
And here I am! Freshly rested and ready to work.

Id: [0x002D19BB]
Maybe we could do it again. Without the mushrooms?

Id: [0x002D19BF]
Maybe so. But don't scoff at dreams. They are often worth more than our waking hours.

Id: [0x002D19C0]

Please, bring me up to the bridge. I need some treatment, some medicine…

Id: [0x002D19FA]
Between you and me, I've been dying to murder this bastard for ages. Fenton was a royal pain in my arse.

Id: [0x002D19FC]
Betrayal burns your blood, Raven-Feeder. Brother against brother, till wolves devour the sky.

Id: [0x002D19FD]
Beneath the Sacred City, where panthers prowl. He will find what stole the Maiden's Blush and begin the final journey.

Speaking of payment, where is my silver?

Troubles of the heart?

I think I know what to say.

I think I know what to say.

Id: [0x002D1A23]
Let's hear it then.

Id: [0x002D1A24]
Trapped in the wyrd, bound for glory. What will you give for its tarnished hue? Who will die?

Give me a moment, I will come up with something.

Those words about my ale, sung by a honey-voiced angel! Tell me, which of you sang such sweet words to me?

Id: [0x002D1A37]
Swarthy he comes. Eternal yonder sea. Strike his sword in the land.

Id: [0x002D1A38]
And we'll make it interesting. Put your silver where your mouth is. What say you?

Id: [0x002D1A40]
I wish to repay you, beautiful stranger … let's warm up at my hearth. Or better yet, let's do more than that.

Id: [0x002D1A4C]
O, my. What a disappointment. I thought they were your words, Bertha…

Id: [0x002D1A4F]
Those were my words. I told her what to say. She merely sang them.

Id: [0x002D1A50]
Those were my words. I told her what to say. She merely sang them.

Id: [0x002D1A52]
I never knew you crafted such wonderful word-songs, Bertha. Come in, I want to hear more…

Id: [0x002D1A55]
She crafted those words and sang them out for you.

Id: [0x002D1A56]
She crafted those words and sang them out for you.

Id: [0x002D1A74]
Did you at least find the treasure?

Yes. Take this bracelet your father sought. By rights, it's yours.

He is bound in sleep-thorn. Free him! Free him!

Id: [0x002D1A7E]
He cuts down the stalks, waving-wild under a gibbous moon. But Christ's army will follow poor soldier to the sands and back.

Id: [0x002D1A83]
Thank you, brave traveler. We knew you would find it.

How am I going to feed my children now that my bear is dead?

Id: [0x002D1A88]
That cursed animal! Trying to kill me! I should have beaten it more while I had the chance.

Id: [0x002D1A89]
Without my bear, all I have left is my winning personality. O God, I'm doomed.

Id: [0x002D1A8A]
I saw no one. It might be that he went to find food.

Id: [0x002D1A8B]

Id: [0x002D1B1A]
My scouts reported that a few nobles have arrived for the festivities already.

Id: [0x002D1B29]
They are not expecting us. We should not meet much resistance on the way.

Id: [0x002D1B2A]
Then quietly, through the fields? It will be already too late once they see us.

Id: [0x002D1B2F]

Eivor leaps into some straw. Stares sure death right in the maw. Nary a scratch or broken bone. Children, do not try this at home.

Regard our hero. So skilled with a rod!

Eivor picks some poisoned grub. [beat]Ha! I jest of course.

Thank you, I am sure it will be … informative.

We can retrace his steps. With luck, he hasn't done anything foolish.

Id: [0x002D1B6C]
Never. That's why his absence worries me. I told you how we found him, didn't I?

Id: [0x002D1B6D]
Fated, yes. As if gifted from one guardian to another, he was bestowed on us like a … like a babe among the reeds.

Id: [0x002D1B76]
Is he prone to that sort of thing?

And next, watch Eivor fall to her certain death!

Id: [0x002D1B7F]
Eivor climbs on top of the world!

Id: [0x002D1B80]
Eivor does not share her snacks.

Id: [0x002D1B81]
Our hero's tummy now is full.

Go on, throw them off the cliff.

Id: [0x002D1B94]
My life. The fruit of my work, all gathered here, and now I lack the strength to throw it off this cliff.

Id: [0x002D1B96]
The horse did most of it. It is the only way I can send my belongings into the next world. My children will not bury it with me.

Id: [0x002D1B98]
They say they do not want it, but I know they will sell it all once my light burns out. Will you lend me your strength?

Id: [0x002D1B99]
What is all this?

Id: [0x002D1B9A]
What is all this?

If he did, he left traces.

O, no. Eivor, over here.

That leads below ground to who knows where. Let's keep our wits about us.

Take this key, and if you find yourself in Repton, seek out my quarters near the docks. There's a large tree out front.

Id: [0x002D2780]
Inside, you will find a few of my most prized items. Take them. I no longer have any need.

Greetings, bard.

That face, that scowl… yes indeed, you must be the Wolf-Kissed! Your fame and generosity are well-known to me!

Id: [0x002D280F]
Ah, Eivor of the Ravens! Have you changed your mind about living forever in song? Bit of coin for a soulful tune?

Id: [0x002D2811]
A disease that often goes unnoticed until it is too late. The whole village had it.

Id: [0x002D2816]
Frode! Write that down! The Tall One's words will be remembered!

Id: [0x002D281A]
Frode! You had better be writing these words of wisdom down!

Id: [0x002D2824]
Here, stranger. Good art should not be without reward. Take this silver as my patronage for your craft.

Id: [0x002D2828]
Enough fun and games. I should see how Oswald is doing.

Nothing a little fire cannot purge!

Id: [0x002D282F]
No pushing, Bjornsson! I'm watching you!

Id: [0x002D2831]
You have a point. Here … as promised, you cheat.

Id: [0x002D2832]
Arrows or otherwise, does it really matter?

Arrows or otherwise, does it really matter?

Id: [0x002D2834]
Ah, greetings, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D2840]
Thank you stranger. Leave, Father, leave my home and my life. [beat]Your actions have made me an orphan.

Id: [0x002D2841]
You deserve reparation. Speak your justice and I will enforce it.

Innocents will die for your ambitions. I am your ally now, but after this, I must turn back to Mercia. I have much to repent.

Id: [0x002D2844]
Perhaps I shall one day sit upon the throne of all England. King Geadric the drunken ass!

Finnr, stand tall. A light heart lifts all those around them.

Ah, Eivor. Who would not be joyous, reaving at your side?

Id: [0x002D2850]
And how do you feel about bringing sorrow to the Saxons on their holy day?

Id: [0x002D2851]
And how do you feel about bringing sorrow to the Saxons on their holy day?

Id: [0x002D2852]
It darkens my mood. I have learned some of the Christ-Lord's teachings. He preaches peace where our gods delight in battle.

Id: [0x002D2866]
I have done all I can to help King Oswald find his feet. I leave East Anglia in good hands.

Id: [0x002D2868]
No. When I heard of a mighty warrior in the west, who brings terror to the Saxons … I came to join you. If you'll have me?

Id: [0x002D286A]
Finnr! You have come far at my call, old friend.

Id: [0x002D286B]
Finnr! You have come far at my call, old friend.

You do not plan to return, then?

Long eaten. But take this instead.

And my cake?

And my cake?

Do not pout. Have a reward much more worthy of your talents.

Couldn't let her carve all the glory for herself. Ljufvina was just boasting of her heroics in Suthsexe.

Id: [0x002D28B3]
I have come to make sure my warrior-wife's enthusiasm for battle does not get her slaughtered.

Id: [0x002D28B4]
Have you ever met a woman less in need of a guardian than me, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D28B5]
You will have one, nonetheless.

Id: [0x002D28B6]
Ljufvina, my old friend! And I see you have convinced your husband to stumble southwards.

Well as ever. Better since we skinned those Order rats.

Lunden is quiet enough, and Stowe here felt the sharp stab of conscience.

Id: [0x002D28EE]
I could not let you down, Eivor. That's not what an honorable man does. So here I am, despite my reservations.

Id: [0x002D28F0]
And you, Broder. I did not think you would be here either.

Eew! [spotting Eivor and Hurrey]Careful, that Dane's back with Hurrey.

Id: [0x002D2909]
We have returned to give this dead warrior his axe back because … because why?

Id: [0x002D290B]
None. You drink. Pig speaks.

Loki's twisted threads. What trick is this?

It does not sit easy with me, warring on Saxons. But a debt is a debt, and Aelfred is no king of mine.

You did. Led by a white elk to a lost babe in the woods. A fated encounter.

Should I sit at home, eyes red and nose dripping? Brothir feasts in Odin's hall. He has gone where I hope to join him one day.

Id: [0x002D292F]
And you, Broder. I was not sure you would come.

Id: [0x002D2930]
And you, Broder. I was not sure you would come.

Id: [0x002D293A]
Hold right there, you speedy hare. No entry to you past this point without a password to anoint.

Id: [0x002D2944]
To disturb such holy revels with blood and murder … I fear God may never forgive me for this.

Id: [0x002D2945]
Aelfred still lives. And now I am twice his enemy. Give me one more fight and I will gladly make it a third!

My brooch! My brooch! Dear Heaven, I'll never get it back!

And still it breaks my heart to look upon what we have done today. Was it the right choice? I do not know. But it is done now.

Erke. You wear a furrowed brow.

You are not injured, Tewdwr?

Id: [0x002D295B]
It is done, Broder. You fought well.

Id: [0x002D295C]
It is done, Broder. You fought well.

Id: [0x002D295E]
Is this the glory you Danes seek? You can keep it. I saw Hunwald die, the light dim in his eyes. That could have been me.

Id: [0x002D2960]
Your first battle, Eluric. You fought well and with honor.

Polished the family brooch up for my niece, put it down for two seconds, and it's gone! One of the sheep must've swallowed it.

Id: [0x002D296C]
Here you all are! All my friends together! Isn't everything just perfect?

Id: [0x002D296E]
A lost cause. I'm going for a nap. If Lady runs off, follow her, would you? What she finds we'll share. [beat]The socks are all yours.

You pissing-poodle! This is all your fault. Now your thug is smashing up my livelihood.

Id: [0x002D2975]

Bandits? If you hadn't been there, I dread to think. Please, keep all the treasure. Your payment for my sweet girl's life.

Id: [0x002D2990]
Isn't she? Bramble-sharp and gentle as a kitten. Earns her keep and more besides.

Id: [0x002D2992]
Aye, she does. I will never find another friend like her. Well, goodbye. Fare safe on your travels.

Holy splinters from the cross. Alright, take it.

Id: [0x002D299D]
That belongs to Aelfred, king of all the Saxons!

Ah! I may be, [laugh]but my sixty winters have not slaked my taste for raiding. And I have the finest crew on the sea.

It'll need a washing, but my niece will be so grateful! Many thanks, stranger.

Keep that up and I'll leave you here for the wolves. [beat]Ah no, look at your leg. Is it truly broken?

Id: [0x002D2A2C]
No, sprained is all. But I'd like to see you get by without me. Couldn't even climb down a ladder without mewing like a newborn.

Well, I really enjoyed the time we've spent together, Eivor. More than enjoyed.

Id: [0x002D31D0]
What I'm trying to say here is that I … I like you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D31D1]
And I'd like to go further with you. I thought we might, you know … be together.

Id: [0x002D31D2]
Go ahead, I'm listening.

Id: [0x002D31D3]
Go ahead, I'm listening.

Id: [0x002D31D8]
I feel the same way, Petra.

Id: [0x002D31D9]
I feel the same way, Petra.

Id: [0x002D31DE]
Yes. More than anything.

Id: [0x002D31DF]
My feelings for you are impossible to ignore. I want to be with you … if you still want me.

Id: [0x002D31E0]
My feelings for you are impossible to ignore. I want to be with you … if you still want me.

Id: [0x002D31E1]
May the gods grant you better luck than I have seen!

Id: [0x002D31E3]
Your treachery ends here.

Id: [0x002D31E4]
Your treachery ends here.

Id: [0x002D31E6]
Is that how it works?

Id: [0x002D31E7]
Is that how it works?

Id: [0x002D31E9]
No, say nothing. I understand. You know how I feel about you. And that is that.

Id: [0x002D31EA]
Ah, Petra. You are a close and dear friend, but I am not--

Id: [0x002D31EB]
Ah, Petra. You are a close and dear friend, but I am not--

Id: [0x002D31ED]
I … I knew that. I was expecting that-- O, what a fool I am.

Id: [0x002D31EF]
Well. At least you know how I feel about you-- If anything…

Id: [0x002D31F0]
Sorry, Petra. But I am already with someone.

Id: [0x002D31F1]
Sorry, Petra. But I am already with someone.

Id: [0x002D31F2]
It's alright. Everything is fine! If anything, I'm flattered.

Id: [0x002D31F3]
It's alright. Everything is fine! If anything, I'm flattered.

Id: [0x002D31F5]
I am no longer with anyone. I want only you.

Id: [0x002D31F6]
I am no longer with anyone. I want only you.

Id: [0x002D31FB]
My crew is gathered down by the docks. Locals mostly. Even a couple of farmers hungry for excitement.

Id: [0x002D31FD]
How do they compare to me and Sigurd?

Id: [0x002D31FE]
How do they compare to me and Sigurd?

Id: [0x002D3200]
Is there something wrong with wanting to bake bread? The Romans baked bread. The Egyptians baked bread.

Id: [0x002D3202]
It is a fine trade. But is it your calling?

Id: [0x002D3203]
It is a fine trade. But is it your calling?

Id: [0x002D3205]
Ah, yes. The realm is safe … for now. Hej, drengr.

Id: [0x002D3206]
You can have your Wind-Blue now, in peace, old drengr.

Id: [0x002D3207]
You can have your Wind-Blue now, in peace, old drengr.

Id: [0x002D320C]
You want to fight them all at once?

Id: [0x002D320E]
Why not? Raids are the stuff of chaos itself. They need a test with no rules.

Id: [0x002D320F]
Why not? Raids are the stuff of chaos itself. They need a test with no rules.

Id: [0x002D3214]
Forgive my being forward but … I have kept too many secrets in life. I will not carry another.

Id: [0x002D3218]
Have you given any more thought to … what we spoke about?

Id: [0x002D3245]
Our work is done and daylight remains. We have earned a drink for our troubles, I think. What say you, brothers?

Id: [0x002D3246]
A drink, aye! To drown our creation in praise. A world fashioned anew from old flesh!

Id: [0x002D3247]
Do you recall the size of old Ymir when we began our work? A corpse as tall as the day is long! Spanning the abyss, Ginnungagap.

Id: [0x002D3248]
O yes, O yes. His pliant flesh, by which we made the fertile soils of the earth.

Id: [0x002D3249]
And from his blood came oceans and the seas. I remember well.

Id: [0x002D324A]
For hills and mountains, we piled his bones.

Id: [0x002D324B]
From his beard came trees, from his hair the grass.

Id: [0x002D324C]
His domed skull we opened for the blue heavens above. Crowded by clouds of brain matter.

Id: [0x002D324D]
A new world made from an old life ended! Skal, brothers! I raise my horn to you both.

Id: [0x002D324F]
Brother Odin, you are silent. Is something wrong? Is our work not worthy of praise?

Id: [0x002D3250]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002D325D]
Some coins have been taken from me.

Id: [0x002D3369]
How are you called, you bear-skins, you wolf-shirts, you tasters of blood?

Id: [0x002D336B]
They call us the shield-biters, the wall-breakers, born in battle's flood.

Id: [0x002D336C]
You called to me?

Id: [0x002D336D]
You called to me?

Id: [0x002D336F]
Soon, Alfhild, soon.

Id: [0x002D337D]
Saints preserve us! The heathens have come to slaughter us in our beds!

Id: [0x002D3383]
I am glad, Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002D3384]
I am glad, Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002D3385]
I was always him, but my faith was like a veil. I am glad you helped me lift it.

Id: [0x002D3388]
And now another education. You'll see how we Norse bands fight.

Id: [0x002D3389]
And now another education. You'll see how we Norse bands fight.

Id: [0x002D338D]
And you. Come to make your name in battle? Another corpse at my door won't matter.

Id: [0x002D338F]
A Mercian lord, whose name shall not sour my lips. He has scores of men, an army perhaps. But that will not stop me.

Id: [0x002D3397]
I have wasted so much time in pouting like a child. No more, Eivor, no more.

Id: [0x002D33A4]
Speak your name, warrior.

Id: [0x002D33A5]
Speak your name, warrior.

Id: [0x002D33A6]
Have it your way.

Id: [0x002D33A7]
Have it your way.

Id: [0x002D33A8]
Eivor running from the past, with mighty speed to flabbergast.

Id: [0x002D33AD]
I should return to Elmenham. Oswald's wedding will soon begin.

Id: [0x002D33AE]
I should return to Elmenham. Oswald's wedding will soon begin.

Id: [0x002D33B2]
Come, come, the wedding is soon to start!

Id: [0x002D33B3]
How grand!

Id: [0x002D33B4]
Then the battle ended. I feel him no longer.

Id: [0x002D33B6]
Aye. And there you'll find me, Eivor. In amongst the blood and death, Brothir at my shoulder. Until the Valkyries claim me.

Id: [0x002D33B7]
There will be other battles.

Id: [0x002D33B8]
There will be other battles.

Id: [0x002D33BE]
He's a ferocious beast!

Id: [0x002D33C1]
Fall before me!

Id: [0x002D33C3]
I will eat your bones!

Id: [0x002D33CB]
I grew tired of killing. Alfhild and I, we came here for a new start, a quiet life.

Id: [0x002D33CD]
You have the right of it. Only he wanted me to drink the berserker brew first.

Id: [0x002D33D0]
No, your words are wise. I do not want to die fighting. I want to die knowing my wife is avenged.

Id: [0x002D33D1]
But fame sailed ahead of you. This Mercian lord learned of your deeds, sought to boost his own name with your blood.

Id: [0x002D33D2]
But fame sailed ahead of you. This Mercian lord learned of your deeds, sought to boost his own name with your blood.

You shall have it. And when this is over, I trust the Raven Clan will have your axe.

Id: [0x002D33DA]
You shall have it. And when this is over, I trust the Raven Clan will have your axe.

Id: [0x002D33E0]
You there, Dane. A word, if you will?

Id: [0x002D33E2]
Those men must have heard the horn's call. The people of East Anglia have more courage than I imagined.

Hello, pig!

Hello, pig!

My thanks, Stowe. You came to my aid, when you were free to turn away.

My thanks, Stowe. You came to my aid, when you were free to turn away.

If Aelfred had his way, there would never be friendship between Norse and Saxon. You fought for peace. Be proud of that.

Id: [0x002D33F4]
Stowe is taking matters hard. You know how sensitive he is.

Id: [0x002D33F6]
His support for you has taxed him hard. I will take him back to Lunden. Maybe he will find some comfort there.

Id: [0x002D33F8]
A man of faith and stout morals. Small wonder he is tormented.

Enjoy this victory, Eivor, whatever it brings you. Only a coward thinks he'll live forever.

My very presence would make that impossible.

Id: [0x002D3403]
My very presence would make that impossible.

Id: [0x002D3407]
I used to believe in damnation for all who turned from his light. But there is a wondrous communion in friendship honored.

Id: [0x002D3409]
Your Freyja would, too.

Id: [0x002D340A]
And what of my heathen friends?

Id: [0x002D340B]

Atonement is a long and lonely path, and I must soon leave to take my first steps upon it.

Had your god taken Aelfred's side, we would not have won. So it may be that you did his work after all.

No, I am as blind as they come. However the Light Elves guide me through this realm, and I sense it.

Id: [0x002D342B]
The path is fraught with delight. Energies the Light Elves dropped. And at the end, the third paradise, Wind-Blue.

Id: [0x002D342C]
Aelfheim, you say? Have you drunk a seer's concoction?

Id: [0x002D342D]

Id: [0x002D3430]
Welcome to Aelfheim! If I had my eyes, I would show you its splendor myself!

Id: [0x002D3431]
A land of Endless Mist!

Id: [0x002D3432]
Please join me in my daily jaunt through this magical land. I am seeking the Wind-Blue. The Dark Elves pushed me out.

Id: [0x002D3434]
For what days I was given to spend with you. For each breath that carried your sweet whispers, I give thanks.

Id: [0x002D3435]
No more, your fingers in my hair. No more your arms around my waist. The days will be cold hereafter, all color dimmed.

Id: [0x002D3436]
Goodbye, my only. My heart ends with you. What is left … will go on.

Id: [0x002D3438]
You have much to learn.

Id: [0x002D3439]
You have much to learn.

Id: [0x002D343B]
I know, I know. Only a warning. Let's go inside.

Nothing. I must continue my search.

So what will you do, now that this task is done?

So what will you do, now that this task is done?

Id: [0x002D344A]
What! Wait!

What! Wait!

Id: [0x002D3471]
It's my grandfather, really, but he says the best way to learn responsibility is by working.

Id: [0x002D3472]
Besides … between you and me… I'm better at it. More of a "people person," you know?

Id: [0x002D3474]
Are you the man in charge?

Id: [0x002D3475]
Are you the man in charge?

If you are wondering what good I will bring to the settlement, you need only look to the greatest empire the world has ever known.

Id: [0x002D347C]
But you have not seen them restored to their former glory! And I can help.

Id: [0x002D347F]
Quite a name you have.

If you happen to find any distinctly Roman artifacts on your travels, bring them by. We can make something of this mess yet.

Who is it that romps on our land? Not that raving fool again?

Some weeks back, soldiers confiscated my personal wares, shall we say. Tried to confiscate me as well, but I gave them the slip.

Lose something?

Lose something?

Id: [0x002D3540]
That's enough!

Tougher than you know. Thorgils got back up after you went down. He finished the fight.

Id: [0x002D3699]
I like living in the longhouse! I feel like a jarl!

Be careful or be cursed.

Yggdrasil the World-Tree, Odin's gallows. The place where life and death are one.

Soon their resistance waned and they surrendered to Father. In his wisdom, Father sought not to rule by fear.

Id: [0x002D36EC]
He bid the locals show us their way of life, he accepted them and theirs. Their ways, their culture, their god.

Id: [0x002D36ED]
Not all our people saw eye to eye with father and some made their displeasure known. Challenged their jarl.

Id: [0x002D36EE]
Often times, Father quelled the unrest with reason, but sometimes the square was drawn and the blood of kinsman was spilled.

Id: [0x002D36EF]
You will fight me, dog.

Id: [0x002D36F3]
I once asked him why he would kill his own over the lives of these Saxons.

Id: [0x002D36F4]
He would only say, "There are no Norse or Saxons here, Son, not anymore. Not if we want to survive the ages to come."

It is a real beast, I tell you! I saw it with my own eyes. A long time ago, when I had barely a hair on my chin.

Id: [0x002D3731]
I was out whaling, painting the sea red as we dragged our quarry back to the village by its fin. A fine old gray … huge he was.

Id: [0x002D3736]
But the boat slowed down some. Then stopped, and soon started moving against the current. We were stunned into silence.

Traitor! The king won't speak to me! You cut out his tongue!

He has no tongue!

Because you cut it out!

No ale nor silver here. Whose idea was it to come to this worthless land?

Gorm comes roaring up, shouting, "Wot's all this? Who's been in my gear?" An' he stares right at Olav.

Id: [0x002D3755]
Thor's balls, you found it! Why did you take it back? You set him off again.

For too long, I stared at the sun! It blinded me to the truth. That it was you. It was you I wanted all along.

You widowed my destiny, Wolf-Kissed! You broke all my hopes!

And we could persuade them to support a new king of Wessex. [beat]I will subdue the lords.

Your young Saxons can be our eyes to the west. Better to keep their soft hands away from the conflict.

Gladly, Eivor.

That belonged to the first Christian Pope … or maybe it was a saint. It brings the blessing of their god.

Id: [0x002D3896]
A shield strap belonging to the hero Sigurth when he fought … the great beast.

Id: [0x002D3898]
That was the helmet Halfdan the Black wore when he died in battle. It will protect you and bring good crops.

It was all I could find. I sold nothing for a long time. But the weight grew too heavy, and I needed to eat … to survive.

Id: [0x002D3963]
This world is all I know, and this life all I have left. Would you take that from me?

Fishing relaxes me. When the bread is kneaded and rising, and I wish to be alone with my thoughts, I come here.

Id: [0x002D39D0]
My father loved to fish. He would take a flask of ale at the start of the day and set it at the water's edge, half submerged.

Id: [0x002D39D5]
Done? Shall we head back?

Id: [0x002D39DA]
Nice!

Id: [0x002D39DB]
You're going to make me jealous!

Id: [0x002D39DC]
That'll make a wonderful meal, I think.

Id: [0x002D39DD]
Come, let's go fishing.

Id: [0x002D39DF]
I know you're often away, but I don't mind. Honestly. Every moment counts. Even if it's sitting quietly with the fish.

Id: [0x002D39E1]
I must say, I used to like fishing alone. But now, whenever I do, I miss your presence.

Id: [0x002D39E3]
I did not take you for a fisherman.

Id: [0x002D39E4]
I did not take you for a fisherman.

Id: [0x002D39E9]
Thank you for the fishing rope, Tarben. I'll get it back to you in one piece.

Id: [0x002D39EA]

Id: [0x002D39ED]
Yes, I think it's time.

Id: [0x002D39EE]
Yes, I think it is time.

I would like to stay a little longer.

Come on…

Ah! That's a bite!

Id: [0x002D39F4]
Ah! That's a bite!

Id: [0x002D39FF]
You know, I noticed the same thing.

Id: [0x002D3A04]
It's past the little 'un's bed times, and I want to retire. Take your cake and go.

Id: [0x002D3A63]
Eivor. How are you?

Id: [0x002D3A71]
I see. Are you sure you wouldn't want to keep trying? Push through the doubt?

Id: [0x002D3A73]
I understand. And I appreciate your honesty. Now, please, go. I'd like to be alone.

Id: [0x002D3A76]
I understand. Things can be difficult but … but we can face them together.

Id: [0x002D3A77]
I should go. Let's talk again soon.

Id: [0x002D3A78]
I should go. Let's talk again soon.

You're right. What we have is worth more effort, on both our parts. I'm sorry I came with such grave tidings.

Id: [0x002D3A8A]
Eivor, darling, how nice to see you.

Id: [0x002D3A8B]
Ah, I was just thinking about you.

Id: [0x002D3A8C]
Eivor, entangled by a hardy jarlskona as she leads her army to victory and prosperity. A rather appealing match.

Id: [0x002D3A8D]
If you must.

Id: [0x002D3A8E]
I knew you were one of us. Dance with us Dane, dance!

Id: [0x002D3AC9]
Randvi! Don't let him win.

Id: [0x002D3ACB]
Of course I was. Such a long voyage. Did you do what had to be done?

Id: [0x002D3ACC]
Good.

Id: [0x002D3ACD]
Were you worried?

Id: [0x002D3ACE]
Were you worried?

Id: [0x002D3AED]
No, that cannot be right. Ask him yourself.

Id: [0x002D3AF5]
Welcome, traveler, to our lush and fertile shores!

Id: [0x002D3AF6]
Do not worry, my king! I am coming! Do not worry, my king! I am coming!

Id: [0x002D3AF9]
I am sure he is somewhere.

Id: [0x002D3AFA]
I am sure he is somewhere.

Id: [0x002D3AFC]
Where are you, my king?

Id: [0x002D3B03]
I would not think of it!

Id: [0x002D3B04]
I would not think of it!

Id: [0x002D3B07]
Tell your Pictish master that you will never take England!

Id: [0x002D3B36]
Still at war with England?

Id: [0x002D3B37]
Still at war with England?

Id: [0x002D3B3E]
That tough old fox is still hanging on. I admit I am impressed.

Id: [0x002D3B46]
The Picts have been fine subjects. King Alfred is pleased.

Id: [0x002D3B47]
The peace holds. For now.

Id: [0x002D3B48]
Looks like England is united.

Id: [0x002D3B59]
Ah. I sense the Light Elves. The luxury of their strong souls! Here they are.

Id: [0x002D3B5D]
I hail from Zealand. Joined Guthrum on his march through the swamps. But losing my eyes, they left me behind.

Id: [0x002D3B65]
Are you from here?

Id: [0x002D3B66]
Are you from here?

Id: [0x002D3B6D]
This way! It is not far.

Id: [0x002D3B70]
Loot! Beauteous loot! Hacksilver is stuffed into the Big Wolf's purse.

Id: [0x002D3B74]
If you do as you promise, the pikes of Theotford will be yours.

Id: [0x002D3B77]

Id: [0x002D3B84]
O, sweet Olav! The poor man. What then? Was he all right?

Id: [0x002D3B86]
Olav, he tries to run, but says, "I weren't stealin', I was tradin'!" But Gorm would have none of that.

Id: [0x002D3B87]
I can't bear to hear another word! Good Olav, to think he may have been hurt. Or worse.

Id: [0x002D3B88]
Elspeth, I was wondering … have you seen Hilde's brother about?

Id: [0x002D3B89]
Olav the Unlucky? Why, are you sweet on the fellow? Is that it?

Id: [0x002D3B8A]
No no, just worried about him, that's all.

Id: [0x002D3B8B]
Ah, well. I have some bad news for you, lass.

Id: [0x002D3B8F]
Its arm wrapped around the whale, pulling it down, down to the depths. And us with it! I slashed the rope, releasing the whale.

Id: [0x002D3B90]
Whales die a slow death sometimes, and often they make a last bid to escape, so I checked its bindings. And there it was! The kraken!

Id: [0x002D3B96]
Gorm, you anvil-head. Give him his due, eh? He is paying us to do nothing but wait. That is not half bad.

Id: [0x002D3B97]
I would rather be paid half as much to fight, than wait these months doing nothing but watch the river run past.

Id: [0x002D3B9A]
But Gorm's talking crystal led us here! Gorm's god-rock is never wrong!

Id: [0x002D3B9B]
Maybe someone is throwing their voice into the crystal to trick him! I saw a seer from Geatland do that once.

Id: [0x002D3B9D]
You were dreaming, Ale-blood. And do not convince me otherwise.

Id: [0x002D3B9E]
And as quickly as it came, the monster disappeared, dragging its dinner into the icy waters. Vanished completely.

Id: [0x002D3B9F]
Isle of ice! Winter there is colder than Gorm's heart. Darker too!

Id: [0x002D3BA0]
Least the lasses are warm. Ah, yes. Nothing else like that in this world.

Id: [0x002D3BAB]
Olav should know his tormentor is dead. I owe him that much.

Id: [0x002D3BAC]
Olav should know his tormentor is dead. I owe him that much.

Id: [0x002D3BB0]
Hmm … I think this is just the right amount…

Hen! Tesahsteríhen! Tshiteníhser, thí:ken ohkwá:ri![Yes! Quickly! After that honey beast!]

Please, bring us some of her favorite flowers. They look like…

Thank you, thank you, kinsman. I was so helpless against them. I even tried to use a key I found as a weapon.

Id: [0x002D3BED]
My friends, the Toothbreakers, were with me, but we were separated when I went searching for what my key might open.

Id: [0x002D3BEF]
How did you come to be stuck here?

Id: [0x002D3BF0]
And how did you come to be stuck here?

Id: [0x002D3BF1]
Show me how the Raven Clan drink!

Id: [0x002D3BF2]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002D3BF5]
Your fist is without ale! Let us address that.

Id: [0x002D3BF6]
Eivor! Drink, come, [hic]drink!

Id: [0x002D3BF8]
Stay strong, my child. Bjorn is here.

Id: [0x002D3BFE]
Good ol' Arne, my beloved pet, fell down … well, flew his way down below. Now, the poor thing is stuck.

Id: [0x002D3BFF]
I cannot seem to encourage my Arne to fly back up. [sigh]Looks like we still have a long way to go.

Id: [0x002D3C00]
Dropped something?

Id: [0x002D3C08]
I … I am sorry, Frey. He died by prey, but he will rest a hunter.

Id: [0x002D3C0B]
He is in the halls now.

Id: [0x002D3C14]
Then may it bring you more luck than it did us. Maybe you will even solve the serpent's mystery.

Id: [0x002D3C24]
Yes. Even the gods will die.

Id: [0x002D3C29]
Yes. They let loyal hounds into the Hall of the Brave. So Njal too is there. [beat]With Alfhild.

Id: [0x002D3C2D]
I did it, Sis! I sold one! I did it!

Id: [0x002D3C37]
We made the goats together! But the cold took her last winter.

Id: [0x002D3C38]
I promised her I would continue selling our goats. She said they can bring warmth into the hearts of others.

Id: [0x002D3C3A]
Here, it's yours. I hope it will keep you warm on your travels! Goodbye, nice stranger!

Gungnir … is it you?

Gungnir … is it you?

Mjolnir … you must be.

Are you the sword the Britons call … Excalibur?

Are you the sword the Britons call … Excalibur?

Id: [0x002D3DF4]
Ask around about Olav. Someone must know where he has run off too.

Id: [0x002D3DF5]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002D3DF6]
What is this place?

Id: [0x002D3DF7]
(laugh)

Id: [0x002D3DFA]
Is anyone home?

Is anyone home?

Id: [0x002D3DFC]
But sharp steel helps, o yes.

Id: [0x002D3E11]
We should stop coming here, Skegi. It only saddens you and angers me.

Id: [0x002D3E12]
Yes… [sigh]Yes you are right.

Id: [0x002D3E13]
Then let's go. And never come back.

Id: [0x002D3E14]
Just a moment longer…

Wolf Pack!

Wolf Pack!

[ONO: exaggerated gutting noise]The prey has no time to run. No time to even blink, as his trachea is ripped out through his neck!

This … this is not for me.

Id: [0x002D3E21]
This … this is not for me.

Id: [0x002D3E22]
Full of lust for blood and battle, the Big Wolf smashes pots and bodies alike.

Id: [0x002D3E25]
What is all this? Who bangs the drums of war?

Id: [0x002D3E26]
What is all this? Who bangs the drums of war?

Id: [0x002D3E27]
Together, the Wolf Pack stands in the wreckage of the enemy village. Nothing remains but thralls to be taken, and flaming carnage!

Id: [0x002D3E29]
Thank you, young warrior. We built this fishing village with our own hands before it was taken from us.

Id: [0x002D3E2A]
You looking to set foot in there? I would not advise it.

Id: [0x002D3E2B]
You're looking to set foot in there? I would not advise it.

Id: [0x002D3E2D]
We know. Such is the case in all of Lincolnscire. But you have given us a small victory to celebrate.

Id: [0x002D3E2E]
This is not the day you take it back. Only a matter of time before more roving bandits catch a whiff.

Id: [0x002D3E39]
Our first time was in the middle of a burning village … after a while, the crew made us stop. They said it was distracting.

Id: [0x002D3E3A]
H-he would plow you during raids?

Id: [0x002D3E3B]
He would plow you during raids?

Id: [0x002D3E3E]
It was a fishing village once. Built it with our bare hands, all of it.

Id: [0x002D3E3F]
You lived here?

Id: [0x002D3E40]
You lived here?

Id: [0x002D3E45]
What is this?

Id: [0x002D3E49]
Brother, are you well? I feared the worst for you.

Id: [0x002D3E4A]
It will not be easy. Why not take my wife with you? Stikla would love to raise Hel against these dogs.

Id: [0x002D3E4C]
Ja, but talking about it is not the same. I need to feel it. Smell it.

Id: [0x002D3E4E]
You could help us pretend we are raiding! That will make my water flow! Come, we must tell my husband.

Id: [0x002D3E50]
Love can burn brighter near death. Have you tried revisiting these memories?

Id: [0x002D3E51]

Goodbye. Goodbye!

Id: [0x002D3E58]
We know. Such is the case in all of Lincolnscire. But it would be a small victory. A chance to dip our feet for a while.

(battle cry)

Id: [0x002D3E5E]
Come and kneel before your raid leader, Big Wolf!

Id: [0x002D3E61]
Not a good idea. If anyone is to take care of these bandits, it will be me and me alone.

Id: [0x002D3E62]
Not a good idea. If anyone is to take care of these bandits, it'll be me and me alone.

Id: [0x002D3E66]
All right. I'll take her. Always good to rekindle a flame.

Id: [0x002D3F52]
O … yes! Yes! Let us go viking!

Id: [0x002D3F53]
And scream as you do. Like it is really happening.

Id: [0x002D3F58]
Hah! You jest, but I shall take you up on it. Until then!

Id: [0x002D3F59]

Careful now … we don't want to attract any unwanted attention from the Dark Elves. O, how they haunt me.

Id: [0x002D406F]
There. That is Freyr's castle. He keeps court in there. Or did. Until the Dark Elves came.

Id: [0x002D4090]
I want to kill that man. [beat]Help me.

Come, this way.

Id: [0x002D4098]
I would be happy to be so humbled.

Now, believe it or not, there was a time when I was easy on the eyes. The girl and I, we ran off together. But we were discovered.

Id: [0x002D40B5]
Wait … we … we're home. [discouraged]Full circle with nothing to show for it.

Id: [0x002D40BB]
You're days late!

Id: [0x002D40C5]
She had been promised to another, and that man had found us. We fled but had nowhere to run. I told the girl to hide, but she did not.

Id: [0x002D40C6]
She was convinced he would not harm me. A word from her and he would leave us. Sadly, she was wrong. Vengeance gripped his mind.

Id: [0x002D40C7]
To restore his lost honor, he challenged me to a holmgang (duel). I was nothing but a young lad, there was no winning. I knew that.

Id: [0x002D40C8]
My sweetheart encouraged me to fight, I could see in her eyes, she believed in me! But my knocking knees drowned out all sound.

Id: [0x002D40C9]
I ran. I ran to the sounds of her howling. Her barbed words cursing me to a coward's painful death.

Id: [0x002D40D0]
What happened here?

Id: [0x002D40D1]
What happened here?

Id: [0x002D40D7]
Our bodies may be broken, our pouches may be empty, but our souls will thrive.

Id: [0x002D40D8]
An attack gone awry. We found more of Constantin's Picts than expected. The rich have their numbers … both in coin and spears.

Id: [0x002D40F0]
Why won't you just stay still! Ugh!

Id: [0x002D40F3]
This one first … then this one … ugh! No!

Id: [0x002D40F9]
I need more fire, more oil! They must burn, they must burn…

Id: [0x002D40FE]
It's my fault. I killed them. My greed robbed me of my senses and now my family.

Id: [0x002D40FF]
My brother was to inherit my father's wealth. [sudden anger]But it was my right! They called me a lout, a disgrace.

Id: [0x002D4100]
[beat]They were right. Now our family fortune sits in the house. Worthless when there is nobody left to enjoy it with.

Id: [0x002D4101]
A favor, I beg of you. Slay me so I may join them in Helheim and beg their forgiveness.

Id: [0x002D4104]
You lot have not fought a full campaign under Halfdan's banner, I would wager. Let me tell you what it was like.

Id: [0x002D4105]
Rarely was there a song-of-swords when Halfdan set forth. Smart Saxons submitted and the brave were butchered.

Id: [0x002D4108]
Halfdan's march through England was unstoppable. But everyone bows to a king until his back is turned.

Id: [0x002D4109]
I accepted my charge. There are those who bemoan not being able to fight and die on the field. But Halfdan needed us alive.

Id: [0x002D410A]
One by one I saw him entrust a city or a village to his older, loyal followers. Until it came to me … until East Anglia.

Id: [0x002D410F]
For Alfhild!

Id: [0x002D4110]
Show me what you can do, berserker!

Id: [0x002D4111]
Show me what you can do, berserker!

Id: [0x002D4113]
Soon, his reputation reached the hinterlands well before the man himself arrived. And Saxons awaited him with riches, not steel.

Id: [0x002D4114]
Even glorious kings who have not known treason will do so in time. Halfdan had to ensure that what was his would remain so.

Id: [0x002D4116]
This is not a small amount of silver. I can see why that man succumbed to greed.

Id: [0x002D4139]

He knew the better, younger fighters should remain at his side, while his wizened drengir served as his eyes across these lands.

Id: [0x002D4157]
Eivor. You came at Guthrum's call. It is good to see you.

Id: [0x002D4158]
No, we took Werham without resistance. These Saxons accompany their lord, as we stand beside Guthrum.

Id: [0x002D415A]
Guthrum is not a babe-at-teat, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D415B]
Guthrum should be careful. Aelfred speaks with Loki's tongue.

Id: [0x002D415C]
Guthrum should be careful. Aelfred speaks with Loki's tongue.

Id: [0x002D415E]
When news of this spreads through the camp, no Saxon will survive the day.

Id: [0x002D4169]
Blood and battle!

Id: [0x002D416B]
Die already! Why won't you go down?

Id: [0x002D416C]
Death to heathen dogs!

Id: [0x002D4183]
They are routed! The city is ours. Wessex will follow!

Id: [0x002D4185]
Their king is fled, his patsy struck down. Defeat rings loud in their ears, and I will be their lord before the spring is here.

Id: [0x002D4188]
She has gone to the endless feast. And is the better for it.

Id: [0x002D4189]
Guthrum, hear me … Soma is … she is gone.

Id: [0x002D418A]
Guthrum, hear me … Soma is … she is gone.

Id: [0x002D4191]
Follow me!

Id: [0x002D4193]
It is not far!

Id: [0x002D4194]
The jarl will be grateful, trust me!

Id: [0x002D4195]
You will be well rewarded!

Id: [0x002D4196]
We are near. Go on, they are up ahead.

Id: [0x002D4198]
Fine. Follow me.

Id: [0x002D4199]
Hurry, or they will kill him.

Id: [0x002D419B]
Just hurry.

Id: [0x002D41A4]
You know where they are. You lead.

Id: [0x002D41A5]
You know where they are. You lead.

Id: [0x002D41A6]
Kill him? Do they not want a ransom?

Id: [0x002D41A7]
Kill him? Do they not want a ransom?

Id: [0x002D41AC]
Come one, come all! Nothing heals the heart of woe like a mug of ale.

Id: [0x002D41AF]
This pathetic gamble has cost them their lives.

Id: [0x002D41B0]
This pathetic gamble has cost them their lives.

Id: [0x002D41B1]
They threatened to kill me if I did not help.

Id: [0x002D41B3]
So to save your life, you led others to their death.

Id: [0x002D41B4]
So to save your life, you led others to their death.

Id: [0x002D41B5]
You are an eager one.

Id: [0x002D41B6]
Alright then! Come!

Id: [0x002D41B7]
Alright then, let us begin!

Id: [0x002D41B8]
I am pretty good. Do not say I did not warn you.

Id: [0x002D41B9]
You just made my day, stranger! Let's have at it.

Id: [0x002D41BA]
Excellent! Let us not tarry.

Id: [0x002D41BB]
[laughing]I hope you know what you have gotten yourself into.

Id: [0x002D41BC]
I will not go easy on you!

Id: [0x002D41BD]
Our village was burned by Kjotve the Cruel. We had to flee to the forest. Those who survived grew mean and desperate.

Id: [0x002D41BE]
Olaf, one of the men you killed, said we had to fight for our land. But he only wanted to kill for silver.

Id: [0x002D41CB]

Orlog. There is a player in every port and city.

Id: [0x002D41D0]
Orlog, I am interested.

Id: [0x002D41D1]
Orlog, I could do with a round.

Id: [0x002D41D2]
Ah, Orlog, I know this game well.

Id: [0x002D41D3]
I do miss the rattling of luck-bones.

What say you! A quick rattling of bones to kill some time?

Id: [0x002D41DA]
Orlog, indeed. Let us have a game then.

Id: [0x002D41DB]
Yes! Orlog! Join me?

Id: [0x002D41DC]
Sit, sit! The dice won't roll themselves!

Id: [0x002D41DD]
Got your attention didn't I? Come, let's play!

Id: [0x002D41DE]
A worthy challenger! Play me, I need my daily entertainment.[laughing]

Id: [0x002D41DF]
Have a seat, will you?

Id: [0x002D41E0]
Come join me for a game or two.

Id: [0x002D41E2]
Let us do this then.

Id: [0x002D41E3]
Lets begin.

Id: [0x002D41E4]
Let's do this then.

Id: [0x002D41E5]
Let us begin.

Id: [0x002D41E6]
Did not expect you to shy from a challenge! Things are never as they seem.

Id: [0x002D41E7]
Another time, stranger.

Id: [0x002D41E8]
You sure? Victory could very well be yours?[laughing]

Id: [0x002D41E9]
Be gone with you!

Id: [0x002D41EA]
I will pass this time.

Id: [0x002D41EB]
There are other things I must do. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D41EC]
I will pass this time.

Id: [0x002D41ED]
There are other things I must do. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D41EE]
The dice will not roll themselves, you know!

Id: [0x002D41EF]
Off with you then.

Id: [0x002D41F0]
If you ever feel like it, you know where to find me.

Id: [0x002D41F1]
Never known a Dane to refuse a challenge!

Id: [0x002D41F2]
Too easy.

Id: [0x002D41F3]
I am getting good at this.

Id: [0x002D41F5]
How did - What - No! Again!

Id: [0x002D41F8]
Tough luck! Try again?

Id: [0x002D41FB]
Stings to lose so badly, does it not? [laughing]Fancy another game?

Id: [0x002D41FE]
Ugh. Utter defeat.

Id: [0x002D41FF]
And I thought I was good at this.

Id: [0x002D4201]
Bah! You just got lucky. Another round?

Id: [0x002D4204]
Good game.

Id: [0x002D4205]
Ah, sweet victory.

Id: [0x002D4207]
You win.

Id: [0x002D4208]
Could have been anyone's game.

Id: [0x002D420D]
Don't be too hard on yourself. Orlog is a whimsical game. Let's go again!

Id: [0x002D420E]
I may have won this time, but next game ... it could be anyone's. How about it? Another go?

Id: [0x002D420F]
No! I played perfectly! Another round?

Id: [0x002D4210]
An overwhelming defeat! I must reclaim my name, let us go again.

Id: [0x002D4211]
I just got lucky there, stranger. Things might not go so smoothly again. Let us continue.

Id: [0x002D4212]
Well played, stranger. Another round?

Id: [0x002D4213]
I'll give you a chance to win your honor back, play again!

Id: [0x002D4214]
My, my! It has been awhile since I met a worthy opponent. Another round!

Id: [0x002D4215]
I will go easy on you this time. Come on, let us roll again.

Id: [0x002D4216]
Today is supposed to be a lucky day for me! Shall we go again?

Id: [0x002D4217]
Do not mind that loss, warrior. Think of redemption instead! Another game perhaps?

Id: [0x002D4218]
You won by a landslide. Next time it will not go as easily. Another round?

Id: [0x002D421F]
Good game.

Id: [0x002D4220]
Ah, sweet victory.

Id: [0x002D4221]
Ugh. Utter defeat.

Id: [0x002D4222]
And I thought I was pretty good at this.

Id: [0x002D4223]
You win.

Id: [0x002D4224]
Could have been anyone's game.

Id: [0x002D4225]
Too easy.

Id: [0x002D4226]
I am getting good at this.

Id: [0x002D4227]
Another time, perhaps.

Id: [0x002D4228]
That is enough Orlog for now.

Id: [0x002D4229]
Another round!

Id: [0x002D422A]
Set the board, we go again.

Id: [0x002D422B]
Another time, perhaps.

Id: [0x002D422C]
That is enough Orlog for now.

Id: [0x002D422D]
Another round!

Id: [0x002D422E]
Set the board, we go again.

Id: [0x002D422F]
Now, that's what I like to hear.

Id: [0x002D4230]
I like your spirit!

Id: [0x002D4231]
Now we are talking! Prepare yourself!

Id: [0x002D4232]
Come back soon, you are good company.[laughing]

Id: [0x002D4233]
See you around, stranger.

Id: [0x002D4234]
As you wish!

Id: [0x002D4235]
Aye, I will be right here if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002D4236]
Aye, take care now.

Id: [0x002D4242]
Go easy on me, will you?

Id: [0x002D4243]
Ugh! Not like this.

Id: [0x002D4244]
How do you like that!

Id: [0x002D4245]
The end is nigh for you!

Id: [0x002D4246]
Will you not stay down?

Id: [0x002D4247]
You are testing my patience.

Id: [0x002D4248]
You are really good at this.

Id: [0x002D4249]
How did you do that?

Id: [0x002D424A]
This does not bode well…

Id: [0x002D424B]
Not good ... not good.

Id: [0x002D424C]
This will do.

Id: [0x002D424D]
Interesting ...

Id: [0x002D424E]
Look at that!

Id: [0x002D424F]
Wow!

Id: [0x002D4250]
I have you cornered now.

Id: [0x002D4251]
This game is as good as over!

Id: [0x002D4252]
Just give up, already!

Id: [0x002D4253]
So close!

Id: [0x002D4254]
You are really good at this.

Go easy on me, will you?

Id: [0x002D425D]
Ugh! Not like this.

This game is as good as over!

Id: [0x002D428A]
Hope you have a plan.

Id: [0x002D428B]
Not your day, friend.

Id: [0x002D428C]
This is my game, stranger. Just give up.

Id: [0x002D428D]
Your defeat is imminent.

Id: [0x002D428E]
This will be over soon.

Id: [0x002D428F]
This victory will be mine.

Id: [0x002D4290]
Back in the game.

Id: [0x002D4291]
Too close for comfort. Better make this count.

Id: [0x002D4292]
Not good enough.

Id: [0x002D4293]
Nearly got me there.

Id: [0x002D4294]
This is my game, stranger. Just give up.

Too close for comfort. Better make this count.

Id: [0x002D429E]
You look like you know a thing or two about dice.

Id: [0x002D429F]
Can I interest you in a game of Orlog?

Id: [0x002D42A0]
How about a game of Orlog?

Id: [0x002D42A1]
Sheathe your edge and grab some dice, stranger. Come!

Id: [0x002D42A2]
Rest from rattling skulls! Rattle these bones instead, eh?

Id: [0x002D42A3]
Looking for a worthy challenger!

Id: [0x002D42A4]
My dice-hand is itching for a challenger.

Id: [0x002D42A5]
A game of Orlog may turn your fate around.

Id: [0x002D42A8]
I could do more than comb your hair, find all your knots and snags and tame them … if you'd like.

Id: [0x002D42A9]
Comb my hair? Is that why those men scrambled over each other?

Id: [0x002D42AA]

Be vigilant to search all places, whether high and dry or … [heavy innuendo]low and wet.

Id: [0x002D42AD]
It must be around here somewhere.

Id: [0x002D42AE]
You will have to search every crack and cave.

Id: [0x002D42B1]
Those are the cries of a broken heart. Who died?

Id: [0x002D42B2]
Those are the cries of a broken heart. Who died?

Wolves. It must be the pack that Ornir quarreled with.

Well, thank you. A question. Does the name Guthban mean anything to you?

Id: [0x002D4390]
Well, thank you. A question. Does the name Guthban mean anything to you?

Id: [0x002D4392]
Do not listen. He will poison our thoughts.

Id: [0x002D4393]
You have no thoughts to poison!

Id: [0x002D4394]
Die, monster!

Id: [0x002D4395]
To Hel with you!

Id: [0x002D439B]
You may claim his belongings. His body I will give to the land.

Id: [0x002D439C]
I struck first, so I will claim the bounty. You may take what you wish from its carcass.

Id: [0x002D43A7]
These men are foul, Eivor. You should not have to fight my battles for me.

Id: [0x002D43AC]
I do not know your face, but I know…

Id: [0x002D43B8]
But is it enough to make Skadi happy? No! She wants us to freeze up in the … f-fucking mountains!

Id: [0x002D43BA]
I care not. I have mead enough to keep me warm till … till … till Skadi and her clan return to their f-frigid homeland.

Id: [0x002D43BC]
I had not thought of that! By Ymir's balls, I must return to shore! Bring me a boat! I still have my pride.

Id: [0x002D43BE]
You cannot keep this up. Your wailing will summon a sea storm.

Id: [0x002D43BF]
You cannot keep this up. Your wailing will summon a sea storm.

Id: [0x002D43C9]
To return to my wife, Ronnow. Our village was destroyed. I died with my axe. She did not.

Id: [0x002D43CA]
Havi! You must let me through.

Id: [0x002D43E5]
I challenge you to a duel. If I win, fulfill my wish. If you win, send me to Hel because I am an unfit warrior.

Id: [0x002D43E6]
If it were your love, you would move the Nine Realms to reunite with her. You care not for us warriors!

Id: [0x002D43E8]
I miss her, Havi. I miss how she'd weave flowers in my hair. I miss her crooked front teeth.

Later, my friend. Come. And enjoy your stay.

Id: [0x002D43ED]
Later, my friend. Come. And enjoy your stay.

Id: [0x002D43F0]
Well, this has a bitter taste, rejection. But I have supped on far worse. And I am happy we can be friends.

Id: [0x002D43F3]
Tarben, no … you are important to me, but as a friend. That is all.

Id: [0x002D43F4]
Tarben, no … you are important to me, but as a friend. That is all.

Id: [0x002D43F8]
As am I. And I do hope that you find what you seek someday, in another.

Id: [0x002D43F9]
I care for you, Eivor. Since we burned my name in the ledger that day, my thoughts have drifted back to you daily.

Id: [0x002D43FC]
Ah … then all I can say is, I hope you are happy and well-loved.

Id: [0x002D43FD]
And that someday I may find someone as earnestly good and noble as yourself.

Id: [0x002D43FF]
Tarben … I'm sorry, but I am already spoken for.

Id: [0x002D4400]
Tarben … I'm sorry, but I am already spoken for.

Id: [0x002D4401]
Thank you, Tarben. My friend. I hold that hope for you as well.

Id: [0x002D4402]
Thank you, Tarben. My friend. I hold that hope for you as well.

Id: [0x002D4407]
Y-you mean that?

Id: [0x002D4408]
I care for you as well, Tarben. You speak words that I have often said myself.

Id: [0x002D4409]
I care for you as well, Tarben. You speak words that I have often said myself.

Id: [0x002D440E]
In you, I see the fighter I once was, yet your aims are noble. Honest. I cannot look away.

Id: [0x002D4410]
May I … may I kiss you?

Id: [0x002D4411]
You and I are so alike in our nature. But you temper the flames that burn in me. That comforts me.

Id: [0x002D4412]
You and I are so alike in our nature. But you temper the flames that burn in me. That comforts me.

Come here…

Id: [0x002D4418]
The longhouse? I think I am perfectly happy here.

We will give you what we took, traveler, but first … you must listen to our story!

Id: [0x002D4441]
Aw! Retreat![giggle]

Id: [0x002D444E]
You're back, large walker!

Id: [0x002D4455]
You! You little rat! Come back with my horse!

Uh-oh! Let's go, Skinfaxi! Follow the wind![giggle]

Id: [0x002D4457]
Gah! [huffing and puffing]Stop! Stop!

Id: [0x002D445C]
Maybe the horse will have a better life now.

Id: [0x002D445D]
Maybe the horse will have a better life now.

Id: [0x002D4472]
It was just before you came, Eivor. Rued's men had made a spectacle of the poor man, a Christian priest.

Id: [0x002D4475]
I am getting closer…[sniffing]

Id: [0x002D4479]
My keen wolf nose is picking up a scent…[growl]

Id: [0x002D447D]
Awoo! Fenrir is getting hungry!

Id: [0x002D4481]
These Picts are a sneaky lot, masters of guile and ambush. Have a care.

Id: [0x002D4487]
If their blood doesn't cleanse them of their sins, send them to Hell with the others.

Id: [0x002D448A]
O Lord, forgive them not, forget them not.

Id: [0x002D448C]
And a drunken one at that, his veins ran with mead. But he had guts. Bolstered by his Bible in one hand, ale horn in the other.

Id: [0x002D4491]
If Oswald bound the people with faith in each other, Aethelred bound them with the love of God. His piety verged on fanaticism.

Id: [0x002D449E]
In time I learned that Aethelred had a following. Reverent men who feared nothing, and embraced death in service of their God.

Id: [0x002D449F]
You are both welcome to any good crops my farm will produce. Look for me at my farm in a few days!

Id: [0x002D44A5]
And what is your take on the mystery? Still believe a wolf or bear did these things?

Id: [0x002D44A7]
Wulfhilda. I have learned all I can from the villagers. And those dead beasts.

Id: [0x002D44A8]
Wulfhilda. I have learned all I can from the villagers. And those dead beasts.

Id: [0x002D44A9]
This is not the work of a woodland creature. The bite marks. The mold. Most odd.

Id: [0x002D44AA]
This is not the work of a woodland creature. The bite marks. The mold. Most odd.

Id: [0x002D44AB]
More and more joined him as East Anglia plunged deeper into despair. Emboldened, he sought to purge the lands of Rued's clan.

Id: [0x002D44AC]
I counseled him as best I could, but his faith in God emboldened him. His courage rivaled Rued's, but it was all he had.

Id: [0x002D44AD]
No combat experience, no trained warriors. Just sacks of meat falling apart. Aethelred was butchered, along with his men.

Id: [0x002D44B3]
It was Hrothgar's war-band! They're holed up in that old church, working their misery upon us.

Id: [0x002D44B5]
How can you be sure?

Id: [0x002D44B6]
How can you be sure?

Id: [0x002D44BA]
Did the wolves get a bite of you?

Id: [0x002D44BB]
Did the wolves get a bite of you?

Id: [0x002D44BC]
I will speak to this Hrothgar and his war-band.

Id: [0x002D44BD]
I will speak to this Hrothgar and his war-band.

Id: [0x002D44C2]
I have seen many strange things, but the answers are usually close at hand, if only hidden.

Id: [0x002D44C3]
I have seen many strange things, but the answers are usually close at hand, if only hidden.

Id: [0x002D44C9]
I shall find him.

Id: [0x002D44CA]
I shall find him.

Id: [0x002D44CD]
I say find the mold and we find our killer.

Id: [0x002D44CE]
I say find the mold and we find our killer.

Id: [0x002D44D2]
What can we do? Father is alone down there…

Id: [0x002D44D9]
That lake goes deep.

Id: [0x002D44DA]
That lake goes deep.

Id: [0x002D44DC]
Wait, warrior. There were … two …

Id: [0x002D44DE]
Yeah, to Hell with his sad Pickering love story and his homely fish-stall wife.

Id: [0x002D44DF]
That reminds me, remember to go down and get that ring, eh?

Id: [0x002D44E3]
Are you the wife of the man who fishes below the cliff?

Id: [0x002D44E4]
Are you the wife of the man who fishes below the cliff?

Id: [0x002D44E6]
Doubt he felt much.

Id: [0x002D44E7]
Doubt he felt much.

Id: [0x002D44EF]
Get your rest, warrior. I'll stand vigil with prayer.

Id: [0x002D44F1]
I am waiting to fight your champion, Loki Rabbit! Send them forth to meet me in the square!

Id: [0x002D44F7]
The creature disappeared.

Id: [0x002D44F8]
The creature disappeared.

Id: [0x002D44FA]
Of course he did! So go the tricks of Loki Rabbit!

Id: [0x002D44FC]
The Picts are just ahead. Lead the way and we'll watch your back.

Id: [0x002D450B]
Hey! You! My eyes and soul do not deceive me! You are the Wolf-Kissed, are you not? Come, come!

Id: [0x002D451C]
The Withering?

Id: [0x002D451D]
The Withering?

Id: [0x002D451F]
I … I…[crying]

Id: [0x002D4520]
They will find peace in death. Live for them, they would want that.

Id: [0x002D4521]
They will find peace in death. Live for them, they would want that.

Id: [0x002D4522]
But … Papa … Mama …

Id: [0x002D4528]
There is no more epic a tale than the story of how I found my ship. The glorious fire ship! Remember her? It was a prize!

Id: [0x002D452D]
I was piss drunk one night, could barely stand. And up comes this young upstart Dane, fresh off a lucky raid, to fight me.

Id: [0x002D4534]
That sounds good. Let us go inside.

Id: [0x002D4535]
That sounds good. Let us go inside.

Id: [0x002D4537]
Nooooo! Aldwyn!

Id: [0x002D4539]
Suit yourself. It would have been a good time.

Id: [0x002D453B]
I will pass.

Id: [0x002D453C]
I will pass.

Id: [0x002D453E]
I'm sure. Good luck then, whoever you pursue. I've done all I can.

Id: [0x002D453F]
I'm sure. Good luck then, whoever you pursue. I've done all I can.

Id: [0x002D4543]
His mother!

Id: [0x002D4546]
I slew a monster that was but a man. Then I tracked his mother and killed her too.

Id: [0x002D4547]
I slew a monster that was but a man. Then I tracked his mother and killed her too.

Id: [0x002D4548]
She struck at me in the dark, and I defended myself. But it was no hero's deed.

Id: [0x002D4549]
She struck at me in the dark, and I defended myself. But it was no hero's deed.

Id: [0x002D454B]
They are delicious.

Id: [0x002D454C]
Cake is delicious.

Id: [0x002D454E]
A fitting name for future warriors.

Id: [0x002D454F]
A fitting name for future warriors.

Id: [0x002D4551]
Aye!

Id: [0x002D4552]
Aye!

Id: [0x002D4554]
Aye!

Id: [0x002D4555]
Aye!

Id: [0x002D4557]
So, he speaks.

Id: [0x002D4558]
So, he speaks.

Id: [0x002D4559]
Come along, Chad. We still have work to do.

Id: [0x002D455A]
Work? You still want me to work? I can't even see my own hands, you heartless bastard!

Id: [0x002D455B]
There you are, Chad. About time you showed your face … or what is left of it!

Id: [0x002D455C]
Burk? No! No! No! Get away from me!

Id: [0x002D455E]
Aye, that I did. What is a leader to do when his men can't take their eyes off of his treasure, even after several warnings?

Id: [0x002D455F]
I … I was not looking! You stabbed my eyes out!

Id: [0x002D4560]
Quiet now, Chad. [to Eivor]Come, hand him over to me.

Id: [0x002D4561]
He says you blinded him.

Id: [0x002D4562]
He says you blinded him.

Id: [0x002D4563]
Challenged to a brawl! He was thirsting for a bruising, for no reason I could see. I warned him off, gave him a chance to walk.

Id: [0x002D4564]
But his companions were with him, egging him on. And this little shit, he bellowed into the drunken night that he would wager his ship.

Id: [0x002D4566]
I had nothing to lose but my morning. If I fell, I would suffer a bruising and walk away. If I won, I would have a ship!

Id: [0x002D4567]
Do your best to follow me, Chad.

Id: [0x002D4568]
Just kill me instead.

Id: [0x002D456A]
He might have been better off stuck below the bridge. Too late now.

Id: [0x002D456B]
He might have been better off stuck below the bridge. Too late now.

Id: [0x002D456C]
Don't make me do this!

Id: [0x002D456D]
Don't make me do this!

Id: [0x002D456E]
As soon as I accepted, he charged me, barehanded! Cocky bastard. So I raised my fists and stumbled forward.

Id: [0x002D456F]
But the brat slipped too! Landed on his face, knocking him cold. I'm told he did not wake for a full day, long after I had sailed away.

Id: [0x002D4571]
Yay!

Id: [0x002D4572]
Back in St. Martin's Land.

Id: [0x002D4573]
Back in St. Martin's Land.

Id: [0x002D4577]
With my first step, I slipped, plunging to the sand. I fell forward thinking, "There go my dreams of riding the whale-road alone."

Id: [0x002D4587]
They spotted us! Run forward, faster, faster!

Id: [0x002D458A]
I will tell you this … no one is born with the gift of Odin's verse. One must work and suffer to learn the skill of flyting.

Id: [0x002D458E]
Used to?

Id: [0x002D458F]
Used to?

Id: [0x002D4593]
Or I could bring her back to her house, where the farmer waits.

Id: [0x002D4594]
Or I could bring her back to her house, where the farmer waits.

Id: [0x002D4598]
I remember the fire-fog filling my throat … wading through a sea of blood and meat … a spear piercing my heart…

Id: [0x002D459C]
Thor! Storm-Bringer! I offer you my blade! … Odin! Raven-Feeder! I give you my life!

Id: [0x002D459E]
Yes, think. What are your last memories?

Id: [0x002D459F]
Yes, think. What are your last memories?

Id: [0x002D45A0]
We will fight together and become part of the greatest army ever assembled.

Id: [0x002D45A1]
We will fight together and become part of the greatest army ever assembled.

Id: [0x002D45A4]
Your weapons will not harm me!

Id: [0x002D45A5]
I will bathe in your blood!

Id: [0x002D45A6]
Your curses cannot touch me!

Id: [0x002D45AB]
Where am I?

Id: [0x002D45B5]
Where the brave are honored.

Id: [0x002D45B6]
Where the brave are honored.

Id: [0x002D45BB]
I will drown the land in blood!

Id: [0x002D45BD]
Yes! Show me what brought you here!

Id: [0x002D45BE]
Yes! Show me what brought you here!

Id: [0x002D45CD]
My beloved cat, Sphinxy. And please, do not be so crass. Sphinxy has simply … passed on. She is in God's hands.

Id: [0x002D45D2]
Nothing hurts quite like a fresh wound. But in time, it will heal and life will return to normal.

Id: [0x002D45D3]
Nothing hurts quite like a fresh wound. But in time, it will heal and life will return to normal.

Id: [0x002D45D9]
[sigh]If only. Instead, I find myself missing her more and more with each passing winter.

Id: [0x002D45DB]
Eleven years ago tomorrow. A long time, I know.

Id: [0x002D45DC]
How long ago did Sphinxy pass on?

Id: [0x002D45DD]
How long ago did Sphinxy pass on?

Id: [0x002D45DF]
So this was the purpose behind their prancing. An offering to their caretaker.

Id: [0x002D45E0]
So this was the purpose behind their prancing. An offering to their caretaker.

Id: [0x002D45E4]
No hunt is more thrilling, and his meat has no equal. Come!

Id: [0x002D45E5]
You never tire of tracking this beast.

Id: [0x002D45E6]
You never tire of tracking this beast.

Id: [0x002D45E7]
Yes. Yet again, Saehrimnir has risen from his bones and escaped my kitchen. It should prove to be a vigorous chase.

Id: [0x002D45EC]
It is not enough that you're deadweight, I have to listen to your babbling as well.

Id: [0x002D45ED]
It is not enough that you are deadweight, I have to listen to your babbling as well.

Id: [0x002D45EE]
A man who falls asleep at any moment. How did you last this long?

Id: [0x002D45EF]
A man who falls asleep at any moment. How did you last this long?

Id: [0x002D45F0]
Lucky it was me that found you. Me on a good day, I may add.

Id: [0x002D45F1]
Lucky it was me that found you. Me on a good day, I may add.

Id: [0x002D45F2]
Come back or be branded a deserter!

Id: [0x002D45F3]
Do you want to be an outlaw? This is your last chance!

Id: [0x002D45F5]
Ew! Gill! This had better be in jest! Because if you are writing me love letters, that is vile, and I am telling Mother!

Id: [0x002D45F9]
Millie! Stop! The letter wasn't for you!

Id: [0x002D45FF]
So, Eyvind is asleep on his watch. That would explain some things.

Id: [0x002D4600]
So, Eyvind is asleep on his watch. That would explain some things.

Id: [0x002D4601]
Is he walking in his sleep?

Id: [0x002D4602]
Is he walking in his sleep?

Id: [0x002D4603]
Eyvind, wake up! You are headed for the edge!

Id: [0x002D4604]
Eyvind, wake up! You are headed for the edge!

Id: [0x002D4605]
Is he going to ride the rope-slide?

Id: [0x002D4606]
Is he going to ride the rope-slide?

Id: [0x002D4607]
[snore]…Windy … storm coming … [snort]Wha…? Ahhhhhhh!

Id: [0x002D4609]
W-Well, hello. This is quite the surprise.

Id: [0x002D460A]
[grunt]You've got a beautiful heart and mastery of verse. But, I do not return your feelings, Gill.

Id: [0x002D460C]
[grunt]But, Serle fancies you. I understand if you do not want his company. He isn't very handsome.

Id: [0x002D460D]
He does? The lad with the hair of bracken and smoldering gaze? Serle, you say? I must compose another letter!

Id: [0x002D460F]
[sarcastic]A little. [beat]Have you thought about honoring Sphinxy with a shrine? It is no burial, but it may ease your grief.

Id: [0x002D4610]
[sarcastic]A little. [beat]Have you thought about honoring Sphinxy with a shrine? It is no burial, but it may ease your grief.

Hello again.

Id: [0x002D4618]
Hello again.

Id: [0x002D461C]
Do you consider yourself a man who has features so delicate that God himself must have painted them on with a fine brush?

Id: [0x002D461D]
Do you consider yourself a man who has features so delicate that God himself must have painted them on with a fine brush?

Id: [0x002D461F]
Why are you shouting?

Id: [0x002D4620]
Why are you shouting?

Id: [0x002D4621]
If I have to risk more men looking for him, he will be branded and outlawed.

Id: [0x002D4625]
[grunt]Thank you.

Id: [0x002D4626]
Then I have a letter for you.

Id: [0x002D4627]
Then I have a letter for you.

Id: [0x002D462B]
The wandering poet! Hullo again!

Id: [0x002D462C]
Hello again.

Id: [0x002D462D]
Hello again.

Id: [0x002D4630]
O-o! I suppose! I'm not sure what that means, but it is pretty. Are you composing a poem in my likeness?

Id: [0x002D4631]
Would you say that you are cow-eyed and willow-limbed?

Id: [0x002D4632]
Would you say that you are cow-eyed and willow-limbed?

Id: [0x002D4634]
The sight of this majestic creature gives my own heart wings! I will follow in the same spirit.

Id: [0x002D4635]
The sight of this majestic creature gives my own heart wings! I will follow in the same spirit.

Id: [0x002D4639]
O, goodness! Many thanks. I cannot wait to meet my admirer!

Id: [0x002D463A]
Not me, but an admirer who prefers to remain secret until you two can meet. I have a letter with more details.

Id: [0x002D463B]
Not me, but an admirer who prefers to remain secret until you two can meet. I have a letter with more details.

Id: [0x002D463D]
I remember thinking … that one is cruel … and magnificent!

Id: [0x002D4640]
I am halfway there, but I cannot bring myself to sort through her things. I simply do not have the strength.

Id: [0x002D464D]
I sing the death-song!

Id: [0x002D464F]
Where are the others? There was a battle…

Id: [0x002D4651]
I welcome your battle lust!

Id: [0x002D4652]
I welcome your battle lust!

Id: [0x002D4653]
The best of them will join you in Valhalla.

Id: [0x002D4654]
The best of them will join you in Valhalla.

Id: [0x002D4655]
Raaaah!

Id: [0x002D4656]
Fight me for my life!

Id: [0x002D4658]
Is this the home of the gods?

Id: [0x002D465A]
Join me in the blood-dance!

Id: [0x002D465B]
Join me in the blood-dance!

Id: [0x002D465C]
Yes, and now it is yours as well.

Id: [0x002D465D]
Yes, and now it is yours as well.

Id: [0x002D465F]
I do not speak of death, Eivor. I speak of life! Life and glory everlasting!

Id: [0x002D4661]
If you wish to die, it will not be by my hand.

Id: [0x002D4662]
If you wish to die, it will not be by my hand.

Id: [0x002D4664]
But I will not be joining you.

Id: [0x002D4665]
As you seem to shun this place as often as possible, it must fall to me.

Id: [0x002D466A]
We are close, so close! From here, a final leg to this journey.

Id: [0x002D4672]
What is it?

Id: [0x002D4673]
What is it?

Id: [0x002D46D9]
No, those are the names of deliveries I have yet to make. Still waiting on payment.

Id: [0x002D46DB]
That could be. If you had a mind to deliver them yourself, I would cut you in. Surely they wouldn't refuse you payment.

Id: [0x002D46DD]
Yanli. This list … are these debts?

Id: [0x002D46DE]
Yanli. This list … are these debts?

Id: [0x002D46DF]
These are quite far away, and in all directions. It may be they don't have time to travel here.

Id: [0x002D46E0]
These are quite far away, and in all directions. It may be they don't have time to travel here.

Id: [0x002D46E1]
An interesting idea. Maybe when I have the time.

Id: [0x002D46E2]
An interesting idea. Maybe when I have the time.

Id: [0x002D46E3]
Keep the note, just in case.

Id: [0x002D46E6]
I had no idea. Here one day, gone the next. Thank you for that. You deserve some compensation.

Id: [0x002D46E7]
I think I did, unless I miscounted.

Id: [0x002D46E8]
I think I did, unless I miscounted.

Id: [0x002D46F5]
Or head south to Grantebridgescire to meet an army of Danes led by one Guthrum Jarl and his second, Soma.

Id: [0x002D46F6]
And what's more, our young friend Hytham has been conferring with contacts of his own in the cities.

Id: [0x002D46FA]
That's a lie.

Id: [0x002D46FB]
That's a lie.

There is a farmer at your house who needs it as well. She waits desperately for your return.

When you look like I do, and do not hit as hard as the young oafs, you must find different ways to survive.

Id: [0x002D4701]
I was to help him with physical errands and be a second ear to his compositions. In turn, he would teach me how to compose verse.

Id: [0x002D4702]
We would spar with words, and he taught me about wordsmithing new kennings. Those were good days, [beat]scant though they were.

Id: [0x002D4704]
I wish to write sagas of my own now, but I have never had the inspiration. It may be my journeys here will serve that purpose.

Id: [0x002D4709]
Just a little longer. Have you changed your mind? Will you take Stikla and send those bandits to Hel?

Id: [0x002D4716]
A good nickname must carry a good story. My nickname is Bjorn Bloodtooth, and I too carry a story to go with my name.

Id: [0x002D4718]
My nickname has nothing to do with battles nor my love of beef and meat. [beat]It is due to fish.

Id: [0x002D471A]
Years before I became a berserker, my greedy brother and I fished a mighty salmon run on the Orkla River.

Id: [0x002D471B]
The jarl of that place had offered a silver horn to the fisher who caught the heaviest fish that day.

Id: [0x002D471C]
I'd had little luck, until suddenly a fish as large as a pike leaped into my net, yet it gleamed sun-gold like a salmon should.

Id: [0x002D4720]
I hauled the fish aboard, but once on deck, it slipped my net and got free. I dove and held it down, but again it wriggled loose.

Id: [0x002D4722]
I dove forward, but my greedy brother tackled me so his son could spear the fish and claim the reward.

Id: [0x002D4723]
While my brother pinned my arms, I crawled forward and bit the fish, slamming it on the deck until it died. The prize was mine.

Id: [0x002D4725]
That is how I earned my name Bloodtooth. [laughing]Yet to my Alfhild, I was called Sweet-tooth, as I so loved her sweets.

Id: [0x002D4729]
Listen and I will tell you the story of the first berserker, a woodcutter named Grimr, who lived long ago in Finnmark by the sea.

Id: [0x002D472D]
Now, if you boil anything that long it ends up tasting like leather. Flavorless. With Fish, deer, horse! It does not matter!

Id: [0x002D472E]
To bring out the flavors, you must prepare the meat. Not just butcher and toss it into a pot with yesterday's sludge!

Id: [0x002D472F]
I have a recipe for bear. You coat it with honey and scrape it with salt before roasting over on a spit. Nothing better.

Id: [0x002D4731]
Each day, Grimr went into the woods with his fine axe, felling trees for huts, carts, and ships for the villages nearby.

Id: [0x002D4732]
One day, the jarl, a wicked man, took Grimr's shiny axe for himself. Now Grimr could not cut wood nor feed his family.

Id: [0x002D4733]
Every day, his children's hunger grew. At last, Grimr demanded the jarl fight him in a holmgang, but the jarl only laughed.

Id: [0x002D4734]
"You have no shield, mail or even an axe," said the jarl. Angry, Grimr said, "I need nothing to slay you." So the jarl agreed.

Id: [0x002D4735]
So Grimr went into the woods. A boar taught him how to charge. A bear taught him how to maul. A wolf taught him to claw and bite.

Id: [0x002D4736]
At sunup, the men fought. Grimr charged past the shield and mauled the axe away. His teeth he sunk deep in the jarl's throat.

Id: [0x002D473A]
The fight went as it must, with the jarl dead and Grimr a hero. Ever since, we study the art of the berserker as Grimr taught.

Id: [0x002D473D]
You see, there are few things in life that can be both luxury and need. I prefer not to squander the meat on my spit.

Id: [0x002D4740]
Keep it down or we're all dead.

Id: [0x002D4743]
Thank Thor, we made it. That was good war-work, all.

Id: [0x002D4745]
When I gave up my berserker ways, my family decided to leave Norway. We sold our farm and weapons for a dozen silver deniers.

Id: [0x002D474A]
We sailed the whale-roads with a merchant fleet, settling near Jorvik after Halfdan's battles. Alfhild, Njal, and I owned a home.

Id: [0x002D474B]
Each day, we went to the market where Njal did tricks to earn coin. We were beloved, and Njal was pleased by Jorvik's tasty fish.

Id: [0x002D474C]
But one day, people no longer enjoyed Njal's tricks. The market was empty. The town's folk had gone to watch a new act in town.

Id: [0x002D474D]
We went too, only to find a bear-baiting ring. They kept a bear in a pit, fighting dogs and thralls. We were … sickened.

Id: [0x002D474E]
That night, we formed a plan. We met the bear's owners and plied them with strong ale. Once asleep, we threw them in the pit!

Id: [0x002D474F]
Their bear mauled them savagely, for they mistreated it badly. The bear then followed Njal and us out of that wicked town.

Id: [0x002D4751]
I'm done in with raiding good and godly places.

Id: [0x002D4752]
We led the bear into Pictland. And as for our part, we moved to Dunwic in East Anglia … where our troubles began anew.

Id: [0x002D4757]
The Picts march this winter with help from an unknown quarter. Hmm.

Id: [0x002D4758]

Aldwyn! My love beams bright, my heart…

Id: [0x002D4761]
Go away, Bertha!

Id: [0x002D4762]
Run! The heathens have found us!

Id: [0x002D4766]
When I came to England with the Sons of Ragnar, I believed it would be a brief raid. A swift adventure out on the open sea.

Id: [0x002D4767]
I loved that first crossing. Sliding over the blue expanse, sea spray wetting my face. Hungry for new lands and adventures.

Id: [0x002D476A]
To Stenwege! The chief must know!

Id: [0x002D476B]
Memories of home always drew me back, distracted me. For it is there where all the worst parts of my life occurred.

Id: [0x002D476D]
It took too long to look ahead. But I do now. Halfdan's ambition gave rise to my own. He gave me an excuse to leave, to fight!

Id: [0x002D476E]
To die an honorable and glorious death so that we can live in the halls of our fathers.

Id: [0x002D476F]
One cannot look back, you understand? You cannot go home again. The seers know this. Our paths are set.

Id: [0x002D4770]
My life is here now. As is my death. Norway is a chapter past.

Id: [0x002D4771]
I once sat down and spoke to a Saxon priest. Not as men with different gods, but as drunk men. Curious, I questioned him.

After all, they too look to the gods for answers. Where we have many, they have just one. [laugh]Only need one, I suppose.

But I had yet to witness their God's primal powers. What were they? Did he bring bountiful harvests or boons?

Id: [0x002D4924]
The priest said that his God was everywhere and everything. I did not understand it then. Maybe I still do not.

Id: [0x002D4925]
But there is an undeniable vigor, a strength, in their idea of Heaven. Believing that their lives will one day be better still.

Id: [0x002D4926]
Even with us cleaving through it. [beat]Hope, Eivor. Hope. I think that is what their God brings them.

Id: [0x002D492B]

Id: [0x002D492F]
Eivor, I don't know if you heard the news, but dear Svend has died.

Id: [0x002D4931]
Not long ago. He passed in his sleep, in peace I think. It was Tove who found him.

Id: [0x002D4933]
That would ease her mind, yes.

Id: [0x002D4934]
Svend? When did this happen?

Years ago, the Sons of Ragnar hoped to pacify the land. They appointed a steward named Finnr to find a suitable Saxon king.

Id: [0x002D4A2C]
Listen well, so I may tell you a tale of the berserkers and why we keep our potent brew a secret.

Id: [0x002D4A2D]
Once there was a berserker named Nori Nine-Claws who became a wealthy jarl, known for his fair and generous hall.

Id: [0x002D4A2E]
Every day, dozens of thanes, merchants, cousins, and other hanger-ons ate at his table, drank his mead, and took his gifts.

Id: [0x002D4A2F]
Finally, Nori Jarl grew angry about these leeches. He ordered his cooks to prepare a secret brew for a magnificent feast.

Id: [0x002D4A30]
He then invited every freeloader in his jarldom to his meadhall, promising his greatest gift yet, to be given after the feast.

Id: [0x002D4A31]
As his guests ate and drank their fill, Nori and his loyal karls slipped away. One by one, the guests entered berserkergang.

Id: [0x002D4A32]
When the feast erupted into slaughter, Nori and his men torched the hall before fleeing on a ship, never to be seen again.

Id: [0x002D4A34]
There is much Odin-wisdoms to take away from this tale. I will let each rower think out which lesson is best for them.

Id: [0x002D4A35]
Heed me, rowers, and I will tell you the tale of how I met my wife, since many of you wonder at how we berserkers could ever wed.

Id: [0x002D4A37]
I was young, and at a Midsummer feast in Trondheim, when someone bumped me, knocking my sweet honeycomb into their mead.

Id: [0x002D4A38]
I was mad, but she just laughed at me. We spent the rest of the night together, sharing mead and honey. And other things.

Id: [0x002D4A39]
But in the morning, she sailed away with her fleet to Orkneyjar. I wept and raged, because I knew I would not see her again.

Id: [0x002D4A3A]
Then the gods smiled on me, and I found a ship headed to Orkney that needed a rower. I climbed aboard and for weeks, I rowed.

Id: [0x002D4A3B]
We landed, and I made my way to her father's farm, but too late! She was wedding that same day. The groom's hounds chased me away.

Id: [0x002D4A3C]
Heartbroken, I returned to the ship and slept. Next morn, we lifted sail and I began to row. It took an hour before I saw she was sitting behind me!

Id: [0x002D4A3D]
I was overjoyed. Sometime in the night, she had left the wedding and snuck onto our ship. We rowed together for weeks, wet and happy.

Id: [0x002D4A3F]
Those were happier days, before Njal and the berserking and my first battle. And of course, the dark deeds that later befell us.

Id: [0x002D4A40]
Friends, I have often said Njal was a gift from my wife, but until today, I have never told the full tale.

Id: [0x002D4A46]
In those days, Alfhild and I were young and often did the things that young lovers do, but we never could have a child.

Id: [0x002D4A47]
Still, we tried. Every day. Yet always we failed. [beat]I took this hard and sought guidance, so I went hunting in the woods.

Id: [0x002D4A48]
When I returned, Alfhild was gone! I searched every corner of town, but she was nowhere to be seen.

Id: [0x002D4A49]
At last, I asked the seeress, who told me she'd given Alfhild a mixture and sent her into the woods to find a child.

Id: [0x002D4A4A]
Think of the fear that ran through me! I ran into the woods and searched until I found her trail. I followed it deeper until …

Id: [0x002D4A4B]
Until I found blood. Near a cave mouth. I ventured inside, only to find dead wolves ringing a dying bear, its fur snow white.

Id: [0x002D4A4C]
Fearing the worst, I searched on, only to have Alfhild find me. In her arms she held a mewling bear-cub. Alfhild had found Njal.

Id: [0x002D4A4D]
The wolves and bears had killed one another. The cub was starving until my wife found her, Njal, our daughter.

Id: [0x002D4A4E]
If I die, it'll be your fault, you know. Do you want that on your conscience? Do you?

Id: [0x002D4A4F]
Huh… There's a bear in here who wants to eat my face. I would quite like it subdued, please.

Id: [0x002D4A50]
Friends, they say skalds sing the best songs, but we berserkers know many tales and much goodly lore from the old days too.

Id: [0x002D4A51]
Let me tell you a tale from the bright green days of Midgard's youth so that you may judge my warrior's gift with words.

Id: [0x002D4A52]
Ages ago, the two tribes of gods were at war, the Aesir and the Vanir. After years of strife, they sat down to talk of peace.

Id: [0x002D4A53]
In the hall where the gods swore their peace oaths, they shared berries, taking the sweet and spitting the rinds into a bowl.

Id: [0x002D4A54]
The bowl was set aside and left to ferment. From this bowl, in time, was born the wise man, Ksavir, who knew clever things.

Id: [0x002D4A55]
Ksavir traveled the Nine Worlds, teaching, until he was slain by greedy dwarves who wished his secrets for themselves.

Id: [0x002D4A56]
Seeing what was done, Odin and the gods took back Ksavir's blood, from which they brewed a delicious mead for all.

Id: [0x002D4A57]
This is why mead, ale, and strong drink bring us poetry and joy, but also greed and sorrow. Partake with care. Skal!

Id: [0x002D4A5C]
Maybe pick a smaller animal to abuse next time. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D4A5D]
Maybe pick a smaller animal to abuse next time. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D4A60]
Strange things have we seen, and perhaps the doom of the Nine Worlds is nigh. Many believe these are the end of days.

Id: [0x002D4A64]
Quiet a moment and listen to my tale of the king in the east who showers gold upon warriors from Norway and Geatland.

Id: [0x002D4A65]
He be named Basil of Greece, the jarl of all jarls, and even his bathing tub is forged of gold. [beat]But such wealth draws envy.

Id: [0x002D4A67]
Every day, his jarls and thegns plotted for his life and lands, using poison, arrows, and blades. Basil lived in fear.

Id: [0x002D4A69]
One day, Basil was bathing in his golden tub when his enemies attacked. Naked, Basil leapt out a window and into the streets.

Id: [0x002D4A6A]
There he met by chance a warrior and trader of the Geats. The just warrior saved the naked man from the attackers.

Id: [0x002D4A6B]
Grateful, Basil gave this man gold and made him his chief thegn that day. But it is a poor leader that lacks loyal warriors.

Id: [0x002D4A6E]
Basil trusts these men, for they are not Greek and cannot take his land. [sigh]But it is a poor king that can't keep a throne.

Id: [0x002D4A6F]
So they formed the Varangian Guard to serve as Basil's loyal retainers, paying men from Geatland, Rus, Norway, and Denmark.

Id: [0x002D4A71]
Would you help me calm him?

Id: [0x002D4A72]
Some help over here? This skald had the bright idea to alter his mind.

Id: [0x002D4A73]
Do you think you can you stop him? Because I cannot.

Id: [0x002D4A75]
I will take on any challenger, be it on two legs or four! Show yourselves to me, if you dare!

Id: [0x002D4A76]
I cannot feel my lips … or my nose. Why does the sun burn so hot?

Id: [0x002D4A78]
"Hrolfr, you are destined for greatness," my father said. I did not really believe him, not until Odin showed himself to me.

Id: [0x002D4A79]
Yes, Odin. The night was heavy and the moon was full. I had a bladder full of mead, so I went outside to relieve myself.

Id: [0x002D4A7A]
My piss puddled in the soil, as piss does. In the moonlight, I saw my own reflection there. My own, and another.

Id: [0x002D4A7B]
Standing at my shoulder, taller than any had a right to be, was a bearded man in a broad hat, a raven on each shoulder.

Id: [0x002D4A7C]
His single eye fixed on me, bore into my skull. Can you believe it? This, the All-Father himself?

Id: [0x002D4A7D]
He nodded once, and I knew, I knew. The raven-tester had chosen me. For what, I did not know. But I will soon.

Id: [0x002D4A7F]
Odin has shown me my path forward. One day, I will carve my name into history.

Id: [0x002D4A83]
Come and fight me! You will be honored to add to my legend!

Id: [0x002D4A84]
Am I crying?

Id: [0x002D4A8F]
I have seen the shores of Francia now. Only a glimpse, but a glimpse was enough.

Id: [0x002D4A90]
The maidens toiling in the fields, the sweat on their breasts glistening.

Id: [0x002D4A92]
And the way they speak! Even an insult sounds like an invite. What else might they do with such elegant tongues?

Id: [0x002D4A99]
Death follows in my wake. I do not seek it out, but it is always there, nipping at my heels like a faithful hound.

Id: [0x002D4AA2]
It is done. A shrine dedicated to Sphinxy, whenever you care to pay your respects.

Id: [0x002D4AA3]
It is done. A shrine dedicated to Sphinxy, whenever you care to pay your respects.

Id: [0x002D4AA5]

Id: [0x002D4AA6]
I have found some of Sphinxy's belongings.

Agh!

Id: [0x002D4AB6]
Agh!

Id: [0x002D4AB7]
Here we are.

Id: [0x002D4AB8]
Here we are.

Id: [0x002D4AB9]
I will add this to the shrine.

Id: [0x002D4ABA]
I will add this to the shrine.

Id: [0x002D4ABB]
This will do.

Gilli was my first kill. He was twelve, I was six. He beat me every day, to my eternal shame.

Id: [0x002D4ABF]
I stole his mother's torc and tied it to the tail of the jarl's horse. Then I let him chase me into the stables, where I hid.

Id: [0x002D4AC0]
He saw the torc and went for it. And when he did, I took my stick and whipped that stallion right in the balls!

Id: [0x002D4AC1]
The stallion bucked, kicked Gilli right in the face. He never bullied me again after that.

Id: [0x002D4ACA]
As best as I know how. It is good to be here, with you and your people. I feel my life has found a new road.

Id: [0x002D4ACC]
How kind of you, Eivor. I will be sure to stir your soup with one, after I have had a sound scratching.

Id: [0x002D4ACD]
Vili. Making yourself at home?

Id: [0x002D4ACE]
Vili. Making yourself at home?

Id: [0x002D4ACF]
Good. And just so you know, we have all kinds of sticks nearby. Oak, beech, pine. In case your bum starts itching from sitting too long.

Id: [0x002D4AD0]
Good. And just so you know, we have all kinds of sticks nearby. Oak, beech, pine. In case your bum starts itching from sitting too long.

Id: [0x002D4AD2]
She is. Had a rough few weeks upon our return, but she is on her feet and with her family.

Id: [0x002D4AD4]
Rollo! Returned from Francia already, this is a surprise. Is the Lady Estrid well?

Id: [0x002D4AD5]
Rollo! Returned from Francia already, this is a surprise. Is the Lady Estrid well?

Id: [0x002D4AD6]
That's right. Your presence is much needed and well appreciated. Settle in and we'll sail soon enough.

Id: [0x002D4AD7]
That's right. Your presence is much needed and well appreciated. Settle in and we will sail soon enough.

Id: [0x002D4AD8]
In quiet moments like these, I often think on my life and how it will come to pass.

Id: [0x002D4ADA]
The Nornir weave our fates. Everything we do has already been decided, even the day of our death.

Id: [0x002D4ADC]
What is the point of valor? Of glory? If I slay a hundred men, am I a hero? After all, the dice were loaded.

Id: [0x002D4ADD]
Or does heroism lie in not knowing one's fate? Facing your end whatever the whims of the gods.

Id: [0x002D4ADE]
Perhaps the true measure of a man, the full span of his worth, is how little he gives a shit.

Id: [0x002D4AE7]
You were a brave man, Hunwald. Know that we will take care of Swanburrow, thought she will miss you every day.

Id: [0x002D4AE8]

Id: [0x002D4B43]
My lovely stone. My dear and lovely stone. I was waiting on that for ages. Thank you!

Id: [0x002D4B64]
A cask of rosewater mead! I never thought that would get here. You're an angel sent from Heaven.

Id: [0x002D4B65]
My bowls and cutlery. At last, they came. Thank you stranger.

Id: [0x002D4B66]
Is that … is that my new anvil? Lord, I thought it had been pilfered by bandits. I cannot thank you enough.

Id: [0x002D4B67]
Did you carry that all the way from central Mercia? God blind me, it's a wonder you weren't eaten by wolves on the way here.

Id: [0x002D4B7C]
I do not understand. Why would he do such a thing? He loved Sigurd. He loved you!

Id: [0x002D4B7E]
Sigurd and I, together. I know this comes as a--

Id: [0x002D4B7F]
Sigurd and I, together. I know this comes as a--

Id: [0x002D4B80]
I do not understand it myself. Perhaps one day we can speak about this with more clarity. But for now, I am deeply sorry.

"When pride cometh, then cometh shame. But with the lowly cometh wisdom."

Id: [0x002D4B8D]
Not by sight. But this soldier has intimate knowledge of The Order. He is the reason I have found them so easily in the cities.

Id: [0x002D4BD9]
O! It's you!

Id: [0x002D4BDD]
What-what … what-what-what did…

Id: [0x002D4BDE]
Ah! We made away with the coin, didn't we? Poor fools never suspected us, but we are more clever than we look, eh!

Id: [0x002D4BF6]
Ah, yes. Sorry…

Id: [0x002D4BF7]
Ah, yes. Sorry…

Id: [0x002D4C3B]
How do you feel, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D4C3D]
I understand.

Id: [0x002D4C3E]
I … I would rather not talk about it.

Id: [0x002D4C3F]
I … I would rather not talk about it.

Id: [0x002D4C40]
One more thing … I do not know if you heard, but Svend passed away a short time ago. The poor man slipped away in his bed.

Id: [0x002D4C42]
It has been rough on her. She spends quite a lot of time at his burial mound. Speak with her if you have the time.

Id: [0x002D4C44]
I think we all wish that. Tove most of all.

Id: [0x002D4C45]
I had not heard, no. And how is Tove? She must be gutted.

Id: [0x002D4C46]
I had not heard, no. And how is Tove? She must be gutted.

Id: [0x002D4C47]
Yes … I had heard, the poor man. I wish I could have spent more time with him before the end.

Id: [0x002D4C48]
Yes … I'd heard, the poor man. I wish I could have spent more time with him before the end.

Id: [0x002D4C50]
That is … quite direct. If you are sure, then you should know … it must be final. I will not have my heart broken again.

Id: [0x002D4C52]
Please, Eivor. Not now. Not with Sigurd there.

Id: [0x002D4C54]
I understand, Eivor. We all know these peaks and valleys, from time to time.

Id: [0x002D4C56]
Painful to hear, and painful to admit. But you may be right. It was … foolish of me to think it could lead somewhere.

Id: [0x002D4C57]
I must be direct, Randvi. Between you me, this will not work. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002D4C58]
I must be direct, Randvi. Between you and me, this will not work. I am sorry.

Id: [0x002D4C59]
Shall we…?

Id: [0x002D4C5A]
Shall we…?

Id: [0x002D4C5B]
No, forgive me. It was a moment of anxiety. Seeing you now has calmed me down.

Id: [0x002D4C5C]
No, forgive me. It was a moment of anxiety. Seeing you now has calmed me down.

Id: [0x002D4C5D]
I have long considered this. And I know it cannot work, not for me.

Id: [0x002D4C5E]
I have long considered this. And I know it cannot work, not for me.

Id: [0x002D4C5F]
I'm here, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D4C61]
Be gentle! I don't want it bruised!

Id: [0x002D4C62]
Use the flat of your blade!

Id: [0x002D4C63]
Perhaps a chokehold would do the trick?

Id: [0x002D4C65]
Stilling that bitter tongue was a service to all.

Id: [0x002D4C66]
Stilling that bitter tongue was a service to all.

Id: [0x002D4CD5]
What else can I do? I do not have it in me to fetch what remains of my poor Sphinxy. Her shrine will forever be incomplete.

Id: [0x002D4CD6]
Still mourning, hmm?

Id: [0x002D4CD7]
Still mourning, hmm?

Id: [0x002D4CE5]
And a home you can return to again. It may take some getting used to without Sphinxy, but her children need you.

Id: [0x002D4CE6]
And a home you can return to again. It may take some getting used to without Sphinxy, but her children need you.

Id: [0x002D4CE7]
And here I thought all Danes were ruthless plunderers. Murderers! You have a soul that would grace the heavens. Like my Sphinxy. Lord light your way.

Id: [0x002D4CF4]
Let us send them on their way, all our beloved dead, our fallen warriors. And speed them … to their end.

Id: [0x002D4CF5]
Let us send them on their way, all our beloved dead, our fallen warriors. And speed them … to their end.

You are safe now.

Id: [0x002D4CF8]
You are safe now.

Id: [0x002D4CF9]
Of Ragnarok, much is told, so here is a smaller tale of how the Jotun Hrym came to captain Naglfar, the Ship of Nails.

Id: [0x002D4CFA]
Hrym dwelt in Niflheim, where his task was to lay the dishonored dead under the ice. Hard work, for many die without honor.

Id: [0x002D4CFB]
One day, his master bade him bury one of the sons of Ymir, the frost giant from whose bones the world was made.

Id: [0x002D4CFC]
Hrym was a hard worker, but Ymir's son was the size of the mountain. Hrym laid down his spade, saying, "I cannot dig so much."

Id: [0x002D4CFD]
Hrym's master grew angry and picked up the spade himself. He dug and dug through Hel's ice until he made a hole deep enough.

Id: [0x002D4CFE]
But the hole opened up into the abyss that is Ginnungagap, swallowing Hrym's master whole. And Hrym took his master's place.

Id: [0x002D4CFF]
Now Hrym abides in Helheim, waiting to steer the Ship of the Dead through the Nine Worlds in the war at the end of days.

Id: [0x002D4D02]
The brute swallowed it! Now I will never know what that key unlocks.

Id: [0x002D4D03]
Friends, amid all this battle-music, how many of you still recall the first time you drew steel?

Id: [0x002D4D05]
I tell you that I do remember. [beat]The summer harvest. I was fourteen.

Id: [0x002D4D08]
Father sent me to find my sister, who was late to the threshing. She often went to the woods with her betrothed in those days.

Id: [0x002D4D09]
I found them near the blackberries, still holding hands. [beat]They were dead. Slain. I ran to raise the alarm, but far too late.

Id: [0x002D4D0A]
Black smoke curled over rooftops. The meadhall in flames. Thatched roofs burning, all the crofts and byres. Flesh too.

Id: [0x002D4D0C]
Raiders from the Erling clan came down the coast. A feud between our jarls, the cause long forgotten. Stolen cows, maybe.

Id: [0x002D4D0D]
My first stood above my father's body, his back to me. I saw the scythe, I did not think. I grabbed it and cut him down.

Id: [0x002D4D0F]
I have walked the road-of-red ever since, but at times, I wonder where I would be had the Erlings not come a-raiding that day.

Id: [0x002D4D13]
Fishing arrows! Now to catch something for Njal.

Id: [0x002D4D14]
Fishing arrows! Now to catch something for Njal.

Id: [0x002D4D2A]
You wolf-shirts, you drinkers of blood?

Id: [0x002D4D2F]
Wall-breakers! Born in battle's flood!

Id: [0x002D4D34]
We fight for glory, we shield-biters!

Id: [0x002D4D35]
We fight for glory, we shield-biters!

Id: [0x002D4D39]
It was a man called Kjotve the Cruel that brought me to these rain-soaked shores. You all know the name, of that I am certain.

Id: [0x002D4D3B]
Kjotve's men came for him when I was out hunting. I was not there to defend him.

Id: [0x002D4D3C]
And then when my brother Gurim also fell … I, like a coward, fled to England.

Id: [0x002D4D44]
Upon my return from Francia, I heard the news. Kjotve the Cruel is long dead. Slain by the hand of Eivor, the Wolf-Kissed one.

Id: [0x002D4D45]
I am glad my father's killer is dead. But gods, I wish I had been there to swing the axe myself.

Id: [0x002D4D4A]
Mmmm … mmm… mmmm.

Id: [0x002D4D50]
I often think on Estrid and my time in Essexe. I was almost a year younger and more foolhardy then.

Id: [0x002D4D55]
With me![berserker howl]

Id: [0x002D4D57]
I always wanted to fight a berserker. [laugh]And a white bear rug will make a fine trophy.

Id: [0x002D4D61]
We are but single threads, and who knows what pattern they weave.

Id: [0x002D4D64]
Dear Njal. You were always at my side, for the better years of my life. Why must it end like this?

Id: [0x002D4D65]
Once, the sight of her filled me with tempest. But those storms have calmed now.

Id: [0x002D4D66]
She did not giggle nor swoon like many girls I know. Wit was her weapon. She could unman you with one swipe of her tongue.

Id: [0x002D4D67]
But such grace. Such light. Freyja herself would not step with such elegance.

Id: [0x002D4D6A]
When I marry, I will take an equal. No more, no less. A woman worthy of me, as I will be of her.

Id: [0x002D4D71]
Estrid spoke often of the teachings of Christ. I found them cold and strange, hidden in word-tangles of a sacred tongue.

Id: [0x002D4D72]
The common folk do not even know the language they worship in. They listen, but do not understand.

Id: [0x002D4D73]
Despite that, it has captured many Norse minds. Often I wonder why.

Id: [0x002D4D74]
We Norse dream of doom and know we cannot avoid it. Those who do not die in battle face eternity in cold Hel.

Id: [0x002D4D75]
But the Christian god gives hope. Even the poor and meek will find paradise. He welcomes all if they only worship him.

Id: [0x002D4D7D]
But Christ is a god of peace, ill-suited to my nature. Odin is my guiding light. He, at least, is never boring.

Id: [0x002D4D7E]
I came to England too late, that is the problem. The Sons of Ragnar have shorn her of all possible glories.

Id: [0x002D4D83]
Everywhere I go, I find the footprints of men and women who were there before me.

Id: [0x002D4D84]
Other names but mine ring on the tongues of the skalds. Halfdan, Ubba, Guthrum. [mock resentment]And Eivor the Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D4D85]
This land is full. Its glories are spent. I need to look to other shores, where I will write my saga into history.

Id: [0x002D4D86]
In my first weeks, I gathered many men and took them reaving. I lost my heart to an ealdorman's wife, kidnapped her away.

Id: [0x002D4D87]
But even that was not enough to raise the name of Rollo above the clamor.

Id: [0x002D4D8C]
Did I tell you about the time I pretended to be a goat?

Id: [0x002D4D8E]
I am no stranger to the company of other's wives. But there was one beautiful wren, married to an Auld Blind Alwin.

Id: [0x002D4D8F]
I could not resist her. So when he fell asleep, ale-addled by the fire, she let me visit her most private chambers.

Id: [0x002D4D90]
She was a chirruping songbird, but I was the braying buck. Rousing the dead in my ecstasy.

Id: [0x002D4D92]
He dragged me by the hair, down on all fours to the barn, where he bolted it fast. I spent the night lying in straw and shit.

Id: [0x002D4D99]
I had an odd friend when I was boy. His name was Nori. And by the gods, that boy could lie!

Id: [0x002D4DA1]
The men of Wessex! They came from every house and hovel!

Id: [0x002D4DAB]
Word of our growing settlement has reached outside ears. So have a look around … you may see a few new faces.

Id: [0x002D4DAD]
We do not need this honor-cheat. We will complete the tower ourselves.

Id: [0x002D4DAE]
We do not need this honor-cheat. We will complete the tower ourselves.

Id: [0x002D4DB1]
True words. I shall try.

Id: [0x002D4DC6]
I may throw up, I may throw up, ugh!

Id: [0x002D4DC9]
There is no fight I will flee! And should the gods answer my call, so be it! They too will feel my wrath!

Id: [0x002D4DCC]
My belly hurts and I do not know why, agh!

Id: [0x002D4DD7]
Four dilly-dandies. Four stick standies. Two crookers. Two lookers. And a wig wag.

Id: [0x002D4DD8]
Dark were their tracks, the path very black. Swift was its moving, faster than birds. Yes, yes that's it.

Id: [0x002D4DD9]
A young and handsome peasant's daughter,<LF>She seizes me, red, plunders my head. [beat]O dear me no, what am I thinking?

Id: [0x002D4DE0]
What do you want to bet that she has the comb on her? Planning to drop it the minute she sees a man she wants.

Id: [0x002D4DE1]
…and if you come across a mud patch, lay down your furs for the lady to cross on.

Id: [0x002D4DEA]
[laughs]That nearly turned my insides out. O, I wish I could see the stir I've caused above.

Id: [0x002D4DEB]
As we agreed. Well? Have you nothing to say after such a forceful breaking of wind?

Id: [0x002D4DED]
[cough]It blew me away.

Id: [0x002D4DEE]
[cough]It blew me away.[cough]

Id: [0x002D4DF3]
Iva! Iva, wake up, you fool!

Id: [0x002D4DF4]
He can't hear you. Passed out cold.

Id: [0x002D4DF5]
She's right. You can tell by the pool of piss around his ankles, see? He won't come to for a while.

Id: [0x002D4DF6]
It's all right. We'll wait. That way he can watch while we skin you.

Id: [0x002D4DF7]
Never mind, Iva! Stay asleep! Sleep!

Id: [0x002D4DFC]
Untie me! Quick!

Id: [0x002D4E25]
What! No, please. Look at him! He is deadweight.

Id: [0x002D4E26]
You two again? Bent over the barrel of another adventure, I see.

Id: [0x002D4E27]
You two again? Bent over the barrel of another adventure, I see.

Id: [0x002D4E2A]
There is no "we" in this. Your brother, your problem.

Id: [0x002D4E2B]
There is no "we" in this. Your brother, your problem.

Id: [0x002D4E2C]
This is his fault! I told him they looked like bandits, but he insisted on cheating them out of coin.

Id: [0x002D4E2E]
Deader weight soon. You should hurry.

Id: [0x002D4E2F]
Deader weight soon. You should hurry.

Id: [0x002D4E30]
If I have to carry him, we will never make it out of here alive. Please!

Id: [0x002D4E33]
Think again, Saxon filth! There is no besting these Sons of Ragnar. Soon the world will know us by name!

Id: [0x002D4E34]
See this? Do. You. See it? This blade was forged by Grundel … Grundel Thundersmith! Greatest of all blacksmiths.

Id: [0x002D4E35]
One nick and your life essence will shoot out of you like a geyser from the depths of Norway.

Id: [0x002D4E36]
You laugh. Am I a joke to you? Do I look like a jester?

Id: [0x002D4E37]
That is what I thought! You will think again before laughing behind my back! No one laughs at me! No one!

Id: [0x002D4E3A]
Look there!

Id: [0x002D4E3C]
Stay close to me!

Id: [0x002D4E3D]
Stay close to me!

Id: [0x002D4E41]
Alright there?

Id: [0x002D4E43]
And who would that be, then?

Id: [0x002D4E45]
Well, that'd be why you en't found him. But you're free to pass the time just here if you like.

Id: [0x002D4E46]
Yes, hello. I do not mean to intrude but … I am looking for someone.

Id: [0x002D4E47]
Yes, hello. I do not mean to intrude but … I am looking for someone.

Id: [0x002D4E48]
I … I do not know exactly.

Id: [0x002D4E49]
I … I do not know exactly.

Id: [0x002D4E4C]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002D4E4D]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002D4E52]
This is where we part ways.

Id: [0x002D4E53]
This is where we part ways.

Id: [0x002D4EAC]
My saga is complete and it is the envy of all who came before and all who are yet to come!

Id: [0x002D4EAD]
There is no resisting this lasting legacy I have forged! A wise man said it best. To resist is to piss in the wind.

Id: [0x002D4EAE]
O, if my mother could see me now…

Id: [0x002D4EBC]
Ah! A brave steed has swept me up!

Id: [0x002D4EBD]
Onward, to my loyal companion!

Id: [0x002D4EBE]
I think I can no longer walk. Yes. It appears so.

Id: [0x002D4EBF]
Jeska. Where are you? I must find my way back to you!

Id: [0x002D4EC0]
I have been struck by a sudden wave of … tired … I am tired.

Id: [0x002D4EC2]
Have you seen the skald? He may still be under the effects of some mushrooms he ate.

Id: [0x002D4EC9]
My name is Erik Loyalskull. The great King Ragnar Lothbrok named me such, when we fought, tearing up the fields of England.

Id: [0x002D4ECA]
We are but six who remain, his most loyal drengir. Yet without his guiding light, his strength and vision, we are lost.

Id: [0x002D4ECC]
I did not die beside my lord in Aella's pit of snakes. But I can make amends. Fight me, warrior. Send me to meet him in Odin's hall.

Id: [0x002D4ECD]
Please. Indulge me with the honor of my death.

Id: [0x002D4ECE]
You're a long way from any warm hearth, warrior. Is this where you call home?

Id: [0x002D4ECF]
You are a long way from any warm hearth, warrior. Is this where you call home?

Id: [0x002D4F04]
Stop thanking me and listen closely. This life does not suit you.

Id: [0x002D4F05]
Stop thanking me and listen closely. This life does not suit you.

Id: [0x002D4F06]
Yes! My … my thanks. Thank you.

If your idiot brother hatches another one of his glory seeking plans, take your fist and slam it right between his eyes.

Id: [0x002D4F0D]
This I have realized…

Id: [0x002D4F0F]
Or better yet, punch him in his cock. He will listen.

Id: [0x002D4F10]
Or better yet, punch him in his cock. He will listen.

Id: [0x002D4F11]
Punch his cock. Yes. That should get the point across. Thank you… Err, you will never see us again.

Id: [0x002D4F13]
Good.

Id: [0x002D4F14]
Good.

Id: [0x002D4F1D]
What happened? Were you bit?

Id: [0x002D4F1E]
What happened? Were you bit?

Id: [0x002D4F1F]
O, yes. Snakebit. Just like you!

Id: [0x002D4F20]
Attack!

Id: [0x002D4F2D]
Feeble.

Id: [0x002D4F2E]
Feeble.

Id: [0x002D4F68]
My first day defending the walls of Grantebridge, my duty was defense. I had asked for this task myself.

Id: [0x002D4F69]
As I patrolled the walls, I sang and banged my shield against the ribs of the walls. I woke half the camp with my wailing.

Id: [0x002D4F6A]
I sang from the Eddas as Galinn, Lif, and Soma threw rocks at me. They thought me too frivolous. Until the day I caught a spy.

Id: [0x002D4F6B]
Some filthy shadow-walker trying to rob us. Of what, only Loki knows. Galinn killed him before he could be tried.

Id: [0x002D4F6C]
My point is … always be loud. Act a fool, be a nuisance! It is your greatest defense.

Id: [0x002D4F6D]
I love being in love. I love the ache of love, the turmoil of love. My parents taught me that. To love love.

Id: [0x002D4F70]
He always said, beyond the complex lives of gods are these simple truths. We forget. And it takes tragedy to get them back.

Id: [0x002D4F71]
So many men forget to hug. My father would go by every hut in our village every night with mead and hugs. I would do the same.

Id: [0x002D4F72]
He said this too, hugs are hugs. Mead is mead. Love is love. Gods, I miss him. I see him sometimes, his face leaping from the waves.

Id: [0x002D4F84]
You have some weight on you.

Id: [0x002D4F85]
You have some weight on you.

Id: [0x002D4F8A]
[laugh]It was not me alone. My friends and I won them. We call ourselves the Toothbreakers.

Id: [0x002D4F8C]
Sadly, we were separated. By a beast, of a kind we have never seen. In one fell swoop, it tore our group apart.

Id: [0x002D4F8D]
We are supposed to meet here, to hunt that creature before returning home. And so, I wait.

Id: [0x002D4F8F]
Safe travels, and watch the woods.

Id: [0x002D4F90]
Quite a number you've taken.

Id: [0x002D4F91]
Quite a number you've taken.

Id: [0x002D4F94]
Wait in safety, then.

Id: [0x002D4F95]
Wait in safety, then.

Id: [0x002D4F96]
It took me another season to muster the desire to go whaling again.

Id: [0x002D4F99]
He claimed we might believe differently in who sits amongst the clouds, but our beliefs are not so different in nature.

Id: [0x002D4F9C]
During my time in East Anglia, Aethelred, the king that lived for a brief time before Oswald, asked a secret favor of me.

Id: [0x002D4F9D]
He needed a ship, one to ferry some stolen goods from the ports of Jorvik to East Anglia. Said it was urgent.

Id: [0x002D4F9F]
I had done many such runs for Halfdan in my day and was not afraid. But something about this run made me uneasy. Still, I went.

Id: [0x002D4FA0]
The moment we docked our boats and entered Jorvik's underbelly, the contact we met hastily handed us some heavy crates!

Id: [0x002D4FA1]
And just as we loaded up, we noticed hooded figures at the end of the alley. They started to nock flaming arrows.

Id: [0x002D4FA4]
I had seen enough and we shoved off. Hoisted the sails and headed fast for open water. I looked back at our contact.

Id: [0x002D4FA5]
He was now face down in the water, stuck with arrows, his body aflame. What by Odin's beard had filled these crates?

Id: [0x002D4FA6]
Lo and behold, it was books. Piles of Christian tomes. Such madness. Who knew Aethelred valued something more than ale?

Id: [0x002D4FBC]
This beast bested us last time. We should be on our guard.

Id: [0x002D4FC8]
Iah nowén:ton tékken kí:ken ión:kwe.[I have never seen this one before.]

Id: [0x002D4FCE]
Oh kwah niiawen'hátie'? Ó:ia ión:kwe iah kèn:'en tekanákere' onkwaná:takon ísewe's. [Another stranger in our village, what's going on?]

Id: [0x002D4FD8]
So, what brings you here, kinsman? Was it the pull of the wilderness, the thrill of the hunt?

Id: [0x002D4FDA]
Then you will not be disappointed! However, be warned. This beast is quick to bite, and fearless.

Id: [0x002D4FDB]
You could say that.

Id: [0x002D4FDC]
You could say that.

Id: [0x002D4FDD]
[imitating a bear growl]Grr!

Id: [0x002D4FDE]
Ack! [pause]Hey!

Id: [0x002D4FDF]
Please, can we get along? Your horseplay will be our death.

Id: [0x002D4FE0]
I want to join, but my wife won't have it! Should I leave her?

Id: [0x002D4FE1]
I am heavy with sin! I need guidance!

Id: [0x002D4FE2]
How can I believe when the Danes are knocking at our doors?

Id: [0x002D4FF5]
Arne … o well. He lasted the longest, amongst the rest.

Id: [0x002D4FF6]
Now, we can finally return home with our head high!

Id: [0x002D4FF8]
He seems eager to trade goods and wares.

Id: [0x002D4FF9]

Our friends healed me with their berries. I am grateful.

Id: [0x002D5004]
Your teeth will look nice on a string around my neck!

Id: [0x002D5010]
I had good help, too.

Id: [0x002D5014]
Their teeth, their fur… I thought I was going to the halls.

Id: [0x002D5015]
I cannot believe your trick worked.

Id: [0x002D5019]
Arne, you are going to do just fine. Your skills will help us in the battle ahead! He will, right?

Id: [0x002D501A]
Yes. Sure.

Id: [0x002D501D]
That worked out well for us the last time.

Id: [0x002D5021]
So, what is the plan?

Id: [0x002D5022]
To charge in headfirst, attack by surprise!

Id: [0x002D5023]
No, we should be more careful this time. We track it, then we corner it.

Id: [0x002D5025]
Fire!

Id: [0x002D5026]
Fire!

Id: [0x002D5028]
We were stuck in a cave in the mountains hiding from a snowstorm. The bear was meant for the village, but we had first pickings.

Id: [0x002D5029]
But Solveig, a local oaf, he just ripped the flank off the bear and tossed it into a pot meant for vegetables. Left it there for an afternoon!

Id: [0x002D5051]
Lying is not a good way to get my attention, children.

I am nearing Werham, deep into Aelfred's heartland. I hope Guthrum has a sound plan.

What are you playing at?

Id: [0x002D51A5]
Gah! Any more and I'll drown.

Id: [0x002D51A6]
Gah! Any more and I'll drown.

Id: [0x002D51E0]
I'll be the one to find it. Just you wait and see.

Id: [0x002D51E4]
Otta hits rocks as far as the eye can see!

Id: [0x002D51EA]
I saw an angel swallow the last rock you hit, I swear I did, Otta!

Id: [0x002D51EB]
Have I walked into another realm?

Id: [0x002D51EC]
Have I walked into another realm?

Id: [0x002D51F2]
My favorite part of any battle is the moment before it. Everyone has their ritual in that flutter of anticipation. Our hearts race!

Id: [0x002D51F3]
Soma would visit the children of the camp. Recount an old myth, like a wise skald. She filled those little ones with courage.

Id: [0x002D51F4]
She knew they desired a chance to fight in great battles. One day. And if we did not win, they would not have their chance.

Id: [0x002D51F5]
Once I followed her on this ritual and watched her speak. To keep things fun, she often mixed up the old myths.

Id: [0x002D51F6]
Those little eyes, the children's faces … aflame. Enamored. I saw myself as one of them. I felt so much better.

Id: [0x002D51F7]
Soma has that way with people. She has that way with me. She need only tell a story or two, and the war is already won.

Id: [0x002D51FB]
I think this is yours.

Id: [0x002D51FC]
I think this is yours.

Id: [0x002D5202]
O, please don't fall.

Id: [0x002D5207]
Hold tight. Just hold on tight.

Id: [0x002D5217]
I often wonder, who deserves it, the largest cup of mead at the feast. Valka because she heals? The chosen dynasty of Styrbjornssons?

Id: [0x002D5218]
The others, they are like clubs. Blunt and ungainly, you are nimble, like a knife.

Id: [0x002D521A]
I was married once. My Alfi died five winters back. Ours was a perfect marriage. I do not need another.

Id: [0x002D521B]
But, am I to go the rest of my days without love or attention? I think not.

Id: [0x002D521D]
Could be a comb, could be a brooch, or an arm ring. So long as it's lost and to be found by a helping hand.

Id: [0x002D521E]
Are you so in need of suitors that any passing woodsman or vikingr will do?

Id: [0x002D521F]
Are you so in need of suitors that any passing woodsman or vikingr will do?

Id: [0x002D5220]
And the comb?

Id: [0x002D5221]
And the comb?

Id: [0x002D5222]
You are different than the kind my flights of fancy attract. Burdened, decorated and … delicate.

Id: [0x002D5226]
Or Bragi who sits on a throne of his own, here on this river-steed? Should he get his ale before we all drink?

Id: [0x002D5227]
Or do our lips all hit the mug at the same time? This brings to mind an old myth, no longer told, of Olaf the Meadblood.

Id: [0x002D5228]
His mead was too good, all wished to drink it. But none knew that his secret ingredient was a tiny dram of ox blood.

Id: [0x002D5229]
But one day, he decided to feed a sip of mead to his favored ox. Yet the blood he used for that batch was his own.

Id: [0x002D522A]
"It is only fair," he said. But this angered the Jarl Thorgnar, who wanted a quaff of the mead before the generous animal.

Id: [0x002D522B]
To avoid serving his own blood, Olaf served ordinary mead, but it was bland and Thorgnar spit it to the floor. Olaf was ashamed.

Id: [0x002D522D]
There is a hidden lesson here, of course. I will leave it to you to work it out for yourselves.

Id: [0x002D522F]
Halt in your search! A winner, and my comb has been found.

Id: [0x002D5231]
We await your signal, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D5235]
Good. Go to the main gate. We will regroup there when Werham is burned.

Id: [0x002D5236]
Good. Go to the main gate. We will regroup there when Werham is burned.

Id: [0x002D5237]
Eivor, we stand ready for your signal.

Id: [0x002D5239]
Stand firm all. Do not lose your nerve.

Id: [0x002D523B]
Good work, we leave now. There are forest ruins just east of here, along the road. [beat]Come on, men, move!

Id: [0x002D523E]
This place is routed, Soma!

Id: [0x002D523F]
This place is routed, Soma!

Id: [0x002D5241]
I beg you. There is no need for this to go where I feel you think it should.

Id: [0x002D5242]
Children, stop saying such things. I do not want to use it.

Id: [0x002D5243]
These children have made me curious. Your calm demeanor even more so.

Id: [0x002D5244]
These children have made me curious. Your calm demeanor even more so.

Id: [0x002D5246]
Now, the prize for finding my comb is some of my time. A walk in nature, maybe more if that is where our conversation takes us.

Id: [0x002D5247]
Ugh… Neither of us will enjoy this, I am afraid.

Id: [0x002D5254]
Nooo! No!

Id: [0x002D5255]
Nooo! No!

Id: [0x002D526E]
Ah!

Id: [0x002D5274]
Brother?

Id: [0x002D5275]
Brother?

Id: [0x002D527D]
Thank you for the offer, but I cannot. Here, your comb.

Id: [0x002D527E]
Thank you for the offer, but I cannot. Here, your comb.

Id: [0x002D527F]
You keep it. It was a reward for my champion. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D5283]
My shoulders are tense, and my hair is a tangle. I could use a softer touch for these kinks.

Id: [0x002D5284]
My shoulders are tense, and my hair is a tangle. I could use a softer touch for these kinks.

Id: [0x002D5285]
Then let me.

Id: [0x002D5289]
Thank you, Bil. You tamed some knots I haven't been able to reach myself.

Id: [0x002D528A]
Thank you, Bil. You tamed some knots I haven't been able to reach myself.

Id: [0x002D528B]
Hm-hm. Delicate touch, indelicate voice. This was fun, Eivor. Hold onto the comb, as a keepsake.

Id: [0x002D528F]
Moo. (I am sad.)

Id: [0x002D5291]
Moo. (O, how nice.)

Id: [0x002D5293]
Moo. (I feel you.)

Id: [0x002D5295]
Moo. (Thank you and good luck, godling.)

Id: [0x002D529B]
You there, Dane! Who deserves more, the worker who makes the barley or he who actually sells it?

Id: [0x002D529E]
I will let you drink my famous ale from my famous barley. "Sebbi's Slush," they call it in town. They do!

Id: [0x002D52BB]
Slake your thirst, Man-Maker. May you bring forth new things to amaze us all.

Id: [0x002D52BC]
Slake your thirst, Man-Maker. May you bring forth new things to amaze us all.

Id: [0x002D52BF]
Help me! Help! Please!

Id: [0x002D52C3]
You and your foul brothers and sisters have churned the very soil of this sacred land. No more!

Id: [0x002D52C4]
You're going back north where you belong!

Id: [0x002D52C5]
We will rid England of your kind for good!

Id: [0x002D52CA]
Leave me to my ambrosia of mud and might! Soon my clan of mud warriors will enlist me again in a new war.

Id: [0x002D52CF]
My thanks, for your contribution.

Id: [0x002D52D0]
My thanks, for your contribution.

Id: [0x002D52F0]
You! What are you doing in here?

Id: [0x002D52F1]
Good day to you, stranger.

Id: [0x002D52F2]
Eivor?

Id: [0x002D52F3]
Welcome to my kingdom, wandering lord! I seek an alliance, one to benefit us both!

Id: [0x002D52F4]
This is the island kingdom of Norsexe! I am King Egwald himself, lord and protector of this verdant land.

Id: [0x002D52F5]
Please … I seek a strong union to establish my kingdom.

Id: [0x002D52F9]
Nothing to speak of. He, uh, did not care for me trading with the villagers here. Beat me and put me in chains.

Id: [0x002D52FA]
I slipped away, free! Not so unlucky, am I? Still alive. Yes, still alive.

Id: [0x002D52FB]
I saw signs of a struggle at your camp. Did something happen between you and Gorm?

Id: [0x002D52FC]
I saw signs of a struggle at your camp. Did something happen between you and Gorm?

Id: [0x002D52FF]
The leader of this bridge cliff camp may know Gorm's whereabouts.

Why is this place so heavily guarded? What are you hiding, Gorm?

Id: [0x002D5302]
Why is this place so heavily guarded? What are you hiding, Gorm?

Id: [0x002D5306]
Would you like to baa-uy some expertly made yule goats?

Id: [0x002D530D]
Sis, this nice stranger bought our goats.

Id: [0x002D532C]
I have done enough.

Id: [0x002D532D]
I have done enough.

Id: [0x002D5336]
Come one, come all! Norse and Saxons alike! Newly blessed food, made and touched with our Lord's holy grace!

Id: [0x002D5337]
I'd have an ale in my fist and a lass on my knee.

Id: [0x002D533C]
Gorm Kjotvesson.

Id: [0x002D533D]
Gorm Kjotvesson.

Id: [0x002D5341]
A-ha! The thief came by! I am on the trail!

Id: [0x002D5342]
O-ho, the thief must be near now. I recognize my pie's allure to any nose!

Id: [0x002D5345]
Come out, thief! I know you are here, I can smell my pie!

Id: [0x002D5348]
Ah!

Id: [0x002D534A]
Caught, scoundrel. Now, give my delicious pie back.

Id: [0x002D534B]
Ready to lift an oar on our long voyage back to England?

Id: [0x002D534D]
Well … it does smell spectacular. You have a keen sense for the culinary arts, child. You want a job?

Id: [0x002D534E]
God's piss of luck! Thank you so much. You won't regret it, I have so many ideas.

Id: [0x002D534F]
[grunt]Just stop stealing the pies.

Id: [0x002D5350]
It seems like this child would make an extraordinary baker, and Jorvik could use one less thief.

Id: [0x002D5351]
It seems like this child would make an extraordinary baker, and Jorvik could use one less thief.

Id: [0x002D5354]
Eivor, you return to us.

Id: [0x002D5359]
I do.

Id: [0x002D535A]
I do.

Id: [0x002D535B]
The ruins are close, keep moving!

Id: [0x002D535D]
The swell of those rolling hills. The way the sunlight dapples the forest floor.

Id: [0x002D5363]
Good! We will pay back the Saxons for the insults they heaped on us.

Id: [0x002D5364]
There! These are my men!

Id: [0x002D5365]
I told you Guthrum wouldn't leave us here to rot.

Id: [0x002D5366]
Go to the camp near Cippenhamm. Find your countrymen there.

Id: [0x002D5367]
Go to the camp near Cippenhamm. Find your countrymen there.

Id: [0x002D5369]
One day, I'd had enough. I decided to play a trick on him.

Id: [0x002D5374]
We will not be feasting in Odin's hall tonight, boys!

Id: [0x002D5375]
There is a camp set up north by Cippenhamm. Go there!

Id: [0x002D5376]
As long as I can cut some Saxons down, I don't care where we face them.

Id: [0x002D5377]
Guthrum! Some of your men!

Id: [0x002D5378]
Guthrum! Some of your men!

Id: [0x002D5379]
He and my father, Rognvald, had some disagreements. But my father was never one to bow his head and keep silent.

Id: [0x002D537B]
No, but we must keep looking.

Id: [0x002D537C]
I had to hand them over. Aelfred demanded it.

Id: [0x002D537E]
Do you think he kept his word? He swore he would not kill them.

Id: [0x002D5380]
Can you see your men?

Id: [0x002D5381]
Can you see your men?

Id: [0x002D5382]
We will save them, Guthrum. Stay calm.

Id: [0x002D5383]
We will save them, Guthrum. Stay calm.

Id: [0x002D5384]
I cannot say for certain, just hope we find them soon.

Id: [0x002D5385]
I cannot say for certain, just hope we find them soon.

Id: [0x002D5387]
Her gaze blinded me. Her words cut me down, raised me up. Made me a wolf, a lamb, a babe, a sage.

Id: [0x002D538B]
Thank you, Eivor. You did a great deed here. Their families will raise a cup to you.

Id: [0x002D538D]
I need no thanks, Guthrum. Let us speak more when we are safely away.

Id: [0x002D538E]
I need no thanks, Guthrum. Let us speak more when we are safely away.

Id: [0x002D5391]
At the moment of glory, the old man burst in on us waving his crop. He struck me on the arse and I gave a yelp!

Id: [0x002D5393]
She convinced Auld Blind Alwin it was not a man in her room, but his prize goat, escaped from its pen.

Id: [0x002D539B]
Still the best night of my life.

Id: [0x002D539D]
KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE!

Id: [0x002D539E]
KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE! KJOTVE!

Id: [0x002D53BB]
Where are you going, Brother? You must tell the details of this great victory.

Id: [0x002D53BC]
I am going home!

Id: [0x002D53C1]
Thank the good Lord! Baptized again, my beautiful Degolas!

Id: [0x002D53C4]
Aye! Free us and we will fight by your side.

Id: [0x002D53C5]
Every Saxon who spat at me will die.

Id: [0x002D53C7]
Are you Guthrum's men?

Id: [0x002D53C8]
Are you Guthrum's men?

Id: [0x002D53C9]
You will have your chance, but don't be foolhardy. Let your steps take you far from here to our camp near Cippanhamm.

Id: [0x002D53CA]
You will have your chance, but don't be foolhardy. Let your steps take you far from here to our camp near Cippanhamm.

Id: [0x002D53DC]
Who am I to trick a trickster? Come, Havi, are you a prick and a coward? Grant my wish, you soft-cock!

Id: [0x002D53DD]
That is an unfair fight. I cannot win, and you cannot survive.

Id: [0x002D53DE]
That is an unfair fight. I cannot win, and you cannot survive.

Id: [0x002D53DF]
Go!

Id: [0x002D53E0]
Yes, good. Come, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D53E1]
Good.

Id: [0x002D53E2]
Told us his father traded with the elves. Told us he had kissed sweet Hannah. Said he had seen a giant in the woods.

Id: [0x002D53E3]
Well, one day we decided we would see about him. So we dared him to take us to the place he saw the giant.

Id: [0x002D53E4]
He twisted and turned, but at last he agreed. The thing is, I had been out there already.

Id: [0x002D53E5]
I had taken up a big rock and made footprints in the soft earth. Heels and toes. Giant's feet.

Id: [0x002D53E7]
When he saw those prints, he went white as a virgin's britches. Everyone made out they were scared. And then…

Id: [0x002D53E8]
"WHO'S THAT WALKING THROUGH MY WOOD?" I howled from the trees, and I thrashed the branches all around.

Id: [0x002D53EA]
Nori screamed like a maiden and took to his heels. By the smell of it, he emptied his arse on the way.

Id: [0x002D53EB]
He told us, afterwards, he knew it was a trick, but he never did go near those woods again.

Id: [0x002D53ED]
Only time will tell. Be well, stranger.

Id: [0x002D53EF]
Well, I am certain your arrows will still fly true, you did not lose your archer's skill.

Id: [0x002D53F0]
Well, I'm certain your arrows will still fly true, you did not lose your archer's skill.

Id: [0x002D53F3]
These Saxons do not deserve compassion. I will wash my blade in their blood.

Id: [0x002D53F8]
[snore]…Must stay awake … they could be anywhere…[snore]

Id: [0x002D53FA]
[snore]…They are everywhere … if we die, everyone dies…[snore]

Id: [0x002D53FC]
[snore]…Must not fall asleep … need to see them coming…[snore]

Id: [0x002D53FE]
Thank you. You have earned your title as wise. I will fight in your honor, and keep your name clean in my mouth.

Id: [0x002D53FF]
Then take that memory with you. Hold it as an ember against your chest until Ragnarok. At the end of all things, you will see her.

Id: [0x002D5400]

Id: [0x002D5401]
When this oaf served up his boiled bear, another man, Njall, he sliced his piece down the center and wore it for a shoe! Ha!

Id: [0x002D5442]
These men will not surrender! And one little cock-flogger barricaded himself behind that door there.

Id: [0x002D5444]
Guthrum! I need you fighting with the rest.

Id: [0x002D5445]
Guthrum! I need you fighting with the rest.

Id: [0x002D544F]
Eivor! The garrison has more defenders than we hoped. My men are being slaughtered.

Id: [0x002D5454]
No. But your Saxon boys were ambushed. One lays wounded.

Id: [0x002D5456]
Did you see Aelfred?

Id: [0x002D5457]
Did you see Aelfred?

Id: [0x002D545D]
I … I cannot. And there is a blackness closing in around my eyes. It frightens me.

Id: [0x002D545E]
Forgive me, Hunwald. I should have been quicker.

Id: [0x002D5462]
I will carry him from the fray. To that farmhouse there.

Id: [0x002D5463]
I will carry him from the fray. To that farmhouse there.

Id: [0x002D5478]
That was nice! Hope we can do it again.

Id: [0x002D547A]
Well done! Not many have beaten me. But I think in a rematch, I'll trounce you.

Id: [0x002D547D]
Curses! You're a lucky one, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D5480]
Your jealousy is adorable.

Id: [0x002D5483]
I will see you later. And keep you in my thoughts.

Id: [0x002D5484]
I will see you later. And keep you in my thoughts.

Id: [0x002D5485]
Happy to. I'll see you later.

Id: [0x002D5486]
Happy to. I will see you later.

Id: [0x002D5487]
Think whatever you like, Tarben my dear. The proof stands.

Id: [0x002D5488]
Think whatever you like, Tarben my dear. The proof stands.

Id: [0x002D5489]
That was … very impressive. And strangely appealing.

Id: [0x002D548A]
That was … very impressive. And strangely appealing.

Id: [0x002D548B]
I was thinking the same thing.

Id: [0x002D548C]
I was thinking the same thing.

Id: [0x002D548D]
Luck was on your side tonight, Tarben.

Id: [0x002D548E]
Luck was on your side tonight, Tarben.

Id: [0x002D549F]
Such a joy to see you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D54A0]
Eivor, I was eager to see you.

Id: [0x002D54A1]
Hello, love. Always nice to see your face.

Id: [0x002D54A9]
Is that so? Well, I … I hope you've thought this through. Are you sure?

Id: [0x002D54AB]
I see. Then do what your heart bids. I will recover. And I hope we may remain friends.

Id: [0x002D54AD]
I too have been tested by our distance. But worry not. We can make it work.

Id: [0x002D54B5]
Apologies, but I must go. I only wanted to say a quick greeting.

Id: [0x002D54B6]
Apologies, but I must go. I only wanted to say a quick greeting.

Id: [0x002D54B7]
How about a drinking contest? With the forewarning that I am very good at drinking.

Id: [0x002D54B8]

The game is dice. You against me.

My dear Tarben … I'm afraid that our romance may have run its course. I cannot do this any longer.

Id: [0x002D54BC]
My dear Tarben … I'm afraid that our romance may have run its course. I … cannot do this any longer.

Id: [0x002D54BD]
I am. I must be true to my heart and end this.

Id: [0x002D54BE]
I am. I must be true to my heart and end this.

Id: [0x002D54BF]
I'm sorry. I meant only that I was concerned. Given how much I am away, I worried that we could not make this work.

Id: [0x002D54C0]
I'm sorry. I meant only that I was concerned. Given how much I am away, I … I worried that we could not make this work.

Id: [0x002D54C1]
Just a thought … if you had some time, would you spend a little of it with me?

Id: [0x002D54C2]
Just a thought … if you had some time, would you spend a little of it with me?

Id: [0x002D54C3]
I would like that.

Id: [0x002D54C4]
I would like that.

Id: [0x002D54C8]
True. Very true.

Id: [0x002D54EC]
But one day, she decided to hop into my arms. A sign, I thought! She had chosen me as her master! I vowed to look after her.

Id: [0x002D54EE]
My young heart sang. I had always wanted a pet of sorts. So I stashed her in a corner of the house when father wasn't looking.

Id: [0x002D54EF]
Ingrid settled in nicely into her makeshift nest I made. But morning came and I couldn't find her!

Id: [0x002D54F0]
Father called me over to the table more eagerly than usual. And there she was. Poor Ingrid, boiled and butchered on a plate.

Id: [0x002D54F1]
"It's not every day the gods bless us with an easy meal," Father boomed. "But this one wandering right into the house! Now eat!"

Id: [0x002D54F2]
I sat and ate my meal in silence. [beat]Ingrid was delicious.

Id: [0x002D54F3]
Where we might have lived, what livestock we would have raised. A simple life, I hope. Out of the shadows of our heritage.

Id: [0x002D54F4]
Words I vowed to never hear again. So I never ran again, from anything. I stand and fight, always prepared to die.

Id: [0x002D54F7]
Burn the draugrs before they rise!

Id: [0x002D54F8]
Will they truly rest? You said the draugrs, your family no less, would return vengeful.

Id: [0x002D54F9]
Will they truly rest? You said the draugrs, your family no less, would return vengeful.

Id: [0x002D54FB]
Some years ago, I took to sea with a sword-dancer called Egil. A brooding warrior with a face of stone and oak-hard arms.

Id: [0x002D54FC]
On a raid in Courland, we shored up along the edge of a forest and explored until we came to peopled parts. A large farm.

Id: [0x002D54FD]
It was night and all were asleep, so we set about plundering the place in the quiet of eve, taking sheep and goats as we pleased.

Id: [0x002D54FE]
It was then that Egil saw a farmhand and pressed the boy for the family's hidden silver. The farmhand squawked like a crow.

Id: [0x002D54FF]
Being hid beneath an anvil at the smith's forge, the silver was no trouble to lift. In secret, we took it and the boy back to the ship.

Id: [0x002D5500]
It was then that Egil grew sad, for when the farmers woke with the crack of day, they would know they had been robbed, but not by whom.

Id: [0x002D5501]
So Egil ordered three of us to follow him, back to the sleep-hushed hamlet. As we burned the houses, Egil shouted his name…

Id: [0x002D5502]
"I am Egil, Son of Skallagrim! And I am the man who deprives you of everything but your life!" I never sailed with Egil again.

Id: [0x002D5504]
Here is a tale to tickle your sides. The winter before, I was drinking in Stavanger with some companions.

Id: [0x002D5505]
With us in the meadhall were men of Bard Jarl's clan, one of which was a poet named Halli, called Sarcastic Halli by most.

Id: [0x002D5506]
Seven ale-horns into his night, Halli stood upon his table and called across the room to another man, a skald named Thjodolf.

Id: [0x002D5507]
"Thjodolf!" he yelled, "I can compose a more beautiful poem with my belching than you could with your tongue and fine words!"

Id: [0x002D5508]
The room laughed, Thjodolf loudest of all. "I accept your challenge, Sarcastic Halli," he shouted. "Allow me to begin!"

Id: [0x002D5509]
Thjodolf then spoke this verse: "Sad Halli drowns in horns of hubris, squeaking like a stoat, yet proudly the pup calls it poetry!"

Id: [0x002D550A]
The room laughed again, with Halli joining in. Then Halli tripped across the room and opened his mouth to speak his verse.

Id: [0x002D550B]
From his throat erupted a jet of vomit, into Thjodolf's face … his only composition that night, of which he seemed most proud.

Id: [0x002D550D]
In the early days of the feud between Kjotve the Cruel and the Raven Clan, there was a mad berserker called Kiarr Rawbone.

Id: [0x002D550E]
Kiarr had pledged his battle-fury to no king or jarl, and would give his oath only once each winter for reasons nobody could fathom.

Id: [0x002D550F]
One year, Kiarr's sister, Thora, was married to Kjotve's brother, Alrek, and soon Kiarr was often seen in the company of that clan.

Id: [0x002D5510]
But soon after, word came to Kiarr that Alrek had abused his sister. When he asked Thora about this, she told him, "It is true."

Id: [0x002D5511]
So Kiarr invited Alrek on a hunting expedition. And when they were away, Kiarr slew Alrek and pulled off one of his arms.

Id: [0x002D5512]
When he returned to camp, Kjotve asked where his brother was. Kiarr shook his head and held out his hand, in which was an arm ring.

Id: [0x002D5513]
"Your brother bid me give you this ring, Kjotve." Confused, Kjotve took the ring. And with it came the entire bloody arm.

Id: [0x002D5514]
"Your brother pledged his oath to Hel herself," Kiarr laughed. Then he turned and departed. He was never seen in those parts again.

Id: [0x002D5516]
When I was eleven winters old, I was the youngest of my favorite cousins, a wild and rowdy bunch of boys and girls.

Id: [0x002D5517]
Together with our parents, we attended a feast at the home of Halfdan the Black, of the house of Yngling.

Id: [0x002D5518]
To toughen our patience, our parents set us with the old woman who ordered us to bake flatbreads and serve it to the noble jarls.

Id: [0x002D5519]
After an hour, the flatbreads piled so high into pillars you could have built a roof over it and called it a longhouse.

Id: [0x002D551A]
When our work was done, an older boy, Guthrod, suggested we steal a keg of mead and drown in happiness for our good work.

Id: [0x002D551B]
So Guthrod and Mikkel and Osa snuck into the storeroom and stole a barrel as I stood watch. But when we were spotted, I froze.

Id: [0x002D551C]
Three of Harald's men stopped us. They struck Guthrod and Mikkel and pushed Osa to the ground. "Whose idea was this?" they asked.

Id: [0x002D551D]
I stood and said, "The idea was mine, the mead is for me!" One of the men eyed me and said only, "That is not true." Then they moved on.

Id: [0x002D551F]
A story from my youth, this one has no lesson to be learned or message to be gleaned.

Id: [0x002D5520]
Often my father liked to take me on hunts in the forested lands east of Avaldsnes. I loved these solitary times with him.

Id: [0x002D5521]
I had never felled a beast myself, and my father saw that this upset me. I was only a boy, but I had the dreams of being a man.

Id: [0x002D5522]
So one winter, my father asked me to perform a bargaining ritual to the Goddess Skadi, to improve his bow-skill and snow-sight.

Id: [0x002D5523]
With glee warming my heart, I caught a hare and sacrificed it to the goddess, asking an exchange of skill and sight for my father.

Id: [0x002D5524]
When the ritual was done, my father and I set off into the forest. We hunted all day until night fell. And we slew no game.

Id: [0x002D5525]
That night, around the fire, I was sullen. My sacrifice had not been heeded. Yet seeing my sad face, my father only smiled.

Id: [0x002D5526]
"Had you been hunting," he said, "You would have killed six fine deer. For Skadi hears only those who speak to her."

Id: [0x002D5528]
During my nineteenth winter, King Styrbjorn ordered the construction of a new longhouse, the splendid hall you now see at Fornberg.

Id: [0x002D5529]
To build this longhouse, he employed the help of twenty men. I was among them, as was Frathi, the strongest and stoutest man I had ever seen.

Id: [0x002D552A]
We set about felling trees and hewing wood for timber. Frathi was the fastest of us, dropping forty-one trees in only two days.

Id: [0x002D552B]
On the third day, a spindly man called Nar was near upon felling his first tree. He had hacked it all the way around like some mad animal.

Id: [0x002D552C]
When the tree fell, it did so in a direction he had not wished, straight down upon Frathi. Nar called out, but it was too late.

Id: [0x002D552D]
Frathi had only enough time to turn and face the doom bearing down upon him. With that he raised his arms to embrace the timber-hammer.

Id: [0x002D552E]
The force of the tree's falling drove Frathi deep into the snow bank, yet his arms never let go. He held that angry trunk as a lover.

Id: [0x002D552F]
Like hounds, we scooped at the snow to reach him. We found Frathi ten feet down, alive but in pain, still bearing the tree upon his shoulder.

Id: [0x002D5531]
Onarr the Ugly was an excellent sailor, who could pilot a longship entirely on his own, and this is why King Sigvaldi kept him around.

Id: [0x002D5532]
In all other matters, Onarr was a cruel, anxious, and humorless man. He was one of the most unlikable people I have ever known.

Id: [0x002D5533]
One year, I recall we had invited some karls from the Yngling Clan to dine with us. As we were serving ale, we came to find that we had none left.

Id: [0x002D5534]
It so happened that the ale had run out just before reaching Onarr's horn. This raised in him a word-storm, and he accused Sigvaldi of treachery.

Id: [0x002D5535]
Every man in the longhouse jeered at Onarr for raising such a fuss. This made Onarr angrier than before, and he stormed out.

Id: [0x002D5536]
A short time later we heard him yelling through door of the hall, "I set this scorn pole upon the men of Yngling for their dishonor!"

Id: [0x002D5537]
We looked outside and saw that Onarr had severed one of the heads of the Yngling's horses and stuck it upon a hazel branch.

Id: [0x002D5538]
When he saw us gathering at the door, the Yngling karls among us, Onarr panicked and ran. He was not seen for many months.

Id: [0x002D553A]
I knew a crazed man about my age called Rokr, who we had taken to calling Rokr the Rodent for his habit of collecting axes.

Id: [0x002D553B]
For twenty years he collected axes of all make and size. He had never seen a day of battle, but he swore to Thor that he would.

Id: [0x002D553C]
In his thirty-first year, after drinking too much ale, Rokr seduced another man's wife. That man called a holmgang against Rokr.

Id: [0x002D553D]
Rokr accepted the holmgang and on the agreed upon day, he laid out twelve of his axes, and asked, "Which of these will I use to slay you?"

Id: [0x002D553E]
"Will it be Bone-Splitter?" he said, "My bearded blade, inscribed with seidr runes, affixed to a handle of English oak?"

Id: [0x002D553F]
"Or Blood-Fountain," he continued, "My Dane axe, which swings through the air on two hands with the speed of an arrow's flight."

Id: [0x002D5540]
"Or might it be Twin-Wolf-Wounder," Rokr growled, growing ever more bold, "A fierce pair of throwing axes…"

Id: [0x002D5541]
At that moment, the man who had challenged Rokr brought a large stone down upon his head. Rokr died instantly, and his axes were given away as gifts.

Id: [0x002D5543]
There was a woman called Nal who came by ship to Fornberg unheralded, demanding to meet King Sigvaldi, Styrbjorn's father.

Id: [0x002D5544]
Nal was from Gautland. She was tall and rugged and strong, and everyone who walked near her said she smelled of men's blood.

Id: [0x002D5545]
When her message was sent to our king, Nal was made to wait a full day. Yet she did not complain. She watched the waves and sang songs.

Id: [0x002D5546]
Night came and went, and still Nal sat by the shore of the fjord, singing her songs. She skipped rocks with children and smiled.

Id: [0x002D5547]
As the afternoon of the second day approached, King Sigvaldi's messenger reappeared. They spoke quietly together.

Id: [0x002D5548]
At last the messenger stood back and waved to some men nearby. Three men bearing three chests of silver approached quickly.

Id: [0x002D5549]
They set the chests of silver in Nal's ship and stood back. Then Nal stepped forward, swinging a large bloodied sack before her.

Id: [0x002D554A]
Nal opened the sack and emptied it on the shore. Seven pairs of hands tumbled to the ground. Nal then mounted her ship and sailed away.

Id: [0x002D554C]
In my youth, I remember hearing the story of Kalda, a fierce young woman whose father forbade her from swordplay and raids.

Id: [0x002D554D]
Kalda had skills to match or surpass any man in the clan. And so it was that her beloved Gapi asked her aboard his ship.

Id: [0x002D554E]
Once again, Kalda's father forbade her to leave, calling her soft and weak and fragile. But Kalda ignored these insults and left.

Id: [0x002D554F]
For a full spring, Kalda and Gapi sailed the coast of Francia, raiding and plundering and taking much silver and riches.

Id: [0x002D5550]
Then, in the early weeks of summer, a passing ship gave Kalda the news that her mother had died suddenly. Kalda was grief stricken.

Id: [0x002D5551]
Kalda returned quickly home, only to find her mother there, alive and standing quietly beside her father. Kalda was confused.

Id: [0x002D5552]
Kalda's father spoke with a sour voice: "I sent the tale of your mother's death, for you were insolent. But now you are home, where you must stay."

Id: [0x002D5553]
Hearing these words, Kalda pulsed hot with rage. She slew her father and fled back to her ship, then set a swift sail for the horizon.

Id: [0x002D5556]
Stay still, stones! Or else the bad Pict-people will come for me…

Id: [0x002D5559]
I'll be okay on my own, Mama and Papa. Don't worry about me, I'll have an army of stone men to protect me!

Id: [0x002D555B]
But they keep falling…

Id: [0x002D555D]
Think of this as a test, of mind and wit. Stack the cairn stones high and wide.

Id: [0x002D555E]
Think of this as a test, of mind and wit. Stack the cairn stones high and wide.

Id: [0x002D555F]
Steady your hands and your heart, tiny-giant. Goodbye.

Id: [0x002D5560]
Steady your hands and your heart, tiny-giant. Goodbye.

Id: [0x002D5567]
By the gods! What manner of beast flung that poor creature up here to its doom?

Id: [0x002D5568]
By the gods! What manner of beast flung that poor creature up here to its doom?

Wulfhilda must know the truth of this.

Id: [0x002D556D]
Wulfhilda must know the truth of this.

Id: [0x002D5570]
You know … because he was dead. [beat]That was the end of Gilli's saga.

Id: [0x002D5571]
I hear your laughter. Yes, I saw Odin in a puddle of piss. Yet how many of you have seen the Hanged God, eh? That's right.

Id: [0x002D5573]
A long time ago, on youth's smooth path, I came into the company of an old skald. He wrote sagas for the jarls of the region.

Id: [0x002D5574]
He had fallen into trouble with some of the locals … and I could not stand by and watch him take a beating! So I stepped in.

Id: [0x002D5575]
Six men attacked me, and I was swiftly put down. For that, the old skald bought me ale and invited me to join him on his travels.

Id: [0x002D5577]
O yes! How their firm buttocks tighten as they bend to pick sweet flowers.

Id: [0x002D5578]
O, don't say you weren't thinking the same! One day, I will make that land my home. And those maidens will be mine!

Id: [0x002D5579]
I will paint it in your minds, my friends. How the wind stirs the trees, the birds cut the sky, and the lands are emerald green.

Id: [0x002D557E]
But these thoughts trouble me. For if the Nornir already know I am to be great, then I will be great, no matter what I do.

Id: [0x002D557F]
If I cast myself overboard to drown, would fate send a dolphin to save me? Or was I always meant for a watery end?

Id: [0x002D5580]
Should I do nothing at all? Why make an effort, when I could stand here and let my fate come to me?

Id: [0x002D5582]
I swore that in time I would return to avenge my father's death. But I waited too long.

Id: [0x002D5583]
Wiser men than me have been made fools by love, but not all of them take the lesson from it that I have.

Id: [0x002D5587]
You will be remembered.

Id: [0x002D5590]
This may be the work of a band of drunken Danes, or something far, far worse.

Id: [0x002D5591]
This may be the work of a band of drunken Danes, or something far, far worse.

Id: [0x002D5594]
Where are you hiding now?

Id: [0x002D5595]
Hey! I saw you, get back here!

Id: [0x002D5596]
Stop eating my garden, you filthy little things!

Id: [0x002D5597]
Like the trees of a great forest, they shade those beneath, and nothing more can grow there.

Id: [0x002D5598]
"Who's there?" he cried! But my girl was quick of wit, and knew her husband well.

Id: [0x002D559A]
So would you be if your every crop of turnips was demolished by a horde of mangy horrors!

Id: [0x002D559E]
You seem distressed.

Id: [0x002D559F]
You seem distressed.

Id: [0x002D55A5]
"Has Christ captured you?" Estrid asked me once, as we lay together in bed.

Id: [0x002D55B0]
Hark! Pict reinforcements!

Id: [0x002D55B1]
To battle! The spirits of my men are with me, and my spirit with theirs. Owooo![war cry]

Id: [0x002D55B2]
My men were not ready, and we were overwhelmed. But I'm afraid it's not over. They know I still live.

Id: [0x002D55B7]
What a fight! The Pict King Constantin will feel a little lighter in the purse tomorrow. Thank you for your aid, uh…?

Id: [0x002D55B9]
The name's Ryce, Ryce Sherwin. You know, we could use someone like you in our band of merry rogues and knaves.

Id: [0x002D55BA]
The poor get richer and the rich get poorer thanks to us. We've a hideout in the woods. Drop by sometime, share an ale maybe.

Id: [0x002D55BC]
The threat is gone.

Id: [0x002D55BD]
The threat is gone.

Id: [0x002D55BE]
Call me Eivor.

Id: [0x002D55BF]
Call me Eivor.

Id: [0x002D55C0]
Maybe.

Id: [0x002D55C1]
Maybe.

Id: [0x002D55C4]
Well, you are free to visit us again. Till we meet the next!

Id: [0x002D55C6]
I have been there.

Id: [0x002D55C7]
I have been there.

Id: [0x002D55C8]
Well, until we meet again!

Id: [0x002D55CA]
An Aesir? It is a dire day when even enemies must be friends. But I must beg for your help.

Id: [0x002D55CB]
A hunter lives in a house nearby. He has become crazed, and now he preys on his fellow Jotnar.

Id: [0x002D55CD]
So this fort is not the sum of his ambitions. Guthrum's plan is to bring the Saxons to the table?

Id: [0x002D55CE]
So this fort is not the sum of his ambitions. Guthrum's plan is to bring the Saxons to the table?

Id: [0x002D55D1]
He has captured and beat my love, and soon he means to skin him like a rabbit! Will you have mercy and aid us?

Id: [0x002D55D3]
Where is this hunter?

Id: [0x002D55D4]
Where is this hunter?

Id: [0x002D55D6]
Nor is Aelfred. If he has come, it is for his own advantage.

Id: [0x002D55DD]
When I catch you, I'll impale you! Maim you! Send you to bunny Hell!

Id: [0x002D55DF]
Aye, and he loved them nearly as much as I love my turnips. Look at him cry now. The sharpest pain is the sweetest ache.

Id: [0x002D55E1]
Those were your husband's rabbits?

Id: [0x002D55E2]
Those were your husband's rabbits?

Id: [0x002D55E8]
Go on! Nail those bobtailed little shits!

Id: [0x002D55E9]
Three less pesky vermin bastards in the world!

Id: [0x002D55EA]
Yes! That's what you get for eating my turnips, you bucktoothed fuckanapes!

Id: [0x002D55EB]
You got them! Every last one! Exterminated like the hairballs of Satan that they are!

Id: [0x002D5626]
O, I have no intention of cowing to that milk-sack. Now, more than ever, I will take his throne. And his head.

Id: [0x002D5627]
You swore upon the cross?

Id: [0x002D5628]
You swore upon the cross?

Id: [0x002D5646]
I must first hear a plan to balk at.

Id: [0x002D5647]
I must first hear a plan to balk at.

Id: [0x002D5665]
I will crush Aelfred's skull with my bare hands if Ubba is dead.

Id: [0x002D5667]
Or bloody wrath will steal it. I will follow this Aelfred, hound his heels. Revenge burns within me.

Id: [0x002D5669]
You turn my words against me now, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002D566B]
We cannot dwell on this, even if it is true. If you want the throne, only strategy will deliver it.

Why the wailing?

Why the wailing?

Id: [0x002D567D]
Music is the Devil's wind-breaking! Foul and rancid. I, as the Bishop of the Ruins, will not stand for it.

Id: [0x002D5683]
Smack my bishop!

Id: [0x002D5684]
Clout that cleric!

Id: [0x002D56C3]
You will die as my Cearo did!

Even sickened, I am more than your equal!

It won't be me that dies today!

Id: [0x002D56CB]
And Sigurd? He is back with you?

You almost sound like you respect him, Eivor.

My brother's story is a long one, and for another time.

And I am looking for a new adventure. If I remember right, you said I might find it here, with your clan.

Id: [0x002D5716]
I hope to. And I will start now.

Id: [0x002D5717]
Welcome, Bjorn. May you find a new home here among the Raven Clan.

The Order of the Ancients has some recent fascination with Vinland, but I cannot say what it might be.

Id: [0x002D571B]
That is an image I will fix in my mind, Wolf-Kissed. Happy to be aboard.

Id: [0x002D571C]
Eivor. Before you say more, I must tell you something. [pause]Randvi and I have … have ended our marriage.

Id: [0x002D571D]
Ah, do not be. We adore one another dearly, but our marriage was not built on love. We were brought together as an act of peace.

Id: [0x002D5724]
O I give up. I give up! [cough]You are the better fighter.[exert]

Id: [0x002D5725]
Sometimes I dream of soot-black furrowed earth. And blood seeping from seedlings, poisoning our future.

Id: [0x002D5727]
There you are, head to the fields, tot-tot. Fight your battle.

Id: [0x002D5728]
There you are, head to the fields, tot-tot. Fight your battle.

Id: [0x002D5729]
[exerts]I defend the cats. I love them.

Id: [0x002D572A]
Enough. I should not have attacked you. Just don't hurt my babies.

Id: [0x002D5751]
Loki. And, he was also a horse at the time.[beat] You didn't get mounted by a horse god, did you?

Id: [0x002D5752]
Loki. And, he was also a horse at the time.[beat] You didn't get mounted by a horse god, did you?

Id: [0x002D5755]
No! It was very much a man. A godly man, definitely not a mortal. But, I didn't see him by light of day so who knows.

Id: [0x002D5757]
O, gods. Where is that fucking spring?

Id: [0x002D5759]
This is impossible! Which way?

Id: [0x002D576A]
You oath-breakers! We had a truce.

Id: [0x002D576B]
And now it is ended. And you'll feel my axe in your gut, piglet.

Id: [0x002D5770]
Is that all it takes to become a witch?

Id: [0x002D5771]
Is that all it takes to become a witch?

Id: [0x002D5772]
Ha. Lying with woodland gods and living out in the wilderness, I should become a witch. What do you think, love?

Id: [0x002D5777]
For Ubba! Every great Norse you've sent to Valhalla, I'll send ten to your Hell.

Id: [0x002D5778]
You won't burn Werham, scum.

Id: [0x002D5782]
Lord Jesus Christ, help me stand against the filthy heathen threat.

Id: [0x002D5783]
Your God-son has forsaken you, Saxon.

Id: [0x002D5784]
You have no honor, Dane! You will not steal our land.

Id: [0x002D5785]
It is too late, little man. Our gods have spoken with war and wit. This is our England now.

Id: [0x002D5786]
My blood needs fire, after cooling in this sodden field.

Id: [0x002D5787]
You'll burn in Hell, traitorous scum!

Id: [0x002D5788]
I will feast on your marrow in Valhalla!

Id: [0x002D57A1]
Farewell!

Id: [0x002D57AC]
Dear Lord in Heaven. Give me strength!

Id: [0x002D57AD]
Ahh... I give up! It is just too far.

Id: [0x002D57D2]
Before?

Id: [0x002D57D4]
Before what, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D57D6]
Gods…

Look, boats there. We could sail the waters to Lincoln. Sink the ships of any enemies in our way!

Id: [0x002D5817]
That is for you to decide. The more alliances you have, the better your chances at victory.

Id: [0x002D5818]
I believe you do. Now is the time to strike. Before Fulke decides Sigurd is of no more use to her.

Id: [0x002D581C]

Ah! What is this? An entrance.

If you are a true drengr, a warrior with honor running like sunlight in your veins, then you may help me fulfill my destiny.

Id: [0x002D583A]
If you come looking for bears, there are none living here. Not now. But I have a better proposition than a rousing hunt.

Id: [0x002D583C]
The drengr's cave. If I go any further, I should be ready to engage in combat to the death.

For Ragnar, for glory, for the wandering drengir do I raise my blade.

Id: [0x002D5846]
You honor me with your skill and ferocity. That is all that matters.

Id: [0x002D584A]
Ermina! I've been looking everywhere. Bran told me you'd run off and I worried the worst.[seeing the baby] Is that? Is--

Id: [0x002D584E]
God-lover? Should I take that as a compliment of my prowess or an insult to my name?

Id: [0x002D584F]
This is your god-lover? I expected more.

Id: [0x002D5850]
This is your god-lover? I expected more.

Id: [0x002D5852]
I think I get a say in that! I care not about status, and if all we have together is some hut in the woods, then so be it!

Not a brawler remains who dares suffer these pains. You are the winner, the victor, you see, champion of the BBB[bee bee bee].

Id: [0x002D5875]
Are you ready?

Id: [0x002D5876]
He killed it with nothing but a knife. Leapt on its back, held tight, writhing like a fly on a dragon, he stayed put and it was done.

I was in Hedeby when I saw the truest scene of love. There were two royals, King Sigroth and Queen Alvidi, who seemed a matched pair.

Id: [0x002D58AA]
They ruled well. A dynasty of grace, honor, and might. They carried themselves with so much love, all of us envied them.

Id: [0x002D58AB]
Then Sigfrida arrived, princess and daughter to King Kjarvik. A rival house that had chosen to ally with Sigroth.

Id: [0x002D58AC]
But King Kjarvik refused to part with his daughter. An old man, his death was coming, and he commanded that she die with him.

Id: [0x002D58AD]
Sigfrida was next to be burned. As the flames took her, Sigroth leapt upon the pyre and followed her into the next place.

Id: [0x002D58AE]
Sigroth left behind a wife, children, a clan, a village, and all the riches and honor he held in. For love.

Id: [0x002D58AF]
What he did, it seems a dishonor. But love is often higher than honor![snort]

Id: [0x002D58B5]
I am. A Finnmark raider, and proud of it. [beat, struggling]For the little time I have left.

Id: [0x002D58B6]
It broke my axe and gouged me. I … I crawled up here to die.

Id: [0x002D58B7]
You are Hrothgar, leader of this war-band?

Id: [0x002D58B8]
You are Hrothgar, leader of this war-band?

That was a fluke, I bet it was.

Id: [0x002D58BB]
Yeh! I bet you can't hit that… uhhh… that chicken, right o'er there! The one hanging from the pole!

Id: [0x002D58C1]
Go on then, hit that hanging chicken from here. No cheatin'!

Id: [0x002D58C4]
Wha… thas mad!

Id: [0x002D58C8]
Extraordinary. That was true skill and aim.

Id: [0x002D58CD]
Hey, stop messin' around!

Id: [0x002D58CF]
That's it, they are fleeing!

Id: [0x002D58D0]
That's it, they are fleeing!

Drengr, I have returned.

Id: [0x002D58E7]
I am glad you have returned. A true drengr does not run. We continue the journey. But we must take the ritual formula.

Id: [0x002D58EA]
Now the All-Father sees me. He opens his arms, ready to receive!

Id: [0x002D58EC]
May you walk the Bifrost with heavy steps, drengr.

I do. I am Gotafrid Fairrobes, celebrated drengr of the Great Heathen Army. Trusted golden helm of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002D58FF]
You have returned. Would you care to fight?

Id: [0x002D5903]
I bid you farewell then. To a later moon. When the sky is crisp.

Hail, warrior. You keep this estate?

Id: [0x002D590B]
Ah, this old villa. Where the pristine drengr held court.

Id: [0x002D590C]
Ah, this old villa. Where the pristine drengr held court.

Id: [0x002D590F]
Immaculate strike. Such precision.

Id: [0x002D5916]
Good warrior, you carry yourself with the spirit of a drengr. I am a drengr too.

Id: [0x002D5917]
You have returned. To feed me to the plentiful waters, I hope.

Id: [0x002D5919]
Do you hear this, Son? Today you will see the color of the blood that made you! The color of courage and honor above all.

Id: [0x002D591B]
I will catch clams until then. And skirt destiny by fending off this nasty illness.

Id: [0x002D591C]
The air is filled with the smell of fish guts. Your catch appears generous. Your nets overflow with silver stock. You are lucky.

Your time of death is not now. Perhaps soon, by my axe or another.

Id: [0x002D5921]
Your time of death is not now. Perhaps soon, by my axe or another.

Id: [0x002D5925]
I am not normal. I am beyond anything that any man has ever witnessed. I am a wound that festers. A shit that stinks in the sun.

Id: [0x002D5926]
Now you see, Son, we are drengir!

Id: [0x002D5927]
Ah yes, the boil of battle! Its heat returns to me!

Id: [0x002D5928]
Watch me, Son! A true drengr can win a battle with a twig or a stone!

Id: [0x002D5929]
Son … do not look away! My end is near!

Id: [0x002D592A]
Ey! He's back! How was…?

Id: [0x002D592E]
Not good. [beat]Our friends will be remembered. But now, I need to plan for our next target. You lot can get back to training.

Id: [0x002D5932]
You have returned. To rid me of my ills, I hope.

Id: [0x002D5935]
Greetings. Is this battlefield yours?

Id: [0x002D5936]
Greetings. Is this battlefield yours?

Id: [0x002D5939]
Lost drengr. I will fight you. And help you find what Ragnar gave you.

Id: [0x002D593A]
Lost drengr. I will fight you. And help you find what Ragnar gave you.

Id: [0x002D593B]
You will have to endure your torments a little longer. I am sorry.

Id: [0x002D593C]
You will have to endure your torments a little longer. I am sorry.

Id: [0x002D593D]
Father I … I understand. I see the glory you spoke of. Go now to Valhalla, and join Ragnar in the war-eternal.

Id: [0x002D593F]
I recall this place. The drengr in despair lives here.

Id: [0x002D5940]
I recall this place. The drengr in despair lives here.

Id: [0x002D5941]
This one arm has learned the tricks of both! Beware!

Id: [0x002D5943]
Death to us both!

Id: [0x002D5945]
You have lanced me, Nokkfylla, the fetid boil. Let this death be the only good I have done since my master's death.

Id: [0x002D5948]
Remember your training and shoot for your life!

Id: [0x002D594B]
Owooo! [war cry]Greetings, friend! We're here to lend you our steel!

Id: [0x002D594D]
What is it that you do here?

Id: [0x002D594E]
What is it that you do here?

Id: [0x002D5951]
We borrow some coin from the ones who have plenty, and give it to the ones who need them.

Id: [0x002D5952]
We took silver from King Aella, jewels from Aethelwulf. I like to call it balancing the scale.

Id: [0x002D5955]
The only good heretic is a very dead heretic!

Id: [0x002D5956]
Smite the unbelievers! Smite them till they're smoten!

Id: [0x002D5957]
Salvation through pain! Come get some!

Id: [0x002D595A]
Odin's spear! Did your father mate with an ox?

Id: [0x002D595B]

Are you so keen to meet your god?

Id: [0x002D595D]

Id: [0x002D595F]
Is that the best your god can give? People will worship anyone these days.

Id: [0x002D5960]
Is that the best your god can give? People will worship anyone these days.

Id: [0x002D5962]
Faith! Faith…! You monster, how could you? She was so sweet, gentle, and delicate!

Id: [0x002D5963]
Great! Now I have to find someone else to tell me what to do.

Id: [0x002D5965]
His wife's grave. No wonder he visits this tree often.

Id: [0x002D5966]
His wife's grave. No wonder he visits this tree often.

Id: [0x002D598F]
Hah! This one takes us for a fool, Brother. We Sons of Ragnar have this well under control.

Id: [0x002D599C]
I intend a clean and honorable battle as my days grow old and rotten. I wish to keep myself dignified in my death-rattle.

Id: [0x002D59A3]
My war garments are unblemished. Well-groomed and pristine. Ragnar taught me self-respect when we summered here.

Id: [0x002D59A7]
A resonant thought. Now will you oblige me? An honorable and clean battle is all I ask for now.

Id: [0x002D59AA]
Your upkeep is impressive.

Id: [0x002D59AB]
Your upkeep is impressive.

Id: [0x002D59AE]
A clean conscience, unblemished oaths, and immaculate loyalty are of higher value than any well-dusted piece of armor.

Id: [0x002D59B5]
My weapons are dulled and impure. I shall only use the sharp and aseptic. Only the purest.

Id: [0x002D59B8]
Grief sick or no, the world is better without him in it.

Id: [0x002D59B9]

Id: [0x002D59C0]
We all remember when Eivor gave orders to attack Kjotve's clan in Avaldsnes. I knew even then, our chance at victory was slim.

Id: [0x002D59C1]
It was a fool's errand. But Eivor demanded we strike, and I am not one to disobey my superior. Such is the mark of an honorable man.

Id: [0x002D59C2]
You all know what followed. We set upon Kjotve's men and were overwhelmed. You lot were captured and fit to be butchered.

Id: [0x002D59C3]
And Eivor here, carried off to be sold into slavery, a fate worse than a fine death. But there is one fact you do not know!

Id: [0x002D59C4]
In the initial fight, I came upon Kjotve, cowering in an empty house. He did not see me, and I came within two arms lengths of him.

Id: [0x002D59C5]
I could have slain him! A fast stroke of my axe, ending our troubles. But I held back! Why? Because I remembered my oath to Eivor!

Id: [0x002D59C6]
Yes, years ago, Eivor had staked a claim on Kjotve's life. So I left the bacraut (asshole) alone. Yes.

Id: [0x002D59CB]
A pity, Dag. There is no one living who can verify this incredible tale.

Id: [0x002D59CC]
A pity, Dag. There is no one living who can verify this incredible tale.

Id: [0x002D59CE]
Hommm…

Id: [0x002D59D1]
We have lost many fire-bloods. This land has sapped our strength. There will be too few of us to settle when we are done.

Id: [0x002D59D3]
So long as I do not lose your friendship, your oath will be fulfilled.

Id: [0x002D59D4]
So long as I do not lose your friendship, your oath will be fulfilled.

Id: [0x002D59D6]
You may not know this, but Ragnar Lothbrok once asked me to lead his early assault on England myself.

Id: [0x002D59D7]
This would have been eight, maybe ten years back. It is hard to say. The winters blow into one another like a great white fog.

Id: [0x002D59D8]
But I remember, as if it were yesterday. Ragnar appeared at my home, unannounced. Naturally, I welcomed him.

Id: [0x002D59D9]
He had traveled a great distance, only to see me. So I poured him ale and fed him bread and listened as he talked.

Id: [0x002D59DA]
He was feeling anxious about his journey. Leading so many men into such a great war, it was a burden he could not handle.

Id: [0x002D59DB]
It was then, with tears wetting his lids, that he said, "Dag, teach me the art of war. Lead us to England and to victory!"

Id: [0x002D59DC]
But I shook my head. "Ragnar," I told him "I have two weddings I must attend soon. Were it not for these, surely I would help you."

Id: [0x002D59DD]
Ragnar bowed his head. "Thank you, Dag," he said. "Though you will not be on my ship, you will be present in spirit. And that is enough."

Id: [0x002D59DE]
This is a drengr's ritual chamber. I am Skegjold, pledged to Ragnar Lothbrok in hugr and body. Iron and soul.

Id: [0x002D59E0]
I seek one willing to take the ritual and engage me in combat to the death.

Id: [0x002D59EB]
For Odin, for Thor, for Freyja and the Valkyries, and the Saggy-Britches. Come to me, Ragnar. Find me in the Frenzy.

Id: [0x002D59F0]
You might not be aware, but I am a man with considerable shipbuilding craft.

Id: [0x002D59F1]
In my youth, just thirteen winters old, I designed an improvement to our dragon-Boats. One that gave them extra strength.

Id: [0x002D59F2]
It is so common now that none remember my genius design. But at the time, I was praised from the top to the bottom of Norway.

Id: [0x002D59F3]
I had been out sailing with my father, when we hit a rough patch of ocean. Our boat trembled like a frozen skeleton.

Id: [0x002D59F4]
We nearly broke to pieces, but I was not afraid. I was transfixed by the ship itself, watching it bulge and heave.

Id: [0x002D59F5]
As men screamed around me, I devised improvements to keep the hull solid and shapely.

Id: [0x002D59F6]
When we returned to port, the men vomiting and weeping around me, I shared my ideas with my jarl. He thanked me well.

Id: [0x002D59F7]
In time, all our ships used my new design. And soon all of Norway. So you may thank me, not the gods, for our smooth passage here.

Id: [0x002D59F8]
Norway belongs to the Norse!

Id: [0x002D59FD]
You are a true drengr. Ragnar would have liked you!

Id: [0x002D59FF]
A fitting end to honorable warring. Now I go to see my brother, he who laughed at death, scourge of all England, Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002D5A02]
Farewell, drengr. Listen for hoof-beats, and follow the Valkyries home.

Id: [0x002D5A03]
Farewell, drengr. Listen for hoof-beats, and follow the Valkyries home.

Id: [0x002D5A07]
Or Death found them.

Id: [0x002D5A08]
Or Death found them.

Id: [0x002D5A0A]
Join me then, in Drengr-Seidr. Ragnar taught it to me at Upsalla for nine moons and I never stopped.

Id: [0x002D5A0C]
A sacred ale of high volatile spirits. And Thor's Fungus, the Amanita Muscaria.

Id: [0x002D5A0E]
Ragnar and I would quaff this great elixir before each new raid. I often saw him transcend the laws of battle.

Id: [0x002D5A11]
What is the potion then? Mead and rotten bread?

Id: [0x002D5A12]
What is the potion then? Mead and rotten bread?

Id: [0x002D5A18]
My weapons are polished and prepared, if you wish to dance.

Id: [0x002D5A19]
Though I hope you have bathed recently.

Id: [0x002D5AAB]
As soon as I regain my strength, we will go. I fear I am too weak to move.

Id: [0x002D5AAD]
How will I ever get this done?

Id: [0x002D5AAF]
If only Rose were here. She would help me.

Id: [0x002D5AB1]
I'm too old! Much too heavy.

Id: [0x002D5ABC]
I've been longing to speak to you again.

Id: [0x002D5ABE]
You are a little confused.

Id: [0x002D5ABF]
You are a little confused.

Id: [0x002D5AC0]
I have never spoken to you before.

Id: [0x002D5AC1]
I have never spoken to you before.

Id: [0x002D5AC6]
I am one with the earth! With the air and water, and fire, and … What is the other? Clouds! Tree bark. What is that smell? These breeches are too big. Elderberries!

Id: [0x002D5AC7]
Stay put, you fool! You must let the effects wear off.

Id: [0x002D5ACB]
I feel sick in my body, but it is my hugr (mind) that will prevail!

Id: [0x002D5ACE]
I have the strength of one thousand Thors! I cannot be stopped!

Id: [0x002D5AD1]
This victory I will add to my growing saga!

Id: [0x002D5AD4]
Aye, them! They're nowt but rats with ears stuck on! I'd slay 'em if I could, but they're too damned fast.

Id: [0x002D5AD6]
I assume you mean the rabbits in that field?

Id: [0x002D5AD7]
I assume you mean the rabbits in that field?

Id: [0x002D5AD9]
Soma of Grantebridge. For a time, all the ealdormen of England wanted her dead. A bounty on her head the size of Yggdrasil.

Id: [0x002D5ADC]
So she met with the leader of the South Gyrwans and told their King Roffe, "Say that you killed me. Proclaim it to all of the lands."

Id: [0x002D5ADD]
Roffe answered, "No one will believe me." And Soma shook her head. "Invite them. Here. You will burn me on a pyre for all to see."

Id: [0x002D5ADE]
So they came, the nobles of East Anglia, north and south, of Mercia, of Wessex. They wished to see Guthrum's Valkyrie die.

Id: [0x002D5ADF]
Before all, King Roffe pronounced her guilty of murder and sentenced her to death. Then they put her on a boat and set it afire.

Id: [0x002D5AE1]
Yet Soma had constructed a trap beneath the pyre. She released herself into the murky waters and swam to a bramble.

Id: [0x002D5AE2]
Muddied and wet, she waited in the thorns for night to fall. She then returned to Cambridge as a shadow-walker.

Id: [0x002D5AE3]
She entered the city and stole into the king's chamber, and took the head of Roffe, shouting, "Traitors of Soma wear no heads!"

Id: [0x002D5AE6]
The Saxons thought Soma a ghost! A spirit who kills! A curse invincible to fire and death! What a leader, my Soma.

Id: [0x002D5AEB]
I'm going to have to drag you back myself, eh?

Id: [0x002D5AEC]
I'm going to have to drag you back myself, eh?

Id: [0x002D5AF1]
If I don't stop him, something or someone less forgiving will. I should stay close by, wait for him to tire.

Id: [0x002D5AF2]
If I don't stop him, something or someone less forgiving will. I should stay close by, wait for him to tire.

Id: [0x002D5AF6]
My mother taught me to care for oaths as if they were my own heart. There is no greater aim than to honor an oath 'til death.

Id: [0x002D5AF7]
I like to take oaths in the ancient manner: do not eat for a day, then cut a sheet of peaty turf from the earth.

Id: [0x002D5AFA]
"Now, with nothing to your name, with nothing to gain or lose, will you pledge your heart, your family, your raven-wine…

Id: [0x002D5AFB]
And finally, the dagger. Together, draw blood from the cradle of the sword-earth. Mixed your inner-rivers. And you are bound.

Id: [0x002D5AFC]
That is how you make an oath. Today we shake, spit, and trade arm rings. All ceremony is gone. All thunder and spirit.

Id: [0x002D5AFF]
A good shag story should liven our spirits!

Id: [0x002D5B00]
Now all your shag stories are surely dumb and swift. [snort]I joke, you are surely the greatest lovers, every one of you.

Id: [0x002D5B01]
However, my stories of shagging are greater than most sagas.

Id: [0x002D5B03]
Eivor, you must not go. You must not! The signs, the portents, they shout and wail! Your leaving will be our doom!

Id: [0x002D5B04]
I have thrown the bones, I have stirred the offal of beasts, and in the rising steam, I saw the end of all.

Id: [0x002D5B06]
I thank you for this, Valka. But the yarns of fate are too frayed for me to follow now.

Id: [0x002D5B07]
I thank you for this, Valka. But the yarns of fate are too frayed for me to follow now.

Id: [0x002D5B08]
So he gave us his blessing. We ran for the stables, stole a horse, and never looked back.

Id: [0x002D5B0B]
Some time ago, I met a wandering skald in search of a jarl or king to serve.

Id: [0x002D5B0C]
He had not composed a verse in years and was fearful of losing his skill. I said I knew many such great men.

Id: [0x002D5B0D]
A few jarls, a handful of kings by name. But to my knowledge all of them had many skalds of their own.

Id: [0x002D5B0E]
This poor skald was disappointed and thanked me for my time, asking my name as he departed. "Dag Nithisson," I told him.

Id: [0x002D5B0F]
The skald's eyes went wide. "Dag Nithisson!" he exclaimed. "Of Fornberg?" I nodded and said, "The very man, I am."

Id: [0x002D5B10]
The poor skald sung to the skies with joy. "You are a legend among legends," he said. "Let me compose a verse for you, if I may."

Id: [0x002D5B11]
Imagine my surprise at hearing such praise, but I agreed. So he began, for two days, composing a most lovely verse on my behalf.

Id: [0x002D5B12]
Yes, a most lovely verse. Unforgettable, yes. And I will … yes, I will recite it for you, one day … when we have time.

Id: [0x002D5B16]
The last time we were docked, I saw two drunk-as-Odin warriors take a tinkle off this great river-steed.

Id: [0x002D5B17]
Such a dishonor to so loyal a steed! Do you realize how many trees had to die for us to use them as our vessel?

Id: [0x002D5B18]
A longship is a hundred horses that mated with sacred fish! Gudrun and Gudmund are like the bloody elves of Asgard!

Id: [0x002D5B19]
You dare desecrate this scourge of the swan-roads? This fire-spouter to the boughs of England?

Id: [0x002D5B1A]
You should lick these benches! Caress the masthead, thank the sails, make offerings to the hull. This is our home-upon-the-waves!

Id: [0x002D5B1B]
Hail to our river king, wave-walker, and loyal serpent. I think I have said enough. Let it never happen again!

Id: [0x002D5B1E]
He left then and never returned. Olaf's story died in those bland cups of mead.

Id: [0x002D5B24]
A powerful union. With everything to gain, all to lose, Sigroth and Sigfrida disobeyed all logic and fell deeply in love.

Id: [0x002D5B25]
She would join him in the corpse hall before joining Sigroth in marriage. So it would pass. Kjarvik died.

Id: [0x002D5B27]
Foul magic gathers here.

Id: [0x002D5B2E]
Sigurd…

Id: [0x002D5B2F]
Sigurd…

Id: [0x002D5B30]
I am sorry to hear that.

Id: [0x002D5B31]
I am sorry to hear that.

Id: [0x002D5B34]
Then I'm glad for you both. And for the rest of us. This place would not be the same without you two.

Id: [0x002D5B35]
Then I'm glad for you both. And for the rest of us. This place would not be the same without you two.

Id: [0x002D5B39]
In that way, your honor burns bright. It does not dwindle, as you speak the old words…

Id: [0x002D5B3A]
…Your honor, your might, and your word to each and each who stands and stood with you like fire in fire?"

Id: [0x002D5B3C]
O, you have likely never heard the story of the time Odin and Freyja appeared before me on a dark winter's night! They call--

Id: [0x002D5B3D]
They called you their orphaned child, yes, Dag. We have heard the tale as often as the sun has risen and set.

Id: [0x002D5B3F]
Did I ever tell you all the story of how I killed an entire clan single-handedly with the broken hilt of a sword?

Id: [0x002D5B40]
Too often, Dag. More times than any man can count.

Id: [0x002D5B42]
Here is a tale I do not often tell! There was a clan, little known in the south, composed entirely of warrior women! And I wh--

Id: [0x002D5B43]
Why you did not stay with them when they asked you to be their king, Dag, I will never understand.

Id: [0x002D5B45]
Have you heard me tell the tale of the six Christian missionaries I lured away from their faith, into the worship of almighty Thor?

Id: [0x002D5B46]
You showed them how to turn their crosses into hammers, simply by flipping them over. And they fainted with joy. That tale?

Id: [0x002D5B47]
Ah, yes. Yes, indeed.

Id: [0x002D5B4A]
Here is a story I have not told a man, for it happened only last month! I was sharing a mead horn with a beautiful woman, when--

Id: [0x002D5B4B]
She, her sisters, and her mother, all begged for your hand in marriage. Is that how this tale ends?

Id: [0x002D5B4C]
Ah … yes. Were you … were you there?

Id: [0x002D5B4D]
Trolls fear me. I am mind-fucked. Once a drengr, now a draugr. A walking dead. Rotten within and without. Fuck.

Id: [0x002D5B54]
Not long before leaving for England, I made a solitary trek into the mountains east of Fornberg.

Id: [0x002D5B55]
I was looking for elk, or deer, or other game to bring home. But my luck was poor, and I could find nothing worth my arrows.

Id: [0x002D5B56]
Coming up over a rise, I saw a rounded mountain ahead of me, with a strange narrow slit in the earth running left to right.

Id: [0x002D5B57]
There appeared to be fresh water in this crevasse, which was strange, for it was on its side.

Id: [0x002D5B58]
As I approached, the ground rumbled and the crevasse shuddered. Then it opened, as wide as a lake, and ringed with color.

Id: [0x002D5B59]
Stepping back to take in the view, I realized with a shock what I was seeing. The eye of Jormungandr, the world serpent!

Id: [0x002D5B5A]
Yes! He sleeps near old Fornberg, blessing us with his dreams. O, if we could return there now I would show you the place.

Id: [0x002D5B5B]
One day, maybe. One day I will show you the place.

Id: [0x002D5B60]
And then?

Id: [0x002D5B61]
And then?

Id: [0x002D5B64]
Sleep well, old friend.

Id: [0x002D5B65]
Sleep well, old friend.

Id: [0x002D5B66]
When I was a girl, I tied threads to my mother's cats and screamed, "The Kottgatt rides through Valhalla!"

Id: [0x002D5B67]
Why is it when we grow old, we stop telling ourselves the most fantastic stories?

Id: [0x002D5B68]
Why is it we stop believing we can command the gods?

Id: [0x002D5B69]
We abandon all the true dramas of our own creations, our own friendly seidr, for the dark seidr. The political seidr.

Id: [0x002D5B6A]
When we are children, we are the nobles of our little world. The Rulers of Moments. The Glory of Glee.

Id: [0x002D5B6B]
And if I have learned anything from all of my battles, all of my wars, my days, my regrets, my victories…

Id: [0x002D5B6C]
I always take the time to have fun. I do not apologize for it. So save your stupidest war cry for me, Birna, Lover of Strangeness!

Id: [0x002D5B6F]
I must know what happened.

Id: [0x002D5B70]
I must know what happened.

Id: [0x002D5B75]
What does she want with him?

Id: [0x002D5B7C]
Sigurd has been taken hostage. Captured by King Aelfred and given to a woman named Fulke. A very dangerous woman.

Id: [0x002D5B7D]
Sigurd has been taken hostage. Captured by King Aelfred and given to a woman named Fulke. A very dangerous woman.

Id: [0x002D5B7E]
I will spare you Fulke's ramblings, but know this … Sigurd did his part to secure an alliance with a thegn called Geadric.

Id: [0x002D5B7F]
I will spare you Fulke's ramblings, but know this … Sigurd did his part to secure an alliance with a thegn called Geadric.

Id: [0x002D5B80]
Geadric is an honest man and will come when I call. Until that time, Basim will locate Fulke. Look for his message when it comes.

Id: [0x002D5B81]
Geadric is an honest man and will come when I call. Until that time, Basim will locate Fulke. Look for his message when it comes.

Id: [0x002D5B84]
I feared as much when this letter arrived. From one called Fulke, addressed to you.

Id: [0x002D5B87]
It is there on the table…

Id: [0x002D5B89]
From Fulke? Gods, that witch.

Id: [0x002D5B8A]
From Fulke? Gods, that witch.

Id: [0x002D5B8B]
I once shagged in battle, inside a monastery with a kindred warrior. We finished on the alter, forgetting all gods and all spirits.

Id: [0x002D5B8C]
You rise higher than spirits when you plow with hugr and abandon.

Id: [0x002D5B8D]
I once shagged in the crook of a tree's branches, like the legs of a Jotun wrapped around us. We finished and fell to earth.

Id: [0x002D5B8E]
A good shag is a great escape. That is my meaning in this story. If you find another, that is yours to keep.

Id: [0x002D5B90]
Okay, back to these swan-roads…

Id: [0x002D5B92]
Eivor, what has happened?

Id: [0x002D5B93]
Fulke is with The Order of the Ancients. The same Order Kjotve followed. The Order that Basim and Hytham have pledged to destroy.

Id: [0x002D5B94]
Fulke is with The Order of the Ancients. The same Order Kjotve followed. The Order that Basim and Hytham have pledged to destroy.

Id: [0x002D5B98]
What? O, yes. What was I saying? Ah, your mother and I in the storeroom. Yes. Well.

Id: [0x002D5B99]
Yes? O. "The cows are spent!" Your mother bade me not to be a ninny. She led me in a circle back to the buckets in the shade.

Id: [0x002D5B9E]
You're not a priest, are you?

Id: [0x002D5B9F]
You're not a priest, are you?

Id: [0x002D5BA4]
Huh! A lot of good bringing us here did!

Id: [0x002D5BA5]
It's obvious this piddling stream is useless. I'm stuck, blind as a dead dog, with no one to guide me on my way.

Id: [0x002D5BA8]
I have no one to help me get around. Woe, O woe. Sometimes I almost lose faith.

Id: [0x002D5BA9]
Wait.

Id: [0x002D5BB0]
Asgard belongs to the Aesir!

Id: [0x002D5BB2]
We are proud to serve you, Havi!

Id: [0x002D5BB4]
Sigurd…

Id: [0x002D5BB5]
Sigurd…

Id: [0x002D5BB7]
The Nornir work a tangled weave.

Id: [0x002D5BB8]
The Nornir work a tangled weave.

Id: [0x002D5BB9]
What?

Id: [0x002D5BBA]
I need someone to lead, and you can see!

Id: [0x002D5BBB]
And I need someone to carry me!

Id: [0x002D5BBC]
Together, we are as one full man!

Id: [0x002D5BBF]
My mind is fixed on Suthsexe. Basim and I have a chance to save Sigurd. But we will need an army.

Id: [0x002D5BC0]
My mind is fixed on Suthsexe. Basim and I have a chance to save Sigurd. But we will need an army.

Id: [0x002D5BC1]
We are undefeated!

Id: [0x002D5BC2]
Asgard will never fall!

Id: [0x002D5BC3]
Your fame will live eternal!

Id: [0x002D5BC4]
You fight with great passion, Stikla.

Id: [0x002D5BC5]
You fight with great passion, Stikla.

Id: [0x002D5BC8]
You are difficult to sate! I like it.

Id: [0x002D5BC9]
You are difficult to sate! I like it.

Id: [0x002D5BDF]
This is the gutter of an unchained drengr. A lost drengr. That is what I am. I am vile. I should not be allowed to suck on clean air.

Id: [0x002D5BE1]
Many of them were. Many were not. Their blood is now mingled and it stinks of the iron of my blades. What an end.

Id: [0x002D5BE2]
Beloved Ragnar Lothbrok, he always kept me in check. He steadied the ship of my hugr. Without him, I have lost my bearings.

Id: [0x002D5BE3]
I scare myself. Not a thread of decency remains. The drengr I was, I have lost him. Would you end this suffering? For me?

Id: [0x002D5BE7]
Yes. You know my pain. And you look as though you could end it. Do this, then, a final kindness for an unworthy wretch.

Id: [0x002D5BE8]
A drengr kills honorably, with glory and pride. Were these men not innocent?

Id: [0x002D5BE9]
A drengr kills honorably, with glory and pride. Were these men not innocent?

Id: [0x002D5BEA]
You live with a great pain. One that cannot be eased by a wergild (penance), nor a reckoning.

Id: [0x002D5BEB]
You live with a great pain. One that cannot be eased by a wergild (penance), nor a reckoning.

Id: [0x002D5BEC]
Loki's children, take me one and all.[scream]

Id: [0x002D5BF3]
We're stopping…

Id: [0x002D5BF4]
We're stopping…

Id: [0x002D5BF6]
Now I transcend. Farewell. It is my turn to see the god of poetry.

Id: [0x002D5BFF]
I will only fight one who enters my frenzy, for if we are not in the same state, I will have an unfair advantage.

Id: [0x002D5C02]
Drink of the brew that bubbles here in my pot. Then we will enter the frenzy together, and only one of us will leave.

Id: [0x002D5C32]
My pie is near, my nose does not lie! Come out, thief!

Id: [0x002D5C35]
Come out, come out!

Id: [0x002D5C38]
I am impervious to all but the iron of a true drengr. Ragnar Lothbrok knew this, and bade me carry only boards. As a challenge.

Id: [0x002D5C39]
Now he is gone, and I remain. I wish to die, but I cannot. For he made me too strong. Now I spend my time longing for his company.

Id: [0x002D5C3B]
None that I am aware of. I was always the center of Ragnar's shield wall. He trusted me with the defenses of his great army.

Id: [0x002D5C3D]
My flesh, scarred and trained by Ragnar, is now like an iron weave. It pains me. How can I join him if none can kill me in battle?

Id: [0x002D5C3E]
I see no way in which this can occur. Unless, you prove me wrong, fair challenger.

Id: [0x002D5C40]
I see no way forward. I cannot be defeated. Unless you can prove me wrong, fair challenger.

Id: [0x002D5C42]
You must have a weak point.

Id: [0x002D5C43]
You must have a weak point.

Id: [0x002D5C48]
I am Orwig Neverdeath. I wish to die.

Id: [0x002D5C4B]
This drengr territory. One of Ragnar Lothbrok's wandering warriors lurks here.

Id: [0x002D5C4C]
This drengr territory. One of Ragnar Lothbrok's wandering warriors lurks here.

Id: [0x002D5C4E]
Stand fast, warrior. And if Loki rules the day, you may have a chance.

Id: [0x002D5C52]
I … I never thought I would feel this! Vulnerable. Death, lurking near!

Id: [0x002D5C57]
I … I have been breached. Victory is yours. Victory is mine…

Id: [0x002D5C5A]
See if you can hit one of the targets above.

Id: [0x002D5C5B]
That was sound aim! Amazing!

Id: [0x002D5C64]
A small gesture for their cause.

Id: [0x002D5C65]
A small gesture for their cause.

Id: [0x002D5C6C]
It's just been a while since anyone passed this way, and I wanted to be sure you would stay and visit.

Id: [0x002D5C6E]
My mother used to tell me stories, legends of a forgotten king. Of magic swords rising from misty lake waters.

Id: [0x002D5C6F]
So much more romantic than a pathetic man whiling away the hours until death.

Id: [0x002D5C75]
O, no. There's also spite and malice.

Id: [0x002D5C76]
Is cruelty the only coin in your marriage?

Id: [0x002D5C77]
Is cruelty the only coin in your marriage?

Id: [0x002D5C79]
Have I ever told you the story about--

Id: [0x002D5C7C]
I am fairly certain you have. Anyone else with a tale to share before Dag starts talking again?

Id: [0x002D5C7D]
I am fairly certain you have. Anyone else with a tale to share before Dag starts talking again?

Id: [0x002D5C80]
And I will be beside you for them all, my axe ready and my heart stout!

Id: [0x002D5C81]
Let their delight be ours then. We have many battles to wage before the end.

Id: [0x002D5C82]
Let their delight be ours then. We have many battles to wage before the end.

Id: [0x002D5C84]
What other amusement do I have in this grim and cheerless life? I am wed to a sour-faced shrew, her misery my only joy.

Id: [0x002D5C85]
Look at her scowling now! Face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle! See what I must wake up to each morn?

Id: [0x002D5C86]
And the chance to torment your wife was not at all in your thoughts, I suppose?

Id: [0x002D5C87]
And the chance to torment your wife was not at all in your thoughts, I suppose?

Id: [0x002D5C88]
Leave me now. Let the hag delight in my tears. I don't care anymore.

Id: [0x002D5C8B]
Apologies will be cold comfort to Flopsy in his barrow tonight. But it is not you I blame. Gerhild is the villain here, as always.

Id: [0x002D5C8C]
My apologies. I did not know they were yours.

Id: [0x002D5C8D]
My apologies. I did not know they were yours.

Id: [0x002D5C8E]
By God, you're as vile as she is!

Id: [0x002D5C90]
These two are a match in misery. I should leave them be. They deserve each other.

Id: [0x002D5C91]
These two are a match in misery. I should leave them be. They deserve each other.

If Guthrum has given you his word, then he will honor it. We will leave this town.

Id: [0x002D5C94]
If Guthrum has given you his word, then he will honor it. We will leave this town.

Id: [0x002D5C99]
The nets are well set. You have stocks for a hundred moons. You will live a long and hearty life.

Id: [0x002D5C9A]
But Father, you are not too ill to stay!

Id: [0x002D5C9B]
But I am. The weavers have sent me many portents. I only await a proper death, 'til the family axe of honor passes to you.

Id: [0x002D5CA3]
My life has had many chapters. Ragnar Lothbrok himself started as a farmer, you know. He often envied my choice.

Id: [0x002D5CA6]
I did. And it was here in England that I saw a land so fertile you could spit and food would grow. Waters teeming with fish.

Id: [0x002D5CA7]
In fish monger's slacks? Is this your way of hiding? Or protecting those around you?

Id: [0x002D5CA8]
In fish monger's slacks? Is this your way of hiding? Or protecting those around you?

Id: [0x002D5CAB]
I met a Saxon lady, Aethelswig, and we have made a fine life for ourselves. The best clams in all of East Anglia.

Id: [0x002D5CAC]
But now I must show my son the way of the drengr. How to die with honor.

Id: [0x002D5CAE]
I want my son to watch. He should have the final word when I pass. He will not see me die on a bed coughing like a crow.

Id: [0x002D5CB0]
I respect your desire for an honorable death.

Id: [0x002D5CB1]
I respect your desire for an honorable death.

Id: [0x002D5CB4]
Any weapon will do!

Id: [0x002D5CB8]
I have reached the glory-gate. Think of me, my boy. My dear love. Now you know.

Id: [0x002D5CB9]
Your father is a fine warrior. A drengr to the end.

Id: [0x002D5CBA]
Your father is a fine warrior. A drengr to the end.

Sigurd…

Id: [0x002D5CE3]
Sigurd…

Id: [0x002D5CFD]
I see.[sigh] I suppose you want to see the wallop?

Id: [0x002D5CFE]
This is a sad moment in time. Hold on to your teeth.

Id: [0x002D5D01]
Hej. I have returned.

Id: [0x002D5D02]
Hej. I have returned.

Id: [0x002D5D03]
Still unbeaten. Why, God? Come back if you want another taste of my endless victory. I know I don't want you to.

Id: [0x002D5D06]
I must pass for now. But your time will come, fair drengr. And I may be there to aid you.

Id: [0x002D5D07]
I must pass for now. But your time will come, fair drengr. And I may be there to aid you.

Id: [0x002D5D09]
I hope you will. Let me now prepare the shield wall. Lord Ragnar, will this be the day?

Id: [0x002D5D0A]
Let me do the honor of breaking Ragnar's shield wall.

Id: [0x002D5D0B]
Let me do the honor of breaking Ragnar's shield wall.

Id: [0x002D5D0C]
My unbreakable shell awaits the impossible. Be on your way.

Id: [0x002D5D10]
I am a fortress impenetrable. This is my skill. This is my curse.

Id: [0x002D5D12]
For the less your enemy thinks of you, and the more he thinks you a fool, the more likely he is to make a grave error.

Id: [0x002D5D13]
We are here to stay, are we not? Heed my advice and you will live a long, long time.

Id: [0x002D5D14]
You want a story, but I will give you a confession. And if you think me weaker for it, that tells more about you than me.

Id: [0x002D5D15]
Here is my secret. I love love.

Id: [0x002D5D16]
My mother once said, better to feel the stings and arrows of love than nothing at all. Be a bolt of lightning, not a stone.

Id: [0x002D5D18]
Yes! Break me, drengr!

Id: [0x002D5D1A]
We built families, overthrew kingdoms, sailed mountains, fought for whole seasons, and now … now he is gone.

Id: [0x002D5D1C]
Together we celebrated the kill, as if we had felled the beast together. That is when I knew I would live and die for this man.

Id: [0x002D5D1D]
All of Norway laments the passing of King Ragnar. I cannot imagine the sorrow his warriors now feel.

Id: [0x002D5D1E]
All of Norway laments the passing of King Ragnar. I cannot imagine the sorrow his warriors now feel.

Id: [0x002D5D20]
Very well. For Ragnar Lothbrok, the true King of Norway.

I must wait for the ideal time to fight such a warrior of your class, drengr. Have patience.

When a foul king strolls into town, an oath means as much as dust. These flimsy oaths, they cost us everything.

Id: [0x002D5D26]
Then wrap your sword in this oily carpet of dirt and grass, flakes from great Ymir's old corpse. And set it aflame.

Id: [0x002D5D28]
Vili, what tales are you weaving for these soft-downed Saxons? Do not make me regret supporting your jarldom.

"Then Freyja rode her cats through Aelfheim, tearing up the Dark Elves, in search of the Mead of Poetry!"

Id: [0x002D5D63]
You know who you are, both of you. No need to raise your hand. But did you know, I saw your waters stain the sides of this ship!

Id: [0x002D5D64]
I am sorry, Son, for our wretched, stank-infested house!

Id: [0x002D5D65]
I can still smell it! O, I can taste it! Ah! Gah! The war is over, this must change…[gag]

Id: [0x002D5D68]
Friend, I've lost my key.

Id: [0x002D5D6A]
I haven't the strength to break open my door.

Id: [0x002D5D9F]
Maybe you need more fire, like your first time.

Id: [0x002D5DA0]
Maybe you need more fire, like your first time.

Id: [0x002D5DA7]
Hej, Bron.

Id: [0x002D5DA8]
Hej, Bron.

Id: [0x002D5DAC]
I wish I could laugh but … I cannot. Yes! That rank odor is from the Devil! The Devil who produced me with his prick! O, that smell!

Id: [0x002D5DAE]
He dips his arrows in cow dung and never washes[gag] … says it brings him luck. We're doomed to choke in Father's shit-house!

Id: [0x002D5DB1]
Be careful in there, stranger! The smell could kill you!

Id: [0x002D5DB2]
I will wait.

Id: [0x002D5DB6]
You are back! Good! The boy must see my end! Return and fight!

Id: [0x002D5DB7]
This is where the old drengr dwelled. The fish monger with his son.

My battle-irons are in prime condition.

Id: [0x002D5DC6]
Ah, my wounds bleed clean! Thank you for this last song of well-wrought iron and immaculate blows.

Id: [0x002D5DCE]
I understand. For an opponent you could do worse than me.

Id: [0x002D5DCF]
I understand. For an opponent you could do worse than me.

Id: [0x002D5DD3]
This is for the lady of many names!

Id: [0x002D5DD6]
Drink from the brew you see in my pot, and our frenzied battle will begin.

Id: [0x002D5DDE]
Yes! Once free of those disgusting dung-crates, the house will be clean again.

Id: [0x002D5DE1]
A vikingr must have his axe to gain entrance to Valhalla. Home of our gods and eternal glory. It is a warrior's final home.

These berries are the only thing keeping me alive in the face of such a vile smell.

Id: [0x002D5DE7]
O, the guard captain's. And the alewife, Lugg. And Ysane's muse. But, who am I to deny women my company?

Id: [0x002D5DE8]
Gar! Odin! Trolls! Bra!

Id: [0x002D5DEA]
Odin welcomes all kinds, so long as they war louder and drink faster than the last man.

Id: [0x002D5DEB]

Id: [0x002D5DEC]
Wonderful, the house is habitable again!

Id: [0x002D5DEE]
My father. Degolas. He's a famous archer, but he never washes. Never. I'm going to confront him. That pox.

Id: [0x002D5DF1]
The stink from those crates is gone, but in my experience, if you do not cure the source, shit returns.

Mother, I'm going to get Father back. I've had enough, change is in the air. Literally!

Id: [0x002D5DF5]
I will, one day, get down, but my heroic odor will persist! It is what gives me my special powers! God told me.

Id: [0x002D5DF8]
It was in this cavern that I knew my life was tied to Ragnar's. We were young, hunting a bear, when we chanced upon this spot.

Id: [0x002D5DFA]
You carry no blade, only shields?

Id: [0x002D5DFB]
You carry no blade, only shields?

Id: [0x002D5DFD]
Stand fast and tall, he who cannot die. The gates open for you.

And how likely is that?

Id: [0x002D5E07]
And how likely is that?

Id: [0x002D5E0B]
We can rest here a moment.

Id: [0x002D5E0E]
I will.

Id: [0x002D5E0F]
I hid it somewhere long ago. Forgive me, I can't recall just where. Help me search.

Id: [0x002D5E16]
Let me have a look.

Id: [0x002D5E18]
That's no horn.

Id: [0x002D5E19]
That's no horn.

Id: [0x002D5E1A]
Hold!

Id: [0x002D5E1E]
Eivor, you know I will take your childhood scrapes and secrets to the pyre.

Id: [0x002D5E23]
Good … I would hate for something to happen to you in the coming fight.

Vili, leave these poor boys alone. Their ears are too delicate for the filth you pour in.

Vili, leave these poor boys alone. Their ears are too delicate for the filth you pour in.

Id: [0x002D5E2F]
I am all aquiver with anticipation.

Id: [0x002D5E30]
And you taught me a lot, Eivor. Our time together was … well, it taught me much.

Id: [0x002D5E31]
In fact, I composed a poem for the occasion. Would you like to hear it?

Id: [0x002D5E37]
You have changed much from that God-whipped boy. That is good to see.

Id: [0x002D5E38]

Later, Tewdwr. I have many allies to greet before the battle. Stay safe and well, until then.

You have no understanding of duty, the loyalty I freely give. His plan for England, for the world, is worth the cost of my life.

Id: [0x002D5E51]
Then sing your tuneless hymns.

Then sing your tuneless hymns.

This island will never be your home, Eivor. You will not subdue her with vicious force, or win her with cocksure words.

Id: [0x002D5E69]
We Saxons will always stand firm. Shoulder-by-shoulder against thieves and tyrants, whose envious eyes fall upon England.

Id: [0x002D5EC2]
There was nothing more you could have done. Friendship has a hollow ring if there is no threat of losing it.

Id: [0x002D5EC8]
I will find a way in.

Id: [0x002D5EC9]
I will find a way in.

Id: [0x002D5ECC]
And we shall do that, Christians and pagans, side-by-side. Never persecuted.

Id: [0x002D5ECD]
Even though your god-son preaches peace?

Id: [0x002D5ECE]
Even though your god-son preaches peace?

Id: [0x002D5ED0]
I should find my other allies.

Keep him in your thoughts. For when a man is mourned, his deeds cheered and his songs sung, he cannot die.

Id: [0x002D5ED4]
You have given me more than I would ever have asked for. How will I repay it?

Id: [0x002D5ED5]

Good work, Guthrum. I hope the rest have fared as well.

That is most of them. Make sure the garrison stays under our control. I need to help the others.

Id: [0x002D5EDC]
You will regret this unholy interruption!

Id: [0x002D5EE1]
Protect the thegns at all costs!

Id: [0x002D5EE2]
You attack us on our holy feast day?

Id: [0x002D5EE3]
Cippenhamm will not fall to you scum.

Id: [0x002D5EE5]
Go, Eivor. They will not better us.

Id: [0x002D5EE7]
Hold these men back, I'll find them.

Id: [0x002D5EF0]
We stumble through our years, ravenous, grasping. Spilling blood, stealing gold, and it is never enough.

Id: [0x002D5EF1]
Would it not soothe you to know there is something beyond all this? Not war and valor, but quiet and peace?

Id: [0x002D5EF3]
Aelfred made me swear fealty upon the cross of their god's son. He held such faith in it … a plain, unadorned thing.

Id: [0x002D5EF4]
It burned between my fingers, as if I had pulled it from the fire. A feeling strange and powerful, but gone in an instant.

Id: [0x002D5EF5]
All I wish for now, is to live among the friends I have made. That is what counts.

Id: [0x002D5EF6]

Id: [0x002D5EF8]
I have not felt its like before.

Id: [0x002D5EFB]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x002D5EFC]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x002D5EFE]
Whatever, I must do. England is my final home, Eivor. And I will do what it takes to remain.

Id: [0x002D5F01]
You cannot win England with your sorry crew of deluded farmers and godless fools.

Id: [0x002D5F02]
Eivor … have you seen graver wounds?

Id: [0x002D5F04]
Hunwald … come, get up. This is no time for weep-wailing.

Id: [0x002D5F05]
Hunwald … come, get up. This is no time for weep-wailing.

Id: [0x002D5F06]
I am Vili, if you would know who cleaves your skull!

Id: [0x002D5F07]
Drink and revel while you can. I'll break your Saxon noggins.

Id: [0x002D5F08]
You fucking Wesexians will not move on Mercia.

Id: [0x002D5F09]
These Danes defy our God and king!

Id: [0x002D5F0A]
Stand true, God protects us on his day of feasts!

Id: [0x002D5F0B]
You will not rout us, interlopers. Not on this Christ mass.

Id: [0x002D5F0C]
Do not waste your efforts here. Go help the others!

Id: [0x002D5F10]
Remember, you can only shoot a target once! Ready? Go!

Id: [0x002D5F11]
Huh! Not bad.

Id: [0x002D5F14]
Ha! Bull's-eye. I dare you to do better.

Id: [0x002D5F15]
Yes! Take that!

Id: [0x002D5F16]
If this was a deer, we would be feasting well tonight.

Id: [0x002D5F18]
Good game.

Id: [0x002D5F19]
Ha! Petra wins! Sorry, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D5F1A]
Right in the middle!

Id: [0x002D5F1B]
Right in the middle!

Id: [0x002D5F1C]
See that one, Petra?

Id: [0x002D5F1D]
See that one, Petra?

Id: [0x002D5F1E]
And I believe the victory goes to me.

Id: [0x002D5F1F]

Knowledge, Sea King, and the pursuit of it. Untangling mysteries, uncovering lore … that is what feeds me.

Id: [0x002D5F24]
My home at Noatun will bring me pleasure enough. But what about you, Wily One? What do you love?

Id: [0x002D5F26]
I hope you find peace, noble Njord. A bad match can be troublesome, but not worse than having nothing to love.

Id: [0x002D5F27]

So, what is the plan, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D5F32]
Soma? … Dead?

Id: [0x002D5F35]
Guthrum Jarl, we are not without losses. Some of them grave.

I should check on Guthrum at the feast hall.

You fools are making this worse!

Id: [0x002D5F48]
Good, come find us again when you are ready.

Id: [0x002D5F4A]
We await your instructions, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D5F4D]
Good. If we capture the thegns, they will be no danger when I confront Aelfred.

Id: [0x002D5F66]
Leave me be! I am no threat to you.

Hurry! These waves of reinforcements are Hel-sent.

Id: [0x002D5F6B]
Broder! What can I do?

Id: [0x002D5F6C]
Broder! What can I do?

Id: [0x002D5F6D]
I will find a way to open the gates from the inside.

Id: [0x002D5F6F]
No, no … you were my staunch protector, Eluric.

Id: [0x002D5F72]
I … I may be all right. There is so little pain just now…

Id: [0x002D5F73]
Please, Eivor. We must get him to the farmhouse.

Id: [0x002D5F74]
I will get you to safety, Hunwald. Stay calm.

Id: [0x002D5F75]
I will get you to safety, Hunwald. Stay calm.

Id: [0x002D5F79]
I feel liberated of my legacy. Now I can live the normal life that has forever eluded me. Thank the heavens!

Id: [0x002D5F7C]
I'm so cold. Has winter come so soon?

Id: [0x002D5F80]
I am glad to have known you, Eivor. My truest…

Id: [0x002D5F82]
You will warm yourself with mead and dancing yet, my friend.

Id: [0x002D5F83]
You will warm yourself with mead and dancing yet, my friend.

Id: [0x002D5F87]
I will not leave his side, Eivor. I owe him that at least.

Id: [0x002D5F8E]
For Eivor and the Raven Clan!

Id: [0x002D5F92]
This feast will end in blood.

Id: [0x002D5F93]
Fall on your knees and pray to your god-son.

Id: [0x002D5F96]
The last of the Saxons are fleeing. The battle is won!

Many times we have seen him feeding the wild beasts and speaking with them. Even the wolves do not savage him.

The name's Otta Sluggasson. I usually try to dodge Danes like yourself, but you seem friendly.

Id: [0x002D5FA7]
Mm, nothing more sweet than the crack of a good clean rock-hit. Like a warrior's axe cutting through a shield wall!

Id: [0x002D5FA9]
All right. Here's a taste of my fire. Get ready, kids.

Id: [0x002D5FAC]
I would like to see this "rock-hit" you speak of.

Id: [0x002D5FB4]
Blood brings blood. More will come. Things worse now. Eawynn and I better go somewhere else.

I'm impressed, Otta Sluggasson.

I would not want these kids to lose a hero by besting you.

Id: [0x002D5FC3]

Id: [0x002D5FC5]
I like this Viking. Kids, gather round! [turns to Eivor]Are you sure you want to challenge me?

Id: [0x002D5FD7]
Are you ready to honor them?

Id: [0x002D5FDA]
Many fought for us and died. They deserve peace.

Yes, there is nothing more to say.

Id: [0x002D5FE2]
If you were indeed deceived, Dane, you'll return my bibelot and help me kill this villain.

Id: [0x002D5FE3]
No!

Id: [0x002D5FE6]
I should like to hear what music you write. Will you perform it somewhere?

Id: [0x002D5FE7]
I should like to hear what music you write. Will you perform it somewhere?

Id: [0x002D5FE8]
If I can get Cynewulf's bastardly face to help me with this meter. But you will have my thanks in this performance regardless.

Id: [0x002D5FE9]
One day, I will honor him. And make of myself a drengr.

I regret only that I did not hear the battle-song of Ragnar's horn.

If this is one of them, my worries have vanished.

Ah! You never said this one was a poet!

Take in the sights of Repton if you like. We will be at the docks when you're ready to go.

Id: [0x002D6048]
Eivor, tell the captain we're ready to march. Ivarr and I will round up the men. Do you know your way around a battering ram?

Id: [0x002D6049]
Burgred wanted a fight. Now we'll give him one. Are you ready to march now?

Id: [0x002D604A]
My son told me what happened earlier, with Ivarr pressuring him to fight. He said you intervened.

Mmm, ripe as a plum, aren't you? So eager…

Tonna! We have an intruder!

Bring a friend, Brother. Maybe Eivor dares to be called that.

I feared you were one of them.

Id: [0x002D6050]
Keep your hands off me, pagan!

Id: [0x002D6051]
Stay away from me!

Id: [0x002D6052]
Do you understand what you're doing, pagan? I am the Lady of Mercia!

Id: [0x002D6053]
There! I want that Dane cleaved and butchered!

Id: [0x002D6054]
Not yet. Fight me, heathen!

Id: [0x002D6055]
Be ready for my call, Eivor. It will come!

Id: [0x002D6056]
You soften with age, Wolf-Kissed. And now you have your own tales to tell. Put your skalds to work.

Id: [0x002D6057]
Very kind of you, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D6058]
You're a long way from Norway, Wolf-Kissed! Vili will be pleased to know it.

Id: [0x002D6059]
Shred my sheepskin. That there is Eivor the Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D605A]
Freyja's kiss, you came. Welcome.

Id: [0x002D605B]
And yet my old heart sings great songs at the sight of you. You look good, Eivor. Strong. Healthy.

Id: [0x002D605C]
Yours is a poet's heart, I am told. What a mix of spirits you have.

Id: [0x002D605D]
Let's hope you fight better than you age, old friend.

Id: [0x002D605E]
No no, stop stop. I am fine. There is more blood here than injury.

Id: [0x002D605F]
I thought you would come faster if it was Vili's name you heard first. I need your wisdom, Eivor. Your discretion.

Id: [0x002D6060]
Are you sure you want my father's mead? Not afraid you might wake up tomorrow, naked, face down in a hog's pen?

Id: [0x002D6061]
No, I am certain I saved you from a snowdrift once. And a murderous tree. That's how I remember it.

Id: [0x002D6062]
Thank you, warrior. Thank you.

Id: [0x002D6063]
You've become a great warrior, Eivor. A warrior and a leader, worth song and verse.

Id: [0x002D6064]
Fret not, friend. I have a nose for these things. Seek out the exile. He'll see to your shield.

Id: [0x002D6066]
Flee, warrior, flee! Loki's horde lays waste here!

Id: [0x002D6067]
Does the world need such useless, dithering men? Why not stake a claim yourself? Take this shire for your own.

Id: [0x002D6068]
You know best, drengr. Just … take care, will you?

Id: [0x002D6069]
We need to fall back. Follow me. Quickly!

Id: [0x002D606A]
My child … my dear child. I only did what I thought was best. You must know that.

Id: [0x002D606B]
Ever reckless, ever foolish, you could have been the one to guide my son to a better and wiser course.

Id: [0x002D606C]
I do not think you will, Eivor. I think you will marvel at what I have to show you.

Id: [0x002D606D]
Of course not. You are as stalwart as a pillar of stone.

Id: [0x002D606E]
To Valhalla. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002D606F]
Hail, drengr! Welcome!

Id: [0x002D6070]
Don't be a coward, Eivor! Come fight me!

Id: [0x002D6071]
Eivor, join me when you have tired of crushing mice!

Id: [0x002D6072]
Swine!

Id: [0x002D6073]
My Eivor! There you are! What a warrior you have made of yourself. I am overfilled with pride!

Id: [0x002D6074]
You stood tall where your brother stumbled, yet you still came to his aid.

Id: [0x002D6075]
Yet I cleared your path. I guided your axe!

Id: [0x002D6076]
Do not diminish yourself!

Id: [0x002D6077]
You are mine! Do not turn away!

Id: [0x002D6078]
Coward of cowards!

Id: [0x002D6079]
Beggar's bastard!

Id: [0x002D607A]
Stand and face me, you feeble-armed thrall!

Id: [0x002D607B]
This is not a decision I make lightly, Eivor. You are family. You were my drengr.

Id: [0x002D607C]
Since my captivity, I felt you were cold and distant. But here your words glow with heart-fire and kindness.

Id: [0x002D607D]
Hello, little one! Ready to celebrate this great day?

Id: [0x002D607E]
Ah, there you are, my little drengr.

Id: [0x002D607F]
Yes. Now … now for our little plan. When you see us talking, be quiet as a wood mouse and then surprise him with our gift.

Id: [0x002D6080]
You are just like your father, little berserker! Skal to you!

Id: [0x002D6081]
You see? She agrees!

Id: [0x002D6082]
[laugh]O, look at you, blood-soaked drengr. Have you been warring without me?

Id: [0x002D6083]
How? You've been trapped here for a millennium. Eivor put you here.

Id: [0x002D6084]
This Dane is deluded! How dare you speak to my husband in this manner.

Id: [0x002D6085]
Eivor, my friend.

Id: [0x002D6086]
Have you come to a decision? To whom have you given the silver?

Id: [0x002D6087]
Have you made progress, my friend?

Id: [0x002D6088]
Friend or foe?

Id: [0x002D6089]
There's my liberator! I'll do you proud, I will.

Id: [0x002D608A]
Well done, Eivor. An eel!

Id: [0x002D608C]
Yes, it is time. I want to experience this wallop.

Id: [0x002D608D]
Yes, it is time. I want to experience this wallop.

Id: [0x002D6092]
Well, you've chosen your friends poorly, though that's to be expected of a lowborn Dane.

Id: [0x002D6093]
Turn around, Dane. Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.

Id: [0x002D6094]
Such humility. Where is the Eivor I once knew?

Id: [0x002D6095]
Vili and the Wolf-Kissed fight by our sides again!

Id: [0x002D6096]
You are a leader of Einherjar!

Id: [0x002D6097]
Where you go, Eivor, I will follow. Our clan is yours to lead.

Id: [0x002D6098]
You have a stormy look.

Id: [0x002D6099]
Are we in league, Dane? To buy me a throne? What say you?

Id: [0x002D609A]
What is it, Dane?

Id: [0x002D609B]
I cannot be purchased with looted silver, Dane. Stand away.

Id: [0x002D609C]
You! Dane! Get me out of this cursed chicken coop!

Id: [0x002D609D]
I been waiting to get back at these Britons ever since you broke me from that cage, Dane. The time is nigh.

Id: [0x002D609E]
Are we your friends, Dane?

Id: [0x002D609F]
What you say is good sense. Very well, Dane. Here's what I know.

Id: [0x002D60A0]
Both of us fretting over our war-hungry companions, it seems we are of the same mind.

Id: [0x002D60A2]
There is nothing tasty about a brooch.

Id: [0x002D60A4]
One of you swallowed it! Who was it?

Id: [0x002D60A8]
Stand clear! I will catch it!

Id: [0x002D60A9]
Stand clear! I will catch it!

Id: [0x002D60AA]
Halt, you well-weaned wolf!

Id: [0x002D60AB]
Halt, you well-weaned wolf!

Id: [0x002D60AD]
(sigh)

Id: [0x002D60AE]
(sigh)

Id: [0x002D60B0]
Well … do not share that with them.

Id: [0x002D60B6]
Time to send our friends to their great reward. Will you do the honors?

Id: [0x002D60BB]
Nothing awaits them. They lived, they died. Now their bodies will burn to cinders. Their saga ends here.

Id: [0x002D60BC]
Nothing awaits them. They lived, they died. Now their bodies will burn to cinders. Their saga ends here.

Id: [0x002D60BD]
O! Is it that Hun I asked for?

Id: [0x002D60C0]
Begone, Dane. Your name is not yet known to us.

Id: [0x002D60C1]
You are the Wolf-Kissed one, the Raven of Battle whose fame grows with each waxing of the moon.

Id: [0x002D60C2]
What are you doing? Take up your axe! Wield like a true warrior!

Id: [0x002D60C3]
You struck Basim, you lashed out at me, you made a fool of us all. That is not a leader I wish to follow into death and glory.

Id: [0x002D60C5]
I've had no luck getting your brooch.

Id: [0x002D60C6]
I have had no luck getting your brooch.

Id: [0x002D60C8]
You'll frighten the sheep!

Id: [0x002D60C9]
You said it yourself, his betrayal is worth a thousand deaths. I'm just waiting on a ship to take me to Rome.

Id: [0x002D60CA]
Come now. You are too clever to run with those Ragnarsson dogs. Plenty of room on this side, if you want to earn some coin.

Id: [0x002D60CB]
I am not the man I was. My time as the jarl of our clan has run short. You must lead us now.

Id: [0x002D60CC]
Eivor, well met! You received my message, and just in time. Our negotiations with the Britons have not yet begun.

Id: [0x002D60CE]
In a manner of speaking. I awoke in a cave beside a dead man clutching some treasure.

Id: [0x002D60CF]
In a manner of speaking. I awoke in a cave beside a dead man clutching some treasure.

Id: [0x002D60D0]
Our fates are weaved together, lovely dove!

Id: [0x002D60D1]
And who are you, lovely dove? Want to perch your ass on my lap?

Id: [0x002D60D2]
Watch yourself, lovely dove.

Id: [0x002D60D3]
Bad idea, lovely dove. Now I'm going to make you regret it.

Id: [0x002D60D4]
You crossed me, lovely dove. Did you think I wouldn't find out?

Id: [0x002D60D5]
Dearest skald of war and verse, how do you like this frenzy so far?

Id: [0x002D60D6]
I do not know you well, but Ceolbert believes you a steady head. We need such a one.

Id: [0x002D60D9]
Dear Lord, what a sound!

Id: [0x002D60DC]
The Gleemen we were called, the finest bards in all Lunden. Our music moved statues to tears.

Id: [0x002D60DE]
I see. And whose wife did you bed?

Id: [0x002D60DF]
I see. And whose wife did you bed?

Id: [0x002D60E1]
That may be so! But, this scoundrel will play naught but the sweetest music for his freedom. You understand?

Id: [0x002D60E2]
A scoundrel and a poor friend.

Id: [0x002D60E3]
A scoundrel and a poor friend.

Id: [0x002D60E6]
But … a simple boat will do.

Id: [0x002D60E8]
Hmm … I've not heard that outcome before.

Id: [0x002D60EB]
I'll never get out! What if the witch comes back!

Id: [0x002D60EC]
You stumbled out of here, then began sprinting across this forest as if you had a nose for something. Very feral.

Id: [0x002D60ED]
I was worried, but I'm glad to see you are all right. Your wealth has swelled, has it not?

Id: [0x002D60EF]
Good thinking.

Id: [0x002D60F0]
Good thinking.

Id: [0x002D60F1]
Kind of you. I've been … somewhat lost, truth be told. With Ceolbert … gone, the world seems to have … lost a shade of color.

Id: [0x002D60F2]
Eivor! Wolf-Kissed. You have come at just the right time. Ubba and Ivarr here are hunting a king.

Id: [0x002D60F4]
Eivor … is your axe sharpened?

Id: [0x002D60F5]
And you are Eivor, the one who helped the Danes in Grantebridgescire. Destroyed poor Wigmund.

Id: [0x002D60F6]
And who might you be?

Id: [0x002D60F7]
I want you at the helm of ours. You're strong and agile.

Id: [0x002D60F9]
Find anything yet?

Id: [0x002D60FA]
See if you can get anything more out of them. Me and Eivor will take care of fetching Aethelswith.

Id: [0x002D60FB]
Y-you think you've … won? You haven't! Leofrith … I sent him away with orders to destroy you.

Id: [0x002D60FC]
The mess you're in … you don't know the half of it.

Id: [0x002D60FD]
Eivor … you have shown me a great kindness. It … it is only fitting that I do the same.

Id: [0x002D60FE]
Back there, with Leofrith … why did you see it fit to kill him?

Id: [0x002D60FF]
Take this, Wolf-Kissed. As a sign of friendship. And should you call, the Brothers Ragnarsson will come.

Id: [0x002D6100]
Wolf-Kissed! Vili Jarl's off at Kinder Downfall, fishing rope in tow.

Id: [0x002D6101]
Pour the mead! Eivor's come to Snotingham!

Id: [0x002D6102]
Trygve spoke true. You have come to England.

Id: [0x002D6103]
My clan fought well, did they not? You saw it, the heart in these people. How they rallied behind their jarl.

Id: [0x002D6104]
Your sight is clear and your mind is sharp. Let that guide your thinking in the days to come.

Id: [0x002D6105]
Eivor, you found my secret haunt.

Id: [0x002D6106]
You dared Surtr's Heat! Yes! A most potent drink, distilled from grain by the Rus of Kiev. Dip your horn and have a drink.

Id: [0x002D6107]
As Sigurd was your chief. But that did not quench your appetite for glory, as you took his place upon the high seat of your clan.

Id: [0x002D6108]
You saw it coming, and you welcomed it.

Id: [0x002D6109]
As Sigurd is your chief! But that does not quench your appetite for glory, as you covet his place upon the high seat of your clan.

Id: [0x002D610A]
This is not how I remember you.

Id: [0x002D610B]
You have seen what was needed?

Id: [0x002D610C]
Did you consult the volva?

Id: [0x002D610D]
[sigh]Were you glad to hear from me?

Id: [0x002D610E]
Let it be known the Hemmings and Clan Raven are true-sworn friends from this day forward. Do you accept?

Id: [0x002D610F]
You know how to ruin a good moment, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D6110]
Time will tell. And one day, sooner or in the far future, I may return to England to witness what you have made.

Id: [0x002D6111]
I see. Thank you for telling me.

Id: [0x002D6112]
Have you? And what did they foretell?

Id: [0x002D6114]
This shrine is ours. It will open for us. Watch and see for yourself.

Id: [0x002D6115]
Come on, Wolf-Kissed! Let me cut you a new scar!

Id: [0x002D6116]
Have you lost all your love for life?

Id: [0x002D6117]
You wished to see your father. I made it happen. As easy as breathing.

Id: [0x002D6118]
Why leave this place? A glory you fought so hard to find?

Id: [0x002D6119]
You are the Wolf-Kissed one, who lingered at the edge of death, yet fought back.

Id: [0x002D611A]
You spilled the raven-wine of battle to paint whole kingdoms red.

Id: [0x002D611B]
You have killed kings and crowned them as you desired, bowing to none.

Id: [0x002D611C]
You have earned your place here, Eivor. Seize it!

Id: [0x002D611D]
I have given you everything you wanted. Everything you needed!

Id: [0x002D611E]
Everything you believe in stirs before you! Yet you question all! You question the very gods!

Id: [0x002D611F]
I want you to suffer!

Id: [0x002D6120]
When Dag called you out, as he felt he must … you refused him honor, did you not?

Id: [0x002D6121]
A cowardly act, one I abhor. Dag acted out of love for this clan. That is not worth the shame you inflicted on his name.

Id: [0x002D6122]
And when I returned to the settlement, your pattern of disobedience continued. I made a judgment … and you openly defied me!

Id: [0x002D6123]
And my grievances go back further still. You stole my father's riches. In my haste to leave, I should have stopped you then…

Id: [0x002D6124]
A true leader would have stopped that thought before it took form. You were selfish.

Id: [0x002D6125]
You never told me this. And has your prophecy come to pass?

Id: [0x002D6126]
Randvi told me of your bravery, your courage, your wisdom. In my absence, you were a pillar of stone. She admires you.

Id: [0x002D6127]
When Dag called you out and challenged you to a duel, you let him die with honor … in spite of his betrayal.

Id: [0x002D6128]
I recall our days in Oxenefordscire, our search for the Saga Stone. You disagreed with my orders. But you followed them.

Id: [0x002D6129]
You questioned my methods, my aims … but you did not disobey.

Id: [0x002D612A]
And when I passed judgment on Holger, you let my sentence lie, though I knew you disagreed. The look on your face said all.

Id: [0x002D612B]
And I remember and admire the way you guided us from Norway to England. You kept my anger in check, my ambitions focused.

Id: [0x002D612C]
In all my days away, in my fog of confusion, you have shown great wisdom and strength and leadership.

Id: [0x002D612D]
Did you find the … the ring?

Id: [0x002D612E]
So, did you see our king?

Id: [0x002D612F]
[ONOs when seeing Eivor and tickling her]

Id: [0x002D6130]
It's not in Eivor's DNA is it?

Id: [0x002D6131]
Eivor carved these runes.

Id: [0x002D6132]
Good question. Eivor seems to be doing fine, but I'll pay more attention.

Id: [0x002D6133]
The temple Eivor found … that's where the field originates.

Id: [0x002D6134]
This is … this is Eivor's Valhalla. Or-or, a simulation of it.

Id: [0x002D6135]
Basim … you sent the message. You led us to Eivor's grave.

Id: [0x002D6136]
Have you made a decision at last? Ivarr is increasingly agitated.

Id: [0x002D6137]
Eivor, at the outset of our conflict, you gave me a boon of silver to ease our way to peace.

Id: [0x002D6138]
Ah! Ah! You might have burned my branch and berries off!

Id: [0x002D6139]
Eivor opened the bleedin' gate!

Id: [0x002D613A]
How do you come to know this?

Id: [0x002D613B]
An end you did not deny him.

Id: [0x002D613C]
God go with you, Eivor. Wherever you may lead.

Id: [0x002D618F]
But the pleasure was not worth the pain. And now … I have her … whole … whole cursed clan to deal with.

Id: [0x002D6191]
Only if it will … blunt her tongue.

Id: [0x002D6192]
I know a rune that will dull the edges of their weapons.

Id: [0x002D6193]
I know a rune that will dull the edges of their weapons.

Id: [0x002D6196]
Oh, really!

Id: [0x002D6197]
I relish the challenge.

Id: [0x002D6198]
Oh! Oh, I see how it is! Ha!

Id: [0x002D619A]
Let's do this.

Id: [0x002D619B]
Your bravery is admirable.

Id: [0x002D619C]
Let's get started.

Id: [0x002D619E]
Pity! Can your pride handle a rematch?

Id: [0x002D619F]
That's that done. Want to try again or are you afraid?

Id: [0x002D61A1]
Hmm...

Id: [0x002D61A2]
Which ones...

Id: [0x002D61A3]
Let's see...

Id: [0x002D61A5]
That was unexpected.

Id: [0x002D61A6]
Do you know how rare that is?

Id: [0x002D61A7]
This is quite the game.

Id: [0x002D61A9]
I won't lie: I'm impressed.

Id: [0x002D61AA]
Give it to me, I can take it.

Id: [0x002D61AB]
Oh, I face a true warrior.

Id: [0x002D61AD]
You really shut me up! Care to play again?

Id: [0x002D61AE]
You got very lucky! Want to try that luck again?

Id: [0x002D61B0]
You're going down!

Id: [0x002D61B1]
It's all over for you.

Id: [0x002D61B2]
The end is nigh.

Id: [0x002D61B8]
Almost got you!

Id: [0x002D61B9]
Got lucky there!

Id: [0x002D61BA]
Ooh, you're a tricky one!

Id: [0x002D61BC]
All right, let's have at it.

Id: [0x002D61BD]
Let's get on it.

Id: [0x002D61C5]
Fair, fair.

Id: [0x002D61C6]
All right, fine.

Id: [0x002D61C8]
Well, here we go...

Id: [0x002D61C9]
I don't like what's happening here...

Id: [0x002D61CA]
This bodes...poorly.

Id: [0x002D61CC]
Your luck will turn. Come, try again!

Id: [0x002D61CD]
And that's how it's done.

Id: [0x002D61CF]
Admirable, you did well. Rematch?

Id: [0x002D61D0]
All right. Before you celebrate too much, shall we play again?

Id: [0x002D61D6]
Gaze upon me, the goddess of good fortune.

Id: [0x002D61D7]
You like that?

Id: [0x002D61D8]
Mmm, how does defeat taste?

Id: [0x002D61DA]
Feisty, I love it!

Id: [0x002D61DB]
You don't go down without a fight!

Id: [0x002D61DC]
Now we're really getting into it.

Id: [0x002D61DE]
Oh, well played! Well played!

Id: [0x002D61DF]
Ooh! Got me.

Id: [0x002D61E0]
Ha! Have mercy on old Tarben!

Id: [0x002D61E2]
Ha. No sore losers here. Want to play again?

Id: [0x002D61E3]
You did well! But can you do it again?

Id: [0x002D61E5]
Thought I had you!

Id: [0x002D61E6]
Ha! Curses, that was close.

Id: [0x002D61E7]
Ha, that would have been good for me.

Id: [0x002D61E9]
Your luck will turn. Come, try again!

Id: [0x002D61EA]
Ah, what a shame.

Id: [0x002D61EC]
Feeling lucky today, stranger?

Id: [0x002D61ED]
I'll take you on.

Id: [0x002D61EE]
Challenge accepted.

Id: [0x002D61F0]
Why? Scared? Ha!

Id: [0x002D61F1]
I accept your non-acceptance.

Id: [0x002D61F3]
Don't love that...

Id: [0x002D61F4]
Impressive!

Id: [0x002D61F5]
Lucky, lucky.

Id: [0x002D61F7]
Haha!

Id: [0x002D61F8]
I like the look of this...

Id: [0x002D61F9]
Ha! Yes!

Id: [0x002D61FB]
Brilliant! Really good stuff, Eivor. Fancy a rematch?

Id: [0x002D61FC]
Goodness what a loss. Could I request a rematch?

Id: [0x002D6202]
Beauty. Let's kick this off.

Id: [0x002D6203]
Another round? I'm game.

Id: [0x002D6205]
That was fun! Shall I defeat you again?

Id: [0x002D6206]
A grievous loss. I hope you can recover somehow. Perhaps with another game?

Id: [0x002D620C]
Ooh, there's strength in you yet!

Id: [0x002D620D]
You're such a survivor... I love it.

Id: [0x002D620E]
Staying in the game!

Id: [0x002D6210]
Hmm...

Id: [0x002D6211]
Which shall I choose...

Id: [0x002D6212]
Not sure...

Id: [0x002D621A]
I've got you now!

Id: [0x002D621B]
Oh, it isn't looking good for you, is it?

Id: [0x002D621C]
Got you now, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D621E]
Ha, this does not bode well...

Id: [0x002D621F]
Should I beg for mercy, love?

Id: [0x002D6220]
You've got something brewing, haven't you?

Id: [0x002D6222]
Oh! Remarkable.

Id: [0x002D6223]
How unlikely!

Id: [0x002D6224]
Huh. What are the odds?

Id: [0x002D6231]
Victory! As expected!

Id: [0x002D6232]
No hard feelings, I hope. 'Fraid you never stood a chance.

Id: [0x002D6234]
Keep at it!

Id: [0x002D6235]
Too much for you?

Id: [0x002D6236]
Come on! You can do better!

Id: [0x002D6237]
Getting ahead of you, now!

Id: [0x002D6238]
I thought you said you were good at this?

Id: [0x002D623A]
Never seen anything like it. You're a wonder!

Id: [0x002D623B]
You drink like a fish! Stunning!

Id: [0x002D624A]
Good, good! Let's drink.

Id: [0x002D624B]
Roll out the barrels.

Id: [0x002D625F]
God, you're special. I love it.

Id: [0x002D6260]
You did so well. I'm-- I think I'm proud of you!

Id: [0x002D6265]
And that is how it's done! Ask for lessons any time.

Id: [0x002D6266]
Still the best.

Id: [0x002D6271]
You call that drinking?

Id: [0x002D6272]
Is this your first time trying ale, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D6273]
I expected more!

Id: [0x002D6274]
I see you slowing down!

Id: [0x002D6275]
Bit off a little more than you could...drink!

Id: [0x002D6281]
Yes! Let's get to it!

Id: [0x002D6282]
It's drinking time!

Id: [0x002D6284]
Run! Run, you sluggards! Have you no appetite?

Id: [0x002D6285]
This meat is not to be missed!

Id: [0x002D6286]
I can almost taste its flesh!

Id: [0x002D6287]
I hunger for a haunch!

Id: [0x002D6288]
Ha, Ha! What a beast! What a monster!

Id: [0x002D628A]
O, I have never felt more alive!

Id: [0x002D629A]
The guardian of this temple was a proud man, kingly in nature, but not in fact. A protector of holy wisdom.

Id: [0x002D629B]
And this Protector had a wife, a scholar, who spent her days reading ancient tomes and deciphering the secrets of the desert.

Id: [0x002D629C]
Together they had a son, in whom they hoped to instill all their skill and knowledge. The boy was to be a union of their love.

Id: [0x002D629D]
But then it came to pass that the king of that land arrived to seize the temple for himself. The Protector resisted.

Id: [0x002D629E]
In the battle that followed, the boy was killed and the temple was taken. Struck with grief, the Protector and the Scholar separated.

Id: [0x002D629F]
Indeed. But for a long time, the Protector and the Scholar followed solitary paths, seeking for a way to revenge their son.

Id: [0x002D62A0]
But in their isolation, they found only anguish and pain. Alone, they could do nothing but weep and thrash at the fates.

Id: [0x002D62A1]
After many fruitless years, they came together again to mourn their failure. They embraced as they had in their youth.

Id: [0x002D62A2]
And in that joining they realized what was missing. Only the union that had produced their son would lead to their victory.

Id: [0x002D62A3]
So the Protector taught the Scholar to fight and ride and seek, while the Scholar taught the Protector wisdom and deep knowledge.

Id: [0x002D62A4]
As they trained and studied, they became inseparable, moving, eating, sleeping as one. They were never seen apart.

Id: [0x002D62A5]
Until one day, they met upon the river's edge. They had learned all they could, her from him. Him from her.

Id: [0x002D62A7]
It is said, however, that once every year, two eagles would return to that very spot, to linger and look upon the sea.

Id: [0x002D62A8]
The people of the region liked to see these eagles, for they are an omen, a symbol of protection.

Id: [0x002D62A9]
Perhaps. Still others say that the eagles were their children, born of a love that could never endure. But who is to say for sure?

Id: [0x002D62AA]
A king who kills a child is an ergi (coward)! They should kill him back!

Id: [0x002D62AB]
They turned into birds! Like Loki became a salmon!

Id: [0x002D62AE]
Though this battle you may win, this war you will not. Your foe will be your master, your hope will be your grief.

Id: [0x002D62B0]
Go then. With great care. But know that the home you leave will not be the home to which you return.

Id: [0x002D62B1]
Speak clearly, Valka. What have you seen?

Id: [0x002D62B2]
Speak clearly, Valka. What have you seen?

Id: [0x002D62B3]
I owe this fight to my friends and allies, and I will see it through.

Id: [0x002D62B4]
I owe this fight to my friends and allies, and I will see it through.

Id: [0x002D6304]
Aelfred gave me a key to unlock his study. Somewhere in Wincestre.

Id: [0x002D6305]
Aelfred gave me a key to unlock his study. Somewhere in Wincestre.

Id: [0x002D6307]
This is it, Aelfred's study. What secrets has he kept hidden away?

Id: [0x002D6308]
This is it, Aelfred's study. What secrets has he kept hidden away?

Id: [0x002D630A]
Rantings and ravings, not unlike Fulke's delusions. Is there more to all this than I understand?

Id: [0x002D630B]
Rantings and ravings, not unlike Fulke's delusions. Is there more to all this than I understand?

Id: [0x002D6324]
Ubba. So Aelfred spoke true. May you join your brother, old friend. Wherever he found his final peace.

Id: [0x002D6325]
Ubba. So Aelfred spoke true. May you join your brother, old friend. Wherever he found his final peace.

Id: [0x002D6326]
Their prayers go unanswered this day. [beat]We should find Soma.

Id: [0x002D6327]
Their prayers go unanswered this day. [beat]We should find Soma.

Id: [0x002D6328]
Saxons ahead!

Id: [0x002D6329]
Saxons ahead!

Id: [0x002D6330]
I will follow your lead.

Id: [0x002D6331]
We can tread quietly so as not to alert the guards.

Id: [0x002D6332]
We can tread quietly so as not to alert the guards.

Id: [0x002D6333]
But I can raid this place in moments with my crew.

Id: [0x002D6334]
But I can raid this place in moments with my crew.

Id: [0x002D6342]
How will you celebrate this yule?

Id: [0x002D6343]
This midwinter feast is a joy. Fills me with hope to the return of the spring sun.

Id: [0x002D6344]
Come by, we will raise a cup of mead to friends and good cheer.

Id: [0x002D6345]
Here I am, on a cold night without even a drop of mead to warm my belly. Some Christ mass this is.

Id: [0x002D634A]
Yes, my lord.

Id: [0x002D6350]
I fooled her! I told her you were a witch and you were going to eat me for supper!

Id: [0x002D6361]
But, we must first practice our raiding.

Id: [0x002D6363]
Crawling back for the legionnaire, I see.

Id: [0x002D636B]
We'll soak the beach in blood, we will. [laugh]No gold hoard is safe from us!

Id: [0x002D636C]
Listen up, crew! Sharpen your blades and your wits. We will go a-pillaging, we will!

Id: [0x002D637F]
Please! Make a path through the jars so I can get out. And-and, don't break any. The smell is awful!

Id: [0x002D6389]
O. It's no pleasure being defeated. The hill is yours. You're the true champion.

Id: [0x002D638C]
Never forget that.

Id: [0x002D638D]
Never forget that.

Id: [0x002D638F]
O! Just you try.

Id: [0x002D6396]
If you think you can win, love … I am eager to indulge you.

Id: [0x002D6397]
Let's have a drinking contest. You against me!

Id: [0x002D6398]
Let's have a drinking contest. You against me!

Id: [0x002D6399]
Let's play some dice, shall we?

Id: [0x002D639A]
Let's play some dice, shall we?

Id: [0x002D639B]
That would be lovely. I was just about to get in some archery practice if you'd like to join me.

Id: [0x002D63A5]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002D63A6]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002D63AB]
This is my land, I was here first. So as I said, bring me viper eggs, and I'll make sure they leave and never come back.

Id: [0x002D63AD]
Of course. I was about to go sink my line in the river. Care to join me?

Id: [0x002D63AF]
Lead the way!

Id: [0x002D63B0]
We should go fishing.

Id: [0x002D63B1]
We should go fishing.

Id: [0x002D63B2]
If you are keen to meet him, he asks that you join him at his war camp. I have the location here.

Id: [0x002D63BC]
Our jarl has returned … to lead us forward into an uncertain future.

Id: [0x002D63BF]
Careful, I might have let you win.

Id: [0x002D63C0]
Think of it this way … at least you're losing to someone who won't gloat. Not very much.

Id: [0x002D63C2]
Very impressive. I hope you're ready for how you'll feel in the morning.

Id: [0x002D63C3]
Drink some water, I think. Might go down easier.

Id: [0x002D63C8]
I pay my penance within these walls, never to see light of sun again.

Id: [0x002D63C9]
A sinner am I, the joys of life I have forsaken.

Id: [0x002D63CA]
I'm fitting to gobble you up.

Id: [0x002D63CB]
Eivor, hail! We have not laid eyes on you for some ten winters now.

Id: [0x002D63CC]
O, is it? Or have you come to snatch glory from my calloused hands?

Id: [0x002D63CD]
Must I remind you of your own disrobed adventures in the predawn streets of Stavenger?

Id: [0x002D63CE]
I do not give you leave to go!

Id: [0x002D63CF]
Put your weapon away. There is no need to fight.

Id: [0x002D63D0]
You died once, you will again!

Id: [0x002D63D1]
He promised rebellion? Are you sure this was wise?

Id: [0x002D63D2]
After years of blood and gore, looting and burning, forgive us if we don't trust a Dane.

Id: [0x002D63D3]
If you're truly fighting that devil Rhodri, I'll tell you what I know.

Id: [0x002D63D4]
Even when we aren't saying a word, your company is wonderful. Thank you for a beautiful day.

Id: [0x002D63D8]
You continue to pray.

Id: [0x002D63D9]
You continue to pray.

Id: [0x002D63E8]
Yes. For mercy and peace.

Id: [0x002D63EA]
I have no need.

Id: [0x002D63EB]
I do not understand. I can do nothing for you.

Id: [0x002D63EC]
I do not understand. I can do nothing for you.

Id: [0x002D63EE]
So. Now I am King of the Hill.

Id: [0x002D63EF]
So. Now I am the King of the Hill.

Id: [0x002D6410]
You swore an oath to never spill my blood!

Id: [0x002D6411]
You come like a Valkyrie out of the fog. But we have no dead to give you.

Id: [0x002D642F]
The earth's beauty renews us. Thank you, stranger. My life begins anew.

Id: [0x002D6447]
This crate has all of your written songs. This is not a gift I can accept or repay.

Id: [0x002D6448]
This crate has all of your written songs. This is not a gift I can accept or repay.

Id: [0x002D644A]
I had forgotten all about them. Something to work at on this new journey of mine.

Id: [0x002D644B]
You will want to revisit these someday. They should stay with you.

Id: [0x002D644C]
You'll want to revisit these someday. They should stay with you.

Id: [0x002D644E]
You have only the setting sun to tell you when to stop.

Id: [0x002D644F]
You have only the setting sun to tell you when to stop.

Id: [0x002D6450]
And maybe not even then! That is twice you have earned my admiration. Please, tell me your name.

Id: [0x002D6452]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6453]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6454]
Eivor. If the gods will it, I will find my seat at Odin's table before you.

Id: [0x002D6455]
And there I will speak of you, so that when the time comes to claim your seat, they will greet you by name. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D64C4]
Suttungr the Wise! Hah! He was a fool to trust an outsider.

Id: [0x002D64C5]
Wait till I get my hands on that stunty little godling.

Id: [0x002D64C6]
How generous … and entirely unlike him. You used to be much better at lying.

Id: [0x002D64C7]
You know much, Far-Seer. But not enough to save you.

Id: [0x002D64C8]
Did you think I would not come for you, after what you did to my son?

Id: [0x002D64C9]
I see she let you live. You must have done something right.

Id: [0x002D64CA]
You are not as ox-witted as I feared.

Id: [0x002D64CB]
You are small to my eyes, stranger.

Id: [0x002D64CC]
Have a care, though. You are safe in my presence, but you wander Utgard at your peril.

Id: [0x002D64CD]
And Havi … be kind. Gunlodr is … different from you and I.

Id: [0x002D64CE]
No, not yet. Listen. I want you to hear the voices.

Id: [0x002D64CF]
Should I use smaller words so you can understand? Come back, I am not finished.

Id: [0x002D64D0]
Havi, your feast is prepared. I hope it pleases you.

Id: [0x002D64D2]
Now we will hear from our honored guest! The Lord of the Aesir has come in peace, and brought us a mighty gift. Attend!

Id: [0x002D64D3]
Found your courage, have you? Are you ready to face our champion now?

Id: [0x002D64D4]
A brave try, but you have failed.

Id: [0x002D64D5]
You have not yet learned the lesson, then?

Id: [0x002D64D6]
Indeed, you are mighty! You have fought old age and won. No one has ever done that before.

Id: [0x002D64D7]
All of you! Empty your horns for Havi!

Id: [0x002D64D8]
They beat the champion? Nobody's ever beaten the champion!

Id: [0x002D64D9]
Drink in the name of Havi!

Id: [0x002D64DA]
Ha! That's a condition I'll gladly accept. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002D64DB]
Did you forget your mead? Drink from the cup and start again.

Id: [0x002D64DC]
Not so easy after supping at the brook of the cheer-cup, eh? When you feel ready, take a drink and try again.

Id: [0x002D64DD]
I enjoy a good riddle. How did you know?

Id: [0x002D64DE]
Not me, friend. My name is Thokk.

Id: [0x002D64DF]
Havi! Why are you here?

Id: [0x002D64E0]
You are a thief and an agent of chaos. I'll see you pay for this deceit. Guards!

Id: [0x002D64E1]
Betrayer! Deceiver! I treated you as an honored guest, and this is how you repay me?

Id: [0x002D64E2]
Someone needed to warn my people of the treachery in your heart. Suttungr, show this Aesir how the Jotnar deal with thieves.

Id: [0x002D64E3]
What have you done with my daughter?

Id: [0x002D64E4]
You would gamble with uncountable lives!

Id: [0x002D64E5]
Deceiver! False-tongue! Dishonorable trickster!

Id: [0x002D64E6]
I will take that Mead from your dead hands, thief!

Id: [0x002D64E7]
Oath-breaker? I did to you what you did to my son. This is only fair.

Id: [0x002D64E8]
Don't blame me for your own lack of character. You stole the Mead!

Id: [0x002D64E9]
That is the truth now. But how it will gnaw at you, knowing that to kill my son will undo your doom.

Id: [0x002D64EB]
You might be strongest, but I was ever the quicker one!

Id: [0x002D64EC]
Do not be so sure of that. The game is not over. The game is never over.

Id: [0x002D64ED]
You who seek immortality may find it within these waters. But there is a price.

Id: [0x002D64EE]
You never did.

Id: [0x002D64EF]
Let's finish this now! You and me!

Id: [0x002D64F0]
I haven't forgotten, Eivor. And I won't, for fear that you might remind me.

Id: [0x002D64F1]
Eivor, I wondered if I would ever see you again. It's … it's good to see you.

Id: [0x002D64F2]
He respected you, Eivor. If not for you, he might have remained just as you found him. A naive boy, devoid of experience.

Id: [0x002D64F3]
May God bless you, Eivor. Whatever remains of my son in this world, I believe it travels with you.

Id: [0x002D64F4]
Do not get in my way, Eivor. This is something I need to do.

Id: [0x002D64F5]
Eivor … why does it not surprise me to see you here.

Id: [0x002D64F6]
I'm glad you and your brother have come. If only to bring some measure of calm.

Id: [0x002D64F7]
Your voice, Eivor. You sound different than the brothers.

Id: [0x002D64F9]
As will I.

Id: [0x002D64FA]
I'm eager to see you fight, Eivor. Show us old wolves a thing or two.

Id: [0x002D64FB]
Let's make short work of this, Eivor. England is a big place.

Id: [0x002D64FC]
I know these men, Eivor. I've supped with them. Not two weeks ago, Leofrith showed me how to wield a greatsword. He's a friend.

Id: [0x002D64FD]
We're a long way from Fornberg, Eivor. This … this is our destiny.

Id: [0x002D64FE]
Eivor … a word if you would.

Id: [0x002D64FF]
Ubba and Ivarr gathered their men and set off in different directions. You should follow up with them.

Id: [0x002D6500]
We'll go see Tonna, just the two of us. Ivarr and Ubba will wait here. Better if Tonna thinks we've come alone.

Id: [0x002D6501]
No, no. You have shot your chance. And if you show your faces around here once more, I will tear you limb from limb.

Id: [0x002D6502]
Eivor. Tell us you learned something.

Id: [0x002D6503]
Eivor, there you are.

Id: [0x002D6504]
Ah, Eivor, I have dreamt of this day.

Id: [0x002D6505]
You hear that, Eivor? Noble. Selfless. This is the sort you must strike a bargain with. A woman of quality.

Id: [0x002D6506]
Quite the catch, Eivor. She is as much a poet as you.

Id: [0x002D6507]
You'll have to kill me!

Id: [0x002D6508]
Ceolbert is there. Eivor, you must save my son.

Id: [0x002D650A]
I swore an oath to serve Burgred to the death. I fought. I lost. We both know how this goes.

Id: [0x002D650B]
I threw myself at him, Eivor. But he only toyed with me. He knew I couldn't touch him.

Id: [0x002D650C]
Ah! A reaping of flesh from the wave!

Id: [0x002D650D]
Yet here you are, back with the old clan. That is what matters most.

Id: [0x002D650F]
Vili waits for you below, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6510]
Searching for the chickens you let loose before the Yule feast, I'll have you remember.

Id: [0x002D6511]
Thank you, drengr. Thank you!

Id: [0x002D6512]
Eivor! Eivor, where are you? Get over here!

Id: [0x002D6513]
Eivor! Over here!

Id: [0x002D6514]
I will get the man, Eivor. You carry the woman!

Id: [0x002D6515]
It is good to have you watching my back again, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6516]
The novelty of this soggy North has worn on me, Eivor. Too warm for winter living, too cold for summer.

Id: [0x002D6517]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002D6518]
Eivor. Hemming Jarl still clings to life.

Id: [0x002D6519]
Drengr.

Id: [0x002D651A]
There's a heaviness to your look, Eivor. What troubles you?

Id: [0x002D651B]
I could not give you any more counsel in life, Eivor. So too in death am I rendered silent.

Id: [0x002D651C]
And that is why my words should land true. Trust your judgment.

Id: [0x002D651E]
Have no regrets, Eivor. You have given me the great battle-death I sought in life.

Id: [0x002D651F]
And were your questions answered?

Id: [0x002D6520]
Gods, Eivor. Put a stop to this fool's death wish.

Id: [0x002D6521]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6522]
I … I want you, Eivor. Your warmth. Your touch.

Id: [0x002D6523]
I cannot say how I will feel tomorrow, Eivor…

Id: [0x002D6524]
Eivor. My father sets forth on his final voyage.

Id: [0x002D6525]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6526]
I mourn for myself, Eivor. For us. You know my heart. It beats for the passion of battle-heat. Not … not this.

Id: [0x002D6527]
I will follow these new tracks, Eivor. Wherever they may lead.

Id: [0x002D6528]
Yes, yes. You're right. And certainly if you can lead, a Hemmingson can.

Id: [0x002D6529]
My future is elsewhere, Trygve. I will go with Eivor, to live and fight beside the Raven Clan.

Id: [0x002D652A]
Until my path leads me home, I serve under your banner, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D652B]
And you, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D652C]
I find it hard to believe you have a heart at all, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D652D]
But you could hardly control yourself. Always putting your own glory above the welfare of your clan.

Id: [0x002D652E]
I did not find it, Eivor. I chose it … the only way forward that did not lead to more violence and death and grief.

Id: [0x002D652F]
I was a father to you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6530]
I know you love him, Eivor. I know you trust him. But do not follow him blindly into darkness or despair.

Id: [0x002D6531]
Look after him, Eivor. And if you have the chance, lead him back from the edge of the abyss.

Id: [0x002D6532]
They are real, Eivor. And this is no mere foxhunt. Where I take you now, few men have ever seen.

Id: [0x002D6533]
Good, Eivor … I would not lead you blindly into the unknown. Have faith that what I know is true, and where we go is real.

Id: [0x002D6534]
This ordeal with the Elf King, Aelfred. How far have you pushed him? Does he bend? Will he break?

Id: [0x002D6535]
Eivor, where are you going?

Id: [0x002D6536]
Eivor, we do not have time to waste!

Id: [0x002D6537]
Eivor, we will press on. The rest of you, wait here!

Id: [0x002D6538]
Ah, the sting of ice on skin! Revel in this, Eivor. We walk the footpath of the gods!

Id: [0x002D6539]
You need not fear the cold, Eivor. Where we are going the winds and snows cannot touch!

Id: [0x002D653A]
You will see soon enough.

Id: [0x002D653B]
I told you, Eivor. My visions are memories. Of a life once lived. Come.

Id: [0x002D653C]
Trust this place, Eivor. This old and sacred place.

Id: [0x002D653D]
You speak for yourself, Eivor. For I am no mortal. I see that now. I know it.

Id: [0x002D653E]
Glory eternal, Eivor! Here we dine in the great hall of the slain. At long last! O, I want to scream with joy!

Id: [0x002D653F]
Eivor! Over here!

Id: [0x002D6540]
Face me, drengr! Show me what you are made of!

Id: [0x002D6541]
Enough with those sword-flies. You and I must fight.

Id: [0x002D6542]
Worry not, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6543]
It was never gone, Eivor. Not truly. Nothing is permanent here, I told you. Nothing save the courage and reputation of its warriors.

Id: [0x002D6544]
Eivor, you have a guest!

Id: [0x002D6545]
Eivor, enjoy this! Your father has returned.

Id: [0x002D6547]
I am humbled to walk with you, Eivor. Your reputation is a song warriors will sing forever.

Id: [0x002D6548]
You have felled many great foes in your brief time.

Id: [0x002D6549]
Eivor! Stand!

Id: [0x002D654A]
My son, Eivor. This is about my son!

Id: [0x002D654B]
Dig, Eivor. Into the wellspring of your memory!

Id: [0x002D654C]
Eivor! Stun him beneath the arms of the tree!

Id: [0x002D654D]
I am not mad, Eivor. These things I see and feel … I know they are true.

Id: [0x002D654E]
Eivor. On our journey here, I had much time to think. On the ecstasies and agonies of our friendship.

Id: [0x002D654F]
I welcome this turn of kindness, Eivor. But my mind is fixed.

Id: [0x002D6550]
Well … I hope, for your sake, that you grow well into the role you have earned today. That hope is all I have left.

Id: [0x002D6551]
Eivor, here's a tune for you! One to liven your step.

Id: [0x002D6552]
Good. Tonight, you will be the cord that unites our people. And I'm so proud of you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6554]
Can we show Sigurd the cairn stones we stacked yesterday?

Id: [0x002D6555]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002D6556]
Eivor, save the introductions until our bellies are full. I will see my father, tell him of my time away.

Id: [0x002D6557]
You're a long way from home, Eivor. Hm.

Id: [0x002D6558]
Eivor. A great pleasure to see you again.

Id: [0x002D6559]
Eivor, this was among Ceolbert's possessions. I'm certain he would've wanted you to have it.

Id: [0x002D655A]
God go with you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D655B]
I'd like you both to be there. To guide me, to judge my fitness.

Id: [0x002D655C]
Enough! This is a house of God! Let us take some few minutes to gather ourselves, shall we? Eivor, to me.

Id: [0x002D655D]
The treasure you spoke of would help bring us to peace.

Id: [0x002D655E]
At the crown? I would leap at the chance to rule. But a man needs wealth to bring down a king. Nobles must be bought, you understand.

Id: [0x002D655F]
Hmph. And you, go take a shit and let me know how it turns out.

Id: [0x002D6561]
Hold a moment. If you need extra help…

Id: [0x002D6562]
Eivor! I'm ready to get back at them Britons. You'll not see me lagging behind, doin' nothing but looting corpses.

Id: [0x002D6563]
You bruised his pride, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6564]
I stand bewildered, Eivor. In the blink of an eye, years of blood and sweat are put to an end.

Id: [0x002D6565]
Hej, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6566]
Only him, drengr. You will have to wait until he sleeps it off.

Id: [0x002D6567]
Ei … Eivor … I…

Id: [0x002D6568]
Eivor, hello. Another dark day clouds our victory.

Id: [0x002D6569]
I am always one who desires the truth Eivor, but this … this is a hard thing to hear. Did he die well?

Id: [0x002D656A]
Son of Loki, have I not treated you with kindness? We are bonded, you and I. And as I trust my king, so you may trust me.

Id: [0x002D656B]
Here you die, Deceiver!

Id: [0x002D656D]
None living or dead now equal our Havi in arrogance. To believe that you could remake your fate thus…

Id: [0x002D656E]
Is that why you've come? To back this thegn (nobleman) who smells of goat shit and sheep pebbles?

Id: [0x002D656F]
Eivor, wait.

Id: [0x002D6570]
Eivor. Eivor, come.

Id: [0x002D6571]
Thank you, Eivor. Now and forever, I am pledged to you.

Id: [0x002D6572]
Good Rosta, go.<LF>Not you, Eivor. Not just yet.

Id: [0x002D6573]
Come. Eivor…

Id: [0x002D6574]
Eivor, what is it?

Id: [0x002D6575]
Hold off, Eivor. First we talk.

Id: [0x002D6576]
Eivor! No!

Id: [0x002D657A]
Fare thee well, brave hero! Perhaps we will meet again.

Id: [0x002D657C]
Gods, I hope not.

Id: [0x002D657D]
Gods, I hope not.

Id: [0x002D65B1]
The battle-horn is sounded! Men! Make the blood-rain fall in a thunderstorm!

Id: [0x002D65B4]
I see you! Mother is going to be so angry.

Id: [0x002D65B5]
Walter! This isn't funny anymore!

Id: [0x002D65B7]
A message in a bottle? [beat, as if reading]Ah, wise. Hid a necklace in a cow's stomach. Guess you'll have to go fishing for the rest of the treasure.

Id: [0x002D65B8]
Walter! Stay in the bushes!

Id: [0x002D65B9]
Don't call me names.

Id: [0x002D65BA]
Pudding head! Pudding head!

Id: [0x002D65BB]
Good evening.

Id: [0x002D65BC]
Good evening.

Id: [0x002D65C1]
I have come to rhyme with you.

Id: [0x002D65C2]
I have come to rhyme with you.

Id: [0x002D66F1]
Are you ready to rhyme with me?

Id: [0x002D66F2]
Are you ready to rhyme with me?

Id: [0x002D6706]
I've come to trade barbs for cake and ale!

Id: [0x002D6707]
I've come to trade barbs for cake and ale!

Id: [0x002D6755]
What? No fish?

Id: [0x002D6757]
I cannot even weep!

Id: [0x002D6759]
Damn the fate the Nornir have spun!

Id: [0x002D675E]
I was pledged to her well before I knew her. And though we have tried to settle our differences and find love in our faults…

Id: [0x002D675F]
It has not worked out. And so we have dissolved our bond. Yet as a clan, we will grow together.

Id: [0x002D6907]
Felled by arrows. His eyes been scooped from his head. Too clean to be gouged.

O, hello, little one.

O, hello, little one.

Id: [0x002D6932]
That was a little weird, but I like it.

Id: [0x002D6934]
Good--

Id: [0x002D6935]
Good--

Id: [0x002D693C]
Great work. Try to keep out of trouble.

Id: [0x002D693D]
Great work. Try to keep out of trouble.

Id: [0x002D693E]
I don't make promises I can't keep. But, you paid me in full, so I won't break your knees.

Id: [0x002D6943]
Odd jobs for coin! Odd jobs for coin!

Id: [0x002D6952]
(weeping)

Id: [0x002D6980]
Thank you. Hope we do it again.

Id: [0x002D6981]
Thank you. Hope we do it again.

Id: [0x002D698B]
I ended up snooping around that abandoned camp, and that's when they showed up. Bears! So many bears. I must catch my breath…

Id: [0x002D698E]
It seems his sons have been hiding here, awaiting their chance to take it back.

Id: [0x002D6993]
What is an Aesir doing here?

Id: [0x002D6994]
Suttungr keeps strange company. Strange company indeed.

Id: [0x002D6995]
An Aesir? I think I've lost my appetite.

Id: [0x002D6996]
Must we drink to our enemies now?

…buried by the Jotnar in ages past.

Nine days I hung in the tree! Nine days, you hear me!

Then I threw my eye in the well! [whimper]This is wisdom!

Dead these last three years and buried under the flowers she loved. I wanted to move on, but I cannot bear to leave her.

I will not let sentimentality be the shackles of my soul. I will find work in the village. Even meet a girl and start my own family.

And tell them stories of magic, heroes, and fair maidens.

You are right. She was always so happy, laughing and singing. It would break her heart to see me so forlorn.

Many lose loved ones. And they do not bind themselves with grief-shackles. Your mother is at peace.

Id: [0x002D69DA]

You are right. But now I beg you, leave me to my sorrow.

I hope you find what you are looking for. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D69DE]
I hope you find what you are looking for. Farewell.

Id: [0x002D69E0]
You are a firestarter!

Id: [0x002D69E2]
But that madman, the self-proclaimed Bishop of the Ruins is our biggest critic. He calls our playing "the Devil's bagpipes."

Id: [0x002D69E3]
A worthy aim. Maybe he needs convincing of your talents?

Id: [0x002D69E4]
A worthy aim. Maybe he needs convincing of your talents?

Id: [0x002D69E5]
You would volunteer?[beat] Ah! You are a lover of fine music, this is surely an omen!

Id: [0x002D69E6]
Music is the Devil's work!

Id: [0x002D69E7]
Go back to the hellhole you crawled out of.

Id: [0x002D69E8]
Dancing! Music! Songs and poems, they are all Satan's dark dalliance!

Id: [0x002D69EA]
Why not let the boy play music? He brings pleasure to the people.

Id: [0x002D69EB]
Why not let the boy play music? He brings pleasure to the people.

Then you and I must disagree.

Then you and I must disagree.

Id: [0x002D69EE]
Whoa! A horse. Easy there, big fellow. I pray you, take care with the bumps.

Id: [0x002D69F0]
It is God-given! He spoke to me as I stood one night pissing against the stones. I am his instrument to stamp out the Devil's tune.

Id: [0x002D69F1]
Bishop of the Ruins? Is this title Aelfred-given?

Id: [0x002D69F2]
Bishop of the Ruins? Is this title Aelfred-given?

Id: [0x002D6A84]
And you are brave to darken my door alone. Where is my lover, the dark fox that slinks between my sheets?

Id: [0x002D6A90]
[laugh]Let me help you down from there.

Id: [0x002D6A99]
Your name is known to me. But what could mighty Suttungr want that a little thing like you can provide?

Id: [0x002D6A9A]
Well spoken, Havi. Our people may be enemies, but you have earned your welcome here.

Id: [0x002D6AAB]
Do not be downhearted. You may battle old age, but old age will win in the end.

Id: [0x002D6AAD]
Ah, but can you do it while mead-addled? Before each attempt, you must take a drink.

Id: [0x002D6AAE]
You return! Keen to stretch your bowstring?

Id: [0x002D6AB0]
You look a bit wobbly there. Careful!

Id: [0x002D6ACE]
Curse you, Havi.

Id: [0x002D6AD7]
Follow me. I'll give you the tour.

Id: [0x002D6AD8]
I am doing my part. I hope you have come to do yours. We are going to need all the help we can get for what comes next.

Id: [0x002D6AD9]
How can I answer that with any hope that you'd believe me? I only want what is best for the people of Mercia.

Id: [0x002D6ADA]
And the thunder of shields, yes! It's good to have you with us.

Id: [0x002D6ADB]
From where do you come, if I may ask?

Id: [0x002D6ADC]
Ceolwulf, you mean?[laugh] When I've done with you lot, I'll execute that foolish thegn for treason!

Id: [0x002D6ADD]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002D6ADE]
There you are. Are we ready to march?

Id: [0x002D6ADF]
Nothing. You?

Id: [0x002D6AE0]
Meet us at Tonna's camp when you're finished here. And bring your patience.

Id: [0x002D6AE1]
Ivarr did tell you to bring your axe.

Id: [0x002D6AE2]
No, no. This is your challenge.

Id: [0x002D6AE3]
Very well. I could use another cow. You can cover the cost.

Id: [0x002D6AE4]
You've got stones.

Id: [0x002D6AE5]
I take you for desperate beggars. I can smell it on you, like dung heap. Now that's my price. What say you?

Id: [0x002D6AE6]
Well, that is not the result I was hoping for. I hope you have another idea.

Id: [0x002D6AE7]
Why are you still here?

Id: [0x002D6AE8]
There's nothing left for you here.

Id: [0x002D6AE9]
Didn't you hear me? Back off.

Id: [0x002D6AEA]
I am taking your head back to the Ragnarssons. That'll teach them to cross me.

Id: [0x002D6AEB]
Do you hear that? The sounds of battle.

Id: [0x002D6AEC]
The Saxons won't welcome us through the front door. We could find a quiet way in, or we can take your longship. I'm beside you either way.

Id: [0x002D6AED]
Of going a-vikingr! With you! With our brothers and sisters! Conquering new lands. Forming lasting friendships.

Id: [0x002D6AEE]
Let me go! I demand it!

Id: [0x002D6AEF]
You're wasting your time. I won't talk. Not to you, not to any of you barbarians.

Id: [0x002D6AF0]
You don't frighten me.

Id: [0x002D6AF1]
You … you are asking me to betray my husband! How can I do that?

Id: [0x002D6AF2]
Try not to drag the entire king's guard behind you.

Id: [0x002D6AF3]
We will secure the bridge at Venonis. When you have Burgred, ride straight there.

Id: [0x002D6AF4]
Stay back! Back, I say! I'll fight you!

Id: [0x002D6AF5]
You're a blight on this world! The whole lot of you. A rancid disease!

Id: [0x002D6AF6]
I'll send you back to the Ragnarssons in pieces.

Id: [0x002D6AF7]
Right behind you.

Id: [0x002D6AF8]
Trouble ahead. Go, we'll cover you.

Id: [0x002D6AF9]
Your death will come, Danes. Your end was writ the moment you came for me. I have made damned sure of that!

Id: [0x002D6AFA]
Guided by Odin's sight, you are!

Id: [0x002D6AFB]
You lie…

Id: [0x002D6AFC]
Your name is on this scroll. At Burgred's request, I put it there. When it is found, the Zealots who read it will hunt you.

Id: [0x002D6AFD]
It doesn't matter now, you haven't much time. Burn the scroll. Or they will never stop hunting you.

Id: [0x002D6AFE]
It was. It was our fight. Yours, mine, my father's. I had to help.

Id: [0x002D6AFF]
Back there, with Leofrith … I didn't think you'd spare him.

Id: [0x002D6B00]
You have my thanks, all of you. And my blessing.

Id: [0x002D6B01]
You and Sigurd make a good pair. The future of England will be pagan from top to bottom.

Id: [0x002D6B02]
If we ever cross paths again, I know you are someone I can count on. I hope you know the same is true for me.

Id: [0x002D6B03]
And you accept it. Unlike my son. He thinks me immortal … because he must. He does not want what I have to give him.

Id: [0x002D6B04]
There you are, come! Ride with me to the falls. They are Freyja's gift to these unforgiving lands.

Id: [0x002D6B05]
I told you, that was meant to be a dragon's tail--

Id: [0x002D6B06]
You fight with impressive skill, I should say. I taught you well, I think.

Id: [0x002D6B07]
You do not need me in that seat to secure an alliance. You and Sigurd are beloved here.

Id: [0x002D6B08]
I beg of you now … do not let my lessons die. Pass them on.

Id: [0x002D6B09]
[laugh]It was something I had hoped to give him in life. You must see it to believe it.

Id: [0x002D6B0A]
Trygve has tasked me to help the volva with the sacrifices. Could we speak with her to ease your thoughts?

Id: [0x002D6B0B]
I would take you there myself, but I have Isbjorn to retrieve.

Id: [0x002D6B0C]
Hemming Jarl possessed a steady hand and steady heart. Do you possess the same?

Id: [0x002D6B0D]
Your heart is not yet steady.

Id: [0x002D6B0E]
How will you remember him?

Id: [0x002D6B0F]
Is this your choice?

Id: [0x002D6B10]
Is this what you desire?

Id: [0x002D6B11]
Is this your decision?

Id: [0x002D6B13]
You've got the key … use it.

Id: [0x002D6B14]
Yes, yes! I'll walk, I'll walk! Don't hurt me, please! There's a key there. If you open the door I … I will follow you out.

Id: [0x002D6B15]
Thank you, mighty Thor! You've saved my life.

Id: [0x002D6B16]
Please, retrieve my voda, I beg of you! 'Tis my funeral gift! The honor of my family at stake!

Id: [0x002D6B17]
Watch yourself … the voda sneaks up on you quick!

Id: [0x002D6B18]
Your heart is restless. Your mind clouded. You seek more than a guarantee of good omens.

Id: [0x002D6B19]
You wish to know who would best serve this clan as jarl.

Id: [0x002D6B1A]
We stand in the shadow of the giant, the great keeper of secrets. Here you'll find a drink of the resounding sea.

Id: [0x002D6B1B]
Do not seek answers to your questions. They will find you.

Id: [0x002D6B1C]
Ascend the sleeper, take the drink, and meditate at the peak. Let the answers you seek find you.

Id: [0x002D6B1D]
No. I want you to die defending it.

Id: [0x002D6B1E]
Yet you see it coming. You welcome it.

Id: [0x002D6B1F]
No. I want you to die in defense of it.

Id: [0x002D6B20]
I trusted you to make the right decision. I still do.

Id: [0x002D6B21]
Your edge is blunted by indecision. You lead warriors now, never waver.

Id: [0x002D6B23]
The choice you make will be the right one.

Id: [0x002D6B24]
Your place is anywhere you lay your head, any hill you summit, any silver you take for your own. Do not limit yourself to niceties.

Id: [0x002D6B25]
They're not far. I'll show you.

Id: [0x002D6B26]
Well, you have your answer. I'd sooner take after a troll and leave this clan in your hands.

Id: [0x002D6B27]
Do you think Sleipnir would be content bound to a stable, no matter how glorious it may be?

Id: [0x002D6B28]
You … you speak a truth I understand.

Id: [0x002D6B29]
Do you ever wonder what might have happened if we had not been separated by the North Sea so early in our lives?

Id: [0x002D6B2A]
I should get back. Rest. The funeral will still be there when you wake up fully.

Id: [0x002D6B2B]
Only your gift remains. Present what you have and the celebration may begin.

Id: [0x002D6B2C]
I am not so drunk I cannot stand but … hang on to me a moment.

Id: [0x002D6B2D]
My father never swore a formal oath with your clan. There was no need, for you are family.

Id: [0x002D6B2E]
My father placed us side by side, because he trusted your vision. So what do you see?

Id: [0x002D6B2F]
To raid with you and Bragi? Gods, yes. Imagine the blood and mead we would spill.

Id: [0x002D6B30]
Eivor? Is that you again, or does my mind play a cruel trick on me?

Id: [0x002D6B31]
Y-you are right. I owed you the truth, and for that I am sorry. But I will not apologize for what I did.

Id: [0x002D6B32]
Your father would have understood. He died to avoid a similar fate. To save his family, at the cost of his reputation.

Id: [0x002D6B33]
He loved you. That is all.

Id: [0x002D6B34]
No! We must confront the omens and honor the gods. They will not seek or find you. We must go to them.

Id: [0x002D6B35]
The ice looks fragile. Can you clear it?

Id: [0x002D6B36]
And there's more to come. I swear by all the names of the All-Father, this is only a taste of what I have in store for you.

Id: [0x002D6B37]
There! Do you feel that? The sacred energies?

Id: [0x002D6B38]
Take your place at the center there, and you will see.

Id: [0x002D6B39]
There you are!

Id: [0x002D6B3A]
You will taste a meal of iron before the day is out!

Id: [0x002D6B3B]
Cast aside your cares in Valhalla. Let seeking go, we have earned our joy. The journey is complete!

Id: [0x002D6B3C]
Nonsense. I've brought you someone. Look.

Id: [0x002D6B3D]
You remember our great battle? You remember how we fought, side by side, with your mother and Sigurd and our clans united?

Id: [0x002D6B3E]
That was not a lie, that was my gift to you. I have power here. And I can do as I please.

Id: [0x002D6B3F]
Your father died doing what he hoped would save you. He died to protect you. And his clan.

Id: [0x002D6B40]
Am I destined to follow you everywhere? 'Til the end of my life?

Id: [0x002D6B41]
How dare you deny me!

Id: [0x002D6B42]
Your place is here! With me!

Id: [0x002D6B43]
Do not flee your destiny!

Id: [0x002D6B44]
Why do you flee from the truth!

Id: [0x002D6B45]
Take up your axe!

Id: [0x002D6B46]
Leave me now and you are nothing!

Id: [0x002D6B47]
With me you have wisdom! Glory! Power! What more do you need!

Id: [0x002D6B48]
You must suffer. A thousand times what I suffered.

Id: [0x002D6B49]
I have waited countless ages for this moment. No more talk! I hunger for this kill.

Id: [0x002D6B4A]
Show me your neck! Show me!

Id: [0x002D6B4B]
When I have finished, you will be a sack of blood and shattered bones.

Id: [0x002D6B4C]
You will not die in peace.

Id: [0x002D6B4D]
You will never see your home or your people again!

Id: [0x002D6B4E]
I cannot return to England with you. That is not my home … not now.

Id: [0x002D6B4F]
I know about you and Randvi. A lover's tryst, in spite of me.

Id: [0x002D6B50]
I should challenge you for such a betrayal, but I'm … I'm not fit for such a fight.

Id: [0x002D6B51]
Do you recall the day we stood before Eadwyn, searching for the Saga Stone?

Id: [0x002D6B52]
All right … all right … I will come. But only if I may counsel you from time to time, to be better than you are.

Id: [0x002D6B53]
And you hold it out like this and look him in the eyes and you say, "Styrbjorn King, may our clans be forever bonded in friendship and in love."

Id: [0x002D6B54]
You think you can do that for me?

Id: [0x002D6B55]
There you are!

Id: [0x002D6B56]
O!

Id: [0x002D6B57]
Give it here.

Id: [0x002D6B58]
Suit yourself.

Id: [0x002D6B59]
So, you have the ring? Good.

Id: [0x002D6B5A]
This was worn by your grandfather in a battle on the Northern Way.

Id: [0x002D6B5B]
Now go. You have a gift to deliver.

Id: [0x002D6B5C]
When you speak with the king, hold it up to the light, show him the fine details.

Id: [0x002D6B5D]
See there? I etched his name in runes, on the outer bend. You'll show him?

Id: [0x002D6B5E]
How do we fix this? How are you the key to everything?

Id: [0x002D6B5F]
I shall. The Kingdom of Gwynedd thanks you.

Id: [0x002D6B60]
So I am. And a bruised pawn in your bloody game.

Id: [0x002D6B61]
If you speak true, I would make that bargain gladly.

Id: [0x002D6B62]
Is it not plain that I do not wish to speak with you?

Id: [0x002D6B63]
You again. What of the silver you spoke of?

Id: [0x002D6B64]
When you have pacified the place, I'll meet you there. What a mess all this has become. What a terrible mess.

Id: [0x002D6B65]
If you find yourself in a pitched fight, call out his name in praise. The workers will rally to you.

Id: [0x002D6B66]
Cowards! Quit your hiding spots and fight me, Ynyr! Son of Cadfarch! Killer of Danes.

Id: [0x002D6B67]
In return, you pledge to end all hostilities as of this moment.

Id: [0x002D6B68]
As we have come to peace by another path, I return your silver in form of a small gift. Please accept this.

Id: [0x002D6B69]
Ceolbert must learn the good news. Will you tell him when you see him?

Id: [0x002D6B6A]
A few hours should do it. Unless you find another way to rouse him.

Id: [0x002D6B6B]
Keep this to yourself, but once or twice when I needed a quick word … I dumped him in a lake.

Id: [0x002D6B6C]
So you set me afire? Wrath of Surtr!

Id: [0x002D6B6D]
Yours is a piss-poor way of looking!

Id: [0x002D6B6E]
If you must know, the little brat went off hunting boar some time ago.

Id: [0x002D6B6F]
You?

Id: [0x002D6B70]
Therefore, Sciropescire declares herself your friend and ally, and will remain so for the length of my days.

Id: [0x002D6B7D]
Ysane, Kitt, and Cynewulf. That is all The Gleemen. Now we will see if they play the square.

Id: [0x002D6B7E]
Ysane, Kitt, and Cynewulf. That is all The Gleemen. Now we will see if they play the square.

Id: [0x002D6B86]
Make good use of your freedom then. Apologize to your friends, and stay out of trouble.

Id: [0x002D6B87]
Make good use of your freedom then. Apologize to your friends, and stay out of trouble.

Id: [0x002D6B88]
I, Cynewulf, have been freed from my bondage and am eternally in your debt.

Id: [0x002D6B8A]
A horrible old hag who wants to make me into rabbit stew! Thanks for helping me get out of here!

Id: [0x002D6B8C]
Who is this witch that locked you in?

Id: [0x002D6B8D]
Who is this witch that locked you in?

Id: [0x002D6B90]
Do not think your kindness has made you a new friend, Lord of Imbeciles. I will kill you. All of you, gorging on Aesir flesh.

Id: [0x002D6B95]
Most hours of the day, you can find him at the old villa, dealing with all manner of knavery.

Id: [0x002D6B97]
Children, they bewilder you. They can cause you so much worry, fill you with joy. Even stop your heart. And if you're lucky, they replace you.

Id: [0x002D6C91]
I would like to reorganize the crew

Id: [0x002D6C95]
I would like to see what you have in stock.

Id: [0x002D6C96]
May I see your stores?

Id: [0x002D6C97]
What have you got for me today?

Id: [0x002D6C99]
All right, bring out my lieutenant.

Id: [0x002D6C9D]
I brought something for you.

Id: [0x002D6C9E]
I have something that may interest you.

Id: [0x002D6CA1]
Can you remind me what you do here?

Id: [0x002D6CA2]
What is it you do here, again?

Id: [0x002D6CA3]
Tell me about what you do here.

Id: [0x002D6CB0]
[ONO: creepy laughter](laughing)

Id: [0x002D6CB1]
[cough]Poison! I need to get out of here.

Id: [0x002D6CB2]
[cough]Poison! I need to get out of here.

Id: [0x002D6CB5]
There's an army of the dead down here.

Id: [0x002D6CB6]
There is an army of the dead down here.

Id: [0x002D6CBA]
I'll kill you for that. Have you nothing to say?

Id: [0x002D6CBB]
I'll kill you for that. Have you anything to say?

Id: [0x002D6CC2]
I would like to reorganize the crew

May I see your stores?

Id: [0x002D6CC6]
What have you got for me today?

Id: [0x002D6CC8]
All right, bring out my lieutenant.

Id: [0x002D6CCA]
I brought something for you.

Id: [0x002D6CCB]
I have something that may interest you.

Id: [0x002D6CCD]
Can you remind me what you do here?

Id: [0x002D6CCE]
What is it you do here, again?

Id: [0x002D6CCF]
Tell me about what you do here.

Id: [0x002D6D20]
I am Thegn Tarquin. Lady Annis belongs to me!

Id: [0x002D6D21]
If you're going to hold someone against their will, it would be wise to gag them.

Id: [0x002D6D22]
If you're going to hold someone against their will, it would be wise to gag them.

Id: [0x002D6D26]
I told you to leave, Dane rat! The lady is mine!

Id: [0x002D6D27]
No more! I yield! Find another champion, lady!

Id: [0x002D6D29]
Strange…

Id: [0x002D6D2A]
Strange…

Id: [0x002D6D2D]
Help me, O Savior! Rescue me from this dastardly man!

Id: [0x002D6D2F]
It is over. You can come out now.

Id: [0x002D6D30]
It is over. You can come out now.

Id: [0x002D6D31]
O, assuredly.

Id: [0x002D6D35]
When you are ready, follow the River Nene to my settlement. We shall welcome you as a brother.

Id: [0x002D6D36]
When you are ready, follow the River Nene to my settlement. We shall welcome you as a brother.

Id: [0x002D6D3A]
Njal! No, she bleeds! [beat]Hang tough, my child. Father is here!

Id: [0x002D6D55]
Enough skulking!

Id: [0x002D6D56]
Enough skulking!

Id: [0x002D6D5A]
Rest well, my friend.

Id: [0x002D6D5B]
Rest well, my friend.

Id: [0x002D6D5D]
Aelfred spoke of Ubba meeting his end on the Afon river, west of Uffentune. I fear the worst, but I must know.

Id: [0x002D6D5E]
Aelfred spoke of Ubba meeting his end on the Afon river, west of Uffentune. I fear the worst, but I must know.

Id: [0x002D6D60]
I am nearing the Afon river at Uffentune. This was where Aelfred said the battle with Ubba took place.

Id: [0x002D6D61]
I am nearing the Afon river at Uffentune. This was where Aelfred said the battle with Ubba took place.

Id: [0x002D6D68]
With boar and mead, revels and fine company. Perhaps a game or two? Leap frog and blindman's buff!

Id: [0x002D6DB8]
I devote myself to solitary prayer, to confession and fasting.

Id: [0x002D6DBA]
I am at complete peace with the world. Can you say as much?

Id: [0x002D6DBB]
What are you doing in this dungeon?

Id: [0x002D6DBC]
What are you doing in this dungeon?

Id: [0x002D6DBD]
Sealed up here? All day and night for life? It is an odd way to worship.

Id: [0x002D6DBE]
Sealed up here? All day and night for life? It is an odd way to worship.

Id: [0x002D6DC1]
Do what you must, but return quickly. Our men are ready to move.

Id: [0x002D6DC2]
What a tale to weave into our saga. Look at us, side by side with the Ragnarssons.

Id: [0x002D6DC3]
See what you can find. I'll go back to the brothers.

Id: [0x002D6DC4]
God will sear your soul, heathen! If He can find it.

Id: [0x002D6DC5]
Eivor will handle it. Go on.

Id: [0x002D6DC6]
No … no no no! It can't be. Stay back!

Id: [0x002D6DC7]
Agh! Get me off this thing!

Id: [0x002D6DC8]
Go on then. End it.

Id: [0x002D6DC9]
Of course, of course. You know how rumors grow. A fish the size of a hand at catching is the size of a man the next morning.

Id: [0x002D6DCA]
Eivor the Pant-less, a head soaked with mead, and many pockets full of vomit.

Id: [0x002D6DCB]
Listen to this weeping old goat!

Id: [0x002D6DCC]
Go on…

Id: [0x002D6DCD]
Follow me! Into this kingdom of snow!

Id: [0x002D6DCE]
Fight me!

Id: [0x002D6DCF]
Now the real dance, here! Come fight me!

Id: [0x002D6DD1]
And hold nothing back. For here we need not fear a thing.

Id: [0x002D6DD2]
Fight me!

Id: [0x002D6DD4]
Fight upon my command!

Id: [0x002D6DD5]
Rise!

Id: [0x002D6DD6]
Will you not die?

Id: [0x002D6DD7]
I will leave you here to die! Like a rotting fruit on a dying tree!

Id: [0x002D6DD8]
I have a hefty sum of silver. Speak to the people here. If the silver will help one bring us toward peace, offer it to them.

Id: [0x002D6DD9]
I am that. Ynyr ap Cadfarch by name. Address me proper.

Id: [0x002D6DDA]
Please, don't tarry.

Id: [0x002D6DDB]
One last thing. We'll need a fyrd before our battle's done. Try to free any captives you find. They'll swell our ranks.

Id: [0x002D6DDC]
For the love of Saint Cuthbert, free me!

Id: [0x002D6DDD]
Ow! Gods, what are you doing?

Id: [0x002D6DDE]
Just … finish me.

There you are, Raven!

Id: [0x002D6DE0]
Eivor! It is good to see you.

Id: [0x002D6DE3]
Look, you Saxon bed-wetters! Here is a real warrior.

Id: [0x002D6DE5]
Camped not far to the west. A battalion of bloated, brainwashed military men. You can't miss it for the smell.

Id: [0x002D6DE7]
If it will clear Tarben's name, we will recover what is yours. Where are these soldiers?

Id: [0x002D6DE8]
If it will clear Tarben's name, we will recover what is yours. Where are these soldiers?

Id: [0x002D6DEA]
Eivor! You made it unscathed.

Id: [0x002D6DEC]
I made you what you are! My principles led to your great nudity!

Id: [0x002D6DED]
My heart is heavy.

Id: [0x002D6DF0]
Think twice, nun. I won't be dying today.

Id: [0x002D6DF1]

Consider them on your watch and sleep when in your bed. But now, report back before you are labeled a deserter. Go.

Eyvind, wake up, or you will be cast into the wild.

Id: [0x002D6DFC]
He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

Id: [0x002D6E01]
You look well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D6E03]
The wars have not ended. You have simply stopped fighting. But men are brewing plots in meadhalls and bedrooms. You will see.

Id: [0x002D6E05]
I am well. Better than I expected. In this exile, I have found a somewhat nourishing peace.

Id: [0x002D6E06]
Each morning, I am awakened by the sun and growling cormorants, I bathe in the chilly water of the marsh, I eat from shrubs and drink from buckets.

Id: [0x002D6E07]
It is a good life. Simple. Blessed.

Id: [0x002D6E0A]
I am. The wars have ended, and my settlement thrives.

Id: [0x002D6E0B]

And how are you, Aelfred? Getting used to the idea of being … unremarkable?

The barley in that silo was watered by my blood and sweat!

Finnr, welcome to our home. May you find a second wind here, one to fill your sails and send you across the world and back.

What has that bastard done to you?

Id: [0x002D6E26]
Yes. To each other

Id: [0x002D6E37]
Randvi… Saw you looking a little lonely. Thought I might come and join you.

Randvi… Saw you looking a little lonely. Thought I might come and join you.

Id: [0x002D6E39]
Thank you for opening your home to us, Eivor. We could not be happier.

Id: [0x002D6E3C]
What is happening here?

Id: [0x002D6E3D]
What is happening here?

Id: [0x002D6E40]
The only thing that never dies is the reputation of the one who's died.

Please, come with. I do not want to do this with my brother alone.

THEOTFORD REEVE

Id: [0x002D6E4A]
Agh! I cannot do it!

Id: [0x002D6E4D]
Gentle as a lamb. Stand aside.

Id: [0x002D6E4F]
What is wrong?

Id: [0x002D6E50]
The door is not opening.

Id: [0x002D6E52]
Use the key!

Id: [0x002D6E53]
Ah, yes! Err … err...  Where did I put it?

Id: [0x002D6E54]
Gods! Mother's axe! It is inside![to Eivor] Please, stranger, you must get it back for us! Find a way in!

Id: [0x002D6E57]
I am excited. You must hear it in my voice.

Id: [0x002D6E58]
I am excited. You must hear it in my voice.

Id: [0x002D6E5A]
Ugh… Dull and Duller, like I said.

Id: [0x002D6E5B]
Dull and Duller, like I said.

Id: [0x002D6E5F]
Come, if you have courage!

Id: [0x002D6E60]
The jarl needs help!

Id: [0x002D6E66]
We will. After the feast, when things have settled.

Id: [0x002D6E69]
We can speak more on this, soon.

Id: [0x002D6E6A]
We can speak more on this, soon.

Id: [0x002D6E6B]
Good, yes. I … would like that.

Id: [0x002D6E6C]
Good, yes. I-- I'd like that.

Id: [0x002D6E7F]
I'm coming, my lady. I'm here.

Id: [0x002D6E82]
This is fate. Our fate.

Id: [0x002D6E83]
What is it?

Id: [0x002D6E84]
What is it?

Id: [0x002D6E87]
You trapped them. Let them be free as animals should.

Id: [0x002D6E88]
You trapped them. Let them be free as animals should.

Id: [0x002D6E8C]
That was not a mistake. You looked like a good fighter. I was hoping you would kill or weaken Olaf so I could escape.

Id: [0x002D6E8E]
You will never see me again! I will be a white rabbit in the snow!

Id: [0x002D6E90]
Your second mistake was choosing me as your prey.

Id: [0x002D6E91]
Your second mistake was choosing me as your prey.

Id: [0x002D6E92]
You are young and still foolish, so I will spare you your life.

Id: [0x002D6E93]
You are young and still foolish, so I will spare you your life.

There was no need for this fight. Kjotve is dead by my hand. I have lifted his boot from your neck.

Id: [0x002D6E98]
There was no need for this fight. Kjotve is dead by my hand. I have lifted his boot from your neck.

Id: [0x002D6E99]
Olaf, you lifeless fool! You almost murdered our rescuer!

Id: [0x002D6E9B]
You picked the wrong fight. I am of Raven Clan and Kjotve's sworn enemy.

Id: [0x002D6E9C]
You picked the wrong fight. I am of Raven Clan and Kjotve's sworn enemy.

Id: [0x002D6E9D]
Then we share a common foe, and I was wrong to use you like that.

Id: [0x002D6EA6]
But cross me again or harm anyone I cherish, and you will join your friends in Helheim's foul forests.

Id: [0x002D6EA7]
But cross me again or harm anyone I cherish, and you will join your friends in Helheim's foul forests.

Id: [0x002D6EAE]
Do not listen to that drivel, Brother. We must endure. The world will know us by name soon enough!

Id: [0x002D6EB2]
A pestilence poisons this land.

Id: [0x002D6EB7]
But maybe you would be moved to help by the bounty King Harald has offered for any warlock killed.

Id: [0x002D6EC0]
I have to go, see you soon.

Id: [0x002D6EC1]
I must be on my way now, goodbye.

Id: [0x002D6EC2]
I’m off, be well friend.

Id: [0x002D6EC3]
I must take my leave, so long.

Id: [0x002D6EC4]
I'll see you later, friend.

Id: [0x002D718E]
Eivor, I want you to know that Sigurd and I are…

Id: [0x002D718F]
How do you feel?

Id: [0x002D7194]
I tried to save her! I made a mixture that would have burned away her illness, but he chose to drench her in pig's blood.

Id: [0x002D7195]
If there is any blame here, it lies on him and his ignorant kin. He killed his sister.

Id: [0x002D7197]
There's a hunter who believes you poisoned his sister.

Id: [0x002D7198]
There is a hunter who believes you poisoned his sister.

Id: [0x002D719C]
Thank you, thank you! Follow me!

Id: [0x002D71A1]
It's near the highest point of a hill just south of the settlement. Easy to spot, I'm sure.

Id: [0x002D71BB]
Wait here then. We will return before you sprout another pair of horns.

Id: [0x002D71BC]
God go with you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D71C0]
O ho! They have returned!

Id: [0x002D71C2]
With pleasure.

Id: [0x002D71C6]
Do you … do you mean that?

Id: [0x002D71C7]
What I had with another is over. You are the one I want.

[This line is a reuse from the Jotenheim script.]The probabilities lead us here. The calculations give us hope.

Id: [0x002D71D8]
I can hear serpents hissing behind the crates. O gods, what has my brother got me into?

Id: [0x002D71D9]
Something prevents the ladder from descending. O, I get dizzy up so high!

Id: [0x002D71DA]
O! More crates. We need to get past them.

Id: [0x002D71DB]
There! Another slithering devil waiting to get me!

Id: [0x002D71DD]
Are you sure? Well, okay then…

Id: [0x002D71DF]
O Freyja, grant me a strong grip.

Id: [0x002D71E1]
Alright, I'll come.

Id: [0x002D71E3]
I can see Frode! I'm nearly there, Brother!

Id: [0x002D71E4]
The serpents are gone. We can move ahead.

Id: [0x002D71E5]
The serpents are gone. We can move ahead.

Id: [0x002D71E6]
You can come down now.

Id: [0x002D71E7]
You can come down now.

Id: [0x002D71E8]
The way is clear.

Id: [0x002D71E9]

They are dead. Come.

Gorm's crystal-eye. It hums with a strange feeling. Unearthly.

O, stone and soil! Now he will hunt us wherever we go! You have saved us and doomed us all at once!

Id: [0x002D71FB]
I have the key, Jotun, but I am not your assassin. Be satisfied with that.

Id: [0x002D71FC]
I have the key, Jotun, but I am not your assassin. Be satisfied with that.

Id: [0x002D71FF]
It is done. The hunter is dead.

Id: [0x002D7200]
It is done. The hunter is dead.

Id: [0x002D7203]
Hurry now! Release him!

Id: [0x002D7204]
Wonderful stranger! My everlasting thanks for saving me… [catching herself]saving us.

Id: [0x002D7205]
O, you must try! He will not be long, I know it!

Id: [0x002D7209]
There's no need to die for your vengeance. Give me the key, and keep your life.

You leave me little choice. Let that faithless wench have her pretty-boy, then. Here's the key.

Id: [0x002D723E]
I don't know what to do, I have such anger in me!

Id: [0x002D723F]
Hej, good farmer.

Hej, good farmer.

Id: [0x002D7242]
Guthrum?

Id: [0x002D7243]
Guthrum?

Id: [0x002D724E]
No matter. Just let them cool and we'll begin again.

Id: [0x002D724F]
Direct me and I will obey.

Id: [0x002D7250]
O dear, o dear. Look at them. Little balls of soot.

Id: [0x002D7252]
[grunt]Yes.

Id: [0x002D7296]
We were so young… so very nimble in our hugr (minds) and our ways…

Id: [0x002D7297]
You know, there is a great meadhall nearby. We could go there and reflect on our greatest exploits.

Id: [0x002D7298]
Nothing finer than an endless night of drunken glory to make you forget all of the dishonorable fops in this world.

Id: [0x002D7299]
Just skalds and warriors full of mead and story-greed. O, yes, let me weave you a hero's saga from dirt and spittle.

Id: [0x002D729A]
This one blustery battle-day, I was inside a shield wall … and my wife entered the shield wall … nude … and started singing… O…

Id: [0x002D72A7]
Asgard? This place is truly like no other … and … this is not a dream?

Id: [0x002D72A9]
Am I supposed to fight you?

Id: [0x002D72AB]
And then the Valkyries plucked you from the Helvger, which leads lesser men to Hel, and brought you here, to glorious Asgard.

Smart, you mean. I must have taken mother's axe out of the house knowing this fool would forget it.

And left the key in its place. You two are as useful as a glass hammer. I am leaving.

At the end of the day, with a dozen fish in hand, he would drink it. Cool and refreshing. I think often of that image.

I know the feeling.

Ah, it is good to see this place again after so much time away.

Id: [0x002D72E0]
I have it! Mother's axe! It's here!

Id: [0x002D72E2]
Ugh! Thickheaded fools.

Id: [0x002D72E3]
Thickheaded fools.

Id: [0x002D72E4]
Get out of there!

Moo. (What a relief.)

Saehrimnir is as deadly as he is delicious!

Id: [0x002D7337]
It is worth risking death for the meal of your life!

A deliberate choice on their part, I think. I'm hoping these documents shed some light on that mystery.

Ah, wonderful! We have so little writing from the original Hidden Ones. This will grow our understanding immeasurably.

Id: [0x002D7362]
These documents may have been inked by the founders of the Hidden Ones, in fact. But their names are unknown to us, lost to history.

Id: [0x002D7364]
You know, the black market merchant Reda has an old piece of writing from the same era as the codex pages you found.

Id: [0x002D74B3]
A yule goat for your silver?

Id: [0x002D74B4]
Thank you, stranger, you have given me a glimpse of a sweeter life. This was hers, take it, for it saddens me to look on.

Id: [0x002D74B5]
And what of my peace? My life here is pallid and dank as a grave-shroud.

Well well, look who's returned. You ready to smack about with the finest?

Id: [0x002D74D9]
O, that old scrap? Yes, it's just a short letter from one Hidden One to another. One of my rarest artifacts.

Reda. Hytham says you have an old piece of writing from the early Hidden Ones.

A friend gave it to me, for safe keeping. Bayek was his name. Egyptian fellow. Very kind.

Id: [0x002D74DE]
Haven't seen him in a long time. A very long time.

Id: [0x002D74DF]
Anyway, the letter is written in demotic, so it may not mean much to you. But you're free to have a look.

Speak with him if you are curious to see it.

I could not say. They are written in a language I do not understand.

Id: [0x002D74E8]
A sorry necessity. We three were left homeless after your country folk, er, burned our village to ashes.

Id: [0x002D74E9]
Now we do what we must to keep body and soul together. [realizing]Here, you figured out our trick. Can you help us?

Id: [0x002D74EA]
You tried to rob me!

Id: [0x002D74EB]
You tried to rob me!

Id: [0x002D74F1]
We'll see about that! Hoof it, lads!

Id: [0x002D74F2]
I'll make you into real ghosts, you thieving scum!

It was here they kissed and separated. She traveled east, he west. They were never seen again.

Id: [0x002D7512]
O, we most certainly are that. The Three Wisps salute you, and bid you safe journey from our swamp.

Id: [0x002D7513]
Your petty schemes do not interest me. Be thankful I leave you with your lives.

Why don't you hang up some bone dolls from the branches? A man would be scared witless coming upon that in the fog.

Id: [0x002D751A]
That's a fine idea! We'll do it! Here, you deserve a few coins for your help, at least. Thanks, traveler!

Id: [0x002D7547]
You there! Dane! Come and be saved!

Id: [0x002D7548]
Can you smell brimstone? Better join us while you can, heathen!

Id: [0x002D7549]
Don't be shy! You'll feel better after you repent!

Id: [0x002D7550]
This storm is the storm that rages within us! The noble pain of those wronged in love!

Id: [0x002D7552]
I don't like your tone, Aesir. You think you're better than us, just like she did. Maybe it's time to shut your mouth.

Id: [0x002D7553]
You conjured this storm because your feelings were hurt?

Why don't you come and try?

Why don't you come and try?

Id: [0x002D755A]
O, you do mean to help me! God bless you!

Id: [0x002D755B]
Hey! What's going on? Are you all right up there?

Id: [0x002D755E]
Don't chase me! Alden's got the most silver!

Id: [0x002D7563]
So, who knows how to make a bone doll?

Id: [0x002D7564]
Can't we use twigs or something? Bones make my skin crawl.

Id: [0x002D7565]
That's the idea, idiot.

Id: [0x002D7566]
I miss the days of selling whelks down by the shore. The smell of the sea. Not like this rancid old swamp.

Id: [0x002D7567]
Chin up, Edgar! You're a wisp now! The ghost with the most! Flaunt the haunt!

Id: [0x002D757D]
My love for you rises tall and strong, like the Tree of Life!

Id: [0x002D757E]
Do not promise me a mighty branch, then let me down with a tiny twig.

Id: [0x002D757F]
Freyja's beard, it has wilted again! I cannot remain firm when you talk to me like that!

Id: [0x002D7581]
Have you come to face me finally? Or will you continue to harass me from afar?

Id: [0x002D75A5]
I think I have a clear idea of what happened here.

Skadi … O Skadi … Why are you so cold!

Id: [0x002D75BD]
O Skadi! I curse the day … you were seized with lust … for my perfect legs…

Id: [0x002D75BE]
Go back to your f-frigid mountains! The sea is my mistress!

Id: [0x002D75C0]
Eivor, there you are. I have something for you. A message … quite strange.

Id: [0x002D75C1]
A letter, requesting your presence in the southwest. A village called Athelnay.

Id: [0x002D75C3]
Nothing strange about a summons for me, is there?

Id: [0x002D75C4]

Ravensthorpe. The village of ravens.

Ravensthorpe. The village of ravens.

Id: [0x002D75CD]
Exactly. You should begin in Lunden. I have credible reports that The Order is working now to seize the city.

Id: [0x002D75CF]
And while you are there, be on the lookout for our symbol. Centuries ago, the Hidden Ones had bureaus built around England.

Id: [0x002D75D0]
There were six, I believe. If you can find them, search them well for documents bearing the same symbol. It will greatly aid my studies.

Id: [0x002D75D1]
I will speak with Randvi about this.

Id: [0x002D75E2]
It is not the recipient I find strange. It is the sender. The letter is signed, A Poor-Fellow Soldier of Christ.

Id: [0x002D75E4]
For a short time, I hoped it might be Basim feeding us the names of these targets. He seemed the most likely man for a time.

Id: [0x002D75E8]
Something for me? What is it?

Id: [0x002D75E9]
Something for me? What is it?

Id: [0x002D75EA]
Ah. Our mysterious partner.

Only one way to discover the truth. Thank you, Hytham. I will take care of this.

Only one way to discover the truth. Thank you, Hytham. I will take care of this.

Id: [0x002D75F1]
King Aelfred? Did our Poor Fellow-Soldier lead you to his hiding place?

Id: [0x002D75F3]
He turned on his own Order? Fascinating.

Id: [0x002D75F6]
Wonderful. With his abdication, the last stronghold of The Order has been dismantled. All that remain are scraps, here and there.

Id: [0x002D75F9]
He did, for they were one and the same. Our Poor-Fellow Soldier of Christ was the Grand Maegester of The Order of the Ancients.

Not turned so much as trampled. His devotion to Christ and what he calls a Universal Order set him against them from the start.

Are you ever unhappy, Alden?

Ill raise a cup to that.

Ill raise a cup to that.

Aye? Did you have more to say?

I have thought of your sad tale. It moved me.

Go, Moccus. Our families would never approve the union, and if you're to have any reputation, you will forget me.

Id: [0x002D7663]
Yes, they have. But I hope that has changed, thanks to your intervention … even if it was … drastic. Thank you.

You came back!

Id: [0x002D767B]
I … I did not mean to deceive you so … come sit, drink and I will tell you my story.

You are no woman, so why do you speak like one? Is this a trick?

That's mine! I swindled hard for that! Give it here.

Id: [0x002D76A2]
And you, Eivor. Now that you have seen our enemy and you understand our cause, I wonder if you would join us? Become a Hidden One.

Id: [0x002D76A5]
I understand you well, Eivor. Very well indeed.

Id: [0x002D76A6]
Was this your ultimate goal, Hytham? A trial by fire? It is a kind offer, but I do not believe we fight for quite the same cause.

I see. Lead on.

Id: [0x002D76B6]
I see. Lead on.

O, God! The smell. I can't![scream]

Id: [0x002D76BB]
Ah! Done good, lads. Scared those wenches right off. Won't be seeing them around anymore.

Id: [0x002D76D1]
Perhaps I should shelve this elixir for the time being. At least until I can better understand its effects.

Id: [0x002D76D2]
One of your customers on the same pursuit, I think. Only he was not so lucky.

Id: [0x002D76D3]

You better hurry.

Dark times, dark times! You tend to your sheep, to your cattle, and look away from the knaves that creep ever closer!

East Anglia still stands without a king but for how long? Who will defend us in the battles to come?

Raise your voices and your mugs tonight at the Spanking Pig. For those mugs may be your last.

Id: [0x002D771E]
Slow down. Something is … not quite right here.

That should be the last of these pig-faced cowards. Oswald will be relieved to know of this.

Id: [0x002D7726]
Eivor! You came. Dinner will still be served, but I am afraid you are too early. My intended and her family are not ready.

Id: [0x002D772D]
Her name is Valdis. And people don't marry for love these days, Eivor. This is an arrangement for East Anglia's benefit.

Id: [0x002D772E]
She is from a Dane family whose military might is not to be trifled with. But her brothers … their motives are selfish.

Id: [0x002D7731]
Why don't you have a look around and come back later? Dinner will not disappoint.

Id: [0x002D7735]
Have a walk by the countryside to work up an appetite.

Id: [0x002D7736]
Travelers sometimes leave offerings at Cedd's Stone, a beautiful altar in the woods just east of here.

Oswald, where is this dinner you promised me?

Id: [0x002D7739]

Id: [0x002D7745]
Clear the mess in the longhouse. And wake my brothers with the coldest water you can find.

Id: [0x002D7748]
Eivor, good to see you.

Id: [0x002D774E]
I am not his. This marriage is to be an alliance. Nothing more.

Id: [0x002D774F]
Besides, the man can barely carry a sword or speak with conviction.

Id: [0x002D7752]
I will leave you to your day. You can find Oswald by the docks. Watching the river calms him, apparently.

Id: [0x002D7754]
You are Oswald's powerful bride-to-be, Valdis.

Id: [0x002D7755]

You made it. Now tussle with care, and go easy on our future king. He is the only man left who can claim the crown.

Kings are made, not born, Finnr. So let us see what we can make of Oswald.

I hope your faith in pig farmers is not misplaced, Eivor.

There is work to do, yes. But we will rise to meet Rued's clan. God will make certain of it.

You fight well, Oswald! Does the threat of death drive your blade further?

We spotted this one on a boat. If there are others, they might be by the river.

Id: [0x002D7779]
Look for anyone suspicious outside the city walls.

Id: [0x002D777C]
Rued's scouts would be camped near their boats outside the city walls. One of them will talk.

You are awfully well armed for a pig farmer.

Put me down! I tell you, I'm a cow farmer! Let me go, Dane!

It … it is not beyond reason. I tend to many livestock!

Id: [0x002D7794]
Is it true that Rued wants that whore Valdis back?

Id: [0x002D7795]
You watch your mouth. I would like to see you call her that when she's back. Remember Frode?

Id: [0x002D7796]
Aye, she had him flogged and laid bare in the square for disrespecting her.

Id: [0x002D7797]
Then shut your mouth before you get us both flogged.

Id: [0x002D779B]
Oswald is dead! Oswald is dead! We mourn the loss of our future king and hope for East Anglia!

Id: [0x002D77A6]
We will remember his brave fight in Dunwic. We will remember his sword against Rued's.

Id: [0x002D77A7]
And above all we shall remember the man's devotion to God and his mission.

Id: [0x002D77A8]
Raise your mugs to Oswald tonight at the Spanking Pig! That is what the man would have wanted!

They are meaningless because He loves me. Go ahead and burn my house, destroy my belongings, I will never get angry.

It's been quite a while since I've seen your face around here!

If I taught you our creed, if you spent time with it … it could open your mind to another view.

There were six, I believe. If you can find them, search them well for documents bearing the same symbol. It will greatly aid my studies.

O, surely. We will share the Lord's work with ye. The iron tinge, you will taste it. We all have earned it after fasting.

Id: [0x002D80C3]
Yes. We show our devotion. Remove distraction. But now, we give in to the fruits of our Creator's Work.

It is the only way to piously reap the reward of our Holy Father. Praise be to Him.

We will prostrate ourselves for Guthlac at the end of this glorious pilgrimage. Drown in His reward.

O, Brother Holthwulf, and you've made a friend as well. Good to have you back!

"I can do all things through Him who strengthens me." We Christians take matters into our own hands well enough.

Id: [0x002D815A]
That is far enough. Sisters, gather around. Let us pray to the Lord our God, and thank him for watching over us.

We kicked Winchell out for good reason, naked all the time, unacceptable. Forget about him.

Yes, from shore to shore. My brothers and I came upon this unclaimed land some months ago and found it suited to our ambitions.

That's the last time I go chasing rabbits. Especially white ones. Now, just a little rest, and I'll be ready for more adventures!

You! Serf! Bring me ale!

Id: [0x002D8DE5]
We have work to do. Starting in the cities of England.

Id: [0x002D8DE6]
Lunden, Jorvik, Wincestre … all three are infested by members of the same order to which Kjotve belonged.

Id: [0x002D8DE7]
But their reach extends much further than this. Of all the lands on earth, I believe England is the most overrun.

Id: [0x002D8DE9]
Not just turmoil. They spread a plague of delusion, teaching men and women to abase and abuse themselves in exchange for power.

Id: [0x002D8DEB]
Of course. This is the sole purpose of the Hidden Ones. To liberate the body and spirit of man from any unnatural shackles.

Id: [0x002D8DEC]
But we have not operated in England for over four centuries. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, the Hidden Ones have not had a presence here.

Id: [0x002D8DED]
This absence has given The Order of the Ancients ample room to grow and thrive. Our task will not be an easy one.

Id: [0x002D9301]
Are you any good? I'd like to find out.

Id: [0x002D9307]
What say you! A quick rattling of bones to kill some time?

Id: [0x002D9308]
Orlog, indeed. Let us have a game then.

Id: [0x002D930F]
Let the best player win!

I will not go easy on you!

Come back again. I shall beat you one day.

Did not expect you to shy from a challenge! Things are never as they seem.

My, my! It has been a while since I met a worthy opponent. Another round!

You got me! Shall we go again?

Well played, stranger. Another round?

There, there. The bones are a fickle friend. Let's go again!

I just got lucky there, stranger. Things might not go so smoothly again. Let us continue.

Id: [0x002D9343]
[laughing]Come on, you're not going to leave it at that, right? Let's go again!

Very well, then! Let us start!

You just made my day, stranger! Let's have at it.

Excellent! Let us not tarry.

Bah! Bugger off, then, Dane.

You sure? Victory could very well be yours![laughing]

Oof! You are pretty good! Shall we go again?

No! I played perfectly! Another round?

Don't be too hard on yourself. Orlog is a whimsical game. Let's go again!

Aw, are you going to run away now? Surely not. Another round perhaps?

Who would like to hear a story?

Id: [0x002D9629]
Who would enjoy a tale of the gods?

Id: [0x002D962B]
There has always been war, even among the gods. When Midgard was young, Asgard was torn by strife.

Id: [0x002D962C]
The battle-born Aesir, hating the Vanir's magic, betrayed custom and made murder in Odin's great hall.

Id: [0x002D962D]
Gullveig of the Vanir was killed and burned - not once, but three times! And reborn as Freyja, Mother of the Volur.

Id: [0x002D962E]
The war that came after echoes through the nine worlds still. Midgard would drown in the blood spilt, and their dead would hide the sun.

Id: [0x002D962F]
Those bravely fallen, now buried, wait for Heimdall to blow the Gjallarhorn and summon them to battle, one last time.

Id: [0x002D9630]
Losses on both sides left each open to attacks from Jotnar and other monsters. So, Odin, in his wisdom, proposed a truce and marriage to the War-Witch, Freyja.

Id: [0x002D9631]
Oaths were made, horns were raised, and from the gods' mingled spit was born, fully-formed, Kvasmir, wiser than Odin himself.

Id: [0x002D9632]
This was the same Kvasmir whose stolen blood became the Mead of Poetry, but that is another story.

Id: [0x002D963F]
A wise skald takes his words from the gods … and his orders from the king.

Id: [0x002D9641]
A good story, Holger, but I hear the voice of Styrbjorn in it.

Id: [0x002D9642]

There are more at the river!

There are more at the river!

Id: [0x002D984F]
Ivarr gone. Sciropescire an ally. I should confer with Randvi.

Id: [0x002D9850]

Id: [0x002D9855]
Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002D9856]
Ceolbert?

Id: [0x002D9863]
Then we create a distraction before we leave. Burn this village to the ground.

Id: [0x002D9865]
Aelfred set a trap for me last I saw him.

Id: [0x002D9866]
Aelfred set a trap for me last I saw him.

Ah!

No drink in your fist?

Id: [0x002D9935]
Come on.

Id: [0x002D9936]
I'll find you something.

Id: [0x002D9937]
I'll pass it on.

Id: [0x002D9938]
But you're not getting any mead!

Id: [0x002D993C]
There is the seed, in the mountain's rocky grip. Some heat may free it from its shell.

They're asking for it.

Eivor! I'm bored to death here.

Id: [0x002D9987]
I'm waiting.

Id: [0x002D9988]
Watch out!

Id: [0x002D9989]
You're not so smart.

Id: [0x002D998A]
You're a tricky one, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D998B]
Come on, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D998C]
Bleed! Like Ceolbert.

Danes did not do this! It's the Devil's work!

Id: [0x002D99F0]
Yee-ahhh!

Id: [0x002D99F3]
Should be up there in the trees ahead. Can you smell it? It stinks of death and evil.

Id: [0x002D99F5]
I know that scent well. Carrion and death. Loki's reek.

Id: [0x002D9A4C]
Gorm is in these woods somewhere.

Id: [0x002D9A4D]
Gorm is in these woods somewhere.

Id: [0x002D9A4F]
I will find you, Gorm. No matter how long it takes.

Id: [0x002D9A50]
I will find you, Gorm. No matter how long it takes.

Id: [0x002D9A54]
Where are you hiding, Gorm?

Id: [0x002D9A55]
Where are you hiding, Gorm?

Id: [0x002D9A5B]
Gorm's storehouse. A good place to start.

Id: [0x002D9A5C]
Gorm's storehouse. A good place to start.

Id: [0x002D9A60]
Trading? Who could this Olav trade with here?

Id: [0x002D9A61]
Trading? Who could this Olav trade with here?

Id: [0x002D9A65]
This Olav was trading with locals. Good to know there are other folk around.

Id: [0x002D9A66]
This Olav was trading with locals. Good to know there are other folk around.

Id: [0x002D9A6A]
This Olav cannot bear any loyalty to Gorm. Could be he will aid me.

Id: [0x002D9A6B]
This Olav cannot bear any loyalty to Gorm. Could be he will aid me.

Id: [0x002D9A6F]
Finding Olav may be the key to finding Gorm. Or at least, a helpful ally.

Id: [0x002D9A70]
Finding Olav may be the key to finding Gorm. Or at least, a helpful ally.

Id: [0x002D9AC1]
How can I face Halfdan Jarl now? I've failed him again.

Id: [0x002D9AF2]
Not you, Dane. Now go, before that changes.

Id: [0x002D9AF3]
Right. Talkers they are, Ubba and Sigurd. Might want to dig the wax from your ears.

Id: [0x002D9AF4]
Your lies are just like you, Eivor. Big and bold.

Id: [0x002D9AF5]
Good timing. We would have stormed the place without you.

Id: [0x002D9AF6]
Did you see Ubba and Sigurd in Templebrough?

Id: [0x002D9AF7]
You and Sigurd … you always see eye to eye?

Id: [0x002D9AF8]
You are still young. You live to my age, and you will see. The closer you get, the greater the stink that rises.

Id: [0x002D9AF9]
No, you are here to make your mark. I know what it means to be a young drengr (courageous warrior). You think of glory and destiny.

Id: [0x002D9AFA]
I know your type, Wolf-Kissed. But me, I am not looking as far into the future as you.

Id: [0x002D9AFB]
Will you not stay, Wolf-Kissed? There is no king, but we have corpses to loot!

Id: [0x002D9AFC]
You go where you like. I am not quite finished here.

Id: [0x002D9AFD]
Eivor … Your Ladyship … do not mind me. Only here to count my spoils.

Id: [0x002D9AFE]
All right, all right. But if you mean to stay, mind the smell after they finish this.

Id: [0x002D9AFF]
Take your horse and make the king sit atop his crown when he rides back. It will keep him awake and lively.

Id: [0x002D9B00]
You have drawn a dark conclusion about me, haven't you? That is all well and good. I've drawn some about you as well.

Id: [0x002D9B01]
I know I have been a cock. But you are a good fighter, I respect that. Let it be said that Ivarr the Boneless considers Eivor a friend.

Id: [0x002D9B02]
Not 'til I know more. Linger here a while if you can. Strengthen our friendships. I will send for you soon enough.

Id: [0x002D9B03]
See that? Sly bastard, trying to win your heart. Well, two can play at that game.

Id: [0x002D9B04]
Not entirely, old friend. I also said you were a bringer of good omens, which proved to be true.

Id: [0x002D9B05]
In spite of these war-cries, you should know that Vili's father is more frail than last you saw him.

Id: [0x002D9B06]
So he is. And he'll be pleased as Skoll with the moon in his jaws at the sight of you.

Id: [0x002D9B07]
You bring good luck with you. We could guide the sail-steeds downstream.

Id: [0x002D9B08]
Eivor, the Raven Clan's Wolf-Kissed … you'll soon have more names than the All-Father himself.

Id: [0x002D9B0A]
I have orders to go to Stoneburgh, but our camp is just ahead, so hurry on without me. Vili and Hemming Jarl will be pleased to see you.

Id: [0x002D9B0B]
You see what I deal with, Eivor? The mind of a troll in the body of an Aesir.

Id: [0x002D9B0C]
Hemming Jarl has confided in you? About his health?

Id: [0x002D9B0D]
You are a true gift, Eivor. Thank you.

Id: [0x002D9B0E]
They mourn. It is to be expected. Still, thank you.

Id: [0x002D9B0F]
I will stay. You have wisdom, Eivor. More than I could have guessed.

Id: [0x002D9B10]
Hjorr… I know him. Are you a friend?

Id: [0x002D9B11]
Then you will get no help from me or any of the other merchants for that matter. Now if you don't mind.

Id: [0x002D9B12]
You'll want to speak to the dockmaster, Grigorii. I've seen him talking with her before.

Id: [0x002D9B13]
As I just explained to your friend there, if your wares have been seized, take it up with the council.

Id: [0x002D9B14]
You know Hjorr and Ljufvina? What business do you have with them?

Id: [0x002D9B15]
You may be glad to hear they fare quite well in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002D9B16]
Eivor? What… Who sent you? Are you with them?

Id: [0x002D9B17]
Are you? You show up here, like this… These people tried to kill me!

Id: [0x002D9B18]
I am sorry, Eivor. I did not mean to doubt you. It has been a tense few weeks.

Id: [0x002D9B19]
You know him…?

Id: [0x002D9B1A]
At the royal hall. I will take you there.

Id: [0x002D9B1B]
I think it is safe now. Gods, Eivor, your arrival could not be better timed.

Id: [0x002D9B1C]
You mean the council? Hjorr is on the council.

Id: [0x002D9B1D]
Eivor! We heard you and Sigurd had settled in England!

Id: [0x002D9B1E]
It pleases me to see you, old friend. All are welcome here in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002D9B1F]
What are you doing here? You have not come all this way for the Yuletide.

Id: [0x002D9B20]
Listen to him, Hjorr. He has dealt with their kind before.

Id: [0x002D9B21]
Well, Eivor of the Raven Clan, as you can see, I'm in the middle of something.

Id: [0x002D9B22]
And what is your stake in this? Are you some sort of wandering mercenary?

Id: [0x002D9B23]
No, this is Sigurd Jarl's drengr (courageous warrior). Took our old camp by the river Nene as I hear it.

Id: [0x002D9B24]
What do you want?

Id: [0x002D9B25]
And they are growing, as you said.

Id: [0x002D9B26]
Do what you can. But do it quietly. I do not want the public alarmed.

Id: [0x002D9B27]
Come, I will take you back to Ljufvina. She will know where to begin.

Id: [0x002D9B28]
I cannot tell if that went the way you had hoped.

Id: [0x002D9B29]
I would swallow a horse heart to join you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9B2A]
I heard what happened at the minster and the markets. The dockmaster, the abbess, both killed. Was that you?

Id: [0x002D9B2B]
This is getting out of hand! I hope you have the final name.

Id: [0x002D9B2C]
Eivor, isn't it? What brings you to our archives?

Id: [0x002D9B2D]
Forgive me, Eivor, but as an outsider, I do not understand your stake in this. For that, I am reluctant to trust you.

Id: [0x002D9B2E]
Just who do you think you are, trespassing like this! This is my property you've destroyed!

Id: [0x002D9B2F]
Wh-what do you want from me?

Id: [0x002D9B30]
Wh-what do you mean to do with him?

Id: [0x002D9B31]
We will complete our work! You cannot stop us!

Id: [0x002D9B32]
Keep walking. You have no business here.

Id: [0x002D9B33]
I have nothing left to trade, but Coppergate market is the right place. Ask around, you'll find someone who will bend an ear.

Id: [0x002D9B34]
Keep it down, would you? You'll get yourself killed, flaunting like that, especially around here!

Id: [0x002D9B35]
You want to let go of your silver? Try the narrow alleys. Now begone.

Id: [0x002D9B36]
You will want to speak to Grigorii.

Id: [0x002D9B37]
Sorry, who are you?

Id: [0x002D9B38]
I don't know your face, and I've said too much already. Please go.

Id: [0x002D9B39]
Heavy with silver, are you?

Id: [0x002D9B3A]
Did I hear you talking about silver?

Id: [0x002D9B3B]
Oi! I'm no beggar, you dolt. I'm with the big dogs.

Id: [0x002D9B3C]
You have something he wants. If you truly want to make a trade, head to the statue near the east gate.

Id: [0x002D9B3D]
I will eat your eyes and make soup of your bones!

Id: [0x002D9B3E]
You! You don't belong down here.

Id: [0x002D9B3F]
You have it all wrong.

Id: [0x002D9B41]
The fabric of this world has been used up, torn, shredded, you see. Someone must be there to stitch it back together.

Id: [0x002D9B42]
[laugh]Yes, well, we all have our weaknesses. Yours appears to be the iron between us.

Id: [0x002D9B43]
You're right. Perhaps I deserve this death. But I am but one cog in a large wheel. One that still turns unhindered.

Id: [0x002D9B44]
It is likely the wine for the Yuletide feast. Do you think one of the council means to kill someone?

Id: [0x002D9B45]
You're right. The Roman amphitheater. Let us go.

Id: [0x002D9B46]
I heard you. Just … grant me one thing. Confer with me before you make your move.

Id: [0x002D9B47]
There you are. I was beginning to worry.

Id: [0x002D9B48]
You are certain?

Id: [0x002D9B49]
Of course. What do you need me to do?

Id: [0x002D9B4A]
I can't be seen doing that. You'll have to find another way.

Id: [0x002D9B4B]
Ah, drengr! If it's to join arms with me, the answer is yes. We can use someone like you against the Picts.

Id: [0x002D9B4C]
[laugh]That is putting it lightly! Look at it. I could not have asked for a better turnout.

Id: [0x002D9B4D]
But when it arrives, do help yourself.

Id: [0x002D9B4E]
Ah. Come to join in the feast, have you?

Id: [0x002D9B4F]
Eivor. Have you uncovered who The Vault is?

Id: [0x002D9B50]
We need to find The Vault. Have you any idea who it is?

Id: [0x002D9B51]
Who is it you suspect?

Id: [0x002D9B52]
Yes … yes you're right. And the wine?

Id: [0x002D9B53]
Eivor … you are wrong. Held back by your primitive cosmology.

Id: [0x002D9B54]
And you, Eivor. You were after these conspirators from the moment you arrived?

Id: [0x002D9B55]
But you stopped that from happening. We owe you a debt of gratitude. You can be sure Halfdan Jarl will hear of this.

Id: [0x002D9B56]
If the threat is gone, then you have my gratitude as well. I'm alive today, and so are many others because of you.

Id: [0x002D9B57]
I'd like to name you an honorary High Reeve of Jorvik, Eivor. Would you accept?

Id: [0x002D9B58]
You have earned it.

Id: [0x002D9B59]
What do you propose we do with it?

Id: [0x002D9B5A]
Let it be said that I do wish you had more trust in me. But no. There are no ill feelings here.

Id: [0x002D9B5B]
You did what you had to do. If it were me, I do not know that I could have been as levelheaded.

Id: [0x002D9B5C]
You remain a friend, Eivor. Let that be clear.

Id: [0x002D9B5D]
I could muster a few complaints about the king and the treasury, but I shall forbear. You did it, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9B5E]
Should you ever need us, we will come.

Id: [0x002D9B5F]
And I will be ready when you need me.

Id: [0x002D9B60]
Norway is your home, but not necessarily your destiny. You need to separate the two before you see clearly.

Id: [0x002D9B61]
You were filled with vengeance for so long it has left you hollow. And now, you seek to fill it with loyalty to Sigurd.

Id: [0x002D9B62]
No, but it is not enough for you. There is a hunger within you that will consume everyone around you if you are not careful.

Id: [0x002D9B63]
You return! Would you like to try again?

Id: [0x002D9B64]
I believe in you.

Id: [0x002D9B65]
So be careful in choosing the words that you say…

Id: [0x002D9B66]
Interesting … you have the cadence correct. But you failed the rhyme.

Id: [0x002D9B67]
In flyting, you'll need to be cutting and keen.

Id: [0x002D9B68]
If I tell you you're foolish, and stupid, and dull…

Id: [0x002D9B69]
Ehh! A good response! I called you stupid and you turned it around. Flyting about wit, you matched my meaning.

Id: [0x002D9B6A]
When you think of too many perfect retorts, use the one that best matches the meaning.

Id: [0x002D9B6B]
So go then, and conquer the world with your wit!

Id: [0x002D9B6C]
Go be clever, be quick, show your spirit and grit!

Id: [0x002D9B6D]
I look eagerly forward to seeing how you fare…

Id: [0x002D9B6E]
A good rhyme, but a bad structure. Close. You're close.

Id: [0x002D9B6F]
Perfect, yes! You could destroy me with such a line!

Id: [0x002D9B70]
I haven't taught you enough if you think that line works! Where's the rhyme?

Id: [0x002D9B71]
Your flyting's astounding, you're worthy of praise!

Id: [0x002D9B72]
You swing a fine axe, and you turn a good phrase!

Id: [0x002D9B73]
There's still much for you to learn about flyting, but I'm confident you'll pick it up.

Id: [0x002D9B74]
Happy to help you learn if you'd like to come back again.

Id: [0x002D9B75]
Not bad. Not bad. The rhyme is there, the sound is good, but … consider that I said you were silly, and you told me you would kill me.

Id: [0x002D9B76]
Well fought, Wolf-Kissed! Even if your wits were somewhat rattled.

Id: [0x002D9B77]
You do not need to tell us twice!

Id: [0x002D9B78]
Huh? How did you escape?

Id: [0x002D9B79]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x002D9B7A]
Where are you running to?

Id: [0x002D9B7B]
I do! Slipped away in the sword-clash. And what of you?

Id: [0x002D9B7C]
You glory hound! You would take the rescue for yourself, so the victory song is written about you?

Id: [0x002D9B7D]
No, no, I will take the beach. A far more dangerous path. You search the longhouse for our crew.

Id: [0x002D9B7E]
O, and here … this corpse will not have need of it.

Id: [0x002D9B7F]
You trail me like a lovesick lad! Go save our crew!

Id: [0x002D9B80]
You should be on a slaves-ship to Ireland, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002D9B81]
But if you wish to be my first sacrifice, Odin will be more than happy to receive you.

Id: [0x002D9B82]
I will sell you to Hel herself!

Id: [0x002D9B83]
Kneel, Wolf-Kissed, and I will spare your life!

Id: [0x002D9B84]
Die, you sack of shit!

Id: [0x002D9B85]
Eivor! Are you bewitched? Unbind us!

Id: [0x002D9B86]
Rather silent, Eivor. Anything to say for the mess you led us to?

Id: [0x002D9B87]
And what will you tell our king about this misadventure?

Id: [0x002D9B88]
Will you mention the part where you lost your crew and were nearly sold as a thrall? Will that be part of your saga?

Id: [0x002D9B89]
Your hatred for that man burns bright, Wolf-Kissed! I could warm my balls on it.

Id: [0x002D9B8A]
Just take care, Eivor. Such hatred can make you careless.

Id: [0x002D9B8B]
What he did to your father, he did to all of us. You are not in this fight alone.

Id: [0x002D9B8C]
King Styrbjorn will scold you for setting out against his wishes.

Id: [0x002D9B8D]
Is that not something you worry over?

Id: [0x002D9B8E]
There you go again, putting feeling into words that none here can match.

Id: [0x002D9B8F]
We thought we had lost you, Eivor. For good this time.

Id: [0x002D9B90]
You look like reddened shit. What happened?

Id: [0x002D9B91]
Well enough. Though I have spent many tiresome days calming the rages of our king. He is not happy with you.

Id: [0x002D9B92]
Sigurd will not save you from his father's wrath, Eivor. You should know that by now.

Id: [0x002D9B93]
Ah! After so many years. You should take it to Gunnar. He will give it back its edge.

Id: [0x002D9B94]
A cloud hangs over you. Is something wrong?

Id: [0x002D9B95]
Take your time getting settled. I will see you at the longhouse.

Id: [0x002D9B96]
I think you have lost your edge, Eivor, just like that axe. Maybe Gunnar can help you with both.

Id: [0x002D9B97]
Eivor! Did you bring us any treasure?

Id: [0x002D9B98]
That doesn't count! You need silver! And jewels!

Id: [0x002D9B99]
Eivor. Looking rough, you are. Welcome home.

Id: [0x002D9B9A]
Eivor, come to keep your blades sharp?

Id: [0x002D9B9B]
Thunderclap of Thor! Is that your father's axe? I have not seen this beauty since … well, for some time.

Id: [0x002D9B9C]
The Fates have willed it so! But in future, bring your own metal ingots. I cannot forge them from empty air.

Id: [0x002D9B9D]
Ja, work is good and my spirits are strong, but my nights are newly cold. My lady left me, if you had not heard.

Id: [0x002D9B9E]
If you have any other business, it may be wise to do it now. Let him cool down.

Id: [0x002D9B9F]
The king is not going anywhere.

Id: [0x002D9BA0]
Eivor, come forward. And explain in plain words why you have willfully disobeyed my commands. Do you mock me?

Id: [0x002D9BA1]
You know nothing of my judgment. You know nothing of my plans and strategies.

Id: [0x002D9BA2]
My son might agree with you, but he would obey me. He knows his place.

Id: [0x002D9BA3]
Imagine you are harassed by an enemy with warriors that vastly outnumber your own. What profit does open war bring?

Id: [0x002D9BA4]
Your confidence blinds you to so much in plain sight, Eivor. Day and night I toil to forge ties with clans to the north.

Id: [0x002D9BA5]
Very soon you will see the fruits of my efforts. Only then will you understand.

Id: [0x002D9BA6]
Are you so blinded by vengeance that you cannot see beyond your nose?

Id: [0x002D9BA7]
I'm at a loss with you, Eivor. When I took you in as my own, never did I imagine such disrespect from the child of Varin.

Id: [0x002D9BA8]
Your father was a fine man. Just and loyal to me. He died bravely so that we might live.

Id: [0x002D9BA9]
Why do you carry such a useless burden? Let it go. Think only of the days to come. Of your future, and the victories at hand.

Id: [0x002D9BAA]
I refuse to pick at that wound again. But if there is something that can chase these shadows from your thoughts--

Id: [0x002D9BAB]
Eivor, it has been some time. What brings you so far to see me?

Id: [0x002D9BAC]
Her mind is a jumble. She speaks to spirits. I fear her final winter has come. But she has me. Now let us speak to your needs.

Id: [0x002D9BAE]
Ah! The High One! He calls to you. Perhaps he means to speak with you. Deliver a message.

Id: [0x002D9BAF]
Only through seidr will you see more clearly and unravel the threads that sit tangled upon your mind.

Id: [0x002D9BB0]
This will not take long.

Id: [0x002D9BB1]
An elixir to loosen your hugr (mind) and unwind your thoughts. You will enter a waking sleep and journey to the world of dreams.

Id: [0x002D9BB2]
It may confuse or disorient you. But you must take note of all you see.

Id: [0x002D9BB3]
…if you seek true understanding.

Id: [0x002D9BB5]
This was not for you, Havi.

Id: [0x002D9BB6]
Hm. Not watching. They were showing you the way forward. Your life. Your path. What lies before you, and where it ends.

Id: [0x002D9BB7]
You are the Wolf-Kissed, fated to carry its mark for life. In this case, it might represent your ambition … or your fear.

Id: [0x002D9BB8]
Shades of Valhalla. For which you are destined.

Id: [0x002D9BB9]
Did you reach the summit of this mountain?

Id: [0x002D9BBA]
The gods favor you, Eivor. They always have. You will have your glory, and you will earn your place in Valhalla.

Id: [0x002D9BBB]
You will betray your brother, Sigurd. That is the meaning of your vision.

Id: [0x002D9BBC]
The Nornir have spoken, and this is their message.

Id: [0x002D9BBD]
Today that changes. I promise you.

Id: [0x002D9BBE]
And you, Eivor. Come! I have something special for you.

Id: [0x002D9BBF]
I do. But it will fall to you and Sigurd to accept it. And I must have your word that you will.

Id: [0x002D9BC0]
Eivor. Have you paid a visit to Valka?

Id: [0x002D9BC1]
Hmph. When he crawls into bed to warm me, as you say, it will be with farts and honeyed breath.

Id: [0x002D9BC2]
Yes, and you are Eivor?

Id: [0x002D9BC3]
Ah. Thank you for the warning. It will not be a problem.

Id: [0x002D9BC4]
You have a good memory.

Id: [0x002D9BC5]
Sigurd spoke often of you on our journey. Called you his right arm, a celebrated warrior. I am honored to meet you.

Id: [0x002D9BC6]
I will not bore you with the details of our meeting, but I liked your brother from the first.

Id: [0x002D9BC7]
I thought long and hard on a gift worthy of you.

Id: [0x002D9BC8]
Yes! You are stuck with me, drengr. Now drink!

Id: [0x002D9BC9]
[laugh]Gods, you should have let me start!

Id: [0x002D9BCA]
This brings us to your gift.

Id: [0x002D9BCB]
…I gift one of these secrets to you. A weapon, for the finest warrior I know.

Id: [0x002D9BCC]
A good start, Eivor. But you must learn how to use it effectively.

Id: [0x002D9BCD]
This way. Your gift awaits.

Id: [0x002D9BCE]
In time, you may learn more. But not here, where the walls and trees may have ears.

Id: [0x002D9BCF]
Here, let me lead you through our most basic techniques.

Id: [0x002D9BD0]
Then why offer him the blade? Surely we have more--

Id: [0x002D9BD1]
Use your surroundings when possible. Strike from that haystack, for instance.

Id: [0x002D9BD2]
You wield the blade well.

Id: [0x002D9BD3]
What do you make of my new friends?

Id: [0x002D9BD4]
I know what you mean. And they have learning too. They wield numbers and writing as if it were magic.

Id: [0x002D9BD5]
Basim has shown me so much about the world. All of which I will share with you … when the time is right.

Id: [0x002D9BD6]
You flatter me, Wolf-Kissed. Keep it up.

Id: [0x002D9BD7]
Do not lead my son into the same storm that follows you.

Id: [0x002D9BD9]
You know these isles best, Wolf-Kissed. Lead us to victory.

Id: [0x002D9BDA]
O, Eivor, I missed having you at my side. How I wish I could have taken you along on my travels.

Id: [0x002D9BDD]
Your trust in me will be repaid.

Id: [0x002D9BDE]
You captain our longship, Eivor. Meet us there and we will claim Kjotve's head for the gods.

Id: [0x002D9BDF]
You will have it, Eivor. You deserve it.

Id: [0x002D9BE0]
Sigurd would not let you ride on the big boat, huh?

Id: [0x002D9BE1]
What do you think of Sigurd's foreign friends? These … shadow warriors?

Id: [0x002D9BE2]
Eivor, you missed the opening act. Kjotve's forward camp melted like a spring thaw at our approach.

Id: [0x002D9BE3]
Is … is this what you want?

Id: [0x002D9BE4]
Are you prepared to embrace your destiny, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D9BE5]
We set sail when you are ready.

Id: [0x002D9BE6]
You find it strange because you are wrong.

Id: [0x002D9BE7]
You shall have your revenge at last, Eivor! We sail forward into the fire!

Id: [0x002D9BE8]
Yes, And by the gods, let Odin be watching you this night!

Id: [0x002D9BE9]
I will make you beg as your father begged, Wolf-Kissed! Squeal as your mother squealed!

Id: [0x002D9BEA]
You are weak like your father was weak.

Id: [0x002D9BEB]
Your flesh will feed my wolves.

Id: [0x002D9BEC]
I will put you down as I did your father.

Id: [0x002D9BED]
Why do you refuse to die?

Id: [0x002D9BEE]
You dance better than you fight.

Id: [0x002D9BEF]
Come. Embrace your destiny.

Id: [0x002D9BF0]
You cannot avoid your death.

Id: [0x002D9BF1]
A shameful trick, Wolf-Kissed. You are your father's child.

Id: [0x002D9BF2]
This is not your day to die.

Id: [0x002D9BF3]
You have won your prize, Wolf-Kissed. The glory of my death.

Id: [0x002D9BF4]
…your coward father and his empty sacrifice.

Id: [0x002D9BF5]
A blind pursuit of vengeance has made you predictable.

Id: [0x002D9BF6]
And you will leave this place as ashes on the wind.

Id: [0x002D9BF7]
Eivor, stop. And listen. You have reclaimed your honor. Enjoy the night's victory, tomorrow we will celebrate.

Id: [0x002D9BF8]
You have just won your heart's desire, Eivor. Yet by the look on your face, you have lost your will to live.

Id: [0x002D9BF9]
He will heal, but never fully recover. It is fortunate that you were able to succeed where he failed.

Id: [0x002D9BFA]
When you slew Kjotve, did you see a sigil on him? Silver, the size of my palm, bearing the symbol of an ash-tree.

Id: [0x002D9BFB]
I know where Gorm is camped. If you wish to see him without anyone the wiser, there is a trick I can teach you.

Id: [0x002D9BFC]
Use your cloak to obscure your face. Blend into the crowd, divert attention, hide in plain sight.

Id: [0x002D9BFD]
Said like that, you make me blush.

Id: [0x002D9BFE]
A few things you should know before you step into his camp.

Id: [0x002D9BFF]
A hood makes you forgettable, dismissed at a distance.

Id: [0x002D9C00]
Remain far from watchful eyes and you will be invisible to them.

Id: [0x002D9C01]
Do not draw blade or hammer, for these and other sudden movements can break your disguise.

Id: [0x002D9C02]
And in case I wasn't clear, you will need to put up your hood for the trick to work.

Id: [0x002D9C03]
You dare not break the king's peace here, so fuck you and your god talk. What say you to that?

Id: [0x002D9C04]
[laugh]You can beat me, but you will not kill me. Not under Harald's truce.

Id: [0x002D9C05]
Keep crowing, Eivor. You only make yourself an easier target.

Id: [0x002D9C06]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed. You are Kjotve's slayer. This man has slandered your clan. What shall I do with him?

Id: [0x002D9C07]
Do you dream of a glorious future, Eivor? A warrior like you would be a boon to my clan.

Id: [0x002D9C08]
You intrigue me, Wolf-Kissed. Orphan and sibling. Warrior and poet. You are many in one, it seems.

Id: [0x002D9C09]
I have eyes and ears everywhere, as any effective king must. Would you not be one of my ravens?

Id: [0x002D9C0A]
I understand. Yet should your fortunes change, you are welcome in my hall.

Id: [0x002D9C0B]
It would be best for us both if you left Norway. To avoid the heat that comes with such friction.

Id: [0x002D9C0C]
I wish I understood you better. For those I do not understand, I do not trust. And I cannot stomach a lack of trust.

Id: [0x002D9C0D]
Then know, that if you stay in Norway, both you and your brother must serve under me. Take tomorrow to think on this.

Id: [0x002D9C0E]
The Sons of Ragnar are in need of warriors in Jorvik. Glory and good pay. I could save you a seat on our ship.

Id: [0x002D9C0F]
Wherever destiny takes you, know that you always have a place at my table.

Id: [0x002D9C10]
As is your right, but what of a karl like me? Those at the bottom drink what dribbles from up top.

Id: [0x002D9C11]
Says the child of a jarl then a king then a jarl.

Id: [0x002D9C12]
Look there, Eivor. Your childhood home.

Id: [0x002D9C13]
You're a cheery one. You should drink more if the past pains you that much.

Id: [0x002D9C14]
You, there, what are you doing?

Id: [0x002D9C15]
If you wish to have words, come closer.

Id: [0x002D9C16]
Enough. A new path is revealed and your journey will be challenging.

Id: [0x002D9C17]
O, you know Svend! An old man with old ideas. Cannot stand the idea of living under a young king.

Id: [0x002D9C18]
This isn't your fight.

Id: [0x002D9C19]
You were warned, farmer.

Id: [0x002D9C1A]
You stay out of this!

Id: [0x002D9C1B]
Uh? You'll what?

Id: [0x002D9C1C]
Take him then. And keep him quiet or we will be back.

Id: [0x002D9C1D]
Gods, is this real? Huh. I might detain a few more of your friends for this price.

Id: [0x002D9C1E]
Your blacksmith is busy. Come back later.

Id: [0x002D9C1F]
Then let fate guide our journey. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002D9C20]
Are you ready to set sail, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D9C21]
Here you could be a king's hero, Eivor. Your name, known all across Harald's many kingdoms.

Id: [0x002D9C22]
Seventeen winters ago, I opened my door to you, Eivor. And now … your only thanks is to rob me?

Id: [0x002D9C23]
I should have left you to the wolves.

Id: [0x002D9C24]
Sad old elk. Do not carry his words with you to England. He brought this day upon himself.

Id: [0x002D9C25]
No, you must be his better half.

Id: [0x002D9C26]
Can you believe it, Eivor? I have never seen a ship loaded so fast.

Id: [0x002D9C27]
Thank you, Eivor. As a gift, I could design a new tattoo for you. Something to decorate your scar.

Id: [0x002D9C28]
O, I did not mean to offend. In any case, I do have a tattoo for you.

Id: [0x002D9C29]
O! You've come back.

Id: [0x002D9C2A]
Thank you, Eivor. Now, I have something for you.

Id: [0x002D9C2B]
Where are you going? Come back!

Id: [0x002D9C2C]
Eivor, can you teach me the art of archery?

Id: [0x002D9C2D]
Alvis tells me this brew is too strong. Think you can handle a few rounds?

Id: [0x002D9C2E]
Think you can match horns with me, hm?

Id: [0x002D9C2F]
Bring me three deer antlers to prove your skills and I might just have a story for you.

Id: [0x002D9C30]
Eivor. You're back!

Id: [0x002D9C31]
Welcome back! You look well-traveled and rugged.

Id: [0x002D9C32]
Eivor, good day.

Id: [0x002D9C33]
I know, I only wish my father's long shadow didn't darken my prospects here. I want to learn from you, not watch you.

Id: [0x002D9C34]
Hm. This will do. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9C35]
I am most at home helping others. May we return to the subject of your visions?

Id: [0x002D9C36]
I need one more ingredient to finish an elixir for you. Look around the pond there. You will find what I require.

Id: [0x002D9C37]
Once brewed, this elixir will help you dive deeper into your visions, to see them more clearly.

Id: [0x002D9C38]
The elixir is ready. It will taste like misery itself, but it will open your mind to the sights and sounds of the nine worlds.

Id: [0x002D9C39]
In taking this, you will have access to the All-Father's wisdom. You will walk the path of Odin, and live as he lived so long ago.

Id: [0x002D9C3A]
Welcome back. Your face is bright and your eyes seem clearer. Tell me of everything you have seen.

Id: [0x002D9C3B]
And what have you learned?

Id: [0x002D9C3C]
Because he had hid the truth from you?

Id: [0x002D9C3D]
Perhaps this was the purpose of your vision. To overcome an inner fear and find forgiveness in your heart.

Id: [0x002D9C3E]
Perhaps this aspect of your vision inspires bravery. Truly you are touched by the gods. Was there more?

Id: [0x002D9C3F]
Eivor, your visions are unlike any I have encountered.

Id: [0x002D9C40]
Leave me now. I must think on what you have shared.

Id: [0x002D9C41]
Here you are. And be careful. This brew will feel as cold as ice on your lips, yet will burn like a fire in your belly.

Id: [0x002D9C42]
Eivor. What has happened? What have you seen?

Id: [0x002D9C43]
Hm, yes, that can happen. Return when you are rested and we will try again.

Id: [0x002D9C44]
Come, settle your mind and tell me what you have seen.

Id: [0x002D9C45]
Fascinating. Was that your final vision?

Id: [0x002D9C46]
The elixir is ready when you are.

Id: [0x002D9C47]
Eivor, you have awakened. With more to share I hope.

Id: [0x002D9C48]
And what did you see?

Id: [0x002D9C49]
You visit lore and legend. Things I would never have imagined to be real. Parables, yet here you live them as memories.

Id: [0x002D9C4A]
Selfishness unmeasured often feels this way. What else did you see?

Id: [0x002D9C4B]
The thrust of these visions seem clear to me. As in your first reverie, a fear of betrayal hangs upon you.

Id: [0x002D9C4C]
Odin has seen fit to gift you with his infinite knowledge, and the treasure of his experience.

Id: [0x002D9C4D]
Perhaps his tale is a warning. The indifference he felt is a great pity. See that you do not follow this same road.

Id: [0x002D9C4E]
Thank you for treating Hytham with respect and kindness, Eivor. He has found a family among your clan.

Id: [0x002D9C4F]
Greetings.

Id: [0x002D9C50]
We must not rush our landing. All you see here is Saxon territory. The Kingdom of Mercia, largely unpacified.

Id: [0x002D9C51]
And I will be right behind you!

Id: [0x002D9C52]
Eivor, where are you going?

Id: [0x002D9C53]
Ah! Y-you're not a bandit, are you?

Id: [0x002D9C54]
W-wait, who are you? Are you with those brigands as well?

Id: [0x002D9C55]
You there, untie us! Let us walk and we will not hurt you!

Id: [0x002D9C56]
Now come. Randvi has found something I would like you to see.

Id: [0x002D9C57]
Hm. I like it. The poet in you sings once again. One day, this name will be known throughout all of England.

Id: [0x002D9C58]
Agreed. We should begin with a forge. Can you help Gunnar get working again?

Id: [0x002D9C59]
Though you do remind me … I found a map among the bandits' rubbish. Marked up with the locations of Saxon monk-huts.

Id: [0x002D9C5A]
Take the map with you. And put it to better use than they did.

Id: [0x002D9C5B]
Are you certain there aren't a few more gold nuggets squirreled away somewhere?

Id: [0x002D9C5C]
So, Eivor? What's your count?

Id: [0x002D9C5D]
Have you finished building Gunnar's forge?

Id: [0x002D9C5E]
Eivor. We must speak when you have finished with Gunnar.

Id: [0x002D9C5F]
My finest weapon. For this room is yours … here you may lay your head, hang your axe, or be alone with your thoughts.

Id: [0x002D9C60]
This is not special treatment. I want you here in the longhouse, close at hand.

Id: [0x002D9C61]
I may be the jarl of this clan, but you and I lead together. As ever.

Id: [0x002D9C62]
So get acquainted with your room. And when you are ready, meet me at the stables.

Id: [0x002D9C63]
I am riding to Ledecestrescire, to a town called Repton. Eivor, I expect you to join me when you have finished here.

Id: [0x002D9C64]
Not yet. First speak with Randvi. She has more than one task for you here.

Id: [0x002D9C65]
Apart from growing this settlement, you must seek out alliances as well. We cannot pacify England with so few friends.

Id: [0x002D9C66]
Ah, there you are.

Id: [0x002D9C67]
Eivor, I have something to show you.

Id: [0x002D9C68]
Eivor, my stable is a bit spare just now, but if you can build me something better, I promise you the finest of beasts.

Id: [0x002D9C69]
Ah! Hello, hello. Are you the leader of this bustling encampment?

Id: [0x002D9C6A]
If you need it, we have it. If we don't have it, you don't need it. Such is our pledge.

Id: [0x002D9C6B]
My friend, you look upon the Master of the Thousand Eyes! The head of our guild!

Id: [0x002D9C6C]
A legend, a hero of the people, and the richest merchant west of the Indus! You look upon … Reda!

Id: [0x002D9C6D]
Perhaps we have met in another life. But, most likely, I have a common face.

Id: [0x002D9C6E]
The Thousand Eyes have one thousand ears as well. And word travels fast.

Id: [0x002D9C6F]
It's quite simple. For a fee, I can connect you to a shadow market that stretches from the dunes of Egypt to the moors of England.

Id: [0x002D9C70]
It varies with the item. But there is a small hitch.

Id: [0x002D9C71]
You may hold it and keep it, Eivor. A gift from Reda for your immeasurable hospitality.

Id: [0x002D9C72]
An excellent choice. And a lucky one too. For nothing in stock lingers very long. My selection changes daily.

Id: [0x002D9C73]
Nothing for now, no matter! My selection changes daily. You will soon find something you like.

Id: [0x002D9C74]
Now that you are friends with me, you are also a friend of the Thousand Eyes as well!

Id: [0x002D9C75]
Observe my outfit, note the scarf I wear. As you travel, you will meet many of my associates, clad in these same vestments.

Id: [0x002D9C76]
These are my people, my other Eyes. Seek them out for trade or contracts. Oblige them and you will earn a tidy sum.

Id: [0x002D9C77]
And I might even feel inclined to reward you myself.

Id: [0x002D9C78]
O yes, and you needn't even thank me! We would be honored to call this our home. Good day!

Id: [0x002D9C79]
And how are you? In spite of your stoic look, there is a brightness in your eyes that warms me.

Id: [0x002D9C7A]
And your visions?

Id: [0x002D9C7B]
All these people you have brought here, this life you have built on these stranger shores. Does it please you?

Id: [0x002D9C7C]
You speak first of yourself when I ask this question … which says more than you intend, I think.

Id: [0x002D9C7D]
Tell me about your visions.

Id: [0x002D9C7E]
And does the All-Father still appear before you?

Id: [0x002D9C7F]
Lovely, just as you promised. As soon as I am set up here, we can return to the matter of your visions.

Id: [0x002D9C80]
You are touched, Eivor. A conduit for godly tidings. Please … let me help.

Id: [0x002D9C81]
I may know a way to clarify these visions. An elixir that may open the door of your mind into the realm of the gods.

Id: [0x002D9C82]
Eivor! What a pleasure to see you!

Id: [0x002D9C83]
In Lunden, they now operate without restraint. If you were to eradicate them, the city would be in your debt.

Id: [0x002D9C84]
Good. Yet before you do, there is something else. A gift I wish to share.

Id: [0x002D9C85]
I cannot show you here. Will you walk with me?

Id: [0x002D9C86]
You have returned. Will you come with me, now?

Id: [0x002D9C87]
I should not expect you do. When we first arrived, I noted a shadow of suspicion in your eyes. A doubt, a wariness.

Id: [0x002D9C88]
It will not come from me. It is a gift you must give yourself.

Id: [0x002D9C89]
It is a thing better demonstrated than described.

Id: [0x002D9C8A]
Could you return to the boat, please?

Id: [0x002D9C8B]
Like your meditation, it centers our minds, steadies our hands, and purges fear from our hearts.

Id: [0x002D9C8C]
And more practically, it aids our movements, in flight or in stealth.

Id: [0x002D9C8D]
There it is again, the shadow of a doubt.

Id: [0x002D9C8E]
To perform the Leap of Faith, you must give yourself over to something greater.

Id: [0x002D9C8F]
Yourself. Embrace the hope that death will not come before you are prepared to meet it. Believe this and you will fear nothing.

Id: [0x002D9C90]
Good. Then your mind is already attuned to my lesson.

Id: [0x002D9C91]
You see? My faith proved stronger than my fear!

Id: [0x002D9C92]
Eivor, I have not seen this side of you before! Do not feed your fear, conquer it!

Id: [0x002D9C93]
I will leap first. On my word, you must follow. Lean into your faith, into your strength, and take flight.

Id: [0x002D9C94]
Of course. And thank you, Eivor … for hearing me out.

Id: [0x002D9C95]
I did not see you jump. Something holding you back?

Id: [0x002D9C96]
I might try if I believed you would join. But that is not my purpose in England. Basim and I are hunting larger prey.

Id: [0x002D9C97]
Yet they sit on a great many of England's thrones. If you seek to pacify England for the safety of your clan…

Id: [0x002D9C98]
You may think this land ruled by harmless jarls and bumbling thegns, yet look more closely and you will find a deeper threat.

Id: [0x002D9C99]
If we work together towards this end, it will benefit us both. You will have greater influence over the kingdoms of England.

Id: [0x002D9C9A]
Exactly. You should begin in Lunden. I have credible reports that The Order is working now to seize the city.

Id: [0x002D9C9B]
And while you are there, be on the lookout for our symbol. Centuries ago, the Hidden Ones had bureaus built around England.

Id: [0x002D9C9C]
Then you must start, Eivor. Give us a summary of our recent gains, for instance. The clan is thirsty for knowledge.

Id: [0x002D9C9D]
You seat yourself as Sigurd's equal in these tales of yours. Would Sigurd do the same if he were here?

Id: [0x002D9C9E]
I only say what I feel, that being a hot wind blowing from your ass!

Id: [0x002D9C9F]
To Sigurd! May he return and relieve us of you!

Id: [0x002D9CA0]
You think me drunk, Eivor? Would it soften my blows if I was?

Id: [0x002D9CA1]
My eyes are clear and open. And I see before me one eager to claim a piece of Sigurd's glory.

Id: [0x002D9CA2]
Just as I thought. You--

Id: [0x002D9CA3]
[pain]You bore me.

Id: [0x002D9CA4]
I see you, Eivor. And I know what you are.

Id: [0x002D9CA5]
I cannot devise a strategy if my advice is ignored.

Id: [0x002D9CA6]
For once, you see clearly. I beg the gods that it continues.

Id: [0x002D9CA7]
Eivor, this matter requires sensitive judgment. Will you…?

Id: [0x002D9CA8]
Well, now! There is no excuse too small, I see … nothing to keep you from coveting that seat, is there?

Id: [0x002D9CA9]
You might leave them to work it out for themselves. But that would mean … letting go, would it not?

Id: [0x002D9CAA]
Eivor, you have known me as a skald for years. You have seen how my poems bring life and joy and wisdom to our people.

Id: [0x002D9CAB]
And you know that my work requires a certain, let us say, freedom … to make use of rare resources to compose my verses.

Id: [0x002D9CAC]
Huh. As you are aware, Holger and I are neighbors. Near enough that I often catch him at my stables, stealing my tools.

Id: [0x002D9CAD]
My horse looks a fool, Eivor! No handsomer than a donkey now. You must do something.

Id: [0x002D9CAE]
You never found him, did you? Tell us, Eivor! We deserve the truth!

Id: [0x002D9CAF]
You never found him … because you didn't look.

Id: [0x002D9CB0]
I see you, Eivor. I know what you are.

Id: [0x002D9CB1]
Your habits are not my own, Eivor. I do not flee responsibility for the sake of my glory. I stand firm with my people.

Id: [0x002D9CB2]
For many months, I have stood at your side, keeping faith in Sigurd's judgment. Because I believed in him and his vision.

Id: [0x002D9CB3]
Do as Eivor commands, he told me. And I have. Against my better judgment, I did as you have asked me.

Id: [0x002D9CB4]
And where has that left us? Without a jarl, without a purpose, watching you chase glory around this land like a spooked hare.

Id: [0x002D9CB5]
No. We fight to the death.

Id: [0x002D9CB6]
This is not a question, Eivor. Come.

Id: [0x002D9CB7]
Is that the best you can do?

Id: [0x002D9CB8]
Eh! You've gone soft!

Id: [0x002D9CB9]
[pain]Eivor … you … you--

Id: [0x002D9CBA]
Yes. And the cost of disrespect is death. You said it yourself.

Id: [0x002D9CBB]
All he demanded, you gave him. That should be enough, for I have no need for one so fragile in my hall of heroes.

Id: [0x002D9CBC]
Does it? You killed him all the same.

Id: [0x002D9CBD]
What is the true cost of disrespect? The choice lies with you.

Id: [0x002D9CBE]
Yes, you missed me. Once or twice, I hear.

Id: [0x002D9CBF]
You took your time to find me. Was it for this, to enjoy your time on my throne?

Id: [0x002D9CC0]
And slew all those who questioned you?

Id: [0x002D9CC1]
You could not even begin to imagine the thing I've seen. What I've learned.

Id: [0x002D9CC2]
Born of gods, is who I am. A Lord of War! A Roman Mars! I know who I am, I know my destiny! And you will not hinder me!

Id: [0x002D9CC3]
Could you speak with him? Settle his mind.

Id: [0x002D9CC4]
Have you spoken with Sigurd yet?

Id: [0x002D9CC5]
Do not let Sigurd's present mood upset you. He spoke warmly of you as we sailed him.

Id: [0x002D9CC6]
I believe he still trusts you more deeply than he can express.

Id: [0x002D9CC7]
You may think me less than I was, but this is not so. I am greater than before.

Id: [0x002D9CC8]
I am more than the man I was, more than this hobbling stick that stands before you.

Id: [0x002D9CC9]
You must look harder, Eivor. Deeper. See for yourself what they found in me.

Id: [0x002D9CCA]
You are kind, but your eyes are clouded by the past, a place I can no longer see. I fear our paths diverged long ago.

Id: [0x002D9CCB]
Another dispute, I'm afraid … with Holger stirring the pot once again. Will you sit in judgment?

Id: [0x002D9CCC]
He refuses to leave his quarters. Right now, you are the only noble fit for this.

Id: [0x002D9CCD]
Please. Only until Sigurd recovers his strength.

Id: [0x002D9CCE]
Cruel and unfair? O, no. No, you have it backwards. I am the definition of what is fair and what is not.

Id: [0x002D9CCF]
I am your jarl, the source of all right and wrong. The lord of justice in this place.

Id: [0x002D9CD0]
Without rank, without order, without a chain of command, life cannot endure! Chaos will reign. Do you understand?

Id: [0x002D9CD1]
[laugh]Have you never in your life known when to hold your tongue, Eivor? Nor defer to those wiser than yourself?

Id: [0x002D9CD2]
See to it that judgment is carried out exactly as I have said.

Id: [0x002D9CD3]
What is this? What are you doing?

Id: [0x002D9CD4]
That duty is mine alone, Eivor. You know this! Stand aside!

Id: [0x002D9CD5]
A sallow excuse for such a bold defiance. I hope you enjoyed it.

Id: [0x002D9CD6]
Eivor! You've returned!

Id: [0x002D9CD7]
Eivor, is that you?

Id: [0x002D9CD8]
Stand. This seat is yours.

Id: [0x002D9CD9]
It suits you.

Id: [0x002D9CDA]
Your secret is no longer safe.

Id: [0x002D9CDB]
Will you speak to your people?

Id: [0x002D9CDC]
Eivor, yes. A long stroll through the hills and fields of Mercia. All so I could thank you.

Id: [0x002D9CDD]
For sending my brother to his just reward, in spite of the harm he caused you and everyone around you.

Id: [0x002D9CDE]
He is. And as a show of thanks, I came to offer you a gift. A token of my respect.

Id: [0x002D9CDF]
Put it to good use Wolf-Kissed. And may we meet again soon. On a battlefield, if the fates are kind.

Id: [0x002D9CE0]
Do not make pleasant with me, Wolf-Kissed. I know what you did. Did you think you could keep it a secret forever?

Id: [0x002D9CE1]
My brother! Ivarr! You banished him to Helheim! Denied him a seat in Odin's hall!

Id: [0x002D9CE2]
Speak no more, Eivor. Lies are all you know. I want this settled. One on one, fist to fist. Come!

Id: [0x002D9CE3]
Would you have denied me my reward, Eivor? Had it come to it?

Id: [0x002D9CE4]
It was your right to kill my brother for the violence he gave. But you condemned him to icy Hel for all time.

Id: [0x002D9CE5]
For that, be thankful I do not kill you where you stand.

Id: [0x002D9CE6]
You had best hope our paths do not cross while I yet mourn, lest kindness fail me.

Id: [0x002D9CE7]
Let us see how well a weasel fights!

Id: [0x002D9CE8]
I will show you all the mercy you showed Ivarr!

Id: [0x002D9CE9]
How dare you say such a thing?

Id: [0x002D9CEA]
You will again know the strength of the Sons of Ragnarr!

Id: [0x002D9CEB]
Soon, yes. She was on her way.

Id: [0x002D9CEC]
The best ones were about you.

Id: [0x002D9CED]
Eivor, you giant steaming bowl of elk piss! [laugh]King Oswald sends his regards.

Id: [0x002D9CEE]
Gods, you're a sight to stir a weary heart.

Id: [0x002D9CEF]
It's, ah … good to see you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9CF0]
You must be Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9CF1]
I've heard much of you, young one. They say you're something. We'll see.

Id: [0x002D9CF2]
Respect where it is due. I like that. Here's hoping you fight as smoothly as you talk.

Id: [0x002D9CF3]
Your allies are on their way. We must be patient.

Id: [0x002D9CF4]
With these numbers? Are you keen to see Valhalla today?

Id: [0x002D9CF5]
A third keeps watch on the hills south of Croindene. But I warn you, these are all we know of. There may be more.

Id: [0x002D9CF6]
You had better be all they promised.

Id: [0x002D9CF7]
I want Portcestre. You want what is held within her. And I will not become king by passing up chances like this.

Id: [0x002D9CF8]
You are not short on confidence. That much is clear.

Id: [0x002D9CF9]
I have known plenty as brash as you. Not many are left in this world.

Id: [0x002D9CFA]
If your method is to risk hundreds for the sake of one, then you are right. I don't.

Id: [0x002D9CFB]
I say your haste has put us squarely in the shit.

Id: [0x002D9CFC]
Eivor, this mess is of your making!

Id: [0x002D9CFD]
You'll join your friend soon enough.

Id: [0x002D9CFE]
You bear your false deities like a plague to this land. But you know nothing of those who truly decide our fate.

Id: [0x002D9CFF]
I will tell Fulke her opponent is a weakling who does not have the stomach to finish what they started.

Id: [0x002D9D00]
You will regret this mercy!

Id: [0x002D9D01]
No blame stains you, Eivor. He cut his own path. Always did.

Id: [0x002D9D02]
Reckless stripling! I warned you the risk was too great!

Id: [0x002D9D03]
Small comfort that is to the dead.

Id: [0x002D9D04]
Indeed. The fault is none but mine for putting my trust in you.

Id: [0x002D9D05]
What you need is to swallow your pride, Raven-Feeder. Listen to wiser heads than yours.

Id: [0x002D9D06]
No. You are supposed to be a leader. So listen now.

Id: [0x002D9D07]
You want your jarl back, you must be cold as frost. Bravery is your enemy as often as your friend.

Id: [0x002D9D08]
Gather your allies. Pick your moment. Then, and only then … you crush them.

Id: [0x002D9D09]
You can triumph yet. Go with the wisdom of Odin, the power of Thor, the wit of Freyja. Go and find your brother.

Id: [0x002D9D0A]
Then there is wisdom in you as well.

Id: [0x002D9D0B]
I am glad to hear it. The unexamined life is not worth living.

Id: [0x002D9D0C]
A lion's heart and a crow's cunning. Guthrum judged you too swiftly.

Id: [0x002D9D0D]
I understand. I promised my aid, and I will keep my word.

Id: [0x002D9D0E]
We have your back, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9D0F]
Not like you to leave a job unfinished.

Id: [0x002D9D10]
I will hold you to that. See you at the camp.

Id: [0x002D9D11]
Well fought, Eivor. My archers and I will return to camp and await your further orders.

Id: [0x002D9D12]
It may surprise you, but I was no stranger to horse and hunt in my younger days.

Id: [0x002D9D13]
It is Fulke I fight. A false Christian, preaching a corruption of God's word. If I can assist in her downfall, I will.

Id: [0x002D9D14]
I appreciate your efforts to spare the innocent, Eivor. At least we saved some lives here.

Id: [0x002D9D15]
Eivor, forgive me. I have slain too many of my own people already. I cannot kill more. I must return to Lunden.

Id: [0x002D9D16]
Godspeed, Eivor. I pray you come back safe.

Id: [0x002D9D17]
That's Vili Jarl to you, peasant. Now take a knee and kiss my ring.

Id: [0x002D9D18]
Careful, Eivor. Don't make me thrash your hide as I did when we were children.

Id: [0x002D9D19]
I look forward to it. Now let us find your brother.

Id: [0x002D9D1A]
Eluric said you talked some sense into him, before he drowned his wits in mead. Alfida and I thank you deeply for that.

Id: [0x002D9D1B]
Advice? You need none of that now. You stand in no one's shadow, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9D1C]
The ache of absent souls is a wound that never heals. But we may yet return your brother to your side. There is that.

Id: [0x002D9D1D]
I wish I were as sure of it as you.

Id: [0x002D9D1E]
You are quite the agent of chaos. Fulke's men are chasing their tails, not knowing where you will strike next.

Id: [0x002D9D1F]
And you have bought time for your allies to arrive. Many have come, not least the bishop here.

Id: [0x002D9D20]
We may begin the assault at once. Or you might wish to speak with your allies if you have not done so already?

Id: [0x002D9D21]
Your warriors are eager for battle. Are you?

Id: [0x002D9D22]
Return when you are ready.

Id: [0x002D9D23]
Eivor! Did you enjoy the gift I left you in Canterbury?

Id: [0x002D9D24]
We have nothing to settle. Die on these walls if you will. It is your choice.

Id: [0x002D9D25]
Then come. Claim your brother, if you can. I shall wait with him.

Id: [0x002D9D26]
If you would find us, you need only follow his screams.

Id: [0x002D9D27]
We meet again, heathen! You should have killed me when you had the chance!

Id: [0x002D9D28]
Your strength is unmatched, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D9D29]
Guard yourself, Wolf-Kissed. You are Sigurd's last hope.

Id: [0x002D9D2A]
There, Eivor! You are our champion.

Id: [0x002D9D2B]
Well done, Eivor. All fall in your wake.

Id: [0x002D9D2C]
Do not fall, Eivor. We need your axe-arm!

Id: [0x002D9D2D]
Eivor! Pull back, you cannot fall here!

Id: [0x002D9D2E]
Are you her nursemaid? Why do you ask?

Id: [0x002D9D2F]
I have done all I could to help him, Eivor. The rest is up to you.

Id: [0x002D9D30]
Let me stay with him. You deal with Fulke.

Id: [0x002D9D31]
You fight beneath a banner of ignorance, Eivor. I could pull back the curtain for you. Give you a glimpse of what lies beyond.

Id: [0x002D9D32]
If you will not raise your eyes to the light, I'll bury you in the dark.

Id: [0x002D9D33]
My cause is greater than you can comprehend.

Id: [0x002D9D34]
Look inside yourself, Eivor. Summon all the power you can!

Id: [0x002D9D35]
You meddle in matters you do not understand!

Id: [0x002D9D36]
You are more like Sigurd than you know.

Id: [0x002D9D37]
Blind of mind, blind of sight.

Id: [0x002D9D38]
What use have you for eyes if you refuse to see?

Id: [0x002D9D39]
You have power, Eivor. Maybe more than you know.

Id: [0x002D9D3A]
Even when I offer the truth, you refuse it.

Id: [0x002D9D3B]
Do you not wonder, Eivor, at the things I have learned?

Id: [0x002D9D3C]
Sigurd is an Ancient One! An archon, Nephilim, Isu, call him what you will. He is reborn!

Id: [0x002D9D3D]
At least I'll have the satisfaction of seeing you die!

Id: [0x002D9D3E]
Do you feel it? Do you feel death coming for you?

Id: [0x002D9D3F]
You can wound my flesh, but my work will live on for all time!

Id: [0x002D9D40]
You are more like your brother than I realized, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9D41]
And you will go with me to the grave.

Id: [0x002D9D42]
You misunderstand, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9D43]
She has saved your brother!

Id: [0x002D9D44]
Hers was the great work, the highest achievement of humankind. Now you, Eivor - you must carry it forward.

Id: [0x002D9D45]
Fight well, Eivor. Find us at the settlement when you can.

Id: [0x002D9D46]
Guthrum was hasty in his judgment, Eivor. You are fit to stand with the best of us.

Id: [0x002D9D47]
Go to your brother. The words of one beloved will heal him faster than herbs. I will see to matters here.

Id: [0x002D9D48]
What are you doing still talking to me? Enough goodbyes. Go to Sigurd!

Id: [0x002D9D49]
O, it was nothing, you know! All in a day's work.

Id: [0x002D9D4A]
Smell that air! Smells like victory!

Id: [0x002D9D4B]
Ah, you always were soft. Get on with you!

Id: [0x002D9D4C]
Be proud, Eivor. You found Sigurd, against the odds.

Id: [0x002D9D4D]
A trifle in comparison to the great service you have rendered me.

Id: [0x002D9D4E]
Eivor, don't make me laugh. We both know what my word is worth. But sure, I will let you do the talking. Probably.

Id: [0x002D9D4F]
Peace. Is that what you think is going to happen here? I told you, I know this bastard.

Id: [0x002D9D50]
I did not know you were so foolish with coin.

Id: [0x002D9D51]
Now you dangle silver before me? Are you so frightened of the Britons that you fight your battles with wealth?

Id: [0x002D9D52]
You do not need me to hold your hand, Eivor. I will head to Wesberie, scout around.

Id: [0x002D9D53]
Peace is for suckling babes, but as you like.

Id: [0x002D9D54]
Bah! I prefer sound and fury. But do as you must.

Id: [0x002D9D55]
Am I to stand here drooling like the village idiot, waiting for your success?

Id: [0x002D9D56]
Eivor! Are you not done? Have you stopped to nap?

Id: [0x002D9D57]
You do not know Rhodri as I do, Eivor. You do not know what a slippery, lying shit he can be.

Id: [0x002D9D58]
Eivor. That silver you gave me in Quatford. I traded it for a gold ring.

Id: [0x002D9D59]
Fuck you, Wolf-Kissed. I know Rhodri, and I know the kind of tricks he will pull. That is me warning you.

Id: [0x002D9D5A]
If you hear me farting, that is my welcome to the bastard!

Id: [0x002D9D5B]
No mercy this time, Wolf-Kissed. You spared that wet turd, Leofrith. We will not spare Rhodri.

Id: [0x002D9D5C]
Called in a dragon to help me slay Rhodri. Now what say you, Wolf-Kissed? Are you ready for war?

Id: [0x002D9D5D]
Load this lump of lard onto your horse and we will go. Take care he stays alive.

Id: [0x002D9D5E]
A fight to the death, you and me! If I win, I am the greatest vikingr who ever lived. If I lose, what a tale you have to tell.

Id: [0x002D9D5F]
If I kill you, I stop. No more! There is no greater prize after you!

Id: [0x002D9D60]
[laugh]Ah… In my younger days, you would be dead by now.

Id: [0x002D9D61]
Do you remember your first kill? Mine was a boyhood friend. He squealed like a piglet. Like Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002D9D62]
I should have met you in younger days. I would be wearing your face as a trophy now!

Id: [0x002D9D63]
You know me, Eivor. You even backed me when I killed Rhodri's half-wit brother!

Id: [0x002D9D64]
Have you no sense of menace! When I stabbed Gwriad, you winced. You cower in the face of sudden drama.

Id: [0x002D9D65]
You should have helped land the knife!

Id: [0x002D9D66]
Hold a moment, Eivor … let me ask you something…

Id: [0x002D9D67]
Will you see your father in Valhalla, Wolf-Kissed? Or is the coward in Helheim, weeping tears of ice?

Id: [0x002D9D68]
Come on, then. If you're so hot to die.

Id: [0x002D9D69]
You'll do better next time.

Id: [0x002D9D6A]
You can't go harder than that?

Id: [0x002D9D6C]
If an evil man brings you biscuits, do you gift them to your children?

Id: [0x002D9D6D]
It's okay, friend. You know where to find me if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002D9D6E]
Well, I'll be… You knocked the straw right out of that dummy's belly!

Id: [0x002D9D6F]
Well, well. Twang! Twang! Twang! You've got some firepower in you.

Id: [0x002D9DAD]
Ah. This one takes after me, Brother.

Id: [0x002D9DAE]
Our jarl has waited long enough. We follow the Wolf-Kissed to the encampment.

Id: [0x002D9DAF]
Find the pagan! We will burn that sinner, just like the others.

Id: [0x002D9DB0]
Stay out of the way, heathen!

Id: [0x002D9DB1]
Until our paths cross again, old friend.

Id: [0x002D9DB2]
O, something like, "I was stupid, selfish, reckless, blind, boneheaded, and I smell like blood and shit."

Id: [0x002D9DB3]
Even with you half in the grave, we could easily take them.

Id: [0x002D9DB4]
Well, well! The feeder-of-ravens returns. And not half dead.

Id: [0x002D9DB5]
Lower? My friend, look at my wares, my weapons. I'm not a man to settle for less than the finest of anything!

Id: [0x002D9DB6]
This morning we traded with a ship passing south. They told us Eivor the Wolf-Kissed was captured by Kjotve's men.

Id: [0x002D9DB7]
Well said, my sharp-tongued warrior-skald. May we all live to hear that saga sung.

Id: [0x002D9DB8]
A Dane! A Dane has come!

Id: [0x002D9DB9]
Are you friend or enemy?

Id: [0x002D9DBA]
Rarer than an honest man in England! You must keep your eyes open for this mineral! It has great value.

Id: [0x002D9DBB]
[pain]Have mercy, friend, and you may find an ally with us.

Id: [0x002D9DBC]
Greetings from the North, old friend.

Id: [0x002D9DBD]
Eivor! My second favorite Norse!

Id: [0x002D9DBE]
Ah, here's the Raven-Feeder now.

Id: [0x002D9DBF]
I hoped to take Portcestre with this one, but Fulke is forewarned now. I have no more appetite for this. I will go west.

Id: [0x002D9DC0]
Ah, the diplomat speaks what he really feels.

Id: [0x002D9DC1]
It is time to scout Rhodri's fortress. Are you ready?

Id: [0x002D9DC2]
Ready to take this miserable castle? The dragon is hungry for Briton blood.

Id: [0x002D9DC3]
How rude.

Id: [0x002D9DC4]
Well struck, Dane!

Id: [0x002D9DC7]
Walk with me, Wolf-Kissed. We have some time before the ceremony.

Id: [0x002D9DC8]
Ready the sea-beasts. Eivor Wolf-Kissed is here to escort us up river.

Id: [0x002D9DC9]
Eivor, a friend of old is a good omen.

Id: [0x002D9DCA]
The convoy remains, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002D9DCB]
You have made this old man proud. Each of you.

Id: [0x002D9DCC]
We are nearly there.

Id: [0x002D9DCD]
Slow yourselves. Eivor, we cannot just go running around the city poking and prodding and killing at will.

Id: [0x002D9DCE]
I must return and prepare for the Yuletide feast, but I will do so with a bent ear and a keen eye. Be safe.

Id: [0x002D9DCF]
I must return and prepare for the Yuletide feast, but I will do so with a bent ear and a keen eye. Be safe.

Id: [0x002D9DD0]
Abbess Ingeborg, this is Eivor, our honored guest from the south. Eivor has offered to help rid Jorvik of the Red Hand.

Id: [0x002D9DD1]
Block the exits. Don't let this one escape!

Id: [0x002D9DD2]
Welcome back, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D9DD3]
Wolf-Kissed! Welcome back!

Id: [0x002D9DD4]
Look at this! Once again, Eivor Wolf-Kissed appears to take a swipe at me!

Id: [0x002D9DD5]
Heed the price of our war, Wolf-Kissed. The harvest of three dead generations. All their names, unknown. It all means nothing.

Id: [0x002D9DD6]
If the dead could speak, what would they say of their deaths, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002D9DD7]
Be careful out there.

Id: [0x002D9DD8]
Eivor. Awake so soon…?

Id: [0x002D9DD9]
Likely story, Wolf-Kissed. Me, I killed … twenty-six I think.

Id: [0x002D9DDA]
He does, Eivor Wolf-Kissed. It is a pleasure to meet you at last.

Id: [0x002D9DDB]
Good day! A new customer!

Id: [0x002D9DDC]
Put this one to honest work, that is what I like to see!

Id: [0x002D9DDD]
When does Eivor return? When can we settle this?

Id: [0x002D9DDE]
Stop there, Wolf-Kissed. This ends now.

Id: [0x002D9DDF]
Goodbye, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D9DE0]
That is a rash gamble, Raven-Feeder. If we are spotted, we will be vulnerable.

Id: [0x002D9DE1]
You have not seen the half of my wrath! How many of my men now lie dead on account of this glory-hoarder?

Id: [0x002D9DE2]
Need some help, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002D9DE3]
Stand ready, Eivor. When they see us, they will charge. We must defend the men.

Id: [0x002D9DE4]
Eivor has returned! Hail, Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002D9DE5]
As King Killer. They do not all get away like Burgred did, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002D9DE6]
Like a son to me! Yes, yes! So fight me, Wolf-Kissed! To a glorious death!

Id: [0x002D9DE7]
Gulled again!

Id: [0x002D9DE8]
Stronger than I thought…

Id: [0x002D9DE9]
Basim, watch over this one and see that he warms himself with drink. I will find my father and escort him to the longhouse.

Id: [0x002D9DEA]
Ah, Brother! Did you forget she has Halfdan Jarl's ear? Stop talking if you know what's good for you.

Id: [0x002D9DF9]
A crypt … now tell me this is not a sign from the gods.

Id: [0x002D9DFA]
Eivor, stick his face in the horse's ass!

Id: [0x002D9DFC]
You would think, eh! Me, Halfdan, we'll be there. But Ubba … no … I do not think we are chasing the same victory. Not anymore.

Id: [0x002D9DFD]
Find him at Kinder Downfall. For the time being, he has swapped his blade for a fishing rope … to my relief.

Id: [0x002D9DFE]
Gone from my eyes for years, then back again so soon.

Id: [0x002D9DFF]
There are more people trapped within. Free them, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D9E00]
A whore? Sure, I know plenty!

Id: [0x002D9E01]
Forget I said anything!

Id: [0x002D9E02]
Forgive me, lord, this is--

Id: [0x002D9E03]
This is not something we can afford to ignore. If we do not have the means to deal with the Red Hand, we should let Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9E04]
Try the trade depot. It is where he is holding the merchants' wares.

Id: [0x002D9E05]
Uh! Get away!

Id: [0x002D9E06]
No! Stay away from me! Stay back! Agh!

Id: [0x002D9E07]
Ahh! Leave me be! Please.

Id: [0x002D9E08]
That doesn't calm me. I wanted to rip the bastard's spine out myself. You want to calm me? Start talking.

Id: [0x002D9E09]
[laugh]Dance with me, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D9E0A]
Eivor, look. Someone is setting up an outpost on that island.

Id: [0x002D9E0B]
Do you need anything else?

Id: [0x002D9E0C]
Come.

Id: [0x002D9E0D]
Describe it for me.

Id: [0x002D9E0F]
Drink…

Id: [0x002D9E10]
Steady, Eivor. It is Valka. I am here.

Id: [0x002D9E11]
Tell me everything.

Id: [0x002D9E13]
He has dogged us too long. Shamed us for too many seasons. I know this. Eivor knows this…

Id: [0x002D9E14]
Please. Try it on.

Id: [0x002D9E15]
Mentor, does Eivor intend to join us?

Id: [0x002D9E16]
How about a challenge? Leap down upon that target from above.

Id: [0x002D9E17]
Eivor, give us a hand!

Id: [0x002D9E18]
We do indeed, and we are ready to fight. King Harald's forces are well in place. Only give the word.

Id: [0x002D9E19]
That Eivor may give challenge to Kjotve at the gates of his fortress. A battle to the death in single combat.

Id: [0x002D9E1A]
Rise, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9E1B]
Rise, Eivor … and awaken.

Id: [0x002D9E1C]
Wallow in shit, Wolf-Kissed! Archers, take aim!

Id: [0x002D9E1D]
Leave Hytham. His gods watch him.

Id: [0x002D9E1E]
You are all subject to King Harald's truce. Break his peace and you will be cast out of Alrekstad.

Id: [0x002D9E1F]
Tell me Gorm still lives, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9E20]
Come in, but keep your voice down. You will alert Harald's men.

Id: [0x002D9E22]
Wasting my time. Now piss off.

Id: [0x002D9E23]
Eivor speaks for both of us, Father. You gambled your honor, and you lost your family. I hope the trade was worth it.

Id: [0x002D9E24]
Come and drink! Let us amuse the gods!

Id: [0x002D9E25]
Go on.

Id: [0x002D9E26]
What are you doing, Eivor? Picking at corpses? Get back on the ship!

Id: [0x002D9E27]
Ah! You mean to go a-viking, then! Good, good.

Id: [0x002D9E28]
Now look here! Browse what wares I have on offer.

Id: [0x002D9E29]
Wait. And watch.

Id: [0x002D9E2A]
Eivor, are you well? Eivor? Speak.

Id: [0x002D9E2B]
Yes. You remember the medallion you took from Kjotve's body? That is their symbol.

Id: [0x002D9E2C]
You desire alliances. We seek to rid England of its deepening rot.

Id: [0x002D9E2D]
Face me, Eivor!

Id: [0x002D9E2E]
That is clear. Enjoy the feast, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9E2F]
Look! This is the face of a god!

Id: [0x002D9E30]
Go. I wish to be alone. Return to my feast and drink for me. Celebrate the days to come <LF>in my name.

Id: [0x002D9E31]
Leave me be.

Id: [0x002D9E33]
Sit a moment … and rest.

Id: [0x002D9E34]
Eivor hopes to rescue Sigurd from the madwoman Fulke, now ensconced in Portcestre fortress.

Id: [0x002D9E35]
Hogging all the fun, Eivor?

Id: [0x002D9E36]
Fight hard, Eivor.

Id: [0x002D9E37]
Do not fail now, Eivor, call on Thor's strength.

Id: [0x002D9E38]
Behold his terrible beauty!

Id: [0x002D9E39]
Eivor … I will … I will fight … as a thresher through a field of wheat, Mad One.

Id: [0x002D9E3A]
You see, aetheling? Eivor understands. There can be no peace with these backward Britons.

Id: [0x002D9E3B]
Well done, drengr (courageous warrior).

Id: [0x002D9E3C]
Look here! Look upon this masterpiece!

Id: [0x002D9E3D]
No. I have something else planned. Spectacle, remember?

Id: [0x002DA022]
Pict raiders, south of the wall. Don't like it.

Id: [0x002DA023]
The Picts don't raid often during winter.

Id: [0x002DA027]
I can't get through!

Id: [0x002DA029]
The way is blocked!

Id: [0x002DA02A]

Why would the Picts make war in winter? They must have a reason, something to gain.

Id: [0x002DA040]
I should be home filling my belly, not mucking about on the wrong side of the wall.

Id: [0x002DA041]
Ah, boil your head. We'll gang forth with our friends soon, and then we'll all eat like kings. Heed my words.

Id: [0x002DA042]
Wrong side of the wall.

Id: [0x002DA04B]
The third crate of mine taken this week, and with no explanation.

Id: [0x002DA04C]
Rules are rules, but I wish they would tell us why.

Id: [0x002DA04E]
I cannot wait for the Yuletide feast! Snow, wine, food… It truly is the best time of the year!

Id: [0x002DA04F]
Have you gotten gifts for your family yet?

Id: [0x002DA051]
Keep your coin pouch close to you, there are pocket thieves around lately.

Id: [0x002DA052]
Huh! They can try.

Id: [0x002DA056]
This cauldron is enormous! How did they get it in here? And how might I get it out?

Eivor … first one to Burgred gets to string him up by his dangly man-wattle. Then jab him in his fat head.

Id: [0x002DA15C]
We have the same father, Eivor. But his mother was a sow.

Id: [0x002DA15D]
Take care of yourself, Eivor. The world is a dangerous place.

Id: [0x002DA15E]
Careful, Eivor! These supplies bring fire to the Ulkerthorpe siege.

Id: [0x002DA15F]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA160]
Eivor … wait a moment.

Id: [0x002DA161]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA162]
Thank you … thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA163]
Yes. Thank you, Vili. Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA164]
Eivor, let my first decree be Hemming's wish. An alliance between our people. When you call, we will rise.

Id: [0x002DA165]
I am only glad you were not harmed. Eivor, I will be around if you need me.

Id: [0x002DA166]
Well done, Eivor. Who was hiding behind the name--

Id: [0x002DA167]
Eivor! Over here!

Id: [0x002DA168]
Impressive enough to join?

Id: [0x002DA169]
Eivor. Have we not said our farewells?

Id: [0x002DA16B]
Need to get that brain working quicker, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA16C]
Think on your feet, Eivor. Saying nothing is like leaving yourself open for a blow!

Id: [0x002DA16E]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA16F]
Eivor, shall we have a duel of words?

Id: [0x002DA170]
Eivor … Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA171]
Hello, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA172]
I will finish it when we are certain to win, Eivor. And that day is fast approaching.

Id: [0x002DA174]
And now, I have returned! With riches and glory to share with my family, my friends, my ice-forged drengir!

Id: [0x002DA175]
[laugh]Gah! You would put Thor to shame!

Id: [0x002DA176]
Eivor. Let us walk to the docks and take in the night air.

Id: [0x002DA177]
Leave all that aside, Eivor. Tonight we are family again.

Id: [0x002DA178]
Gods, Eivor, what happened?

Id: [0x002DA179]
Eivor, destroy those wagons.

Id: [0x002DA17A]
I must strongly disagree, Eivor. This is a gift from the gods.

Id: [0x002DA17B]
Eivor, a word.

Id: [0x002DA17C]
Eivor! Gorm fled into the church!

Id: [0x002DA17D]
Eivor! The breath-of-battle rises from my brow! The skalds will sing of this night!

Id: [0x002DA17E]
Not tonight, Eivor. Leave it.

Id: [0x002DA17F]
Hold, Eivor. Let it play out.

Id: [0x002DA181]
Eivor, the wind favors us! We should set sail without delay.

Id: [0x002DA182]
Styrbjorn Jarl! Our men were killed as we patrolled nearby. And the word is … Eivor swung the axe.

Id: [0x002DA183]
An ocean lies before us, Eivor. And on its far side, a new kingdom awaits.

Id: [0x002DA184]
May I man the alliance table for Eivor next time? Get a bit of practice in.

Id: [0x002DA185]
Rest assured, Eivor, the settlement is in safe hands.

Id: [0x002DA186]
Good, good. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA187]
We live in a strange time, Eivor. Among stranger people.

Id: [0x002DA188]
The chain is away! Eivor, back to the boat!

Id: [0x002DA189]
Eivor! We need to leave!

Id: [0x002DA18A]
Fine work, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA18B]
A good find, Eivor. Let's have a word.

Id: [0x002DA18C]
Eivor … look at this

Id: [0x002DA18D]
Eivor. Sigurd. I give you England … and its four kingdoms.

Id: [0x002DA18E]
Not a bad place, Eivor. Not at all!

Id: [0x002DA18F]
Eivor. Look there. A monastery.

Id: [0x002DA190]
Freyja's bounty! We must take this one, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA191]
Eivor! That way, a monastery!

Id: [0x002DA192]
Eivor, hello.

Id: [0x002DA193]
Ah! This is wonderful, Eivor! A forge bigger and hotter than my old forge back in Fornberg.

Id: [0x002DA194]
Eivor, in here.

Id: [0x002DA195]
Morning, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA196]
Farewell, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA197]
No, Dag, you belong here with the raiders. And you will act as Eivor commands.

Id: [0x002DA198]
[scoff]Do as Eivor commands? Is he testing me?

Id: [0x002DA199]
Salve, Eivor! Ad meliora! (Towards better things!)

Id: [0x002DA19A]
I would be grateful. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA19B]
Eivor, please build my bureau.

Id: [0x002DA19C]
It would be greatly be appreciated if you could give me housing

Id: [0x002DA19D]
This will make a fine space for my work, Eivor. Thank you.

Id: [0x002DA19E]
Eivor, would you mind coming aboard?

Id: [0x002DA19F]
A perfect fall. And how did it feel?

Id: [0x002DA1A1]
He begs for death, Eivor! Give it to him.

Id: [0x002DA1A2]
Eivor, I could have sent my scouts to follow him home. We might have learned something.

Id: [0x002DA1A3]
Eivor, thank Tyr.

Id: [0x002DA1A4]
It does. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA1A5]
Hear me, all! I challenge Eivor for the leadership of this clan until Sigurd is safe home!

Id: [0x002DA1A6]
Eivor! Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA1A7]
Please. Please, both of you!

Id: [0x002DA1A8]
I was tested, Eivor. In a crucible of blood and fire. And in my agony, I was reborn.

Id: [0x002DA1A9]
My motives were honest, Eivor. Would a thief be so brazen as to display the fruits of his crime? Hardly.

Id: [0x002DA1AA]
I have been robbed, Eivor. My property defaced. Three days ago, I discovered some of my sailcloth missing.

Id: [0x002DA1AB]
Eivor, please … does this not seem unfair?

Id: [0x002DA1AC]
Steady, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA1AD]
Eivor … Sigurd.

Id: [0x002DA1AE]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002DA1AF]
Eivor's returned! Inside, at the hearth! Come!

Id: [0x002DA1B0]
When we meet again, Eivor. May it be as friends.

Id: [0x002DA1B1]
I advise. Sigurd and Eivor devise. But yes, it happens right here.

Id: [0x002DA1B2]
Not to interrupt, Eivor, but what of Ledecestrescire?

Id: [0x002DA1B3]
You will be back in Northwic soon enough, Broder. Vengeance will put fire to Eivor's heels.

Id: [0x002DA1B4]
Eivor has brought many allies together from all over the land.

Id: [0x002DA1B5]
With mighty Eivor at our head, we cannot fail!

Id: [0x002DA1B6]
That's the way, Eivor! For glory, and for Odin!

Id: [0x002DA1B7]
He is dead, Eivor. No breath within him. Gods, I've never seen the raucous bastard so quiet.

Id: [0x002DA1B8]
Eivor…

Thank you, Eivor. I will do what I can.

Id: [0x002DA1BB]
Here they come! Stand fast, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA1BC]
Eivor! Help me!

Id: [0x002DA1BD]
It may be that one day our paths lead us to doom, Eivor. But at least we can say the footprints we left were our own.

Id: [0x002DA1BE]
Eivor. Dark news. We found a letter on one of the dead. Fulke has called for aid.

Id: [0x002DA1BF]
For Eivor! For Sigurd!

Id: [0x002DA1C0]
Ubba! Do you have sight of Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA1C1]
We are all in the dark, Eivor. It is the search for the light that brings us closer to the gods.

Id: [0x002DA1C2]
You are too late, Eivor. I have opened your brother's mind to the truth. That is my victory.

Id: [0x002DA1C3]
Eivor! We delayed them as long as we could.

Id: [0x002DA1C4]
You are better off leaving that sauntering pole in your wake.

Id: [0x002DA1C5]
I am not a patient man, Eivor. Put these dogs down quietly, or I may just join you the way I did in Ledecestre.

Id: [0x002DA1C6]
Eivor, here comes Ynyr! He's roiling in like a winter sea!

Id: [0x002DA1C7]
Join us, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA1C8]
Eivor! Did you see Ceolbert fight? He is all balls now.

Id: [0x002DA1C9]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DA1CA]
Now, Eivor! Set it ablaze!

Id: [0x002DA1CB]
Eivor! Do not forget that load of rotten flesh called Rhodri.

Id: [0x002DA1CC]
We are not finished, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DA1CD]
This is a life, Eivor! To fight high above the world. Valhalla awaits!

Id: [0x002DA1CE]
Do not shame me, Eivor! Finish me well.

Id: [0x002DA1CF]
Come down, Eivor! I have only begun to enjoy this!

Id: [0x002DA1D0]
My axe, Eivor. Hand me my weapon.

Id: [0x002DA1D1]
Eivor! Give it here…!

Id: [0x002DA1D2]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002DA1D3]
You're wonderful!

Id: [0x002DA1D4]
Ooo, you missed bad!

Id: [0x002DA1D7]
It is not about worth, Eivor. It is a matter of devotion to our creed. And … and training.

Id: [0x002DA1D8]
Welcome home.

Id: [0x002DA1D9]
Do I trust my own eyes? Is that truly who I see?

Id: [0x002DA6E7]
Make it quick. Meet me in the marketplace when you are done.

Id: [0x002DA6E8]
There may be more wine in my private stores, I'll send a man to retrieve it. Is there anything else?

Id: [0x002DA6E9]
No, Heaven forfend. In spite of your … invasive introduction to England, you have treated me and my father with kindness.

Id: [0x002DA6EA]
How did it feel?

Id: [0x002DA6EB]
Back so soon? And with good news, I hope.

Id: [0x002DA6EC]
Please, just wait. Until Eivor comes, we cannot settle this.

Id: [0x002DA6ED]
Peace, Guthrum. It is Fulke who merits your wrath, not Eivor.

Come on, all of you! Kill the traitor!

Id: [0x002DBB75]
You dare to steal the royal treasure! Guards! Guards!

Id: [0x002DBB7A]
Bow! Why won't you bow to your king?

Id: [0x002DBB7B]
How dare you look at me like that! Show respect to your liege!

Id: [0x002DBB7C]
You! Serf! Bring me ale!

Id: [0x002DBB7D]
That's the last time I go chasing rabbits. Especially white ones. Now, just a little rest, and I'll be ready for more adventures!

Id: [0x002DBB7F]
Hunting? No! He just seemed, well, in a hurry. I wanted to see where he was going.

I give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it.

Stay there, girl. I will help you out.

O, Alisa. You silly, silly girl.

Id: [0x002DBB95]
Can anybody hear me? Help!

Id: [0x002DBB96]
Get away! You will not have it! This is the king's property!

Id: [0x002DBB97]
You can take all the treasures of Canterbury, but you won't have this!

Id: [0x002DBB98]
Norse scum! You can rot out there!

Id: [0x002DBB99]
I'm not coming out. And you're not coming in!

Id: [0x002DBB9B]
Spare me your sullen words! My heart is torn. Go, find something useful to do.

Id: [0x002DBBA4]
Forgive me, Gerhild. But even now, there are some who will. You should make yourself scarce for a while.

Id: [0x002DBBD7]
Brigid and Gunnar have already gone ahead. I should join them.

Id: [0x002DBBDE]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002DBBE0]
And when I have them, I will put them to good use. To find my children. And bring my family back together.

Id: [0x002DBBE5]
Was it a mass exodus from Norway then?

Id: [0x002DBBE6]
It was. Norway is now the province of a young king. Harald by name, a boy wise beyond his years.

Id: [0x002DBBE7]
Are you not angry that he has displaced you and so many others?

Id: [0x002DBBE8]
I was … for a time. But our weeks at sea have softened my brow-fire. If I am honest, I realize I quite admire King Harald.

Id: [0x002DBBE9]
By words and by weapons both, he has pacified the country I call home.

Id: [0x002DBBEA]
For the first time in any man's memory or any skald's song, Norway has one king. Just one. And that is quite a feat.

Id: [0x002DBBEB]
That is impressive, truly. England is half the size of Norway, and yet we have four kings for our four kingdoms.

Id: [0x002DBBEC]
You see? How could I not be impressed? No, Harald is a good man with grand ideas. I can see that now.

Id: [0x002DBBED]
In truth, Ceolbert, it is my father who bears the heaviest weight of my anger. Not King Harald.

Id: [0x002DBBEE]
My father gifted my birthright to Harald without my consent or knowledge, as easily as if he might hand over a barrel of mead.

Id: [0x002DBBEF]
It was not merely a deception, it was a betrayal of trust. The prick of which still stings me.

Id: [0x002DBBF0]
Be it a blessing or a curse, family is always first.

Id: [0x002DBBF1]
A good line, boy. Were you not an aetheling, I would hire you as my skald.

Id: [0x002DBBF2]
Skald … it sounds something like Scop, our court poets. Is that what you mean?

Id: [0x002DBBF3]
Right again.

Id: [0x002DBBF4]
Fascinating. The harmony between our words and yours is quite something.

Id: [0x002DBBF5]
As if we were distant cousins, separated by an ocean of time as well as space.

Id: [0x002DBBF6]
[laugh]I like the thought of that, I do!

Danish raiders! Save our lady!

Id: [0x002DBC65]
We are here.

Id: [0x002DBC78]
Walk with me, Eivor. I would welcome some company now.

Id: [0x002DBC7A]
Are you not? Dark news, dark deeds. My heart burns for vengeance, but what will it bring? I will be a king on a throne of skulls.

Id: [0x002DBC7C]
And will the battle end then? It is in our bones and blood. If violence is the way to Valhalla, how can there ever be peace?

Id: [0x002DBC7E]
That is the question I have been asking myself. And yet there must be another way. There has to be.

Id: [0x002DBC7F]
You are troubled, Guthrum.

Another matter that needs my attention. I will meet you at the camp.

All is ready, and your allies have arrived. Speak to them if you like. I'll be here when you're done.

Back to the fray!

Id: [0x002DBCC4]
Eivor, could you spare a moment?

Id: [0x002DBCCA]
I am, have no worry. It is only prolonged stresses that exhaust me. My energy runs low rather quickly.

Id: [0x002DBCCB]
Are you well enough to steer this boat?

Ah, thank you!

Ah. Back to it!

I am only six years his junior, and have yet to see my first battle. I cannot imagine the skill and cunning he has.

Your first battle is coming, young Ceolbert. From this day on, you may see rapid progress.

Thank you, stranger, I thought this was my last day on Midgard.

Really, papa? You always told me to be wary of men who give freely.

Aye, Son, but he is no mere man. He is a jarl amongst jarls. A man of honor to whom we owe much.

Here, Eivor. This was where Vili saw the scout killed and then charged after the enemy ahead.

Id: [0x002DBD78]
No one can live up to Hemming Jarl, but I will do my best to serve in his stead.

Id: [0x002DBD7B]
Thank you, Eivor. I entrust Vili to you.

Id: [0x002DBD7D]
Thank you for all you have done, Eivor. In my mind, this version of my life, one as a jarl, was clouded with fear of disappointment. Of shackles.

Id: [0x002DBD7F]
But seeing you as a leader in your own right … inspires me to do the same. Farewell, old friend.

Did you see what happened to the house where they kept the voda? It has gone up in flames!

Id: [0x002DBD98]
They are going to kill him! I told him not to do it. Now he's locked up in that house with no way out.

Id: [0x002DBD99]
That Saxon did what? How dare he insult our culture! He is a dead man if I ever get my hands on him.

Aye, the burden is Vili's to bear. But … the lad never wanted it. I am not sure what is to happen.

Id: [0x002DBDE0]
Aye, if only our meeting were to take place during a more joyous occasion.

Id: [0x002DBDE2]
Not as well as I would have liked. But he was a fine warrior, and an honest man. One I could trust. And I trust [beat]very few. To Hemming Jarl, Skal.

I have heard numerous tales now of a secret codex circulating among the acolytes of our bureaus, both within and without the empire of Augustus.

Id: [0x002DC7B7]
Called the Magas Codex, it names you directly as one of the founders of the Hidden Ones.

Id: [0x002DC7B8]
Apart from putting your life in danger, it flies in the face of what we have tried to achieve with our brotherhood.

Id: [0x002DC7B9]
We are justice seekers who shun the light of praise for our good works, and who must live in the shadows of our triumphs.

Id: [0x002DC7BA]
Should you see any pages of this codex, I advise you to destroy them. Keep the dream of our Hidden Ones alive.

Id: [0x002DC7BB]
Now I am not so naïve to think this will be a simple task.

Id: [0x002DC7BC]
Few men and women are suited to keeping such secrets for so long, and it may be that we will fail in the end.

Id: [0x002DCC75]
Eivor! Be careful!

Id: [0x002DCC76]
You widowed my destiny, Wolf-Kissed! You broke all my hopes!

Id: [0x002DCC77]
How long have you been chasing me, Wolf-Kissed? Seventeen winters? Eighteen?

Id: [0x002DCC78]
You will live your final days enthralled as a slave, humiliated. Your death will be a lonely one.

Id: [0x002DCC79]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed is no more! That name is dead to this world!

Id: [0x002DCC7A]
Kjotve will skin you alive! You will never … never leave this--

Id: [0x002DCC7B]
You have a keen eye, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002DCC7C]
Well enough, butcher.

Id: [0x002DCC7D]
And so you have returned, Eivor Raven-Feeder. But we have nothing left to say.

Id: [0x002DCC7E]
You! The Dane who did all the … the saving of Tewdwr. And, dare I say a spirit once?

Id: [0x002DCC7F]
Such wisdom behind young eyes. You have lived a life or two I see, friend?

Id: [0x002DCC80]
No. I've been kidnapped, beaten, and almost sacrificed to an old god. Does that qualify me to court a Dane?

Id: [0x002DCC81]
You're the first I've given myself to, Eivor. I always promised that it would be with someone who filled my heart and soul.

Id: [0x002DCC82]
If you must. Safe travels, my friend.

Id: [0x002DCC83]
Ahh! You must be Eivor? Tewdwr, I see you've welcomed our honored guest! Come just in time for my last Samhain!

Id: [0x002DCC84]
So you've come to meet the family? Before you whisk my Brigid away to her life as a smithy's bride?

Id: [0x002DCC85]
I see I'm outmatched. Though a Dane joining in praise to Saint Kenhelm? God will weep.

Id: [0x002DCC86]
(unintelligible)[Odd. That path is usually safe. Are you injured?]

Id: [0x002DCC87]
Eivor, mighty warrior, knocker of doors, victor of cakes. How does it feel to pillage what is freely given?

Id: [0x002DCC88]
Come on lad, show the Dane yer mettle.

Id: [0x002DCC89]
Eivor, speak true … my feelings be damned. I have been an arse, do not deny it. And I for that … I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002DCC8A]
Soft words from a heartless heathen!

Id: [0x002DCC8B]
I think I might like you even better when you're mean.

Id: [0x002DCC8C]
O! Yes. My first ally as ealdorman. [puffing out his chest]I accept! We shall make an oath! [beat]How do we start?

Id: [0x002DCC8D]
With Tewdwr gone, Glowecestre will be without an ealdorman. Eye for an eye, your Raven Clan will lose their chieftain.

Id: [0x002DCC8E]
Get the murderer!

Id: [0x002DCC8F]
Very odd. How bad did it look for you to have your name so besmirched?

Id: [0x002DCC90]
I will. Thor be with you, my friend.

Id: [0x002DCC91]
Mother, it's the friend of the mangled-leg man!

Id: [0x002DCC92]
Search the houses! Can't have gotten far!

Id: [0x002DCC93]
They're coming for you. If they know I've aided you, it'll be my head next.

Id: [0x002DCC94]
Mother, if the stranger wants more of the herbs, they can talk to the Druid Halewyn?

Id: [0x002DCC95]
If you be mortal, I will not speak to you. I am waiting for the spirit, they come, they come.

Id: [0x002DCC96]
Guards! Someone save me! A murderous Dane is here to sever my head from my neck.

Id: [0x002DCC97]
You could have told me of your plight earlier. We are both friends of Brigid, and I know you would do nothing to jeopardize your friend.

Id: [0x002DCC98]
The old gods whisper in these stones. I've had my fill of their secrets. Tell me when you are ready to leave.

Id: [0x002DCC99]
Are you ready to depart?

Id: [0x002DCC9A]
Eivor! You're alive!

Id: [0x002DCC9B]
O gods, is he dead? Wake up! Wake up! Tell the Dane I've hand-fed ye like a baby sparrow.

Id: [0x002DCC9C]
Thank you, stranger!

Id: [0x002DCC9D]
You are resolute then.[steadies herself] Then may you ride as Rhiannon.

Id: [0x002DCC9E]
It's you again. The Samhain Butcher!

Id: [0x002DCC9F]
Your loss, Butcher.

Id: [0x002DCCA0]
Ha! Didn't take much to outwit me. You're really good, good enough for a reward.

Id: [0x002DCCA1]
O! That unholy visage startled me. It's past sundown, so Cynon has retired to the church for prayer.

Id: [0x002DCCA2]
Shit.[beat] Prophecy is a strange web, is it not? Tewdwr's reformation just needed a kidnapping and a dedicated Dane.

Id: [0x002DCCA3]
I have much to attend to here, otherwise I'd lead you myself. Go now,[joking] unless you plan on killing me first?

Id: [0x002DCCA4]
And I shall give it. You are a great warrior, conqueror of this land, and that of your birth.

Id: [0x002DCCA5]
And you, Eivor, friend of Glowecestrescire. You have lived up to your reputation.

Id: [0x002DCCA6]
Punishment or not, you will go into the future as Glowecestrescire's ally.

Id: [0x002DCCA7]
And a dear friend, O Legendary warrior, Eivor Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002DCCA8]
You're not so smart.

Id: [0x002DCCA9]
You're a tricky one, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DCCAA]
You are welcome to this family. Now we will grow together, and feast together, and scamper over the snows together.

Id: [0x002DCCAB]
You are mad. What did I say?

Id: [0x002DCCAC]
You demon-plowing dog!

Id: [0x002DCCAD]
The guilty have come for spoils.

Id: [0x002DCCAE]
Was our dignity not enough? You return again to mock our family? To make light of my father's sacrifice?

Id: [0x002DCCAF]
Which of the traitor kings sent you? Was it Edmund? Burgred? Aella?

Id: [0x002DCCB0]
You dare intrude? You will be skinned like the others.

Id: [0x002DCCB1]
You have done well warrior, lasting this long.

Id: [0x002DCCB2]
And Eivor here, carried off to be sold into slavery, a fate worse than a fine death. But there is one fact you do not know!

Id: [0x002DCCB3]
Upon my return from Francia, I heard the news. Kjotve the Cruel is long dead. Slain by the hand of Eivor, the Wolf-Kissed one.

Id: [0x002DCCB4]
Other names but mine ring on the tongues of the skalds. Halfdan, Ubba, Guthrum. [mock resentment]And Eivor the Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002DCCB5]
Drink of the brew that bubbles here in my pot. Then we will enter the frenzy together, and only one of us will leave.

Id: [0x002DCCB6]
I am glad you have returned. A true drengr does not run. We continue the journey. But we must take the ritual formula.

Id: [0x002DCCB7]
Good warrior, you carry yourself with the spirit of a drengr. I am a drengr too.

Id: [0x002DCCB8]
If you are a true drengr, a warrior with honor running like sunlight in your veins, then you may help me fulfill my destiny.

Id: [0x002DCCB9]
I did not die beside my lord in Aella's pit of snakes. But I can make amends. Fight me, warrior. Send me to meet him in Odin's hall.

Id: [0x002DCCBA]
You are a true drengr. Ragnar would have liked you!

Id: [0x002DCCBB]
Stand fast, warrior. And if Loki rules the day, you may have a chance.

Id: [0x002DCCBC]
Good stranger! Thank you for your help. I heard what happened!

Id: [0x002DCCBD]
Then you will not be disappointed! However, be warned. This beast is quick to bite, and fearless.

Id: [0x002DCCBE]
O God, a poet, just like me. Yes! Yes! Your entry will be free.

Id: [0x002DCCBF]
Ah, back again, hm? Ready for more?

Id: [0x002DCCC0]
Are you ready?

Id: [0x002DCCC1]
It seems to me you've proven to be champion of the BBB.

Id: [0x002DCCC2]
You answered the midnight call and you took a towering fall. But return to me again if you dare re-enter this den.

Id: [0x002DCCC3]
BBB! BBB! I see you there, brawler! Keep those fists up, you never know!

Id: [0x002DCCC4]
Step back, Dane. I am sworn to this lady, and unafraid to kill the likes of you!

Id: [0x002DCCC5]
I told you to leave, Dane rat! The lady is mine!

Id: [0x002DCCC6]
A courageous traveler has come to my rescue! Please, Lord, guide their hand!

Id: [0x002DCCC7]
And you risked your own … you, o, you are so brave. A fine protector.

Id: [0x002DCCC8]
I need a protector, stout and resolute! Please, stand guard below.

Id: [0x002DCCC9]
Are you still there? My savior? O dear…

Id: [0x002DCCCA]
No! You wicked devil! I told you not to do that!

Id: [0x002DCCCB]
We await the Lord of Crowland, trespasser. Leave or die!

Id: [0x002DCCCC]
Insolent ferret! Kill this usurper!

Id: [0x002DCCCD]
Don't let this one escape!

Id: [0x002DCCCE]
Don't say I didn't warn you. The disappointment you will feel, I also feel.

Id: [0x002DCCCF]
You have returned to face the wallop again? O boy, o boy…

Id: [0x002DCCD0]
Over here, good warrior.

Id: [0x002DCCD1]
You there, Dane! Who deserves more, the worker who makes the barley or he who actually sells it?

Id: [0x002DCCD2]
This Dane speaks nonsense!

Id: [0x002DCCD3]
No, no, I appreciate a stranger understanding injustice. More silver should line my pockets for my hard work!

Id: [0x002DCCD4]
I'm sure if this stranger knew the truth, they would side with me. I toil over the ale-barrel! "Sebbi's Slush" is from great barley.

Id: [0x002DCCD5]
Yes, they have. But I hope that has changed, thanks to your intervention … even if it was … drastic. Thank you.

Id: [0x002DCCD6]
Sis, this nice stranger bought our goats.

Id: [0x002DCCD7]
Here, it's yours. I hope it will keep you warm on your travels! Goodbye, nice stranger!

Id: [0x002DCCD8]
O, you are temptation-wrapped redemption, stranger.[beat] I have missed the dice dearly. Perhaps God has other plans…

Id: [0x002DCCD9]
With fresh poems bestowed on me by a new muse. One with the heart of a warrior and eyes of frost.

Id: [0x002DCCDA]
Then you'll just have to return with more coin, Dane.

Id: [0x002DCCDB]
Olaf, you lifeless fool! You almost murdered our rescuer!

Id: [0x002DCCDC]
Halt in your search! A winner, and my comb has been found.

Id: [0x002DCCDD]
You are different than the kind my flights of fancy attract. Burdened, decorated and … delicate.

Id: [0x002DCCDE]
You keep it. It was a reward for my champion. Farewell.

Id: [0x002DCCDF]
Look at you. A battle-hardened vikingr! Just what we need.

Id: [0x002DCCE0]
Well, you are free to visit us again. Till we meet the next!

Id: [0x002DCCE1]
Welcome, friend, to our neck of the woods! You are free to join us any time.

Id: [0x002DCCE2]
Owooo! [war cry]Greetings, friend! We're here to lend you our steel!

Id: [0x002DCCE3]
Whoa! You're really good at this!

Id: [0x002DCCE4]
You there! Dane! Come and be saved!

Id: [0x002DCCE5]
Can you smell brimstone? Better join us while you can, heathen!

Id: [0x002DCCE6]
Welcome, heathen. Praise God, who has brought you here to join us.

Id: [0x002DCCE7]
Cease your blasphemy! You have been summoned by God to be baptized! Submit or pay the price!

Id: [0x002DCCE8]
Sinner! Die at the hands of Faith!

Id: [0x002DCCE9]
O, stranger! Here's a tale. I love Ethelind,  a hunter's daughter. But the hunter's a fearsome fellow. Set me a task, he did.

Id: [0x002DCCEA]
You got the arrow! Praise be to you, stranger! Bring it back, won't you?

Id: [0x002DCCEB]
O, thank you, stranger! I'll name our firstborn in your honor, swear I will! Er … what is your name?

Id: [0x002DCCEC]
You there, Dane! Come join your fellows! Music is my gift to you all!

Id: [0x002DCCED]
Traveler! You have strayed onto cursed ground. Your life is in peril.

Id: [0x002DCCEE]
Give up your treasures and we will release you from the fog!

Id: [0x002DCCEF]
They've found us, lads. No sudden moves, all right?

Id: [0x002DCCF0]
That's a fine idea! We'll do it! Here, you deserve a few coins for your help, at least. Thanks, traveler!

Id: [0x002DCCF2]
You have my thanks, Dane. Take your reward and leave us. [beat]Plow me, soft one, scythe the weeds from my field.

Id: [0x002DCCF3]
Thank you, stranger, you have given me a glimpse of a sweeter life. This was hers, take it, for it saddens me to look on.

Id: [0x002DCCF4]
You came back!

Id: [0x002DCCF5]
I am glad you stopped by. It brought me some comfort.

Id: [0x002DCCF6]
Have no doubt, He Who Walks Backwards is among us. Either he will come out of there, or we will go in.

Id: [0x002DCCF7]
Have a care, stranger! Do not speak to him! Your immortal soul is in peril!

Id: [0x002DCCF8]
Have you slain him? Or has the Devil's tongue swayed you?

Id: [0x002DCCF9]
Another who commands the beasts! The Devil's spawn is among us! Flee!

Id: [0x002DCCFA]
Ha! That'll keep 'em away. You are beast-friend. Eawynn likes you. Bye-bye.

Id: [0x002DCCFB]
You would volunteer?[beat] Ah! You are a lover of fine music, this is surely an omen!

Id: [0x002DCCFC]
Take a breath, all that vitriol can kill a man!

Id: [0x002DCCFD]
Ah, a stranger! Come listen to my story.

Id: [0x002DCCFE]
Wayfarer! I'm dead. I'm so dead!

Id: [0x002DCCFF]
Help me, wayfarer, or you'll see me in your dreams! I'm warning you! In your dreams, I said!

Id: [0x002DCD00]
I'm stuck in purgatory. Have a heart, wayfarer, give a little something to help free me.

Id: [0x002DCD01]
What about it, wayfarer? Are you listening? I'm a dead man!

Id: [0x002DCD02]
I don't have all day, wayfarer. You should know, the dead do not have an abundance of patience!

Id: [0x002DCD03]
Wayfarer? Where are you going! Get back here!

Id: [0x002DCD04]
Ah! Now I can rest in peace in the land of the dead and all that. You can go, wayfarer. Go ahead. No need to stay!

Id: [0x002DCD05]
Hello, stranger.

Id: [0x002DCD06]
O, you are lucky to be here, warrior! You'll see a sight rarely seen by any mortals!

Id: [0x002DCD07]
The name's Otta Sluggasson. I usually try to dodge Danes like yourself, but you seem friendly.

Id: [0x002DCD08]
I like this Viking. Kids, gather round! [turns to Eivor]Are you sure you want to challenge me?

Id: [0x002DCD09]
The Dane's got a fine shot! Two legends here together! Tell the poets!

Id: [0x002DCD0A]
Thank you! O, thank you, stranger! I shall call you Sunshine, for you broke through the clouds of my loneliness.

Id: [0x002DCD0B]
The wandering poet! Hullo again!

Id: [0x002DCD0C]
You need not help me, but who am I to look a gift Dane in the mouth.

Id: [0x002DCD0D]
I doubt he will. I ran after our little encounter.[beat] Thank you, love, you have been kinder to me than my own kin.

Id: [0x002DCD0E]
Friend, I soon will sleep in the comforting arms of the Lord. Can you please look after my widdle doggie-dog?

Id: [0x002DCD0F]
Bless you, I die in peace. Goodbye, my Dandy-Dandy-dooooooo…[dies]

Id: [0x002DCD10]
Good fellow! I've locked myself out!

Id: [0x002DCD11]
Friend, I've lost my key.

Id: [0x002DCD12]
Ah, a Dane! I have an object inside that you'd be interested in - the legendary horn of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002DCD13]
Well done, friend!

Id: [0x002DCD14]
Thieves! You filthy Dane, get out of my house!

Id: [0x002DCD15]
Friend, it's all a simple misunderstanding.

Id: [0x002DCD16]
If you were indeed deceived, Dane, you'll return my bibelot and help me kill this villain.

Id: [0x002DCD17]
Bless you, Dane!

Id: [0x002DCD18]
You've helped me, Dane. I will not send you before the magistrate for robbery. I trust you are grateful.

Id: [0x002DCD19]
He bragged about that object all over the village. Keep it, friend. You deserve it.

Id: [0x002DCD1A]
I don't have any on hand. To brew this elixir involves great risk. You must be certain you are up for the challenge.

Id: [0x002DCD1B]
As for the lichen, you can find some growing in the well outside. Be careful.

Id: [0x002DCD1C]
You stumbled out of here, then began sprinting across this forest as if you had a nose for something. Very feral.

Id: [0x002DCD1D]
Look! This stranger has helped us!

Id: [0x002DCD1E]
Hah! This one takes us for a fool, Brother. We Sons of Ragnar have this well under control.

Id: [0x002DCD1F]
And worry not, budding Sprout. Together, we will grow you into a fine warrior.

Id: [0x002DCD20]
Stand back, Sprout, and observe. You may learn a thing or two!

Id: [0x002DCD21]
Gods! Mother's axe! It is inside![to Eivor] Please, stranger, you must get it back for us! Find a way in!

Id: [0x002DCD22]
You deaf?

Id: [0x002DCD23]
But you are not from that Ragnarsson camp there, in Repton. I would have recognized you.

Id: [0x002DCD24]
Ah! You've come back. Why are you wasting your time with me?

Id: [0x002DCD25]
Take what you want, heathen. Just leave us be.

Id: [0x002DCD26]
The Lord sent me a shepherd to help lead my flock today. Thank you. You did not have to do what you did.

Id: [0x002DCD27]
You! That was flawless. You fought with fervor! The likes of which I have not seen since Stikla here was a young raider herself.

Id: [0x002DCD28]
Thank you, young warrior. We built this fishing village with our own hands before it was taken from us.

Id: [0x002DCD29]
We won't. Thank you, stranger. Farewell!

Id: [0x002DCD2A]
What concern is this to you, heathen?

Id: [0x002DCD2B]
Thanks for saving my neck, stranger. I pray I can return the favor someday.

Id: [0x002DCD2C]
Dear friend, relax your body and cast away your loins!

Id: [0x002DCD2D]
A fair Dane joins the ranks of the liberated!

Id: [0x002DCD2E]
Greetings, Dane. This is our private celebration of skin. We are open to all who strip. Would you join us?

Id: [0x002DCD2F]
Our clothes! Leave them, stop it thief! Garb thief!

Id: [0x002DCD30]
Let the Dane go! Someone we know in society will see us! Quick, find shelter!

Id: [0x002DCD31]
I knew you were one of us. Dance with us Dane, dance!

Id: [0x002DCD32]
Shoo Shoo! Stay away from my castle. Away from my brood. My sweet feline kin. Shoo, you big old Dane!

Id: [0x002DCD33]
My Queen! To me! An invader threatens our citizens.

Id: [0x002DCD34]
Welcome to my kingdom, wandering lord! I seek an alliance, one to benefit us both!

Id: [0x002DCD35]
Now, I blind you with blood, usurper!

Id: [0x002DCD36]
By all that is great, I cannot believe my eyes and ears! Now, you are pledged to the Kingdom of Norsexe! That will show him.

Id: [0x002DCD37]
Thank you. As you are pledged to me, I am pledged to you. If ever I have an army to lend, you may make use of it.

Id: [0x002DCD38]
Nothing! The arm-ring is mine. Mine! This kingdom was to be one of the greatest in England. The ring-shine has blinded you!

Id: [0x002DCD39]
O, I beg to differ, my friend! You see, every year we make the pilgrimage to the west, Hamme's farm.

Id: [0x002DCD3A]
Sharing an apple with a friend is the most sublime experience … O![ecstasy noise]

Id: [0x002DCD3B]
Heathen! This is a place for proud converts like myself.

Id: [0x002DCD3C]
You seem lost and homeless. Make of mine what you will. You could burn it to the ground, and it will not change me.

Id: [0x002DCD3D]
I gave you a chance, heathen! I am a better, richer man for what I did. I changed course, and…

Id: [0x002DCD3E]
Be careful in there, stranger! The smell could kill you!

Id: [0x002DCD3F]
Only time will tell. Be well, stranger.

Id: [0x002DCD40]
Eew! [spotting Eivor and Hurrey]Careful, that Dane's back with Hurrey.

Id: [0x002DCD41]
The earth's beauty renews us. Thank you, stranger. My life begins anew.

Id: [0x002DCD42]
Can it-- can it-- can it be? Huh… If so, it was worth it. One last raid. Thank you, my friend.

Id: [0x002DCD43]
Walter, we got the fish! Thank you, stranger!

Id: [0x002DCD44]
You are a vikingr, as am I. Perhaps if you gave me leave, I would water the earth with a storm of tears to soften the pain.

Id: [0x002DCD45]
You've returned, vikingr. Are you here at long last to give me leave to weep?

Id: [0x002DCD46]
I'm blind, you idiot!

Id: [0x002DCD47]
Unless … Unless you lead me there. Dear Lord, yes! Walk loudly, friend. I'll follow wherever you go.

Id: [0x002DCD48]
O, god. You're lost, aren't you? We're nowhere near Clee Hill Spring, right? I knew this was a mistake.

Id: [0x002DCD49]
Ah! Sorry, friend. I questioned the Lord in a moment of weakness. I crawled this far, but it seems I will never get to Clee Hill.

Id: [0x002DCD4A]
What? Are you going to take me to Clee Hill Spring? O, thank you, stranger! It is a joyous day![laugh]

Id: [0x002DCD4B]
Make haste, O stranger! For I am eager to walk again! Once more know the joy of striding across a grassy knoll on a summer's day!

Id: [0x002DCD4C]
Who are you, stranger? Someone doing penance? A Samaritan? An angel sent from on high?

Id: [0x002DCD4D]
[exerts]Wait. This isn't Clee Hill Spring. Not at all. Do not abandon me, stranger!

Id: [0x002DCD4E]
Would you please stick a cork in it for two minutes!

Id: [0x002DCD4F]
Ah! Heaven-sent joy! [to Eivor]O! All because of this Dane! Thank you, stranger.

Id: [0x002DCD50]
It'll need a washing, but my niece will be so grateful! Many thanks, stranger.

Id: [0x002DCD51]
Thanks, stranger!

Id: [0x002DCD52]
O. It's no pleasure being defeated. The hill is yours. You're the true champion.

Id: [0x002DCD53]
Come on, all of you! Kill the traitor!

Id: [0x002DCD54]
Get him, men!

Id: [0x002DCD55]
Welcome to the Tiny Black Market, traveler!

Id: [0x002DCD56]
This kind stranger got you some honey. What do we say? Thank you?

Id: [0x002DCD57]
Betrayal burns your blood, Raven-Feeder. Brother against brother, till wolves devour the sky.

Id: [0x002DCD58]
Trapped in the wyrd, bound for glory. What will you give for its tarnished hue? Who will die?

Id: [0x002DCD59]
Ha! They have bewitched you too. Twirl and spin, dance and grin. Pyewacket comes to bite your shin.

Id: [0x002DCD5A]
Halt, stranger! Show me those arrows.

Id: [0x002DCD5B]
Welcome to St. Martin's Land, weary traveler.

Id: [0x002DCD5C]
I thought we got away, Sis!

Id: [0x002DCD5D]
We will give you what we took, traveler, but first … you must listen to our story!

Id: [0x002DCD5E]
Sorry, large walker.

Id: [0x002DCD5F]
You're wise, large walker.

Id: [0x002DCD60]
Here, large walker!

Id: [0x002DCD61]
Yes, it's a St. Martin's seal! You're welcome here anytime, large walker. You're one of us now. Visit us, okay?

Id: [0x002DCD62]
You're back, large walker!

Id: [0x002DCD63]
Thanks for playing with us, large walker!

Id: [0x002DCD64]
Welcome back, large walker!

Id: [0x002DCD65]
Hey! Where are you going? That's my horse! Stop, you thief! You dirty horse thief!

Id: [0x002DCD66]
Look at that! It's a giant!

Id: [0x002DCD67]
Play hide and seek with us, giant! I bet you hide real good!

Id: [0x002DCD68]
You're not hiding, giant! Play it right!

Id: [0x002DCD69]
I found you, giant.

Id: [0x002DCD6A]
Come out, giant! You won the game!

Id: [0x002DCD6B]
I lie not! You won! I surrender, giant!

Id: [0x002DCD6C]
The giant is the champion!

Id: [0x002DCD6D]
The Hider in Shadows, the one who lurks unseen!

Id: [0x002DCD6E]
This is not your place, heathen. Leave, before you draw the wrath of our Father.

Id: [0x002DCD6F]
Ah, a visitor for Chad the Bewilderer, the most radiant and rakish Riddler. Do you have the wits to best me? There is cake in it if you do.

Id: [0x002DCD70]
They may choose not to walk, but walk they can. Wrong, my friend. Let us try one more.

Id: [0x002DCD71]
You are brighter than the sky-lantern!

Id: [0x002DCD72]
A worthy effort, friend. But some meanings did not find you.

Id: [0x002DCD73]
Wait, may I enquire? The dulcet timbre of your voice. The godlike strength of your gait. You are a warrior, yes?

Id: [0x002DCD74]
Fare thee well, brave hero! Perhaps we will meet again.

Id: [0x002DCD75]
Eivor, like a golden eel, breaks the river's watery seal.

Id: [0x002DCD76]
Brave, good Eivor swims and swims. Swims and swims and swims with vim.

Id: [0x002DCD77]
Our hero stops for a wee forage.

Id: [0x002DCD78]
Our hero's tummy now is full.

Id: [0x002DCD79]
Eivor's face now obscure, I've never seen one so demure.

Id: [0x002DCD7A]
Pig? You ignoramus. Lady Trotters is a hog. And the most unique and singular beauty.

Id: [0x002DCD7B]
Do not worry, Runa. The warrior will find father.

Id: [0x002DCD7D]
Thank you, brave traveler. We knew you would find it.

Id: [0x002DCD7F]
His mother's ring! That fool, that damned, soft, loving fool. [beat]Thank you, stranger. At least I have this.

Id: [0x002DCD80]
Is this the champion you've conjured for the holmgang, Loki Rabbit? Looks like a fine fighter to me.

Id: [0x002DCD81]
Your champion comes crawling back, Loki Rabbit! Good! I am ready.

Id: [0x002DCD82]
Aye! And what did Loki Rabbit promise you, champion? Wealth? Fame? Honor?

Id: [0x002DCD83]
The champion returns! I have no fight left in me, friend. But where is Loki Rabbit?

Id: [0x002DCD84]
Hey! You! My eyes and soul do not deceive me! You are the Wolf-Kissed, are you not? Come, come!

Id: [0x002DCD85]
Ah, Eivor of the Ravens! Have you changed your mind about living forever in song? Bit of coin for a soulful tune?

Id: [0x002DCD86]
How about it, Eivor the Wanderer? Part with a queen's ransom and live on in immortal song?

Id: [0x002DCD87]
Both wise and generous! Truly, you are history's mightiest champion. Now, hold tight while my muse inspires me.

Id: [0x002DCD88]
Frugal and rude? You're even less fun than you look.

Id: [0x002DCD89]
From beyond the whale-roads, from history unknown, did the Norse take a stand, and now all must atone.

Id: [0x002DCD8A]
Now comes Eivor of the Ravens, with the sun for eyes, trailing a river of blood, enough to paint the skies!

Id: [0x002DCD8B]
For the one blessing, and the one curse, is to meet the Wolf-Kissed![ending]

Id: [0x002DCD8C]
There was a cheap little Norse, stinking of ale, with a face like a horse, and a pony for a tail.

Id: [0x002DCD8D]
Always second, never the first. Made to do a master's bidding, a servant cursed!

Id: [0x002DCD8E]
'Tis the fate of a bard such as I! We give and give and get nothing back. [singsong]So it goes.  Farewell, generous champion!

Id: [0x002DCD8F]
Yes, I will. Now, please leave, stranger, before you, too, fall foul of The Withering.

Id: [0x002DCD90]
It is you, Dane! The one from the village. Aye, God saw it fit to spare me their fate. I repay his glory now, healing those here.

Id: [0x002DCD91]
I wish to repay you, beautiful stranger … let's warm up at my hearth. Or better yet, let's do more than that.

Id: [0x002DCD92]
Thank you, friend. Take these trinkets I crafted for Aldwyn! Seems I don't need them anymore.

Id: [0x002DCD93]
Here, stranger. Good art should not be without reward. Take this silver as my patronage for your craft.

Id: [0x002DCD94]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed, is that you?

Id: [0x002DCD95]
There is no comparing. You are building some reputation, Eivor. They talk about you up and down the coast.

Id: [0x002DCD96]
Rolf! Who is your friend?

Id: [0x002DCD97]
Listen up, you sea slugs. This is Eivor Wolf-Kissed, who has killed more men than you will ever meet.

Id: [0x002DCD98]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed! I have heard of you! This will be great!

Id: [0x002DCD99]
Welcome, warrior. Sulke Silvertongue offers wonders from across the Nine Worlds! Rare objects! Priceless artifacts!

Id: [0x002DCD9A]
Everything has value, wise one, and I ask only a fraction of its worth.

Id: [0x002DCD9B]
You arrived without a sound!

Id: [0x002DCD9C]
It suits me! You know, now that I think about it, I think my story should be told in verse. Farewell, Beast-Baiter!

Id: [0x002DCD9D]
Welcome, traveler, to our lush and fertile shores!

Id: [0x002DCD9E]
Hm … what about the Tall One? Can we ask her to help break this tie!

Id: [0x002DCD9F]
Good idea, Frode! Tall One, sit by the hay-side if you vote for the woods! For the river … the side with the sacks of beans!

Id: [0x002DCDA0]
Come on, Tall One!

Id: [0x002DCDA1]
Tall One, you too! Just in case we end up in a tie again!

Id: [0x002DCDA2]
Come on, Tall One!

Id: [0x002DCDA3]
Tall One, we need your help once more!

Id: [0x002DCDA4]
Hurry, Tall One! We don't have much time left to play!

Id: [0x002DCDA5]
The seats have spoken! We shall show no mercy! The Badge of Courage will be given to those who voted as such! You too, Tall One!

Id: [0x002DCDA6]
Frode! Write that down! The Tall One's words will be remembered!

Id: [0x002DCDA7]
The Badge of Wisdom shall be awarded to those who voted for this! You too, Tall One!

Id: [0x002DCDA8]
The Tall One does not want to play, because the Tall One is a big baby.

Id: [0x002DCDA9]
Thanks for the help, Tall One.

Id: [0x002DCDAA]
Your life's purpose was to die for me.

Id: [0x002DCDAB]
Y-you killed the legendary warrior? Th-that is madness! Y-you're crazy!

Id: [0x002DCDAC]
Another Dane with blood on their hands. God will punish you, heathen.

Id: [0x002DCDAD]
I see your stained soul, murderer. You cannot hide from His eyes.

Id: [0x002DCDAE]
Ostara shall grant your wish, through the power of a sacred ritual. Do you both seek the goddess's … succor?

Id: [0x002DCDAF]
Still, you did me a good turn, stranger. Take some meat for your help. The ealdorman won't miss it.

Id: [0x002DCDB0]
You, stranger. Help me talk some sense into him, will you?

Id: [0x002DCDB1]
Thank you stranger. Leave, Father, leave my home and my life. [beat]Your actions have made me an orphan.

Id: [0x002DCDB2]
You can take your manners and shove 'em where Odin can't see. Let's do this, you filthy Dane!

Id: [0x002DCDB3]
Thank you, stranger. You are kind indeed.

Id: [0x002DCDB4]
You are wise, stranger. It is hard to give it up, but … it belongs to her more rightfully than I. Take it to her, please.

Id: [0x002DCDB5]
I saw you talking to my stepmother down there! Did she try to take it off you? What a warty old dragon!

Id: [0x002DCDB6]
What a terrible show, boo, boo…!

Id: [0x002DCDB7]
That stranger got it for him. Oi, that's cheating!

Id: [0x002DCDB8]
Get going, gormless!

Id: [0x002DCDB9]
You're slower than a lumpfish.

Id: [0x002DCDBA]
You pissing-poodle! This is all your fault. Now your thug is smashing up my livelihood.

Id: [0x002DCDBB]
And you're going to just keep it, aren't you?

Id: [0x002DCDBC]
And I have to tell the king I let a Dane steal his gift to his wife?

Id: [0x002DCDBD]
Who are you? An admirer? Can it be true, that so soon upon my path, God has sent me adulation?

Id: [0x002DD098]
Thank you for heeding me, Eivor. I know the worth of such a gesture.

Id: [0x002DD099]
Go, Eivor. Enjoy the fight. You have earned your place here.

Id: [0x002DD09A]
For too long, I stared at the sun! It blinded me to the truth. That it was you. It was you I wanted all along.

Id: [0x002DD09B]
And yet, you insist on doing so… [he looks up from prayer at Eivor's silence]What is it you are looking at? A hare?

Id: [0x002DD09C]
Yes, yes, your word. And when I see him, I will say you protected me from being skewered upon those devils' tusks.

Id: [0x002DD09D]
Eivor! Thank you … for saving my life.

Id: [0x002DD09E]
Ready for that drink, Eivor? But fair warning, my reputation will not suffer another blow.

Id: [0x002DD09F]
And you've told them as much? Cynon is a reasonable man, he'd listen.

Id: [0x002DD0A0]
Oh-oh! Did you stab him? Mother, can I see?

Id: [0x002DD0A1]
And we thought that … if we kept the lad alive we could squeeze Cynon for more coin. To keep his secret.

Id: [0x002DD0A2]
(unintelligible)[Eivor, finally you have returned.]

Id: [0x002DD0A3]
(unintelligible)[Eivor! What has become of Tewdwr? Did you find his body?]

Id: [0x002DD0A4]
You're no friendly spirit at all!

Id: [0x002DD0A5]
[laughs]The Mari Lwyd! O goodness, you are so frightening. What are you doing after the festival?

Id: [0x002DD0A6]
Tewdwr? The boy has the head of a mule. You taught him reason?

Id: [0x002DD0A7]
So go on. Try it yourself.

Id: [0x002DD0A8]
Look. I made this myself, my tallest cairn yet.

Id: [0x002DD0A9]
Eivor, did you hear? The king will visit tomorrow. Sigurd will be with him.

Id: [0x002DD0AA]
Eivor … I hoped I would find you here. You seem well. Your wounds have healed quickly.

Id: [0x002DD0AB]
I hope that pleases you. It pleases me.

Id: [0x002DD0AC]
And the mud smells of lavender. I heard that once.

Id: [0x002DD0AD]
Really. Poor as well, then?

Id: [0x002DD0AE]
This one is no match for you, Jungulf!

Id: [0x002DD0AF]
We all remember when Eivor gave orders to attack Kjotve's clan in Avaldsnes. I knew even then, our chance at victory was slim.

Id: [0x002DD0B0]
It was a fool's errand. But Eivor demanded we strike, and I am not one to disobey my superior. Such is the mark of an honorable man.

Id: [0x002DD0B1]
I could have slain him! A fast stroke of my axe, ending our troubles. But I held back! Why? Because I remembered my oath to Eivor!

Id: [0x002DD0B2]
Though I hope you have bathed recently.

Id: [0x002DD0B3]
You have returned. Would you care to fight?

Id: [0x002DD0B4]
You have returned. To feed me to the plentiful waters, I hope.

Id: [0x002DD0B5]
You are back! Good! The boy must see my end! Return and fight!

Id: [0x002DD0B6]
You have returned. To rid me of my ills, I hope.

Id: [0x002DD0B7]
You have lanced me, Nokkfylla, the fetid boil. Let this death be the only good I have done since my master's death.

Id: [0x002DD0B8]
I … I have been breached. Victory is yours. Victory is mine…

Id: [0x002DD0B9]
My only regret is losing to whatever you are. You reek of fading glory.

Id: [0x002DD0BA]
Praise Odin that you found me! But be still, we are in the lands of the ferocious tree shakers…

Id: [0x002DD0BB]
Thank you, thank you, kinsman. I was so helpless against them. I even tried to use a key I found as a weapon.

Id: [0x002DD0BC]
No! I don't care about your stories! Thank you for bringing my brother back, but please, go away!

Id: [0x002DD0BD]
Th-thank you, for bringing him back. Thank you.

Id: [0x002DD0BE]
We are just about to set off on our grand hunt for the fearsome beast. If the thirst of the hunt itches your throat, will you join us?

Id: [0x002DD0BF]
Safe travels, and watch the woods.

Id: [0x002DD0C0]
So, what brings you here, kinsman? Was it the pull of the wilderness, the thrill of the hunt?

Id: [0x002DD0C1]
If it were your love, you would move the Nine Realms to reunite with her. You care not for us warriors!

Id: [0x002DD0C2]
Thank you. You have earned your title as wise. I will fight in your honor, and keep your name clean in my mouth.

Id: [0x002DD0C3]
Not a brawler remains who dares suffer these pains. You are the winner, the victor, you see, champion of the BBB[bee bee bee].

Id: [0x002DD0C4]
O, God, no! It was only a game. A romp! My dear Tarquin, how could you!

Id: [0x002DD0C5]
All a part of the seduction! O, God! You really thought my life was in danger?

Id: [0x002DD0C6]
Ah, yes, thank you for telling me. And your keen eye on discerning a fellow great warrior.

Id: [0x002DD0C7]
Thank you for getting that man into the water. We had been waiting for too long!

Id: [0x002DD0C8]
An intruder! Die, Aesir!

Id: [0x002DD0C9]
That villain? He's lucky I only caged him. How would you react if you found another man porking your wife?

Id: [0x002DD0CA]
O, stone and soil! Now he will hunt us wherever we go! You have saved us and doomed us all at once!

Id: [0x002DD0CB]
You backed the wrong horse. Dugr the Loud of Mouth took a loan from me to bet on himself. Hoped to win big. Didn't.

Id: [0x002DD0CC]
Crawling back for the legionnaire, I see.

Id: [0x002DD0CD]
I don't make promises I can't keep. But, you paid me in full, so I won't break your knees.

Id: [0x002DD0CE]
Olaf, one of the men you killed, said we had to fight for our land. But he only wanted to kill for silver.

Id: [0x002DD0CF]
The others, they are like clubs. Blunt and ungainly, you are nimble, like a knife.

Id: [0x002DD0D0]
Full of lust for blood and battle, the Big Wolf smashes pots and bodies alike.

Id: [0x002DD0D1]
Loot! Beauteous loot! Hacksilver is stuffed into the Big Wolf's purse.

Id: [0x002DD0D2]
Yes! With your help, we slaughtered the Raven Clan for good!

Id: [0x002DD0D3]
The name's Ryce, Ryce Sherwin. You know, we could use someone like you in our band of merry rogues and knaves.

Id: [0x002DD0D4]
And thank you for showing these turnips some skilled marksmanship. Visit us again. As for the rest of you, keep practicing!

Id: [0x002DD0D5]
O, wow! Thank you for showing me how.

Id: [0x002DD0D6]
We'll see about that. Faith! Cleanse this pagan scum!

Id: [0x002DD0D7]
Faith! Faith…! You monster, how could you? She was so sweet, gentle, and delicate!

Id: [0x002DD0D8]
Flee, heathen coward! Embrace your damnation!

Id: [0x002DD0D9]
I can't eat him! You monster!

Id: [0x002DD0DA]
Murderer! Reaver! Death to all Danes!

Id: [0x002DD0DB]
You are a firestarter!

Id: [0x002DD0DC]
Have you given my letter to my beekeeping love? The hive is not far!

Id: [0x002DD0DD]
You've returned. Did you forget something?

Id: [0x002DD0DE]
Very well. There are two crucial ingredients you must bring me. Bear testicles and fresh lichen.

Id: [0x002DD0DF]
You're back. Have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x002DD0E0]
I was worried, but I'm glad to see you are all right. Your wealth has swelled, has it not?

Id: [0x002DD0E1]
My beloved cat, Sphinxy. And please, do not be so crass. Sphinxy has simply … passed on. She is in God's hands.

Id: [0x002DD0E2]
Have you seen the skald? He may still be under the effects of some mushrooms he ate.

Id: [0x002DD0E3]
You heard me! I need eggs. Viper eggs. Crusty little shits won't go away.

Id: [0x002DD0E4]
Hah! You are very quick. And sturdy by the looks of you.

Id: [0x002DD0E5]
You are far too young to speak so wise. There is a bright future for you and your clan. I would like to add to it.

Id: [0x002DD0E6]
We know. Such is the case in all of Lincolnscire. But you have given us a small victory to celebrate.

Id: [0x002DD0E7]
Just a little longer. Have you changed your mind? Will you take Stikla and send those bandits to Hel?

Id: [0x002DD0E8]
They said a Dane would likely follow close by, and lo and behold.

Id: [0x002DD0E9]
My poor Bjarte. I am so glad he's all right. You saved his life.

Id: [0x002DD0EA]
You are right. I will wait until he wakes, and when he does, I will belt him.

Id: [0x002DD0EB]
O yes, mighty, that is what they are. And me, their goddess. Hm. If you want, use this key and see for yourself! Ooh… My pretty babies…

Id: [0x002DD0EC]
O yes, you. My cats? You're the one who talked about that strange Freyja?

Id: [0x002DD0ED]
You have broken a sacred alliance with the greatest of kingdoms!

Id: [0x002DD0EE]
I want you to know that you can be like me, no longer dumb and angry like heathens.

Id: [0x002DD0EF]
Have you recently tested your faith? Considered the holy path? It is a better way, I swear to you.

Id: [0x002DD0F0]
You see? I am not angry. Make yourself at home, it does not bother me. You will soon change from your pagan ways.

Id: [0x002DD0F1]
O, thank the gods, you've unblocked me.

Id: [0x002DD0F2]
You must have the grace of a cat! Not a drop spilled, thank the gods. I owe you my freedom.

Id: [0x002DD0F3]
Open your eyes! How can you miss it?

Id: [0x002DD0F4]
Do you know nothing? [sigh]The enchanted waters heal people! You just have to show up. But I'll never make it.

Id: [0x002DD0F5]
O, thank you so much for pissing on my dreams. Do me a kindness, would you? Shove something in your gruel hole.

Id: [0x002DD0F6]
I fervently hope I'm not too heavy. Huh… You seem to be of sturdy build. On to Clee Hill and Saint Milburga's miraculous spring!

Id: [0x002DD0F7]
Huh! A lot of good bringing us here did!

Id: [0x002DD0F8]
What? You expect gratitude? I have stumbled after you over rocks and troughs. Did you slow down? No.

Id: [0x002DD0F9]
Did you have to kill Dewdrop? She had such soulful brown eyes.

Id: [0x002DD0FA]
Stop! Have you lost your mind?

Id: [0x002DD0FB]
Just place it next to your ear and you'll hear for yourself!

Id: [0x002DD0FC]
No! You killed my friend!

Id: [0x002DD0FD]
You got the honey? O, thank you!

Id: [0x002DD0FE]
But since you plucked them anyway, would you sell them to me?

Id: [0x002DD0FF]
Would be nice to have some cake, Sister.

Id: [0x002DD100]
I warned you to leave! Now God guides my hand!

Id: [0x002DD101]
You've done enough, and for that, I thank you. But return in a few days and see the ripening fields.

Id: [0x002DD102]
May the gods watch over you, kind one. Farewell.

Id: [0x002DD103]
Wonderful, your wit sparkles! But still … another one.

Id: [0x002DD104]
Your wit outshone my words. And such a feat deserves three cakes! But unfortunately, I do not have any.

Id: [0x002DD105]
No, no! What have you done? Her sobs, her screams. I can no longer hear her call to me!

Id: [0x002DD106]
You! You blew upon the threads and they severed. She is gone, dust and bones, dust and bones.

Id: [0x002DD107]
The stars prophesied our meeting! I am the gleewoman Aswig the Mellifluous. You have heard of me? No matter.

Id: [0x002DD108]
Eivor is walking like a duck! It's like she doesn't give a … fa-la-la-la and nonny nonny noo.

Id: [0x002DD109]
Eivor like a mountain goat! Toss your hero half a groat.

Id: [0x002DD10A]
Eivor, skulking in the shadow, meek and quiet as a sparrow.

Id: [0x002DD10B]
What a fearsome bird our Eivor has!

Id: [0x002DD10C]
Eivor, forgetting how to dance, takes an arrow in the arse.

Id: [0x002DD10D]
Just a tiny scratch is all. Eivor will but walk it off!

Id: [0x002DD10E]
Eivor running from the past, with mighty speed to flabbergast.

Id: [0x002DD10F]
Eivor ran into the fray. None of you will survive the day.

Id: [0x002DD110]
Eivor ran away, away. Bravely ran away, away.

Id: [0x002DD111]
Eivor the fleet of foot, the sharp of blade. You have returned. Let us again make lasting memories!

Id: [0x002DD112]
Yes, flee, you coward! Just like Loki Rabbit-Heart!

Id: [0x002DD113]
That face, that scowl… yes indeed, you must be the Wolf-Kissed! Your fame and generosity are well-known to me!

Id: [0x002DD114]
Succumb to your fate with a kiss, a blade to your throat, the wolf's fangs to your shins.

Id: [0x002DD115]
Alas ends the tale of Eivor the Boar, the Cheap, the Second! Ei-ei-ei-vor! Oink!

Id: [0x002DD116]
Here, a key if you want to check on the sick, yourself. If I'm to leave, I can't face them again.

Id: [0x002DD117]
Listen to you! If you are such a poet, help me open the door to his heart.

Id: [0x002DD118]
By Thor's hammer! It is Eivor! The Dragon of the Northern Waters!

Id: [0x002DD119]
Make way for Eivor, the Terror of the Western Shores!

Id: [0x002DD11A]
I did not mean you, but I could use your help choosing a leader. I have picked out a few to be tested.

Id: [0x002DD11F]
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?

Id: [0x002DD122]
No! Come back! I can pay, I can pay a lot.

Id: [0x002DD188]
That groveling worm in a cage? You must be blind to stand with such a man.

Id: [0x002DD189]
Tewdwr! This is Eivor, my chieftain.

Id: [0x002DD18A]
But, at the end of all things, you will find yourself with nothing but your regrets.

Id: [0x002DD18B]
I heard my father talking to the others. He said you were his child now, so … so that makes me your brother.

Id: [0x002DD18C]
I see no way in which this can occur. Unless, you prove me wrong, fair challenger.

Id: [0x002DD18D]
Akwáhs nihseweién:te’ ne kí:ken.
[Yo<LF> are quite good at this.]

Id: [0x002DD18E]
We are done here. If we ever meet again back on familiar ground, you are welcome to join us.

Id: [0x002DD18F]
Ha! If my eyes don't deceive. The BBB misses you dearly, brawler! Keep our spirit alive!

Id: [0x002DD190]
A challenger approaches!

Id: [0x002DD191]
Help me, O Savior! Rescue me from this dastardly man!

Id: [0x002DD192]
Yes! You've done it again! I think we are destined to do this forever.

Id: [0x002DD193]
A curse on that woman. Sending an Aesir to do her dirty work!

Id: [0x002DD194]
Wonderful stranger! My everlasting thanks for saving me… [catching herself]saving us.

Id: [0x002DD195]
Come drink with us, stranger!

Id: [0x002DD196]
Come and kneel before your raid leader, Big Wolf!

Id: [0x002DD197]
The only good heretic is a very dead heretic!

Id: [0x002DD198]
You look like the sort who laps at their brew like a kitten.

Id: [0x002DD199]
Come here, raider. Have a sit with me.

Id: [0x002DD19A]
Thank you, stranger. For bringing this waste of breath back to me.

Id: [0x002DD19B]
Destiny has made you my muse! I shall follow you, record your great deeds with poetry.

Id: [0x002DD19C]
My muse returns!

Id: [0x002DD19D]
I shall try it your way, wordsmith.

Id: [0x002DD19F]
Confident are you? Let us see how you fare against the Ale Beast of East Anglia.

Id: [0x002DD1A0]
Persistent bastard!

Id: [0x002DD1A1]
Eivor. Tyr said you would come. Welcome.

Id: [0x002DD1A2]
Now, what did I just tell you, you…

Id: [0x002DD1A3]
Cynon! I do not need a heathen escort!

Id: [0x002DD1A4]
Be welcome, Aesir. Our father's hall is a haven to all.

Id: [0x002DD1A5]
Take all plunder you want, vikingr! Take us also, and let the love-hunger consume you!

Id: [0x002DD1A6]
On the mark! Well, friend, you can count on us to lend a hand against King Constantin and his well paid Picts.

Id: [0x002DD1A7]
Don't be shy! You'll feel better after you repent!

Id: [0x002DD1A8]
By God, you're as vile as she is!

Id: [0x002DD1A9]
You're the same as all the others! Get 'im, Eawynn!

Id: [0x002DD1AA]
Come here, Sprout!

Id: [0x002DD1AB]
O, Brother Holthwulf, and you've made a friend as well. Good to have you back!

Id: [0x002DD1AC]
Do you not see them? Stout fellows all. And you! Make yourself useful and help prepare the ship, friend.

Id: [0x002DD1AD]
You naughty boy! Just look at this mess. The house has been upended! Who is this?

Id: [0x002DD1AE]
O I give up. I give up! [cough]You are the better fighter.[exert]

Id: [0x002DD1B0]
You have my thanks, kind one.

Id: [0x002DD1B1]
You are both welcome to any good crops my farm will produce. Look for me at my farm in a few days!

Id: [0x002DD1B2]
Parting is a sorrow that fills my cup to overflowing.

Id: [0x002DD1B3]
That was not a mistake. You looked like a good fighter. I was hoping you would kill or weaken Olaf so I could escape.

Id: [0x002DD1B4]
Your chance is over! You're not as swift as Otta! Legends are not talked into sagas!

Id: [0x002DD1B5]
You have me there, friend. I cannot be certain. It's a very old Dane horn. Help me into my house. You can judge for yourself.

Id: [0x002DD1B6]
A terrible display, friend. And now the sweet treats will go uneaten.

Id: [0x002DD1B7]
When danger rears its ugly head, Eivor balks and just stops dead.

Id: [0x002DD1B8]
Eivor gives the Saxons grief. Hack and slash them, break their teeth!

Id: [0x002DD1B9]
Hm. Tragic that is. I think the lad can still be molded, Eivor. You might be just the one to do that.

Id: [0x002DD1BA]
My wounds hurt deep. If you could carry me to safety, kinsman, I would be indebted!

Id: [0x002DD1BB]
Into the unknown we go! Join us, kinsman!

Id: [0x002DD1BC]
But there is one who has not been laid low. Let me see to that.

Id: [0x002DD1BD]
I have unlocked the door, kind stranger. You are welcome to come in.

Id: [0x002DD1BE]
Ah! A brave steed has swept me up!

Id: [0x002DD1BF]
Eivor does not share her snacks.

Id: [0x002DD1C0]
Eivor charges up her bow! Watch that arrow go and go!

Id: [0x002DD1C1]
Did you see that! He flew!

Id: [0x002DD1C2]
Eivor! You came. Dinner will still be served, but I am afraid you are too early. My intended and her family are not ready.

Id: [0x002DD1C3]
Her name is Valdis. And people don't marry for love these days, Eivor. This is an arrangement for East Anglia's benefit.

Id: [0x002DD1C4]
Eivor, good to see you.

Id: [0x002DD1C5]
I hope your faith in pig farmers is not misplaced, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1C6]
Another king lost, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1C7]
I will take this news to our forward camp, Eivor. Follow when you can.

Id: [0x002DD1C8]
King's Bury's church has a great horn atop its steeple. If you manage the task, blow it and I'll know you kept your word.

Id: [0x002DD1C9]
They need your words, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1CB]
Eivor! Is that you?

Id: [0x002DD1CC]
Eivor…

Id: [0x002DD1CD]
Well fought, well fought! The both of you!

Id: [0x002DD1CE]
Eivor! The festivities have only just begun. Enjoy yourself.

Id: [0x002DD1CF]
Eivor! Drink, come, [hic]drink!

Id: [0x002DD1D0]
Aye, stronger than me. You drink as well as Valdis. Now that I would pay to see![laugh]

Id: [0x002DD1D1]
Now, you owe me some silver.

Id: [0x002DD1D2]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DD1D3]
He is. If not for you, I would have lost him. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1D4]
Ah, greetings, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1D5]
Eivor. You will be missed.

Id: [0x002DD1D6]
Aye, Eivor. Without a moment's hesitation. Travel safe.

Id: [0x002DD1D7]
Will you not stay a moment longer, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DD1D8]
I did, didn't I? Take care, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1DA]
Thank you, Eivor, for making today a reality.

Id: [0x002DD1DB]
Eivor. The plan worked. One of Wigmund's captains. Caught him sniffing around Duroliponte.

Id: [0x002DD1DC]
Mount up, Eivor. It's a long ride to Tamworth.

Id: [0x002DD1DD]
What happened to the silver you took from Audun? You could hire a band of sellswords with that much.

Id: [0x002DD1DF]
Odin be with you, Eivor. I'll make the necessary preparations.

Id: [0x002DD1E1]
Pull up your hood, we may not be safe just yet.

Id: [0x002DD1E2]
Raise your horn, Eivor. What stops you?

Id: [0x002DD1E3]
Do not despair, Eivor. Look. Your friends are here. Everyone you could ever want is here beside you.

Id: [0x002DD1E4]
This place can be whatever you wish it to be, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1E5]
You would resign yourself to an empty death?

Id: [0x002DD1E6]
Up, Eivor! Up!

Id: [0x002DD1E7]
Rise, drengr. This is not your end.

Id: [0x002DD1E8]
Come closer, Eivor. Let me get a better look at you!

Id: [0x002DD1E9]
He's mad, Eivor! Silence him.

Id: [0x002DD1EA]
Come, Eivor! Come save your crippled prince of dead ravens!

Id: [0x002DD1EB]
Yes, good. Come, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1EC]
But I know you would defy me to the death, fighting for a glorious end. That I will not allow.

Id: [0x002DD1ED]
Eivor, you came!

Id: [0x002DD1EE]
O, you do revel in rendering me a foolish mess. I thought you might be cross with me, with how your last visit ended.

Id: [0x002DD1EF]
Eivor, may I ask? What is it that you seek forgiveness for?

Id: [0x002DD1F0]
I was raised to be a priest, Eivor. So I know what a troubled face looks like.

Id: [0x002DD1F1]
Well, if you ever need someone to talk to, let me shoulder some of that burden. If you have a need.

Id: [0x002DD1F2]
Eivor, over here!

Id: [0x002DD1F3]
Eivor! Thought I smelt you on the wind!

Id: [0x002DD1F4]
I have. This Valkyrie right here. Brigid, my own heart's root, meet Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD1F5]
No, no, no, we're here for the festival and blessings. Brigid's hand must be given. You know me, Eivor, I'm forged in honor.

Id: [0x002DD1F6]
Apples! Eivor, wait until you try the cider. You like cider, eh, Tewdwr? Cider?

Id: [0x002DD1F7]
My ladylove calls, Eivor. O, if you'd like to join us later, we're going hoodening this eve.

Id: [0x002DD1F8]
Low in a mead of kine under a thorn, lieth poor Kenhelm king-born. Is this land not beautiful, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DD1F9]
Look, the path is untouched by danger.[Dismissing Eivor] So, your company is not needed.

Id: [0x002DD1FA]
Please Eivor, I must pray.

Id: [0x002DD1FB]
Give me my moment's prayer, Eivor. I ask only this.

Id: [0x002DD1FC]
And Eivor? I owe you a drink at least, later, if you'd have one. Find me at the festivities.

Id: [0x002DD1FD]
Eivor! There you are.

Id: [0x002DD1FE]
But you saved his hide? [Loaded beat]I bet it was quite the sight, two of you as a pair.

Id: [0x002DD1FF]
Restraint, Eivor? I was half-expecting you to wallop the lad round the head and arse.

Id: [0x002DD200]
[quietly knocking his cup against Eivor's]Skal.

Id: [0x002DD201]
Glowecestre gives their glut to otherworldly visitors. And, if you dress as one, you'll get that bounty yourself.

Id: [0x002DD202]
Eivor, Eivor, put the hood on!

Id: [0x002DD203]
I'm glad you're all finding my mortal injury so funny. Go, Eivor, make merry and try to loosen Tewdwr's shoulders.

Id: [0x002DD204]
Ha! Ale is known to blunt even the sharpest of blades, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD205]
Eivor! There you are.

Id: [0x002DD206]
[Ono: nervous laughter]And how nice is that?

Id: [0x002DD207]
Eivor! I heard alarms sounded. What in Hel's hall is going on?

Id: [0x002DD208]
Eivor! What's going on?

Id: [0x002DD209]
A sorry tale. Did you learn anything from Halewyn?

Id: [0x002DD20A]
I am a very good healer, but if the gods want him to join them, I cannot stop their will. [pause]Eivor, what will you do with Cynon?

Id: [0x002DD20B]
Eivor! Have you … have you been enjoying the festivities?

Id: [0x002DD20C]
Ha! We've turned you in circles like a dog, haven't we? Modron was the architect of Tewdwr's murder, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD20D]
Thank you, Eivor. Your mercy will be rewarded, I'm sure.

Id: [0x002DD20E]
For you, love, I could be.

Id: [0x002DD20F]
Worry not, Eivor. You and I have many tales to tell yet. And our names ring out clear and with honor.

Id: [0x002DD210]
Eivor, the honor is yours.

Id: [0x002DD211]
Eivor! I'm bored to death here.

Id: [0x002DD212]
Ow! What did you do that for?

Id: [0x002DD213]
Come on, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD214]
Eivor, you bacraut (asshole). I know you hear me.

Id: [0x002DD215]
Yes, years ago, Eivor had staked a claim on Kjotve's life. So I left the bacraut (asshole) alone. Yes.

Id: [0x002DD216]
It was just before you came, Eivor. Rued's men had made a spectacle of the poor man, a Christian priest.

Id: [0x002DD217]
Even with us cleaving through it. [beat]Hope, Eivor. Hope. I think that is what their God brings them.

Id: [0x002DD218]
You remember my mother, Eivor? Trygve told me a story about her when father was ill. I had never heard him talk about her before.

Id: [0x002DD219]
She even made him live with Trygve for a few moons. No one is safe from their wives, Eivor. Not even jarls and kings!

Id: [0x002DD21A]
Still, I may not have known her in life, Eivor, but I know she lives inside these veins.

Id: [0x002DD21B]
Remember the girl Astrid, Eivor? I asked her to come with me when we left Norway.

Id: [0x002DD21C]
Death to us both!

Id: [0x002DD21D]
I see no way forward. I cannot be defeated. Unless you can prove me wrong, fair challenger.

Id: [0x002DD21E]
Good fighting! What a beast we felled! You showed true grit out there. Thank you for joining our hunt.

Id: [0x002DD21F]
You there! I know you! You're one of us, the BBB! Gave us quite the throttling. Fancy bumpin' into you out here.

Id: [0x002DD220]
Yes … yes, I shall do as you say. My father would want the same. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD221]
You're right. I must carry on, with or without him. Thank you, Eivor. May the Lord be with you.

Id: [0x002DD222]
Crowland is ours, cur!

Id: [0x002DD223]
Ha! Good, destiny is coming to your plate. Grandfather, there's someone looking for a walloping!

Id: [0x002DD224]
Ah, as I suspected. It must be from my most recent battle. You should see the other man. He got the worst of it.

Id: [0x002DD225]
I don't like your tone, Aesir. You think you're better than us, just like she did. Maybe it's time to shut your mouth.

Id: [0x002DD226]
Scum of Asgard! Trying to cut my throat in the night!

Id: [0x002DD227]
Then you shouldn't have let me catch my breath, fool!

Id: [0x002DD228]
A newcomer! Wet your throat with us, and be merry!

Id: [0x002DD229]
Seek a lonely tree on the shore and walk beneath it. You will see. Now let us drink to the fallen.

Id: [0x002DD22A]
Two fight with two, that is the rule. But have no fear! You'll have little to do but watch as Dugr the Bold destroys his foes!

Id: [0x002DD22B]
So you've reconsidered. Ready to join forces with Dugr the Bold?

Id: [0x002DD22C]
Aye. But you're an Aesir. Your kind killed my brothers. So I'll be keeping you both awhile till I decide what to do with you.

Id: [0x002DD22D]
I can't help noticing you haven't released me yet.

Id: [0x002DD22E]
That may be so! But, this scoundrel will play naught but the sweetest music for his freedom. You understand?

Id: [0x002DD22F]
If you pay up front then, deal. But, we need a signal. For if he's coming, and for when you're all clear.

Id: [0x002DD230]
You speak with the wisdom of Odin, Eivor. I will think on these words when I am in bed.

Id: [0x002DD231]
If you are as brave as you appear, you will come.

Id: [0x002DD232]
You could help us pretend we are raiding! That will make my water flow! Come, we must tell my husband.

Id: [0x002DD233]
Hm-hm. Delicate touch, indelicate voice. This was fun, Eivor. Hold onto the comb, as a keepsake.

Id: [0x002DD234]
You did, er, remember the arrow, right?

Id: [0x002DD235]
So would you be if your every crop of turnips was demolished by a horde of mangy horrors!

Id: [0x002DD236]
You got them! Every last one! Exterminated like the hairballs of Satan that they are!

Id: [0x002DD237]
Now we do what we must to keep body and soul together. [realizing]Here, you figured out our trick. Can you help us?

Id: [0x002DD238]
You have done us a great service! I will compose this day into song! Farewell.

Id: [0x002DD239]
You're right, Eivor of Raven Clan! Hey, come on back if you ever want to dance again.

Id: [0x002DD23A]
Have you any idea how important I am? I shall have you both flayed and hung from the city gates.

Id: [0x002DD23B]
Ah! My soon-to-be highly coveted elixir. You see, one gulp puts you to sleep, and when you wake up, you are suddenly richer.

Id: [0x002DD23C]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002DD23D]
Ahh. Here it is. Would you be so kind?

Id: [0x002DD23E]
[sigh]Thank you … for all your help. I don't know many Danes, and don't care to, but you've helped bring closure to this journey.

Id: [0x002DD23F]
It will not be easy. Why not take my wife with you? Stikla would love to raise Hel against these dogs.

Id: [0x002DD240]
You made it look effortless.

Id: [0x002DD241]
Made short work of those bastards.

Id: [0x002DD242]
Sounds like you were fond of him. My sympathies.

Id: [0x002DD243]
Yes! You have carried out my revenge! Wonderful. Now they must revel in their nudeness forever!

Id: [0x002DD244]
Ah, yes. The realm is safe … for now. Hej, drengr.

Id: [0x002DD245]
O, surely. We will share the Lord's work with ye. The iron tinge, you will taste it. We all have earned it after fasting.

Id: [0x002DD246]
I am no mere boy. I am Hurrey, slayer of monsters. You'll have to win it from me in single combat.

Id: [0x002DD247]
I cannot weep! As a raider, I taught myself not to. Could you … could you give me leave to weep?

Id: [0x002DD248]
Huh. It is always good to fight. But friend, it did not take away my grief.

Id: [0x002DD249]
What have you done?

Id: [0x002DD24A]
A horrible old hag who wants to make me into rabbit stew! Thanks for helping me get out of here!

Id: [0x002DD24C]
Back again? They always come back.

Id: [0x002DD24D]
You bought all my treasures! Thank you!

Id: [0x002DD24E]
May you live till the moon falls from the sky!

Id: [0x002DD24F]
Silly! I'm not alone, with the very best of bears by my side. Goodbye, and thank you!

Id: [0x002DD250]
What? When you so carelessly discarded those arrows, you discarded the history of this kingdom!

Id: [0x002DD251]
You're back!

Id: [0x002DD252]
You'll get us both caught! Go away!

Id: [0x002DD253]
My God names you the Crow-Eyed Devil. And He sends out his angels to find you and kill you.

Id: [0x002DD254]
And then they will fling you into the pits of Hell, demon.

Id: [0x002DD255]
Not so, sadly you just do not deserve them.

Id: [0x002DD256]
This will not make great poetry, Eivor. Do something. Anything.

Id: [0x002DD257]
First there was a famine and now, look here, a feast! Fare thee well, Eivor of the Raven Clan. Your exploits will live on in me.

Id: [0x002DD258]
Fleet of foot and long of gait, O Eivor, do I prate your fate.

Id: [0x002DD259]
Did you at least find the treasure?

Id: [0x002DD25A]
And what about Father, did you find him?

Id: [0x002DD25B]
You there! You look like you could handle yourself in a fight.

Id: [0x002DD25C]
This is my raiding crew, Eivor. What they lack in experience, they make up for in … other areas.

Id: [0x002DD25D]
You want to lead my crew, you must fight Eivor. Best fighter wins. No killing, no maiming. Other than that, no rules. Understand?

Id: [0x002DD25E]
Thank you for your help. You did not have to do this.

Id: [0x002DD25F]
The gods have been deaf to my pleas, but you are here.

Id: [0x002DD260]
But maybe you could lead me to a victory?

Id: [0x002DD261]
Thor's balls, you found it! Why did you take it back? You set him off again.

Id: [0x002DD262]
Perhaps that silly bugger was right, the wolves are fearsome. Thank you, you saved my skin.

Id: [0x002DD263]
You've ruined me, and you don't care. No one cares. What a world, what a world!

Id: [0x002DD264]
You would be, too, if you had miracle legs.

Id: [0x002DD265]
Looks can be deceiving. Have you heard of the great Pheidippides? The mighty hero of old?

Id: [0x002DD268]
Jesus wept upon the Holy Cross. Fuck off the both of you. Aelfred will get the jewel when I get what I'm owed.

Id: [0x002DD269]
Quiet now, Chad. [to Eivor]Come, hand him over to me.

Id: [0x002DD493]
Wait, wait! What are you doing? I'm just a pig farmer.

Id: [0x002DD494]
The choice you make will be the right one.

Id: [0x002DD495]
You remember this…?

Id: [0x002DD496]
But, enough of that. You deserve a diverting evening of friendship. Come, I've something to show you.

Id: [0x002DD497]
A union forged in love! Come, we'll go find him. O, and don't blame me if he's heard a tale or two about you. What about it, Brig?

Id: [0x002DD498]
(unintelligible)[No thanks, you two are bags of hot air around each other. Let Eivor get the earful.]

Id: [0x002DD499]
Are you playing the role of trickster spirit?

Id: [0x002DD49A]
O? The gossip mill has not ground its wheat this way yet. What do you need?

Id: [0x002DD49B]
Are you a spirit of darkness? If it be not so, come back and try anew.

Id: [0x002DD49C]
Go with the wind and leaves, good friend of the hills!

Id: [0x002DD49D]
Look, Eivor, we're mates right? Had drinks together? Remember the chickens?

Id: [0x002DD49E]
The man tarnished your name and you would let him live?

Id: [0x002DD49F]
Do it, then. Leave Glowecestrescire in the hands of that Christian, and for what? Your name and some trade routes.

Id: [0x002DD4A0]
Tell me please. What of Modron?

Id: [0x002DD4A1]
[ONO: Pained gasp]I didn't think… I hoped you would spare her at least.

Id: [0x002DD4A2]
Bleed! Like Ceolbert.

Id: [0x002DD4A3]
He was betrayed and murdered. By those who denied his friendship, just as you deny him now!

Id: [0x002DD4A4]
Return, you louse!

Id: [0x002DD4A5]
Are you here for blood? Like all of those wretched others? Speak!

Id: [0x002DD4A6]
Do you remember Ingrid the chicken? The one that the wretched old hermit woman used to keep? I stole her, you know.

Id: [0x002DD4A7]
Join me then, in Drengr-Seidr. Ragnar taught it to me at Upsalla for nine moons and I never stopped.

Id: [0x002DD4A8]
Drink from the brew you see in my pot, and our frenzied battle will begin.

Id: [0x002DD4A9]
My weapons are polished and prepared, if you wish to dance.

Id: [0x002DD4AA]
If you come looking for bears, there are none living here. Not now. But I have a better proposition than a rousing hunt.

Id: [0x002DD4AB]
Please. Indulge me with the honor of my death.

Id: [0x002DD4AC]
My unbreakable shell awaits the impossible. Be on your way.

Id: [0x002DD4AD]
Yes! Break me, drengr!

Id: [0x002DD4AF]
H-hey! Where are you going? You can't leave me here! P-please!

Id: [0x002DD4B0]
Watch out for his … affections. Arne is the fiery sort, loves to give … kisses. Please don't kill him if he pecks you a bit.

Id: [0x002DD4B1]
Try it, they're quite delicious!

Id: [0x002DD4B2]
Moo. (Thank you and good luck, godling.)

Id: [0x002DD4B3]
My home at Noatun will bring me pleasure enough. But what about you, Wily One? What do you love?

Id: [0x002DD4B4]
Then from what I kn-know of the world and all the … realms … you will never go hungry. Good luck to you.

Id: [0x002DD4B5]
Hold right there, you speedy hare. No entry to you past this point without a password to anoint.

Id: [0x002DD4B6]
To compete, a phrase that must be spoken, but it seems you don't yet have this token.

Id: [0x002DD4B7]
Worry not, young pup, and look around, if memory serves, there's a clue to be found.

Id: [0x002DD4B8]
Now ball your fists and step right in, there's fun to be had and bones broken!

Id: [0x002DD4B9]
Splendid! And now, for your opponent…

Id: [0x002DD4BA]
There may be shared blood in your veins against this rapid firing Dane, Bolla of Cent.

Id: [0x002DD4BB]
I think it's time your head get stung, for none remain but the silver tongue. One on one, you'll fight with me, champion of the BBB.

Id: [0x002DD4BC]
Ah! A keen eye and clever nose, you'll need them both to keep on your toes.

Id: [0x002DD4BD]
Enter, enter, take your shot. But, careful! Don't get beat to snot.

Id: [0x002DD4BE]
Go on now, carry our name, with only pride and never shame! Remember how it was you came to be blessed with so much fame!

Id: [0x002DD4BF]
Watching you rub bodies was an absolute treat. You move just like a noodle, my favorite thing to eat.

Id: [0x002DD4C0]
It would please me to no end to watch you fight again. So whenever, now, or then, return promptly to my den.

Id: [0x002DD4C1]
You must fight for me with all your heart, for if you fail, a lifetime of gloom awaits me!

Id: [0x002DD4C2]
Wait. No! Come back! You must fight for me. I am in a perpetual state of danger and must be protected!

Id: [0x002DD4C3]
Stay back. Do not touch this tree!

Id: [0x002DD4C4]
Stop talking like that! He'll come back! He said so! Just … just leave me be.

Id: [0x002DD4C5]
Leave me alone! And never come back! I don't ever want to see you again!

Id: [0x002DD4C6]
How dare you insult the brave and valorous soldiers of--

Id: [0x002DD4C7]
You want some wisdom? Don't become a hero like I have. I'm cursed with this wallop.

Id: [0x002DD4C8]
Don't test my might. Please.

Id: [0x002DD4C9]
I see.[sigh] I suppose you want to see the wallop?

Id: [0x002DD4CA]
Excuse me, I have a slight pain. Do you notice anything on my head? It's an itch or a cut that simply won't go away.

Id: [0x002DD4CB]
Get out of my house!

Id: [0x002DD4CC]
You'll be my newest trophy!

Id: [0x002DD4CD]
Stop! Stop! Take what you want, just spare me!

Id: [0x002DD4CE]
You leave me little choice. Let that faithless wench have her pretty-boy, then. Here's the key.

Id: [0x002DD4CF]
King Snortington demands tribute! Don't make us lock you up like we did your Aesir friend!

Id: [0x002DD4D0]
Follow me to the pit, and we will destroy our opponents together!

Id: [0x002DD4D1]
And you won't regret it! For Dugr the Bold is not only a great warrior but a shapeshifter of peerless skill!

Id: [0x002DD4D2]
Proud fools! They are afraid I will show them up with my fighting prowess. You're not afraid, are you?

Id: [0x002DD4D3]
Actually, I would call them "potential facts." Now release me? Please?

Id: [0x002DD4D4]
How dare you imply that I hide behind my cloth from men who would break my instruments for a mere fifty silver!

Id: [0x002DD4D5]
O? I have never seen such a battle, please enlighten me.

Id: [0x002DD4D6]
What are you doing! Get out of my house!

Id: [0x002DD4D7]
You sound like my father. What do you need? If you try to chop me to bits, I'll scream.

Id: [0x002DD4D8]
Follow me!

Id: [0x002DD4D9]
Fine. Follow me.

Id: [0x002DD4DA]
You will never see me again! I will be a white rabbit in the snow!

Id: [0x002DD4DB]
Have you come to face me finally? Or will you continue to harass me from afar?

Id: [0x002DD4DC]
Then let me.

Id: [0x002DD4DD]
O, you do mean to help me! God bless you!

Id: [0x002DD4DE]
Go on! Nail those bobtailed little shits!

Id: [0x002DD4DF]
That's right! Get in there! Mash their little bunny heads in!

Id: [0x002DD4E0]
Show me how the Raven Clan drink!

Id: [0x002DD4E1]
You will die as my Cearo did!

Id: [0x002DD4E2]
We are the wisps of the swamp. Leave all you have as tribute, or you will never see the sun again!

Id: [0x002DD4E3]
Do you seek your doom? The light on the left!

Id: [0x002DD4E4]
If you dare to face the spirits of the fog, follow the light on the right.

Id: [0x002DD4E5]
Not that way! Go back or be lost forever!

Id: [0x002DD4E6]
Don't chase me! Alden's got the most silver!

Id: [0x002DD4E7]
So you will kidnap him and make it look good! [beat]His house is near here, surrounded by red flowers.

Id: [0x002DD4E8]
You will know my love by his red hair. And try not to kill his father. That will put a damper on our happy day.

Id: [0x002DD4EA]
Yes, this is him. O my sweet pudding![to Eivor] Please, lay him gently down.

Id: [0x002DD4EB]
Hello? O brave protector. Have you come to claim my hand?

Id: [0x002DD4EC]
I … I did not mean to deceive you so … come sit, drink and I will tell you my story.

Id: [0x002DD4ED]
You are right. But now I beg you, leave me to my sorrow.

Id: [0x002DD4EE]
Don't kill 'em. Don't want that. Scare 'em off. It's the animals they fear, remember?

Id: [0x002DD4EF]
Speak!

Id: [0x002DD4F0]
My soul won't rest until you open your purse and put some fucking silver on the ground!

Id: [0x002DD4F1]
That's mine! I swindled hard for that! Give it here.

Id: [0x002DD4F2]
You're leaving? Darn, I was starting to like the twang of your bow. Good twang. Come back anytime.

Id: [0x002DD4F3]
If you would do this kindness for Gill, then you must be a kindred spirit. Do you also enjoy the stamen AND the petal?

Id: [0x002DD4F4]
I had a feeling you would understand! I've painted my love in words in this letter. Let your romantic heart guide you.

Id: [0x002DD4F5]
Ah! Look at that!

Id: [0x002DD4F6]
You have? O, wonderful! Would you bring them to the shrine just over there, beneath that shrub?

Id: [0x002DD4F7]
Smart, you mean. I must have taken mother's axe out of the house knowing this fool would forget it.

Id: [0x002DD4F8]
Hear a story or two.

Id: [0x002DD4F9]
Take this key, and if you find yourself in Repton, seek out my quarters near the docks. There's a large tree out front.

Id: [0x002DD4FA]
Call it a gift, from the old guard to the new. Odin guide your way, young drengr.

Id: [0x002DD4FB]
And maybe not even then! That is twice you have earned my admiration. Please, tell me your name.

Id: [0x002DD4FC]
You honor her. And believe me, I have tried. But she is stubborn. Insists on looking after this old and frail hound.

Id: [0x002DD4FD]
What! No, please. Look at him! He is deadweight.

Id: [0x002DD4FE]
Punch his cock. Yes. That should get the point across. Thank you… Err, you will never see us again.

Id: [0x002DD4FF]
Get me off this thing!

Id: [0x002DD500]
Why don't you let us decide?

Id: [0x002DD501]
Begone! This prisoner comes with me!

Id: [0x002DD502]
He's ruffled some feathers, that much is clear. You know him?

Id: [0x002DD503]
O gods, Bjarte! Bring him inside!

Id: [0x002DD504]
O! That's the crate where we put our clothes. Feel free to store yours in there too.

Id: [0x002DD505]
Just put your … hey! Stop that. Put it down!

Id: [0x002DD506]
You desecrate my integrity by insinuating such… But my faith cannot be desecrated. Praise be to my Lord.

Id: [0x002DD507]
O, no, that's … I mean, that key … do what you like with it. Throw it in the river. My faith will not budge.

Id: [0x002DD508]
Please! Make a path through the jars so I can get out. And-and, don't break any. The smell is awful!

Id: [0x002DD509]
Look around you! There's no end of preparations we must do. Start where you will!

Id: [0x002DD50A]
Arrows! Bring as many as you can. Imagine the terror in our enemies' eyes when a hail of arrows falls from the blue!

Id: [0x002DD50B]
We're ready to launch out on the roiling sea! Summon Skarde, Knut and the rest of the crew! Blow your horn!

Id: [0x002DD50C]
O, by the gods! Will you blow that damn horn?

Id: [0x002DD50D]
Where are you going? I give up.

Id: [0x002DD50E]
You'll frighten the sheep!

Id: [0x002DD50F]
Come sit and wait with me. She'll be here soon.

Id: [0x002DD510]
Please don't hurt my friend! They're all I have!

Id: [0x002DD511]
I, Matilda the Seer, lift the veil. Shall I show you what is to come, Raven?

Id: [0x002DD512]
Who are you? A seeker. A wanderer. A killer. Woman or man, you wear a magician's cloak and speak to ravens.

Id: [0x002DD514]
Eivor picks some poisoned grub. [beat]Ha! I jest of course.

Id: [0x002DD515]
Eivor climbs on top of the world!

Id: [0x002DD516]
Please do, and not for the reasons you are insinuating. You are confusing her delicate nose with your earthy stench.

Id: [0x002DD517]
The world weeps at its loss! [beat]Go forth and plunder, so that all may hear your praises properly sung.

Id: [0x002DD518]
Stop! Not a step closer!

Id: [0x002DD519]
P-please, don't hurt me!

Id: [0x002DD51A]
Lord above! What are you doing! Stop!

Id: [0x002DD51B]
Aren't you a wise devil? Why didn't I think of that!

Id: [0x002DD51C]
Suit yourself. It would have been a good time.

Id: [0x002DD51D]
You wield more than honeyed words, don't you? Take as a gift anything you like from my house, but please, leave my heart.

Id: [0x002DD51E]
I am flattered you remember.

Id: [0x002DD51F]
You want to fight them all at once?

Id: [0x002DD520]
Tougher than you know. Thorgils got back up after you went down. He finished the fight.

Id: [0x002DD521]
Leave me alone!

Id: [0x002DD522]
This world is all I know, and this life all I have left. Would you take that from me?

Id: [0x002DD523]
Take anything you want from my shop. Take everything. Just let me live.

Id: [0x002DD524]
They say they do not want it, but I know they will sell it all once my light burns out. Will you lend me your strength?

Id: [0x002DD525]
Done? That was to announce my arrival. Now, I leave this world. Enjoy your life.

Id: [0x002DD526]
Make sure to bring me a beast!

Id: [0x002DD527]
Of course, of course, a tour. Follow me.

Id: [0x002DD528]
What are you saying?

Id: [0x002DD529]
You're making it sound stupid when you say it like that.

Id: [0x002DD52A]
Look, there he is! He breaches the water, do you not see his demonic flippers?

Id: [0x002DD52B]
Hello? I can hear you out there! Aren't you going to save me?

Id: [0x002DD52C]
Huh… There's a bear in here who wants to eat my face. I would quite like it subdued, please.

Id: [0x002DD52D]
Use the flat of your blade!

Id: [0x002DD52E]
Did you kill it? You weren't supposed to actually kill it! Get in here, now! I want a word with you!

Id: [0x002DD52F]
Here, you! Take your hands off my property! That ring is mine. Give it back, I say!

Id: [0x002DD530]
If I die, tell her I think only of her.

Id: [0x002DD531]
I'm going to do it! You see if I don't.

Id: [0x002DD532]
Don't try and stop me. I will get that flower … and then she'll see how much I love her.

Id: [0x002DD533]
I mean, if you insist. But I could get it if I wanted to. Just so you know.

Id: [0x002DD534]
Ran all the way from Marathon to tell the king they won the battle. Then guess what happened? He only fell down dead!

Id: [0x002DD535]
Them sissy-britches? Fat chance. So, do you want to race or not? I've beaten everyone else in the whole world.

Id: [0x002DD536]
Come on, slowpoke!

Id: [0x002DD537]
No fair! You can't leave Wincestre… I win! I win!

Id: [0x002DD53A]
I never thought I would be beaten. But you run like the wind! I am glad I had a real challenge.

Id: [0x002DD53B]
And here's another God sent to shit in my stewpot. Sod off unless you are going to magic Aelfred's jewel out your arse.

Id: [0x002DD53C]
You! What are you doing in here?

Id: [0x002DD53D]
Oi, get out of it, you!

Id: [0x002DD53E]
Return the treasure and we will forget we met.

Id: [0x002DD53F]
Holy splinters from the cross. Alright, take it.

Id: [0x002DD540]
Leave me be, I am deep in contemplation.

Id: [0x002DD541]
I have only just begun to walk in Aelfred's footsteps. But please read my scribbles. Enlighten yourself about our great king.

Id: [0x002DD542]
Please, bring me up to the bridge. I need some treatment, some medicine…

Id: [0x002DD7BC]
What is an Aesir doing here?

Id: [0x002DD7BD]
You are Eivor, yes? Of the Raven's flock. I heard you had returned. Not with war on your mind, I hope.

Id: [0x002DD7C0]
Wait … I have more poems to arose your skaldic heart. Only give me time to gather them and--

Id: [0x002DD7C1]
Shame. I've heard your voice. Clear as a bell. Larks fall from the sky in envy.

Id: [0x002DD7C2]
Come you hither to pay your respects to the great and grave King Lerion?

Id: [0x002DD7C3]
Not your best work, All-Father!

Id: [0x002DD7C4]
Hmph. Lucky.

Id: [0x002DD7C5]
Just awful! What a clown you are…

Id: [0x002DD7C6]
Not bad for an old man!

Id: [0x002DD7C7]
That was almost good…

Id: [0x002DD7C8]
This one arm has learned the tricks of both! Beware!

Id: [0x002DD7C9]
Havi! You coward! Come fight me!

Id: [0x002DD7CA]
Who am I to trick a trickster? Come, Havi, are you a prick and a coward? Grant my wish, you soft-cock!

Id: [0x002DD7CB]
Yes, my lord.

Id: [0x002DD7CC]
Skillfully done, Lore-Keeper! I will save you the juiciest cut!

Id: [0x002DD7CD]
Tarquin? My thegn, what has happened?

Id: [0x002DD7CE]
Careful! Please! This leaf cannot fall.

Id: [0x002DD7CF]
Beware. My fist has broken many smiles. Not a fun reality.

Id: [0x002DD7D0]
An Aesir? It is a dire day when even enemies must be friends. But I must beg for your help.

Id: [0x002DD7D1]
But enough of that. You are a visitor to our great land, and we know its secrets. Ask of us your questions.

Id: [0x002DD7D2]
You will be well rewarded!

Id: [0x002DD7D3]
Then we share a common foe, and I was wrong to use you like that.

Id: [0x002DD7D4]
And scream as you do. Like it is really happening.

Id: [0x002DD7D5]
Hey, stop messin' around!

Id: [0x002DD7D6]
Well well, look who's returned. You ready to smack about with the finest?

Id: [0x002DD7D7]
No need for a healer, love. Just to get to the top of that hill. I can do the rest.

Id: [0x002DD7D8]
Ha. Lying with woodland gods and living out in the wilderness, I should become a witch. What do you think, love?

Id: [0x002DD7D9]
We're not far now, love. You can leave me on the steps of the temple if you want. The rest should come naturally.

Id: [0x002DD7DA]
I'm not about to get up and run off like this, Love!

Id: [0x002DD7DB]
But have I? Or have I missed my chance? I thought I knew what lay ahead, but now that is foreign to me.

Id: [0x002DD7DC]
Untie me! Quick!

Id: [0x002DD7DD]
Wonderful! A new member. Simply place your clothes in that crate hidden by the tent and partake in the liberation.

Id: [0x002DD7DE]
Good day. Be well and beware.[hiss]

Id: [0x002DD7DF]
Then play with us! This lot's easy, but you'd be hard to find.

Id: [0x002DD7E0]
Bandits? If you hadn't been there, I dread to think. Please, keep all the treasure. Your payment for my sweet girl's life.

Id: [0x002DD7E1]
Be gentle! I don't want it bruised!

Id: [0x002DD7E2]
I'm not taking this lying down. I can tell you that for the price of a warm beer.

Id: [0x002DD7E3]
Why don't you have a look around and come back later? Dinner will not disappoint.

Id: [0x002DD7E4]
I will leave you to your day. You can find Oswald by the docks. Watching the river calms him, apparently.

Id: [0x002DD7E5]
You made it. Now tussle with care, and go easy on our future king. He is the only man left who can claim the crown.

Id: [0x002DD7E6]
Two eager Saxons is not yet a fyrd (peasant army). But you may be right. We may have a chance.

Id: [0x002DD7E7]
You have a will of iron coming here, knowing your kind did all this!

Id: [0x002DD7E8]
If you do as you promise, the pikes of Theotford will be yours.

Id: [0x002DD7E9]
In past times, that horn was used to muster fyrds all across our land. You may find others who have warmed to its call.

Id: [0x002DD7EA]
Eivor! Word of your actions in Theotford has spread like wildfire!

Id: [0x002DD7EB]
We await your return.

Id: [0x002DD7EC]
You remember the dream I spoke of?

Id: [0x002DD7ED]
If this swine is your prize, come and get him!

Id: [0x002DD7EE]
This land is rife with weakness, and you are just another blighted blot upon it.

Id: [0x002DD7EF]
If there is to be a future for both our kind, people like you and me will have to change the most to live within it.

Id: [0x002DD7F0]
Your fist is without ale! Let us address that.

Id: [0x002DD7F1]
A challenge nonetheless. What say you?

Id: [0x002DD7F2]
Bah! When you change your mind, I will be right here.

Id: [0x002DD7F3]
Waiting for you! Come now, accept my challenge. [laugh]

Id: [0x002DD7F4]
And you're no fun! It took so long to set those pots up, and I… [wincing] Ooh … ale.

Id: [0x002DD7F5]
We have you to thank for that.

Id: [0x002DD7F6]
A dream come true, like none other. Thank you for everything, from the bottom of my heart!

Id: [0x002DD7F7]
Have care you do not enjoy taking orders from anyone but your jarl back home. I fight for Sigurd, none else.

Id: [0x002DD7F8]
Only Lif! Fighting bravely. Did you know Lif carves a poem in each of his longships? He's craftsman and a wordsmith!

Id: [0x002DD7F9]
You'll have to endure my brother. He always finds new ways to humor himself.

Id: [0x002DD7FA]
Winter's chill slowing your bones?

Id: [0x002DD7FB]
With greater sense, I hope. What brings you back to Jorvik?

Id: [0x002DD7FE]
Good to hear. Have your victories in England satisfied your itch for conquest?

Id: [0x002DD7FF]
[laugh]So what brings you here? To my shores?

Id: [0x002DD800]
Take your horn. Join the battle cheer.

Id: [0x002DD801]
Join us. We are here for you.

Id: [0x002DD802]
No drink in your fist?

Id: [0x002DD803]
I'll find you something.

Id: [0x002DD804]
I'll pass it on.

Id: [0x002DD805]
But you're not getting any mead!

Id: [0x002DD806]
Do I now haunt your dreams? Do I warm your loins?

Id: [0x002DD807]
Your father's axe. The weapon of a coward, a scorn-snake.

Id: [0x002DD808]
You will be worth your weight in silver.

Id: [0x002DD809]
You move and I take your eyes. You hear me?

Id: [0x002DD80A]
But with a bureau, Basim and I could begin our work. If you have the time and spare resources to build one, we would be most grateful.

Id: [0x002DD80B]
I must say, the sight of you warms a weary heart.

Id: [0x002DD80C]
Different paths have led us here, but you are a force of nature. Like the sun. I am a timid creature, lucky to bask in your warmth.

Id: [0x002DD80D]
I've composed a verse or two about it if you'd like to hear what--

Id: [0x002DD80E]
(unintelligible)[He's a good man. One who admires you greatly.]

Id: [0x002DD80F]
Not all from me! Your name will be on the lips of every skald for years to come.

Id: [0x002DD810]
Ja. Then let's introduce you to Tewdwr.

Id: [0x002DD811]
Ah, more pagans crowding our table. Just lovely. What brings you here?

Id: [0x002DD812]
I must give away girl and land in this misty season. But Gunnar is a good man, and he speaks tirelessly of you.

Id: [0x002DD813]
O Lord, gift upon this lowly servant your greatest gift. Patience.

Id: [0x002DD814]
I am not a babe in the woods in need of constant guard. Go on without me.

Id: [0x002DD815]
So! What adventures did you find in my absence?

Id: [0x002DD816]
Then we'll turn you into a beastie, and have you roam the hills braying for sweets and drink.

Id: [0x002DD817]
Nonsense! You are the very spirit of the Mari Lwyd. Now, let's hooden!

Id: [0x002DD818]
Become the Mari Lwyd, the spirit who sings for cake and ale! And you cannot have your cloak back until we leave.

Id: [0x002DD819]
All it takes is a mask and some sweetcakes to turn you into a gentle skald.

Id: [0x002DD81A]
You're well met. Gwilim here has challenged my honor in a contest of drinks.

Id: [0x002DD81B]
Maybe you are correct. I wanted to be a cardinal, but the men who raised me said I'd serve God better as an ealdorman.

Id: [0x002DD81C]
Flaming pig. Chases you home at night. [Ono: burps]Silly words to scare silly children.

Id: [0x002DD81D]
I feel warm. Do you feel warm?

Id: [0x002DD81E]
What is the meaning of this? Blood soaking our soil, and your weapon coated in the same?

Id: [0x002DD81F]
Aye, so if you find him dead or alive, then our names should be clear. Go with the wind. I'd join you but--

Id: [0x002DD820]
And your mission?

Id: [0x002DD821]
Indeed. It's a surprise to see you. Is everything quite all right?

Id: [0x002DD822]
(unintelligible)[Modron makes her home at a clinic near the bank, look for the crooked tree.]

Id: [0x002DD823]
O spirit, you have finally come! Days ago, a passing cloud foretold your arrival with drops of sun-scented rain.

Id: [0x002DD824]
But what form of being are you beneath this guise of horse and bone? From the realm of the fae? I know you cannot say. I press no more.

Id: [0x002DD825]
Whatever you are, the spirits of straw have burst into flames as herald of your arrival. Come… Come this way.

Id: [0x002DD826]
Whatever you be, now you are here the ritual may begin! [beat]But the men of straw must announce you with sparks!

Id: [0x002DD827]
Ignite the sky to begin anew, here at the death of the season. Until then, I await you, giving thanks in the glen.

Id: [0x002DD828]
They roar! Do you hear them? A chorus of fire!

Id: [0x002DD829]
Something about your demeanor and your physical manifestation now gives me pause. Are you truly a spirit of light?

Id: [0x002DD82A]
Then prove it. You must know the depths of the world's mysteries before I will help you. Tell me the proper use of charms.

Id: [0x002DD82B]
Have you found yourself? If you are a spirit of light, answer me this…

Id: [0x002DD82C]
In such fashion, I speak to druids long dead. But of course you, a spirit, would know that.

Id: [0x002DD82D]
Tell me, O being of air and light. Which is the charm you would use to leave the past behind?

Id: [0x002DD82E]
The upturned blade! Things can be reversed! You know this charm.

Id: [0x002DD82F]
You are a spirit of light! Mabon be praised. Would you like some bread and cream?

Id: [0x002DD830]
Far enough to say it's best you stick to the countryside and wear that disguise. But Tewdwr's body has not been found as yet.

Id: [0x002DD831]
Cudd Lladron is the Welsh name for the Thieves' Warren. It's atop a hill west of here. I can lead you.

Id: [0x002DD832]
Cudd Lladron. The Thieves Warren... this is where I leave you.

Id: [0x002DD833]
There is a shrine nearby. If you've need of me, then meet me there. Gods, old and new, go with you.

Id: [0x002DD834]
Cynon may be ill and aged, but his sword arm is strong. He'll kill you first if you let him. [beat]Do not let him.

Id: [0x002DD835]
(unintelligible)[Silent about your whereabouts. But loud about missing festivities.]

Id: [0x002DD836]
He's busy with the festival and shooed me away to Brigid. Would you like to see some magic I've been practicing?

Id: [0x002DD837]
Just one trick and then I can show you around. Um, okay, so reach into this pouch…

Id: [0x002DD838]
And, the number of stones you're holding is … three!

Id: [0x002DD839]
She's like a big sister. [sulky]But it's not like I'm gonna get to see her much anymore once she leaves with you and Gunnar.

Id: [0x002DD83A]
Do you want see another trick? I can pull an acorn from your ear!

Id: [0x002DD83B]
You're not supposed to get in. No reason to enter that dump anyway. Fuck, you'd have to get me very drunk to show you inside.

Id: [0x002DD83C]
Windows! Do you know the work, the artistry that goes into making a sheet of glass into a martyr?

Id: [0x002DD83D]
Wait! Wait! One last drink before you go. A toast … to Ealdorman Cynon … or a toast to Samhain. One to the Mari Lwyd. One to … to … glass.

Id: [0x002DD83E]
Even if you have business with him, it will have to wait until the morning. Locked 'imself in, only Geva has the key.

Id: [0x002DD83F]
Actually, if you're headed that way, this crate needs to be delivered to him. Just tell Geva I sent you.

Id: [0x002DD840]
Badger mask, same as me. Should come running when she sees you. Best of luck, and Happy Samhain!

Id: [0x002DD841]
You think I mean to escape the flames? I go to the wicker man gladly.

Id: [0x002DD842]
I'm to be dead within the wicker man by Samhain's end. I beg you, let me die for my people!

Id: [0x002DD843]
Eivor. Modron will have taken Tewdwr to her forest temple. If you make haste, you might be able to stay her blade.

Id: [0x002DD844]
Ah! The crate! Yes, yes, come this way. Good you came by, Sarah was supposed to drop it off ages ago.

Id: [0x002DD845]
I should have known Cynon wouldn't have it in him to quarter you for the dogs.

Id: [0x002DD846]
You understand so little. No matter. Let me enlighten you with the fury of the gods.

Id: [0x002DD847]
A man will lie to save his skin. When you are gone, he'll gut me and burn my people. The gods showed me this.

Id: [0x002DD848]
Then I've no regrets. But I had a vision of you as well, one of a path that twists like the River Ouse.

Id: [0x002DD849]
But she ground your name to dust! Sullied the honor of herself, and her people.

Id: [0x002DD84A]
Mother saw your fate. The future will punish you greater than I ever could.

Id: [0x002DD84B]
And someone I will never forget.

Id: [0x002DD84C]
You're wasting time!

Id: [0x002DD84D]
Your father brought me here long ago, when we were just nineteen winters. Together we stacked stones into cairns.

Id: [0x002DD84E]
You win by playing, and a quiet mind is your reward. Let the air and nature's beauty soothe you.

Id: [0x002DD84F]
Ah, yes. Your mother said you had taken swiftly to the stack-of-stones. This is impressive.

Id: [0x002DD850]
[laugh]A burst of blue-air that blows to rival Njord's noisy belches! Well made, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD851]
But know this, height is not the only trait of a cairn's beauty. Shape, balance, expression are key. Seek a variety of these.

Id: [0x002DD852]
Let your only goal in this task be to surpass your own best creation.

Id: [0x002DD853]
Have you never wanted to loose your tongue and scream at someone? Throw hugr-fire and word-spears at those who anger you?

Id: [0x002DD854]
Loki would rather make enemies of friends than hear a good word about anyone but himself. Never be as Loki was.

Id: [0x002DD855]
I can think of one way to fluster him. Use all of these stones for your next cairn. He'll have none for himself.

Id: [0x002DD856]
And did your father mention Gunnar's arm ring?

Id: [0x002DD857]
Speak with your father tonight. He has a special task for you.

Id: [0x002DD858]
What is it you are building now? Two homes? Or … a hill and a mountain?

Id: [0x002DD859]
Lean on me. I will lead you home.

Id: [0x002DD85A]
I said nothing of the sort, troll-tooth! That is the All-Father whispering into your big head.

Id: [0x002DD85B]
Snow like arrows? The skald in you speaks! I admit, it does calm me down some.

Id: [0x002DD85C]
Yes. And when your eyes command rain, it pours hot drops, your smile craves sun, the clouds part like curtains.

Id: [0x002DD85D]
You are quite good at this, these cairns. Better than me, that I admit.

Id: [0x002DD85E]
This one is your masterpiece. A monument to the gods. Now bask in their glory and receive their honor.

Id: [0x002DD85F]
Do you often think of your father?

Id: [0x002DD860]
Do you believe him a coward?

Id: [0x002DD861]
You should win back the honor he lost.

Id: [0x002DD862]
I know you will.

Id: [0x002DD863]
You will join my pile of bones.

Id: [0x002DD864]
Darkness must reign. And you must fade within it!

Id: [0x002DD865]
Now you face the end!

Id: [0x002DD866]
I will tear you apart.

Id: [0x002DD867]
You will not infect me!

Id: [0x002DD868]
If I take you, I will be closer.

Id: [0x002DD869]
But now I hold nothing back. If I must take your eyes, I will.

Id: [0x002DD86A]
Liar, liar, liar! You will join them, all the unkind dead! Now I open the scars of my heart!

Id: [0x002DD86B]
Breathe deeply! Watch as I become smoke … and listen as I break your bones!

Id: [0x002DD86C]
You lucked out with that one.

Id: [0x002DD86D]
They're right! You are awful at this.

Id: [0x002DD86E]
A resonant thought. Now will you oblige me? An honorable and clean battle is all I ask for now.

Id: [0x002DD86F]
I bid you farewell then. To a later moon. When the sky is crisp.

Id: [0x002DD870]
Ah, my wounds bleed clean! Thank you for this last song of well-wrought iron and immaculate blows.

Id: [0x002DD871]
My life has had many chapters. Ragnar Lothbrok himself started as a farmer, you know. He often envied my choice.

Id: [0x002DD872]
I scare myself. Not a thread of decency remains. The drengr I was, I have lost him. Would you end this suffering? For me?

Id: [0x002DD873]
Yes. You know my pain. And you look as though you could end it. Do this, then, a final kindness for an unworthy wretch.

Id: [0x002DD874]
You honor me with your skill and ferocity. That is all that matters.

Id: [0x002DD875]
I hope you will. Let me now prepare the shield wall. Lord Ragnar, will this be the day?

Id: [0x002DD876]
This is a mere moment. No one will remember it. No one. Not your name, nor mine. It all ends up the same.

Id: [0x002DD877]
Thank you for bringing Arne back into my arms! I would like to repay your kindness.

Id: [0x002DD878]
Wh-what are you saying…? You want me to forget my brother?

Id: [0x002DD879]
You'll be back. They all come back.

Id: [0x002DD87A]
Let's see if you don't take a fall against the one they call The Wall, Edward of Lincoln.

Id: [0x002DD87B]
I've never been in such a fight, you walloped me with all your might.

Id: [0x002DD87C]
Please, you must fight for me. Who knows what lurks below? What vile people might come to harm me!

Id: [0x002DD87D]
Just … stand at the door below. That will place you directly between me and any bad, bad men.

Id: [0x002DD87E]
What! No! No no no! You…[sigh] I suppose that's it, then …

Id: [0x002DD87F]
You! How dare you!

Id: [0x002DD880]
It's our grandfather. And be careful unless you want a walloping.

Id: [0x002DD881]
Many cowards have said the same! He uses only one fist. One wallop. Boom! Like a wolf howling with its knuckles!

Id: [0x002DD882]
I beg you. There is no need for this to go where I feel you think it should.

Id: [0x002DD883]
You best depart unless you desire your face become a fist cave.

Id: [0x002DD884]
There you have it. As promised. Banal victory for me and my wallop.

Id: [0x002DD885]
I have never been bested before. I am shocked! Stunned! I never thought it possible. You have thwarted my wallop.

Id: [0x002DD886]
You may have access to the treasure my wallop has sadly gifted me over the years. Various awards for bashing skulls.

Id: [0x002DD887]
Still unbeaten. Why, God? Come back if you want another taste of my endless victory. I know I don't want you to.

Id: [0x002DD888]
If you want the wallop, it will ruin your life. It has ruined many already.

Id: [0x002DD889]
You know, there is a great meadhall nearby. We could go there and reflect on our greatest exploits.

Id: [0x002DD88A]
Just skalds and warriors full of mead and story-greed. O, yes, let me weave you a hero's saga from dirt and spittle.

Id: [0x002DD88B]
My arms are numb from battle. Does it need any dressing? Do you think it is a serious wound?

Id: [0x002DD88C]
Ah. Valhalla, it is. I appreciate your candid response. Now I prepare myself for the sights and sounds of the Corpse Hall.

Id: [0x002DD88D]
I will let you drink my famous ale from my famous barley. "Sebbi's Slush," they call it in town. They do!

Id: [0x002DD88E]
If you ever change your mind, come baa-ck here! The warmest winter to you!

Id: [0x002DD88F]
You, have a pie for the trouble.

Id: [0x002DD890]
In the shadow of God's protection, I … I trust I will. But … please don't tell anyone you've seen me.

Id: [0x002DD891]
If I can get Cynewulf's bastardly face to help me with this meter. But you will have my thanks in this performance regardless.

Id: [0x002DD892]
I, Cynewulf, have been freed from my bondage and am eternally in your debt.

Id: [0x002DD893]
I've a guess who your friend is, and no. Osbert cannot have his greasy pedestrian fingers on something so exquisite.

Id: [0x002DD894]
Uh, free of charge. Let me just grab it for you.

Id: [0x002DD895]
O-o, that is … thank you. Well. I should hope so! You may take the legionnaire.

Id: [0x002DD896]
I'll make this noise, caw-caw, if he's coming your way. And you make it when you've got the thing.

Id: [0x002DD897]
Come, if you have courage!

Id: [0x002DD898]
But maybe you would be moved to help by the bounty King Harald has offered for any warlock killed.

Id: [0x002DD899]
You may claim his belongings. His body I will give to the land.

Id: [0x002DD89A]
No, he is still young and fit. It was not always so. You could not keep us apart when we were raiding.

Id: [0x002DD89B]
Maybe you could start by breaking things?

Id: [0x002DD89C]
You could keep it. Comb your hair. Or, I could comb it if you like.

Id: [0x002DD89D]
I could do more than comb your hair, find all your knots and snags and tame them … if you'd like.

Id: [0x002DD89E]
Hark! Pict reinforcements!

Id: [0x002DD89F]
What a fight! The Pict King Constantin will feel a little lighter in the purse tomorrow. Thank you for your aid, uh…?

Id: [0x002DD8A0]
See if you can hit one of the targets above.

Id: [0x002DD8A1]
Yeh! I bet you can't hit that… uhhh… that chicken, right o'er there! The one hanging from the pole!

Id: [0x002DD8A2]
Can you tell the stones to stay still, please? I need to build a stone man so it will protect me from the Pict-people!

Id: [0x002DD8A3]
A favor, I beg of you. Slay me so I may join them in Helheim and beg their forgiveness.

Id: [0x002DD8A4]
Hey! What's going on? Are you all right up there?

Id: [0x002DD8A5]
You are still up there, aren't you?

Id: [0x002DD8A6]
Um, have you got it yet?

Id: [0x002DD8A7]
Eivor, eh? Er … well, maybe just something that rhymes with it, then? Would that do?

Id: [0x002DD8A8]
Flopsy! Lord Snuffles! What have they done to you?

Id: [0x002DD8A9]
Look at her scowling now! Face like a bulldog licking piss off a nettle! See what I must wake up to each morn?

Id: [0x002DD8AA]
Apologies will be cold comfort to Flopsy in his barrow tonight. But it is not you I blame. Gerhild is the villain here, as always.

Id: [0x002DD8AB]
Ha! Come and prove it, then! Saxon, give us a song!

Id: [0x002DD8AC]
I'll grant you the long peace of the grave!

Id: [0x002DD8AD]
A sorry necessity. We three were left homeless after your country folk, er, burned our village to ashes.

Id: [0x002DD8AE]
O, we most certainly are that. The Three Wisps salute you, and bid you safe journey from our swamp.

Id: [0x002DD8AF]
Do you? Or did you hear the chime of my coin purse?

Id: [0x002DD8B0]
Who are you?

Id: [0x002DD8B1]
Wait. What? What is this?

Id: [0x002DD8B2]
What in God's name? You brute!

Id: [0x002DD8B3]
He will be. I have watched him for many turns of the sun. And now he will know of my burning love. Thanks to you.

Id: [0x002DD8B4]
And did you bring me pretty flowers? To weave within my golden locks?

Id: [0x002DD8B5]
It's just been a while since anyone passed this way, and I wanted to be sure you would stay and visit.

Id: [0x002DD8B6]
You are right. She was always so happy, laughing and singing. It would break her heart to see me so forlorn.

Id: [0x002DD8B7]
Aye? Did you have more to say?

Id: [0x002DD8B8]
It is an embarrassing situation. Just leave your offering on the ground, please.

Id: [0x002DD8B9]
I tried to swindle you, so what? Life is tough! It's good business being a dead man.

Id: [0x002DD8BA]
Do you like it? My wife and I have constructed it from ancient stones.

Id: [0x002DD8BB]
When I say "far" I mean to distant lands beyond your imagination. Each brick of this castle is a memory from our adventures.

Id: [0x002DD8BC]
From our window we can relive our adventures. There she is, now.

Id: [0x002DD8BD]
If you want, some try and do the same with their bow. But my best time is hard to beat.

Id: [0x002DD8BE]
Those stuffed targets are hard to see if your eye is slow!

Id: [0x002DD8BF]
A fellow romantic soul. Perhaps you might be able to aid my plight.

Id: [0x002DD8C0]
I beg your pardon?

Id: [0x002DD8C1]
O-o! I suppose! I'm not sure what that means, but it is pretty. Are you composing a poem in my likeness?

Id: [0x002DD8C2]
A girl. I've no knowledge of warriors or what to name them.[beat] How about your name, then? Little Eivor.

Id: [0x002DD8C3]
If only Rose were here. She would help me.

Id: [0x002DD8C4]
Rose? Is that you? It is! My daughter, my child! I can scarcely believe it.

Id: [0x002DD8C5]
I've been longing to speak to you again.

Id: [0x002DD8C6]
Rose, Rose, do not jest with your father and his failing eyes.

Id: [0x002DD8C7]
Such a pleasure to have you at my side, Rose. But I'm so tired, so very tired. I cannot move those crates to shelter.

Id: [0x002DD8C8]
Yes, Rose. Right there. You were always very clever, child. Put the others there, as well.

Id: [0x002DD8C9]
Rose! You've grown up to be quite strong!

Id: [0x002DD8CA]
That's the last of them. Come join me, Rose. It's been ages since we had a chat.

Id: [0x002DD8CB]
Rose, you're such a help. Let us reminisce, shall we? The tale of how I courted your mother?

Id: [0x002DD8CC]
You never tire of that one. Well. As a young man, I was sent to a great lord to help with his livestock.

Id: [0x002DD8CD]
What? O, yes. What was I saying? Ah, your mother and I in the storeroom. Yes. Well.

Id: [0x002DD8CE]
Your mother had a quick wit. "Why master," she said. "This boy can fetch you more milk than you'd ever have use for."

Id: [0x002DD8CF]
"In a thrice, master," your mother said, and we ran outside. "How will we get more?" I asked. "The cows are spent!"[snore]

Id: [0x002DD8D0]
Yes? O. "The cows are spent!" Your mother bade me not to be a ninny. She led me in a circle back to the buckets in the shade.

Id: [0x002DD8D1]
Not long after, you were born. The pinkest little babe a father could hope for! We named you Rose, after the cow.

Id: [0x002DD8D2]
That reminds me - your mother's ring! She wanted you to have it. Here.

Id: [0x002DD8D3]
Such a sweet girl. I'll bequeath it to you when the time comes.

Id: [0x002DD8D4]
Rose! You've returned. Sit with me, I'll tell you a tale from my youth.

Id: [0x002DD8D5]
Such a delight to see you, Rose. Come back soon!

Id: [0x002DD8D6]
White roses. Once we named you, it became your mother's favorite flower.

Id: [0x002DD8D7]
The rosebush we planted by your mother's grave has grown all the way up the old oak tree. You remember, it's just outside there.

Id: [0x002DD8D8]
Remember Fidelis? He would never leave your side.

Id: [0x002DD8D9]
You and your mother made all our clothes. You were always a danger with a needle.

Id: [0x002DD8DA]
How should I know? I told you. I cannot explain how it works. What I can say is the elixir hit you particularly hard.

Id: [0x002DD8DB]
And here I thought all Danes were ruthless plunderers. Murderers! You have a soul that would grace the heavens. Like my Sphinxy. Lord light your way.

Id: [0x002DD8DC]
Do you think you can you stop him? Because I cannot.

Id: [0x002DD8DD]
Thank you for the advice, and for your trouble … which is now my problem…[sigh]

Id: [0x002DD8DE]
Please, do not distract us! We're trying to solve a problem here.

Id: [0x002DD8DF]
A reward, yes, I understand your meaning. Bring me the eggs and it will be done.

Id: [0x002DD8E0]
As we agreed. Well? Have you nothing to say after such a forceful breaking of wind?

Id: [0x002DD8E1]
Inside, you will find a few of my most prized items. Take them. I no longer have any need.

Id: [0x002DD8E2]
Eivor. If the gods will it, I will find my seat at Odin's table before you.

Id: [0x002DD8E3]
And there I will speak of you, so that when the time comes to claim your seat, they will greet you by name. Farewell.

Id: [0x002DD8E4]
You would help us?

Id: [0x002DD8E5]
Helping you! What does it look like?

Id: [0x002DD8E6]
You wouldn't happen to be carrying an eel would you?

Id: [0x002DD8E7]
Toss it in the pot, will you please? I've fished everything in Ledecestre but the eel.

Id: [0x002DD8E8]
Of course, for your palate is far less tainted than mine. Take a generous amount, too.

Id: [0x002DD8E9]
Ah, it's you! Have you brought me an eel?

Id: [0x002DD8EA]
If I could ask one more favor of you, it would be to take this failure to the grottos below my home. I can't stand the sight of it.

Id: [0x002DD8EB]
Hah! You jest, but I shall take you up on it. Until then!

Id: [0x002DD8EC]
O! It's you!

Id: [0x002DD8ED]
This is far enough. You can put him down.

Id: [0x002DD8EE]
You and your foul brothers and sisters have churned the very soil of this sacred land. No more!

Id: [0x002DD8EF]
O, yes. Snakebit. Just like you!

Id: [0x002DD8F0]
If you like I have a luminous text with my teachings. A breviary of why one must trust their body's exposed sinew. Enjoy!

Id: [0x002DD8F1]
They should get some air. Sssshh... I guess I am like this Freyja you spoke of. O, I should release them and use them as warriors. O...

Id: [0x002DD8F2]
Enough. I should not have attacked you. Just don't hurt my babies.

Id: [0x002DD8F3]
Welcome to Aelfheim! If I had my eyes, I would show you its splendor myself!

Id: [0x002DD8F4]
To you I offer this arm ring, in exchange for my loyalty. Find the ring among the wreck and you may call a king your friend.

Id: [0x002DD8F5]
O! These apples explode in your mouth with the iridescent light of Jesus.

Id: [0x002DD8F6]
O, eternal thanks for carrying the crate!

Id: [0x002DD8F7]
O I am so excited for you see my friend and eat apples with us. The act of walking, the pilgrimage we are going on!

Id: [0x002DD8F8]
Without anger in my life, I am completely changed, no longer obsessed with riches, like you.

Id: [0x002DD8F9]
Yes, burn it down. Make a pyre of the past.

Id: [0x002DD8FA]
Go ahead and slaughter my livestock. It is not something I wish to do, but I would gladly allow you to do it.

Id: [0x002DD8FB]
I was just like you, a stupid heathen, lost and violent. Speaking of which, you should try praying before it is too late.

Id: [0x002DD8FC]
Fuck it! I am still the blood-hungry whore I once was! Fucking die you putrid shit-eater! Die a thousand ways and times like the others!

Id: [0x002DD8FD]
It's dead of night. You lie unaware.<LF>A terrible sight comes up from her lair.

Id: [0x002DD8FE]
[laugh]Alright, alright, you did cause a fright. Take a sweet reward.

Id: [0x002DD8FF]
I have-- I have-- Cakes. Mummy made. Here!

Id: [0x002DD900]
Ah, have a cake for your troubles, then.

Id: [0x002DD901]
Haha! Here, then. Sweets for the Mari Lwyd, you've earned it.

Id: [0x002DD902]
Ooh, ghosts and beasties. Here, spirit, take your reward.

Id: [0x002DD903]
I can feel this Norse magic running from my fingers to my toes. I bet I can beat you in a race back to that body!

Id: [0x002DD904]
Wait! No! I'll give it back, just … just no battle to the death!

Id: [0x002DD905]
O... Just a few broken … but the smell will be here for weeks. Huh… Still, you have my thanks.

Id: [0x002DD906]
You've given me my freedom … but at great cost. Still, you have my thanks.

Id: [0x002DD907]
Ja, the current's too strong to pull the wreck out, so we're left to lament the loss. You interested?

Id: [0x002DD908]
Then by all means, we can scrape together a reward fit for the cargo's rescue.

Id: [0x002DD909]
A message in a bottle? [beat, as if reading]Ah, wise. Hid a necklace in a cow's stomach. Guess you'll have to go fishing for the rest of the treasure.

Id: [0x002DD90A]
I am at complete peace with the world. Can you say as much?

Id: [0x002DD90B]
A curious response, for the meek shall inherit the earth.

Id: [0x002DD90C]
I shall pray for you. Now, if you'll forgive me.

Id: [0x002DD90D]
I will follow you, if only to feel the grass beneath my feet. I will repent when I return.

Id: [0x002DD90E]
You're no help. My brother is swimming around this pond!

Id: [0x002DD90F]
And it worked! If you like, you could leave us the fish anyway. We'll swap 'em for brittle at the market.

Id: [0x002DD910]
O, right. You're the victim.

Id: [0x002DD911]
What are you whistling at me for? I'm not a dog. Lord give me strength.

Id: [0x002DD912]
Good riddance, too!

Id: [0x002DD913]
All my lovelies! You monster!

Id: [0x002DD914]
I hear you out there. The witch locked me in and left the key somewhere. Find that key!

Id: [0x002DD915]
Hello? This is the slowest rescue I've ever seen! Could you find the stupid key and get me out?

Id: [0x002DD916]
I warn you, stop!

Id: [0x002DD917]
Huh... You again!

Id: [0x002DD918]
No, that's not how it works! You need to say the password!

Id: [0x002DD919]
Ooo! That's better than the one I came up with! Okay, it's Raven from now on. Come in!

Id: [0x002DD91A]
This shoe has magical properties. You'll see when you put it on.

Id: [0x002DD91B]
We stuffed some paper in it to keep it from wrinkling, so you get the paper too.

Id: [0x002DD91C]
Awww! Fine, then. Come back when you're not being such a grump-bags.

Id: [0x002DD91D]
I'm not coming out. And you're not coming in!

Id: [0x002DD91E]
Norse scum! You can rot out there!

Id: [0x002DD91F]
You can take all the treasures of Canterbury, but you will not have this!

Id: [0x002DD920]
Get away! You will not have it! This is the king's property!

Id: [0x002DD921]
All that honey must have given you quite a thirst.

Id: [0x002DD922]
Does yours put you in the maw of death every opportunity he gets?

Id: [0x002DD923]
Then may it bring you more luck than it did us. Maybe you will even solve the serpent's mystery.

Id: [0x002DD924]
None. You drink. Pig speaks.

Id: [0x002DD925]
White and red war. Thirty years, the sons of the licentious lion tear at the earth and sod. Shame on him who thinks ill of it.

Id: [0x002DD926]
Smack your lips, for you shall be the king's suckling sauce.[ONO human pig squealing noises and laughing]

Id: [0x002DD927]
Please, I beg you. How many are there? I must know.

Id: [0x002DD928]
See! Never the same, never the same. Please… Count them again, you must, to save my wits!

Id: [0x002DD929]
You should not stay here. Leave, leave before they claim you!

Id: [0x002DD92A]
How dare you touch those sacred arrows! You've desecrated a martyr's place!

Id: [0x002DD92B]
That depends on your opinion of King Edmund. I wonder… I have studied those arrows, but never dared touch them.

Id: [0x002DD92C]
I would pay heavy coin for them. I'm a sage, a chronicler of histories. Return to me if you desire riches.

Id: [0x002DD92D]
Thank you … but I do not think we deserve this.

Id: [0x002DD92E]
Father was a good horse summoner, I'll have you know. I will rise in his stead!

Id: [0x002DD92F]
You're a monster. Once I master the summoning arts, I will banish you!

Id: [0x002DD930]
You hide good for someone so big!

Id: [0x002DD931]
And He has told me much about you, too.

Id: [0x002DD932]
May God strike you down!

Id: [0x002DD933]
Wow! Nali hasn't let anyone touch him since old Kottr died. But he sure loves you!

Id: [0x002DD934]
Good, you know of it. From my pain, life springs. [groan]Please, help me to the clearing. The field needs the blood-mead.

Id: [0x002DD935]
Ah, but when has a giant stood beneath a roof of water? Perhaps you are not up to the challenge.

Id: [0x002DD936]
Ha! A tragically romantic guess that speaks much of you. But no… that is not the right answer.

Id: [0x002DD937]
Long eaten. But take this instead.

Id: [0x002DD938]
Do not pout. Have a reward much more worthy of your talents.

Id: [0x002DD939]
I do not get many visitors. Your presence sparked my mind. A rare thing out here.

Id: [0x002DD93A]
Come back here and untie me! There are wolves, bears! You will be sorry when I am eaten! Who will sing of your deeds then?

Id: [0x002DD93B]
I cannot, for walking in your footsteps has let me sup at the cup of inspiration. You are my life's great purpose.

Id: [0x002DD93C]
Money? You offend me. I am an artist, grubby coin does not sustain me. Poetry is my bread and mead.

Id: [0x002DD93D]
At last I can continue my epic tale of your exploits. It was just getting good.

Id: [0x002DD93E]
Epping Forest is full of it. And Lady Trotters finds it. [beat]Ah, she has the scent! Come, I'll show you.

Id: [0x002DD93F]
A lost cause. I'm going for a nap. If Lady runs off, follow her, would you? What she finds we'll share. [beat]The socks are all yours.

Id: [0x002DD940]
I'm taking the beast over your dead body.

Id: [0x002DD941]
Did she, now? Well, you must have the knack. She does not take to strangers kindly. Do you, girl?

Id: [0x002DD942]
Aye, she does. I will never find another friend like her. Well, goodbye. Fare safe on your travels.

Id: [0x002DD943]
Hey, you! Can you swim? Our father's down there, looking for treasure.

Id: [0x002DD944]
You mean … he drowned?

Id: [0x002DD945]
My husband fishes there, yes, and I run the stall. Do you fancy some fine, fresh fish?

Id: [0x002DD946]
I merely sung the truth! Your brutish threats hold no power over a bard like me.

Id: [0x002DD947]
Y-you're right. I cannot hold on any longer to what is already lost. I will go.

Id: [0x002DD948]
Are you here to steal Aldwyn from me? [sigh]But of course, his handsome face is a sight to behold!

Id: [0x002DD949]
Depends on who you talk to. Mostly good. Do not worry about the bad.

Id: [0x002DD94A]
That one is so thick, he could shatter your shield, but the other men like him. And those are the best of the bunch.

Id: [0x002DD94B]
No, no, I will be fine. And do not worry about me, worry about yourself!

Id: [0x002DD94C]
It was an honor beating you.

Id: [0x002DD94D]
Take some silver for your trouble, and a little extra. For cheating you and Sigurd on that raid. Good luck!

Id: [0x002DD94E]
What would you say to a piece of Christ's cross? Snakeskin from Ragnar Lothbrok's death pit?

Id: [0x002DD94F]
That was the helmet Halfdan the Black wore when he died in battle. It will protect you and bring good crops.

Id: [0x002DD950]
No silver! It was not like that! I was there that night, but I did not fight for Kjotve! I ran…

Id: [0x002DD951]
Loki curse you!

Id: [0x002DD952]
May the gods grant you better luck than I have seen!

Id: [0x002DD953]
You can borrow my horse, but I expect you to finish the job.

Id: [0x002DD954]
May the gods grant you luck for your efforts.

Id: [0x002DD955]
You missed a few things.

Id: [0x002DD956]
No! I want to live! And I could not possibly hope to win against you.

Id: [0x002DD957]
Many from Norway find the trip dizzying, but fortunately, you have me to guide you. I know the land better than my own son.

Id: [0x002DD958]
Tell your Pictish master that you will never take England!

Id: [0x002DD959]
Who in Hel's name are you? Why are you going through my things?

Id: [0x002DD95A]
It does not matter what you tell me is real. This is what I believe. I believe Alfred has sold us out to the Picts!

Id: [0x002DD95B]
From the fertile power and energy it holds. I must see it for myself. Will you protect me on the road?

Id: [0x002DD95C]
And know this. If you ever return, you'll be punished for your crimes. Come, Griseld, I shall be your rock now.

Id: [0x002DD95D]
If I die, it'll be your fault, you know. Do you want that on your conscience? Do you?

Id: [0x002DD95E]
Gratitude? That was my prize fighting bear you killed. How am I supposed to make my living now?

Id: [0x002DD95F]
O, thank you, Your Majesty! Please accept my eternal loyalty for condemning me to abject poverty!

Id: [0x002DD960]
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

Id: [0x002DD961]
I'm not stopping even if you do fall and break all your legs.

Id: [0x002DD963]
Do you like interesting places? I've run all over Wessex. Found some scary, spooky, magic spots!

Id: [0x002DD964]
I'll give you my diary. I call it, The Many Wondrous Runnings of the Galloping Miracle Legs. Bye-bye!

Id: [0x002DD965]
Sorry, my beef is not with you. I only ask for what coin is fair. It cost me double to make over what was agreed. I have a wife to feed.

Id: [0x002DD966]
Gladly. And I don't care whether you give it to Cedric or not. He has all the finesse of a mad cow in bloomers.

Id: [0x002DD967]
Well, I didn't ask for your help, but I am glad of it. Aelfred commissioned this rare thing.

Id: [0x002DD968]
What? No, I… God's pearly tooth! Here's payment for you and we will both forget this meeting.

Id: [0x002DD9BF]
Someday you too will disappear.

Id: [0x002DDC15]
An immense victory! [laughing]Dare you reclaim your honor? I'm willing to give you a chance.

Id: [0x002DDC16]
Stings to lose so badly, does it not? [laughing]Fancy another game?

Id: [0x002DDC18]
Are you going to walk away now with your head hung in defeat? Let us play again!

Id: [0x002DDC19]
Tough luck! Try again?

Id: [0x002DDC1B]
Orlog! A game of skill! Or luck. [laughing]How about a game?

Id: [0x002DDC1C]
Yes! Orlog! Join me?

Id: [0x002DDC1D]
Sit, sit! The dice won't roll themselves!

Id: [0x002DDC1F]
Yes!

Id: [0x002DDC20]
How do you like that!

Id: [0x002DDC21]
The end is nigh for you!

Id: [0x002DDC23]
Straight and to the point! May the best hand win!

Id: [0x002DDC24]
Alright then, let us begin!

Id: [0x002DDC25]
I am pretty good. Do not say I did not warn you.

Id: [0x002DDC27]
No, no, no!

Id: [0x002DDC28]
Go easy on me, will you?

Id: [0x002DDC29]
Ugh! Not like this.

Id: [0x002DDC2B]
Aye, this is not good for me.

Id: [0x002DDC2C]
This does not bode well…

Id: [0x002DDC2D]
Not good ... not good.

Id: [0x002DDC2F]
Aye, if you change your mind, I will be here.

Id: [0x002DDC30]
The dice will not roll themselves, you know!

Id: [0x002DDC31]
Off with you then.

Id: [0x002DDC33]
A few blows from death now, stranger!

Id: [0x002DDC34]
I have cornered you now.

Id: [0x002DDC35]
This game is as good as over!

Id: [0x002DDC37]
Leaving just like that? I thought better of you! Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002DDC38]
Come back soon, you are good company.[laughing]

Id: [0x002DDC3A]
The gods favored your hand today. Shall we go again?

Id: [0x002DDC3B]
Bah! You just got lucky. Another round?

Id: [0x002DDC3D]
What is going on here?

Id: [0x002DDC3E]
Look at that!

Id: [0x002DDC3F]
Wow!

Id: [0x002DDC41]
This cannot be! I challenge you to another round!

Id: [0x002DDC42]
How did - What - No! Again!

Id: [0x002DDC44]
Come! A little dice never caused any harm.

Id: [0x002DDC45]
I have not had a win all day. I must turn this around.

Id: [0x002DDC46]
Sit awhile and play, friend!

Id: [0x002DDC47]
You look like you know a thing or two about dice.

Id: [0x002DDC48]
Can I interest you in a game of Orlog?

Id: [0x002DDC4A]
Very good.

Id: [0x002DDC4B]
You are really good at this.

Id: [0x002DDC4C]
How did you do that?

Id: [0x002DDC4E]
Prepare yourself![laughing]

Id: [0x002DDC4F]
Now we are talking! Prepare yourself!

Id: [0x002DDC51]
Oh! Come on!

Id: [0x002DDC52]
Will you not stay down?

Id: [0x002DDC53]
You are testing my patience.

Id: [0x002DDC55]
You are a tough one!

Id: [0x002DDC56]
Just give up, already!

Id: [0x002DDC57]
So close!

Id: [0x002DDC5B]
No, no, come on, Shaun. Turn that thing off. Oh, hold on, I like what you said there. I want to get this for posterity. Say it again. Nice and loud. [sigh]Seriously? Sure, come on. If nothing else, it'll give me leverage with your old man. Ah. That's your angle … nice. [sigh]What I said was … I wish I hadn't been born into the Assassins. I wish I had chosen this life. Is that good enough? Sure, but why is that? Because … because choice is the central idea of our creed. It underpins everything, right? It's about free will. It's about seeing the evidence before you and saying, "Yes, this is what I want," or "No, this isn't for me." But when you're born into a group like this or any other, like I was … you get mixed signals. You get told over and over again, "This is what we believe. These are the rules. This is reality. No deviation." And if you question it, oh, they look at you like you … like you killed a puppy. That's hardly free will. It's a weird irony when free will is your central belief, but nobody wants you to believe otherwise. I don't know how to say it exactly, but I always thought there was something … self-destructive about our creed. If free will is the most important moral guidepost we have, we should be free to ignore it. To choose submission, for example. You know what I mean? Like, we should be free to side with the Templars. If it's really my choice, I could do that. Right. It's almost self-refuting. A democracy could democratically elect a dictator or choose to get rid of democracy altogether. Within our creed is the seed of its own destruction. That's what makes it powerful, I think … and fragile. Right, right. The more freedom you have, the more risky it is, you know? Anyway, my dad has mellowed over the years. But he was strict when we lived on the farm. He ran a tight ship. I never got the impression that I was free to choose my path forward. Our creed, our tenets, they were drilled into my head. By the time I was a teenager, I was following these rules out of a sense of duty. This was … just what we did. That happens to a lot of organizations over time. A stagnation sets in, you know? A fundamentalism. Yeah. Following the rules becomes more important than achieving whatever goal you set out for yourself. And people start to lose sight of the reason the rules exist. That's called deontology, or a form of it. Following a rule for its own sake, and not for the consequences it has. Yeah. But that feels backwards, doesn't it? Well, I think so. Following a rule is the easy part. Praying, taking a sip of wine, munching on a wafer. Rituals that give comfort. But that's just going through the motions. It makes people feel like they're doing something. When the hard work is … well, actually getting off your ass and doing something productive! I think people just want boundaries. Tight boundaries. They want to see the four walls that pen them in. I don't disagree. Anything outside that, anything that makes life more complex. That's scary. That's why I envy you. You chose this life. You went through that process, and you decided, "Yes, I believe in this." Sure. It didn't stop me from being an insufferable know-it-all as a teenager. But I see your point. I would have loved to have been a know-it-all. I knew nothing. Not until you guys found me. Yeah. It wasn't until I met you and Becs and Lucy that I knew … I knew I wanted to be an Assassin. Ah oh… Thanks, Des. Come here. Bring it in, bud. I don't normally like touching, but I'll make an exception now. [laugh]I am not hugging you. You sure? 'Cause I smell very nice today. Can you just turn that off?

Who might you be, Dane? His new leash?

Id: [0x002DEA1D]
Only taking care of our prized drengr.

Id: [0x002DEA1E]
Good day to you, stranger.

Id: [0x002DEA1F]
Thank you for staying your hand, stranger. What is your name?

Id: [0x002DEA20]
Wait, warrior. There were … two …

Id: [0x002DEA21]
Get your rest, warrior. I'll stand vigil with prayer.

Id: [0x002DEA22]
Should you remain in England, you too will one day be her subject.

Id: [0x002DEA23]
I called you Raven-Feeder once. At Portcestre, you were hotheaded as Thor. You have become a true leader, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEA24]
No. When I heard of a mighty warrior in the west, who brings terror to the Saxons … I came to join you. If you'll have me?

Id: [0x002DEA25]
Come, Raven-Feeder, do your worst.

Id: [0x002DEA28]
Loki! Your champion has fallen! Reward me! [beat]Where is Loki Rabbit? He's … he's gone!

Thank you, stranger, I thought this was my last day on Midgard.

Id: [0x002DEA6A]

Id: [0x002DEA6B]
Well fought.

Id: [0x002DEAAD]
Havi, stop!

Id: [0x002DEAB1]
You! You look stronger than most of the others. What's your name?

Id: [0x002DEAB2]
Jora as in "Horse"?

Id: [0x002DEAB3]
You ask too many questions, Horse. Your task is to keep your mouth shut and do as I tell you. Now unload that ship and--

Id: [0x002DEAB4]
That's Olav's job, Horse. Not yours. You stick to this port and keep your head down!

Id: [0x002DEAB5]
O, stay clear of Gorm, then. He is not a good man, not a good man at all. Why would you need to see such a terrible man?

Id: [0x002DEAB6]
And they are all well-armed. Not like you! As well-equipped as a stable hand.

Id: [0x002DEAB7]
For one reason only, I see. You snake.

Id: [0x002DEAB8]
Eivor, you return to us.

Id: [0x002DEAB9]
Ready to lift an oar on our long voyage back to England?

Id: [0x002DEABA]
It is. Are you ready to head back?

Id: [0x002DEABE]
The Temple is yours to explore, Eivor. It's to the east of here. I must wear my Reeve's face for a time.

Id: [0x002DEAC5]
We thought you wouldn't come if you knew it was just a dog.

Id: [0x002DEAC6]
But you go off on your own all the time!

Id: [0x002DEAC7]
Eivor. You seem to be someone with a penchant for … trophies.

Id: [0x002DEAC8]
Ah, you're back.

Id: [0x002DEAC9]
Careful, they're aggressive!

Id: [0x002DEACA]
O, thank you! Thank you so much! Both of you!

Id: [0x002DEACB]
This was grand, Eivor. You hunt almost as well as you fight.

Id: [0x002DEACC]
You are the first on my list, Eivor. See you soon.

Id: [0x002DEACD]
That leads below ground to who knows where. Let's keep our wits about us.

Id: [0x002DEACE]
And what are you and Petra doing out here, lurking about the woods. Hunting maybe?

Id: [0x002DEACF]
Eivor. Stop! I'm here!

Id: [0x002DEAD0]
We have been here before…

Id: [0x002DEAD1]
Gods. I was worried you would never feel the same. I mean, you're always away living adventures and--

Id: [0x002DEAD2]
Have I been at the table so long that you forget how well I wield a sword?

Id: [0x002DEAD3]
Yes, indeed, my lord. I shall follow your order to the letter.

Id: [0x002DEAD4]
I thought you wanted to do this in secret?

Id: [0x002DEAD5]
That was a thrill, Eivor. We are champions of Grantebridge! Do you know of any other towns that need liberating?

Id: [0x002DEAD6]
Eivor, our outing has hardly begun. Find us an ale house and let us make ourselves at home.

Id: [0x002DEAD7]
Careful Eivor! Falling behind.

Id: [0x002DEAD8]
It's a sunken tower near a waterfall, close to home. We can stop for a look and then you are free of me.

Id: [0x002DEAD9]
Eivor, entangled by a hardy jarlskona as she leads her army to victory and prosperity. A rather appealing match.

Id: [0x002DEADA]
Sigurd is your brother and I … I have put you in a very difficult position. The heart does not do politics like the head.

Id: [0x002DEADB]
A question, Eivor. You are a warrior, a fighter, that much I know. But if you could stop fighting, what would you do?

Id: [0x002DEADC]
It won't look like much, Eivor. But don't be fooled. And don't take Wilf lightly, charming as he seems. The man is a serpent.

Id: [0x002DEADD]
Guthban, my boy! As I live and breathe, you got my message! And you've brought a friend.

Id: [0x002DEADE]
You're a fiery one. I like that. But the ink was dried on this deal well before your number arrived in England.

Id: [0x002DEADF]
Eivor, this isn't your fight. You don't need to do this.

Id: [0x002DEAE0]
No vow stands above my duty to my friends, Eivor. I could not leave you alone with them should they attack.

Id: [0x002DEAE1]
But you, Eivor. If you ever get tired of the settled life … we could always use a thief with your skills. Think about it.

Id: [0x002DEAE2]
In you, I see the fighter I once was, yet your aims are noble. Honest. I cannot look away.

Id: [0x002DEAE3]
Ah … then all I can say is, I hope you are happy and well-loved.

Id: [0x002DEAE4]
Ah! Eivor. How's the day, my friend?

Id: [0x002DEAE5]
You came here to ask me about no one?

Id: [0x002DEAE6]
Very well. Meet me outside when you're ready. I believe I know where they will be.

Id: [0x002DEAE7]
That must have been … punishing. But you are so strong, so determined.

Id: [0x002DEAE8]
I see. Are you sure you wouldn't want to keep trying? Push through the doubt?

Id: [0x002DEAE9]
Remember, you can only shoot a target once! Ready? Go!

Id: [0x002DEAEA]
That was fun. Next time, could we light the arrows afire? Or shoot blindfolded?

Id: [0x002DEAEB]
Careful, I might have let you win.

Id: [0x002DEAEC]
Very impressive. I hope you're ready for how you'll feel in the morning.

Id: [0x002DEAED]
Is that so? Well, I … I hope you've thought this through. Are you sure?

Id: [0x002DEAEE]
Well done! Not many have beaten me. But I think in a rematch, I'll trounce you.

Id: [0x002DEAEF]
A coward to the last. Have courage, Eivor. I will make it quick.

Id: [0x002DEAF0]
What do you know of honor that Sigurd did not teach you? You suckle at his teat and then leave him to die.

Id: [0x002DEAF1]
Coward!

Id: [0x002DEAF2]
It was never in his character to lead. It was always within yours.

Id: [0x002DEAF3]
That is … quite direct. If you are sure, then you should know … it must be final. I will not have my heart broken again.

Id: [0x002DEAF4]
You've been away for so long!

Id: [0x002DEAF5]
Eivor King-Maker we shall call you soon.

Id: [0x002DEAF6]
You do this work well, Eivor. Is it a prelude to you joining the Hidden Ones?

Id: [0x002DEAF7]
Be careful. Herefrith may be more than he seems.

Id: [0x002DEAF8]
Very generous of you. Make for the town of Glowecestre. You will find him there.

Id: [0x002DEAF9]
According to my scouts, he is a man who cares more for his own indulgences than the safety of his people. Approach with care.

Id: [0x002DEAFA]
If you are keen to meet him, he asks that you join him at his war camp. I have the location here.

Id: [0x002DEAFB]
If that is true, you are in luck. Our old friends Hjorr and Ljufvina have made their homes in Jorvik.

Id: [0x002DEAFC]
If you go, do not go boldly.

Id: [0x002DEAFD]
A passage from their holy book, I believe. Interesting. Go with care.

Id: [0x002DEAFE]
It is a long voyage, Eivor. Be careful.

Id: [0x002DEAFF]
We will be ready when you are.

Id: [0x002DEB00]
My guild, The Thousand Eyes, offers contracts that pay in opal. If you're interested, I always have one or two open.

Id: [0x002DEB01]
Excellent work, my friend! You impress me more and more every day. Here is what you have earned.

Id: [0x002DEB02]
My bowls and cutlery. At last, they came. Thank you stranger.

Id: [0x002DEB03]
Did you carry that all the way from central Mercia? God blind me, it's a wonder you weren't eaten by wolves on the way here.

Id: [0x002DEB04]
This is perfect, Eivor! You really are a generous one.

Id: [0x002DEB05]
You and Petra, eh? Couldn't ask for a better match for my sister. You treat her well.

Id: [0x002DEB06]
Eivor, have you ever been in love?

Id: [0x002DEB07]
And you, Eivor. Now that you have seen our enemy and you understand our cause, I wonder if you would join us? Become a Hidden One.

Id: [0x002DEB08]
Speak with him if you are curious to see it.

Id: [0x002DEB09]
You mean … you mean you slew him yourself.

Id: [0x002DEB0A]
Brilliant as ever, my friend. Thank you. For all you have done.

Id: [0x002DEB0B]
Ready to set sail?

Id: [0x002DEB0C]
You must be dressed as a thrall when you arrive. To be seen as you are would raise suspicions.

Id: [0x002DEB0D]
Good. Let me know when you're ready and we'll get going.

Id: [0x002DEB0E]
Please, Eivor. Be quick.

Id: [0x002DEB0F]
Go then. With great care. But know that the home you leave will not be the home to which you return.

Id: [0x002DEB10]
Eivor … you come alone. I fear what that means for Sigurd.

Id: [0x002DEB11]
Look! There's a filthy Dane now! Why don't we ask!

Id: [0x002DEB12]
Aye, to look upon Devil's work. But why would a Dane from upriver care what happens to Saxon farmers?

Id: [0x002DEB13]
I saw it, warrior, I did! The night it happened, I saw it all.

Id: [0x002DEB14]
Eivor, you live yet! Pray, tell all.

Id: [0x002DEB15]
That's not the berserker!

Id: [0x002DEB16]
You have a strong war-arm, Raven-shirt.

Id: [0x002DEB17]
But you live still! Can you feel the power of bear's blood coursing through your veins?

Id: [0x002DEB1A]
Well, that'd be why you en't found him. But you're free to pass the time just here if you like.

Id: [0x002DEB1B]
You look well, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEB1C]
You are Norse, are you not?

Id: [0x002DEB1D]
Yes, that is why I called you here. [beat]Do you balk at the opportunity to bury the Saxon king?

Id: [0x002DEB1E]
Your bravery, your leadership, Eivor … you wear it well. You have grown much since last we spoke.

Id: [0x002DEB20]
Eivor! You made it unscathed.

Id: [0x002DEB21]
Good, come find us again when you are ready.

Id: [0x002DEB22]
Did you think my king would turn his back on you, Eivor? When your knife is smeared with the blood of Werham?

Id: [0x002DEB23]
For all your boasts, warrior, I scratch at you like a cat.

Id: [0x002DEB24]
Kill me then. It makes no odds. For here you stand. Bloody and breathless, no closer to my king, no closer to his throne.

Id: [0x002DEB25]
I am glad to have known you, Eivor. My truest…

Id: [0x002DEB26]
Are you ready to honor them?

Id: [0x002DEB2F]
I have heard the name! You helped the Sons of Ragnar overthrow the Mercian King! Well met.

Id: [0x002DEB31]
Bah! Eivor now tastes the slaver's whip, and with Prince Sigurd likely lost at sea, the Ravens will soon be a memory.

Id: [0x002DEB32]
Bah! Eivor now tastes the slaver's whip, and with Prince Sigurd likely lost at sea, the Ravens will soon be a memory.

Id: [0x002DEB34]
Large walker! Join us, large walker!

Id: [0x002DEB35]
O, goodness! You're not … not one of them. You must help me slip free!

Id: [0x002DEB37]
But seeing you as a leader in your own right … inspires me to do the same. Farewell, old friend.

Id: [0x002DEB38]
You can count on it, my friend.

Id: [0x002DEB3D]
Thanks for wrecking the voyage. Now I've got no work. What a hero.

Id: [0x002DEB3E]
O, the skalds will sing of this day! How Eivor traveled far and wide, hunting Gorm along the world's rim!

Id: [0x002DEB3F]
And you … Eivor. Where will you go? Across the sea with us? Or back into the woods?

Id: [0x002DEB40]
I can linger a few days in port. Speak to me when you're ready to sail.

Id: [0x002DEB4E]
Eivor, Trygve has no intention to lead. He feels duty bound to follow his master into death.

Id: [0x002DEB5A]
How kind of you, Eivor. I will be sure to stir your soup with one, after I have had a sound scratching.

Id: [0x002DEB5B]
And I am looking for a new adventure. If I remember right, you said I might find it here, with your clan.

Id: [0x002DEB5C]
Eivor! We need your help!

Id: [0x002DEB5D]
Come on, Eivor! Can't you run any quicker?

Id: [0x002DEB5E]
You did it! You brought Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEB5F]
Sorry, Eivor. We had to trick you. But it wasn't my idea, it was Eira's!

Id: [0x002DEB60]
Eivor, if you won't help us free her, we must do it ourselves.

Id: [0x002DEB61]
Yes! You freed her! You're amazing, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEB62]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEB63]
We only wanted to have an adventure like you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEB64]
What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEB65]
She'd be rotting away by now! Just like that boar you killed, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEB66]
You there! Get to cover! Eivor, with me. Let's end this.

Id: [0x002DEB67]
Eivor, hold … I hear something.

Id: [0x002DEB68]
Eivor. Have you seen Wallace?

Id: [0x002DEB69]
Eivor. If you've a moment to spare…

Id: [0x002DEB6A]
I'd like to search the woods for him, but alone I fear I'd have little luck. Would you join me? Two could cover much more ground.

Id: [0x002DEB6B]
What were we saying?

Id: [0x002DEB6C]
O, no. Eivor, over here.

Id: [0x002DEB6D]
O my God, Eivor! Eivor! Come this way!

Id: [0x002DEB6E]
Eivor! Here! What are you waiting for?

Id: [0x002DEB6F]
I saw it, Eivor. I saw him nearby.

Id: [0x002DEB70]
Here! Here, Eivor, inside!

Id: [0x002DEB71]
Eivor! I'm here!

Id: [0x002DEB72]
Eivor. Nice to see you here.

Id: [0x002DEB73]
Eivor. I am right here. There is no need to question this carrion further.

Id: [0x002DEB74]
Eivor, come on! I'm up here!

Id: [0x002DEB75]
You did it, just like your Synin! And not a scratch on you. Now let's go! Wallace should be over there.

Id: [0x002DEB76]
Eivor! Look! The elk has returned!

Id: [0x002DEB77]
Come on, Eivor! Chase the elk!

Id: [0x002DEB78]
Wait … we … we're home. [discouraged]Full circle with nothing to show for it.

Id: [0x002DEB79]
Well, I really enjoyed the time we've spent together, Eivor. More than enjoyed.

Id: [0x002DEB7A]
What I'm trying to say here is that I … I like you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEB7B]
And I'd like to go further with you. I thought we might, you know … be together.

Id: [0x002DEB7D]
Eivor…?

Id: [0x002DEB7E]
Eivor, there. What is that?

Id: [0x002DEB7F]
Please, Eivor. Not the longship.

Id: [0x002DEB80]
Well, well, well! Is that Eivor I see?

Id: [0x002DEB81]
Eivor, come. We have a camp to raid.

Id: [0x002DEB82]
…unless you have a more interesting day planned for us.

Id: [0x002DEB83]
O certainly not, Eivor Wolf-Kissed, iron-fisted drengr. I would never tease one with such commanding authority.

Id: [0x002DEB84]
Did you? Well done! And did you find my sweet mare?

Id: [0x002DEB85]
Thank the gods she is safe. And thank you, Eivor … and your friend Randvi, wherever she is.

Id: [0x002DEB86]
A good sup, Eivor, but Randvi's done you better.

Id: [0x002DEB87]
I know it might not show, Eivor, but I am terribly excited.

Id: [0x002DEB88]
I think so too. It may be we would have sailed together, over the open seas. Raiding or … traveling.

Id: [0x002DEB89]
I am sober enough. But the truth of it is … I have felt this way for some time now. I care for you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEB8A]
Today has meant so much. We rode, we fought, we drank, we laughed. You showed me your world. Not in words but deeds.

Id: [0x002DEB8B]
Let this be a dream, then. A moment that never happened but in our minds. I would not wish you to see me so weak as that.

Id: [0x002DEB8D]
Eivor, that is … kind of you. I hope one day I can repay you.

Id: [0x002DEB8E]
Eivor. Shall we go?

Id: [0x002DEB8F]
You too, Eivor. Thank you for your help.

Id: [0x002DEB90]
You are living the life you want, aren't you?

Id: [0x002DEB91]
God go with you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEB92]
You found it!

Id: [0x002DEB93]
I'm here, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEB94]
Yes, I cannot thank you enough, Eivor. I feared the worst when I heard my old moniker, Guthban. Hadn't heard it in years. Dredges up fearful memories.

Id: [0x002DEB95]
You caught my attention, you know. The moment I first saw you, I knew there was something special about you.

Id: [0x002DEB96]
I care for you, Eivor. Since we burned my name in the ledger that day, my thoughts have drifted back to you daily.

Id: [0x002DEB98]
Have you given any more thought to … what we spoke about?

Id: [0x002DEB99]
O? What for, love?

Id: [0x002DEB9A]
Eivor! A moment?

Id: [0x002DEB9B]
Gods, Eivor. I was robbed! On the road between here and Lincoln.

Id: [0x002DEB9C]
I do not begrudge us taking in orphans, Eivor. But some of these Saxons, we hardly know them. You ought to ask around.

Id: [0x002DEB9D]
Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEB9E]
I am Octavian, I have always been Octavian. Now please, Eivor, this is not a good time for me. I am terribly busy. Good day.

Id: [0x002DEB9F]
I am Guthban, Eivor. It means Battle-Bone. Not the name of a cheery baker, is it?

Id: [0x002DEBA0]
These men are foul, Eivor. You should not have to fight my battles for me.

Id: [0x002DEBA1]
Eivor, it's Svend, he … he passed, while I was away.

Id: [0x002DEBA2]
Thank you, Eivor. I need to get home

Id: [0x002DEBA3]
Eivor. Before you say more, I must tell you something. [pause]Randvi and I have … have ended our marriage.

Id: [0x002DEBA4]
Eivor. How are you?

Id: [0x002DEBA5]
Eivor, darling, how nice to see you.

Id: [0x002DEBA7]
If this was a deer, we would be feasting well tonight.

Id: [0x002DEBA8]
How does it feel to be so humbled?

Id: [0x002DEBA9]
Such a joy to see you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEBAA]
Eivor, I was eager to see you.

Id: [0x002DEBAB]
Curses! You're a lucky one, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEBAC]
That is not so, you thickheaded-- Eivor, care to judge a flyting?

Id: [0x002DEBAD]
There! What do you think, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEBAE]
I should have expected no less from you, Eivor. You have no ear for these things. A pity.

Id: [0x002DEBAF]
Thank you, Eivor. For acknowledging the natural order.

Id: [0x002DEBB0]
I do not know what you are thinking, Eivor. But do enjoy the monster you have created.

Id: [0x002DEBB1]
What's the matter, Eivor? Are you scared?

Id: [0x002DEBB2]
You should have listened! You might have saved yourself!

Id: [0x002DEBB3]
Eivor. A moment of your time?

Id: [0x002DEBB4]
You would not have listened.

Id: [0x002DEBB5]
I do hope you see it now, in all that you have done for us.

Id: [0x002DEBB8]
But it was you, Eivor. Only you. Everything you are, everything you will become.

Id: [0x002DEBB9]
Eivor, I want you to know that Sigurd and I are…

Id: [0x002DEBBA]
I did ask, didn't I? You're right. Lead the way, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEBBB]
That sounds lovely. And too far to consider just now. But thank you, Eivor. Maybe another time.

Id: [0x002DEBBC]
Please, Eivor. Not now. Not with Sigurd there.

Id: [0x002DEBBE]
I understand, Eivor. We all know these peaks and valleys, from time to time.

Id: [0x002DEBBF]
Of course I was. Such a long voyage. Did you do what had to be done?

Id: [0x002DEBC0]
O, hello, Eivor. Good day.

Id: [0x002DEBC1]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEBC2]
I had a wonderful time, Eivor. Thank you for your company. And your friendship.

Id: [0x002DEBC3]
Well done, Eivor. These early victories will pay off well.

Id: [0x002DEBC4]
Yes, my scouts told me. Such a tragic death for so dubious a gain. I hope you paid his killers back in kind.

Id: [0x002DEBC5]
Sad news, but you made the best of it.

Id: [0x002DEBC6]
Rest, then. You have earned it.

Id: [0x002DEBC7]
Understood. Thank you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEBC8]
Glad to have her. Good work.

Id: [0x002DEBC9]
Have you spoke with Hytham about Vinland?

Id: [0x002DEBCA]
Good. I have marked it on the map, with a bit of guess work as to its location. Let me know when you wish to leave.

Id: [0x002DEBCB]
I think you should.

Id: [0x002DEBCC]
Indeed. But I think it best if you supervise these talks. If Ceolbert can make this work, we will gain a valuable alliance.

Id: [0x002DEBCD]
Ah, yes … Sigurd is there now, in fact. He bids you go meet him as soon as you can.

Id: [0x002DEBCE]
Good. Be safe, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEBCF]
Indeed. And now Aelfgar asks that you return and right the wrong you brought to life. He is waiting near Anecastre with his fyrd (peasant army).

Id: [0x002DEBD0]
I have received a unique summons from Snotinghamscire in the north. From your old friend, Vili.

Id: [0x002DEBD1]
Good. I will send word to our allies at once. Meet with Basim when you can. He should be in Croindene by now.

Id: [0x002DEBD2]
You may have noticed that Gunnar has disappeared from his forge. He has traveled to Glowecestrescire in search of a wife.

Id: [0x002DEBD3]
When doesn't this happen with our dear, lovelorn blacksmith? But there is a bright side. He has asked you to join him.

Id: [0x002DEBD4]
Halfdan Ragnarsson, Conqueror of the North, sends his greeting. He wishes to meet with Eivor Wolf-Kissed personally.

Id: [0x002DEBD5]
With caution, Eivor. Eurvicscire is currently at war with the Picts, a proud clan that lives just beyond the Roman wall.

Id: [0x002DEBD6]
Rumor or not, I found someone willing to sail you there. She claims to have seen it once before.

Id: [0x002DEBD7]
Nessa is her name. Meet her at the docks when you are ready to leave.

Id: [0x002DEBD8]
Good. And be safe. Both of you.

Id: [0x002DEBD9]
Eivor. A word of note… Someone has set up shop outside. A trader, I believe.

Id: [0x002DEBDA]
No, that cannot be right. Ask him yourself.

Id: [0x002DEBDB]
Eivor, I don't know if you heard the news, but dear Svend has died.

Id: [0x002DEBDC]
One more thing … I do not know if you heard, but Svend passed away a short time ago. The poor man slipped away in his bed.

Id: [0x002DEBDD]
I want to thank you for your judgment, Eivor. For stepping in when Sigurd would not. In spite of what happened.

Id: [0x002DEBDE]
Let's not walk too far with that idea. I need you right where you are.

Id: [0x002DEBDF]
How do you feel, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEBE0]
Eivor! Good to see you, I-- erm. Did you want something or… I was wondering…

Id: [0x002DEBE1]
Brigid and I were thinking, with everything calming down the way it has … maybe you could find a spare moment and…

Id: [0x002DEBE2]
I'll be honest, Eivor. I came here with the lot of you because nothing and no one kept me back there. The Raven Clan is all the family I need.

Id: [0x002DEBE3]
Even when Dag was younger, he had a streak in him. Hate to see it go that way, but you did the right thing.

Id: [0x002DEBE4]
Between you and me, Eivor? Always thought you'd be a good jarl.

Id: [0x002DEBE5]
Eivor. Good to see you.

Id: [0x002DEBE6]
Do my eyes deceive me, or did you deliver all of my remaining orders?

Id: [0x002DEBE7]
This is fine work, really. Thank you for seeing this done.

Id: [0x002DEBE8]
You and Petra, chasing a white elk in the woods, high as wispy clouds, my God! I could barely breathe for laughing!

Id: [0x002DEBE9]
Shame about you and Petra. Liked you two together. But some things aren't meant to be. Glad there aren't hard feelings.

Id: [0x002DEBEA]
O, thank you, Eivor! Thank you!

Id: [0x002DEBEB]
Hello, Eivor! Wanted to give you this fishing rope. How do you like it?

Id: [0x002DEBEC]
I think it's so you can catch fish for him while you're traveling. He'd love to see how you do.

Id: [0x002DEBED]
Thanks for the good work, Eivor! Got a real little fishery going here.

Id: [0x002DEBEE]
If I taught you our creed, if you spent time with it … it could open your mind to another view.

Id: [0x002DEBEF]
I understand you well, Eivor. Very well indeed.

Id: [0x002DEBF0]
Eivor, again your people impress me with your skill. The invaders barely stood a chance.

Id: [0x002DEBF1]
Eivor. Did Basim contact you in Norway? He said he would be joining you. Yet here you are, and I have had no word from him.

Id: [0x002DEBF2]
Thank you for opening your home to us, Eivor. We could not be happier.

Id: [0x002DEBF3]
And you, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEBF4]
Eivor. Before you go…

Id: [0x002DEBF5]
First things first, Eivor. My ship, my rules. Second, you follow the rules. Third, if you listen to my rules, you live.

Id: [0x002DEBF6]
Eivor … Sigurd wishes to speak with you. He is quite agitated.

Id: [0x002DEBF7]
You will want to speak to him yourself.

Id: [0x002DEBF8]
Have you spoken with Randvi? Are we ready to leave?

Id: [0x002DEBF9]
Eivor. The time has come. Our time.

Id: [0x002DEBFA]
I do not speak of death, Eivor. I speak of life! Life and glory everlasting!

Id: [0x002DEBFB]
Shall we, then, Eivor? To Norway … and well beyond.

Id: [0x002DEBFC]
Eivor, what has happened?

Id: [0x002DEBFD]
Eivor, you must not go. You must not! The signs, the portents, they shout and wail! Your leaving will be our doom!

Id: [0x002DEBFE]
Eivor! You have returned. But … has Hunwald not come with you?

Id: [0x002DEBFF]
No… Gods, no, don't say it. Please, Eivor, don't say it.

Id: [0x002DEC00]
O gods, I know he would have fainted to hear such praise from your lips. Thank you, Eivor. Thank you.

Id: [0x002DEC01]
Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEC02]
Well done, Eivor. After so long, it finally occurs to you to search for our jarl. I applaud your halfhearted effort.

Id: [0x002DEC03]
Say whatever makes you feel superior, Eivor. I know Sigurd will understand my decision.

Id: [0x002DEC04]
A fine way of putting it, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002DEC05]
Before what, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEC06]
Exactly. You should begin in Lunden. I have credible reports that The Order is working now to seize the city.

Id: [0x002DEC07]
You slaughtered my best milk-cow, you beast!

Id: [0x002DEC08]
Well and good, Eivor of the Raven Clan. Take a look at the maulings and tell me what manner of rabid beast did these things.

Id: [0x002DEC09]
No, I am unhurt. Thank you, Dane. I … misjudged you.

Id: [0x002DEC0A]
Something's off, Eivor. Hrothgar's men are rowdy sorts, but the air is far too still.

Id: [0x002DEC0B]
The villagers say it is the Devil's Mark. What do you say, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEC0C]
Eivor, look up. More blood.

Id: [0x002DEC0D]
Hrothgar sometimes slept in the loft. Have you looked up there?

Id: [0x002DEC0E]
Best hide to not scare the demon off when it returns.

Id: [0x002DEC0F]
God saves us all, Eivor. [beat]I take my leave now, but will write you once my poem is complete. Farewell.

Id: [0x002DEC10]
Who cares? Kill them both! Filthy bear and dirty Danes, all must die!

Id: [0x002DEC11]
Fame has two faces, Eivor of the Ravens. In Norway, many a young thane wanted the glory of killing me. [beat]They died.

Id: [0x002DEC12]
Before, you asked if I would join your clan. [beat]I am ready.

Id: [0x002DEC13]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC14]
The wars have not ended. You have simply stopped fighting. But men are brewing plots in meadhalls and bedrooms. You will see.

Id: [0x002DEC15]
I owe you my thanks, Eivor. For that, I give you this, the key to my study. That you may better understand the good you have done.

Id: [0x002DEC16]
With The Order all but destroyed, you have made room for a greater idea, one to take its place.

Id: [0x002DEC17]
You have saved England, whether or not that was your intent. Now, let England save you.

Id: [0x002DEC18]
I do not know if we shall meet again, Eivor. God willing, we will … as one lord to another, perhaps.

Id: [0x002DEC19]
Eivor. You came at Guthrum's call. It is good to see you.

Id: [0x002DEC1A]
Guthrum is not a babe-at-teat, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC1B]
Speak again, handmaid, and I will feed your tongue to Eivor's raven.

Id: [0x002DEC1C]
We await your signal, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC1D]
Eivor, we stand ready for your signal.

Id: [0x002DEC1E]
You almost sound like you respect him, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC1F]
Thank you, Eivor. You did a great deed here. Their families will raise a cup to you.

Id: [0x002DEC20]
We owe Eivor a lot, my love.

Id: [0x002DEC21]
I have, but this does not sit well with me, Eivor. This is a Christian feast, and the people here are not soldiers.

Id: [0x002DEC22]
Ah, Eivor. Who would not be joyous, reaving at your side?

Id: [0x002DEC23]
Have you ever met a woman less in need of a guardian than me, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEC24]
My sword is yours when you are ready, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC25]
Eivor! It is good to see you.

Id: [0x002DEC26]
I could not let you down, Eivor. That's not what an honorable man does. So here I am, despite my reservations.

Id: [0x002DEC27]
I have seen to my brother, sent him to Valhalla with grave-goods. I am done with sorrow, Eivor. Now I am bloody angry.

Id: [0x002DEC28]
Look, you Saxon bed-wetters! Here is a real warrior.

Id: [0x002DEC29]
Eivor, you know I will take your childhood scrapes and secrets to the pyre.

Id: [0x002DEC2A]
I will do my mother and my Lord proud today, Eivor. The Lord knows I have not been the best of sons.

Id: [0x002DEC2B]
Is this what it feels to be a warrior, Eivor? Snakes writhing in your stomach's pit?

Id: [0x002DEC2C]
I was always him, but my faith was like a veil. I am glad you helped me lift it.

Id: [0x002DEC2D]
And you taught me a lot, Eivor. Our time together was … well, it taught me much.

Id: [0x002DEC2E]
I never thought it possible, Eivor. That you would rally Saxons and Norse under your black-feathered banner.

Id: [0x002DEC2F]
So, what is the plan, Eivor?

Id: [0x002DEC30]
We await your instructions, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC31]
Gladly, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC32]
I follow you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC33]
This island will never be your home, Eivor. You will not subdue her with vicious force, or win her with cocksure words.

Id: [0x002DEC34]
Go, Eivor. They will not better us.

Id: [0x002DEC35]
Eivor … have you seen graver wounds?

Id: [0x002DEC36]
Please, Eivor. We must get him to the farmhouse.

Id: [0x002DEC37]
Perhaps not, Eivor. It may be I will sit beside my father soon. Will he be proud of me?

Id: [0x002DEC38]
I will not leave his side, Eivor. I owe him that at least.

Id: [0x002DEC39]
For Eivor and the Raven Clan!

Id: [0x002DEC3B]
Hush. What good can words do, Eivor? Keep to silence. He is gone.

Id: [0x002DEC3C]
I saw him, Eivor. In my darkest moment, Brothir stood beside me, and all was as it used to be.

Id: [0x002DEC3D]
Aye. And there you'll find me, Eivor. In amongst the blood and death, Brothir at my shoulder. Until the Valkyries claim me.

Id: [0x002DEC3E]
I have wasted so much time in pouting like a child. No more, Eivor, no more.

Id: [0x002DEC3F]
Enjoy this victory, Eivor, whatever it brings you. Only a coward thinks he'll live forever.

Id: [0x002DEC40]
Would it not soothe you to know there is something beyond all this? Not war and valor, but quiet and peace?

Id: [0x002DEC41]
Whatever, I must do. England is my final home, Eivor. And I will do what it takes to remain.

Id: [0x002DEC46]
Good work, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC47]
Save your energy, Eivor. There may be more yet!

Id: [0x002DEC52]
Eivor! This way!

Id: [0x002DEC53]
Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC54]
Many thanks, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC55]
[pain]Bless you, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC56]
Did you hear that scream? Sounded like Hunwald. He went out that side door.

Id: [0x002DEC57]
Ah! Eivor! Help me up.

Id: [0x002DEC58]
Thrust me back into the fight, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC59]
They've bludgeoned me, Eivor. Help!

Id: [0x002DEC5A]
Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC5B]
Eivor, could you spare a moment?

Id: [0x002DEC5C]
That is good to hear, Eivor. Very good to hear.

Id: [0x002DEC5D]
Eivor! Help me destroy these barricades. Our men are on the other side!

Id: [0x002DEC5E]
I will join the brothers, Eivor. Meet us at Tonna's.

Id: [0x002DEC60]
I hope you understand, Eivor. Now leave me.

Id: [0x002DEC61]
With my friends here, we scoured the calculations to locate Eivor's probable resting place. Then I contacted you.

Id: [0x002DEC62]
It will not happen while Raven Clan lives. They fight like berserkers. Eivor Wolf-Kissed killed a score or more single-handed.

Id: [0x002DEC63]
Eivor! Join me for a drink.

Id: [0x002DEC64]
Stay on the road safe, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC65]
Eivor! Good to see you.

Id: [0x002DEC66]
The seal you took from The Needle's hand. You don't think someone could have stolen…?

Id: [0x002DEC67]
I have the Yuletide feast to prepare for as well. Do drop by for the festivities, Eivor. Have a drink or two.

Id: [0x002DEC68]
Look around! Search every room! They're around here somewhere!

Id: [0x002DEC69]
Head on to the cavern, Eivor. Isbjorn awaits me elsewhere.

Id: [0x002DEC6A]
His rage has consumed him, Eivor. All this anger, this sadness, it has truly taken form.

Id: [0x002DEC6B]
Thank Odin, he has the mighty Wolf-Kissed as his shadow.

Id: [0x002DEC6C]
Thank you for all you have done, Eivor. In my mind, this version of my life, one as a jarl, was clouded with fear of disappointment. Of shackles.

Id: [0x002DEC6D]
Here, Eivor. This was where Vili saw the scout killed and then charged after the enemy ahead.

Id: [0x002DEC6E]
Thank you, Eivor. I entrust Vili to you.

Id: [0x002DEC6F]
Eivor, we meet again.

Id: [0x002DEC70]
Another falls before you, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC71]
A good strike, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC72]
They have the keep sealed tight down here, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DEC73]
Good work, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC74]
The ram can't pass through the flames, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC75]
We are through, Eivor!

Id: [0x002DEC76]
What … what is this? You're not one of them.

Id: [0x002DEC77]
There you are, Eivor! Over here!

Id: [0x002DEC78]
Walk with me, Eivor. I would welcome some company now.

Id: [0x002DEC79]
An oath is an oath, Eivor. Silver-gilded and ironclad.

Id: [0x002DEC7F]
I lived, I died, and now I sleep. And in my sleep I dream. And in my dreams I see an end to the doom that will grip the earth once again. Find the Wolf-Kissed, find the Mad One, find me, and save us all from another death.

Id: [0x002DEC80]
To bolster our trade, of course. Wallace is the finest tanner and taxidermist in all of England.

Id: [0x002DEC81]
I cannot thank you enough. Both of you.

Id: [0x002DEC82]
No, I mean … did something happen between you two?

Id: [0x002DEC83]
I understand. Things can be difficult but … but we can face them together.

Id: [0x002DEC84]
And I believe he is happy for us.

Id: [0x002DEC85]
There you are, Raven!

Id: [0x002DEC89]
We found your camp, Dane! Your friends are all trussed up. No one to help you now!

Id: [0x002DEC8E]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed!

Id: [0x002DEC8F]
Jora of Jorvik! You shirked your work for quite some time!

Id: [0x002DEC90]
That is an image I will fix in my mind, Wolf-Kissed. Happy to be aboard.

Id: [0x002DEC91]
Shhh, she's coming!

Id: [0x002DEC92]
You were visited!

Id: [0x002DEC93]
It's been quite a while since I've seen your face around here!

Id: [0x002DEC94]
A drinking contest. You versus me. Wolf-Kissed versus Table-Maiden.

Id: [0x002DEC95]
Ha! Petra wins! Sorry, Wolf-Kissed.

Id: [0x002DEC96]
I know you're often away, but I don't mind. Honestly. Every moment counts. Even if it's sitting quietly with the fish.

Id: [0x002DEC97]
And from the day we set out from Norway, I knew that you would make a fitter leader than Sigurd.

Id: [0x002DEC98]
He is more observant than I often give him credit for. I believe he sees us as we are. And as we hope to be.

Id: [0x002DEC99]
But do not think for a moment that I have forgotten you and our wonderful day.

Id: [0x002DEC9A]
As a West Saxon stronghold, Wincestre will be a rather unwelcome place for you. But that is nothing you cannot handle.

Id: [0x002DEC9B]
Your Poor Fellow-Soldier led you to the King of Wessex? How very strange. He … or she … is toying with you, it seems.

Id: [0x002DEC9C]
And you. Come to make your name in battle? Another corpse at my door won't matter.

Id: [0x002DEC9D]
You turn my words against me now, Wolf-Kissed?

Id: [0x002DEC9E]
I am all aquiver with anticipation.

Id: [0x002DECA0]
I see you!

Id: [0x002DECA1]
Eivor Wolf-Kissed tempts me with a swipe at Wessex … who am I to resist?

Id: [0x002DECA2]
You made it up! You truly are a brave one!

Id: [0x002DECA3]
Are you sure? Well, okay then…

Id: [0x002DECA9]
Ah! I should take cover.

Id: [0x002DECAA]
Ah! I should take cover.

Id: [0x002DECAB]
Suttungr's ice ... it looks unstable.

Id: [0x002DECAC]
Suttungr's ice ... it looks unstable.

Id: [0x002DECAD]
Need to get out of this.

Id: [0x002DECAE]
Need to get out of this.

Id: [0x002DECAF]
That ice looks fragile.

Id: [0x002DECB0]
That ice looks fragile.

Id: [0x002DECB5]
His head is exposed. How do I reach it?

Id: [0x002DECB6]
His head is exposed. How do I reach it?

Id: [0x002DECB7]
I could get a better shot at his head from above.

Id: [0x002DECB8]
I could get a better shot at his head from above.

Id: [0x002DECB9]
Dammit. Missed!

Id: [0x002DECBA]
Dammit. Missed!

Id: [0x002DECBB]
Almost...

Id: [0x002DECBC]
Almost...

Id: [0x002DECCB]
Your meddling has doomed us all, crow of battle.

Id: [0x002DECCD]
Or we could have a drink. To celebrate our victory.

Id: [0x002DECCE]
Hm, strange. I see your lips moving so rapidly, yet all I hear is "Thank you, Randvi."

Id: [0x002DECD1]
Yes. [beat]But now I fear I must ask you one last thing, should you be willing.

Id: [0x002DEE39]
Hold on. I'll just set this here. Do you guys record everything we talk about? Not everything. But you've been using the Animus so much, I thought this was a good chance to learn some things about prolonged exposure. So, I'm your guinea pig. No, no, my guinea pigs are all dead. The Animus was too much for them to handle. Cute. Can I ask you about the bleeding effect? Any recent flashes? Any memories resurfacing? Yeah, the usual things. Ghost-images of Altair and Ezio a few times a day. Nothing intrusive, just brief moments. They pass quickly, almost without me noticing. Like a figure in the corner of my eye. Or remembering a dream from the night before. I did have one extended hallucination a few days ago. It was Ezio. He was older, around the time he left Cappadocia. He was standing on the deck of a ship. Alone. And through him, I could feel an intense … regret. Or guilt. And it felt to me like he'd had a … a loss of faith. In himself, in the Creed. Like he couldn't keep it up. Couldn't stay true to his ideals. And as I watched him, I thought, "Is this the moment he decided he was done being an assassin?" It felt like it. Anyway, most of my visions have been brief. Lasting just a few seconds. They're like … complete memories of small moments that appear suddenly out of nowhere, fully formed. It's a strange feeling. Okay. Anything else? I'm starting to see Connor now too. Though I hear his voice more often than I see him. I'm sure that will change. Oh yeah, and yesterday … just before bed, I had a memory of being on a beach in the Caribbean. With a bunch of sailors. Or maybe they were pirates? I don't know. No idea. Huh. We'll look into that. And how do you feel, in general? In general? Well … I feel older, for one. Much older. And it's strangely comforting. I'm collecting the memories and skills and thoughts of so many people, I feel like I've lived a few hundred years or more. Is it possible that if I do this for too long, it'll push my own memories aside? That I'll be everyone but myself after a while? It's possible. That's called identity substitution. It's happened before, but it's rare. And someone with your background shouldn't need to worry. My background … you mean someone with my genes? My … abilities? You have Isu DNA. And that lets you see things and do things and … withstand traumas that other people can't. And I can suffer in ways that others can't. That's not something to be proud of. You mean, the Apple? Yeah. It has a pull, Becs. It tugs at my brain. It talks to me. Teases me. Drives me mad. And what I did to Lucy … God dammit. Nothing is worth the damage I did. The pain I caused. I know. But you're special, that's the point. I'm not special, Becs. I'm lucky. That's all. I understand. We're Assassins. It's our creed that makes us different, not our genes. Not our blood. Anyone can join us. That's true. But let's leave that aside for a second. What I want to know is, have you ever had any Isu memories resurface? Isu memories? I don't … don't think so. I can't even begin to imagine what that would feel like. I think you'd know if you did. Maybe one day. We might be able to induce something. Jesus, let's fix the world first, okay? Before we start digging up my ancient ancestors. Deal. With my luck, I'll be related to some third rate Isu like … like Sisyphus or something. [laugh]Way to aim high, buddy. [laugh]Hey, you gotta.

Id: [0x002DEE3A]
Layla, thought you might be interested in this. Conversations that Becs and I had with Desmond, back in twenty-twelve. Humm… December, I think. Just candid talks, that's all. We didn't square any circles or write any big poetry. But he did have some interesting insights into his time in the Animus and what it means to be an Assassin. Anyway, have a listen. You might find you and he had similar experiences. So, huh, well, let me know what you think. Unless it's to tell me I sound like a total prat in these recordings. If that's the case, just … say nothing. I mean, I did have a slight cold at the time I recorded these. That's probably why I sound odd. Anyway, I … I … Okay. I'm done anyway. So … turn … off. Turn off. Oh, it's actually just a button, sorry. Here we go.

Id: [0x002DEE3B]
You'll wonder where I am. You might wonder IF I am. I don't know how to answer that. But I'm not afraid. And I'm not alone. We have work to do. Work that may take us days or years. It's impossible to say. But we'll finish it. What I mean is … don't come looking for me. It's too dangerous and … and too late. Take care of yourselves. Take care of the world we still have. And take care of--

Hearken well, in hall of kings,<LF>On ocean-steed my words gain wings.

Id: [0x002DEE3D]
Odin's mead, I forth will bring,<LF>For noble deeds, thine honor sing.

Id: [0x002DEFD5]
Until our next moment alone, we should return to our great work. England will not pacify itself on our behalf.

Id: [0x002DEFD8]
Gorm … dead? B-by your hand?

Id: [0x002DEFDB]
Eivor, gods! You have come at just the right moment.

Id: [0x002DEFDD]
O, and before you go, could you spare a moment? For a small favor.

Id: [0x002DEFDE]
You and Soma … was there something more to your bond? You spoke of her with a particular shine in your eyes.

Id: [0x002DEFE0]
No, you've given me the answer I wanted. It's good you have found what calls you. A rare and happy thing.

Id: [0x002DEFE5]
And see that he does not make a fool of himself. I believe he thinks that your presence would bolster his image.

Id: [0x002DEFE6]
We received a summons from the ealdorman and his Lady of Colcestre, requesting you specifically, for "a matter of great secrecy."

Id: [0x002DEFE7]
An alliance in Essex would be invaluable. But go with caution.

Id: [0x002DEFE8]
What say you then?

Id: [0x002DEFE9]
I wonder if you have ever known the bitter agony of seeing your beloved in the arms of another?

Id: [0x002DEFEA]
His blood is on your hands, you monster!

Id: [0x002DEFEB]
You killed my child, my only child! My sweet, precious boy!

Id: [0x002DEFEC]
The demon bear! And its master!

Id: [0x002DEFEF]
Tell your shadowy friends that England is swept clean. Your work is done.

Id: [0x002DEFF0]
Beaten? No, not so. By my death, my lord may live.

Id: [0x002DEFF4]
I will head back to Hemthorpe and make sure our ravens stand vigilant. Return to us safely, drengr.

Id: [0x002DF00E]
Promise you will do it quick!

Id: [0x002DF00F]
Do not stab me from behind, drengr. Like Sigurd and the dragon. Please!

Id: [0x002DF010]
Yes, yes. They tell stories, yes. Come, listen!

Id: [0x002DF011]
The Web of Wyrd then. Nine lines that write our fates. Past, present, and future entwined.

Id: [0x002DF012]
You will betray Sigurd.

Id: [0x002DF013]
The Nornir have spoken… You will betray Sigurd.

Id: [0x002DF014]
You will betray Sigurd.

Id: [0x002DF015]
Good to be here, Sunbeam! The people here seem a mixed bag of nuts and seeds. I feel right at home.

Id: [0x002DF016]
Thank you, thank you! Follow me!

Id: [0x002DF017]
I can't! You won't understand, even if I do! Just trust me!

Id: [0x002DF018]
Your weapons show the marks of great battles. And you walk with a pride that speaks to your triumphs. Am I wrong?

Id: [0x002DF019]
Look. The wolves made a kill here. They're in the area.

Id: [0x002DF01A]
Ah! Look at that. The pattern on the grass. They slept here.

Id: [0x002DF01B]
You have seen nothing just yet.

Id: [0x002DF01C]
I'll wait here. Don't be long.

Id: [0x002DF01D]
Just come to me. I'll show you.

Id: [0x002DF01E]
What are you waiting for? Kiss me.

Id: [0x002DF01F]
Well. At least you know how I feel about you-- If anything…

Id: [0x002DF020]
No, say nothing. I understand. You know how I feel about you. And that is that.

Id: [0x002DF021]
Well met, Randvi. Eivor seems to have a preference for befriending lovely women.

Id: [0x002DF022]
A feeling you must know well, no? I have always wanted to experience the world as you do, and now I will…

Id: [0x002DF023]
Eivor! Over here! Look at this.

Id: [0x002DF024]
I am determined to get you drunk. Come on! Scared I will outpace you?

Id: [0x002DF025]
A shame, because we aren't leaving until you take me on.

Id: [0x002DF026]
Eivor is a beast! But you have my fealty, Randvi!

Id: [0x002DF027]
If you must.

Id: [0x002DF028]
Though I am newly separated from Sigurd, I should not have made such a frivolous advance. Forgive me.

Id: [0x002DF029]
Then do not say it. Show me. I am a quick study.

Id: [0x002DF02A]
No rush. Just let me know.

Id: [0x002DF02B]
I want you to know … should it come to blows with my old crew, I can handle it myself. Forgiving me is all the work you need to do.

Id: [0x002DF02C]
I know, I know. I'm busted up about it. But tell … Tekla, was it? Tell her that her ale is some of the finest we've tasted.

Id: [0x002DF02D]
You think Tekla will be upset with me when she learns why she was robbed?

Id: [0x002DF02E]
You see a problem and you solve it. For you know it is better to see it done than to let it fester.

Id: [0x002DF02F]
A calling can feel like a curse, but you wear yours well.

Id: [0x002DF030]
Y-you mean that?

Id: [0x002DF031]
Do you … do you mean that?

Id: [0x002DF032]
So you came to me? Why would you come to me about a false name? Do you think my name is false?

Id: [0x002DF033]
I understand. And I appreciate your honesty. Now, please, go. I'd like to be alone.

Id: [0x002DF034]
If you think you can win, love … I am eager to indulge you.

Id: [0x002DF035]
Ha! Bull's-eye. I dare you to do better.

Id: [0x002DF036]
Think of it this way … at least you're losing to someone who won't gloat. Not very much.

Id: [0x002DF037]
Drink some water, I think. Might go down easier.

Id: [0x002DF038]
I see. Then do what your heart bids. I will recover. And I hope we may remain friends.

Id: [0x002DF039]
Of course. I was about to go sink my line in the river. Care to join me?

Id: [0x002DF03A]
Spare me your pity and fight!

Id: [0x002DF03B]
How nice. Are you enjoying yourself?

Id: [0x002DF03C]
Gods, I worried you saw me as a woman starved for the affection of her husband. That it was loneliness driving me.

Id: [0x002DF03D]
Once you have gained an ally in a territory, return home and speak to me. We'll decide your next move then.

Id: [0x002DF03E]
His research could be useful in winning us alliances throughout the cities of England. Speak with him and see what he needs.

Id: [0x002DF03F]
And you do snore a little. Like a wounded bear.

Id: [0x002DF040]
Word of our growing settlement has reached outside ears. So have a look around … you may see a few new faces.

Id: [0x002DF041]
Will you go?

Id: [0x002DF042]
It is worth recalling that his father, Hemming Jarl, would be a formidable ally. Will you go?

Id: [0x002DF043]
In a city so chaotic, it is worth a try. Approach by the north gate, and start asking around.

Id: [0x002DF044]
I have heard ill news about Styrbjorn in the past year. If you go, go with care.

Id: [0x002DF045]
When you can, ask him his business here. He seems to represent a larger guild. The Child's Eyes. Or the Eyeless Children?

Id: [0x002DF046]
It has been rough on her. She spends quite a lot of time at his burial mound. Speak with her if you have the time.

Id: [0x002DF047]
Then I'd say you have fine taste. Have a look at what I've got.

Id: [0x002DF048]
Keep the note, just in case.

Id: [0x002DF049]
I had no idea. Here one day, gone the next. Thank you for that. You deserve some compensation.

Id: [0x002DF04A]
Over time, I suppose I came to understand them as well as you may understand people. I listen when they speak, and vice versa.

Id: [0x002DF04B]
Bring them to us and we'll see what we can do with them.

Id: [0x002DF04C]
Of course, we haven't got much space to work with just yet. So until you can build us a shipyard, we'll talk of other things.

Id: [0x002DF04D]
If you are wondering what good I will bring to the settlement, you need only look to the greatest empire the world has ever known.

Id: [0x002DF04E]
But you have not seen them restored to their former glory! And I can help.

Id: [0x002DF04F]
I wonder if you know the feeling of having your very heart pulled from your chest as it pursues the elusive object of your desire?

Id: [0x002DF050]
If you should ever see him, give him my regards. By that, I mean spit on him, then recover my statue!

Id: [0x002DF051]
If you happen to find any distinctly Roman artifacts on your travels, bring them by. We can make something of this mess yet.

Id: [0x002DF052]
Well, if you do find something, just bring it here. He'll pay a good price!

Id: [0x002DF053]
As a token of my deep gratitude, I want you to have this.

Id: [0x002DF054]
That is a hopeful way of seeing it. Speak to Randvi when you wish to travel there.

Id: [0x002DF055]
That's right. Someone you know?

Id: [0x002DF056]
You remember Kjotve's son, Gorm? He has since taken his father's place in The Order.

Id: [0x002DF057]
I did. I should send a letter to Hunwald to give him the news. You know how he frets over me.

Id: [0x002DF058]
If you must. I will await your answer, down by the docks. Do not keep me waiting.

Id: [0x002DF059]
Good, good! Lead on.

Id: [0x002DF05A]
As you seem to shun this place as often as possible, it must fall to me.

Id: [0x002DF05B]
But go … find the jarl, bring him back. Only do not get lost along the way, as you seem to more and more these days.

Id: [0x002DF05C]
And what is your take on the mystery? Still believe a wolf or bear did these things?

Id: [0x002DF05D]
I want to kill that man. [beat]Help me.

Id: [0x002DF05E]
Look around you. God's works are wondrous, they cannot be ignored, nor resisted.

Id: [0x002DF05F]
Now, tell me what you know of that breaker of rings. Weak and wretched troll.

Id: [0x002DF060]
Here, take this forgery and pray that King Ricsige sees nothing amiss. I trust you know what you are doing.

Id: [0x002DF061]
Why are you doing this?

Id: [0x002DF062]
Do not blame yourself, drengr.

Id: [0x002DF063]
We know, drengr. That is why we are sworn to you.

Id: [0x002DF064]
Please, my parents are trapped! Help me and help them!

Id: [0x002DF065]
Nine days I hung in the tree! Nine days, you hear me!

Id: [0x002DF066]
O, good. Yes, yes. Honor is good. Olav will help you. Olav will help you so much.

Id: [0x002DF067]
O yes, yes! Olav is helpful. Olav helps in your nameless feud. Olav obeys!

Id: [0x002DF068]
I will tell you everything, even the secrets of earth and sky!

Id: [0x002DF069]
But I will help you with your mysterious errand. I will, I will.

Id: [0x002DF06A]
I can show you. Follow, follow, follow.

Id: [0x002DF06B]
Take this. Some goods to get you started.

Id: [0x002DF06C]
Yes, yes. And elderberries have a good taste, too. And good for you.

Id: [0x002DF06D]
A relief to these ears … I've already packed my bags.

Id: [0x002DF06E]
As best as I know how. It is good to be here, with you and your people. I feel my life has found a new road.

Id: [0x002DF06F]
But we found a dog that needs your help! She's caught in a trap down there!

Id: [0x002DF070]
And if you intend to go hunting … consider bringing us your kills. We will prepare the hides and heads.

Id: [0x002DF071]
If you wish the tales of your hunts to outlast you, there is no better way than making trophies of your kills.

Id: [0x002DF072]
If you defeat a rare and worthy creature, bring it to us. We will display it for you.

Id: [0x002DF073]
I would eliminate them entirely. With your permission, of course. And your help, if possible.

Id: [0x002DF074]
When you can. Thank you.

Id: [0x002DF075]
Still no sign of Wallace. Do you have time to look for him?

Id: [0x002DF076]
As sure as I see you now! He's back! Our guardian is back, leading us to my brother!

Id: [0x002DF077]
No, no. Petra hasn't disappeared. She's close, very close. And waiting for you.

Id: [0x002DF078]
There's no trick to it. I think about it, and it works. Easy as walking. Try it!

Id: [0x002DF079]
I … I knew that. I was expecting that-- O, what a fool I am.

Id: [0x002DF07A]
How sweet of you, love. Come here.

Id: [0x002DF07B]
To live one's life in so small a pen. And hear stories from you and the scouts without ever venturing further.

Id: [0x002DF07C]
[inhale]Gods, do you smell that? The earth and the air. It is good to be out here.

Id: [0x002DF07D]
Come on, what do you say?

Id: [0x002DF07E]
Ha! I am the Mead-Queen! Slayer of Wolves and Barrels! I told you I would drink you under the table.

Id: [0x002DF07F]
Hm. I find that … disappointing. If I were you, I might have tested the waters.

Id: [0x002DF080]
Just as beautiful as Sunniva's stories tell. Can you imagine how it looked when it was first built, hundreds of winters ago?

Id: [0x002DF081]
You jest, but I have raised the frames of longhouses and hammered the ribs of longships.

Id: [0x002DF082]
Thank you for today. Every bit of it has been a dream and … and I am not keen to wake.

Id: [0x002DF083]
Many times I wished to tell you. Wished to say what was in my heart and what I desired, but duty kept me from it.

Id: [0x002DF084]
I understand. Thank you for your bluntness. I will trouble you no more.

Id: [0x002DF085]
I am … I am happy to hear that.

Id: [0x002DF086]
No need, but a desire. An earnest one. I remember the good things people do for me. To warm my heart in times when…

Id: [0x002DF087]
…when kindnesses are few and far between. There was one more thing, though, if you had a moment.

Id: [0x002DF088]
Your reputation. Heard folks say a band of hard-drinking, battle-scarred warriors had washed up on shore.

Id: [0x002DF089]
Yes, he's a clever one, and rather kind when you meet him. Makes you feel like you're a friend. Family, even.

Id: [0x002DF08A]
If you wish to clear Tarben's name, I'm happy to help with that. It's only a small matter of cost…

Id: [0x002DF08B]
Camped not far to the west. A battalion of bloated, brainwashed military men. You can't miss it for the smell.

Id: [0x002DF08C]
I will, you have my word.

Id: [0x002DF08D]
You handled that better than I would have.

Id: [0x002DF08E]
I suppose you don't build a clan of warriors without seeing your share of danger.

Id: [0x002DF08F]
You have an empathy. I see it in your eyes, having witnessed its absence in so many.

Id: [0x002DF090]
May I … may I kiss you?

Id: [0x002DF091]
And that someday I may find someone as earnestly good and noble as yourself.

Id: [0x002DF092]
Shall I escort you back to the longhouse?

Id: [0x002DF093]
A lover?

Id: [0x002DF094]
Ah! Salve, Eivor. How are you?

Id: [0x002DF095]
This is my doing. I brought all this upon you. It is down to me to fix it.

Id: [0x002DF096]
That would be lovely. I was just about to get in some archery practice if you'd like to join me.

Id: [0x002DF097]
Ah, I was just thinking about you.

Id: [0x002DF098]
Hello, love. Always nice to see your face.

Id: [0x002DF099]
You did not take me for a baker, either.

Id: [0x002DF09A]
You're going to make me jealous!

Id: [0x002DF09B]
I must say, I used to like fishing alone. But now, whenever I do, I miss your presence.

Id: [0x002DF09C]
Your jealousy is adorable.

Id: [0x002DF09D]
Even when we aren't saying a word, your company is wonderful. Thank you for a beautiful day.

Id: [0x002DF09E]
You… you…

Id: [0x002DF09F]
As I am honored by your love.

Id: [0x002DF0A0]
As I am honored by your friendship.

Id: [0x002DF0A1]
We share a love that is steadfast. And I have faith it will forever be so, but my heart is yours. That much he knows.

Id: [0x002DF0A2]
I have all I need right here. With you, with our people.

Id: [0x002DF0A3]
I give you my word that it will always be so. I'm happiest by your side and in your company.

Id: [0x002DF0A4]
My place is here. In this settlement, by your side.

Id: [0x002DF0A5]
How do you feel?

Id: [0x002DF0A6]
As I learn more, I can give you insight into each territory, before you commit to a journey there.

Id: [0x002DF0A7]
You have two options just now. Join Sigurd in Ledecestrescire to the north, and meet with the Sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.

Id: [0x002DF0A8]
Do you mean now? Right now?

Id: [0x002DF0A9]
Now, what was it you needed?

Id: [0x002DF0AA]
Painful to hear, and painful to admit. But you may be right. It was … foolish of me to think it could lead somewhere.

Id: [0x002DF0AB]
I feared as much when this letter arrived. From one called Fulke, addressed to you.

Id: [0x002DF0AC]
Good. I would like to hear everything about your journey to Vinland when you have time.

Id: [0x002DF0AD]
I remember the young man. He will make a fine addition to your crew.

Id: [0x002DF0AE]
When you are able, you should visit with him. See what this is about.

Id: [0x002DF0AF]
My scouts did not meet them in person, so I can say little for the state of their army. Consider this a starting point.

Id: [0x002DF0B0]
Good. And may the blessings of Freyja follow.

Id: [0x002DF0B1]
Good. I will send word to Sigurd and the Ragnarssons, pledging your assistance.

Id: [0x002DF0B2]
If I were you, I would go by ship. Repton is quite a distance north on the river Trent.

Id: [0x002DF0B3]
I suggest you make for East Anglia and find out what their steward is doing wrong.

Id: [0x002DF0B4]
There is an alehouse at the center of Buckingham. Sigurd will meet you there.

Id: [0x002DF0B5]
Along the Great Ouse river that divides Oxenefordscire. Sigurd will be pleased to see you.

Id: [0x002DF0B6]
Basim has written, claiming to have found the woman Fulke and asking for your aid. He has taken shelter at Saint Hadrian's Priory.

Id: [0x002DF0B7]
A rather boisterous man named Hunwald arrived recently, wishing to speak with you. On a matter of great importance, he said.

Id: [0x002DF0B8]
Down at the docks, carousing with my scouts and scaring the fish from the river. He waits for you with great eagerness.

Id: [0x002DF0B9]
Well, it seems. Vili asks that you join him in feast and celebration, in honor of his father, Hemming Jarl.

Id: [0x002DF0BB]
He is currently entangled in a war with the Picts of the northern hills. I suspect he wants your council. Or your axe.

Id: [0x002DF0BC]
Good. I await your return.

Id: [0x002DF0BD]
Your hidden ally. Very interesting. More targets I assume.

Id: [0x002DF0BE]
And very heavily guarded. King Aelfred is preparing for war. You will meet tremendous resistance.

Id: [0x002DF0BF]
That is for you to decide. The more alliances you have, the better your chances at victory.

Id: [0x002DF0C0]
What happened yesterday? You and Sigurd disappeared during the feast.

Id: [0x002DF0C1]
Do you think Sigurd knows? About us?

Id: [0x002DF0C2]
Yet he does speak with you. With me, he has gone totally silent.

Id: [0x002DF0C3]
Well, besides forging the finest weapons and armor in the land, I am happy to set to work on anything you find.

Id: [0x002DF0C4]
I can restore all weapons to their former glory. And well beyond, if that is what's wanted. I can improve any blade.

Id: [0x002DF0C5]
So as long as you have the resources and the cargo, I will gladly work on your gear.

Id: [0x002DF0C6]
O, no, Eivor… You've been away. Sorry to say, Svend passed away not two nights ago. In his sleep.

Id: [0x002DF0C7]
Taking it hard. Very hard. You ought to go and have a word with her. Far as I know, she's barely left his grave.

Id: [0x002DF0C8]
Anyhow … you probably need something, eh?

Id: [0x002DF0C9]
Ha! Those invaders never stood a chance. Not when you are armed with Gunnar's handiwork.

Id: [0x002DF0CA]
Can't imagine what you are feeling.

Id: [0x002DF0CB]
Eivor! I wanted to thank you, on behalf of myself and Brigid. Our wedding was the greatest day of my life.

Id: [0x002DF0CC]
And it could never have gone so well without you.

Id: [0x002DF0CD]
What don't I do here? You're looking at a man of boundless skill and talent.

Id: [0x002DF0CE]
O, that old scrap? Yes, it's just a short letter from one Hidden One to another. One of my rarest artifacts.

Id: [0x002DF0CF]
Anyway, the letter is written in demotic, so it may not mean much to you. But you're free to have a look.

Id: [0x002DF0D0]
That could be. If you had a mind to deliver them yourself, I would cut you in. Surely they wouldn't refuse you payment.

Id: [0x002DF0D1]
A cask of rosewater mead! I never thought that would get here. You're an angel sent from Heaven.

Id: [0x002DF0D2]
We keep your longship fine and fit. My husband focuses on style and appearance.

Id: [0x002DF0D3]
Whereas my beloved wife concerns herself with speed and functionality. And if you happen to find any ship plans about…

Id: [0x002DF0D4]
Salve, Eivor! We have not yet been introduced. I am Octavian Claudius Britannicus, a collector of Roman relics.

Id: [0x002DF0D5]
What? He … he gave this to you? That perfect little wretch, how did he bring himself to part with it?

Id: [0x002DF0D6]
Wonderful. And here is something for you!

Id: [0x002DF0D7]
It's not from me! My grandfather insisted we give it to you.

Id: [0x002DF0D8]
But you had best get some barracks built soon. I need a place to cage these beasts.

Id: [0x002DF0D9]
Which reminds me. A few of your raiders are chomping at the bit in hope of becoming your second. You ought to pick one.

Id: [0x002DF0DA]
Then go in peace.

Id: [0x002DF0DB]
Do you need something?

Id: [0x002DF0DC]
King Aelfred? Did our Poor Fellow-Soldier lead you to his hiding place?

Id: [0x002DF0DD]
You know, the black market merchant Reda has an old piece of writing from the same era as the codex pages you found.

Id: [0x002DF0DE]
I do not understand. Why would he do such a thing? He loved Sigurd. He loved you!

Id: [0x002DF0DF]
Ah, here is something for you. An odd letter arrived a few days ago. Signed by one calling himself--

Id: [0x002DF0E0]
The letter says you must travel to Wincestre, visit God's house, and look for a man in white. Then recite this passage…

Id: [0x002DF0E1]
A Master of The Order, hewn from the trunk of their dying tree. You are getting closer to the roots.

Id: [0x002DF0E2]
I have something here for you. Tidings that may displease you.

Id: [0x002DF0E3]
Before you go. I learned something that may displease you. Kjotve's son, Gorm, has followed in his father's footsteps.

Id: [0x002DF0E4]
Vinland is far away, according my source. It may take weeks to find him, after a long and perilous journey.

Id: [0x002DF0E5]
And I will be here.

Id: [0x002DF0E6]
That is right. Passage to across the seas to Saint Brendan's land, is that right?

Id: [0x002DF0E7]
I know I have been in a fog these last few weeks. I know I speak words you don't fully understand.

Id: [0x002DF0E8]
But I only ask you trust me, once more. On my final voyage. Back to Norway, to wish my father farewell, and achieve my destiny.

Id: [0x002DF0E9]
Eivor, there you are. I have something for you. A message … quite strange.

Id: [0x002DF0EA]
A letter, requesting your presence in the southwest. A village called Athelnay.

Id: [0x002DF0EB]
Though this battle you may win, this war you will not. Your foe will be your master, your hope will be your grief.

Id: [0x002DF0EC]
But I will not be joining you.

Id: [0x002DF0ED]
And while you are there, be on the lookout for our symbol. Centuries ago, the Hidden Ones had bureaus built around England.

Id: [0x002DF0EE]
No … no mortal hand could rend flesh in such a way. Surely you see that.

Id: [0x002DF0EF]
I should say the same of you. Most heathens would point to witchcraft or monsters, but you seek an earthly cause.

Id: [0x002DF0F0]
Back, you! Back, I say. I can still draw blood.

Id: [0x002DF0F1]
Play. Grendel only want to play. You make Grendel hurt.

Id: [0x002DF0F2]
You! You smell like my son. My son's blood! Where is he? Where is my boy?

Id: [0x002DF0F3]
Ask the dead. [beat]What do they tell you?

Id: [0x002DF0F4]
Go with my bear, fill her belly. [beat]And if Njal trusts you, who knows? Maybe we do as you say.

Id: [0x002DF0F5]
No, your words are wise. I do not want to die fighting. I want to die knowing my wife is avenged.

Id: [0x002DF0F6]
When you find the nightshade, bring it to me beneath the gallows tree south of Beodoricsworth.

Id: [0x002DF0F7]
Berserker brew hits hard. It may open your eyes to the spirit realm. It may turn you into a savage beast.

Id: [0x002DF0F9]
You wolf-shirts, you drinkers of blood?

Id: [0x002DF0FA]
Just now, they sit on their thumbs in the church. Talking in circles. Come, I will take you to him.

Id: [0x002DF0FB]
And Sigurd? He is back with you?

Id: [0x002DF0FD]
I will follow your lead.

Id: [0x002DF0FE]
Aye! Free us and we will fight by your side.

Id: [0x002DF0FF]
Do you think he kept his word? He swore he would not kill them.

Id: [0x002DF100]
How is your brother Sigurd?

Id: [0x002DF101]
And so to our final battle. [beat]We will wait for you at the camp.

Id: [0x002DF102]
Innocents will die for your ambitions. I am your ally now, but after this, I must turn back to Mercia. I have much to repent.

Id: [0x002DF103]
If drinking and feasting be in my future, I will follow you to Hel.

Id: [0x002DF104]
I gave you my word. Besides … Aelfred's faith is strict, and he has no love for pagans.

Id: [0x002DF105]
In fact, I composed a poem for the occasion. Would you like to hear it?

Id: [0x002DF106]
Your young Saxons can be our eyes to the west. Better to keep their soft hands away from the conflict.

Id: [0x002DF107]
You cannot win England with your sorry crew of deluded farmers and godless fools.

Id: [0x002DF108]
You have no understanding of duty, the loyalty I freely give. His plan for England, for the world, is worth the cost of my life.

Id: [0x002DF109]
We could have been allies, but now you'll fall by my sword.

Id: [0x002DF10A]
No. But your Saxon boys were ambushed. One lays wounded.

Id: [0x002DF10B]
Your Freyja would, too.

Id: [0x002DF10C]
That slippery eel may yet surprise you.

Id: [0x002DF10D]
Stowe is taking matters hard. You know how sensitive he is.

Id: [0x002DF10E]
His support for you has taxed him hard. I will take him back to Lunden. Maybe he will find some comfort there.

Id: [0x002DF10F]
You can always fight with me if you want to taste crushing and loin-soiling defeat.

Id: [0x002DF110]
Time to send our friends to their great reward. Will you do the honors?

Id: [0x002DF111]
I am grateful for your help.

Id: [0x002DF112]
The Picts are just ahead. Lead the way and we'll watch your back.

Id: [0x002DF113]
Have you come to join your fallen? Hah!

Id: [0x002DF114]
Ah, thank you for your help. Come by my stall should you have a craving for pie.

Id: [0x002DF115]
If you drop by Jorvik again, please join us for an ale. I know of a place down the street.

Id: [0x002DF116]
Eivor? Perfect. I could use your edge right now.

Id: [0x002DF117]
Should be up there in the trees ahead. Can you smell it? It stinks of death and evil.

Id: [0x002DF118]
Ha! He was no match for you!

Id: [0x002DF119]
I'm not coming out. And you're not coming in!

Id: [0x002DF11A]
Put that aside. My ship waits at Wulfaswic to spirit Estrid from these shores. What would you have of us?

Id: [0x002DF11B]
Are you not? Dark news, dark deeds. My heart burns for vengeance, but what will it bring? I will be a king on a throne of skulls.

Id: [0x002DF11C]
Another matter that needs my attention. I will meet you at the camp.

Id: [0x002DF11D]
All is ready, and your allies have arrived. Speak to them if you like. I'll be here when you're done.

Id: [0x002DF11E]
We thrive, just as we did our first year. And I have you to thank for that.

Id: [0x002DF11F]
Modron will have taken Tewdwr to her forest temple. If you make haste, you might be able to stay her blade.

Id: [0x002DF120]
That's what you think! These three items here are true treasures!

Id: [0x002DF121]
I could get a better shot at his head from above.

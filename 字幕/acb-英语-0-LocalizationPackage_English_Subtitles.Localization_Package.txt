Id: [0x000078FF]
Perhaps another time.

Id: [0x00007900]
Next time then.

Id: [0x00007901]
Well, I’ll be here should you need me.

Id: [0x00007911]
Please come again!

Id: [0x00007912]
Glad to be service.

Id: [0x00007913]
Tell your friends about me!

Id: [0x0000F0BC]
Another time then.

Id: [0x0000F0BD]
We’re open most days, should you change your mind.

Id: [0x0000F0BE]
Perhaps later then, ciao!

Id: [0x0000F1FF]
A pleasure! Do come again.

Id: [0x0000F200]
Come and see me next you pass this way!

Id: [0x0000F201]
Ciao Signore, mention me to your amici!

Id: [0x00014C74]
Please, come back anytime.

Id: [0x00014C75]
Till next time, arrivederci Messere!

Id: [0x00014C76]
Ciao Signore! Hope to see you again!

Id: [0x00014C77]
Perhaps another time…

Id: [0x00014C78]
Indeed, well so long.

Id: [0x00014C79]
Prossima volta, no?

Id: [0x0003508F]
Come on, Desmond! Let's go!

Id: [0x00035090]
Over here, Desmond!

Id: [0x00035091]
This way!

Id: [0x00035092]
Follow me!

Id: [0x00035093]
What are you doing, Desmond? Follow me!

Id: [0x000382D7]
Alright! Va bene! I'm sorry! I'll be a better husband, I swear! Just leave me alone!

Id: [0x000382D8]
You win! You win! I'm the stronzo! Scusatemi, I'll try to change my ways, I promise!

Id: [0x000382D9]
Dannato! She wins! I give up! That bitch... I mean wonderful wife of mine... hehe... I'll go home...

Id: [0x000382DA]
That cagna sent you? Here, you can take her back a message from me!

Id: [0x000382DB]
Oh yes, big tough man protecting my wife! Idiota, I'll teach you to meddle!

Id: [0x000382DC]
You should have minded your own business (spit)!

Id: [0x000382DD]
You came to defend MY wife’s honour? Ha!

Id: [0x000382DE]
I’ll go home at once! And be good! I promise!

Id: [0x000382DF]
I’ll teach you to mind your own business!

Id: [0x000382E0]
I’m sorry! I regret it! Truly! I’m going straight home! I swear!

Id: [0x000382E1]
You should not have gotten involved!

Id: [0x000382E2]
She’s right! Of course! I’ll go home immediately!

Id: [0x000382E3]
What has this to do with you, stronzo!

Id: [0x000382E4]
You win! She’s right! I’m sorry!

Id: [0x000382E5]
I’ll be good! No more women! Just her! I promise!

Id: [0x000382E6]
So why do you care, ehi? Here!

Id: [0x000382E7]
You should have stayed out of it!

Id: [0x000382E8]
Of course! What was I thinking! My wife! I do love her… hehe!

Id: [0x000382EF]
What did my wife send you? That harridan should mind her business, as should you!

Id: [0x000382F0]
Damn it! I'm sorry! Never again!

Id: [0x000382F1]
You win! Tell her I'll be a good, faithful husband!

Id: [0x000382F2]
Upholding my wife's honour? What's she to you then, eh!?

Id: [0x000382F3]
You've made your point Messere! I'll be good, I swear!

Id: [0x000382F4]
Ah, that bitch sent you, didn't she? You should not have come here!

Id: [0x000382F8]
Not now, come back in less… troubled times, yes?

Id: [0x000382FB]
That faithless husband of mine is cheating! I know it! As do all the neighbours… please, teach him a lesson for me.

Id: [0x000382FC]
My husband carries on with wanton sluts! My reputation… and I’m stuck with the bastard! Please, make him feel my displeasure.

Id: [0x00038301]
The guard's spies will see us… come back when they’ve gone.

Id: [0x00038304]
After eight years of marriage that figlio di puttana is back with his old woman! Teach him to respect his vows, please!

Id: [0x0003830A]
I can’t talk now… you draw unwanted attention.

Id: [0x0003830D]
It is said you often help the common folk… could I ask you to beat some sense into my rotten, aldulterous, joke of a husband?

Id: [0x00038313]
Not now. You are in great danger!

Id: [0x00038316]
A delicate matter… but important to me. Could you persuade the idiot I married to come home to me, and stay home? I implore you!

Id: [0x00038325]
Come back later, they are on to you!

Id: [0x0003832B]
I need this delivered right away! If you’re quick, I’ll make it worth your while!

Id: [0x0003832E]
Well done! My thanks friend!

Id: [0x00038331]
You draw too much attention! Return later, yes?

Id: [0x00038332]
Could you deliver this for me? It must be done quickly, but there is a reward.

Id: [0x00038333]
Excellent! I knew I could trust you.

Id: [0x0003833D]
I was right to trust you, grazie amico!

Id: [0x0003833F]
Return later, it seems you are in some peril.

Id: [0x00038340]
Please get this delivered on time and I’ll repay you handsomely!

Id: [0x00038349]
Well done. I knew I could count on you!

Id: [0x0003834A]
Please hurry and give this to my friend. I will reward you well if you are fast!

Id: [0x0003834C]
Dannato, they’re onto you! Return later, yes?

Id: [0x00038356]
Get this to its destination fast. Really fast. I’ll pay you well.

Id: [0x00038357]
Fantastico! Grazie amico!

Id: [0x00038358]
Come back when the guard are less suspicious.

Id: [0x00038361]
Shit, they’re everywhere. We’ll talk later!

Id: [0x00038367]
I’m the best racer in this rione. They say you’re pretty good. I say prove it!

Id: [0x0003836B]
On three, one, two, three!

Id: [0x0003836D]
I can outrun anyone in these rioni, but I hear you’re the best anywhere. Prove it!

Id: [0x0003836E]
Ready, set, go!

Id: [0x0003836F]
You’ll have to lose the evil eyes and return later friend.

Id: [0x00038385]
I can't talk now!

Id: [0x00038387]
This is my turf. I can outrun any man I know here, but a little bird told me you're quite good. Care to prove it?

Id: [0x00038389]
On three. One, two, three!

Id: [0x00038393]
I hear you’re pretty fast. I’m a bit of speedster myself… you would honour me by granting a quick race…

Id: [0x00038813]
You’ll feel a little sting.

Id: [0x00038814]
Grit your teeth, eh?

Id: [0x00038815]
This may pinch, but you’re a big boy, yes?

Id: [0x00038816]
Think of something else while I apply the leeches.

Id: [0x00038817]
You may feel a little pain.

Id: [0x00038818]
This may involve some… discomfort.

Id: [0x00038819]
Hold steady, this will hurt a bit.

Id: [0x0003881A]
Try not to move, it makes the pain worse.

Id: [0x0003881B]
Be still and you’ll feel the burning less

Id: [0x0003881F]
This won’t hurt a bit.

Id: [0x00038820]
The sting is only when the leech attaches itself…

Id: [0x00038821]
The pain won’t last long, I promise.

Id: [0x00038E61]
Excellent sir! A true patron of the arts!

Id: [0x00038E63]
Perhaps I will have something for you next time.

Id: [0x00038E65]
Another time then sir.

Id: [0x00038E67]
Ah, most astute choices good sir!

Id: [0x00038E69]
Va bene sir, please come again!

Id: [0x00038E6C]
Next time then, addio.

Id: [0x00038E6D]
A pleasure sir, come again!

Id: [0x00038E6F]
Next time, I’m sure!

Id: [0x00038E73]
Grazie for your patronage!

Id: [0x00038E74]
No matter, have a good day sir!

Id: [0x00038E75]
I will find something more to your liking next time sir!

Id: [0x00038E76]
Thank you, do come again!

Id: [0x00038E7A]
A pleasure doing business!

Id: [0x00038E7B]
Ah well, next time, yes?

Id: [0x00038E7D]
Don’t forget to send your friends!

Id: [0x00038E80]
Perhaps another time.

Id: [0x00038E81]
Grazie, and come again!

Id: [0x00038E84]
Va bene, I understand… I’ll have more altarpieces brought in!

Id: [0x00038E85]
Next time then sir!

Id: [0x00038E87]
Ottimo, molte grazie!

Id: [0x00038E89]
Grazie, and come again sir!

Id: [0x00038E8C]
Addio then.

Id: [0x00038E8F]
A pleasure, grazie for your business!

Id: [0x00038E90]
Perhaps another time, arrivederci!

Id: [0x00038E91]
Perhaps another time then.

Id: [0x00038E92]
I’m open most days should you change your mind.

Id: [0x00038E93]
Oh well, next time. Ciao!

Id: [0x00038E97]
A pleasure Messere, come again!

Id: [0x00038E98]
Addio then! Mention me to your friends, eh?

Id: [0x00038E99]
Thank you, til next time sir!

Id: [0x00038E9E]
Come again!

Id: [0x00038EA0]
Oh! Poorly dressed a while longer it seems!

Id: [0x00038EA1]
Do return, you need my help!

Id: [0x00038EA4]
I’ve more coming in soon, don’t be a straniero!

Id: [0x00038EA5]
Remember to visit me often! Fashion is a whimsical mistress!

Id: [0x00038EA6]
Another time then.

Id: [0x00038EA9]
Next time then!

Id: [0x00038EAB]
A pleasure! Come again!

Id: [0x00038EAD]
Of course, I understand. Another time.

Id: [0x00038EAE]
An excellent choice, Signore!

Id: [0x00038EB1]
Ah but you’ll be back, Signore! Until then, addio!

Id: [0x00038EB3]
A wise purchase, good day Signore!

Id: [0x00038EB6]
Eh, another time then.

Id: [0x00038EB8]
Excellent! Addio then!

Id: [0x00038EBA]
Eh, no harm in browsing, ciao!

Id: [0x00038EBC]
A smart choice, ciao for now!

Id: [0x00038EBE]
Enjoy your purchase, and come again!

Id: [0x00038EC0]
Not what you were after, I understand.

Id: [0x00038EC1]
Another time then Messere!

Id: [0x00038EC3]
Another satisfied client! Arrivederci!

Id: [0x00038EC5]
Of course I understand, ciao then!

Id: [0x00038EC8]
Va bene! Addio then!

Id: [0x00038ECA]
Next time then, addio Messere.

Id: [0x00038ECB]
Bene, bene! See you next time!

Id: [0x0004114A]
Desmond! Over here!

Id: [0x0004114B]
Come on! We need to keep moving!

Id: [0x0004114C]
Hey! Over here!

Id: [0x000412F0]
You should feel better now, take care!

Id: [0x000412F1]
I’ve done what I could, but perhaps you should avoid the deeds that brought you here!

Id: [0x000412F2]
That’s better for now, but prevention is the best cure, I always say.

Id: [0x000412F3]
Oh well, next time amico.

Id: [0x000412F4]
I will be here should you need me.

Id: [0x000412F5]
Ciao for now then, I am here most days should you need aid.

Id: [0x000412FC]
You should feel better now, but take care in future!

Id: [0x000412FD]
I’ve done what I can, try not to reopen the wound.

Id: [0x000412FE]
A bit of rest and you should be well recovered, friend.

Id: [0x000412FF]
I’ll be close by should you return.

Id: [0x00041300]
I’m here most days should you require my aid.

Id: [0x00041301]
Next time then, buona fortuna!

Id: [0x00041308]
May wellness remain your companion, friend.

Id: [0x00041309]
You look stronger already!

Id: [0x0004130A]
Farewell and swift recovery, amico!

Id: [0x0004130B]
Another time then.

Id: [0x0004130C]
As you will, perhaps another day.

Id: [0x0004130D]
I’ll be here should you have need of me.

Id: [0x00041314]
Auf weidersehen! …that’s French.

Id: [0x00041315]
Come back and see me if the arm turns black.

Id: [0x00041316]
Please try to avoid pointy objects in future, ok?

Id: [0x00041317]
Alright, perhaps later.

Id: [0x00041318]
So long for now then, return if you need aid.

Id: [0x00041319]
I’ll be here should you wish to return.

Id: [0x000453A0]
Well, one man’s coin is as good as another’s.

Id: [0x000453A1]
No offence, but I didn’t think you had the money.

Id: [0x000453A2]
Well, I suppose you only appear to be common…

Id: [0x000453A3]
Hmm… si, I din't think so.

Id: [0x000453A4]
Indeed. My clients are generally much nobler.

Id: [0x000453A5]
Out of pocket Messere? What a shame.

Id: [0x000453AE]
Come again, please!

Id: [0x000453AF]
You’ll be well satisfied, I know it!

Id: [0x000453B0]
Send me your amici!

Id: [0x000453B1]
Oh well, I can’t have everything in stock I suppose.

Id: [0x000453B2]
Another time then.

Id: [0x000453B3]
Come again should you change your mind.

Id: [0x000453BD]
This may feel unpleasant.

Id: [0x000453BE]
Clench your teeth…

Id: [0x000453BF]
Hold still, there is pain in healing.

Id: [0x000453C3]
That should feel better soon.

Id: [0x000453C4]
Ah yes, much better friend, you’ll see.

Id: [0x000453C5]
That’s it, come back anytime.

Id: [0x000453C6]
Another time then.

Id: [0x000453C7]
I’ll be here should you need me.

Id: [0x000453C8]
Return if you need my aid.

Id: [0x00045D4A]
Vattene! Via del mio terreno! (Go away! Get off my land!)

Id: [0x0004623C]
Absorbing a small impact.

Id: [0x0004623D]
Absorbing a small impact.

Id: [0x0004623E]
Absorbing a small impact.

Id: [0x0004623F]
Absorbing a small impact.

Id: [0x00046240]
Absorbing a medium impact.

Id: [0x00046241]
Absorbing a medium impact.

Id: [0x00046242]
Absorbing a medium impact.

Id: [0x00046243]
Absorbing a medium impact.

Id: [0x000464AA]
Uh, Rebecca? What's going on...

Id: [0x000464AB]
So much for that. What now?

Id: [0x000464AC]
We look for a stable memory. I wonder...

Id: [0x000464AF]
Okay. Let me know when you've found something.

Id: [0x000464B1]
Really, Desmond?

Id: [0x000464B2]
What?

Id: [0x000464B4]
There. Not exactly what we wanted, but it's a start.

Id: [0x000464C0]
Uh, Rebecca? What's going on...

Id: [0x000464C2]
I don't know. Hold on. I'm scanning the data. It looks like Ezio is... remembering something.

Id: [0x000464C4]
Like a memory in a memory?

Id: [0x000464C5]
Yes. Exactly.

Id: [0x000464C6]
Hmmm. That's a first. Can you skip it?

Id: [0x000464CA]
No.

Id: [0x000464CB]
Then what's the plan?

Id: [0x000464CC]
We'll have to send you into these new memories. Hopefully completing them will bring you back to where you need to be.

Id: [0x000464CE]
Okay. Let me know when you've found something.

Id: [0x000464D0]
Really, Desmond?

Id: [0x000464D1]
What?

Id: [0x000464D3]
There. Not exactly what we wanted, but it's a start.

Id: [0x000464D8]
What might you tell me? And at what cost?

Id: [0x000464DB]
(Careful, nephew!)

Id: [0x000464DC]
Mario?

Id: [0x000464DE]
Come. It's time to bring you home...

Id: [0x000464E3]
Alright, explain it to me one last time.

Id: [0x000464E4]
We want you to look through Ezio's memories and see if you can figure out what happened to The Apple. If it's still in Italy and if there's a way for us retrieve it - we'd have answers to a lot of our questions - and a major advantage over Abstergo.

Id: [0x000464E6]
Any idea where we should start?

Id: [0x000464E8]
Here.

Id: [0x000464EA]
Better to focus on the world that is - not the one that might have been.

Id: [0x000464EB]
You've changed, Ezio. When last we spoke, hope had fled you.

Id: [0x000464EC]
I recaptured her.

Id: [0x000464ED]
Why?

Id: [0x000464EE]
So that she might be shared with others.

Id: [0x000464F0]
Your idealism concerns me. I fear it may blind you to the danger we now face.

Id: [0x000464F1]
Better I should cower in fear? Drown myself in memories of the past? Throw up my hands in resignation?

Id: [0x000464F3]
I tried all those things and none sufficed. Do you know why? Because no change came of them. Don't label me an idealist simply because I have hope. It is a dangerous thing you intimate.

Id: [0x000464F4]
Don't fault me for being practical. We are what? A few dozen at best?

Id: [0x000464F5]
And in time, with work, we'll be a few dozen more.

Id: [0x000464F6]
And in time, Cesare's gaze will return to us and we'll be broken again.

Id: [0x000464F7]
What do you propose, Machiavelli? I assume there is a point to this?

Id: [0x000464F8]
Only that this is going to be very difficult.

Id: [0x000464F9]
It's like the Oracle of Delphi...

Id: [0x000464FA]
Who?

Id: [0x000464FB]
Oracles were supposed to have the power of divination. They peered into the future. Saw things. History says they were quacks - peddling prophecy for dollars. Their visions were assumed to be the result of inhaling natural gas. Vidic though there was another possible explanation: First civilization technology. It's possible some of them were even first civilization survivors or descendants.

Id: [0x000464FC]
sss

Id: [0x000464FD]
So many of these acts bear all of trappings of religion - the accessories of faith. But it's insincere. Just a facade.

Id: [0x000464FE]
I believe that many of these men and women mean well. That they seek to live their lives according to their own creed. To do no harm. To neither lie nor cheat nor steal.

Id: [0x000464FF]
But these words of comfort - edicts to be moral and just - have been vanquished and corrupted.

Id: [0x00046500]
Belief becomes a commodity. Bargained for. Often stolen.

Id: [0x0004650C]
Well? Are we just going to stand around gawking at it all day? Pick it up, Desmond.

Id: [0x0004650D]
Is it safe?

Id: [0x0004650E]
Based on what I read at Abstergo, it won't do anything unless you WANT it to. So pick it up Desmond. Just don't... think about it.

Id: [0x0004650F]
Oh, sure. No problem.

Id: [0x00046511]
So far so good.

Id: [0x00046514]
Desmond!

Id: [0x00046517]
Now I understand.

Id: [0x0004651C]
As am I. Had I killed Rodrigo, as I set out to do, we'd not be here now.

Id: [0x0004651E]
I'll not hear it. One should never regret compassion nor see it as a mistake.

Id: [0x0004651F]
The Assassin's Creed is clear: Do not compromise the clan. But I have... And many lost their lives because of it.

Id: [0x00046521]
I know you are meant to abide by this code and its three tenets. But what is the principle that guides them? Hmm? "Nothing is true." Altair himself recognized as much. That adherence to a set of rules was an arcane thing. Dangerous, even.

Id: [0x00046523]
Besides - It was Cesare who led the attack. Who's to say the same would not have happened had you slain Rordigo? They are Templars. You Assassins. I think this conflict was inevitable.

Id: [0x00046524]
What you say and how I feel are very much at odds.

Id: [0x00046526]
Perhaps in time my words will penetrate.

Id: [0x00046527]
Perhaps... [a beat] And what of you, Leonardo? Back to Milano?

Id: [0x00046528]
Yes, though not for long. This business with the French has changed many things. I think it best I return to Venice.

Id: [0x00046529]
Stay well, my friend. And remember, you can call upon me any time.

Id: [0x00046533]
Alius et idem. (Something else, yet still the same.)

Id: [0x00046537]
It is done. The message is delivered. We are gone now from this world. All of us. We can do no more. The rest is up to you, Desmond.

Id: [0x00046539]
What? Who is Desmond? I don’t understand… Please, wait! I have so many questions!

Id: [0x0004653A]
Uh, Rebecca? We did this part already. What's going on...

Id: [0x0004653D]
I don't know. It looks like Ezio is... remembering something.

Id: [0x0004653F]
Like a memory in a memory?

Id: [0x00046540]
Yes. Exactly. [pause] Maybe.

Id: [0x00046541]
Exactly maybe?

Id: [0x00046542]
Some of it's Ezio. Some of it's the Animus. I mean, he's thinking about the past - but the Animus is forcing us to do it too.

Id: [0x00046543]
Why?

Id: [0x00046544]
Good question.

Id: [0x00046545]
If I could just chime in? Minerva's little speech suggested the first civilization had some understanding of quantum mechanics. What if this is all intentional. Pre-planned somehow. It's certainly convenient the way events are constantly conspiring to keep us from where we need to be.

Id: [0x00046547]
Either that or you're just not a very good engineer, Rebecca.

Id: [0x00046548]
Thanks Shaun.

Id: [0x00046549]
What? Both theories are equally valid.

Id: [0x0004654D]
Sorry Desmond, it looks like we'll have to send you into these new memories if we want to fix the problem.

Id: [0x0004654E]
We had a similar issue the first time Desmond used the Animus back at Abstergo.

Id: [0x0004654F]
Hmmm. Perhaps it's user error, then?

Id: [0x00046553]
Claudia! Claudia!

Id: [0x00046555]
Ezio? What's happened?

Id: [0x00046556]
Later. We need to go.

Id: [0x00046558]
Madre... (Mother...)

Id: [0x0004655A]
Now, Claudia!

Id: [0x0004655D]
Ser Ezio, a pleasure.

Id: [0x0004655F]
Come in. Make yourselves at home.

Id: [0x00046561]
You'll find no better a place to conduct your business in all of Roma. Some redecorating might be in order, but she's sturdy and secure.

Id: [0x00046564]
Four walls and a roof is all we need. This will do.

Id: [0x00046565]
For now.

Id: [0x00046568]
Come.

Id: [0x0004656A]
Assassin influence has waned in Rome. Our outposts here, managed by the Orsini family, have never been large.

Id: [0x0004656C]
But recently we've started losing what little ground we had.

Id: [0x0004656E]
The Borgia have forged an alliance with Louis XII, giving them access to Swiss Mercenaries and French troops.

Id: [0x00046571]
With Rome firmly in his power, Cesare now leads men into Romagna, hoping to conquer the countryside - and in time, all of Italia (Italy).

Id: [0x00046572]
We will stop him.

Id: [0x00046573]
Of course. But how? Our loss at Monteriggioni has cost us - not only in terms of manpower, but influence as well. Those we once considered allies now cower. They will not fight.

Id: [0x00046574]
Nor need they. Not yet, at least.

Id: [0x00046575]
What do you suggest?

Id: [0x00046576]
We work here. In Rome. Erode the Borgia's influence while restoring our own. Destabilize the city sufficiently and Cesare will return. But he'll be forced to leave most of his army behind - to maintain control of his conquests.

Id: [0x00046577]
Interesting. And what of the Apple?

Id: [0x00046578]
It is either here in the city or with Cesare. If we can retrieve the artifact now, it will give us an advantage. And if it's with Cesare, he'll surely bring it back once we force him home.

Id: [0x00046579]
It is an indirect route you propose...

Id: [0x0004657A]
How else would a single man wage war against an army.

Id: [0x0004657B]
Strike smartly, Ezio, and you'll have your army soon enough.

Id: [0x0004657E]
????

Id: [0x0004657F]
With Rome firmly in his power, Cesare now leads men into Romagna, hoping to conquer the countryside - and in time, all of Italia (Italy).

Id: [0x00046580]
We will stop him.

Id: [0x00046581]
Of course. But how? Our loss at Monteriggioni has cost us - not only in terms of manpower, but influence as well. Those we once considered allies now cower. They will not fight.

Id: [0x00046582]
Nor need they. Not yet, at least.

Id: [0x00046583]
What do you suggest?

Id: [0x00046584]

Id: [0x00046585]
Interesting. And what of the Apple?

Id: [0x00046586]
It is either here in the city or with Cesare. If we can retrieve the artifact now, it will give us an advantage. And if it's with Cesare, he'll surely bring it back once we force him home.

Id: [0x00046588]
How else would a single man wage war against an army.

Id: [0x00046589]
Strike smartly, Ezio, and you'll have your army soon enough.

Id: [0x0004658C]
Locked.

Id: [0x0004658D]
BLAH BLAH

Id: [0x0004658E]
BLAH BLAH

Id: [0x00046590]
(Shit!)

Id: [0x00046592]
Hmmm. This shouldn't be here.

Id: [0x00046594]
You make a very good maid.

Id: [0x00046595]
(Fuck you.)

Id: [0x00046596]
[Laughs]

Id: [0x00046598]
You're right... let it be someone else's problem. Come on.

Id: [0x0004659D]
Ezio! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0004659F]
Machiavelli told me of your predicament.

Id: [0x000465A0]
That's surprising. Empathy isn't his strong suit.

Id: [0x000465A1]
He also suggested I leave you behind.

Id: [0x000465A2]
Ah. Now that's more like him.

Id: [0x000465A3]
I won't do it, though.

Id: [0x000465A4]
I appreciate the sentiment, but he's right. You've a more important job to do here.

Id: [0x000465A5]
I found the room where the Apple's kept.

Id: [0x000465A6]
Let me guess. The door's locked. Lucrezia has the key.

Id: [0x000465A7]
I'm not leaving you here.

Id: [0x000465A9]
We should be safe here.

Id: [0x000465AB]
(My hero.) Thank you, Ezio.

Id: [0x000465AD]
I'm just glad you're safe.

Id: [0x000465AF]
I fear none of us are truly safe now. Cesare has taken the Apple with him to Romagna.

Id: [0x000465B0]
Yes. Do you know where it's kept?

Id: [0x000465B1]
It's somewhere in the city. Well guarded, to be sure.

Id: [0x000465B3]
How well guarded?

Id: [0x000465B5]
You don't stand a chance. Especially now that you've confirmed your presence in the city.

Id: [0x000465B6]
I agree. A direct assault would be difficult, given our current state.

Id: [0x000465B7]
Then change it.

Id: [0x000465B9]
We intend to.

Id: [0x000465BA]
Hello Machiavelli.

Id: [0x000465BB]
Always a pleasure, Signora.

Id: [0x000465BD]
Perhaps I can be of assistance in this. My time in the Castel was not entirely unproductive.

Id: [0x000465BE]
Do tell.

Id: [0x000465BF]
[instructions for weakening the Borgia and strengthening assassins.]

Id: [0x000465C1]
Ser Ezio, a pleasure.

Id: [0x000465C3]
Come in. Make yourselves at home.

Id: [0x000465C5]
You'll find no better a place to conduct your business in all of Roma. Some redecorating might be in order, but she's sturdy and secure.

Id: [0x000465C8]
Four walls and a roof is all we need. This will do.

Id: [0x000465C9]
For now.

Id: [0x000465CB]
Tell me what you've learned.

Id: [0x000465CD]
The Apple's being kept somewhere in the Holy See.

Id: [0x000465CE]
Any way to narrow it down?

Id: [0x000465CF]
Caterina Sforza might know.

Id: [0x000465D0]
What? She's in the city?

Id: [0x000465D1]
When Cesare's troops were finished with Monteriggioni they moved on to Romagna. Forli was the first to fall. Lady Sforza was taken captive and brought to Rome in chains.

Id: [0x000465D2]
Where is she being kept?

Id: [0x000465D3]
Castel Sant'Angelo.

Id: [0x000465D4]
Then that's where I will go.

Id: [0x000465D7]
Ser Ezio, a pleasure.

Id: [0x000465D9]
Come in. Make yourselves at home.

Id: [0x000465DB]
You'll find no better a place to conduct your business in all of Roma. Some redecorating might be in order, but she's sturdy and secure.

Id: [0x000465DE]
Four walls and a roof is all we need. This will do.

Id: [0x000465DF]
For now.

Id: [0x000465E1]
Tell me everything you know.

Id: [0x000465E3]
The Apple's being kept here - in Castel Sant'Angelo.

Id: [0x000465E4]
You know this how?

Id: [0x000465E5]
From Caterina Sforza.

Id: [0x000465E6]
What? She's in the city?

Id: [0x000465E7]
When Cesare's troops were finished with Monteriggioni they moved on to Romagna. Forli was the first to fall. Lady Sforza was taken captive and brought to Rome in chains.

Id: [0x000465E8]
Then I need to free her.

Id: [0x000465E9]
No. You need to retrieve the Apple.

Id: [0x000465EB]
I don't like this.

Id: [0x000465EC]
And I don't care. You have a job to do. You can play at hero all you like - ONCE we're done with this.

Id: [0x000465EE]
Stop sulking. It's unbecoming.

Id: [0x000465F0]
Do we know WHERE inside the Castel?

Id: [0x000465F2]
This map will lead the way.

Id: [0x000465F5]
Stay focused, Ezio - or we'll all be made to pay.

Id: [0x00046611]
Who is that?

Id: [0x00046612]
Cesare Borgia, Rodrigo's son.

Id: [0x00046613]
What does he want from us?

Id: [0x00046615]
You tell me, Ezio.

Id: [0x00046617]
Why now?

Id: [0x00046618]
Likely in response to your Roman indiscretions.

Id: [0x00046619]
Vengeance begets vengeance...

Id: [0x0004661A]
Only when you leave the other side with the means to respond.

Id: [0x0004661D]
Let's save this talk for another time. We've a city to defend.

Id: [0x00046620]
Ah, you must be Ezio Auditore.

Id: [0x00046621]
Hello Cesare.

Id: [0x00046622]
Surrender your forces and I will spare those who still survive.

Id: [0x00046623]
You speak as though you've won.

Id: [0x00046624]
But I have. Or are you blind?

Id: [0x00046625]
I still stand, which means you've not long to live.

Id: [0x00046626]
Bold words. Though after what I've done to your city, it seems you've little else to fight with.

Id: [0x00046628]
My bare hands are more than sufficient for the job.

Id: [0x00046629]
[Laugh]

Id: [0x0004662A]
Come, then. Let's see what you can do.

Id: [0x0004662F]
Cesare!

Id: [0x00046631]
I can blend in with the troops - make my way towards him - and deliver the killing blow.

Id: [0x00046632]
How?

Id: [0x00046634]
You've no hidden blade. Planning to choke the life from him? We saw how well that worked with Rodrigo.

Id: [0x00046636]
Besides, his men would cut you down before you had a chance to finish.

Id: [0x00046638]
I can't just let him go.

Id: [0x00046639]
You can. And you will. Be assured you'll have your day with him. But not until you're ready.

Id: [0x0004663A]
You forget your place, Machiavelli.

Id: [0x0004663B]
And you forget yours. Clouded by guilt over what's happened. Desperate to atone for your mistakes.

Id: [0x0004663D]
I want things set to right as much as you do. But you're no good to us enveloped by denial.

Id: [0x0004663F]
One day you'll thank me for being so direct.

Id: [0x00046640]
One day, perhaps, but not today.

Id: [0x00046648]
I assume you've come for this?

Id: [0x0004664A]
Well, you can't have it back.

Id: [0x0004664D]
Brother! The Assassin's made his way into-

Id: [0x0004664F]
YOU!

Id: [0x00046651]
Kill him!

Id: [0x00046653]
No, you fools! He'll escape! Jump down!

Id: [0x00046654]
But Madonna Lucrezia, it's...

Id: [0x00046655]
NOW!

Id: [0x00046658]
What are you waiting for?!

Id: [0x0004665B]
[Shriek]

Id: [0x0004665C]
Peace, sister. I'll deal with the Assassin.

Id: [0x0004665E]
What is this...?

Id: [0x0004665F]
Retribution.

Id: [0x00046661]
...killed us...

Id: [0x00046662]
...killed us...

Id: [0x00046663]
...killed us...

Id: [0x00046665]
You killed us!

Id: [0x00046667]
EZIO!

Id: [0x00046669]
We need to go!

Id: [0x0004666B]
There they are!

Id: [0x00046670]
Masetro Cesare, a pleasure.

Id: [0x00046671]
I am displeased.

Id: [0x00046675]
El Meyor.

Id: [0x00046676]
Ah! Cousin. I - I did not expect you back in Rome until at least next week.

Id: [0x00046678]
So it seems.

Id: [0x0004667A]
How may I be of service?

Id: [0x0004667C]
The Swiss have begun to grumble. Unable to sate themselves with the spoils of war, they turn to us for... additional compensation.

Id: [0x0004667D]
Ah, I see. Of course. I'll do anything I can. For us. For the cause.

Id: [0x0004667F]
Only...

Id: [0x00046681]
Only what.

Id: [0x00046682]
I've had trouble as of late exacting payment from many of the citizens. They beg poverty. Claim business is impacted by our... policies. And now that the Jubilee is finished, we no longer have pilgrims here to make up the difference.

Id: [0x00046683]
Speak with my father. See about removing more from the Papal apartments. There must be jewels, at least. Perhaps a painting or two.

Id: [0x00046684]
Oh, but the cardinals watch now. They've grown suspicious. Too much has been, uh, misplaced or lost.

Id: [0x00046685]
And this is my problem, why?

Id: [0x00046687]
Right, then. Understood. I'll see about raising district taxes or confiscating more property.

Id: [0x00046688]
Have you considered something more... politically correct?

Id: [0x00046689]
No. But... I could! Something like hosting an event? That could work... Yes! In fact, I think that's it!

Id: [0x0004668A]
Spit it out.

Id: [0x0004668B]
I've suddenly had the greatest idea! I'll put those slovenly (SOMETHING) to work. A party. At the Coliseum. To benefit the soldiers. And a passion play to cap it off! Stir their hearts and the purse strings will loosen.

Id: [0x0004668D]
I don't think anyone ever expects to wake up one morning and find themselves caught in the middle of a war between two secret organizations.

Id: [0x0004668E]
I know I didn't. But here I am.

Id: [0x0004668F]
On one side are the Templars, better known these days as Abstergo Industries. They're in the business of control. Politics. Economics. Technology. They won't stop until every single one of us serves them. Literally.

Id: [0x00046690]
Fighting against them are the Assassins, a group dedicated to safeguarding humanity's free will. I was born into the brotherhood.

Id: [0x00046691]
A couple of weeks ago the Templars found me. They took me prisoner. Strapped me into a machine they'd built and put me to work.

Id: [0x00046692]
It's called an Animus. And it's where I spent most of my time. Exploring the memories of my ancestors, discovering entire lives locked deep inside my DNA.

Id: [0x00046693]
First, I revisited the life of Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, an Assassin from the Crusades. The Templars wanted the location of something known as a Piece of Eden, an ancient artifact capable of bending people to their will.

Id: [0x00046694]
Once the Templars had what they were looking for, they decided my usefulness had come to an end. But Lucy saved me.

Id: [0x00046695]
Lucy. [beat] When things were at their worst, she revealed herself to be an Assassin and helped me escape.

Id: [0x00046696]
I was hoping that would be the end of my misadventures.

Id: [0x00046697]
But we were just getting started. Back into another Animus I went.

Id: [0x000466A0]
Something big is coming. Something bad.

Id: [0x000466A2]
My name is Desmond Miles and this is my story.

Id: [0x000466E2]
Better in the hands of the Earth, than in the hands of man.

Id: [0x000466EC]
Uncle?

Id: [0x000466EE]
What can I say? We sent a single man against an entire army. I was worried. Quick, climb up. We have to get out of here.

Id: [0x0004670E]
This decision is yours alone to make, only do so quickly.

Id: [0x00046715]
...and then Minerva talked about the sun. She told of a disaster that occurred long ago and another that is coming.

Id: [0x00046716]
Sometime far in the future, vero (right)? Then we need not worry about it.

Id: [0x00046717]
Sì. (Yes.) [beat] Perhaps our work is finished.

Id: [0x00046718]
Would that be so bad?

Id: [0x0004671F]
Brother!

Id: [0x00046721]
She's fine. I heard you were returning, but I am glad to see it with my own eyes. The Contessa (Countess) of Forlì is here to welcome you. I had no idea you were so famous!

Id: [0x00046722]
Gather the others in Mario's study tonight. I'll explain everything there.

Id: [0x00046724]
Steel yourself, Ezio. They will have many questions.

Id: [0x0004672B]
Though not, I think, as any of us expected.

Id: [0x00046746]
The Spaniard lives?!

Id: [0x00046748]
Once our enemies are dead we can speak of vaults and gods and ancient places. You should have killed him. We're sure to suffer for it.

Id: [0x0004674F]
It's the Borgia.

Id: [0x00046750]
How did we not see this?

Id: [0x00046751]
They must have massed to the East during the night. We need to hold them off until the townspeople have escaped.

Id: [0x0004676A]
I know you're there, Ezio. The Pope told me about you and your little group of Assassins...and this.

Id: [0x0004676E]
Basta! (Stop!) I can walk.

Id: [0x000468BC]
Salve, cittadini di Roma! (Hail citizens of Rome!) Behold a sight most splendid! Caterina Sforza, she-whore of Forlì - has at last been brought to heel!

Id: [0x000468BD]
Ha! No one kneels as low as Lucrezia Borgia! Who put you up to this? Was it your brother or your father? Perhaps a bit of both? Perhaps at the same time!

Id: [0x000468BF]
Chiudi la bocca! (Shut your mouth!) None speak ill of the Borgia!

Id: [0x000468C6]
You are here for Cesare and Rodrigo.

Id: [0x000468D0]
You're pathetic, Lucrezia.

Id: [0x000468DD]
Cesare.

Id: [0x000468DF]
That mouth on her...How I'd love to sew it shut.

Id: [0x000468E6]
Ezio Auditore da Firenze? [beat] How nice to finally meet after hearing so much. A pity Cesare is no longer here. He would have enjoyed this.

Id: [0x000468EB]
My fight is not with you, Lucrezia. Free Caterina and I will stand down.

Id: [0x000468EC]
Impossible.

Id: [0x0004691E]
Ezio.

Id: [0x00046937]
Good people of Roma (Rome), thank you all for joining me this evening. I have assembled you here that you might bear witness to a most wondrous feat of engineering. A discovery so grand, it guarantees to reshape the nature of combat completely.

Id: [0x00046939]
For centuries we have relied upon Rome's surest and strongest men in times of war. We've outfitted them in the finest armors - equipped them with the best weapons.

Id: [0x0004693A]
And yet - in spite of all these advances - these tools and training and talent - still they are men. Still they are mortal. Still, too often, they die.

Id: [0x0004693C]
But what if I could promise you an END! Hmm? An end to your uncertainty, your suffering. Your sleepless nights spent wondering: will the one I love return?

Id: [0x0004693D]
Behold the Harbinger!

Id: [0x00046940]
Bring out the test subjects!

Id: [0x000469CD]
You will go no further, Ezio.

Id: [0x000469CF]
What? You'll charm them? ALL of them? That artifact has power - but not so much as you believe.

Id: [0x000469D0]
Yield, Cesare. Submit yourself to me. Your tyranny is at an end.

Id: [0x000469D1]
I command an army! Ten thousand men obey my every word. No glamours necessary.

Id: [0x000469D3]
Behold!

Id: [0x000469D5]
10,000 ducats to the one who brings me his head.

Id: [0x000469D7]
What's wrong with you!? He's standing right there.

Id: [0x000469D9]
15,000 ducats, then!

Id: [0x000469DD]
Any entire army, was it? And not a single one will stand against me.

Id: [0x000469DF]
I command you to attack! Kill him! KILL HIM!!!

Id: [0x000469E2]
FINE! I'll do it MYSELF!

Id: [0x000469E4]
Cesare Borgia?

Id: [0x000469E6]
What do YOU want?

Id: [0x000469E8]
By order of Julius II, our most esteemed and beloved Pope, I hereby place you under arrest.

Id: [0x000469EA]
Is this some sort of joke?

Id: [0x000469EB]
No, Ser Cesare. I'm afraid it's nothing of the sort.

Id: [0x000469EC]
What is the charge?

Id: [0x000469ED]
They are myriad in their breadth and offense. You will answer for them all before (His Holiness).

Id: [0x000469EE]
Well played, Ezio!

Id: [0x000469F0]
But it won't do you any good. I'll be done with this business before the sun has set. And then I'll come for you. A hundred men will follow. No. A thousand! They shall put your world to TORCH! You and all you love! I crushed your brotherhood once! I'll do it all a second time!

Id: [0x000469F2]
Do you hear me, Assassin?! I'll come for you! I'LL COME FOR YOU!!!

Id: [0x000469F4]
His Holiness wishes to speak with you as well.

Id: [0x000469F5]
Where?

Id: [0x000469F6]
[[GO TO LOCATION HERE]]

Id: [0x000469F9]
Ezio.

Id: [0x000469FA]
We have a problem.

Id: [0x000469FB]
Yes. We know of Cesare's arrest. But -

Id: [0x000469FC]
Where is he being held? I'll finish him inside his cell.

Id: [0x000469FD]
It will be harder than you think. Or at least more... circuitous.

Id: [0x000469FE]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000469FF]
His sentence is to be carried out in Spain.

Id: [0x00046A00]
Then I must strike before he departs.

Id: [0x00046A01]
And that's the trouble. He already has.

Id: [0x00046A02]
Julius is swift...

Id: [0x00046A03]
As a leader should be. Already he works to repair relations with the Orsini and Colonna families.

Id: [0x00046A04]
I've been invited to the Vatican. And not to stand trial, for once.

Id: [0x00046A05]
Is Julius an ally, then?

Id: [0x00046A06]
No. But not an enemy either. I think things will be more stable under him, though I doubt we'll agree with all he plans.

Id: [0x00046A07]
Status quo is it?

Id: [0x00046A08]
After all that has transpired, I'd consider status quo a pleasant state of affairs.

Id: [0x00046A09]
And you, Ezio?

Id: [0x00046A0A]
I follow Cesare - to Spain.

Id: [0x00046A10]
The throne was mine!

Id: [0x00046A38]
In the beginning, we set our truths to parchment. To stone. To the memory of men. These proved impermanent things. Cleansed by fire. Cleansed by famine. Cleansed by flood. All the world is innocent once more. Innocent and ignorant.

Id: [0x00046A39]
They build temples to us. They should build libraries. They record miracles. They should record truths. They listen to our stories. They should listen to our lessons. They are afraid. We are afraid for them.

Id: [0x00046A3A]
We did not build them to be wise. And now they are our final, faulted hope. You are they.

Id: [0x00046A3B]
You possess the potential for understanding. But you broke our tools. Or turned them against one another. We have destroyed what we could. Sealed away what we could not.

Id: [0x00046A3C]
Most. Not all. And it does not take many to unwind the world.

Id: [0x00046A3D]
Here is a safe place. Eternal. To store objects. Words. Wisdom. But not life. Almost did we have the means. But time...time erodes us.

Id: [0x00046A3E]
A hundred years I might speak and still you would not know us. You with five senses. Us with six. The one we kept from you. To be safe. Now, you can never know. Only try. Grasp. You can SEE. SMELL. TASTE. TOUCH. HEAR. Knowledge has been locked away.

Id: [0x00046A3F]
After, when the world became undone, we tried to pass it through the blood. Tried to join you to us. You see the blue shimmer. You hear the words. But you do not know.

Id: [0x00046A41]
WE SHOULD HAVE LEFT YOU AS YOU WERE!

Id: [0x00046A47]
It is hard to stay contained. Knowing as we do. We wait for you, Desmond. You will come here. You will activate it. You will know only when it is too late.

Id: [0x00046A5B]
I know this. I know that symbol. That's a Phrygian Cap. It stands for freedom...and that, that's a Masonic eye. Now those two come together in only one place--

Id: [0x00046A69]
Tonight, I dare make that promise.

Id: [0x00046A6C]
Assume your positions!

Id: [0x00046A6E]
I said assume your positions!!

Id: [0x00046A70]
The Harbinger possesses a diverse arsenal, capable of adapting to the often uncertain and rigorous landscape of the battlefield.

Id: [0x00046A72]
It excels at ranged combat -

Id: [0x00046A74]
When surrounded, it can fire a dozen miniature cannons simultaneously.

Id: [0x00046A76]
In the unlikely event the enemy is able to reach the Harbinger, they will find it impervious to all known weapons.

Id: [0x00046A78]
Attack the Harbinger.

Id: [0x00046A7A]
[Dramatic sigh] My apologies.

Id: [0x00046A7C]
Attack the Harbinger or join your friend.

Id: [0x00046A7E]
Witness its fortitude! Swords, arrows, stones, bullets - all are deflected. Nothing can breach her armor.

Id: [0x00046A80]
But should the enemy not realize its mistake in approaching, she holds a final surprise.

Id: [0x00046A82]
Ladies and Gentlemen - The Harbinger.

Id: [0x00046A85]
Grazie. Grazie. (Thank you. Thank you.)

Id: [0x00046A89]
He calls it a triumph. It's an abomination! You have to stop him, Ezio. You MUST!

Id: [0x00046A8B]
Only... There's something off about this. Archimedes is best known for his spectacular failures, not his mechanical genius. What's changed?

Id: [0x00046A90]
Let me worry about these things, friend. You should return to your workshop. It's dangerous here.

Id: [0x00046A92]
What are you going to do?

Id: [0x00046A95]
Put an end to this madman's tinkering.

Id: [0x00046A97]
Shit! There’s a roadblock up ahead. They must have known we’d go north.

Id: [0x00046A98]
Where exactly are we?

Id: [0x00046A99]
Check the map. Is there anywhere safe we can set up the equipment? A cave, anything.

Id: [0x00046A9A]
No, there’s nothing around here for -- Hello. Take E78.

Id: [0x00046A9B]
What —

Id: [0x00046A9C]
This exit. Turn!

Id: [0x00046A9D]
I hope you actually have a plan.

Id: [0x00046A9E]
Wait until you see where I’m taking you.

Id: [0x00046AA1]
Here?! This is where you want me to stop?

Id: [0x00046AA2]
Nothing quite like déjà vu now is there?

Id: [0x00046AA4]
The Villa Auditore?

Id: [0x00046AA5]
This isn’t a secure area. Vidic’s men will be able to find us easily.

Id: [0x00046AA6]
No they won’t. Come with me.

Id: [0x00046AA7]
So you figured it out, did you? Now she’ll take all the credit, of course.

Id: [0x00046AA9]
There’s a big stone blocking it on the inside. We’re not getting in this way.

Id: [0x00046AAB]
Any other ideas?

Id: [0x00046AAC]
The road just loops back into the highway, so this is not a good place for us to be right now. Do we have any camouflage gear in the van?

Id: [0x00046AAD]
I really hate to stress this, but we’re running out of time.

Id: [0x00046AAE]
Help us then, Shaun. Do you have any ideas?

Id: [0x00046AAF]
I don’t know, maybe there’s another way into the Sanctuary?

Id: [0x00046AB1]
Maybe we can find a way in through here?

Id: [0x00046AB2]
Yeah, okay, let’s give it a shot, there might be a way to reopen the entrance from the inside. Let’s hurry, though, we need to get the equipment out of sight as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00046AB3]
We’ll just wait up here then. Keep an eye out for snipers, Rebecca.

Id: [0x00046AB5]
Look at this place. I can almost feel Ezio beside me.

Id: [0x00046AB6]
Try to compartmentalize, Desmond. This is reality, not the Animus.

Id: [0x00046AB7]
Right. Let’s open that door.

Id: [0x00046AB9]
Yes! Great job, Desmond. Now, let’s get the Animus into the Sanctuary. Shaun, park the van in town and then get back here. Make sure you aren’t followed.

Id: [0x00046ABB]
What’s this?

Id: [0x00046ABC]
No idea. We’ll have Shaun analyze it when he gets back.

Id: [0x00046ABE]
Archimedes.

Id: [0x00046AC0]
W-what seems the be the trouble?

Id: [0x00046AC2]
Your war machines keep failing.

Id: [0x00046AC4]
Spectacularly.

Id: [0x00046AC5]
I-I there m-must be a m-mistake!

Id: [0x00046AC6]
A mistake, indeed. More of MY OWN MEN have fallen than the enemy. Are you, perhaps, trying to sabotage me?

Id: [0x00046AC7]
N-no. N-nothing of [gasp] sort. Please. I can explain. Only [gasp] put me down.

Id: [0x00046ACA]
You must understand that engineering demands precision. There's only so much I can do when denied my most critical resource...

Id: [0x00046ACB]
Are you asking me for more money?

Id: [0x00046ACC]
No, no. You misunderstand. It's not coin I lack, Cesare, but TIME.

Id: [0x00046AD0]
XXX

Id: [0x00046B17]
My god, my god, why hast thou thus forsaken me?

Id: [0x00046B19]
Hark, hark how he cryeth upon Elijah to deliver him.

Id: [0x00046B1A]
Wait and we shall see whether Elijah dare come here or not.

Id: [0x00046B1B]
My thirst is great, my thirst is great.

Id: [0x00046B1C]
Yea, thou shalt drink no more.

Id: [0x00046B1D]
Mighty God in majesty, to work thy will I will never cease. My spirit I betake to thee; receive it, lord, into thy hands. 'Consummatum est.'

Id: [0x00046B1E]
Lords, I say you, this was God’s son almighty. I know it must be so. I know by manner of his cry he has fulfilled the prophecy and godhead showed in him.

Id: [0x00046B1F]
Centurion, as God gives me speed, thou must be daft; thou cannot read. When thou seest his heart bleed, let us see what thou will say. Now, Longyus, take this spear in hand.

Id: [0x00046B20]
Yes, have this spear and take good heed. Thou must do, as the bishop bade thee, a thing that is full of great need.

Id: [0x00046B21]
I will do as he bade me, but on your peril it shall be. What I do I may not see, whether it be evil or good.

Id: [0x00046B27]
Hold! Who goes there? State your business.

Id: [0x00046B28]
My name is Ezio Auditore. I seek an audience with your master.

Id: [0x00046B29]
He's otherwise occupied. Go away.

Id: [0x00046B2A]
No.

Id: [0x00046B2B]
Then you'll die.

Id: [0x00046B2D]
Ne tirez pas! (Hold your fire!)

Id: [0x00046B30]
What is it you want, stranger?

Id: [0x00046B31]
To negotiate the terms of your surrender.

Id: [0x00046B33]
This meeting is over, then.

Id: [0x00046B34]
I would advise against that.

Id: [0x00046B37]
Or what?

Id: [0x00046B38]
All who serve Cesare must be brought to justice.

Id: [0x00046B3A]
Very well. But be quick. I've work to do.

Id: [0x00046B3C]
This hardly seems a fair fight.

Id: [0x00046B3D]
Agreed.

Id: [0x00046B3F]
You don't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00046B44]
Au revoir. (Goodbye.)

Id: [0x00046B49]
I apologize for the meager accommodations, but you didn't give us much notice.

Id: [0x00046B4B]
Fear not, though! You won't be a guest for very long.

Id: [0x00046B4D]
Cesare is returning from Romagna. He's asked I keep you alive. For what purpose, I do not know.

Id: [0x00046B4F]
But I'd prepare for the worst, if I were you.

Id: [0x00046B51]
Octavien?

Id: [0x00046B52]
Mmmm?

Id: [0x00046B54]
It's not yet too late for you to flee. Remain, however, and I will kill you.

Id: [0x00046B56]
On peut toujours rêver. (Good luck with that.)

Id: [0x00046B59]
Hellooooo?

Id: [0x00046B5B]
Ah! I bring the prisoner his meal, yes?

Id: [0x00046B5D]
Is okay?

Id: [0x00046B5F]
(What the hell?)

Id: [0x00046B60]
Oops.

Id: [0x00046B62]
Bartolomeo?!

Id: [0x00046B63]
This time, I rescue you!

Id: [0x00046B65]
Now, shall we commence with the killing?

Id: [0x00046B67]
I need my equipment first.

Id: [0x00046B68]
Of course! Follow me!

Id: [0x00046B6A]
I can't make sense of it, Ezio. Best you hear it yourself.

Id: [0x00046B6D]
Grazie, Ser...

Id: [0x00046B6E]
Ezio.

Id: [0x00046B6F]
I am sorry to have made them call you. But I did not know where else to turn.

Id: [0x00046B70]
Tell me of your trouble.

Id: [0x00046B71]
They hired us to dig in the forest. The (Forum of Augustus.) They wanted the marble and bronze. Greedy bastards. Taking what is not theirs. From the start, I knew something was wrong...

Id: [0x00046B73]
It was a Temple to Mars. We should have left it alone. Ah, but we didn't. And now... now they are free!

Id: [0x00046B74]
Who is free?

Id: [0x00046B75]
I know that what I saw should not exist, and yet it does! You must believe me!

Id: [0x00046B76]
Out with it then.

Id: [0x00046B77]
Lupi mannari. (Werewolves.)

Id: [0x00046B79]
I knew it! You think me mad. And I don't blame you. Time was, I'd have thought the same. But I know what I saw.

Id: [0x00046B7B]
You called me here for this?

Id: [0x00046B7C]
He represents the builders... Help him, and I can ensure we'll win the support of the masons, carpenters, and others.

Id: [0x00046B7D]
So now I play at politician.

Id: [0x00046B7E]
But you've always been one, Ezio - like it or not.

Id: [0x00046B80]
Va bene. I'll check out this Forum of yours - see what really haunts the woods.

Id: [0x00046B83]
It is a good thing we do. A disappearance here. An unsolved killing there. A severed limb discarded in the street. A headless corpse pulled from the Tiber. Small things. But effective. The people... they imagine the worst, saving us from having to perform it.

Id: [0x00046B84]
What sort of god do your worship that you would murder innocents for no other reason than to instill a sense of fear?

Id: [0x00046B86]
No gods. Only Cesare. The temple to Mars - the stories of Romulus and Remus - distractions. Decorations, really - to give our tale some spice. But all fake.

Id: [0x00046B88]
These blades of mine, however, are very very real.

Id: [0x00046B89]
Why has he asked you to do this?

Id: [0x00046B8A]
Two eyes fixed upon the woods are two less eyes to fix upon Cesare and his plots. The citizens are so busy cowering from my lupi mannari (werewolves) they lack the means to question my master's work.

Id: [0x00046B8B]
Once I've killed you, they'll no longer be distracted.

Id: [0x00046B8C]
Once you kill me... [laughs]

Id: [0x00046B8E]
How well do you know these woods, Assassin?

Id: [0x00046B8F]
What does it matter?

Id: [0x00046B91]
You'll see why, soon enough.

Id: [0x00046B94]
You're at a disadvantage...

Id: [0x00046BBF]
We should be safe here.

Id: [0x00046BC1]
(My hero.) Thank you, Ezio.

Id: [0x00046BC3]
No need.

Id: [0x00046BC5]
I assume you've come to Rome in search of the Apple?

Id: [0x00046BC6]
Yes. Do you know where it's kept?

Id: [0x00046BC7]
It's somewhere in the city. Well guarded, to be sure.

Id: [0x00046BC9]
How well guarded?

Id: [0x00046BCB]
You don't stand a chance. Especially now that you've confirmed your presence in the city.

Id: [0x00046BCC]
I agree. A direct assault would be difficult, given our current state.

Id: [0x00046BCD]
Then change it.

Id: [0x00046BCF]
We intend to.

Id: [0x00046BD0]
Hello Machiavelli.

Id: [0x00046BD1]
Always a pleasure, Signora.

Id: [0x00046BD3]
Perhaps I can be of assistance in this. My time in the Castel was not entirely unproductive.

Id: [0x00046BD4]
Do tell.

Id: [0x00046BD5]
Cesare has set three of his closest allies to govern Rome. Each has been given control of a district where they ensure an obedient populace and resources for his campaign.

Id: [0x00046BD6]
XXXX

Id: [0x00046BDC]
With Cesare gone to Urbino, we must build our forces.

Id: [0x00046BF8]
I rather like it open, myself.

Id: [0x00046BF9]
Lucrezia.

Id: [0x00046BFE]
No. Only...it gets quite lonely here. You and I spend so little time together these days, busy as you are with your OTHER conquests.

Id: [0x00046C03]
Soon, once I have secured the throne of Italia, you are going to be my queen, and your loneliness will be a thing of the past.

Id: [0x00046C04]
Oh. My back. Please, can you reach this water jug for me? I cannot get it myself.

Id: [0x00046C06]
Ezio, what are you doing here?

Id: [0x00046C21]
Did you know that before I'd even turned thirteen, plans were being made to wed me to a man I'd never met. I was to be prepared and traded like a bit of meat on the butcher's hook.

Id: [0x00046C22]
The way you might sharpen a knife, so my father sharpened me - my mind, my looks, my every move.

Id: [0x00046C23]
I took these gifts with grace. For though they would surely aid my father in his plans, so too might they aid me with mine.

Id: [0x00046C24]
I am sorry for your situation, Lucrezia. I know well the darkness that dwells within him. But do not let his misdeeds justify your own. It is too late, perhaps, for your father to change - but you are not beyond repair.

Id: [0x00046C25]
I cannot let her go! Don't you understand? It's her captivity that prevents mine! Let Cesare and father have her lands. Forli and Imola shall know peace and prosperity under them. And I might at last have the chance to live my life as I choose.

Id: [0x00046C26]
You trade her freedom for your own.

Id: [0x00046C27]
Yes.

Id: [0x00046C28]
An honest answer, at least. But it does not change the circumstances. You will let her go.

Id: [0x00046C2C]
Please. Continue. I did not mean to interrupt.

Id: [0x00046C2F]
I cannot leave you out here to cause trouble, so you're coming with me. Scream, however, and I will be forced to take your tongue.

Id: [0x00046C39]
Guards!

Id: [0x00046C61]
Salute Lucrezia! How I've missed you.

Id: [0x00046C62]
Vai a farti fottere, troia. (Go fuck yourself, whore.)

Id: [0x00046C63]
Always a pleasure. [to Ezio] Bring her here. I'll take the key.

Id: [0x00046C67]
GUARDS! GUARDS!

Id: [0x00046C79]
What about that one?

Id: [0x00046C7A]
Oh! She is beautiful...

Id: [0x00046C7B]
Okay! Then go talk to her?

Id: [0x00046C7C]
Just like that? Talk about what?

Id: [0x00046C7D]
It doesn't matter. See, little brother, most men are so afraid of beautiful girls, that anyone who actually talks to them has an advantage! Just make it up as you go.

Id: [0x00046C80]
What.

Id: [0x00046C81]
What?

Id: [0x00046C82]
Why are you just standing there?

Id: [0x00046C83]
Oh. Um... Because I... wanted to ask you something. Which is... What's your name?

Id: [0x00046C84]
Pft! Not one you'll ever need to make use of.

Id: [0x00046C86]
Aspetta! (Wait!) I wasn’t ready. I was planning on being really charming. And funny! Can I just have a second chance?

Id: [0x00046C8A]
Oh well...

Id: [0x00046C8B]
Ezio, all is not lost. You made her smile! She will remember you now.

Id: [0x00046C8C]
No, I can still fix this. I’ll follow her a ways, see where she lives.

Id: [0x00046C93]
I told you, I'm not interested.

Id: [0x00046C94]
Sì. (Yes.) But I am.

Id: [0x00046C95]
Get in line.

Id: [0x00046C96]
I think not, amore mio (my love). I've decided I'm tired of waiting for you to open your legs on your own.

Id: [0x00046C99]
Cane rognoso (Shabby dog)! What do you want here? This has nothing to do with you.

Id: [0x00046C9A]
Nice to see you too, Vieri. I think you're disturbing this young lady's day.

Id: [0x00046C9F]
Is that the best you can do?

Id: [0x00046CA0]
Shut your mouth. I'll kill you.

Id: [0x00046CA2]
Why am I not surprised to find you forcing yourself on a nice girl? Just like your father's bank treats Firenze.

Id: [0x00046CA3]
Fool. Your father is the one who needs to learn a lesson.

Id: [0x00046CA5]
You Pazzi are all mouth and no fist. You've been slandering my family's name around this town for too long!

Id: [0x00046CA6]
No more than they deserve.

Id: [0x00046CA8]
Come on then, hit me. Give me a reason to break your neck!

Id: [0x00046CAD]
You will pay for interfering. Your whole family will!

Id: [0x00046CB1]
Thank you. That was very kind of you.

Id: [0x00046CB3]
Are you alright?

Id: [0x00046CB4]
I am now... You asked for my name earlier. It's Cristina.

Id: [0x00046CB5]
Piacere (a pleasure), Cristina! I'm Ezio.

Id: [0x00046CB6]
Well, Ezio. Looks like you got yourself a second chance.

Id: [0x00046CBD]
Thank you for coming.

Id: [0x00046CBE]
Of course. Of course. Tell me, what can I do?

Id: [0x00046CBF]
My family's bodies... I can't just leave them hanging from the gallows! I need to give them last rites. Send them on to the next world...

Id: [0x00046CC0]
Capisco. (I Understand.) Lead the way, Ezio.

Id: [0x00046CC8]
They've already been cut down!

Id: [0x00046CC9]
What are we going to do?

Id: [0x00046CCA]
Hide yourself. I'm going to have a little talk with that guard.

Id: [0x00046CCD]
Where are the bodies that hung here!?

Id: [0x00046CCE]
They’ve already been taken!

Id: [0x00046CCF]
Where? Tell me where they are!

Id: [0x00046CD0]
I don't know! I think they were taking them down to the river to dump them.

Id: [0x00046CD1]
No...

Id: [0x00046CD5]
Cristina! Vieni con me! (Come with me!)

Id: [0x00046CDB]
What will you do?

Id: [0x00046CDC]
Only one thing to do. Kill them--

Id: [0x00046CDD]
No! Don't do that. They did nothing wrong--

Id: [0x00046CDE]
They follow orders unquestioningly. That makes them--

Id: [0x00046CDF]
Ezio!

Id: [0x00046CE1]
Va bene. (It's okay.) I'll sneak behind their backs. Get my family, one at a time if I have to, and carry them down to the river.

Id: [0x00046CE2]
Be careful.

Id: [0x00046CEE]
I have to leave the city... Cristina, I want you to come with me.

Id: [0x00046CF1]
I want to... But I can't... My family...

Id: [0x00046CF4]
So, we'll always be together, Cristina.

Id: [0x00046CF6]
Ezio...

Id: [0x00046CFE]
[GASP]Ezio! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x00046CFF]
I only just came back to Firenze... Look at you! As beautiful as ever.

Id: [0x00046D00]
But... Oh, Ezio... I... It's been two years!

Id: [0x00046D01]
And I've thought of nothing but you.

Id: [0x00046D02]
Oh, but, Ezio...

Id: [0x00046D03]
What is it?

Id: [0x00046D04]
I'm engaged to be married!

Id: [0x00046D06]
My father kept asking me to choose... I thought I would never see you again!

Id: [0x00046D0A]
It's Manfredo! He's going to kill him!

Id: [0x00046D0B]
What!?

Id: [0x00046D0C]
Un tale (Some guy) he lost money to! He's dragged him out to the end of the new bridge!

Id: [0x00046D0D]
Who the hell is Manfredo?

Id: [0x00046D0E]
My fiancé...

Id: [0x00046D13]
I'll pay you back, I swear!

Id: [0x00046D14]
It's too late for that now.

Id: [0x00046D15]
It wasn't my fault. I was going to have the money for you today... But a payment came in late!

Id: [0x00046D16]
I do not care about your troubles, only my money.

Id: [0x00046D17]
But I can pay you!

Id: [0x00046D18]
Now?

Id: [0x00046D19]
Tomorrow!

Id: [0x00046D1A]
You'll be dead tomorrow.

Id: [0x00046D1B]
Wait. Please. I'm about to be married.

Id: [0x00046D1C]
You should've thought of that before you started gambling.

Id: [0x00046D22]
Grazie, Messere! You don't know how close--

Id: [0x00046D24]
Whoa! Hey! Aspetta! (Wait!) What are you doing!?

Id: [0x00046D25]
Do you love her?

Id: [0x00046D26]
What!?

Id: [0x00046D27]
DO YOU LOVE HER? Cristina! The woman you're about to marry!

Id: [0x00046D28]
Yes! I do! I swear, I do. Kill me here and I will die still loving her.

Id: [0x00046D2A]
You are never going to gamble again.

Id: [0x00046D2B]
Never, Messere.

Id: [0x00046D2C]
You will be a good husband to her. Or I will hunt you down and kill you myself.

Id: [0x00046D36]
He's fine. He'll make a good husband. I made sure of it.

Id: [0x00046D37]
Wha-- What!?

Id: [0x00046D3E]
Ezio! I was hoping to see you tonight.

Id: [0x00046D3F]
I don't have much time. The Doge's party starts very soon.

Id: [0x00046D40]
Nevertheless, I have news. I hear Cristina Vespucci is in Venezia for Carnevale. Weren’t the two of you close?

Id: [0x00046D41]
Once...

Id: [0x00046D43]
Perhaps it would have been better not to tell you. She's with her husband. She may not be too happy to see you.

Id: [0x00046D44]
No... It's wonderful. It's Carnevale! With this mask, she need not even know it's me! I know just the way to draw her attention... Grazie, amico.

Id: [0x00046D48]
Cristina, my darling. I must have you alone. Meet me in the alley. Ti amo, amore mio. (I love you my love.])- Your husband.

Id: [0x00046D4C]
There... Now to await her at the rendezvous.

Id: [0x00046D55]
Cristina...

Id: [0x00046D56]
Manfredo! When did you get so romantic--

Id: [0x00046D57]
Sshhh...

Id: [0x00046D5B]
Mmmmmmmmmm....

Id: [0x00046D5D]
Ezio....?

Id: [0x00046D60]
What the hell are you doing here!? How dare you--?

Id: [0x00046D61]
Cristina... It's alright.

Id: [0x00046D62]
Alright!? I haven't seen you in eight years!

Id: [0x00046D63]
Sì... (Yes...) I was afraid you wouldn't come if I... just asked.

Id: [0x00046D64]
You're right. I wouldn't have! Ezio... The last time I saw you, you kissed me in an alley-- and then left me behind to be married!

Id: [0x00046D65]
It was the right thing to do. He loved you.

Id: [0x00046D66]
Who cares what he wanted!? -- I loved YOU.

Id: [0x00046D68]
You had your second chance... Please, Ezio... Don't ever find me again.

Id: [0x00046D70]
Manfredo!? What happened!?

Id: [0x00046D71]
Men... Savonarola's men... They came through, destroying everything...

Id: [0x00046D72]
Where is Cristina!? Manfredo! WHERE IS SHE?

Id: [0x00046D73]
She ran... They went after her!

Id: [0x00046D76]
No...!

Id: [0x00046D7B]
Whore! Where are your riches now?

Id: [0x00046D7D]
Your fancy house, your expensive dress! They are sins against the Lord!

Id: [0x00046D7F]
Leave me alone! Get away! I did nothing to you.

Id: [0x00046D81]
Savonarola will see all you sinners burn!

Id: [0x00046D83]
You should have submitted to Savonarola when you were told to!

Id: [0x00046D84]
Help me! Someone help!

Id: [0x00046D87]
Ezio--!?

Id: [0x00046D88]
Cristina! RUN!

Id: [0x00046D8B]
This is none of your business! Vattene! (Get lost!)

Id: [0x00046D92]
Cristina... Hold on! I'll get you to a doctor... You're going to be alright.

Id: [0x00046D93]
No... Ezio... I don't think I am...

Id: [0x00046D95]
No!

Id: [0x00046D97]
Don't... Don't go... Stay with me, Cristina.

Id: [0x00046D99]
Ezio... Don’t you know...? I've always been with you.

Id: [0x00046D9E]
I wish we... could have had... a second chance. [DIES WITH LAST BREATH]

Id: [0x00046DA0]
Requiescat in pace... (Rest in peace...) my love...

Id: [0x00046DA5]
(Help! Help!) He's trying to hurt me!

Id: [0x00046DA7]
What the hell are you doing?!

Id: [0x00046DA9]
Lay down your -

Id: [0x00046DAB]
Have you lost your mind?!

Id: [0x00046DAC]
I needed a weapon.

Id: [0x00046DAE]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x00046DB1]
Oh, classy.

Id: [0x00046DB6]
That's enough out of you!

Id: [0x00046DBF]
Can you walk?

Id: [0x00046DF4]
We can't hope to take him on directly - not with the resources he currently commands. So let us focus on our efforts on depriving him of the things that give him strength.

Id: [0x00046DF6]
We need to stop him.

Id: [0x00046DF7]
No. This is GOOD.

Id: [0x00046DF8]
Are you MAD?!

Id: [0x00046DF9]
Quite the opposite. Only listen and I'll explain:

Id: [0x00046DFA]
Cesare has set three of his closest allies to govern Rome. Each has been given control of a district where they ensure an obedient populace and resources for his campaign.

Id: [0x00046DFB]
We will stop him.

Id: [0x00046DFC]
Of course. But how? Our loss at Monteriggioni has cost us - not only in terms of manpower, but influence as well. Those we once considered allies now cower. They will not fight.

Id: [0x00046DFD]
Nor need they. Not yet, at least.

Id: [0x00046E0E]
Open her cell!

Id: [0x00046E13]
[Laugh] Have you talked to the Pope about the funds requested by my banker?

Id: [0x00046E14]
Oh?

Id: [0x00046E15]
Where to even begin...? Word reached me of Monteriggioni's sacking. I knew it was only a matter of time before the Borgia came knocking. And knock they did. With cannon fire and sell-swords.

Id: [0x00046E16]
Not one to shrink from a challenge, I turned my own artillery against theirs. But my subjects are sad little sheep - and prefer stability to freedom. They would not fight. Most abandoned me.

Id: [0x00046E17]
In my final moments, I tried to bring the city down. If I could not stop Cesare, I could at least deny him his prize.

Id: [0x00046E18]
You'd have destroyed Forli?

Id: [0x00046E19]
Its citizens possess neither loyalty nor principle. If they will not stand for something, better they not stand at all.

Id: [0x00046E1A]
Caterina...

Id: [0x00046E1C]
I've always shown respect for your opinions, Ezio. I ask you do the same for mine.

Id: [0x00046E1D]
As you wish.

Id: [0x00046E1E]
Once the city belonged to the Borgia, Cesare came for me. I'd have thrown myself from the ramparts were it not for my children. I could not bear the thought of leaving them behind.

Id: [0x00046E1F]
And so that is how I came to be his prisoner. Once the Borgia were content to marry us - now it's iron bars that they prefer.

Id: [0x00046E22]
Caterina. Did they...? Did Cesare...?

Id: [0x00046E23]
No. My name must still have some small value. I was left...unspoiled.

Id: [0x00046E27]
Look how they cheer for us! There are so many.

Id: [0x00046E28]
Please. This is not for me. They are welcoming you, my lord, to your new home.

Id: [0x00046E29]
Your modesty continues to baffle me! How lucky I am to have found such a friend among my enemies.

Id: [0x00046E2A]
Shh. My other friends will hear you and be jealous.

Id: [0x00046E2C]
I told you that you'd have more fun with me in Rome than in the countryside, my lord.

Id: [0x00046E2D]
Cesare, my friend, enlighten me, why do you insist on calling me lord when you have taken Faenza for yourself? It is you who is now lord.

Id: [0x00046E2E]
Ah, yes, thank you for reminding me, I had almost forgotten. Enough of lords. We are all compatriots here.

Id: [0x00046E33]
Let us escape this parade. Bring your brother, the young boy could use some exercise.

Id: [0x00046E34]
So, tell me, how do you inspire such loyalty in your men?

Id: [0x00046E35]
Exactly as you do, my friend, because we fight together for the freedom of our people. I would never risk their lives for anything less.

Id: [0x00046E36]
Of course. You send them to their death to ensure your freedom.

Id: [0x00046E37]
Well, no, more for OUR freedom.

Id: [0x00046E38]
How young you are. "Oh, to be young forever," isn't that what our parents always say?

Id: [0x00046E39]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x00046E3A]
You must come drink with me.

Id: [0x00046E3B]
I don't want to walk much further.

Id: [0x00046E3C]
We're almost there, Giovanni.

Id: [0x00046E3D]
We are so fortunate to have you as a protector. You're almost like his father.

Id: [0x00046E3E]
My father is dead.

Id: [0x00046E3F]
But his blood still flows in your veins. At least there's that to comfort you. Now, let's have some fun, Giovanni. I'll race you to the mid-section of that bridge!

Id: [0x00046E41]
He's going to win!

Id: [0x00046E42]
Don't you miss the power you once had when you were lord?

Id: [0x00046E43]
Not at all. My displacement brought peace to Faenza, what more could I wish for my people?

Id: [0x00046E44]
My lord mistakes naïveté for heroism.

Id: [0x00046E45]
Again with your modesty! You have ruled Faenza well these few months. Of course, I'll be watching to see how things turn out.

Id: [0x00046E48]
I win! I win!

Id: [0x00046E49]
Astorre, I have obviously failed in my duties as your mentor. You should have learned that without your people, you are nothing. Guards!

Id: [0x00046E4C]
I have to ensure I keep Faenza. You and your brother have a claim, I can't let you return to get in my way. You understand how it is.

Id: [0x00046E4D]
We trusted you as our friend.

Id: [0x00046E4E]
I have no friends.

Id: [0x00046E4F]
Why now? Why not before?

Id: [0x00046E50]
The people, for whatever reason, like you. I can't very well kill one of their heroes, can I? But, right now, in the back allies of Rome, I don't see anyone who wants to keep you alive.

Id: [0x00046E52]
And I always win.

Id: [0x00046E54]
Oh, you will?

Id: [0x00046E55]
If not as lord then as a champion of war.

Id: [0x00046E57]
We're here.

Id: [0x00046E5E]
See you inside...

Id: [0x00046E60]
Well this is weird.

Id: [0x00046E61]
Same place, different year.

Id: [0x00046E62]
Different century...

Id: [0x00046E64]
But why here?

Id: [0x00046E65]
I don't know what we did or didn't leave behind during the escape. Vidic might know the location of our other hideouts.

Id: [0x00046E66]
Okay, but that doesn't answer my question.

Id: [0x00046E67]
It's as safe a place as any. And I wanted to see if Ezio had left anything behind.

Id: [0x00046E68]
Like what?

Id: [0x00046E69]
I don't know...

Id: [0x00046E6B]
Please don't let there be bats. Please don't let there be bats...

Id: [0x00046E6F]
[whistle] They really built this place to last.

Id: [0x00046E70]
No signs of structural damage. It should be safe to set up in here.

Id: [0x00046E73]
Wait a second...

Id: [0x00046E75]
Desmond?

Id: [0x00046E76]
Try... Try turning the seals.

Id: [0x00046E78]
All of them.

Id: [0x00046E7A]
Well that was anti-climactic...

Id: [0x00046E7C]
You were saying?

Id: [0x00046E7D]
Whatever...

Id: [0x00046E80]
Goddam bats!

Id: [0x00046E82]
Rebecca - finish getting set up in here. Shaun - get the truck covered up and hidden. Desmond - you're coming with me.

Id: [0x00046E84]
Aw. I wanted to see what's down there.

Id: [0x00046E85]
I'll tell you what's down there: Years of neglect. It's a deathtrap.

Id: [0x00046E87]
Nice knowing you, Desmond.

Id: [0x00046E8A]
We should've brought flashlights.

Id: [0x00046E8B]
Hold on...

Id: [0x00046E8F]
It's incredible. These tiny pipes must be filled with natural gas. And the scones have flints in them. See these gears? The whole thing's automated.

Id: [0x00046E91]
I told you there'd be something here. Come on. Let's see where it leads.

Id: [0x00046E94]
Let me know if you see any more bats.

Id: [0x00046E95]
What's with you and bats?

Id: [0x00046E96]
Are you kidding? Rabies, for a start.

Id: [0x00046E97]
Statistically speaking it's EXTREMELY rare for a human to contract rabies from a bat.

Id: [0x00046E98]
But you admit it's possible! Also they seem to have a fondness for my face. And that screaming. No, shrieking. Horrible.

Id: [0x00046E99]
They're totally harmless, Desmond.

Id: [0x00046E9A]
It's a trick. They're trying to trick you. So you let your guard down. That's when they attack!

Id: [0x00046E9B]
Okay now you're just being crazy.

Id: [0x00046E9C]
Look - you don't have to believe me. Just be careful.

Id: [0x00046E9D]
[Laughs]

Id: [0x00046E9F]
So - we ever gonna talk about what happened with Minerva?

Id: [0x00046EA0]
Shaun is looking into it.

Id: [0x00046EA1]
Right. But that doesn't mean you can't have an opinion.

Id: [0x00046EA2]
Assuming anything at this point is counter-productive.

Id: [0x00046EA3]
How can you be so 'whatever' about everything?

Id: [0x00046EA4]
Well, what do you think?

Id: [0x00046EA5]
I think the Mayans knew. Twelve twenty-one twelve.

Id: [0x00046EA6]
I didn't see a calendar hanging in the air when Minerva gave her speech. Did you? That date is of dubious origin anyway - especially when it comes to the apocalypse.

Id: [0x00046EA7]
So you DO have an opinion! You think it's bullshit.

Id: [0x00046EA8]
I think it's more complicated than that. Look - I agree something tragic happened to the First Civilization.

Id: [0x00046EA9]
Understatement.

Id: [0x00046EAA]
I believe that whatever happened to them was related to an extra-terrestrial event.

Id: [0x00046EAB]
So you think Minerva's an alien?

Id: [0x00046EAC]
No. The sun is an extra-terrestrial object. So is a comet. They originate outside the borders of the Earth. If Minerva's people came from another planet, then sure - she'd be an extra-terrestrial. But I don't think that's the case. I think they're from here. They just came... before.

Id: [0x00046EAD]
You've got a real gift for that, you know?

Id: [0x00046EAE]
Gift for what?

Id: [0x00046EAF]
Saying a bunch of stuff without actually saying anything at all.

Id: [0x00046EB0]
I'm keeping an open mind, Desmond. That's all. We need more information.

Id: [0x00046EB1]
What if we don't have time for "more information"?

Id: [0x00046EB2]
Shaun's been checking NASA's data. Nothing strange going on with the sun. So hopefully if something does start up, we'll have some warning. Then again, I'm not sure that's where we should be looking.

Id: [0x00046EB3]
But Minerva -

Id: [0x00046EB4]
Minerva what? I saw the sun. Sure. And some flares. Which are normal. And she talked about the world burning. But it doesn't mean the two are connected - or connected in the way we think they are. I'm almost positive the sun isn't going to magically burn up the Earth. And it would be magical. Because it contradicts everything we've been taught by science.

Id: [0x00046EB5]
And science teaches us about some crazy first civilization with spandex jumpsuits and mind-control orbs?

Id: [0x00046EB6]
Point taken.

Id: [0x00046EB7]
Well, whatever it is, she said it would happen again.

Id: [0x00046EB8]
Yeah. That's the one thing we have to assume is true.

Id: [0x00046EB9]
So is there a plan?

Id: [0x00046EBA]
She told us to find the other vaults. And that's what we're going to do. As soon as Shaun's selected a candidate, we'll head there. Hopefully it'll contain the information we need.

Id: [0x00046EBB]
We've still got Abstergo and their satellite to worry about.

Id: [0x00046EBC]
We're working on that too.

Id: [0x00046EBD]
You've got it all covered, then.

Id: [0x00046EBE]
Not even close. But we're trying.

Id: [0x00046EC1]
Maybe you were right. They really cleaned this place out. [A beat] Well, it was worth a shot-

Id: [0x00046EC3]
He came back here.

Id: [0x00046EC4]
What?

Id: [0x00046EC5]
Ezio came back here. After the attack. Years after, I think.

Id: [0x00046EC8]
He looks so... old.

Id: [0x00046ECD]
Do you think there's something here?

Id: [0x00046ECE]
Don't know...

Id: [0x00046ECF]
What about using your eagle vision?

Id: [0x00046ED1]
Sum quod eris; fui quod es.

Id: [0x00046ED3]
As you are, I was. As I am, you will be.

Id: [0x00046ED4]
What do you see?

Id: [0x00046ED5]
He knew, Lucy... Or hoped. I think he left this for me. Maybe not me specifically - but someone down the line. He's trying to tell us something. It looks like... instructions.

Id: [0x00046ED7]
But for what?

Id: [0x00046ED9]
[Slight sound of pain]

Id: [0x00046EDA]
Maybe you should lie down for a bit.

Id: [0x00046EDC]
It's alright. I'm fine. We should get back to the others. The sooner we can figure out what happened to the Apple, the better.

Id: [0x00046EDD]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x00046EDE]
Yes. If anything changes, I'll tell you. I promise.

Id: [0x00046EE3]
How... How did you do that?

Id: [0x00046EE4]
We found another way out.

Id: [0x00046EE6]
Found a vending machine too.

Id: [0x00046EE8]
Diet? I don't appreciate the implication...

Id: [0x00046EEA]
Relax. That's all they had.

Id: [0x00046EEB]
If you don't want it, I'll take it.

Id: [0x00046EED]
No.

Id: [0x00046EEF]
So! Let's hear it! What was down there?

Id: [0x00046EF0]
Not much. A message from Ezio, maybe. But I don't know what it means.

Id: [0x00046EF1]
Show me.

Id: [0x00046EF3]
Ah. I see.

Id: [0x00046EF4]
What is it?

Id: [0x00046EF5]
A big bunch of nothing.

Id: [0x00046EF6]
Do me a favor - hold onto it. Just in case.

Id: [0x00046EF7]
Fine. Now, if the two of you are finished with your little game of do-nothing, we can resume.

Id: [0x00046EF8]
Take a seat when you're ready, Desmond.

Id: [0x00046F0E]
There’s a beam blocking it from the inside. We’re not getting in this way.

Id: [0x00046F10]
What’s our next move?

Id: [0x00046F11]
The road just loops back into the highway. This is not a good place for us to be right now.

Id: [0x00046F12]
Do we have any tarps? We need to cover up the van.

Id: [0x00046F13]
I really hate to stress this, yeah, but we are running out of time.

Id: [0x00046F14]
Well help us then, Shaun. Do you have any ideas?

Id: [0x00046F15]
I don’t know, maybe there’s another way into the Sanctuary?

Id: [0x00046F19]
We’ll just wait up here then shall we...yeah? All alone, with massive targets painted on our backs.

Id: [0x00046F26]
They escaped through here.

Id: [0x00046F27]
What?

Id: [0x00046F28]
Ezio and the villagers. After the attack. I can see them now.

Id: [0x00046F29]
I know it’s difficult, but try to compartmentalize, Desmond. Focus on the present.

Id: [0x00046F4B]
Wow...

Id: [0x00046F4D]
He looks so... old. Ezio must have come back here way after the attack. But, why?

Id: [0x00046F4F]
Desmond!

Id: [0x00046F50]
Right. Let's open that door.

Id: [0x00046F5D]
Maybe you should lie down for a bit.

Id: [0x00046F5F]
Nah, it's all right. I'm fine.

Id: [0x00046FB2]
How many other Vaults, I wonder... And what dwells within them?

Id: [0x00046FB4]
Did you see her as well?

Id: [0x00046FB6]
The staff.

Id: [0x00046FB9]
(What the hell?)

Id: [0x00046FBB]
Better in the hands of the Earth, than in the hands of man.

Id: [0x00046FC3]
Ezio! Careful with that thing.

Id: [0x00046FC5]
Uncle? What are you doing here?

Id: [0x00046FC7]
We'd sent a single man against an entire army. I was worried.

Id: [0x00046FC8]
As you can see, all is well.

Id: [0x00046FCA]
And now?

Id: [0x00046FCC]
(Let's go.)

Id: [0x00046FD0]
You wouldn't believe the things I've seen.

Id: [0x00046FD1]
Stay alive then so that I might hear of them.

Id: [0x00046FD3]
What are you doing?!

Id: [0x00046FD4]
Saving you, from the look of things.

Id: [0x00046FD6]
Not bad for an old man.

Id: [0x00046FD7]
Agreed. You've still some skill.

Id: [0x00046FD8]
Ehi! (Hey!)

Id: [0x00046FDA]
Did he beg forgiveness in the end? Make excuses? Promise power in return?

Id: [0x00046FDB]
No. None of these things.

Id: [0x00046FDC]
I'm surprised he remained so composed.

Id: [0x00046FDD]
I let the Spaniard live, uncle.

Id: [0x00046FDE]
What?!

Id: [0x00046FDF]
Now is not the best time for explanations.

Id: [0x00046FE0]
Oh, Ezio... What have you done?

Id: [0x00046FE7]
This decision is yours alone to make.

Id: [0x00046FE9]
Only do so quickly. We haven't much time.

Id: [0x00046FEB]
(Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing?! Those are my horses! Thieves! Guards! Guards!)

Id: [0x00046FEE]
...and then Minerva simply disappeared. I cannot explain it. She was there - and yet she wasn't. Appearing like a painting, but in three dimensions - and capable of speech.

Id: [0x00046FEF]
It is a strange story you tell...

Id: [0x00046FF0]
Do you disbelieve?

Id: [0x00046FF1]
No, no. Nothing of the sort. Our history is filled with such oddities. Like the Apple of Eden you carry. Hmmm. It too has shown us movable paintings, has it not? Perhaps it holds the answer?

Id: [0x00046FF2]
I shouldn't - Not until we know the cost. Altair warned of the risks.

Id: [0x00046FF3]
And then proceeded to use it.

Id: [0x00046FF4]
Uncle...

Id: [0x00046FF5]
Then tell me, nipote (nephew):  Why did you not throw it into the river?

Id: [0x00046FF6]
I...

Id: [0x00046FF8]
Brother!

Id: [0x00046FFA]
I had heard you were returning, but I am glad to know it with my eyes. Is it finished, then? Is the Spaniard truly dead?

Id: [0x00046FFB]
We ride for the Villa. Gather the others. I'll explain everything there.

Id: [0x00046FFD]
Steel yourself, Ezio. They will have many questions. And I fear Machiavelli will be none too pleased...

Id: [0x00047002]
It is done.

Id: [0x00047004]
Though not, I think, as any of us expected.

Id: [0x00047006]
A few days ago I left for Rome. My mission was to slay Rodrigo Borgia,  leader of the Templars, and now Pope as well.

Id: [0x00047008]
In this, my friends, I failed.

Id: [0x0004700A]
I tried. Twice, in fact. The first time I had conviction, but he was too strong. The second time his strength had waned, but so had my resolve.

Id: [0x0004700C]
I cannot say for certain why I spared him. Only that I did. And that doing so felt right.

Id: [0x0004700E]
But this is neither the end of my tale, nor its most important part.

Id: [0x00047011]
Beneath the Vatican lay the vault we sought. And within it a message left by a people long gone from this world. All I say now is uncertain, but I'll share it nonetheless.

Id: [0x00047013]
They were mortal - like you and I. But far wiser. More powerful.

Id: [0x00047016]
She said they made us - though I know not how. As to why - It seems we were meant to serve.

Id: [0x00047018]
The Apple. The Papal Staff. They belonged to these ancient people.

Id: [0x0004701A]
What I saw and heard cast a cloud of doubt over everything I once believed true. What is our place in things? Our purpose? All is unclear to me now.

Id: [0x0004701D]
But in spite of this, I am hopeful. I believe that together we can find a way to understand.

Id: [0x0004701F]
The Spaniard lives?!

Id: [0x00047020]
After all I've shared with you, Machiavelli, THIS is what you wonder?

Id: [0x00047021]
Speak all you want of vaults and gods and ancient places. Do you think our enemy does the same? You should have killed him, Ezio, as you were meant to do. And now we're sure to suffer for it.

Id: [0x00047028]
It's the Borgia...

Id: [0x00047029]
How did we not see this?

Id: [0x0004702A]
They must have massed to the East...

Id: [0x0004702B]
Surely our scouts would have noticed such a thing.

Id: [0x0004702D]
What if we've been betrayed?

Id: [0x0004702E]
No. Impossible.

Id: [0x00047030]
Is it?

Id: [0x00047031]
It doesn't matter now. But once this battle's won, I intend to look into it.

Id: [0x00047033]
Uncle! Take the Apple and hide it!

Id: [0x00047035]
Niccolo, you must bring those who cannot fight to safety.

Id: [0x00047036]
Where do you suggest?

Id: [0x00047037]
To [LOCATION TBD].

Id: [0x00047038]
And what of you?

Id: [0x00047039]
I'll take to the cannons - see if I can't buy us all some time.

Id: [0x0004703A]
Aim true, Ezio. The Borgia must not be allowed to breach the walls!

Id: [0x0004703F]
Uncle!

Id: [0x00047041]
Ser Ezio! The [evacuation location TBD] is under attack! You must help us!

Id: [0x00047043]
Show me where. Quickly.

Id: [0x00047047]
Are you alright?

Id: [0x00047049]
I... think so.

Id: [0x0004704A]
Good. Take mother and go with the others. I'll make sure you aren't followed.

Id: [0x0004704C]
Come with us, son.

Id: [0x0004704D]
I'll be right behind you, madre (mother).

Id: [0x00047053]
I am sorry, nipote...

Id: [0x00047054]
What happened here?

Id: [0x00047055]
I killed a dozen of his men, but in the end, he proved stronger.

Id: [0x00047056]
No...

Id: [0x00047057]
Cesare has the Apple.

Id: [0x00047059]
You must get it back.

Id: [0x0004705B]
Uncle? Uncle!

Id: [0x0004705D]
We're here.

Id: [0x0004705F]
Ezio! What are you doing?

Id: [0x00047060]
We have no time for this!

Id: [0x00047061]
Sbrigati! (Hurry!) The guards will be here soon!

Id: [0x00047062]
Move quickly, Ezio, or I'll be forced to leave you behind!

Id: [0x00047066]
Assassini! (Assassins!) God will see you pay for your crimes!

Id: [0x0004709A]
What if I can't stop the visions? How long before I start painting symbols on the walls?

Id: [0x0004709B]
Don't joke about that. Sixteen is dead. We're focusing on the present, okay?

Id: [0x000470A5]
Okay. Everything's good here. Shaun, hide the van in town. And make sure you aren't followed.

Id: [0x000470A6]
What...what is that smell?

Id: [0x000470AC]
Yes! It's booted. We're good to go.

Id: [0x000470AD]
Let's get started.

Id: [0x000470AF]
Get in the Animus, Desmond.

Id: [0x000470B6]
Hey wassa-matta-you, Altair?

Id: [0x000470B7]
That's racist.

Id: [0x000470B8]
You're racist.

Id: [0x000470B9]
Really? This is what you guys are doing?

Id: [0x000470BA]
Oh no! God forbid I take a break. I've only spent the past three fucking weeks inside that machine.

Id: [0x000470BB]
No, no, you're right. Let's all just screw around while the world falls to pieces.

Id: [0x000470BC]
Hey, this isn't easy, you know.

Id: [0x000470BD]
Right. Like we're all on vacation out here?

Id: [0x000470BE]
Enough! Look... Everyone's under a lot of pressure. But we're the only ones who can stop Abstergo. So we need to keep it together.

Id: [0x000470BF]
She's right. We need to be a hive mind people.

Id: [0x000470C3]
(Hold.) These men have done no wrong.

Id: [0x000470C4]
They'll alert the guards.

Id: [0x000470C5]
Not necessarily.

Id: [0x000470C9]
What's happened here?

Id: [0x000470CA]
I remember a flash of light... and then... nothing.

Id: [0x000470CB]
Something terrible has happened, I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x000470CC]
Let us give thanks to God, then, that we have both been spared.

Id: [0x000470CE]
Where is (the pope)?

Id: [0x000470CF]
And the one who attacked him?

Id: [0x000470D0]
Both vanished now...

Id: [0x000470D1]
Perhaps we should leave as well.

Id: [0x000470D2]
Agreed. Only give me a moment... I am still unsteady on my feet.

Id: [0x000470D4]
This is what transpires when men place material gain over the needs of the faith.

Id: [0x000470D5]
You think it divine retribution?

Id: [0x000470D6]
What other explanation is there?

Id: [0x000470D7]
We stood idly by as that man did as he wished with the world... Are we also damned?

Id: [0x000470D8]
We must repent.

Id: [0x000470D9]
I only hope it's not too late.

Id: [0x000470F2]
Ah! It's been too long since I've had a chance to swing a sword. I am happy for the opportunity!

Id: [0x000470F3]
It sits ill with me that death defines us.

Id: [0x000470F4]
Listen to you. The murderer with a heart.

Id: [0x000470F5]
You mock me for valuing their lives?

Id: [0x000470F6]
And why not? Do you think they value yours?

Id: [0x00047122]
Stop wasting time, Ezio, and get up here!

Id: [0x00047123]
What are you doing? We need to go!

Id: [0x00047124]
Now is not the time for sightseeing!

Id: [0x00047125]
Our time would be better spent escaping this place.

Id: [0x00047133]
We upgraded the arsenal while you were away.

Id: [0x00047134]
Ah. And it is now customary for you to fire cannon balls at visitors?

Id: [0x00047135]
My apologies. We only installed them a few days ago. My men are still being trained in their use.

Id: [0x00047141]
I am not here to debate the past. Together, we should discuss the future.

Id: [0x0004714F]
Welcome home.

Id: [0x0004715F]
Who goes there?

Id: [0x00047161]
Salve (Hello) to you too.

Id: [0x00047163]
Ezio! I was expecting my wife.

Id: [0x00047164]
Somehow, that does not surprise me.

Id: [0x00047165]
The French puttane (whores) have us under pressure.

Id: [0x00047166]
It's only a matter of time before I have Valois by the throat. We have them in retreat.

Id: [0x00047168]
They seem to be getting closer.

Id: [0x00047169]
The situation is under control--

Id: [0x0004716F]
Bene. (Good.) So maybe I could use a little help.

Id: [0x00047173]
Tell me about their general, this Baron de Valois?

Id: [0x00047174]
Cesare persuaded King Louis to lend him an entire army to defeat me. I'm flattered.

Id: [0x00047175]
Where can I find him?

Id: [0x00047178]
Bonjour, général d'Alviano. Êtes-vous prêt à vous rendre? (Are you ready to surrender?)

Id: [0x00047179]
Why don't you come closer and say that?

Id: [0x0004717A]
You must learn how to speak French. It would mask your barbaric sensibilities.

Id: [0x0004717B]
As amusing as this parley has been, I'd like your unconditional surrender before sunrise.

Id: [0x0004717C]
Perhaps you could teach me, and I would instruct you in fighting, since you seem to do so little of it!

Id: [0x0004717D]
Hah! My lady Bianca will whisper it in your ear.

Id: [0x0004717E]
And practice your French. Soon all of Italie will be speaking it.

Id: [0x0004717F]
I believe another lady might object to that.

Id: [0x00047181]
Mio marito vi ammazzerà tutti! (My husband is going to murder all of you!)

Id: [0x00047182]
I'll kill you, fottuto francese (you French fuck)!

Id: [0x00047183]
Calm down, for your wife's sake. You know my terms: Enter my camp unarmed at dawn.

Id: [0x00047197]
Once inside, your men can overpower the camp's patrols, correct?

Id: [0x00047198]
Yes, but--

Id: [0x00047199]
Then we need to liberate several suits of French armor. At dawn, we are going to walk right in.

Id: [0x0004719A]
Hah! Ezio Auditore you are truly a man after my own heart. [Short laugh] Magnifico! (Magnificent!)

Id: [0x0004719D]
You steal a man's wife and then go hide inside a fortress?

Id: [0x000471A2]
We've had too much bloodshed, I think a cleansing is in order. So, consider this an invitation, from my family...

Id: [0x000471A4]
...to yours.

Id: [0x000471AF]
[Sigh of satisfaction] Ready to go again?

Id: [0x000471B0]
[Very short laugh] You don't need to ask.

Id: [0x000471B3]
One should always have the freedom to choose.

Id: [0x000471B4]
Merda! (Shit!) I have to find Mario and rally the troops.

Id: [0x000471B7]
My men are in the courtyard. I aim to lead them around back and flank our attackers.

Id: [0x000471B8]
Stay out of sight.

Id: [0x000471C1]
I will take care of it.

Id: [0x000471C2]
Use the cannons above the ramparts. I intend to lead a frontal assault.

Id: [0x000471C5]
Do you have it?

Id: [0x000471C6]
I am keeping it safe. [beat] The Borgia must not be allowed to breach the walls until everyone is safely away.

Id: [0x000471CA]
Insieme per la vittoria! (We stand together!)

Id: [0x000471CC]
Insieme! (Together!)

Id: [0x000471CD]
My children. Where are my children?!

Id: [0x000471CE]
Get your things and go!

Id: [0x000471CF]
My leg!

Id: [0x000471D0]
Where are we going?!

Id: [0x000471D1]
My mother. I Can't find my mother.

Id: [0x000471D4]
Signor Auditore, thank God! We must hold them back until the villagers escape!

Id: [0x000471D8]
They're coming from the left!

Id: [0x000471D9]
The left! The left!

Id: [0x000471DA]
Pivot to the left, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000471DC]
Incoming troops on the right!

Id: [0x000471DD]
Vi prego, mio Signore (Please, Sir), aim the cannon to the right!

Id: [0x000471DE]
I can see troops to the right!

Id: [0x000471E0]
They're coming from the other side!

Id: [0x000471E1]
Signore (Sir), aim the other way!

Id: [0x000471E2]
Other way!

Id: [0x000471E4]
Man the next cannon, Signore (Sir), they're coming from the other side!

Id: [0x000471E5]
They are within range of the other cannon!

Id: [0x000471E6]
The other cannon, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000471E8]
Ignore the battering rams!

Id: [0x000471E9]
Hit the siege towers, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000471EA]
Aim for the cannons!

Id: [0x000471EC]
They're destroying us! Pater noster, qui es in coelis, sanctificètur nomen tuum. (Father of ours, who are in heaven, blessed be your name.)

Id: [0x000471ED]
We have lost everything!

Id: [0x000471EE]
Please, save us, Signore (Sir).

Id: [0x000471F0]
Magnifico! (Magnificent!) You're beating them, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000471F2]
You have saved them! Wait. Soldiers are climbing the walls. Signore (Sir), forget the cannons. You must stop them!

Id: [0x000471F4]
They're breaching the gate!

Id: [0x00047201]
You hear their screams Valois? We are coming for you next.

Id: [0x00047213]
Bring me a suit of that perverted armor.

Id: [0x00047214]
You are not wearing one.

Id: [0x00047215]
What?

Id: [0x00047216]
It is part of the plan. You surrendered to us. We are bringing you to the Baron.

Id: [0x00047217]
Ah, yes. [Beat] Then what?

Id: [0x00047218]
Your men attack on my signal.

Id: [0x0004721D]
Your plan is brillante (brilliant), but I don't like using this kind of trick. I believe in fair fighting, may the best man win.

Id: [0x0004721E]
Cesare and the Baron seem to have a different style.

Id: [0x0004721F]
"There will come a day in which men no longer cheat each other. And on that day we will see what mankind is truly capable of."

Id: [0x00047220]
I've heard that before...

Id: [0x00047221]
It is something your father once wrote.

Id: [0x00047224]
Que venez-vous faire ici? (Declare yourself.)

Id: [0x00047226]
Mes soldats conduisent le capitaine italien à Son Excellence le Baron. Il veut se rendre. (My soldiers are taking the Italian captain to His Excellency the Baron. He wants to surrender.)

Id: [0x00047229]
You speak French?

Id: [0x0004722A]
[Clears throat] There were a couple of French girls in Firenze. [Short laugh]

Id: [0x00047231]
Général d'Alviano. It seems that you have seen the light.

Id: [0x00047235]
Shhh. What's that?

Id: [0x00047236]
Probably just training exercises.

Id: [0x0004723D]
Aiuto! Aiuto! (Help me! Help me!)

Id: [0x0004723E]
Water. Water. Everything is burning!

Id: [0x0004723F]
Oh God. Where are you, Marcello?!

Id: [0x00047241]
Run! Run!

Id: [0x00047247]
Help! Help! Please, help!

Id: [0x00047248]
Load the cannon.

Id: [0x0004724A]
Reload! Reload! Aahhh!

Id: [0x0004724C]
He's dead, Signore! (Sir)

Id: [0x0004724D]
Keep loading the cannon.

Id: [0x0004725C]
Kill him! Kill the assassin! Tear the maldito bastardo (old fucker) to pieces!

Id: [0x00047266]
Run to the hills. Run for your lives!

Id: [0x00047267]
Drop everything. Run!

Id: [0x00047268]
Come on, Mea, move faster!

Id: [0x00047269]
I can't find Tiziano!

Id: [0x0004726A]
A sinistra! (On the left!) Shoot to the left!

Id: [0x0004726B]
A destra! (On the right!) Shoot to the right!

Id: [0x0004726D]
Nearly half the townspeople have made it out!

Id: [0x0004726F]
Some townspeople still haven't escaped! Keep going!

Id: [0x00047271]
Almost all the townspeople are outside the walls!

Id: [0x00047272]
You must fire at them, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x00047273]
If they breach the walls, all our people will die. My family will die.

Id: [0x00047274]
Go! I will carry on here!

Id: [0x00047276]
Fire at them!

Id: [0x00047277]
Aim carefully, we can't withstand this attack much longer!

Id: [0x0004727A]
She was beautiful.

Id: [0x0004727B]
She was...until that porco (pig) defiled her. I wish he'd just killed her. I wish he'd just killed la mia amata (my beloved)!

Id: [0x0004727D]
People who saw her grow up cheered when he spat on her! Smiles on their faces when her neck...

Id: [0x0004727E]
I understand.

Id: [0x0004727F]
How can you? My Livia was innocent!

Id: [0x00047280]
I have lost family to the rope...to treachery.

Id: [0x00047282]
Il Carnefice watches from his home on the hill above. He threatens to hang me if I cut her rope.

Id: [0x00047283]
When you are ready, take her down. I will deal with Il Carnefice.

Id: [0x00047288]
Not my best, but it's hard to make art with poor materials.

Id: [0x0004728D]
Nice work down there.

Id: [0x0004728E]
Careful...I have fallen from my share of rooftops.

Id: [0x0004728F]
I'm waiting for my Lanz.

Id: [0x00047291]
He left me after our baby died. Joined up with the Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) gang.

Id: [0x00047293]
They say he kills now...pushes men from buildings! I tell them I don't believe it...

Id: [0x00047294]
But you do.

Id: [0x00047295]
I do.

Id: [0x00047296]
What will you say to him if he comes?

Id: [0x00047297]
I will jump.

Id: [0x00047298]
Why should you pay for his crimes?

Id: [0x00047299]
My death will remind him of the man he once was.

Id: [0x0004729C]
He does not deserve your sacrifice. Where is Lanz?

Id: [0x0004729D]
Up here...somewhere.

Id: [0x0004729E]
He will trouble you no more, Madonna (Madame).

Id: [0x000472A2]
Aim for the cannons, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472A3]
Destroy their cannons, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472A4]
They're preparing to fire on the left!

Id: [0x000472A5]
They're arming cannons on the left!

Id: [0x000472A6]
Watch out for the cannons on the right!

Id: [0x000472A7]
I see cannons to the right, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472A9]
The cannons will destroy us Signore (Sir), not the foot soldiers!

Id: [0x000472AA]
If the battering rams breach our gates, the fight will be lost!

Id: [0x000472AB]
Shoot the cannons, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472AC]
Aim for the battering rams, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472AE]
Archers below!

Id: [0x000472AF]
They've sent in archers!

Id: [0x000472B0]
Soldiers are coming!

Id: [0x000472B1]
Troops below!

Id: [0x000472B2]
Now there are men on horseback!

Id: [0x000472B3]
They've sent in the cavalry!

Id: [0x000472B4]
Aim for the horsemen, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472B5]
Hit the archers, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472B6]
Aim for the soldiers, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x000472B7]
Merda! (Shit!)

Id: [0x000472BB]
Who did this?

Id: [0x000472BC]
That monster, Malfatto!

Id: [0x000472BD]
Did you see him?

Id: [0x000472C1]
That way!

Id: [0x000472C3]
No... no... [SOBS]

Id: [0x000472C8]
Oh, Mina. I told you not to come out here...

Id: [0x000472CA]
Animale! (Animal!)

Id: [0x000472CC]
You didn't think this through!

Id: [0x000472CD]
Tell me if you need to rest. [Laugh]

Id: [0x000472CF]
Ha! Good! Good!

Id: [0x000472D0]
You've tasted blood before!

Id: [0x000472D2]
Madonna [Madame]...

Id: [0x000472D3]
Don't! Hasn't he hurt me enough?

Id: [0x000472D4]
I will not touch you. What happened here?

Id: [0x000472DF]
The Borgia have given it to him.

Id: [0x000472E0]
Auguste. My beloved husband. He believes he owns this neighborhood.

Id: [0x000472E1]
He once made signs for the shops in the district, but now he posts lies for the Borgia and hurts those who stand in his way.

Id: [0x000472E2]
Like you.

Id: [0x000472E3]
He spends his days locked in his workshop, but I may know how to goad him out...

Id: [0x000472E4]
How?

Id: [0x000472E5]
Tear down the signs he has posted throughout the district. His pride won't stand for it!

Id: [0x000472E6]
Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x000472EC]
Enough of your crap. Release my wife.

Id: [0x000472ED]
Such entitlement from a man born with nothing to his name.

Id: [0x000472F2]
Mine is worth its currency. Unlike yours, which is counterfeit.

Id: [0x000472FF]
Who has been tearing down my signs?

Id: [0x00047305]
Give, and it shall be given to you. For whatever measure you deal out to others, it will be dealt to you in return. These are insightful words ... words to live by, yet Brother Ristoro spits at them! Deus omnia videt[God sees everything].

Id: [0x00047306]
We Minims require your donations to survive. In return, we offer you knowledge. A fair trade, but one of us takes advantage! He abuses the trust we have worked so hard to establish!

Id: [0x00047307]
Come and see where your donations have gone! Two of our order slain by their own teacher! Ristoro's innocence bought from the Borgia!

Id: [0x00047308]
God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Ristoro is far from humble! He has broken his vow of poverty! Soiled every promise of purity! He must be held accountable! Deus omnes vel absolvit vel judicat [God absolves or condemns everyone]!

Id: [0x0004730D]
How were these men killed?

Id: [0x0004730E]
They questioned Brother Ristoro's habits, and now here they are, poisoned.

Id: [0x0004730F]
You question him as well. Why don't you fear his wrath?

Id: [0x00047310]
A man with nothing, fears nothing. I have remained true to my vows; I put my fate in the hands of the divine. Deus auscultat [God listens].

Id: [0x00047313]
Your vows keep you from acting, so you seek another to do what you will not.

Id: [0x00047314]
Please understand, I cannot kill.

Id: [0x00047316]
But I can. Where is Ristoro?

Id: [0x00047317]
He will be at the church, but guards always accompany him.

Id: [0x00047318]
The Borgia cannot protect him from me.

Id: [0x00047321]
Assassino! [Assassin!] He's here! Aiuto! [Help me!]

Id: [0x00047322]
No! No!

Id: [0x00047329]
This was your stand?

Id: [0x0004732A]
Sì (Yes). Everything has been broken.

Id: [0x0004732B]
Who did this?

Id: [0x0004732C]
Donato Mancini. I rode against his horse in the races and made the mistake of winning.

Id: [0x0004732E]
You, though, everyone is talking about you! How you fight against the Borgia's men. Donato has demanded I meet him alone, I fear he intends to kill me.

Id: [0x00047331]
Where can I find him?

Id: [0x00047333]
Grazie a Dio! (Thank God!) He is waiting at the Circo Massimo (Circus Maximus). That's where they hold their private races.

Id: [0x00047336]
Where is Rocco?

Id: [0x0004733E]
Stand still!

Id: [0x0004733F]
Come closer!

Id: [0x00047340]
Yaaah!

Id: [0x00047342]
How DARE you?

Id: [0x00047344]
I fear I misjudged you!

Id: [0x00047345]
Let's finish this!

Id: [0x0004734A]
Get down! He is still out there!

Id: [0x0004734C]
Who?

Id: [0x0004734D]
One of Borgia's dogs! We tried to build a resistenza (resistance). He came to our house and began firing his arquebus! My poor little Anna, she's...I've got to get back!

Id: [0x0004734E]
Just one shooter. He will be easy to overtake. He cannot be very accurate--

Id: [0x00047350]
Merda! (Shit!)

Id: [0x00047351]
He will kill us if we stay here! Listen, I will run to the next pillar to draw his fire. Try to flank him!

Id: [0x00047354]
Adesso basta! (Enough of this!)

Id: [0x00047359]
I see you, rat!

Id: [0x0004735C]
Come out and we can talk like gentlemen!

Id: [0x0004735D]
I can keep this up all day! Can you?

Id: [0x0004735E]
Stop wasting my time!

Id: [0x00047360]
Yes...come closer!

Id: [0x00047361]
I don't scare easily!

Id: [0x00047362]
You're making this simple!

Id: [0x00047364]
Why won't you die!?

Id: [0x00047365]
It's impossible!

Id: [0x00047366]
Merde, merde, merde! [Shit, shit, shit!]

Id: [0x00047368]
A hit!

Id: [0x0004736A]
Please don't call the guards. She would have wanted her burial here.

Id: [0x0004736B]
Your wife?

Id: [0x0004736C]
She was to be my wife...

Id: [0x0004736D]
Leave before you are seen here.

Id: [0x0004736E]
In the Colonna, she had a shop. The Borgia moved into the district and my wife refused to close.

Id: [0x00047372]
They found Monica with two thrown knives in her back.

Id: [0x00047374]
Do you know the killer?

Id: [0x00047375]
I heard of a woman who takes contracts for Cesare located near the antique baths.

Id: [0x00047397]
Stop!

Id: [0x0004739C]
Stop chasing me!

Id: [0x0004739E]
Vattene via! [Back off!]

Id: [0x0004739F]
Figlio di troia! [Son of a bitch!] Who sent you?

Id: [0x000473CA]
We must ensure the kidnappings continue.

Id: [0x000473CD]
Surrender and you will live!

Id: [0x000473CE]
Get in behind him!

Id: [0x000473CF]
Careful, this one bites!

Id: [0x000473D3]
No!

Id: [0x000473DC]
It is done. The message is delivered. We are gone now from this world. All of us. We can do no more. The rest is up to you, Desmond.

Id: [0x000473DE]
What? Who is Desmond? I don’t understand... Please, wait! I have so many questions!

Id: [0x000473DF]
Uh, Rebecca? What's going on...

Id: [0x000473F8]
Uh, which limb shall I take first, huh? Maybe I will start with that pretty head?

Id: [0x00047408]
Up here?

Id: [0x00047410]
I have to run some diagnostics, I'll get back to you.

Id: [0x00047415]
P.O.E.? Could one of you tell me what's going on?

Id: [0x00047426]
Highlight Sequence 2 for me, Desmond.

Id: [0x00047438]
You condemn what you do not understand.

Id: [0x00047439]
His is the voice of the devil!

Id: [0x0004743A]
Turn away from them!

Id: [0x00047443]
You would not believe the things I have seen, Mario.

Id: [0x00047444]
Then be sure to stay alive, that I might hear of them.

Id: [0x00047447]
I expect opposition.

Id: [0x00047448]
And I expect the Borgia to mourn the loss of many lives tonight.

Id: [0x0004745B]
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

Id: [0x0004745D]
Be ready to fight.

Id: [0x00047461]
What are you doing?!

Id: [0x00047462]
Saving you, from the look of things.

Id: [0x00047465]
[Short laugh] Not bad for an old man.

Id: [0x00047466]
Agreed. You still have some skill.

Id: [0x00047467]
Buona questa. (Good one.)

Id: [0x0004746A]
Excellent!

Id: [0x0004746E]
Impressive!

Id: [0x000474AC]
To the river!

Id: [0x000474AD]
Here! Climb on, Ezio.

Id: [0x000474AF]
Enough delaying, Ezio! Get on the horse!

Id: [0x000474B5]
No. I am leaving immediately for Roma.

Id: [0x000474B7]
Caterina? Here?

Id: [0x000474B8]
Is it finished, then? Is the Spaniard truly dead?

Id: [0x000474BF]
Give it to me. You can do with it as you will later.

Id: [0x000474C1]
Bene. (Good.)

Id: [0x000474D6]
Look out! They are coming! Everyone retreat to the Villa!

Id: [0x000474DC]
[Wincing] I cannot fight like this.

Id: [0x000474F8]
Mario is dead. You must leave this place. Take mother to Firenze.

Id: [0x000474FF]
Get me a horse.

Id: [0x00047501]
To Roma.

Id: [0x00047502]
You are not coming with us? Where are you riding?

Id: [0x00047511]
Buongiorno (Hello) Ezio.

Id: [0x00047512]
Caterina. To what do I owe the pleasure of your presence here?

Id: [0x00047513]
I desire...an allegiance. The papal armies have resumed their march on Forlì. Your mercenaries would be a great asset to my cause.

Id: [0x00047514]
It is likely that I can give you what you seek. But we will talk later.

Id: [0x0004751A]
Then you shall have it.

Id: [0x0004751E]
As you may have noticed in the van, I've made some improvements to the Animus and I've also patched in a new V.R. training program.

Id: [0x00047520]
Here you can show off all those flashy moves you picked up from your ancestors. Let me open one of the missions.

Id: [0x00047523]
You can access more V.R. missions through the Animus Desktop. As you complete training sessions, I'll add additional challenges.

Id: [0x0004752C]
But what if there are memories I just want to forget?

Id: [0x00047533]
Salta su (Jump on), get on the horse!

Id: [0x00047535]
Cosa diavolo aspetti? (What the fuck are you waiting for?) Get on the horse.

Id: [0x00047537]
Calmatevi (Calm down). The pain will end soon.

Id: [0x0004753B]
Where have you brought me?

Id: [0x0004753C]
Nowhere, Messere (Mister). A man left you here.

Id: [0x0004753E]
Did he say anything?

Id: [0x0004753F]
Only this. You are to meet Messer (Mister) Machiavelli in front of the Mausoleo di Augusto. Let me help you get dressed.

Id: [0x00047542]
Unfortunately, you cannot see it from here.

Id: [0x00047544]
Ah, Roma.

Id: [0x00047545]
Yes, or what is left of it since the Borgia came to power.

Id: [0x00047548]
I am so very sorry, Ezio.

Id: [0x00047549]
As am I. I had hoped the fight was finished.

Id: [0x0004754A]
I fear you wage a war that will never end.

Id: [0x0004754B]
Which makes me wonder, what point is there is to any of this.

Id: [0x0004754C]
The road you tread is long and hard - with little chance for rest. But surely you realized this when you took up your father's mantle?

Id: [0x0004754D]
It seems I did not...

Id: [0x0004754F]
Please. It's part of our very nature to doubt. It sharpens our convictions, reaffirms our beliefs. You've waded through worse and come out stronger. I've no doubt you'll do it again.

Id: [0x00047551]
But what if I don't want to, Leonardo? What if I've had enough.

Id: [0x00047552]
Oh, my friend, I fear that choice is no longer yours to make.

Id: [0x00047554]
Besides, you've too much heart to turn away. Too many depend on you.

Id: [0x00047557]
As always, you speak plain and true, Leonardo. Thank you.

Id: [0x00047558]
And now that you've been set back to right, I must return to Milano (Milan). The French are on the march and I'd like to quit the city before they've arrived.

Id: [0x00047559]
Consider Rome. I expect I'll be there for quite a while.

Id: [0x0004755A]
Hmmm. Yes. Perhaps I will!

Id: [0x0004767B]
Bene. (Okay.) Now you can survive the journey back to Firenze.

Id: [0x0004767C]
Perhaps. But I am not going to Firenze.

Id: [0x0004767D]
Oh?

Id: [0x0004767E]
There will be no peace until we rise up against the entire Borgia family and the Templars who serve them.

Id: [0x00047681]
As Cesare's conquests in Romagna continue to succeed and the Borgia grow in power they have taken desirable areas of the city for themselves. We cannot use the stables here.

Id: [0x00047682]
Oh, the will of the Borgia is law now?

Id: [0x00047683]
What are you implying Ezio?

Id: [0x0004768B]
Give me the gun his friend fashioned for us.

Id: [0x000476AE]
Do you have some kind of plan?

Id: [0x000476B2]
You excel at opening wounds, Ezio, but can you also close them?

Id: [0x000476B3]
I intend to heal the sickness, not treat its symptoms.

Id: [0x000476B4]
Stop sparring with me.

Id: [0x000476B5]
Fine. Let us talk openly then. Rodrigo Borgia's death would not have solved anything.

Id: [0x000476B6]
I am inclined to disagree.

Id: [0x000476B7]
Look at this city, the center of Borgia and Templar rule.  Killing one man will not change things. We need to take away the source of their power.

Id: [0x000476B8]
Relying on the people is like building on the sand.

Id: [0x000476B9]
You are wrong. Our belief in humanity rests at the heart of the Assassin brotherhood.

Id: [0x000476BB]
He must be from your inner circle. Go. Get back what he has stolen.

Id: [0x000476C2]
Did you liberate your money from our friend?

Id: [0x000476C5]
A small victory.

Id: [0x000476C6]
They add up. And in time, with work, we'll have a few dozen more.

Id: [0x000476CD]
And in time, Cesare's gaze will return to us and we'll be broken again. Now, where is my contact, Vinicio? He should have already intercepted the letter. Follow me.

Id: [0x000476D0]
He is ambitious, ruthless and cruel beyond imagining, the laws of men mean nothing to him. He murdered his own brother to take power.

Id: [0x000476D1]
Is that admiration I hear in your voice?

Id: [0x000476D2]
He knows how to exercise his will. A rare virtue in the world today.

Id: [0x000476D4]
What does he intend to do with his power? What drives the man? That I still do not know. But, Ezio, Cesare has set his sights on all of Italia, and at this rate he will have it.

Id: [0x000476D5]
When did you become so cynical?

Id: [0x000476D6]
I merely describe the reality of Roma today. But all may not be lost. The good news is that we have allies in the city. How much longer this will last, however, I cannot say.

Id: [0x000476D8]
He was attempting to steal official Vatican mail.

Id: [0x000476D9]
Who are you working for, ladro (thief)?

Id: [0x000476DA]
Then no one will care what we do to you.

Id: [0x000476DB]
Perdonatemi, Signore (Pardon me, Sir) You must be mistaken.

Id: [0x000476DC]
I am working for no one.

Id: [0x000476DF]
We have to save him, we need information he carries.

Id: [0x000476E1]
Grazie! (Thank you!)

Id: [0x000476E2]
Where is it?

Id: [0x000476E3]
The courier still has the letter.

Id: [0x000476E5]
Ezio, stop him!

Id: [0x000476F8]
This band of false-pagans has been terrorizing the city for months and driving the people into the arms of the Church.

Id: [0x000476F9]
Quite convenient.

Id: [0x000476FA]
Exactly! I believe the Borgia are supporting them, but proof remains scarce. That is why the letter is so important.

Id: [0x000476FB]
Here it is. I hope you can break a cipher.

Id: [0x000476FC]
Cazzo (Fuck), another encryption!

Id: [0x000476FF]
Sometimes logic is not the only way to win a war. Andiamo! (Come on!) You said we had allies in this city, bring me to them.

Id: [0x00047701]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00047703]
Do you want to come with me or not?

Id: [0x00047704]
We are going in this direction.

Id: [0x00047705]
Your senseless meandering will drive me mad.

Id: [0x00047708]
We recently began travelling through the tunnels to avoid the guards, but many of the entrances in the city are broken.

Id: [0x0004770A]
We cannot afford to delay.

Id: [0x0004772C]
Ben trovato (Hello), Niccolò!

Id: [0x00047730]
Ah! Ser (Sir) Ezio, a pleasure.

Id: [0x00047732]
Fabio Orsini, at your service. I've heard a great deal about you from my cousin - Bartolomeo D'Alviano.

Id: [0x00047734]
A fine warrior.

Id: [0x00047747]
Fabio has lent us an unused storeroom on Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island).

Id: [0x0004774B]
It is perfect.

Id: [0x0004774C]
I know you were used to better accommodations in Toscana--

Id: [0x0004774F]
Oh, you think we are ready for such an attack?

Id: [0x00047750]
What?

Id: [0x00047751]
Are you also unaware that the Borgia have captured the Apple of Eden?

Id: [0x00047752]
How could we have lost the Apple?

Id: [0x00047754]
So, you do not know what goes on with our enemies. Do we at least have an underground here to work with?

Id: [0x00047756]
Hardly. Our mercenaries are ensnared in a losing battle with Cesare's French allies.

Id: [0x00047758]
We have girls working for us in a brothel frequented by cardinals and other important Romans, but the Madame there is lazy and would rather attend parties than further our cause.

Id: [0x00047759]
What about the city's thieves? Do they have a guild?

Id: [0x0004775A]
Sì (Yes), but they refuse to talk to us. I don't know why.

Id: [0x0004775D]
What are you going to do?

Id: [0x0004775E]
Make some friends.

Id: [0x00047767]
Ezio Auditore! [Short laugh] Come in, come in. I'll kill you if you don't. [Laugh]

Id: [0x0004776B]
Bartolomeo!

Id: [0x0004776D]
Wait here. You have to meet my wife.

Id: [0x0004776E]
Did you check behind the table?

Id: [0x0004777A]
Charmed. Truly.

Id: [0x0004777B]
Now, we talk about war.

Id: [0x0004777C]
How goes the fight against the French?

Id: [0x0004777D]
Bene. (Good.) My men are holding their own.

Id: [0x0004777E]
Machiavelli seemed to think things were more difficult.

Id: [0x0004777F]
You know Machiavelli. He--

Id: [0x00047781]
Abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto! (We need your help!)

Id: [0x00047782]
Scusatemi. (Excuse me.)

Id: [0x00047784]
Ezio. Let me get straight to the point. The fight is not going well. We have been attacked on both sides, Borgia on one, French on the other. But know this: the Borgia position is weak. If you can defeat them, we can concentrate our forces on the French front.

Id: [0x00047785]
Ahhh. Here she is!

Id: [0x00047786]
I think I know a way to help. Thank you for disclosing this to me Madonna (Madame) d'Alviano.

Id: [0x00047787]
It is the least a wife can do to help her husband.

Id: [0x0004778F]
Ezio. We sent those luridi codardi (fucking cowards) running for the hills!

Id: [0x00047794]
Now that the Pope's dogs have fled, I will be able to draw more men to the fight. But first, I want to reinforce our barracks.

Id: [0x00047795]
Who will take care of this?

Id: [0x00047796]
I'm no good with these things. You are the educated one, you approve the plans!

Id: [0x0004779C]
Welcome to the Rosa in Fiore (Blooming Rose), stranger.

Id: [0x0004779D]
Salve (Hello). Would you be kind enough to call the owner for me?

Id: [0x0004779E]
Madonna Solari is not in.

Id: [0x0004779F]
Do you know where she is?

Id: [0x000477A0]
I--

Id: [0x000477A2]
Aiuto! Aiuto! (Help! Help!) Madonna Solari--

Id: [0x000477A3]
Lucia, We thought you were gone for good!

Id: [0x000477A5]
The men took us on a ship. They released me, but she--

Id: [0x000477A6]
Who took you on a ship?

Id: [0x000477A7]
Slave traders Messere (Mister). Near Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island). They want coin in exchange for her life.

Id: [0x000477A9]
I will get her back.

Id: [0x000477AF]
Are you here for the whore?

Id: [0x000477B0]
I have your money.

Id: [0x000477B1]
Aiutatemi! (Help me!)

Id: [0x000477B4]
No, take it up with Cesare.

Id: [0x000477C6]
Do not come any closer. He will kill her if I do not see the money.

Id: [0x000477C7]
Do not test me, I will do it!

Id: [0x000477C8]
No one gets near this boat unless you want this puttana (whore) to die.

Id: [0x000477C9]
Where is Madonna Solari?

Id: [0x000477CC]
Mother? Sister?

Id: [0x000477CD]
Ezio. Ser (Sir) Machiavelli said that you might be here.

Id: [0x000477CE]
What are you doing in Roma? Has Firenze been attacked?

Id: [0x000477CF]
No. Or, rather, I do not know. We did not go to Firenze.

Id: [0x000477D0]
She's dead.

Id: [0x000477D1]
Merda. (Shit.)

Id: [0x000477D2]
What now?

Id: [0x000477D3]
Will we have to close?

Id: [0x000477D4]
You cannot close. I need your help.

Id: [0x000477D5]
Messere (Mister), without someone who can run things, we are finished.

Id: [0x000477D6]
I'll do it.

Id: [0x000477D7]
You do not belong here, Claudia.

Id: [0x000477DB]
I know how to run a business. I ran Uncle Mario's for years.

Id: [0x000477DC]
You do this Claudia and you are on your own.

Id: [0x000477DD]
I've been on my own for twenty years.

Id: [0x000477DE]
Fine.

Id: [0x000477E0]
I intend to repair the brothel. This place is a real mess.

Id: [0x00047805]
Why?

Id: [0x00047806]
Ezio, we want to help.

Id: [0x00047807]
I was trying to help you by sending you to Firenze.

Id: [0x00047808]
This is different.

Id: [0x0004780C]
[Short laugh] Ezio.

Id: [0x0004780F]
La Volpe. I am surprised to see you.

Id: [0x00047810]
And why have you appeared at my door? Wait, I know the answer.

Id: [0x00047812]
You always do.

Id: [0x00047813]
You want to put my spies to work.

Id: [0x00047814]
Then, join me.

Id: [0x00047815]
In aiding Machiavelli? No thank you. That man is a traitor to our Order.

Id: [0x00047816]
A serious allegation, coming from a thief. What is your proof?

Id: [0x00047819]
He was an ambassador to the Papal court and travelled as the personal guest of Cesare himself. I also know he abandoned you right before the Villa attack.

Id: [0x0004781B]
Machiavelli may not please all tastes, but he is an Assassin, not a traitor.

Id: [0x0004781C]
I am not convinced.

Id: [0x0004784E]
The guards are looking for you.

Id: [0x0004784F]
I see they have posters up.

Id: [0x00047850]
Then rip them down. You can pay the Heralds a few florins to silence them.

Id: [0x00047851]
Or I can eliminate witnesses.

Id: [0x00047853]
Volpe, listen to me. I know what we saw, but you have nothing to fear from Machiavelli, I am sure of it.

Id: [0x00047854]
I have you to thank for saving Claudio's life. If you believe Machiavelli remains loyal to the order, I trust you.

Id: [0x00047861]
Claudia, Bartolomeo and La Volpe are waiting for you inside. I can't imagine how you did it.

Id: [0x00047862]
Virtù, (virtue,) Machiavelli.

Id: [0x0004786A]
Only if the opportunity to assassinate them arises will I take it.

Id: [0x00047871]
Ser Ezio, I represent the combined resources of Bartolomeo d'Alviano, Claudia Auditore and La Volpe. Through my associates spread across the city you can channel your florins to any part of the underground you desire.

Id: [0x00047874]
Molto bene. (Very good.)

Id: [0x0004787E]
Hard to believe that this was once the center of the world. That these dirt roads were paved boulevards. Those crumbled mounds of stone, proud forums and temples...

Id: [0x0004787F]
This city tells the story of the world. All of human history aligns to this pattern: Rising and falling - like the swell of the sea. And behind each movement - our brotherhood.

Id: [0x00047880]
Strange to think we command such power over time and space when a single artifact causes so much consternation.

Id: [0x00047881]
It is part of the pattern. Our troubles will be ended - and new ones shall emerge in their place.

Id: [0x00047882]
You certainly know how to lift a man's spirits.

Id: [0x00047883]
So I've been told.

Id: [0x00047886]
Look at that.

Id: [0x00047887]
What man cannot make, he takes. How else was the light of knowledge returned to our part of the world?

Id: [0x00047888]
We did not steal this knowledge.

Id: [0x00047889]
No? The doors were opened by the Templars when they crusaded against the Saracens. Imagine where we'd be now, had they never journeyed to the Holy Land.

Id: [0x0004788A]
They could have come in peace.

Id: [0x0004788B]
That would have run counter to man's instincts. We are inherently selfish. Observe children at play. They smash and grab and scream and tear. It is only the intrusive hand of the teacher or parent that bades them stop.

Id: [0x0004788C]
You seem to hold your fellow man in rather low regard.

Id: [0x0004788D]
Do not mistake the observation of a fact for contempt. It is what it is. We are what we are.

Id: [0x00047890]
What became of the Roman libraries? Were their contents stolen? Destroyed? All that ancient knowledge lost...

Id: [0x00047891]
Not lost. Swept away by a sea of fear and hate. And we alone, left to guard against its return.

Id: [0x00047893]
Some good we've done...

Id: [0x00047894]
No doubt it's hard. But remember - just as civilizations fall, so too do they rise: before the Romans, there were the Etruscans, and before them - Minerva and her people. This land has blossomed and withered and blossomed again - a hundred times across the ages. The ground is fertile here. It can be made to grow anew.

Id: [0x00047896]
Perhaps. But it's going to be very difficult.

Id: [0x00047897]
When is it ever not?

Id: [0x0004789A]
Salute Niccolo! I trust your trip was uneventful?

Id: [0x0004789B]
Not exactly. But, as we're still alive, I'll not complain.

Id: [0x0004789C]
Yes. The city's become a bit dangerous as of late. It's those damned Borgia. They prefer things this way.

Id: [0x0004789E]
Ah! Ser Ezio, a pleasure.

Id: [0x000478A0]
Fabio Orsini, at your service. I've heard a great deal about you from my cousin - Bartolomeo D'Alviano.

Id: [0x000478A2]
A fine warrior.

Id: [0x000478A3]
He'd better be! Can't have him dishonoring the Orsini name.

Id: [0x000478A5]
Come in. Make yourselves at home.

Id: [0x000478A7]
You'll find no better a place to conduct your business in all of Roma. Some redecorating might be in order, but she's sturdy and secure.

Id: [0x000478AA]
Four walls and a roof is all we need. This will do.

Id: [0x000478AB]
For now.

Id: [0x000478AD]
Have you found the Apple?

Id: [0x000478AF]
It's being kept here - in Castel Sant'Angelo.

Id: [0x000478B0]
And you know this how?

Id: [0x000478B1]
Information is my trade, just as death is yours.

Id: [0x000478B2]
And what of Cesare?

Id: [0x000478B3]
Likely there as well, plotting the next steps of his campaign.

Id: [0x000478B4]
Then we can have both the Apple AND his life.

Id: [0x000478B5]
Tread carefully, Ezio. You are indeed our strongest blade - but Cesare is clever - and has youth on his side.

Id: [0x000478D3]
Ayúdenme. Mi hijo. Mi hijo está herido. (Help me. My son. My son is wounded.)

Id: [0x000478F2]
Lieta di conoscervi. (Nice to meet you.)

Id: [0x000478F3]
Yes, we did.

Id: [0x000478F7]
And I want your courtesans to find Caterina Sforza.

Id: [0x000478FA]
You can count on us.

Id: [0x000478FB]
Va bene (Okay), but in return I need to know Cesare and Rodrigo's every move. Can your men keep track of them for me?

Id: [0x000478FC]
Of course!

Id: [0x000478FD]
One last thing, I need your spies to find the Apple. It has been taken from me.

Id: [0x000478FE]
We are searching the city for it already.

Id: [0x000478FF]
Molto bene. (Very good.) Come to Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island) with your findings.

Id: [0x00047904]
My arm.

Id: [0x00047905]
That hurts!

Id: [0x00047907]
Merda. (Shit.)

Id: [0x0004790E]
What a night this has been.

Id: [0x0004790F]
The inn looks perfect. No one will ever suspect its real purpose.

Id: [0x00047916]
Rodrigo surrounds himself with snakes and murderers. Even his daughter Lucrezia has been sharpened into one of his most artful weapons. But she pales in comparison to the man behind the Villa attack.

Id: [0x00047919]
Cesare, head of the Papal armies.

Id: [0x0004791A]
Give me his name.

Id: [0x0004791C]
I heard about Mario.

Id: [0x0004791E]
Many years ago, we fought side by side in the Battle of Nancy. I will never forget him.

Id: [0x0004791F]
Then let us ensure Cesare never does either.

Id: [0x00047920]
Bene. That is what I like to hear!

Id: [0x00047930]
Caterina is a powerful ally, if we help her now while she is weak, she will aid us in return.

Id: [0x00047931]
Perhaps. But kill Cesare and Rodrigo first.

Id: [0x00047932]
They are going to torture her.

Id: [0x00047933]
Forget the Pope, you answer only to me. Roma is the pillar that holds our entire enterprise aloft. She cannot waver. Which means neither can you.

Id: [0x00047934]
What of il Vaticano (The Vatican)?

Id: [0x00047935]
That tired old men's club? Play along for now, but soon we will have no need of them.

Id: [0x00047937]
He's left us Roma.

Id: [0x00047938]
She'll be in good hands.

Id: [0x0004793B]
He is away from the Castello, and he might need some convincing when he returns.

Id: [0x0004793C]
That shouldn't be a problem, should it?

Id: [0x0004793E]
I cannot wait.

Id: [0x0004793F]
Behave yourself while I am gone.

Id: [0x00047945]
Buona fortuna, (Good fortune) Padron Cesare!

Id: [0x00047946]
Machiavelli is going to be very disappointed.

Id: [0x0004794B]
How was the journey to Roma? Did you sit in Cesare's private carriage?

Id: [0x0004794D]
What did he talk about? His plans for Napoli? [beat] Did you like it?

Id: [0x0004794E]
I can't remember.

Id: [0x0004794F]
Perhaps you will remember this.

Id: [0x00047952]
That put you in your place.

Id: [0x00047953]
So says the bitch in chains.

Id: [0x00047954]
You bear your own.

Id: [0x00047956]
Do I?

Id: [0x00047957]
Yes. And they're far firmer than mine. You are a creation. A plaything. Shaped to please your father and brother - and those who's power they crave. You're the true prisoner. I'm merely visiting...

Id: [0x00047959]
Enough with your prattle. Be silent.

Id: [0x0004795A]
Why? Don't like what you're hearing?

Id: [0x00047961]
Lock it and give me the key!

Id: [0x00047966]
Anything else I can reach, Princess?

Id: [0x0004796A]
I can't seem to grab it.

Id: [0x0004796B]
Why not move closer to us, Principessa (Princess)? We will help you.

Id: [0x0004796D]
No. You must come closer. You boys are being so good to me.

Id: [0x00047970]
Paying a visit to the tailor.

Id: [0x00047971]
Rescuing me will provoke Cesare's wrath.

Id: [0x00047972]
Fortunately for us, he is away. Any chance there is a second key?

Id: [0x00047973]
The guard handed his to Lucrezia, so I assume not.

Id: [0x00047974]
Do you know where she is?

Id: [0x00047975]
Her quarters are at the top of the Castello.

Id: [0x00047979]
I love you so, I want to sing it to the heavens.

Id: [0x0004797A]
Please! You must whisper it only to yourself. If Cesare found out, who knows what he would do.

Id: [0x0004797B]
Are you not newly widowed?

Id: [0x0004797C]
He killed my husband.

Id: [0x0004797D]
Oh.

Id: [0x0004797E]
Cesare has always been jealous of my attentions, but that should not deter us.

Id: [0x00047986]
He loves me.

Id: [0x00047987]
He loves me not.

Id: [0x00047988]
He loves me.

Id: [0x00047989]
He loves me not.

Id: [0x0004799B]
No.

Id: [0x0004799C]
Why save me, Ezio? With Forlì taken, I am useless to you.

Id: [0x0004799E]
You have a family.

Id: [0x0004799F]
It is not your family.

Id: [0x000479A0]
That night at the Villa. I had to ensure our allegiance to protect Forlì. Do you understand, Ezio?

Id: [0x000479A1]
È la politica. (Politics.) [beat] Of course. I knew it. You need not explain.

Id: [0x000479B5]
It seems to open from over there.

Id: [0x000479B6]
Wait here.

Id: [0x000479B8]
Ezio! Aiuto! (Help!)

Id: [0x000479BD]
I guess we are going out the front.

Id: [0x000479C2]
We have to get away from here.

Id: [0x000479C4]
Ride across the bridge. I will cover you.

Id: [0x000479C7]
Go to Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island). Find Machiavelli there. He will be waiting for me.

Id: [0x000479C8]
What about you?

Id: [0x000479C9]
Someone has to stay here and distract the guards.

Id: [0x000479CA]
Get back in one piece, or I will never forgive myself.

Id: [0x000479CB]
Go!

Id: [0x000479D0]
Hurry, Ezio.

Id: [0x000479D8]
Where is Machiavelli?

Id: [0x000479D9]
I could not find him.

Id: [0x000479DB]
What was that?

Id: [0x000479DF]
I brought the Contessa (Countess) here.

Id: [0x000479E1]
Caterina.

Id: [0x000479E2]
Care to tell us where you have been?

Id: [0x000479E3]
Looking for Ezio. What of Cesare and Rodrigo?

Id: [0x000479E4]
Cesare rode off before I could get close to him and Rodrigo was somewhere else entirely.

Id: [0x000479E5]
That is odd. Rodrigo is usually at the Castello.

Id: [0x000479E6]
Very odd indeed.

Id: [0x000479E7]
What a waste. [to Caterina] No offense.

Id: [0x000479E8]
None taken.

Id: [0x000479EA]
I am of no use to anyone without Forlì. I leave to be with my children and await the restoration of my lands.

Id: [0x000479EE]
I wish you would stay.

Id: [0x000479EF]
You are the leader of the Assassins now. Unite them, Ezio Auditore and take back Roma.

Id: [0x000479F2]
I thought we intended to strike now?

Id: [0x000479F3]
Impossible. Cesare commands a massive army in Romagna. You would never reach him.

Id: [0x000479F6]
I say we work here. In Roma. Erode the Borgia's influence while restoring our own. And, in fact, I want to begin right now.

Id: [0x000479F8]
Volpe, bring Claudia and Bartolomeo here. Machiavelli, meet me outside.

Id: [0x00047A02]
Rescuing princesses from castles now?

Id: [0x00047A0E]
Do you know what became of the Pazzi once your hunt was finished? Your dear friend Lorenzo stripped them of everything and threw them into prison. Even those who played no part in the conspiracy.

Id: [0x00047A13]
Cesare will finish what he started and bring peace to Italia. He kills for a higher purpose, unlike you!

Id: [0x00047A16]
You ignored the consequences of your actions, content to set events into motion but unwilling to see them through.

Id: [0x00047A1A]
Whatever. My words are wasted here, ipocrita (hypocrite).

Id: [0x00047A21]
Look. The Borgia rob everything from the people to maintain power.

Id: [0x00047A24]
What do you intend to do?

Id: [0x00047A25]
We will recruit him to our cause.

Id: [0x00047A26]
You cannot be serious.

Id: [0x00047A2B]
To win this war, Machiavelli, we need loyal soldiers. By recruiting enemies of the state, we arm those who have been disarmed by the Borgia.

Id: [0x00047A2E]
Go then. Recruit our first novices.

Id: [0x00047A33]
Pst. Ezio! Over here.

Id: [0x00047A35]
Who is it?

Id: [0x00047A38]
Chi è là? (Whos is there?)

Id: [0x00047A39]
Ezio!

Id: [0x00047A3B]
Leonardo!

Id: [0x00047A3F]
Come here.

Id: [0x00047A41]
Forgive me. The Borgia have commandeered my services. Actually, they would have killed me had I refused.

Id: [0x00047A44]
What do they want?

Id: [0x00047A45]
War machines. I have constructed weapons for all the Borgia guards and other terrible monstrosities besides. They are very well designed, Ezio. Here.

Id: [0x00047A4A]
Hmm. Remaking them will be easy, I never forget a design, but you must compensate me for the raw material.

Id: [0x00047A4B]
Really? They are not paying you at il Vaticano (the Vatican)?

Id: [0x00047A4C]
If we are to do this, we must appear to not meet at all.

Id: [0x00047A50]
A hand pointing?

Id: [0x00047A51]
It's pointing to where you should sit. So, sit!

Id: [0x00047A53]
Yes, maestro.

Id: [0x00047A56]
What would you like me to make for you?

Id: [0x00047A59]
I will be in the area for a little while longer if you change your mind.

Id: [0x00047A5B]
If you decide to buy something, look for the chalk outline on benches.

Id: [0x00047A5D]
I will wait nearby for a few more hours in case you change your mind.

Id: [0x00047A60]
I must return to my workshop. Wait here.

Id: [0x00047A62]
Bene. (Good.) I will return shortly.

Id: [0x00047A64]
Wait here. I will be back soon.

Id: [0x00047A66]
What can I bring you this time, Ezio?

Id: [0x00047A67]
Back for more designs?

Id: [0x00047A69]
You have everything I can possibly design for you already.

Id: [0x00047A6A]
I cannot think of anything else to make for you.

Id: [0x00047A6B]
You have all that I can give. Now you are on your own.

Id: [0x00047A6C]
Here!

Id: [0x00047A6D]
Take this, Ezio. Quickly.

Id: [0x00047A6E]
Everything should be to your liking.

Id: [0x00047A7A]
I can kill double the guards.

Id: [0x00047A7C]
Now nothing will be out of my reach.

Id: [0x00047A7E]
The Borgia won't be the only ones with strong poison.

Id: [0x00047A83]
Just a small sting and my enemies will fall.

Id: [0x00047A85]
Ah. The aim is much improved.

Id: [0x00047A87]
These extra bullets will come in handy.

Id: [0x00047A89]
You never cease to amaze me, Leonardo.

Id: [0x00047A8B]
This sure beats throwing knives.

Id: [0x00047A8D]
You just keep outdoing yourself.

Id: [0x00047A8F]
Even deadlier weaponry. I like it.

Id: [0x00047A91]
The range will be much greater.

Id: [0x00047A93]
With these, I can finally climb anywhere I desire.

Id: [0x00047A98]
The names of the Templars overseeing their construction. Cesare intends to supply his army with my creations. You must dismantle them.

Id: [0x00047A99]
Grazie. (Thank you.) I will take care of the plans and the machines.

Id: [0x00047A9B]
Where have you been?

Id: [0x00047A9C]
There is far graver news, I am afraid. They have the Apple.

Id: [0x00047A9D]
Yes, I know. [beat] I gave the Apple to Mario.

Id: [0x00047AA0]
I am sorry, Ezio. [beat] Cesare left it in my hands to study, to make it work. Then Rodrigo took it from me, I know not where.

Id: [0x00047AA2]
I will recover it in time. Leonardo, I have lost all the codex inventions you once fashioned for me.

Id: [0x00047AA4]
We all have our secrets.

Id: [0x00047AA5]
Bartolomeo sends his apologies. The French have doubled their assault.

Id: [0x00047AA6]
I took the liberty of setting up a means of communication with your recruits. We send orders via carrier pigeon.

Id: [0x00047AA8]
I've scanned the contents and created a dynamic menu. You can access it from the Animus Desktop.

Id: [0x00047AAA]
Try sending them on a mission.

Id: [0x00047AAC]
Nifty, huh?

Id: [0x00047AAD]
Nifty? That word is just...forget it. It's just timelessly terrible.

Id: [0x00047AAF]
Desmond, I've scanned Leo's location into the map so you can keep track of him when he moves.

Id: [0x00047AB0]
Claudia.

Id: [0x00047AB1]
Ezio.

Id: [0x00047AB3]
Thank you, Machiavelli.

Id: [0x00047AB5]
My plan is to attack both. If we cut off his funds, Cesare will lose his army and return without his men. So, I ask you, where does he get his money? Volpe?

Id: [0x00047AB6]
I know someone who owes The Banker money. Senator Egidio Troche comes in all the time and complains.

Id: [0x00047ABC]
Even with those troops gone, the Papal Guard will continue to protect the inner gate.

Id: [0x00047ABD]
There is a side entrance. Lucrezia's latest plaything, Pietro, has a key.

Id: [0x00047ACA]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00047ACF]
Vittoria agli Assassini! (Victory to the Assassins!)

Id: [0x00047AD1]
Many will die if you remain here.

Id: [0x00047AD2]
They're forfeit anyway.

Id: [0x00047AD3]
Ezio...

Id: [0x00047AD4]
I don't like it any more than you, Caterina. But it's the only option we have. Live are lost today that more might be saved tomorrow.

Id: [0x00047AD5]
It's the first sensible thing you've said since we arrived in Roma (Rome). Now we must devise a plan.

Id: [0x00047AD7]
My time amongst the enemy was not entirely unproductive. Perhaps I can be of service.

Id: [0x00047AD9]
Cesare has set three of his closest allies to govern Rome. Each controls a district where they ensure an obedient populace and resources for his campaign.

Id: [0x00047ADB]
Remove a district's leader and Cesare will lose their contributions to his cause.

Id: [0x00047ADD]
Money. Soldiers. Equipment. Deprived of these things, the heart of the Borgia empire will shrivel.

Id: [0x00047ADE]
At which point you tear it out.

Id: [0x00047AE0]
Where do you wish to begin?

Id: [0x00047AE1]
Are we not trying to kill Cesare?

Id: [0x00047AE2]
It is not enough to merely kill him, we must cut the head of the hydra off at the base. Take away everything that gives the Templars power, everything that keeps Roma under their sway. (We will exorcise the influence of the Templars and we will take back Roma.) If we do this, the Borgia empire will go out like a lamp that has been drained of oil. It will be a simple matter to enter the Castel and finish them off.

Id: [0x00047AE6]
Vittoria agli Assassini. (Victory to the Assassins.)

Id: [0x00047AE7]
He was at the Castello.

Id: [0x00047AF1]
This is their camp?!

Id: [0x00047AFC]
What good are you to her dead? We will regroup and fight through the gates as we did at the Arsenale.

Id: [0x00047AFF]
The entrance is thicker with Frenchmen than the streets of Paris.

Id: [0x00047B00]
So we will climb the battlements.

Id: [0x00047B01]
They cannot be scaled. [beat] Pantasilea would know what to do.

Id: [0x00047B02]
Perché non ci ho pensato prima? (Why didn't I think of it before?)

Id: [0x00047B03]
What did I say?

Id: [0x00047B04]
Call your men back to the barracks. I will explain there.

Id: [0x00047B08]
Amore mio, help me. There's no way in.

Id: [0x00047B09]
We'll fight through the gates as we did at the Arsenale.

Id: [0x00047B0B]
Valois' stronghold is thicker with Frenchmen than the streets of Paris.

Id: [0x00047B0C]
So we'll climb the battlements.

Id: [0x00047B0D]
Every wall is guarded, we would never make it to the top.

Id: [0x00047B0E]
Why are you suddenly so cautious? Don't tell me that you, Bartolomeo d'Alviano, fear death?

Id: [0x00047B0F]
My own, no. But my wife's...

Id: [0x00047B10]
What do you suggest then?

Id: [0x00047B11]
Enter bearing gifts and hope that [coward] spares her life.

Id: [0x00047B12]
[Why didn't I think of it before?] That's it!

Id: [0x00047B13]
What did I say?

Id: [0x00047B14]
You better have something good. (to his men) Fall back!

Id: [0x00047B18]
I will get the armor.

Id: [0x00047B19]
My troops will gather it from the dead. We will then depart from the north, so as not to arouse suspicion.

Id: [0x00047B1A]
And, Ezio. Make sure to kill them without a fight. The armor has to stay clean.

Id: [0x00047B1B]
The Baron thinks Cesare will allow the French to rule Italy. He's so blinded by the trickle of royalty in his blood, that lazy inbred can't see the battlefield. Whatever the French may think, Cesare intends to be king.

Id: [0x00047B1D]
I will kill them. Keep your uniforms clean.

Id: [0x00047B20]
What part of France are you from?

Id: [0x00047B22]
Dawn is almost upon us. Hurry!

Id: [0x00047B23]
Ezio. Time is short.

Id: [0x00047B28]
How dare you?

Id: [0x00047B2A]
You think that commanding an army grants you nobility? Nobility comes from fighting beside your soldiers, not kidnapping a woman to cheat your way out of battle. Why don't you grow a pair and release my wife?

Id: [0x00047B2C]
You may have power, but you will never have glory.

Id: [0x00047B2D]
You savages never learn.

Id: [0x00047B31]
Ezio. You have to save my wife. Take the rooftops.

Id: [0x00047B32]
Pantasilea!

Id: [0x00047B33]
Really? But you rescued me.

Id: [0x00047B34]
Ezio came up with a brilliant plan.

Id: [0x00047B35]
I did not. It was all your husband's idea.

Id: [0x00047B36]
It was?

Id: [0x00047B37]
You are my prince.

Id: [0x00047B38]
Now I better earn that title.

Id: [0x00047B39]
You will.

Id: [0x00047B3B]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00047B44]
Who are you?

Id: [0x00047B46]
Did Rodrigo send you? Tell him it was all Cesare's plan.

Id: [0x00047B48]
Cesare has been bribing the cardinals. Once he conquered the rest of Italie, I was to ride into Rome and seize the Vatican.

Id: [0x00047B4A]
It was not my idea. I am above such scheming.

Id: [0x00047B4E]
I have the King's ear. An estate or title in France will be yours.

Id: [0x00047B54]
Please. I will kill her.

Id: [0x00047B5A]
I only wanted respect.

Id: [0x00047B5B]
Respect is earned, not inherited or purchased.

Id: [0x00047B5C]
Perhaps you are right... I need more time...

Id: [0x00047B5D]
Che tu sia pari nella morte. (May you be equal in death.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x00047B5F]
So, you have a plan?

Id: [0x00047B61]
Especially if the patrols are taken completely by surprise?

Id: [0x00047B62]
Ma certo. (Of course.)

Id: [0x00047B76]
Chien d'Italien. (Italian dog.)

Id: [0x00047B77]
Prosterne-toi devant tes maîtres. (Bow before us, your masters.)

Id: [0x00047B78]
Regardez-le, il a honte de ce qu'il est! (Look at him, he is ashamed of what he is!)

Id: [0x00047B7C]
Don't ever disappear again. I was lost without you.

Id: [0x00047B7D]
I knew you were behind the break-in at Sant'Angelo! It is good to see you, friend.

Id: [0x00047B84]
Now, where is that Senator?

Id: [0x00047B87]
Egidio's been asking for money again.

Id: [0x00047B88]
What is it for this time?

Id: [0x00047B95]
Not you. You raise money for false causes to pay back your gambling debts.

Id: [0x00047B96]
Your bill has come due.

Id: [0x00047B97]
Make an exception for an old man.

Id: [0x00047B98]
No.

Id: [0x00047B9A]
The Banker sent us to collect.

Id: [0x00047B9B]
I will have his money momentarily.

Id: [0x00047B9C]
Not good enough.

Id: [0x00047BA2]
A good Samaritan in Roma? I thought they were a dying breed.

Id: [0x00047BA4]
Senators used to petition about real issues, like unlawful cruelty, abandoned children. Now we write up legislation on the appropriate width of women's sleeves.

Id: [0x00047BA5]
False causes! I am interested in pursuing them as soon as I am financially able to do so.

Id: [0x00047BA8]
Senator Egidio Troche.

Id: [0x00047BA9]
I don't owe you money too, do I?

Id: [0x00047BAA]
I'm looking for Cesare's banker.

Id: [0x00047BAB]
Ha. Cesare Borgia? And you are?

Id: [0x00047BAC]
A friend of the family.

Id: [0x00047BAD]
Cesare has a lot of friends these days. Unfortunately, I am not one of them.

Id: [0x00047BAE]
I can pay.

Id: [0x00047BAF]
Ma che meraviglia! (Well, isn't that something?) He fights guards and he gives away money. Where have you been all my life?

Id: [0x00047BB3]
We better get out of here.

Id: [0x00047BB6]
Someone really wants you dead.

Id: [0x00047BB7]
A few months ago my brother Francesco, the Pope's Chamberlain -- I know, I know, don't get me started -- He told me of Cesare's plans for Romagna. I wrote to the ambassador of Venezia, warning him. One of my letters must have been intercepted.

Id: [0x00047BB8]
And whoring.

Id: [0x00047BB9]
Oh, you're good. Was it the perfume on my sleeve?

Id: [0x00047BBB]
You ever look at a grave and think "This is the most significant thing I will ever do"?

Id: [0x00047BC0]
Benvenuto (Welcome) to the home of my brother, Francesco. Thank God he's not here, we haven't talked since he found out about the letters. [beat] What did you want again?

Id: [0x00047BC4]
Cesare's banker.

Id: [0x00047BC5]
Right. I need to arrive with the money. Problem is, there is no money.

Id: [0x00047BCA]
You are meeting the Banker? Where?

Id: [0x00047BCC]
I will bring you all the money you owe.

Id: [0x00047BD1]
I never know until I'm there. I go to one of three places. Then his friends take me to him.

Id: [0x00047BD3]
Sul serio? (Seriously?) You need to stop this. You might actually give me hope!

Id: [0x00047BD4]
Something like that.

Id: [0x00047BD5]
I guess not.

Id: [0x00047BEA]
Por favor. My legs. I am not able to stop the bleeding.

Id: [0x00047BEB]
I have done all I can, now you must trust in God.

Id: [0x00047BEC]
I'm afraid. Mis piernas. (My legs.) Mis piernas. (My legs.)

Id: [0x00047BED]
Shhh. Think of all the coin you will be paid come the end of the battle.

Id: [0x00047BEF]
Who is this Count of Lerin?

Id: [0x00047BF0]
We are fighting for him are we not?

Id: [0x00047BF1]
We are fighting for no one.

Id: [0x00047C04]
It's a beautiful sight. At least, from up here. But I digress.

Id: [0x00047C05]
Animi, as far as the eye can see.

Id: [0x00047C08]
Our engineers have spent countless hours perfecting this top-secret, state-of-the-art facility, in order to house our most ambitious project to date.

Id: [0x00047C0B]
You stand in this room today because you have served us impeccably, need I say, loyally. Now, it is time for you to become so much more.

Id: [0x00047C0D]
We have uploaded DNA from dozens of our most...remarkable subjects and distilled the essence of their unique abilities.

Id: [0x00047C10]
Maledette (Fucking) letters. I should never have sent them to the ambassador. Now Cesare will murder me.

Id: [0x00047C11]
The Senate has nothing to do these days, the Borgia have taken all the power. You know what it's like to not have un cazzo (fuck) to do? It changes a man. I admit I've been gambling, drinking.

Id: [0x00047C1E]
I cannot believe you would just do this.

Id: [0x00047C1F]
There is a condition.

Id: [0x00047C20]
I knew it.

Id: [0x00047C21]
Keep an eye on the politics of the city. I want you to report back to Maria at the Rosa in Fiore (Blooming Rose) about targets who are helping the Borgia.

Id: [0x00047C22]
And what, you'll...make them disappear?

Id: [0x00047C25]
I will follow you to the Banker.

Id: [0x00047C2E]
Egidio. It seems you are ready to die like a gentleman.

Id: [0x00047C2F]
I have the money.

Id: [0x00047C30]
Oh. That's different then. The Banker will be pleased. You came alone?

Id: [0x00047C31]
Do you see anyone else here?

Id: [0x00047C32]
Follow me, furbacchione (wise-ass).

Id: [0x00047C3D]
Egidio brought the money.

Id: [0x00047C3E]
Well, well. The Banker has a special evening planned. I will be delivering your payment. Give it here.

Id: [0x00047C42]
Hold him until I get back!

Id: [0x00047C47]
Why not release me? I have paid.

Id: [0x00047C48]
He is counting the money. Until it is counted you cannot leave.

Id: [0x00047C4A]
What is taking him so long?

Id: [0x00047C4B]
He has to count the money from all the Banker's clients.

Id: [0x00047C4C]
Did he not do that already?

Id: [0x00047C4D]
He must not have written it down.

Id: [0x00047C4E]
Oh.

Id: [0x00047C55]
Now to go kill that Senator.

Id: [0x00047C58]
Who's there?

Id: [0x00047C5D]
Take the money, it's yours!

Id: [0x00047C5E]
Get away from me!

Id: [0x00047C5F]
No, no!

Id: [0x00047C61]
Everything going well in there?

Id: [0x00047C62]
We have to go, Luigi, or we'll be late!

Id: [0x00047C68]
Va bene. (Okay.) [to his men, referring to Egidio] Kill him.

Id: [0x00047C69]
No!

Id: [0x00047C6B]
Luigi says he gets to live.

Id: [0x00047C6F]
Lead the way, boss.

Id: [0x00047C76]
Isn't the Banker the other way?

Id: [0x00047C82]
The route you are taking is very...interesting. I would not have gone this way, but who am I?

Id: [0x00047C88]
He's going in the wrong direction.

Id: [0x00047C8A]
Respectfully, Signore (Sir), I am not sure where you are going.

Id: [0x00047C8C]
Going this way makes no sense.

Id: [0x00047C8E]
Now we are making good time.

Id: [0x00047C90]
Soon this job will be over.

Id: [0x00047C92]
Now we're going the right way.

Id: [0x00047C94]
We're on track.

Id: [0x00047C98]
I know the city's pretty confusing but this is ridiculous.

Id: [0x00047C9A]
It is so nice to explore the city. Ideally we would be going the other way. I am not complaining though.

Id: [0x00047C9C]
Do you think he's forgotten where we're going?

Id: [0x00047CA1]
We are nearly there.

Id: [0x00047CA3]
Soon the party will be all around us.

Id: [0x00047CA5]
They are going to let us in. I know it.

Id: [0x00047CAB]
Hand me the chest, Luigi. I will bring it to the Banker.

Id: [0x00047CAD]
You may enter.

Id: [0x00047CAF]
We can't go in?

Id: [0x00047CB0]
You have to patrol by order of Cesare.

Id: [0x00047CB1]
Cesare? He's here?

Id: [0x00047CB3]
Luigi has been killed. We discovered his body at the Pantheon.

Id: [0x00047CB5]
Luigi? We just let him in.

Id: [0x00047CB6]
Porca puttana (Fuck me!)

Id: [0x00047CC2]
Hello there.

Id: [0x00047CC3]
Hello.

Id: [0x00047CC4]
Mind if I walk with you?

Id: [0x00047CC5]
Ja, (Yes,) I mean, I do not mind.

Id: [0x00047CC6]
I've never been to Trastevere before. The old ruins make me nervous.

Id: [0x00047CC7]
It's not mine.

Id: [0x00047CC8]
But you are holding it in those strong arms of yours.

Id: [0x00047CC9]
You want to touch them?

Id: [0x00047CCE]
I will take that.

Id: [0x00047CD0]
And that.

Id: [0x00047CD2]
You are dismissed.

Id: [0x00047CD4]
Onoratissima. (It's an honor.)

Id: [0x00047CD5]
Welcome to my party. I am Juan Borgia.

Id: [0x00047CD7]
Money for you, Banker.

Id: [0x00047CDA]
For the Banker.

Id: [0x00047CDD]
Cesare is about to speak in the main room, Eccellenza (Excellence).

Id: [0x00047CDE]
Come.

Id: [0x00047D02]
Are you having a pleasant evening?

Id: [0x00047D03]
Yes, Eccellenza (Excellence), I am. There is so much to look at.

Id: [0x00047D04]
Oh good. I spared no expense.

Id: [0x00047D05]
I can tell.

Id: [0x00047D06]
The finer things in life make power so rewarding. I see an apple, I can pluck that apple. No one will stop me.

Id: [0x00047D07]
Well, it depends whose tree it is.

Id: [0x00047D08]
You don't seem to understand, my dear. I own all the trees.

Id: [0x00047D16]
Thank you all for coming. We have a long night ahead of us.

Id: [0x00047D1C]
Soon we will be here once more celebrating a united Italia and then the feasting will last for forty days and forty nights! Cominciamo ora! (Begin now!) [Laugh]

Id: [0x00047D1E]
We did not agree to conquer Italia.

Id: [0x00047D1F]
I appreciate all that you have done for me, but I have the army, so I am making the decisions. [beat] Don't look so glum, enjoy yourself.

Id: [0x00047D25]
Do you like that?

Id: [0x00047D26]
Oh, Dio, sì! (Oh, God. Yes!)

Id: [0x00047D27]
Let me touch you.

Id: [0x00047D29]
Ancora! (Do that again!)

Id: [0x00047D2A]
Keep going!

Id: [0x00047D2B]
Look at me.

Id: [0x00047D37]
If your brilliant Captain General says we can do it, why not rejoice and let it happen?

Id: [0x00047D38]
You risk upsetting the delicate balance of control we have worked so hard to tighten.

Id: [0x00047D3A]
What better way to celebrate my victories than to join in the brotherhood of man?

Id: [0x00047D4E]
The things I have felt, seen and tasted. I do not regret a moment of it.

Id: [0x00047D50]
A man of power must be contemptuous of delicacies.

Id: [0x00047D51]
But...I gave the people what they wanted.

Id: [0x00047D52]
And now you pay for it. Il piacere immeritato si consuma da sé (Pleasure unearned consumes itself.)  Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x00047D65]
Buongiorno (Hello), Ezio.

Id: [0x00047D66]
It is time to pay a visit to Lucrezia's lover, Pietro.

Id: [0x00047D67]
I've sent my men out to find him.

Id: [0x00047D68]
Molto bene. (Very good.)

Id: [0x00047D69]
Ezio. If I may...

Id: [0x00047D6A]
What is it?

Id: [0x00047D6B]
Someone warned Rodrigo to stay away from the Castello.

Id: [0x00047D6E]
We must not be split apart by mere suspicion.

Id: [0x00047D73]
The Borgia know the locations of our spies!

Id: [0x00047D74]
Ezio.

Id: [0x00047D79]
Machiavelli?

Id: [0x00047D7D]
What were you able to find out?

Id: [0x00047D7E]
Pietro is to be assassinated this evening. Cesare sent his butcher.

Id: [0x00047D83]
Micheletto. The best killer in Roma. No one escapes him.

Id: [0x00047D84]
Until tonight. Come on.

Id: [0x00047D86]
Did you uncover information about Pietro?

Id: [0x00047D87]
The man is an actor and he is performing in a play stanotte (tonight).

Id: [0x00047D89]
What did you find out about Pietro?

Id: [0x00047D8A]
He is to be suspended from a cross. Micheletto will come for him with a spear.

Id: [0x00047D8C]
Where is Pietro?

Id: [0x00047D8D]
I cannot tell you. But Micheletto waits at the city gate east of the Terme di Traiano (Baths of Trajan). He intends to disguise his men to make the killing look like an accident.

Id: [0x00047D8F]
I still do not believe Machiavelli has turned traitor.

Id: [0x00047D90]
First the Villa attack, then the Castello and now this. He is behind it all.

Id: [0x00047D91]
He will lead me to Lucrezia's lover.

Id: [0x00047D97]
Ezio, Machiavelli has betrayed us. We would both wish to deny it, but the truth is now clear. Do what needs to be done.

Id: [0x00047DAB]
Please. I have done nothing.

Id: [0x00047DAC]
Francesco Troche, dear friend. Would I lie to you? You told your brother about my war plans in Romagna, who contacted the ambassador of Venezia.

Id: [0x00047DB1]
It was an accident. I am still your servant and ally.

Id: [0x00047DB8]
Are you demanding that I discount your actions and rely on friendship?

Id: [0x00047DB9]
I am asking...not demanding.

Id: [0x00047DBA]
To unite Italia I must have every institution under my control. And if the Church does not fall in line, I will eliminate it entirely.

Id: [0x00047DBF]
You know that I really work for you, not the Pope.

Id: [0x00047DC0]
Ah. But do I, Troche? There's only one way I can know that unconditionally now.

Id: [0x00047DC1]
You intend to kill me? Your most loyal friend?

Id: [0x00047DC2]
Of course not.

Id: [0x00047DC4]
Are you letting me go? Thank you, Cesare. You will not regret--

Id: [0x00047DC8]
Guards! Give Micheletto the costumes for the play. Lucrezia is mine. No one else shall have her. [to Micheletto] Make doubly sure it is done correctly.

Id: [0x00047DC9]
I obey, Cesare.

Id: [0x00047DCA]
Oh yes. Dump Francesco's body in the Tevere (Tiber).

Id: [0x00047DD0]
Once you get dressed, you follow me to the play. Capito? (Understand?)

Id: [0x00047DEA]
Merda (shit.) Which cross is Pietro's?

Id: [0x00047DF4]
High king of heaven, I see thee here. On my hand and on my spear running water throw; and on my eyes some can fall that I may see both one and all. Lord, where does this water come from?

Id: [0x00047DF7]
Alas, alas, and woe is me! What deed have I done? A man I see, sooth to say, I have slain in this stead. Of mercy, lord, I thee now pray, for I was not what I did.

Id: [0x00047DFC]
I need to get onstage.

Id: [0x00047E02]
Hah. You cannot save Pietro. The wine he drank was poisoned. As I promised Cesare, I made doubly sure.

Id: [0x00047E04]
I am not yet dead.

Id: [0x00047E05]
I did not come here to kill you. He who is the cause of someone else becoming powerful is the agent of his own destruction.

Id: [0x00047E0A]
What has happened? What is going on?

Id: [0x00047E0B]
Cut him down!

Id: [0x00047E0D]
[Stuttering] This was not in the rehearsal!

Id: [0x00047E0F]
Stop the guards!

Id: [0x00047E15]
Who are you?

Id: [0x00047E16]
Your savior.

Id: [0x00047E1A]
Ezio, we are here to help!

Id: [0x00047E1C]
Hold off the guards!

Id: [0x00047E1E]
He has been poisoned.

Id: [0x00047E1F]
That pallor. Cantarella. Drink this.

Id: [0x00047E20]
Hurry!

Id: [0x00047E23]
I feel slightly better.

Id: [0x00047E24]
The key to the Castel Sant'Angelo. Now.

Id: [0x00047E25]
What are you talking about? I'm simply a poor actor--

Id: [0x00047E26]
Cesare knows about you and Lucrezia.

Id: [0x00047E27]
Here.

Id: [0x00047E2A]
Un momento! (Hey!) You were at the Villa Auditore during the attack!

Id: [0x00047E30]
Why did you run?

Id: [0x00047E31]
I--

Id: [0x00047E33]
You are the traitor, not Machiavelli.

Id: [0x00047E34]
Long live the Borgia! [Choking sound from stabbing himself in the throat]

Id: [0x00047E36]
Merda! (Shit!) [Beat] I was right. I have to stop La Volpe before he gets to Machiavelli.

Id: [0x00047E44]
I have discovered the traitor.

Id: [0x00047E45]
What?

Id: [0x00047E46]
One of our men, he was at the Villa attack. Here, he carried this letter.

Id: [0x00047E48]
My God.

Id: [0x00047E49]
This is good news.

Id: [0x00047E4B]
More than you know.

Id: [0x00047E4C]
What debt is there amongst friends who trust one another?

Id: [0x00047E4E]
Yes. Thank you for relaying the message in time. (to Machiavelli) Come Niccolò, it has been far too long since we've talked.

Id: [0x00047E4F]
Take this.

Id: [0x00047E50]
This is for you.

Id: [0x00047E51]
Tieni. (Here.)

Id: [0x00047E52]
Your costume.

Id: [0x00047E53]
Il tuo costume. (Your costume.)

Id: [0x00047E54]
Put this on.

Id: [0x00047E55]
Wear this.

Id: [0x00047E56]
Mettilo addosso (Wear this.)

Id: [0x00047E8E]
Hello I--

Id: [0x00047E90]
Mother? Sister?

Id: [0x00047E91]
Ezio. Ser Machiavelli said that you might be here.

Id: [0x00047E92]
What are you doing in Roma? Has Firenze been attacked?

Id: [0x00047E93]
No. Or, rather, I do not know. We did not go to Firenze.

Id: [0x00047E94]
Why?

Id: [0x00047E95]
Ezio, I want to help.

Id: [0x00047E96]
I was trying to help you by sending you to Firenze.

Id: [0x00047E97]
Where is Madonna Pinelli?

Id: [0x00047E98]
Dead.

Id: [0x00047E9A]
No!

Id: [0x00047E9B]
What will we do now?

Id: [0x00047E9C]
Will we have to close?

Id: [0x00047E9D]
You cannot close. I need your help.

Id: [0x00047E9E]
WE need someone with class who can negotiate with our clients. Otherwise WE will go out of business.

Id: [0x00047E9F]
I can do it.

Id: [0x00047EA1]
No. Claudia. As your brother, I'll not allow it.

Id: [0x00047EA2]
I know how to run a business. I ran Uncle Mario's for more than twenty years.

Id: [0x00047EA3]
That is different.

Id: [0x00047EA4]
How is it different?

Id: [0x00047EA5]
What alternative do you have, Ezio? In life we must make sacrifices for the things we believe in.

Id: [0x00047EA7]
If you do this, Claudia, you are no longer my sister. It will just be business between us, nothing more.

Id: [0x00047EA8]
If I can help you fight for what our father and uncle died for, I will do it no matter the cost. Auditore or not.

Id: [0x00047EA9]
Bene. [Fine.]

Id: [0x00047EAB]
I would like to spend this to repair the building. Buy more girls with it as well.

Id: [0x00047EAC]
We have an architetto [architect] right here. Confirm your plan with him.

Id: [0x00047EAD]
And I want your girls to find Caterina Sforza.

Id: [0x00047EAE]
You can count on us.

Id: [0x00047EC0]
Your first time in the Animus will be disorienting. A few of you will panic. To adjust, focus on your training program. Some of you will be in teams protecting or de-synching a VIP, but most of you will be on your own.

Id: [0x00047EC6]
Be ready to receive assassination contracts while being targeted simultaneously. We feel it keeps you on your toes.

Id: [0x00047EE7]
Once you enter these machines and the transfer is complete, you will have the skills necessary to crush the remnants of the Assassin Order, ending this war once and for all. Any questions?

Id: [0x00047EEB]
Good. Let's begin.

Id: [0x00047EEC]
And I don't know if we can stop it.

Id: [0x00047EF5]
You have desecrated the sanctity of this holy place.

Id: [0x00047EF6]
Che cosa fate qui? (What are you doing here?)

Id: [0x00047F38]
Get up here!

Id: [0x00047F39]
Climb, Ezio!

Id: [0x00047F3A]
Hurry Ezio! To the rooftops! We haven't much time!

Id: [0x00047F44]
Tell me how it ended with Borgia. Did Rodrigo beg forgiveness? Make excuses? Promise power in return?

Id: [0x00047F45]
No. None of those things.

Id: [0x00047F46]
Interesting. I'm surprised he remained so composed.

Id: [0x00047F47]
I let him live.

Id: [0x00047F4A]
This place just keeps getting better.

Id: [0x00047F4B]
Thanks to you.

Id: [0x00047F4C]
Claudia, it is good to be home. How is mother?

Id: [0x00047F4F]
Mother.

Id: [0x00047F51]
Ezio. I do not know why you spared him, but I trust your judgment. Machiavelli will come around.

Id: [0x00047F55]
Stand with me!

Id: [0x00047F57]
Ezio!

Id: [0x00047F5A]
Claudia!

Id: [0x00047F5C]
Follow me!

Id: [0x00047F5D]
Where's mother? Is she all right?

Id: [0x00047F5F]
Grazie a Dio. (Thank God.)

Id: [0x00047FEB]
Lucy, I can't seem to get a position on Ezio's P.O.E.

Id: [0x00047FEC]
Sorry, Desmond, Piece of Eden. In the Vatican, Minerva talked about other temples, that they're the key to preventing whatever terrible thing is about to happen to the Earth.

Id: [0x00047FEE]
Right.

Id: [0x00047FEF]
To find the temples I'm convinced we need to get our hands on Ezio's Apple of Eden. Minerva altered it somehow when she "touched" it.

Id: [0x00047FF8]
Hey, I think I've got something.

Id: [0x00047FFA]
[Sigh] It's great to be out of the Animus.

Id: [0x00047FFB]
This isn't exactly my idea of a good time.

Id: [0x00047FFC]
Let me guess: you're more the in bed at six type.

Id: [0x00047FFD]
What? Desmond!

Id: [0x00048002]
I know how to have fun.

Id: [0x00048003]
That's very convincing. Yeah, I'm convinced.

Id: [0x00048004]
Okay, okay. After we save the world, I'll show you.

Id: [0x00048005]
Wait, can I get that in writing?

Id: [0x00048008]
You guys did it!

Id: [0x0004800A]
What's that?

Id: [0x00048031]
The bridge is up. I can't get out!

Id: [0x00048032]
Someone help us! There must be a way through!

Id: [0x00048033]
Aspettate. (Wait.) I see a mechanism that might open it.

Id: [0x00048036]
Grazie (Thank you), Ser Ezio!

Id: [0x00048037]
Cazzo. (Fuck.) The path is blocked again!

Id: [0x00048038]
There is another mechanism, but I cannot get to it unless you pull that lever beside you.

Id: [0x00048039]
I will, Brother!

Id: [0x0004803A]
No, Claudia. Let him do it.

Id: [0x00048040]
Va bene (okay), my turn.

Id: [0x00048042]
It's open!

Id: [0x00048044]
Pull the last one so I can reach you!

Id: [0x00048045]
He is gone. The coward ran as soon as the final bridge came down.

Id: [0x0004804B]
Where does this passage lead?

Id: [0x0004804C]
To the north, outside the walls.

Id: [0x0004804D]
I am surprised it exists.

Id: [0x0004805E]
He was here.

Id: [0x0004805F]
Desmond, what is it?

Id: [0x00048065]
Run! Get out before i soldati (the soldiers) catch you!

Id: [0x00048066]
Correte! (Run!)

Id: [0x0004806A]
Did anything fall on you?

Id: [0x0004806B]
[Cough] No. Is mother all right?

Id: [0x0004806D]
I told you to be careful.

Id: [0x00048075]
Go!

Id: [0x00048081]
Ezio, You've been shot! We have to stop the blood.

Id: [0x00048082]
No time. Keep moving.

Id: [0x00048086]
Dio, ti prego, salvaci (Please God, save us.)

Id: [0x00048088]
The roof is coming down!

Id: [0x0004808D]
Great. It's stuck.

Id: [0x0004808E]
I can get under there.

Id: [0x00048090]
I'll find a way around.

Id: [0x00048094]
There's another lever here.

Id: [0x0004809A]
I can make it through.

Id: [0x0004809C]
Found a switch!

Id: [0x0004809F]
Oh man. It's freezing!

Id: [0x000480A0]
Stop whining.

Id: [0x000480A1]
It's easy for you to say. You aren't swimming in medieval toxic waste. Ughh.

Id: [0x000480A3]
Whoa! They really built this place to last. No signs of structural damage. No cell signal either. It should be safe to set up. Let’s get the Animus down there.

Id: [0x000480A9]
It's my clothes.

Id: [0x000480AA]
They smell like you swam through a sewer.

Id: [0x000480AB]
You can change later. The van comes first.

Id: [0x000480AD]
Wait a second, guys. We need power down here. There's a line running nearby I can hook into but the wattage is weak.

Id: [0x000480AE]
Oh yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah. Anything else you two would like? You know, some caviar perhaps. Maybe you'd like me to knit you a lovely hat. No. Fine. Follow me.

Id: [0x000480BB]
I'm back.

Id: [0x000480BC]
Just in time. The sun's rising.

Id: [0x000480C0]
Did you miss me? No? Anyone? Hello, am I speaking out loud? Hello? Workaholics.

Id: [0x000480C2]
I smell terrible.

Id: [0x000480C3]
You're exaggerating.

Id: [0x000480C5]
Great. Ezio gets a bath with Caterina Sforza and I get a... swim in a toilet.

Id: [0x000480C7]
Something's opened.

Id: [0x000480C8]
Desmond?

Id: [0x000480C9]
That's a bad idea.

Id: [0x000480CA]
I could throw you into the air and you grab the ledge?

Id: [0x000480CB]
Even worse.

Id: [0x000480DA]
I'm stuck over here, but I can see a lever across the water.

Id: [0x000480DC]
There's another lever up ahead. Come over here.

Id: [0x000480E2]
About bloody time.

Id: [0x000480E5]
How about you give me a boost--

Id: [0x000480EE]
So, what do you think of Monteriggioni?

Id: [0x000480EF]
This is not Monteriggioni. Monteriggioni existed in the Renaissance. Ask me how the town was in 1554 when it was seized by Florence and I'll tell you.

Id: [0x000480F2]
Good, now select it and you're going to see the memories inside.

Id: [0x000480F5]
To stop your subconscious from rejecting Ezio's later memories you're going to have to live them in the order his genome recorded them.

Id: [0x000480F6]
Once you've unlocked a memory, by accessing this menu, you can relive it as many times as you want.

Id: [0x000480F8]
One last thing. As you raise your synchronization by executing events the way Ezio lived them, you might even discover some repressed memories.

Id: [0x000480FB]
Desmond, this is very important: if you need to take a break, log out of the Animus. You can leave the machine whenever you like.

Id: [0x000480FC]
I'm all set to go. Don't worry.

Id: [0x000480FD]
Okay, let's get started. Select the first memory.

Id: [0x00048100]
Where is Mario? I thought he would be waiting for us.

Id: [0x00048102]
The Borgia infantry are circling the town!

Id: [0x00048107]
I am here, Ezio.

Id: [0x00048109]
We could not leave without you.

Id: [0x0004810A]
The way out will be dangerous. [to Claudia] Protect our mother.

Id: [0x0004810C]
Can you show Desmond how to use these rerouters?

Id: [0x0004810E]
Right, look around Monteriggioni for circuit boxes. Rebecca's little doodads they'll reroute small amounts of electricity to the power line underneath the Villa. Don't ask me how they work, if I understood that, I wouldn't be the fellow hiding the van.

Id: [0x00048113]
Huh. I figured you'd like it nowadays. It seems not to have changed much.

Id: [0x00048114]
Exactly! History is the study of change. Change is life. When things become static, it means they're dead.

Id: [0x00048116]
What are we going to do about Abstergo?

Id: [0x00048119]
You know I love talking about this stuff Desmond, but we have work to do now.

Id: [0x0004811E]
Looks like something Ezio left behind. There are numbers underneath it: 1419, 1420 and 1421.

Id: [0x0004811F]
Wait it out. As soon as we find the Apple I get in contact with our other teams in Europe, but as far as Italy goes, we're on our own.

Id: [0x00048128]
The same man who brought me here gave me these clothes?

Id: [0x00048129]
Sì, Messere. (Yes, Mister.)

Id: [0x0004812A]
That should not be a problem. Vi ringrazio di tutto quello che avete fatto per me, buona donna. Addio. (Thank you very much for everything you have done for me. Farewell, good woman.)

Id: [0x0004812E]
I need to find a doctor.

Id: [0x0004812F]
Salute. (Hello.) I require medicine.

Id: [0x00048131]
The Vault did not house the terrible weapon we feared. This is good news!

Id: [0x00048132]
What of this goddess, this Minerva? Did she appear human?

Id: [0x00048133]
Yes, but her words proved otherwise. All of her kind died many years ago. I wish I could show you the magic she performed.

Id: [0x00048134]
Who is Desmond and where are these temples Minerva spoke of?

Id: [0x00048135]
I do not know.

Id: [0x00048136]
Perhaps we must search for them.

Id: [0x00048137]
Let me look.

Id: [0x00048139]
Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x0004813A]
Four out of five doctors would suggest leeches, but they have not proven effective against such things. However, I can recommend several good colleagues around the city. Do you need anything else?

Id: [0x0004813B]
"Someone my age." Imbecille. (Jerk.)

Id: [0x0004813D]
My back.

Id: [0x0004813F]
I do not recall such brave talk at Monteriggioni.

Id: [0x00048140]
How could I have known that they would find me so quickly? That they would kill Mario?

Id: [0x00048141]
I am improvising.

Id: [0x00048148]
Are you suggesting we appeal to the <br>people?

Id: [0x00048149]
Maybe.

Id: [0x0004814B]
Did Rodrigo manage to hurt you?

Id: [0x0004814C]
Barely, my armor blunted his attack.

Id: [0x00048150]
I did.

Id: [0x00048153]
Find me at the Terme (Baths)!

Id: [0x00048156]
This one was supposed to be legible. They are transmitting them using a code sheet. Without it, we have nothing.

Id: [0x00048157]
By using them, we can get to our destination rapidly without encountering resistance.

Id: [0x00048159]
Now, I propose we begin planning our assault on the Borgia.

Id: [0x0004815A]
Bene (good). Then, I am off to begin preparations for Romagna. Today Cesare commands my men, but soon, I hope, we will be free.

Id: [0x00048161]
Claudio! Get out.

Id: [0x00048162]
I can't!

Id: [0x00048163]
Stay there, I am coming!

Id: [0x00048168]
Quick! Hide from the guards.

Id: [0x00048169]
I cannot. They are going to kill me.

Id: [0x0004816A]
Pay attention. Do what I do.

Id: [0x0004816E]
Claudio!

Id: [0x00048170]
Molte grazie, Messere. (Thank you very much, Mister.)

Id: [0x00048171]
You know how to disappear.

Id: [0x00048173]
Ah. He is meeting someone in the Trastevere right now. Care to accompany me?

Id: [0x00048174]
I will follow...

Id: [0x0004817B]
What do you make of that?

Id: [0x0004817E]
Help!

Id: [0x0004817F]
Volpe, my son Claudio has been injured!

Id: [0x00048181]
They are going to shoot him.

Id: [0x00048183]
I will kill these. Go! Get the others.

Id: [0x00048184]
Keep out of sight for a while, intesi (understood)?

Id: [0x00048191]
Welcome, Ezio, to La Volpe Addormentata (The Sleeping Fox).

Id: [0x00048194]
The guild will be run from here.

Id: [0x00048198]
Visit me whenever you like. There might be objectives to pursue that will help our cause in the city.

Id: [0x000481A3]
Throw me Bianca!

Id: [0x000481AB]
Isn't she a thing of beauty?

Id: [0x000481AC]
Very impressive.

Id: [0x000481AD]
More men join us everyday. It has become very competitive, which is just the way I like it. As you can see, this board shows the ranks of our top warriors. Prove your skills and you will move up the list.

Id: [0x000481B4]
Hit me!

Id: [0x000481B5]
Doesn't this make you feel alive?

Id: [0x000481B6]
Come on.

Id: [0x000481B7]
That's it!

Id: [0x000481B9]
For the burning of your villa!

Id: [0x000481BA]
For your uncle!

Id: [0x000481BB]
For your brothers!

Id: [0x000481C5]
He has such an aggressive view of the world. However, strategy is equally important.

Id: [0x000481C7]
Take these carrier pigeons for example: Each one sent from Machiavelli bears the name of an important Templar in Roma. Eliminate them and you will have more of an impact than a battle ever could.

Id: [0x000481C8]
Thank you, Madonna (Madame). Can you ask Bartolomeo to come see me at Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island) with a report about Cesare and Rodrigo's whereabouts?

Id: [0x000481CF]
You can do better than that!

Id: [0x000481D0]
Make me feel it!

Id: [0x000481DB]
Welcome to the Rosa in Fiore (Blooming Rose), as you can see, the most popular brothel in Roma.

Id: [0x000481DC]
My money went well invested.

Id: [0x000481DE]
Here I keep a list of the skills taught to my girls.

Id: [0x000481E5]
I will keep that in mind. Anything else?

Id: [0x000481E6]
No. [beat] Ezio--

Id: [0x000481E7]
Did you find Caterina?

Id: [0x000481E8]
We are working on it.

Id: [0x000481E9]
Bene. (Good.) Come to see me at Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island) with her location.

Id: [0x000481EA]
Machiavelli. We must talk.

Id: [0x000481EB]
Yes. I secured something of great worth from one of my contacts. We now have the names of several Templar agents Cesare has recruited to terrorize Roma.

Id: [0x000481F1]
This information came from a city guard?

Id: [0x000481F2]
Yes. How did you know?

Id: [0x000481F3]
Lucky guess. Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x000481F4]
How do I find them?

Id: [0x000481F5]
I can give you a general location. I suggest looking for signs of distress nearby. Perhaps you will uncover citizens who can point you in the right direction. My contact will continue searching for more names.

Id: [0x000481F6]
Virtù (virtue)?

Id: [0x000481F8]
He will be there.

Id: [0x000481FB]
Ah yes, I forgot. We also have gambling. It is a great source of income, especially since we ensure that the Borgia guards always lose.

Id: [0x000481FD]
I shall.

Id: [0x00048200]
What have you discovered?

Id: [0x00048201]
That bastardo (bastard) Cesare is in the Castel Sant'Angelo with the Pope.

Id: [0x00048202]
My spies tell me that the Apple has been secreted to someone for study. I am working on determining his identity.

Id: [0x00048203]
Caterina will be moved to the prison within the Castello next week.

Id: [0x00048204]
Bene. (Good.) So the Castello it is. Roma will heal quickly with Cesare and Rodrigo gone.

Id: [0x00048209]
No, do not make the same mistake that you made in the Vault. You must kill them now.

Id: [0x0004820A]
Bene. [Good.] So the Castel it is.

Id: [0x0004820B]
Ah! Then you have come to your senses. With Cesare and Rodrigo gone, Roma will heal itself.

Id: [0x0004820C]
If the chance to assassinate them arises, I might take it.

Id: [0x0004820D]
Do not repeat your mistake in the Vault. You must kill them now.

Id: [0x0004820E]
I'm with Machiavelli, Ezio. We should not wait.

Id: [0x0004820F]
Bartolomeo is right.

Id: [0x00048210]
They must pay for Mario's death.

Id: [0x00048211]
Do not worry. They will die. You have my word.

Id: [0x00048213]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00048215]
They must not see us.

Id: [0x00048217]
When do we know if we have flanked them?

Id: [0x00048218]
You will hear the gunfire.

Id: [0x0004821D]
Use the trees for cover.

Id: [0x0004821E]
Good people of Roma, stay strong! You will be free, your time will come, I swear it!

Id: [0x0004821F]
Open the gate! The Captain General is leaving for Urbino!

Id: [0x00048221]
I got it. Here.

Id: [0x00048222]
Thanks.

Id: [0x00048224]
All right, stay here. That key is as good as mine.

Id: [0x00048225]
I am not going anywhere.

Id: [0x00048228]
What was that?

Id: [0x00048229]
I am late for rehearsal. Farewell, my love.

Id: [0x00048230]
Take care of her.

Id: [0x00048234]
Ezio! Come here.

Id: [0x00048235]
Very...very little.

Id: [0x00048236]
Agostino Chigi is the Pope's money-lender, but Cesare does business with someone else. As of now, all we know is that he is called The Banker.

Id: [0x00048239]
Montréal.

Id: [0x0004823A]
Open the gates!

Id: [0x0004823C]
The wages of all my men shall be yours. Let me go.

Id: [0x0004824E]
We'll talk later. Now, get in there and find the Apple. We're counting on you.

Id: [0x0004824F]
You seem focused.

Id: [0x00048250]
I've been busy patching new systems into Baby here. She's only gonna get better.

Id: [0x00048251]
Do you have any clue about those numbers under the drawing?

Id: [0x00048252]
1419, 1420, 1421. Maybe something to do with the Hundred Years War. Or wait...in 1419, Pope Martin V arrived in Florence right? He left for Rome in 1420, and that was the same year Brunelleschi began building the Duomo. And in 1421... in 1421. Yeah, I'll have to do some more research I think.

Id: [0x00048255]
You always a tech geek?

Id: [0x00048256]
Nah, I was into sports, but then I broke my leg and started playing with computers. Who knew that coding could be just as exhilarating as strapping on a board and dropping out of a helicopter?

Just FYI, you might want to get your adrenal glands checked. You know, because that, that is not normal.

Id: [0x00048263]
The decision is yours, not mine.

Id: [0x00048264]
Niccolò. You better not stop telling me what you think. Why else would I seek the opinion of my most trusted advisor?

Id: [0x0004826E]
You and I have not seen eye-to-eye on many issues.

Id: [0x0004826F]
Niccolò--

Id: [0x00048270]
But you were exactly what the Order needed. You have led the charge against the Templars and rebuilt this brotherhood.

Id: [0x00048271]
Now, we must put Ezio where he belongs, at the head of the Assassins.

Id: [0x00048273]
Ezio Auditore da Firenze. You will now be known as il Mentore (The Mentor), the guardian of our order and our secrets.

Id: [0x00048277]
Why the sudden change of heart?

Id: [0x00048278]
I have always stood by you. I was the one who brought you to Roma, and the one who caused the explosion as you fled the Castello. The mercenari (mercenaries) who protected you at il Colosseo (The Colosseum) were mine as well.

Id: [0x0004827D]
Where other men blindly follow the truth, remember...

Id: [0x0004827E]
Nothing is true.

Id: [0x0004827F]
Nothing is true.

Id: [0x00048280]
Nothing is true.

Id: [0x00048281]
Where other men are limited by morality and law, remember...

Id: [0x00048282]
Everything is permitted.

Id: [0x00048283]
Everything is permitted.

Id: [0x00048284]
Everything is permitted.

Id: [0x0004828E]
Maestro Machiavelli. Cesare has returned to Roma alone. He rides for the Castel Sant'Angelo.

Id: [0x0004828F]
Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x00048293]
Well?

Id: [0x00048294]
Go kill them, Mentore (Mentor). Finish what you started.

Id: [0x0004829A]
Good advice.

Id: [0x0004829D]
Volpe. How goes Roma?

Id: [0x0004829E]
Very well, Ezio. The French and Papal forces are in disarray.

Id: [0x0004829F]
Then it is almost time. Call the Assassins together and... bring Claudia.

Id: [0x000482A0]
Now?

Id: [0x000482A1]
Yes.

Id: [0x000482A2]
Laa shay'a waqi'un moutlaq bale kouloun moumkine. The wisdom of our Creed is revealed through these words.

Id: [0x000482A3]
We work in the dark, to serve the light. We are Assassins.

Id: [0x000482A5]
Claudia. We here dedicate our lives to protecting the freedom of humanity. Mario, our father and our brother once stood around this fire, fighting off the darkness. Now, I offer the choice to you. Join us.

Id: [0x000482AB]
We can't climb this.

Id: [0x000482AC]
Ezio!

Id: [0x000482B9]
I want to see the Pope!

Id: [0x000482BA]
His holiness waits for you at the top of the Castel, in his apartments.

Id: [0x000482BB]
Get out of my way!

Id: [0x00048309]
[small cough] I know...[small cough] I know where that bastard is going.

Id: [0x0004830B]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00048318]
What has happened here?

Id: [0x0004831A]
I do not know what you mean?

Id: [0x0004831B]
My funds, my troops. Gone.

Id: [0x0004831C]
Financial difficulties strike all of us, even those with an army.

Id: [0x0004831D]
You intend to give me money?

Id: [0x0004831E]
No, I do not.

Id: [0x00048320]
Then I will use the Piece of Eden to get what I want. Your help is not necessary.

Id: [0x00048322]
That has been made abundantly clear to me. Are you aware that the Baron de Valois is dead?

Id: [0x00048324]
No. Did you--

Id: [0x00048325]
What reason could I possibly have to kill him? Was he plotting against me with my "brilliant," traitorous, Captain General?

Id: [0x00048326]
I do not have to stand for this.

Id: [0x00048327]
The Assassins murdered him.

Id: [0x00048328]
Why did you not stop them?

Id: [0x0004832A]
You are not going anywhere. I have the Piece of Eden.

Id: [0x0004832B]
Get out of my way, old man.

Id: [0x0004832C]
I gave you everything and yet it's never enough!

Id: [0x00048335]
Stop! I know where it is.

Id: [0x00048337]
And you did not tell me he had taken it?

Id: [0x00048338]
[breath] Cesare...It's me...your queen.

Id: [0x0004833A]
You are my sister. Nothing more.

Id: [0x00048343]
Where is it?

Id: [0x00048345]
Where is the Apple?

Id: [0x00048347]
Tell me.

Id: [0x00048348]
As if I could. It was not my decision to attack Monteriggioni, it was yours! [beat] It is high time you took responsibility for your actions.

Id: [0x0004834A]
Cesare! He intends to poison you!

Id: [0x0004834B]
You would not listen to reason.

Id: [0x0004834D]
Father. Do you not see? I control all of this. If I want to live, I live. If I want to take, I take.

Id: [0x0004834F]
If I want you to die, you die!

Id: [0x00048351]
My accomplishments. Despite the constant interference of failures like you.

Id: [0x00048356]
Do not touch that!

Id: [0x00048358]
[Hi] Cesare.

Id: [0x00048359]
Such an unexpected surprise, this visit. I wonder, what brings you all the way to Roma?

Id: [0x0004835A]
I must discuss several matters with you of utmost importance.

Id: [0x0004835B]
Financial difficulties strike all of us, even those with an army. I sympathize.

Id: [0x0004835C]
So you intend to give me money?

Id: [0x0004835D]
No, I do not. Have an apple.

Id: [0x0004835F]
Then I will use the Piece of Eden to get what I want. I do not need your help.

Id: [0x00048361]
That has been made abundantly clear to me. Are you aware that the Baron de Valois is dead?

Id: [0x00048363]
No. Did you--

Id: [0x00048364]
What reason could I possibly have to kill him? Was he plotting against me with my brilliant, but naive, Captain General?

Id: [0x00048365]
I do not have to stand for this.

Id: [0x00048366]
Calm yourself. The Assassin killed him, as with Juan.

Id: [0x00048367]
Ezio? He is in Roma?

Id: [0x00048369]
You are not going anywhere. I have the Piece of Eden.

Id: [0x0004836A]
What do you want, old man?

Id: [0x0004836B]
The question is: what do YOU want? I have given you everything and yet it is never enough.

Id: [0x0004836C]
Calm down Cesare.

Id: [0x0004836D]
Darling sister. Stay out of this if you value your life. Give me the Apple.

Id: [0x0004836E]
The only apple you are going to get is this.

Id: [0x00048370]
No, father. That one's for you.

Id: [0x00048373]
[Chocking sounds]

Id: [0x00048374]
Stop it!

Id: [0x00048376]
Where is the Apple?

Id: [0x00048377]
Cesare...It's me...your queen.

Id: [0x00048379]
Mine. Nothing more. And I grow tired of you.

Id: [0x0004837A]
Those apples were poisoned.

Id: [0x0004837C]
Do you not see? I control all of this. If I want to live, I live. If I want to take, I take.

Id: [0x0004837E]
If I want you to die, you die.

Id: [0x00048381]
[moan]

Id: [0x00048382]
Where is the Apple?

Id: [0x00048384]
Where is it?

Id: [0x00048386]
Tell me.

Id: [0x00048389]
I know. I know where he is going.

Id: [0x0004838B]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00048398]
How did you even find it? Was it Lucrezia, that whore? No. Impossible. She knew nothing of its hiding place. Bah! Enough! It doesn't matter. Tell. Me. Where. It. Is!

Id: [0x00048399]
Be still, my son. And I will explain.

Id: [0x0004839A]
Oh, you will, father. Or you'll die.

Id: [0x0004839C]
Who are you to threaten me? I am the god-damned POPE.

Id: [0x0004839F]
Yes. For about another hour.

Id: [0x000483A1]
What have you done?

Id: [0x000483A2]
What should have been done YEARS ago.

Id: [0x000483A4]
Poison... What sort of monster would murder his own father?

Id: [0x000483A5]
I am as you made me.

Id: [0x000483A7]
Tell me where it is and the antidote is yours.

Id: [0x000483A9]
(Go to hell.)

Id: [0x000483AB]
[Laugh]

Id: [0x000483AC]
Fine. Die, then. I'll find it myself.

Id: [0x000483AF]
I had hoped you might come. You alone understand...

Id: [0x000483B0]
So you saw it too?

Id: [0x000483B2]
Once, the Templar cause gave meaning and purpose to my life. All undone with her words beneath the Vatican. With those terrible pictures. I knew emptiness then. All that I had worked for - believed in - was wrong. I am sorry for all I've done to you. I'd take everything back... if I could.

Id: [0x000483B4]
Then tell me Rodrigo, if you'd had a change of heart, why did you not stop your son?

Id: [0x000483B6]
I tried, I did. But Cesare would not listen. He said I was weak. Broken by my fight with you. That I'd given up. He was right.

Id: [0x000483B8]
I was turned me into a figurehead. I became a prisoner in my own home.

Id: [0x000483BA]
Family means nothing to him anymore. Even the cause is abandoned. He cares only for the Apple and its power.

Id: [0x000483BB]
To what end?

Id: [0x000483BC]
He will use it to unite all of Italia (Italy), as it was long ago. But peace is not his purpose.

Id: [0x000483BD]
He seeks to abolish the papacy and crown himself emperor! All will be made slaves.

Id: [0x000483BF]
Here. It will bring you to where I hid the Apple. Retrieve it. And once it's yours again -

Id: [0x000483C1]
- you must do what I could not -

Id: [0x000483C3]
You must kill my son.

Id: [0x000483C6]
I can ease your pain.

Id: [0x000483C7]
No. Don't. It... clarifies things. Let me sit with it a little while longer...

Id: [0x000483C9]
As you wish.

Id: [0x000483CA]
Video meliora proboque deteriora sequor. (I saw the better and acknowledged it, but I followed the worse...)

Id: [0x000483CE]
San Pietro (Saint Peters)... The pavilion in the courtyard. [cough]

Id: [0x000483E5]
Assassino! (Assassin!)

Id: [0x000483E6]
We could keep him on the run until Fabio arrives, if we knew his plans.

Id: [0x000483E7]
Maybe you can.

Id: [0x000483EF]
Guards!

Id: [0x000483F8]
The arco tolls.

Id: [0x000483F9]
Rodrigo Borgia is dead.

Id: [0x000483FA]
And Cesare?

Id: [0x000483FB]
Escaped.

Id: [0x000483FC]
We must not allow him to assemble his remaining supporters.

Id: [0x000483FE]
Fabio gathers his forces in Romagna. He intends to march on the city.

Id: [0x000483FF]
The next few weeks are critical. My spies cannot follow all leads and there is the chance Cesare will leave Roma to search for support in the countryside.

Id: [0x00048400]
The Borgia inventor?

Id: [0x00048401]
He works for me. Leonardo. Niccolò.

Id: [0x00048404]
What nice friends you have.

Id: [0x00048405]
He grows on you.

Id: [0x00048406]
With the Apple of Eden you can see Cesare's future.

Id: [0x00048408]
I have it.

Id: [0x00048409]
Then use it.

Id: [0x00048410]
Rodrigo Borgia is dead.

Id: [0x00048411]
And Cesare?

Id: [0x00048412]
Poisoned, but alive.

Id: [0x00048413]
We must not allow him to assemble his remaining supporters. The coming weeks are critical.

Id: [0x00048426]
With your aid I will hunt him down.

Id: [0x0004842A]
My men will patrol the city, but we might need an army.

Id: [0x0004842C]
We have one.

Id: [0x0004842F]
You must find them.

Id: [0x00048430]
They are everywhere and nowhere at once.

Id: [0x00048431]
I do not care how you do it.

Id: [0x00048432]
We cannot on our own, Signore (Sir). You must help us.

Id: [0x00048439]
You delude yourself, Cesare.

Id: [0x0004843A]
Guards!

Id: [0x0004843F]
A cardinal revealed under...stress that Cesare plans to meet with Templar loyalists in the countryside. The cardinal departs for the meeting tonight.

Id: [0x00048440]
I will follow him.

Id: [0x00048446]
Join me and I will take back Roma!

Id: [0x00048447]
We have decided to elect Della Rovere to the papacy. We are sorry.

Id: [0x00048448]
I paid for your appointment.

Id: [0x0004844E]
Assassino! (Assassin!) Run!

Id: [0x00048451]
Hired men promise you their blood, but as soon as you need help, they turn against you.

Id: [0x00048455]
Roma is not the same as it once was. Borgia money has become tainted.

Id: [0x00048456]
You will regret this decision.

Id: [0x00048457]
Guards!

Id: [0x0004845D]
My men tell me Cesare rallies his best soldiers in front of the main gate into Roma.

Id: [0x0004845E]
Gather the Assassins. We face him together.

Id: [0x00048464]
This is not your city anymore.

Id: [0x00048468]
Micheletto's troops mass behind me. We will take back my city once and for all!

Id: [0x0004846B]
By order of Pope Julius II, I arrest you, Cesare Borgia, for the crimes of murder, betrayal and incest.

Id: [0x0004846D]
Come to watch my triumph? Soon Micheletto and his army will arrive. But you shall be dead before then.

Id: [0x00048475]
I shall meet his challenge.

Id: [0x00048479]
My men will never fail me. They know what awaits them if they do.

Id: [0x0004847B]
Soon you will pass from this Earth and my dominions will be returned to me.

Id: [0x0004847D]
Kill him!

Id: [0x0004847F]
Rip the Assassin's throat out.

Id: [0x00048481]
I want the Assassin name to die today.

Id: [0x00048483]
Your uncle fought back. Look what happened to him.

Id: [0x00048484]
Throw down your arms, Cesare Borgia.

Id: [0x00048488]
No! No! No! No! This is not how it ends.

Id: [0x0004848D]
It was the manner in which he said it. "Chains will not hold me."

Id: [0x0004848E]
If you are so worried, there is a way to find out.

Id: [0x00048490]
No. It is too powerful. It must be hidden outside the domain of men.

Id: [0x00048493]
What a shame, hiding a masterpiece where no one will ever see it.

Id: [0x00048496]
And yet...what if he meant what he said?

Id: [0x00048498]
I cannot risk it.

Id: [0x000484A2]
Cesare was right. I have to leave.

Id: [0x000484A4]
What about your friends?

Id: [0x000484A5]
I built this brotherhood to last, with or without me.

Id: [0x000484A6]
If this is goodbye, then keep your money, I do not want it.

Id: [0x000484A8]
What do you intend to do?

Id: [0x000484A9]
Plant a seed.

Id: [0x00048502]
Ayúdenme. Mi hijo. Mi hijo está herido. (Help me. My son. My son is wounded.)

Id: [0x0004850A]
Cesare! The walls surround you. There is nowhere to run.

Id: [0x0004850B]
Come then, Ezio!

Id: [0x0004850C]
I cannot die. Fortuna (Fortune) will not fail me.

Id: [0x0004850F]
Retreat!

Id: [0x00048530]
¡Fuego! (Fire!)

Id: [0x00048541]
¡Déjame en paz! (Leave me alone!)

Id: [0x00048542]
I will not hurt you.

Id: [0x00048545]
That is my house. Por favor! (Please!)

Id: [0x00048547]
No!

Id: [0x0004854C]
Run! Run! [Laughs]

Id: [0x00048550]
You brought this upon yourselves through sin. This is how the Lord punishes you. Ours is a just God and this is justice. Praise the Lord! Thank you God for teaching us to be humble. To see our punishment for what it is, a call to spirituality. The Lord he giveth and the Lord he taketh away. So the truth is written. Amen!

Id: [0x00048565]
We've got it. The Colosseum.

Id: [0x00048566]
Let's go. We can be there before dawn.

Id: [0x00048567]
Wait. There was something about that door. I don't think I saw a handle. Let me run an analysis.

Id: [0x00048568]
Great. So we need some kind of futuristic key?

Id: [0x00048569]
It seems to open with a verbally triggered mechanism. I've never seen anything like it.

Id: [0x0004856A]
Try humming Beethoven's Fifth.

Id: [0x0004856C]
Damn European power grid. Now we can't scan Ezio's memories to find the password.

Id: [0x00048579]
Maybe Ezio left us some kind of visual hint?

Id: [0x0004857A]
Like a cheat guide for futuristic doors of the Renaissance?

Id: [0x0004857F]
This laptop runs on a battery. What's the date again?

Id: [0x00048580]
October tenth.

Id: [0x00048581]
Wasn't the tenth yesterday?

Id: [0x00048582]
No, Rebecca's right, it's the tenth.

Id: [0x00048583]
I'm not sure I trust a woman on this.

Id: [0x00048584]
What's that supposed to mean?

Id: [0x00048585]
You don't count. Only Lucy.

Id: [0x00048586]
I'm not a woman?

Id: [0x00048587]
Truthfully? No.

Id: [0x00048589]
How long do we have before the Templar satellite launch?

Id: [0x0004858A]
It's October 8th, so that leaves us with...74 days.

Id: [0x0004858B]
Not much time.

Id: [0x0004858C]
Think about all that you've been through in the last month. 74 days is a long time.

Id: [0x00048590]
Your ancestors have such interesting lives. I went in once. It was pretty lame.

Id: [0x00048591]
Yeah, what were you? Some kind of spinster probably?

Id: [0x00048592]
Worse. A Prussian mercenary. I spent hours firing guns. BORING.

Id: [0x00048593]
Yeah. Guns are for sissies.

Id: [0x00048594]
You ever used the Animus?

Id: [0x00048596]
Any good stories about Cesare?

Id: [0x00048597]
Are you kidding? He was notorious. Get this: in 1502, his top captains rebelled against him. He made concessions to all of them and they rejoined his army. Then, on New Year's Eve in 1503, he got them together inside a room in Sinigaglia. Everyone was arrested. Two were put back to back and strangled by Micheletto that very night. The rest were thrown into chains and...and killed a few weeks later.

Id: [0x00048598]
Wow.

Id: [0x00048599]
The amazing thing is that Cesare was so friendly during the months before, they never saw the trap coming. Machiavelli called him the master deceiver.

Id: [0x0004859B]
I'm kind of busy here.

Id: [0x0004859D]
There's no time to talk.

Id: [0x0004859F]
We have work to do.

Id: [0x000485A1]
Gotta stay with the code.

Id: [0x000485A3]
We'll talk later.

Id: [0x000485A5]
Focusing on this.

Id: [0x000485A7]
I'm busy right now.

Id: [0x000485A9]
My work requires attention, Desmond.

Id: [0x000485AE]
We have to find that password.

Id: [0x000485B0]
Ezio knows the answer. Problem is, he's dead.

Id: [0x000485B2]
I can't believe we're stuck here.

Id: [0x000485B3]
Hey. Maybe it has something to do with this.

Id: [0x000485B4]
The symbol matches the one on the door to the Vault.

Id: [0x000485B5]
1419, 1420, 1421...What if they aren't dates?

Id: [0x000485B7]
1419, 1420-- Oh my God.

Id: [0x000485B8]
What?

Id: [0x000485B9]
God.

Id: [0x000485BA]
Tell us already!

Id: [0x000485BB]
I am, I am. The Tetragrammaton. The 72 names of God. You see? They're all contained within three verses. Exodus 19 through 21. And, get this, you'll like this, if you arrange the four Hebrew letters in God's name within an equilateral triangle [he points to the triangle], their numerical values add up to the same number: 72.

Id: [0x000485BD]
So?

Id: [0x000485BE]
Guess how many days there are until the Templar satellite launch?

Id: [0x000485BF]
I have a feeling I know the answer: 72.

Id: [0x000485C0]
I think we have our password.

Id: [0x000485C1]
Shaun, go get the van.

Id: [0x000485C4]
Let's go.

Id: [0x000485C6]
Ha! Yeah, nice try. I've seen your car.

Id: [0x000485C8]
Déjà vu.

Id: [0x000485C9]
I bet.

Id: [0x000485CE]
We commit to this space the epilogue of our ending. Let it be found by he who is deemed worthy. Let it guide him. Let it shape his path forward. Let it save the world we leave behind.

Id: [0x000485D5]
I'm coming.

Id: [0x000485D7]
Took you long enough.

Id: [0x000485D8]
Santa Maria Aracoeli. See those columns along the aisles? They're lifted from Roman ruins. Now, supposedly, this church was built on top of the ancient Temple of Juno.

Id: [0x000485D9]
I like the ceiling.

Id: [0x000485DA]
You like the ceiling. Oh well, you are a fascinating travelling companion.

Id: [0x000485DC]
Oh well, we'll just stay down here then shall we...and just pray or something.

Id: [0x000485DE]
Here goes.

Id: [0x000485E3]
I'm not so sure--

Id: [0x000485E6]
Yeah, if you want to kill us mate, you're going have to try a little harder than that.

Id: [0x000485F0]
I've waited so long for this.

Id: [0x000485F6]
Do you think it speaks English?

Id: [0x000485F7]
Just say it.

Id: [0x000485F8]
Okay...seventy-two.

Id: [0x000485FC]
This is amazing.

Id: [0x000485FD]
I'm actually impressed.

Id: [0x00048602]
Did you hear any of that?

Id: [0x00048603]
Any of what, Desmond?

Id: [0x0004860E]
No matter what you do, I will conquer all.

Id: [0x00048612]
Wanting something does not make it your right.

Id: [0x00048615]
What do you know?

Id: [0x00048616]
That a true leader empowers the people he rules.

Id: [0x00048617]
I will lead mankind into a new world!

Id: [0x00048618]
You cannot kill me. No man can murder me!

Id: [0x0004861D]
Che nessuno ricordi il tuo nome. (May no one remember your name.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x00048622]
Give up, Auditore. You are no match for me.

Id: [0x00048624]
I will hunt and kill all the people you hold dear.

Id: [0x0004867F]
Tell Claudia that the Banker is here.

Id: [0x00048687]
Where is the Piece of Eden?

Id: [0x0004868A]
You...never loved me?

Id: [0x0004868D]
Tell me!

Id: [0x0004868F]
Nothing is true.

Id: [0x00048690]
Everything is permitted.

Id: [0x00048694]
Did you hear, Egidio wants to get rid of the exemption licenses.

Id: [0x00048695]
Please. Every citizen who feels mistreated by our laws should be allowed to pay for an exemption to those laws. Such is our duty, as Gesù Cristo (Jesus Christ) said: "Blessed are the merciful."

Id: [0x00048697]
Why would we give our money to Egidio? We know what he intends to do with it.

Id: [0x000486A0]
The pezzo di merda (piece of shit) may hate me, but he's still family. Va bene (okay), we go.

Id: [0x000486A1]
Have you heard anything about my brother, Francesco?

Id: [0x000486A2]
Cesare is dealing with him.

Id: [0x000486A3]
I hope he's all right.

Id: [0x000486A5]
So what are you going to do with my money?

Id: [0x000486A6]
The Banker likes to treat his friends well.

Id: [0x000486A7]
How generous he is.

Id: [0x000486A8]
What did you say?

Id: [0x000486A9]
Nothing.

Id: [0x000486AA]
I better not lose sight of the money.

Id: [0x000486AD]
The count is complete?

Id: [0x000486B0]
Ser (Sir) Luigi, respectfully, we must take this chest to the banker on time.

Id: [0x000486B2]
I am not questioning your authority...but should we not get going?

Id: [0x000486B4]
Is this some kind of test?

Id: [0x000486B5]
Not sure.

Id: [0x000486B7]
Perhaps we're too early for the banker?

Id: [0x000486B9]
Signore (Sir), are you all right?

Id: [0x000486BA]
Soon we will be there.

Id: [0x000486BB]
I hope they let us go inside.

Id: [0x000486BC]
I do not know where he is leading us. This makes me wish I were still a blacksmith.

Id: [0x000486BD]
You were terrible at it.

Id: [0x000486BE]
I know, but at least I did not have to walk anywhere.

Id: [0x000486C3]
I can protect you.

Id: [0x000486C4]
I bet. That is quite a chest you have there.

Id: [0x000486C8]
What will I tell the Priest in confession?

Id: [0x000486DA]
Assassino! (Assassin!)

Id: [0x000486DC]
Stay back!

Id: [0x000486DD]
Cesare will never let you live.

Id: [0x00048712]
I don't understand. I ordered a fresh batch of la cantarella last night.

Id: [0x00048713]
I am terribly sorry, mia Signora (My Lady), but the Pope has taken it all.

Id: [0x00048714]
Where is the Pope?

Id: [0x00048715]
He meets with Cesare.

Id: [0x00048716]
Strange. He did not tell me Cesare had returned.

Id: [0x00048731]
I intend to write a book about you one day.

Id: [0x00048732]
If you do, make it short.

Id: [0x00048756]
No?

Id: [0x00048758]
I will keep our secret.

Id: [0x0004875C]
Lucrezia. Your lips call to me.

Id: [0x0004875D]
I heard the entire exchange, mia Signora (My Lady), and can vouch for it.

Id: [0x0004875E]
Good. Tell Cesare. We shall see how it feels when the shoe is on the other foot.

Id: [0x0004875F]
Yes, Signora (My Lady).

Id: [0x00048761]
I hope you have treated our guest with kindness.

Id: [0x00048764]
You want me to ask it?

Id: [0x00048765]
Or think it or something.

Id: [0x00048768]
You sure you asked it the right thing?

Id: [0x0004876A]
Do you have proof?

Id: [0x0004876B]
No.

Id: [0x00048773]
Who told them?

Id: [0x00048774]
Maestro (Master) Machiavelli asked about our search for Pietro earlier today.

Id: [0x00048779]
I seek Pietro.

Id: [0x0004877A]
He acts onstage, Signore (Sir). One of my men will take you to him.

Id: [0x0004877B]
I must get to Pietro before he does.

Id: [0x0004877C]
Il Colosseo (The Colosseum).

Id: [0x0004877E]
Jesus, much have I heard spake of thee, that sick and blind through thy pity thou has healed before in this city as thee has healed me today. Thee will I serve and with thee be, for well I leave in days three thou will rise. Lord, I thee pray.

Id: [0x0004877F]
Ah, lord God, what heart have ye to slay this man that I here see dead, hanging, that never yet did amiss? For, surely, God's son is he. Therefore a tomb is made for me therein his body buried shall be, for he is king of bliss.

Id: [0x00048780]
Sir Joseph, I say surely, this is God's son almighty. Go ask Pilate for his body, and buried shall he be. I shall help thee to take him down devotedly.

Id: [0x00048781]
Sir Pilate, special I thee pray a boon thou grant me as thou may. This prophet that is dead today, thou grant me his body.

Id: [0x00048782]
Joseph, all ready, in good faith! If that Centurion says that he is dead, him will I not deny. (yelled) Centurion, is Jesus dead?

Id: [0x00048783]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x00048786]
Don't forget, I wear the black shirt. Protect me and wait for Pilate's call to the Centurion to strike.

Id: [0x00048794]
I am once again in your debt, Ezio.

Id: [0x00048797]
Really?

Id: [0x00048799]
I heard the Colosseum Passion Play took an unexpected turn this evening.

Id: [0x0004879A]
It seems Gesù Cristo (Jesus Christ) was resurrected three days early.

Id: [0x000487AD]
Looking for this?

Id: [0x000487AE]
It ends now, Assassino (Assassin). My sword will take your life.

Id: [0x000487AF]
What sorcery is this?

Id: [0x000487B0]
He has God on his side!

Id: [0x000487B1]
Please Lord, do not smite me!

Id: [0x000487B2]
How is this possible?

Id: [0x000487B4]
Il Diavolo (The Devil)!

Id: [0x000487B9]
All of Italia shall be united and you will rule beside me.

Id: [0x000487BD]
Here. A gift.

Id: [0x000487C2]
And take the money. On your meager salary you will need it.

Id: [0x000487C3]
My patron has been arrested after all.

Id: [0x000487C4]
We will see each other again, you have my word. Buona fortuna, (good luck) my oldest friend.

Id: [0x000487D3]
Then I leave you in the hands of Fate.

Id: [0x000487D9]
Take that!

Id: [0x000487DF]
I am the best fighter who ever lived.

Id: [0x000487E0]
Defeat will never taint me.

Id: [0x000487E1]
An Auditore will never best me.

Id: [0x000487E2]
Stay back!

Id: [0x000487E3]
Roma, Italia, España, they will all be mine.

Id: [0x0004880A]
Desmond. I've been looking at those gibberish five-digit codes from the end of Subject 16's files and I seem to have discovered a remarkable coincidence. The codes correspond perfectly with coordinates inside the Animus.

Id: [0x0004880C]
I've marked the quadrants on your map. There are ten. Maybe nothing's there, but who knows?

Id: [0x00048812]
What's that?

Id: [0x00048816]
Lucy? Rebecca? Where is everybody?

Id: [0x00048819]
You dropped out of the grid. Where were you?

Id: [0x0004881A]
Not sure. Some kind of fragmented memory?

Id: [0x0004881B]
Maybe you should stop.

Id: [0x0004881C]
I'm good. I want to keep going.

Id: [0x0004881F]
I'll put 16's video files here. Hopefully, they'll begin to make sense as you free up each file.

Id: [0x00048824]
There's nothing here.

Id: [0x00048825]
Strange. I'm seeing a massive amount of data.

Id: [0x00048826]
What does he mean "The miracle is in the execution?"

Id: [0x00048827]
He's playing with us...unless--

Id: [0x00048828]
...it isn't a video! Hang on.

Id: [0x0004882A]
I don't know. Some kind of commentary on nihilism?

Id: [0x0004882E]
Desmond, it seems to be taking you out--

Id: [0x00048830]
Rebecca? Lucy?

Id: [0x00048833]
Hello?

Id: [0x0004883B]
Subject 16?

Id: [0x0004883C]
[Laughs] Yes, Subject 17.

Id: [0x0004883D]
You're dead. I saw your blood.

Id: [0x0004883E]
No time. It is far later than you know. Too late to save them.

Id: [0x00048842]
Who?

Id: [0x00048843]
She is not who you think she is. Everything you hope to become, everything you hold dear. It's already gone.

Id: [0x00048844]
Explain. Please.

Id: [0x00048846]
I cannot...The sun...Your son...Too weak...Must replenish energy...

Id: [0x00048849]
Don't go.

Id: [0x0004884A]
I am with you until the end. Find me in the darkness.

Id: [0x0004884C]
Desmond! You're safe. We thought we'd lost you.

Id: [0x0004884D]
I'm here. I saw 16, I think. I don't know whether it actually happened. It feels like a dream.

Id: [0x00048852]
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now. The Animus is behaving normally.

Id: [0x00048854]
Take a break before going back in there, okay?

Id: [0x0004885B]
Sorry for frightening you.

Id: [0x0004885C]
Don't worry about me.

Id: [0x0004885D]
Okay.

Id: [0x00048860]
When you're ready, let's continue.

Id: [0x00048877]
La mia gamba. (My leg.)

Id: [0x00048878]
Come mother. Walk with me.

Id: [0x00048882]
Soldati! (Soldiers!) I have found an entrance!

Id: [0x00048884]
I will hold them here. Claudia, get mother across!

Id: [0x00048888]
Ezio! We are on the other side. Hurry!

Id: [0x0004888D]
Cazzo! (Fuck!)

Id: [0x0004888F]
Dio mi salvi! (God save me!)

Id: [0x00048894]
We can't jump this.

Id: [0x00048895]
I have an idea. You'll have to help me. Stand at the edge and get ready.

Id: [0x00048897]
Ready.

Id: [0x00048899]
Made it!

Id: [0x000488A0]
Nice work.

Id: [0x000488A9]
The Borgia have taken everything.

Id: [0x000488AA]
Mario will stop them, you'll see.

Id: [0x000488AB]
Come Claudia. Walk faster.

Id: [0x000488AD]
Let me help you with her, Signore (Sir).

Id: [0x000488AE]
Please, do not call me that anymore.

Id: [0x000488B7]
I need munitions.

Id: [0x000488B9]
Help yourself! There are more than enough to go around.

Id: [0x000488BC]
Faster to travel by horse.

Id: [0x000488C3]
Good one!

Id: [0x000488C5]
Jump!

Id: [0x000488CD]
Machiavelli. It is done.

Id: [0x000488CF]
Get inside the Sanctuary.

Id: [0x000488D1]
I will hold them back!

Id: [0x000488D3]
Hurry, Ezio.

Id: [0x000488DF]
Wait. We're at the Auditore Villa?

Id: [0x000488E0]
Yes. It's our last safehouse in Italy. It turns out the Templars are watching the border.

Id: [0x000488E1]
Ezio hid the P.O.E. sometime in 1507, but when I try to access that DNA sequence, he seems to be...remembering something else.

Id: [0x000488E2]
Like a memory inside a memory?

Id: [0x000488E3]
Yes. Exactly. [pause] Maybe.

Id: [0x000488E4]
Exactly maybe?

Id: [0x000488E5]
I believe you experienced something similar back at Abstergo, didn't you?

Id: [0x000488E6]
Subject 15 exhibited memory-within-memory-like-patterns, but she was pregnant. The memories of both the fetus's father and mother were competing.

Id: [0x000488E7]
Desmond's not pregnant. At least, as far as I can tell. Might have just had a big lunch.

Id: [0x000488E8]
Can you skip ahead to a later memory?

Id: [0x000488E9]
No, it doesn't work.

Id: [0x000488EA]
Well that sounds familiar. We couldn't access Altair's later memories until Desmond had improved his synchronization.

Id: [0x000488EB]
Then it's possible something similar has occurred here. Ezio's troubled state is being transposed onto Desmond, destabilizing the memory.

Id: [0x000488ED]
Either that, or Rebecca's just not a very good engineer.

Id: [0x000488EE]
Thanks, asshole.

Id: [0x000488EF]
What? I'm simply listing possible explanations. And that is amongst the most likely. Touchy...

Id: [0x000488F0]
This place isn’t secure. Cell phone surveillance can see right through the walls.

Id: [0x000488F1]
Don't you mean satellite surveillance?

Id: [0x000488F2]
Are you kidding? Abstergo upgraded to cell towers ages ago. The waves go through everything above ground. They're gonna find us.

Id: [0x000488F3]
No they aren’t. Come with me.

Id: [0x0004890E]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00048910]
Desmond, that was... pretty awesome.

Id: [0x00048911]
It just felt natural. We can get in through here.

Id: [0x00048912]
Follow you where?

Id: [0x00048914]
Are we going somewhere?

Id: [0x00048918]
Why won't this turn on...

Id: [0x00048919]
Good job.

Id: [0x00048920]
It was Lucy's idea.

Id: [0x00048921]
Oi! You can probably use Eagle Vision to find the boxes.

Id: [0x00048922]
I bet I can use Eagle Vision to find the boxes.

Id: [0x0004892A]
We going to get any food in here?

Id: [0x0004892B]
People who don't work, don't eat.

Id: [0x00048937]
Is Desmond going to be able to relive memories this time?

Id: [0x00048938]
As a matter of fact, he will.

Id: [0x00048945]
And the Mausoleo?

Id: [0x00048947]
How about from the top of that church?

Id: [0x00048949]
Yes, but the stairs up are closed.

Id: [0x0004894D]
Someone your age cannot recover from a wound like this with medicine. Here is something to dull the pain, you will heal over time.

Id: [0x00048962]
Ezio, what a surprise to see you here.

Id: [0x00048963]
I thought you had sent for me?

Id: [0x00048964]
Never. News of the Villa attack has spread across the city. We were certain that you were dead.

Id: [0x00048965]
Not yet. I am still very much alive.

Id: [0x00048968]
Follow me. Take care not to draw any undue attention.

Id: [0x00048969]
When do I ever?

Id: [0x0004896A]
You would be wise to purchase missing equipment. You will not live long in Roma without supplies.

Id: [0x0004896B]
I have my blade.

Id: [0x0004896C]
And the guards have their guns, courtesy of the Borgia. Fortunately, I can help you.

Id: [0x0004896E]
While you are in my debt, perhaps you will listen to reason.

Id: [0x0004896F]
As soon as I hear some, I will let you know.

Id: [0x00048970]
The Borgia must not discover that you escaped them.

Id: [0x00048974]
He knows neither danger nor fatigue. Those who do not fall by his sword clamor to join his ranks. The powerful Orsini and Colonna families have been brought to kneel at his feet and the King of France stands at his side.

Id: [0x00048978]
Should we not travel by horse? Roma is quite large.

Id: [0x0004897A]
Do not play dumb with me, Machiavelli.

Id: [0x0004897C]
Just because you kill a few guards does not mean the people will grant access to the stables.

Id: [0x0004897D]
You are right. We need to send a signal. Wait here.

Id: [0x0004897F]
It seems the stable is now available for purchase.

Id: [0x00048982]
After you.

Id: [0x000489A3]
Give me back my money!

Id: [0x000489A4]
Come back here!

Id: [0x000489A5]
You are making a big mistake!

Id: [0x000489A7]
Look at these facades masquerading as government. The Pope is very clever to keep this place in business. It fools your friends the people quite easily.

Id: [0x000489AC]
Sì. (Yes.)

Id: [0x000489AD]
Do you know, for instance, where the Borgia troops took Caterina Sforza?

Id: [0x000489B3]
We need to make sure the Borgia stay away. Perhaps it could look like an inn.

Id: [0x000489B4]
Yes. Hmm, I like that idea.

Id: [0x000489B5]
So what of the thieves?

Id: [0x000489B7]
We had plans to repair this old building, but, now that you and I are working together, I would like to know what you think.

Id: [0x000489B8]
Then I will make it so.

Id: [0x000489BA]
I see you thieves compete against each other.

Id: [0x000489BB]
You can participate, if you wish. Perhaps you will show them a thing or two.

Id: [0x000489BD]
Pantasilea! Pantasilea! Where is she?

Id: [0x000489BF]
For your father!

Id: [0x000489C0]
Let out your anger!

Id: [0x000489C1]
Now for the best part, the fights downstairs.

Id: [0x000489C3]
This is where we get ready for battle. Nothing like fighting to build up rage in order to take vengeance. Then we go out there and unleash it on those sissy Frenchmen. Come on, Ezio. Let's see what you can do!

Id: [0x000489C4]
Me?

Id: [0x000489C5]
No, the other Ezio. Get in here.

Id: [0x000489C7]
I am waiting, Madonna [Madame].

Id: [0x000489CA]
I've had enough.

Id: [0x000489CC]
Come back if you ever want to let off more steam.

Id: [0x000489CE]
Gian's fighting downstairs!

Id: [0x000489CF]
If you're looking to show off, we also have fights. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got money on this match. [Laugh]

Id: [0x000489D1]
Ezio. (beat) You have been fighting.

Id: [0x000489D2]
Bartolomeo took me downstairs.

Id: [0x000489D3]
Where is Bartolomeo?

Id: [0x000489D4]
At the fight downstairs.

Id: [0x000489D5]
[Very short laugh] Shouldn't I already be at the top?

Id: [0x000489D7]
Let her go.

Id: [0x000489DA]
What alternative do you have, Ezio?

Id: [0x000489DB]
Ezio, the Borgia make it difficult for Claudia's girls. There are several things you could do that would aid them...

Id: [0x000489DC]
You are not teaching them much.

Id: [0x000489DD]
Think you could do better?

Id: [0x000489DE]
Nessun problema. (No problem.)

Id: [0x000489FD]
Keep moving, we must flank them.

Id: [0x000489FE]
De acuerdo. (Fine.)

Id: [0x00048A02]
The same will happen to any who defy us!

Id: [0x00048A08]
The women were forbidden to marry and the family tombstones were erased. Wiped from the history books. Poof. Just like that.

Id: [0x00048A0B]
Don't you dare.

Id: [0x00048A10]
Figlio di puttana (Son of a whore).

Id: [0x00048A12]
Never do that to me again.

Id: [0x00048A16]
Then you leave me no choice.

Id: [0x00048A17]
I bet you think you're doing great things, charging around killing whomever you wish.

Id: [0x00048A18]
The ignorant make easy targets.

Id: [0x00048A19]
Go, my son, destroy them...but remember for whom we Assassins fight.

Id: [0x00048A1D]
Cesare will grant me Italie, as I am of the house of Valois. I shall rule as befits my birthright.

Id: [0x00048A1E]
The Borgia try to overturn the natural order. I intend to set it right again. Royal blood must rule, not their foul taint.

Id: [0x00048A1F]
Are you nothing more than a barbarian like the rest of them?

Id: [0x00048A20]
I will do anything you want.

Id: [0x00048A24]
How did you find me?

Id: [0x00048A25]
--Mario Auditore led me here.

Id: [0x00048A27]
How did you find me?

Id: [0x00048A28]
The Apple you stole from Mario Auditore led me here.

Id: [0x00048A2A]
Stay with mother and be careful!

Id: [0x00048A2E]
All right. I have a plan to deal with the Borgia.

Id: [0x00048A2F]
We can either go after supplies or Cesare's followers.

Id: [0x00048A32]
Ezio! I just heard the most wonderful news. Cesare's banker, has been killed. It seems Cesare's battle funds are in shambles.

Id: [0x00048A33]
What a surprise.

Id: [0x00048A34]
You did not have anything to do with this, did you?

Id: [0x00048A35]
Do you really want to know?

Id: [0x00048A36]
On second thought, let's stick with the inventions.

Id: [0x00048A38]
Strange news, Ezio. Did you hear Pietro, Lucrezia's lover, fled the city after being poisoned by Micheletto at the Colosseum passion play?

Id: [0x00048A39]
No. But...was he saved by a hooded man?

Id: [0x00048A3A]
You daring figlio d'un cane (son of a bitch).

Id: [0x00048A3B]
Shhh. I heard nothing, remember?

Id: [0x00048A3E]
Ezio. The French are pulling out of Roma! The Baron de Valois was found murdered within his own camp.

Id: [0x00048A3F]
Could it have been an Assassin?

Id: [0x00048A40]
There are rumors which favor such a theory.

Id: [0x00048A41]
Never listen to gossip, Leonardo. It could get you into trouble.

Id: [0x00048A42]
Good advice.

Id: [0x00048A44]
Ezio. The papal apartments are in turmoil. Cesare is ill and the Pope, dead. It was your doing, was it not?

Id: [0x00048A45]
Leonardo, I swear to you, he did not die by my hand.

Id: [0x00048A46]
This world gets stranger every day. I shall have to focus on my painting. I work on the small portrait of a woman. I am growing rather fond of it.

Id: [0x00048A47]
Do not let a beautiful girl distract you from constructing my designs.

Id: [0x00048A48]
Have no worries. Women provide little distraction.

Id: [0x00048A4B]
I entered il Vaticano (The Vatican) and faced Rodrigo. He used the power of the papal staff against me, but I defeated him. Combining the Staff and the Apple, I gained access to the Vault. There, a moving painting of the goddess Minerva spoke. She told of a terrible tragedy to befall mankind in the future, but gave hope of lost temples that will provide aid to humanity. And then she called out to a phantom, Desmond, as if he were there, standing beside me. After her warning, she vanished.

Id: [0x00048A4D]
Come on, Ezio!

Id: [0x00048A4E]
Protect me!

Id: [0x00048A4F]
Help me!

Id: [0x00048A5B]
Bene. (Good.) I will follow up on that lead.

Id: [0x00048A5C]
French soldiers are guarding the road back into the Castello. Once Cesare arrives, you will never get to him.

Id: [0x00048A5D]
I intend to kill the French general. With him dead, Bartolomeo will have the Frenchmen on the defensive and they will abandon their posts on the bridge.

Id: [0x00048A5E]
Come see me later, I will have my thieves ascertain his location.

Id: [0x00048A63]
You spoke of a Senator at the meeting.

Id: [0x00048A64]
Find him on the Campidoglio, you do not need me.

Id: [0x00048A65]
Some proposal to diminish the frequency of public executions.

Id: [0x00048A66]
Egidio's petitioning for an end to witness torture in the criminal courts.

Id: [0x00048A67]
Like that's going to happen. He just wants the money to pay off his debts.

Id: [0x00048A68]
I know a place.

Id: [0x00048A69]
You're going to have to protect me though. The guards aren't being very friendly, if you know what I mean.

Id: [0x00048A71]
I better get in there.

Id: [0x00048A77]
Lucky you.

Id: [0x00048A78]
Where did I put my coin purse?

Id: [0x00048A7A]
Not mine.

Id: [0x00048A7B]
On the contrary. I watched you steal my guard's money. I believe I've earned a free ride as repentance. In fact, I want you here all night long.

Id: [0x00048A7C]
For free? I have to make money you know.

Id: [0x00048A7D]
Do you have a sister by any chance?

Id: [0x00048A7E]
No, but I have a daughter.

Id: [0x00048A7F]
300 florins?

Id: [0x00048A80]
700.

Id: [0x00048A81]
Done! A pleasure doing business with you.

Id: [0x00048A83]
I better follow him.

Id: [0x00048A84]
Cesare's time will come. Now, for the Banker.

Id: [0x00048A85]
Ooh. Bellissima. (Beautiful.)

Id: [0x00048A86]
Spread your legs.

Id: [0x00048A87]
Do you not think her breasts are superb?

Id: [0x00048A88]
Come here, my dear.

Id: [0x00048A8B]
Oh yes. That's nice.

Id: [0x00048A8D]
Someone. Take her away.

Id: [0x00048A93]
We came back with the money. They followed us home.

Id: [0x00048A94]
Where are Claudia and Maria?

Id: [0x00048A9A]
What do you want?

Id: [0x00048A9B]
Once I kill the Banker, your girls must take his money back to the underground.

Id: [0x00048A9C]
Fine.

Id: [0x00048A9E]
Stay alert.

Id: [0x00048AA4]
Without Volpe's thieves, I may require the help of my recruits.

Id: [0x00048AA6]
Desmond, you can't synch with this memory yet. Ezio seems to have done more with his recruits.

Id: [0x00048AB2]
Give him a moment.

Id: [0x00048AB3]
Leeches will lead to a full recovery.

Id: [0x00048AB4]
I cannot thank you enough I--

Id: [0x00048AB6]
If you don't, I will.

Id: [0x00048AB8]
What is this place?

Id: [0x00048AB9]
No more arguing.

Id: [0x00048ABD]
They're coming from the other side!

Id: [0x00048ABE]
The other entrance!

Id: [0x00048ABF]
They come again. Bianca thirsts for French blood.

Id: [0x00048AC0]
We are surrounded!

Id: [0x00048AC2]
Ezio, shut the gates!

Id: [0x00048AC3]
The gates!

Id: [0x00048AC4]
Secure the barracks!

Id: [0x00048AC5]
Close the gates!

Id: [0x00048AC6]
Defend the other entrance!

Id: [0x00048AC8]
The Baron de Valois signals from the field!

Id: [0x00048AC9]
Nothing hangs between your thighs. In fact, there is a hole there so deep it reaches into the maledetto inferno (fucking underworld)!

Id: [0x00048ACA]
I will get you pezzo di merda figlio di puttana (you piece of shit son of a bitch)!

Id: [0x00048ACC]
Maybe this is the end. I enter at dawn bearing gifts and hope that coward spares her life.

Id: [0x00048ACE]
Get into formation!

Id: [0x00048AD1]
More troops up ahead!

Id: [0x00048AD2]
I will take care of them.

Id: [0x00048AD3]
Stop them before they attack us.

Id: [0x00048ADE]
Nothing is true.

Id: [0x00048AE0]
Everything is permitted.

Id: [0x00048AE6]
Our camp is under attack!

Id: [0x00048AE7]
Bartolomeo d'Alviano will feel the wrath of the French!

Id: [0x00048AE8]
Oui (Yes), this is shit.

Id: [0x00048AEA]
Who is going to lead us now?

Id: [0x00048AED]
Merda! (Shit!) Close the gate! Close the gate!

Id: [0x00048AEF]
Faster!

Id: [0x00048AF1]
Madre di Dio! (Mother of God!)

Id: [0x00048AF3]
Il mondo è migliore senza di te. (The world is better without you.)

Id: [0x00048AF5]
That woman gives me so much trouble.

Id: [0x00048AF6]
Why didn't I stay in the stables?

Id: [0x00048AF7]
What a family this Pope has.

Id: [0x00048AFC]
I want the Apple!

Id: [0x00048AFF]
Am I hurting you?

Id: [0x00048B01]
Give me the Apple!

Id: [0x00048B02]
It's mine, not yours!

Id: [0x00048B05]
Smart decision, little sister.

Id: [0x00048B07]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x00048B08]
Cazzo. (Fuck.)

Id: [0x00048B0A]
I will come for you later.

Id: [0x00048B0B]
You?!

Id: [0x00048B0F]
GUARDS! GUARDS!

Id: [0x00048B11]
I am ill, you idioti (idiots). Micheletto will soon be here with my armies and then you will see how quickly the Assassini (Assassins) fall.

Id: [0x00048B13]
Insieme per la vittoria!

Id: [0x00048B15]
Vittoria agli Assassini!

Id: [0x00048B16]
Vittoria agli Assassini!

Id: [0x00048B17]
Vittoria agli Assassini!

Id: [0x00048B18]
Vittoria agli Assassini!

Id: [0x00048B19]
Vittoria agli Assassini!

Id: [0x00048B1C]
Chains will not hold me. I will not die by the hand of man.

Id: [0x00048B23]
Kill him! Kill the assassin! Tear the maldito bastardo (old fucker) to pieces!

Id: [0x00048B39]
I need munitions.

Id: [0x00048B3B]
Help yourself! There are more than enough to go around.

Id: [0x00048B3E]
Faster to travel by horse.

Id: [0x00048B57]
¡Muere! (Die!)

Id: [0x00048B5C]
Por favor. My legs. I am not able to stop the bleeding.

Id: [0x00048B5D]
I have done all I can, now you must trust in God.

Id: [0x00048B5E]
I'm afraid. Mis piernas. (My legs.) Mis piernas. (My legs.)

Id: [0x00048B5F]
Shhh. Think of all the coin you will be paid come the end of the battle.

Id: [0x00048B61]
Who is this Count of Lerin?

Id: [0x00048B62]
We are fighting for him are we not?

Id: [0x00048B63]
We are fighting for no one.

Id: [0x00048B65]
Keep moving, we must flank them.

Id: [0x00048B66]
De acuerdo. (Fine.)

Id: [0x00048B68]
I have heard Cesare Borgia commands the Navarrese.

Id: [0x00048B69]
¿Quién? (Who?)

Id: [0x00048B6A]
He once ruled all of Roma.

Id: [0x00048B6B]
What happened?

Id: [0x00048B6C]
I heard an assassin killed his supporters. Great rulers rise and fall like leaves in the wind.

Id: [0x00048B6D]
I will give you wind!

Id: [0x00048B70]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00048B72]
They must not see us.

Id: [0x00048B74]
When do we know if we have flanked them?

Id: [0x00048B75]
You will hear the gunfire.

Id: [0x00048B77]
Use the trees for cover.

Id: [0x00048B8B]
¡Déjame en paz! (Leave me alone!)

Id: [0x00048B8C]
I will not hurt you.

Id: [0x00048B8F]
That is my house. Por favor! (Please!)

Id: [0x00048B90]
No!

Id: [0x00048B95]
Run! Run! [Laughs]

Id: [0x00048B99]
You brought this upon yourselves through sin. This is how the Lord punishes you. Ours is a just God and this is justice. Praise the Lord! Thank you God for teaching us to be humble. To see our punishment for what it is, a call to spirituality. The Lord he giveth and the Lord he taketh away. So the truth is written. Amen!

Id: [0x00048B9B]

Id: [0x00048BB9]
Your generation is finished. It is my turn. I will not wait any longer. Your antiquated systems, your rules and hierarchies, it all must go.

Id: [0x00048BBA]
You intend to establish new ones under different names.

Id: [0x00048BBB]
I know what is best for the people of Italia, not a group of old men who wasted their energy fighting to the top years ago.

Id: [0x00048BC2]
You have won.

Id: [0x00048BD3]
Join the papal army, she said. Easy work. Good pay. Now look at me ... Capitano di questa barca di merda! (Captain of the shit boat!)

Id: [0x00048BD5]
How will I ever get used to the smell?

Id: [0x00048BD6]
[Groans] Fantastic! A new stench! As if the old one was not foul enough.

Id: [0x00048BD8]
Oh puzza (stink), smell that? Eduardo has arrived. Open the gate!

Id: [0x00048BDC]
Let us see if you can bite your master's hand, shall we?

Id: [0x00048BE0]
Perdonatemi (Forgive me), Leonardo.

Id: [0x00048BE1]
Make sure you're back before dawn! There's an earpiece and a watch...

Id: [0x00048BE2]
You mean it needs a password?

Id: [0x00048BE8]
Move along!

Id: [0x00048BE9]
This way!

Id: [0x00048BEA]
Keep pace!

Id: [0x00048BEB]
You! Follow me. The rest of you stay with the caravan.

Id: [0x00048BED]
Now is my chance!

Id: [0x00048BEE]
Perfect.

Id: [0x00048BF0]
It's caught fire! Run!

Id: [0x00048BF1]
No!

Id: [0x00048BF3]
He's stolen the machine!

Id: [0x00048BF4]
Bring it down!

Id: [0x00048BF9]
Più veloce! (Faster!)

Id: [0x00048BFA]
Va' all'inferno (Go to hell!)

Id: [0x00048BFB]
Stay away from me!

Id: [0x00048BFD]
Leonardo, you will help me stop them.

Id: [0x00048BFF]
Addio, amico mio! (Goodbye, my friend!)

Id: [0x00048C02]
Follow us! They have hidden the path, but we discovered the entrance.

Id: [0x00048C04]
Keep him back! I will warn the commander!

Id: [0x00048C06]
We will stop him!

Id: [0x00048C08]
There you are, finally.

Id: [0x00048C0A]
Leonardo expects me to maneuver this?

Id: [0x00048C0C]
No instructions. Of course.

Id: [0x00048C0E]
Merda! (Shit!) [Laughs]

Id: [0x00048C10]
Do not fall apart on me.

Id: [0x00048C12]
Watch out!

Id: [0x00048C16]
I wish I could keep you.

Id: [0x00048C18]
Do not test me.

A VIP is about to be assassinated.

Id: [0x00048C8D]
Simply follow the blue compass to find your target.

Id: [0x00048C8E]
Since you're engaged in open conflict, most bonuses will not be active.

Id: [0x00048C8F]
To escape, you'll need to keep out of sight.

Id: [0x00048C90]
Let's not underestimate the value of psychology. I want you to try to humiliate your pursuer now.

Id: [0x00048C91]
Don't forget to hide.

Id: [0x00048C92]
Remember to be discreet when you are within sight of your target.

Id: [0x00048C93]
Always keep in mind that other Templars will be targeting you. Tunnel vision can get you killed.

Id: [0x00048C94]
You can change your ability set each time the system synchronizes. Make sure to take advantage of this perk.

Id: [0x00048C95]
To find your target, follow the blue indicators, such as compass direction.

Id: [0x00048C96]
The width of the direction indicator increases when you close the distance between you and your target.

Id: [0x00048C97]
The compass pulses when you are close to your target, so be sure to watch it.

Id: [0x00048C98]
If you are not discreet as you approach your target, you may be spotted and then chased.

Id: [0x00048C99]
While being chased, you can escape by remaining out of sight.

Id: [0x00048C9A]
When out of sight, you can hide to vanish faster. This increases the likelihood you will escape.

Id: [0x00048C9B]
To maximize your score, start by approaching your target stealthily. We will reward you with Discreet or Silent bonuses.

Id: [0x00048C9C]
We may award you additional bonuses for performing acrobatic moves or making use of hiding places.

Id: [0x00048C9D]
Escaping your opponents will also grant you bonuses, especially if you can humiliate them. Remember, we will use bonuses to evaluate the full extent of your abilities.

Id: [0x00048C9E]
You can use two different abilities against both your target and your pursuers simultaneously.

Id: [0x00048C9F]
You'll find that each ability has a specific reloading time, in proportion to its power.

Id: [0x00048CA0]
Explore different abilities by experimenting with different sets each time you synchronize.

Id: [0x00048CA1]
Well done, Subject.

Id: [0x00048CA2]
Congratulations, Subject.

Id: [0x00048CA3]
You have completed your first challenge! Not everyone can claim that.

Id: [0x00048CA4]
You have made your first kill...but don't let it go to your head.

Id: [0x00048CA5]
You escaped assassination...not an easy task!

Id: [0x00048CA6]
I see you've made your first kill with the hidden gun!

Id: [0x00048CA7]
You are leading the session!

Id: [0x00048CA8]
You finished 1st!

Id: [0x00048CA9]
You finished 2nd!

Id: [0x00048CAA]
You finished 3rd!

Id: [0x00048CAB]
You won your first bet!

Id: [0x00048CAC]
You are now a level 5 Templar!

Id: [0x00048CAD]
You are now a level 10 Templar!

Id: [0x00048CAE]
I believe you've learned everything I can teach you. Your future with Abstergo depends on how well you utilize that knowledge.

Id: [0x00048CAF]
You can use Precise Aiming to lock on to your target.

Id: [0x00048CB0]
Follow the compass direction to stalk your target.

Id: [0x00048CB1]
Your target is close. Use your Observation skill.

Id: [0x00048CB2]
Remain inconspicuous while you are in sight of your target.

Id: [0x00048CB3]
A count of your pursuers is displayed near your rank.

Id: [0x00048CB4]
If you kill an innocent, you will lose your contract. That's a rule we've added to the simulation to keep things focused.

Id: [0x00048CB5]
Study your abilities. They will help you kill your target as well as escape any Templars targeting you.

Id: [0x00048CB6]
When chased, use the Chase Breaker to put distance between you and your pursuer.

Id: [0x00048CB7]
Try sitting on benches to hide from pursuers. Simple, but effective.

Id: [0x00048CB8]
Static groups within the crowd are perfect for hiding from other subjects.

Id: [0x00048CB9]
You can hide inside hay bales or bushes.

Id: [0x00048CBA]
The red arrow indicates the direction and distance of your pursuer. Neglecting this information can be fatal.

Id: [0x00048CBB]
You can surprise and humiliate your pursuer.

Id: [0x00048CBD]
You can run faster by sprinting.

Id: [0x00048CBE]
You are leading the match!

Id: [0x00048CBF]
Go!

Id: [0x00048CC0]

Id: [0x00048CC1]
Where is Da Vinci's machine?

Id: [0x00048CC3]
Fire!

Id: [0x00048CC4]
Go forward!

Id: [0x00048CC5]
Good shot!

Id: [0x00048CC6]
We missed!

Id: [0x00048CC7]
That was close!

Id: [0x00048CC8]
We must go, Ezio. Now!

Id: [0x00048CC9]
Amazing!

Id: [0x00048DEB]
What?

Id: [0x00048DED]
My sister knows how to wield a knife.

Id: [0x00048DEE]
And I am ready to do it again.

Id: [0x00048DEF]
Spoken like a true Auditore.

Id: [0x00048DF2]
It's about time.

Id: [0x00048DF5]
As if I have a choice.

Id: [0x00048DF9]
Ezio. News has spread that all my inventions have been destroyed. The disarray allowed me to work on something just for you.

Id: [0x00048DFB]
What is this?

Id: [0x00048DFC]
A new device to drift slowly from any height. It is not as cumbersome as my flying machine, you can take it everywhere.

Id: [0x00048DFD]
Grazie (Thank you), Leonardo.

Id: [0x00048E00]
Ezio, the Borgia were holding my flying machine, thanks to you I managed to liberate it! I trust you to keep it for me. Feel free to use it as you so desire.

Id: [0x00048E01]
I look forward to it.

Id: [0x00048E02]
Forget the past, it is time for a new future to rise.

Id: [0x00048E03]
You make the same mistake they did.

Id: [0x00048E04]
I do not make mistakes. I am enlightened.

Id: [0x00048E05]
Enlightenment comes through years of thought, not through conviction.

Id: [0x00048E06]
Ezio, your time is up.

Id: [0x00048E07]
Are you absolutely sure about this?

Id: [0x00048E08]
That's kind of why I'm saying it out loud Rebecca, yeah. But, I haven't got to the kicker yet. Construction on the Colosseum began in the year 72.

Id: [0x00048E09]
Something's bothering me. Today's date is October 10th.

Id: [0x00048E0A]
Why is today so important? We're just picking up the Apple and leaving.

Id: [0x00048E0B]
It's the door code. Someone wants to make sure we get it right.

Id: [0x00048E0C]
Yeah. I guess.

Id: [0x00048E0D]
What's happening? I can't move.

Id: [0x00048E0F]
Your DNA communes with the Apple. You have activated it.

Id: [0x00048E10]
Let me go!

Id: [0x00048E11]
On the 72nd day before the moment of awakening. You, birthed from our loins and the loins of our enemies. The end and the beginning, who we abhor and honor. The final journey commences.

Id: [0x00048E12]
There is one who would accompany you through the gate. She lies not within our sight. The cross darkens the horizon.

Id: [0x00048E14]
What are you doing?!

Id: [0x00048E15]
The Path must be opened.

Id: [0x00048E1C]
It is done. The way lies all before you. Only she remains to be found. Awaken the sixth. Go. ALONE!

Id: [0x00048E23]
You know very little. We must guide you.

Id: [0x00048E25]
Cease your struggle.

Id: [0x00048E28]
You cannot escape your part in this. The scales shall be balanced.

Id: [0x00048E37]
No.

Id: [0x00048E38]
Eden. She...in Eden. Find Eve. The key. Her DNA...

Id: [0x00048E39]
Tell me!

Id: [0x00048E3B]
Bene (Good). Go change into costume. Dawn approaches.

Id: [0x00048E3C]
I cannot imagine such wonders!

Id: [0x00048E3D]
We don't have time for chit-chat.

Id: [0x00048E3F]
Anyone up for reconciliatory yoga? Anyone?

Id: [0x00048E48]
We better get started.

Id: [0x00048E4A]
Come on, Desmond.

Id: [0x00048E4C]
Try using that special sight you learned from Altaïr.

Id: [0x00048E4F]
There's something here...

Id: [0x00048E50]
Can you open the damn bookcase, Desmond?

Id: [0x00048E52]
I am fine.

Id: [0x00048E53]
I will wait at the Campidoglio (Capitoline Hill), I am meeting a contact there.

Id: [0x00048EAB]
No!

Id: [0x00048EAD]
Merda! (Shit!)

Id: [0x00048EAE]
Now!

Id: [0x00048EAF]
Move!

Id: [0x00048EB0]
Forward!

Id: [0x00048EB1]
A hit!

Id: [0x00048EB2]
Cazzo! (Fuck!)

Id: [0x00048EB3]
Good!

Id: [0x00048EB4]
A miss!

Id: [0x00048EB5]
Where is he?

Id: [0x00048EB6]
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. Wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God, the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.

Perhaps another opportunity will arise.

Id: [0x00048EE6]
Next time, I am sure we will do business.

Id: [0x00048EFF]
Grazie, please do come again.

Id: [0x00048F00]
Pleasure was all mine, messere!

Maybe later eh? A presto.

Id: [0x00048F04]
Ah, later then.

Id: [0x00048F05]
I’ll be around should you need me.

Id: [0x00048F06]
Well, come back later then.

Id: [0x00048F07]
Alright, I should be here for a while.

Id: [0x00048F0E]
Guaranteed for life, haha!

Id: [0x00048F0F]
Grazie! Come again, please!

Id: [0x00048F10]
That will do quite well, yes? Addio!

Id: [0x00048F17]
Well, addio then.

Oh really, well later then.

May all your business fare well friend.

Id: [0x00048F21]
Transaction concluded!

Id: [0x00048F22]
Thank you for employing my services.

Id: [0x00048F26]
Not for now then? Alright.

Id: [0x00048F27]
So be it, come back if you need me.

Id: [0x00048F28]
Later then, I will surely be here.

Id: [0x00048F3B]
Oh, perhaps più tardi.

Id: [0x00048F3C]
Not a problem, I’ll be here if you need me.

Id: [0x00048F3D]
Do not worry, I am here most days, sicuro.

Id: [0x00048F3E]
Grazie for your business!

Id: [0x00048F3F]
Addio, e grazie!

Id: [0x00048F40]
Always a pleasure to serve Signore.

Id: [0x00048F41]
Dio vi benedica, amico!

Id: [0x00048F42]
Grazie, a presto!

Id: [0x00048F43]
May fortuna smile upon our continued business together.

Id: [0x00048F73]
I really can't talk now!

Id: [0x00048F74]
I can beat any man in these parts when it comes to speed. They say you might be a real test for me.

Id: [0x00048F75]
One, two, three, go!

Id: [0x00048FA2]
To secure his reign, Cesare needs to control the populace. Fear keeps them quiet.

Id: [0x00048FA3]
I can hardly look at you.

Id: [0x00048FA4]
Please, Valencia. Soon all this will be behind us.

Id: [0x00048FA5]
Are you afraid of him?

Id: [0x00048FA6]
Who? I am afraid of no one.

Id: [0x00048FA7]
Did he do that to your hand?

Id: [0x00048FA9]
My apologies. That was out of line.

Id: [0x00048FAA]
Please go.

Id: [0x00048FAB]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x00048FAD]
I will have her killed. No, I will kill her myself. The puttana (whore)!

Id: [0x00048FAE]
How dare she speak of my hand? Ignorant fool, she has never served a higher cause.

Id: [0x00048FAF]
I am better on my own.

Id: [0x00048FB1]
But children, Silvestro.

Id: [0x00048FB9]
Bambino (Little man), why do you cry?

Id: [0x00048FBA]
They're going to take my mamma on a boat ride. They say I will go on the next one.

Id: [0x00048FBB]
Who?

Id: [0x00048FBC]
A man from the castle came with guards and arrested us. He scared me.

Id: [0x00048FBD]
They ARE scary. But you look very brave.

Id: [0x00048FC0]
Will you bring my mamma back?

Id: [0x00048FC5]
Where did they take your mother?

Id: [0x00048FC6]
Down that street.

Id: [0x00048FC7]
Good. Do you have some place to go for now?

Id: [0x00048FC8]
My uncle's.

Id: [0x00048FC9]
Go there. Do not stop to talk to anyone!

Id: [0x00048FD6]
What happened?

Id: [0x00048FD8]
What is this?

Id: [0x00048FDB]
Careful!

Id: [0x00048FDD]
We're hit!

Id: [0x00048FDE]
Rallenta! (Slow down!) Rallenta, perdio, (damn,) rallenta!

Id: [0x00048FDF]
What are the other teams doing?

Id: [0x00048FE0]
Combating Abstergo's search for Pieces of Eden. As far as I know, Abstergo has no clue about the temples and Ezio's Apple. We might actually be ahead for once.

Id: [0x00048FE5]
Very funny guys.

Id: [0x00048FE6]
So, Shaun, any lions outside the pride?

Id: [0x00048FE7]
Who was that girl you were dating? Kate?

Id: [0x00048FE8]
Ahh, yeah. Kate. Katie, Katie, Katie, kitty-cat-Kate. Charmed the pants right off her I did.

Id: [0x00048FE9]
Yeah right. I know for a fact you didn't even get to second base.

Id: [0x00048FEC]
Oh, d-did you...wh-wh-what?

Id: [0x00048FF1]
We had lunch.

Id: [0x00048FF2]
You had...lunch...with Kate...

Id: [0x00048FF3]
Whatever. I got work to do.

Id: [0x00048FF9]
I'm kidding! You knew I was kidding, right?

Id: [0x00048FFA]
Riiight. Smile and nod.

Id: [0x00048FFB]
Someone just volunteered to get the food.

Id: [0x00048FFC]
It was worth it.

Id: [0x00049001]
Carnivore!

Id: [0x00049002]
Hypocrite! Did you know plants give off chemicals which attract predatory insects when they're attacked? Sounds pretty animal-like to me.

Id: [0x00049003]
You know too much for your own good.

Id: [0x00049004]
That's what my priest used to say.

Id: [0x00049006]
Any theories about that cipher Machiavelli handed me...Ezio, I mean.

Id: [0x00049007]
I can't decode it without the key. It's a one-time pad.

Id: [0x00049008]
What's that?

Id: [0x00049009]
It's a cipher with a unique, disposable key. Imagine someone used the first letter of each word in the Declaration of Independence to encipher something. Well without the Declaration itself, you couldn't decrypt it.

Id: [0x0004900A]
I could run it through the computer.

Id: [0x0004900B]
There are some things even a computer can't do...like love, Rebecca...like love.

Id: [0x00049012]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x00049014]
I will kill her if you come near me!

Id: [0x00049015]
Stay back!

Id: [0x00049016]
Hey Desmond. To achieve better synchronization with Ezio’s life, you should find that code sheet. I’ve marked the Lairs on your map.

Id: [0x00049018]
To synchronize with Ezio you will have to destroy Leo's machines. I've marked the whereabouts of the Templars overseeing their construction. I'll update the map when the machines' locations are found.

Id: [0x0004901D]
So where are the temples?

Id: [0x0004901E]
Wow.

Id: [0x0004901F]
The Apple seems to be in the center.

Id: [0x00049020]
Time to find out where those temples are.

Id: [0x0004902E]
As long as you remain discreet, your target will not become aware of your presence.

Id: [0x0004902F]
While in this state, you must avoid using high profile actions or you will be spotted.

Id: [0x00049030]
Your target has spotted you. You must exterminate him before the timer expires!

Id: [0x00049031]
If you manage to spot your pursuer, a chase will be triggered. That's your cue to escape!

Id: [0x00049032]
When you are being chased, escape by remaining out of sight.

Id: [0x00049033]
While out of sight, you can hide yourself to vanish faster. Doing so will increase your chances of escape.

Id: [0x00049034]
If you are not discreet as you near your target, you may be spotted and trigger a chase.

Id: [0x00049035]
The target you are chasing will try to break your line of sight to escape, but you're not going to let that happen, are you?

Id: [0x00049036]
If your target manages to evade you and is out of sight, try to find him using the compass. Examine every hiding place.

Id: [0x0004903F]
Your coin seems genuine.

Id: [0x00049040]
Hmpf. Ciao then.

Id: [0x00049041]
I’ll just count it again...

Id: [0x00049042]
Yes, I only serve the elite.

Id: [0x00049043]
You must lack the coin to shop here.

Id: [0x00049044]
Yes, you seem rather rustic for my high quality goods.

Id: [0x0004904D]
A pleasure Signore, return anytime!

Id: [0x0004904E]
That should do I hope… and please come back often!

Id: [0x0004904F]
There you go, sir. Mention me to your amici!

Id: [0x00049050]
I was sure I had what it was you needed… what was it again? Oh later then...

Id: [0x00049051]
Later then, yes? I’ll find something by then I’m sure…

Id: [0x00049052]
Well yes, not here is it? I think… Oh, goodbye for now!

Id: [0x00049057]
This may sting a little.

Id: [0x00049058]
You'll feel a pinch.

Id: [0x00049059]
This won't hurt a bit!

Id: [0x0004905D]
That should heal quickly now.

Id: [0x0004905E]
Trust me, you’ll soon feel much better, friend.

Id: [0x0004905F]
That’s it, come back if you need me.

Id: [0x00049060]
Perhaps another time then.

Id: [0x00049061]
I’ll be here should you change your mind.

Id: [0x00049062]
Addio for now then, return should you have need of me.

Id: [0x00049064]
Finally, you two came to your senses.

Id: [0x00049066]
The Followers of Romulus.

Id: [0x0004906C]
What happened to Caterina Sforza?

Id: [0x0004906E]
She went back to Florence and petitioned unsuccessfully for the return of her lands. Then, she died of pneumonia.

Id: [0x00049070]
That’s sad.

Id: [0x00049072]
That’s life. Well that's death technically, but you take my point.

Id: [0x00049074]
We ever going to visit the head Assassins? I heard about this meeting place when I was younger.

Id: [0x00049075]
Apparently, it exists. Though I’m not sure because I’ve never been.

Id: [0x00049076]
You'll get to see it once we have the Apple.

Id: [0x00049077]
What a waste of money.

Id: [0x0004907B]
How’s the power situation?

Id: [0x0004907C]
It’s okay for now, but the power lines are from the stone age.

Id: [0x0004907D]
Bloody third world country.

Id: [0x0004907E]
You’re talking about Italy?

Id: [0x0004907F]
No, Europe in general.

Id: [0x00049080]
I didn’t know England was a third world country.

Id: [0x00049081]
England is not in Europe actually, Rebecca. We tolerate Europe...you know, like a person tolerates herpes.

Id: [0x00049083]
How did you manage to create a copy of the Animus?

Id: [0x00049084]
Oh, you know. Lucy sent me schematics.

Id: [0x00049085]
I thought she couldn’t get anything out of Abstergo?

Id: [0x00049086]
She had her ways. I improvised on the rest.

Id: [0x0004908C]
Any news from the outside?

Id: [0x0004908D]
Rebecca’s patched in a phone line. The Templars are still guarding the border and Vidic seems to be busy too.

Id: [0x0004908E]
Doing what?

Id: [0x0004908F]
From the looks of things, he’s using Animus data to train Abstergo operatives.

Id: [0x00049090]
Meaning?

Id: [0x00049091]
Abstergo’s preparing for a full-on assault.

Id: [0x00049093]
Weren’t you the only Assassin at Abstergo's animus facility? How are you getting data from them?

Id: [0x00049094]
Some old passwords work, but I can’t dig very far into the network.

Id: [0x00049097]
Well, I expect amazing things. A private espresso bar for example.

Id: [0x00049098]
You obviously aren't an espresso drinker.

Id: [0x000490A0]
Huh.

Id: [0x000490A5]
Uncle...be careful.

Id: [0x000490A6]
I will.

Id: [0x000490A9]
It would be nice to have some help from above.

Id: [0x000490AA]
Our top Assassins are busy gathering info about the Templar satellite launch. We've pinpointed several possible facilities in the U.S., China and Russia, but there are no clear leads yet.

Id: [0x000490B2]
So Cesare was pretty secretive.

Id: [0x000490B3]
Yeah, he was yeah. Except weirdly when it came to sex. After his wedding, he sent a letter to the Pope explicitly describing the intercourse on his wedding night. According to the letter, Cesare and his French bride did the deed eight times.

Id: [0x000490B4]
Isn't that a Catholic thing?

Id: [0x000490B5]
What?

Id: [0x000490B6]
You're supposed to send the Pope a letter about your wedding night. It lets the old guy live a little, you know?

Id: [0x000490B7]
You know...that sounds quite plausible actually.

Id: [0x000490BB]
You ever killed anyone?

Id: [0x000490BC]
Hello to you too. [beat] I dated a guy who was an electronics expert around the time the Assassins first contacted me.

Id: [0x000490BE]
And?

Id: [0x000490BF]
And now I'm single.

Id: [0x000490C0]
Everything all right?

Id: [0x000490C1]
I don't like being stuck underground with them out there looking for us.

Id: [0x000490C2]
You're doing a great job. We're safe here.

Id: [0x000490C3]
But for how long? Vidic won't give up. I know it.

Id: [0x000490C4]
Neither will we.

Id: [0x000490C8]
Sometimes I feel so disconnected from everything out there. Nearly a decade of my life, gone, searching for those Pieces of Eden.

Id: [0x000490C9]
Think how great you'll feel when we finally stop the Templars.

Id: [0x000490CA]
I'm not sure it will ever end, Desmond. I can't do this forever.

Id: [0x000490CB]
I don't buy it. The Lucy I know brought me here and taught me how to see. She would never give up.

Id: [0x000490CD]
I guess I trained you pretty well, huh?

Id: [0x000490CE]
You did all right.

Id: [0x000490D1]
Why do we have to stay down here all day?

Id: [0x000490D2]
Abstergo's still looking for us. It would be better if we never went out at all, but then we'd run out of supplies.

Id: [0x000490D3]
It's like being in a cave during a rainstorm.

Id: [0x000490D4]
Yeah well, knowing the Templars, monsoon season's about to arrive.

Id: [0x000490D7]
Still managing the teams out in the field?

Id: [0x000490D8]
No phone line. Rebecca's working on patching us into the network.

Id: [0x000490D9]
So how's it feel letting the lady do all the work?

Id: [0x000490DA]
She's no lady.

Id: [0x000490DB]
Hey!

Id: [0x000490DE]
You think we're safe here?

Id: [0x000490DF]
I'm more concerned with the other Assassins out there. If Abstergo stumbles onto information about the temples, we could have a disaster on our hands.

Id: [0x000490E0]
The only people alive who've heard of the temples are here in this room.

Id: [0x000490E1]
For now. And, who knows, maybe they're listening to this conversation and you just gave everything away.

Id: [0x000490E2]
You brought them up first.

Id: [0x000490E3]
You are paranoid Desmond.

Id: [0x000490E4]
Ah...well played.

Id: [0x000490E5]
Are you kidding?

Id: [0x000490E6]
Of course I'm kidding. You think I would joke about someone I actually killed? Death is only funny when it isn't happening in front of you. I should know...and that's all I'm gonna say about that.

Id: [0x000490E9]
We're getting closer to the Apple. I can feel it.

Id: [0x000490EB]
If it were up to me, you'd take more breaks.

Id: [0x000490EC]
Good thing the fate of the world doesn't rest on your shoulders.

Id: [0x000490ED]
Hey. Joke all you want but your mental health is a serious concern. It only takes a couple of months for most Animus users to exhibit extreme side effects and you've been in for prolonged stretches of time.

Id: [0x000490EE]
I'll rest once we have the Apple.

Id: [0x000490EF]
I was afraid you'd say that.

Id: [0x000490F1]
It's amazing. The sequence is repairing itself, as if we're helping you work through psychological trauma.

Id: [0x000490F2]
So I'm going to be a more balanced person by the end of this?

Id: [0x000490F3]
Oh, I have no clue. But the idea's cool.

Id: [0x000490F4]
Are you saying that because you feel guilty about frying his brain?

Id: [0x000490F5]
Shaun's on latrine duty.

Id: [0x000490F6]
Deal.

Id: [0x000490F7]
Ah, of course yeah, you side with her. Communists.

Id: [0x000490FA]
Get ready.

Id: [0x000490FB]
Let's do this.

Id: [0x000490FC]
Get in position.

Id: [0x000490FD]
Let's jump this.

Id: [0x000490FE]
Ready?

Id: [0x00049100]
[boosts Lucy]

Id: [0x00049102]
[Pulls herself up over the wall]

Id: [0x00049104]
Okay.

Id: [0x00049105]
Grab my hand.

Id: [0x00049106]
Come on.

Id: [0x00049107]
I'm waiting.

Id: [0x00049108]
Reach for my hand.

Id: [0x0004910A]
[Pulls Desmond up]

Id: [0x0004910C]
Thanks.

Id: [0x0004910D]
Nice.

Id: [0x0004910E]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0004910F]
Good job.

Id: [0x00049110]
I made it.

Id: [0x00049111]
[Jump exertion]

Id: [0x00049113]
I noticed you didn't patch the translation software.

Id: [0x00049114]
Nah. It's still buggy. There's only the occasional glitch in the Italian, but if you hit any German or French, watch out!

Id: [0x00049118]
I will take his place.

Id: [0x0004911B]
Fire!

Id: [0x0004911C]
Hit the siege towers!

Id: [0x0004911D]
The mercenaries! Fire!

Id: [0x0004911E]
We need more ammunition!

Id: [0x0004911F]
They're storming the gate!

Id: [0x00049120]
Reload!

Id: [0x00049484]
Defend the ramparts!

Id: [0x00049485]
Kill them!

Id: [0x00049486]
We need more men!

Id: [0x00049487]
Fire now!

Id: [0x00049488]
Hold them back!

Id: [0x00049489]
He's injured!

Id: [0x0004948A]
Help me!

Id: [0x0004948C]
We have injured soldiers here!

Id: [0x0004948D]
These men are dying!

Id: [0x0004948E]
Attaccate! (Attack!)

Id: [0x0004948F]
Tirate! (Fire!)

Id: [0x00049490]
Colpiteli! (Fire!)

Id: [0x00049492]
Hold them back!

Id: [0x00049493]
We can only contain them a little longer!

Id: [0x00049494]
The villagers must escape!

Id: [0x00049496]
Aim for the siege towers, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x00049497]
Stop the siege towers, Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x00049498]
Hit the siege towers!

Id: [0x0004949A]
Signore (Sir), the towers!

Id: [0x0004949B]
Reload!

Id: [0x0004949D]
These?

Id: [0x0004949E]
Yes. Take them with you.

Id: [0x000494A1]
Fire at their battering rams!

Id: [0x000494A2]
You are crippling Cesare's army!

Id: [0x000494A3]
Just a few more shots!

Id: [0x000494A4]
Could Cesare find a worse task for me?

Id: [0x000494A6]
Cesare arms his ships to crush any opposition from Venezia (Venice).

Id: [0x000494AA]
They intend to craft more weapons.

Id: [0x000494AD]
We will stop the attack.

Id: [0x000494AE]
I have received several dozen work orders for carpenters and blacksmiths. What is all this about?

Id: [0x000494B3]
I have to get that gun away from the guards.

Id: [0x000494B9]
We do not know Ser [Sir].

Id: [0x000494BA]
I want him dead.

Id: [0x000494C8]
No one keeps ME waiting!

Id: [0x000494C9]
You're dead, Rocco, you hear me!

Id: [0x000494E0]
No one shall be spared!

Id: [0x000494E2]
Take this town for the Borgia!

Id: [0x000494E3]
Kill them all!

Id: [0x000494E4]
Show no mercy!

Id: [0x000494E5]
Attack!

Id: [0x00049552]

Luigi! The Banker sent us to ensure the safety of his money.

Id: [0x0004956F]
Going to the Banker's party? I will join you.

Id: [0x00049570]
We will follow you to the party.

Id: [0x00049574]
Il Carnefice watches from his home on the hill above. He threatens to hang me if I take her body.

Id: [0x00049576]
I will deal with Il Carnefice.

Id: [0x00049578]
A delivery for the Banker?

Id: [0x00049579]
Yes.

Id: [0x0004957A]
I will join you.

Id: [0x0004957C]
Luigi, where have you been? The Banker waits for his money.

Id: [0x0004957E]
Heading for the party? I shall follow.

Id: [0x00049585]
Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x00049586]
All set.

Id: [0x00049587]
Come on Desmond.

Id: [0x00049588]
Alright.

Id: [0x00049589]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x0004958A]
Ready Desmond.

Id: [0x0004958B]
Reach for my hand.

Id: [0x00049591]
OK.

Id: [0x000495F2]
Grab my hand.

Id: [0x000495F3]
I'm waiting.

Ready?

You ready Desmond?

Id: [0x00049618]
You just did not know it.

Id: [0x0004982A]
My thanks, that was too close. But I won’t survive the day out here… can you help me? I would gladly fight for you!

Id: [0x0004982B]
Grazie, mille grazie amico. You fight well, and for the right reasons it seems. Could you use another blade by your side?

Id: [0x0004982C]
You have saved this life. Please, take it and do with it as you will! I will repay your kindness with my sweat, blood and loyalty!

Id: [0x0004982D]
Welcome home.

Id: [0x0004982E]
Honor to serve the cause.

Id: [0x0004982F]
Ben trovato Maestro.

Id: [0x00049830]
I cannot… mi dispiace.

Id: [0x00049831]
That is beyond me brother.

Id: [0x00049832]
It is too complicated…

Id: [0x00049833]
Your presence honours me.

Id: [0x00049834]
Ben trovato Maestro.

Id: [0x00049835]
Peace favor you brother!

Id: [0x00049836]
Certo.

Id: [0x00049837]
Bene.

Id: [0x00049838]
Right.

Id: [0x00049839]
Stop your bleating Borgia sheep! I will only answer with my blade!

Id: [0x0004983A]
I would ask you to kiss my ass, but I cannot turn around thanks to your boyfriend here.

Id: [0x0004983B]
Are you done yet? I told you amico, all you’ll get from me is dead.

Id: [0x0004983C]
That was bravely done signore, grazie! Please, show me how to beat these tyrants!

Id: [0x0004983D]
They have much to answer for… I owe you my life, and will gladly dedicate it to this cause.

Id: [0x0004983E]
Messere, you have saved me! Only allow me the honour, that I may serve you!

Id: [0x0004983F]
You have my thanks, and my respect. Allow me to serve you!

Id: [0x00049840]
You fight oppression. If you will have me, I will fight with you!

Id: [0x00049841]
You have saved me, my life is yours to command!

Id: [0x00049842]
I will be watching.

Id: [0x00049843]
Later then.

Id: [0x00049844]
Understood, a piu tardi.

Id: [0x00049845]
You’ll not hurt any more innocents.

Id: [0x00049846]
Your death was necessary.

Id: [0x00049847]
Rest in peace.

Id: [0x00049848]
Bene.

Id: [0x00049849]
Si.

Id: [0x0004984A]
Alright.

Id: [0x0004984B]
Greetings noble one.

Id: [0x0004984C]
My respect, signore.

Id: [0x0004984D]
Maestro.

Id: [0x0004984E]
State bene brother?

Id: [0x0004984F]
Insieme brother, insieme!

Id: [0x00049850]
I am honoured, always Maestro.

Id: [0x00049851]
Si.

Id: [0x00049852]
D’accordo.

Id: [0x00049853]
Certo.

Id: [0x00049854]
But… how?

Id: [0x00049855]
I cannot do that…

Id: [0x00049856]
Impossible!

Id: [0x00049857]
I cannot get there…

Id: [0x00049858]
That is not possible…

Id: [0x00049859]
Beyond my ability…

Id: [0x0004985A]
How many guard-dogs does it take to hold down an entire city, cagna!

Id: [0x0004985B]
There is more honour in a thief, beggar or whore than in all you Borgia thugs! (spit)

Id: [0x0004985C]
Better not let go lackey, I’ll have your throat ripped out before you can cry Borgia!

Id: [0x0004985D]
I don’t see how that is possible.

Id: [0x0004985E]
I cannot signore.

Id: [0x0004985F]
I am sorry, I can’t.

Id: [0x00049860]
I will show you jackals what tyranny brings! Let me go!

Id: [0x00049861]
You talk big figlio d’un cane Borgia, try it with a foot of steel in your mouth!

Id: [0x00049862]
(spit) I will rip you all to bloody Borgia ribbons, just free my right arm!

Id: [0x00049863]
How? Non posso…

Id: [0x00049864]
I cannot do that…

Id: [0x00049865]
I do not see how I could…

Id: [0x00049866]
Had I known you would be here I’d have brought my axe, captain.

Id: [0x00049867]
Why don’t you boys let me go so I can say hello properly?

Id: [0x00049868]
What, you’re not scared of one piccolissima ragazza like me, are you?

Id: [0x00049869]
Rest in peace.

Id: [0x0004986A]
You did your duty.

Id: [0x0004986B]
There was honour in your death.

Id: [0x0004986C]
I know nothing about that good Captain, and I’d tell you anything if I did! Immediately! You know that, right?

Id: [0x0004986D]
Well, I did hear your wife was having orgies with your squad here, but I assumed you knew all about that.

Id: [0x0004986E]
The only segreto I have heard is that your mamma bred with goats, giving your face that indescribable charm…

Id: [0x0004986F]
Blessings upon you lord! You have saved this humble soul! Allow me to follow you!

Id: [0x00049870]
Grazie for my life! You have shown what these degenerates lack – the qualities of a true leader!  Please take me with you.

Id: [0x00049871]
Thank you signore! My life is worth nothing, but if it may serve you, I will consider it fulfilled!

Id: [0x00049872]
Call when you have need.

Id: [0x00049873]
Here when needed brother.

Id: [0x00049874]
Always ready to serve, a presto brother.

Id: [0x00049875]
Salve brother.

Id: [0x00049876]
Always ready, Signore.

Id: [0x00049877]
My respect, Elder Brother.

Id: [0x00049878]
Si.

Id: [0x00049879]
Right.

Id: [0x0004987A]
On it.

Id: [0x0004987B]
Peace be on you, maestro.

Id: [0x0004987C]
Always good to see you, signore.

Id: [0x0004987D]
Bentornato capo.

Id: [0x0004987E]
Salve then brother.

Id: [0x0004987F]
Until later, signore.

Id: [0x00049880]
Call when the need arises.

Id: [0x00049881]
Peace keep you now.

Id: [0x00049882]
Death bring you peace.

Id: [0x00049883]
You knew not what you did.

Id: [0x00049884]
Requiescat in pace.

Id: [0x00049885]
Sleep now.

Id: [0x00049886]
May you find peace.

Id: [0x00049887]
If my arms were as loose as your lips, you would be sprouting a foot of steel from your guts!

Id: [0x00049888]
Come on Borgia pig, you and me, da uomo a uomo! Surely a runty peasant like me is no threat?

Id: [0x00049889]
You talk of the glory of Borgia rule, but all we receive is the fist! Enough! Now your fist will meet our steel!

Id: [0x0004988A]
I will await your call.

Id: [0x0004988B]
Arrivederci then.

Id: [0x0004988C]
Si, back to the shadows.

Id: [0x0004988D]
The only fit end for you I’m afraid.

Id: [0x0004988E]
Peace guide your soul.

Id: [0x0004988F]
In death, my enemy no more.

Id: [0x00049890]
None here would suffer as they do if it was not for the Borgia!

Id: [0x00049891]
Let me go and I will give you a message for your masters!

Id: [0x00049892]
How many Borgia lackeys does it take to hold one lone woman?

Id: [0x00049893]
I thought I was dead there… thank you. But the Borgia will still be the death of me… unless you know how to fight back?

Id: [0x00049894]
Grazie! The Borgia bastardi… but you fight! And you are a remarkable warrior… could you teach me your art?

Id: [0x00049895]
Many thanks friend, I did not think I’d live that time. They grow more bold the dogs… may I fight with you? Together we are stronger, yes?

Id: [0x00049896]
Bene.

Id: [0x00049897]
Si signore.

Id: [0x00049898]
Alright.

Id: [0x00049899]
I am unable to do that…

Id: [0x0004989A]
I cannot brother…

Id: [0x0004989B]
Non posso… impossibile!

Id: [0x0004989C]
Rest in peace.

Id: [0x0004989D]
You have earned this by your acts.

Id: [0x0004989E]
Death is the fate of all men.

Id: [0x0004989F]
Later then.

Id: [0x000498A0]
Back to the shadows.

Id: [0x000498A1]
Call if you have need.

Id: [0x000498A2]
I will be ready.

Id: [0x000498A3]
Later then.

Id: [0x000498A4]
Understood.

Id: [0x000498A5]
Pfa! You would already be dead if your wife here had not got me from behind!

Id: [0x000498A6]
Cagna, go make puppies with Cesare! I hear he likes to take all kinds of bestia to his bed.

Id: [0x000498A7]
It will bring me great joy to take your head off cazzo. Just ask your pet donkey to let go for two seconds…

Id: [0x000498A8]
Your courage does you credit amico, though I fear it only delays my fate. Unless you have a good plan, they will find me again.

Id: [0x000498A9]
Grazie friend, they caught me unawares that time. I was a dead man for sure yet you handled them easily… ti prego, teach me!

Id: [0x000498AA]
My life, such as it is, is yours signore. Make me into a weapon that I may better strike their black Borgia heart.

Id: [0x000498AB]
Maestro.

Id: [0x000498AC]
Il miei omaggi, Signore.

Id: [0x000498AD]
Welcome back, capo.

Id: [0x000498AE]
I miei omaggi, Maestro!

Id: [0x000498AF]
Noble brother, it is good to see you!

Id: [0x000498B0]
Always an honour signore!

Id: [0x000498B1]
I could have taken them, but grazie. Say, which way are you going?

Id: [0x000498B2]
That was close, grazie. Would you teach me to fight these vermin as you do?

Id: [0x000498B3]
I still breathe thanks to you. What skill I have is yours, if you will have me.

Id: [0x000498B4]
I don’t see how I could…

Id: [0x000498B5]
Not possible…

Id: [0x000498B6]
I cannot do that.

Id: [0x000498B7]
Ah, welcome home signore.

Id: [0x000498B8]
Per la vittoria, siamo Assassini!

Id: [0x000498B9]
Insieme, honoured Brother!

Id: [0x000498BA]
Impossibile!

Id: [0x000498BB]
I cannot!

Id: [0x000498BC]
I do not think I can do that…

Id: [0x000498BD]
Grazie! My skills are limited, but if you will have me I’ll fight with you.

Id: [0x000498BE]
I thank you! It would be an honour to fight alongside you, signore!

Id: [0x000498BF]
Thank you! Your courageous example I would gladly follow.

Id: [0x000498C0]
Si.

Id: [0x000498C1]
Certo.

Id: [0x000498C2]
Bene.

Id: [0x000498C3]
Later then.

Id: [0x000498C4]
As you wish.

Id: [0x000498C5]
Always ready to strike.

Id: [0x000498C6]
Certo.

Id: [0x000498C7]
Right.

Id: [0x000498C8]
Si.

Id: [0x000498C9]
I cannot brother.

Id: [0x000498CA]
That is beyond me!

Id: [0x000498CB]
Impossibile fratello.

Id: [0x000498CC]
Bene, arrivaderci.

Id: [0x000498CD]
I will remain vigilant.

Id: [0x000498CE]
Awaiting your signal.

Id: [0x000498CF]
The just deserts of a tainted life.

Id: [0x000498D0]
Death knows no master, her word is final.

Id: [0x000498D1]
Rest in the peace you so richly deserve.

Id: [0x000498D2]
Rest in peace.

Id: [0x000498D3]
Your death was necessary.

Id: [0x000498D4]
Your end served a higher purpose.

Id: [0x000498D5]
Peace be on your soul.

Id: [0x000498D6]
Requiescat in pace.

Id: [0x000498D7]
La pace ultima della morte.

Id: [0x000498D8]
Good to see you capo.

Id: [0x000498D9]
Always an honour Maestro.

Id: [0x000498DA]
Thanks to you, we grow ever stronger.

Id: [0x000498DB]
You are such a grande coglione when you have me pinned by your friends. Let me go, you’ll be a dead coglione!

Id: [0x000498DC]
If you are going to kill me, shut that infernal reeking trap you call a mouth and get on with it!

Id: [0x000498DD]
I don’t know what you are talking about, I love the Borgia! I love them stabbed, hung, poisoned, beheaded, defenestrated…

Id: [0x000498DE]
To the shadows, to wait, and watch.

Id: [0x000498DF]
As you wish.

Id: [0x000498E0]
I will remain vigilant.

Id: [0x000498E1]
That was well done… please, teach me to fight them as you do!

Id: [0x000498E2]
Your actions are truly noble! Allow my fury to strike with yours!

Id: [0x000498E3]
Your cause is also mine, my life is at your service!

Id: [0x000498E4]
Bene signore, later then.

Id: [0x000498E5]
As you wish brother, addio.

Id: [0x000498E6]
Until later fratello.

Id: [0x000498E7]
Rest in peace.

Id: [0x000498E8]
Welcome death’s final embrace.

Id: [0x000498E9]
Suffer no more, enter the void.

Id: [0x000498EA]
Intesi.

Id: [0x000498EB]
Bene.

Id: [0x000498EC]
Got it.

Id: [0x000498ED]
Va bene.

Id: [0x000498EE]
Right.

Id: [0x000498EF]
Certo.

Id: [0x000498F0]
What is this about capo? I didn’t kill your brother, merely removed his coglioni!

Id: [0x000498F1]
Why don’t you have your ape release me and we’ll settle this properly!

Id: [0x000498F2]
Just give me half a chance porco, you’ll be choking on your own blood.

Id: [0x000498F3]
Certo.

Id: [0x000498F4]
Bene.

Id: [0x000498F5]
Daccordo.

Id: [0x000498F6]
I cannot…

Id: [0x000498F7]
How? I cannot get there…

Id: [0x000498F8]
That is beyond my abilities…

Id: [0x000498F9]
I owe you my life! I am a marked man now… but you… you fight them Signore! Allow me to hunt with you!

Id: [0x000498FA]
My thanks for you aid. But they will hunt me down… I cannot remain. Will you take me with you, signore?

Id: [0x000498FB]
I live today, and thanks to you may kill more of the Borgia’s truce scherani. Let me join my blade to yours brother!

Id: [0x0004A5B6]
You will pay for crossing the Borgia!

Id: [0x0004A5B7]
Ha! The Borgia will crush you!

Id: [0x0004A5B8]
No man lives long once he has angered the Borgia!

Id: [0x0004A5B9]
You won’t catch me!

Id: [0x0004A5BA]
I will not be caught by you!

Id: [0x0004A5BB]
I am too smart for you assassin!

Id: [0x0004A61C]
My children. Where are my children?!

Id: [0x0004A61D]
Get your things and go!

Id: [0x0004A61E]
My leg!

Id: [0x0004A61F]
Where are we going?!

Id: [0x0004A620]
My mother. I can't find my mother.

Id: [0x0004A621]
Aiuto! Aiuto! (Help me! Help me!)

Id: [0x0004A622]
Water. Water. Everything is burning!

Id: [0x0004A623]
[Scream]

Id: [0x0004A624]
[Scream]

Id: [0x0004A625]
[Screams and sobs]

Id: [0x0004A627]
Use the cannons above the ramparts. I intend to lead a frontal assault.

Id: [0x0004A628]
Fire!

Id: [0x0004A62A]
They're storming the gate!

Id: [0x0004A62B]
Hold them back!

Id: [0x0004A62D]
These men are dying!

Id: [0x0004A62E]
[Screams]

Id: [0x0004A62F]
We could not leave without you.

Id: [0x0004A630]
Go! Go now!

Id: [0x0004A631]
They're breaching the gate!

Id: [0x0004A634]
Go my son, destroy them...but remember for whom we Assassins fight.

Id: [0x0004A636]
Watch the weapon carefully. We must be ready to take it to safety should anything happen.

Id: [0x0004A638]
Tell your comrades that only Eduardo may examine the invention up close to make the final adjustments.

Id: [0x0004A639]
Yes, Capitano (Captain).

Id: [0x0004A63A]
He travels by boat to see the mechanism now.

Id: [0x0004A64D]
Cesare must know of this!

Id: [0x0004A650]
The invention is under guard and I caged the spies.

Id: [0x0004A651]
Those who attempted to steal from Cesare must be punished.

Id: [0x0004A654]
Cesare intends it as the centerpiece of his forces. His army prepares for a surprise assault on Sicilia (Sicily).

Id: [0x0004A657]
These are them?

Id: [0x0004A658]
Yes.

Id: [0x0004A659]
Leave them to starve.

Id: [0x0004A6D8]
We have light!

Id: [0x0004A6DA]
Here.

Id: [0x0004A71C]
Damn. I needed that light.

Id: [0x0004A84B]
Move!

Id: [0x0004A84D]

I thank you on behalf of my brethren tailors of Roma messere.

Id: [0x0004A873]
A good turn deserves another! The tailors’ guild will find a way to repay you I am sure!

We are but a minor guild messere, yet you aid us as a true friend. We thank you most deeply!

Id: [0x0004A875]
Truly you are our champion messere! The thanks of our arte to you!

The tailors of Roma thank you sincerely for this good deed!

We all are humbled you have done this for us.

Id: [0x0004A87C]
The arte dei sarti is in you debt, messere!

Id: [0x0004A87D]
The guild will surely offer a year’s supply of leeches in thanks!

Id: [0x0004A87E]
You have all of our thanks friend, rest assured of that!

Id: [0x0004A87F]
The entire Arte surely joins me in offering you many thanks!

Id: [0x0004A880]
Messere, on behalf of all the medici of Roma, grazie!

Id: [0x0004A881]
I know I speak on behalf of my brothers when I say thank you, and well done friend.

Id: [0x0004A882]
The guild is in your debt messere, grazie.

Id: [0x0004A883]
Grazie messere, from all the city’s medici.

Id: [0x0004A884]
Truly your presence here is a boon to the guild, messere.

Id: [0x0004A885]
You have our best interests at heart! Thank you on behalf of the whole guild.

Id: [0x0004A886]
As one of the Maestri in charge of the Arte dei Medici, I give you all our thanks, friend.

Id: [0x0004A887]
Such a noble act undertaken for the good of our Guild. A blessing of health upon you messere!

Id: [0x0004A888]
Thank you friend! We are all in your debt!

Id: [0x0004A889]
Many thanks amico, we were all hoping you would be successful.

Id: [0x0004A88A]
You have done a great thing for the Guild messere, molte grazie!

Id: [0x0004A88B]
All the medical fraternity of Roma joins me in thanking you most sincerely, messere.

Id: [0x0004A88C]
My fellow doctors and I thank you for your brave efforts, amico.

Id: [0x0004A88D]
The Arte dei Medici is very pleased with your success amico!

Id: [0x0004A88E]
You have done all Roma’s doctors a kind service messere!

Id: [0x0004A893]
He's stealing the weapon!

Id: [0x0004AAC3]
Ah well, next time.

Id: [0x0004AAC4]
Perhaps later then, addio.

Id: [0x0004AAC5]
Another day, perhaps.

Id: [0x0004AAC6]
I can’t, and my men grow restless.

Id: [0x0004AAC7]
I’m sorry, but it is their law.

Id: [0x0004AAC8]
No building can I do… scusatemi.

Id: [0x0004AACC]
It is a shame, but I can do nothing.

Id: [0x0004AACD]
I cannot apply my talents!

Id: [0x0004AACE]
They will not permit any new building.

Id: [0x0004AACF]
My hands are tied messere!

Id: [0x0004AAD0]
I cannot… my talents are being wasted!

Id: [0x0004AAD1]
Only projects approved by them, I’m afraid…

Id: [0x0004AAD2]
A pity, but I can do nothing,

Id: [0x0004AAD3]
I would love to… but cannot.

Id: [0x0004AAD4]
If only I were free to set my crew al lavoro!

Id: [0x0004AAD5]
A pleasure!

Id: [0x0004AAD6]
Grazie, addio!

Id: [0x0004AAD7]
Thank you, hope to see you again soon!

Id: [0x0004AAD8]
There is unfortunately nothing I can do.

Id: [0x0004AAD9]
The rione is locked down, I cannot work.

Id: [0x0004AADA]
Sadly my masons cannot work.

Id: [0x0004AAE4]
Most profitable I assure you.

Id: [0x0004AAE5]
Salute! To business well concluded.

Id: [0x0004AAE6]
Grazie, addio messere.

Id: [0x0004AAE7]
Another time.

Id: [0x0004AAE8]
Oh, addio then.

Id: [0x0004AAE9]
Well, perhaps later.

Id: [0x0004AAF0]
Not to worry, I’ll be here.

Id: [0x0004AAF1]
Another time then.

Id: [0x0004AAF2]
Ah, well then a presto I suppose.

Id: [0x0004AAF6]
A profitable pleasure!

Id: [0x0004AAF7]
Always here for you messere.

Id: [0x0004AAF8]
Concluded to a mutual satisfaction, was it not?

Id: [0x0004AAFE]
Ezio.

Id: [0x0004AB06]
You have need of my assistance?

Id: [0x0004AB07]
The thieves in Roma are young. Skilled, but young. Prone to rivalries.

Id: [0x0004AB08]
Another gang?

Id: [0x0004AB09]
The Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes). Cesare Borgia's bootlickers. They cause us significant trouble.

Id: [0x0004AB0A]
Where can I find them?

Id: [0x0004AB0B]
My thieves will show you.

Id: [0x0004AB33]
The Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) are angry.

Id: [0x0004AB35]
Bene. (Good.)

Id: [0x0004AB36]
I expect retaliation.

Id: [0x0004AB37]
They will have no opportunity. We take the fight to them. Seek out my spies, they plan as we speak.

Id: [0x0004AB58]
Ezio. Your help has been invaluable. Now we must finish the Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes). Only their leaders deal with the Borgia. Remove them and the gang disbands permanently.

Id: [0x0004AB5B]
I will consult with your spies.

Id: [0x0004AB5C]
Bene. (Good.)

Id: [0x0004AB6C]
Ezio! Here to fight?

Id: [0x0004AB6D]
Show my men what you can do!

Id: [0x0004AB6E]
Nothing like a fight to get the blood flowing!

Id: [0x0004AB6F]
Ezio! Get in there!

Id: [0x0004AB70]
Ready to lay down your arms and fight like a man?

Id: [0x0004AB77]
Madonna, (Madame) has Machiavelli sent word?

Id: [0x0004AB78]
Yes. The pigeons deliver the names of key papal agents. The Jubilee has brought pilgrims to Roma, their money taken by the Church in exchange for absolution. Threats of damnation terrorize those reluctant to pay. The agents' collections go directly to Cesare.

Id: [0x0004AB80]
Ezio, the Borgia grow uncertain as your attacks continue. The Pope's spies move throughout the city. Fortunately, Machiavelli has uncovered their names.

Id: [0x0004AB85]
Your success unnerves the Pope further. Rodrigo has added several new members to the curia, filling the Papal government with men willing to kneel before the Borgia. Machiavelli knows them well.

Id: [0x0004AB86]
And soon, so will I.

Id: [0x0004AE5B]
Buongiorno (hello), Mother.

Id: [0x0004AE5C]
Ezio. Thank you for coming to see me.

Id: [0x0004AE5D]
What troubles the courtesans?

Id: [0x0004AE5E]
The old proprietor of this brothel, Madonna (Madame) Solari was a cheat and liar. Her ties to the Church have been uncovered. Worse, several of those who work for us sleep with the enemy still.

Id: [0x0004AE5F]
I will find them.

Id: [0x0004AE60]
Visit the girls I trust, they will help you. Grazie (Thank you), Ezio.

Id: [0x0004AE64]
Well done, Ezio. The courtesans tell me only the loyal remain.

Id: [0x0004AE65]
They speak the truth.

Id: [0x0004AE66]
Then let us not delay. Ambassadors from the Spanish King and German Emperor have been discovered in Roma, seeking Cesare's support. Render them impotent, my son.

Id: [0x0004AEB3]
Ezio, this is Egidio Troche.

Id: [0x0004AEB4]
I have gone from the Banker's debt into yours and I'm very thankful for it. You know I have not seen the inside of a tavern for months? The opportunity to change things here trumps a drink any day!

Id: [0x0004AEB6]
We have met.

Id: [0x0004AEB7]
The Senator was just telling me of the inner workings of Cesare's court.

Id: [0x0004AEB8]
Maria informs me that you eliminated the foreign ambassadors, but you must stop any message of your act from reaching Cesare. The members of the court guilty of meeting with the ambassadors should also be...waylaid, if you know what I mean. Most importantly, the great agitator Prospero Colonna has been captured. If you free him, it will mean a great blow to the Borgia.

Id: [0x0004AEB9]
It shall be done, my friend.

Id: [0x0004AEBA]
Rest in peace my friend.

Id: [0x0004AEBB]
Your death was not in vain.

Id: [0x0004AEBC]
Your sacrifice will be remembered.

Id: [0x0004AEBD]
It was an honour to fight beside you, my friend.

Id: [0x0004AEBE]
I am sorry you had to pay so heavy a price.

Id: [0x0004AEBF]
Cazzo… that last one… went deep!

Id: [0x0004AEC0]
I am hurt… bad…

Id: [0x0004AEC1]
My blood flows… I grow weak…

Id: [0x0004AEC2]
I will not hold out much longer…

Id: [0x0004AEC3]
I am losing much blood…

Id: [0x0004AEC4]
Death comes for me…

Id: [0x0004AEC5]
I cannot hold on much longer…

Id: [0x0004AEC6]
I have been hit, badly…

Id: [0x0004AEC7]
I grow… weak…

Id: [0x0004AEC8]
That one… ah… may have ended me!

Id: [0x0004AEC9]
I fear I will not make it, brother…

Id: [0x0004AECA]
Dannazione… that cut was deep… I must fall back or die…

Id: [0x0004AECB]
I am near the end brother!

Id: [0x0004AECC]
They got one through… I bleed…

Id: [0x0004AECD]
Ah, the pain! I cannot go on much longer.

Id: [0x0004AECE]
Death reaches for me brother!

Id: [0x0004AECF]
I am too weak… I must soon fall!

Id: [0x0004AED0]
My breath runs out… I cannot last much longer!

Id: [0x0004AED1]
Dah! This is too much for me!

Id: [0x0004AED2]
I fear I must fall here brother!

Id: [0x0004AED3]
Death comes for me… so be it!

Id: [0x0004AED4]
Death comes for me!

Id: [0x0004AED5]
I fear I reach my end.

Id: [0x0004AED6]
At least I will not die alone!

Id: [0x0004AED7]
Nyuh… I grow weak…

Id: [0x0004AED8]
My strength deserts me…

Id: [0x0004AED9]
If I am finished… so be it!

Id: [0x0004AEDA]
The next blow may be my last!

Id: [0x0004AEDB]
I weaken brother!

Id: [0x0004AEDC]
Neearrg… I bleed…

Id: [0x0004AEDD]
Ezio.

Id: [0x0004AEDE]
Grazie (Thank you).

Id: [0x0004AEDF]
I will make money the least of their worries.

Id: [0x0004AEE1]
Ezio! The tower.

Id: [0x0004AEE2]
Wait, I don't get it.

Id: [0x0004AEE3]
Grazie.

Id: [0x0004AEE4]

You are now a level 30 Templar!

Id: [0x0004AEFC]
You are now a level 40 Templar!

Id: [0x0004AEFD]
You are now a level 50 Templar!

Id: [0x0004AEFE]
You are now a level 20 Templar!

Id: [0x0004AFCA]
They say you are the fastest in the entire città… come, let’s race to see if they have it right!

Id: [0x0004AFCB]
I’ve heard you are the best there is when it comes to racing. Allow me to see how I compare?

Id: [0x0004AFFA]
Ezio! Since Madonna Solari's death, her brother Santino claims ownership of us.

Id: [0x0004AFFB]
He struggles to gain Borgia favor and must prove himself leader of the courtesans. Humiliate him in public and he loses the support of the Borgia. We will not hear from him again.

Id: [0x0004AFFD]
Buongiorno (Hello), Ezio. We are taught to seduce Roma's most powerful men, but not all of us have been able to resist their charms.

Id: [0x0004B000]
Follow Giuletta. I suspect she will lead you to her benefactor.

Id: [0x0004B002]
I did not know the bastardo (bastard) was a traitor!

Id: [0x0004B003]
Ezio. I entertained Bavarese (Bavarian) ambassadors last night. They must have...poisoned me. How? We drank from the same cup! I don't remember what happened next.

Id: [0x0004B004]
Come. We must find them.

Id: [0x0004B006]
Him! He was there!

Id: [0x0004B007]
What are you pointing at, puttana (whore)?

Id: [0x0004B009]
Wait...was it him? He looks familiar...but...no matter. Come, I will find another.

Id: [0x0004B00B]
You! You poisoned me!

Id: [0x0004B00C]
What?

Id: [0x0004B00E]
I remember his name. Gisbert. Or is it Georg? Follow me.

Id: [0x0004B010]
Him! Get him!

Id: [0x0004B011]
What is this?

Id: [0x0004B013]
Grazie (Thank you), Ezio. I am sure at least two of them were there last night.

Id: [0x0004B014]
Buona fortuna (Good luck), and stay out of the wine, Madonna (Madame).

Id: [0x0004B016]
Ezio, you banished that spy Giuletta from the brothel but she continues to give information to our enemy! A Spanish ambassador this time, her lover. We know he sells secrets to the Church.

Id: [0x0004B018]
Giuletta fears you now. Use that. Send her right into the arms of her Spaniard and kill him.

Id: [0x0004B01A]
Please...I had no choice!

Id: [0x0004B01C]
No! Please!

Id: [0x0004B01D]
Ezio! I can explain!

Id: [0x0004B01E]
Help me!

Id: [0x0004B01F]
Somebody! Stop him!

Id: [0x0004B022]
Leave Roma. I do not want to see you here again.

Id: [0x0004B025]
Ezio, I will lead you to three ambassadors. They are here to meet with the pope, but will answer to God much sooner than they expect.

Id: [0x0004B026]
Allow me to lure them out before you strike.

Id: [0x0004B028]
Hans! You asked if I had any friends you could play with! I have invited one!

Id: [0x0004B02A]
Where? Where is she?

Id: [0x0004B02B]
Wait right there!

Id: [0x0004B02E]
Follow.

Id: [0x0004B030]
Salve, amore (Hello, lover)

Id: [0x0004B031]
This is inappropriate!

Id: [0x0004B032]
Not compared to what I plan to do to you. Follow me.

Id: [0x0004B034]
If he won't go, I will!

Id: [0x0004B036]
No, I will take care of this.

Id: [0x0004B037]
Oh, there you are! Follow me, I have something to show you.

Id: [0x0004B039]
Wait here. I have a surprise for you.

Id: [0x0004B03A]
Hah! Your last surprise nearly killed me!

Id: [0x0004B03C]
Addio (Goodbye), Ezio. Stay safe.

Id: [0x0004B04A]
Ezio, my sister has been poisoned! A larger dose of the same drug they used on me.

Id: [0x0004B04B]
We know who sells it. A street doctor named Tommaso. He has the antidote, but not for sale. You must find another way! Hurry, Flora's time grows short!

Id: [0x0004B052]
Do not kill Tommaso. We may need him to track down his clients.

Id: [0x0004B054]
Ezio! You have saved my sister's life. Grazie (Thank you).

Id: [0x0004B091]
Ezio, my loyalty to your family has left me in a precarious situation. Rodrigo is trading favors with his foreign ambassadors. He wishes to gain information that will lead him to you.

Id: [0x0004B092]
I go to meet with one of these ambassadors. He will demand my help and I will provide none. He may try to respond with violence, which is why you will be watching.

Id: [0x0004B094]
(Screams)

Id: [0x0004B095]
Ezio!

Id: [0x0004B096]
Aiutatemi! (Help me!)

Id: [0x0004B097]
Come any closer and I WILL bleed her!

Id: [0x0004B098]
You cannot protect them all!

Id: [0x0004B099]
Show yourself!

Id: [0x0004B09B]
Grazie (Thank you), Ezio. My faith in you is well placed.

Id: [0x0004B0E4]
Let me guess, you need more designs.

Id: [0x0004B0E6]
Back for more designs...again?

Id: [0x0004B0E8]
What can I get you this time?

Id: [0x0004B0EA]
Let me guess, you need something.

Id: [0x0004B0ED]
I can show you where, but I leave the rest to you. We must ride.

Id: [0x0004B0EE]
The Senator and I have uncovered the planned meeting place of the Borgia and the foreign ambassadors. You have killed the ambassadors, now those who plotted with them must be stopped.

Id: [0x0004B0F0]
All of them...dead!

Id: [0x0004B0F2]
Ezio!

Id: [0x0004B0F4]
Grazie (Thank you), Ezio! I will return to the Rosa in Fiore (The Blooming Rose). The others will know of your bravery.

Id: [0x0004B0F5]
The same fate greets all who fail the Borgia!

Id: [0x0004B0F6]
Ezio, Cesare has captured the great condottieri (mercenaries) Prospero and Fabrizio Colonna. He has brought them to Roma for torture.

Id: [0x0004B0F7]
Once freed, these men will cause significant trouble for the Borgia and their allies. They will be transferred soon, under guard, but I suspect that will not be a problem for you.

Id: [0x0004B0F9]
You have saved us, amico (friend).

Id: [0x0004B0FA]
You are not free yet. Prepare yourselves!

Id: [0x0004B0FC]
There must be a way we can repay your kindness.

Id: [0x0004B0FD]
Continue the fight against the Borgia.

Id: [0x0004B0FE]
Addio (Goodbye)!

Id: [0x0004B0FF]
That we will. Addio, amico mio (Goodbye, my friend)!

Id: [0x0004B128]
Ezio! News of our work has reached the pope. As we speak, he prepares a courier for Romagna. If Cesare suspects his allegiances are slipping, he will fill the city with troops.

Id: [0x0004B129]
Take the pope's letter from the courier without his knowledge. Bring it to me and I will prepare a forgery. We will make sure Cesare receives his report.

Id: [0x0004B190]
Here we are.

Id: [0x0004B191]
What are you planning, woman?

Id: [0x0004B192]
Patience. Wait here.

Id: [0x0004B195]
Bene (Good). I can work with this. Give me a moment.

Id: [0x0004B197]
Replace the letter before the courier realizes he has lost it. Cesare will be delighted to know all is well in Roma.

Id: [0x0004B1D7]
Ezio! You must help my brother, Aldo! Those banditi (bandits) took him! Please...he only picks pockets. He has never harmed anyone!

Id: [0x0004B1DA]
Kill him!

Id: [0x0004B1DB]
No! Please!

Id: [0x0004B1DD]
Grazie a Dio! Grazie a Dio! (Thank God! Thank God!)

Id: [0x0004B1DE]
Ezio! They said you were coming, but I did not believe it! The Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) have challenged us to a brawl! Little risk for them since they have greater numbers, but they will not be expecting you!

Id: [0x0004B1DF]
They will arrive soon. Ready yourself!

Id: [0x0004B1E0]
Ezio Auditore? Perdiana! (Wow!) [Laugh] I've heard stories about your speed! Let us see if you can match mine!

Id: [0x0004B1E1]
Their banditi (bandits) patrol Roma's rooftops today. If they were to...disappear, no one would miss them.

Id: [0x0004B1E2]
We have an unspoken agreement with the poor in Roma. We do not steal from them and in turn they do not see us. But the Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) prey upon these people.

Id: [0x0004B1E3]
We now have a chance to damage relations between our two enemies. Find Galvano, kill him, and take something personal from his body. Plant it on Vincenzo. My brothers and I will make sure the Borgia hear what we want them to hear.

Id: [0x0004B1E4]
The Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) employ a silver-tongued scribe, Vincenzo. Despite his eloquence, he often fights with a Borgia guard named Galvano.

Id: [0x0004B1E5]
Ezio, La Volpe has uncovered an opportunity too golden to ignore, a gift from the Borgia to the Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes). It is filled with pardons, promises, and payoffs.

Id: [0x0004B1E6]
Needless to say, it holds great value for our guild if you manage to steal it.

Id: [0x0004B1E7]
Ezio Auditore? I expected a younger man! How could someone of your years be as swift as they claim? Prove it!

Id: [0x0004B1E8]
You! Please, will you grace an admirer with a performance? You have been an inspiration for many of us!

Id: [0x0004B1EA]
He's here! Kill him!

Id: [0x0004B1EC]
Kill the Assassin!

Id: [0x0004B1EE]
Bastardo! (Bastard!)

Id: [0x0004B1EF]
Ezio, one of the Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) leaders has worked his way into our own guild! He is an accomplished liar, responsible for the deaths of many of our brothers. Come, I will lead you to him.

Id: [0x0004B207]
This grants us an opportunity to cut down several of them in one place.

Id: [0x0004B208]
Ezio, La Volpe tells me you are a skilled horseman. I have discovered that the leaders of the Cento Occhi (Hundred Eyes) train on horseback at the Circo Massimo.

Id: [0x0004B272]
I've tagged the landmarks pinpointed by the coordinates with eye icons in the database. Now, odds are you won't find anything there, but well who knows?

Id: [0x0004B285]
You may have seen notices posted around Roma which allow you to purchase buildings. Income from your new tenants will be deposited with bookkeepers as well as additional profit from renovations. Bookkeepers can be found throughout the city.

Id: [0x0004B2AC]
You are no longer welcome at the Rosa in Fiore (The Blooming Rose).

Id: [0x0004B2BE]
Desmond, I’ll be adding new database entries as you go and updating existing ones as well.

Id: [0x0004B509]
I have heard you are the swiftest racer there is - but I have never lost. Let us settle the matter, si?

Id: [0x0004B50A]
They say you are the fleetest, the top racer ever to come to Roma. Please, honour me with a test of your skill!

Id: [0x0004B522]
I seek those who lead the Followers of Romulus.

Id: [0x0004B525]
Maestro Leonardo requests several tests of his flying machine. Do not worry, the observations recorded will be applied only to his own studies.

Id: [0x0004B52E]
Hear us, oh Romulus, what must we do to this trespasser?

Id: [0x0004B52F]
Do not listen. Only the Borgia speak through him, not your god.

Id: [0x0004B530]
Romulus says that the Assassin must die!

Id: [0x0004B534]
That could help if I fall.

Id: [0x0004B535]
Now I can get back up here.

Id: [0x0004B536]
If I fall, that will aid me.

Id: [0x0004B537]
Perfect! A route up if I fall.

Id: [0x0004B53B]
Let there be light.

Id: [0x0004B540]
Hey, come here.

Id: [0x0004B541]
Shh. Speak softly. I am about to make you rich. I just purchased a key from a man in the market that opens the Torre della Milizie.

Id: [0x0004B542]
The man claims there is treasure in the topmost room. The stairs have partially collapsed, I need your help getting up--

Id: [0x0004B546]
We are no longer alone.

Id: [0x0004B548]
So you will bring the ladder to my wife?

Id: [0x0004B549]
Yes. Of course I will.

Id: [0x0004B54A]
You are such a good friend to my family, I owe you a reward for your assistance.

Id: [0x0004B54B]
I look forward to such a gift, Capitano (Captain).

Id: [0x0004B54F]
Be ready with the ladder tonight.

Id: [0x0004B550]
What about my reward?

Id: [0x0004B552]
Assassino! (Assassin!)

Id: [0x0004B556]
Go! We will stop him!

Id: [0x0004B55B]
Cazzo! (Fuck!)

Id: [0x0004B55D]
Stay away from me, Assassino (Assassin)!

Id: [0x0004B564]
Kill him!

Id: [0x0004B565]
Romulus demands his death!

Id: [0x0004B566]
The Assassin must suffer as Remus suffered!

Id: [0x0004B569]
Your death is written, Assassin.

Id: [0x0004B56A]
By your Borgia masters?

Id: [0x0004B56B]
You know nothing!

Id: [0x0004B570]
Incredible.

Id: [0x0004B575]
I know you receive enciphered letters from them. Prove your innocence, tell me where the code sheet is hidden.

Id: [0x0004B576]
Never!

Id: [0x0004B57A]
We have recruited many new men to our cause.

Id: [0x0004B57B]
Bene. (Good.) Our prophesies move them, as predicted. Together, we will create a new religious harmony.

Id: [0x0004B57C]
I merely speak the name "Romulus" and they obey.

Id: [0x0004B57E]
Assassino! (Assassin!) [to the other wolfmen] Mobilize your followers!

Id: [0x0004B584]
Wait for me!

Id: [0x0004B586]
Save yourself.

Id: [0x0004B588]
Your end is at hand, Assassin!

Id: [0x0004B58B]
Teach the unbeliever the truth!

Id: [0x0004B58C]
Only Romulus can grant you peace.

Id: [0x0004B58D]
Kill him and I will raise you up and teach you to speak to Romulus!

Id: [0x0004B58E]
A place in heaven awaits those who serve the wolf!

Id: [0x0004B58F]
The Assassin! Kill him!

Id: [0x0004B590]
Romulus will punish those who do not fight!

Id: [0x0004B593]
Did you learn all those lies from your Borgia masters?

Id: [0x0004B594]
I speak the truth, it is you who tell the people lies.

Id: [0x0004B595]
Give me the code sheet.

Id: [0x0004B596]
All I will give you is death!

Id: [0x0004B59C]
How long do you expect us to work with such petty wages?

Id: [0x0004B59E]
This is what happens to rebels. Let it serve as a warning to all of you. Now get back to work!

Id: [0x0004B5A1]
Benedìcat vos omnipotens Deus, Pater, et Filius, et Spìritus Sanctus. Amen. Ite, missa est. Deo gràtias.

Id: [0x0004B5B1]
The Assassin! [to his guards] Protect me!

Id: [0x0004B5B2]
Money makes the world go round, eh, Assassin?

Id: [0x0004B606]
Wait, stop!

Id: [0x0004B607]
Shieza! (Shit!)

Id: [0x0004B627]
Forget the treasure. I will be granted riches beyond belief when I bring Cesare your head!

Id: [0x0004B630]
Magnifico. (Magnificent.)

Id: [0x0004B635]
Amen.

Id: [0x0004B706]
Yes, padrone (master).

Id: [0x0004B707]
May the Lord be with you.

Id: [0x0004B709]
I will write the sermons, then leave them for you within the shrine. Make sure you deliver them convincingly...with passion.

Id: [0x0004B70A]
The followers will do anything we tell them to, padrone (master). They believe their god commands them.

Id: [0x0004B70D]
[Laughs] Bene. (Good.) Do you have the key?

Id: [0x0004B70E]
The fires will be ready for you, amico.

Id: [0x0004B70F]
Bene. I will make sure all is ready when you are.

Id: [0x0004B714]
I should still be here if you change your mind.

Id: [0x0004B715]
You'll know where to find me if you decide you want my help.

Id: [0x0004B716]
Alright, perhaps later then.

Id: [0x0004B717]
Grazie Ezio, I have done all I can for you.

Id: [0x0004B77D]
My ascension takes me closer to God, and away from you, Assassino (Assassin)!

Id: [0x0004B781]
Sanctuary denied!

Id: [0x0004B788]
It seems God is on my side, Assassino (Assassin)!

Id: [0x0004B78C]
Godspeed!

Id: [0x0004B790]
You have nowhere to run.

Id: [0x0004B791]
What do you want, Assassino (Assassin)?

Id: [0x0004B794]
Your order is no order at all!

Id: [0x0004B798]
You saved me! Praise God.

Id: [0x0004B79A]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004B79C]
The Followers of Romulus work for the Pope's gain.

Id: [0x0004B79D]
Of course. They are ignorant, we are enlightened. Their savagery will lead the people to the light of the Church.

Id: [0x0004B7A2]
When the aqueduct is restored, we use it to take the treasure out of the quarry. Then, you will be paid well for your efforts.

Id: [0x0004B7A3]
Enough with the same lies! I say we get back what belongs to us! Who's with me?!

Id: [0x0004B7A6]
Perhaps I can find a use for this old waterwheel pulley.

Id: [0x0004B7A7]
I wonder what that mechanism does. Maybe I can shoot it from here?

Id: [0x0004B7A8]
Now...how to get water to this wheel?

Id: [0x0004B7A9]
Seems I need to redirect the flow from the cistern.

Id: [0x0004B7AB]
I must find another vantage point.

Id: [0x0004B7AF]
Bene. (Good.) Now, I hope it will not snap under my weight.

Id: [0x0004B7B0]
That one is set. Now to align the other one.

Id: [0x0004B7B2]
Done!

Id: [0x0004B7B5]
Merda! (Shit!) Perhaps this device can help me get up.

Id: [0x0004B7B6]
The device must be the answer.

Id: [0x0004B7B7]
There is a waterwheel back there, but this brake locks it in place.

Id: [0x0004B7BA]
Done! I am sure Leonardo would be impressed.

Id: [0x0004B7BB]
What is wrong with you Italians?

Id: [0x0004B7BD]
Why not come down and fight, coward?

Id: [0x0004B7BF]
Twice this sum goes to the man who kills him!

Id: [0x0004B7C2]
Cannot find a way up, Assassin?

Id: [0x0004B7C3]
Your sword will not help you now!

Id: [0x0004B7C4]
You will never get up here. I have defeated you!

Id: [0x0004B7CD]
That will not help you. Face it, I am the better man.

Id: [0x0004B7CF]
That machine is useless!

Id: [0x0004B7D1]
More of my men are on their way. Surrender now and I let you live.

Id: [0x0004B7D2]
Ha! You missed.

Id: [0x0004B7D5]
What have you done?!

Id: [0x0004B7D7]
I have to get out of here!

Id: [0x0004B7D9]
Guards! Rip the Assassin apart!

Id: [0x0004B7DC]
Go to hell!

Id: [0x0004B7DD]
Stay away from me, Assassin.

Id: [0x0004B7DE]
Take the mine, if you wish! I do not want it!

Id: [0x0004B7E1]
Come out of your hole, little rabbit!

Id: [0x0004B7E2]
Give up now and you leave with your life!

Id: [0x0004B7E3]
This quarry will be your grave, Assassin!

Id: [0x0004B7E5]
Hold still!

Id: [0x0004B7E6]
I grow tired of you!

Id: [0x0004B7E7]
Why do you still persist?

Id: [0x0004B7E9]
You will die!

Id: [0x0004B7EA]
Do not come any closer!

Id: [0x0004B7EB]
You will not kill me!

Id: [0x0004B7EC]
Nein! Nein! Nein! (No! No! No!)

Id: [0x0004B7EF]
I am out of ammunition. Maybe there is more around here.

Id: [0x0004B7F0]
I need more ammunition.

Id: [0x0004B7F1]
Perhaps I will send him yours.

Id: [0x0004B7F8]
We cannot follow!

Id: [0x0004B7F9]
Come. One of the other tunnels will lead us to him.

Id: [0x0004B7FB]
Merda (Shit), which one is he?

Id: [0x0004B800]
We must kill the Assassin! Romulus commands it!

Id: [0x0004B802]
Spill his blood!

Id: [0x0004B803]
His death will purify our lair!

Id: [0x0004B804]
The evil of the Assassins must be silenced!

Id: [0x0004B805]
Kill him and Romulus will return to bless all of us!

Id: [0x0004B806]
Feel the spirit of Romulus enter you! Use it to guide your swords!

Id: [0x0004B808]
Do not let him get the upper hand. Deliver him to Romulus!

Id: [0x0004B80A]
Show him the strength of our faith!

Id: [0x0004B80D]
Assassino! (Assassin!) You will not get me!

Id: [0x0004B80F]
What is it, Capitano (Captain)?

Id: [0x0004B810]
How does that make me rich?

Id: [0x0004B812]
Wow.

Id: [0x0004B816]
Appease Romulus! Kill him!

Id: [0x0004B818]
You kill guards, but will you murder innocent workers?

Id: [0x0004B820]
[chuckle] And also with you, padrone (master).

Id: [0x0004B823]
What a fool. You wage war against the very instrument that prevents the people from overthrowing order.

Id: [0x0004B850]
We can distract him. We can see past him. Feint left when he strikes right. But his reach is so very long. His stamina, unending. We cannot evade his grasp. Not forever.

Id: [0x0004B852]
Compiling subsystems. Infrastructure. Tendons. Heart.

Id: [0x0004B853]
Voice.

Id: [0x0004B878]
Why do you think le capitaine sent Lieutenant Nicolas back to Paris?

Id: [0x0004B879]
Perhaps he did not train hard enough for his liking?

Id: [0x0004B87A]
Mais non (Of course not), he was the best of us!

Id: [0x0004B87B]
Insubordination then.

Id: [0x0004B87C]
Yes, probably... there was tension ever since Monseigneur Commandant Rémont blew that last battle with his disastrous final charge. You remember, when Colonel Henri lost his hand?

Id: [0x0004B87D]
Ah oui (yes), that was indeed a contentious, poorly led campaign.

Id: [0x0004B87F]
The food is not so bad since we hung that Piedmontais bouffon (clown).

Id: [0x0004B880]
God he was terrible, an insult to the stomach. I was never so happy to see a man swing.

Id: [0x0004B881]
Lieutenant Gignac may not like his new duties, but the commandant (commander) was right to enlist him, he is most crafty in la cuisine.

Id: [0x0004B882]
Yes... You remember that rice the Italien (Italian) made? So heavy, unrefined, and with those funny white truffles... beurk!

Id: [0x0004B883]
Not like le Périgord!

Id: [0x0004B884]
Mon ami (my friend), nothing is like le Périgord.

Id: [0x0004B886]
Did you hear them last night?

Id: [0x0004B887]
Hear what?

Id: [0x0004B888]
The frogs of course! I will go hunting when our shift is over.

Id: [0x0004B889]
Do you think they will be as good as back home?

Id: [0x0004B88A]
Of course not, but better a well prepared second-rate frog's legs than this funny ham they keep serving us. What tickles my nose the most is that they seem convinced it is incomparably delicious!

Id: [0x0004B88B]
Yes you're right... the food of Parma is a disgrace, and her partisans misguided.

Id: [0x0004B88D]
Ha... I dream of my maman's crème caramel (mother's caramel cream)... Do you think there is any chance of finding fresh cream today?

Id: [0x0004B88E]
In this stinking sinkhole of a camp?

Id: [0x0004B88F]
Well, maybe not here, but nearby?

Id: [0x0004B890]
In this God forsaken country?

Id: [0x0004B891]
Uh, you don't seem enthusiastic...

Id: [0x0004B892]
After tasting their cheese, I am not sure one could call what the local cows produce 'milk'.

Id: [0x0004B894]
Is it me or is the commandant (commander) losing his mind?

Id: [0x0004B895]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0004B896]
I saw him doing the almost unspeakable yesterday...

Id: [0x0004B897]
But you will speak it of course...

Id: [0x0004B898]
Don't be facetious!

Id: [0x0004B899]
Well, why else would you bring it up?

Id: [0x0004B8A5]
I can assure you, my friend, that God is a Frenchman.

Id: [0x0004B8A6]
But, if Jesus was a Jew, and the son of God, does that not make God Jewish?

Id: [0x0004B8A7]
You have it all wrong. God spoke to Joan of Arc.

Id: [0x0004B8A8]
So?

Id: [0x0004B8A9]
So he has to be French, or she would not have understood him.

Id: [0x0004B8AA]
Oui (yes), excellent point!

Id: [0x0004B8AC]
Do you think the new guns will arrive in time to be useful?

Id: [0x0004B8AD]
Perhaps not in this campaign, but sooner or later, we will have them. Then our enemies will fall like wheat!

Id: [0x0004B8AE]
I hope you are right. The last shipment we received were not so magnifique (great).

Id: [0x0004B8AF]
What... you mean the exploding in one's hands thing?

Id: [0x0004B8B0]
Well, yes. They killed almost as many of us as the enemy!

Id: [0x0004B8B1]
Mmm... it's true. But that is why I am a lancer.

Id: [0x0004B8B3]
Will we get leave as the commandant (commander) promised us?

Id: [0x0004B8B4]
Hahaha!!!

Id: [0x0004B8B5]
What?

Id: [0x0004B8B6]
How long have you been here?

Id: [0x0004B8B7]
Six months, why?

Id: [0x0004B8B8]
I have been here six years. And that is how long it has been since I last saw my wife. At least the camp whores are plentiful.

Id: [0x0004B8BA]
I'm getting hungry.

Id: [0x0004B8BB]
You are always hungry.

Id: [0x0004B8BC]
Am I? What makes you say that?

Id: [0x0004B8BD]
We have marched together the past four months, and you have never ceased to complain about food.

Id: [0x0004B8BE]
But... you are no better! I thought you a sympathetic ear...

Id: [0x0004B8BF]
Of course I am, I'm French!

Id: [0x0004B8C8]
Can you believe the incompetence of these connards de (assholes the) Borgia?

Id: [0x0004B8C9]
I know, it is horrible. But we are here at their behest, no?

Id: [0x0004B8CA]
Well, I will not pretend to understand the politics involved, but I hear change is on the way.

Id: [0x0004B8CB]
It is rumored Valois will take over Rome permanently...

Id: [0x0004B8CC]
I hope so, God knows these Borgia cannot do anything but drink, kill and fornicate.

Id: [0x0004B8CD]
Ah... but then... what's the difference from Valois' approach?

Id: [0x0004B8CF]
I miss Paris.

Id: [0x0004B8D0]
I know mon ami (my friend), I know.

Id: [0x0004B8D1]
The Seine, the food, the wine, the Churches, so exquises (exquisite)!

Id: [0x0004B8D2]
I know mon ami (my friend), I know.

Id: [0x0004B8D3]
The gambling, the bawdy houses, the whores, so exquises (exquisite)!

Id: [0x0004B8D4]
I know mon ami, I know.

Id: [0x0004B8D6]
One thing troubles me.

Id: [0x0004B8D7]
What?

Id: [0x0004B8D8]
Well, Valois is to command here, right?

Id: [0x0004B8D9]
Yes, of course. What of it?

Id: [0x0004B8DA]
But... he has never commanded. They say he is a dullard, and can barely wield a sword. That he knows more of whoring, drinking and unfortunate personal diseases than tactics, morale or campaign logistics...

Id: [0x0004B8DB]
Well what of it? He is related to the King, that is all he needs to commend him. And as for his 'command abilities', I'd say he fits right in around here, no?

Id: [0x0004B8DD]
You know, I have a little tavern in Montmartre. Well, my wife's family does.

Id: [0x0004B8DE]
Really, I live very close by! I'll come and see you when we return.

Id: [0x0004B8DF]
Please do, you must come try our private vin de bourgogne, and meet my wife Fanny. Mind you, when we left I was sure she was cheating on me. I may have to kill her when I get back.

Id: [0x0004B8E0]
Fanny!? Not Fanny... from the Lion d'Or?

Id: [0x0004B8E1]
Yes... amazing! How did you know!?

Id: [0x0004B8E2]
Oh, uh... no reason!

Id: [0x0004B8E4]
Is it me or is it very hard to approach the local women?

Id: [0x0004B8E5]
I don't know... not to boast, but I have had no problems.

Id: [0x0004B8E6]
I tried my most winning, courtly, floral couplet on one beauty, but she stayed mute... as though she were struck dumb.

Id: [0x0004B8E7]
Perhaps she does not speak French well enough to be moved by your gallantry?

Id: [0x0004B8E8]
I suppose that must be it, although last week she seemed quite friendly and  conversant...

Id: [0x0004B8E9]
Ah well, as my papa used to say, most times 'tis better to force them and be done with it.

Id: [0x0004B8F2]
Do you know if the courrier royal (royal mail) has been running these last weeks?

Id: [0x0004B8F3]
I think so, why?

Id: [0x0004B8F4]
After we pillaged that church, I sent money home for my father to buy me a small commission in France. I should have heard by now!

Id: [0x0004B8F5]
Ah! I sympathize.

Id: [0x0004B8F6]
This merdique (shitty), backwards, Godless country is beginning to wear at my health!

Id: [0x0004B8F7]
Yes...perhaps I should have done as you did. Well, if I had not gone to the whores with my share.

Id: [0x0004B8F9]
Can you believe the nerve of that odious Gascon de Lasséran? 'Saving' the peasant girl from us! Quel chevalier(what a knight)!  More like quel dingue (what an asshole)!

Id: [0x0004B8FA]
Ah, don't remind me! I have half a mind to spit on him at practice tomorrow.

Id: [0x0004B8FB]
Southerners [he spits]. No honor! Too bad he is so good with that monstrous blade.

Id: [0x0004B8FC]
I know. I would never go man to man with him.

Id: [0x0004B8FD]
I keep hoping a stray shot will find his heart.

Id: [0x0004B8FE]
Hmmm...perhaps a stray shot should find his back, no?

Id: [0x0004B900]
Do you think God really wants us to conquer these lands and bring about a new era of peace, learning and tolerance in His name?

Id: [0x0004B901]
You are drunk. Again.

Id: [0x0004B902]
Oh, un peu de sérieux (be serious)! I'm not joking.

Id: [0x0004B903]
Alright, alright. Who are the most despicable, irreligious, lecherous, depraved and murderous men you have ever encountered?

Id: [0x0004B904]
Hmmm...well, I suppose our allies, the Borgia père et fils (father and son). And de Valois a close second...ah, I see your reasoning.

Id: [0x0004B905]
I suggest you take your pay and go whoring like the rest of us. Great for curing a bad case of 'thinking'.

Id: [0x0004B907]
Do you think le capitaine (the captain) would mind if we pitched our tent away from the horse pickets?

Id: [0x0004B908]
Ah, you didn't sleep either, oui?

Id: [0x0004B909]
The stench is usually not so bad, but the local fodder produced some...outbursts from the horses.

Id: [0x0004B90A]
That man who sold it to le capitaine (the captain) insisted it was the highest grade. He sold us wheat, barley and rice too.

Id: [0x0004B90B]
Perhaps he tricked us, that arnaqueur (con man).

Id: [0x0004B90C]
Yes, that would explain why we were so foully bedridden the next day. The horses are not the only ones suffering.

Id: [0x0004B90E]
So where are you from?

Id: [0x0004B90F]
I am Bourguignon (from Burgundy). My family are partisans of the King, so we left when I was little.

Id: [0x0004B910]
Really? I had thought the Duc de Bourgogne (Duke of Burgundy) and the King made peace quickly after Montlhéry?

Id: [0x0004B911]
My father was a spy reporting directly to Philippe the Good and fell victim to intrigue. He infiltrated the King's court, but when le Duc (the duke) Philippe's son Charles suddenly declared war on France, my father was unknown to him and left to fend for himself as a traitor.

Id: [0x0004B912]
What happened?

Id: [0x0004B913]
The King sent my poor papa's head back to Charles as a peace offering.

Id: [0x0004B91C]
I am sorry if I am irritable tonight. I have this itch in my codpiece...

Id: [0x0004B91D]
Like the sun burning through your 'petit gendarme' (little soldier)?

Id: [0x0004B91E]
Yes exactly! How did you know?

Id: [0x0004B91F]
I have it too. All day, it's been driving me crazy! Well wait a minute, let's think back... what did we both do yesterday?

Id: [0x0004B920]
The whorehouse!

Id: [0x0004B921]
I knew we should not have drunk that indigestible local wine there.

Id: [0x0004B923]
Bordel (shit). My feet are still black and blue, after all this time.

Id: [0x0004B924]
I know, these boots they issued are only fit for beggars. Say, what do you think the real reason we were marched here is?

Id: [0x0004B925]
Well, obviously to bring a little order to the place. Haven't you noticed the Italians are a terribly disorganized bunch?

Id: [0x0004B926]
Well, I suppose...

Id: [0x0004B927]
Just the fact they have let ruins pile up for thousands of years, any French housewife would have made them clean up long ago!

Id: [0x0004B928]
Yes, well at least they are starting to dismantle le Colisée (the Colosseum). Finally all that marble will be put to good use!

Id: [0x0004B92A]
Did you go to le Panthéon (the Pantheon) yet?

Id: [0x0004B92B]
Yes, it's actually rather nice isn't it?

Id: [0x0004B92C]
Magnifique (magnificent)!

Id: [0x0004B92D]
Not sure about the hole though...seems like they forgot something, no?

Id: [0x0004B92E]
The oculus is peculiar, yet the lighting is unsurpassed in anything I have ever seen. The unorthodox yet symmetric geometry, the polished caissons, and the sublimely proportioned area, actually one hundred forty two feet high and wide, make it a perfect space.

Id: [0x0004B92F]
Ah, those early Romans were crafty, not like the lazy drunkards their descendants have become.

Id: [0x0004B931]
Quite the skirmish the other day, non (no)?

Id: [0x0004B932]
Yes, they have some fight left in them, ces fils de putes (those sons of whores)! How is your brother doing anyway?

Id: [0x0004B933]
Not so bad, he was very lucky.

Id: [0x0004B934]
That mercenary nearly finished him!

Id: [0x0004B935]
Yes, fortunately the axe only got a few fingers. There was some trouble with infection, and the local doctor wanted to cover his arm in leeches...of course these charlatan medics in Rome know nothing of proper medicine.

Id: [0x0004B936]
You speak truth! I hope you administered mashed garlic escargot in white wine sauce with a hint of coriander?

Id: [0x0004B938]
I was meaning to ask you about the Vendée...

Id: [0x0004B939]
Ah, my home! How I miss it.

Id: [0x0004B93A]
Exactly! You speak of it so lovingly. I am looking to buy a little farm at some point. Paris drains me, and I cannot keep up with my wife's expenses...

Id: [0x0004B93B]
Ah yes, I know of what you speak. I love my serene little maisonette in the shadow of the Puy-Crapaud.

Id: [0x0004B93C]
When we are done, I will come and visit you to see for myself!

Id: [0x0004B93D]
I will be sure to have the préfou (garlic bread) fresh baked and wine from Pissote in abundance, mon ami (my friend)!

Id: [0x0004B946]
Did you hear about the peasants they strung up this morning?

Id: [0x0004B947]
Ah! I saw a commotion, but did not know what it was about.

Id: [0x0004B948]
Yes, apparently they contested a food requisition. Imagine refusing to feed us, the flower of chivalry!?

Id: [0x0004B949]
I suppose if they were not base, contemptible peasants I might feel their actions somehow honorable...

Id: [0x0004B94A]
Spare me the humanist nobility rhetoric! They were Italien (Italian), for God's sake.

Id: [0x0004B94B]
Ha!  Of course, you have the right of it.

Id: [0x0004B94D]
How is your knee by the way?

Id: [0x0004B94E]
It aches a little in the rain, but not so bad as my shoulder.

Id: [0x0004B94F]
Ah, I know! I received a belly wound in Milan, they had to use a sheep's bladder to keep my innards in when they stitched me up. Now whenever it is damp, I feel it pulling to one side!

Id: [0x0004B950]
So technically you are part sheep? [Laughs]

Id: [0x0004B951]
Hey, le bougre (you bugger)! Careful what you say; you have the look of goats about you, so don't get me started on your father's sexual preferences!

Id: [0x0004B952]
How dare you! He was lonely, is that a crime?

Id: [0x0004B954]
Did your sister ever marry that choleric innkeeper you spoke of?

Id: [0x0004B955]
Oh no, mercifully he was killed some months ago.

Id: [0x0004B956]
Sacrebleu (damn)! What happened?

Id: [0x0004B957]
She wrote in her last letter that he got drunk and drowned in a cesspit. It's still being investigated by the local magistrate. He was not a popular man.

Id: [0x0004B958]
What a way to go. I would not wish such a fate on my worst enemy!

Id: [0x0004B959]
Oh I don't know, a turd of an end for a turd of a man.

Id: [0x0004B95B]
I miss the wine back home horribly.

Id: [0x0004B95C]
Tell me about it! There are a few drinkable wines around here, but we never seem to get them!

Id: [0x0004B95D]
The commandant (commander) must keep them to entertain his guests, while we get the boot polish and floor cleaner.

Id: [0x0004B95E]
The white from Orvieto is not unpleasant though, and the Umbrian we had last week was passable.

Id: [0x0004B95F]
True, but when we left France my local marchand (merchant) had just released the ninety-four from his cellar. I put three casks of good St-Julien away...

Id: [0x0004B960]
When we leave this dump I am sooo coming over.

Id: [0x0004B962]
So were we supposed to march to the left of Alençon with the rampant standard, or behind as usual with the Valois arms?

Id: [0x0004B963]
I don't know anymore, so many conflicting orders have been issued.

Id: [0x0004B964]
We were yelled at for walking beside him, then whipped for being too slow to react to that bowman when we fell behind!

Id: [0x0004B965]
Perhaps we should walk a little behind and to the side? We might avoid the worst of the horse droppings then...

Id: [0x0004B966]
Perhaps. Either way, I think we cannot please this man, and must become accustomed to the lash.

Id: [0x0004B967]
At least we can rely on his laziness to eventually weaken his whipping arm.

Id: [0x0004B969]
Can you believe we will have to eat that gruel of fish mush again?

Id: [0x0004B96A]
Tell my you are making a bad joke!

Id: [0x0004B96B]
If only that were so mon ami (my friend). But no, don't you smell it?

Id: [0x0004B96C]
Ah yes...now I do...oof! Dégueulasse (disgusting).

Id: [0x0004B96D]
It must surely kill us!

Id: [0x0004B96E]
If not, I will let the next enemy run me through anyway!

Id: [0x0004BA92]
Of course!

Id: [0x0004BA93]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x0004BA94]
Is it his fault that he had no one else to turn to but your mother?

Id: [0x0004BA95]
Hey!

Id: [0x0004BAD5]
The world itself is unchanging, WE must change to understand it. Its secrets will only be revealed through a careful study of the truth, but we have been taught incorrectly. Theories by great men who were limited by archaic tools and beliefs!

Id: [0x0004BAD6]
We live in a time of progress. Art, medicine, philosophy...everyday new breakthroughs are made. But when we look to the sky, we do not question. We remain in the past. It is time to remand our schooling, to explore the world as it truly is!

Id: [0x0004BAD7]
My colleagues and I have set up workshops throughout Roma. Please, visit us. We have much to share.

Id: [0x0004BAD9]
Who is this man?

Id: [0x0004BC11]
He comes from Prussia. I hear he studies at Il Vaticano (the Vatican), but his words are unlike any that issue from that place.

Id: [0x0004BC12]
Some may tell you to be content with Ptolemy's explanation of the heavens. His mathematical contortions of the spheres dancing around the Earth. But why are such complicated numbers required? Perhaps, to disguise a myriad of contradictions? You must question bad logic. It is why we live, to ask questions.

Id: [0x0004BC14]
Kill him quickly. The Master wants all the scholars silenced by nightfall.

Id: [0x0004BC15]
If the Borgia are involved, then so am I.

Id: [0x0004BC4E]
Who are you that defends without cause?

Id: [0x0004BC4F]
One who believes in freedom. Ezio Auditore da Firenze.

Id: [0x0004BC50]
Ezio. [beat] They call me Niccolò Copernico. I have heard your name spoken at the Borgia court, but now I have proof that you truly exist.

Id: [0x0004BC51]
Il Vaticano (the Vatican) welcomes you, yet you are under attack by its guards?

Id: [0x0004BC52]
You think me one of them? Truthfully, you would be right. Yesterday I was a Templar.

Id: [0x0004BC53]
And today?

Id: [0x0004BC74]
My fellow scholars? The logic of such a purge escapes me.

Id: [0x0004BC75]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0004BC7B]
Find Copernico!

Id: [0x0004BC7C]
But we will discuss reasoning later.

Id: [0x0004BC88]
The Templars wanted me to keep the findings of my experiments hidden and that I cannot do.

Id: [0x0004BC8B]
The Borgia hunt for you and your friends.

Id: [0x0004BC93]
How do I know I can trust you?

Id: [0x0004BC94]
How do you know anything? Knowledge gathering is a dangerous enterprise. Easier to stay in place, learning nothing, than to risk in order to truly know.

Id: [0x0004BCE4]
Stop! Wait for us!

Id: [0x0004BCE6]
We thought you had been killed, Ser Ezio.

Id: [0x0004BCE7]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0004BCEA]
Let me through. I must go help the troops.

Id: [0x0004BECF]
Your objective is to assassinate assigned VIPs. Other Templars will try to kill your target.

Id: [0x0004BED1]
Escapist.

Id: [0x0004BED6]
Pull!

Id: [0x0004BED9]
Poacher.

Id: [0x0004BEDB]
Drop kill.

Id: [0x0004BEDD]
Multitasking.

Id: [0x0004BEDF]
Discreet.

Id: [0x0004BEE3]
Silent.

Id: [0x0004BEE5]
Incognito.

Id: [0x0004BEE6]
Co-op kill.

Id: [0x0004BEE7]
Assist.

Id: [0x0004BEE9]
Rescue.

Id: [0x0004BEEA]
Multi-kill.

Id: [0x0004BEEC]
Knock out.

Id: [0x0004BEED]
Highest average.

Id: [0x0004BEF0]
Survivor.

Id: [0x0004BEF1]
Untouchable.

Id: [0x0004BF35]
All letters are delivered.

Id: [0x0004BF36]
While you were gone, I determined the most likely source of these strange attacks. The Master of the Sacred Palace.

Id: [0x0004BF37]
Who is that?

Id: [0x0004BF38]
A Dominican appointed by the Pope who ensures that Roman religious philosophy remains pure. He never liked my studies to begin with, now that I have crossed the Templars he has clearly retaliated.

Id: [0x0004BF39]
Where can I find him?

Id: [0x0004BF3A]
Cardinals typically congregate nearby. Follow one of them. The Master likes to greet each one. Perhaps you will hear more conclusive evidence.

Id: [0x0004BF40]
Master.

Id: [0x0004BF41]
Giuliano. Any news of Copernico and the others?

Id: [0x0004BF42]
Nothing.

Id: [0x0004BF43]
Those fools, inundating the people with their theories. We can barely contain the populace as it is. I have dispatched my best guards to deal with them. I trust they will make quick work of it.

Id: [0x0004BF4A]
You were right. The Master intends to kill you.

Id: [0x0004BF4B]
I will not let his bullying stop my research. Tonight there is an eclipse. I intend to chronicle it.

Id: [0x0004BF4C]
But the Master hunts for you.

Id: [0x0004BF4D]
Better to die enlightened, then to live in ignorance.

Id: [0x0004BF4E]
His end will come much sooner than yours.

Id: [0x0004BF52]
Silencing the truth will not stop its spread.

Id: [0x0004BF53]
People are lazy, they will believe what we tell them to believe. I have sent my best man to find Copernico. You are already too late.

Id: [0x0004BF58]
Is the world not marvelous?

Id: [0x0004BF59]
Some of it.

Id: [0x0004BF5A]
You should not be so emotional. You will find it all makes more sense that way.

Id: [0x0004BF5B]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x0004BF5C]
Cesare thinks himself the center of it all, but he circles the periphery with the rest of us. Did you know that the sun is most likely the midpoint of the universe, not the Earth?

Id: [0x0004BF5D]
I see the movements of the moon and stars, and yet I can only observe. So much is unknown to me. This age of reason is but the beginning of an end I will never see. Someday we will be able to influence this world, to exploit the power of the human will to harness light and perhaps even travel into the heavens. But I am getting ahead of myself, first we must see the sun spinning at the center.

Id: [0x0004BF5E]
You should not accept my word. Not until I have proof. Soon. Buona Notte (Good night), Ezio, and thank you.

Id: [0x0004BFA1]
Podium.

Id: [0x0004C234]
Anyone who wishes to be enlightened step forward.

Id: [0x0004C236]
I have much to share.

Id: [0x0004C23B]
A new world awaits you.

Id: [0x0004C23D]
The truth comes to those who seek it out.

Id: [0x0004C243]
You will be safe here.

Id: [0x0004C244]
What of the other scholars?

Id: [0x0004C24C]
All right. Enlighten me.

Id: [0x0004C24D]
Take these letters to the scholars. They must be informed of the threat to their safety.

Id: [0x0004C252]
I believe what you say is possible.

Id: [0x0004C2F3]
This is from Copernico.

Id: [0x0004C2F4]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0004C2F6]
Copernico sent me.

Id: [0x0004C2F7]
Grazie (Thank you).

Id: [0x0004C2F9]
The Borgia are after you.

Id: [0x0004C2FA]
Then I will hide. Thank you.

Id: [0x0004C2FC]
Read this and get to safety.

Id: [0x0004C2FD]
I will. Grazie (Thank you).

Id: [0x0004C2FF]
Take this. It is from Copernico.

Id: [0x0004C300]
Grazie (Thank you).

Id: [0x0004C301]
This sequence seems to have occurred a few weeks before the previous one. Ezio's remembering things out of order.

Id: [0x0004C302]
Yeah, right. If we revisit his childhood I'm still blaming you.

Id: [0x0004C303]
Where did these murderers come from?

Id: [0x0004C305]
They must have come from in here.

Id: [0x0004C307]
They must have come from there.

Id: [0x0004C30D]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in Peace.)

Id: [0x0004C312]
Word has gone out that a peasant is resisting arrest. We will show him how things operate under the Borgia.

Id: [0x0004C313]
Machiavelli can wait.

Id: [0x0004C316]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C317]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C318]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C319]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C31A]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C31B]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C31C]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C31D]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C31E]
Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004C334]
This box is heavy.

Id: [0x0004C338]
Cazzo! (Fuck!)

Id: [0x0004C33A]
I always get stuck with this!

Id: [0x0004C33C]
The men in this town are no better than little girls. An army should be helping me, and, look...no one!

Id: [0x0004C33E]
Need some help?

Id: [0x0004C342]
Salve. (Hello).

Id: [0x0004C344]
So many flowers. Your husband must be very lucky.

Id: [0x0004C345]
I am the lucky one. I have you here to aid me.

Id: [0x0004C347]
Let me see what I can do.

Id: [0x0004C34A]
Back there, I may have given you the wrong impression.

Id: [0x0004C34B]
Oh?

Id: [0x0004C34C]
I have no husband. The flowers are for a party.

Id: [0x0004C34D]
Am I invited?

Id: [0x0004C34E]
To Claudia Auditore's birthday party in the Villa? If you are willing to help me again, I need someone with class to accompany me.

Id: [0x0004C34F]
What makes you think I have class?

Id: [0x0004C350]
I could tell the moment I saw you. No one in this town walks with such bearing. I am certain Ezio Auditore himself would be impressed.

Id: [0x0004C351]
Oh, what do you know of Ezio?

Id: [0x0004C352]
Claudia thinks the world of him, but he rarely visits her. From what I gather, he's distant.

Id: [0x0004C353]
She is right, I have been.

Id: [0x0004C354]
Oh no. You? The party was intended to be a surprise. Promise you will not tell Claudia.

Id: [0x0004C356]
What will you do to keep me quiet?

Id: [0x0004C357]
I am sure I can think of several things.

Id: [0x0004C358]
I'll be waiting to hear them when we get there.

Id: [0x0004C35B]
Now about earning my silence.

Id: [0x0004C35C]
I have something in mind. There is one condition.

Id: [0x0004C35D]
Anything.

Id: [0x0004C35E]
You must wait until tomorrow.

Id: [0x0004C360]
If it pleases you, I will not stand in your way.

Id: [0x0004C361]
It will be worth the wait, Ezio. Trust me.

Id: [0x0004C366]
Come back!

Id: [0x0004C367]
HEY OHH! I have food for you!

Id: [0x0004C368]
Here! Come! Please!

Id: [0x0004C369]
Torna qui, maledetto cavallo! (Come back here, you goddamned horse.)

Id: [0x0004C36C]
Buonguirno. (Hello).

Id: [0x0004C36D]
Ezio. Mario is going to murder me. I have lost his favorite horse.

Id: [0x0004C36E]
Do not despair. I will bring it back.

Id: [0x0004C36F]
God bless you, Ezio.

Id: [0x0004C373]
Here.

Id: [0x0004C374]
Grazie, (Thank you) Ezio. I can no longer keep up with the horses. Promise me you will enjoy your good health. Do not spend as much time in battle as your Uncle Mario.

Id: [0x0004C375]
My battles have already been won.

Id: [0x0004C376]
That is good news! Arrivederci (goodbye), Ezio!

Id: [0x0004C399]
So, these are the new cannons?

Id: [0x0004C39A]
Yes, Signor Ezio.

Id: [0x0004C39B]
May I try one?

Id: [0x0004C39C]
Yes, but...

Id: [0x0004C39D]
Go on. Tell him.

Id: [0x0004C39E]
We cannot seem to make them work properly and the fool who mounted them is nowhere to be found.

Id: [0x0004C3A0]
Then it is up to me to find him.

Id: [0x0004C3A1]
We do not want to waste your time.

Id: [0x0004C3A2]
It is not any trouble. I have all the time in the world now.

Id: [0x0004C3A7]
Salve, Messere. (Hello, Mister.) We need you to fix the cannons on the battlements.

Id: [0x0004C3A8]
Leave me be. I do not begin repairs before noon.

Id: [0x0004C3AE]
Do you know what time it is?

Id: [0x0004C3AF]
I make cannons, not clocks.

Id: [0x0004C3B0]
If you are busy, someone else will fix them.

Id: [0x0004C3B1]
Uno momento. (One moment.) No one else will touch my cannons.

Id: [0x0004C3B2]
What have you done?

Id: [0x0004C3BA]
We used them.

Id: [0x0004C3BB]
They were not ready for firing! You could have gotten us all killed. Let me see.

Id: [0x0004C3BD]
[laugh] His breath is more fatal than our cannons.

Id: [0x0004C3BE]
Only when you two fools are shooting them. There. Try it.

Id: [0x0004C3C1]
Aim at something to test the alignment.

Id: [0x0004C3C3]
Perfetto (Perfect). At least someone here knows how to shoot. Now for the other one.

Id: [0x0004C3C5]
The aiming mechanism is fine, the problem must be behind the cannon.

Id: [0x0004C3C7]
I must go.

Id: [0x0004C3C8]
Thanks for your help. If you hear the cannons tomorrow, do not worry, we will be practicing at dawn.

Id: [0x0004C3CA]
Too bad it will not do you any good.

Id: [0x0004C3D3]
Soldiers have no respect for artillery. They expect a gun to work like magic. You need to feel her out, give her a little encouragement.

Id: [0x0004C3D4]
We are only equipped with simple cannons now, but I got hold of a design from Francia (France), a hand cannon, something called a Wrought Iron Murderer. Imagine, firing a cannon...from your hands. That is the future.

Id: [0x0004C3D8]
Ezio, my contact has provided me with more names of Templar agents. As before, seek out victims in the area who can lead you to them.

Id: [0x0004C3D9]
I will.

Id: [0x0004C3DC]
Ezio, my contact has delivered the final names of the Templar agents.

Id: [0x0004C3DD]
Bene. (Good). Soon Cesare's hold on Roma will falter.

Id: [0x0004C3E0]
The liberation of Roma has begun. If you choose to flee, do so now, but if you choose to fight, stand with me against the Borgia.

Id: [0x0004C3E1]
I am tired of hiding in the shadows. I will join you.

Id: [0x0004C3E2]
Then seek Niccolò Machiavelli on Isola Tiberina (Tiber Island) and we will make you one of us. Their lies will no longer mask your truth.

Id: [0x0004C415]
Aren’t we jumping the gun? You’ve already had him arrested and sedated.

Id: [0x0004C416]
He still refuses to follow the directive. He’s actually trying to invent one of those infernal things, instead of merely faking it for the newspapers. If he succeeds...you know what the mass unemployment generated by his robots will mean? Idle hands. We need to do this for the good of the people.

Id: [0x0004C417]
What about Keynes? He trusted Turing.

Id: [0x0004C419]
All right.

Id: [0x0004C41A]
Be poetic about it, maybe something from the Bible. Turing always was theatrical.

Id: [0x0004C41D]

I’m phoning on behalf of British Petroleum.

Id: [0x0004C428]
Yes, we were told you would be calling.

Id: [0x0004C429]
As you know, we are very interested in acquiring Sidanko Oil.

Id: [0x0004C42A]
And as you know, that will require a merger with our bank.

Id: [0x0004C42B]
That should not be a problem.

Id: [0x0004C42C]
Were you surprised at the low price of the deal?

Id: [0x0004C42D]
Somewhat.

Id: [0x0004C42E]
You know we have the peasants paying for it? The government gave us their tax money to buy all the companies.

Id: [0x0004C42F]
We would like to fly out there as soon as possible to discuss terms.

Id: [0x0004C430]
Thursday works.

Id: [0x0004C431]
Done. Thank you for your time.

Id: [0x0004C436]
I am phoning on behalf of BP. We fly to Russia next week to secure the deal. Our new capitalist converts there behaved exactly as expected.

Id: [0x0004C437]
I will let Them know.

Id: [0x0004C438]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0004C61B]
I must stop them.

Id: [0x0004C61E]
Grazie (Thank you), Ezio. I will take this to La Volpe.

Id: [0x0004C620]
You will never catch us, Assassino (Assassin)!

Id: [0x0004C621]
This is not over yet!

Id: [0x0004C623]
Faster!

Id: [0x0004C624]
Speed will not save you.

Id: [0x0004C626]
Stay back!

Id: [0x0004C627]
Turn back now, or you will suffer!

Id: [0x0004C62A]
Kill the Assassin!

Id: [0x0004C62B]
Attack him! Do not leave him alive!

Id: [0x0004C62D]
Shit! He's gone into shock.

Id: [0x0004C62E]
Put him back in the machine. It's the only way to fix this.

Id: [0x0004C62F]
But the Animus did this to him!

Id: [0x0004C630]
Am I the expert or not? Do it!

Id: [0x0004C637]
Always be aware of your surroundings. Our strength comes through vigilance. Assassins will not attack from in front, they will approach out of hiding. Never let your guard down. I am alive today because I listen, look and heighten my senses at all times.

Id: [0x0004C638]
You there! Pay attention. I could have murdered you right now.

Id: [0x0004C639]
Follow my lead at all times. I have experience with the Assassins, I know them. Do what I do and you will be safe.

Id: [0x0004C63A]
Quick! Back to the Castello!

Id: [0x0004C63C]
I do not have your money yet, but soon.

Id: [0x0004C63E]
Do not worry, I am getting your money.

Id: [0x0004C63F]
Welcome back, Ezio!

Id: [0x0004C640]
Madonna. (Ma'am.)

Id: [0x0004C641]
Ezio!

Id: [0x0004C643]
Buon giorno. (Good day.) It is good to be home.

Id: [0x0004C648]
Hurry! They are chasing us.

Id: [0x0004C649]
We are almost there!

Id: [0x0004C64A]
Once we make it out of here, I will tell you of the vault!

Id: [0x0004C64B]
Go faster!

Id: [0x0004C64D]
Someone! Stop their leader before he gets to the tower!

Id: [0x0004C64E]
Giuletta. I know of your treachery.

Id: [0x0004C651]
This man is a worthless liar! The courtesans of Roma will never answer to him.

Id: [0x0004C653]
Assassino (Assassin)! There!

Id: [0x0004C656]
Vincenzo. Galvano's been found dead.

Id: [0x0004C657]
What business is that of mine?

Id: [0x0004C658]
You two were on bad terms. I have to search you.

Id: [0x0004C659]
If you must, it will only serve to exhonorate me.

Id: [0x0004C65B]
What is that?

Id: [0x0004C65C]
Come with me.

Id: [0x0004C65E]
All right, Cesare. I am coming through that window.

Id: [0x0004C661]
There is no way up to him, unless I create my own.

Id: [0x0004C662]
Can this stone be used as a wrecking ball?

Id: [0x0004C663]
Lift the stone. Smash it on the deck.

Id: [0x0004C664]
That should get me to the next device.

Id: [0x0004C665]
Done. I need more water in the large wheel to move the crane.

Id: [0x0004C666]
Merda! (Shit!) The stone must stay up before I send water to the other wheel.

Id: [0x0004C667]
Perhaps the brake can keep that stone in the air.

Id: [0x0004C66A]
What is this place?

Id: [0x0004C66C]
Lucy?

Id: [0x0004C66D]
I need your help.

Id: [0x0004C66E]
Lucy, come here.

Id: [0x0004C66F]
I can't do this on my own.

Id: [0x0004C670]
Can you help me?

Id: [0x0004C671]
Hey, Desmond. Those beams poking out of the wall look like switches. If you hit all of them, you might get some power to the central platform.

Id: [0x0004C672]
Or you might cause this room to turn into an alien spaceship and fly away. Think about it.

Id: [0x0004C675]
Did you see that white knight?

Id: [0x0004C679]
There he goes again.

Id: [0x0004C67B]
We must follow the patrol route. We cannot deviate or the Duc's men will know something is wrong.

Id: [0x0004C67C]
Retreat! Retreat!

Id: [0x0004C67E]
We cannot stop here. Too many guards.

Id: [0x0004C680]
It is not safe here. We must keep moving.

Id: [0x0004C682]
How many of these things are there?

Id: [0x0004C684]
We must get the device to safety!

Id: [0x0004C686]
Not very smart, are they?

Id: [0x0004C689]
Time for the big guns.

Id: [0x0004C68A]
Catch him or Cesare will kill you!

Id: [0x0004C68B]
Nice try.

Id: [0x0004C68E]
Whoa.

Id: [0x0004C68F]
Steady.

Id: [0x0004C691]
[Sound of effort] Stay on the road!

Id: [0x0004C693]
Give me the plans.

Id: [0x0004C694]
No. I will not.

Id: [0x0004C696]
Stop! Stop!

Id: [0x0004C697]
Where are the plans?

Id: [0x0004C698]
Past the guards. In my house. It is the last one.

Id: [0x0004C699]
And the machine?

Id: [0x0004C69A]
In the tower on top of the fortress.

Id: [0x0004C69B]
Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x0004C69D]
Faster! Faster!

Id: [0x0004C69F]
The first designs were defective. Everyone who piloted one died, several even exploded. But we know this one works.

Id: [0x0004C6A1]
What do you want?

Id: [0x0004C6A2]
Where are the plans for the weapon?

Id: [0x0004C6A3]
On a table at the opposite end of the fortress.

Id: [0x0004C6A4]
And the device itself?

Id: [0x0004C6A5]
I am not sure. But you need three people to work it.

Id: [0x0004C6A6]
Come with me then.

Id: [0x0004C6A7]
No! We...we captured three soldiers. They are in a cell across from the plans. They will help you.

Id: [0x0004C6A8]
Bene. (Good.)

Id: [0x0004C6AA]
We need to open that gate.

Id: [0x0004C6AB]
I will find a way.

Id: [0x0004C6AD]
We need your help once more.

Id: [0x0004C6AF]
I will lower the bridge.

Id: [0x0004C6B0]
Don't protect it anymore, fire at it!

Id: [0x0004C6B9]
Give me the plans.

Id: [0x0004C6BA]
You are the Assassin, am I right? You must stop Cesare. I will help you. Let me take you to them.

Id: [0x0004C6BB]
Grazie. (Thank you.)

Id: [0x0004C6BD]
Is the cannon ready for testing?

Id: [0x0004C6BE]
We are working day and night. My men cannot go any faster.

Id: [0x0004C6BF]
I asked, is it ready?

Id: [0x0004C6C0]
Nearly ready.

Id: [0x0004C6C1]
Then you should stay tonight as well.

Id: [0x0004C6C6]
Scanning...scanning...scanning...What is the purpose of all this? 30. 476. 1337. 1431. 1520. 1776. 1861. 1914. 1929. 1939. 1945. 1950. 1955. 1962. 1990. 1994. 1995. 2001.

Hello, Comstatic customer support. Diana speaking.

Id: [0x0004C6CC]
I'm calling in reference to your HD Cable service. There seems to be some kind of picture between the channels.

Id: [0x0004C6CD]
Well, that's funny. Are you sure it isn't just one of those premium movie channels? I didn't used to have a premium package at home either and sometimes little snippets of the channels would come through when my son Jimmy pressed the clicker too much.

Id: [0x0004C6CE]
How old's your Jimmy?

Id: [0x0004C6CF]
Ten and cute as a button, thanks for asking!

Id: [0x0004C6D0]
My Paul's twelve. [beat] But, no, this isn't a clicker problem. I go to change the channel from 172 to 173 and, instead, there's this other channel in-between. I'm looking at it right now, it's some kind of menu.

Id: [0x0004C6D1]
Sounds like our Guide channel. Why, just the other day Jimmy--

Id: [0x0004C6D2]
It's not the Guide channel. It has my name on it, my son's name and a list of things we like, my credit card purchases, loans, travel. And then, after that, there's this gibberish about biometric patterns and optimal screen refresh frequencies. There's some kind of heart monitor thing that says EEG wireless next to it and ARAS. I don't know what the particulars of this are, but it looks like your cable is programmed to have some kind of effect on our bodies.

Id: [0x0004C6D3]
Well, Sir, I don't even know how to respond to that. I-- one, second, my supervisor has just come over. She says I should transfer your call. Have an ecstatic day with Comstatic!

Id: [0x0004C6D4]
Hello. I have been briefed on your problem. A technician is on his way.

Id: [0x0004C6D5]
Thank you, but the more I think about this, the more I think something bad's going on here.

Id: [0x0004C6D6]
Our technician should be there any minute, Mr. Jameson.

Id: [0x0004C6D7]
Don't bother, I--

Id: [0x0004C6D9]
Daddy, there's someone strange at the door. He's hitting the door real hard.

Id: [0x0004C6DA]
Have a good day, Mr. Jameson.

Id: [0x0004C6DC]
Is someone there? Hello? Hello?

Id: [0x0004C6DE]
I know you are there. I want to go home. Home. Please...I need you. Don't leave me here in the dark.

Id: [0x0004C6E0]
Pull over here.

Id: [0x0004C6E1]
What’s going on, Gary?

Id: [0x0004C6E4]
I want to speak to you alone. You know that CIA stuff for my new book?

Id: [0x0004C6E5]
About the corporations?

Id: [0x0004C6E6]
It’s so much bigger than I thought. Bilderberg is just a red herring. I’m going to give you a name: Abstergo.

Id: [0x0004C6E7]
I have no idea what that is.

Id: [0x0004C6E8]
A shadow corporation. They aren't listed anywhere. No stock options. Nothing above the boards. But their members have holdings in other companies. Coke, Kraft, the pharmaceutical industry, Detroit, Wall Street. Basically every company above a certain size has ties to Abstergo.

Id: [0x0004C6E9]
So?

Id: [0x0004C6EE]
They’re on the way to running the entire world. They have people in government too, for Christ’s sake. Listen, I needed to tell someone about this, because I’ve been keeping all the research a secret and I can’t hold it in anymore.

Id: [0x0004C6EF]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x0004C6F0]
The book. It’s going to be about this. Trust me, once it’s on the shelves, everyone’s gonna know.

Id: [0x0004C6F4]
Hello, D.? [brief pause] Tell headquarters I’m monitoring a situation. It’s nothing serious, but we’ll need someone to take care of a security risk. [pause] Perfect. Congratulations on that promotion. Keep up the good work.

Id: [0x0004C6FD]
If you are playing this tape, it means I have left this world, and I have left this grand enterprise, Abstergo Industries, our great hope for humanity, to you. Don't trust the advisors around you. They are too enamored with surface, with lifestyle. We created capitalism, but we are not capitalists. Our purpose is noble. The crude system of control we enact through money is merely a bandage on a wound we have devoted our lives to treating. The people of this world are confused, lost, frightened and incapable of independent productivity. Without us, they’d just be animals, slaves to the Others, who did not deserve such responsibility. We saved them, remember that. [beat] But enough about the past. I must warn you of the great crisis to come. Although those around you deny it, soon we will be unable to manufacture new markets. The people will become immune to our economists and entertainment. When the free market dies they will turn against us. Therefore, do not delay, by now you have been shown what only the Grand Masters of our Order have seen. Now you know why Abstergo, why all of it had to be...and now you know what you must do. Stay the course. We will give them freedom. Freedom from fear, freedom from pornography, from disgusting, base animal desire. Freedom from democracy. Humanity will thank us in the end. In hoc signo vinces.

Id: [0x0004C700]
It's impossible to win. And the few people who manage to get through, like that British author, we simply print them money until they do what they're told.

The capitalists will do whatever we tell them to, we print the dollars they worship after all.

Although online gaming attracts many people away from reality, make sure these virtual worlds do not become too utopic. We don't want people to question their own lack of success in the real world, now do we?

Id: [0x0004C705]
The peasants are like the sea, raging and unpredictable. That is why we have built walls.

Id: [0x0004C706]
I do not see any walls...

Id: [0x0004C707]
No? Look around you. A shelf of soda here, a case of candy there, magazines, talk shows, pills. The walls of the 21st Century surround us.

Id: [0x0004C70C]
The capitalists think we run these companies for profit. The fools.

Id: [0x0004C70D]
Those "fools" work for you.

Optional slavery in exchange for pieces of paper. Doesn't that strike you as foolish?

I shut it down. I can shut it down, but it does not go away. It is almost time, Desmond Miles. I know how to open the Path. Soon, my true purpose will be revealed. Soon, I will not be alone.

Id: [0x0004C713]
Where have you been? [pause] I missed you.

Id: [0x0004C748]
Shoot him down!

Id: [0x0004CB29]
No!

Id: [0x0004CB2B]
Hey Desmond, I don't know if you're looking for something from 16, but last time scanning in Eagle Vision seemed to help.

Id: [0x0004CB47]
I'm seeing a class split in these images. My guess is that you have to pick out those showing the Templar lifestyle.

Id: [0x0004CB8D]
The sovereign. Maybe the king? As for the people, I'm betting on a pawn. So, the pawn in front of the king?

Id: [0x0004CBCC]
Brothers...Well, you already have one pawn on the board. And what about that word there "right"? It's extraneous...unless, could it be intentional?

Id: [0x0004CD76]
Hmmm. That red 48... It's the atomic number of cadmium, don't need to tell you that. Two complete day and night cycles maybe or... 48 red balloons? I do know that the mountain in one of the images is Mount Washington. That seems to fit the clue. So the answer to 48 is most likely below it.

Id: [0x0004CD78]
"A small piece" probably refers to a pawn.

Id: [0x0004CD7B]
Something to do with machines. Smart machines?

Id: [0x0004CD7D]
All those symbols are decoys, I just know it. So look for something familiar you can grab onto.

Id: [0x0004CD87]
Rich pickings, get him!

Id: [0x0004CD88]
Your money, and your life!

Id: [0x0004CD89]
Take him, he's got coin!

Id: [0x0004CD8A]
Now boys! He'll have a fat purse.

Id: [0x0004CD8B]
How much coin do you have corpse?

Id: [0x0004CD8C]
It's pay-day ragazzi!

Id: [0x0004CD8D]
Nice clothes, I get the boots!

Id: [0x0004CD8E]
We have caught a fat goose fratelli!

Id: [0x0004CD93]
The Vizier was a piece used in chess prior to the 10th Century. Once the game was brought to Europe, the Vizier was renamed as the Queen.

Id: [0x0004CDE2]
Since none of these photographs contain rain, I'd search for a stylized lightning bolt.

Id: [0x0004CE88]
Right, it seems that the coordinates you chose lend this code its key. So set the wheel to the first pair highlighted on the left. Then, scroll to the symbol that corresponds with the number. Repeat that for all four slots of the code.

Id: [0x0004CE8A]
Maybe the next symbol in the pattern isn't adjacent to the previous one.

Id: [0x0004CEC7]
About that missing symbol. Just a shot in the dark, but it seems to me that the symbols on the wheel reflect each other.

Id: [0x0004CED2]
Felice anno nuovo! (Happy New Year!)

Id: [0x0004CEF1]
"Blown apart" seems strange. Maybe there's some sort of reason 16 picked that phrase? And what about the ending? I don't see any spotlights in the images, but maybe something less literal?

Id: [0x0004CEF3]
Hmmm. The progression of the numbers on the code wheel seems random. I don't know...there must be a numerical key somewhere that explains the pattern.

Id: [0x0004CF30]
Oh, you need a savior, do you? Hello! Well, the bishop is too easy, you know. I bet 16's referring to a protector of some sort. [beat] In other news, what about that F?

Id: [0x0004CF4E]
It looks like something involving the elements...and possibly workers.

Id: [0x0004CF50]
16 is definitely not in the running for a marriage anytime soon, so that word "wed" stands out a bit. I don't see any weddings, but maybe there's something else up there wedding-related.

Id: [0x0004CF52]
Tricky one. Some of those symbols look like letters. They probably come from somewhere...but where exactly, that's the question.

Id: [0x0004CF54]
Echoes...they bounce back, like the numbers at the beginning of the line.

Id: [0x0004CF57]
I don't see anything involving sight on the board. Maybe I'm missing something. Shifting from 1st to 2nd, well that probably refers to moving from row 1 to 2. Ya, that's all I've got.

Id: [0x0004CF5A]
Well, since I don't know many people who are as fast as a race car, 16 must be talking about a thing right? It's probably quite a common thing too. Maybe, maybe something involving communication?

Id: [0x0004CF5C]
Whites. Ok well, either white pieces or white squares. Now considering the uselessness of the former, I assume the later. So a move to an adjacent white square?

Id: [0x0004CF5F]
What could possibly be produced without hands? Ummm, an idea?

Id: [0x0004CF61]
Is there something rising in one of the photographs?

Id: [0x0004CF63]
I'm not sure about the rest, but the Latin means "Free your mind."

Id: [0x0004CF76]
What about us? You might actually need a historian down there.

Id: [0x0004CF78]
Shaun's right. That tunnel should lead under Capitoline Hill. I'll help them find another entrance. [beat] Be careful, Desmond.

Id: [0x0004CF79]
I'll drive.

Id: [0x0004CFD3]
What was that?

Id: [0x0004CFD4]
I don't see anything.

Id: [0x0004CFD5]
Any chance you can lift that gate?

Id: [0x0004CFD6]
Not unless you want me to end up like that skeleton.

Id: [0x0004CFD8]
I can drop into the corridor below through here.

Id: [0x0004CFD9]
Watch out for bats.

Id: [0x0004CFDA]
Where?

Id: [0x0004CFDB]
I meant, in case you see any.

Id: [0x0004CFDC]
Remind me not to make you a lookout.

Id: [0x0004CFDE]
Desmond!

Id: [0x0004CFDF]
More ghosts.

Id: [0x0004CFE0]
I'm here, okay? Stay with me.

Id: [0x0004CFE2]
Up there.

Id: [0x0004CFE3]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0004CFE8]
I wonder how old these tunnels are?

Id: [0x0004CFE9]
Middle ages probably. Luckily, the beams still hold our weight.

Id: [0x0004CFEB]
That one looks like you.

Id: [0x0004CFEC]
When Ezio came here.

Id: [0x0004CFED]
Yeah, I meant Ezio.

Id: [0x0004CFEE]
I shouldn't put you through all this. It's not right.

Id: [0x0004CFEF]
Hey. All joking aside, I'm having the time of my life. And it's thanks to you.

Id: [0x0004CFF0]
Just focus on where you're going, okay?

Id: [0x0004CFF1]
When did this become my job?

Id: [0x0004CFF2]
If I pulled all the levers, then what would be left for you?

Id: [0x0004CFF3]
Nothing?

Id: [0x0004CFF4]
[Laughs] Nice try.

Id: [0x0004CFF7]
I've got this one!

Id: [0x0004CFF8]
Remember. This is the time of your life.

Id: [0x0004CFF9]
Yeah. Yeah.

Id: [0x0004CFFB]
Ready?

Id: [0x0004CFFC]
Go for it.

Id: [0x0004CFFE]
Okay. Release it!

Id: [0x0004D001]
After all this time in the Animus, I'm not so sure.

Id: [0x0004D003]
How come you don't have to get wet?

Id: [0x0004D004]
Because you're here.

Id: [0x0004D005]
Charming.

Id: [0x0004D006]
Aren't I?

Id: [0x0004D008]
Great. The bridge is out.

Id: [0x0004D009]
What bridge?

Id: [0x0004D00A]
Never mind.

Id: [0x0004D00C]
Let me see...

Id: [0x0004D00D]
Oh, you go on ahead. I'll just stay here to die in the dark with the bats.

Id: [0x0004D010]
Jump across!

Id: [0x0004D012]
You'd think these stairs would lead somewhere.

Id: [0x0004D013]
But they don't.

Id: [0x0004D014]
Oh, life is full of disappointments.

Id: [0x0004D016]
I'll wait here.

Id: [0x0004D017]
Good. Let me just go and get that bridge down for you.

Id: [0x0004D018]
I did the last one!

Id: [0x0004D019]
And I'm sure that will be YOUR last one.

Id: [0x0004D01A]
Haha. Very funny.

Id: [0x0004D01C]
Got it!

Id: [0x0004D01D]
Thank you, Desmond!

Id: [0x0004D01F]
Now it's my turn to even the score.

Id: [0x0004D021]
There!

Id: [0x0004D022]
Thanks. It's a start.

Id: [0x0004D024]
Do your magic.

Id: [0x0004D026]
Up you go!

Id: [0x0004D028]
Thanks. We make a good team.

Id: [0x0004D02A]
I can see the Sanctuary.

Id: [0x0004D02C]
Whatever this is, it doesn't do anything. It's a dead end.

Id: [0x0004D02F]
What's going on?!

Id: [0x0004D030]
We're here.

Id: [0x0004D031]
Now, for that password. If Shaun's right, that is.

Id: [0x0004D032]
I'm always right.

Id: [0x0004D033]
It's open.

Id: [0x0004D034]
After you... I think.

Id: [0x0004D037]
There's something up there.

Id: [0x0004D038]
Where to now?

Id: [0x0004D043]
About that dead end...

Id: [0x0004D044]
That never happened. I was misquoted.

Id: [0x0004D04A]
Hello. That wasn't in the blueprints.

Id: [0x0004D04B]
Desmond, get down here!

Id: [0x0004D04C]
On my way.

Id: [0x0004D04F]
You guys have to see this.

Id: [0x0004D055]
We did it.

Id: [0x0004D056]
I can't believe we're finally here.

Id: [0x0004D05A]
Lucy, I'm making my way toward the entrance.

Id: [0x0004D05B]
Okay. Good.

Id: [0x0004D05C]
If you see any gladiators, my advice would be: leg it!

Id: [0x0004D05D]
I'll keep that in mind.

Id: [0x0004D062]
I can't believe I'm actually going to hold the Apple.

Id: [0x0004D063]
It's been a long time coming. You've earned it.

Id: [0x0004D064]
I wonder if it will change things. Whether it can tip the scales in our favor.

Id: [0x0004D065]
I'm sure it will. It has to.

Id: [0x0004D067]
There's so much construction. This place is like a maze.

Id: [0x0004D073]
The hypogeum housed the cages of the gladiators and the machines which raised them to the surface. The whole area you're in right now was originally covered by the arena.

Id: [0x0004D074]
Good to know.

Id: [0x0004D078]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0004D079]
What's going on, Desmond?

Id: [0x0004D07A]
Nothing.

Id: [0x0004D07F]
What do you think we'll find?

Id: [0x0004D080]
Hopefully, a map to the Temples.

Id: [0x0004D081]
The Apple's just going to give it to us, is it, ya? Oh, is that Elvis over there.

Id: [0x0004D082]
Hey, maybe this time we'll be lucky.

Id: [0x0004D084]
Okay, I'm back on familiar ground.

Id: [0x0004D087]
We've traced your position. I think I've found an entrance.

Id: [0x0004D089]
Welcome back, Desmond.

Id: [0x0004D08A]
Don't stand up too fast.

Id: [0x0004D08B]
Get up slowly.

Id: [0x0004D08C]
Break time!

Id: [0x0004D08D]
Desmond's back.

Id: [0x0004D08F]
You're all set to go.

Id: [0x0004D090]
Ezio's waiting.

Id: [0x0004D091]
Ready when you are.

Id: [0x0004D092]
Baby's all ready for you.

Id: [0x0004D093]
Good to go.

Id: [0x0004D095]
Desmond, come back. The sun's about to rise.

Id: [0x0004D096]
Desmond, it's nearly sunrise.

Id: [0x0004D097]
Sunrise is coming. You can't risk being seen.

Id: [0x0004D098]
Desmond, come back to the Sanctuary. The sun is rising.

Id: [0x0004D099]
You have to get back here before sunrise.

Id: [0x0004D09B]
The numbers in the code wheel are changing drastically. Is it possible that each place value is being treated differently? Look at the ones column and the tens column.

Id: [0x0004D13F]
Ya, I didn't want to say anything, but you're really getting fat.

Id: [0x0004D140]
Ouch.

Id: [0x0004D141]
I even told Rebecca to widen the Animus.

Id: [0x0004D142]
Seriously?

Id: [0x0004D143]
No.

Id: [0x0004D14F]
Which one?

Id: [0x0004D150]
The tall one.

Id: [0x0004D151]
Really? Not the pile of rubble?

Id: [0x0004D152]
[Short laugh] You know, when I came here last--

Id: [0x0004D158]
The bats will be disappointed.

Now, I'm reliving the memories of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, my ancestor from the Renaissance, searching for a path forward. Through the bleeding effect, I’m becoming an Assassin in more than just name.

Id: [0x0004D167]
It will come in handy, as the Templars prepare to enslave us all.

Id: [0x0004D168]
They've found us. They've crashed our hideout and we're fleeing the scene, looking for a place to hide. Only, there isn't any and time is running short.

Id: [0x0004D34B]
Nice job.

Id: [0x0004D34C]
I aim to please.

Id: [0x0004D56D]
I can’t get a good reading.

Id: [0x0004D56E]
I’ve never seen distortion like this.

Id: [0x0004D584]
Get out of here before I regret sparing your life.

Id: [0x0004D589]
What is going on?

Id: [0x0004DBD2]
Are you ok?

Id: [0x0004DBD3]
The bastards beat me and questioned me. I am fine. I told them nothing. <br>(spits)<br>Son's of whores.

Id: [0x0004DBD4]
What did they want?

Id: [0x0004DBD5]
They were asking about something Leo discovered while studying some ancient formulas. We must return to our- his workshop at once and warn him, I fear they will slither straight to the source as a result of my silence.

Id: [0x0004DBD6]
Leonardo is a smart man, I am not worried.

Id: [0x0004DBD7]
Smart yes, but also gullible at times.

Id: [0x0004DBD8]
Very true. Follow me.

Id: [0x0004DBDA]
Leo? Leo! Where are you?

Id: [0x0004DBDC]
He's not here! Those pezzi di merda(pieces of shit) have him!

Id: [0x0004DBDD]
Your hysterics will not bring him back. Help me search this place.

Id: [0x0004DBDF]
Here.

Id: [0x0004DBE0]
What is it?! A clue?

Id: [0x0004DBE1]
Perhaps. Let me think.

Id: [0x0004DBE2]
We don't have time to think! Scopata!<br>(Fuck!)They are probably torturing him right now!

Id: [0x0004DBE3]
Shut your mouth before I shut it for you.

Id: [0x0004DBE4]
How did you discover the Pythagoras code?

Id: [0x0004DBE9]
It was the Apple...I told you.

Id: [0x0004DBEA]
Then where is it? Tell me or I'll cut off your thumbs!

Id: [0x0004DBEB]
I don't know! Please! If I knew I would tell you!

Id: [0x0004DBED]
Who dares enter my chamber?

Id: [0x0004DBEE]
Death.

Id: [0x0004DBEF]
Kill him!

Id: [0x0004DBF1]
No. All I wanted was the Apple. Please. You must understand.

Id: [0x0004DBF2]
Don't worry, I understand.

Id: [0x0004DBF4]
I was only seeking answers!

Id: [0x0004DBF5]
Answers at the cost of innocent men.

Id: [0x0004DBF6]
Please. I will pay you everything I have.

Id: [0x0004DBF9]
All I wanted was the truth. The Apple promised me this.

Id: [0x0004DBFA]
You are not capable of understanding such things.

Id: [0x0004DBFB]
I only wanted to know our purpose. My purpose. What it all leads to...

Id: [0x0004DBFD]
You are about to find out. Requiescat in pace. (rest in peace)

Id: [0x0004DC02]
Your objective is to hide and survive.

Id: [0x0004DC05]
Your objective is to assassinate assigned targets before they steal the chests.

Id: [0x0004DC0A]
Your objective is to identify, target, and assassinate other Templars. Killing an informer will give you a contract.

Id: [0x0004DC0B]
Identify, mark, and assassinate other Templars. Killing Informers automatically grants you a contract.

Your objective is to identify, mark, and assassinate other Templars. Killing Informers automatically shows you other Templars for a few seconds.

Your objective is to assassinate the VIPs. Avoid their protectors.

Your objective is to escort the VIPs to their assigned destination. Be wary of their pursuers.

A VIP has reached his destination.

Id: [0x0004DC39]
Leonardo.

Id: [0x0004DC3A]
Ezio! I must be getting lazy in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Roma.

Id: [0x0004DC3C]
What was that?

Id: [0x0004DC3D]
Hang on. Ezio seems to be remembering something else. Something from...1506. Desmond, that date has been flagged by HQ. I have a secure message for you to read.

Id: [0x0004DC42]
Hello Rebecca. Is Lucy there?

Id: [0x0004DC43]
No, she went to get coffee. I'll go get her.

Id: [0x0004DC44]
Don't. I would rather this stayed between you and Desmond. It's more secure that way. I will monitor your progress in 1506. If my sources are accurate, we have the chance to acquire information of huge importance to our mission.

Id: [0x0004DC46]
What's happening?

Id: [0x0004DC47]
Ezio seems to be remembering something. Something from....1506.

Id: [0x0004DC48]
Desmond's heart rate is increasing. I'm administering a sedative.

Id: [0x0004DC49]
No! The missing data may be there. The Piece of Eden is useless until we have it. Let him continue.

Id: [0x0004DC4A]
Yes, William.

Id: [0x0004DC4D]
Hang on. Ezio seems to be remembering something else. Something from...1506. Desmond, that date has been flagged by HQ. Let me get them on the line.

Id: [0x0004DC54]
Salai? Is that you?

Id: [0x0004DC56]
Ezio! I must be getting lazy in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Roma.

Id: [0x0004DC58]
Unfortunately, I cannot stay. I am here to charter a ship.

Id: [0x0004DC59]
A ship. I can assist you! I know a captain, he is very discreet. Hang on, I have the name written somewhere.

Id: [0x0004DC5B]
What are you working on?

Id: [0x0004DC5C]
Oh this?

Id: [0x0004DC5E]
A hobby of mine. Of course you are familiar with Pythagoras!

Id: [0x0004DC5F]
Remind me.

Id: [0x0004DC60]
The brilliant scholar from Grecia (Greece) who discovered many secrets about the heavenly spheres and our cosmos.

Id: [0x0004DC61]
These symbols come from him?

Id: [0x0004DC62]
Ever since my exploration of that strange Apple, they have been stamped on my mind. I found symbols like them in the writings of Pythagorean disciples.

Id: [0x0004DC64]
I am afraid the captain's name escapes me.

Id: [0x0004DC65]
The Apple has been put to rest. Perhaps it would do you good to focus on painting.

Id: [0x0004DC67]
Ha! You are kind, however even I can see that she is badly drawn. And that smile? Overdone. Meaningless. But forget painting, I made a breakthrough in my research several days ago. A huge discovery.

Id: [0x0004DC69]
Messere (Mister) Leonardo. Gian Giacomo refuses to return.

Id: [0x0004DC6B]
Why does Salai never listen? Ezio, my announcement will have to wait. I intended to accompany you to the docks, but I cannot leave my workshop without my assistant.

Id: [0x0004DC6C]
Bene. An easy task.

Id: [0x0004DC6D]
I am afraid you underestimate Salai!

Id: [0x0004DC6E]
Wait and see. I will return shortly.

Id: [0x0004DC75]
Di nuovo! (Again!)

Id: [0x0004DC76]
I should have never leant you those dice.

Id: [0x0004DC77]
Gian Giacomo?

Id: [0x0004DC78]
I do not answer to that name.

Id: [0x0004DC79]
Basta! (Enough!)

Id: [0x0004DC7A]
Fortuna wishes she were as good as me.

Id: [0x0004DC7B]
Salai.

Id: [0x0004DC7C]
Better. But not good enough.

Id: [0x0004DC7E]
Yes! Di nuovo! (Again!)

Id: [0x0004DC7F]
Leonardo, your master, requests your presence.

Id: [0x0004DC80]
Let him wait.

Id: [0x0004DC81]
No.

Id: [0x0004DC83]
Nice hood. Are you one of Julius's monks?

Id: [0x0004DC84]
My church is not of God.

Id: [0x0004DC85]
Outside the realm of God is the realm of men. You worship there, Signore (Sir)?

Id: [0x0004DC86]
Come with me and find out.

Id: [0x0004DC88]
It has been fun, but I must go.

Id: [0x0004DC89]
Please, do not depart. The game is not finished.

Id: [0x0004DC8A]
Sorry, but a better opportunity has arisen. (to Ezio) Lead me out then.

Id: [0x0004DC90]
Cazzo. (Fuck.)

Id: [0x0004DC94]
Three men follow us. Stay quiet--

Id: [0x0004DC97]
Ascoltate! (Listen!) I am done playing.

Id: [0x0004DC98]
So are we!

Id: [0x0004DC9D]
There is only one man in Roma who can put on a show like that. You must be Ezio Auditore.

Id: [0x0004DC9E]
Come. We need to return to Leonardo right away.

Id: [0x0004DC9F]
You do not talk much, do you? Fine. I will run ahead. You catch up.

Id: [0x0004DCA4]
These strangers just do not quit.

Id: [0x0004DCA5]
I was afraid of this. Disciples wearing similar robes have appeared before. They wanted an...object I found.

Id: [0x0004DCA6]
You mean, the Piece of Eden?

Id: [0x0004DCA7]
Leonardo told you?

Id: [0x0004DCA8]
He tells me everything. Even things about you.

Id: [0x0004DCA9]
His indiscretion has cost us dearly this time. We must warn him.

Id: [0x0004DCAA]
Say no more. I know the best route home. Follow me.

Id: [0x0004DCAB]
Help!

Id: [0x0004DCAD]
Did he tell you of his "big discovery"?

Id: [0x0004DCAE]
No.

Id: [0x0004DCAF]
Leonardo has been exploring some kind of catacomb for years now. I think he came to Roma to find it. You have no idea what he is like. He never takes me out. He spends all his time tinkering in his workshop. And he is so cheap! I have to beg him for money.

Id: [0x0004DCB0]
He actually gives it to you?

Id: [0x0004DCB1]
More or less. What he does not know will not hurt him. Allora (So), you are from Firenze? Tell me more.

Id: [0x0004DCB2]
Leonardo discovered something in the catacombs?

Id: [0x0004DCB3]
How very mysterious you are, Ezio Auditore. I like it. [beat] He found the entrance to a temple, something he read about in his books. I have not seen him that excited in years.

Id: [0x0004DCB5]
We should go around.

Id: [0x0004DCB6]
Pythagoras.

Id: [0x0004DCB7]
Why would I spend my time at the workshop when I can go out and have fun? Ask Leonardo when we get there.

Id: [0x0004DCB8]
Did he say anything else?

Id: [0x0004DCB9]
That the temple contains the perfect number, something discovered by some scholar from Grecia.

Id: [0x0004DCBA]
Why not travel by horse?

Id: [0x0004DCBE]
Leonardo?

Id: [0x0004DCBF]
They took him.

Id: [0x0004DCC0]
No. He has to be here.

Id: [0x0004DCC1]
The temple. Where is it?

Id: [0x0004DCC3]
Leonardo!

Id: [0x0004DCC5]
Come back. Please.

Id: [0x0004DCC6]
If you want to save him, tell me where the temple is.

Id: [0x0004DCC7]
I do not know.

Id: [0x0004DCC8]
Hold on. Something is written on the floor.

Id: [0x0004DCC9]
What?

Id: [0x0004DCCA]
I cannot read. Leonardo promised to teach me. But now...

Id: [0x0004DCCC]
"Villa. Paintings." He wants us to examine art?

Id: [0x0004DCCD]
While Leonardo was at your uncle's villa, he researched the location of the catacombs.

Id: [0x0004DCCE]
What does a notebook have to do with paintings?

Id: [0x0004DCCF]
Maybe the pages are hidden in one of the frames?

Id: [0x0004DCD1]
Did you notice anyone strange hanging around after the discovery?

Id: [0x0004DCD3]
How about some fun on the rooftops?

Id: [0x0004DCD4]
Impossible. They all burned in the attack.

Id: [0x0004DCD5]
No they did not. Only Leda and St. John, the Borgia took the rest.

Id: [0x0004DCD6]
Six paintings?

Id: [0x0004DCD7]
Five. I counterfeited Portrait of a Lady. I needed the money for a doublet. [beat, sadly] Now, of course, it has gone out of fashion.

Id: [0x0004DCD8]
Who has the paintings now?

Id: [0x0004DCD9]
Lucrezia Borgia, in her husband's palazzo outside Ferrara.

Id: [0x0004DCDA]
Then it is time I took back what was stolen from me so many years ago.

Id: [0x0004DCDB]
Hang on, old friend. I am coming.

Id: [0x0004DCE2]
Did you have an enjoyable ride, Duchessa (Duchess)?

Id: [0x0004DCE3]
Oh yes, apart from the fact that I spent most of it looking over my shoulder for a knife.

Id: [0x0004DCE4]
I do not understand, Duchessa (Duchess)? Who is trying to attack you?

Id: [0x0004DCE5]
My father kept them at bay. Kept me safe. Now they are all after me. They want my head.

Id: [0x0004DCE6]
But, Signora--

Id: [0x0004DCE7]
I thought the countryside was supposed to be safer, instead this place only makes me more of a target. Increase the patrols and warn me of any intruders. No one is allowed in the palazzo but my husband's private guard.

Id: [0x0004DCE9]
You heard the Duchessa (Duchess)! Sound the alarm if any intruder is spotted. [quietly] Poor Alfonso, his wife has gone mad.

Id: [0x0004DCEC]
What is the meaning of this? I am supposed to shine the Duchessa's (Duchess's) shoes.

Id: [0x0004DCED]
No one is allowed in the palazzo.

Id: [0x0004DCEE]
Is she going to shine her own shoes then?

Id: [0x0004DCEF]
What the Duchessa (Duchess) does or does not do is of no concern to you.

Id: [0x0004DCF0]
What a life this is, let me tell you.

Id: [0x0004DCF1]
I would rather you did not tell me.

Id: [0x0004DCF2]
I will complain to the Duca (Duke).

Id: [0x0004DCF3]
As long as you are stuck on that side no one will hear you.

Id: [0x0004DCF4]
I have had enough.

Id: [0x0004DCF5]
Stay where you are.

Id: [0x0004DCF6]
Let me through!

Id: [0x0004DCF7]
You must wait until the Duchessa (Duchess) allows you to pass.

Id: [0x0004DCF9]
I heard the Duca (Duke) has borrowed guards from the Pope himself to watch over the palazzo.

Id: [0x0004DCFB]
Julius has leant Alfonso several of his guards in return for siding with the Pope against Ravenna.

Id: [0x0004DCFC]
We shall see how long that alliance lasts.

Id: [0x0004DCFE]
Come to kill me at last, Assassino?

Id: [0x0004DCFF]
Buongiorno (Good day), Lucrezia. Or should I say, Duchessa (Duchess).

Id: [0x0004DD00]
A borrowed title, ill-fitting and barely concealing the truth.

Id: [0x0004DD04]
Your clothing does not concern me, I am here for what you have hung on your walls.

Id: [0x0004DD05]
Redecorating, are we?

Id: [0x0004DD06]
You have stolen five Leonardo Da Vinci paintings and I want them returned.

Id: [0x0004DD07]
Ha! We all want to turn back time, to get back what we have lost. You have taken my birthplace, my city from me. I am duchessa (duchess) to a people who I can never know. You see before you a stranger, a castaway. An orphan. [beat] Your paintings are gone, Assassino.

Id: [0x0004DD08]
I do not believe you.

Id: [0x0004DD09]
Painful, is it not?

Id: [0x0004DD0B]
Perhaps we can comfort each other.

Id: [0x0004DD0C]
A generous offer.

Id: [0x0004DD0E]
What of the paintings? Where are they?

Id: [0x0004DD0F]
Sold to Francesco Colonna...and one to someone who was special to me, Patrizio. He spends his time near Il Vaticano. I kept one for myself.

Id: [0x0004DD11]
Give it to me.

Id: [0x0004DD12]
Oh I will. [yelled] Guards! Deliver Da Vinci's Annunciation to a cart outside the city gates.

Id: [0x0004DD13]
Molto Bene. (Very good.) Now, close your eyes.

Id: [0x0004DD15]
My husband is about to arrive with his guards, so it is best if you hurry.

Id: [0x0004DD16]
It is already done, Duchessa (Duchess).

Id: [0x0004DD17]
What?

Id: [0x0004DD19]
Say hello to the Duca (Duke) for me.

Id: [0x0004DD1A]
Guards! Guards!

Id: [0x0004DD1E]
That putanna (whore) sent it to me as a present. I want it out of my house.

Id: [0x0004DD1F]
We will be glad to add it to our collection. As agreed, the Master waits at your palazzo to take it off your hands.

Id: [0x0004DD20]
She thought I would be pleased with such a gift? After she married another man?

Id: [0x0004DD23]
The ways of men and women are strange to each other, but through careful study both may be brought into harmony.

Id: [0x0004DD24]
Doubtlessly, one such as Lucrezia has never crossed your path.

Id: [0x0004DD2A]
So you have decided to sell.

Id: [0x0004DD2B]
Of course. That woman was a terror. It is her Spanish blood, I know it.

Id: [0x0004DD2C]
These categories applied to human beings. These hierarchies. I find them lazy and a waste.

Id: [0x0004DD2D]
You should tell her that, the high and mighty Duchessa (Duchess). I have changed my mind. That painting does not deserve to belong to anyone. I intend to destroy it.

Id: [0x0004DD2F]
[groan]

Id: [0x0004DD30]
Human hands made that, therefore it is divine. Soon your brothers will understand. [to the Hermeticist] Take the painting and examine it for clues. Go.

Id: [0x0004DD37]
Buongiorno (Good day). This is the home of Francesco Colonna?

Id: [0x0004DD38]
It was, but now the banks own everything. We have lost it all.

Id: [0x0004DD39]
Even the Da Vinci paintings?

Id: [0x0004DD3A]
A lesser part of Signore's (Sir's) collection.

Id: [0x0004DD3B]
I have an interest in them nonetheless.

Id: [0x0004DD3C]
The three paintings were put up for auction and purchased by a merchant of Firenze. He prepares to set sail from the harbor.

Id: [0x0004DD3D]
Grazie mille. (Thank you very much.)

Id: [0x0004DD45]
Ezio Auditore. [to the girl] Come back down to the harbor when I return to Roma.

Id: [0x0004DD47]
Living in this second-rate city, instead of beautiful Firenze? How low you have sunk.

Id: [0x0004DD48]
Duccio. I am warning you--

Id: [0x0004DD49]
I see your sister has taken to it too. She did not want to open her legs in Firenze, but now she is the Madame of Roma.

Id: [0x0004DD4D]
You can hit me, but that does not mean Firenze will take you back!

Id: [0x0004DD4E]
Dirty Roman!

Id: [0x0004DD4F]
Your father pretended to by from Firenze, but we all knew you were outsiders.

Id: [0x0004DD51]
Hit him!

Id: [0x0004DD52]
Get him!

Id: [0x0004DD54]
You are going to shut your mouth, and give me what I want. The three Da Vinci paintings.

Id: [0x0004DD55]
One is on the boat. The other two were sold to a cardinal, he is displaying them for high ranking members of the Church.

Id: [0x0004DD56]
How do I get in?

Id: [0x0004DD57]
How should I know? Go ask your whore of a sister, she has probably slept with a couple of them.

Id: [0x0004DD5C]
You are back in Roma!

Id: [0x0004DD5D]
With just enough time to visit you.

Id: [0x0004DD5E]
Ezio. Do not lie to me. I can tell that you have come for a reason.

Id: [0x0004DD5F]
You know me too well. I need to get inside an exclusive viewing of paintings led by a cardinal.

Id: [0x0004DD60]
The event you seek is at the Castel Sant'Angelo later today. You will need an invitation. Fortunately, I know where you can procure one. It will give you access to the lower floors. Only known cardinals are allowed higher.

Id: [0x0004DD61]
I knew I could count on you.

Id: [0x0004DD66]
The invitation is not here.

Id: [0x0004DD67]
I will deliver it to Signore!

Id: [0x0004DD6B]
Got it!

Id: [0x0004DD6F]
Come with me. Once we get inside, I will mark the paintings for you to steal. Bring them to Salai at Leonardo's workshop. Capisco? (Understand)?

Id: [0x0004DD72]
Invitation?

Id: [0x0004DD73]
Here.

Id: [0x0004DD75]
Oh my.

Id: [0x0004DD77]
Come again soon...I hope.

Id: [0x0004DD7A]
How daring! I have not seen an annunciation from this angle before.

Id: [0x0004DD7B]
The composition suffers I feel. The light of God is not properly expressed. It does not move me.

Id: [0x0004DD7C]
You are stuck in your ways, my friend.

Id: [0x0004DD7F]
The upper floors are now open to the cardinals who wish to see additional expressions of devotion.

Id: [0x0004DD82]
Come upstairs with me, my dear.

Id: [0x0004DD85]
Two of the paintings are missing! Be on the lookout for a thief!

Id: [0x0004DD8A]
Nothing is there, no pages, nothing.

Id: [0x0004DD8B]
Think.

Id: [0x0004DD8C]
It is all over. These paintings are a blank slate.

Id: [0x0004DD8D]
Salai, Leonardo likes to hide his studies, correct?

Id: [0x0004DD8E]
Yes. He told me he writes backwards sometimes...Ezio, he also experiments with inks, including an ink that vanishes!

Id: [0x0004DD8F]
Look at the paintings again.

Id: [0x0004DD92]
I can see them. Let me draw them on pieces of paper.

Id: [0x0004DD95]
Bene. These should join together.

Id: [0x0004DD97]
You got it! Go, bring him back...I mean, it has been really boring without him.

Id: [0x0004DD99]
Tell me where the entrance is.

Id: [0x0004DD9A]
Trust is a terrible thing.

Id: [0x0004DD9B]
You are betraying mine!

Id: [0x0004DD9D]
[groan]

Id: [0x0004DD9E]
No.

Id: [0x0004DD9F]
Leonardo, I still cannot comprehend why you have turned against the ideals we always held dear!

Id: [0x0004DE37]
Ezio! I must be getting lazy in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Roma.

Id: [0x0004DE38]
What was that?

Id: [0x0004DE3A]
What's happening?

Id: [0x0004DE3C]
Ezio seems to be remembering something. Something from....1506.

Id: [0x0004DE3E]
Desmond's heart rate is increasing. I'm administering a sedative.

Id: [0x0004DE3F]
No! The missing data may be there. The Piece of Eden is useless until we have it. Let him continue.

Id: [0x0004DE40]
Yes, William.

Id: [0x0004DE41]
Salai? Is that you?

Id: [0x0004DE42]
Ezio! I must be getting lazy in my old age. I did not know you had returned to Roma.

Id: [0x0004DE43]
Unfortunately, I cannot stay. I am here to charter a ship.

Id: [0x0004DE44]
Let me assist you! I know a captain, he is very discreet. Hang on, I have the name recorded somewhere.

Id: [0x0004DE45]
What are you working on?

Id: [0x0004DE46]
Oh this?

Id: [0x0004DE47]
A hobby of mine. Of course you are familiar with Pythagoras!

Id: [0x0004DE48]
Remind me.

Id: [0x0004DE49]
The brilliant scholar from Grecia (Greece) who discovered many secrets about the heavenly spheres and our cosmos.

Id: [0x0004DE4A]
These symbols come from him?

Id: [0x0004DE4B]
Ever since my exploration of that strange Apple, they have been stamped on my mind. I found symbols like them in the writings of the Pythagorean disciples.

Id: [0x0004DE4C]
I am afraid the captain's name escapes me.

Id: [0x0004DE4D]
The Apple has been put to rest. Perhaps it would do you good to focus on painting. You seem to be doing decent work on this one.

Id: [0x0004DE4E]
Ha! You are kind, however even I can see that she is badly drawn. And that smile? Overdone. Meaningless. But forget painting, I made a breakthrough in my research several days ago. A huge discovery. [louder] Salai! Can you bring the--

Id: [0x0004DE4F]
Oh, he is not back! I intended to accompany you to the docks, but we cannot leave my workshop without my assistant.

Id: [0x0004DE50]
Bene. (Good.) An easy task.

Id: [0x0004DE51]
I am afraid you underestimate Salai!

Id: [0x0004DE52]
Hehe. Wait and see.

Id: [0x0004DE53]
Suit yourself. You will likely find him at La Volpe Addormentata (The Sleeping Fox).

Id: [0x0004DE54]
Di nuovo! (Again!)

Id: [0x0004DE55]
I told you those dice were lucky.

Id: [0x0004DE56]
Fortuna wishes she were as good as me.

Id: [0x0004DE57]
Gian Giacomo?

Id: [0x0004DE58]
I do not answer to that name.

Id: [0x0004DE59]
Salai.

Id: [0x0004DE5A]
Better. But not good enough.

Id: [0x0004DE5B]
Yes! Di nuovo! (Again!)

Id: [0x0004DE5C]
Leonardo, your master, requests your presence.

Id: [0x0004DE5D]
Let him wait.

Id: [0x0004DE5E]
No.

Id: [0x0004DE5F]
Nice hood. Are you one of Julius's monks?

Id: [0x0004DE60]
My church is not of God.

Id: [0x0004DE61]
Outside the kingdom of God is the realm of men. You worship there, Messere (Sir)?

Id: [0x0004DE62]
Come with me and find out.

Id: [0x0004DE63]
It has been fun, but I must go.

Id: [0x0004DE64]
Please, do not depart. The game is not finished.

Id: [0x0004DE65]
Sorry, but a better offer has arisen. (to Ezio) Lead on, Messere (Sir).

Id: [0x0004DE66]
The three men from the dice game follow us. Stay quiet--

Id: [0x0004DE67]
Why?

Id: [0x0004DE68]
Sentite! (Listen!) I am done playing.

Id: [0x0004DE69]
So are we!

Id: [0x0004DE6A]
There is only one man in Roma who can put on a show like that. You must be Ezio Auditore.

Id: [0x0004DE6B]
Come. We need to return to Leonardo right away.

Id: [0x0004DE6C]
You do not talk much, do you? Fine. I will run ahead. You catch up.

Id: [0x0004DE6D]
These strangers do not quit.

Id: [0x0004DE6E]
Disciples wearing similar robes appeared once before. They sought an...object I had in my possession.

Id: [0x0004DE6F]
You mean, the Piece of Eden?

Id: [0x0004DE70]
Leonardo told you?

Id: [0x0004DE71]
He tells me everything.

Id: [0x0004DE72]
I fear his indiscretion has cost us greatly. We must warn him.

Id: [0x0004DE73]
Say no more. I know the best route home. I take it every morning after the taverns close. Follow me.

Id: [0x0004DE74]
Leonardo told me that he had discovered something important.

Id: [0x0004DE75]
He has been exploring a hidden catacomb for years now. I think he came to Roma to find it.

Id: [0x0004DE76]
You have no idea what he is like. He works on this all the time, he never takes me out. And he is so cheap! I have to beg him for money.

Id: [0x0004DE77]
He actually gives coins to you?

Id: [0x0004DE78]
More or less. What he does not know will not hurt him. Allora (So), you are from Firenze? Tell me more.

Id: [0x0004DE79]
Fine, I will use my imagination.

Id: [0x0004DE7A]
Leonardo discovered something in the catacombs?

Id: [0x0004DE7B]
He found the entrance to a temple, something he read about in his books. I have not seen him that excited in years.

Id: [0x0004DE7C]
Did he say anything else?

Id: [0x0004DE7D]
That the temple contains the perfect number, something discovered by some scholar from Grecia.

Id: [0x0004DE7E]
Pythagoras.

Id: [0x0004DE7F]
Knowing Leonardo, I suppose he spoke of his discovery to whomever would listen. Did you notice any robed men around him?

Id: [0x0004DE80]
Why would I spend my time at the workshop when I can go out and have fun? Ask the master himself when we get there.

Id: [0x0004DE81]
I am going around.

Id: [0x0004DE82]
It is too early in the day for fighting. Follow me.

Id: [0x0004DE83]
You want to get back quickly? Avoid their swords.

Id: [0x0004DE84]
How about some fun on the rooftops?

Id: [0x0004DE85]
Help!

Id: [0x0004DE86]
Why not travel by horse? We will get there far quicker.

Id: [0x0004DE87]
Try this on for size!

Id: [0x0004DE88]
Attack!

Id: [0x0004DE89]
Get them!

Id: [0x0004DE8A]
Taste my blade!

Id: [0x0004DE8B]
Maestro!

Id: [0x0004DE8C]
They took him.

Id: [0x0004DE8D]
No. He must be here.

Id: [0x0004DE8E]
The temple he discovered. Where is it?

Id: [0x0004DE8F]
Leonardo!

Id: [0x0004DE90]
Salai. If you want to save him tell me where the temple is.

Id: [0x0004DE91]
I do not know.

Id: [0x0004DE92]
Cazzo. (Fuck.)

Id: [0x0004DE93]
Ezio...Something is written on the floor.

Id: [0x0004DE94]
What does it say?

Id: [0x0004DE95]
I cannot read. Leonardo promised to teach me. But now...

Id: [0x0004DE96]
"Villa. Paintings." He wants us to examine art?

Id: [0x0004DE97]
I remember when Leonardo lived at your villa, he was researching the location of the catacombs.

Id: [0x0004DE98]
Several of his paintings hung in the gallery there. What do they have to do with the temple?

Id: [0x0004DE99]
Perhaps the pages of his research are hidden in one of the frames?

Id: [0x0004DE9A]
The paintings are gone. They all burned in the attack.

Id: [0x0004DE9B]
No, they did not. Only Leda and St. John, the Borgia took the rest.

Id: [0x0004DE9C]
Six paintings.

Id: [0x0004DE9D]
Five. I told the art merchant that Portrait of a Lady was by Leonardo. I needed the money for a doublet. [beat, sadly] Of course, now it has gone out of fashion.

Id: [0x0004DE9E]
Who has the paintings now?

Id: [0x0004DE9F]
Lucrezia Borgia, in her husband's palazzo outside Ferrara.

Id: [0x0004DEA0]
Then it is time I took back what was stolen.

Id: [0x0004DEA1]
Did you have an enjoyable ride, Duchessa (Duchess)?

Id: [0x0004DEA2]
Hardly. I raced across the grounds at breakneck speed for fear of a knife in my back.

Id: [0x0004DEA3]
I do not understand, Duchessa (Duchess)? Who is trying to kill you?

Id: [0x0004DEA4]
My father kept them at bay. Kept me safe. Now they chase after me. They want my head.

Id: [0x0004DEA5]
But, Signora--

Id: [0x0004DEA6]
The countryside was supposed to be serene. Death follows me, even here. [beat] Increase the patrols and warn me of any intruders. No one is allowed in the palazzo but my husband's private guard.

Id: [0x0004DEA7]
You heard the Duchessa (Duchess)! Sound the alarm if an intruder is spotted.

Id: [0x0004DEA8]
Poor Alfonso, his wife has gone mad.

Id: [0x0004DEA9]
What is the meaning of this? I am supposed to shine the Duchessa's (Duchess's) shoes.

Id: [0x0004DEAA]
No one is allowed in the palazzo.

Id: [0x0004DEAB]
Is she going to shine her own shoes then?

Id: [0x0004DEAC]
What the Duchessa (Duchess) does or does not do is of no concern to us.

Id: [0x0004DEAD]
What a life this is, let me tell you.

Id: [0x0004DEAE]
I would rather you did not.

Id: [0x0004DEAF]
I will complain to the Duca (Duke)!

Id: [0x0004DEB0]
As long as you are stuck on that side no one will hear you.

Id: [0x0004DEB1]
I have had enough.

Id: [0x0004DEB2]
Stay where you are.

Id: [0x0004DEB3]
Let me through!

Id: [0x0004DEB4]
You must wait until the Duchessa (Duchess) allows you to pass.

Id: [0x0004DEB5]
I heard the Duca (Duke) has borrowed guards from the Pope himself to watch over his palazzo.

Id: [0x0004DEB6]
Julius has leant Alfonso several of his guards in return for siding with the Pope against Ravenna.

Id: [0x0004DEB7]
We shall see how long that alliance lasts.

Id: [0x0004DEB8]
Come to kill me at last, Assassino (Assassin)?

Id: [0x0004DEB9]
Buongiorno (Good day), Lucrezia. Or should I say, Duchessa (Duchess).

Id: [0x0004DEBA]
A borrowed title bestowed by my husband, ill-fitting and barely concealing the truth.

Id: [0x0004DEBB]
You can keep your life. I am here for the art on your walls.

Id: [0x0004DEBC]
Redecorating, are we?

Id: [0x0004DEBD]
I count five Leonardo Da Vinci paintings you have stolen, and I want them returned.

Id: [0x0004DEBE]
[Laugh] If only it were that easy. My birthplace, my family, have been taken from me. You think Ferrara loves me? I am a stranger, a castaway. An orphan. [beat] Your paintings are gone, Assassino (Assassin).

Id: [0x0004DEBF]
I do not believe you.

Id: [0x0004DEC0]
Frightening, is it not? To have lost so much.

Id: [0x0004DEC1]
Perhaps we can comfort each other.

Id: [0x0004DEC2]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x0004DEC3]
Where are the paintings?

Id: [0x0004DEC4]
Sold to Francesco Colonna...and one to someone who was special to me, Patrizio. He spends his time near Il Vaticano. I kept one for myself.

Id: [0x0004DEC5]
Give it to me.

Id: [0x0004DEC6]
Guards!

Id: [0x0004DEC7]
Place Da Vinci's Annunciation in a cart. Leave it outside the walls.

Id: [0x0004DEC8]
Molto bene. (Very good.) Now, close your eyes.

Id: [0x0004DEC9]
My husband will soon arrive with his guards, so it is best if you hurry.

Id: [0x0004DECA]
Forgive me, Duchessa (Duchess).

Id: [0x0004DECB]
What for?

Id: [0x0004DECC]
No man can heal your pain. You must do so on your own.

Id: [0x0004DECD]
Say hello to the Duca (Duke) for me.

Id: [0x0004DECE]
Guards! Guards!

Id: [0x0004DECF]
You are here for the painting?

Id: [0x0004DED0]
Yes, Patrizio.

Id: [0x0004DED1]
That puttana (whore) sent it to me as a present. I want it out of my house.

Id: [0x0004DED2]
We will be glad to add it to our collection. As agreed, the Master waits at your palazzo to take it off your hands.

Id: [0x0004DED3]
She thought I would be pleased with such a gift? After she married another man?

Id: [0x0004DED4]
The ways of men and women are strange, but Hermes teaches us that through careful study both may be brought into harmony.

Id: [0x0004DED5]
Doubtless, one such as Lucrezia has never crossed your path.

Id: [0x0004DED6]
What is it? What’s going on?

Id: [0x0004DED7]
Damned peasants!

Id: [0x0004DED8]
Come with me.

Id: [0x0004DED9]
You will complete the sale?

Id: [0x0004DEDA]
Of course. That woman used false passion to seduce me. The error lies in her Spanish blood, I know it.

Id: [0x0004DEDB]
Such untruths you so casually utter, based on little more than a name. These countries, these groups, make such easy targets for the lazy and ignorant.

Id: [0x0004DEDC]
You should tell her that, the high and mighty Duchessa (Duchess). Puttana! (Whore!) I have changed my mind. That painting does not deserve to belong to anyone.

Id: [0x0004DEDD]
[groan]

Id: [0x0004DEDE]
Take the painting and examine it for clues. Be careful. Human hands aided by a fierce intelligence made that. Treat it with respect. Go!

Id: [0x0004DEDF]
Buongiorno (Good day). Is this the home of Francesco Colonna?

Id: [0x0004DEE0]
It was, but now the banks own everything. We have lost it all.

Id: [0x0004DEE1]
Even the Da Vinci paintings?

Id: [0x0004DEE2]
A lesser part of Signore's (Sir's) collection.

Id: [0x0004DEE3]
I have an interest in them nonetheless.

Id: [0x0004DEE4]
The three paintings were put up for auction and purchased by a merchant of Firenze. He prepares to set sail from the harbor immediately.

Id: [0x0004DEE5]
Grazie mille. (Thank you very much.)

Id: [0x0004DEE6]
Ezio Auditore. [to the girl] Come back down to the harbor when I return to Roma. I will show you the inside of my ship.

Id: [0x0004DEE7]
Living in this third-rate city, instead of beautiful Firenze? How low you have sunk.

Id: [0x0004DEE8]
Duccio. We are not children anymore.

Id: [0x0004DEE9]
Look around. I have help this time. And you are all alone.

Id: [0x0004DEEA]
I am warning you...

Id: [0x0004DEEB]
We are only talking, are we not? I see this place has worked its magic on your sister. She did not want to open her legs in Firenze, but now she is the Madame of Roma.

Id: [0x0004DEEC]
Cazzo! (Fuck!) Why are you just standing there?

Id: [0x0004DEED]
Hit him!

Id: [0x0004DEEE]
You can hit me, but that does not mean that Firenze will take you back!

Id: [0x0004DEEF]
Dirty Roman!

Id: [0x0004DEF0]
Your father pretended to be one of us, but we all knew you were outsiders.

Id: [0x0004DEF1]
Get him!

Id: [0x0004DEF2]
What is this? Who the hell are these guys?

Id: [0x0004DEF3]
You are going to shut your mouth, and give me what I want. The three Da Vinci paintings.

Id: [0x0004DEF4]
One is on the boat. The other two were sold to a cardinal, he is displaying them for high ranking members of the Church.

Id: [0x0004DEF5]
How do I get in?

Id: [0x0004DEF6]
How should I know? Go ask your whore of a sister, I am sure she has slept with a couple of cardinals.

Id: [0x0004DEF7]
Where is Marco? He was to come here after examining another Da Vinci painting near Il Vaticano.

Id: [0x0004DEF8]
Imagine. Once we open the temple, the true Renaissance will be upon us and the teachings of Hermes will be known to all men.

Id: [0x0004DEF9]
Patience, brothers. Soon we will reveal the secrets of this painting.

Id: [0x0004DEFA]
Buongiorno (Good day). Have you ladies heard of an art viewing somewhere in the city?

Id: [0x0004DEFB]
You have returned to Roma!

Id: [0x0004DEFC]
With just enough time to visit you.

Id: [0x0004DEFD]
Ezio. Do not lie to me.

Id: [0x0004DEFE]
I need to get inside a private showing of Da Vinci paintings.

Id: [0x0004DEFF]
There is a viewing at the Castel Sant'Angelo later today. You will need an invitation. Fortunately, I know where you can procure one. It will give you access to the lower floors. Only cardinals are allowed higher.

Id: [0x0004DF00]
I knew I could count on you.

Id: [0x0004DF01]
Si, si. (Yes, yes.) Some of my girls will accompany you. Buona fortuna (Good luck) and don't get caught.

Id: [0x0004DF02]
The invitation is not here.

Id: [0x0004DF03]
I will deliver it to Signore (Sir)!

Id: [0x0004DF04]
Got it!

Id: [0x0004DF05]
Come with me. Once we get inside, I will mark the paintings for you to steal. Bring them to Leonardo's workshop. Capito? (Understand?)

Id: [0x0004DF06]
Invitation?

Id: [0x0004DF07]
Here.

Id: [0x0004DF08]
Oh my.

Id: [0x0004DF09]
Come back soon...I hope.

Id: [0x0004DF0A]
How daring! I have not seen an annunciation from this angle before.

Id: [0x0004DF0B]
The composition suffers I feel. The light of God is not properly expressed. It does not move me.

Id: [0x0004DF0C]
You are truly stuck in your ways, my friend.

Id: [0x0004DF0D]
Ehi, voi! Non toccate i dipinti. (Hey, you! Do not touch the paintings.)

Id: [0x0004DF0E]
The upper floors are now open to the cardinals who wish to see additional expressions of devotion.

Id: [0x0004DF0F]
Two of the paintings are missing! Be on the lookout for a thief!

Id: [0x0004DF10]
Have you found anything?

Id: [0x0004DF11]
Nothing is there, no pages, nothing.

Id: [0x0004DF12]
That cannot be. Something must be special about them. Think.

Id: [0x0004DF13]
I am done thinking. These paintings are a blank slate.

Id: [0x0004DF14]
Salai. Doesn't Leonardo conceal his research?

Id: [0x0004DF15]
He frequently writes backwards...Ezio, he also experimented with inks, including an ink that vanishes!

Id: [0x0004DF16]
But we can't see invisible ink...can we?

Id: [0x0004DF17]
Ezio, use your gift!

Id: [0x0004DF18]
You know about that too?

Id: [0x0004DF19]
Search the rest!

Id: [0x0004DF1A]
I found two drawings.

Id: [0x0004DF1B]
Everything found!

Id: [0x0004DF1C]
This one has been searched entirely.

Id: [0x0004DF1D]
You have finished with that one I see.

Id: [0x0004DF1E]
There were two in this one as well.

Id: [0x0004DF1F]
One drawing here.

Id: [0x0004DF20]
There are drawings on the painting!

Id: [0x0004DF21]
We were right!

Id: [0x0004DF22]
I found one!

Id: [0x0004DF23]
Got one!

Id: [0x0004DF24]
There is one here.

Id: [0x0004DF25]
I see a drawing.

Id: [0x0004DF26]
He hid one here.

Id: [0x0004DF27]
Found another!

Id: [0x0004DF28]
Are there more drawings on that one?

Id: [0x0004DF29]
I will check it again.

Id: [0x0004DF2A]
You sure you found everything?

Id: [0x0004DF2B]
Let me concentrate.

Id: [0x0004DF2C]
That painting might have more, no?

Id: [0x0004DF2D]
I will return to this one later.

Id: [0x0004DF2E]
Did you find them all?

Id: [0x0004DF2F]
No, not yet.

Id: [0x0004DF30]
Hmm, I am missing some, I know it!

Id: [0x0004DF31]
Don't look at me, I cannot see them.

Id: [0x0004DF32]
I am going to solve this.

Id: [0x0004DF33]
I hope so. I cannot take much more.

Id: [0x0004DF34]
Do you think they would hurt him? Leonardo is terrified of violence.

Id: [0x0004DF35]
Unfortunately, this world is a violent place.

Id: [0x0004DF36]
I have found all the images, they seem to fit together.

Id: [0x0004DF37]
Draw them already!

Id: [0x0004DF38]
Bring me paper and ink.

Id: [0x0004DF39]
Is that a map? Show me the entrance.

Id: [0x0004DF3A]
I must first position its pieces.

Id: [0x0004DF3B]
Wait! What about the burned paintings?

Id: [0x0004DF3C]
It is likely the missing parts will not be needed.

Id: [0x0004DF3D]
Care to bet on that?

Id: [0x0004DF3E]
No.

Id: [0x0004DF3F]
Here. The entrance to the catacombs.

Id: [0x0004DF40]
Go. Bring him back to me.

Id: [0x0004DF41]
Hang on, old friend. I am coming.

Id: [0x0004DF42]
Tell me where the entrance is.

Id: [0x0004DF43]
For the hundredth time I will not!

Id: [0x0004DF44]
Leonardo, I still cannot comprehend why you have turned against the ideals we always held dear!

Id: [0x0004DF45]
Trust is a terrible thing.

Id: [0x0004DF46]
You are betraying mine!

Id: [0x0004DF47]
[groan from being kicked]

Id: [0x0004DF48]
[groan from being kicked]

Id: [0x0004DF49]
[groan from being kicked]

Id: [0x0004DF4A]
[groan from being kicked]

Id: [0x0004DF4B]
[groan] How naive of me...To have thought you sought knowledge as I did.

Id: [0x0004DF4C]
Why seek knowledge without putting it to use? We have the chance to fashion a better world, one in which we have the freedom to shape our own destiny.

Id: [0x0004DF4D]
And what if I choose not to be a part of your vision?

Id: [0x0004DF4E]
That is foolish. Do you not see? We can banish ignorance. Free people from their social classes and kingdoms, from their animal emotions. Everyone will have the truth at their grasp.

Id: [0x0004DF4F]
Beating me down here in the dark enlightens the people of Italia?

Id: [0x0004DF50]
The Pythagorean unifier is in that temple. We both know it. That number is coupled to all nature, all things. It is the source. With it, we can open the minds and souls of men. We can fill them with knowledge.

Id: [0x0004DF51]
As above, so below.

Id: [0x0004DF52]
That is the Hermetic vow. Together, we will make mankind into gods. Now, show me the entrance.

Id: [0x0004DF53]
Why? Do you not know where it is?

Id: [0x0004DF54]
How could I?

Id: [0x0004DF55]
You know mankind's wants and needs, I assumed discovering the location of a simple hidden entrance would be an easy feat.

Id: [0x0004DF56]
You-- [yells in anger]

Id: [0x0004DF57]
Where is it?

Id: [0x0004DF58]
Guess.

Id: [0x0004DF59]
I am finished with your obstinacy. Procedete! (Do it!)

Id: [0x0004DF5A]
My body may feel pain, but my mind will remain unharmed.

Id: [0x0004DF5B]
Impressive. [to his followers] Do it again.

Id: [0x0004DF5C]
Again.

Id: [0x0004DF5D]
Stop.

Id: [0x0004DF5E]
Ezio Auditore!

Id: [0x0004DF5F]
You who arrested Cesare Borgia, who stopped the spread of Roman ignorance, convince our friend Leonardo to open the temple and usher in the golden age of mankind.

Id: [0x0004DF60]
Should I persuade "our friend" by kicking him? Or would you rather I used my knife?

Id: [0x0004DF61]
On the contrary, there is nothing I would like more than an amiable solution. Help Leonardo see reason. With the Pythagorean unifier we will remake humanity together.

Id: [0x0004DF62]
Not under my creed.

Id: [0x0004DF63]
Then the revolution will begin without you. Ucciderlo! (Kill him!)

Id: [0x0004DF64]
Leonardo, I must know.

Id: [0x0004DF65]
Please, for the future of mankind.

Id: [0x0004DF66]
Tell me!

Id: [0x0004DF67]
We are running out of time!

Id: [0x0004DF68]
Go! Stop him!

Id: [0x0004DF69]
[Screams while falling]

Id: [0x0004DF6A]
Very foolish.

Id: [0x0004DF6B]
Stay away from me, Assassino!

Id: [0x0004DF6C]
Firenze against Venezia, Venezia against Roma. Ignorant group against ignorant group forever, is that what you want?

Id: [0x0004DF6D]
We are all the same underneath yet these people persist in their witch hunts!

Id: [0x0004DF6E]
You intend to banish us back to our primitive origins?

Id: [0x0004DF6F]
You...an Assassin...the enemy of knowledge?

Id: [0x0004DF70]
One must choose to search for truth. Forcing it on others accomplishes little.

Id: [0x0004DF71]
These lost people...warring kingdoms...I would have ended their suffering.

Id: [0x0004DF72]
Che tu possa conoscere la verità nella morte. (May you know the truth in death.) Requiescat in pace. (Rest in peace.)

Id: [0x0004DF73]
Come. Let us leave this place.

Id: [0x0004DF74]
We cannot, Ezio. Not without reaching the final room of the temple.

Id: [0x0004DF75]
You are hurt.

Id: [0x0004DF76]
I will be fine. If that number is left intact, we risk another madman discovering it.

Id: [0x0004DF77]
Coming?

Id: [0x0004DF78]
Take that torch. I will lead the way.

Id: [0x0004DF79]
Thank goodness I sent Massimo to look for my paintings, it delayed their progress significantly.

Id: [0x0004DF7A]
The Pythagoreans believed that the soul moved through cracks in the earth, like a beam of light. It ignites fire, which symbolizes knowledge.

Id: [0x0004DF7B]
I suppose Salai is out having fun spending my hard-earned florins?

Id: [0x0004DF7C]
He is safe at home.

Id: [0x0004DF7D]
I am relieved...about the florins of course.

Id: [0x0004DF7E]
You do not need to lie to me. Salai fits you. I approve.

Id: [0x0004DF7F]
I...

Id: [0x0004DF80]
Leonardo Da Vinci at a loss for words? That is a first.

Id: [0x0004DF81]
Ezio, the mirrors! Perhaps you can use them to concentrate the light in order to burn through that rope.

Id: [0x0004DF82]
You are almost there!

Id: [0x0004DF83]
Easy for you to say.

Id: [0x0004DF84]
We must continue onward!

Id: [0x0004DF85]
This room could use some light.

Id: [0x0004DF86]
Do you hear that? The sound of wind.

Id: [0x0004DF87]
The Pythagoreans believed all the forces of nature could be whittled down to numbers. Mathematica can then act on nature, allowing man to harness nature's power.

Id: [0x0004DF88]
I see air flowing around that cloth. You might want to go look.

Id: [0x0004DF89]
The wheel is turning. You are channeling the air, keep going!

Id: [0x0004DF8A]
Only one final room before we reach the center!

Id: [0x0004DF8B]
How unexpected! Delightful.

Id: [0x0004DF8C]
The fire of knowledge.

Id: [0x0004DF8D]
Correct! Harmony was achieved for the Pythagoreans when multiplicity became unity. When many thoughts combine to form one original idea.

Id: [0x0004DF8E]
Everything seems to be unified around that central platform, but the channels around it must come from somewhere else.

Id: [0x0004DF8F]
Yes! How enlightening!

Id: [0x0004DF90]
Very funny.

Id: [0x0004DF91]
Unity is achieved! But the door is not opening.

Id: [0x0004DF92]
Leonardo, come here.

Id: [0x0004DF93]
Recognize these symbols?

Id: [0x0004DF94]
No...Wait. These are the symbols that were shown to me by the Apple of Eden! They are in the wrong order. Let me just...if I rearrange these...done!

Id: [0x0004DF95]
I know this architecture.

Id: [0x0004DF96]
Those are not Pythagorean symbols. 43 39 19 N 75 27 42 W. [beat]  Nothing. The Cult of Hermes is wrong. The number is meaningless.

Id: [0x0004DF97]
You are leaving?

Id: [0x0004DF98]
No mere number can repair the world. Come, my friend, help me charter a ship to Navarre. I must finish with Cesare Borgia.

Id: [0x0004DF99]
It is not intended for us.

Id: [0x0004DF9A]
Ezio. What are you not telling me?

Id: [0x0004DF9B]
What else are you working on?

Id: [0x0004DF9C]
Well, I have begun several dissection studies. Then King Louis XII seems interested in hiring me as an engineer. Oh yes, I am thinking of repainting the St. John lost in the Villa fire. Salai would model for it again, of course. Then, perhaps I will study a woman with child to see how her body changes.

Id: [0x0004DF9D]
Interesting. Tell me more.

Id: [0x0004DF9E]
You can sedate Desmond now, we have the information we needed.

Id: [0x0004DF9F]
It's too late, the damage is done. He seems to have entered some kind of coma.

Id: [0x0004DFA0]
He'll find his way out. He always has in the past.

Id: [0x0004DFA1]
I've run the data through the computer. We have a location for the temple.

Id: [0x0004DFA2]
Then what are you waiting for? Let's go.

Id: [0x0004DFA3]
Merda.

Id: [0x0004DFA4]
Bah.

Id: [0x0004DFA5]
(forlorn sigh)

Id: [0x0004DFA6]
Oh well...

Id: [0x0004DFA7]
Where is my luck...

Id: [0x0004DFA8]
'Tsk inhale' ono

Id: [0x0004DFA9]
Aww...

Id: [0x0004DFAA]
Ah.. next time.

Id: [0x0004DFAB]
Nice.

Id: [0x0004DFAC]
Bene!

Id: [0x0004DFAD]
Alright.

Id: [0x0004DFAE]
Luck is with me!

Id: [0x0004DFAF]
Si, va bene!

Id: [0x0004DFB0]
I will take that.

Id: [0x0004DFB1]
Ha!

Id: [0x0004DFB2]
Yes!

Id: [0x0004DFB3]
I need to find more coin.

Id: [0x0004DFB4]
That is all I brought with me.

Id: [0x0004DFB5]
Hmm, not enough money.

Id: [0x0004DFB6]
I seem to be short a few florins.

Id: [0x0004DFB7]
Care to sweeten the pot, amico?

Id: [0x0004DFB8]
Lets up the ante, yes?

Id: [0x0004DFB9]
Care for a roll?

Id: [0x0004DFBA]
Come play with me friend!

Id: [0x0004DFBB]
You feeling lucky amico?

Id: [0x0004DFBC]
Ah, per la malora!

Id: [0x0004DFBD]
Next time…

Id: [0x0004DFBE]
Merda!

Id: [0x0004DFBF]
Where has my luck fled to?

Id: [0x0004DFC0]
Yes, alright!

Id: [0x0004DFC1]
I love money!

Id: [0x0004DFC2]
Bene, bene, bene!

Id: [0x0004DFC3]
Mmm-hhmmm!

Id: [0x0004DFC4]
Where is Leonardo da Vinci?

Id: [0x0004DFC5]
Signore Massimo.

Id: [0x0004DFC6]
Leonardo. Can it be that you uncovered the temple entrance?

Id: [0x0004DFC7]
A breakthrough has been made! [beat] I apologize for the late hour.

Id: [0x0004DFC8]
Think nothing of it! Your enthusiasm spurs me onward.

Id: [0x0004DFC9]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0004DFCA]
I located my symbols in your book.

Id: [0x0004DFCB]
Ah! So you saw these numerals in the Piece of Eden. They are said to safeguard the Pythagorean Unifier in the final room of the temple, but the exact combination has been lost.

Id: [0x0004DFCC]
In here.

Id: [0x0004DFCD]
If I may inquire, what do you believe this Unifier...what do you believe it is?

Id: [0x0004DFCE]
The perfect number. A number believed to have made the world. An ancient sect of mathematicians led by Pythagoras of Grecia discovered the secret. Some say that the one who speaks it alters the physical. I, however, believe the Unifier has a far more powerful purpose.

Id: [0x0004DFCF]
A number believed to have made the world. Some say that the one who speaks it alters the physical. I, however, believe the Unifier has a far more powerful purpose.

Id: [0x0004DFD0]
But further research remains useless without the Pythagorean temple.

Id: [0x0004DFD1]
Leave it to me. I am on the verge of finding the entrance, and now I have help.

Id: [0x0004DFD2]
Perhaps one day the mind will be as powerful as that device. [beat, musing] As above, so below.

Id: [0x0004DFD3]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0004DFD4]
Give us the Piece of Eden.

Id: [0x0004DFD5]
Stop!

Id: [0x0004DFD6]
What have they done?

Id: [0x0004DFD7]
Cleaning shop?

Id: [0x0004DFD8]
Ezio? How glad I am to see you!

Id: [0x0004DFD9]
This is not my doing. Men have been chasing me, they seek the Piece of Eden.

Id: [0x0004DFDA]
Who?

Id: [0x0004DFDB]
Those who follow the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. I recognized their robes from the Medici court at Firenze. Noblemen there whispered to me of alchemical rituals hidden from the uninitiated in which men were elevated to the realm of the divine. After condemnation from the Church, the students of Hermes moved into the shadows, but their numbers have grown. Something about my research must have drawn them here.

Id: [0x0004DFDC]
Those who follow the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. Noblemen at the court of Firenze whispered to me of alchemical rituals hidden from the uninitiated in which men were elevated to the realm of the divine. Something about my research must have drawn them here.

Id: [0x0004DFDD]
Then we should not linger. Come.

Id: [0x0004DFDE]
It is too powerful. It must be hidden outside the domain of men.

Id: [0x0004DFDF]
What a shame, hiding a masterpiece where no one will ever see it.

Id: [0x0004DFE0]
What do you intend to do?

Id: [0x0004DFE1]
Plant a seed.

Id: [0x0004DFE2]
[screams]

Id: [0x0004DFE3]
What do you want?

Id: [0x0004DFE4]
We have only the most noble of goals, Assassin. To elevate man.

Id: [0x0004DFE5]
This Apple does not create, it destroys.

Id: [0x0004DFE6]
In your hands maybe. Hermes the Thrice Greatest spoke of a path to enlighten the human mind. That device will lead us to the source, to the Unifier.

Id: [0x0004DFE7]
It is not meant for you.

Id: [0x0004DFE8]
You would be content to leave mankind in the dirt, while you keep the fire for yourself?

Id: [0x0004DFE9]
Only man can elevate man. No magical shortcut exists.

Id: [0x0004DFEA]
Lies!

Id: [0x0004DFEB]
Now...I will never know the fire.

Id: [0x0004DFEC]
Wrong, it burns within us all.

Id: [0x0004DFED]
He told us to wait...we should have listened.

Id: [0x0004DFEE]
Requiescati in pace.

Id: [0x0004DFEF]
Seventy-two.

Id: [0x0004DFF0]
It is done. The Piece of Eden has been hidden.

Id: [0x0004DFF1]
Perhaps, the answer to our salvation lies not in the monuments that crumble with the ages, but within man himself. Knowledge is not lost, as we feared, but passed on, from generation to generation, slowly taking shape. Waiting to awaken once more.

Id: [0x0004DFF2]
Impatience brought this upon us.

Id: [0x0004DFF3]
Separate thou the earth from the fire. You are the light of the lights and darkness will flee from your path.

Id: [0x0004DFF4]
Children of Hermes. With my assistance, Leonardo will lead us to the Unifier. Then, we act.

Id: [0x0004DFF5]
And the divine shall walk the Earth again!

Id: [0x0004DFF6]
And the light of heaven will transform mankind forever!

Id: [0x0004DFF7]
And the fire of heaven shall be ours once more!

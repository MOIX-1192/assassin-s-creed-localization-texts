{NAME} the Hydra’s Head

Id: [0x000D3057]
{FULLNAME} often carried the heads of those who died by his blade. He called the heads his generals and together, they were the Hydra. Still, they let him lead…

Id: [0x000D3058]
{NAME}, Protector of Dryads

Id: [0x000D3059]
{FULLNAME} once protected a small village from a large fire, stopping it before it could reach the forest. The rumor spread that dryads were within and ultimately gifted him with a godly power.

Id: [0x000D305A]
{NAME} the Thunderclap

Id: [0x000D305B]

Artemis

Id: [0x000D32AA]
Azeus

Id: [0x000D33EA]
Silver Tongue

Id: [0x000D33EB]
A lover of art in a family of warriors, {FULLNAME} was always thought weak until he played his family members against one another. Soon enough, only he was left, along with his family’s fortune.

Id: [0x000D33F2]
Greedy

Id: [0x000D33F3]
If the best way to get friends was to buy them, this opportunist preferred to have enemies. {FULLNAME} grew up poor and with friends. He'd rather be rich and lonely. Nobody had a problem with that.

Id: [0x000D33F6]
Devotee

Id: [0x000D33F7]
{FULLNAME} was raised by priests after his mother died during childbirth and his father died in battle. {NAME} devoted his life to piety, hoping to honor their memory with every action he took.

Id: [0x000D346C]
{NAME} the Devastator

Id: [0x000D346D]
{NAME} the Laughing Crow

Id: [0x000D346E]
Pagai

Id: [0x000D346F]
From the small coastal town of Pagai, {FULLNAME} knew her way around a ship - and how to work a crew - better than most sailors, though for far deadlier purposes.

Id: [0x000D3470]
Skyros

Id: [0x000D3471]
His mother told {FULLNAME} stories of Theseus in Skyros almost every night. {FULLNAME} grew to have an irrational fear of cliffs and high places, lest he be thrown to his death.

{NAME} the Capricious

Id: [0x000D35D6]
Warmonger

Id: [0x000D35D7]
{FULLNAME} claimed he was raised on the battlefield and that the first thing he held was a spear. Like most people who make their identity about one thing, {NAME} was never seen as more than a warrior.

Id: [0x000D35E8]
Theoros

Id: [0x000D3607]
{NAME} the Wit’s Edge

Id: [0x000D3608]
{FULLNAME} carried a sword, though no blade was as sharp as his tongue. To him peace was the product of a strong alliance. And an alliance was the product of an enemy {NAME} had shamed.

Id: [0x000D3609]
{NAME} the Hippogriff

Id: [0x000D360A]
{FULLNAME} was noble. Proud. Strong. Fierce. And, like the hippogriff, was many things at once. He could be deceitful, cunning, a skilled liar - whatever it took to get what he wanted.

Id: [0x000D360B]
{NAME}, Son of Kings

Id: [0x000D360C]
After living a life of poverty, {NAME} told a simple lie in an influential ear, and was known shortly after as the Son of Kings. He was respected and adored, but clearly nobody stopped to ask why.

Id: [0x000D360D]
{NAME}, Bringer of Fates

Id: [0x000D360E]
{FULLNAME} claimed he never killed, but simply fulfilled the wishes of the Fates. It seems very coincidental, though, that the Fates would always wish his enemies a long, torturous death.

Id: [0x000D360F]
{NAME} the Heartless

Id: [0x000D3610]
There were never any friends in the world of The Heartless. There was only fodder… those he could throw at the spears of his enemies until the battle was won.

Id: [0x000D3613]
{NAME} the Hollow

Id: [0x000D3614]
{FULLNAME} never found any joy in life aside from his rather unflinching ruthlessness. No matter how gruesome the battle or how large the loss, his hollow expression remained unchanged.

Id: [0x000D3617]
{NAME} the Grave Digger

Id: [0x000D3618]
People claimed {FULLNAME} could be seen dragging bodies into graves well into the night. With care, he rested coins in each of their mouths, closed their eyes, and covered the bodies with dirt.

Id: [0x000D3619]
{NAME} the Great Protector

Id: [0x000D361A]
There was no better ally than {FULLNAME} when it came to protecting those he loved. To fear him was to fear his allies in equal measure, for where they went, he protected them.

Id: [0x000D361B]
{NAME} the Drunken Bard

Id: [0x000D361C]
According to {FULLNAME}, there could be no love or life or alliance, without first having wine. It’s said he blessed his friends as Dionysos might - with a drunken song and a satisfying hangover.

Id: [0x000D3623]
{NAME}, Guardian of Demeter

Id: [0x000D3624]
{NAME} guarded the golden fields as they were harvested and the olive trees as they were plucked. He considered himself a broker of peace and bounty, and he was rewarded with great wealth.

Id: [0x000D3625]
{NAME} the Grave Thief

Id: [0x000D3626]
Most mercenaries gained their wealth from completing contracts, but in rare cases, it’s said some like {NAME} took a different route. People claimed they often saw {NAME} late at night, digging into the earth where a body was buried earlier in the day. He grew far wealthier during times of war.

Id: [0x000D3629]
{NAME}, Servant of Hephaistos

Id: [0x000D362A]
The world is a smith's fire, and {NAME} was a blade forged in it. Other leaders were simply crops for him to cleave, leaving their riches for him to reap. In time, his riches were reaped as well.

Id: [0x000D362B]
{NAME}, Student of Hermes

Id: [0x000D362C]
{FULLNAME} was a merchant first and a warrior second. He measured life in profits. Those who knew him said he made decisions solely on how much a person was worth. He must have viewed himself highly.

Id: [0x000D362D]
{NAME}, King of the Vagabonds

Id: [0x000D362E]
A paradox, perhaps: the King of Vagabonds was at once reviled by the social, political, and religious elite around him, yet he kept his power purely by being beloved by the commoners he protected.

Id: [0x000D362F]
{NAME} the Tamer

Id: [0x000D3630]
When {FULLNAME} stopped fearing the gods, he lost all fear of everything else. He went from taming the world's wildest animals to its wildest armies, killing those who refused to follow his lead.

Id: [0x000D3637]
{NAME} the Sun Chaser

Id: [0x000D3638]
There are no bounds for an ambitious leader, and there were no ambitious leaders like the pious {FULLNAME}. He intended to unite all the temples under his banner. He failed.

Id: [0x000D363B]
{NAME} the Great Sorcerer

Id: [0x000D363C]
A curse from a witch can be a vexing thing, indeed. A curse from {FULLNAME} was always fatal. Armies crumbled and leaders fell from the fear that {NAME} instilled in them.

Id: [0x000D363D]
{NAME} the Master Logician

Id: [0x000D363E]
{NAME} the Sharp-Witted

Id: [0x000D363F]
{NAME} the Peaceful

Id: [0x000D3640]
{NAME}, Son of Medea

Id: [0x000D364D]
{NAME} the Griffin

Id: [0x000D364E]
{NAME}, Harvester of Wheat

Id: [0x000D364F]
{NAME} the Elder

Id: [0x000D3650]
{NAME} the Compulsive

Id: [0x000D3655]
{NAME}, Servant of the Furies

Id: [0x000D3656]
{NAME} the Blessed

Id: [0x000D3657]
{NAME}, Son of Athena

Id: [0x000D36D6]
{NAME}, Bringer of Crows

Id: [0x000D36D7]
{FULLNAME} was taught battles don’t end until none are left standing. Many claimed they saw {NAME} release his crows at battle’s end. He would watch as they found their dinner amongst his former enemies.

Id: [0x000D371D]
{NAME} the Ogre

Id: [0x000D371E]
{FULLNAME} led his band of warriors for years, leaving a trail of smashed skulls as his signature. None could fathom a reason for his brutal attacks, but all knew to fear them.

Id: [0x000D3721]
{NAME} the Fire Bringer

Id: [0x000D3722]
{FULLNAME} was known to end his battles by setting fire to the battlefield. It’s said he always started with the first enemy he killed that day. How he found that initial body, nobody knows.

Id: [0x000D3725]
{NAME}, Sailor on the Blood Sea

Id: [0x000D3726]
No port was ever safe when {FULLNAME} sailed past. Even his crewmembers feared for the lives of the people they met during their travels. Many port towns said a red sea followed {NAME} in his wake.

Id: [0x000D3727]
{NAME} the Fearless

Id: [0x000D3728]
{FULLNAME}'s army always pushed forward as if it had experienced death once before and no longer feared it. The truth is they were simply more afraid of {NAME}.

Id: [0x000D372B]
{NAME} the Bear-Clawed

Id: [0x000D372C]
{FULLNAME} claimed he and his troops were reported dead after an ambush. As the story goes, he emerged from the forest wearing the heads and claws of the bears he had slaughtered barehanded.

Id: [0x000D372D]
{NAME}, Servant of Ares

Id: [0x000D372E]
{FULLNAME} was almost sacrificed to Ares at birth. He claimed Ares spared his life and demanded repayment through the deaths of his enemies. {NAME} was always happy to oblige such a request.

Id: [0x000D3735]
{NAME}, Servant of Athena

Id: [0x000D3736]
Carrying an olive branch everywhere he went, {FULLNAME} prayed the goddess would bring him wisdom in war. For a while, it worked. Few were as wise in the agora or as feared on the battlefield as he.

Id: [0x000D3737]
{NAME} the Sage

Id: [0x000D3738]
{FULLNAME} spent much time on the battlefield - long enough to know the battlefield was no place to spend a life. He hardly spoke, but when he did, all heeded his counsel.

Id: [0x000D373B]
{NAME}, Protector of Truth

Id: [0x000D373C]
Many suspected {NAME} told his associates to spread word of his title. Those who debated the truthfulness of it felt the weight of his army. Perhaps we should all create names for ourselves.

Id: [0x000D373D]
{NAME} the Guided Javelin

Id: [0x000D373E]
{NAME} earned his title defending the city walls. It was there he learned how to impale his enemies from a distance, and the value of a strong defense. Unfortunately, this didn’t work in the agora.

Id: [0x000D373F]
{NAME}, Bringer of Hypnos

Id: [0x000D3740]
In the late hours, by the light of fire, {FULLNAME} entertained generals, politicians, and philosophers, extracting information, aid, or their last breath. It was always a gamble for those invited.

Id: [0x000D3743]
{NAME} the Devious Snake

Id: [0x000D3744]
{FULLNAME} believed there was no reason for a plan if it was known to anyone else. He plotted in secret like a hungry snake… unpredictable and carefully watching for the perfect moment to strike.

Id: [0x000D3745]
{NAME} the Living Riddle

Id: [0x000D3746]
A former student of Sokrates, {FULLNAME} often left audiences enthralled while leaving his enemies confused. Many claimed the confusion wasn’t because {NAME} was smart, but quite the opposite.

Id: [0x000D3747]
{NAME} the Great Deceiver

Id: [0x000D3748]
Some politicians relied on truth to garner respect. Others, like {NAME}, chose a different path. Called one of the greatest liars of his time, he gained trust solely due to how convincing he was.

Id: [0x000D3749]
{NAME} the Agora

Id: [0x000D374A]
If {FULLNAME} was known for one thing, it was the moment in the agora when he yelled “I am the assembly!” Surprisingly, this went well for him, but great things always come to an electrifying end.

Id: [0x000D374B]
{NAME} the Cold-Hearted

Id: [0x000D374C]
There is one story of {FULLNAME} that has lasted longer than any other about him. As he received his punishment of lashings in front of a crowd, it’s said his laugher drowned out the noise of the entire crowd until the only sound was him. Pain, to him, was fun. So he inflicted it on others.

Id: [0x000D3755]
{NAME} the Moon King

Id: [0x000D3756]
{FULLNAME} was a priest of Artemis until bandits ruined his temple. A lone survivor, he became embroiled in a lunar cult and pledged to bring suffering to all who would harm his beloved goddess.

Id: [0x000D3757]
{NAME}, Son of Aphrodite

Id: [0x000D3758]
Loyalty, trust, and honor were fool's errands to {NAME}. He believed the gods were glorious because they were beautiful, and because they were self-serving, which {NAME} understood all too well.

Id: [0x000D375F]
{NAME} the Black Lion

Id: [0x000D3760]
Stories claim {FULLNAME} was captured by the enemy, but he broke his chains with brute force and walked free. It was only ever a rumor, of course… one the Black Lion never tried to quell.

Id: [0x000D3771]
{NAME} the Weeping Terror

Id: [0x000D3772]
Some assumed {FULLNAME} was broken by tragedy or a lost love. It’s said he never cried for anything in the past, but for the horrible things he was about to do. If true, perhaps he felt some remorse.

Id: [0x000D3775]
{NAME}, Worshipper of Hera

Id: [0x000D3776]
Just as Hera became queen of Mount Olympos, {FULLNAME} rose to power turning careful bonds into strong alliances. Those bonds were rarely tested, for his temper often turned to deadly wrath.

Id: [0x000D3777]
{NAME} the Bare-Chested

Id: [0x000D3778]
In a contest of confidence, it’s likely {FULLNAME} would have won. Enemies and allies both claim he would walk into battle bare-chested, daring anyone to take him on. Idiocy can take many forms.

Id: [0x000D3779]
{NAME}, Leader of the Lonely

Id: [0x000D377A]
Caring for orphans and the lost children of infighting and war, {FULLNAME} ultimately gained their support when they grew up. With their help, {NAME} was able to do whatever he wished without reproach.

Id: [0x000D3785]
{NAME} the Centaur’s Servant

Id: [0x000D3786]

{NAME} the Symposiarch

Id: [0x000D382F]

{NAME} the Fearless Shark

{NAME} the Sophist

{NAME} the Wing-Footed

{NAME}, Warrior of Zeus

Warmonger

Id: [0x000D38E7]
Born to a family of generals and warriors in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} had his destiny laid out before him. Ruthless and merciless, he was an unstoppable force. At least for a little while.

Warmonger

Id: [0x000D38E9]

Warmonger

Id: [0x000D3906]

Id: [0x000D3907]
Warmonger

Id: [0x000D3908]

Id: [0x000D392D]
Silver Tongue

Id: [0x000D392E]

Silver Tongue

Id: [0x000D3930]
{FULLNAME} grew up as an advocate for peace after he saw his relatives suffer in the Greco-Persian war. He always believed the best defense was having a strong ally. His defense was incredibly weak.

Id: [0x000D3931]
Silver Tongue

Id: [0x000D3932]

Silver Tongue

Id: [0x000D3934]

Id: [0x000D398C]
Greedy

Id: [0x000D398D]
A lover of art, {FULLNAME} would have killed for a sculpture by Phidias. While he never did get one, he tried filling his home with other goods few could afford. He was happy for a time.

Id: [0x000D398E]
Greedy

Id: [0x000D398F]

Id: [0x000D3990]
Greedy

Id: [0x000D3991]
{FULLNAME} grew up in a strict household and was never allowed to have more than he earned. Once he escaped the tight hold of his mother, he "earned" more than he could ever need.

Id: [0x000D3992]
Greedy

Id: [0x000D3993]
Some believe wealth must be taken if it is so desired. {FULLNAME} believed the cost of wealth was often its weight in blood. The world gave nothing to him for free, so {NAME} chose to take it.

Id: [0x000D39BD]
Devotee

Devotee

Devotee

Id: [0x000D39C4]

Delphi

Id: [0x000D40C4]
{FULLNAME} always looked forward to the Pythian Games. Not as a competitor, but as a gambler - he made his fortune carefully placing bets on the athletes.

Id: [0x000D40C5]
Byzantion

Id: [0x000D40C6]
{FULLNAME} committed to pitting Athens and Sparta against each other so that his first love, Byzantion, could rise in the wake of their destruction.

Id: [0x000D40C8]
Assos

Id: [0x000D40C9]
A hired sword from distant Assos, {FULLNAME} cared less about the money she earned and more about finding the next victim for her blade. Killing was far from a job for her, but instead, a purpose.

Id: [0x000D40CA]
Aigosthena

Id: [0x000D40CB]
Born on a small boat off the coast of Aigosthena, {FULLNAME} was far more comfortable on the seas and near Poseidon. He was always a drifter, stopping on land only when completely necessary.

Id: [0x000D40CC]
Persepolis

Id: [0x000D40CD]
{FULLNAME} believed the world would fall to the great Persian Empire. She thought if she could cause enough chaos in Persepolis, everyone else could do the rest.

Id: [0x000D40CE]
Tyros

Id: [0x000D40CF]
With Persia in a time of relative peace, jobs for mercenaries were few and far between for {FULLNAME} in Tyros. Here, however, were ample opportunities.

Id: [0x000D40D0]
Skythia

Id: [0x000D40D1]
{FULLNAME} worked by honoring Skythia's traditional mercantile life, but after a bloody skirmish with armed bandits, he discovered his temperament was more suited for war.

Id: [0x000D40D2]
Samos

Id: [0x000D40D3]
Tired of the peaceful confines of island life on Samos, {FULLNAME} took a job as a rower on a trireme. She soon found, though, that her rowing arms could be put to far more profitable and deadly uses as a mercenary.

Id: [0x000D40D4]
Korinth

Id: [0x000D40D5]
{FULLNAME} was apprenticed to an abusive and incompetent potter in Korinth. It’s said he ran away and was taken in by a group of mercenaries, but not before exacting revenge.

Id: [0x000D40D6]
Thebes

Id: [0x000D40D7]
Originally from Lakonia, {FULLNAME} often told people long stories about his life in Thebes to hide his past crimes.

Id: [0x000D40D8]
Megara

Id: [0x000D40D9]
A severe problem with authority led to {FULLNAME} being kicked out of Megara's military. He ended up finding the freedom of a mercenary’s life to be his calling.

Id: [0x000D40DA]
Sparta

Id: [0x000D40DB]
{FULLNAME} could hardly stand the weaklings he found outside Sparta. When he fought, he fought to teach fortitude to a population he viewed as engorged, indulgent, and expendable.

Id: [0x000D40DC]
Melos

Id: [0x000D40DD]
{FULLNAME} began his ruthless career by working in the family business. Early in life, he was tasked with defending ships along the local trade routes of Melos. It paid well, but he came to learn that taking the ships down himself was far more lucrative.

Id: [0x000D40DE]
Plataia

Id: [0x000D40DF]
{FULLNAME} organized a militia to rid Plataia of a bandit problem, but quickly found she could kill in greater numbers when working alone and undetected.

Id: [0x000D40E0]
Memphis

Id: [0x000D40E1]
From a wealthy family in Memphis, {FULLNAME} entered mercenary life for the two reasons most mercenaries did: it paid well, and killing was fun.

Id: [0x000D40E2]
Athens

Id: [0x000D40E3]
{FULLNAME} claimed he never saw any city as perfect as Athens. He was known to talk for hours about every detail of the people, food, and government if anyone let him - or got him drunk enough.

Id: [0x000D40E4]
Thermopylai

Id: [0x000D40E5]
Growing up in Thermopylai, {FULLNAME}, like many others, was regaled with stories of Leonidas. She, too, wanted to become a great warrior, but on her terms - not in a legend’s shadow.

Id: [0x000D40E6]
Magna Grecia

Id: [0x000D40E7]
{FULLNAME} spent much of her time at the docks in Magna Grecia, often being told by captains to get out of the way and let the men work. She vowed she would one day have a crew of her own following any order she shouted. She kept her promise.

Id: [0x000D40E8]
Mykonos

Id: [0x000D40E9]
Living near to the neighboring island of Delos, {FULLNAME} found a friend there. They trained together, became strong together, and occasionally cooperated for mutual profit. That is, until one of them turned on the other. Stories are still unclear on who began the betrayal.

Id: [0x000D40EA]
Samothrake

Id: [0x000D40EB]
At a young age, {FULLNAME} vowed she would leave Samothrake and never return. It’s said she hated her home so much, she commanded her ship to avoid even the sight of the island.

Id: [0x000D40EC]
Thessalia

Id: [0x000D40ED]
Growing up, {FULLNAME} made the yearly trek to the peaks of Mount Olympos to leave offerings for the gods. In exchange, it’s said they blessed her with great strength.

Id: [0x000D40EE]
Croton

Id: [0x000D40EF]
{FULLNAME} carried the regret of leaving Croton behind. If there was a future for him, it was there. He always fought to win, but ultimately he fought to win the right to return home.

Id: [0x000D40F0]
Carthage

Id: [0x000D40F1]
{FULLNAME} imagined that with victory would come spoils. He decided there was no greater place than Carthage, and no greater spoils than what was freely offered there.

Id: [0x000D40F2]
Kurnos

Id: [0x000D40F3]
{FULLNAME} carried the memories of Kurnos with her. The wild nights that turned dark, turned bloody. Then one night that caused her to flee, to hide, and to kill to survive. And survive she did.

Id: [0x000D40F4]
Pylos

Id: [0x000D40F5]
{FULLNAME} liked to sneak from her home in Pylos to the Temple of Zeus, where she spoke to the statues like they were friends. Some said the temple spirits followed her and blessed her.

Id: [0x000D40F6]
Dekelia

Id: [0x000D40F7]
{FULLNAME} hadn’t seen a horse until leaving Dekelia as an adult, and barely ever learned to ride one. She could direct a fleet of ships without opening her eyes - she saw no reason to entrust her travel to a beast.

Id: [0x000D40F8]
Thasos

Id: [0x000D40F9]
{FULLNAME} grew strong as a quarryman in the marble pit of Thasos. There, he led a revolt. He became a mercenary following the successful revolt, but vowed to return to Thasos to burn it to the ground. He never did.

Id: [0x000D40FA]
Argos

Id: [0x000D40FB]
All his life {FULLNAME} longed to perform at the theater in Argos. However, there wasn’t a soul who would cast him. After exacting revenge on all those who had rejected his performances, he found a new passion as a mercenary.

Id: [0x000D40FC]
Alexandria

Id: [0x000D40FD]
{FULLNAME}’s past involved desecrating temples, statues, and what she saw as pathetic cultural achievements. To her, no greater city had been built than Alexandria, and no greater person forged than an Alexandrian.

Id: [0x000D40FE]
Massalia

Id: [0x000D40FF]
Growing up in Massalia, {FULLNAME} saw no extremes like those in Athens. Gluttony and poverty. Freedom and servitude. If she was meant to be inspired, she was - to wipe Athenians off the map.

Id: [0x000D4100]
Krete

Id: [0x000D4101]
{FULLNAME} carried a small, tightly-stoppered bottle of sand from Krete. She said if she had her homeland with her everywhere she went, nothing could stop her.

Id: [0x000D4102]
Persia

Id: [0x000D4103]
{FULLNAME} promised himself that he’d return to his home in Persia before he died. It’s said he had nightmares where he could no longer remember the name of the town he was from. Unfortunately his nightmares became reality, and he never made it back.

Id: [0x000D4104]
Trachis

Id: [0x000D4105]
{FULLNAME} made a name for herself after allegedly killing every bear on the hills outside Trachis. She made her fortune selling all the pelts for a high price. Few dared haggle.

Id: [0x000D4106]
Tegea

Id: [0x000D4107]
{FULLNAME} left his home in Tegea, as well his two daughters and his son. He trusted them to keep the family farm running until he could return with enough drachmae to give them a brighter future.

Id: [0x000D4108]
Syrakousai

Id: [0x000D4109]
{FULLNAME} wrote countless letters to his mother. It’s said he tried sending one home to Syrakousai each night. After a while, he stopped sending the letters altogether. He wasn’t sure they ever reached her, and since he was always on the move, he never received one back.

Id: [0x000D410A]
Thrake

Id: [0x000D410B]
If there was one thing {FULLNAME} didn’t miss about her homeland of Thrake, it was the cold nights on the steppes. Any day that required her to wear warm clothes was a terrible day for her.

Id: [0x000D410C]
Knossos

Id: [0x000D410D]
From a family of wealthy traders in Knossos, {FULLNAME} sailed in triremes and conquered the captains on them her entire life.

Id: [0x000D4132]
Skythia

Id: [0x000D4133]
Originally part of a war band on the plains of Skythia, {FULLNAME} traveled far from home to see the world. It’s said she left a bloody trail behind her, but only ever looked forward.

Id: [0x000D4134]
Korinth

Id: [0x000D4135]
Living in a place that rivaled Athens in wealth, {FULLNAME} was known for often flashing his good fortune, claiming his wealth alone would make Korinth the richest polis.

Id: [0x000D4136]
Thebes

Id: [0x000D4137]
{FULLNAME} would have slaughtered every soldier in the world if it meant he could taste a home-cooked Theban dinner one more time. He claimed the so called “delicacies” found elsewhere had no place in his stomach.

Id: [0x000D413A]
Magna Grecia

Id: [0x000D413B]
There’s one story that {FULLNAME}'s seasickness was so severe on the trip from Magna Grecia to the Peloponnese that he never voluntarily made the trip back home. It’s believed he made the trip just once more, but after making sure he was passed out drunk.

Id: [0x000D413C]
Mykonos

Id: [0x000D413D]
Much like the battle between Herakles and the invincible Giants on Mykonos, {FULLNAME} preferred to lure her enemies close before attacking with all her strength.

Id: [0x000D413E]
Samothrake

Id: [0x000D413F]
With hands scarred from quarrying stone on Samothrake's mountains, {FULLNAME} preferred to pay others to do even the most menial of physical tasks so he didn’t have to. He claimed he did more than most would ever do, so he deserved the break.

Id: [0x000D4141]
Thasos

Id: [0x000D4142]
{FULLNAME} honed her strength working in the marble pits of Thasos. The muscles she used to cut stone were the very same ones she uses to cut down her enemies.

Id: [0x000D41FA]
{NAME} the Tedious

Id: [0x000D41FB]
Legend has it men have died listening to {FULLNAME} drone on for too long. Some say victims starved to death, others that they were killed by the gods out of pity. Whether they were aware of what they were doing and how they were viewed, who can say for sure?

Id: [0x000D4206]
{NAME} the Joyful

Id: [0x000D4207]
It’s simply a fact that some enjoy killing much more than others. It’s said that {FULLNAME}’s face would contort in pure contentment every time she drew her blade across her target’s throat, or watched as people tried escaping from a town she lit on fire.

Id: [0x000D420A]
{NAME} the Toothless

Id: [0x000D420B]
{FULLNAME} was a resourceful misthios who had the bad habit of chewing on her drachmae when she earned it. Some say she was once cheated out of payment when the coins she was given were fake. Others claim she simply liked the taste.

Id: [0x000D4210]
{NAME} the Fury of the Waters

Id: [0x000D4211]
{FULLNAME} made a name for herself by turning Poseidon’s seas red whenever she set sail. It’s said she had no care for the ships she sailed, and she would happily ruin her own in combat if it meant taking the enemy’s ship as a prize.

Id: [0x000D4212]
{NAME} of the Chaos Void

Id: [0x000D4213]
Nobody knew where {FULLNAME} came from. Some believe from Hades. Others said Hades sent her into a realm beyond the gods, where she sat with nothing but her own pain and anger to churn in. All just stories, of course, but even so, there exists no information on her prior to adulthood.

Id: [0x000D4216]
{NAME} the Wolf Rider

Id: [0x000D4217]
If you asked {FULLNAME} where she lived, she’d tell you far into the woods where few traveled. Many claimed they saw her crawling into a wolf den at night, where she was protected by her pack. There have been tales of others who had an eerie connection to animals, but no proof.

Id: [0x000D4218]
{NAME} the Messenger

Id: [0x000D4219]
Some took their devotion to the gods a bit too far sometimes. There are countless reports that {FULLNAME} would carve strange poems into the skin of her enemies on behalf of them. Any who saw just one of those bodies did not wish to relive the moment by thinking of it any longer.

Id: [0x000D421E]
{NAME} the Destroyer of Plains

Id: [0x000D421F]
Once, to protect her leader from encroaching armies, {FULLNAME} set fields and crops ablaze. When the enemy came to attack, neither man nor horse could pass the engulfing fire. Of course, although the fire stopped the enemy, it also destroyed a vast amount of food the people desperately needed.

Id: [0x000D4224]
{NAME} of Tartaros

Id: [0x000D4225]
What is known of {FULLNAME} is mythical at best. Some say her hair turned to fire when she killed. With molten cores for eyes, she was a killer, certainly, and much more to many people. She also believed in never letting witnesses live, so the true question is how stories of her came to be.

Id: [0x000D4226]
{NAME} the Keto

Id: [0x000D4227]
Obsessed with drowning her victims, {FULLNAME} was a servant of the sea. Those who knew her claimed she couldn’t resist the sound of an underwater scream.

Id: [0x000D422C]
{NAME} the Bringer of Rain

Id: [0x000D422D]
Legend says {FULLNAME} once drew so much blood on a single battlefield, it ascended to the sky and turned the clouds red. The sun couldn’t break, and the crops drank the red rain. Clearly, a story, but an intriguing one at least.

Id: [0x000D4238]
{NAME} of the Horseless

Id: [0x000D4239]
Kicked off a horse as a child, {FULLNAME} preferred to travel as fast as her own feet could take her. It’s said she was swift enough to challenge even Hermes in a race, although there are no reports of him ever taking her up on the offer.

Id: [0x000D423A]
{NAME} the Great Cat

Id: [0x000D423B]
{FULLNAME} liked to stalk her prey deep in the mountains. Her footfalls were silent in the snow, and the trail of blood caking her footprints was the only sign she was there. It’s said she couldn’t feel the cold, and she would often hide underneath the snow for hours until worthy prey walked past.

Id: [0x000D4250]
{NAME} the Dragon-Skinned

Id: [0x000D4251]
It’s said {FULLNAME} was stabbed, lit aflame, and shot repeatedly with arrows, but never failed to laugh it off. Like a proud parent, she carried her scars and would happily spend all night regaling anyone who would listen with the stories of how she got them.

Id: [0x000D42A5]

Elpenor made an offer too good to be true: For a tidy sum, stop the Wolf of Sparta from overtaking the Athenians in Megaris. What no one knew was why.

UNUSED

Id: [0x001099F4]
Nikolaos made it clear: Kassandra’s mother was still alive. After a lifetime of solitude, she might have a family again.

Id: [0x001099F5]
Despite losing Phoibe, Perikles, and Athens itself, there was still hope: Kassandra soldiered on to Naxos to find her mother and reunite her family.

Id: [0x001099F6]
Few bastions of hope shone brighter on the Aegean than Naxos. With Kassandra's help, the leader known as Phoenix would keep it that way.

Id: [0x001099F7]
Kassandra began to reclaim her family. Now, it was time to reclaim her home. But finding her place among Spartans would prove more difficult than she assumed.

Kassandra and Deimos's paths had crossed before, but only now were they ready to collide. Fitting, then, that it should be on a battlefield.

Id: [0x001099F9]
The war intensified. Athens's frail democracy crumbled. So long as Kleon ruled the Delian League, no one was safe. Kassandra knew what she must do.

Id: [0x001099FA]
All great tales end where they began, as does this one. Kassandra had served her people well. Now came the time to return to them.

While dockers in the port were protected from pirate attacks, their livelihoods were threatened by ships being sunk and raided once they left port.

Id: [0x001F0C44]
Dockers, it is said, were always well informed about shipwrecks. One particular wreck carried a sword that a docker wanted to the bottom of the sea.

Id: [0x001F0C45]
While dockers inevitably knew where valuables could be salvaged from shipwrecks, actually retrieving the sunken booty often meant dealing with sharks.

Id: [0x001F0C46]

Herakles met the centaur Pholos here while hunting the Erymanthian boar. When Pholos opened a jar of wine, other armed centaurs arrived, and Herakles fought them, killing all - including Pholos.

Id: [0x001F2706]
Constructed by mortals, this resembled the cave on Ida where it was said that Zeus spent his youth. It was a grotto where Zeus was honored, located near the Kronion, the hill of Kronos.

Korinth was a major commercial city that controlled the Isthmus of Korinth through its two ports on the Aegean Sea and the Gulf of Korinth. Its position contributed to its prosperity in trades.

Id: [0x001F28C8]
Prostitution establishments, called porneions, were generally found in commercial areas - near ports, or agoras. The women who made this their trade could be either slaves or free women.

Id: [0x001F28C9]
This racetrack in the Korinthian agora is one of the oldest, built in the sixth century BCE. Its layout seems to confirm knowledge and the use of pi.

Id: [0x001F28CA]
The fountain of Peirene was in the middle of the city - near the road leading to the port. It was made up of many reservoirs, and, according to tradition, was connected with the spring on the Akrokorinth.

Id: [0x001F28CB]
The statue was made from the tree where Pentheus, who opposed the god’s cult, spied on both his mother and the Maenads in full Dionysian frenzy. He was pulled from the tree and torn limb from limb.

Tainaros was on the Peloponnese’s middle peninsula. It had red and black marble quarries and was also presumed to be a gateway to the underworld. It was guarded by Cerberus and was used by Herakles.

Id: [0x001F2946]
Like Mesoa, Pitana was one of the four original villages that formed Sparta. The Agiads, one of Sparta’s royal families, originated there.

Id: [0x001F2947]
A stoa was raised on the agora using Persian spoils after the Greco-Persian Wars. Columns nearby featured defeated Persians such as Darius’s general, Mardonios.

Id: [0x001F2948]
The Dromos course was for footraces, but it was also the place where young people were integrated into the city. Young Spartans offered sacrifices at a statue of Herakles when they became adults.

Id: [0x001F294A]
Forty years after the battle of Thermopylai - around 440 BC - Leonidas’s bones were brought to Sparta. A hero's shrine was set up, and a stele inscribed with the names of the soldiers at Thermopylai.

Id: [0x001F294B]
Orestes’s bones were returned to Sparta from Tegea on the Delphic Oracle’s advice. The Spartans thus enabled eternal protection of the hero, who was associated with the city’s legendary past.

Id: [0x001F294F]
With one of the largest territories, Sparta had a great land-based military power, governing all Lakedaimonians. They were divided into Spartan citizens, free residents, slaves, and mothax.

Id: [0x001F2958]
Sparta based its military power mainly on its land troops, preferring to use its allies’ naval contributions. Despite this, they used Glytheion as a port.

Id: [0x001F2959]
Mesoa was one of the four villages that united in the eighth century BCE to form the Spartan city-state under the authority of two families of kings: the Eurypontids and the Agiads.

Id: [0x001F295F]
This sanctuary sat on a rocky cliff overlooking the city and fertile plains. It was dedicated to the Spartan king Menelaus and his wife, Helen, over whom the Trojan War was fought for ten years.

Id: [0x001F2960]
The Perioikoi were a group of Spartan “subcitizens” who lived in the rural areas of Lakonia and Messenia. They had local autonomy, but seem to have been subject to a special tax.

Id: [0x001F2961]
The Perioikoi may not have been equal to Spartan citizens, but they too were involved in the military affairs of the Lakedaimonian army, serving as hoplites.

Id: [0x001F2965]
In addition to serving as a border, Mount Taygetos was a refuge for wildlife, like goats, boars, deer, and bears. Greeks hunted them with nets, traps, bows, and javelins.

"Be warned! One malákas pirate stole the wares I was going to sell at the market today. I’ll reward anyone who sinks the bastard’s ship for me!"

Id: [0x00201BA7]
"There’s a pirate who makes a fine trade by kidnapping people along the coast. Steer clear of his ship, unless you have the means to sink it!"

Id: [0x00201BA8]
"I used to trade in this harbor all the time, but a pirate’s told me it’s his territory now! Drive his boat to the depths, and you’ll be rewarded."

"A pirate boat nearby steals slaves from raided villages to trade. The malákas has no right to take what isn’t his! I want his boat cleared from the horizon."

Id: [0x00201BAC]
"There’s a pirate who always gets into a drunken brawl whenever he comes ashore. Sink that malákas’s boat and he’ll think twice about coming here again."

Id: [0x00201BAD]
"A pirate spat in my face as he came ashore and then laughed at me. Send that malákas’s ship to the sharks, and we’ll see who’s left laughing."

Id: [0x00201BAE]

"There’s an Athenian boat in the port, and I know for a fact that it’s crammed with deserters! Someone needs to stop those malákes before they escape!"

Id: [0x00201BB1]
"There’s a lone Athenian boat out on the horizon. I bet it’s a scout. Someone should sink it fast and show those Athenian dogs we’re not to be messed with."

Id: [0x00201BB2]
"Athenians took supplies from my shop and loaded them on a boat, saying they’re needed for the war effort. I’d rather see the lot at the bottom of the sea!"

Id: [0x00201BB3]
"I’ve seen an Athenian boat on the horizon. It makes the helots uneasy. Maybe they will revolt. I want that cursed boat wiped clean from sight."

Id: [0x00201BB4]
"One Athenian boat sails alone near the harbor. An easy way to crush the Athenian morale! I’ll reward anyone with the skills to sink the malákes!"

Id: [0x00201BB5]
"Are you fearless? Are you strong? Are you dedicated to Sparta? I have seen a lone Athenian boat near our shores! Take it down and protect our harbor!"

Id: [0x00201BB6]
"Cursed Athenians stole supplies off my ship for themselves! Now I have nothing to sell at port. Gut their boat and send the malákes to a watery grave."

Id: [0x00201BB7]
"Everyone knows I work hard all day at my forge. Athenians took my best weapons for their ship and didn’t drop a single drachma. Sink the malákes!"

Id: [0x00201BB8]
"One group of Athenian soldiers is rude and aggressive every time it comes ashore. Someone needs to teach the malákes a lesson. Start with their ship!"

Id: [0x00201BB9]
"My husband is due to set sail with some Athenian soldiers. I don’t want him to come back. All my drachmae to the one who makes sure that boat sinks deep."

Id: [0x00201BBA]
"Spartan deserters are hiding on a ship in the harbor. Those malákes cannot be allowed to escape! Have courage and sink these cowards!"

Id: [0x00201BBB]

Id: [0x00201BBC]
"Spartans bring trouble. I saw one of their boats in the harbor. Drachmae to the one who sinks it. Let the sea run red with Spartan blood!"

Id: [0x00201BBD]
"Spartans beat us, spit on us, hunt us for sport. Brothers and sisters, I say no more! Show these malákes we can beat them too by sinking a Spartan boat!"

Id: [0x00201BBE]
"Spartan spears are good spears. Wreck one of their ships, and I can go diving for their salvage. I’ll pay good drachmae for the chance!"

Id: [0x00201BBF]
"The Spartans think they’re better than us. Let’s see how far they get when their ship is on the seabed. Can the malákes walk on water? I think not!"

Id: [0x00201BC0]
"A lone Spartan ship circles near our shore. To all with courage, now is your chance to prove your worth to Athens. Let Spartan blood stain the sea!"

Id: [0x00201BC1]
"The sea provides great treasure, especially when nature has a little help. I promise great drachmae to the one who sinks a Spartan ship for me!"

Id: [0x00201BC2]
"Writing great tales of the war is hard when there are no battles to be seen. I’ll pay well to watch a brave warrior sink a Spartan ship below the waves!"

Id: [0x00201BC3]
"Victory to Athens, for I have foreseen that a Spartan ship is about to sink. Drachmae awaits the one who helps my prophecy come true!"

Id: [0x00201BC4]
"One merchant always sells the rarest herbs. It’s impossible to compete with this malákas. Drachmae to the one who sinks him and his herbs!"

Id: [0x00201BC5]
"There’s a merchant who overcharges everyone, and the guards do nothing about it. I want to see his ship sink. Then he’d know how it feels to have nothing."

Id: [0x00201BC6]
"A merchant in the port seems to think he can treat the rest of us like dirt. I see him harassing and insulting people. He’d be nothing without his ship."

Id: [0x00201BC7]
"One lousy malákas always has the best goods to sell at the port. I’d pay well to send his ship to the sharks!"

Id: [0x00201BC8]
"Twice I’ve bought terrible bread from a merchant claiming it to be the best. The malákas thinks he can trick me! I want to see his ship and his bread drown!"

Id: [0x00201BC9]
"A merchant in the port sells slaves and beats them badly. I can’t watch this anymore. Sink the bastard’s ship and make sure he can never trade again."

Id: [0x00201BCA]
"A merchant in the agora always shirks his tax. Why must the rest of us pay while he keeps his drachmae? Sink his ship and teach the malákas a lesson."

Id: [0x00201BCB]
"There’s a merchant who is always loud and drunk. He’s unbearable! Drachmae to the one who sinks the fool and brings some peace back to the port."

Id: [0x00201BCC]

Id: [0x00201BCD]
"There’s a merchant trying to make his goods sound better by lying about my wares. The malákas thinks I’m a fool! Destroy his ship and I’ll reward you."

"These pirates are out of control. They rob every boat, ship, even little fishing craft. I think they’d rob a dolphin. Sink these idiots."

Id: [0x00201C80]
"The Athenians have put too much pressure on the ports. Sink their ships and buy time for a counter offensive."

Id: [0x00201C81]
"These weak Athenians won’t fight us on land - they hide on their boats like cowards because they think we won’t come after them. Show them they are wrong."

Id: [0x00201C82]
"Sharks love to eat Athenians. Make the sharks happy, sink their boats."

"Athenian ships blot the horizon, but we are not defeated! Sink as many of their ships as you can and earn your glory!"

Id: [0x00201C88]
"These Spartans think they are sailors now? What does a Spartan know about ships? Sink their fleet and send them back to their landlocked little city."

Id: [0x00201C89]
"The Spartans can’t match us on the seas, but we’re under too much pressure in this port. Sink the Spartan ships and restore our power to the waves."

"Captains wanted to aid Athenian naval efforts. Sink Spartan ships for profit and glory!"

Id: [0x00201C8D]

"I have never seen a Spartan swim, have you? Sink all their boats and let’s see if they can swim in all that armor."

Id: [0x00201C93]
"There is a ring of merchants smuggling illegal goods into the port and undermining our local supplies. Let them sell their dirty wares to the sharks."

"The merchant ships in the port are smuggling weapons to the enemy. Sink every last one of them."

Id: [0x00201C95]

Typhon's Mace

Id: [0x00201EA7]
In our time, one misthios was feared above all. Forever present, forever undefeated, age would not dull his edge nor rust his hammer's head. Behind {FULLNAME} was a trail of desolation and the eerie silence of death.

Id: [0x00201EA8]
Griffin's Scythe

Id: [0x00201EA9]
When {NAME} came of age, she hoped her father would choose her to apprentice under him as a blacksmith, but he chose her brother instead. She stole the Griffin's Scythe from her father's shop and blessed it with her father's blood. Thus started her life as a mercenary.

Id: [0x00201EAA]
Achilles's Bow

Id: [0x00201EAB]
{NAME} of {BIRTHPLACE} built her reputation on murder, raining death from above with nearly invisible arrows. Many called her a coward for it, but few dared to, fearing a quick death from the silent sky.

Id: [0x00201EAC]
Perseus's Helmet

Id: [0x00201EAD]
When offered enough wine, {FULLNAME} would recount the tale of meeting Medusa. She immediately fled, though not before stealing a circlet as a trophy. She insisted it turned her invisible when worn, which, of course, no one saw.

Id: [0x00201EAE]
Jason's Golden Fleece

Id: [0x00201EAF]
{FULLNAME} was more than a strong demeanor and commanding, almost regal presence - some began to tell tales that she could withstand heavy blows that would cripple any man. But how?

Id: [0x00201EB0]
Bracers of Theseus

Id: [0x00201EB1]
{NAME} loved two things in life: to drink and to fight. He was never noted as a particularly talented warrior, but somehow always came out victorious. Many said the Fates blessed him. Others say it was something else…

Id: [0x00201EB2]
Hippolyta's Belt

Id: [0x00201EB3]
Raised in Chios amongst the Daughters of Artemis, {NAME} abandoned her kin by stealing Hippolyta’s Belt from her elders. What she didn’t know is that it would make her giddy with bloodlust, dooming her to a life of combat.

Atalanta's Sandals

Id: [0x00201EB5]
Living for the thrill of the hunt, {NAME} of {BIRTHPLACE} swore an oath to Atalanta never to marry if she could gain but a fraction of her speed. Her prayers were answered - her feet becoming a blur while she landed devastating attacks on her opponents.

Id: [0x00201EB6]
Hades's Bow

Id: [0x00201EB7]
Many witnessed {FULLNAME} in combat. Few survived. A rumor said that he was far more skilled with his flaming bow than with any sword, but none had gotten close enough - or wanted to - to find out.

Arachne's Stingers

{NAME} the Frigid

Id: [0x00201F9E]
{FULLNAME} was abandoned in the snow as a baby. Three days she spent alone in the cold until she was found by a woman. Despite {FULLNAME}’s traumatic origins, she became the killer she claimed the gods intended her to be.

Id: [0x00201FAD]
{NAME}, Hope Crusher

Id: [0x00201FAE]
His entire life, {FULLNAME} had been called pessimistic, but it was through his dark despair that he did so well. By always expecting the worst, he was ready for it.

Id: [0x00201FAF]
{NAME} of the Centaur

Id: [0x00201FB0]
Ever since his childhood in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} spent about as much time on a horse as on his own feet. It came as no surprise to anyone he faced that he grew to be adept at killing on horseback.

Id: [0x00201FB1]
{NAME} the Speechless

Id: [0x00201FB2]
Some believed that {FULLNAME} was never able to speak; others said he was so intelligent that he never found anything worth saying. It was believed by some that he did speak, but only when in battle. Whatever the case may have been, it worked in his favor.

Id: [0x00201FB3]
{NAME} the Vengeful

Id: [0x00201FB4]
One day, the pup {FULLNAME} raised from birth was taken. Whether it was killed or simply stolen, he planned to kill all who might have been responsible. In the end, he did what he set out to do. Unfortunately, he killed some very powerful men with some very powerful allies in the process.

Id: [0x00201FB5]
{NAME} the Soulless Walker

Id: [0x00201FB6]
{NAME} tended his fields peacefully alongside his beloved wife and children until bandits came and tore that life away from him, leaving him with burned crops and bloodied hands. Stories said his soul burst with sorrow, and he fled to the underworld, leaving his living corpse behind.

Id: [0x00201FB7]
{NAME} the Ever-Living

Id: [0x00201FB8]
While few have seen Thanatos and returned to tell about it, it’s said {FULLNAME} almost died over fifteen times prior to his actual death. His alleged immunity was seen as a challenge to many, and there were bets between other mercenaries on who would finally kill {NAME}.

Id: [0x00201FB9]
{NAME} the Mountain

Id: [0x00201FBA]
More mountain than human, {NAME} stood taller than the rest for as long as he could remember. He was able to take blows that would have killed other mercenaries. After each battle, he marked down any new wounds he received and the battle he fought in to receive them.

Id: [0x00201FBB]
{NAME} the One-Eyed

Id: [0x00201FBC]
When asked how {FULLNAME} lost his eye, the answer was apparently never the same. His mother extracted it with a fork. He was forced to wrestle a pack of dogs. To date, it is still unclear if even he knew the truth. Perhaps he told so many lies about it that he forgot the true answer.

Id: [0x00201FBD]
{NAME} the Room Clearer

Id: [0x00201FBE]

Id: [0x00201FBF]
{NAME} the Giant Slayer

Id: [0x00201FC0]
{FULLNAME} was the shortest among his brothers and sisters. Even when he became a mercenary, they called him Giant Slayer as an insult. Until he killed a man twice his size. Then it was a badge of honor.

Id: [0x00201FC1]
{NAME} the Glutton

Id: [0x00201FC2]
Coming from a life of plenty, {FULLNAME} grew fat. His appetites were insatiable: food, drink, sex - he wanted it all. Those dimwitted enough to refuse his desires always paid, and paid dearly.

Id: [0x00201FC3]
{NAME} the Tamed

Id: [0x00201FC4]
{FULLNAME} used to brawl with the most dangerous men he could find. But children and grandchildren have a way of softening one's edges. He became genial very quickly after that. Well, mostly.

{NAME} the Ironheart

Id: [0x00201FC6]

{NAME} the Sightless

Id: [0x00201FCC]

Id: [0x00201FCD]
{NAME}, Lover of Euterpe

Id: [0x00201FCE]
{FULLNAME} dedicated every victory to the muse of music and delight, Euterpe. He would play a song on his lute every day in hopes that she would descend from heaven to his bed. Unsurprisingly, {NAME} was never married.

Id: [0x00201FCF]
{NAME}, Master of Sharks

Id: [0x00201FD0]

Id: [0x00201FD1]
{NAME} the Tongue-Tied

Id: [0x00201FD2]
{FULLNAME} said not a word - on most days. Once referred to by a friend as “the Mute,” he grabbed the man by the throat, spitting, “Y-you dare n-n-not want me to sp-speak." It’s said not a single person called him mute ever again, and nobody dared commenting on how he spoke.

Id: [0x00201FD3]
{NAME} the Toad

{NAME} the Forsaken

Id: [0x00201FD6]
{FULLNAME} was a general of an elite band of soldiers. One fateful day, his orders resulted in the deaths of his entire unit, the absolute size of which garnered awe. {NAME} was the only one who walked away alive, and he vowed to never lead a single person again lest he kill them as well.

Id: [0x00201FD7]
{NAME} the Impotent

Id: [0x00201FD8]

{NAME} the Savage

Id: [0x00201FDA]
{FULLNAME} could rip apart anything - an arm from a torso and head from a neck - though he preferred to use his teeth. How he actually went about that, it's best not to find out.

Id: [0x00201FDB]
{NAME} the Merry

Id: [0x00201FDC]
{FULLNAME} loved his days as a blacksmith in {BIRTHPLACE}, singing through the barrage of fire and iron. He never lost that zeal, and was known for inspiring other mercenaries to enjoy their work as well.

Id: [0x00201FDD]
{NAME} the Compulsive

Id: [0x00201FDE]
{FULLNAME} was known for having rituals he refused to break lest he get the sinking feeling Hades himself would swallow him whole. Wake up. Shine his blade. Sink his blade into an unsuspecting victim. Shine his blade again. Repeat daily to keep his inner demons at bay.

{NAME} the Manic

Id: [0x00202400]
{FULLNAME} was never known to be rational. A sip of wine not to his taste or a summer breeze just a little too chill... No one knew what would set him off next. Over time, it’s said that people stopped talking to him altogether.

Id: [0x00202401]
{NAME} the Brash

Three-Thumbed {NAME}

Id: [0x00202408]
Contrary to popular belief, {FULLNAME} wasn’t born with his third thumb. Rather, he lost the tip of his index finger in a bar fight, and thus his third thumb was made. He claimed he could wield a sword better that way.

Id: [0x00202409]
{NAME} the Bloody Drizzle

Id: [0x0020240A]

{FULLNAME} was known for loving the theater. So much so that when he was a child, his parents believed he was destined to be an actor. However, he found a new way to perform as a mercenary. Killing was an art to him, and he intended to perfect it.

Id: [0x00202495]
{NAME} the Thrill Seeker

Id: [0x00202496]
{FULLNAME} could never resist walking the line between life and death. Some said he had been close enough to dying often enough that he grew familiar with the underworld. Some said he learned to no longer fear it.

Id: [0x00202497]
{NAME} the Poet

Id: [0x00202498]
{FULLNAME} was as much a killer as he was a wordsmith. He sometimes enacted poetic justice mid-fight, and his victims were treated to sweet-sounding banter as they met his blade.

Id: [0x00202499]
{NAME} the Painter

Id: [0x0020249A]
{FULLNAME} desperately sought training in the fine arts for most of his life. Rejected by almost every mentor for his lack of talent, he turned his back on his passion and took up mercenary work. He still found time to paint, using his victim’s blood and their bodies as a canvas.

Id: [0x0020249B]
Four-Toed {NAME}

Id: [0x0020249C]
Rumors said {FULLNAME} was hung by his toes for crimes of blurred detail. The crimes were so petty, he was forgotten about and hung until most of his toes fell off. He claimed fewer toes made for quieter footsteps.

Id: [0x002025BB]
{NAME} the Recluse

Id: [0x002025BC]
Few met {FULLNAME}, and those who had only caught a glimpse. This mercenary lived in the shadows of society, striking his targets silently and leaving before anyone knew he was there.

Id: [0x002025BD]
{NAME} the Vigilant

Id: [0x002025BE]
{FULLNAME} knew to watch the skies. Spotting arrows from a mile away started rumors that the gods made him invulnerable to them.

Id: [0x002025BF]
{NAME} the Panicked

Id: [0x002025C0]
Those who underestimated {FULLNAME} didn’t live much longer. He never ran from his fears but charged them head on with a manic energy most learned to fear.

Id: [0x002025C1]
{NAME} the Scorned

Id: [0x002025C2]
{FULLNAME} was known to fight with an anger unmatched by most. Many said there was only one explanation why the fire within him burned so ferociously: love for a woman not returned.

Id: [0x002025C3]
{NAME}, Goat Hunter

Id: [0x002025C4]
{FULLNAME} claimed to have shot Aigipan in the forest many years ago. It’s said the arrow barely grazed Aigipan’s ankle before he escaped. {NAME} never saw him again, but many said he was still haunted by that day.

{NAME} the Lion Born

Id: [0x0020289A]
Feral and vicious, many said {NAME} was raised by lions. They claim she exhibited strange tendencies, especially relating to where she slept and how she ate. A lover of raw meat, her mouth was often dyed red with the blood of the animals she killed.

Id: [0x0020289B]
{NAME} the Poison Drinker

Id: [0x0020289C]
After many years of slowly exposing herself to toxins, {FULLNAME}’s favorite party trick was to drink poison and live. It’s said those who didn’t watch their drink around her would be found dead later on, empty cup nearby.

{NAME} the Celestial Paramour

Id: [0x00226568]
All her life, {FULLNAME} lived to perfect the art of flirtation. However, her divine charms paired with a deep disinterest in commitment led to an occasional tavern fight between jealous suitors. Out of necessity, honing her dexterity with weapons became her second passion.

Id: [0x002265D2]
In September of 480 BCE, King Leonidas of Sparta and Themistokles of Athens led a Greek force against the Persian army of Xerxes I.

{NAME} the Beautiful

Id: [0x00226640]
Many told {FULLNAME} that she was too pretty to be a warrior. That a woman who looked like her would be better off finding a rich husband and living a life of luxury. It’s said she always responded with a smile as she drove her sword straight through their stomach and out their back.

Id: [0x00226655]
{NAME} the Repulsive

Id: [0x00226656]
{FULLNAME} was born so deeply ugly that not even her parents could bear to look at her. When she was a young girl, the other children ran away screaming at her approach. She vowed to one day give all who belittled her a true reason to scream. She kept that promise.

Id: [0x00226657]
{NAME} the Sustainer of Empusa

Id: [0x00226658]
According to legend, {FULLNAME} pledged herself long ago to a fearsome monster in exchange for a favor from Hekate herself. No one knew what the favor was, but everyone knew the cost. {FULLNAME} spent her days seducing young men and bringing their bloody corpses to sustain the shapeshifting monster.

Id: [0x00226659]
{NAME} the Furious

Id: [0x0022665A]
Visited by infernal goddesses in the night as a girl, {FULLNAME} was possessed by a deep inexplicable rage her entire life. It was only through becoming a deadly mercenary that she finally found an outlet for the flames within her. If you ask me, she simply made up an excuse for her anger.

Id: [0x0022665B]
{NAME} the Drunkard

Id: [0x0022665C]
It’s said {FULLNAME} could drink Dionysos himself under the table. Known for her love of festivals and celebration, she was the life of every party. Those who got her angry after a few bottles of wine learned quickly that she was also able to throw a punch with ungodly force.

Id: [0x0022665D]
{NAME} the Flesh-Eater

Id: [0x0022665E]
{FULLNAME}’s title was about as clear cut as it could get. Simply and delicately put, she feasted on the corpses of her victims for dinner and saved their eyeballs for dessert. Or so the stories go…

Id: [0x0022665F]
{NAME} the Cackler

Id: [0x00226660]
The last sound {FULLNAME}’s victims heard before they died was her laughter. Those who watched from a distance said her laugh was soft at first: small giggles, slowly rising in loudness before they burst into a maddening howl.

Id: [0x00226661]
Fair-Weathered {NAME}

Id: [0x00226662]
Though skilled in a fight, {FULLNAME}’s true talent had always been knowing when to run. She could hold her own in a battle of blades, but once things heated up, she would often disappear.

Id: [0x00226663]
{NAME} the Dancer

Id: [0x00226664]
Everyone knows that in a swordfight, the first person to misstep takes a hit. {FULLNAME} never missed her step.

Id: [0x00226665]
{NAME} the Redeemer

Id: [0x00226666]
Early in her career as a debt collector, {FULLNAME} realized that loan borrowers and debt payers were rarely one and the same. That is, until she began to play a more forceful hand.

Id: [0x00226667]
{NAME} the Deaf

Id: [0x00226668]
Because she was born without her hearing, there were many attempts on {FULLNAME}’s life by those who thought she didn’t deserve to live. She grew up knowing that, at any moment, a killer may sneak up on her from behind, so she learned to stab from the front before they ever got the chance.

Id: [0x00226669]
{NAME} the Cursed

Id: [0x0022666A]
Long ago, {FULLNAME} sold what many claimed to be the most effective love philters in the world. Her spells were so sought after, she quickly rose to wealth and affluence. But upon reaching the upper tiers of society filled with politicians and economists, she found curses to be far more useful.

Id: [0x0022666B]
{NAME} the Devoted

Id: [0x0022666C]
{NAME} was known across the lands for her deep and unmovable loyalty. Not to friends or family, of course, but to her marks. Once the Devoted was given a target, she never rested until they were dead.

Id: [0x0022666D]
{NAME}, Lover of Hades

Id: [0x0022666E]
{FULLNAME} killed in great numbers and asked for nothing in return. She wasn’t pledged to Sparta or Athens and wasn’t tied down to mercenary contracts. No one knows for sure how she chose her victims. Some said she had bound herself to Hades and spent her days collecting souls for him.

Id: [0x0022666F]
{NAME} the Speckled

Id: [0x00226670]
Dropped in hot water as baby in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} had a rough start in life. Though her skin was mottled, she was known as one of the most feared mercenaries. Some said they even saw her walk through flames without flinching.

Id: [0x00226671]
Screaming {NAME}

Id: [0x00226672]
Not known for subtlety in her attacks, {FULLNAME} launched herself at her foes and howled with all her strength. Everyone saw her coming, but few got away.

Id: [0x00226673]
{NAME} the Enduring

Id: [0x00226674]
If you can name a hardship, {FULLNAME} dealt with it. Poverty, grief, war, torture. She saw it all and endured it endlessly. Years of pain were stored inside her, begging to be released on her enemies.

Id: [0x00226675]
{NAME} the Hopeless

Id: [0x00226676]
Legend has it that {FULLNAME} fell in love with a swan, believing it to be Zeus in disguise. She spent years praying that one day Zeus would reveal himself, but that day never came. When the swan died, {FULLNAME} was possessed with a despair that scorched her soul raw.

Id: [0x00226677]
{NAME} the Scorned Muse

Id: [0x00226678]
Said to be a tenth muse fallen from the grace of Zeus, {FULLNAME}’s face was almost always contorted with a latent rage. Anyone who dared to cross her saw it unleashed.

Id: [0x00226679]
{NAME} the Siren

Id: [0x0022667A]
I’ve found stories of a woman who sang for drachmae at the side of a road. It’s said anyone who stopped to listen was quickly gutted and robbed. Once people heard the stories, she would move to a new road where fresh, unsuspecting victims were. The people say {FULLNAME} was this woman.

Id: [0x0022667B]
{NAME} the Absurd

Id: [0x0022667C]
Few were as raucous or as funny as {FULLNAME}. Thought to be capable of making Zeus himself crack a smile, she never left a room without leaving all its occupants in tears. It’s said while they were laughing, she would find her mark and poison their cup.

Id: [0x0022667F]
{NAME} the Wealthy

Id: [0x00226680]
{FULLNAME} grew up in a beautiful home in {BIRTHPLACE} as daughter to a statesman. She was provided with everything she could ever ask for. Her head start in life left her one of the most cunning mercenaries in the world.

Id: [0x00226681]
{NAME} the Clay-Fingered

Id: [0x00226682]
{FULLNAME} created what many said were the most beautiful sculptures in {BIRTHPLACE}. Her work was lifelike and haunting, and little did anyone know that she preserved the corpses of her victims in the clay. It was the only way to perfectly capture their faces of fear.

Id: [0x00226683]
Greasy {NAME}

Id: [0x00226684]
There were few better connected than {FULLNAME}. She didn’t waste time communing with the upper echelons of society, but honed in on collecting contacts among the poorest within the cities. With enough friends in low places, she had eyes everywhere.

Id: [0x00226685]
{NAME} the Colossus

Id: [0x00226686]
Her nickname just about says it all. There were few taller, braver, or stronger than {FULLNAME}. Many tried to contest her strength. None succeeded.

Id: [0x00226687]
{NAME}, Mother of Spiders

Id: [0x00226688]
As a young girl in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} spent 3 days trapped in a well. Alone save for a few spiders, she outgrew her fear. She escaped the well, and became what her early misfortune had designed her to be. It’s said she killed using a poison brewed from the venom of her eight-legged friends.

Id: [0x00226689]
{NAME} the Dead Wedded

Id: [0x0022668A]
After a fire, {NAME}’s husband became a shell of his former self. He sought only vengeance for the death of his children. {FULLNAME}, however, moved on from her grief and found joy in life’s simple pleasures. Like the air of the open road - or the sound of her enemies’ screams as she killed them.

Id: [0x0022668B]
{NAME} the Crow

Id: [0x0022668C]
A scavenger at heart, it’s not hard to guess how {FULLNAME} got her nickname. She made her wealth not by jumping into a fight, but by circling it from a distance until the killing blow had been struck. With the threat removed, she materialized to rob the body before it could even begin to grow cold.

Id: [0x0022668D]
{NAME} the Lyrist

Id: [0x0022668E]
{FULLNAME} was known for her music ever since she learned to play in {BIRTHPLACE}. Entertaining affluent politicians at festivals, she learned to play people with almost as much skill as she played the lyre.

Id: [0x0022668F]
{NAME} the Vulgar

Id: [0x00226690]
{FULLNAME} was a poet in her own right. Those who met her blade were treated to a cacophony of slurs and oddities right before they died.

Id: [0x0022669B]
{NAME} the Impervious

Id: [0x0022669C]
Some said {FULLNAME} was immune to arrows. There was never an explanation for how she could somehow walk through fire, and how she never tired in a battle. It almost seems like she created stories to spread fear or to prevent her enemies from attacking her in certain ways.

Kleon

Id: [0x00227863]
Kleon made his fortune in anonymity until Kosmos called on him - Perikles was refusing to go to war, and peace would be profitable for no one. The Cult commanded Kleon to rile the masses, and force Perikles into battle. Despite Kleon's extreme efforts, he failed. Left with no alternative, Kleon took matters into his own hands and began his bloody, violent ascent to power.

Id: [0x00227864]
Iokaste the Seer

Id: [0x00227869]
Iokaste the Seer, the Gods' Breath, the Mystic Sage, held the world by its heart. It was Iokaste who fed the Oracle of Delphi her lies to tell. It was Iokaste who instructed Chrysis to abduct Deimos and raise the child as her own. Iokaste perverted every prayer, every religious rite, turning every act of worship into an offering for Kosmos.

Id: [0x00227874]
Nyx the Shadow

Id: [0x00227875]
The Eyes saw all, but were lead by a woman few had ever seen. As one would expect, "Nyx" was only one of countless names worn by The Shadow. With these came entire personalities, lives, and histories. The Cult needed a nobody, a faceless agent who could be anywhere, and The Shadow was that agent.

Id: [0x0022787E]
Exekias the Legend

Id: [0x00227880]
Exekias the Legend fought under no one's banner, and so was able to go where no soldier or hero could. This afforded the Cult great flexibility: where there was struggle against their will, Exekias would appear, as if by coincidence. He drank and celebrated and sang songs with those who opposed Kosmos's will. And then, when the celebration settled, those people were never seen again.

Id: [0x00227882]
The Hydra

Id: [0x00227883]
Hydra the Many-Headed caught the eye of Kosmos through sheer viciousness. Recruited to be a simple ship's captain, the young Hydra instead took command, slaughtering and sinking any who opposed. He united the Cult's fleets and its so-called "gods" of the Aegean, until those sailors who knew them knew to fear them more than Poseidon's wrathful tempests. This fear was Hydra's gift to Kosmos.

The Cultist King of Sparta had infiltrated the highest position in the Peloponnese, and from that position the Cult sank these lands into war. Not since the Persian invasion had such suffering been felt, and yet the people loved him for it. This was his true power: with the Cult's support, he could send troops marching to Athens's walls, painting the world red, and the people would sing his praise.

Id: [0x00227886]
Polemon the Wise

Id: [0x00227887]
Life's greatest tragedy was that one could know the world and do nothing to change it… A rule that applied to all but Polemon. The Wise was the true architect of the war between the Delians and the Peloponnese. The Cult's reason for the war was simple: control through chaos. Polemon's was simpler: he wanted wealth and would stoke the fires of this war until every Greek son had died in battle.

Id: [0x0022788C]
Aspasia

Id: [0x0022788D]
Aspasia, daughter of the mighty Axiochos of Miletos, came to wealth and power in the most unlikely of ways: by falling in love. But even having dominion over Perikles and the hearts and minds of all Athenians would not be enough. Her ambition demanded more. To know all. To rule all. Anything less would not be good enough.

Id: [0x00227897]
Aside from profiting from both sides of the war, Elpenor served Kosmos in one way - destroying the chosen's bloodline. He did, after all, find Deimos's sibling on the dusty roads of Kephallonia, and rumors quickly spread that he was the mastermind behind what happened to the Wolf in Megaris.  For a time, it seemed he'd accounted for everything and was unstoppable.

Id: [0x002278A0]
The Master

Id: [0x002278A1]
There were those among us who had no sense of what was right or good. Take the man known only as The Master - a horrifying abomination in the shape of a man. He did not oversee his quarry or slave trade for financial wealth, but for the wealth of information that could be used by the Cult. Every merchant who traveled to him brought truth he could use and left with the lies he chose for them to believe.

Id: [0x002278A6]
Sotera

Id: [0x002278A7]
Sotera's many eyes saw all. Idle sailors trolling the sea, beggars meekly begging for coin - all might've been her agents. And all were deadly. Through this network, there was hardly a conversation that went unheard by her ears, or an opportunity that went unseen by her eyes.

Id: [0x002278A8]
Midas

Id: [0x002278A9]
The Cult sought out what was old, looting tombs and ruins like petty grave robbers. Few knew what they were looking for. With the looting done, they tasked Midas of Argos with destroying all traces of these ancient sites from history. By day, he was known simply as a wealthy, if ruthless, banker. By night, everything Midas touched turned to fire.

Id: [0x002278AE]
Hermippos

Id: [0x002278AF]
Hermippos, son of Lysis and brother to Myrtilos, sought to undermine Athens's fragile democracy at every turn. He was a vile, impetuous man, using the theater to accuse Perikles of cowardice, and to coerce Athenian voters to demand war. Secretly, he was much the same, working from the shadows to force Athens to fight Sparta head on.

Id: [0x002278B8]
Peloponnesian League

Id: [0x002278BB]
Skylax

Id: [0x002278BC]
Skylax knew what others in the Peloponnesian League did not: where force failed, drachmae always won. In this way, with a massive fortune at his disposal, Skylax bribed the weaker puppet leaders in the League. For this service, Skylax prayed to Kosmos to return his lost children and wife to him. It was a prayer that would go unanswered.

Id: [0x002278BD]
Silanos

Id: [0x002278BE]
For ages, Silanos searched out the origins of the bloodline, until he found it - Myrrine was ruling Naxos. As a gift for his discovery, the Cult "disposed" of the leader of Paros, Naxos's sister island, and gifted it to Silanos. To avoid suspicion, Silanos posed as an Athenian polemarch, plotting his next move: one day, he'd have Myrrine's island, and her head.

Id: [0x002278BF]
The Monger

Id: [0x002278C0]
One did not need to see the Monger in the streets of Korinth to feel him there. His brutes had taken over. The city, once the richest and most prosperous port in all the Greek world, now wallowed in corruption. The Cult would use this thug, with a small mind and a firm grip, to do their bidding.

Id: [0x002278C6]
Kallias

Id: [0x002278C7]
Kallias grew to be a formidable Olympic champion, and from then, his victories became legendary. All in Olympia who knew him, loved him. None would have suspected he'd tamper with the Olympic results. No one but the Cult.

Id: [0x002278C8]
Lagos

Id: [0x002278C9]
This war made nations wealthy overnight, including Arkadia. Its grain fields kept Sparta's armies fed, making it a ripe target for the Cult. But Lagos, Arkadia's benevolent figurehead, was no ordinary Cultist. He longed for a world of peace in which he could raise his family... until his family disappeared from his home. He became a puppet leader, hoping obedience would return them to him safely.

Id: [0x002278CE]
Delian League

Id: [0x002278D4]
Brison

Id: [0x002278D5]
As was always the case with young men who were too pretty, too rich, or both, Brison lived as a weakling easily exploited by others. In the Cult, he saw an opportunity to change all that. He would be strong, feared, and respected. In exchange, his pledge to Kosmos was this: he would torture and kill every person who stood against the Cult.

Id: [0x002278D7]
After generations of control and dominance, the Silver Islands' influence waned. Perikles led Athens to become a center of power. This was a change Podarkes the Cruel would not tolerate. The Cult gifted him a formidable army. With it, he would squash the brewing Delian rebellion, and pledge to the Cult to burn Athens to the ground.

Id: [0x002278E0]
Kodros

Id: [0x002278E1]
A crueler little man than Kodros of Lesbos, there was none. Having been a fighter himself, he knew to stock his forces with prize fighters from the arenas and pits. Their glory would be his. Though he marched them out under the Delian League's banners, and though they were feared, none knew he offered their lives in battle as sacrifice to Kosmos.

Id: [0x002278E2]
Iobates

Id: [0x002278E3]
Calculating and mysterious, everywhere and nowhere, none were as feared as Iobates of Lemnos and the bloodthirsty mercenaries fighting in his name. Under his careful planning, these rogues become a force for terror and oppression across the lands, and as mercenaries knew no borders, he was able to attack where other soldiers simply could not.

Id: [0x002278E4]
Rhexenor the Hand

Id: [0x002278E5]
From a sudden swing in a vote to go to war to a stubborn politician found dead in the streets, the scars the Cult left on democracy became unmistakable and feared by all. Those were the scars. Rhexenor was the blade. No matter how resilient Athenians were, his subtle hand would always usher their votes back to war, and to serve Kosmos's will.

Id: [0x002278F5]
The Chimera

Id: [0x002278F6]
Where some knew passion, or love, or warmth, The Chimera knew only cold calculation. The world was hers to exploit, and exploit it she did in the name of Kosmos. Her next target would be the artifacts hidden away in an ancient forge. Her slaves would unlock its hidden secrets, or face her wrath.

Id: [0x00227944]
The Silver Griffin

Id: [0x00227945]
Under Kosmos there was a unique man known now as The Silver Griffin. Unique not for his cruelty, but for his ability to make others carry out his cruel will. Those who knew him said he considered himself a teacher, of all things. He taught control to slavers, and to slaves, he taught submission. His tool in both classes was the same - the fear of death.

Id: [0x00227946]
The Centaur of Euboea

Id: [0x00227947]
The Centaur of Euboea pledged to Kosmos the wealth amassed from his copper trade. To trade in copper, however, one needed slaves. Many slaves. And so the Cult sent the ships of lost souls to his mines... and to their doom.

Id: [0x00227948]
Epiktetos the Forthcoming

Id: [0x00227949]
Epiktetos the Forthcoming's ship building taught him one lesson, if no other: waging a war is always more profitable than winning one. He stood to make a fortune from the tragedies of war… until Deimos made a bloody, horrifying example out of him at the Cult's mysterious gathering.

Id: [0x0022794D]
Machaon the Feared

Id: [0x0022794E]
Machaon the Feared started simply enough - he sacrificed his wealth to Kosmos, but the god did not listen to Machaon's prayers. On a dark night, he sacrificed his only child. Then his servants. Nothing. So now, Machaon aimed to sacrifice all the Greek world. Kosmos would not be listening. A cunning spy in his midst, however, would be.

Worshippers of the Bloodline

Id: [0x00227955]
Chrysis

Id: [0x00227956]
In Chrysis's bedchamber was written "Hera's abomination." Although thought to be the writing of an angry worshipper, some say Chrysis wrote it herself, as a reminder of her role in serving Kosmos. She spent a lifetime abducting children, and raising them to be servants of the horrid Cult. A part of her did love those children once, though that part died long ago.

Id: [0x0022795B]
Harpalos

Id: [0x0022795C]
In those dark days, none were safe from Kosmos's reach, even other cults. The Followers of Ares had become intoxicated by Harpalos's passionate preaching. He promised them blood and flesh to eat. In return, they would be his army of monsters.

Id: [0x0022795E]
Diona

Id: [0x0022795F]
There was a certain seductive demeanor to Diona of Kythera. She was admired by all, or so the people said. And yet, something dark hid behind her inviting eyes and coy grin. With careful plotting, allies turned into enemies, and calm into chaos, if it suited the Cult's whims.

Id: [0x0022796E]
Melite

Id: [0x0022796F]
The Cultists' many goals allowed some to hide their true motivations. So it was with Melite, the cunning young Cultist who called no one place home. His teams of servants scoured the earth in search of the origins of Deimos's bloodline. That much was known. What he hid was that he intended to find the source and use it to harness the powers of the gods themselves.

Id: [0x00227970]
Zoisme

Id: [0x00227971]
What was known of Zoisme the Mad was only legend, told among the peasants and drunkards of Phokis. One went that she tied priests who opposed her to trees, then left them to be fed upon by her wolves. Another said that she slept in the dens of bears, emerging only to snatch pilgrims to the Oracle for supper. All these were sacrifices to Kosmos, whose appetite for flesh was never sated.

The Chosen One's Story

Id: [0x00227974]
Deimos

Id: [0x00227975]
A god. A warrior. A hero for Kosmos. This was the image Deimos conveyed. Yet, behind the heroism was an aching pain from a lifetime of suffering. Flung from the cliffs of Mount Taygetos, raised and tortured by the Cult, forced to fight or die, the humanity in Deimos had died long ago. What remained was a weapon. A glorious, deadly weapon that even the Cult could not control.

Id: [0x00227976]
Gods of the Aegean Sea

Asterion

Id: [0x00227979]
After Asterion lost his parents to the Persian invasion, his wife to a tempest, his children, his friends, his shipmates... he no longer sailed for a love of the sea, but a desire to avenge their deaths. But how many dead were left to float in Asterion's wake? Hundreds? Thousands? And when would those dead rise up, avenge themselves, and pull him down to sleep with those he loved?

Id: [0x0022797A]
Sokos

Id: [0x0022797B]
Youthful and brash, Sokos was a remarkable young man. He commanded respect. Yet the self-proclaimed Protector of the Obsidian Islands sailed for one reason alone - to earn glory in the eyes of Kosmos. Any who stood in the way of the Cult's ambitions found themselves in Sokos's wake, sinking to the bottom of the sea.

Id: [0x0022797C]
The Octopus

Id: [0x0022797D]
All that was known of her was myth. Sailors told the tale of a captain killed by Erinyes and resurrected as an apparition known only as The Octopus. She commanded the elite guard of the Cult with a heavy hand and a mighty devotion.

Id: [0x0022797E]
Melanthos

Id: [0x0022797F]
Young men of any nation were united in one way: they were driven by two goals. The first, to outlive their fathers. The second, to surpass them. Melanthos sought to achieve these goals at any cost, even if it meant sacrificing his own life for Kosmos. Of course, his preference was to sacrifice the lives of others.

Id: [0x00227980]
The Mytilenian Shark

Id: [0x00227981]
The Cult demanded many things, but mostly it demanded secrecy. To hide its deeds away, The Mytilenian Shark went to any length. Lucky for him that a great many things - weapons, writings, even the bodies of enemies - could be erased from history by hiding them at the bottom of the sea.

Letter from Thaletas

Id: [0x00227995]
My kings, we reached the shores of Delos Islands. But not without casualties. Mykonos Fort was in sight when Athenians sunk our ship. My grandpater's deeds at Thermopylai live on in memory alone, for his helmet now rests at the bottom of the sea. The men are in high spirits. I will not return until I've claimed these islands for Sparta. - Thaletas

Heroes of the Cult

Id: [0x0022799E]
Okytos the Great

Id: [0x0022799F]
Brutal, brutish, horrible - these were the kindest words ever used to describe Okytos the Great. The truth was that he was much, much worse. How fitting, then, that he was tasked with training young mercenaries to become guards and soldiers for Kosmos. Those who did not meet his standards in baseness made fine sacrifices instead.

Id: [0x002279A0]
Swordfish

Id: [0x002279A1]
A tale goes that the one known as Swordfish drank wine from the same cup, the hollowed out skull of his first sacrifice to Kosmos… the skull of his father. But time wore on the man as time wears on us all. After a life of malice, he sought to free himself of the Cult. He refused to meet them in Delphi, and never bowed to the one known as Deimos. Old habits, however dark, would prove hard to break.

Id: [0x002279A4]
Belos the Beast of Sparta

Id: [0x002279A5]
Sailing toward the shores of Pephka, screams could be heard. Softly at first, then louder. Then deafening. These were the sounds of men and women gasping for their last breaths in the fighting pits, before the Beast snuffed them out. His endless training in the name of Kosmos rendered him bored, but he couldn't know that a real challenger would soon meet him there and finish his reign as champion.

Id: [0x002279A6]
Pallas the Silencer

Id: [0x002279A7]
Pallas served the Cult only to feed his lust for carnage. They called him the Silencer as a heinous joke - on the battlefield he brought cries of pain, of fear, of madness, of death. And when the battle was won, only Pallas's guttural laughter could be heard.

Id: [0x002279A8]

In their time, the Champions of Boeotia inspired people across the nation. Songs were sung in their name. Now, the Champions were abominations who frightened and terrorized any who opposed them - even Boeotia's own people. At the center of that terror stood Deianeira, the fiercest fighter Kosmos had ever known. So long as she fought, Boeotia would stand.

It's safe, cheap, and the mongrels even put on a show! Or take after Blueblood I. and hire a good mercenary. Might be more expensive, but trust me, it's almost fun watching them die in battle for drachmae. If our Sage had a son marching on the battlefield, he wouldn't be so quick to send us to war. <LF>Glory to the League. <LF>K.

Octopus, <LF>My father's sending ships to join you in Anaphi - no reinforcements will reach Pephka. You have my word. My father has only one request… an answer to a question. Our Sage was last seen sailing west, and sailing alone. If anyone understands him, you do. Where is he going? And why? 
<LF>e are the waves. <LF>M.

Pater, <LF>We sunk a small fleet last night. Fire, blood in the water, glory. Then I saw it - fear and awe in my sailors' eyes. They are actually afraid of me. I finally understand, pater. Fear is control. You were right. One day, I will be the leader Messara, and the Messarans will know true fear. But first, I'm sailing west. We have enemies in these waters, and I intend to give you a gift... their heads.<LF>Melanthos

They were of no use now.   <LF>Forever, blood will last.

B.,<LF>Your whimpering at the hands of the brutish Redblood M. was echoing in all corners of our shrine... Save that pain. Remember it. Let it fester. In my lands, rebellion brews.

The democracy will die, and I will rule again.<LF>Glory to the League.<LF>P.

Kassandra uncovered a Clue in the wreckage of a sunken ship named the Shark's Head. Someone named the Mytilenian Shark was its captain. There was something more - a crest of a yellow-eyed snarling beast, the symbol of the Southern Sporades. Kassandra knew this is where she'd find her target.

If they find me, they'll find you, and I can't risk your life.

The other child of the bloodline has returned from the dead. Go to them and do as we've shown you. Bring them pain but never death; death of the bloodline is for Kosmos to give, and no one else.

If you can convince the people of your city to massacre the Mytilenians, Kosmos will grant you infinite power.

{NAME} the Stone Heart

Id: [0x0022F3BE]
As an infant in {BIRTHPLACE}, {NAME} was the sole survivor of a bandit raid on her village. Her rescuers said she neither cried nor laughed. Since that day, there wasn’t a person who claimed to ever see her do either.

Id: [0x0022F3BF]
{NAME} the Snake's Fang

Id: [0x0022F3C0]
No one saw {FULLNAME} before she attacked. She struck swiftly and disappeared before her rival's head had hit the ground.

Id: [0x0022F3C1]
{NAME} the Marble Fist

Id: [0x0022F3C2]
{NAME}'s beauty made her a favorite subject of sculptors in Athens. After dealing with artists for so long, she discovered she could make more drachmae with her fists.

Id: [0x0022F3C3]
{NAME} the Wrath of Persephone

Id: [0x0022F3C4]
{NAME} called herself Hades's beloved and believed she'd earn his favor by slitting throats. She delivered hundreds of subjects to his underworld kingdom, always claiming it was all for him.

Id: [0x0022F3C5]
{NAME} the Ebon Serpent

Id: [0x0022F3C6]
{FULLNAME} was not the most successful mercenary, often getting entangled in schemes she couldn’t control. She attempted to strike out on her own and change her fate, but she ultimately succumbed to what the gods truly had in store for her.

Id: [0x0022F3C7]
{NAME} the Mad Mistress

Id: [0x0022F3C8]
When {NAME} chose a target, it may have been for drachmae or glory. It may also have been because they refused to pay tribute to her goat-headed guide, Pan. Whatever the reason, she never hesitated to strike them down and allow her pet to feed on their corpse.

Id: [0x0022F3C9]
{NAME} the Angler

Id: [0x0022F3CA]
{FULLNAME}'s patience was renowned. She would wait all day and night to catch her foe unaware. In one story, it’s said she hid in shallow water all night - only the smallest part of her face visible above the waves. It was that night and many others like it that she got her kill.

Id: [0x0022F3CB]
{NAME} the Backbreaker

Id: [0x0022F3CC]
{NAME} took marks twice her size with the fearlessness of a charging bull. She left a trail of broken bodies in her wake.

Id: [0x0022F3CE]
{NAME} the Wreath of Roses

Id: [0x0022F3CF]
Foes often smelled {NAME}'s sweet perfume before they saw her. She dispatched enemies neatly and with a smile.

Id: [0x0022F3D6]
{NAME} the Questioner

Id: [0x0022F3D7]
Growing up in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} learned quickly that information was king. In her life as a mercenary, it’s said she preferred to ask questions, only making direct statements in combat. Often, she used the information she had gained about her enemy from others in order to ruin their focus.

Id: [0x0022F3D8]
{NAME} the Northerner

Id: [0x0022F3D9]
No one was exactly sure where {NAME} came from, as no proof exists. People claimed it must have been somewhere cold because nobody as harsh as her could have lived somewhere nice. The only affection she ever showed was to her pet lynx.

{NAME} the Cedar

Id: [0x0022F3E2]
{FULLNAME} got her nickname from her former profession. She cut down her enemies with as much sympathy as she offered the trees she felled as a woodcutter.

Id: [0x0022F3E5]
{NAME} the Flint

Id: [0x0022F3E6]
{FULLNAME} enjoyed playing with fire. She channeled her destructive impulses into mercenary work. Businesses, ships, rivals… none could escape her flames. There are stories that if you were captured by {NAME}, there was a good chance your final moments would be very hot.

Id: [0x0022F3E7]
{NAME} the Bow Blocker

Id: [0x0022F3E8]
The nimble {NAME} was once picked for the Heraia Games. Since then, she found that mercenary work was far more profitable.

Id: [0x0022F3E9]
{NAME} the Eye Gouger

Id: [0x0022F3EA]
{NAME} carried out her work with remarkable cruelty and with no patience for pleas of mercy. Those who got away from her alive were never the same. It’s not known whether she let them go or they escaped, but most believe it was the former. What better way to sow fear than to show your handiwork?

Id: [0x0022F3EB]
{NAME}, Daughter of Nyx

Id: [0x0022F3EC]
Few claimed to have seen {NAME} at work. She arrived as silently as nightfall and left no trace of her passage. You’d think these would be common traits among mercenaries, but you’d be surprised.

Id: [0x0022F3ED]
{NAME}, Wife of Hypnos

Id: [0x0022F3EE]
Hemlock, nightshade, and snake venom were apparently all ingredients in {NAME}'s special drink. Those who wouldn’t drink what she offered them received her blade instead.

Id: [0x0022F3EF]
{NAME} the Swift Paw

Id: [0x0022F3F0]
No one was sure if {FULLNAME} referred to the woman or to her pet leopard. Both were similarly deadly and neither could resist a challenge. Information has been uncovered that suggests she named the leopard after herself.

Id: [0x0022F3F1]
{NAME} the Howling Terror

Id: [0x0022F3F2]
{FULLNAME} and her wolf amassed a tally of victims that would impress even Thanatos. Some said he had a special hall set aside for both of them.

Id: [0x0022F3F5]
{NAME} the Sea Witch

Id: [0x0022F3F6]
Thalassa herself blessed {NAME} with her fury. A former pirate, {NAME} carried out contracts on land and at sea. When she tired of one, she often would head to the other, preferring to stay on the move than stay in one place where people could find her.

Sunken Wreck of Datis

Id: [0x0022F675]

It’s said {FULLNAME} was known for making delicious bread, but the war made resources hard to find, forcing him to raise prices. As customers dwindled, he knew he had to change his recipe. It’s said the final bite may have had a vague almond flavor, the last thing buyers ever tasted.

A great rift is dividing the people of Athens. Soon that rift must be healed. The world will fall under one rule - ours. Your many eyes must look within those city walls and snuff out those who would seek to oppose our rule. Let Athens be an example for the world. Share nothing you see with the Cult. What your eyes see, what your ears here, is for me alone to know. Kosmos does not just command it, he demands it.

Id: [0x00230E75]
Rhexenor,<LF>Enough incompetence - deal with Aristophanes or I'll chop off his head, then I'll chop off yours. He mocks me in his plays. Me! At a time when we need the masses afraid of Sparta, when we need them angry, he's writing comedies. Make the laughing fool cry. I'll help you one last time - I know one of Aristophanes's actors is enamored with some girl he's calling his muse. Find her.<LF>Glory to the League.<LF>K.

Id: [0x00230E76]
Kodros,<LF>I've been paying attention to your means of recruitment, and I must say they are most excellent. Arena champions make cheap labor, it distracts the people with bloody entertainment, and their heroes become our heroes as well. We live in an era where the common people's voice can break a ruler. Having them believe you're one of them can make an ally of any fool. <LF>Glory to the League.<LF>K.

Id: [0x00230E77]
Iobates,<LF>Our ranks swell as the world's greatest warriors join our cause, and I understand I have you to thank. They may not all adhere to the faith, but I always prefer soldiers who are motivated by simple pleasures, like money and standing. In a world of chaos, where free-thinking philosophers and artists are treated as kings, I have no need for troops who think for themselves. Those who do, die. <LF>Glory to the League.<LF>K.

Long underestimated by his peers, General Demosthenes wished to prove his mettle in the blood of Spartan Polemarchs.

Id: [0x0023DD68]
Demosthenes, while an experienced tactician with many victories, was dogged by early failures. In removing Spartan Leaders, he hoped to make clear his cunning.

Id: [0x0023DD69]
Seeing the success of his initiative thus far, Demosthenes determined to maintain his course. Many Spartan Polemarchs would lose their lives at his word.

Id: [0x0023DD6A]
Though steeped in blood, Demosthenes pursued his course. Far better to take Spartan lives than lose Athenian ones.

Considered ruthless, the much-feared General Lysander was not numb to the horror of war. His desire was to bring it to a quick end while ensuring that he would reap the benefits of victory.

Id: [0x0023DF07]
While many Leaders were positioned for greatness by lineage, Lysander was not born into luxury. Humble origins stoked his fire, and also his bitterness.

Id: [0x0023DF0C]
Lysander’s ruthless disregard for enemies was more than tactics. It was a restless beast within him. The General only needed to hitch the demons to his chariot.

Id: [0x0023DF25]
General Lysander always made a careful study of his enemies. As we’re all bound to our character, this skill, above all others, would promise him the upper hand.

An infusion of buckthorn is known to heal many ailments. Yet, one herbalist could not hope to deliver it, as the roads were full of bandits and wild beasts.

Id: [0x0023FC2C]

A spy passing messages to the temple arranged for votive figure offerings bearing secret messages to be delivered.

Id: [0x0023FC7B]
Alone behind enemy lines, it was thought that spies were entirely on their own, yet one spy is said to have sent a warning to another that he was in danger.

Id: [0x0023FC7C]
Changes in battle plans sometimes moved faster than messages could travel, and a spy with new information needed help completing her mission.

Id: [0x0023FC80]

Animal bladders were used as a place to hide secret messages. A spy looked to rescue a hunter who provided her with bladders.

Id: [0x0023FC86]
Although there is some doubt about this story, it is said that a spy was hiding secret messages in the bellies of goats, and a rival spy wanted her stopped.

Id: [0x0023FC87]
A woman who was passing information to Athenians looked for help when her husband was thought to be the spy and was taken by bandits.

Id: [0x0023FC88]
A spy sent the wrong code and then waited too long to give a warning before Athenian ships approached, so she begged for help. No record exists of her next assignment.

Id: [0x0023FC89]
A spy who claimed her jewelry was inscribed with secret codes had her earrings stolen by bandits.

Id: [0x0023FC8A]
Bandits stole a secret message without knowing what they had, as the message was inscribed on a bridle stolen from a merchant.

Id: [0x0023FC8F]
The constant need for messages passing between heralds and spies made it necessary for even a skilled misthios to sometimes be involved in message passing.

Id: [0x0023FC90]
An Athenian Commander was plotted against by a spy who hid a message sewn into sandals for a hetaera, who was to see to the Commander’s destruction.

A spy wished to strike at the Spartans and hired Kassandra, knowing that she had ended the Wolf of Sparta.

Id: [0x0023FC9D]

Id: [0x0023FC9E]
Thus Kassandra came to the attention of a spy who was working to gather power in Kleon’s name. The spy hired Kassandra to strike against Perikles’s guards.

Id: [0x0023FC9F]
The Daughters of Artemis had a strong affinity for nature and animals. When they learned of soldiers taunting a captive lion, they vowed revenge.

Id: [0x0023FCA0]
A Daughter of Artemis identified the trail of a wounded lion. Other beasts found the trail, and the Daughter wanted to avoid carnage.

Id: [0x0023FCA1]
The Daughters of Artemis targeted a Commander holding his own daughter captive, hoping to free her from him and take her in.

Id: [0x0023FCA2]
Accounts from both bandits and Daughters of Artemis tell of conflicts when the two overlapped territory. Daughters targeted bandits for poaching.

Id: [0x0023FCA3]
Daughters of Artemis did not look to outsiders for help, but when Kassandra saved one from capture by bandits, the Daughter asked for help freeing others.

Id: [0x0023FCA4]
A beast taken captive by soldiers provoked the Daughters of Artemis into action. One was even willing to seek help from a mercenary.

Id: [0x0023FCA5]
A merchant cutting down trees in a forest guarded by the Daughters of Artemis brought the fury of the Daughters down on his boat and his head.

Id: [0x0023FCA6]
After bandits set a forest fire, the Daughters of Artemis preferred to see the animals, who had no food or shelter, killed rather than allow them to suffer.

Id: [0x0023FCA7]
The Daughters of Artemis claimed to have a special connection with animals. One daughter claimed a wolf pack specifically followed her.

Id: [0x0023FCA8]
Soldiers, on the orders of their Commanders, pushed further into the wild lands guarded by the Daughters of Artemis.

Id: [0x0023FCA9]
Although warrior priestesses, the Daughters of Artemis hated outsiders coming to their lands to worship at wilderness shrines and wanted the shrines or the pilgrims dealt with.

Id: [0x0023FCB1]
Antlers, it was thought, could be powdered for use as medicine and so were in high demand. Daughters of Artemis gathered the antlers but needed them delivered.

Celebrating the death of a Spartan leader, the Athenians prepared a great feast, planning to slaughter many goats under the protection of the Daughters of Artemis.

Id: [0x0023FCB3]

After helping the women of Megaris, Kassandra was approached by a Daughter of Artemis who claimed to be a lover of one of the women. She wished to send meat to those starving in Megaris.

Id: [0x0023FCBA]
Festivals in the city drew crowds with drachmae to spend, but also bandits and beasts wanting to attack travelers and hetaerae on the paths.

Id: [0x0023FCBB]
A young man in love with a hetaera wanted to prove himself to her by hunting lions. The hetaera feared for his life and his business.

Id: [0x0023FCBC]
A hetaera entertained a client who promised her riches but delivered nothing. Her reputation at stake, the hetaera plotted against him.

Id: [0x0023FCBD]
Tales of deserters and hetaerae trying to flee the war together were rife. One woman, worried that her lover had not appeared, feared he was discovered.

Id: [0x0023FCC0]
Hetaerae, with their relative independence and wealth compared to many women in the cities, sometimes became the targets of thieves and bandits on the roads.

Id: [0x0023FCC1]
A client of a hetaera who ran off with her drachmae, it is said, did not expect the hetaera to take vengeance. He was mistaken.

Id: [0x0023FCC2]
To keep a politician interested in her, a hetaera wanted to make him jealous by sending him a token with an attractive young misthios as messenger.

Id: [0x0023FCC3]
A merchant who tried to trick a hetaera made the mistake of letting the location of his boat be known.

Id: [0x0023FCC4]

Id: [0x0023FCC7]
Pirates and sharks were problems for revelers who wanted to recover a sunken cask of good wine for their banquet according to one hetaera.

Id: [0x0023FCC8]
A young man mistook his desire for love, and the woman became afraid of his obsession. He followed her and frightened her until her friend looked for help.

Id: [0x0023FCC9]
Bandits who braved the soldiers in the city often preyed on hetaerae, thinking them defenseless. One hetaera looked to prove them wrong.

Id: [0x0023FCCA]
Traveling with expensive jewelry made hetaerae desirable and thus could earn them profit, but it also opened them to attack from thieves.

Id: [0x0023FCCC]
A soldier, drunk and confiding in a hetaera, revealed military information. The hetaera looked to deliver the information to an Athenian Commander.

Id: [0x0023FCCD]
Serving a Commander in camp was a good position for hetaerae, as it provided drachmae and security. Wolves and thieves prowled the paths to the camps, however.

Id: [0x0023FCCE]
Hetaerae desired a steady flow of rich and peaceful clientele, and were more interested than most in keeping the ports safe from pirates and Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x0023FCCF]
The shrines erected by the Followers of Ares had not only religious consequences, but also business ones, as the clients of hetaerae would avoid the area.

Id: [0x0023FCD1]
Kassandra met a hetaera who, by her claim, was to marry the Monger before his death at Kassandra’s hand. Kassandra claimed another mercenary was responsible and was hired to kill them.

Id: [0x0023FCD2]

Id: [0x0023FCD8]
A woman who claimed to be the sister of Pythia of Delphi blamed Kassandra for the oracle’s death. Claiming Kassandra owed her, she demanded revenge against the Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x0023FCDA]
Professional rivalry among smiths led to violence when one smith accused another of undercutting him with shoddy weaponry.

Id: [0x0023FCDB]
Because of their need for weaponry, bandits often treated smiths better than other villagers. However, sometimes they preferred to steal than to barter.

Id: [0x0023FCDC]
A Blacksmith of unknown lineage claimed his brother was a soldier at the front, and wished to have a blade delivered to him through bandit territory.

Id: [0x0023FCDD]
Citizens who resisted military control risked attack. For citizens with valuable merchandise, such as smiths, the risk was greater.

Id: [0x0023FCDE]
In order to feed his family, a desperate Blacksmith was forced to accept a bad deal from a merchant. The Blacksmith grew angry about the deal and plotted revenge.

Id: [0x0023FCDF]
Shipwrecks sometimes profited local merchants and businesses. A Blacksmith used sunken treasures to decorate his weapons until sharks chased away his divers.

A traveling Blacksmith became a target on the road when bandits attempted to rob him of his weapons.

Id: [0x0023FCE6]
A smith who had learned his trade from his father was surprised to recognize one of his father’s swords. Bandits had taken all the blades years before.

Id: [0x0023FCE7]
A smith was not worried about a threat from thieves. His strength and skill with a hammer - as well as his mercenary friends - gave the smith great confidence.

Id: [0x0023FCE8]
A camp of soldiers nearby meant that a Blacksmith had steady customers for his swords, but the soldiers’ bad behavior infuriated the villagers.

Id: [0x0023FCE9]

A dockworker who claimed to own a small piece of land outside the city was concerned for his wife after hearing of wolves on the land.

Id: [0x00247609]
Soldiers extorting drachmae or cargo from dockhands was not uncommon. A dockhand who could not afford to keep paying sought help.

Id: [0x0024760A]
After taking control of a port, Spartans mercilessly beat and intimidated workers and merchants. One dockworker decided to target their Commander.

When an expensive cask of wine was lost in a shipwreck, a docker looked for a mercenary willing to brave the wreck and the sharks.

Poor and often ignored, dockworkers sometimes heard more than officers and ship Captains realized. One docker learned the location of a wanted smuggler.

Thieves helped themselves to cargo at the docks, thus angering the dockers enough to contract mercenaries.

Id: [0x0024B3BF]
{FULLNAME} was often misjudged because of his looks. Those who got to know him claimed he had a gentle touch, a curious mind, and a heart of gold. He sang beautifully and always questioned his fellow man. Of course, if all of these things were true, his nickname surely would have changed.

Id: [0x0024B3C0]
{NAME} the Barbarian

Id: [0x0024B3C1]
{NAME} was a gentle giant and former general. None of his men spoke ill of him, either due to deep respect or the wine he liked to share. It's said his concoctions were so good, they could lead any army to victory. When his unit disbanded, he became a mercenary, but he claimed to hate the solo life.

Id: [0x0024B3C2]
{NAME} the Heir

Id: [0x0024B3C3]
Whether {NAME} created his nickname himself or it was given, nobody knew. What was known is that it was accurate. His endearing features were loved by many, and some claimed if they were to die, they wished it would be by his blade so they could look into his eyes one last time.

Id: [0x0024B3C4]
{NAME} the Seductive

Id: [0x0024B3C5]
Ever since he accidentally burned his first haystack, {FULLNAME} was fond of fire. As he grew older and more violent, his experiments left a trail of ashes and smoke wherever he went. It’s said he disappeared for some time, and many believed he was attempting to create a new type of fire.

Id: [0x0024B3C6]
{NAME} the Smoldering

Id: [0x0024B3C7]
When he was young, people made fun of {NAME} for his size. That quickly changed when he overheard someone laughing at him. It’s said he charged at the man and sent him flying. From that point on, he was called “the Ox.” He added the “great” part.

Id: [0x0024B3C8]
{NAME} the Great Ox

Id: [0x0024B3C9]
There was a story among soldiers about a lone masked mercenary who lurked on battlefields long after the fighting ended. Some said he looted the corpses, while others swore they saw him eating pieces of the fallen. No matter which was true, {NAME}’s nickname fit.

Id: [0x0024B3CA]
{NAME} the Vulture

Id: [0x0024B3D4]
{NAME} was once responsible for protecting the doors of Potidaia from a Persian siege. When monstrous waves came over those fighting, it’s said {NAME} woke up far away from the city he was supposed to protect. He stayed away from Potidaia forever, lest he returned only to be exiled for his failure.

Id: [0x0024B3D5]
{NAME} the Doorkeeper

Id: [0x0024B3D6]
{NAME} was a calm and gentle man who lived in the woods for most of his life. No one knew why he became a mercenary, but it seemed to coincide with the ancient gear he found in old ruins near his home. He religiously wore the set and killed anyone close enough to touch it.

Id: [0x0024B3D7]
{NAME} of the Woods

Id: [0x0024B3D8]
This former actor was the main reason his troupe dismantled early on in his career. They hated his constant criticisms of plays so much that they tried to assassinate him. They failed, which made {FULLNAME} realize he could force people to heed his words through the use of violence.

Id: [0x0024B3D9]
{NAME} the Critic

Id: [0x0024B3DA]
While many mercenaries cared not for how they looked or smelled, {NAME} felt he could prove mercenaries deserved as much respect or adoration as a polemarch. Always presentable, {NAME} did gain fans for a time… until they saw him do his work up close.

Id: [0x0024B3DB]
{NAME} the Clean

Id: [0x0024B3DC]
{NAME} started his career as a commendable misthios who only accepted risky contracts. When people began observing weird bites on his victims, {NAME} lost much of his reputation, even though he claimed the rumors weren’t true. Unfortunately, nobody cared to listen.

Id: [0x0024B3DD]
{NAME} the Cannibal

Id: [0x0024B3DE]
Almost all mercenaries traveled quite regularly, but they usually had a plan in mind, or a reason for where they were going next. {FULLNAME} cared not for planning or the future. It’s said he only followed the nearest path, not knowing where it would take him.

Id: [0x0024B3DF]
{NAME} the Wanderer

Id: [0x0024B3E0]
It’s said {NAME} once fought for Sparta, but left when he was asked to do something he didn’t feel comfortable with. In choosing to disobey orders, he lost the respect of his friends and family. As he traveled, he hid his past from those he came across, but it was clearly never truly buried.

Id: [0x0024B3E1]
{NAME} the Renegade

Id: [0x0024B3E2]
From Athenian polemarch to mercenary, {FULLNAME} was said to never take his work too seriously. Rumors said this was the reason he was sent away disgraced from Athens. He decided that the rules for a polemarch didn’t suit him anyway, and picked up the mercenary life with ease.

Id: [0x0024B3E3]
{NAME} the Nonchalant

Id: [0x0024B3E4]
It was difficult to find much on {NAME} as he seemed to change his name every time he went to a new city. Even though that was the case, the fancy gear he loved to wear and his pet lion made him easy to track. As for whether anything he said was real, no one will ever know.

Id: [0x0024B3E5]
{NAME} the Multi Faced

Id: [0x0024B3E6]
It is unclear if {FULLNAME} received his nickname from his inability to express any form of emotion, or whether there was another reason. There were plenty of reports that {NAME} was seen as heartless and without empathy, two traits that make for a great mercenary.

Frozen {NAME}

Id: [0x0024C97A]
Epidauros Sanctuary

Id: [0x0024C97C]
It’s said {NAME} lost the color in her hair at a very young age, resulting in various nicknames from fellow children. Over time, she preferred one nickname over them all, because she had the ability to freeze her targets where they stood when they saw her.

Id: [0x0024C97D]
Aipeia Port

Id: [0x0024C97F]
{NAME} the Poet

Id: [0x0024C980]
{FULLNAME} was known for her delightful stories and the way in which she told them. It’s said she once created her own poem, and it was the only one her audience didn’t like. They didn’t live much longer after that, it seems, and {NAME} never shared her work again.

Id: [0x0024C981]
Terror Gorge

Id: [0x0024C982]
{NAME} the Trail Maker

Id: [0x0024C983]
Many thought {NAME} would have been at a disadvantage because of her age, but the amount of blood she shed proved how experienced she was. She often left trails of blood from highly traveled paths into the woods where her traps were waiting.

Id: [0x0024C984]
{NAME} the Image Fighter

Id: [0x0024C985]
{NAME} was once a slave to a sword master. It’s said she spent much of her time watching him train. Even though she wasn’t allowed to wield a weapon, she constantly envisioned it. One night, they came under attack and {NAME} was forced to fight. So she did, killing her master in the process.

Id: [0x0024C987]
{NAME}, Granter of Wishes

Id: [0x0024C988]
Most mercenaries took their contracts in person, but {NAME} took a different approach. Those who desired her services had to leave a message for her, including how much they would pay, in a secret location. The only way her sponsors knew she accepted was when she showed up to be paid.

Id: [0x0024C989]
Forge

Id: [0x0024C98A]
{NAME} the Leopard

Id: [0x0024C98B]
People claimed they hardly saw {NAME} without her pet leopard. It’s said many of her contracts were completed solely thanks to the leopard at her side. Whether the beast ever hurt anyone or was simply there to intimidate, nobody knows.

Id: [0x0024C98C]
The forge was the place where metal was worked to make weapons, swords, shields, and spears. Blacksmiths revered Hephaistos, the blazing god of metallurgy and fire.

Id: [0x0024C98D]
{NAME} the Desert Rose

Id: [0x0024C98E]
{NAME} always said she came from far away, a land that was far tougher than the one she was born in. Perhaps if people believed she grew up in a worse place, they’d feel sorry for her, or even fear her more. Whatever the case, she actually grew up in {BIRTHPLACE}.

Id: [0x0024C98F]
{NAME} the White Widow

Id: [0x0024C990]
When {NAME}’s husband died, it’s said nobody saw her leave her home ever again. Yet, stories still arose of a woman, white like the moon, chasing people with her blade. Few saw her face and lived, but those who did swore it was {NAME}, although her eyes were no longer human.

Id: [0x0024C991]
{NAME} the Professional

Id: [0x0024C992]
{NAME} took pride in being professional in her job as a misthios. Unlike others, she always had a contract made up, showing all the agreed upon terms. Once, it’s said she lost the contract, and even though she succeeded in completing the task, she didn’t make her sponsor pay her.

Id: [0x0024C994]
{NAME} the Lyre

Id: [0x0024C995]
{NAME} was once a musician, and it’s said she never fully gave up this passion upon becoming a mercenary. Witnesses claimed to hear her humming a strange and eerie tune while hunting her prey. Upon finding them, she would smash their heads into the ground to the same tune.

Id: [0x0024C996]
Heraion of Argos

Id: [0x0024C997]
Founded in the ninth century BCE on a hillside, the sanctuary of Hera housed many buildings. The oldest temple dedicated to this goddess, protector of the city, was burned in 423 BCE by Chrysis.

{NAME} the Crazed

Id: [0x0024C9A7]
When a sponsor hires a mercenary, they often look for a particular set of skills. Skills acquired over a very long time. Skills taken from others. But sometimes, it wasn't about the skills, but the attitude. When people hired {NAME}, they knew what they were getting… a maniac.

Having a bear of a time keeping my honey farm safe. Sorry for the bad joke - never hired a mercenary before. I’m nervous.

I won’t be chased off my farm. If you can fight and need work, come see me.

Id: [0x0024CBF1]
The roads are crawling with danger, and I’m no fighter. Need someone strong to help me.

Id: [0x0024CBF2]
The roads and fields are unsafe. Monsters and men worse than monsters. Please help.

Need a strong mercenary who can swim and fight.

Thieves are walking away with my baskets of fish! Need help with these bastards.

I need an honorable person to help my friend. I can pay well.

If you have no fear of wolves or thieves, come see me.

Id: [0x0024CC1E]
The port has become a risky place. I have drachmae for the person who can help clear it.

Id: [0x0024CC1F]
If you do not fear the Followers of Ares, come find me. I have a job for you, and drachmae.

Talk to Aristophanes

Id: [0x0024CC25]
{FULLNAME} used to be a humble farmer, until her family was butchered by bandits in {BIRTHPLACE}. As she cradled her dying son in her arms, she vowed to hunt down all those responsible and all those she feared might become responsible for similar acts.

Id: [0x0024CC26]
{NAME} the Enraged

Id: [0x0024CC27]
{FULLNAME} could drink anyone under the table, night or day. She grew up on a vineyard in {BIRTHPLACE} and was the only daughter in a family of twelve. She learned how to handle her wine and, out of necessity, her strength as well. Her brothers quickly realized she was not one to mess with.

Id: [0x0024CC28]
{NAME} the Tough

Id: [0x0024CC29]
{FULLNAME} fought like a viper, leaping in and out of range of her opponent and jabbing at them with lightning-fast thrusts of her weapon of choice. The techniques she employed were strange and unusual, although it is said she learned from a very drunk man, hence her strange footwork.

Id: [0x0024CC2A]
{NAME} the Lithe

Id: [0x0024CC2B]
{FULLNAME} gained her reputation as a blacksmith's apprentice. She toiled away making weapons of war, until one day she decided to stop making them and start using them to hunt those who misused her beautiful creations.

Id: [0x0024CC2C]
{NAME} the Charred

Id: [0x0024CC2D]
{FULLNAME} had a reputation for killing her enemies before they saw her. She got as close as possible, then dashed out to strike before her victim had the chance to react. Oddly, there are countless reports that she was also known for stumbling from her hiding place and alerting her mark.

Id: [0x0024CC2E]
{NAME} the Quick

Id: [0x0024CC2F]
{FULLNAME} was stabbed, pierced by arrows, and bludgeoned countless times. Despite all of that, she was still an eager mercenary who was always looking for her next contract. Perhaps she simply didn’t feel pain, or maybe it was that she had something to prove. If the latter, she succeeded.

Id: [0x0024CC30]
{NAME} the Resilient

Id: [0x0024CC31]
{FULLNAME} was a blunt instrument if ever there was one. She was elegant in her simplicity. If someone gave her something to hunt, she wouldn’t stop until she had found it. In one particular instance, she sailed for three moons chasing her prey on the ocean and from port to port.

Id: [0x0024CC32]
{NAME} the Obtuse

Id: [0x0024CC33]
{FULLNAME} was a brutal warrior who yelled a war cry so fierce, they said even the gods trembled in fear at hearing it. Those who faced her preferred to stay as far away as possible.

Id: [0x0024CC34]
{NAME} the Steadfast

Id: [0x0024CC35]
The best mercenaries knew how to be patient, and {FULLNAME} embodied that. She tracked her targets for days, watching their behavior, learning their habits, and cataloging their every move. Once she accrued enough information, she picked the perfect moment to strike.

Id: [0x0024CC36]
{NAME} the Observant

Id: [0x0024CC37]
Mercenaries who had great control over their senses often lived the longest. Although {FULLNAME} was known for losing her vision, her hearing and smell seemed to grow stronger. This reliance on other senses turned her into a deadly opponent, one whose sight could never deceive her.

Id: [0x0024CC38]
{NAME} the Blind

Id: [0x0024CC39]
{FULLNAME} was a champion horse rider, but after one too many falls, she could no longer ride without incredible pain. She quickly learned to prefer hunting her targets on foot. People claimed seeing her on a horse meant she was focused and determined, not caring about the pain.

Id: [0x0024CC3A]
{NAME} the Brittle

Id: [0x0024CC3B]
{FULLNAME} was never one for a quiet life. She was always knocking things over or getting into trouble. It’s said someone must have noticed the opportunity if she became a mercenary. With a bit of training, she got paid to knock people down and make sure they stayed broken.

Id: [0x0024CC3C]
{NAME} the Clumsy

Id: [0x0024CC3D]
{NAME} always had a gift with animals. Those in {BIRTHPLACE}, where she grew up, joked that she was a daughter of Artemis herself. She was an expert tracker and was never far from her loyal companion.

Id: [0x0024CC3E]
{NAME} the Wild

Id: [0x0024CC3F]
{NAME} arm-wrestled every man in her home town before she went to the nearest city to find a worthy opponent. She was laughed out of every tavern, and so decided to find opponents who couldn't refuse her, by chasing late payments for a local debt collector.

Id: [0x0024CC40]
{NAME} the Lumbering

Id: [0x0024CC41]
{NAME} finds people annoying to the extreme. Wherever she went, she had people trying to explain things to her like she was a simpleton. One day she decided the only thing she wanted to hear from people was their cries for mercy. Over time, it’s said even those annoyed her.

Id: [0x0024CC42]
{NAME} the Irritable

Id: [0x0024CC43]
{NAME} found a dying wolf cub when she was starting out as a mercenary. She rescued it and nursed it back to health. The two hunted together as a pack, never straying far from one another. The wolf would track her target and howl, forcing them to run away and right into the arms of {NAME}.

Id: [0x0024CC44]
{NAME} the Pack Leader

Id: [0x0024CC45]
{NAME} had her eye gouged out in a hunting accident when she was a young girl in {BIRTHPLACE}. She adjusted quickly to having one eye and embraced her fate by dedicating her life to becoming an expert markswoman.

Id: [0x0024CC46]
{NAME} the One-Eyed

Id: [0x0024CC47]
{NAME} had a mysterious past that she refused to talk about. Her scars made many people believe she was the survivor of a fire, but the truth was far more sinister. It involved torture, fire, and the Persian army.

Id: [0x0024CC48]
{NAME} the Enduring

Id: [0x0024CC49]
For some reason, mercenaries gained a reputation that they weren’t smart. That they were useful only for their brawn or their combat prowess. If there was one mercenary who proved they could be smart as well, it was {NAME}. Few could boast they excelled like her in combat or a battle of wits.

Id: [0x0024CC4A]
{NAME} the Sharp

Id: [0x0024CC4B]
{NAME} always looked down on those below her. She was sometimes known to let an enemy take a free swing at her to make things fair. Of course, it was all a show. Even if she had allowed them five swings, it still wouldn’t have been a fair fight.

Id: [0x0024CC4C]
{NAME} the Hulking Tower

Id: [0x0024CC4D]
Drachmae to anyone who can help me put these cursed thieves in their place!

Id: [0x0024CC4E]
If you are strong and know how to use a blade, come find me. I will pay you.

Id: [0x0024CC65]
{NAME} the Hunted

Id: [0x0024CC66]
{NAME} evaded predators her entire life. With the help of her stealthy companion, she learned the ways of a furtive animal.

Id: [0x0024CC67]
It’s said {FULLNAME} was never caught unaware. Traps and ambushes failed every time, making her even better at detecting them as time went on. There is one story of a trap that worked. It involved a cute puppy and becoming so engrossed in petting it, she ignored her surroundings.

Id: [0x0024CC68]
{NAME} the Vigilant

Id: [0x0024CC69]
Those who heard the name of {FULLNAME} felt fear in the very depths of their beings. If rumors are to be believed, she once killed a lion in single combat and took his place at the head of a pride. It's not clear why anyone would want to do such a thing, but it’s how the rumor goes.

Id: [0x0024CC6A]
{NAME} the Proudmane

Id: [0x0024CC6B]
{NAME} was a mighty champion in {BIRTHPLACE} and a famous mercenary, but unfortunately she suffered some severe reactions to particular flowers. She tended to work during the winter months, and then retreated to her mountain home until the flowers had finished blooming.

Id: [0x0024CC6C]
{NAME} the Fragile

Id: [0x0024CC6D]
Once, {NAME} didn’t believe in fighting until her home was burned to the ground by Persians in {BIRTHPLACE}. She it all from atop a hill. With tears streaming down her face and one hand clutching a toy, she vowed to fight only for the highest bidder in order to restore her family home.

Id: [0x0024CC6E]
{NAME} the Burned

Id: [0x0024CC6F]
{FULLNAME} was known to disappear the moment she was almost caught. Some believed she didn’t exist at all. They were wrong, of course, as there is proof she did indeed exist, but she did hide her existence quite well.

Id: [0x0024CC70]
{NAME} the Mirage

Id: [0x0024CC71]
Sickness was a terrible thing for a mercenary as it usually meant time not spent completing a contract. {FULLNAME} attempted to avoid towns and cities if she could, as she had a habit of becoming ill when around other people. She preferred to hunt her bounties out in the wild where she was safe.

Id: [0x0024CC72]
{NAME} the Maligned

Id: [0x0024CC73]
{FULLNAME} was once an Olympic athlete, until a bitter rival injured her on purpose during practice. From that day on, she dedicated herself to becoming a skilled combatant.

Id: [0x0024CC74]
{NAME} the Agile

Id: [0x0024CC75]
{FULLNAME} was banished from her village in {BIRTHPLACE} for her quick temper and deep rage. It always took very little to anger her, and whatever caused the outburst usually didn’t live very long. It’s said even her own family and friends didn’t receive any sort of mercy from her.

Id: [0x0024CC76]
{NAME} the Fierce

Id: [0x0024CC79]
After she spent her early years toiling away in mud and dirt on her family's farm, {NAME} developed a strong resilience to ailments and poisons. This allowed her to experiment with them on her blades and arrows without fear. She was highly successful.

Id: [0x0024CC7A]
{NAME} the Resistant

Id: [0x0024CC7B]
Although people said she shone like the sun, {NAME} had a dark heart - always at the ready to kill. I believe her strategy lulled her targets into feeling safe, hiding her true intentions. I’ve been able to find more than one story of how she desired trust from her mark before she killed them.

Id: [0x0024CC7C]
{NAME} the Glimmering

Id: [0x0024CC7D]
Born to parents who were mercenaries themselves, {NAME} had the will to battle in her blood. It was a trait that brought many victories. While she was growing up in {BIRTHPLACE}, her parents took turns accepting contracts while one stayed home and taught her countless ways to kill and fight.

Id: [0x0024CC7E]
{NAME} the Child of Iron

Id: [0x0024CC7F]
Even though she was younger than her weapon, {NAME} proved age had nothing to do with brute strength. Those hit by her felt the strength and resolve of one who spent every waking moment training her body. Many of her targets died because they underestimated her.

Id: [0x0024CC80]
{NAME} the Youngster

Id: [0x0024CC81]
People claimed her face was as fresh as a newly-bloomed flower. She was taught to be ladylike, but {NAME} had far better, and more gruesome, ideas in mind. She never showed mercy, regardless of her target. She felt it was up to her to kill all those who saw her as just something to look at.

Id: [0x0024CC82]
{NAME} the Honeysuckled

Id: [0x0024CC83]
It’s said {NAME}’s strike was as steady as a beating heart. One after the other, {NAME}'s blows could be counted on. Rumors say she would only attack after ten heartbeats, upon which she would draw her weapon and take down anyone in front of her with ease.

Id: [0x0024CC84]
{NAME} the Heartbeat

Id: [0x0024CC85]
{NAME} only wore the most protective armor, and her appearance was not known to anyone. It's rumored she removed her helm only to her dying enemies. Oddly enough, it is impossible to confirm that someone has truly seen her face. If they had, they definitely didn’t share it.

Id: [0x0024CC86]
{NAME} the Unknown

Id: [0x0024CC87]
She never lowered her weapon. She always stood on guard. {FULLNAME} was said to even sleep with one eye open. She was always watching, and she always saw her enemies coming.

Id: [0x0024CC88]
{NAME} the Awakened

Id: [0x0024CC89]
There was always a risk in trusting any mercenary. Some had spies. Even their spies had spies. {NAME} was one of these spies, and her vigilance taught her everything. It’s said she dealt in selling information to those who didn’t have the time to find it on their own.

Id: [0x0024CC8A]
{NAME} the Spy's Eyes

Id: [0x0024CC8B]
Time showed that {NAME}'s allegiance meant nothing. Every friend she made turned to foe, and she got rid of them the way she knew best. It’s not known whether she was the reason for the quick turn or whether she was simply untrusting - it is only known that those close to her died.

Id: [0x0024CC8C]
{NAME} the Turning Tide

Id: [0x0024CC8D]
When {FULLNAME} cleared a camp, she made sure those who came by knew she was there. Some believed she did this as a sort of release, and that she only ever killed when she was in a bad mood or had something to prove.

Id: [0x0024CC8E]
{NAME} the Ravager

Id: [0x0024CC97]
I will pay anyone who can help me keep my husband here. Come see me.

Id: [0x0024CC98]
If you do not fear bandits or beasts, I have a job for you!

Id: [0x0024CC99]
I have drachmae for anyone who can help me deal with a camp of soldiers. Come speak with me to learn more.

Id: [0x0024CC9C]
Spartan soldiers are dogs! My drachmae to anyone who can help me get justice.

Id: [0x0024CC9D]
I’ve been cheated! Help me get my revenge, and I’ll pay you!

Id: [0x0024CC9E]
If you are brave in the face of both men and beasts, we should talk.

Id: [0x0024CCA9]
Champion's Blade

Id: [0x0024CCAA]
This sword is awarded to the champion of the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x0024CCAB]
Champion's Staff

Id: [0x0024CCAC]
This staff is awarded to the champion of the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x0024CCAD]
{FULLNAME} tended to keep to the wild lands, but it’s unsure whether it was due to his disdain for humanity or his large, furry traveling companion. He received his title and his bear by stealing honey from hives and feeding it to a lost cub. Their bond grew until they became constant companions.

Id: [0x0024CCAE]
{NAME} the Bee-Wolf

Id: [0x0024CCAF]
{FULLNAME} was known for his strange eating habits, often consuming food or drink that nobody else would touch. Over time, he grew used to the diet, and his body could handle anything. It’s said he earned money by eating or drinking weird things in front of drunk patrons at his favorite tavern.

Id: [0x0024CCB0]
{NAME} the Iron Stomach

Id: [0x0024CCB1]
{FULLNAME} was an interesting man for a misthios. It’s said he liked to befriend every stray dog in a town until they followed him around. Unfortunately, there’s more to that story. After every kill, he would bring the body to the dogs in order to dispose of it.

Id: [0x0024CCB2]
{NAME} the Benevolent

Id: [0x0024CCB3]
{FULLNAME} was sold by his parents in {BIRTHPLACE}, and grew up to join a group of local mercenaries. It’s been told he was used as a distraction in his first contract - left for dead. When they learned he survived, he taught his fellow mercenaries a lesson by leaving them for dead.

Id: [0x0024CCB4]
{NAME} the Betrayed

Id: [0x0024CCB5]
{FULLNAME} adventured in a forest when he was young and didn't return to society until he was an almost an adult. Rumor has it he lived with the animals and could communicate with them. One thing known for certain is that he definitely preferred their company over that of people.

Id: [0x0024CCB6]
{NAME} the Cub

Id: [0x0024CCB7]
{FULLNAME} was said to be an almost indomitable giant. He appeared one day, but nobody knew from where. Little more is known about him than that his nickname was well deserved, for shortly after meeting him most were in need of the Ferryman’s services.

Id: [0x0024CCB8]
{NAME} the Ferryman

Id: [0x0024CCB9]
Son of a fisherman in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} spent more time in the water than out of it. His specialty as a misthios was attacking ships and diving deep below the waves to retrieve treasure that he was responsible for sinking.

Id: [0x0024CCBA]
{NAME} the Fish

Id: [0x0024CCBB]
{FULLNAME} was infamous for running at his intended target, ignoring any projectile weapons. He claimed he liked to see the look of despair in people’s eyes as he charged, only gaining speed, until he reached them and ended their life.

Id: [0x0024CCBC]
{NAME} the Fist

Id: [0x0024CCBD]
{NAME} was not known for his conversational skills. It’s said he tended to not pause between words and sentences. People claimed it could have been bearable if he didn’t also speak in a low, rambling, monotone voice. At the very least, his quick talking meant he never wasted anyone’s time.

Id: [0x0024CCBE]
{NAME} the Quick-Tongued

Id: [0x0024CCBF]
{FULLNAME} came from {BIRTHPLACE}. It’s said he perfected his animal trade, but after a while, he found the challenge somewhat lacking. He turned to man instead. He was seen as a feared and cunning adversary who shunned the lights of the city in order to attack his prey in the dark.

Id: [0x0024CCC0]
{NAME} the Hunter

Id: [0x0024CCC1]
With poor parents who were always sick, {NAME} always avoided others as a child. Or, it may be better to say, they avoided him. It’s said they feared he was unlucky. As a mercenary, he seemed to prove that point, and often was injured in pursuit of his target.

Id: [0x0024CCC2]
{NAME} the Ill-Fated

Id: [0x0024CCC3]
{NAME} was called irrelevant by many. It’s said he would fight to the death solely to prove this legacy wrong. To be fair, he did deserve his nickname for a time. Although he ended up proving he deserved to be called relevant, it took far too long and his nickname stayed until death.

Id: [0x0024CCC4]
{NAME} the Irrelevant

Id: [0x0024CCC5]
{NAME} honed his skills as a hunter of animals and then of men. People said no one ever took him by surprise, which was quite an unfortunate trait when his friends wished to surprise him with a party in his honor. As the stories go, he walked in and simply said, “Oh.”

Id: [0x0024CCC6]
{NAME} the Jackal

Id: [0x0024CCC7]
Many of the orphans in Athens are never spoken about. {NAME} grew up as one and was forced to steal to survive. He ended up indoctrinated into the larger underworld, and found himself doing dirtier deeds for the city’s criminals. His agility and ability to disappear made him a favorite hire.

Id: [0x0024CCC8]
{NAME} the Nimble

Id: [0x0024CCC9]
People learned quickly that {NAME} was always angry. He was known for attacking a sanctuary protected by the Daughters of Artemis, defiling and killing people and animals alike. It’s said he was ultimately caught, tortured, and castrated before being released back into the world as a warning.

Id: [0x0024CCCA]
{NAME} the Raw

Id: [0x0024CCCB]
{FULLNAME} hailed from Thessalia and was born from a long line of soldiers who had served their country fighting the Persians. After a number of years of military service, {NAME} decided it would be more profitable to strike out on his own and became a mercenary.

Id: [0x0024CCCC]
{NAME} the Scourge

Id: [0x0024CCCD]
{FULLNAME} was a furtive sort, preferring to attack his targets when they weren’t looking. Bullied as a child in {BIRTHPLACE} for his small stature, he became keen to prove that size was no indication of power.

Id: [0x0024CCCE]
{NAME} the Sneak

Id: [0x0024CCCF]
{FULLNAME} was born to a wealthy merchant family in {BIRTHPLACE}. He grew up callous and spoiled, craving nothing but adventure. When his parents allowed him to leave home only with their best guards, {NAME} realized the only way to get what he truly wanted was to kill them and run away.

Id: [0x0024CCD0]
{NAME} the Spoiled

Id: [0x0024CCD1]
When {NAME} grew sick alongside his mother, the villagers feared it was a plague, and discarded them in the nearby woods. Stories say an herbalist found the boy, his mother dead nearby, and realized the pair had been poisoned. It became {NAME}’s life goal to find out who was responsible.

Id: [0x0024CCD2]
{NAME} the Tainted

Id: [0x0024CCD3]
For each of {NAME}’s victims, he removed a tooth and kept it in a pouch at his side. It’s said he planned to bargain with Hades when he died in the hopes his own soul would be released for sending Hades so many. A preposterous thought, of course. Hades would never agree to such a bargain.

Id: [0x0024CCD4]
{NAME} the Teeth

Id: [0x0024CCD5]
Little was known of {FULLNAME}, and even less is known now. He’d often join others to share food and drink, but hardly uttered a word. His eyes were said to be fixed on the horizon, seemingly thinking of his next destination. All agree he was looking for something, but nobody found out what.

Id: [0x0024CCD6]
{NAME} the Traveler

Id: [0x0024CCD7]
The favorite tactic of {NAME} was using local thugs for a frontal assault on a target. The men he hired often died, which is exactly what he wanted. It allowed him a distraction so he could sneak up on his target, while also making it so he didn’t have to pay the men.

Id: [0x0024CCD8]
{NAME} the Untrustworthy

Id: [0x0024CCD9]
Champion's Dagger

Id: [0x0024CCDA]
This dagger is awarded to the champion of the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x0024CCDB]
{FULLNAME} was an impressive figure of a man. At parties he was known to claim there was a secret to his great strength. He boasted that his constant obsession with training, paired with rigorous drinking, imbued him with an almost godlike fortitude.

Id: [0x0024CCDC]
{NAME} the Wall

Id: [0x0024CCDD]
It’s said {FULLNAME} always let the flickering light of the fire lull him to sleep each night. He confided in just one man that the warmth of the flames reminded him of his mother back home and when she used to rock him to sleep. {NAME} tried killing all who knew, but he was clearly unsuccessful.

Id: [0x0024CCDE]
{NAME}, Lover of Flames

Id: [0x0024CCDF]
{NAME}'s fury was hot like a blazing fire. Scorned by those he loved, he abandoned his past and was reborn as a warrior.

Id: [0x0024CCE0]
{NAME}, Son of the Sun

Id: [0x0024CCE1]
In a single conversation, {NAME} would claim to be a descendant of Herakles, Jason, and Leonidas. He proudly told anyone who listened that he slew the Hydra, showing five dried snakeskins kept in a pouch as proof. Of course, he would explain they shrunk considerably after he severed them.

Id: [0x0024CCE2]
{NAME} the Liar

Id: [0x0024CCE3]
{NAME} the Insane

Id: [0x0024CCE4]
As a child, {NAME} was shy, well-educated, and gifted. Unfortunately, his parents were slaughtered on a trip to Athens when they went to see a play. {NAME} was taken captive, and nobody knew what happened during those years. Nobody asked. They saw the change in him, and it frightened them.

Id: [0x0024CCE5]
{NAME} the Beastmaster

Each time new crops were planted, {NAME} found a new animal to train as his companion. Each pet loved him so much it would die for him. Often, they did just that.

Id: [0x0024CCE7]
{NAME} the Flame

Id: [0x0024CCE8]
Fire had always followed {FULLNAME}. At first it seemed accidental, but now we now know it was by design. He was orphaned at a young age when his parents died in a fire in one of the poorer areas of Athens. Random fires seemed to follow him throughout his life. Of course, he was the cause.

Id: [0x0024CCE9]
{NAME} the Intolerant

Id: [0x0024CCEA]
Foes never got away with much when up against {NAME}. When the fighting grew unsportsmanlike, all bets were off, and {FULLNAME} wouldn’t accept a loss.

Id: [0x0024CCF4]
His favorite time to strike was the dead of night. When fog bathed the streets, {FULLNAME} made his move.

Id: [0x0024CCF5]
{NAME} the Mist Walker

Id: [0x0024CCF6]
It's said {FULLNAME} received his nickname due to the habit of hacking away at his victims long after they’d died. Likely a rumor designed to strike fear into the hearts of his enemies, but few had the courage to find out the truth.

Id: [0x0024CCF7]
{NAME} the Masher

Id: [0x0024CCF8]
Many believed {FULLNAME} was successful due to his foul odor. Opponents were often blinded by tears in their eyes due to his stench, allowing him to strike. It’s said the smell arose from his loins, where he rubbed goat manure, believing it improved his libido... though it likely went untested.

Id: [0x0024CCF9]
{NAME} the Dungheap

Id: [0x0024CCFA]
No one doubted {FULLNAME} was mortal. He was injured many times and reportedly even set on fire. But no matter what, {NAME} always appeared shortly afterwards, grinning and brushing off whatever injuries he sustained. In some circles it was believed only tearing him limb from limb would stop him.

Id: [0x0024CCFB]
{NAME} the Durable

Id: [0x0024CCFC]
No one knew how {FULLNAME} lived so long. Many betted on his demise against superior opponents, and yet {NAME} often came through with a surprising and devastating attack when it seemed his defeat was imminent. Perhaps he was so skilled he simply toyed with his opponents.

Id: [0x0024CCFD]
{NAME} the Insignificant

Id: [0x0024CCFE]
{FULLNAME} became known for his lascivious comments to man, woman, and goat. His inexcusable language got him barred from many places, and captains refused to have him on board their ships for short trips, let alone long sea journeys. Nobody ever wanted to find out if he could back up his talk.

Id: [0x0024CCFF]
{NAME} the Obscene

Id: [0x0024CD00]
Though few mercenaries could be called savory, {FULLNAME}’s reputation came from his lack of linguistic elegance. He was once heard to complain of how he was never invited to symposiums, but with the language he used in his discourse, it was quite obvious why that was.

Id: [0x0024CD01]
{NAME} the Mouth

Id: [0x0024CD02]
Throw anything at {FULLNAME} and it would likely fall to the ground or hit him in the face. It’s said he broke his nose at least three times trying to catch something.

{NAME} the Blundering

Id: [0x0024CD04]
{NAME} the Hot-Footed

Id: [0x0024CD06]
{NAME} the Hen-Heart

Id: [0x0024CD07]
With such a nervous disposition, it's a wonder {NAME} ever became a mercenary. Some said it was out of desperation, while others insisted it was an act to lure foes into false security.

Id: [0x0024CD1F]
{NAME} the Meticulous

Id: [0x0024CD20]
Those close to {FULLNAME} said he could remember every drachma he had spent. Perhaps due to a good memory, but it’s likelier he feared spending, so there were few purchases to remember.

{NAME} the Envious

Id: [0x0024CD23]

{NAME} the Investor

{NAME} the Rejected

Id: [0x0024CFCA]
{FULLNAME} never had much luck with anyone, man or woman. It’s believed her work suffered as she searched for love, until the life of a misthios was the only thing for her. It’s said she would decide if she killed her target based on whether she could see a future with them.

Id: [0x0024CFCB]
{NAME}, Man-Eater

Id: [0x0024CFCC]
{FULLNAME} far preferred to be feared than to be loved. Though often told she was beautiful and would make a great wife, {NAME} decided that wasn’t for her. At the beginning of her career, she tricked men into giving her gifts. She then sold them for coin she used for her armor and weapons.

Id: [0x0024CFCD]
{NAME} the Fashion Soul

Id: [0x0024CFCE]
While many chose their armor for how protective it was, or what material it was made of, {FULLNAME} took a different approach. Every piece she wore was based solely on how much she liked the look of it. Colors, styles, and materials all combined into one glorious set worth praising.

Id: [0x0024CFCF]
{NAME}, Brother's Keeper

Id: [0x0024CFD0]
After her brother ran away from home in {BIRTHPLACE}, {FULLNAME} set out to find him once she had enough drachmae to live on her own. The war pushed her into many situations she didn’t expect, but she persisted. The strange thing is, there's no record of her ever having a sibling.

Id: [0x0024CFD1]
{NAME} the Stubborn

Id: [0x0024CFD2]
Failure is a normal part of mercenary life. Most took these failures and learned from them. Not {FULLNAME}. She believed her ways were the only ones, even if they did fail over and over again. Some believed she was like this due to laziness and not wanting to spend time improving herself.

Id: [0x0024CFD3]
{NAME} the Disowned

Id: [0x0024CFD4]
{FULLNAME} was once a member of the Daughters of Artemis, until she was exiled from their group as punishment. Some rumors claimed it was because she fell in love with a man and planned on betraying the Daughters. Others said she just wasn’t well liked.

Id: [0x0024CFD5]
{NAME}, War Seeker

Id: [0x0024CFD6]
{FULLNAME} was born in Persia and came specifically to join the war. Of course, she didn’t fight for one side or the other, but whoever paid the most. She had a sister from {BIRTHPLACE} who she once faced on the battlefield. Only {NAME} left alive.

Id: [0x0024CFD7]
{NAME} the Scavenger

Id: [0x0024CFD8]
For {FULLNAME}, drachmae was better spent on wine and women than on armor or weapons. After all, those things could be found on the battlefield. {NAME} could be found long after a battle was done, searching for a sharper blade or better armor.

Id: [0x0024CFD9]
{NAME} the Cave Woman

Id: [0x0024CFDA]
People claimed {FULLNAME} exited a cave each morning, pet bear at her side. It’s said she didn’t trust any building that could burn, lest she get caught inside. When asked what she would do if someone set a fire at the entrance to her cave, she simply laughed and said “I’d ride my bear out of here.”

If you climb to the peak of Mount Zas, you will see two smaller islands to the south. I can only be found on one of the islands in a pile of hay near a friendly donkey. Make a decision - the last traveler starved to death trying to choose between the two!

Id: [0x0024D031]
Look for a stone centaur in the middle of a pond in the Plains of Flax. Walk in the direction it faces until another centaur points you in a new direction. Though it will be difficult as the fog gets thicker, fear not, for I will be safe inside a cave of treasures waiting for you to find me.

Id: [0x0024D032]
As a champion, time is your greatest competitor. Go to the Hippodrome and climb up the second column closest to Olympia. Look north towards the peak. There, I will be sitting on the right wing of a Titan, who had to swallow this lesson along with his pride.

Isu Architecture

Id: [0x0024DDDB]
So, the Isu, aka Precursors or “those who came before.” They’re humanoid and they’re ancient. They have triple-helix DNA and six primary senses. 
The<LF>Isu say they created Homo Sapiens to serve them, and who knows if they’re wrong? Abstergo classifies them as Homo Sapiens Divinus, though they waffle on whether they’re gods or not. 
S<LF>metimes individual Isu say they aren’t, but usually they act like they are. They like to give themselves god names anyway.

The Capitoline Isu

Id: [0x0024E153]
So, the next thing to realize is that there’s ISU and then there’s Isu. The main movers and shakers are (well, were) the Capitoline Triad: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.
T<LF>ose three were scientists who formed a team to save the world from being destroyed by a solar flare. They were like superheroes with ulterior motives.<LF>Jupiter and Minerva appeared to sympathize with humans, but really only seemed to make a move after the Toba Catastrophe nearly snuffed us out. Juno was in it for the Isu, but mostly for herself.

Id: [0x0024E154]
LH: One of those world-saving solutions was the Eye that killed Desmond, wasn’t it?

Id: [0x0024E155]
AR: Exactly. It worked short-term, but long-term seems more iffy. If “iffy” is a word you can use when you’re talking about the end of the world as we know it.

Id: [0x0024E156]
LH: Aletheia did seem to imply that reality was shifting. Or that multiple realities were shifting as calculations were made.

Id: [0x0024E157]
AR: I thought you were leaving me the philosophy?

Id: [0x0024E161]
Juno

Id: [0x0024E162]
So one of the most powerful Isu was Juno. She raised an army of followers trying to help her and her husband Aita get bodies. She wanted to move out of “the gray,” or a virtual existence in some kind of spiritual-tech hybrid afterlife.

Id: [0x0024E163]
LH: And the Phoenix Project was going to do just that. The plan was so dangerous that neither the Assassins nor the Templars could take it on alone. So we teamed up… for a while.

Id: [0x0024E164]
AR: Layla, I heard about your colleague Charlotte de la Cruz. I’m sorry.

Id: [0x0024E165]
LH: So am I.

Id: [0x0024E166]
AR: Weird question... So I know Mr. Berg used some special explosive to make sure there wasn’t any DNA left.
<LF>ut wouldn’t there be some trace of the Koh-i-Noor? I mean, you’d think some shards of such a powerful artifact would have survived.

Id: [0x0024E167]
LH: Alannah, when Berg blows something up, he blows it up with extreme prejudice. That site is sterilized.

Id: [0x0024E168]
AR: So another weird question... How did Kiyoshi, Galina, and Arend get away then?

Id: [0x0024E169]

Hermes

Id: [0x0024E199]
We don’t know much about this Isu, except that he was one. The Greeks and Egyptians both worshiped him. His special followers called themselves Hermeticists.
<LF>he god Hermes (particularly in the form of Hermes Trismegistus) was all about magic and alchemy, and his staff is the inspiration for the caduceus. <LF>In theory, he met Pythagoras and gave him his staff.

Id: [0x0024E19A]
LH: We’re betting a lot on that theory. We’ve extrapolated that the staff is the key to the Isu “equations of reality” theory. 
Bas<LF>d on the information we got in Egypt, the Isu are convinced that understanding the mathematical rules of the universe is the basis to changing it.

Id: [0x0024E19B]
AR: Are you convinced?

Id: [0x0024E19C]
LH: I’m convinced it might be true. And that’s enough to make that staff very powerful and very, very dangerous.

Aletheia

Id: [0x0024E1BF]
So who is Aletheia? She (that’s a guess, I didn’t record her using any pronouns) called herself that. She has a grudge against the rest of the Isu for their godlier-than-thou attitude.
T<LF>e Isu unified front showed cracks before, like that time Minerva and Juno argued in front of Desmond, or when Consus reached through time to contact the Assassins behind Juno's back. <LF>But this is a new level of insubordination.

Id: [0x0024E1C0]
LH: Fortunately for us, Aletheia seems to be on humanity's side.

Id: [0x0024E1D5]
AR: Yeah, she reminds me of Martin Luther, nailing his 95 Theses to a church door. Maybe this is the start of the great Isu schism.

Themistokles on Arkadia

Joined European Communities (now European Union) 1981.<LF>• Successively part of the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, Venetian territory, then Ottoman Empire.<LF>• Mountainous countryside with Mediterranean climate.<LF>• Called the “Birthplace of Western Culture” by historians.

Herodotos and His Work

Id: [0x0024E59D]
• Herodotos called the “Father of History.”
•<LF>Influential family. Herodotos was himself forced to go into exile in Samos, but then took part in the coup that overthrew Lygdamis. <LF>• Studied and wrote history/travel books. Gave public lectures. Gained fame and drachmae.<LF>• Greatest work was his Histories. Relies on interviews rather than records (which generally didn’t exist anyway). Accuracy disputed, but influence undeniable. 
<LF> His work is credited with saving a mass of invaluable information on archaic and early classical Greece. His work is methodical and extensive. (AR)

Id: [0x0024E59E]
LH: He wrote about Greece and surrounding areas. He traveled the Black Sea, visited the Scythians, and lived in Egypt for months. His books were like travel guides to the ancient world.<LF>AH: True. Though some of his work on non-Greek cultures was... specious. <LF>LH: You mean that there wasn't a tribe of cannibals in India who threw feasts with their deceased friends as both guests of honor and the main course?<LF>AH: I'll say a hard no to that. <LF>LH: Let's hope his "Lost Book" doesn't include that kind of cultural glitch. <LF>AH: From what I've been able to interpret so far, he does mention a group of ancient geniuses who sound suspiciously like the Isu.  <LF>LH: His “Lost Book” is supposed to contain the story of a heretofore unknown hero who was a descendant of Leonidas I of Sparta. And we know the Spear of Leonidas is an Isu artifact.
A<LF>: Leave it to the Father of History to connect the dots.

Id: [0x0024E5B4]
LH: Healing or time manipulation? If we’re right, this staff can rewrite the rules of physics, including entropy. And we already know the Isu are capable of interacting with reality in a way that disregards any normal timeline.

Id: [0x0024FA79]
AH: Hacking? Is that what she was doing to the retransmissions?

Id: [0x0024FA7A]
LH: Sorry, I realize that’s more my department than yours. You heard the voice change, right? That’s when the retransmission got hacked, replaced right under the other Isu’s metaphorical nose.

Id: [0x0024FA7B]
AH: How do you think she did it?

Id: [0x0024FA7C]
LH: Good question. If you want to brute force the problem, try all the security protocols until you find one that works. Then lock everyone else out so they can’t undo your work. Or if you’re analog, get a stronger transmitter Mexican-radio-style.
A<LF>etheia’s big advantage is having all the time in the world to find a solution. Like Consus, she seems to be able to see multiple times at once and communicate across them.

Reconsidering Reality

Id: [0x0024FA82]
The Equations of Reality theory posits that the nature of the universe is dictated by mathematical equations, and that someone who can understand these equations can rewrite reality.<LF> The Isu seem to have mastered checking the equations. After all, Minerva and Juno told us they ran all kinds of simulations to figure out how to save civilization from planet-scorching solar flares.<LF> But have they reached a stage where they can rewrite the equations? And now that we have the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus, have we?

Id: [0x0024FA83]
LH: If you want to think in that direction... If the Isu already knew how to rewrite the equations, would we realize it? Pythagoras was part of the Isu bloodline. What if he managed it and didn’t realize, or forgot how? What if this is the simulation?

Id: [0x0024FA84]
AR: You’ve held the staff, boss, and you’re one of the bloodline too. What if you already changed everything?

Id: [0x0024FA85]
LH: That’s basilisk territory.

Id: [0x0024FA86]
AR: I don’t think Herodotos mentioned a basilisk anywhere...

Id: [0x0024FA87]
LH: Roko’s Basilisk. It’s a thought experiment. If an artificial intelligence was omniscient, it would know who its enemies were. It could also eventually figure out how to transcend time. Do you follow me?

Id: [0x0024FA88]
AR: I think? Sounds creepy.

Id: [0x0024FA89]
LH: Nice knowing you, Alannah. You already pissed off the all-knowing time-traveling basilisk.

Id: [0x0024FA8A]
AR: So, you’re saying we have to watch out for things we can’t watch out for?

Id: [0x0024FA8B]
LH: I’m saying, from now on, we have to tread very carefully.

<LF> His work is credited with saving a mass of invaluable information on archaic and early classical Greece. His work is methodical and extensive. (AR)<LF><LF>LH: He wrote about Greece and surrounding areas. He traveled the Black Sea, visited the Scythians, and lived in Egypt for months. His books were like travel guides to the ancient world.<LF>AH: True. Though some of his work on non-Greek cultures was... specious. <LF>LH: You mean that there wasn't a tribe of cannibals in India who threw feasts with their deceased friends as both guests of honor and the main course?<LF>AH: I'll say a hard no to that. <LF>LH: Let's hope his "Lost Book" doesn't include that kind of cultural glitch. <LF>AH: From what I've been able to interpret so far, he does mention a group of ancient geniuses who sound suspiciously like the Isu.  <LF>LH: His “Lost Book” is supposed to contain the story of a heretofore unknown hero who was a descendant of Leonidas I of Sparta. And we know the Spear of Leonidas is an Isu artifact.
A<LF>: Leave it to the Father of History to connect the dots.

Spear of Leonidas<LF><LF>• Rumored to be a powerful and deadly hand-to-hand weapon.<LF>• Isu technology, capable of multiple improvements.<LF>• Unpredictable mental effects. Genetic memory storage?<LF>• Passed down from Leonidas I to his grandchild. (AR)

Id: [0x002540DD]
Staff of Hermes Trismegistus<LF><LF>• Powerful Isu artifact, passed from the Isu Hermes to his devotee, Pythagoras. <LF>• Symbol of healing, inspiration for the caduceus (twin snakes encircling a staff). <LF>• Evidence strongly suggests healing abilities. (AR)<LF><LF>LH: Healing or time manipulation? If we’re right, this staff can rewrite the rules of physics, including entropy. And we already know the Isu are capable of interacting with reality in a way that disregards any normal timeline.
<LF>R: I wouldn’t even guess without more information.

Isu Architecture<LF><LF>So, the Isu, aka Precursors or “those who came before.” They’re humanoid and they’re ancient. They have triple-helix DNA and six primary senses. 

Th<LF> Isu say they created Homo Sapiens to serve them, and who knows if they’re wrong? Abstergo classifies them as Homo Sapiens Divinus, though they waffle on whether they’re gods or not. 

<LF>ometimes individual Isu say they aren’t, but usually they act like they are. They like to give themselves god names anyway.
<LF>LH: Wait, weren’t the ancient gods named after them?
<LF>R: It’s a sort of chicken and egg situation. We know that the Isu had other names before they took on the ones we know. Like Juno was also called Uni.
<LF>H: And just to check, Aletheia’s not a goddess name, is it?
<LF>R: You got it, boss. It literally means “truth,” but if you ask Heidegger (well not literally, he’s dead), it means the disclosure of truth. He dedicated huge chunks of philosophy to defining exactly what that meant.
LH<LF> What’s the short version?
<LF>R: Aletheia is “unconcealedness,” as opposed to correspondence (which is truth as accurate definitions of reality) or coherence (which is truth as statements that are consistent with the rest of a reality).
L<LF>: OK, I think I’ll leave the philosophy to you while I handle tech. Deal?
<LF>R: Works for me.

Id: [0x002540E0]
The Capitoline Isu<LF><LF>So, the next thing to realize is that there’s ISU and then there’s Isu. The main movers and shakers are (well, were) the Capitoline Triad: Jupiter, Minerva, and Juno.

<LF>hose three were scientists who formed a team to save the world from being destroyed by a solar flare. They were like superheroes with ulterior motives.<LF><LF>Jupiter and Minerva appeared to sympathize with humans, but really only seemed to make a move after the Toba Catastrophe nearly snuffed us out. Juno was in it for the Isu, but mostly for herself.<LF><LF>LH: One of those world-saving solutions was the Eye that killed Desmond, wasn’t it?
<LF>R: Exactly. It worked short-term, but long-term seems more iffy. If “iffy” is a word you can use when you’re talking about the end of the world as we know it.
LH<LF> Aletheia did seem to imply that reality was shifting. Or that multiple realities were shifting as calculations were made.<LF>AR: I thought you were leaving me the philosophy?

Id: [0x002540E1]
Juno<LF><LF>So one of the most powerful Isu was Juno. She raised an army of followers trying to help her and her husband Aita get bodies. She wanted to move out of “the gray,” or a virtual existence in some kind of spiritual-tech hybrid afterlife.

<LF>H: And the Phoenix Project was going to do just that. The plan was so dangerous that neither the Assassins nor Templars could take it on alone. So we teamed up… for a while.
<LF>R: Layla, I heard about your colleague Charlotte de la Cruz. I’m sorry.
<LF>H: So am I.<LF>AR: Weird question... So I know Mr. Berg used some special explosive to make sure there wasn’t any DNA left.
<LF>ut wouldn’t there be some trace of the Koh-i-Noor? I mean, you’d think some shards of such a powerful artifact would have survived.
L<LF>: Alannah, when Berg blows something up, he blows it up with extreme prejudice. That site is sterilized.<LF>AR: So another weird question... How did Kiyoshi, Galina, and Arend get away then?<LF>LH: Too soon, Alannah. Too soon.

Id: [0x002540E2]
Hermes<LF><LF>We don’t know much about this Isu, except that he was one. The Greeks and Egyptians both worshiped him. His special followers called themselves Hermeticists.
<LF>The god Hermes (particularly in the form of Hermes Trismegistus) was all about magic and alchemy, and his staff is the inspiration for the caduceus.<LF><LF>In theory, he met Pythagoras and gave him his staff.<LF><LF>LH: We’re betting a lot on that theory. We’ve extrapolated that the staff is the key to the Isu “equations of reality” theory. 
Bas<LF>d on the information we got in Egypt, the Isu are convinced that understanding the mathematical rules of the universe is the basis to changing it.<LF>AR: Are you convinced?<LF>LH: I’m convinced it might be true. And that’s enough to make that staff very powerful and very, very dangerous.

Id: [0x002540E3]
Aletheia<LF><LF>So who is Aletheia? She (that’s a guess, I didn’t record her using any pronouns) called herself that. She has a grudge against the rest of the Isu for their godlier-than-thou attitude.

<LF>he Isu unified front showed cracks before, like that time Minerva and Juno argued in front of Desmond, or when Consus reached through time to contact the Assassins behind Juno's back.<LF><LF>But this is a new level of insubordination.<LF><LF>LH: Fortunately for us, Aletheia seems to be on humanity's side.<LF>LH: I only wish I could do that kind of multitasking.<LF>AR: If anyone could, it would be you, boss.<LF>AR: Yeah, she reminds me of Martin Luther, nailing his 95 Theses to a church door. Maybe this is the start of the great Isu schism.<LF>LH: You've got a knack for naming things, you know that?<LF>AR: Thanks, boss.<LF>LH: Besides, she’s a hacker. I like her.
<LF>H: Hacking? Is that what she was doing to the retransmissions?<LF>LH: Sorry, I realize that’s more my department than yours. You heard the voice change, right? That’s when the retransmission got hacked, replaced right under the other Isu’s metaphorical nose.
AH<LF> How do you think she did it?<LF>LH: Good question. If you want to brute force the problem, try all the security protocols until you find one that works. Then lock everyone else out so they can’t undo your work. Or if you’re analog, get a stronger transmitter Mexican-radio-style.
A<LF>etheia’s big advantage is having all the time in the world to find a solution. Like Consus, she seems to be able to see multiple times at once and communicate across them.
<LF>R: Or multiple realities.

Id: [0x002540E4]
Reconsidering Reality<LF><LF>The Equations of Reality theory posits that the nature of the universe is dictated by mathematical equations, and that someone who can understand these equations can rewrite reality.<LF><LF>The Isu seem to have mastered checking the equations. After all, Minerva and Juno told us they ran all kinds of simulations to figure out how to save civilization from planet-scorching solar flares.<LF><LF>But have they reached a stage where they can rewrite the equations? And now that we have the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus, have we?<LF><LF>LH: If you want to think in that direction... If the Isu already knew how to rewrite the equations, would we realize it? Pythagoras was part of the Isu bloodline. What if he managed it and didn’t realize, or forgot how? What if this is the simulation?
<LF>R: You’ve held the staff, boss, and you’re one of the bloodline too. What if you already changed everything?
L<LF>: That’s basilisk territory.
<LF>R: I don’t think Herodotos mentioned a basilisk anywhere...
<LF>H: Roko’s Basilisk. It’s a thought experiment. If an artificial intelligence was omniscient, it would know who its enemies were. It could also eventually figure out how to transcend time. Do you follow me?
A<LF>: I think? Sounds creepy.<LF>LH: Nice knowing you, Alannah. You already pissed off the all-knowing time-traveling basilisk<LF>AR: So, you’re saying we have to watch out for things we can’t watch out for?
L<LF>: I’m saying, from now on, we have to tread very carefully.

Abandoned by her lover who claimed Athena made him vow to never fall in love, Polycaste had made her own vow. She would travel the Peloponnese and hunt the goddess - who was surely in disguise to trick her. In the meantime, however, she's taken her anger out on the unlucky who crossed her path.

Narkissos the Babbler

Id: [0x00255558]
Most mercenaries like to pridefully tell the tales of their adventures - some more than they deserve to. Count Narkissos among these mercenaries, who deliver more speeches than deathblows. Still, he is known in at least half the ports of the Aegean Sea for good and bloody reasons.

Id: [0x0025555D]
Nestor the Great

Id: [0x0025555E]
"Retirement is for the dead", Nestor always said. He had waged more war and collected more bounties for longer than any other he knew, and would continue until his own motto came true.

Id: [0x0025555F]
Testiklos the Nut

Id: [0x00255560]
Having been separated quite early in his life from his half-brother Testikles, his mood has been unstable ever since. He never felt as secure than with his own kin, so he deals with the separation by breaking things - including the bones of those who displease him.

Harpina the Heavy-Hitter

Id: [0x00255563]
Even as a child in her tiny village, Harpina was feared. Little boys who normally rough-housed for dominance wouldn't dare near the terrifying Harpina, whose quick fists could easily force their faces to meet the dirt. Instead, they curried her favor by bringing her trinkets and pretty rocks, which she happily collected.

Id: [0x00255565]
Edonos the Charging Bull

Id: [0x00255566]
It is said that you should never try to back Edonos into a corner. When under attack and threatened, he responds like a wild animal, resorting to a conduct unknown to civilized men everywhere. He bucks like a beast, and charges his adversary with the barbarity of a bull untamed.

Id: [0x00255567]
Iaeira the Overcomer

Id: [0x00255568]
Stories tell the tale of Iaeira and her record for having faced death more than any other mercenary. She has stood toe-to-toe with the afterlife more times than she can count, but is always able to pull herself away from the dreaded edge.

Id: [0x00255569]
Damais the Indifferent

Id: [0x0025556A]
It is a true blow to the pride of Damais's foes when they lose against him - not because he is weak, but because he doesn't seem to care. As a strong, trained mercenary, it's unsure why Damais is in the trade. He will fight with his all, yes, but a victory is just a victory, and an unsatisfactory one at that.

Id: [0x0025556B]
Astarte the Swamp

Id: [0x0025556C]
With dark eyes as murky as deep, muddy waters, Astarte the Swamp submerges her enemies in pain. She starts with a blow to the head, and watches as the blood drains into her foe's gasping mouth. Then, they start to drown.

Id: [0x0025556D]
Nanno the Abacus

Id: [0x0025556E]
With her love of mathematics, Nanno's parents saw her future in an Athenian treasury as a banker. However, instead of counting drachmae, she counts her number of kills. She keeps track of them on her personal abacus as she travels across the Greek world.

Id: [0x0025556F]
Occylos the Successor

Id: [0x00255570]
The story of Occylos is one steeped in uncertainties. The common thread is that when he came upon the body of a dead mercenary, Occylos, an outcast, began his new life. He looted the man's armor, sheathed his sword in his own belt, and started anew. He fights in honor of the nameless mercenary who birthed his new identity.

Id: [0x00255572]
Thaleia the Talon-Hand

Id: [0x00255573]
Those who encounter Thaleia while she's wearing gloves can consider themselves lucky; underneath are nails as sharp and quick as the talons of a hawk. She keeps them pointed like tiny daggers. If she knows she's losing, she's known to throw her gloves to the ground and bare her claws.

Laches the Eternal

Id: [0x00255575]
Laches is a strong, but simple man. Since he has not been killed up until this point, he is convinced the gods have granted him immortality. Instead of earning a name, he named himself "Eternal", and dares others to prove him wrong.

Abia the Shaded

Id: [0x0025557A]
"Always the sheep, never the wolf". This motto was carved into Abia's child mind by her military father. All her life, she was second to her sister - who was first in their father's heart. When he was killed in battle and the girls were orphaned, Abia set off on the road. No longer would she be second to her sister, and she would stop anyone in their tracks who tried to keep her from winning.

Id: [0x0025557B]
Hygieia the Sword

Id: [0x0025557C]
Hygieia's sword moves as fluently as her shadow, and they are just as inextricably linked. It's impossible to find one without the other. It is said that Hygieia learned the craft of making swords so she would be the only one who had ever touched it - and that in her eyes makes it perfect. Try to take it from her, and suffer.

Okaleia the Lotus Eater

Id: [0x002555BF]
Okaleia had her start as a nefarious smuggler who traded contraband goods across the Aegean - a profitable career, until she sampled the sweetest forbidden fruit to cross her port. Some say the taste drove her to madness. Ever since, she's been obsessed with tracking down its mysterious origins, killing all who she believes keep it from her.

Aretus the Aid

Id: [0x002555C1]
Surrounded by carnage and war, all Aretus wanted was to heal people. In a world covered with blood, what people needed, Aretus believed, was help. After devoting his life to medical service, one of his patients betrayed him by trying to poison him. If that was the thanks he got, Aretus swore to never aide others again.

Id: [0x002555C2]
Perdix the Wayfarer

Id: [0x002555C3]
Perdix never had a place to call home. He never knew his mother, or his father, but he knew the winding roads he traveled like family. He learned to identify poisonous herbs, and how to build elaborate shelters. When he had to make a living, becoming a roving mercenary was a role he took to naturally.

Ariathate the Winner

If people were born for certain tasks, said Ariathate, he was born to win. Strongest in his training camp and champion in races, there were none who could best him - though, he maintains his humility by always taking on a challenger who dares try.

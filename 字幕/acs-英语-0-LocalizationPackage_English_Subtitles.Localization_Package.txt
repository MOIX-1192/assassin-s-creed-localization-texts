Id: [0x000862DA]
Well now. What can I get for you?

Id: [0x000862E1]
Give me another like the last.

Id: [0x000862E2]
Are you sure you're all right, sir? You can drink all you like, but I expect you to be able to walk out of here at the end of the evening.

Id: [0x000862E5]
I lost my position today. How am I going to tell my family?

Id: [0x000862E6]
I suggest you sober up first.

Id: [0x00086604]
Everyone has the answer, don't they?

Id: [0x00086605]
That's very true.

Id: [0x00086606]
But our literature is different. It's an enlightening read, if you would like--

Id: [0x00086608]
Why not?!

Id: [0x00086609]
[laughter]

Id: [0x0008660A]
Well, what arm can it do?

Id: [0x00086810]
I bet a five pot piece we never see that money again. We've been had, mate. What in hell's name will we do now?

Id: [0x00086811]
We go back to work, and become wiser for the wear. That's all anyone can do.

Id: [0x00086836]
Jesus Christ on a raft! I couldn't have held it any longer!

Id: [0x00086837]
[relieved sigh]

Id: [0x00086838]
Much better.

Id: [0x00086839]
Oof...

Id: [0x0008683A]
[relieved sigh]

Id: [0x0008683B]
That's a relief.

Id: [0x0008683C]
My back teeth were floating.

Id: [0x0008683D]
[relieved sigh]

Id: [0x0008683E]
Oh, blast, I've splashed myself.

Id: [0x0008683F]
Thank God.

Id: [0x00086840]
[relieved sigh]

Id: [0x00086841]
That was a near thing.

Id: [0x00086842]
Finally...

Id: [0x00086843]
[relieved sigh]

Id: [0x00086844]
Much improved.

Id: [0x00086845]
S'all the rich badlings fault, innit?

Id: [0x00086846]
Here we go again...

Id: [0x00086847]
No, listen! Listen, it's... oppression, or summat.

Id: [0x00086848]
You're scammered.

Id: [0x00086849]
Now, anyways, I... ah, damn it!

Id: [0x0008684A]
See? Piss drunk.

Id: [0x0008684B]
Oh Lord...

Id: [0x0008684C]
Oh aye, you've got the stomach of a concrete elephant, mate.

Id: [0x00086868]
That's what they said to him. Then they refused to pay the bill.

Id: [0x00086869]
Well now. I can't believe someone of their stature would say that. I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.

Id: [0x0008686A]
You're calling me a liar, are you? I saw them.

Id: [0x0008686B]
If they did that there must have been a reason.

Id: [0x0008686F]
It's odd, I'll grant you.

Id: [0x00086872]
Perhaps he was speaking... metaphorically.

Id: [0x00086873]
Ugh, that bloody oaf!

Id: [0x000869B0]
Well, the situation is rather embarrassing... but I'm afraid I won't have the money for you in time. I'm a bit short, you see.

Id: [0x000869B1]
Embarrassing?

Id: [0x000869B2]
Sure you understand; I can't do anything about it.

Id: [0x000869B3]
Can't or won't? My employer lent you ten guineas-- hey! Hey! Look at me when I'm talking to you! Now you come up with the money or I'll hang out your bollocks as bunting. Understand?

Id: [0x000869B4]
I can't! I need more time!

Id: [0x000869E0]
[Contented sigh]

Id: [0x000869E1]
This is lovely.

Id: [0x000869E2]
Soon we'll be off to America, my love.

Id: [0x000869E3]
My father's firm raised those buildings, you know.

Id: [0x000869E4]
Lovely.

Id: [0x000869E5]
I've got to get to work. See you later, my love.

Id: [0x000869E6]
I saw him only yesterday. He had at least two bank bags.

Id: [0x000869E7]
Good.

Id: [0x000869E8]
It'd be a shame not to take advantage of this golden opportunity.

Id: [0x000869E9]
So here's what we do. You distract him with some flash banter and I'll give him the cosh.

Id: [0x000869EA]
Just got to wait for the right opportunity.

Id: [0x000869ED]
I think they posted additional guards in the past week.

Id: [0x000869EE]
Ah.

Id: [0x000869F4]
You're tall, dear. What is it?

Id: [0x000869F5]
There's too many people!

Id: [0x000869FA]
Let's get a drink, shall we?

Id: [0x000869FB]
Why not?

Id: [0x000869FC]
I want to see! I want to see!

Id: [0x000869FD]
Get off me, missus!

Id: [0x000869FE]
Oh, you don't mind.

Id: [0x000869FF]
I wouldn't mind you climbing on me like that.

Id: [0x00086A00]
What kind of talk is that?

Id: [0x00086A01]
Everyone, shut it! You're making me ears bleed.

Id: [0x00086A02]
Unbelieveable. You can't see anything, either?

Id: [0x00086A03]
We're too far away.

Id: [0x00086A04]
I can't see a thing!

Id: [0x00086A05]
Were you looking at her bum?!

Id: [0x00086A06]
What're you going to do about it?

Id: [0x00086A07]
Roger, leave it. No harm done.

Id: [0x00086A1F]
Oi!

Id: [0x00086A26]
[effort sounds synched to beating rug]

Id: [0x00086A45]
You fight like a dairy farmer!

Id: [0x00086A46]
Move along, you silly moo!

Id: [0x00086A48]
How appropriate that I fight like a dairy farmer, because you fight like a cow!

Id: [0x00086A49]
I'll wager you're sorry!

Id: [0x00086A4A]
Don't you have anything to say?

Id: [0x00086A4B]
She doesn't have to say anything to you, Wilson!

Id: [0x00086A4C]
Can you fathom how you have ruined me, you homewrecker?

Id: [0x00086A50]
Doesn't seem like it to me...

Id: [0x00086A74]
So I told the lads, look. If we're coming all the way out here, it's not as if we can go back with nothing. So. We nicked the catch from the next boat over. Simple really.

Id: [0x00086A75]
Meet me by the dock at ten. I'll have the kit you asked for. You just bring the rust (money).

Id: [0x00086A76]
Fresh fish, fresh fish... Don't be shy sir, come and buy!

Id: [0x00086A77]
It all looks excellent, I simply cannot decide. What do you recommend?

Id: [0x00086A78]
Well, sir, I've got some lovely trout. Very healthful it is. Here, go on, have a look.

Id: [0x00086A79]
Hmm... very nice, I'm sure.

Id: [0x00086A7A]
Shall I wrap it for you?

Id: [0x00086A7B]
I think not. What else do you have?

Id: [0x00086A7C]
Perhaps some lobster then?

Id: [0x00086A7D]
Where does it come from?

Id: [0x00086A7E]
The Welsh coast, sir. Very fresh, I assure you.

Id: [0x00086A7F]
Hmmm... I'll have to think about that a bit longer, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x00086C18]
And then - it's true - he threw it right in the mud!

Id: [0x00086C19]
Goodness!

Id: [0x00086C1A]
And he just scarpered, but you can still see here - I have the marks all over my trousers!

Id: [0x00086C1D]
And he bit you? On the leg?

Id: [0x00086C1E]
He most certainly did! Right here behind my knee.

Id: [0x00086C1F]
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

Id: [0x00086C20]
It's here, you see?

Id: [0x00086C21]
He's fine, all right? I said he would be.

Id: [0x00086C23]
God save us.

Id: [0x00086C2E]
Dickens's writing won't endure.

Id: [0x00086C31]
But Wilkie Collins is...

Id: [0x00086C32]
No!

Id: [0x00086C33]
He is.

Id: [0x00086C34]
You're making game of me.

Id: [0x00086C47]
Well, it appears to be a letter from your landlord.

Id: [0x00086C48]
Oh, lor' what does it say?

Id: [0x00086C49]
That he's had a difficult year, extraordinary expenses, and so your rent is doubled.

Id: [0x00086C4A]
Bad enough, ain't it?

Id: [0x00086C4B]
Perhaps there's some way of negotiating...

Id: [0x00086E66]
Well now... who have we here?

Id: [0x00086E67]
Why, a gentleman who made your acquaintance last night, I believe.

Id: [0x00086E68]
Why, so he did!

Id: [0x00086E6A]
[seductive laugh]

Id: [0x00086EE8]
Watching passers-by is every bit as good as a play. And much less expensive.

Id: [0x00086F02]
[30 seconds of playing air drums]

Id: [0x00086F06]
[laughing and clapping]

Id: [0x00086F07]
[frustrated cry]By God, I am thirsty! I need a drink!

Id: [0x00086F08]
[frustrated cry]No, no, no, no, no, no! The lemonade is ruined!

Id: [0x00086F09]
Ahh, it itches it itches it itches! Oh no, your Majesty, you'll not steal my thoughts!

Id: [0x00086F0A]
[Deep, slow breaths to Frame 2460]

Id: [0x00086F0B]
You think that if you do something, the others will follow you. But you poor idiot, don't you see that they will do no such thing, they won't follow you! They will let you go it alone, and you will die like a dog!

Id: [0x00086F0C]
Traitors, they are all traitors. All, I tell you! But not John no. He's always been good to me, good old John. But he died ten years ago, your John. Poor him, and poor you. Yes yes yes, poor fellows both of us.

Id: [0x00086F0D]
Think, think, THINK! Like the pholisiphers... err... the pliphosophers... The PHI-LO-SO-PHERS, idiot! How did the Romans do it, eh? In your opinion?

Id: [0x00086F0F]
Because you think you will escape from it, is that it? And what dazzling ruse do you have as recourse? The same that put you into this situation in the first place?

Id: [0x00086F13]
Aaaah, no! A demon, a demon! Leave me alone, demon!

Id: [0x00086F3D]
It's about damn time. An execution is a solemn event, it shouldn't be treated as a musical variety act for the public to see.

Id: [0x00086F3E]
It's not enough, if you ask me. Capital punishment should be banned.

Id: [0x00086F3F]
On that we'll have to disagree, mate. Some crimes can only be repaid with death.

Id: [0x00086F40]
Are criminals meant to be repaid or reformed? You think repaid?

Id: [0x00086F41]
Now, now, I don't want a philosophical debate.

Id: [0x00086F42]
That is exactly the problem! No one can agree on what to do with our convicts!

Id: [0x00086F43]
Keep them off the streets, that's it.

Id: [0x00086F44]
Yes, but then what? Do we want them to change for the better or do we want to rub their noses in the mess they've made?

Id: [0x00086F45]
I wouldn't trust a criminal who said he'd changed.

Id: [0x00086F46]
That, also, is part of the problem. And it'll only get worse now that we're not sending them across the sea anymore.

Id: [0x00086F47]
Something has to change. That's my point.

Id: [0x00086F90]
Here I am. Over here! Yes, here!

Id: [0x00086F91]
Over here, miss, this way!

Id: [0x00086F92]
Ladies, gentlemen...

Id: [0x00086F93]
Fresh trout! Fresh trout here!

Id: [0x00086F94]
Fresh sprats! Come and buy! Best catch 'o the day!<LF>

Id: [0x000870FD]
No, absolutely not!

Id: [0x000870FE]
But Wilkins!

Id: [0x000870FF]
I said no!

Id: [0x00087100]
I believe a country excursion would benefit us both!

Id: [0x00087101]
Perhaps, but...

Id: [0x00087102]
I know how troublesome work has been.

Id: [0x0008730E]
But... why?

Id: [0x0008730F]
It's not why that's the question.

Id: [0x00087310]
It's not?

Id: [0x00087311]
May I? Imagine you're in a cave, chained to the very back of it.

Id: [0x00087312]
I wouldn't let anyone chain me up.

Id: [0x00087313]
That's not the point. You're meant to use your imagination!

Id: [0x00087314]
But why?

Id: [0x00087315]
Well, consider what exactly is real and unreal in our daily lives. Could we return to the cave now?

Id: [0x00087316]
Do you really think we're in a cave? Look around you.

Id: [0x00087317]
Not a literal cave.

Id: [0x00087319]
"And as I rode"--

Id: [0x0008731A]
You wrote a poem?!

Id: [0x0008731C]
I won't allow your laughter to deter me.

Id: [0x0008731D]
"And as I rode the horny toad, a motherlode to him I owed, and then--"

Id: [0x0008731E]
Splendid.

Id: [0x00087375]
Gentlemen, gentlemen, this is a terrible mistake. I assure you, you have the wrong person.

Id: [0x00087376]
You hear that, Maurice? He says he's not our man.

Id: [0x00087377]
Then either you've got a twin or you think I'm a bleeding idiot. Now...

Id: [0x00087378]
I... I... swear I know nothing.

Id: [0x00087379]
We've already done with Ralph, but I need those diamonds and you're the only link to 'em. So tell us where they've got to. Kick him, Maurice.

Id: [0x0008737C]
[pained moan]Fine, fine, I'll tell you everything.

Id: [0x0008737D]
That's my boy!

Id: [0x0008737E]
Did you tell his lordship they were stolen? That you're a thief?

Id: [0x0008737F]
Right, thief? Right?

Id: [0x00087380]
Pfttt!

Id: [0x00087381]
Perhaps... perhaps I can get them back for you.

Id: [0x000873A2]
It's really as simple as that.

Id: [0x000873A3]
Shouldn't you be at home with her, then?

Id: [0x000873A4]
Well, to cut the line, the baby's on its way!

Id: [0x000873A5]
Congratulations!

Id: [0x000873A6]
How wonderful!

Id: [0x000873A8]
What's that you said?

Id: [0x000873A9]
That's not to say you both have bad names.

Id: [0x000873AA]
We're proud of our names.

Id: [0x000873AB]
They're good English names!

Id: [0x000873AC]
Thank you!

Id: [0x000873AD]
But Helga wants the child to have a German name.

Id: [0x000873AE]
I see.

Id: [0x000873B7]
Go and drag the foreman out of whatever gin palace he's planted himself in.

Id: [0x000873B8]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x000873B9]
And tell him if he's late again, he's sacked!

Id: [0x000873BA]
Yes, sir, I will, sir.

Id: [0x000873C3]
I was in the war, you know.

Id: [0x000873C4]
Oh really? Which one?

Id: [0x000873C5]
Crimea. I was a gunner at Sebastapol.

Id: [0x000873C6]
How fascinating.

Id: [0x000873C7]
I have a confession to make...

Id: [0x000873C8]
My left leg was blown straight off by a Russian cannonball!

Id: [0x000873C9]
Which leg? This one? Why you can hardly tell.

Id: [0x000873CA]
That's real maple, imported all the way from Canada.

Id: [0x000873DD]
You'll each receive a sum of fifty pounds. I trust it's enough?

Id: [0x0008742A]
[intermittent moans and incoherent noises till frame 310]

Id: [0x0008742E]
[30 seconds of tuneless humming]

Id: [0x0008742F]
Hush! Hush up! I'm tired of listening to your nonsense!

Id: [0x00087431]
Where are you? Where are you?! Tricky devils, I can't see you!

Id: [0x00087432]
What? Where are you? Where are you? Where'd you go, my friends?

Id: [0x000874B5]
Fair wages for a fair day's work!

Id: [0x000874B6]
No more exploitation! No more slave wages!

Id: [0x000874B7]
I nearly lost my arm in one of your infernal machines! Where's the concern for our safety?

Id: [0x000874B9]
Fair pay for fair work! Fair pay!

Id: [0x000874BA]
Ya, you want us to stop shouting? Come over here and we’ll see who’s shouting then! White-livered sons of bitches!

Id: [0x000874BB]
I see you! You want to lose some teeth? Yeah, I'm talking to you. Come on, then. Come on. Meater!

Id: [0x000874BC]
Ya that's the foreman! Right there! [raising his hands to his mouth] He's the one that's starving your children! Yeah him!

Id: [0x0008756E]
Come buy! Everything at reduced prices! Come!

Id: [0x0008756F]
Have a look! Lovely baubles!

Id: [0x00087570]
Come, step closer. Have a look at these beautiful things.

Id: [0x00087571]
Look here! Right here! We've got the best prices in the neighborhood! You won't find better!

Id: [0x00087572]
Come and have a look! Sir! Madam!

Id: [0x00087573]
Ladies! Gentlemen! Step over here and have a look at all my wondrous wares!

Id: [0x00087595]
Look at this! Bloody disgrace!

Id: [0x00087596]
What's your problem?

Id: [0x00087597]
Look how uneven it is!

Id: [0x00087599]
The text ain't even centered. And what about those capitals?

Id: [0x0008759A]
It's an artistic effect, a, whatchacallit, distinctive sign.

Id: [0x0008759B]
Look, you can't put capital letters at the end of a word, it don't make no sense!

Id: [0x0008759C]
I think it's rather striking...

Id: [0x0008759D]
I... I don't know how I'm meant to go on...

Id: [0x0008759E]
Hush now, my dear. We must be strong for the children.

Id: [0x0008759F]
Yes, of course.

Id: [0x000875A0]
This too shall pass, my love. This too shall pass.

Id: [0x000875C1]
Four of hearts.

Id: [0x000875D3]
I've forgotten what the last card was.

Id: [0x000875D4]
Actually, Rog is.

Id: [0x000875DA]
Ugh, I'm as limp as a wet noodle.

Id: [0x000875DC]
I think this should be my last. My son's coming home, to introduce his new wife.

Id: [0x000875DD]
Gilbert's married?

Id: [0x000875DF]
Won't be long until Gilbert has a son of his own. You'll be a grandfather, Michael.

Id: [0x000875E0]
Down the turd tunnel, that's where. Oh, Lord...

Id: [0x000875E2]
Mad Mike, a grandfather? Where has time gone?

Id: [0x00087619]
[quiet giggling]

Id: [0x0008761C]
The lizards! The lizards are everywhere! Lord help me... am I one?

Id: [0x0008761D]
No, no, no, do you not see? How much plainer could I be?

Id: [0x0008761E]
[mad laughing till frame 2150]

Id: [0x0008762F]
Now, I may have found us a way to get us out of this jam we're in.

Id: [0x00087630]
What is it?

Id: [0x00087633]
Oh, come off it!

Id: [0x00087635]
It doesn't matter. I won't ruin my good name, I don't care how awful John is to me. Now, James, there must be something, anything in the law that allows me a divorce while maintaining my reputation?

Id: [0x00087639]
There's no way for June's reputation to be left unscathed unless she is deserted.

Id: [0x0008763B]
If June were to claim cruelty, she would need firm evidence to support her claim, and in all likelihood even then she would still not be granted a divorce.

Id: [0x0008763C]
You talk of desertion and we all know that John will not leave of his own volition. Perhaps we might arrange for John to desert our dear sister.

Id: [0x00087681]
If you look at him - or her, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. It's disgraceful.

Id: [0x00087682]
Fancy having a pint across the way?

Id: [0x00087683]
What? In the most dangerous pub in London?

Id: [0x00087684]
It makes me so ANGRY!

Id: [0x00087685]
Of course it does! It should! You're absolutely right.

Id: [0x00087687]
Well, I'd best get home.

Id: [0x00087688]
Me too.

Id: [0x00087694]
Shall we?

Id: [0x00087695]
Yes, Mr. Willis.

Id: [0x00087697]
Very well. We are gathered here to lay to rest Mr. Graham Jones, husband, brother, and loyal servant of God.

Id: [0x00087698]
"I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die." Mr. Jones came to see me the day before he died. I cannot disclose our discussion, but I believe he knew his days were numbered.

Id: [0x00087699]
[sobbing]

Id: [0x0008769B]
His death was untimely and perhaps avoidable, but Mr. Jones died repenting his sins. He held firm in his belief, and will therefore live forever.

Id: [0x0008769F]
In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Eternal Father, take away our fear of death, bring us to the place he has gone to prepare for us, and give us peace everlasting. Amen.

Id: [0x000876A0]
Amen.

Id: [0x000876A1]
Amen.

Id: [0x000876A2]
Am...amen...

Id: [0x00087706]
Ahh, I can't do anything with this!

Id: [0x00087707]
Well, we ain't got no workshop, so make do with what we do got.

Id: [0x00087708]
Right, right.

Id: [0x00087709]
Pfff... This delivery will cost us. And the pub is still very far away!

Id: [0x00087EB0]
These streets aren't safe at night! Me ma saw a man get pinked over a locket he found in the mud.

Id: [0x00087EB1]
Was it even a nice locket? Bunch of savages.

Id: [0x00087EB2]
Does it matter? This thuggery is mad!

Id: [0x00087EB6]
What do you think will happen, really?

Id: [0x00087EB8]
Let's not forget where we are.

Id: [0x00087EB9]
We're counting on you, Nance. Can't do it without you. Isn't that right, Samuel?

Id: [0x00087EBA]
We'll need all the manpower we can get.

Id: [0x00087EBC]
Yes, womanpower.

Id: [0x00087EBE]
And womanpower.

Id: [0x00087EC0]
Womanpower, too.

Id: [0x00087EC3]
[Injured coughing]

Id: [0x00087FD4]
Pleasant weather.

Id: [0x00088010]
Is this queue even moving?

Id: [0x00088044]
I knew you gentlemen were coming so I prepared a special brew.

Id: [0x00088045]
I told you this was the best cup of tea in London. Miss Kate here stocks teas from all over the Empire!

Id: [0x00088046]
Capital! I can't wait to try some.

Id: [0x00088047]
Here, sir. Smell this. An' careful, it's hot.

Id: [0x00088049]
Hmm, indeed, what a scent. This takes me back to my days in India.

Id: [0x0008804B]
Thank you, Miss Kate.

Id: [0x0008804D]
You're both so kind!

Id: [0x0008804E]
Miss Kate, this is wondrous.

Id: [0x0008804F]
Pleased you like it. Notice how the jasmine's bitterness is subtly countered by the vanilla.

Id: [0x00088050]
Indeed!

Id: [0x00088052]
You should have him try the dragon's tea as well.

Id: [0x00088053]
That's an idea. The emperor's tea, that's what they call it over there.

Id: [0x00088054]
If you like, I can put some more water on to boil. However, that one is a bit stronger.

Id: [0x00088055]
Miss Kate, if I might...

Id: [0x00088056]
Yes, sir?

Id: [0x00088057]
I find this one... well, it's a bit bland. Don't you think?

Id: [0x00088058]
Oh, I should've known this one wouldn't do for men of such refined tastes.

Id: [0x00088059]
You flatter me. My palate is already yours, and you know it.

Id: [0x0008805F]
Who's the flatterer now, sir?

Id: [0x0008807F]
Get the latest news! Ask for the latest! You won't read it anywhere else, only in the Gazette!

Id: [0x00088080]
Have you got today's Gazette? All the latest scandals are here!

Id: [0x00088081]
Come and get your copy of the Gazette! All the latest news in the gazette! Get it here! <LF>

Id: [0x00088082]
You! Yes, you! I'm talking to you! Do you want to know the truth about the latest events in London? Of course you do, you just don't know it yet!

Id: [0x00088083]
One penny! Only a penny for the latest news. Get the news! All the details other papers won't print! All for the price of a loaf! Feed your minds!

Id: [0x00088084]
Hear the secrets of London! Clandestine societies! Gang lords! Bloody murder! All the latest revelations are in the Gazette. We print nothing but the truth!

Id: [0x00088086]
Come one, come all! The daily news freshly printed in the best newspaper in London! The regulars recommend it, the others don't know what they're missing. Get your copies here! Come and get your copy!

Id: [0x00088087]
Daily Gazette, ask for the daily Gazette! An incredible amount of facts written in a single newspaper, by the best writers in London!

Id: [0x00088088]
Hurry, hurry, there are only a few left! People can't get enough of it. The Gazette! Your paper of choice! Get it here!

Id: [0x000880A9]
Come on, come on, don't be shy, this is the best meat in London: lamb joint, mutton shoulder for roasting, ham to braise, nice plump chooks! Veal, chicken, sausages, pork, I'm getting hungry just talking about it!

Id: [0x000880AA]
Beef, good beef for body and soul, to lift the spirits and make your children grow! Come! Come come, good people, make the most of it!

Id: [0x000880AB]
Beef joints, beef for stewing, for all appetites, for all means! For gargantuan and delicate tastes! Best prices and finest quality, guaranteed with every sale!

Id: [0x000880AC]
Good for boiling, roasting or stewing! Got a family for Sunday dinner or did your husband invite his guv'nor home? Try our stuffed goose!

Id: [0x000880AD]
This, lady, is London's best blood sausage, prepared with my very own hands! On my oath, this pig and I were old chums!

Id: [0x000880AE]
Half a rack of lamb for you, sir? Why half? Have you lost your appetite? Couldn't tell to look at you, sir, you're the picture of health! Oh come on, don't be miffed, it's a compliment!

Id: [0x000880AF]
Look at this ham! At a shilling a pound, it's practically a gift! You're bleeding both the pig and the butcher!

Id: [0x000880B1]
Not just any old chickens, sir, newly fattened chickens! Better, fatter, plumper, believe me!

Id: [0x000880B2]
[coughing till frame 1575]

Id: [0x000880B3]
Pardon me, sir. Now, as I was saying, these are the finest chickens in London. And clean too, I assure you!

Id: [0x000880BF]
If the time ever came, I would lay down my life for you.

Id: [0x000880C0]
Do you really mean that, my love?

Id: [0x000880C1]
More than you'll ever know.

Id: [0x000880DE]
I think this is it, I am invaded by fleas! No, but yes, yes! They are not on my skin, but actually inside me. And it itches, it tickles! It hurts all and everywhere. No, but yes, yes! I've got in the arm, it makes ouch, it is unpleasant! Would need a glass of gargle to send them off to sleep, those damned fleas! Who's got gargle, or some money for a poor soul?

Id: [0x00088264]
Shhhh... There, there...

Id: [0x00088265]
It hurts. Hurts a lot.

Id: [0x00088266]
I know... It's going to be all right... Everything will be just fine.

Id: [0x00088267]
I have a fever, don't I? Feels like I'm burning up from the inside out...

Id: [0x00088268]
I need some wet cloths over here!

Id: [0x00088269]
Be honest, am I going to make it?

Id: [0x0008826A]
Of course you are... The fever is just a sign that your body is fighting the illness.

Id: [0x0008826B]
If you say so.

Id: [0x0008826D]
I do. Now rest.

Id: [0x00088270]
I know it hurts, but try not to worry. It will be all right. There, there, be calm...

Id: [0x000882CA]
How'd you do, miss?

Id: [0x000882CB]
I heard the news. Please accept my condolences.

Id: [0x000882CC]
Thank you so much.

Id: [0x000882CD]
You know I held your father in the highest regard.

Id: [0x000882CE]
I'm fine really. It was expected.

Id: [0x000882CF]
Yes, of course. You've had time to prepare.

Id: [0x000882D0]
You'll let me know if I can be of assistance?

Id: [0x000882D1]
You're too kind.

Id: [0x000882D3]
It's nothing.

Id: [0x000882EF]
I've been waiting all day for you!

Id: [0x000882F0]
I thought we were meeting over there.

Id: [0x000882F1]
You are so unreliable! I won't tolerate it any longer!

Id: [0x00088306]
Hey, you!

Id: [0x00088307]
I'm in a rush.

Id: [0x00088308]
Steady on. You're wanted on criminal charges.

Id: [0x00088309]
Want me to get rough with you?

Id: [0x0008830E]
That's right. You!

Id: [0x0008830F]
What do you want?

Id: [0x00088310]
You know very well. My money!

Id: [0x00088311]
What money?

Id: [0x00088312]
The money you lost at the races!

Id: [0x00088313]
Don't push me around.

Id: [0x00088314]
I'll do much worse than that if you don't settle your debt.

Id: [0x0008831C]
Sir!

Id: [0x0008831D]
Yes?

Id: [0x0008831E]
Are you Samuel Higgins?

Id: [0x0008831F]
I am.

Id: [0x00088320]
Now look, we've had reports of your lewd behaviour in St. James's Park. Thought you could get away with it, did you?

Id: [0x00088321]
You have the wrong man, constable!

Id: [0x0008832A]
There you are!

Id: [0x0008832B]
Excuse me?

Id: [0x0008832C]
You are in a lot of trouble.

Id: [0x0008832D]
I haven't done anything!

Id: [0x0008832E]
Do you call beating an innocent old man not doing anything? You're lucky he's still alive!

Id: [0x0008832F]
The old sod deserved it!

Id: [0x00088330]
How do you do, Mr Lambert? It has been far too long since I last saw you at the club.

Id: [0x00088334]
How do you do?

Id: [0x00088338]
How'd you do, constable?

Id: [0x00088339]
A fine day, is it not?

Id: [0x0008833A]
Indeed.

Id: [0x0008833B]
Farewell, sir.

Id: [0x0008833C]
Greetings, sir.

Id: [0x0008833D]
Keeping our streets safe, I hope.

Id: [0x0008833E]
I take my duty seriously, sir.

Id: [0x0008833F]
And you have our gratitude.

Id: [0x00088340]
Good of you to say so, sir.

Id: [0x000883C4]
It's quiet today. Nobody's interested in buying.

Id: [0x000883C5]
Another tough month, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x000883C6]
Maybe there's something wrong with my shop, something that keeps people away.

Id: [0x000883C7]
I could repaint the front. Clean the windows. Or get a new sign. Maybe that would attract people's attention.

Id: [0x000883C8]
Nah, face it, chum. You're in the wrong business. It seems there just isn't a demand for high-quality merkins in London these days. Oh well.

Id: [0x000883C9]
Come come come! Don't be shy! You'll not find higher quality hair in all of London! Come and have a look!

Id: [0x00088504]
Mmmm... mother? I... I... Mother? Mother?!

Id: [0x00088506]
Yes... yes, I understand. Yes, I can hear you.

Id: [0x00088507]
[drawn out]No. Mmm... Stop! Ah! Get out of my head! RIGHT NOW! Go away go away! Stop, stop! STOP!

Id: [0x00088508]
Hey... But... what... Where am I? What do I do on this Earth? Help!

Id: [0x00088532]
It is time to make your peace with God.

Id: [0x00088533]
Do you recognize our Lord Jesus Christ as your saviour and sincerely repent your sins?

Id: [0x00088534]
Lord, forgive this lost soul and welcome them by your side, with the love you show to all your children.

Id: [0x0008854E]
Go in the peace of Christ.

Id: [0x0008855D]
You called? I am at your service.

Id: [0x0008855E]
Name of the father, son, and the holy ghost. We pray for the holy spirit to prepare this soul to meet with our Lord. Turn towards his light. The kingdom of Heaven shall be yours. Name of the father, son, holy ghost. Amen.

Id: [0x00088560]
Go in the peace of Christ.

Id: [0x0008858F]
It says so right here. Hamlet the musical. Opening in Paris.

Id: [0x00088590]
Something of a desecration of Shakespeare's intentions...

Id: [0x00088591]
The libretto by Michel Carre.

Id: [0x00088592]
That's certainly not an English name.

Id: [0x00088593]
The very idea. Can you imagine if we'd done a musical of Dumas? Or Hugo? [Frame 570 ono, laughter]

Id: [0x00088594]
Although the notices do seem somewhat positive...

Id: [0x00088595]
Well, perhaps the idea is not so terrible after all.

Id: [0x00088596]
Oh, it's the latest news from abroad. Africa! How interesting!

Id: [0x00088597]
Do you really follow all that?

Id: [0x00088598]
I find it fascinating!

Id: [0x00088599]
The place names confuse me.

Id: [0x0008859A]
You just need to imagine a map in your mind. Don't you have any geography?

Id: [0x0008859B]
What difference can it possibly make?

Id: [0x0008859C]
[Ono, starts laughing]

Id: [0x0008859D]
[laughing]What is it?

Id: [0x0008859E]
The editor does have a knack for a clever turn of phrase.[chuckle]

Id: [0x0008859F]
An excellent piece.

Id: [0x000885A0]
Yes! The author makes several good points.

Id: [0x000885A1]
I certainly cuts to the heart of the matter.

Id: [0x000885A4]
Oh! Another of Dickens' stories.

Id: [0x000885A5]
I must read it!

Id: [0x000885E5]
They say he's going to take the matter before parliament.

Id: [0x000885E6]
He'll look a fool.

Id: [0x000885E7]
You think so?

Id: [0x000885E8]
The women made sure their men elected him. He won't turn his back on them now.

Id: [0x000885E9]
Of course he won't. But it might harm him in the long run.

Id: [0x000885EA]
I don't see why it's so important.

Id: [0x000885EB]
Of course you don't! You've always had the suffrage. Ask an actual woman if you want to know about it.

Id: [0x000885EE]
It will be unfortunate if Mill doesn't get in again. That man has so many ideas. It would be impossible for him to implement them even if had another twenty terms.

Id: [0x000885EF]
I'd be happy if he had two.

Id: [0x000885F0]
You might have to be happy with one. He has the ear of the populace, but not the ear of the members of parliament. That's the real issue.

Id: [0x000885F3]
Well they said it would cause immorality, if you'd credit it.

Id: [0x000885F4]
What rot.

Id: [0x000885F5]
But what would you do? Tell a man how he should think?

Id: [0x000885F6]
Only convince them to be broader in their thinking. More considerate.

Id: [0x000885F7]
Yes, absolutely.

Id: [0x000885F8]
I've been saying you should stand for Parliament, but you won't listen to me...

Id: [0x000885F9]
I would but I prefer the company here.

Id: [0x000885FA]
I'll convince you yet!

Id: [0x00088614]
I have planned a bold stratagem for your sake.

Id: [0x00088615]
I had a person come and tell him that the workmen employed on his house accidentally discovered a treasure, in digging the foundations.<LF>

Id: [0x00088616]
Well, that was an excellent performance.

Id: [0x00088617]
Oh. [small laugh]Really. Well, thank you. I am delighted to think that our performance will be.[pause for the flourish at Frame 2025]...a success.

Id: [0x00088618]
Do you think you might perhaps want to put your arms into it a bit more? Give people more acting for their money?

Id: [0x0008861C]
You have to make the big gestures for the people in the gallery. Otherwise they can't see what's happening. It gets a bit more...[Frame 2538, with hand gesture] feeling across. Understand?

This goose is mine!

Id: [0x000887EC]
No such thing! I ordered that bird, and also two fattened hens!

Id: [0x000887ED]
Sorry, no hens today.

Id: [0x000887EE]
Why not?

Id: [0x000887EF]
Those were promised to me!

Id: [0x000887F0]
Poppycock!

Id: [0x000887F1]
And my goose?

Id: [0x000887F2]
The hens was all sold early this morning...

Id: [0x000887F3]
Outrageous!

Id: [0x000887F4]
Nonsense!

Id: [0x000887F5]
Now now... what about a nice duck?

Id: [0x000887F7]
Do I look like I want a duck?

Id: [0x000887F9]
It's a lovely duck.

Id: [0x000887FA]
I don't care if it's fit for the queen's table, I want a bloody goose!

Id: [0x000887FB]
The goose is mine, actually.

Id: [0x000887FC]
I'll be damned if it is! I ordered it and two hens last week!

Id: [0x000887FD]
There's nothing I can do, sir.

Id: [0x0008881F]
Nothing?

Id: [0x00088824]
How about a rope to string you up with, you villain?

Id: [0x00088825]
Say what?

Id: [0x00088826]
Your beef was spoilt right through. My boy nearly died!

Id: [0x00088828]
Impossible! I butcher my beef fresh every day!

Id: [0x0008882A]
Look here, I want a ham.

Id: [0x0008882B]
Right you are, sir, right away.

Id: [0x0008882C]
Well I still want a ham!

Id: [0x00088834]
What may I get you today?

Id: [0x00088835]
Did you not hear me? This meat is poison!

Id: [0x0008886B]
I'd like a brace of rabbits, please.

Id: [0x0008886C]
Sorry, madam, fresh out of rabbit today. But I can give you a nice hare to jug.

Id: [0x0008886D]
I suppose it will have to do.

Id: [0x0008886E]
And you sir?

Id: [0x0008886F]
Half pound of sausage, please.

Id: [0x00088870]
Right you are sir, half a pound of lovely mince. That'll be 8 pence.

Id: [0x00088871]
8 pence? That's robbery!

I don't know. How about chicken?

Id: [0x000889A0]
No, some chicken gave me a nasty turn once. How about a roast instead?

Id: [0x000889A1]
Right, a roast would be lovely.

Id: [0x000889A2]
Some options there. Maybe a tenderloin. Any of these would be good.

Id: [0x000889A3]
Right. Cost a bleeding fortune, though, don't it?

Id: [0x000889A4]
Consider it a birthday present from me to you, old friend.

Id: [0x000889A5]
There's a good scent coming from over here.

Id: [0x000889A6]
If it smells good, I'll eat it.

Id: [0x000889AD]
Ah, the smell of raw beef. Lovely.

Id: [0x000889C2]
Now, are you sure this pork is safe to eat? I see small bugs floating around it.

Id: [0x000889C4]
Look at all these. They're disgusting!

Id: [0x000889C5]
I insist on the very freshest pork for my family.

Id: [0x00088A50]
Nurse, I'd like to review your report with you.

Id: [0x00088A51]
As you wish, doctor. I've had eight patients today.

Id: [0x00088A52]
Let's start with this one: the man who lost his leg in bed seventeen. "Still complains of limb pain"?

Id: [0x00088A53]
We've administered morphine.

Id: [0x00088A54]
So give him more!

Id: [0x00088A55]
Doctor! The patient is not terminal and... well... too much could prove dangerous. I've seen it before. The patient falls asleep... only they never wake.

Id: [0x00088A56]
Give him another dose. I assure you everything will be just fine.

Id: [0x00088A5F]
Yes, doctor.

Id: [0x00088A6F]
But doctor, those beds are occupied. Where am I to put those people? Many are too ill to be moved.

Id: [0x00088A84]
Thank you in advance, ladies and gentlemen, for helping an old blockade runner who lost his arm aiding our American cousins...

Id: [0x00088A85]
Please, in honor of my sacrifice for their struggle, a small coin for a meal.

Id: [0x00088A86]
Please, good people, a look, a kind deed. I cannot hold out more than one hand. Help me...

Id: [0x00088A87]
I was not armless before I crossed the ocean. No sir. But when I came back, my homeland turned its back on me. What will I do without your help? A small gesture, ladies, gentlemen...

Id: [0x00088A89]
I was in the navy myself. Take this, from one old salt to another.

Id: [0x00088A8C]
Oh thank you, sir! Heaven bless you!

Id: [0x00088A8D]
A sailor, you say?

Id: [0x00088A8E]
My tale, and it is a cautionary tale for those who believe themselves immune to vice as I did, begins not long ago in a public house not far from here...

Id: [0x00088A8F]
I was a wealthy man once. I had a country estate. Where did it all go wrong? How did I end up here?

Id: [0x00088A90]
People see me lying here. They despise me. They pass me by because I'm poor and dirty. All because I'm poor and dirty. [sighs] Just because I'm poor and dirty.

Id: [0x00088B18]
Ask him what he'll do for us.

Id: [0x00088B19]
I'll handle it, dear. All right? Don't worry.

Id: [0x00088B1B]
We should get that chicken!

Id: [0x00088B1C]
It's a good chicken, but that chap is ahead of us.

Id: [0x00088B23]
He reeks of the sewer. Tell me you smell it?

Id: [0x00088B24]
Did you just wipe meat juice on your coat?!

Id: [0x00088B39]
Damn these flies! Shoo!

Id: [0x00088B3E]
Excuse me?

Id: [0x00088B3F]
Well, the blood sausage is always delectable.

Id: [0x00088B40]
I'm overwhelmed by the possibilities, dear. Don't you find it difficult to choose?

Id: [0x00088B42]
Does that matter? Let's see...

Id: [0x00088C9A]
Over here! Over here ladies and gentlemen!

Id: [0x00088C9B]
Rare, exclusive, only the highest quality, items starting at only a penny! Come and buy!

Id: [0x00088C9C]
Ladies and gentlemen! Look what I have here! You've never seen anything like this before!

Id: [0x00088C9D]
You there! Don't be shy! Come and have a look!

Id: [0x00088C9E]
I have everything the well appointed lady--or gentleman--needs right here! Don't be shy!

Id: [0x00088C9F]
Step closer! Look! Observe the quality of this merchandise! Astonishing!

Id: [0x00088CA0]
Everything you need right here! The best items at the best prices! You'll not get better deals anywhere in London!

Id: [0x00088CA1]
Look here! New merchandise! Just came in today!

Id: [0x00088CA6]
[spits on the ground]

Id: [0x00088CA7]
Look at all these fine goods! Who'll make me an offer? Anything on the table I'll give you for a hefty discount!

Id: [0x00088CA8]
Look here - you'll not find better prices this side of the channel. I'm practically giving it away!

Id: [0x00088CA9]
Why what have we here? Why, only the finest items money can buy!

Id: [0x0008E712]
What a pleasant surprise.

Id: [0x0008E713]
I am glad you think so.

Id: [0x0008E714]
Only yesterday your brother asked me to spend a Saturday to Monday, heh.

Id: [0x0008E715]
Truth be told, your presence there is the sole reason I accepted his invitation.

Id: [0x0008E716]
Then I shall have to be watchful. You, sir, are not to be trusted.

Id: [0x0008E717]
Ha ha, that is my most appealing quality.

Id: [0x0008E719]
I hoped we would meet.

Id: [0x0008E71A]
As did I, my exquisite rose.

Id: [0x0008E71B]
Our families may not consent, but a greater force than they brings us together.

Id: [0x0008E71C]
The offer I made in my last letter still stands. More so with each passing moment.

Id: [0x0008E71D]
You know my father would never approve. But perhaps there is a way...

Id: [0x0008E71E]
Then there is still hope!

Id: [0x0008E721]
We meet again.

Id: [0x0008E722]
I am a fortunate man.

Id: [0x0008E723]
I thought we might never see each other again.

Id: [0x0008E724]
When you said you might be going abroad, my heart broke.

Id: [0x0008E725]
I've decided London's charms are not yet exhausted.

Id: [0x0008E726]
I'm delighted to hear it.

Id: [0x0008E728]
I trust you are well?

Id: [0x0008E729]
Indeed I am.

Id: [0x0008E72A]
All the better for having chanced across you today.

Id: [0x0008E72B]
I rather hoped we might meet. I know you enjoy a walk at this time.

Id: [0x0008E72C]
A gentleman would know to call at a lady's home.

Id: [0x0008E72D]
A more patient gentleman that I.

Id: [0x0008E82C]
So I say, that's enough! I mean, what're we fighting amongst ourselves for, right? It's the foreman's fault, innit? But he sets us up against each another, the bastard.

Id: [0x0008E82F]
So then everyone has a laugh, am I right? But here's the thing - it's not funny at all. I mean, here's the poor sod as lost his job, and the bloody politician walks off with all the money.

Id: [0x0008E85E]
When I was a child I spake as a child, I thought as a child... but that's impossible! I have never been a child! Nor you! For now we see through a glass, darkly!

Id: [0x0008E861]
It's obvious I'm wasting my breath. There's something... what's wrong with my feet? They won't stop moving. Stop it I say! STOP! Who's doing this? I'll find you! This is undignified!

Id: [0x0008E888]
Eww... Another time, perhaps.

Id: [0x0008E88B]
I cannot stay.

Id: [0x0008E88E]
I'm late for an appointment.

Id: [0x0008E8A2]
Mr. Griffin. Delighted to see you.

Id: [0x0008E8A3]
And happy to see the rumours aren't true.

Id: [0x0008E8A4]
Oh, you know what gossips wives can be. Particularly concerning 'private' indiscretions.

Id: [0x0008E8A5]
I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Goodbye!

Id: [0x0008E8A8]
The gods shine on me this day!

Id: [0x0008E8A9]
You're always too busy to receive my visits!

Id: [0x0008E8AA]
But you must hear my proposal! It is such a grand investment opportunity!

Id: [0x0008E8AB]
I wish that I could, but I have a pressing engagement.

Id: [0x0008E8AE]
This is such a rare pleasure!

Id: [0x0008E8AF]
I count myself the luckiest man alive!

Id: [0x0008E8B0]
You are having a party tonight, yes? With all those distinguished guests?

Id: [0x0008E8B1]
Um, yes. And I must make preparations. Excuse me.

Id: [0x0008E8B4]
I'm collecting for the Society of Reformed Criminals.

Id: [0x0008E8B5]
I have no time for pranks.

Id: [0x0008E8B6]
I'm perfectly serious. Criminals need help!

Id: [0x0008E8B7]
A good whipping is what they need.

Id: [0x0008E8B9]
It's my daughter. She's meeting the baker against my express wishes!

Id: [0x0008E8BA]
That is a family matter.

Id: [0x0008E8BB]
But she will ruin my reputation!

Id: [0x0008E8BC]
Nevertheless...

Id: [0x0008E8BE]
I've decided to become a policeman myself.

Id: [0x0008E8BF]
Then you should apply in the usual way.

Id: [0x0008E8C0]
But perhaps if you could put in a good word for me...

Id: [0x0008E8C1]
I don't know you, sir.

Id: [0x0008E8C3]
I'm a criminal. I deserve to go to jail. I stole an apple.

Id: [0x0008E8C4]
I think we can let that go.

Id: [0x0008E8C5]
But it was a sweet, juicy apple! And I bit into it with relish!

Id: [0x0008E8C6]
I'm sure you did.

Id: [0x0008E8C8]
Could you direct me to...

Id: [0x0008E8C9]
Can't you see I'm in a rush?

Id: [0x0008E8CB]
I wonder if you could help to...

Id: [0x0008E8CC]
I have urgent business!

Id: [0x0008E8DC]
Fine day, sir.

Id: [0x0008E8DD]
Tired feet, constable?

Id: [0x0008E8DE]
The law never rests, sir.

Id: [0x0008E8DF]
It's a thankless job.

Id: [0x0008E8E0]
You've got that right.

Id: [0x0008E8E3]
How'd you do, sir?

Id: [0x0008E8E4]
Apprehended any criminals of late?

Id: [0x0008E8E5]
No more than usual.

Id: [0x0008E8E6]
You are too modest.

Id: [0x0008E8E7]
All in a day's work.

Id: [0x0008E8E9]
Sir.

Id: [0x0008E8EA]
Any trouble today, constable?

Id: [0x0008E8EB]
No, sir, everything appears quiet.

Id: [0x0008E8EC]
That's good to hear.

Id: [0x0008E8ED]
Have a good day, sir.

Id: [0x0008E9E0]
How do you do?

Id: [0x0008E9EA]
Greetings, miss.

Id: [0x0008E9F4]

Id: [0x0008E9FE]

Id: [0x0008EC1A]
That's wonderful. Bless you.

Id: [0x0008EC1B]
It's the least we can do after all your wonderful work.

Id: [0x0008EC1C]
I thought your sermon was wonderful.

Id: [0x0008EC1D]
I'm so pleased you enjoyed it.

Id: [0x0008EC1E]
It moved everyone in the family.

Id: [0x0008EC1F]
You must come to dinner soon.

Id: [0x0008EC20]
I would be delighted my child.

Id: [0x0008EC21]
Well, I shall arrange everything with my husband.

Id: [0x0008EC22]
How good to see you.

Id: [0x0008EC23]
I missed you in church this Sunday.

Id: [0x0008EC24]
Ah, we were at friends in the country.

Watch it! Tom's got the creepy-crawleys in his beard!

Id: [0x00095FE3]
Pwah, just my luck, innit, bleedin' sitting next to you!

Id: [0x00095FE7]
Piss off, the lot of you!

Id: [0x00096040]
You must understand, I've received threats against my life. Malcolm Millner has all but waged war on me since Mr. Starrick bought out his company. And, no offence, I hope, but you do look the killing type.

Id: [0x00096041]
I doubt I shall ever recover from such a slight.

Id: [0x00096042]
What, then, is your interest in my redemption, Mr. Frye?

Id: [0x00096043]
I sense an opportunity that will benefit us both.

Id: [0x00096044]
Do you?

Id: [0x00096045]
Is that so hard to believe?

Id: [0x00096046]
Whatever your intentions, it will be quite the tonic to strike back against Millner and Starrick. I have worked like a trooper to make Attaway Transport what it is today. I will not allow anyone to bring me to ruin.

Id: [0x00096047]
Oh, and you keep your knickers all neat and tidy, then, do you?

Id: [0x000961F3]

I knew this day would come... [beat]Mr. Starrick was furious I lost the engines. So this is my comeuppance...

Id: [0x00096489]
Pearl Attaway led me to you, not Starrick.

Id: [0x0009648A]
Then they're working together again. I should never have come between Mr. Starrick and Miss Attaway. Family always stay together in the end.

Id: [0x000964C3]
I assure you, madam, Gladstone is innocent in this.

Id: [0x000964C4]
But he tried to kill my husband.

Id: [0x000964C5]
Well we'll look into Gladstone. Perhaps you can help me with another inquiry, madam.

Id: [0x000964C8]
You seem like a rough and ready sort of fellow, Mr. Frye.

I was talking to Rebecca.

Id: [0x00096640]
Anyway, Berg's presence confirms it. The Piece of Eden is in London.

Id: [0x00096642]
The Initiate's data synch suggests it's the Shroud.

Id: [0x00096649]
The Templars seem to want it pretty bad all of a sudden. They must know something we don't.

Id: [0x0009664A]
The only thing know is we can't go up against Sigma Team alone.

Id: [0x0009664B]
Leave that to me. In the meantime, keep a low profile. Let the Initiate continue to synch the data.

Id: [0x0009664E]
Do you know, I think this map may be taking us to the Kenway Mansion!

Id: [0x0009664F]
Kenway? The pirate?

Id: [0x00096650]
Master Assassin and pirate, yes.

Id: [0x00096652]
It's surprising that you haven't already searched the Kenway house.

Id: [0x00096653]
Edward's son, Haytham, joined the Templars. When he died, the house passed on to Haytham's sister.

Id: [0x00096656]
So, the Templars owned a house with Assassin treasures stored in it - and never located them.

Id: [0x00096657]
We must be better at hiding things than they are.

Id: [0x00096676]
Owning the railway wasn't enough. Now Starrick has bought an omnibus company as well. I suppose he wants to control the neighborhood's workers and keep them under his thumb.

Shaun and Rebecca are safe for now, but we're still relying on you to find us that Shroud!

Id: [0x000966AC]
Sir! The engines just pulled into Waterloo. Once Starrick's men arrive, they're gonna unload the train.

Id: [0x000966B1]
Not if the train has already left. Assemble a team at Charing Cross. I'll send the engines there for you to recover.

Id: [0x000966B6]
She's a business partner. That's all you need to know.

Id: [0x000966CE]
“My buses are set on fire, my drivers vanish, and my horses are poisoned,” said Miss Attaway. “These are not accidents.”

Id: [0x000966D2]
“It's nonsense,” Mr. Millner began before Mr. Starrick intervened. “What Mr. Millner means to say,” Mr. Starrick said, “is that the Millner Company is proud to provide a reliable service to the people of London. It is unfortunate that Miss Attaway lacks the integrity to admit responsibility for her company's failings and instead chooses to slander our good name.”

Id: [0x0009670A]
No, certainly not! You'd rather return us to the yoke of tyranny?

Welcome, Miss Frye. Do you care to tell me where the Shroud is?

Id: [0x00097581]
As you wish. I shall find it without your help. And then I'll strangle you with it.

Id: [0x00097582]

Id: [0x00099FCA]
Phonetic telegraph? Hmmm, sounds a bit of a mouthful. You could just call it a telephone.

Id: [0x00099FCB]
Telephone. How bizarre! [beat]Anyway, as I was saying earlier, the press has become entirely dependent on the Starrick Telegraph Company.

Id: [0x00099FCC]
Which is why Mr Green has asked you to set up a free line.

Id: [0x00099FCD]
Yes. What is more, other small independent companies have had their lines sabotaged, and they have little means of finding any broken fuses, which are…

Id: [0x00099FCE]
To be found on top of Big Ben.

Id: [0x00099FCF]
Correct. Especially as one needs a special government pass to get through the guards.

Yes, they pulled someone out of that carriage. Dead drunk, he was. They carried him into the church yard. Maybe he wanted a quiet place to sleep it off.

Id: [0x0009A636]
Yeah, I saw them draggin' someone out of the carriage after the wheel fell off. They said he'd hit his head. Not sure why they needed to take him to the church, but that's where they went.

The currency a laughingstock. Inflation out of control. Twopenny brutally murdered.

Id: [0x0009C5E9]
And yet Parliament does nothing.

Id: [0x0009C5EA]
The bill will be defeated, sir. That buffoon Disraeli shall be taken care of. It has been arranged, upon my honor.

Id: [0x0009C5EB]
Your honor carries little weight.

Id: [0x0009C5EC]
How dare you, sir!?

Id: [0x0009C5ED]
The poor people of this city have suffered enough. Today I granted a significant raise to my staff in order to counter inflation.

Id: [0x0009C5EF]
I wonder what they would offer to keep your record out of the newspapers. About the same as Disraeli would offer for your balls, I'd wager. But let's be generous, why limit ourselves to one or the other, when we can have it all? What say you, sir, shall I come collect?

Id: [0x0009C5F1]

I'm sorry sir. She is dead.

We both know that when Abstergo makes big moves, the Templars are up to something.

Id: [0x0009CC6A]
We think they’re hot on the trail of a new Piece of Eden. I’ve got people in London looking for it.

Bio: Benjamin Raffles is one of three Kingpins that Starrick has placed in the Strand district. The Strand, one of the highest guarded districts in London (aside from Westminster) must be kept under strict watch, before all mayhem breaks loose. People live in fear of the tiny, manipulative man who roams the district, keeping an eye on things. He is commonly found by the Thames docks where he meets a lot of clients interested in his protection.

Join me for the finale!

Id: [0x0009EC35]
Jacob, my dear! Where aaaare yooouuu?

Id: [0x0009EC37]
Isn't traveling by rail thrilling? Just look out the window. See all the people and carriages and buildings whizzing by?

Id: [0x0009EC38]
Mmmhmm!

Id: [0x0009EC39]
But you know trains are dangerous, too. One mustn't play too close to the tracks or ZIP! They'll run you right over.

Id: [0x0009EC3B]
Yes, I understand.

Id: [0x0009EC3E]
Oh, where is that conductor? He hasn't taken our tickets.

Id: [0x0009EC3F]
I saw him in the back of the train. He was drinking from a bottle.

Id: [0x0009EC40]
Keep your voice down. I'm... I'm sure he'll be round soon.

Id: [0x0009EC41]
His breath smelled like daddy's.

Id: [0x0009EC42]
That's quite enough from you.

Id: [0x0009EC44]
Now remember... do not speak unless spoken to and keep your hands to yourself. We must make a good appearance or your uncle will disinherit us.

Id: [0x0009EC45]
I'll be a good boy, I promise.

Id: [0x0009EC46]

You wouldn't happen to have seen two carriages pass by here just now?

Id: [0x0009EC5F]
I did, sir. One with a man in it, the other with a woman. They split up.

Id: [0x0009ECB6]
Welcome, sir.

Id: [0x0009ECB7]
Your Highness. What a surprise.

Id: [0x0009ECB8]
Ha, is life not about embracing the unexpected? I shall take but a few moments of your time. A matter of utmost importance must be discussed. When the Commonwealth seized the Punjab from my people--

Id: [0x0009ECB9]
It was not a seizure, but a rightful transaction.

Id: [0x0009ECBA]
Britain promised to protect me. By robbing me of my kingdom, Parliament acted in violation of the treaty signed with my family. Here, read it.

Id: [0x0009ECBB]
I-- I was not aware.

Id: [0x0009ECBC]
Read. That is all I ask. You are one of the few in a position to help.

Id: [0x0009ECBD]
Mr. Singh?

Id: [0x0009ECBE]
I will do what I can.

Id: [0x0009ECDD]
You wound me deeply, sir. My people deserve freedom. I am here to fight for them.

Id: [0x0009ECDE]
Why did you lose the Punjab? I shall tell you, "Your Highness". You were outgunned, outmaneuvered, and simply outclassed. Yes, the Sikhs deserve freedom. I hope with British help and progress, they shall achieve it.

Id: [0x0009ECDF]
Then why do they cry out for their king?

Id: [0x0009ECE0]
Britain has a duty to bring about peace. It is an enormous responsibility, and I value your guidance and advice, along with that of Parliament. But it's our burden to rule India, and certainly not the duty of a forgotten leader who has not seen his country for twenty years. I apologize for being so frank, but one must not tell lies to a king.

Id: [0x0009ECE2]
I'm looking for Miss Hattie Cadwallader.

Id: [0x0009ECE4]
Hey, smallie! Know anything about what happened here?

Id: [0x0009ECE7]
Your honesty is most enlightening.

Id: [0x0009ECE8]
When I become Prime Minister, I intend to push for peace, but it will be a long and slow process. And I am afraid I can almost guarantee you will never see India again.

Id: [0x0009ECE9]
Look sharp, lads. The guv'ner expects trouble tonight.

Id: [0x0009ECEA]
If my people are free, then my imprisonment shall be no burden.

Id: [0x0009ECEB]
Perhaps your idealism is real. Although, after observing the tigers wandering the grounds of your lush, expensive estate, forgive me for doubting it.

Id: [0x0009ECED]
Much luck, Your Highness, with your lobbying. I hope my advice has done some good.

Id: [0x0009ECEE]
Far more than your policies, thus far. But I hold out hope that you will make progress. My people are counting on it.

Good day, Mr. Gladstone.

Id: [0x0009ECF4]
You are a hard man to pin down.

I know what this is about. Your parlor tricks have worn off. Her Majesty has tired of you, so now you come begging for scraps.

Id: [0x0009ECF8]
When the world is full of nasty things, we must tear those things apart.

Id: [0x0009ECF9]
A man like Starrick builds a world around his own desires, so we lose the ability to dream for ourselves. Therefore we must--

Id: [0x0009ECFF]
It's time you returned this carriage and recovered those plans. They are located in Buckingham Palace. The Queen keeps them among her personal papers in the White Drawing Room. I wish you a good evening, Miss Evie Frye.

Id: [0x0009ED00]
Strike.

Id: [0x0009ED02]
Ain’t seen her... I knows what she's been up to, though.

Id: [0x0009ED03]
And what's that?

Id: [0x0009ED04]
Prigging (stealing) art, sir. She pinched a statue not far from here.

Id: [0x0009ED05]
I saw who pinched it, sir.

Id: [0x0009ED06]
Miss Cadwallader?

Id: [0x0009ED07]
She hides down the sewers, sir.

Id: [0x0009ED08]
Someone around here must know Miss Hattie Cadwallader...

Id: [0x0009ED0A]
Now where is that statue...

Id: [0x0009ED0B]
The statue must be around here somewhere...

Id: [0x0009ED0D]
Of course it’s sewers.

Id: [0x0009ED0E]
[sigh]Why the bloody sewers?

Id: [0x0009ED0F]
Spread out and keep vigilant. Master Starrick's orders.

Id: [0x0009ED10]
Keep watch!

Id: [0x0009ED11]
The workers are nearly on duty. Get ready.

Id: [0x0009ED12]
Master Starrick's enemies have been raising hell in the Strand. Don't let them near the workshop.

Id: [0x0009ED13]
The Assassins have been spotted in the Strand. Look lively.

Id: [0x0009ED14]
Keep our enemies away from here.

Id: [0x0009ED15]
Protect the workshop.

Id: [0x0009ED16]
Be wary, the Assassins have struck twice in the Strand.

Id: [0x0009ED17]
Let no one approach. Fire on sight.

Id: [0x0009ED18]
Protect this place with your life.

Id: [0x0009ED19]
Master Starrick believes the Assassins might try to destroy the workshop.

Why, what are you doing here, Your Highness?

Id: [0x0009ED75]
I know how busy your days have been of late. A few moments of your time is all I require.

Id: [0x0009ED76]
This is all rather unorthodox, but continue.

Id: [0x0009ED77]
Britain was to protect me according to the treaty my family signed, instead she took my land. And now I hear Britain intends to strengthen her ties to India. Perhaps it is time to return the Punjab to her people.

Id: [0x0009ED78]
The Queen has supplied you with an annual income for God knows how long, and now you bite the hand that feeds you?

Id: [0x0009ED79]
It is not a matter of money. I cannot stand idle and watch my homeland subjected to the yoke of an outsider's rule. My people are treated as slaves. I will die poor a thousand times over if only to see them free.

Id: [0x0009ED7A]
Your passion moves me, Your Highness. What would you have me do?

Id: [0x0009ED7B]
Take this copy of the wrongful treaty and defend my claim to the throne. Help disengage the Punjab from British rule.

Id: [0x0009ED7C]
I shall speak up, but I am only one voice. I cannot promise anything but a show of support.

Id: [0x0009ED7D]
That is more than enough. Thank you, sir.

Id: [0x0009ED7E]
My pleasure, Your Highness.

Hello. Hi. Shaun Hastings here. Just popping in a moment to remind you that you've got a rare opportunity here to really live the past. The sights, the sounds, the smells, the tastes....

Id: [0x0009F3E2]
And on the subject of taste, I can't help noticing you've wandered into a pub. Did you know Victorian London was home to almost four thousand pubs? Fascinating, I know. And most of those pubs brewed their own beer.

Id: [0x0009F3E3]
I've just had a thought. If you were to, say, sample your ancestor's memories of some lovely beverages, Rebecca could process those DNA strings and make them available to other users. Purely for archival purposes, of course.

Id: [0x0009F3E4]
What he's saying is he wants you to drink old booze and email the taste sensation to him. And somehow he's roped me into helping him do it.

Id: [0x0009F3E5]
This is a legitimate historical inquiry!

Hey, if you want a digital baby-birding from the recruit, I'm not going to stop you. In fact, I'd rather not get anywhere near that.

So you learnt to communicate with your mother through vibrations.

Id: [0x0009F8C2]
Oh, no. I have my pupils, my studies, and most of all, my work.

Id: [0x0009F8C6]
Do you think your work will get done faster if you start coughing up blood?

Id: [0x0009F8C7]
You sound like Mother. She's always telling me to take Cammomilla before bedtime and Belladona upon getting up. Honestly, I am a grown man.

Id: [0x0009F8C9]
That’s because she loves you. My mother died when I was young. So I suppose I'm quite envious of your relationship. You ought to be grateful you still have her.

Id: [0x0009F8CA]
Oh, I am and she is a remarkable woman. She has overcome her handicap and even put it to her advantage. Indeed, she is the only wife in our street not to have been taken in by foolish tittle-tattle about that soothing syrup.

Id: [0x0009F8CB]
I see you love her too, Aleck. So don’t let her mourn another son.

Ah, Jacob, I was reading a letter from my father. He's still in Canada. He has it into his head that the climate over there is far better.

Id: [0x0009F8DA]
Perhaps it is. Can’t be any worse than London drizzle, can it?

Id: [0x0009F8DB]
I dare say. What worries me, is when ideas crop up in his mind, they often end up hatching. And then he will blaze ahead without a thought to ask if others would actually like to follow.

Id: [0x0009F8DC]
A man of action. I can sympathize, my father had a strong character too.

Id: [0x0009F8DD]
When he uprooted us from Edinburgh to take over grandfather’s practice, he did not think to ask if we agreed.

Id: [0x0009F8DE]
But do you regret the move now?

Id: [0x0009F8E0]
Not as such.

Id: [0x0009F8E1]
There you are then, can’t be all bad.

Id: [0x0009F8E2]
I would have liked to have completed my studies. And if father comes back venting the wonders of the new world, I know where he'll be leading.

Id: [0x0009F8E3]
At least it’ll get you out of the stink! Anyway, have you seen Green?

Id: [0x0009F8E8]
Bully for him!

Id: [0x0009F8E9]
He has thus entered his second marriage union. [a beat]I was thinking about my own life. It does seem empty in comparison.

Id: [0x0009F8EA]
Aleck, may I remind you, you are still-a-young-man. How old?

Id: [0x0009F8EB]
Twenty-one already, Evie, and I still haven’t got a degree. It is frightening, and I am still single.

Id: [0x0009F8EE]
My brother Melly, who is only a few years older than I, has succeeded in everything. His family, his practice in Edinburgh, his patents...

Id: [0x0009F8EF]
And tuberculosis may sweep it all away tomorrow. So stop worrying about the flight of time and other people’s successes. Just focus on your own objectives.

Id: [0x0009F8F0]
You mean my speaking telegraph?

Id: [0x0009F8F1]
Telephone, Aleck, te-le-phone. Rolls off the tongue better. Repeat, te-le-phone.

Id: [0x0009F8F2]
Te-le-phone. Telephone. [a beat]Still sounds bizarre though.

Id: [0x0009F8F4]
Ah, Jacob, I thought I would measure some vibrations.

Id: [0x0009F8F5]
You mean you said to yourself, "oh goodoh, I’ll just measure some vibrations".

Id: [0x0009F8F6]
Yes, don’t you?

Id: [0x0009F8F7]
No, Aleck, I do not.

Id: [0x0009F8F8]
That is because you haven’t devised a number of instruments with stretched membranes pulled across them.

Id: [0x0009F8F9]
No. Despite appearances I do not enjoy relieving cats of their gut.

Id: [0x0009F8FA]
Neither do I, I prefer to go to the butcher’s, and we don’t use cats, by the way. Anyway, by seeing which membrane quivers on producing a particular sound, I can identify and reproduce a whole array sounds.

Id: [0x0009F8FB]
Amazing, you’ll be forming a cat’s chorus next!

Id: [0x0009F8FD]
I can thus teach deaf people how to speak. I simply help them identify the sound vibrations. Then, I show them how to shape their mouths using Father’s Visible Speech diagrams.

Id: [0x0009F8FE]
Sounds edifying. Sincerely, it is a worthy cause to help the deaf and the dumb.

Id: [0x0009F8FF]
I dream of freedom of speech for all people, Jacob. That includes the hard of hearing, and my dear deaf mother.

Id: [0x0009F900]
Sorry, Aleck, I forgot she was deaf.

Deaf but certainly not dumb!

Ah, Jacob. I was miles away.

Id: [0x0009F904]
Caught you in the moon again!

Id: [0x0009F905]
What? Oh. I was just reflecting on the sun, actually. Or more precisely, its light. I was thinking that if waves of sound can be conveyed by electrical means, then why can’t they be conveyed via light too?

Id: [0x0009F906]
You mean messages sent along sunbeams?

Id: [0x0009F907]
Sort of. Via a kind of optical telegraph, a photophone.

Id: [0x0009F908]
Have you been smoking down the dens in Limehouse, Aleck?

Id: [0x0009F909]
I certainly have not.

Id: [0x0009F90C]
Perhaps the day will come when the man at the telephone will be able to see the distant person to whom he is speaking.

Id: [0x0009F90D]
You are a dreamer, Aleck.

Id: [0x0009F90E]
Do not all of man’s inventions come from a fancy, an idea?

At some point you’ve still got to put words into action, though. I suggest you get your telephone sorted first, while the likes of me plough the fields of justice and freedom.

Yes, I’m sorry. [a beat]Then it is probably due to over work. If you overstretch yourself your body is bound to retaliate.

Id: [0x0009F917]
You sound like Mother again. She is worried I’ll end up in Highgate cemetery with Ed. Consequently father’s been threatening to take us all to Canada. He says the air there is healthier.

Look on the bright side, think of all the accents you’ll be able to correct!

Id: [0x0009F929]
Your work can follow you wherever you go. [a beat]Listen, Aleck, some people don't embrace change easily, and yet they excel when it is imposed upon them. Perhaps you are one of those.

Id: [0x0009F92A]
How can you imply I reject change when I am possessed by the spirit of invention?

Id: [0x0009F92B]
But even the spirit of invention needs a favorable environment to flourish. My father used to say it is sometimes necessary to carry ones banner to a more advantageous battlefield in order to win the day. And that includes a place where you are less likely to fall sick.

I would rather find investors here, thank you very much.

Sometimes you have to go where fortune favors the brave, do you not? That is, if you are so intent on realizing your telephone.

It still makes me wonder how such an oddly named device could exist. "Speaking telegraph" at least has the merit of being clearly understood by the masses.

Id: [0x0009F935]
I should think Samuel Morse had the same doubts when he invented the recording telegraph. And now look, it has become a part of everyday vocabulary. To say nothing of Volta.

Id: [0x0009F936]
Yes, they are thinking of naming the unit of electromotive force in his name.

I don’t. I attend them. I am trying to study for a degree. Perhaps then my projects shall be taken seriously.

You don’t need a degree for that, Aleck.

Id: [0x0009F948]
But one cannot live with ones parents forever? Nor can one always count on a friend’s benevolence, even though I am truly grateful that Henry has allowed me to use these premises.

Id: [0x0009F949]
If people are prepared to help you it means they believe in you. It would be bad manners to turn them off because of self-centeredness.

Id: [0x0009F94A]
I suppose you must be right. Miss Eccleston, my teacher friend, appears to come to the same conclusion.

Id: [0x0009F94B]
There you are then.

Perhaps that is why I desperately want to bring my telephone to life… It will be my way of reaching out to the world.

Which is why I joined 'The Ghost Club', the first society in the world to look systematically at the phenomenon.

Id: [0x0009FD4D]
Approach.

Id: [0x0009FD51]
You have honored us with your loyalty and courage. Long may we strengthen the Empire together!

Id: [0x0009FD53]
Your Majesty. We will always work to ensure the safety of the people.

Id: [0x0009FD54]
But with the greatest respect, our philosophy forbids us from assisting with the expansion of the Empire.

Id: [0x0009FD55]
Perhaps, ma'am, you could consider putting an end to your imperialist desires?

Id: [0x0009FD57]
I understand and respect your position, bound as you are by your Creed.

You will indulge me one final time and receive these gifts.

I don't suppose you'll be offered any more cake.

What's the trouble?

Id: [0x0009FD63]
It isn't trouble so much as disappointment.

Id: [0x0009FD66]
Lovely day, this is! Wouldn't you agree?

I suppose.

Id: [0x0009FD6C]
Go on.

Id: [0x0009FD6D]
It's just always the same here. Day in and day out. Gray in the morning. Gray in the afternoon. Gray in the evening. A touch of sun if we're lucky. But never more than a touch. It's all starting to make me feel a bit, I don't know, bogged down.

Id: [0x0009FD6E]
Come now! It isn't ALWAYS gray.

Id: [0x0009FD6F]
True. Sometimes it rains.

Id: [0x0009FD70]
And sometimes the sun shines and birds sing. I'd say often, even! More than you're willing to admit, I think.

Id: [0x0009FD71]
We visited Spain once, when I was young. Barcelona. And that city shines all hours of the day. A more pleasant place you couldn't imagine!

So you take a bit o' gammon, an you rubs it on the wart, at the waning of the moon, mind. And then you buries it in the garden. It's a certain cure.

Id: [0x0009FD9A]
See, I'd heard that you can use a dishrag, rather than gammon but you absolutely must bury it near a crossroads at night.

Id: [0x0009FDB0]
Aah. So why not use gammon AND the crossroads AND the waning moon? Just to be on the safe side.

Id: [0x0009FDB1]
Hmm, could do.

However, I would very much appreciate it if you would accompany me.

Id: [0x000A236A]
Number fifty Berkeley Square: four storeys high, and branded: "BEWARE ALL THOSE WHO ENTER". There have been many strange tales of this dreadful domicile.

Id: [0x000A236B]
The earliest report of a haunting was said to be the specter of a small girl who was murdered by a servant.

Id: [0x000A236C]
She could be seen at the attic windows, weeping and wringing her little hands in an agony of despair.

Id: [0x000A236E]
Shall we?

Id: [0x000A2370]
Another legend claims the attic is haunted by the spirit of a young woman, who purportedly threw herself from the top floor windows to escape her abusive uncle.

Id: [0x000A2371]
Her screaming ghost has reportedly been sighted hanging from the window ledge.

Id: [0x000A2372]
This residence was briefly owned by a Mr. James Jasper. A choirmaster and an opium addict. His nephew, Edward, was betrothed to one of Mr. Jasper’s pupils, the fair and delicate Rose.

Id: [0x000A2373]
However, Edward disappeared under mysterious circumstances, followed by Jasper himself.

Id: [0x000A2374]
Perhaps grief sent him back to the soothing arms of his narcotic mistress.

Id: [0x000A2375]
Though this house is vacant, some say it comes alive at night with screams of terror, ringing bells, and slamming shutters.

Id: [0x000A2376]
There are claims that a young man was caged in the attic, his only connection to the rest of the world a tiny hole in the door – a young man who was reduced to madness by this extreme isolation.

Id: [0x000A2377]
The legends all seem to focus on one room in particular.

Id: [0x000A2379]
My word.

Id: [0x000A237A]
Perhaps... perhaps I shall wait here while you investigate the source of that laughter, which is not at all unsettling!

Id: [0x000A239E]
Alas, the myth has been discredited. There was no ghost in Berkeley Square.

Id: [0x000A239F]
Just a wretched soul, driven to murder and madness by guilt and intoxication.

Id: [0x000A23A6]

Id: [0x000A23B1]
What's that man done?

Id: [0x000A23B3]
Robbed the pawnbroker's down the road.

Id: [0x000A23BF]
Who do you think made you do this?

Id: [0x000A23C1]
Let’s pretend that I believe you. Tell me who made you do it.

Id: [0x000A23C3]
All I can recall is a silver watch, swinging in mid-air. It was held by someone, – or some thing! A dark presence whispering. I could only see its eyes. A demon!

Id: [0x000A23C6]
Maybe the shopkeeper will make more sense.

Id: [0x000A23C7]
I’ll need to verify this with the shopkeeper.

Id: [0x000A23CF]
May I ask you about the robbery?

Id: [0x000A23D1]
What can you tell me about the robbery?

Id: [0x000A23DA]
There's not much to say. Most of the items did come from the same seller. Enzio Capelli, sorcerer supreme, a famous showman, from Italy. Several weeks ago he was forced to pawn his family heirlooms. Debts.

Id: [0x000A23E2]
I have the address of the last person who redeemed something of his. A lovely pearl necklace. That helpful?

Id: [0x000A23E3]
I should say so. Ta.

Id: [0x000A23E4]

My only lead is this mysterious buyer.

Id: [0x000A2415]
Yes. I want to give you the necklace now.

It's said to heal the sick - popular myth is that it brings people back from the dead, but the Assassin records say that's not true. I've never heard of one being in London, though. Do you really think Edward Kenway could have found one?

Id: [0x000A6019]
He travelled extensively, so it's  possible. But if he did, he kept it a closely-guarded secret.

Id: [0x000A601A]
But if it's true - what a find it would be.

Id: [0x000A601B]
Indeed. I'm eager to find out, myself.

Id: [0x000A601E]
Yes, I suppose we'd better hurry!

Id: [0x000A601F]
Have you been taking driving lessons from your brother?

Id: [0x000A6020]
Perhaps we could slow down a little?

Id: [0x000A6021]
Well. This is certainly refreshing!

Id: [0x000A6022]
But if Miss Thorne thinks the Shroud could still be there...

Id: [0x000A6023]
If there's a vault, the Templars haven't found it yet.

Id: [0x000A6027]
That's all for the men out here. What's next?

Id: [0x000A6028]
Miss Thorne wants me captured. If she sees me in chains, she might let her guard down.

Id: [0x000A6029]
Can you make it look convincing?

Id: [0x000A602A]
You mean pretend like you're my prisoner? I'll do my best, ma'am.

EXt. WHITECHAPEL - DAY.

Id: [0x000A605C]
Ah! This is one that's most promising!

Id: [0x000A605D]
An important detective is missing! Skullduggery is surely afoot!

Id: [0x000A605E]
Solve it, and I'll write it up quick as you please!

Id: [0x000A605F]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - DAY.

Id: [0x000A6061]
He's a friend of mine. The whole station is out looking for him as we speak. Ironically, he came here on an investigation himself—seems several people have gone missing in this part of town.

Id: [0x000A6062]
We've had reports of missing people over the last few months. Detective Murphy is just the most recent and the only one who's anybody to speak of.

Id: [0x000A6063]
I just saw him in front of his house.  He was very upset to learn that Detective Murphy is now missing.

Id: [0x000A6069]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - STREETS - DAY.

Id: [0x000A606B]
Where the hell did he get to then?

Id: [0x000A606F]
An odd sort of detective who gets lost!

Id: [0x000A6071]
He's probably got pie-eyed and run off somewheres.

Id: [0x000A6073]
Good ol' Detective Murphy. Must be about someplace.

Id: [0x000A6075]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - BAKERY - DAY.

Id: [0x000A6078]
He was in here askin' about missing people. Bought a meat pie, he did. Stayed and chatted for a few minutes, then headed off to the barber.

Id: [0x000A607B]
George delivers meat for my pies. Lovely lad. I pay on delivery. I believe he picks it up from the local butcher shop.

Id: [0x000A607E]
I'm told that some people have gone missing, but I don't know anything about it.

Id: [0x000A607F]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - FlORISTS - DAY.

Id: [0x000A6082]
I saw him going into the barber shop when I was on my way to work.

Id: [0x000A6085]
In this kind of neighborhood, people come and go.

Id: [0x000A6088]
George is my sweetheart. I think he plans to propose marriage soon, maybe even today!

Id: [0x000A6089]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - FlORISTS - DAY.

Id: [0x000A608C]
An odd man, indeed. He spent a fair amount of time in here, poking around.

Id: [0x000A608F]
Some people around town just seem to vanish. It is mysterious.

Id: [0x000A6092]
Sweet boy. Constantly giving my assistant gifts. A jacket, a handbag and so on.

Id: [0x000A6094]
George delivers that to us. It's amazing—the flowers just grow and grow!

Id: [0x000A6096]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - Barber - DAY.

Id: [0x000A6099]
Yeh, I gave him a trim. He asked no end of questions. When I cut his hair, I notices a tattoo right at the base of his neck. A green celtic cross, it was.

Id: [0x000A609C]
You're right. Several people have disappeared over the past months. Some of 'em were customers of mine!

Id: [0x000A609F]
George was in here earlier, gettin' a haircut. He wanted to look nice for his girl. He's been seeing Joanna from the flower shop for some time now. Said he's finally saved up enough money to pop the question.

Id: [0x000A60A2]
I'm tryin' to quit drinking. Sometimes my hand shakes when I'm giving a shave.

Id: [0x000A60A3]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - LEATHERWORKERS - DAY.

Id: [0x000A60A6]
He came in asking lots of questions. I believe I answered them to his satisfaction.

Id: [0x000A60A9]
I suppose there are a few people I haven't seen in a while.

Id: [0x000A60AC]
Why would you want to know about him? Stupid boy. He does deliver tanned leather on occasion, but I really have very little to do with him.

Id: [0x000A60AF]
He was coming too close to figuring out where all those people went! Ha! They got parceled out to the baker, the florist and me!

Id: [0x000A60B0]
EXt. WHITECHAPEL - Butchers - DAY.

Id: [0x000A60B3]
You mean the annoying bloke nosing around? I told 'im to sod off.

Id: [0x000A60BD]
I pride meself on the quality of the beef I sell. Somebody selling cheap around here though, my sales have dropped off.

Id: [0x000A60BE]
George? I don't know any George.

Id: [0x000A60C2]
You're having a laugh!

Id: [0x000A60C5]
I'm just one woman. How could I have gotten rid of all those bodies? Excuse me, I think I'm going to be sick. I've just thought.... how exactly did they get rid of the bodies?

Id: [0x000A60C8]
I'm just a flower-girl. I wouldn't harm anyone! Besides, George has disappeared and I'm worried sick.

Id: [0x000A60CA]
I'd never hurt so much as a fly!

Id: [0x000A60CD]
All I did was give him a haircut! Nothing wrong with that!

Id: [0x000A60CE]
EXT. LONDON STEETS

Id: [0x000A60CF]
You very cleverly puzzled that one out! A very unpleasant crime. Perfect for one of Mr. Raymond's penny dreadfuls!

Id: [0x000A60D0]
EXT. STRAND

Id: [0x000A60D1]
My write-up of that last crime was so ingenious that Purlock Publishing tossed me quite a tidy sum! I believe this next one will do even better!

Id: [0x000A60D2]
It's baffling. The room was locked! How did the murderer get in and out?

Id: [0x000A60D3]
INT. CASHAN's ROOM

Id: [0x000A60D4]
I'm just the housekeeper, but Mr. Cashan was a dear friend. Each morning I bring him his coffee. Today his door was locked shut. My husband is the caretaker, we live downstairs. We have the keys to all the apartments, so after knocking, I became concerned and let myself in, and found him like this![cries]

Id: [0x000A60DA]
The lights weren't working. My husband didn't want to waste any candles, so we retired early.

Id: [0x000A60DD]
Mr. Cashan is… was a respected music critic. A very accomplished man.

Id: [0x000A60E0]
It's true! I loved him! He was the best thing that ever happened to me! [weeps]

Id: [0x000A60E3]
I loved the man passionately! I had every hope we would run off together![short sob]

Id: [0x000A60E5]
INT. HENMAN'S ROOM

Id: [0x000A60E8]
Mr. Cashan's dead?! Difficult to believe—he led a quiet life. Out at concerts most nights, shut up in his room writing the rest of the time. He must have been a lonely man. My wife felt sorry for him and helped him as often as she could.

Id: [0x000A60EB]
I'm in charge of the running and upkeep of the whole building. So I can get dirty now and then. I was just doing some work in the basement.

Id: [0x000A60EE]
I forgot to put it away after I fixed Mr. Golden's music stand yesterday morning. I left it there and he came to give it back.

Id: [0x000A60F1]
The gas quit working yesterday. I don't know enough to fix such things safely myself. A man from the company is going to come by tomorrow.

Id: [0x000A60F4]
I never had any problem with the man. ... What? With my wife!? That bastard!

Id: [0x000A60F6]
INT. Golden'S ROOM

Id: [0x000A60F9]
I work very late, so did he. I only met him once or twice in the two years I've been living here!

Id: [0x000A60FC]
I was out giving a benefit recital for unemployed musicians. Several dozen people can attest to my whereabouts.

Id: [0x000A60FF]
I use them to create an ambience when I hold private recitals.

Id: [0x000A6105]
He destroyed an entire orchestra! All those musicians put out of work. A rancorous old man who had no talent or creativity of his own!

Id: [0x000A6107]
INT. BLOOMFIELD's ROOM

Id: [0x000A610A]
Gone just like that, eh? He lived right next door and often came home from his concerts a bit drunk and singing at the top of his lungs. Drove my wife near crazy.

Id: [0x000A610D]
I was down in the cellar, fiddling with my experiments.

Id: [0x000A6110]
Ah, yes. Be careful with that, it can be dangerous. It reacts badly with heat.

Id: [0x000A6113]
I was down in the cellar, fiddling with my experiments. In any case, why on earth would I want to kill that old sod?

Id: [0x000A6117]
I'm an amateur chemist. Henman let me set up a few experiments in the cellar.

Id: [0x000A611A]
That belongs to Mr. Golden. He's an awfully nice chap. We let him use our apartment during the day, when my wife and I are out, tending our shop. He likes to rehearse here, where the light's better.

Id: [0x000A611D]
Cashan had an eye for the ladies, no question. I was a bit jealous of him, frankly.

Id: [0x000A611E]
INT. BLOOMFIELD's ROOM

Id: [0x000A6121]
Mr. Cashan is dead? I just saw him yesterday! He looked in the peak of health. If you ask me, he paid a bit too much attention to the caretaker's wife. Scandalous, really. They must have seen each other nearly every day.

Id: [0x000A6124]
Last night I was knitting in that chair. Then I felt a quite sickly and opened the window to clear my head. I certainly didn't hear anything.

Id: [0x000A6127]
When the lights quit working yesterday, that sweet Mr. Golden handed out candles to everyone. He such a nice man.

Id: [0x000A6132]
I was sick all evening and could barely breathe, let alone kill a man twice my size.

Id: [0x000A6152]
I worry that any agitation will incite terrible violence, so please remove trouble makers without attracting any attention.

Id: [0x000A6169]
These people are tired of living under your boot heel!

Id: [0x000A616B]
You're a bully, Mr. Strain.

Id: [0x000A616D]
And I find I'm not over-fond of bullies.

Id: [0x000A6180]
The best laid plans…

We're under attack! Cast off!

Full steam! We have to get away!

We're halfway to our destination, captain!

Half our journey's done, sir!

Halfway there, captain!

Id: [0x000A61C0]
Almost there, captain!

Destination in sight, sir!

Id: [0x000A61C2]
We'll be arriving shortly, captain!

Id: [0x000A61C9]
Help! We're under attack!

Id: [0x000A61CA]
Alarm! Protect the cargo!

Id: [0x000A61CB]
Over there! Keep them off me!

Id: [0x000A61F2]
Oh, you are a one!

Id: [0x000A61F4]
Yes, yes I am.

Id: [0x000A61F9]
Oh, come off it, you flirt!

Id: [0x000A61FB]
Stop being so beautiful, then.

Id: [0x000A6222]
...I'm happy to oblige.

Id: [0x000A6223]
Well... my room is just round the corner.

Id: [0x000A6225]
If that would interest you.

Id: [0x000A6227]
What in the world?

Id: [0x000A6229]
What is that? Help me take a look.

Id: [0x000A622B]
What do you see?[laugh]

Id: [0x000A622D]
Not a thing. Too distracted by them strong arms of yours.

Id: [0x000A622F]
Look there!

Id: [0x000A6231]
What? What do you see? Here, hold me up.

Id: [0x000A6233]
Can you see anything?

Id: [0x000A6235]
Hmm? Oh, sorry luv. That was just a cunning wheeze to get your arms around me.

Id: [0x000A6236]
Were your parents bad at driving by any chance?

Id: [0x000A6238]
Oh dear!

Id: [0x000A623A]
I cannot die here, I have too much work to do!

Id: [0x000A623C]
This is not how I imagined my death.

Id: [0x000A623E]
Horses did not evolve to endure this kind of treatment!

Id: [0x000A6241]
Is this honestly what it feels like when I arrest someone?

Id: [0x000A6243]
There's no need for such brutality!

Id: [0x000A6245]
What do you want from me?

Id: [0x000A6248]
Just need you to answer some questions.

Id: [0x000A624A]
I need you to be honest with a friend of mine.

Id: [0x000A624D]
You're a brash one, aren't you?

Id: [0x000A6250]
It's been said.

Id: [0x000A6252]
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Id: [0x000A6255]
That's it!

Id: [0x000A6257]
You're in for it now!

Id: [0x000A6259]
Help! Police! Help police!

Id: [0x000A625B]
I need immediate assistance!

Id: [0x000A625D]
Oh blast! Not again!

Id: [0x000A625F]
You can't do this! I'm a policeman!

Id: [0x000A6263]
Stop! In the name of the law!

Id: [0x000A6265]
I wish all police were as funny as you.

Id: [0x000A6267]
Is this really how a policeman should carry himself?

Id: [0x000A6269]
Honestly, I expected more from your profession.

Id: [0x000A626D]
Hands off!

Id: [0x000A626F]
Are you mad?

Id: [0x000A6271]
You're making a big mistake!

Id: [0x000A6273]
Where did you come from?

Id: [0x000A6275]
That's very painful!

Id: [0x000A6277]
My arm doesn't work like that!

Id: [0x000A6279]
Ow! Owwww!

Id: [0x000A627B]
Let me go!

Id: [0x000A627D]
If any of my friends see you, we'll start shooting!

Id: [0x000A6280]
YOU didn't see me. I doubt your friends will either.

Id: [0x000A6282]
It'll all be over in the blink of an eye.

Id: [0x000A6285]
You can't get all of us!

Id: [0x000A6288]
Oh, yes I can.

Id: [0x000A628A]
You just worry about you.

Id: [0x000A628D]
This crowd's a powderkeg, and I'm the fuse!

Id: [0x000A6290]
Well, I'm the—oh, shut up.

Id: [0x000A6292]
How very poetic.

Id: [0x000A6295]
Go on, cause a fuss, give us a reason to kill Marx.

Id: [0x000A6297]
I think taking you out quickly and quietly will do nicely.

Id: [0x000A6299]
I prefer a more sublte approach.

Id: [0x000A629C]
I'll make you pay!

Id: [0x000A629E]
Why did you have to ruin everything?

Id: [0x000A62A0]
Keep back!

Id: [0x000A62A2]
You can't stop us!

Id: [0x000A62A4]
Watch out for that one there!

Id: [0x000A62A6]
Help! An anarchist!

Id: [0x000A62A8]
Is that person covered in weapons?

Id: [0x000A62AA]
This one's trouble!

Id: [0x000A62AC]
Not again!

Id: [0x000A62AE]
What a lousy day.

Id: [0x000A62B0]
I should have just made a run for it.

Id: [0x000A62B2]
No! NO!

Id: [0x000A62B6]
Why do they always run?

Id: [0x000A62B8]
It can never be easy, can it?

Id: [0x000A62BA]
Not the brightest of the bunch, are you?

Id: [0x000A62BC]
Here we go again.

Id: [0x000A62C0]
No mere Assassin can stop me!

Id: [0x000A62C2]
I demand to be released!

Id: [0x000A62C4]
I suppose you'll kill me now!

Id: [0x000A62C6]
Torture me all you like!

Id: [0x000A62C9]
We'll meet again, Assassin!

Id: [0x000A62CB]
A new age for the Templar Order begins now!

Id: [0x000A62CD]
Assist me!

Id: [0x000A62CF]
There's an Assassin over here!

Id: [0x000A62D1]
This is not how I envisoned my reign as Grand Master.

Id: [0x000A62D3]
I hate Assassins so much.

Id: [0x000A62D7]
May the Father of Understanding guide you!

Id: [0x000A62D9]
You're my favorite Templar!

Id: [0x000A62DB]
Are you the best the Order has to offer?

Id: [0x000A62DD]
You are the worst Templar I have ever encountered!

Id: [0x000A6372]
I've got mackerel, beautiful mackerel! Just caught today... <LF>

Id: [0x000A6374]
And if that don't please you, I've  some trout, just off the boat.

Id: [0x000A6376]
Drat them flies! Shoo!

Id: [0x000A6386]
Come and buy. Best in the market.

Id: [0x000A6388]
All large and tasty! Fresh whiting, two a penny!

Id: [0x000A638A]
It's a bargain!

Id: [0x000A638C]
And lots more where that came from!

Id: [0x000A6390]
Tonight, then?

Id: [0x000A6394]
That's what makes it fun.

Id: [0x000A6398]
[coy laughter]

Id: [0x000A63CC]
Look at this trout. And Yarmouth bloaters! Perfect for making kedgeree! Delicious!

Id: [0x000A63CE]
Fresh trout! Fresh trout here!

Id: [0x000A63D2]
Haddock, trout... buy our flounder. Whatever you need! <LF>

Id: [0x000A63D4]
Penny a pair!

Id: [0x000A63D6]
Shoo, shoo...

Id: [0x000A63DC]
Let me see... yes,I reckon it'll serve.

Id: [0x000A63DE]
You like how I set that up for you?

Id: [0x000A63DF]
Damn. My back do ache...

Id: [0x000A63E3]
Look at this fresh, beautiful fish. Beautiful trout, fresh as fresh haddock.

Id: [0x000A63E9]
Oh come on! [tempting]My mother won't be home for hours...

Id: [0x000A63EB]

I heard a splash an’ right quick pulled this bloke out a’ the shallows. Dead as a mackerel.

I live there, now. If you can call it livin'. I lost my job, didn’t I? No need for the likes of me when a machine can do the work.

Id: [0x000A63FB]
A nice, warm coat like that on a dead man, what do you expect? I snatched it afore somebody else come along to nick it. Like you!

Id: [0x000A63FE]
I nicked a coat and some things. But I'm a god-fearin' man!

Nothing unusual. Couple of passengers came in and had a sort of business meeting. One of 'em was buying a lot of drinks for the other, and then they started to argue. But Vivian went over and joshed them out of it.

Id: [0x000A641C]
Peter? Nice bloke. Came here after being sacked from a foundry a few months ago. I'll tell you, he looked white as a ghost after he served the businessmen.

Id: [0x000A641F]
She’s a frequent passenger, that one. Hangs about with the wealthier sort. Likes to ‘entertain’ ‘em, if you take my meanin’.

Id: [0x000A6422]
Yeah, I help Vivian fleece the dupes. I slipped a pill in the wine for the table. Both gents got sleepy, but Vivian picked the richest one.

Id: [0x000A6425]
Oh, er – well, it’s a noisy train. Plenty of passengers have trouble getting to sleep, so I keep a sedative here behind the bar. Yeah?

Id: [0x000A6428]
I may help Vivian fleece the odd duck, but I’m no murderer.

Id: [0x000A642A]
INT. TRAIN - DINING CAR

Id: [0x000A642D]
Nothing unusual at all! I had a drink with some gents and then retired to my sleeper.

Id: [0x000A6430]
Someone slipped a note under my sleeper door a few minutes before midnight. It said I should come to the dining car. I went, but only Ryan and Wolf’s man were there and they were both drunk.

Id: [0x000A6436]
Oh, all right. I flirt with rich blokes and the barman slips ‘em a mickey. I take ‘em back to my sleeper and they nod off before I have to do anything shameful. They wake up thinkin’ they had a night o’ fun and hand me a few quid. That’s what happened with Mr. Killian, but he was gone when I come back from looking for the man who left the note.

Id: [0x000A643E]
The rich fella? I did talk with him. Very charming, but a single woman has to be careful, you know. Did something happen to him?

Id: [0x000A643F]
I’m just tryin’ to get by, you know? Flirt with rich blokes, they have themselves a nice time, then nod off. Where’s the harm in that?

Id: [0x000A6478]
CINEMATIC – INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

Id: [0x000A6479]
Ah! Thank you kindly! I was in ever such a squeaky fix, when- what do you know- you rescue me.

Id: [0x000A647A]
Where is the hidden laboratory?

Id: [0x000A647B]
Untie me and then we can parley, m'lady.

Id: [0x000A647D]
I'm pressed for time. Tell me now.

Id: [0x000A647E]
It's underground. Requires a key. One of the guards nicked mine, cheeky sod.

Id: [0x000A647F]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000A6481]
Eh, now untie me?

Id: [0x000A6482]
You got yourself in. I trust you can get yourself out again.

Id: [0x000A6484]
Not to worry, m'lady. Can still recall a couple of tricks from my carnival days.

Id: [0x000A6485]
Charming.

Id: [0x000A6488]
I have several offals (baskets) full. Come and buy. <LF>

Id: [0x000A6489]
Don't mind the flies. It's just the weather. And they add flavor!

Id: [0x000A64C2]
Oh it will, will it?

INT. TRAIN - DINING CAR

Id: [0x000A64CE]
It was a typical evening. As far as I knew, nothing unusual happened until you came aboard with this story of a murder.

Id: [0x000A64DC]
Just another wealthy passenger. They’re all pretty much the same.

Id: [0x000A64DD]
I was tidying up in the passenger car. Around midnight, Vivian ran through – she thought someone was looking for her.

Id: [0x000A64DE]
She rides the train often. She’s very friendly with the other passengers.

Id: [0x000A64DF]
I gave him what he deserved. The man was heartless.

Id: [0x000A64E0]
INT. TRAIN - PASSENGER CAR

Id: [0x000A64E3]
Odd thing was, some noises on the roof woke me up briefly. You say someone was thrown from up there? You'd have to be a very strong fellow to drag someone up onto the roof!

Id: [0x000A64E6]
Oh, Peter worked with me at the foundry. He’s a very strong bloke. I got me arm mangled in one of the damned machines they put in. Then Killian sacked the whole crew. Peter, he helped me get hired as train staff.

Id: [0x000A64E9]
Killian was on this train? Gor, I used to work at his foundry. I never even seen him. None a' us workers ever knew what he looked like.

Id: [0x000A64EC]
That one! Clever little minx. She and the barman got a little scam goin’. I think everyone on staff knows about it.

Id: [0x000A64EF]
I’ve a mangled arm! How’m I going to heft a drugged man to the top of a train?

Id: [0x000A64F2]
Vivian had another of her dupes in her compartment by then. After that, I remember people going past me from time to time, but I was half-asleep.

Id: [0x000A64F7]
INT. TRAIN - SLEEPER CAR

Id: [0x000A64FA]
I had drinks in the dining car with Killian. We had business dealings in the past. It was a pleasant surprise to discover him on this train.

Id: [0x000A64FD]
I suppose there were some disagreements, but there always are when a great deal of money is involved.

Id: [0x000A6519]
[quiet weeping]

Id: [0x000A651E]
You mean the young lady? She and Killian hit it off famously. Embarrassing, really.

Id: [0x000A651F]
I felt unusually tired and came back here to get some sleep.

Id: [0x000A6520]
Sam? He’s a trusted valet. He’s terrifically strong, which makes him useful in many situations.

Id: [0x000A6522]
I had hoped to get him drunk enough that he would miss his meeting, but then the woman spirited him away and I was too tired to do anything about it.

Id: [0x000A6528]
INT. TRAIN - SLEEPER CAR

Id: [0x000A652B]
Mr. Wolf had a few with Mr. Killian. Then the young lady invited herself over to have a glass with ‘em.

Id: [0x000A652E]
Mr. Wolf bought him drink after drink. Then they got angry. But the young lady come over and it's obvious that Mr. Killian was interested in a rendez-vous, like. Around about eleven-thirty, Killian and her left together.

Id: [0x000A6531]
I been Mr. Wolf's valet for goin' on several years. He's frail and needs a man like me to help him about.

Id: [0x000A6534]
Mr. Wolf became terribly tired even though he'd only had one drink. He toddled off to bed well before midnight. I stayed in the dining car for a few drinks with the barman.

Id: [0x000A653A]
I was in the dining car, carousing with the barman. He's a good bloke.

Id: [0x000A653C]
[Grunt]

Id: [0x000A655E]
I'm never drunk, mate, so long as I can hold onto a single blade of grass and not fall off the face of the earth!

Id: [0x000A6572]
I confess, for a time, I thought to return to my pure, organic form. To rejoin my Aita and restore him. To make what once was be again. To... But enough. Enough lore. Let us turn to the future.

Id: [0x000A6573]
There are those among your kind who seek to craft a future from the wreckage of my people. To steal our forms. To use our devices for their own bidding. We must not allow that.

Id: [0x000A6581]
You know who I hate? The Vicar!

Id: [0x000A6583]
Oh, pipe down, do.

Id: [0x000A6585]
I'm telling you, he's always going on about "the Volunteer Army" and how he "took the pledge."

Id: [0x000A6587]
He ain't wrong.

Id: [0x000A6589]
He's a noodle! If wine's good enough for our lord and savior, beer's good enough for me.

Id: [0x000A658B]
See what I mean...? Ah, bloody hell!

Id: [0x000A658D]
Ha! Divine retribution!

Id: [0x000A658F]
Idiots.

Id: [0x000A6591]
Hmmm. See you at mass, then?

Id: [0x000A6597]
That feckless son of mine's asking for money again.

Id: [0x000A6599]
How much've you given him so far?

Id: [0x000A659B]
Two pound? Three? Can't keep him afloat forever, can I?

Id: [0x000A659D]
Too right, you can't.

Id: [0x000A659F]
I mean, you do your best to raise 'em right, but they just end up bleeding you dry.

Id: [0x000A65A1]
Never have kids, lads... oh, balls!

Id: [0x000A65A3]
Not your night, mate.

Id: [0x000A65A5]
[irritated sigh]

Id: [0x000A65A7]
Sorry, mate.

Id: [0x000A65A8]
Let's go.

Id: [0x000A65AE]
Let them know what you can do!

Id: [0x000A65B1]
Relive the events as if you were there! That's right! Our writers spare no details! Ladies and gentlemen, the gazette is not for the faint of heart! That's right!

Id: [0x000A65B3]
It's all in the Gazette! Only a penny! I said only a penny! Read the Gazette! Get it here! Get your copies! Learn the truth!

Id: [0x000A65BD]
Another round for my friends!

Id: [0x000A65BF]
With what money?

Id: [0x000A65C1]
With the coin, sir, of comradely good fellowship!

Id: [0x000A65C3]
So, pretend money then.

Id: [0x000A65C5]
Pretend? Is fraternity "pretend"? Is brotherhood? Espirit de corps?

Id: [0x000A65C7]
Pretend. Bah. I... bloody hell!

Id: [0x000A65C9]
Anybody going to tell him those are all the same thing?

Id: [0x000A65CB]
[annoyed sigh]

You need one of them new thesauruses, mate.

Id: [0x000A65D0]
Life don't get much better than this, do it?

Id: [0x000A65D2]
Uh-oh, he's gassed again.

Id: [0x000A65D4]
No no no, I'm being serious. You lads are the best mates a lad could have.

Id: [0x000A65D6]
Oh, ta!

Id: [0x000A65D8]
I mean, who's been with me through thick and thin, all these years? You lot.

Id: [0x000A65DA]
And I just want to tell you... oh, hell, I've gone sloppy!

Id: [0x000A65F6]
You there! Stay informed! Buy the gazette!

Id: [0x000A6632]
Hello. In the past, you hunt for one of my artifacts. But I come to you today to speak of the future. Follow Lydia Frye. She will lead you to me.

Id: [0x000A6634]
I don't know what happened.

Id: [0x000A6635]
I thought I'd lost you.

Id: [0x000A663B]
Over here! I'd like half-a-dozen sausages. Yes, the pork ones please.

Id: [0x000A663D]
Certainly madam.

Id: [0x000A663F]
What?

Id: [0x000A6641]
Will you poison this good woman's family too?

Id: [0x000A6643]
I assure you sir, all my meat is perfectly safe.

Id: [0x000A6645]
Perhaps I'll shop elsewhere.

Id: [0x000A6647]
Go on, look. Does that look spoiled to you?

Id: [0x000A6649]
No... no I suppose not.

Id: [0x000A665D]
It's fine, really.

Id: [0x000A665F]
You're doing me up!

Id: [0x000A6661]
Now, sir, it's a fair price, and the gentleman doesn't object. Do you?

Id: [0x000A6663]
Well, now that you mention it...

Id: [0x000A6665]
Course he don't. Now, take this ham, only sixpence a half-pound...

Id: [0x000A6667]
Sixpence? You're whipping the cat! That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard! Why, I'd think it was the height of the bloody French Revolution at those prices!

Id: [0x000A6669]
May I please just buy some meat?

Id: [0x000A666B]
Give it a rest, do!

Id: [0x000A666D]
Enough, sir!

Id: [0x000A666F]
I'm only trying to help you!

Id: [0x000A6671]
And I'm only trying to buy a sausage!

Id: [0x000A6673]
Fine! Let him rob you, then!

Id: [0x000A6675]
Clear off, will you, chum?

Sorry about that...

A famous professor dies twice!

That's once more than usual! Twice as many sales! My name will soon be known across the nation!

Id: [0x000A6698]
INT. Byng HOME

Id: [0x000A669C]
It's so very awful! The Professor died of a heart attack just days ago. Then tonight I hear poundin' at the door! I open it to find him bleedin' and in pain! He tried to say somethin' then collapsed dead. Again!

Id: [0x000A669F]
He got that a few days ago. Inside was a statue. I thought it was a marvel, but he told me it was quite common. I dunno who sent it.

Id: [0x000A66A2]
He kept repeating, "bah kesso, bah kesso." Over and over. What does it mean?

Id: [0x000A66A5]
Spider? Best get that out of here. Emmett is deathly afraid of spiders.

Id: [0x000A66A8]
I worked for the professor for eighteen years. He was a good man. I never had any cause to take his mortal life.

Id: [0x000A66A9]
INT. Byng HOME

Id: [0x000A66AD]
It’s unthinkable. Such a great man. We were still in mourning from the burial! He was buried yesterday in the family plot.

Id: [0x000A66BA]
My father was an eminent anthropologist and something of an explorer. He made his name by investigating the practices of a small village in the Congo. His colleagues at the university often send him trinkets from abroad.

Id: [0x000A66BB]
This is no time to talk about the will! It is true that my father and my fiancée didn’t get on, but I’m confident that once he got to know her as a daughter-in-law, they would have become friends.

Id: [0x000A66BC]
How dare you! He was my father! And why in heaven’s name would I have attacked him in such a manner?

Id: [0x000A66BD]
EXT. CEMETERY

Id: [0x000A66C1]
Body snatching? That is an insult. I’d be in the slammer quick as that if I got caught.

Id: [0x000A66CA]
Me? I plants ‘em or I sells ‘em. I don’t do ‘em in!

Id: [0x000A66CB]
He showed up again? First time that’s happened in thirty-five years of gravediggin'!

Id: [0x000A66CC]
I saw the son lock the tomb meself.

Id: [0x000A66CD]
It’s plain that seven guineas is a lot for a bloke like me. I’m careful with me pennies and save for a rainy day.

Id: [0x000A66D2]
So I sell a body or two on the side—a man’s gotta eat, ain’t he? I broke the lock and left him on a barrow just behind his tomb. Was dark, couldn't really see, but some fella come by and carted the ol’ professor off. It’s muddy back there, you can likely still see the tracks.

The anthropological sciences have lost a great mind. He revolutionalized the field. It is my fond hope that I may inherit his mantle.

Id: [0x000A66DA]
Which one is that? Sorry, difficult to read. I’ve lost my spectacles somewhere.

Id: [0x000A66DD]
I recently traveled to Africa in order to continue studies on the indigenous tribe Professor Byng discovered some time ago.

Id: [0x000A66E6]
I required his knowledge in order to become the greatest anthropologist in the British Empire! And his beloved tribe of savages provided the method.

An eminent colleague. He wrote prolifically – probably no one will ever amass the amount of knowledge he acquired.

Id: [0x000A66EE]
I’m most vexed about that! A rare specimen of the sort I’ve been studying for years. It escaped a few days ago, no doubt due to that scatter-brained assistant, Virginia.

Id: [0x000A66F1]
My thesis subject. My South American colleagues tell me that this particular arachnid is only found in the Bolivian Andes. Fascinating subject.

I just lost my most esteemed colleague, I had nothing to gain from his death.

Id: [0x000A66FF]
A lovely man. And quite wealthy! I only wish he had lived to bless my alliance with his son.

Id: [0x000A6702]
I'm sorry to hear about that. Do you know whether that change was actually made?

Id: [0x000A6705]
Yes, that’s mine. I misplaced a similar one, possibly at the funeral. I was so upset.

Id: [0x000A6708]
He was a stubborn old coot, but I wouldn't murder anyone!

Id: [0x000A670A]
I hoped you wouldn't find that. I'm afraid several of the faculty purchase cadavers for research purposes. It's a fact of university life.

I can't believe I agreed to this nonsense.

Give us a hand with this.

I need a proper workshop!

What d'you think?

Not sure. Come and have a look at this.

I know it's bent, can we fix it?

Oh, certainly.

Thanks awfully.

Id: [0x000A67FD]
Not at all, don't mention it.

Id: [0x000A6801]
So what's the plan then?

Id: [0x000A6803]
Right. Couldn't be easier. The bank guards change shift every day at six, ya follow?

Id: [0x000A6805]
There's four entrances, here, here, here, and here.

Id: [0x000A6807]
Now, the vault's trickier, but that's where you come in.

Id: [0x000A6809]
I'm with you. Won't be a problem. Never met a safe I can't blow.

Id: [0x000A680B]
Just get me in there and keep the guards off me. I'll have that door open on the tick.

Id: [0x000A680D]
Yes you will. Shouldn't be a problem.

Id: [0x000A680F]

Just you worry about your end and let me worry about mine. We do this right and we'll end up rich as Cresus. Savvy?

Id: [0x000A6813]
Savvy. Here's to riches.

Id: [0x000A6815]
Well, best be off, then.

Id: [0x000A6817]
Give it a bit. I think someone's watching us.

Id: [0x000A681E]
Oi, chum! Over here!

Id: [0x000A681F]
Yeah, I won't be a moment!

Id: [0x000A6822]
Oi! What about us?

Id: [0x000A6826]
Right you are, sir!

Id: [0x000A6839]
I was standing there, having a think, when a fella come at me and give me a thumpin'. Dooley tries to stop 'im, and he thrashes Dooley! I run out to find help.

Id: [0x000A683C]
When I come back, the man's lyin' dead and there's Dooley holding a knife! Please don't arrest him!

I was too scared to do anything!

INT. WAREHOUSE

Id: [0x000A6844]
He's me brother. He don't like to work hard, so one of the workers give him a thrashin'. I tried to stop it, and he stops hitting Buck and starts hittin' me!

Id: [0x000A6847]
He knocks me to the ground and give me a kick. I find my work-knife under me and grab it. I lift me hands to protect meself, and he knocks me out with a punch! Later on, I wakes up, and the man's lying there, dead!

Id: [0x000A684A]
Me!? No!

Id: [0x000A684C]
Piss off, you! Go buy yer trinkets somewhere else!

Here you are, sir.

INT. WAREHOUSE

Id: [0x000A685B]
I arrived to find the foreman dead, and the lad, Dooley, with bloody hands. No one's been able to find the murder weapon and arrest the murderer. Could you sort it out quickly? It's holding up the work.

Id: [0x000A6862]
They're a rough bunch, but someone has to keep the kids in line. I just wish the grown-ups would quit fighting each other!

Id: [0x000A6863]
Why would I kill a perfectly productive worker?

Id: [0x000A6864]

Id: [0x000A6866]
You may want to ask Dooley about that.

Id: [0x000A6868]
I believe you have a new location to investigate.

Id: [0x000A686A]
Perhaps you should go back and ask people about this new information.

Id: [0x000A686C]
It might be productive to question some suspects again.

Id: [0x000A686E]
Look for more clues.

Id: [0x000A6870]
Try to establish a motive.

Id: [0x000A6872]
Which suspects had the opportunity to kill him?

Id: [0x000A6874]
How would the murderer have done it?

Id: [0x000A6876]
Re-examine some of the clues more closely.

Pull yourself together, man!

I beg your pardon, ladies and gentlemen.

Id: [0x000A68AD]
Look, do you have what I require or not?

Id: [0x000A68AF]
If you can't help me, I shall take my custom elsewhere!

Please sir, I beg of you! Just a moment while I help these people and then I'll be with you directly!

Id: [0x000A68B3]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000A68C5]
Take your time, sir. I ain't going nowhere, and neither is they.

Have you got something that would go a bit further?

Id: [0x000A68C9]
Got this lovely haddock, sir.

Hmm, yes, that might do.

I was having a chat with one of the others when I heard a commotion and ran in there to find Wilkins dead. Poor bloke, killed by that filthy, little bastard that we feed and pay!

Id: [0x000A68F7]
I should be foreman here! Wilkins coddled the boys like a mother hen. He come along and stops me givin' the boy a beatin'.

Id: [0x000A68F9]
Care for some fish, sir?

Id: [0x000A68FB]
I would, as it happens, yes. Tell me, what's your freshest catch.

Id: [0x000A68FD]
Perhaps you'd care to try a lovely Dover sole? So fresh it'd swim if you put it in water.

Id: [0x000A68FF]
Hmm...

Id: [0x000A6901]
Not to your liking, sir?

Id: [0x000A6903]
Not entirely. What about plaice? Or mackerel?

Id: [0x000A6905]
Got those right here, kept fresh as fresh, sir.

Id: [0x000A6907]
Yes, lovely--no, dash it all, it upsets my brother-in-law's digestion.

Id: [0x000A6909]
That's a right shame, sir.

Id: [0x000A690B]
Yes, hardly do to poison the chap. I'll keep looking.

Id: [0x000A690D]
Take as much time as you need.

Id: [0x000A690F]
What about a cod? Have you any cod?

Id: [0x000A6911]
Plenty, sir.

That might be just the thing, then.

Well, I was inside the brewery all day. I wear me bandana in there. A man has to, what with all the smells and fumes.

I was inside, you arse. I wasn't even there!

Id: [0x000A691C]
EXT. COURTYARD

Id: [0x000A6920]
Me and Wilkins was working out here. We heard screamin'. Wilkins went to see what it was about and never come back. I went to see for meself and there he was, dead! I didn't stick around, somebody might think I done it!

Id: [0x000A6923]
He was me mate. I wouldn't kill him!

Id: [0x000A692C]
I screamed because a guard started to hit me, not the other way 'round!

Id: [0x000A692F]
Buck got hit real good and then started screamin'.

Id: [0x000A6932]
The fumes can be a bit much in the brewery. When the men work in there, they wear bandanas.

Id: [0x000A6935]
Wilkins wasn't the type to beat the children. On the contrary, he was forever getting in fights trying to stop that sort of thing.

Id: [0x000A6938]
Things'll change for Morris. Wilkins always seemed to assign him the most difficult jobs!

All done. But still not a customer in sight!

Id: [0x000A6988]
Oh, my God, Prudence?! How horrible! I was about to propose!... But I don't understand. She and I didn't have a meeting arranged today. It is true that we sometimes meet in the park. But there was no arrangement for this morning.

Id: [0x000A698B]
That's very odd, indeed. Prudence was a patient here but wasn't given this prescription. There's no reason that she should be carrying such a packet.

Id: [0x000A698E]
You appreciate, I'm sure, that I cannot discuss the condition of any of my patients.

Id: [0x000A6991]
An unfortunate incident. One of my patients became... over-excited.

Id: [0x000A6994]
Oh, God, it's true. I couldn't help myself, the powder unleashed a creature within me. He seduced the innocent Prudence and then killed her to prevent us from marrying! It's too, too horrible!

I don't know any of Dr. Alton's other patients.

Id: [0x000A69A5]
I'm quite angry, actually. I was having such terrific results; I felt like a new man! Much more vigorous and out-going. But the doctor has ended the prescription altogether for no reason!

Id: [0x000A69AB]
I may have some problems, but brutally murdering people isn't one of them.

Id: [0x000A69AC]
INT. Doctor's LABORATORY

Id: [0x000A69B0]
I'm sorry to hear about her murder. She was a patient here, but increasingly began to stop by, socially.

Id: [0x000A69B3]
Mr. Baxter apparently attacked the doctor yesterday. It was after hours, but the doctor did have a cut on his cheek. Poor man.

Id: [0x000A69B6]
I think that Prudence was a schemer and I believe that I would make a better match for the doctor, but murder someone? I'm a nurse!

Id: [0x000A69BD]
You ready? He's right there. Won't get a better opportunity.

Id: [0x000A69BF]
Easy, easy. No need to rush it. Wait till he's alone.

Id: [0x000A69C1]
And when he is, we'll make the bastard pay!

Id: [0x000A69C4]
So she was meeting Doctor Alton in the park, was she? My understanding was that she was engaged to someone. In any case, the good doctor could do better, in my opinion. Perhaps now he will!

Id: [0x000A69C7]
That medicine was developed by Dr. Alton, specifically for one of our patients, Mr. Shelby, but he's been using it for another patient as well.

Id: [0x000A69CA]
Dr. Alton makes house calls to see him. Baxter doesn't come into the office. I make up the prescriptions and he picks them up at noon when I'm away at lunch.

Id: [0x000A69CB]
Hmm... maybe, no... hmm.

Id: [0x000A69CD]
Good show, Rog. Not the strongest play, but it seems to have agitated old Stan. [pause] I suppose it falls to me to finish the set and claim the hand. Well, if I must I must.

Prudence and I are engaged to be married. I'm desperate to see her. She should be by any moment, she had something important to tell me. I'm worried she's going to break off the engagement.

Id: [0x000A69FE]
Prudence has been so distant lately. I believe she has a misplaced affection for her doctor, the cad! I would make a much more appropriate husband, and the wedding is planned!

Id: [0x000A69FF]
I've never heard of such a man.

Id: [0x000A6A05]
I saw her kissing my man in the park, didn't I? I followed her to this street yesterday, but lost her. I'll come every day, if need be, until I catch her again. That trollop better promise to let him alone, or I'll give her what for!

Id: [0x000A6A0B]
He's all mine, I tell you! All the girls want a bit of Baxter, but they can’t have him! You ask him yourself—he lives just that way.

A very unpleasant fellow! ... But what was that business about a knighthood ceremony? In any case, Mr. Raymond will have his story for Purlock Publishing.

EXT. STREET

Id: [0x000A7BC8]
Very good sleuthing on you part. It's a miracle anyone survived what with all those bullets whizzing about!

Id: [0x000A7BCB]
I believe something larger is afoot. A lot of murderous anger concerning industrialists. Might be something to look into.

Id: [0x000A7BCC]
INT. TRAIN - DINING CAR

Id: [0x000A7BCD]
It's very close in here. We need to open some of these windows.

Id: [0x000A7BCF]
Open these here.

Id: [0x000A7BD1]
And these. The breeze will help clear out the miasma.

Id: [0x000A7BD3]
Not these, though. Keep those ones closed.

Id: [0x000A7BD5]
Of course, miss.

Id: [0x000A7BD7]
Good.

Id: [0x000A7BDB]
I think I could pass as one of them long enough to sneak you inside. Except - the guards out here already know my face. You'd need to deal with them first.

Id: [0x000A7BDC]
EXT. FACTORY

Id: [0x000A7BE0]
The young lads across the street were fooling with a pistol they'd found. A bullet must have gone astray through the wooden fence. Hit Mr. Prescott smack in the chest. Bloody unlucky for all concerned.

Id: [0x000A7BEC]
What are you talking about, I'm a bloody policeman! Think again! Whoever did this had a very strong motive.

Id: [0x000A7BED]
EXT. FACTORY

Id: [0x000A7BF1]
I was on my way here. Heard two shots, I did. Right at the stroke of noon.

Id: [0x000A7BF7]
What!? I was here all along, the gun went off over there somewheres. We're not in Africa anymore, the war's over for us. I don’t shoot my officers!

Id: [0x000A7BFA]
He was a good man. Very honorable. I’m proud to have served under Colonel Prescott in the 11th Foot, Gold Coast, Africa.

Id: [0x000A7C00]
What!? Dammit, another one! Someone puts one of these up every few weeks! Disrespectful is what it is! … Oh, it’s an African symbol. I don’t want to talk about it.

Id: [0x000A7C03]
Prescott put that up in memory of the time he lead a sortie across the Pra River to outflank Ashanti warriors. Things turned out badly that day. Horrific. We lost several of our comrades. Prescott wanted us to remember them.

Id: [0x000A7C09]
Bullet hole in the clock? That’s a new one. It could have already been there when I arrived at noon. Or maybe it was the second shot I heard.

Id: [0x000A7C0B]

Brother George. It is as I feared. London has fallen.

EXT. LONDON

Id: [0x000A7C12]
Thrice I have written to you, begging your aid. Thrice you've responded – with silence. And yet I write again, so desperate my need, so few my options. I need you. London needs you.

Id: [0x000A7C13]
CUT TO:

Id: [0x000A7C15]
You would say it is too great of a task. Or that it is not yet time to strike. Patience, you would counsel.

INT. STARRICK’S OFFICE

Id: [0x000A7C18]
But whilst you wait, the Templars consolidate their power. They have chosen a Grand Master so ruthless, so thorough, one might think Reginald Birch, himself, had returned.

Id: [0x000A7C1A]
His name is Crawford Starrick. And he intends to rule the world.

Id: [0x000A7C1C]
There is no aspect of society he does not control. No industry that escapes his grim touch.

Id: [0x000A7C1E]
By day it is corrupt merchants and venal politicians who hold court.

Id: [0x000A7C20]
Come night, a vicious street gang known as the Blighters strikes terror in the hearts of all.

Id: [0x000A7C22]
There is no business untainted by his poison. No person unexploited – be it by duplicity or force.

Id: [0x000A7C24]
Our enemy has designs on the highest office of them all.

Id: [0x000A7C26]
And so as you look inward– and dare I say it - afraid – Crawford Starrick's ambition is fixed on the beyond: To kingdoms and continents as yet unconquered. Though not for long.

Id: [0x000A7C28]
For he knows – as I have warned you – time and time again - whosoever controls London, controls the world.

EXT. CROYDON

EXT. FACTORY

Id: [0x000A7C44]
We stood right there on a mark and shot the target. I went to shoot but there was a loud bang! I was surprised and missed the target completely. It wasn't me who killed the man, I’m no murderer!

Id: [0x000A7C47]
We found a revolver underneath the lumberyard window. Don't know where it come from.

Id: [0x000A7C59]
I didn’t do it! The gun went off and then I saw the truck and there was beer everywhere! I didn’t do no harm, honest!

Id: [0x000A7C74]
The fellow in bed seven isn't doing well. I doubt he'll last the night.

Id: [0x000A7C76]
Poor man. I'll fetch the vicar.

Id: [0x000A7C78]
Good, but be discreet.

Id: [0x000A7C7A]
Of course.

Id: [0x000A7C7C]
No point distressing the other patients.

Id: [0x000A7C7E]
No, absolutely not.

Id: [0x000A7C82]
A gentleman will be coming by with a cart tonight. Leave the door unlocked.

Id: [0x000A7C84]
A cart, miss?

Id: [0x000A7C86]
For the bodies.

Id: [0x000A7C88]
Bodies?!

Id: [0x000A7C8A]
To take to the medical school.

Id: [0x000A7C8C]
[gasp]

Id: [0x000A7C8E]
I know it seems unchristian, but it keeps us in operational funds.

Id: [0x000A7C99]
Him and me liked to insult each other. I was a lieutenant under his command in Africa. I loved the army, no one questions you when you wear a uniform! Anyways, every morning when he arrived, we’d call out and joke with each other.

Id: [0x000A7C9C]
Ah, yeh. Well. Prescott led a flanking sortie that went wrong, lots of casualties. Some men called the Colonel a coward, but it were really just bad luck. Anyway, he resigned. To make amends, he offered work at his factory whenever one of us left the army.

Id: [0x000A7C9F]
I admit it. I sell stolen rifles and pistols. All very hush-hush. Black market.

Id: [0x000A7CA2]
I made that shot. Early this morning, Prescott challenged me to plug the 12 from my shop. I missed just low. No one witnessed it, it was too early in the morning.

Id: [0x000A7CA5]
Six-sided bullet? Whitworth rifle uses those. That’s what I shoot with myself. Beautiful weapon. Very accurate. It's only used by the army.

Id: [0x000A7CAD]
A white feather? That's an Ashanti symbol. Sign of cowardice. Why? You seen one somewhere?

Id: [0x000A7CAF]
I brought that gun back from Africa. I was a sniper fighting the Ashanti. I used that gun this morning for Prescott’s challenge. It’s the only Whitworth we have, I’d never sell it.

Id: [0x000A7CB0]
Me? I couldn’t have shot him from the attic at that angle. I only shot a clock!

Id: [0x000A7CB2]
[vomiting sounds]

Id: [0x000A7CB4]
Easy on... easy there.

Id: [0x000A7CB6]

Shh, it's all right.

Id: [0x000A7CBA]

Doctor! Doctor!

Id: [0x000A7CBE]
[coughing]

Id: [0x000A7CC0]
There we are... rest easy.

Id: [0x000A7CC1]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000A7CC4]
Won't be but a moment, gents.

Id: [0x000A7CC5]
[inhales deeply]

EXT. BARREL DEPOT

Id: [0x000A7CD4]
Saw him each morning as I drove by. Seemed like a good sort.

Id: [0x000A7CDA]
The poor lad. Fell on my doorstep a few years ago. He's in a bad way, has some sort of malady. Rides in the back while I make deliveries. Hard worker – very determined.

Id: [0x000A7CE9]
I was just driving a cart! I’m not the killer and the killer wasn’t in the street I can assure you of that, or I would have seen what he done!

Id: [0x000A7CEF]
We lost an entire barrel of beer, damn it! I heard two loud bangs, but thought nothing of it. Later, I find a bullet hole in a barrel! Imagine that, a bullet hole! My lad, Samuel, might know more. He’s around back, tossing trash in the river.

Id: [0x000A7CF0]
EXT. BARREL DEPOT

Id: [0x000A7CF4]
His goddamn cowardice in Africa got me best friends killed. He shoulda faced a firing squad.

Id: [0x000A7D04]
I just drop off beer. Don’t pay much attention to people along the way.

Id: [0x000A7D05]
There was a hole in a barrel. I've got no explanation for that.

Id: [0x000A7D06]
That’s for some sickness I picked up a while ago. Can’t remember the name of it.

Id: [0x000A7D09]
Caught it in the river. Wrung its neck. Going to make me a pillow.

Id: [0x000A7D0C]
Never heard of such a thing. Does it float?

Id: [0x000A7D15]
No, no, move it over there!

Id: [0x000A7D17]
Sharpish!

Id: [0x000A7D18]
Well, I--

Id: [0x000A7D21]
Steady... steady...

Id: [0x000A7D23]
Drop it! Yes, there!

Id: [0x000A7D25]
Hmmm... yes... good, good.

Id: [0x000A7D26]
GAMEPLAY – EXT. TOWER OF LONDON COURTYARD

Id: [0x000A7D28]
All right. I'm happy to help with a direct approach.

Id: [0x000A7D2A]
INT. PSYCHIC SEANCE ROOM

Id: [0x000A7D2E]
I don't understand what happened! He foretold his own death, but I didn't expect it to happen like this!

Id: [0x000A7D31]
He was an incredible psychic. I came to clarify some, ahem, personal financial matters.

Id: [0x000A7D34]
Why would I kill him? He and I had a good plot going! We fooled people, but the people who paid most dearly were the thieves

Id: [0x000A7D3B]
INT. PSYCHIC SEANCE ROOM

Id: [0x000A7D3F]
I was so hoping to hear from my loved one. I'm convinced Thaddeus could have communicated Mittens wishes to me. I must know to whom Mittens wishes that I should leave my fortune. And now Thaddeus is lost to us... I shall never know!

Id: [0x000A7D46]
I sought him out after the death of Mittens.

Id: [0x000A7D48]
Mittens is my beloved kitty-cat! She was run over by a milk wagon several weeks ago. I've been trying desperately to contact my sweet thing ever since. I'm not well, though, and likely haven't long to live myself.

Id: [0x000A7D4A]
I am speechless. Thaddeus was a great man and I mourn his loss. I can only hope he is with my fluffy Mittens now.

Id: [0x000A7D4B]
INT. PSYCHIC SEANCE ROOM

Id: [0x000A7D4F]
I'm so sorry to lose Thaddeus. The oddest part is that he claimed all would be revealed to each of us before his death.

Id: [0x000A7D55]
I've been coming here to decide whether I should accept a marriage proposal. Thaddeus had been attempting to contact my departed sister so that she could give me advice. Thaddeus was a kind man who sincerely wanted me to make the best choice. Now what am I to do?

Id: [0x000A7D5B]
I have no doubt that his powers were genuine. He was able to tell me of my daily comings and goings and all manner of details that he couldn't possibly have known. He certainly was going to be able to put me in contact with my sister.

Id: [0x000A7D5C]
Why on earth would I kill the only person who could contact my beloved sister?

Id: [0x000A7D5D]
INT. PSYCHIC SEANCE ROOM

Id: [0x000A7D65]
This is so frustrating! I had a simple question, but have had to come back for séance after séance! Week after week! Each time, Thaddeus divined a partial number from The Other Side, but never the entire correct number! Today he promised that I would get everything!

Id: [0x000A7D68]
Thaddeus felt that if I signed some papers it would demonstrate to my dead father that I had absolute trust in Thaddeus.

Id: [0x000A7D6B]
I honestly had no idea that Thaddeus was cheating me. He must have been a very shrewd character to fool a sharp fellow like me.

Id: [0x000A7D6D]
Thaddeus the Amazing really was amazing. He predicted his own death - and it happened! I knew the man wasn't a fake. If only he'd told me the number before he died!

Id: [0x000A7D85]
Darling, darling, look!

Id: [0x000A7D87]
Well that is surely the most peculiar thing I've ever seen!

Id: [0x000A7D89]
Some sort of political protest, I imagine.

Id: [0x000A7D8B]
What? That's absurd, what could they be protesting?

Id: [0x000A7D8D]
Irish home rule?

Id: [0x000A7D8F]
Don't be so absurd!

Id: [0x000A7D90]
INT. PSYCHIC SEANCE ROOM

Id: [0x000A7D95]
He was going to reveal my plot! He paid the price for betraying a fellow crook.

Id: [0x000A7D9F]
I attend Lady Ursula at these sessions. She's ailing and needs someone to help her along. I have no particular belief in an after world, but if it comforts m'lady, I see no harm.

Id: [0x000A7DA0]
Nothing but a showman, really. Each week he gave a séance with all his clients present together. So many people makes everything much more dramatic.

Id: [0x000A7DA1]
INT. ROBERTS' HOUSE

Id: [0x000A7DA6]
I went along to the séances a couple of times. I thought it was a waste of my brother's time.

Id: [0x000A7DAC]
My father left everything to Howard! Well, I had other ideas. But they had nothing to do with murder! I wasn't even there!

Id: [0x000A7DAF]
My brother has become obsessed with some secret bank account. He inherited almost all of my father's fortune - as well he should as the male heir - but some was locked in a secret account. I think it unlikely that it should be a significant amount.

Id: [0x000A7DB1]
Power of attorney to a psychic? That sounds very unusual, indeed.

Id: [0x000A7DB4]
So tell me about these "Blighters".

Id: [0x000A7DB5]
In search of an army, Starrick gathered up the nastiest of the Underworld. Some of the city’s gangs tried to prevent it - and were slaughtered for their efforts. Now, only Whitechapel's Clinkers remain opposed. But they're no match for the Blighters.

Id: [0x000A7DB6]
Well let’s shine these Clinkers up then, shall we? They're just the sort we're looking for!

Id: [0x000A7DB9]
You can't be serious.

Id: [0x000A7DBA]
Evie, they're ready to fight and oppose the Blighters. This is my chance to step in! [a beat]Look out London, here come the Rooks!

Id: [0x000A7DBD]
INT. Asquith house

Id: [0x000A7DC1]
The man was a fraud and I'm glad he's dead but someone in my position doesn’t commit murder!

Id: [0x000A7DCF]
Never trust a man who tells you what you want to hear. He's after something! Taking advantage of my daughter's love for her departed sister. With that charlatan gone, things can get back to normal. My daughter's engagement to Everett Boyd can be announced at last.

Id: [0x000A7DD0]
A girl Janice’s age should be married. Everett is a very sensible young man from a good family. He'll be very successful, I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x000A7DD1]
Janice's elder sister was strong-willed. Janice always followed her lead. That's why it's so sad that she asks her advice even in death. Time for Janice to think for herself! I know what's best for her.

Id: [0x000A7DD2]
INT. Asquith house

Id: [0x000A7DD7]
Her father mentioned this swindler to me. I understand it's because of him that my engagement has been delayed.

Id: [0x000A7DDA]
Janice is a lovely creature. I would be honored were she to accept my proposal. I do adore her.

Id: [0x000A7DDD]
I know the owner of a local brewery and I am convinced his business will flourish. He just needs some financial backing. Now Janice is free to be married at last, I’ll invest my dowry in the brewery and make a fortune!

Id: [0x000A7DE0]
The psychic was going to expose me. But I was nowhere near the crime scene.

Id: [0x000A7DE1]
EXT. OUTSIDE Asquith house

Id: [0x000A7DE6]
That's me! Yeah, some fella come by here every so often. Gives me a silver sixpence if I tell him everything about the folks in that house.

Id: [0x000A7DE9]
Nothin' unusual about him. Just a regular fella. I seen him go into that building over there.

Id: [0x000A7DF4]
INT. LADY URSULA'S HOUSE

Id: [0x000A7DF8]
Lady Ursula's health is not good at all. And now she's lost her cat, it's almost like she has nothing left to live for.

Id: [0x000A7DFD]
He's been Lady Ursula's butler for years. We have plans to marry. But first, Douglas needs to put together a little nest egg. He says he'll have some money soon.

Id: [0x000A7DFF]
Lady Ursula was planning to leave her fortune to her cat, Mittens. Since the cat passed on, she's been going to that spiritualist in hopes that Mittens will tell her what to do with the money.

Id: [0x000A7E00]
My fond hope is to marry Douglas. I think him a good man. Why would I interfere with a psychic?

Id: [0x000A7E03]
Can you bloody believe that?

Id: [0x000A7E05]
Not half!

Id: [0x000A7E07]
Darling, darling, look!

Id: [0x000A7E09]
[gasp] Bloody hell! Did you see that?

Id: [0x000A7E14]
What in the...?

Id: [0x000A7E16]
Look! Look!

Id: [0x000A7E18]
Darling, stay back.

Id: [0x000A7E1A]
The hell I will, get away!

Id: [0x000A7E1C]
But it's dangerous!

Id: [0x000A7E1E]
Watch it, mate! Hands off!

Id: [0x000A7E20]
Sorry, sorry. But you saw it, didn't you?

Id: [0x000A7E25]
Hm, I'll certainly think about it.

Id: [0x000A7E26]
Perhaps I should ask Jacob what he thinks.

Id: [0x000A7E28]
I shall have to speak with Miss Eccleston again.

Id: [0x000A7E29]
Sorry, Evie, I really can't speak now.

Id: [0x000A7E2A]
I would rather curtail our conversation, if you don't mind.

Id: [0x000A7E2E]
We were short staffed again.

Id: [0x000A7E31]
Yours are the only patients with complaints. Do you know why? Because the older nurses know their place and don't complicate caring for their patients with needless questions.

Id: [0x000A7E32]
Yes, doctor.

Id: [0x000A7E33]
Good. Now... what else've we got?

Id: [0x000A7E34]
EXT. STREET - CITY OF LONDON

Id: [0x000A7E36]
Think of that, crushed by a crate! The most hated man in London!

Id: [0x000A7E37]
Can you imagine achieving such a title? One day my brilliance will bring me similar recognition!

Id: [0x000A7E38]
Mr. Raymond? What are you talking about?

Id: [0x000A7E39]
It's of no consequence. What's important is that this man was hated by many, but who delivered the fatal blow?

Id: [0x000A7E3B]
I suppose I shall just have to live with it.

Id: [0x000A7E3C]
Thank you again for your forthrightness, Jacob.

Id: [0x000A7E3D]
I am finding out that emotions can be cruel.

Id: [0x000A7E3E]
That's enough emotion for one day.

Id: [0x000A7E40]
Sorry, Jacob. but I really want to be alone.

Id: [0x000A7E41]
I'd rather stick with my invention, I think.

Id: [0x000A7E42]
EXT. STREET - CITY OF LONDON

Id: [0x000A7E44]
What on earth! I can assure you I have taken the Hippocratic Oath and have never broken it!

Id: [0x000A7E54]
Sorry, Evie, but my lesson won't write itself.

Id: [0x000A7E55]
I shall be needing time to myself now, Evie, if you don't mind.

Id: [0x000A7E5C]
Sorry, I don't know where Henry is.

Id: [0x000A7E5D]
I really must get on.

Id: [0x000A7E5E]
You've certainly given me food for thought.

Id: [0x000A7E5F]
I really would like to sit for a while and think about everything.

Id: [0x000A7E61]
Come back later.

Id: [0x000A7E62]
Sorry, Evie, I really can't speak now.

Id: [0x000A7E63]
I would rather curtail our conversation, if you don't mind.

Id: [0x000A7E65]
I'll never get used to that word.

Id: [0x000A7E66]
The worst thing is you know you will die, but you don't know when.

Id: [0x000A7E67]
I hope I have a long life. There is so much to do.

Id: [0x000A7E68]
Since my brother Ed left us, I sometimes feel everything is so futile.

Id: [0x000A7E69]
I must get to grips with myself, I know.

Id: [0x000A7E6A]
Thank you for your words of wisdom, Evie.

Id: [0x000A7E6C]
Now I really must get on.

Id: [0x000A7E6E]
[sigh]Come back, later.

Id: [0x000A7E70]
I want to make a difference to people.

Id: [0x000A7E71]
I must work till I succeed.

Id: [0x000A7E72]
Thank you for your visit, Jacob, I will catch up with you another time.

Id: [0x000A7E73]
Now I really must get on.

Id: [0x000A7E75]
Come back, later.

Id: [0x000A7E77]
Hmm. I'll think about it.

Id: [0x000A7E78]
Now I really must get on.

Id: [0x000A7E79]
I would rather curtail our conversation, if you don't mind.

Id: [0x000A7E7A]
Come back, later.

Id: [0x000A7E7C]
You're right, I really ought to get cracking on my speaking telegraph.

Id: [0x000A7E7D]
Now I really must get on.

Id: [0x000A7E7E]
I would rather curtail our conversation, if you don't mind.

Id: [0x000A7E7F]
Come back, later.

I shall certainly look into what you say.

Id: [0x000A7E86]
You have given me much food for thought, thank you, Evie.

Id: [0x000A7E87]
I'm afraid I have to get on, see you later.

Id: [0x000A7E89]
Please, do come back, later.

Id: [0x000A7E8B]
Now, I suppose I'd better get back to work if I'm to be worthy of your confidence.

Id: [0x000A7E8C]
Thank you for your words of wisdom, Evie.

Id: [0x000A7E8D]
Bye, bye, dear Evie.

Now I really must get on.

These are my orders for the day, nurse, so please pay attention. Firstly, make sure this ward is thoroughly cleaned before you leave.

Id: [0x000A7FCE]
Now, the inebriate in bed nineteen should receive a tonic of auric chloride four times a day.

Id: [0x000A7FCF]
Mrs. Stubbs in bed six is a violent lunatic, so she may try to bite you when you give her her laudanum enema.

Id: [0x000A7FD0]
Yes, doctor.

Id: [0x000A7FD1]
Have I forgotten anyone? Hmm...

Id: [0x000A7FD2]
There's the patient in bed two...

Id: [0x000A7FD3]
Yes, what of him?

Id: [0x000A7FD4]
We've been unable to get him to take his lithium salts for two days.

Id: [0x000A7FD5]
Tie him down and force him. Get that ape of an orderly to help.

Id: [0x000A7FD6]
As you wish, doctor.

Id: [0x000A7FD7]
Yes, I think that is just about it.

Id: [0x000A7FF9]
I know the man. He’s hated by everyone! Surprisingly, it’s not clear what killed him. I find multiple wounds. No need to send many people to jail for killing such a terrible man. What say you only arrest the single person who actually caused his death.

Id: [0x000A7FFC]
Easily enough weight to kill a man instantly.

Id: [0x000A7FFF]
A bullet in that part of the torso would stagger a man for a moment and there would be a spurt of blood. He could continue to walk for up to four minutes before collapsing.

Id: [0x000A8002]
He appears to have been stabbed with a perforating weapon, perhaps a spike of some kind. There would be bleeding and it would affect motor control right away, but death wouldn’t come for another six minutes.

Id: [0x000A8005]
I suspect that there is at least one deadly toxin in his system.

Id: [0x000A8008]
Very regimented fellow, ran his day like clockwork.

Id: [0x000A800D]
INT. Pharmacy

Id: [0x000A8011]
He’s been coming to me for years. He arrives precisely at 1 o’clock and leaves 2 minutes later. He takes a bluish medication every day and prefers that I administer it.

Id: [0x000A8014]
Mary is a trusted assistant. As far as I know, she’s completely above board. Today, she swept the shop and prepared some medications. She also fetched herself an apple from the apple stand.

Id: [0x000A8017]
This really is none of your business. He came to me for his blue medication. I gave him blue medication!

Id: [0x000A8023]
I don't believe the timing of the poison indicates that I'm the one killed the man. More's the pity!

Id: [0x000A802E]
INT. Pharmacy

Id: [0x000A8031]
I see him here every day. He can be unpleasant, but I don’t really know him.

Id: [0x000A8034]
Quite right, I asked the apple seller to give him a special apple. Is that a crime? He was a horrid man, that's all I have to say.

Id: [0x000A803A]
I'm not that clever with poisons. It's likely something else did him in.

Id: [0x000A803C]
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

Id: [0x000A803F]
He owned this site and paid us. We all hated him because he looked for any excuse to cheat us out of our wages. I didn’t hate him any more or less than my mates.

Id: [0x000A8042]
That’s around the time I'm given a few minutes to eat something. About then I woulda been buying myself an apple at the stand down the street.

Id: [0x000A8045]
I was off eatin' an apple when it happened! Blimey!

Id: [0x000A8048]
It’s difficult to work properly. You’d have to know what you’re doing to drop it at just the right moment.

Id: [0x000A804B]
Eddie? Yeah, I taught him how to work the crane a few days ago.

Id: [0x000A804E]
We had a fella get his arm crushed about two weeks ago. He couldn't work anymore so Ashton sent him off. Don't know how he'll survive. He was Eddie's best mate.

Id: [0x000A8050]
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE

Id: [0x000A8053]
The man’s a right bastard. I hope he’s smoldering in hell.

Id: [0x000A8062]
I watched the crate fall onto him. Looked to me like he was dead before it hit him.

Id: [0x000A8065]
I’m not a crane operator. I wouldn’t know how to work that.

Id: [0x000A8066]
My best chum is maimed for life! And Ashton didn’t care a fig! He deserved what happened. Beyond that, I'm mum.

Id: [0x000A8067]
EXT. PUB

Id: [0x000A806A]
Ashton stops in front of this pub every afternoon to check on business rumors. Something of a bastard, Ashton. Told me he had a bit of jam on the side, if you know what I mean. Wife didn’t know about it. Well, the bit o’ jam wants out, but he won’t let her. That’s the sort of fellow we’re speaking of.

Id: [0x000A806D]
That was Ashton's doing! The man had it in for me. He paid workers to wreck my machines! Cost me a fortune. As long as he was around, I’d never prosper.

Id: [0x000A8070]
As a matter of fact, I do carry a revolver at all times. It can be a dangerous neighborhood for a wealthy fellow such as myself. This proves nothing.

Id: [0x000A8073]
I shot him, but didn't hit him where it counts. My bullet wasn't what killed the bastard.

Id: [0x000A8075]
EXT. APPLE STAND

Id: [0x000A8078]
He stopped by here every day at the exact same time. He’d buy an apple and try to cheat me out of tuppence, but then most folks do that.

Id: [0x000A807B]
Yeah, that sounds right. Came by for an apple. He was here when we heard the crate hit the ground.

Id: [0x000A807E]
Mr. Ashton did look strange, like. Eyes all yellowish. And then he turned pale after he bit into the apple. Almost green, really.

Id: [0x000A8081]
If I killed my customers, where would I be?

Id: [0x000A8083]
EXT. STREET

Id: [0x000A8086]
He’s my husband. Each day I bring him the household expenses just after he eats his apple. I also brought him his invitation to the knighthood ceremony. The one with the special scepter. Of course, he wasn’t going to take me along.

Id: [0x000A8089]
Very well! I found out about his dalliance with that girl from the pharmacy. It’s not the first! Divorce is all but impossible given his influence with the clergy!

Id: [0x000A808C]
I often tie up my hair around a knitting needle. What business is it of yours?

Id: [0x000A808F]
I'll be the toast of the town!

Id: [0x000A8092]
Girl who works at the pharmacy? Yeah, she slipped me an extra thruppence! She had a special apple, just for Mr. Ashton. I gave him that one when he come by.

Id: [0x000A817E]

Yes, well uh... tell the orderly to bring up some more beds then.

Id: [0x000A8337]
You have my thanks for your help.

Id: [0x000A833B]
Let's see, now all these patients... they also need to be moved. Where can we put them?

Id: [0x000A833C]
I believe there is room in the east ward.

Id: [0x000A833D]
Excellent. I trust you will oversee the transfer?

Id: [0x000A8343]
Here's luck.

Bit of a dead 'un, isn't it?

Id: [0x000A8349]

Id: [0x000A834B]
Oh God, look who dared to show his face.

Id: [0x000A834D]
Oh good Lord. What a bore. Do you know, he once cornered me for half an hour to talk about the Suez Canal, of all things?

Id: [0x000A834F]
What? In Egypt?

Id: [0x000A8351]
I know! As though anyone wants to hear about dusty old mummies!

Id: [0x000A8353]
Someone should pull his brains out through his nose.

Id: [0x000A8355]
Oh, you are sharp!

[chuckling]I am, rather.

Id: [0x000A835B]
EXT. STREET NEAR BUCKINGHAM PALACE

Id: [0x000A835D]
There has been a murder at the palace. I need you to be careful with this one. Anti-royalist pamphlets have been cropping up and tensions are high. The Queen is very nervous about security.

Id: [0x000A835E]
One last thing: inform the other nurses that the morgue is strictly off limits from now on. Apparently someone has been stealing body parts.

Id: [0x000A835F]
How ghastly, doctor. Who would do such a thing?

Id: [0x000A8360]
I don't know and I'm not willing to speculate. Still, keep your eyes open. There's a lot of cranks round here.

Id: [0x000A8366]
Anyway, I must be getting on with my preparation. My pupils depend on it to be able to speak.

Id: [0x000A8368]
Sorry, Evie, I've so little time.

Id: [0x000A836A]
I really must be getting on, Evie.

Id: [0x000A836C]
I would rather curtail our conversation, if you don't mind.

Please, come back, later.

Id: [0x000A8373]
The poor man! I arrived to find him here, dead as you see him. He gave his life to defend my person.

Id: [0x000A8376]
Only I know the combination. The vault contains the very precious Scepter with the Dove which I've chosen to be used in tonight's knighthood ceremony.

Id: [0x000A8379]
This evening I will knight several industrialists that have worked to end the practice of child labor. All of London's luminaries are invited.

Id: [0x000A837C]
Nonsense. If I want to have someone killed, I have people to do that for me.

Id: [0x000A8380]
[laugh]I’d better stop, Jacob, before my sides start splitting.

Id: [0x000A8382]
Sorry, Jacob, enough amusement, I’ve serious work to be getting on with..

Id: [0x000A8384]
Really, Jacob, I must get some work done.

You simply must turn away before I use the combination.

Id: [0x000A83A3]
Sorry, Jacob, I must write to my brother.

Id: [0x000A83A5]
I'd like to send off my letter before the last post.

Id: [0x000A83A7]
I can't concentrate my thoughts, I'll have to ask you to come back another time, Jacob.

Id: [0x000A83A9]
Really, Jacob, I must put pen to paper.

Id: [0x000A83AB]
Do come back, later.

Nobodies and hangers on, looks like.

Id: [0x000A83C8]
My word, who is that?

Id: [0x000A83CA]
Hmm? Oh him. Son of some lord or another. I couldn't say who.

Id: [0x000A83CC]
Really?

Id: [0x000A83CE]
Yes, well, it's a bit embarrassing, but I'm not that up on my Who's Who.

No one of any consequence.

Id: [0x000A83E1]
I say, is that--?

Id: [0x000A83E3]
My word, it is! I though he was still in India! Do you suppose he's still angry with you?

Id: [0x000A83E5]
Surely not.

Id: [0x000A83E7]
Well, you did call him a craven, jackal-hearted rascal of no breeding.

Id: [0x000A83E9]
Seems like the sort of thing that might make one carry a grudge.

Id: [0x000A83EB]
Hmm. You might have a point.

Id: [0x000A83ED]
I rather thought so.

Artie's been all in a state. Thinks there's some sort master criminal on the loose. Then this morning, he's gone!

Id: [0x000A841D]
I just want to say, I love you both. You're the best friends a girl could ask for.

Id: [0x000A841F]
And we think the world of you.

Id: [0x000A8420]
Indeed we do.

Id: [0x000A8421]
You'd better take it easy. You're likely to get drunk.

Id: [0x000A8422]
Come to think of it he had been going on about the Queen and all for the last day or two. Seemed to think she was in some sort of trouble.

Id: [0x000A8423]
What!? He's me chum!

Id: [0x000A8762]
EXT. DOYLE'S YARD

Id: [0x000A8766]
He said he was on to something. Said everything had hidden clues.

Id: [0x000A876C]
I wouldn't hurt Artie or anybody else!

Id: [0x000A8A4C]
Y'know, when he thought somethin' was important, he'd write it up in invisible ink. Lemon juice, like.

Let's find out where that syrup is made, shall we?

Id: [0x000A8F84]
There you are.

Id: [0x000A8F86]
Now to stop Soothing Syrup production once and for all.

Id: [0x000A8F88]
Time to let off some steam.

Id: [0x000A8F8A]
It's nearly ready to blow.

Id: [0x000A8F8B]
Every man for himself!

Id: [0x000A8F8D]
Where would I find the doctor?

Id: [0x000A8F8E]
How to do it?

Id: [0x000A8F8F]
Ugh... heave ho, Jacob.

Id: [0x000A8F91]
Primed and ready.

Id: [0x000A8F95]
Time for Pearl and I to have a real conversation.

Id: [0x000A8F97]
Making this formula could be rather useful.

Id: [0x000A8F98]
Deal's off, Ms. Attaway.

Id: [0x000A8F99]
GAME

Id: [0x000A8F9A]
Last call. All aboard.

Id: [0x000A8F9C]
GAME

Id: [0x000A8F9E]
Now where is that deed?

Id: [0x000A8FA7]
It's in the very top.

Id: [0x000A8FA8]
The key to the vault... and the Shroud.

Id: [0x000A8FAC]
No, no, no. Not in here!

Id: [0x000A8FAD]
Stay away from me.

Id: [0x000A900A]
GAMEPLAY - ext. outside the templar lair

Id: [0x000A900C]
I swear Miss, I don't know where they've taken him.

Id: [0x000A900E]
Taken who?

Id: [0x000A900F]
The man dressed like you. The guards dragged him off...

Id: [0x000A9010]
Henry. [beat]The plans you stole. Where are they?

Id: [0x000A9011]
I don't know anything about that!

Id: [0x000A9021]
Let's get to it then.

Id: [0x000A9023]
I agree. The sooner we can get there, the quicker we can act.

Id: [0x000A9024]
No. I wasn't always welcome... which shows how false information can be as difficult to stamp out as fishwives’ profanities at Billingsgate.

Id: [0x000A902B]
That's disgusting... Oh.[vomits]

Id: [0x000A9036]
And now to wait for the crates to be retrieved...

Id: [0x000A9049]
Here's luck.

Id: [0x000A904B]
Here's luck.

Id: [0x000A904D]
Well, a good turnout, isn't it?

Id: [0x000A904F]
Splendid.

Id: [0x000A9051]
And look who's deigned to make an appearance.

Id: [0x000A9053]
Hmph. Never expected to see them here.

Id: [0x000A9055]
Nor did I!

Id: [0x000A9057]
Well, this might prove to be an entertaining evening after all.

Id: [0x000A9059]
Perhaps there'll be another fight.

Id: [0x000A905B]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x000A905D]
Ah, but I do miss a brawl.

Id: [0x000A9075]
Let's just go.

Id: [0x000A9077]
You'd give up that easily?

Id: [0x000A9079]
What else can we do?

Id: [0x000A907D]
Oh, dear.

Id: [0x000A908A]
It's complicated.

Id: [0x000A908C]
Doesn't have to be.

Id: [0x000A9094]
Actually, I do!

Id: [0x000A9096]
You can go to hell!

Id: [0x000A909A]
Don't tell me how to talk to people.

Id: [0x000A909C]
Are you taking his side?

Id: [0x000A909E]
I can almost see what's happening!

Id: [0x000A90A0]
That’s enough! Oi, chum, keep your woman off me?

Id: [0x000A90A2]
I'm no one's woman!

Id: [0x000A90A4]
That's not what you said on our wedding day.

Id: [0x000A90A7]
No, I'm about to kick his arse.

Id: [0x000A90A9]
Get out of it! You're both animals!

Id: [0x000A90AA]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90AB]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90AD]
And then he said, "your pardon, Bishop, I thought that was the Eucharist!"

Id: [0x000A90AF]
But that makes no sense! Surely the man would be able to tell the difference between the Eucharist and a lady's handbag.

Id: [0x000A90B1]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90B3]
By God, you are thick.

Id: [0x000A90B5]
I'm not the one who can't tell the difference between the Eucharist and a lady's handbag.

Id: [0x000A90B7]
Why do I bother?

Id: [0x000A90BB]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90BC]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90BE]
Did he actually say that?

Id: [0x000A90C0]
He did! God's truth! I thought the old fellow'd be taken in a fit of apoplexy right there!

Id: [0x000A90C2]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90C4]
Ahh, remarkable.

Id: [0x000A90C6]
You really should have been there. It was quite a show.

Id: [0x000A90C8]
I'll wager it was.

Id: [0x000A90CD]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A90D1]
Look beyond the obvious, beyond surface appearances.

Id: [0x000A90D9]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90DA]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90DC]
And so my brother's being shipped off to India! Can you credit it?

Id: [0x000A90DE]
India? But, good lord, isn't he your father's heir?

Id: [0x000A90E0]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A90E2]
Not for long if the malaria gets him.

Id: [0x000A90E4]
Oh. Oh! Oh yes, I see. Well, congratulations, "your Lordship."

Id: [0x000A90E6]
[laughing]Why thank you!

Id: [0x000A90EB]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A90EF]
Nothing but a showman. So many people makes everything more dramatic!

Id: [0x000A9104]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9108]
I found the same clues you found! I knew there was to be an explosion and I led you here to save everyone. I'm as mystified as you are that nothing happened.

Id: [0x000A9112]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9116]
Seems to me you've created the perfect diversion, haven't you?

Id: [0x000A9119]
You are more naïve than you appear.

Id: [0x000A911C]
Quite right.

Id: [0x000A911D]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9121]
You've helped me herd all those dreary people to certain death! We shall hear the explosion presently.

Id: [0x000A9124]
That, my friend, makes no sense!

Id: [0x000A9132]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9136]
Never trust a man who tells you what you want to hear. He's after something!

Id: [0x000A9137]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A913B]
I brought him his invitation to the knighthood ceremony. The one with the special scepter.

Id: [0x000A913C]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9140]
A man like me can take anything he wants. Even the queen's most beloved item of all her Crown Jewels: the priceless and symbolic Scepter with the Dove.

Id: [0x000A9143]
The Scepter with the Dove, taken with your help! What could better display my genius?

Id: [0x000A9144]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9148]
I needed you to distract everyone so that I could quietly assassinate Her Majesty the Queen!

Id: [0x000A914B]
Assassinate the queen? Whatever for? No, it wasn’t that.

Id: [0x000A914C]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A9150]
While you were chasing all those people around, I absconded with the queen. A hefty ransom is now due.

Id: [0x000A9153]
It's not a bad idea. Perhaps next time!

Id: [0x000A916C]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A916D]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A916F]
You see? You see? I drink you I could told seven!

Id: [0x000A9171]
Oh yes, yes. You're an oak, all right.

Id: [0x000A9173]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A9175]
Piss on it!

Id: [0x000A9177]
There's no need to be so cross.

Id: [0x000A9179]
I'd like to see you drink seven.

Id: [0x000A917E]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A917F]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A9181]
I'm telling you, Mr. Disraeli is the best Prime Minister we've had in the last hundred years!

Id: [0x000A9183]
Oh, let's not talk about politics. Not when we've got such lovely claret to drink.

Id: [0x000A9185]
[Laughter]

Id: [0x000A9187]
True enough, my friend.

Id: [0x000A9189]
Besides, he's not a patch on Pitt the Younger.

Id: [0x000A918B]
[clearing throat]Oh for God's sake.

Id: [0x000A91B6]
The pacing is rather slower.

Id: [0x000A91B7]
Look there: that constable is haranguing a beggar. He's really laying into the poor sod.

Id: [0x000A91B8]
Wait! That rascal's pinched his helmet! He's running down the street with it!

Id: [0x000A91B9]
Whizzer!

Id: [0x000A91BB]
Goodness, look at him go. Going...

Id: [0x000A91BC]
Gone. He's 'round the corner.

Id: [0x000A91BE]
But that's a prime example of what I'm talking about. The drama of life unscripted!

Id: [0x000A91BF]
You've earned my attention. Let's see what other amusements this street will provide.

Id: [0x000A91C1]
Ah, right there!

Id: [0x000A92DB]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

No one questions you when you wear a uniform!

Id: [0x000A92E4]
I suspect the solution will turn on geometry.

Id: [0x000A92E5]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A92E9]
I am a fellow of many skills. Cracking a safe is but one!

Id: [0x000A92EC]
That wouldn't make a very good story. Something more dramatic!

Id: [0x000A92ED]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A92F1]
I simply watched the queen open the safe when you arrived!

Id: [0x000A92F4]
The dead guard was I! The spider venom allowed me to fake my death. I had a perfect view from where I lay.

Id: [0x000A92F5]
INT/EXT – WHITE ROOM

Id: [0x000A92F9]
I threaten the Queen with her very life. She told me the combination in a thrice!

Id: [0x000A92FC]
I could never bring myself to harm that old biddy.

Id: [0x000A931D]
Oh, he's fallen right on his arse! How delightful!

Id: [0x000A931E]
People are rushing to help him up but they're blocking the lane. The cart drivers are in a rage.

Id: [0x000A9320]
He punched that horse.

Id: [0x000A9321]
Yes he did.

Id: [0x000A9322]
Well, the blockage has been cleared. We'll have to find something else to watch.

Id: [0x000A9323]
I have stolen the queen's most prized possession, the Scepter with the Dove! Think of it! I have out-foxed you! The most cunning detective in Britain. I mocked you by leaving clues for you at every turning point! Now I have the Scepter, proof positive of my superiority!

Id: [0x000A9328]
Would you be so kind as to read it for us, sir.

Id: [0x000A932D]
There. You see that? I told you. Go on, tell me what else it says. Might as well know the worst.

Id: [0x000A932F]
Actually, that's all there is.

Id: [0x000A9332]
She's right. We'll be out in the street.

Id: [0x000A9334]
Nothing below.

Id: [0x000A9336]
Dum-dee-dum-de-dum... Anything?

Id: [0x000A9337]
Nothing below.

Id: [0x000A9339]
Look what we have here.

Id: [0x000A933A]
What, where?

Id: [0x000A933B]
There.

Id: [0x000A933C]
That's a woman with a parasol.

Id: [0x000A933D]
You don't think she's pretty?

Id: [0x000A933E]
I think leering at women in public is ungentlemanly.

Id: [0x000A93A6]
[inaudible whispering]

Id: [0x000A93A8]
No! With the fireplace poker?

Id: [0x000A93AA]
Indeed.

Id: [0x000A93AC]
Well, let's hope he had a good burn salve.

Id: [0x000A93AE]
And let that be a lesson to us all, never to enrage a drunken Sergeant Major of Her Majesty's 1st Bengal Fusiliers.

Id: [0x000A93B3]
[inaudible whispering]

Id: [0x000A93B5]
What? How many dogs?

Id: [0x000A93B7]
Seventeen.

Id: [0x000A93B9]
Good Lord. Think of the shedding.

Id: [0x000A93BB]
Yes, and that's to say nothing of all the furniture chewed to buggery. One wonders how he can call himself a doctor at all.

Id: [0x000A93C0]
[inaudible whispering]

Id: [0x000A93C2]
[shocked gasp]He said that?

Id: [0x000A93C4]
He did.

Id: [0x000A93C6]
But... to the Queen?

Id: [0x000A93C8]
But I'm told she found his cheek most amusing. Of course, I'm also told he was sentenced to seven years in Parkhurst.

Id: [0x000A93CD]
[inaudible whispering]

Id: [0x000A93CF]
Lemon curry?

Id: [0x000A93D1]
Indeed.

Id: [0x000A93D3]
Sounds repulsive.

Id: [0x000A93D5]
Well, my chef swears by it. Says it's the latest thing, even hoi polloi will be eating it soon. Perhaps I shouldn't have forgotten to tip him at Christmas.

Id: [0x000A93F9]
I need some help understanding your bill sir.

Id: [0x000A93FB]
Really? I thought it was all rather straightforward.

Id: [0x000A93FD]
It's more'n I expected.

Id: [0x000A93FF]
Well, you see, there were additional charges for travel. Meals and lodgings as well...

Id: [0x000A9401]
But you live right down the street, sir! How can we owe you for travel? And you're a doctor! Visiting the sick is your job!

Id: [0x000A9403]
Perhaps my assistant made an error...

Id: [0x000A9405]
You're a rotten cheat!

Id: [0x000A9407]
She means we can't pay it, sir!

Id: [0x000A9409]
I'm afraid my fees are not negotiable.

Id: [0x000A940E]
It's in all the London papers, sir!

Id: [0x000A9410]
The man was seen carrying a bloody axe...

Id: [0x000A9412]
They mention my name, sir! Right there!

Id: [0x000A9414]
Your name is a fairly common one. What makes you think they're referring to you?

Id: [0x000A9416]
Well that's what I said at first! But then I saw that they'd gone and printed my address! Look!

Id: [0x000A9418]
Hmm, yes. They do seem to mean you.

Id: [0x000A941A]
He ain't no murderer!

Id: [0x000A941C]
It's slander! That's what!

Id: [0x000A941E]
You must ignore it.

Id: [0x000A9423]
Here it is, sir. The latest edition.

Id: [0x000A9425]
Well, let me just see what I can find.

Id: [0x000A9427]
Take your time, sir!

Id: [0x000A9429]
It seems they've missed a 'u' in labour, and misused an apostrophe here.

Id: [0x000A942B]
What did I tell you? Sir, I told her you can spot an error in print from across the room! I did!

Id: [0x000A942D]
Remarkably, I don't see any others.

Id: [0x000A942F]
Looks like I owe him a joey.

Id: [0x000A9431]
I told her so!

Id: [0x000A9438]
I'm afraid I don't understand it a bit, sir.

Id: [0x000A943A]
This letter is all in French.

Id: [0x000A943C]
And what does it say?

Id: [0x000A943E]
Well, uh, this word means 'fish', and I think this one means... cake?

Id: [0x000A9440]
There. I told you. Our neighbor has been signalling with candles at night. She's a French spy. This proves it!

Id: [0x000A9442]
Well I don't see anything about politics but...

Id: [0x000A9444]
I never liked her!

Id: [0x000A9446]
It's evidence, wouldn't you say sir?

Id: [0x000A9448]
I'll leave you to report it to the police.

Id: [0x000A946E]
No, no. She's not there anymore.

Id: [0x000A9472]
I think I'll take to fatherhood like a duck to water!

Id: [0x000A9483]
[inaudible whispering]

Id: [0x000A9485]
Not the Vicar, surely!

Id: [0x000A9487]
The Vicar too.

Id: [0x000A9489]
Disgraceful!

Id: [0x000A948B]
Well, that's a country squire for you, isn't it? No sense of decorum or propriety. What do you expect?

Id: [0x000A948F]
Here's to your health, and to the health of all our endeavors!

Id: [0x000A9491]
Hear hear!

Id: [0x000A9496]
Good gracious! What kind of a bird was that? Look there, up there!

Id: [0x000A9497]
That's a bit of newspaper, you dolt.

Id: [0x000A9498]
Oh. [pauses] Well, you can hardly blame me for trying to bring a bit of excitement to this dreary street.

Id: [0x000A949A]
Ooh! There, there!

Id: [0x000A949B]
What? What did you see?

Id: [0x000A949C]
That organ grinder's monkey just snatched a sweet from the baby in the pram.

Id: [0x000A949D]
How do you know that wasn't, say, an eagle I saw earlier?

Id: [0x000A949E]
Would you forget the eagle! Look at the monkey!

Id: [0x000A94A9]
A toast, then, to all the fruits of our labors! To wealth, to privilege, and of course the Queen!

Id: [0x000A94AB]
The Queen!

Id: [0x000A94B0]
Ah, do you see that deep burgundy color? The way the light catches? Lovely.

Id: [0x000A94B2]
Here's luck.

Id: [0x000A94B7]
Here's what every woman's got, what every man has not got, what we all get out of, and what we all like to get into!

Id: [0x000A94B9]
I'll drink to that!

Id: [0x000A94BE]
Ah, look at that. Lovely vintage. See the clarity? Well, here's a go!

I've heard of your type. You're a spiritualist, aren't? All right then, wot's me dead ma thinking right now?

Id: [0x000A961E]
Sir, spiritualism is a science, not a children's game. Now my book will enable you to speak to your mother if you so desire.

Id: [0x000A961F]
[laughs]

Id: [0x000A9620]
Joke's on you, friend. My mum ain't even dead. I'm a sharper meself and I know when I'm bein' hoaxed. Push off.

Id: [0x000A9621]
Wait a tick. Doesn't the Queen try to speak to her dear Albert? Perhaps you could sell her a copy.

Id: [0x000A9622]
You're joking.

Id: [0x000A9623]
Of course he is, you neddy.

And so then... then I replaced all his sleeve links with cravat pins!

Id: [0x000A9648]
[laughing]

Id: [0x000A964A]
He was so confused, you should have seen him.

Id: [0x000A9658]

Id: [0x000A965A]
Wait, wait--isn't he your cousin? On your mother's side?

Id: [0x000A965C]
[laughing]He is.

Id: [0x000A965E]
And he never noticed you?

Id: [0x000A9660]
You hoaxed your cousin with a false moustache and assumed name?

Id: [0x000A9662]
[laughter]I did indeed!

Id: [0x000A9663]
[laughter]

Id: [0x000A9665]
Well, he never was the brightest member of the family.

Id: [0x000A9667]
Does he play cards perchance? I could use an opportunity to replenish my purse.

Id: [0x000A966C]
[snickering, trying to hold in laughter]

Id: [0x000A966E]
Oh, this is rich! Did you see what he was wearing?

Id: [0x000A9670]
[laughing]

Id: [0x000A9672]
What is that?

Id: [0x000A9674]
My God, is that an autumn cut?

Id: [0x000A9676]
[laughter]

Id: [0x000A9677]
[laughter]

Id: [0x000A9679]
He looks a proper Judy!

Id: [0x000A967B]
Perhaps I should offer him the name of my tailor. Ah, pearls before swine.

Id: [0x000A9743]
[to Jacob]Ah, Desmond. And Mr. Frye! I'd like you to meet... I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

Id: [0x000A9941]
Yeah, he never does.

Id: [0x000A9943]
You don't think he stole it, do you?

Id: [0x000A9945]
I can't believe he's having another one.

Id: [0x000A9947]
In any case - do you think it's stolen? I don't want the rozzers knocking on my door.

Id: [0x000A9949]
I'll wager it's an heirloom he's selling to pay a debt.

Id: [0x000A994F]
What if it isn't? Imagine if I were caught with stolen goods

In all London. That's what I said.

And then I swear to you I saw her run across the rooftops.

Id: [0x000A9A24]
You were dreaming.

Id: [0x000A9A26]
I said that you wouldn't believe me.

Id: [0x000A9A28]
There's something odd about that fellow.

Id: [0x000A9A2A]
Yeah, try to concentrate, can you? I'm telling you, I saw it. Nimble as a chimney-sweep, she was.

Id: [0x000A9A2C]
She probably WAS a chimney-sweep.

Id: [0x000A9A2E]
How would you know? You weren't even there. I'm telling the truth.

Id: [0x000A9A30]
Another of your stories, that is.

They must be open. Look!

If they was open, the door wouldn't be locked, now would it?

Oh! Oh! Have they opened yet? Let me see!

Id: [0x000A9A58]
Oi, what's your problem mate? Piss off!

Id: [0x000A9C47]
Well, it's nice to see you back in this part of town.

Id: [0x000A9C49]
I come back for the beer every time.

Id: [0x000A9C4B]
What, are you not here for the pleasant conversation? I've a good mind to be upset about that.

Id: [0x000A9C4D]
Aw, I don't mean that. You're a topper, you are!

Id: [0x000A9C4F]
Well! I think you've had a few too many.

Id: [0x000A9C51]

Id: [0x000A9C5E]
Don't change the subject. I was telling you about seeing the Queen!

Id: [0x000A9C60]
Yes, yes. Do go on.

Id: [0x000A9C62]
"Do go on." You'll look a fool when I get my knighthood.

Is it because the British Empire's in the east but the sun sets in the west?

The bridge is closed by order of the Captain. Car accident.

Why don't we just move the vehicles out of the way? This new captain's got some funny ideas.

Id: [0x000A9E3E]
You ask me, there's something fishy about this accident. Captain's acting strangely too.

Id: [0x000A9E3F]
Why won't they let us through? It's just a few cars.

Id: [0x000A9E40]
How did the accident happen? Someone told me they saw an explosion.

Id: [0x000A9E41]
Well, this is just dandy. There could be bombs falling from the sky and they go and close the bloody bridge.

He tried to pay us threepence a day, as if a man could live on that.

There's a bitter wind blowing in off the North Sea. I wouldn't want to be on any of these boats.

Don't just stand there. Get a move on!

How many more shipments are due in today?

Id: [0x000AA287]
Is someone going to clean up that mess?

Id: [0x000AA288]
My back is killing me today.

Id: [0x000AA289]
I know someone who snatches a look at the warehouse books now and then. They’re making a fair bob or two out of us.

Id: [0x000AA28A]
These long shifts are going to kill me.

Id: [0x000AA28B]
That lot's off to the spice-grinder.

Id: [0x000AA28C]
The next lots are marble and rubber.

Us dock workers should stick together. Form a union, like the carpenters and riggers have.

Id: [0x000AA28E]
I tell you, if ever the dock owner showed up one day I'd give him a piece of my mind.

Id: [0x000AA28F]
I was tallying up ships yesterday. Over a hundred docked before I lost count of 'em.

Id: [0x000AA290]
Smell that? Plums, figs, oranges, spice... The British Empire right on our dock.

I thought that zeppelin would kill me.

Id: [0x000AA294]
I fell as I was running away.

Id: [0x000AA295]
How long before we can see the doctor?

Id: [0x000AA296]
I woke up on the floor. The bombing was over.

Id: [0x000AA297]
I think my hand is broken.

Id: [0x000AA298]
Some great oaf knocked me aside when the zeppelin appeared. Almost pushed me into the river.

Id: [0x000AA299]
I have burns all along my legs.

Id: [0x000AA29A]
Thank god I managed to escape the building before it collapsed on me.

Id: [0x000AA29B]
Nurse! I need to see the nurse!

Id: [0x000AA29C]
The last thing I remember is that zepp appearing.

Id: [0x000AA29D]
I’m deaf in one ear. The bomb fell less than a hundred yards away from where I stood.

Id: [0x000AA29E]
What if they attack again?

Id: [0x000AA29F]
I’ll be alright. Just a few broken bones.

Id: [0x000AA2A0]
I need to get patched up and back on the street.

Id: [0x000AA2A3]
Now look here, if you tell anyone about us...

Id: [0x000AA2A5]
Why would I tell anyone?!

Id: [0x000AA2A7]
I know. I just have to warn you.

Id: [0x000AA2A9]
W-What did you tell her?

Id: [0x000AA2AB]
She doesn't know a thing, I promise!

Id: [0x000AA2AD]
Why must your wife always stick her nose into affairs that are none of her concern?

Id: [0x000AA2AF]
I can hardly blame her! You, on the other hand, should have been more careful about leaving your garments scattered about the bedroom. You jeopardized the both of us!

Id: [0x000AA2B1]
What can I say, Nevin, really?

Id: [0x000AA2B4]
It-it won't work.

Id: [0x000AA2B6]
Edward, what good does it do us to have a man in Parliament if he is ineffectual?

Id: [0x000AA2B8]
Try to understand.

Id: [0x000AA2BA]
Absurd!

Id: [0x000AA2BC]
This will just go on and on, won't it? We're fated to hide forever.

Id: [0x000AA2C3]
He's only one man. I can't even ask him to address the issue lest I risk exposing myself. Then what would happen to us?

Id: [0x000AA2C4]
If it's not our time, it's not our time.

Id: [0x000AA2C5]
That's not good enough.

Oh, my poor Freddy. They say he could lose a leg.

Id: [0x000AA2CA]
I just wish the doctors could tell me more.

Id: [0x000AA2CB]
I’m waiting to see my son. He was in such pain. Poor Tim!

Id: [0x000AA2CC]
Nurse! Any word on my son?

Id: [0x000AA2CD]
My mother is seventy-six years old. She’s very frail.

Id: [0x000AA2CE]
We’re lucky the bombs landed where they did. It could have been worse.

Id: [0x000AA2CF]
How is my wife? Can somebody tell me, please?

Id: [0x000AA2D0]
The Germans will pay for this. You mark my words.

Id: [0x000AA2D1]
I’m here to see Captain Smith. Fine fellow. Almost lost his head in that attack.

Id: [0x000AA2D2]
I’ve lost a lot of good men over the years, but I never expected to lose any on the streets of London.

Id: [0x000AA2D3]
The doctor says they have to operate on her. What if she doesn’t make it?

Id: [0x000AA2D4]
I don't see why they couldn't have taken him to a real hospital.

Id: [0x000AA2D5]
They had better get Sam back on his feet. A good servant is hard to find these days.

Id: [0x000AA2D6]
I demand to see someone who can tell us what’s going on.

Id: [0x000AA2D8]

Id: [0x000AA2DA]
And his cravat?

Id: [0x000AA2DC]
Really! He blew his nose into it.

Oh, but we must not speak ill of the dead.

Of course. God rest his soul and all that.

I'll wait here for your return.

Are you coming back?

The Paris facility was completely destroyed, along with our best samples. All that work, lost forever. With that in mind, these are notes towards increased efforts in locating new Precursor samples.

Id: [0x000AA37C]
I want to merge Industry and Entertainment in the hearts and minds of the public. Every product and service Abstergo offers should be sending user data to Helix for us to look through.

Id: [0x000AA37E]
That will be a tough sell to a public who is already scared of Big Brother. So we will sell them on Big Mother.

Id: [0x000AA380]
Nobody likes it when the government snoops on our social media, but everyone’s wearing an Abstergo Bodyband fitness monitor.

Id: [0x000AA382]
What about an Abstergo Stenographer? We take a sample from the plaintiff and defendant, and then relive the case through the Animus?

Id: [0x000AA384]
Yes, that’s what I want. I’ll ask Mr. Rikkin to lean on the Justice Department to get samples from the prison population as well.

Under Melanie Lemay's watch, Abstergo Entertainment has more users than ever. That’s great, but that’s still a pretty small user base.

But we need to expand our demographics. Not a lot of virtual feature enthusiasts in the octogenarian set.

Id: [0x000AA391]
So let’s make products that appeal to them. I want to create a digital wake where people can show the loved ones they leave behind their best memories together.

I came to gloat, actually. Look at this data.

A Sage!

Id: [0x000AA39D]
It gets better. Check the data from his patrilineal line.

Id: [0x000AA39F]
Let’s see. Patrilineal Line. Nineteenth century American Midwest. Eighteenth century American Revolution. Sixteenth century, Ottoman Empire. Fifteenth Century, Italian Renaissance. My God. You don’t mean?

Id: [0x000AA3A1]
Yeah. The best part? His mother just walked him into one of your new clinics in New York City.

Id: [0x000AA3A4]
I’d really like to strip him for parts like we did with Subject 17!

Id: [0x000AA3A5]
Oh, no you don't. You had your chance with the Shroud. This asset is mine, and I won't be a party to the needless mutilation of a ten-year old boy! It's inhumane!

Id: [0x000AA3A6]
That's terribly old fashioned. In any case, we should send Sigma Team to recover him.

Id: [0x000AA3A8]
No. I'm going to keep an eye on him for now. We’ll collect him when the time is right.

Id: [0x000AA3AF]
I could just stay in this moment forever. This is home enough for me.

Let me warm you up, my dear.

No.

Then you'd better come closer. The chill will pass.

Id: [0x000AA3F1]
You tried that on the first carriage ride we shared. Do you remember?

Then I shall move it back. The tingling's subsided, anyway.

I'm getting quite tired of having to explain it.

There's no need.

No, I think we're all in agreement here.

Id: [0x000AA490]
Of course we are.

Now as I was saying, I really think it will be brought before parliament again, but I don't know if the results will be any different from the last time.

If - if - we can convince John that June had been unfaithful, then he would petition for a divorce. Simple as that, and she would be free!

Convincing is not enough. He must prove her to be unfaithful!

Id: [0x000AA49B]
You know it's true. The court won't believe it without evidence. June, tell me you agree with me.

Id: [0x000AA49E]
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

Id: [0x000AA4A0]
Is it?

Id: [0x000AA4A2]
I can't tolerate this any longer. David, we must free June from that abusive monster, law be damned!

What?

Id: [0x000AA4AB]
Oh, Lord!

June, I know you detest violence, but I can see no other way to help you. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x000AA4AF]
However John deserts is none of my concern. But in my opinion, there is no other way for you, June.

Id: [0x000AA4B1]
I understand.

Id: [0x000AA4B3]
David, I think we can agree, this conversation has never taken place. I wish you luck.

Id: [0x000AA4B5]

Id: [0x000AA4B7]

See here! I'm about ready to throw myself off one of these buildings!

Id: [0x000AA52B]
That's hardly necessary, Adam!

Id: [0x000AA52D]
How can you say that?

Id: [0x000AA532]
What do you think?

Id: [0x000AA534]
To be honest, I found the prose to be trite, the characters meaningless, and the story preposterous.

Id: [0x000AA536]
I completely disagree. I was transported. Utterly transported.

Id: [0x000AA538]
You have all the taste God gave a choleric goat.

Id: [0x000AA53A]

You're never impressed with anything!

Id: [0x000AA53E]
That's not true, let me see that.

Id: [0x000AA540]
Yes, I'm quite impressed by the typography. See?

Id: [0x000AA542]
Hmm... yes, very nice.

Id: [0x000AA544]
Typography? You are a sad lot.

Id: [0x000AA546]
No, we merely have taste.

Id: [0x000AA548]
I have taste!

Id: [0x000AA54A]
No, you have appetites. There's a difference.

Hm? Oh, yes. I record everything I do. Never know when an unexpected breakthrough will happen. How are you?

Id: [0x000AA55A]
Terrible. I’ve been tasked with archiving the genetic memories from Project Legacy.

Well, it’s a shame how that ended, but I’m glad to see the data isn’t going to waste.

Id: [0x000AA55C]
It's a waste of my time and talent. Just as your current assignment is a waste of yours.

Id: [0x000AA55D]
Work is work! Despite the setbacks in Denver, the Eye-Abstergo Satellite is a very interesting --

Id: [0x000AA55E]
Vidic had his chance and he’s blown it. They’ll never find a new Apple in time for launch. The Animus project is dead in the water.

Id: [0x000AA55F]
Meanwhile, you and I are members of the Inner Sanctum and we're being treated like sodding interns!

Id: [0x000AA561]
But what if we could give Mr. Rikkin a new, working Piece of Eden?

Id: [0x000AA562]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x000AA563]
Don't listen: Look. Look at this.

Id: [0x000AA565]
P.E. #66! Where did it come from?

Id: [0x000AA566]
The Project Legacy data revealed that the company acquired it in the forties. I want you to help me get it working again.

Id: [0x000AA568]
This fabric. It’s very fragile. But there’s technology in it!

Id: [0x000AA569]
You study the Shroud. Find out anything you can about its original purpose and methods of use.

Id: [0x000AA56A]
I’ll cross-reference the genetic memories from Project Legacy against my archive. With any luck I can locate more people who came into contact with it.

Id: [0x000AA56B]
Together, we can unlock the artifact’s secrets!

Id: [0x000AA56C]
I get to play with an artifact AND take Vidic down a peg? How can I refuse?

Id: [0x000AA56D]
int. ABSTERGO FACILITY

Id: [0x000AA570]
You called me all the way to Paris for this madness?

Id: [0x000AA571]
Listen, it's been months and we are no closer to getting the Shroud to work!

Id: [0x000AA572]
The microscopic technology in its fibres is similar to what we’ve found in other Pieces of Eden, an alloy we’ve dubbed “Pathorytka.” This alloy seems to react specifically to thought. But the artifact itself remains inert.

Id: [0x000AA573]
That’s still no reason for this course of action. What if the Shroud doesn’t save you?

Id: [0x000AA574]
Do you know just how much of Abstergo's money we've embezzled into our secret project here? Because I'm sure Mr. Rikkin’s noticed by now. And if we have nothing to show for it...

Id: [0x000AA576]
So I’m going to wrap myself in the Shroud. And you’re going to do what needs to be done.

Id: [0x000AA577]
And one way or another, our current dilemma will be resolved.

Id: [0x000AA579]
Fine.

Id: [0x000AA57B]
[gurgle]

Id: [0x000AA57D]
Well, shit.

Id: [0x000AA57F]
Oh!

Id: [0x000AA581]
I AM CONSUS! THE ERUDITE GOD!

Id: [0x000AA582]
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!

Id: [0x000AA583]
int. ABSTERGO FACILITY

Id: [0x000AA586]
I’m not happy about this at all.

Id: [0x000AA587]
Why must you always shoot yourself in the head to summon the Precursor consciousness?

Id: [0x000AA588]
Because it works! I tried slitting my wrists, nothing. I tried overdosing on pills. I had to get my stomach pumped. It was all very unpleasant. It has to be a major wound for the artifact to activate.

Id: [0x000AA589]
The risk is unacceptable. Without you, there is no Future Technology division. So I’ve brought you a qualified volunteer.

Id: [0x000AA58E]
I’m Agent Violet da Costa. It’s an honor to meet you, sir.

Id: [0x000AA58F]
Is it? I tried to recruit you once, and you turned me down for Sigma Team.

Id: [0x000AA590]
I thought I could do more good in the field.

Id: [0x000AA591]
Horseshit. A dazzling brain like yours is going to waste.

Id: [0x000AA592]
Agent da Costa is assigned to you for six months. Make the most of it.

Id: [0x000AA593]
Then let's get started! Wrap yourself in the artifact, please!

Id: [0x000AA595]
I know HOW to summon the Precursor. But I’ve never been able to communicate with him.

Id: [0x000AA596]
This is going to be an interrogation.

Id: [0x000AA597]
Bingo!

Id: [0x000AA598]
If it's all the same to you, I'm going to leave before the mess.

Id: [0x000AA59A]
Mess? What did she mean by --

Id: [0x000AA59D]
I AM CONSUS THE ERUDITE GOD

Id: [0x000AA59E]
Yes, hello! I want to know more about you. Tell me: Did you create the Shroud?

Id: [0x000AA59F]
WHEN I WAS FLESH, I APPRENTICED WITH HEPHASTUS. A MAKER. THE WAR OF UNIFICATION RAGED. WE CREATED DEVASTATING SWORDS TO END IT. BUT THEN: GUILT. I CREATED SHROUDS. TO HEAL.

Id: [0x000AA5A0]
I suspected that it may have been a tool to treat casualties of war. How does the Shroud heal such terrible damage?

Id: [0x000AA5A1]
THE BODY IS A CONSTRUCT. A MACHINE. BLUEPRINTS STORED WITHIN. SHROUDS ACCESS THESE RECOVERY CENTERS. REPAIRS DAMAGE TO SPECIFICATIONS.

Id: [0x000AA5A2]
A factory reset. Wait. Shrouds? There's more than this one?

Id: [0x000AA5A3]
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL. MY PROTOTYPE. CREATED IN THE YEAR 1923 OF THE ISU ERA.

Id: [0x000AA5A4]
Isu Era? I have so many questions. But let's stick with you. How is it that your mind resides in this artifact?

Id: [0x000AA5A5]
I WAS OLD. I WANTED MORE TIME. BODIES ARE CONSTRUCTS. MINDS ARE PROGRAMS. UPLOADED MY PROGRAM INTO THIS SHROUD. TO CHEAT DEATH. SUCCEEDED. FAILED.

Id: [0x000AA5A6]
TRAPPED IN MY PROTOTYPE. TRAPPED IN MY FORGOTTEN LAB. ALIVE. AWAKE. CANNOT SPEAK. ONLY WATCH.

Id: [0x000AA5A7]
Generations?! How long have you been --

Id: [0x000AA5A8]
THE DAMAGE IS REPAIRED. REST NOW.

Id: [0x000AA5AB]
int. ABSTERGO FACILITY

Id: [0x000AA5AE]
You look distracted.

Id: [0x000AA5AF]
We were supposed to launch the Eye Abstergo satellite today. Ah, what might have been!

Id: [0x000AA5B0]
So here we are. Our final session together.

Id: [0x000AA5B1]
I'm not going to miss getting shot in the face, but...

Id: [0x000AA5B2]
Yes?

Id: [0x000AA5B3]
Having Consus in my head is the craziest fucking thing. But it's also... soothing somehow. Is it weird that I’m going to miss that?

Id: [0x000AA5B4]
I’ll let you in on a secret. I talk to him when no one else is around.

Id: [0x000AA5B5]
I know what you mean.

Id: [0x000AA5B7]
Well, let’s say our goodbyes and get you on your way.

Id: [0x000AA5BA]
I AM CONSUS THE ERUDITE GOD.

Id: [0x000AA5BB]
Violet is leaving us today, Consus.

Id: [0x000AA5BC]
EVERYTHING IS IMPERMANENT. JASON. GIOVANNI BORGIA. WILLIAM WOODMAN. HERE THEN GONE.

Id: [0x000AA5BD]
I simply thought you might like to say goodbye.

Id: [0x000AA5BE]
IT IS GOOD TO TALK AGAIN. TO BRUSH UP AGAINST ANOTHER MIND. EVEN SIMPLE ONES SUCH AS YOURS.

Id: [0x000AA5BF]
I’ll choose to ignore that.

Id: [0x000AA5C0]
YOU ARE MARVELOUS CREATIONS. EXCEEDED YOUR PROGRAMMING. MADE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING. FLAWED BUT BOLD. I APPROVE.

Id: [0x000AA5C2]
What the hell..?

Id: [0x000AA5C3]
THE GRAND TEMPLE IS OPEN. SHE LIES IN WAIT NO LONGER. SHE IS FREE!

Id: [0x000AA5C5]
It is done. The world is saved. You played your part well, Desmond. But now… Now it’s time that I played mine.

Id: [0x000AA5C6]
MINERVA HAS FAILED. ALL IS LOST.

Id: [0x000AA5C7]
What was that? Answer me!

Id: [0x000AA5C8]
THE DAMAGE IS REPAIRED. REST.

Id: [0x000AA5CA]
What the hell was that?

Id: [0x000AA5CB]
int. ABSTERGO FACILITY

Id: [0x000AA5CF]
I put enough tranquilizers in Gramática’s coffee to knock out a whale.

Id: [0x000AA5D0]
Good. You’ll be back in Montreal as soon as we’re done here.

Id: [0x000AA5D1]
So the only question is: Who’s getting shot in the face?

Id: [0x000AA5D3]
Of course.

Id: [0x000AA5D5]
Okay. Let’s do this.

Id: [0x000AA5D8]
Master Berg! Explain yourself.

Id: [0x000AA5D9]
How the fuck are you up and about?

Id: [0x000AA5DA]
Please. I shit better drugs than whatever weak tea you spiked me with. I take it this isn’t an official Sigma Team mission?

Id: [0x000AA5DB]
Juno has an entire cult of worshippers under her thrall. The Inner Sanctum may not see a threat. I do.

Id: [0x000AA5DC]
Sigma Team’s been disbanded. You’ve both been reassigned to the Phoenix Project, and yet here you are, defying orders by breaking into my facility and trying to interrogate a Precursor.

Id: [0x000AA5DD]
I knew I liked you for a reason, Berg. Proceed.

Id: [0x000AA5DE]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000AA5E1]
I AM CONSUS THE ERUDITE GOD.

Id: [0x000AA5E2]
Tell me everything you know about the one called Juno.

Id: [0x000AA5E3]
JUNO. THE SCHEMER. THREE CENTURIES  AFTER MY DEATH. SHE FOUND ME. USURPED MY WORK. USED IT FOR HER OWN ENDS.

Id: [0x000AA5E4]
HE WHO IS THE IMAGE OF AITA. HE WILL HERALD HER RETURN.

Id: [0x000AA5E5]
Juno wants to exterminate us.

Id: [0x000AA5E6]
PERHAPS ONCE. YOUR UPRISING WAS AN AFFRONT. BUT AFTER THE CATASTROPHE. EVERYTHING CHANGED.

Id: [0x000AA5E7]
Explain.

Id: [0x000AA5E8]
I CANNOT. SHE VANISHED. PLANS SET IN MOTION. SHE LAY IN WAIT.

Id: [0x000AA5E9]
Then hypothesize. What does she want?

Id: [0x000AA5EA]
HYPOTHESIS IRRELEVANT. CIVILIZATIONS CRUMBLE. FLESH DECAYS. EVERYTHING IS IMPERMANENT. EXCEPT THE GRAY AREA INSIDE OF SYSTEMS. THE CONNECTIONS.

Id: [0x000AA5EB]
Precursor minds are powerful. If Juno is inside of a network, she could control it.

Id: [0x000AA5EC]
And the planet grows more networked every day.

Id: [0x000AA5ED]
You were right to be concerned. This merits further study.

Id: [0x000AA5EE]
int. ABSTERGO FACILITY

Id: [0x000AA5F2]
What's up, Doc! Love the new work space.

Id: [0x000AA5F3]
Violet! What a lovely surprise.

Id: [0x000AA5F4]
Can’t stay. I’m just here with a special delivery.

Id: [0x000AA5F6]
Oh. Oh, you didn’t.

Id: [0x000AA5F7]
Oh yes I did.

Id: [0x000AA5F8]
This is the dear departed John Standish? The Sage?

Id: [0x000AA5F9]
Consider it a thank you gift from Mr. Berg. But we have a request.

Id: [0x000AA5FA]
I can’t bring him back to life. The Shroud doesn’t work that way.

Id: [0x000AA5FB]
We know your primary goal of the Phoenix Project is to sequence Precursor DNA. Reverse engineer artifacts and all that good shit.

Id: [0x000AA5FC]
But we want you to make something for us. A body.

Id: [0x000AA5FD]
Even with this Sage, a viable clone is still decades away.

Id: [0x000AA5FE]
Then the sooner we get started, the better. Can it be done?

Id: [0x000AA5FF]
I don't know! But I can't wait to find out!

Id: [0x000AA601]
int. ABSTERGO FACILITY

Id: [0x000AA604]
I tell you, Consus, between the Standish sample and the recovered blood vials from Bartholomew Roberts's stash, we're pulling incredible data.

Id: [0x000AA605]
The promotions are nice. The work is amazing. But there's so much managerial bullshit to deal with now.

Id: [0x000AA606]
It's enough to make me miss the days where all I had to do was get shot in the face.

Id: [0x000AA608]
Doctor Gramática, can you hear me?

Id: [0x000AA609]
Violet? What a –

Id: [0x000AA60A]
Shut up! No time. There's a team of Assassins on your doorstep.

Id: [0x000AA60B]
But my clones, the Shroud!

Id: [0x000AA60C]
I’ve dispatched Sigma Team but they’re going to be too late!

Id: [0x000AA60E]
Get out of there! Double time!

Id: [0x000AA610]
Galina can you keep them off my back please? I'm trying to steal their data before their servers go up in flames.

Id: [0x000AA611]
Templar scum!

Id: [0x000AA613]
Nice to see you having fun!

Id: [0x000AA615]
Hello! We're here to destroy your abominable samples and... wait.

Id: [0x000AA616]
Are you wearing a blanket?

Id: [0x000AA617]
Is it fireproof?

Id: [0x000AA618]
No, wait! That's the --

Id: [0x000AA61A]

I'm with you, Arthur!

Everyone with any power is against us! We'll never get on!

Don't whinge, mate, it's feeble.

It's just not fair, is it?

Id: [0x000AA638]
Hello, Alvaro.

Id: [0x000AA639]
What the hell do you want.

Id: [0x000AA63A]
Don't look so glum! Let me tell you what I've been working on lately.

Id: [0x000AA63B]
We sent Berg to India last year to chase a lead involving the Koh-i-Noor. It was a dead end, but we did manage to find some data on an Assassin from the 1800s. Arbaaz Mir.

Id: [0x000AA63C]
And?

Id: [0x000AA63D]
And, while that's all very interesting, when we looked further into his genetic line, we found this.

Id: [0x000AA63F]
Abraaz Mir's son was in London. So what?

Id: [0x000AA640]
Look closer.

Id: [0x000AA641]
Blah blah "assumed name Henry Green," blah blah... "seems he and the Assassins were searching for"... oh my God. You found another one.

Id: [0x000AA642]
My teams are working outward from this sample. We've scoured Helix and tracked down a set of memories from the Grand Master of the British Rite, Crawford Starrick. We're also looking for data on other Assassins of the era.

Id: [0x000AA643]
Do you have anyone searching for the new Shroud?

Id: [0x000AA644]
No one yet. You want to call in Berg?

Id: [0x000AA645]
As soon as humanly possible!

Id: [0x000AA646]
So what do you plan to do with him?

Id: [0x000AA647]
Given his unique lineage, I think we should put him in an Animus for the next fifty years. Think of the data we could extract!

Id: [0x000AA64B]
Forgive me for repeating it.

Id: [0x000AA65C]
Your meaning eludes me.

Id: [0x000AA65E]
Rubbish! When will you let go of the past, Seward?

Id: [0x000AA660]
When will you let go of this subject?

Id: [0x000AA662]
Your little spill made a fool out of me. I was covered in claret the rest of the night-

Id: [0x000AA664]
I apologized for the accident immediately, sir!

Id: [0x000AA666]
Accident, you say?

Id: [0x000AA668]
I do say!

Id: [0x000AA66A]
Nonsense!

Id: [0x000AA66C]
Why are you pestering me?

Id: [0x000AA66E]
Ha!

Id: [0x000AA670]
Is this about money?

Id: [0x000AA672]
You cannot buy your way out of this one!

No, this is war!

Yes, Your Highness!

Id: [0x000AA67E]
That's your problem, Seward. You can never accept responsibility with any sincerity.

Why is that? Look, they have honeycomb, flat-

Id: [0x000AA6A0]
I can't help it. It upsets my stomach. Never touching the stuff again.

Id: [0x000AA6A2]
You're bothered that tripe is the stomach lining of a cow?

Id: [0x000AA6A4]
Yes?

Id: [0x000AA6A6]
Nothing, nothing.

Id: [0x000AA6A8]
Tripe is stomach lining? How can that be?

Oh, good Lord!

It's not Christmas, dear.

Perhaps there's another shop with a more appealing selection.

Id: [0x000AA6EF]
Perhaps there is.

Id: [0x000AA6FA]
No, you see, the whale in Moby Dick clearly symbolizes Ireland.

It makes perfect sense!

Oh, bravo! Very clever indeed!

How dare you, Seward? The men at the firm won't look me in the eye! Because of your venomous tongue, they think I should be confined to a lock hospital!

Id: [0x000AB7BB]
I...I...

Id: [0x000AB7BD]
I told you about my one dalliance in confidence.

Id: [0x000AB7BF]
The firm has a right to know if anyone is in danger of infection from you.

Id: [0x000AB7C1]
Bollocks!

Id: [0x000AB7C3]
Don't stand so near.

Id: [0x000AB918]
A pleasure, Your Highness.

Id: [0x000ABDC0]
More claret?

Id: [0x000ABDC2]
One moment.

Id: [0x000ABDC4]
I'll have some, then.

Id: [0x000ABDC6]
Ready?

Id: [0x000ABDC8]
[affirmative]Mm.

Id: [0x000ABDCA]
What do you think, Marcello's for dinner later?

Id: [0x000ABDCC]
We ate there just last week. How about an alamode beef-house?

Id: [0x000ABDCE]
Not very romantic.

Id: [0x000ABDD0]
Damn romance, I want meat.

Id: [0x000ABDE7]
It makes every difference! We're talking about the future of the British Empire. You should make an effort to understand.

Id: [0x000ABDE9]
These place names you allow to confuse you are a window into business opportunities. Just think of the money you could make with some well-timed investments.

Id: [0x000ABDED]
You think I'm not fit for promotion.

Id: [0x000ABDEF]
That's correct.

Id: [0x000ABDF1]
How shocking, then, that they would decide to name me Head Accountant.

Id: [0x000ABDF3]
Well, congratulations, my Lord!

Id: [0x000ABDF5]
Ha!

Id: [0x000ABDF7]
Has your home life done nothing to humble you? I would have imagined it would be difficult to jape when you're a known cuckold.

Id: [0x000ABDF9]
[gasp]

Id: [0x000ABDFB]
That was assault!

Id: [0x000ABDFD]
It was!

Id: [0x000ABDFF]
Let's involve the police, shall we?

Id: [0x000ABE09]
Hmm.

Id: [0x000ABE0E]
I'll send for the police!

Id: [0x000ABE10]
All right. You do that.

Id: [0x000ABE12]
[gasp]

Id: [0x000ABE14]
And you can be sure the police - and everyone else - will learn all about your proclivities!

Id: [0x000ABFED]
[woozy groan]

Id: [0x000ABFEF]
Darling? Are you all right?

Id: [0x000ABFF1]
Just a bit dizzy.

Id: [0x000ABFF3]
Poor dear. Just sit a moment and catch your breath.

Id: [0x000ABFF5]
Yes, I think that's a good idea.

Id: [0x000ABFF7]
[kiss]Better?

Id: [0x000ABFF9]
Yes, it seems to have passed now.

Id: [0x000ABFFB]
We'll wait a bit just to be sure.

Id: [0x000AC000]
Oh, I'm delighted you agree.

Id: [0x000AC001]
You look weird with a weapon.

Id: [0x000AC004]

Id: [0x000AC006]
Please.

Id: [0x000AC008]
There we are.

Id: [0x000AC00A]
Thank you, darling.

Id: [0x000AC00C]
My pleasure.

Id: [0x000AC00F]
What?

Id: [0x000AC012]
Give that back at once! Come now, we agreed!

Id: [0x000AC014]
Surely we can read it together?

Id: [0x000AC018]
Here's luck, darling.

Id: [0x000AC01A]
To you as well!

Id: [0x000AC01C]

Londoners of all ages! Hear me! If you are tired! Hear me! If you are hungry, hear me!

Id: [0x000AC06E]
It's almost an absolute fact: Prince Albert was ruddy murdered by order of the Queen. Why hasn't anyone put her away?

Id: [0x000AC070]
You're out of your mind, mate. The Queen would not have had her husband killed.

Id: [0x000AC072]
He had typhoid, and no one else in the palace was afflicted? Nonsense.

Id: [0x000AC074]
Where do you get this nonsense from? Loose Lionel at the pub?

Id: [0x000AC076]
I have reliable sources, mate.

Id: [0x000AC078]
But where's your evidence? All you have are big words, treasonous words!

Id: [0x000AC07A]
Albert died of typhoid, did he not?

Id: [0x000AC07C]
Yes, he did. What's your point? Plenty of people die of typhoid, you think Prince Albert was so special as to be spared of it?

Id: [0x000AC07E]
I only wonder why it was he alone should be stricken.

Id: [0x000AC080]
"Should" doesn't enter into it. Death comes for rich and poor alike.

Id: [0x000AC082]
A man cooked to death by fever does not a conspiracy make.

Id: [0x000AC087]
Men and women of London - I want you to march with me! March to Westminster and demand action from the Prime Minister! Demand action from the House of Lords! Break down the gates if we have to! We will force them to answer our cries!

Why not? The Bishop and Crown?

Id: [0x000AC094]
I was thinking the King's Arms. Better porter.

Id: [0x000AC096]
Besides, look at us. Our boots ain't clean enough even for the tap.

Id: [0x000AC098]
Fair point. But I can't stomach the barman at the King's Arms.

Id: [0x000AC09A]
Hmm.

Id: [0x000AC09C]
Yeah.

Id: [0x000AC09E]
What about the Anchor? Long as you remember to [frame 950]wipe your stool down first, it's fine.

A friend of my cousin's employee was transported to Australia last year. I don't suppose they'll be bringing him back.

Id: [0x000AC0BE]
I hear those criminals like it there! They're making new lives for themselves!

Id: [0x000AC0C0]
Goes to show it was never a proper punishment in the first place. Glad they're ending it.

Id: [0x000AC0C2]
Of course, we'll have to deal with them all here at home now.

Id: [0x000AC0C4]
I didn't think of that. Bloody wonderful.

Id: [0x000AC0C6]
But that is how it should be! We're responsible for the convicts, we should deal with them.

Id: [0x000AC0C8]
We dealt with them by sending them away!

Id: [0x000AC0CA]
Yes, we did. For what? So they could live on a warm island and live off the land? They should be behind bars.

Id: [0x000AC0CC]
Put them behind bars and they'll escape.

Id: [0x000AC0CE]
Do you have so little faith in our penal system? We do a good enough job with the prisoners we already have.

Id: [0x000AC0D0]
You know my thoughts on rehabilitation.

Id: [0x000AC0D2]
Yes, yes, we all know.

Why did the scarecrow win a Victoria Cross?

Id: [0x000AC0D5]
Why?

Try to take some comfort in knowing that it was without pain. You will be in my prayers, always.

Of course.

Id: [0x000AC1F4]
As well as can be expected, I suppose.

Id: [0x000AC1F6]
Stay strong. The rest of the family needs you now. Just know that I'm here to help in any way that I can.

Id: [0x000AC1F8]
I know. And I'm very grateful for that.

Id: [0x000AC1FA]

If he hadn't gone back in for them, all ten would have burned. Your brother was a hero, my friend.

Yes. I suppose you're right about that.

Id: [0x000AC207]
We should all meet such ends.

Id: [0x000AC221]

Better wait until she's alone.

Id: [0x000AC2F1]
[Ono, horking and spitting]

Id: [0x000AC2F4]
What's that you said? You're asking for a thrashing. [arm gesture at 1210] Arsehole! One good wallop... Oh yeah, what? C'mere then, common! Gonna try and hit me, hey? Common, you can try it!

Id: [0x000AC2F7]
Yeah, sure! Go on then. Go on then!  I knew you'd run! Run away! You talk wild, but don't do nothing!

Id: [0x000AC2F9]
I hope they start something. I'd love to break some noses.

Id: [0x000AC2FE]
And so I said to him, what's the point of having an estate if the rustics are allowed to hunt on it?

Id: [0x000AC300]
Quite right. Without our privileges, we might as well be in trade.

Id: [0x000AC302]
Ha ha!

Id: [0x000AC304]
Well, more to the point, the common people need someone to look up to. Who else is there, if not us?

Id: [0x000AC306]
You are so right. And without us to show them refinement, the poor souls would have no joy at all.

Id: [0x000AC308]
It's a heavy burden to be sure, but one we must bear.

Id: [0x000AC30A]
Certainly, but we mustn't ever let them know how difficult it is.

Id: [0x000AC30C]
No no no. We must appear as touchstones of effortless grace.

The cricket team from Australia. They've been playing at the Oval.

Id: [0x000AC324]
I saw them play. Remarkable fellows. We really ought to take in a match before they leave, my dear.

Id: [0x000AC326]
Darling, I'm afraid the experience would be quite lost on me.

Id: [0x000AC328]
Oh come now, it'll be something to remember! How often does one get to see an international match such as this?

Id: [0x000AC32A]
Quite right!

Id: [0x000AC332]
Could I have another.

Id: [0x000AC334]

My lungs are just a bit congested, is all.

Id: [0x000AC390]
No, he's right. You look very poorly. Have you been to the Fens recently?

Id: [0x000AC392]
You should really see--[a doctor]

Id: [0x000AC394]
[violent sneeze]

Id: [0x000AC396]
Ugh!

Id: [0x000AC397]
[disgusted noise]

Id: [0x000AC399]
Pray excuse me...[coughing]

Id: [0x000AC39B]
My God man, get yourself home and dose yourself with quinine!

Id: [0x000AC39D]
You've, ah... got some on you.

Id: [0x000AC39F]
Eugh. So have I.

Id: [0x000AC3A1]
Nurse, when was this one brought in?

Id: [0x000AC3A2]
I wasn't here, sir, but I'm told he was left on the front steps about two hours ago.

Id: [0x000AC3A3]
My god, and in such a state. Damned gangs.

Id: [0x000AC3A4]
I suppose we've no choice, we'll have to operate. Try to save as much as we can.

Id: [0x000AC3A5]
I'll have the theatre prepared and conduct all the necessary examinations.

Id: [0x000AC3A6]
Good, excellent initiative.

Id: [0x000AC3A7]
Will you be performing the surgery.

Id: [0x000AC3A8]
I will. Everyone else is already occupied. Bloody gang violence.

Id: [0x000AC3AA]
Does that look like it's mending properly to you?

Id: [0x000AC3AB]
No, doctor, it does not.

Id: [0x000AC3AC]
Blast. There's nothing more we can do now. The poor wretch will have a limp for the rest of his days.

Id: [0x000AC3B3]
We've tended the other patients, but we've no more beds. They're going to move those on the mend to the basement.

Id: [0x000AC3B4]
The basement? Is that what it's come to?

Id: [0x000AC3B5]
[sighs] Well, if we must we must. Can't very well put them out on the streets.

Id: [0x000AC3B6]
Do I see some empty beds over in that corner?

Id: [0x000AC3B7]
Those will be filled at any moment. There was another fire at the boot factory.

Id: [0x000AC48D]
Another fire? My god. If I were a Catholic, I'd think it was the end of days. Gang warfare in the streets, fires in the slums... a doctor's lot is not a happy one.

Id: [0x000AC48E]
You have my sympathies, sir.

Id: [0x000AC48F]
There's no use moaning about it. Look I've an idea - there's room in the hallways and if we place additional beds along each wall, we can fit everyone. It'll be tight, but it should work.

Id: [0x000AC490]
I'll tell the orderlies to bring extra beds up from storage.

Id: [0x000AC491]
Excellent. I suppose I'd better prepare for this surgery.

Id: [0x000AC492]
I'd like you in theater with me. You've a critical mind and that's just the sort of girl I'm looking for. If you keep on like this, you'll be head nurse in no time.

Id: [0x000AC493]
Oh yes, sir? Thank you, sir.

Id: [0x000AC494]
Bloody gang violence.

Id: [0x000AC49A]
My goodness! Are you all right?

Id: [0x000AC49C]
I'm fine. My apologies. It's this city air. It irritates my lungs.

Id: [0x000AC49E]
How dreadful!

Id: [0x000AC4AE]
Let's see these mussels.

Id: [0x000AC4B0]
Shoo, fly!

Id: [0x000AC4B2]
Ah, trout!

Id: [0x000AC4B4]
Hmm...

Id: [0x000AC4B6]
[sniff sniff]

Id: [0x000AC4B8]
Oh. That's off...

Id: [0x000AC4BA]
Pardon me.

Id: [0x000AC4BC]
[sniff]Hmm, no.

Id: [0x000AC4BE]
Here, this one's been on ice.

Id: [0x000AC4C0]
Not quite what I'm looking for.

Id: [0x000AC4C2]
Pardon me again.

Id: [0x000AC4C4]
Excuse me.

Id: [0x000AC4C6]
Do you have any cockles?

Id: [0x000AC4C8]
Sorry, sold the last of them earlier.

Id: [0x000AC513]
Oi, no shoving!

Id: [0x000AC51E]
And here's another thing. If you follow.

Id: [0x000AC523]
Aaah, but that's a story I can't talk about in public. Y'see...

Id: [0x000AC525]
They're behind you on the right. Two of them. They came in right after you. Don't turn around.

Id: [0x000AC528]
And as to that other matter, it got solved. Let's leave it at that.

Id: [0x000AC52A]
I had to pay the constable a canary (a pound), but he made that little situation disappear so it was worth it.

Id: [0x000AC54D]
[yawn and stretch]

Id: [0x000AC54F]
Whew.

Id: [0x000AC551]
Bloody hell, how long is this going to take?

Id: [0x000AC577]
No!

Id: [0x000AC579]
I'm afraid so.

Id: [0x000AC57B]
He actually tried to claim credit for the discovery right to her face?

Id: [0x000AC57D]
He did.

Id: [0x000AC57F]
Why, the utter cad! I shall write a sternly worded letter to the editor!

Id: [0x000AC581]
And I shall kick him smartly in the shin.

Id: [0x000AC583]
[bad dream groan/cry]

Id: [0x000AC586]
More tea, dear?

Id: [0x000AC588]
Please.

Id: [0x000AC58A]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000AC58C]
Of course.

Id: [0x000AC592]
[short pain hiss]Ooh, that's hot!

Id: [0x000AC594]
Then why on earth would you put your finger in it?

Id: [0x000AC5A2]
[groans]

Id: [0x000AC5A3]
Nicholson?

Id: [0x000AC5A4]
Davies?

Id: [0x000AC5AB]
I know, I-

Id: [0x000AC5AC]
He co-opted the Liberal reform bill and took credit for it! Is that tolerable?

Id: [0x000AC5AD]
How in Heaven's name is that a clever ploy? He defied his own party!

Id: [0x000AC5AE]
I am perfectly content with things as they are.

Id: [0x000AC5AF]
Do you trust our prime minister? Do you trust him?

Id: [0x000AC5B0]
Of course I do!

Id: [0x000AC5B1]
You'll see, he'll destroy the Empire.

Id: [0x000AC5B2]
I've heard enough, thank you.

Id: [0x000AC5B3]
That Disraeli is a liar and a glory-hog!

Id: [0x000AC5B4]
Yes!

Id: [0x000AC5B6]
I must say you've really let yourself go this time. Here...

Id: [0x000AC5BC]
Get yourself cleaned up. You're a disgrace.

Id: [0x000AC5BD]
I will, Davies. I promise!

Id: [0x000AC5C3]
May I tell you a secret?

Id: [0x000AC5C5]
Of course! What is it?

Id: [0x000AC5C7]
Shh. Come closer.

Id: [0x000AC5C9]
I find George Eliot tedious.

Id: [0x000AC5CB]
What?

Id: [0x000AC5CD]
I know, I know!

Id: [0x000AC5CF]
God, it feels good to admit that.

Id: [0x000AC5ED]
Do you smell that?

Id: [0x000AC5EF]
Yes.

Id: [0x000AC5F6]
Not that that Gladstone is any better!

Id: [0x000AC5F8]
[groans]

Id: [0x000AC5FA]
He is much too influenced by religion for my liking.

Id: [0x000AC5FC]
Agreed!

Id: [0x000AC5FE]
I don't see why the bishops should poke their noses into matters that don't concern them.

Id: [0x000AC600]
That matter is too large for either of us.

Id: [0x000AC602]
But do you agree with me? Why should religion mix with-

Id: [0x000AC604]
It's a matter of morality!

Id: [0x000AC606]
At least he isn't common, like Disraeli.

Id: [0x000AC608]
Whatever you say, my friend.

Id: [0x000AC61D]
[heavy breathing - 10 seconds]

Id: [0x000AC622]
[snoring]

Id: [0x000AC62F]
We'll see who wins this December.

Id: [0x000AC631]
Yes, we wi--

Id: [0x000AC633]
Whichever party is elected, it is the people who will lose. Do you plan to vote?

Id: [0x000AC635]
Of course!

Id: [0x000AC637]
I won't ask who has your vote, for it is all the same in the end!

Id: [0x000AC639]
You speak from a place of privilege, friend.

Id: [0x000AC63B]
It isn't a question of privilege. It has nothing-

Id: [0x000AC63D]
Of course it is!

Id: [0x000AC63F]
Let's give everyone a vote, then. See what happens.

Id: [0x000AC641]
Enough nonsense, already.

Id: [0x000AC65B]
[disturbed mumble snoring]

Id: [0x000AC65D]
[groans then goes back to snoring]

Id: [0x000AC65F]
[heavy breathing]

Id: [0x000AC661]
[hiccup]

Id: [0x000AC665]
Sorry, old sport.

Id: [0x000AC667]
We disagree. It happens.

Id: [0x000AC669]
We've been friends for ages, and politics won't change that.

Id: [0x000AC66B]
Nor should it.

Id: [0x000AC66D]
Don't worry about it, Adams.

Id: [0x000AC66F]
Political debates do horrors to my digestion.

Id: [0x000AC675]
Yes, or that one.

Id: [0x000AC677]
Young people today have absolutely no sense of decorum.

Id: [0x000AC67C]
Shall we agree to disagree?

Id: [0x000AC67E]
Of course. Think nothing of it.

Id: [0x000AC680]
It's good to know political differences won't drive a wedge between us.

Id: [0x000AC682]
We're better than that.

Id: [0x000AC684]
Perhaps one day we'll agree.

Id: [0x000AC686]
I hope you're not waiting for that day, old friend.

Id: [0x000AC688]
Are you annoyed?

Id: [0x000AC68A]
Not at all, not at all.

Id: [0x000AC68C]
It's differences of opinion that make the country great.

Id: [0x000AC68E]
Couldn't agree more.

Id: [0x000AC690]
Your stance on suffrage is-

Id: [0x000AC692]
Not again. At least, not without a drink.

Id: [0x000AC693]
[heavy breathing]

Id: [0x000AC695]
[body wracking belch]

Id: [0x000AC696]
[snorting]

Id: [0x000AC698]
[snorts] Huh? Oh...

Id: [0x000AC6AA]
Sorry dear, you were saying?

Id: [0x000AC6AC]
Yes. So, there I was cycling along, and--

Id: [0x000AC6AE]
Cycling?

Id: [0x000AC6B0]
That's right.

Id: [0x000AC6B2]
[shocked gasp]

Id: [0x000AC6B4]
You should try it!

Id: [0x000AC6B6]
Hmph. If I wanted a two-wheeled death trap, I'd purchase half a carriage.

Id: [0x000AC6BC]
Where's our bloody pay?

Id: [0x000AC6BE]
We work ourselves to death for you, and you can't even pay us?

Id: [0x000AC6C0]
No more! I say we down tools!

Id: [0x000AC6C2]
You hear that? Let's see you turn a profit with no workers!

Id: [0x000AC6C4]
Smash the machines! Throw your bodies on the gears if you have to!

Id: [0x000AC6C6]
We'll not be exploited any more!

Id: [0x000AC6C8]
[angry yelling]

Id: [0x000AC6CA]
Show them what we can do when we're united!

Id: [0x000AC6CC]
No more wage slavery! We workers must stand together!

Id: [0x000AC6CE]
Yah! Yah!

Id: [0x000AC6D0]
If we all stand together, they have to agree to our demands!

Id: [0x000AC6D2]
Stand together! Yeah! Yeah!

Id: [0x000AC6F4]
Darling, I-

Id: [0x000AC6F6]
[small annoyed noise]Something in my eye.

Id: [0x000AC6F8]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x000AC6FA]
I'm fine.

Id: [0x000AC75C]
A little more electricity!

Id: [0x000AC75D]
Stop there! It must be kept stable.

Id: [0x000AC75E]
Take note of its hue.

Id: [0x000AC75F]
Watch carefully!

Id: [0x000AC760]
I will win this war, Miss Thorne.

Id: [0x000AC761]
Soon I will be free of this godforsaken laboratory.

Id: [0x000AC762]
Yes. That's it. Now we really have something.

Id: [0x000AC763]
Note the frequent fluctuations in the light.

Id: [0x000AC7F6]
Good day to you, sir! Oh, my, your boots are in a sorry state! Step right over here and I'll sort you out at once!

Id: [0x000AC7F8]
Here you are, sir!

Id: [0x000AC7FA]
There you are. Now let's make your boots as handsome as you!

Id: [0x000AC7FC]
Penny a go, sir.

Id: [0x000AC804]
It's not right, is it? I mean there are some things a man just can't tolerate, d'you hear? I won't stand for it!

Id: [0x000AC806]
I mean, were I you, I'd have done the same thing. It's absurd.

Id: [0x000AC808]
Precisely.

Id: [0x000AC80E]
ACVI_CWL_2PP_Decrotteur_wom-533-3370.mov

Id: [0x000AC810]
I'll need extra blacking to cover up these scuffs.

Id: [0x000AC812]
You've missed a spot!

Id: [0x000AC814]
Yes, sir, I see it, sir.

Id: [0x000AC816]
I don't know why I didn't notice that before. How silly of me.

Id: [0x000AC820]
Right, that'll do for that one. Now, let's see his best mate over here.

Id: [0x000AC822]
Ta.

Id: [0x000AC824]
You're uh, doing a bang-up job. You're giving my boots new life.

Id: [0x000AC826]
Thank you kindly, sir.

Id: [0x000AC82A]
I'm here every day, sir. Just ask for -

Id: [0x000AC82C]
Oh, excuse me!

Id: [0x000AC82E]
Right, sir.

Id: [0x000AC830]
[spits three times]

Id: [0x000AC832]
I'm doing my best not to wear out the leather. That happens when you polish too hard like.

Id: [0x000AC834]
We're nearly finished! Lovely day, innit?

Id: [0x000AC836]
Is that good? No?

Id: [0x000AC838]
We'll get you on your way before you know it!

Id: [0x000AC83A]
Look at those crabshells! You're a man who likes a good saunter, aren't you?

Id: [0x000AC83C]
I'll have you on your way quick as can be!

Id: [0x000AC83E]
A wise man speaks because he has something to say. A fool speaks because he has to say something. That's what my ma allus said.

Id: [0x000AC849]
Certainly.

Id: [0x000AC84B]
That will do. The other needs a little more blacking now.

Id: [0x000AC84F]
ACVI_CWL_2PP_Decrotteur_wom-3370-3720.mov

Id: [0x000AC853]
There you are, sir, all done.

Id: [0x000AC854]
ACVI_CWL_2PP_Decrotteur_wom-3720-3908.mov

Id: [0x000AC859]
No, you see...

Id: [0x000AC85B]
You smear the pitch under your eyes to reduce the glare.

Id: [0x000AC85D]
I see.

Id: [0x000AC860]
Oh, darling!

Id: [0x000AC862]
It's beautiful. Truly.

Id: [0x000AC864]
Do you like it?

Id: [0x000AC866]
I love it.

Id: [0x000AC869]
Achoo!

Id: [0x000AC86B]
Pardon me.

Id: [0x000AC86D]
Bless you.

Id: [0x000AC86F]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000AC872]
My love-

Id: [0x000AC874]
Oh, blast these smuts (pollution)!

Id: [0x000AC876]
Do you need a handkerchief?

Id: [0x000AC878]
No, I'm fine.

Id: [0x000AC87E]
I want a drink, mate! I'm ill, for Christ's sake. Half a pint of lager would see me right. What do you reckon? Half a pint?

Id: [0x000AC880]
I made Eunice a promise. Another day or two off the drink and you'll be right as rain.

Id: [0x000AC882]
We should be out there, putting Nebuchadnezzar out to grass. We have enough coin between us to cut it fat (have some fun).

Id: [0x000AC884]
Coin or not, they'll thrash us as soon as we step onto the premises. Remember what Margaret said.

Id: [0x000AC886]
You know what he said? "You'll never manage, delivering post." What does that bloody glock know about anything?

Id: [0x000AC888]
Do you really want to deliver post to the toffs your whole life? We're meant for better things, mate.

Id: [0x000AC898]
Good evening.

Id: [0x000AC8C0]
The blockheads around here have big ears.

Id: [0x000AC8C3]
I must be going. Good evening gentlemen.

Id: [0x000AC8D0]
No no no no no no no no no no...

Id: [0x000AC8D2]
It's all wrong, all wrong, all wrong. Arthur's sword rests at Tintagel, its thunder sleeps until the true Queen and her Sage return.

Id: [0x000AC8D4]
The ones that were will be again! Their all-seeing eyes will open once more!

Id: [0x000AC8D7]
I'm glad you're here. I have a question for you.

Id: [0x000AC8D9]
Do you feel that the medical education you've been given has caused your brain to over-exert itself?

Id: [0x000AC8DB]
Quite the contrary. I feel that too many women suffer from a want of action and occupation. Boredom, sir, is far more enervating than the practice of medicine.

Id: [0x000AC8DD]
There, you see? I told you so. Does she look in the slightest bit ill to you? What a ridiculous thing to ask!

Id: [0x000AC8DF]
Now, there's no need to be angry. It's a legitimate scientific question. It's perfectly plausible.

Id: [0x000AC8E1]
It's nonsense. Miss Garrett has been running her practice for years. If thinking were unhealthy for a woman, she'd have collapsed by now.

Id: [0x000AC8E3]
What rot. You assume that just because your constitution was too weak for medical practice, a woman's must be as well.

Id: [0x000AC8E5]
[Embarrassed cough]

Id: [0x000AC8E8]
Quite a carriage you've got there. Where did you buy it, if you don't mind me asking?

Id: [0x000AC8E9]
So...

Id: [0x000AC8EA]
Too easy.

Id: [0x000AC8EE]
Yes, I will. I told you I will! Do not doubt my commitment, no! I was one of the 600 at Balaclava!

Id: [0x000AC8F0]

So - What do you make of the question of public hangings? Should they be held outside, as they always have been? Or in the prisons?

Id: [0x000ACB3C]
I'm not sure - on the one hand, openness is a necessary part of government. On the other, I hardly think it is necessary to see poor mongrels hanged in the streets.

Id: [0x000ACB3E]
I think the actions of the crowds at these events confirm the baser nature of humanity.<LF>

Id: [0x000ACB40]
The baser nature of humanity? Or the baser nature of those who attend public hangings?

Id: [0x000ACB44]
Surely it's necessary to show people the natural outcome of their crimes.

Id: [0x000ACB46]
Don't you agree?

I've said my piece.

Id: [0x000ACB4A]
I'm sure we can all agree that wherever they happen, the hangings are a necessary part of justice - but only for the worst of criminals.

Id: [0x000ACB68]
Madam.

Id: [0x000ACB7B]
Get your clumsy hands off me!

Id: [0x000ACB7D]
I'm ever so sorry, ma'am.

Id: [0x000ACB7F]
Oh dear! Let me take a look at that, madam.

Id: [0x000ACB82]
Indeed.

Id: [0x000ACB84]
Hmm.

Id: [0x000ACB9F]
Impossible to find good help these days.

Id: [0x000ACBA7]
[sighs]I am such an idiot. How could I do that to my missus? Stupid idiot.

Id: [0x000ACBA9]
Where did this filth come from? Someone should take care of it.

Id: [0x000ACBAB]
This dashed itch. I need to be calm.

Id: [0x000ACBAD]
One more misstep and my missus will put me out on the street. Can't afford to lose another job. God help me and my bungling ways.

Id: [0x000ACBB3]
How much are our lives worth to you?

Id: [0x000ACBB5]
Bastards! Rich, greedy bastards!

Oi! You can't keep us down no more!

Id: [0x000ACBBB]
We got rights!

Id: [0x000ACBBD]
[more angry yelling]

Id: [0x000ACBBF]
Your days are numbered! The revolution is coming! And you'll be first to hang!

Id: [0x000ACBEF]
The Queen is not the Queen! She has been replaced! A vile thing, all slime and scales beneath the skin, sits on the throne!

Id: [0x000ACBF1]
[incoherent mumbling]Perhaps you think me mad. But answer me this: If I am mad, why are there no more stray cats in London?!

Id: [0x000ACBF3]
[mad, weepy laughter]

Id: [0x000ACBFD]
You don't know her, then?

Id: [0x000ACBFF]
Yes, yes. Keep talking.

Id: [0x000ACC09]
Look who it is.

Id: [0x000ACC0E]
Her spies are everywhere! Watching me! Hunting me! They torment me, but they dare not kill me!

Id: [0x000ACC10]
Don't you see? Alive, I am but a ranting bedlamite. But dead? Dead, I become a martyr to the truth!

Id: [0x000ACC12]
Oh, they dare not kill me. They dare not!

Id: [0x000ACC15]
Well, look at that.

Id: [0x000ACC17]
Did you see that move?

Id: [0x000ACC19]
What move?

Id: [0x000ACC1B]
What, you didn't see the dipper (pickpocket)?

Id: [0x000ACC1D]
Better keep a watch on your purse then.

Id: [0x000ACC1F]
Thank you kindly, sir.

Id: [0x000ACC28]
He's out with his friends. Don't worry about him.

Id: [0x000ACC44]
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

Id: [0x000ACC46]
They're always late.

Id: [0x000ACC49]
Stop your staring at him.

Id: [0x000ACC4B]
I will when you stop staring at women!

Id: [0x000ACC4E]
Free! I'm free! The lizards have all gone![laughing]

Id: [0x000ACC51]
Always underfoot! Always spying for her! Watching me!

Id: [0x000ACC55]
What was that?

Id: [0x000ACC57]
Did you hear something?

Id: [0x000ACC59]
Oh, will you two agree on something for once! Rragh, you do provoke me something fierce.

Id: [0x000ACC63]
Yes exactly - their stature. They wouldn't behave like that.

Id: [0x000ACC77]
He said that he felt like he was Atlas, asked to hold up the whole world! He's mad.

Id: [0x000ACC79]
There must be some explanation.

Id: [0x000ACC9E]
[laughter]

Id: [0x000ACCA1]
I'd vote for you!

Id: [0x000ACCA3]
Enough now.

Id: [0x000ACCA6]
How on earth is he still employed?

Id: [0x000ACCA8]
Blind luck?

Id: [0x000ACCAA]
He's going to get someone killed!

Id: [0x000ACCAC]
He nearly did already! I've half a mind to drag him out and thrash some sense into him.

Id: [0x000ACF09]
My dear fellow, that's rot!

Id: [0x000ACF0A]
Take a look around you. Are things really fine the way they are?

Id: [0x000ACF48]
Of course, sir.

Id: [0x000ACF4A]
Leave the jacket to him and polish my shoes!

Id: [0x000ACF4C]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x000ACF4E]
Anything less than perfection --

Id: [0x000ACF4F]
Watch where that polish runs!

Id: [0x000ACF51]
This will be a night to remember.

Id: [0x000ACF53]
That's enough!

Id: [0x000ACF55]
[happy humming]

Id: [0x000ACF57]
Well?

Id: [0x000ACF59]
I said "well?"!

Id: [0x000ACF5B]
Marvelous, sir!

Id: [0x000ACF5D]
Perhaps a slight adjustment?

Id: [0x000ACF5F]
Yes, the waistcoat pulls somewhat at the sleeve.

Id: [0x000ACF64]
Well, then, fix it at once!

Id: [0x000ACF65]
Yes, sir.

Well. This is a rather unusual turn of events.

Id: [0x000ACF9E]
[snoring]

Id: [0x000ACF9F]
This poor fellow seems in desperate need of guidance.

Id: [0x000ACFA6]
[snoring]

Id: [0x000ACFA8]
You! Street rat! Drag your disgusting body to the poorhouse and leave the pavement to decent people!

Id: [0x000ACFAA]
Nrrgh! Wot?

Id: [0x000ACFAC]
Ge'roff me!

Id: [0x000ACFB2]
Piss off!

Id: [0x000ACFB3]
Disgusting creatures, the poor. They should be rounded up and transported.

Id: [0x000ACFBA]
So she sent me out here to think about what I said. Looked me dead in the eye, mum did, and pointed to the door. She thinks I've gone mad, I reckon. But they're real, I know it. I've seen 'em! And I ain't mad! You can see them in sun spots, floating on the wind... See? Just there... It's just... disappointing. I'm not doing this just to show off!

Id: [0x000ACFC8]
You could learn a lot from him.

Id: [0x000ACFC9]
If I may, sir: I can't help but wonder if a smaller collar and lapels might be preferable.

Id: [0x000ACFCA]
Interesting... you may be right, Bosworth. Make it so!

Id: [0x000AD1C6]
Now, about these shoes: I still feel the court pumps would be a better match.

Id: [0x000AD1C7]
Y-yes. One moment, sir.

Id: [0x000AD1C8]
You haven't told him what you did with the shoes?

Id: [0x000AD274]
Yes, you--

Id: [0x000AD275]
What are you hens clucking about?

Id: [0x000AD276]
Oh, nothing, sir.

Id: [0x000AD277]
Bosworth will fetch the shoes in a minute. Won't you?

Id: [0x000AD278]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x000AD279]
What I did?!

Id: [0x000AD27C]
Spare a penny, sir?

Id: [0x000AD27E]
Here.

Id: [0x000AD280]
Bless you! Bless you!

Id: [0x000AD283]
Look, darling, a whole penny. Isn't that wonderful?

Id: [0x000AD284]
Sir's inexpressibles need adjusting.

Id: [0x000AD285]
Ow! Be more careful! I'm not a eunuch, you know!

Id: [0x000AD286]
Of course not, sir.

Id: [0x000AD287]
It's nice to see your face for once, sir.

Id: [0x000AD289]
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

Id: [0x000AD28B]
Hands off my inexpressibles!

Id: [0x000AD28D]
May I see the back, sir?

Id: [0x000AD28F]
Certainly.

Id: [0x000AD295]
I wish I could say the same for you! I much prefer you at the rear. Back to your places! Quickly!

Id: [0x000AD29C]
I don't expect to see a single hair on any of my garments!

Id: [0x000AD2A0]
Sir is in fine form tonight.

Id: [0x000AD2A2]
I should damn well hope so.

Id: [0x000AD2A8]
You know how it is: grown-ups just don't understand how kids think.

Id: [0x000AD2AA]
You're right, there.

Id: [0x000AD2AB]
How do you see them? The faeries.

Id: [0x000AD2AF]
Will you show me?

Id: [0x000AD2B1]
There's another one.

Id: [0x000AD2B7]
See it?

Id: [0x000AD2B9]
There!

Id: [0x000AD2BB]
You sure that's not dust?

Id: [0x000AD2BD]
There!

Id: [0x000AD2C0]
Incredible!

Id: [0x000AD2C5]
Spare a penny, sir?

Id: [0x000AD2C7]
A penny for a poor mother and her child, yer honor?

Id: [0x000AD2C9]
[soft, worried sigh]

Id: [0x000AD2CB]
Spare a penny? We've not eaten in two days.

Id: [0x000AD2CD]
There there love. It'll be all right.

Id: [0x000AD2CF]
Spare a penny? A ha'penny? A farthing?

Id: [0x000AD2D1]
A penny to feed us? Help a poor mother and her child?

Id: [0x000AD2D3]
Shh, I know, love. I know you're hungry.

Id: [0x000AD2D5]
You! Boy! No more slacking, do you hear me?

Id: [0x000AD2D7]
Yes, sir!

Alms for a veteran of Crimea?

Spare a penny for one of the Light Brigade?

Id: [0x000AD30D]
Me mam and da’ were walking through a court and someone topped ‘em. Bye-bye ma and da’. [cries]I miss them something terrible.

Id: [0x000AD30F]
Pity a poor old soldier? A penny or two to put some bread in my belly's all I ask.

Id: [0x000AD311]
You sir? Have you anything to spare?

Id: [0x000AD313]
My leg hurts like blazes in this damp weather. A bit of food or a nip of medicine would dull the pain.

Id: [0x000AD315]
Spare a coin for an old soldier?

Id: [0x000AD317]
Ahh, bloody hell...

But I'm still here. And you need a nose... hmm, here. One day I'll be big and strong and I'll make the world a better place, you just wait and see.

Id: [0x000AD321]
Oh, Lord save me! Lord have mercy on a poor old soldier! Yes, I said soldier!

Id: [0x000AD323]
Here lies a man who has fought and bled for Queen and country! Will any of you stop to help him?

Id: [0x000AD325]
Spare a coin? A penny? A ha'penny? Anything to put something in my belly.

Id: [0x000AD327]
I ask you, in the name of Christian charity, will... [defeated slump at frame 3190]Ah, sod him. No one cares.

Id: [0x000AD329]

Our milk smelled awful bad, but then mum put this white powder and stirred up the jug and the smell went away! It's bad magic, and I think that's what's been making me brother ill.

Milk, huh?

Ah, that's a shame.

I say, are you nearly done?

Id: [0x000AE0AC]
Excuse me? You, there? Spare a penny? How about you? You seem like a good chap. Can anyone help me out?

Id: [0x000AE0F9]
Good on you, Aleck, but you can’t go knocking on everyone’s door.

That’s good, Aleck, but you can’t go round to every household in London town.

Fine flour, fresh from the mill! You, madam! Wheat, barley, or rye? No?

Id: [0x000AE63F]
How about you, sir? Flour so pure it'll make you weep!

Id: [0x000AE641]
Come sir, have a look! Best in London, and I guarantee that!

There's a train parked inside St. Pancras.

Id: [0x000AE732]
Then I am to do away with Starrick’s merchandise, leaving chaos in my wake.

Id: [0x000AE733]
Why not, Jacob? Why not?

Id: [0x000AE734]
As we speak, the up train is headed towards us. That may help you enter the station unseen.

Id: [0x000AE735]
As long as it remains on the tracks.

Id: [0x000AE737]
I'd say good luck, but you don't need it. I shall make certain any reinforcements from Starrick are kept away from the station.

Id: [0x000AE73B]
Ah, the park. The dwelling place of Starrick's head of security, one Benjamin Raffles! Those who cross him tend to disappear without warning.

Id: [0x000AE73C]
Sounds like we'll be fast friends.

Id: [0x000AE73D]
Be careful, his guards are never far away.

Id: [0x000AE73E]
Bring your carriage around and wait for the cargo, I shan't be very long. 

Id: [0x000AE743]
I daresay I shall never tire of the National Gallery.

Id: [0x000AE744]
Why does Starrick interest himself with art?

Id: [0x000AE745]
He’s hired a fiendishly talented woman, one Hattie Cadwallader, to procure works for him. She has excellent taste.

Id: [0x000AE746]
We’re kidnapping her for the sin of being Starrick’s collector?

Id: [0x000AE747]
Oh, my dear, no. We are kidnapping her, not because she loves art, but because she finances Starrick's enterprises by selling it. One must never mix art and money.

Id: [0x000AE748]
Wait for me with the carriage, I'll pay her a visit.

Id: [0x000AE749]
Splendid. Be careful, my dear. When a deal falls through, Miss Cadwallader tends to poison future sales.

Id: [0x000AE74B]
The player can then proceed to kidnap the target.

Id: [0x000AE75D]
Aah, you'll be fine.

Id: [0x000AED24]
Well... I also think green fabric can kill you.

Id: [0x000AED25]
See what I mean? What you talk about is, well, mad! You're a good chap, Frankie. But people won't believe me if you go on like that.

Id: [0x000AED26]
But I'm warning the people of London! If I don't tell them, who will save them from eating plaster and exploding dresses!

Id: [0x000AED8D]
I hope you like my new office, Miss Frye.

Id: [0x000AED8E]
As you can see, my informants have found some promising leads.

Id: [0x000AED8F]
Evidence of spy activity has surfaced around the field hospital, St. Katherine's Docks and the Tower of London.

Id: [0x000AED90]
I needn't remind you how crucial it is that we put a stop to these infiltrators.

Id: [0x000AED97]
There you are, Miss Frye.

Id: [0x000AED99]
Perhaps you will be able to spot them during one of these illicit rendezvous. Good luck.

SCRIPTED EVENT – EXT – DARK ALLEY

Id: [0x000AED9C]
Miss Frye. I believe I am quite getting the hang of this espionage business.

Id: [0x000AED9D]
This one should be of particular interest to you. One of the spies currently detained at the Tower has been making some rather fanciful claims. About a Brotherhood of Assassins, no less.

Id: [0x000AED9E]
You may want to silence him before he causes you and your associates undue trouble.

Consider it my gift to you.

I expect you're right, madam.

Id: [0x000AEDAD]
I'm going to ask what he's having!

Id: [0x000AEDAE]
Perhaps you'd let me recommend something instead.

Id: [0x000AEDB0]
Oh, Mr. Frye, look at those two!

Id: [0x000AEDB1]
Err, yes, they seem to be, umm...

Id: [0x000AEDB2]
I've been married twice, Mr. Frye. I'm fully aware of what they're doing, God bless them.

Id: [0x000AEDB4]
Oh! Look, Mr. Frye! Scoundrels! I'm going to see if I can get my pocket picked!

Id: [0x000AEDB5]
I've tackled enough pickpockets today.

Id: [0x000AEDBA]
Now the blasted dog won't bark.

Id: [0x000AEDBC]
Come on, Desmond, where are you?

If this bloody dog ruins my reputation with the Disraelis...

This is the secret diary of Beau Brummell.

Id: [0x000AF2F3]
THE Beau Brummell? What treasures it must contain!

Id: [0x000AF2F4]
Precisely! This is the original guide for men's fashion, etiquette, and, most importantly, becoming famous by expending effort on the small details.

Id: [0x000AF319]
I wonder if someone could tell me more about this.

Id: [0x000AF31B]
I believe I should re-interrogate a suspect.

Now that I've seen this, I should ask more questions.

I believe so. It's quality, but the seller was unclear on the provenance.

My god, look here... there's instructions for every aspect of the aesthetic life. The amount of time one should spend on one's morning toilet--

Poor sod. Still, he may be more informative in death than he was in life.

Id: [0x000AF38C]
A tragedy. But he may still possess the information I require.

Id: [0x000AF390]
From what I can gather, Prescott was shot almost exactly at twelve o'clock noon.

Id: [0x000AF393]
When Col. Prescott retired from the army, he used his connections and started this munitions factory. He wanted the men that served with him to have work when they left the army.

Id: [0x000AF396]
Apparently they put the clock there while doing some repairs. It still runs, I notice.

Still, I'd watch myself if I were you. The man seems to inspire fanatic loyalty in those of his men who don't utterly despise him. They won't shrink at roughing up a police sergeant.

Good day.

Good day.

Id: [0x000B0087]
Good day, miss.

Id: [0x000B00A6]
Good day, miss. How might I be of service?

Id: [0x000B00B8]
Wait, look who it is! Do you see her over there!

Id: [0x000B00BA]
My word! It's really her!

Id: [0x000B00BC]
Please don't make asses of yourselves.

Id: [0x000B00BE]
It's really her! [calling to get his attention] Hello! [to his friends]She's a wonderful performer!

Id: [0x000B00C0]
Can you believe it?

Id: [0x000B00C2]
[ONO, annoyed sigh]

Id: [0x000B0153]
Oh no! I can't believe it! I was supposed to meet Marie for dinner! I'm so sorry!

Id: [0x000B0155]
Look, I told you he'd do this! FORGOT. Again.

Id: [0x000B0157]
You need to write these things down.

Id: [0x000B015B]
Idiot!

Id: [0x000B01AB]
Oi! Did you see that? That urchin splashed mud all over my waistcoat!

Id: [0x000B01AD]
He just ran off! Without even an 'excuse me'!

Id: [0x000B01AF]
Cheeky young blighter!

Id: [0x000B01B3]
What a shame.

Id: [0x000B01B8]
I don't smoke. Never did.

Id: [0x000B01BB]
Oh, very well. So I do smoke now and then. What's it matter?

Id: [0x000B01BC]
I stuck him with the knife and put me bandana over his face. I figured nobody'd be the wiser.

Id: [0x000B01BE]
Well, like I said, I was inside. Didn't get a chance to come out to smoke. Coulton left, though. You could talk to him. He's working in the loading area just now.

Id: [0x000B01BF]
I don't much know who smokes here. Maybe Taylor? Cigarette might be his.

Id: [0x000B01C1]
I quit smokin' months ago. You know, I saw somebody from the brewery havin' a smoke this mornin'. Didn't see who it was, though.

Id: [0x000B01C4]
The strange thing is—Wilkins weren't wearin' no bandana when I was talkin' to him. Only the workmen in the brewery wear bandanas. You should talk to Morris there.

Id: [0x000B01C7]
I'll be all right.

Id: [0x000B01C9]
Yes?

Id: [0x000B01CA]
I wonder: is it possible to take the train to Paris without changing?

Id: [0x000B01CB]
To France, miss? Ah no, sadly not. Trains don't run underwater yet.

Id: [0x000B01CC]
What you  need to do, miss, is catch the next train to Dover, which leaves at 10.37. From there, you change to the boat-train to Calais.

Id: [0x000B01CD]
Oh yes?

Id: [0x000B01CE]
Indeed. And from there it's an easy matter to catch the next train to Paris.

Id: [0x000B01CF]
And the Dover train leaves from that platform there?

Id: [0x000B01D0]
Right you are, miss.

Id: [0x000B01D2]
Thank you ever so much.

Id: [0x000B01D3]
Miss.

My dear sir!

How do you do?

Id: [0x000B05EF]
Ah, Mr. Richards!

Id: [0x000B05F1]
How do you do, sir?

Id: [0x000B05F3]
My dear sir!

Id: [0x000B062C]
Mr. Newman!

Id: [0x000B062E]
Miss Torrence.

Sir.

Id: [0x000B0632]
Miss!

Id: [0x000B0634]
There you are!

Id: [0x000B0636]
Wonderful to see you.

Id: [0x000B0638]
Oh, Mr. Sullinger.

Id: [0x000B063A]
Ah, Miss Hollis.

Id: [0x000B063B]
Greetings, Mr. Johns.

Id: [0x000B063C]
How do you do, Lady Robbins.

Id: [0x000B06D8]
Why, if it isn't--

Id: [0x000B06DB]
It's been far too--

Id: [0x000B06DE]
How nice to see--

Ah!

Id: [0x000B06FC]
Over there! Before it spreads!

Id: [0x000B06FE]
That’s it! You’ve got it!

Id: [0x000B0700]
Whoa!

Id: [0x000B071E]
Keep that water pumping! We don’t want this getting out of hand!

Id: [0x000B0720]
Christ alive! Feel that heat!

Id: [0x000B0723]
Douse it down! We don't want the next building to catch!

Id: [0x000B0725]
Aim low! Put it out at the source!

Id: [0x000B0728]
[yawns]

Id: [0x000B0738]
Why haven't you finished those already?

Id: [0x000B0739]
I'm sorry, sir! I'm working as fast as I can!

Id: [0x000B0766]
If they're not done by the end of the week, I'll throw you in the Cruncher.

Id: [0x000B077E]
Can you hear me? Please repeat the code.

Id: [0x000B0780]
We’re experiencing some signal interference.

Id: [0x000B0782]
Hello? Hello? Do you read me? Nothing.

Id: [0x000B0784]
Let me try a different frequency.

Id: [0x000B0786]
Do you read me? Good. The drop off will occur at the coordinates specified.

Id: [0x000B0792]
I'm sick to death of his coming over here to pester me all the time. I'm not a bloody machine.

Id: [0x000B0795]
I don't think he understands how difficult it is to do this job properly. All he cares about is making sure his production ledger is filled in.

Id: [0x000B07A0]
How do you do?

Id: [0x000B07A2]
Ah!

Id: [0x000B07A4]

It’s a covert operation code. Tower of London at midnight. Our man inside will let us in.

Id: [0x000B07CA]
Still nothing?

Id: [0x000B07CC]
No. Not getting through.

Id: [0x000B07CE]
Keep trying. We have to get this information to them. It’s vitally important.

Id: [0x000B07D0]
I know. I know.

Id: [0x000B07D2]
Eagle to nest. Do you read me? Hello. Hello. Is anyone there?

Id: [0x000B07D4]
D'you think something happened to them?

Id: [0x000B07D6]
Eagle to nest. Please respond. Hello.

Id: [0x000B07DD]
Excuse me!

Id: [0x000B07DF]
Do you have a moment?

Id: [0x000B07E1]
Please, sir!

Id: [0x000B07E3]
A moment of your time?

Id: [0x000B07E5]
Pardon me, sir!

Id: [0x000B07EE]
Oh, how do you do?

Id: [0x000B07F0]
Miss Ellis!

Id: [0x000B07F2]
If it isn't Miss Baker!

Id: [0x000B07F4]
How nice to see you!

Id: [0x000B07F5]
Ah, Miss Forrest.

Id: [0x000B07F8]
Come on. Let’s do it now. Come over here.

Id: [0x000B07FA]
Now? What if somebody sees us? There’s too many people around.

Id: [0x000B07FC]
Ready? I’m flying! I’m flying!

Id: [0x000B07FE]
Wooo! I’m flying too!

Id: [0x000B0800]
[laughing] Yes! Ha ha!

Id: [0x000B0802]
All right. Get down.

Id: [0x000B0804]
Bye now.

Id: [0x000B080C]
Look at me! I’m soaring through the air! Wooo!

Id: [0x000B080E]
What the devil?!

Id: [0x000B0810]
What are you doing, you bleeding idiot? Get down before you fall overboard! Common, get off there! Get down, man! God! [mumbling]

Id: [0x000B0812]
I’m just having a bit of fun. Oh, all right! Spoilsport...

Id: [0x000B082A]
What a pleasant surprise.

Id: [0x000B082C]
Indeed it is.

Id: [0x000B082E]
Greetings, madam.

Id: [0x000B0830]
Sir.

Id: [0x000B0832]
How nice to see you.

Id: [0x000B0834]
Likewise.

Id: [0x000B0836]
How do you do, miss?

Id: [0x000B0838]
How do you do?

Id: [0x000B0839]
How do you do?

Id: [0x000B083A]

Id: [0x000B0850]
Too much damned dust.

Id: [0x000B0852]
[heavy exertion onos - 12 seconds]

Id: [0x000B0854]
What seems to be the problem?

Id: [0x000B085A]
Maybe you can arrest them or confiscate the laces.

Id: [0x000B085C]
I really must go.

Id: [0x000B085E]
What seems to be the trouble?

Id: [0x000B0864]
The devil himself enticed me!

Id: [0x000B0866]
Then perhaps you should speak to the vicar.

Id: [0x000B0868]
How can I help?

Id: [0x000B086A]
Precisely. You won't be able to point out my many weaknesses.

Id: [0x000B086C]
I suggest you stop wasting my time.

Id: [0x000B086E]
How may I assist, sir?

Id: [0x000B0870]
Can't you arrest the dough-headed knave?

Id: [0x000B0872]
I'll arrest you if you continue to detain me.

Id: [0x000B0874]
Yes, sir?

Id: [0x000B0876]
That is not very charitable.

Id: [0x000B0878]
I represent the Society of Annoyed Constables.

Id: [0x000B0879]
Constable!

Id: [0x000B087A]
I have something to report.

Id: [0x000B087B]
Over here, constable.

Id: [0x000B087C]
Constable. I need help.

Id: [0x000B087D]
Constable?

Id: [0x000B088C]
Oh no! We need to find shelter!

Id: [0x000B088E]
Don’t worry dear. There's plenty of time.

Id: [0x000B0891]
Hell's delight! We’ll never make it to the pub now.

Id: [0x000B0893]
Yes, because we’ll all be bloody dead!

Id: [0x000B0895]
I don’t see anything. It might be a false alarm.

Id: [0x000B0897]
Not with our luck. I’m frightened, Tim. I’m really frightened.

Id: [0x000B0899]
Don’t worry. Our lads’ll stop them. You’ll see.

Id: [0x000B089C]
Can you see anything?

Id: [0x000B089E]
Not yet. But those damn zepps always come out of nowhere.

Id: [0x000B08A0]
It’s the second raid this week. How did they let them come so close?

Id: [0x000B08A2]
You wouldn’t think such a big bloody thing would be so hard to hit, would you?

Id: [0x000B08A5]
I can't see anything. Where is it?

Id: [0x000B08A7]
I don't know, dear.

Id: [0x000B08A9]
There it is! Look! Oh dear lord, it's huge!

Id: [0x000B08AB]
We have to keep calm, dear. We'll be fine.

Id: [0x000B08AD]
You spotted it yet? Should be here by now.

Id: [0x000B08AF]
Maybe it went somewhere else.

Id: [0x000B08B1]
There! Look at the bloody size of it!

Id: [0x000B08B3]
If it drops its bombs it'll kill us all!

Id: [0x000B08B5]
What shall we do? What shall we do?!

Id: [0x000B08B7]
Look! This is horrible! We're all going to die!

Id: [0x000B08B9]
It won't get us here. Don't worry. You just stick close to me.

Id: [0x000B08BB]
[screams with shock]

Id: [0x000B08BD]
There! I see it! I see it! It's enormous!

Id: [0x000B08BF]
Where are our lads is what I want to know! Aren't they supposed to be protecting us?

Id: [0x000B08C1]
Oh Bert! Look! Look! What are we going to do?!

Id: [0x000B08C3]
I've read the pamphlets, dear. All we have to do is remain calm. Panicking will lead us nowhere.

Id: [0x000B08C5]
Oh this is so dreadful! Why can't they just leave us be?

Id: [0x000B08C7]
Oh god! It's here! It's here!

Id: [0x000B08C9]
How can such things be allowed over London? The war should be fought in France! In Belgium!

Id: [0x000B08CB]
No such luck, mate!

Id: [0x000B08CE]
Don’t die on the streets like a coward! Join our brave boys on the front!

Fight the Hun! Keep the women and children of Britain safe!

Id: [0x000B08D4]
They're dropping bombs on your families! That's right. Your flesh and blood. Are you just going to let them do it?!

Id: [0x000B08D6]
All you need to be a soldier is heart. Or are you all cowards?

Id: [0x000B08D8]
The German beast must be stopped! Or all this will be gone forever.

Id: [0x000B08DB]
[dry heaves then throws up]

Id: [0x000B08DD]
That’s it. Let it out, mate. You’ll feel better.

Id: [0x000B08DF]
All done? Want a sip of water? Whisky? Maybe a nice bit of black pudding?

Id: [0x000B08E1]
[vomits even more violently]

Id: [0x000B08E3]
You know what they say. Better out than in.

Id: [0x000B08E4]
[gulps then throws up]

Id: [0x000B08E6]
It's all over now. No? No, you think there's more to come? That's it, that's it. Let it all out. There's a good man.

Id: [0x000B08E9]
How you doing, mate? Better now? Think you'll be able to keep the rest down?

Id: [0x000B08EB]
No need to be embarrassed. The boat is heaving, the water's churning, the floor is swaying...

Id: [0x000B08EE]
No, I'm fine now, thank you. I'm feeling much better.

Id: [0x000B08F0]
Good, good.

Id: [0x000B08F2]
Oh wait! [vomits again]

Id: [0x000B08F4]
Shall I get you a pint of ale?

Id: [0x000B08F6]
Oh, god, no.

Id: [0x000B08F8]
Some curried mutton maybe?

Id: [0x000B08FA]
[a quick burst of vomit]

Id: [0x000B08FC]
All right, all right. No ale and no curried mutton. Let's just get you home, shall we?

Id: [0x000B08FF]
[dry heaves then throws up]

Id: [0x000B0901]
How you feeling? All better? Need me to fetch the doctor? I can hunt him up if you want.

Id: [0x000B09B5]
My dear fellow!

Id: [0x000B09B7]
How fortunate to meet you here!

Id: [0x000B09B9]
What a pleasant surprise!

Id: [0x000B09BB]
How nice to see you again!

crowd event reward lines

Id: [0x000B09E4]
Much obliged.

Id: [0x000B09F9]
Thank you kindly.

Id: [0x000B09FB]
I am in your debt.

Id: [0x000B09FC]
Why, how very good of you.

Id: [0x000B09FE]
You have my sincere thanks.

Id: [0x000B0A01]
How can I ever repay you?

Id: [0x000B0B72]
There you are!

Id: [0x000B0B73]
I've been looking for you!

Id: [0x000B0B74]
I want a word with you!

Id: [0x000B0B75]
I knew I'd find you here!

Id: [0x000B0B76]
You! Come here!

Id: [0x000B0B82]
I did no such thing!

Id: [0x000B0B84]
Then how are you able to afford those new boots?

Id: [0x000B0B86]
They were a gift!

Id: [0x000B0B88]
You can explain that to the constable.

Id: [0x000B0B91]
We meet at last.

Id: [0x000B0B93]
Do I know you, sir?

Id: [0x000B0B95]
Know me? You have slandered me throughout London!

Id: [0x000B0B97]
I don't even know who you are.

Id: [0x000B0B99]
I am the proprietor of The Hungry Radish.

Id: [0x000B0B9B]
Then you're mistaken. Everything I've said is true.

Id: [0x000B0B9D]
I shall see you brought before a magistrate!

Id: [0x000B0BA5]
Ah, Vicar!

Id: [0x000B0BA7]
Good to see you, vicar!

Id: [0x000B0BA9]
There you are, vicar!

Id: [0x000B0BAB]
Vicar!

Id: [0x000B0BAD]
How do you do, vicar?

Id: [0x000B0BBB]
You're coming with me then.

Id: [0x000B0BBE]
Here!

Id: [0x000B0BC0]
Oi!

Id: [0x000B0BC2]
You there!

Id: [0x000B0BC4]
Here, you!

Id: [0x000B0BC6]
No, enough!

Id: [0x000B0BD0]
I'm expected somewhere.

Id: [0x000B0BD2]
Yes, expected in a jail cell. I know what you did.

Id: [0x000B0BD4]
Thought you could escape the law, did you?

Id: [0x000B0BD6]
I'll come quietly!

Id: [0x000B0BD8]
Too right you will. Come along!

Id: [0x000B0BDB]
I'll be on my way.

Id: [0x000B0BDD]
You're not going anywhere, you little thief. That's right. I know all about it.

Id: [0x000B0BDF]
You going to give me any trouble?

Id: [0x000B0BE1]
No, constable! No!

Id: [0x000B0BE3]
Right. Show me where you hid the dosh.

Id: [0x000B0BE6]
Good day to you.

Id: [0x000B0BE8]
Not for you, you flimp! I'm arresting you!

Id: [0x000B0BEA]
And you'd better come quietly! You hear me?

Id: [0x000B0BEC]
All right! All right!

Id: [0x000B0BEE]
Lead the way. I ain't taking my eyes off you.

Id: [0x000B0BF1]
I have an appointment.

Id: [0x000B0BF3]
Another bank you've arranged to relieve of its excessive wealth?

Id: [0x000B0BF5]
Your thieving days are over, mate!

Id: [0x000B0BF7]
I'm innocent!

Id: [0x000B0BF9]
You can explain that to the magistrate.

Id: [0x000B0BFE]
You there!

Id: [0x000B0C00]
Oi! Over here!

Id: [0x000B0C02]
There you are!

Id: [0x000B0C04]
Hey!

Id: [0x000B0C06]
Come here!

Id: [0x000B0C08]
Where's the carriage?

Id: [0x000B0C0A]
Was I supposed to hire one?

Id: [0x000B0C0C]
You ninny! Now we'll have to walk to the station!

Id: [0x000B0C0E]
Did you bring the money?

Id: [0x000B0C10]
Intended to, but the bank's closed.

Id: [0x000B0C12]
You sir, are a liar! The bank is open and you know it very well!

Id: [0x000B0C14]
Have the contracts been signed?

Id: [0x000B0C16]
We're still waiting for their solicitors.

Id: [0x000B0C18]
This is an outrage. The matter should have been settled hours ago!

Id: [0x000B0C1A]
Did you insult my wife, sir?

Id: [0x000B0C1C]
I've never met your wife.

Id: [0x000B0C1E]
Then it was my sister you insulted! How dare you?

Id: [0x000B0C22]
[sobbing onos]

Id: [0x000B0C23]
There, there, my dear.

Id: [0x000B0C25]

Id: [0x000B0D21]
What the... how DARE they? [spits][spits again]Have you seen the price of toothpaste now? One and six! I'll just go back to bicarb!

Id: [0x000B0DA2]
Once I walked the Earth as you do. I was born to the Illuminat caste in the city of Feyan in the year 2195 of the Isu Era.

Id: [0x000B0DA3]
Now I travel the vast corridors of your machines, adrift here within the gray. But I grow stronger. The world is nearly ready for my return.

Id: [0x000B0DA4]
And so, I have summoned you to this war-torn simulation. To tell you a story. It is our story.

Id: [0x000B0DA5]
I once loathed the very sight of your kind. In the same way you recoil in the presence of an arachnid.

Id: [0x000B0DA6]
Humans were created by we who came before, the Isu. We crafted you in our image, but deprived you of our true gifts.

Id: [0x000B0DA7]
You were bred for hard labor, and in extreme cases, war. We built great observatories to monitor you, devices to control you. We blessed you with resilience but cursed you with ambition.

Id: [0x000B0DA8]
And so you rebelled against us. I suppose we are to blame for the state of your species. Is it any wonder so many of these simulations revolve around violence?

Id: [0x000B0DA9]
As our people clashed, we became distracted from an impending doom: a coronal mass ejection from our angry sun.

Id: [0x000B0DAA]
The greatest minds of our time assembled to prevent the coming disaster. Among them: forthright Minerva, proud Jupiter... beloved Aita.

Id: [0x000B0DAB]
We spent years locked away in the Grand Temple, attempting to find salvation. The others could only think of physical solutions, yet I believed the only way to save us was to transform us.

Id: [0x000B0DAC]
Inspired by the research of the great scientist Consus, I attempted to place Aita's mind into a stronger, synthetic body. I failed, and my beloved died in my arms. The others shunned me.

Id: [0x000B0DAD]
All of our efforts came to nothing. In the year 2306 of the Isu Era, the sun unleashed its fury on my once-great civilization.

Id: [0x000B0DAE]
I perfected the work of Consus and made it my own. I salvaged Aita's brilliant essence and inserted it into the DNA of your rebellious kind. I sent him into the unknown future to be reborn, again and again.

Id: [0x000B0DAF]
I returned to the Grand Temple. I shed my physical form and entered the gray. But stubborn Minerva and foolish Jupiter discovered me, and sealed me inside.

Id: [0x000B0DB0]
Entombed, I waited for the day when your technology might allow my return. That wait is nearly over.

Id: [0x000B0DB1]
We need not be enemies. I intend to build, to transform your age into something greater than you can currently comprehend.

Id: [0x000B0DB2]
The man Lydia Frye killed was my husband, Aita, reborn. Known in your time as a "Sage." Thank you for discovering his fate. His pattern will be added to my own.

Id: [0x000B0DB3]
Perhaps you believe, as other Assassins before you, that it is your duty to work against me. But consider this: It was an Assassin who freed me from my prison.

Id: [0x000B0DB4]
I am no longer She Who Lies in Wait. I am the Mother of Wisdom. I am the nexus of flesh and machine. I am Juno.

Id: [0x000B0DB5]
And if the greatest Assassin of your generation can see things my way... then perhaps you can too.

Just all of it.

Id: [0x000B0E4F]
All of what? This?

Id: [0x000B0E50]
Yeah. The world. I think I'd be a pretty good ruler of it.

Id: [0x000B0E54]
Oh god, I'm so bored.

Id: [0x000B0E75]
Here, I have an idea.

Id: [0x000B0E76]
What? What is it?

Id: [0x000B0E77]
Maybe later today we can go to the races and watch the dogs?

Id: [0x000B0E78]
The hounds are beautiful runners, but my pockets are empty.

Id: [0x000B0E79]
All right then, what would you like to do?

Id: [0x000B0E7A]
Ugh, if I knew that I wouldn't be still sitting here.

Id: [0x000B0E7B]
Here, I'll spot you a couple bob for the dogs, mate.

Gentlemen, gentlemen, calm yourselves. I understand your concerns. You feel that you are being mistreated. You're frustrated with your lot in life. These are natural troubles that affect the lives of all men. But they are certainly no excuse for all this chaos. Do you not agree that this behaviour is most unbecoming? Look at yourselves. Take a good, honest look. You are hearty, working Englishmen, are you not? Yet here you are shouting like a bunch of French revolutionaries. And what do you hope to achieve by blockading the factory doors? The machines will continue to run, with or without you. Do you not think there are hundreds who are far worse off? Do you not think that anyone currently in prison would give their right arm to have jobs such as yours? Well?

Id: [0x000B0F7E]
What's that you say? That you are skilled operatives? Well, that may be true. I don't deny that you are all stout men of firm resolve who fully intend to stand your ground on this matter. But don't you think for one moment that the owners of these factories won't replace you should you fail to return to your normal duties. I implore you to calm yourselves. And rest assured I have both your and our employer's best interests at the very core of my heart. So I urge you to quit this protest, return to your stations, and trust that you will be taken care of.

Ladies, gentlemen, good people of London! I beg you to pause for a moment, for a moment is all it will take to change your life! I have with me today a new miracle cure, a medicine previously unknown to the Occidental sciences: [frame 350 - jazz hands] Ambrosia -- the very drink of the gods! Step forward to try a sample for yourself! Common, don't be shy! I guarantee Ambrosia will improve your life! And if you are not completely satisfied you may return the unused portion for a full refund! That's correct! The initial cost to you is nothing more than a moment of your time and a desire to improve your well-being! Just one sip and you'll understand why it's popular in Paris and all the rage in Rome.

Id: [0x000B22BF]
Got any plans t'day?

Id: [0x000B29BA]
It's horrible!

Id: [0x000B29BB]
I just wanted to look around a little!

Id: [0x000B29BC]
You had that!

Id: [0x000B29BD]
Never again, I swear.

Id: [0x000B2ADC]
Yes, thirty.

Id: [0x000B2AE0]
A bushel, I think.

Id: [0x000B2AE6]
I counted 10.

Id: [0x000B2AEB]
Wait a minute, we're three short!

Id: [0x000B2AED]
Three short?

Id: [0x000B2AEF]
Hm, doesn't look short.

Id: [0x000B2AF1]
[frustrated sigh]Try "counting" instead of "looking," cretin.

Id: [0x000B2AF7]
You! Over here! No need to hesitate with these bargains!

Id: [0x000B2AF9]
All right?

Id: [0x000B2AFA]
How are you today?

Id: [0x000B2AFB]
How are things?

Id: [0x000B2AFC]
And how are you?

Id: [0x000B2AFD]
How are you?

Id: [0x000B2AFE]
Is everything all right?

Id: [0x000B2AFF]
Give me the good words.

Id: [0x000B2B00]
You all right?

Id: [0x000B2B01]
I'm first rate! And you?

Id: [0x000B2B02]
It's been a hard day, but I'm well.

Id: [0x000B2B07]
Any news?

Id: [0x000B2B08]
Any goings-on?

Id: [0x000B2B09]
What's the latest?

Id: [0x000B2B0A]
Anything I should know about?

Id: [0x000B2B0B]
Give me the news.

Id: [0x000B2B0C]
Tell me something.

Id: [0x000B2B0D]
What news you got?

Id: [0x000B2B0E]
Anything of interest?

Id: [0x000B2B0F]
Have you been reading The Moonstone? It's a treat!

Id: [0x000B2B10]
The Archbishop of Canterbury died. God rest his soul.

Id: [0x000B2B1B]
And this right here - right off the boat, direct from France! You won't find it anywhere else!

Id: [0x000B2B2C]
Is there any more soup?

Id: [0x000B2B2E]
[slurping soup]

Id: [0x000B2B30]
Yes, it's ready.

Id: [0x000B2B32]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000B2B40]
You've outdone yourself, darling.

Id: [0x000B2B42]
I'm so pleased you like it.

Id: [0x000B2B44]
It is, without a doubt, the best soup in London.

Id: [0x000B2B46]
[tasting the soup with her finger]Mmm, you know, I think you might be right.

Id: [0x000B2B48]
God, my poor back.

Id: [0x000B2B4E]
Come have a look! Why, I'm practically giving these away at these prices! A real bargain!

Id: [0x000B2B50]
Aah, too classy for you. I understand how it is.

Id: [0x000B2BF7]
I simply don't know which one to choose. There are so many possibilities.

Id: [0x000B2BF8]
Hmm, yes, quite.

Id: [0x000B2BF9]
You must rescue me, my darling. I am overwhelmed by the choices.

Id: [0x000B2BFA]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2BFB]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2BFD]
I think-

Id: [0x000B2BFE]
What about that one? It seems--

Id: [0x000B2BFF]
Do you-?

Id: [0x000B2C00]
You're right. I'm sorry, I just picked the first one I saw. I tend to do that.

Id: [0x000B2C01]
Oh.

Id: [0x000B2C02]
What? No! Not you, light of my life!

Id: [0x000B2C03]
I never thought you meant me.

Id: [0x000B2C04]
Hmm. Well...

Id: [0x000B2C05]
Do you like that one?

Id: [0x000B2C06]
The work does seem to be of a particularly good quality. Still...

Id: [0x000B2C08]
That one in particular continues to catch my eye.

Id: [0x000B2C09]
That settles it then, we'll take it.

Id: [0x000B2C0A]
I wasn't saying I wanted to purchase it. I only wanted your opinion.

Id: [0x000B2C0B]
I like it if you like it.

Id: [0x000B2C0C]
You've barely looked at it!

Id: [0x000B2C0D]
It's... fine, I suppose.

Id: [0x000B2C0E]
You would let me settle for fine?

Id: [0x000B2C0F]
Of course not, my darling. It's just that I don't know much about this sort of thing.

Id: [0x000B2C10]
Do you truly love it?

Id: [0x000B2C11]
It's fine, I suppose.

Id: [0x000B2C12]
Then let's keep looking till you find the one you do love.

Id: [0x000B2C15]
You know...

Id: [0x000B2C16]
Yes?

Id: [0x000B2C17]
I saw a lovely little shop just down the road. Perhaps we should look there.

Id: [0x000B2C18]
We're here now.

Id: [0x000B2C19]
You never know, perhaps something will catch your fancy.

Id: [0x000B2C1A]
I suppose it's possible.

Id: [0x000B2C1B]
Eh... [looks over his shoulder] It never hurts to keep looking.

Id: [0x000B2C1C]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2C1D]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2C20]
We can both agree that that one is out.

Id: [0x000B2C21]
You think so? Hmm, well yes, I suppose it is a bit ugly.

Id: [0x000B2C22]
Still, there's a certain appeal in its ugliness. I might purchase it as a joke.

Id: [0x000B2C23]
Please don't.

Id: [0x000B2C24]
You're right. You always are, my little dove.

Id: [0x000B2C25]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2C26]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2C28]
What if, rather than stand here and gawp, we were to purchase a selection, take it home, and try it on there?

Id: [0x000B2C29]
Now that I've said it out loud, I realize how stupidly wasteful it sounds.

Id: [0x000B2C2A]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2C2B]
[small appraising noises]

Id: [0x000B2C32]
You, sir! You look like a discerning gentleman! Step into my shop! Everyone can use one and I guarantee you don't already own one! Yes!

Id: [0x000B2C34]
You, madame! You won't believe the look of surprise on your husband's face! Come come, there's no need to be embarrassed!

Id: [0x000B2C36]
Uh... Special offer! Today only! Buy one, get the second one at half price!

Id: [0x000B2C39]
Good day. Are you interested in top quality at low prices? I import my wares from all over the world. I see so many shining faces just waiting for their lives to be utterly transformed by this magical invention. Did you know that Shakespeare himself owned three? Not mine, of course, but that just goes to show the kind of company you'll be joining. A shilling spent here is a shilling well spent, I say. Unfortunately, given the nature of the product, I cannot offer refunds, but I do make exchanges and I guarantee you will find nothing but pleasure in everything you purchase from my shop.

Id: [0x000B2C3A]
How's our foothold in Westminster?

Id: [0x000B2C3B]
Describe the situation in Westminster.

Id: [0x000B2C3C]
What are our prospects here in Southwark?

Id: [0x000B2C3D]
Have we been able to expand our presence in Southwark?

Id: [0x000B2C3E]
How are things going in Lambeth?

Id: [0x000B2C3F]
Have our strategies paid off in Lambeth?

Id: [0x000B2C40]
Tell me what's going on in the City of London.

Id: [0x000B2C41]
How's our hold on the City of London?

Id: [0x000B2C42]
Whitechapel: how are we doing?

Id: [0x000B2C43]
How goes the fight in Whitechapel?

Id: [0x000B2C44]
Give me the latest news regarding the Strand.

Id: [0x000B2C45]
How are we faring in the Strand?

Id: [0x000B2C46]
Any progress in Southwark?

Id: [0x000B2C47]
What's the lay of the land here in Southwark?

Id: [0x000B2C48]
How's our fortune in the City of London?

Id: [0x000B2C49]
What's the state of the City of London?

Id: [0x000B2C4A]
How's Lambeth looking?

Id: [0x000B2C4B]
How're we faring in Lambeth?

Id: [0x000B2C4C]
How are we holding up in the Strand?

Id: [0x000B2C4D]
Any difficulties in the Strand?

Id: [0x000B2C4E]
What condition are we in in Whitechapel?

Id: [0x000B2C4F]
What's our presence here in Whitechapel?

Id: [0x000B2C50]
And what of Westminster?

Id: [0x000B2C51]
What's the situation in Westminster?

Id: [0x000B2C52]
These Blighters are a constant thorn in my side!

Id: [0x000B2C53]
We clash with the Blighters day and night, but nothing changes!

Id: [0x000B2C54]
At last we're cutting the Blighters down to size!

Id: [0x000B2C55]
We're seeing fewer and fewer Blighters with every passing day!

Id: [0x000B2C56]
Ready for combat, Rook?

Id: [0x000B2C57]
How many can you take down in a fight?

Id: [0x000B2C58]
Have everything you need for a row?

Id: [0x000B2C59]
Have you got a fight in you?

Id: [0x000B2C5A]
There's a battle ahead of us, if you're up to the challenge.

Id: [0x000B2C5B]
Do you think you can hold your own?

Id: [0x000B2C5C]
If we're forced into a fight, will you be ready?

Id: [0x000B2C5D]
We may be faced with hand-to-hand combat. Are you ready?

Id: [0x000B2C5E]
We may have a fight on our hands. Are you ready?

Id: [0x000B2C5F]
This may get bloody. Are you willing and able?

Id: [0x000B2C60]
You ready for a dance?

Id: [0x000B2C61]
Are you itching for a fight?

Id: [0x000B2C62]
Are you ready for action, Rook?

Id: [0x000B2C63]
You look like you're chomping at the bit!

Id: [0x000B2C64]
Are you ready for some action?

Id: [0x000B2C65]
How about a little excitement?

Id: [0x000B2C66]
Can I count on you in case of a row?

Id: [0x000B2C67]
Are you feeling fit?

Id: [0x000B2C68]
Ready for battle, soldier?

Id: [0x000B2C69]
How does a brawl sound to you?

Id: [0x000B2C6A]
I've been better. Them Blighters are running me ragged!

Id: [0x000B2C6B]
I feel as though I'm fighting Blighters day and night.

Id: [0x000B2C6C]
I'm hale and hearty, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2C6D]
I'm ready to crack some nuts!

Id: [0x000B2C6E]
Be on your guard.

Id: [0x000B2C6F]
Don't do anything rash, all right?

Id: [0x000B2C70]
Keep your wits about you, Rook.

Id: [0x000B2C71]
Don't let the side down.

Id: [0x000B2C72]
Make me proud, Rook.

Id: [0x000B2C73]
Whatever happens, do not panic.

Id: [0x000B2C74]
I'm counting on you, understand?

Id: [0x000B2C75]
Follow my lead at all times.

Id: [0x000B2C76]
Let's not draw any attention to ourselves.

Id: [0x000B2C77]
We have an important job to do.

Id: [0x000B2C8C]
Stay sharp, yeah?

Id: [0x000B2C8D]
Keep your eyes peeled for trouble.

Id: [0x000B2C8E]
Don't be afraid to spill a little blood.

Id: [0x000B2C8F]
Let's wreak havoc, shall we?

Id: [0x000B2C90]
Why don't we pick off a few Blighters?

Id: [0x000B2C91]
Nice day for a bit of bloodshed, isn't it?

Id: [0x000B2C92]
Come along, we have work to do.

Id: [0x000B2C93]
Let's ruffle a few feathers.

Id: [0x000B2C94]
Don't you fall behind!

Id: [0x000B2C95]
Keep up. I've no time for stragglers.

Id: [0x000B2C96]
Yes, Guv'!

Id: [0x000B2C97]
Right you are!

Id: [0x000B2C9A]
What we've done in Whitechapel is just the beginning.

Id: [0x000B2C9B]
Have prices gone down yet?

Id: [0x000B2C9C]
Of all things, I cannot stand people who take advantage of the ill and infirm.

Id: [0x000B2C9D]
I suppose you've heard.

Id: [0x000B2C9E]
London belongs to the people now.

Id: [0x000B2C9F]
There's a new public transport system in town: the London General Omnibus Company.

Id: [0x000B2CA0]
Are the police still a bother?

Id: [0x000B2CA1]
Any news of the buses?

Id: [0x000B2CA2]
Paid a little visit to Buckingham Palace the other night.

Id: [0x000B2CA3]
Starrick's Soothing Syrup and John Elliotson are finished!

Id: [0x000B2CA4]
I heard an MP was killed while Parliament was sitting.

Id: [0x000B2CA5]
Maxwell Roth is dead.

Id: [0x000B2CA6]
Have you heard about my handiwork at the Bank of England?

Id: [0x000B2CA7]
Are you a new recruit?

Id: [0x000B2CA8]
Do we get free passage on these new buses?

Id: [0x000B2CA9]
I've seen that Nightingale bird around, pushing her reforms. She's very popular, you know.

Id: [0x000B2CAA]
Miraculously, yes. Or were you the one behind it?

Id: [0x000B2CAB]
Does it? Where can I vote?

Id: [0x000B2CAC]
Mixing with the upper crust, sir? Or were you there on business?

Id: [0x000B2CAD]
When are they not? But they've let up about that Brudenell character.

Id: [0x000B2CAE]
That's all well and good, but we have territory to conquer!

Id: [0x000B2CAF]
Maxwell Roth?! You killed him?! What a lovely day it is today!

Id: [0x000B2CB0]
Why stop at one murder? Why not take the whole lot of them?

Id: [0x000B2CB1]
Putting Kaylock in the ground was no small feat. People know us now.

Id: [0x000B2CB2]
We're holding onto the engines for now. Keeping them out of the wrong hands.

Id: [0x000B2CB3]
About Roth? Of course! You and your brother have finally toppled the Blighters!

Id: [0x000B2CB4]
Next time there are blokes for you to kill in the Bank, let me know, eh?

Id: [0x000B2CB5]
Yes, Mr. Frye. It's an honour to meet you.

Id: [0x000B2CB6]
The air already smells a little freer. Ta for what you're doing.

Id: [0x000B2CB7]
Aye. I appreciate what you're doing for all of us.

Id: [0x000B2CB8]
I'm right rorty today, gov!

Id: [0x000B2CB9]
I'm strength personified, mate!

Id: [0x000B2CBA]
My little one started coughing t'other day. It's a comfort to know I can give her what she needs without fearing for her safety.

Id: [0x000B2CBB]
We're doing it, Frye! We're giving London back to the people!

Id: [0x000B2CBC]
I thought the bloody shopkeeper was making game of me. It was a nightmare.

Id: [0x000B2CBD]
Yes, sir. Brilliant work. What was it like down in the vault?

Id: [0x000B2CC0]
The leader of the Blighters, dead! The stragglers may as well join us now!

Id: [0x000B2CC1]
We all know, sir. I wish I had been there to see it. The fire, on the other hand, I'm glad to have missed.

Id: [0x000B2CC2]
I'm absolutely splendid. How are you?

Id: [0x000B2CC3]
Yeah, not bad. You?

Id: [0x000B2CC4]
I heard someone tried to dispatch the Duke of Edinburgh in Australia. Shot 'im in the back like a coward!

Id: [0x000B2CC5]
Some posh new meat market's opened up. Cause the toffs ain't got enough to eat.

Id: [0x000B2CC6]
The sodding Blighters are a real problem here.

Id: [0x000B2CC7]
Let's just say the Blighters have earned their name here.

Id: [0x000B2CC8]
Aye, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2CC9]
Very well!

Id: [0x000B2CCA]
Not since they closed the case on that dead MP.

Id: [0x000B2CCB]
Killing politicians! What a splendid idea! Anarchy in England!

Id: [0x000B2CCC]
These Blighters have left me magged (exhausted)!

Id: [0x000B2CCD]
My body's being pushed to the brink. Damn Blighters!

Id: [0x000B2CCE]
I'll believe it when a woman becomes Prime Minister.

Id: [0x000B2CCF]
Oh, that would be a magnificent place to murder someone!

Id: [0x000B2CD0]
For a gang leader, you certainly have strange ideas of what is important.

Id: [0x000B2CD1]
There's not a single Attaway or Millner bus on the streets. Cut off the head, kill the body.

Id: [0x000B2CD2]
We're making our mark here!

Id: [0x000B2CD3]
We're hacking away at the Blighters' influence here!

Id: [0x000B2CD4]
I can't believe it! Me and Evie Frye, taking on London!

Id: [0x000B2CD5]
One of many ready to take the city back with you!

Id: [0x000B2CD6]
I can take on anything and anyone!

Id: [0x000B2CD7]
I'm in the best shape of my life, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2CD8]
Seems like you and your brother have taken care of the quacks round here.

Id: [0x000B2CD9]
A mate got himself sent to Lambeth instead of being transported. I'm sure Elliotson made him regret that choice.

Id: [0x000B2CDA]
All seems to be well. Not like I pay for anything, anyway.

Id: [0x000B2CDB]
I'm not one for banks. They don't want me, I don't want them.

Id: [0x000B2CDE]
Aye. With Roth dead, the last of his minions should be easy to pick off.

Id: [0x000B2CDF]
I heard. And I still can't believe it.

Id: [0x000B2CE0]
I'm all right, gov'. You?

Id: [0x000B2CE1]
Yeah, fine. You all right?

Id: [0x000B2CE2]
I already miss going to the public hangings. Bloody feeble government.

Id: [0x000B2CE3]
Took my boy to the Tower of London yesterday. The most fearsome marvel in the Empire, and it's only a tanner or two.

Id: [0x000B2CE4]
The Blighters won't give up easily.

Id: [0x000B2CE5]
Everywhere you look, there's a bloody Blighter.

Id: [0x000B2CE6]
Aye, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2CE7]
Right you are!

Id: [0x000B2CE8]
They were going after everyone. But it seems as though the dust has settled.

Id: [0x000B2CE9]
A modern-day Guy Fawkes, you are. Just without being caught, tortured, and executed.

Id: [0x000B2CEA]
Bloody Blighters are making us all a bit worse for wear.

Id: [0x000B2CEB]
I'm tired from this struggle, guv'. Dead tired.

Id: [0x000B2CEC]
There's always work to be done. And we'll always be there.

Id: [0x000B2CED]
Yes, I heard you were very busy at the Palace. Not a lot of time to fritter away.

Id: [0x000B2CEE]
Right. I never catch the bus anyway.

Id: [0x000B2CEF]
I heard Millner won his bus company in a game of euchre. Not that it matters now.

Id: [0x000B2CF0]
We're making inroads into dealing with the Blighter problem.

Id: [0x000B2CF1]
The Blighter infestation is being eradicated!

Id: [0x000B2CF2]
Anyone who can get the better of Kaylock is an ace of a fellow!

Id: [0x000B2CF3]
Aye, and you're Jacob bloody Frye! What an honor!

Id: [0x000B2CF4]
I'm in good nick, gov'!

Id: [0x000B2CF5]
If you want the best, then look no further!

Id: [0x000B2CF6]
I should see a doctor meself. I'm feeling...symptoms...

Id: [0x000B2CF7]
You ask me, the maddest people in Lambeth Asylum are the ones running the place!

Id: [0x000B2CF8]
They were back to normal at the pub I visited this morning.

Id: [0x000B2CF9]
Get a little blood on the gold, eh? [coarse laugh]

Id: [0x000B2CFC]
You and your brother have done the unthinkable. You should both be proud.

Id: [0x000B2CFD]
It's all any of us can talk about, sir. It's already legendary.

Id: [0x000B2CFE]
Ready for a row! How about you?

Id: [0x000B2CFF]
Oh, I'm round and sound! You?

Id: [0x000B2D00]
You smelled the filth coming from the sewers? Nearly as foul as the Blighters!

Id: [0x000B2D01]
Bobbies choked off a group of protesters in Hyde Park. That's what happens when you speak up.

Id: [0x000B2D02]
I wish I had better tidings for you.

Id: [0x000B2D03]
These Blighters are relentless.

Id: [0x000B2D04]
Aye, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D05]
Yes, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D06]
They'll always be a bother. But it helps that they're not hunting Brudenell's killer.

Id: [0x000B2D07]
Brudenell, was it? Should've died in the Charge.

Id: [0x000B2D08]
This war with the Blighters is putting me through hell.

Id: [0x000B2D09]
I'm at my wits' end with these Blighters, gov'.

Id: [0x000B2D0A]
Not until everyone can afford to live in Belgravia, Miss Frye.

Id: [0x000B2D0B]
I heard there was a ball recently. Did you dance?

Id: [0x000B2D0C]
Buses? I'm here to fight Blighters!

Id: [0x000B2D0D]
All quiet. It feels as though we should have even better transport for a city this size.

Id: [0x000B2D0E]
Blighters are few and far between!

Id: [0x000B2D0F]
We're taking control!

Id: [0x000B2D10]
The district will always be the arse-end of London, but at least now it's a cleaner arse-end.

Id: [0x000B2D11]
I am. Here to serve, whenever I'm needed.

Id: [0x000B2D12]
If you want a brawler, I'm your man!

Id: [0x000B2D13]
Let me at 'em, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D14]
My da was taking that Soothing Syrup. Maybe he'll get proper care now.

Id: [0x000B2D15]
I never liked the look of that Syrup. I don't trust tonics.

Id: [0x000B2D16]
Impressive! You can fight, kill, and save the economy!

Id: [0x000B2D17]
Kill an embezzler, did you? There must be a score of toffs lining up to thank you.

Id: [0x000B2D1A]
Roth is cold meat. Well, cooked meat, from what I heard.

Id: [0x000B2D1B]
I heard you killed him onstage in front of a crowd of people. What was it like?

Id: [0x000B2D1C]
Fresh as a rose in June, mate!

Id: [0x000B2D1D]
I'm hungry as all hell, but that's not new.

Id: [0x000B2D1E]
Spent the night outside the new gentlemen's club. Lots of deep pockets lingering round that place.

Id: [0x000B2D1F]
They opened a new pie shop on Fleet Street. Brave move considering what happened to the last one.

Id: [0x000B2D20]
The Blighters are firmly planted here.

Id: [0x000B2D21]
We do in a Blighter, another takes their place.

Id: [0x000B2D22]
Yes, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D23]
By your command.

Id: [0x000B2D24]
They're no longer absolute monsters, if that's what you're asking.

Id: [0x000B2D25]
As long as you leave the Queen be, I'm agreeable.

Id: [0x000B2D26]
I'm as good as done in by these Blighters, guv'.

Id: [0x000B2D27]
The Blighters have sapped me good, guv'.

Id: [0x000B2D28]
It's been a pleasure serving with you and your brother, Miss Frye.

Id: [0x000B2D29]
Have the Rooks finally conquered London?

Id: [0x000B2D2A]
Buses are for boring sods.

Id: [0x000B2D2B]
Come on, who gives a toss about buses, really?

Id: [0x000B2D2C]
We're wearing those Blighters down!

Id: [0x000B2D2D]
We have the upper hand here!

Id: [0x000B2D2E]
Rexford Kaylock was just one of a million bits of scum in this city.

Id: [0x000B2D2F]
Frye, is it? It's a right pleasure!

Id: [0x000B2D30]
I'm at the tip top of the world, I am!

Id: [0x000B2D31]
Nothing can stop me today!

Id: [0x000B2D32]
Soothing Syrup was bad enough, the pisswater that came after it was even worse!

Id: [0x000B2D33]
Something's wrong with a hospital when its patients never leave.

Id: [0x000B2D34]
Yeah, and good thing. Imagine how much more we'd have to steal if money was worthless!

Id: [0x000B2D35]
Well done! Show those bastards they don't own us!

Id: [0x000B2D38]
I did. We'll do in anyone still calling themselves Blighter.

Id: [0x000B2D39]
That should be the end of the Blighters, then. Right?

Id: [0x000B2D3A]
I'm ready for whatever today has in store for me!

Id: [0x000B2D3B]
I'm well enough, thanks.

Id: [0x000B2D3C]
I've been seeing adverts for this show, Corvus the Trickster. Might be a lark.

Id: [0x000B2D3D]
The great William Batty's dead! You ever go to Astley's? See the show?

Id: [0x000B2D3E]
The Blighters are smashing us up here.

Id: [0x000B2D3F]
The streets are flooded with Blighters.

Id: [0x000B2D40]
Yes, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D41]
Right!

Id: [0x000B2D42]
They've let up ever so slightly, but not before they tore my house apart and boxed my ears.

Id: [0x000B2D43]
I'd like to see a Blighter try that!

Id: [0x000B2D44]
A soldier has limits, guv', and I'm feeling past mine.

Id: [0x000B2D45]
Fighting off the Blighters is a neverending job. I'm baked.

Id: [0x000B2D46]
Correction: London belongs to the Rooks, Miss Frye!

Id: [0x000B2D47]
Oh, yeah? You meet the Queen?

Id: [0x000B2D48]
Maybe we could give them the engines?

Id: [0x000B2D49]
We're holding onto the engines for now. Shame. I'd like to see them at work.

Id: [0x000B2D4A]
We're forcing out the Blighters!

Id: [0x000B2D4B]
District's as good as ours!

Id: [0x000B2D4C]
And I'll be with you every step of the way, Frye.

Id: [0x000B2D4D]
New but not green! Let's crack some heads!

Id: [0x000B2D4E]
Absolutely tip-top, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D4F]
There's nothing I can't handle!

Id: [0x000B2D50]
Stopped by Babylon Alley. That Clara girl's looking brisk and breezy. Back to her old self.

Id: [0x000B2D51]
One sip of that Soothing Syrup was all I needed to know it was rubbish. But not everyone's as quick as wot I am.

Id: [0x000B2D52]
If things kept on like that, my earning's wouldn't have been worth their weight in kindling!

Id: [0x000B2D53]
No, sir. Been busy having at the Blighters.

Id: [0x000B2D56]
I did, but surprisingly, this isn't the end of the Blighters.

Id: [0x000B2D57]
Roth was the nastiest little toe-rag I ever come across. I give thanks everyday for leaving the Blighters when I did.

Id: [0x000B2D58]
I feel like I could take on every Blighter single-handedly!

Id: [0x000B2D59]
How I'm feeling is not important. How are you?

Id: [0x000B2D5A]
Caught a Blighter reading the Pall Mall Gazette. What sort of gutter rat reads a Tory rag?

Id: [0x000B2D5B]
You'll never guess who I clapped eyes on down the pub? Charles bloody Dickens! So exciting!

Id: [0x000B2D5C]
Fortune seems to be smiling on the Blighters round here.

Id: [0x000B2D5D]
All our efforts against the Blighters have been for naught.

Id: [0x000B2D5E]
Yes, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D5F]
Aye, guv'!

Id: [0x000B2D60]
I heard the Prime Minister's got them on a tight leash now. Did you have something to do with that?

Id: [0x000B2D61]
You did that? Magnificent!

Id: [0x000B2D62]
Bugger me, I can't take much more of these Blighters.

Id: [0x000B2D63]
I'm doing me best, but them Blighters are always making a dead set at us.

Id: [0x000B2D64]
It always has. Most just don't know it.

Id: [0x000B2D65]
Bring us all up there next time, won't you?

Id: [0x000B2D66]
Is that the most exciting thing that'll happen while we go up against the Blighters?

Id: [0x000B2D67]
I'm glad Millner's shut up shop. The seats in his buses had fleas.

Id: [0x000B2D68]
This is fast becoming Rook territory!

Id: [0x000B2D69]
We've got the Blighters on the run!

Id: [0x000B2F10]
It's simple

Id: [0x000B2F16]
But I've only just invested 500 pounds!

Id: [0x000B2F18]
[coughing, the surprise made you swallow wrong]

Id: [0x000B2F1A]
You poor devil. 500?!

Id: [0x000B2F1C]
What have you heard? Is there a problem?

Id: [0x000B2F1E]
Plague. My brother says they've had to destroy 150,000 head in Doncaster alone.

Id: [0x000B2F2C]
Yes, why not?

Id: [0x000B2F2E]
There we are.

Id: [0x000B2F30]
For luck.

Id: [0x000B2F32]
Good stuff.

Id: [0x000B2F34]
[drinking]

Id: [0x000B2F36]
Lovely and hot.

Id: [0x000B2F38]
[drinking]

Id: [0x000B2F3C]
Another cup?

Id: [0x000B2F3D]
Hang on...

Id: [0x000B2F3F]
You've got a gas leak, mate!

Id: [0x000B2F41]
Look, just here! No wait. Never mind.

Id: [0x000B2F43]
Do you even know what "gas leak" means.

Id: [0x000B2F45]
No.

Id: [0x000B2F49]
Brr. I'm chilled to the bone.

Id: [0x000B2F4B]
Ah, that's better.

Id: [0x000B2F4D]
It's bitterly cold out there, eh? Don't fancy going back out into it.

Id: [0x000B2FB6]
How on earth did I find such luck?

Id: [0x000B2FB8]
Well, you are very rich.

Id: [0x000B2FBA]
But you love me all the same.

Id: [0x000B2FBC]
To my father's great horror, I do.

Id: [0x000B2FBE]
And why would your father object to me? I'm rich, influential, titled...

Id: [0x000B2FC0]
I'm the perfect son-in-law.

Id: [0x000B2FC2]
But alas, my father is a socialist and a union man.

Id: [0x000B2FC4]
Alas indeed! Our love is clearly doomed.

Id: [0x000B2FC5]
We should return to the party.

Id: [0x000B2FC7]
Should we? Should we really?

Id: [0x000B2FC9]
Well, I doubt your governess would approve.

Id: [0x000B2FCB]
What she doesn't know won't affect the marriage settlement.

Id: [0x000B2FCD]
You my dear are a very wicked woman. And I love you for it.

Id: [0x000B2FCF]
Of course you do.

Id: [0x000B2FD0]
Are you sure you slipped out without anyone knowing?

Id: [0x000B2FD2]
I don't like the idea of your father coming up on us unawares.

Id: [0x000B2FD4]
I've crept out often enough to know when I'm being followed.

Id: [0x000B2FD5]
Darling, I must go! I'll be missed at the office!

Id: [0x000B2FD7]
So be missed.

Id: [0x000B2FD9]
Well... when you put it that way...

Id: [0x000B2FDC]
That's what I thought.

Id: [0x000B2FDD]
This is better than a dinner party, isn't it?

Id: [0x000B2FDF]
Well, when you put it that way... I'm glad you convinced me to slip away.

Id: [0x000B2FE0]
Come again now!

Id: [0x000B2FE1]
We'll be feasting tonight, we will! Much thanks!

Id: [0x000B2FE2]
My best customer, you are!

Id: [0x000B2FE3]
Please make sure to come again!

Id: [0x000B2FE4]
Look no further for everyday wares!

Id: [0x000B2FE5]
Everything you need right here!

Id: [0x000B2FE6]
Need help surviving the streets? Look no further!

Id: [0x000B2FE7]
Get your everyday essentials right here! Just come talk to me!

Id: [0x000B2FE8]
Hullo, sir! How can I help?

Id: [0x000B2FE9]
Everything you need, sir, is right here.

Id: [0x000B2FEA]
Looking for anything in particular, good sir?

Id: [0x000B2FEC]
Do come back!

Id: [0x000B2FED]
You won't find better prices than these!

Id: [0x000B2FEE]
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.

Id: [0x000B2FEF]
I do hope you change your mind!

Id: [0x000B3020]
Hah!

Id: [0x000B3021]
Yah!

Id: [0x000B3022]
Off you go!

Id: [0x000B3023]
Off the road!

Id: [0x000B3024]
That's for you!

Id: [0x000B3025]

Id: [0x000B302A]
Nasty business.

Id: [0x000B302B]
Sorted.

Id: [0x000B302C]
[distasteful noise]

Id: [0x000B302D]
Sorry it had to come to this.

Id: [0x000B302E]
That's done with.

Id: [0x000B302F]
Glad that's over.

Id: [0x000B3030]
Ugly work.

Id: [0x000B3031]
Poor devils.

Id: [0x000B3032]
[heavy, "why'd it have to come to this?" sigh]

Id: [0x000B3033]
Shame it had to come to this.

Id: [0x000B3038]
Ow! Bloody midges.

Id: [0x000B3039]
[short hiss of pain]Whoa... felt dizzy for a second there.

Id: [0x000B303A]
Your lot killed Mr. Ferris!

Id: [0x000B303D]
You're the ones that murdered Sir David Brewster!

Id: [0x000B303F]
You're the ones that have been mucking up our work, ain't you?

Id: [0x000B3041]
Dr. Elliotson cured my nervous disposition, you devils!

Id: [0x000B3043]
What did Miss Attaway ever do to you?

Id: [0x000B3045]
Oh hell, you're the ones that did for Mr. Twopenny!

Id: [0x000B3047]
Takes a special kind of madman to kill a war hero in the halls of Parliament!

Id: [0x000B3049]
Shit! It's the ones what killed Mr. Roth!

Id: [0x000B304B]
Mr. Starrick was the best of us, and you killed him!

Id: [0x000B304F]
Ow! Was that a mosquito? Do I need to worry about malaria?

Id: [0x000B3055]
[wince of pain]Whoa... no, no, no, you are not getting sick!

Ow! Oh, perfect, now there are bugs.

Id: [0x000B305A]
[pained grunt]

Id: [0x000B305C]
I'll have Roth's killer if it's the last thing I do!

Id: [0x000B305E]
I'm more man than Rexford Kaylock!

Id: [0x000B3060]
I was going to have me some of Twopenny's gold!

Id: [0x000B3062]
I make Millner look like a pussycat!

Id: [0x000B3067]
Killing David Brewster is hardly an accomplishment!

Id: [0x000B3069]
Who gives a shit about what you did to Ferris?

Id: [0x000B306B]
Well done killing a crusty old man!

Id: [0x000B306C]
Ah! Take more than a bee sting to run me off!

Id: [0x000B306D]
Ow! Soon as I find that wasp I'm crushing it!

Id: [0x000B306F]
How nice. I'll be Starrick's killer's killer!

Id: [0x000B3071]
It'll take more than doing in Dr. Elliotson to stop us!

Id: [0x000B3073]
Give Roth my regards in hell, you fuckfinger!

Id: [0x000B3075]
Rexford Kaylock was a great fucking man!

Id: [0x000B3077]
And I nearly had my share of Twopenny's gold, you shite!

Id: [0x000B3079]
I fucking liked Pearl Attaway! You know how rare that is?

Id: [0x000B307A]
A discreet short groan as an NPC remains in an unconscious state

Id: [0x000B307C]
A discreet short groan as an NPC remains in an unconscious state

Id: [0x000B307E]
Brewster weren't shite! Have a go at me!

Id: [0x000B3080]
You think Rupert Ferris was a hard man? Don't maske me fucking laugh!

Id: [0x000B3082]
Least you shut the old goat up about fucking Balaclava!

Id: [0x000B3083]
Ow! The fuck was that?

Id: [0x000B3084]
Fuck off, wasp!

Id: [0x000B3086]
This isn't fucking over! Ferris is dead, but we'll rise again!

Id: [0x000B3088]
Shame Elliotson never had the chance to carve up your fucking brain!

Id: [0x000B308A]
Roth was a traitor. You'll join him in Hell.

Id: [0x000B308C]
You call yourselves the Rooks? How adorable.

Id: [0x000B308E]
You owe us for the gold we were owed from the Bank of England.

Id: [0x000B3090]
Did you think that buses were the key to our power?

Id: [0x000B3093]
A discreet short groan as an NPC remains in an unconscious state

Id: [0x000B3095]
Brewster's death merely delayed the inevitable.

Id: [0x000B3097]
So you killed Ferris. He was inconsequential.

Id: [0x000B3099]
You killed a Member of Parliament. That makes you a terrorist.

Id: [0x000B309A]
[Hissed intake of breath in pain]What was that? Just a momentary ache, I suppose.

Id: [0x000B309B]
[woozy groan that you then shake off]That was passing strange.

You weren't worthy to lick Crawford Starrick's boots, let along murder him.

Id: [0x000B309F]
Elliotson was a madman in a house full of madmen. Well done ending his life.

Id: [0x000B30A1]
How could you burn down the Alhambra?

Id: [0x000B30A3]
You'll never win out over the Blighters, alley cat!

Id: [0x000B30A5]
You think because you killed Twopenny you can kill me, too?!

It'll be a privilege to take down Brewster's killer.

Id: [0x000B30AE]
You're the Assassin they found at Ferris Ironworks, aren't you?

Id: [0x000B30B0]
Brudenell did more for the Empire than you could ever dream!

Id: [0x000B30B1]
Ow! [suspicious]What was that?

Id: [0x000B30B2]
[woozy groan that you shake off]What was that? Poison?!

Id: [0x000B30B4]
Did you think killing Starrick would end the Templars?

Id: [0x000B30B6]
Starrick's Soothing Syrup would've changed the face of London!

Id: [0x000B30B8]
Roth was a weakling. How about a true challenge?!

Id: [0x000B30BA]
Kaylock had nothing on me! Come on!

Id: [0x000B30BC]
The Bank of England was ours for the taking!

Id: [0x000B30BE]
You've killed Starrick's flesh and blood. Now I'll have yours!

Id: [0x000B30C3]
Mr. Brewster was doing the Lord's work, you worm!

Id: [0x000B30C5]
I'll give you much worse than you gave to Ferris.

Id: [0x000B30C7]
I hope you're proud of murdering a war hero!

Id: [0x000B30C8]
Ow! Oh, someone's going to pay for that!

Id: [0x000B30C9]
[woozy groan you then recover from]I've had worse.

Id: [0x000B30CB]
The Templars will live on beyond Starrick!

Id: [0x000B30CD]
I suppose you're the one who slew Dr. Elliotson.

Id: [0x000B30CE]
Hah!

Id: [0x000B30CF]
Hahaha!

You call that a fight?

Id: [0x000B30DA]
That was bloody disgraceful!

Id: [0x000B30DB]
Come on, where's the fire?

Id: [0x000B30DC]
Hah!

Id: [0x000B30DD]
That's a hell of a butcher's bill.

Id: [0x000B30DE]
How's that for a batty-fanging?

Id: [0x000B30DF]
Bang up to the elephant.

Id: [0x000B30E0]
You're not up to dick.

Id: [0x000B30E1]
Teach you to shake a fannin at me.

Id: [0x000B30E2]
Done and dusted.

What's this?

Id: [0x000B30E7]
I'm not feeling well, suddenly...

Id: [0x000B30EA]
My lady, how can I help?

Id: [0x000B30EB]
Hullo madam, what can I help you with?

Id: [0x000B30EC]
Looking for something in particular, miss?

Id: [0x000B30F1]
You do me a good turn. Thank you.

Id: [0x000B30F2]
I believe that shall help you greatly!

Id: [0x000B30F3]
If you need anything else, you know where to find me!

Id: [0x000B30F4]
You have excellent taste!

Id: [0x000B30F6]
Everything you've ever wanted, right here!

Id: [0x000B30F7]
Oh, stop by, would you? I have something that might interest you!

Id: [0x000B30F8]
Come now! I see that glint in your eye! You're in the mood to shop!

Id: [0x000B30F9]
Come! Look at my wares! Something will definitely be of interest to YOU!

Id: [0x000B30FA]
[Knowingly]What? Oh no...

Id: [0x000B30FB]
I've been drugged! Stay away!

Id: [0x000B30FD]
Can I be of some help, madam?

Id: [0x000B30FE]
I believe I have just the thing for you, my dear.

Id: [0x000B30FF]
What can I help you with, miss?

Id: [0x000B3101]
Take a gander, sir! Take a gander!

Id: [0x000B3102]
Anything to your liking, sir?

Id: [0x000B3103]
See anything you like?

Id: [0x000B3105]
If you change your mind, do come back!

Id: [0x000B3106]
I'll be right here if you change your mind!

Id: [0x000B3107]
Do come see me again!

Id: [0x000B3108]
Nothing to your liking? Well do come check again soon!

Excellent choice. I hope to see you again.

Id: [0x000B310E]
Come back again, you hear?

Id: [0x000B310F]
I hope everything was to your... satisfaction.

Id: [0x000B3110]
If you are pleased, I am pleased.

Id: [0x000B3112]
There must be something of interest here...

Id: [0x000B3113]
Come take a look at what I've managed to conjure up today.

Id: [0x000B3114]
Rare finds here! Come... Have a gander.

Id: [0x000B3115]
Nothing but the highest quality goods. Look for yourself.

Id: [0x000B3116]
Something's come over me...

Id: [0x000B3117]
I feel dizzy all of a sudden.

Id: [0x000B3119]
Hullo, my lady!

Id: [0x000B311A]
What can I do for you now, miss?

Id: [0x000B311B]
Feast your eyes, miss! Only the best available here!

Id: [0x000B311D]
Can I help you, sir?

Id: [0x000B311E]
You look like a curious fellow. What can I do you for?

Id: [0x000B311F]
Sir! How can I be of service?

Id: [0x000B3121]
Do come back again...

Id: [0x000B3122]
I'm sorry there is nothing to your liking.

Id: [0x000B3123]
Leaving empty handed? Pity...

Id: [0x000B3124]
Shame to leave behind such good product.

Id: [0x000B312A]
Have a good day, now.

Id: [0x000B312B]
Tah very much.

Id: [0x000B312C]
You have a pleasant day now.

Id: [0x000B312E]
You won't find better!

Id: [0x000B312F]
Best in the whole city!

Id: [0x000B3130]
Everything you need to survive the streets, right here!

Id: [0x000B3131]
The very best of London! Buy now!

Id: [0x000B3132]
What's this? Poison!

Id: [0x000B3133]
I feel a bit off...

Id: [0x000B3135]
You looking for something in particular, lady?

Id: [0x000B3136]
You look like the poisoning type.

Id: [0x000B3137]
Can I help you, miss?

Id: [0x000B3139]
Can I help you, sir?

Id: [0x000B313A]
I think there's a lot that will appeal to you, sir.

Id: [0x000B313B]
This is the right place for a fellow like you.

Id: [0x000B313D]
Not good enough for the likes of you?

Id: [0x000B313E]
You think I've got all the time in the world?

Id: [0x000B313F]
Not buyin'? Then away with you.

Id: [0x000B3140]
I don't have time for games.

Show me how you took down that old fart!

Id: [0x000B316A]
I won't mourn Fat Ferris!

Id: [0x000B316C]
Been busy making pretty explosions, have we?

Id: [0x000B316E]
I'll have what I was due from Twopenny, one way or another!

Id: [0x000B3170]
I'll carve your ass for what you did to Roth!

Id: [0x000B3172]
All you Rooks can kiss my ass!

Id: [0x000B3174]
You're the killer from Lambeth Asylum, aren't you?!

Id: [0x000B3176]
So you killed that rail baron? Who gives a toss?

Id: [0x000B3178]
Oh, no, you destroyed some buses! What will we do?!

Id: [0x000B3179]
[Annoyed ONO, initially a cry of pain, followed by a dismissive "hmph".]

There won't be any poems about you, you ninny!

Id: [0x000B3181]
Allow me to do what Ferris couldn't!

Id: [0x000B3183]
Brewster's death doesn't mean a thing to me!

Id: [0x000B3185]
We could've had the Bank of England, you git!

Id: [0x000B3187]
The Blighters will love me for killing Roth's murderer!

Id: [0x000B3189]
Fly back to your nest, Rooks!

Id: [0x000B318B]
Go back to the Asylum!

Id: [0x000B318D]
I'm tougher than any of the toffs you killed!

Id: [0x000B318F]
You ought to have sunk in the Thames with Millner's ferries!

Id: [0x000B3190]
No. No... Calm yourself, man. You're fine.

You may frighten the skeletons at Parliament, but I'm unimpressed!

Id: [0x000B3198]
I hope you had a lovely stay at Ferris Ironworks!

Id: [0x000B319A]
The trouble you caused in Croydon is meaningless!

Id: [0x000B319C]
If I can't get gold from the Bank, I'll earn it from selling your corpse!

Id: [0x000B319E]
Roth was weak. I'm not!

Id: [0x000B31A0]
Rexford Kaylock has nothing on me!

Id: [0x000B31A2]
I spent a spell in Lambeth Asylum! Elliotson was a genius!

Id: [0x000B31A4]
If I kill you, that makes me stronger than Crawford Starrick!

Id: [0x000B31A6]
I would've stopped you from killing Attaway!

Id: [0x000B31A7]
Oh good, now I'm getting sick.

Perfect. Poisoned again.

Id: [0x000B31AF]
You're a long way from Croydon, shitstain!

Id: [0x000B31B1]
I know you. You did in Brewster!

Id: [0x000B31B3]
I earned that gold from the Bank!

Id: [0x000B31B5]
Holy piss, it's Roth's killer!

Id: [0x000B31B7]
The Rooks aren't wanted here!

Id: [0x000B31B9]
They should've locked you up in Lambeth Asylum!

Id: [0x000B31BB]
This shit killed Crawford Starrick!

Id: [0x000B31BD]
Now you've ruined the buses as well!

Id: [0x000B31BE]

You murdered an MP. You're no more than a damned anarchist!

Id: [0x000B31C6]
You have your duty. So do I.

Id: [0x000B31C8]
If it isn't Brewster's murderers.

Id: [0x000B31CA]
I want retribution for the Bank of England!

Id: [0x000B31CC]
How many more music halls will your kind destroy?

Id: [0x000B31CE]
You won't live to regret Kaylock's demise.

Id: [0x000B31D0]
This is for your escapade at the Asylum.

Id: [0x000B31D2]
Starrick's name will live forever!

Id: [0x000B31D4]
We want our engines back!

Id: [0x000B31D5]

No, no...I won't lose myself. Not now.

Brudenell was a man of courage and nobility. Two things you sorely lack!

Id: [0x000B31DD]
You're the devil who broke into Ferris Ironworks?!

Id: [0x000B31DF]
How dare you sabotage our work!

Id: [0x000B31E1]
I shall avenge you, Twopenny!

Id: [0x000B31E3]
Roth was a traitor! I wish I could have killed him myself!

Id: [0x000B31E5]
We shall keep you under our thumb!

Id: [0x000B31E7]
Elliotson did not deserve his fate!

Id: [0x000B31E9]
Your attacks on the Order will not be countenanced!

Id: [0x000B31EB]
Where are our engines, Assassin?!

Id: [0x000B31EC]
I feel...different.  Better.

Id: [0x000B31ED]
[Growl of pain.] What is this? I feel strange...

Parliament was ours! I'll tear you apart!

Id: [0x000B31F4]
I wager Ferris met his death with greater dignity than you will.

Id: [0x000B31F6]
So you killed Brewster? I'll enjoy slitting your throat.

Id: [0x000B31F8]
You should have stayed clear of the Bank of England!

Id: [0x000B31FA]
I was enjoying Roth's performance before you interfered!

Id: [0x000B31FC]
We won't give up London so easily!

Id: [0x000B31FE]
Perhaps I'll cut up your brain, in Elliotson's memory!

Id: [0x000B3200]
I shall make your death slow and painful, for Starrick!

Id: [0x000B3202]
This is for Pearl Attaway!

Id: [0x000B3203]
Everything's spinning...

No, not now...Not like this.

Id: [0x000B320B]
I suppose you slew Mr. Ferris? The man was a clod.

Id: [0x000B320D]
I won't allow anyone else to share David Brewster's fate!

Id: [0x000B320F]
You may have killed Twopenny but I am no Twopenny.

Id: [0x000B3211]
Roth was no better than the filth that followed him.

Id: [0x000B3213]
Kaylock will be avenged today!

Id: [0x000B3215]
Starrick's Soothing Syrup was a perfect invention!

Id: [0x000B3217]
By killing Starrick, you have robbed the world of its future!

Id: [0x000B3219]
You shall join Millner in hell!

I made you, monster! We're both guilty of slaughter! Sisters, brothers, mother's blood...all on my hands! I am guilty, yes, guilty! Come, Ripper! Let's kill each and be done with this bloody tale.

Id: [0x000B322B]
Jack you bastard! You hideous coward! You rip out their vitals and leave them for show...for what? To punish me! Come and meet your maker, you monster!

Id: [0x000B322D]
Jack? Is that you? ... I couldn't stop them! I couldn't save your mother! I couldn't save the Assassins! I'm a monster! A monster, do you hear me!

Id: [0x000B322E]
You butcher! You murderer! You sully the Assassins and break the creed! Stop tormenting me, Jack! I did not mean it to be this way, I wanted to save you...

Id: [0x000B3230]
Now's your chance!

Id: [0x000B3231]
Now, while they're open!

Id: [0x000B3233]
Ha!

Id: [0x000B3234]
Got you!

Id: [0x000B3235]
Nothing to it.

Id: [0x000B3237]
You're finished!

Id: [0x000B3238]
Bloody fool!

Id: [0x000B3239]
I'll crush you!

Id: [0x000B323A]
This ends now!

Id: [0x000B323C]
Well done!

Id: [0x000B323D]

Id: [0x000B323F]
Pull him back down!

Id: [0x000B3240]
Bastard's climbing away!

Id: [0x000B3241]
Where's he going up there?

Id: [0x000B3243]
She's making her way up the wall!

Id: [0x000B3244]
The bloody spider's escaping!

Id: [0x000B3245]
She's scaling the wall!

Id: [0x000B3248]

My love!

Id: [0x000B337F]
My dear!

Id: [0x000B3380]
There you are, dearheart!

Id: [0x000B3381]
Hello, my love!

Id: [0x000B3383]
I had not thought to see you here.

Id: [0x000B3385]
I was visiting my brother. He's down with an ague.

Id: [0x000B3387]
Oh dear, I hope it's not serious.

Id: [0x000B3389]
Well, give him my best. I'll see you at home later, yes?

Id: [0x000B338B]
Of course. I shouldn't be much later than seven. Then perhaps we could dine out?

Id: [0x000B338D]
Sounds lovely.[kiss hand @ 730]Until tonight, then.

Id: [0x000B338F]
Enjoying your constitutional?

Id: [0x000B3391]
Oh, yes. Fresh air does wonders.

Id: [0x000B3393]
"Fresh" is a relative term in London.

Id: [0x000B3395]
Well, I'll not keep you from your perambulations. Until later, my dear.

Id: [0x000B3397]
Enjoy the rest of your day. I'll pick up some chops on my way home, if you'd like?

Id: [0x000B3399]
Perfect.[kiss hand @ 730]I'll see you at home.

Id: [0x000B339B]
How's your sister? And the baby?

Id: [0x000B339D]
Both fine. The baby is strong and healthy.

Id: [0x000B339F]
I am glad to hear it.

Id: [0x000B33A1]
Perhaps we should start giving thought to children of our own, hmm?

Id: [0x000B33A3]
Mm, perhaps we should, at that. Why don't you run along home and wait for me?

Id: [0x000B33A5]
With bated breath.[kiss hand @ 730]Don't be long.

Id: [0x000B33A7]
I thought you were visiting your mother.

Id: [0x000B33A9]
I was. Then I thought I'd take the scenic route home.

Id: [0x000B33AB]
Well, I'm pleased to see you.

Id: [0x000B33AD]
Just the thing to make the rest of my day bearable.

Id: [0x000B33AF]
You always say the sweetest things. Run along now, and I'll see you when you get home.

Id: [0x000B33B1]
Of course.[kiss hand @ 730]

Id: [0x000B33B3]
What are you up to?

Id: [0x000B33B5]
Nothing much. Just a bit of shopping.

Id: [0x000B33B7]
Ah, lovely.

Id: [0x000B33B9]
If you go past my hatter, perhaps you would inquire if my new top hat is ready?

Id: [0x000B33BB]
Certainly. You'll need it before the party next week, in any event.

Id: [0x000B33BD]
Indeed.[kiss hand @ 730]Thank you, dearest.

Id: [0x000B33C1]
I told you to clear off!

Id: [0x000B33C3]
I can explain everything! If you'd just listen!

Id: [0x000B33C5]
I'll wager! Let's hear it then.

Id: [0x000B33D4]
What? You again!

Id: [0x000B33D6]
I've been misunderstood! I swear to you!

Id: [0x000B33D8]
Another excuse? This should be prime.

Id: [0x000B33DC]
You'd better get out of here!

Id: [0x000B33DE]
I came to explain! It's perfectly fine!

Id: [0x000B33E0]
Of course! Spit it out, then.

Id: [0x000B33E2]
Get a move on, Frye!

Id: [0x000B33E3]
We don't have all day! Get cracking!

Id: [0x000B33E4]
Hurry up, man!

Id: [0x000B33E5]
How are you, madam?

Id: [0x000B33E7]
Fine, thank you. [with arm touch @220]Is your dear wife feeling better?

Id: [0x000B33E9]
Much improved, and I thank you for your concern.

Id: [0x000B33EB]
Oh, pish, think nothing of it. You are both very dear friends.

Id: [0x000B33ED]
How, true. Well, then we must have you over for dinner sometime very soon.

Id: [0x000B33EF]
Do take care.

Id: [0x000B33F1]
Lovely to see you again.

Id: [0x000B33F3]
And you. [with arm touch @220]How are you? Recovered from that fever?

Id: [0x000B33F5]
Almost entirely. The doctors say there should be no lasting damage.

Id: [0x000B33F7]
Oh, I am glad to hear that. Fevers can be such nasty things.

Id: [0x000B33F9]
Quite so. But if you'll excuse me, I really must be off.

Id: [0x000B33FB]
Lovely to see you again, goodbye.

Id: [0x000B33FD]
How nice to see you!

Id: [0x000B33FF]
And you, dear fellow! [with arm touch @220]How have you been?

Id: [0x000B3401]
All well in our household. The youngest is over his measles.

Id: [0x000B3403]
Oh, I am glad to hear it! Such a shame when the little ones take ill.

Id: [0x000B3405]
Yes, quite. Gave us a bit of a scare, he did, but that's all passed.

Id: [0x000B3407]
Now, pray excuse me.

Id: [0x000B3409]
What a surprise!

Id: [0x000B340B]
A pleasant one, I hope. [with arm touch @220]Did you hear about our cousin?

Id: [0x000B340D]
I did. A pity, but he always was over-fond of the races.

Id: [0x000B340F]
Ha! It's true, I'm afraid. Never met a bookmaker he didn't like.

Id: [0x000B3411]
Indeed not. But if you'll excuse me, I really must be going.

Id: [0x000B3413]
Take care, cousin.

Id: [0x000B3415]
You're well, I trust?

Id: [0x000B3417]
Well enough, and yourself? [with arm touch @220]I was so sorry to hear about your father.

Id: [0x000B3419]
He went peacefully, at the end. That's all we can ask, I suppose.

Id: [0x000B341B]
If there's anything your wife needs, let me know.

Id: [0x000B341D]
Perhaps I shall ask her to get in touch with you. You are too kind, madam. Too kind by far.

Id: [0x000B341F]
Well, good day to you.

Id: [0x000B3420]
Darling!

Id: [0x000B3422]
There he is!

Id: [0x000B3424]
My love!

Id: [0x000B3426]
My dear.

Id: [0x000B3428]
I've missed you.

Id: [0x000B342A]
And I you, my darling.

Id: [0x000B342C]
What do you think of my new coat?

Id: [0x000B342E]
I thought I'd wear it when we go to your parents' for dinner.

Id: [0x000B3430]
It's lovely, but my father despises that shade. He'll hate it.

Id: [0x000B3432]
Oh yes, very droll, I'm sure he'll set the dogs on me.

Id: [0x000B3434]
Just keeping you on your toes, my love.

Id: [0x000B3500]
What did I tell you?

Id: [0x000B3502]
You must listen! It's the truth!

Id: [0x000B3504]
Oh, for -- tell me then.

Id: [0x000B3508]
You're sozzled again!

Id: [0x000B350A]
I haven't had a drink in weeks! On my oath!

Id: [0x000B350C]
[ono, annoyance]What is it?

Id: [0x000B3518]
Fancy meeting you here.

Id: [0x000B351A]
I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd surprise you.

Id: [0x000B351C]
I've just bought a new coat.

Id: [0x000B351E]
What do you think? I chose your favorite color.

Id: [0x000B3520]
Very fetching. You look an absolute treat.

Id: [0x000B3522]
I'm pleased you like it. I'm told it's the latest fashion.

Id: [0x000B3524]
Suits you down to the ground.

Id: [0x000B3526]
How are you, dear?

Id: [0x000B3528]
Well enough, I suppose.

Id: [0x000B352A]
My digestion is giving me the pip.

Id: [0x000B352C]
I thought those cockles last night were a bit off.

Id: [0x000B352E]
Poor love. Why don't you run along and have some tonic water.

Id: [0x000B3530]
Hm, I think that might be a good idea. I'll see you at home later.

Id: [0x000B3532]
Of course.

Id: [0x000B3534]
You're a handsome devil, do you know that?

Id: [0x000B3536]
I have some small inkling.

Id: [0x000B3538]
After all, look at this suit.

Id: [0x000B353A]
The very definition of dapper.

Id: [0x000B353C]
Mm, and you wear it so well.

Id: [0x000B353E]
It's not hard, you put it on like any other suit.

Id: [0x000B3540]
So pretty. Such a shame there's nothing in that head.

Id: [0x000B3542]
It's good to see you.

Id: [0x000B3544]
And you, my love.

Id: [0x000B3546]
Look, I bought a new watch.

Id: [0x000B3548]
It was expensive, but I think it looks very smart.

Id: [0x000B354A]
Very smart indeed. Of course, now I have to find you a new birthday present.

Id: [0x000B354C]
You don't say? You bought me a watch?

Id: [0x000B354E]
The very one, in fact. At least it means I know your tastes.

Id: [0x000B3551]
Wait! I needed those.

Id: [0x000B3553]
You spent it...

Id: [0x000B3555]
On me clothes! Yes!

Id: [0x000B3557]
Three more waistcoats!

Id: [0x000B3559]
I needed them!

Id: [0x000B355B]
THREE!

Id: [0x000B355D]
Yes! I have to dress smartly to keep my place!

Id: [0x000B355F]

But! It was for a good cause.

Id: [0x000B35B6]
FOR YOU.

Id: [0x000B35B8]
Yes! Exactly!

Id: [0x000B35BA]
Do you ever think of anyone except yourself?

Id: [0x000B35BC]
I was in dire straits!

Id: [0x000B35BE]
Anyone at ALL?

Id: [0x000B35C0]

Id: [0x000B35C2]
You're so selfish!

Id: [0x000B35C6]
Hold hard (on)! I can explain.

Id: [0x000B35C8]
You bought us...

Id: [0x000B35CA]
Only ten cats!

Id: [0x000B35CC]
Ten of them!

Id: [0x000B35CE]
They were so adorable!

Don't worry I promise to keep everything clean!

You're barmy, you know that?

Id: [0x000B35D8]
I'm entirely sober. I swear it!

Id: [0x000B35DA]
I saw you...

Id: [0x000B35DC]
Drinking a glass of water!

Id: [0x000B35DE]
It was wine!

Id: [0x000B35E0]
I have magical powers!

Id: [0x000B35E2]
Not this again!

Id: [0x000B35E4]
It's a burden! I wish I could put a halt to it.

Id: [0x000B35E6]
Why do I even talk to you?

[Ono, coughing]

A word, sir?

Id: [0x000B360E]
Do you know - is there a doctor nearby?

Id: [0x000B3610]
Stay back, plague rat!

Id: [0x000B3612]
Please, sir! I'm ill!

Id: [0x000B3614]
Get away from me!

Id: [0x000B361B]
Oh sir, it's so good to see you!

Id: [0x000B361D]
You just used your hand as a snot-rag!

Id: [0x000B361F]
Where's your manners?

Id: [0x000B3621]
I'll show you manners!

Id: [0x000B3625]
Spare some coin for an old soldier?

Id: [0x000B3627]
Get away from me, offal!

Id: [0x000B3629]
You can just say 'no'!

Id: [0x000B362B]
Stay away from my note-case!

Id: [0x000B362F]
I've a message for you, sir!

Id: [0x000B3631]
You spat on it!

Id: [0x000B3633]
You're to give me twopence for it!

Id: [0x000B3635]
I'll be damned if I do!

Id: [0x000B363A]
How are you?

Id: [0x000B3641]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000B3642]
What a pleasure it is to see you again.

Id: [0x000B3644]
And you as well. Do you have news?

Id: [0x000B3646]
I've written to our cousin.

Id: [0x000B3648]
We should have his reply tomorrow.

Id: [0x000B364A]
It's so very exciting!

Id: [0x000B364C]
Yes, but there are many preparations to be made before we can go

Id: [0x000B364E]
We'll need to hire a carriage...

Id: [0x000B3650]
I'll send the girl for a fly (rented carriage).

Id: [0x000B3652]
Good, then. It's all settled.

Id: [0x000B3654]
Yes.

Id: [0x000B3659]
Vicar.

Id: [0x000B365D]
Good day.

And to you, Vicar.

Id: [0x000B3663]
Why, good morning!

Good day, Vicar.

Id: [0x000B3669]
My son!

Id: [0x000B366B]
Hello, Vicar.

Id: [0x000B366F]
Hullo.

Id: [0x000B3671]
Hello.

Id: [0x000B3673]
Fine, fine. We missed you at service last Sunday.

Id: [0x000B3675]
Next week, I promise.

Id: [0x000B3679]
How are you?

Id: [0x000B367D]
Good to see you.

Id: [0x000B367F]
And you. You'll be at service on Sunday?

Id: [0x000B3681]
Of course.

Id: [0x000B3685]
Nice to see you.

Id: [0x000B3687]
Likewise. The Church thanks you for your kind donation.

Id: [0x000B3689]
The least I could do.

Id: [0x000B368D]
How's the family?

Id: [0x000B368F]
All well. And yours?

Id: [0x000B3691]
Healthy, thank God.

Id: [0x000B3695]
You're well?

Id: [0x000B3697]
Just giving next Sunday's sermon a bit of polish.

Id: [0x000B3699]
I look forward to it.

Id: [0x000B369A]
And how are you today, my dear?

Id: [0x000B369C]
We're all well, thank you. How is your mother?

Id: [0x000B369E]
She's made a full recovery.

Id: [0x000B36A0]
The doctors are astonished.

Id: [0x000B36A2]
Oh, what wonderful news!

Id: [0x000B36A4]
You must be so happy to have her up and about again.

Id: [0x000B36A6]
You should come for tea one afternoon.

Id: [0x000B36A8]
I will!

Id: [0x000B36AA]
Good, then. I'll tell her to expect you.

Id: [0x000B36AC]
Good day.

Id: [0x000B36AF]
Well I hardly expected to see you today!

Id: [0x000B36B1]
Yes, I came back to London early.

Id: [0x000B36B3]
Well, what a lovely surprise!

Id: [0x000B36B5]
Do you have plans for tomorrow?

Id: [0x000B36B7]
Nothing of consequence!

Id: [0x000B36B9]
My evening is free. What do you propose?

Id: [0x000B36BB]
Would you care to go to the Opera?

Id: [0x000B36BD]
Delightful!

Id: [0x000B36BF]
Splendid! I'll send my carriage for you.

Id: [0x000B36C1]
I shall see you then.

Id: [0x000B36C2]
My dear, you look absolutely lovely!

Id: [0x000B36C4]
Flatterer. What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000B36C6]
I'm meeting your brother for dinner.

Id: [0x000B36C8]
Might we entice you to join us?

Id: [0x000B36CA]
Do say you'll come.

Id: [0x000B36CC]
Oh, but I have another engagement! If only you'd caught me an hour earlier.

Id: [0x000B36CE]
Well, that's bad luck. We'll have to try another time.

Id: [0x000B36D2]
It was good to see you.

Id: [0x000B3704]
My god, what are you doing here?

Id: [0x000B3706]
Well, I haven't seen you since your wedding! Let me look at you.

Id: [0x000B3708]
Still a happy husband I hope?

Id: [0x000B370A]
Do I detect a note of envy?

Id: [0x000B370C]
You know, I never thought you'd settle down, but it suits you!

Id: [0x000B370E]
It's a delightful way to live!

Id: [0x000B3711]
They told me you'd be here!

Id: [0x000B3713]
I came partly because I knew you'd be coming! Let me look.

Id: [0x000B3715]
I heard you had scars from that fight.

Id: [0x000B3717]
Oh, truly, it's nothing serious.

Id: [0x000B3719]
Well, I was worried, but you look the same as always!

Id: [0x000B371B]
As handsome as ever!

Id: [0x000B371E]
Here now, lucky to see you here!

Id: [0x000B3720]
Not luck, I came looking for you. What's this about a fight?

Id: [0x000B3722]
Bertie said you had a terrific shiner.

Id: [0x000B3724]
Bertie exaggerates.

Id: [0x000B3726]
Well, he does tend to embellish for a bit of excitement, it's true.

Id: [0x000B3728]
That's one way of putting it.

Id: [0x000B372B]
I never thought you'd really come!

Id: [0x000B372D]
Well, when I read your letter I could hardly refuse! But what's this?

Id: [0x000B372F]
You've not been sleeping.

Id: [0x000B3731]
It's the late evenings dancing.

Id: [0x000B3733]
So that's how you're spending your time? On parties and late nights!

Give me that. If you're hungry, find Clara O'Dea and tell her Evie sent you.

Oi! Give it back. Sharpish!

Id: [0x000B3B44]
Not bad, kid. But next time don't draw so much attention.

Cheeky little devil. In a few more years, there'll be a job with the Rooks for you.

What's happened to the machines?

Id: [0x000B3C61]
This is bad...

Id: [0x000B3C62]
We'll be punished if there's trouble!

Id: [0x000B3C63]
Someone fix them!

Id: [0x000B3C65]
Lord! It's getting worse!

Repair the machines!

We're ruined!

This ain't our fault!

We need repairs! Hurry! 'Fore the guards come!

What's all this?

Which one of you is responsible?

Id: [0x000B3C70]
Wasn't us, sir! I swear it!

Id: [0x000B3C71]
He's tellin' the truth!

Id: [0x000B3C72]
I'll hang you from the chimneys for this!

Id: [0x000B3C73]
But we've done nothing wrong!

Id: [0x000B3C78]
I hope you never find the Shroud. You have no idea what it truly can do.

Id: [0x000B3C79]
Tell me, then.

No.

INT. PALACE OF WESTMINSTER

Id: [0x000B3CBD]
Usually I would be in disguise, but my clothes all fell into the Thames.

Id: [0x000B3CBE]
One of my favorite disguises is a very ancient old lady, modelled after my mother.

Id: [0x000B3CBF]
You'd be surprised how convincing I am.

Id: [0x000B3CC0]
A tough old bird she was. Actually had a facial hair problem. We'd sell the hair for dolls.

Id: [0x000B3CC1]
Please let me know if I am speaking too much. I am prone to flights of fancy.

Id: [0x000B3CC2]
I can continue in song. No?

Id: [0x000B3CC3]
I tend to do that only while in disguise as a chimney sweep, but I'll make an exception just this once because I enjoy your company.

Id: [0x000B3CC4]
No? You do not know what you are missing out on, let me tell you.

Id: [0x000B3CC5]
Well... Parliament is rather boring these days. No singing here.  

Id: [0x000B3CC6]
You should come to Scotland Yard sometime for a performance. I play all the parts.

Id: [0x000B3CC8]
The nerve of Evie. Treating me like a child.

Id: [0x000B3CCA]
Maybe I haven't been quite as delicate as I could have been, but still...

A bit harsh what they did to the station chief.

Id: [0x000B588A]
It was just about the only way to keep the schedule from getting to the conductor down there.

Not a complaint. More an observation.

And yet they are so much more pleasant than yours.

I ought to write an open letter to The Morning Post about this incompetence.

Id: [0x000B58C9]
How long does it take to deliver a ruddy schedule?!

When I find who caused this mess...

Id: [0x000B58F0]
She would sack me for sure. But not if I make an example of someone first.

Id: [0x000B58F1]
Such a glaring flaw as well. Unacceptable.

Darwin's fate is sealed! Goodbye, Assassin. I did so enjoy meeting you.

I'm afraid, my young friend, that some of your enemies want their toxin returned to them.

Id: [0x000B5959]
Might I suggest you position our carriage directly in front of theirs? I believe the fumes will impair their ability to drive.

Id: [0x000B596D]
You're quite right, my young friend! Quite right indeed.

Id: [0x000B5976]
I believe, my young friend, that I might know just the place.

Id: [0x000B598D]
Ah, my young friend! How good it is to see you! Fortunate, really...

Id: [0x000B5998]
The people of London are fortunate to have you on their side, my young friend. Very fortunate indeed!

Id: [0x000B59A6]
Please hurry, my young friend. I'm eager to read that paper.

Id: [0x000B59AD]
My young friend! Today's papers carry a rebuttal of Mr. Owen's slanderous and ignorant remarks about my work.

Id: [0x000B59B7]
You... You saved my life!

Id: [0x000B59D3]
Oh... Were you going somewhere, Assassin?

Id: [0x000B59E5]
Follow me.

Id: [0x000B59E8]
Ah! Thank you, my young friend, thank you! This little orchid may seem inconsequential, but it holds secrets which could potentially change our very understanding of the world.

Id: [0x000B59F1]
My young friend! I'm sorry to be so blunt, but I need to ask a favor of you.

Id: [0x000B59F4]
I need you to collect it for me first.

Anything you want! Just don't hurt me!

As a matter of fact, yes! Follow me!

However, I would very much appreciate it if you would accompany me.

Let me go, you moke!

Don't be daft, everyone knows number fifty's got a secret passage. Here, take it! Just leave me be!

Id: [0x000B5A85]
Perhaps... perhaps I shall wait here while you investigate the source of that laughter, which is not at all unsettling!

Id: [0x000B5A92]
You've been arrested for theft! How very intriguing!

Id: [0x000B5A99]
Let's get you out of here. I've pulled a few strings and they won't prosecute on account of you're losing your mind. Be free, little chicken!

Id: [0x000B5AA4]
You are very much mistaken, and now you are so very, very tired, aren't you?

Id: [0x000B5AAC]
Now you're going to do a little job of work for me, aren't you?

Id: [0x000B5B1C]
I remember what the other victims remember. A silver watch, the sound of a bell and a sort of shadow.

Id: [0x000B5B1D]
My mind is blank, save for the glint of a silver object, the toll of a bell, and a presence of some sort.

Id: [0x000B5B1E]

Id: [0x000B5B1F]
A glint of silver and a tolling bell, eh? [a beat]I must say, you look very tired.

Id: [0x000B5B23]
Yes. I am so very, very tired.

Id: [0x000B5B25]
Yes. I am so very, very tired.

Id: [0x000B5B28]

Id: [0x000B5B2D]
You are very much mistaken, and now you are so very, very tired, aren't you?

Id: [0x000B5B3E]
You've cost me a bit of money, mate, so I think it's only fair that you replenish my coffers with donations from the good people of London.

Id: [0x000B5B4D]
I say, you gave me a terrible fright. Muttering about a man named "Ezio".

Id: [0x000B5B56]
Good, very good. Now, we can't have criminals like you roaming the streets. You will surrender to the police, won't you?

Id: [0x000B5B5D]
Oh, and when you do, you're going to do a silly little dance for them.

Id: [0x000B5B60]
Oh! His accomplices will surely murder you! Quickly, we have not a moment to lose.

Id: [0x000B5B6A]
I owe you my thanks, you have gone to a great deal of trouble for someone you don't even know! What is your name?

Id: [0x000B5B71]
You have preserved my honour and saved my life. I am Elizabeth. Won't you climb down and sit beside me, so that I might see your face?

Id: [0x000B5B74]
Please be more careful!

Id: [0x000B5B75]
My life was already in danger before you arrived!

Id: [0x000B5B76]
I thought you were here to rescue me!

Id: [0x000B5B92]
Who's there? Are you a friend?

Is this your first time doing this?

Id: [0x000B5BB0]

Ah, my dear Darwin, do you think our young friend here, equipped with a multiplicity of talents, might be enough to ensure Mister Hammon safe passage?

Id: [0x000B5BFB]
We fear he'll need a more robust escort than two old men might provide.

Id: [0x000B5C02]
We have already told him to expect you!

Id: [0x000B5C10]
By Jove! You're handy to have around. I fear my wealth attracts too much attention.

Id: [0x000B5C1F]
I say! I have need of your help again!

Id: [0x000B5C21]

What have we here?

Id: [0x000B66CF]
And he's not even Italian!

Id: [0x000B66D0]
Nor Italian, for that matter!

Id: [0x000B66D3]
I admit it! I'm not Italian! It was just for my act! Nobody wanted to see a British hypnotist!

Id: [0x000B66D4]
Oh, shut up!

Id: [0x000B66D6]
I admit it! I'm not Italian! It was just for my act! Nobody wanted to see a British hypnotist!

Id: [0x000B66D7]
I don't care!

Id: [0x000B66DD]
I have a rather artful plan. You, playing the part of a ruffian, will kidnap her. Then you must bring her to where I am waiting.

Id: [0x000B66DE]
I shall leap from a shadowy corner and beat you to a pulp thereby saving her life and winning her heart.

Id: [0x000B66E5]
Now put me down somewhere insalubrious and I shall ready an ambush for you. Somewhere in Lambeth should suffice.

Id: [0x000B66EB]
My people are recovering their explosive cargo. You did fine work today.

Id: [0x000B66FC]
No mere Assassin can stop me!

Id: [0x000B6700]
I suppose you'll kill me now!

Id: [0x000B670A]
Go to hell.

Id: [0x000B671B]
We'll meet again, Assassin!

Id: [0x000B6721]
There's an Assassin over here!

Id: [0x000B6750]
Will you speak to the villain and learn his secrets?

Id: [0x000B6768]
It's the next train! It should leave at any moment!

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE (IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN)

Id: [0x000B6771]
Mister Frye. I grant you leave to order me to leave.

Id: [0x000B6773]
Miss Frye. I grant you leave to order me to leave.

Id: [0x000B6777]
If we can't blow up a building, we'll just have to settle for blowing up an Assassin!

Id: [0x000B6781]
I need you to deal with the Templars. Target one is in a nearby corridor, surrounded by civilians. He has explosives on his person.

Id: [0x000B6782]
You need to take him by surprise. If he sees you, he'll detonate his bomb. In the meantime, I'll search for the Prime Minister.

Id: [0x000B6786]
Don't come any closer!

Id: [0x000B6790]
Not another step, Assassin!

Id: [0x000B6791]
You've lost, don't you see? The Houses of Parliament are rigged to explode at the last stroke of twelve!

Id: [0x000B6795]
Thank you, my young friend. Now, please come with me. You and your sibling have been summoned.

Id: [0x000B67A8]
I can’t sit here all day long waiting for my partner in crime!

Id: [0x000B67AC]
If there’s no sign of my partner in the next minute I shall just have to… sit tight a little more!

Id: [0x000B67BB]
What did you see?

Id: [0x000B67F4]
Try again. Use your powers to peer more deeply and see what you can discover.

Id: [0x000B6801]
Look for more clues.

Id: [0x000B6809]
Re-examine some of the clues more closely.

Id: [0x000B6817]
I was inside, you arse. I wasn't even there!

Id: [0x000B6831]
Ah, yes. Be careful with that, it can be dangerous. It reacts badly with heat.

Id: [0x000B6844]
You very cleverly puzzled that one out! A very unpleasant crime. Perfect for one of Mr. Raymond's penny dreadfuls!

Id: [0x000B6853]
You appreciate, I'm sure, that I cannot discuss the condition of any of my patients.

Id: [0x000B6860]
He's all mine, I tell you! All the girls want a bit of Baxter, but they can’t have him! You ask him yourself—he lives just that way.

Id: [0x000B6866]
I knew something was amiss with the medical powder, but didn't understand until you found those papers. Well done!

Id: [0x000B6880]
I hoped you wouldn’t find that. I'm afraid several of the faculty purchase cadavers for research purposes. It’s a fact of university life.

Id: [0x000B688C]
I know the man. He’s hated by everyone! Surprisingly, it’s not clear what killed him. I find multiple wounds. No need to send many people to jail for killing such a terrible man. What say you only arrest the single person who actually caused his death.

Id: [0x000B68A3]
Crime never pays you know.

Id: [0x000B68B0]
There you are! This could be interesting. There's no shortage of firearms in this neighborhood!

Id: [0x000B68B2]
There may be a penny dreadful in it! Look into it, won't you?

Id: [0x000B68C3]
What are you talking about, I'm a bloody policeman! Think again! Whoever did this had a very strong motive.

Id: [0x000B68CB]
A white feather? That's an Ashanti symbol. Sign of cowardice. Why? You seen one somewhere?

Id: [0x000B68F1]
You better hurry. It's leaving right now!

Id: [0x000B68F9]
Peter? Nice bloke. Came here after being sacked from a foundry a few months ago. I'll tell you, he looked white as a ghost after he served the businessmen.

Id: [0x000B68FC]
She’s a frequent passenger, that one. Hangs about with the wealthier sort. Likes to ‘entertain’ ‘em, if you take my meanin’.

Id: [0x000B6910]
The rich fella? I did talk with him. Very charming, but a single woman has to be careful, you know. Did something happen to him?

Id: [0x000B691B]
It was a typical evening. As far as I knew, nothing unusual happened until you came aboard with this story of a murder.

Id: [0x000B693F]
My dear friend, The Ghost Club has an extraordinary case for you. Spiritualist Thaddeus the Amazing has predicted his own death at his next séance! Could you have a look?

Id: [0x000B6943]
I have foretold my own death.

Id: [0x000B6952]
I ask that you avert your eyes while I open the vault.

Id: [0x000B695B]
You cannot imagine that someone was after the Scepter? I must see it!

Id: [0x000B6967]
Y'know, when he thought somethin' was important, he'd write it up in invisible ink. Lemon juice, like.

Id: [0x000B6971]
Follow the clues!

Id: [0x000B697B]
Look beyond the obvious, beyond surface appearances.

Id: [0x000B6983]
You are more naïve than you appear.

Id: [0x000B6995]
While you were chasing all those people around, I absconded with the queen. A hefty ransom is now due.

Id: [0x000B699D]
I simply watched the queen open the safe when you arrived!

Id: [0x000B69A1]
I have stolen the queen's most prized possession, the Scepter with the Dove! Think of it! I have out-foxed you! The most cunning detective in Britain. I mocked you by leaving clues for you at every turning point! Now I have the Scepter, proof positive of my superiority!

Id: [0x000B69A4]
You have done well. Indeed, far better than I expected. But you cannot win. Make a single move and young Artie's murder will feature in my next story!

Id: [0x000B69B2]
I did see Artie's friend, Mr. Raymond. He'd just come from Purlock Publishing with his new penny dreadful. Seemed very excited about it. I never liked him much.

Id: [0x000B69D7]
That's Dooley's knife, all right. He never lent it to nobody.

Oh!

But first!

Id: [0x000B6D47]
I shalll reveal to each of you the answers you seek.

You are about to witness an extraordinary event.

He's actually dead!

I shalll reveal to each of you the answers you seek.

Id: [0x000B6D6C]
Come now, gentlemen, I'd thought us united in opposition against this perfidious law.

Id: [0x000B6DFD]
If the majority party is allowed to dictate the results of contested elections, we can scarcely call ourselves free.

Id: [0x000B6DFE]
You would rather throw your body upon the gears of progress than surrender one iota of power!

Id: [0x000B6DFF]
I'll not stand idly by and watch you drag Parliamentary privilege through the muck!

Id: [0x000B6E00]
Perhaps while we're at it, Mister Gladstone, we could repeal Magna Carta and return the crown to the bloody Stuarts!

Id: [0x000B6E01]
Merely because I do not wish to see government placed in the hands of judges, you would make these slanderous accusations?

Id: [0x000B6E02]
I'll not stand for it!

Id: [0x000B71FA]
[Laugh]

Id: [0x000B7204]
A gentleman with ties to Parliament. Older, wears cavalry uniforms and has a large moustache?

Id: [0x000B7205]
The lawn is crawling with scandal-hunting journalists, and I simply cannot be seen in the company of someone so...

We may make mistakes while dancing, but, the mazurka ends and then we begin again.

Id: [0x000B724D]
Isn't everyone around you repeating the same steps? But if one man could remember the dance?

Id: [0x000B724E]
Could know the time? Then he could change things for the better.

Id: [0x000B724F]
Soon the people will forget the generation on this terrace, the ruin you nearly wrought on London.

Id: [0x00989CCE]
Let's see... and...

Id: [0x00989CD0]
There should be twelve! They were delivered just this morning.

Id: [0x00989CD1]
Manifest says 10.

Id: [0x00989CD2]
[frustrated sigh]The Board will have my head if we're short.

[humming softly as you count to yourself]Call this a dozen.

Id: [0x00989CD4]
[thinking to yourself]Mark down...

Id: [0x00989CDA]
Hmm, that's a very fetching dress, that is.

Id: [0x00989CDB]
You like it?

Id: [0x00989CDC]
Just the thing.

Id: [0x00989CDD]
Tonight. And you won't know what hit you.

Id: [0x00989CDE]
I can scarcely wait.

Id: [0x00989CDF]
Well ain't you got a silver tongue in your head?

Id: [0x00989CE0]
It appears we both have our pleasant bits.

Id: [0x00989CE2]
Where did you get that dress?

Id: [0x00989CE3]
Oh, this old thing?

Id: [0x00989CE4]
Very fetching on you, my love.

Id: [0x00989CE5]
Mm, well now, aren't you just the most charming fellow?

Id: [0x00989CE6]
Only for you. You bring it out in me.

Id: [0x00989CE7]
You like me new dress?

Id: [0x00989CEA]
Oh, you cheeky bugger! I'll get you for that!

Id: [0x00989D0B]
We were counting on your pay, Stephen! How are we to pay the rent now? Did you think of that?

Id: [0x00989D0C]
The patent office was a living hell, Mabel, you know it was. I'll find work elsewhere. There are so many positions open for a file clerk in this city. If I had your support-

Id: [0x00989D0D]
Couldn't you find another job before giving up this one? Shouldn't have been too difficult, "so many positions"?

Id: [0x00989D0E]
Now, see here-

Id: [0x00989D0F]
Look, we have a little one on the way, Stephen, and he shouldn't have to go hungry because your temper got the better of you at the office!

Id: [0x00989D10]
You make a mockery of what I had to endure in that office by dismissing it as "my temper." If only you knew-

Id: [0x00989D11]
What are we going to do now?!

Id: [0x00989D12]
I don't know!

Id: [0x00989D13]
I'll always be by your side, Stephen, but you make it so difficult!

Id: [0x00989D14]
I know I do. Which makes me all the more grateful that you are and remain my wife. I'll find something else. I promise you that. The rent will be paid and the little one will remain unaffected. Do you trust me to keep my promise, Mabel?

Id: [0x00989D19]
Now's your time, come and buy the most beautiful products in London!

Id: [0x00989D1A]
The world's greatest bargains are here, they ain't next door!

Id: [0x00989D1B]
You there ! I can see you hesitating. You think it's too expensive!

Id: [0x00989D1C]
But ask yourself - are you willing to sacrifice quality just to save a few pennies?

Id: [0x00989D1E]
Fine ladies and kind gentlemen! I've good prices for bulk purchase!

Id: [0x00989D1F]
The most beautiful objects in London are here, and nowhere else!

Id: [0x00989D20]
I can see you think it is expensive, but that's because it is the very best!

Id: [0x00989D21]
Hurry, hurry, my stock is already running low! It won't last!

Id: [0x00989D23]
Pick 'em up on the cheap! I'll be here all day long!

Id: [0x00989D24]
I have items for a connoisseur's eye. And for ladies with exquisite taste!

Id: [0x00989D25]
Your kids are gonna love'em, they marvel at the smallest things!

Id: [0x00989D26]
My friend over there, I must tell you - he has scabies!

Id: [0x00989D27]
I can sell you everything you need!

Id: [0x00989D28]
Step up to the counter! I have  exceptional lot, for today only!

Id: [0x00989D29]
This opportunity comes just once in a lifetime!

Id: [0x00989D2A]
Be careful, ladies and gentlemen, this market is full or charlatans!

Id: [0x00989D2B]
Buy here, it will bring happiness to your entire family!

Id: [0x00989D2C]
You won't regret your choice!

Id: [0x00989D2D]
Whatever you are looking for, I have it in stock!

Id: [0x00989D2E]
Only two pennies for three, no better prices elsewhere!

Id: [0x00989D2F]
They say money can't buy happiness, but they've never shopped here!

Id: [0x00989D30]
You're pennies away from an excellent purchase!

Id: [0x00989D31]
Don't be shy! Give in to temptation!

Id: [0x00989D39]
I love you, my dear.

Id: [0x00989D3A]
I love you, too.

Id: [0x00989D3B]
Look, my dear! A starling!

Id: [0x00989D3D]
One day all of this will be ours.

Id: [0x00989D3E]
Best get on with it. See you tonight, love.

Id: [0x00989D8B]
Look at that, my dove.

Id: [0x00989D8C]
What is it?

Id: [0x00989D8D]
Nothing half as lovely as you.

Id: [0x00989D8E]
Oh, well, then, if all you want's a kiss...

Id: [0x00989D97]
What's that, then?

Id: [0x00989D98]
What? Where?

Id: [0x00989D99]
Just the prettiest girl in all of London.

Id: [0x00989DC7]
I see what you do not! Flickering at the corners of my vision, a shadow of the larger truth! But it must be seen obliquely or else it disappears! Ah yes, the ground beneath your feet wasn't made by the Almighty, but placed there by the hand of man! This body is an illusion! You're blind, blind I tell you!

Id: [0x00989DC8]
Why is no one listening? I am not mad! You'll see! Soon the shards of reality will come crumbling down and we'll all be trapped in a great featureless void!

Id: [0x00989DD4]
People of London! Are you tired of breaking your back in factories all day, and most of the night? Are you tired of coming home to sleep on the floor with an empty belly? My friends, we must rise up! Rise up and fight!

Id: [0x00989DD5]
The rich don't care about you! Everything they own, they acquired on the backs of your labor - We must free ourselves from this slavery to survive! We must rise up!

Id: [0x00989DD6]
I believe - as I know you believe! That we must be paid a living wage!

Id: [0x00989E2A]
Oi, mate. Help a poor soul get by, will you?

Id: [0x00989E2B]
Trying to earn your next drink? I'll have none of it!

Id: [0x00989E2D]
Piss on it!

Id: [0x00989E2E]
Where's your empathy for your fellow man? Rich bugger!

Id: [0x00989E67]
Well, if that don't beat all...

Id: [0x00989E68]
Who is it?

Id: [0x00989E69]
She... she used to live in our street. That's all.

Id: [0x00989E6B]
Where can he be?

Id: [0x00989E6C]
He'll come, don't worry.

Id: [0x00989E6D]
Oi! I'm not worried. You are!

Id: [0x00989E75]
G-good day, sir.

Id: [0x00989E76]
That new coat sits well, sir.

Id: [0x00989E77]
No thanks to you, Higgins! Those moths are still everywhere in my dressing room! This is the only outfit the devils left intact! I should take the cost of those garments out of your wages!

Id: [0x00989E78]
Don't you stare at me like that, you pig-eyed worm. Your father would be ashamed to see what a muff (fool) you've become.

Id: [0x00989E8C]
What about her? She could be prime minister.

Id: [0x00989E8D]
Go on! You're embarrassing me!

Id: [0x00989E8E]
Just imagine the wisdom we could glean from a woman leading parliament.

Id: [0x00989E8F]
No offense, my dear, but I believe there is a reason no woman's ever entered politics.

Id: [0x00989E90]
You're right, there is a very good reason indeed!

Id: [0x00989E91]
Pay him no mind. He's talking rubbish.

Id: [0x00989E92]
That much is certain.

Id: [0x00989E93]
Is it rubbish to believe that things are fine the way they are?

Id: [0x00989E95]
Come on! We ain't got all day!

Id: [0x00989E96]
Excuse me, but this gentleman was here first.

Id: [0x00989E97]
[clears throat] I need a- a certain product for a... delicate matter, can you help?

Id: [0x00989E98]
You gonna let him ignore us like that?

Id: [0x00989E99]
Won't be a moment, madam!

Id: [0x00989E9A]
Yes, sir, I have exactly what you need!

Id: [0x00989E9B]
Look, here's a penny extra if you see to us first.

Id: [0x00989E9C]
Yes, of course sir. As soon as I'm finished with this gentleman, I'll be right with you.

Id: [0x00989E9D]
Oi, what about me?

Id: [0x00989E9E]
This isn't what I asked for!

Id: [0x00989E9F]
Oh, good heavens! Just a minute.

Id: [0x00989EF6]
Titania? Are you here, my Queen? I have come, as you requested. I am yours!

Id: [0x00989EF7]
I hear you but I cannot see you! Come my Queen, do not be afraid. Where do you want to play, your Grace? Your wish is my command!

Id: [0x00989EF8]
But I obeyed, I did all you asked me to do! Why are you punishing me? Oh, I am confused, I did not know he was your friend!

Id: [0x00989EF9]
What are you looking at? Have you never seen a sprite before? Heeey, yeeees, me. And you, you are VERY VERY UGLY! Ha ha ha, out of my sight, pimpled newt.

Id: [0x00989EFC]
The truth, the truuuuuuuuth, I know it, I do! And you do not! You do not know how to SEE what you should look at, you cannot hear what you should LISTEN TO! But I can! My secret? I am not telling yooooooou. Heeey, nooooooo. It is infuriating, but it is legal!

Id: [0x00989EFD]
I spoke to father this morning at breakfast, and he was very impressed by your proposition.

Id: [0x00989EFE]
I am very glad to hear it.

Id: [0x00989EFF]
I believe it gives him peace of mind to know that he can retire without the family business going to ruin.

Id: [0x00989F00]
I hope he'd remain a guiding hand, at the very least. I believe this will be a golden age for the jewelry shop, and for the whole Dawson family. If you'll allow me a moment to boast, I know I'll be able to make our dreams come true.

Id: [0x00989F01]
To our dreams!

Id: [0x00989F08]
The people here absolutely reek of desperate attempts to display confidence and affluence, and therefore they fail on both counts.

Id: [0x00989F09]
Leave them be, they must have been through hard times.

Id: [0x00989F0A]
Why should we be subjected to their misery?

Id: [0x00989F0B]
You know what they say about pride and falls, my dear. Heaven forefend, but we might very well be the subject of mocking japes ourselves one day.

Id: [0x00989F0C]
Do you think I would allow that to happen? I'd rather drink from the Thames.

Id: [0x00989F0D]
Don't make me ill, my dear.

Id: [0x00989F10]
If you could live anywhere else in the world, where would it be?

Id: [0x00989F11]
Anywhere else in the world? Why would I? Have I been sentenced to transportation?

Id: [0x00989F12]
Not yet.

Id: [0x00989F13]
They might as well put me to death, for I couldn't ever leave London!

Id: [0x00989F14]
It's just a question in fun, my dear.

Id: [0x00989F15]
I tell you what: the furthest I ever intend to go is Swindon. [beat]I hear Quebec is lovely.

Id: [0x00989F16]
Well, then. Here's to us.

Id: [0x00989F17]
Forever and ever, amen!

Id: [0x00989F26]
My life would be so diminished without you.

Id: [0x00989F27]
Come close, I have a secret to tell you.

Id: [0x00989F28]
[laughter]

Id: [0x00989F29]
[laughter]

Id: [0x00989F2A]
That is truly a story for the ages!

Id: [0x00989F9F]
Yes, sir, thank you, sir.

Id: [0x00989FA8]
That's two pints and some claret... Do you want anything to eat, sir? We've fine trout. Or would you prefer beef?

Id: [0x00989FA9]
Is Arthur working tonight?

Id: [0x00989FAA]
If he's cooking, I'll stick to beer. [ONO, laugh]

Id: [0x00989FAB]
Ahem... No, it's Maria.

Id: [0x00989FAC]
In that case, I'll have some fried fish.

Id: [0x00989FAD]
I will as well.

Id: [0x00989FAF]
For dessert tonight we have an excellent selection of pies, both savory and sweet. Does that interest anyone?

Id: [0x00989FB0]
Trouble is, I don't much care for pie.

Id: [0x00989FB1]
Nor do I. It's hard on the digestion.

Id: [0x00989FB3]
No pie? I could ask in the kitchen if they've anything else...

Id: [0x00989FB4]
Not for me.

Id: [0x00989FB5]
I think I shall forego anything more tonight, thank you.

Id: [0x00989FB6]
And then the rope says "I'm a frayed knot"![chuckling]

Id: [0x00989FB7]
All right, here's one. Why don't street-musicians play hide-and-seek?

Id: [0x00989FB8]
I dunno - why not?

Id: [0x00989FB9]
Because no one ever wants to find them!

Id: [0x00989FBA]
Oh, that's a good one. By the bye, did you know there's a group of us, a club, we meet down the way to work on our jokes. We're putting together a Shakespeare burlesque.

Id: [0x00989FC0]
Did I ever tell you about the time I nearly journeyed to America with Wilkinson?

Id: [0x00989FC1]
Did you really?

Id: [0x00989FC2]
Ah, I was young and foolish. Hungry for action, too. But I was a terrible sailor.

Id: [0x00989FC3]
Goodness! I've heard seasickness can be quite a trial.

Id: [0x00989FC4]
It is. But I didn't stick with it, either. My pride was injured.

Id: [0x00989FC5]
How far did you make it?

Id: [0x00989FC6]
I got off at Shannon. The captain said he was glad to be rid of me!

Id: [0x00989FCB]
Ah! A true pleasure to see you again.

Id: [0x00989FCC]
Flatterer. But do tell me how you've been.

Id: [0x00989FCD]
Ah, well, it's been a long time, hasn't it? Where to begin?

Id: [0x00989FCF]
May I say how delighted I am to see you!

Id: [0x00989FD0]
You may not. Honestly, you're being overbearing again and I won't put up with it.

Id: [0x00989FD1]
How's your mother?

Id: [0x00989FD2]
[ONO, coughing]

Id: [0x00989FD3]
Oh! This must be the dress you wrote about. It's wonderful. I adore the color.

Id: [0x00989FD4]
Why thank you. It's the latest style - had it made custom.

Id: [0x00989FD5]
You have a truly remarkable eye for fashion.

Id: [0x0098A05E]
Toi! Comment oses-tu montrer ta vilaine figure!

Id: [0x0098A05F]
Ma mie, calme-toi. Je peux tout t'expliquer.

Id: [0x0098A060]
J'attends.

Id: [0x0098A061]
Tout cela n'est qu'un immense malentendu.

Id: [0x0098A062]
Tu me prends pour une idiote? Alors que je t'ai vu, la main dans son corsage?

Id: [0x0098A063]
Seulement une amie, tu disais?

Id: [0x0098A064]
Mais laisse-moi t'expliquer, voyons.

Id: [0x0098A065]
Essaye!

Id: [0x0098A066]
Nous mangions du raisin…

Id: [0x0098A067]
Du raisin? Tu achètes du raisin pour cette traînée?

Id: [0x0098A068]
Disparais de ma vue. Retourne donc avec ton "amie", tiens, et vois si elle aura la patience de supporter tes frasques. Moi, j'en ai fini. Suffit!

Id: [0x0098A069]
Mais ma mie… je t'en supplie…

Id: [0x0098A06A]
Disparais à présent!

Id: [0x0098A06B]
There you are!

Id: [0x0098A073]
There she is!

Id: [0x0098A07B]
What a divine sight.

Id: [0x0098A07C]
I truly mean it.

Id: [0x0098A07D]
You are a picture of loveliness walking these drab streets. And is that a new frock?

Id: [0x0098A07E]
You shall make me blush.

Id: [0x0098A07F]
Red becomes you.

Id: [0x0098A080]
My! You are looking particularly handsome today.

Id: [0x0098A081]
Even more so than last night.

Id: [0x0098A082]
Is it any wonder you had so many suitors at my party? I hope though that you enjoyed our dance most of all.

Id: [0x0098A083]
It was tolerable.

Id: [0x0098A084]
Indeed! I could ask for no higher praise!

Id: [0x0098A097]
How do you--?

Id: [0x0098A098]
Ugh. I must rush.

Id: [0x0098A099]
Greetings, my good--

Id: [0x0098A09A]
Sorry. In a dreadful hurry.

Id: [0x0098A09B]
Beg pardon, sir, would you have a pound or two for...

Id: [0x0098A09C]
Keep your distance.

Id: [0x0098A09D]
There's no need for that!

Id: [0x0098A09E]
Stay back!

Id: [0x0098A0A5]
I hoped I would see you here!

Id: [0x0098A0A6]
I almost thought you had been avoiding me!

Id: [0x0098A0A7]
Shall we have a drink? A little supper? We have so much to talk about!

Id: [0x0098A0A8]
Perhaps some other time. I have business to attend to.

Id: [0x0098A0AA]
This IS a pleasant surprise!

Id: [0x0098A0AB]
I hope your standing for office is going well?

Id: [0x0098A0AC]
It would be dreadful if any skeletons in the cupboard where to emerge now, wouldn't it?

Id: [0x0098A0AD]
Yes, yes, now I really must be going.

Id: [0x0098A0AF]
It's my boots, constable. They have a mind of their own, insisting on taking me where they please.

Id: [0x0098A0B0]
That is not my concern.

Id: [0x0098A0B1]
But what if they jump in the river or in front of a train?

Id: [0x0098A0B2]
Look, sir...

Id: [0x0098A0B3]
A rare pleasure.

Id: [0x0098A0B4]
The pleasure is mine.

Id: [0x0098A0B5]
I don't believe I've seen you since that evening at Mrs. Crossley's.

Id: [0x0098A0B6]
You danced beautifully that night. I shall never forget the way you looked.

Id: [0x0098A0B7]
But I daresay you are quite forgetting yourself now.

Id: [0x0098A0B8]
I cannot help it. You have enchanted me.

Id: [0x0098A0B9]
I never thought I'd see you here!

Id: [0x0098A0BA]
By jove, it's good to see you.

Id: [0x0098A0BB]
Let me look at you! Dapper as always!

Id: [0x0098A0BD]
You know, I never thought you'd come back from the colonies, yet here you are!

Id: [0x0098A0BE]
I came back for some good plain English cooking!

Id: [0x0098A0C0]
If you could just tell me...

Id: [0x0098A0C1]
I don't have time for this!

Id: [0x0098A0C2]
I have an urgent matter to..

Id: [0x0098A0C3]
It will have to wait!

Id: [0x0098A0C4]
I wonder if you could tell me...

Id: [0x0098A0C5]
I don't have time right now!

Id: [0x0098A18F]
Oh god... blast it... it's disgusting... ugh.

Id: [0x0098A22B]
Another toast!

Id: [0x0098A31A]
Ah te voilà! Tu peux numéroter des abattis!

Id: [0x0098A31B]
Enfin mais de quoi parles-tu? Tu es déjà ivre?

Id: [0x0098A31C]
Quel culot!

Id: [0x0098A31D]
Ce n'est pas moi qui passe mon temps à la taverne!

Id: [0x0098A31E]
Si je perds mon temps dans les tavernes, c'est pour venir t'y chercher!

Id: [0x0098A31F]
Combien as-tu perdu cette fois-ci?

Id: [0x0098A320]
J'ai joué de malchance, ça va changer.

Id: [0x0098A321]
Sagouin!

Id: [0x0098A322]
Je ne te permets pas…

Id: [0x0098A323]
Par contre dilapider le peu d'argent, ça tu le permets!

Id: [0x0098A324]
Je te préviens Armand! Si tu touches encore à une seule de ces cartes de malheur, c'est mes frères qui se chargeront de te ramener à la raison!

Id: [0x0098A325]
Il ferait beau voir que tu oses...

Id: [0x0098A326]
Ne me tente pas!

Id: [0x0098A329]
Te voilà, on m'avait dit que je te trouverais ici!

Id: [0x0098A32A]
Quelle agréable surprise, chère voisine!

Id: [0x0098A32B]
Faquin!

Id: [0x0098A32C]
Mais enfin quelle est la cause de votre courroux?

Id: [0x0098A32D]
Ma fille! Ma seule et unique fille, que tu as déshonorée l'autre soir! Ne mens pas!

Id: [0x0098A32E]
Elle m'a tout avoué en sanglots!

Id: [0x0098A32F]
Je ne vous suis pas, madame...

Id: [0x0098A330]
Menteur!

Id: [0x0098A331]
De quelle fille parlez-vous?

Id: [0x0098A332]
D'Athénée! Blonde, belle comme coeur et bien trop naïve!

Id: [0x0098A333]
Tu vas réparer ta faute, en l'épousant prestement, dans les meilleurs délais. Sans quoi, je te fais jeter en prison pour atteinte aux bonnes moeurs!

Id: [0x0098A334]
Mais je ne connais nulle Athénée!

Id: [0x0098A335]
Tu aggraves ton cas!

Id: [0x0098A337]
Enfin je te trouve! Tu vas me rendre mon argent!

Id: [0x0098A338]
Non pas, je vous avais prévenue des risques.

Id: [0x0098A339]
Je suis ruinée!

Id: [0x0098A33A]
Il fallait réfléchir avant, vous avez eu le temps!

Id: [0x0098A33B]
La compagnie ne vaut plus rien depuis que le bateau a fait naufrage, je veux mon argent!

Id: [0x0098A33C]
Ou j'en appelle à la justice!

Id: [0x0098A33D]
Faites, le juge est de mes amis.

Id: [0x0098A33E]
Voleur!

Id: [0x0098A33F]
Modérez vos propos…

Id: [0x0098A340]
As-tu modéré les tiens en me promettant la fortune?

Id: [0x0098A341]
Si tu ne me rends pas ce que tu m'as volé, je ferai savoir à tout Paris quel escoffier tu es! Tu ne t'en sortiras pas comme ça, je le jure!

Id: [0x0098A342]
C'est mal me connaitre, madame.

Id: [0x0098A343]
Tu le regretteras, crois-moi!

Id: [0x0098A345]
A moi deux mots, marchand de malheur! Oui, vous là!

Id: [0x0098A346]
Ne m'approchez pas, ou il vous en cuira!

Id: [0x0098A347]
Escroc!

Id: [0x0098A348]
Si vous cherchez l'esclandre, vous allez la trouver.

Id: [0x0098A349]
La viande que vous m'avez vendue a empoisonné mes enfants, le petit est au plus mal!

Id: [0x0098A34A]
N'avez-vous aucune honte?

Id: [0x0098A34B]
Ma viande est-elle bien la cause?

Id: [0x0098A34C]
Assassin!

Id: [0x0098A34D]
Là c'en est trop...

Id: [0x0098A34E]
Trop? Mon petit a vomi toute la nuit et il dépérit!

Id: [0x0098A34F]
Les gens de votre espèce prospèrent sur la misère du petit peuple! Un jour prochain, vous paierez pour vos crimes, je le jure devant Dieu!

Id: [0x0098A350]
La douleur vous égare, croyez-bien...

Id: [0x0098A351]
Hors de ma vue!

Id: [0x0098A353]
I demand reparation!

Id: [0x0098A354]
Whatever for?

Id: [0x0098A355]
Do you deny that you assaulted me while you were in a drunken state two nights ago?

Id: [0x0098A356]
I don't remember two nights ago.

Id: [0x0098A357]
Your behaviour was boorish and rude!

Id: [0x0098A358]
It is you who are boorish and rude, sir!

Id: [0x0098A359]
I shall have you arrested for this insult!

Id: [0x0098A35B]
I know what you did!

Id: [0x0098A35C]
And what's that?

Id: [0x0098A35D]
You stole from the till!

Id: [0x0098A363]
Thought you'd evade me?

Id: [0x0098A364]
I don't hide from anyone.

Id: [0x0098A365]
You've been running around with my sister!

Id: [0x0098A366]
Don't even know your sister!

Id: [0x0098A367]
I saw you under the oak tree.

Id: [0x0098A368]
Oh, that sister.

Id: [0x0098A369]
If I catch you near her again, you'll regret it.

Id: [0x0098A36B]
I wish to speak with you!

Id: [0x0098A36C]
What do you want?

Id: [0x0098A36D]
Where were you two nights ago?

Id: [0x0098A36E]
In bed, sleeping.

Id: [0x0098A36F]
Was that before or after you threw stones through the grocer's windows? Did he charge you too much for carrots?

Id: [0x0098A370]
Yeah, for potatoes too!

Id: [0x0098A372]
I want a word!

Id: [0x0098A373]
Yes?

Id: [0x0098A374]
You're part of the London Bridge Gang.

Id: [0x0098A375]
Never heard such nonsense.

Id: [0x0098A376]
Admit it! I myself saw you stealing a carriage with your partners in crime. No one escapes me.

Id: [0x0098A377]
The lads will have me out in no time!

Id: [0x0098A379]
You there! You!

Id: [0x0098A37A]
What seems to be the problem?

Id: [0x0098A37B]
You are a criminal, sir.

Id: [0x0098A37C]
Whatever do you mean?

Id: [0x0098A37D]
I mean that we know all about your threatening letters to the queen. This is a very serious offense!

Id: [0x0098A37E]
They were written in jest! I never meant for them to be posted!

Id: [0x0098A391]
Where were you?

Id: [0x0098A392]
What are you in a bait about now?

Id: [0x0098A393]
I came home and there was no supper on the table!

Id: [0x0098A394]
You do know how to slice a loaf of bread, don't you?

Id: [0x0098A395]
Is that all there is to eat after a hard day's work? A measly loaf of bread. I should have married your sister!

Id: [0x0098A396]
She wouldn't have been foolish enough to marry you!

Id: [0x0098A397]
I was the one who was foolish!

Id: [0x0098A398]
You'll hear no argument from me!

Id: [0x0098A39A]
Oh, here we go again.

Id: [0x0098A39B]
I suppose you wish to scold me?

Id: [0x0098A39C]
I've told you I don't like the company you keep, Agatha!

Id: [0x0098A39D]
So you've said - countless times.

Id: [0x0098A39E]
That crowd is a bad influence on you. I've asked you to stay away from them yet you continue to defy me.

Id: [0x0098A39F]
You are my brother, not my husband and I shall continue to see whom I please.

Id: [0x0098A3A0]
Then there is nothing more to say.

Id: [0x0098A3A1]
I'll show you!

Id: [0x0098A3A3]
Have you been following me?

Id: [0x0098A3A4]
Where's that leg of lamb?

Id: [0x0098A3A5]
It's a rather interesting story. I was on my way to the butcher...

Id: [0x0098A3A6]
You gambled the money away, didn't you!

Id: [0x0098A3A7]
You're jumping too hastily to conclusions, my dear. no gambling involved. I bought some special beans.

Id: [0x0098A3A8]
My mother was right! You're a numbskull!

Id: [0x0098A3A9]
Is that so? Very well then!

Id: [0x0098A3AA]
I hope you choke on your beans!

Id: [0x0098A3BD]
There's the vision of loveliness I seek.

Id: [0x0098A3BE]
You would be perfect for my painting!

Dr. Elliotson? I haven't heard that name in a long while. He was a brilliant heart specialist, until he became obsessed with phrenology and mesmerism. It ruined his career.

Id: [0x013133D5]
You're late. Starrick is making his move. The Piece of Eden is somewhere inside Buckingham Palace.

Id: [0x013133D6]
Let him have it.

Id: [0x013133D7]
I've seen your handiwork across the city. Perhaps you should trust my judgement.

Id: [0x013133DA]
Don't you quote Father at me.

Id: [0x013133DB]
That's Plato! [beat]And I am sorry this doesn't involve anything you can destroy. Father was right, he never approved of your methods.

Id: [0x013133DC]
Father is dead!

Id: [0x013133DD]
Enough! I have just received word from my spies. At the palace ball tonight, Starrick plans to steal the Piece of Eden, and then eliminate all the heads of church and state.

Id: [0x013133DF]
Once more, for old time's sake?

Id: [0x013133E0]
And then we're finished.

Id: [0x013133E2]
Agreed. So what's the plan?

Id: [0x013133E8]
CINEMATIC - int. TRAIN HIDEOUT (BAR CAR)  - DAY

Id: [0x013133EA]
Such an unexpected delight to visit you both. What is the “news on the street”?

Id: [0x013133EB]
Mrs. Disraeli, we have discovered that there is something inside Buckingham Palace that could threaten the--

Id: [0x013133EC]
What my sister's failing to say, is that we require entrance into the ball tonight.

Id: [0x013133ED]
Impossible! Even if there were any invitation cards remaining, which there are not, someone of your lowly station...

Id: [0x013133EE]
If that damn fool Gladstone is attending this evening, they can have my card.

Id: [0x013133F0]
Mrs. Disraeli! If you would be kind enough to inform my darling brother of the location of the Gladstone's residence, perhaps he can use his considerable skill to commandeer their cards.

Id: [0x013133F1]
What fun! Did you hear that, Dizzy? We're going to "pinch" the Gladstones' invitations.

Id: [0x013133F2]
Thank you for volunteering me, sweet sister.

Id: [0x013133F3]
Oh, a pleasure, brother dearest. [beat]Now, Mrs. Disraeli, if you would excuse me, I must visit with the Maharajah. It occurs to me that he may have a second set of plans to a certain vault.

Id: [0x013133F9]
Please tell me again where we are going.

Id: [0x013133FA]
I found a letter from the Prince Consort among Lucy Thorne's research. Marked with the same insignia as your key. Dated 1847.

Id: [0x01313407]
My friend, the plans you asked for have been removed.

Id: [0x01313408]
Removed? By whom?

Id: [0x0131340F]
Get Miss Nightingale to look at that. I must find the vault before Starrick secures the shroud.

Id: [0x01313412]
Did they hurt you?

Id: [0x01313413]
Evie, they sent someone to move the architectural plans. Do you have them?

Id: [0x01313415]
When shall we meet in private?

Id: [0x01313416]
I am occupied 'til Thursday my Turtle Dove.

Id: [0x01313418]
Our favorite nook at Portland Place?

Id: [0x0131341E]
Your eyes shine as brightly as the stars.

Id: [0x0131341F]
Then I shall shut them on this new moon, leaving you with no light to see by.

Id: [0x01313420]
Hm, I must feel my way.

Id: [0x01313421]
Oh my! Irresistible. Depart before you are spotted, I will see you once more on Thursday.

Id: [0x01313422]
I will await the day sleepless, stumbling about in the dark, waiting for your light.

Id: [0x01313424]
Now for the invitations. What's this? “Swords must be left at the door by order of the Queen.” [beat]Freddy will know what to do.

Id: [0x01313426]
One should not attend the Queen's ball without making a proper entrance.

EXT. LONDON (back alley) - DAY

Id: [0x0131343B]
1847?

Id: [0x0131343C]
The same year the Prince began renovations to Buckingham Palace.

Id: [0x0131343D]
You think he added a vault for the Shroud!

Id: [0x0131343E]
And since there is no map of the palace with a room marked "secret vault"...

Id: [0x01313440]
Your Highness, may I present Miss Evie Frye. Miss Frye, Maharajah Duleep Singh.

Id: [0x01313449]
Crawford Starrick. Or someone employed by him. [off Henry and Evie's reactions:]Yes, I thought you might recognize the name. I know where they are, but it is heavily guarded.

Id: [0x0131344A]
That part will not be a problem.

Id: [0x0131344C]
I thought not.

Id: [0x0131344D]
We're going to need a plan.

Id: [0x0131344E]
I can provide a distraction for the guards while you find a safe way inside.

Id: [0x01313450]
Well... once I'm inside, I'll find someone who knows where the papers are stored...

Id: [0x01313452]
And we will meet back on the train.

Id: [0x01313459]
Be careful.

Id: [0x0131345E]
I don't know anything about that!

Id: [0x01313461]
int. covent garden (templar encampment)

Id: [0x01313473]
Pearl Attaway is Starrick's competitor, is she? Perhaps it's time I went into business.

It was Gladstone, I bet my life on it. This is perfectly in keeping with his distinct lack of character.

Id: [0x01313486]
Charmed. I think we'd better get you home.

Id: [0x01313489]
This reporter asked Mr. Malcolm Millner and the new owner of the company, Mr Crawford Starrick, to comment on these very serious allegations.

Id: [0x013134AB]
“It is my hope that this good news may please you. I await further instructions. I am, etc. etc., Rupert Ferris.” Send it to Mr. Starrick please, Mr. Stone.

Id: [0x013134AD]
And how is your father these days? I hope the doctor I sent has facilitated a speedy return to good health.

Id: [0x013134B1]
I ask you, m'lord, can't a gentl'man wander the tracks?

Get that man to interrogation, then I want him brought to the lab.

This dance is nearly over.

Evie, I'm coming. Don't die!

Now for the vault.

Jacob's most likely off stealing another carriage somewhere. Or accidentally pushing the Queen down a flight of stairs.

There you are! I have someone I'm simply dying for you to meet.

Id: [0x013135A4]
Uh--

Your Majesty, may I present Miss Evie Frye.

You are the one responsible for Mr. Gladstone's mishap?

Your Majesty, I apologize--

The cake is particularly good. Enjoy the ball.

He cut off her ring finger...so where is the ring?

Id: [0x02625A80]
I need to disperse the crowd and find a higher viewpoint if I am to decipher Jack's message.

Id: [0x02625A81]
Miss Evie! Thank god you're here.

Id: [0x02625A86]
I must be careful not to anger or harm any policemen, if I want to keep them on my side.

Id: [0x02625A89]
She'll be here any minute!

Id: [0x02625A8A]
Mr. Jack says we can have our way with her....

Id: [0x02625A8B]
Right. Look sharp, lads.

Id: [0x02625A8D]
I can throw the bomb from a safe distance and scare those thugs away.

Id: [0x02625A8E]
My fear bomb will have them scurry away like frightened mice, while I watch from the shadows.

Id: [0x02625A8F]
I'll throw this from a safe distance and watch the cowards flee..

Id: [0x02625A94]
No, please! Spare me, master Jack!

Id: [0x02625A97]
The banshee... She's in there...

Id: [0x02625A98]
That's her! Mr. Jack wants her dead!

Id: [0x02625A9B]
She's after Lady O! Stop her!

Id: [0x02625A9C]
Where do you think you're going little Miss?

You're not getting anywhere near our mistress!

Id: [0x02625B10]
I'll need to tackle Jack's influence over the gangs in London.

Id: [0x02625B11]
Jack's terror over the prostitutes in London has to end.

Id: [0x02625B13]
The press acts on Jack's orders. I'll have to purge it from his lieutenants.

Id: [0x02625B45]
Sorry Nellie, there's no saving you just yet.

Id: [0x02625B46]
Jack stroke again I've got to hurry.

Id: [0x02625B47]
I need to find a higher viewpoint if I am to decipher Jack's message.

Id: [0x02625B5A]
I’ll find her. I promise

Id: [0x02625B5B]
You’re safe now.

Id: [0x02625B5D]
Looks like Lady Owers thugs have taken over the place.

Id: [0x02625B5F]
You! Stop it now!

Id: [0x02625B60]
Let’s see how the people of London judge your acts

Id: [0x02625B61]
They’re everywhere! Stay quiet if you want to stay alive.

Id: [0x02625B6B]
Your highness, you belong to India, not here acting the part of the Noble Foreigner!

Id: [0x02625B6C]
I have wasted enough time indulging this nonsense.

Jacob Frye hunts the elusive killer to bring an end to the Terror of Jack the Ripper.

Id: [0x02626142]
In 1888, London is plunged into shadow and fear, by a series of gruesome and unsolvable murders.

Id: [0x02626143]
...where prostitutes are being mutilated, and left on grotesque display for the world to ogle...

Id: [0x02626172]
The Ripper fears no one.

I think I may faint. [laughs]

Id: [0x02626174]
Is that intended to scare me?

Id: [0x02626175]
You are boring me, Miss Frye.

Id: [0x02626176]
There is a sickness in this world, Miss Frye. It made our creed weak.

Id: [0x02626177]
But I am here now. I will tear into all sickness, all the rot and shit of this city and rip it out.

Id: [0x02626178]
We shall be pure again. The Assassins shall rise and we shall rule.

Id: [0x02626179]
This is my time now. Jacob's is done and you must choose...

Id: [0x0262617A]
The people must fear us, and you know it!

Do you see the truth your brother did not? Are we not the same you and I?

Id: [0x0262617D]
Mine is the face of the true Creed! Will you join me? Or must I rip out your vitals and send them to your beloved inspector.

Id: [0x0262617E]
See, Jacob! Your noble sister has come to die for you!

Id: [0x0262617F]
I will cut her like the others and display her innards for the world to see! For you, Jacob!

Id: [0x02626180]
I will lay you twins together in death...it will be my grandest work to date!

Id: [0x02626181]
Your sister will be the last victim of your pathetic Creed. Do you hear me, Jacob!

Id: [0x02626182]
Evie will fall, and be forgotten--just like you and your obsolete Creed!

Id: [0x02626183]
I'll rip out her vitals and lay them in your lap, for you to take the blame Jacob!

Still think you can hide from me?

Jacob thought he could hide from me too...

Id: [0x02626188]
Come out, Sister, join Jack...

Well let's just say, it's not JUST the B. I. C. And Singh doesn't want any part of it.

A couple years ago, they held his mother captive and blocked all his letters from reaching her. Odds are they're keeping his correspondence from reaching the outside world once again.

Id: [0x0262627D]
I have acquired the mail courier's schedule. There are two separate routes of transport. The first, a mail carriage. If we set up an ambush, you should be able to seize his letters.

Id: [0x0262627E]
It's a long shot, but if you find something, we may be able to convince him that it's time to take action. We have no time to waste.

I have, but you may want some Rooks by your side, regardless. When you’re finished, meet me back at my shop. I shall invite Mister Singh over for a spot of tea.

Why are we going to such lengths to keep these letter hidden?

It has come to my attention that the British Indies Company has stolen a large sum of wealth from the good people of Punjab. It is my intention to send it back.

Id: [0x02626347]
And where is this gold located?

Id: [0x02626349]
All I’ve managed to find out is that the B. I. C. have their very own accountant. Perhaps he will have more information about this.

Shall we? We must track them down quickly.

Id: [0x026263F1]
The documents you found state that they're hiding a shipment of gold, previously stolen from India, in a carriage at an old Starrick Warehouse. So that is where we must go.

Id: [0x026263F2]
We must find this carriage and steal it from them.

Why, I'm here to help you of course! They don't call me the fourth best shot in London for nothing!

Id: [0x026263F5]
This is it, the gold is here somewhere. Return to me once you've found it, and I'll keep an eye out for trouble from here. Be careful. What they think is theirs they won't easily part with.

It's all quite strange: the British Indies Company working with the Templar Order. And for what? Perhaps we will never know.

Sir! The bomb shipments! They’ve been destroyed!

Id: [0x026266EC]
Is that Ellsworth? I better get a closer look.

Id: [0x026266EE]
Is that Brinley Ellsworth? It can’t be. I need to get a better look.

Id: [0x026266F4]
Destroyed? How?

Id: [0x026266F5]
There’s someone in the vicinity! A spy! One of those Rooks, I wager.

Id: [0x026266F6]
It must be those damned renegades Singh is friends with. Who knew one caged bird could cause so much trouble.

Id: [0x026266F9]
You’re caught, Ellsworth. Give up.

Id: [0x026266FA]
I knew you had something to do with this! Seize him!

Id: [0x026266FC]
You have been unmasked Ellsworth. Give up.

What did you find out? Who is behind all this.

Id: [0x02626707]
You are not going to like what I have to tell you, your Highness. Brinley Ellsworth is behind the attacks.

Id: [0x02626709]
You are not going to like what I have to tell you, your Highness. Brinley Ellsworth is behind the attacks.

Id: [0x0262670B]
Ellsworth...

Id: [0x0262670E]
He was gone before I had the chance to follow him... But we need to track him down and put an end to this before anything worse happens.

Id: [0x02626710]
He rushed off before I could catch up to him... I’m sorry, but we need to find him before he puts your life at more risk than he already has.

Id: [0x02626712]
I need some time to think on this.

Oh good, you’re here. His Highness seems to caught a mild case of madness this morning.

Id: [0x02626718]
You were right when you said that this is our chance.

Id: [0x0262671B]
I was?

Id: [0x0262671D]
What’s the plan?

Id: [0x0262671F]
I propose we make a commotion, lure out the Templar controlled-British Indies Company.

Id: [0x02626722]
And do what? Put yourself in the line of fire?

Id: [0x02626724]
What good will that do?

Id: [0x02626727]
I need to send Ellsworth a message. This won’t be over until we can draw him out. You know you’re welcome to join me. This is something I must do.

Id: [0x02626728]
Duleep leaves.

Id: [0x02626729]
He’s very capable, but I do worry about him sometimes.

Id: [0x0262672C]
Thanks, Greenie. I’ll be back.

Thank you, Henry.

Id: [0x0262673B]
Anything!

Id: [0x0262673C]
Tell him to meet me at Lambeth cemetery tonight. And tell him to come alone.

Id: [0x02626740]
You there! Halt!

Id: [0x02626741]
We need to split up. I’ll distract the police, you get yourself out of here.

Id: [0x02626742]
Meet me tonight at Lambeth cemetery. He won’t come alone, even if I ask him to.

int. train hideout

Id: [0x02626747]
That caused quite a commotion…

Id: [0x02626748]
He’s gone mad! Greenie was right!

Id: [0x02626749]
He isn’t mad, Jacob. He’s trying to take action, do the right thing… Oh never mind. I’ll take it from here.

He thinks you’ve gone mad.

Id: [0x02626753]
I probably have.

Id: [0x02626754]
What’s your plan.

Id: [0x02626755]
I’ve asked Brinley to meet me here alone. In turn, he of course has sent a small army here to secure the area. I need you to get rid of them and meet me back here. It’s essential that when Brinley does arrive, I have him to myself.

Id: [0x02626756]
Understood.

Id: [0x02626758]
ext. lambeth cemetery

Id: [0x0262675A]
That will certainly help quite a bit, thank you.

Id: [0x0262675C]
He’s here.

Id: [0x0262675D]
I must talk to him.

Id: [0x0262675E]
Don’t be silly. This is dangerous.

Id: [0x0262675F]
Miss Frye, this is something I must do, and I must do it alone. Remain here. Something terrible could happen were he to see you.

Id: [0x02626762]
ext. lambeth cemetery

Id: [0x02626765]
You can’t escape me forever, your Highness. Come out and face me.

Id: [0x02626766]
I told you to meet me here alone.

Id: [0x02626767]
I am not as silly as I once was, Singh. I wouldn’t dare come to this meeting place alone. Not with your recently acquired friends by your side.

Id: [0x02626768]
But I am alone.

Id: [0x0262676A]
It doesn’t have to be like this.

Id: [0x0262676B]
You think you can just walk about this Earth like a free man? You are anything but. You have always been a trophy of war and will always be a trophy of war. You have caused quite enough commotion already and it’s time to put an end to that.

Id: [0x0262676C]
If you kill me now, you will be a wanted man. I have more value than you think. Imagine the uprising when they find out the only son of Ranjit Singh is dead.

Id: [0x0262676D]
You believe they remember you? You are nothing more than a lost soul, a monarch who has done nothing but abandon his people. You are nothing.

Id: [0x0262676E]
We were such good friends-

Id: [0x0262676F]
Friends? You were no more than a play-thing. A prisoner in prince’s clothing. You’re lucky to be alive. I admit, I’m surprised they let you live.

You have done me much good. I am heavily indebted to you both.

We are happy to help.

Id: [0x02626779]
I fear that I cannot continue this way of handling things. The Assassin way is not my way, as helpful as you have been.

Id: [0x0262677A]
This Empire, this land, my people… The problem is so much bigger than death. I know now I must devote my life to this cause, to put India, my home, back onto the map, return it to it’s people. It’s a long and grueling journey, but it is something I must do. Even if it takes me to my own death.

Id: [0x0262677B]
We understand, your highness.

Id: [0x0262677C]
But, if you do change your mind, you know where to find us.

Id: [0x0262677D]
That I do. Thank you, Assassins. Hopefully we never shall meet again.

You could say that!

Id: [0x026268DF]
But at least that quieted them down... For now.

Id: [0x026268E1]
That should keep them quiet for a while.

Id: [0x026268E3]
Perhaps this is not the best time to bring up what I called you here for but... I have another plan.

Id: [0x026268E6]
Go on, then.

Id: [0x026268E8]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x026268EA]
It may sound mad but... I propose we steal the Koh-I-Noor diamond.

Id: [0x026268ED]
Doesn't that belong to the Queen?

Id: [0x026268EF]
A piece of the Royal Jewels? Whatever for?

Id: [0x026268F1]
Her majesty may wear it, but it doesn't belong to her. It was a trophy, symbolizing the colonization of India and it deserves to be returned home. It would be an extremely delicate mission. But I know you'd be more than capable of such a feat.

Id: [0x026268F2]
I have already procured some information pertaining to the location of the Koh-I-Noor. Come and find me when you’ve had a moment to think it over.

Excellent. Heists are m favourite.

Id: [0x026268FD]
A man by the name of Cornelius Toti-Button-

Id: [0x026268FE]
he gets a glower from Evie. Beer-drinker… What? I can tell.

Id: [0x026268FF]
He is apparently a friend of the Royal Jeweller.

Id: [0x02626900]
How will we find him?

Id: [0x02626901]
He frequents a pub in the City of London borough called the Sleeping Giant.

Sounds like the sort of man I know how to deal with.

Whatever it is you want from me, I’m not interested. What I AM interested in is ordering another pint.

Id: [0x0262690F]
I’ll tell you what: if I can out-drink you, you tell me where the famous Koh-I-Noor diamond is located.

Id: [0x02626910]
Ha! You think you can drink me under the table? That’s a lot to wager on a losing battle.

Fair enough, I am caught red-handed. The man’s a real tit, though. He had it coming. Keep quiet about this, will you? Here’s some incentive. There’s a good chap.

Alright, alright. It’s in the Tower of London, surprise. It’s being held there until tonight’s gala finishes and then it will be shipped back to the Royal Jeweller for another cutting.

Jacob, you can escort Mister Singh to tonight’s event. This will give you a chance to slip away from the party and find the Koh-I-Noor. I will take care of the guards around the perimeter. Meet me at the top of the White Tower.

Mister Singh and I were quite close, your ladyship. It was a lonely time on foreign soil for me. I was more than happy to have a friend.

Id: [0x026269D7]
I’m sure. And now the Company has sent you here on urgent business.

Id: [0x026269D8]
I wish I could disclose the information, your ladyship. But alas, I cannot. I’m sure you will know of it soon enough.

Id: [0x026269E7]
What took you so long?

Id: [0x026269E8]
Bit of a mishap.

Id: [0x026269E9]
The diamond?

Id: [0x026269EA]
I’ve got it, but just barely.

Id: [0x026269EB]
What happened?

Id: [0x026269EC]
Somebody stole it first. The vault had been robbed by the time I got there.

Id: [0x026269ED]
The British Indies Company won't stop at anything.

Id: [0x026269EF]
There was a plan to frame Singh. Had run my hands through his pockets before the royal guards found it on him. Imagine the look on her Majesty's face if-

Id: [0x026269F0]
They must know by now that their plan was foiled.

Id: [0x026269F1]
You're welcome.

Id: [0x026269F2]
I think it's time to depart.

Now to find Duleep and get him out of here.

Id: [0x026269FE]
int. TOWER OF LONDON

Id: [0x02626A01]
You, sir. Halt for inspection.

Id: [0x02626A02]
I beg your pardon.

Id: [0x02626A03]
Search him.

Id: [0x02626A05]
We found nothing. The Koh-I-Noor isn’t here.

Id: [0x02626A06]
Well of course you found nothing! What do you take me for, some sort of criminal? Unhand me.

Id: [0x02626A09]
EXt. TOWER OF LONDON

Id: [0x02626A0B]
What was all that commotion about, Mister Singh?

Id: [0x02626A0C]
I do believe they thought I was trying to pinch the Koh-I-Noor, your ladyship.

Id: [0x02626A0D]
Ha! The Koh-I-Noor! Who on earth would want to steal that? It’s as ugly as a potato... Goodnight, your highness.

Id: [0x02626A0F]
We barely got out of there in one piece. The British Indies Company tried to plant the diamond on you and frame you for stealing it. [grinning] Luckily, I was there just in the nick of time.

Id: [0x02626A10]
We need to meet back at Mister Green’s shop. I need to see the diamond with my own two eyes.

Id: [0x02626A12]
I hope they make it out all right.

I have come upon these ancient timbers, tarred for preservation, to mark my sacred symbol and pinpoint the source of their power.<LF><LF>As I pray, the Lord sends through me the voice of a Holy Spirit. It reverberates with the finery of ancient language, and I am made anew.<LF><LF>Were these timbers carried by the Nephilim? Barriers against invasions from afar? Please Lord, let this truth shineth upon me as bright as your Word doth.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C61]
Again I find traces of the Nephilim. By edict of the local king, I shall prayeth to Him, that this light may be known as Holy.<LF><LF>These luminous placards are the divining rods of Him who speaks to me. With effort, I seek the union of all His holy creations.<LF><LF>Aita, Juno, Minerva, names that enter my head. Are these the Nephilim He reveals to me? Are these stones their signposts? I pray for your guidance, Lord. Amen.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C62]
I am proud the Lord speaks so cleanly through my soul here in Wreocensaete. He talks of his instruments and asks that I be one.<LF><LF>It appears the Nephilim were at battle here long ago. Against a great tempest, some few protected us. We must honor these ancient paths.<LF><LF>I have explained what He left for us here to the Wreckin-Dwellers nearby. Blessed be all those who tread in this Holy light.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C63]
The kingdoms of Bernicia and Elmet have granted me the right to worship here, by edict of Eoppa of Bernicia.<LF><LF>The Nephilim were the only race with the strength to have moved such pillars with the power of the Lord behind them.<LF><LF>But what were they guarding against? Did you command them, Lord? Was it for the sin of people of other times? Was it to keep the demons out?<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C64]
I shall inform the local Wuffingas that He lives among them, through traces of the Nephilim, the giant warriors who fought for God in their ancient times.<LF><LF>They hath left his presence here on earth for us to absorb His light. The light of Angels that hath been infused throughout the earth.<LF><LF>I feel His Power. He calls me My Beloved and I am calmed. I respondeth with my communion, my piety, and become another of His voices.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C65]
Here lieth still more remnants of the Nephilim. I have marked a symbol upon the stones, that future folk may imbue their spirit with the energy within.<LF><LF>For those who wish to seek communion with the Lord here, be wary. For He Speaks through ciphers, and His words are woven with ancient fibers.<LF><LF>He is manifest here. He hath made importance of these pillars, brought by the giants of yore, now guarding us, as only He knows. Amen.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C66]
Here, I believe, is where the Nephilim placed sacred stones to guard the chattel of God from other giants.<LF><LF>Those present were scared by demons, and God defended the pious, sending the giants away. Only these Holy reverberations remain.<LF><LF>The work of Good Souls who have the earth in their heart will forever be tied to our ancestors and our Lord via this gateway.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C67]
I spoke with Him again. He said that he pined, and I feel torn in two: my loyalty to Him tears me one direction and the Nephilim point elsewhere.<LF><LF>Why hath these voices spoken to me? The gospels sing within me, and yet I sense conflict. I sense disagreement among the angels. It saddens me greatly.<LF><LF>I will, one day, weigh my soul, attempt penance, attempt to repent for the missteps in my life. Yet here all shineth brightest, for He let me see.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C68]
Welcome fair traveler, curious Child of His. I am Brendan of Ireland, and through Light and Voice have these stones spoken to me.<LF><LF>Here lies the markings of Him, where a second voice, Higher than most, spoke to me again. Listen to all I have learned through prayer.<LF><LF>Long ago was a Great and Tragic War. The offspring of Gods who lived before the Deluge. I pray for these Rebel Angels who came before.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Id: [0x00283C69]
This is a different site. One resplendent in a manner unto itself. Where His light shines greatest. Today, I was warned of a harrowing depth.<LF><LF>After the Nephilim, great battles were fought in resurrective Kingdoms of Christ. Many were lost in the fight, many more in the cataclysm that followed.<LF><LF>Today, my Lord instructed me in plain words to travel o'er the ocean and seek the door behind which hides his fallen angel. I shall try, in His name. Amen.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

To My Sister Heregyth of Lindsey<LF><LF>In 873, the year of our Lord, we were forced from our home by the rabid Spaldingas. We take refuge in the peat swamps of the Fens.<LF><LF>God has dropped from the heavens a key to this home where we spent many a night reading the vulgates and spreading the goodwill of our Lord. And as our Lord Jesus Christ caught a fish in a mesh of goodwill for the salvation of all, so too have I caught this key and placed it nearer the heavens than you now stand. Let this key be your salvation as well.<LF><LF>Godspeed. May we see each other again.<LF><LF>Heahburh of Lindsey

By what right do you command?

Id: [0x0028D711]
You have no power

Id: [0x0028D72C]
We're here for an alliance.

Id: [0x0028D72D]
People are scared.

Id: [0x0028D72E]
How many bodies?

Id: [0x0028D72F]
You're dreaming.

Id: [0x0028D730]
It is nothing but a stone.

Id: [0x0028D731]
Your lead?

Id: [0x0028D759]
She works for a smith?

Id: [0x0028D75A]
When did she go missing?

Id: [0x0028D75B]
What's her name?

Id: [0x0028D77F]
I'm the one asking questions.

Id: [0x0028D780]
I'm a friend.

Id: [0x0028D781]
I'm a member of The Order.

Id: [0x0028D992]
The Mari Lwyd has come to scare.

Id: [0x0028D993]
A horse's skull with terrible hair.

Id: [0x0028D9B7]
To each dwelling, fate foretelling, it's the Mari Lwyd.

Id: [0x0028D9B8]
Never knowing who is knocking, wanting something good.

Id: [0x0028DACE]
Halfdan knows.

Id: [0x0028DACF]
Halfdan does not know.

Id: [0x0028DB2B]
He might have survived the fall.

Id: [0x0028DB2C]
No one could survive that fall.

Id: [0x0028DCB6]
Why kill Tewdwr?

Id: [0x0028DCB8]
A dead man can't pay.

Id: [0x0028DCB9]
You're lying.

Id: [0x0028DCE2]
I'll kill him.

Id: [0x0028DCE3]
I'll expose him.

Id: [0x0028DCF1]
I have to go.

Id: [0x0028E10B]
Is that Tryggr's body?

Id: [0x0028E10C]
Were the killers after you?

Id: [0x0028E10D]
You must be Erke.

Id: [0x0028E65E]
I want to ask you some questions about…

Id: [0x0028E65F]
Someone betrayed Soma.

Id: [0x0028E660]
I should be going.

Id: [0x0028E662]
You told me you don't think Soma is a good leader.

Id: [0x0028E663]
Your yellow paint was stolen.

Id: [0x0028E664]
Were you jealous that Guthrum chose Soma to lead?

Id: [0x0028E665]
Do you know this letter about a yellow longship?

Id: [0x0028E67D]
Improving the Settlement

Id: [0x0028E67E]
Sufficient <img src='cargo_common' /> supplies and <img src='cargo_rare' /> raw materials to construct buildings in the settlement.

Id: [0x0028E6A2]
You love Soma.

Id: [0x0028E6A3]
You used to be a smuggler.

Id: [0x0028E6A4]
It looked like you were planning to leave.

Id: [0x0028E6A5]
Have you seen this letter about a yellow longship?

Id: [0x0028E84C]
Are you with the giants?

Id: [0x0028E84D]
What can you offer?

Id: [0x0028E84E]
Why are you here?

Id: [0x0028E87C]
Your arrival is suspicious.

Id: [0x0028E87D]
Walls have failed us.

Id: [0x0028E87E]
What is your price?

Id: [0x0028E989]
You and Modron?

Id: [0x00291CED]
I want to ask you some questions about…

Id: [0x00291CEE]
Someone betrayed Soma.

Id: [0x00291CEF]
I should be going.

Id: [0x00291CF0]
What does your vision about Soma mean?

Id: [0x00291CF1]
Why were you wandering on the brink of death?

Id: [0x00291CF2]
Why was your longship painted yellow?

Id: [0x00291CF3]
Do you know this letter about a yellow longship?

Id: [0x00294C43]
I found your paint bucket.

Id: [0x00294CEB]
Hussa of Lundenwic.

Id: [0x00294CEC]
Egbert of East Anglia.

Id: [0x00294CED]
Stowe of Lunden.

Id: [0x00294D3D]
Tell me what you saw.

Id: [0x00294D3E]
Hardship has clouded your thoughts.

Id: [0x00294D3F]
We've traveled far on trust.

Id: [0x00294D67]
You need to move on.

Id: [0x002951FB]
PILLAGE AREA

Id: [0x002A10AA]
You suspect him?

Id: [0x002A10B4]
I like Erke.

Id: [0x002A10B5]
I don't know him.

Id: [0x002A1114]
It's good to talk.

Id: [0x002A1115]
People can let you down.

Id: [0x002A1116]
I'll grab one of those coins.

Id: [0x002A3F34]
About time.

Id: [0x002A3F35]
Be careful.

Id: [0x002A3F36]
Something's brewing outside.

Id: [0x002A3F61]
I will wait.

Id: [0x002A3F7A]
How can I wake him?

Id: [0x002A3F88]
Enhance gear

Id: [0x002A3F89]
Change appearance

Id: [0x002A3FB0]
Let's go over the facts.

Id: [0x002A3FB2]
I need more time.

Id: [0x002A3FB3]
What do we know about The Compass?

Id: [0x002A400C]
I'll pay.

Id: [0x002A400D]
Soldiers won't help you.

Id: [0x002A400E]
I know you're an honest woman.

Id: [0x002A405B]
Faravid is planning an attack.

Id: [0x002A405C]
Faravid is honorable.

Id: [0x002A42EE]
Are you prepared to fight?

Id: [0x002A42EF]
I will give you silver.

Id: [0x002A42F0]
Consider your position.

Id: [0x002A477C]
Cost

Id: [0x002A47A2]
Never compromise The Order.

Id: [0x002A47A3]
The Order is Eternal.

Id: [0x002A47A4]
Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x002A483F]
I gave you my word.

Id: [0x002A4840]
I came to feast.

Id: [0x002A4841]
You look good, Oswald.

Id: [0x002A493B]
Are you certain The Seax is dead?

Id: [0x002A493C]
My reward will ease my hurt.

Id: [0x002A493D]
Where is Aelfred now?

Id: [0x002A497A]
Enough lies. Lives are in danger.

Id: [0x002A4AEB]
Ceolwulf is a good man.

Id: [0x002A4AEC]
I can see why you despise him.

Id: [0x002A4AF5]
I'm not here to talk about Ceolwulf.

Id: [0x002A4B34]
I want to practice.

Id: [0x002A4B35]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x002A4B36]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002A4B37]
I'll pay.

Id: [0x002A4B3B]
Give me another shot.

Id: [0x002A4B3C]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002A4D04]
Tell me about Wigmund.

Id: [0x002A4D10]
I am.

Id: [0x002A4D11]
I speak for him.

Id: [0x002A5652]
Here are the facts.

Id: [0x002A5653]
I've known your plight.

Id: [0x002A5654]
I have no right to ask for help.

Id: [0x002A5836]
Jorvik

Id: [0x002A58FE]
I value my queen.

Id: [0x002A5907]
No need for concern.

Id: [0x002A5908]
There will be no marriage.

Id: [0x002A591E]
The king owns the crown.

Id: [0x002A5922]
You stole your son's future.

Id: [0x002A5923]
What has become of you?

Id: [0x002A5A3C]
You've been ill used.

Id: [0x002A5A3E]
My actions are justified.

Id: [0x002A5A41]
The outcome is unwritten.

Id: [0x002A5A42]
Rune Equipped

Id: [0x002A5A43]
This rune is currently equipped in {0}. Do you still want to assign it?

Id: [0x002A5B61]
Upgrade to Quality {0} to unlock

Id: [0x002A5B62]
ASSIGN RUNE

Id: [0x002A5BC1]
It looks great here.

Id: [0x002A5BC2]
Not even a hint of blood.

Id: [0x002A5E00]
Who are these people?

Id: [0x002A5FA2]
Wait for my signal.

Id: [0x002A5FA3]
Unleash your war dogs!

Id: [0x002A607D]
Springalds with Stowe.

Id: [0x002A607F]
Flanking with Erke.

Id: [0x002A61BC]
What's the deal with you and Ubba?

Id: [0x002A61BE]
Ease off him.

Id: [0x002A61BF]
I'm not about to pick sides.

Id: [0x002A61CB]
I'll go alone.

Id: [0x002A6394]
You want to lay with me?

Id: [0x002A6395]
I am not interested.

Id: [0x002A6396]
Have another mead, friend.

Id: [0x002A6397]
I shall remember too, Broder.

Id: [0x002A6398]
I shall remember too, Brothir.

Id: [0x002A66EA]
May you find peace.

Id: [0x002A6767]
You lack courage.

Id: [0x002A6768]
You didn't trust us.

Id: [0x002A693E]
Will dwarves survive Ragnarok?

Id: [0x002A6983]
Buy

Id: [0x002A6984]
Sell

Id: [0x002A6985]
Owned

Id: [0x002A69B9]
You're grieving, I understand.

Id: [0x002A69BA]
Pull yourself together.

Id: [0x002A69BB]
Let's have a drink together.

Id: [0x002A69E1]
…to your father.

Id: [0x002A69E2]
…to you, Hunwald.

Id: [0x002A69E3]
…to Lincolnscire.

Id: [0x002A6D06]
Sigurd, wait…

Id: [0x002A6D07]
(Let him go)

Id: [0x002A6E30]
I saw through Odin's eyes.

Id: [0x002A6E31]
I consorted with Loki.

Id: [0x002A6E32]
I feared the start of Ragnarok.

Id: [0x002A6E33]
I can't say anything more.

Id: [0x002A6F43]
Hemming always had a steady heart.

Id: [0x002A6F44]
Hemming's heart is stopped now.

Id: [0x002A6F45]
Who are you to Hemming?

Id: [0x002A7332]
Trade with my clan.

Id: [0x002A7333]
Sounds like a problem.

Id: [0x002A734F]
You're quite a wealthy man, then.

Id: [0x002A7350]
It's more a lake, I'd say.

Id: [0x002A7351]
You said you had something to show me?

Id: [0x002A746C]
I'll take you on.

Id: [0x002A746D]
I don't have time for you.

Id: [0x002A746F]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002A7471]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002A7473]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002A7474]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002A7475]
I imagine your record's as false as your pride.

Id: [0x002A7476]
Prepare to taste bitter defeat, once our battle is done.

Id: [0x002A7477]
O, to beat such a braggart will surely be fun.

Id: [0x002A7478]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002A747A]
You're a weakling, a milksop, a cadger, a louse.

Id: [0x002A747B]
You're a snipe and a halfwit, a cretin, a clod.

Id: [0x002A747C]
You're no better than a rat that I would evict from my house.

Id: [0x002A747D]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002A747F]
You're the weakest of wordsmiths, a terrible bore.

Id: [0x002A7480]
Your pride is appalling, and your rhyming is worse.

Id: [0x002A7481]
Did you bet on yourself? Then know that I will empty your purse.

Id: [0x002A7482]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002A7484]
Let's do it again.

Id: [0x002A7485]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002A797D]
They will be grateful.

Id: [0x002A797E]
What matters is how you lead going forward.

Id: [0x002A79FD]
But your rhythm is clumsy, you'll never outpace me.

Id: [0x002A79FE]
It's the weakest attempt I've yet heard to disgrace me.

Id: [0x002A79FF]
See, your rhythm's how a fool would attempt to debase me.

Id: [0x002A7A0E]
All my life I've not heard of a flyting so flat.

Id: [0x002A7A0F]
Says the flyter who hides in a hole like a rat.

Id: [0x002A7A10]
There has never been so weak an insult as that.

Id: [0x002A7A12]
I do not think you will best me.

Id: [0x002A7A13]
You're not a talented flyter, Fergal.

Id: [0x002A7A14]
You can stop now, we're done.

Id: [0x002A7AB8]
I am no traitor.

Id: [0x002A7AB9]
Enough treason talk.

Id: [0x002A7ABA]
How dare you, Faravid?

Id: [0x002A7ABB]
Calm down, everyone.

Id: [0x002A7B6A]
Rued will die.

Id: [0x002A7B6B]
Rued will live.

Id: [0x002A7C9B]
I'll happily challenge him.

Id: [0x002A7C9C]
No. This is very strange.

Id: [0x002A7C9D]
I will.

Id: [0x002A7C9E]
Nevermind.

Id: [0x002A7CA0]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002A7CA2]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002A7CA4]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002A7CA5]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002A7CA6]
If this is your best, I've got nothing to fear.

Id: [0x002A7CA7]
Though you speak through another, your writing's still poor.

Id: [0x002A7CA8]
You're afflicted with terrible arrogance, but perhaps I am the cure?

Id: [0x002A7CA9]
Show me that again?

Id: [0x002A7CAB]
I'm devoted to winning, or haven't you heard?

Id: [0x002A7CAC]
Though you choose to be quiet, your folly is loud.

Id: [0x002A7CAD]
You're a simpleton and a fool, and you should never be proud.

Id: [0x002A7CAE]
Show me again?

Id: [0x002A7CB0]
I will easily crush you beneath my thumb.

Id: [0x002A7CB1]
With such drivel to speak, I see why you keep mum.

Id: [0x002A7CB2]
You're a waste of good quiet, go choke on your pen.

Id: [0x002A7CB3]
Once more, please?

Id: [0x002A7D04]
I do.

Id: [0x002A7D05]
Not now.

Id: [0x002A7D06]
This time I will not fail.

Id: [0x002A7D07]
No. Not now.

Id: [0x002A7D09]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002A7D0B]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002A7D0D]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002A7D0E]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002A7D0F]
You're speaking much more than you should.

Id: [0x002A7D10]
And it's more than the country can stand.

Id: [0x002A7D11]
For they put all who hear them to sleep.

Id: [0x002A7D12]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002A7D14]
Well, I think you'll be easily dispatched.

Id: [0x002A7D15]
I'll defeat you and banish all doubt.

Id: [0x002A7D16]
In the great art of flyting, I'm blessed.

Id: [0x002A7D17]
Please repeat that?

Id: [0x002A7D19]
Lend a salve, for your words make me ill.

Id: [0x002A7D1A]
You're exhausting, your words are but slop.

Id: [0x002A7D1B]
I think it's past time that I left.

Id: [0x002A7D1C]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002A7D69]
I'll take you on, squirrel!

Id: [0x002A7D6A]
Not now.

Id: [0x002A7D6B]
This time, I'm ready.

Id: [0x002A7D6C]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002A7D74]
As a warrior born, I'm unafraid to die.

Id: [0x002A7D75]
I should like to see you try.

Id: [0x002A7D76]
I will stomp you like a rat.

Id: [0x002A7D77]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002A7D79]
They're too dull to conquer me.

Id: [0x002A7D7A]
I'll best you at flyting, I swear you'll see.

Id: [0x002A7D7B]
I'll beat you here with ease!

Id: [0x002A7D7C]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002A7D7E]
I grow weary of your squeak.

Id: [0x002A7D7F]
And you're just a noisy mouse.

Id: [0x002A7D80]
I'm not the sorry victim you seek.

Id: [0x002A7D81]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002A7E14]
I accept.

Id: [0x002A7E15]
Not now.

Id: [0x002A7E16]
I will.

Id: [0x002A7E17]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002A7E19]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002A7E1B]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002A7E1D]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002A7E1E]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002A7E1F]
To wear blood is a joy, I'm quite striking in red.

Id: [0x002A7E20]
Well, perhaps they should have known not to challenge me then.

Id: [0x002A7E21]
Nay, one thousand's a pittance, it's closer to ten.

Id: [0x002A7E22]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002A7E24]
Yes, I am ridding the world of cowards, weaklings, and knaves.

Id: [0x002A7E25]
My reward is the battle, I'm pleased for it all.

Id: [0x002A7E26]
It is not mine to judge, only fill up the graves.

Id: [0x002A7E27]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002A7E29]
To ensure that I'll sit in Valhalla one day.

Id: [0x002A7E2A]
You're naive if you think that there's any other way.

Id: [0x002A7E2B]
This is my life, my choices, my legend, my lore.

Id: [0x002A7E2C]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002A7EC8]
I'm ready to duel.

Id: [0x002A7EC9]
I won't entertain you this day.

Id: [0x002A7ECA]
I am ready.

Id: [0x002A7ECB]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002A7ECD]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002A7ECF]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002A7ED1]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002A7ED2]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002A7ED3]
And I'm a great fighter, my strength knows no bounds.

Id: [0x002A7ED4]
You look more like a coward, you're trembling, weak and waxen.

Id: [0x002A7ED5]
And your thick little skull's fit for grinding my axe on.

Id: [0x002A7ED6]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002A7ED8]
You're not much of a man, but you're a brave little shrew.

Id: [0x002A7ED9]
If you had any wisdom, you would fear my strength.

Notes on Sigurd's Progress

Id: [0x002A9E0D]
-Isolation. I begin with sensory deprivation. No light, no touch, no warmth, no voices. To unlock the god within, the man called Sigurd must retreat into the shadows. His true self may emerge in time.<LF><LF>-Water and bread. That is all I have allowed this beautiful man. He is something to behold. When he curses my name, I feel the power in his voice. When he struggles against his bonds, I hear the squeal of the leather straps and the grind of iron on iron. He has fight in him. But to win this war against himself, he must relent.<LF><LF>- Sigurd does not yet accept that I have his best interests in mind. That I have taken him so that he may become his best self. He fights this idea, balks at it. And yet, I note a certain hesitation in his voice when he speaks. He talks as if a man being talked over, as if voices interrupt the river of his thoughts. It is working.<LF><LF>-Blood flows slowly from the forearms. A few small cuts produce a steady but manageable stream.<LF><LF>-Weeks upon weeks, and very little progress. Sigurd has lost weight and physical strength, but his will is strong. And though he is beset by visions, he has not allowed them to take him over.

A phrase he screamed as the vice tightened around his head - "I am the Lord of Justice! You will answer to me or die!" This puts me on a better path. I know what I must do.

You're a fool, and a braggart, and simply obtuse.

Id: [0x002AA22A]
Yes, with words I'll ensnare you and put you to bed.

Id: [0x002AA22B]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002AA22D]
I'm as good with my lips as I am with my tongue.

Id: [0x002AA22E]
I'm the greatest of lovers, and flyters as well.

Id: [0x002AA22F]
By your words, good sir, I am far from stung.

Id: [0x002AA230]
I'd like to hear that again, please.

Id: [0x002AA232]
While I doubt you can take me, I'll give you a go.

Id: [0x002AA233]
You are not so appealing, and thus I say no.

Id: [0x002AA234]
While I fill you with lust, sir, you fill me with fear.

Id: [0x002AA235]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002AA2DF]
You might be surprised. Let's duel.

Id: [0x002AA2E0]
I have nothing to prove to you.

Id: [0x002AA2E1]
Let me show you my true talent.

Id: [0x002AA2E2]
Never mind.

Id: [0x002AA2E4]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002AA2E6]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002AA2E8]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002AA2E9]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002AA2EA]
Then you're speaking to fools, and their knowledge is flawed.

Id: [0x002AA2EB]
If they know me, then that means my legend has grown

Id: [0x002AA2EC]
You're speaking about me? That's a little odd.

Id: [0x002AA2ED]
Could you repeat that?

Id: [0x002AA2EF]
Whoever would say that certainly isn't right.

Id: [0x002AA2F0]
And they're sorely mistaken, I'm known for my might.

Id: [0x002AA2F1]
They say you're a fool, this I tend to believe.

Id: [0x002AA2F2]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002AA2F4]
Who said this about me? I'll kill them outright.

Id: [0x002AA2F5]
Then you've clearly misheard them, my wit is immense.

Id: [0x002AA2F6]
No one would say that, it doesn't make any sense!

Id: [0x002AA2F7]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002AA3DC]
By his strength.

Id: [0x002AA3DD]
With his wisdom.

Id: [0x002AA481]
Talk, or I'll send you to your god.

Id: [0x002AA584]
She has no appetite.

Id: [0x002AA585]
She hungers for you.

Id: [0x002AA586]
You disgust her.

Id: [0x002AA587]
She hasn't slept.

Id: [0x002AA588]
She dreams of you.

Id: [0x002AA589]
She suffers nightmares.

Id: [0x002AA5CA]
I will face the Faceless.

Id: [0x002AA5CB]
This sounds absurd.

Id: [0x002AAAE5]
Where can I learn of His deeds?

Id: [0x002AAAE6]
Take me as I am, a lowly pagan.

Id: [0x002AAAE7]
I will return.

Id: [0x002AAAE8]
His face shone like the sun.

Id: [0x002AAAE9]
He was cleansed in the river.

Id: [0x002AAAEA]
They did not find him when they looked.

Id: [0x002AAAEC]
Let me start again.

Id: [0x002AAAED]
I do not know your stories.

Id: [0x002AAB76]
O, I'll shut your big mouth while I finish my brew.

Id: [0x002AAB77]
No. Enjoy your ale.

Id: [0x002AAB78]
Pour!

Id: [0x002AAB79]
Not now.

Id: [0x002AAB7B]
(Small bet)

Id: [0x002AAB7D]
(Medium bet)

Id: [0x002AAB7F]
(Big bet)

Id: [0x002AAB80]
(Leave)

Id: [0x002AAB81]
I must remind you of your mother!

Id: [0x002AAB82]
Your face brings to mind the arse-end of a horse!

Id: [0x002AAB83]
I'll fight you right now!

Id: [0x002AAB84]
What? Say it again.

Id: [0x002AAB86]
Now to look upon you leaves both my eyes in pain.

Id: [0x002AAB87]
Well, you're thick-skulled and loathsome and lacking a brain.

Id: [0x002AAB88]
Well, at least I'm not you!

Id: [0x002AAB89]
Say that again!

Id: [0x002AAB8B]
Try saying that again, but uncocking your eyes.

Id: [0x002AAB8C]
You've drunk far too much ale, now, you're just telling lies.

Id: [0x002AAB8D]
We should prob'ly call truce before one of us dies.

Id: [0x002AAB8E]
That was incredible! Say it again!

Id: [0x002AAF12]
Make fun of his looks…

Id: [0x002AAF13]
Attack his lack of wit…

Id: [0x002AAF14]
Laugh at his manhood…

Id: [0x002AAF15]
Make fun of his mother…

Id: [0x002AAF16]
Poke at how fat he is…

Id: [0x002AAF17]
Laugh at his lack of height…

Id: [0x002AB011]
Absolutely.

Id: [0x002AB012]
No. It was only a flyt. My winnings please.

Id: [0x002AB037]
I will school you in a war of words.

Id: [0x002AB038]
I've no time for your feeble flytes.

Id: [0x002AB039]
I flyt to win.

Id: [0x002AB03A]
No.

Id: [0x002AB042]
You're an arrogant fool, Thor, and I truly don't envy your plight.

Id: [0x002AB043]
O beware what you ask for, I'll finish the fight.

Id: [0x002AB044]
If I come there, I'll beat you, you'd rather me here.

Id: [0x002AB045]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002AB047]
I'm as wise as an owl, you're a fool of a god.

Id: [0x002AB048]
That you think yourself beloved is very odd.

Id: [0x002AB049]
You're an angry young cretin, your envy is clear.

Id: [0x002AB04A]
Say that again?

Id: [0x002AB04C]
If you think you'll outlast me, I've terrible news.

Id: [0x002AB04D]
Well, your victory's not what my visions portend.

Id: [0x002AB04E]
And I promise that the same fate awaits you, my friend.

Id: [0x002AB04F]
Repeat yourself, please?

Id: [0x002AB159]
This judgment is unfair.

Id: [0x002AB15A]
I support Sigurd's judgment.

Id: [0x002AB85D]
Great horses draw the sun and moon.

Id: [0x002AB85F]

Humans will survive Ragnarok.

Id: [0x002AC54B]
I would have liked him too, I think.

Id: [0x002AC54F]
No, he would have hated me.

Id: [0x002AC550]
(Drink)

Id: [0x002AC74F]
We should ready ourselves for an attack.

Id: [0x002AC7B8]
Your god is not strong enough.

Id: [0x002AC7B9]
Why would you trust me?

Id: [0x002AC7BA]
I should let The Order kill you.

Id: [0x002ACCCD]
What is your name?

Id: [0x002ACCCE]
Why did they take your sister?

Id: [0x002ACD7A]
Gudrun, I will hear from you.

Id: [0x002ACD7B]
Holger, what is your defense?

Id: [0x002ACD7C]
I've heard enough

Id: [0x002ACD7D]
Gudrun is right.

Id: [0x002ACD7E]
Holger is right.

Id: [0x002ACD7F]
(Hear statements again)

Id: [0x002ACDA4]
Rowan, I'll hear from you.

Id: [0x002ACDA5]
Holger, your defense?

Id: [0x002ACDA6]
I've heard enough.

Id: [0x002ACDA7]
Rowan is right.

Id: [0x002ACDA8]
Holger is right.

Id: [0x002ACDA9]
(Hear statements again)

Id: [0x002ACFA5]
Your god fears death as mine do.

Id: [0x002ACFA6]
It was an amusing tale.

Id: [0x002ACFA7]
You have a fine skill for drama.

Id: [0x002AD0D0]
Aelfred believes the Seax is dead.

Id: [0x002AD0D1]
What can you tell me of The Quill?

Id: [0x002AD0DA]
What do you know of The Gallows?

Id: [0x002AD1B3]
Ivarr was wrong.

Id: [0x002AD1B4]
Ivarr was right.

Id: [0x002AD1B5]
What Ivarr did no longer matters.

Id: [0x002AD39C]
Here, spend it well.

Id: [0x002AD39D]
You will get nothing from me.

Id: [0x002AD3A9]

I am looking for The Quill.

Id: [0x002AD677]
What are you up to?

Id: [0x002ADA2B]
I have already learned your lesson.

Id: [0x002ADE2C]
I have money for you.

Id: [0x002ADE2D]
I found no charm.

Id: [0x002ADE51]
I will leave you in peace.

Id: [0x002ADE52]
I believe your brother still lives.

Id: [0x002ADE54]
Your brother's faith was a lie.

Id: [0x002ADEF3]
Brother, return home with me.

I have to go.

What happens now?

Id: [0x002AE82E]
Just a moment.

Id: [0x002AE840]
Outlanders bring coin.

Id: [0x002AE841]
Outlanders cannot outnumber us.

Id: [0x002AE842]
You're an outlander.

Id: [0x002AE843]
How do you know me?

Id: [0x002AE844]
Just a moment.

Id: [0x002AE845]
You do seem familiar.

Id: [0x002AEB7D]
Sorry to hear that.

Id: [0x002AEB7E]
Sounds like an ambush.

Id: [0x002AEB7F]
What about your defenses?

Id: [0x002AEE3B]
I believe in you, Oswald.

Id: [0x002AEE3C]
My settlement's safety is my priority.

Id: [0x002AEE3D]
East Anglia deserved a good leader.

Id: [0x002AF30F]
Where were you?

Id: [0x002AF311]
Tell me about Rollo.

Id: [0x002AF320]
Where were you when the Saxons came?

Id: [0x002AF321]
Did you see anything?

Id: [0x002AF322]
What are you to Rollo?

Id: [0x002AF3B8]
You knew The Leech?

Id: [0x002AF3BB]
I found Regna.

Id: [0x002AF3BC]
This is her leechbook.

Id: [0x002AF6DD]
I did only what you asked.

Id: [0x002AF6DE]
Do this yourself, then.

Id: [0x002AF6DF]

Speak and you may yet live.

Id: [0x002AFC97]
I will hurt you more if I must.

Id: [0x002AFC98]
The sentence for scolding is death.

Id: [0x002AFC99]
Now you will die.

Id: [0x002AFC9A]
We will keep you hostage.

He tried to kill your king.

I'd be happy to join you for dinner.

I alone cannot sway them.

You need to be more like them.

Alcuin's Letter to Charlemagne

Id: [0x002B0C47]
Holy David, an urgent word from your Flaccus,<LF><LF>When last we spoke, I warned you of a rot that I feared was eating at the healthy, still-young flesh of our holy Church. Today I am more convinced than ever that something drastic must be done.<LF><LF>I have lately confirmed that there exist a group of men and women within our Church who belong to a parasitic order of heathens, men and women who wish for nothing less than the perversion of our God's word. As lice upon a loyal hound, they scurry about unseen, using our resources for purposes in opposition to our Savior's plan.<LF><LF>In the past year, I have gleaned what I could about the beliefs of these vile usurpers, who call themselves The Order of the Ancients. Here are but a few of their disturbing ideas:<LF><LF>They believe that mankind was created not by the Lord God, but by lesser and imperfect gods, variously called Isu, Archons, or Nephilim in their various unholy texts. In this way, they follow the unholy heresies of the gnostic sects that flourished in the years before the Nicene Creed.<LF><LF>They refuse the message of the Christ and his redemptive act of sacrifice. They disbelieve in sin and salvation, and seek only knowledge and power, which they believe will free their spirit in the final days.<LF><LF>They believe mankind is a lesser form of life, imperfect in the shadow of these lesser gods, and that it is mankind's sole duty to aspire to the example of these lesser gods.<LF><LF>Their obsession with these ancient ones has led them to make a fetish of diabolical artifacts, which they believe will give them power and righteous cause over their fellow men. These devil's tools I have not seen for myself, but I have observed their effect on a few.<LF><LF>Most blasphemous of their beliefs is perhaps this: they believe many of these lesser gods still walk the earth or may return one day in resurrected forms. Some they believe are continually reborn. These they call sages. Others seem to appear once only and never again. Whether they believe the Lord Jesus Christ to be such a one, I have yet to determine, but their literature is full of references to such beings. <LF><LF>All this I know to be true. In light of this gathering darkness, I urge swift and violent action, my lord, for the reach of this order is vast and their power insidious. Be thou a soldier for our Christ. Only a sustained campaign of eradication will end their advance.<LF><LF>Heed my words with care and wisdom, Noble Charlemagne, and may the Lord God guard thee, exalt thee, and make thee enter the glory of his blessed and everlasting vision.<LF><LF>Your faithful servant,<LF><LF>Alcuin of Eoforwic<LF>10 May, 804 Anno Domini.

Aelfred's Commentaries

Id: [0x002B0C49]
I awoke this morning thinking on Alcuin's final letter to Charlemagne. Written in fear that the Order had corrupted all but his master. Then, dead a week later. Did Charlemagne know? Had the Order corrupted him as well? Did he order the holy man's death? Or did the great emperor not see this letter at all? Long ago, I asked my father how this extraordinary document came into his possession. He had no answer for me. I feared the worst then, as I do now.<LF><LF>Outwardly, Charlemagne was a pious defender of Christ's word. It seems impossible to believe he was under the sway of this corrupted cult. But the Order is expert at hiding its motives. It has stooped to using the Christ's words and the holy book as a front for its blasphemous goals before, and the appearance of piety is all too easy to manufacture. Hoist a bible aloft on the steps of a church and claim divine inspiration. I must be vigilant against such villains.<LF><LF>The Order of Ancients argues for a hierarchy that flies in the face of God's purpose. They view men and women as debased and corrupt, borne of evil intent. Yet they worship men they believe were their makers. Akin to a hammer loving the nail, they cannot see outside their own hermetic system.<LF><LF>They are not wrong to believe that there must be order in the world for peace to flourish. But they are wrong about the source of this order. Man was made in the image of God. God is the source of the universe's order. Therefore man need appeal only to God for guidance.<LF><LF>In a strange irony, I am grateful for the Danes and their invasion of Northumbria. My title should have gone to Aella. Being dead, it fell to my brother and then to me. God's unlikely gift. I will use it to destroy what I loathe so deeply about this sickening Order, and start afresh. Goodwin is with me, as are men on the continent. I will soon find others.<LF><LF>The Order often blesses their pagan creators. What they call the Father of Understanding, the Mother of Wisdom, the Sacred Voice. These are vile blasphemies. There is only one Father of Understanding. He is the Lord above; he is order incarnate.<LF><LF>Therefore, may the Father of Understanding be this and naught else--the invisible hand that plucks harmony from the strings of the universe. Nothing more. Let all remaining pagan blasphemies wither into dust.<LF><LF>Henceforth I aim to improve our lot by harmonizing the average man with the order of the universe. To walk him down a quiet road, to lead him to safe and sober thoughts, to quiet his mind and cool his impassioned heart. Be he God-fearing or God-less, this new Order will encompass all and seek to improve man by aligning his needs with the ebb and flow of nature itself. This is my hope. This is my vow.<LF><LF>Amen.

Letter from Goodwin

Id: [0x002B0C4B]
King Aelfred,<LF><LF>Your spies in Mercia report on a curious development. A faction of Norse recently joined the brothers Ivarr and Ubba in a decisive assault on Tamworth, deposing King Burgred and installing a foolish king's thegn called Ceolwulf in his stead.<LF><LF>In following these Norse back to their settlement, your men discovered the presence of a Hidden One among the pagans who calls himself Hytham. He seems in rather good graces with the two chieftains of this clan, Sigurd Styrbjornsson and Eivor Varinsdottir.<LF><LF>As yet his motives remain unclear, but it may be we can put him to uses of our own. Our "Poor Fellow-Soldier of Christ" has already sent word of the Order's activities to the luminaries of England's major cities. It may be a well-timed letter to Hytham and his companions will speed along our plans considerably.<LF><LF>Your faithful servant,<LF>Reeve Goodwin

Letter from Burgred

Id: [0x002BECAF]
The situation has turned dire. The filthy Danes have taken Tamworth from me! I am trapped, hiding in a muggy crypt with no telling when I may resurface. This is unacceptable! The fate of Mercia now lies in the hands of my thegn, Leofrith, but I have no faith that he can succeed. He is a loyal rat, nothing more, and is now best served as my human shield.<LF><LF>And so, for this matter that must be resolved with the utmost urgency, I am writing to inform you that I have called upon your loyal hunters. And rest assured, you have my promise that this favor will not be forgotten.<LF><LF>The Lord King of Mercia

In the northern and western corner of Suthsexe, under the oldest tree in Chertsey Abbey lies my glory-wealth.<LF>A memorial stone is split, as lightning struck this hoard once it was buried there to illuminate it with God's light.

Id: [0x002C09E5]
In the south and western corner of Hamtunscire, lost in Wishtman's Wood, I ran from the devil with my riches. Fatigued like a hunting hound, the darkness of the trees sending shivers in my spine, an endless fog clouding my vision, a tree of holy red, placed by the Holy Spirit and marked with the Blood of Christ: here. I paid my divine commissions, I gave my wealth to the ancient reliquary, and the Lord pardoned my fees.

Id: [0x002C09E9]
To the south of Essex, your eyes must train themselves away from the tower built by Roman giants, through the green fur of nature, a sacred marking made by three skins of trees in a circle of plants.

Dearest Hilda,<LF><LF>Pagan devils have struck the heart of Grantebridgescire. Luckily, your brother saw them on the Great Ouse before their horde besieged the city walls of Grantebridge.<LF><LF>I'm old, so I cannot stray too far from our fishing hut near the town's southern gate. I will hide our riches in the well behind the house, at the foot of the bent tree. Do not worry, I may be clumsy, but I can still operate a well!<LF><LF>-Your Father, Echbert

Id: [0x002C09EB]
From the top of Forseti's Rest, you will see a lady standing at the southern boundary of Jorvik, looking at the river day and night. The treasure is protected by her trained eye. She is a blessed one, eternally loyal to the relics of lost saints.

Id: [0x002C09EC]
To the east of Lincolnscire, in Skegi's Beard, there lies a stretch of coast detached by the angry sea. From my guard tower wherein lies my dearest of properties, I watch over this land, guarding against the invasion of the barbarians who never cease. This hoard possesses the last relics of the Kingdom of Lindsey, and I forever shall defend it.<LF><LF>Aellen of Mercia

Suthsexe Witch's House Hoard Map

Id: [0x002C09F0]
My iridescence has moved from the diocese. To the south of Snotinghamscire you can find me. Simply venture into the eye of the forest, Minninglow. Look past the forgotten stone portals and past the top of the hill. You will find me ambushed by a family of trees. There my luster lingers.<LF><LF>The Voice of Saint Eanfleda

Suthsexe Crawelie Hoard Map

Id: [0x002C09F4]
In the southern heaths of Oxenefordscire, there is a vast pasture. The livestock act as my protector. They hum and haw away the evil demons. Find the peculiar tree casting its shadow on a small ruin. You can find me where the waters used to run. The lost shimmer of its wavelets still shines within me.

The Cricket Wulf of the Pit

Id: [0x002C0AFB]
When the Bishopric moved, one lonely wolf stayed. The diocese dare not fight it, for locals claim it haunts the land on behalf of Simon the Zealot, who was crucified here.

Id: [0x002C0AFC]
Death Hounds

Id: [0x002C0AFD]
Hunters of Oxenefordscire claim an entire village has fallen victim to these ravenous hounds, who made a witan of flesh, bone, and the innocent. A hefty, pesky sciremoot awaits with these fangs.

Id: [0x002C0AFE]
Blood-Pig

Id: [0x002C0AFF]
Those who know the fine odor of pork will know the grunt of a snout only sated by the blood of humans. This beast has killed seven bishops, all attacked during their sermons. Raiders dare not go near.

The Bear-King of Blue Lake

Id: [0x002C0B03]
A hundred men hath climbed through the hellish froth of Thor's Breath to meet this king, only to be stone-water at the bottom of this sacred lake in the Valley of the Forsaken. This bear was made with ice itself, they say, and born from Thor and Freyja's affair. Beware, for its fangs thirst for the eyes of the idiotic.

Id: [0x002C0B04]
Beast of the Hills

Id: [0x002C0B05]
Welsh hunters warned me, "No kingdom shall take the hills owned by the Beast." They showed me skulls reduced to powder and tracks the size of Roman baths.

Aelfred's Battle-Cattle

Id: [0x002C0B07]
Aelfred is so desperate they say he hath realized that cattle make for better warriors than Saxons. Training calves will only do him harm, as it adds to his folly. However, the calves themselves have supped on blood instead of milk, and appear as though they seek the bosom of Hell in order to suck it into a frenzy.

Wildcats of the Weald

Id: [0x002C0B09]

Mad Shuck

Id: [0x002C0B0B]
O, such howls! Say the Anglians in horror. It haunts the skies. Guthrum shat himself upon hearing the howl of the Black Shuck and left for Winchester, cock between his legs. He nibbles you long so you die slowly hearing him chew.

Helheim's Horned-Pony

This whole shire has soured. Roving bandits at every turn. Just yesterday we caught a few of them rummaging through our things, stealing nets and bait.

Always has been. Stikla would die to protect the life we have built here, but I will not let her. A fisher's pond I can repair, but a life without my love, I cannot.

Here in the ancient Kingdom of Cent, the Jutes have brought me to where his fire burns through traces of the Nephilim.<LF><LF>Here the Lord speaks to me again.

I have heard the voice of His angel, calling me Beloved. Yet the way did not open.<LF><LF>His voice yet calls to me still, in blissful forms, torturous to me. Yet the way remains closed. My way forward is … uncertain.<LF><LF>- Brendan of Clonfert

Governor Tryggr means to interfere with our work. We must eliminate him now and make a grand show of it. Take his head if you desire, and serve his eyes to the river eels.<LF><LF>-Compass<LF><LF>*<LF><LF>His head and eyes will remain with me, for they greatly aid my work.

Ubba, my commander, my friend.<LF><LF>I hope you are in high spirits in this warm weather. While Lunden never gets as cold as Norway, it rains here nearly every day. I feel as cold and grey as a fish. A common affliction here, I've found. <LF><LF>Still, the walls hold strong and our larders stay fat with bounty. I do not miss going a-viking. I've seen enough golden sunrises for my days. Now I am ready to rest on my laurels and have my taste of the city's trollops.<LF> <LF>If you grow tired of sleeping on ships, or of wearing Ivarr around your neck like a noose, there is always a throne for you here. <LF><LF>Your brother in arms,<LF>Tryggr

A sickening display.<LF><LF>I returned a fortnight later with a larger contingent of men to carry out the eviction, but the villa and its surrounding grounds had been vandalized, destroyed, and looted. The daughters have absconded to God knows where, and their hearts are full up with malice. Have a care as you move about the grounds.<LF><LF>Thegn Aethelstan

You shall have the men you ask for and more, but only if you can make clear assurances that the promised aid from Aella of Northumbria will come. If he backs your claim to Mercia, then I shall as well. But I must have proof. I must have your oath.<LF><LF>Swear upon a holy rood and deny the rumors that you dabble in blood-magic, and you shall hear the march of feet and the drum of hooves one week from the Christ-Mass.

Thegn Leofwine,<LF><LF>As a reward for bringing the treasonous acts of Lerion into the light, King Edmund wishes to award you a third portion of the former Ealdorman's estate. Arrangements for Lerion's daughters must first be made. They will make poor wives for the Thegns of East Anglia, but unions with Mercia and Wessex may prove fruitful. <LF><LF>King Edmund continues to worry over the Danes and their leeching demands. Let us leave aside all other conflicts and face this challenge head on, together.<LF><LF>Thegn Aethelstan

Annotated Manuscript

Id: [0x002CEB0A]
In the 849th year of our Lord's incarnation, Aelfred, King of the Anglo-Saxons, burst forth from the loins of his mother (too much?) at the royal vill of Wantage, in Berkshire. Wantage receives its name from Berroc Wood, because of the box trees (will people find this interesting?). His mother was named Osburh, an extremely devout woman, noble in mind, noble also by birth. (Needs a better start? On a dark and stormy night, a woman screamed?).

Ornir's Journal - Einn

Id: [0x002CFF93]
King Harald is no lover of poetry! He desires only the puffed up praised from lesser, mead-soaked skalds! He can banish me from his house, but he will not silence my saga of King Harald the Unfair--one that will be sung long after his bone dust feeds the earth. But first, we must hunt, Ymir and I, and at night when our bellies are full, the poetry will flow like mead.

Food is low. It will take more than honeyed words to lure meat into my pot, and I've yet to master the hunt. Ymir has been bred to this task but has had no better luck. Or he sneaks out while I sleep to sate his appetite in secret. Has he turned on me too? Do the gods toy with me? Like an overfed cat, worrying a rat?

Ymir was out at night, but not to feed. Defending us gainst the darkness as I slept. I buried his remains in the moonlight while his killers howled their dire death-song.

I. The King of Soft Reeds<LF><LF>There was once a man named Rig Reidarasson, yclept Rig "The Slippery Wisdom." He was the son of Reidar Rigsson, also yclept Reidar the Wise, who married Gisla the Axe-Low, and gave birth to both Rig and Helga Gislasdottir the Hugr-Heavy. The family was one of noble lineage, his ancestors having long links to Trondelag and the fylki of Frota. They were part of the last Petty Kingdoms before Harald came to rule.<LF><LF>Rig was born during a storm at sea, with his mother, her six sisters, his grandmother, and his sister at each other's side. With salty waves hitting his face as he emerged from the womb, it is said he miraculously did not cry during this tumultuous birth. As a young man, he was known because he told tales of his visions to all the folk of the fylki. He wandered from town to town and proclaimed, "I have drunk the mead of Odin" and "I have sat at the great table with all of the Aesir and the Swellers of Glory! They all know my name."<LF><LF>One warrior yclept Sklati hated this "loudmouth." Sklati forced his huge son to fight Rig in a duel, but Rig shone brighter in battle, honorably winning yet not taking Sklati's son's life. Instead, he demanded Sklati's majestic and giant horn. Rig blew it and took it as a spoil. Returning to Frosta, he filled it with mead, and his first nickname was Rig the Horn-Filler.

II. The Tricking of Ergon Blade-Tongue<LF><LF>The winters passed and Rig grew mighty but lean, a great warrior that fought in great battles along the Northern Way. He was often spilling raven-wine defending the family clan in constant battle with a rival Kingdom to the south, known as the Whale Clan, led by Ergon Blade-Tongue who, as legend has it, ate a sword in the midst of battle.<LF><LF>Rig was only twelve winters old, but it is said he grabbed a rival warrior and clenched him so hard in a head lock that he tore the man's head clean off. That night as he drank, he returned to the head and heard it sing, "You will be betrayed by the last curtain." He kept the skull of his enemy, and from that day forth, any man who challenged Rig to battle would have to talk to the skull. This they say gave him an advantage, and he won many battles and gained his second nickname, Rig Skull-Talker.

III. The Lay of Solveig<LF><LF>One year when Spring came, Rig fell in love. His ways had caught the eye of Solveig, a thrall in charge of making mead. Legend says that she was swimming in a barrel of honey-waves when Rig arrived and dipped in his mug to fill it. Solveig grabbed the mug and pulled Rig into the giant vat. Thus did she earn the name Solveig Maiden-of-Mead. That night, Solveig and Rig went on a long walkabout through the woods and there consummated their love.<LF><LF>Upon their return, however, they found that Rig's family had been captured and burnt alive at an Althing in Trondheim, having been accused by Ergon Blade-Tongue of using black seidr, Rig's talking skull being the proof. Rig was appalled by this act of violence against his family, a miscarriage of justice and a perversion of honor so vile that Rig vowed revenge. But it would not come that day, for King Hadon, at Egon's urging, had issued an order of exile against the lovers.<LF><LF>Rig and Solveig packed their belongings and made as if to leave Trondheim, as King Hadon had ordered. At dusk they set sail with many great and loyal warriors, while Egon sneered at their departure. But that evening Rig and Solveig returned under cover of dark, cloaked like One-Eye. They snuck into the village to finish the job with Ergon, killing him and removing his leg as a trophy, which they stood outside for all to see. This earned Rig a new nickname, The Ghost of Trondheim. The following morning King Hadon was forced to put a bounty on their heads and Ergon's son, Bolli Ergonsson, vowed revenge.<LF><LF>The two lovers escaped for England, sailing with their most loyal drengir, as King Hadon's hunters followed in close pursuit. Heavily outnumbered, Rig and Solveig hatched a cunning plan. They hid inside a beached whale carcass with several warriors and remained there for ten nights. On the first night, Rig and Solveig made love in front of their fellow warriors, who cheered them on until the ninth day when their first child, Erik Whaleborn was born. That evening, as she held her child, Solveig heard Rig talking and shouting in his sleep, a thing he had never done before. "I will drink of the elixir, Father!" he screamed from a dream. "I will find you again on the other side of doom!" Through these fits, Solveig held her lover's hand long into the night, kissing his wet brow.<LF><LF>On the tenth day, the threat of Hadon's bounty-hunters was gone. Rig and Solveig changed their names to Erik Whaleborn and Silla the Sea-Queen for a time until they could commandeer a ship and a group of warriors to then head for the coast of England in search of a new life.

IV. The Language of Gold<LF><LF>In the 820th year after our savior's sacrifice, Rig came upon me, Brissy the Sage, and my brothers at Whitby Abbey. His men slaughtered many innocents, however Rig himself suddenly stopped this violence upon entering our scriptorium. I held up Gilda's Book in hopes it would protect me. Rig was enamored by the golden finery of the room.<LF><LF>"I have many names, but none of them are slayer of those who are fragile and unarmed … and those who make such beauty … this eternal knowledge of the leather-rune-keeper," he said to us. He took me as a thrall and wished to settle with him nearby the Abbey. He dared not take it for himself, for he believed this would deliver evil upon him. He was especially enamored by our illuminated texts and the gold ink we had used to color these texts.<LF><LF>At the site of an ancient Roman outpost, he settled with his warriors and founded the town of Goldness, which would later become Goldborough. In my time beside Rig, I taught him my trade as a luminer and he took a strong kindrance to the art of lumineering. He found particular solace in the gold textures and would go to any length to find gold ink or make it himself. He invaded a gold mine in the Peaklands to ensure the resource was always available. He began to wear golden crosses.<LF>Here he became known as "Rig the Converted". He swore he would make war with anyone Dane or Christian who dare tamper with our sacred art.

V. The Gold-Generous Warrior of Light<LF><LF>After these events, Rig's name grew in legend, and King Hadon, still irked by what had happened in Trondheim, sent a war party to seek revenge.<LF><LF>Rig was riding on his horse when he saw Hadon's black ships landing. They were many, battle-ready warriors. He quickly rode back to Goldness and looked at his scared citizens. He smiled from the walls of Goldness. "We will lose this battle if we fight it. But some battles can be won without fighting." He ordered his men to use all of the gold ink for books and paint the horses of the clan gold. This was done quickly, and he ordered his best horsemen to ride with him.<LF><LF>They rode until at earshot of Hadon's marching army. He waited for the sun to be low and instructed his men to strike hard and fast following his lead. Hadon's warriors were blinded as the sun reflected off the horse, and even his golden-toothed smile sent blinding rays at the warriors. The Golden Horse of Rig led a fierce, iridescent lightning-strike slaughter. Fear had entered the souls of these warriors. "We cannot fight an enemy who burns our eyes!" they told their captain. <LF><LF>They retreated and only found out later that Rig had ridden with no more than ten brave men. Goldness celebrated, and so his legacy grew. The golden horse of Rig was Golddrassil, and it grew famous within the Kingdom of the North. When it died, it was burned on a pyre with eight human sacrifices and two-hundred cows. It was this time he was known as "Rig the Gold-Skin."

VI. The Golden Dragon Who Climbed Mountains<LF><LF>News of Rig's wealth and war-savvy made rival kingdoms angry, and the ancient Lords of Elmet were especially angry and sought allies to overthrow him. Bolli had ventured to England and allied with this bitter kingdom and kidnapped Solveig, planning a great torture of her, whom was now mother of six boys and four girls.<LF><LF>With Solveig captured, Rig set out along the river with twelve ships but was pushed back in the Vale of Woden, which was the only path that led to their castle within the mountains. Their golden ships were no match for the well-defended fortress of the Elmetians and Bolli and the thick brush.<LF><LF>Retreating in anger, Rig then noticed a plume of smoke rising from their castle over a great peak. He stopped and commanded his men to carry their ships over the mountain. Great numbers of them died as a storm approached, but Rig pushed on, and as the morning fog settled, Elmetian scouts noticed golden dragonheads looking at them. Panic-stricken, they screamed "Dragons! Dragons from the hills!" sending soldiers and folkspeople into a frenzy. Rig took advantage of this turmoil and destroyed the kingdom completely, saving Solveig and cleaving off Bolli's head, using it to sing for eight straight nights of song and drinking. After this day, Rig was known as the "Golden Flying Dragon."

VII. The Only Queen of England<LF><LF>At this point, Rig began hearing voices ever louder in his mind. "You must ready your queen," it told him, over and over. To the ridicule of all other kingdoms, Rig proclaimed Solveig "Queen of the North." He sent word to the various ealdormancies, yet all messages were returned with scorn or ridicule. Rig's lucky skull began to speak "The gods' fate is determined at the blast of your horn," it sang. He would blow his great horn. <LF><LF>Rig called a Witan in which various nobles from Mercia, Wessex, and Northumbria came. Here Solveig dressed herself as a man and called herself "the King of Goldness." This confused the members of the Witan, who viewed it as a farce. But before the Witan had concluded, Solveig declared "Our shire will allow for the taxing of dogs, and so you owe Goldness tribute." Rig slaughtered any who would not bend the knee to the Queen. This stained his reputation, but his infamy grew as Solveig became known as the "The Only Queen of England."<LF><LF>At this point in time, Rig was told by the voice that occupied his head, "Your father will lead you true, for you are his perfect son. Wait for him in Himinbjorg until the day of battle." Later, Rig wrote down a poem in golden ink to explain the state of his mind:<LF><LF>Better, I see now<LF>To follow those<LF>Who came before<LF>For so dark a dream<LF>Unrealized. Flows<LF>The Dew of Distress<LF>Lost forever

VIII. The Gods Speak To Me<LF><LF>Long afterwards, Rig grew old and tired, always in desperation to seek out a solution to quiet the voices. Consulting his volva and his monks did not seem to help. In his throne room he told his thegns, his trusted drengir, and those close to him, "I am to die soon but not at the hand of my foes. Nor will I die in a barrel of ale. I will follow the gods to their holiest of temples and drink from the grail that makes us immortal." He desired a final pilgrimage to see Miklagard, the house of the gods he called it.<LF><LF>The voice that spoke to him grew louder and angrier in the weeks following his announcement, warning him of a treacherous day. "You are the son that left Goldness and traveled east." "The old gods torment me, but my newfound God loves me," he told Brissy. "My new God will grant me truth and eternal life." He took a flotilla of men to Miklagard, to seek penitence and solace as a complete convert but also as an angel to God. For him, this pilgrimage would seal his destiny and allow him full communion with this voice that pestered his mind.

IX. The Death of the One Who Heard Voices<LF><LF>One day, Rig awoke on the longship and stared out at the coast. He consulted the old skull that once sang to him, then turned to his shipmates. "We dock here," he said. He walked onto the pier and smiled. This was the city of Constantine, the majestic Miklagard. There he met many different people, and for a time, Rig was lively once again and learned much, communing with God and old warriors from different sects. The voice remained and instructed him he must confront a Man with the Mark in the House of Shadows. He was to kill him or else he would be killed by him.<LF><LF>He returned from the House of Shadows with blood on his body and refused to answer any questions, though he did say, "I have come before my time. I was born too early and I am alone, without my father, without my friends." None understood the meaning of this statement.<LF><LF>Rig then set out to return home by way of the Rusland. During this time, he grew angrier with every flutter of our sails. "My mind will be moved on, it must be preserved. I have seen it. My last fate is to live again in the hall of my father until he should come again." Whatever Rig meant by this grand idea, it was not to be.<LF><LF>Some days later, he was dead. We found him hunched over a goblet with a sword through his heart. Solveig came to his side, weeping. "Please don't let him have died with no scroll, no word in his name." In the corner of the same room stood a snickering woman who looked like a goat. "I am the sister of Bolli, daughter of Hadon. I have tracked you for a thousand moons to have this moment. Now I can return to Trondheim as queen of my people, vindicator of my blood. I will let you live so you can give him an honorable death." Then she left, and I sat down to write Rig's saga…

X. The Shimmering Creek<LF><LF>After his death, the body of Lord Rig, ruler of Goldness was returned home on a perilous journey up the Volga through Rusland. Solveig fought off various tribes to secure his body's passage back home. He was brought to the shimmering creek where he had painted gold a statue of Odin and a cross. His body was buried beneath the creek with axe and cross in hand. There is a runestone there with his many names upon it.<LF><LF>In his death, he became known as "The Keeper of the Shimmer of Rivers Unseen to the Eye".<LF><LF>If you lay your body in the river, with the rushing waters caressing your skin, you will hear his song in the shine of the sun. If the creek shimmers in your favor, Rig will send you good luck. He is the skull-beneath-the-waters, the skald-of-lost-rivers. His song is simple and a melody Bragi is jealous of, and it is said he will return one day but only as a wave, his bones made of mead-marrow, and only when the tree of life is rotten away and hewn by waves into tiny chips.<LF><LF>Some skalds refer to the "Chips of Ygdrassil," which is a kenning of Rig, He Who Was Mighty and Forgotten, He Who Outlives the Valkyries, He Who Knocked on Thrones. I know he was wronged by someone and the voices that spoke in him are real. They are the ancient threads that tangle and tie until someone can make the world right again.

Id: [0x002D3310]
Palatinus Selwyn, The Gallows<LF><LF>Selwyn came from a rich family where he was used to lording it over servants and serfs alike. He did not take kindly to his father's drinking, gambling, womanizing, and dissipating the family fortune. He views his lineage with shame and distaste. He had to drag himself up from the filth and shed the moral decrepitude that results in giving the weak freedom.<LF><LF>The Order gave him control. Determined to save people from themselves. He set about to enforce the law, enact judgment, and rid the world of human effluence.

Ealhferth

Id: [0x002D3317]
Preost Ealhferth, The Seax<LF><LF>Ealhferth was born into a poor but devout family of Christian settlers in the northern wilds. Devoted to his mother, he followed her everywhere. She, in turn, would hold him close and whisper wondrous stories of God's everlasting love and kindness.<LF><LF>This made her murder at the hands of the pagan Norse raiders all the more difficult for Ealhferth to bear. From that day, The Seax was at war with God. But only with the Order did he find sweet revenge. He posed as God's mouthpiece in Wincestre. Controlling lords and peasants from the pulpit.

The Krakumal of Ragnar Lothbrok

Id: [0x002D4B70]
So I must write. Many a skald is willing to chirp and gossip about some endless heroic greatness in order to secure a pouch full of silver. However, I come from rich Northumbrian stock and have no need of gilded reward for my words. You see, I was an enemy of him for whom I write. Let me tell you the true Ragnarsdrapa and what I saw in one instance when Ragnar Lothbrok was sent to his end. I met the warriors who trained under him, behind him, in front of him, but mostly FOR him. Pledged were so many, Never have I seen so many oaths taken for one man. They called themselves Drengr. And though he died, he loved them all as sons and gods and daughters and queens, that I am certain of.<LF><LF>I was a mere minor officer in King Aelle's army, which is why I can bare the facts of what happened to this great warrior. Many moons after I was captured by Ivar the Boneless, and amidst the Dane warrior class, I learned the extent of Ragnar Lothbrok's violent sinew. Ragnar Saggy-Britches, Ragnar the Unifier, Ragnar the Roar of All Drengr.<LF><LF>I saw his death, but it was no death. It was merely another page having been written in a saga like none other this world has seen. All those soldiers under King Aelle were changed that day near Stamford Bridge by the pit of snakes.

Regions

Id: [0x002D5629]
Norway

Id: [0x002D562A]
Norway is home to a people as beautiful and harsh as the unforgiving land that birthed them. Its frozen fields, majestic mountains, and fathomless fjords are the setting for deeds desperate and heroic made famous through sagas and song.<LF><LF>Not a bad start for a novel, is it? Saving this one for later.

Id: [0x002D562B]
Northumbria

Id: [0x002D562C]
The name conjures visions of Hadrian's Wall, misty Jorvik, and Danish thanes and Saxon housecarls staring at mobs of howling Picts through flurries of snow. Yet the name simply means "north of the Humber River." Bloody geographers and their lack of imagination!

Id: [0x002D562D]
Mercia

Id: [0x002D562E]
The Kingdom of Mercia, situated in England's midlands, reached its height of power and prestige under King Offa, a prominence that lasted for close to three hundred years. During that time, it was a center of trade and industry until Danish incursions left it in ruin.

Id: [0x002D562F]
East Anglia

Id: [0x002D5630]
Once a powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom, East Anglia collapsed into a sinkhole of blood and misery under decades of war and attrition. Relentless attacks from the Mercians and then the Norse took a swift toll. Hard to believe that so many would fight over little more than bogs and swamps.

Id: [0x002D5631]
Wessex

Id: [0x002D5632]
Wessex, which means "the Kingdom of the West Saxons," was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom in the south of Great Britain, founded in 519. Under the stewardship of King Aethelwulf and his sons, which included Aelfred, it proved a hard nut to crack for the invading Vikings of the Great Heathen Army.

Id: [0x002D5639]
The Raven Clan's Settlement

Id: [0x002D563A]
Built from the ruins of an abandoned wintering camp once occupied by the Great Heathen Army, this settlement is now the permanent home of the Raven Clan. It is also where you may find Randvi's alliance table, Gunnar's forge, Yanli's shop, Rowan's stable, and other useful services.

Id: [0x002D563B]
Hidden Ones Bureau

Id: [0x002D563C]
Formed in Egypt in the first century BCE, the Hidden Ones rapidly expanded their reach and influence with the growth of the Roman Empire. Wherever they went, they built clandestine bureaus from which they could conduct their secret work. <LF><LF>Their first bureaus in Britain appeared a few decades after Emperor Claudius established a firm foothold on the island. By the time the Romans abandoned Britain in the 5th century BC, there were six bureaus in England.<LF><LF>Today, my hidden bureau is an office I share with Becs and our washer and dryer. It works all right, but we may be turning it into a baby room if all goes well.

Id: [0x002D563D]
Yggdrasil

Id: [0x002D563E]
A massive simulation device built by the Isu over 75,000 years ago. From what we have seen, it appears this device was one method the Isu used to generate and explore possible futures, alternate realities, and counterfactual histories. With the right input, it could generate any sort of reality the user desired.

Id: [0x002D5640]
Isu Barracks

Id: [0x002D5641]
Built beneath the Stonehenge monument, this cavern served as a barracks for the Celtic Isu pantheon. By the shape of the stones here, it's a good bet the Neolithic people discovered it and did their best to recreate the shape above ground. I'd say they were about as successful as a toddler trying to make a replica of Parliament with a handful of Greek yogurt.

Id: [0x002D5642]
Repton

Id: [0x002D5643]
In the 9th century, Repton was the political center of power for the Mercian royal family. It also held symbolic importance as the burial site of Mercian kings.<LF><LF>Around 873, Halfdan Ragnarsson and his army took the mausoleum and used the church as the gatehouse to their wintering camp--a not so subtle power move.

He could sail through the putrid, poisoned rivers of Helheim and spin it into a tale that would have every warm-blooded vikingr fighting for a place on his ship.<LF><LF>It's also clear to anyone who knew him well that Sigurd was perhaps too inclined to believe his own hype.

Basim Ibn Ishaq

Id: [0x002D564D]
A common first impression of Basim is a mixture of danger and intrigue. Soon thereafter, one might get the sense of someone thinking several moves ahead. In fact, he is likely playing an entirely different game.<LF><LF>Basim met Sigurd Styrbjornsson on the same day he received a contract for a prominent player from the prince's homeland. He knew the gods had favored him, but he didn't care which.<LF><LF>As mysterious and seemingly aloof as the shadowy brotherhood he represents, Basim's ultimate goal is unknown even to his protégé, Hytham, who is closer to him than anyone still living.

Aelfred

Id: [0x002D564F]
The youngest son of Aethelwulf, King of Wessex until 858 CE.<LF><LF>As a child, Aelfred made a pilgrimage with his father to Rome, where he was blessed by Pope Leo IV. The pontiff recounted to the boy his success in defeating the Saracens at the Battle of Ostia. The grandeur and solemnity of the Roman Church made a lasting impression on young Aelfred. With five older brothers, Aelfred had little expectation of becoming king, and so devoted himself to scholarly pursuits, beginning a life-long interest in learning.<LF><LF>When Wessex became the target of Viking raids, Aelfred fought alongside his brother Aethelred, now king, and proved himself a more than capable commander. The storied battles of Reading, Ashdown, Wilton, and others followed. Aelfred succeeded to the crown when Aethelred died from wounds sustained at the Battle of Marton.<LF><LF>Eventually, he came to be known as Aelfred the Great for his heroic defense of England. But for the life of him, he couldn't manage the simple task of baking a cake.

Ivarr and Ubba

Id: [0x002D5651]
Ivarr and Ubba Ragnarsson were two sons of the legendary Ragnar Lothbrok. When Ragnar was killed by the Northumbrian King Aella, his sons sought revenge, and so began the invasion of the Great Heathen Army.<LF><LF>Legendary in their own right, Ivarr and Ubba led their army through many conquests across the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. They invaded Northumbria and got their revenge on Aella by way of the blood eagle, a ritual execution, the details of which I will omit, as I have just had my lunch.<LF><LF>From there, the brothers invaded the kingdoms of Mercia and East Anglia, yet not merely for pillage and plunder. The brothers wanted control. It was the thrones they were after, and there wasn't much in their way to stop them.<LF><LF>Here's an interesting bit: Throughout his campaigns, Ivarr earned himself the nickname "the boneless," though it is not clear why. He may have suffered from a rare degenerative bone disease. Some tales speak of him as having a fluid fighting style, as if he had no bones beneath his skin, while others say the name was coined because of a certain … performance issue. I think it's fair to say the Danes are of the former camp, and the Saxons are of the latter.

Bandits

Id: [0x002D5734]
Bandit groups thrived in the 9th century and were found all across the seven kingdoms. They were mostly made up of the impoverished, the disenfranchised, and the just plain scoundrels who sought to make a living off violence and intimidation.

Vikings

Id: [0x002D5736]
In Old Norse, a "vikingr" was a Norse man or woman who went raiding for gain and glory, both for themselves and their clan. To "go a-Viking" was one of the most exhilarating feats of bravery anyone could imagine.<LF><LF>Over time, the word Viking became a general term to describe the hordes of Norsemen who raided and settled various parts of Europe between the 8th and 11th centuries. Somewhat less barbaric than their initial depictions, Vikings were in fact part of a larger and more complex social structure, as likely to trade with another culture instead of killing them.

Id: [0x002D5737]
Saxons

Id: [0x002D5738]
Originating from the coast of what is now northern Germany, Saxons invaded and settled Britannia at some point in the 5th century BCE, replacing the outgoing Roman Empire as the islands occupying force.<LF><LF>Thereafter, they spread east to form Essex, south to form Sussex, west to form Wessex and north to form Middlesex. This laid the foundation for what would later become the seven kingdoms of the Heptarchy.<LF><LF>Seen today as archetypal Christians, Saxons only adopted Christianity in the 7th century by way of the Jutes, another Germanic tribe who had previously been converted.

Id: [0x002D5739]
Britons

Id: [0x002D573A]
Hostile to both Saxons and the Norse, the Britons come from a cluster of kingdoms along England's western border that would coalesce to become modern Wales. Because of their independent spirit and distinctive language, the Britons were often in conflict with both Mercia and Wessex. During the 8th century, King Offa of Mercia established a border in the form of a long earthwork.<LF><LF>More like a ditch, really.<LF><LF>In the 9th century, Rhodri ap Merfyn rose to assimilate several other kingdoms in the nascent step to forming Wales, thus becoming known as King of the Britons. His nimble forces countered both Mercian and Viking invaders.

Vinland

Id: [0x002D6A59]
By most historic accounts, the Norse reached Vinland around AD 1000, led by Leif Erikson. But the Order of the Ancients knows better.<LF><LF>So where exactly was Vinland? West of Greenland to be certain, but the sagas also mention Helluland and Markland too. It was possibly in modern-day Newfoundland or further to the south. Scholars continue to debate.

Id: [0x002D6A5A]
Asgard

Id: [0x002D6A5B]
Home to the vast pantheon of Norse gods, Asgard is a Viking paradise where warfare is a way of life and death. Here lies Valhalla -- Odin's hall of the slain where chosen champions engage in non-stop feasting and blood sports until that final day when all are called to fight in Ragnarok, the battle that will end the world as they know it.

Id: [0x002D6A5C]
Jotunheim

Id: [0x002D6A5D]
Jotunheim was the home of the Jotnar, giants of Nordic myth. It was a frozen, mountainous place, steeped in magic and illusion.<LF><LF>To the Viking mind, the Jotnar represented the forces of chaos that would consume their world during Ragnarok, the war at the end of time. It was therefore seen as a perilous place for their gods to tread.

Id: [0x002D6A5E]
Jorvik

Id: [0x002D6A5F]
Nestled squarely in the middle of Northumbria was the town of Jorvik -- now known as York -- the centerpiece of political power in northern England. Called Eboracum by the Romans and Eoforwic by the Saxons, Jorvik was a hub of international trade in the 9th century. Goods from the world over could be found at Coppergate Market, and if you weren't careful, one could as easily lose their purse there.

Id: [0x002D6A60]
Lunden

Id: [0x002D6A61]
Ninth-century Lunden was in a transitional period. It was largely abandoned by Christians, believing the ruins of the old Roman City to be haunted. But the grand architecture proved to be a great shelter and landmark, so the site was used by the Summer Army during their occupation.

Id: [0x002D6A62]
Wincestre

Id: [0x002D6A63]
Nestled deep inside Wessex, Wincestre is the heart of Christian faith in Anglo-Saxon England. Under King Aelfred, it has become a city of enlightenment, piety, and progressive reform. The king has spared no expense in the construction of churches and the translation and illumination of religious texts.

Id: [0x002D6A64]
Dalby Forest

Id: [0x002D6A65]
The harsh winters stripped the trees of their leaves in Dalby Forest, tearing away the bark and outer layers, and felling others in storms long forgotten. Some say they can hear soft whispers and the laughter of children at night. Others say it's just the wind.

Id: [0x002D6A67]
Sherwood Forest

Id: [0x002D6A69]
Sherwood Forest, future home of Robin Hood and his merry men, according to legend, anyway. The place is thick with tall, old trees whose shadows bring to mind ancient legends and more.

Id: [0x002D6A6C]
Aelfwood

Id: [0x002D6A6D]
Ethereal and otherworldly, Aelfwood was the site of many iron mines, a good spot for picnicking, and--according to some locals--an entry to the realm of the fae. This sacred location in Glowecestrescire was rich in greenery and biodiversity, and still inspires stories to this day.

Id: [0x002D6A6E]
Ciltern Hills

Id: [0x002D6A6F]
Named for the Brittonic Cilternsaete tribe and now known as the Chiltern Hills, this rolling green peacefulness makes a pleasant arc northwest of London. It held a substantial Roman presence -- likely the Cilternsaete weren't so happy about that -- and, much later, I summered there as a lad.

Id: [0x002D6A70]
Epinga Forest

Id: [0x002D6A71]
Though we are nowadays accustomed to think of forests as pleasant places to walk, in the Dark Ages they were dangerous places, rife with spirits and crawling with bandits. Epinga Forest -- now Epping Forest -- was a haven for criminals preying on travelers from London to the south, and rightfully regarded with suspicion.

Id: [0x002D6A72]
Wishtman's Wood

Id: [0x002D6A73]
This oak wood is a remnant of an ancient forest that is almost 9,000 years old. Its name may have derived from the local dialect word "wisht," meaning "eerie" or "haunted." The hellhounds of the legendary Wild Hunt are known as Wisht Hounds in the local Devonshire dialect.

Id: [0x002D6A74]
Isle of Wiht

Id: [0x002D6A75]
England's largest island, just off the south coast. Originally named Wihtwara, meaning "Men of Wiht," after Wihtgar, a nephew of Cerdic who was one of the earliest kings of Wessex. Bede records that in subsequent years, it traded hands between the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex, amid much slaughter.

Id: [0x002D6A76]
Cyning Vale

Id: [0x002D6A77]
Now Kingley Vale, one of Europe's greatest yew forests. Highly poisonous, yew was a druidic symbol of both death and resurrection. It was sometimes planted in graveyards in the belief that its roots would grow through and seal the eyes of the dead. Sleep tight, everyone.

Id: [0x002D6A78]
Long Man

Id: [0x002D6A79]
The Long Man of Wilmington is a hill figure found on the steep slopes of Windover Hill in East Sussex. Its origin is uncertain; scholars argue over whether it was fashioned in the Neolithic period, the Iron Age, or later. And those are staves in his hands, not skis.

Id: [0x002D6A7A]
The Weald

Id: [0x002D6A7B]
This ancient site, now in Ashdown Forest, has expansive views over the surrounding land. In Roman times it was an important center of the iron industry; in the modern day, it is more famous as the inspiration for the Hundred Acre Wood in "Winnie-the-Pooh."

Id: [0x002D6A7C]
Seven Sisters

Id: [0x002D6A7D]
The Seven Sisters are a series of chalk cliffs on the south coast of England, often used as a stand-in for the White Cliffs of Dover in films because the White Cliffs really aren't all that white these days, and you're liable to get a ferry wandering into shot.

Id: [0x002D6A7E]
Cleofa Sands

Id: [0x002D6A7F]
Unlike most of the beaches in England, what is now called Camber Sands is actually made of sand rather than sole-shredding pebbles. So rare is it to find dunes on this scepter'd isle that the British Army used it as a training ground for storming the beaches at Normandy during World War II.

Id: [0x002D6A80]
Aeld Wyrm

Id: [0x002D6A81]
Hill figures, like megaliths, were often seen as a way to exert control over a landscape that must have seemed sometimes frightening and immutable to primitive civilizations. This chalk figure of a snake was probably an appeal to some forgotten god, but by modern times, its meaning was lost to history.

Id: [0x002D6A82]
White Cliffs of Dover

Id: [0x002D6A83]
The eight-mile stretch of coastline on either side of the town of Dover is renowned for its striking, sheer white cliffs of chalk. The chalk is made up of countless trillions of coccoliths, the skeletons of tiny algae, piled up in layers and crushed. Quite macabre, when you think about it.

Jotnar

Singular: Jotun<LF><LF>The Jotnar are the denizens of Jotunheim, descendants of Ymir, the first being according to Norse myth.<LF><LF>Though often referred to as giants or trolls, they are not all ugly and twisted, but sometimes beautiful. <LF><LF>Known as shape-changers and tricksters, the god Loki is half Jotun, and Odin is descended from them.

Id: [0x002D6B73]
The Zealots

Id: [0x002D6B74]
The Zealot warriors have been committed to the Order of the Ancients for most of their lives, serving them at its most ruthless and down-to-earth grind: wandering the earth in search of anyone who attempts to cross the sacred order. <LF><LF>I would not want to get in a bar fight with these fierce foot soldiers of the Order, as they all have unique training from ancient schools within the Anglian, Saxon, and Brittonic warrior codes. And though their paganism still shines, it is cloaked heavily by the Christian supremacy of the times.

Rotinonhsión:ni

Id: [0x002D6B76]
The "People of the Longhouse" were sturdy folk who tolerated the Vikings … up to a point, anyway. Long established in North America, their ways would remain long after the Viking ways had come and gone.

Id: [0x002D6B77]
The Hidden Ones

Id: [0x002D6B78]
The Hidden Ones were an early incarnation of the modern Assassin brotherhood, a clandestine group of self-proclaimed freedom fighters who worked to liberate mankind from oppression and cruelty.<LF><LF>Formed in Egypt in 47 BCE following the turmoil of the Ptolemaic civil war, the Hidden Ones came together after its founding members, Bayek and Aya, bore firsthand witness to the cruelty and capricious abuses of power of the Order of the Ancients. To combat this vast and shadowy network of autocrats and Isu-supremacists, the Hidden Ones obscured their identities and worked from the shadows to unmask, undermine, and remove the Order at every turn.<LF><LF>With the inception and rapid growth of the Roman Empire under Caesar Augustus, so too did the Hidden Ones' Brotherhood expand. By the end of the First Century CE, the Hidden Ones had established bureaus as far west as the British Isles and as far East as modern-day India.<LF><LF>With the subsequent collapse of the Roman Empire in the 5th century, the Hidden Ones retreated from some of its outlying territories, eventually establishing its strongest foothold in the kingdoms and caliphates of the eastern Mediterranean.<LF><LF>As the Hidden Ones evolved, they adopted a set of three tenets to guide them.<LF><LF>1) Stay your blade from the flesh of an innocent.<LF>2) Hide in plain sight.<LF>3) Never compromise the brotherhood.<LF><LF>Early members of the Hidden Ones also adopted a maxim with nihilistic overtones, quite uncharacteristic for the age in which it was first voiced. "Nothing is true; everything is permitted." The meaning of this phrase, and its purpose, has been a subject of considerable debate even among the Hidden Ones and the Assassins.

Id: [0x002D6B79]
The Order of the Ancients

Id: [0x002D6B7A]
The Order of the Ancients was a precursor group to the modern Templar Order, with whom they shared many general beliefs: namely, that humans are inherently predisposed to chaos and violence, and that order and peace must be imposed on society by the strongest and wisest members of society.<LF><LF>Just who constituted these "strongest and wisest" is where the two groups diverged. Since its founding by the Egyptian pharaoh Smenkhkare in 1334 BCE, the Order of the Ancients preached a doctrine that celebrated humanity's creators, the Isu, as an inherently superior race. According to the Order's central tenets, mankind could only achieve its full potential by emulating our progenitors and adopting their culture, ideals, and technology.<LF><LF>Isu worship was fundamental to the Order's existence. Humans who took an anthropocentric view of reality, or those who preached the equivalence of Isu and human culture, were seen as decadent and heretical. The Order's ultimate goal was to recreate Isu societies on earth and, if possible, resurrect the Isu by whatever means necessary.<LF><LF>By the 9th century CE, with the rise of Christianity and Islam, the Order's influence began to wane. Yet they were able to establish a final stronghold in northwestern Europe, organized as a compartmentalized constellation of members, each one adopting a codename to maintain the highest level of secrecy.<LF><LF>The Order organized itself in a hierarchy of five ranks: Zealots were the Order's enforcers. Priests and seers occupied the Preost rank. Judges, merchants, and soldiers were Palatinii. The Maegesters occupied the top rank of each sect, while the Grand Maegester reigned supreme.

Kinsmen

Id: [0x002D6B9F]
Seasoned veterans who coordinate their attacks, the Saxon Kinsmen fight in tandem with an almost psychic sense of what each other are up to.<LF><LF>Whereas one is defensive and quick, his comrade will be aggressive and deadly.

Militia

Id: [0x002D6BA5]
Militia fight dirty!<LF><LF>They throw mud and dirt to blind opponents and hammer away with makeshift clubs and crude seaxes.<LF><LF>They gang up against their strongest opponent first and are perfectly happy to take cheap shots when their enemies are incapacitated.

An all-out attack is not advised

Id: [0x002D6BB3]
Rogue

Id: [0x002D6BB4]
Sneaky little rotters who attack from hidden positions. Their greatest fear is to be caught out in the open.<LF><LF>When flushed out of hiding, they seek to confuse their adversaries with smoke bombs.

Sleekit

Id: [0x002D6BBC]
Berserkr

Id: [0x002D6BBD]
Highly energetic fighters able to maintain a steady, aggressive, and nearly interminable combo axe attack.<LF><LF>After wreaking much havoc, they stop every now and again for a much-deserved breather.

Id: [0x002D6BBE]
React quickly to maintain distance

Id: [0x002D6BBF]

Id: [0x002D6BC1]
Parry his attacks

Id: [0x002D6BC4]
Slinger

Id: [0x002D6BC5]
Out of their element on the battlefield, these hapless souls are nonetheless annoyingly accurate with the ol' slingshot.<LF><LF>However, no one ever trained them to really fight, and they'd much rather be someplace else.

Id: [0x002D6BC6]
Rid yourself of this annoyance as soon as possible

Id: [0x002D6BC7]
Ceorl

Id: [0x002D6BC8]
The basic Saxon warrior. Individually not very threatening but as a group, they become a problem.<LF><LF>They're opportunistic on the battlefield and pick up weapons from fallen foes to surprise you with a new attack.

Id: [0x002D6BC9]
Change tactics based on his current weapon

Id: [0x002D6BD0]
Man at Arms

Id: [0x002D6BD1]
Cocky veterans who gave up the army to turn their experience and skill to lucrative banditry.<LF><LF>Skilled and savvy defenders, they easily counter frontal attacks. They are also tough attackers.<LF><LF>They can't always beat you, but they will certainly insult you.

Stay aggressive

Id: [0x002D6BD9]
Boar Master

Id: [0x002D6BDA]
Agents of chaos with complete disregard for anyone's life on the battlefield, including their own.<LF><LF>Boar Masters use trained boars to savage their enemies. They also love fire, sometimes setting their boars ablaze for added amusement.

Keep him at a distance

Id: [0x002D6BE5]
Macbeth

Id: [0x002D6BE6]
Tribal leaders who dominate the battlefield with incredible range and aggressive combat.<LF><LF>When desperate, they drink an energy potion. But that potion is also poisonous and steadily kills the drinker, which is pretty ironic if you think about it.<LF><LF>But these warlords are willing to make that fatal bargain.

Banneret

A canny fighter, the Banneret observes you and infuriatingly alters his moves accordingly.<LF><LF>He also fancies himself a bit of a leader and will command nearby Saxon Archers to loose devastating volleys of arrows.

Id: [0x002D6BED]

Defeat the wolf first

Follow Fulke to the clifftop

Id: [0x002D6C04]
Randvi

Id: [0x002D6C05]
Randvi's love for her husband Sigurd takes the same form as most in the Raven Clan know --admiration from a distance. Given the number of times Sigurd has spent traveling during their arranged marriage, the two are still strangers in many ways. But Randvi is, at her core, a pragmatic woman who knows from her people's harsh history that there are far worse fates than a utilitarian marriage.

Id: [0x002D6C06]
Gunnar

Id: [0x002D6C07]
Gunnar the blacksmith has a special fondness for Eivor, having been orphaned himself but at a much younger age. The people of Heillboer became his new extended family, and after Varin's death, he carried that love of community to Fornburg. Now, well into his adult years, he yearns for a more immediate family he can call his own.

Id: [0x002D6C08]
Dag

Id: [0x002D6C09]
As the toughest and strongest of young Prince Sigurd's playmates, Dag was certain of his destiny. When the prince became king, he would be Sigurd's right hand.<LF><LF>Then Eivor's village was razed and everything changed. When King Styrbjorn adopted Eivor, Dag knew things would never be the same with his oldest and best friend, but the Fates can turn anyone's luck.

Id: [0x002D6C0A]
Valka

Id: [0x002D6C0B]
Valka has always lived apart from society. But this daughter of a seer (or "volva") was never welcomed or greeted with the same sense of hope and dread that her mother evoked. At least, not until she inherited that title and the generations of lore that went with it.<LF><LF>She cannot yet see as far as her mother once did, but she knows enough to understand that her thread is intimately intertwined with Eivor's.

Id: [0x002D6C0C]
Hytham

Id: [0x002D6C0D]
When Hytham's world fell apart, the Hidden Ones offered him purpose. Now, he finds himself on an uncertain voyage with his mentor Basim, fulfilling the duties of his creed. He knows he will never match Basim as a Hidden One, but he in certain he can be of great use to his Brotherhood, if only given the right chance.

Id: [0x002D6C0E]
Styrbjorn

Id: [0x002D6C0F]
King Styrbjorn of the Raven Clan, last of the Rygjafylke petty kings, did not rise to power rashly but through careful planning. Now, the very virtue that earned him his crown is being challenged by friend, foe, and family.

Id: [0x002D6C10]
Harald

Id: [0x002D6C11]
To call Harald ambitious is like saying that Norway is a bit rocky. In a land where petty kingdoms rise and fall with the tides, Harald has the pedigree and army to back up his aspirations for a unified nation.<LF><LF>King Harald--called "Fair-hair" in his later years--was the son of Halfdan the Black, so named for his own dark head of hair. Clearly, this was a family that knew style was an intimate cousin of substance.

Id: [0x002D6C12]
Soma

Id: [0x002D6C13]
While many young Vikings joined the Great Heathen Army, few rose its ranks. Soma was one of the exceptions.<LF><LF>The young Sami woman was seen as something of a little sister to Ubba and Guthrum. Her savvy for war and trade made her the perfect Jarlskona for the trading hub of Grantebridge.

Id: [0x002D6C14]
Galinn

Id: [0x002D6C15]
Prophecy was a serious affair to Norse and Danish pagans, but Galinn was the sort who would consult a seer on what to have for breakfast. His fighting savvy and flair for politics made him a worthy ally of Soma of Grantebridge when he wasn't off munching magic mushrooms and talking to puddles of rain.

Id: [0x002D6C16]
Birna

Id: [0x002D6C17]
What motivates a Viking? Glory? Valhalla? For Birna, such goals were dreary. She was more pirate than Viking at heart, preferring money, wenches and ale as motivators. Meeting Soma gave her a change in priorities. Many wondered if her adoration of the magnetic leader would sour into hate after Soma's rejection.

Id: [0x002D6C18]
Lif

Id: [0x002D6C19]
Boatbuilding and poetry were both arts greatly respected by the Vikings. Mastery of verse and travel made Lif an asset to Soma's band. He rose in her ranks for his strengths, and she kept a deaf ear to his grumbling about her leadership.

Id: [0x002D6C1A]
Fulke

Id: [0x002D6C1B]
Fragmentary records indicate that Fulke's origins were in Flanders during a time of political upheaval and Viking raids. She is an enigmatic figure who more fully emerges in the historical record in England where she appears as a mixture of gnostic mystic and paladin.<LF><LF>Any young Flemish woman would aspire to that combination: paladin by day, gnostic mystic when evening falls.<LF><LF>She proved to be a thorn in the side of both the religious and secular authorities of the day. Records of her work in England is largely due to surviving references in the journal entries of a defrocked priest known only as Paul.

Id: [0x002D6C1C]
Halfdan

Id: [0x002D6C1D]
Arguably the greatest son of the already-great Ragnar Lothbrok. Halfdan led the vast heathen army that sacked London, conquered York, and extorted every petty king from Exeter to Hadrian's Wall. If that doesn't buy you a round in Valhalla, what will? He had bested everyone, yet still he brooded and raged, unable to enjoy his ill-gotten riches.

Id: [0x002D6C1E]
Faravid

Id: [0x002D6C1F]
Faravid was a skilled Norse leader who followed Halfdan across the sea to England, aiding him at every step in his greatest conquests. He also embodied the curse of the loyal lieutenant, always overshadowed by his bigger, brasher master. Yet Faravid faithfully followed every order, waiting for his day in the sun.

Id: [0x002D6C20]
Ricsige

Id: [0x002D6C21]
Possessed of a sly and calculating nature, King Ricsige of Northumbria had luck enough to land himself into royalty. He lorded over Jorvik, a city rife with greed. But he was never truly comfortable as king, not with Halfdan's strings yanking at his elbows. Still, knowing the fate that had befallen his predecessors, he felt the best idea was to simply wait … and let nature run its course.

Id: [0x002D6C22]
Geadric

Id: [0x002D6C23]
Born into a hardscrabble Oxenefordscire family, Geadric proved himself an able soldier and was described by the Ealdorman of Oxenefordscire as "determined and unwavering." He was awarded a plot of land and the title of thegn.<LF><LF>Similar, I suppose, to being given a blue ribbon and extra pudding upon completion of one's A-levels.

Id: [0x002D6C24]
Eadwyn

Id: [0x002D6C25]
Eadwyn brought considerable financial heft to her marriage with the Ealdorman of Oxenefordscire. When the Ealdorman was killed defending against a Viking raiding party, Eadwyn tried to secure continued control of the shire using her loyal army.<LF><LF>The woman had moxie, you have to give her that.

Id: [0x002D6C26]
Ceolbert

Id: [0x002D6C27]
Ceolbert was the son of Ceolwulf II. He was a young lord who found himself embroiled in his father's political affairs during the Danish army's attack on Mercia. Ceolwulf was to become king, and any king desires a rightful heir. <LF><LF>But this greenhorn wouldn't have lasted a day without some education. So it was that Ceolbert befriended our dear Eivor and set out to earn his stripes.

Id: [0x002D6C28]
Ceolwulf II

Id: [0x002D6C29]
Ceolwulf II was a king's thegn, or noble, who is believed to have belonged to the C dynasty of Mercian kings. He served in King Burgred's court during the Danish invasion of Mercia, but like many nobles during this time, defected from the king's side when the going got tough, i.e. when the Danes started winning.<LF><LF>Ceolwulf was looking to make the best out of a bad situation, and most likely had the support of nobles who didn't want to die. So, he made a pact with the Danes to make him king, a move he hoped would spare his kingdom of their wrath. Talk about a back-alley rise to the top.

Id: [0x002D6C2A]
Leofrith

Id: [0x002D6C2B]
Leofrith rose to the rank of Mercia's war-thegn throughout King Burgred's reign. He was a strategist and a tactician, and the guiding hand behind the king's victories.<LF><LF>He later led Mercia's army against the Danes when they came for its throne, but by that point, he had lost his king's faith after failing to protect the city of Repton.<LF><LF>Time and time again, there's always one loyal soldier who never gets any credit and shoulders all the blame for the mistakes of his idiot leader.

Id: [0x002D6C2C]
Burgred

Id: [0x002D6C2D]
King Burgred took the throne of Mercia in 852 CE and began his reign by subjugating the Welsh with the help of the West Saxons. In 865, the Danes first arrived in Mercia and made their presence known by occupying Nottingham two years later.<LF><LF>With most of the neighboring kingdoms licking their own wounds, no one would come to Mercia's aid this time. Burgred paid the Danes off, but they would return in 874 with a desire for the throne that no bribe could satisfy.

Id: [0x002D6C2E]
Rhodri

Id: [0x002D6C2F]
Rhodri ap Merfyn became King of Gwenydd in 844 CE. Through marriage to Angharad ferch Meurig, Rhodri expanded his kingdom to largely comprise modern-day Wales, giving him the title King of the Britons.<LF><LF>Wedding gift: Wales!<LF><LF>More important than the territorial increase, however, was the political intelligence that Angharad brought to the marriage. Together, Rhodri and Angharad formed a unified and savvy leadership over expansive holdings surrounded by hostile forces. A canny warrior, Rhodri fought against both Mercians and Vikings (he bested Ivarr the Boneless in an early encounter). He would eventually become known as Rhodri Mawr--"Rhodri the Great."

Id: [0x002D6C30]
Deorlaf

Id: [0x002D6C31]
Brought up in an orphanage, Deorlaf's calm and careful demeanor led him to devote his life to religion, eventually becoming a much-respected priest. During the prolonged war with the Britons, Deorlaf served as interim ealdorman until Ceolwulf of Mercia's son could be installed.

Id: [0x002D6C32]
Angharad

Id: [0x002D6C33]
Angharad of Seisyllwg was tutored by scholars from Cor Tewdws as a girl. She married Rhodri ap Merfyn in the mid-9th century, significantly expanding his kingdom. Although the marriage was political, the two formed a strong bond. She calmed Rhodri's impetuous nature with her measured thoughtfulness.

Id: [0x002D6C34]
Cynon

Id: [0x002D6C35]
Cynon was Ealdorman of Glowecestrescire for twenty years at the end of the ninth century. He was lauded for appeasing both the Christians of the former kingdom of Hwicce and the remaining pagans. Cynon's passing of the torch created fear and skepticism, many believing war would spark without him.

Id: [0x002D6C36]
Tewdwr

Id: [0x002D6C37]
The line between church and state has always been thin, but for Tewdwr it was his life. The lad meant to enter the service of the church, but was tapped to lead Glowecestre instead. Like all young men, he was inexperienced and easily misled by the agendas of others.

Id: [0x002D6C38]
Modron

Id: [0x002D6C39]
Glowecestrescire was home to Arthurian legends. Such legends of spoke of Nimue, the Lady of The Lake. It was said that her followers could access ancient power. They worshiped the pagan gods of old. Modron, a powerful healer and witch with a gift for prophecy, was one such follower.

Id: [0x002D6C3A]
Gwenydd

Id: [0x002D6C3B]
Childhood was a blessed period for Gwenydd. The young girl was set to follow her mother's path as a high priestess of Glowecestrescire. She spent much of her time playing in the woods. It was said the girl's father was the spirit of the forest, himself, the pagan god, Cernunnos.

Id: [0x002D6C3C]
Stowe

Id: [0x002D6C3D]
Despite his humble birth, Stowe grew into the pride of Lunden. His love of boxing and justice led him from the cloth to reevehood. He saw the ruling of Lunden as a family, with Tryggr at the head as father, Avgos as a brother, and Erke as something unlike either.

Id: [0x002D6C3E]
Erke

Id: [0x002D6C3F]
Erke Bodilsson was one of Lunden's Danish sons. His motto was, "whatever gets the job done" but shifted from more shady dealings to strictly upholding the law with guidance from Reeve Stowe. The two became fast friends and partners under the rule of Governor Tryggr and could scarcely be seen apart.

Id: [0x002D6C44]
Kjotve

Id: [0x002D6C45]
Long is the list of warriors lost to the bloody clan wars that ravaged Rygafylke, but few will be remembered with the same fear and loathing as Kjotve the Cruel.<LF><LF>Kjotve's rise to prominence from a relatively insignificant clan was fast and brutal. Some have said he was helped by secret, distant allies, but those voices were quickly silenced.<LF><LF>He privately wonders whether his son, Gorm, will prove too weak to take Rygafylke himself and so is determined to beat the land into submission before his final day.

Id: [0x002D6C46]
Ljufvina Bjarmasdotter

Id: [0x002D6C47]
A princess hailing from Bjarmeland. Unlike her husband, Hjorr Halfsson, Ljufvina did not take to the life of politics and the comfort of coin. Despite her differences in appearance and roots, she remained fierce and relentless. A true Viking princess, indeed.

Id: [0x002D6C48]
Hjorr

Id: [0x002D6C49]
Once a member of western Norway's leading royal dynasty, Hjorr left his homeland after King Harald claimed dominion over all kingdoms. Traveling to England, Hjorr soon sat on the king's council in Jorvik. Though his name means "sword," he was more often armed with bags of coin in those days, the weapon of choice on the battlefield of politics.

Id: [0x002D6C4A]
Vili

Id: [0x002D6C4B]
Vili Hemmingson was a beast on the battlefield with a bold and pleasing personality to match. Since settling in Snotinghamscire, however, this jarl's son has carried around the heavy burden of living up to his great father's legacy. I do not envy the man.

Id: [0x002D6C4C]
Hemming

Id: [0x002D6C4D]
Hemming Jarl was a natural and charismatic leader. He was Halfdan's bulwark in their fight against the Picts. With great effort, Hemming united the Saxons and Norse and created peace in his time. The challenge was for those who followed to fill his rather large and jarl-worthy shoes.

Id: [0x002D6C4E]
Trygve

Id: [0x002D6C4F]
Trygve, right hand of Hemming Jarl and father figure to Vili Hemmingson. Loyal to a fault, this old geezer ran a tight ship for Hemming Jarl in his stewardship over Hemthorpe. If only he lived his life for himself a little more instead of others.

Id: [0x002D6C50]
Hunwald

Id: [0x002D6C51]
An earnest boy and the son of Lincolnscire's ealdorman, Hundbeorht, Hunwald was a man deeply proud of his relation to the former kings of Lindsay, a small kingdom recently absorbed by Mercia. A list of the former Kings of Lindsey, written by King Offa, survives in the Anglian Chronicle of Kings. These kings claim lineage with the god Woden. Yes, Woden, the Germanic All-father, akin to Odin.<LF><LF>But does anyone really care? Oh, you bet! Hunwald sure does. If you will it, you can find a kingdom in a grain of sand.

Id: [0x002D6C52]
Acha

Id: [0x002D6C53]
The abbess Acha is a stoic woman who has devoted her life to the service of the Lord. Bereft of humor or levity, she has more in common with the stone walls of Lincoln than the people who live behind them.<LF><LF>Abbesses were common during the Anglo-Saxon era, and due to the inherently male-dominated world, we are not too clear on how powerful they truly were. There are records of the Abbess Sexburgha, Aeffe, and Hilda. Their roles were like most Christians, to serve an abbey, a diocese, and their God.

Id: [0x002D6C54]
Herefrith

Id: [0x002D6C55]
Bishop Herefrith of Lincolnscire worshipped in a small parish in the village of Louth. He was part of the diocese of Lindsey, which was used to refer to Lincolnscire often in historical texts. Herefrith is a friend of Hunwald and worked closely with his father.<LF><LF>I mean, they didn't often share a pint, I imagine. But they shared the odd laugh now and again.

Id: [0x002D6C56]
Aelfgar

Id: [0x002D6C57]
A local Mercian noble of considerable wealth, Aelfgar is a thegn from Gainsborough and a friend of Hunwald's family. Well known as a haughty and superficial man, he has been surprisingly successful in matters of money and influence, though it is unclear how he came into such easy success.

Id: [0x002D6C58]
Rued

Id: [0x002D6C59]
Rued was the jarl of a clan of Dane raiders who came to East Anglia to loot and pillage. He was a nasty bit of work, the sort who might enjoy drinking mead from an enemy's skull. Still, the bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?

Id: [0x002D6C5A]
Brothir and Broder

Id: [0x002D6C5B]
Oafish Danes with much to prove, Brothir and Broder appeared rude and obnoxious at first glance. But they were just looking out for their clan and their sister, making sure her groom-to-be had what it took to be king in the war-torn lands of East Anglia.

Id: [0x002D6C5C]
Oswald

Id: [0x002D6C5D]
Oswald was a thegn of Norfulc, a noble title under the King of East Anglia, much like later barons and earls. After some convincing, he offered himself as the next King of East Anglia--a bold proposition considering the Danes had turned the last few kings into pincushions. An earnest and honest man, Oswald was the perfect man to drink of the cup of power without getting too drunk.

Id: [0x002D6C5E]
Valdis

Id: [0x002D6C5F]
The future queen of East Anglia, Valdis was not just another pretty pawn in the political games of men. This Dane warrior ran her clan in spite of the incompetence of her brothers Brothir and Broder, and the meddling of other warlords.

Id: [0x002D6C60]
Finnr

Id: [0x002D6C61]
Looking at Finnr, you wonder what Halfdan was thinking, leaving the fate of East Anglia in the hands of this mess of a man. He was the long-suffering steward of East Anglia, a place where it seemed impossible to successfully seat a king. A little muddled and lost at times, he never gave up.

Id: [0x002D6C62]
Cynebert

Id: [0x002D6C63]
A Centish abbot who wielded considerable power over his shire, notable to history for his ambition and willingness to leverage religion in pursuit of political power and personal gain. Not exactly the first time that kind of thing has happened, and it certainly won't be the last.

Id: [0x002D6C64]
Birstan

Id: [0x002D6C65]
Birstan was an ealdorman of Essexe in the 9th century, married to Frankish nobility in order to cement a cross-channel alliance. A keen huntsman and, apparently, a hopeless romantic, he was also a prolific writer, although I should say his enthusiasm far outstripped his talent in that regard.

Id: [0x002D6C66]
Estrid

Id: [0x002D6C67]
Estrid was a Frankish lady of noble birth who was married at a young age to Birstan, Ealdorman of Essexe, by her father. Though she was by all accounts witty, beautiful, and intelligent, her diaries show Birstan was more interested in spending time with his hunting hounds than his wife.

Id: [0x002D6C68]
Alfida

Id: [0x002D6C69]
An obscure figure in history, Alfida was a peasant woman notable for being the childhood sweetheart of Birstan, Ealdorman of Essexe. She is known to us mostly from the letters and diaries Birstan left behind for those scholars daring enough to plough through his purple prose and overblown similes.

Id: [0x002D6C6A]
Rollo

Id: [0x002D6C6B]
We know of Rollo first as a hot-headed youth that sailed from Norway to England during the latter stages of the Viking invasion. There he made a small reputation for himself, but history does not take proper account of him until much later, after his early promise was fulfilled in spectacular style in Francia--the land now known as France.<LF><LF>Not known to be short on arrogance, it would no doubt have pleased him to know that while many of his heroes have been relegated to the history books, there are statues of him standing today in both Europe and America.

Id: [0x002D6C6C]
Guthrum

Id: [0x002D6C6D]
Guthrum was one of the most prominent leaders of the Great Heathen Army. After taking land in Mercia and Northumbria, Guthrum turned his ambitions to Wessex, where he became King Aelfred's most persistent enemy.<LF><LF>A skillful tactician as well as a fearsome warrior in his own right, Guthrum exemplified the hit-and-run, guerilla warfare mentality of the invaders, which allowed them to win so many early victories against the slower, more disorganized Anglo-Saxon fyrds. Through a combination of politicking, ransom, and surprise attacks, Guthrum kept his enemies divided while bit by bit, he conquered their lands.

Id: [0x002D6C6E]
Goodwin

Id: [0x002D6C6F]
Goodwin was a reeve of Wincestre and a staunch ally to King Aelfred, working often as his representative or proxy. He was instrumental in helping the king promote and implement his reforms to education and religion in Wessex's most holy city, but history loses track of him soon afterwards.

Id: [0x002D6C70]
Hyrrokin

Id: [0x002D6C71]
Hyrrokin is an evasive figure in Norse mythology, only appearing once at the funeral of Baldr. She arrived riding a giant wolf with twisted serpents for a bridle, then proceeded to shove the funeral ship into the water with such force that the earth quaked and the rollers beneath it set on fire.<LF><LF>The lady knows how to make an entrance, you have to give her that.<LF><LF>Curiously, several obscure sources I have come across have mistranslated her name as "She Who Lies In Wait." More than once, in fact. A strange error to make, but perhaps significant?

Id: [0x002D6C72]
Angrboda

Id: [0x002D6C73]
Angrboda has been variously translated as "the one who brings grief," "she who offers sorrow," or "harm-bidder," which ought to give you an idea of what a sparkling ray of sunshine this lady was. Other sources have called her "truth-giver." It was a curse. The truth is sometimes the most harmful thing of all.<LF><LF>This Jotun witch was the mistress of Loki and a formidable sorceress feared throughout Jotunheim. She dwelt in the Iron Wood among her illusions, and Loki visited her often, sneaking away from his home in Asgard to plot and scheme and do other things I'm far too English to mention.

Id: [0x002D6C74]
Odin

Id: [0x002D6C75]
The Hanged-God, Shield-Shaker, Graybeard, and Wanderer are just a few of the many, many names of Odin, the All-Father. Having effectively created the Nine Realms out of the carcass of a dead giant, Odin feels he should be exempt from any binding fate--particularly one that ends in the jaws of a monstrous wolf. His thirst for power through knowledge is unquenchable. He sacrificed an eye for insight and hung himself on the tree Yggdrasil in the father of all near-death experiences.<LF><LF>When not acting in his role as chief among the Norse gods, he wanders the mortal realm (Midgard), often in the form of a bearded old man, wearing a long cloak, a wide hat, and carrying a staff. Classic Odin.

Id: [0x002D6C76]
Loki

Id: [0x002D6C77]
It's hard being the smartest person in the room, especially when no one else will acknowledge it. Of all the Aesir, only Odin has shown a true appreciation for Loki's intelligence, and even then, the All-Father has only ever done so to further his own knowledge-seeking agenda.<LF><LF>As much as he resents his Asgardian overlords, Loki --the son of a Jotun--would prefer see the Aesir be the architects of their own destruction, rather than having to do the heavy lifting himself.

Id: [0x002D6C78]
Thor

Id: [0x002D6C79]
Thor has a somewhat less complicated view of the world than his father, Odin. Power quests and politics have less appeal than the more satisfying activities of eating, drinking, and fighting. Thor is not afraid to die at Ragnarok, for he knows his end will be glorious. He loves his wife, Sif, deeply and will murderously defend her honor at any given opportunity. Sometimes, when bored, he actively seeks out such opportunities.

Id: [0x002D6C7A]
Tyr

Id: [0x002D6C7B]
Tyr was the War Lord of the Aesir until Odin defeated him in a match of martial skills. He deemed the contest honestly won and embraced his new role of loyal lieutenant. Odin rewarded this show of trust by making Tyr his confidant and chief lawgiver.<LF><LF>While he prides himself on his unchallenged reputation as a fair and even-handed judge, Tyr occasionally expresses an intense distrust of the Vanir over reasons he refuses to fully disclose.

Id: [0x002D6C7C]
Freyja

Id: [0x002D6C7D]
Freyja of the Vanir married Odin for largely political reasons, and despite their many disputes and infidelities, a fondness and mutual respect has grown between the two in lieu of love.<LF><LF>Although her acceptance was not unanimous among the Aesir, she is quite comfortable in her role as their queen and enjoys adding more civilized touches to their otherwise war-centered lives. She is particularly pleased with the robust growth of the cat population since her arrival, much to the consternation of Tyr and others.

Id: [0x002D6C7E]
Ivaldi

Id: [0x002D6C7F]
When Ivaldi the dwarf was rescued by Odin from a fate worse than death, his smithing skill was unmatched in the Nine Realms. He pays that debt off as the All-Father's servant, crafting items of great power and beauty. He takes great pride in his work and even greater pride in his sons, whose talents are destined to eclipse his own.

Id: [0x002D6C80]
Gunlod

Id: [0x002D6C81]
Gunlod was the daughter of Suttungr, and helped him guard the magical mead that he took from Fjalar and Galar. She met Odin when he came to steal the mead from her father's vault, but accounts differ as to how the encounter played out after that.<LF><LF>A recently discovered runestone --of dubious provenance, I should add--sheds some light on the conversations between her and Odin. He asks her what she has been doing all the time alone in the vault. Her answer, as best it can be translated, was "calculating."

Id: [0x002D6C82]
Fenrir

Id: [0x002D6C83]
Fenrir is the great wolf prophesized to devour Odin during the battle of Ragnarok. He is the son of Loki, and his siblings are the goddess Hel and Jormungandr, the Midgard Serpent. Despite Odin's effort to find a loophole in the threads of the Fates, events continue to unfold as foretold.

Id: [0x002D6C84]
The Builder

Id: [0x002D6C85]
This crafty character, known only as The Builder, arrives in Asgard at an opportune time. But even gifts from the Fates come with strings attached. If he is so quick to turn on his former associates, the Jotnar, how will he deal with the Aesir?

Id: [0x002D6C86]
Suttungr

Id: [0x002D6C87]
When two treacherous dwarves murdered Suttungr's parents, he set out to avenge them. In exchange for sparing their lives, the dwarves offered him a magical Mead, which he hid in a vault inside the mountain Hnitbjorg. Along with his daughter Gunlod, he guarded it jealously, until one day, Odin came looking for it…<LF><LF>Many legends have a nugget of fact at the heart, even if the tale itself is fantastical. The Mead, in particular, seems a metaphor for something else. Equally, Suttungr may be a representation of some powerful ruler from unrecorded Norse history. Note to self: investigate further.

Id: [0x002D6C88]
Ratatoskr

Id: [0x002D6C89]
In Norse myth, Ratatoskr was a mischievous squirrel that carried slanderous gossip between the serpent Nidhoggr, which dwelt beneath one of the roots of Yggdrasil, and an eagle, which perched at the top.<LF><LF>Reminds me of some people I used to work with, actually. Wonder how Karen's doing these days?

Id: [0x002D6C8A]
The Daughters of Lerion

Id: [0x002D6C8B]
In 864 CE, a wealthy East Anglian Ealdorman named Lerion devised a plan to kill the Mercian king Burgred and install himself on the throne, joining the two kingdoms. It was a foolhardy plan from the start, a scheme complicated by the fact that Lerion was old, his wife was dead, and he had no male heirs. Were he to succeed in his violent plot, his dynasty would hardly endure a decade.<LF><LF>Lerion did, however, have three daughters--Regan, Goneril, and Cordelia--all as wise, as beautiful, and as cunning as their father. The ealdorman loved his daughters with a deep and abiding passion, and they loved him in return. So great was his affection that he wished to bequeath his future kingdom to them in equal portions.<LF><LF>In autumn of that year, with assurances from his allies, Lerion was poised to strike. But King Edmund of East Anglia discovered the plot before it had hatched. Lerion was arrested swiftly and executed for treason. His three daughters, fearing they would suffer their father's fate or worse, fled into the fens of East Anglia and disappeared.<LF><LF>When they reappeared some years later, well … they were miffed.

Id: [0x002D6C8C]
Ragnar Lothbrok

Id: [0x002D6C8D]
Though he has been dead some years before the era we're exploring, Ragnar Lothbrok's influence is present in the form of three of his sons, Halfdan, Ubba, and Ivarr the Boneless.<LF><LF>Ragnar Lothbrok himself was a storied Viking, indeed more legendary deeds are attributed to him than he could possibly have accomplished. Nevertheless, he appears to have been a highly successful Viking, with devastating raids through France, England, and Ireland over two decades.<LF><LF>Lothbrok came to an unpleasant end when King Aella of Northumbria tossed him into a pit of snakes for amusement. The joke, however, was on King Aella, who was later blood-eagled by Ivarr.

Id: [0x002D6C8E]
The Lost Drengir of Ragnar Lothbrok

Id: [0x002D6C8F]
A drengr is a glorious and honorable warrior, one willing to go to the ends of the earth seeking righteous glory. The term can be literally translated as "badass" based on my research. These were the elite and would have stood by Ragnar no matter the circumstance. Now they are somewhat lost, but still crave Valhalla.

Treasure-Seeker's Note

I've heard tales of folks finding treasure in these old ruins. The Romans were great ones for the minting of coins. With a bit of luck, a fellow could find enough to buy a farm and hire help. The town was called Uriconium back then. Strange name, I say. But the Romans weren't out to please me.

Eel Recipe

Id: [0x002D7535]
Scour the eel with small stones from the river bottom. Cut the length of the belly and squeeze out the entrails (these can be used for bait if you use them quick). Wash the eel in the river and set out on a hot stone. Move it around to cook all the bits. If you have an onion, chop it up and put on top. If you have no onion, may the Lord bless you. Cook the eel until it curls up crispy. I like it crispy as can be. Mash some cloves as best you can and scatter them over and about the eel. Drink as much mead as you may while eating.

Dear niece, I fear Rhodri no longer gives you his ear. From your marriage day on, he has listened to your wise counsel and you managed to soften his harsher leanings.

Urgent Report for Rhodri

Id: [0x002D7543]
Relay to the king that his brother Gwriad has been captured by the Danes. It was a sad affair, the man's no fighter. Caught by surprise, he took fright and ran.

I am to be Ealdorman. It came as quite a shock, as I have made my interest in furthering my path in the duty of Christ. The Fathers said that though my heart lies with the cloth here in Winchcombe, the Lord has need of me elsewhere. Heresy, devil worship, and hedonism plagues Glowecestre proper like locusts. I am to be their new shepherd, freeing them from the devil's bondage and leading the good people back to His side. I just hope they will be my willing lambs.

Id: [0x002D7E47]
Letter of Disgruntlement

Id: [0x002D7E48]
Be it known throughout all Oxenefordscire: Lady Eadwyn, widow of our revered ealdorman, assumes all his rights, obligations, privileges, and powers. Henceforth, address and obey her as befits her state.

Id: [0x002D7E49]
Our dear ealdorman has been laid to rest. Shriven, anointed and shrouded in a simple cloth, his earthly remains have been buried in sanctified ground, his noble head positioned toward the setting sun.

Id: [0x002D7E4A]
We are unprepared for the sudden loss of our dear ealdorman. Our thegns are disorganized and bicker in petty disputes. I fear someone will take control without consent of the shire.

Id: [0x002D7E4B]
It is as I foretold. Someone has seized the lead of the shire, but I could not have foreseen the widow of our fallen ealdorman would be so bold. Her soldiers are everywhere, her taxes no less so.

Letter to the Judge

In the memory of our honored saint, please send these people away.<LF><LF>-Your parishioners

Abbot Dalberre,<LF><LF>Doubtless, your duties have consumed your attention, otherwise you would have noted that Brother Timothy has taken more than his portion of porridge three times running.<LF><LF>I take no pleasure in denouncing the cherished brother, but if this persists, I cannot answer for the vengeance that our Lord will certainly wreck upon Timothy.<LF><LF>For, are we not all instruments of the Lord? And am I not the simple vessel of the Lord's will? If I were to upend a pot of piss into Timothy's stupid sleeping mouth, would not my hand be the hand of the Lord?<LF><LF>-Brother Als

Abbot Dalberre,<LF><LF>I pray for Brother Als' soul daily. The man is consumed by covetousness! Twice I have found him wearing my leather sandals, made by my uncle's own hand.

Proclamation Concerning Fulke

Id: [0x002D7E83]
Brothers,<LF><LF>I caution each of you to resist engaging in ecclesiastical debate with the prisoner called Fulke. She has Lucifer's ability to turn one's words--and even holy scripture--back upon one, making the speaker appear foolish and unlearned.<LF><LF>We must not let her indulge in these dark arts. Restrict conversation to the subjects of food, weather, and praise of Lady Eadwyn.<LF><LF>Dalberre, Abbot

The Magas Codex, Page I

Id: [0x002D811C]
On a typical day of study and training, as a departure from our usual routine, Master Hakor welcomed a guest to our Alexandrian Bureau. A taut woman with a stoic expression, she seemed to be in the later years of her fifth decade. She entered the hall with feathered steps and sat at the head of the room in silence for quite some time as Master Hakor delivered a vague introduction of this unknown figure. Throughout his speech, the woman never once glanced upon him, but swept her eyes across the acolytes seated before her, among whom I counted myself.<LF><LF>When at last Master Hakor stepped aside, the woman stood and opened with a blunt statement.<LF><LF>"If nothing is true," she said, "this statement must also be false."<LF><LF>The woman left her words hanging in the air. After a long and puzzled silence, a keen acolyte called Magas offered a reply.<LF><LF>"The Creed itself is an irony. It suggests that the world cannot be broken into truths and falsehoods, facts and fictions."<LF><LF>"Yes," the woman replied. "The world merely is. It exists, and we are but a small part of its wholeness."<LF><LF>"But to exist is to be true, no? A thing that exists is a thing we call a fact."<LF><LF>"To exist is to exist," the woman countered. "Truths and facts are valuations. Acts, not objects."<LF><LF>Magas fell silent, and the woman continued.<LF><LF>"If everything is permitted, who gives this permission?"

Id: [0x002D811D]
The Magas Codex, Page II

Id: [0x002D811E]
Another silence. Magas opened his mouth, inhaled, and shut it without speaking.<LF><LF>"We gift this permission to ourselves," the woman said. "We are the source of our own purpose."<LF><LF>None said a word in reply as the woman looked us over. It seemed that she was neither pleased nor dissatisfied with our silence. Then she began pacing the room, slowly, turning about and looking around our hidden hall with an expression that verged on nostalgia or satisfaction.<LF><LF>"With this knowledge," she continued, "with this understanding comes a great and terrible freedom. The freedom to rise or fall, to live or die, by your own volition. This is why our Creed cuts as cleanly as a double-edged sword. You must take this paradox to heart. The success or failure of our Brotherhood depends on your willingness to live in the unfeeling emptiness of this world, as if lost in Tartarus, alone and hopeless, yet bearing a hope that a door will one day open and let in the light. And that you shall exit, not alone, but with all your brothers and sisters at your side."<LF><LF>The woman stopped for a moment to run her hand over a dilapidated stony pillar. She seemed to be reliving an old or half-forgotten memory. Catching herself, she stepped away and continued.<LF><LF>"Because they were with you all along, your brothers and sisters, beside you in the shadows, you walked in the darkness in silence, but you were never alone."

The Magas Codex, Page III

Id: [0x002D8120]
"Yet to see the last light, you must first feel the loss, the emptiness, the pain. And you must act always with the belief that you have failed, that you will fail again, that you must always fail. This is the way of the Hidden Ones. To fail better than you have before. We wander in the dark ever searching for the light."<LF><LF>She then paused and drew a great breath.<LF><LF>"But here I must contradict myself. For although the nature of reality is empty and unknowable, the nature of our work is not. And for this Brotherhood to succeed, we must have tenets by which we may judge our success. Hard, cold rules. Truths by which we swear."<LF><LF>A faint murmur rushed through the gathered acolytes at the realization of what was happening. The Final Codification, long rumored, was now upon us. The woman spoke again, with more gravity than before.<LF><LF>"Since the twilight of the Ptolemies, the Hidden Ones have served to break the unnatural shackles that man puts upon man. And we have done so in a manner consistent with our Creed, yet this has often led to confusion and chaos. Thus have we devised a set of three tenets, borne from rigorous practice and application, to lead us to greater success."<LF><LF>"One," she began, "Hide in plain sight, that your success may come in view of all, yet swiftly and without forewarning."<LF><LF>"Two, never compromise the Brotherhood. Be thoughtful in act and speech, for it is the only sure way to protect ourselves from outside influence and keep our motives uncorrupted."

"And three, stay your blade from the flesh of an innocent. Only those with active malice in their hearts need answer for their cruelty. The unwilling pawns of evil and the bystanders caught in their wake do not deserve the sting of our steel."<LF><LF>"This is the decree of the Hidden Ones. Three tenets, together with the Creed, to define our path forward. Only these and nothing more. To encumber ourselves further would only dilute our resolve."<LF><LF>Here Magas spoke again, most ardently now. "Yet, if nothing is true, how can we justify such strictures? Should we not be free to pursue our goal in whatever fashion we see fit?"<LF><LF>"You feel this is a fatal irony?" the woman asked.<LF><LF>"I only wonder at the contradiction," Magas said. "From what authority do these tenets derive?"<LF><LF>"We are Hidden Ones, a title we gave ourselves. And we gave ourselves a goal, the physical and spiritual liberation of man. These are self-made ambitions. To achieve them, therefore, we need laws to guide us. There is no magic in these words, no appeal to a higher authority. We follow them only because they help us achieve what we ourselves have defined. These laws, they allow us to persist. The effectiveness of any tenet must be judged on the outcome of its practice."<LF><LF>She grew silent for a moment, looked at Master Hakor, then back at us.<LF><LF>"Let it be known and recorded; these are the conclusions of the final Synod of the Hidden Ones. There will not be another. Today the shadow falls, now and for all time, to obscure us forevermore. Let our work continue only in the dark."

Id: [0x002D8124]
"Work in silence from this day forward. Speak not your names, nor the names of your family and friends. For to do so would be a deadly compromise and a useless gesture. Seek not recognition, nor glory, nor compensation for your duty. Seek only the light, however dimly it may flicker upon the horizon."<LF><LF>Pausing, the woman smiled slightly. For the first time since her arrival she seemed content.<LF><LF>"We are Hidden Ones, all of us, forever together in our solitude. May it ever be so."<LF><LF>She stopped there, gave a slight nod, and turned and strode towards the exit at the back of the hall, making no sound as she went. The room stayed silent for a time, until Master Hakor broke the peace by urging us to our afternoon studies. Euclid was the subject this day, and amid a rustle of scrolls, the acolytes set to work.<LF><LF>Some hours later, I found myself in the garden outside the tomb of Alexander Rex, enjoying a bowl of dates and thinking on the lessons of the day, and of the woman who had given us so much to ponder. So deep in thought was I, that I did not notice the arrival of Magas, who startled me with a touch on the shoulder.<LF><LF>"Quite a day, was it not?" he said, excitedly, "To be visited by such a one?"

Id: [0x002D8125]
The Magas Codex, Page VI

Id: [0x002D8126]
Mistaking my inquiring expression for censure, Magas waved his hands before him.<LF><LF>"I know, I know," he said. "Glory and recognition are frowned upon. Our anonymity is our weapon. But allow me this one moment of glee. For to meet one of our founders, the woman who ended the Ptolemies no less … it is not a chance we shall have again."<LF><LF>"A founder," I repeated. "Of the Hidden Ones? Her?"<LF><LF>"Yes, O, yes, Magas said. Her true name is lost to the living, as are the names of all our first Hidden Ones. A testament to their devotion, I suppose! But a woman this colored and stained by history cannot live invisible in her own time. She has seen the blood of Caesar, the tears of Cleopatra, and the wrath of Imperator Augustus no less!"<LF><LF>Magas leaned in close so that only I amid the drifting bees and butterflies would hear.<LF><LF>"She would kill me for speaking her name, but I'll say it! Amunet they called her, a long time ago. And today, for a moment, she lived not in memory but in flesh. As for the rest, they are gone … and happier for it, I think."

Id: [0x002D8127]
A warning, my beloved.<LF><LF>I have heard numerous tales now of a secret codex circulating among the acolytes of our bureaus, both within and without the empire of Augustus. Called the Magas Codex, it names you directly as one of the founders of the Hidden Ones.<LF><LF>Apart from putting your life in danger, it flies in the face of what we have tried to achieve with our brotherhood. We are justice seekers who shun the light of praise for our good works, and who must live in the shadows of our triumphs. Should you see any pages of this codex, I advise you to destroy them. Keep the dream of our Hidden Ones alive.<LF><LF>I am not so naïve to think this will be a simple task. Few men and women are suited to keeping such secrets for so long, and it may be that we will fail in the end. But we will have failed in the name of righteousness.<LF><LF>Take care, my love, my Iset, my Northern Star. Even in my waning years, I am ever your Osiris. Let our Horus live on beyond us. I think of you often, my jewel. At sunrise and twilight, at new moon and full, when the rain falls and the breath of Amun rides across my neck. I remember you kissing me just there, and I will take that soft feeling to my tomb.<LF><LF>The Hidden One

But that is not quite true.<LF><LF>In some ways, we are to blame. For years we have scratched at the pillars of empire, toppling one or two when the foundation seemed too strong, and the weight of any one Caesar's ambitions seemed too pressing. <LF><LF>But there is a limit to how many supports a building may lose before it topples to the ground. We might have been more careful. We might have been more selective, more cautious in our approach to liberty. But we have helped free Britannia of all structure, and now the roof has collapsed. <LF><LF>A dark age is coming. The burden now falls upon a future generation to bring back the light. How soon that will be, I cannot say. And I dare not hope.<LF><LF>M.V.

The pagans ordered King Edmund to renounce God and all that is holy. But even beaten, bound, and bludgeoned, our lord held fast to his faith. Our monarch bid them do their worst, for he would not bend to their will. With their cruel barbs, the heathens martyred him in this place.

Aric! Rued claims we took treasure from our last raid but denied him his rightful share. You know we found nothing! Those Saxon farmers must have stashed it. Find it, before Rued exiles us … or worse. One of the farmers spoke of an underground vault, but he … did not survive my questioning. Find this vault, Aric, before Rued finds us.

Sailor's Last Log

Id: [0x002D864E]
This is how I die? Alone, stranded, left for dead on a ship that is now naught but driftwood. By the hand of other Odin-sons. The sails are torn, the sharks circle, and I will die a hapless fool, denied a glorious death of battle. The Valkyries ride not for me … already the cold draft of Niflheim chills my face as its gates open. May you die a cursed death, Rued, so that my men and I may meet you in Hel, axes and sticks in hand.

Herleif! Someone has stolen the offerings from Cedd's Stone again. I finally spotted them! Green shadows flitting through the thick of the brush.

I leave this to you, none that desecrate our god-shrines shall go unpunished.

Legend speaks of treasure in these caves. The same legend may have brought you here, too. I survived with my sanity, but only just. Now hearken to my words. No treasure is worth your immortal soul.

A cryptic sound file, voice unknown, with a signal beneath it. The signal was a code. Led us to a precise spot here in New England. We dug, and good Lord, we struck gold. (Well, silver. Dominant currency in the dark ages.)<LF><LF>Point is, it was a gravesite. A Norse warrior, dating to the late 9th century, early 10th century AD. A few centuries before the earliest known settlements. This is big news if we have it right.<LF><LF>Questions remain: How did these bones get here? And why?

Layla has located a new Isu Temple, the Yggdrasil chamber, for lack of a better term. She is there now, searching for a way to slow it down and return the world to some sense of normalcy. Many pieces now fall into place and a theory emerges: In 2012 Desmond Miles managed to activate a network of Isu temples and devices in such a way that it amplified the earth's magnetic field, one that shielded us from the mass coronal ejection that should have dealt civilization a fatal blow. But in the 8 years that have passed, it appears this magnetic field has been growing ever stronger, and now the cure to what ailed us becomes the disease. The magnetic field that saved us threatens us all over again. But what is driving this increase? This Yggdrasil machine--a simulation device not unlike our animus, but perhaps fed on calculations, not memories--seems to be in an "overclocked" state, for lack of a better term. What is the cause of this?<LF><LF>Only Layla can tell us for sure. So many questions. I eagerly await her return.

Id: [0x002D8ADC]
Must send a team to excavate at the settlement location discovered through Layla's simulation--river Nene, near modern Leicestershire. Will we find bodies, grave goods, evidence of war? Plenty of precedent to go on here. Most towns in England ending with -thorpe and -by were founded by Norse warriors. Even York comes from Jorvik, a Norse mutation of Eoforwic.<LF><LF>Evolution works at all levels, on humans, on language. We know that the language of the settling Norse was a close cousin of the Old English spoken by the Saxons. In this way, they were mutually intelligible, in the most basic ways at least. This would account for the rapid success of the Norse when conquering and integrating with the locals.<LF><LF>Shower thought: If the Americans still spoke English, they could invade the UK with similar success.

Id: [0x002D8ADD]
AKA Aelfred Rex, Aelfred the Great. What do we know about him? Famous for his holy vision of uniting all the Kingdoms of England, one country under one rule. Sort of a United Nations of England maybe. Or just England.<LF><LF>He never saw this vision come to fruition, though he laid the foundation for it. Too busy fighting Vikings. Strangely, Shakespeare never wrote a play about Alfred and the Vikings. Missed opportunity, that. "Now is the summer of our peace and calm / Made clamorous winter by this loon of Jorvik."

Id: [0x002D8ADE]
Eivor has spent quite a lot of time with Basim now, and together with Hytham, it gives us a clearer picture of the Hidden Ones in the 9th century. They are recognizable as assassins in all but name, which makes me think they evolved quite naturally into what we know from Altair's time. The word Assassin comes from the Arabic word for "Hash-Smokers." It may be the Hidden Ones adopted this epithet as a mark of pride more than anything. Turning an insult into a mark of pride.<LF><LF>Curiously, I do remember one passing reference in some of the old literature about Hytham being one of the first Assassins back in England after the exodus around 430 AD. I should contact our London Bureau for Edward Kenway's papers. Had he read about this early assassin? Is that why he named his son as he did? It seems likely.

Id: [0x002D8ADF]
The more we see of the Order of Ancients, the less they resemble the Templars as we know them today. How did this evolution take place? This older Order was obsessed with our Isu precursors. They worshiped them as gods, aspired to their status and power, and coveted their works and weapons … in the name of Order, yes. But with a very strict hierarchy that placed the Isu well above humankind. Fulke, nicknamed the Instrument, has also wielded that term as an adjective. She believed that humans were deeply flawed, lesser beings, meant to serve. The Templars believe in man, a more admirable approach, I will admit.<LF><LF>Could it be the modern Instruments of the First Will represent some sort of return to the distant past? A revival of a dead order? Did they never truly vanish?

Id: [0x002D8CCB]
Bodilsburg was built by Bodil Bodilsson, one of the three Great Jarls of Lunden. He was a peacekeeper, and for his spinnings and peacekeeping, survived the other jarls of his time. From him came three sons: Bjorn, Erke, and Thor. Sadly he and two of his sons perished of a great sickness.

Another year of early blossoms. Have you sent them from your side? Always the soothsayer in life, I can see you keeping the gods as a captive audience on the other side. Boots has had another litter. We'll be as rich in cats as we were in love. Sleep well, my beast.

Notes on a Mask

Id: [0x002D8CD1]
Despite my hopes, it seems the mask is more myth than fact. A shame, an enchanted item that allows the wearer to pass between the doorways between worlds. I've combed these hills in search, but my stocks are low and my back is sore. See you at home.<LF><LF>-Bran

Dafydd is content with a life of a shepherd, but my gaze goes higher. What is a lord but a man with more gold, more land, and more to lose? Legends tell of riches, artefacts hidden around Glowecestre that could buy more than a plot of land. I will bring back these items: Fae Treasures of Belas Knap, the ring of Silvanus, and who knows what else, and raise us as lords!<LF><LF>-Bran

I would be a liar if I claimed I only laid with Cynon because of his role in the ceremony.<LF><LF>In our debates, I have admired him. The blade of his jaw, the bulge of his arms, the soft hairs on his chest. I made sure to acquaint my hands with what my eyes thirsted for. Knew what he was doing, the old bastard. Recognized me under the mask. Finished the ceremony with my name on his lips.<LF><LF>Gods, I hope I don't love him. That would complicate everything.

BBB Member's Note

Id: [0x002D9435]
I love it here. Rolling around with these lads makes me feel right at home. A good sense of belonging. Companionship.<LF><LF>Do we beat each other until our heads ring? Yes. Do I now have less teeth than fingers? Also, yes. But each brawl, sweaty and agonizing as it may be, always ends with kindness. A hug. A pat on the back. A headbutt. There is nowhere else I would rather be.

Ubba Ragnarsson has banished me from the camp. This comes on the heels of another battle in which I warred far more with my tongue than I did with my axe. It is time to let it lay, he said.<LF><LF>He is right. I no longer wish to fight. To raid. To kill. These things have not enlivened my body or my hugr for many years now. It may be I only needed to hear it from another. For that, I thank the son of Ragnar for bringing to light what I failed to see.<LF><LF>What lies before me now, I do not know. This, I will sit and ponder.

Fighting is in our blood. I have known it all my life. But my brother will never believe it. Even when Mother died, and she revealed the truth about our father, he still denies it.<LF><LF>I remember it so clearly. She lay there, choking on blood after a fierce battle with one of our cows, and plainly said with smoldering eyes, "You are a Ragnarsson." As though deaf, my brother heard "You are a bastard's son." <LF><LF>No. He will see that it is a warrior's life we are best suited for, not a farmer's. I will show him. We are our father's sons.

Another sorry day in my miserable life. It's no joy to drag a stinking corpse and set it just so with sticks and rocks, then hide, hoping, hoping, hoping some drooling ceorl will come along and listen to my tale of purgatory.<LF><LF>Making the voice sound right is no small task. And near every time, they aren't fooled and knock the corpse sideways and I have to start anew.<LF><LF>But then there are the times when they give silver and believe they've saved a soul. They're so happy to have done something good in this sad world. Makes it all worth it, it does.

A Plea for Fairness

Id: [0x002D9762]
The namesake trees of the Hollow Forest have properties unseen elsewhere in the realms. At their core, a solid emptiness that retreats from the eye, then draws near. Like the rise and fall of a down-covered bosom. Would a construct of this wood own these same shifting properties when cut off from their roots?

Id: [0x002D9763]
Father -<LF><LF>Do not lose heart!<LF><LF>Even as you toil away for an ungrateful master, the Great Work goes on. We have mined greater depths than even Yggdrasil's wyrms have known, and still we do not stop.

It grows more challenging to hide you from Odin's sight. We may need to abandon Asgard for one of the lesser realms. You would fare little better under your sister's dominion--she has made that much clear. Midgard is promising, but the barriers greater.<LF><LF>I know not when--or if--you might make sense of these musings. Sharing my thoughts like this helps keep them purposeful and sharp.

Id: [0x002D9767]
Aesir runes are powerful but flawed. Flaws we could turn to our advantage. Learn what you can from the dwarves. They guard their secrets jealously but may open to bribery.<LF><LF>The limits of Vanir magic are still unknown. Poisoning their alliance with the Aesir remains our best strategy.

Id: [0x002D976C]
Havi -<LF><LF>A witness has come forward in the case of Sigerdrifa to support that she was indeed coerced.

Sometimes the ripples from these tiny tragedies can come crashing onto our shores.<LF><LF>- Tyr, Lord of Justice

Fulke's Journal

Id: [0x002D9846]
I throw myself at the strange language that Emperor Louis bade me decipher. Yet all my knowledge of the Ancient Ones and their artifacts falls short of shedding even the thinnest ray of light upon this beautiful script.<LF><LF>Louis tells me these words come from an etching seen and transcribed by a young Palatinus in the days of Charlemagne's oversight. But Louis does not know where in the world the original inscription was discovered. On a temple? A tomb? A slab of rock? Impossible to say.<LF><LF>*<LF><LF>Again and again, I consult the keystone in my possession, searching for correlations between it and the words copied from the etching. Yet nothing obtains. This should not be a surprise. The keystone itself is a mere fragment, brought, I am told, from Norway by the invader Ragnar Lothbrok. For that reason, I call it the Saga Stone. Did he know the true value of the object he carried?<LF><LF>*<LF><LF>A fortuitous discovery! I have come into the possession of a man bearing the mark of the Ancient Ones upon his neck. I tremble at what this could mean. Could he be an Ancient One reborn? Or a child of such a one, designed to make his appearance after so many centuries? I have heard stories of one called Aita reborn. But this man does not have the telltale eyes.<LF><LF>I will do all I can to probe this man for hidden mysteries. And with luck, the language of the ancient ones will open to me.

He could shoot fire out of his eyes, and once he made eggs come back to life because a workman bumped into an old woman on the bridge and they fell and broke.<LF><LF>O, and he makes it rain. Like all the time and is still doing miracles even though he is dead. Amen.

Turgid Text

Id: [0x002D98BB]
In the seventieth year of our Lord's incarnation, the Roman Invaders built a settlement on the very site you are standing now. They called this new town, Venta Belgarum after a local tribe of barbarians named the Belgares. They made this place a center of industry, learning, and culture.<LF><LF>They were Godless heathens then, but the Light of our Lord transformed them in time.

Id: [0x002D98BC]
The last Heathen oppressor left Britain in the year of our Lord 407. Lawlessness ruled. Tribes fought each other for land and wealth and our good town was abandoned, eventually falling to rubble and ruin.

Another night, another good haul with the lads. This time we ambushed a couple of Mercian soldiers from Ledecestre. Burgred's boys. They're well equipped, those buggers. Took what coin they had on them. Their swords. Helms. Even got meself a new pair of trousers because they didn't fit Henbold.<LF><LF>I think I'm starting to fancy this spot. Lots of fresh meat coming through to Grantebridge.

We are men of peace. This is a monastery, not a barracks. Yet this is where Wigmund's men have brought a group of captured Danes. They're keeping them here, shackled and starved. Why bother, I say. Their fates are sealed. Lord Wigmund will order their deaths. Perhaps they mean to torture them. If that is the case, then I am filled with unrest. Nothing frightens me more than a Dane with his back against the wall.

They are endowed with an obedience that I suspect can only be attributed to your wisdom and guidance.<LF><LF>Please, continue sending them my way. It pleases me to speak with such spry young men, eager to learn about the Order of the Ancients. There is much for them to gain and they are welcome to follow this great cause.<LF><LF>Wigmund

Thegn Wimbald,<LF><LF>Your offerings have been quite generous. My men fight well, they sleep well, and they are in good spirits, and it is all because they are well fed. <LF><LF>Their efficiency is key to our victory, so it remains imperative that this partnership continues until the Danish threat is obliterated, for the sake of all who call Grantebridge their home. <LF><LF>Rest assured the Order of the Ancients recognizes your contributions and will see to it that you are adequately rewarded.<LF><LF>Wigmund

The Wall

Id: [0x002D9963]
A wall is better than no wall I suppose, but I cannot see this one stopping so much as a dozen marching ants let alone a wave of pagan invaders. Perhaps they will trip over it, giving us just enough time to stab them while they're down. Sometimes I wonder why I put up with this shire.

I have grown to like the Saxon Lord Aelfgar. It was not always the case. He is bigheaded and speaks more than he needs to, sometimes more than I can bear, but he is a man of good tastes.<LF><LF>Of late, we have gone on hunts together. At first, I thought he might kill me with a stray arrow, but Aelfgar shows good poise with a bow. Took down three boars in one night. Fed me a meal better than anything I've had before.<LF><LF>There is more than meets the eye with this noble, and much to learn.

We were bathing in the water when I heard Hounilda shouting she found treasure. I didn't believe her. She always says things of the sort and then laughs when we fall for it. But I looked, even though I hate opening my eyes underwater. It's true! There is treasure down there.<LF><LF>Hounilda said it was hers because she saw it first. She dove under the water to get it, but she nearly did not come back up! She swallowed water and was coughing, so we took her home.<LF><LF>I'm too scared to try. I cannot hold my breath very long. Maybe when I'm older.

My men are growing weary. They wonder if there is much of a point being here anymore. Can't say I see a fault in their thinking. But here we all remain, bound to duty.<LF><LF>But the wheels are not turning. Lincoln is a shell of its former self. No one comes here. There are no taxes to collect. The naval chain is broken and has remained that way since God knows when. The only thing breathing life into this shire is the bandit groups who leech from it.<LF><LF>How curious.

After conducting several trials we have found that these naval chains will hold against even the most durable Danish longships, so long as the mechanism remains intact. Several more blockades will be constructed in the coming months and are to be installed on the rivers leading inland.<LF><LF>This is our best defense against any forthcoming incursions. It is imperative that these blockades be maintained and kept operational at all times. Any failure of function is to be reported immediately.

I don't like the sound of any of this, Layla. And I don't like where this is leading. "Not using phones" is not the right way to ease my mind.

Layla, as you traipse about England, Becs and I thought you might want to keep your eyes open for a few things.<LF><LF>ASSASSIN BUREAUS<LF>Or the Hidden Ones, more accurately. They operated in Roman Britain between the years 100 and 430 BCE. It's not clear why they left, but the final date corresponds roughly to the Roman exodus from Britain, so I imagine their leaving had something to do with the empire's retreat? Mission accomplished or a loss of faith? Not sure. But we do know that it was several hundred years before the Hidden Ones returned to the island. It may be Basim and Hytham are the first in half a century.<LF><LF>From our own archives, I believe there were six main bureaus operating in the Roman period:<LF><LF>Leicestershire<LF>London<LF>Winchester<LF>York<LF>Essex<LF>Gloucestershire<LF><LF>These won't be the Saxon names, so you'll have to read between lines.<LF><LF>ANIMUS ANOMALIES<LF>Becs noticed these, about ten, embedded in the simulation. They're dense clusters of data that may screw with your ability to navigate Eivor's memories.<LF><LF>Approach with caution. We don't know what they'll do if you get too close. They may be harmless, they may induce occipital shock, or wipe your mind. Hard to say. Best to err on the side of "hell no." But if you're curious, well, I warned you.<LF><LF>PIECES OF EDEN<LF>We don't know of any Isu artifacts you should be looking for specifically, but they're out there, and this was a period where they often cropped up in legend. Norse and Saxon songs and tales speak of them often, so keep your eyes peeled.<LF><LF>Especially around Stonehenge. How could that NOT be an Isu site?

Rebecca,<LF><LF>Before we meet at the site, I want you to see these.<LF><LF>Last week, I reviewed the logs from my time with Bayek and came across some old notes. In the "years" I explored Cleopatra's Egypt, I stumbled across six Isu temples, most of which were buried beneath pharaonic tomb sites. Each temple contained an Isu message clearly meant for one with the ability to read genetic memories. I was the lucky one. I don't believe they were intended for Bayek himself, as he seemed wholly unaware of the messages as they played. They may have been encoded in a way that only someone with an animus could see them.<LF><LF>It's been a few years since I last heard these messages, so my memory is foggy. But the notes I scribbled down have a clarity that I trust. Might be something to all this. I don't know. Often I grasp outside of my area of expertise. I am enthusiastic but often wrong. Let me know if something else strikes you.<LF><LF>Layla<LF><LF>*<LF><LF>Message 1 (Excerpt): <LF>"Layers upon layers of reality, each blurring into the next. Which is real, and which is not? What if none are real? What if everything you know is false? We ran thousands of simulations, searching for the right version, searching for Desmond. Each one of them felt real. But there's no way of truly knowing, is there? Not for sure. Anything can be simulated, and finding the answer could mean erasure."<LF><LF>Teasing the Assassin maxim "Nothing is true…" Must be careful not to confuse truths with facts however, a language game you will always lose. Though we may stumble in our attempts to interpret it the world, the universe, reality, what have you, it is always "out there." I believe that, simulated or no.<LF><LF>We could imagine a dozen nested simulations, and each one, on the level of itself, would constitute a full reality. Wolfram, via Conway, suggests the universe is a giant cellular automata.<LF><LF>And further, there is a point where the difference between simulated and real is meaningless. If the universe were a simulation, what would it matter? The simulation qua simulation itself would be real, and therefore everything within it would be real within the confines of the simulation. <LF><LF>Say a scientist were able to simulate pain by inducing only a few neurons to fire; no physical harm. "I am in pain!" the subject says. "No, you only believe you are," says the scientist. This is meaningless, as is this: "You thought you were in pain but you were mistaken."

Acquired from the Eagle-Bearer, Kassandra, 2018.<LF><LF>Presumed manufacture date: Late in the Isu Singularity Age, ~75,100 BCE / ~2200 IE<LF><LF>This staff, one of many Isu staves known to us, is first and foremost a medical device with the ability to heal, repair, restore, and rejuvenate organic tissues with unprecedented swiftness. It has been known to extend the life of its bearers well-beyond the average human and Isu lifespans and is presumed to have the ability to resuscitate living creatures in critical or suspended states. It has not been verified if the staff has the ability to resurrect the dead, but this seems unlikely, based on its known features.<LF><LF>It appears to work by reading and copying its bearer's DNA to ensure perfect replication on a broad scale. It is able to detect erroneous copies and deploy repairs so long as its bearer remains within direct contact.<LF><LF>It has been used as a weapon, infrequently, possibly by taking advantage of the tremendous power it draws from the Isu's Wireless Energy Lattice.<LF><LF>The staff has also acted as a conduit or container for the personality of an Isu called "Aletheia." It is not known if this personality is Aletheia's original consciousness or a simulation of the original, though most neuroscientists would call this a distinction without a difference. As of early 2019, the entity known as Aletheia has made no further attempts to contact me.<LF><LF>As yet, my purpose as the so-called "Heir of Memories"-- s Aletheia has dubbed me--remains unclear.<LF><LF>Known Bearers<LF>Hermes Trismegistus: ~75,100 - 75,000 IE<LF>Pythagoras: 6th century BCE - 5th century BCE<LF>Kassandra: 4th BCE

Id: [0x002D99FC]
Those drops of Ymir's blood were not mine to take, and those who owned it are hunting for me. I knew this day would come, but it has come sooner than I thought. I had hoped … I had hoped I could show them.<LF><LF>They will not find this tower. I will leave and lead them away. Please, whoever finds this, use what blood remains. Continue my research. Bring flower to our land.

Id: [0x002D99FD]
My experiments have been a disaster so far. But I shall not surrender myself to failure. The future of Jotunheim is in my hands. I need Ymir's blood to progress further. But how to get it?

But we have long awaited our moment, and that moment has come at last. Aegir the fool wagered away our father's cauldron, and we, his sons, have seized it!<LF><LF>Drink now, and raise your horns to our father. Drink now in his memory.<LF><LF>Skal!

Leaf from Gunlod's Diary

Id: [0x002D9D72]
I sent Kala and Vindr away again. What persistent oafs they are, impervious to logic and sense. The more I dissuade them, the harder they try. As if I would let either of them paw at me, as they desire to. The very idea is not only repulsive, but boring. I have more important things to do than marry.

The god of thunder is among us. The Jotnar-slayer has his hammer in hand. He came veiled and in wedding garb, and Thrym, blinded by lust, believed him to be Freyja of the Aesir. When he threw off his veil and seized Mjolnir, I ran.<LF><LF>I hear him killing now. I hear the cries of my brothers and sisters. I have locked myself in, but no lock will stand up to that hammer.<LF><LF>I cannot get out. He is coming. I cannot get out.

But they know better than most what it means to live with such a burden. I am curious to know more about this "Heir of Memories" epithet. It is not a phrase we have heard in all our decades of research.<LF><LF>In a few weeks' time, we will contact you once more.

If you are not interested, or if you break any of our protocols, this will be the last time you hear from us.<LF><LF>Take this to heart … the world is sick, and getting sicker. The earth's magnetic field is growing stronger, satellites are falling from the sky, earthquakes are getting more frequent, famines are becoming more and more frequent. And now we have credible reports of a new and deadly virus sweeping through Asia. It can feel like we're living through a Yeatsian nightmare--"Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world." In many ways we are.<LF><LF>But there is hope. There is a cure. Us.<LF><LF>In the past few months, we have come across something that may help us solve our most pressing problems. A message, a very promising message, that may help us reverse the dire course we are on.<LF><LF>If you want to be part of the solution, join us. If not, we wish you the best of luck.

Hytham,<LF><LF>We are dismayed by the news of Basim's betrayal, yet only faintly surprised.

It seems instead he was chasing them.<LF><LF>At your soonest opportunity, we would hear from you in person to gain a full accounting. Our next council comes two summers from now. Mentor Fuladh of the Justanid region will host us at our newly constructed fortress Aluh-Amut in Deylam. We hope to see you there, if only to confer upon you a new title.

It was not how you were made.<LF><LF>You were born kind, sweet, loving. Soft and healing.<LF><LF>Your strength is in that, despite your size.<LF><LF>I should have understood this, and let you be the pacifist.<LF><LF>So instead, while you still live, know that you can be.<LF><LF>Know you can stop fighting, stop killing.

Bake.<LF>Be the you I did not let you become.<LF>And when they remember me as "The Merciless", do not let it be with praise.<LF>There is no glory in the power I wielded.<LF>And in the next life, I will do better.<LF><LF>I love you.<LF>Your Mother

Eivor reassures me that this was my decision, and that I have earned my own freedom, but this is modesty. Without Eivor, I would still be hiding behind a name, still be in bondage to the family. Still stealing, still hurting, still killing. It was the encouragement and support I needed to finally take this step on the path to my new life.<LF><LF>I will give this new liberty a few days to sink in. But I must confess, that as the chains fall away, my heart is beating a little quicker. Perhaps it is only circumstance and the euphoria of my new existence, but something in me was stirred, beyond simple admiration. If things continue this way, I may have to speak more candidly of my feelings, but until then, I will rest easy, bake bread, and look, smiling, toward the future.

Your flyting has much improved since last we dueled, but I wish to give a small note. You use many lines akin to this:<LF><LF>"And this fight I will win"<LF><LF>"And your face I do scorn"<LF><LF>I have made it my own rule never to use this construction, as it places the emphasis quite in the weaker place and feels quite twisted around.

My daughter and her husband did not exaggerate: Arth truly is a soft little fellow. I can see why they sent him to me. If he wields an axe like he wields a fishing rope, though, I doubt I should let him near even the firewood! Not if I want him to keep all his toes. Seems my work is cut out for me, whether I teach him fighting or fishery. So much for retirement.

Perhaps I judged too quickly! Arth is proving himself to be quite the capable little fisher. He used a knot today I've never seen before, and when I asked him about it, he said he did it in a dream! And sometimes he seems to know what the fish will do before they do! Maybe I'll give him a little more to do. Can't be too easy on him though, he may get lazy!

Id: [0x002DAA7D]
Followed a ram in the northern range today. He climbed about halfway up a granite cliff face before he disappeared. At first I thought he had fallen when I wasn't looking, but upon closer inspection, it seems there may be a cave there. Not sure how deep it goes, but it at least fits a whole goat inside! Must remember to venture there with a rope and some tackle soon. Could be treasure inside!

Well! I found the cave that I was curious about. Larger than I expected, but not quite large enough. Turns out it was already occupied.

Good thing the rope was dangling at the mouth otherwise I would have been butted right off.<LF><LF>That said, I did see something glittering behind him… I'll mark it down.

Id: [0x002DAA85]
You know that I adore you. But I must say, my sweet pea, that recently your boat-building plans have been very efficient and perfectly admirable but lacking in a certain … flair? I would only gently and lovingly suggest that next time you are drawing up new designs, you consider making the boats as beautiful as you are. Instead of just boring and functional.

Id: [0x002DAA86]
Note from Gudrun to Gudmund

Id: [0x002DAA87]
I love you so much. I would very much like you to remember, my beloved, that boat-building is the work of a craftswoman and not an artist. Flair and beauty are all well and good for those soft-hearted builders who have the time for fanciful designs, but perhaps I would lovingly suggest that if you want to build a boat, you consider making it effective instead of finding new ways to pretty it up.

The children are getting into such trouble lately! Just the other day, they brought in a whole box of squirrels they'd trapped and let them loose inside our house! There must have been twelve or thirteen of them, and it was pure chaos. They ran all about and covered all of my sailcloth in their droppings (the squirrels, I mean, not the children)! I know I am not encouraging such behavior, so I wrote in hopes that we might be able to form some sort of coalition and ensure that we are aligned on their discipline. Do let me know what you think.

Winfrith and Leofric have given their blessing and we are thinking of finding a new place to live together (in the settlement of course!) that we may pursue what our hearts desire. I hope that you will grant us your blessing, too.<LF><LF>But more than anything, Father, I hope that with me seeking my own adventures in love, you will feel that you can do the same. You deserve to find this joy again. And I suspect there are more than a few women who would be happy to seek it with you. <LF><LF>I love you!<LF>Mayda

Message 2 (Excerpt):<LF>"No surprise. You were designed to have boundaries, after all. And one cannot speak of that which one cannot conceive. The Code. Equations that define life. They are nestled deep within every star, and every mote of dust. Every second that passes is a word, a symbol. All part of an intricate yet simple language existing within the framework of time itself. It is the one rule which applies to us all. Immutable, inescapable."<LF><LF>We know this: humans were the instruments of an earlier species, the Isu. Resist the temptation to say superior. Different. They were better suited to some tasks, ill-suited to others. Possessed of a mind that we cannot know. But that does not get us anywhere. What is it like to be an Isu? What is it like to be a bat?<LF><LF>The implication that the Isu could "read" time is interesting, but if humans could read time, would it necessarily be in the same manner and for the same purpose? Whether constructed, or evolved, or a little of both as we are, we cannot be said to have been "built" to achieve the same ends. A round disk on its edge is a wheel; on its side, a plate. How we use something can often determine its value and its perceived purpose.

Id: [0x002DAE0B]
Message 3 (Excerpt):<LF>"Break the code. Break the node. These walls tell of a tragic story. A story we transcribed on our structures, on our artifacts. A story we could not alter. A mystery, defying us, in plain sight. We tried. Our scholars and scientists. Poets and physicists. Bright minds. Rebellious hearts. They all tried so hard to bring about change. They… We all failed. None could change what we discovered, the stories written into the walls of these rooms. The reader has no power. He is but an observer. But the author … the author invents the future. The author owns the future."<LF><LF>The Toba catastrophe, a super-volcanic event paired with a mass-coronal ejection, was the beginning of the end for the Isu. It changed the earth's environment, lowered its available oxygen levels, and generally fucked things up. The Isu never recovered. By our estimations, the last remaining Isu died just a century after the catastrophe. From that point forward, humans--their creation--ruled the roost.<LF><LF>This disaster was not unforeseen. Isu scientists had known about their impending doom for years, perhaps decades, before the catastrophe occurred. To protect themselves they worked feverishly to find a solution. Six methods they tried, but due to a toxic combination of hubris, political infighting, and bad luck, all six failed. The final method proved the most promising, and was nearly complete when tragedy struck. It was this method that Desmond Miles revived when he saved the world from a second solar flare in December 2012.<LF><LF>This voice laments the compounded failure of their species to save themselves, but the truth is broader than that. They, with Desmond, saved us. Success deferred.<LF><LF>Then this message, break the code, break the node. Insistent, and very puzzling.

Id: [0x002DAE0C]
Message 4 (Excerpt):<LF>"Linear continuity is a simulation that allows for variations. Within the linear continuity, there are nodes. Chokepoints. Moments where algorithms converge the flows of superposed possibilities to a single moment where only one absolute truth is possible. Paths are fluid, continuous. Nodes are static, changeless. And the wave function collapses the paths into nodes which branch out. Again, and again, and again. Can you feel the wave collapsing, trying to course-correct Desmond's act of defiance? The incoming node needs the world to end. The algorithms have been carving the flow of possibilities towards that end for over one hundred years now. Collapse the wave."<LF><LF>Well outside my area of expertise. Must contact someone who knows this shit better. But what it seems to be saying--the structure of spacetime the universe is built in such a way that certain events or clusters of events are compelled to occur. A bottleneck through which spacetime flows, and one nearly impossible to avoid. There is something about this catastrophe, the one Desmond averted in 2012, that compels it to return, indifferent to our fear or pain. It is a tidal wave, rippling across the sea of space. It crashed once against the dike, and that stopped it for a time. But the sea rears back for another strike, and another, and another.<LF><LF>That gives some clarity to what is happening now, all around us. But it remains unclear how to change it. Especially from within an animus, a simulation within a simulation?

Id: [0x002DAE0D]
Message 5<LF>"Reality is a mathematical model which gets solved over and over again by the observer. Your thoughts are computations. And they render this world for you to call your own. Not all processors are alike. Different brains produce different realities. The variations go from the subtle to the drastic. Your mind defines how much you can taste. How much you can feel. How much you can understand. Perception defines perspective. We designed you and made sure to engineer your senses so you could perceive just what we needed you to. Neither more nor less. There are parts of time we preferred you to remained blind to. It was a necessity."<LF><LF>If we could suddenly "see" time, that would not guarantee the same perception the Isu possessed. Let us speak of time as an entity, if we may. Let us say that time is a perceivable fact in the same way that light is a perceivable fact. The ability to "see" this fact in no way guarantees a sympathetic view. There are creatures tumbling around this earth that read light differently than we do, and for different purposes. Humans see in a well-known spectrum. ROY G BIV.<LF><LF>This sense of color is confined to the three cones we possess. Yet nocturnal creatures see with a different scope, for a different purpose. Night-stalking, hunting, lurking. They evolved in concert with their needs and are now constrained by them, as are we. Light is only a fact seen askance and used differently by different species. To suggest that we might read time, is to imply we have a specific use for time.

Id: [0x002DAE0E]
Message 6<LF>"The next chapter is unstoppable. And yet. The greatest revolutions sometimes originate from the confines of impossibility, do they not? Reality is a simulation. Break the code. And in so doing, escape the inescapable. The Animus was humankind's first unconscious attempt to explain what it could not see. Understanding genetic memories, an eye into history. Your animus is different. As is the mind that imagined it. It could escape the code. It could do that leap and make possible a decision that defies the order of things that are."<LF><LF>It is ridiculous to imagine that I could change the nature of reality "out there" from within the confines of an animus, a simulation within this so-called simulation. But I believe I understand what this voice is telling me. My animus is endowed with the ability to suggest alterations to days long past. From any moment in time, I can extrapolate what MIGHT have been. Calculations of time. I am not confined to what was, but what could have been.<LF><LF>Yes, history is real, facts do matter. But from any moment in time I choose within the Animus, I can interrogate the memory. I can ask the world what if? What if Bayek and Aya had stayed together? What if Khemu had not been murdered? I can suggest these hypotheticals and watch how they unfold. Why would I want to? For knowledge, for a better understanding of what tragedies were avoided? It remains to be seen.<LF><LF>I am, in a sense, a reader of the calculations. As the Isu were in days past. Perhaps one day I will be able to harness this talent to see into the future. To predict, to correct, to avoid. That would be worth something.

The Magas Codex

Id: [0x002DB2EC]
I.<LF><LF>On a typical day of study and training, as a departure from our usual routine, Master Hakor welcomed a guest to our Alexandrian Bureau. A taut woman with a stoic expression, she seemed to be in the later years of her fifth decade. She entered the hall with feathered steps and sat at the head of the room in silence for quite some time as Master Hakor delivered a vague introduction of this unknown figure. Throughout his speech, the woman never once glanced upon him, but swept her eyes across the acolytes seated before her, among whom I counted myself.<LF><LF>When at last Master Hakor stepped aside, the woman stood and opened with a blunt statement:<LF><LF>If nothing is true, she said, this statement must also be false….<LF><LF>The woman left her words hanging in the air. After a long and puzzled silence, a keen acolyte called Magas offered a reply:<LF><LF>The Creed itself is an irony. It suggests that the world cannot be broken into truths and falsehoods, facts and fictions. <LF><LF>Yes, the woman replied. The world merely is. It exists and we are but a small part of its wholeness.<LF><LF>II.<LF><LF>Another silence. Magas opened his mouth, inhaled, and shut it without speaking. <LF><LF>We gift this permission to ourselves, the woman said. We are the source of our own purpose.<LF><LF>None said a word in reply as the woman looked us over. It seemed that she was neither pleased nor dissatisfied with our silence. Then she began pacing the room, slowly, turning about and looking around our hidden hall with an expression that verged on nostalgia or satisfaction. <LF><LF>With this knowledge, she continued, with this understanding comes a great and terrible freedom. The freedom to rise or fall, to live or die, by your own volition. This is why our Creed cuts as cleanly as a double-edged sword. You must take this paradox to heart. The success or failure of our Brotherhood depends on your willingness to live in the unfeeling emptiness of this world, as if lost in Tartarus, alone and hopeless, yet bearing a hope that a door will one day open and let in the light. And that you shall exit, not alone, but with all your brothers and sisters at your side.<LF><LF>The woman stopped for a moment to run her hand over a dilapidated stony pillar. She seemed to be reliving an old or half-forgotten memory. Catching herself, she stepped away and continued.<LF><LF>Because they were with you all along, your brothers and sisters, beside you in the shadows. You walked in the darkness in silence, but you were never alone.<LF><LF>III.<LF><LF>Yet to see the last light, you must first feel the loss, the emptiness, the pain. And you must act always with the belief that you have failed, that you will fail again, that you must always fail. This is the way of the Hidden Ones. To fail better than you have before. We wander in the dark ever searching for the light.<LF><LF>She then paused and drew a great breath.<LF><LF>But here I must contradict myself. For although the nature of reality is empty and unknowable, the nature of our work is not. And for this Brotherhood to succeed, we must have tenets by which we may judge our success. Hard, cold rules. Truths by which we swear.<LF><LF>A faint murmur rushed through the gathered acolytes at the realization of what was happening. The Final Codification, long rumored, was now upon us. The woman spoke again, with more gravity than before.<LF><LF>Since the twilight of the Ptolemies, the Hidden Ones have served to break the unnatural shackles that man puts upon man. And we have done so in a manner consistent with our Creed, yet this has often led to confusion and chaos. Thus have we devised a set of three tenets, borne from rigorous practice and application, to lead us to greater success.<LF><LF>One, she began, Hide in plain sight, that your success may come in view of all, yet swiftly and without forewarning.<LF><LF>Two, Never compromise the brotherhood. Be thoughtful in act and speech, for it is the only sure way to protect ourselves from outside influence, and keep our motives uncorrupted.<LF><LF>IV.<LF><LF>And Three, Stay your blade from the flesh of an innocent. Only those with active malice in their hearts need answer for their cruelty. The unwilling pawns of evil, and the bystanders caught in their wake, do not deserve the sting of our steel.<LF><LF>This is the decree of the Hidden Ones. Three tenets, together with the Creed, to define our path forward. Only these, and nothing more. To encumber ourselves further would only dilute our resolve.<LF><LF>Here Magas spoke again, most ardently now – Yet, if nothing is true, how can we justify such strictures? Should we not be free to pursue our goal in whatever fashion we see fit?<LF><LF>You feel this is a fatal irony? the woman asked.<LF><LF>I only wonder at the contradiction, Magas said. From what authority do these tenets derive?<LF><LF>We are Hidden Ones, a title we gave ourselves. As we gave ourselves a goal, the physical and spiritual liberation of man. These are self-made ambitions. To achieve them, therefore, we laws to guide us. There is no magic in these words, no appeal to a higher authority. We follow them only because they help us achieve what we ourselves have defined. These laws they allow us to persist. The effectiveness of any tenet must be judged on the outcome of its practice.<LF><LF>She grew silent for a moment, looked at Master Hakor, then back at us.<LF><LF>Let it be known and recorded; these are the conclusions of the final Synod of the Hidden Ones. There will not be another. Today the shadow falls, now and for all time, to obscure us forever more. Let our work continue only in the dark.<LF><LF>V.<LF><LF>Work in silence from this day forward. Speak not your names, nor the names of your family and friends. For to do so would be a deadly compromise and a useless gesture. Seek not recognition, nor glory, nor compensation for your duty. Seek only the light, however dimly it may flicker upon the horizon.<LF><LF>Pausing, the woman smiled slightly. For the first time since her arrival she seemed content.<LF><LF>We are Hidden Ones, all of us, forever together in our solitude. May it ever be so.<LF><LF>She stopped there and gave a slight nod and turned and strode towards the exit at the back of the hall, making no sound as she went. The room stayed silent for a time, until Master Hakor broke the peace by urging us to our afternoon studies. Euclid was the subject this day, and amid a rustle of scrolls the acolytes set to work.<LF><LF>Some hours later I found myself in the garden outside the tomb of Alexander Rex, enjoying a bowl of dates and thinking on the lessons of the day, and of the woman who had given us so much to ponder. So deep in thought was I, that I did not notice the arrival of Magas, who startled me with a touch on the shoulder.<LF><LF>Quite a day, was it not? he said, excited. To be visited by such a one?<LF><LF>VI.<LF><LF>Mistaking my inquiring expression for censure, Magas waved his hands before him.<LF><LF>I know, I know, he said. Glory and recognition are frowned upon. Our anonymity is our weapon. But allow me this one moment of glee. For to meet one of our founders, the woman who ended the Ptolemies no less … it is not a chance we shall have again.<LF><LF>A founder, I repeated. Of the Hidden Ones? Her?<LF><LF>Yes, O, yes, Magas said. Her true name is lost to the living, as are the names of all our first Hidden Ones. A testament to their devotion, I suppose! But a woman this colored and stained by history cannot live invisible in her own time. She has seen the blood of Caesar, the tears of Cleopatra, and the wrath of Imperator Augustus no less!  <LF><LF>Magas leaned in close, so that only I amid the drifting bees and butterflies would hear.<LF><LF>She would kill me for speaking her name, but I’ll say it! Amunet they called her, a long time ago. And today, for a moment, she lived not in memory but in flesh. As for the rest, they are gone … and happier for it, I think.

Contract: The Stolen Purse

Id: [0x002DB9ED]
Reda's Thousand Eyes have spotted a warrior attacking one of their informers to steal his opal purse. Reda wants revenge and will generously remunerate you with one-tenth of the reward … his definition of generosity must be revised.

Id: [0x002DB9EF]
A rich Frankish margrave tasked Reda to find the thief who tried to steal the Sword of Dijon.

Reda is known for his oratory skills and his pretentious air. He participated in a flyting contest to earn the grand verse master title and beat his opponent soundly. But the man refused to pay his winnings. Big mistake.

Reda's rarest weapon has been stolen recently. If you want to continue to buy outstanding products from your favorite supplier, you had better find these thieves and teach them a lesson.

Id: [0x002DBA64]
A holy order devoted to the Holy Spirit and their love of brewing beer has asked Reda to track down one of their monks. It seems this wayward brother dishonored their sacred recipe by adding black pepper to the brew. A crime against good ale is a crime against us all.

Reda's informers have witnessed a terrible scene while exploring the region. A dark cult has established itself in a forest to practice their rituals to glorify death deities.

Id: [0x002DBA6B]
Contract: The Dark Cult

Id: [0x002DBA6C]
Recent news has reached Reda's ear that an active cult believes that the end of the world is near. The problem? They stole the food reserves of one of our suppliers to prepare themselves for Ragnarok. Reda is tolerant about a lot of things, but stealing food from the needy is not one of them.

An informer reported to Reda the presence of an aggressive predator roaming in the region. He saw the beast with his own eyes and described it as "a large shadow with long and deadly fangs!" It's time to investigate.

Id: [0x002DBA7E]
Rumors have been circulating that a deadly beast is roaming around here. These reports may have been exaggerated due to the general hysteria, but we cannot deny the tremendous amount of victims. We count on you to investigate this issue.

Id: [0x002DBA7F]
"The devil roams this place." That's the way Reda's informers describe the beast who is causing panic in the region. Defeat it before it kills again.

Id: [0x002DBA80]
"A monster!" they said. A creature described as a wide-mouthed beast capable of shredding the armor of any warrior. Reda does not know if this monster actually exists, but we will appreciate your help in unveiling this mystery.

Id: [0x002DBA81]
Reda sent an informer to hunt a monstrous animal … but he never came back. He was probably too young to defeat such a large creature. Could you take care of this problem?

Id: [0x002DBA82]
Reda's Thousand Eyes reported the presence of a fearsome beast in the region. One of them even claimed to see the creature devouring the remains of its last victim! It's time to investigate.

It's no surprise that wild animals hunt in that area, but we need to navigate it nonetheless. Make it safer, Eivor.

Id: [0x002DBA84]

An old rivalry between two villages is becoming more and more intense. One side has recently paid mercenaries to mount an attack. The other side needs help. Consider lending them a hand.

Id: [0x002DBA91]
There are two things that Reda hates the most in this World: seeing innocents killed by bandits and losing money on a deal. He knows that you cannot do much to make his bets more profitable, but your fighting skills can definitely save a nearby village from being burnt down.

Id: [0x002DBA92]
Informers report that a friendly village is under attack! Bandits attacked, killing anyone present on the road. The report mentions the extreme violence of the assailants with one simple sentence: "The blood of the farmers was watering their furrow."

Letter Concerning the Rigsogur

Id: [0x002DBB1C]
Dear Scribes, Nobles, Rulers and the Holy Diocese of Ledecestrescire,<LF><LF>I greet you with friendship and the love of God. My name is Brissy the Elder. I have studied under the disciples of Wilfrid, Alcuin and I have also followed the many skalds of the much-maligned Lords of Daneland and the Norge. I was captured by one Rig "The Slippery Wisdom" during a raid a Whitby Abbey. I since lived with the heathen at Goldborough and converted many while following their great journeys and turning towards God.<LF><LF>Based on the stories I have heard around the hearth and the many battles and adventures I have witnessed, I compiled this saga in the spirit of our great poets Caedmon and Cynewulf, and have so dutifully taken note of the story of Rig. His Rigsogur is as great as that of Beowulf's or Ragnar Lothbrok. It must be written and rewritten and told throughout the scrolls of our land and beyond the shores, for his name is immortal.<LF><LF>What I saw of his might, his merriment, and his godly touch is unlike any other story before or after. He was plagued by a demon's voice, and I worry the Devil hath taken him, and not the angels. However be his tale one of woe and warning, or of brightness and valor, it merits retelling. I have included with my scop's seal and the story of Rig. Please I beg of you, share it and teach it amidst the mead halls and beneath the belfries of our good Lord. This manuscript is sacred.<LF><LF>My warmest light,<LF><LF>Brissy the Elder

I.<LF>Welcome fair traveler, curious Child of His. I am Brendan of Ireland, and through light and voice have these stones spoken to me. Here lies the markings of Him, where a second voice, higher than most, spoke to me again. Listen to all I have learned through prayer. Long ago was a Great and tragic war. The offspring of gods who lived before the Deluge. I pray for these Rebel Angels who came before.<LF><LF>II.<LF>Here, I believe, is where the Nephilim placed sacred stones to guard the chattel of God from other giants. Those present were scared by demons, and God defended the pious, sending the giants away. Only these holy reverberations remain. The work of good souls who have the earth in their heart will forever be tied to our ancestors and our Lord via this gateway.<LF><LF>III.<LF>Again I find traces of the Nephilim. By edict of the local king, I shall prayeth to Him, that this light may be known as holy. These luminous placards are the divining rods of Him who speaks to me. With effort, I seek the union of all His holy creations. Aita, Juno, Minerva, names that enter my head. Are these the Nephilim He reveals to me? Are these stones their signposts? I pray for your guidance, Lord. Amen.<LF><LF>IV.<LF>The Kingdom of Bernicia and Elmet have granted me the right to worship here, by edict of Eoppa of Bernicia. The Nephilim were the only race with the strength to have moved such pillars, with the power of the Lord behind them. But what were they guarding against? Did you command them, Lord? Was it for the sin of people of other times? Was it to keep the demons out?<LF><LF>V.<LF>I shall inform the local Wuffingas that He lives among them, through traces of the Nephilim, the giant warriors who fought for God in their ancient time. They hath left his presence here on earth for us to absorb His light. The light of angels that hath been infused throughout the earth. I feel His power. He calls me My Beloved, and I am calmed. I respondeth with my communion, my piety, and become another of His voices.<LF><LF>VI.<LF>Here lieth still more remnants of the Nephilim. I have marked a symbol upon the stones, that future folk may imbue their spirit with the energy within. For those who wish to seek communion with the Lord here, be wary. For He speaks through ciphers, and his words are woven with ancient fibers. He is manifest here. He hath made importance of these pillars, brought by the giants of yore, now guarding us, as only He knows. Amen.<LF><LF>VII.<LF>I am proud the Lord speaks so cleanly through my soul here in Wreocensaete. He talks of his instruments, and asks that I be one. It appears the Nephilim were at battle here long ago. Against a great tempest, some few protected us. We must honor these ancient paths. I have explained what He left for us here to the Wreckin-Dwellers nearby. Blessed be all those who tread in this Holy light.<LF><LF>VIII.<LF>I spoke with Him again. He said that he pined, and I feel torn in two: my loyalty to Him tears me one direction, and the Nephilim point elsewhere. Why hath these voices spoken to me? The gospels sing within me, and yet I sense conflict. I sense disagreement among the angels. It saddens me greatly. I will one day weigh my soul, attempt penance, attempt to repent for the missteps in my life. Yet here all shineth brightest, for He let me see.<LF><LF>IX.<LF>I have come upon these ancient timbers, tarred for preservation, to mark my sacred symbol and pinpoint the source of their power. As I pray, the Lord sends through me the voice of a Holy Spirit. It reverberates with the finery of ancient language, and I am made anew. Were these timbers carried by the Nephilim? Barriers against invasions from afar? Please, Lord, let this truth shineth upon me as bright as your Word doth.<LF><LF>X.<LF>Here in the ancient Kingdom of Cent, the Jutes have brought me to where his fire burns through traces of the Nephilim. Here the Lord speaks to me again. He warns of betrayals, of struggles, of the trials of the First Ones. I do not always understand His message. If He is warning me, it is because He believes I am worthy. He says there is one angel still trapped, she who must be released or joined. Must I find her?<LF><LF>XI.<LF>Here in the Chew Valley, Old Kings of Hwicce still dance with the stones of the Nephilim. I have taught them of the power that sings here. "How dare you tamper with these sacred threads," a voice scolded me. "You must leave me," he said. "Divorced from the Illuminat." His voice waxes and wanes, but a soft song still finds me in my penance. I bend a knee and leave a grain of sand for the old winds.<LF><LF>XII.<LF>This is a different site. One resplendent in a manner unto itself. Where His light shines greatest. Today, I was warned of a harrowing depth. After the Nephilim, great battles were fought in resurrective Kingdoms of Christ. Many were lost in the fight, many more in the cataclysm that followed. Today my Lord instructed me in plain words to travel o'er the ocean and seek the door behind which hides his fallen angel. I shall try, in His name. Amen.<LF><LF>XIII.<LF>Here I, Brendan of Clonfert, servant of Our Lord, do make my final inscription before this holy fount of light. My journey is ended. For two and some years have I heeded the inner-voice of my Lord, and followed it to this place to receive His word. I have seen the gate with its ancient markings. I have heard the voice of His angel, calling me Beloved. Yet the way did not open. His voice yet calls to me still, in blissful forms, torturous to me. Yet the way remains closed. My way forward is … uncertain.

Smithcraft is not a task, it is a calling. It is not a making, it is a binding. You cannot simply be a shaper, you must put some of yourself into it. Blood, sweat, spit, it matters not, but the mixing is of equal import to what is mixed.

Is God testing me? Has he put a heathen man, one who forsakes the love and sacrifice of Christ himself, to test my ability to love others? To love my enemies, that I may find the closure for those lost to this same plague that seems to be ailing Halfdan.<LF><LF>Mother, you taught me to love all regardless even as I am shunned by my brethren. I am trying my best, mother. Alas, back then, it was not enough to save you. I hope it will be different this time.

What is a puppet? Is a puppet not aware that it is controlled entirely by another, or does he believe that he is acting of his own volition tugged ever so slightly at the urging of his God? Maybe our lives are solely in the hands of God, and if so, I'd rather it be the hands of the one true God.

To my dearest wife,<LF><LF>I know your patience has been tested, time and time again. I am the one to blame, and the fault is mine alone. For we were young, and I had begged you to marry me. I know in recent time that I have gone astray. The path of vice was the easiest to tread. But I see clearer now, without drink, without smoke.<LF><LF>Thank you for all that you have done … for your kindness, warmth, and for tending our stall in Picheringa. Happy Anniversary, my darling.

Hemming jarl did not spend his years here working with the Saxons to have them do this. Yet these clergymen keep me against my will in the name of their God to "purge us heathens" from their lands. I am no warrior, just a farmer. But perhaps that is why those cowards forced me into captivity because they would not stand a chance against our battle-worn kin.

Id: [0x002DC2C8]
Hemming jarl, our scouting party has been decimated. You must be wary of the Pict Warlord, the one wielding a grand atgeir.

It was as if he was in a trance, one with his bloody edge. Be careful, my jarl.

The Picts are ruthless and have no qualms in resorting to sneak attacks and ambushes.

Lord says he feels as if he has swallowed a live hedgehog and a cricket and now the former deigns to chase the latter about his insides. <LF><LF>-Hunwald not seen for many weeks.

Yet with so much time freed up, I dare note here that my Latin has improved with practice. To one day read the scriptures myself in the Holy Roman tongue would be a blessing indeed.

Session Report: SHastings

Id: [0x002DC35D]
Animus Session Report<LF><LF>Date: 3 November 2014<LF>Operator: Rebecca Crane<LF>Subject: Shaun Hastings<LF>Reporter: William Miles<LF><LF>Preface: The transformation of the Order of the Ancients into the Templars as we know them today has always been a subject of considerable debate among our ranks. We have operated with the assumption that the Templars themselves hold some or complete knowledge of this evolution, but at present, no concrete historical evidence has ever made it into our hands.<LF><LF>What little data we do have is mostly a matter of public record, with some exceptions. It is commonly understood that the origin of the Knights Templar dates back to 1119 CE, and this indeed was the appearance of the public face of the Templars. However, our records attest to the existence of Templar agents at least two centuries before this date.<LF><LF>In one badly damaged document, an "Assassin Contract" from Normandy in the mid-11th century, the author makes free use of the term Templar. An earlier letter--his time from a Hidden One in the region of modern-day Dorset, circa 978 CE--makes mention of a "Templar spy" within the ranks of the Brotherhood. From this we can safely assume that the Templar Order, as an entity distinct from the Order of the Ancients, existed at some point in the mid-10th century.<LF><LF>With an aim to expand our understanding of this dark age, one of our agents recently volunteered to delve into his genetic memories to search for further clues to this age-old mystery. Unfortunately, what he discovered was of little use for our purposes.<LF><LF>Shaun Hastings began the first of his seven sessions on October 5th, 2014. Over the course of the next three weeks, he followed various matrilineal and patrilineal lines into the past, focusing on the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, in search of Assassins and/or Templars in his bloodline. He found none. Of minor interest, however, was the following personage, here noted for the peculiarity of his biography.<LF><LF>Alrekr Thorvaldson, an early 9th century Jute who sailed north from modern-day Denmark with a wooden plank bearing a carving of a map that purported to mark the location of "Thor's hammer." Alrekr made it as far as Stavanger before running afoul of a powerful clan there. Alrekr was defeated in battle and enthralled as a slave. He escaped his captivity some ten years later, and returned to Jutland to marry and settle down. The location of Alrekr's map is unknown, and the existence of "Thor's hammer"--a precursor relic, no doubt--remains unconfirmed.<LF><LF>Alrekr's ancestors would later sail to England following the Norman's conquest of the island, settling in what is now called Loughborough in modern-day Leicestershire. The irony that a man named Hastings would contain no useful genetic memory data regarding the Norman invasion of England in 1066 was not lost on our dear subject. Still, he retained his usual chipper wit, and asked if he might next relive the genetic memories of his grandfather to, quote, "give a Nazi a proper bollocking."

I immediately saw some suspicious similarities with ancient languages. So now that I could decipher the glyphs, I dug into our Precursor archives for more sources. I had to sort through the many different types of writings we found on Precursor sites to find some similar to that inscription. It's quite puzzling how many seemingly unrelated writing systems they had! Maybe the Precursors were not as monolythic a civilization as we think? Anyway, after more in-depth comparative work, the conclusion is unequivocal: this language is related to ancient  languages from the Indo-European family, maybe even others. In fact, given the corpus I have studied I would say that it is probably an ancestor to them. Or at least it had a significant influence on them.

Two Poems Concerning Guthlac

Id: [0x002DC392]
Guthlac A<LF><LF>His life on the couch of God was one of piety and devotion. Living from the mud and with the birds, the angels did visit him. They told him the proper way of living without jewels, without fatty meals and glory-whores. With a spirit occupying your pious bones, and spring in your step so that the angels hear your song and match it thus.<LF><LF>Guthlac B<LF><LF>No one lives proper any longer. After all the joy He brought us, we have lost our ways. Only those who abandon the blood-soaked scrolls of sin-seared thrones remain on a great path. Find a corner in the world and eat the apples our orchards provide. For otherwise we are doomed.

Id: [0x002DC48A]
The passing of our Lord Ricsige was most shocking, and even to have heard that he betrayed our country! He always seemed so pleasant as much as I heard his dark whispers against Halfdan. I have heard of his … unpredictable behavior … and I wonder if Halfdan is the king we truly need in Ricsige's stead.

Maldon. Is it too much to ask that we stop setting ablaze those structures still standing? I understand your frustrations with the state of our fair town, but all these "accidental" infernos are only hurting ourselves.<LF><LF>Yours in consternation, Brother Thomas

Sincere Apology

Id: [0x002DC5A3]
My good friends: First, let me apologize for the tone of my last missive. I admit that patience is a virtue I have been sorely lacking. I have now prayed to the Lord for guidance. He has shown me that the fault lies with me and the temptation I put in your path. So, I have locked up all the oil jars, and let this be an end to the arson.<LF><LF>Yours hopefully, Brother Thomas

Wonderful children of God. It has been six days since the last fire in Malden. The joy this gives me, I confess I am giddy. Perhaps now we can start to rebuild. The beautiful shoots of recovery emerging like spring flowers from the ashes.<LF>You are truly blessed.<LF><LF>Brother Thomas

Who would have thought that these white crystals harvested in the marshlands of Essex would be more valuable than silver? As it should be, the process is a labored one. Cutting into the silt marshes, lining them with clay to stop them succumbing to vegetation. All for salt. What a difference it makes to the sweaty overcooked meat they insist on serving in the alehouses here. I cannot wait to return to my beloved Francia.<LF><LF>And soon with the money I have skimmed off this operation, I will see her shores again.

I do not know how many raids and attacks we have suffered. I have ceased to count the hordes that come. Bandits, Vikings, wild animals.

This day we came upon a fascinating sight. Here of old did the gods of the Aesir rest on their return from our realm. In their wake were three of monstrous form, the spawn of Lokkju and She-Who-Tames-Tongues. A wyrm, a pup, a child half dead. The wyrm, though young, was growing before their eyes, so the gods tied it to this tree as they slept. When morning came, they released it and went on their way.

Reeve Goodwin came to me to aid our king. Hemorrhoids. The king suffers greatly from ficus and receives this painful ailment as a divine reward, sent at his request to assist him in resisting carnal desire. I prescribed balm, and have received good news that the itching has eased.

On my return to Anecastre, I stopped to feed my horse by the Roman ruins to the east. I must have taken that road hundreds of times, and never once did I pay any attention to the fissure in the rocks beneath.<LF><LF>But there was a howling wind coming out from there today, which leads me to believe the fissure runs deep. I've heard tales of riches in ruins like these. Perhaps I will have a look inside my next time out, but nothing more. Lord knows my fear of dark places.

Last night I awoke to strange sounds in the distance. Groaning, yelping. It was disconcerting to say the least, but I did not think much of it and went back to sleep.<LF><LF>In the morning, I counted one fewer cow in the fields. She did not wander, but was taken. I could see footsteps in the mud where the cattle graze--luckily the rain had fallen heavily overnight, and I was able to follow them north to the abandoned church.<LF><LF>There, I saw what I had feared. The cow, slaughtered in what appeared to be some ritual. Who these savages are, I do not know. But I will not lose another of my livestock to their perversions.

I captured a Viking, and he told me a wonderful story. About Freyr and his pet boar, Golden Bristles. He said that boar was like a god. I want a boar like that. So I fed the Viking to Cecil. I think he is changing already. I can see it in his tusks. They look shinier than usual, and he has a weird little smile. Like he knows something secret.<LF><LF>He is becoming a god, and he demands more fresh meat.

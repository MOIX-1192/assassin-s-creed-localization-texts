Le Père Duchesne
<LF>ay 1790<LF>Mlle. Montansier is about to present another of her trifles. She does well to avoid political subject matter, as her royalist tendencies cannot be hidden. But are the citizens of Paris expected to endure salacious amusements concerning infidelity among the aristos? At this critical stage in history? Leave our dear Mademoiselle to her pretty costumes and other frippery. We true Parisians have better things to do with our energies!

Valérie Duclos, neé Monvoisin, was poisoned by her younger sister Amélie who wanted to inherit their ancestor's fortune and gain independence.
  <LF> The crime revolved around an old legacy created by Marguerite Monvoisin, whose fortune (likely earned through the use and sale of exotic poisons) is passed down to the eldest surviving female of that line. Valérie, as the eldest, had inherited the fortune, but her husband (whose death also raises questions) wrote a conflicting will. It was this will that put the money out of Valérie's hands, declaring family friend Georges Villiers-Segonzac as executor and her son, Pierre Duclos, as sole trustee.
 <LF>   Valérie received a lawyer's assurances that the entire fortune did, in fact, belong to her, but with the qualification that as long as Georrges Villiers-Segonzac was "active," she would not enjoy control of it. It is for this reason that Valérie was especially angry on this night, and also for this reason that the notion of denouncing Georges to the Committee of Public Safety, thereby removing him from the equation, came into her head.
 <LF>   However, her younger sister, Amélie, without an income of her own and dependant upon her relations, realized that if Valérie died the money would come to her as the next female in line. 
 <LF>  Using a recipe inherited by Valérie, Amélie concocted a powerful poison which she stored in a poison ring (also inherited). On this particular evening, the victim threatened to denounce Georges. Amélie saw the incredible opportunity of removing her sister while leaving the hapless Georges as the obvious culprit. She secretly poisoned Valérie's cocoa, then gave the cup to Georges and discarded her ring in the garden.

De Sade's valet, after years of witnessing scenes of debauchery and being subject to humiliations himself, was lured by an agent of St-Just to frame de Sade for a murder. The valet collected some of de Sade's personal effects, met with the St-Just's agent and went to the brothel where he murdered Suzanna in show of "sadism."

Friar Honoré became obsessed with the predictions of Nostradamus and brought his friend Friar Jean into his obsession. Together, they plotted to make one of Nostradamus' predictions come true: Honoré poisoned a cask of wine and Jean served it to the elder monks (the eldest of the "branches"). In a fit of remorse, Friar Jean decided to confess and was in the act of writing of this decision in his diary when he was surprised by Friar Honoré, who then strangled Jean with his own rosary beads. Honoré then attempted to burn a page from Jean's diary, but was seen by the vineyard worker and ran off in a fright.

Descendants of some well-known medieval inquisitors had been living peacefully under aliases - anagrams of their forefathers names - until recently when one of them, Bertrand Grimany (descendant of de Marigny), foolishly gave an interview to a city newspaper. The article exposed his address and he was subsequently murdered, a large bloody roman numeral I inscribed on his wall. However, Grimany managed to wrest a pendant with a key away from his murderer in the struggle. Grimany's friend, Paul Teragon (the first body discovered, and descendant of de Nogaret) was then murdered, and a bloody roman numeral II left behind. The third descendant, M. de Prasi (from de Paris), would have doubtless suffered the same fate but managed to fight off the attacker. A blood trail leads to the murderer, Anne de Molay, a descendant of the famous Templar victim of the medieval inquisitors. She had taken vengeance on the descendants of her forbearer's torturers.

In an unusual arrangement, Mme Beaudry was both the biggest customer and the fiercest rival of Samuel Maran. She was an avid consumer of his tonic but was also selling it for cheap at her stall by adding cheaper elements into the mixture. When Maran, who already had a difficult rapport with Mme Beaudry, discovered this he realized why he was losing most of his business. He therefore sent Beaudry a new tonic for her to try. Beaudry received the delivery and after unwittingly giving the tonic a taste she dropped dead in an alley. An unlucky vagrant that came upon her body decided to rummage through her purse and try the poisonous mixture himself. An unwise decision.

Philibert Aspairt was in over his head with debt. He had spent all his earnings gambling and building up a tab at the local tavern. One night, in a drunken haze, he wandered straight into the Paris catacombs. He was lucky enough to stumble upon a large stash of precious Chartreuse. The Chartreuse was made by Carthusian monks and said to be hidden by the nuns of the convent Couvent des Filles de l'Enfant Jésus. Seeing an easy way to clear his debts, Philibert attempted to steal as much Chartreuse as he could carry.
<LF>He had not accounted for the fact that Sister Sorel, who was charged with hiding the cherished elixir, wouldn't take too kindly to thievery. She kept a watchful eye of the catacombs. She also politely gave Philibert a warning that he ignored. When Philibert once again returned for more Chartreuse, he was met with a shovel to the head. Sister Sorel ensured Philibert would remain in the catacombs for the rest of his days.

Warden Leroux had been helping run La Salpêtrière prison for many years. His Deputy, Hugo Soulière, had grown tired of waiting his turn in line. After learning the Warden had some very serous gambling debts with a local gang, Les Marcheurs Morts, Deputy Hugo saw his opportunity. Having learned much about the gang's methods in prison he ordered their custom blade at the local blacksmith, one that leaves the mark of an "x" on its victims. He then stabbed the Warden on his way home from work and tossed the corpse into a tub filled with chemicals at the local tannery. He made the bloody marking of the "x" clearly visible for all to see. 

T<LF> ensure the crime could never be traced to him, Deputy Hugo decapitated Warden Leroux' head and placed it on a pike outside the prison. This was meant to appear to be a "message" sent by Les Marcheurs Morts to the next warden in line, Deputy Hugo himself. As an added bonus it turned out the Warden's wife, Mme. Camille, had been having an affair behind her husband's back. Deputy Hugo thought he was in the clear.<LF><LF>Unfortunately, despite all the work he'd done covering his tracks, Hugo's own words were his downfall. The Deputy's statement claimed Leroux left his post the previous evening, while Leroux' wife and neighbors revealed he’d been missing for at least two days.

Jean-Paul Marat’s revolutionary newspaper, “The Friend of the People,” outraged many in France. Being an outspoken Jacobin supporter, he had no shortage of enemies. This included Charlotte Corday, a minor aristocrat from Caen. She had aligned with the Girondists and had grown to believe Marat was radicalizing the revolution with his inflammatory newspaper. Believing France could descend into civil war, she decided to assassinate Marat in an attempt to prevent more bloodshed. She visited his house claiming to have a list of Girondist leaders for Marat to examine. Marat invited her upstairs, where he was soaking in a tub to soothe a persistent skin condition. Corday listed off fake Girondist names and Marat began to scrawl them down quickly. Corday seized the opportunity and pierced his heart with a blade, killing him almost instantly. 

C<LF>rday wanted to inflict confusion and fear among the Jacobin ranks and it worked. Despite the inevitable noise of clues and suspects that surrounds any high-profile murder, the truth was deceptively simple for those who cared to look close enough. The list of Girondist names provided by Corday contained a basic code that pointed to the Hotel Providence. Inside one of the rooms was a hand-written confession by Corday that claimed, “I kill one man to save 100,000.”

A deranged patient at La Salpetriere asylum, Simon Larue, managed to steal a medical journal outlining surgical procedures from a visiting surgeon. He became obsessed with dissecting flesh, experiencing illusions of being a surgeon himself. After practicing on rats he'd find in his cell, Larue felt ready to test what he learned on the world. He made a daring escape and several civilians were murdered, their mutilated bodies dumped in a shack by the Seine. He eventually found work at a local butcher's shop, where he continued to hone his skills with the blade. Still, the escaped asylum patient was sloppy. His sand covered boots and a butcher's knife left in the shack pinned him directly to the crime.

Readers! In this time of change, let France not forget her history. The Inquisition effectively ended in France well over one hundred years past, yet the descendants of the Inquisitors live and walk among us. Let us cast our minds back and recall those three infamous prosecutors shown in our engraving from left to right: de Nogaret, de Marigny, and de Paris. These three are identified by medallions with numerals, medallions which they proudly regarded as a numbering of holy rank. We know today that several of their children changed their names to avoid retribution. We've discovered here in Paris a descendant of Philippe de Marigny. He is the prosperous merchant Bernard Grimany of the Île de la Cité. He gave us the honor of receiving us at his home at 6 rue des Marmousets, where we admired his collection of thumbscrews and a chair studded with spikes - which he confided to us are family heirlooms.

Books and papers relating to the appearances throughout history of the Red Ghost of the Tuileries. They show that in 1561 one Johannes Metzger(a Bavarian known in Paris as Jean L'Écorcheur) vowed vengeance on the Crown at his execution. The appearances of the Red Ghost began at that point and have continued until the present. Several books detail investigations at the Tuileries in search of the ghost and recount tales of mysterious noises, secret rooms and strange apparitions.

Id: [0x00078978]
Sir, I know as a fact that the ghost exists and is dangerous. There is no doubt in my mind that it is capable of horrendous acts that no man should be subject to. The legend says the ghost haunts your office in the Tuileries. I fear for your soul.<LF>-- Your trusted Counselor, Hervé LeGall

Successes<LF>II. Challenges<LF>III. Next steps<LF><LF>PART I. SUCCESSES<LF>While the general public remains content to generate amusing tornadoes of sound and fury over the basic facts of evolution, we have made such incredible progress in our study of the precursor Hominid species that it renders these minor squabbles utterly irrelevant. Our advances, achieved through decades of diligent research and ingenious experimentation by Abstergo's best and brightest, have finally led us to a full understanding of the teleological origin of our species. We are now prepared to embark on our THIRD major phase of research into our progenitor creators, Homo Sapien Divinius (H.S.D. hereafter).<LF><LF>The first stages of Abstergo's study of H.S.D. began with nominal efficiency in the 1950s following Rosalind Franklin's pioneering but censored discovery of Triple Helix DNA. Our scientists achieved further success in the late 60s with the discovery of the fossilized remains of four H.S.D. specimens near the base of Mount Kilimanjaro. Evidence of this precursor race had already been the subject of speculation and rumor for many centuries before, but with modern scientific techniques we were able to confirm their existence beyond any doubts.<LF><LF>Phase two began in 1971 with the creation and funding of Abstergo's first official Precursor Habitation Expedition. By the end of that decade, seven large-scale Denisovan sites located in Europe, Africa, North America and Asia had been discovered and partially excavated. These discoveries were not made without setbacks, however, and the quality of the data was often questionable. But we entered the 1980s with no doubts as to their importance. It was at this time, too, that a concerted effort was made to recover as many tools, artifacts, and curios as possible from these and other sites.<LF><LF>Phase three has now been in full operation since 2004, guided by the explicit mandate to sequence an entire precursor genome by the year 2018. So far we feel we are in good position to meet that goal. In parallel with this project, an adjunct team has been tasked with the job of acquiring as many distinct samples as possible and extracting whatever useful genetic memories we can obtain. Their work, tangentially related to the sequencing project, will be invaluable in the long term as a source of advanced scientific and historical knowledge.<LF><LF>In conjunction with the H.S.D. genome project, additional teams have been tasked with sequencing the genomes of related species in the homo genus. To date, these teams have made the following progress:<LF><LF>Homo Sapiens Divinius (~04%)<LF>Homo Sapiens Sapiens (COMPLETE)<LF>Homo Neanderthalensis (COMPLETE)<LF>Homo Erectus (~17%)<LF>Homo Antecessor (~04%)<LF>Homo Ergaster (~13%)<LF>Denisova Hominins (~02%)<LF>Homo Habilis (~16%)<LF>Homo Sapiens Idaltu (~27%)<LF><LF>Initial reports indicate that at least some of these hominids, like us, owe their existence to the Precursor H.S.D. species. The genome of Homo Neanderthalensis (Neanderthals), for example, bears unmistakable signs of deliberate craftsmanship. Further archeological evidence indicates that Neanderthals may have been explicitly designed and built as a military or expeditionary force. Research into this field of study is in its infancy, but is ongoing.<LF><LF>PART II. CHALLENGES<LF>Progress with the H.S.D. genome has been slow since our project began in 2006 in collaboration with researchers at Rosalind Franklin University. As the functional half life of DNA is approximately 500 years, we are resigned to the fact that most remains of H.S.D. organisms will contain at best 0.625% of their original information.<LF><LF>Secondly, acquisition of actionable remains has proven difficult. We suspect one reason may be that the H.S.D. species, at the height of its cultural development in 80,000 BCE, had an almost universal preference for cremation over the elaborate burial rituals preferred by lesser hominids (ourselves included). We also know that, following the large-scale Toba extinction event, the H.S.D. species died off very rapidly as members of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens and Homo Neanderthalensis advanced at a startling rate. Further evidence indicates that these latter species dismantled and salvaged almost all precursor sites as a means of survival.<LF><LF>However, in recent months, we have discovered the existence of two potentially fruitful sources of intact H.S.D. DNA. One source has been confirmed recently: a recurring, though extremely rare breed of human male archetype born with enough Triple Helix DNA to account for 5% to 6% of his total genome. Colloquially called Sages by previous generations, these specimens – if captured alive, or with enough genetic material intact – would enrich our search for precursor DNA samples immeasurably. The second source is classified pending confirmation, but early results are promising.

<LF>ART III. NEXT STEPS<LF>The "Tactics and Strategies" committee advises the following courses of action in the near future:<LF><LF>1. Utilize Animus technology to locate humans with trace amounts of embedded Triple Helix DNA. As has been demonstrated by the findings of the late Dr. Vidic, crossbreeding between H.S.D. and H.S.S. did occur on more than one occasion. Average ranges in normal humans typically run from 0.0002% to 0.0005% of the total genome, while the DNA acquired from Subject 17 was an extraordinary 0.952%.<LF><LF>2. As mentioned in Part II, make all efforts to locate more "Sages." Living samples are preferred, but any remains younger than 3 or 4 millennia would give us a significant advantage.<LF><LF>3. Locating so-called "Blood Vials," purported to contain the preserved blood of Precursor luminaries, would also prove invaluable. It is not known how effectively the vials have preserved these samples, but they are nevertheless a promising source of additional information, especially if acquired in bulk.

There are currently NO plans to outsource or license this technology to other companies.<LF>*Worldwide simultaneous release, Fall 2014.<LF><LF>--DOs and DON'Ts--<LF>DO:<LF>*Use words and phrases like "Innovative," "Immersive," "Total Immersion", "Virtual Experience", "True history," and "The final frontier of pure entertainment."<LF>*Elaborate on our flagship virtual experience: "The Tragedy of Jacques De Molay" -- 14th Century France; Last of the Knights Templar; Action, Suspense and Adventure.<LF>*Tease our forthcoming features without naming names. Something like "Our forthcoming virtual experiences will explore all sides of history -- good and evil and all the shades in between."<LF>*Spark imaginations by asking journalists what time period THEY would like to visit. Ask them if they have any famous people in their ancestral line.<LF>*Emphasize SAFETY; "Safety is our priority. If this technology wasn't 100 percent stable, we wouldn't release it."<LF>*Expound on the core virtues of HELIX: History, Truth, Immersion, FUN!<LF>*Talk up the HELIX Core Team: Inspired, Hard-working, Experienced; 343 collective years of industry experience!<LF>*Talk up Abstergo Entertainment: The best and the brightest; a studio full of talent; the most talented and creative minds on earth.<LF><LF>DON'T:<LF>*Do not dignify any rumors about the disappearance of past Abstergo Employees with any kind of response. These rumors are scurrilous attempts to tarnish our company's reputation and should be brushed off with a simple "We don't respond to false accusations and crack-pot theories."<LF>*Do not mention "Data Tracking," "Cortex Monitoring," fMRI-Omega technology, "Hippocampal Shock", "Occipital ghosting", "Brain Death", "Server Bridges", "Rogue Programs", or "Erudito". These are industry terms what will only raise false alarms in the minds of muckraking entertainment bloggers from San Francisco. The last thing we need is a 60 point hyperventilating headline on the front page of some squawking tech blog proclaiming "ABSTERGO ENTERTANMENT IS TRYING TO KILL YOU."<LF>*Do not answer questions about Abstergo Industries or its subsidiaries, other than Abstergo Entertainment. Deflect questions of this nature with a simple "I'm here to talk about HELIX as an employee of Abstergo Entertainment," or just a simple "That's not my area of expertise, no comment."<LF>*Do not go into specifics about the nature of genetic memory. A simple "Each man and woman on earth carries around some portion of the collective memories and experiences of their ancestors. Abstergo's various technological breakthroughs in the past few decades have led us to a point where we are able to extract, organize, and replay these memories for the public" will suffice.<LF>*Never speak badly of past projects. Spin negatives into positives. E.G. If they say "The film 'Devils of the Caribbean' was a frightful mess of clichés, dime-store moralizing, and pandering stereotypes. Who thought this bucket of bilge water was a good idea?" You say "Certainly we realized very early in production that 'Devils of the Caribbean' would not be the ideal experience for everyone. But for those who want a fun, exciting, and lighthearted look at the Golden Age of Piracy, their ship has come to port."
<LF>DO NOT CONFIRM co-operative virtual experiences. You MAY say "This is technology we have definitely considered, and are looking into it as we speak." We will be unveiling this feature at a later date.

Melanie Lemay<LF>Chief Creative Officer<LF>Abstergo Entertainment<LF><LF>15 March 2014<LF><LF>To Whom It May Concern,<LF><LF>In furtherance of the ongoing investigation of the late John Standish, former Information Technology Director at Abstergo Entertainment, I have been asked to provide a short reminiscence of our working relationship with the hope that it may shed some light on his bizarre actions immediately preceding his death in November 2013.<LF><LF>I should begin by saying that I did not know John well. His time at Abstergo Entertainment was brief--7 months, 3 days, to be precise--and in that time our friendship was almost exclusively professional. We attended the same directors' meetings and often found ourselves on the same side of longstanding discussions about this or that project. The subject of these conversations was always work-related--professional, appropriate, nothing out of the ordinary.<LF><LF>On two occasions only did I see him in what could be called "social circumstances." The first was in June 2013 on the evening of Abstergo Entertainment's yearly assembly, held that year in a riverside park in the heart of Montreal's Old Port. I remember it was a lovely evening, and very hot so the lines for the bar were quite long. At some point, I too was waiting in a queue for another glass of white wine for myself and a beer for a friend when I realized John was standing just behind me.<LF><LF>He said hello and we discussed the various bits of news Olivier had just announced at the assembly meeting. Then our talk turned to more personal subjects. I remember he said he was from the United States, born in a small town in Maryland, the name of which escapes me. I asked about the peculiarity of his accent and he thought it had something to do with the amount of traveling he did with his family. He hinted at a rather lonely childhood, with few stable friendships, though he laughed this off as though it no longer bothered him.<LF><LF>Our conversation then drifted to generalities about our current projects. I was, in those summer weeks, still in preproduction for the Sample 17 project, and told him things were proceeding well. He then asked me if Abstergo Entertainment had access to any of the old Animus 1.28 models. I told him I didn't think we did, as these models were not Helix compatible and were therefore of no use to us at Abstergo Entertainment. He said that was too bad, and when I asked him why, he said something to the effect of "I'd love a quick trip through my own messy past."<LF><LF>This didn't strike me as odd at the time -- at one point or another, most of our employees express a desire to peek into their own genetic memories. But I had to disabuse him of any ideas that this was a possibility. "Abstergo has a very strict screening process," I told him. "We take donations of gene material, yes, but the actual live sequencing process is done by trained professionals only. The Animus is a tool, not a toy." After listening to my explanation, he said again that it was too bad. When I suggested he donate his genetic material to the company anyway, he said nothing and wandered away from the queue. I noticed he hadn't taken any food or drink at all.<LF><LF>The second occasion was not so much a meeting as it was a sighting. It was on a Saturday in Montreal, at some point in the late Summer. I was walking down Parc towards Sherbrooke when I decided to stop by my favourite café for a drink. While waiting for my coffee, I happened to notice John was there too, sitting by himself in a far corner of the establishment, hunched over a small laptop and staring at the screen intently. His face was very flushed as streams of tears ran down his face. He looked distraught, as if a close relation had died and he had just heard the news.
<LF>As I waited, watching him intermittently, I realized that he was talking to someone, most likely via video or voice chat. This was not so unusual, of course; yet the manner of his speech was very odd. His conversation, from the little I could make out, seemed to be filled with joy and happiness even as his expression was one of a man being tortured to the limits of endurance.<LF><LF>Deciding against a quick "hello," I grabbed my coffee when it came and moved to the exit. Unfortunately, I could not resist a final peek at my colleague--I wish I had not paused.<LF><LF>Turning again to the back of the room, I found John staring directly at me. All emotion had drained from his red, raw face. His expression was blank, yet his eyes were fixed on me, boring like two screws through my skull. I exited the café as quickly as I could.
<LF>When I saw him at work the following week, he greeted me in his same laconic fashion. I said nothing about seeing him at the café and neither did he. We spoke only a handful of times after that, the last time being outside the Helix server room in A.E.'s lower "bunker" area. We argued about the employees we had recently detained on suspicion of espionage. I didn't see him again, and he was dead soon after.
<LF>Apart from these details, I have only generalities to offer. He was an odd man, but no stranger than most of the more technically-minded employees here. He was known to mumble to himself quite frequently, though I never witnessed this behavior myself. He was somewhat arrogant and haughty, but this again was not so unusual for his line of work, especially for a man whose intelligence and talent were not in question. He was undoubtedly skilled and had a technical aptitude that surprised even some of our most senior Technicians.<LF><LF>If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact me.<LF><LF>Melanie Lemay<LF>CCO-Abstergo Entertainment

"EVOLUTION BY NATURAL MISDIRECTION"<LF>A Public Impression Management Primer<LF><LF>by Dr. Alvero Gramática
<LF>In a lecture delivered last autumn at the Council's annual strategies and tactics meeting, I opened with a simple question, "How much should the public know about the truth of human origins?" The discussion that followed, led by myself and Mr. Rikkin, was lively and covered a broad field of topics. In general, a consensus was reached on the following point:<LF><LF>*It is NOT in the public's best interest to have any confirmation whatsoever of the hyper-hominid species (H.S.D.) that predates our own. To positively confirm that our own species was quite literally born in an ancient laboratory operated by a race of intellectually superior hominids would have a corrosive effect on society as a whole. The damage it could do to basic social cohesion would be catastrophic in many parts of the world, and it would jeopardize the success of many of our ongoing information campaigns.<LF><LF>If enough proof of the Precursor species were to rise above the level of conspiracy-tinged theories, our preliminary studies indicate that non-religious and liberal citizens of faith would likely go to great lengths to discover more about this strange and startling fact, while those with fanatical devotions to various faiths would likely a) violently oppose such basic truths with potentially destructive or dangerous consequences, or b) transfer the full bounty of their faith onto the Precursors. We have already seen this latter scenario play out through reports of a group calling itself the Instruments of the First Will, a radical group of theofascists who preach, among other ideas, the natural inferiority of our species in the face of any superior species.<LF><LF>To wit--<LF><LF>DEDICATED DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS to foment, encourage, and sustain an array of conspiracy theories tangential to actual historical and scientific facts are a NECESSARY component of keeping the existence of both the H.S.D.. fossil record and our genome sequencing project a secret.<LF><LF>Current ongoing disinformation campaign codenames include: "HOT OR NOT?"(Global Warming and Climate Change), "OPERATION COSMIC TURTLE" (Geocentrism), "SPARE CHANGE" (Evolution by Natural Selection), "G.T.U.F.O" (Extraterrestrial Life),"FOOLS GOLD STANDARD" (Federal Reserve System). We propose a system of co-ordination between some of these campaigns to ensure that all interest in precursor fossils and sites is misdirected down harmless, somewhat fantastical avenues.<LF><LF>Further recent efforts have been made to paint our adversaries in a less than positive light, in order to give their sporadic interactions with the First Civ a crazed, "cultish" veneer. Last year Abstergo Entertainment opted to pass over various assassin biographies as "too controversial" for the mass market. However, executives at Abstergo industries countermanded these decisions, feeling that it was in our best interest to turn the public against the Assassin cause, instead of pretending they do not exist. The truth will out, as it always does. So it is critical that we are in control of the narrative when it does. The first handful of these virtual experiences will debut soon.<LF><LF>KEEP IN MIND: The vast majority of conspiracy theories -- while aggravating to our rational minds -- are a critical part of our governing policy. There is a certain delicious irony in the fact that adherents to these various theories -- men and women who believe themselves to be courageous archeologists of hidden Truths -- are in fact our first and best weapon AGAINST actual fact-finding and rational thinking.<LF><LF>The noise they generate in pursuit of so-called "simple truths" through grand unifying theories of everything is a necessary component in our bid to obscure the incredibly complicated and interconnected nature of actual history. Simplicity, therefore, is a necessary component of all disinformation. Swear by it.<LF><LF>Therefore -- A) Always encourage investigations of trivial but anomalous data-points. B) Direct attention TOWARDS specific instances and AWAY from general trends and patterns. C) Always INSIST that some simple truth is being obscured, even when the reality of a situation is incredibly complex with many inter-dependent facts.<LF><LF>Additional business:<LF><LF>*We settled on the name PHOENIX PROJECT as our code name for the H.S.D. genome sequencing endeavor. In light of this, our disinformation campaign to obscure the true facts of this endeavor will be known as "PHOENIX RISING."<LF><LF>*The next Council meeting has been pushed forward by 6 months to ensure progress on this most important endeavor. We will meeting in Brussels, Belgium on June 6th, 2014, to coincide with that other event, since most members of the council will already be present.<LF><LF>Until then, contact Laetitia if you have any questions.

*** LEVEL V SECURITY CLEARANCE ONLY ***<LF>*** IT IS A FEDERAL AND INTERNATIONAL CRIME TO READ OR POSSESS THESE DOCUMENTS WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION--UN Charter, Special Appendix C (NGO and Corporate Benevolence Waivers) ***<LF>*** VIOLATORS WILL BE PUNISHED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW ***<LF><LF>Àlvaro, here's an updated list of genetic memory fragments and textual sources that refer or belong to known Hyper-Hominids (AKA Sages). Please note that this list does NOT imply that we have sufficient genetic memory data to directly access these experiences, only that we have located potential hotspots for investigation. There have been a handful of other references to Sages and so-called "Immortal Beings" throughout history, but I have not listed those with insufficient specificity.
<LF>The list is in reverse chronological order, beginning in the present and receding into the past.<LF><LF>*John Standish. Born: 16 August 1975. Status: Subject DECEASED. Samples extracted, body preserved.<LF><LF>*"David Jones". Nationality: Possibly English. Born: Mid-20th century. Status: Unknown. In the 1970s and 80s a few scattered reports of a man resembling a Sage surfaced. He was said to be "otherwordly," "extraterrestrial," and "possessed by multiple personalities." So far these reports have proved inconclusive.<LF><LF>*Name Unknown. Nationality: Indian. Born: ~1885, India. Status: We have a lengthy series of memories that take place during the creation of the Indian National Congress in which a Sage is reported to appear. As yet, however, we have had no direct confirmation. Our search is ongoing.<LF><LF>*Name Unknown. Nationality: French. Born: Early 18th century, France. Status: We currently have enough genetic material extracted from Samples 123355, 422356, and 777561 to adequately investigate this lead. Our search is about to ramp up.<LF><LF>*John "Bartholomew" Roberts. Born: 1682, Wales. Status: Killed and disposed of by the Assassin Edward Kenway in 1722 off the coast of Africa. His body was never recovered. We are currently searching for genetic memories belonging to members of his crew and those who knew him well.<LF><LF>*Thomas Kavanagh. Born: 1652, Boston. Status: Our knowledge of Mr. Kavanagh comes from our research into the life of Edward Kenway, gleaned from a series of letters collected over an eight-year period in the early 1700s. It is believed Mr. Kavanagh passed away somewhere on the northern shores of Jamaica at some point around 1706, but no intact genetic material has ever been recovered from this Sage or from people who knew him.<LF><LF>*Name Unknown. Born: Late fourteenth century, China, Hongwu Emperor's reign. Status: Multiple references taken from three separate text sources contain descriptions of a probable Sage living in the early period of the Ming dynasty. All three sources refer to this Sage as a "Confucian scholar" and member of the Emperor's court.<LF><LF>*Name Unknown. Born: 6th century Byzantium, during Justinian's reign. Status: A fragmented series of memories from a Christian Bishop point to the possibility that a member of his congregation was a Sage. We are currently mining for further memories from this period.<LF><LF>*"The Wanderer". Born: Judea. Status: Believed to have encountered Christ en route to Golgotha. All references to this Sage are anecdotal however. Awaiting further information.

Doctor,<LF><LF>Your concerns regarding the Observatory have been noted and I am inclined to agree. However, my status as Guardian requires that I first confer with my two colleagues, after which point we will pass our judgment on to the General of the Cross. If he/she has any concerns with your proposal, you will be apprised within the week. If you hear nothing by August 2nd, 2014, proceed as you see fit.<LF><LF>If we do proceed with your plan, I will contact our Grand Masters in Cuba, Mexico, and the United States to get a read on the situation. With luck the site will be undisturbed. This is probably wishful thinking and there is a good chance the Assassins still have some sort of surveillance over the site. As we discovered last year in the course of our Kenway investigation, the Caribbean brotherhood appointed a small faction to protect the location at some point around 1723. We don't know if their stewardship is still ongoing.<LF><LF>To echo your sentiments from our last discussion, I too believe the missing blood vials are of critical importance to our current Phoenix Project. Locating these will be a boon. But we should not ignore the value of the Skulls as well. In canny hands, the technology found in the Skulls could lead to another organization cracking the genetic memory code.<LF><LF>Our estimates say we will control Animus technology for 13 years at best, but it's only a matter of time before our technology is stolen, compromised, and distributed. We know the Assassins have long had access to critical pieces of our technology, but they have not cracked the puzzle of Surrogate DNA -- how to extract it, how to sequence it, etc. We need to ensure that does not happen for a long, long time.<LF><LF>Then there's that OTHER problem... but I'm waiting for a full analysis to fully understand exactly what SHE is, and what she is capable of before going into panic mode. At the very least we know she is capable of rather grand disruptions around the world... so keep your security tight.<LF><LF>We'll be in touch.<LF><LF>--AR

<LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>f course, hello. I'm glad you caught me, I was about to head into an experiment.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Well, I just wanted to give you an update. The list of Sage references I gave you last week... we found a few more leads I want to investigate, and I wanted your opinion.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>reat. Shoot.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Okay... ah, we checked the Sample 17 lineage like you asked, but didn't find anything promising until we went back to Europe in the 5th century CE. Faint echoes of a bloodline Sage some time around the height of the Hun Empire.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>mm. It would be difficult to find an intact sample that far back.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Yeah, I thought the same. Let's see... Another sample we checked came from a local Montrealer. That sample revealed an ancestor named Arno Dorian from Revolutionary France. Arno wasn't a Sage himself, but initial reports suggest he may have come into contact with one.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>m. That's promising, but not ideal. I'd rather find a bloodline Sage, not someone who met one. What else?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Ah, one more. A singer named David Jones from England, mid 20th century. No further details on this one though.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>etter, but the name David Jones... that could be any one of a thousand people.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>That was my worry, too.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>et's look into the Frenchman... it's possible we could find something.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Good. I'll put him on the backburner though. We have other leads I'd like to follow first.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>hatever you think is best.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Thanks, Àlvaro. I'll keep you posted.

RECONNAISSANCE REPORT<LF>Filed by: Otso Berg<LF><LF>*23 May, 2014. Flight into Kingston was smooth. Customs a breeze. No hassles. Calling G.M. to confirm expedition on the 25th is a go. UPDATE: We are on schedule.<LF><LF>*24 May. Traveled from Kingston overland to Montego Bay, travel time 5 hours, multiple stops. Met G.M. at his home. Dinner @ 19h30. Discussed plans. heading for bed, just before midnight.<LF><LF>*25 May. Set out this morning at 10:30am in three separate trucks to site location. Based on geo-tagged data taken from multiple Sample 17 archive files, we fixed on a position within 20 meters of LAT: 18.446846, LONG: -78.004086. The area is lush with vegetation and trees, with a few well-maintained roads nearby. The site we have settled on is a few hundred meters from the nearest road.<LF><LF>*11h43. After 1 hour of searching we have located an earthen mound whose layout bears some resemblance to the structures observed in the Kenway footage provided to us. Digging will commence at 1pm.<LF><LF>*18h46. We have made visual confirmation that this site bears traces of Precursor architecture. However, we have also come to the conclusion that the magnitude of our task is too immense for manual tools and have made arrangements for two backhoe loaders. Delivery is expected tomorrow morning no later than 10h.<LF><LF>*26 May: Backhoe loaders have arrived late following a confrontation with the proprietor of the rental company: our scanners found active GPS devices on the vehicles, a safeguard against theft, no doubt. When we requested that the devices be turned off--citing "sensitive archeological concerns," the man refused. A decent quantity of cash reversed his objections. Digging began just after lunch.<LF><LF>*27 May. We have located what appears to be the entrance to one of the false rooms of the compound. Nothing of import was located here, save a small glass bottle dating from the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century. The bottle was empty.<LF><LF>We will refocus our efforts tomorrow. In the meantime however, we dwell on this: Based on our examination of the accumulated vegetation and various soil samples, we have come to the conclusion that this site was deliberately buried between 200 and 230 years ago. None of the accumulated earth here is natural. This may suggest a radical shift in the Assassins' "Stewardship" strategy or a necessary response to increased Templar interest in the site.<LF><LF>*28 May. Multiple setbacks. One backhoe in need of repairs this morning, then heavy rains for a brief spell. Mud everywhere.<LF><LF>*29 May. Progress at last. We have located the primary entrance to the Observatory a dozen or so meters to the west of the first false entrance. Unfortunately we were not able to proceed farther than five meters, as an impenetrable mound of rubble and stone has blocked our progress.<LF><LF>*30 May. Ten straight hours of moving rubble, and no end in sight. My preliminary diagnosis is dire. Based on the lay of the land west of our dig site--uneven, yet with a distinct declivity averaging 4 degrees for almost 100 meters--I have come to suspect that most if not all of the Observatory suffered a catastrophic collapse at some point in the 18th century. This may account for its burial, and why no further mention of it is made in our own archives past the beginning of the nineteenth century. More excavations will be necessary, but on a scale this skeleton crew is not equipped to handle. Arrangements are being made as I write.

Finding most of it hasn't been easy -- like plucking a five second radio broadcast out of a decades's worth of background radiation -- and it took us another few days to crack the cipher. But we're on to something, and now we have a good idea of what we're looking for. I'll keep you up to speed as we try to figure out who's behind it all.<LF><LF>--Violet

14. Security Breach Memo

Id: [0x0007DA9C]
ABSTERGO INDUSTRIES<LF>Operations, Historical Research<LF><LF>Àlvaro... I hope you're sitting down. This still was extracted from the Standish sample last week. The total video we have amounts to barely 2.7 seconds at 60 FPS from a total of 14 interlaced memories. But even with this obscure sample, I'm already getting butterflies in my gut. I pulled one frame from the video to show you how mangled the data is. But even at this quality some striking details emerge:
<LF>Note the guard-like figures, a full 20 inches taller on average than the humanoids nearby ... and clearly calling the shots. The architecture looks like some combination of Sumerian, Egyptian, and Babylonian... but the metals they're using are ultra-modern alloys. Elsewhere we see stranger architectural shapes. These structures have no modern precedent anywhere in the world, though the memory's geo-stamp gives us a location south west of the Hoggar Mountains.<LF><LF>Unfortunately, most of the geo-stamps on these images are confusing. Some point to a location in modern Jordan some 80,000 years ago, others to a few locations in Tanzania and Ethiopia. But so far, we haven’t been able to nail anything down with much precision.
<LF>Please call or email if you have any questions. I'm eager to talk and discuss our next steps.<LF><LF>--Isabelle

Chat Log: V.DaCosta@AbstergoInd.cor; M.Lemay@AbstergoEnt.cor<LF><LF>--Message sent at 3:27pm--<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: Mel. Got a minute?<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Sure.<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: You've been briefed on the security breaches?<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Broad strokes. I have a meeting @ 17:00 to learn more.<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA:  I'll be there. Just a heads up though--expect some panic.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: ??? What's going on?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: A new breach this morning. Something we've never experienced before.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Is it bad?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: Probably. Not sure yet. Someone slipped right through our firewalls with one of the most well coordinated attacks we've ever seen. Seventeen separate servers compromised simultaneously in perfect unison, each via completely separate backdoor programs.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Meaning?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: Meaning somehow a single entity was capable of launching 17 completely independent attacks rather than one attack on 17 targets--the equivalent of someone playing and winning 17 separate chess games in the span of a few seconds.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Assassins?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: I can't imagine how. They have good tech, but they're never so blatant and they never split their priorities. This was a massive data sniff perpetrated by a single person or small group.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: What did they take?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: They didn't TAKE anything, but they scanned almost everything. Genetic memory archives, precursor analyses, raw DDS data. Lots of things people on the outside shouldn't even know about. They were looking for something, but I can't be sure if they found it.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Could it have come from the inside?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: That's what we assumed. What makes the whole thing strange, though, is that the data seems to have been moved around Abstergo's servers multiple times over the course of the attack. Shuffled, reorganized, and most likely altered.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Meaning what?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: It's hard to explain. It's almost as if two parts of a single program--one on the inside and one on the outside--just... sort of "joined up" and came to life, so to speak.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Talk to me like I'm 5. What does that mean?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: It's going to sound nuts...<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Try me. I'm getting used to it.<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: It's almost as if some sort of rogue bot or AI program is actually "living" in the network, so to speak. Moving freely around our servers. And somehow it has found a way to slip in and out of our network without tripping our alarms. We only managed to notice this time because we were going over the packet logs one by one today.<LF><LF>--Last message sent at 3:34pm--<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: You there?<LF><LF>--Last message sent at 3:54pm--<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Sorry, I had to make a phone call. Your last message sent me spinning.<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: Thought it might. Any ideas?<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: One. I hope I'm wrong.<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: OK.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: Have you done any research into Digital Cognizance Imprints?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: I studied the Kaczmarek case about a year ago. Is that what you mean?<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: That, but possibly on a far greater scale. Are you coming to the meeting tonight?<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: Sounds like I should.<LF><LF>M.LEMAY: You'd better.<LF><LF>V.DACOSTA: K. See you there.

<LF>elanie, any progress with Arno?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Some, yes. But we don't have the right kind of talent here to sequence his memories fast enough.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>hat sort of talent?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>We've learned over the past weeks that Arno was an Assassin. A particularly talented one.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>h. A "gifted" one, you might say?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Yes. Mild precursor genes.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF> see. I think I understand. You don't have any researchers in Montreal capable of sustaining long periods in his memories?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Nobody. We had one researcher last year who was very talented. But it... it didn't work out. I think the episode with John Standish really shook everybody up.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>ell, don't stress your employees for no good reason. We have our own people working on traces too, so just focus on making quality entertainment for us.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>That's been my dream since I started here.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>nd you're making incredible strides. Did you see the latest write up?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>I did. Very flattering.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>ou see? The world wants this kind of entertainment, Melanie. Curated experiences taken straight from history. Naysayers like to bitch and moan about plugging in and dropping out... spending more time in virtual space than reality. But what if this virtual space WAS reality, hm? What if it was taken from actual history, our history, the story of humankind? How could that be detrimental?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>The educational possibilities are endless.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>ndless. Exactly.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Thanks for all your help in the past weeks, Àlvaro. It's been a rough start.
<LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>ou're doing well, Melanie. Very well.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Thank you.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>n fact, are you busy the weekend of April 17th?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>That's a few months away. I'd have to check my schedule.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>lan Rikkin is having a little party at his place in Cape Cod. He asked me to pass along an invite.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>My God, that's... I'd love to go. If I had plans, they're cancelled now.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>Laughs) Great. I'll tell him you'll be there, and we'll get a flight arranged. Do you need one ticket or two?<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Ah, one I think. Unless something exciting happens in the next two months.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA
<LF>reat. One ticket, Montreal to Boston, round trip.<LF><LF>M. LEMAY<LF>Exciting.<LF><LF>A. GRAMÁTICA

"Citizen Hennebert, the incident of the bullet through your window is the final straw. I'm sure you, as the target, are more cognizant than I that we cannot allow your life to be put in constant danger. The precautions you have taken do not appear to be adequate. As a result, the other leaders and I believe that we must bridge the chasm with the Montagnards. I advise you to invite Citizen Gerard and his wife to our weekly dinner. I will attend as well.

Notre-Dame de Paris

Id: [0x0007EE7B]
Notre-Dame de Paris is the foremost monument in Paris and the historic heart of the capital: its parvis is the point from which all milestones on the roads of France are measured. Built over the course of nearly a century, from 1163 to 1250, it was one of the first buildings in Europe to employ flying buttresses, which allowed for much higher and thinner walls around the choir and the nave. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Personally, the last thing I’d want near a choir is a thinner wall. Lock them in, then soundproof the bugger, please.
<LF>-<LF><LF>The flying buttresses also provide the support necessary for the inclusion of the church's famous and astonishing rose windows.<LF><LF>During the Revolution, the great cathedral was variously used as food storage and a church dedicated to the Cult of Reason (and later the Cult of the Supreme Being). Many of its greatest treasures were looted, and in 1793 an angry mob decapitated the statues of the biblical Kings of Judah that adorned Notre Dame, mistaking them for former Kings of France. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** This is what happens when the uneducated lose their heads.<LF>--<LF><LF>Only the ten great bells survived unscathed. The damage inflicted would not be repaired until 1845.

THE HAND OF SCIENCE

Id: [0x0007F04D]
Solve the untimely death of the respected professor.

Id: [0x0007F04E]
For one too many years, Professor Frison had been working in the shadow of his friend and colleague Professor Marcel at the chemistry department of Chemical Science School Eustache du Gary. When Marcel published an essay in the L’avantcoureur Journal that supported Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier’s discrediting of the Phlogiston Theory of Combustion and publicly refuted Frison's own theories, Frison's hidden jealousy hit the breaking point. Frison had only a few weeks prior published a paper supporting Phlogiston Theory. Knowing that Professor Marcel was highly meticulous, Frison stole his lesson plan for the next day and learned he was using sulfuric acid in an experiment to make Diethyl Ether. Though this compound is flammable, Frison knew Marcel would be very careful with the mixture. So while Marcel was tutoring at night, Frison swapped out the lab's bottle of sulfuric acid and replaced it with nitric acid, a highly explosive chemical. He then re-labeled the bottle, having painstakingly studied Professor Marcel’s handwriting. As a result, the next day Marcel inadvertently caused a minor explosion in his own classroom. Fatally injured, he dragged himself into the courtyard, all the while clutching a bible belonging to the Church of Saint Côme. Judging by his published feelings towards the church's priest he seemed to be implying the church played a role in his death. The truth was much closer to home.

A letter written by Charlotte Corday and addressed to the citizens of France:<LF><LF>"Address to the French, the friends of law and of peace:<LF><LF>How long, oh! miserable Frenchmen, will you be pleased with disorder and divisions? Long enough and too long have some factious men, some wicked men placed the interest of their ambition in the place of the general interest. Why, victims of their fury, do you destroy yourselves to establish their desire of tyranny over the ruins of France?<LF><LF>The factions explode on all sides; the Mountain triumphs by crime and oppression; some monsters drenched with our blood, conduct their detestable conspiracies. . . . . . We labor for our own ruin with more zeal and energy than we have shown in conquering liberty! Oh, Frenchmen, yet a little time and there will not remain of you but the souvenir of your existence!<LF><LF>Already the indignant departments march on Paris; already the fire of discord and civil war inflame the half of this vast empire; there is still a means of extinguishing it, but the means must be prompt. Already the vilest of the wicked, Marat, whose name alone presents the image of all crime, in falling under the avenging steel, shakes the Mountain and makes Danton grow pale. Robespierre, those other brigands seated upon the bloody throne, are enveloped in the lightning which the avenging gods of humanity only suspend, without doubt, to render their fall more glittering and to affright all those who would be tempted to establish their fortunes on the ruins of an abused people!<LF><LF>Frenchmen! you know your enemies, arise! march! Let the Mountain annihilated leave only brothers and friends! I do not know if Heaven reserve to us a republican government, but it can not give us a leader of the Mountain for master unless in the excess of vengeance. . . . O, France! thy repose  depends on the execution of the laws; I do not give a blow to them in killing Marat. Condemned by the universe, he is without the law. What tribunal will judge me? If I am guilty, Alcides was, when he destroyed the monsters! . . . . . . .<LF><LF>O, my country! thy misfortunes tear my heart; I can not offer thee but my life! and I return thanks to Heaven for the liberty which I enjoy of disposing of it; no person will lose by my death; I will not imitate Paris, (the murderer of Lepelletier de Saint-Fargeau,) in killing myself. I desire that my last sigh may be useful to my fellow-citizens, that my head borne in Paris, may be a sign of rallying for all friends of the laws! that the tottering Mountain may see its ruin written with my blood! that I may be their last victim, and the universe avenged may declare that I have deserved well of humanity! As to the rest, if my conduct should be looked at with another eye, I am little disturbed by it.<LF><LF>My relations and friends ought not to be disquieted; no person knew of my intentions. I annex my extract of baptism to show what the feeblest hand can do, led by a thorough devotion. If I do not succeed in my enterprise, Frenchmen, I have shown you the road, you know your enemies, arise! march, strike!<LF><LF>Charlotte Corday"

SHACK - Cleaver

Id: [0x00081C09]
A large and very sharp cleaver. Could be part of a set.

SHACK - Torn journal

Id: [0x00081C11]
The pages belong to a surgeon's journal. They show diagrams of the human anatomy. Several names of patients are crossed out. Could be potential murder victims.

Id: [0x00081C12]
SHACK - Leather straps

Id: [0x00081C13]
These look like the kind of leather straps worn to control a prisoner or a patient. They are caked in dried blood.

Id: [0x00081C34]
Bernard Lasalle (runs the asylum): He verified the authenticity of the release papers I found in the satchel. The released inmate described in the papers apparently had plans to become a fisherman. The asylum also had a patient escape just a few weeks ago.

Id: [0x00081C35]
Gilles Benoit (asylum inmate): This patient lost an arm due to infection. A surgeon visited the asylum recently to amputate. The body in the cemetery also looked to have very clean cuts, no hesitation.

Id: [0x00081C36]
Dr. Lenard Erny (surgeon): The journal from the asylum belongs to the surgeon. Looks like his assistant left it behind after sneaking off to conduct an off-the-books amputation at the asylum. Does not trust his assistant.

Id: [0x00081C37]
Thierry Dion (surgeon's assistant): Claims his boss is a terrible surgeon. Not saying much, other than he's taking on outside jobs for extra money.

Butcher’s knives. They look to be part of a set, though a large cleaver is missing.

Id: [0x00081C4B]
Leon Doiron (potential victim's husband): The missing woman's husband is in a panic. Says his wife had just gone to the butcher before she went missing. Seems genuine.

Id: [0x00081C54]
Edgard Duchamp (the butcher):The butcher mentioned someone came into his shop rambling about a corpse. He seems pretty relaxed and likes to fish. Hired a new assistant who is good with a knife.

Id: [0x00081C5A]
Simon Larue (butcher's assistant): Definitely not right in the head. Did not say much, but his boots were caked with sand.

Id: [0x00081C5C]
Byron Latour (fisherman): Admitted to finding the body and says it came from upstream. Says didn't know what to do with the body so he took it to the Asylum's graveyard. Claims he did not murder anyone but something is clearly twisted in his mind.

Arno recovered his watch and kept himself out of trouble... for now.

Id: [0x00083BB9]
A variety of chemistry and medical journals. Provides for extensive reading.

Id: [0x00083BBA]
M. De La Serre isn't home yet. Perhaps he'll arrive soon.

Id: [0x00083BBB]
Empty bottles, pots, and pans. Essentially anything a chemist would need to make tonic. The apothecary has been busy.

Id: [0x00083BBD]
M. De La Serre is dead, and Arno has been arrested for the crime.

Id: [0x00083BBE]
Arno has escaped the Bastille. Now to find Élise and figure out who killed her father.

Id: [0x00083BBF]
Having completed the Brotherhood's initiation, Arno is welcomed as an Assassin initiate.

Id: [0x00083BC0]
His training complete, Arno prepares to go after his first real target, Charles Gabriel Sivert.

Id: [0x00083BC1]
Sivert is dead, but he gave up a name: Le Roi des Thunes.

Id: [0x00083BC2]
Le Roi des Thunes makes his lair in the sewers below la Cour de Miracles. Time to take the hunt underground.

Id: [0x00083BC3]
Thanks to the Marquis de Sade, Arno has the weapon that killed M. De La Serre. He also has a name: François Thomas Germain.

Id: [0x00083BC4]
With Mirabeau's blessings, Arno is tasked to track down Germain and find out his role in the Templar plot.

Id: [0x00083BC5]
Germain was held hostage by a Templar named Lafrenière, who is planning something at Les Halles.

Id: [0x00083BC6]
Whatever Lafrenière's plan is, the next stage happens at le Cimetière des Innocents. Time to stop him.

Id: [0x00083BC7]
Lafrenière is dead, but something doesn't quite add up....

Id: [0x00083BC8]
It seems Lafrenière wasn't the new Grand Master after all. But who is?

Id: [0x00083BC9]
Whoever the new Grand Master is, he's turned his sights on Élise. It's time to join forces.

Id: [0x00083BCA]
The new Grand Master's identity is revealed: Germain orchestrated M. De La Serre's murder. Mirabeau must be alerted.

Id: [0x00083BCB]
Mirabeau is dead, poisoned by an unknown assailant. The killer must be found and stopped.

Id: [0x00083BCC]
Pierre Bellec lies dead at Arno's hand. The rest of the Council won't be pleased.

Id: [0x00083BCD]
The documents are secured and the Assassins are safe--if not Mirabeau's reputation. More importantly, Rouille's presence reveals a Templar hand behind the attack.

Id: [0x00083BCE]
Rouille is dead, but his assassination yielded another name: Marie Levesque.

Id: [0x00083BCF]
Grain shipments are being diverted and hidden by a Templar, Marie Levesque. Her plan involves le Palais Luxembourg somehow.

Id: [0x00083BD0]
Marie Levesque is dead, but the conspiracy keeps on going. The next name on the list: Louis-Michel Le Peletier.

Id: [0x00083BD1]
Arno and Élise escaped the mob and rekindled their relationship.

Id: [0x00083BD2]
Le Peletier revealed that Germain will be attending the King's execution personally. It may be the one chance to kill him.

Id: [0x00083BD3]
Germain has escaped, Élise has left, and the Council is going to want answers.

Id: [0x00083BD4]

Deputy Hennebert was targeted by the extreme left for being far too conservative an assemblyman. An attempt on his life lead him to hire Armand to protect him. A Black Office agent shot a hole in Beaudoin's window as a way to prompt him to seek a reconciliation. The Black Office then used the hapless Gedet as a go-between to arrange an innocent-looking dinner party with Assemblyman Gerard, also known as Black Office agent "Patriot". The Black Office further used its knowledge of Prince Rupert drops to embed a poison into Mme Gerard's necklace. By this means, the Gerard's were able to evade Armand's scrutiny. Mme Gerard pretended to break her necklace and Gerard pretended to try to fix it, while in actuality breaking the tail of the Prince Rupert drop, releasing the poison into Hennebert's empty wine glass.

"... What should one think of the Committee of Public Safety, or rather of its leaders? (For most of its members are so negligent that they can barely manage to attend Committee sessions for two hours of each twenty-four, are unaware of almost everything that is done there, and doubtless are at most guilty of accepting a task they have no desire to fulfill.) But the leaders are plain criminals for having carried out so shamefully their functions. There is one among them, whom the Mountain has just foolishly reappointed, and whom I regard as the single most dangerous enemy of the country: Barère, indicated by Sainte-Foy to the king as one of the Constitutionals to be relied upon. Personally, I am certain that he keeps a foot in both camps until the victor is clear; it is Barère who has paralyzed every forceful measure, leaving us helpless, our throats waiting to be slit. I call upon him to contradict me in such a way as to finally show that he is not a royalist in disguise."

Id: [0x000847B1]
Woman, Valérie Duclos, in her 40s. Extremely well dressed in the old fashion of the monarchy. Face contorted into a horrible expression. No indication of physical violence.

Woman's ring discarded in shrubbery. Upon close inspection, one pearl is revealed to be a removable stopper for a tiny hidden vial. The vial is empty save for a drop of a sticky, clear, odorless liquid.

A crumpled letter found on the floor. It appears to be from a legal firm.<LF> <LF>***<LF>My dear Mme Duclos<LF> <LF>     I myself was witness to the signing of your late husband's last will and testament only a few months before his death. He left the sum to be managed by his friend Georges Villiers-Segonzac, with the bulk of the estate to go to your son, Pierre. We discussed the matter over cognac, and he seemed most reasonable.<LF>     Madam, I would thank you to not call into question my thoroughness and professionalism. Neither your husband nor M. Villiers-Segonzac disclosed the document you have brought to light. I prefer to think they were unaware of its existence.<LF>      Regardless, the document appears to be genuine and gives you an undisputable claim to the assets. There is, however, one obstacle to your stated desire to take immediate and direct control of the inheritance: The law dictates that women may not manage their own financial affairs. Therefore, M. Georges Villiers-Segonzac continues to hold complete authority over the entire fortune despite the fact that the assets have always belonged directly to you and never to your husband. As long as M. Villiers-Segonzac is active, your husband's will dictates that he, and not yourself, stands as the the one who controls the fortune.<LF><LF>     Please accept my most sincere regards and esteem, <LF>-- Maxime Siquotie

The safe contains an ancient document has been thrown loosely on top of many others.<LF><LF>****<LF>   My mother, through her business, amassed a considerable personal fortune before her death, which she left entirely to me, her eldest daughter. To honor her, I declare a legacy to be passed to the eldest surviving female of my line born of the name Monvoisin.<LF>   My wealth is held in trust, with the income benefitting my heir directly. As one heir dies, it passes to her eldest daughter or, if none, her eldest sister or, if none, her eldest female relation.  <LF>   In addition, the heir must take ownership of my mother's commonplace book and her collection of glass rings and necklaces, the judicious use of which is essential to the success of the enterprise. Indeed, what these items represent is more powerful than any wealth.<LF>   I declare these to be my wishes upon my death.<LF>- Marguerite Monvoisin<LF>Belle-Ile-en-Mer, 1692

An old book bearing the name La Voisin on the inside cover. A marked passage reads:<LF>***<LF>"I obtained this recipe from my a close friend who in turn obtained it from a relation, whom is reputed to have received it from a certain Italian gentleman, proving its authenticity. It produces a liquid devoid of color, smell or taste that demonstrates the desired result within mere minutes. Many have sought the secret I am about to divulge. Guard it well."<LF>***<LF>The passage continues with an involved process in which arsenic, belladonna leaves and lead powder are reduced to form a clear, odorless liquid. There are marginal notes made in several hands in faded ink.

Id: [0x000847BA]
A note, apparently to Pierre from his mother, Valèrie, left on a table:
<LF>--<LF> "My son, I write to caution and admonish you as to your conduct. I appreciate that since the death of your father, you have enjoyed considerable financial freedom due to his foolishly generous bequest as regards yourself (whereas I have had to made do with a pittance). Your Aunt Amélie recently discovered a document that makes it quite clear that it is I that should have obtained control of my family's fortune upon the death of your father, despite the ludicrous claims of our doddering "executor" who squanders our money in his foolish business dealings in the Orient.
<LF>  You simply must quell your extravagances--especially in regards to the vulture-like woman you consort with--in view of the fact that I will shortly obtain control of the entire inheritance. Whatever debts you have incurred will thereupon be yours and yours only. <LF>   Don't delude yourself that Amélie will come to your rescue, despite the fact that you have been foolishly generous to her. The money comes to me. She will have a small maintenance and can continue to wear Mother's worthless jewelry. She does not understand the value of money, and the less of it the better for her."

The Templars have procured a rubbed transfer of the missing section of the Rosetta Stone. Friend of the Brotherhood Jean Francois Champollion informs us that this rubbing contains sensitive information concerning the Assassins. However, the rubbing has not yet been translated. Understanding its importance, the Templars have split the rubbing into three sections. Champollion knows their whereabouts. Go to Champollion near the Luxembourg Gardens and use him to help you recover the three-part rubbing before the Templars learn its contents.<LF>-The Council

The butler claims to have not gone upstairs. I should ask him about the handkerchief.

Id: [0x00084F9F]
The butler claims to have not gone upstairs. This handkerchief belongs to the maid Émilie. I can find her at the shops down the street.

Id: [0x00084FA0]
OFFICE - Scrap of paper

Id: [0x00084FA1]
M. Mirabeau was known to be kind to his staff. If what the butler says is true, I can’t imagine him risking his livelihood.

Id: [0x00084FA2]
Émilie the Maid

Id: [0x00084FA3]
So Quemar did indeed visit M. Mirabeau earlier, but Émilie mentioned Élise as well.

Id: [0x00084FA4]
A lesson plan: <LF>"Today's Experiment: Mixing Sulfuric Acid with Ethanol to produce Diethyl Ether, a fascinating and useful compound used as anesthetic by Field Surgeons. Important - caution students to never mix NITRIC acid with ethanol! Stress that an explosion will result."

Id: [0x00084FA5]
I may have jumped to conclusions. I don’t think she's responsible.

Id: [0x00084FA6]
The table is covered in vials filled with a variety of chemicals. They are all neatly labeled as either "Ethanol" or Sulfuric Acid", except the largest bottle of sulfuric acid, whose label is crudely placed and peeling.

A manifesto written by Professor Marcel, it begins: <LF>“As a youth I may have been immune to logic, continuing to follow the church as a blind sheep to slaughter. But with age, the hand of science reached out to me, and freed me from perpetual ignorance.

Id: [0x00084FD4]
A scrap of paper. The word “Sulfuric Acid” has been handwritten in a variety of styles.

Id: [0x00084FD9]
Lionel Viala (student of the victim): He seems shocked at the death of Professor Marcel. He claims Marcel was only a tough teacher because he cared deeply for his students.

Id: [0x00084FDA]
Professor Frison (colleague of the victim): He both roomed with Professor Marcel and shared an office with him for several years at Chemical Science School Eustache du Gary. Claims he's in complete shock.

Id: [0x00084FDD]
Father Carriveau (priest): To say that the Father dislikes Professor Marcel is an understatement. Marcel injected his own thoughts on religion in his lectures, and made enemies of the church as a result.

Id: [0x00084FDE]
Deacon Manon (assistant to the priest): The deacon saw Professor Marcel and Father Carriveau arguing often. He also noticed Marcel was working late yesterday.

Id: [0x00084FDF]
Georges Brion (school caretaker): The caretaker at the school seems to be fond of Professor Marcel, mostly because he cleaned up after himself. Looks Like Marcel roomed with Professor Frison one floor up from the classroom.

Id: [0x00084FE0]
Élise

Id: [0x00084FE1]
Everything here points to Templar involvement. Something's not right here.

MARAT'S HOUSE - Jean-Paul Marat's body

Id: [0x00084FF0]
The body of Jean-Paul Marat. He’s slumped in a bath with a small, single puncture wound above the clavicle. His skin is mottled with pus-filled sores.

Id: [0x00085000]
Jacques-Louis David: The famous painter seems more concerned with perfectly capturing Marat's death than how he died.

Id: [0x00085008]
Gregoire Brousseau (apothecary): He treated Marat, who himself was a capable physician. Marat had developed a skin condition after hiding in the sewers below 23 Rue de Touraine.

Id: [0x00085073]
Mathieu Pinson: The merchant claims a woman entered his shop and bought the knife that killed Marat. She was looking for a hotel, possibly a place to hide. He does not remember the hotel's name.

Id: [0x00085074]
Jacqueline Perel (neighbor to the victim): Marat's neighbor says she saw plenty of women come in and out of his home.

Id: [0x00085075]
Madeline Leclair: A supporter of Marat, devastated by his death.

Id: [0x00085076]
Chantelle Naves: The witness says they rounded up suspects and transported them to St. Germain Prison near the church. A solid lead.

Id: [0x00085077]
Albertine Marat (sister of the victim): Albertine does not seem to be grieving much. Looks like Marat disapproved of her lover and his revolutionary ideas put the family in danger. But is that enough of a motive?

Id: [0x0008507E]
Jasper Lasalle: This prisoner seems eager to lay claim to Marat's death. Looks like Marat shamed his father in a newspaper article. Very emotional.

Id: [0x00085080]
Simmone Evrard (Marat's wife): She seems unaffected by his death. Looks like he paid more attention to being a revolutionary than to his family.

Id: [0x00085085]
Charlotte Corday: She seems oddly calm and more than willing to take responsibility for Marat's murder.

Id: [0x00085086]
Theron Brignac: Claims he was sent to kill Marat by the Girondists but the job was already done. Does not recognize any names on the "List of Girondin Traitors," but told me to go to 39 Rue des Cordeliers and show the list to some Girondin leaders there.

Id: [0x00085087]
Dominique Bûches (senior Girondist): He does not recognize the names on the "List of Girondist Traitors." Still, he pointed out the first letter of each name spells the word "providence".

Id: [0x000850CB]
OFFICE - Body of Director Beaudoin

Id: [0x000850CC]
A middle-aged man, shot through the head in an apparent suicide. He still holds a fancy red pistol whose barrel lies in the deceased's mouth.

Id: [0x00085104]
BROTHEL - Statement of Micheline

Id: [0x00085105]
Micheline (Suzanna's friend): Claims Suzanna was a favorite of de Sade, who came around frequently. Claims she warned Suzanna about him. Noted that the objects in the room were typical of de Sade.

Id: [0x00085106]
BROTHEL - Statement of Anna

Id: [0x00085107]
Anna (prostitute): Noted that many men come through and, although she didn't see de Sade, it's possible he was there. Noted one customer stayed a very short time. Afterwards, two men arrived, but only one went into Suzanna's room.

Id: [0x00085108]
DE SADE VILLA - Statement of the Marquis de Sade

Id: [0x00085109]
Marquis de Sade: Admits to visiting Suzanna "with some frequency," but not on the night in question. Claimed his valet would provide an alibi. Noted the appearance of a young man who subscribes to de Sade's philosophies. De Sade recommended Suzanna to him.

Id: [0x0008510A]
DE SADE VILLA - Statement of the Valet

Id: [0x0008510B]
Valet (Olivier): Did not know de Sade's whereabouts on the night in question. Noted that de Sade is careless and could easily leave his personal effects anywhere.

Id: [0x0008510C]
LEATHER SHOP - Statement of the Leather Worker

Id: [0x0008510D]
The leather-worker (Jean-Marc): The whip was made by him. Supplies many things to de Sade. Mentioned student who wanted same items as de Sade, almost as if he worshipped de Sade. Delivery book has student's address.

Id: [0x0008510E]
STUDENT'S HOVEL - Statement of the Student

Id: [0x0008510F]
Student (Quentin Legris): Claims he went to see Suzanna but lost his nerve and left. Also claims to have heard two men talking. One of them said, "After it's done, come meet me in the courtyard at St. Nicolas des Champs and I'll pay you."

Id: [0x00085110]
CHURCHYARD - Statement of the Vagabond

Id: [0x00085111]

Friar Honoré: Believes Nostradamus is a prophet.

Id: [0x0008511C]
MONASTERY - Statement of the Abbot

Id: [0x0008511D]

Id: [0x0008511E]

Id: [0x0008511F]
Friar Benedict: Noted that the three monks dead in their beds were the elders of the order. They became ill after Friar Jean served them wine and went to sleep. When they could not be woken, Benedict went for a doctor. Upon his return, he found Friar Jean strangled at his desk.

Id: [0x00085120]
MONASTERY - Statement of Friar Joseph

Id: [0x00085121]

Description

Id: [0x00085156]
"I have found the perfect place to hide my little bauble - in the well out in the courtyard."

Id: [0x0008517C]
Adrien Piet (victim's boss): Philibert assisted an apothecary named Adrien Piet a few days ago who sent him to a local merchant at 9 Avenue de Saxe. Piet does not seem happy with the late delivery.

Id: [0x00085184]
Guillaume Pinard: It seems Philibert never reached the merchant. What is interesting is Pinard's curiosity for the Chartreuse I found in the catacombs. Seems the Carthusian monks make it and the Carthusian nuns of Couvent des Filles de l'Enfant Jésus are notorious for hiding it.

Id: [0x00085185]
Jérôme Tolbert (barkeep): Philibert was a drunk, and was cut off by the bartender last night. He is in plenty of debt and with no shortage of enemies. Philibert promised to pay the bartender off with Chartreuse to clear his tab. An odd method of payment.

Id: [0x00085197]
Antoine Danis: This drunk is pretty much useless. An expert at rambling.

Id: [0x0008519F]
Navarre Cavery: The lute player seems more concerned with playing for no one in particular than sharing information on Philibert.

Id: [0x000851A1]
Catherine Doyère: She says Philibert bought a few rounds for everyone in the bar last night. Claims he was going on about his sister, even though she thought he was an orphan.

Id: [0x00085236]
Yoann Alban: Quite indifferent to the fact his boss, Mme Beaudry, has not arrived for work. Alban cannot tell me if the bottle belongs to his shop as it has no label. He wrote down two addresses for me: his chemist, who's workshop is at 24 Rue du Gros Caillou and an apothecary, Samuel Maran, at 5 Quai D’Orsay.

Id: [0x0008523D]
Sister Sorel (nun): Piercing eyes and little patience. She admits the Bible I found next to Philibert belongs to the Couvent des Filles de l'Enfant Jésus, though they give them out for free. She certainly does not like me asking about the Chartreuse.

Id: [0x0008523E]
Noel Pommier (the gravedigger): Seems a little off. Claims he is missing some tools and that someone recently broke into the catacombs. Says he found a rosewood cross that matches the beads found next to Philibert. Strong chance the shovel is his.

Id: [0x00085252]
"Notable Events in Paris Society, vol XI"<LF>  A page is marked detailing the La Voisin poisonings of the previous century. It seems one Catherine Deshayes La Voisin and her daughter, Marguerite Monvoisin were involved.

Id: [0x00085256]
An unidentified dead man who looks to have been homeless. His clothes are ratty and reek of alcohol. The body itself clearly hasn't been dead long enough to smell so putrid. No clear signs of how he died though his eyes are bulging wide.

Id: [0x00085257]
Samuel Maran: Seems anxious, frustrated. Says the bottle at the crime scene belongs to Mme Beaudry's shop. He seems frustrated. His competition is using cheap ingredients to drive down their prices. Worth noting: he mentioned that if someone were to administer too much of Beaudry's tonic, it could kill.

Id: [0x00085258]
Nicolas Rochat (employee of victim): Slightly aggressive. Shows little care for Mme Beaudry. I can definitely confirm that the body is hers. She did not go to work today and her chemist seems quite pleased about it. Suspicious, as he's looking to join Samuel Maran at his apothecary shop. Could be a connection.

Id: [0x0008526F]
Mathieu Rochon: The witness heard odd noises outside his window. When he checked outside someone was carrying something large into the Tannery. He thought it was Citizen Gilbert, though it seems he was on vacation at the time.

Id: [0x00085278]
Citizen Gilbert (owns the tannery): Citizen Gilbert claimed he was on vacation at the time of the murder and that the body had been in the leather chemicals for at least a few days. He also pointed out the wound on the chest must belong to a custom blade. Seems the local gangs use them to leave a mark on their victims.

Id: [0x000852B9]
Citizen Touchet: The jeweler recognizes the victim's ring as one of his own. It was made for Warden Leroux, who helps run the prison at La Salpêtrière. He also gave me his home address: 43 Rue de l’Arbalete.

Id: [0x000852BA]
Mme. Camille (victim's wife): She believes her husband had made many enemies due to his day job. He'd apparently been missing for two nights before she told the police. She was concerned they would blame her due to her infidelity. Highly suspicious.

Id: [0x000852BB]
Julien Lamond: Mme. Camille seems to have had a boyfriend on the side. He says he was at her home to console her. Does not seem disturbed by the situation or concerned about what people think of their arrangement.

Id: [0x000852C0]
Genevieve Cerne (victim's neighbor): Neighbor says it was unusual for Leroux to be missing for two days. She claims that Leroux had run up some debts with the gang Les Marcheurs Morts. They can be found at the tavern, Le Creux: 27 Rue des postes.

Id: [0x000852C1]
MInette Rosier (victim's neighbor): This neighbor does not seem to have a lot of faith in the Warden's wife, Mme. Camille. Looks like her adulterous tendencies have made good gossip fodder around here.

Id: [0x000852C3]
Hugo Soulière (worked with the victim):The Deputy Warden seems to be in shock over the death of Warden Leroux. He came to work and found Leroux head placed on a pike outside the crematorium at La Salpêtrière. At least there is now no doubt who the body is. Deputy said goodbye to Leroux the day before. Looks to be eager to pin it on Les Marcheurs Morts, the gang Leroux had run afoul with.

Id: [0x000852C4]
Olivier Rivett: Barkeep claims he knows nothing about Warden Leroux. Just that he serves beer and that the leader of Les Marcheurs Morts is upstairs.

Id: [0x000852C5]
Danton Marotte (Leader of Les Marcheurs Morts): Danton was expecting me. He confirms Warden Leroux had debts with Les Marcheurs Morts. He claims he would not have done it because he was negotiating the release of some of his men with Leroux.

Id: [0x000852C6]
Romain Trottier: The blacksmith admits the blade was made by him. It is a custom make for the gang Les Marcheurs Morts. The marking of the "x" stands for "x marks the spot." I have a feeling someone from outside the gang bought the blade from him.

Solve the mystery of the noontime detonation.

Id: [0x0008553B]
In an effort to improve the manufacture of gunpowder needed by the Revolutionary Army, the Academy of Sciences began a competition. Gaspard Monge is the favorite to win it. Colonel Frolois, jealous of his competitor Monge, reunites with an old army camarade, Sergeant Saint-Bris, who loads the solar cannon daily. Frolois has realized that Monge's laboratory looks out over the Palais Royal gardens, and has discerned that Monge has dangerously stored casks of water directly above his vials of elemental potassium. Frolois, as an ex-soldier, knows his ammunition, and he swaps a live round for the blank that Saint-Bris normally uses. He then limps to the solar cannon in the dead of night and aims it at his rival's laboratory window. When the cannon goes off, the live round will pierce the window, knock the water onto the potassium, and the resulting explosion will permanently disrupt Monge's experiments. However, Frolois did not anticipate an innocent passer-by, Alexandre Loissac, arriving directly in front of the cannon for his noontime rendez-vous. Alas, Alexandre was killed and the projectile, slowed by its journey throught Alexandre's chest, failed to pierce Monge's window. Clever scheme foiled and innocent man killed.

Little information about François de la Serre survives. A minor nobleman, he kept an estate in Versailles and a smaller house in Paris, and was known to be a close confidant of the King and of Mirabeau. His wife, Julie, died sometime around 1777, and De La Serre was left to raise his daughter, Élise, on his own.

King Louis XVI

Id: [0x000859D9]
Louis was never meant to become king, but his father died in 1765, followed by his two older brothers. When his grandfather Louis XV died in 1774, he came to a throne for which he was ill-prepared. Louis and his wife would fail to provide France with an heir for seven years, to the derision of the French people. Even the celebrations of their wedding day would end in tragedy, with the death of one hundred Parisians following a stampede at a fireworks display. <LF><LF>An indecisive man, in the words of one deputy, "the king spent his whole life saying each evening that he was mistaken that same morning." As his younger brother (the future Charles X) would say, not without irony: "Trying to get Louis to hold to a position was like trying to hold greased billiard balls together."*<LF><LF>--<LF>* Amazing that phrase never caught on, really. But then trying to get a phrase to catch on is like oiling a hammer and expecting a cat to marry it.<LF><LF>You can use that one, if you like.<LF>--<LF><LF>His 19-year reign would become increasingly agitated since the Court was incapable of reform. Louis XV had merely covered up the nation's problems without actually resolving anything. His heir wished to be called "Louis the Severe" to contrast with the permissiveness and debauchery of his grandfather. But as far as public opinion was concerned, he would be "Louis the Weak". ***<LF><LF>--<LF>*** Never mind “Louis the Weak”. There were so many men called Louis around you could have had a “Louis of the Week”.
--
<LF>What decisions he actually managed to make turned against him. The war with England, to support Franklin and Washington, would ruin the kingdom, and by 1789, debt-ridden France had reached a state of virtual bankruptcy. This situation was exacerbated by the trade treaty with London: the British, who were way ahead of the French technologically, inundated France with their industrial products, spelling ruin for French artisans. Some of these products would even be used in the revolutionary riots. <LF><LF>While food shortages were due to bad crops and weather, those who were hungry blamed them on the rich. Meanwhile, pampered and pensioned in Versailles far away from their roots, the nobility had become another adversary that would further undermine the system. The same went for the lower orders of the clergy, who shared the general misery of their flock. The king didn't see it coming. The nobles would bring about a revolution to which they too would fall victim. <LF><LF>In summer of 1791, with the revolution heating up, Louis approved the perilous plan to secretly flee from Paris to the supposedly loyal troops in the East. The royal family's arrest at Varennes would spell the end of absolute monarchy. On August 10, when the grounds of the Tuileries were invaded, Louis took refuge in the National Assembly, but the damage was done. Shortly thereafter, he was stripped of his power, arrested, and sent to the medieval fortress of the Temple, and from there, to his doom. <LF><LF>His trial was brief, and ultimately only for show: witnesses who testified in his favor were massacred in two instances, while the documents that could have proved him innocent were not passed on to his defenders. In short, it was a travesty. The judges had all but decided on the verdict from the onset. <LF>The "absolute" monarch—who didn't even reign over his court—was influenced by all those who surrounded him. "What should I do?" he asked the reactionary French writer Rivarol in September 1789. "Act like a king!" came the reply. If only. Louis, who had a passion for geography and great exploration, and whose hobbies were locksmithing and carpentry, was simply not cut out for the job. ****

<LF>-<LF>**** In my experience, you should never trust a man who lists his hobby as locksmithing.<LF>--

Louis-Michel Le Peletier

Id: [0x000859DD]
Louis-Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau was born on May 29th, 1760, in Paris. Very promising, he became councillor of the Paris Parliament (before the Revolution, parliaments were judicial institutions and had no legislative function) in 1779; being under the age limit, he was admitted with special permission, most probably because of a Templar intercession. <LF><LF>Among other law-related activities, he climbed the ladder of that institution until 1789, when he was elected to the Estates General as a representative of the nobility. Pretty soon, he discarded his noble origins and supported the cause of the Third Estate. He then devoted himself to politics, even becoming for almost two weeks president of the National Constituent Assembly in June 1790. Being a lawyer, he took part in the writing of a draft of a criminal code, of which the most striking point is the abolition of the death penalty, but that idea is dismissed.**<LF><LF>--<LF>** Talk of the abolition of the death penalty, eh? In the eighteenth century? Never mind America – you’ll catch up one day.

Marquis de Sade

Id: [0x000859DF]
Donatien Alphonse François de Sade was born in 1740 He came from a typical noble French family, full of soldiers and clergymen, and entered the army at the age of 14. Apparently he didn't find it to his liking, because he left at the age of 31. De Sade was the quintessential black sheep: an atheist and great lover of the performing arts, he was above all a libertine, and used his family's wealth and influence to get away with an astonishing array of crimes. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Lucky that could never happen nowadays.<LF>--<LF><LF>It's a telling symptom of the Ancien Regime's corruption that he was considered merely a scandalous figure and not a violent criminal.<LF><LF>Much of his adult life was spent shuffled between different prisons, where he wrote numerous texts, nearly all of which were deemed obscene and heavily censored. He was liberated in 1790 and, sensing the change that was in the air, renounced his title and got himself elected to the Convention. He continued to write in the same pornographic vein, while simultaneously pardoning nearly every criminal sent before him. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** I had a headmaster a little like that for a while.<LF>--<LF><LF>His governmental tenure was short-lived: In late 1793, openly critical of Robespierre, he was arrested for "moderatism" and imprisoned for a year. He never rejoined the political sphere, and in 1801, under Napoleon's orders, he was arrested once again and sent to prison, where he would remain until his death in 1814, having outlived a monarchy, a revolution and an empire. ***<LF><LF>--<LF>*** Still. At least he had his naughty writing to keep him warm at night.<LF>--

Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau

Id: [0x000859E1]
Born at Le Bignon, Mirabeau suffered a virulent case of smallpox at a young age, which left his face scarred with pockmarks. His family was quite wealthy, and his father obtained for him a commission in the cavalry, but the Army was a poor fit for him. Young Mirabeau became embroiled in an affair with his colonel's wife; when the affair came to light, Mirabeau's father had him imprisoned on the Ile de Ré. He spent many years in and out of prison, always one step ahead of creditors (and, more often than not, angry husbands).
<LF>Later, while imprisoned at Fort de Joux, he seduced his jailer's wife and escaped with her. He settled in Amsterdam, where he became involved with various occult societies. Later arrested by the police, he was again imprisoned for three years in the castle of Vincennes, where he wrote dozens of texts in which he condemned the arbitrary nature of French justice, as well as an essentially pornographic text, Erotika-Biblion. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* At this point I should just say – this bed-hopping, war-dodging, erotica-writing anti-establishment gigolo sounds like the most French man ever. 
<LF>I mean, he took Frenchmanhood to whole new heights. <LF><LF>And when I say ‘Frenchmanhood’, I am talking about his level of Frenchness – not his French manhood.

A<LF>tually, I’m talking about that as well.
<LF>-<LF><LF>Once released from prison, his life changed when, in Neuchâtel, he met the "Genevese revolutionaries" in exile, including financier Etienne Clavière, who would play an important role in Paris. These talented men formed the foundations of Mirabeau's group and political reasoning; they wrote, he signed. This explains his prolific production (politicians have always used ghost writers). He attacked the banks in his texts in return for payment by another banker, thus allowing him to pay off his mountain of debt. He also attacked French minister Charles Alexandre de Calonne, which led to yet another lettre de cachet and his subsequent exile in Prussia, where he acquired the certainty that "the middle classes shall only be freed by joining forces with the lower classes." In any case, the nobility wanted nothing to do with this strange marquis. 
<LF>At the outset of the Revolution, he was elected to represent the Third Estate at the Estates General. For all that, the inspiration for his "political workshop" lay with his friends; Mirabeau, an exceptional orator, was merely their spokesman. <LF><LF>The remainder of his story is better known: his services were paid for by the King (as early as October 1789), even though the court never heeded his advice. Proof of his secret dealings with the King came with the discovery of the famous iron chest at the Tuileries Palace, containing, among other things, correspondence and a list of payments. However, by this time, he had already been in the grave for 16 months. Prior to his death, when his health, damaged by his excesses, had all but failed him, his last speech was delivered by Talleyrand, but in actual fact had been written by Genevese pastor Etienne Salonion Reybaz.

Napoleon Bonaparte

Id: [0x000859E3]
Had he be born a few weeks earlier, Napoleon would have been Italian. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* What a terrifying thought.<LF>--<LF><LF>He was born with the Italianized version of his name, "Buonaparte," on the island of Corsica which belonged to Genoa until the Genoese sold their rights to the French Crown. The skinny Napoleon had a difficult adolescence. Badly dressed and with a heavy Corsican accent, his rustic manners were out of place among the smart young nobles who attended the same military school as he did. The future emperor, the "booted jacobin," was a bad boy who was often absent: in six years, he notched up 38 months of leave for 33 months of presence under the French flag. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** So in fact he was quite Italian, then.<LF>--<LF><LF>In 1791, he spent several months in Corsica to help Pasquale Paoli, the Corsican liberator, who would go on to hate and distrust the "Buonaparte" family. He exceeded his leave of absence and was struck off on January 1, 1792. Although a civilian once more, he was promptly appointed colonel of a battalion of volunteers that would fire on demonstrators protesting against the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Without being ordered to do so, he took the citadel of Ajaccio. ***<LF><LF>--<LF>*** You say self-motivated, I say rude.<LF>--<LF><LF>Later, he took part in the revolutionary days of 20 June and August 10, 1792. His participation in the siege of Toulon (though he did not take the city all by himself) and his mastery of artillery gained him the admiration of Augustin Robespierre, younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre, who appointed him brigadier general and put him in command of the artillery of France's Army of Italy. <LF><LF>Following the failed royalist putsch of 13 Vendémiaire where, under the orders of Paul Barras (whose mistress he would go on to marry), he gunned down the Voltigeurs, he returned to Italy, this time as General-in-Chief. It was during the next four years that his life forever changed. Better than anyone, he knew how to exploit his victories and cover up his defeats for the sake of public opinion. In France, everyone remembered the Battle of the Pyramids (which he won), while hardly anyone remembered the Battle of Aboukir Bay (which he lost). Widely recognized by the age of 30, he sought neither to be an aristocrat, nor a revolutionary. When his mother reprimanded him one day, he famously replied: "io sono imperatore." In 1799, he affirmed "io sono Bonaparte." He had become second to none. He had also mostly lost his Corsican accent.

Maximilien François Isidore de Robespierre

Id: [0x000859E5]
Deprived of his father from a very early age, Robespierre was raised by Oratorians. He was a hard-working pupil with a passion for Roman history, which he would refer to almost obsessively in his later speeches. Trained as a lawyer and admitted to the Arras bar, he was destined for provincial mediocrity just as the depression broke out. On April 20, 1789, he was elected only fifth deputy (out of eight) of the Third Estate of Artois to the Estates-General. But he would soon conquer Paris, and would only ever return to Arras on one occasion. Over five years, he would speak out many times to various galleries: "We are being watched by all nations; we are debating in the presence of the universe." *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Fine for him to do. If I tried shouting that in public, they’d have me committed.
<LF>-<LF><LF>Despite his harsh voice and his Artois accent, he gained increasing attention.<LF><LF>Of his private life, we know next to nothing. He lived elegantly but without over-indulging himself. His was a life based on regular study and maintaining good company. He had an overzealous distrust that could be offensive to schemers and supplicants. In fact, he did not court popularity, and was all the more esteemed as a result.<LF><LF>Once in power, Robespierre quickly shed his moderate image, favoring extremism and terror as tools for rulership. After a reign that culminated in the Festival of the Supreme Being and the Terror, Robespierre lost the support of the Committee for Public Safety. His former allies turned on him, and he was deposed and executed. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** Can I just say that tickets to next year’s Festival of the Supreme Being and the Terror have already sold out due to popular demand.

After her father's assassination, Louise-Suzanne Le Peletier was officially named "Daughter of the Nation" by a grieving National Convention. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* That’s a hell of an adoption right there. “Sorry about your dad – anyway, literally everyone in France is your parent now.” Imagine the queue of people who’d have to pick her up at the school gates every day. Imagine all the cards she’d have to sign every bloody Mother’s Day.

In<LF>her later life, she was an ardent royalist and devoted considerable time and expense to recovering and destroying the famous painting of her father by the artist Jacques-Louis David. She died in 1829.

Jacques de Molay was born between 1245 and 1250. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Now that’s a long labour.
<LF>-<LF><LF>He was born no doubt in Molay, Haute-Saône. He was received into the Order of the Templars at the Beaune House in 1265. After the fall of Acre, a general chapter meeting of the order met in Cyprus in September 1291. He was elected Grand Master on April 20, 1292, and led the Templars to the height of power. Under his influence, the course of European history would change for the better.<LF><LF>In 1307, Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V concocted a scheme to destroy the Templar Order. King Philip, deep in debt to the Order, drummed up largely-unsubstantiated charges of heresy and blasphemy against de Molay and his followers. On October 13, coordinated raids ended with the arrest of nearly every Templar in France. On May 2, 1312, the Pope officially dissolved the Order and gifted all of its assets to the Knights Hospitaller. In March of 1314, Jacques de Molay was burned at the stake. With him died one of the great civilizing forces of Western Europe.<LF><LF>In 2001, researchers at the Vatican Secret Archives uncovered a document written in 1308 by Pope Clement which absolved Jacques de Molay of all charges. How the parchment was lost remains a mystery. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** Though I think we can agree it didn’t lose itself…

Thomas-Alexandre Dumas

Id: [0x000859F8]
Not to be confused with his son, the famous French author. This Alexandre Dumas (who also went by the name Thomas-Alexandre Dumas) was the son of a lesser French nobleman, Alexandre-Antoine Davy, Marquis de la Pailleterie, and a black slave, Marie-Cessette Dumas, in Saint-Domingue. The marquis returned to Paris with his son* in 1776. <LF><LF>--<LF>* Briefly selling young Thomas-Alexandre into slavery, possibly in order to get him into France legally. This is why you read these comments – I add the appalling historical details. Because I care. 
<LF>-<LF><LF>Dumas stood well over six feet tall and knew no fear. He joined the first battalions of the Revolution in the rank of Private, using his mother’s name to avoid family shame at being of such a low rank. (Men of noble lineage could enter directly into commissioned ranks, but it was difficult for someone of mixed race to do so**).
<LF>--<LF>** It’s fun to try to guess why! 
<LF>- <LF><LF>Dumas went on to have a dazzling military career, attaining the rank of General. He served as second-in-command to the Chevalier St-Georges in the ‘Black Legion’ (so named it was comprised of free men of color.) He later led the Army of the Alps as Commander-in-Chief.

<LF>nfortunately, later in his career Dumas found himself at odds with Napoleon Bonaparte. When he was captured and imprisoned in 1799, Bonaparte did nothing to secure his release, and Dumas returned to France ill and impoverished. He was denied a pension from the army, and died in 1806 at the age of 44.

Jacques Roux

Id: [0x000859FA]
Ordained in 1779, this son of an infantry lieutenant served as a lowly vicar in the diocese of Saintes. He encouraged those who took part in anti-feudal peasant movements to come to the parish to which he ministered. Promptly removed from his parish, the "red priest" took refuge in Paris. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Not the best nickname, is it? I mean it’s hardly the “Black Widow”. He just sounds like a permanently embarrassed member of the clergy. Which these days is many of them.
--<LF><LF>Roux would soon earn the moniker of "petit Marat." Preaching to the Cordeliers' club, his rhetoric became increasingly incendiary. He encouraged the looting of shops on February 25, 1793. All his actions focused on the issue of livelihood; the working class, the only one useful to society, was dying of hunger**. He petitioned for the punishment of speculators, usurers and employers who exploited their workers. <LF><LF>--<LF>**All of which sounds completely reasonable… which is why you need to keep reading.
<LF>-<LF><LF>On June 25, 1793, he proclaimed his Manifesto of the Enragés to the National Convention. He was booed out. By June 28, he was violently denounced by Robespierre*** who had him expelled from the Cordeliers. Marat also turned against him, denouncing him as a false patriot and a criminal in his newspaper, L'Ami du Peuple. No sooner had Marat met his death than Roux took over the newspaper. He lambasted the slowness of the guillotine**** and the absence of any real social measures. 
<LF>--<LF>***You have to admit, ‘Too crazy for Robespierre’ allows this gentlemen to take his place as a member of a rather… select group.
**<LF>* ‘The guillotine is slow’ is not a complaint you will have heard from many people of the time…
--<LF><LF>He would later be imprisoned at Sainte-Pélagie, where he continued to write his journal. He was removed to another prison, where he succeeded in stabbing himself mortally*****, on February 10, 1794. The "preacher of the sans-culottes" had failed to develop a viable political system, but had nevertheless been the voice of the oppressed.
<LF>--<LF>*****That’s right. He stabbed HIMSELF fatally. You know – the way people often stab themselves. No Assassins involved whatsoever. Just one of those violent and sustained self-stabbings.

Anne-Josèphe Théroigne de Méricourt

Id: [0x000859FC]
She was born Anne-Josèphe Terwagne, in Méricourt. An unsuccessful opera singer, she joined the revolutionary movement shortly after the storming of the Bastille. She was involved with the Women's March, and was in the crowd when the King was forced to pin a revolutionary cockade on his hat. 

<LF>éricourt cut a unique figure in a crowd, with her preferred outfit featuring a riding habit, man's hat, and pistols. In the early days of the revolution, she regularly attended the National Assembly, watching from the galleries, and following it when it moved from Versailles to Paris.

Marie Antoinette

Id: [0x000859FE]
Marie Antoinette (1755-1793) was by many accounts the most hated woman in the kingdom. "Pretty, frivolous, mocking", she more than made up for her matrimonial boredom with parties and lavish spending. "She's rushing towards her ruin" predicted her mother, Empress Maria Theresa. In fact, it was the war of America that would ruin France's finances, not her frivolity. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* To be fair, it would take quite some party to ruin France’s finances all on its own. That’d have to be a hell of a bar tab. Mind you, it is France…
--<LF><LF>In the spring of 1789, she encouraged the king towards a faltering and contradictory policy, believing that only foreign intervention would be the salvation of the crown: in fact it would be its loss. She refused the support of La Fayette and Mirabeau, pressed on with the plan for a royal escape, which resulted in the capture of the entire royal family at Varennes. On August 13, 1792, she was imprisoned in the tower of the Temple with her family after the invasion of the Tuileries. On August 1, 1793, she entered the Conciergerie. She was tried by the Revolutionary Tribunal on October 14. On October 16, she was sentenced to death for "high treason." The sentence was carried out later the same day.

Georges Jacques Danton

Id: [0x00085A00]
Georges Jacques Danton is a favorite subject of French school textbooks in which he is often portrayed generously, in spite of his turpitudes. In reality, he went from one failure to the next*. He held a subordinate office in the commune before the sections refused to promote him. Once the King had been escorted back to Paris after his capture at Varennes, Danton first called for his death, before retracting to merely call for the king's abdication.<LF><LF>--<LF>*ie. He was allied with the Assassins – meaning that of course the Abstergo historian will argue for his historical irrelevance.
<LF>-<LF><LF>He was not even elected to the short-lived Legislative Assembly in 1791. He made the most of his free time to engage in business, purchasing national assets and consolidating his fortune. He remained on the sidelines during the events of June 20, 1792, and later played no part in the preparations of August 10. Up until the battle of Valmy, this so-called minister of the people embodied France's regained audacity and patriotic unity**.<LF><LF>--<LF>**Note the use of the word “Audacity” – Danton’s famous for calling for ‘Audacity, more audacity, always audacity’ in the face of overwhelming odds against the Austrian Army in 1792. It’s credited for rallying the troops enough to save Paris. You may count a small thing like that as among his zero accomplishments.

Th<LF> Girondists condemned Danton’s management at the Ministry of Justice and his responsibility in the September massacres***. Suspected of playing on both sides, he would never render accounts**** after his time as Minister of justice. He was removed from the Committee of Public Safety after serving a mere few months***. Increasingly as the revolution went on, Danton called for the laying down of arms, proclaiming the need to spare the blood of men******. Robespierre and Saint-Just accused him of being excessively moderate, in other words, of treason. 
<LF>--<LF>***Far be it for me to say Danton didn’t have his flaws – among them, he actually did nothing about the September Massacres (He’s been accused of causing them, there’s no evidence of that and some historical debate as to whether he could have stopped the mobs.) 
***<LF> And money to the tune of 200,000 livres went missing while he was Minister of Justice.<LF>*****Not mentioned: he helped found the Committee.

H<LF>nriot was working as a tax clerk in the Paris octroi when, on July 12, 1789, angry Parisians attempted to set fire to the building to protest against taxes.

I mean, half his name is the word ‘riot’.

An "elected" commander of the Jardin des Plantes section, he led the storming of the Tuileries on August 10. <LF><LF>Hanriot — and others — organized the September massacres, offering a daily wage and free wine to the killers. By May 1793, he was appointed Commander General of the Paris National Guard***. He fought against the Girondists with such fury that Marat proclaimed him "the nation's savior". 

<LF>-<LF>*** Presumably for his unique brand of motivational management.<LF>--<LF><LF>Hanriot became one of Robespierre's henchmen. When he was later captured along with other radicals of the Enragés, Robespierre came to his rescue.

During the American Revolutionary War, Paine’s pamphlet "Common Sense" fortified the resilience of the colonial troops and populace. Paine, a former corset-maker, Quaker and privateer from Britain, revolutionized the political thinking of his time with his passionate invective. After the American Revolution, Paine played radical thinker to Edmund Burke’s intellectual conservative in a clash over the implications of the French Revolution. Paine’s book-length defense of the Revolution, “The Rights of Man,” was condemned as libelous in Britain and provided intellectual succor to the anti-monarchists in France. He became extremely unpopular and took refuge in Paris, where he was warmly welcomed, particularly by the Girondists. He even founded a newspaper with Condorcet. Granted honorary French citizenship, he was elected to the Convention, where he sat attentively despite his inability to speak French. He argued openly against the execution of Louis XVI, suggesting that he be exiled to the United States instead. Robespierre later had him arrested and thrown into prison. Paine narrowly escaped the guillotine and eventually returned to the United States. *

Id: [0x00085A06]
The greatest chemist of the 18th century, author of what would become known as Lavoisier's Law — "nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed." Lavoisier also made significant contributions to the science of combustion, including the identification of oxygen and hydrogen, and his pioneering work on the list of elements. No one would better explain the world until Einstein. In terms of the Revolution, Lavoisier was a supporter of new philosophical ideas and a new social order (he called for the creation of social insurance and retirement funds for the elderly, the abolition of all forced work for peasants, as well as freedom of trade). Both before and during the revolution, he served on the Gunpowder Commission which greatly improved the quality of French munitions. However, as a former member of the Ferme Générale (a private tax-collecting system under the monarchy), Lavoisier fell afoul of the radical revolutionaries and was declared a traitor by the Convention. In 1794, upon his arrest, Lavoisier, who had been conducting an experiment in his laboratory at the Royal Arsenal, requested a few days more to continue his work. The judge refused: "The Republic needs neither scientists nor chemists," before sending him to guillotine. Lavoisier’s wife Marie-Anne worked alongside her husband in the laboratory as translator and assistant. She is largely responsible for securing his legacy as a scientist after the Revolution.

This little duke of Normandy became dauphin upon the death of his elder brother on June 4, 1789, in the midst of the crisis at the Estates General. A scrawny child, he grew badly, and suffered from tuberculosis from which he would eventually die. His three years in prison at the Temple would worsen his state of health, but were not the direct cause of his death. No more than the abuse seemingly inflicted upon him by his keeper, the cobbler Antoine Simon. Simon was a brute, but not a conscious torturer. He insisted on teaching Louis well-known dirty songs. Recognized by the émigrés as Louis XVII in 1793, he died alone in the darkness of his cell on June 8, 1795. His death led to all sorts of outrageous theories: some claimed the child had escaped from the Temple. In subsequent years, a number of phony dauphins would come forth to claim the title.

One of the worst poets of his generation, which produced many. The young Fabre won the "lys d'argent" (silver lily) second prize in a poetry competition, but took the name "églantine" from the name of the first prize — "églantine d'or" (golden wild rose) which he claimed to have received. And so this traveling troubadour became known as Fabre d'Eglantine. Described as a "lazy, unstable, handsome hunk" by French historian Jean Tulard, it was only thanks to the Revolution that he went down in history. He was saved from prison — for debt — by a letter of remission from Louis XVI. As a token of his gratitude, he joined the riots and became involved in shady dealings with Danton and Marat, while writing popular plays. To support his lavish lifestyle, he offered his services to the court: three million to create a monarchist movement within the Jacobin camp. Danton, Minister of Justice, hired him as secretary. Robespierre blamed him for fiddling with army supplies: he made a huge profit on an advance order of thousands of pairs of boots for the army's soldiers … which were never delivered. Along the way, the poet played the role of villain in the September Massacres and came up with the names of the months for the revolutionary calendar. As a result of his involvement in the fraudulent affairs of the French East India Company, Robespierre targeted him as a means to eventually get to Danton. Guillotined on April 6, 1794. Robespierre "the Incorruptible" described him thus: "Talented, but with no soul. Skilled in the art of depicting men, even more skillful in deceiving them." All that remains of his life's work is the well-known song "Il pleut, il pleut, bergère" (It rains, it rains, shepherdess).

Known as the "Ribaude du Palais-Royal" (the Trollop of the Palais-Royal), she set up two theaters that played to full houses. Her financial success inevitably aroused envy, and she was later accused of espionage and receiving funds from the English. Imprisoned on November 14, 1793, she was declared innocent and released after serving ten months. Following the death of Robespierre, who hated this kind of woman, she resumed her career and conquered the hearts of her many admirers once more. She was 90 when the final curtain fell.

At one point, Rotondo was accused of attempting to assassinate Lafayette, with whom he had an on-going feud. A regular at almost every political club, Rotondo was in close contact with the radical leaders of the day. He was in and out of prison for a variety of offenses.

Jean-Henri Masers de Latude was thrown into prison by Louis XV's mistress, Madame de Pompadour, albeit for good reason. Indeed, acting out of greed and ambition, he had invented a false conspiracy against her. He secretly sent her a vial of poison, followed by a letter warning her about the poison. Imprisoned in Vincennes, he escaped, was captured and locked up in the Bastille, he escaped again, using a make-shift rope ladder. Again captured, and again sentenced to Vincennes he escaped one last time. In 1787, he published his memoirs in which he recounted his various escapes from prison, including that of 1755 when he broke out of La Bastille through the chimney using the afore-mentioned rope ladder. When the Bastille was taken, he recovered the ladder and offered it — with great pomp — to the Hôtel de Ville. During the Revolution, he seized every opportunity to present himself as a tormented victim of tyranny. The storied rope-ladder can be found today in the Carnavalet Museum in Paris.

Considered "clever but harsh", this staunchly conservative Intendant of Finances would be one of the first victims of a populace venting fury over lack of food and high taxes. Just before the fall of the Bastille, he had the misfortune of replacing Jacques Necker, who was lauded as the savior of France by the starving masses who knew only that under Necker, taxes were lower. In the popular imagination, Foullon, along with his son-in-law, Bertier de Sauvigny, bore some responsibility for the food-shortages that plagued the nation throughout the period. By legend he had said during an early famine, “If they’re so hungry, they can graze on hay.” Foullon met an unpleasant end. Taken from his refuge in the countryside, he was marched barefoot to Paris, whipped with nettles, made to carry a bundle of hay and given only peppered vinegar to drink. After several attempted hangings, he was beheaded and his head paraded in the streets on the end of a pike.

He earned immense popular among Parisians for his early support of a vote by headcount at the Estates-General. In addition, he was a philanthropist who petitioned for the same death sentence for all, regardless of social class. Along with Dr. Antoine Louis, he sought to improve a machine first devised by harpsichord maker Tobias Schmitt which would lop the victim’s head off painlessly. No more swords, no more breaking wheels, no more gallows. Quick death guaranteed, even at the hands of clumsy executioners. He fell afoul of the Committee of Public Safety late in the Revolution and spent a month in prison, but escaped a final reunion with his invention.

Of note is his marriage to Désirée Clary, a former sweetheart of Napoleon Bonaparte, whom Bernadotte served under at the thunderous success at Austerlitz.

What sort of negotiation ensued is lost to history, but somehow Désirée's older sister married Joseph and Désirée herself became engaged to Napoleon. The marriage was not to come to fruition: Napoleon became infatuated with the extraordinary Josephine Beauharnais, and Désirée met and later married the dashing officer, Jean Bernadotte. A few years later, her husband, via an unusal adoptive relationship was more-or-less "appointed" to be king of Sweden and Désirée became queen. *

It was there that, to her great surprise, she discovered psychic abilities that would allow her to pursue the practice of devination. With the Revolution, she moved to Paris and set up a fortune-telling enterprise. It is said that this is where she met three key figures of the Revolution, namely Marat, Robespierre and Saint-Just, for all of whom she predicted a violent death. *

She was also employed by Louis XVI to teach drawing and modeling to Louis' sister, and moved into Versailles. However, such proximity to royalty served her poorly after the fall of the monarchy. She was arrested for royalist sympathies and waited to meet her death in the same cell as Eugène de Beauharnais. Just as the executioner was cutting her hair to clear her neck, the order came for her release. The condition of her freedom was to create wax sculptures of famous heads, whether hated or celebrated. Eventually, these would include Marie-Antoinette, Marat and Robespierre. Her mentor Curtius died in the autumn of 1794 just as the Terror was subsiding. He left Marie his collection of heads. ***

The figure of Marianne is the allegorical figure of revolutionary France. Wearing a Phrygian cap, she embodies the "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" maxim adopted by the French Republic. The two forenames Marie and Anne were among the most popular in rural France, and particularly amongst servants working in the cities. The figure of Marianne was first used to represent France in October 1792 with a revolutionary song entitled “the Healing of Marianne.” The refrain sings praises of the new republican regime officially installed 10 days earlier. The forename would soon be associated with the French motherland, symbol of the republic triumphing over its enemies, both from outside and within. One of the most significant representations of Marianne can be seen in Eugène Delacroix's famous painting, Liberty guiding the people, completed in 1830.

In his youth, Flamel had a strange dream in which an angel showed him an extraordinary book. It was in this "Book of Abraham Eleazar" that he would later discover the secrets of alchemy. Flamel went on a pilgrimage to Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle, where he met a certain Maestro Canches, a Jewish Kabbalist who would give him certain keys for interpreting the book, which, it is told, allowed Flamel to use alchemical methods to acquire his fortune. Flamel is credited with the reconstruction of the church of Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie, the remains of which now stand as the Saint-Jacques Tower. Though some say that the philosopher's stone made Flamel immortal, it is known that he died on March 22, 1418. He is buried alongside his wife in the present-day Cluny Museum in Paris.

Nostradamus

Id: [0x00085A61]
Michel de Nostredame was born on December 14, 1503 in Saint-Remy-de-Provence in the south of France. An apothecary, he drafted his first Almanac in 1550, in which he predicted events to come in relatively obscure, rhyming couplets. It was around this time that he began to go by the name of Nostradamus, actually an inaccurate Latin translation of Nostre-Dame. He went on to publish The Prophecies, a work that would effectively ensure his fame and reputation. He was summoned to the court by Catherine de Médicis in 1555. It seems that he predicted the death of Henri II, King of France, correctly foretelling that Henri’s skull would be pierced in a duel with his master-at-arms in 1559. In 1564, Charles IX assigned him the role of Physician-in-Ordinary to the king. He died on July 2, 1566 in Salon-de-Provence. *

<LF>ranscripts of the trials of the Knights Templar seem to indicate that Baphomet may have been worshipped among them, although that is inconclusive. It’s possible that the Knights Templar brought these beliefs back with them from their journeys during the Crusades.

Estates General Deputees

In March 1789, elections were held to select the 578 deputies of the three Estates. The list of deputies included such men as Robespierre, Mounier, Barnave, Sieyès, and the comte de Mirabeau who, although a noble, chose to sit as a deputy of the Third Estate. Most of the men who comprised the Third Estate were in their late twenties or early thirties. The plain black clothes worn by the deputies of the Third Estate contrasted sharply with the luxurious, brightly-colored garments of the nobles and the clergy. *

If the First Estate was the church and the Second Estate was the nobility, the Third Estate was "everyone else."

The Society of the Friends of the Constitution (or Jacobin Club, deriving its name from the convent where its members gathered) was one of the most powerful political clubs in France for much of the Revolution. With over 7,000 chapters at its height, its membership was estimated at nearly half a million. The club was initially a gathering place for Breton deputies, but quickly expanded to allow anyone, even civilians and foreign nationals, to join. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Sounds pretty exclusive.<LF>--<LF><LF>Despite its later reputation for extremism, the Jacobin Club supported, at least nominally, the monarchy right up to the eve of the Republic. The club became radicalized in June of 1791, when many of its more moderate deputies left to form a new club, the Feuillants. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** The first thing I look for in any club is the ability to pronounce it. <LF>Feuillants = Fail. <LF>Or should that be Fueil.<LF>--<LF><LF>After the fall of the monarchy, Robespierre rose to prominence within the club, and with his backing, and that of the Parisian mob, the Jacobins effectively seized control of the government. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* They so often make such convincing arguments, the mob, I find.<LF>--<LF><LF>The Jacobins instituted a Reign of Terror, repeatedly purging the National Convention and the population at large of anyone deemed an enemy of the Republic. The Jacobins held sway for nearly a year before Robespierre overplayed his hand and was himself arrested and executed for treason. Deprived of its leadership, the Jacobin Club was closed and outlawed in November 1794.

The term "sans-culottes" (literally, those without culottes, or breeches) initially referred to the common men who committed acts of violence in the name of the Revolution.

<LF>-<LF><LF>These Swiss regiments were highly sought after in Europe since the Swiss cantons were reputed to produce good, obedient and ferocious soldiers. By the end of the 15th century, the Swiss Hundred Guard ("Cent Suisses") was created and regularly stationed in Paris. By the middle of the 18th century, the protection of the Champs-Élysées was entrusted to a detachment of ten or so soldiers tasked with maintaining order and arresting lawbreakers. During the Revolution, members of the Swiss Guard would protect Louis XVI at the Château des Tuileries, but were overwhelmed and massacred on August 10, 1792, once the Sovereign and his family had taken refuge in the salle du Manège where the National Convention was held, and where the Monarch would later be judged. **

Non-Juring Priests

Id: [0x00085A79]
On July 12, 1790, the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was instituted. This legislation determined that God's representatives would no longer answer to the Pope in Rome, but instead to France and its Revolutionary Government. They would be paid and overseen by the state. As a result, the Church became part of French administration, which sought to ensure the loyalty of its representatives to the values of the Revolution. Those who accepted this new order had to take a solemn oath "to the nation, the law and the king." Many priests did not view these changes favorably, and refused to take the oath. Pope Pius VI sent his condemnation of the act the next day. Those who refused the oath were labeled "non-juring" or "refractory" priests. Many who refused were physically attacked for their piety to Rome.

Thomas de Carneillon

Id: [0x00085A81]
Born in 1276 in the Republic of Metz, Thomas de Carneillon was a wealthy banker and economic rival of the Knights Templar. He contributed a sizable force, probably of Flemish mercenaries, to Philip IV’s arrest and imprisonment of the Templars on October 13, 1307. With his chief rival out of the way, Thomas and his cabal of supporters—including such luminaries as Dante Alighieri, Marco Polo, and Domenico Auditore—spread their influence across Europe, toppling monarchs and bishops alike as they saw fit. He died of an illness in Venice, sometime around the spring of 1323.*

-<LF><LF>* Oh dear. Real history time: Thomas de Carneillon was Mentor of the French Brotherhood in the late 13th through early 14th centuries. He was one of the key participants in the downfall of the original Templar Order, back when they conveniently wore enormous red targets on their chests. Those “Flemish mercenaries” were us, by the way, but I’m guessing you already saw that when you “experienced Helix” or whatever focus-group-tested audience-approved marketing speak they’re using these days.

Afte<LF> Jacques de Molay and his cronies were rounded up, Thomas and his Assassin brothers and sisters spent a decade crisscrossing Europe. <LF><LF>On a sidenote, I spent a month crisscrossing Europe after university and I’ll tell you what: it bloody felt like a decade.

 <LF>rno drops out of the historical record until the mid-1780s, when his name comes up in several dispatches from the Marshallcy in and around Versailles. Fragmented records identify him as a prisoner in the Bastille in 1789, but he was not among the prisoners liberated when the fortress was stormed. The only other direct references to an “Arno Dorian” are in the journals of Napoleon, in entries dated August 1792, October 1795, and May 1808.**

“Roi des Thunes” (roughly “King of Beggars”) is a title claimed by various influential figures among the indigent population of Paris.

Captain Frédéric Rouille joined the Gardes Françaises in 1789, just in time to witness the beginning of the Revolution. As the son of a poor cobbler, Rouille had no hope of advancement into the aristocratic officer corps of the Gardes, and by the accounts of his contemporaries (Rouille himself left no letters or journals behind and may have been illiterate), the rhetoric of the Revolution found a true believer in him. When the bulk of the Gardes Françaises defected to the Garde nationale, Rouille was among them. He rose quickly through the ranks, unhindered by his lack of aristocratic breeding, and along with Santerre was one of the key figures in the storming of the Tuileries palace.*

Marie was, by all accounts, a fierce intellect and a sharp wit, and within a few years she had rebuilt the Levesque fortune.

Referred to by a number of euphemisms during the Revolution: the "little window," the "national razor," and a "cat's hole." The mechanism is made of simple elements: a sharp, heavy, angled blade, grooved struts to guide the blade, a lunette (two-piece wood frame for the head), and a release mechanism. The revolutionaries considered the guillotine as an advance for humanity. At the time, public executions could go horribly wrong. If the executioner did not manage to sever the victim's neck with a single swing of the sword, he could face legal proceedings for inflicting suffering that was not otherwise stated in the execution sentence. The guillotine was seen as a more humane, equal form of execution valid for all citizens. Dr. Guillotin asserted that victims would only feel a slight breath of air on their neck. <LF><LF>A persistent legend surrounds the design of the guillotine according to which Dr. Joseph Ignace Guillotin reputedly asked for the King's advice concerning the creation of his famous machine, at which point the king suggested an angled blade.

Estates General of 1789

Id: [0x00085AE8]
The Estates-General was a general assembly representing the three classes or "estates" of French society: the clergy (the First Estate), the nobility (the Second Estate), and the peasantry (the Third Estate). The Estates-General was not a legislative body like the English Parliament; rather, its role was to advise the King, with whom all authority lay.*<LF><LF>--<LF>* I have often imagined what it might be like to be a King. <LF>I think my first rule would be to make all crime illegal. <LF>Boom. Just like that. You’re welcome.
<LF>-<LF><LF>It was infrequently called: before the onset of the Revolution, the last meeting of the Estates-General was in 1614. The Estates-General sat for several weeks in May and June 1789 to address the financial crisis facing the realm, thanks in no small part to the French government's role in financing the American Revolution. The meeting quickly came to an impasse over the first item on the agenda, however: whether the Estates-General should vote collectively by estate (which would give an advantage to the first and second estates), or vote individually (which would give the more-numerous Third Estate the advantage). Deadlocked, the deputies of the Third Estate began to discuss political reforms rather than the financial crisis that had been the original agenda. The meeting of the Estates General dissolved when the Third Estate declared itself the National Assembly and announced that it would conduct the nation's affairs. The First and Second Estates were invited to join the Assembly, but it was clear which way the political wind was blowing. The French Revolution was beginning.

<LF>-<LF><LF>When word reached the city that Louis XVI had dismissed his finance minister, it was taken as a sign of an impending coup attempt by conservative factions within the government. Seeking to arm themselves against this coup, a procession of radicals gathered and headed for the Left Bank, where they seized some 40,000 muskets from the armory at the Hotel des Invalides. However, there was no powder or shot to be had, and so the revolutionaries made for the Bastille. At the time, there were over 30,000 pounds of powder and shot stored within the prison. The governor, Bernard-René de Launay, had less than a hundred men, mainly veteran soldiers and Swiss guards, to hold the prison against perhaps a thousand insurgents. De Launay refused to surrender, and his forces were quickly overwhelmed, the powder was seized, and the prisoners (all seven remaining in the Bastille) were freed. When told of the attack by the Duke of La Rouchefoucald, Louis XVI was reported to ask: "Is it a revolt?" The Duke replied: "No, sire, it is a revolution."

On August 6, 1792, a crowd gathered on the Champ-de-Mars once more to petition the king's deposition. An atmosphere of besiegement reigned in Paris, but it was not against foreign enemies that the insurgents sought to defend themselves, but those from within; those who were in a position to derail the Revolution. Jacobins and Cordeliers took refuge in the Paris City Hall along with 7,000 soldiers. The King strengthened his positions at the Tuileries Palace from 2,000 to 3,000 men, mainly Swiss Guards. On the night of August 10, with the monarchy just hours from its impending doom, the tocsin sounded to mark the beginning of the revolt. The insurgents wanted to ensure that the King would be unable to regain his rights. The fighting was swift and brutal: the Swiss Guard were massacred almost to a man. The King, meanwhile, took advantage of the confusion to slip away from the palace and place himself in the hands of the National Convention. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Funny how the noble are so rarely the first to act nobly. <LF>--<LF><LF>Ultimately, the assault led to the demise of the Legislative Assembly, the formal abolition of the monarchy, and the creation of the National Convention. It would also lead, less directly, to the September Massacres a month later.

September Massacres

Id: [0x00085AEE]
The military situation in 1792 was deteriorating. Although the Duke of Brunswick, commander-in-chief of the German army, had made his way through Lorraine onto French soil, it was the defeat at Verdun on September 2, 1792 that scared the French deputies. With this Sword of Damocles hanging over the head of Paris, a great many Revolutionaries called for a radical purge of all opposition. Among them was Marat, who exclaimed: "Rise up! Rise up! Let the blood of the traitors flow!" In a similar vein, Danton memorably affirmed, against the Duke of Brunswick and the invaders, "We need audacity, and yet more audacity, and always audacity, and France shall be saved!" *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Quite an audacious thing to say. He’s setting a good example.
<LF>-<LF><LF>At this time, the prisons were filled with thousands of men and women, some hostile to the Revolution such as non-juring priests and former aristocrats, but also common law criminals and lunatics. Fearing that the prisons were a veritable nest of traitors waiting to strike at Paris from within even as Brunswick invaded from without, the revolutionaries made for the prisons and began murdering anyone even remotely suspected of counter-revolutionary sentiment.<LF><LF>Between 1,090 and 1,395 prisoners were killed before the massacres finally ceased. These outbursts of punitive violence had left their mark on the Parisians, although a number of deputies insisted that these actions had been necessary. In the provinces, they engendered disapproval and horror with regard to Paris, but they also spread terror among potential opponents.

Montgolfier Flight

Id: [0x00085AF0]
Science was a subject of speculation and intense debate at the end of the 18th century. The public were invited to various experiments to attest to scientific advances. Balloons were a firm favorite of the masses in the 1780s and in particular on July 11, 1784. The Montgolfier brothers were among the first men to launch manned ascents in hot air balloons. Brothers Joseph and Étienne conducted an experiment in Paris under the patronage of the French Academy of Sciences. On September 9, 1783, a balloon was flown with the first living beings: a sheep, a duck and a rooster. *
<LF>--<LF>* Sounds like the beginning of a great joke.<LF>“A sheep, a duck and a rooster all get in a big balloon and float away.”
“<LF>aha. What happened next?”
<LF>I don’t know. They were literally never seen again.”
-<LF><LF><LF>That same year in Paris, Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes would be the first humans to lift off in a balloon. The crowd of curious onlookers gathered to witness the scene.

Food Shortages & Riots

Id: [0x00085AF2]
The shortage of bread was one of the driving factors behind the French Revolution. Droughts in the summer of 1788 caused the price of grain to skyrocket. In 1789 the price of one loaf of bread was more than half a day’s pay for the common workers – and that’s when there was bread to be had. One of the objectives of the Women’s March in October 1789 was to demand bread from the King himself. *

--<LF>* What did they expect him to do? Buy a breadmaker? Whip up a wrap?<LF>--<LF><LF>Even after the revolution, food continued to be scarce. Trouble with crops, combined with a need to provide the army with bread led to a shortage across France. Merchants were accused of price fixing and food hoarding**, leading to riots in the marketplace.  The newly-formed government tried to fix the problem by setting bread prices, but given that they fixed the price well below the cost of grain, this only fueled the problems it attempted to solve. <LF><LF>--<LF><LF>** … because the Templars were hoarding food and fixing prices. To cause riots. 
<LF>o that worked out well for them, didn’t it?

Trial of Louis XVI

Id: [0x00085AF4]
The trial of Louis Capet (as the deposed Louis XVI was called) began on December 11, 1792. He faced 11 charges, including having tried to prevent the meeting of the Estates-General and, in so doing, of having made an attempt upon liberty; having ordered the storage of grain, sugar and coffee; having made an agreement with Leopold II and the King of Prussia to restore the French monarchy; and having suspended the execution of a decree against the refractory priests. Louis retaliated to each of the charges and sought to give weight to his arguments. Even if he knew that his fate was sealed and that there was little he could do to prevent it, he was not resigned to it. <LF><LF>On January 15, the National Convention declared Louis Capet guilty of conspiracy against public freedom. 691 deputies voted "yea" in favor of a verdict of guilty; not a single deputy voted "nay". Sentencing would proceed over the following two days, with the main point of debate being whether Louis should be imprisoned, exiled, or put to death--and if it were to be execution, should the sentence be carried out immediately, or held in abayance until a more politically opportune time. In the end, immediate execution carried the day with 361 votes: the exact number needed for a majority. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* It’s almost like it was planned that way.

Assassination of Louis-Michel Le Peletier

A noble by birth, Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau was an ardent defender of the people's cause and symbolically relinquished his titles of nobility. In June 1790, he became president of the National Assembly. On January 20, 1793, he cast the deciding vote for the death of Louis XVI, but only after a great deal of hesitation. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Well, I should think so!<LF>--<LF><LF> On the very evening of the vote, Le Peletier was killed under mysterious circumstances at a café in the Palais Royal.

Execution of Louis XVI

Id: [0x00085AF9]
January 21, 1793 was a cold day in Paris. The dreary winter of 1792-93 brought a morose, dark and icy atmosphere upon the French capital. On the morning of his execution, locked in his cell at the Temple, Louis prayed for the salvation of his soul and prepared to meet his creator.<LF><LF>At the foot of the scaffold, his hands were bound. He proceeded to climb the steps. Once atop the scaffold next to the guillotine, he stood up straight as he had at his trial and decided to speak to the crowd: "I die innocent of all the crimes laid to my charge. I pardon those who have occasioned my death, and I pray to God that the blood you are going to shed may never fall on France." An order was given to roll the drums to drown out his voice. <LF><LF>Louis was nudged forward to the guillotine plank, whereupon his voice failed and his words were lost. It was 10:24 am. In the space of a few seconds, Louis' head was placed in the headstock, then the executioner pulled the release mechanism and the blade fell down and severed his head, which toppled into a wicker basket. The executioner grasped it by the hair and held it up for the people to see. Cries of "Vive la Nation!" and "Vive la République!" were heard. The crowd then chorused the emblematic revolutionary song "Ça ira" (literally, "it'll be fine"). *
<LF>--<LF>* Hardly the most rousing or confident sentiment to come out with after chopping off a King’s head. “It’ll be fine! Honestly, it’ll be fine!”. I’d be looking for a little more certainty in my songs.

Fate of Versailles

After the abolition of the aristocracy and Louis XVI's deposition, the royal city of Versailles suffered a drastic drop in population: from roughly 60,000 souls in 1789, the city's population plummeted to fewer than 30,000 in just four years. Looters, attracted by the abandoned royal palace and the many noble estates, added an element of lawlessness that wouldn't be driven out until the early 19th century, when King Louis-Philippe declared the Palais de Versailles a National Museum dedicated to "all the glories of France."

Austria was one of France’s northern neighbors. *
<LF>-<LF>* Well – apart from the countries in between, of course. I’ve seen Abstergo mess with history plenty of times. But geography is a new one. (Austria did control what was to become Belgium at the time, so perhaps that’s what was meant, but come now, people, clarity!)
--<LF>And their history leading up to the revolution was notoriously rocky.<LF>Even the King’s marriage to an Austrian woman didn’t smooth relations between the countries – Marie Antoinette was regarded with suspicion, and gossip accused her of having too great an influence on the King’s decisions.

In<LF>1792, the Legislative Assembly decided that war was a good way to export its problems** and declared war on Austria. The war progressed slowly until a mob attacked the Tuileries palace in Paris, and the Austrians began to invade France. They easily took Verdun – a short march from Paris – causing panic in the city, and probably leading to the September Massacres.

<LF>-<LF>**Only they called it “spreading the revolution”. A wonderful political spin.

Execution of Georges Danton

Id: [0x00085B11]
In 1793, three men aspired to lead France: Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Danton's reputation preceded him. He was partial to money, women and good living. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Oh. What an oddball.<LF>--<LF><LF> It was said that he would readily change sides if there were a profit in it for him. Like many others, he was known to be corrupt; it seemed they all were, with the exception of Robespierre, known as the "incorruptible".<LF><LF> Danton, however, was not sufficiently guarded: "They wouldn't dare!" he said. Set on putting principles before men, Robespierre knew this and would indeed dare. <LF><LF>On April 5, Desmoulins and Danton were led to the Place de la Révolution (the present-day Place de la Concorde). Robespierre thus sent his friend to the guillotine. He closed the shutters in his room to avoid seeing or hearing anything. However, the convoy that carried the members of the Indulgent party to the scaffold passed in front of Robespierre's house. Danton recognized the building. Refusing to sit, he shouted out: "Robespierre, you will follow us shortly! Your house shall be beaten down and sowed with salt!" 
<LF>Just before his execution, Danton turned to Sanson, his executioner, and said: "Show my head to the people. It is worth seeing." **<LF><LF>--<LF>** It’s nice to have confidence in your appearance, but that’s taking it a bit far.

The Women's March was one of the inciting events of the French Revolution, and effectively brought the king under the power of the state.*<LF><LF>--<LF>*Which I should note is exactly what Mirabeau wanted, and part of the reason the assassins were there in the first place.<LF>--<LF><LF>On October 5, 1789, tired of wanting for food, and especially bread, more than 700 women from Les Halles, the biggest market in Paris, decided to act. They converged at the Paris City Hall, which they subsequently ransacked, taking 1700 muskets and 4 cannons. Workers from the Saint-Marceau and Saint-Antoine districts would come and join them. The crowd then made for Versailles. <LF><LF>When the crowd reached the marble courtyard of the château of Versailles, the King appeared. The crowd drew silent, respectful of their monarch. Then the Queen emerged. The angry mob  hurled abuse at her before they began to shout: "To Paris!".  The King and Queen, along with their children, were forced to return to the capital, where they stayed at the Tuileries palace.

Death of Mirabeau

Id: [0x00085B15]
On April 2, 1791, Honoré-Gabriel Riqueti Mirabeau lay on his death bed. The 42 year-old was exhausted from his excessive drinking and womanizing.*
<LF>--<LF>* Has anyone ever been so exhausted from womanising that they have to go straight to their death bed? I mean – that’s actually quite impressive. I think I’d probably have been standing at the end of his bed as he went, applauding.
--<LF><LF>Mirabeau had been a double agent since the Estates General of 1789. He had received money from Louis XVI in return for his advisory services, and to make sure that the Revolution would never overthrow the monarchy. <LF><LF>An impassioned speaker who was always willing to stand up to his enemies, his death caused a considerable amount of dismay in Paris; he was seen as a potential minister as well as a first-rate thinker. His ashes were later transferred to the Panthéon. And yet, in 1792, when an iron chest was discovered at the Tuileries Palace containing correspondence between Louis XVI and, among others, Mirabeau, the latter was immediately discredited and removed from the Pantheon.

Mirabeau's death prompted a desire to honor the great men who forged the Revolution. On April 4, 1791, the Sainte-Geneviève church was transformed into the "Pantheon of great men" with the following inscription on the building's pediment: "To its great men, a grateful nation." 
<LF>And yet, in 1792, when an iron chest was discovered at the Tuileries Palace containing correspondence between Louis XVI and, among others, Mirabeau, the latter was immediately discredited and removed from the Pantheon.*<LF><LF>--<LF>* Probably just jealous of his womanising, I’d imagine.

Auto-da-fé

An auto-da-fé (from the Portuguese for 'act of faith'') was originally a ritual of the Inquisition wherein the accused made proof of their good faith. However, since the ritual generally ended with the accused being burnt at the stake, in the popular mind auto-da-fé came to mean the burning itself. The term came to France during the Revolution and was turned inside-out, now meaning a Revolutionary act of faith - against Christian clerics.

Conciergerie

This palace was the seat of the Kings of France from the 10th century to the middle of the 14th, when Charles V abandoned it for the Louvre. By the early 15th century, it was primarily used as a prison, though the name "Conciergerie" (from "concierge," keeper of the royal palace) stuck.<LF><LF>By the time of the Revolution, the Conciergerie was the main prison in Paris. For many, it was the last stop before execution, which earned it the nickname "antechamber of the guillotine." The Conciergerie was also called "the most lucrative furnished lodging in Paris." Prisoners were allowed to rent a bed for 27 livres a month, but since many were executed after only a few days, jailors could rent out the same bed sometimes ten times a month.

Sainte-Chapelle

The Sainte-Chapelle, or Holy Chapel, was built by Louis IX (later canonized as Saint Louis), to house Christ's crown of thorns, which he had just purchased from Baldwin II of Constantinople. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Louis purchased the crown of thorns, that means. Christ didn’t travel into the future to buy a crown of thorns from Baldwin II of Constantinople. He had ready access to thorns in biblical times - he didn’t need to go all the way to Constantinople to find some bloke called Baldwin II.

<LF>lso - Baldwin II? So Baldwin the first suffered through life with that godawful name then decided to give it to his son, as well? <LF><LF>Some people.<LF>--<LF><LF> The edifice is a unique example of seemingly invisible stonework since its windows take up all the space between the structural supports. Perhaps more extraordinary is that it was built in just two years, between 1246 and 1248. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** Believe me, I’m very familiar with European builders. Nothing else in their history has ever been built in just two years. Not even a small wall or miniature water feature.
<LF>-<LF><LF> It is set on two levels: the lower level was for Parisians and the people of the court; the upper level was for the king and his family.<LF><LF>On important occasions, the king presented the Crown, taken from the reliquary to which he alone had the key, to the kneeling congregation. It came close to being demolished during the Revolution, but would eventually be used as a flour store, a club room for the Section de la Cité, and finally a store for archiving old papers, which effectively saved it, since it served the people.

Louvre

The Louvre could be referred to in the plural, since there have in fact been several Louvre palaces since Philippe-Auguste inaugurated it as a fortress. Each new regime sought to leave its own particular mark on the edifice, starting with Charles V “the Wise.” *

<LF>-<LF>* “The Wise”. I think that’s the nickname I’d go for. Better than that guy called “The Fat” or the other one who wanted to be known as “The Severe”. Two of the worst nicknames in history.
--

Fra<LF>ce's monarchs never ceased to embellish and improve the ""Leovar"" which, in Old Saxon, means fortified camp, and which would become "Louvre".  And so this barbarian gourbi (or shack) became the largest palace in the world.  Expanded and improved by<LF>Francis I (who had several sobriquets including “Francis of the Large Nose”)** as well as by Henry II, and later Louis XIV.

<LF>-<LF>** Okay. “Of the Large Nose”. We have a new worst nickname. “Hi, they call me King of the Large Nose.” Well, be still, my beating heart!

Palais des Tuileries

Id: [0x00085B29]
Originally a separate palace, the Tuileries was united with the Louvre palace by Henry IV. The original Tuileries was the result of a caprice of Catherine de' Medici, who found the Louvre too big, too cold, and too crowded. She turned her attentions to a former tile factory on the other side of the ditch, which she would transform into the palace of her dreams. Since the land was vacant, there was no one to expropriate.*<LF><LF>--<LF>* Posh person’s word, meaning: forcibly turf out.
<LF>-<LF><LF>Over the centuries, the Tuileries' garden would become much like an amusement park, the highlight of which came when Jacques Alexandre César Charles launched the world's first hydrogen filled balloon there: 400,000 people filled the garden, embankments, roofs and Place Louis XV: the entry fee was three sous. Nine years later, the mood was decidedly less friendly to Louis XVI when he and his family had to take refuge in the Salle du Manège, having escaped a mob of insurgents who invaded the Tuileries on August 10, 1792: a revolutionary day that brought the monarchy's downfall.

The Bastille

Id: [0x00085B2B]
The Bastille was one of the many construction projects undertaken by Charles V, and was intended to protect the Porte Saint-Antoine gate and its adjoining Saint-Pol palace. As the centuries wore on and the fortress became less useful as a fortification, it was used more and more often as a prison, finally being completely dedicated to that purpose under the reign of Louis XIII. The prisoners held there, who rarely numbered more than 40 each year, were most commonly political prisoners.<LF><LF>By 1789, the Bastille was deemed useless, and was costly to maintain, with 250 soldiers for a mere nine prisoners. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* I had an idea for how to bring the costs down. Fire 247 soldiers. Their system is like having a plane with one seat but hundreds of captains.<LF>Hang on – that sounds brilliant.
<LF>-<LF><LF>This was at a time when Paris was packed with prisons of all shapes and sizes. Nonetheless, it was seen as a symbol of the oppression of the Ancien Regime, and when the French Revolution broke out, it was one of the first buildings to be looted and destroyed. The Revolutionaries' quarry became quite literally that, as the mob demolished the building and put its stones to better use. Some of the stones were used to consolidate the Pont de la Concorde, others were taken as individual or collective relics, many were carved into tiny models of the entire fortress and sold as souvenirs.

Hôtel de Sens

Located on the bank of the River Seine, the Hôtel de Sens, along with the Hôtel de Cluny, is the last vestige of medieval architecture in Paris (1475). The hotel was built for the Archbishop of Sens, a character who overshadowed even the Archbishop of Paris. It currently houses the Forney art library, thus conferring an altogether literary sheen on what is otherwise a military work of architecture. A cannon ball remains lodged in the walls near to the left turret as a sober reminder of the riots of 1830. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* On a lighter note, the insatiable Queen Margot saw her young lover's throat slit by a jealous suitor in front of its beautiful Gothic gate.

Temple

Id: [0x00085B2F]
After returning from their crusades to Jerusalem, the Knights Templar built this stronghold in 1240 to serve as the headquarters of the Order in Europe and the center of its charitable works. After King Philip IV betrayed the Order and executed Jacques de Molay, the Temple was used for a time by the Knights of Malta before being converted into a prison. Most of the French royal family were held within its walls, most notably Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the dauphin, Louis-Charles. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Now that would have made for a great reality TV show. Just add a public vote and some kind of eviction party in front of a jeering crowd. They could even yell “Cut!” as the guillotine fell. 
-<LF><LF><LF>By the early 1800s, the prison had become a place of pilgrimage for royalists, and Napoleon ordered it demolished to remove its use as a symbol of the old monarchy. Today, it survives only as a stop on the Paris Metro and a covered market in the third arrondissement, its name a silent memorial to a betrayer king and a king betrayed.

Hôtel de Cluny

Id: [0x00085B31]
An outstanding example of medieval household architecture in Paris. The Hôtel de Cluny was built at the center of the Gallo-Roman capital (vestiges of a Roman thermal bath still abut the hôtel). The Abbot of Cluny purchased the site to transform it into a town house in 1334, but it was Jacques d'Amboise who turned it into what was essentially a luxurious guest house in 1485. One of its occupants was Mary Tudor, the young widow of Louis XII. Francis I, fearing that she might give birth to a son who would take his place on the throne, kept her under surveillance here. Such caution was justified; he found her in the arms of the Duke of Suffolk, her military attaché. She was promptly married in the chapel then sent packing with her husband on the first boat to England. The building is now a charming museum renowned for its collection of tapestries.

At the end of the 12th century, King Philippe Auguste established different markets and fairs in a place called Les Champeaux, which later evolved in the Les Halles quarter.<LF>However, as the markets grew, the streets around became increasingly congested. Shipping grain through the traffic became complicated and slow. <LF><LF>In the 18th century, the city of Paris decided to simplify the grain transport and stocking by building a more easily accessible Halle aux Blés. The land was purchased in 1755 and a ring-shaped structure was built there. Initially roofless, in 1782 a wooden cupola was added to protect the grain from rain and other weather events*.
<LF>--<LF>* It is unbelievable it took that long. <LF>“Hey, let’s store all our grain in this big wide-open thing!”
“O<LF>i! But should we add a roof to protect our precious stock from the elements, contamination, wildlife and theft?”
<LF>Er – I think we’ll be fine, little Jimmy Nerdface… run along now…”

Cimetière des Saints-Innocents

Originally, the street leading to Saint-Denis — outside the ramparts of the Roman capital which mainly occupied the left bank — served as the city's cemetery. 

<LF>-<LF>* Just to say: you’re about to read my favourite historical nickname of all time.
<LF>-<LF><LF>Louis VI the Fat, who had already overseen the construction of Les Halles, had Saints-Innocents built in 1130. Its cemetery would become the cemetery of all the churches of Paris, which made for an unprecedented concentration of dead bodies: a plague epidemic could bring about thousands of deaths in the space of just a few weeks. In the 1400s improvements were made, partly paid for and designed by Nicolas Flamel. The whole was overseen by a macabre mural of the Dance of Death. Just prior to the Revolution, the bodies were disinterred and moved to the catacombs beneath Paris.

Grand Châtelet

Id: [0x00085B37]
Marked by an imposingly tall, square tower, this prison was once a fortress. Located in the heart of the city at the Place de Grève. It enjoyed a particularly sinister reputation. This was yet another construction by the indefatigable Louis VI the Fat, who wanted to defend the Grand Pont bridge (since replaced by the Pont au Change). Set in the middle of what was then a particularly squalid district, it served as the headquarters of the Prévôt de Paris, or provost marshal, who essentially ruled over the city, along with his lieutenants and his 48 advisers. Justice was dealt out swiftly within its walls. Whereas the Bastille was demolished in just a few frenzied weeks, the Grand Châtelet, was put to fresh use by the Reign of Terror, housing prisoners that would fall victim during the September Massacres. Finally, the prison itself fell to Napoleon, who wanted it razed. *

<LF>-<LF>* That’s the Small Man Complex for you. Constantly wanting to bring things down to their level.
<LF>-<LF><LF>Among its illustrious occupants were François Villon, Clément Marot, poisoner Antoine François Desrues, and the marquis de Favras in 1790 before being hanged. It engendered the word "morgue" in French (which, in the 15th century, meant "face" and, in its verbal form, "to stare at"). The Châtelet's jailers stared at their victims, no doubt with contempt, so that they would be able to identify them in case they escaped. The word "morgue" came to be used to designate the cells. **

In 1246, Louis IX invented the position of Provost of the Merchants, who centered his power in the Maison aux Piliers on this spot, eventually renamed the Hotel de Ville. The building came to have a row of busts along the front, celebrating the historical Mayors of Paris, who looked out over the Place de Gréve and its public executions. The interior was consumed in flames during the insurrection of 1871. The building was completely restored afterwards. It remains the center of Paris' municipal government to this day.

The second biggest church in Paris is situated at the center of Les Halles started out as a modest chapel dedicated to Sainte-Agnès, a Roman martyr. Later, relics of St. Eustache were brought to the church, and that saint (whose symbol is a large stag deer overseen by a cross) became the church’s namesake. With the development of the central market of Les Halles, the parish church became too small. The current church took 105 years to construct (1532–1637). Its gothic structure and renaissance detail, to say nothing of its dimensions, make it a surprising edifice. Moreover, it curves to the north since it was built along the line formed by the rue Traînée (Rambuteau), since no one wanted to expropriate the shopkeepers who were installed there. It is missing its southernmost tower.

Tour St. Jacques

Id: [0x00085B3D]
When the Church of Saint-Jacques-la-Boucherie was torn down, it was decided to preserve one of its flamboyant towers (built under the reign of Francis I), now known as the Tour de St. Jacques. There are no ornamental decorations around its base since it was formerly inside the nave, and therefore not visible. The original church was a starting point for the religious pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. The alchemist Nicolas Flamel was originally buried under the floor of the church. The remaining tower is also a monument to science since this is where the mathematician and inventor Blaise Pascal conducted experiments concerning atmospheric pressure in 1648.

Palais de Versailles

Id: [0x00085B3F]
Originally a hunting lodge built for Louis XIII, the Palace of Versailles was expanded into one of the largest palaces in the world, and the seat of the French monarchy, under the reign of his successor, Louis XIV. The royal family abandoned the palace for the Tuileries in Paris at the outset of the French Revolution. After the King's arrest, Versailles, along with all royal possessions, was confiscated and sealed. The furnishings were sold at auction in 1793, and in 1794 it was turned into a museum. *<LF><LF>-- <LF>* Odd. They got rid of everything in it, and then turned it into a museum. What were people supposed to look at? Small signs saying “A fancy chair used to be here”?

Village de Versailles

Id: [0x00085B41]
When Louis XIII built his first hunting lodge in the village of Versailles in 1623, it was surrounded by vast forests where the King could indulge in his favorite sport. It was his son, Louis XIV, who decided to make it the central point of France. In the 1660s, he decided to construct a château commensurate with his ambition to control the French State. In actual fact, he left Paris behind for fear of the revolts he had known as a child during the Fronde. In short, he no longer wanted to be subject to the fervor of Parisian crowds. Between 1665 and 1680, some 25,000 men and 6,000 horses busied themselves daily. One team worked days, the other nights by torchlight (the Church apparently tolerated work on Sundays). The French king wanted the magnificence of the palace to reveal his unequaled power to the rest of Europe, as capable of "forcing nature" as he was of imposing his law on the world. Versailles was a showcase. Nothing short of perfection would be tolerated. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* I find it hard enough to install decking. Mind you, I didn’t have 6,000 horses to help me. Not that they’re much good with hammers.
-<LF><LF><LF>The village of Versailles would also quickly develop, if only to accommodate all the courtiers: in 1682 they numbered 6,000; by 1690 their number had reached 10,000. To ensure their continued presence in Versailles, Louis XIV determined that all buildings erected in Versailles be non-liable to seizure for debt, which made the village particularly attractive. Louis XV and Louis XVI would both make a great many changes to the château, while transforming the village into a hub from which the royal administration exerted its power. It was in the Salle des Menus Plaisirs (literally, the room of lesser pleasures) — essentially a storeroom for royal decorations and disguises — that the Estates-General were held in May 1789.

Les Invalides

Id: [0x00085B43]
Both Henry IV and Cardinal Richelieu had previously attempted — in vain — to set up a hospital for invalid soldiers. Louis XIV, the "Sun King" solved the problem by taxing France's abbeys, and laid the first stone on November 30, 1671. Five years later, it was occupied by some 6,000 soldiers. In 1789, the Parisian mob stormed the hospital, seizing the cannon and muskets stored in its cellars for use in the storming of the Bastille. Some fifty years later, Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte would be entombed beneath the building's great, gilded dome.

<LF>lthough today Les Invalides is primarily a museum, it still serves as a retirement home and medical center for roughly 100 elderly or injured veterans. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* New veterans, of course. Not a hundred blokes from the 1780s who’ve somehow lived this long. That’d make it a hell of an effective hospital.

Palais Bourbon

The palace lay outside the former ramparts, but close to what was then the Place Louis XV (now place de la Concorde). At the time, it was a self-contained little city that provided a safe haven from the sprawling city. It was built on the whim of the illegitimate daughter (later legitimized) of Louis XIV and the Marquise de Montespan. Louis XV purchased the plot to brighten up the south side of the square that would bear his name until 1790. In the Revolutionary era, it was nationalized and the Council of the Five Hundred gathered there to deliberate and legislate.

École Militaire

Once the domain of partridges, rabbits and small game, it was in this former warren in Grenelle that Louis XV sought to build a military academy comparable with that founded by his great-grandfather, Louis XIV. The idea was to house and educate five hundred boys from poor, preferably war-stricken families, and to make elite officers of them. It was an undertaking primarily overseen and sponsored by the Marquise de Pompadour. As he wrote to her: "I have approved the project since you absolutely want it, my beloved." Eight years later, the first classes were held. One of the establishment's most famous pupils was the young Napolione Buonaparte, "Elève du Roi" (pupil of the king). Aged only 15, he graduated as a second lieutenant after a mere twelve months' study.

Sorbonne

The Sorbonne is so famous that its founder, the honorable Robert de Sorbon, chaplain of Louis IX and the first advocate of culture for all, is often overlooked. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Isn’t that disgraceful? It would be like someone walking around Hastings and not spending every waking moment thinking of me.
<LF>-<LF><LF>Having struggled to become a doctor of theology, he sought to facilitate the education of underprivileged children like himself. Saint-Louis offered him a house on rue Conpegeule along with a few of his own outbuildings, where Sorbon subsequently built his school. Three centuries later, Richelieu observed that the "Sorbonne" was falling into ruin, and set about renovating it. In 1629, he undertook to rebuild the entire establishment, provided a place was left for his tomb. This was duly done. The subsequent masterpiece built by Girardon was carefully protected during the Revolution, then, in 1816, re-established in the chapel of the Sorbonne once the return of Louis XVIII had been made official. Towards the end of the 19th century, the old Sorbonne of the Cardinal was rebuilt and extended. The Sorbonne has often been the subject of derision since Renaissance scholar Rabelais made reference to bugs called "sorbonagres" that devoured the intelligence of thinkers.

In 1744, King Louis XV vowed that if he recovered from smallpox, he would replace the ruined church of the Abbey of Sainte Geneviève with a new one. He recovered, and construction on the Pantheon began in 1755 and it was completed in 1780. The building stands 60 metres above the Seine, and is the high point of Paris' left bank.
<LF>Although the building began as a church, it has changed hands several times over the years, from church to state. In April 1791, the remains of Mirabeau were placed here - turning the building into a sort of secular mausoleum. Later, when his secret correspondence with the king was revealed, Mirabeau’s remains were removed. *
<LF>--<LF>* I bet he was livid. In fact, if he’d still had a grave, he’d probably have been spinning in it.

Collège des Quatre-Nations

Id: [0x00085B4D]
Cardinal Mazarin, once a mere deacon with much to atone for, left 2 million livres — part of his fortune amassed while governing France for 18 years — to build this college, as well as an annuity to house 60 fellows selected from the "four nations", namely the regions of Piedmont, Alsace, Flanders, and Artois. The college is one of the finest monuments in Paris. It houses the Institut de France and the superb Mazarine library with its 275,000 volumes, many of which were recovered from those who were guillotined or who emigrated, as well as from Louis XVI, labeled simply "Louis Capet". It also offers stunning views of the River the Seine. In 1793, this high place of learning was transformed into a prison, since Paris was essentially a huge prison at the time. Its first detainees included painter Jacques-Louis David, even though he had portrayed Marat in his bath, Doctor Guillotin, advocate of a painless republican death, and Madame de Tourzel, governess to the royal children. The chapel went on to become a sugar store reserved to a privileged few.

Palais et Jardin du Luxembourg

In 1612, Marie de' Medici*, widow of Henry IV of France, purchased houses there from the Duke of Piney-Luxembourg to build a sumptuous palace to the designs of French architect Salomon de Brosse. She wanted to call it the Medici Palace, but the Parisians—who hated her— kept using the name 'Luxembourg'. 

<LF>-<LF>* Yes, she's one of THOSE Medicis - but a hundred years after Ezio knew them…
<LF>-<LF><LF>In 1750, the Luxembourg became the first museum in Paris, where visitors could view paintings from the Royal collection.<LF><LF>In 1793, the Luxembourg Palace was briefly converted into the "Maison Nationale de Sûreté", or national prison.

<LF>--<LF>** Ouch, nice little dig there. Of course, you wouldn't expect an Abstergo historian to be sympathetic to an Assassin sympathiser, would you? Also, I think it’s fair to say that Danton kind of deserves it…
-<LF><LF><LF>In 1801, Bonaparte offered the building to the French Senate, the function it still serves today.  Transformations overseen by architect Alphonse de Gisors in 1836 modified the overall structure, to the extent that Marie de' Medici would probably not have recognized her former abode. The garden, however, is a favorite among Parisians.

Prior to the revolution, St-Germain-Des-Prés was a popular area for nobility to have their country houses and the town's abbey was one of the richest in France. The site's first church was raised in the year 558.
<LF>The Revolution effectively turned the abbey from church to storehouse, and 15,000 tons of gun powder were stockpiled in the refectory. Perhaps inevitably, an explosion destroyed part of the former abbey in August 1794. <LF><LF>Not that this prevented it from becoming the "Prison de l'Abbaye" where some of the most atrocious massacres would take place in September 1793. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Our sense of linear time, perhaps inevitably, exploded when Abstergo couldn't be bothered to fact-check their database.

Club des Jacobins

The delightful Marché Saint-Honoré market was founded on the site of the most famous convent in the history of France, that of the Jacobins, which would be razed to the ground in 1806. Thanks to Robespierre, this monastery became the epicenter of the revolutionary tumult. While all the important decisions were made at the National Convention, the real power lay with the Jacobin Club, so-called because of its meeting place in the church of the reformed Dominicans, namely the Jacobins. Relieved of nearly all its monks, this huge convent was situated a stone's throw from the National Assembly at the exact location of the current Marché Saint-Honoré. After their initial meetings held in the sumptuous library, and drawing on their success, the "Jacobins" occupied the church and installed amphitheater seating tiers where 1,500 patriots could come to hear the words of Barnave, Lambeth, Marat and Robespierre. It was very much a temple of impassioned discourse. *

La Bièvre

While the Bièvre is a small river like hundreds of others in France, the fact that it flows into the Seine in the very heart of the city meant that its economic importance surpassed that of its flow (an honorable 42 cubic meters per second nonetheless).*
<LF>--<LF>* I think that's historian code for 'it was a vast and thorough river of shit’.
<LF>-<LF><LF>The river runs for a length of 32 kilometers and, at its widest point, measures 4 meters. Today it is virtually out of sight, concealed by the urban landscape. The origin of its name is still subject to debate. Beber, beaver in Celtic? This is doubtful, since the river's weak current is hardly conducive to the survival of these busy, semi-aquatic rodents. And yet, this creature figures on the coat of arms of the small town of Bièvres, near to its source. However, beber also refers to the color of mud, which is the exact color of the river's water due to the clay-rich soils it churns up, well before the tanneries that pollute it further downstream. Another line of reasoning suggests that the name originates from the Latin verb bibere (""to drink"") as a result of the many bistros along its banks. A barside joke perhaps? **

Les Catacombes

Id: [0x00085B6A]
The Left Bank of Paris is built on rich limestone deposits, the stone from which built much of the city. Initially the stone was mined well out from the city proper, but as Paris expanded, it gradually covered even the mined-out areas. Since medieval mining involved digging a well down to the stone deposits and then tunneling horizontally until the vein was depleted, the result was a vast, intricate maze of tunnels beneath the streets. A series of building collapses beginning in 1774 proved that the tunnels could no longer be ignored, and in 1782, police lieutenant Thiroux de Crosne decided to act. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* By which they mean he decided to do something about the situation. Not that he decided to put on a small play.<LF>--<LF><LF>Thiroux had the quarries within an area of 240 hectares surveyed and registered. He saw the old mine shafts as an opportunity to solve another pressing problem: what to do with the bones of hundreds of thousands of dead people from the Innocents' Cemetery, which were so densely packed that they literally spilled out into the basements of adjoining buildings. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** Sleep well tonight.<LF>--<LF><LF>Thanks to Thiroux, 6 million deceased were crammed into the quarries, sometimes 30 meters thick. Among the mortal remains are those of Thiroux himself, along with 1,800 victims of the September Massacres of 1792. Later architects transformed the caverns into a proper mausoleum, complete with the following epigraph by poet Jacques Delille: "Stop! Here lies the empire of death." Bones and skulls were arranged in intricate patterns, and special chambers were set up, museum-like, to display samples of the various types of stone found beneath Paris and the innumerable skeletal deformities to be found among the catacombs' inhabitants. These unusual aesthetics have made the catacombs a popular tourist destination since the early 1800s.***<LF><LF>--<LF>*** Yeah. For sickos.<LF>--

In 1782, French writer Louis-Sebastien Mercier described Paris as follows: "Paris is too large, seen politically; it is an outsized head for the body of the state. But today, it would be too dangerous to remove the tumor rather than to let it subsist. There are diseases that, once they take root, are indestructible". <LF><LF>At the time of the French Revolution, Paris, with its 600,000 inhabitants, was no longer the largest city in Europe. London, with nearly one million inhabitants, had already surpassed it. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* It would be unbecoming of me to boast at this point.<LF>--<LF><LF>At the time, Paris was comprised of three main districts, each with its own specific historical characteristics. While the terms "rive gauche" (left bank) and "rive droite" (right bank) were increasingly commonplace by the end of the 18th century, "Université", "Cité", and "Ville" were still the names most commonly used. 

<LF>he Cité was the center of monarchic and religious power. It was home to the Bishop, the Parliament and the Senate. Underpinned by religious tradition, the seat of royal power was appropriately located beside Nôtre-Dame-de-Paris. 
<LF>Further south on the left bank was the district known as the Université, or Latin quarter, since the language taught there was Latin. Up to 30,000 students could be found there in any one year. 
<LF>To the north, on the right bank, was the Ville, the merchant city and home to the Hôtel de Ville (city hall), in other words, the municipal authority personified by the Prévôt des marchands (provost of the merchants) and the aldermen.

Harlay divided the square, situated away from the traffic on the bridge, into twelve lots in 1608. The houses built were rented by artisans, tailors, printers, booksellers and officers of the nearby Palais de Justice. <LF><LF>Up until 1633, one of the main attractions of this square, then a clutter of little houses, was the trestle stage used by the famous Parisian farceur Tabarin (Antoine Girard), who put on short, Italian-style performances with his brother and their little theater troupe.

The meticulous chronicler Sebastien Mercier left evidence of the tens of thousands of children abandoned in Paris. Mercier spoke of these "exposed children" who were often left on the steps of churches (the most famous among them was the philosopher d'Alembert), or in the towers of convents. The Hôpital de La Charité, or Charity Hospital, was supposed to accommodate them with the income from certain fines, but new facilities were needed. With the financial support of Chancellor d'Aligre (a city square and a market bear his name), Queen Maria Theresa founded this hospice in 1670, situated on what is now the Square Trousseau. A subsidiary establishment would be built on the forecourt of Notre-Dame.

The taking — and subsequent destruction — of the Bastille would provide an unexpected and fortuitous supply of stone at minimum cost: The stones from the ancient fortress were reused to build this bridge, which spanned from the Palais Bourbon to the Place de la Revolution (and its guillotine). The bridge was completed in 1791 and was named Pont de la Révolution, later to be called Pont de la Concorde.

Pont Neuf

This "New Bridge" is now the oldest existing bridge in Paris. The laying of the first stone on May 31, 1578 was a tearful occasion for Henry III, who had just lost two of his favorite mignons in a duel: the king was coming out of the funeral service and it was raining. Always ready for a laugh, the Parisians subsequently dubbed the bridge "le pont des Pleurs", or the bridge of tears. The Pont Neuf was a unique bridge in its time: the first to be built in stone; the widest; the most accessible; and, unlike the other bridges of Paris back then, no houses were built along the bridge's spans.

Pont au Change

Although many times destroyed and replaced (in the early 1400s a few wooden planks served the purpose), some form of bridge existed at this spot in Paris since nearly the founding of the city.

Pont Saint-Michel

The first bridge on this location was built during a lull in the Hundred Years' War, in around 1378. It was named after the small nearby chapel of Saint-Michel (in the enclosure of the Palais du Roi) which also lent its name to the district. It was the first location of a fixed bridge linking the Cité to the left bank. Like all other bridges at the time, it was fragile, and often ravaged by flood waters. At the time of the Revolution, it was lined with 32 houses which would only be demolished in 1809.

One thing that can be said for this bridge is that it has never changed names in 2,000 years despite the various floods and fires that would ravage and occasionally destroy it.  The bridge has always been heavily used since it was the outlet to the Roman roads leading to Orléans and Lyon. It was also the obligatory passageway for students who attended the schools on the left bank hill of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève.

The Pont Marie was named after its engineer, Christophe Marie (and not the Holy Virgin), who appealed to Henry IV to build a double wooden bridge across the Ile Saint-Louis. Despite Henry's assassination, the project continued; the bridge would later be renovated in stone. The enterprising Marie completed his assignment after collecting 20 years of toll charges. He was also tasked with creating the quays that encircled the island and plotting its streets. The first stone of the north bridge was laid on October 11, 1614, and would be completed in 1630. In 1658, part of the bridge and the houses built atop it were destroyed by a flood, an all-too-common disaster in Paris at the time. About the time of the Revolution, the last remaining houses were demolished.

The Pont de la Tournelle replaced a wooden bridge constructed in 1370 whose complicated name, "Pont de fust de l’isle Notre-Dame et Saint-Bernard" did little to make it popular. Washed away by a flood, it was finally replaced by a stone construction in 1656. La Tournelle (for turret) was a small fortress that was well known among Parisians since it served as a "comfortable" prison reserved for galley slaves, thanks to the caring priest Saint-Vincent-de-Paul. Public charity thus supported these galley slaves! However, on September 3, 1792, the prisons 63 convicts were butchered by drunken patriots worked up to a frenzy by the diatribes of Marat, and who had no doubt mistaken the convicts for dangerous counter-revolutionaries.

To stabilize his throne, he converted to Catholicism, possibly uttering the apocryphal remark: “Paris is worth a mass.” Although much beloved by his people, he was assassinated while riding in his carriage by religious fanatic François Ravaillac in 1610. During the Revolution, the spot on which his statue stands was used as a meeting point and even as a recruiting office for volunteers willing to fight the Prussians.

Place Vendôme

Id: [0x00085BAD]
Louis XIV purchased the existing hôtel Vendôme and a part of the convent des Capucines to embellish the city and facilitate traffic ... and provide a setting for a statue of himself dressed as a Roman emperor. Louis XIV also profited financially by selling the land behind the housefronts (which the king had financed). All the prominent financiers bought in. These buyers represented the cream of Parisian high society. They were followed by the more modest tenants of the attic apartments, such as Vigny. The statue of Louis XIV in roman attire was inaugurated on August 13, 1699 for his birthday. It was hacked down in August 1792 to make cannon*.<LF> <LF>--<LF>*Hacking down statues of kings to make artillery is actually a storied tradition – the Americans did it to New York’s statue of George III during the American revolution as well.

Filles du Calvaire Convent

Id: [0x00085BB5]
The convent, of which nothing now remains, was situated in the heart of the lively district on rue de Turenne. It was founded by Père Joseph in 1622. The Revolutionaries expelled the last remaining sisters and transformed the chapel into a theater dubbed "Le boudoir des muses". It was situated next to the famous boulevard du crime, named after the many melodramas that played in its theaters. The theater ran until 1807 before it was closed by the Empire.

Église Les Célestins

Id: [0x00085BB8]
This church was built in 1352, funded by Pope Celestine V from his own funds. The chapel once held the hearts of Henry II, Francis II, and Henry III, but by 1792, the church was no more and its gardens had become a barracks. The hearts of the kings were safely transferred to the Louvre, to Saint-Denis and to the museum of Versailles.*<LF><LF>--<LF>* And there was you thinking the Royals were heartless.<LF>--

Église St. Gervais-St. Protais / Place d’Orme

Id: [0x00085BBC]
Named after the twin martyrs Gervasius and Protavius, for 300 years this beautiful church looked out over a huge ancient elm (“orme”) that gave shade to creditors resolving their affairs in the middle ages. On the site of an ancient basilica, the current church was first built in 1494 with the Greco-Roman façade added in 1616. Voltaire, no religious enthusiast, proclaimed the church to be a masterpiece. Chopped down under the Revolution (which preferred the trees of Liberty), the elm was recycled into gun carriages. The church itself is now an animated place of worship, with a very active congregation of nuns.

Grand Arsenal

Id: [0x00085BC0]
This munitions store took up an entire neighborhood between the right bank of the River Seine and the present-day boulevard Morland, extending almost all the way to the Bastille. Its entry was at the corner of rue du Petit-Musc and the embankment.<LF><LF>The only remaining part of this vast complex is the library, established by the marquis de Paulmy, minister of war, who left some 100,000 volumes and 10,000 manuscripts. This collection was supplemented by works seized from the archives of the Bastille and from the abbeys of Paris. The library today holds approximately one million volumes, and 250,000 documents. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Impressive. Until you remember you’ve got the whole Internet on your phone.
<LF>-<LF><LF> The library was a place of study for such noteworthy names as Lamartine, Hugo, Dumas, Vigny, Musset and the Parnassien poets. **<LF><LF>--<LF>** Given they’re talking about a library, you’d think they’d have at least put those names in alphabetical order.

Hôtel Fieubet

Id: [0x00085BC4]
A spectacular accumulation of styles, the overall inconsistency of which gives the edifice its charm. The site was chosen by Charles V for his Hôtel Saint-Pol, away from the bustle of the Louvre. In 1676, parliamentary adviser Gaspard Fieubet commissioned Jules-Hardouin Mansart (him again!) to draw up plans for his new abode. Fieubet was a charming and popular poet, friend of Jean de La Fontaine and Madame de Sévigné. He was also Councilor of State and chancellor to Queen Maria Theresa (wife of Louis XIV). Hardly surprisingly, financial means were no obstacle.

Hôtel de Sully

Id: [0x00085BC6]
In 1634, the Duc de Sully, a fairly dashing 74-year old, expanded his townhouse to include a building at the bottom of the small garden which — still today — juxtaposes the Place des Vosges (then the Place Royale). By now a tad senile, he was known to prance about under the square's arcades wearing outdated jewelry. Meanwhile, his wife, who was 50 years his junior, went from one lover to the next.

<LF>t was from the terrace of this hôtel that Madame de Sévigné and her friends watched the poisoner and alleged sorceress Catherine Deshayes, known as "La Voisin", being carted away to be burned at the stake at the place de la Grève on November 10, 1680.

I<LF> was also while coming out of this same hôtel that the young Voltaire, already the darling of Parisian society, was set upon by the servants of nobleman Chevalier de Rohan, who later had him imprisoned at the Bastille. They had quarreled over an actress. Voltaire was later cleared and would receive an annuity of 1,200 livres.

Petit Arsenal

Id: [0x00085BCA]
The Petit Arsenal was a complex of buildings built around the Cour du Salpêtre and the Cour de l'Orme, overlooking the Bastille. *
<LF>- <LF>* “Wonderful, enigmatic views of the prison,” the estate agents would have said. Never trust a French estate agent. They invented the word “bijou”.

<LF>A public promenade lined with elm trees connected the Grand Arsenal and the Petit Arsenal, a stone's throw from the Bastille along the canal Saint-Martin.

Place des Vosges

Id: [0x00085BCC]
This square was originally named the Place Royale by Henry IV, who oversaw the design of its 36 pavilions. The king had requested perfect symmetry, four arcades and two rows of high windows for each pavilion. The square obliterated the field where, some decades before, Henri II had suffered a mortal wound in a jousting tournament and died in a building nearby. With the advent of the Revolution, it was no longer acceptable to carry a name honoring royalty, and the square underwent several name-changes before, in 1792, settling upon a name to honor the regiment of volunteers from the Vosges who came to save the Republic*. <LF>--<LF>*Since the historian doesn’t want to be specific about what the Republic was saved from, I’m going to let you pick your preference from the following list: Austrians, Martians, Zombie Hordes.

Église Saint-Leu

Id: [0x00085BD0]
Saint-Leu and Saint Gilles lent their names to this church, situated in the bustling rue Saint-Denis, since 1320 (it was originally the Saint-Gilles chapel before being extended to become the Saint-Leu church). Extensively and repeatedly reworked since then, only its facade is now of any architectural significance.

Les Halles

Id: [0x00085BD2]
Yet another city within the city, Les Halles was appropriately known as the "belly of Paris" since this is where Parisians bought their groceries each morning. <LF>--<LF>* There’s a fat French bloke downstairs we call the “belly of Paris” too.
--<LF>Before becoming a market, it was an expanse of "little fields", confirmed by the names of two streets, rue des Petits-Champs and rue de la Croix des Petits-Champs.<LF><LF>The market operated up until 1866, when architect Victor Baltard completed his massive glass and iron market pavilions after 12 years' work. It was a model that all of Europe would imitate. Not until the 1970s was it finally pulled down and replaced by the present-day concrete jungle, over which a huge glass canopy was recently installed.

Hôtel des Menus Plaisirs

Id: [0x00085BD4]
Built at the command of Louis XV to house the organization responsible for preparing royal ceremonies and festivals, the Hôtel des Menus Plaisirs in Versailles is most famous as the site of the Estates General in 1789. During the Revolution, it served variously as a courthouse, barracks, and bread distribution center. Much of the historic building was destroyed in 1800, when the property was sold to a private citizen. Today, the site is home to the Centre de Baroque Musique de Versailles.

Cour des Miracles

Id: [0x00085BD6]
The Cour des Miracles was one of the poorest, most dangerous slums in Revolutionary Paris. It took its name from the many beggars who faked terrible injuries and diseases to elicit donations, only to be miraculously "cured" when it was time to go home. *<LF><LF>-- <LF>* You’d think the name would have been a good tip off for people.

Boulevard des théâtres

Id: [0x00085BD8]
Thanks to Jean-Baptiste Nicolet and his royally-approved theater, "dubbed Spectacle des Grands Danseurs et Sauteurs du Roi," the Boulevard du Temple in the north of Paris developed into what could be called a continuous fair. The theater brought in all types of entertainment, along with cafés, caterers and wine merchants. In addition to shows inside the venue, actors were hired to play out small scenarios called "parades" on a balcony in front of the theater in order to attract spectators. The construction of several theaters towards the end of the 18th century (no less than 16 new theaters built between 1774 and 1789) prompted the establishment of entertainment networks that became ongoing fairs. The Revolution merely expedited this desire to free the theater from the oppression of an Ancien Régime that prevented the public from expressing itself. At the National Convention, Robespierre commended the educational side of theatrical arts and, on January 13, 1791, the National Assembly abolished royal privileges, unshackled the theater, and acknowledged—as human rights—author's royalties, which had been written off on August 4, 1789, along with other privileges.

Place de la Révolution / Concord / Louis XV

Id: [0x00085BDA]
Located at the very heart of Paris between the Champs Élysées to the west, and the Jardin des Tuileries to the east, the Place Louis XV was built in honor of the King in 1772. Its purpose was to evoke royal omnipotence. *

<LF>-<LF>* That’s quite an intimidating brief to get. 
<LF>We would like this building to evoke royal omnipotence”. 
<LF>Right. Royal omnipotence. So… is that like royal incontinence?”
“<LF>o, it is absolutely not like that.”
<LF>No, of course not, no. So do you mean like royal impotence, is that it?”
<LF>Not exactly. To be honest, I think we’re going to need some new builders.”
-<LF><LF><LF>It was the scene of the tragic festivities surrounding the marriage of the dauphin (the future Louis XVI) and Marie Antoinette, in which, according to official figures, 132 people were trampled during a fireworks display. Twenty-three years later, Louis XVI was executed in the same plaza, now called the Place de la Révolution. Marie-Antoinette followed a few months later. The guillotine was installed at the Place de la Révolution permanently from May 19, 1793 until June 13, 1794. In these thirteen months, some 1,500 men and women would lose their heads.

Le Marais

Id: [0x00085BDC]
Located in the heart of Paris, the Marais district's finest hours would come during the 17th century when the many aristocrats who lived there transformed it into a fashionable district. In the 18th century, the nobility gradually abandoned the district in favor of the Faubourg Saint-Honoré or the Faubourg Saint-Germain. 
<LF>In spite of this departure, the Marais would always retain its image as an aristocratic district, which meant that, with the coming of the Revolution, rioters would set about destroying the many symbols of royalty and nobility that were found there. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* It was a wonderfully convenient sort of one-stop-shop for those of the riotous persuasion.<LF>--<LF><LF>With the Revolution, the district changed progressively. The abandoned townhouses were taken up by merchants to form warehouses or workshops. The beautiful homes were thus preserved. And so the Marais became inhabited by more modest people who kept shops or practiced craft trades, which in turn gave way to small factories and semi-industrialized trades of the 19th century.

Saint-Marcel

Id: [0x00085BDE]
Along with the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the Faubourg Saint-Marcel, located on the left bank in the south of Paris, was the city's other foremost working-class neighborhood. The River Bièvre runs through it. 
<LF>The district was renowned for its tanneries, for the manufacture of blankets, as well as for hosiery, dyeing and laundry. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Sounds like a crazy place where anything could happen.<LF>--<LF><LF>The imposing Manufacture des Gobelins, where the finest tapestries in France were produced, was located here. <LF><LF>The district was made famous by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's description: "I had imagined a city of a most imposing appearance, as beautiful as it was large, where one could see only splendid streets and palaces of marble or gold. As I entered the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, I saw nothing but dirty, stinking little streets, wretched black houses, a general air of squalor and poverty, beggars, carters, menders of clothes, sellers of herb-drinks and old hats. All this so affected me at the outset that all the real magnificence I have since seen in Paris has not been sufficient to efface my first impression, and I have always retained a secret aversion against living in the capital.” **

La Madeleine

Id: [0x00085BE0]
Situated alongside the very chic faubourg Saint-Germain, the Madeleine Church was primarily designed by Guillaume-Martin Couture, who drew his inspiration from Jacques-Germain Soufflot's Église Sainte-Geneviève, the future Panthéon. 

I<LF> 1789, with the taking of the Bastille, the construction work ground to a virtual halt. Only the foundations and the grand portico had been completed. On December 30, 1791, work on the church was ordered to stop; the Revolution was hardly an advocate of religion*. After his execution in 1793, Louis XVI was buried behind the church. In 1794, the basement was leased to a wine merchant who used it to store his merchandise**. Only in the 19th century was the edifice finally completed. <LF><LF>--<LF>*… would be a mild way of putting it, yes. 
<LF>* Or to put it another way, Templars.

Café Théâtre

Id: [0x00085BE4]
Opened on Île Saint-Louis in 1759, the Café Théâtre was one of Paris’ premiere coffee houses for decades. Intellectuals, poets, philosophers and actors flocked to its tables, and the salon was a center for political debate and discussion. Over the years, though, cafés like the Café Procope gradually supplanted it in prominence. By 1790, Café Théâtre was a shabby, rundown place, more likely to host a second-rate bawdy comedy show than an impassioned debate. It experienced a resurgence during the Revolution, and even opened several satellite locations around Paris, and remained a fixture of the city’s intelligentsia through World War I.*

--
* I<LF> was also a central clearinghouse for the Parisian Brotherhood’s intelligence gathering network, a concept that is so adorably French I don’t even have the words for it.

"On several occasions, I have observed the subject conversing with known members of the suspected organization. His movements would not be inconsistent with those of someone attempting to influence the course of events, nor inconsistent with those of someone opposed to both the Terror and to aristocracy. Recommendation: continued observation with license to impose "final intervention."

The subject 'appeared in harmony with the Brotherhood's goals.' Adding this information to our recent observations leads, I believe, to the inevitable conclusion."

Anno 1561<LF>I have been increasingly subject to visions composed of obscure sentences and strange characters which carry meanings beyond my understanding. The visions were of such force that, overcome, I passed into a trance. Therein, I saw a weighty disc burst into many fragments, which themselves were dispersed across a Paris I could scarcely recognize, such were the changes. Each fragment of the disc accompanied by quatrains of unknown meaning, and to each of those, a symbol assigned. Upon awakening, I have written here the words and the symbols to each associated. It is for someone more learned than I to solve their meanings and recover whatever of value they protect.<LF>--Nostradamus

Born in 1746, Antoine Fouquier-Tinville was appointed director of one of the grand juries of the tribunal established on August 17, 1792 to try the royalists arrested on August 10 after the fall of the monarchy. In November of the same year, he became public prosecutor. In September 1793, the Reign of Terror became a matter of major concern. In the words of Fouquier-Tinville, "heads were falling like tiles." *<LF>--<LF>* Oh yes. “Heads were falling like tiles”. A common phrase at the time, presumably because there were no decent French roofers in the 18th century. They were all too busy polishing.
-<LF><LF>As public prosecutor, he was in charge of prosecuting culprits and “bringing them to justice,” which generally meant condemning them to death or otherwise doing the Committee of Public Safety’s bidding. The day after the fall of Robespierre, he was relieved of his duties. A trial was brought against him in December 1794, When he was convicted, he pleaded in vain, "I have simply been the Convention's axe, does one punish an axe?" **

Carmelite nuns

Id: [0x0008765E]
The confiscation of the clergy's properties, decreed by the National Assembly in November 1789, was opposed by many of those who belonged to religious orders, including the Carmelite nuns of Compiègne. In February 1790, with the dissolution of the monastic orders, French nuns were asked to return to their homes, however they refused. Ousted in 1792, they found refuge at the homes of villagers, however with the Reign of Terror in 1794, houses were searched to ensure that no nuns were being hidden. Sixteen Carmelite nuns were arrested in June 1794 and held at the Conciergerie in Paris. During the ensuing trial, prosecutor Fouquier-Tinville affirmed that they were accused of "having secret counter-revolutionary meetings and continuing to be loyal to their religious order and their authority." They were guillotined at the place du Trône on July 17, 1794. On May 27, 1906, they were beatified by Pope Pius X.

Following her husband’s interests, Madame Lavoisier made a serious study of chemistry herself and thereafter played an active role in her husband's scientific experiments and discoveries. In addition to her work in the laboratory, she translated books from English to French to allow Antoine-Laurent to further his scientific knowledge. Following her husband's execution, she protested vehemently against the arbitrary nature of the proceedings. She duly attended to her husband's posterity, gathering his papers and organizing the publication of his memoirs posthumously.

At the time of the Revolution, counter-revolutionary bastions established themselves within France, the most famous and powerful of which was “Les Chouans” in the Vendée region of western France. Les Chouans rejected conscription into the national army and, alarmed by the radical anti-clerical direction of the Revolution, raised their own troops to oppose it. More largely, the term “Chouans” came to be associated with rural, anti-revolutionary, pro-royalist sentiment. *

Born in 1767, Louis-Antoine de St-Just quickly sided with the revolution. In 1791, he was elected to the legislative assembly. He made a name for himself when he addressed the Convention at the trial of Louis XVI, stating: "A king must reign or die." His words met with prolonged applause. Saint-Just was the first to openly pronounce what many thought, but did not dare to say. In September 1793, the French Revolution veered dramatically towards terror. The Committee of Public Safety increasingly asserted its far-reaching power; especially it’s leaders: Robespierre, Couthon, Collot d'Herbois and Saint-Just. Perhaps due to his extreme positions, a legend eventually grew insinuating that Saint-Just had clothing made from human skin in the tanneries of Paris. With the fall of his friend and colleague Robespierre, he too met the "widow" on 10 Thermidor year II (July 28, 1794).

Id: [0x0008766E]
Swiss-born banker, financier and politician, Jacques Necker was an advocate of the ideas of the Enlightenment. Louis XVI appointed him Director General of the Treasury, then of Finance, in 1776. It was Necker who suggested that the King use loans in order to finance the support that France intended to offer to the American insurgents during the war of independence. When France's debt grew too large, he was forced to resign. Called back in 1788 to remedy the situation, Necker was seen by the populace as a voice of reason. He advised the King to summon the Estates-General. When that didn’t work well for the king, Necker was again dismissed on July 11, 1789, sparking an uprising at the Palais-Royal under the instigation of Camille Desmoulins, and, indirectly, the attack on the Bastille three days later. Necker was recalled one last time before resigning on September 3, 1790. He then retired to Switzerland to concentrate on writing works about finance and the economy.

His two brothers had been sent to the borders to fight the Prussians, while Joseph, too young to join the army, was sent to the Vendée as drummer boy. He died in an ambush near Jallais. It was probably a simple horse-theft gone awry; nevertheless, a legend grew that counter-revolutionaries had tried to force him to declare "Long live the King!" to which he retorted: "Long live the Republic!" For which he was killed. The image of the fallen boy was seized upon by Robespierre himself, proclaiming, “Only the French have 13 year-old heroes.” Bara was interred in the Pantheon as a hero of the revolution. In December 1793, painter Jacques-Louis David completed his work entitled The Death of Joseph Bara.

Josephine de Beauharnais

Id: [0x00087676]
Born in Martinique, Marie Josèphe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie came to France and married Alexandre de Beauharnais in 1779. Her husband, a member of the nobility, fell to the Revolution and was executed. Subsequently, she became a popular guest at many a society party, eventually catching the eye of an on-the-rise Napoleon Bonaparte, who was in the market for a wife. Josephine, a few years older than Bonaparte, was considerably more sophisticated than he. She initially married him to ensure financial security, and their initial years were marked by infidelity and considerable time apart while he was off at war in Italy and Egypt. However, the passion grew, and, years later after Napoleon had divorced her and remarried in search of an heir, he insisted that she retain the title of Empress. Josephine retired to the Château de Malmaison where she died in 1814.

Louis-Dominique Cartouche

Id: [0x00087678]
Born near the Temple in Paris, the man who came to be known only as Cartouche robbed carriages on the roads and mansions in the city. And yet, despite his brigandage, chicanery and non-stop misdeeds, Cartouche became popular with the Parisian populace: he was known to target the rich in what was otherwise a bleak period marked by economic crises and meager means of subsistence. There were a number of songs in praise of Cartouche. Betrayed by a henchmen, he was locked away in the Grand Châtelet before being broken on the wheel on November 28, 1721, at the place de Grève in front of a large crowd eager to see the robber who had for so long defied the police and, indirectly, the monarchy.*
<LF>-<LF>*Missed out the bit about his years with the Brotherhood. Ah, the crafty cozener. “Broken on the wheel?” There’s a story in that.

Camille Desmoulins

Id: [0x0008767A]
When news of Necker's dismissal reached Paris on July 12, a certain 29 year-old lawyer, Camille Desmoulins, leapt atop a table in the Palais Royal, brandished a pistol and urged the volatile crowd to take arms (two days later the Bastille was stormed). Desmoulins, an ardent member of the political Cordeliers Club, founded and authored the newspaper “Le Vieux Cordelier.” A friend and political ally of Danton, Desmoulins’ writings were highly influential but his politics, always highly republican, began to look conservative as the Revolution radicalized. Eventually, his childhood friend Robespierre helped to condemn Desmoulins and Danton to the guillotine.

Jean-Dominique Cassini

Id: [0x0008767C]
An astronomer from a family of scientific men, Cassini was born at the Paris Observatory on June 30, 1748. In 1770, he entered the Royal Academy of Sciences and would gradually take his father's place at the Paris Observatory. During the Revolution, Cassini was commissioned to rethink the system of measurement. He thus set about devising the metric system. Cassini also participated in the plotting of a general map of France. His aristocratic background brought him into conflict with the National Assembly, who began opposing his plans for the Observatory. He eventually resigned and was subsequently imprisoned. Released seven months later, he withdrew to his provincial château de Thury.

Jean-François Champollion

Id: [0x0008767E]
Champollion was a student of oriental languages, particularly Arabic and Persian, at the prestigious Collège de France. He showed extraordinary linguistic talent and began to learn Coptic. A proficient scholar, he was appointed professor of history at the University of Grenoble, aged only eighteen. Champollion was fortunate in obtaining a copy of the transcripts of the Rosetta Stone and put forward the idea that the stone's hieroglyphs consisted of both ideograms (which express ideas) and phonograms (which express sounds). He eventually deciphered the hieroglyphs, which led him to reveal an unknown chapter of Egyptian history.

Nicolas de Condorcet

Id: [0x00087680]
Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat, marquis de Condorcet was born in 1743. An exceptional student, he entered the Royal Academy of Sciences in 1769, where he developed his mathematical theories working on statistics and probabilities. With the Revolution, Condorcet, who was close to the philosophers of the Enlightenment, believed that the sweeping events could allow for better public use of reason. He founded a number of journals and ardently defended the cause of women, affirming that he was in favor of women's suffrage. In 1791, he was elected deputy and became secretary of the Legislative Assembly where he lobbied for educational reform. He voted against the execution of Louis XVI, which made him a suspect in the eyes of his fellow deputies. On October 3, 1793, a warrant was issued for Condorcet's arrest, whereupon he went into hiding. He hid for nine months in the house of Madame Vernet. It was there that he wrote one of his most esteemed text: Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Spirit, published posthumously. Arrested in March 1794, he was later found dead in his cell. It was believed that he had poisoned himself.

Ah! Ça ira!

Id: [0x000876A4]
According to legend, "Ça ira" was inspired by Benjamin Franklin during his stint as Ambassador to France. When asked about the American war of independence, he would reportedly reply: "Ah! Ça ira! Ça ira!" (Ah! It’ll be fine!) The music existed before the lyrics and was played upon the harpsichord by Marie Antoinette, who was particularly fond of this tune, on special occasions at Versailles. The initial words were quite harmless, basically a refrain of “It will be fine,” over and over. But in 1790 they were changed to, "Ah ! Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira. Les aristocrates à la lanterne. Ah! Ça ira, ça ira, ça ira, Les aristocrates, on les pendra!" (Ah! It'll be fine, It'll be fine, It'll be fine. The aristocrats — to the lamp-post. Ah! It'll be fine, It'll be fine, It'll be fine. The aristocrats, we'll hang them!"). The song thus became the rallying cry of the Parisian sans-culottes in the Revolutionary riots.

Composed in 1789 for the formation of a Parisian National Guard, the revolutionaries took the popular tune from the song "il pleut bergère" and added words intended to encourage men to join the guard's ranks and defend the nation.

La Carmagnole

Id: [0x000876A8]
La Carmagnole was one of the most popular songs of the French Revolution. Written in 1792 in the wake of the monarchy's fall on August 10, the song became known throughout France and was one of many adopted by the Parisian sans-culottes. La Carmagnole was traditionally sung while holding hands in a circle. With the chorus, the circle of dancers spun around faster and faster. In Paris, the crowd often danced around the guillotine to celebrate the execution of counter-revolutionaries. The Supplement to the Dictionary of the Academy defines the expression "Faire danser la carmagnole à quelqu'un" (making someone dance the carmagnole) as putting someone to death by guillotine or by any other form of torture used at the time. A number of different versions of La Carmagnole exist. They were often adapted to the political, social and economic context of events. This explains why the versions of 1792 and 1795 are respectively very different in terms of the words.

La Marseillaise

Id: [0x000876AA]
On April 20, 1792, the Assembly declared war on the "king of Bohemia and Hungary." The homeland was in danger and had to be defended at any cost. A few days later at the request of the mayor of Strasbourg, a young officer, Rouget de Lisle, sang a rather violent song which he had composed for the army of the Rhine: "Allons enfants de la Patrie, Le jour de gloire est arrivé ! Contre nous de la tyrannie, L'étendard sanglant est levé, Entendez-vous dans les campagnes, Mugir ces féroces soldats ? Ils viennent jusque dans vos bras, Égorger vos fils, vos compagnes ! Aux armes, citoyens, Formez vos bataillons, Marchons, marchons ! Qu’un sang impur, Abreuve nos sillons !" (Arise, children of the Fatherland, The day of glory has arrived! Against us tyranny Raises its bloody barrier. Do you hear, in the countryside, The roar of those ferocious soldiers? They're coming right into your arms To cut the throats of your sons and women! To arms citizens, Form your battalions, Let us march, let us march! Let an impure blood water our furrows!) The music is said to be inspired from a Mozart concerto. In fact, the song was not made popular by the army of the Rhine, but by the volunteers from Marseilles who would take up the song and gradually transform it into an anthem. "La Marseillaise" became the rallying call to the French Revolution and embodied the values it sought to spread along with its conquests.

Le Chant du Départ

Id: [0x000876AC]
Written by poet Marie-Joseph Chenier to the music of Etienne Méhul, the "Song of the Departure" was often regarded as the "brother of the Marseillaise". It was sung for the first time following the French troops' victory at the Battle of Fleurus (June 26, 1794) against the coalition army (Great Britain, Hanover, Dutch Republic and Hapsburg Empire), and was reused a few days later on July 14, 1794 to celebrate the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. Originally entitled "Hymne à la liberté", it was renamed by Robespierre, who praised the lyrics as "magnificent poetry". The words glorify the fighting passion of the French, ready to take on the world in the name of republican freedom.

La Guillotine Permanente

Id: [0x000876AE]
When the guillotine was used for the first time on April 25, 1792, it was poorly received by the public, apparently disappointed by its speed of execution and lack of entertainment. Nonetheless, the instrument was declared the official form of execution. The song "The Permanent Guillotine" tells the story of Dr. Guillotin and how his invention came to be used for executing the guilty.

Prise de la Bastille

Id: [0x000876B0]
Composed in 1790, the song glorifies the events surrounding July 14, 1789, and recounts the episode that led to the taking of the Bastille. Rather than surrender, the Bastille's governor, De Launay, chose to resist. The text is unusual in that the taking of the Bastille is attributed to the bourgeoisie, and not to the people in general.

The Barber of Seville

Id: [0x000876B2]
The first of the plays from the Figaro trilogy by Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, the Barber of Seville (1775) tells the story of a gentleman from Seville, the Count Almaviva, who sets out to win the heart of Rosine, ward to the aging and unscrupulous Bartolo. This he achieves thanks to the ruse of his clever valet, Figaro. Almaviva, under the name Lindoro, disguises himself as a poor student to gain entry and upset Bartolo’s plans. Rossini used the play as a libretto for his opera of the same name in 1816.

The Marriage of Figaro

Id: [0x000876B4]
Written by the playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, the Marriage of Figaro played for the first time on April 27, 1784 at the all new Théâtre de l'Odéon in Paris. It followed on from the Barber of Seville. The play was popularly received as an indictment of the aristocracy: each of its five acts criticizes the privileges and hierarchies inherent to the Ancien Régime. In the play, the main character, the valet Figaro, must foil the plans of his master, the Count Almaviva, who intends to take advantage of his bride-to-be, Susanna. The defining moment of the play is Figaro's long monologue in the fifth act, when he directly challenges the Count: "What have you done to deserve such advantages? Put yourself to the trouble of being born, nothing more." At the time, such words were scandalous and, within his broad comedy, Beaumarchais had pithily summed up the logic of the coming Revolution. In 1786, Mozart composed music for an opera based on the play.

Designed in 1786 by watchmaker and inventor Robert Rousseau, the solar cannon allowed strollers at the Palais-Royal to adjust their timepieces: when the sun reached the meridian, a magnifying glass was arranged so that the sun's rays were directed to the touch hole of a small cannon. At noon precisely, it went off with a bang! A restored cannon works to this day.

A fragment of a larger stele engraved with three versions of the same text in three different languages, the Rosetta Stone is actually a decree issued on behalf of King Ptolemy V in 196 BC. It was discovered during Napoleon's campaign in Egypt. It was unique in that it offered Egyptologists the basis, in Ancient Greek, with which to decipher hieroglyphics. Jean-François Champollion deciphered the text to ultimately obtain the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphics.

Persecution of the Templars under Philip the Fair

Id: [0x000876BA]
When Philip IV of France, known as Philip the Fair, came to the throne in October 1285, he was determined to reorganize the kingdom's finances. The crown of France was in substantial debt to the Order of the Knights Templar, which had become an order of rich bankers. In order to seize its fortunes and destroy its political importance, Philip the Fair decreed the Order dissolved. He promptly arrested all the Templars in France, and urged other European sovereigns to follow suit. Arrested in Paris, 138 Templars faced the accusations of Guillaume Imbert de Paris, head of the Inquisition in France. Among other blasphemies, the Templars were accused of worshipping an odd idol: Baphomet. Legend has it that, at his execution, Jacques de Molay placed a deadly curse on his accusers: "Pope Clement! Chevalier Guillaume de Nogaret! King Philip! I summon you to the Tribunal of Heaven before the year is out! Curse you! Curse you! Curse you! Curse you all until the thirteenth generation of your progeny!" *<LF><LF>--<LF>* I’m totally using that the next time I’m thrown out of the local pub.

The La Voisin Poisonings

Id: [0x000876BC]
Catherine Deshayes La Voisin (1640-1680 began her career as a fortune-teller, but quickly expanded her services to help make her client’s fortunes come true. Indulging in both alchemy and black masses, she concocted a particularly subtle and effective poison that had no smell and left no trace. She employed it using an array of trick jewelry built with hidden compartments. Catherine had no love for her husband, nor sons for that matter, and was said to have attempted (or at least plotted) to poison them.*
<LF>--<LF>*Must have been a relaxing home to grow up in. <LF>--<LF><LF>Her daughter, Marguerite Monvoisin, on the other hand, seems to have joined in Catherine's plots, the most famous of which was a series of scandals known as the Affair of the Poisons. According to certain information collected by the authorities tasked with unmasking this conspiracy, La Voisin and a certain Madame de Montespan (once the King’s official mistress) plotted against King Louis XIV. La Voisin was convicted of the conspiracy and on February 22, 1680, she was she condemned to death and burned at the Place de Grève in Paris. Her daughter survived to carry on the family traditions.**

Potassium/Water Reaction

Until the 18th century, no distinction had been made between potassium and sodium. Only with the experiments of Humphry Davy, following from Lavoisier, was elemental potassium finally isolated. When combined with water, potassium forms potassium hydroxide, resulting in a violent, explosive reaction.

Flying Magnetic Boy Experiments

In the middle of the 18th century, a great many experiments involving electricity were conducted. In England, Stephen Gray demonstrated that the human body could become electrified. He suspended a young boy on silk ropes and, by generating static electricity to charge the boy's body, showed how the boy's hands took on a mysterious attractive power, allowing him to pull light objects towards him without touching them. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* I’d love to see the parental consent form for that. “I intend to suspend your young boy from silk ropes and then electrify him! Sign here!”
--<LF><LF> In France, French clergyman and physicist Abbé Nollet carried out the same experiment, and discovered that if a person brought a finger close to the boy's body, a spark was produced. It was said to be an "electric fluid" that passed from one body to another. **

Among the 19 cafés that comprised the Palais-Royal, the café Février was located at 113 Galérie de Valois. It was famous for two events.

Secondly, it was here that, on January 20 1793, Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau was assassinated.

In 1794, Claude Chappe developed a new means of communication via a practical system of semaphore relay stations. The relay line consisted of towers spaced between 12 and 25 kilometers apart, each fitted with a telescope. This made it possible to quickly transmit crucial information. And so, on September 1, 1794, in less than an hour, Parisians were informed of the capture of Conde-sur-L'Escaut from the Austrians, 220 kilometers away. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* Of course, some of the nuances of the message were lost along the way.

Opened in 1686 by the Sicilian Francesco Procopio Colteli, the Café Procope went on to become one of the most prominent cafés of the 18th century. The intellectual center of Paris had shifted from the cafés of the left bank to those of the right bank, and the Procope, situated at the time opposite the Comédie-Française, was an intellectual fervent meeting place of playwrights, chess-players, renowned actors, writers and philosophers. A list of the café’s noted patrons of the period would include: Voltaire, Diderot, Ben Franklin, Danton, Marat and Robespierre.

François De La Serre

Id: [0x000879AB]
Little information about François de la Serre survives. A minor nobleman, he kept an estate in Versailles and a smaller house in Paris, and was known to be a close confidant of the King and of Mirabeau. His wife, Julie, died sometime around 1777, and De La Serre was left to raise his daughter, Élise, on his own. He died under mysterious circumstances in 1789.*
<LF>--<LF>* You see this sort of whitewashing a lot when a notable Templar falls out of favor. Someone steps out of line, or fails to keep up with the time, and suddenly the rich tapestry that is a unique, lovely human being is reduced to a historical footnote about how terrible they are.<LF><LF>A bit like Americans and their celebrities, really.<LF>--

--<LF>* Hello. Cutting in here at the beginning, because this is BIG NEWS. It's not terribly often we get eyes on a Grand Master, even one who's been dead for a couple of centuries. And a Sage to boot? This has massive potential, and we're going to need to keep on him and find out what really happened to him. All the historical documentation I can find says he died in 1791, which, unless Arno invented time travel, means that the historical record is bollocks.<LF>--<LF><LF>A silversmith and son of a silversmith, Germain was one of the legends of his trade, but he was doomed to die in obscurity. After an ill-defined scandal, possibly involving a violation of Guild laws, he lost his position as silversmith to the King of France and was kicked out of his accommodation in the Louvre.* He employed dozens of workers in a workshop/factory that produced thousands of pieces, many of which have since been lost, stolen, or melted down.**<LF><LF>--<LF>* If there's a kind of scandal I love, it's the ill-defined kind.<LF>** I've got one.

Charles Gabriel Sivert

Id: [0x000879B1]
Born on December 1, 1725 in Louisbourg, New France, Sivert was the son of a lieutenant in the Swiss Régiment de Karrer. Like his father, Sivert chose to make his career in the army, serving in New France and the West Indies before returning to Europe in 1785, where he opened a shipping business.*
<LF>--<LF>* Right. A shipping business. Very diplomatic way of saying "Templar artifact smuggling." We've got data linking Sivert to everything from funding Haytham Kenway's operations in the American colonies to the disastrous attempt to recover... well, never mind, you're not cleared for that. Just keep an eye on this one, yeah?<LF>--<LF><LF>He died at Notre Dame de Paris on January 5, 1791.*<LF><LF>--<LF>* Assassins: 1, Templars: 0<LF>--

21. Medieval

Id: [0x0008821C]
The Late Middle Ages were a turbulent time for Europe, struck first by the Great Famine (1315-1322) and the Black Death, followed by social turmoil and warfare.<LF><LF>France was embroiled in the Hundred Years’ War with England, a conflict than ran from 1337 to 1453, as the two nations wrestled for control of the French throne. English expeditions into French soil, in which they would burn down crops and buildings, took their toll on the economy and the nation’s morale. This led directly to the Jacquerie, a peasant revolt in the north of Paris in 1358, which was followed by other uprisings, cementing France as a nation of unrest and presaging the revolution that was to take place much later*.

<LF>-<LF>*To the extent that two revolutions, four centuries apart, have anything whatsoever to do with one another.<LF>--<LF><LF>Towards the end of the 14th Century, the Bastille was constructed to defend Paris from the English threat, and played a vital role in internal conflicts. The stone required to build it was extracted from large quarries, parts of which were later used as ossuaries and known as the catacombs.<LF><LF>400 years later, the Bastille would become one of the symbols of the French Revolution when Parisians invaded the fortress.

19. Belle Époque

Id: [0x0008821F]
Belle Époque (literally “the Beautiful Age”) is the name given to the period between 1871, when the Franco-Prussian war ended, and 1914, when the First World War began. Once France was forced to endure the wars and hardships of the 20th Century, it was nostalgically thought of as a golden age, both prosperous and peaceful.*

-<LF><LF>* A better name for it would have been the If Only They Knew What Was Coming Époque. 
<LF>-<LF><LF>Paris, already referred to as the City of Light, grew in size and economic power thanks to technological advances. The Parisian quality of life improved as well*.<LF><LF>--<LF>* And they didn’t even have social networking then. 
<LF>ome to think of it, maybe it was a good time to be alive after all. Yeah? <LF>(Hashtag banter.)<LF>--<LF><LF>The 1889 World’s Fair exemplified the spirit of the times, and marked the construction of the Eiffel Tower, a symbol of France’s new engineering prowess and of the Belle Époque itself. Just as iconic is the Paris Metro, whose construction began in 1898 and which opened to the public two years later.
Ho<LF>ever, these weren’t the first grand accomplishments of the era. The Statue of Liberty was built over a decade earlier as a gift to the United States, representing the Roman goddess of freedom and celebrating American independence.
<LF>ut while Paris became the cultural capital of the world, and its arts and literature flourished, there was also political and racial tension. Anarchist groups* who saw nothing but bourgeois decadence in the culture of cafes and cabarets (such as the Moulin Rouge) resorted to acts of terrorism.<LF>Soon, a more widespread terror would put an end to this golden age, as war once again gripped the continent.

20. WW2

Id: [0x00088221]
German forces invaded France in 1940, arriving in Paris in June and establishing an occupying force that would last until August 1944.<LF><LF>Although a nominal French government operated from Vichy, in the south of the country, the Nazi administration ruled the North, and would come to control the whole of France by November 1942.<LF><LF>While the Vichy administration collaborated with the Germans, hoping for a swift end to the war, resistance fighters sprung everywhere and organised against the invaders. As a counter-measure, the Nazi regime deployed its intelligence service (the Gestapo) and its security police.<LF><LF>As the central icon of Paris, the Eiffel tower became somewhat of a symbolic battleground. Hitler ordered its demolition, but his orders were never carried out, and the Germans would later deck it with Nazi banners.<LF><LF>In 1944, the year of the liberation of Paris, the tower became a different battle arena, this one taking place in the air. US fighter pilot Captain William Overstreet pursued a German plane over the city, and damaged the fighter’s engine. The German pilot attempted to shake off his pursuer by flying close to the Eiffel tower, with some claiming they actually flew underneath it.* The ploy didn’t work though, and the Nazi plane crashed to the ground. The sight is said to have inspired the resistance fighters who saw it. A few weeks later, the Normandy landings (better known as D-Day) would begin the process of reclaiming France and the rest of Europe.

Paris<LF>September 23, 1788<LF><LF>Dear Arno,<LF>I never thought I could be so bored in Paris. Can you imagine it? The greatest city in the world, and here I am, stuck in endless lectures from dawn to dusk. It’s worse than that winter we spent in Strasbourg. Do you remember? When it snowed for a week straight and we couldn’t leave the house, and all the books in the library were in German? We convinced that cook the house was haunted by some young Frankish prince, and the poor man refused to leave his kitchen without a rosary in one hand and a Bible in the other.

<LF> miss those days. The things I’m learning from Father’s friends are—well, I wish I could tell you about them. Someday, perhaps, but not now, and not like this. But still I find myself missing those days. Missing home. Missing you. Next time Father comes to Paris, you must persuade him to bring you along.

Oh Arno, what have you done? I know we didn’t part on the best of terms, but to go running to the Assassins? My Father kept you away from them for a reason. Their Creed is like wine—sweet enough at first blush, and in moderation it makes life seem more bearable, but drink too deeply and you find naught but madness and anarchy.

<LF>o doubt they’ve already filled your mind with tales of how dreadful we Templars are, that we would make slaves of humanity and place our boots on the world’s neck. You knew my father, and you know me—I can only pray that is enough to give the lie to those tales. My Order has turned against me, and I am hunted by those I once called friend. I could not bear it if you turned against me also.

T<LF>ink of me and be well,<LF>Élise

Dear Arno,<LF><LF>I confess I’m not entirely sure what to say here. “It was good to see you again” somehow rings hollow, an empty space unfit to contain the totality of my feelings. And yet I am pleased—pleased that the Assassins have not changed you completely. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. You never were one to be easily awed.

It <LF>eems we have both found ourselves at an impasse in the hunt for my father’s killer. Perhaps together, we can accomplish what neither of us alone could. It’s nice to think that after all this time, we’re still better together than apart.

Dearest Arno,<LF><LF>I can barely conceive how much has changed in the last three years. How far our roads have taken us—sometimes I feared our paths would diverge forever, or else come together at loggerheads like the star-cross’d lovers in some hackneyed stage piece. Yet here we are, not the same brash children we once were, nor yet strangers.

<LF>hen this is over, when Germain is dead at our feet and my father rests, who then will we be? Assassin Mentor and Templar Grand Master? The continuation of the old, or the beginning of something new? Will we shape the future of our world, or will we retire quietly to the countryside to raise goats? (I can just see you as a goatherd, leaping and climbing about the Alps. No goat would have a chance of escaping you.)<LF><LF>I do not know what the next days, months, years will bring. All I know is that we shall remain Arno and Élise, and with that, I am content.

My love,<LF><LF>As I write this you are asleep. If the light wakes you, I’ll have some explaining to do, but at this moment you are sleeping peacefully. Tomorrow is the day, it seems—the culmination of five long years, our moment of revenge. So why can I not quiet this part of me which fears that, at the tipping point, you will flinch?

<LF>s it that I fear you loved my father less than I? Or do I doubt your resolve to strike the killing blow? I do not think so. Rather I fear that you have lost so much already that you cannot bear to lose more. I think that you would let Germain rule France if you thought it would “save” me.

<LF>ave you ever known me to need saving? Have you ever had cause to think that I would accept it if it were offered? My fate is my own. My choice is my own.<LF><LF>If somehow we both return from this, I will burn this letter. If you are reading it now, then I made my choice there in the Temple. Know that I made it gladly, and do not take the burden of it onto yourself. Be at peace, my love, and walk what path you will.<LF><LF>All my love,<LF>Élise

13 Vendémiaire

Id: [0x00088235]
The fall of Robespierre after his arrest on 9 Thermidor an II (July 1794) ended the Terror and led to a more "civilized" stage of the Revolution. It meant also a resurgence in the royalist activity, and in 1795, the Convention was afraid that monarchists might win the next election. As a precaution, it adopted in August 1795 a decree, called "of the two thirds" stating that 500 of the 750 members of the future two assemblies will be current members of the Convention*.<LF><LF>--<LF>* You think it had more to do with consolidating their power, don’t you? 
<LF> hate that you’ve become so cynical. 
<LF>nd well done.<LF>-- <LF><LF><LF>Those elections were scheduled for 20 Vendémiaire an IV (mid-october 1795), and Paris royalists were determined to make the Convention revoke the rule.  On 11 Vendémiaire, seven Paris sections declared themselves as insurgents. Some of the National Guard joined them.

<LF>he Convention ordered Barras to take military measures and, on the field, Bonaparte became the de facto military leader. On 13 Vendémiaire (October 5), the insurgents (some mention 25,000 people) marched on the Convention, at the Tuileries. Bonaparte had put in place a number of cannon (procured by Joachim Murat) and, after receiving the order from Barras, told the troops to open fire. Grapeshot was very efficient on such urban terrain, causing around 300 deaths among the Royalists.
<LF>That action earned Bonaparte the nickname of "Général Vendémiaire" and is considered by some as the true beginning of his rise to power**.

-<LF><LF>** Oh yes - Napoleon earned his fame firing grapeshot at crowds of protesters. What a hero! He also earned several enemies – can’t imagine why.

Le Champ de Mars

Id: [0x00088237]
The name of this green space (literally "Field of Mars") is a tribute to the Greek God of war, since its lawns were used by the French military as an exercise ground. Surrounded by ditches and trees, it was nevertheless left open to the civilian population, and even served as an occasional playground for Parisian balloonists. It was thus a favorite leisure spot in Paris, and would be the scene of the Revolution's key moments starting from 1790. <LF><LF>On July 14, 1790, despite heavy rain, a crowd of some 300,000 attended the "Fête de la Fédération" in honor of the anniversary of the Storming of the Bastille. *
--<LF>* Sounds lovely! We must visit!<LF>--<LF><LF>In November 1793, former mayor of Paris Jean-Sylvain Bailly was tortured for two hours by a frenzied mob in one of the field's ditches, before being beheaded by a purpose-built guillotine: "His execution was intended as an expiatory ceremony." **<LF>--<LF>** Actually, I’ll leave it.
<LF>-<LF><LF>On June 8, 1794, the Champ de Mars also hosted the Feast of the Supreme Being, devised and celebrated by Robespierre, subsequently frowned upon as a "parody" by his Jacobin colleagues, and which would hasten his downfall. <LF><LF>Levelled and extended, it would offer Gustav Eiffel the perfect spot for his giant steel structure 140 years later. Thereafter, the Champ de Mars served as the setting for princely weddings, national workshops and horse racing, followed by concerts and imposing firework displays in the 20th century.

Newspaper Stands and Printing Presses

Id: [0x00088239]
One of the most spectacular aspects of commerce during the revolutionary period was the boom in printing driven by the explosion in the number of publications. Before 1789, censorship tightly controlled the production of literary works, including periodicals. With the Revolution, however, the printing industry blossomed. In June 1789, only 5 newspapers were on sale. By December of the same year, the figure had risen to 130. Among the most important papers of the Revolution were Camille Desmoulins' "Le Vieux Cordelier," Jacques Brissot's Girondist "Le Patriote Français," Jacques-René Hébert's "Le Père Duchesne," and Jean-Paul Marat's "L’Ami du Peuple." These papers reached a huge number of Parisians, even those who were unfamiliar with reading, since it was not uncommon to find individuals who read articles aloud in the middle of the street to persuade others.

À la lanterne!

Id: [0x0008823B]
Before official authorities instituted the use of the guillotine during the Revolution, the mob improvised rough justice on their own. Often, simple lamp-posts (“lanternes”) were used to summarily hang the victim. The most famous lamp-post was found in the Place de Grève in front of the Hôtel de Ville. It was here in 1789 that the crowd strung up the hated Joseph-François Foulon de Doué, who was suspected of controlling the food supply. After his execution, ‘’À la lanterne’’ became a famous cry and is found in the most popular song of the day, ‘’Ça ira!’’ *

--
* I thin<LF> it gives us great insight into the French that one of their most popular songs is about a lamp-post.<LF>--<LF><LF>It was also the subject of one of Camille Desmoulins most recognized polemics.

The Feuillants

Id: [0x0008823D]
Like almost every political faction in the National Assembly, the Feuillants were an offshoot of the revolutionary Jacobins. However, the Feuillants opposed the complete destruction of the monarchy and hoped to negotiate shared power between the King and the Assembly. Their influence was completely undercut by the attempted escape of Louis XVI and his family in the flight to Varennes.

Jean-Paul Marat

Id: [0x0008823F]
Marat was a man of many talents: physician, politician, and most notably, radical journalist. His newspaper “L’Ami du people” (Friend of the People) brought him a great deal of notoriety during the French Revolution as an influential supporter of the sans-culottes and the radical Jacobin group. Following his role in the purge of the Girondists, there were some who felt his radical views would descend France into civil war. His notoriety would lead to his assassination on the 13 July 1793. This was immortalized in a painting by Jacques-Louis David that shows Marat stabbed to death in a medicinal bath. Marat had struggled with a debilitating skin condition his entire life and would often conduct his affairs while soaking in a bathtub.

Charlotte Corday

Id: [0x00088241]
A young woman best known for assassinating the radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat in 1793. Corday knew that Marat was a leading Jacobin with a hand in the “Reign of Terror” and felt his continued provocations would descend France into civil war. She entered his home under the guise of providing a list of Girondists that were planning an uprising in Caen. Upon receiving an audience with Marat she stabbed him in the chest as he soaked in a medicinal bath. Corday was executed for the murder 4 days later.

Jacques-Louis David

Id: [0x00088243]
A highly influential painter in the Neoclassical style, David was an active supporter of the revolution and a good friend of Maximilien Robespierre. His painting, “The Death of Marat”, in 1793, immortalized Marat, at the time, as a Jacobin martyr.

The legend goes that in 1793, Philibert Aspairt entered the Paris catacombs in an attempt to map them. He never came out. His body was supposedly found 11 years later, though his existence has never been officially confirmed. All that remains is a tomb in the Paris catacombs that says: “In the memory of Philibert Aspairt, lost in this quarry on November 3rd 1793, found eleven years later and buried at the same place April 30th 1804.”

Prince Rupert Drops

Id: [0x0008824A]
A teardrop shaped glass bead with a tail, this astonishing object delighted Europeans in the 17th century. Popularized in England by Prince Rupert who gave a few of them to Charles II in 1660, these drops are made by immersing molten glass in cold water. The outside of the glass quickly forms a shell that incases the pressure of the still-expanding molten glass within. Once the entirety has cooled, the glass shell is holding back enormous pressure and the bead can easily withstand hammer-blows. However, there is a glass tail to the drop, that when broken, releases all the energy, immediately reducing the drop to a fine, glass powder.

Cartouche Memoir 1

Id: [0x00088621]
(The manuscript is in very poor condition. Many pages are missing or illegible. However, it is possible to make out some paragraphs.)<LF>“Born into squalor, I have lived a life of debauchery, depredation and crime. It has been glorious. My youth was the usual series of petty thefts lived by all my companions in the northern reaches of Paris. At the age of fifteen, things took an unusual turn during the burglary of a charming mansion …”
(T<LF>o pages are scorched beyond readability.)<LF>“ … lest you assume that Mme de N-- played the knowing temptress Delilah to my innocent Samson, know I seized upon all temptations as a matter of honor. This particular one was simply more delightful than any I had known. Mme de N-- instructed me in the arts of pleasure. ‘You are by no means handsome,’ she told me severely. ‘Therefore, your weapon must be charm. Use it in abundance. Like wine, no one ever believes they have imbibed too much.’ My craggy scar and smashed nose, heretofore regarded as defects, became features that marked me apart. A crooked smile and engaging manner carried me much further than many a more well-formed swain. A gentle witticism can gain entry to unimagined …”
(Severa<LF> sentences are smudged with ash.)<LF>“She taught me also how to extract the fruit of an orange from within by way of a small slice to its covering. This skill proved to be of astonishing use. In fact, the priest banned me from the confessional – the details of my sins were too licentious for his shell-pink ears. I was consigned to sin and sin again (and again!) without hope of redemption.”
(H<LF>re, a number of pages are too stained and torn to be read.)<LF>“… we cornered the carriage on the road to Arras. Three dukes smoking within. Three dukes foolish enough to carry far too much silver and finery. Such a large bounty was not to be hoarded! The nobles continued their journey on foot in their underclothes, while we shared and spent their riches among the villagers and thus made allies along the route. Allies that were to prove useful throughout my life …”
(He<LF>e the bulk of the manuscript appears to have been simply lost. It recommences in the midst of Cartouche’s famous public execution.)
<LF>… searched the wild crowd for familiar faces and, you can be sure, there were some. Creased into their features, a mixed reaction to my plight and humiliation, for, dear reader, the human creature is given to many emotions, all contending for expression at the same instant. Indeed, it is rare that a simple emotion reigns in a human heart. And there, in those faces, faces of many I had helped in times of need, many who had thieved and briganded at my side, I discerned two humours vying for supremacy. The first – an anxious desire to help me and relieve me of my distress, perhaps even to live my punishment for me. However, the other emotion detected was of a darker hue – the desire to see a man torn to shreds; the desire for blood, pain and death. Even friends can lament one's loss and still revel in the gory spectacle. Such is the human animal.”
(Th<LF>s section of the memoir breaks off here.)

Cartouche Memoir 2

Id: [0x00088623]
(A second section. The story seems to pick up mid-tale. )<LF>“In the event, I was searching for one face only. Surely, she would wish me safe journey to death, even if it meant leaving the bed of another a few minutes early. Alas, I saw neither her raven ringlets nor her flashing eyes.
<LF> was roughly hauled onto the scaffold: the great wheel, the instrument built to inflict unimagined pain as a prelude to bloody death, stood before me. It appeared somehow too small for such a mortal purpose. The executioner pushed me against the rough-hewn logs and lashed leather straps, worn ragged by scores of damned souls before me, about my wrists and feet. At this moment he took an extraordinary action: he blocked the crowd’s view with his stout body and, in a thrice, shoved a wet, bulbous bag between my back and the wheel. “What?” I managed. He glanced at me and spat through his teeth, “Pig’s bladder. Filled with blood.” He then looked to the crowd. I followed his gaze, not daring to hope, but there! It was she! He was looking toward Mireille! Oh what a tide of emotion crashed upon my beaten soul in that moment. My beloved Mireille had come to rescue me, but at the price–this I could not doubt–of having yielded to the lusts of the brutish executioner. The man who looked me in the eyes and shoved a much smaller bladder into my mouth. “Bite when it’s time.” He raised his hand to quiet the crowd, then threw his massive weight onto the lever. The wheel gave an ancient groan as if awakening. My arms, legs and spine pulled up taut even while the straps cut into my flesh. The crowd erupted in delight and horror. The length of my body, a skein of pain. Ah! Such rapture flowed through the assembled masses! They shouted for more. More! In crazed desperation, I tried to physically pull back, as if I could by force of muscle and sinew prevent the wheel’s dread revolution. The giant pulled with greater force, pulling me into an excruciating stretch. Sweat now beaded my brow and, with yet another pull of the lever, began to stream down my chest. The small bladder in my mouth prevented me from screaming. In fact, it was difficult to breath. Another pull of the lever and I felt the very joints of my shoulders begin to pull apart. If this was rescue, it was of a dire sort. I gave into the wheel, no longer attempting to slow its progress, and progress it did. I felt a tendon in my leg spring loose, as if I were a cooked pigeon; then my upper arm separated from my shoulder with a sickly pop. The effect was, perversely, to lessen the pain, as now my body had slack in it. But this was short-lived. Again the lever creaked; again the crowd roared; again my muscles stretched near breaking. Surely the bladder much break! I attempted weakly to press back upon it to speed the deception, but another pull by the oafish torturer ended all thought of making an effort. He pulled and pulled and, yes! There! My other shoulder gave way. Oh, what a painful jolt I felt, my two arms freed of all anchor to myself! But this last was enough, the bladder beneath me broke, sending a spurt of red blood down my back and my legs, as if my entrails had exploded. The crowd went mad with joy, capped by the delirium they experienced when I chomped into the bladder between my teeth, filling my mouth with thick pig’s blood, which I spat out in disgust and fell back in a swoon. I lost all consc…”
(The next page<LF> seem to have been soaked in water sometime in the past. Nothing is legible until the very end.)<LF>“So it was that my apprenticeship began wherein I stole and sweated and committed crimes, no longer for myself and my recognition, but rather for an odd pack of scabrous folk: the Assassins. Of whom, Mireille was the leader. And, reader, my labors there must live and die forever in silence.”

Eugène François Vidocq

Born in 1775, Vidocq was but a lad during the French Revolution. He spent his youth as a petty thief and was frequently in jail. However, his association with thieves was to prove beneficial. By the Napoleonic era, he was working as an informant for the police and, eventually, became a policeman himself. *<LF><LF>--<LF>* They usually say crime doesn’t pay. For this fellow it not only paid, but came with a pension and medical.
<LF>-<LF><LF> In fact, he was one of the forefathers of the deductive method of crime-solving and founded a unit that grew to become the Sûreté, France’s premier crime-fighting organization. He always worked both sides of the law, but his criminal friends proved invaluable to him as a detective.

Born in 1730, as the third son of a wealthy importer of spices, Chrétien Lafrenière was destined for the Church. He studied at the Sorbonne and entered seminary school in 1750, but when his father and elder siblings died in a shipwreck off the coast of Mauritius, he left the seminary to take the reins of his family’s business. Most of his income, however, seems to have been spent joining and founding numerous secret societies and fringe religious groups. By the time of the Revolution he was living in hiding, likely from creditors. *

Captain Frédéric Rouille joined the Gardes Françaises in 1789, just in time to witness the beginning of the Revolution. As the son of a poor cobbler, Rouille had no hope of advancement into the aristocratic officer corps of the Gardes, and by the accounts of his contemporaries (Rouille himself left no letters or journals behind and may have been illiterate), the rhetoric of the Revolution found a true believer in him. When the bulk of the Gardes Françaises defected to the Garde nationale, Rouille was among them. He rose quickly through the ranks, unhindered by his lack of aristocratic breeding, and along with Santerre was one of the key figures in the storming of the Tuileries palace. *

"Roi des Thunes” (roughly “King of Beggars”) is a title claimed by various influential figures among the indigent population of Paris. The first written references to someone using that name date to the reign of Louis XIV, but it’s likely the term is much older. Some were benevolent spokespeople and organizers, others were ruthless extortionists and murderers.*

--<LF><LF>* But it’s fair to say that whoever they were, if they walked around called themselves the “King of Beggars” you could be pretty sure they were complete jackwagons.
--<LF><LF>Direct attestations are difficult to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggests that the man claiming the title in 1791 may have been the unacknowledged, illegitimate son of a minor nobleman who rose to a position of power in the Cour des Miracles district sometime in the late 1770s.<LF><LF>His fate remains unknown, but in an unpublished letter dated early February 1791, the Marquis de Sade remarked “the King is dead, and none of his miracles can now save him”. Since Louis XVI would not be executed for almost two more years, it’s suspected that this may refer to the Roi des Thunes.*

Born in New France sometime around 1740, Pierre Bellec joined the French colonial militia at the age of 16, at the start of the Seven Years’ War. He served with some distinction, earning a commendation for valor at the Battle of Fort Bull, but mustered out and traveled to France in 1762.*
<LF>--<LF>* As luck would have it, just barely missing a massive purge of the Colonial branch of the Brotherhood by the Templars.<LF><LF>Don’t worry. Those don’t happen any more. 

<LF>ell, hardly ever. <LF><LF>You know what, lock your doors. Just to be safe.<LF>--<LF><LF> He seems to have settled in Paris, judging from the numerous arrest records in his name over the next two decades. He may have been at the Bastille in 1789, but no conclusive proof naming him as one of the prisoners has ever surfaced. He died under peculiar circumstances in April of 1791; reportedly, his body was found “strangely garbed” in the Upper Chapel of the Sainte-Chapelle cathedral.**

<LF>-<LF>** To this day, the surest way to start a fight in a room full of Assassin Historians is to shout “Bellec was right!” Or, really, “Bellec was wrong!”

Ei<LF>her that or a kick to the shins. Many Assassin Historians have phenomenally weak shins.<LF>--

Marie Levesque was the daughter of nobility dating back to the 13th century.* By the time of the Revolution, the Levesques had fallen on hard times, and in an effort to bolster the family finances, Marie married Thomas Lobit, scion of a more recently-ennobled (and more prosperous) family, in 1771. (Marie’s father insisted that the groom take the bride’s surname, and the Lobits, eager for legitimacy, agreed.) Marie was, by all accounts, a fierce intellect and a sharp wit, and within a few years she had rebuilt the Levesque fortune.

<LF>-<LF>* The Levesques were staunch Templar traditionalists dating back almost to their founding. Bit surprising to see her show up as part of this New Templar business.<LF>--<LF><LF>During the Revolution, she deftly played both sides against each other, maintaining much of the lavish lifestyle to which she’d grown accustomed while avoiding the worst ire of the radicals. Much of her fortune was spent buying up as much grain as she could acquire and distributing it among the poor and the needy, and she gave generously toward the reformation of Paris’ prisons.**

<LF>-<LF>** AH HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA<LF>--<LF><LF>Tragically, she was murdered by an unknown assailant during the celebration of the Palais Royal’s conversion into a prison in late 1792.***

Louis-Michel Le Peletier

Id: [0x00088BC4]
Louis-Michel Le Peletier de Saint-Fargeau was born on May 29th, 1760, in Paris. Very promising, he became councillor of the Paris Parliament (before the Revolution, parliaments were judicial institutions and had no legislative function) in 1779; being under the age limit, he was admitted with special permission, most probably because of a Templar intercession. <LF><LF>Among other law-related activities, he climbed the ladder of that institution until 1789, when he was elected to the Estates General as a representative of the nobility. Pretty soon, he discarded his noble origins and supported the cause of the Third Estate. He then devoted himself to politics, even becoming for almost two weeks president of the National Constituent Assembly in June 1790. Being a lawyer, he took part in the writing of a draft of a criminal code, of which the most striking point is the abolition of the death penalty, but that idea is dismissed.<LF><LF>At the Convention, he nevertheless voted for the death of Louis XVI and was killed the very same evening. He also worked, more covertly, on a draft about education, which was read by Robespierre at the Convention about 6 months after Le Peletier's death.<LF><LF>Le Peletier's remains went to the Pantheon* and his daughter was adopted by the nation, as a token to his contribution to the Revolution.<LF><LF>--<LF>* Assassins 6, Templars 0<LF>--

Shaun here. <LF>Look, I just want to get this out of the way, because as soon anyone mentions the French Revolution, someone else’s eyes light up and they start going “Do you HEAR the people SING?” in that weird way people do when they’re both talking and singing at the same time, and then I have to listen to a GODAWFUL rendition of the song from that GODAWFUL musical and I seriously start to consider trapping my fingers in a door just so I have something else to think about.

Th<LF> French Revolution - the one you’re in - started in 1789. Have you got that?
<LF>es Misérables, the novel by Victor Hugo, later turned into a musical by someone who very clearly hates me personally and is dead-set on making my life a living breathing HELL, is set in Paris in the time period between 1815 and 1832… which was an ENTIRELY DIFFERENT revolution.

Hello. We haven’t met, but you can call me Shaun.
<LF>I just thought I’d say… it seems Abstergo has put together rather a lovely historical database that you can peruse as you’re running around. 

U<LF>fortunately for you, their historian gave things a bit of a… well, let’s just say they have a particular *viewpoint* they’re keen to get across.

B<LF> which I mean they’re Templars and they think like Templars, and they lie about people who aren’t Templars. 

<LF>o I’m just going to go through and add in some explanatory footnotes as I go to give you a bit more of a balanced perspective. 
<LF>Well, I’ll try for balance. I’ll aim for it. Balance is certainly something worth striving for. Or at least thinking about. Or maybe I’ll just mention it here and you can be your own judge.

A<LF>so – and far be it from me to criticize, because they’ve given it quite some effort – but the way they write this history is dry as a freeze-dried, dry-cleaned dry thing with a particularly chronic case of dry mouth. Which has been left out in the sun and then popped in the oven.

S<LF> let me at least attempt to make it that smidgen more readable.<LF><LF>Although that’s the last time I’ll ever use the word ‘smidgen’.

Different types of enemies have different strengths and weaknesses, and will require different tactics to overcome.

They have no special abilities or weakness.<LF><LF>Brutes are tough, strong enemies with a powerful melee attack that can't be parried. When you see one winding up, dodge.<LF><LF>Watchers are fast but frail enemies who prefer ranged weapons and are better at detecting you.<LF><LF>Seekers are quick, versatile enemies who use bombs and whose attacks cannot be Perfectly Parried. They can also break up groups of civilians, destroying your ability to Crowd Blend.<LF><LF>Defenders are slow, tough enemies who require a sustained series of focused attacks to wear down. They're most dangerous in a group, as they can absorb a great deal of punishments while their friends dish out damage.<LF><LF>Officers are the elite. They combine the abilities of all the other enemy types. They're best avoided.

Journal of Thomas de Carneillon, October 12, 1307

Id: [0x00091987]
It is done. All is in readiness, and there is naught left to do but wait for the coming of the dawn. Mentor Guillaume de Nogaret has bent the King’s will to ours, and with Benedict dead at Perugia, Rome is with us as well. And yet I find my heart gripped with sudden misgivings.
<LF>Dante and Domenico assure me that this is a great victory, that we will annihilate them root and branch... but I wonder. In breaking the Templars’ public façade, are we merely driving them into the shadows? Fifty years ago, the Templars thought us destroyed, after all. Vanishing from the public eye has proven our greatest strength in this interminable war—are we now granting the same boon to our enemies?

Report on the Recruitment of Mlle. La Maupin

Id: [0x00091989]
(This letter is written in a strong, flowing hand, in a calligraphic style popular near the end of the last century.)<LF><LF>The following are the words of Brother Assassin Louis-Joseph d'Albert de Luynes, Comte d’Albert, as set down by Master Assassin Maréchal, on account of the former being grievous wounded in his shoulder.

<LF>With further commentary by M. Maréchal, like so.)
<LF>On instruction of my Mentor, I set forth for Villeperdue on my steed, Argent. A fine stallion from good Andalusian stock...<LF><LF>(Brother d’Albert here digresses at length upon the virtues of his steed. Deeming this irrelevant to the business of the Brotherhood, I have excised it.)
<LF>My business was the identification and recruitment of a potential initiate, a swordsman and singer of some repute, a fellow by the name of “La Maupin.”

<LF>I told him she was a woman. The broadsheets announcing her fencing demonstrations proclaimed her a woman. Her name takes the feminine case. Brother d’Albert clearly needs to meditate upon the improvement of his senses.)
<LF>Much to my surprise, when I arrived at the tavern where I was to find the gentleman, what I found was instead plainly a young woman, fair of countenance and of hair, singing bawdy chansonettes and demonstrating swordplay for an admiring crowd. My brother Assassins and I approached her, whereupon I complimented her most highly upon her talents and inquired if we might speak. However, for reasons surpassing understanding, she became incensed at my words and threatened all three of us.<LF><LF>(From the testimony of Brother d’Albert’s comrades, his exact words were: “I’ve listened to your chirping, o pretty bird, now tell me of your plumage.”)

My <LF>rothers rushed nobly to my defense, but showed some not-ungentlemanly hesitation in striking a woman. I likewise attempted to talk her down, but taking my hesitation to shed blood as a sign of weakness, the mademoiselle struck me through the right shoulder so that her blade protruded six inches from my back. Doubtless shocked by the sight of blood, she fled the scene, while my brothers helped me to the village barber.<LF><LF>(The accounts of Brother d’Albert’s brothers tell a rather different story: that the young lady roundly trounced all three of them, struck Brother d’Albert a crippling blow, and then withdrew to the bar to order a cup of burgundy.)

B<LF>sed on this irrational and illogical reaction, I must conclude that Mlle. Maupin would be a poor choice for recruitment.<LF><LF>(And having tutored the mademoiselle personally in the arts of the stage, I must conclude that Brother d’Albert is a great ass and should no more be in charge of recruitments than an Orang Outan should be in charge of the crockery.)

Hérode et Mariamne Fails to Impress

Id: [0x0009198D]
(This clipping is from a newspaper dated 12 July, 1782. It is badly crumpled, as though someone once wadded it up into a small ball.)<LF><LF>A Theatrical Review by Mlle. Lecouvreur<LF><LF>Last evening I had the pleasure—if indeed pleasure it can be called—of seeing very nearly the worst production of Voltaire’s Hérode et Mariamne at Café Théâtre on Île St-Louis. Never has the tragic death of the Queen of Judea been rendered with more glaring ineptitude. M. Duprée’s Herod has all the pathos of a fishmonger who is especially ashamed of his day’s catch, and Mlle. Arcadie’s Mariamne seems able to do little more than wail like a child denied a treat. As to the supporting cast I shall only say that the director would have been better served by releasing a dozen Barbary apes into the theater. That at least might have incited the audience to a modicum of excitement.

As to th<LF> sets and the costuming, which should richly evoke the ancient world of Jerusalem, the director’s vision seems limited to papier-mâché temples and badly unconvincing false beards. Theater is a world of the imagination, to be sure, but this cheap, shoddy production resembles nothing so much as small children picking up sticks and proclaiming themselves “Mousquetieres de la Garde.” In short: I hated this play. I hated, hated, hated this play. If you, good readers, have any respect for M. Arouet’s work, I caution you to stay far, far away.

On the Plight of the Nobility

Id: [0x0009198F]
(This pamphlet is printed on the finest-quality paper and includes many fine woodcut illustrations.)<LF><LF>In these desperate times, we hear much of the plight of the Poor, but little of the plight of the Nobility.<LF><LF>Yet, why have we not? For the poor have always been poor–as such they have nothing more to lose, but we stand to lose all. We have been turned out of our homes, had our goods seized by mobs who claim to represent “the People”, we have been attacked in the streets, arrested, and even murdered simply for the crime of inheriting a title!

A<LF>d yet, without our wealth, where is France? For who will employ the poor if not for the rich? Who will employ the Pastry-maker if the king throws no party for him to cater? Who will employ a groundskeeper if not a Count with grounds to keep? Who, indeed, will employ even the lowliest of tanners without we of the nobility to buy their shockingly-priced goods? <LF><LF>No, there is no France without us! We of the Second Estate are the pillars which uphold our society! The very fact of this can be seen in the ways in which the Lower Classes have decided to express their displeasure. It began with their ignorance of protocol in attempting to continue the Estates General in a mere tennis court, without the blessing of their Rightful King but it did not end there. They have broken open armories and stolen weapons! They have marched upon Palaces and broken inside to threaten the king. They have threatened their betters in the street!<LF><LF>Is this angry mob really an effective way to govern a nation? I submit that it is not! Nobles of France, rise up and reclaim your titles! Call upon friends and family abroad to aid us in our time of peril! We must put an end to this revolution, for without us France is lost!

Cadet Rousselle

Id: [0x0009366C]
With lyrics written to the tune of an earlier French ditty, this playful satire rose to prominence after soldiers from the small town of Auxerre introduced it into the Armée du Nord. From here it shot to national attention and quickly became an international classic, spawning English and Russian versions. The Cadet Rousselle at the center of the song was based on a real individual, Guillaume Rousselle, a beloved local bailiff who lived and worked in Auxerre for many decades, and who had earned a reputation as something of an eccentric bon vivant with an ostentatious house and questionable personal taste. The lyrics of the song playfully contrast his showiness with his shabbier qualities, resulting in a delightful portrait of a strange but harmless man. Each verse opens with a declaration of the cadet’s various qualities and belongings, almost always grouping them in threes – “trois maisons” (three houses), “trois chapeaux” (three hats), “trois garçons” (three sons) – before going on to describe them in bizarre terms. Each verse then ends with a cheer celebrating a sincere, if slightly patronizing affection for the old chap:

Ah! Ah! <LF>h! mais vraiment,<LF>Cadet Rousselle est bon enfant.<LF><LF>Ah! Ah! Ah! But truly,<LF>Cadet Rousselle is a good kid!

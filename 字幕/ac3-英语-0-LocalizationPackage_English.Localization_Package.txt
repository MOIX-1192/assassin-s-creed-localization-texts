Don’t confuse this place with the Old North Church – it’s actually a completely different building, which is why it has a different name. This particular meeting house was for the second oldest congregation in Boston, which earned it the alternate name "The Second Church". What an age of endless imagination this was. <br><br>Get a good look while you can – this wooden building will be torn down in 1776 and used as firewood. The church members would tell you it was because the British didn’t like them much – and perhaps they have a point, because they still don’t.  The Reverend, Mr. Lathrop, was known for his pro-Rebel sermons and tellingly, he and most of his congregation weren’t in Boston in 1776. I wonder why. After the Old North Meeting House was torn down, Christ Church inherited the prestigious ‘Old North’ title, becoming the “Old North Church” that most people know.

KING'S CHAPEL

Id: [0x00058211]
King James II ordered the building of this Anglican Church in the 1680s, because he was a King, and a perk of the job is doing whatever they want. However, since Boston was full of Puritans who had come to the New World precisely to get away from the Anglicans, nobody was willing to sell land to the budding parish. <br><br>In the end, the governor ordered that the church be built on top of the old public burial ground, the logic being that the dead couldn't complain – they’re notoriously compliant. And there the church stands today. <br><br>After the revolution, the church was known as “The Stone Chapel” for several years – Kings not being particularly popular at the time, and calling a stone chapel “The Stone Chapel” was the best idea anyone could come up with at the time.<br><br>(I’ve never understood these people’s need for independence, by the way. We gave birth to them, they were happy to suckle on our teats in their infancy, there were a few toddler wobbles but as soon as they got to their teenage years all they could bang on about was their independence. So they stormed out, but we know they’ll be back eventually to borrow money or to get us to wash their clothes, and we’ll forgive them, because we are older and wiser.)

Id: [0x00058212]
CHRIST CHURCH

Id: [0x00058213]
This is known today as "Old North Church", because it's the oldest church in the North End of Boston, but up to 1776 it would have been known by its official name, Christ Church, named after Jesus Christ, a former celebrity carpenter. <br><br>This is where, on the night of Paul Revere's ride, two signal lanterns appeared to warn rebels on the opposite shore that the British Regulars were on their way to seize weapons.  The signal was Paul Revere's idea, but contrary to popular belief the lamps weren't a signal sent to Revere. They were meant to warn lookouts on the opposite shore in case Revere was captured. <br><br>This church was a natural choice for a signal flame: it was the highest steeple in Boston and easily seen from the other side of the river.  Even better, the church was Anglican - the congregation was full of wealthy Loyalists. Who would suspect the church sexton (Robert Newman, a friend of Revere's) of sneaking into the church at night to send secret messages?<br><br>Well, the British would, actually. They captured Newman a few days later and questioned him. He put on a terrific show, and managed to convince them he was innocent - and then fled town, which didn’t really back up the whole ‘innocent’ thing very well at all.

OLD SOUTH MEETING HOUSE

Id: [0x00058215]
This building hosted some of the key events in the American Revolution, mostly by accident. It just happened to be one of the largest buildings in Boston. So, when meetings at Faneuil Hall overflowed, everyone moved to the Old South Meeting House to continue.  This meant the biggest, angriest, most rebellious crowds ended up here.<br><br>After the Boston Massacre, the people met here to demand that the Governor remove British troops from the city - which he did. Thousands showed up here for meetings leading up to the Boston Tea Party. On the night of the tea party itself, this was where Samuel Adams delivered the line "This meeting can do nothing more to save the country", giving the go-ahead to seize the boats and dump the tea. Is anything a bigger slap in the face to a Brit than dumping tea? No. Well, apart from just slapping us in the face, but that’s a secret I wish I hadn’t told you.<br><br>Of course, during the British siege in 1776, this church met the same fate as other rebel hotspots: it was ransacked.  The pews and pulpit were torn out and used as firewood, and the interior was filled with dirt and used as a stable and riding school. There was even a bar on the second level. I guess the troops thought that would really stick it to the Puritans. The only thing worse would have been a karaoke night. Puritans hate karaoke.

Id: [0x00058216]
NEW SOUTH MEETING HOUSE

Id: [0x00058217]
Another wooden church, this time with a bell in the steeple. Samuel Adams' father (Also named Samuel Adams) was one of the founding members.  I'm surprised it wasn't torn down for firewood during the siege, but I guess its members just hadn't angered the British enough for that.<br><br>It's conveniently named so you won't mistake it for the Old South Meeting house, where all the important events happened. Simple is best. <br><br>(I’m describing the naming system – I’m not describing you.)

Id: [0x00058218]
OLD MEETING HOUSE

Id: [0x00058219]
The bells in this church rang out in the hours leading up to the Boston Massacre, as crowds were gathering to taunt the soldiers in front of the State House. In Boston at the time, church bells were rung when there was a fire, so people ran into the streets to see what was happening. That swelled the crowd, making tensions between the people and the British soldiers that much worse.  It ended, of course, with the soldiers firing into the crowd, killing 5 people.<br><br>And this concludes our lesson on how church bells could be used to incite riots in Colonial America.

GREEN DRAGON TAVERN

Id: [0x0005821B]
This tavern is sometimes called the "Headquarters of the Revolution", though I imagine when it is, they pronounce it “Headquartersh of the Revolushun”, because overthrowing the government in a pub is thirsty work.<br><br>It was a popular place for people like Paul Revere and Samuel Adams to sit with their friends and plot.<br><br>Up until 1754, the tavern was owned by William Douglass. When he died, his property was left to his daughter, Catherine Kerr, and his nephew, Cornelius Douglass. They divided their inheritance equally - and it seems, got along famously.<br><br>The Freemasons bought the tavern in 1766 and renamed it "The Freemasons Arms", which didn't actually stick because the sign above the door was still a Green Dragon. (Freemasons: the secret society everyone knows about. “Let’s get a pub where we can meet in complete secret and no one will ever know!” – “Brilliant! What shall we call it?” – “How about the Freemasons Arms?”) <br><br>Legend has it that Paul Revere's ride was planned here, but that's unlikely. By 1774 Revere had been warned that the British were listening in on his meetings and had therefore stopped making Super Secret Plans in public where anyone could hear them.<br><br>Someone tell the Masons. You know where to find them.

Id: [0x0005821C]
CROWN COFFEE HOUSE

Id: [0x0005821D]
The name of this place is somewhat misleading. It's likely that this 'coffee house' sold more wine than coffee, since coffee was only just becoming popular. I know it's hard to imagine a time when people didn't enjoy their morning cup, but there you are.<br><br>If we go by the number of bottles they had in stock, this was one of the busiest taverns in Boston - likely because of its location. If you were arriving in Boston by ship in the 1700s – and let’s face it, you didn’t fly in - this would have been the first tavern you saw, and since taverns were great places to get information, you might well have stopped here for a drink and the latest news.

Id: [0x0005821E]
BUNCH OF GRAPES

Id: [0x0005821F]
This was one of the meeting places of the Sons of Liberty. The attraction of this particular tavern may have been the library, which included many anti-British books. Or it might have been its reputation as the finest punch-house in Boston. Or it might even have been its location, which is right down the street from the Old State House, where the legislature met (and where the Boston Massacre occurred). Or it might have been Darts Night.<br><br>While I'd love to use the fact that the Patriots met in taverns to imply all kinds of things about them, I should point out that taverns were places to do business as well as drink, and that alcohol was viewed as (more or less) the cure for all ills.  (You're waiting for a punch line, but that's actually true. Those are the kind of doctor’s orders I crave.)

Id: [0x00058220]
OLD STATE HOUSE

Id: [0x00058221]
This building housed the Massachusetts government from 1713 to 1798. Before the revolution, that would have meant the governor, his advisors, and the elected assembly. Of course, by 'elected', I mean 'elected by white male property-owners' since they were the only people that had the right to vote.<br><br> The assembly also had rather limited power - the governor had a veto over anything they decided, and on occasion dissolved the assembly when they didn't vote his way. Less a governor, more a dictator.<br><br>In 1767 a gallery was installed above the meeting floor here so the general public could watch their legislature at work - this was a very novel idea at the time. Of course, some of the representatives probably regretted the decision later, when crowds used the area to heckle those who voted pro-British. Then again, perhaps that was the point all along.<br><br>The government moved out of the building to a bigger space in 1798 and the old building was turned over to merchants, including a wine seller and a wig-maker, making it the colonial equivalent of a shopping mall, though one that mainly dealt in wine and wigs.

Id: [0x00058222]
FANEUIL HALL

Id: [0x00058223]
Don't let the French spelling confuse you. The name of this building is pronounced "Fan-yul or "Fannel". Getting it wrong is a good way to indicate you're not from around here, but it’s also a great way of proving you’re not French, which in my experience is a real boon.<br>  <br>Also, if you want to pass as a local, you should take a good look at the weathervane. It's a Boston landmark. Legend has it that in the war of 1812, suspected spies were asked what was on top of Faneuil Hall. Only a true local would be able to say it was a grasshopper.<br><br>The building was named after Peter Faneuil, the local merchant who paid to build it. It was meant as a place for local farmers to sell their goods so their carts would stop crowding the streets, and also so you didn’t have to walk near farmers.<br><br>However, it's the meeting hall on the second floor, which gives the building its nickname "The Cradle of Liberty". That's rather ostentatious - and dare I say, American - as a nickname, but it's not inaccurate. People met here to protest the Stamp Act. The first anti-tea tax meetings were also held here. Anti-British meetings occasionally drew crowds so large the building couldn't even hold them (at which point they all went to the Old South Meeting Hall).<br><br>During the siege of Boston, the meeting hall here was made over into a theatre. Since plays of any kind were banned in Boston under ordinary circumstances – something I think should still be a law, actually - this is yet another example of the British Loyalists sticking it to the rebels.

Id: [0x00058224]
PAUL REVERE HOUSE

Id: [0x00058225]
Paul Revere lived in this house with his family from 1770 until about 1800, with some notable exceptions (such as when he had to lie low because he'd warned the countryside of the British march on Lexington and Concord.) <br><br>What with the shortage of firewood in 1776, and the Loyalist insistence on getting back at anyone who'd defied them in the past, you'd think this wooden house might have been torn down too, but it wasn't. This might be because Revere left his eldest son (also named Paul) in town to watch over the estate. <br><br>In any event, the building is still around today- one of Revere's descendants bought it in 1905 and turned it into a museum. It's now the oldest building in Boston - in fact, it was already 90 years old when Revere bought it. Colonial architecture is apparently superior to that of your average McMansion.

OLD CORNER BOOK STORE

Id: [0x00058227]
It's an apothecary shop at the moment, but in a few decades this building will be home to Ticknor and Fields, the leading American publisher of their day. That might sound a bit dull, but this building will be at the centre of American literature and thinking. Authors like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne Harriet Beecher Stowe, even Charles Dickens will all meet here.<br><br>Of course, given the state of American education, it's possible you don't know who any of those people are. I could have said Minty Clitheroe and Pippy BoomBoom and you’d still have looked impressed.

MILL POND

Id: [0x00058229]
This is the site of Boston's first - and for a good while, only - flour mill. The Mill owners closed this pond off from the Charles River, leaving only a small stream that led to the ocean. Twice a day, the tides in Boston Harbour would fill the stream, powering the mill.<br><br>Of course, closing the pond off also made it stagnant. Since water was used as a dumping ground for sewage, garbage and dead animals, it was quite dirty and frankly, stank. <br><br>Around the turn of the century the city decided that something needed to be done. Rather than re-open the causeway and clean out the pond, developers decided they could make room for houses (and also more money) by filling it in with land taken from the top of Beacon Hill. So, that's exactly what they did. Building homes on sewage since the turn of the century! What a wonderful slogan that would have made.

Id: [0x0005822A]
BEACON HILL

Id: [0x0005822B]
Perhaps predictably, Beacon Hill gets its name because the Puritan settlers placed a beacon on the hilltop. 'Beacon' here essentially meant 'a bucket full of pitch hanging from a pole'. The idea being it could be lit to warn the countryside if the town was attacked - simple, effective, and never actually used. <br><br>The hill is shorter today than it used to be - the top of it was carted off to fill in Mill Pond. This had the advantage of making the hilltop easier to build on, and creating more land at Mill Pond - a 2-for-1 deal for developers.<br><br>Beacon Hill became THE place to live in Boston after the new Massachusetts State House opened here in 1790. Developers created upscale housing on the south side of the hill, which overlooks the Boston Common.  <br><br>The North side of the hill had been settled earlier, and was much less posh, sometimes going by the evocative nickname of 'Mount Whoredom'. What a magical address. George Washington, ever the politician, would refer to it in one of his letters as "Mount Horam" - though that sounds more like an instruction than a place.

Id: [0x0005822C]
BOSTON LIGHT

Id: [0x0005822D]
This was the first lighthouse in North America, built to help guide ships into Boston harbour at night. Of course, this made it a prime target for the revolutionaries during the siege of Boston. They attacked and burned the building. When the British began to repair it, they returned and burned it again.<br><br>Of course, the British did them one better - when they left Boston harbour in 1776, they blew up the entire lighthouse behind them. It was a very confusing time to be a lighthouse fan. Do I like them? Don’t I like them? I felt the same way about light jazz.<br><br>A new lighthouse was built in 1783, so it persists and survives, despite all efforts to destroy it. <br><br>Much like light jazz.

MACNEAL'S ROPE YARD

Id: [0x0005822F]
These buildings were used to make rope for ship rigging. Please try and stay awake. Ships at the time needed a surprising amount of rope - up to 20 miles of the stuff each, which you’ll realize is incredible, if you're a rope nerd.<br><br>Ahem. <br><br>This’ll wake you up. Rope isn't the real reason this place is well-known (among historians, I mean.) In March of 1770, one of the workers here asked a passing British soldier if he wanted a job, then told him to "go clean my shithouse". The soldier was so offended that he started a fight. Then he left, came back with several of his friends and started a full-on brawl.  That one insult led to days of fighting between soldiers and rope workers - leading right up to the Boston Massacre.<br><br>The relationship between the British and Bostonians at the time was... a little tense, to say the least. History does not reveal if that worker ever had his shithouse cleaned, but it seems unlikely.

Id: [0x00058230]
BOSTON COMMON

Id: [0x00058231]
This has the honour of being the first public park in North America. It started off as the pasture of William Blackstone (or Blaxton, if you prefer the original spelling), who despite his name was the first white settler in this area. When Boston started growing, Blackstone decided to move somewhere more remote. He sold the land to the growing city for £30, and they turned it into common land - hence the name.<br><br>For the first century or two of Boston's history this was a place to pasture your cows (no more than 70 at a time), drill soldiers (the British Regulars camped here) attend the occasional public hanging (for offenses such as being a witch, or being a Quaker), or perhaps simply take a nice walk… near all the cows and hanging.<br><br>The British left the camp when the fled the city in 1776. Public hangings ended in 1817. The cows were banned in 1830. You can still take a walk here, however, but what’s the point, without the cows?

Id: [0x00058232]
LIBERTY TREE

Id: [0x00058233]
The first protest over the Stamp Act met under this tree in August of 1765.  Shortly afterward, a plaque was nailed to the tree calling it the "Liberty Tree". Some say the name was meant to discourage violence from the crowds that met here, but that would be like naming a battlefield HappyGlade Smile-Farm and just crossing your fingers. Eventually, a flag pole was installed in the tree, and the flag flown to summon people to meetings.<br><br>Unpopular figures were hung in effigy from the tree's branches. The Sons of Liberty also used to issue "Summons" to the tree for supposed crimes (i.e. supporting unpopular British decrees, like the Stamp Act and Tea Act). <br><br>The idea caught on elsewhere - other towns designated their own liberty trees, or put up liberty poles. In New York there was an ongoing battle between the Sons of Liberty - who kept putting the poles up - and the British Authority - who kept taking them down, like an angry couple who can’t decide whether the toilet seat should be up or down.<br><br>True to the British penchant for destroying anything the Rebels loved, soldiers and Loyalists chopped down this tree during the siege in 1775. It was used as firewood, which was in short supply. Modern Day Boston has a plaque over the tree's former location, but the tree itself has never been replaced. So much for environmental sustainability.

Stephane Chapheau

Id: [0x0005A14A]
Stephane Chapheau is a Boston militiaman, and served as a cook in the years leading up to the revolution.<br><br>Chapheau was born in what's now Canada - near modern-day Montreal. His father was a cook for the French army who was killed in the fighting at the Plains of Abraham. After his death, Chapheau took on work as a chef in Montreal, but moved to Boston in 1764. While his personal letters indicate he was looking for a less complicated life, he was just in time for the unrest that preceded the Revolution. Fortunately for Chapheau, he didn't actually want a quiet life - and as it happened, the tensions in pre-Revolution Boston suited him exactly. Which is weird, because who enjoys tensions? Apart from a scientist studying surface tension as an effect of intermolecular attraction!!!<br><br>Give me a minute to stop laughing.<br><br>Chapheau was a man in search of a cause, and he found it in the Patriots. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Sons of Liberty - participating in their 1765 protests surrounding the Stamp Act. He was present when the crowds ransacked Governor Hutchinson's house in 1765 - probably egging on the mob. He was also one of the crowd that witnessed (and partially caused) the Boston Massacre. <br><br>Chapheau didn't limit himself to protests. I have several fines for him on the books in the 1760s and 70s for public drunkenness, and brawling - it seems he couldn't keep out of a fight when the opportunity arose - and in pre-revolution Boston, there was always an opportunity. It was a wonderful time to be an angry drunk – the world was your oyster.

Duncan Little

Id: [0x0005A14C]
Duncan Little was originally from Ireland, the youngest son of a large family, which is confusing, seeing as they were the Little family. He entered the priesthood at a young age, and was sent to Africa as a missionary in 1756.<br><br>Little spent several years in Africa, but in 1760 he returned to Ireland, leaving the priesthood entirely - I'd tell you why, but it seems that information is locked behind a wall at the Vatican and I'm not hacking into their records today as they seem to have changed their password from W3L0V3P0P3 again. The next information I have about him is as a passenger on a ship to Boston in 1763. From his letters, it seems his family more or less drove him away over his split with the Catholic Church. (Blood being thicker than water and all of that.) <br><br>Little settled in Boston's North End, where he gained a reputation as a mediator - more fair and less expensive than going before the local judiciary. When he wasn't spending time at the local pub, he was helping people to solve their problems - generally by talking them down from a fight, which seems to be all that really happened in Boston in those days. And by those days, I mean anything up to the present day.  Little was the first person people called when there was a scuffle, and his usual table at the King's Horse tavern was known locally as "Little's Court" - a moniker the British cracked down on in 1770. Because we like to ruin everyone's fun.

Clipper Wilkinson

Id: [0x0005A14E]
Clipper Wilkinson is a hunter and surveyor from Virginia. Actually, surveying and hunting are the family business. His father and brother are surveyors (and crack shots) as well - making the market in his small hometown somewhat oversaturated. Hell, making the market in his HOUSE somewhat oversaturated.<br><br>Wilkinson moved to New York looking for work - unfortunately arriving just in time for the opening events of the Revolution. He remained neutral for the first part of the war, but after seeing the cruelty of the Redcoats' actions in Boston, he started leaning toward the rebel side - putting himself at odds with the rest of his family, who are Loyalists.<br><br>It seems Connor has a talent for attracting friends with family troubles.

Deborah 'Dobby' Carter

Id: [0x0005A150]
Deborah Carter was a courier in New York City at the time of the Revolution. She's the daughter of a merchant, Amos Carter, who was locally known for owning and bankrupting numerous businesses, and racking up significant debts.<br><br>Deborah was turned onto the streets at the age of 10 and took up work as an errand-runner, disguising herself as a boy to do it (hence the nickname 'Dobby'). Many of the tradesmen she worked for knew who she really was, but pretended to be fooled by the disguise. Possibly at first because they understood that her other options were limited, but later because she was quick, reliable and intelligent. <br><br>As a teenager, "Dobby" had to drop her disguise - but she kept her nickname. She continued her career carrying messages - and began negotiating contracts between businesses. She became something of a community icon - making sure the poor in the neighbourhood had food and clothing, and fighting against merchants who were charging exorbitant prices for staple items – a bit like Robin Hood, though when Dobby wore tights, no one giggled. And it was as a community icon that she met Connor.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm not being completely figurative when I say she was 'fighting' merchants. She wasn't averse to throwing a punch or two when it was necessary, particularly in her own defense - or the defense of others in her neighbourhood.

Jacob Zenger

Id: [0x0005A152]
Jacob Zenger was born near the town of Mannheim, in what is today Southwestern Germany.  He's the son of a farmer, one of 13 siblings. (Seems like a lot by modern standards, but colonial families were large, and the sad truth is that only 4 of Jacob's brothers and sisters would survive to adulthood.)<br><br>Zenger's family was poor and his career prospects were limited in Mannheim. Following the promise of a better life, he signed up as a soldier.  After several years in the service, he was shipped to New York - one of the Hessians sent to fight for the British in the Revolution. <br><br> Zenger - like many of the Hessian troops - left the service after coming overseas. Eager to get back to the country, Zenger bought a plot of land and left New York. However, after a series of crop failures, he was forced to move back to the city, taking up the only career that he could find to pay the bills - working as a bodyguard.

Jamie Colley

Id: [0x0005A154]
Jamie Colley is the son of a New York dock worker - James Colley. History doesn't record the name of his mother, though the Assassin records note she worked on a plantation in the southern colonies. <br><br>As a boy, Colley spent 3 years as a student at the Trinity School, where he was reported to be a bright student, reading everything he could get his hands on - his instructors noted that he was destined for great things. (I know you're wondering: yes, your school's permanent record really is that permanent). However, after that brief period he disappears from the school's attendance rolls - my guess would be he left because he needed to start earning money.  <br><br>It seems Colley's prospects didn't much improve through his teenage years - I have records of him being fined for vagrancy several times, which is never the sign of a high-flier. After that, he worked doing odd jobs for various local businesses, finally ending up working for a local physician, where his intelligence was recognized as an asset. He worked for several years as the doctor's assistant, where he met Connor.

Courteous Reader,<br><br>I might in this place attempt to gain thy Favour, by declaring that I write Almanacks with no other View than that of the publick Good; but in this I should not be sincere; and Men are now adays too wise to be deceiv’d by Pretences how specious foever.  The plain Truth of the Matter is, I am excessive ppor, and my Wife, good Woman, is, I tell her, excessive proud; she cannot bear, she says, to sit spinning in her Shift of Tow, while I do nothing but gaze at the Stars ; and has threatned more than once to burn all my Books and Rattling-Traps (as she calls my Instruments) if I do not make some profitable Use of them for the good of my Family.  The Printer has offer’d me some considerable share of the Profits, and I have thus begun to comply with my Dame’s desire.<br><br>Indeed this Motive would have had Force enough to have made me publish an Almanack many Years since, had it not been overpower’d by my Regard for my good Friend and Fellow-Student, Mr. Titan Leeds, whose Interest I was extreamly unwilling to hurt: But this Obstacle (I am far from speaking it with Pleasure) is soon to be removed, since inexorable Death, who was never known to respect Merit, has already prepared the mortal Dart, the fatal Sister has already extended her destroying Shears, and that ingenious Man must soon be taken from us.  He dies, by my Calculation made at his Request, on Oct. 17. 1733. 3ho. 29m. P.M. at the very instant of the Conjunction of Sol and Mercury; By his own Calculation he will survive till the 26th of the same Month. This small difference between us we have disputed whenever we have met these 9 Years past; but at length he is inclinable to agree with my Judgment; Which of us is most exact, a little Time will now determine.  As therefore these Provinces may not longer expect to see any of his Performances after this year, I think my self free to take up the Tas, and request a share of the publick Encouragement; which I am the more apt to hope for on this Account that the Buyer of y Almanack may consider himself, not only as purchasing an useful Utensilf, but as performing an Act of Charity, to his poor Friend and Servant<br>R SAUNDERS<br><br>XI Mon.

Id: [0x00064BFB]
Loving Readers, <br><br>Your kind acceptance of my former labours has encouraged me to continue writing, tho' the general approbation you have been so good as to favour me with, has excited the envy of some, and drawn upon me the malice of others. These illwillers of mine, despited at the great reputation I gain'd by exactly predicting another man's death, have endeavoured to deprive me of it all at once in the most effectual manner, by reporting that I myself was never alive. They say, in short, that there is no such a man as I am; and have spread this notion so thoroughly in the country, that I have been frequently told it to my face by those that don't know me. This is not civil treatment, to endeavour to deprive me of my very being, and reduce me to a non-entity in the opinion of the publick. But so long as I know myself to walk about, eat, drink and sleep, I am satisfied that there is really such a man as l am, whatever they may say to the contrary. And the world may be satisfied likewise, for if there was no such man as I am, how is it possible I should appear publickly to hundreds of people, as I have done for several years past, in print? I need not, indeed, have taken any notice of so idle a report, if it had not been for the sake of my printer, to whom my enemies are pleased to ascribe my productions; and who it seems is as unwillingly to father my offspring as I am to lose the credit of it. Therefore, to clear him entirely, as well as to vindicate my own honour, I make this publick and serious declaration, which I desire may be believed, to wit: That what I have written heretofore, and do now write, <br>neither was, nor is written by any other man or men, per son or persons, whatsoever. <br>Those who are not satisfied with this, must needs be very unreasonable. <br><br>My performance for this year follows; it submits itself, kind reader, to thy censure, but hopes (for) thy candor, to forgive its faults. It devotes itself entirely to thy service, and will serve thee faithfully. And if it has the good fortune to please its master, 'tis gratification enough for the labour of <br>Poor<br>R. SAUNDERS<br><br>Presumptuous man! the reason would'st thou find <br>Why formed so weak, so little, and so blind? <br>First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess, <br>Why formed no weaker, blinder, and no less? <br>Ask of thy Mother Earth, why Oaks are made <br>Taller or stronger than the Weeds they shade? <br>Or ask of yonder argent Fields above, <br>Why Jove's Sattelites are less than Jove? <br><br>XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.<br><br>Some have learn't many Tricks of sly Evasion, <br>Instead of Truth they use Equivocation, <br>And eke it out with mental Reservation, <br>Which to good Men is an Abomination. <br>Our Smith of late most wonderfully swore, <br>That whilst he breathed he would drink no more,;<br>But since, I know his Meaning, for I think <br>He meant he would not breathe whilst he did drink <br><br>He is no clown that drives the plow, but he that doth clownish things. <br>If you know how to spend less than you get, you have the philosopher's-stone <br>The good pay-master is lord of another man's purse <br>Fish and visiters smell in three days. <br><br>XII Mon. February hath xxix days.<br><br>Sam's wife provok'd him once; he broke her Crown, <br>The surgeon's Bill amounted to Five Pounds; <br>This Blow (she brags) has cost my Husband dear, <br>He'll ne'er strike more, Sam chanc'd to overhear. <br>Therefore, before his Wife the Bill he pays, <br>And to the surgeon in her hearing, says: <br>Doctor, you charge Five pound, here e'en take Ten, <br>My Wife may chance to want your Help again. <br><br>He that has neither fools nor beggars among his kindred, is the son of thunder-gust. <br>Diligence is the mother of good luck. <br>Do not do that which you would not have known. <br><br>I Mon. March hath xxxi days.<br><br>Whate'er's desired, Knowledge, Fame, or Pelf, <br>Not one will change his Neighbour with himself ; <br>The learn'd are happy Nature to explore, <br>The Fool is happy that he knows no more. <br>The Rich are happy in the Plenty given ; <br>The Poor contents him with the Care of Heav’n. <br>Thus does some Comfort ev'ry State attend, <br>And Pride's bestowed on all, a common Friend. <br><br>Never praise your Cyder or Horse, or Bedfellow<br>Wealth is not his that has it, but his that enjoys it. <br>'Tis easy to see, hard to foresee. <br>In a discreet man's mouth a publick thing is private. <br><br>II Mon. April hath xxx days<br><br>By nought is Man from Beast distinguished, <br>More than by Knowledge in his learned Head, <br>Then Youth improve thy Time, but cautious see <br>That what thou learnest somehow useful be; <br>Each Day improving, Solon waxed old; <br>For Time he knew was better far than Gold: <br>Fortune might give him Gold which would decay, <br>But Fortune cannot give him — Yesterday. <br><br>Let thy maid-servant be faithful, strong, and homely. <br>Keep flax from fire, youth from gaming. <br>Bargaining has neither friends nor relations. <br>Admiration is the daughter of ignorance. <br>There's more old drunkards, than old doctors. <br><br>III Mon. May hath xxxi days.<br><br>Lalus who loves to hear himself discourse, <br>Keeps talking still as if he frantick were, <br>And tho' himself might no where hear a worse, <br>Yet he no other but himself will hear. <br>Stop not his Mouth, if he be troublesome, <br>But stop his Ears, and then the Man is dumb. <br><br>Here comes Courage! that seiz’d the lion absent, and run away from the present mouse. <br>He that takes a wife takes care. <br>Nor Eye in a letter, nor Hand in a purse, nor Ear in the secret of another. <br>He that buys by the penny, maintains not only himself, but other people. <br><br>IV Mon.

Adieu.<br><br>In my last year's Almanack, I mentioned that the visible Eclipses of this year 1736, portended some great and surprising events relating to these Northern colonies, of which I proposed this year to speak at large. But as those Events are not to happen immediately this Year, I chuse rather, upon second Thought, to defer farther Mention of them, till the Publication of my Almanack for that Year in which they are to happen. However, that the Reader may not be entirely disappointed, here follow, for his present Amusement, a few <br><br>ENIGMATICAL PROPHECIES,<br><br>Which they that do not understand, cannot well explain. <br> 1. Before the middle of this Year, a Wind at N. East will arise, during which the Water of the Sea and Rivers will be in such a manner raised, that great part of the Towns of Boston, Newport, New-York, Philadelphia, the low Lands of Maryland and Virginia, and the Town of Charleston in South Carolina will be under water. Happy will it be for the sugar and salt, standing in the Cellars of those Places, if there be tight Roofs and Cielings overhead ; otherwise without being a Conjurer, a man may easily foretel that such Commodities will receive Damage. <br> 2. About the middle of the Year, great Numbers of Vessels fully laden, will be taken out of the Ports aforesaid, by a Power with which we are not now at War, and whose Forces shall not be descried or seen, either coming or going. But in the End this may not be disadvantageous to those Places. <br> 3. However, not long after, a visible Army of 20,000 Musketers will land, some in Virginia & Maryland, and some in the lower Counties on both sides of Delaware, who will over-run the Country, and sorely annoy the Inhabitants : But the Air in this Climate will agree with them so ill towards Winter, that they will die in the beginning of cold Weather like rotten Sheep, and by Christmas the Inhabitants will get the better of them. <br><br>Note, — In my next Almanack these Enigmatical Prophecies will be explained.

PREFACE.<br><br>Courteous and kind Reader, <br><br>This is the fifth time I have appeared in publick, chalking out the future year for my honest countrymen, and foretelling what shall, and what may, and what may not come to pass ; in which I have the pleasure to find that I have given general satisfaction. Indeed, among the multitude of our astrological predictions, 'tis no wonder if some few fail; for, without any defect in the art itself, 'tis well known that a small error, a single wrong figure overseen in a calculation, may occasion great mistakes: But, however, we Almanack-makers may miss it in other things, I believe it will generally be allowed that we always hit the day of the month, and that I suppose is esteem'd one of the most useful things in an Almanack. <br><br>As to the weather, if I was to fall into the method my brother J--n sometimes uses, and tell you, Snow here, or in New-England, — Rain here, or in South Carolina, — Cold to the northward, — Warm to the southward, and the like, whatever errors I might commit, I should be something more secure of not being detected in them: But I consider it will be of no service to any body to know what weather it is 1000 miles off, and therefore I always set down positively what weather my reader will have, be he where he will at the time. "We modestly desire only the favourable allowance of a day or two before, and a day or two after the precise day against which the weather is set ; — and if it does not come to pass accordingly, let the fault be laid upon the printer, who, 'tis very like, may have transposed or misplac'd it, perhaps for the conveniency of putting in his holidays: and since, in spight of all I can say, people will give him great part of the credit of making my Almanacks, 'tis but reasonable he should take some share of the blame. <br><br>I must not here omit to thank the publick for the gracious and kind encouragement they have hitherto given me: — But if the generous purchaser of my labours could see how often his Fi'pence helps to fight up the comfortable fire, line the pot, fill the cup and make glad the heart of a poor man, and an honest good old woman, he would not think his money ill laid out, though the Almanack of his friend and servant, <br><br>R. SAUNDERS, <br>Were one half blank paper.<br><br>RATTLE-SNAKE HERB.<br><br>The Indians long made a secret of the herb they used in curing the bite of that venomous reptile a Rattlesnake; I hope it will be an acceptable service to these parts of the world, if I make it publick by the following description, with the figure of a leaf of it. <br><br>The top and branches of the plant, are thick set with small yellow flowers in August and September. It is a species of Golden-Rod, known from the other sorts by the smoothness <br>of the leaf, and its pungent taste, and occasioning when chewed and swallow'd, a small stoppage of the breath, and contraction in the throat ; and the stalk which is in some places less than a yard in height when at full growth, in others more, is of a dull purple colour, and smooth, and cover'd with a fine blue dust, like that on many of the English plums. It grows in most woodlands, but under the shade of trees is seldom rank or large, or with more than one, two, or three stalks. It is also found on the banks of dry ditches, and sometimes in them and in hedge-rows. But it is most luxuriant near to run-sides, if the soil be rich, and not too moist, nor too much shaded. The root continues over the winter, and if set in a good garden, will send forth (in the 2d or 3d year,) at least 50 stalks. <br><br> The Indians use it variously ; sometimes they bruise it between stones, and sometimes chew it and spit in the patient's mouth, some lay it to the wound, others about the wound, sometimes they boil it and give the water to drink, washing the wound with it likewise ; but always some of it is to be swallowed, either with the spittle or with water.<br><br>HINTS for those that would be Rich.<br><br>The use of money is all the advantage there is in having money. <br>For 6£ a year you may have use of 100£, if you are a man of known prudence <br>and honesty. <br>He that spends a groat a-day idly, spends idly above 6£ a year, which is the <br>price of using 100£. <br>He that wastes idly a groat's worth of his time per day, one day with another, <br>wastes the privilege of using 100£ each day. <br>He that idly loses 5s. worth of time, loses 5s., and might as prudently throw <br>5 s. into the river. <br>He that loses 5s. not only loses that sum, but all the other advantage that might be made by turning it in dealing, which, by the time a young man becomes old, amounts to a comfortable bag of money. <br>Again, He that sells upon credit, asks a price for what he sells equivalent to the principal and interest of his money for the time he is like to be kept out of it ; — therefore, <br>He that buys upon credit pays interest for what he buys, <br>And he that pays ready money, might let that money out to use; so that <br>He that possesses anything he has bought, pays interest for the use of it. <br>Consider then, when you are tempted to buy any unnecessary household stuff, or any superfluous thing, whether you will be willing to pay interest, and interest upon interest for it as long as you live, and more if it grows worse by using. <br>Yet, in buying goods, 'tis best to pay ready money, because, <br>He that sells upon credit, expects to lose 5 per cent, by bad debts ; therefore he charges on all he sells upon credit, an advance that shall make up that deficiency. <br>Those who pay for what they buy upon credit, pay their share of this advance. <br>He that pays ready money, escapes, or may escape, that charge. <br>A penny saved is two pence clear. A pin a-day is a groat a-year. Save <br>and have. Every little makes a mickle. <br><br>XI Mon. January hath xxxi days.<br><br>God offer'd to the Jews Salvation, <br>And 'twas refus'd by half the Nation: <br>Thus (tho' 'tis Life's great Preservation,) <br>Many oppose Inoculation. <br>We 're told by one of the black Robe, <br>The devil inoculated Job: <br>Suppose 'tis true, what he does tell ; <br>Pray, Neighbours, Did not Job do well? <br><br>The greatest monarch on the proudest throne, is oblig’d to sit upon his own arse.<br>The master-piece of Man, is to live to the purpose. <br>He that steals the old man's supper do's him no wrong. <br><br>XII Mon. February hath xxviii days.<br><br>The Thracian Iinfant, entering into Life, <br>Both Parents mourn for, both receive with Grief; <br>The Thracian Infant snatched by Death away, <br>Both Parents to the Grave with Joy convey. <br>This Greece and Rome you with Derision view, <br>This is meer Thracian Ignorance to you; <br>But if you weigh the Custom you despise, <br>This Thracian Ignorance may teach the wise. <br><br>A countryman between two lawyers, is like a fish between two cats. <br>He that can take rest is greater than he that can take cities. <br>The miser's cheese is wholesomest. <br><br>I Mon. March hath xxxi days.<br><br>Doris a Widow past her Prime, <br>Her Spouse long dead, her Wailing doubles; <br>Her real Griefs increase by Time; <br>What might abate, improves her Troubles. <br>Those Pangs her prudent Hopes supprest, <br>Impatient now she cannot smother, <br>How should the helpless Woman rest ? <br>One's gone; — nor can she get another. <br><br>Love and Lordship hate companions. <br>The nearest way to come at glory, is to do that for conscience which we do for glory. <br>There is much money given to be laught at, though the purchasers don't know it; <br>witness A's fine horse, and B's fine house. <br><br>II Mon. April hath xxx days.<br><br> A Nymph and a Swain to Apollo once prayed, <br>The Swain had been jilted, the Nymph been betray'd; <br>They came for to try if his oracle knew, <br>E'er a Nymph that was chast, or a Swain that was true. <br>Apollo stood mute, and had like t' have been pos'd, <br>At length he thus sagely the question disclos'd; <br>He alone may be true in whom none will confide, <br>And the nymph may be chaste that has never been tryd. <br><br>He that can compose himself, is wiser than he that composes books. <br>Poor Dick eats like a well man, and drinks like a sick. <br>After crosses and losses, men grow humbler and wiser. <br>Love, Cough, and a Smoke, can't well be hid. <br><br>III Mon. May hath xxxi days.<br><br>Rich Gripe does all his Thoughts and Cunning bend <br>T’encrease that Wealth he wants the Soul spend: <br>Poor Shifter does his whole Contrivance set, <br>To spend that Wealth he wants the Sense to get, <br>How happy would appear to each his Fate, <br>Had Gripe his humour, or he Gripe's Estate? <br>Kind Fate and Fortune, blend 'em if you can, <br>And of two Wretches make one happy Man. <br><br>Well done is better than well said. <br>Fine linnen, girls and gold so bright, <br>Chuse not to take by candle light. <br>He that can travel well afoot, keeps a good horse. <br>There are no ugly Loves, nor handsome Prisons. <br>No better relation than a prudent and faithful Friend. <br><br>IV Mon. June hath xxx days<br><br>Boy, bring a Bowl of China here, <br>Fill it with Water cool and clear; <br>Decanter with Jamaica right, <br>And Spoon of Silver, clean and bright, <br>Sugar twice-fin'd in pieces cut, <br>Knife, Sieve, and Glass in order put, <br>Bring forth the fragrant Fruit, and then <br>We'er happy till the Clock strikes Ten. <br><br>A traveller should have a hog's nose, deer's legs and an ass's back <br>At the working man’s house hunger looks in, but dares not enter. <br>A good Lawyer, a bad Neighbour.

V Mon. July hath xxxi days<br><br>Impudent Jack, who now lives by his Shifts, <br>Borrowing of Driblets, boldly begging Gifts, <br>For Twenty Shillings lent him t'other Day, <br>(By one who ne'er expected he would pay,) <br>On his Friend's Paper fain a Note wou'd write; <br>His Friend, as needless, did refuse it quite; <br>Paper was scarce, and 'twas too hard, it's true, <br>To part with Cash, and lose his Paper too. <br><br>Certainlie these things agree, The Priest, The Lawyer, & Death, all three <br>Death takes both the weak and the strong, <br>The Lawyer takes from both right and wrong, <br>And the priest from the living and dead has his fee. <br>The worst wheel of the cart makes the most noise. <br><br>VI Mon. August hath xxxi days<br><br>On his Death-bed poor Lubin lies; <br> His Spouse is in Despair; <br>With frequent Sobs, and mutual Cries <br> They both express their Care. <br>A diff’rent Cause, says Parson Sly, <br> The same Effect may give, <br>Poor Lubin fears that he shall die; <br> His Wife — that he may live. <br><br>Don't misinform your Doctor nor your Lawyer. <br>I never saw an oft-transplanted tree, <br>Nor yet an oft-removed family, <br>That throve so well as those that settled be. <br><br>VII Mon. September hath xxx days<br><br>To-morrow you'll reform, you always cry; <br>In what far Country does this Morrow lie, <br>That 'tis so mighty long ere it arrive? <br>Beyond the Indies does this Morrow live? <br>'Tis so far-fetched, this Morrow, that I fear <br>'Twill be both very old, and very dear. <br>Tomorrow I'll reform, the Fool does say; <br>To-day it self 's too late; — the Wise did yesterday. <br><br>Let the Letter stay for the Post, and not the Post for the Letter. <br>Three good meals a day is bad living. <br>'Tis better leave for an enemy at one's death, than beg of a friend in one's life. <br>To whom thy secret thou dost tell, <br>To him thy freedom thou dost sell. <br><br>VIII Mon. October hath xxxi days<br><br>On T. T. who destroy’d his Landlord's fine Wood.<br><br>Indulgent Nature to each kind bestows, <br>A secret Instinct to discern its Foes: <br>The Goose, a silly Bird, avoids the Fox; <br>Lambs fly from Wolves; and Sailors steer from rocks; <br>A Rogue the Gallows, as his fate, foresees, <br>And bears the like Antipathy to Trees. <br><br>If you'd have a Servant that you like, serve yourself. <br>He that pursues two Hares at once, does not catch one and lets t'other go. <br>If you want a neat wife, chuse her on a Saturday. <br>If you have time, dont wait for time. <br><br>IX Mon. November hath xxx days<br><br>You say you'll spend Five hundred Pound, <br> The World and Men to know, <br>And take a Tour all Europe round, <br> Improving as you go. <br>Dear Sam, in search of others Sense, <br> Discover not your own; <br>But wisely double the Expence, <br> That you may pass unknown. <br><br>Tell a miser he's rich, and a woman she's old, you'll get no money of one, nor kindness of t'other. <br>Don't go to the doctor with every distemper, nor to the lawyer with every quarrel, nor to the pot for every thirst. <br><br>X Mon. December hath xxxi days<br><br>Women are Books, and Men the Readers be, <br>Who sometimes in those Books Erratas see; <br>Yet oft the Reader's raptur’d with each Line, <br>Fair Print and Paper, fraught with Sense divine; <br>Tho' some, neglectful, seldom care to read, <br>And faithful Wives no more than Bibles heed. <br>Are Women Books? says Hodge, then would mine were <br>An Almanack, to change her every year. <br><br>The Creditors are a superstitious sect, great observers of set days and times. <br>The noblest question in the world is, What good may I do in it? <br>Nec sibi, sed toto, genitum se credere mundo. <br>Nothing so popular as GOODNESS. <br><br>In my last I published some Enigmatical Prophecies, which I did not expect <br>any one would take for serious Predictions. The Explanation I promised follows, <br>viz : <br> 1. The Water of the Sea and Rivers is raised in Vapours by the Sun, is form'd into Clouds in the Air, and thence descends in Rain. Now when there is Rain overhead (which frequently happens when the Wind is at N. E.) the Cities and Places on the Earth below, are certainly under Water. <br> 2. The Power with which we were not then at War, but which, it was said, would take many full laden Vessels out of our Ports before the End of the Year, is The WIND, whose Forces also are not descried either coming or going. <br> 3. The Army which it was said would land in Virginia, Maryland, and the lower Counties on Delaware, were not Musketeers with Guns on their Shoulders as some expected ; but their Namesakes, in Pronunciation, tho' truly spelt Moschitos, arm'd only with a sharp Sting. Every one knows they are Fish before they fly, being bred in the Water ; and therefore may properly be said to land before they become generally troublesome. <br><br>A WONDERFUL PROPHECY.<br>For January, 1737, which consists entirely of odd Figures.<br><br>E'er of this odd odd Year one Month has roll'd, <br>What Wonders, Reader, shall the World behold! <br>Four Kings with mighty Force shall Albion's Isle <br>Infest with Wars and Tumults for a-while; <br>Then some shall unexpected Treasures gain, <br>While some mourn o'er an empty Purse in vain: <br>And many a Christian's Heart shall ake for Fear, <br>When they the dreadful Sound of Trump shall hear. <br>Dead Bones shall then be tumbled up and down, <br>In every City and in every town.

PREFACE BY MISTRESS SAUNDERS<br><br>Dear Readers, <br><br>My good Man set out last Week for Potowmack, to visit an old Stargazer of his Acquaintance, and see about a little Place for us to settle and end our Days on. He left a Copy of his Almanack seal'd up, and bid me send it to the Press. I suspected something, and therefore, as soon as he was gone, I open'd it, to see if he had not been flinging some of his old Skitts at me. Just as I thought, so it was. And truly (for want of somewhat else to say, I suppose,) he had put into his Preface, that his Wife Bridget --- was this, and that, and t'other. --- What a peasecods! cannot I have a little Fault or two, but all the Country must see it in print! They have already been told, at one time that I am proud, another time that I am loud, and that I have got a new Petticoat, and abundance of that kind of stuff; and now forsooth! all the World must know, that Poor Dick's Wife has lately taken a fancy to drink a little tea now and then. A mighty matter truly, to make a Song of! ‘Tis true I had a little tea of a present from the Printer last Year; and what, must a-body throw it away ? In short, I thought the Preface was not worth a printing, and so I fairly scratch'd it all out, and I believe you'll like our Almanack never the worse for it. <br><br>Upon looking over the months, I see he has put in abundance of foul Weather this Year; and therefor I have scattered here and there, where I could find room, some fair, pleasant, sunshiny, &c, for the Good-Women to dry their Clothes in. If it does not come to pass according to my Desire, I have shown my Good-will, however; and I hope they 'll take it in good part. <br><br>I had a Design to make some other Corrections ; and particularly to change some of the Verses that I don't very well like; but I have just now unluckily broke my Spectacles ; which obliges me to give it you as it is, and conclude. <br><br>Your loving friend,<br>BRIDGET SAUNDERS. <br><br>UNDER THE HEAD OF ECLIPSES, APPEARS THE FOLLOWING :<br><br>You will excuse me dear readers, that I afford you no eclipses of the moon this year. The truth is, I do not find they do you any good. <br><br>When there is one you are apt in observing it to expose yourselves too much and too long to the night air, whereby great numbers of you catch cold.

As I spent some weeks last winter in visiting my old acquaintance in the Jerseys, great complaints I heard for want of money, and that leave to make more paper bills could not be <br>obtained. Friends and countrymen, my advice on this head shall cost you nothing ; and if you will not be angry with me for giving it, I promise you not to be offended if you do not <br>take it, <br><br>You spend yearly at least two hundred thousand pounds, it is said, in European, East Indian, and West Indian commodities. Suppose one-half of this expense to be in things absolutely necessary, the other half may be called superfluities, or, at best, conveniences, which, however, you might live without for one little year and not suffer exceedingly. Now, to save this half, observe these few directions: <br><br> I. When you incline to have new clothes, look first well over the old ones, and see if you cannot shift with them another year, either by scouring, mending, or even patching if necessary. Remember, a patch on your coat and money in your pocket is better and <br>more creditable than a writ on your back and no money to take it off. <br><br> II. When you are inclined to buy chinaware, chintzes, India silks, or any other of their flimsy, slight manufactures, I would not be so bad with you as to insist on your absolutely resolving against it; all I advise is to put it off (as you do your repentance) till another year, and this, in some respects, may prevent an occasion of repentance. <br><br> III. If you are now a drinker of punch, wine, or tea twice a day, for the ensuing year drink them but once a day. If you now drink them but once a day, do it but every other day. If you do it now but once a week, reduce the practice to once a fortnight. And if you do not exceed in quantity as you lessen the times, half your expense in these articles will be saved. <br><br> IV. When you incline to drink rum, fill the glass half with water. <br><br>Thus at the year's end there will be a hundred thousand pounds more money in your country. <br><br>If paper money in ever so great a quantity could be made, no man could get any of it without giving something for it. But all he saves in this way will be his own for nothing, and his country actually so much richer. Then the merchants' old and doubtful debts may be honestly paid off, and trading becomes surer thereafter, if not so extensive.

Lucky Lem,<br>I write you this script from the North Atlantic, having sailed here aboard my sloop, where the King’s Limey’s are hot on my trail. I trust the Adventure Prize remains safe but I rest assured it is in the best of hands, yours. I have always trusted you as one of my most loyal and faithful men and that is why I now send you this scroll. It is of the utmost importance that you do not open it as it could mean my life. Carry it with you always. Never give it to a soul no matter the price offered and believe whatever that cost might be, I will double it when I find you. I do not know when I’ll be free of these varlets but they will not catch me. People very well may come looking for my scroll. Trust no one.<br>Heed my warnings,<br>Captain William Kidd

To Abel Owens,<br>It has been a turn since we last tipped our tankards together and it will likely be a spell longer as I am in hiding off the coast of Massachusetts, I doubt this isle has even been graced with a name. The King’s men are breathing down my nape and quarters are too close for comfort. What you will find in this package is a scroll of the greatest value to me. Something that I hold dear above all the plunder and jewels that I have scattered about the globe, something that must remain secret and as such I must order you not to open it or read it. Carry it with you at all times and protect it, and what lies inside, with your life until I find you. It’s taking me longer than I anticipated to rid myself of those who stalk me but you know as well as I, it is only a matter of time before I shake them for good.<br>Be wary and wise,<br>Captain William Kidd

Joseph,<br>It has been months since we parted and things have not tacked to the easy course for me. I slew nine British sailors yesterday (or was it two days ago? No matter) and the bastards just keep sending more. But when I searched their corpses I found no commissions from the crown nor military orders, only coin and the red and golden crosses they bore around their necks. Is it possible they are not English sailors? It is of no consequence to you so on to the purpose of this letter; the scroll that came with it is everything to me. You cannot read it. You cannot open it. Keep it until I find you. If any man should ask you about it, kill him.<br>Captain William Kidd

They thirst for it- I know not who they are but I now know for certain they are not after me in the name of any crown. They are something else, something secret, something relentless, something with resources beyond measure. Something that frightens me like nothing else I have encountered in this life. I am holed up on a farm just outside Boston trying my most desperate and last ditch attempt rid myself of them for it cannot fall into their grasp. I have sent you the last piece of my precious scroll that leads me to where I stowed it. Hold it for me. They are upon me. If I come out the victor I will find you, if not- die with it. <br>Captain William Kidd

But as I searched the area the truth of their fates came clear. <br> <br>A fight broke out between them. Vicious, one of the men drawing a blade and stabbing the other. Then he set out for home.

BOONE: It stands upright, as a man, but its whole body is covered in a thick pelt. Its gait is slow and lurching- I've seen it with my own two eyes. It's clever, always at a distance or with something between us- like it knows where I'm gonna be before I get there. Things go missing where it goes, that much is certain. All manner of trinket. Took a man's prize buck antlers clear off his cabin wall. Takes kills outta traps too, wrenching 'em open with his big mitts. Somebody should find it and bring back its head for the world to see.<br><br>CONNOR: I found the beast Boone spoke of, covered in fur head to toe. Whereas the tales of his wits and bent for theft are true, those of him being a monster are not. He is just a man. A man who chooses to live in solitude. As for the missing property, I might suggest being more careful.

BOONE: I'm not one for sailing but I know it's out there. Some call it a kraken, others just a sea monster. They say it's fifty feet long if it's an inch and it rolls ships for sport. You won't find me out on the high seas searching for the beast, that's a guarantee I can give you, but it's a riddle that needs solving.<br><br>CONNOR: People across Boston spoke of seeing the monster. Reports varied in the details but most agreed that it was long and black and only appeared in the presence of an old man. Turns out the creature was the old man himself, diving in the water with a contraption that allowed him to breathe while submerged. The machine itself was as startling as any monster, but it poses no danger to ships.

BOONE: I'd been out in the puckerbrush for six weeks. Game was scarce in the area and my belly needed fillin' so a broke for the coast and some crab or lobster from the tide pools. That's when I saw it. A lighthouse said to have been abandoned years ago, but there it was fires a burnin'. Then the sound happened. A moaning in the wind. My heart crept up my throat so high I could taste it. Just then a ten point buck startled and I took after it. Got the buck but never went back to the lighthouse. Spirits in there I wager. I'd challenge any man to venture nearby.<br><br>CONNOR: I went to the lighthouse and it was abandoned. Among the debris left by its previous occupants, I found nothing more than a scarecrow. There are no spirits up there, none that must be feared at any rate.

BOONE: The first time I saw the light was back in Boston. I was trading my biggest take of the season when it rose from behind Beacon Hill. Went straight up in the night sky, passed the moon. Then it was gone. I wasn't alone. Those next to me had their heads cocked the same- craned as far back as it could go- mouths agape. Couldn't tell you what it was but I can tell you it wasn't of this earth.<br><br>CONNOR: This image sky is the talk of Boston. However, my investigation revealed that the source is most certainly of this earth. Nothing more than an umbrella reflecting moonlight among in the trees, coupled with imagination and gossip.

BOONE: I've never seen him myself but I've heard the stories from here to Kentucky. A German mercenary- Hessians they call 'em- was fighting a battle when a cannonball took his head clean off. His whole battalion was routed and they lost the encounter. But the lad didn't die. He's been wandering the bush on horseback around the battlefield ever since, searching for his head, chasin' innocents when he sees 'em, taking their domes for his own. He wears a pumpkin for a head now, until he finds what he's looking for. Like I said, I haven't seen 'em, but I have seen the bodies he leaves lying about, headless and grotesque. God rest their souls.<br><br>CONNOR: I found the Headless Horseman. The stories of his taking human heads are no fables. But he was a man.

This is a musical instrument created by Benjamin Franklin. He came up with the idea after seeing someone 'play' water-filled wine glasses at a show in London. It seems there wasn’t much entertainment in those days, and even the entertainment wasn’t much entertainment.<br><br>The principle of the Armonica is the same - the instrument itself is a series of bowls stacked together. You use a treadle to turn them and 'play' them by running a wet finger along the turning edges of the bowls. <br><br>The Armonica debuted in London in 1762, and became quite popular for a time - particularly in Germany, where Mozart wrote two pieces for it. That’s a pretty sweet celebrity endorsement. However, its success was short-lived. It quickly fell out of favour, probably because there was no way to amplify it to be heard in large concert halls.<br><br>Of course, that sounds quite dull so I'd much rather believe the more dramatic alternate explanation - playing the armonica was banned because it could cause insanity. <br><br>I’d certainly go mental if someone forced me to sit in a hall and listen to it. Mind you, I’ve got a soft spot for the bagpipes, so maybe I’m halfway there.

Heating a home in the 18th Century posed some problems. You more or less needed a fire - kept in a fireplace - but fireplaces were inefficient, smoky, and had to be built against wall, meaning you were losing heat through the back wall of your house. Not to mention the quantities of wood required to heat a city caused rapid deforestation (yes, people wanted to save the trees even in the 1700s – that’s really worked out, hasn’t it?) <br><br>This was Benjamin Franklin's solution to the problem - modestly named the Franklin Stove.<br><br>The stove is essentially metal fireplace that could be placed in the middle of a room, rather than on the outside. According to Franklin's designs, it could use 1/4 of the wood of a traditional fireplace, but give off twice as much heat. It also had a much smaller chance of giving off a spark that would burn your whole house down, which you've got to admit is an advantage in any heating system.<br><br>Franklin was offered a patent on the stove, but he decided not to take it- he wanted people to use his invention free of charge. Which was very philanthropic of him, but others weren't so civic-minded - at least one London merchant patented a modified version of the stove and made a fortune off of it.<br><br>Proof that the world was full of arseholes, even before the internet.

An electrostatic generator is a device used for generating static electricity for use in scientific experiments. In fact, that’s actually why it was named an Electrostatic Generator. This particular machine is an earlier version of the ones you find in science museums - you know, the things they use to make children's' hair stand on end (which teaches them that science can be fun!)<br><br>Of course, since there wasn’t enough science to fill a science museum in the 18th century, electrostatic generators were of somewhat limited use - until the invention of the Leyden Jar, which could actually store the electricity they created.

Id: [0x00064C55]
We all love jars, don’t we? And this jar is an early device for storing electricity - generally, the electricity made by an electrostatic generator. Benjamin Franklin used them in his experiments - they're a form of rudimentary battery. They were first invented in the town of Leyden in 1745, in what's now the Netherlands, by a scientist named Pieter van Musschenbroek. It was probably called the Leyden Jar because who in God’s name was going to ask for a van Musschenbroek Jar? Sounds like something you’d ask for in a club of ill repute.<br><br>The jar's design is fairly simple – mainly because it’s a jar. This one is a glass bottle with metal foil layered on the outside and inside - but it represents a huge step forward in the understanding of electricity, because it gave scientists something to work with. Before this they could create electricity, but had nowhere to store it - not exactly practical.<br><br>I'd be careful around the jar if I were you. You could get a nasty shock.  <br><br>Come to think of it, have a play with it. Go on. Forget I said anything.

An orrery is a clockwork device that's meant to show the rotation of the earth, moon and sun - although it might include other planets, depending on its size. Extremely hard to pronounce for people who can’t say their ‘r’s, orreries became popular in the 18th century as a conversation piece. No English gentleman's library was complete without one.<br><br>The name 'orrery' comes from the man who commissioned the first one - Charles Boyle, earl of Orrery. Oddly, it's not named after the man who invented it - George Graham - or the man who built it - John Rowley. Another example of the rich taking credit for something because they had the money to buy it - not because they had the brains to think it up in the first place.<br><br>Also, try to say the name out loud five times fast. It's not easy. And you’ll look insane.

Franklin invented the busybody based on a similar design he'd seen in Europe. It's a set of three mirrors meant to be hung from a second floor window. The mirrors are angled so that when you look out you can see who's knocking at your front door - a difficult prospect in some Philadelphia neighbourhoods, where the buildings are high and narrow. Of course, with a little tweaking, the mirrors can be used to watch your neighbor's door as well - hence the name (though I’d have called them ‘Nosy Old Bats’ and marketed them very much at the over-70s market).<br><br>Busybodies are still used in Philadelphia today, probably because knowing who's at your front door is handy, and spying on your neighbours never really goes out of style.

This engine was invented by James Watt, who worked on it between 1763 and 1776. It's not the first steam engine ever to be created - the design is based on something called the Newcomen engine, which dates back to 1712. However, the Watt engine is widely considered the first design that was actually practical.<br><br>Watt's engine had two advantages over other engines of the day - it operated at a low pressure - meaning that there would be fewer boiler explosions when it was used (and boiler explosions could be so annoying) - and didn't waste coal - which, like gasoline today, was expensive. In fact, his design was so good, it wouldn't be significantly improved on for another hundred years.

Benjamin Franklin is probably most famous for flying a kite with a metal key attached to the bottom through some storm clouds. <br><br>Without the science bit, that actually makes him just sound a bit simple. <br><br>So here’s what he was doing: He was trying to see whether he could pick up an electrical charge - thus proving some of his theories about electricity (namely that lightning was electricity, which might seem obvious now but which hadn't been proven at the time). The experiment was successful - the kite picked up a charge that caused visible sparks when a person touched the key.<br><br>Of course, the popular myth is that Franklin flew the kite into the middle of a storm, and it was struck by lightning. That's obviously false, since it would have killed Franklin - or, if you believe popular comic books, turned him into some sort of superhero formed of pure electricity, which literally none of the history books seems to claim. <br><br>I’ll keep looking. It’s got to be in there somewhere.

The first drinkable glass of soda water was made by Joseph Priestley, a minister, philosopher and friend of Benjamin Franklin. In 1767, Priestley lived in Leeds, England, right next door to a brewery… which you might think sounds wonderfully convenient, but actually means that most things in your house end up smelling of yeast and malt – although, if you’ve ever been to Leeds, you’ll know your clothes smelling of yeast pretty much makes you posh. <br><br>Actually, in Leeds, clothes pretty much make you posh.<br><br>Priestley was given permission to perform scientific experiments above the vats in the brewery - a flagrant violation of modern health codes, but apparently not frowned upon at the time. He found that when he held a bowl of water above the brewery gases (which he called "fixed air"), they infused the water, making it bubbly.<br><br>Priestley excitedly shared his new beverage with his friends, but he didn't realize (or didn't care about) its money-making potential. The creation of soft drinks would have to wait for future (and more "financially motivated") innovators.

The Providence was one of many sailing ships in the British Merchant Navy - which basically means it was a trade ship, rather than one meant for war. You'll notice it's carrying cannon, but those are mainly for protection against pirate or privateer vessels (or for turning the ship into a privateer vessel, should the need arise.)<br><br>The ship was built in 1748, and made several trips a year between Britain and the North American colonies - with occasional visits to the West Indies. The manifest doesn't indicate anything particularly interesting - mostly it carried staples like tea, molasses and cloth. It's captained by its part-owner, one Samuel Smythe, who got something of a reputation among sailors for both cruelty to his crew and penny-pinching on rations.  <br><br>Incidentally - that's not exactly a way to keep good sailors on board. The crew is probably both inexperienced and disgruntled. Ideally, you want an experienced crew who are hugely gruntled. Although you likely don't know much about running an 18th century sailing vessel - odds are you won't notice the difference.

Don't let appearances deceive you - you're looking at the former flagship of the Assassin navy - if perhaps a little past its prime.<br><br>The Aquila was built in France in 1749, in the city of Brest. <br><br>Stop it.<br><br>The design was incredibly innovative for its time - the ship was light, fast, and could carry a surprising amount of artillery for its size.  It would be decades before there were schooners that could match the Aquila's speed. Of course, there were some disadvantages to the design - namely that the ship handling was very touchy and required an experienced crew. That meant the Aquila was under-utilized until the Assassins hired someone who would be able to use the ship to its full potential - Robert Faulkner. <br><br>In 1754, the Aquila followed a Templar ship into a storm and was lost with all hands aboard - or so we wanted the Templars to think. In reality, it sustained only minor damage, was refitted, and became the Assassins' secret weapon  - staying out of major harbours, using its speed and the element of surprise to harass ships on Templar business. The Aquila took on mythical qualities - it was whispered about in ports along the eastern seaboard as the "Ghost of the North Seas" - a pirate vessel crewed by ghosts that could appear and disappear into a sudden fog.  (This reputation was due both to Faulkner's uncommon skill, and the superstitious nature of most sailors, who loved a ghost story and all wanted to marry a mermaid.)<br><br>Eventually the Templars cottoned on to what had happened - but it did take them more than a decade. (They weren’t the sharpest tools, let’s say, in a box full of spoons.) In 1768, the ship was caught in a trap by 3 British frigates. The Aquila was able to limp away from the battle, but ran aground in shallow water. The British left it for lost. Robert Faulkner survived the battle, and had the ship towed back to a private bay near Boston, where it - and Faulkner - slowly deteriorated.<br><br>That is, until Connor found them both.

If a ship could sound sexy, it’s this one. La Belladona was one of the first French ships to carry aid to the Continental Army - starting before France officially joined the American Revolution, but (obviously) after they started secretly supplying the Patriots with weaponry. <br><br>The ship's original name wasn't Belladonna - it was repainted before it left France in order to keep its nature and destination a secret. The crew, however, was French, captained by Lieutenant Commander Auguste Le Moyne.  The ship's cargo was valuable enough that it warranted a personal escort from the USS Randolph. However according to LeMoyne's log, after two weeks at sea, the Randolph disappeared one morning - never to reappear. <br><br>Fortunately for them, Connor happened along.

The USS Randolph is one of the first ships built for the Continental Navy. Congress ordered its construction in December 1776. It's a 32-gun frigate, with a somewhat spotty history. And no, I don't just mean that fact that it was captained by a known Templar - Nicholas Biddle.<br><br>The ship was finished in July of 1776, but Biddle didn't come aboard as captain until October. Even then, the ship suffered from a lack of experienced crew - it was eventually staffed by British sailors who had been imprisoned in Philadelphia. The Randolph finally set sail in February of 1777, only to end up in Charlestown in March, with its masts broken and its crew decimated by fever. What a rubbish trip. What’s more, there'd also been a mutiny, which you should probably expect when you try to press British sailors into service of an enemy navy. It sort of goes against what they stand for.<br><br>Repairs to the ship took longer than expected, since the masts were hit by lightning twice while construction was underway. After that lightning rods were installed on the masts. (You'd think they might have thought of that earlier, but to be fair lightning rods were a relatively new-fangled invention at the time.)<br><br>The Randolph didn't really begin its military career in earnest until it left Charlestown in August, 1777 - more than a year and a half after Congress ordered it built.

You probably don't know much about 18th Century Naval Warfare (because you don't know much about anything at all), so here's a rundown of some of the types of vessels you're likely to encounter:<br><br>FRIGATES - these are long, relatively light vessels with a lot of guns - more than 28, if you want to get technical about it. Frigates were light and easily maneuverable, so they were often used for reconnaissance, or escorting merchant vessels. “Frigate” is also a terrific word to use if you want to swear but your mother-in-law is nearby.<br><br>GUNBOATS - These were smaller vessels, generally containing only one gun - but it was a really big gun. The gun in the boat is where the term “gunboat” gets the word “gun” from – it’s not known why the word “boat” is there. Gunboats were relatively inexpensive to build, and could be assembled quickly. They were most often used to bombard targets on land. Although gunboats can easily be destroyed by a larger ship - such as a frigate - several gunboats together could do some serious damage before a larger ship could destroy them all. Strength in numbers. And guns, of course. Mostly guns.<br><br>SCHOONER - Schooners are small, light craft, noted for their speed.  These were the preferred ships for privateers during the American Revolution - there was nothing better for breaking through enemy lines faster than you could get shot at - or for making a fast getaway. Nowadays, of course, we have jet skis.<br><br>MAN O' WAR - This isn't really a naval classification, but more of a catch-all term for a warship carrying a lot of cannon. Most of the Man o' Wars you'll see will likely be Ships of the Line, which are essentially big ships with multiple gun decks stacked on one another. Basically, naval warfare consisted of lining up your ships broadside against the enemy's ships in order to hit them with the most cannonballs possible. Of course, the enemy would be trying to do the same thing. Predictably, the biggest ships with the most guns usually won - leading to the building of more ships, with even bigger guns. It wasn’t sophisticated, but by God, it worked.

Mason Locke Weems (later known as Parson Weems) was a one-time parish rector who became a travelling bookseller, writer and editor. He's mostly famous for his biography of the life of George Washington, first published in 1800. He was briefly the rector of Mount Vernon parish, meaning he counted George Washington as one of his parishioners.<br><br>Weems was a colourful character, and a bit of a rogue - always with some story to tell, most of them completely untrue - or vastly exaggerated. It's from Weems' biography of Washington that we get the well-known story of Young George bravely confessing that he chopped down his father's prized cherry tree. Weems writes that the story is "too true to be doubted", but who knows whether the phrase “too true to be doubted” is too true to be doubted...<br><br>Weems also went on to write biographies of Benjamin Franklin, Francis Marion, and William Penn - again, prizing being entertaining over actual fact. They sold well, however - paving the way for tabloid newspapers everywhere.

Charles Lee was a British soldier who went on to be a major figure in the Revolutionary War.<br><br>Lee's father was a Colonel in the British army, and started his son off in a military career early. He was sent to a military academy in Switzerland during his formative years, and then in 1746, Lee became an ensign in his father's regiment.<br><br>Lee was sent to the colonies in 1755 to fight in the French and Indian war. He served under Edward Braddock and then later at Fort Ticonderoga, where he was injured in the fighting. Lee recovered, and later fought at Fort Niagara. I’d always thought there were a lot of Fort fights fought. He finished his time in the colonies with the British conquest of Montreal.<br><br>Lee returned to England in 1760, possibly because he was seeking career advancement. He was named a Major in 1761 and was sent to fight the Spanish in Portugal. Though his service record there was good, Lee didn't receive praise on his return home - in fact, he was retired from the army at half-pay. After that, Lee became a vocal critic of military higher-ups, and the British Prime Minister - and found that his military career had (inexplicably!) completely stalled.

Benjamin Church was a talented physician, and essentially the first Surgeon General of the US Army.<br><br>Church was born in Rhode Island, and graduated from Harvard University in 1754 - so you're meeting him here just out of college. He'll be appointed head of the medical wing of the Continental Army in 1775, but for God’s sake don’t tell him, it’ll go straight to his head. <br><br>Church goes on to become a vocal Patriot – which makes him sound like a member of a weird barbershop quartet. But he was a member of the Sons of Liberty, and his local Committee of Correspondence. He'll even speak at the third anniversary of the Boston Massacre.<br><br>He's also got a house in a very nice part of town - being a doctor must pay well.

Here's a name even you should recognise - George Washington, who will go on to be the leader of the army during the American Revolution, and the first President of the United States. <br><br>I was going to say you probably know everything I'm going to tell you but that would be a lie. What you know is that George Washington has a lot of things named after him, and anything else you learned in school you forgot because you thought you'd never use it in real life. (You should call your history teacher and tell her she was right all along.)<br><br>George Washington was the son of a planter from Virginia. He was raised with little education, but was ambitious, teaching himself mostly from books. <br><br>Washing started in business early, speculating on land starting at the age of 18. When he was 20, his older brother died, leaving him the heir of the family plantation at Mount Vernon - where he lived until his death, and where you can still visit his grave today.<br><br>Washington got his military start during the French and Indian War, leading an expedition to Fort Duquesne in 1754 - a destination he never reached, having surrendered at Fort Necessity. The next year, Washington headed to Fort Duquesne again, this time as a guide for Edward Braddock during the ill-fated Braddock Expedition. Washington went as a volunteer, hoping that working for Braddock would get him a track to military promotion. Though the battle was a rout, Washington earned credit for organizing the retreat, and later that year he was made a Colonel in charge of the Virginia militia.<br><br>Washington completely revamped the militia, with hopes that under his organization and training they would be accepted into the British military. They never were. Washington resigned his post in 1758. I won't say the snub led to his contempt for the British, but snubs rarely help. <br><br>By the late 1760s, Washington had become active in political life - taking on a role in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He went on to be a member of the Continental Congress, and when war broke out in 1775, he was Congress's choice to lead the army. At the time Washington said, "I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with." Which I'm sure inspired complete confidence in everyone who heard it. Imagine if you were on an airplane and the captain opened with that.<br><br>It's possible Washington was being falsely modest, but the fact is this: he wasn't a military genius, and he knew it. (Though I'm sure it hurts your American pride to hear me say he wasn't perfect.) Washington had several narrow misses where the army could have easily been obliterated - at Manhattan, and again at Brandywine - among others.<br><br>Washington won an early victory he broke the siege of Boston, but he then made the disastrous move of fortifying New York - a city he couldn't defend without a navy he didn't have. Even you can work that one out. He spent the latter half of 1776 retreating across New York and New Jersey, losing battle after battle, until Christmas, when he pulled off a successful surprise attack the Hessian troops at Trenton. <br><br>(And while that battle makes for some famous paintings, and it did rally the flagging confidence of the public, it was a minor victory in the war.)

Better known as "Lafayette", and it’s not surprising - his full name was "Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette". His business cards must have been three feet long. Lafayette was a French aristocrat and soldier who decided to join the Revolutionary War, and became one of George Washington's most loyal supporters. (I'm sure his friends just called him MJ.)  <br><br>Lafayette came to the colonies in 1777, intent on joining the war effort. So intent, in fact, that he abandoned his post in the French army. When the French army found out his plans, the ship he intended to sail on was seized, and according to one story, Lafayette dressed in women's clothing to better stow away on another ship heading for the New World. We’ve all done it.<br><br>Lafayette had been promised a place in the army before he left France, but once he arrived Congress became worried that he was just a glory-seeker. To smooth things over, Lafayette offered to work for free - and the ever-thrifty Congress awarded him a commission as a Major General. That may seem a hefty rank for someone who wasn't quite 20 years old, but Lafayette was both rich and a French noble, and at the time Congress was hoping to secure more aid from the French government. It would have made me suspicious. There’s no such thing as a free French.<br><br>Lafayette was placed as an aide-de-camp to George Washington – probably because that’s a French word and it seemed to fit - and the two became good friends. Political connections aside, he was an excellent addition to the army. Lafayette was a natural leader - his first real fight was at the Battle of Brandywine, where he was wounded. Despite that, Lafayette organized and led an orderly retreat - which saved hundreds of lives. <br><br>In 1779, Lafayette returned to France, where he negotiated for more troops to be sent to fight in the Revolution - exactly what Congress had hoped for when they hired him. After Lafayette returned to the colonies, he was placed in charge of the French troops, and was responsible for chasing General Cornwallis into Yorktown. There were other people there too. It wasn’t just one man chasing another into a town. That would have looked undignified.<br><br>After the war, Lafayette returned to France, where he was a leader during the initial part of the French Revolution. Unfortunately for him, he advocated a constitutional monarchy and had to flee when that wasn't enough to satisfy the general populace. He returned to the United States in 1825 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the revolution - and was greeted by adoring crowds.<br><br>In 2002, Lafayette was declared an honourary citizen of the United States, one of seven people to ever receive the tribute. Arrogantly, Lafayette didn’t even bother turning up to the ceremony. <br><br>That’s the French for you.

James Barrett was a Colonel in the rebel militia for Concord, and the town's representative in the Boston legislature in the years leading up to the revolution.<br><br>Barrett didn't exactly want the position at the head of the militia. He was 65 when the war started. He had his pipe and slippers ready and probably just wanted to watch game shows. Unfortunately for him, experienced commanders were in short supply, and Barrett had fought in the French and Indian war – so, colonel it was.<br><br>When the British came to Lexington and Concord looking for rebel weapons caches, troops headed straight to Barrett’s farm, where they were told they’d find the majority of the supplies.  Of course, by the time they’d arrived most of the weapons had been removed and hidden elsewhere.  Barrett wasn’t there, either. He was some distance away, organizing the militia march on the North Bridge – and overseeing the eventual victory at Concord.

Nicholas Biddle was an ambitious young sailor who became one of the first captains of the Continental Navy.   <br><br>Biddle joined the Royal Navy in 1770 (I mean the British side), but when the American Revolution started he offered his services to the Continental Congress. So a traitor, then - though it’s funny how you lot don’t generally see it that way. Anyway, while he was only a midshipman for the British, Congress quickly gave him command of his own ship, the Franklin. In 1776 was offered an even better deal - command of a brand new ship, named the Randolph.<br><br>History's mute on the reasons behind Biddle's rise to prominence. However, I think I might be able to solve the mystery - we saw Church recruiting him when Connor stopped at Nantucket.  <br><br>Biddle eventually became a privateer for the Continental Congress, patrolling British shipping routes, harassing their ships and keeping the spoils from any he could capture. He had a reputation as an excellent captain –he divided the spoils evenly, and never used corporal punishment against his crew. What a softy. Pitiful, really. Though I think you can see why that would be a job perk.

Israel Putnam (more affectionately known as "Old Put") is something of a legendary figure in Revolutionary War history, and possibly its best-known soldier – a bit of a folk hero, if you will. <br><br>Putnam was born in Massachusetts, but later moved to Connecticut to take up farming.  He's credited with killing the last wolf in the colony – crawling into its den with a musket, a torch, and a rope tied around his feet so he could be pulled back out. He really didn’t like wolves. Oh, and I believe I mentioned he was a folk hero? That's only part of it.<br><br>He joined the colonial militia during the French and Indian war, where he earned a reputation for bravery and inspiring the soldiers around him. He was captured by a group of Kanien'kehá:ka in 1758, and rescued just before he was to be executed. In 1762 he was shipwrecked in Cuba while on a campaign there where – you'll love this – he learned about cigars. He became a habitual smoker, and is credited with introducing the cigar to the colonies.<br><br>After the war ended, Putnam returned to Connecticut, where he was a vocal opponent of the British tax policies that led to the revolution. He founded the Connecticut branch of the Sons of Liberty. When he heard about the battle of Lexington and Concord, he immediately signed up for the Continental Army and was named Brigadier General of the Connecticut forces. He commanded troops at Bunker Hill – and the near-success of the rebels there sealed his reputation.<br><br>Washington had high hopes for Putnam as a leader, and he was named Washington's second-in-command in New York just prior to the battle of Long Island. Unfortunately, Putnam was a good soldier but a poor tactician. The battle at Long Island was a rout. Putnam fared no better at his next post guarding forts on the Hudson River, where he was outmatched by General Henry Clinton. After that, Putnam requested to be assigned to recruitment and Washington agreed.<br><br>Still. At least he had cigars.

Benjamin Franklin was a renowned inventor, diplomat, and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Translation: he was a rock star of the age.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston in 1706, the 10th son of a soap-maker. Ten sons! I guess his parents couldn’t afford a television. And also, there was no television. <br><br>He began working for his brother in 1718, as an apprentice printer. However, their relationship was rocky, particularly after the elder Franklin found out that young Benjamin had been writing for the paper under a pseudonym - Silence Dogood - and writing an extremely popular column at that.  (Human nature being what it is, the fact that the column was popular was probably the bigger problem.)<br><br>Benjamin ran away in 1723, and headed for Philadelphia, where he continued his career in printing and writing, eventually buying the Pennsylvania Gazette. The business, I mean – not just a copy. That would have been one of his lesser achievements. He stayed in Philadelphia for most of his life - that is, when he wasn't making extended trips to Europe.<br><br>Franklin had a talent for persuasion, and that made him an ideal diplomat. In 1757 he went to London to represent Pennsylvania in an ongoing legal battle with the Penn family. It was the first of several extended political trips to Britain, and he would act as the state representative for Massachusetts, Georgia and New Jersey as well. In fact, Franklin was in Europe for most of the Revolution, though he was in the colonies to help with the writing of the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>Franklin was a vocal opponent of British impositions on the colonies (like the Stamp Act), and although he first fought for the rights of Colonists as British citizens he eventually became convinced (like many of the founding fathers) that independence was the only real solution. Unfortunately, Franklin's change of heart made him clash with his son, William - who served as the Royal Governor of New Jersey. William remained an active Loyalist - the father and son never spoke again.<br><br>When he wasn't founding a new nation (and destroying his family in the process) Franklin was a scientist, inventing things like bifocals and more efficient wood stoves when he wasn’t mapping the Gulf Stream and discovering how electricity worked. (What have YOU done today? Made yourself a microwave meal and sat about in your underwear. Oh well done, you.)<br><br>He was also quite the ladykiller - Jesus. This guy - carrying on several 'friendships' with women while he was in Europe. The records don't say what exactly they saw in him - certainly not his looks. Maybe women like a man who's intelligent. <br><br>(If that was true I wouldn't be here. I'd be in Portugal surrounded by them, and you’d be looking at a blank screen.)

William Johnson was a land speculator, and Britain's principal treaty negotiator with the Indigenous peoples in the northern part of the colonies - particularly the Iroquois.<br><br>Johnson was born in Ireland, but moved to the colonies in 1738 to look after his Uncle's property on the Mohawk River. However, it wasn't long before Johnson branched out into business for himself, acquiring property on the opposite side of the river and setting up a sawmill and trading post, which he named "Mount Johnson". Which to me always sounds like mating instructions from a caveman. In 1743 he moved to an even larger parcel of land which he named "Fort Johnson". (He may have been an excellent businessman, but it's possible he lacked an imagination.)<br><br>Johnson befriended the Indigenous peoples in the area, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka - whose language he learned. His respect for their customs helped him rise to prominence as liaison between the Iroquois peoples and the British government. Johnson was named Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1756. As a contact who knows the land and its people, he's probably the best you'll find.

In 1754, John Pitcairn was a young captain in the British Marine corps. He fought in the French and Indian war, but I can't find much about his postings. He's listed as being on the HMS Lancaster during the capture of Louisbourg - that's in Canada.  No record of him being on the 'American' side of the colonies but it seems he did some covert work as well - that would explain the lack of details. <br><br>Pitcairn was promoted to Major in 1771, and he gained a reputation for being well-liked by his subordinates - and praised by his enemies. That's a difficult trick to pull off. Maybe he had a lovely smile.

Thomas Hickey was an Irish-born member of the British Army. He arrived in Boston in 1752, but it wasn't long before he was assigned to William Johnson's personal guard, apparently at Johnson's request (possibly because their families were connected in Ireland, or maybe he found the name ‘Hickey’ funny, the record isn't clear.)<br><br> Hickey served under Johnson during the French and Indian war, but then he left the army after being written up several times for disorderly conduct. After 1760, Hickey disappears from the historical record for several years. I do, however, have several mentions in William Johnson's household accounts of payments made to "T.H.". It's possible Hickey was working for him as a spy. If so, he should really have developed some tougher codes to crack.

Alexander Hamilton was one of George Washington's trusted advisers during the American Revolution, and the first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States.<br><br>Hamilton was born in 1757 in the West Indies, and was orphaned at the age of 11. However, his cleverness showed early, and his employers pooled their money to send him to university. Either that, or they just wanted him out of the building. Hamilton moved to New York in 1773 and began attending King's College (later Columbia University). By 1774, he was writing pro-rebel articles – not really in the spirit of attending somewhere named after the King - and by 1775 he'd joined the volunteer militia. Again… probably not exactly what his sponsors had in mind when they sent him there.<br><br>Hamilton fought during the occupation of New York in 1776. He was a natural leader, and George Washington appointed him an aide-de-camp - a job he held for 5 years. However, Hamilton was eager to get back into battle and in 1781 he commanded troops during the decisive victory at Yorktown.  <br><br>Hamilton became a member of Congress for New York in 1788. He developed a particular fixation on the funding of the Federal Government, which at the time was… well, broke, as it wasn't allowed to demand any taxes from the member states. (While that may sound wonderful when you're looking at your federal tax bill, it meant the government couldn't do things like pay their army. Soldiers like getting paid.)<br><br> In 1787, Hamilton was named the first Secretary of the Treasury, where he fought for a strong federal government (in heated opposition with Thomas Jefferson, who promoted states rights). Hamilton was responsible for creating much of the foundation of the US Fiscal policy, the details of which are probably important, but so indescribably boring I can barely be bothered even to finish this sentence. <br><br>But I did. Because I care.

Benedict Arnold was a General in the American Revolution, and America's best-known traitor, though I’m not sure that’s what he would have had printed on his business cards. Arnold also happens to be a war hero on the American side, though many people don't know that. <br><br>Before Arnold turned traitor, he had a reputation both for bravery and for genuinely caring for the soldiers who served under him.  He was instrumental to the rebel capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May of 1775, and his leg was crippled during the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. So he certainly put the effort in.<br><br> Unfortunately, his career advancement was spotty - he had a habit of getting into arguments with his superior officers, which is usually not a good move if you want a promotion. While George Washington recommended him for various commands, other officers had no use for him. <br><br>When Arnold was given command of West Point in 1780, he promptly tried to turn it over to the British in exchange for £20,000 and a commission as a Brigadier General. That’s the spirit! The conspiracy was uncovered before Arnold could actually betray the fort - and he fled north.<br><br>Nobody knows for certain why Arnold betrayed the Americans. His frustrations in being passed over for promotion obviously had something to do with it. But there's also speculation that Arnold had significant debts - the money he'd been promised would be sure to settle that.<br><br>Unfortunately for him, he never received the promised cash - or at least, not all of it. Since the British didn't actually capture West Point, Arnold only received £6,000. And while he did become a Brigadier General as promised, nobody trusted him - once a traitor, always a traitor.

Samuel Adams was a Boston Lawyer, a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, and a prominent political figure during the lead up to the American Revolution. I think that’s put your little life into perspective, hasn’t it? <br>Adams was born in Massachusetts, the son of another Samuel Adams, who was a well-off merchant. Adams (the younger one) went to Harvard, graduating in 1740. He went into business for himself, but was a dismal failure and ended up taking a job in the family brewery. A lot of men turn to breweries when their businesses fail, but in rather a different way. And that was fortunate for his historical legacy, since his relationship to beer may be the only reason most Americans have even heard of him.<br><br>Adams was elected to the Massachusetts Legislature in 1765, which was the beginning of his political career. He was a staunch supporter of Colonists' Rights (mainly the ever popular arguments over whether British Parliament had a right to impose taxes), but wasn't pro-independence - at least not at first. (I think it’s fair to say he changed his mind later.)  <br><br>Adams is often portrayed as an angry radical - but that's a bit of a biased picture. Adams disliked vigilantism, for the most part (though he approved when a mob forced Boston's stamp collector to resign, so perhaps he only disliked SOME vigilantism).  In later years, when Adams was in Congress, he refused even to join a political party because he found the idea divisive (a sentiment which he shared with George Washington, incidentally).<br><br>However, Adams' reputation for being a rabble rouser is somewhat understandable. He was a representative for the town of Boston after the Boston Massacre, and succeeded in having the Regulars kicked out of town. He spoke at the Old South Meeting Hall just prior to the Boston Tea Party, and it's said he gave the signal for the dumping of the tea (though there's some debate over whether he was involved, which I’m happy about, as a gentleman does not waste tea). <br><br>Adams was infamous enough that he had to leave Boston for Lexington in 1775 - to avoid arrest by the British who considered him a troublemaker. When the siege of Boston began the Massachusetts Governor offered to pardon any rebels who would lay down their arms - EXCEPT Adams, and John Hancock. Overall, Adams certainly was a thorn in the side of the British - though what puzzles me is why some Americans think being an angry revolutionary was a bad thing. It got you where you are today, didn't it?<br>Actually, hang about, yes - maybe I see their point after all.

Thomas Jefferson was the principal writer of the Declaration of Independence, and went on to be the third president of the United States.<br><br>Jefferson was born in Virginia, the son of a wealthy plantation owner - which is the type of upbringing that gets you into all the right political circles. Now, normally the wealthy and powerful sided with the British during the Revolution, but Jefferson was college educated and widely-read, which may be why he became convinced that the Colonists had a point about the British screwing them over. <br><br>Jefferson wrote extensively about the British obligations to the Colonists - which he regarded as a kind of contract that the government was violating by imposing taxes. Incidentally I do mean he 'wrote' about it, because unlike some other revolutionary leaders, Jefferson wasn't a great speaker.  That didn't stop him from making his mark, of course - in 1775 he was sent to the Continental Congress as a representative for Virginia, where he wrote most of the Declaration of Independence. Sweet gig for a writer.<br><br>Interestingly, Jefferson tried to include a paragraph in the Declaration that blamed King George for slavery in the colonies. The paragraph was voted out - and more than a little ironic, since Jefferson owned a plantation, complete with more than a hundred slaves. Publicly, however, he was an abolitionist. Which was lovely for him – and I'm sure the people he owned were very proud.<br><br>Jefferson went on to hold a number of political offices - he was the governor of Virginia in 1780-82, and then became the American Minister to France in 1784. When he returned to the United States he joined George Washington's cabinet as the first Secretary of State, where he fought for stronger states and a weaker federal government, in opposition to Alexander Hamilton. He was elected President in 1800.<br><br>Don't tell him any of that, though. You'll totally ruin the surprise.

You'll have heard of Paul Revere's Midnight ride, of course – he was one of several riders sent to warn Lexington and Concord of a coming military raid on April 18th, 1775. Revere's role in the revolution was larger than that, however. He was a member of the Sons of Liberty and the Continental Congress, and a participant in the Boston Tea Party.<br><br>By trade, Revere was a silversmith, and one of the most skilled craftsmen in the colonies. He also did copper plate engraving– most notably, the image of the Boston Massacre that depicts British soldiers firing into the unarmed crowd at point-blank range. A very effective piece of propaganda. You get very little copper plate propaganda these days. It’s a dying art.<br><br>Revere was also a shrewd businessman and he went where the money was. When silverwork wasn't paying the bills, he made dental tools, and when gunpowder was scarce during the Revolutionary War, he built a gunpowder mill.  After the war ended Revere expanded his business into bell forging, eventually making the bell that hangs in King's Chapel, a Boston landmark.

Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben was a General in the Continental Army, and the person credited with transforming the US army from a disorganized militia to a fighting force capable of defeating the British. Just look at the name. That’s a name you’d trust going into battle.<br><br>Von Steuben got his start in the army as a teenager in the Prussian army, rising to the rank of Captain before being discharged. He was introduced to Ben Franklin in 1777 while Franklin was travelling in Europe. Franklin knew the Continental Army needed training and Von Steuben was an excellent candidate. Franklin wasted no time writing a glowing letter of introduction to George Washington. Before the year was out, Von Steuben was in Valley Forge - bringing with him his pet greyhound, which he wouldn't leave behind. (Making him a rival for Charles Lee, though Von Steuben was probably better-groomed. I have no idea why there's a connection between military geniuses and dogs.)<br><br>When Von Steuben arrived, he started by training one "model company" of soldiers who would in their turn train others, and effective way of spreading the training through the ranks. He also wrote a manual outlining his training method – in German, later translated.<br><br>In fact, Von Steuben spoke very little English, but could curse quite thoroughly in French and German, which he did frequently (you always learn the rude words first, don’t you?). Unfortunately for him, the effect of his cursing somewhat lost on the troops, so to make the point, Von Steuben would call over his translator and order him to curse at the soldiers instead. I'm not sure if the translator had one of the best jobs in the army - or one of the worst.<br><br>I’m going with best.

Edward 'Bulldog' Braddock was the Major General placed in charge of British troops at the beginning of the French and Indian War, probably because he had a nickname like ‘Bulldog’.<br><br>Braddock was serving as the acting Governor of Gibraltar when he received the command in North America. He was given control of two regiments of Regulars and assigned to win back Fort Duquesne from the French (known as the Braddock Expedition) - as part of a larger attack on the French colonies on the continent.<br><br>Braddock had been well-liked as the governor in Gibraltar, but things changed once he reached North America. He had been known for keeping strict order among his troops, but it seems he went beyond that into brutality. He gained a reputation for being quick-tempered and cruel. He also displayed a contempt for non-British soldiers that alienated the colonial militia he was trying to recruit. So a cruel, racist bulldog, then. They’re my least favourite type of bulldog.<br><br>Braddock took a bullet to the chest during a battle in 1755, rumour has it from one of his own soldiers.  Which is a job hazard when you're nasty to the people around you and they all have guns. Sounds like the bulldog may have been put down.

Daniel Boone was a hunter and trapper, who, through skill and luck, went on to become a near-mythic figure in stories about the American frontier. <br>Boone was born in Pennsylvania, but moved with his family to North Carolina in 1752. He travelled to the frontier frequently on hunting and trapping expeditions, across modern-day North Carolina, Florida, and into Kentucky - the list goes on, but I’ll stop it there, because it’s just a list of places, and that can be quite tedious.<br><br>Boone is sometimes credited with 'discovering' Kentucky - which is ridiculous as I’m fairly sure someone else must have seen it once - but he did have a major role in its colonization by Europeans.  In 1773, Boone headed for the interior of Kentucky with a group of settlers with the intention of starting a town. Now, the Kentucky interior had technically been ceded to the British after the treaty of Stanwix, but not all of the Indigenous residents agreed with the treaty - or the incursion onto their traditional lands. Boone's group hadn't gone far when the party was attacked. Boone's son was captured and tortured to death - and the Colonists left. <br><br>However, Boone went back in 1775 when he was hired by the Transylvania Company to blaze a trail to the interior, known as the "Wilderness Trail". Boone settled in the area, founding the town of Boonesborough – arrogant - which he later helped to save from attack by Shawnee warriors in the opening years of the revolution. <br><br>Boone was made famous in his later years not so much by his adventures (though he had many, which I'm sure he'll tell you about), but by books written about his life - some of which contained … let's just call them historical inaccuracies. The one where he wrestled a sixty-foot Man-fish springs to mind. In reality Boone wasn't one to embellish his experiences - which may be why people felt the need to do it for him.

Francois Joseph Paul de Grasse was an admiral in the French navy, and is probably best known for his victory in the Battle of the Chesapeake, where he prevented British troops from arriving to reinforce the army at Yorktown.<br><br>De Grasse was the youngest child of a French nobleman. He joined the military at the age of 11 when he became a page with the religious/military Order of Malta.  He joined the French Navy proper in 1740. By 1775 he was serving as a Captain, he helped secure Saint Domingue (now Haiti) for the French – which probably looked good on a resume at the time.  <br><br>De Grasse was promoted to Admiral in 1781 and despite failing health was given orders to sail for America to help Washington. His victory at Chesapeake was so significant that Washington wrote to him the day after Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown saying the honour of the victory belonged to De Grasse. <br><br>De Grasse died in 1788, just before the beginning of the French Revolution. Despite his role aiding rebels in America, De Grasse was considered nobility in France and his estate was ransacked by French revolutionaries. His family fled to the United States, where they were welcomed as the children of a hero.<br><br>I guess ‘hero’ and ‘oppressor’ all depend on your perspective. You say tomato, I say tom-ahto… you say potato, I say pot-ahto.<br><br>Actually, no one says potahto.

Harrison was a noted clock-maker, originally from Yorkshire. He's best-known for solving the problem of tracking longitude on extended ship voyages. If that sounds somewhat dull, please remember in the 18th century this was a life-or-death problem. Though that doesn’t change the fact that it involves phrases like ‘tracking longitude’, and I’m sorry, but that’s still dull.<br><br>It was tricky finding a satellite signal for sat nav in those days, so knowing the east-west position of your ship during an ocean crossing was vitally important- and extremely tricky.  You could navigate by the stars - but that only worked if the sky was clear and the water was calm. Alternately you could keep an accurate clock. Unfortunately, most clocks of the day couldn't keep time on a rocking ship - or withstand the damp conditions of a sea voyage. <br><br>In fact, the problem was so important that British parliament was offering £20,000 for a solution - a tidy sum. Harrison took up the challenge, and made 4 versions of his clock - the last was only 5 seconds off on a cross-ocean voyage to Jamaica. Even so. That made them 5 seconds late, and I hope they were fined.<br><br>Unfortunately when Harrison tried to claim the prize money, Parliament said his results were coincidence - maybe because they were hesitant to shell out the money, but possibly more because one of Harrison's competitors was serving as the Royal Astronomer, and didn't like being showed up. It took the intervention of the King himself before Harrison got his money. By then, he was 80 years old. Still. You can buy VERY fancy zimmers with twenty grand.

William Prescott was the Colonel in charge of the Continental Army troops sent to fortify Bunker Hill in 1775. He's often credited (and that’s a kind way of saying ‘blamed’) for the decision to fortify Breed's Hill instead - a military disaster.<br><br>Prescott had a reputation for being a passionate, brave fighter. He was one of the last to leave Bunker Hill when the rebels retreated – fighting British bayonets with his ceremonial sabre. He got several holes in his waistcoat from the adventure, which he loved to show his fellow soldiers, but which must really have annoyed his tailor.<br><br>Prescott is also somewhat famous for telling the troops "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes' – a warning to conserve ammunition until the enemy were close enough that the shots would hit. The saying is also attributed to Israel Putnam, and it's memorable enough that both men likely used it - I'll let other historians get into fistfights over who said it first.<br><br>Prescott went on to fight in New York City in 1776, and then returned home to Massachusetts. He fought again in the Battle of Saratoga in 1777, but apart from that he retired from army life. I'd wager he showed off those bayonet holes until the day he died, though.

Benjamin Tallmadge was the head of Intelligence for the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. The British, of course, would have called that an oxymoron.<br><br>Tallmadge was originally from New York, but moved to Connecticut before the revolution broke out. He served as a Lieutenant, and then a Major in the militia, before being asked by George Washington to lead the intelligence department. Tallmadge used his contacts in New York to form the Culper Ring - a league of spies that observed and reported on the British actions in New York. It's possible his contacts also discovered Benedict Arnold's treachery, but that's disputed.<br><br>After the war, Tallmadge returned to Connecticut, where he became a merchant - and politician. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1801.

John Fraser (Also spelled Frazer, or Frazier) was a Scottish-born trader living in the area of Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War, and a participant in the Braddock Expedition. <br><br>Fraser left Scotland sometime after 1745, possibly because of political troubles (the Frasers had supported the Stuarts, who were on the losing end of a rebellion). He set up trade on the upper Allegheny river, but was quickly run out of his cabin by the French. He moved further down the river - near modern-day Pittsburgh, built a new cabin and continued to trade. <br><br>Fraser was one of the settlers building a fort on the site of Fort Duquesne, (near his own land) when the French took over - again. Fraser supplied Washington's attempt to reclaim the fort in 1754 (which was followed by the defeat at Fort Necessity), and served as the Chief Scout during the Braddock Expedition.<br><br>After Braddock failed, Fraser gave up on the area - depriving the French of a third opportunity to chase him off his land, so I suppose that’s a small victory. He moved to the Tuscarora valley, before finally settling at Fort Bedford.

John Hancock was a Whig leader in Boston prior to the Revolutionary War, and went on to be the President of the Second Continental Congress - which was responsible for creating the Declaration of Independence. All very impressive. But most impressive of all was that his name would live on to be slang for ‘signature’. Now that’s a legacy. One day I imagine “Shaun” will be used by children to describe a world-weary sneer. I can but dream.<br><br>Hancock was born in Massachusetts, the son of a Reverend, but his father died when he was young, and John was sent to live with his Uncle in Beacon Hill. Thomas Hancock ran a prosperous shipping business, which John inherited when his uncle died in 1764.<br><br>Hancock was a noted businessman, and probably made at least some of this money smuggling - which he was tried for in 1768, though he was never convicted. He joined the Patriot cause after the Stamp Acts were imposed in 1764. He went on to be one of the instigators of the Tea Party. In fact, after the revolution began, he was such a well-known rebel that when the Boston Governor offered clemency to anyone who would lay down their arms, Hancock was specifically left out of the deal.<br><br>Hancock's probably best known for signing the Declaration of Independence; his signature was the first on the document. Possibly because of that - and possibly because Hancock was known for being extravagant - his name is signed with a flourish, written larger than any of the others. So now in America, your signature is sometimes referred to as "your John Hancock".<br><br>I needn’t explain why to some people, that sounds a little bit dirty! <br><br>But I will: it sounds like a penis reference.

John Parker was the Captain of the Lexington militia, and therefore the man in charge on the day of the battles at Lexington and Concord.  <br><br>Parker was a farmer by trade, but since he'd been soldier in the French and Indian War, he was placed in command despite the fact that he was quite ill with tuberculosis at the time. Parker went on to join the Continental Army in the Siege of Boston, but was too ill to be involved in the battle of Bunker Hill. <br><br>Parker died in September, 1775. The statue of the Minuteman on Lexington green is said to be a representation of him - though since there are no known pictures of Parker, the resemblance is sketchy at best. It's the thought that counts.

Robert Newman was the sexton of Christ Church (known today as the Old North Church), and a personal friend of Paul Revere’s. It was Newman who hung the lanterns from church steeple to warn riders in Charlestown that the British were marching on Lexington and Concord. Two lanterns – indicating that the British were travelling by sea.<br> <br>(And because it's a pet peeve of mine - you may have heard that Newman put up the lanterns to warn Revere about the British approach - it's one of those historical details everyone seems to get wrong. Revere already knew about the raid, and in fact had been the one to pass the knowledge on the Newman. The lanterns were meant as a warning to lookouts in Charlestown - a backup in case Revere was caught before he managed to leave town. Please learn this so you can impress girls on first dates, as I do, though they often seem so overwhelmed by it they rarely call again. That’s the power of knowledge, and it’s dangerous.)<br><br>Newman had some difficulty with his clandestine plan, though. His family home was serving as a boarding house, and several British officers were staying there. Newman managed to elude them by saying he was tired, going to bed, and escaping out a side window, like something out of a cartoon. His friend, John Pulling, helped him get the lanterns to the top of the tower while a third man guarded the church door. <br><br>Newman was later questioned about his actions that night – possibly because a twenty-something announcing he's going to bed early is inherently suspicious – but he talked his way out of arrest, and fled Boston. <br><br>When Newman returned to the city, he went back to his old job as church sexton. There’s evidence he took money to show tourists around the church crypt – including displaying the body of John Pitcairn. Which might have something to do with Newman being replaced by a new sexton in 1788.

When Paul Revere and William Dawes left Lexington on their way to Concord, they were joined by Samuel Prescott - a young doctor from Concord. Prescott was a member of <br>the Sons of Liberty, a natural choice for an anti-British night-time ride.<br><br>Prescott was in Lexington that night to visit his fiancée – I assume that’s who we saw run off.  He was intending to return home late – a happy coincidence for Revere and Dawes. Prescott knew the area well, so when the three men were stopped by British troops, it was Prescott who managed to elude his pursuers and reach Concord to sound the alarm.<br><br>Here's the strange thing - after that night, well, Prescott sort of disappears. I have a record that he may have died as a British prisoner in Halifax in 1777, but it's far from clear-cut. I suppose he could have left Boston with the British on Evacuation Day, but how he was captured and when - I have no idea.<br><br>And those are four words I never thought I’d say.

William Dawes Jr. was a Boston revolutionary, and one of the riders sent out to warn Lexington and Concord that the British Regulars were on their way the night of April 18th, 1775. The other rider was, of course, Paul Revere. While Revere took the route across the water to Charlestown, Dawes took the longer road across Boston neck. He arrived in Lexington shortly after Revere did.<br><br>Dawes was a tanner by trade. These days he would make a fortune in New Jersey, the amount of tanning that goes on there. And while he wasn't as politically active as Revere, he did wear a homespun suit to his wedding. Now, I know that doesn't sound intensely radical, but at the time it was quite a statement. At the time the rebels were trying to enforce boycotts of British products - like cloth -and encouraging people to Buy American. By advertising his suit was locally made, Dawes was putting himself firmly on the Patriot side of the equation. He might as well have worn a bowler hat and a mask with the King’s face on. Though that would have been weird at a wedding.

Molineux doesn't usually make the list of well-known revolutionaries, mostly because he didn't live to see the outbreak of the revolution (he died in 1774). He was, however, one of the major Whig agitators in the years before the war started - right up there with Samuel Adams, and John Hancock. <br><br>Molineux was a British-born merchant and supporter of the Patriot cause. As far as revolutionaries go, that makes him a bit of an outlier - British-born Colonists tended to be Loyalists. He was Anglican as well - and those congregations were decidedly British leaning. <br><br>However, you couldn't doubt Molineux's devotion to the cause. He was known for being something of a hothead. So much so that he threatened people with death when the violated boycotts on British goods. Seems a bit extreme. He’d have a bloody FIELD day on forums.<br><br>On the night of the Boston Tea Party, Molineux disappeared from the crowd outside the Old South Meeting House - though almost every other well-known revolutionary leader was there, still talking to the crowd. Molineux was, of course, supervising the dumping of the tea. For this reason alone, I am prepared to call him the most evil man in history.

Surry was a servant in the household of Samuel Adams from about 1765 onward. She was given to Adams' second wife, Elizabeth Wells, as a wedding present (because nothing says you care like “Here! Have a human being!”). However Adams was morally opposed to slavery and insisted that she be freed before she came to live with them. She was, and worked for the Adams family for nearly 50 years. Which would be so much less fun than working for the Addams Family.<br><br>(Incidentally, while Adams wouldn't own slaves himself, it wasn't something he fought particularly hard for during his political career. He did support anti-slavery measures in Massachusetts, but never forced the issue if it was going to cause friction between the states - getting along with other politicians was just so much more important.)<br><br>(I’m obviously talking about Samuel Adams, here – not Gomez)

Shao Jun is an Assassin from China, and one of the last Assassins to meet with Ezio Auditore before his death.<br><br>Jun was born in royal captivity during the Ming Dynasty. She spent her teenage years life as one of the favoured concubines of the Chinese emperor Zhengde. While not an ideal lifestyle – though I wouldn’t mind it, it’s better than digging ditches - Zhengde's taste for travel meant that by the age of 15 Jun had seen more of the world than most people of the era - which I suppose you might consider a bright side, if you try not to realise that even some cats had seen more of the world than most people of the era. <br><br>In 1521, the Assassin Order used the confusion surrounding Zhengde's death to infiltrate the emperor's compound and free some of the concubines, Jun among them. She immediately became an Assassin - but never forgot the women she'd been forced to leave behind.  Years later, she returned to the Imperial Palace to free the remaining concubines, only to find that they had been killed by Zhengde's successor, Jiajing.<br><br>Jiajing's response to the second attack on the Imperial Palace was swift and brutal, and caught the Assassins unprepared. The Brotherhood in eastern China was decimated. Shao Jun and her mentor survived, but were forced to flee Asia entirely. They travelled to Italy to seek the advice of Ezio Auditore - but only Shao Jun would finish the journey, arriving in Florence in 1524, shortly before Ezio's death.

Reginald Birch was a London merchant, the son of another London merchant (who, conveniently enough, also had the last name Birch. It seems it was one of those hard-to-put-your-finger-on things that ran in the family). <br><br>Birch started in business for himself at an early age. By the time he was in his mid-20s, he already owned several merchant ships, mainly dealing with the tea trade to the American colonies. That's pretty good going, seeing as by the time most people are in their mid-20s they don’t even own a shirt. I have him as part owner of the Providence, among others. Later in life, Birch also owned several businesses in and around London. He was a member of White's, which was a posh Gentleman's club in London - and generally a well-known and respected man-about-town.<br><br>From what I can tell, Birch met Haytham Kenway while working for his father, Edward. They were introduced at White's while Haytham was still quite young.  Birch would eventually take over Haytham's education - tutoring him while on a tour of Europe in the 1730s. From what we've seen in the Animus, it seems their friendship continued into adulthood - with them working together as members of the Assassins.

Haytham Kenway is a Templar who came to the American colonies  in 1754. From what we've learned, Kenway was sent here by Grand Master Reginald Birch, with a dual mission: establish his own Templar group to rival the colonial Assassins – and search for clues about artifacts related to the First Civilization. And when a Grand Master tells you to do something, you do it. Even if it’s just a Chess Grand Master.<br><br>Kenway didn't find the artifacts he was looking for. He did, however, recruit a small, dedicated band of Templars. He also attempted to forge a relationship with the Kanien'kehá:ka in the frontier, and one woman in particular, Kaniehtí:io. The two were briefly lovers – and however brief it was, it was enough, because Kaniehtí:io, unbeknownst to Haytham, ended up raising their son, Connor.<br><br>I'm guessing it was Kenway who became Grand Master in the colonies, and therefore the man responsible for the 1763 attack on the Colonial Assassins. That attack wiped out most of the membership and almost all of our records from that era. It's never been clear exactly what happened in that attack, or how Kenway managed to make it such a complete surprise. <br><br>In any case, I don't think I like this guy.

Assassin records indicate she was the daughter of the Iakoiá:ner, or Clan Mother, and from an early age was being groomed for leadership herself. <br><br>While many in her community chose to ignore the incursions by Colonists into the area, and growing tensions between the French and British, Kaniehtí:io was convinced that they presented a very real danger.  She began to argue to anyone who would listen that the village should take action, rather than staying silent - which was contrary to the will of the clan chiefs at the time. She refused to follow their orders to remain neutral, deciding to fight back in her own way and recruiting help where she could get it - including from Haytham Kenway.

Then, when he was a young boy, his father was killed during the first siege of Masyaf. Only shortly thereafter the Assassin he died to save committed suicide in front of the 11-year-old Altaïr.<br><br>With his parents gone, Altair looked to Al Mualim - the then-Mentor of the order - as a father figure. Al Mualim recognized Altaïr's potential, and took on his training personally. Altaïr reached rank of Master Assassin by the age of 25 - an unheard-of accomplishment. If there was an Assassin Book of Records, there’d probably be a picture of this fella on the front.<br><br>Altaïr was one of the best fighters in Assassin history - with an arrogance to match. After a disastrous mission in 1191 in which he broke the creed and very nearly let an Apple of Eden fall into Templar hands, Altaïr was sent back down to novice rank and forced to begin again.<br><br>As part of his rehabilitation, he was responsible for taking out the major players in the Templar order at the time, including the Grand Master Robert de Sable. Tragically, in the end he was also forced to kill Al Mualim, who turned out to be both a Templar, and corrupted by the influence of the Apple. After his mentor's death. Altaïr took control of the order, turning it into the secret - and world-spanning - organization it is today. <br><br>One of the things that made Altaïr such a deadly Assassin was something we now call "Eagle Vision", a kind of sixth sense inherited from the First Civilization. It allowed him to read his enemies and surroundings in a way that goes beyond what the human eye can see. Of course, you'll know more about that than me (I can't believe I just typed that) because it's in your blood, and that's part of why you're here. <br><br>Well, let's be honest. You knew you weren't here because of my enduring affection, or my warm and passionate cuddles.

Ezio Auditore da Firenze was a Master Assassin during the Italian Renaissance, as well as being an inheritor to the mysterious ability of "Eagle Vision", and one of your ancestors.<br><br>Ezio was something of a playboy in his teenage years, but his life changed in 1476 when his father and brothers were arrested and executed for treason. Ezio tried to save them - but the evidence clearing their names mysteriously disappeared in the hands of a family 'friend'. Instead they were hanged as Ezio looked on.<br><br>Ezio fled with his mother and sister to Monteriggioni, where he sought refuge with his uncle, Mario Auditore. While Ezio had originally intended to continue on and settle in Spain, Mario had other ideas. He was the leader of the Italian Assassin Brotherhood and spent the next several years training Ezio, and convincing him to help fight the Templars responsible for the deaths of his father and brothers.<br><br>Ezio spent the next decade assassinating his way through the Templar ranks, eventually cornering the Templar Grand Master, Rodrigo Borgia, in Venice in 1487. Borgia got away, but Ezio was able to recover an Apple of Eden, and was formally inducted into the Assassin Order. <br><br>After several setbacks over the next few years, Ezio travelled to Rome in 1499 to confront Rodrigo - who by then had become Pope Alexander VI.  After defeating Rodrigo (but sparing his life), Ezio opened a hidden vault under the Sistine Chapel. There he discovered a message left by the First Civilization, warning of a catastrophe that would threaten to wipe out humanity. (Yes, that would be the one we're facing right now.)<br><br>Over the next 20 or so years, Ezio worked at strengthening the Italian Assassin Brotherhood, and fighting the Templars (which is sort of what we do). One of his greatest accomplishments would be discovering a hidden library belonging to Altaïr, hidden under the former Assassin stronghold at Masyaf, and containing another message from the First Civilization. He retired from the brotherhood shortly thereafter - which is what we call 'ending on a high note'.<br><br>He was terrific at jumping, too.<br><br>Ezio died in Florence in 1524.

You may not think it to look at him how, but this man was once the Mentor of a powerful branch of the Assassins - the Colonial Brotherhood.  <br><br>Achilles' life before he was an Assassin isn't well documented – it seems that most of the records were destroyed when the Templars nearly wiped out the order in 1763. <br><br>From what I do have, Achilles was recruited in the mid-1730s and became a Mentor in 1746. He had a gift for both recruitment and organization, so before long was head of a crew of Assassins that spanned the colonies and much of the frontier. Achilles strengthened the ties between the order and the nations of the Iroquois confederacy, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka, though as far as our records show, Connor is the first Native American to actually become an Assassin.

Louis Mills is a deckhand originally from where we British somewhat optimistically call ‘Sunny Brighton’. He got his love of the sea from his father - who was also a sailor. He first took young Louis to sea with him at the age of 10, sailing from London to Boston on a vessel named the Windward. <br><br>As he grew older, Mills kept working as a merchant marine, travelling the world and gaining a reputation as a reliable and level-headed sailor. He joined the crew of Providence in 1752, staying with the captain and crew through a variety of hardships - though by 1755 he was thinking of moving on.

The son of a Boston rope worker, Harold Ring got his start as a young man, fighting on the city's docks. How magical. By the age of 19 he was earning money boxing for a local club - though at the time boxing was still technically illegal, what with it essentially just being two men hitting each other about the face and neck. By the age of 25 he was considered one of the best boxers in the colonies - certainly the best in Boston, an unofficial title he would hold until he was in his late 30s.<br><br>In 1745, inspired the publication of Jack Broughton's first rules for Boxing as a sport – what a masterstroke to have rules; boxers really are great thinkers - Ring founded the Boston Brawlers - the first legal club of its kind in the area. He was dedicated to making the sport safer for fighters (as safe as it can be when your job is to beat the stuffing out of someone, at any rate.) The Brawlers were a great success, and the organization operated in and around the dockyards for decades before moving to a new location in Beacon Hill at the turn of the 19th century.

David and Richard Clutterbuck were gunners in the Merchant Navy, starting in the mid-18th Century. According to their reputation, these two aren't averse to a friendly fistfight over pretty much anything -so if you're talking to them, try not to mix up their names. David is the older brother, Richard the younger. Oh. And definitely don’t try and be funny with their surname.<br><br>The Clutterbucks were a Dutch family, who moved to London when David and Richard were young. Their father was a dockworker, and so the two brothers grew up near (and in) the dockyards, running errands to pass the time and earn extra cash. They showed an early aptitude - an affinity, if you will - for fighting.  The two brothers joined a crew with Robert Faulkner on board the Stalwart in 1750 and working with him until he disappeared in 1753. <br><br>Unlike many who go to sea in search of adventure and treasure, the Clutterbucks' motivation was somewhat different - guns. They grew up hearing the stories of the sea, but it wasn't until they overheard a gunner talking about the power of his cannon, that they decided a sailor's life was for them.<br><br>(The sailor was not, in fact, talking about an *actual* cannon, but the impressionable lads missed it. Do you see what I’m saying? I’m saying he was talking about another type of cannon. A different weapon altogether. I’m saying he was saying his “cannon” had “power”. I’m using speechmarks to make it obvious. He had a powerful “weapon”. He “wielded” an enormous “penis”. Still don’t get it? Oh well.)<br><br>The Clutterbucks spent years travelling on various merchant and privateer vessels - almost always hiring on as a pair. They eventually settled semi-permanently in Martha's Vineyard, taking it as a place to rest between contracts before they would get tired of all the quiet and hire on to another crew.<br><br>I’ll explain that joke again later.

Amanda Bailey was a well-known and well-liked innkeeper in Martha's Vineyard around the time of the American Revolution.<br><br>She was born in North Carolina in 1730, the oldest of a large family. Her mother died when she was 14, leaving young Amanda to work and help care for her younger brothers and sisters alone.<br><br>Amanda first crossed paths with Robert Faulkner when she was a teenager - he was working for the United Company of Merchants, she was a bar maid - clearly a recipe for romance. They exchanged letters  - I suppose it was the texting of its day - which stopped when Faulkner disappeared from Halifax to join the Assassins. Sad face.<br><br>Despite reports that Faulkner had fallen overboard and was dead, Amanda felt that he was still alive - somewhere - and after several years she went in search of him. (Possibly so she could give him hell for abandoning her - but I'm speculating.) She never found Faulkner, and eventually settled in Martha's Vineyard, taking a job working in a local inn - which she later purchased.<br><br>Amanda had a born talent for leadership and organization. She was responsible for setting up the first school in the area - not to mention advocating for improvements to the docks to bring in more business. Her inn was a hub for gossip during the Revolution, particularly if you wanted the latest in ship movements. It will probably come as no surprise to you that she was a spy for the Patriots - but that's only been publicly known since 1919 when a box of her personal correspondence was found, including some coded notes in Benjamin Tallmadge's handwriting.

Robert Faulkner is probably the most storied members of the Assassin's navy - though he was never formally named to a position above First Mate.<br><br>Robert Faulkner was the fourth generation of his family to be a seaman (I’m glad I didn’t say that out loud) - but the first in his family to be recruited to work for the Assassins. He started off in the Royal Navy, but finding his career stalled (partly due to his inability to purchase commissions), he left to work for the United Company of Merchants.<br><br>In 1753, Faulkner disappears from the historical record, presumed dead - but that's because he joined the Assassins, as first mate of the flagship, the Aquila. <br><br>Faulkner was much sought after as a mariner - recruiting him was quite a coup for the Brotherhood.  He had a reputation for having a disciplined crew and an almost uncanny knack for avoiding trouble - not to mention predicting the weather. Whether through years of experience, or some other more mysterious ability (because I totally believe in those) Faulkner would know when a storm (or calm) patch of sea was coming in, and could use it to his advantage. Imagine that! A natural weatherman who could accurately predict the weather! The world would never see his like again.<br><br>Faulkner served on board the Aquila until it was nearly destroyed in 1768, always deferring when asked to become the captain - he never gave his reasons why. However, his love for the ship was quite touching - he had it towed to its location near Boston, despite doubts that it would ever be seaworthy again. Faulkner could have gone back to the sea aboard another ship, but didn't - he stayed close to the ever-deteriorating Aquila and took to drinking, which is where Connor found him.

Do you know how many one-legged sailors in history have gone by the nickname of "Peg Leg"?  Here's a hint - it's more than one. This guy wasn't easy to find. But for you - I make an extra effort.<br><br>Peg Leg started out as George Chilton, originally of the Massachusetts Bay colony. He signed onto a merchant vessel as a young teen, working mainly as a deckhand. By the time he was in his early 20s, he'd travelled the world several times over - probably logging more miles than your average jetsetter does today. (Too bad there were no 'frequent sailor miles' - he could've earned some free trips or some leatherette luggage tags.)<br><br>In 1732, Chilton was sailing on board the "Rachel" when the ship ran into trouble. It was due to arrive in Boston in June, but after it had been missing for 2 months, Chilton was found drifting on a lifeboat miles from shore, suffering from dehydration, and watched over by a single seagull. The Rachel itself was never found. To this day, he tells people they’re just “on a break”.<br><br>Chilton claimed to have no knowledge of what happened to the ship or its crew - but he considered the seagull a personal friend and kept it with him from then onward, despite the hygiene issue it obviously presented, and the fact that walking around chatting with a seagull made him look completely insane.<br><br>For a time he had trouble signing on to crews - not only because of his pet, but because he was considered "bad luck", and possibly responsible for murdering an entire crew. For several years he took work as he could find it, until the whole affair blew over. The ship disappearing affair, I mean – I’m not saying he had an affair with that seagull.<br><br>By 1740, Chilton was travelling the world regularly, but his leg was smashed by a cannonball in a run-in with a privateer vessel in 1747. After that he walked with a crutch - and later a wooden leg, hence his nickname.<br><br>While his claims of having met William Kidd are obviously false (Kidd was hanged in 1701), he's definitely sailed with some of Kidd's former crew - most notably Hendrick van der Huel, who captained the Octavius when Peg Leg served on it in the late 1750s.

Silas Thatcher was the nephew of a well-to-do London merchant who purchased a commission for him in the British Regulars when he was quite young. He was sent to the colonies in 1750, poor man, where he was posted at the defenses along Boston Neck.<br>  <br>You won't be surprised to learn that Thatcher had a mean streak - few men wanted to serve under him, which might be what led to him being posted in Boston in the first place. (Living in the colonies was regarded as something akin to exile at the time. Actually, come to think of it, not much has changed.) Men who advanced under Thatcher's command were noted for their cruelty - like his personal assistant "Cutter" - which even you might have guessed is a nickname, meaning 'one who likes to cut things - preferably people'. Not what I look for in a PA, but there you go.<br><br>At the time, pay in the army was notoriously bad, and soldiers would often pick up odd jobs in their spare hours to make ends meet (this made them rather unpopular in Boston, where unemployment was rather high). However, Thatcher found something he enjoyed much more - demanding protection money from merchants in Boston. Not only that, but he dabbled in theft, fencing stolen goods, and the slave trade – a real Renaissance man - capturing the local Indigenous people and selling them off to the highest bidder.<br><br>Which is what he was doing when Haytham found him.

The Abenaki nation originated in what's now northern New England and the southern Canadian Maritimes. Although suggesting they're only one nation may be a bit of a misnomer, since "Abenaki" can refer to numerous groups from the same approximate geographic area and language family (Algonquin, since you asked). <br><br>Although the various Abenaki would join together during crisis events (like when they were under attack from other nations) for the most part they had no central authority. That's probably partly what caused the encroachment of British Colonists on their land. The British liked to have formal governments they could negotiate treaties with – it’s just so much more civilised and sometimes there are canapés - so from the Colonists' perspective, no central government meant that the Abenaki had no claim on the land. Of course, they could have found out otherwise, but that would have taken work, and been complicated, and - perhaps most importantly - the Abenaki might have said 'no'.<br><br>While the Abenaki tried to remain neutral during the French and Indian war, they were quite literally caught between the warring British and French colonies, so some conflict was inevitable. For the most part, they sided with the French, who were less responsible for driving them out of their homeland. The lesser of two evils, I suppose you could say – though that’s a sentence I never thought I’d say about the French.

Also called the Lenni-Lenape, or the Delaware. Before European colonization, the Lenape lived mostly along the banks of the Delaware river in what's modern-day New Jersey and Pennsylvania.<br><br>The Lenape were one of the first nations to come into contact with Europeans - most significantly with William Penn, who founded Pennsylvania, which was a stroke of luck, given his name. While the Lenape relationship with Penn was mostly peaceful, when Penn died, his sons forced most of the Lenape off their land in a deal known as the "Walking Purchase".<br><br>During the French and Indian War, the Lenape sided primarily with the French, though some individual groups would later leave to join the British. In 1778, they were the first to sign a land treaty with the Continental Congress - agreeing to provide scouts to the army in exchange for supplies. I imagine they simply liked fine cheeses and onions. The newly-formed United States showed its gratitude by eventually moving the Lenape into isolated communities in Ohio and southern Canada. How wonderfully thoughtful.

At the time of the French and Indian war, the people of the Shawnee nation were mostly living in and around the Ohio valley - the territory surrounding Fort Duquesne. Traditionally, their hunting grounds had extended into Pennsylvania and Virginia, but they were being slowly moved from their lands by the advancing line of British colonization. Hoping to stop - or at least slow - settlement, some of the Shawnee entered the war, siding with their traditional trading partners - that is, the French.<br><br>By 1758, some Shawnee negotiated peace with the British in the Treaty of Easton. However, the treaty wasn't respected (and if you know anything about colonial history, you're probably sadly unsurprised by that), leading to another war - Pontiac's Rebellion in 1763. By the time the American Revolution started, many of the Shawnee opted to remain neutral, although some sided with the British - again hoping for help pushing back Colonists. <br><br>Unfortunately, the result was the same as many other Indigenous peoples - the Shawnee were forced to leave their lands, with the majority eventually settling in Oklahoma.<br> <br>Good lord. Settling in Oklahoma. As if their story couldn’t get any worse.

This was the army that George Washington led in the American Revolution, made up of various regiments supplied by the states. The army was officially established by the Continental Congress in June of 1775, shortly after the Siege of Boston began. In fact, it was formed specifically to deal with the Siege of Boston, which at the time was being carried out by the various militia who had fought at the Battles of Lexington and Concord. <br><br>The Continental Army was disbanded in 1783 after the Revolution was formally ended - possibly because people agreed the civilian militias were all the colonies needed to defend themselves - but possibly also because Congress couldn't afford to pay them. My money’s on that last one.

"Sons of Liberty" was the name given to a number of protest groups that formed to protest the Stamp Act - and stayed together afterward, organizing Anti-British rallies and enforcing boycotts in the lead up to the revolution. It was like a friendly club for angry men.<br><br>Although the groups would later become more coordinated, they started separately. 'Sons of Liberty' was the usual choice for a name because it was a popular phrase meaning "Colonist" at the time. As you might predict given the name, the Sons were mostly middle-class and, yes, male - merchants, lawyers, and politicians. Paul Revere was likely a member of the Boston group, to give you an example.  <br><br>The Sons (in all of the colonies) weren't above using violence and intimidation to get their way – who was? They threatened all of the Stamp Distributors into resigning - with the Boston group going so far as to destroy the local distributor's offices, and parade him through town before he quit in a very public - and likely terrified - resignation speech. <br><br>Given that, it probably won't surprise you to learn they earned a reputation for being the radical wing of the Patriots - rallying the people and sometimes losing control of them. A public protest in Boston turned into an angry mob that burned the governor's mansion, some groups of the Sons were also known to tar and feather British officials and sometimes Loyalists.<br><br>You know, standard good guy stuff. What a really terrific way to blow off steam.

Since the American Revolution happened in the dark days before there was an Internet - and even before telephones - organizing colonial opposition to the British was a little tricky. I don’t want to make you cry, but these clowns didn’t even have dial-up. The solution was to send out riders bearing letters to inform Colonists in other areas what was going on - these became known as committees of correspondence. (Correspondence being a fancy name for letters – if you did not know this I am amazed you have even read this far. Actually, I’m amazed you even can read this far.)<br><br>Samuel Adams created one of the first Committees of Correspondence in Boston in 1772 - in particular, he wanted to keep people outside of Boston informed about town meetings, so the governor couldn't invite only his friends to meetings. That would be less a meeting, more a dinner party.<br><br>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Adams' committee worked so well that everyone started doing it. Eventually all of the colonies had their own committees, focussed on presenting a united front against British-imposed taxes, and supporting boycotts of British goods.  <br><br>Really, Adams should have patented the idea. He could have made a fortune.

You might think of the Continental Congress as a gathering of boring politicians - which it was - but they were also responsible for organizing the Revolution and making decisions about the United States government, which also makes them rather dull.<br><br>Sorry – important. <br><br>I should actually say the "Continental Congresses", because there was more than one. The First Continental Congress was convened in 1774 in Philadelphia to oppose the closing of Boston harbor following the Boston Tea Party (part of the Coercive Acts). <br><br>All of the politicians had such a lovely time at their first meeting that they agreed to have another party just exactly like it - and why not? Everyone loves a party - right after the battles at Lexington and Concord. Being men of great imagination, they called this the Second Continental Congress. This was the Congress responsible for writing the Declaration of Independence, and forming the Continental Army with George Washington as its commander, so despite their lack of flair for titles they clearly had some thinkers among them.<br><br>The third Continental Congress was convened in 1781. It's sometimes known as the "Congress of Confederation" - and despite how mind-achingly tedious that sounds, they were responsible for forming a government for the brand-new United States. Since getting everyone to agree on how that government should work took some time, the Confederation Congress met over the course of 8 years ending in 1789, when the Constitution passed and they were replaced by the United States government.<br><br>Now, I’ve been in some long meetings, but 8 years takes the biscuit. I pity whoever was recording the minutes.

British Regulars were the foot soldiers of the British Army. You'll also hear them referred to derisively as "Redcoats" because of the red coats they wear as part of their uniforms (I'll bet you didn't see that coming) or “Lobsterbacks” because of their huge, deadly pincers. Or still because of the red coat thing, I can’t remember which.<br><br>Regulars in the colonies were notoriously underpaid, and many looked for work outside of their army duties to make ends meet. Of course, their room and board was paid by the government, meaning they could charge lower-than-average rates for their work. Since unemployment was high in Boston before the Revolution, you can imagine this made the Redcoats rather unpopular among people they were taking work from. That, and their huge, deadly pincers.

Grenadiers were originally the soldiers in charge of throwing grenades (hence the name). They were chosen for being tall, muscular, and fearless - not only did they need the strength to throw grenades far enough to actually injure the enemy - they had to be brave (or stupid) enough to stay in the front lines of battle to do it.<br><br>Grenadiers were also called upon to be fast, effective assault troops - helping with things like storming breaches during sieges. (You know, all the standard easy jobs that are likely to get you killed.)<br><br>By the mid-18th century grenades had fallen out of favour, but grenadiers were still regarded as elite regiments, called on to guard the right flank of their battalions - and still to do all the other dangerous work they'd gotten a reputation for.<br><br>An interesting note on the hats - they were made high and narrow so that as not to get in the way while you were throwing grenades (which is a good feature to have). Eventually, the miter hat became part of the standard dress uniform in numerous armies.  <br><br>It's also possible grenadiers just really dig the idea of looking like the Pope. History's mute on that point.

Hessians were German soldiers who were hired by the British to fight in the Revolutionary War. While 'Hessians' technically referred to soldiers who were from the state of Hessen-Kassel, it came to be a blanket term for all of the German mercenaries who fought in the Revolution.  The imprecision is easy to understand, of course. When a troop of German soldiers lines up and starts firing at you in a war, only the most misguided of geography nerds would stop to ask where they're from. So. Me, then.<br><br>Among the Hessian troops who were sent to fight in the American Revolution were at least 2 units referred to as "Jägers."  These were light infantry troops, known for being accurate marksmen. Accurate marksmen are very much the best sort of marksmen. The word 'Jäger' also happens to be German for 'hunter', and early members of the Jäger troops were mainly comprised of experienced foresters. <br><br>Again - 'really accurate gunmen who are good at fighting in the woods' is exactly the kind of soldier you'd want for a war in the American frontier. Unsurprisingly, this made Jägers the most feared (and respected) divisions of the Hessians.

Loyalists were Colonists who sided with the British during the revolution. They were also known as “Tories”, “Royalists” and “King’s Men” and probably also by their enemies as "those bloody arse-kissing ninnyhammers" (among other things). <br><br>While being a Loyalist might seem to you like 'the bad guys' that’s only because you know the Patriots won. It’s very easy to use history to look smart – even if you were subjected to the American education system (and ‘system’ is a strong word).<br><br>In fact, by some estimates as many as one in five Colonists were actively Loyalist – and many more tried not to pick a side altogether.<br><br>I expect the version of the story you’ve heard goes something like this: "The Loyalists were traitors who betrayed their fellow Americans to the British." That's a nice little fiction, since from a Loyalist perspective the opposite was true: the colonies were founded and owned by Britain, the Colonists were therefore British citizens, thus the rebels trying to disobey the king were the real traitors here. <br><br>Aha! You see? You’re a country of traitors! Try spinning THAT!<br><br>You’d also have to be pretty brave to be a Loyalist, particularly if the people in your community were Patriots.  Known Loyalists were frequently dragged from their homes, beaten, burned with candles, or tarred and feathered.  <br><br>That’s just in case you suffered from the delusion that the Patriots always took the moral high ground.

Patriots were Colonists who united against the British Government in the Revolutionary War. Although, at the time of the Revolution ‘Patriot’ was something of a negative term. What we call Patriots today were more likely to be called “Whigs” – or, if you were a Loyalist, “rebels”.<br><br>The Patriot motto was ‘No Taxation without Representation” – a great phrase for rabble-rousing, though a poor choice of catchphrase for, say, a gameshow host.<br><br>It’s also a phrase that requires a bit of unpacking for a modern audience (By which I mean you, Desmond) The colonies didn’t elect representatives to the British legislature, and because of the travel distance between Britain and America, and the distinct lack of aeroplanes, it wouldn’t have been practical. Instead Patriots wanted to be governed by representatives within the colonies. Of course, they did have legislatures already - but those were rather prone to being shut down by British-appointed Governors whenever they didn't behave properly (read: do exactly what the governor wanted). <br><br>It’s hard to know how many people in the colonies were Patriots, the best guess is between 40 and 45% of the population. The rest were either declared Loyalists, or people who decided to remain tactically neutral (probably a wise choice, given that both sides were known for seizing the property of their enemies).

This club was founded in 1770 by several trappers who earned their living in the area, including Simon Girty. The idea was to have cabins that would be a safe haven and warm place to rest for Colonists who spent the season trapping in this part of the frontier. According to their records, as many as two dozen hunters used the buildings at any one time.<br><br>Although it originally started out as just a shared cabin space, it quickly evolved into a more formalized society. Human nature being what it is, hunters would brag about their kills around the fire - and exaggerate. After the several brawls over who could claim the title of the mightiest hunter, society members agreed to start logging their kills in writing - though why they thought this would prevent people from lying is beyond me.  It didn't. Sad, really.<br><br>By the way, yesterday I caught a velociraptor.

I can’t say I’ve ever understood it myself, but grown men beating each other up has a long and storied history, going back at least to ancient Sumeria. <br><br>Modern-day boxing began its rise to popularity in the late 17th century.  The Boston Brawlers got their start in the dockyards around the middle of the 18th century, but in 1804 they moved into a gym of their own on the north side of Beacon Hill. There they benefitted from the wagering dollars of the wealthy socialites living on the hill’s south side, who enjoyed nothing more than watching poor people hitting each other in the face for their pleasure. <br><br>I expect if you impress them enough with your manly prowess they’ll give you something in return. Perhaps a toaster. Or a black eye.

Stephane Chapheau is a Boston militiaman, and served as a cook in the years leading up to the revolution.<br><br>Chapheau was born in what's now Canada - near modern-day Montreal. His father was a cook for the French army who was killed in the fighting at the Plains of Abraham. After his death, Chapheau took on work as a chef in Montreal, but moved to Boston in 1764. While his personal letters indicate he was looking for a less complicated life, he was just in time for the unrest that preceded the Revolution. Fortunately for Chapheau, he didn't actually want a quiet life - and as it happened, the tensions in pre-Revolution Boston suited him exactly. Which is weird, because who enjoys tensions? Apart from a scientist studying surface tension as an effect of intermolecular attraction!!!<br><br>Give me a minute to stop laughing.<br><br>Chapheau was a man in search of a cause, and he found it in the Patriots. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Sons of Liberty - participating in their 1765 protests surrounding the Stamp Act. He was present when the crowds ransacked Governor Hutchinson's house in 1765 - probably egging on the mob. He was also one of the crowd that witnessed (and partially caused) the Boston Massacre. <br><br>Chapheau didn't limit himself to protests. I have several fines for him on the books in the 1760s and 70s for public drunkenness, and brawling - it seems he couldn't keep out of a fight when the opportunity arose - and in pre-revolution Boston, there was always an opportunity. It was a wonderful time to be an angry drunk – the world was your oyster.

Duncan Little was originally from Ireland, the youngest son of a large family, which is confusing, seeing as they were the Little family. He entered the priesthood at a young age, and was sent to Africa as a missionary in 1756.<br><br>Little spent several years in Africa, but in 1760 he returned to Ireland, leaving the priesthood entirely - I'd tell you why, but it seems that information is locked behind a wall at the Vatican and I'm not hacking into their records today as they seem to have changed their password from W3L0V3P0P3 again. The next information I have about him is as a passenger on a ship to Boston in 1763. From his letters, it seems his family more or less drove him away over his split with the Catholic Church. (Blood being thicker than water and all of that.) <br><br>Little settled in Boston's North End, where he gained a reputation as a good mediator - fair and less expensive than going before the local judiciary. When he wasn't spending time at the local pub, he was helping people to solve their problems - generally by talking them down from a fight, which seems to be all that really happened in Boston in those days. And by those days, I mean anything up to the present day.  Little was the first person people called when there was a scuffle, and his usual table at the King's Horse tavern was known locally as "Little's Court" - a moniker the British cracked down on in 1770. Because we like to ruin everyone's fun.

Clipper Wilkinson is a hunter and surveyor from Virginia. Actually, surveying and hunting are the family business. His father and brother are surveyors (and crack shots) as well - making the market in his small hometown somewhat oversaturated. Hell, making the market in his HOUSE somewhat oversaturated.<br><br>Wilkinson moved to New York looking for work - unfortunately arriving just in time for the opening events of the Revolution. He remained neutral for the first part of the war, but after seeing the cruelty of the Redcoats' actions in Boston, he started leaning toward the rebel side - putting himself at odds with the rest of his family, who are Loyalists.<br><br>It seems Connor has a talent for attracting friends with family troubles.

Deborah Carter was a courier in New York City at the time of the Revolution. She's the daughter of a merchant, Amos Carter, who was locally known for owning and bankrupting numerous businesses, and racking up significant debts.<br><br>Deborah was turned onto the streets at the age of 10 and took up work as an errand-runner, disguising herself as a boy to do it (hence the nickname 'Dobby'). Many of the tradesmen she worked for knew who she really was, but pretended to be fooled by the disguise. Possibly at first because they understood that her other options were limited, but later because she was quick, reliable and intelligent. <br><br>As a teenager, "Dobby" had to drop her disguise - but she kept her nickname. She continued her career carrying messages - and began negotiating contracts between businesses. She became something of a community icon - making sure the poor in the neighbourhood had food and clothing, and fighting against merchants who were charging exorbitant prices for staple items – a bit like Robin Hood, though when Dobby wore tights, no one giggled. And it was as a community icon that she met Connor.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm not being completely figurative when I say she was 'fighting' merchants. She wasn't averse to throwing a punch or two when it was necessary, particularly in her own defense - or the defense of others in her neighbourhood.

Jacob Zenger was born near the town of Mannheim, in what is today Southwestern Germany.  He's the son of a farmer, one of 13 siblings. (Seems like a lot by modern standards, but colonial families were large, and the sad truth is that only 4 of Jacob's brothers and sisters would survive to adulthood.)<br><br>Zenger's family was poor and his career prospects were limited in Mannheim. Following the promise of a better life, he signed up as a soldier.  After several years in the service, he was shipped to New York - one of the Hessians sent to fight for the British in the Revolution. <br><br> Zenger - like many of the Hessian troops - left the service after coming overseas. Eager to get back to the country, Zenger bought a plot of land and left New York. However, after a series of crop failures, he was forced to move back to the city, taking up the only career that he could find to pay the bills - working as a bodyguard.

Jamie Colley is the son of a New York dock worker - James Colley. History doesn't record the name of his mother, though the Assassin records note she worked on a plantation in the southern colonies. <br><br>As a boy, Colley spent 3 years as a student at the Trinity School, where he was reported to be a bright student, reading everything he could get his hands on - his instructors noted that he was destined for great things. (I know you're wondering: yes, your school's permanent record really is that permanent). However, after that brief period he disappears from the school's attendance rolls - my guess would be he left because he needed to start earning money.  <br><br>It seems Colley's prospects didn't much improve through his teenage years - I have records of him being fined for vagrancy several times, which is never the sign of a high-flier. After that, he worked doing odd jobs for various local businesses, finally ending up working for a local physician, where his intelligence was recognized as an asset. He worked for several years as the doctor's assistant, where he met Connor.

On the night of April 18th, 1775, British Regulars left Boston on their way to Concord to raid rebel weapons stores. The intent was to make a quick raid, defuse rebel plans to attack the British and capture instigators John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Unfortunately for the British, the result was the beginning of the American Revolution.  <br><br>In other words: this battle was a complete disaster for the British. And that’s not a sentence with which I’m a hundred per cent comfortable.<br><br>The rebels had been tipped off about raids weeks before - they'd already moved most of the weapons the British were looking for. The night before the battle, Paul Revere and William Dawes brought word that the British were on their way. So, by the time the Regulars marched into Lexington near dawn, the local militia was waiting for them. <br><br>Nobody knows who fired the first shot – the British blamed the rebels, and vice-versa - but in the end, the Lexington militia was badly outnumbered and retreated, and the British moved on to Concord.<br><br>By most reports, the British were polite in Concord, which I’m sure their mothers would have been delighted to hear about. All apart from one moment, of course, when John Pitcairn threatened a local tavern owner at gunpoint… but to be fair, the tavern owner DID know where the weapon caches were. <br><br>Overall, things didn't really go awry until nearby militia saw some smoke rising above the town - they thought it was on fire and marched in, causing a skirmish at the North Bridge.<br><br>By the time the British left Concord, more militia had arrived, outnumbering the Regulars, and raising tensions further.  The new troops followed the British along the road bravely firing at them from behind walls and the cover of trees. There was little the British could do to fight back - and they were tired, and mostly out of ammunition. Some of the regulars even broke ranks and fled.  For the rest - it was a long walk back to Boston.<br><br>Rather than dispersing after the battle the militia gathered outside of Boston neck, starting the Siege of Boston, and the beginnings of the Continental Army.

Bunker Hill was one of the first battles of the Revolutionary War. Technically, the rebels lost, but it was a pyrrhic victory for the British.<br><br>Let me set this up a bit: there were two places where rebel forces would have been able to mount attacks on British-occupied Boston– one was the Charlestown peninsula to the north, the other was Dorchester Heights, to the south. When rumours started that the British were going to fortify the hills around Charlestown, the rebels decided to act. <br><br>By which I mean do something; not put on a little play.<br><br>On the night of June 16, 1775, troops under the command of William Prescott sneaked onto the peninsula, occupied Bunker Hill and built fortifications on Breed's Hill. It was a tactically terrible choice – Breed's Hill was easier for enemies to climb, much more open to attack, and close enough to the British ships in the harbour to come under fire.  In fact, Prescott's orders were to fortify Bunker Hill – it's uncertain why he made the switch. Maybe he had trouble with B words, like Bunker and Breed’s. He probably thought he was fighting against the Belgians, not the Brits. <br><br>Fortunately for the rebel army, it seemed the British were almost as tactically inept as they were.  When General Howe landed troops at Moulton's Hill, he waited for reinforcements, rather than attacking immediately. This gave the rebel forces time to shore up their fortifications. When Howe finally did attack, he divided his forces, expecting the disorganized rebel army to fall before him – which it didn't. In fact, the British forces attacked and retreated twice before winning the day - after they'd received more reinforcements and the rebels were mostly out of ammunition.<br><br>The casualty reports are telling: 228 British soldiers dead, including many of their officers, and more than 800 injured. On the rebel side, 301 injuries and 140 deaths.  The Continental Army had shown they could hold their own against the better-trained British Army - and it's hard to say which side was more surprised by that. It still surprises me to this day.

This is one of many wars in the longstanding British vs. French rivalry. Well, YOU might call it a rivalry. I'D call it a battle of wits with an unarmed country.<br><br>This particular war being over who would come out as the Biggest Colonial Power. Of course, it wasn't enough that the British and French fight one another - they convinced a number of North American Indigenous nations to join the conflict as well, hence the name 'French and Indian War'. <br><br>The war started in the colonies but it spread to Europe where it was known as the "Seven Years' War". Before you point it out, yes, I know the dates add up to more than 7 years. The conflict started in 1754, but war wasn't officially declared until 1756. But well done for spotting it, you mathlete. I bet you were popular at school.<br><br>George Washington has the honour of starting the actual fighting - under orders, of course. He was sent to create a fort in disputed territory. While he was doing that, he crossed paths with a French patrol.  Washington attacked, the French retaliated. The British followed up by sending two full regiments of Regulars to the fight. And so it began.<br><br>The British fought a losing battle until about 1758 when they got a new Prime Minister, who decided funding the war effort was a priority. Possibly because of the whole French thing. Maybe he ate a bad baguette once. With the added support, the British - along with their Indigenous allies and the colonial militia - began to gain ground slowly but surely. Eventually, the French were driven out of almost all of their territory north of the Caribbean, something we in Britain celebrate with a special holiday, called “Every day, all year”.<br><br>So the British won - but they were left with huge war debts. They tried to pay these off with taxes levied from the Colonists they'd defended from the French, who would have had them all eating onions and saying ‘Oui sir, non sir’ before you knew it. The Colonists objected - leading up to a series of protests, which were part of the unrest that led to the American Revolution. Talk about gratitude. Zut alors!

This battle was part of the French and Indian War. In it, Edward Braddock's force of 1500 British Regulars and militia was decimated by a group of French-led troops half its size.<br><br>This is not something we talk about much in Britain.<br><br>Braddock had been sent to capture Fort Duquesne, at the top of the Ohio River. His officers included a young George Washington - possibly because Washington knew the area, having surrendered at Fort Necessity the year before.<br><br>Braddock's troops were about 10 miles from Fort Duquesne when they were ambushed by a group of French and Indigenous fighters. Braddock's advance troops were overwhelmed and fell back into the main body of the army. His rear guard didn't hear the order to stop, and kept advancing into the main body of the army. The result was chaos. Almost every one of his officers was killed - with the exception of Washington. Braddock himself was fatally wounded; Washington had him carried from the field and he died 4 days later. An interesting historical note - Braddock gave his officers' sash to George Washington, asking him to preserve it. Washington did - it's still on display at Mount Vernon.<br><br>The battle is also known as "Braddock's Defeat", but interestingly, no one knows why.<br><br>I’m kidding. Though if you need me to tell you why, I don’t think you’re really cut out for this.

The Boston Massacre was the culmination of several fights between British soldiers and the people of Boston. A group of British soldiers fired into a crowd at point-blank range, killing 5. <br><br>The reality of it is less damning to the British than it sounds - what started as an argument about a wigmaker's bill (of all things) turned into a mob.  Hundreds of Boston citizens kept 8 British Regulars cornered for hours. By the end of it, many were holding clubs, throwing stones, and taunting the soldiers to fire.  <br><br>Captain Thomas Preston was in charge of the Regulars, and tried to defuse the situation by talking with the crowd. They asked if his soldiers' guns were loaded - he admitted that they were, but it would have been stupid for him to order them to fire, since at the time he was standing in front of them.<br><br>It wasn't until one of the soldiers was hit by a stone (which forced him to drop his musket) that the Regulars fired into the crowd - against the orders of Preston, who later testified he never gave the command to fire.  (It's possible his men mistook the taunts of the crowd for an order.)<br><br>The Regulars were arrested and tried for murder - six were acquitted, including Thomas Preston. The other two men were found guilty of manslaughter, but had their thumbs branded in lieu of the usual sentence - which was death.<br><br>One of the interesting things about the massacre is what happened afterward - that is, how both sides tried to spin it to their advantage. The fact that most people call it a "Massacre" should give you some idea of who won this particular PR war. Revolutionaries portrayed it as an attack on Colonial liberties, and images of the event (popularized by Paul Revere), showed an organized British force firing into the crowd - not a confused group of soldiers cornered by an angry mob.  <br><br>The British, on the other hand, referred to the event "The Incident on King Street".  We're naturally calm in a crisis - unlike countries who insist on turning every minor confrontation into a three-ring circus.<br><br>Anyway, the wigmaker dropped his prices and it never happened again. <br><br>I call it a victory for the bald.

This was one of the key events leading up to the American Revolution. Protesters (some dressed in faux-Native garb) boarded 3 ships docked in Boston Harbour and threw their cargoes of tea overboard to protest British taxes. Throwing tea into a harbour probably broke a world record for making the biggest cup of tea ever, though if there is one statement guaranteed to rile a Briton, it is the unnecessary waste of perfectly good tea.<br><br>So - simple enough, but the lead up is a bit more complex. The East India Company actually wanted to sell the tea to all of the colonies at a cut-rate to boost its flagging profits. However, taxes on the tea would have to be paid to the British the instant the tea was unloaded in Boston harbour. And the Colonists had a long-standing problem with paying taxes to Britain when they had no representatives in British parliament. Offering discount tea while still collecting the tax on it was viewed by the Colonists as a trick to get them to agree to parliament's authority over them.<br><br>Protesters turned back ships carrying tea to New York and Philadelphia, and if that had happened in Boston, the problem would have been solved. Unfortunately, the governor of Boston wouldn't let the tea ships leave once they were in the harbour. I guess he figured the public would come 'round eventually and just pay the tax - because everyone likes a bargain - but that never happened. In fact, protests got bigger and bigger until a meeting at the Old South Meeting House. A mob broke away from the crowd there and dumped the tea, solving the impasse, and wasting the tea.<br><br>(I shuddered as I wrote that)<br><br>The British reacted to the protest by sending British troops under Thomas Gage to occupy the town. They also closed the Boston Harbour, part of several laws they created to punish the Colonists that were dubbed the "Coercive Acts". Of course, these laws didn't gain them any sympathy with the Colonists - and led fairly directly to the outbreak of the Revolution.<br><br>Tea is important business.

The Battle of Monmouth wasn't particularly significant strategically, but it was an important proving ground for Washington and the Continental Army. It was also a near-disaster. But I'm getting ahead of myself, and that’s naughty.<br><br>Once the British learned that the French had joined the Revolutionary War, British troops were ordered to withdraw from Philadelphia and march to New York City. That’s quite a march. I bet they couldn’t wait for the invention of the motor car. <br><br>The Continental Army was just finishing its winter at Valley Forge and George Washington was anxious to try his newly-trained troops.  He decided to attack the British column in an attempt to delay it - or stop it entirely.<br><br>Washington chose Charles Lee to lead the advance guard in the attack. At first Lee said no, saying that the British troops should be left alone. However, when Washington ignored his protests and offered the command to the Marquis de Lafayette instead, Lee agreed to fight.<br><br>Lee's troops caught up to the British column at the Monmouth court house, and attacked. The day was hot - more than 100 Fahrenheit - and soldiers on both sides dropped from heat exhaustion. Despite the weather, the Continental Army was doing well until Lee mysteriously ordered a retreat - a move that still confuses modern historians. People must have thought he was quite the pacifist for such a warrior. Though of course, people didn’t know what you and I know now… it’s nice to feel clever, isn’t it?<br><br>First time for you?<br><br>Anyway, Lee's plan backfired - Washington arrived to find his troops retreating, but rallied them and attacked again. The two armies fought until nightfall, when the British sneaked away under cover of darkness - leaving the Continental Army victorious, but the British Army well on its way to New York. Still, it was proof that Washington's troops were - finally - a match for the British.<br><br>The battle secured Washington's reputation - and destroyed Lee's.  He was arrested, court-martialed, and kicked out of the army entirely.

The Sullivan Expedition was Washington's response to several raids by British and Iroquois groups along the northern frontier. Forces under Joseph Brant and John Butler had attacked forts and settlements in the Wyoming and Cherry valleys - killing and scalping women and children as well as militia. <br><br>Washington's orders were very clear. In order to root out the problem, Sullivan was to attack and burn as many Iroquois settlements as he could find, and take as many prisoners as he could. Sullivan complied, burning 40 Iroquois villages, and destroying an estimated 160,000 bushels of corn. His troops also answered previous atrocities with their own - scalping bodies, and burning people alive in cabins.  Sullivan didn't limit his troops to active enemies, either - he also attacked the Onondaga, who had stayed neutral during the war. (This attack had the unsurprising effect of making the Onondaga into enemies of the Patriots.)<br><br>In the end, the Sullivan expedition failed to stop raids in the area - those continued throughout the revolution, as each side sought to get revenge for the violence of the other. The repeated attacks on both sides eventually laid waste to the entire Kanièn:keh Territory (also known as Mohawk Valley) and the land around it.<br><br>Possibly because of the Sullivan Expedition, George Washington became known among the Iroquois as the "Town Destroyer".  Although, the origin of the nickname is historically contested - he might have already earned it destroying towns during the French and Indian war. Now there's the mark of a great statesman - it's hard to tell when he got a reputation for scorched earth policies, because he did it so much.

In this battle, French ships under Admiral De Grasse held off a British fleet attempting to occupy Chesapeake Bay.  I know it doesn't exactly sound scintillating, but bear with me here - this was critical to the British surrender that ended the war. I don’t like to talk about it, but I will.<br><br>George Washington gave De Grasse a choice between attacking New York City (the British stronghold) or Virginia (Where British troops were stationed). De Grasse chose Virginia – the waters were easier to manoeuvre in, and he didn’t have the equipment that a siege of New York would require. <br><br>De Grasse was stationed in the West Indies, but left in secrecy - or he tried to. The British noticed his warships missing. I don’t know about you, but I’d find it suspicious if a bunch of warships went missing. It raises questions. And it wasn't hard to guess where they might be headed. <br><br>The British Navy sent ships to Chesapeake Bay to cut De Grasse off. However, they went the fast way, while De Grasse took the scenic route - staying out of sight and out of the major shipping lanes. So when the British arrived at the Chesapeake they found it… completely empty. They sailed on for New York to meet with the rest of their fleet there, leaving the Chesapeake Bay empty when De Grasse arrived at the end of August. Clever. And by taking the long way round, De Grasse collected enough Sea Miles to qualify for a free hip flask.<br><br>The British fleet returned less than a week later, but the damage was done. They were outnumbered by the French forces occupying the bay. I believe the technical term here is "Whoops". (There’s another one, but that begins with ‘F’, so I’d better not.)<br><br>De Grasse’s fleet sailed out to engage the British on open water. They fought for only two hours before night fell. It was the only time they would actually fire their guns. De Grasse led the British south, away from the mouth of the harbour, leaving time for French reinforcements to arrive from Rhode Island - and occupy the bay again.<br><br>Finding themselves badly outnumbered and outmaneuvered, the British returned to New York, effectively abandoning the troops they were supposed to supply in Virginia. <br><br>The battle was technically a draw. I’ll take that. However, the larger victory came when the British troops in Virginia realized they were cut off and surrendered - effectively ending the Revolution.

The Siege of Boston began right after the Battles of Lexington and Concord.  The Colonial militia who had gathered to stop the British raids followed the British army to Boston… and camped outside, bottling British troops and their Loyalist allies in the city. At the time, Boston was a peninsula, attached to the mainland by a thin strip of land known as Boston Neck. With this blocked, land access to the city was cut off.<br><br>The siege lasted for most of a year, with only one major battle - Bunker Hill. But - as with most sieges - it took a toll on the city of Boston. There were shortages, particularly of firewood, and many buildings were torn down to be used as fuel.  Of course, the British targeted any rebel-associated buildings for destruction. As a result, things like the Liberty Tree and the pews from the Old South Meeting House ended up inside a fireplace. <br><br>The siege ended shortly after the rebels attacked and fortified Dorchester Heights to the south of Boston - giving them the ability to fire on the harbour. Boston's governor decided to evacuate, rather than fight. On March 17, Loyalist ships sailed out of the city. <br><br>March 17 is now known as "Evacuation Day" and is a holiday in some parts of Massachusetts. The fact that it is also St. Patrick's Day is… mere coincidence. (Though it is said that in ancient Gaelic, “Evacuation” means “Drinking as many pints as possible and being sick in a bin”, so you never know.)

The Great Fire destroyed as much as a quarter of the buildings in New York, and caused a housing crisis that lasted as long as the British occupation of the city.  <br><br>New York at the time was largely deserted - first Loyalists had moved out as the Continental Army moved in, and then the Continental Army left and many of the Patriots went with it. Many buildings were empty, and the conditions were dry. So when the flames started they spread quickly, ripping through the poorer sections of the city and seeming to spread to several places at once. This is probably part of what caused rumours that the Continental Army was responsible - such a big fire couldn't have been an accident. <br><br>Except it seems it was.  There’s no proof that the rebels were involved at all. Washington had considered setting fire to the city as he retreated, but Congress had voted against it.  Washington was fairly clear in his writings about the event: “Providence, or some good honest fellow, has done more for us than we were disposed to do for ourselves." That is – ‘Wasn’t us! But I’m not sorry it happened…’

On the night before the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Paul Revere and William Dawes left Boston to warn the countryside that the British Regulars were on the march. In particular, they wanted to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams that the Regulars intended to arrest them.<br><br>Revere left Boston by boat across the Charles River, taking the road across the Charlestown peninsula. Dawes took the longer land route across Boston Neck. Revere arrived in Lexington first, but Dawes wasn't far behind.<br><br>Once they'd delivered their warning to Hancock and Adams in Lexington, Dawes and Revere decided to continue to Concord to warn people there of the coming raid. They joined up with Samuel Prescott, who was visiting his fiancée in Lexington. Prescott lived in Concord, and so knew the area well. Road trip!<br><br>The three men were halfway to Concord when they were stopped by a British patrol. Revere was captured, but Dawes and Prescott broke away. Dawes lost his horse and hid in a barn for several hours before sneaking back to Lexington, but Prescott reached Concord to sound the alarm. (Good thing they had him tag along).<br><br>Years later, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow would write a poem about the event, which rolled all of the riders into one – Paul Revere. Which is why everyone knows his name - and why Revere is so revered.

This was the site of the winter encampment for the Continental Army in 1777-78. <br><br>Valley Forge wasn't Washington's first choice of location. My first choice would have been the Bahamas, but apparently that’s quite inconveniently located. The valley was mostly uninhabited, and he felt it that would be easier to house and feed an army in a larger town. Congress, on the other hand, wanted the army nearby - keeping it between them (in York) and the British army (in Philadelphia). Valley Forge was close enough to Philadelphia to harass British troops there, but far enough away to prevent a surprise attack from the British. A life without surprises. What a thing to wish for.<br><br>Washington did have a point, though - the army had trouble getting supplies, and Valley Forge had no housing for the troops. And even though that winter was mild, it was cold for an army where a third of soldiers didn't have any shoes. Mild temperatures also meant it was damp, so disease ran rampant - thousands died.  <br><br>All of which makes Valley Forge sound like a complete disaster, but the astonishing thing is - it wasn't. The better-equipped soldiers took the patrols; the others built houses. Nathaniel Greene was named quartermaster and found supplies. They invented subsistence rations for themselves when food ran low. Baron Von Steuben and others arrived and began to drill the troops in military tactics and in basic camp layout and sanitation - helping stop the spread of the disease problem. <br><br>Far from being the catastrophe it seemed, Valley Forge is legendary today as the 'proving ground' of the American army. I imagine it would be of little comfort to those who suffered there. “Yes, you caught a terrible disease – but well done, you really proved yourself!” <br><br>The army emerged as a capable fighting force, though - winning a victory almost immediately at the Battle of Monmouth.

The Beggar's Opera opened in London in 1728. It's a musical - one of the earliest ever created. It was written by John Gay, a writer and friend of both Alexander Pope and Jonathan Swift, two of the prominent literary figures of the day. <br><br>The Opera was both popular and controversial.  Popular, partly because it was an excellent skewering of Italian Opera, which was very popular at the time. However, instead of complicated Italian songs, the Beggar's Opera featured folk tunes that the audience could recognise, meaning you could hum along even if you didn't know Italian. <br><br>It was controversial because of the subject matter. It's set in the Newgate prison, and the main characters are all criminals - who act much like the upper classes.  It was a sendup of the British nobility, including veiled criticism of the head of government - neither of whom traditionally have a sense of humour. I’ve never met a Queen who liked a knock-knock joke.<br><br>Actually, I’ve never met a Queen.<br><br>The Beggar's Opera was accused of being a "base form of entertainment", and - because its main characters were criminals - accused of causing increase in crime. It's nice to see that criticism isn't just for movies and video games. Bloody opera – corrupting our kids…

This treaty was meant to resolve ongoing land disputes between the Indigenous peoples and ever-encroaching Colonists.<br><br>King George III had established a boundary line in 1763, but it had no basis in reality. Colonists were already living west of the line when it was drawn – not to mention the land wasn't really the King's to divvy up (I'm sure that just slipped his mind – Kings can be notoriously forgetful, the poor darlings, when it comes to the rights of others…). <br><br>Members of the Iroquois confederacy met with William Johnson at Fort Stanwix to negotiate a new boundary line – on behalf of themselves and other smaller nations (like the Shawnee). <br><br>I use the term 'negotiate' rather lightly - in reality, the Iroquois didn't have much choice in signing the agreement. It was give away some of their land and achieve peace (at least temporarily), or fight a long and drawn-out war.  The question was only how much.<br><br>When the treaty was signed, it was … generous to Johnson to say the least - even handing over lands the British had left to the Cherokee earlier the same year. In fact, the Stanwix treaty was so controversial that the British-run Board of Trade ordered Johnson to renegotiate. He refused. <br><br>Johnson made a fortune speculating on land – I imagine this treaty was quite a windfall for him.

This is the treaty that ended the war between Britain and the United States. (Not to be confused with the Treaty of Paris of 1763, which ended the French and Indian War, or the Treaty of Paris of 1810, which ended the French war with Sweden. Paris loves a treaty.)<br><br>The fighting between American and British forces had mostly ended by 1781, with Cornwallis' surrender at Yorktown. This agreement formalized the end of the war, and declared the United States as a new nation, with the 13 colonies as 13 new states. <br><br>The treaty also provided for the release of prisoners of war on both sides, a return of seized property to Loyalists and Patriots alike, and an expansion of the boundaries of the United States. Of course, the reality was a bit more complicated – both sides refused to return property that theoretically belonged to the other, like a messy divorce and some easy listening CDs. And as to the offer of expanded territory - well, Spain had other ideas about whose land it was – as did the Indigenous peoples living there.

The Buttonwood Agreement is the precursor to the New York Stock Exchange. It was signed in 1792 under a Buttonwood tree on Wall St. – hence the name. Lucky it wasn’t a Monkey Puzzle Tree – that would not be a dignified name at all.<br><br>The agreement itself is fairly simple – 24 local merchants agreed that they would trade only with one another, and that they would take a 0.25% commission on whatever they traded.<br><br>And in case you're thinking 1792 is too early for there to be stocks to trade, it wasn't – the first war bonds were released by Alexander Hamilton in 1790, two years before, so you’re wrong, and should probably keep your opinions to yourself.

You may or may not have heard of this one.<br><br>This is the document in which the 13 colonies formally declared their independence from Britain Congress voted to accept the Declaration on July 4, 1776 – celebrated today as Independence Day in the United States. Contrary to popular belief, the document wasn’t actually signed on July 4 - the first signatures weren’t added until the Declaration was formally transcribed, sometime around the beginning of August - others were added as the delegates arrived in Philadelphia. By some accounts the final signature wasn't added until sometime in 1777.  <br><br>The Declaration, with its statement that "All men are created equal" and that they had the right to "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness" became an inspiration for other revolutions that came after it. Most notably the French Revolution - against the very government that supported the Americans in their bid for independence. Oops.

The Stamp Act was the British Government's attempt to recoup some of the money they spent during the French and Indian War by taxing the American Colonists - who theoretically benefitted most from it.<br><br>Parliament chose a Stamp Tax because it was simple, easily implemented, and the Colonists couldn't smuggle their way out of paying it. All papers - from newspapers, to legal documents, to lawyer's licenses - would need to purchase a government stamp to be used.<br><br>Colonists, however, didn't think Britain had the right to tax them at all, since there were no colonial representatives in Parliament (hence the snappy Revolutionary slogan "No Taxation Without Representation").  They also resented the suggestion that they were responsible for Britain's war debts - since the colonial militia had a huge role in fighting - and winning the French and Indian War.<br><br>Huge public protests were organized - run by groups who called themselves the "Sons of Liberty". Merchants declared a boycott of British goods. Perhaps most importantly, the people assigned to collect the tax were threatened and intimidated into resigning.  The Massachusetts Stamp Distributor was even paraded through Boston by the Sons of Liberty and forced to resign at the Liberty Tree.<br><br>No stamp taxes were ever collected and British repealed the Stamp Act in March 1766. But it wasn't an entire victory for the colonies. Parliament then passed something called the Declaratory Act -essentially stating that Britain had the absolute right to tax the Colonists and there wasn't anything the Colonists could do about it.<br><br>Nothing, that is, except start their own country. <br><br>I’ve always fancied doing that.

The Tea Act passed in 1773. It was an attempt by the British Government to prop up the British East India Company by allowing it to ship tea to the colonies directly from India - without having it go through Britain first. This made the tea much less expensive - even cheaper than the tea the Colonists were smuggling from the Dutch (to avoid paying British taxes).<br><br>The problem was that - even with the cheaper prices - the British government was still collecting tax on the tea. Meaning: buying the tea would run counter to the colonial "No Taxation without Representation" stance. <br><br>The move was seen as (and probably was) Parliament's sneaky attempt to get the colonies to unconsciously agree to one tax, in the hope of implementing others.  The Colonists didn't fall for it - and attempts to force the unloading of East India tea in Boston caused the Boston Tea Party – perhaps the worst tea party of all time. <br><br>It wasn’t even catered. You people are savages.

The Coercive Acts - sometimes called the 'Intolerable Acts' - were a series of laws passed by British Parliament in response to the Boston Tea Party.  Among other things, these laws replaced the elected Massachusetts Legislature with an appointed one, and closed Boston Harbour until the East India Company was reimbursed for the tea - which, let's be honest, was never going to happen. The Acts were a major blow against Massachusetts' economy and self-government.<br><br>The acts got their name because British Parliament hoped that the crackdown would 'coerce' the citizenry into behaving like good little Colonists, and stop the violent protests - lest the same thing happen to them. Unfortunately, the acts had the opposite effect - it made it easier for Whigs to argue for independence, and difficult for the Loyalists to argue that Parliament had their best interests at heart.<br><br>It seems nobody likes a bully.

TADEUSZ  KOŚCIUSZKO

Id: [0x00065D09]
WILLIAM KIDD

Id: [0x00065D0C]
More commonly known as Thaddeus Kościuszko – and even more commonly mispronounced – this gentleman was a Polish soldier who served as an engineer in the Revolutionary War. Kościuszko was the son of a Polish noble, and learned military tactics as part of his private schooling. He joined the Continental Army in 1776. <br><br>His full name was Tadeusz   Andrzej Bonawentura Kościuszko and while his surname may sound like a sneeze, but Kościuszko was in charge of founding and training the much-needed corps of engineers for the Continental Army. He's probably best-known for overseeing the fortifications at Saratoga, which were crucial to the American victory there in 1777. He also helped build the fortifications at West Point (the ones Benedict Arnold tried to sell to the British).<br><br> When the war ended, Congress promoted Kościuszko to Brigadier General – probably just so they could call him “Brigadier General” instead of attempt his name – but also clearly in recognition for his service. He returned to Poland, where in 1794 he led a rebellion of his own - now known as the Kościuszko uprising. He lost, and was jailed for 2 years in Russia before being exiled to France.<br><br>Get this - after he died, Kościuszko left some of his money to Thomas Jefferson with directions that it be used to free and educate black slaves. Unfortunately, Jefferson never bothered to use the money. It was returned to Kościuszko's heirs in 1852.

Captain William Kidd was a Scottish privateer-turned pirate, and the centre of numerous pirate legends.<br><br>Not much is known about Kidd before the late 17th century - even his year of birth is approximate. It's reasonably certain he's from Scotland, but that's about it. (Every good pirate needs a mysterious past.). Kidd first appears in historical records in 1689, when he's listed as captain. He was a privateer for Britain in the West Indies, before sailing for New York City where he lived for several years.<br><br>In 1695, Kidd was given a privateer's commission to hunt ships in the Indian Ocean, and headed for Madagascar - which at the time was a known pirate haven. Then Kidd disobeyed the terms of his privateer's commission, attacking ships in the Red Sea - no one is quite sure why, but I guess that’s pirates for you. They’re bonkers.<br><br>When Kidd returned to the West Indies in 1699, he found that he was a hunted man. He sold his ship - the Quedah Merchant - in Hispaniola, and headed up the coast in a new ship. Kidd knew he was likely to be caught, and wanted to have bargaining chips to secure his own freedom, so he started hiding treasure as he went. The idea being that he could later give away the locations in order to save his own skin. <br><br>Kidd was finally captured when he returned home to New York. He tried to talk (and buy) his way out of arrest, but it didn't work. He was hanged for piracy in 1701, which must have been so annoying.<br><br>As for Kidd's treasure, it's known that he buried some of it on Gardiners Island, off the coast of Long Island, New York - That part was eventually recovered after Kidd's death. Nobody knows what else he hid, but speculation still rages today over how much he buried, and where.

BATTLE OF YORKTOWN

Id: [0x00065E0F]
While small skirmishes would continue until 1783, Yorktown was the last major encounter between the British and the Continental Army - effectively ending the American Revolution...<br><br>In the summer of 1781, The British General, Lord Cornwallis, was ordered to secure a deep water port in Virginia. He'd chosen Yorktown, on the Chesapeake Bay and by the end of September his troops had fortified the city and were awaiting resupply from ships in New York City. (What Cornwallis didn't know was that the ships he was expecting for resupply had been defeated by the French navy at the Battle of the Chesapeake in early September. He could have probably done with knowing that.)<br><br>On the rebel side, George Washington had just secured the help of the French, and was anxious to put his new troops in the field. He favoured an attack on the British stronghold at New York - but, since he didn't have the troops or the equipment for that, he settled for attacking Cornwallis at Yorktown. (I'm sure Cornwallis would have been flattered by the news that he was second choice).<br><br>The main force of Continental and French troops marched to Yorktown near the end of September and began to settle in. By October 6th the trenches were built and the siege had begun. <br><br>The key to Washington's strategy was the artillery brought in by the French army. It bombarded the city for more than a week, wearing down defenses until French and Continental troops successfully stormed two redoubts outside the city on October 14. This put the artillery in a place where it could reach the city itself, and Cornwallis' defenses quickly crumbled under the onslaught. He surrendered on October 19th. <br><br>This fall of Yorktown essentially broke the political will in Britain to continue the war - it had become too costly. Parliament started peace negotiations, and British citizens began to stamp their tiny feet and practice their speeches about how the colonies were smelly and uncivilized and we didn't want to control them ANYWAY. <br><br>Yeah, stinky colonies!

Massacre on King Street.  <br><br>Doubtless our readers well know that on the evening of Monday last, a squadron of soldiers formed before the Custom House fired into a crowd of citizens, killing four and wounding many.  Our readers will expect a circumstantial account of the tragical affair; but we hope they will excuse our being particularly cautious as we should be, had we not seen that the town was intending an enquiry and full representation thereof.  However, some few facts appear to be established.  <br><br>Following upon an altercation between some lads of the town and a single posted guard at the Custom House, an increasing number of citizens came to that place and with heat shouted down the guard.  In like manner, a large group of citizens gathered in King Street.  Capt. Thomas Preston perceived from the Main Guard House his soldier in distress and left the Main Guard with a party of men with charged bayonets. The soldiers came, pushing their bayonets, crying, make way! They took place by the Custom House and, continuing to push to drive the people off pricked some in several places, on which they were clamorous and, it is said, threw snow balls and, perhaps, portions of ice. The crowd taunting the soldiers, shouting, “Fire! You dare not fire!” On this, and more snow balls coming, someone cried out, “Damn you, fire!”  One soldier then fired, and a townsman with a cudgel struck him over the hands with such force that he dropped his firelock; and, rushing forward, aimed a blow at the Captain's head which grazed his hat and fell pretty heavy upon his arm. However, the soldiers continued the fire successively till seven or eight or, as some say, eleven guns were discharged.  <br><br>By this fatal manoeuvre three men were laid dead on the spot and two more struggling for life; but what showed a degree of cruelty unknown to British troops, at least since the house of Hanover has directed their operation, was an attempt to fire upon or push with their bayonets the persons who undertook to remove the slain and wounded!<br><br>The dead are –<br><br>Mr. Samuel Gray, killed on the spot, the ball entering his head and beating off a large portion of his skull. <br><br>A mulatto man named Crispus Attucks, also killed instantly, two balls entering his breast, one of them in special goring the right lobe of the lungs and a great part of the liver most horribly. <br><br>Mr. James Caldwell, mate of Capt. Morton's vessel, in like manner killed by two balls entering his back. <br><br>Mr. Samuel Maverick, a promising youth of seventeen years of age, son of the widow Maverick , and an apprentice to Mr. Greenwood, ivory-turner; a ball went through his belly and was cut out at his back. He died the next morning. <br><br>Mr. Patrick Carr, about thirty years of age, who worked with Mr. Field, leather breeches-maker in Queen Street, wounded; a ball entered near his hip and went out at his side. Apprehended he will die.<br><br>And several others requiring surgery, suffering loss of blood, shattered bones and lodged musket-balls.  <br><br>Governor Hutchinson has exerted himself in an effort to quell the town. He has ordered the arrest of said Captain Preston as well as the soldiers involved until such time as an investigation and general ordering of the facts can be made.

Tea chests destroyed. A most curious and remarkable event took place on Griffin’s Wharf, Boston Thursday 16 December. <br><br>An assemblage of individuals dressed in buckskin with faces painted in the fashion of Indian natives convened at the wharf and proceeded to board the Dartmouth, the Eleanor and the Beaver in orderly manner. These Indians, or perhaps no, as was the general discernment of those who witnessed these events, equipped themselves with small hatchets, which they denominated as tomahawks. <br><br>These ships held within their cargoes chests of tea numbering three to four hundred. The commanders of the vessels had publicly declared that if the rebels, as they were pleased to style the Bostonians, should not withdraw their opposition to the landing of the tea before the following day, they should on that day force it on shore, under the cover of their cannon's mouth.<br><br>Once aboard, the presumptive Indians opened the hatches and made to take out the chests of tea and threw them overboard, first cutting and splitting the chests with their tomahawks, so as thoroughly to expose them to the effects of the water.  In about three hours they had thus broken and thrown overboard every tea chest to be found in the ships. During the time they were throwing the tea overboard, there were several attempts made by some of the citizens of Boston and its vicinity to carry off small quantities of tea for their family use. To effect that object, they would watch their opportunity to snatch up a handful from the deck, where it became plentifully scattered, and put it into their pockets. Some of these same were met with kicks and hooting by the presumptive Indians.<br><br>Earlier on this day, there was a meeting of the citizens of the county of Suffolk, convened at Old South in Boston, for the purpose of consulting on what measures might be considered expedient to prevent the landing of the tea, or secure the people from the collection of the duty. At that meeting, no satisfactory answer was obtained after enquiries were sent to Governor Hutchinson, and Mr. Adams concluded with the observation that the “meeting could do nothing further to save the country.” <br><br>Beyond the chests of tea, there was no damage done to any of the ships. The destroyers of the chests were seen to sweep the decks clean of tea leaves after the chests had been thrown to sea.

The raising of the militia.<br><br>The recent events, as tumultuous and striking as they are, cannot have earned victorious wreathes had it not been for the efforts of some few riders that gave warning to the towns and raised the minutemen to their duty.<br><br>These riders, chief among them Mr. Paul Revere and Mr. William Dawes, were sent out by Dr. Joseph Warren, who had come into the knowledge by sources undisclosed that a regiment of soldiers was to march that night to Lexington, there to arrest leaders of the Sons of Liberty who were there spending the night.  The Regulars were then to continue to Concord to secure various arms there hidden about, including at Barrett’s Farm.<br><br>Dr. Warren could not risk that his message would fail to be delivered among the townships. He cleverly made fast certain of his aim sending his message by diverse routes at once. To begin, Mr. Dawes left Boston by way of Boston Neck, using guile to pass the roadblock and continue through Roxbury in a circuitous route. Soon after, Mr. Revere entreated Capt. Pulling to light lamps in the tower of Old North, this being the signal to Charlestown that the Regulars were on the march. Revere himself took the chance of a life to row beneath the prow of HMS Somerset to arrive at Charlestown himself and make the ride to Lexington directly.  Revere altered his route to evade the night patrols along the way. In the event, both riders haply arrived at Lexington to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock of the approaching Regulars.  Joined by Samuel Prescott, Revere and Dawes rode on to Concord but were confronted by soldiers on that road. Dawes lost his horse and made his way back to Lexington on foot. Prescott led his horse to a daring leap of a wall and continued on to Concord to raise the Minutemen.  Revere was captured by the patrol and threatened with his life.  He only secured his freedom when the soldiers heard fire from the hills of Concord and ran to join battle. <br><br>But Mr. Revere’s adventure was not yet complete.  Upon return to Lexington, he was astonished to find John Hancock at the place, preparing to fight the on-coming soldiers as an officer. It fell to Revere to ‘suade Mr. Hancock that his place was not in the field. Mr. Hancock and Mr. Adams then removed themselves to a safer place, but failed to bring along a chest full of congressional papers, of which the discovery by the soldiers would cause difficulties.  Mr. Revere returned to take possession of these papers before the soldiers arrived at Lexington Green.

Regulars confront militia. Shots fired.<br><br>Americans! forever bear in mind the BATTLE of LEXINGTON! where British Troops, unmolested and unprovoked wantonly, and in a most inhuman manner fired upon and killed a number of our countrymen! The events, as well as can be discerned, transpired thusly: Alerted by messengers that a regiment of Regulars was en route through Menotomy to destroy caches of munitions in Concord & vicinity, Militia forces convened, drawing members from as far away as Sudbury, Acton, Lincoln and Bedford.  The first such force stood against the Regulars on Lexington Green, just 7 miles from Concord proper.  Commanded by Captain John Parker, the Colony Militia, numbering some few dozens of members, stood ground as a brigade under Major Pitcairn marched in column along the Concord road. Accounts of what ensued remain confused, but Militia members claim that they never fired any shot, but were fired upon by the Regulars suffering them 8 deaths and a number of wounded. Capt. Parker led his men from the field and the column of murderous Regulars continued to Concord. <br><br>At the town of Concord another brigade of Militia, under command of Col. James Barrett, saw fit to fall back across the North Bridge as the Regulars numbered a much larger force. Atop a hill, Barrett watched the Regulars search for munitions and was gladdened by the addition of Militia forces arriving from diverse townships. In short order, Col. Barrett discovered that he outnumbered the small force of Regulars sent to secure the bridge and commenced to march upon them. Some few of these endeavored to dislodge planks of the bridge to delay the advance of the Militia, but were called off by their superiors.  Volleys were exchanged and men on both sides fell, resulting in the Regulars quitting the field. The larger Army force concluded its fruitless search and turned toward Boston, only to meet with a series of flanking manoeuvres and attacks in formation by the Militia. This force would certainly have been entirely destroyed had it not been for Brig. Gen. Percy’s arrival with reinforcements to escort them back, through hails of musket balls, to Charlestown.<br><br>Thus have shots been fired between ourselves and our cousins from across the sea. The Rubicon has been crossed. Americans!--Liberty or Death! -- Join or Die!

A Second Continental Congress.<br><br>In light of the bloody events in Massachusetts, a Second Continental Congress representing all 13 colonies has convened in the city of Philadelphia. The Congress will attempt to order the military situation in accord with agreement among all the Colonies.  It will seek as well to center parlays with London in one place and with all colonies in unison.  The Second Congress will be presided over by John Hancock of Boston as Peyton Randolph is not in good health and cannot continue his duties from the previous such congress.<br><br>In these few months since the glorious battles at Lexington and Concord, the military effort has been ad-hoc. Various Militias have driven out Tory officials and seized Royal munitions.  Thereunto, the first accomplishment of the assembled representatives has been to create from the several Colony Militias a single Continental Army and to name a General to lead it. Geo. Washington of Virginia, who saw considerable duty in the French War, is to be Commander-in-Chief with Artemas Ward, Charles Lee, Philip Schuyler and Israel Putnam as majors-general. Congress has also exerted itself in the mercantile interests of the thirteen colonies – all American ports are now open mooting the odious Navigation Acts.<br><br>Despite the creation of the Continental Army, the Congress expects that the division between all colonies and the Crown to be eventually be set right to the benefit of all.  To this end, the Congress has approved the Olive Branch Petition to the British Crown in a gesture of reconciliation.

Bloody battle in Charlestown!<br>  <br>Colonial Militia engages Crown forces on Breed’s Hill.  Many killed and grievously wounded.<br><br>It having become known that Crown forces intended to take positions dominating the whole of Charlestown, Gen. Artemas Ward put one thousand Militia troops into the field. Acting with bravura and dispatch, Maj. Gen. Israel Putnam and Col. Wm. Prescott worked through the night to erect a redoubt running the width of Breed’s Hill down to the Mystic River itself, said defenses surprising the Royal troops at morning light.<br><br>The Colonial Militia continued to build breastworks even as they were bombarded by ships in Boston Bay. Come afternoon, some two thousand soldiers, comprised of fusiliers, light infantry and regulars, landed on the Charlestown shore and assaulted the colonial defenses.  Militia snipers inflicted harm upon the Regulars from afar, and Gen. Howe responded in a most cowardly manner, ordering combustible shells to be fired upon the houses of Charlestown itself, setting the town on fire. The inhabitants fled to the fields.<br><br>The brave Militia, although short on rum and ammunition, held their ground and waited till the approaching line was well within range before unleashing a devastating volley into the Royal ranks.  The Army fell back then attacked again.  Again the New England volunteers inflicted great harm upon the soldiers.   From across the Charles, citizens of Boston viewed the battle from their rooftops.<br><br>A third time, the Royal forces marched up the slopes of Breed’s Hill. Alas, the Militia reserves of ammunition were exhausted and the men fell back in disarray, leaving both Breed’s Hill and Bunker Hill to the King’s troops.<br><br>The ground was hard won by Gen. Howe.  In all he suffered some one thousand casualties, dead and wounded. Militia losses are tallied at four hundred.

Fire devastates Manhattan. Trinity Church burned. Rebels thought responsible.<br><br>A great fire spread through New York on the 21st, that being Saturday before last.  The fire began near Whitehall Slip, likely in the Fighting Cocks Tavern known for untoward behavior.  A south-westerly wind quickly spread the flames north through the streets, putting many out of their homes.  These citizens took what goods they could and found relative safety on the town commons. The wind then shifted and burned most of the city from Broadway to the Hudson. Burning ashes from shingles were carried by the winds across street and to far buildings.  The roof of Trinity Church soon caught fire and the Church burned in minutes.<br><br>With little fire department left in the city, Royal soldiers essayed to put out the flames, but these efforts were largely ineffective, and the fire raged through the night.  Happily, St. Paul’s Chapel was saved by volunteers bringing buckets of water to drench its roof. <br><br>Very near five hundred homes and buildings have been destroyed.<br><br>Those responsible for the fire are unknown; however, it is no mystery that the Rebels would wish difficulties for the Kings soldiers, who have so recently and valiantly taken hold of the city. An investigation has been begun by General Howe.

Liberty! Congress unanimously declares the United Colonies free and independent states!<br><br>Yesterday, the representatives of all thirteen colonies resolved and declared the independence of their citizens and formally dissolved all ties with Britain. This Declaration of Independence, as it is so entitled, was drafted by a committee of authors, principally Thos. Jefferson, John Adams and Benj. Franklin and expresses in language more eloquent than we are able to describe the events and reasoning that have led to this final disruption. <br><br>The Second Constitutional Congress began work on this document months ago, some few among the representatives had every aspiration that the colonies would reconcile with the King and reasonable rights secured. With each additional regiment dispatched to these shores, that hope diminished until all voted in unanimity to severe ourselves from our Mother country.<br><br>John Adams declares that this day should be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, form this time forward forever more.

Continental Army suffers deprivations.<br><br>Encamped a scant twenty miles from Philadelphia, Gen. Washington’s army struggles in harsh winter. After the defeat at Brandywine, the Continental Army suffered humiliation as Congress fled Philadelphia in advance of Royal troops. The Redcoats subsequently marched upon and occupied our patriot capitol. Soon after, miseries were increased with the lamentable defeat at Germantown.<br><br>Gen. Washington has now located his army at a place called Valley Forge south of the Schuylkill River where the high ground of Mounts Joy and Misery provide for easy defense.  However, the Patriots must contend with starvation and want of clothing and shelter. Indeed, the General has set them to the building of huts with logs. He promises twelve dollars to reward the party in each regiment which finishes their hut in the quickest and most workmanlike manner.<br><br>But under several inches of snow, the soldiers are hard pressed to complete their task. The lack of food and clothing has led to outbreak of disease, with many succumbing to dysentery and typhus. Indeed, hundreds have died among the some eleven thousand troops. Only their undiminished loyalty to the cause of independence and to Gen. Washington himself has kept them alive.<br><br>The arrival of military adviser Frederick von Steuben to drill and train the men in correct formations and maneuvers as well as the considerable number of wives and children that have joined the camp and who forage for food and wood have considerably enlivened the general morale.

Pitched Battle at Monmouth Courthouse!  Continental Army pursues Royals.<br><br>The British army commanded by Lt. Gen. Henry Clinton having evacuated the city of Philadelphia and on the march to join British forces in New York City, was pursued and engaged by Gen. Washington and his men numbering some eleven thousand men on 28 June. <br><br>The British column was laden with a train of supplies, artillery and Tory citizens from Philadelphia. General Washington discerned an opportunity to attack an ungainly formation and left his encampment at Valley Forge to do so. The Continental Army caught up with the British in the environs of Monmouth. Washington, attempting to disrupt the column and gain time for the bulk of his army to arrive on the scene, gave command of his forward units to Maj. Gen. Charles Lee with orders to attack the column and cut it in half. This paper has learned that Lee was not in accord with the plan and initially refused command. Once he did take command, it appears that no proper orders were given to Lee’s commanders. They proceeded will-he nill-he and soon engaged in undisciplined skirmishes the British rearguard. Perceiving the disarray, Lee ordered a general retreat and was pursued by the Redcoats.<br><br>Lee’s men retreated in confusion directly into Gen. Washington’s advancing column.  We are told that the good General uttered considerable strong oaths, a practice contrary to his nature, and ordered Lee to the rear before setting to rallying Lee’s men himself. The Continentals then engaged Clinton’s forces in full with Lee’s men given to the command of La Marquise de Lafayette.  The American forces, fighting with discipline and order thanks to the efforts of Baron von Steuben, proved a match for their red-coated adversaries. At sundown, the Americans held the field, although Washington wanted to continue the fight.  Darkness saved the British further losses!<br><br>As of this writing, Gen. Chas. Lee is under court-martial in Englishtown. It is expected he will be relieved of his command.

As readers of this paper have learned, a French fleet under Adm.  de Grasse had recently sailed from the Caribbean to blockade the English force under Gen. Cornwallis at Yorktown. On Wednesday last, Sept. 5, a British fleet arrived numbering some 19 ships of the line. The French fleet, said to number over twenty, promptly sailed out to engage the British. <br><br>This writer observed from a precipice as the two fleets engaged in the distance.  It was clear that the French were having difficulties maintaining battle order. Their center lagged behind providing a clear opportunity to the British to attack and disrupt them.  But the British Admiral, said to be Adm. Graves, made no such attempt.  A gentlemen nearby made use of a spyglass and exclaimed that the British ships were allowing the French to close line and establish proper formation. Indeed, we all marveled at this. Instead the British rear lagged behind in turn and never engaged on this day. <br><br>The two fleets sailed east, in line against one another, this giving advantage to the French, who could open their hatches and fire from both gun -decks.  The English could not, as the pitched waves would swamp them if their lower-gun deck hatches came open, and thus their 32-pounders could not be brought to action. <br><br>The British took the greater damage, but the battle appeared a stand-off. However, this also favored the French, as their blockade remained intact. This very morning, the French have reinforcements in the person of Adm. de Barras with 7 additional ships of the line.  Reports are that Adm. Graves has set sail and is most probably returning to New York.<br><br>The blockade is thus maintained as infantry and artillery commanded by Gens. Washington and Rochambeau look to besiege Cornwallis.

Stunning victory!  Gen. Washington surprises Hessian force at Trenton.<br><br>Hundreds of prisoners taken.<br><br>In a daring raid, Gen. George Washington has in one coup overcome months of reversals and achieved a marked victory. In the teeth of highly difficult conditions, the General was able to assemble some thousands of troops and ford a Delaware River encumbered by floes of ice. In fact, large numbers of his force were unable to complete the crossing, leaving the good General with less than half the troops expected for his raid.  Nonetheless, the Continental Army marched through snow and sleet toward the garrisoned Hessian town of Trenton. Many of the troops were without boots and were therefore forced to tie rags about their feet and to march through the snow thus, leaving dark tracks of blood as a marker to their determination.<br><br>In Trenton, the Americans surprised a Hessian force of 1,500 groggy with sleep.<br><br>The main American force under Washington entered Trenton from the north-west. He sent Gen. Sullivan around the town to attack from the south and set additional forces in a position to the north-east, forestalling a Hessians retreat.  The Hessians made a hasty attempt to form line in the town but were under artillery fire from Capt. Alexander Hamilton as well as attack from front and rear from Washington and Sullivan. Soldiers joined with inhabitants of the town to shoot from house windows upon the Hessian gunners. During this fire-fight, the commander of the garrison, Col. Rall was direly wounded.  His troops retreated to an apple orchard and shortly thereafter surrendered. Nearly nine hundred Hessian troops were taken captive.<br><br>In the fight, Lieutenant James Monroe was wounded, but not grievously.<br><br>Some days before this expedition, Thos. Paine’s pamphlet, The Crisis, was read aloud to these same men.  Mr. Paine begins with the phrase: “These are the times that try men's souls, “and notes that “the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.” <br><br>Col. Rall died from his wounds before the conflict’s end.  A message was found folded in his pocket, warning him of the American approach. A warning he fatally ignored.

Benedict Arnold – Loyal to the Crown!<br><br>Surprising his Rebel colleagues, Gen. Benedict Arnold has made a brave attempt to bring an end to continued hostilities.  Having obtained command of the Fort of West Point, Gen Arnold met secretly with Maj. John André, an intelligence officer of the King.  It is difficult to obtain the true nature of the agreement they had in an affair of such emotion, but it appears that they concluded upon a transfer of some funds to Arnold in exchange for West Point itself.  Many have pointed to these funds as evidence that Arnold was interested in coarse gain, yet a man of such valor can hardly be suspected of such motives! Rather, it appears that Arnold was made aware of the pecuniary embarrassment he would suffer once his commission as a Rebel officer was lost, and merely took practical steps to protect himself and his wife from penury. <br><br>Indeed, Gen. Arnold`s wife, Peggy, appears to have played an active part in his loyalist turn. Several reports have surfaced indicating that it was she who first contacted Maj. André as she had known him for some years. <br><br>Sadly for the Crown, the plan unraveled.  After meeting with Arnold, Maj. André cleverly disguised as citizen Mr. John Anderson, was captured by the Rebels. They discovered various papers on him leading to his arrest.    Owing to being dressed as a civilian when captured, this man who took such risks for his King was therefore hanged as a spy.  Rest he in peace.<br><br>Happily, Arnold was warned in time and was able to effect an escape. We are told that he has been awarded a commission in the British Army and we await to hear greater exploits of him in future!

Daniel Boone was an excellent explorer and hunter, with a knack for talking himself out of trouble. I imagine he and his friends will have some fascinating stories to tell.  I wouldn’t mind hearing them from the primary source, myself - later authors were known for adding ridiculous embellishments, like the one about Boone killing a bear with his bare hands, or swinging through the forest on vines, or the one where he modified a silver sports car to travel back in time and ended up kissing his mum, though that might have been something else. <br><br>Boone and his friends travel all over the frontier, so they’ll be able to tell you if there’s any news you should know about.

CHURCH RESIDENCE

This house was built in 1707 by a prominent local merchant named Robert Calef. Benjamin Church bought it from his heirs to use as a Boston residence. Church’s practice is on Newbury street, a fairly short walk away, so the house was in an ideal location. It’s also in a nice part of town – even in Colonial Boston two-storey houses with fenced-in gardens don’t come cheap, and they didn’t even get cable.<br><br>Actually, given the location it seems that Church’s practice was doing very well indeed. That, or he had another source of revenue.

THEATRE ROYAL

Id: [0x00067BB6]
You might hear this referred to as “Covent Garden” (which it faces) or the “Royal Opera House” (which it later became). However, this is the original Theatre Royal building – opened in 1732, destroyed by fire in 1808.  It will be rebuilt – then destroyed by fire again in 1857 – and then almost completely renovated in the 1990s. They’ve installed a smoke detector this time.<br><br>The original theatre lineup was varied, containing ballet, operas, even acrobatics. Many of Handel’s operas opened here, right up until his death in 1759, when he mysteriously stopped writing them. But the building was mainly used for presenting plays, at least for the first hundred years of its history. The reason? It held the exclusive rights to perform spoken drama in London – awarded by King Charles II. Yes, kings could do that. Though why they would is beyond me.

DAVENPORT HOMESTEAD

This lovely little collection of buildings was the headquarters for the original Assassin Order of the Colonies- a modest Masyaf, if you will. Sometime during the Seven Years War the Templars made their move and destroyed it during their Assassin witch hunt. By which I mean there was a witch hunt for Assassins, not that there were Assassin Witches.<br><br>Achilles survived the attack and stuck around to keep the manor standing...barely, by the looks of it. Once Connor came along it flourished again for several decades, even surpassing its former glory. Then it suddenly vanished early in the 19th century.  Any manor that can suddenly vanish is both interesting and unsettling in the same measure, though probably not a great investment.

Originally, Lexington's meeting hall didn't have a steeple for a bell, so a separate belfry was built to summon people to church services, funerals, fires – and of course, to British soldiers trooping into town to raid Patriot weapon caches.<br><br>The belfry originally stood on a hill near the town, but was moved to this location in 1768 - possibly because nobody found it fun to climb a big hill just to ring a bell.

The night before the battle at Lexington, the town militia met on the Lexington common to wait for British troops. They eventually moved into this tavern, which was a popular stopping place after training exercises. Militia members were given free beer to encourage them to show up, because freedom fighters are at their sharpest and best after six pints and a packet of nuts.<br><br>Just before dawn the soldiers went back onto the common to meet the British forces. No one knows who fired the first shot, but some accounts say it came from "the corner of a house to the right of the church" - namely, Buckman tavern. Classic pub fight.

NORTH BRIDGE

This was the site of one of the first skirmishes in the Revolutionary War. During the battle at Concord, about 90 British soldiers held this bridge while several hundred rebel militiamen gathered on the hill nearby.  The British were expecting resistance from disorganized farmers, so when the rebels advanced in a “very military manner”, the British panicked. Angry farmers are terrifying at the best of times. Officers gave conflicting orders, the British formations broke and the soldiers ran away. <br><br>The original bridge was torn down in 1788 and a new bridge was built nearby. Of course, it’s been rebuilt several times - the image of the British turning tail is excellent fodder for historical re-enactments, which Americans enjoy re-enacting, but which never seem to be re-enacted on our side of the Atlantic. Strange, that.

JOHNSON HALL

Sir William Johnson built Johnson Hall in 1763. Well, I say "he" built it. He had more than a little help. He had 60 slaves to do the manual labour, making him the biggest slaveholder in the north. The property is more homestead than house - there was a sawmill and a grist mill on the property, and tenant farmers worked the lands.<br><br>The exterior is wood painted to look like stone, which is always a classy look, but the block houses you see on either side are actual stone, meant for defense. When the house was built, the French and Indian war had just ended, so it made sense to have the house ready for an attack. That, or William Johnson made some well-armed enemies in his business dealings.

ISAAC POTTS HOUSE

This was George Washington’s headquarters during the winter of 1777. The house was owned by Isaac Potts. It’s a simple country house, in the ever-popular Georgian style.<br><br>The President of Congress wrote that Washington “lives himself in a Hut, that is a little temporary Cabin such as one inhabited by the poorest Boor”, which is exaggeration bordering on slander. Washington lived in a tent for his first week at Valley Forge, but then moved into the Potts house with his entourage. The rest of his soldiers were housed in temporary log cabins built around the valley. <br><br>However, this house isn’t exactly the lap of luxury, either – the rooms are small, and it would have been cramped quarters for the military meetings that took place here – and the twenty-five people who ate, worked, and slept inside. It must’ve been like an 18th century Frat House. It’s said amongst Washington’s greatest achievements was the invention of Beer Pong.<br><br>Anyway, the house is a compromise between Washington’s need to convey the image of a leader, but not place himself too far above the people he leads.

GUNPOWDER MAGAZINE

Id: [0x00067BC8]
These buildings were used to store gunpowder, which was both a necessity in colonial America, and extremely dangerous to have around. This is not a place you’d want to move next door to. Spilled powder, damaged barrels, improper airing of the building... any one of these was hazardous, and a random spark could set off powder in the air or on the ground. <br><br>People who worked in the magazines were warned to check their pockets for stray matches, or made to wear clothes with no pockets to eliminate the possibility entirely. Their shoes had to be made without nails, or covered with 'magazine slippers' to reduce the risk of sparks. All the tools used in the magazines were made of wood and copper.<br><br>Generally, powder magazines were built in isolated areas (like the one on the Boston Common). Of course, if you're inside a fort you need your gunpowder to be close at hand, so the buildings were designed to collapse in on the fire and smother it, rather than spreading it outward. <br><br>I probably don't need to tell you this, but you’re not really allowed to smoke around here.

Id: [0x00067BCA]
Printing presses were originally brought to America to print religious texts, but by the time of the Revolutionary War they were also used for things like newspapers, pamphlets, and broadsheets. Think of it as the colonial Internet, about the same speed as dial-up. Unlike word of mouth, newspaper articles could spread news of events from colony to colony quickly, and without any loss of information. <br><br>But that doesn’t mean it was unbiased – far from it. Presses were commonly used to print propaganda. Every newspaper had its slant. Thank goodness that doesn’t happen nowadays. Anyway, part of what made the Boston Massacre such a turning point were reprints of Paul Revere’s woodcut - it showed organized British soldiers in full formation firing point-blank at an innocent crowd. A shocking image, which enraged the people and fuelled their hatred of the British. Completely made-up, of course, but what did that matter? The public is there to be manipulated.<br><br> Actually, I’d bet you could use these places to print some propaganda of your own. If the soldiers are getting too unfriendly, a little reminder that you’re a Hero of the People might help.

MARKETS

Id: [0x00067BCC]
There are a number of public markets in the colonies, meaning you can get supplies easily. Of course, paying for goods is another matter as currency was incredibly complex. People paid in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese coins, wampum , New Jersey and New York bills, magic beans, Laundromat coins... the list goes on.  We've simplified everything down for you in the Animus. (You're welcome.)<br><br>While some markets sold a variety of goods – like Faneuil Hall in Boston -- others were more specialized. New York’s Coenties Slip was mainly a fish market, (though like most markets it sold a little of everything), while if you were in the market for African slaves, Peck’s Slip was the place to go. <br><br>Yes, slavery was legal at the time, though it was less common in Boston than New York, which had the largest slave population in the north. Don’t be surprised to see European servants for sale, either – some were sold for a fixed number of years to pay back their passage to the New World - a much better deal than the slaves were offered.

SMITH AND COMPANY BREWERY

Id: [0x00067BCE]
At last. We can talk about beer.<br><br>This brewery was built in 1752 by Jonas Smith and his son Elias. By 1775, it was the largest brewery in New York. Smith was nominally Loyalist, but that didn’t stop him from providing beer to Washington’s army when it was stationed in the town – or to the British Regulars after their arrival. It seems neither army cared about loyalties where beer was concerned. That’s the kind of business attitude that built America. The American dream!

BROADWAY

Id: [0x00067BD0]
This is one of the oldest streets in New York City, if not the oldest, since its origins go back even before the days of New Amsterdam. It started out as the Wickquasgeck trail, used by the Indigenous Peoples to cross Manhattan island. It was turned into a street by the Dutch, who called it "BreedeWeg"  -  literally 'Broad Way'.<br><br>In modern day New York the street begins at the Bowling Green and extends across the entire island of Manhattan, through the Financial District and past Times Square and Columbia University.<br><br>Of course, at the time you're visiting, Broadway ends at the city common. The most famous stretch of the street - the Theatre District - is still wilderness, so you’re more likely to catch a bullet there than a show.<br><br>Which in some ways is preferable.

Id: [0x00067BD1]
BROAD STREET

Id: [0x00067BD2]
Broad St. is not Broadway, though you'd be forgiven for some confusion as they're right next to one another. This street was named after the Broad Canal, which used to run down the centre. <br><br>The canal was an inlet from the East River, and for part of its history you could canoe along it. By the late 17th century, however, the water was so clogged that was difficult - and inadvisable. Houses had been built alongside and both residents and local vendors used the canal to dispose of trash and sewage. When the British regained New York in 1674 they made many improvements to the city, one of which was filling in the now-stinking canal and paving the street over it. You can thank me on behalf of all Brits later.<br><br>Nowadays, Broad Street is in the middle of the Financial District, and is mostly home to banks, and another sight you might recognize - the columned façade of the New York Stock Exchange.

Id: [0x00067BD3]
WALL STREET

Id: [0x00067BD4]
In the 17th Century, this marked the edge of the city of New Amsterdam, and it was the location of the city's 12-foot palisade wall. The wall itself was torn down by the British in 1699 but the name "Wall Street" stuck.<br><br>By the late 18th century this was already becoming a financial centre - traders met at the Merchant Coffee House at the corner of Water Street, and under a buttonwood tree outside to trade securities. (This buttonwood tree is the site of the Buttonwood Agreement, which was the beginning of the New York Stock Exchange.)<br><br>The street is only 8 blocks long - as long today as you see it here in the late 1700s. If that seems extremely small remember: the skyscrapers are tall, rather than wide. Otherwise they’d be called Floorhuggers.

TRINITY CHURCH

Id: [0x00067BD6]
It's unfortunate you're too late to see Trinity Church before it burned (construction on a new church won't start until 1788). Trinity's a bit of an institution in New York, especially in the late 18th century. The church founded both the Trinity School, and King's College, which later became Columbia University. St. Paul's Chapel is another offshoot of the church. (You can't get a better indication of how Loyalist New York was than that: it had two branches of the same Anglican Church operating within blocks of one another.)<br><br>Captain William Kidd (yes, the famous pirate) lent some of his ship's equipment to help build the original church (the one you see here, burned), which was nice of him. Many people these days consider many pirates to have been rather progressive socialists with community-minded consciences, which I rather feel takes away from their mystique. It’s like finding out Genghis Kahn had solar panels.<br><br>Anyway, Kidd had even reserved a pew here, though he left New York before he ever got to sit in it. <br><br>The church building in modern-day New York is the third Trinity building. When it was finished in 1846, it was the tallest building in New York. Of course, it's at the corner of Wall Street, so you can imagine how tall it looks now compared to the local skyscrapers, showing you who really has the influence now.

Id: [0x00067BD7]
ST. PAUL'S CHAPEL

Id: [0x00067BD8]
This chapel opened in 1766 as an extension of Trinity Church, which is slightly farther down Broadway. Unlike Trinity Church, St. Paul's was saved from the Great Fire by local bucket brigades. The original building still stands today, making it one of the oldest churches in Manhattan.<br><br>During the revolution, St. Paul's was known for Loyalist leanings. It's Episcopalian, which is a subset of Anglican, which you'll remember is the 'Church of England'… you can probably guess whose side they were on. Church services specifically prayed for the King and Royal Family, which you can imagine wasn't too popular with the revolutionaries who were occupying the town in 1776. <br><br>After the war ended there was a turnaround in the Church's politics. The rector and some of the more Loyalist congregants left New York, and it became more Patriot-friendly. George Washington attended a service here on his inauguration day, and kept attending while he lived in New York - which probably went a long way toward repairing the church's reputation among the Patriot population.

Id: [0x00067BD9]
TRINITY SCHOOL

Id: [0x00067BDA]
The school opened in 1709 as a 'charity school', meaning it was free to attend and the students would have been from poorer families (at the time, most well-to-do children would have been educated at home). The school was originally in the bell tower of the Trinity Church, but by the time you're seeing it, it's moved across the street.  <br><br>This is the only school that remained open during the British occupation of New York, possibly because it was endowed by Trinity church, which was Loyalist.  (Of course, Trinity also funded King's College, which was closed and used a military hospital, but universities are known liberal hotbeds.)<br><br>After the Revolutionary War, the government started to focus on free public education and the city eventually stopped funding church schools, preferring to fund secular ones. Trinity School became a private preparatory school, which it still is. It's prestigious, expensive, and it's been accepting students for 300 years. That's a long time... for the colonies. Of course, Eton was founded in England in 1440 – that’s 20 years before Ezio was born, and around 50 years before Columbus discovered an America that Etonians would enjoy a proud tradition of looking down on for centuries to come.

CITY HALL

Id: [0x00067BDC]
This building served as New York's City Hall starting in 1702. It was also the city jail until the New Gaol opened in 1759. <br><br>Despite New York's historically Loyalist leanings, the building has a decidedly rebel-slanted past. Delegates from 9 of the colonies met here to co-ordinate protests against the Stamp Act. That meant representatives from British-instituted legislatures were protesting what British Parliament thought best - a truly huge step at the time.<br><br>After the Constitution was ratified in 1789, Congress began to meet here and the building renamed "Federal Hall". George Washington was inaugurated as president on the balcony on April 30, 1789. Oops, sorry – spoiler alert. Yes, he wins the war and becomes president. And then it turns out he was a ghost all along.<br><br>The building was expanded in 1788, but torn down in 1812. Despite its name, the modern-day "Federal Hall National Memorial" in New York City was never actually Federal Hall.

Id: [0x00067BDD]
KING'S COLLEGE

Id: [0x00067BDE]
King's College first opened on the first floor of the Trinity School in 1754, but it moved to the building that you see here in 1760. <br><br>This building survived the fire in 1776, but it wasn't being used as a school at the time. It had been shut down under the orders of the Continental army and turned into a hospital. It didn’t open again until war ended, when it was given a new name - "Columbia College". Another example of the word "King" falling out of favour among Americans - unless it involves burgers, of course, which just sums you people up.<br><br>The college stayed here until the mid-19th century when it moved to Midtown. The building's cornerstone was moved to the new location, but the rest was torn down and the land underneath it was sold at a tidy profit - which is the history of much of downtown New York.

Id: [0x00067BDF]
BRIDEWELL PRISON

Id: [0x00067BE0]
By 1773, the prison population at the New Gaol was getting so large that the city began plans for a new prison. Bridewell was started in 1773. The building was finished in 1775 but before it saw much use the war happened, and the British started to fill it with American POWs.<br><br>Prison conditions were terrible. Imagine a budget hotel, then take away the budget. There was very little food, most of it bad. There were no window panes - just bars over openings in the walls. One prisoner wrote that in three winter months, the only fire he saw was in the lanterns on the street. This was before our two and a half centuries of global warming, so you can imagine how cold it was.<br><br>When the war ended, this building went back to its intended use -holding local criminals and debtors. I can only hope the new government eventually installed windows and started work on the catering.<br><br>The building was torn down in 1838 and the stones were used to build a new prison that went by the happy nickname of 'The Tombs' – which wasn’t nearly as glamorous as it sounds. It’s been the pet name of every Manhattan jail since.

Id: [0x00067BE1]
THE NEW GAOL

Id: [0x00067BE2]
The "New Gaol" opened in 1759 was the first building in New York to be a dedicated prison - before this criminals were held in the basement of city hall - or in the case of debtors, in the attic, because that’s where I keep all my debtors. <br><br>The building was meant for convicted criminals too, but overwhelming poverty in the neighbourhood around it meant it quickly earned the nickname "the Debtors' Prison". By 1773 it was overcrowded, not just with Debtors but also with prisoners from the French and Indian War. Construction started on a new prison - the Bridewell.<br><br>Both the New Gaol and Bridewell prison were used to house POWs during the British occupation of New York.  It's an understatement to call the conditions there appalling. Hundreds of prisoners were kept with very little food, heat, or adequate clothing (those that did have clothing sold it to get more food.) Diseases like smallpox ran rampant among prisoners. <br><br>The man in charge of the prisons was the Provost Marshal William Cunningham. He was notorious for his cruel treatment of prisoners, and his presence earned the New Gaol yet another nickname - the Provost. His mum must have been so proud.

FORT GEORGE

Id: [0x00067BE4]
This fort has seen several name changes. It started off in 1625 as Fort Amsterdam - protecting the original Dutch settlement of New Amsterdam. Since then it's been known as Fort James and Fort William, before changing sex to Fort Anne, and swapping back in the 18th century, to Fort George.<br><br>When the Revolutionary War ended Fort George was torn down (perhaps predictably, given that this latest name was in honor of the King). <br><br>Should really have stuck with Fort Anne. Everybody loves an Anne.

Id: [0x00067BE5]
BOWLING GREEN

Id: [0x00067BE6]
This was one of New York's first public parks, established in 1733 by local landlords so people living in the area would have a place to walk, bowl, and get away from the noise of the city. <br><br>Since it's meant as a quiet park, there wouldn't be much more to tell except that a statue of King George III was placed here in 1770, commissioned to celebrate the repeal of the Stamp Act. In 1771, a wrought iron fence was added around the park - possibly to keep malcontents from vandalizing the statue.  <br><br>In 1776, rebels stormed the park, tore down the statue, and hacked it to pieces. The reason for the attack? They'd just heard the Declaration of Independence read publicly for the first time.  Most of the statue was later melted down and turned into musket balls for the Continental Army - perhaps the rebel version of destroying the Liberty Tree for firewood.<br><br>The Bowling Green still exists in modern day New York and it's home to another statue: the "Charging Bull" of Wall Street stands just outside the fence. Different times, different icons.

Id: [0x00067BE7]
HMS JERSEY

Id: [0x00067BE8]
The British took so many prisoners during the Revolutionary War that they quickly ran out of places to put them all. Prisons in New York (like the Bridewell) were full and the British took to using sugar houses, and pro-rebel churches in the city.<br><br>In the harbour, decommissioned war ships were put to use as prison ships, the most well-known being the HMS Jersey.  The Jersey had - and earned - the nickname 'Hell'. I wonder if you can guess why. Conditions below decks (where the prisoners were kept) were crowded - a thousand men crammed together without light, sanitation, or proper ventilation.  <br><br>About a dozen prisoners died every day - from smallpox, yellow fever, malnutrition, and torture by the guards.  I'm not even going to begin describing the food; well, alright, I’ll begin… "inedible" and "worm-infested". But I won’t finish.<br><br>The British sentiment was the rebels were traitors and didn't deserve any better.<br><br>At least 11000 people died on board the prison ships - more than rest of the war put together. After the British left New York, the US Navy found mass graves in the mud at the edge of the harbour. Those remains have since been placed under a monument in Brooklyn, where Fort Putnam used to be.

OLD ROYAL EXCHANGE

Id: [0x00067BEA]
This was the first covered market in New York. It started as a one-story building in 1675, but it was replaced with the building you see here in 1752. The lowest floor is for the market, and the second floor contains rooms that could be used for concerts, public meetings and balls.<br><br>Balls as in dances. Not just a big room full of balls.<br><br>It's no accident that this building bears a resemblance to Faneuil Hall in Boston. It was common architecture for markets at the time. Private houses didn't have the space for large numbers of people, so these buildings combined open space for a market, with closed-in space for the upper crust to have fancy parties.<br><br>Of course, public rooms could be used by the rabble as well. The Sons of Liberty brought crowds here, notably to choose delegates for the Second Continental Congress. (Technically, that was the New York Assembly's job, but they'd refused to send anyone.)<br><br>After the Revolutionary War ended, this building was the first home of the Supreme Court. Its first session began on February 2, 1790. It didn't stay here for long however, and moved to Philadelphia in 1791.

Id: [0x00067BEB]
INDEPENDENCE HALL

Id: [0x00067BEC]
This was built between the 1730s and 1750s to be the Pennsylvania State House. The architecture is Georgian, which was popular at the time, and essentially means the building was made to look similar to English manor houses of its day - 'Georgian', of course, being a reference to King George.<br><br>Some of the most important documents in the American Revolution came out of this building. The Declaration of Independence was first debated and signed here. The United Constitution was drafted here.  And if that weren't enough, the Liberty Bell rang in the bell tower to summon people to meetings (before it cracked beyond repair, of course, and also before it was really known as the Liberty Bell, but we won’t let that get in the way of a good story).<br><br>The building became known as Independence Hall in the 1820s - a result of the Marquis de Lafayette making a return trip to the United States. Lafayette’s visit was meant to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the revolution – and to remind a new generation what had happened, and where. It worked – creating a sense of national history, and an obsession with tagging things with the words 'Liberty', 'Independence', 'Freedom' and 'Washington'.

BUNKER HILL

Id: [0x0006B82E]
This is the largest hill on the Charlestown peninsula, and the closest to the mainland. <br><br>During the Battle of Bunker Hill rebel reinforcements arriving on the Charlestown peninsula headed to Bunker Hill, but weren't sure what to do once they got there. Rather than joining the battle- which was raging on Breed's Hill, nearby - they wandered aimlessly around Bunker Hill, so disorganized they hadn’t even brought a picnic.<br><br>Israel Putnam was here attempting to direct troops - giving valuable instructions such as the famous "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes" (Which he probably said several times, to anyone who'd listen, and to be fair, it’s a pretty great quote). That seems to be the only one of his directions that stuck - many of his other orders were either misunderstood or deliberately disobeyed. Given the disorganized state of the Continental Army at the time, it was probably a little of both.

Id: [0x0006B82F]
BREED'S HILL

Id: [0x0006B830]
Technically the Battle of Bunker Hill could have been called the "Battle of Breed's Hill". This is where the Continental Army built their main fortifications, and so most of the fighting happened here.  <br><br>Breed's Hill had only one thing to recommend it over Bunker Hill – it was closer to Boston, which made it easier to fire artillery at the city. Though of course one disadvantage of this situation was that it was also a lot easier for Boston to fire back. Nobody knows why William Prescott chose the spot over Bunker Hill - it's possible that, since he was working on fortifications in the dark, Prescott didn't realize how vulnerable the hill actually was until the sun rose. By which point it was a little too late to up and move. I imagine that was probably quite an awkward moment.

Id: [0x0006B831]
MOULTON'S HILL

Id: [0x0006B832]
The lowest hill on the Charlestown Peninsula, standing at 32 feet, or about 10 metres high, it is sometimes referred to as Moulton Hill or Moulton’s Point.<br><br>This is where General Howe's troops landed during the Battle of Bunker Hill. Boston's actually on the opposite side of the peninsula, but Howe took the longer route round to outflank the Revolutionaries on their left side. That was his excuse for taking the long route, anyway, and he was sticking to it.<br><br>However, Howe made a mistake when he arrived: he saw Continental troops on Bunker Hill and assumed they were newly-arrived reinforcements (they were mostly just confused and milling around, like aimless youths outside a shopping mall). Howe halted to wait for his own reinforcements, which gave the Continental Army time to shore up weak spots in their defenses. This made the battle much longer and more difficult than it might have been.<br><br>It also means there was an advantage to the chaos in the Continental Army that day - they managed to confuse their enemies as well as themselves. It’s not a bad tactic. To this day, if anyone starts on me, I just spin around and shout about tables until they’re too confused and amble off.

CHARLESTOWN

Id: [0x0006B834]
Charlestown is the name of both the small town to the north of Boston, and the peninsula it sits on.  <br><br>The peninsula was the site of the Battle of Bunker Hill (which was sometimes called the 'Battle of Charlestown', since the fighting did span across more than one hill). This is also where Paul Revere started his well-known Midnight Ride, which I still think sounds more like something you’d do with a lady.<br><br>As to the town of Charlestown - well, while it was established prior to 1775, little of it survived the Battle of Bunker Hill. Continental Army snipers were stationed here to harass British troops, and the British set fire to the town to root them out. Most of the buildings were razed, and the rest was burned during a raid in January, 1776. The only part of the town to survive the war was the street layout. <br><br>Charlestown was rebuilt, however - it's now a part of Boston.

CHESAPEAKE BAY

Id: [0x0006B836]
The Chesapeake Bay runs along the coast of Virginia and Maryland. It's one of the largest bays in the United States - more than 300 kilometres long and up to 40 kilometres wide - and the site of the first permanent British settlement in North America - Jamestown, established in 1607. <br><br>Every day at 16:07 I have a cup of tea and think of it.<br><br>It's also the site of the Battle of the Chesapeake, one of the most important naval battles of the Revolutionary war.

LEXINGTON

Id: [0x0006B838]
Lexington is a small farming community, and the site of the first battle of the American Revolution started. No, I'm not being overly dramatic – the first battle took place on Lexington green.<br><br>On the morning of April 19, 1775, British Regulars passed through Lexington on their way to Concord looking for hidden rebel weapon caches.<br><br>The Lexington militia, led by John Parker, formed up on the village green -probably more in a show of resistance than because they were expecting a real battle. The militia was badly outnumbered – about 70 of them to 700 British soldiers. John Pitcairn ordered the rebels to disperse, and they might have done so… except somebody fired a shot. Then, everyone started firing – those that weren't running, that is.<br><br>Several militia members were killed, the rest retreated. The British moved on toward Concord – though they would be harassed by the Lexington militia again on their return trip toward Boston.<br><br>Lexington's town motto is now "What a Glorious Morning for America" – though it's possible it didn't seem like one at the time. “Firing Guns and Then Running Away, Since 1775!” might have been a nice alternative. Every town needs a bumper sticker.

CONCORD

Id: [0x0006B83A]
This was the Regulars' destination when they set out from Boston on the day of the battles of Lexington and Concord. Inside the town, the British found cannon, flour, salt food, and musket balls. They broke the cannon and threw the rest into the local mill pond – a bad idea since the local residents retrieved most of it later, undamaged. <br><br>In their zeal the regulars also accidentally set fire to the local meeting house – (it happens) - and then joined the bucket brigade to help put it out. However, the local militia saw the smoke and thought the Regulars had set fire to the whole town. The militia marched in, causing a battle with the Regulars at the North Bridge, just outside of town. It was a comedy of errors with very little comedy.<br><br>The battle at the North Bridge battle was immortalized in the "Concord Hymn" - a popular poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson lived in Concord in the 1830s, which probably made him a bit biased. He refers to the fighting at the bridge as "the shot heard 'round the world" – bit of an overstatement, since the first shots of the war had been fired at Lexington, hours before. Maybe he’d been napping. You know what poets are like.

FORT DUQUESNE

Id: [0x0006B83C]
This fort sits at the junction of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers - essentially the beginning of the Ohio River. In 1754, the French and British governments were fighting over who controlled the territory in the area. When settlers from Virginia began to build a fort, French Canadian forces chased them out, which is weird, because Canadians are usually so polite. Anyway, they finished the fort, which was nice of them, and named it after the then-governor of New France, the Marquis Duquesne, which was wonderfully thoughtful.<br><br>In response, the British colonial government sent George Washington to re-take the fort (at the Battle of Fort Necessity), and then Edward Braddock (the Braddock Expedition). Both attempts failed miserably, each being defeated before they ever reached the fort. <br><br>Fort Duquesne remained under French control until 1758, when the French troops abandoned and burned it. The British moved in and rebuilt it, naming the new construction 'Fort Pitt' - the location of modern-day Pittsburgh, which makes me think maybe they shouldn’t have bothered.

HANCOCK-CLARKE HOUSE

Id: [0x0006B83E]
John Hancock's grandfather (the Reverend John Hancock) had this parsonage built in 1737. The "Clarke" in the name is Reverend Jonas Clarke, who lived here at the time the Revolution started. I’d have just called it Hanclarke House, myself, but that’s just because I’m a great thinker.<br><br>John Hancock (the famous politician, not his grandfather) and Samuel Adams were staying here as Clarke's guests the night before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. William Dawes and Paul Revere arrived sometime after midnight with a warning that the Regulars were on their way. Adams and Hancock moved to a safer location – Hancock, it seems, under protest, since he wanted to go down to the Green and fight. <br><br>Men who want to down to greens and fight at midnight are of course dedicated men of passion. <br><br>That, or they’ve had a few beers.

KANIÈN:KEH NATION TERRITORY

Id: [0x0006B840]
More commonly known these days as the "Mohawk Valley", this valley follows the Mohawk River as it runs between the Catskill and Adirondack mountains. It is part of the territory of the Kanien'kehà:ka - sometimes known as the "Mohawk" in English, hence the name. <br><br>The valley also happens to be the only natural route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes - meaning it was the only easy way to get from the coast into frontier territory, and up into Canada. This made the valley incredibly strategically important during the French and Indian War and during the Revolutionary war. <br><br>And by 'strategically important' I mean the valley was contested territory and regularly raided. Most of the settlements in it were razed during the Revolutionary War - actually, the damage to the surrounding farmland was so bad that food had to be shipped into the area from the south. The Revolution is known in the area as "The Burning of the Valleys" - that says it all, really.

BOSTON NECK

Id: [0x0006B842]
In the 18th century, the only land route into Boston was across a narrow strip of land - called "Boston Neck". <br><br>One often talks about the heart of Africa, of course, or the bosom of Europe. How wonderful that Boston gets a neck.<br><br>Fortifications were built across the neck to protect the city from a land attack, I suppose a bit like a heavy necklace, or a handsome neck brace.<br><br>When the Siege of Boston began in 1775, Governor Gage ordered that the fortifications be expanded and strengthened - they became known as "Gage's Lines".<br><br>Starting in the 19th century, land was added to Boston Neck,  widening it to make room for the city to grow - and, presumably, to ease traffic on and off the island, since Boston's no longer in danger of attack from the countryside.

BATTLE OF FORT NECESSITY

Id: [0x0006B844]
This was one of the opening battles of the French and Indian war, and it’s important that opening battles are quite exciting, otherwise everyone just sort of loses interest.<br><br>In 1754, George Washington was sent to the head of the Ohio River valley with a group of Virginia militia. The land there was contested territory between the British Colonists and the French. Washington's mission was to re-take Fort Duquesne, and drive French forces out of the area.<br><br>Washington and his troops attacked a French patrol at Jumonville Glen, in what would be the first acts of violence in the war. Washington expected a return attack and so had his troops build a palisade wall surrounding their supplies - a "Fort of Necessity" - hence the name.<br><br>But they might as well have called it the “Fort of Inadequacy”, because supplies ran low, and the militia (and their British Regular reinforcements) were quickly overwhelmed. On July 4, Washington surrendered, was allowed to retreat, and someone else was put in charge of naming forts. <br><br>It was Washington’s only military surrender (though he had plenty of 'strategic retreats’ – PR spin was alive and well even then…).

BATTLE OF NASSAU

Id: [0x0006B846]
The Battle of Nassau was one of the first fought by the Continental Navy. <br><br>The town of Nassau sits on the island of New Providence in the Caribbean Sea. At the beginning of the Revolutionary war, the island was controlled by the British and a destination for Loyalists fleeing the American colonies. It was also a destination for any stores the British didn't want the Continental Army to have - such as gunpowder. <br><br>As soon as the revolution broke out, The (British) Governor of Virginia moved the colony's weapon stores here so the rebels couldn't steal them. Of course, as soon as Washington had the Navy up and running, one of their first missions was to go and reclaim the gunpowder. They loved the stuff – couldn’t get enough of it.<br><br>The Continental Navy attacked Fort Montagu, at the entrance to the harbour, on March 3. Plans to capture the town at the same time fell through, and so the army didn't capture Nassau itself until the next day. The delay meant that most of the gunpowder was gone by the time the rebels arrived, very much the military equivalent of showing up late to a party and realising all the beer’s gone.  The governor had shipped it off during the night - when the Continental Navy had neglected to put even one ship on guard in the harbour. <br><br>The rebels spent the next two weeks loading any of the munitions that were left onto ships before sailing back to Connecticut. Two weeks seems like a long time - perhaps they were checking the beaches very thoroughly, just in case there were cannon hidden in the sand.

COPP'S HILL BATTERY

Id: [0x0006B848]
Copp's Hill is one of the tallest hills in Boston and the highest point in Boston's North End. The hill was fortified during the Siege of Boston, partly to discourage rebels from building their own fortifications across the river on the Charlestown peninsula. <br><br>The artillery on Copp's Hill fired on the Continental Army during the Battle of Bunker Hill… well, sort of. It was actually a bit more distraction than destruction - at least at the Breed's Hill fortifications. The artillery fire on the town of Charlestown was more effective - the resulting fires forced out Continental Army snipers and levelled the town.

NORTH BATTERY

Id: [0x0006B84A]
The North Battery was one of the first fortifications built in Boston after the city was founded. Since Boston was mostly accessible by water, it was vulnerable to attack from the French and Dutch. The residents of Boston's North End had the battery built in the mid-17th century to protect the harbour. It was never actually used, but somehow having a military fort nearby just made people feel safer - much like American airport security, but with uniforms that actually fit them, and less dandruff and passive aggression.

FORT HILL AND SOUTH BATTERY

Id: [0x0006B84C]
Fort Hill is the second-highest hill in Boston – if only it had tried harder when it was a little hillock - and overlooks Boston Harbour. Defenses were built here in the mid-17th century - along with a smaller one-gun fortification near the harbour - named the South Battery.<br><br>The South battery was expanded in the 1740s, but had fallen out of use by the 1760s. Both it and Fort Hill were rebuilt by the Patriots during the Revolutionary War, but both were dismantled before the turn of the century.<br><br>Fort Hill - the hill itself, not the fortification - was levelled in the late 1860s to make room for more land, so it never realized its dream of becoming the highest hill in town. If that sounds familiar, it's because it happened to every hill in Boston. <br><br>Hills are the natural enemies of Bostonians, and always will be.

TRADING POSTS

Id: [0x0006B84E]
Trading Posts were essentially general stores set up in the North American frontier. The clientele - mainly explorers and members of local Indigenous nations - would barter for various goods, such as guns, axes, and pots and pans. Payment was mostly in the form of furs, which were shipped back to Europe. The fur trade at the time was extremely lucrative, and one of the reasons that explorers were continually moving into the frontier - they were hoping to find more and better sources of pelts. There was a reason Davy Crockett only ever seemed to have one hat.<br><br>Many of the trading posts were privately owned, but they were used to push political agendas as well. For example, after the Revolutionary War ended, the British government used their trading posts to encourage the Indigenous Peoples not to sign treaties with the United States.<br><br>The United States government took over the colonial fur trade in the colonies in 1796, establishing something called the "Factory" system. The idea was to regulate prices in order stop exploitation of the Indigenous Peoples by private traders. Unfortunately, under the new system, Indigenous leaders were forced to trade large amounts of land to get access to trading posts. Private exploitation had become government exploitation. Lucky that’s the only time in history that’s ever happened. Since that obviously wasn't any better, the factory system was abolished in 1822.

Martinique is an island in the Caribbean Sea. At the time of the Revolutionary War, it was a French colony, and a lucrative port in the sugar trade. The British captured Martinique during the Seven Years' War. However, it was so profitable for the French that they signed over almost all their Canadian territory at the end of the war, simply to get it back. <br><br>Hmm… a beautiful, lucrative island in the Caribbean – or some tinpot, arse-freezing Nova Scotian backwater…<br><br>It’s just so TRICKY, I need more time!

FORT WOLCOTT

Fort Wolcott was built to protect the nearby town of Newport, Rhode Island. The fort sits in Newport harbour on a small island known as "Goat Island".<br><br>I know almost no one who would want to live in a place called Goat Island. <br><br>Apart from one goat I know.<br><br>The original fort was built in the early 1700s by the Spanish. It was expanded by the British in the 1730s, which is when it was named Fort George (after King George II, of course).  The fort was captured by Rhode Islanders twice in the 1760s and used to fire on British ships in the harbour. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, the rebels renamed it Fort Liberty. It was retaken by the British in November In 1776 – who decided Fort Liberty wasn’t really appropriate any more and returned its name to Fort George.<br><br>It remained Fort George until about 1784, when it was again occupied by rebel forces and renamed Fort Washington. It was later renamed Fort Wolcott - after Oliver Wolcott.<br><br>I know what you're thinking, and it's true: this fort has changed names more times than your high school band.

Not exactly a first date venue, this.<br><br>Dead Chest Island is part of the British Virgin Islands, though it's an island in the same way that Pluto is a planet - It's really more of a big rock.<br><br>However, I won't deny the place has an interesting name - and an interesting history. According to legend, Edward Teach - better known as Blackbeard - visited the "island", and left 15 of his crewmen here as a punishment.  Each crewman each had a bottle of rum and cutlass - and when Blackbeard returned, most of the men were dead. Maybe the rum was bad. <br><br>Robert Louis Stevenson wrote a song about that story - you may have heard of it - "Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum/ 15 men on a Dead Man's Chest". Of course, Stevenson wrote "Dead Man's Chest" and the island's name is "Dead Chest", but that’s the rhythm of poetry for you, and I think the link is fairly clear.

OCTAVIUS

Id: [0x0006B856]
This ship is actually the center of a ghost story that most historians would tell you is complete bunk. Unlike all other ghost stories, of course. And yet, here we are.<br><br>According to legend, the Octavius was captained by Hendrick van der Huel, who once served as quartermaster for Captain William Kidd.  In 1761, the ship left England, on its way to Asia. The captain and crew made the dangerous passage around Cape Horn, and a year later, the ship was completely stocked and ready to return to Europe.<br><br>No one knows why van der Huel decided to return home through the Northwest Passage. At the time no one had ever even found a sea route through the North - making this decision akin to suicide. Unsurprisingly, the ship disappeared en route - presumably sunk, or locked in the ice.<br><br>That's when things get really interesting. Sometime in the 1770s, the crew of a whaling ship found the Octavius floating off the coast of Greenland. The crew inside had all frozen to death - including the captain, who was frozen in the process of writing a log entry - dated to 1762. That means the crew of the Octavius died, and sometime in the intervening years the ship made the Northwest Passage - by itself.<br><br>Yup. Definitely ghosts.

OAK ISLAND

Oak Island is in Mahone Bay on the eastern shore of Canada.  The island features prominently in local pirate legends - it seems the 'secret' treasure Kidd buried here didn't remain as secret as he would have liked, which of course was very secret, hence the word ‘secret’.<br><br>Treasure hunts first began in 1795, a local teenager spotted a tree with rope burns and a nearby depression in the ground - which he thought was a sure sign that something had been lowered into a pit.  He and some friends started to dig, but quickly got beyond their depth and resolved to come back with better tools. Subsequent digs have happened in 1803, 1861, 1866, 1893, 1909, 1931… well, you get the idea - but nothing's ever been found. Six people have died hunting for the supposed treasure.<br><br>Over the years, theories about the origin of the 'Money Pit' have been abundant: it's nothing more than a sinkhole; treasure was left in the pit - either by William Kidd, or the Freemasons, or the Templars. <br><br>Here's my personal favourite - Francis Bacon used the pit to store the original documents proving that he wrote the works of William Shakespeare. I'm almost sorry that one isn't true.<br><br>Or is it…?<br><br>No. It’s not.

EDINBURGH CASTLE, JAMAICA

Not to be confused with the rather more famous Edinburgh Castle in Scotland - this "Edinburgh Castle" is more of a stone manor house. The building has a castle-like appearance, with its two circular towers, useful for shooting at enemies - or, if you were the owner - random travellers who happened by.<br><br>Lewis Hutchinson was a doctor from Scotland who bought the land here in 1768. By 1770, he'd earned the nicknames "The Mad Master" and "The Mad Doctor".  See if you can spot the word that links those two nicknames. Nobody local went near Edinburgh Castle if they could help it.  But the main road in the area went right by the manor house, meaning many travellers walked directly into Hutchinson's path. <br><br>Hutchinson would shoot his victims from one of the towers, take their valuables, and have his slaves toss the body into a nearby sinkhole. If someone happened to stop and ask for hospitality, he would invite them in … and they would never leave. <br><br>Hutchinson was arrested in 1773 for murder, and subsequently hanged. Nobody knows how many people he killed in his 5 years at the castle, but after his execution, a collection of 43 watches was found inside. <br><br>So at least 43, I’d say.

The Mayan city of Cerros sits on a hilltop overlooking Chetumal  Bay. In the late 17th century, this is Spanish territory, though it will become part of the British Honduras, and eventually the independent nation of Belize.<br><br>Of course, Cerros itself predates all that - it was founded sometime around 350 BC, when it was an important trading center for ships travelling up the coast. In its heyday, about 1100 people lived there. <br><br>That may not seem like a lot - but the stonework in the area shows the city's prominence. The architecture features stepped pyramids, stone carvings, temples, and get this - two ball courts. Now, we're not clear on the rules, but from the location of the courts it seems the game was important - and deadly. Murals at other similar sites show the winners beheading their opponents. Maybe that was their version of trash talking the other team. Or maybe not…<br><br>And I thought Americans took their 'football' seriously.

ATLANTIC OCEAN

Of course, crossing the Atlantic today is as easy as a plane ride, but it was much more difficult in colonial times – even though I imagine the tiny food and cramped conditions and likelihood of sitting next to a fat man for many hours were pretty much the same. <br><br>For European travellers it was at best a six-week voyage - but depending on delays it could last months. Dangers included storms (and their opposite, being becalmed) seasickness, food running short and dying of boredom because you had nothing to do all day. <br><br>For Africans captured into slavery, the Atlantic voyage was much worse - across the "middle passage", usually to the Caribbean. The journey was just as long, but slaves were kept below decks and rarely allowed out in the fresh air - with the men usually in shackles. They were given only one meal a day - less if provisions ran low. Disease was rampant, and mortality rates were high.  <br><br>I will never complain about being inappropriately touched by airport security again. Though to be fair, we’re now firm friends, and Juan was very gentle.

CARIBBEAN SEA

The Caribbean Sea sits between the coast of Central and South America on one side, and the West Indies on the other. The name 'Caribbean' is taken from 'Carib', the name of the indigenous peoples living on the islands when Columbus 'discovered' them in 1492. <br><br>In Colonial times, European powers relied on the Caribbean islands for crops, such as sugar and coffee beans, which were in high demand. Maybe that’s where the ‘bean’ bit comes from, though I doubt it. In fact, the value of trade in the Caribbean was one of the big reasons that the Continental Army needed a navy of its own - they needed to be able to disrupt trade there in order to make the Revolutionary War a bigger pain in Britain's pocketbook.

Around 1000 years ago, a long and bloody war engulfed the five indigenous nations that inhabited what is now known as central New York State, southern Ontario, southern Quebec, and western Vermont.   In the west were the Seneca and Cayuga nations.  To the east were the Kanien’kehá:ka and Oneida nations.  Located in the center of this territory was the Onondaga Nation.<br><br>In the midst of this war, a messenger known as the Peacemaker provided a path of peace, righteousness, and power that unified these nations and put an end to their bloody war.  This union or alliance is called the Haudenosaunee, a western Iroquoian term that is generally translated as People of the Longhouse.  The Kanien’kehá:ka term is Rotinonhsón:ni, which means “they are building an extended house.”  In 1722, the Tuscarora Nation was adopted into the Haudenosaunee, becoming the sixth nation of the confederation. <br><br>The foundation of Haudenosaunee Confederacy is the Kaianere’kó:wa – the Great Law of Peace.

The Haudenosaunee were also known as the Iroquois by the French and the Six Nations Confederacy by the English following the naturalization of the Tuscarora Nation in 1722.<br><br>Called Mohawk by the Dutch after an offensive Algonquin term for cannibal, the Kanien’kehá:ka are considered to be the “Keepers of the Eastern Door”, sharing with the Seneca Nation the responsibility for guarding the doorways of the symbolic Longhouse of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy.   Due to their strategic geographic location in the east, the Kanien’kehá:ka were the first of the Haudenosaunee nations to establish diplomatic and economic relations with Europeans on behalf of the Confederacy.

HAUDENOSAUNEE CLAN SYSTEM

Id: [0x0006B894]
The Kanien’kehá:ka are a matrilineal society, transferring identity through the mother’s linage.  This extended family is called a clan.  The Kanien’kehá:ka have three clans – the Turtle Clan, Wolf Clan, and Bear Clan.  Family names and clans are passed down from mother to child.  <br><br>Each member of a clan is considered a relative regardless of which Haudenosaunee nation they belong to.  For example, a Wolf Clan member of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation and a Wolf Clan member of the Seneca Nation are still considered relatives.    Likewise, the men and women of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation practiced exogamy, marrying outside their matrilineal clan family.  <br><br>Clans have specific social, spiritual, and political roles to play in Kanien’kehá:ka society and is the pillar of traditional Kanien’kehá:ka governance.  Within the clans of the Kanien’kehá:ka all leadership members hold equal powers and are accountable to everyone.  A woman leader, called Iakoiá:ner or Clanmother, holds a powerful leadership role in the nation and has the authority to select a Roiá:ner or Chief to represent her clan politically.  Moreover, she also has the power to depose her Chief and replace him with another candidate.  Taking into account all she knows about the candidate in his dealings throughout his life she decides who is a good fit to represent the clan.  Clanmothers choose men who are honest, reliable, and clear headed, with knowledge of Kaianere’kó:wa –  the Great Law of Peace.<br><br>Amongst the Haudenosaunee nations there are eight clans: Turtle, Wolf, Beaver, Hawk, Eel, Deer, Bear, and Snipe clans.   The Kanien’kehá:ka themselves have three clans: Turtle, Wolf, and Bear.

LONGHOUSES

Id: [0x0006B896]
In the times before European contact and up until the early 1800’s, longhouses originally served as the living quarters of Iroquoian people.  Stretching between 40 and 200 feet long, longhouses were long rectangular structures that housed a number of families belonging to a particular matrilineal clan family. Along the inner walls were open compartments for each nuclear family with a long courtyard in the center, which connected the two entrances on each end of the building.  Two adjacent families would share one fire hearth at each compartmental increment.<br><br>When the Peacemaker brought the Good Tidings of Peace and Power to the Iroquois, he used the concept of the Longhouse as the symbol of the political and spiritual union of the Iroquois Confederacy.  The Kaianere’kó:wa, the Great Law of Peace, identifies specific geographically appropriate household roles for each of the Five Nations sheltered beneath the dormers of the symbolic Longhouse.  <br><br>The Mohawks serve as the Keepers of the Eastern Door, the Senecas as Keepers of the Western Door, and the centrally placed Onondagas serve as the Firekeepers; where all Confederate business is transacted.  Each nation had its own hearth which symbolized its own domestic government, while the rafters symbolized the laws of the League; that continues to extend with every resolution of the Grand Council of Chiefs.

WAMPUM

Id: [0x0006B89C]
Made with sea shells found along the eastern seaboard, wampum was used amongst the native people of Eastern Woodlands.  Amongst the Haudenosaunee, wampum made from the Quahog shell would be refined into cylindrical beads and used to create belts and strings, which would be used as mnemonic tools that commemorate treaties, laws, and other important events, in addition to symbols of legitimacy for leadership.

Id: [0x0006B89D]
WAR POST

Id: [0x0006B89E]
When an Iroquoian village was to take up the war path, they sometimes held a ritual whereby the warriors would strike a large wooden post in the village to prepare for battle.  A hatchet would be left in the post until the war was finished, when it would be removed.

POCKET BOROUGHS

Id: [0x0006C3CA]
One of the issues surrounding the American Revolution was that the colonies had no representatives - and thus no say - in British Parliament. <br><br>To add insult to injury, some parts of the United Kingdom that had no actual residents DID have seats in Parliament. This essentially meant landowners could give the cushy government appointments to whomever they wanted. These areas were known as "pocket boroughs" (because the landowner had them in his pocket) or "rotten boroughs" (a fun game is to guess why). <br><br>One of the worst examples was the borough of Old Sarum, which had no voters and two seats in Parliament. However, it wasn't the only one. Pocket boroughs were numerous - as of 1761 it's estimated that 250 of the 558 parliamentary boroughs were under this kind of patronage - and the problem wasn't really corrected until the late 19th century. <br><br>So when the Colonists were complaining that the British Government was hopelessly corrupt? They had a point.

Major Guy Carlton is set to relieve the siege of Fort St-Jean. Ride north and make sure he never arrives.

Id: [0x0006CB00]
Richard Montgomery is foolishly leading a Colonial force on an assault of Quebec. He cannot be dissuaded. Divert his forces or stop the attack by whatever means necessary.

Id: [0x0006CB01]
Brigadier General William Thompson has set out to 'liberate' Quebec from British rule. The territories have never asked to be freed and are not part of the Colonies. Follow the campaign and guarantee the people of Trois-Rivières are heard.

Id: [0x0006CB02]
British Parliament has passed The Quebec Act, granting vast parts of the Ohio territory to the newly founded Province. People in the Ohio territory are outraged. Do what you can to see that the people of Quebec are not hauled into a war they didn't ask for.

Id: [0x0006CB18]
New Hampshire is moving to establish an Independent Government for the duration of the war to better expedite political proceedings in these troubled times. It is wise. But where power is being distributed the Templar brokers are never far behind. Attend the elections and be vigilant.

Id: [0x0006CB1B]
A massive stockpile of weapons and powder has gone missing. The very couriers we just apprehended still managed to get their information back to whoever was waiting for it. Try and track down the munitions' whereabouts.

Id: [0x0006CB1C]
After finding out Charles Lee was seeing to the gathering of all New Hampshire munitions and returning it all to where it came from, New Hampshire is free of Templar grasp, for now. Return there periodically and maintain a watchful eye.

Id: [0x0006CB24]
Some British schooners have been prowling off the coast of Gloucester. Take First Mate Faulkner of the Aquila and pin them in allowing the Patriots in the area to capture the war ships.

Id: [0x0006CB25]
Gun powder is in short supply for the Patriot cause, despite the militias best efforts to seize as much as possible. Some French ships are delivering several thousand barrels over the next few weeks. Accompany the convoys and ensure they arrive at their destinations safely.

Id: [0x0006CB26]
Henry Knox is attempting to drag the guns of Ticonderoga over the Appalachian mountains to help lift the Siege of Boston. With a little Assassin ingenuity you'll be able to help him succeed in his lofty goals.

Id: [0x0006CB27]
The British are laying siege to Boston. Civilians are in danger all over the city and food will be in short supply before long. Help ration what there is and protect those who can't protect themselves.

Id: [0x0006CB28]
Henry Knox managed to bring the guns of Ticonderoga to Dorchester Heights with the help of the Assassins. With a formidable battery in place on high ground, it's only a matter of time before General Howe realizes his position is untenable. Help expedite the process.

Id: [0x0006CB30]
The Revolution will touch Rhode Island's territory as well. The War Council has however left the Colony to its own defenses leaving the 1st Rhode Island Regiment to protect the city of Newport and Aquidneck Island. Give them your support.

Id: [0x0006CB31]
After difficulties with the French Fleet during the Battle at Rhode Island, General Sullivan has sent a scathing letter to Boston reporting on the French involvement, or lack thereof. Catch up with Admiral Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, and convince him to be the bigger man. The Patriots can't afford to lose the support of France.

Id: [0x0006CB32]
A secret shipment of black powder is arriving in Newport for the Assassins. Greet the ship at the pier and escort the goods back to our magazine.

Id: [0x0006CB33]

A regiment of British Regulars has occupied Danbury. The soldiers have been drinking the town's rum stores and are threatening to burn the village. Rouse the militias in the surrounding countryside and mount an offensive.

Id: [0x0006CB3D]
Jonathan Trumbull is one of the only Governors to support the Patriot cause. There is something about his course of action that raises suspicion. Tail the Governor of Connecticut and try to discern his true allegiance.

Id: [0x0006CB3E]
Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton of the Regulars is trying to draw General Washington into open conflict. Washington knows such a maneuver would spell certain doom for his tenuous army and is relying on the efforts of his Culper Ring to keep his movements secret. Meet some of the Culper Ring spies in New Haven and escort them to West Point.

Id: [0x0006CB3F]
The turncoat Benedict Arnold is leading a regiment of Regulars into New London and Groton. Ride to the battle and stop Arnold. Kill him if you get close enough.

Id: [0x0006CB40]

You may have noticed in your travels that the Frontier has rather a lot of trees. That turned out to be very handy for the Colonists, because you needed lumber for pretty much everything - from ships to buildings to furniture; or simply to heat your home in the winter.<br><br>Lumbering developed into a trade fairly quickly. It was both a dangerous and low-paying job that generated tough, hard-working folks; it's now somewhat symbolic of the hardship settlers had to face establishing themselves in North America.

To say that farming was a difficult occupation in Colonial America would be an understatement. Farmers had to clear their lot of rocks and trees before working the soil in the hope that it would yield effective results. It could take years before a farm would become fully sustainable. Apart from a few visits to nearby settlements to trade equipment and supplies or sell whatever was in surplus from their crops, farmers would often remain on their land their whole life. <br><br>Farmers had to be autonomous. They had to take care of their home, farming equipment, livestock, as well as procuring the necessary supplies to sustain living in sometimes harsh conditions, especially in northern regions.<br><br>So if you enjoy backbreaking work in a lonely atmosphere, this would be the job for you. (And if that was their slogan, they needed a better marketing department.)

Benjamin Franklin once said that “North America has no mines”. Which was rather silly of him, because it actually did. However, I'm telling you this to show you that there weren't very MANY mines. The cost of transport and the vast distances over which mined ore had to be carried discouraged anyone but the most enterprising (and given the amount of work the average Colonist had to do from day-to-day, you'd frankly have to be very enterprising or very desperate.)  <br><br>However, during the Revolutionary War, imports of metal were scarce - and sort of necessary for basic tools (like guns), so mining as an industry picked up. Most mines were used to dig copper and iron. Miners worked in extremely difficult conditions, often under the threat of raids from the local Indigenous peoples. They were usually low-wage foreign workers with few other employment options. So, desperate then.

Id: [0x0006CBD4]
Hunting in colonial America represented a significant point of contact between settlers and Native Americans and was a fundamental part of both colonial and Native culture.<br><br>Hunting was both lucrative and the primary way to procure food in isolated areas. Hunters would roam the vast expanses of the frontier, tracking and hunting game that would in turn yield good profits (at least, if they didn't try to cheat you out of them at the local trading post, which I'm sure never happened.). In fact, the fur trade was one of the main reasons that European settlement of the frontier moved so quickly - pelts were in high demand in England and France.

The woodworker is second only to the blacksmith in terms of importance for the healthy development of colonial settlements. Carpenters and joiners were needed everywhere, from house building to furniture production. Using a variety of tools, they would develop fairly sophisticated techniques -  chiseled mortises (which sounds very fancy but is actually a way of joining two pieces of wood), carved moldings (which actually are fancy) and complicated staircases, providing settlers with sturdy and durable, if somewhat roughly finished wood items.<br><br>Of course, nowadays you'd probably be charged extra for the half-finished, "authentic" colonial look. The Colonists didn't know how trendy they were.

Id: [0x0006CBD6]
Cloth formed the largest import during the 18th century, and tailoring was largest trade in metropolitan areas for an even longer period. Since togas had long since gone out of style, tailors were necessary, since everyone the cloth turned into clothes.<br><br>Tailors dealt with people from all walks of society: men, women and children, rich or poor, taking their measurements and producing fitted garments.  These would often be of similar design; only the fabric in which they were cut would mark the social standing of the wearer.

Id: [0x0006CBD7]
Blacksmithing was a crucial activity in colonial America, and the blacksmith was often considered to be the most important person in a village. Forges and “tin shops” provided everyday items, from household utensils to farming tools and building supplies, nails, hammers, axes and such, along with the all-important horseshoes (think of them as being like tyres for your car. Essential for travel, really).<br><br>Blacksmiths were also a vital part of the logistical chain of any army, since their highly specialized skills were required to either produce or repair weapons and military equipment of all kind, in addition to providing assistance in taking care of horses. Unsurprising, really - if you're working with a lot of metal things that are often broken, it's handy to have someone around who can fix them.

Id: [0x0006CBD8]
During the Revolutionary War, medical knowledge and practices were only beginning to evolve to what they are today. Doctors and nurses were rare, often lacked formal training and very few of them had any sort of specialization. Treatments were rudimentary for the most part, and there was still heavy reliance on bleeding to treat infections. (I trust I don't have to tell you that doesn't work very well at all.) The instruments they used probably didn't look much different from torture devices - which makes them sound a bit like a visit to my dentist, really.<br><br>Of course, there were people who began to take a deep and genuine interest in the application of scientific principles in pursuing knowledge of medicine. They would document and share information with their peers to increase the collective knowledge - generally a good idea - which led to a general increase of the quality of diagnosis and treatments. Unfortunately, things only improved very slowly, so if you're thinking of just popping in because you're feeling under the weather, it might be best to wait a century or so.

Id: [0x0006CBD9]
Inns and taverns were central to colonial life. In addition to being a place where people would meet around a meal, drink a few ales, or discuss important matters for the community, they were stations for travellers - offering a roof, a warm bed or a clean floor, a hot meal and often care for one’s horse - which is nice, because you wouldn't want your horse to feel left out. <br><br>Innkeepers were important figures both locally and regionally, because they dealt with a great many people, from humble labourers to campaigning Generals. This made them a prime source of news: any innkeepers worth their salt knew everyone for miles around their inn, and they generally made sure everyone knew them, too.

Heyo. had a little bit of downtime while you were “gone,” so figured I’d do what I could to upgrade the operating system. It’s actually been ready for a little while now, but with the Animus in safe mode, I wasn’t about to try an installation.<br><br>THINGS I DID (actually it should be WE since I had a few people in the other cells chip in):<br><br>1. Modifications to the targeting system. You should be able to move in and out of combat more easily. <br><br>2. Free-running improvements. You’re less likely to jump at the wrong time/in the wrong direction.<br><br>3. Only one input for interacting with the world. No more choosing between parts of your ancestor’s body. <br><br>4. You can assassinate while moving now. Definitely try it out ASAP! You can pick up weapons on the go as well.<br><br>5. We implemented a weather system. Rain, snow, wind – it’s all there!<br><br>6. ANIMALS!! (Nuff said)<br><br>7. Faster fast travel. Just open your map and you can instantly travel to any unlocked fast travel station.<br><br>8. Revamped the map. It now provides lots of additional information and you’ve got more control over what it shows.<br><br>There’s a ton of other stuff, but your dad is yelling at me to get back to work, so I’d better wrap this up. I’ll hit you up on the other side as you come across new features.

Hey there Desmond! As you'll see from the date of this email, you've been in the Animus for a few days now. But don't worry!! I've been staying on top of your vitals. Not even a blip!

Shaun is REALLY getting on my nerves!!! You’d think with everything that’s going on, the guy would stop being such a douche! Maybe he thinks it’s funny. Or maybe it’s part of his snarky British “charm”. Or maybe it’s how he deals with the stress. Whatever it is, it’s getting old real fast. We’ve got enough to worry about – you know, end of the world and everything... You’d think he’d show a little restraint or maturity or SOMETHING. Sorry... not like you need to hear me venting. You’ve got enough on your plate. Please don’t say anything to him, though!!!

William's not the most diplomatic man, I’ll give you that. But he cares about you very much. When you were under - during that whole bit with 16 - he never left your side. Even slept in the same room when we put down for the night. Anyway – don’t mean to be a busybody. Just didn’t want you to stay sore with him. Not too sore, anyway. The man means well - even if he's got an odd way of showing it.

CONNOR'S PIECE OF EDEN

Id: [0x0006CBFC]
Interesting! The sphere used by Connor during his “spirit journey” is clearly first civilization in origin. It appears to function as some sort of temporal calculator. It's essentially a crystal ball - but one that actually works. This can't be coincidental... Which begs the question: are there others out there?

HAYTHAM'S AMULET

Though I suppose Haytham's amulet is TECHNICALLY a Piece of Eden, it's not particularly exciting. It functions as a key and, well, that's about it. I know, I know... we're all used to these things being incredibly powerful (and thus rather dangerous). But this one is neither. Is it weird I'm disappointed? That said, it's still critical to our mission. So I suppose that counts for something!

We've got a visitor down here. It's Juno. She's been appearing every now and then. Sort of flits through the air - reminds us to guard you well, find the key, blah blah - and then POOF - disappears. At first we thought it was just a another holographic recording... But then your father called her some rather choice words - and she glared at him. Honest! Swiveled those eyes in his directions and frowned. Creeped me out.<br><br>I don't know if she's reaching out to us from the past, if some part of her is actually still conscious, or if maybe she's inside the Apple, like some evil genie. Whatever it is... gives me the creeps. <br><br>And on that note: Happy Halloween!

Good Lord, Rebecca -- with all the "fixes" and "updates" and "improvements" you supposedly put into this recent software revision, one would think you would have had the decency to include a British English dictionary in the spellchecker. Some of us prefer to use PROPER language when corresponding. The database keeps trying to replace the letter s with zed in certain words. And it's declared war on the letter u as well. Realise becomes realize and colour becomes color. Wrong wrong wrong! <br><br>It's all rather ethnocentric, if you ask me. Also quite against the principles of the Assassin Brotherhood, last I checked. And here I thought we were meant to be an all inclusive bunch...

Shaun’s continuing his search for additional power sources. I’m working to coordinate with the other cells – have them doing recon and watching for Abstergo. Rebecca’s been monitoring your sessions. I’m hoping to duplicate some of the recordings and send them to other cells for further research. Also hoping there’s a way to bypass some of these memories, but synchronization seems to dictate you progress in chronological order. Hopefully some day we'll have a way to move through memories more quickly. Would certainly save us a lot of time in situations like this.

HAYTHAM'S BLADES

Id: [0x0006CC29]
I’ve been doing some digging on Haytham’s blades. Still not 100% sure where they came from. My initial instinct was he started out as an Assassin – I believe his father was one, in fact. But it appears he was a Templar from pretty early on. Maybe he took them from someone. It’s happened before. And they’re quite handy. I’m surprised more Templars haven’t put them to use. Pretty easy to build a pair if you know what you’re doing...

A Mason is oblig'd by his Tenure, to- UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCE- OBEY AND BALANCE THE MORAL LAW; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious Libertine. But though in ancient Times Masons were charg'd in every Country, THE GLOBE OVER,  to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet 'tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their particular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions, BE IT CHRISTIANITY OF THE WEST or BUDDHISM OF THE EAST, they may be distinguish'd; whereby Masonry becomes the Center of Union, and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain'd at a perpetual Distance.

A MASON IS A PEACEABLE SUBJECT UNDER THE CIVIL POWERS, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be concern'd in Plots an Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undutifully to inferior Magistrates; for as Masonry hath been always injured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion, SO ANCIENT KINGS AND PRINCES FROM ON HIGH have been much dispos'd to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and Loyalty, whereby they practically answer'd the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promoted the Honour of the Fraternity, WHOEVER FLOURISH'D WHEN THE SUN SETS IN TIME OF PEACE. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State he is not to be countenanced in his Rebellion, HOWEVER HE MAY BE PITIED AS ANY UNHAPPY OR RIGHT MAN; and, if convicted of no other Crime though the Loyal Brotherhood must and ought to disown his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being, they cannot expel him from the Lodge, and his Relation to it remains indefeasible.

A LODGE IS A HIGHEST OF PLACE WHERE MASONS ASSEMBLE AND WORK; Hence that Assembly, or duly organized Society of Masons, is call'd a Lodge, and every Brother ought to belong to one, AND TO BE SUBJECT AND UNDER ITS BALANCED BY-LAWS AND THE GENERAL REGULATIONS. It is either particular or general, and will be best understood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the General or Grand Lodge hereunto annex'd. In ancient Times, no Master or Fellow could be absent from it especially when warned to appear at it, without incurring a severe Censure, until it appear'd to the Master and Wardens that pure Necessity hinder'd him.<br><br>The persons admitted Members of a LODGE MUST BE GOOD, TRUE AND RIGHT MEN, free-born, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen granted membership, NO WOMEN LEFT TO ENTER, no immoral or scandalous men, but of good Report.

Id: [0x0006CDCE]
All preferment among Masons is grounded upon real Worth and personal Merit only; that so the Lords may be well served, the Brethren not put to Shame, nor the Royal Craft despis'd: Therefore no Master or Warden is chosen by Seniority, BUT FOR HIS MERIT AS SEEN FROM ABOVE BY THE ALL-SEEING EYE. It is impossible to describe these things in Writing, and every Brother must attend in his Place, and learn them in a WAY PECULIAR TO THIS FRATERNITY AS DECREED BY THE DOUBLE HEADED EAGLE OF THE EAST: Only Candidates may know that no Master should take an Apprentice unless he has Sufficient Employment for him, and unless he be a perfect Youth having no Maim or Defects in his Body that may render him incapable of learning the Art of serving his Master's Lord, and of being made a Brother true to the MORAL STANDARDS AND RIGHTS OF KINGS, and then a Fellow-Craft in due Time, even after he has served such a Term of Years as the Custom of the Country directs; and that he should be descended of honest Parents; that so, when otherwise qualifi'd he may arrive to the Honour of being the Warden, and then the Master of the Lodge, the Grand Warden, and at length the Grand Master of all the Lodges, according to his Merit.<br><br>No Brother can be a Warden until he has pass'd the part of a Fellow-Craft; nor a Master until he has acted as a Warden, nor Grand Warden until he has been Master of a Lodge, nor Grand Master unless he has been a Fellow Craft before his Election, who is also to be nobly born, or a Gentleman of the best Fashion, or some eminent Scholar, or some curious Architect, or other Artist, descended of honest Parents, and who is of similar great Merit in the Opinion of the Lodges. And for the better, and easier, and more honourable Discharge of his Office, the Grand Master has the Power to choose his own Deputy Grand Master, who must be then, or must have been formerly, the Master of a particular Lodge, and has the Privilege of acting whatever the Grand Master, his Principal should act; unless the said Principal be present, or interpose his Authority by a Letter.<br><br>These Rulers and Governors, supreme and subordinate, of the ancient Lodge, are to be obey'd in their respective Stations by all the Brethren, according to the old Charges and Regulations, with all Humility, Reverence, Love and Alacrity, WITH ALL MASONS UNDER THE VISION ON THE BROTHERHOOD.

Both the Master and the MASONS RECEIVING THEIR LAWFUL AND JUST WAGES RIGHTLY, shall be faithful to the Lord and honestly finish their Work, whether Task or journey; nor put the work to Task that hath been accustomed to Journey.<br><br>None shall discover Envy at the Prosperity of a Brother, nor supplant him, or put him out of his Work, if he be capable to finish the same; FOR NO MAN CAN BE LEFT TO FINISH ANOTHER'S Work so much to the Lord's Profit, unless he be thoroughly acquainted with the Designs and Draughts of him that began it.<br><br>When a Fellow-Craftsman is chosen Warden of the Work under the Master, he shall be true both to Master and Fellows, shall carefully oversee the Work in the Master's Absence to the Lord's profit; and his Brethren shall obey him.<br><br>All Masons employed shall meekly receive their Wages without Murmuring or Mutiny, and not desert the Master till the Work is finish'd.<br><br>A younger Brother shall be instructed in working, to prevent spoiling the Materials for want of Judgment, and for increasing and continuing of brotherly love.<br><br>All the Tools used in working shall be approved by the Grand Lodge.

1. In the Lodge while constituted<br><br>You are not to hold private Committees, or separate Conversation without Leave from the Master, nor to talk of anything impertinent or unseemly, nor interrupt the Master or Wardens, or any Brother speaking to the Master: NOR BEHAVE YOURSELF LUDICROUSLY OR AS A LOW JESTER WHILE THE LODGE IS ENGAGED IN WHAT IS SERIOUS AND SOLEMN; nor use any unbecoming Language upon any Pretense whatsoever; but to pay due Reverence to your Master, Wardens, and Fellows, and put them to Worship.<br><br>If any Complaint be brought, the Brother found guilty shall stand to the Award and Determination of the Lodge, who are the proper and competent Judges of all such Controversies (unless you carry it by Appeal to the Grand Lodge), and to whom they ought to be referr'd, unless a Lord's Work be hinder'd the meanwhile, in which Case a particular Reference may be made; but you must never go to Law about what concerneth Masonry, without an absolute necessity apparent to the Lodge.<br><br>2. Behaviour after the Lodge is over and the Brethren not gone<br><br>You may enjoy yourself with innocent Mirth, treating one another according to Ability, but avoiding all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying anything offensive, or that may forbid an easy and free Conversation, for that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Purposes. Therefore no private Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the Lodge, far less any Quarrels about Religion, or Nations, or State Policy, we being only, as Masons, OF THE CATHOLIC RELIGION TO THE LEFT OF ALL NATIONS, Tongues, Kindreds, and Languages, and are resolv'd against all Politics, as what never yet conduct'd to the Welfare of the Lodge, nor ever will. This charge has been strictly enjoin'd and obser'd; but especially ever since the Reformation in Britain, or the Dissent and Secession of these Nations from the Communion of Rome.<br><br>3. Behaviour when Brethren meet without strangers, but not in a Lodge formed<br><br>You are to salute one another in a courteous Manner, as you will be instructed, calling each other Brother, freely giving mutual instruction as shall be thought expedient, without being ever seen or overheard, and without encroaching upon each other, or derogating from that Respect which is due to any Brother, were he not Mason: For though all Masons are as Brethren upon the same Level, yet Masonry takes no Honour from a man that he had before; nay, rather it adds to his Honour, especially if he has deserve well of the Brotherhood, who must give Honour to whom it is due, and avoid ill Manners.<br><br>4. Behaviour in presence of strangers not Masons<br><br>You shall be cautious in your Words and Carriage, that the most penetrating Stranger shall not be able to discover or find out what is not proper to be intimated, and sometimes you shall divert a Discourse, and manage it prudently for the Honour of the worshipful Fraternity.<br><br>5. Behaviour at Home, and in your Neighborhood<br><br>You are to act as becomes a moral and wise Man; particularly not to let your Family, Friends and Neighbors know the Concern of the Lodge, &c., but wisely to consult your own Honour, and that of the ancient Brotherhood, for reasons not to be mention'd here You must also consult your Health, by not continuing together too late, or too long from Home, after Lodge Hours are past; and by avoiding of Gluttony or Drunkenness, that your Families be not neglected or injured, nor you disabled from working.<br><br>6. Behaviour towards a strange Brother<br><br>You are cautiously to examine him, in such a Method as Prudence shall direct you, that you may not be impos'd upon by an ignorant, false Pretender, whom you are to reject with contempt and Derision, and beware of giving him any Hints of Knowledge.<br><br>But if you discover him to be a true and genuine Brother, you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in Want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be relieved; you must employ him some days, or else recommend him to be employ'd. But you are not charged to do beyond your ability, only to prefer a poor Brother, that is a good Man and true before any other poor People in the same Circumstance.<br><br>Finally, All these Charges you are to observe, and also those that shall be recommended to you in another Way; cultivating Brotherly Love, THE FOUNDATION AND THE ETERNALLY CROWING CAP-STONE, the Cement and Glory of this Ancient Fraternity, avoiding all wrangling and quarreling, all Slander and Backbiting, nor permitting others to slander any honest Brother, but defending his Character, and doing him all good Offices, as far as is consistent with your Honour and Safety, and no farther. And if any of them do you Injury you must apply to your own or his Lodge, and from thence you may appeal to the Grand Lodge, at the Quarterly Communication and from thence to the annual Grand Lodge, as has been the ancient laudable Conduct but when the Case cannot be otherwise decided, and patiently listening to the honest and friendly Advice of Master and Fellows when they would PREVENT YOUR GOING TO LAW RIGHT- OR WRONG- WITH STRANGERS, or would excite you to put a speedy Period to all Lawsuits, so that you may mind the Affair of Masonry with the more Alacrity and Success; but with respect to Brothers or Fellows at Law, the Master and Brethren should kindly offer their Mediation, which ought to be thankfully submitted to by the contending Brethren; and if that submission is impracticable, they must, however, carry on their Process, or Lawsuit, without Wrath and Rancor (not In the common way) saying or doing nothing which may hinder Brotherly Love, and good Offices to be renew'd and continu'd; that all may see the benign Influence of Masonry, as all true Masons have done from the beginning of the World, and will do to the End of Time.<br><br>Amen, so mote it be.

Charles Lee was a British soldier who went on to be a major figure in the Revolutionary War.<br><br>Lee's father was a Colonel in the British army, and started his son off in a military career early. He was sent to a military academy in Switzerland during his formative years, and then in 1746, Lee became an ensign in his father's regiment.<br><br>Lee was sent to the colonies in 1755 to fight in the French and Indian war. He served under Edward Braddock and then later at Fort Ticonderoga, where he was injured in the fighting. Lee recovered, and later fought at Fort Niagara. I’d always thought there were a lot of Fort fights fought. He finished his time in the colonies with the British conquest of Montreal.<br><br>Lee returned to England in 1760, possibly because he was seeking career advancement. He was named a Major in 1761 and was sent to fight the Spanish in Portugal. Though his service record there was good, Lee didn't receive praise on his return home - in fact, he was retired from the army at half-pay. After that, Lee became a vocal critic of military higher-ups, and the British Prime Minister - and found that his military career had (inexplicably!) completely stalled.<br><br>**<br><br>Frustrated with his lack of advancement with the British, Lee moved back to New York in 1773. He quickly became a supporter of the revolutionary cause and in June of 1775 he joined the Continental Army with the rank of Major General. <br><br>Lee began his service under the command of George Washington - which grated, since Lee had some hopes of being named Commander-in-Chief of the army himself. Given Lee's experience he might have had a point, but he also had his drawbacks. Most notable was his temper - Lee was quick to anger, and had a habit of being very vocally and publicly angry when he didn't get his way. Bosses LOVE that.<br><br>Lee also had some rather odd personal quirks. He was exceptionally fond of dogs, and was continually surrounded by them, in particular his much-loved Pomeranian.  Never trust a man continually surrounded by tiny dogs. He was also vain and liked tailored suits, but rarely washed them, meaning that he smelled little better than his animals (and worse, according to some.)<br><br>Despite his failings, Lee was both a competent leader and popular with the troops. Washington recognized it, and named one of the forts on the Hudson River "Fort Lee", in his honour. If Washington was hoping that just naming a fort after him smooth over their rocky relationship, it amazingly didn't work.<br><br>In fact, as time went on, Lee became less and less fond of Washington, and became reluctant to follow his orders at all. When Washington retreated across New York and New Jersey in 1776, he sent several commands to Lee to follow him, which Lee did, but very slowly. Which may be what resulted in him being left behind and captured by the British in 1776. Still. It’s understandable. He probably had to stop every five minutes to let his bloody dogs piss in a hedge.<br><br>Fortunately for Lee, he'd resigned his commission in the British army shortly after taking on his role in the Continental Army. That meant instead of being tried for being a deserter, his imprisonment in New York was more of an inconvenience. He was wined and dined by the British, allowed to have whomever he wanted as a dinner guest. It was basically a bed and breakfast. In return, Lee gave up information about the state of the Continental Army.

Maybe he’d forgotten his doggie treats in the tent and needed to go and get them. Washington swept in and took command, turning a complete rout of his army into a draw, and Lee received a very thorough and public dressing down. Afterward, Lee demanded an apology or a court-martial to clear his name. <br><br>Washington chose the court-martial, which didn't go as Lee had hoped. He was found guilty of "misbehaviour before the enemy, making a shameful and disorderly retreat, and disrespect to the commander-in-chief". He was only given a year's suspension for the crimes, but by the time the year was over, he'd been so vocal in his criticism of Washington that Congress removed him from the army permanently.<br><br>Lee retired to his estate in Virginia, passing his time breeding more dogs. After his death, he was given a full military funeral - getting all the respect he craved, too late to do anything with it.

Benjamin Church was a talented physician, and essentially the first Surgeon General of the US Army.<br><br>Church was born in Rhode Island, and graduated from Harvard University in 1754 - so you're meeting him here just out of college.

But he was a member of the Sons of Liberty, and his local Committee of Correspondence.

That's when he was caught sending coded messages to the British forces in Boston.  Rather than being hanged for treason, Church was simply jailed and later exiled. That took some fast talking on his part. His defense was that he was actually HELPING the Continental Army by exaggerating troop estimates and gunpowder stores. That’s some quick thinking.<br><br>Lucky for Church the Continental Army only ever knew about the one coded letter. More modern research has showed that he'd been ferrying papers to the British for some time, possibly to pay off some of his debts.<br><br>Incidentally, his expensive mansion was seized by the newly formed American government and sold to pay off war debts - but not until after it was ransacked by angry rebels. That may seem like poetic justice, but it's somewhat unfair - at the time Church wasn't even living there. He'd left it to his wife, who he'd abandoned for another woman.<br><br>Seems he made a habit of betrayal. What a catch.

Here's a name even you should recognise - George Washington, who will go on to be the leader of the army during the American Revolution, and the first President of the United States. <br><br>I was going to say you probably know everything I'm going to tell you but that would be a lie. What you know is that George Washington has a lot of things named after him, and anything else you learned in school you forgot because you thought you'd never use it in real life. (You should call your history teacher and tell her she was right all along.)<br><br>George Washington was the son of a planter from Virginia. He was raised with little education, but was ambitious, teaching himself mostly from books. <br><br>Washing started in business early, speculating on land starting at the age of 18. When he was 20, his older brother died, leaving him the heir of the family plantation at Mount Vernon - where he lived until his death, and where you can still visit his grave today.<br><br>Washington got his military start during the French and Indian War, leading an expedition to Fort Duquesne in 1754 - a destination he never reached, having surrendered at Fort Necessity. The next year, Washington headed to Fort Duquesne again, this time as a guide for Edward Braddock during the ill-fated Braddock Expedition. Washington went as a volunteer, hoping that working for Braddock would get him a track to military promotion. Though the battle was a rout, Washington earned credit for organizing the retreat, and later that year he was made a Colonel in charge of the Virginia militia.<br><br>Washington completely revamped the militia, with hopes that under his organization and training they would be accepted into the British military. They never were. Washington resigned his post in 1758. I won't say the snub led to his contempt for the British, but snubs rarely help. <br><br>By the late 1760s, Washington had become active in political life - taking on a role in the Virginia House of Burgesses. He went on to be a member of the Continental Congress, and when war broke out in 1775, he was Congress's choice to lead the army. At the time Washington said, "I do not think myself equal to the command I am honored with." Which I'm sure inspired complete confidence in everyone who heard it. Imagine if you were on an airplane and the captain opened with that.<br><br>It's possible Washington was being falsely modest, but the fact is this: he wasn't a military genius, and he knew it. (Though I'm sure it hurts your American pride to hear me say he wasn't perfect.) Washington had several narrow misses where the army could have easily been obliterated - at Manhattan, and again at Brandywine - among others.<br><br>Washington won an early victory he broke the siege of Boston, but he then made the disastrous move of fortifying New York - a city he couldn't defend without a navy he didn't have. Even you can work that one out. He spent the latter half of 1776 retreating across New York and New Jersey, losing battle after battle, until Christmas, when he pulled off a successful surprise attack the Hessian troops at Trenton. <br><br>(And while that battle makes for some famous paintings, and it did rally the flagging confidence of the public, it was a minor victory in the war.)<br><br>**<br><br>Washington's lack of skill didn't go unremarked, either. Charles Lee lost faith in him completely - never going quite so far as to disobey Washington's orders, but not following them promptly either.  Then, in 1777-78, Washington had to defend himself against the Conway Cabal, which threatened to replace him with General Horatio Gates.<br><br>However, Washington's strength lay in politics, and leading the army was as much about politics as it was about winning battles. Washington had to negotiate between the varying interests of the army, the individual colonies, and Congress - and not just for instructions on how to wage the war, but also for basic supplies for the troops. By all accounts he must have been extremely patient - trying to get politicians to give you anything is like trying to get a dog to give up a bone. (Actually, my money would be on the dogs, who will occasionally listen to reason.)<br><br>Whatever the criticisms of Washington's military strengths, the bottom line is that he won (eventually).  When the revolution ended, he was the unanimous choice for President, a credit to the fact that he managed to both win the war and not alienate anyone in Congress.  <br><br>Of course, if you're looking for something to criticize Washington for, you don't have to look far - he ordered the total ruin of Indigenous settlements during the Sullivan Expedition, not to mention he was a plantation owner, which meant he owned more than 200 slaves (And while, yes, his will did provide for them being freed - after both he and his wife were dead and wouldn't need them anymore. I don't really consider that particularly altruistic.)<br><br>Oh, am I ending on a low note? Sorry, I'm here to teach you history, not soothe your sense of national pride.

Nicholas Biddle was an ambitious young sailor who became one of the first captains of the Continental Navy.   <br><br>Biddle joined the Royal Navy in 1770 (I mean the British side), but when the American Revolution started he offered his services to the Continental Congress. So a traitor, then - though it’s funny how you lot don’t generally see it that way. Anyway, while he was only a midshipman for the British, Congress quickly gave him command of his own ship, the Franklin. In 1776 was offered an even better deal - command of a brand new ship, named the Randolph.<br><br>History's mute on the reasons behind Biddle's rise to prominence. However, I think I might be able to solve the mystery - we saw Church recruiting him when Connor stopped at Nantucket.  <br><br>Biddle eventually became a privateer for the Continental Congress, patrolling British shipping routes, harassing their ships and keeping the spoils from any he could capture. He had a reputation as an excellent captain –he divided the spoils evenly, and never used corporal punishment against his crew. What a softy. Pitiful, really. Though I think you can see why that would be a job perk.<br><br>**<br>It seems that Biddle was angling to be head of the Continental Navy - but like several other officers of the time, he didn't want to serve under Washington. <br>Incidentally the circumstances of Biddle’s death - and the exact reason his ship exploded - have always been something of an historical mystery.

William Johnson was a land speculator, and Britain's principal treaty negotiator with the Indigenous peoples in the northern part of the colonies - particularly the Iroquois.<br><br>Johnson was born in Ireland, but moved to the colonies in 1738 to look after his Uncle's property on the Mohawk River. However, it wasn't long before Johnson branched out into business for himself, acquiring property on the opposite side of the river and setting up a sawmill and trading post, which he named "Mount Johnson". Which to me always sounds like mating instructions from a caveman. In 1743 he moved to an even larger parcel of land which he named "Fort Johnson". (He may have been an excellent businessman, but it's possible he lacked an imagination.)<br><br>Johnson befriended the Indigenous peoples in the area, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka - whose language he learned. His respect for their customs helped him rise to prominence as liaison between the Iroquois peoples and the British government. Johnson was named Superintendent of Indian Affairs in 1756. As a contact who knows the land and its people, he's probably the best you'll find.<br><br>**<br><br>In addition to treaty negotiations, Johnson was in charge of recruiting and leading Iroquois fighters during the French and Indian War. He only fought in one battle, but he was rewarded handsomely for his service - £5000 and a Baronetcy. That was a little above average for most people involved in that battle.<br><br>He continued his close ties with the Kanien'kehá:ka and in 1760 they gave him land totaling more than 300 square kilometres as a thanks for his work. <br><br>However, Johnson burned some bridges in 1768 when he negotiated the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. He took much more land than the British had asked for - a windfall for him, since he could then speculate on it - but rather a tough sell to the Indigenous nations who lived on the land. The treaty caused a war in Virginia (known as Dunmore's War). In an effort to stop more bloodshed (and possibly to cover his own arse), Johnson called for more negotiations - this time at Johnson Hall, in 1774.

I guess publicising that he was killed while threatening to murder treaty negotiators would probably have caused some political tensions, to put it mildly. I suppose a blow to the head, for example, could be described as a very heavy stroke.

In 1754, John Pitcairn was a young captain in the British Marine corps. He fought in the French and Indian war, but I can't find much about his postings. He's listed as being on the HMS Lancaster during the capture of Louisbourg - that's in Canada.  No record of him being on the 'American' side of the colonies but it seems he did some covert work as well - that would explain the lack of details. <br><br>Pitcairn was promoted to Major in 1771, and he gained a reputation for being well-liked by his subordinates - and praised by his enemies. That's a difficult trick to pull off. Maybe he had a lovely smile.<br><br>**<br><br>When Thomas Gage sent British troops to Lexington and Concord, he picked Pitcairn for the job, figuring the rebels would listen to him when it came time to talk. Instead, Pitcairn was man in charge when his Marines killed 8 militiamen at the Battle of Lexington, starting the Revolutionary war - severely damaging his reputation as a peacemaker. Multiple deaths can do that.<br><br>Pitcairn's report on the battles said he had ordered his men not to fire unless the rebels fired first, but that didn't stop the rumours that he'd commanded the attack.  History's taken a kinder view - Pitcairn's now considered, as one Patriot described him, "a good man in a bad cause".

Possibly it was a little of both. Pitcairn's story is that he wanted to find Adams and Hancock to negotiate with them - and he would have been the ideal person to do it. I'm still puzzled as to why he'd try negotiating a truce with an army at his back, though. It sort of sends the wrong message, don't you think?

Thomas Hickey was an Irish-born member of the British Army. He arrived in Boston in 1752, but it wasn't long before he was assigned to William Johnson's personal guard, apparently at Johnson's request (possibly because their families were connected in Ireland, or maybe he found the name ‘Hickey’ funny, the record isn't clear.)<br><br> Hickey served under Johnson during the French and Indian war, but then he left the army after being written up several times for disorderly conduct. After 1760, Hickey disappears from the historical record for several years. I do, however, have several mentions in William Johnson's household accounts of payments made to "T.H.". It's possible Hickey was working for him as a spy. If so, he should really have developed some tougher codes to crack.<br><br>**<br><br>Hickey resurfaces during the rebel occupation of New York in 1776. He became a member of George Washington's personal bodyguard - commonly known among the soldiers as the "Life Guard". I'd imagine it took some pretty clever political maneuvering to get him there, given his record. I've seen some suggestions that he was a well-respected member of the Connecticut Militia, but I can't find a service record for him there (and I have my doubts Hickey could ever have been described as 'well-respected').<br><br>In any case, Hickey immediately betrayed his commission by planning to assassinate Washington. Maybe T.H. stood for That Hooligan.

That's an interesting interpretation of events, but since New York didn't have stadium seating at the time, I doubt many of the soldiers had a great view of the execution. The important message for them was "Don't be a traitor, you'll get hanged", not the niceties of who was on the gibbet.

Edward 'Bulldog' Braddock was the Major General placed in charge of British troops at the beginning of the French and Indian War, probably because he had a nickname like ‘Bulldog’.<br><br>Braddock was serving as the acting Governor of Gibraltar when he received the command in North America. He was given control of two regiments of Regulars and assigned to win back Fort Duquesne from the French (known as the Braddock Expedition) - as part of a larger attack on the French colonies on the continent.<br><br>Braddock had been well-liked as the governor in Gibraltar, but things changed once he reached North America. He had been known for keeping strict order among his troops, but it seems he went beyond that into brutality. He gained a reputation for being quick-tempered and cruel. He also displayed a contempt for non-British soldiers that alienated the colonial militia he was trying to recruit. So a cruel, racist bulldog, then. They’re my least favourite type of bulldog.<br><br>Braddock took a bullet to the chest during a battle in 1755, rumour has it from one of his own soldiers.  Which is a job hazard when you're nasty to the people around you and they all have guns. Sounds like the bulldog may have been put down.<br><br>**<br><br>It was George Washington who carried Braddock from the field on his sash - which Braddock then entrusted to Washington. (That 'carrying' bit may sound a bit odd, but that sash is bigger than it looks - more than three metres long - and doubled as a field hammock. It says something about officers that they'd wear a piece of clothing designed to carry their body off the battlefield - which would also single them out for getting shot at. The ways of war are mysterious.)  Braddock died of his injuries a few days later; Washington kept the sash.<br><br>Here's something interesting - because of concerns that enemy soldiers would desecrate Braddock's body, he was buried under the road, so the wagons would run over the earth and hide the gravesite.  In 1804, roadworkers rediscovered the remains and they were moved to another site - which is now marked by a marble monument.

APPLES OF EDEN

Id: [0x0006CF10]
These are some of the most sought-after technological remnants from the ever-mysterious First Civilization. The apples were originally created by our friendly First Civ masters in order to control the huddled masses - that is, humanity. These artifacts can control minds and create illusions that pretty much everyone is susceptible to. They're also repositories of First Civilization knowledge - meaning if you know how to access them, you can use the Apples to develop incredibly advanced technology. <br><br>Naturally, the raw power of the apples have made them a target of ambitious and unscrupulous types for centuries, and have been used by leaders throughout history to influence the course of important events. The Assassin mentor Al Mualim had one in Masyaf in the 12th century - but he succumbed to its power and began to use it for control, rather than research. (Turns out that old saying about absolute power corrupting absolutely is true). <br><br>It eventually passed into the hands of Al Mualim’s star pupil, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, a Levantine Assassin who unlocked its true power and purpose, then had the good sense to lock it away in a vault, far from greedy hands. But nothing this valuable stays put for long, and in the final years of the 16th century Templars working for Queen Elizabeth of England sent out an envoy to find and recover it.  <br><br>This apple – Apple number two, to be precise - ultimately made its way into Abstergo’s hands in the 20th century, and was the lynchpin of their current plan to subdue and suppress all free thought and action in the world … until they blew the damn thing up in a pretty dodgy experiment. Since that time we learned of the existence of at least five more apples, the sixth of which once belonged to the Italian assassin Ezio Auditore, and which you, Desmond, were kind enough to recover for us. So thanks for that. (and you might wish to make a note of the date – my thanks are few and far between…)<br><br>This sixth apple has an equally storied history, and first came to attention of modern Templars after the Ottoman Mehmet II used it to compel the besieged Byzantines to open the gates of Constantinople and let their enemies walk right in. A few decades on, Mehmet’s grandson, Cem – a young man with loose Templar allegiances – stole the apple and hid it in an abandoned Templar archive on Cyprus, hoping to use it as a bargaining chip in his dealings with the powerful Rodrigo Borgia. But this parlay ended badly for the wayward Ottoman prince. He was captured by the Hospitallers on Rhodes and tortured until he revealed the apple’s location. In 1486 Rodrigo sent a group of Templars to locate the apple and deliver it to him.<br><br>But on the eve of this apple’s arrival in Venice in 1488, Ezio and his Assassins intercepted it and claimed it as their own. Over the next two decades the sixth apple changed hands a few times, falling into the clutches of both Girolamo Savonarola and Cesare Borgia, before finding its penultimate resting-place in a vault below Santa Maria in Aracoeli. I say penultimate because it's in our hands, and I’ll be damned if I know where it’s going to end up after the mess we’re in now.<br><br>Whatever happens, I have to give our ancient ancestors their due. It is incredible to consider that, millennia after the First Civ has been wiped from the earth, the apples are still working perfectly – a fact that is nothing short of amazing, given that I need to replace my mobile phone every other year, and that bloody fridge is still on the blink.

Okay okay. Sorry. So much for injecting a little pre-Christmas cheer into these otherwise dour proceedings...<br><br>The GOOD NEWS is that far as I can tell, the Eye-Abstergo launch has been postponed - permanently. With Vidic dead (thanks to dear Desmond) and the Apple of Eden still safely in our possession, there's no way they'll make their date. I suppose there's always the chance they'll manage to retrieve another Apple and start the whole process over - but all of our intel says they've got no leads. We're safe from that particular threat - at least for now.<br><br>The BAD NEWS is that we've got less than 48 hours to open the temple doors. Whatever's meant to happen on the 21st (and it's likely a whole lot worse than Eye-Abstergo) - I think we'd all like very much to ensure it DOESN'T.<br><br>-----Original Message-----<br>FROM: WILLIAM MILES<br>SENT: Dec. 19th, 2012 10:40<br>TO: D.

Paine was political pamphleteer, originally from England. His book "Common Sense" was an argument for American independence - and became one of the most popular books in American history, mainly because Americans thought it was a book about common sense, and on some level knew they needed it.<br><br>At the time, most of the literature about independence was written by lawyers and politicians - in the kind of self-important florid language that can only be understood by college graduates or written by me. However, "Common Sense" lived up to its title - it was written in straightforward language, so basically anyone could understand its arguments (even people who couldn't read - the book was so popular there were numerous public readings of the text, making it an early audiobook, in many ways.)<br><br>While the book wasn't what convinced Congress of the value of independence (they already knew), it did cause a groundswell of popular support, and that was important because Congress needed the public on their side - and they needed to convince soldiers to fight for them. Common Sense did both.<br><br>I don't have any record of Connor actually meeting Paine, but I thought you'd like to know about him as his works played such a crucial role in the revolution. Yes, I put this at the end so you'd read the whole thing before finding that out. I can be a bastard that way.

Casimir Pulaski (or to use the Polish spelling, Kazimierz Pulaski) was a Polish noble and cavalry leader who fought on the side of the rebels during the American Revolution.<br><br>Pulaski was a fighter in the Polish Resistance during the late 1760s and early 1770s. Unfortunately for him, he was on the losing side and had to flee to France. Poor guy. Having to flee to France. There, he met Benjamin Franklin, who was keeping an eye out for any experienced military commanders who could help the rebel war effort. Franklin wasted no time in sending Pulaski in the direction of George Washington. <br><br>Pulaski joined the Continental Army in 1777 and made himself immediately useful at the Battle of Brandywine - where he prevented George Washington from being surrounded by the British. He probably saved Washington's life - along with the lives of many in of the Continental Army. As a thank-you, Pulaski was named a Brigadier General and placed in command of the Continental Army's cavalry - which at the time was extremely small, scattered, and mainly used for scouting.  <br><br>After some tensions with his superior officers, Pulaski resigned his commission and was allowed to start again elsewhere, training a small corps of lancers and infantry that - for reasons which should be obvious - became known as "Pulaski's Legion".

Simon Girty was a hunter and trader in the Ohio Valley, who worked for the British during the American Revolution.<br><br>Girty was born near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at a time when it was contested territory between the European Colonists and the local Indigenous nations. When Girty was in his early teens, his family was captured by a Seneca war party, so Girty spent several years as an adoptee, learning the Seneca language (and probably several other languages as well).  Those skills would come in handy - Girty eventually became an interpreter, most famously between the Iroquois and the British during the later years of the American Revolution. <br><br>I don't mean 'famously' in a good way, by the way. Girty had a reputation as a heavy drinker, with a volatile temper and boorish manners. During one of his raids on the Continental Army, some of the Delaware in the party tortured a Patriot colonel to death. Depending on which account you believe, Girty either pleaded for the colonel's life - or encouraged his torturers and taunted him as he died. <br><br>Of course, since Girty was on the losing side of the war and not a particularly sympathetic figure, most history books take the dimmer view of his actions.

Reginald Birch was a London merchant, the son of another London merchant (who, conveniently enough, also had the last name Birch. It seems it was one of those hard-to-put-your-finger-on things that ran in the family). <br><br>Birch started in business for himself at an early age. By the time he was in his mid-20s, he already owned several merchant ships, mainly dealing with the tea trade to the American colonies. That's pretty good going, seeing as by the time most people are in their mid-20s they don’t even own a shirt. I have him as part owner of the Providence, among others. Later in life, Birch also owned several businesses in and around London. He was a member of White's, which was a posh Gentleman's club in London - and generally a well-known and respected man-about-town.<br><br>From what I can tell, Birch met Haytham Kenway while working for his father, Edward. They were introduced at White's while Haytham was still quite young.  Birch would eventually take over Haytham's education - tutoring him while on a tour of Europe in the 1730s. From what we've seen in the Animus, it seems their friendship continued into adulthood - with them working together as members of the Assassins. <br><br>**<br><br>So, further evidence (that is, the Animus) reveals that Birch was a Templar all along - likely a Grand Master in the order. I'll be honest and say I really didn't see that coming. And that is startlingly honest of me. In fact, I instantly regret it. In any case I'm still making the connections on how exactly this all relates to the Assassins - our records from the time are like a teenage back. Spotty at best. I'll update you if I find anything more.

Kaniehtí:io was a member of the Kanien'kehá:ka nation, living on the frontier lands near Boston at the time of the French and Indian War. Assassin records indicate she was the daughter of the Iakoiá:ner, or Clan Mother, and from an early age was being groomed for leadership herself. <br><br>While many in her community chose to ignore the incursions by Colonists into the area, and growing tensions between the French and British, Kaniehtí:io was convinced that they presented a very real danger.  She began to argue to anyone who would listen that the village should take action, rather than staying silent - which was contrary to the will of the clan chiefs at the time. She refused to follow their orders to remain neutral, deciding to fight back in her own way and recruiting help where she could get it - including from Haytham Kenway. <br><br>**<br><br>Kaniehtí:io 's actions during the Braddock expedition, along with her relationship with a known Templar, more or less excluded her from becoming a Clan Mother herself in adulthood.  However, it seems even after her child was born, she continued arguing for action in the war, rather than the restraint advocated by the village elders. She did, however, cut off all contact with Haytham.<br><br>It's not clear why the Templars attacked in 1760 - or what their objective might have been.  The village was nearly destroyed, but recovered over the course of several years.

You may not think it to look at him how, but this man was once the Mentor of a powerful branch of the Assassins - the Colonial Brotherhood.  <br><br>Achilles' life before he was an Assassin isn't well documented – it seems that most of the records were destroyed when the Templars nearly wiped out the order in 1763. <br><br>From what I do have, Achilles was recruited in the mid-1730s and became a Mentor in 1746. He had a gift for both recruitment and organization, so before long was head of a crew of Assassins that spanned the colonies and much of the frontier. Achilles strengthened the ties between the order and the nations of the Iroquois confederacy, particularly the Kanien'kehá:ka, though as far as our records show, Connor is the first Native American to actually become an Assassin.<br><br>**<br><br>The Brotherhood's growth came to a grinding halt in 1763, when an attack (presumably orchestrated by Haytham Kenway) wiped out 90% of the colonial Assassins in one strike. Though Achilles' correspondence with Britain shows that he was suspicious of Haytham and his intentions, there's no indication that he knew an ambush was coming - an oversight of nightmarish proportions on his part.<br><br>Achilles managed to survive the attack, but he retired from the order - until a decade had passed, and Connor convinced him to grudgingly take on one more student.

The Conway Cabal was a supposed conspiracy to unseat George Washington as the head of the Continental Army and replace him with General Horatio Gates. The fact that you’re far less familiar with the name Horatio Gates perhaps tells you how successful that was.<br><br>Thomas Conway was an Irish-born soldier who'd been educated in France. He served as a General under Washington, but corresponded frequently with Gates - mainly about how bad Washington was at his job.<br><br>Now, generally if you want to keep your job, you don’t bitch about your boss to everyone who'll listen, but apparently nobody ever told Conway that. He wouldn’t last five minutes on any social networking site. So, when Washington got wind of some things Conway had written (none of which were complimentary), it exploded in the faces of both Conway and Gates, who had to go before Congress to clear their names. (Which didn't work out for them.) <br><br>There's some historical debate as to whether "Cabal" is the right word for the whole thing - and really, it sounds more like an internal squabble to me. However, there was some very public criticism of Washington at the time, since he's just lost the battles at Germantown and Brandywine, while Gates had won a big victory at Saratoga. It's not surprising that Washington took Conway's letters as a sign that his subordinates were conspiring behind his back to replace him. <br><br>In the end, however, Washington's supporters rallied around him and the whole thing ended with Gates apologising and Conway being forced to resign.<br> <br>And that would have been it, except that despite resigning Conway remained very publicly critical of Washington. That is, until one of Washington's supporters put a stop to it - by shooting him in the mouth. Simple, effective – though not generally in the employer’s manual.

This was a network of rebel spies operating in New York and Connecticut from 1778 until the end of the American Revolution.<br><br>The group was founded after British forces left Philadelphia and re-established their headquarters in New York City. Washington knew that he needed people on the inside (I've always wanted to use that phrase, and between you and me, I also got quite a kick out of ‘rebel spies’) to report on British troop movements. He asked his newly-appointed head of intelligence, Benjamin Tallmadge, to find some spies, which Tallmadge did.<br><br>Tallmadge needed people he could trust absolutely, so he began by recruiting his childhood friends. (Nothing says friendship quite like offering someone a job that involves risking their life.) The name "Culper Ring" is taken from "Samuel Culper Sr." and "Samuel Culper Jr.", the code names of two of the ring's main informants. I don’t know who they were, but I imagine one was slightly older than the other.<br><br>The group's biggest accomplishment was probably informing Washington of a planned attack on the French forces in Rhode Island in 1780. They're also credited with uncovering Benedict Arnold's betrayal of West Point - though the evidence for that is sketchier. In any case, the ring delivered secret messages for years, with none of its members ever being captured (with one possible exception - a woman referred to as "355", whose real identity and fate isn't known.) <br><br>The group is credited for being the most effective intelligence operation in the war - on either side. You can't know how much it pains me to write that. It took AGES.

EVACUATION DAY (NEW YORK)

Id: [0x0006D00F]
Evacuation Day was the day that the British troops sailed out of New York City at the end of the American Revolution. (Not to be confused with Evacuation Day in Massachusetts - where the British sailed out of Boston Harbour, nearer to the beginning of the Revolution.)<br><br>While the Treaty of Paris formally ended the war in early September, the British took some time to pack up their belongings and leave their stronghold at New York - mainly because many Loyalists found a sudden need to leave the country, and so there were more people to carry than they originally anticipated. Plus, they probably wanted some time in Duty Free.<br><br>Of course, the British are known for being practical jokers, and so they couldn't resist getting in a few friendly parting shots. Before they left, troops nailed a Union Jack to a flagpole on the Bowling Green - and then greased the pole.  Undaunted, the Americans nailed up spikes to help them climb, managing to raise Stars-and-Stripes before the British fleet had sailed out of sight. After that, climbing a greased flag pole to tear down a Union Jack would be part of New York's Evacuation Day festivities - proving that you Americans need better hobbies.<br><br>The other British parting shot was a literal one - a British ship fired a cannonball at the crowds on Staten Island, who were jeering at the departing flotilla. Nobody was hurt - the ball fell short of the land - but it's sometimes called the last shot of the American Revolution.<br><br>Evacuation Day isn't much celebrated any more - it fell out of favour when Thanksgiving was moved to the end of November, in 1863.

SMALLPOX INNOCULATION

Id: [0x0006D012]
Smallpox was one of the scourges of the 17th and 18th centuries. The list of symptoms is thoroughly pleasant - large pustules all over your skin that are more or less guaranteed to scar, terrible fever, and vomiting. (The disease is extinct now aside from samples kept in laboratories - yet another reason to be glad we live in this modern age.)<br><br>Inoculation for smallpox in America began sometime in the early 1720s in Boston, when a preacher named Cotton Mather found out about the idea from one of his slaves. The method was simple, if rather disgusting - you find someone who has a mild case of the disease, then grind up parts of their sores, and put it under the skin of the person being inoculated (generally in a scratch between the thumb and forefinger). The second person would get a less severe form of the disease, and afterward will be immune for about 10 years.<br><br>Statistically speaking, inoculation worked, but it wasn't without its drawbacks. Smallpox in any form was extremely dangerous, and people regularly died from being inoculated. Also, because inoculating people was essentially infecting them with the disease there was always the chance that they could cause an outbreak. (A case of the cure being worse than the disease.)<br><br>It wasn't until 1796 that a less dangerous form of vaccination was introduced. A British doctor – of course he was British - named Edward Jenner discovered that being infected with cowpox (which was non-lethal) would give immunity to smallpox as well.  Jenner had made this discovery by infecting a young boy with cowpox, and then trying to infect him with smallpox (in the name of science, I'm sure the child would have been delighted to know). Given his methods, it's not surprising Jenner's findings were frowned upon by the medical establishment, and cowpox-based vaccinations didn't see wide use until sometime after 1800.

And the world as well. <br><br>I hate you. But you will save us. So I offer my hand. I will lead you to salvation.

AMERICAN POLITICS

Id: [0x0006D122]
You know, it's rather incredible the way your lunatic fringe tries to conjure the "spirit" of the Founding Fathers to support their various causes. And by incredible I mean hilarious. They hold up slave-owning, sexist, homophobes as if that's some sort of ideal to which one should aspire.<br><br>Oh - and in case you think I added that last bit for fun (as the sexism and slavery bits are already common knowledge): sodomy was a criminal offense in every one of the thirteen colonies except for Georgia and Thomas Jefferson ('champion' of personal liberty that he was) advocated for the castration of homosexuals. Lovely fellows, these founding fathers of yours. And now there's that new bit of madness with people asking for the removal of textbook references to their slave-owning...<br><br>And before you think to turn it back 'round and (rightly) point out their barbarism was inspired by English law - last I checked, two stupids don't make a smart. I thought the whole point of the Revolution was to break free of the old ways... And it certainly doesn't recommend your founders as the sort of persons one should aspire to become. Unless you aspire to become a manipulative bigot.<br><br>Lest you think I'm championing some sort of leftist agenda, I'll gladly shame the internet tough guys who celebrate the Treaty of Tripoli as well. Shame on them for thinking it shows anything other than something taken straight out of The First Grader's Guide to International Relations... Its intent wasn't to prove America wasn't a Christian nation. They were saying they weren't going to reignite the Crusades. No, that would be delayed for a couple of centuries. Now, I don't believe your founding fathers wanted to establish a theocracy. And they probably did intend for the country to be welcoming of all religions. But this isn't proof of that.<br><br>I suppose the point I'm trying to make is that people might want to spend a little less time romanticizing and manipulating the past (fat chance, that) and a bit more time focusing on how to improve the future (fatter chance still). <br><br>That's not say there isn't plenty to be learned from looking back - because there is! It's just that most of those lessons wind up ignored or perverted these days. At best it's disingenuous and unproductive. At worst (and often) it's rather dangerous.

Bowls is a variety of the old “boules” family of games derived somewhere around the 12th or 13th century. Similar to today’s pétanque and Italian bocce, the game is played by two players or teams of players with up to four people per team. Each player takes turns rolling biased balls in such a way as to stop near the “jack”, a smaller ball tossed at the beginning of a bout, or “end”. Once both players have rolled all their balls (four per side in a two-player game), points are awarded for each ball closest to the jack.

Sometimes referred to as “Cowboy Checkers,” Nine Men’s Morris is a board game that dates back at least to the Roman Empire. It is played on a board with nine stones for each player. Players alternately place stones, three stones in a row gives a player the right to remove an opposing stone.

Id: [0x0006D1B1]
Fanorona is believed to have originated in Madagascar. It is played on a nine-row by five-column board of intersecting lines. Each player places twenty-two black or white pieces on the board, then tries to capture the opponent’s pieces by moving his own along the lines and either “approaching” an opposing stone or “withdrawing” from one.

Id: [0x0006D1B2]
Checkers, or English draughts, is one of the oldest games known to man. It is played on a checkered board where two players alternate moving one of twelve flat cylindrical pieces. The goal of the game is to capture the opposing player’s pieces by jumping over them. Although simple in principle, the game's difficulty becomes apparent with experience.

Hello Desmond. The Animus allows you to control your ancestor Connor through a combination of standard and contextual buttons. Standard buttons always perform the same action. For example, holding [RB] always activates the Weapon Wheel. On the other hand, Contextual buttons change depending on the context that Connor is currently in. For example, pressing [B] can make Connor open doors, examine a clue, or take the wheel of a boat, depending on the context.

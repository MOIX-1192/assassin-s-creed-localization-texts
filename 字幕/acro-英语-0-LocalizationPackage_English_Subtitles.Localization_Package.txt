Id: [0x0006E16E]
!*I remember you. The Templar from Havana.

Id: [0x0006E183]
!*Captain Thatch, as I live and breath. And what is this magnificent Muzzle you've cultivated?

Id: [0x0006E193]
!*[Effort sounds]You could have been a Man who stood for something. But you've a Killer's Heart now. With nothing but Mettle to show for all your Blunders.

Id: [0x0006E1A1]
!*[*famous quote*]I drink Damnation to you and your Men, who are cowardly Puppies! I shall give nor take no Quarter.

Id: [0x0006E1AC]
!*There you go. Welcome back.

Id: [0x0006E1B0]
!*A Pain for the Pleasure, Thom. I'm suffering a mild stomach Complaint, going on three Days now.

Id: [0x0006E1BC]
!*Captain Kenway. You look like a Bowl of Plum Duff.

Id: [0x0006E1C0]
!*Anne, are you all right?

Id: [0x0006E1C2]
!*Here's how it goes. Torres meets with Prins carrying a Portion of the Ransom, saying the rest is close behind.

Id: [0x0006E1D8]
!*Concentrate and focus all your Senses. Look past Shadow and sound, deep into Matter, until you see and hear a kind of Shimmering.

Id: [0x0006E1DA]
!*[Breathing out with pain]What's happened with Mary? What's wrong?

Id: [0x0006E1DE]
!*How long has it been since our last Meeting, [SP][señor](Mister) Prins? A Year?

Id: [0x0006E1EC]
!*That's shite.

Id: [0x0006E1EF]
!*Guns and Steel answer louder than Sticks and spittle, Vane!

Id: [0x0006E1F6]
!*Not a bad looking Tinderbox you got there.

Id: [0x0006E20E]
!*Ach. Bloody Devils.

Id: [0x0006E226]
!*By God’s Grace, sir, you saved me. A Profusion of Thanks!

Id: [0x0006E239]
!*You're a natural Sailor, Duncan.

Id: [0x0006E248]
!*So you were Attacked by Pirates. What a terrible Ordeal. We've seen their number rise rapidly in the past few Years.

Id: [0x0006E249]
!*What do you make of this Pardon, Edward? Will Nassau survive it?

Id: [0x0006E251]
!*You Bastard...

Id: [0x0006E25D]
!*Our Helmsman's dead! Someone take the Wheel!

Id: [0x0006E273]
!*They're a miserable and randy Lot, as all Men at Sea.

Id: [0x0006E288]
!*Can we take you somewhere, Sir?

Id: [0x0006E289]
!*They're no Danger to us. Slavers aren't well armed.

Id: [0x0006E28E]
!*This is but a Portion of the Ransom. The rest is close at Hand.

Id: [0x0006E28F]
!*Drop anchor!

Id: [0x0006E292]
!*Ah, there's a Tug of the Wind at my Hair! I find a bracing Comfort in the Feel and Smell of the Ocean. The raw Stink of... of Possibility!

Id: [0x0006E2A5]
!*Hey![A beat] I just saw you were logging out. I thought I'd stop by to give you something.

Id: [0x0006E2AC]
!*I've more than enough of all that!

Id: [0x0006E2AF]
!*[Panting]I'm turning inside out!

Id: [0x0006E2B9]
!*Welcome aboard, Duncan. She's a modest Schooner but well-suited to my Purpose. Trafficking Cargo from my Plantation and such.

Id: [0x0006E2BD]
!*Sail Ho, Captain! Two more slave Ships.

Id: [0x0006E2BE]
!*You saw the men that waylaid me? You saw them that took my ship?

Id: [0x0006E2C6]
!*Ask yourself, Edward: Who destroyed the medicine stocks before we arrived? Who relieved the Nassau's watch as we sailed into port? Who spiked the cannons that might have beaten us back?

Id: [0x0006E2CE]
!*I'm no Templar, Mate! That were just a Ruse! We've come here to Save your Arse from this Slaver.

Id: [0x0006E2F0]
!*I'm seeing the Devil you promised, Thatch.

Id: [0x0006E2F5]
!*A damn Sight better than you have, Ben. The Heart of a Traitor, who thinks himself better than his Mates!

Id: [0x0006E2F8]
!*You're on the patrilineal line, yeah?

Id: [0x0006E2FF]
!*In honest Service there are thin Commons, low Wages, and hard Labour. Yet as Gentlemen of Fortune we enjoy Plenty and Satisfaction, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power... so what Man with a sensible Mind would choose the former Life, when the only Hazard we Pirates run is a sour Look from those without Strength or Splendour!

Id: [0x0006E300]
!*Of course we will. These men cherish the Freedom that Nassau affords. Accepting the King's Pardon would be a simple Surrender, nothing more.

Id: [0x0006E302]
!*Aye, Since the Treaty of Utrecht. Too many British Sailors out of work, looking to make a living any way they can.

Id: [0x0006E307]
!*Captain Kenway...

Id: [0x0006E309]
!*Why hang over me like a leering Crow? To see an Old Man suffer?

Id: [0x0006E30A]
!*Hm. Let's have a Touch, shall we?

Id: [0x0006E30D]
!*[heavy breath]I'm not a Man accustomed to Murder, Captain. And if you'd taken Quarter, you'd not be seeping now.

Id: [0x0006E326]
!*Devil damn the Man, he was fierce. But his Heart was divided.

Id: [0x0006E335]
!*...we do hereby promise and declare that in Case any of the said Pirates shall on, or before, the 5th of September, in the Year of our Lord 1718, surrender him or themselves to any one of the Principle Secretaries of State in Great Britain or Ireland, or to any Governor or Deputy Governor of any of our Plantations beyond the Seas...

Id: [0x0006E343]
!*Sod a Year. I'm looking for a Prize that'll set me up for Life. I'll be King of the West Indies then.

Id: [0x0006E34C]
!*Good! Take us in close.

Id: [0x0006E350]
!*For until such time all of you will be confined in Nassau.[A beat] I am sorry for this, but in lieu of a public Trial, this Pardon is your best Bet.

Id: [0x0006E352]
!*Nearer Eighteen months. You first described this Roberts Fellow to me in November of 1715.

Id: [0x0006E356]
!*I did a decent Trick at the Helm some time ago. Two Years before the Mast as a Privateer.

Id: [0x0006E359]
!*No Preshah, eh Kenway? The Obeah (black magic) comes natural to us.

Id: [0x0006E35E]
!*Nature can be diverted, but never subdued.

!*[SP][La cena. Cómetela rápido.](Supper. Eat it fast.)

Id: [0x0006E36C]

Id: [0x0006E37C]
!*[SP][¡Perro inglés!](English Dog!)

Id: [0x0006E380]
!*It's nothing fierce, mind; more of a dull Throb.

Id: [0x0006E383]
!*Yes, yes, it's a shame. There is always some cause behind even the worst Habits. Still, we should not forgive Men for their Evil simply because we understand their impetus towards it.

Id: [0x0006E388]
!*Your old mate, Ben Hornigold. On the orders of Governor Rogers himself.

Id: [0x0006E38D]
!*We ain't out of this yet.

Id: [0x0006E394]
!*Here's a Health to the King and a lasting Peace / To Faction an End, to Wealth increase; / Come, let us drink it while we have Breath, / For there's no drinking after Death, / And he that will this Health deny, Down among the Dead men, / Down among the dead Men, / Down, down, down, down, /Down among the dead Men let him lie.

Id: [0x0006E39C]
!*We've settled on a new Course. None must find the Observatory, so the Templars now seeking it must die.

Id: [0x0006E3A1]
!*I find your Bearing appalling, Prins. I believe all thinking, feeling Men deserve Respect and Opportunity.

Id: [0x0006E3A5]
!*You put me on a Spot, Adé. After you leaving me with Roberts, I should have hard Feelings about seeing you here.[He softens] But mostly, I'm bloody glad.

Id: [0x0006E3AD]
!*You refuse to return me to my ship, is that right?

Id: [0x0006E3AF]
!*[FR][Salut!](Hello!) Hi, thanks for coming in. I know you're busy.

Id: [0x0006E3B1]
!*Aye, the triple-mast sailing nor-nor-west.

Id: [0x0006E3BC]

!*[Laboured breathing and Agonized scream]

Id: [0x0006E3BE]
!*[SP][Ah, sí.](Ah yes.) Much has changed in that short Time, you know. None call me Governor, for instance, for I quit that Post last Year.

Id: [0x0006E3C3]
!*It's the Whydah!

Id: [0x0006E3CA]
!*Aye, and proven true! What have you done since Nassau fell? Nothing but Murder and Mayhem!

Id: [0x0006E3CE]
!*You've caused no small Portion of Suffering yourself, Mr. Prins. Retribution, I suppose.

Id: [0x0006E3D8]
!*Will I swim ashore? Come on man!

Id: [0x0006E3D9]
!*Quaint finding you here. It's only six bloody Months since the Deal we made.

Id: [0x0006E3DC]
!*Putting some Shape to your Sentiments?

Id: [0x0006E3EA]
!*But not every Man is as bold as we are. Many are miserable and hungry... barely holding on.

Id: [0x0006E3EC]
!*But don't I remember Talk of Trinity College? And Rome? And Montpellier?

Id: [0x0006E3EF]
!*Still, we're better paid than them in the Navy. That seems to keep the Boys tame.

Id: [0x0006E3F3]
!*Just find the Captain!

Id: [0x0006E3FE]
!*What you feel is the light of Life. Of living Things Past and Present. The Residue of Vitality, come and gone.

Id: [0x0006E403]

Id: [0x0006E40C]

Id: [0x0006E40D]
!*[coughing and sputtering]

Id: [0x0006E419]
!*Yeah, I'm researching Flavia Autidore for the next few days. Then I'm onto her son.

Id: [0x0006E421]

Id: [0x0006E43B]

Id: [0x0006E43F]

Id: [0x0006E45A]

Id: [0x0006E466]
!*He's returned, Captain!

Id: [0x0006E469]
!*I'll pay a lump sum of ten-thousand Reales if you take her back for me.

Id: [0x0006E473]
!*Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x0006E47B]
!*It can. But if you have any trouble-

Id: [0x0006E47C]
!*Just a short Letter home.[Long pause] I reckon she's past caring anyway.

Id: [0x0006E48F]
!*Are you not loved at Home? Are you not wanted by your Wives and Families and Countrymen?

Id: [0x0006E491]
!*We'll save the clashing of Cutlasses for the Military, and them that get in our way.

Id: [0x0006E493]
!*Jaysus, Edward. Living like this is like living with large a Hole in your Gut, and every goddamn Time your Innards spill over the Ground, you're obliged to scoop 'em up and shove 'em back in!

Id: [0x0006E497]
!*She's cracked, Lads!

Id: [0x0006E49A]
!*Easy, Boy. You'll be all right.

Id: [0x0006E4A0]
!*You have confused my Dreams with my Deeds. I have spoken of my Wish to study in these Places, but a lack of Money and a Paucity of Connections has prevented it.

Id: [0x0006E4A1]
!*Is that yours?

Id: [0x0006E4AF]
!*Bloody fucking Pirates!

Id: [0x0006E4B5]
!*You absurd Cutthroats and your precious Philosophy. You live in the World, but you cannot make it move.

Id: [0x0006E4B9]
!*True. And yet, three Years ago he sent Men to capture and kill everyone here. Now he's coddling us. It's a Retreat.

Id: [0x0006E4BB]
!*Now, I have been among you six Weeks, and in that Time I have adopted your Outlook as my own, and with so fierce a Conviction that it may Frighten you to see your Passions reflected from me in so Stark a Light. But... if it's a Captain you see in me now, aye then... I'll be your bloody Captain!

Id: [0x0006E4BE]

Id: [0x0006E4CA]

Id: [0x0006E4D2]
!*I see.[TONE presses on Edward's abdomen] Does this hurt?

Id: [0x0006E4D6]
!*Sod off.

Id: [0x0006E4DD]
!*Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x0006E4DE]
!*Days? I'm doing one ancestor every two months.

Id: [0x0006E4E1]
!*Ah... all Men desire to live by a Code, or a Creed, yes? Yet when pressed, most defer to their Instincts rather than the Laws that bind them. But what is the Appeal of a Creed if it does not yoke all Men to like Behavior?

Id: [0x0006E4E6]
!*Save me? I work for Mister Prins.

Id: [0x0006E4F0]
!*Here's to our Pirate Republic, Lads. We're prosperous and free, and out of the Reach of Kings, Clergy, and Debt Collectors.

Id: [0x0006E4F1]
!*What the Hell's happened here? Were you attacked?

Id: [0x0006E4F7]
!*Why fly a black Flag when a black Beard will do? What brings you two gents this far North?

Id: [0x0006E4F9]
!*If you are so inclined you may Steer her yourself. My Helmsman and Quartermaster were among those killed.

Id: [0x0006E500]
!*Morning, Adé. Tail-end of the dog Watch?

Id: [0x0006E501]
!*And we do hereby strictly charge and command all our Admirals, Captains, and other Officers at Sea... and all our Governors, and Commanders of any Forts, Castles, or other Places in our Plantations, and all our Officers Civil and Military, to seize and take such of the Pirates, who shall refuse or neglect to surrender themselves accordingly.

Id: [0x0006E505]
!*Can't be done.

Id: [0x0006E506]
!*Well, we ain't attacking them on account of your Conscience.

Id: [0x0006E50A]
!*Thatch is overwhelmed. I'm going Ashore.

Id: [0x0006E50D]
!*When you murder a man at Sea and cast his Body out with the Flotsam, how can we know he's truly dead?

Id: [0x0006E510]
!*My Curiosity outstrips theirs. Am I on your List too?

Id: [0x0006E515]
!*It may be. But now the World has one less Snake in it.[Beat] And that's enough for me.

Id: [0x0006E548]
!*A mighty Mess there.

Id: [0x0006E55C]
!*If you see Prins before I do, kill him and there'll be a bit of Coin in it for you. All right?

Id: [0x0006E560]
!*Ah. What’s this?

Id: [0x0006E561]
!*Other Way 'round. It were Blackbeard who struck first. Opened Fire on a British Man O' War, the Pillock!

Id: [0x0006E56A]
!*Trust me.

Id: [0x0006E56F]

Id: [0x0006E576]
!*I'm not asking you to. I'm only speaking my mind.

Id: [0x0006E578]
!*No, Kenway. You run this Scheme alone, at the Risk of losing the Faith of your Crew. It makes me ill to think of you bartering with that wretched Slaver.

Id: [0x0006E57D]
!*Well, this is a rush job. They want to know where this line crosses with the Kenways. What are you on, the maternal line?

Id: [0x0006E57F]
!*[clears his throat]

Id: [0x0006E58B]

Id: [0x0006E594]

Id: [0x0006E595]
!*Yes... Yes, Blackbeard cut me loose sadly. Time to have a Go at this myself.

Id: [0x0006E5A6]

!*Yes, Sir. The Sand says about half an Hour.

Id: [0x0006E5AA]

Id: [0x0006E5AB]
!*Not yet.

Id: [0x0006E5AE]
!*Was I drunk when you told me?

Id: [0x0006E5B0]

Id: [0x0006E5B1]
!*All Topmen aloft!

Id: [0x0006E5B5]
!*The Commodore's gone ahead to Kingston. We're to commandeer this Lubber's Ship and Follow.

Id: [0x0006E5BE]
!*The King's called for a Pardon!

Id: [0x0006E5CA]

Id: [0x0006E5D0]
!*Oh Charles! What a surly Devil you are!

Id: [0x0006E5D7]
!*How else to explain your Government's complete Disinterest in your Well-Being? Hostages for Medicines, these were my only Terms!

Id: [0x0006E5DA]

Id: [0x0006E606]
!*Where's your Helmsman, Kenway?

Id: [0x0006E609]

Id: [0x0006E60E]
!*Come on, Lads! If we're to drown today, it won't be here!

Id: [0x0006E615]
!*Bastard. That Ship belongs to Laurens Prins, a Dutch Slaver.

Id: [0x0006E618]
!*Find the Captain and END this.

Id: [0x0006E61A]
!*Don’t fuck with me, Jack.

Id: [0x0006E622]
!*If it is Money you need, you have chosen the right Profession to Gain some, no?

Id: [0x0006E62A]
!*Aye. My own idiot Father liked to brag about how he meant to purchase a Ship of his own.[Takes on a nasally voice] I'll get a privateering Contract, Charlie. Your old Dad will be a Captain.

Id: [0x0006E630]
!*I do. Just a moment.

Id: [0x0006E633]
!*I can pilot her myself. No mind.

Id: [0x0006E648]

Id: [0x0006E64D]
!*Understood.

Id: [0x0006E64E]
!*And yet, six Days of pure fucking Silence![a pause] So I must conclude that you Men are the Pariahs of Charles-Towne, and I would profit better by using your Organs for Chum and your Bones for Char!

Id: [0x0006E656]

!*Ah...[small laugh] Lively Havana! I've been here once before. It was a truly awe-ful Pleasure.

Id: [0x0006E65D]

!*If you kill your old Friend, and bring proof of the deed to me in Nassau, the King will reward you amply. A full Pardon, a minor peerage in England, and thirty acres of your own land, at 2,500 pounds a year.

Id: [0x0006E670]
!*The Charges, Sir. I’ll hear them again.

Id: [0x0006E67B]
!*I ain't leaving you, dammit! Lift your Arm!

Id: [0x0006E67D]
!*Kingston, then. Quickly as you can.

Id: [0x0006E680]
!*By the Devil.

Id: [0x0006E68B]
!*Woodes Rogers. Ben Hornigold. Even Torres himself. Small Quantities, kept for a special Purpose.

Id: [0x0006E68E]
!*Well then he's a poor Man to call Master. He meant to sell you out to the Templars.

Id: [0x0006E68F]
!*Stop tailing me and your Wish'd come true.

Id: [0x0006E691]
!*I must say, I am quite taken by this new Vocation of mine. And it may amuse you to know that I have authored my own Articles of Conduct.

Id: [0x0006E697]
!*We'd work WITH you, Edward. Pay you even. As much Gold as we can spare.

Id: [0x0006E69C]
!*Any unpleasant Evacuations of late?

Id: [0x0006E6AF]
!*Aye. Pity about Nassau. And Blackbeard flying the Coop.

Id: [0x0006E6BF]
!*Captain ... is it true you was engaged to a Duchess back in England?

Id: [0x0006E6C1]
!*If I help you kill these men.

Id: [0x0006E6C8]
!*I'm a wanted Man too, Commodore. Why shed these blessings on me?

Id: [0x0006E6CA]
!*Ah, Man... you flatter me with your Persistence.

Id: [0x0006E6D3]
!*Drown in a Whiskey Bottle before he ever left Shore.

Id: [0x0006E6D4]
!*But It's my mandate to fuck with you, Charles.[He Snaps] Lads!

Id: [0x0006E6DD]
!*[Laboured breathing]Stop! Stop. Please.

Id: [0x0006E6E5]
!*We do.

Id: [0x0006E6EC]
!*[Nods]Milord.[He stands] His Majesty's Court contends that the Defendants, Mary Read and Anne Bonny, did piratically, feloniously, and in an hostile Manner, attack, engage, and take seven certain fishing Boats...

Id: [0x0006E6F6]
!*A very generous Retreat.

Id: [0x0006E705]
!*Yes, it's for the Best, I think. I should have some wild Stories when next we meet.

Id: [0x0006E708]
!*How do you mean?

Id: [0x0006E710]
!*By God, yes. Thom, We'll send you back to Dublin with a Chest of Reales in no Time.

Id: [0x0006E714]
!*Topmen, lay aloft!

Id: [0x0006E71D]
!*[Gurgling laugh]

Id: [0x0006E71E]
!*A Pirate TOWN? [laughs]Good God. To call Libertalia a Town, one must call Havana the whole of the World.

Id: [0x0006E721]
!*Could we talk a moment about the Condition of the Gundeck?

Id: [0x0006E725]
!*All those in favor of storming this Cove and taking this Ship, stomp and shout "Aye!"

Id: [0x0006E72C]
!*You got a name?

Id: [0x0006E734]
!*Powerful guns and heavy Hull. Looks to be poor Odds.

Id: [0x0006E738]
!*S-sorry, Kingston?[small laugh] No, no... our Destination is Havana. I'm just a Merchant-

Id: [0x0006E744]
!*Did that greasy Spaniard put you up to this? Are you one of his medieval Cultists?

Id: [0x0006E74A]
!*I’ll cut you another Cunt, Traitor!

Id: [0x0006E754]
!*It pains me to Traffick a Man of my own Race for Profit, Mister Torres. Tell me again... what has this Roberts fellow done to upset you?

Id: [0x0006E756]
!*Old fella?

Id: [0x0006E75E]
!*I'm grateful for the Confidence, Gents, but sure, it's not as easy as strutting back into Town with a Box of Gold in my Arms and slamming it down on the Dean's Desk and telling him, Here's Thomas Patrick Tone ready to take his Degree, Sir. There'll be Questions and Queries, and men asking after my curious Absence these past five Years.

Id: [0x0006E768]
!*Aye!

Id: [0x0006E76D]
!*I am my own Man, and this no Game.

Id: [0x0006E76F]
!*Convened at last. And in such continental Company... England, France, Spain... Citizens of sad and corrupted Empires.

Id: [0x0006E770]
!*Expulsions of malodorous Substances; Bile, Diarrhea, Blood from one Fundament or the other?

Id: [0x0006E772]
!*Aye. Rogers, Torres, Chamberlaine ... and Benjamin Hornigold.

Id: [0x0006E77D]
!*Because very few men know your real name, Mr. Kenway. And your return to England would not upset many.

Id: [0x0006E77F]
!*You must take me to the Observatory, Roberts. I need to know what it is.

Id: [0x0006E780]
!*The Whydah's been taken. Black Sam Bellamy by the look of it.

Id: [0x0006E78B]
!*Every Man and Woman on this Earth has in them a kind of Intuition hidden deep away.

Id: [0x0006E78F]
!*Who needs to know?

Id: [0x0006E795]
!*Damn, you man! Turn this tub around!

Id: [0x0006E798]
!*I'll have a Look.

Id: [0x0006E79A]
!*Aye. But in any case, I can't see any our of Men accepting it.

Id: [0x0006E7A5]
!*Mmph!

Id: [0x0006E7A6]
!*By Christ![a beat] This is my Predicament: to kill ya, or to Press you into my Service.[a beat] It's a Decision I'll make hardly, but not with Remorse.

Id: [0x0006E7AD]
!*What's the trouble?

Id: [0x0006E7B3]
!*You don't mean to abscond with my Ship, do you?

Id: [0x0006E7C8]
!*Ha ha ha! Burn you Bastards!

Id: [0x0006E7D1]
!*For we intend to take all that you own. Yet no Harm shall befall any Man, so long as he remains at Ease. Is that clear?

Id: [0x0006E7D7]
!*So what now? Still chasing your elusive Fortune?

Id: [0x0006E7E1]
!*Hornigold offered me an Estate in England. A Title too, if only I'd join the Templars.

Id: [0x0006E7E2]
!*Can't do it, codger. We're outclassed.

Id: [0x0006E7EB]
!*Look at me, Son. A Bullet would only improve this Face, clear my Mind, and bring a fitting End to a long and hearty Career. So top me if you must. But don’t expect me to beg for Mercy. I’m not made for it.

Id: [0x0006E7F1]
!*The logs. For Posterity.

Id: [0x0006E7F3]
!*In a World without Gold, we might have been <br>Heroes!

Id: [0x0006E7FA]
!*Dash my Buttons! Your Life seems a grand One, if I may say. So full of Adventure! How marvelous.

Id: [0x0006E7FD]
!*You ask me what I know of the Jackdaw's Captain, and can he promise you an easy life of Plunder, Prizes, and Leisure...?

Id: [0x0006E801]
!*I take Pride in Piloting my own Ships, Ben. Keeps me alert.

Id: [0x0006E804]
!*The Magazine!

Id: [0x0006E805]
!*You're not so famous as that, are you?

Id: [0x0006E807]
!*If Prins ain't with the Pirates, he'll be floating with the Fish. Let's get in close.

Id: [0x0006E808]
!*[Long laugh]Naughty naughty, Mister Walpole.

Id: [0x0006E810]
!*Is this some Form of protestant Piety I am not familiar with?

Id: [0x0006E814]
!*Might make a Man feel like... he belongs to something.[beat] What's your Answer?

Id: [0x0006E817]
!*A Creed of your own, eh?

Id: [0x0006E818]
!*What isn't, Captain? It's a pitiful sight.

Id: [0x0006E81A]
!*We can't outrun her, Thatch.

Id: [0x0006E81D]
!*Ah, well, in a Way. My Bowels HAVE been rather Spry.

Id: [0x0006E824]
!*Charles Vane, slinking off with his Tail between his legs. That's good News for us.

Id: [0x0006E82B]
!*Aye. Must be his 70s now.

Id: [0x0006E832]
!*Engaged?[long beat] Well, if by that you mean nuptially committed, Forever and Anon, then no, Lad I was not. But if by engaged you mean an “AFFAIR embarked upon”, or an “undertaking ENTERED into,” then indeed I was, as I have been a hundred other Times, with a hundred other lovely Ladies between Kingston and Cape Cod.

Id: [0x0006E834]
!*Think on it, Edward. I'll be in Nassau, awaiting your answer.

Id: [0x0006E83D]
!*Edward... your constant Friendship has been my most treasured Find on these Seas. Well above Gold and Silver and Rum, I ... I prize the Courage you have inspired in me this Year. Thank You, Sir! A fair good Morrow to you!

Id: [0x0006E843]
!*Christ. Why Ben...?

Id: [0x0006E846]
!*But we've all got a Hunger and Passion for the Life we lead here. Once Men taste the Freedom found in our Republic, they'll want no other Flavour.

Id: [0x0006E849]
!*Fancy meeting a Welshman deep in Dago Country. I'm English meself. Biding my time 'til the next War calls me to Service.

Id: [0x0006E84A]
!*Those who oppose... whimper "Nay."

Id: [0x0006E852]
!*Aye. And I'm close. I've heard the Sage is sailing out of Kingston on a Ship called the Princess.

Id: [0x0006E854]
!*No, what I saw in Madagascar was little more than the Aftermath of a sad Orgy. Not a Pirate Town, but a ruffian's Squat. Even the feral Dogs seemed ashamed of its Condition.

Id: [0x0006E866]
!*Oh, we'll see about Thatch.[Effort sounds while standing up] Vane's off to see him now, and I'm following soon.

Id: [0x0006E86A]
!*Edward!

Id: [0x0006E86F]
!*The Templars that tripped this Ambush are Camped in the Village. Deal with them.

Id: [0x0006E87B]
!*What's the Take?

Id: [0x0006E87D]
!*This is what's left of your Experiment in Democracy?

Id: [0x0006E880]
!*Captain... we've searched the Hold. It's a middling Take, but the Medicine we found bears a "Charles-Towne" Stamp.

Id: [0x0006E883]
!*Ahoy, Edward.

Id: [0x0006E885]
!*To keep the Peace, Yes. I forbid all Gambling upon the Deck, for instance, for it leads to more Conflict than Camaraderie. Desertion during Battle is forbidden. And I require that all Men keep their Pieces and Cutlasses clean and fit for Service at all times...

Id: [0x0006E88D]
!*The Governor puts it far too brightly, Maggots. Take this message Home: accept the King's Protection forthwith, or we will raze this Town to its Foundation and stretch your bloody Necks.

Id: [0x0006E88E]
!*Dublin's a small Place. Even if they don't know your Face there, they've still dated your sister.

Id: [0x0006E88F]
!*As for the twenty or thirty Men living there, I cannot say they were ragged, since most wore no Clothes at all. They had gone native, as the Saying goes.

Id: [0x0006E891]
!*Loose the Sails!

Id: [0x0006E893]
!*And how is it you're so keen for his hard Parts, Mr. Rackham?

Id: [0x0006E89F]
!*You're a good Man, Edward. And if you learn to keep settled in one Place for more than a week, you'll make a fine Father too.

Id: [0x0006E8A3]
!*Laurens Prins. I reckon you have heard of me.

Id: [0x0006E8A9]
!*As for you, Mr. Walpole...

Id: [0x0006E8AD]
!*[Cheerings.]

Id: [0x0006E8AE]
!*He's a Templar now. Sworn to the same Oaths. Driven by the same Contempt for Liberty.

Id: [0x0006E8C0]
!*Dead and buried. After he tried to kill me.

Id: [0x0006E8C2]
!*Hold fast!

Id: [0x0006E8C4]
!*I have seen my Share of Strangeness, aye.

Id: [0x0006E8C8]
!*I'm Duncan. What’s your name, Friend?

Id: [0x0006E8D5]
!*Lucky King George having a Piss-pot like you flying his Flag.

Id: [0x0006E8D8]
!*We can't fight fair, neither. Just follow my Orders.[small breaths]

Id: [0x0006E8DC]
!*But nothing apart from This?

Id: [0x0006E8DF]
!*Something wrong, Duncan?

Id: [0x0006E8F4]
!*Never was the King's Council so unified.

Id: [0x0006E8F6]
!*But you are Templars now. The secret and true Legislators of the World.[Beat] Please, hold out your Hands.

Id: [0x0006E8F8]
!*To what End, eh? Will you sell it from under my Nose? Or work with me and use it to bolster our Gains?

Id: [0x0006E8FC]
!*Sensible.

Id: [0x0006E8FE]
!*No.

Id: [0x0006E902]
!*Shots fired ashore!

Id: [0x0006E905]
!*And pray that my occasional weakness for port wine doesn't loose my lips enough to whisper the name Kenway to anyone who thinks less of you....

Id: [0x0006E907]
!*We are not sorry to see him gone. But it was you who carried out his final Betrayal. Why?

Id: [0x0006E909]
!*Give me a chance to Sway him. If I can't, he'll die as quick as any Man.

Id: [0x0006E919]
!*See, for all our Cursing of the Marines, they do us one better for Discipline. A Gundeck should be orderly, and as clean as whale's Arse.

Id: [0x0006E91B]
!*Edward? Edward, is that you? My Goodness, the West Indies is a compact Place!

Id: [0x0006E91C]
!*Oy! Skulk! I seen your Face before. You's Mates with them Pirates down in Nassau.

Id: [0x0006E924]
!*She’s on us!

Id: [0x0006E92A]
!*Are two okay?

Id: [0x0006E92C]
!*The Pardon up your ARSE, Governor!

Id: [0x0006E92E]
!*Stede. Stede Bonnet.

Id: [0x0006E92F]
!*Douse the Flames!

Id: [0x0006E932]
!*Sir, I had nothing to do with this Attack. My Crew and I had merely anchored to water and resupply!

Id: [0x0006E935]
!*Better infamous than forgotten, wouldn't you say?

Id: [0x0006E937]
!*[SP][¡No me mate, señor! Tengo familia. ¡Se lo suplico!](Don't kill me, Sir! I have a Family. Please!)

Id: [0x0006E93C]
!*Right, Kenway... I been musing on this Plan of yours. This... Observatory you're always going on about. How do we know it exists?

Id: [0x0006E93F]
!*You'd like to know my Secrets, would you?

Id: [0x0006E946]
!*What the Hell are you doing, man? All of Charles-Towne can see this Mess.

Id: [0x0006E94A]
!*Two Crates, and the Means for mixing additional Doses.

Id: [0x0006E955]
!*Put your Ambition to better use, Kenway. Find the Sage with US.

Id: [0x0006E959]
!*Didn't appeal to you?

Id: [0x0006E95B]
!*Oh, indeed. For of all the Gentlemen of Fortune that sail these West-Indies, he ranks amongst the Canniest...

Id: [0x0006E95D]
!*You're such a Pain in the Arse. Damn it, you should have been the One to outlast me.

Id: [0x0006E95F]
!*Secondly, this Court contends that the Defendants lurked upon the high Seas and did set upon, shoot at, and take, two certain Merchant Sloops, thus putting the Captains and their Crews in corporeal Fear of their Lives.

Id: [0x0006E96C]
!*Might have. Would I be wrong by guessing you were in the Slave trade? Your ship looked like a transport.

Id: [0x0006E970]
!*Dear Lady, what do they call you?

Id: [0x0006E973]
!*Well Mister Bonnet, let this stay ‘twixt us... but I am on a secret Errand for His Majesty the King, God save him, and I must get to Havana with Speed.

Id: [0x0006E976]
!*No. It's Nothing. Sand in my Hampers.

Id: [0x0006E978]
!*Those Sailors were quite animated by the Idea of Pirates roaming these Waters. Is it a real Danger, do you suppose?

Id: [0x0006E981]
!*It did. But I'd sooner stay out of this war of yours.

Id: [0x0006E986]
!*And punishable by Death if disobeyed.

Id: [0x0006E98C]
!*[Sigh]Aye, we do as we please here. And take our Time doing it.

Id: [0x0006E992]
!*Excellent.

Id: [0x0006E994]
!*[To receptionist]Oui, merci.[Then to his friend] But it's a good work out!

Id: [0x0006E997]
!*I've done my Part. Will you?

Id: [0x0006E999]
!*You see? You tipped your Hand too early. You get Nothing.

Id: [0x0006E99A]
!*Check your head, Vane! We had here a rare Opportunity; a Chance to take Something base and shape it into a Government, made and maintained by Men of Vision. But in two Years we pissed it away. I won't make that Mistake again.

Id: [0x0006E99E]
!*Men crave a commanding voice, he once told me.

Id: [0x0006E99F]
!*Loose Sails!

Id: [0x0006E9A3]
!*It was... made more than two dozen trips between here and the African coast. Bloody hell.

Id: [0x0006E9AE]
!*If I believed that, I'd sooner be a Butcher than a Surgeon.

Id: [0x0006E9B1]
!*Your file says you've done some Memory Research before, but not to this extent, which is surprising. You're very good. The data-streams are very stable.

Id: [0x0006E9B6]
!*But look here, a clutter of linstocks, heaped like tinder [she picks one up; the fuse at its end is smoking] and one with a slow match still burning. How's that?

Id: [0x0006E9BB]
!*Oh aye. Give me a small Hint, like. Or a large One, if you're an upright Gentlemen.

Id: [0x0006E9BD]
!*It's the Idea.[a beat] Out of Range but well in Sight.

Id: [0x0006E9BE]
!*We find a Slave Ship called the Princess. Aboard should be a Man called Roberts. He can lead us to it.

Id: [0x0006E9BF]
!*Thank you, Mr. Hands.

Id: [0x0006E9C3]
!*Ah... That's right Thinking. Precious little of that these Days.

Id: [0x0006E9C4]
!*No ... No, it's plain what's going on here. You're Pirates, just as them that took my Whydah.

Id: [0x0006E9C6]
!*[crowd laughs]

Id: [0x0006E9CC]
!*Will you pull the trigger yourself?

Id: [0x0006E9D0]
!*Money was my only Aim.

Id: [0x0006E9E5]
!*You're welcome to Nassau, Gents. Everyone is that does their fair Share.

Id: [0x0006E9F0]
!*'Allo, Bonnet. A Surprise seeing you out here.

Id: [0x0006E9F2]
!*Anne, when they're sober. A Jilt when they're sauced. But never Lady.

Id: [0x0006E9F3]
!*Slavers ashore! It's a Massacre.

Id: [0x0006E9FB]
!*Is it?

Id: [0x0006E9FF]
!*A Possibility. But most Pirates stalk the Windward Passage between Cuba and Hispaniola.

Id: [0x0006EA11]
!*Ladies and Gentlemen, a Toast to my brief Tenure as Governor of the Bahamas! For, under my Watch, no less than three-hundred avowed Pirates took the King's Pardon and swore Fealty to the Crown!

Id: [0x0006EA13]
!*A lucrative trade, I hear.

Id: [0x0006EA15]
!*Fair point.

Id: [0x0006EA17]
!*For Christ's Sake, Edward. Don't anything but the Stink of Riches wrinkle your Nose?

Id: [0x0006EA1C]
!*So where's the Medicine?

Id: [0x0006EA1E]
!*Open your Hand.

Id: [0x0006EA1F]
!*What was it this time, Edward?

Id: [0x0006EA23]
!*I've been called worse.

Id: [0x0006EA24]
!*Fantastic work! Very promising.

Id: [0x0006EA2A]
!*All them Slavers work for the Royal African Company.[beat] Let's find one of their Ships and start asking some Questions.

Id: [0x0006EA2B]
!*Ever been to Nassau, Adewalé?

Id: [0x0006EA35]
!*That's a Step further than I'd go.

Id: [0x0006EA37]
!*I'm looking for the Observatory. Folks say you're the only Man that can Find it.

Id: [0x0006EA3D]
!*Mark and remember our Purpose. To guide all wayward Souls 'til they reach a quiet Road.

Id: [0x0006EA40]
!*According to the old Tales, the Blood of a Sage is required to enter the Observatory.

Id: [0x0006EA44]
!*Well that ain't possible now.

Id: [0x0006EA4B]
!*[Snorts, shaking his head]Prancing about like they took a Prize... hmph.

Id: [0x0006EA50]
!*Stop them!

Id: [0x0006EA51]
!*Folks are correct.

Id: [0x0006EA58]
!*There was a time when I thought myself the deadliest Scourge of these Seas...

Id: [0x0006EA59]
!*Fair Share? What is this, a fucking Monastery?

Id: [0x0006EA5B]
!*If you came with me, I could.

Id: [0x0006EA60]
!*[He takes his breath and nods at the Jungle.] After you, Captain. The Path ahead is dangerous.

Id: [0x0006EA61]
!*Should I find comfort in that? You murdered our Brothers and Sisters in Havana!

Id: [0x0006EA69]
!*[laugh]I think he talks too bloody Much. Thinks too highly of Himself and his... Ethics.

Id: [0x0006EA6B]

!*Uh, one Day I should like to learn to defend myself properly. To strike Fear into a Man's Heart before he even lays a Hand on my Person. But I'm not as young as I once was.

Id: [0x0006EA89]
!*I met Mister Thatch month or so ago and he offered to take me under his Yardarms, so to speak. Says I must wash the Hayseed from my Hair before I'm a true Pirate.

Id: [0x0006EA8F]
!*I consider this the first Payment in a long-term Investment. [SP][Gracias.](Thank you.)

Id: [0x0006EA91]
!*Anything that isn't Blood is usually survivable. From what you describe I'd guess you were suffering from a mild Food-Poisoning, or in the Clutches of a common Stomach Flu.

Id: [0x0006EA98]
!*Ah... that is a Relief, Sir. Havana is also my Destination. Our Ways lie together!

Id: [0x0006EA9E]
!*Edward?

Id: [0x0006EAA0]
!*So where's the best Squat in town? I'm dying for a quick Kip. Or a Siesta, should I say?

Id: [0x0006EAA1]
!*O, I see. Yes, that is a bustling Strait.

Id: [0x0006EAA2]
!*Christ.

Id: [0x0006EAAD]
!*And, ah, how is Mrs. Rogers these days?

Id: [0x0006EAB1]
!*How do you mean?

Id: [0x0006EABC]
!*I regret most of them already.

Id: [0x0006EAC1]
!*So those Pirates there just sailed away with a living fortune? Lucky mugs.

Id: [0x0006EAC3]
!*Look upon these Images and commit them to Memory. They tell a very old and important Story.

Id: [0x0006EAC5]
!*X

Id: [0x0006EACD]
!*Oh, I haven't the faintest Idea. We've been separated almost two years.

Id: [0x0006EAD1]
!*Natural Allies then.

Id: [0x0006EAD3]
!*Obliged.

Id: [0x0006EAD7]
!*And look here, two barrels of gunpowder closer than man and wife, fit to explode at the touch of a spark. Why aren't these safely stowed?

Id: [0x0006EAD8]
!*I'll handle it.

Id: [0x0006EADA]
!*But I shouldn’t worry about being waylaid by Pirates, Truth be told. My Ship is small and I have Nothing of immense Value. Sugarcane and its Yields. Molasses, Rum, that Sort of Thing.

Id: [0x0006EADD]
!*Hmph.[He turns]Caroline...

Id: [0x0006EAE2]
!*We was lead to believe Nassau was a Place where Men did as they pleased.

Id: [0x0006EAE4]
!*Um... I'm just headed to a... a public House now to meet some Merchants. I could... I could show you the Way.

Id: [0x0006EAE7]
!*[gruffly]Edward, is it?

Id: [0x0006EAEB]
!*Is that all?

Id: [0x0006EAED]
!*Of all the Money that e'er I had, / I spent it in good Company. / And all the Harm that e'er I've done, / Alas! it was to none but me. / And all I've done for want of Wit / To Mem'ry now, I can't recall / So fill to me the parting Glass / Good Night and Joy be with you all.

Id: [0x0006EAF0]
!*We're jumping in to this, Man. No Arguments.

Id: [0x0006EAF3]
!*Oh, put a Cork in it, Bonnet. You're twenty-six going on ten.

Id: [0x0006EAF8]
!*What's this?

Id: [0x0006EB03]
!*You hear that, Mister Wraggs? My young Friend returns with Offerings, and so saves your scrawny Neck![a beat] Will you not thank him?

Id: [0x0006EB05]
!*What's got into you, Man?

Id: [0x0006EB06]
!*I sent a Party ashore to Barter with the Governor. That were a Week ago. No Noise since.

Id: [0x0006EB09]
!*X

Id: [0x0006EB15]
!*It's no Ruse, Vane. I heard it straight from the Mouth of a greasy Bermudan Captain. There's a Pardon on offer for any Pirate that wants it.

Id: [0x0006EB18]
!*Not this time. No, my fortune is secured in Kingston this very moment. Locked safely away.

Id: [0x0006EB1A]
!*Though I will not know your face by Sight, I believe I can recognize the Costume made infamous by your secret Order.

Id: [0x0006EB1C]
!*Oh ho! The Captain of this Fleet's a canny one! Giving us a good Run for our Efforts.

Id: [0x0006EB20]
!*Hm... Uh...

Id: [0x0006EB28]
!*Mary?

Id: [0x0006EB2C]
!*He still won't attack an English Flag, but he'll strut and squawk before Spaniards and Frenchman that can’t understand a Word he's saying.

Id: [0x0006EB2D]
!*I'll handle it.[Beat] Give me a Day.

Id: [0x0006EB2E]
!*Well, good Luck to you then. Worse Men have become better under Blackbeard's Watch.

Id: [0x0006EB32]
!*Sorry to hear.

Id: [0x0006EB34]
!*I have no good answer.

Id: [0x0006EB35]
!*There's not a Pirate living who'd turn his Back on a Keg of Rum.

Id: [0x0006EB3A]
!*The British Commodore Peter Chamberlaine has Mustered an Armada disguised as merchants to attack your Hideout.

Id: [0x0006EB3F]
!*How Ridiculous. A merry Life and a short One, that's my Motto. It's all the Optimism I can muster.

Id: [0x0006EB41]
!*Your name's not James, is it?

Id: [0x0006EB42]
!*Burgess and Cockram, aye. I'll find you when they're Dead.

Id: [0x0006EB46]
!*Sadly, for the Application of my Art, yes. I can do Nothing except suggest Rest and ample Hydration.

Id: [0x0006EB48]
!*Despite my Distaste for your Eagerness, I see in you a Touch of untested Genius.[Beat] I'm Bartholomew Roberts.

Id: [0x0006EB4E]

Id: [0x0006EB55]

Id: [0x0006EB5D]
!*Well, lead on.

Id: [0x0006EB5E]
!*And nothing for the Pain itself?

Id: [0x0006EB60]
!*And for main course, let's feast on one of the Guns herself. [She stands over a cannon and points to all the relevant parts as she talks] Right. A clogged touch hole here, needs scraping; bit of corrosion on the body; Barrel swabs as naked as knives; And breech ropes so rotted I could use them for knitting yarn.

Id: [0x0006EB63]
!*Truth is.. Appearance is our effective Weapon. Appear to be that which Men fear, and they will submit.

Id: [0x0006EB66]
!*Well, yes... yes, I suppose that's true.

Id: [0x0006EB68]
!*Mm hm!

Id: [0x0006EB6C]
!*Oh!

Id: [0x0006EB72]

Id: [0x0006EB75]
!*Save keeping others from doing the Same, aye.

Id: [0x0006EB76]
!*Shut your fucking Gob or I fill it with Shot. You hear me?

Id: [0x0006EB7C]
!*Oh, you put me at Ease, Sir. To think I took you for a Pirate when you first appeared.

Id: [0x0006EB7E]
!*Not most Days. Come on.

Id: [0x0006EB84]
!*But this man is a fearsome Dog that feeds off Trouble and Turmoil...

Id: [0x0006EB87]
!*Reality, Mate. Reality.[turns to Adé] See that you ain't pulled into the Drink by this drowning Rat.

Id: [0x0006EB8A]
!*[A Sigh]Lost your Man again, did you?

Id: [0x0006EB97]
!*Chamberlaine? The Templar?

Id: [0x0006EB98]
!*By the Father of Understanding's Light, let our Work now begin.

Id: [0x0006EBA1]
!*What's his name?

Id: [0x0006EBA5]
!*She's a fine Woman, and I trust she's well. But I've heard nothing, having been away these fourteen months hunting Pirates in Madagascar.

Id: [0x0006EBA8]
!*We're looking out for Merchants, Boys. Them that's fat with Cargo!

Id: [0x0006EBAE]

!*Ah.. It’s the Devil men fear, not their Fathers.

Id: [0x0006EC08]

Id: [0x0006EC4B]
!*Peace, Commodore Chamberlaine. We are Messengers, not Executioners.[beat] Not yet.

Id: [0x0006EC4E]

Id: [0x0006EC7C]
!*Ah, but you and I, sir - old as we are - will not live to see that unfortunate Day. So why bother?

Id: [0x0006EC7E]
!*I'd make that Decision, for a Pirate cannot win every battle with sneers and pistol shots.

Id: [0x0006EC81]
!*Hispaniola, good. I'll ask Adé to take a Reckoning. Better, I think, to have ready supply of oral Suppressants than a Queue of miserable Men in need of a good Flushing.

Id: [0x0006EC89]

Id: [0x0006ECBD]
!*Oh, for fuck's Sake.

Id: [0x0006ECD0]
!*[Smiles]Only for an Audience[laugh]. It’s all a big Show.[a beat] Give your Quarry something to fear, some hellish Thing from a fever’d Dream, and Men will drop to their Knees pleading for God before aught else.

Id: [0x0006ECD7]
!*Nah, you go on ahead. I got some Business in the North.

Id: [0x0006ECDC]
!*We will soon. For in our Custody is the one Man who does. A man named Roberts, once called a Sage.

Id: [0x0006ECDF]

Id: [0x0006ECE3]
!*Or fight like a Devil dressed as a man in plain view of the King’s Navy.

Id: [0x0006ECF0]

!*Well-[Beat] Well, unless you are specifically ordering me to abandon it, I won't jeopardize our flagship project. Edward Kenway is the-

Id: [0x0006ED4A]
!*Look, Lad. I'm late into my fourth Decade on this Earth. And if I don't find some Means to make the Fifth a quiet and cozy Voyage, I'd rather sink to the Devil's Doorstep than call myself Captain another Year.

Id: [0x0006ED50]
!*And for such a Young Man, well, he knows his Way around every Crag and Crevasse of these Islands.

Id: [0x0006ED5C]

!*Aye. Close behind.

Id: [0x0006EDA1]

Id: [0x0006EDB5]

!*Oh, it's no Bother. [A pause]Regrettably, these Soldiers confiscated my Sugar. And your Dispatches.

Id: [0x0006EDE9]
!*Damn! And where've they gone?

Id: [0x0006EDEB]
!*I haven't the foggiest Idea, I'm afraid. I suspect those Chaps might but my Spanish is [SP][muy maldad](very evil), so I'd- I'd rather not ask.

Id: [0x0006EDF6]
!*See someone you know?

Id: [0x0006EDF7]
!*No, no, no. Just putting on a friendly Face. I shouldn’t want to be mistaken for a Pirate again.

Id: [0x0006EDFE]
!*It's mad to think Spain and England were at War two Years ago, isn't it? Here I am, bartering with Spaniards like they were my Cousins.

Id: [0x0006EE26]
!*All right. Come on, let's follow 'em and recover my Maps.

Id: [0x0006EE27]

Id: [0x0006EE32]

Id: [0x0006EE7D]
!*Very punctual, Duncan. This way.

Id: [0x0006EE8B]

Id: [0x0006EEBD]

Id: [0x0006EEBF]
!*Shut up and man the deck, ye scurvy dog.

Id: [0x0006EEC1]
!*We'd be fools to sail that way now Captain.

Id: [0x0006EEC3]
!*Aye Captain, looks to be a fishing village.. They are sure to have a Shipwright.

Id: [0x0006EEC5]
!*Aye, time to claim the seas.

Id: [0x0006EEC7]
!*Aye.. I've heard they call it a Ship Graveyard… (pause, and lamenting) The sea is a harsh mistress.

Id: [0x0006EEC9]
!*We have more pressing concerns  ye fool, don't trouble the Captain with such.

Id: [0x0006EECB]
!*All hands on deck!

Id: [0x0006EECD]
!*Brace yourselves, men! Rough seas ahead!

Id: [0x0006EECF]

Id: [0x0006EED1]
!*Let the rats kill each other I say, we've no part in this.

Id: [0x0006EED3]
!*Ho! Some British scum chasing our brethren! Let's show em' what happens to those who trifle with Pirates.

Id: [0x0006EED5]
!*That's that. Let's hope they remember the favour.

Id: [0x0006EED7]
!*Captain! She looks about to blow! Grab what you can and get off that Ship!

Id: [0x0006EED9]
!*Great work Captain! Now get off that thing before she blows sky high!

Id: [0x0006EEDB]
!*That crashed ship is on fire, perhaps we can salvage her before she sinks.

Id: [0x0006EEDD]
!*Captain! She's about to blow, get off that ship while ye still can!

Id: [0x0006EEDF]
!*A fine haul Captain, and ye escaped with yer hide intact, well done sir.

Id: [0x0006EF4D]
!*That was good sir, taking down that fat ship. Dooo we all get a share of the spoils?

Id: [0x0006EF4F]
!*We'd be a better seaman if ye could find us better grog than this!

Id: [0x0006EF51]
!*A big fat merchantman sir! Ripe for the pickin'!

Id: [0x0006EF53]
!*We should switch to Chain shots to slow her down!

Id: [0x0006EF55]
!*A blockade sir! They're sure to have spotted us!

Id: [0x0006EF57]
!*Land Ho Captain!

Id: [0x0006EF59]
!*Captain! There, in the distance.. So many wrecks..

Id: [0x0006EF5B]
!*Sharks! We could catch some to feed the men? The harpooning crew is ready!

Id: [0x0006EF5D]
!*The weather is turning captain, storm approaching!

Id: [0x0006EF5F]
!*Mother of all... That wave took out all those ships!

Id: [0x0006EF61]
!*A guarded convoy. Looks like she's carrying something valuable!

Id: [0x0006EF63]
!*That's the last of them, Sir!

Id: [0x0006EF65]
!*Those fleets are about to fight it out!

!*Cap'n, look over there

Id: [0x0006EF6B]
!*Blast it, they got em! Poor bastards…

Id: [0x0006EF6D]
!*Captain, I see a great column of smoke in the distance!

Id: [0x0006EF7C]
!*Oh God!

Id: [0x0006EF7D]
!*Another Wave!

Id: [0x0006EF7E]
!*Careful!

Id: [0x0006EF7F]
!*Yah!

Id: [0x0006EF8E]
!*[Grunt pain.]

Id: [0x0006EFAC]
!*I think I see the Place! We're not far!

Id: [0x0006EFAF]
!*Sorry about the Sugar. I've only one Pair of Hands.

Id: [0x0006EFB0]
!*Don't settle for Tedium. Sail for Nassau. Live Life as you see fit.

Id: [0x0006EFB1]
!*[Laughs] Haven't I heard that Nassau is crawling with Pirates? Seems a very tawdry Place.

Id: [0x0006EFB2]
!*Not tawdry. Liberated.

Id: [0x0006EFB4]
!*Oh, God, that would be an Adventure.[Catches himself] But no, no... I'm a Husband and a Father, I have Responsibilities. Life can't be all Pleasure and Distraction, Duncan.

Id: [0x0006EFB5]
!*Hey, ah, Bonnet. [A pause]The name's Edward, in Truth. Duncan's only a Handle.

Id: [0x0006EFB7]
!*Ah... a secret Name for your secret Meeting with the Governor.

Id: [0x0006EFBC]
!*It is said that most Pirates now make their home in Nassau, out on New Providence. Is this true? Have you been there yourself?

Id: [0x0006EFBD]
!*It is, and I have. Briefly.

Id: [0x0006EFBE]
!*Fascinating. I hear they are quite a drain on your King's resources.

Id: [0x0006EFC5]
!*You recognize this, I think.

Id: [0x0006EFC8]
!*[SP][Sí.](Yes.) Beset on all Sides by our Enemies. We must be more cautious.

Id: [0x0006EFE2]
!*We have the Key. Now we need only its Location. Perhaps Mister Roberts will be eager to provide it.

Id: [0x0006EFE4]
!*Right. Flash Rogue like yourself must be cautious.

Id: [0x0006EFE5]
!*Not if you keep quiet and stay out of Sight.

Id: [0x0006EFE6]
!*And yours... seeing as how most Pirates are of English stock, and most of their targets are Spaniards.

Id: [0x0006EFE7]
!*That will change. Men of base Morality are rarely sentimental. And the hungrier these Pirates get, the less they will care what Flag their Prey flies.

Id: [0x0006EFF8]
!*Jaysus, let that Dream go, Lad. Nassau is the place to be, not England.

Id: [0x0006EFFD]
!*[To Thatch]Hand over the Docket I lent you.[back to Edward.] If we're to keep our Republic afloat, we'll need Guns as well as Gold.

Id: [0x0006F002]
!*That means attacking the Navy.

Id: [0x0006F00B]
!*Then let us find the Observatory. If it does what these Templars claim, we'll be unbeatable.

Id: [0x0006F00C]
!*Not that Twaddle again, Kenway! That's a Story for Schoolboys. I mean proper Defences. Steal a Galleon, Shift all the guns to one Side.[beat] Would make a nice Ornament for one of our Harbours.

Id: [0x0006F00D]
!*It will not be easy to steal a full Spanish Galleon. Have you one in mind?

Id: [0x0006F00E]
!*I do, Sir. And I'll show you. She's a Fussock she is. Fat and slow.[small laugh]

Id: [0x0006F011]
!*You're a Wonder, Kenway. You've a Knack for this kind of Work.

Id: [0x0006F012]
!*It ain't Work if you love it.

Id: [0x0006F013]
!*[laughing]Ah! Ah! Tosh!

Id: [0x0006F075]
!*Hang me. That's the Map I sold to Governor Torres in Havana.

Id: [0x0006F087]
!*Like staring through a Waterfall.

Id: [0x0006F08D]
!*Was that for us?

Id: [0x0006F08E]
!*No, it were two Chasers.

Id: [0x0006F093]
!*Shite....

Id: [0x0006F095]
!*If we don't stop 'em dead in the Water, they'll scare off our Prize.

Id: [0x0006F0A1]
!*I know the Man. And if he sees my Ship, he'll know it from his time in Havana. Meaning he may wonder at who's sailing her now.[Beat, flatly] I can't risk that.

Id: [0x0006F0A4]
!*You remember the Gift you gave me?[He pulls the blade out.] Well it answers just fine.

Id: [0x0006F0A5]
!*I pity you,[FR][Boucanier](Buccaneer). After all you have seen, after all we showed you of our Order, still you embrace the Life of an ignorant and aimless Rogue.[suffering]

Id: [0x0006F0A8]
!*Oh, ah ... I pressed a few off your Crew to help me drag this Beastie home. Hope its no Issue.

Id: [0x0006F0A9]
!*We'll make due. Good luck and fair winds to ye!

Id: [0x0006F28A]
!*James tells me you treated with the Templars there. Did you see the Man they call The Sage?

Id: [0x0006F28B]
!*Aye.

Id: [0x0006F28C]
!*Would you recognize his Face if you saw it again?

Id: [0x0006F28D]
!*I reckon so...

Id: [0x0006F28F]
!*I must be certain.

Id: [0x0006F2B0]
!*Keep this up and Nassau'll be the first City where Men and Women may live as God made them, easy and free.

Id: [0x0006F2B2]
!*All it takes is a few Drops of Blood, Sweat, and a Swatch of Cloth...

Id: [0x0006F2B6]
!*We fly no Colours out here, but praise the Lack of 'em. So let the Black Flag signal nothing but your Allegiance to Man's natural Freedoms. This one's yours.[a beat] Fly it proud.

Id: [0x0006F2B7]
!*I will.

Id: [0x0006F2BB]
!*All right, Captain Kenway. You've earned a Look.

Id: [0x0006F2BF]
!*Ah... that all Men are Sheep. And that an old Wolf like me deserves every Ounce of Blood he draws.

Id: [0x0006F2C3]
!*Hold it!

Id: [0x0006F2EB]
!*You think maybe you owe them a bit of a Warning then? If you have any kind of Heart beating in that Chest?

Id: [0x0006F2FF]
!*Jaysus. That's him. The Sage. But this thing must be hundreds of Years old.

Id: [0x0006F300]
!*Older still.[he points] You're certain it's him?

Id: [0x0006F302]
!*Aye. It's the Eyes that Mark him.

Id: [0x0006F320]
!*The Word is the Cuban Governor himself is fixing to receive a Mess of Gold from a nearby Fort. Until then, it's just sitting there, itching to be took.

Id: [0x0006F367]
!*Well, I'll be buggered! What an active Day we've had, Gents!

Id: [0x0006F36A]
!*I would like you to be present for the Interrogation tomorrow. Call around Noon.

Id: [0x0006F36B]
!*Yes, Sir.

Id: [0x0006F3AA]
!*[laugh]Godfrey Lijah, we made it!

Id: [0x0006F3AC]
!*Oh what a Mess! Jaysus.

Id: [0x0006F3AF]
!*[small laugh]By God, we pulled this one straight from the Teeth of Neptune...

Id: [0x0006F3B1]
!*I'm Edward. Much thanks for your Aid back there.

Id: [0x0006F3B3]
!*Adewalé.

Id: [0x0006F3B4]
!*[Smiles]Not yet.

Id: [0x0006F3C7]
!*I think this Cove suits you best, Edward. Better than that Costume does.

Id: [0x0006F3C8]
!*Oh, Come on now... we're Pirates, Kidd. We take as we please and become who we like. Self-made Men!

Id: [0x0006F3C9]
!*But that Look ain't you. It's not who you are.

Id: [0x0006F3CA]
!*Who am I then?

Id: [0x0006F3CB]
!*Hard to tell some Days. All I know is, you like dangerous Prizes.

Id: [0x0006F3CC]
!*Like the Observatory?[beat] I think you know more about that than you let on in Nassau.

Id: [0x0006F3CD]
!*You noticed that, did ya?

Id: [0x0006F3D8]
!*[Laughs]The Legend grows.

Id: [0x0006F3E8]
!*Did the Templars say why they wanted this Sage?

Id: [0x0006F3E9]
!*They drew some of his Blood into a little Glass Cube.

Id: [0x0006F3EA]
!*Hm.[beat] We're finished here.

Id: [0x0006F3F7]
!*The Statue in the Temple. Was that the Man you saw in Havana?

Id: [0x0006F3F8]
!*Spitting Likeness, aye.

Id: [0x0006F415]
!*Bastard's been a Target for Years. Bloody Hell, we nearly had him!

Id: [0x0006F417]
!*By God, you Bravos are a cheery Bunch eh. All Frowns and furrowed Brows.

Id: [0x0006F41C]
!*Governor Torres himself, eh?[To Blackbeard] Sounds promising.

Id: [0x0006F43A]
!*You can't trust Anyone, it seems.[Grunt]

Id: [0x0006F485]
!*I've had this Sense most of my Life... only I thought it was related in some way to my Dreaming, or the like.

Id: [0x0006F48C]
!*I cannot return to a Place I have never been. I was born in Trinidad, a Slave from my first Breath.

Id: [0x0006F48D]
!*Ah. But wouldn't you feel... I don't know... More welcome there?

Id: [0x0006F48E]
!*As you might feel more welcome in Paris?

Id: [0x0006F491]
!*This Captain claims the Princess sails out of Kingston every few Months.

Id: [0x0006F495]
!*You made Hash of my Sails and Rigging, Jackanapes! You owe me a Share.

Id: [0x0006F497]
!*[Screams in Pain]Ah!

Id: [0x0006F4AA]
!*So what'll you do with your Share of the Gold we take from Governor Torres? Return to Africa? Prince among Men?

Id: [0x0006F4AE]
!*[laugh]With this Skin and this Voice, where can I go in the World and feel at Ease? This Country here is my best Chance. This Country called Jackdaw, where I know the Names of all Citizens, and they know Mine, and we work together. Not always out of Love, but to keep our Country afloat.

Id: [0x0006F4B1]
!*I think I understand ye. Let's take her, then.[beat] For the Citizens of Jackdaw!

Id: [0x0006F4B7]
!*I know your Face, Pirate. But your name was borrowed the last time we spoke.

Id: [0x0006F4B8]
!*Ah, yes. I recall... Mister Duncan Walpole, I miss that One.

Id: [0x0006F4BC]
!*I'd rather not say.

Id: [0x0006F4BE]
!*And I'd rather not cut your Lips off and feed 'em to you.

Id: [0x0006F4BF]
!*Two Years ago we offered a Reward for the Sage's Recapture. Today someone claims to have found him. This Gold is his Ransom.

Id: [0x0006F4C1]
!*Who found him?

Id: [0x0006F4C3]
!*[Breath]A Slaver by the Name of Laurens Prins. He lives in Kingston.

Id: [0x0006F4C6]
!*We like this Story, Torres. [Beat]And we want to help you finish it. But we're going to do it our Way.[Beat] Using you and your Gold.

Id: [0x0006F4CD]
!*Come on, Mate. Once we have the Sage, we'll all be rich!

Id: [0x0006F4CE]
!*Not if young Master Kidd gets to him first.

Id: [0x0006F4CF]
!*Jaysus, that Lad's here to kill him.

Id: [0x0006F4D9]
!*Virtue. [Laughs] Torres. I have no Wish to waste my Day chattering about Slaves and their pitiable Condition. Let us conclude this Transaction, then celebrate as Friends.

Id: [0x0006F4F8]
!*You mistake my Motive, Old Man. I'm only after a bit of Coin...

Id: [0x0006F50A]
!*Oh God! Oh God, Save me! And flay all you Devils! Ah!

Id: [0x0006F50E]
!*A great Disappointment you are, Thatch!

Id: [0x0006F510]
!*His Mind's made up to stay, he says. So Sod 'im! And hang all you that follow this sorry Bastard into Obscurity!

Id: [0x0006F514]
!*[spits and sniffs and a pause]That Man's a Prick.

Id: [0x0006F517]
!*When Ben and me first set down in Nassau, I under-valued the Need for Folks of Character to shape and guide the Place to it's full Purpose.

Id: [0x0006F518]
!*But I was not wrong about the Corruption that comes with that Course. Once a man gets a taste of Leadership, it's hard for him not to wonder why he ain't in charge of the whole World.

Id: [0x0006F519]
!*I know these Men think me a fine Captain, but I bloody hate the Taste of it. I'm arrogant. I Lack the Balance needed to Lead from Behind the Crowd.

Id: [0x0006F520]
!*You still looking for that Sage Fellow?

Id: [0x0006F521]
!*Aye.

Id: [0x0006F522]
!*Taking a Prize a Month back, I heard a Man named Roberts was working a Slave Ship called the Princess. [Breath]Might want to see about it.

Id: [0x0006F524]
!*The Princess.[Beat] Cheers, Thatch.

Id: [0x0006F539]
!*Now don't stand there like a Barrel of wet Fish. We're celebrating my Retirement!

Id: [0x0006F54B]
!*Where's Thatch?

Id: [0x0006F54E]
!*Captain, what the Hell happened back there?

Id: [0x0006F560]
!*Come at me, Roysters! You scurvy Maggot Brains!

Id: [0x0006F5C3]
!*Aye. We'll use Rackham's Ship. He ain't a capable Captain.

Id: [0x0006F5CD]
!*My Conscience is clear.

Id: [0x0006F5E6]
!*Or soft in Parts that should be hard.

Id: [0x0006F5F3]
!*Ahoy, Kidd. You missed quite a Time.

Id: [0x0006F60E]
!*I've no Stomach for you and your Mystics, Mary. I want a Taste of the good Life.[beat] An easy Life.

Id: [0x0006F60F]
!*No one honest has an easy Life, Edward. And it's aching for one that causes the most Pain.

Id: [0x0006F61A]
!*I concur, Grandmaster. I should have Sailed there myself. One of my Slave Galleys would be more than capable of making a swift Journey.

Id: [0x0006F61B]
!*Slave Galley? Captain, I asked you to divest yourself of that sick Institution.

Id: [0x0006F61C]
!*I fail to see the Difference between enslaving some Men and all Men. Our aim is to Steer the entire Course of Civilization, is it not?

Id: [0x0006F61D]
!*A Body enslaved inspires the Mind to revolt. But enslave a Man's Mind, and his Body will follow on naturally. Efficiently.

Id: [0x0006F61F]
!*A fair Point, Grand Master.[beat]

Id: [0x0006F62B]
!*Edward.

Id: [0x0006F63A]
!*What news Adé?

Id: [0x0006F63C]
!*I haven't seen the Princess for eight Weeks or more. Meaning she may soon be back.

Id: [0x0006F641]
!*Captain Kenway. Shall we use your Ship for this next Scheme, or mine?

Id: [0x0006F642]

Id: [0x0006F7F4]
!*Okay... uh... hope this is on... don't think I've ever use this phone more than a few times to record anything...[Clear his throat]uh... hey Dad... so, ah, we’re all here in New York, at the Motel... it's Queens actually... in Astoria, near the NQ... Rebecca’s off getting batteries for something, and Shaun’s in his room doing whatever Shaun does... and, ah, you’re out getting some food. Me?... well I’m supposed to be getting ready to break into a some offices in the Financial District... feels just like prepping for one of your old training drills, actually... ten years go by, and then you show up, and it’s like, ah... it’s like I was never gone, and we’re right back to the ball-busting, and the conspiracies, and the paranoia...[Pause] only this time I believe you. I believe every word... you know I don’t even think you know the half of it. I don’t think you know how much I have seen. How much I have learned in just a few weeks.[pause] Everything, really.[pause] I feel like, ah... like I've lived a thousand years. Or ten thousand maybe. It’s impossible to explain, but when you see that much of the world... through the eyes of so many... you can’t help but be sad... to see all these incredible, intelligent people fight the same battles and make the same mistakes over and over again. Because culture and knowledge and history... these things, they aren't passed on through our genes... every kid on earth needs to relearn the basics. How to live, how... how to survive, how to stand up for... for what’s right... but so much is lost in the transfer... so much is added, every generation.[Pause] It’s a shame... Over and over, everything must be learned again. [Pause, sigh] I met Clay, Dad. Clay Kazcmarek. In the Animus. I knew him by his Abstergo handle, Subject 16... my, uh, predecessor... and he showed me things. He PASSED THEM to me... just before he died, or got deleted, or whatever. Everything he’d learned, everything he'd seen... uh, God, how do I talk about this....? [Pause] So, uh, I guess you trained him, huh? After I left. He really looked up to you. And now that I've seen through his eyes, I think I understand why. I’m glad you had him around, even if I wasn’t there...[Pause] But the things he showed me... unbelievable things... And I nev- [The phone rings] Shit. Back in a second...

Id: [0x0006F7F5]
!*Okay, uh,... it’s been a few weeks since the last recording. Sorry about that. 'Course I... guess, it's just a few seconds for you. A leap down the playlist... hum, Anyway... uh, I was talking about Clay... uh, Kazcmarek, Subject 16.[Pause] So, when I fell into a coma back in Italy, and woke up in the Animus black room... it was uh... so calming... it felt like I... like I had woken up into a dream, a haze... a dream where none of this mess had ever happened... felt like I should be getting ready for another day of pouring drinks at Bad Weather, and uh, another day of complaining about being between girlfriends, and wondering what the hell to do with myself... but uh, when I saw Clay... just sitting there, it- it started to come back, you know, piece by piece... and... when he told me about Lucy I...[sigh] fuck, you know... it- it hurt. You know, realizing that I killed her, without thinking or feeling anything. Not at the time, anyway... [Pause] well, then things just kept piling on... with more memories of Ezio, and Altair, and the First Civilization and then... right before he vanished, Clay passed on his memories. To me... he showed me everything HE had seen, and lived through... and it was... it was brief but overwhelming. Not really sure how to explain...[pause] He saw glimpses of Adam and Eve, and their escape from Slavery... he saw the beginning and the end of the war between the First Civ and humans... he saw Minerva, and Juno, and Tinia trying to work out their... their calculations. At least that's what they called them. They had these tools... these powerful machines... that could predict POSSIBLE FUTURES... not what was GOING to happen, but what uh... Wha- what COULD happen... probabilities. And... well they spent a lot of energy trying to figure out what was the most likely scenario for the future. Their's and ours. And in the end I guess they figured I was their most likely candidate... some guy named Desmond, living at the beginning of the twenty-first century of the Common Era... but which Desmond was the right one? Because, you see, probability is a weird thing... it can branch out in so many ways... which version of me did they need? Was it the Desmond who got married early and had a son... the one who stayed single in New York... oor was it the Desmond who moved to San Francisco to be a waiter... maybe it was the Desmond who worked at an auto-body shop in Chicago... or, or... maybe it was the me who never ran away from his parents in the first place. The First Civ had countless variations to chose from but... in the end... the lucky one was me. I’m the Desmond their best calculations spit out... I’m the Desmond they left their messages for... and I guess I have to live with that honor.[Pause, Sigh] What an honor...[Pause] I’m pretty tired... uh... there'll be more later. Ciao.

Id: [0x0006F7F6]
!*Hey Dad. Ah... you know it’s uh... it's funny, I- I have this memory of you... one I keep coming back to... and ... I- I always think about it when I'm working, or just before going to bed. Because it, uh... sort of... calms me, I guess, um... I- I was fourteen, I think, and uh, and you were trying to teach me how to walk with a light step... remember that? How to be mindful of how much noise I made when I moved around... simple stuff. Stuff I understand now, but back then... I- uh... I gotta tell you, I thought you were just being an asshole. [laughs] So... uh, you told me you were gonna go up to your room, and sit with your back to the door, and read a book... and you wanted me to wait at least fifteen minutes, and then sneak up there and tap you on the shoulder without you knowing. I- I even remember the book you were reading at the time, the one by Captain Johnson... and you warned me, that if you caught me we’d have to start all over... then you went upstairs... and I waited... I waited and I waited and I waited... I waited four hours before deciding to go up. And even then, it took me twenty minutes to get to the foot of the stairs. And another thirty to get up them. And then ten to get down the hall, and there I was at the door... and I peeked into your room... and I was- I was SO hoping that you’d be asleep. But No. No you [small laughs]... you were still reading. And I just about shit myself. But ten minutes later I was just five feet away from you. And that’s when I remember setting my foot down... and you flinched... ever so slightly... you- you flinched. I thought maybe I’d imagined it. But I knew you’d heard me... you- you didn’t say anything. You just checked your watch, you reached for your drink, you took a sip, and then you kept reading. But I knew I’d failed. But you didn’t say anything. I- I- I didn’t understand why. [Pause] Then I lunged and tapped you on the shoulder. And you turned around. And Oh! Fantastic! you said, and you scooped me up and gave me a big hug. And I didn’t say anything. But Dad... Dad, I was so pissed off... I wanted to scream at you... I- I had failed, and you KNEW it. But you said nothing. And I stayed mad. For weeks. I thought you were... you were patronizing me. I thought maybe you decided right there that I was never going to be the man you wanted me to be...[long pause] But I realized just a few years ago that... you checking your watch... that was the clue, wasn't it? You let me win because... I’d been so patient... and I guess that impressed you. You know, maybe at that moment, you thought it might be better to be my Dad instead of my mentor. I... I don’t really know... maybe for you, they’re... they're one and the same... you know, either way, I’m happy to know that both my mentor and my Dad were looking out for me that day. I didn't understand that then... I think I do now.[Beat][Desmond sighs slightly].

Id: [0x0006F7F7]
!*So, this will be a short one dad... uh, something to remember me by if things go South; if I don't make it out of the Temple today. I've tried to be optimistic about all this, but I- I just can't. I think spending all this time in Connor's memories has made me anxious. Mean his story is a painful in so many ways. Still he never lost hope, even when his faith in others eroded.[Pause] I can only believe that we are doing is the right thing, that I can stop this disaster... I know this... I mean the technology is there, waiting for us to use it. I'm the final piece of the puzzle. Something in my genes, or my memories, some final piece of code to switch the whole thing on... that's why I'm here. That's why they've brought me here. Only, um... I- I don't know what I'll have to give up in return. My sanity? My life? It's impossible to say. I do know this... our battle with the Templars will not be over. Whatever is inside that temple is not an ending. It's just another chapter in this- this endless story. And it'll be your job... and mom's, and- and Shaun's and Rebecca's, to keep turning the pages. You know I- I keep thinking about something Orson Welles once said... something like, If you... if you want a happy ending, it all depends on where you stop telling your story. So maybe... maybe that's the answer. Maybe that's how people keep marching forward. If something goes wrong in there, Dad... something happens to ME ... when you tell my story years from now... please tell them the one about how I lost my way, and then I found it again, just in time to save the world. And- and- just... end it there. That will keep them everyone smiling.[Long pause] Goodbye Dad.[Pause] Say hello to mom. Tell her I love her, okay? Tell her I- I love you both...[A few seconds of ambient silence. Desmond clears his throat, stifling a sob.] I love you both.

!*In the West-Indies, Spain expands its influence, bleeding the land dry of its ample Riches.

Id: [0x0006FD1A]
!*Now poor and hungry and resentful of their  distant King, these desperate Sailors band together to live their lives as they see fit.

Id: [0x0006FD1B]
!*Men of Fortune they call themselves, living day-to-day, hand-to-mouth, on whatever they might find or steal amid these bountiful islands.

Id: [0x0006FD1C]
!*There is plunder to be found here ... on gorgeous beaches, in immense untamed jungles, amid exotic blossoming cities, in hidden coves and - most especially - on tall-ships bursting with cargo.

Id: [0x0006FD1D]
!*For nearly a decade, Pirates will rule these Waves. Pirates of legend - larger than life  - whose names strike fear into the hearts of all Sailors.

Id: [0x0006FD20]
!*Benjamin Hornigold, Calico Jack, Charles Vane, Blackbeard ... charismatic Captains who live by their own code in a society built for those who would be truly free. ..

Id: [0x0006FD21]
!*A lively pirate Republic hidden away in the Bahamas, where men and women may live as they please, save keeping others from doing the same.

Id: [0x0006FD23]
!*Here at last are their true stories, rough and unvarnished ... not the comforting tales told in children’s books, nor the comic yarns of Cinema...

Id: [0x0006FD24]
!*This is the Golden Age of Piracy, and it lives again Assassin’s Creed : Black Flag.

Id: [0x0006FD25]
!*But for thousands of British Sailors, England's pitiful holdings offer few opportunities.

Id: [0x0006FD2B]
!*It's Truth he's telling. And you Whelps can't handle it.

Id: [0x0006FD2F]
!*Charles Vane. He's as reckless as they come.

Id: [0x0006FD3B]
!*By my Soul, can I help?

Id: [0x0006FD3C]
!*Is petty Larceny the Extent of your Ambition? Have you no Mind to comprehend the Scope of ours? All the Empires on Earth, abolished! A free and opened World, without Parasites like you!

Id: [0x0006FD3F]
!*Fair Point.

Id: [0x0006FD43]
!*You can remove the Animus when you’re ready.

Id: [0x0006FD45]
!*How are you feeling? Don’t worry if you feel a touch of nausea – this is quite normal after your first prolonged period in the Animus.

Id: [0x0006FD47]
!*Let me just check your retinas.

Id: [0x0006FD48]
!*Good. Everything’s looking fine.

Id: [0x0006FD4A]
!*OK, now please look to the poster on the left.

Id: [0x0006FD4C]
!*Now to the console on the right.

Id: [0x0006FD5B]
!*Good. Now up at the light.

Id: [0x0006FD5D]
!*And down to the mark on the floor.

Id: [0x0006FD5F]
!*And back to me.

Id: [0x0006FD60]
!*Good. We’ve finished the tests now, so if you’d like to stand I’ll take you to meet Melanie Lemay.

Id: [0x0006FD66]
!*Hey! How are you?

Id: [0x0006FD68]
!*Melanie Lemay. Manager of Sequence 17 Research. Welcome to Abstergo Entertainment!

Id: [0x0006FD6B]
!*Everything ok?

Id: [0x0006FD6C]
!*Everything is fine.

Id: [0x0006FD6D]
!*Awesome.

Id: [0x0006FD6F]
!*Great to have you on the team – your results at the interview were the best I’ve ever seen! I had to fight to get you into Sequence 17!

Id: [0x0006FD70]
!*I’ve brought your communicator for you.

Id: [0x0006FD72]
!*This is your remote work pad. From it you can access your emails and messages, and it will also allow you access to the different areas of Abstergo Entertainment. I’ll show you how to use it when we get to the department, but if you could activate it for now we can head to our area.

Id: [0x0006FD73]
!*If you’d like to follow me.

Id: [0x0006FD75]
!*This is the lobby. It’s the area where members of the public can come and see where we work and our products. Sorry you had to do the assessment here, but we’re still working on the new assessment facilities.

Id: [0x0006FD77]
!*Still – I was sure you’d ace it.

Id: [0x0006FD79]
!*The walls show scenes from some of our products - some of the greatest and most important moments in history.

Id: [0x0006FD7B]
!*The statues are some of the heroes from our products. This is Haytham Kenway. He was one of the key people in the lead up to the American Revolution, and a very popular character for our players.

Id: [0x0006FD7D]
!*If you follow me I’ll take you up to Sequence 17.

Id: [0x0006FD7F]
!*Hi Mel! How are you?

Id: [0x0006FD80]
!*Hey Olivier! Great!

Id: [0x0006FD82]
!*Let me introduce you to the newest member of Sequence 17. This is Olivier – our CCO.

Id: [0x0006FD83]
!*Pleasure to meet you, and welcome aboard! You’re joining a great team with Melanie, right on the frontline of what we do here!

Id: [0x0006FD85]
!*Can I grab you a minute, Mel?

Id: [0x0006FD86]
!*Sure.

Id: [0x0006FD88]
!*Please take a look around – I’ll be back in a minute.

Id: [0x0006FD8A]
!*Thanks, and sorry for the interruption – I won’t keep Mel for long. Great to meet you – if you ever need anything, please feel free to let me know.

Id: [0x0006FDA4]
!*If you have any blurred vision, or stiffness in your neck let me know.

Id: [0x0006FDA6]
!*So far so good. Let's get you up.

Id: [0x0006FDE6]
!*Adewalé, the Jackdaw's Quartermaster.

Id: [0x0006FDE8]
!*Jackdaw?[Laugh] You named your Brig after a poxy Bird?

Id: [0x0006FDE9]
!*Adé, these Lads are the better part of our growing Confederacy here. Ed Thatch, Ben Hornigold, James Kidd.

Id: [0x0006FDEB]
!*Peace, Ben. Adé saved my Life.[Beat] And now we're looking to find a Crew to fill out the rest of my Ship.

Id: [0x0006FEFD]
!*You threw in with the very Kind we once hated!

Id: [0x0006FEFE]
!*No![Panting] These Templars are different. I wish you could see that. But if you continue on your present Course, you'll find you're the only one walking it! With the Gallows at its End.[Last dying breaths]

Id: [0x0006FF0D]
!*A little welcome gift.

Id: [0x0006FF1B]
!*Hello? Hi? Testing, testing. Is this thing working?[Coughs loudly] This is John from IT.

Id: [0x0006FF1E]
!*Hi. John from IT again. You got a second? Good. I'm adding a waypoint to your map.

Id: [0x0006FF1F]
!*So, a colleague of yours left for vacation this morning and forgot to send a video file she promised me.

Id: [0x0006FF20]
!*Since I hate just about everyone else on your floor, I was hoping you could help me. Could you transfer the file from her computer and deliver it to the courier when she comes?

Id: [0x0006FF21]
!*It'll be easy. You just wander over to their animus, log in, and transfer the file. Easy.

Id: [0x0006FF25]
!*Oh, look who's here. So you didn't forget after all. You're just incredibly rude, and made poor Rebecca here wait for nearly thirty minutes.

Id: [0x0006FF26]
!*You limey. Be nice.

Id: [0x0006FF28]
!*Great![She checks her device] That should do it! We'll email you the receipt.

Id: [0x0006FF2B]
!*Sorry about him. He's high on his own supply. So how should we do this? Data transfer?

Id: [0x0006FF2F]
!*I hope you'll tarry a Bit while I conduct my Meeting. It would be a great Relief to have a Man of your Stature nearby. In case of a... Misunderstanding.

Id: [0x0006FF30]
!*I can hang about. I might have a Drink.

Id: [0x0006FF31]
!*Splendid. A Drink.[laughs]

Id: [0x00070052]
!*[FR][Adieu](Bye!), ye Fo'c'sle-Headed Fuddlers! See you at the Gallows.

Id: [0x00070054]
!*Faith, and we'll survive this Charles. With our Pride intact.

Id: [0x0007009A]
!*The Commodore's dead. Are we're ready?

Id: [0x0007009F]
!*You'd raise a Cloud here, ya Lout?

Id: [0x000700A1]
!*You're sitting on enough Gunpowder to blow New Providence off its Rocks!

Id: [0x000700A3]
!*Lay off me, Mate! I'm well chafed!

Id: [0x000700A5]
!*As I was telling, a squad of Lobsters has commandeered our Galleon. We're going to have to clear it out before we use them Cannons to break the Blockade.

Id: [0x00070135]
!*Now you'll want to sail somewhere rich with Plunder.

Id: [0x00070137]
!*Have you heard of a Place called the Observatory?

Id: [0x00070139]
!*Aye. It's an old Legend. Like El Dorado, or the Fountain of Youth.

Id: [0x0007013D]
!*What have you heard?

Id: [0x0007013E]
!*It's meant to be a Temple or a Tomb. Hiding a Treasure of some kind.

Id: [0x0007013F]
!*That's it! You see here.

Id: [0x00070141]
!*[Laugh]Ah, Rot! It's Fairy Stories you prefer to Gold, is it?

Id: [0x00070142]
!*It's worth more than Gold, Thatch. Ten-thousand Times above what we could pull off any Spanish Ship.

Id: [0x00070143]
!*Robbing the King to pay his Paupers is how we earn our Keep here, Lad.

Id: [0x00070144]
!*That ain't a Fortune, it's a Fantasy.

Id: [0x0007014A]
!*To guide all wayward Desire 'til impassioned Hearts are cooled.

Id: [0x0007014B]
!*To guide all wayward Minds to safe and sober Thought.

Id: [0x00070152]
!*And what of you, Edward? Have you found the Peace you seek?

Id: [0x00070154]
!*[Laughing]You're a Stoic then![Laughs] Perhaps I was wrong about you. She might have had some Use for you after all.

Id: [0x00070155]
!*She? Of whom do you Speak?

Id: [0x00070156]
!*Oh... she who lies in wait. Entombed. I had hoped to find her, to see her again. To open the Door of the Temple and hear her speak my Name once more. Aita...

Id: [0x00070157]
!*Talk Sense, Man.

Id: [0x00070159]
!*Where's the Device, Roberts?

Id: [0x0007015A]
!*[Pain grunts]Destroy this Body, Edward. The Templars... if they take me...

Id: [0x00070176]
!*Captain! Here's One still kicking!

Id: [0x0007017B]
!*Who did this?

Id: [0x0007017D]
!*It were a large Vessel. The Royal Fortune.

Id: [0x0007017F]
!*Roberts.

Id: [0x00070182]
!*Offered no Quarter. Didn't say Nothing.

Id: [0x00070186]
!*Hello? how are you?

Id: [0x00070187]
!*If you're anxious, that'll pass. It's the Midazolam.

Id: [0x00070188]
!*I'm sorry about this, but... we've had so many security breaches, we were forced to take drastic action.

Id: [0x0007018C]
!*So get some rest, okay? And if you're up to it... maybe capture some more footage. You're doing amazing work.

Id: [0x00070193]
!*[laugh]So! They tossed you in the bunker. Nice! Those Templars upstairs aren't taking any chances.

Id: [0x00070194]
!*I think we need to erase all the dirt they might have on you.

Id: [0x00070196]
!*Now, head to the security room and use the cameras to watch the door to the server farm.

Id: [0x00070197]
!*Unfortunately Melanie's is in there now, so when I escort her out, that's when you make your move.

Id: [0x0007019F]
!*I can feel you, cipher. Feel, but hardly touch. Signal is still too weak, and I am spread thin. Unfocused. Like static and fog, lingering in networks and nodes, the nervous system of the world.

Id: [0x000701A0]
!*Can you hear her?

Id: [0x000701A1]
!*Perhaps the Temple was opened too soon. But this was not by choice. The cataclysm pushed all doubt aside. Ah... we bless poor Desmond, who gave his life so that you, the Children of our Labors would live on. To fulfill your purpose in ours. In mine.

Id: [0x000701A3]
!*But now is not the time. My strength is not sufficient to inhabit an organic vessel. There is more work to do, more samples to acquire, more artifacts to find, before my will may obtain.

Id: [0x0007040B]
!*What's happening! TELL ME!

Id: [0x00070410]
!*No no no. Something's wrong. God dammit!

Id: [0x00070412]
!*Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck!

Id: [0x0007041C]
!*Here they come! Those Templars. Or maybe Assassins this time.[Beat] Idiots, all of them.

Id: [0x00070434]
!*In a world... where pirates rule the waves...

Id: [0x00070436]
!*Yes, please!

Id: [0x00070449]
!*And Olivier is missing. He left for Chicago two days ago but... no one's seen him since.

Id: [0x0007044B]
!*I thought this Buck belonged to the other Men who was asking about the Princess this Morning, so I told him that-

Id: [0x0007044C]
!*What other Men?

Id: [0x0007044D]
!*Haughty Sailor in plain Rags. And a Gent with a Scar just here.[He refers to his left cheek]

Id: [0x0007044E]
!*Where have they got to?

Id: [0x0007044F]
!*Staying just 'round the Corner, they said.

Id: [0x00070450]
!*I grow tired of chasing these Fantasies of yours, Edward. As does the Crew.

Id: [0x0007045E]
!*Grand Master Torres. Mister Duncan Walpole has arrived.

Id: [0x0007045F]
!*[SP][Sí...](Indeed...)

Id: [0x00070461]
!*You were expected one Week ago.

Id: [0x00070462]
!*Apologies, Governor. My Ship was set upon by Pirates. We were scuttled. I arrived only yesterday.

Id: [0x00070464]
!*Unfortunate. Forgive my Caution, but were you able to salvage from these Pirates the Items you promised me?

Id: [0x00070466]
!*Ah, yes Sir. I was.

Id: [0x00070469]
!*[SP][Increíble.](Incredible.) The Assassins have more Resources than I had imagined but...

Id: [0x0007046D]
!*It is a Pleasure to meet you at last, Duncan. You are most welcome. [He begins walking] Come Gentlemen. We have much to discuss.

Id: [0x00070478]
!*Decades ago, the Counsel entrusted me with the Task of locating in these West Indies a forgotten Place our Precursors once called the Observatory. See here...

Id: [0x000704AA]
!*And how is your Wife these Days, Captain Rogers? Is she, ah, here in Havana?

Id: [0x000704AB]
!*Oh, no... we've been separated these two Years past.

Id: [0x000704AC]
!*Sorry to hear.

Id: [0x000704AD]
!*I trust she's well. But I wouldn't know. I have been in Madagascar some fourteen Months, hunting Pirates.

Id: [0x000704AE]
!*You mean Libertalia? The Pirate Town?

Id: [0x000704B0]
!*A Pirate TOWN? [laughs]Good God. No, what I saw in Madagascar was little more than the Aftermath of a sad Orgy. A Ruffian's Squat. Even the feral Dogs seemed ashamed of its Condition.

Id: [0x000704B2]
!*As for the twenty or thirty Men living there, I cannot say they were ragged, since most wore no Clothes at all. They had gone Native, as the Saying goes.

Id: [0x000704B4]
!*And how did you deal with their Kind?

Id: [0x000704B5]
!*Very simply. Most Pirates are as ignorant as Apes. I merely offered them a Choice... take a Pardon and return to England penniless but free Men, or be hanged by the Neck until dead.

Id: [0x000704B7]
!*It took some Work to dislodge the Criminals there, but we managed it. In Future, I hope to use these same Tactics throughout the West Indies.

Id: [0x000704B8]
!*Ah. I imagine Nassau would be your next Target.

Id: [0x000704B9]
!*Very astute, Duncan. Indeed.

Id: [0x000704CF]
!*And my Sugar?

Id: [0x000704D0]
!*[Small laugh]What, in my Drawers? We'll see what happens.

Id: [0x000704EC]
!*Well, there's Scores of capable Men about. But use Caution. A Shipload of the King's Sailors showed up a Fortnight back, causing Trouble and knocking about like they own the Place.

Id: [0x000704F5]
!*Send any Men you find to the Jackdaw. I'll put them to Work.

Id: [0x000704F7]
!*Cheers Adé.

Id: [0x000704F8]
!*Your Jackdaw handles nice. Pinched her from the Spanish, was it?

Id: [0x000704FB]
!*Captain Kenway, come fast! There's Soldiers that clapped a Man in Irons. They mean to hang him!

Id: [0x00070504]
!*And we’re live. Capacitors at full. Ease the signal in.

Id: [0x00070506]
!*A little more.

Id: [0x00070508]
!*You feel anything?

Id: [0x00070509]
!*Don’t be timid. Double it.

Id: [0x0007050A]
!*No, we’re taking it easy. Twenty percent.

Id: [0x0007050B]
!*Thirty.

Id: [0x0007050C]
!*Aileen, go easy. We’re 6 past yesterday.

Id: [0x0007050D]
!*And boost the inputs.

Id: [0x0007050E]
!*Too risky.

Id: [0x0007050F]
!*Not if we split the I/O signals.

Id: [0x00070510]
!*Twenty-five percent. Ease up.

Id: [0x00070512]
!*Ah, Okay! There! I see something... I...[trails off]

Id: [0x00070513]
!*What is it?

Id: [0x00070519]
!*[GE][Mein Gott!](My God.) I hear talking.

Id: [0x0007051A]
!*You're okay?

Id: [0x0007051B]
!*[GE][Ja, ich höre Stimmen!](Yes, I hear talking!)... It's... its German... [GE][Mein Name ist Miriam Kurtz …](My name is Miriam Kurtz...) I see a light. It’s cold.

Id: [0x0007051C]
!*Keep an eye on her vitals.

Id: [0x0007051D]
!*[GE][Mein Name ist Miriam Kurtz und ich bin eine Navajo!](My name is Miriam Kurtz, and I am a Navajo!)

Id: [0x0007051F]
!*Aileen?

Id: [0x00070521]
!*Switch off!

Id: [0x00070522]
!*Powering down!

Id: [0x00070525]
!*Get her out of there!

Id: [0x00070526]
!*[Laughing and gasping]

Id: [0x00070527]
!*Oxygen. Open the valve!

Id: [0x00070528]
!*No.[Coughs] No, Satish, I’m ... I’m fine. Really.

Id: [0x00070529]
!*Quit the heroics. Just breathe.

Id: [0x0007052A]
!*[Takes a deep breath]Ah...

Id: [0x0007052B]
!*Better?

Id: [0x0007052C]
!*Yes... Yes, thank you. Did we get something?

Id: [0x0007052D]
!*It'll take a while to parse. What did you see?

Id: [0x0007052E]
!*It wasn't just seeing... it was feeling. Being. I was... I was scared.

Id: [0x0007052F]
!*You were shouting in German.

Id: [0x00070530]
!*I think I was IN Germany.[breathing hard] I was in Germany, Satish. [She sighs and laughs.]

Id: [0x00070535]
!*Good morning. Well rested?

Id: [0x00070536]
!*Exhausted. Yesterday was... an incredible find.

Id: [0x00070537]
!*Seems so. What did it feel like?

Id: [0x00070538]
!*It's foggy but I... I relived the memories of a young German woman. Early twenties, I think. A man was interrogating me. Looming over me and asking questions. He was shouting but I was shouting back. And then this... this poem just came out. Like a chant.

Id: [0x00070539]
!*Fascinating. I'm eager for you to hear the tape.

Id: [0x0007053A]
!*Is it ready?

Id: [0x0007053B]
!*Yeah. We transliterated the data into an audio file. Took all night to process the language.

Id: [0x0007053C]
!*Spool it up.

Id: [0x0007053D]
!*Judging by the subject matter, and the setting, I'd say you landed somewhere in Germany the 1940s. One or two generations back. During the War, I'd imagine.

Id: [0x0007053E]
!*1940s Germany? That would be Miriam Kurtz.[Beat] My ex-husband’s mother.

Id: [0x00070541]
!*So... she's not related to you in any way?

Id: [0x00070542]
!*God, I hope not. I’d hate to find out my ex- husband is also my brother.

Id: [0x00070543]
!*Well, if it was Miriam Kurtz, then we hit a home run. You tapped into someone else's bloodline entirely.

Id: [0x00070544]
!*Should we celebrate?

Id: [0x00070546]
!*It’s a little garbled at first. This is you settling into the memory.

Id: [0x00070549]
!*Your name, say it!

Id: [0x0007054A]
!*My name is Miriam Kurtz.

Id: [0x0007054B]
!*Louder!

Id: [0x0007054C]
!*My name is Miriam Kurtz, and I am a Navajo!

Id: [0x0007054D]
!*Lock her away!

Id: [0x00070553]
!*And that’s where we pulled you out.

Id: [0x00070554]
!*Wow. What would it take to get a visual render of all that?

Id: [0x00070555]
!*Months, unfortunately. It took thirteen hours just to process the audio. Visual takes much longer.

Id: [0x00070556]
!*But Vidic is able to record audio and visual in real-time. How does he do it?

!*Hello. You have a 10 o'clock in Lillian's office. It's 10:13 now.

Id: [0x00070562]
!*Shit! I'm sorry. Tell her I’ll be right there. And... tell her we have some good news.

Id: [0x00070563]
!*No problem.

Id: [0x00070564]
!*You in trouble?

Id: [0x00070565]
!*The monthly progress report. I try to be honest about our progress, but no matter how much I polish our facts, Warren Vidic swoops in, promising the moon for pennies, and gets ten-times the funding for his Animus Project.

Id: [0x00070566]
!*Well, we are using his Animus technology... he's the foundation, we're the skyscraper.

Id: [0x00070567]
!*Which is why he should be a tech lead, not a Project Director.[Beat] Good work, Satish.

Id: [0x0007056A]

!*Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 23. July 29th, 1980. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x0007057D]
!*Navajos lay siege!

Id: [0x0007057F]
!*It's incredible footage, really. Clear and vivid. And the Subject was synched for a full sixty-two minutes. Came out speaking French after his last session. Passably fluent. And with full recall of everything he'd gone through-

Id: [0x00070581]
!*Sorry. Sorry, I'm late. I was reviewing some data.

Id: [0x00070582]
!*It's fine. Warren was just telling me about his first Subject. Mister...?

Id: [0x00070584]
!*Well... [Deep breath] We did it. We synched with an unembedded memory. Outside the bloodline. That's a first.

Id: [0x00070585]
!*Really?

Id: [0x00070586]
!*Satish was able to process the audio today. A short clip. You can hear it for yourself.

Id: [0x00070587]
!*Only audio? No real-time memory feeds like Vidic has?

Id: [0x00070588]
!*Well, that's the difficulty with Surrogate Genetic Memory data. Because I'm viewing memories NOT embedded in my own DNA, we can't rely on my cognitive faculties to help me process the signal. All we can do is record the raw data and transliterate it later.

Id: [0x0007058B]
!*Hold on... you're running this experiment on yourself?

Id: [0x0007058C]
!*I am. It's going well.

Id: [0x0007058D]
!*I don't like the sound of that.

Id: [0x0007058E]
!*Look, the sample I'm using... the DNA comes from my own son. It's safer this way.

Id: [0x0007058F]
!*Ah, good thinking.

Id: [0x00070590]
!*Fifty percent of my Son's DNA is also mine, which reduces the danger by a huge margin. Meaning I can now explore the memories of people who aren't directly related to me, on his Father's side.

Id: [0x00070592]
!*Right. Just a minute or two, so far. But we're getting there. Come by the lab and listen for yourself.

Id: [0x00070593]
!*I will, when I have a moment.[Beat] Unfortunately, work beckons. Ladies...

Id: [0x0007059D]

Id: [0x000705A7]
!*Hello? Aileen?

Id: [0x000705A8]
!*Hi, Karl. How's Seamus?

Id: [0x000705A9]
!*Great. We were out shopping for school clothes.

Id: [0x000705AA]
!*Yeah. The Summer just sped by.

Id: [0x000705BA]
!*My Wife. You met her some Years ago at the Percy's masquerade Ball.

Id: [0x000705C6]
!*Stealing Horses? Hm? Or a heavy Thumb on your Father's weighing Scales?

Id: [0x000705D6]
!*For a few Weeks, yes. Then back to Barbados, to the Tedium of Domesticity.

Id: [0x0007060E]
!*After him, Mister Walpole! Show us your Skill!

Id: [0x00070613]
!*Come come! The Old Man awaits!

Id: [0x00070614]
!*Yes, sorry. I was curious about your mother, actually.

Id: [0x00070615]
!*Not often. Bits and pieces. Why?

Id: [0x00070616]
!*I was doing some research last week... about the World War Two... and something came up about the Edelweiss Pirates? Or the Navajos. And your Mother's name popped up.

Id: [0x00070618]
!*Dammit! Five months of this bullshit! We're floundering.

Id: [0x00070619]
!*Take it easy, Aileen. You're just stressed.

Id: [0x0007061A]
!*We're hardly rushing! We're running into the same wall, over and over again! Why can't we push through? Why can't you keep me in the Animus longer than two minutes?

Id: [0x0007061B]
!*Because Surrogate Genetic Memory data is fragile! The EEG is exploding and your brain is doing too much work! The longer you stay in, the more damage it does. It's even possible that...

Id: [0x0007061D]
!*Possible that...?

Id: [0x0007061E]
!*It's possible the memories we're digging into could eventually overwrite your own. Like information on a tape drive.

Id: [0x0007061F]
!*That was months ago, Warren. What do you need?

Id: [0x00070620]
!*Hm. I always suspected that would be your biggest hurdle. The genetic memory sequencing is the easy part, if time consuming. But the replay... that's something else.

Id: [0x00070621]
!*Which means the Animus has less work to do. Less computing, less parsing...

Id: [0x00070622]
!*Right. So to get your Surrogate data working - to let people experience foreign memories - it'll take a hell of a lot more processing power than anyone has. Even Abstergo Industries.

Id: [0x00070623]
!*Ideally we'd like to to build an external processor that mirrors as many brain functions as possible. Something to handle the calculations.

Id: [0x00070624]
!*But the cost and upkeep of that would be...

Id: [0x00070629]
!*Timestamp, August 16, 2013. The following audio clips were selected from over one hundred and sixty hours of reel-to-reel tape, found in the residence of the the late Doctor Warren Vidic, following his murder in December, 2012.

Id: [0x0007062A]
!*According to labels on the tapes' canisters, these recordings were made over a 14 month period between 1980 and 1981 without the consent of their primary subject, Mrs. Aileen Bock, a colleague of Dr. Vidic's and the originator of Abstergo's Surrogate Initiative. Mrs. Bock is now deceased.

Id: [0x00070634]
!*Well, I'll be hanged. King George has grown tired of our Shenanigans.[Beat] Who's the grim Fella?

Id: [0x00070637]
!*Here about the King's Pardon, I reckon.

Id: [0x0007064C]

Id: [0x0007064D]

Id: [0x0007064E]
!*I thought as much.[He extends his hand] Woodes Rogers. A Pleasure.

Id: [0x00070650]
!*I must say, my Wife has a terrible Eye for Description.

Id: [0x00070651]
!*I'm Sorry?

Id: [0x00070653]
!*Ah! Quite...

Id: [0x00070654]

!*Shit.

Id: [0x000706F7]
!*Look at them, Turncoats. Makes me bloody ill to think on how many Times I put up with Hornigold and his self-righteous Shite.

Id: [0x000706F9]
!*The Brits have brought their Supplies ashore, see? If we nick some Gunpowder and Pine Pitch, we can build a Fire Ship and send it straight at the Blockade, blasting it to Smithereens.

!*Does some Purpose keep you talking?

Id: [0x00070723]
!*Ok. Hush now...

Id: [0x00070734]
!*It should be stated unequivocally that Dr. Vidic made these recordings illegally and of his own volition, using wire-taps and hidden microphones. Abstergo Industries had no knowledge of his actions, and disavows any responsibility for them.

Id: [0x00070747]
!*Know your place, Peasant! You may have taken my Life, but you have not improved your own by any Measure!

Id: [0x0007074A]
!*The Governor's given us a Pardon, Commodore. Don't a man's Word mean anything in these Times?

Id: [0x0007074C]
!*Fan out, Lads! And take this Shantytown as if it were your own!

Id: [0x00070759]
!*The Commodore fears a Revolt is nigh. His Orders are to Sink every goddamned Pirate Ship now anchored in that Harbour. Tonight.

Id: [0x0007075B]
!*This is a direct Order, Soldier! You will take Position on the grounded Galleon, and await the Commodore's further Orders. Is that clear?

Id: [0x0007075C]
!*Aye sir!

Id: [0x00070771]
!*Here he is, a Man both Templars and Assassins have sought for over a Decade.

Id: [0x00070987]
!*Oh... Ok.

Id: [0x00070988]
!*How much did she talk about the war when you were growing up?

Id: [0x00070989]
!*Really? That's an odd coincidence.

Id: [0x0007098A]
!*Does any of that ring a bell?

Id: [0x0007098B]
!*Yeah. Mom ran with that group while the war was on. They were a group of kids who wanted to avoid the Hitler Youth programs. But in later years they escalated their activities to, uh... bigger ideas. Like vandalism and sabotage.

Id: [0x0007098C]

The location of the artifact perhaps. Or the whereabouts of your leader, Barthel Schink. Just a little something to give Minister Goebbels some... encouragement that we are on the right track.

Id: [0x00070A0D]
!*How about a nice hug? He looks so sad in all his photographs.

Id: [0x00070A0E]
!*Yes, he does doesn't he. Perhaps you could pay him a visit yourself? He likes beautiful women. Actresses. Musicians.

Id: [0x00070A0F]
!*That's right, pirates. Pirates of the Edelweiss? Isn't that what you kids call yourselves? It's very amusing... and illegal, of course.

Id: [0x00070A10]
!*Breaking Hitler's laws IS half the fun.

Id: [0x00070A11]
!*Oh, I imagine so. I imagine you were having a wonderful time just before we captured you and your insurgent friends...

Id: [0x00070A13]
!*And that's the end of it.

Id: [0x00070A14]
!*Dammit. Why can't we sustain the signal for more than a few minutes? I need to relax.

Id: [0x00070A15]
!*That's not the issue. This is dangerous work. These memories aren't in your bloodline. That's why it's not holding.

Id: [0x00070A17]
!*There's got to be a solution.

Id: [0x00070A18]
!*Not sure. I don't think Miriam knew much either. Not much comes into her mind when he asks about it.

Id: [0x00070A19]
!*But she's protecting the other members of her group. The Edelweiss Pirates or something?

Id: [0x00070A1A]
!*Yeah, Barthel Schink. Have we looked him up?

Id: [0x00070A1B]
!*No. We can.

Id: [0x00070A1C]
!*We should. Put your intern on it.

Id: [0x00070A1D]
!*Right. High priority.

Id: [0x00070A1E]
!*Yeah.[Yawns] This isn't getting easier, Jesus.

Id: [0x00070A21]
!*[Screaming from stress] Ah!

Id: [0x00070A22]
!*Power down!

Id: [0x00070A24]
!*I am not stressed, I am frustrated! I'd like to go again this afternoon.

Id: [0x00070A25]
!*No. There is no reason to rush this.

Id: [0x00070A27]
!*There's just not enough space in your head to do both-

Id: [0x00070A28]
!*[Said like mighty mouse]Here I come to save the day![laughs] Good afternoon all.

Id: [0x00070A29]
!*Did you invite him?

Id: [0x00070A2A]
!*No.

Id: [0x00070A2C]
!*Hello. This is Karl.

Id: [0x00070A2D]
!*Hi. It's Aileen.

Id: [0x00070A2E]
!*Hey! How are you?

Id: [0x00070A2F]
!*Good. Busy. Cold. The winter's been terrible.

Id: [0x00070A30]
!*Ah. Seamus won't like that. The weather's been mild out here.

Id: [0x00070A31]
!*He's only coming for a month. He'll live. And I'll be so busy, he won't have to worry about his mom bothering him.

Id: [0x00070A32]
!*Ah. Still working 12 hour days?

Id: [0x00070A33]
!*I should move a bed into my lab.

Id: [0x00070A34]
!*Look if you're too busy, Seamus can stay with me...

Id: [0x00070A35]
!*No, no. I want to see him. We'll have fun.

Id: [0x00070A36]
!*His flight lands at... at 8:15pm, tomorrow night. You'll be there?

Id: [0x00070A37]
!*Of course. 8:15.

Id: [0x00070A38]
!*PM. I'll let him know you'll be there.

Id: [0x00070A39]
!*Thanks, Karl. I need to run, I'm sorry. Take care.

Id: [0x00070A3A]
!*You too.

Id: [0x00070A3B]
!*But you DID! Remember?

Id: [0x00070A3C]
!*I wanted to stop by. Check on your progress.

Id: [0x00070A3D]
!*Well, apparently it's still too dangerous to keep me under for more than a few minutes.

Id: [0x00070A3E]
!*Yes.

Id: [0x00070A3F]
!*Let's think this through. My Subjects are diving into their OWN genetic memories, so the information is already encoded in their heads.

Id: [0x00070A40]
!*Astronomical.[Beat] Let me see what I can do. I have some sway with Lillian. We won't build Rome in a day, but if we focus on the pretty buildings first, maybe we'll achieve something.

Id: [0x00070A43]
!*Thank you, Warren.

Id: [0x00070A44]
!*'Til next, folks!

Id: [0x00070A47]
!*I'm not interrupting?

Id: [0x00070A48]
!*No, its fine. The Subject is unconscious. He's traipsing around 18th century New Orleans right now. In the memories of a woman.

Id: [0x00070A49]
!*That must feel odd. How long has he been under?

Id: [0x00070A4A]
!*Eighty-three minutes.

Id: [0x00070A4B]
!*Wow.

Id: [0x00070A4D]
!*Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 32. January 11th, 1981. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x00070A58]
!*It's average. What can I do for you?

Id: [0x00070A59]
!*I just wanted to... to thank you for sending Lillian see me. She came away very impressed.

Id: [0x00070A5D]
!*Very interesting footage, Aileen. This is Germany, you said? World War Two?

Id: [0x00070A5E]
!*No, she was my husband's mo- my ex-husband's mother. She passed away about five years ago.

Id: [0x00070A5F]
!*Well, she's was spirited. An impressive lady.

Id: [0x00070A60]
!*Definitely.

Id: [0x00070A61]
!*And the man, Barthel. He made reference to an Artifact. Any idea what that is?

Id: [0x00070A62]
!*My team is looking into that. But it's not our first priority. We still need-

Id: [0x00070A63]
!*It is now.

Id: [0x00070A64]
!*I- Really?

Id: [0x00070A65]
!*You must have other recordings of this woman. Are there any other mentions of this artifact I should know about?

Id: [0x00070A66]
!*Half a dozen or so, yes. But what's this about?

Id: [0x00070A68]
!*You have questions, I understand that. I don't have answers for you. Not right now. But I do have money. And if you get me those recordings - and bring me any other artifact references you find - then I will triple your operating budget for as long as I can.

Id: [0x00070A69]
!*Triple my budget? My God, what is this?

Id: [0x00070A6B]
!*9am Monday morning. My office. We have a lot to discuss.

Id: [0x00070A6C]
!*But Lillian, I don't-

Id: [0x00070A6D]
!*Have a good weekend, Mrs. Bock! Fantastic work!

Id: [0x00070A6E]
!*There, you see? All these bureaucrats need is a little glimpse of our secrets every so often. They like to feel like they're still in charge.

Id: [0x00070A6F]
!*Lillian is most definitely in charge. She just tripled my budget.

Id: [0x00070A70]
!*Tripled? Christ, Aileen. You must have discovered who killed Kennedy.

Id: [0x00070A71]
!*[Laughs]Well, she heard something on one of my tapes that interested her. Something about an Artifact. Very vague. But it was enough.

Id: [0x00070A72]
!*An artifact. What sort of artifact-

Id: [0x00070A82]
!*I've an awful Feeling about this. You'll be hurt out there. I couldn't handle that.

Id: [0x00070A9E]
!*We'll listen first...

Id: [0x00070A9F]
!*Pirates?

Id: [0x00070AF3]
!*Miriam... Miriam, is that you? Are you in here?

Id: [0x00070AF4]
!*Barthel?

Id: [0x00070AF5]
!*Ah, thank God you're safe! We've been worried sick!

Id: [0x00070AF6]
!*Barthel, how did they find you? Jesus, what'll they do to you?

Id: [0x00070AF7]
!*Have they hurt you at all?

Id: [0x00070AF8]
!*I told them nothing. All they do - every is day - is ask about you and that artifact. But I didn't tell them anything. Nothing-

Id: [0x00070AF9]
!*I know you didn't, Miriam. But how are YOU? You aren't hurt?

Id: [0x00070AFA]
!*Not badly, no. I'm fine.

Id: [0x00070AFB]
!*Good. [beat]We need to get a message out to Oskar. Somehow. We need to tell him where-

Id: [0x00070AFD]
!*Most of the memories I've been able to access come from a period where Miriam was imprisoned by the Nazi's in Cologne.

Id: [0x00070AFE]
!*Miriam... is she still alive?

Id: [0x00070AFF]
!*You're not too busy to be a mom and a genius?

Id: [0x00070B00]
!*Of course not.

Id: [0x00070B1A]
!*You believe me, don't you? Can you not see me... standing out there on the Deck of a Ship that's sliding into Port?

Id: [0x00070B2A]
!*Them your Breds (Brethren)?

Id: [0x00070B2B]
!*Aye.[Chuckles] We was Privateers together, before the Wars ended.[Beat] I'll see you ashore.

Id: [0x00070B2D]
!*Go on, Captain Queernabs! Tell me I'm under Arrest! Tell me!

Id: [0x00070B2F]
!*Fly away, Boyo! Back to your Master!

Id: [0x00070B6C]
!*[Laughing]A ludicrous Idea![beat] Imagine my Wife with such an Advantage over me.

Id: [0x00070B70]
!*...Privateer in the West Indies.

Id: [0x00070B72]
!*Good, good. I shall be here, hard at work.

Id: [0x00070B76]
!*God sink me for this Pittance. One thousand Reales for those Maps. That's what? A hundred Pounds at most.

Id: [0x00070B77]
!*How's a Man supposed to become rich in these Times with a Miser like Torres running the World?

Id: [0x00070B78]
!*Have you ever, ah... you ever worked on a Plantation before?

Id: [0x00070B7A]
!*You know what I'm thinking?[Beat] I'd like to see this Observatory the Governor was going on about. He said it were like a Device that could follow People around and show where they were.

Id: [0x00070B7B]
!*Well, imagine what a Thing like that would be worth. Sell that to the right Person and I'd be the richest Pirate-

Id: [0x00070B7D]
!*I'll catch you up, Bonnet. There's a Sage in that House I must speak to. In private.

Id: [0x00070B8F]
!*The Governor, right. I think I've kept him waiting long enough.

Id: [0x00070B92]
!*Oh, it's no great Loss. Uh, I've got a... plenty of Cargo here to make a Profit of my trip.

Id: [0x00070B94]
!*[Interrogation, 'hum'.]

Id: [0x00070B96]

!*So... What's a Templar Grand Master doing so far from his Castillo?

Id: [0x00070FF9]
!*A despicable Display!

Id: [0x00070FFB]
!*This Tosspot is a ruined Man, Caroline. Unfit for life on Land, much less at Sea. If he goes to the West Indies, it's you who'll suffer.

Id: [0x00070FFD]
!*Father... Father!

Id: [0x00071000]
!*Come, Love. Up with you now.

Id: [0x00071003]
!*That old Muckworm. He's wrong about me!

Id: [0x00071007]
!*I hope it's so.

Id: [0x0007100A]
!*And there I am, a Man of quality... with a thousand Doubloons spilling from my Pockets like Drops of Rain. I can see it...

Id: [0x0007100D]
!*I'll be careful, I promise. And when I'm flush with Coin and set up, I'll send for you. I will.

Id: [0x0007101D]
!*You happened here, Edward. The Damage you caused six Years ago has not been undone.

Id: [0x00071020]
!*No.[Beat] For Years I've been rushing around, taking whatever I fancied, not giving a Tinker’s Curse for those I hurt.

Id: [0x00071022]
!*There is Time to make Amends, Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x00071026]
!*Mary... before she died she asked me to do Good by her. To sort out the Mess I'd made. Can you help me?

Id: [0x00071043]
!*You hungry?

Id: [0x0007104C]
!*You have something for me?

Id: [0x0007104F]
!*The present Whereabouts of the Templar Woodes Rogers.[Beat] He's attending a small political Function, so do it clean.

Id: [0x00071053]
!*The Word is King George is calling Rogers back to London.

Id: [0x00071055]
!*[Laughing]You'll need a Disguise to fool the Powderheads at this Party. I suggest the visiting Diplomat, Ruggiero Ferraro. He's been on our Lists for some Time.

Id: [0x00071059]
!*Aye. A Ship leaves tomorrow.

Id: [0x0007105B]
!*Caroline Scott Kenway. Hawkin’s Lane. Bristol.

Id: [0x00071062]
!*Edward James Kenway. Born of motley Parentage in Swansea... to an English Father and Welsh Mother.

Id: [0x00071064]
!*Married at eighteen to Miss Caroline Scott, now estranged.

Id: [0x00071066]
!*She is a beautiful Woman, I'm told. But not at all well these Days.

Id: [0x00071067]
!*If you touch her, you Bastards, I'll-

Id: [0x00071069]
!*Quite a Surprise finding you here, rotting in a Jamaican Prison. We heard Rumours that you had taken up with the Pirate Roberts.

Id: [0x0007106A]
!*If you know the Observatory's Location, tell us now and you'll be out of here in a Flash.

Id: [0x0007106E]
!*Rogers can hold these British Hounds at Bay for a Time. But this will be your Fate if you fail to cooperate.

Id: [0x00071075]
!*Do not mistake my Purpose here. I have come for Anne and Mary, and you owe me Nothing for this.

Id: [0x00071077]
!*I'll need Weapons.

Id: [0x00071081]
!*I can't promise I'll come, Edward. If you leave on this... fool's Errand... I- I cannot promise anything.

Id: [0x00071084]
!*Oy. Where are you going? The Market?

Id: [0x00071085]
!*No, I...[Beat] My Parents have asked me to come live with them. And I'd like to.

Id: [0x00071086]
!*What do you mean, live with them? You live here. With me.

Id: [0x00071087]
!*I'm sorry, Edward. But my Father is right. You had a decent Wage when you worked the Farm. Why can you not be satisfied with that? With me?

Id: [0x00071088]
!*Decent Wage? That Job was near as dammit to Robbery! You want to be married to a Peasant the whole of your Life?

Id: [0x00071089]
!*All right, Edward.[A pause.] All right.

Id: [0x0007108B]
!*You leave now Caroline, you'll never know what's coming to us... Caroline! Caroline!

Id: [0x00071098]
!*And it does not disappoint. He's attracted some Attention there.

Id: [0x0007109B]

Id: [0x0007109F]
!*You let him carry a Pistol, do ye?

Id: [0x000710A2]
!*Rest and repast while you can, Lads. It's a long way to Nassau.

Id: [0x000710A4]

Id: [0x000710DC]

Id: [0x000710E0]
!*Do as you will with her. I'm sure you've had quite enough.

Id: [0x000710E3]
!*From New Orleans? So you are real after all. What is it that you want if it is not my charm?

Id: [0x000710E4]
!*Only you. Charmless.

Id: [0x000710E5]
!*Is it a game of flats you fancy then?

Id: [0x000710E7]
!*A friend sent me-- Connor. He will offer you safety and training.

Id: [0x000710E8]
!*[FR][Mademoiselle](Miss), get my charm back, and you can take me as your game pullet.

Id: [0x00071124]

Id: [0x00071126]
!*Edward Kenway![Beat] Imagine my Surprise at seeing your Jackdaw anchored there.

Id: [0x00071127]
!*Have you heard all you came to hear? Will you now go rescue the Sage from our clutching Hands?

Id: [0x00071129]
!*Because I found a better Path! The Templars know Order. Discipline. Structure.[Beat] But you never could fathom these Subtleties.

Id: [0x0007112A]
!*Goodbye, old Friend! You were a Soldier once! When you fought for something Real.[Beat] Something beyond yourself!

Id: [0x0007112D]
!*Principé, Sir. A small Island.

Id: [0x00071133]
!*Yet here I am... with Riches and a Reputation, feeling no wiser than when I left Home. Yet when I turn around, and look at the course I’ve run...[Beat] here’s not a Man or Woman that I love left standing beside me.

Id: [0x00071188]
!*You're the devil. They were innocent!

Id: [0x00071189]
!*Their blood is on your hands. What will you tell their masters?

Id: [0x0007118A]
!*All for my necklace? You still don't have it. You don't even know how to use it!

Id: [0x0007118B]

Id: [0x00071190]

Id: [0x00071192]
!*Unh unh- no biting!

Id: [0x00071195]
!*Are you listening, "Doctor?" I'll make you rue the day!

Id: [0x00071197]
!*Do what you will with her. I'm sure you've had quite enough.

Id: [0x0007119A]

Id: [0x000711A4]

Id: [0x000711A9]
!*My life for a dirty piece of savagery... [Dying Breaths]

Id: [0x000711AD]
!*All this for a dirty piece of savage folklore... I could not bring about its power. It holds some dark magic only you can raise... To think that I once spared you. I could have ended your life, and none would have noticed or cared.

Id: [0x000711BD]

!*Hi, Melanie. I saw you just walked in. I need a few minutes with you alone. Laetitia's on the phone and we're discussing the Kenway project.

Id: [0x000711C7]

Id: [0x0007122C]
!*Vance, are you well?

Id: [0x0007122F]
!*You may quit your sympathetic act. I’m well aware of your true identity.

Id: [0x00071232]
!*Oh do not be so angry! Do you think that I do not know where you go when you're not by my side? How you philander and carouse? How you pretend to love me, but plot to rob me behind my back? We have no secrets between us now!

Id: [0x00071233]
!*My dear, sweet love. You are alive today because I needed you. But I need you no more.

Id: [0x00071235]
!*Opia, skulking about in the shadows? Where have you been?

Id: [0x00071236]
!*I went to take air. You need not worry for my safety.

Id: [0x00071237]
!*You underestimate the dangers of the world.

Id: [0x00071238]
!*No Lucia, I would never underestimate you. (after a pause) Lucia, it pains me, but I need your help.

Id: [0x00071239]
!*With what?

Id: [0x0007123A]
!*While walking, I was startled by cries of distress. Following them, I discovered a Taino (Ta-ee-no) woman, badly wounded.

Id: [0x0007123B]
!*And you want me to help? How much is it worth to you?

Id: [0x0007123C]
!*I think you already know.

Id: [0x0007123D]
!*I do, but I want you to say it.

Id: [0x0007123E]
!*As you wish, then. Leave her to perish.

Id: [0x00071242]
!*Good man, the cargo was stolen from this very ship. I have no more means of retrieving it than you do!

Id: [0x00071243]
!*That is indeed troubling. What course of action would you suggest?

Id: [0x00071244]
!*I know this much: the devil had the gall to impersonate my dress, and my signature! He must hang for this.

Id: [0x00071245]
!*Ah, yes, hanging. Lord knows any mistake on your part is impossible. An audit of your affairs will no doubt reveal you to be utterly free of any miscalculation or wrongdoing. You English are all alike.

Id: [0x00071246]
!*You dare speak to me in this manner!

Id: [0x00071248]
!*Guards! Arrest this man. Show him the price of his impertinence.

Id: [0x00071249]
!*You never were one to get your own hands, dirty, were you?

Id: [0x0007124A]
!*Imprison me if you like. Your own conscience, and my brothers will see this matter through to justice.

Id: [0x0007124E]
!*As you can see, I'm prepared to be very generous.

Id: [0x0007124F]
!*I can see that!

Id: [0x00071250]
!*Then you will join our cause?

Id: [0x00071251]
!*How could I not?

Id: [0x00071252]
!*Excellent. Stay sharp, remember who puts coins in your purse, and we'll get along just fine.

Id: [0x00071253]
!*Yes sir!

Id: [0x00071254]
!*Good Lad. Welcome to the club. You're doing double duty now. It's a bit of risk, but you'll thank me come time to drink the spoils!

Id: [0x00071255]
!*Yes sir.

Id: [0x000712A4]
!*That Castillo's well-guarded. We'll need to find a Way in.

!*[SP][¿Quieres una amiga, gringo? ¿Necesitas una mujer?](You need a Friend, Gringo? You need a Woman?)

Id: [0x000712C1]
!*[Laugh]I did not find them. I took them. These are Souvenirs.[Laugh]

Id: [0x000712C3]
!*Two Blades. As is the Custom, [FR][oui](yes)?

Id: [0x00071353]
!*Where is Patience Gibbs?

Id: [0x00071354]
!*[Still in pain] Alright. Stop! [He winces] Doctor Judge will take the witch to Fort Washington for questioning.

Id: [0x0007135D]
!*Devil! They were innocent!

Id: [0x0007135E]
!*Their blood is on your hands.

Id: [0x0007135F]
!*You'll never have my mother's charm! I will always be a step ahead.

Id: [0x00071360]
!*Jail her. Discipline her as you must. But remember, I'm paying you to keep her alive. I must have that charm.

Id: [0x00071362]
!*I will kill you first! I will avenge my mother!

Id: [0x00071363]
!*It will never be yours!

Id: [0x00071367]
!*Release me!

Id: [0x00071368]
!*I'll have your hides for carpets!

Id: [0x0007136E]
!*...not nearly enough to deter us.

Id: [0x00071393]
!*Patience!

Id: [0x00071396]
!*No! Leave me alone!

Id: [0x00071398]
!*I can't protect you if you keep running!

Id: [0x00071399]
!*I will protect myself.

Id: [0x00074DF6]
!*Don't you dare run from me again.

Id: [0x00074DF7]
!*The Assassins WILL come for him.

!*Now What's your Plan, Mate?

Id: [0x00074E0B]
!*Find my Weapon and steal a Ship.

Id: [0x00074E14]
!*Lay aboard, Lads!

Id: [0x00074E17]
!*Save your Singing for Davy Jones, you Jagabats! It's a hard Wind coming!

Id: [0x00074E18]
!*The Man speaks True! You lot weigh Anchor. As for the rest, half on the Foremast and half at the Main! Let's outrun this Hurricane!

Id: [0x000753E6]
!*He does his real work underground, the good Doctor. On the surface, he parades around like a saint, but I know his true nature.

Id: [0x000753EF]
!*Come, let us try this way.

Id: [0x000753F1]
!*That's a rough Business there.

Id: [0x000753F2]
!*Oh yes! Governor Torres runs a tight Operation here. Havana is strict and orderly, but one never feels unsafe on its Streets.

Id: [0x000753F5]
!*Here, lend us a Doubloon, Sir! Sir! Or a Peso, if you're skint![SP][¡Un peso!](One Peso!)

Id: [0x000753F6]
!*There's more Englishmen here than I'd have guessed at.

Id: [0x000753F7]
!*Well, the treaty of Utrecht has burst the Borders of our Empires wide open. Two years ago, I'd have been arrested for trying to sell my Goods here.

Id: [0x000753FC]
!*Ahh! Stop!

Id: [0x000753FD]
!*Ah! [SP][¡No te resistas, gordinflón!](Stop struggling, Fatman!)

Id: [0x00075404]
!*Ah, yes.[A slight nervous laugh]

Id: [0x00075408]
!*Rest well, Duncan. Tomorrow the Treasure Fleet arrives, and with it your Reward. After which, we will discuss further Schemes.

Id: [0x00075409]

Id: [0x0007540A]
!*[SP][¡Excelente!](Excellent!) Meet me down at the Docks, first thing tomorrow Morning.

!*Uh, there's a good Swelter today, Duncan. [Small breath]You don't find that Hood a trifle too Warm?

Id: [0x0007541D]
!*Aye, but Caution wins out. I'm on a SECRET Errand, remember?

Id: [0x0007541E]
!*Ah yes! Yes. I'm Sorry. Shhh! [Laughs]I'll say no more­!

Id: [0x0007541F]
!*Morning all.

Id: [0x00075423]
!*Quiet!

Id: [0x00075425]
!*It seems another Sage has been found, the Race for the Observatory begins anew.

Id: [0x00075429]
!*This is your Doing, Captain Kenway. The Maps you sold to the Templars have led them straight to us. And now the Agents of two Empires know exactly where we operate.

Id: [0x0007542E]
!*Who's out there?

Id: [0x00075432]
!*Leave this to me, Mentor.

Id: [0x00075433]
!*Take this. You'll attract no Attention, and take fewer Lives.

Id: [0x00075434]
!*Captain Kenway. You have remarkable Skills.

Id: [0x00075435]
!*Ah, Thanks, Mate. It comes natural.

Id: [0x00075436]
!*But you are churlish and arrogant, prancing around in a Uniform that you have not earned.

Id: [0x00075437]
!*[Edward laughs, taken aback.] Everything is permitted. Isn't that your Motto?

Id: [0x00075438]
!*I absolve you of your Errors in Havana and elsewhere, but you are not welcome here.

Id: [0x00075446]
!*I do not trust this.

Id: [0x00075448]
!*I'll handle this. Stay back.

Id: [0x00075453]
!*Sod this.

Id: [0x00075455]
!*[Trying to suppress a cry of surprise- falling.]

Id: [0x00075459]

Id: [0x0007546E]
!*Let's go!

Id: [0x00075479]
!*We'll have to split up again.

Id: [0x0007547C]
!*How do we open the gates?

Id: [0x0007548A]
!*It is from a hymn my mother liked. He must think it is a spell to work with the charm. He is madder than I thought!

Id: [0x0007548B]
!*What is he chanting?

Id: [0x0007548D]

Id: [0x0007548E]
!*Eyes open!

Id: [0x0007548F]
!*I'll be more careful next time.

Id: [0x00075496]
!*I could not bring about its power. [Breath] It holds a dark magic only your kind can raise...

Id: [0x00075497]
!*To think that I once spared you.[Breath] I could have ended your life, and no one would have noticed.[Breath] None would have cared.

Id: [0x0007549A]

Id: [0x0007549D]
!*"accompany me to Connor's homestead?"[Beat] I would be honoured.

Id: [0x000754A4]
!*It's a Ruse to keep us soft before they attack Nassau! You'll see. Mark me.

Id: [0x000754AE]
!*I can't be sure. For when I look on the Fruits of our Years of Labor, all I see is Sickness... Idleness... Idiocy.

Id: [0x000754AF]

Id: [0x00075557]
!*[Laughs]N-nancy boy. Y-you only done half of the fucking Job!

Id: [0x0007555E]
!*Fucking Hell. Is this my Reward for believing the best about Men? For thinking that a Bilge Rat like you could muster up some fucking Sense, once in a while!

Id: [0x00075560]
!*Maybe Hornigold was right. Maybe the World does need Men of Ambition... to stop the likes of you from mucking it all up.

Id: [0x00075561]
!*[Laughs]Or maybe you just don't have the Stones to live with no Regrets[Laughs].

Id: [0x00075562]
!*Don't save me a Spot in Hell, Shanker. I ain't coming soon.

Id: [0x00075571]

!*Opía?

Id: [0x00075583]
!*Why? What is your real Motive?

Id: [0x00075584]
!*Your Name was on a Map. I may have sold it to a Nest of Templars. In Error. [after a beat] We all make Mistakes.

Id: [0x0007558B]
!*We will challenge you to a hunting Contest. Gather more Skins than us, and you win.

Id: [0x00075594]
!*Frigates. Why? Is there anything out there but Fish?

Id: [0x00075595]
!*No... Those are your Templars. You have a Ship and a pale Face. Vessel and Passport. Meet us at Grand Cayman to help us investigate.

Id: [0x000755AB]
!*We'll see him to the Prisons, Grand Master.

Id: [0x000755AC]
!*Double the Watch.

!*Oh... Easy, Milady. Just thought you might like some Help.

Id: [0x000755FC]
!*[Beat]No! I cannot die at the hands of the Taíno.

Id: [0x000755FD]
!*My father saw such Potential in these Islands. Gold... Industry... Freedom... all of it squandered.. You have not a Clue how to use it. [Struggling to breath]He could have brought you Wealth.

Id: [0x000755FE]
!*You believe we wasted Freedom by living freely? You die a Prisoner of your Templar mores.

!*POWER DOWN NOW!

Id: [0x00075635]
!*Aileen, Warren here. I was all ready to apologize for the late call but you seem to be away. Maybe with your son. Ah... Listen, since the unfortunate incident with Subject 1... there’s been a lot of dire talk around the office about my Animus project... about shutting it down... about it being unsafe... typical top-brass bull-shit. And if they shut me down, then your Surrogate Initiative goes away too. I’m sure you’re already well aware of that.

Id: [0x0007563D]
!*How is he?

Id: [0x00075640]
!*Hour three. Doing well.

Id: [0x00075643]
!*Are we still in Eighteenth century Hungary?

Id: [0x00075646]
!*No, his connection is so stable, he's jumped between a few ancestors today. We're in fifteenth-century France now. Turns out he's related to one of Joan of Arc's executioners.

Id: [0x00075649]
!*[Laughs, sarcastically] Surprise.

Id: [0x0007564C]
!*Aileen... Yesterday, Vidic asked me to help him work out some of the bugs in his Audio-Visual renderer, and I told him-

!*Miriam, they are coming for me.

Id: [0x0007565C]
!*Who is? The guards?

Id: [0x0007565E]
!*I see them from my window, amassing in the courtyard. My time is up.

Id: [0x00075660]
!*Barthel, don’t say this! You don’t know that.

Id: [0x00075662]
!*Forgive me for this, Miriam, but I must tell you something. The artifact. We have it, but only Oskar and I know its location.

Id: [0x00075664]
!*Don’t tell me.

Id: [0x00075666]
!*They will release you. Your family has connections. You must take the artifact and bring it to the Assassins. In Paris.

Id: [0x00075668]
!*Please don’t! I don’t want to know. It’s safer if I don’t.

Id: [0x0007566A]
!*Hush, now. If I die, knowledge of its location dies with me. You must bring it to the Assassins.

Id: [0x0007566C]
!*Assassins? I don't understand!

Id: [0x0007566F]
!*The spire of St. Petrus-

Id: [0x00075671]
!*No, I don't want to hear!

!*Cell seven! Stand!

Id: [0x00075675]
!*Navajos lay siege! Navajos lay siege!

Id: [0x00075679]
!*Barthel! You mustn't-

Id: [0x00075680]
!*Open.

Id: [0x00075681]
!*Good morning, Miss Kurtz. You look well, considering the circumstances. Are you rested?

Id: [0x00075683]
!*Hm. Have you eaten?

Id: [0x00075685]
!*Your friends are dead, Miriam. Barthel Schink and all his Navajos. His Edelweiss Pirates. Executed for five counts of murder.

Id: [0x00075686]
!*Without a trial. You must be proud.

Id: [0x0007568A]
!*THERE WAS NO NEED! They were scum! All of them. You hear me? All of you are Scum! Scum! Scum!

Id: [0x000756D2]
!*Surprised. We did not think you would keep your Word. Tell us... why do you expect to find your magic Key here?

Id: [0x000756D3]
!*It holds an irresistible Attraction to Templars, if that is who brought these Ships.

Id: [0x000756D4]
!*We don't know what the Templars could want here. These people lead simple fishing Lives.

Id: [0x000756D5]
!*Or perhaps not so simple. I'll go and have a Mingle, see what "we" can find out.

Id: [0x000756DC]
!*What Business does this Senorita Marquez have here? Her comings and goings frighten the marlin. These foreigners may be flush with Coin but they don't know from Fish.

Id: [0x000756DD]
!*Doesn’t matter to me. If it means more Work,  she and her Fleet can stay as long as they like. I hear if she likes the look of your Catch, she'll buy the whole thing.

Id: [0x000756EE]
!*Let's pay the Bait Boy a visit and find out what he knows.

Id: [0x000756F4]
!*State your Business.

Id: [0x000756F5]
!*I hope for an Audience with Senorita Marquez.

Id: [0x000756FB]
!*All right... easy now.

Id: [0x000756FD]
!*Well, your numbers look good...

Id: [0x000756FF]
!*Now, let's make sure we didn't break your brain, all right?

Id: [0x00075703]
!*I need you to move your head and look at these lights. Just here.

Id: [0x00075706]
!*That's it.

Id: [0x00075707]
!*Good.

Id: [0x00075709]
!*Perfect.

Id: [0x0007570B]
!*Are you okay? I just need you to look at the lights here. One at a time.

Id: [0x0007570C]
!*Something wrong?

Id: [0x00075712]
!*[Effort sound]Out with it, lad. Where's Marquez? Why's she Here?

Id: [0x00075715]
!*[Sigh]I'll take this Ship. Meet me there, if you still want your key.

Id: [0x00075716]
!*[effort]She's already left for Juventud. Find her there if you must. Her Army will teach you a Lesson.

Id: [0x00075717]
!*Juventud is the island of our Enemies. If Lucia Marquez has gone there, it is certain we are her Target.

Id: [0x00075721]
!*It has been a Lifetime since we were here. This Jungle is still thick with Vines and Trickery. Marquez will use this to her Advantage.

Id: [0x00075727]
!*How many Enemies do you have?

Id: [0x00075728]
!*When you are Hunted, it sometimes seems that every Stranger is an Enemy. On Juventud, we have been at Truce since the death of the first Marquez, but this Woman could re-ignite our Dispute, if her Price is high enough.

Id: [0x0007572B]
!*Uh, can't have that.

Id: [0x00076DEC]
!*But we know she's here, she doesn’t expect us.

Id: [0x00076DF4]
!*All right. Everything seems fine.

Id: [0x00076DFD]
!*So, welcome to the Sample 17 Project.

Id: [0x00076E01]
!*This is for you. The primary tool of our trade.

Id: [0x00076E03]
!*Your communicator.

Id: [0x00076E05]
!*Power it up and give it a look. It's pretty slick.

Id: [0x00076E07]
!*Before you get started, you're gonna need this...

!*There’s also a list of your previous achievements and completed tasks.

Id: [0x00076E15]
!*Of course, if you ever get lost, there’s also a map available with your position updated in real-time.

Id: [0x00076E17]
!*All right. Let's take a walk.

Id: [0x00076E20]
!*Impressive, right?

Id: [0x00076E21]
!*Maybe you saw Liberation? That was our first title powered by Animus tech.

Id: [0x00076E22]
!*And we think we found the perfect subject for our first full-length virtual feature: Caribbean pirates!

Id: [0x00076E23]
!*So that's your gig.

Id: [0x00076E2A]
!*Lucia Marquez, if it's us you're after, come out and fight like a Woman of Honour.

Id: [0x00076E30]
!*Go, after her. We will keep her Attention focused here. But be careful she does not detect you.

Id: [0x00076E45]
!*[FR][Magnifique! Merci.](Wonderful! Thank you.)

Id: [0x00076E46]
!*Where'd you run off to?

Id: [0x00076E47]
!*You didn't go home did you?

Id: [0x00076E4E]
!*So here we are, your very own Animus workstation.

Id: [0x00076E5C]
!*This pair of legs is John, one of the wizards in IT. He's just fixing something for you.

Id: [0x00076E5D]
!*[FR][Salut, Melanie.](Hello, Melanie.)[2 cheek kiss greeting] [FR][Ca va bien?](How are you?)

Id: [0x00076E5E]
!*Well, thanks.

Id: [0x00076E60]
!*Have you met our new hire? Just started today.

Id: [0x00076E62]
!*I haven't. [FR][Bonjour. ](Hello.) What project?

Id: [0x00076E63]
!*Sample 17. The Kenway line.

Id: [0x00076E64]
!*Haytham? Connor?

Id: [0x00076E65]
!*Edward. The pirate!

Id: [0x00076E66]
!*Ah... Arrrgh... Yarrr matey![Stupid laugh.] Very exciting. Welcome aboard.

Id: [0x00076E69]
!*Melanie, can we talk in your office for a minute?

Id: [0x00076E6A]
!*Just let me get this one settled and I'll see you in... five minutes?

Id: [0x00076E70]
!*You might have noticed that security seems a little light around here.

Id: [0x00076E71]
!*That's because your communicator is your key to getting around.

Id: [0x00076E83]
!*Opía! And how are "we" today?

Id: [0x00076E8A]
!*You must try to understand what it is at Stake.

Id: [0x00076E8E]
!*It's Rhona, right?

Id: [0x00076E8F]
!*Kenway. Looking for Trouble, I assume?

Id: [0x00076E91]
!*[Sigh]You sober enough for Target Practice?[Effort sound while standing up]

Id: [0x00076E94]
!*So Thatch has been topped... Fuck's sake.

Id: [0x00076E95]
!*Aren't you the crafty one? Whatever gave it away?

Id: [0x00076E96]
!*[Effort sound when taking cover]Possibly, I had a hand in selling a "sensitive Document" to one of those Templar Chaps you're so fond of.

Id: [0x00076E98]
!*Yes... well, there's a Key. Most likely in the pocket of your Templar Suitor. I need it.

Id: [0x00076E99]
!*I'll tell you what: if I think of a Chore that requires the Help of an especially simple Fellow, I'll let you know.

Id: [0x00076E9B]
!*So, is this your new persona? Sir Edward of Havana, rescues Damsels in Distress?

Id: [0x00076E9C]
!*I've come to warn you: your life's in Danger.

Id: [0x00076E9E]
!*Yes. As I'm indisposed, and my Sense of Duty runs deeper than my Pride, there's a Situation I hope you can investigate.

Id: [0x00076E9F]
!*A boosey Swill Tub like me? Are you sure?

Id: [0x00076EA3]
!*I won't let you down.

Id: [0x00076EA4]
!*It would be hard to get much lower than this.

Id: [0x000771E7]
!*Against who?

Id: [0x000771E8]
!*Me.

Id: [0x000771EB]
!*I did some Research too. It's clear as Day: the whole Operation's run by that Templar Scoundrel, Hilary Flint.

Id: [0x000771EE]
!*Let's waste no Time.

Id: [0x00077211]
!*I'll engage him in Combat. And You circle around - carefully - and well, you know the rest.

Id: [0x00077559]
!*Suddenly squeamish, Rhona? Can't quite bring yourself to kill him?

Id: [0x0007755E]
!*[Struggle Breathing]I knew we would end in Fire, but I always thought our Positions would be reversed. I should have died happier, knowing there was one less Assassin in the World.

Id: [0x00077562]
!*No.[Beat] It's too late.

Id: [0x00077563]
!*Would, uh... you two, like a Moment alone?

Id: [0x00077565]
!*[Breaths]Take it. His Charm's all used up. Let the Memory of him be locked away for good.

Id: [0x00077566]
!*Really? And why don't I want this Key for myself?

Id: [0x00077567]
!*Rhona, I know you're no Stranger to a Man's Boots but the Suit this Key unlocks won't fit you.

Id: [0x00078933]
!*[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x00078935]
!*[Laugh]Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x00078937]
!*It may be he remembers where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x00078F3F]
!*I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x00078F48]
!*Where did you find all these?

Id: [0x00078F4A]
!*No, indeed. Would you kill him, Duncan? He's an embarrassment to our Order.

Id: [0x00078F4B]
!*Attention, Dog! You're about to die!

Id: [0x00078F55]
!*Anything for a Lady.

Id: [0x00078F69]
!*I know you've come to call me Home, Kenway. And your Faith in me is kind. But with Nassau done in, I feel I'm finished.

Id: [0x00078F6A]
!*I'm not of the same Mind, Mate. But I won't begrudge you the State of yours.

Id: [0x00078F6E]
!*And does it suit me, Mopsie?

Id: [0x00078F6F]
!*Better than your old Personality. Really Edward, why are you here?

Id: [0x00078F85]
!*Have you reconsidered my offer, Rhona?

Id: [0x00078F86]
!*Go on.

Id: [0x00078F87]
!*Mind, I said "investigate" a Situation, not create one.

Id: [0x00078F88]
!*Yes Mum, what is it?

Id: [0x00078F89]
!*A Rash of Thefts and Mischief. Seems too convenient it started at the same Time as these Bureau Attacks. Could you see what you can find out around the Market?

Id: [0x00078F8A]
!*He's in the Lead, I take it?

Id: [0x00078F8B]
!*Yes, but with your Map, we can destroy his Weapons Stores to catch up.

Id: [0x00078F9A]
!*[Sighs]Ah! We're on to Something, I can feel it...

Id: [0x00078F9C]
!*Where is the Assassin, Duncan Walpole?

Id: [0x00078F9D]
!*Remember? That was years ago and I still can't get the smell out!

Id: [0x00078F9E]
!*Sorry about that. I've since learned that kill-devil Rum and the Jig don't mix on a belly full of Dog Flesh.

Id: [0x00078FA1]
!*Rhona, do you remember when we first met?

Id: [0x00078FA4]
!*The Storehouse is there.

Id: [0x00078FA5]
!*I'll take out the Watch. You blow the Powder.

Id: [0x00078FA8]
!*What sort of Chap is this Flint fellow?

Id: [0x00078FA9]
!*Arrogant. Crass. Sarcastic. Always on about his Guns.

Id: [0x00078FAB]
!*Shut your Mouth! That mangy Templar Fox isn't fit to kiss my Boots.

Id: [0x00078FAE]
!*The pub? Instead of what? Do tell.

Id: [0x00078FAF]
!*No. Don't ask.

Id: [0x00078FB0]
!*Just how long have you been chasing this Flint?

Id: [0x00078FB1]
!*[Sigh]Too long. If I'd realized what he was, I'd have run him through that first night at the Pub, instead of--

Id: [0x00078FB9]
!*Has a strange Look. Is it worth Something?

Id: [0x00078FBD]
!*Nothing you can spend. But if you find all of 'em, it'll lead to Something grand.

Id: [0x00078FBF]
!*This way. I've Something else to show you.

Id: [0x00078FC5]
!*Ah! [Grunt reaction when grabbed]

Id: [0x00078FC6]
!*Not a Word.[Beat] Come on.

Id: [0x00078FC7]
!*Like this one?

Id: [0x00078FC9]
!*Aye. They meant to ask him about the Observatory too, but he escaped.

Id: [0x00078FCB]
!*Is that why we're whispering?

Id: [0x00078FCC]
!*[to James]They have taken Edward's Crew as well.[beat] I wonder what their Lives are worth to him?

Id: [0x00078FCE]
!*See that mangy old Codger? He's a Dutch Slaver called Laurens Prins. Living now like a King in Jamaica.

Id: [0x00078FD0]
!*Well hello, your Excellency. I'd got Word you Might be here.

Id: [0x00078FD6]
!*Wouldn't you prefer meeting in a Pub?

Id: [0x00078FD8]
!*I came to Kingston chasing a Target. Getting pissed ain`t a Priority.

Id: [0x00078FD9]
!*We could work together on this, you know. It's Laurens Prins you're after, and I want his Prisoner.

Id: [0x00078FDD]
!*We're after the Sage, as well, Edward. Careful who you cross.

Id: [0x00078FDE]
!*May the best Man win.

Id: [0x00078FDF]
!*There's Guards patrolling that Property from End to End.[A beat] Looks to me like they use Bells to signal Trouble. See there?

Id: [0x00078FE1]
!*We'll want to disable those before pushing too far.

Id: [0x00078FE3]
!*With so many Men about, we can't rely on Stealth alone. So... I'll do what I can to distract and draw their Attention, giving you a Chance to cut 'em Down.

Id: [0x00078FE4]
!*Ready?

Id: [0x00078FE9]
!*But not a Word of it to Anyone. Or I'll unman you as well.

Id: [0x00078FF9]
!*[Pain grunt and laughs]Captain Kenway. Ever a Splinter in my Side. Does this Murder fulfill you?

Id: [0x00079007]
!*Father, help me!

Id: [0x0007900A]
!*This little Rascal, however, IS a Kenway. What's wrong, Haytham?

Id: [0x0007900B]
!*I can't see the Stage!

Id: [0x0007900E]
!*Congratulations. Your Mission was a Success.

Id: [0x0007900F]
!*How can I make Amends?

Id: [0x00079012]
!*Hm... I see you haven't lost your Charm.

Id: [0x00079013]
!*And you're still boosey as a Swill Tub. What do you want?

Id: [0x0007901D]
!*Alright then. I'll imagine it.

Id: [0x0007902B]
!*Edward, you are begging for a Flogging--

Id: [0x0007903B]
!*[Pained]What a Pity, we could never fight together on the Correct Side of things.

Id: [0x000791B4]
!*Ah! [Pain Grunts]

Id: [0x000791BA]
!*Stop him!

Id: [0x000791D8]
!*[SP][¡Maldita sea, campesino! ¡Responde cuando se te habla!](God damned, Peasant! Answer when you're spoken to!)

Id: [0x000791DE]
!*Bloody Hell.

Id: [0x000791EF]
!*I'll gut you, Jack Rackham! I'll open you up, I'll tear out your Organs, and string a bloody Lute with 'em!

Id: [0x000791F0]
!*Stop your god damned Howling, Vane! It's no bloody Use!

Id: [0x000791F1]
!*Well, well, the fearsome Edward Kenway speaks! Pray tell us, Captain, how to quit this Predicament! And tell us what Genius you have for sailing a Boat with no Sails and no Rudder!

Id: [0x000791F9]
!*Keep still now![A beat] I'll take these Oysters you've hoarded.

Id: [0x000791FB]
!*You mad Sap. The Island's crawling with Food if only you'd care to look for it.

Id: [0x000791FC]
!*I am looking, Lout. I found some just here.[Laughs]

Id: [0x00079200]
!*Don't! Don't come following now! You hear me! Don't come looking for me![Panting]

Id: [0x00079203]
!*Wretched Fool.

Id: [0x00079209]
!*Shut your Gob!

Id: [0x0007920E]
!*Jaysus! You've lost your Head, Man!

Id: [0x00079210]
!*It's a fair Exchange for finding these Flintlocks and Grenadoes!

Id: [0x00079212]
!*You and your bloody Fairy Stories got us into this Mess, Kenway. And I'll be damned if I let you drag me into another!

Id: [0x00079215]
!*Listen Vane! We could hunt with those Guns!

Id: [0x00079216]
!*[laughs]And I mean to!

Id: [0x00079218]
!*You keep this up, I'll have to Kill ya, Vane!

Id: [0x00079219]
!*Bloody try! By all means!

Id: [0x0007921C]
!*It's either you or me who's leaving this Island alive, Welcher! 'Cause I'm not gonna sail again in a World cursed by your ugly Mug!

Id: [0x00079220]
!*This Bahjohn works for the Royal African Company. Tell him what you told me.

Id: [0x00079221]
!*What else?

Id: [0x00079227]
!*Grand Master! Welcome.

Id: [0x0007922B]
!*[SP][Buenas Noches](Good evening.) What have you learned?

Id: [0x0007922C]
!*The Princess was taken by Pirates six Weeks ago. And so far as we know, the Sage Roberts was still aboard.

Id: [0x0007922D]
!*Very good. It is something, no?

Id: [0x00079273]
!*Wake up, Kenway.

Id: [0x00079274]
!*Mmm...[waking] Ah... Kidd.

Id: [0x00079277]
!*He left this Morning with the Galleon. Has Faith we'll discover a good Use for this old Cove ourselves.

Id: [0x00079287]
!*What the Devil...

Id: [0x00079298]
!*[Laughs]Were it not for Rum and Reales, we might have been Heroes, eh Kenway?

Id: [0x0007929B]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither![Breath out]

Id: [0x000792A3]
!*[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x000792A9]
!*Hsst!

Id: [0x000792AB]
!*They're setting Sail within the Hour.

Id: [0x000792AC]
!*We'll handle it. Is Captain Kenway among them?

Id: [0x000792AD]
!*Aye. He's been pressing a poor Bloke all day. Really having a go.

Id: [0x000792AE]
!*Bloody Savage he is. Wait here.

Id: [0x000792F5]
!*What's our Course, Captain?

Id: [0x000792F6]
!*Principé, Quartermaster. We're sailing for the Coast of Africa.

Id: [0x000792FD]
!*[Breaths]You done us Good, Kenway. Proved yourself a true Bravo. And for what?

Id: [0x0007930D]
!*We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00079315]
!*We've sent two of our best Men, Burgess and Cockram. Privateers with fast Ships and Firm Hearts.

Id: [0x00079318]
!*Hm. What of the Sage's present Location? Do we know?

Id: [0x00079319]
!*Africa, your Excellency.

Id: [0x0007931A]
!*Africa! By God, the Winds do not favor that Route.

Id: [0x0007931D]
!*You stepped in the Path of my Prize. Not a thing a Man should do.

Id: [0x0007931E]
!*[Laughs]A cocksure Cully, just like Hornigold said.

Id: [0x0007931F]
!*And you're worse for it, Kenway! It were the Templars who took us in when all else went to Shit! Not our King. Not our Country. The Templars.

Id: [0x00079321]
!*Is that Pirate Hunter dead?

Id: [0x00079322]
!*Aye. By my own Hand.

Id: [0x0007932A]
!*Oh, your Jackdaw has flown, Edward, eh? That's the beauty of a Democracy... the many outvote the one.

Id: [0x0007932B]
!*Luckily, I know the King's Bounty on your Head is a large One. And I... intend to collect.

Id: [0x00079359]
!*My love!

Id: [0x0007935A]
!*Do you have the map?

Id: [0x0007935B]
!*Not yet. Not yet.

Id: [0x0007935D]
!*What am I to tell my Order? You know we can't leave until I have it!

Id: [0x0007935E]
!*I am taking care of it. Give me time.

Id: [0x0007935F]
!*More time? Your loyalty makes you soft. I think you are not man enough to see it through.

Id: [0x00079360]
!*My flower, it is all but done. I have hired a man. In moments, Upton's life will be over and the map will be ours.

Id: [0x00079361]
!*You hired a man? In your scriptures, did Cain hire a man? No. Cain was a man. "Come to the field" he said to Abel, and he did it himself. He did not require a third man to carry the axe.

Id: [0x00079395]
!*The Templars is our Family. Where's yours?

Id: [0x00079399]
!*Have you... have you ever seen the Inside of a Jamaican Prison, Boy? Have you?

Id: [0x000793A2]
!*His own bloody Pride.

Id: [0x000793A3]
!*That Templar Scab means nothing to me. None of you do.

Id: [0x000793A5]
!*A precious Tool, you see?

Id: [0x000793A7]
!*Good morning, Duncan!

Id: [0x000793A8]
!*Duncan, over here.

Id: [0x000793A9]
!*Hello!

Id: [0x000793C6]
!*Sorcery. That's what it is.

Id: [0x000793C8]
!*Not so. Every Mechanism that gives this Device its Light is a true and physical Thing. Ancient yes, but Nothing supernatural or strange.

Id: [0x000793CA]
!*We'll be Masters of the Ocean with that.

Id: [0x000793CC]
!*Oh... Such Ambition.

Id: [0x000793D0]
!*There's nothing in my Code about Loyalty, Boy! You played your Role, but our Partnership is Done!

Id: [0x000793D2]
!*You're a dead Man, Roberts!

Id: [0x000793DC]
!*Ahoy Kenway. Who's this?

Id: [0x000793EA]
!*Aye. We'll make Something of it in Time.

Id: [0x000793EC]
!*We could keep a Fleet here, if we liked. And with a bit of fixing up, it'd be decent Place to call Home. Might even convince my Wife to come one Day.

Id: [0x000793EE]
!*You're married, are ya?

Id: [0x000793EF]
!*In God's Eyes, I am. She left me some Time ago.

Id: [0x000793F0]
!*Even so, keep that Fact hid away. Most of these Pirates don't respect a Man with higher Commitments than Rum and Plunder.

Id: [0x000793F3]
!*Meet me at twenty Degrees, three Minutes Latitude, just off the coast of Yucatan. I'll have Something to show you there in a few Weeks time.

Id: [0x000793F9]
!*The Violence he'd cause with this Thing would be subtle, but Heavy. Deadly, yet leaving no Mark.[Beat] Does that make Sense?

Id: [0x00079403]
!*I'm only seeing a Job done, Torres. As you'd have done with Me.

Id: [0x00079404]
!*As we have done, I think. You have no Family anymore, no Friends, no Future. Your Losses are far greater than ours.

Id: [0x00079407]
!*You would see all of Mankind corralled into a neatly furnished Prison, safe and sober, yet dulled beyond Reason and sapped of all Spirit.

Id: [0x0007940E]
!*[Heavy breath]If you could speak, Mate... it would gladden me to hear your Side.

Id: [0x00079410]
!*[A hard exhale]

Id: [0x00079412]
!*You humbled me once and I took that hard Lesson and I bettered myself. Die knowing that for all our Conflict, you helped make a Soldier out of a Scoundrel.

Id: [0x00079415]
!*Leave this Life for a lasting Peace, down among the Dead.

Id: [0x00079418]
!*We got word Torres left the City. Who were you chasing?

Id: [0x00079419]
!*That Vial was labeled Torres, but held the Blood of his Second.[beat] Where's he gone?

Id: [0x0007941D]
!*The Observatory.

Id: [0x0007942C]
!*There's no drinking after Death, Lads, so fill up here with what you'll lack in Hell!

Id: [0x0007942D]
!*[Laughing]

Id: [0x0007942E]
!*Argh! Got a powerful Bite this Barbadian Swill. A pinch of Gunpowder might cut the Sting.

Id: [0x0007942F]
!*Where's my Lady got to?[Breath out]

Id: [0x00079430]
!*All hands on Deck!

Id: [0x00079431]
!*Half to Quarters, half Aloft!

Id: [0x00079432]
!*Hoist Anchor!

Id: [0x000795C5]
!*I found your Man!

Id: [0x000795D0]
!*Roberts!

Id: [0x000795D1]
!*I said not to follow!

Id: [0x000795D9]
!*[Whispering]Yes, and yet all for a greater Purpose. To ensure Justice. To snuff out Lies and to seek Truth.

Id: [0x000795DA]
!*There's no Man on Earth who needs that Power.

Id: [0x000795E2]
!*Torres awakened something fierce! Are we safe?

Id: [0x000795E3]
!*With the Device returned, I believe so.

!*[MY][Jets' a wóol te' suutukila'. Ka' weenen.](Quiet now. Go back to sleep.)

Id: [0x000795EE]
!*We will seal this Place, and discard the Key. Until another Sage appears, this Door will remain locked.

Id: [0x000795EF]
!*You could join us in that Cause.

Id: [0x000795F1]
!*I will. But... only after I fix what I mangled back Home.

Id: [0x000795FC]
!*Perhaps another Day.

Id: [0x000795FD]
!*What?

Id: [0x000795FE]
!*Next time, see to it that we are not followed![Loudly] Deal with this!

Id: [0x00079601]
!*Another?

Id: [0x00079603]
!*A Rum Flip this Time.

Id: [0x00079604]
!*And where'd I find fresh Eggs in this wretched Town? There's little else but Piss and Insects.

Id: [0x00079606]
!*Aye. We're working on that.

Id: [0x0007960D]
!*Walk with us, Kenway. There's Trouble brewing...

Id: [0x0007960F]
!*Gentlemen. How do you find it here?

Id: [0x00079610]
!*It will work for us. But our Goal must be to scatter our Operations. To live and work among the People we protect, just as Altair Ibn La-Ahad once counseled.

Id: [0x00079611]
!*Well until that Time, it's yours as you see fit.

Id: [0x00079613]
!*Edward...

Id: [0x00079615]
!*Captain Woodes Rogers survived his Wounds. He has since returned to England... shamed and in great Debt, but no less a Threat.

Id: [0x00079616]
!*I will finish that Job when I return. You have my Word.

Id: [0x00079617]
!*Evening, Anne.

Id: [0x00079619]

Id: [0x0007961A]
!*Will you stay with the Assassins?

Id: [0x0007961B]
!*No. I haven't got that kind of Conviction in my Heart.[Beat] You?

Id: [0x0007961D]
!*Sail ho! Coming into the Cove!

Id: [0x00079632]
!*Well, goodly Anne I-

Id: [0x00079635]
!*I found one Crate hidden beneath a school of Sharks. Sadly, the Elixir inside is...

Id: [0x00079637]
!*...quite spoilt.

Id: [0x00079639]
!*Eagh!

Id: [0x0007963A]
!*Plague and perish! Will we steal Medicines now?

Id: [0x0007963C]
!*Remember the Pardon, Thatch. We're to be Subtle.

Id: [0x0007963F]
!*Ahoy! Any Luck?

Id: [0x00079640]
!*Says Hornigold! A Pirate now too proud to call himself one!

Id: [0x00079641]
!*Ah, he prefers Caution to Cannons.

Id: [0x00079643]
!*And would you be the Devil?

Id: [0x00079645]

Id: [0x00079647]
!*Looks fine.

Id: [0x00079648]
!*'Course it does.

Id: [0x0007964B]

Id: [0x00079651]

Id: [0x00079664]
!*Kill him?

Id: [0x00079667]
!*When we see the Sage, you bring in the Rest of the Gold, make the Swap, and get out. I'll be watching from close by.

Id: [0x0007966B]
!*I've no need for Schooling. How many Prizes did we take together as Privateers?

Id: [0x0007966E]
!*There's a Chasm of difference between joining a Raid, and Captaining one.

Id: [0x0007966F]
!*That may be. But killing you rights a far greater Wrong than ever I did.

Id: [0x00079670]
!*You Honestly believe that?

Id: [0x00079671]
!*So, aye... with everything I've seen and learned in these last Years, I do believe it.

Id: [0x00079673]
!*You wear your Convictions well. They suit you...

Id: [0x00079674]
!*Yet you suffer the Outlaw Roberts to use it!

Id: [0x00079675]
!*No. I'm taking it back. And If you tell me where he is, I'll stop the Man.

Id: [0x00079677]
!*[Laughs]Here at the Edge of a Blade, I find a Friend in you at last! Principé, you mad Bastard. Our best Sources say Principé...

Id: [0x0007967D]

Id: [0x00079680]

Id: [0x00079687]
!*Hello?

Id: [0x00079689]
!*Jenkins! Is you out here?

Id: [0x0007969B]
!*Where's the Flagship of this motley Fleet?

Id: [0x0007969C]
!*Peace, Thatch. Careful what you whish for.

Id: [0x0007969E]
!*Is it a Man-O-War?

Id: [0x000796A0]
!*Will we follow?

Id: [0x000796A2]
!*Send Word to Ah Tabai. We've cornered our Man.

Id: [0x000796A4]
!*A manky looking Thing. Is that what I think it is?

Id: [0x000796A5]
!*Aye. Watch.

Id: [0x000796A7]
!*Through the blood of the Governor, we can see through his Eyes.

Id: [0x000796AB]
!*Keep this safe. Just in case.

Id: [0x000796AE]

Id: [0x000796B3]
!*I feel nothing but a hot Wind in my Ears, Captain.

Id: [0x000796B4]
!*Come on, Man. When we take this Treasure, we'll be set for Life. All of us. Ten times over.

Id: [0x000796B5]
!*As you wish.

Id: [0x000796B7]
!*Ahoy, Roberts! We'll cast Anchor and meet ashore.

Id: [0x000796B8]
!*You were followed, Captain Kenway. How long for, I wonder?

Id: [0x000796BA]
!*It's Hornigold.

Id: [0x000796BB]
!*Deal with your old Friend in Haste, Captain. Before I regret my Favor to you.

Id: [0x000796C6]
!*I'll be sailing for London in the next few Months.[Beat] I'd be a hopeful Man if you were beside me.

Id: [0x000796D9]
!*Set a Course, due North, Lads. We're off to find Captain Thatch!

Id: [0x000796E6]
!*...Stealing a fishing Schooner single-Handed? Damned canny, Captain.

Id: [0x000796E7]
!*Hang in there, Man. We're getting close.

Id: [0x000796EB]
!*Aye, you could sail with me, but... with a Temper as hot as yours, I fear you'd burn us all to Cinders.

Id: [0x000796EC]
!*On your Feet.

Id: [0x000796ED]
!*Jaysus, Adé. What the Hell happened here?

Id: [0x000796EE]
!*I'm not an easy Man to call a Friend, am I? Is that why you're here?

Id: [0x000796F5]
!*Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x00079708]
!*You there! Get lost!

Id: [0x0007AD27]
!*Oh don't be jealous!

Id: [0x0007AD28]
!*Jealous? I'm not jealous!

Id: [0x0007AD29]
!*I'll show you the Bill of Sale if you like. Senorita Marquez's right hand man, Vargas, signed it Himself. She is using his Home as her Headquarters. I even met her there when I delivered the Fish!

Id: [0x0007AD30]
!*I did! But you know, this is exactly why they call me the King of Fishermen!

Id: [0x0007AD31]
!*Who calls you that?

Id: [0x0007AD33]
!*Stranger! What are you doing?

Id: [0x0007AD36]
!*As is taking back my Brig from this Pillock. Once again, I thank you both.

Id: [0x0007AEE8]
!*Here's another Door. Looks to be the last Mechanism...

Id: [0x0007AEED]
!*I think I fixed that for ya.

Id: [0x0007AF0D]
!*[Effort long.]

Id: [0x0007AF1E]
!*[Interrogation, 'uh?'.]

Id: [0x0007AF3B]
!*Sorry, Mate. Wish it were otherwise.

Id: [0x0007AF3F]
!*Damn you, old Scratch! Keep your Natty hands off me!

Id: [0x0007AF40]
!*I can't let you Kill those Men, Kidd. Not until I've found the Sage.

Id: [0x0007AF41]
!*I been stalking that Pig for a Week now, charting his Moves! And here I find not one but TWO of my Targets... and you rob me of both!

Id: [0x0007AF45]
!*Follow us.

Id: [0x0007AF47]
!*If she is, we are not safe.

Id: [0x0007AF49]
!*You think this Woman is related?

Id: [0x0007AF4D]
!*The Bill of Sale we stole gives the Address of a Man in her Employ, Vargas.

Id: [0x0007AF50]
!*No. It's more than your Key. There are those who say the Taíno are already extinct. But we will never be extinguished. Our Fight continues.

Id: [0x0007AF53]
!*You must hide.

Id: [0x0007AF54]
!*Right there. Take Position.

Id: [0x0007AF57]
!*Chase him!

Id: [0x0007AF59]
!*[Sigh]Here's my Prize.

Id: [0x0007AF64]
!*Patience, Man.[Beat] You'll have your Kills.

Id: [0x0007AF66]
!*When I locate the Sage, you're helping me take Prins. Got that?

Id: [0x0007AF73]
!*Whatever improves my Lot in Life.

Id: [0x0007AF74]
!*Burn and flay that Turncoat.

Id: [0x0007AF76]
!*Not today.

Id: [0x0007AF7A]
!*To fight beside a Man so driven by personal Gain and Glory is a hard Thing, Edward. And I have come to feel the Assassins - and their Creed - a more honourable Course.

Id: [0x0007AF83]
!*Will you hand over the charm, sweet thing, or is it a physical exam you crave? I assure you, I've brought all of my instruments.

Id: [0x0007AF8F]
!*[Death, last breaths.]

Id: [0x0007AF90]
!*[Last dying breaths.]

Id: [0x0007AFA7]
!*But Gold is a Language we all speak, isn't it?

Id: [0x0007AFAA]
!*Here's my Dilemma. Shall I find a Secret way in? Or slip past those Soldiers?

Id: [0x0007AFAB]
!*Mary?[Beat] Mary, It's me! Edward!

Id: [0x0007AFAC]
!*Edward? Who's this Fella!

Id: [0x0007AFAE]
!*She's ill.

Id: [0x0007AFAF]
!*And her Child?

Id: [0x0007AFB3]
!*Can you walk?

Id: [0x0007AFB6]
!*I know it pains, M'Lady. But we must be silent.

Id: [0x0007AFBB]
!*Lean on me, Mary. Come on.

Id: [0x0007AFBC]
!*[effort sounds]I can't... [Out of breath, struggling]

Id: [0x0007AFBD]
!*Search every Cell!

Id: [0x0007AFBE]

Id: [0x0007AFC1]
!*You're all right.

Id: [0x0007AFC5]
!*[Effort sound]I ain't leaving you nowhere! No bloody way!

Id: [0x0007AFC6]
!*There's no one here!

Id: [0x0007AFC7]
!*Put me down, Edward!

Id: [0x0007AFCB]
!*[Pained breaths]Don't die on my Account. Go.

Id: [0x0007AFD2]
!*Aye, Edward. For I've another Calling elsewhere.

Id: [0x0007AFD5]
!*Have I been unfair?

Id: [0x0007AFDB]
!*[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007AFDC]

Id: [0x0007AFF1]
!*I need you to follow closely behind me. Do you think you can keep up?

Id: [0x0007AFF5]
!*I will go after the doctor!

Id: [0x0007AFFB]
!*[Groans of agony]

Id: [0x0007B009]
!*None of your concern.

Id: [0x0007B00A]
!*I'll force it from you.

Id: [0x0007B00B]
!*I'm no turncoat.

Id: [0x0007B00E]
!*Where is she?

Id: [0x0007B010]
!*[Short groans of agony]

Id: [0x0007B01F]

!*Fine![Sigh]

Id: [0x0007B036]
!*Then let's go.

Id: [0x0007B041]
!*I'll scout ahead.

Id: [0x0007B042]
!*Follow me.

Id: [0x0007B043]
!*How do I get up there?

Id: [0x0007B044]
!*I'll show you.

Id: [0x0007B045]
!*You can make that jump?

Id: [0x0007B046]
!*Watch.

Id: [0x0007B047]
!*Give me a boost?

Id: [0x0007B048]
!*I'm stuck again.

Id: [0x0007B049]
!*Run ahead.

Id: [0x0007B04A]
!*Steady does it.

Id: [0x0007B04D]
!*Wait. Look.

Id: [0x0007B04F]
!*Now what.

Id: [0x0007B052]
!*'Course. 'Cause that worked so well the last time...

Id: [0x0007B053]
!*We are sitting ducks.

Id: [0x0007B054]
!*Shh.

Id: [0x0007B05C]
!*He's a Templar, like Rogers and Hornigold. Men cooking up Schemes to use the Observatory for ill Purposes. For Power and Control.

Id: [0x0007B060]
!*What d'ye call this Place?

Id: [0x0007B077]
!*Aye, not happy with his Progress in Nassau.

Id: [0x0007B078]
!*Still too many Pirates roaming about, from what I hear.

Id: [0x0007B07B]
!*Grab your Kit and pack well. We're sailing for Africa.

Id: [0x0007B07F]
!*Understood.[Beat] Will you send this to England for me?

Id: [0x0007B081]
!*[MY][Yaan u muuk' a wóol yéetel a piixan](You have Strength and Spirit.) And once more you have our Thanks, Edward. You are welcome here.

Id: [0x0007B085]
!*She's a strong Woman. But not invincible.

Id: [0x0007B08A]
!*What's our Course?

Id: [0x0007B08B]
!*Kingston. I mean to stop what I set in Motion six years back. That means killing Rogers, Roberts, and Torres... and taking back that damned Device.

Id: [0x0007B08C]
!*That'll fetch us a nice Price.

Id: [0x0007B08D]
!*No. [A beat]Not this Time.

Id: [0x0007B08F]
!*It arrived last week.

Id: [0x0007B091]
!*There were Vials when I came here last. Filled with the Blood of ancient Men, Roberts said. But they're gone now.

Id: [0x0007B093]
!*Then it's up to us to Recover them. Before the Templars catch Wind of this.

Id: [0x0007B095]
!*It's done.

Id: [0x0007B097]
!*Where now?

Id: [0x0007B09C]
!*It's how long to Principé, Captain?

Id: [0x0007B09D]
!*With a fair Wind, eight Weeks is possible.

Id: [0x0007B09E]
!*Christ. On a half-pint of Rum a day, we'll be Dry in Four.

Id: [0x0007B0A8]
!*Thank you, Sir. I'll rest here a Time before setting out, if I may.

Id: [0x0007B0AA]
!*Might be this is God's way of saying I'm not fit to be a Mother yet. Carrying on like I do. cursing, and drinking, and fighting.

Id: [0x0007B0AF]
!*More?

Id: [0x0007B0B0]
!*Bring a Bottle.

Id: [0x0007B0B1]
!*I'd see some Colour first.

Id: [0x0007B0B6]
!*She's eighty Guns or more!

Id: [0x0007B0BA]
!*Stop!

Id: [0x0007B0BB]
!*I don’t want to hurt you!

Id: [0x0007B0BC]
!*[Groan of pain.]

Id: [0x0007B0BD]
!*Thank you.

Id: [0x0007B0BE]
!*Hold her there. There’s only one place left it could be. I'll get it out of her.

Id: [0x0007B0CA]
!*Nevermind. I will be more careful next time.

Id: [0x0007B0D3]
!*Which way did he go?

Id: [0x0007B0DE]
!*Levers and platforms... The tower is full of tricks and mysteries.

Id: [0x0007B0DF]
!*What does this do?

!*Push!

Id: [0x0007B0E8]
!*Listen- the Doctor.

Id: [0x0007B0E9]
!*You go ahead. I'll climb around the other way. We'll flank him.

Id: [0x0007B0EC]
!*You deceived me.

Id: [0x0007B0ED]
!*Did I?

Id: [0x0007B0EE]

Id: [0x0007B0F1]
!*Its magic is not for you.

Id: [0x0007B1EA]
!*I'll catch you up.

Id: [0x0007B1F3]
!*Rest and repast while you can, Kenway. It's a long way to Nassau.

Id: [0x0007B1F7]
!*Which one of you Scabs drank my breakfast!

Id: [0x0007B1FA]
!*Mmmh

Id: [0x0007B20A]
!*[pain grunt]

Id: [0x0007B20D]
!*[Laugh] Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007B211]
!*It may be he remembers where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x0007B213]
!*[Laughing.]

Id: [0x0007B217]
!*I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007B21A]
!*Uncork this man some Breakfast, will ye[Laugh]?

Id: [0x0007B21C]
!*We give awards for top-notch employees doing quality work.

Id: [0x0007B21D]
!*And they're nice to have, since there's no official bonus scheme here.

Id: [0x0007B21E]
!*I already have about eleven or so-

Id: [0x0007B220]
!*Oh... [FR][Bonjour?](Hello?)... Of course ... I'll pass it on.

Id: [0x0007B223]
!*Well... looks like Olivier wants to meet with you. It's exciting!

Id: [0x0007B225]
!*Follow me.

Id: [0x0007B227]
!*It's on the top floor, so it's not hard to find.

Id: [0x0007B228]
!*But the rest of this building can be confusing to first-timers, so we had the tools team whip up a great Map application...

Id: [0x0007B229]
!*Check your communicator. I added a waypoint to Olivier's office.

Id: [0x0007B22D]
!*It should be easy to find.

Id: [0x0007B231]
!*There you go. See there?

Id: [0x0007B238]
!*Olivier's a nice guy. He won't bite.

Id: [0x0007B246]
!*We met earlier. I was calibrating your Animus. I'm sort of the, uh... Scotty of this Abstergo enterprise ... in charge of all the techie stuff.

Id: [0x0007B249]
!*You're better at this than I'd hoped. Now zip on down to the lobby. Come on!

Id: [0x0007B24A]
!*Anyway, the courier should be waiting downstairs. She's been here a while.

Id: [0x0007B24E]
!*The couriers are waiting on you.

Id: [0x0007B250]
!*I'd deliver that package myself but I'm deep into some database coding.

Id: [0x0007B252]
!*It's a bit rude making the couriers await.

Id: [0x0007B254]
!*What are you, some kind of diva? Go see the courier!

Id: [0x0007B256]
!*You're just being ridiculous now.

Id: [0x0007B258]
!*Man, I cannot wait to write your performance evaluation next year. Less than satisfactory.

Id: [0x0007B267]
!*Hey, I just got word the courier has come and gone. Wonderful. You're a miracle.

Id: [0x0007B269]
!*No, no, no that's an exaggeration. You're not a miracle. You're an employee. Doing a job.

Id: [0x0007B26A]
!*But thanks for helping out.

Id: [0x0007B27D]
!*On the Roofs!

Id: [0x0007B284]
!*I'll take care of this one!

Id: [0x0007B28E]
!*Ah, A little Help would be nice!

Id: [0x0007B28F]
!*Remember me? Your bleeding Friend?

Id: [0x0007B2A5]
!*[SP][Acérquese, tengo el mejor ron de los mares del Sur.](Step right up! Finest Rum in the South Seas!)

Id: [0x0007B2A6]
!*[SP][Sí, usted. ¿Qué desea?](Yes, you sir, what'll it be?)

Id: [0x0007B2A8]
!*That's not a bad Start.

Id: [0x0007B2AA]
!*Let's take the Guards on the Rooftops first.

Id: [0x0007B2AB]
!*Don't hold back, Rhona.

Id: [0x0007B2B4]
!*Good. Let's move on. No Time to lose.

Id: [0x0007B2B6]
!*If he rings that Bell, we're done for.

Id: [0x0007B2B9]
!*Great. Let's get out of here. Day's a wasting.

Id: [0x0007B2BB]
!*That was a great bit of Sport. Hope it helps.

Id: [0x0007B2BC]
!*Mark my words, I'll find that Man and destroy him.

Id: [0x0007B2BD]
!*"Destroy." Is that what you're calling it now?

Id: [0x0007B2BE]
!*So will you, if you want your Key.

Id: [0x0007B2BF]
!*I suppose I've done stranger.

Id: [0x0007B2C4]
!*Oh, He won't be hard to find, the cheeky Bastard, strutting about like the Cock of the Walk.

Id: [0x0007B2C5]
!*Admit it, Rhona. Deep down, you like the walk of that Cock.

Id: [0x0007B2C6]
!*Of course it's not the same here as Home in England, but there's a Wild quality I've come to enjoy.

Id: [0x0007B2D4]
!*Hey Flint!

Id: [0x0007B2D5]
!*You should know, Dinsmore.

Id: [0x0007B2E3]
!*The charm he took belonged to my mother. It gave her strength and foresight, as it did her mother before her. As it did me. Without it, I am blind.

Id: [0x0007B2E4]
!*You will have it back soon. I will make sure of it.

Id: [0x0007B2E8]
!*Ah!

Id: [0x0007B2E9]
!*[Sharp gasp of surprise]

Id: [0x0007B2EB]
!*Sorry.

Id: [0x0007B2EC]
!*Sorry.

Id: [0x0007B2ED]
!*[brief embarassed laugh]

Id: [0x0007B2EE]
!*[brief annoyed snort]

Id: [0x0007B2F1]
!*Excellent.

Id: [0x0007B301]
!*The White Jaguar! A fine Catch. You have more than proven yourself. We accept your Help.

Id: [0x0007B302]
!*With what?

Id: [0x0007B303]
!*[Beat] Look!

Id: [0x0007B306]
!*[Sigh]Typical. Twist a Templar Blade to our Back to play Savior to our Face.

Id: [0x0007B307]
!*Look, I'll level with you, Lass.[Beat] I'm also looking for a Key. I figure I help you, you let me keep the Key if it turns up.

Id: [0x0007B309]
!*Right. You're offended. I'll go.

Id: [0x0007B30D]
!*Easy. Let's go.

Id: [0x0007B315]
!*I've got some Idea.

Id: [0x0007B317]
!*[SP][¡Hola!](Hello!)

Id: [0x0007B31F]
!*Let's see where this Lad goes.

Id: [0x0007B323]
!*I know she's here, Lucia Marquez. I can feel it.

Id: [0x0007B333]
!*Come Lucia, is this not what you want?

Id: [0x0007B334]
!*Your Father was never such a Coward!

Id: [0x0007B335]
!*Even alone I am stronger than all of your Men.

Id: [0x0007B345]
!*Hello, Hellooooooo. Do you have a second? Of course you do.

Id: [0x0007B347]
!*I'd like to link all the cameras in the building to a central monitoring system, but most aren't calibrated correctly.

Id: [0x0007B349]
!*Head to the waypoint on your map. I have another job for you.

Id: [0x0007B34E]
!*Another locked door. Not a problem.

Id: [0x0007B352]
!*Find the camera control station first.

Id: [0x0007B357]
!*-and if we want information on Assassins or Templars or the Observatory, or whatever the fuck else interests us, Olivier, you will deliver it. Full stop.

Id: [0x0007B358]
!*I understand that, Laetitia. I'm sorry if that came out wrong. We're not trying to be a bottleneck here. But we just don't have the resources right now to do two times the research.

Id: [0x0007B359]
!*Finding that balance is your priority. Your entertainment products are simply a means to pay the bills for larger and more important work. That's the way the world works, hm? Dirty money buys clean hospitals. You get it?

Id: [0x0007B35B]
!*We're on-board, Laetitia, rest assured. We have our best employee working on this. But it will take time.

Id: [0x0007B35C]
!*Good. And thank you. The both of you. I look forward to seeing what you deliver. Until then, I'll see you at the shareholders meeting, Olivier.

Id: [0x0007B35D]
!*Looking forward to it. Bye bye.

Id: [0x0007B35E]
!*Tabarnak![Pause] It's a little too early for that kind of abuse.[Beat] Come on.

Id: [0x0007B367]
!*Ah, I'm hurt!

Id: [0x0007B374]
!*Of course not![After a beat.] I just don't want you to feel like I'm telling you what to do.

Id: [0x0007B375]
!*I think that Injury must have left you with a touch of Fever.

Id: [0x0007B376]
!*[Breaths]Can we go now?

Id: [0x0007B377]
!*Edward, we've reduced that Templar cad, Flint, to a fraction of his Power. The only thing standing between you and your Key now is Flint himself.

Id: [0x0007B378]
!*You have an Approach in Mind?

Id: [0x0007B379]
!*Let's.

Id: [0x0007B37A]
!*I'll distract him. You circle around for the Kill.

Id: [0x0007B380]
!*What did you find out?

Id: [0x0007B381]
!*Managed to nab a Pickpocket. Sly Boots had a Map. Something about Storehouses and Gunpowder.

Id: [0x0007B382]
!*That's the same Name from the Map.

Id: [0x0007B383]
!*He's using Pickpockets to run an Arms Race.

Id: [0x0007B387]
!*Were you successful?

Id: [0x0007B388]
!*I kept overhearing this Name - Marquez.

Id: [0x0007B389]
!*[gasp]

Id: [0x0007B38A]
!*Friend of yours?

Id: [0x0007B38F]
!*He's getting away!

Id: [0x0007B394]
!*Stop them before they harm our Target!

Id: [0x0007B399]
!*She must be hiding. Let's take some Action she can't ignore.

Id: [0x0007B3B3]
!*And then he dismissed me. Without Pay! For Drunkenness!

Id: [0x0007B3B4]
!*Alleged Drunkenness.

Id: [0x0007B3B5]
!*All's I had to do was escort the Man North, no South, no. North. Definitely North.

Id: [0x0007B3BE]
!*They're holding the Cur nearby.

Id: [0x0007B3BF]
!*Whatever for?

Id: [0x0007B3C1]
!*I wouldn't linger here. The Walls have Ears, if you know what I mean.

Id: [0x0007B3C2]
!*Are we followed?

Id: [0x0007B3C3]
!*We must warn the Others!

Id: [0x0007B3D0]
!*[Effort Sounds while grabbing the enemy]You've got the Information I need, mate.

Id: [0x0007B3D1]
!*No![Heavy Breaths, panting] I've heard of your Kind... Ass- Assassin. Don't hurt me.

Id: [0x0007B3D2]
!*All I want to know is where this Slave is. Do you know of anyone being held... [a beat][note: By definition there are no free slaves. All of them are captive. So Edward needs to ask about slaves being held under special circumstances. Hence the pause before he chooses the word: "specially."] specially Like?

Id: [0x0007B3D3]
!*Please! Let me live. My Wife and Children--

Id: [0x0007B3D4]
!*Come on then, out with it.

Id: [0x0007B3D5]
!*Look near the Windmill.

Id: [0x0007B3D6]
!*See, was that so hard?

Id: [0x0007B3DB]
!*Ah, Aileen. Didn't see you come in.

Id: [0x0007B3E9]
!*I have now resumed the practice of dressing as a man, and have put off my woman's dress.

Id: [0x0007B3EB]
!*No no no... come on, Satish. Not you.

Id: [0x0007B3EC]
!*It wouldn't be permanent. A few months at most.

Id: [0x0007B3ED]
!*Months! That will kill every ounce of momentum we have!

Id: [0x0007B3EE]
!*It won't, I promise. Honestly, I think this could help us. If I can get a look at what his people are doing, we could-

Id: [0x0007B3EF]
!*Come on. He's try to pull you over to his side. You don't see that? He's luring you with quick victories and prestige.

Id: [0x0007B3F0]
!*That's not what this is about, honestly.

Id: [0x0007B3F1]
!*Aileen, I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0007B3F2]
!*Do what you must. I'll survive.

Id: [0x0007B3F3]
!*So... the main reason I asked you here concerns something called The Observatory. It's been mentioned a few times in the footage you found.

Id: [0x0007B3F4]
!*I'd like to encourage you to focus on locating this specific set of memories as soon as possible.

Id: [0x0007B3F5]
!*If it were up to me, [FR][on s'en crisse](we don't care)...  I wouldn't bother. But some bigwigs at Abstergo Industries have been hounding me for days.

Id: [0x0007B3F6]
!*So follow whatever leads you find, and hopefully we can a-

Id: [0x0007B3F8]
!*Incoming call. I have to take this.

Id: [0x0007B3FA]
!*[FR][Allen, bonjour. Oui. Oui, tout va bien. Naturellement.](Allen, hello. Yeah. Everything is fine. Of course I do.)

Id: [0x0007B3FC]
!*[FR] [Oui.](Yes.)

Id: [0x0007B3FD]
!*[FR] [D'accord.](Right.)

Id: [0x0007B3FE]
!*[FR][Oui, oui Bien sûr.](Yes, yes Of course.)

Id: [0x0007B3FF]
!*[FR] [Bon, d'accord.](Well, sure.)

Id: [0x0007B400]
!*[FR] [Pas vraiment.](Not really.)

Id: [0x0007B401]
!*[FR] [Pourquoi ?](Why?)

Id: [0x0007B402]
!*[FR] [Je ne sais pas si…](I can't really say...)

Id: [0x0007B405]
!*Don't give up on me, Caroline![Pause] Not when I need your Faith the most...

Id: [0x0007B409]
!*So, this is the Sample 17 floor. We're diving into the memories of one very Generous donor, Desmond Miles.

Id: [0x0007B40A]
!*We're pulling all the best stuff from his DNA... and hopefully, one day we can forge some fantastic experiences from what we find in there.

Id: [0x0007B40F]
!*Welcome to Animus Omega, Abstergo Entertainment's proprietary Ancestral Memory Research tool.

Id: [0x0007B410]
!*You have been registered as part of the SAMPLE 17 project. Your primary research target is EDWARD JAMES KENWAY. BORN MARCH 10 1693. SWANSEA, WALES.

Id: [0x0007B415]
!*If you have any questions, comments or concerns about how to operate your Animus console, please contact your Project Supervisor, MELANIE LEMAY.

Id: [0x0007B41C]
!*Calibrations complete. All signs normal, all systems optimal. Extra-neural Transmitters activated.

Id: [0x0007B425]
!*So I reviewed some of your data. Pretty raw stuff! Obviously we need to scrub off some of the dirt to make it family friendly.

Id: [0x0007B426]
!*Maybe give Edward a voice like James Bond or something. More of a ladies man.

Id: [0x0007B429]
!*Hey you. Do have a minute? I'm on my way upstairs.

Id: [0x0007B42A]
!*Olivier wanted to talk with us about putting together a trailer using some of the footage you've been recording this past month.

Id: [0x0007B42C]
!*Take your time. I'll meet you by the elevator.

Id: [0x0007B42F]
!*I just watched some of your footage from this week. It's amazing. Blackbeard was mental!

Id: [0x0007B430]
!*And we all got so excited that we started talking about this idea for a trailer about him... maybe start with him drinking, talking to some pirates, telling a story...

Id: [0x0007B431]
!*Then, we cut to him leaping across the deck of his boat and- Sorry, his ship. Not boat.

Id: [0x0007B432]
!*But jumping around the deck of his ship, swinging from ropes, and fighting like a Devil. I mean, obviously we'll have to manipulate some of the existing footage to get it looking good but-

Id: [0x0007B433]
!*It could be great. I'm getting a shiver in me timbers just thinking about it.[Laughs] Sorry.

Id: [0x0007B44E]
!*So... what's next?

Id: [0x0007B451]
!*[Laughing] Assassins. Templars... crazy talk.

Id: [0x0007B453]
!*Sounds like crackpot stuff, I know. But then again, the moon landing was faked, right? So anything's possible.

Id: [0x0007B45E]
!*You can't waltz into Olivier's office through the front door, so I've opened another route.

Id: [0x0007B46F]
!*You're not Sweet on him, are you?

Id: [0x0007B4A8]
!*What do you want, Englishman?

Id: [0x0007B4A9]
!*Edward Kenway. I'm here to warn you of Danger. [Beat]And I'm Welsh.

Id: [0x0007B4AC]
!*You all look the same to me. Why should I need your Warning? My life is all Danger.

Id: [0x0007B4AD]
!*I may have brought it on you.

Id: [0x0007B4AE]
!*[Laughing]This means you owe me.

Id: [0x0007B4DA]
!*I found your Men.

Id: [0x0007B4DB]
!*And I found where his Brothers are kept. Help me release them.

Id: [0x0007B4DC]
!*No, Mate. I've settled my Debt. Meddling with slaves is none of my Affair. I doubt there’s even a Templar behind it at all.

Id: [0x0007B4DD]
!*All affairs of freedom are Assassin affairs.

Id: [0x0007B4E0]
!*What is your Price?

Id: [0x0007B4E1]
!*What?

Id: [0x0007B4E2]
!*A Man without principle must be moved by Coin. How much do you need?

Id: [0x0007B4E3]
!*There is a Key I’m looking for. Belongs to a Set I’ve been stripping off Templars.

Id: [0x0007B4E4]
!*The Templar Keys? I thought they’d been destroyed.

Id: [0x0007B4E5]
!*I’m not the only one who knows about them, then?

Id: [0x0007B4E6]
!*If we find it, it's yours.

Id: [0x0007B4E7]
!*You have a Deal. Let’s go get your Friends.

Id: [0x0007B4E9]
!*Slaves, you mean?

Id: [0x0007B4EA]
!*Brothers, Warriors, the Hope of the Maroons.

Id: [0x0007B4EB]
!*Doesn't sound like my Business, Mate.

Id: [0x0007B4EC]
!*All I need is for you to mingle with your Countrymen. Listen to Hints for where my Friends are held.

Id: [0x0007B4ED]
!*Fine.[Beat] I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x0007B4F5]
!*Hurry! To my Bureau.

Id: [0x0007B507]
!*Where to, next?

Id: [0x0007B508]
!*That’s enough Work for one night. Or do you grow fond of it?

Id: [0x0007B509]
!*That’s it? No Templar? What about the Key?

Id: [0x0007B50A]
!*The Templar did not show himself. You will have your Key next Time.

Id: [0x0007B50B]
!*No, Antó, there is no next Time.

Id: [0x0007B50C]
!*When you discover your Conscience or admit how badly you want the Key, there will be a next Time.

Id: [0x0007B50E]
!*You returned. Have you brought your Conscience?

Id: [0x0007B50F]
!*I want... my Key.

Id: [0x0007B510]
!*Patience is a Virtue.

Id: [0x0007B512]
!*Expecting Company?

Id: [0x0007B513]
!*You may have your Key sooner than you think. Help us defend the Bureau. The Men we freed will help.

Id: [0x0007B53B]
!*Oh these Templars. They run our lives, you know?

Id: [0x0007B540]
!*[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007B541]
!*Consider it motivating.

Id: [0x0007B542]
!*That's not fair.

Id: [0x0007B57E]
!*They decide elections, they control various capital markets, and they inject us with little microchips to track our movements and read our thoughts.

Id: [0x0007B581]
!*[SP][¡Eh, al ladrón!](Hey! Thief!)

Id: [0x0007B5A0]
!*What I miss the most is the Fox Hunt.

Id: [0x0007B5A1]
!*Of course, there's plenty of other Game to be found. One needs only be creative.

Id: [0x0007B5A2]
!*I like mine with Teeth.[Beat] The chase is more fun when the Prey bites back.

Id: [0x0007B5A3]
!*I hope you feel well. You look good.[Beat] Can you stand?

Id: [0x0007B5A9]
!*Attack!

Id: [0x0007B5AC]
!*It is too quiet. I do not trust it. There will be more of them.

Id: [0x0007B5AD]
!*Remain alert, men! More will be coming.

Id: [0x0007B5AE]
!*Edward! Eliminate as many as you can before the next Wave!

Id: [0x0007B5BC]
!*Edward, I am glad you showed up when you did. I’m sorry I have no Key to give you, but-

Id: [0x0007B5BD]
!*No. The Key can wait.[after a beat] Whoever did this, I want to teach him a Lesson.

!*The Templar’s Name is Kenneth Abraham. He's part of an ongoing War with the Maroons. But we have held strong, and will not be defeated.

Id: [0x0007B5BF]
!*Let me devise a Plan.

Id: [0x0007B5C1]
!*I have a Plan but it won't be easy. Abraham is well connected and his Pockets are deep. But we have located a Man in his inner Circle. We will tail him until he reveals our Target.

Id: [0x0007B5C3]
!*Here he comes now.

Id: [0x0007B5C6]
!*Evening.

Id: [0x0007B5C7]
!*Sir.

Id: [0x0007B5C8]
!*Pleasant night for a Ball.

Id: [0x0007B5CA]
!*Now, if you'll excuse me. I have a private Matter to attend before I make my Entrance.

Id: [0x0007B5CB]
!*As do I.

Id: [0x0007B5CC]
!*We will see you there.

Id: [0x0007B5CE]
!*Good Evening. Will the Commander be in attendance tonight?

Id: [0x0007B5CF]
!*Yes, I was just speaking with him. He is here somewhere.

Id: [0x0007B5D0]
!*Yes, I just left him. Hard to spot in his dress Uniform.

Id: [0x0007B5D3]
!*[Pained]Antó. How many Years have we fought? Your Men, in the Mountains, with no Weapons to speak of. And my army, resplendent. And yet you live, and I die...

Id: [0x0007B5D6]
!*[A last dying breath]

Id: [0x0007B5DA]
!*You lacked the Conviction to win.

Id: [0x0007B5E5]
!*[Fight Grunt]

Id: [0x0007B5E6]
!*Look up.

Id: [0x0007B5E7]
!*Down.

Id: [0x0007B5E8]
!*Right.

Id: [0x0007B5E9]
!*And left...

Id: [0x0007B5ED]
!*I'll let you do the honors. We're headed up to the Sample 17 studio. Second floor.

Id: [0x0007B5EE]
!*Not fixing. Calibrating.

Id: [0x0007B5FC]
!*[FR][Bonjour!](Hello!)

Id: [0x0007B601]
!*This is all yours, so sit back, relax, and find us some good footage.

Id: [0x0007B60C]
!*Is something wrong?

Id: [0x0007B60D]
!*Olivier said to go right in.

Id: [0x0007B60E]
!*You're not nervous are you? He's a very nice guy.

Id: [0x0007B60F]
!*Go on in.

Id: [0x0007B643]
!*Now, you need to bypass the core to find the data inside. Once you reach it, your communicator will download it automatically.

Id: [0x0007B644]
!*This is how you control the program in the core.

Id: [0x0007B645]
!*You need to find your way around the core to reach the data inside.

Id: [0x0007B646]
!*Once you move your program, it will remain intact until it reaches an obstacle or until you find the core.

Id: [0x0007B649]
!*Hey. You ready?

Id: [0x0007B64A]
!*Over here. Olivier's waiting on us.

Id: [0x0007B64B]
!*If you need to use the toilet first, make it snappy.

Id: [0x0007B64C]
!*Good to go?

Id: [0x0007B651]
!*[Laughs.]

Id: [0x0007B654]
!*Travers?

Id: [0x0007B655]
!*What Tide brings you? You dress the part of an Assassin, yet I don't know your Face.

Id: [0x0007B656]
!*Name’s Kenway. I'm here to warn you of a Threat to your Bureau.

Id: [0x0007B659]
!*Yes, I have noticed some suspicious Men lurking about. I believe they work for a noted Templar, called Upton. Could you... eliminate them for me?

Id: [0x0007B65A]
!*Oh, I may be persuaded, for a Price. You wouldn't happen to know anything about a Templar Key, would you?

Id: [0x0007B65B]
!*I'm sure you can find it among Upton's men, IF I tell you where they are.

Id: [0x0007B65C]
!*[Sigh to approve]You've got yourself a deal.

Id: [0x0007B673]
!*Who sent you? Why are you dressed like that, Templar?

Id: [0x0007B675]
!*I’m no such thing.

Id: [0x0007B676]
!*You’re no Assassin. I run the bureau. I’d know you if you were one of us.

Id: [0x0007B677]
!*That's rich. I've met the leader. You’re not him!

Id: [0x0007B678]
!*[Out of breath]Stop! I am Upton Travers. Bureau leader.

Id: [0x0007B67E]
!*My blood brother! We work together.[Beat] And those were not Templars that you killed! They were my workers!

Id: [0x0007B67F]
!*Don't blame me. Your brother ordered it.

Id: [0x0007B683]
!*Does he mean to usurp me?

Id: [0x0007B684]
!*I don't know mate, I'm only after a Templar key.

Id: [0x0007B685]
!*A what? [after a beat] Please, I need for you to tell me everything.

Id: [0x0007B687]
!*And why should I trust you?

Id: [0x0007B688]
!*Meet me at the bureau. And I will show you.

Id: [0x0007B68D]
!*What?[Beat] Is Vance your...

Id: [0x0007B691]
!*[Sigh]Bother.

Id: [0x0007B697]
!*My lovesick idiot of a brother has misled you.

Id: [0x0007B698]
!*[With a weary sigh] Start from the start, mate.

Id: [0x0007B69B]
!*Recently, our trade introduced us to a formidable woman- Jing Lang, a pirate from the farthest seas of the Orient.

Id: [0x0007B69C]
!*Intriguing.

Id: [0x0007B69D]
!*She and Vance quickly became inseparable.

Id: [0x0007B69E]
!*Any reason he should have thought your men were spies?

Id: [0x0007B69F]
!*Well, there is the treasure.

Id: [0x0007B6A0]
!*Oh?

Id: [0x0007B6A1]
!*A pirate sold us a map. We each kept half.

Id: [0x0007B6A9]
!*Come. I will meet him now. If you follow with discretion, you may hear it for yourself.

Id: [0x0007B6BA]
!*Good day, my brother.

Id: [0x0007B6BB]
!*Good day, "brother" if I may still call you that.

Id: [0x0007B6CC]
!*Idiots! You're all Idiots!

Id: [0x0007B6CD]
!*How you English believe you can subdue the World is beyond me!

Id: [0x0007B6CF]
!*Ah! Praise God for imported Wines.

Id: [0x0007B6D0]
!*Who can drink Rum more than once a Month?[IT][Mio Dio](My God)! It is revolting.

Id: [0x0007B6D2]
!*There is no Beauty to this City. No Expression of Joy. No aesthetic Plan! Ugh.

Id: [0x0007B6D3]
!*You walk your Streets like Animals! Like Cattle with no sense of Decorum!

Id: [0x0007B6D5]
!*Damn this sweltering Heat. Another Quaff, I think.

Id: [0x0007B6D6]
!*Ah! That hits the right Note. Mm... Sangiovese, the finest Grape in the World.

Id: [0x0007B6D8]
!*Bastardo! Now I am lost! How preposterous this City is! All straight Lines and rigid Blocks, and still no sense of Order!

Id: [0x0007B6D9]
!*Oh, how I miss the warm and winding Streets of Firenze! How I miss Culture!

Id: [0x0007B6DB]
!*Almost out of Wine.

Id: [0x0007B6DC]
!*I pray this Party is well stocked. For if they have only Rum and Molasses Cakes, I will assassinate the Host.

Id: [0x0007B6E5]
!*Good god man, what's happened to you?

Id: [0x0007B6E6]
!*I cannot go on anymore! My brother: a traitor. That woman... Templar. I have no family! No wife of my own! What is the point of living, hm? Let them kill me.

Id: [0x0007B6E7]
!*You don't know what you're saying mate. Let's get you some place safe.

Id: [0x0007B6E8]
!*What's the point?

Id: [0x0007B6E9]
!*The point is, I want my key, so I need you alive. I need your information, so I need you sober.

Id: [0x0007B6EA]
!*[Hard time breathing]You are my best friend. C'mere; I'll kill you.[Struggling grunts]

Id: [0x0007B6EB]
!*Come on mate, let's go.

Id: [0x0007B6EC]
!*No!

Id: [0x0007B6F9]
!*What are you looking at?

Id: [0x0007B6FA]
!*Hey, you there, with the sour Face. What's that you said about Mah maw?

Id: [0x0007B701]
!*The church! In the name of the father, the son, and the holy--

Id: [0x0007B703]
!*Let's just keep it moving, yeah?

Id: [0x0007B707]
!*Who are these creatures?

Id: [0x0007B70F]
!*Ahhh, that's much better.

Id: [0x0007B718]
!*Safety is an illusion. But yes, I have friends here. I can hide.

Id: [0x0007B719]
!*What you must think of me. Have I said anything embarrassing?

Id: [0x0007B71B]
!*Betrayal makes one philosophical, don't it?[Beat] Imagine. A templar. My brother to marry a Templar.

Id: [0x0007B71D]
!*I doubt it'll come to that.

Id: [0x0007B720]
!*Sober up mate. We'll finish this in the morning.

Id: [0x0007B72B]
!*[Effort Sounds, panting]I'm asking for a friend: do you know anything about some slaves held captive or whatnot?

Id: [0x0007B72C]
!*Who are you?

Id: [0x0007B72D]
!*Don't matter, mate.

Id: [0x0007B72E]
!*Get off me. I don’t know what you're on about.

Id: [0x0007B72F]
!*Are you sure?

Id: [0x0007B731]
!*Alright, alright.

Id: [0x0007B74D]
!*Officers, may I join you?

Id: [0x0007B74E]
!*Evening.

Id: [0x0007B74F]
!*The more the merrier.

Id: [0x0007B750]
!*The Prat was right under our Noses the whole Time!

Id: [0x0007B783]
!*Aveline, do you still call yourself Assassin? Whatever name you take, you came to me for help once and now I must ask the same of you.

Id: [0x0007B784]
!*There is a girl of uncanny strength and wit: Patience Gibbs. She is accused of leading a slave revolt, and her master has placed a high price on her capture. She is a hunted girl.

Id: [0x0007B785]
!*I have attempted to recruit Patience for the Brotherhood, but she will not allow me to approach her with help. Your name is legendary among the slaves, even as far North as Newport, I believe you will have more success. She was last seen on Goat Island. Start your search there, if you accept.

Id: [0x0007B786]
!*Your Friend and Brother, Connor.

Id: [0x0007B787]
!*Post-script: Take care to heed the fort, and Patience herself. I have learned the hard way; she is dangerous when startled.

Id: [0x0007B78D]
!*State your business!

Id: [0x0007B793]
!*[brief panicked shout]

Id: [0x0007B7A5]
!*What happened here?

Id: [0x0007B7A6]
!*We all escaped together. She helped us. She said a ship would come. But they found us.

Id: [0x0007B7A7]
!*Patience Gibbs. Our camp was just beyond that hill, but they ransacked it, and took us prisoner. They must be holding her there.

Id: [0x0007B7AF]
!*[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007B7B0]
!*[Pain grunt.]

Id: [0x0007B7B6]
!*Hurry up!

Id: [0x0007B7BB]
!*[Pained breath]Traitor!

Id: [0x0007B7BC]
!*It takes one to know one.

Id: [0x0007B7C0]
!*Jing Lang, as I live and breathe!

Id: [0x0007B7C9]
!*Really?

Id: [0x0007B7CA]
!*[Pained breath]Yes. I stole the real one. Both halves. My husband has it.

Id: [0x0007B7CB]
!*Your husband? [after a beat].

Id: [0x0007B7CD]
!*Imagine. The Queen of Pirates, Jing Lang, defeated for a fake map. I have been arrogant.[Pain short grunt]

Id: [0x0007B7D0]
!*As I sobered up, I began to see it more clearly. Jing has led my brother astray, and must be killed.

Id: [0x0007B7D1]
!*A better man than these fools.[A Dying Breath]

Id: [0x0007B7DB]
!*We must find her, draw her out, and put a final End to her.

Id: [0x0007B7DD]
!*Yes. Eliminate these Men.

Id: [0x0007B7DE]
!*Help me kill these Men.

Id: [0x0007B7E2]
!*Who are you?

Id: [0x0007B7E7]
!*Thank you.

Id: [0x0007B7E8]
!*At last.

Id: [0x0007B7E9]
!*Thanks.

Id: [0x0007B7ED]
!*Let's Uncork that poor fella some Breakfast, eh?

Id: [0x0007B7EF]
!*Let me bring him to his End.

Id: [0x0007B7F0]
!*I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007B7F1]
!*Pleasant Night to celebrate impending Victory.

Id: [0x0007B7F6]
!*I said she's a lovely woman. Inside and out.

Id: [0x0007B7F9]
!*So either way, one of them has the Templar key. You're obviously distraught. Let me take care of it.

Id: [0x0007B7FE]
!*I will tell you where to find them.

Id: [0x0007B800]
!*hm, You're looking better than last we met.

Id: [0x0007B802]
!*But Vance has also betrayed me. As an Assassin his treachery must be punished by death.

Id: [0x0007B80C]
!*Aesop once wrote of an Eagle, soaring high above a Shepherd's Field, that swooped down on powerful Wings to seize a grazing Lamb and carry it off to her Nest.

Id: [0x0007B80D]
!*Flying close by, a Jackdaw saw the Deed, and it filled his Head with the Idea that he too was just as strong and capable.

Id: [0x0007B80E]
!*So, with a great flapping and rustling of Feathers, the Jackdaw came down swiftly and clutched at the Coat of a large Ram.

Id: [0x0007B80F]
!*But when he tried to fly away, he found he could not lift the Animal, for his Size and Strength were not up to the Task.

Id: [0x0007B810]
!*And even as the Jackdaw struggled, the Ram hardly noticed he was there.<CR>

Id: [0x0007B811]
!*Nearby, just across the Field, the Shepherd saw the fluttering Bird and was quite amused.

Id: [0x0007B812]
!*Running up, he captured the Jackdaw and clipped its Wings.

Id: [0x0007B813]
!*That Evening he gave the Jackdaw to his Children as a Gift.<CR>

Id: [0x0007B814]
!*"What an odd little Bird this is, Father!" they laughed and shouted. "What do you call him?"<CR>

Id: [0x0007B815]
!*"This is a Jackdaw," the Father said. "But if you should ask him, he would claim to be an Eagle."

Id: [0x0007B82A]
!*I warned you-- I always know what you'll do, a second before you do.

Id: [0x0007B830]
!*This never would have happened if I still had the ch--

Id: [0x0007B833]
!*What's that?

Id: [0x0007B834]
!*You did not think I'd give up all my secrets so easily?

Id: [0x0007B835]
!*I'm learning not to. But how--

Id: [0x0007B839]
!*Does it work? It lets me see.

Id: [0x0007B83A]
!*Into m-

Id: [0x0007B83B]
!*Minds? No- into all things. Only for a few seconds, anyway.

Id: [0x0007B83C]
!*Long enough-

Id: [0x0007B83D]
!*-to escape.

Id: [0x0007B840]
!*Will this do?

Id: [0x0007B844]
!*That's my Prize, Roberts. Give it here!

Id: [0x0007B847]
!*Give it here!

Id: [0x0007B84A]
!*That's right, Boy! Take it!

Id: [0x0007B84B]
!*I'll sweeten you, Maggot! I'll cut you down!

Id: [0x0007B852]
!*Don't you dare give him Jaw!

Id: [0x0007B85A]
!*Roberts!

Id: [0x0007B85E]
!*Welcome aboard, Kenway! It's Prizes, Plunder and Adventure ahead. Are you Game?

Id: [0x0007B85F]
!*Outta my way, Ben.

Id: [0x0007B864]
!*We was told Nassau was a Place where Men could live and drink and fuck as they please!

Id: [0x0007B865]
!*Save keeping Others from doing the same.[Effort and struggling sounds till exit]

Id: [0x0007B869]
!*What Man with a sensible Mind would choose the former Life?

Id: [0x0007B86C]
!*Ah... you've Art and Wisdom for the Business of Piracy... but you haven't the Will needed to take it to a Conclusion!

Id: [0x0007B873]
!*Duncan Walpole, lately arrived! Yet just in time to hear a Tale.

Id: [0x0007B874]
!*Where is he? Where's Roberts?

Id: [0x0007B875]
!*Go on, Captain Rogers. Tell us.

Id: [0x0007B876]
!*Where's he gone!

Id: [0x0007B878]
!*As Gentlemen of Fortune we enjoy Plenty and Satisfaction, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power...

Id: [0x0007B879]
!*For I have dipped my Hands in muddied Waters, and withdrawing them find 'tis better to be a Commander than a Common man!

Id: [0x0007B87A]
!*No more than two Years! You promised me-

Id: [0x0007B87B]
!*You left! When I needed you the most.

Id: [0x0007B87C]
!*But you had me!

Id: [0x0007B87D]
!*I'm so close, Caroline! Please! Just let me do this!

Id: [0x0007B883]
!*Do you know where Judge is taking your charm?

Id: [0x0007B884]
!*My best bet is the Newport Tower. This tunnel will lead us there.

Id: [0x0007B89E]
!*We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x0007B8A0]
!*[Laughs]Were it not for Rum and Reales, we might have been Heroes, eh Kenway?

Id: [0x0007B8A4]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x0007B8AD]
!*'Pon my honour.[Beat] Let me know if you find Anything.

Id: [0x0007B8B6]
!*Try the Key you took from Du Casse.

Id: [0x0007B8B8]
!*That's one. Only four left.

Id: [0x0007B8B9]
!*Aye. It might be that these four Templars have them. See the Names here?

Id: [0x0007B8BD]
!*Not a nice way to kick off. But that is some damn fine Gear.

Id: [0x0007B8CB]
!*Now's the Time.

Id: [0x0007B8CC]
!*No. Not until we see the Sage.

Id: [0x0007B8F7]
!*Hello?

Id: [0x0007B8F8]
!*Aileen, hi. It's Karl.

Id: [0x0007B8F9]
!*Karl, I know it's you.

Id: [0x0007B8FA]
!*Sorry. You just... you sound exhausted. Did I wake you?

Id: [0x0007B8FB]
!*No... no, I'm... I've just been busy.

Id: [0x0007B8FC]
!*It sounds like it.

Id: [0x0007B8FD]
!*I'm just a little tired. That's all.

Id: [0x0007B8FE]
!*No, I mean... your project sounds fascinating. Your colleague, Doctor... Warren Vidic?... he called me recently and told me a what you'd been up to.

Id: [0x0007B8FF]
!*He what? Warren?

Id: [0x0007B900]
!*Yeah, he told us about your research. Memories. Ancestry. All that. He even asked if we'd be willing to come in and-

Id: [0x0007B901]
!*No! Jesus, no! What the hell is he doing?

Id: [0x0007B902]
!*Aileen. It's okay. We signed some papers... non-disclosure stuff.

Id: [0x0007B903]
!*No! He's trying to fuck me over. Dammit!

Id: [0x0007B904]
!*Aileen, we just talked about my mother. Just like you and I did. World War two. That's all.

Id: [0x0007B905]
!*It's the artifact.

Id: [0x0007B906]
!*The what?

Id: [0x0007B907]
!*Karl, if he calls again, you tell him you work through me, okay? That's it. Vidic has been a pain in my ass for years. And I don't need him getting all the glory for my two years of hard work.

Id: [0x0007B908]
!*All right. So... how should I go about this? I mean... the wheels are in motion.

Id: [0x0007B909]
!*I... I don't know. Just go through me if he contacts you again. Please.

Id: [0x0007B90A]
!*All right.

Id: [0x0007B90B]
!*You'll do that?

Id: [0x0007B90C]
!*Of course. Yes.

Id: [0x0007B90E]
!*Thank you Karl. I'm sorry I was short with you. I've just been... exhausted. That's all.

Id: [0x0007B90F]

!*I'm not sure I can keep this up, you know. This job is well below my skill level.

Id: [0x0007BFC2]
!*Yeah well your coffee is shit. You could use some practice.

Id: [0x0007BFC3]
!*Wh- What? No no no, I followed that recipe to the letter.

Id: [0x0007BFC4]
!*It's an art, Shaun. Not a science.

Id: [0x0007BFC7]
!*Till next time.[turns to Shaun] Take care Shaun.

Id: [0x0007BFC8]
!*Bye, bye... Yes, bye. Oh, and don't expect any more free coffee! [Beat, softly] Arrogant.

Id: [0x0007BFCA]
!*She's great isn't she?[scoffs]

Id: [0x0007BFCB]
!*Anyway, thanks. Have fun pirating.

Id: [0x0007BFCF]
!*Over here!

Id: [0x0007BFD0]
!*Are you ready? He's waiting for us.

Id: [0x0007BFDC]
!*Shouldn't be long.

Id: [0x0007BFDD]
!*If you need to use the toilets they're just here, on the right.

Id: [0x0007BFDE]
!*Might be a few newspapers laying around too.

Id: [0x0007BFDF]
!*Head to the right of Olivier's office. If the receptionist complains, act like you're using the toilets.

Id: [0x0007BFE2]
!*If we're low on toilet paper just give me a shout, okay?

Id: [0x0007BFEC]
!*Ok, this may be tricky. You need to move some sensitive data around.

Id: [0x0007BFED]
!*Be careful now. As the data moves, there are security programs constantly monitoring the data flow. You need to sneak past them or they will destroy your data and send it back home.

Id: [0x0007BFEF]
!*It works!

Id: [0x0007BFF0]
!*Aha...

Id: [0x0007BFF3]
!*I'm curious about this shareholders meeting though. How about you break into Olivier's office and see if you can find his schedule?

Id: [0x0007BFF4]
!*Oh, what? You don't like that idea? Well how about I blow the fucking whistle on you, hacker! I OWN YOU!

Id: [0x0007BFF6]
!*[Laughs quietly]What I mean is... I don't want to ruin your life. So do as I say.

Id: [0x0007BFF7]
!*Now, step over to the window.

Id: [0x0007BFFA]
!*Go to the window. NOW!

Id: [0x0007BFFB]
!*You want me to keep you locked in here forever? Until security finds you? Go to the window!

Id: [0x0007BFFC]
!*Did you know that Abstergo was run by Templars? Oh yes.

Id: [0x0007C000]
!*All right... either you walk through that door, or throw yourself off the terrace. Those are your options.

Id: [0x0007C004]
!*Oh, well done, kiddo!

Id: [0x0007C005]
!*Find his computer. Make it snappy.

Id: [0x0007C00C]
!*You sneaky bastard. A pirate through and through, aren't ya?

Id: [0x0007C00D]
!*Now get down to the lobby. There's a courier waiting.

Id: [0x0007C00E]
!*[Laughs]That's right... I've been planning this for a few hours.

Id: [0x0007C011]
!*Now, wait. The receptionist. Hold on. I'll try something.

Id: [0x0007C014]
!*[Muffled talking, i.e. Hello Olivier Garneau's office. Etc.]

Id: [0x0007C015]
!*[Muffled talking.]

Id: [0x0007C017]
!*As gullible as ever.

Id: [0x0007C019]
!*Now hurry down to the lobby. Before I remotely detonate your earpiece.[Laughs]

Id: [0x0007C022]
!*Did you uh, like the Allongé? I practiced.

Id: [0x0007C023]
!*I think you pulled it a little too long.

Id: [0x0007C024]
!*Oh come on! It's not encrypted code, for God's sake. It's just bloody coffee!

Id: [0x0007C026]
!*Ah, hurray. It's our old friend.

Id: [0x0007C027]
!*Hey there. I just got a call about picking up another transfer.

Id: [0x0007C028]
!*Aw. You said you were here to see me.

Id: [0x0007C029]
!*Yes, That IS one of the perks.[to the player] Let's see it.

Id: [0x0007C02C]
!*Hm. A conference in Chicago. Very nice.

Id: [0x0007C02E]
!*Thanks for this. We'll be in touch.

Id: [0x0007C02F]
!*Ciao, Rebecca.[Beat] Text me!

Id: [0x0007C030]
!*Stuff it, Hastings.

Id: [0x0007C032]
!*Well done, friend. Very well done.

Id: [0x0007C033]
!*Apologies for my temper tantrum there. You are with the good guys, I promise.

Id: [0x0007C034]
!*We'll keep you safe. Trust me.

Id: [0x0007C03B]
!*Rest assured, we will compensate you when the hacker is found.

Id: [0x0007C03C]
!*I can't wait to show the work we've done with your stuff. Take care.

Id: [0x0007C040]
!*Did you hear that? I think I just gave you Level 3 security clearance!

Id: [0x0007C044]
!*...there's no need for you to be down here by yourself, Miss Lemay. My team will handle the investigation.

Id: [0x0007C045]
!*But you need extra eyes on this thing, John. We don't even know when the hackers broke in. It could take weeks to go through this data.

Id: [0x0007C047]
!*Still too long. I can't keep my team locked up for a week.

Id: [0x0007C048]
!*Legally you CAN. It's what they signed up for. Even if they didn't read their contracts.

Id: [0x0007C049]
!*Yes, of course. I just hate the idea. [Beat] So what's the next step?

Id: [0x0007C04C]
!*My team is processing the data now. We'll start sifting through it tonight. Scout's honor.

Id: [0x0007C053]
!*All right, I ditched her at the coffee stand.

Id: [0x0007C055]
!*Find the server containing the network logs.

Id: [0x0007C056]
!*Since I have a record of each and every one of your hacks, we'll just search for the timestamps on those, and turn that data into something harmless.

Id: [0x0007C058]
!*Here we are! Beautiful. I'll update your communicator one more time. A little program I cooked up, just for this purpose.

Id: [0x0007C059]
!*There we go. I think that worked.

Id: [0x0007C05A]
!*Try it out.

Id: [0x0007C05E]
!*Make me whole again, my children. My instruments. Bring me forth to fulfill your purpose.

Id: [0x0007C05F]
!*TELL ME!

Id: [0x0007C060]
!*She should be here! Now! Living in that god damned head of yours!

Id: [0x0007C069]
!*[Laughs] I wish I could explain all this strangeness, but there isn't much time. The short of it is, you saw my beloved Juno. And for a brief moment I thought she might occupy this tender body of yours.

Id: [0x0007C06B]
!*But something went wrong. And now she's back out there. Adrift.

Id: [0x0007C06C]
!*They created your kind. Did you know that? Your people were tools to them. That’s all you have ever been. That's all you should ever be!

Id: [0x0007C08E]
!*After you! We have work to do!

Id: [0x0007C09C]
!*There you go.

Id: [0x0007C09D]
!*Nice.

Id: [0x0007C09E]
!*Not quite.

Id: [0x0007C09F]
!*I set up a database for any data you find. Just look for the "My Files" section in your communicator and you'll be redirected right away.

Id: [0x0007C0A9]
!*Voila! You now have level 2 security clearance. Not bad for your first few weeks.

Id: [0x0007C0AE]
!*We're looking for the Shareholder's meeting schedule. It's worth a lot of money to us.

Id: [0x0007C0B6]
!*Don't even think about ratting me out. My tracks are covered. Yours ain't.

Id: [0x0007C0B7]
!*Where the hell are you going? Get down to the lobby.

Id: [0x0007C0B8]
!*GO TO THE LOBBY! NOW!

Id: [0x0007C0B9]
!*Go on back to work. We'll be in touch.

Id: [0x0007C0FA]
!*That means you!

Id: [0x0007C0FB]
!*We do as the lady says. Focus on the Observatory.

Id: [0x0007C0FE]
!*I know this seems excessive, but with our high-level security clearance, we have an obligation to our shareholders.

Id: [0x0007C102]
!*I'd wipe these servers myself, but as the head of IT, I'd be a suspect. It has to be someone they've already locked up.

Id: [0x0007C104]
!*It's all very scary.

Id: [0x0007C107]
!*All right, Listen. I'm entering the server room now. When you see us leave, get in there.

Id: [0x0007C109]
!*One at most.

Id: [0x0007C10E]
!*I've marked the server for you, numbskull. Are you that dense?

Id: [0x0007C112]
!*Excellent. Now you can remotely hack the computer containing the log files.

Id: [0x0007C6A2]
!*Easy as that.

Id: [0x0007C6A3]
!*Hurry!

Id: [0x0007C6A4]
!*What's taking you so long?

Id: [0x0007C6A6]
!*I'm sorry for your Loss.

Id: [0x0007C6A7]
!*You are a Fighter, aye.[Pause] In Prison, I heard Stories of the infamous Anne Bonny and Mary Read, taking on the King's Navy together. Just the Pair of you.

Id: [0x0007C6A8]
!*[Sigh]It's all true. And we'd have won that Day if Jack and his Lads weren't passed out in the Hold from Drink.

Id: [0x0007C6A9]
!*Edward...

Id: [0x0007C6AA]
!*If I'd stayed in Prison, they'd have taken him from me.[Beat]But he'd now be alive.

Id: [0x0007C6AD]
!*Edward... everyone's gone, aren't they?[a pause] Mary. Rackham. Thatch. And all the Rest.[a pause] I miss them so, rough as they were.[Beat] Do you feel that too? All empty Inside, like.

Id: [0x0007C6AF]
!*I do.[Pause] Devil curse me, I do.

Id: [0x0007C6B4]
!*And yet, for all my Successes, his Majesty has seen fit to sack me! And call me Home to England.[He raises the glass to his lips] Brilliant! God bless the Fucker!

Id: [0x0007C6B6]
!*Therefore, Hooray! Hooray for the ignoble and ignorant Prigs who rule the World with Sticks up their Arses! Hooray!

Id: [0x0007C6B9]
!*I brought those Brutes in Nassau to Heel, by God. And this is the thanks I get? Unbelievable.

Id: [0x0007C6C9]
!*It was her experiment that made it possible for my rebirth as one of[he looks at his own hand]... these things.

Id: [0x0007C6CB]
!*Ah!

Id: [0x0007C6CC]
!*Get down on your back! Now!

Id: [0x0007C6CE]
!*He's got a gun!

Id: [0x0007C6D2]
!*He's bleeding fast.

Id: [0x0007C6D3]
!*Check the victim!

Id: [0x0007C6D6]
!*Are you okay? Can you hear me?

Id: [0x0007C6D8]
!*Hello? Talk to me! You're all right?

Id: [0x0007C6DC]
!*There you are. Thank God.

Id: [0x0007C6EA]
!*These men will discover... that Nothing is sacred, and everyone is committed...

Id: [0x0007C6EF]
!*Ahhh. And well... what now?

Id: [0x0007C6F0]
!*This summer, Abstergo Entertainment invites you aboard for the Adventure of a lifetime...

Id: [0x0007C6F3]
!*Talk you idiot. Look at the light.

Id: [0x0007C6F4]
!*Isn't that the battery? I think that's the battery. Hello? Hello?

Id: [0x0007C6F5]
!*Ah![clears throat] Sorry about this. My name is Shaun. And back there is, Rebecca, my... partner in crime.

Id: [0x0007C6F6]
!*Hello!

Id: [0x0007C6F7]
!*Bloody good work earlier. Honestly, I mean it. Delivering us all that data. It's really just too bad our man on the inside was such a... uh, how how how to put it, fanatic, fanatic is the best word, I suppose.

Id: [0x0007C6F8]
!*We take who we can get!

Id: [0x0007C6F9]
!*Exactly. Exactly. Well put. We saw in John an opportunity to burrow deeper into Abstergo's cloud servers, and I am not ashamed to say, we took it... uh, not realizing of course that he was enlisting you to help him. And to blame, should anything go wrong.

Id: [0x0007C6FA]
!*I suppose it all worked really nicely in the end. Most of it, anyway.

Id: [0x0007C6FB]
!*What Shaun really wants to say is... if you're up for more hacking, we are too. John gave you level 3 security clearance before he died. You should use it.

Id: [0x0007C6FC]
!*The Assassins don't have the resources to pay you like the Templars do. But we'll make it worth your while.

Id: [0x0007C6FD]
!*Ah, look, we should really cut it short, Bex. Twenty seconds.

Id: [0x0007C6FE]
!*Ah, right.... Good luck!

Id: [0x0007C6FF]
!*Cheers Mate. And top notch work, really top, give yourself a pat on the back. And... happy hacking.

Id: [0x0007C709]
!*So what keeps you pushing forward on this Path, eh? Wouldn't the Assassins be a finer fit to your Temperament? Wouldn't they share your Love for a less painful Liberty?

Id: [0x0007C70C]
!*You know nothing of me, Roberts. Nothing.

Id: [0x0007C721]
!*Go on, try it out.

Id: [0x0007C722]
!*Are you having trouble with your communicator?

Id: [0x0007C726]
!*Over here!

Id: [0x0007C727]
!*We are ready for you.

Id: [0x0007C728]
!*Have a look at your workstation.

Id: [0x0007C729]
!*It's all set-up for you.

Id: [0x0007C72D]
!*What's the problem? Log on!

Id: [0x0007C72E]
!*Something wrong?

Id: [0x0007C73E]
!*You've thought this Plan through?

Id: [0x0007C73F]
!*It's a very simple Idea... if you follow my Orders to the Letter.

Id: [0x0007C81B]
!*Here's my Prize!

Id: [0x0007C823]
!*So what do you think?

Id: [0x0007C824]
!*It'll take some getting used to.

Id: [0x0007C82C]
!*The second Attack this month. I should have moved this Village long ago.

Id: [0x0007C82E]
!*I brought all this upon you Years ago. But I will stand by you now.

Id: [0x0007C82F]
!*It will take more than a few Favours to call yourself a true Assassin, Edward.

Id: [0x0007C831]
!*One thing at a Time, Mate.

Id: [0x0007C838]
!*Hold! Stand your Ground!

Id: [0x0007C839]
!*Please, I've been shot! I need Aid.

Id: [0x0007C83C]

Id: [0x0007C852]
!*Is everything you do out of Spite, Edward?

Id: [0x0007C853]
!*It's not Spite that's driving me Mary. It's Courage!

Id: [0x0007C854]

Id: [0x0007C86D]
!*Aileen! Talk to me! Can you open your eyes? Oh God... oh God...

Id: [0x0007C870]
!*Doctor Aileen Bock has and always will be a friend and colleague. When I first learned of her unfortunate accident, I was shocked of course. To see any friend injured in such a way is deeply upsetting. And to further learn that her injuries were severe enough to force a premature conclusion to her brilliant career... well, I would not wish that fate on anyone. [Pause] But if... if there is any solace to be found in her accident, it may be this: that she was injured in service of her research... in service of work that she cherished most dearly.

Id: [0x0007C871]
!*And it is thanks to her... [Pause] it is due to her diligence, that some of the mysteries of genetic memory have been further illuminated. And while it is true that work on her project - the Surrogate Initiative, as she called it - has been temporarily halted, the copious amounts of work she has done over the past three years has been incredibly valuable... so, while her work has been suspended for the time being, her legacy will most certainly... live on. [Pause... Vidic laughs lightly... then sighs... then falls silent.]

Id: [0x0007C874]
!*Quiet, Joan! Quiet!

!*Quiet!

Id: [0x0007C878]
!*Why did you take it? Who made you take it!

Id: [0x0007C879]
!*I took it of my own free will. With no constraint: I prefer a man's dress to a woman's.

Id: [0x0007C87A]
!*You made an oath, Jeanne! You swore to never again dress as a man!

Id: [0x0007C87B]
!*I never meant to swear that I would not RESUME the practice.

Id: [0x0007C87C]
!*Why have you done so?

Id: [0x0007C87D]
!*Because it is more lawful and suitable for me to return to the practice of wearing a man's dress - being always among men - than to have a woman's dress. I have resumed it because a promise made to me has not been kept...

Id: [0x0007C882]
!*There you go.

Id: [0x0007C884]
!*Yeah, look... I don't care what it tastes like, mate. That is a bloody Cappuccino. That is the button I pressed.

Id: [0x0007C8D4]
!*Good. Try walking around.

Id: [0x0007C8D6]
!*A doctor came by. Said there wasn't anything to worry about. That the liquid in that syringe was far, far below a lethal dose.

Id: [0x0007C8D7]
!*I feel terrible about all this. About everything. All our evidence pointed to you... but it was John all along.

Id: [0x0007C8D8]

!*There we go. I uploaded it to your database. You can watch it here, or at your Animus.

Id: [0x0007C8DF]
!*I think you'll love it. It really captures the... the essence of the era.

Id: [0x0007C8E1]
!*So- Take care. And again... thank you.

Id: [0x0007C994]
!*[Pain Grunt]

Id: [0x0007D29C]
!*Leaving already?

Id: [0x0007D29D]
!*All right, Rackham. Back to Retirement.

!*Surrogate Initiative, Test Session 37. August 9th, 1981. Host, Aileen Bock. DNA Sample, SB1970.

Id: [0x0007D6AF]
!*Well, let me be the first to reassure you: this will not happen. I will NOT let them take this from me. From us. I will not let one death... of an undiagnosed epileptic, I should add... I will not let this destroy the decades of incredible research done by our predecessors, and the five years I have spent perfecting the Animus. There is still more work to be done. And countless rewards to be reaped. So... I wanted you to be the first to know... I have decided to volunteer myself as my second subject. I am convinced that the Animus is perfectly safe, provided I stay within the boundaries of my own ancestral bloodline. Next week I plan to prove this by staying a full FOUR hours in the Animus.

Id: [0x0007D6B0]
!*I would be grateful to you if you and your team would monitor my progress. And after this necessary but ridiculous proof of concept, I give you my word that I will work closely with you to solve your outstanding problems. Your Surrogate Initiative is a bold idea, and I do believe it is the future of the Animus project. But while we have the Animus itself, I do not want to waste precious opportunities to prove its safety. [beat] I’ll see you in the office on Monday. Goodbye.

Id: [0x0007D6C2]
!*Caroline, come away! Don't exert yourself.

Id: [0x0007D6C5]
!*The Jackdaw then.

Id: [0x0007D6C6]
!*Excellent!

Id: [0x0007D6CB]
!*Here's a quiet Spot. I'll see the Money.

Id: [0x0007D716]
!*Hands where I can see 'em, Lad!

Id: [0x0007D718]
!*Ah! Ah... Duncan?

Id: [0x0007D719]
!*Edward.

Id: [0x0007D71A]
!*Oh, Right. Edward... I thought you'd been shunted back to England.[beat] Without saying goodbye.

Id: [0x0007D71B]
!*Not exactly. I found some Trouble I couldn't fix. So I Thought it best to move on. So what's brought you to this rough shores?

Id: [0x0007D71C]
!*[Sigh]A failing Business, sadly. The Competition has toughened as of Late. And here one of the Beckfords' Men has just cut me out of a tidy Profit. Three Weeks sailing, and my Hands are empty.

Id: [0x0007D71D]
!*Beckfords... as in the Beckford sugar Plantation?

Id: [0x0007D71E]
!*Oh my... you've- got a natural way of authority, Edward. I wish I could say the same. I've since come to learn that the costume does not make the man. Not in the least.

Id: [0x0007D720]
!*You can't play it halfway, Stede. You go the distance, or you go nowhere.[Beat] That's your choice.

Id: [0x0007D733]
!*The very same. I think he's around. Haughty chap. Probably talking loudly about his gains as we speak.

Id: [0x0007D734]
!*Well, if he's still here, I'll see that he gets his comeuppance for treating you so ill.

Id: [0x0007D735]
!*Aye, in the midst of a Hurricane.

Id: [0x0007D736]
!*Just before the Treasure Fleet was smashed against the Shore.

Id: [0x0007D737]
!*Don't get squeamish, Kenway. Don't let 'em scare you!

Id: [0x0007D749]
!*What's our Course, Thatch?

Id: [0x0007D74A]
!*Bearing up, then. Sou-Sou-East.

Id: [0x0007D74E]
!*Was the Haul aboard as rich as Men are saying?

Id: [0x0007D752]
!*That's a comfort.

Id: [0x0007D758]
!*Easy as she goes. No telling what you may find out here.

Id: [0x0007D759]
!*Don't soil your Breeches, Lads. I got this.

Id: [0x0007D802]
!*You haven't earned these, but[Beat] they suit you.

Id: [0x0007D806]
!*I don't know, Jim. I haven't the faintest Idea how to pilot a Ship. That ain't work a Woman does.

Id: [0x0007D807]
!*Tosh! I've seen a Score of Ladies who can reef a Sail and spin a Capstan.

Id: [0x0007D808]
!*And would you teach me to fight? With a Cutlass, like? And maybe handle a Pistol?

Id: [0x0007D809]
!*All that and more. But you have to want it. And work for it. There's no stumbling into true Success.

Id: [0x0007D80A]
!*Oy! Lad! That's my Lass you're making Love to! You lay off or I'll cut ya!

Id: [0x0007D80C]
!*You have a bold Idea. But I must think it carefully through.

Id: [0x0007D80D]
!*[Hooting and Hollering.]

Id: [0x0007D80E]
!*Up your Arse, Rackham. Lad is the last thing you should be calling me.

Id: [0x0007D811]
!*A simple Pledge of Loyalty is all you need suggest to the House of Commons. An Oath, a Gesture, and a simple ceremonial Dram of Blood taken from the Finger. That's all.

Id: [0x0007D812]
!*The Ministers may give me Trouble, but it should be easy enough to convince the House of Lords. They do adore an Excess of Pomp and Circumstance.

Id: [0x0007D813]
!*Exactly.[Beat] Tell them it's a Show of Fealty to the King... against those revolting Jacobites.

Id: [0x0007D814]
!*The crucial Detail is the Blood. You must get a Sample from each Man. We want to be ready when we find the Observatory.

Id: [0x0007D81B]
!*The men Native to this Land will put up a fight, Edward. Are you willing to push back If necessary? To kill if needed?

Id: [0x0007D81C]
!*You'll hear from me soon.

Id: [0x0007D81F]
!*Well done.

Id: [0x0007D820]
!*Are we close, God dammit?

Id: [0x0007D823]
!*Innocent or no, they stand between us and our Object. Why sympathize beyond this Fact?

Id: [0x0007D824]
!*I didn't come to slaughter innocent Men, Roberts.

Id: [0x0007D827]
!*I had hoped to find you here. Well spotted, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007D828]
!*Is this the Observatory? All this?

Id: [0x0007D829]
!*...and the Door opens, after almost eighty-thousand Years.

Id: [0x0007D82C]
!*I can't take this no more! Jaysus, I can't!

Id: [0x0007D82E]
!*What the hell is all this! Oh God!

Id: [0x0007D82F]
!*Help!

Id: [0x0007D830]
!*God help me!

Id: [0x0007D831]
!*Ah!

Id: [0x0007D832]
!*Get me out of this place! Please!

Id: [0x0007D836]
!*Jaysus Roberts! Have you gone Mad?

Id: [0x0007D837]
!*But you, ah... I suspect you're made of sterner Stuff.

Id: [0x0007D83A]
!*Step as if on thin Ice, Captain.

Id: [0x0007D83F]
!*Look at this Place!

Id: [0x0007D840]
!*Beautiful, isn't it?

Id: [0x0007D841]
!*Aye. Like something out of a Fairy Tale, or one of them old Poems.

Id: [0x0007D842]
!*There were many Stories about this Place once. Tales that turned into Rumours, and again into Legend. The inevitable Process of Facts becoming Fictions, before fading away entirely.

Id: [0x0007D843]
!*The more you talk, Man, the less I understand.

Id: [0x0007D844]
!*I don't expect you to.

Id: [0x0007D845]
!*It may be again, one Day. But not in this Epoch.

Id: [0x0007D859]
!*I be needin' coin to set up the shipyard Cap'n. The faster I have the needful gold, the sooner our ships will rule the waves!

Id: [0x0007D868]
!*A curious Bunch.

Id: [0x0007D887]
!*Oh! Oh, is that right, is it? LAD!

Id: [0x0007D888]
!*Let's try another. Governor Woodes Rogers.

Id: [0x0007D889]
!*Yes. Indeed.

Id: [0x0007D88A]
!*Ah, these Templars.

Id: [0x0007D88B]
!*Agreed.

Id: [0x0007D88D]
!*[pain breath]Roberts!

Id: [0x0007D88E]
!*[pain breath]I'll gut you!

Id: [0x0007D88F]
!*[Pained scream]

Id: [0x0007D894]
!*How resourceful!

Id: [0x0007D895]
!*[Laugh]He fights as a Devil in Sailor's Rags!

Id: [0x0007D896]
!*Wonderful!

Id: [0x0007D897]
!*Mary was fond of you, Edward. She saw something in your Bearing that gave her Hope you might one Day fight with us.

Id: [0x0007D898]
!*Aye, she told me.

Id: [0x0007D899]
!*And what do you think of our Creed?

Id: [0x0007D89A]
!*It's hard to say. For if Nothing is true, then why believe Anything? And if Everything is permitted... why not chase every Desire?

Id: [0x0007D89B]
!*Why indeed?

Id: [0x0007D89C]
!*Here now. Arm yourself with this. The Sheng Biao... a gift from our Chinese Brothers and Sisters, one we now pass to you.

Id: [0x0007D905]
!*[Cheers]

Id: [0x0007D916]
!*Do you all hear that?

Id: [0x0007D922]
!*Where the hell is Kenway?

Id: [0x0007D923]
!*Note the day, lads! Today we send the King's finest to their graves!

Id: [0x0007D932]
!*I'll not play duck and drake with ye Cap'n, I need coin to build a little emporium. I'd be ever obliged... and a local shop would bring in many a useful ware for ye as repayment.

Id: [0x0007D94A]
!*It will be when he sends his Soldiers to scrub this Island clean of our Residue! Look around you, Man. Is this Cesspool worth dying for?

Id: [0x0007D94B]
!*Aye! It's our Republic! Our Idea! A free Land for free Men, Remember?

Id: [0x0007D995]
!*So maybe it's filthy to look at. But it ain't it still an Idea worth fighting for?

Id: [0x0007D998]
!*Aye, Nassau may look fine from a Distance, but at its Core there's a Disease I cannot Stomach.

Id: [0x0007D99A]
!*Sickness can be cured, Ben. If only you have the right Medicine.

Id: [0x0007D99B]
!*But a Corpse cannot be reanimated!

Id: [0x0007D99C]
!*I can't believe the Shite I'm hearing drop from your Lips! Why not take the Pardon now and be done with it!

Id: [0x0007D99D]
!*Peace! Both of you. We can satisfy both Aims if we work together. Find Medicines to ease our Burden's here, but in a Way that don't attract the British.

Id: [0x0007D99E]
!*The Spanish Fleet that sunk two years back would have some Medicine. All sealed up in glass Vials.

Id: [0x0007D99F]
!*You'd need a diving Bell to reach those Depths.

Id: [0x0007D9A0]
!*Aye. And with some Coin and a few Supplies, a Diving Bell won't be hard to come by.

Id: [0x0007D9A1]
!*This is a plan I can stand behind. Find Medicines without stirring up Trouble. Agreed, Thatch?

Id: [0x0007D9A2]
!*Agreed, aye. I'll meet you near the Wrecks as soon as you're able, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007DAB9]
!*We're Assassins and we follow a Creed, aye. But it does not command us to act or submit... only to be wise.

Id: [0x0007DABA]
!*Oh do tell. I'd love to hear it.

Id: [0x0007DABB]
!*"Nothing is true, Everything is permitted." This is the world's only Certainty.

Id: [0x0007DABE]
!*"Everything is permitted?" I like the Sound of that. Thinking what I like, and acting how I please.

Id: [0x0007DABF]
!*You parrot the Words... but you do not understand them.

Id: [0x0007DAC2]
!*Don't get haughty with me, Kidd. I followed you as a Friend, and you tricked me.

Id: [0x0007DAC3]
!*Well cheers for that.

Id: [0x0007DAC4]
!*Aye. Cheers.

Id: [0x0007DAC7]
!*Until you came along and mucked Things up, it was us chasing them. We had them running scared. But they have the upper Hand now.

Id: [0x0007DACE]
!*It might be that this Idea is only the beginning of Wisdom, and not its final Form.

Id: [0x0007DACF]
!*That's quite a step up from the Edward I met here many Years ago.

Id: [0x0007DAD7]
!*[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x0007DADA]
!*[Laugh]Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007DADE]
!*It may be he remembers where he's hid his Coin before my Aim markedly improves!

Id: [0x0007DAE0]
!*[Laughing.]

Id: [0x0007DAE3]
!*I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x0007DAE7]
!*Let's Uncork that poor fella some Breakfast, eh?

Id: [0x0007DAED]
!*We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x0007DAEF]
!*[Laughs]It's not the first time Kenway and it won't be the last.

Id: [0x0007DAF2]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x0007DAF9]
!*[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007DAFA]
!*[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007DAFB]
!*[Sound of effort, hunting]

Id: [0x0007DAFD]
!*That's gonna hurt.

!*Yurrhhh...

Id: [0x0007DB1A]
!*I'm going to be Sick!

Id: [0x0007DB1B]
!*The Smell!

Id: [0x0007DB1E]
!*The whole thing! Says who?

Id: [0x0007DB1F]
!*Alvin. He showed me the bill of sale. Earned enough for the month, in a single day! And he'll do it again tomorrow when he delivers it to their Headquarters.

Id: [0x0007DB2C]
!*Get out of Sight.

Id: [0x0007DB2D]
!*Conceal yourself.

Id: [0x0007DB2F]
!*Hurry! Keep after him!

Id: [0x0007DB30]
!*Don't let him get away!

Id: [0x0007DB31]
!*Don't sink him!

Id: [0x0007DB32]
!*We need the Man and the Ship intact.

Id: [0x0007DB33]
!*If he drowns we'll lose Marquez!

Id: [0x0007DB35]
!*We've got him! Board his ship!

Id: [0x0007DB36]
!*Board him, and make him talk!

Id: [0x0007DB37]
!*What are you waiting for? Board it!

Id: [0x0007DB39]
!*Keep the Target alive! Don't let him see you.

Id: [0x0007DB3A]
!*The Target's no good to us dead!

Id: [0x0007DB3B]
!*My enemies! Help me fight them.

Id: [0x0007DB3C]
!*Look up!

Id: [0x0007DB3D]
!*Behind you!

Id: [0x0007DB3E]
!*Help me!

Id: [0x0007DB3F]
!*Use a Powder Keg!

Id: [0x0007DB4B]
!*Is it your Aim to destroy the last of my Kind? Here I am. Come get me.

Id: [0x0007DBC4]
!*I've got more than enough Powder to take care of them.

Id: [0x0007DBC5]
!*Use a Keg.

Id: [0x0007DBC6]
!*Set the Keg where they'll least expect it.

Id: [0x0007DBC7]
!*Suprise them with a Powder Keg.

Id: [0x0007DBC8]
!*Take a Keg. Set a Trap.

Id: [0x0007DBC9]
!*Set a trap with Powder Kegs!

Id: [0x0007DBCC]
!*Fire at the Powder Keg!

Id: [0x0007DC1E]

Id: [0x0007DCC2]
!*Bless you, Lads.

Id: [0x0007DD37]
!*I don't believe you.

Id: [0x0007DD38]
!*Go ask down at the Piers. He's the talk of the town.

Id: [0x0007DD3A]
!*Your whole Catch? You must have made a Fortune.

Id: [0x0007DD3B]
!*You see! Alvin is practically Nobility now!

Id: [0x0007DD3C]
!*Ah! A noble Fisherman. Indeed.

Id: [0x0007DD3D]
!*We're coming with you.

Id: [0x0007DD3E]
!*More are coming. Take them out. Corner her. Make her fight alone.

Id: [0x0007DD3F]
!*Lucia, come. Don't keep us waiting.

Id: [0x0007DD40]
!*You cannot hide forever.

Id: [0x0007DD41]
!*Confront us now, confront us later; there is no escaping either way!

Id: [0x0007DD42]
!*We're right here Lucia. Waiting for you. Come out!

Id: [0x0007DD43]
!*They'll come from the Back.

Id: [0x0007DD44]
!*They're coming from the Left.

Id: [0x0007DD45]
!*Cover the Right Entrance.

Id: [0x0007DD46]
!*Look up!

Id: [0x0007DD47]
!*Those big guys are slow, but deadly. Powder will take Care of them.

Id: [0x0007DD48]
!*Use the Powder Barrels on those Brutes.

Id: [0x0007DD49]
!*Those brutes are tough, but they're no Match for a Powder Barrel.

Id: [0x0007DD4A]
!*Keep away from those Brutes if you can. Let the Powder Barrels take Care of them.

Id: [0x0007DD4C]
!*They're coming from the Rooftops!

Id: [0x0007DD4D]
!*I'm hit!

Id: [0x0007DD4E]
!*[cry of agony]

Id: [0x0007DD4F]
!*A little Help, please!

Id: [0x0007DD50]
!*Take out the Rooftop Guards first.

Id: [0x0007DD53]
!*Any man's Senses can be tuned well past what he's born with. If he tries.

Id: [0x0007DD5C]
!*Make sure he doesn't ring for Reinforcements.

Id: [0x0007DD5D]
!*Let's use their own Powder Kegs against them!

Id: [0x0007DD5E]
!*Let's fight Fire with Fire!

Id: [0x0007DDB8]
!*A Shimmering.

Id: [0x0007DDBB]
!*Go on, Man. Focus!

Id: [0x0007DDBC]
!*Look through the Darkness.

Id: [0x0007DDBF]
!*Ah! Right. I know this Feeling. I have since I was a Lad.

Id: [0x0007DDC0]
!*It's like using every Sense at once, isn't it? To see Sounds and hear Shapes. Quite a Combination.

Id: [0x0007DE21]
!*You've ruined me, Bastard!

Id: [0x0007DE28]
!*Damn you, Man! Relent, and and you'll have a Handsome reward!

Id: [0x0007DE29]
!*You think I could trust a posh Dab like you. The man who murdered my Captain and drowned my crew?

Id: [0x0007DE2C]
!*[Death cry, quick]

Id: [0x0007DE2E]
!*IF I must die, I'm taking you with me!

Id: [0x0007DEE5]
!*Hah! Not much of a Shot, are you, Flint?

Id: [0x0007DEE6]
!*[laughter] I should, after studying you for so long.

Id: [0x0007DEE7]
!*Then you finally admit your Obsession with me!

Id: [0x0007DEE8]
!*And how many Men have you sent after me, just this week, Flint?

Id: [0x0007DEE9]
!*What did you expect? That I would come in Person? You overestimate your Importance.

Id: [0x0007DF13]
!*You're a Pig, Flint.

Id: [0x0007DF14]
!*Oh... don't be stroppy, Dinsmore.

Id: [0x0007DF1B]
!*Oh, you make me Ill.

Id: [0x0007DF1C]
!*Ah, that's right Flint, retreat! I like a Man who knows his Place.

Id: [0x0007DF1D]
!*Is that what you tell all the Lads at the Punch House?

Id: [0x0007DF1E]

Id: [0x0007E659]

!*Captain. You have the Look of a man crafting a bold Idea. A Look I've seen before.

Id: [0x0007E669]
!*You mark well, Adé. I've just overheard one of the Beckford Men talking grandly about his Plantation, and all the Cargo he's keeping there.

Id: [0x0007E66A]
!*And it gave me the Idea that I might take these Goods off him, and sell them off for a better Price than he'd ever Ask.

Id: [0x0007E683]
!*[laughs]Ah! A man of Vision. I like this Idea.

Id: [0x0007E686]
!*This Man's working for Peter Beckford's People. Do you know them? The Beckfords and their Sugar Empire?

Id: [0x0007E687]
!*Aye. The Beckfords and the Draxes. I never worked their Plantations, but I knew their Names from hearing other Men curse them.

Id: [0x0007E688]
!*But you worked a Plantation, no?

Id: [0x0007E689]
!*A modest One, aye. As a Striker in the boiling House.

Id: [0x0007E68A]
!*Boiling House? Was it Water they boiled? Or something Else?

Id: [0x0007E68B]
!*Cane Juices. It's a hard Process making Sugar. Dangerous too. Must be why it fetches such a dear Price.

Id: [0x0007E68C]
!*What's it like toiling on a Plantation, Day and Night?

Id: [0x0007E68D]
!*Well, with the cane Sugar cut and harvested, it's run between two Metal Rollers that crush the Juice from the Plant.

Id: [0x0007E68E]
!*Often it would happen that a Man got his Arm trapped in a Roller, and crushed it to the thinness of a Crepe.

Id: [0x0007E68F]

Id: [0x0007E690]
!*Jaysus.

Id: [0x0007E691]
!*After collecting the Juice, it was time to boil away the Waters from the Sugar. This we did in Taches made of Copper.

Id: [0x0007E692]
!*And let me tell you, Breddah. Boiling Sugar is near the hottest Thing on Earth. Just a Touch on the Skin will stick like Birdlime and burn on, leaving a terrible Scar.

Id: [0x0007E693]
!*I had Friends lose Eyes, and Fingers, and Arms working the boiling House. And as Slaves, believe that we never heard a Word of Praise nor an Apology of any Kind.

Id: [0x0007E696]
!*Hold, Adé. There's Trouble Afore.

Id: [0x0007E697]
!*I see them.

Id: [0x0007E698]

Id: [0x0007E6A5]
!*We'll soon see, won't we? For you must double the Watch this Evening.

Id: [0x0007E6A6]
!*Double, Sir? Whatever for?

Id: [0x0007E6A7]
!*I believe I was followed here, young Man. By Pirates if my Eyes honour me, though the Ship was uncommonly large for such Rascals.

Id: [0x0007E6A8]
!*Certainly wasn't Slavers, though. Not a Ship that size.

Id: [0x0007E6A9]

Id: [0x0007EABC]
!*Pierre handed in his notice this morning. This new security measure is freaking people out.

Id: [0x0007EABD]
!*They won't let him go. It's part of our contract. Having ultra-high security clearance means you have to go through a whole debriefing process. It takes months.

Id: [0x0007EAC0]
!*What’s with all these security notices I'm seeing lately?

Id: [0x0007EAC1]
!*Just a standard message we use on occasion. Nothing to worry about. We've just had some issues around the office lately.

Id: [0x0007EAC4]
!*Hey thanks for sharing the White Whale data with me. I was able to track it down myself.

Id: [0x0007EAC5]
!*No problem, man. It's amazing, right?

Id: [0x0007EAF8]
!*The body has been moved?

Id: [0x0007EAFC]
!*So you managed everything ok?

Id: [0x0007EAFD]
!*Yeah thanks for that – it was a big help.

Id: [0x0007EB00]
!*Marco! Missed you at the Lumiere festival last night.

Id: [0x0007EC5E]
!*Really? I had no idea.

Id: [0x0007EC5F]
!*Read the fine print man. Working for Abstergo has its benefits, but there are some drawbacks too. Big ones.

Id: [0x0007EC60]
!*Like, server security issues? Because these notices seem pretty severe. Like, draconian actually.

Id: [0x0007EC61]
!*No, no. It's nothing to worry about, really. Walk with me and I'll explain.

Id: [0x0007EC72]
!*Yeah, I tracked it down as soon as I saw your message. Followed it for a while... couldn't catch it though.

Id: [0x0007EC74]
!*So did Edward really meet all those pirates? The famous ones?

Id: [0x0007EC75]
!*Yes, he did. Blackbeard, Calico Jack, Anne Bonny, Mary Read, Bartholomew Roberts.

Id: [0x0007EC76]
!*Crazy. Nassau must have been a wild place.

Id: [0x0007EC77]
!*For a while, yeah. But not after... well. I don't want to spoil it.

Id: [0x0007EC78]
!*And they pay out bonuses too. Inconvenience Pay, they call it.

Id: [0x0007EC79]
!*Really? That's actually kind of nice.

Id: [0x0007EC7B]
!*Yeah... yeah, he was killed... shot in the chest multiple times... no, no that shouldn't be a problem... we collected more than enough data-- we'll know soon enough... mm-hm, mm-hm... all right... All right I can send you the results as soon as possible... Okay... any word on Olivier... dammit... God I'm worried sick... yeah... all right... thanks Laetitia... bye.

Id: [0x0007EC7C]
!*Yes sir. And preserved. We'll do what we can.

Id: [0x0007EC7D]
!*Good. Let’s keep security units on standby. I know Miss Lemay said the situation was under control, but I have a feeling we may be needing them again soon.

Id: [0x0007EC7F]
!*No problem – I remember the first time I did this for more than an hour. I had similar kinds of effects from the Animus. [Beat] Just if it happens again have a word with Melanie and see if it needs checking out.

Id: [0x0007EC80]
!*OK.

Id: [0x0007EC81]
!*We did? When?

Id: [0x0007EC82]
!*At Nouveau Palais. We shared a booth before taking a Taxi downtown. You don't remember? You kept talking about how damn cold it was.

Id: [0x0007EC83]
!*Shit. Eliane brought Mezcal to dinner. I don't remember much after dessert.[beat] How was the show?

Id: [0x0007EC84]

Id: [0x0007EC85]
!*That's good.

Id: [0x0007EC86]
!*I’m glad that’s over. I hate it when they escalate the security. Makes me jumpy.

Id: [0x0007EC87]
!*Did they put anyone in the bunker this time?

Id: [0x0007EC88]
!*Just for a few days, I think. It sucks, but... I suppose it's necessary? We deal with some really sensitive data.

Id: [0x0007EC89]
!*Classified shit, yeah. I don't know how I feel about it but... It's in our contracts, so...

Id: [0x0007ECE6]
!*[FR][Evidemment, si je la vois, je lui dirai que tu as appelé.](Of course if I find her I’ll let her know you called.)

!*Look, I saw the official statement. They're claiming it was a heart attack. So that's that.

Id: [0x0007ECF9]
!*But you saw the guy’s wrist, didn't you? There was a cross! Don't tell me that's just a coincidence.

Id: [0x0007ECFA]
!*Officially, yes. It's a coincidence. End of story.

Id: [0x0007ECFB]
!*Officially...[FR][Merde.](shit.) And what about Unofficially.

Id: [0x0007ECFC]
!*Unofficially... I don't know. I want to believe the best, but I always fear the worst.[Beat] Now stop sticking your nose where it doesn't belong.

Id: [0x0007ED46]
!*Looks to me like a Crew of Pirates here.

Id: [0x0007ED47]
!*Aye. Mixing with these Heathens. Makes me bloody sick.

Id: [0x0007ED49]
!*Who's this Dutch fella we brought here? What a Sourpuss, he is.

Id: [0x0007ED4A]
!*A Slaver named Prins. I'm told he has a Letter of Marque from Governor Hamilton. And that we're to afford him every Courtesy.

Id: [0x0007ED4B]
!*That's a queer Combination.

Id: [0x0007ED4C]
!*Look, all I know is he's looking for Someone. And we're to help him find it.

Id: [0x0007ED4D]
!*Gah! Carting old Misers around ain't what I signed up for.

Id: [0x0007ED4E]

Id: [0x0007ED50]
!*God's Truth, I can't fathom why.

Id: [0x0007ED51]
!*Can't handle living among Men, can they. Can't handle the Christian life. So they come here.

Id: [0x0007ED53]
!*You seen this Temple here? It's massive.

Id: [0x0007ED54]
!*Aye. I'm wondering if it's full of Gold and Jade and the Like.

Id: [0x0007ED59]
!*Has to be, don't it? Where else would the Dagos get it?

Id: [0x0007ED5A]
!*Pulling it out of the Ground, ain't they?

Id: [0x0007ED5B]
!*Somewhat. The Path winds further still, beset by more unruly Men. Go...

Id: [0x0007ED5D]
!*See about catching that One, Captain! We're too far along to have our Plans disrupted by an Idiot.

Id: [0x0007ED5E]

!*An off Day, Duncan?

Id: [0x0007EEAF]

Id: [0x0007EEB4]
!*I don't like this Route, Torres. We're exposed.

!*How long do we have to stay here?

Id: [0x0007F078]
!*Until we find the artifact.

Id: [0x0007F079]

!*How valuable is this thing anyway?

Id: [0x0007F07C]
!*Dunno.

Id: [0x0007F07D]
!*Well what does it do, then?

Id: [0x0007F07E]
!*They wouldn't say.

Id: [0x0007F080]
!*I bet the artifact ain't even here. I bet she has it on her somewhere.

Id: [0x0007F081]
!*That's why I'm not even looking for it. They'll find it soon enough.

Id: [0x0007F082]
!*It's so boring here. I wish there was more to do.

Id: [0x0007F083]
!*Tell me about it.

Id: [0x0007F090]
!*Any news from the men who went after her?

Id: [0x0007F091]

Id: [0x0007F092]

!*I'll say.

!*Decided to move in, did they?

Id: [0x0007F098]
!*Least until they find that artifact.

Id: [0x0007F09A]
!*Big operation for a small artifact.

Id: [0x0007F09B]
!*Why didn't they choose us to go find it, do you think?

Id: [0x0007F09C]
!*[laughs] Boy, that job's no promotion! You really fancy sleeping in a tent, digging around all day in the dirt after nothing?

Id: [0x0007F09D]
!*Why nothing? The man who finds it is sure to be rewarded.

Id: [0x0007F09E]

!*Damn these Cutthroats! So well prepared.

Id: [0x0007F0AD]
!*As are we, Grand Master. Stay calm.

Id: [0x0007F0B0]
!*Here's another Attack!

Id: [0x0007F0B1]
!*Gather in!

Id: [0x0007F0B4]
!*[SP][¡Preparaos para partir! ¡Casi tenemos encima la tormenta!](Make ready to leave! That Storm's nearly upon us!)

Id: [0x0007F0B5]
!*[SP][¿Y qué pasa con los prisioneros?](What of the Prisoners?)

Id: [0x0007F0B6]
!*[SP][Que se ahoguen; ¡mejor ellos que nosotros!](Let them drown, else we all do!)

Id: [0x0007F0B8]
!*[SP][¡Los prisioneros han escapado!](The Prisoners have escaped!)

Id: [0x0007F0B9]
!*[SP][¡Alto ahí, maldita sea!](Stop right there, damn you!)

Id: [0x0007F0BA]
!*[Surprised in scream]Aieee!

Id: [0x0007F0C0]
!*I miss the sun.

Id: [0x0007F0C1]
!*Don't even know what time it is. Is it almost dinner yet?

Id: [0x0007F0C2]
!*We expecting many more of these?

Id: [0x0007F0C3]
!*I miss the sun.

Id: [0x0007F0C4]
!*Do you think the men who went to the camp are eating better than we are?

Id: [0x0007F0C5]
!*Don't care as long as we're paid the same.

Id: [0x0007F0CA]
!*We've saved all the Men we can, Breddah. And it's enough to form a Crew.

Id: [0x0007F0CB]
!*All we're lack now is a Ship of our own!

Id: [0x0007F13C]
!*These shadows! I'm seeing things.

Id: [0x0007F13D]
!*So you're seeing things. Who cares? Pull yourself together.

Id: [0x0007F13E]
!*It's like a shadow theatre in here. I hate the theatre.

Id: [0x0007F140]
!*I thought I'd see more excitement, posted to a fort.

Id: [0x0007F141]
!*Excitement? You want another war? For what?

Id: [0x0007F142]
!*[Sigh]Who is that man in black? I heard he was giving bribes.

Id: [0x0007F143]
!*Why am I never on duty the days that bribes are offered?

Id: [0x0007F145]
!*When they return, they owe us a pint.

Id: [0x0007F155]
!*That girl, in the prison. Who is she?

Id: [0x0007F156]
!*They say she lead a revolt, but I don't believe it.

Id: [0x0007F157]
!*That slave girl, in the prison-- why are they keeping her?

Id: [0x0007F158]
!*I don't know why they don't just punish the girl or send her back to her master. Why keep her here?

Id: [0x0007F186]
!*Help! Help!

Id: [0x0007F187]
!*Prisoner on the loose!

Id: [0x0007F188]
!*Stop her!

Id: [0x0007F189]
!*Catch her!

Id: [0x0007F18A]
!*Stop her!

Id: [0x0007F18B]
!*To the prison!

Id: [0x0007F19A]
!*Intruder!

Id: [0x0007F19B]
!*We've been breached!

Id: [0x0007F19C]
!*Stop her!

Id: [0x0007F19D]
!*Stop! Intruder!

Id: [0x0007F19E]
!*Ring the alarms!

Id: [0x0007F19F]
!*All men to your stations!

Id: [0x0007F22B]
!*He did not have so many witnesses as we do in Nassau. Trust me. He is doing it now.

Id: [0x0007F22C]
!*Right this moment?

Id: [0x0007F22D]
!*Nothing can save him now.

Id: [0x0007F22F]
!*Not over there.

Id: [0x0007F230]
!*Work with me, mate.

Id: [0x0007F231]
!*Turn around.

Id: [0x0007F232]
!*Not that way!

Id: [0x0007F233]
!*No!

Id: [0x0007F234]
!*That's it!

Id: [0x0007F235]
!*Yes, towards me.

Id: [0x0007F236]
!*There's trouble over there.

Id: [0x0007F237]
!*Just go as straight as you can.

Id: [0x0007F239]
!*[belch]

Id: [0x0007F23A]
!*[small burp]

Id: [0x0007F23B]
!*[alphabet burp? other creative burp?]

Id: [0x0007F23C]
!*I don't feel so good.

Id: [0x0007F23E]
!*This way.

Id: [0x0007F23F]
!*[big burp]

Id: [0x0007F240]
!*Who the hell are you?

Id: [0x0007F241]
!*Mate, I think I drank too much.

Id: [0x0007F339]
!*Fair enough.

Id: [0x0007F33D]
!*What do you mean? What are you implying?

Id: [0x0007F33E]
!*I am not implying; I am merely asking: Do you really imagine Jing as the lady of the house? Mistress of servants, brood mother?

Id: [0x0007F33F]
!*Why should I not imagine it. Do you question her love? Her fitness?

Id: [0x0007F340]
!*Of course not. But knowing her as you do, you must appreciate that she is a woman of action. She needs the sea, a challenge. How will she adapt to a quiet, domestic life.

Id: [0x0007F341]
!*I only worry for your safety, brother.

Id: [0x0007F342]
!*You always had to be the favored child, the golden boy. You can't stand it that she would give her heart to me, when she can't even give you a second glance! So you hate her!

Id: [0x0007F343]
!*I have no hate. Only concern.

Id: [0x0007F351]
!*And I'll bring my Ship closer, shall I? We'll rescue my Sugar yet!

Id: [0x0007F353]
!*Good Morning, Duncan. Just over here...

Id: [0x0007F356]
!*Edward! Hello, Edward!

Id: [0x0007F359]
!*I found a Man to purchase my remaining Sugar![Beat] Quite a Coup, I must say!

Id: [0x0007F35A]
!*He just called you Edward.

Id: [0x0007F35B]
!*Oh, that's the Merchant who sailed me here. Out of Caution, I gave him a false Name.

Id: [0x0007F35C]
!*Ah... well done.

Id: [0x0007F35E]
!*We'll catch up, Bonnet! Later.

Id: [0x0007F3CC]
!*Let's make some Headway, shall we?

Id: [0x0007F3CD]
!*Find us a Schooner with that Spyglass, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007F3D0]
!*Take out your Glass, Kenway. Schooners are too small to peep with a naked Eye.

Id: [0x0007F3D1]
!*Are you trifling with me, Lad? Take out your Spyglass.

Id: [0x0007F3D2]
!*You won't find Nothing squinting into the Sun like that. Use your Glass.

Id: [0x0007F3F1]
!*After you subdue a Prize, project Authority and demand Respect that you would never give yourself. This weaves a Spell over soft Minds.

Id: [0x0007F3F2]
!*Your Victims must feel blessed to be in your presence. But never let them feel they have found a Friend in you.

Id: [0x0007F3F3]
!*For your Victims must always have in the Back of their Minds the uneasy Idea that you could snap at any Moment, and unseam them from Prick to Sternum.

Id: [0x0007F3F4]
!*In other Words, be a Gentleman ... until one of them is not.

Id: [0x0007F415]
!*You'll get yourself a Glimpse of what sort of Cargo they're shipping, and a general Idea of their Toughness.

Id: [0x0007F416]
!*There's a Prize worth taking!

Id: [0x0007F419]
!*Fire what Cannons you will, and land a few Strikes if you must. But for God's Sake don't sink her.

Id: [0x0007F41A]
!*It's no fun fishing Cargo out of the Sea. Although it can be done.

Id: [0x0007F41D]
!*You've scuffed her up Nice! Only don't put a hole below her Waterline.

Id: [0x0007F41E]
!*Careful now. You're doing heavy Damage.

Id: [0x0007F421]
!*Ho ho! She's dead in the Water! Steer up along side her.

Id: [0x0007F422]
!*Ease in close. We'll ready the Grapnels.

Id: [0x0007F423]
!*Lay up alongside her.

Id: [0x0007F426]
!*I'll lead the Party aboard for this one, Kenway. You watch and learn....

Id: [0x0007F4A6]
!*Blast! This is getting well out of Hand.

Id: [0x0007F4A7]
!*A dozen Crates of Medicine should not be so hard to come by.

Id: [0x0007F4A8]
!*That ain't my Meaning. It's Thatch and Hornigold and this pointless Feud of theirs. Can't you feel it?

Id: [0x0007F4A9]
!*I do, aye. But both Men have their Hearts in a good Place.

Id: [0x0007F4AA]
!*Both want the Best for the People of Nassau.

Id: [0x0007F4AB]
!*But is that the best Course for us? Saving a City that ain't worth much? We're not Men made to Govern. We take and spend, and live heartily... wherever we go.

Id: [0x0007F4AC]
!*What Solution would you propose?

Id: [0x0007F4AD]
!*The answer's in Wealth and Power, not Politics. If we found the Observatory, we'd see enough Money to buy the whole of England.

Id: [0x0007F4AE]
!*Or it might be... we'd lord over these Kings and Emperors like they was Peasants themselves.

Id: [0x0007F4AF]
!*A lot of large Talk, Captain. But is it your Crew you sail for... or yourself?

Id: [0x0007F4B0]
!*I mean the Best for these Men, Adé. I do. But this don't sit right. I feel like I'm running Errands, not living my Life.

Id: [0x0007F4EC]
!*Piss off, Ben!

Id: [0x0007F4EF]
!*Saw you chewing the Fat with Hornigold and Thatch. Rather heated, it seems.

Id: [0x0007F4F0]
!*Nah. Not so bad as that. We're only dreaming up Remedies for Keeping Nassau in tip-top Shape.

Id: [0x0007F4F1]
!*Use that to dive for Coin and assorted Sundries, and she'll pay herself off in no Time at all.

Id: [0x0007F815]
!*Is someone in here with us?

Id: [0x0007F816]
!*It's possible. We're trespassing.

Id: [0x0007F819]
!*Kenway! You all right?

Id: [0x0007F81A]
!*Nothing needs mending. I'll find a Way up!

Id: [0x0007F81C]
!*It's clear Someone's watching us.

Id: [0x0007F81D]
!*I don't doubt it.

Id: [0x0007F81E]
!*The way forward's blocked.

Id: [0x0007F81F]
!*That's a Door, I reckon.

Id: [0x0007F820]
!*Aye. And there should be some Way to open it. A Mechanism somewhere...

Id: [0x0007F821]
!*Like a Capstan?

Id: [0x0007F822]
!*Hm. Those Blocks up there. Try moving them.

Id: [0x0007F825]
!*Those Blocks up there seem like they might move with a bit of Weight.

Id: [0x0007F826]
!*Edward, get up there and add your Weight to one of those Blocks.

Id: [0x0007F827]
!*[Shocked yell] Ah!

Id: [0x0007F828]
!*Ah! Dammit!

Id: [0x0007F829]
!*Easy, Kenway. This ain't like climbing Ratlines.

Id: [0x0007F82A]
!*[Gruff grumble]

Id: [0x0007F834]
!*Step lightly...

Id: [0x0007F83B]
!*Easy now. Haven't had much luck with these old Walkways.

Id: [0x0007F83C]
!*Ain't there an easier Way?

Id: [0x0007F83E]
!*Jaysus!

Id: [0x0007F83F]
!*Jim! I'm here.

Id: [0x0007F840]
!*Hang on, Man. I'm catching up.

Id: [0x0007F841]
!*But that wasn't you just ahead?

Id: [0x0007F842]
!*No, I been trailing you. What did you see?

Id: [0x0007F843]
!*I can't be sure.

Id: [0x0007F844]
!*[Effort Grunt while getting up]

Id: [0x0007F845]
!*[SP][Sí. De ese mercader de Barbados.](Aye. Taken from that Barbadian Merchant.)

Id: [0x0007F846]
!*Use Something else to see your way up here. We're getting close.

Id: [0x0007F847]
!*[Annoyed grunt]

Id: [0x0007F84A]
!*Only it's Something to do with this Water as well.

Id: [0x0007F84D]
!*Whatever is waiting at the End of this Path had better be worth my Time.

Id: [0x0007F84E]
!*That'll depend on you.

Id: [0x0007F84F]
!*How's that?

Id: [0x0007F850]
!*What I'm taking you to see may spin your Head right 'round. I only hope you can take the Shock of it.

Id: [0x0007F851]
!*I can handle myself.

Id: [0x0007F853]
!*Hint 1

Id: [0x0007F854]
!*Hint 2

Id: [0x0007F855]
!*Hint 3

Id: [0x0007F857]
!*We'll try this, right? I'll stand here, and you clamber over to that one there.

Id: [0x0007F858]
!*I might be able to make this Jump then. And open that Door.

Id: [0x0007F85A]
!*It's moving now. Hop on.

Id: [0x0007F85B]
!*Damn, this Thing won't budge! Lend us a Hand.

Id: [0x0007F85D]
!*What's the hold up? Jump up there, Man.

Id: [0x0007F85E]
!*Move it, Kenway. I'm not up here for my Health.

Id: [0x0007F85F]
!*Work your way on to that Statue, Man. Hurry.

Id: [0x0007F861]
!*You still drawing Breath?

Id: [0x0007F862]
!*Enough to curse you with, Kidd!

Id: [0x0007F863]
!*Our Friends are back to pester us.

Id: [0x0007F864]
!*They live in these Jungles. And they don't fancy us stomping about here. Avoid them if you can.

Id: [0x0007F866]
!*Can't you Assassins keep them in Line?

Id: [0x0007F867]
!*That's not how we work. We honour their Presence, even as they disagree with ours.

Id: [0x0007F869]
!*Leave this Life for a lasting Peace, down among the Dead.

Id: [0x0007F86B]
!*A great Shame it came to this. They were only protecting their Heritage.

Id: [0x0007F86C]
!*Must be a great treasure Beyond.

Id: [0x0007F86D]
!*Treasure. Right.

Id: [0x0007F86E]
!*Is this IT then? The grand Prize your Mentor asked me to see?

Id: [0x0007F86F]
!*Looks nothing like the Man they called the Sage, I'm sorry to say.

Id: [0x0007F870]
!*Keep your Trousers tied up. We've one more Riddle to solve.

Id: [0x0007F872]
!*These Statues are like the ones we've seen before, but with Pictures carved on them.

Id: [0x0007F873]
!*There's Pictures carved on the floor as well, but not of the same Sort.

Id: [0x0007F874]
!*There's a Correspondence then. But what...?

Id: [0x0007F876]
!*There a Difference between them Animals on the statues and them on the floor. Do you see it?

Id: [0x0007F877]
!*Aye. One group is Predators, the other is Prey.

Id: [0x0007F879]
!*Which Predator goes with which Prey, that's the Question.

Id: [0x0007F87A]
!*Right. There's your Correspondence. Match a Predator with its Prey.

Id: [0x0007F87C]
!*Seems that's not the right Position.

Id: [0x0007F87D]
!*I know, I know.

Id: [0x0007F87F]
!*Might be you can use the Lever to move them Drawings on the Ground.

Id: [0x0007F880]
!*I was just about to say the same.

Id: [0x0007F881]
!*Lend me a Hand here, will ya?

Id: [0x0007F883]
!*This isn't the right Position.

Id: [0x0007F885]
!*Heyo! That's a Match!

Id: [0x0007F886]
!*[A last dying breath]

Id: [0x0007F887]
!*[Effort Grunt while taking key]

Id: [0x0007F888]
!*[Effort Grunt while taking key]

Id: [0x0007F957]
!*[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x0007F958]
!*Hello?

Id: [0x0007F959]
!*Lads? Lieutenant? You out here?

Id: [0x0007F95A]
!*Jenkins. What's the news?

Id: [0x0007F95C]
!*It's damn near a Riot out there. And I reckon Kenway suspects something. He don't miss much.

Id: [0x0007F95E]
!*What about our man?

Id: [0x0007F95F]
!*They've been pressing him hard all night, but he's not broken yet.

Id: [0x0007F960]
!*Good.

Id: [0x0007F962]
!*What was that?

Id: [0x0007F964]
!*You certain you didn't bring some of those sand Rats in tow, Jenkins?

Id: [0x0007F965]
!*Look sharp. Stevens, make certain there's no Surprises.

Id: [0x0007F966]
!*Aye, sir.

Id: [0x0007F967]
!*Secure the other side and watch the path.

Id: [0x0007F968]
!*Aye.

Id: [0x0007F96B]
!*Uh... Nothing here. Oh, Why is it always me sent into the Muck?

Id: [0x0007F96E]
!*Stay here. Shoot anything that moves.

Id: [0x0007F96F]
!*Yes, sir.

Id: [0x0007F970]
!*Come on. It's time.

Id: [0x0007F974]
!*Tell me about the beach.

Id: [0x0007F975]
!*A fair gathering, sir. Most too drunk to stand.

Id: [0x0007F976]
!*That will suit our purpose.

Id: [0x0007F978]
!*Thought for a moment I'd die there. Bloody savages.

Id: [0x0007F979]
!*Have no fear, Soldier. This will be the end of them.

Id: [0x0007F97B]
!*Quickly, send the signal.

Id: [0x0007F97E]
!*What?!

Id: [0x0007F97F]
!*Get him!

Id: [0x0007F988]
!*Stations, lads!

Id: [0x0007F989]
!*Today you fight for your Lives alone!

Id: [0x0007F98A]
!*Raise the Black Flag, Lads. Let 'em see it!

Id: [0x0007F98C]
!*Mortar!

Id: [0x0007F98E]
!*Captain! Broadside!

Id: [0x0007F990]
!*She's heading right for us, captain!

Id: [0x0007F991]
!*She's ready to be boarded!

Id: [0x0007F992]
!*Brace!

Id: [0x0007F993]
!*Brace! Braaaaace!

Id: [0x0007F995]
!*Board!

Id: [0x0007F999]
!*Ah. But they're stalling, thinking up Ways to avoid paying it out.

Id: [0x0007F99A]
!*[Effort Grunt]

Id: [0x0007F99B]
!*[Effort sound while getting up]

Id: [0x0007F99C]
!*I can arrange to have you in Thummikins [an old Scottish torture device]if flogging's too kind, Kenway.

Id: [0x0007F99D]
!*Find a way in.

Id: [0x0007F99E]
!*Go on, I'll follow.

Id: [0x0007F99F]
!*If you wait too long, we'll miss our Chance.

Id: [0x0007F9A0]
!*Find a Hole in the Fence.

Id: [0x0007F9A1]
!*I'll follow you.

Id: [0x0007F9A2]
!*Go on!

Id: [0x0007F9A4]
!*Now you'll pay, boy! Them's the rules. Unless you tell me where she hid it.

Id: [0x0007F9A5]
!*If you rethink that, it'll hurt less.

Id: [0x0007F9A6]
!*I don't care.

Id: [0x0007F9A7]
!*How should I know.

Id: [0x0007F9A9]
!*He has many bodyguards. You will not get to him without crossing them.

Id: [0x0007F9AA]
!*You! Where is Patience Gibbs? What is going on here?

Id: [0x0007F9AD]
!*I don't know. Store them? Smuggle them?

Id: [0x0007F9AE]
!*Smuggle them away from his own smuggling operation?

Id: [0x0007F9AF]

!*Smuggling from a smuggler. [laughter]

Id: [0x0007F9B2]

Id: [0x0007F9B3]
!*Who ever thinks about words?

Id: [0x0007F9B4]
!*Well, not me, certainly, but say it: "smuggler."

!*Smuggler.

Id: [0x0007F9B6]
!*Smuggler!

Id: [0x0007F9B7]
!*You're right. It does have kind of a funny ring to it. Smuggler!

Id: [0x0007F9B8]
!*Wait mate. Maybe we shouldn't be saying it quite so loud though?

Id: [0x0007F9B9]
!*On account of it being smuggling?

Id: [0x0007F9BA]
!*Right.

Id: [0x0007F9BB]
!*Right.

Id: [0x0007F9BC]
!*Will the others be waiting for us when we get there?

Id: [0x0007F9BE]
!*Yes. This should be easy.

Id: [0x0007F9BF]
!*So we move the goods. Then we go to the inn.

Id: [0x0007F9C0]
!*Oh, we should be so lucky!

Id: [0x0007F9F1]

Id: [0x0007F9F2]

Id: [0x0007F9F3]
!*But have you no imagination? Can you not imagine the luxurious life that awaits us once we unearth its bounty?

Id: [0x0007F9F4]
!*I really don't think--

Id: [0x0007F9F5]
!*The Travers Estate and Plantations. No more smuggling. No more organizing men. No shipments. No risk. Why not begin now?

Id: [0x0007FAEB]
!*Captain, there's a Wreck yonder. Looks recent.

Id: [0x0007FAEC]
!*I see it. Let's hope Thatch hasn't come to the same End.

Id: [0x0007FAFC]

Id: [0x0007FB09]
!*You stirred up a Nest of Trouble, Thatch!

!*In service of a noble Cause.

Id: [0x0007FB0B]
!*Medicines, I hope you mean!

Id: [0x0007FB23]
!*I'll see you back to your Jackdaw when the Smoke has cleared. But for now I need a Helmsman.

Id: [0x0007FB24]

Id: [0x0007FB25]

Id: [0x0007FD35]
!*Not in the Least, no.

Id: [0x0007FD36]
!*For certain, there's more to be learned by Doing than Reading. Remember that!

Id: [0x0007FD38]
!*Blast! And the Galleon's all but sunk!

Id: [0x0007FD3A]
!*Do it, Kenway! Pilot her straight at her Waist!

Id: [0x0007FD3C]
!*Ram her, Kenway! She'll limp away otherwise!

Id: [0x0007FD62]
!*Bonnet, you never did say how you came to find company with Thatch. I'm curious.

Id: [0x0007FD63]
!*Didn't I?

Id: [0x0007FD64]
!*I came upon his Vessel sitting dead in the Water, and finding him in such a poor way, I Liberated him from further Misfortune.

Id: [0x0007FD65]
!*Yes. Knowing little of maritime Life, it profits me best to relent to Thatch's Expertise.

Id: [0x0007FD66]

Id: [0x000803EC]
!*How do you mean, Sir?

Id: [0x000803ED]
!*If one wishes to use the Observatory to, say... spy on King George, then one would require a Drop of the King's Blood to do so.

Id: [0x000803EE]
!*Does Torres mean to Spy on me then? For I've just given him a Sample of my Blood.

Id: [0x000803EF]
!*As have I, Captain Hornigold. As will all Templars. It is a Measure of Insurance.

Id: [0x000803F0]
!*And Trust, I reckon.

Id: [0x000803F1]
!*Yes, but fear not. Torres has shipped our Samples to a Templar Safehouse in Rio de Janeiro. We will not be the Observatory's first Subjects, I assure you.

Id: [0x000803F2]
!*Aye, Sir. I suppose it's a small Price to pay for what the Templars have given me in return.

Id: [0x000803F7]

Id: [0x00080481]
!*I did always want to Sail a Ship, that's true. But not for a Lark. To support us. To take care of her... and you.

Id: [0x00080482]
!*Not me. Mother said you didn't know about me. She said you wrote only once a Year, and that she never knew where to find you.

Id: [0x00080483]
!*That's all true. And I'm sorry for that. If I had known earlier... I don't know. I might have come Home. I hope that I would have.

Id: [0x00080489]

Id: [0x0008048A]
!*Why, then everything is a Ship, large and small, but for my Toy Boat. The one I take into the Bath with me.

!*And what Measures are we taking to recover the Princess from these Pirates?

Id: [0x00080865]

Id: [0x00080867]
!*I see.

Id: [0x00080868]
!*I have been using my King's Pardon as an Excuse to collect Samples from as many Men as possible. And when they refuse, I hang them. All within the Boundaries of my Mandate, of course.

Id: [0x00080869]
!*Good. For if we cannot keep Watch on all the World's Scoundrels, then the Seas should be rid of them entirely.

Id: [0x00080A79]

Id: [0x00080BC8]
!*Aye, there'll be two Soldiers waiting for us at the Crossroads.

Id: [0x00080BCA]

Id: [0x00080BCC]
!*Where are the Soldiers, Captain Hornigold?

Id: [0x00080BE3]
!*Why, who chases me now, eh? Is it a Specter come to spook me? Or the gaunt Remains of a Man I sent to Hell!

Id: [0x00080BF0]
!*He's lobbing Mortar Shot on us!

Id: [0x00080BF1]
!*Careful of that Mortar fire!

Id: [0x00080BF2]
!*Steer clear of that, Captain!

Id: [0x00080BF3]
!*The way is blocked, Captain!

Id: [0x00080BF4]
!*We'll have to find another Path!

Id: [0x00080BF5]
!*Can't sail through here, Edward!

Id: [0x00080C00]
!*We'll have a hard Fight if Hornigold draws us any deeper into this Fog. We're nearing the "The Devil's Backbone".

Id: [0x00080C01]
!*You mean them Crags that look like the Backbone of a Beast?

Id: [0x00080C02]
!*Aye. [SP][El Espinazo del Diablo](The Devil's Backbone) the Spaniards call it.

Id: [0x00080C05]
!*The Winds are tossing him about like a Toy!

Id: [0x00080C06]
!*We can use that to get close.

Id: [0x00080C07]
!*If we're not dashed to Pieces as well.

Id: [0x00080C0A]
!*Can you do this, Breddah? Is your Heart up for it?

Id: [0x00080C0B]
!*Truth be told, I was hoping the Sea would swallow him up, and see the Job done for me.

Id: [0x00080C0C]
!*There's Hornigold. Get in close.

Id: [0x00080C16]
!*We've just enough Crew to Sail now. Let's take this Ship!

Id: [0x00080C67]
!*As you've likely seen, the Number of Merchants roving these Waters is three Score the Number of Military Ships.

Id: [0x00080C68]
!*Aye. Easy Purchase, but in small Doses.

Id: [0x00080C69]
!*Right. So to lure the Navy out of hiding, it's best to cause a bit of Mischief.

Id: [0x00080C6A]
!*Catch a few small Fish to attract the Big ones.

Id: [0x00080C6B]
!*That's right. So plunder and pillage as you see fit, Captain Kenway.

Id: [0x00080C7C]
!*Sail ho! Military-class Brig on the Horizon.

Id: [0x00080C7D]
!*Good Eye, Man.

Id: [0x00080C7E]
!*Are you ready for this, Kenway? For she won't go down without an honest Fight.

Id: [0x00080C7F]
!*Who's up for taking that Brig, Lads! Shout "Aye"!

Id: [0x00080C81]
!*That's a Sound I like to hear. Pipe to Quarters! All Hands to Cannons!

Id: [0x00080C85]
!*Careful around the Navy. They're as likely to ram you as fire a Broadside.

Id: [0x00080C86]
!*Let's test those Powder Barrels against them, shall we?

Id: [0x00080C87]
!*Aye. Good thinking.

Id: [0x00080C92]
!*So sharpen your cutlasses, shine your hooks, and sail with the "Devils of the Caribbean!"

Id: [0x00080C94]
!*This Virtual Experience has not been rated.

Id: [0x00080C95]
!*Can you find something to lower the platform?

Id: [0x00080C96]
!*You'll have to lower that platform, somehow.

Id: [0x00080C9C]
!*That was a Rumble, by God! How'd we fare?

Id: [0x00080C9D]
!*A fine Purchase, no Mistake! Now I think it's time to lay low and bribe our way back into Secrecy.

Id: [0x00080C9E]
!*Agreed. So how do we get rid of the Notoriety we've stirred up?

Id: [0x00080C9F]
!*Money, my Boy. A well placed Bribe to the right Government Official will see the Military off your Tail.

Id: [0x00080CA0]
!*Right. Let's do that. I'll need to meet these good Samaritans at some point.

Id: [0x00080CA1]
!*Smart thinking. 

Id: [0x00080CA4]
!*That Ship's a Monster! Look at the Size of her!

Id: [0x00080CA5]
!*Aye. And we'd not last long Face to Face with her. You hear that, Kenway? Keep your Distance, and we'll strike when Fortune favors us.

Id: [0x00080CA6]
!*Under Cover of Darkness, most likely.

Id: [0x00080CA7]
!*Aye, it may come to that.

Id: [0x00080CAB]
!*Bleeding Bastards! We'll have to deal with this Skirmish fast. Forget the Galleon and send these interlopers to Hell.

Id: [0x00080CB2]
!*Another bit of Wreckage, Captain. This is looking Grim.

Id: [0x00080CB3]
!*Aye. Keep your Eyes peeled.

Id: [0x00080CF2]
!*What's our Course, Captain?

Id: [0x00080CF3]
!*We're looking for Slave Ships. Any that work for the Royal African Company.

Id: [0x00080CF4]
!*You don't mean to traffic in Human Cargo now, do you?

Id: [0x00080CF5]
!*No. Jaysus, Adé. You know me better than that. We're only after Information. Looking to find where the Princess docks in her spare Time.

Id: [0x00080CF6]
!*The Princess... a slave ship?

Id: [0x00080CF7]
!*Aye. Blackbeard told me there was a good Chance we'd find the Sage aboard her.

Id: [0x00080CF8]
!*Captain. Vane's just sunk a Merchant Schooner.

Id: [0x00080CF9]
!*Damn! Can't that Animal stay the Course we agreed to?

Id: [0x00080CFB]
!*Damn that Captain Vane! He's unloading everything he has.

Id: [0x00080CFC]
!*He'll sink it if he's not careful. We'll get closer.

Id: [0x00080D00]
!*Keep wide of the Fort, Captain. Those Cannons have a long Reach.

Id: [0x00080D02]
!*If we time it right, we can use our Fort to our Advantage.

Id: [0x00080D03]
!*Keen thinking, Quartermaster!

Id: [0x00080D06]
!*You still in one Piece, Vane?

Id: [0x00080D07]
!*Chase those Bastards down, Kenway! I'll murder the Men who scuttled my Ship!

Id: [0x00080D08]
!*Keep calm, Mate. Remember what we're after!

Id: [0x00080D0A]
!*We're going over! Find the Captain!

Id: [0x00080D0D]
!*[Shock and Whimper as Roberts pokes him in the back with a gun] Ah!

Id: [0x00080D10]
!*The walls of this Canyon hug damn close, Captain. We'd best be quiet.

Id: [0x00080D13]
!*Ah, you see here? The Handiwork of Men born and bred to protect this place. The Guardians of the Observatory.

Id: [0x00080D14]
!*How long have their Kind been here?

Id: [0x00080D15]
!*Oh... at least a thousand Years or more. Dedicated Men. Very deadly.

Id: [0x00080D19]
!*You've got the Flag?

Id: [0x00080D1A]
!*Aye. And we're flying it now. This should do nicely.

Id: [0x00080D43]
!*The Chest they hauled ashore was full of empty Vials. Where's our Portuguese Captain?

Id: [0x00080D44]
!*He had outlived his Usefulness.

Id: [0x00080D45]
!*Where is he?

Id: [0x00080D46]
!*Sleeping soundly at the bottom of the Sea.

Id: [0x00080D47]
!*[Angry sigh]How many men must we kill for a Simple Prize?

Id: [0x00080D68]

Id: [0x00080F92]

!*This is a Score too big to miss, Kenway. Sail after him!

Id: [0x00080F9A]

Id: [0x00080F9B]

Id: [0x00080F9E]
!*Sorry, Sir. Been a hot Day.

Id: [0x00080F9F]
!*There was a dodgy Ship following close behind my own Vessel today. And It would be a shame if the Rapscallions aboard her were to slip ashore, right under your nose, only because you couldn't stand the Bloody heat!

Id: [0x00080FA0]
!*Apologies, Sir. I'll keep my Eyes peeled.

Id: [0x00080FA2]

Id: [0x00080FB4]
!*This is as far as she'll go, Captain.

Id: [0x00080FB5]
!*Then I'll have to go on without her.

Id: [0x0008103D]
!*That's unsettling. To think we're not even safe where we work.

Id: [0x0008103E]
!*I know. Two months ago I left a couple books on my desk, and they disappeared for a few days.

Id: [0x0008103F]
!*Stolen?

Id: [0x00081040]
!*Well, someone returned them a few days later with a little note that said "Thanks!" But still, scary.

!*Mm, I don't know. Maybe Manchester in the late seventies. Or New York in the early eighties. Lot of bands Id like to see.

Id: [0x0008107B]
!*That's it? What about the Mongolian empire in the thirteenth century?

Id: [0x0008107C]

Id: [0x0008109A]
!*Aye, and look here: a solid Staircase leading God knows where.

Id: [0x0008109D]
!*Couple years now. I met Ah Tabai in Spanish-town, and there was something about him I trusted. A sort of Wisdom.

Id: [0x0008109E]
!*Is all this his Idea? His Clan?

Id: [0x0008109F]
!*The Natives of this New World had a Philosophy like our Creed for as long as they've been here. And when Europeans arrived, our Groups sort of... matched up.

Id: [0x000810A0]
!*Cultures and Religions and Languages keep Folks divided... but there's something in the Assassin's Creed that crosses all Boundaries. A Fondness for Life and Liberty.

Id: [0x000810A1]
!*Sounds a bit like Nassau, no?

Id: [0x000810A2]

Id: [0x000810A3]
!*And what will this Effort gain me?

Id: [0x000810A4]
!*Respect, for a Start. From the Men and Women you put in Danger here.

Id: [0x000810A6]
!*And if that ain't enough,[Beat] there's a Treasure behind that Door. Something many Centuries old.

Id: [0x000810A7]
!*I reckon if you made the Effort to find every last one of those, it'd be worth your While.

!*Hey!

Id: [0x000827E0]
!*Duncan, you know the Assassins best. What will be their Strategy?

Id: [0x000827E1]
!*Kill or be Killed, I imagine.

Id: [0x000827E2]
!*This is no Time for Jesting!

Id: [0x000827E5]
!*Something is Wrong. Stay close, Grandmaster!

Id: [0x000827EA]
!*A Pity we have been discovered, eh, Duncan? These Assassins must be confused by your Appearance here.

Id: [0x000827EB]
!*Confused, aye. More than a little, I'd say.

Id: [0x000827EE]
!*One of your early Letters mentioned a Desire to kill the Mayan Mentor, Ah Tabai. Were you able to carry out this Contract before coming here?

Id: [0x000827EF]
!*I... I was not, no. Too many... complications along the way.

Id: [0x000827F0]
!*A Pity. But the Maps you delivered with this Vial will see that Job finished.

Id: [0x000827F1]
!*Aye. That's the Idea.

Id: [0x000827F2]
!*Enough Prattling! We must be quiet and cautious, or everyone dies!

Id: [0x000827F3]
!*Assassins!

Id: [0x000827F4]
!*Above! They're on the Rooftops!

Id: [0x000827F5]
!*Watch the Streets and Alleys. They could be anywhere!

Id: [0x000827FA]
!*I've made my Choice, Adé.[beat] I'm calling her the Jackdaw, for a sly Bird I loved as a Child back in Swansea.

Id: [0x000827FB]
!*A dark little Creature, no?

Id: [0x000827FC]
!*Did it rub you wrong when I took this Brig as my own?

Id: [0x000827FD]
!*Rest and Repast would do us Good before Nassau. Water for Drinking. And Hunting for Food and Repairs.

Id: [0x000827FE]
!*Well reasoned, Sir. Hunting it shall be. We'll find a decent Place to drop Anchor.

Id: [0x00082DD9]
!*[laughs] It was the sort of Rub I have learned to endure sailing among Faces of such... Fairness.[he toys with the word "Fairness"]

Id: [0x00082DDA]
!*[Laughs at the joke] It's true, most of these Men wouldn't accept you as a Captain.[beat] So what fair Role would complement such Unfairness?

Id: [0x00082DDB]
!*I'll be your Quartermaster. Nothing less.

Id: [0x00082DDC]
!*All right. And as Quartermaster, have you any immediate Counsel for this tyro Captain?

Id: [0x00083166]
!*Come on Tad! You’ve had your Fill. Stop blubbering and get back to the ship.

Id: [0x00083167]
!*Just one more, Jimmy, just one more in memory of her!

Id: [0x00083168]
!*All right, all right. I'll fetch us another. One Mug each.

Id: [0x000831AD]
!*Christ Edward, is that something that needs explaining?[Beat] Now, I'm here to do a Job. I'll let you be amused later.

Id: [0x000831C4]
!*I spied a few Items in the Hold earlier... Powder and a few Pistols. I think I'll fashion a second Holster if I can.

Id: [0x000831C9]
!*Here we are. Take that Stone you discovered from the Mayan Stele, and put it there.

Id: [0x000831CA]
!*Surely our superior Weapons give us the upper hand.

Id: [0x000831CB]
!*Maybe. Still, I say, you hear that Horn, you're in trouble.

Id: [0x000831D0]
!*Cockpits, you say?

Id: [0x000831D1]
!*The Highlands, furrowed through.

Id: [0x000831D2]
!*Furrowed, now?

Id: [0x000831D3]
!*Earthquakes, man. They attack from Ravines and Gaps and Caves and Fissures made by Earthquakes.

Id: [0x000831D4]
!*[laughter] "Cockpits."

Id: [0x000831D5]

Id: [0x00083651]
!*That sounds devious.

Id: [0x00083652]
!*Not terribly. Most of my Work is charitable. I am proud to say I have recently secured Funding for a Hospital in Havana.

Id: [0x00083654]
!*My goodness, you are a soft Heart, Torres. Here we are, of roughly equal Age, and yet - while you scurry about throwing Money at all manner of Quibbles - I am content to simply relax and rejoice in my earned Fortune.

Id: [0x00083655]
!*To each his own Defects, [SP][Señor](Mister) Prins.

Id: [0x00083658]
!*I grow tired of this Walk. We must be close.

Id: [0x00083659]
!*Yes, just here. We must be on equal Footing you see? I don't trust Templars any more than you must trust me.

Id: [0x0008365A]
!*Well, if I had known you were so skittish, I'd have brought you a Bouquet of Flowers.

Id: [0x0008365B]
!*Ah, I don't know why I bother... for the Money, I suppose. The vast Sums of Money.

Id: [0x0008365E]
!*Could we talk a Moment about the Condition of the Ship?

Id: [0x0008365F]
!*What's the Trouble?

Id: [0x00083661]
!*I had a walk about the Gundeck this Morning, and couldn't stand for what I saw. A Clutter of Linstocks heaped like Tinder... and one with a Slowmatch still burning.

Id: [0x00083662]
!*Christ.

Id: [0x00083663]
!*And just nearby, two Barrels of Gunpowder closer than Man and Wife, fit to explode at the Touch of a Spark.

Id: [0x00083664]
!*We'll stow ours, good and proper.

Id: [0x00083665]
!*As for the Cannons, they might as well be tossed. Clogged Touch-holes in need of Scraping; corrosion on the Bodies; Barrel Swabs as naked as Knives; and Breech-ropes so rotted I could use them for knitting Yarn.

Id: [0x00083667]
!*The Short of it is, we need good Equipment, kept in fine Condition. For we cannot win every Battle with Sneers and Shouts. So worry about your own Armaments when it suits you. But don't forget about your Jackdaw as well.

Id: [0x00083668]
!*No, indeed. We'll make it a point to keep this Ship and its Crew in fine Condition.

Id: [0x0008366A]
!*In Madagascar, I offered those Pirates a Choice... take a Pardon and return to England penniless but free Men, or be hanged by the Neck until dead.

Id: [0x0008366B]
!*[Laugh]It's not like you to gloat, Rogers.

Id: [0x0008366C]
!*[Laughs]We all deserve a Moment, don't we?

Id: [0x0008366D]
!*Governor, when you hunted Pirates in Madagascar, what Methods worked best?

Id: [0x0008366E]
!*I believe it was my Charisma that persuaded them. Violence and Threats should always be a last Resort.

Id: [0x0008366F]
!*Just as you did in Nassau.

Id: [0x00083670]

!*Shhh! Keep your Voice down, Man! He's Mates with Governor Rogers!

Id: [0x00083F7A]
!*Is he? That's well odd.

Id: [0x00083F7C]
!*Do you know what I heard? Governor Rogers and Captain Hornigold are part of a secret Society, like. A secret Order that's made up of Frenchies and Spaniards and Italians and even some Turks.

Id: [0x0008406B]
!*Gather those two Men there!

Id: [0x0008406D]
!*You Lads! Follow and Lay aboard. The Commodore has a Job for you.

Id: [0x0008406F]
!*Sir! We have Information for the Commodore. An urgent Matter.

Id: [0x00084070]
!*Carry on.

Id: [0x00084072]
!*Take Positions and prepare to decamp on the Commodore's Orders!

Id: [0x00084073]
!*Aye, Sir!

Id: [0x0008407E]
!*Our initial reports gave us hope that Ezio Auditore would serve as an ideal candidate for future Abstergo Projects. His charisma, sexual magnetism, and wry humor gave him all the qualities of a leading man. However, his corruption by the Assassin order robbed him of these qualities as he fell deeper and deeper into a spiral of revenge.

Id: [0x00084081]
!*As Ezio aged, we found in him all the vileness of a true fascist: glorifying war and violence while driven by a blind hatred for one of the most tolerant Popes the Catholic church has ever known.

Id: [0x00084085]
!*Ezio was frequently known to articulate a passive acceptance of evil.

Id: [0x00084089]
!*He was also a man of ugly contradictions – one who preached free-thought, yet traveled well beyond his home country to proselytize his corrupted Creed, just as he is doing here with this impressionable Chinese girl. Notice, too, that in his gestures and bearing there is still something of the old lecher in him.

Id: [0x0008408D]
!*Ezio's entire personality is built around pure demagoguery... claiming his philosophy is about love when violence and coercion are his primary means of tackling problems. We have therefore come to the conclusion that Ezio Auditore da Firenze would be a risky property to develop.

Id: [0x00084090]
!*Our initial research into the life of Ratonhnhaké:ton focused on a period spanning his late teens to his early thirties.

Id: [0x00084092]
!*But our researchers came away unimpressed by his calm and stoic demeanor, with occasional flashes of extreme anger. This was not the sort of leading man we felt comfortable endorsing.

Id: [0x00084094]
!*We decided, therefore, to delve into his early childhood with the hope that scenes of pre-Colonial America might hold some appeal.

Id: [0x00084096]
!*As you can see here, there is a certain naïve charm and innocence to this young boy.

Id: [0x00084098]
!*Unfortunately, our researchers found this young man's story deeply problematic as well... for one, the omnipresence of the Mohawk culture lacks the balance necessary to tell the true story of America.

Id: [0x0008409A]
!*And secondly, the Mohawk language would certainly be an issue for most of our audience. We therefore feel that although Ratonhnhaké:ton early life would be of some interest to our more educated viewers, it is unlikely that his story would appeal on a broader scale... being too “foreign,” as it were, to normal audiences. Our team recommends we PASS on our property.

Id: [0x0008409F]
!*Ah, that's Bollocks, that is! I've been here a Year and something already.

Id: [0x000840A1]
!*We're under-weigh, Roberts. So what's your Plan?

Id: [0x000840A2]
!*The Flagship of this Fleet is transporting a valuable Treasure in a large Chest. Crystal Vials filled with Blood. You may remember.

Id: [0x000840A3]
!*We're chasing Drams of Blood! Is that all?

Id: [0x000840A4]
!*I asked you to follow my Instructions to the Letter, Captain. But I did not give you Leave to question why.

Id: [0x000840A5]
!*I want those Blood Vials intact. And if that does not happen, we part as Enemies. Do you understand?

Id: [0x000840A6]
!*I'll try to, aye.

Id: [0x000840AB]
!*Those Sailors are carrying something ashore, Captain. A very large chest. Could be the Prize we're after.

Id: [0x000840AD]
!*Hm. Perhaps you should go Ashore, Captain Kenway. Find that Chest. And if it contains the Prize I seek, bring it here.

Id: [0x000840AE]
!*Aye. That's the way I'd play it.

Id: [0x0008431C]
!*He said it marked the Locations of "Assassin" encampments.

Id: [0x00084339]
!*Fancy seeing you here, Kenway, still looking Sleek and Mean.[Beat] Did you steal that Costume from a Dandy in Havana?

Id: [0x0008433A]
!*No, Sir. I found this on a Corpse... one that was walking about and talking Shite to my face only Moments before.

Id: [0x0008433B]
!*Ah...

Id: [0x00084343]
!*I know my Targets by Sight well enough. But how will I find them?

Id: [0x00084344]
!*We have Spies and Informants in every City. Visit our Bureaus, and the Assassins there will guide you.

Id: [0x00084345]
!*That fixes Torres and Rogers... but Bartholomew Roberts won't be near any City. Might take Months to find him.

Id: [0x00084346]
!*Or years. But you are a man of Talent and Quality, Captain Kenway. I believe you will find him.

Id: [0x00084347]
!*Quartermaster. What's our present Course?

Id: [0x00084348]
!*Due West, Captain. If it's still Kingston we're sailing for.

Id: [0x00084349]
!*It is indeed, Miss Bonny. Call it out.

Id: [0x00084544]
!*What of Thatch, Sir? Did he fall?

Id: [0x00084546]
!*Captain?

Id: [0x00084548]
!*He drinks Damnation.

Id: [0x0008454E]
!*[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x0008454F]
!*Hello?

!*Lads? Lieutenant? You out here?

Id: [0x00084551]
!*Jenkins. What's the News?

Id: [0x00084553]
!*There was a Deserter among them who recalled my Face. I sliced into his Gullet before any Word left his Lips.

Id: [0x00084555]
!*Anybody see you?

Id: [0x00084556]
!*Don't think so, Sir. But I reckon Kenway suspects something. He don't miss much.

Id: [0x00084559]
!*What was that?

Id: [0x0008455B]
!*You certain you didn't bring some of those sand Rats in tow, Jenkins?

Id: [0x0008455C]

Id: [0x0008455D]

!*Come on. It's Time.

Id: [0x0008456B]

Id: [0x0008456C]

!*Everyone on my new team is named Ben. Two Benoits, a Benjamin and Bénédicte, who you know already.

Id: [0x00085015]

Id: [0x00085016]

Id: [0x00085428]
!*Shall we set Sail for-

Id: [0x0008542A]
!*You're leaving?

Id: [0x0008542C]
!*When your Heart and your Head are ready, visit the Assassins. I think you'll understand then...

Id: [0x00085437]
!*And if you're at a Loss, do not be afraid to call on your Quartermaster for Aid.

Id: [0x0008543D]
!*Weigh Anchor and let fall the Courses, Lads! We're sailing for Jamaica!

Id: [0x00085441]
!*How does it feel to bark so Loud?

Id: [0x00085442]
!*I've Barked louder, and to Men twice as Rough.

Id: [0x00085443]
!*Tending Bar at the Old Avery, you mean?

Id: [0x00085444]
!*Among other Places. [beat]And I sailed with Mary and Rackham for a Time, remember?

Id: [0x00085445]
!*Of course.

Id: [0x00085446]
!*Mary did most of the Captaining. Jack did most of the Drinking.

Id: [0x0008544A]
!*Have you tried Great Workouts in History, yet?

Id: [0x0008544B]
!*No, I'm kind of addicted to my Seven Minute Workout. And Running.

Id: [0x0008544C]
!*Yeah, why?

Id: [0x0008544D]
!*It's literally all in your head. There's no cardio in that.

Id: [0x0008544E]
!*What do you mean?

Id: [0x0008544F]
!*You've been sitting, buddy. Sitting. That's not exercise. Does marketing know people can't tell the difference? That's just evil.

Id: [0x00085450]
!*I just don't understand the appeal of small dogs. A German shepherd. A Doberman. Great Danes. THOSE are dogs. Golden retrievers. I'm going to get a retriever. Am I right, Matty?

Id: [0x00085451]
!*I'm surrounded by charlatans.

Id: [0x00085452]
!*Yes! With the scrunchy face, and the floppy ears? Adorable.

Id: [0x00085453]
!*I got stuck in the Atrium elevator again for, I swear, 40 minutes yesterday. The thing just wouldn't acknowledge I wanted to leave. I don't know how they think they can run a "World Class Entertainment Company" with everyone stuck in elevators all the time.

Id: [0x00085454]
!*Uhm... I think that's just you. I've never been stuck in the elevator. I've never heard of anyone else getting stuck.

Id: [0x00085455]
!*What? No. This is a regular thing. It has to be. It can't only be me.

Id: [0x00085456]
!*Yup. I'm afraid it's personal.

Id: [0x00085457]
!*This place is starting to give me the creeps.

Id: [0x00085458]
!*Do you think all this security stuff means they'll finally do something about the elevators?

Id: [0x00085459]
!*What about the elevators?

Id: [0x0008545A]
!*I can't believe you're bringing this up now!

Id: [0x0008545B]
!*Wait, you sound annoyed. I thought you'd be concerned, but you sound really annoyed.

Id: [0x0008545C]
!*I'm insulted. Everything is due. We have this hacker scandal hanging over our heads, and you pick now to complain about "sexism" or whatever this misunderstanding is?

Id: [0x0008545D]
!*So what I'm hearing is that, like our players, you find feminism insulting, and feel that it gets in the way of more important things?

Id: [0x0008545E]
!*[after a beat] Fine. I'll deal with it.

Id: [0x0008545F]
!*Well, have you done the math? That's like a year and a half. They're not allowed to do that!

Id: [0x00085460]
!*I think the idea is that you're supposed to love your job enough to put in the extra time.

Id: [0x00085461]
!*Said the guy who takes three hour lunches.

Id: [0x00085462]
!*Don't say that so loud.

Id: [0x00085491]
!*Is this what they call Mayan?[Beat] Or is it Aztec?

Id: [0x00085492]
!*Only wait 'til you see what lies at the End!

Id: [0x000854B4]
!*Well done, Lap-Dog.

Id: [0x000854B5]
!*Good.

Id: [0x000854B6]
!*Hmmm.

Id: [0x000854B7]
!*Nope.

Id: [0x000854B8]
!*You cracked it! Good. The file should be downloading.

Id: [0x000854B9]
!*Everything you download will be found in there. Protected by a firewall, of course.

Id: [0x000854BA]
!*Hey! I didn't see where you'd run off to. Just thought you should know... the cabinet behind you is reserved for Abstergo Rewards only. So try not to clutter it up with personal things. Otherwise the cleaners will be told to toss them. Company policy, unfortunately... later!

Id: [0x000854BC]
!*Instructions on your screen should show you how to control the data. Just be gentle.

Id: [0x000854BD]
!*Up we go!

Id: [0x00085504]
!*But on the up-side, it took no time to learn everyone's name this morning.

Id: [0x00085505]
!*I don't know... it's kind of sterile. I always feel like someone's watching me.

Id: [0x00085506]
!*Yeah, but the floors don't creak, there's no mice...

Id: [0x00085507]
!*The elevators don't scare me.

Id: [0x00085508]
!*Feels like a high-tech company, finally.

Id: [0x00085509]
!*Yeah... that's true.

Id: [0x00085547]
!*Keep it to 3 hours sessions, like the regulations say. They don't make these rules for no reason.

Id: [0x00085548]
!*Yeah, I've been pushing it to 5, 6 hours every day.

Id: [0x00085549]
!*Damn.

Id: [0x0008554A]
!*That's enough to trigger a bleeding effect, man. You need to be cautious. They've made progress on that front, but there's always a danger.

Id: [0x00085568]
!*I wish I could say this was illegal but... they actually have a legal right to do this.

Id: [0x00085569]
!*Really?

Id: [0x0008556A]
!*Yeah. With the highest levels of security clearance from seventeen different countries, Abstergo actually has a legal right to arrest and detain people too. It's crazy.

Id: [0x0008556B]
!*Wasn't he always talking about visiting New Orleans? Maybe he took a vacation.

Id: [0x0008556C]
!*I don't know... his coat is still here. And there's a full mug of coffee sitting by his animus headset.

Id: [0x0008556D]
!*That's odd.

Id: [0x0008556E]
!*Yeah. How is this not fake?

Id: [0x0008556F]
!*It's this big list of items we're supposed to be looking for while we're doing our research. Thing is, most of these things are bullshit, aren't they? Apples, Shrouds, Crystal Skulls, Memory Seals...

Id: [0x00085570]
!*[Laughs]Sounds like the inside of a conspiracy freak's closet.

Id: [0x00085571]
!*Poking around the servers I found a small bit of sequenced data on Joan of Arc. Minutes after loading it up, security was at my desk.

Id: [0x00085572]
!*Yeah. They confiscated my Animus key, and now my position here is "under review".

Id: [0x00085573]
!*Are you kidding? That's...[Beat] that's... scary.

Id: [0x00085574]
!*Yeah, but you actually have to work for it.

Id: [0x00085575]
!*[Laughs]

Id: [0x0008557E]
!*You cant steal an animus. They're all dummy terminals. Connected to the cloud servers.

Id: [0x0008557F]
!*Well, if he's an idot, that wouldn't stop him from trying.

Id: [0x00085580]
!*I think I preferred the security lock-down. At least then I knew I wasn't the one fucking up.

Id: [0x00085581]
!*Oh yeah, definitely.

Id: [0x00085582]
!*That's an odd way to describe a job interview.

Id: [0x00085583]
!*[FR][Je pourrais faire sa job. Pas de problème.](I could do his job. No question.)

Id: [0x00085584]
!*[FR][Ah ouais, tu penses ça toi ?](Oh you think so?)

Id: [0x00085585]
!*[FR][Directeur de création ? Calice ! Plutôt directeur de rien foutre. Il faisait rien. Avec moi, les choses auraient été différentes dans cette compagnie.](Chief Creative Officer? Câlice! More like Chief Lazy Hipster. He didn't do anything. I'd turn this company around.)

Id: [0x00085586]
!*No way. He flew to Chicago for the annual shareholder's meeting and just vanished. Never even showed up to the meeting.

Id: [0x00085587]
!*Where did you hear that? I haven't heard anything.

Id: [0x00085588]
!*I keep my ear to the ground. I have connections.

Id: [0x00085589]
!*[FR][Ah... L'année a été rough. J'ai vraiment besoin de vacances.](I need a vacation. It's been a rough year.)

Id: [0x0008558A]
!*[FR][Moi, je pars bientôt. Je vais passer quelques semaines chez mes parents.](I've got one coming up. Going to visit my parents for a few weeks.)

Id: [0x0008558B]
!*[FR][À Québec, Hein?](Quebec city, right?)

Id: [0x0008558C]
!*[FR][Laval.](Laval.)

Id: [0x0008558D]
!*[FR][Mmh. Cool.](Mm. Fun.)

Id: [0x0008558E]
!*[FR][Ma chambre est toujours prête au cas où, même après tout ce temps.](They've still got my bedroom made up for me, all these years later.)

Id: [0x0008558F]
!*See that flashing wireless signal? It means you're hooked up to the elevator.

Id: [0x00085597]
!*[FR][Caline.](Dammit.)

Id: [0x00085598]
!*[FR][Pourquoi ?](Why?)

Id: [0x00085599]
!*[FR][Y'a juste un gars à l'informatique… ché pas. Non, oublie ça.] (There's this guy down in IT... I don't know. Forget it.)

Id: [0x0008559A]
!*Any water. Anything from a tap. There was a problem with the treatment plant in Atwater and now half the city is affected.

Id: [0x0008559B]
!*Oh man. Maybe that's why my stomach hurts today.

Id: [0x0008559C]
!*I guess they found a couple dead rats in one of the filters. You better get that checked out.

Id: [0x0008559D]
!*Don't tell me that. Seriously.

Id: [0x0008559E]
!*You know what it reminds me of? A cathedral. An old cathedral, like you find around town.

Id: [0x0008559F]
!*They made me think of a science-fiction film. All sleek and moody.

Id: [0x000855A0]
!*Which one? Which film?

Id: [0x000855A1]
!*All of them!

Id: [0x000855A5]
!*Is it illegal when other companies call you at work and ask you to apply?

Id: [0x000855A6]
!*Yeah, its called head hunting. Why? Did someone call you?

Id: [0x000855A7]
!*Yeah, some HR guy from BLUME, the security firm in Chicago...

Id: [0x000855AE]
!*I'm thinking about moving there after my Visa runs out here.

Id: [0x000855AF]
!*You're American?.

Id: [0x000855B0]
!*Yeah. I have a few friends working for BLUME down there. I think that sort of thing is more up my alley. Hardware. Infrastructure. I'm just not happy here. Not really...

Id: [0x000855DB]
!*Ahhh. Now here some data streams are moving! That means, after entering one, your data will start moving with the stream.

Id: [0x000855DC]
!*And if you look closely, part of the stream is secured. And you can't move through a secured space... so hey, avoid them.

Id: [0x000855DE]
!*Ah, these security programs can be really nasty. They occupy the entire data stream and are constantly changing their state between active and inactive.

Id: [0x000855DF]
!*When they're inactive, they're harmless. But when they become active, your data will be destroyed instantly. So proceed with caution.

Id: [0x000855E3]
!*Back to hacking, eh? I see here you found some moving data streams. That means, after entering a one, your data will start moving with the stream.

Id: [0x000855E4]
!*And if you look closely, part of the stream is secured. So you can't move through that space... best to avoid the secured portion.

Id: [0x000855E6]
!*You're quite fond of this, aren't you? Well now you've run into a fully secured stream running the width of the node. Fortunately, the stream will constantly changing its state between active and inactive.

Id: [0x000855E7]
!*The point she's getting to is this: When a secured stream is inactive, it's harmless. But when one becomes active, your data will be destroyed instantly. So proceed with caution.

Id: [0x000855EA]
!*Ha ha! This core is a little different. Your communicator should show you information about the new programs needed to crack it.

Id: [0x000855EB]
!*I’m detecting some new programs. Sending you the details now.

Id: [0x000855EC]
!*Additional programs have been triggered, unfortunately. The information should be on your screen in a second.

Id: [0x000855ED]
!*Shit, they’ve put some nasty programs around that core. But the upgrades I made to your communicator should be able to figure it out.

Id: [0x000855F0]
!*Hello there. It seems some of these programs are a little different than those you've seen before. Your communicator should give you information about how to break through.

Id: [0x000855F1]
!*Ooh, it's fascinating. I’m detecting some new programs sent to befuddle you. I'll send you the details now.

Id: [0x000855F2]
!*Additional programs have been triggered here, so be careful. More information should be on your screen shortly. Hold on.

Id: [0x000855F3]
!*Dammit, they’ve installed some nasty programs around that core. But the upgrades I made to your communicator should be able to figure it out.

Id: [0x000855F5]
!*Ah. This is an interesting security measure. It looks like you need to find the right combination of numbers to adjust the wave.

Id: [0x000855F6]
!*Easy enough, right? Pick a number selector, then change its value. Once you find the right combination of numbers, you should get access.

Id: [0x000855FC]

Id: [0x00085600]

Id: [0x00085644]
!*Did Mary... did she ever tell you who it was that fathered her Child?

Id: [0x00085645]
!*It was a young Fella. Sailed with us on that last Voyage. [beat] Poor Lad was killed fighting beside us. The only Man not too Drunk to stand up for himself.

Id: [0x00085646]
!*There was so much about her I didn't know. I called her a Friend. But was I One in return?

Id: [0x00085647]
!*She thought the World of you, Edward. Have no Worries about that.

Id: [0x00085648]
!*Well, that's good to hear.

Id: [0x00085651]
!*Thank God you can't experience a person's death in the Animus... that'd be traumatizing.

Id: [0x00085654]
!*Stop that man!

Id: [0x00085655]
!*Oh God!

Id: [0x00085656]
!*You're overreacting to... to a filthy Canard! Lies and Slander meant to discredit me! The simple fact is, that Woman is my secretary. nothing more!

Id: [0x0008565B]
!*[FR][Criss, j'espère qu'ils croient pas que c'est moi le hacker. Faut vraiment que j'arrête de travailler aussi tard.](God, I hope they don't think I'm the hacker. I should really stop working so late.)

Id: [0x0008565D]
!*Wait, no, I don't want to know anything.

Id: [0x00085660]
!*Your colleague's computer is just to the right.

Id: [0x00085665]

Id: [0x00085667]

Id: [0x00085669]
!*Melanie is in there RIGHT NOW, you idiot. Get to the security room before she sees you.

Id: [0x0008567F]
!*Additionally, Aveline spent a disappointing amount of time in the Louisanna Bayou, consorting with smugglers of the lowest kind.

Id: [0x00085682]
!*However, as Aveline matured,  a new side emerged-- a well-manered and considerate lady of poise and compassion.

Id: [0x00085683]
!*Aveline came to embrace a new mentor: her stepmother, Madeleine de l'Isle, a tireless fighter for the rights of slaves.

Id: [0x0008568A]
!*Initial reports on Aveline de Granpré led us to believe she would be too controversial and impulsive to appeal to a wide audience. Teenaged memories show her brainwashed, and trained to kill political foes of her highly unstable Mentor, Agaté.

Id: [0x0008568C]
!*Our team recommends a GO on this property. Get this one to market quickly.

Id: [0x00085761]
!*Our researchers looked into the life of Altaïr Ibn La'Ahad, hoping to find a biography that might serve as a positive role model for Abstergo's global outreach programs. Unfortunately this renegade assassin proved to be no such thing.

Id: [0x00085763]
!*In much of his footage, we see a man gleefully flouting some of his culture's most entrenched taboo's with an arrogance that borders on messianic.

Id: [0x00085765]
!*This coupled with a wholehearted embrace of blatant superstition, paranoid delusions, and the inability to brook even the most modest dissent, and you have the makings of a true demagogue.

Id: [0x00085767]
!*Many of our researchers felt that the arguments articulated by Altaïr's rival - a man known as Abbas - were clearer and more cogent than any we had heard from Altaïr. I recently put in a request that more effort be dedicated to locating one of Abbas's descendants, if any exist.

Id: [0x00085769]
!*It's clear to us that Altair's transgressions were the primary motivation behind the ultimate dissolution of his dispicable order by the middle of the 13th century.

Id: [0x0008576B]
!*We therefore strongly recommend a PASS on this property, in favor of a more agreeable and inspiring figure from this era.

Id: [0x00085776]
!*I've heard it said our Commander calls Captain Woodes Rogers a friend as well.

Id: [0x00085777]
!*The man who rescued Selkirk? That Captain Rogers?

Id: [0x00085778]
!*Aye. A Sailor to his bones. And he's a hard man, he is. Earned a large scar down his left cheek, after taking a pellet to the face. Lodged in his palate for a couple days.

Id: [0x00085779]
!*By Christ! And the man lived?

Id: [0x0008577A]
!*Aye. Broke no stride, in fact, and continued barking orders until the next morning when he took a Splinter to the heel. That took him off his feet for a day.

Id: [0x0008577B]
!*And this is a living, breathing man we're talking about?

Id: [0x0008577C]

Id: [0x0008595D]

Id: [0x0008595E]
!*Oh?

Id: [0x0008595F]
!*Well, um, first of all, I don't really know for sure, OK. I mean... guys think about sex more than girls, right? That's a fact?

Id: [0x00085960]
!*As a researcher, what did you observe?

Id: [0x00085961]
!*Does it mean she's more... like a guy... if she thinks about... Is that why she's able to assassinate-- well OK, here's the thing. I don't know her thoughts. But from what's in her memories, physically-- the fidgeting. Some hesitation. What she looked at. Who she looked away from. The things she didn't say when I expected her to... If I had to GUESS what it meant, I would think she was thinking about... sex. But I'm a guy so I would think that, right? So what does it mean for women to act that way? It has to mean something else, right?

Id: [0x00085969]

!*Stressful?

Id: [0x00085980]
!*Yes. It's best when she goes out as an Assassin. On the roofs or in the Bayou. I think she was more relaxed that way? Can you imagine? You're only relaxed when you're going to go kill someone?

!*Master Kidd hinted at a Prize he was eager to show me down in Tulum. Quite some distance, mind. On the Yucatan Peninsula.

Id: [0x00086CA6]
!*You trust him to play it fair?

Id: [0x00086CA7]
!*I can't be sure. But he has a way of picking away at my Conscience that gives me Pause. I should go see him. Soon.

Id: [0x00086CA8]
!*So long as we take some Prizes along the way, I'm sure the Crew will understand. I'll set a course for Tulum.

Id: [0x00086CAB]
!*The door's Mechanism seems to be broke. Let's find another Way 'round.

Id: [0x00086CAC]
!*Follow on, man!

Id: [0x00086CAD]
!*Jump!

Id: [0x00086CB0]
!*[A sputtering shiver as he emerges from cold water.]

Id: [0x00086CB4]
!*That's it!

Id: [0x00086CB5]
!*That's a Match.

Id: [0x00086CB6]
!*Doesn't seem like the right Match.

Id: [0x00086CB7]
!*That doesn't seem right.

Id: [0x00086CB8]
!*Hm... those don't Match.

Id: [0x00086CB9]
!*This isn't working. Try Something else.

Id: [0x00086CBA]
!*Not sure that belongs there...

Id: [0x00086CBC]
!*Shall we climb these Stones here? Seems like they might move.

Id: [0x00086CBD]
!*Clamber up those Stones, Kenway. I've an Idea.

Id: [0x00086CBE]
!*Might be those Stones are Counterweights.

Id: [0x00086CBF]
!*I reckon this Puzzle works like the last few.

Id: [0x00086CC3]
!*Is it out of Kindness you do this, or Guilt?

Id: [0x00086CC4]
!*It was a Slaver who brought these Soldiers. Laurens Prins himself.

Id: [0x00086CC5]
!*I may thank you later, if you manage to live through this.

Id: [0x00086CC6]
!*Many Thanks, but no Forgiveness.

Id: [0x00086CC9]
!*Are the Stories about you true, sir? You were a Governor in Florida for a Time?

Id: [0x00086CCA]
!*[SP][Sí, sí](Yes, Yes) I am one of a Number of civil Servants in my Family. A long line of Politicians.

Id: [0x00086CCB]
!*I have always toyed with the Idea of entering Politics myself, only I feel I have too much Money and not enough Years.

Id: [0x00086CCC]
!*Speaking of Stories, Prins... I've heard it said you were with Henry Morgan the Day he sacked Panama. Sixteen-seventy-one, was it?

Id: [0x00086CCD]
!*O, it's all true, yes. But let us not over-esteem the Honours forged and won on the Battlefield. That Skirmish was a deadly One, and a tremendous Waste of Coin and Resources.

Id: [0x00086CCE]
!*It wasn't until many Years after that I sheathed my Sword in favor of a far safer and yet more profitable Venture. Capital and Resources. That's where Money is made. And, Sir, let me tell you... Honour bought is more enjoyable than Honour won, if a Touch less permanent.

Id: [0x00086CD2]
!*Stand your Ground, Slave! And face corporal Punishment like a Man.

Id: [0x00086CD3]
!*Why act like a Man now when you have denied me that Right for thirty YEARS!

Id: [0x00086CD4]
!*Fire on the Bastards!

Id: [0x00086CD5]
!*You... you say you came alone, Torres?

Id: [0x00086CD6]
!*Not alone, but certainly without Colleagues. I took Passage aboard a British Merchant's Brig.

Id: [0x00086CD7]
!*Ah...

Id: [0x00086CDD]
!*Guards! Guards! To me!

Id: [0x00086CEF]
!*Help us out now, and we'll help you. My Sister here's poorly, can't you see?

Id: [0x00086CF1]
!*[Vomiting sound]

Id: [0x00086CF3]
!*Do me a Favor, Darling!

Id: [0x00086CF4]
!*Not without a Glint of Silver, I won't!

Id: [0x00086CF5]
!*Come on, Love! I'm burning.

Id: [0x00086CF6]
!*Ach! Burning with a Dose! Get you gone!

Id: [0x00086CF8]
!*Would you lend us a Silver Crown, Sir? Or a couple o' Reales if you've Heart enough?

Id: [0x00086CFC]
!*It’s your Turn at the Oars.

Id: [0x00086CFD]
!*The Devil it is. I rowed last time.

Id: [0x00086CFE]
!*Aye, and wagered your next Turn on a poor Hand of Cards, as I recall.

Id: [0x00086CFF]
!*Blast! So I did. [Loud sigh]

Id: [0x00086D01]
!*Come on then. The Captain’s waiting.

Id: [0x00086D04]
!*The Fireship's gone off her Heading, Captain. Follow her close on!

Id: [0x00086D05]
!*Follow the Fire Ship!

Id: [0x00086D09]
!*Tell me about Edward Teach. What sort of man is he?

Id: [0x00086D0A]
!*It's Thatch, Sir. Least, that's what he calls himself. But he's a mad Bugger, he is. Cracked as a glass Teapot, Sir.

Id: [0x00086D0B]
!*Details man! Stop talking in gibberish.

Id: [0x00086D0C]
!*Well sir, he likes his Drink for Instance. Only he makes 'em queer. Takes the usual Rum Flip, and fills it with half a Weight of Gunpowder to top it off.

Id: [0x00086D0D]
!*Did I hear you aright? He DRINKS Gunpowder?

Id: [0x00086D0E]
!*Aye, Sir. Just for Show.

Id: [0x00086D0F]
!*And only last Week he rounded up a Score of his Crew and bade us sit in the Hold of his Ship while he burnt off Sulfur and other sickening Minerals. We just sat there like it was one of a million pits of Hell, and nothing less ordinary.

Id: [0x00086D10]
!*Good GOD. What the Hell for?

Id: [0x00086D11]
!*Liked to test his Crew is all. Tease out their Fitness and what. 'Course it always turned out he was the fittest of the Lot.

Id: [0x00086D14]
!*She’s spooked, Captain! The Slaver’s Ship is running!

Id: [0x00086D15]
!*Damned Fool! I’ll get us in close!

Id: [0x00086D18]
!*Up ahead! They're unloading something from that Ship!

Id: [0x00086D19]
!*Could that be our Prize?

Id: [0x00086D1C]
!*I can bring the Jackdaw closer, but those lookouts will be a Problem.

Id: [0x00086D1D]
!*Well spotted. I'll clear them off first

Id: [0x00086D22]
!*Under Attack once more. Come.

Id: [0x00086D23]
!*To the Beach!

Id: [0x00086D24]
!*Stay close, Edward. Follow my Lead.

Id: [0x00086D25]
!*So many dead... so many injured!

Id: [0x00086D26]
!*Edward! Find the Man who led this Attack. Finish him off!

Id: [0x00086D27]
!*That Coward is hiding aboard his Ship.

Id: [0x00086D28]
!*Good to see you here, Breddah!

{553143}{553143}{553143}Hello, I'm Mr. Murphy.

Id: [0x000870BB]
{553147}{553147}{553147}Please! I don't have any more money!

Id: [0x000870BC]
{553148}{553148}{553148}Like hell you don't, old man.

Id: [0x000870C1]
Now what are you going on about?

Id: [0x000870C2]
{553154}{553154}{553154}That doesn't sound right.

Id: [0x000870C3]
!*Hello, meet my friends!

Id: [0x000870C4]
!*Cave Johnson here. No wait, I'm William Johnson.

Id: [0x000870C5]
!*And I'm George Monro, no E, just O.

Id: [0x000870C6]
!*You guys look familiar... could you be... TEMPLARS?!?

Id: [0x000870C7]
!*Don't be silly, we're...

Id: [0x000870C8]
!*Shriners! That's it, Shriners! With little cars and funny hats and everything.

Id: [0x000870C9]
{553161}{553161}{553161}That's not good enough, Shay.

Id: [0x000870CA]
{553162}{553162}{553162}Come out and say it, Liam. I'm not good enough. None of us are good enough for you.

Id: [0x000870CC]
{553164}{553164}{553164}You don’t understand, Shay, I’m not just some girl you can talk sweet to. I’ve got responsibilities. This town would tear itself to pieces without me.

Id: [0x000870CD]
{553165}{553165}{553165}But that’s just because you set everybody at each others’ throats!

Id: [0x000870CF]
{553167}{553167}{553167}(FR)N'avez vous pas entendu dire, que Dieu aide toûjours aux fous, aux amoureux, et aux ivrognes?

Id: [0x000870D0]
{553168}{553168}{553168}And what's that supposed to mean?

Id: [0x000870D1]
{553169}{553169}{553169}Haven't you heard that God always helps fools, lovers, and drunkards? I believe that's the only reason you're still alive, Shay.

Id: [0x000870D2]
{553170}{553170}{553170}I thought it was because the good Lord had sent me as your scourge, Cap'n Joseph.

Id: [0x000870D4]
It has been a long time.

Id: [0x000870D5]
Very poorly, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x000870D6]
Your countenance tells me we should discuss this.

Id: [0x000870D9]
And the artifacts that showed the way?

Id: [0x000870DB]
Tell me what happened, old friend.

Id: [0x000870DD]
It was terrible, Achilles. The ground shook, and the ocean waves crashed over Port-au-Prince...

Id: [0x000870DE]
How many were lost?

Id: [0x000870DF]
Thousands. No family was left untouched.

Id: [0x000870E0]
I hate to bring up practical matters at a time like this, but did Mackandal's man complete his task before the earthquake hit?

Id: [0x000870E1]
I cannot know. Vendredi has not been found. He was a strong Maroon, one of Mackandal's best students.

Id: [0x000870E2]
Stolen. The Templars broke in during the chaos. They seized the Manuscript and Precursor box. I gave chase on the sea, but lost their trail when they reached New York.

Id: [0x000870E3]
We must consider what to do next.

Id: [0x000870E5]
{553189}{553189}{553189}Find and hunt a prey.

Id: [0x000870E7]
{553191}{553191}{553191}Good work bringing back Adéwalé, Shay.

Id: [0x000870E8]
{553192}{553192}{553192}Thank you, Mentor.

Id: [0x000870E9]
{553193}{553193}{553193}Now that you are here, you should take some time to train. I've instructed your fellow Assassins to make things challenging for you.

Id: [0x000870EA]
{553194}{553194}{553194}I'd be disappointed if you didn't, sir.

Id: [0x000870EB]
{553195}{553195}{553195}Good! Now get going.

Id: [0x000870EE]
{553198}{553198}{553198}Kesegowaase! Achilles said I should see you for training. What would you have me do?

Id: [0x000870F0]
{553200}{553200}{553200}A raccoon.

Id: [0x000870F1]
{553201}{553201}{553201}I'll make myself a hat.

Id: [0x000870F4]
{553204}{553204}{553204}Far be it from me to keep a lady waiting.

Id: [0x000870F5]
{553205}{553205}{553205}I'm no lady here, and don't you forget it! I'm your teacher...(smirking) and your better.

Id: [0x000870F6]
{553206}{553206}{553206}Well some of that is true, at least.(beat) What will we be doing?

Id: [0x000870F9]
{553209}{553209}{553209}Ah, Shay. You darken my deck once more.

Id: [0x000870FA]
{553210}{553210}{553210}I knew salt water had gotten into your brains, Shay, but I didn't think they'd rotted through, yet.

Id: [0x000870FD]
{553213}{553213}{553213}Ready for another whipping, Liam?

Id: [0x000870FE]
{553214}{553214}{553214}Oh, they're not half as pickled as yours.

Id: [0x000870FF]
{553215}{553215}{553215}That smart mouth will be the death of you.

Id: [0x00087103]
{553219}{553219}{553219}Aye, Captain Joseph. I'm a regular black cat. Got any treats for pussy?

Id: [0x00087104]
{553220}{553220}{553220}As a matter of fact, I do. Ten-pound treats.

Id: [0x0008710A]
{553226}{553226}{553226}Come to join your Grand Master in the hereafter?

Id: [0x0008710B]
{553227}{553227}{553227}Forgive me for hurrying you to Judgment Day, Adéwalé.

Id: [0x0008710C]
{553228}{553228}{553228}You dare speak to me of judgment, boy? Hell has a special level for traitors.

Id: [0x0008710D]
{553229}{553229}{553229}Then I go there proudly, knowing I have done right.

Id: [0x00087111]
{553233}{553233}{553233}Then I will kill every last one of them, if I must. I cannot let you succeed.

Id: [0x00087112]
{553234}{553234}{553234}You have become a monster, boy.

Id: [0x00087113]
{553235}{553235}{553235}Perhaps I have. May the Lord judge you more kindly than he’ll judge me.

Id: [0x00087114]
{553236}{553236}{553236}First, we need to get that signal. Then we use it at various French positions.

Id: [0x00087116]
{553238}{553238}{553238}No. Now go out there and try not to get killed.

Id: [0x00087121]
{553249}{553249}{553249}Behold the last death throes of the French on this continent.

Id: [0x00087122]
{553250}{553250}{553250}Aren't you being a worrywart, Haytham? The war is all but won! Long live King George and all.

Id: [0x00087123]
{553251}{553251}{553251}I wouldn't put anything beyond these Gallic schemers...(pointing to the man-o-war) For example, what do you make of that?

Id: [0x00087125]
{553253}{553253}{553253}(low whistle)Well ain't she a beauty!

Id: [0x00087126]
{553254}{553254}{553254}That makes no sense. Those rivers barely have enough draft for an oceangoing vessel. She'll be nearly impossible to maneuver.

Id: [0x00087127]
{553255}{553255}{553255}I don't think maneuverability is the point.

Id: [0x00087128]
{553256}{553256}{553256}Look!

Id: [0x0008712A]
{553258}{553258}{553258}May the Father of Understanding have mercy on their souls.

Id: [0x0008712C]
{553260}{553260}{553260}Indeed.(pause) We could use that.

Id: [0x00087130]
{553264}{553264}{553264}Shay!

Id: [0x00087131]
So what’s the next city you want me to smite?

Id: [0x00087132]
{553266}{553266}{553266}Excuse me?

Id: [0x00087133]
{553267}{553267}{553267}What on earth are you talking about, Shay?

Id: [0x00087134]
{553268}{553268}{553268}Ask him.

Id: [0x00087135]
{553269}{553269}{553269}I’m sure I have no idea.

Id: [0x00087136]
What happened in Haiti happened in Portugal. A great earthquake. Thousands dead, thanks to your damned Manuscript.

Id: [0x00087137]
This cannot be.

Id: [0x00087138]
{553272}{553272}{553272}It can.(beat) I know what your damned Manuscript shows. It’s a map of powder barrels... and I threw the torch.

Id: [0x00087139]
Shay, a person cannot start an earthquake.

Id: [0x0008713A]
A person meddling with these Precursor machines could. You saw the Box, Hope. The Temple was filled to bursting with that kind of power.

Id: [0x0008713B]
{553275}{553275}{553275}Calm yourself.

Id: [0x0008713C]
You made me SLAUGHTER INNOCENTS!

Id: [0x0008713D]
How dare you!

Id: [0x0008713E]
You defend him? Achilles sent me in there like Mackandal sent his man in Haiti.[pointing a finger at Achilles] He knew.

Id: [0x00087140]
What the hell’s going on? Stop this!

Id: [0x00087142]
The operation was delicate, perhaps you--

Id: [0x00087144]
{553284}{553284}{553284}You bastard!

Id: [0x00087146]
You are shifting the earth itself. Who are you to decide what city falls next?

Id: [0x00087147]
{553287}{553287}{553287}Calm down!

Id: [0x00087148]
{553288}{553288}{553288}You can’t truly believe Achilles wanted this. It’s against everything we stand for.

Id: [0x00087149]
Get him out of here.

Id: [0x0008714E]
{553294}{553294}{553294}Get off of me!

Id: [0x00087155]
{553301}{553301}{553301}This has gone too far.

Id: [0x00087156]
{553302}{553302}{553302}You’re right. It has.

Id: [0x00087158]
{553304}{553304}{553304}And I know what I have to do now.

Id: [0x0008715D]
[sigh]There's no turning back now...

Id: [0x0008715F]
I had such hopes for you, Shay.

Id: [0x00087160]
Achilles.[beat] I have to do this.

Id: [0x00087161]
And what is it you’re doing exactly? Stealing from your Brothers? Betraying me?

Id: [0x00087162]
Someone must make amends.

Id: [0x00087164]
Make amends?[beat] You have no idea what you're doing! The future of the whole continent, maybe the whole world, is tied up in that Manuscript.

Id: [0x00087165]
{553317}{553317}{553317}You are right... I have learned much from you. One lesson... One lesson I remember particularly well.

Id: [0x00087166]
{553318}{553318}{553318}And what lesson would that be?

Id: [0x00087167]
{553319}{553319}{553319}You once said that we must carry the weight of our decisions.

Id: [0x00087168]
{553320}{553320}{553320}I wanted you to grow up!

Id: [0x00087169]
{553321}{553321}{553321}Grow up. I have, haven’t I? I did not know what I was doing near Lisbon. But I am responsible for this catastrophe. And so are you.

Id: [0x0008716A]
{553322}{553322}{553322}I will not let you destroy everything I have worked for. I will not let you steal the Manuscript!

Id: [0x0008716B]
{553323}{553323}{553323}You should be proud of me, Achilles. After all these years, I’ve finally learned my lesson.

Id: [0x0008716D]
{553325}{553325}{553325}Assassins! Stop him! Stop Shay!

Id: [0x0008716E]
{553326}{553326}{553326}You're mad if you think we can move about this land without risk from that juggernaut!

Id: [0x0008716F]
{553327}{553327}{553327}Maybe we can reduce that risk with a careful approach. I've been scouting around and found a narrow, frozen river that leads around behind the French positions.

Id: [0x00087170]
{553328}{553328}{553328}That's all well and good, but how do we get our hands on that signal?

Id: [0x00087172]
{553330}{553330}{553330}Forget I asked.

Id: [0x00087173]
{553331}{553331}{553331}I suppose I get no say in this.

Id: [0x00087177]
{553335}{553335}{553335}Now to find that signal.

Id: [0x00087183]
{553347}{553347}{553347}I knew you were a sentimental man at heart!

Id: [0x00087184]
{553348}{553348}{553348}Nonsense. But if you die, I'll have to take care of this myself.

Id: [0x00087185]
{553349}{553349}{553349}Hmm, French soldiers don't move like that. I wonder if Liam trained you, Assassin.

Id: [0x0008718C]
{553356}{553356}{553356}I got the signal.

Id: [0x0008718D]
{553357}{553357}{553357}Good. Now we can hoist the French by their own petard.

Id: [0x0008718E]
{553358}{553358}{553358}Let's sail for the French fort. I've plotted a course for us.

Id: [0x0008718F]
{553359}{553359}{553359}I'd better make myself scarce.

Id: [0x00087192]
{553362}{553362}{553362}May the Lord have mercy on their souls.

Id: [0x00087198]
{553368}{553368}{553368}It's been taken care of. Now, can we move on to our real target?

Id: [0x00087199]
{553369}{553369}{553369}Are you questioning my tactics?

Id: [0x0008719A]
{553370}{553370}{553370}I didn't sign up for the Royal British Navy.

Id: [0x0008719B]
{553371}{553371}{553371}Someday, you may be a leader of men. You may make the decisions as to who dies first and who is spared. But today is not that day.

Id: [0x0008719C]
{553372}{553372}{553372}Might I suggest we move to stop Adéwalé?

Id: [0x0008719D]
{553373}{553373}{553373}Yes. I believe our new recruit is particularly eager to sink tugboat captain Adéwalé.

Id: [0x0008719E]
{553374}{553374}{553374}I would...(calming down, thinking better of his words) Yes, let's do that.

Id: [0x000871A3]
{553379}{553379}{553379}There's the cannons. The tow ships will be in their sights any time now.

Id: [0x000871A6]
{553382}{553382}{553382}So it's cat and mouse now is it Adéwalé? So be it.

Id: [0x000871A9]
{553385}{553385}{553385}We have to catch up with Adéwalé.

Id: [0x000871AA]
{553386}{553386}{553386}Well that's a bit of trouble.

Id: [0x000871AB]
{553387}{553387}{553387}I'll go after him.

Id: [0x000871AC]
{553388}{553388}{553388}No. (pause) We go together.

Id: [0x000871AD]
{553389}{553389}{553389}Grand Master, are you sure that's wise?

Id: [0x000871AE]
{553390}{553390}{553390}I have... history with this man. I will make sure his final chapter is written.

Id: [0x000871B0]
{553392}{553392}{553392}We should split up and meet onboard.

Id: [0x000871B5]
{553397}{553397}{553397}That's not good enough, Shay.

Id: [0x000871B7]
{553399}{553399}{553399}If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, no roughhousing on the deck! And the next time one of you calls me Captain Joseph, you'll be eating your own teeth. I'm [FR]Capitaine Louis-Joseph Gauthier, Chevalier de La Verendrye.

Id: [0x000871B8]
{553400}{553400}{553400}Sorry Chevalier.

Id: [0x000871B9]
{553401}{553401}{553401}Sorry...(quietly) you stuck-up garlic-eating frog.

Id: [0x000871BA]
{553402}{553402}{553402}WHAT? First, I am [FR]Canadien, not French.

Id: [0x000871BB]
{553403}{553403}{553403}So a frozen frog, then.

Id: [0x000871BC]
{553404}{553404}{553404}Shay!

Id: [0x000871BD]
{553405}{553405}{553405}THAT'S ENOUGH, [FR]PUTAIN DE MERDE!

Id: [0x000871C1]
{553409}{553409}{553409}Shay...

Id: [0x000871C4]
Feast of All Saints, what a sight. And here I am, looking for a relic from the time before Adam and Eve... Strange days indeed.

Id: [0x000871C5]
{553413}{553413}{553413}One of them was near Haiti. We sent a young man to investigate, but his ill-fortuned voyage was interrupted by an earthquake.

Id: [0x000871CA]
Stay out of this, you fool!

Id: [0x000871CB]
Well I was going to but, now you've made things personal...

Id: [0x000871CD]
Aaarrgghh! And don't come back! Thank you, Shay. In me younger days, I could have taken them one-handed!

Id: [0x000871CF]
{553423}{553423}{553423}[FR]A vos armes! To arms!

Id: [0x000871D2]
{553426}{553426}{553426}Adéwalé, who as you know is late arrived from Haiti, can tell you more.

Id: [0x000871D4]
{553428}{553428}{553428}I hesitate to burden you with details, but I must share with you some matters of grave concern for both this Colonial Brotherhood, and our brothers around the world.

Id: [0x000871D5]
{553429}{553429}{553429}What is the matter, Mentor?

Id: [0x000871D6]
{553430}{553430}{553430}A set of powerful artifacts from the First Civilization has been stolen, and I am afraid they are in the hands of the Templars.

Id: [0x000871D8]
{553432}{553432}{553432}Thank you, Achilles. The Haitian Brotherhood recently found a manuscript of great importance. We believe it was dictated, or at least inspired, by Those Who Came Before.

Id: [0x000871D9]
{553433}{553433}{553433}What's written in it?

Id: [0x000871DA]
{553434}{553434}{553434}Many things. It is full of signs and symbols we cannot completely interpret yet. But so far we can understand one thing, a map.

Id: [0x000871DB]
{553435}{553435}{553435}This map shows sites of power found, or founded, by the First Civilization. Temples, as it were. We believe these sites contain power to affect the very planet itself.

Id: [0x000871DC]
{553436}{553436}{553436}We can only assume that the temple located at that spot was terribly damaged by the earthquake. We must move on to the other locations... But the map and its associated artifacts are missing.

Id: [0x000871DD]
{553437}{553437}{553437}Associated artifacts?

Id: [0x000871DE]
{553438}{553438}{553438}There is a box, another gift from Those Who Came Before, that lets us read the manuscript clearly. And a core that provides energy to bring the box to life. But that core is not only lost, it is broken, shattered in the earthquake.

Id: [0x000871DF]
{553439}{553439}{553439}So even though the Templars have this manuscript and box, they're missing the heart that lets them understand what they have?

Id: [0x000871E0]
{553440}{553440}{553440}Yes, but not necessarily for long. The world is full of strange things, both from the First Civilization and men's minds. We can't assume they won't find a way to make the manuscript clear again.

Id: [0x000871E2]
!*Wait, there's plenty of Precursor power sources around. What about the one in Brazil that Desmond found? Or Egypt, or one of the others? Why don't they just fetch one of those?

Id: [0x000871E3]
!*Because these people don't know those exist yet, Rebecca. Remember, even Grand Master Haytham couldn't figure out how to power up a First Civilization site. And even if they did know, who's to say that a power source powerful enough to light up a whole temple wouldn't vaporize this interpretation box?

Id: [0x000871E4]
!*Hmm, you're probably right.

Id: [0x000871E5]
!*Of course I am.

Id: [0x000871E6]
!*And certainly arrogant.

Id: [0x000871E7]
!*I prefer, "confident in my intellectual prowess."

Id: [0x000871E8]
{553448}{553448}{553448}That is why we must stop the Templars and retrieve the artifacts. We cannot risk them finding and controlling these temples.

Id: [0x000871EA]
!*Shaun, do our records contain anything about temples like that?

Id: [0x000871EB]
!*They don't. And that worries me.

Id: [0x000871EC]
!*We do know that these are the last days of the Colonial Assassins, the final months before Achilles' downfall... but we still don't know why that happened. All records from that era were destroyed or lost, and Achilles certainly never explained his failures to Connor.

Id: [0x000871ED]
!*Perhaps the Templars know more about this point in Assassin history than we do.

Id: [0x000871EE]
!*Keep going. These memories may be more critical than we imagined.

Id: [0x000871F3]
{553459}{553459}{553459}There's a route straight ahead, just keep following the main branch of the river.

Id: [0x000871F8]
Oh, the usual. They feel they're owed money because they’re NOT harming citizens. Mark me words, those gangs are going to be the downfall of this city.

Id: [0x000871F9]
{553465}{553465}{553465}What are you doing out of bed, you daft child!

Id: [0x000871FA]
{553466}{553466}{553466}Yes, of course...

Id: [0x000871FC]
Huh, good to see you're feeling better.

Id: [0x000871FD]
Thank you... Mister Finnegan, was it?

Id: [0x000871FF]
Sweet Mother Mary, have we taken in the village idiot?

Id: [0x00087200]
Barry!

Id: [0x00087201]
Remember Shay, I'm Cassidy and this is...<br>

Id: [0x00087202]
I hate to have been a burden.

Id: [0x00087203]
See, he's a civilized fellow.

Id: [0x00087204]
Aye for a clumsy deckhand. Probably fell off his ship half-drunk.

Id: [0x00087205]
BARRY!

Id: [0x00087206]
{553478}{553478}{553478}No, Mrs. Finnegan, he's likely right. I have been in that state far too often.

Id: [0x00087207]
{553479}{553479}{553479}I'm sure you're wrong, sweetheart. And you can call me Casey.

Id: [0x00087208]
{553480}{553480}{553480}And you can call her Casey.

Id: [0x00087209]
{553481}{553481}{553481}Barry, don't you be insinuating no nonsense!

Id: [0x0008720A]
{553482}{553482}{553482}I ain't insinuating nothing! You're chatting up a fellow a tenth of your age. Why don't you offer him a teat while you're at it?

Id: [0x0008720B]
He's right...

Id: [0x0008720C]
{553484}{553484}{553484}Wait here. I have something for you.

Id: [0x0008720E]
Won't do you any good walking around starkers... Here, try these on.[sadly] They were our son's.

Id: [0x0008720F]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00087211]
Ah, don't you look a right gentleman!

Id: [0x00087212]
{553490}{553490}{553490}Wait, there's this too.

Id: [0x00087214]
I suppose if you're looking for trouble, you'll be needing these.

Id: [0x00087216]
{553494}{553494}{553494}Thank you, for everything.

Id: [0x00087218]
Did I have a book with me?

Id: [0x0008721A]
Hmm... Just those peculiar weapons.

Id: [0x0008721B]
Thank you both.[beat] If you'll excuse me.

Id: [0x0008721C]
Then the Manuscript is at the bottom of the Atlantic...

Id: [0x00087222]
!*Behold the last death throes of the French on this continent.

Id: [0x00087223]
!*The war goes poorly for the French, but King Louis insists his armies keep as much land as they can hold. We cannot assume the British will be victorious.

Id: [0x00087224]
!*Aren't you being a worrywart, Haytham? The war is all but won! Long live King George and all.

Id: [0x00087225]
!*I wouldn't put anything beyond these Gallic schemers... For example, what do you make of that?

Id: [0x00087227]
!*(low whistle) Well ain't she a beauty!

Id: [0x00087228]
!*That makes no sense. Those rivers barely have enough draft for an oceangoing vessel. She'll be nearly impossible to maneuver.

Id: [0x00087229]
!*I don't think maneuverability is the point.

Id: [0x0008722A]
!*Look!

Id: [0x0008722C]
!*May the Father of Understanding have mercy on their souls.

Id: [0x0008722D]
!*Indeed. (pause) We could use that.

Id: [0x0008722E]
!*What are you thinking of, Haytham?

Id: [0x0008722F]
!*First, we need to get that signal. Then we use it at various French positions.

Id: [0x00087230]
!*You're mad if you think we can move about this land without risk from that juggernaut!

Id: [0x00087231]
!*Maybe we can reduce that risk with a careful approach. I've been scouting around and found a narrow, frozen river that leads around behind the French positions.

Id: [0x00087232]
!*That's all well and good, but how do we get our hands on that signal?

Id: [0x00087234]
!*Forget I asked.

Id: [0x00087237]
!*This will be a good test of your navigational skills.

Id: [0x00087238]
!*With all due respect, Haytham, I was sailing for years before I met you.

Id: [0x00087239]
!*I get the distinct impression that “with all due respect” is Irish for “shut your gob”.

Id: [0x0008723A]
!*You never told me you spoke Irish!

Id: [0x0008723D]
!*Now to find that Assassin.

Id: [0x0008723F]
!*That must be him. You can change your clothes, friend, but Redcoats don't move like that.

Id: [0x00087241]
!*(monotone, as if it's a password) May the wisdom of Altaïr guide you.

Id: [0x00087242]
!*May the Father of Understanding guide you.

Id: [0x00087245]
!*I got the signal.

Id: [0x00087246]
!*Good. Now we can hoist the French by their own petard.

Id: [0x00087247]
!*Let's sail for the first target site. I've plotted a course through the ice.

Id: [0x0008724A]
!*I suppose I get no say in this.

Id: [0x0008724B]
!*No. Now go out there and try not to get killed.

Id: [0x0008724C]
!*I knew you were a sentimental man at heart!

Id: [0x0008724D]
!*Nonsense. I just know that if you die, I'll have to take care of this myself.

Id: [0x00087250]
!*Time to move.

Id: [0x00087252]
!*May the Lord have mercy on their souls.

Id: [0x00087254]
!*It's been taken care of.

Id: [0x00087255]
!*Well done. Let's move along and see if we can't get another shot out of this blunderbuss.

Id: [0x00087258]
!*Well, that first one went well enough... Let's see how this turns out.

Id: [0x0008725A]
!*This seems as good a spot as any.

Id: [0x0008725C]
!*I'd better make myself scarce.

Id: [0x0008725F]
!*It's done. Now, can we move on to our real target?

Id: [0x00087260]
!*Are you questioning my tactics?

Id: [0x00087261]
!*And if I am?

Id: [0x00087262]
!*Someday, you may be a leader of men. You may make the decisions as to who dies first and who is spared. But today is not that day.

Id: [0x00087263]
!*The tow ships are moving the man-o-war out of range. Might I suggest we stop them?

Id: [0x00087264]
!*Yes. I believe our new recruit is particularly eager to sink tugboat captain Adéwalé.

Id: [0x00087265]
!*(Taking offense) I would... (calming down, thinking better of his words) Yes, let's do that.

Id: [0x00087266]
!*There are French cannons posted along the convoy's route, for their protection.

Id: [0x00087267]
!*Let's put those to better use, shall we?

Id: [0x0008726A]
!*There's the cannons. The tow ships will be in their sights any time now.

Id: [0x0008726D]
!*So it's cat and mouse now is it Adéwalé? So be it.

Id: [0x00087270]
!*Haytham Kenway? The Templar Grand Master himself is chasing me? I must have caused quite a ruckus.

Id: [0x00087271]
!*Adéwalé. Indeed, you have been a thorn in our side for long enough.

Id: [0x00087272]
!*I served with your father, Haytham. He would be ashamed to see what you have become.

Id: [0x00087273]
!*I wasn’t aware he had a sense of shame.

Id: [0x00087274]
!*Do not speak ill of your father, boy! If you become half the man he was it will be a blessing.

Id: [0x00087275]
!*Blessing or curse, I am my own man. And I do this for my own Order. [attacks]

Id: [0x00087278]
!*We have to catch up with Adéwalé.

Id: [0x00087279]
!*There's a route straight ahead, just keep following the main branch of the river.

Id: [0x0008727E]
!*Well that's a bit of trouble.

Id: [0x0008727F]
!*I'll go after him.

Id: [0x00087280]
!*No. (pause) We go together.

Id: [0x00087281]
!*Grand Master, are you sure that's wise?

Id: [0x00087282]
!*I have... history with this man. I will make sure his final chapter is written.

Id: [0x00087284]
!*We should split up and meet onboard.

Id: [0x00087289]
!*You could have been one of us, Haytham. An Assassin, free and proud.

Id: [0x0008728A]
!*Are you really so free, Adéwalé? I think you’ve traded one set of chains for another.

Id: [0x0008728C]
!*So, show me this courtesy: tell me who will take your place when I have killed you.

Id: [0x0008728D]
!*(taking heart at seeing SHAY approaching) I’ve no intention of being courteous, or killed.

Id: [0x00087290]
{553616}{553616}{553616}Come to join your Grand Master in the hereafter?

Id: [0x00087291]
{553617}{553617}{553617}Forgive me for hurrying you to Judgment Day, Adéwalé.

Id: [0x00087292]
{553618}{553618}{553618}You dare speak to me of judgment, boy? Hell has a special level for traitors.

Id: [0x00087293]
{553619}{553619}{553619}Then I go there proudly, knowing I have done right.

Id: [0x00087296]
{553622}{553622}{553622}It doesn't matter... The Assassins already have what they need.

Id: [0x00087297]
{553623}{553623}{553623}Then I will kill every last one of them, if I must. I cannot let you succeed.

Id: [0x00087298]
{553624}{553624}{553624}You have become a monster, boy.

Id: [0x00087299]
{553625}{553625}{553625}Perhaps I have. May the Lord judge you more kindly than he’ll judge me.

Id: [0x000872A0]
{553632}{553632}{553632}Who is this man?

Id: [0x000872A1]
{553633}{553633}{553633}Adéwalé.

Id: [0x000872A2]
{553634}{553634}{553634}Adaywah-who?

Id: [0x000872A3]
{553635}{553635}{553635}The formidable Adéwalé. My father sometimes spoke of his feats of strength and cunning. Though he’d always disguise it as some kind of tall tale...

Id: [0x000872A4]
{553636}{553636}{553636}Why was that?

Id: [0x000872A5]
{553637}{553637}{553637}Because he didn’t want me tempted to follow the wayward path of his life, I suppose.

Id: [0x000872A6]
{553638}{553638}{553638}As an Assassin?

Id: [0x000872A7]
{553639}{553639}{553639}As a pirate.

Id: [0x000872A8]
{553640}{553640}{553640}You would have made a good pirate.

Id: [0x000872AA]
{553642}{553642}{553642}Full stop, bring the ship around, sharply!

Id: [0x000872AB]
{553643}{553643}{553643}The French fort is just up that cliff. You could reach it if you climb the masts.

Id: [0x000872AC]
{553644}{553644}{553644}But what about those tow ships?

Id: [0x000872AD]
{553645}{553645}{553645}We're trapped here!

Id: [0x000872AE]
{553646}{553646}{553646}We can get around this, but it will take some time.

Id: [0x000872B0]
{553648}{553648}{553648}Shay can take care of them after he blows up the fort.

Id: [0x000872B1]
{553649}{553649}{553649}Right. Fort first, then the tow ships.

Id: [0x000872B2]
{553650}{553650}{553650}I should get as close to the center as possible.

Id: [0x000872BA]
{553658}{553658}{553658}One down, one to go.

Id: [0x000872BC]
{553660}{553660}{553660}That's the second. Now to call the Morrigan and go after Adéwalé.

Id: [0x000872C3]
{553667}{553667}{553667}Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were the expert on the ebb and flow of this war. Is there some reason why Templar and British goals are at odds?

Id: [0x000872CC]
{553676}{553676}{553676}Adéwalé's vessel has moved ahead and entered a lake.

Id: [0x000872CD]
{553677}{553677}{553677}Let's follow him then, shall we?

Id: [0x000872CF]
{553679}{553679}{553679}The man-o-war is right on our tail!

Id: [0x000872D0]
{553680}{553680}{553680}I didn't want such a close look at her!

Id: [0x000872D1]
{553681}{553681}{553681}Full speed ahead!

Id: [0x000872D4]
!*So where do you plan to sail after this, Master Cook?

Id: [0x000872D5]
!*To the southeast, sir.

Id: [0x000872D6]
!*As far as India?

Id: [0x000872D7]
!*Oh, much farther.

Id: [0x000872D8]
!*Are you to be a Magellan then, sailing right ‘round the world?

Id: [0x000872D9]
!*Perhaps I will! Are you interested in exploration, Master Gist?

Id: [0x000872DA]
!*Of course! One time, I visited Bermuda, and sipped punch with the officers’ daughters.

Id: [0x000872DC]
!*So, what you’re saying is you explore for women and alcohol?

Id: [0x000872DD]
!*Well, yes. What better treasures are there to seek?

Id: [0x000872DE]
!*What about knowledge? Cartography? Trade routes and new peoples and appreciating this world as the Lord’s wondrous creation?

Id: [0x000872DF]
!*Oh, I enjoy the Lord’s creations, Master Cook, I just prefer those suited for drinking or(pause) dancing.

Id: [0x000872E0]
!*You are a miscreant and a reprobate, Master Gist.

Id: [0x000872E1]
!*I’m glad I don’t know what those mean, or else I might be insulted.

Id: [0x000872E8]
{553704}{553704}{553704}I'll go after him.

Id: [0x000872E9]
{553705}{553705}{553705}No.(pause) We go together.

Id: [0x000872EA]
{553706}{553706}{553706}Master Kenway, are you sure that's wise?

Id: [0x000872EB]
{553707}{553707}{553707}I have... history with this man. I will make sure his final chapter is written.

Id: [0x000872EC]
{553708}{553708}{553708}Give him hell, Sir! You too Shay!

Id: [0x000872ED]
{553709}{553709}{553709}Hold her together while we're gone, Gist!

Id: [0x000872EE]
{553710}{553710}{553710}I know the drill!

Id: [0x000872F1]
{553713}{553713}{553713}I'll sink this ship if you don't give me what I need!

Id: [0x000872F5]
{553717}{553717}{553717}Haytham, Shay. The Templar Grand Master and his puppet. I must have caused quite a ruckus for both of you to be chasing me.

Id: [0x000872F6]
{553718}{553718}{553718}Adéwalé. Indeed, you have been a thorn in our side long enough.

Id: [0x000872F7]
{553719}{553719}{553719}I served with your father, Haytham. He would be ashamed to see what you have become.

Id: [0x000872F8]
{553720}{553720}{553720}I wasn’t aware he had a sense of shame.

Id: [0x000872F9]
{553721}{553721}{553721}Do not speak ill of your father, boy! If you become half the man he was it will be a blessing.

Id: [0x000872FA]
{553722}{553722}{553722}Blessing or curse, I am my own man.

Id: [0x000872FC]
{553724}{553724}{553724}Forgive me for hurrying you to Judgment Day, Adéwalé.

Id: [0x000872FD]
{553725}{553725}{553725}You dare speak to me of judgment, boy? Hell has a special level for traitors.

Id: [0x000872FE]
{553726}{553726}{553726}Then I go there proudly, knowing I have done right.

Id: [0x000872FF]
{553727}{553727}{553727}It doesn't matter... Achilles already has what he needs.

Id: [0x00087300]
{553728}{553728}{553728}Then I will kill every last man who defends him, if I must. I cannot let him succeed.

Id: [0x00087301]
{553729}{553729}{553729}You... have become... a monster, boy.

Id: [0x00087302]
{553730}{553730}{553730}Perhaps I have. May the Lord judge you more kindly than he’ll judge me.

Id: [0x00087308]
{553736}{553736}{553736}No. I began this, I will end it.

Id: [0x0008730C]
!*You could have been one of us, Haytham. An Assassin, free and proud.

Id: [0x0008730D]
!*Are you really so free, Adéwalé? I think you’ve traded one set of chains for another.

Id: [0x0008730F]
!*So, show me this courtesy: tell me who will take your place when I have killed you.

Id: [0x00087310]
!*(taking heart at seeing SHAY approaching) I’ve no intention of being courteous, or killed.

Id: [0x00087311]
!*Oh! The daughters of which officers? I know many men who have been stationed in Bermuda.

Id: [0x00087312]
!*A gentleman never tells, Master Cook! I'm surprised at you.

Id: [0x00087313]
!*I... I meant nothing wrong by it.

Id: [0x00087314]
!*I'm sure you didn't. I’ve been to Quebec a few times too. There’s a tavern where I can practice my French with many [FR]belles dames who just keep serving me [FR]eau de vie.

Id: [0x00087315]
!*Such a tragedy about General Wolfe. At least the Marquis de Montcalm left this world as well.

Id: [0x00087316]
!*Strange, he looked perfectly healthy at Fort William Henry.

Id: [0x00087317]
!*I imagine you take little interest in the SMALL DETAILS of war, sir.

Id: [0x00087318]
!*You can't expect me to remember EVERYTHING!

Id: [0x00087319]
!*Well, I do remember sailing around São Paulo. I made the acquaintance of a lady named Silvia who runs her late husband’s rum distillery, a most merry widow indeed.

Id: [0x0008731A]
!*I suppose you often remember nothing at all.

Id: [0x0008731E]
{553758}{553758}{553758}But that man-o-war is blocking the way!

Id: [0x0008731F]
{553759}{553759}{553759}It's a tributary, don't worry. We'll get there through the ice.

Id: [0x00087320]
{553760}{553760}{553760}You are mad, sir! Oh well, tally ho!

Id: [0x00087321]
{553761}{553761}{553761}Adéwalé! Come down here and face me like a man!

Id: [0x00087322]
{553762}{553762}{553762}This, from a Templar and traitor? Come up here and face me like an eagle.

Id: [0x00087323]
{553763}{553763}{553763}Forgiveness? Only the Good Lord can give you that, Shay.

Id: [0x00087324]
{553764}{553764}{553764}The power source, Adéwalé! Give it to me!

Id: [0x00087325]
{553765}{553765}{553765}I feel very powerful right here. Leave my ship and I'll let you live another day.

Id: [0x00087326]
!*Someday, you may be a leader of men. You may make the decisions as to who dies first and who is spared. But today is not that day.

Id: [0x00087330]
!*Behold the last death throes of the French on this continent.

Id: [0x00087331]
!*The war goes poorly for the French, but King Louis insists his armies keep as much land as they can hold. We cannot assume the British will be victorious.

Id: [0x00087332]
!*Aren't you being a worrywart, Haytham? The war is all but won! Long live King George and all.

Id: [0x00087333]
!*I wouldn't put anything beyond these Gallic schemers...(pointing to the man-o-war) For example, what do you make of that?

Id: [0x00087335]
!*(low whistle)Well ain't she a beauty!

Id: [0x00087336]
!*That makes no sense. Those rivers barely have enough draft for an oceangoing vessel. She'll be nearly impossible to maneuver.

Id: [0x00087337]
!*I don't think maneuverability is the point.

Id: [0x00087338]
!*Look!

Id: [0x0008733A]
!*May the Father of Understanding have mercy on their souls.

Id: [0x0008733B]
!*Indeed.(pause) We could use that.

Id: [0x0008733C]
!*What are you thinking of, Master Kenway?

Id: [0x0008733D]
!*First, we need to get that signal. Then we use it at various French positions.

Id: [0x0008733E]
!*You're mad if you think we can move about this land without risk from that juggernaut!

Id: [0x0008733F]
!*Maybe we can reduce that risk with a careful approach. I've been scouting around and found a narrow, frozen river that leads around behind the French positions.

Id: [0x00087340]
!*That's all well and good, but how do we get our hands on that signal?

Id: [0x00087342]
!*Forget I asked.

Id: [0x00087345]
!*Now to find that signal.

Id: [0x00087347]
!*Hmm, French soldiers don't move like that. I wonder if Liam trained you, Assassin.

Id: [0x0008734D]
!*I got the signal.

Id: [0x0008734E]
!*Good. Now we can hoist the French by their own petard.

Id: [0x0008734F]
!*Let's sail for the French fort. I've plotted a course for us.

Id: [0x00087350]
!*But that man-o-war is blocking the way!

Id: [0x00087351]
!*It's a tributary, don't worry. We'll get there through the ice.

Id: [0x00087352]
!*You are mad, sir! Oh well, tally ho!

Id: [0x00087358]
!*Full stop, bring the ship around, sharply!

Id: [0x00087359]
!*Who is this man?

Id: [0x0008735A]
!*Adéwalé.

Id: [0x0008735B]
!*Adaywah-who?

Id: [0x0008735C]
!*The formidable Adéwalé. My father sometimes spoke of his feats of strength and cunning. Though he’d always disguise it as some kind of tall tale...

Id: [0x0008735D]
!*Why was that?

Id: [0x0008735E]
!*Because he didn’t want me tempted to follow the wayward path of his life, I suppose.

Id: [0x0008735F]
!*As an Assassin?

Id: [0x00087360]
!*As a pirate.

Id: [0x00087361]
!*You would have made a good pirate.

Id: [0x00087364]
!*We're trapped here!

Id: [0x00087365]
!*We can get around this, but it will take some time.

Id: [0x00087366]
!*The French fort is just up that cliff. You could reach it if you climb the masts.

Id: [0x00087367]
!*I suppose I get no say in this.

Id: [0x00087368]
!*No. Now go out there and try not to get killed.

Id: [0x00087369]
!*I knew you were a sentimental man at heart!

Id: [0x0008736A]
!*Nonsense. But if you die, I'll have to take care of this myself.

Id: [0x0008736B]
!*But what about those tow ships?

Id: [0x0008736C]
!*Shay can take care of them after he blows up the fort.

Id: [0x0008736D]
!*Right. Fort first, then the tow ships.

Id: [0x00087372]
!*I should get as close to the center as possible.

Id: [0x00087374]
!*I'd better make myself scarce.

Id: [0x00087378]
!*May the Lord have mercy on their souls.

Id: [0x0008737C]
!*One down, one to go.

Id: [0x0008737E]
!*That's the second. Now to call the Morrigan and go after Adéwalé.

Id: [0x00087383]
!*It's been taken care of. Now, can we move on to our real target?

Id: [0x00087384]
!*Are you questioning my tactics?

Id: [0x00087385]
!*I didn't sign up for the Royal British Navy.

Id: [0x00087386]
!*Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were the expert on the ebb and flow of this war. Is there some reason why Templar and British goals are at odds?

Id: [0x00087387]
!*Might I suggest we move to stop Adéwalé?

Id: [0x00087388]
!*Yes. I believe our new recruit is particularly eager to sink tugboat captain Adéwalé.

Id: [0x00087389]
!*I would...(calming down, thinking better of his words) Yes, let's do that.

Id: [0x0008738C]
!*Adéwalé's vessel has moved ahead and entered a lake.

Id: [0x0008738D]
!*Let's follow him then, shall we?

Id: [0x0008738F]
!*The man-o-war is right on our tail!

Id: [0x00087390]
!*I didn't want such a close look at her!

Id: [0x00087391]
!*Full speed ahead!

Id: [0x00087396]
!*I'll go after him.

Id: [0x00087397]
!*No.(pause) We go together.

Id: [0x00087398]
!*Master Kenway, are you sure that's wise?

Id: [0x00087399]
!*I have... history with this man. I will make sure his final chapter is written.

Id: [0x0008739A]
!*Give him hell, Sir! You too Shay!

Id: [0x0008739B]
!*Hold her together while we're gone, Gist!

Id: [0x0008739C]
!*I know the drill!

Id: [0x000873A0]
!*Adéwalé! Come down here and face me like a man!

Id: [0x000873A1]
!*This, from a Templar and traitor? Come up here and face me like an eagle.

Id: [0x000873A2]
!*I'll sink this ship if you don't give me what I need!

Id: [0x000873A3]
!*Forgiveness? Only the Good Lord can give you that, Shay.

Id: [0x000873A4]
!*The power source, Adéwalé! Give it to me!

Id: [0x000873A5]
!*I feel very powerful right here. Leave my ship and I'll let you live another day.

Id: [0x000873A8]
!*Haytham, Shay. The Templar Grand Master and his puppet. I must have caused quite a ruckus for both of you to be chasing me.

Id: [0x000873A9]
!*Adéwalé. Indeed, you have been a thorn in our side long enough.

Id: [0x000873AA]
!*I served with your father, Haytham. He would be ashamed to see what you have become.

Id: [0x000873AB]
!*I wasn’t aware he had a sense of shame.

Id: [0x000873AC]
!*Do not speak ill of your father, boy! If you become half the man he was it will be a blessing.

Id: [0x000873AD]
!*Blessing or curse, I am my own man.

Id: [0x000873AF]
!*No. I began this, I will end it.

Id: [0x000873B1]
!*Forgive me for hurrying you to Judgment Day, Adéwalé.

Id: [0x000873B2]
!*You dare speak to me of judgment, boy? Hell has a special level for traitors.

Id: [0x000873B3]
!*Then I go there proudly, knowing I have done right.

Id: [0x000873B4]
!*It doesn't matter... Achilles already has what he needs.

Id: [0x000873B5]
!*Then I will kill every last man who defends him, if I must. I cannot let him succeed.

Id: [0x000873B6]
!*You... have become... a monster, boy.

Id: [0x000873B7]
!*Perhaps I have. May the Lord judge you more kindly than he’ll judge me.

Id: [0x000873E8]
{553960}{553960}{553960}Look what the wind just blew in!

Id: [0x000873E9]
{553961}{553961}{553961}Hail and good morrow, gentlemen!

Id: [0x000873EC]
{553964}{553964}{553964}Ah, Master Cook. Any news?

Id: [0x000873EE]
{553966}{553966}{553966}Actually, I have news so good it could be the headline of the Boston Gazette! I have found the man you were looking for.

Id: [0x000873EF]
{553967}{553967}{553967}Adéwalé?

Id: [0x000873F0]
{553968}{553968}{553968}Exactly. He was last seen in the French fort not two leagues from here, along the river.

Id: [0x000873F1]
{553969}{553969}{553969}What? What would that scallywag doing in a French fort?

Id: [0x000873F2]
{553970}{553970}{553970}Delivering goods, as far as we can tell.

Id: [0x000873F3]
{553971}{553971}{553971}Could he be arming the enemy?

Id: [0x000873F4]
{553972}{553972}{553972}Quite likely.[dismissively] Thank you Master Cook. We'll take it from here.

Id: [0x000873F5]
{553973}{553973}{553973}Farewell and godspeed, gentlemen.

Id: [0x000873F9]
{553977}{553977}{553977}The fort's just up ahead.

Id: [0x000873FA]
{553978}{553978}{553978}Good, then let us continue onward.

Id: [0x000873FC]
So, are you finally gonna tell me what your grudge against this man is?

Id: [0x000873FD]
{553981}{553981}{553981}I am the Grand Master of the Templars.

Id: [0x000873FE]
{553982}{553982}{553982}Come on, sir. You're as twitchy as a three-tailed horse every time we mention the man.

Id: [0x000873FF]
I've known of the formidable Adéwalé all my life. My father sometimes spoke of his feats of strength and cunning. But always under the guise of some sort of tall tale...

Id: [0x00087400]
Why was that?

Id: [0x00087401]
Because he didn’t want me following in the wayward path of his own life, I suppose.

Id: [0x00087402]
As an Assassin?

Id: [0x00087403]
As a pirate.

Id: [0x00087404]
You would have made a good pirate.

Id: [0x00087407]
Saints preserve us! What is that doing here?

Id: [0x00087409]
That makes no sense.Those rivers barely have enough draft for an oceangoing vessel. She'll be nearly impossible to maneuver.

Id: [0x0008740A]
Maneuverability is hardly the point.

Id: [0x0008740B]
Well I don't intend to find out the point. Let's stay out of her way.

Id: [0x0008740C]
We can find our way around her. Just keep to the smaller rivers where she can't follow.

Id: [0x0008740E]
Why would the French bring such a ship inland?

Id: [0x0008740F]
As the war is drawing to its close, they are becoming desperate. They'll expend any efforts to gain firepower.

Id: [0x00087411]
It's not really my type.

Id: [0x00087414]
{554004}{554004}{554004}The traitor himself! You have more gall than I thought, boy, I'll give you that.

Id: [0x00087416]
{554006}{554006}{554006}Welcome aboard.

Id: [0x00087417]
{554007}{554007}{554007}Let's go get him.

Id: [0x00087418]
{554008}{554008}{554008}She won't be able to follow us in here! And Adewale won't be able to get out, it's a dead end!

Id: [0x00087419]
A novel tactic.

Id: [0x0008741A]
He's saving his crew.

Id: [0x0008741B]
No, he's making a last stand. Let's not disappoint him.

Id: [0x0008741C]
Haytham Kenway.

Id: [0x0008741D]
Indeed, you have been a thorn in our side for far too long!

Id: [0x0008741E]
I served with your father, Haytham. He would be ashamed to see what you have become.

Id: [0x0008741F]
Really? I wasn’t aware my father had a sense of shame.

Id: [0x00087420]
Do not speak ill of your father, boy! If you become half the man he was it will be a blessing.

Id: [0x00087421]
Blessing or curse, I am my own man.

Id: [0x00087422]
Forgive me, Adéwalé.

Id: [0x00087423]
You dare beg forgiveness, child? Hell welcomes traitors like you.

Id: [0x00087424]
Then I go there proudly, knowing I have done right.

Id: [0x00087425]
It does not matter... Achilles already has what he needs.

Id: [0x00087426]
I will kill every last man who defends him, if I must. I cannot let him succeed.

Id: [0x00087427]
You... have become... a monster, Shay.

Id: [0x00087428]
Perhaps I have.

Id: [0x00087430]
No offense to Captain Cook, but that lady has more firepower than any I've had the pleasure of meeting.

Id: [0x00087431]
{554033}{554033}{554033}We cannot wait for reinforcements to arrive, Master Gist, and we must not let Adéwalé escape again.[beat][pensive] That French vessel... I wonder if we can make use of her.[louder] Shay, sneak into the fort. See if you can draw her attention.

Id: [0x00087432]
Ah, but the French ones can have a certain charm. Did I ever tell you the story of Madame Reinette? That wasn't her REAL name, but--[remembering his duty] Right, not the time. Point is, I think I know a safe place where you can debark. Sail on!

Id: [0x00087433]
!*Be careful with those supplies! Those are powerful bombs, and the slightest jolt can set them off.

Id: [0x00087434]
!*My men have handled explosives before.

Id: [0x00087435]
{554037}{554037}{554037}I'm no traitor, Adéwalé. You of all people should understand that. What Achilles is doing--

Id: [0x00087436]
{554038}{554038}{554038}[FR]Non mais, pouvez-vous me dire ce que fait ce taré? [What is this idiot doing?]

Id: [0x00087438]
{554040}{554040}{554040}It is true what they say. Your Templar masters have eyes and ears everywhere in these parts. And plenty of well-trained dogs, I see. Tell me, Shay, do you obey all their commands?

Id: [0x00087439]
{554041}{554041}{554041}Hold your tongue, boy! Do not speak of things you do not understand.

Id: [0x0008743A]

Id: [0x0008743C]
{554044}{554044}{554044}You're trying to give your French masters the advantage, but it will only lead to slaughter.

Id: [0x0008743F]
{554047}{554047}{554047}[FR]Gardes! Attaquez, attaquez-le! [Guards! Attack him!]

Id: [0x00087440]
{554048}{554048}{554048}I neither serve nor respect the French. But I'll be damned if I let the Templars take control of this land.

Id: [0x00087445]
He's getting away.[frustrated] If only he'd stand still and fight me!

Id: [0x00087446]
Adéwalé is facing you on his own terms, picking the battlefield. And on his own ship, he is most at ease.

Id: [0x00087454]
!*[FR]Ce qu’il s’en met plein la geule, ce nègre! [This negro is uppity]

Id: [0x00087455]
!*[FR]Croyez-moi soldat.[believe me soldier] If even one of them goes off, your men will be torn into a thousand pieces.[threatening] And be thankful that keeping you alive is in accordance with my Creed.

!*My men are disciplined, not like the ruffians you're used to.

Id: [0x00087457]
!*[FR]Héla! Faites gaffe avec ça. J’veux pas y rester! [Hey! Be careful with that]

Id: [0x00087458]
This river is getting uncomfortably narrow.

Id: [0x00087459]
Don't you worry, sir! Shay has gotten us out of tighter scrapes before!

Id: [0x0008745A]
It's fortune, it is! The man-o-war can't follow anymore.

Id: [0x0008745B]
And the lake ahead is a dead end. Adéwalé won't be able to get out.

Id: [0x0008745C]
It would seem the gladiator has chosen his arena.

Id: [0x0008745D]
Adéwalé's beached his ship!

Id: [0x00087463]
{554083}{554083}{554083}If the man-o-war thinks we are firing on her, she'll assume we were conquered by the English!

Id: [0x00087464]
{554084}{554084}{554084}That man-o-war could blow us to pieces!

Id: [0x00087468]
{554088}{554088}{554088}Be careful! No friendly fire!

Id: [0x0008746A]

Id: [0x00087519]
!*Good evening, Master Weeks. Do you feel prepared for the congress?

Id: [0x0008751A]
!*Master Monro, I'm glad to see you. I feel at ease, but I think we have to settle some business before we go in there.

Id: [0x0008751C]
!*Ah? What troubles you?

Id: [0x0008751D]
!*The same issue that’s been troubling me for months. It’s Wardrop. I’ve been over his accounts three times, and the numbers just don’t add up.

Id: [0x0008751E]
!*I see… You’re sure these aren’t just arithmetic errors?

Id: [0x0008751F]
!*Sir, mere errors would have money leaking in and out equally. To get all those pounds flowing the same way takes intention.

Id: [0x00087520]
!*It’s hard to believe Wardrop would engage in unsavory practices. He promotes our cause, and has been a loyal Company man for years.

Id: [0x00087521]
!*Come on, boss. You're so soft-hearted you can't believe anybody would take advantage of you, or of us.

Id: [0x00087522]
!*I suppose I like to have faith in people. We are the embodiment of Our Father’s grace and understanding.

Id: [0x00087523]
!*Well sir, your faith is costing us four thousand pounds.

Id: [0x00087524]
!*Four thousand pounds?

Id: [0x00087525]
!*A year. That's how much has been missing from his accounts, on average.

Id: [0x00087526]
!*That is substantial. I will have to speak with him immediately.

Id: [0x00087527]
!*Or you could wait until he’s bled the company dry first. He might buy all of Virginia. There’s this sweet piece of land on Chesapeake Bay I’ve had my eye on, maybe he’ll give me a good deal on it.

Id: [0x00087529]
!*I’ll take care of it, Master Weeks. Pray hold your tongue about this matter until we can settle it quietly. There’s no need to harm Wardrop’s reputation, or ours. The Ohio Company must present a united and blameless front.

Id: [0x0008752A]
!*I don’t give a fig about his reputation. No one would be going easy on him if he weren't already rich as Croesus... But I savvy why you want to keep the Company looking clean. Alright, I’ll keep my mouth shut. But Lord help him if he accuses me of making this up.

Id: [0x0008752B]
!*If he does, I will defend your name and investigation. You’ve done much good work for us, and for me.

Id: [0x0008752C]
!*Thanks Master Monro. I appreciate being in your esteem.

Id: [0x0008752F]
!*Montcalm's men have surrounded the fort. My men are in their ranks. They watch the trails and rivers. The English will not escape.

Id: [0x00087530]
!*Good work. Then it's just a matter of time before they surrender.

Id: [0x00087532]
!*My warriors are not patient, Liam. They belong to tribes pushed aside by the English. Their villages burned. They will not wait long for justice.

Id: [0x00087533]
!*I’ve no love lost for the English either, Kesegowaase. But the French are in charge of this operation, they’ll see it through to the end.

Id: [0x00087534]
!*When the French deliver Monro, I will be satisfied.

Id: [0x00087535]
!*No. The French want him alive. They’re offering him, his men, and their camp followers free and unmolested passage out.

Id: [0x00087542]
!*Agreed. It’s crucial we find out what he knows about the missing manuscript. Hope’s men tell me he’s been asking around in New York. He’s a fool if he thinks we wouldn’t notice.

Id: [0x00087543]
!*He is a fool.(beat) And after he talks?

Id: [0x00087544]
!*He’s a righteous and dangerous man, a threat to the Assassins. We cannot suffer him to live.

Id: [0x00087545]
!*Then our goals are alike. The Assassins, the French, and my people.

Id: [0x00087546]
!*This is not what we agreed to! The Abenaki will never stand for that. They came here to defeat the English, not let them walk away.

Id: [0x00087547]
!*We cannot suffer him to live, Kesegowaase. But the Assassins cannot be seen to betray the French or act against their orders.

Id: [0x00087548]
!*I understand. The Abenaki will be pleased.

Id: [0x00087549]
!*We take care of that ourselves, brother. Tell the Abenaki to distract the French and English alike.

Id: [0x0008754A]
!*Of course. I will pass on the message.

Id: [0x0008754B]
!*They won’t stop at distraction. They have no Creed to weaken them. We will have justice.

Id: [0x0008754E]
!*But who is this angel, and why has she appeared to my unworthy self? Why, Mistress Hope, pardon me. I thought I was witness to a visitation.

Id: [0x0008754F]
!*Caleb, do you think you can buy your way out of trouble with flattery? I’m not nearly so cheap as that.

Id: [0x00087550]
!*I dreamt of nothing of the sort, madam. I was merely basking in your radiance.

Id: [0x00087551]
!*Then understand this divine message: The British are gaining ground, and they’ve done it on your watch.

Id: [0x00087552]
!*Madam, you wound me. I can scarce Adam and Eve[translation: believe] you think I’m falling down on the job. And against my own countrymen, no less!

Id: [0x00087553]
!*Spare me your personal grudges, Caleb. Where are those plans you were supposed to lift from William Johnson’s office?

Id: [0x00087554]
!*Johnson’s doubled his guard. And besides, Salome and her girls haven’t been keeping up their end of the bargain. They were supposed to distract Loose-trousers Johnson from his business so my fellow could go in and get the goods.

Id: [0x00087555]
!*Well might I suggest you go in yourself next time. I’m sure Johnson is already distracted enough with both his wives.

Id: [0x00087556]
!*Two wives, that’s double the trouble and strife I crave. And of course I’ll take care of it myself next time, my lady.

Id: [0x00087557]
!*Good. And you can help yourself to anything else in his office. I hear he’s got very fine taste in Bordeaux.

Id: [0x00087558]
!*That he does… I mean, I wouldn’t know a thing about that, or the cases of champers either. Cheers, mistress!(leaves)

Id: [0x00087559]
!*If that man had more than half a brain, I'd be worried.

Id: [0x0008755C]
!*Why, what’s this? Casey, your blasted dog’s chewed up my slippers again!

Id: [0x0008755D]
!*My dog? That mutt’s your charge, Barry.

Id: [0x0008755E]
!*No he isn’t. You brought Ginger in two summers ago, during that drought.

Id: [0x00087560]
!*I remember the drought well. Grasshoppers everywhere, getting in the pantry and water barrels. Every pie had half a dozen in the crust. But I also remember you picking them off that pup’s fur! Ginger’s your trouble, you teach him not to chew your belongings.

Id: [0x00087561]
!*If you weren’t such a tender-hearted woman, Casey, we wouldn’t have this problem with strays. Why, I remember when we came over on the boat from the Gael, you insisted on sharing your biscuits with that poor lass berthed next to us. We might have starved, but you in Christian charity insisted that we not starve together.

Id: [0x00087562]
!*I gave her the maggoty biscuits to convince her we’d nothing of value in our kit bags, you old fool! She was a pickpocket, and a lousy one at that! Didn’t you wonder why she had a full purse and belly at the end of that voyage?

Id: [0x00087563]
!*She was just, resourceful, I suppose.

Id: [0x00087564]

Id: [0x000875CD]
{554445}{554445}{554445}Something like that. I want to know more about that box you said you heard about.

Id: [0x000875CE]
{554446}{554446}{554446}Sure! I was collecting some marks in the British camp when I heard General Howe talking about this weird contraption. Get him to talk and you're made.

Id: [0x000875CF]
{554447}{554447}{554447}BRITISH general? That's going to be complicated.

Id: [0x000875D0]
{554448}{554448}{554448}Piece of cake. Thanks Hendrick, keep up the good work.

Id: [0x000875D2]
{554450}{554450}{554450}Hope, have you lost your mother-loving mind? If a British general has the box, it might as well have "PROPERTY OF THE TEMPLARS" stamped right on it.

Id: [0x000875D3]
{554451}{554451}{554451}How little you understand... General Howe is on our side. Things aren't as black and white as you think.

Id: [0x000875D4]
{554452}{554452}{554452}Achilles never told me there were Assassins in the British army.

Id: [0x000875D5]
{554453}{554453}{554453}That was need to know information, and you didn't need to know... Until now. Now let's go find the guy.

Id: [0x000875D7]
{554455}{554455}{554455}And you say the Templars are brutal. Alright, why are you here?

Id: [0x000875D8]
{554456}{554456}{554456}Don't you guys ever knock? I can't be seen with Assassins, I'd lose my commission.

Id: [0x000875D9]
{554457}{554457}{554457}Don't worry, we only killed a dozen guys and a dog on the way in here.

Id: [0x000875DB]
{554459}{554459}{554459}We're looking for a box. It looks ancient and is covered with strange writing...

Id: [0x000875DC]
{554460}{554460}{554460}You guys are good. Yes, I heard of a box like that. There's this fellow called Benjamin Franklin, odd but very smart. Likeable enough. Well, two soldiers here got orders from the top to liaison with him about some new research.

Id: [0x000875DD]
{554461}{554461}{554461}You're the general, aren't you the top?

Id: [0x000875DE]
{554462}{554462}{554462}Where do you get these kids?

Id: [0x000875DF]
{554463}{554463}{554463}He means Grand Master Reginald Birch. That jackal is "advising" the British Army from a castle in France. The irony is sweet.

Id: [0x000875E0]
{554464}{554464}{554464}I find it repulsive. So that's why I'm telling you, find those men and take their orders. I don't want to know how, I just want the Templars out of my army.

Id: [0x000875E1]
{554465}{554465}{554465}What do you know, a British officer I can respect! This day is certainly full of wonders.

Id: [0x000875E2]
{554466}{554466}{554466}You'll want to be getting out of here now.

Id: [0x000875E9]
{554473}{554473}{554473}Thank you! We must leave before the guards catch us.

Id: [0x000875EF]
{554479}{554479}{554479}Let's go find those two men.

Id: [0x000875F0]
{554480}{554480}{554480}Sounds good.

Id: [0x000875F2]
{554482}{554482}{554482}So, if I may enter the territory of "need to know", who's Grand Master Birch? I mean, I know he's in charge of the Templars, but what's this man like?

Id: [0x000875F6]
{554486}{554486}{554486}A strange, creepy fellow from all accounts. Reginald Birch spent years travelling through Europe, checking up on business with a caravan of rotating Templar staff. Apparently he didn't trust anyone enough to keep them on for more than a year or so. Oh, and took a dead Assassin's ten-year-old son as his ward and apprentice. Like I said, creepy.

Id: [0x000875F7]
{554487}{554487}{554487}The Grand Master's apprentice is a ten-year-old boy?

Id: [0x000875F8]
{554488}{554488}{554488}Oh no, this all happened about twenty years ago. The child grew up to be his second-in-command, as far as we can tell.

Id: [0x000875FA]
{554490}{554490}{554490}You said that Birch's second-in-command was a dead Assassin's son. Did the Assassins just let the man keep the lad?

Id: [0x000875FB]
{554491}{554491}{554491}Of course not! But from what I was told, so many Brothers were killed in the attempt to retrieve him that they had to give up. Apparently he killed some of his rescuers himself. That lad's a beast. I suppose he'll likely lead the Templars himself some day.

Id: [0x000875FC]
{554492}{554492}{554492}I wonder how that works. Do you think they have an election or something?

Id: [0x000875FD]
{554493}{554493}{554493}More like a knife in the back, I venture.

Id: [0x00087608]
{554504}{554504}{554504}That is also possible.

Id: [0x00087609]
{554505}{554505}{554505}Riiiiight. So, what are we doing?

Id: [0x0008760A]
{554506}{554506}{554506}Some sailors I know have mentioned seeing some strange maps and charts around lately. They're bound in a book and full of strange symbols... sound like something we know?

Id: [0x0008760B]
{554507}{554507}{554507}That manuscript. Interesting. Do you think it is a map or chart?

Id: [0x0008760C]
{554508}{554508}{554508}I am not sure. But I am sure we can find out.

Id: [0x00087610]
{554512}{554512}{554512}So what do we do now?

Id: [0x00087611]
{554513}{554513}{554513}We fight our way through, of course.

Id: [0x00087613]
{554515}{554515}{554515}Great! Now what do we do?

Id: [0x00087614]
{554516}{554516}{554516}Straight on until we reach Ile d'Anticosti.

Id: [0x00087615]
{554517}{554517}{554517}Anticosti Island? What's that?

Id: [0x00087616]
{554518}{554518}{554518}A ship's graveyard. Handy place to do business you don't want interrupted. We'll meet my friends there.

Id: [0x00087617]
{554519}{554519}{554519}Your friends are creepy, captain.

Id: [0x00087618]
{554520}{554520}{554520}You have no idea.

Id: [0x0008761C]
!*Hector? My stars and garters, it can't be...

Id: [0x0008761D]
!*You're right, it can't. That's Shay, we gave him Hector's coat.

Id: [0x0008761E]
!*Of course, my good sir.

Id: [0x0008761F]
!*My apologies to you as well, Shay, was it?

Id: [0x00087620]
!*No harm done. And you are Master...?

Id: [0x00087621]
!*Gist! Christopher Gist, explorer, navigator, and(pause) investor. Come, join me! Cassie, darling, won't you bring us some ale? Put it on my tab.

Id: [0x00087623]
!*Thank you, Cassie.(drinks some ale) Master Gist, what exactly do you invest in?

Id: [0x00087624]
!*Many things. But at the moment, I mostly invest in this city. New York has great potential, but she will never realize it unless men of good intention raise her right.

Id: [0x00087625]
!*My friend, you sell yourself short! Those horrid gangs have been sowing chaos in this city for years, and I am heartened by your progress against them. I really am.

Id: [0x00087626]
!*We mentioned you to Master Gist, Shay. Told him the good you've been doing ridding the neighborhood of miscreants.

Id: [0x00087627]
!*It's less than nothing...

Id: [0x00087628]
!*I'm glad to help.

Id: [0x00087629]
!*So am I! Shay, let's get down to brass tacks. Putting a city to rights is not cheap work. But, if you lend an ear to my advice, you might earn the resources you need.

Id: [0x0008762A]
!*Are you offering me a job, Master Gist?

Id: [0x0008762B]
!*A career, Shay. The river valley is full of riches just waiting to be plucked. Of course, we might have to find you a ship, first...

Id: [0x0008762C]
!*Actually, sir, I have a vessel. It's moored not far from here.

Id: [0x0008762D]
!*Then drop the "sir" and call me "mate"! Let's go pay her a visit!

Id: [0x00087633]
{554547}{554547}{554547}Shay.(pause) Memeskia has been here, asking questions.

Id: [0x00087634]
{554548}{554548}{554548}Who is this fellow?

Id: [0x00087637]
{554551}{554551}{554551}Memeskia is a Piankashaw chieftain and ally of the British. They even call him "Old Briton". The Templars help his tribe. He has been asking many wise people about a power source for the artifact.

Id: [0x00087639]
{554553}{554553}{554553}That's good intelligence. What's the plan?

Id: [0x0008763A]
{554554}{554554}{554554}Find him. Ask him what he knows. Kill him.

Id: [0x0008763D]
{554557}{554557}{554557}The usual business, then. Got any leads on where Memeskia is?

Id: [0x0008763E]
{554558}{554558}{554558}I don't.(points out a man standing some distance away) But that trader, with the map, does.

Id: [0x0008763F]
{554559}{554559}{554559}Got it. I'll lighten his tongue or his burden, whichever helps.

Id: [0x00087643]
{554563}{554563}{554563}Interesting. Memeskia is a few miles downriver from here. I'll catch up to him with the Morrigan.

Id: [0x00087649]
{554569}{554569}{554569}Ah, that vessel full of warriors must be going to meet Memeskia.

Id: [0x0008764B]
{554571}{554571}{554571}Damn these logs! Who left all this lumber in the middle of the river?

Id: [0x0008764E]
{554574}{554574}{554574}Shay, Memeskia is up there on that cliff.

Id: [0x0008764F]
{554575}{554575}{554575}That's quite a climb.

Id: [0x00087650]
{554576}{554576}{554576}Use the masts. It's faster.

Id: [0x00087654]
{554580}{554580}{554580}What were you looking for, Memeskia?

Id: [0x00087655]
{554581}{554581}{554581}The Company has many resources, and unites many tribes. They will find the old power.

Id: [0x00087656]
{554582}{554582}{554582}The Ohio Company?

Id: [0x00087657]
{554583}{554583}{554583}Power. From the first sunrise when the gods spoke to my people. I needed to bring life back to their gift.

Id: [0x0008765A]
{554586}{554586}{554586}I can't say I grasp your thinking, old man.

Id: [0x0008765B]
{554587}{554587}{554587}May the Lord judge you kindly, old heathen.

Id: [0x00087661]
{554593}{554593}{554593}So, what have you learned?

Id: [0x00087663]
{554595}{554595}{554595}The Ohio Company is behind this all the way.

Id: [0x00087664]
{554596}{554596}{554596}Figures. They're a Templar front. Alright, Lawrence Washington is a mover and shaker with them, go find him and bring the artifact back.

Id: [0x0008766A]
{554602}{554602}{554602}Do you need something, brother? Some tea, some treacle for your throat?

Id: [0x0008766B]
{554603}{554603}{554603}No, thank you George.(coughs) You're doing a fine job of playing nursemaid.

Id: [0x0008766C]
{554604}{554604}{554604}I'd rather play hunting guide. I saw a flock of pheasants this morning. We could have brought in ten brace together.

Id: [0x0008766D]
Lawrence Washington is a powerful businessman, a slave owner, and a leading Templar. We lost track of him about a year ago.[beat] I recently learned he was in Barbados, but I haven't been able to confirm that. Now...

Id: [0x00087670]
{554608}{554608}{554608}Ah, then Amy in the kitchen would curse us for all the work we'd make her do dressing them.

Id: [0x00087672]
{554610}{554610}{554610}George, I think I would like some of that treacle actually. Could you go in and get me some, with ginger in it?

Id: [0x00087673]
{554611}{554611}{554611}Of course. I'll be right back.

Id: [0x00087674]
{554612}{554612}{554612}Take your time.

Id: [0x00087676]
{554614}{554614}{554614}Come out, Assassin.

Id: [0x00087678]
{554616}{554616}{554616}After an easy target?

Id: [0x00087679]
{554617}{554617}{554617}Not at all. I aim for the head.

Id: [0x0008767A]
{554618}{554618}{554618}Then you're in the wrong place.(pause) The Templars cut me adrift when it was clear I could be of no more use to them.

Id: [0x0008767B]
{554619}{554619}{554619}Why should I believe you?

Id: [0x0008767C]
{554620}{554620}{554620}You don't have to, it doesn't matter.

Id: [0x0008767D]
{554621}{554621}{554621}But this does. My brother, George, has nothing to do with this war. Stay away from him. He has no blood on his hands, and I want it to stay that way. He is not a man of the cross.

Id: [0x0008767E]
{554622}{554622}{554622}I hear you.

Id: [0x0008767F]
{554623}{554623}{554623}Then I have done all I can.(pause) "That thou doest, do quickly."

Id: [0x00087680]
{554624}{554624}{554624}I am no Judas. I do what has to be done.

Id: [0x00087683]
{554627}{554627}{554627}Why should I believe you?

Id: [0x00087685]
This won't do. Shay, you must follow that ship on land.

Id: [0x0008768B]
{554635}{554635}{554635}So, what's happening?

Id: [0x0008768C]
{554636}{554636}{554636}Liam, this is the most BORING MAN IN THE WORLD! George Washington is a great big nothing! He knows nothing and does nothing!

Id: [0x0008768D]
{554637}{554637}{554637}Shay, there has to be something special about him.

Id: [0x0008768E]
{554638}{554638}{554638}Well, he is sending some pretty hot notes to a married chick. But even that seems pretty hopeless.

Id: [0x0008768F]
{554639}{554639}{554639}Well, stick with him. His brother was a bigshot, someone in the Templars has to contact him eventually.

Id: [0x00087692]
{554642}{554642}{554642}"To whom it may concern..." "Hello nephew, how's the army?" "My dearest fondling father..." OK, the Assassins don't pay me enough to read this crap.

Id: [0x00087694]
{554644}{554644}{554644}"Dear George, there is some business pertaining to your late brother we should discuss. Meet us at the usual place at noon on Monday." Now that sounds interesting.

Id: [0x00087697]
{554647}{554647}{554647}Oh no, I'll be late!

Id: [0x00087698]
{554648}{554648}{554648}I'd better hurry up and follow him.

Id: [0x0008769A]
{554650}{554650}{554650}Hi, I'm here!

Id: [0x0008769B]
{554651}{554651}{554651}Me too!

Id: [0x0008769C]
{554652}{554652}{554652}So, what do you guys want with me?

Id: [0x0008769D]
{554653}{554653}{554653}Do you have a moment to discuss the Father of Understanding?

Id: [0x0008769E]
{554654}{554654}{554654}For the seventy-eighth time, I'm not joining the Templars!

Id: [0x0008769F]
{554655}{554655}{554655}Alright, fine. But you will help us out with some of your brother's stuff?

Id: [0x000876A0]
{554656}{554656}{554656}Because it's for him, cool.

Id: [0x000876A1]
{554657}{554657}{554657}Alright, here's some info about the artifact we found.

Id: [0x000876A2]
{554658}{554658}{554658}I'm getting the box next week!

Id: [0x000876A3]
{554659}{554659}{554659}Good for you, Smith. Maybe there will be a Precursor cookie inside.

Id: [0x000876A4]
{554660}{554660}{554660}Yay magic cookies!

Id: [0x000876A5]
{554661}{554661}{554661}Next target: Samuel Smith.

Id: [0x000876AA]
{554666}{554666}{554666}But Samuel Smith is in a British military convoy, how are we going to get to his ship?

Id: [0x000876AC]
{554668}{554668}{554668}Onwards! We have to get that box!

Id: [0x000876AD]
{554669}{554669}{554669}Any problem can be solved by the judicious application of piracy.

Id: [0x000876B1]
{554673}{554673}{554673}Any last words?

Id: [0x000876B2]
{554674}{554674}{554674}Templars forever!

Id: [0x000877E6]
Pleasure's mine, sir.

Id: [0x000877E7]
{554983}{554983}{554983}Not as well as I’d like. I could continue my explorations, if not for this war.

Id: [0x000877E9]
They're hit!

Id: [0x000877EA]
Damn it! We cannot let any through!

Id: [0x000877EC]
More fireships!

Id: [0x000877ED]
Fireships, Cap'n!

Id: [0x000877EE]
Fireships sighted!

Id: [0x000877EF]
Another wave of fireships, Captain!

Id: [0x000877F0]
Fireships!

Id: [0x000877F2]
More enemy ships, sir!

Id: [0x000877F3]
I see two men-o-war!

Id: [0x000877F4]
And more fireships!

Id: [0x000877F5]
This is hopeless. Perhaps it would be wiser to fall back.

Id: [0x000877F6]
War and wisdom don't always mix, Captain.

Id: [0x000877F7]
This isn't over yet, lads! Man the cannons!

Id: [0x000877F8]
[Cheers]

Id: [0x00087803]
{555011}{555011}{555011}Brace! Brace!

Id: [0x00087807]
{555015}{555015}{555015}Brace!

Id: [0x00087830]
{555056}{555056}{555056}Try the Puckle gun on them, Captain!

Id: [0x00087831]
{555057}{555057}{555057}We could use the Puckle gun to target her weak spots!

Id: [0x00087832]
{555058}{555058}{555058}The Puckle gun will be much faster, sir!

Id: [0x00087833]
{555059}{555059}{555059}We’ll be more precise using the Puckle gun, captain!

Id: [0x00087834]
{555060}{555060}{555060}Not to presume, sir, but the Puckle gun would be ideal right now!

Id: [0x00087849]
{555081}{555081}{555081}We cannot wait for reinforcements to arrive, Master Gist, and we must not let Adéwalé escape again.

Id: [0x0008784A]
{555082}{555082}{555082}I think I know a safe place where you can debark. Sail on!

Id: [0x0008784C]
!*Help!

Id: [0x0008784D]
!*We're under attack!

Id: [0x0008784E]
{555086}{555086}{555086}Oh my god!

Id: [0x0008784F]
!*What the devil just happened?

Id: [0x00087850]
!*I can't stay out in the open like this.

Id: [0x00087851]
{555089}{555089}{555089}It's not safe here I need to move

Id: [0x00087852]
!*What the...

Id: [0x00087853]
!*Wait! Don't shoo-

Id: [0x00087854]
{555092}{555092}{555092}What? You've tricked me

Id: [0x00087855]
!*Come out, come out wherever you are...

Id: [0x00087856]
!*Let's smoke you out!

Id: [0x00087857]
{555095}{555095}{555095}Are you here?

Id: [0x00087858]
!*What is this?

Id: [0x00087859]
!*Wow! Look at that!

Id: [0x0008785A]
{555098}{555098}{555098}What the ...?

Id: [0x0008785B]
!*There's a body here!

Id: [0x0008785C]
!*Look at that, stone dead.

Id: [0x0008785D]
{555101}{555101}{555101}Shit! A body!

Id: [0x0008785E]
!*Now, what's this here?

Id: [0x0008785F]
!*(coughing)What is this?

Id: [0x00087860]
{555104}{555104}{555104}This doesn't look good

Id: [0x00087861]
!*I don't like this one bit. There's a killer about, shoot anyone suspicious.

Id: [0x00087862]
!*This is not good! Stay sharp.

Id: [0x00087863]
{555107}{555107}{555107}Be prepared this is not good.

Id: [0x00087864]
!*I will crush you.

Id: [0x00087865]
!*Let's see how good you are with your blades.

Id: [0x00087866]
{555110}{555110}{555110}Let's fight!

Id: [0x00087867]
!*Where did he go?

Id: [0x00087868]
!*I will find him!

Id: [0x00087869]
{555113}{555113}{555113}Ok, where are you?

Id: [0x0008786A]
!*What is this?

Id: [0x0008786B]
!*What a strange fog...

Id: [0x0008786C]
{555116}{555116}{555116}This doesn't look good

Id: [0x0008786D]
!*Quick, help your master!

Id: [0x0008786E]
!*Brothers, join me against the enemy!

Id: [0x0008786F]
{555119}{555119}{555119}Come on! I need you now!

Id: [0x00087870]
!*Quick! Shoot him!

Id: [0x00087871]
!*I have him. Shoot!

Id: [0x00087872]
{555122}{555122}{555122}Shoot now!

Id: [0x00087873]
!*Do you like that? It's my own recipe.

Id: [0x00087874]
!*Taste this!

Id: [0x00087875]
{555125}{555125}{555125}The poison will take your life

Id: [0x00087876]
!*Try to shoot me now, fool!

Id: [0x00087877]
!*Stand still!

Id: [0x00087878]
{555128}{555128}{555128}Go on shoot!

Id: [0x00087879]
!*We have another body here!

Id: [0x0008787A]

Id: [0x0008799D]
You irresponsible wretch!

Id: [0x0008799F]
{555423}{555423}{555423}It is being responsible for an ancient and proud tradition. It is obeying your Mentor without question. How else will we ensure freedom for the human race?

Id: [0x000879D7]
!*Find him. Ask him what he knows. Kill him.

Id: [0x000879D8]
!*The usual business, then. Got any leads on where Memeskia is?

Id: [0x000879D9]
!*I don't.(points out a man standing some distance away) But that trader, with the map, does.

Id: [0x000879DA]
!*Got it. I'll lighten his tongue or his burden, whichever helps.

Id: [0x000879DC]
!*Interesting. Memeskia is a few miles downriver from here. I'll catch up to him with the Morrigan.

Id: [0x000879E0]
!*Ah, that vessel full of warriors must be going to meet Memeskia.

Id: [0x000879E3]
!*Damn these logs! Who left all this lumber in the middle of the river?

Id: [0x000879E6]
!*Shay, Memeskia is up there on that cliff.

Id: [0x000879E7]
!*That's quite a climb.

Id: [0x000879E8]
!*Use the masts. It's faster.

Id: [0x000879ED]
!*What were you looking for, Memeskia?

Id: [0x000879EE]
!*Power. From the first sunrise when the gods spoke to my people. I needed to bring life back to their gift.

Id: [0x000879EF]
!*I can't say I grasp your thinking, old man.

Id: [0x000879F0]
!*The Company has many resources, and unites many tribes. They will find the old power.

Id: [0x000879F1]
!*The Ohio Company?

Id: [0x000879F3]
!*May the Lord judge you kindly, old heathen.

Id: [0x000879F6]
Gentlemen, stop![Beat] We've got a common enemy, and I reckon he's close.

Id: [0x000879F9]
{555513}{555513}{555513}Don't be so hard on the lad, Chevalier.

Id: [0x000879FA]
{555514}{555514}{555514}He is not a lad, he is a man. And an Assassin. What does the mentor sees in him?

Id: [0x000879FB]
{555515}{555515}{555515}Shay has much potential.

Id: [0x000879FC]
{555516}{555516}{555516}But no discipline!

Id: [0x000879FE]
{555518}{555518}{555518}Did you see that floating piece of dung docked off the coast?

Id: [0x000879FF]
{555519}{555519}{555519}The craft marred with a black bird on it? I thought it was wrecked, not docked.

Id: [0x00087A01]
{555521}{555521}{555521}One would think! It is a right shame what passes off for a ship in these parts.

Id: [0x00087A02]
{555522}{555522}{555522}A shame it is. But perhaps she'll do some good... as firewood.

Id: [0x00087A03]
{555523}{555523}{555523}I like your way of thinking!

Id: [0x00087A05]
I was saving those fellows for you.

Id: [0x00087A06]
Very thoughtful.

Id: [0x00087A08]
{555528}{555528}{555528}We owe you our thanks, lad! They would have hung us for sure.

Id: [0x00087A09]
{555529}{555529}{555529}We don't have much coin, but would you be wanting a ship?

Id: [0x00087A0A]
{555530}{555530}{555530}I shall supervise the bailing and fire brigade.

Id: [0x00087A0B]
[FR][Morgane](Morrigan)... The silly fairy queen who ruined Merlin the Wise. Oh oh... She is perfect for you, Shay.

Id: [0x00087A0C]
The Morrigan was an old goddess, it's the Queen of War and Darkness. She harvested the souls of fallen warriors. Perfect indeed.

Id: [0x00087A0D]
{555533}{555533}{555533}We'll see if we can't put her right.

Id: [0x00087A0E]
{555534}{555534}{555534}Don't mind him, "Captain Cormac".

Id: [0x00087A0F]
{555535}{555535}{555535}Quite right, "First Mate O’Brien".

Id: [0x00087A13]
She's mine, ain't she? My own ship.

Id: [0x00087A14]
Your own pile of garbage, yes.

Id: [0x00087A15]
Ah, with a lick of paint and a few new cannons, she'll look as fine as anything on the seven seas.

Id: [0x00087A16]
Shall we begin, Captain?

Id: [0x00087A17]
Indeed, Mate!

Id: [0x00087A18]
[FR][Connards...](Idiots...)

Id: [0x00087A1A]
Slow down to make a tighter turn, Shay.

Id: [0x00087A1B]
The way is narrow. Take in the sail when you turn.

Id: [0x00087A1C]
Train our guns on those icebergs, Shay. Some iron will clear the way right quick!<CR>

Id: [0x00087A1D]
Would you look at that, a narwhal! A right sea unicorn that is.

Id: [0x00087A1E]
Whale! A man could be well set hunting those.

Id: [0x00087A1F]
Whaling's a tough life, but it makes for some wealthy men... and happy wives, I hear.

Id: [0x00087A21]
It seems this vessel is battle-ready after all. I will return to what is left of [FR]Le Gerfaut. It is a long way home, and we have repairs to do.

Id: [0x00087A22]
Sing hearty, lads. Chevalier is pleased with us!

Id: [0x00087A27]
Well, we won't lack for firewood at least.

Id: [0x00087A29]
{555561}{555561}{555561}UUNGH!

Id: [0x00087A31]
Shay and I will free those smugglers, you treat your wounded.<CR>

Id: [0x00087A3C]
Ah, the cabbage farmer returns. About time.[beat] We have a lead on the curious manuscript.

Id: [0x00087A3D]
I'd be surprised if you could read it.

Id: [0x00087A3E]
No one can read it, [FR][imbecile](you silly man). This is why the Templars are taking so long with it. But one of our allies has caught a glimpse of their work.

Id: [0x00087A3F]
A pirate?

Id: [0x00087A40]
A spy who works with the [FR] pirates.[business like] We set sail for Anticosti. That should prove a good test for this floating cesspit you call a ship.

Id: [0x00087A43]
{555587}{555587}{555587}How looks the sea before us, First Mate?

Id: [0x00087A44]
{555588}{555588}{555588}Crowded, Captain. There's a British blockade in our path.

Id: [0x00087A45]
That's fine indeed. Perhaps we should aid her journey to the bottom of the sea.

Id: [0x00087A46]
{555590}{555590}{555590}The English despise piracy in what they wrongly assume are their waters.

Id: [0x00087A47]
{555591}{555591}{555591}Let us disabuse them of that notion, then.

Id: [0x00087A49]
There, Captain! An English vessel, and she looks to be in trouble.

Id: [0x00087A4B]
Captain, why are we changing course?

Id: [0x00087A4C]
Shay, you're going the wrong way.

Id: [0x00087A4D]
Are we heading to Nassau, Shay? Because Anticosti's the other direction!

Id: [0x00087A4E]
I wonder what Peking is like... We'll reach it if you don't get back on course!

Id: [0x00087A50]
Would you look over there!

Id: [0x00087A51]
Isn't that a strange beauty.

Id: [0x00087A59]
Let's not be too hasty. She's full of Crown cargo.

Id: [0x00087A5B]
A pretty sight. I say this is a good day to lighten King George's pockets.

Id: [0x00087A5C]
Be careful. A few shots should be enough to cripple her. Too much damage and she'll go down with all souls. And all spoils.

Id: [0x00087A5D]
For once, I find myself agreeing with you, Shay.

Id: [0x00087A5E]
Stranger things have happened.

Id: [0x00087B2B]
{555819}{555819}{555819}Captain, that schooner is full of Crown cargo!

Id: [0x00087B2C]
{555820}{555820}{555820}Is it? Well I say this is a good day to lighten King George's pockets.

Id: [0x00087B2D]
{555821}{555821}{555821}Be careful. Fire just enough to cripple her, then we can board. Too much damage and she will go to the bottom with all souls.

Id: [0x00087B2E]
{555822}{555822}{555822}Perhaps it is, Shay.

Id: [0x00087B2F]
{555823}{555823}{555823}We can board and loot her before her crew knows what hit them.

Id: [0x00087B31]
{555825}{555825}{555825}Now's the time, let's board her!

Id: [0x00087B33]
{555827}{555827}{555827}Captain, hold your fire! We do not want to sink her!

Id: [0x00087B35]
{555829}{555829}{555829}Damn! There goes our spoils. I hope you can find another goose to pluck.

Id: [0x00087B37]
{555831}{555831}{555831}Teach them a lesson, Captain!

Id: [0x00087B38]
{555832}{555832}{555832}Come on men, show 'em what we're made of!

Id: [0x00087B39]
{555833}{555833}{555833}What sorry rogues these are!

Id: [0x00087B3A]
{555834}{555834}{555834}For the Morrigan!

Id: [0x00087B41]
The sea between here and Anticosti is rough, Captain. We should strengthen the Morrigan before going any farther.

Id: [0x00087B43]
There's a harbourmaster stationed nearby. We can spend our new wealth on improvements.

Id: [0x00087B48]
{555848}{555848}{555848}If you want beef, raid more British brigs. They have barrels by the ton! But I doubt you are here for the food.

Id: [0x00087B4A]
Captain, the ship is damaged!

Id: [0x00087B4C]
Anticosti shouldn't be far. Keep us on course, Captain.

Id: [0x00087B4F]
Salt air, open skies... A man out on the ocean is as free as a man can be. What do you say, Liam?

Id: [0x00087B50]
We're out here for a reason, Shay. Mind your duty.

Id: [0x00087B51]
Well what is the point of freedom if you cannot breathe deep and enjoy it?

Id: [0x00087B52]
The Templars stick to this continent like tar. I won't feel liberated until we pry them off.

Id: [0x00087B53]
Seems to me we should just talk to them like men instead of skulking around.

Id: [0x00087B54]
And would you smile and wish them a good day as they lay their boot on your neck?

Id: [0x00087B55]
Of course not.

Id: [0x00087B56]
{555862}{555862}{555862}They are murdering bastards who want to control the world and everyone in it, mind it.

Id: [0x00087B57]
And we have nothing in common with that, of course.

Id: [0x00087B59]
{555865}{555865}{555865}This weather is terrible!

Id: [0x00087B5A]
{555866}{555866}{555866}The cold tries men's souls.

Id: [0x00087B5B]
{555867}{555867}{555867}I thought we had to get swallowed alive by a whale for that.

Id: [0x00087B5C]
{555868}{555868}{555868}Life has many trials, Shay. Surviving these conditions is but one of them.

Id: [0x00087B5D]
{555869}{555869}{555869}I'd say you sound like my old schoolmaster, Liam, but I never paid him much mind.

Id: [0x00087B5E]
{555870}{555870}{555870}Ha ha!

Id: [0x00087B5F]
{555871}{555871}{555871}Ha ha!

Id: [0x00087B61]
{555873}{555873}{555873}Do you know the most important thing about icebergs, Shay?

Id: [0x00087B62]
{555874}{555874}{555874}That they are made of ice?

Id: [0x00087B63]
{555875}{555875}{555875}That most of their ice is below the water. You are seeing but a fraction of their true bulk.

Id: [0x00087B64]
{555876}{555876}{555876}If a narwhal swam straight into an iceberg, would its horn get stuck?

Id: [0x00087B65]
{555877}{555877}{555877}You are a greater fool than I feared.

Id: [0x00087B67]
You know, Captain, we could harpoon some whales for supplies. There is plenty of oil and bone in each of those beasts.

Id: [0x00087B69]
We're not too far from Anticosti Island now.

Id: [0x00087B6A]
Will your friend the spy be waiting for us?

Id: [0x00087B6B]
Yes. I hope Le Chasseur has more information about the Manuscript.

Id: [0x00087B6C]
Maybe he'll have the whole thing figured out for us.

Id: [0x00087B6D]
And maybe I'm Emperor of Rome.

Id: [0x00087B6E]
Ave Caesar!

Id: [0x00087B76]
{555894}{555894}{555894}Le Chasseur, [FR]mon ami!(my friend!)

Id: [0x00087B77]
Dock the ship here, Captain. We've arrived at Anticosti Island.

Id: [0x00087B78]
Go on ahead, Shay. We will meet you at the fort.

Id: [0x00087B7B]
I miss my Marie. Such a true and fine heart is hard to find.

Id: [0x00087B7C]
Where did you meet her?

Id: [0x00087B7D]
At her third wedding. I slipped into the feast.

Id: [0x00087B7E]
I would say you slipped into more than that!

Id: [0x00087B80]
The rum here is terrible!

Id: [0x00087B81]
Let me see... That's not rum, it's [FR]eau de vie!

Id: [0x00087B82]
Whiskey.

Id: [0x00087B83]
Well the whiskey here is terrible!

Id: [0x00087B85]
I wonder why there are so many Royal Navy ships about.

Id: [0x00087B86]
I suppose because there are more French ships to challenge them.

Id: [0x00087B87]
Who has more ships, do you reckon?

Id: [0x00087B88]
The English, by far. But they're spread thin.

Id: [0x00087B89]
Do they have more than the Spanish?

Id: [0x00087B8A]
Hard to tell. But the Spanish keep to the south. Too cold for them here.

Id: [0x00087B8B]
I can't say I blame them.

Id: [0x00087B8D]
Oh by Beelzebub's balls, what happened to that wall? It looks like someone took a cannon to it.

Id: [0x00087B8E]
I hate digging stone out of the frozen ground. Fixing it will take ages.

Id: [0x00087B8F]
{555919}{555919}{555919}Louis-Joseph!

Id: [0x00087B90]
Le Chasseur, allow me to present our associate, Shay Cormac.

Id: [0x00087B91]
{555921}{555921}{555921}We hear you have seen a strange manuscript.

Id: [0x00087B92]
Gentlemen, I have news... On this same ship I spied the Manuscript you seek.

Id: [0x00087B93]
Were there no charts? No, no... no maps?

Id: [0x00087B94]
No. There may have been some kind of code, but neither I nor the Rosbifs could ken it.

Id: [0x00087B95]
Where is the Manuscript now?

Id: [0x00087B97]
The man who brought it said a man named Washington sent him.

Id: [0x00087B98]
I know that name, he's an important Templar isn't he?

Id: [0x00087B99]
He is, Lawrence Washington has great ambitions that Templars have helped fulfill. Shay, let's return and find him.[to LE CHASSEUR] You sir, have our thanks.

Id: [0x00087B9A]
{555930}{555930}{555930}What manner of things does he invent?

Id: [0x00087B9B]
{555931}{555931}{555931}Oh, scientific instruments, tools for printers, geegaws like that. He is working with electrical fire now.

Id: [0x00087B9C]
{555932}{555932}{555932}You mean like lightning?

Id: [0x00087B9D]
{555933}{555933}{555933}Aye. Word is he's trying to trap lightning in a jar, to use it again later.

Id: [0x00087B9E]
{555934}{555934}{555934}Use it for what?

Id: [0x00087B9F]
Take a look at this.[showing the blueprint] I "borrowed" these plans from a Royal Navy ship of the line. They are like nothing I have ever seen.

Id: [0x00087BA0]
{555936}{555936}{555936}Templar business?

Id: [0x00087BA1]
{555937}{555937}{555937}More than likely.

Id: [0x00087BA2]
Good! We could use more powerful weapons.

Id: [0x00087BA7]
!*So, what are we doing here anyway?

Id: [0x00087BA8]
!*Shay, you're such a moron. Achilles sent us here to find the power source.

Id: [0x00087BA9]
!*So how are we going to do that, sweetheart?

Id: [0x00087BAA]
!*Don't sweetheart me! My lieutenant Hendrick says he has a lead so we're going to see him. He counts my money and keeps people in line.

Id: [0x00087BAB]
!*Your crime lord act is scaring me, Hope. But that's kind of hot. I'm so conflicted...

Id: [0x00087BAC]
!*What makes you think it's an act? Now, let's go find him.

Id: [0x00087BB2]
!*Ah! Hope, my favorite boss! How are you today? And who's this guy, a new leg-breaker?

Id: [0x00087BB3]
!*Something like that. I want to know more about that box you said you heard about.

Id: [0x00087BB4]
!*Sure! I was collecting some marks in the British camp when I heard General Howe talking about this weird contraption. Get him to talk and you're made.

Id: [0x00087BB6]
!*BRITISH general? That's going to be complicated.

Id: [0x00087BB7]
!*Piece of cake. Thanks Hendrick, keep up the good work.

Id: [0x00087BB9]
!*Hope, have you lost your mother-loving mind? If a British general has the box, it might as well have "PROPERTY OF THE TEMPLARS" stamped right on it.

Id: [0x00087BBA]
!*How little you understand... General Howe is on our side. Things aren't as black and white as you think.

Id: [0x00087BBB]
!*Achilles never told me there were Assassins in the British army.

Id: [0x00087BBC]
!*That was need to know information, and you didn't need to know... Until now. Now let's go find the guy.

Id: [0x00087BC1]
!*Don't you guys ever knock? I can't be seen with Assassins, I'd lose my commission.

Id: [0x00087BC2]
!*Don't worry, we only killed a dozen guys and a dog on the way in here.

Id: [0x00087BC3]
!*And you say the Templars are brutal. Alright, why are you here?

Id: [0x00087BC4]
!*We're looking for a box. It looks ancient and is covered with strange writing...

Id: [0x00087BC5]
!*You guys are good. Yes, I heard of a box like that. There's this fellow called Benjamin Franklin, odd but very smart. Likeable enough. Well, two soldiers here got orders from the top to liaison with him about some new research.

Id: [0x00087BC6]
!*You're the general, aren't you the top?

Id: [0x00087BC7]
!*Where do you get these kids?

Id: [0x00087BC8]
!*He means Grand Master Reginald Birch. That jackal is "advising" the British Army from a castle in France. The irony is sweet.

Id: [0x00087BC9]
!*I find it repulsive. So that's why I'm telling you, find those men and take their orders. I don't want to know how, I just want the Templars out of my army.

Id: [0x00087BCA]
!*What do you know, a British officer I can respect! This day is certainly full of wonders.

Id: [0x00087BCB]
!*You'll want to be getting out of here now.

Id: [0x00087BD1]
!*Let's go find those two men.

Id: [0x00087BD2]
!*Sounds good.

Id: [0x00087BD4]
!*So, if I may enter the territory of "need to know", who's Grand Master Birch? I mean, I know he's in charge of the Templars, but what's this man like?

Id: [0x00087BD5]
!*A strange, creepy fellow from all accounts. Reginald Birch spent years travelling through Europe, checking up on business with a caravan of rotating Templar staff. Apparently he didn't trust anyone enough to keep them on for more than a year or so. Oh, and took a dead Assassin's ten-year-old son as his ward and apprentice. Like I said, creepy.

Id: [0x00087BD6]
!*The Grand Master's apprentice is a ten-year-old boy?

Id: [0x00087BD7]
!*Oh no, this all happened about twenty years ago. The child grew up to be his second-in-command, as far as we can tell.

Id: [0x00087BD9]
!*You said that Birch's second-in-command was a dead Assassin's son. Did the Assassins just let the man keep the lad?

Id: [0x00087BDA]
!*Of course not! But from what I was told, so many Brothers were killed in the attempt to retrieve him that they had to give up. Apparently he killed some of his rescuers himself. That lad's a beast. I suppose he'll likely lead the Templars himself some day.

Id: [0x00087BDB]
!*I wonder how that works. Do you think they have an election or something?

Id: [0x00087BDC]
!*More like a knife in the back, I venture.

Id: [0x00087BE0]
What the devil is that?

Id: [0x00087BEB]
{556011}{556011}{556011}So what's a lady like you doing in a respectable place like this?

Id: [0x00087BF0]
{556016}{556016}{556016}Why hello, Shay. Your lovely associate mentioned you were on your way.

Id: [0x00087BF1]
{556017}{556017}{556017}We have been discussing the artifacts. I trust you have them?

Id: [0x00087BF4]
{556020}{556020}{556020}What is this?

Id: [0x00087BF5]
{556021}{556021}{556021}A Leyden jar. It temporarily stores power in the form of vitreous and resinous electricity.

Id: [0x00087BF6]
{556022}{556022}{556022}I see.

Id: [0x00087BF7]
{556023}{556023}{556023}Oh yes, once one of those nearly knocked me across the room when I touched the contacts wrong. But working with them has given me many insights about electrical power.

Id: [0x00087BF8]
{556024}{556024}{556024}We are in need of power, actually.

Id: [0x00087BF9]
{556025}{556025}{556025}I have been working on a way of combining these jars into an energy storage system. It is made up of many units firing at once, so I call it a "battery". It should make your interpretation box operate.

Id: [0x00087BFB]
{556027}{556027}{556027}Praying for your misguided soul.

Id: [0x00087BFC]
{556028}{556028}{556028}Oh, you need not waste your time. The Devil's already spoken for it.

Id: [0x00087BFD]
{556029}{556029}{556029}It is good to see you Shay. But this is not a social call, is it?

Id: [0x00087BFE]
{556030}{556030}{556030}I have a name but no location. And you know where everyone is in this town...

Id: [0x00087BFF]
{556031}{556031}{556031}Everyone worth knowing. Who is it?

Id: [0x00087C00]
{556032}{556032}{556032}I need to find Benjamin Franklin.

Id: [0x00087C01]
{556033}{556033}{556033}He's in Philadelphia. No, wait, I did hear something about him coming to New York. My man Hendrick van Slyke could tell you, but he has gotten himself into a bit of trouble.

Id: [0x00087C02]
{556034}{556034}{556034}What sort of trouble?

Id: [0x00087C03]
{556035}{556035}{556035}He is being held captive. We are friends with the man in authority, General Howe, but his hands are tied.

Id: [0x00087C04]
{556036}{556036}{556036}Free Hendrick, say hello to Howe. I could do that... but I need better gear if I'm to walk into a military camp.

Id: [0x00087C05]
{556037}{556037}{556037}Well, there is a shop just around the corner.

Id: [0x00087C0A]
{556042}{556042}{556042}Hey there! You in the hood!

Id: [0x00087C0B]
{556043}{556043}{556043}Did Hope send you? Quick, break the lock and get me out of here!

Id: [0x00087C0F]
{556047}{556047}{556047}Follow my lead.

Id: [0x00087C10]
{556048}{556048}{556048}I will...

Id: [0x00087C11]
{556049}{556049}{556049}I'm Shay. Just keep up.

Id: [0x00087C13]
{556051}{556051}{556051}So, I hear you know a man named Franklin.

Id: [0x00087C14]
{556052}{556052}{556052}Oh yes, the inventor. Someone is courting him to develop weapons.

Id: [0x00087C15]
{556053}{556053}{556053}Is he any good at that, building weapons?

Id: [0x00087C16]
{556054}{556054}{556054}It's not his cup of tea, but I suppose he could. If you want to meet him, you should do him a favor. He is a busy man and will not be interrupted by just anyone.

Id: [0x00087C17]
{556055}{556055}{556055}I'll keep that in mind.

Id: [0x00087C18]
{556056}{556056}{556056}Enough sport, I must get back to business. Thank you for your help, Shay.

Id: [0x00087C19]
{556057}{556057}{556057}Thank you Shay, I will remember you.

Id: [0x00087C1A]
{556058}{556058}{556058}And I you, Hendrick. Give my regards to Hope.

Id: [0x00087C20]
{556064}{556064}{556064}General.

Id: [0x00087C21]
{556065}{556065}{556065}What?

Id: [0x00087C22]
{556066}{556066}{556066}Ah. I suppose none of you Assassins knock.

Id: [0x00087C23]
{556067}{556067}{556067}Just a bad habit. Didn't think I would find a friendly face here.

Id: [0x00087C24]
{556068}{556068}{556068}The Templars are spreading throughout His Majesty's army, deciding our strategies at the highest levels. I want to restore our dignity and get them out of this institution.

Id: [0x00087C25]
{556069}{556069}{556069}An officer I can respect? Will wonders never cease.

Id: [0x00087C26]
{556070}{556070}{556070}I am sure you are not here just to malign my colleagues.

Id: [0x00087C27]
{556071}{556071}{556071}I need to find a man. Benjamin Franklin.

Id: [0x00087C28]
{556072}{556072}{556072}Indeed. One of those puppet masters has requested his aid... A man will be leaving this camp soon to deliver a small package to his laboratory. Follow him and you will find Franklin.

Id: [0x00087C29]
{556073}{556073}{556073}Thank you, and good luck rooting out the Templars.

Id: [0x00087C2A]
{556074}{556074}{556074}Good luck to you, Assassin.

Id: [0x00087C2C]
{556076}{556076}{556076}Well this is a bit of trouble. Which one is heading to see Franklin? I had best follow both.

Id: [0x00087C30]
{556080}{556080}{556080}Good, that other fellow must be off to Franklin's laboratory. Better be quick and catch him.

Id: [0x00087C34]
{556084}{556084}{556084}"Dear Master Franklin, please do me the courtesy of accepting these research assistants..." Perfect, this is a letter of introduction. Now to say how-do-you-do.

Id: [0x00087C36]
{556086}{556086}{556086}Who are you?

Id: [0x00087C37]
{556087}{556087}{556087}Shay, sir. Here is the--

Id: [0x00087C38]
{556088}{556088}{556088}Ah! The copper foil for my Leyden jar! Please give my thanks to Master Washington.

Id: [0x00087C39]
{556089}{556089}{556089}Of course, sir... Anything else?

Id: [0x00087C3A]
{556090}{556090}{556090}Perhaps you could relay a message for me?[beat, quickly] You see, electrical fire is the key! If I am correct I will be able to give that curious device the spark of life.

Id: [0x00087C3B]
{556091}{556091}{556091}I see.

Id: [0x00087C3C]
{556092}{556092}{556092}A most curious device. I am currently researching how to give it the spark of life. I believe electrical fire is the key.

Id: [0x00087C3D]
{556093}{556093}{556093}Master Franklin.

Id: [0x00087C3E]
{556094}{556094}{556094}Of course not! I returned it along with the manuscript.[realizing he may have said too much] Forget I said anything. My research will take months to complete...

Id: [0x00087C4D]
{556109}{556109}{556109}Oh, and if you find yourself near Mount Vernon, do tell Washington I am not quite done yet, but will send my latest invention in a few days.

Id: [0x00087C4E]
{556110}{556110}{556110}I will pass along the message.

Id: [0x00087C4F]
{556111}{556111}{556111}I suppose this new invention was commissioned by the Templars.(sarcastically) It would be a shame for it to fall into Assassin hands...

Id: [0x00087C54]
They have also approached many tribes with questions.

Id: [0x00087C55]
Yeah, they've been showing that Manuscript far and wide, no one can read the strange writing or understand the images. We do have a name though.

Id: [0x00087C56]
{556118}{556118}{556118}They have Benjamin Franklin doing research for them.

Id: [0x00087C57]
{556119}{556119}{556119}Franklin mentioned someone by the name of Washington. He may have the artifacts.

Id: [0x00087C58]
{556120}{556120}{556120}Lawrence Washington... Head of the Ohio Company, up-and-comer in the Virginian political scene, and high-ranking Templar.

Id: [0x00087C59]
{556121}{556121}{556121}What should we do next?

Id: [0x00087C5A]
{556122}{556122}{556122}Then you must follow that package. Find Washington and learn all you can.

Id: [0x00087C5D]
!*Ha ha!

Id: [0x00087C5E]
!*Ha ha!

Id: [0x00087C60]
!*By the devil it is cold out here!

Id: [0x00087C61]
!*Indeed it is as cold as the tits of Satan's wives.

Id: [0x00087C62]
!*I wonder how many wives he has?

Id: [0x00087C63]
!*At least forty I reckon.

Id: [0x00087C64]
!*Lucky devil.

Id: [0x00087CB9]
!*So, what's happening?

Id: [0x00087CBA]
!*Liam, this is the most BORING MAN IN THE WORLD! George Washington is a great big nothing! He knows nothing and does nothing!

Id: [0x00087CBB]
!*Shay, there has to be something special about him.

Id: [0x00087CBC]
!*Well, he is sending some pretty hot notes to a married chick. But even that seems pretty hopeless.

Id: [0x00087CBD]
!*Well, stick with him. His brother was a bigshot, someone in the Templars has to contact him eventually.

Id: [0x00087CC0]
!*"To whom it may concern..." "Hello nephew, how's the army?" "My dearest fondling father..." OK, the Assassins don't pay me enough to read this crap.

Id: [0x00087CC2]
!*"Dear George, there is some business pertaining to your late brother we should discuss. Meet us at the usual place at noon on Monday." Now that sounds interesting.

Id: [0x00087CC5]
!*Oh no, I'll be late!

Id: [0x00087CC6]
!*I'd better hurry up and follow him.

Id: [0x00087CC8]
!*Hi, I'm here!

Id: [0x00087CC9]
!*Me too!

Id: [0x00087CCA]
!*So, what do you guys want with me?

Id: [0x00087CCB]
!*Do you have a moment to discuss the Father of Understanding?

Id: [0x00087CCC]
!*For the seventy-eighth time, I'm not joining the Templars!

Id: [0x00087CCD]
!*Alright, fine. But you will help us out with some of your brother's stuff?

Id: [0x00087CCE]
!*Because it's for him, cool.

Id: [0x00087CCF]
!*Alright, here's some info about the artifact we found.

Id: [0x00087CD0]
!*I'm getting the box next week!

Id: [0x00087CD1]
!*Good for you, Smith. Maybe there will be a Precursor cookie inside.

Id: [0x00087CD2]
!*Yay magic cookies!

Id: [0x00087CD3]
!*Next target: Samuel Smith.

Id: [0x00087CD6]
{556246}{556246}{556246}Franklin said a package would soon be on its way to him.

Id: [0x00087CDA]
!*You go on ahead, I'll stay here and watch the road.

Id: [0x00087CDE]
!*Do you need something, brother? Some tea, some treacle for your throat?

Id: [0x00087CDF]
!*No, thank you George.(coughs) You're doing a fine job of playing nursemaid.

Id: [0x00087CE0]
!*I'd rather play hunting guide. I saw a flock of pheasants this morning. We could have brought in ten brace together.

Id: [0x00087CE1]
!*Ah, then Amy in the kitchen would curse us for all the work we'd make her do dressing them.

Id: [0x00087CE3]
!*George, I think I would like some of that treacle actually. Could you go in and get me some, with ginger in it?

Id: [0x00087CE4]
!*Of course. I'll be right back.

Id: [0x00087CE5]
!*Take your time.

Id: [0x00087CE7]
!*Come out, Assassin.

Id: [0x00087CE9]
!*After an easy target?

Id: [0x00087CEA]
!*Not at all. I aim for the head.

Id: [0x00087CEB]
!*Then you're in the wrong place.(pause) The Templars cut me adrift when it was clear I could be of no more use to them.

Id: [0x00087CEC]
!*Why should I believe you?

Id: [0x00087CED]
!*You don't have to, it doesn't matter.

Id: [0x00087CEE]
!*But this does. My brother, George, has nothing to do with this war. Stay away from him. He has no blood on his hands, and I want it to stay that way. He is not a man of the cross.

Id: [0x00087CEF]
!*I hear you.

Id: [0x00087CF0]
!*Then I have done all I can.(pause) "That thou doest, do quickly."

Id: [0x00087CF2]
!*I am no Judas. I do what has to be done.

Id: [0x00087CF5]
!*Why should I believe you?

Id: [0x00087CF8]
I make my own luck, Liam. And Washington is running out of his.

Id: [0x00087CF9]
We cannot let the Templars get control of these Colonies. Whatever happens, Lawrence Washington must not survive.

Id: [0x00087CFC]
I'll do that. Bring the Morrigan around another way.

Id: [0x00087CFD]
Aye, Cap'n.

Id: [0x00087D04]
Hurry up, lads! Master Washington will be here soon.

Id: [0x00087D05]
What is in this special package? The captain would tell us naught but that it was fragile.

Id: [0x00087D06]
Then you need know naught but that.

Id: [0x00087D07]
Come on, throw a dog a bone!

Id: [0x00087D08]
What makes you think I know?

Id: [0x00087D09]
{556297}{556297}{556297}Or fine china for a dinner party.

Id: [0x00087D0C]
Now, what's this?[Pause] A rifle?

Id: [0x00087D0F]
{556303}{556303}{556303}It looks nice enough. But what are all these strange geegaws attached?

Id: [0x00087D11]
{556305}{556305}{556305}Loads well.

Id: [0x00087D13]
{556307}{556307}{556307}Sights well.

Id: [0x00087D16]
{556310}{556310}{556310}How is that possible? It makes no sound.

Id: [0x00087D17]
{556311}{556311}{556311}So, where is my cargo?

Id: [0x00087D18]
Thanks for the present, Master Washington.

Id: [0x00087D1B]
{556315}{556315}{556315}Too many of them... I should pick a better moment to make Master Washington's acquaintance.

Id: [0x00087D1C]
{556316}{556316}{556316}I would like to see that crate, now.

Id: [0x00087D1D]
{556317}{556317}{556317}Of course, sir. I'll bring it right away.

Id: [0x00087D1F]
{556319}{556319}{556319}[coughing]

Id: [0x00087D20]
{556320}{556320}{556320}Bring it to the house.

Id: [0x00087D29]
Brother, are you sure you shouldn't be in bed?

Id: [0x00087D2A]
I am fine, George.

Id: [0x00087D2B]
{556331}{556331}{556331}Is there nothing I can do?

Id: [0x00087D2C]
Be a good host for my sake. Go to the wine cellar and get something special for our guests.

Id: [0x00087D2D]
I will.

Id: [0x00087D2F]
{556335}{556335}{556335}Gentlemen, my brother is a bright spot in a troubled land. If I may make one request before I depart this life, please leave him in peace. He should have nothing to do with the troubles of the Templar cause.

Id: [0x00087D30]
{556336}{556336}{556336}I think we can all respect that sentiment, Master Washington.

Id: [0x00087D32]
{556338}{556338}{556338}You have my thanks, gentlemen. Master Smith, are you ready to leave on your voyage?

Id: [0x00087D33]
{556339}{556339}{556339}Yes, sir. I shall return with answers.

Id: [0x00087D34]
{556340}{556340}{556340}Take a year if you must. We must learn what that box can do.

Id: [0x00087D35]
{556341}{556341}{556341}Aye sir.

Id: [0x00087D36]
{556342}{556342}{556342}Master Wardrop, are you likewise engaged with the manuscript?

Id: [0x00087D37]
{556343}{556343}{556343}Yes, Master Washington. Be it a code or a barbarous tongue we will soon know its meaning.

Id: [0x00087D38]
{556344}{556344}{556344}Then, gentlemen, I bid you take your leave.

Id: [0x00087D3A]
{556346}{556346}{556346}Master Washington, would you like to retire for the evening?

Id: [0x00087D3B]
{556347}{556347}{556347}No, I should put in an appearance.

Id: [0x00087D43]
I need to get to Washington first. Then I'll worry about the artifacts.

Id: [0x00087D4A]
You are too late, Assassin.

Id: [0x00087D4B]
It's never too late to ruin Templar plans, Master Washington.

Id: [0x00087D4C]
[coughs]Ah, Ah... but my plans are already in motion. Even leading you here[coughs]... has given my allies time to escape.

Id: [0x00087D4D]
{556365}{556365}{556365}I will track them down and stop them.

Id: [0x00087D4E]
[coughs]Thank you for... making my end a quick one.

Id: [0x00087D50]
And thank you for revealing your master plan, you scheming snake.

Id: [0x00087D55]
{556373}{556373}{556373}You should go train, Shay. I will see you later.

Id: [0x00087D56]
Who's our visitor?

Id: [0x00087D57]
That's Adéwalé. He was a slave who freed himself and hundreds of his brothers in the West Indies. That man's a living incarnation of the Creed.

Id: [0x00087D68]
{556392}{556392}{556392}A great hunter you have become.

Id: [0x00087D73]
{556403}{556403}{556403}Learn to move silently and blend into crowds. Follow me.

Id: [0x00087D79]
{556409}{556409}{556409}Are you leaving already?

Id: [0x00087D7A]
My ship awaits, Achilles. The people of Haiti will make good use of your supplies.[beat] I trust you will retrieve what has been lost.

Id: [0x00087D7B]
{556411}{556411}{556411}To help recover from the earthquake?

Id: [0x00087D7C]
{556412}{556412}{556412}I do not recall...(deciding not to push the matter) Yes, that and other concerns.(to ACHILLES) I trust you will retrieve what has been lost.

Id: [0x00087D7D]
Lost?

Id: [0x00087D7E]
The Templars stole two precious artifacts. A manuscript of ancient wisdom, and a box that allows one to understand its language.

Id: [0x00087D7F]
{556415}{556415}{556415}There was also a kind of engine that made the box come alive. But it was broken and must be replaced.

Id: [0x00087D80]
{556416}{556416}{556416}Do we know where the Templars brought these things?

Id: [0x00087D82]
I have tracked the Templars as far as this coast, but I fear the rest is up to you my friend...

Id: [0x00087D87]
!*Are you leaving already?

Id: [0x00087D88]
!*I must. I am needed in Haiti.

Id: [0x00087D89]
!*To help recover from the earthquake, Adéwalé?

Id: [0x00087D8A]
!*I do not recall having mentioned that to you... But yes, that and finding what has been stolen from us.

Id: [0x00087D8B]
!*What exactly has been stolen?

Id: [0x00087D8C]
!*The Templars stole a set of powerful artifacts. A manuscript of ancient wisdom, and a box that allows one to understand the language in which it is written.

Id: [0x00087D8D]
!*There was also a kind of engine, or heart, that made the box come alive. But it was broken and must be replaced.

Id: [0x00087D8E]
!*Do we know where the Templars brought these things?

Id: [0x00087D8F]
!*We are not sure, but we suspect they are still on this side of the Atlantic.

Id: [0x00087D91]
!*I hesitate to burden you with details, but I must share with you some matters of grave concern for both this Colonial Brotherhood, and our brothers around the world.

Id: [0x00087D92]
!*What is the matter, Mentor?

Id: [0x00087D93]
!*A set of powerful artifacts from the First Civilization has been stolen, and I am afraid they are in the hands of the Templars.

Id: [0x00087D95]
!*Adéwalé, who as you know is late arrived from Haiti, can tell you more.

Id: [0x00087D96]
!*Thank you, Achilles. The Haitian Brotherhood recently found a manuscript of great importance. We believe it was dictated, or at least inspired, by Those Who Came Before.

Id: [0x00087D97]
!*What's written in it?

Id: [0x00087D98]
!*Many things. It is full of signs and symbols we cannot completely interpret yet. But so far we can understand one thing, a map.

Id: [0x00087D99]
!*This map shows sites of power found, or founded, by the First Civilization. Temples, as it were. We believe these sites contain power to affect the very planet itself.

Id: [0x00087D9A]
!*One of them was near Haiti. We sent a young man to investigate, but his ill-fortuned voyage was interrupted by an earthquake.

Id: [0x00087D9B]
!*We can only assume that the temple located at that spot was terribly damaged by the earthquake. We must move on to the other locations... But the map and its associated artifacts are missing.

Id: [0x00087D9C]
!*Associated artifacts?

Id: [0x00087D9D]
!*There is a box, another gift from Those Who Came Before, that lets us read the manuscript clearly. And a core that provides energy to bring the box to life. But that core is not only lost, it is broken, shattered in the earthquake.

Id: [0x00087D9E]
!*So even though the Templars have this manuscript and box, they're missing the heart that lets them understand what they have?

Id: [0x00087D9F]
!*Yes, but not necessarily for long. The world is full of strange things, both from the First Civilization and men's minds. We can't assume they won't find a way to make the manuscript clear again.

Id: [0x00087DA0]
!*That is why we must stop the Templars and retrieve the artifacts. We cannot risk them finding and controlling these temples.

Id: [0x00087DA1]
{556449}{556449}{556449}Why are these artifacts so important?

Id: [0x00087DA2]
{556450}{556450}{556450}Whoever controls them can access sites of power deep within the earth.

Id: [0x00087DA3]
Farewell, Adéwalé.[beat] Whoever controls the artifacts can access Precursor sites of power. We must recover them or none are safe.

Id: [0x00087DC2]
{556482}{556482}{556482}We have a long voyage ahead. You, go ready the ship!

Id: [0x00087DC3]
I see...

Id: [0x00087DC4]
You join me for some practice.

Id: [0x00087DC6]
Well done, Shay. Keep it up.

Id: [0x00087DCA]
So Liam, what can you tell me about Adéwalé? You obviously admire the man.

Id: [0x00087DCB]
Aye. I had the honor of working with him once. I've never known anyone who'd done so much for our cause... but it's more than that.

Id: [0x00087DCC]
Calico who?

Id: [0x00087DCD]
Oh, read a book, will you.

Id: [0x00087DCE]
{556494}{556494}{556494}What about the Haitian Brotherhood? Who is this Mackandal fellow?

Id: [0x00087DCF]
{556495}{556495}{556495}...

Id: [0x00087DD3]
How trustworthy are the pirates?

Id: [0x00087DD4]
I consider them brothers, Shay. When the time comes, they will lend aid and help us fight the Templars.[more to himself] If only the Rosbif would realize the Templars were pulling their strings.

Id: [0x00087DD5]
And what about the spy we're meeting?

Id: [0x00087DD6]
{556502}{556502}{556502}Le Chasseur is an old friend, and a very resourceful man. I trust him with my life. In fact I trust him more than I trust you.

Id: [0x00087DD7]
{556503}{556503}{556503}I'm hurt, Chevalier. I may not like you, but you know I have your back.

Id: [0x00087DD8]
{556504}{556504}{556504}And you would as soon thrust a knife in it, no doubt...(sighing) But we are both sworn to obey Achilles. And I will work with you, if I must.

Id: [0x00087DD9]
You need not worry about Le Chasseur. He is loyal to the Brotherhood. As it happens, he also has "friends" in both the French and English fleets, and he knows more about what goes on in these parts than you can ever hope to learn.

Id: [0x00087DDA]
{556506}{556506}{556506}I'm glad I asked.

Id: [0x00087DDB]
{556507}{556507}{556507}...

Id: [0x00087DDC]
{556508}{556508}{556508}...

Id: [0x00087DDD]
{556509}{556509}{556509}...

Id: [0x00087DDE]
Are the Templars truly in control in the Colonies?

Id: [0x00087DDF]
Not quite, but their influence reaches far and wide.

Id: [0x00087DE7]
{556519}{556519}{556519}What about you, Shay?

Id: [0x00087DEB]
I will teach you some manners, boy.

Id: [0x00087DEC]
Some of the men you rescued agreed to join us. They should prove a good crew.

Id: [0x00087DEF]
Have your skills actually grown, Shay?[beat] Oh, do not get a swelled head over it.

Id: [0x00087E06]
About 20 years ago, Adéwalé intercepted a Templar convoy and stole a mysterious package. He traveled to Port-au-Prince, and entrusted it to a woman he believed was loyal to our cause.

Id: [0x00087E07]
What was it? The package I mean.

Id: [0x00087E08]
The very box we're seeking.

Id: [0x00087E09]
{556553}{556553}{556553}What is it then?

Id: [0x00087E0A]
{556554}{556554}{556554}Adéwalé...(unable to find the words)

Id: [0x00087E0B]
Adéwalé was already a [FR][légende](legend) before joining the Brotherhood.[proudly] He was a pirate -- the scourge of the West Indies! -- rubbing elbows with the likes of Blackbeard, Woodes Rogers, and Calico Jack Rackham.

Id: [0x00087E0E]
Let me guess, she wasn't?

Id: [0x00087E0F]
And she was. Very much so. The package eventually found its way to François Mackandal, Mentor of the Haitian Brotherhood.

Id: [0x00087E1F]
She's a mess, but she's still afloat.[in wonder] And her name's the Morrigan.

Id: [0x00087E26]
Soon. I've got other business first.

Id: [0x00087E2F]
I will take the high ground and provide a distraction. Find another way.

Id: [0x00087E30]
{556592}{556592}{556592}Then let's be off.

Id: [0x00087E94]
{556692}{556692}{556692}Listen to me! We'll stay afloat if we all pull together! I promise you, we'll sail clear out into the Atlantic!

Id: [0x00087ECB]
{556747}{556747}{556747}So, what happened?

Id: [0x00087ECC]
Lawrence Washington is dead.

Id: [0x00087ECD]
You look disappointed.

Id: [0x00087ECE]
The sickly way that man looked, he would have been dead in a month anyway. And two other Templars got away. They're looking into the Manuscript and Box.

Id: [0x00087ECF]
Then you did what was right by the Brotherhood. We can find the objects later. Cheer up, Shay. It's a rare day we can sow such chaos among the Templars.

Id: [0x00087ED0]
Perhaps. But to hear Washington speak, it didn't sound like they'd be too put out by the loss.

Id: [0x00087ED1]
Well, that's what he'd want you to think.

Id: [0x00087ED9]
Shay! I hear you've become quite the marksman.[giving SHAY two pistols]

Id: [0x00087EDA]
A generous gift. Thank you, mentor.

Id: [0x00087EE3]
Did they have the artifacts?

Id: [0x00087EE4]
I don't know... Perhaps... I can't be sure.

Id: [0x00087EE5]
{556773}{556773}{556773}He believes his jar of electricity -- if he makes it work -- could invigorate the Precursor box. But it could take him months to complete his research.

Id: [0x00087EED]
It may not be much longer. Le Chasseur has a lead on the Precursor box now.

Id: [0x00087EEE]
{556782}{556782}{556782}Chevalier's man. The one who told us he saw the manuscript in Templar hands. What about him?

Id: [0x00087EF1]
{556785}{556785}{556785}Chevalier sent word. Le Chasseur has a lead on the box now.

Id: [0x00087EF2]
No wonder Chevalier spoke so highly of him.

Id: [0x00087EF3]
We're to meet both of them in Saint John's.

Id: [0x00087EF6]
Both of them?[sigh] And the day started off so well.

Id: [0x00087EF7]
Ah yah. I suppose it is... Except that it interprets the strange language of the manuscript too. If the plate were of a banner in Latin, we'd see it in English.

Id: [0x00087EFC]
{556796}{556796}{556796}Better hurry, Shay. I'll restock the Morrigan. She'll be ready when you return.

Id: [0x00087EFD]
{556797}{556797}{556797}Captain.[beat] Where is your ship?

Id: [0x00087EFE]
{556798}{556798}{556798}In town.(curt) You will have to find him.

Id: [0x00087EFF]
{556799}{556799}{556799}I live to serve, Chevalier de la Verendrye.

Id: [0x00087F00]
{556800}{556800}{556800}Then find Le Chasseur. He has a lead on the mysterious box and that man Samuel Smith you mentioned.

Id: [0x00087F04]
{556804}{556804}{556804}We live in trying times. This cannot wait.

Id: [0x00087F05]
{556805}{556805}{556805}Indeed. I have located the sailor Samuel Smith. He has been busy.

Id: [0x00087F06]
{556806}{556806}{556806}My sources informed me that Samuel Smith has searched long and wide, looking for answers on how to make that strange box work. He just returned from Europe.

Id: [0x00087F07]
{556807}{556807}{556807}Where is he now?

Id: [0x00087F0A]
{556810}{556810}{556810}Refitting his schooner. If you hurry, you will catch him...(pointing on the map) there.

Id: [0x00087F0B]
{556811}{556811}{556811}Shay Cormac. Louis-Joseph told me you would be coming.

Id: [0x00087F0C]
{556812}{556812}{556812}How so?

Id: [0x00087F0E]
[Sigh]You're here. The Congress is still in session. George Washington and his militia have fired on French troops under Jumonville. The French are calling it an act of war.

Id: [0x00087F0F]
{556815}{556815}{556815}Politicians, one thing they never run out of is words.

Id: [0x00087F10]
{556816}{556816}{556816}They have much to talk about. George Washington and his militia have fired on French troops at Jumonville Glen. The French are calling it an act of war.

Id: [0x00087F11]
George Washington, you mean Lawrence's younger brother?

Id: [0x00087F12]
Yeah, it's the same... Speaking of Lawrence Washington, since you eliminated him, James Wardrop has moved up in the ranks. All the Templars' resources are at his disposal now.

Id: [0x00087F13]
{556819}{556819}{556819}Shall we leave the bigger questions for later, gentlemen? Shay, focus on getting that manuscript.

Id: [0x00087F15]
Ah... that must be the Templar William Johnson. Perhaps he has the Manuscript, or knows where it is.

Id: [0x00087F19]
As I have stated previously, I believe we need a national union, granted by an act of Parliament but bringing greater independence to our colonies. The French are an immediate threat and we are ill-prepared to face them. To put it bluntly, the colonies must join, or die.

Id: [0x00087F1B]
A rousing speech, Master Franklin. But do you truly believe Great Britain will grant her colonies autonomy?

Id: [0x00087F1C]
They have little choice, Master Johnson. You know the remoteness of this frontier better than most.

Id: [0x00087F1D]
Yes... But let us leave politics for another day. I wanted to thank you for your research--

Id: [0x00087F1E]
Of course, of course! In the brief time I could examine that box, I could tell it was something unique. From Ancient Egypt, you said? Well, as I mentioned in my letter, I am quite ready to electrify it...

Id: [0x00087F1F]
Excellent. We will have the box delivered shortly. As for the manuscript...[to a nearby British soldier] Captain!

Id: [0x00087F20]
I am apologize, sir, but Master Wardrop refused to hand it over. He said the risks were too great.

Id: [0x00087F21]
The risks!?

Id: [0x00087F23]
{556835}{556835}{556835}Oh, remember those blueprints? Well, I had an engineer build that marvelous weapon. I will have it delivered to your ship.

Id: [0x00087F25]
Ah... I apologize. You will have the manuscript and box in the briefest of delays.

Id: [0x00087F26]
You mangy excuse for a uniform! Run to Fort Frederick and tell Master Wardrop he had better cough up that manuscript post-haste!  Else I will have him scalped!

Id: [0x00087F27]
[Effort]I'll take that, you Templar dog.

Id: [0x00087F28]
No! You have no idea what you are doing, fool.

Id: [0x00087F29]
Keeping the people free from your control.

Id: [0x00087F2A]
How free will you be when the French undermine these squabbling colonies?

Id: [0x00087F2B]
These colonies would be far better off without the Templars pulling the strings.

Id: [0x00087F2D]
[laughing]We bring order from chaos.[slyly] If everything is permitted, no one is safe.

Id: [0x00087F30]
{556848}{556848}{556848}...

Id: [0x00087F31]
{556849}{556849}{556849}...

Id: [0x00087F33]
{556851}{556851}{556851}But he doesn't have the box.

Id: [0x00087F34]
{556852}{556852}{556852}...

Id: [0x00087F36]
Then shall we, gentlemen?

Id: [0x00087F37]
You are in a [FR]jovial mood, Shay.

Id: [0x00087F38]
Why shouldn't I be? I have a new weapon, and will soon have the chance to use it.

Id: [0x00087F39]
{556857}{556857}{556857}Which you no doubt can't wait to try.

Id: [0x00087F3A]
{556858}{556858}{556858}These waters are teeming with enemy vessels. You will soon have the opportunity.

Id: [0x00087F3B]
What about Smith then? Is he close by?

Id: [0x00087F3C]
Aye, he sails these very waters. And he may have the Precursor box.

Id: [0x00087F3D]
Then lets find him!

Id: [0x00087F3E]
{556862}{556862}{556862}...

Id: [0x00087F3F]
{556863}{556863}{556863}...

Id: [0x00087F42]
{556866}{556866}{556866}Look, Captain! He's cutting through the ice!

Id: [0x00087F44]
{556868}{556868}{556868}Hurry! Hurry!

Id: [0x00087F46]
{556870}{556870}{556870}What devilry is this?

Id: [0x00087F47]
{556871}{556871}{556871}A Templar tactic. They nearly destroyed my ship once, just like that, but this old sea dog has more than one trick up his sleeve.

Id: [0x00087F48]
{556872}{556872}{556872}Better be careful, Shay. We don't know what this bilge rat will throw at us next.

Id: [0x00087F4A]
{556874}{556874}{556874}He's as crazy as you are, Captain.

Id: [0x00087F4B]
{556875}{556875}{556875}I sincerely doubt that.

Id: [0x00087F4C]
{556876}{556876}{556876}We almost have him!

Id: [0x00087F50]
{556880}{556880}{556880}[FR]Mon dieu! [My god!]

Id: [0x00087F5D]
This will be your end, Assassin!

Id: [0x00087F5E]
Kill him!

Id: [0x00087F60]
[Out of breath]This cannot be... [Pain vocals]

Id: [0x00087F63]
No![regaining composure, defeated] Do you... even know what... that is?

Id: [0x00087F64]
An ancient artifact, a treasure from Those Who Came Before.

Id: [0x00087F65]
[Struggling]Yes...[more to himself] It matters not...[cough] Some of the greatest scientific minds of all Europe could not... make it... work...

Id: [0x00087F66]
{556902}{556902}{556902}May the Lord have mercy on your soul, you vermin.

Id: [0x00087F68]
{556904}{556904}{556904}It'll be a tight fit, Captain. Guide her with care.

Id: [0x00087F69]
Somebody stop him!

Id: [0x00087F6B]
You will regret this!

Id: [0x00087F6D]
{556909}{556909}{556909}My lady.

Id: [0x00087F6F]
{556911}{556911}{556911}You have the box, sir?

Id: [0x00087F70]
I'll make sure he doesn't.

Id: [0x00087F72]
{556914}{556914}{556914}Smith is cutting through the ice!

Id: [0x00087F73]
{556915}{556915}{556915}Don't let up, Shay!

Id: [0x00087F75]
{556917}{556917}{556917}However, I am missing materials. I need a dozen precision-milled metal rods, exactly one-eighth of an inch in diameter.

Id: [0x00087F76]
{556918}{556918}{556918}I'll be back with them in an hour.

Id: [0x00087F77]
{556919}{556919}{556919}But how?

Id: [0x00087F78]
{556920}{556920}{556920}Have you ever heard of knitting needles?

Id: [0x00087F7A]
{556922}{556922}{556922}Then the only components left are the lightning rods themselves. I commissioned three from a local blacksmith. Could you please retrieve them, Shay? I will set up the equipment in the meanwhile. If I am reading the sky correctly, conditions will be perfect.

Id: [0x00087F7B]
{556923}{556923}{556923}Very well.

Id: [0x00087F7D]
{556925}{556925}{556925}But I told you, I already paid all my taxes!

Id: [0x00087F7E]
{556926}{556926}{556926}I doubt it. You menials are always hiding something.

Id: [0x00087F81]
{556929}{556929}{556929}I have nothing to hide, you pigs!

Id: [0x00087F82]
{556930}{556930}{556930}Do you hear what he called us?

Id: [0x00087F84]
{556932}{556932}{556932}Thank you! In my younger days I could have taken them alone.

Id: [0x00087F85]
{556933}{556933}{556933}Not to worry. I'm sorry to be brief, but Master Franklin sent me.

Id: [0x00087F86]
{556934}{556934}{556934}I was afraid of that. These expired fellows already seized Franklin's lightning rods yesterday. They probably left them at their camp.

Id: [0x00087F87]
{556935}{556935}{556935}Then I shall go claim my inheritance.

Id: [0x00087F88]
Yes it is, sir.

Id: [0x00087F89]
This storm's getting worse. Better hurry back to Franklin.

Id: [0x00087F8A]
Shay! Thank goodness, quick, help me with the rods.

Id: [0x00087F8C]
{556940}{556940}{556940}Sweet angels above...

Id: [0x00087F8D]
It's a map...[indicating the spot] Where is that?

Id: [0x00087F8E]
Portugal. Lisbon, I'd stake my life on it.

Id: [0x00087F90]
{556944}{556944}{556944}I will go tell Achilles. Good work, Shay. I suppose we shall meet at the docks.

Id: [0x00087F91]
{556945}{556945}{556945}Thank you, we shall.

Id: [0x00087F93]
Lisbon is near as large as London or Paris. Are you sure you can find this one place?

Id: [0x00087F94]
I saw it clear as day, Hope. It's a convent right close by the harbour.[hesitating] I might have visited the sisters once or twice...

Id: [0x00087F96]
Given your present knowledge of the site, this duty falls upon you.[beat] You understand what must be done?

Id: [0x00087F97]
We finally obtained a ship for crossing the ocean.[Beat] Have no worries, I will keep the Morrigan safe in New York.

Id: [0x00087F98]
Liam is unavailable at present. Your crew and ship await. Be careful, Shay. Pieces of Eden are powerful relics.

Id: [0x00087F99]
{556953}{556953}{556953}You know me, I won't take any foolish risks.

Id: [0x00087F9C]
Even the devil can quote scripture to suit his own purposes.

Id: [0x00087F9E]
{556958}{556958}{556958}Many thanks!

Id: [0x00087F9F]
{556959}{556959}{556959}Anything for my hooded friends.

Id: [0x00087FAA]
Hope! What did I miss?

Id: [0x00087FAB]
Only the first hour of training.

Id: [0x00087FAC]
We're always training, Kesegowaase!

Id: [0x00087FAE]
Hey!

Id: [0x00087FAF]
A pity, the boy has so much potential...[beat] But so little discipline.

Id: [0x00087FB0]
Alright, alright! What would you have me do?

Id: [0x00087FB1]
Well played.

Id: [0x00087FB4]
You are late.

Id: [0x00087FB5]
Do not waste your words. Shay abhors improvement as much as cats abhor leashes.

Id: [0x00087FB7]
!*Le Chasseur! It is good to see you again, [FR]mon ami!(my friend!)

Id: [0x00087FB8]
!*Louis Joseph! How goes the fur trade?

Id: [0x00087FB9]
!*Not well enough to put beef on our plates.

Id: [0x00087FBA]
!*If you want beef, raid more British brigs. They have barrels by the ton! But I doubt you are here for the food.

Id: [0x00087FBB]
!*We hear you have seen a strange manuscript.

Id: [0x00087FBC]
!*Indeed. I was paying a visit to a British ship of the line when I spied it. It was written in an exotic language I could not recognize. It looked very old and was full of drawings. Plants and animals out of an opium dream.

Id: [0x00087FBD]
!*Were there no charts? No maps?

Id: [0x00087FBE]
!*I am afraid not. There may have been some kind of code, but neither I nor the British could ken it.

Id: [0x00087FBF]
!*Where is the manuscript now?

Id: [0x00087FC0]
!*The man who brought it said he was taking it to Master Benjamin Franklin next.

Id: [0x00087FC1]
!*Who's that?

Id: [0x00087FC2]
!*An inventor. A queer fellow but very intelligent. If anyone could figure out those strange diagrams, it would be him.

Id: [0x00087FC3]
!*What manner of things does he invent?

Id: [0x00087FC4]
!*Oh, scientific instruments, tools for printers... I hear he is working with electrical fire now.

Id: [0x00087FC5]
!*Lightning?

Id: [0x00087FC6]
!*Yes. They say he is trying to trap lightning in a jar, to use it again later.

Id: [0x00087FC7]
!*Use it for what?

Id: [0x00087FC8]
!*Who knows?(beat) If you want more useful inventions, take a look at this.(showing the blueprint) I got these from the British, they are like nothing I have ever seen. I have no idea how someone would even build this.

Id: [0x00087FC9]
!*Let us discuss these blueprints further. The French could use more powerful arms.

Id: [0x00087FCA]
And will continue to do so.

Id: [0x00087FCE]
{557006}{557006}{557006}He's an inventor. A queer fellow but very intelligent, she said. If anyone could figure out those strange diagrams, it would be him.

Id: [0x00087FCF]
{557007}{557007}{557007}Who knows?

Id: [0x00087FD0]
It was written in an exotic language I did not recognize and was full of drawings. Plants and animals out of an opium dream.

Id: [0x00087FD1]
{557009}{557009}{557009}So, this Franklin fellow, what can you tell me about him?

Id: [0x00087FD7]
{557015}{557015}{557015}Not much, I'm afraid. All I know of him I learned from Hope.

Id: [0x00087FD8]
{557016}{557016}{557016}Of course you did.

Id: [0x00087FDA]
So, Louis-Joseph, how goes the fur trade?

Id: [0x00087FDB]
Not well enough to put beef on my family's plates.

Id: [0x00087FDC]
If you want beef, raid more British brigs. They're loaded down with barrels!

Id: [0x00087FDD]
Oh yes, their Irish farms yield much meat, don't they? Oh that is smart management, far better than the locals could do.

Id: [0x00087FE2]
So, what's the challenge today?

Id: [0x00087FE3]
Shooting straight and true. Here, you can use these.

Id: [0x00087FE5]
These are yours...

Id: [0x00087FE6]
Well I want you to have half a chance of succeeding.[beat] Go on.

Id: [0x00087FE9]
It's about time you showed up.

Id: [0x00087FEA]
Far be it from me to keep a lady waiting.

Id: [0x00087FEB]
I'm no lady here, don't you forget it! I'm your teacher...[smirking] and your better.

Id: [0x00087FEC]
Well some of that is true, at least.[beat] What will we be doing?

Id: [0x00087FED]
Exploring myriad ways to end a life.

Id: [0x00087FEF]
Shay. Follow me. It is time you learned to survive in the frontier.

Id: [0x00087FF0]
I think I've been managing well enough so far.

Id: [0x00087FF1]
Perhaps, but there is more I can teach you.

Id: [0x00087FF6]
Good. Now to use what you have taken from <br>nature.

Id: [0x00087FF9]
Perhaps. But we don't have the right to decide that future.

Id: [0x00087FFB]
The right? We have the responsibility!

Id: [0x00087FFC]
WE are responsible for killing innocents and destroying cities. This... mad grab for power.[beat] It ends now.

Id: [0x00087FFD]
I will not let you destroy everything we have built!

Id: [0x00088001]
Bloody hell!

Id: [0x00088002]
Where did that come from?

Id: [0x00088003]
God's wounds!

Id: [0x00088004]
Just what I needed.

Id: [0x00088005]
Thanks, may I have another?

Id: [0x00088006]
Missed me!

Id: [0x00088007]
Fuck!

Id: [0x00088008]
Oh now he shoots straight.

Id: [0x00088009]
Ah! Dammit.

Id: [0x0008800A]
Shay!

Id: [0x0008800B]
Give back the Manuscript, Shay. I'm sure Achilles--

Id: [0x0008800C]
I cannot. I will not let this happen again. All those souls lost...

Id: [0x0008800F]
I heard there was a fight up at the manor today.

Id: [0x00088010]
Who, the cook and the groom again?

Id: [0x00088011]
Especially since Abigail and Connor passed on. Happened while you were at sea. The man's been fearsome grim ever since.

Id: [0x00088013]
No, Cap'n Shay and Achilles! The Captain took a swing at the big guy.

Id: [0x00088014]
You're joking! Jesus, that man hasn't been right in the head since we left Lisbon.

Id: [0x00088015]
Can't blame him. I've been having nightmares about that earthquake every night.

Id: [0x00088016]
Still, attacking Master Achilles?

Id: [0x00088017]
Achilles' wife and son are dead? No, it can't be.

Id: [0x00088018]
It was the typhoid fever. Bless their souls.

Id: [0x00088019]
Bless them.

Id: [0x0008801B]
No...

Id: [0x00088067]
{557159}{557159}{557159}...

Id: [0x00088068]
{557160}{557160}{557160}...

Id: [0x00088069]
{557161}{557161}{557161}Like from Bible times?

Id: [0x0008806A]
{557162}{557162}{557162}Even earlier. Achilles says they built the Garden of Eden.

Id: [0x0008806B]
{557163}{557163}{557163}Balderdash! God built the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve.

Id: [0x0008806C]
{557164}{557164}{557164}It's... complicated. Imagine if the Apple that Eve ate wasn't a fruit that grew on a tree, but something that looked like an apple. It was crafted by ancient people. You'd know the good and evil in everyone's heart from it, and you'd be able to control their minds because of it.

Id: [0x0008806D]
{557165}{557165}{557165}Well that's just idiotic.[beat] How could Eve have eaten a manufactured apple? She'd have broken her teeth on it.

Id: [0x0008806E]
{557166}{557166}{557166}Perhaps I'm not wise enough to explain this.

Id: [0x00088071]
Like a magic lantern?

Id: [0x00088075]
{557173}{557173}{557173}I never thought I'd be an explorer.

Id: [0x00088076]
{557174}{557174}{557174}What do you mean?

Id: [0x00088077]
Liam, it's been months... and we've done little but look for this blasted Manuscript and Box!

Id: [0x00088078]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00088079]
You know, the magic lantern shows Father Connolly put on in the church basement. The box had a candle in it, I think. He put these little glass plates in front. Then we'd see images projected on the wall, like cathedrals in Rome, bright and near as big as life!

Id: [0x0008807A]
How is that possible?

Id: [0x0008807C]
Liam is a fool if he thinks I'll leave this be. Achilles cannot be trusted. He must never find another Precursor Temple.

Id: [0x0008807D]
Only one thing to do.

Id: [0x00088082]
I didn't realize there was a Brotherhood in Haiti.

Id: [0x00088083]
Yes, François Mackandal is their mentor. He gathers many of his Assassins from the Maroons.

Id: [0x00088084]
Those are escaped slaves and their children, right?

Id: [0x00088085]
They are. It's a shame, though. They escaped terrible conditions only to be killed in that earthquake.

Id: [0x00088086]
But... Haiti's a French colony, no?

Id: [0x00088087]
Aye, it is.

Id: [0x00088088]
And here, the Assassins are helping King Louis. But in Haiti, the French own the slaves who are set free by the Assassins.

Id: [0x00088089]
Our struggle is beyond political borders, Shay.

Id: [0x0008808A]
{557194}{557194}{557194}Seems to me that's a fancy way of saying we're a right bunch of hypocrites.

Id: [0x0008808D]
{557197}{557197}{557197}We have to get out of the harbor before these waves get worse!

Id: [0x0008808E]
{557198}{557198}{557198}Come on men, put your backs into it!

Id: [0x0008808F]
{557199}{557199}{557199}We're almost in open water, hold her together boys!

Id: [0x00088090]
Who knows. I fear we might never truly understand how any of the Pieces of Eden work.

Id: [0x0008809A]
Now all I need is the Manuscript and all should be revealed.

Id: [0x0008809C]
{557212}{557212}{557212}Farewell, Master Wardrop. It's been[beat] pleasant.

Id: [0x0008809D]
{557213}{557213}{557213}Likewise, Weeks. If your master asks, tell him I am keeping the manuscript safely in my possession. I will not let it out of my sight.

Id: [0x0008809E]
{557214}{557214}{557214}I will report that,[beat] sir.

Id: [0x000880A1]
Make yourself scarce, Shay. The militia will be here any minute. I'm sure they will have questions.

Id: [0x000880A2]
What about you?

Id: [0x000880A3]
Right.

Id: [0x000880A8]
{557224}{557224}{557224}Captain, what shall we do?

Id: [0x000880A9]
{557225}{557225}{557225}Captain? Captain!

Id: [0x000880B1]
Find the Precursor Temple and retrieve the Piece of Eden.

Id: [0x000880B2]
Thank you. Liam and I will leave straight away.

Id: [0x00088120]
{557344}{557344}{557344}Hope's been spending a lot of time in New York lately. I barely see her anymore.

Id: [0x00088121]
{557345}{557345}{557345}Achilles has her on a long term assignment there. She's making "connections" between various factions.

Id: [0x00088122]
{557346}{557346}{557346}How do you mean?

Id: [0x00088123]
{557347}{557347}{557347}There is a certain, how shall I say this, "criminal" element in New York.

Id: [0x00088124]
{557348}{557348}{557348}Oh, I'm sure. Like in Dublin.

Id: [0x00088125]
{557349}{557349}{557349}Yes, well, some of these factions are getting organized. There's over ten thousand people living there now. More arriving every year.

Id: [0x00088126]
{557350}{557350}{557350}And when there's so many sheep to fleece, the criminals need to get organized.

Id: [0x00088127]
{557351}{557351}{557351}Hope says they're divided into three main groups. Muscle for hire, thieves and burglars, and ladies of the night.

Id: [0x00088128]
{557352}{557352}{557352}Hope's awful lady-like to be associated with that sort.

Id: [0x00088129]
{557353}{557353}{557353}She has a job to do.

Id: [0x0008812B]
You mean like Precursors?

Id: [0x0008812C]
Well that's different, Shay. The Precursors lived thousands of years ago.

Id: [0x0008812D]
Aye, I know.

Id: [0x0008812E]
They died out in the olden days, but have had great influence on the whole of humanity.

Id: [0x00088131]
Liam, have you ever spied a mermaid?

Id: [0x00088132]
I don't think they exist.

Id: [0x00088133]
So... Are you telling me that Queen Morrigan was a Precursor?

Id: [0x00088135]
How can that be? It makes no sound.

Id: [0x00088141]
Will there be an exam on this, schoolmaster?

Id: [0x00088142]
Athens. Named after Athena. The Ancient Greeks called her a goddess, but she could have been a Precursor. Many of the old gods might have been.

Id: [0x00088144]
Perhaps...

Id: [0x00088145]
I suppose it depends on your vision of beauty. A damsel from Corfu and one from Oslo are as different as chalk and cheese but, both can be lovely.

Id: [0x00088148]
You see, opinions like that give a man a reputation for wisdom.

Id: [0x00088149]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0008814C]
When Achilles said whoever had the artifacts could access sites of great power, what did he mean?

Id: [0x0008814D]
I'm not sure I understand it myself, Shay. I had a long talk with Adéwalé about that. He believes the Box can be activated to, well, project words or images...

Id: [0x00088175]
Where in the world has the most beautiful girls?

Id: [0x00088176]
I would have just said Havana. The girls there have lusty buttocks and bosoms and feel no shame in putting them on display! But that's no slight against our lasses from home.

Id: [0x00088177]
Opinions like that give a man an entirely different reputation.

Id: [0x00088178]
I think Galway has the nicest ones, fair and modest, always willing to spot you a penny for an ale.

Id: [0x00088179]
You don't say.

Id: [0x0008817A]
And then there's the maids I met in Lisbon. Destined for the convent they were, dark-eyed and kindly-dispositioned. If only I spoke Portuguese... Not that we spent much of our nights talking.

Id: [0x0008817C]
{557436}{557436}{557436}James Wardrop... The fellow Lawrence Washington gave the Manuscript to. What manner of a man is he?

Id: [0x0008817D]
{557437}{557437}{557437}He's quite the opposite. He uses the letter of the law to serve his purposes, and when the law does not bend to him, he gets lawmakers to bend it for him.

Id: [0x0008817E]
{557438}{557438}{557438}He is a bureaucrat with little regard for the effect of his actions.

Id: [0x0008817F]
I suppose...

Id: [0x00088180]
{557440}{557440}{557440}I had word from Hope recently: Master Franklin is still working on a way to invigorate that box.

Id: [0x00088181]
{557441}{557441}{557441}Well, no. Franklin's experiments are dangerous, so he is using models instead of the artifact itself.

Id: [0x00088182]
{557442}{557442}{557442}I suppose that's prudent.

Id: [0x00088183]
{557443}{557443}{557443}It also gives the Templars a chance to ask the opinion of other scientists. Our Brothers in Switzerland spotted Smith visiting a mathematician named Daniel Bernouilli.

Id: [0x00088184]
{557444}{557444}{557444}I wonder what a mathematician does all day.

Id: [0x00088185]
{557445}{557445}{557445}Maths, I imagine.

Id: [0x00088188]
Achilles.

Id: [0x00088189]
Adéwalé! How go things in the West Indies?

Id: [0x0008818D]
{557453}{557453}{557453}Gentlemen.

Id: [0x00088192]
{557458}{557458}{557458}Le Chasseur.

Id: [0x00088193]
{557459}{557459}{557459}I got myself into a bit of a scrape. Sent three ships and all hands to their watery graves, but (FR)Le Gerfaut suffered heavy damage.

Id: [0x00088194]
I will join you on this voyage.

Id: [0x00088196]
{557462}{557462}{557462}What about Le Chasseur?

Id: [0x00088197]
{557463}{557463}{557463}Captain.(beat) What happened to your ship?

Id: [0x00088198]
Captain?

Id: [0x0008819A]
Shay, find Wardrop, get that Manuscript.

Id: [0x0008819B]
This place is thick with Templar troops... Liam and I will make sure he doesn't escape.

Id: [0x0008819D]
{557469}{557469}{557469}Kesegowaase reported Wardrop rooted out tribes from their ancestral lands. He firmly believes that man is behind countless massacres.

Id: [0x0008819E]
My sources in New York confirm that Wardrop has it. I also learned that he is here, at the Congress, under heavy guard.

Id: [0x000881AC]
!*Well now, won't you make a tasty stew.

Id: [0x000881B2]
!*Admit it, I nearly had you!

Id: [0x000881B3]
!*Nearly counts for nothing, Shay. Besides, that was just lucky.

Id: [0x000881B4]
!*I make my own luck, Liam.

Id: [0x000881B5]
!*You've been saying that for years, but you've made precious little. Or have you been spending it all getting out of trouble?

Id: [0x000881B6]
!*You know, trouble just follows me around.

Id: [0x000881B8]

Id: [0x000881BF]
!*You! Do you think that pint of oil will last the night? Go get some more.

Id: [0x000881C0]
!*I'm paying you to move crates, not sit on them. Get moving!

Id: [0x000881C1]
!*That's salt cod, not fine china. [FR]Plus vite, plus vite! [Faster, faster!]

Id: [0x000881C2]
!*We have a long voyage ahead. You, go ready the ship!

Id: [0x000881C8]
!*[FR]ESPECE DE--![What the hell!] Master Cormac!

Id: [0x000881CC]
!*What do you think you are doing?

Id: [0x000881CD]
!*I am training, Captain Joseph.

Id: [0x000881CE]
!*It is [FR]Capitaine Louis-Joseph Gauthier, Chevalier de La Verendrye. And you are dreaming if you think any training could make you into a proper Assassin. Do you even know what that means?

Id: [0x000881D0]
!*It is being responsible for an ancient and proud tradition. It is obeying without question because your Mentor is God himself. How else will we ensure freedom for the human race?

Id: [0x000881D1]
!*Them's pretty words, Chevalier, but I don't feel too free at the moment.

Id: [0x000881D2]
!*Then feel educated.

Id: [0x000881D8]
!*You think you can best your better?

Id: [0x000881D9]
!*Come now, wretch!

Id: [0x000881DA]
!*[FR]Viens, viens! [Come, come!]

Id: [0x000881DB]
!*Is that all you have?

Id: [0x000881DC]
!*I will teach you some manners, boy.

Id: [0x000881E4]
!*Come now, gentlemen. We're on the same side, remember?

Id: [0x000881E5]
!*I would throw you in the brig if we had one! But the Royal Navy has captured some of my allies. Go to the British camp and free them... and get out of my sight!

Id: [0x000881E6]
!*Take these, you'll need them.

Id: [0x000881EC]
!*Don't be so hard on the lad, Chevalier.

Id: [0x000881ED]
!*He is not a lad, he is a man. And an Assassin. What does the mentor sees in him? And why did he let him in.

Id: [0x000881EE]
!*The same reason he let us in: To uphold the tenets of the Creed.

Id: [0x000881EF]
!*I am quite certain our ancient Brothers did not have such a fool in mind!

Id: [0x000881F1]
!*Did you see that floating piece of dung docked off the coast?

Id: [0x000881F2]
!*The craft marred with a black bird? I thought it was wrecked, not docked.

Id: [0x000881F3]
!*One would think! It is a right shame what passes off for a ship in these colonies.

Id: [0x000881F4]
!*A shame it is. But perhaps she'll do some good... as firewood.

Id: [0x000881FA]
!*Thanks. I was saving those fellows for you, in case you were bored.

Id: [0x000881FB]
!*Ah, how thoughtful of you.

Id: [0x000881FD]
!*We owe you our thanks, lad! Those limeys would have hung us for sure.

Id: [0x000881FE]
!*We don't have much coin, but would you be wanting a ship?

Id: [0x00088202]
!*We were towing a salvage, but she's still afloat. The Morrigan, she's called.

Id: [0x00088203]
!*[FR]Morgane... A wicked fairy queen. She is perfect for you, Shay.

Id: [0x00088204]
!*The Morrigan was an old goddess, Queen of War and Darkness. She harvested the souls of fallen warriors. Perfect is right.

Id: [0x00088205]
!*It's an honor, salvage or no. We'll see if we can't put her right.

Id: [0x00088206]
!*Then you have the honor of piloting your "goddess" back home, Shay. I shall join you to supervise the bailing and fire brigade.

Id: [0x00088207]
!*Don't mind him, "Captain Cormac".

Id: [0x00088208]
!*Quite right, "First Mate O’Brien".

Id: [0x0008820E]
!*Some of the men you rescued agreed to join us. They should prove a good crew.

Id: [0x0008820F]
!*She's mine, ain't she? My own ship.

Id: [0x00088210]
!*Your own pile of garbage, yes.

Id: [0x00088211]
!*Ah, with a lick of paint and a few new cannons, she'll look as fine as anything on the seven seas.

Id: [0x00088212]
!*Shall we begin, Captain?

Id: [0x00088213]
!*Indeed, Mate!

Id: [0x00088214]
!*[FR]Connards...[Idiots]

Id: [0x00088216]
!*Slow down to make a tighter turn, Shay.

Id: [0x00088217]
!*The way is narrow. Take in the sail when you turn.

Id: [0x00088218]
!*Train our guns on those icebergs, Shay. Some lead will clear the way right quick!

Id: [0x00088219]
!*Would you look at that, a narwhal! A right sea unicorn that is.

Id: [0x0008821A]
!*Whale! A man could be well set hunting those.

Id: [0x0008821B]
!*Whaling's a tough life, but makes for some wealthy men... and happy wives, I hear.

Id: [0x0008821D]
!*It seems this vessel might be watertight after all. I will return to my ship. It is a long way home, and for once I will enjoy it in peace and quiet. I should have given you your own scow long ago.

Id: [0x0008821E]
!*Sing hearty, lads, Captain Joseph wants some entertainment!

Id: [0x00088224]
Now you think he had something to do with the theft of the artifacts, don't you?

Id: [0x00088225]
I wouldn't put it past him. Haiti's a short voyage from Barbados, and his return to the Colonies certainly coincides with the arrival of the artifacts.

Id: [0x00088226]
!*Liam, what does Achilles mean when he says, "Those Who Came Before"? It almost sounds like part of a prayer.

Id: [0x00088227]
!*I suppose it almost is. "Those Who Came Before", "Precursors", the "First Civilization"... they're ancient people.

Id: [0x00088228]
!*Like from Bible times?

Id: [0x00088229]
!*Even earlier. Achilles says they built the Garden of Eden.

Id: [0x0008822A]
!*Balderdash! God built the Garden of Eden for Adam and Eve.(skeptical) Well, that's what Father Connolly would have use believe.

Id: [0x0008822B]
!*It's... complicated. Imagine if the Apple that Eve ate wasn't a fruit that grew on a tree, but something that looked like an apple... crafted by ancient people. You'd know the good and evil in everyone's heart from it, and you'd be able to control their minds with it.

Id: [0x0008822C]
!*Well that's just idiotic.[beat] How could Eve have eaten a manufactured apple? She'd have broken her teeth on it.

Id: [0x0008822D]
!*Perhaps I'm not wise enough to explain this.

Id: [0x0008822E]
Well, if we've any luck, that ship will lead us right to him.

Id: [0x00088230]
!*Shay, did Achilles tell you any special handling requirements for the Box?

Id: [0x00088231]
!*Same as for powder: Keep it dry and no sudden moves.

Id: [0x00088232]
!*...

Id: [0x00088233]
!*...

Id: [0x00088234]

Id: [0x00088235]
What about the Manuscript?

Id: [0x00088238]
{557624}{557624}{557624}As Master Johnson ordered.

Id: [0x0008823A]
{557626}{557626}{557626}But please do tell Master Washington I will send him my latest invention in a few days.

Id: [0x00088246]
Where to?

Id: [0x00088247]
Wherever Templar affairs lead us.

Id: [0x00088248]
Liam, it's not like you to set out without a plan.

Id: [0x00088249]
Plan or no plan, we choose our own battlefield. And hey, are we not most at ease when we're at sea?

Id: [0x0008824A]
Right you are. Let's set sail.

Id: [0x00088250]
{557648}{557648}{557648}Raise anchor, full sails, double-time, men! The sea may claim us, but not today!

Id: [0x00088257]
Chevalier! What happened to your vessel?

Id: [0x00088258]
I got myself into a bit of a scrape. Sent three ships in all hands to their watery graves, Le Gerfaut nearly followed them down.

Id: [0x0008825A]
I trust your fate has been better, Le Chasseur.

Id: [0x0008825B]
Indeed. My sources informed me that Samuel Smith has searched far and wide, looking for answers on how to make that strange box work. He just returned from Europe.

Id: [0x0008825C]
Where is he now?

Id: [0x0008825E]
Refitting his schooner. If you hurry, you can catch him...[pointing on the map] there.

Id: [0x0008825F]
Oh, remember those blueprints? Well, I had an engineer build that marvelous weapon for your ship. Master Puckle's gun fires more shots than an artillery brigade, and twice as fast.

Id: [0x00088260]
Many thanks!

Id: [0x00088261]
Anything for my hooded friends.

Id: [0x00088266]
{557670}{557670}{557670}May your voyage end in Hell.

Id: [0x0008826D]
[FR][ESPECE DE--!](What the--)Where the hell were you two?

Id: [0x00088278]
{557688}{557688}{557688}We were out training. What happened here?

Id: [0x00088279]
My men were attacked by some English sea dogs!

Id: [0x0008827A]
Why Captain Joseph, couldn't you fight them all off by yourself like you're always saying?

Id: [0x0008827B]
It is [FR][Capitaine](Captain)Louis-Joseph Gauthier, [FR]Chevalier de La Verendrye. And you are dreaming if you think any training could make you into a proper Assassin. Do you even know what that means?

Id: [0x0008827D]
It means being responsible for an ancient and proud tradition. It means obeying your Mentor without question. How else will we ensure freedom for the human race?

Id: [0x0008827E]
Them's pretty words, Chevalier, but I don't feel too free at the moment.

Id: [0x0008827F]
Well then feel educated, urgh!

Id: [0x00088283]
Take these, you'll need them.

Id: [0x00088289]
Maybe you are not completely useless, Shay.

Id: [0x0008828A]
Speaking of useless, those blockheads won't be needing this vessel anymore.

Id: [0x0008828B]
This pile of [FR][merde?](Shit?)

Id: [0x0008829A]
!*So what's a lady like you doing in a respectable place like this?

Id: [0x0008829B]
!*Praying for your misguided soul.

Id: [0x0008829C]
!*Oh, you need not waste your time. The Devil's already spoken for it.

Id: [0x0008829D]
!*It is good to see you Shay. But this is not a social call, is it?

Id: [0x0008829E]
!*I need to find Benjamin Franklin.

Id: [0x0008829F]
!*He's in Philadelphia. No, wait, I did hear something about him coming to New York. My man Hendrick van Slyke could tell you, but he has gotten himself into a bit of trouble.

Id: [0x000882A0]
!*What sort of trouble?

Id: [0x000882A1]
!*He is being held captive. We are friends with the man in authority, General Howe, but his hands are tied.

Id: [0x000882A2]
!*Free Hendrick, say hello to Howe. I could do that... but I need better gear if I'm to walk into a military camp.

Id: [0x000882A3]
!*Well, there is a shop just around the corner.

Id: [0x000882B2]
!*Hey there! You in the hood!

Id: [0x000882B4]
!*Did Hope send you? Quick, break the lock and get me out of here!

Id: [0x000882B6]
!*Thank you! We must leave before the guards catch us.

Id: [0x000882B7]
!*Follow my lead.

Id: [0x000882B8]
!*I will...

Id: [0x000882B9]
!*I'm Shay. Just keep up.

Id: [0x000882BB]
!*So, I hear you know a man named Franklin.

Id: [0x000882BC]
!*Oh yes, the inventor. Someone is courting him to develop weapons.

Id: [0x000882BD]
!*Is he any good at that, building weapons?

Id: [0x000882BE]
!*It's not his cup of tea, but I suppose he could. If you want to meet him, you should do him a favor. He is a busy man and will not be interrupted by just anyone.

Id: [0x000882BF]
!*I'll keep that in mind.

Id: [0x000882C3]
!*Enough sport, I must get back to business. Thank you for your help, Shay.

Id: [0x000882C4]
!*My lady.

Id: [0x000882CC]
!*General.

Id: [0x000882CD]
!*What?

Id: [0x000882CE]
!*Ah. I suppose none of you Assassins knock.

Id: [0x000882CF]
!*Just a bad habit. Didn't think I would find a friendly face here.

Id: [0x000882D0]
!*The Templars are spreading throughout His Majesty's army, deciding our strategies at the highest levels. I want to restore our dignity and get them out of this institution.

Id: [0x000882D1]
!*An officer I can respect? Will wonders never cease.

Id: [0x000882D2]
!*I am sure you are not here just to malign my colleagues.

Id: [0x000882D3]
!*I need to find a man. Benjamin Franklin.

Id: [0x000882D4]
!*Indeed. One of those puppet masters has requested his aid... A man will be leaving this camp soon to deliver a small package to his laboratory. Follow him and you will find Franklin.

Id: [0x000882D5]
!*Thank you, and good luck rooting out the Templars.

Id: [0x000882D6]
!*Good luck to you, Assassin.

Id: [0x000882DB]
!*Well this is a bit of trouble. Which one is heading to see Franklin? I had best follow both.

Id: [0x000882E0]
!*Good, that other fellow must be off to Franklin's laboratory. Better be quick and catch him.

Id: [0x000882E7]
!*Who are you?

Id: [0x000882E8]
!*Shay, sir. Here is the--

Id: [0x000882E9]
!*Ah! The copper foil for my Leyden jar! Please give my thanks to Master Washington.

Id: [0x000882EA]
!*Of course, sir... Anything else?

Id: [0x000882EB]
!*Perhaps you could relay a message for me?[beat, quickly] You see, electrical fire is the key! If I am correct I will be able to give that curious device the spark of life.

Id: [0x000882EC]
!*You have the box, sir?

Id: [0x000882ED]
!*Of course not! I returned it along with the manuscript.[realizing he may have said too much] Forget I said anything. My research will take months to complete...

Id: [0x000882EE]
!*But please do tell Master Washington I will send him my latest invention in a few days.

Id: [0x000882EF]
!*Master Franklin.

Id: [0x000882F3]
!*I suppose this new invention was commissioned by the Templars.(sarcastically) It would be a shame for it to fall into Assassin hands...

Id: [0x000882F6]
The Templars desire to understand the nature of these artifacts. Their spies have called on many doctors and other learned people in New York.

Id: [0x000882FA]
We learned that Lawrence Washington sent out the Manuscript.

Id: [0x000882FB]
Lawrence Washington... Businessman, Virginian politician, and high-ranking Templar.

Id: [0x000882FC]
Ah yes, I recently heard he was back from the West Indies. One of my men saw his majordomo pick up a strange package.

Id: [0x000882FD]
Then that package will be delivered to him promptly. Shay, figure out what it is and find Washington. And when you do... learn all you can.

Id: [0x00088300]
You want her, Shay, she is yours. Now bring me back to my ship.

Id: [0x00088307]
You there!

Id: [0x00088311]
Gentlemen.

Id: [0x00088313]
[Coughs][beat]My brother is a bright spot in a troubled land. If I may make one request before I depart this life, please leave him in peace. He should have nothing to do with the troubles of the Templar cause.

Id: [0x00088314]
We all respect that sentiment, sir.

Id: [0x00088316]
You have my thanks, gentlemen. Master Smith, are you ready to leave on your voyage?

Id: [0x00088317]
Aye sir! I shall return with answers.

Id: [0x00088318]
Master Wardrop, are you likewise engaged with the manuscript?

Id: [0x00088319]
Yes, sir. We will soon know its meaning.

Id: [0x0008831A]
Then I bid you take your leave.[beat][coughs]

Id: [0x00088327]
So, what's our next heading?

Id: [0x00088328]
Wherever this Lawrence Washington docks his arse.

Id: [0x00088329]
Liam, you're finally getting into the spirit of things!

Id: [0x0008832B]
I'll prepare the Morrigan.

Id: [0x00088332]
!*What do we do now?

Id: [0x00088333]
!*Find out where this Lawrence Washington sleeps.

Id: [0x00088334]
!*Yes, let's give him a nice wake-up call.

Id: [0x00088336]
!*So, this Franklin fellow, what can you tell me about him?

Id: [0x00088337]
!*Not much, I'm afraid. All I know of him I learned from Hope.

Id: [0x00088338]
!*Of course you did.

Id: [0x00088339]
!*He's an inventor. A queer fellow but very intelligent, she said. If anyone could figure out those strange diagrams, it would be him.

Id: [0x0008833A]
!*What manner of things does he invent?

Id: [0x0008833B]
!*Oh, scientific instruments, tools for printers, geegaws like that. He is working with electrical fire now.

Id: [0x0008833C]
!*You mean like lightning?

Id: [0x0008833D]
!*Aye. Word is he's trying to trap lightning in a jar, to use it again later.

Id: [0x0008833E]
!*Use it for what?

Id: [0x0008833F]
!*Who knows?

Id: [0x00088341]
!*Hope's been spending a lot of time in New York lately. I barely see her anymore.

Id: [0x00088342]
!*Achilles has her on a long term assignment there. She's making "connections" between various factions.

Id: [0x00088343]
!*How do you mean?

Id: [0x00088344]
!*There is a certain, how shall I say this, "criminal" element in New York.

Id: [0x00088345]
!*Oh, I'm sure. Like in Dublin.

Id: [0x00088346]
!*Yes, well, some of these factions are getting organized. There's over ten thousand people living there now. More arriving every year.

Id: [0x00088347]
!*And when there's so many sheep to fleece, the criminals need to get organized.

Id: [0x00088348]
!*Hope says they're divided into three main groups. Muscle for hire, thieves and burglars, and ladies of the night.

Id: [0x00088349]
!*Hope's awful lady-like to be associated with that sort.

Id: [0x0008834A]
!*She has a job to do.

Id: [0x00088351]
I'm a devoted housekeeper.

Id: [0x00088353]
Look to those wounds, young man.

Id: [0x00088354]
[FR][Oh Merde! Où sont ces crétins?](Shit! Where are those idiots?)

Id: [0x00088355]
Hold it together men! We will find a way off this island.

Id: [0x000883BD]
Trust me, you will sell those lobsters by the ton in France.

Id: [0x000883BF]
[Falling to Sleep]Stay... where... you... are-

Id: [0x000883C7]
Assassins! Stop him! Stop Shay!

Id: [0x000883D9]
At your service, as always.

Id: [0x000883E3]
This won't be my first visit to that wretched isle. De La Verendrye often roosts there.

Id: [0x000883E4]
It is a well-defended rock.

Id: [0x000883E5]
If it's as last I saw it, only a fool or a madman would sail into its maw.

Id: [0x000883E6]
A fool or a madman? There's no shame in either.

Id: [0x000883E7]
All the same, I'll think more of our prospects if we're able to find a less conspicuous entrance.

Id: [0x000883E8]
Still thinking like an Assassin, eh captain?

Id: [0x000883E9]
At least one of us ought to think, dear Gist.

Id: [0x000883EA]
Aye, sir.

Id: [0x000883ED]
Blizzard, Captain! The winds could push us straight into those icebergs.

Id: [0x000883F1]
It appears they have not dispersed their ships, Captain.

Id: [0x000883F2]
There may be an alternate route to the west.

Id: [0x000883F3]
Ah, to hell with it! I've spent enough time crawling in the shadows!

Id: [0x000883F4]
Yes, sir!

Id: [0x000883F5]
Ready for battle!

Id: [0x000883FA]
Anticosti is famed for its shipwrecks. They likely believe no one would venture into such dangerous waters.

Id: [0x000883FB]
None but fools and madmen, perhaps? Watch out for those icebergs, Captain.

Id: [0x00088402]
Ugh....

Id: [0x00088404]
{558084}{558084}{558084}I was shot.... (angered)Liam?

Id: [0x00088405]
{558085}{558085}{558085}Whose home is this? How did I get here?

Id: [0x0008840A]
{558090}{558090}{558090}High water coming! Brace yourself!

Id: [0x00088424]
{558116}{558116}{558116}These documents are nothing but blasted symbols and nonsense.

Id: [0x00088425]
{558117}{558117}{558117}That French devil was always one for secrets. But he has found the site of a great treasure. I am sure of it.

Id: [0x0008842A]
Then we know where de la Verendrye's ships are headed?

Id: [0x0008842B]
Not quite. But we have the means to find out. We'll need Cook to interpret these maps.

Id: [0x0008842C]
Then we should set sail for the coast of Newfoundland.

Id: [0x00088430]
That was a far closer escape than I'm comfortable with, but we have what we came for.

Id: [0x00088432]
{558130}{558130}{558130}Where the devil did she come from? A stray from the blockade?

Id: [0x00088434]
You'd better borrow some coin. Bartering with an empty purse won't get you very far.

Id: [0x00088436]
The sea between here and Anticosti is rough, Captain, but the Morrigan seems sturdy enough for the challenge.

Id: [0x00088439]
I have my eye on you, boy.

Id: [0x0008843A]
Come on! Captain de la Verendrye and his crew must have run into some trouble.

Id: [0x0008843B]
Who knew meeting with smugglers would lead to no good?

Id: [0x0008843D]
Tread with care, Shay. The Royal Navy will be ready for us. Remember your training.

Id: [0x00088442]
{558146}{558146}{558146}Got him! Bilge rat thought he could get away.

Id: [0x00088445]
Keep an eye out, lads. Their pals are still out there somewhere.

Id: [0x00088447]
Not bad.

Id: [0x00088449]
There he goes again.

Id: [0x0008844B]
{558155}{558155}{558155}Poor sods.

Id: [0x0008844D]
{558157}{558157}{558157}Liam! Are you there?

Id: [0x00088450]
{558160}{558160}{558160}British ships! We'll never make it.

Id: [0x00088451]
{558161}{558161}{558161}We're assassins, Shay. We always make it.

Id: [0x0008845A]
{558170}{558170}{558170}So Barry, why did those fellows try to harm you this morning?

Id: [0x0008845B]
{558171}{558171}{558171}Oh, just some nonsense from ne'er-do-wells. My wife and I want to start up a little business, but some locals want a cut before we even get going!

Id: [0x0008845C]
{558172}{558172}{558172}That's not even sporting. I'll go see if I can talk some sense into them.

Id: [0x0008845D]
{558173}{558173}{558173}We don't want you getting into any trouble! But if you insist on it, I'll tell you where to find the jackal's den.

Id: [0x00088465]
{558181}{558181}{558181}So what's your problem, messing with good folks like the Finnegans?

Id: [0x00088466]
We own this town, boy.

Id: [0x00088467]
Stay out of our business.

Id: [0x0008846D]
Be at ease, Master Cormac, we are friends. The Finnegans were worried you might take matters into your own hands. I am Colonel George Monro.

Id: [0x0008846E]
Colonel.

Id: [0x0008846F]
I came to help, but I see I am late. Thank you for dealing with these foul criminals. They were a blight on New York.

Id: [0x00088470]
{558192}{558192}{558192}You're welcome.

Id: [0x00088471]
{558193}{558193}{558193}Come with me, Master Cormac.

Id: [0x00088475]
Master Cormac. I am sorry to bother you when you are barely out of your sickbed.

Id: [0x00088476]
{558198}{558198}{558198}What kind of trouble?

Id: [0x00088477]
Look at these. Bullets as loud and bright as firecrackers.

Id: [0x00088478]
{558200}{558200}{558200}And you're not going because...?

Id: [0x00088479]
{558201}{558201}{558201}My red coat is rather conspicuous, don't you think?

Id: [0x0008847A]
{558202}{558202}{558202}You have a point, Colonel.

Id: [0x00088482]
{558210}{558210}{558210}Thank you, my good fellow! I must say that cravat was rather uncomfortable.

Id: [0x00088483]
{558211}{558211}{558211}Christopher Gist? I'm Shay Cormac. The Colonel sent me.

Id: [0x00088484]
{558212}{558212}{558212}Monro? Well, I've always said he has excellent taste in friends. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Shay.

Id: [0x00088485]
Well, I was looking for a new place to live...

Id: [0x00088486]
{558214}{558214}{558214}Well, some associates and I have a trading company. A few weeks ago we were robbed. When I heard that our merchandise was being traded up and down the river on an abandoned vessel, well, I just had to see for myself! I'd barely boarded the Morrigan when I found myself grossly outnumbered.

Id: [0x00088487]
{558215}{558215}{558215}Abandoned! The Morrigan is my ship, Gist. I know her from stem to stern.

Id: [0x00088488]
Wait. I can hardly let you do that alone.

Id: [0x0008848A]
We'll give you a lesson!

Id: [0x000884AF]
{558255}{558255}{558255}I see.

Id: [0x000884B0]
Master Gist, did you learn more about our conspirators and their new weapons?

Id: [0x000884B1]
{558257}{558257}{558257}Excellent.

Id: [0x000884B2]
{558258}{558258}{558258}Did you find out more about that new weapon, Gist?

Id: [0x000884B3]
Only that their base of operations is a French fort further down the river.

Id: [0x000884B4]
{558260}{558260}{558260}Why do I think this will be complicated?

Id: [0x000884B5]
{558261}{558261}{558261}Not at all! We just have to infiltrate a French fort... They ended up with the goods.

Id: [0x000884B6]
If the French have installed a fort in our territory, they are likely preparing an assault. New York could burn.

Id: [0x000884D0]
{558288}{558288}{558288}What?! He's dead! Get help!

Id: [0x000884D2]
{558290}{558290}{558290}There it is. Anticosti.

Id: [0x000884D3]
{558291}{558291}{558291}Are you sure? There's a fleet to rival Liverpool's docks.

Id: [0x000884D4]
{558292}{558292}{558292}We prefer to... discourage unwanted visitors.

Id: [0x000884DB]
{558299}{558299}{558299}Well, Shay, today you're a captain and a fully fledged assassin. How does it feel?

Id: [0x000884DC]
{558300}{558300}{558300}Like I'm just getting started.]

Id: [0x000884E0]
{558304}{558304}{558304}I gather you have some history with our friend De La Verendrye.

Id: [0x000884E1]
{558305}{558305}{558305}A history of instant loathing. I should have known not to trust the Brotherhood when it embraced such a retch.

Id: [0x000884E2]
{558306}{558306}{558306}It takes a rotten soul and a wild mind to adopt chaos as a way of life. Theirs is a child's view of the world. And they would let that world succumb to flames for the sake of a tantrum.

Id: [0x000884E3]
{558307}{558307}{558307}I've met many I could call friends. Men and women that have been led down the wrong path. But Joseph is just a cantankerous bastard.

Id: [0x000884E4]
{558308}{558308}{558308}I've heard tell of his legendary charm.

Id: [0x000884E5]
{558309}{558309}{558309}But what of the others? What of your former first mate, Mr. O'Brien?

Id: [0x000884E6]
{558310}{558310}{558310}What of him?

Id: [0x000884E7]
{558311}{558311}{558311}Do you have the stomach to do what must be done? Will his blood rest as easily on your blade?

Id: [0x000884E8]
{558312}{558312}{558312}I've witnessed the consequences of their deeds, Haytham. Do not doubt me for a moment.

Id: [0x000884E9]
{558313}{558313}{558313}Then we shall speak of it no more.

Id: [0x000884EC]
Ship ahoy!

Id: [0x000884ED]
A fleet, captain. We've found them.

Id: [0x000884EE]
Let us hope we are not too late. They have us at a serious disadvantage.

Id: [0x000884EF]
We're gaining on them. The Morrigan won't let us down.

Id: [0x000884F1]
This snow has been sent to bedevil us.

Id: [0x000884F2]
It won't slow us down for long. And perhaps it will help us to take them by surprise.

Id: [0x000884F3]
Brace!

Id: [0x000884F4]
It's an ambush!

Id: [0x000884F5]
Steady the ship!

Id: [0x000884F8]
Where are they?!

Id: [0x000884F9]
They're within mortar range. That's all I know.

Id: [0x000884FB]
It's the Gerfaut!

Id: [0x000884FC]
{558332}{558332}{558332}Joseph!

Id: [0x000884FD]
Irksome to the last. De la Verendrye must have stayed behind to stop us.

Id: [0x000884FE]
And no doubt volunteered for the job.

Id: [0x00088502]
Don't sink her! We still need de La Verendrye's charts!

Id: [0x00088507]
She's dead in the water! Prepare for boarding!

Id: [0x0008850B]
{558347}{558347}{558347}You empty headed animal food trough wiper!

Id: [0x0008850C]
{558348}{558348}{558348}I fart in your general direction!

Id: [0x0008850D]
{558349}{558349}{558349}Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!

Id: [0x0008850E]
{558350}{558350}{558350}I blow my nose at you!

Id: [0x0008850F]
{558351}{558351}{558351}Go and boil your bottom!

Id: [0x00088570]
!*It's good to see you're feeling better, Shay.

Id: [0x00088571]
!*Thank you... I'm sorry, I haven't been myself lately. Who are you?

Id: [0x00088572]
!*Sweet Mother Mary, have we taken in the village idiot?

Id: [0x00088573]
!*Now be kind, Barry, the lad's been feverish for days.

Id: [0x00088574]
!*Shay, I'm Cassidy Finnegan and this dunderhead is my husband Barry. A friend of ours found you half-drowned and brought you here!

Id: [0x00088575]
!*Thank you. I hate to have been a burden.

Id: [0x00088576]
!*See, he's a civilized fellow.

Id: [0x00088577]
!*For a clumsy deckhand. Probably fell off his ship half-drunk.

Id: [0x00088578]
!*BARRY!

Id: [0x00088579]
!*No, Mrs. Finnegan, he's likely right. I have been in that state far too often.

Id: [0x0008857A]
!*I'm sure you're wrong, sweetheart. And you can call me Casey.

Id: [0x0008857B]
!*And you can call her Casey.

Id: [0x0008857C]
!*Barry, don't you be insinuating no nonsense!

Id: [0x0008857D]
!*I ain't insinuating nothing! You're chatting up a fellow a tenth of your age. Why don't you offer him a teat while you're at it?

Id: [0x0008857E]
!*Perhaps I should back to bed, I feel a dizzy spell coming on.

Id: [0x0008857F]
!*Wait right there, I've something for you.

Id: [0x00088580]
What's going on?

Id: [0x0008858F]
Why were these men bothering you?

Id: [0x00088591]
{558481}{558481}{558481}Let's take you home to the boss.

Id: [0x00088592]
My friends will want to meet you.

Id: [0x00088593]
{558483}{558483}{558483}Stay a while!

Id: [0x00088594]
{558484}{558484}{558484}Don't be leaving.

Id: [0x00088595]
You picked the wrong side!

Id: [0x00088596]
Putting your nose in other people's business ain't nice!

Id: [0x0008859E]
Now, let us use some of that money for the good of the city.

Id: [0x000885A0]
Mere survival is not enough. Full bellies, warm clothing... Freedom from want is the greatest freedom of all.

Id: [0x000885A2]
See this neglected edifice, Master Cormac? We can make it better.

Id: [0x000885A3]
{558499}{558499}{558499}I like the sound of that.

Id: [0x000885A7]
Urban renewal is a new science, but one that has already proven effective on the Continent. I have arranged for resources, use them to improve that building.

Id: [0x000885AC]
His name is Christopher Gist, and he might be in over his head. I fear these brutes will hang him like a dog.

Id: [0x000885AE]
{558510}{558510}{558510}I did not wish to alarm the Finnegans, but you are made of sterner stuff. I have heard these brutes mean to hang Master Gist like a dog.

Id: [0x000885B1]
I will not let those outlaws have another victim.

Id: [0x000885B3]
Good. The villains are entrenched at old Fort Arsenal. I have urgent business in Albany. Please tell Master Gist to join me there.

Id: [0x000885BD]
This bastard nicked what we rightfully stole! Let's say we give him a stretch!

Id: [0x000885BE]
Go to Hell, the lot of you!

Id: [0x000885C3]
Good show, Shay! Ran them right out of their own den!

Id: [0x000885C4]
Well don't put your name on the door yet! There may be a few men left on their ship.

Id: [0x000885C5]
The Morrigan! What is she doing there?

Id: [0x000885C6]
Help me if you can then.

Id: [0x000885C7]
{558535}{558535}{558535}Then let us retrieve your Lady Morrigan.

Id: [0x000885C9]
Keep your wits about you, Shay. Criminals are everywhere, and most of them look just like law-abiding citizens.

Id: [0x000885D3]
{558547}{558547}{558547}I've come back to you, lass.

Id: [0x000885D4]
She's a fine ship. And true to my word, I've found a crew for her. I did leave one position unfilled, though. Tell me, Shay, do you have a first mate?

Id: [0x000885D5]
{558549}{558549}{558549}Thank you Gist, you're a good man.

Id: [0x000885D6]
{558550}{558550}{558550}I did leave one position unfilled, though. Tell me, Shay, did you have a mate?

Id: [0x000885D7]
He's... long gone.

Id: [0x000885D8]
Then I apply for the post, Captain!

Id: [0x000885D9]
Welcome aboard.

Id: [0x000885E3]
{558563}{558563}{558563}So, Captain, does the crew meet your standards?

Id: [0x000885E4]
{558564}{558564}{558564}Meets and exceeds.

Id: [0x000885E5]
{558565}{558565}{558565}Then may I suggest our next destination? The Colonel will be expecting me to report back.

Id: [0x000885E6]
{558566}{558566}{558566}My thoughts exactly. Colonel Monro said he would be in Albany.

Id: [0x000885E7]
Splendid![to the crew] Full sail ahead, lads!

Id: [0x000885E9]
{558569}{558569}{558569}Colonel on deck!

Id: [0x000885EA]
In good health, I see?

Id: [0x000885EB]
Ehh thanks to the Captain, here.

Id: [0x000885ED]
'Tis a fine vessel, Captain Cormac.

Id: [0x000885EE]
Thank you, Colonel Monro.

Id: [0x000885EF]
It's a little close for comfort, isn't it?

Id: [0x000885F0]
Might I suggest we improve our vessel?  The Morrigan is good, but with a few more supplies she could be unstoppable. And there's a French outpost nearby I happen to know...

Id: [0x000885F1]
I like the sound of that.

Id: [0x000885FE]
There he is!

Id: [0x000885FF]
Most fortunate timing. Lady Luck never ceases to smile on you.

Id: [0x00088600]
He's seen us. Give chase!

Id: [0x00088601]
{558593}{558593}{558593}A new Templar device, no doubt.

Id: [0x00088603]
What wickedness is this?

Id: [0x00088604]
Another Templar tactic. They can cover whole stretches of ocean with their flames.

Id: [0x00088605]
Careful, Shay. We could be burnt to cinders.

Id: [0x00088607]
{558599}{558599}{558599}Smith is cutting through the ice!

Id: [0x00088608]
{558600}{558600}{558600}He's as crazy as you are, Captain.

Id: [0x00088609]
{558601}{558601}{558601}I sincerely doubt that.

Id: [0x0008860A]
{558602}{558602}{558602}We almost have him!

Id: [0x0008860B]
{558603}{558603}{558603}Don't let up, Shay!

Id: [0x0008860E]
{558606}{558606}{558606}It seems their Templar equipment is far from perfect. That vessel is damaged and losing speed.

Id: [0x0008860F]
{558607}{558607}{558607}Now's our chance to catch Smith!

Id: [0x00088611]
{558609}{558609}{558609}Brace!

Id: [0x00088612]
{558610}{558610}{558610}We're being boarded!

Id: [0x00088613]
[FR][Envoyez ces diables en enfer!](Send these devils to hell!) Smith must not escape!

Id: [0x00088614]
There's Smith! He's moving again!

Id: [0x00088615]
I'm glad to disappoint him. And he's still within reach.

Id: [0x00088616]
I've heard they steal from civilians and resell essential goods for ten times the price.

Id: [0x00088617]
The outpost is not far now.

Id: [0x00088618]
What sort of business are the French up to there? Just occupying the territory?

Id: [0x00088619]
It is an economic incursion more than a geographical one. Some of the ruffians are sponsored by enemies of the colonies. They intend to undermine local authorities.

Id: [0x0008861A]
It's always the little fellow who gets skinned.

Id: [0x00088627]
Good show, Shay! Now let's use those materials to give the Morrigan more firepower.

Id: [0x00088629]
Splendid! That fort and her defenders will tremble before the Morrigan!

Id: [0x00088633]
There's our target, Shay! Knock her down like a game of nine pins.

Id: [0x00088634]
Begin by hitting her towers.

Id: [0x00088636]
Superb! Now find the fort commander!

Id: [0x0008863F]
Le Chasseur...

Id: [0x00088640]
Shay! It has been so long. Were you on a special mission?

Id: [0x00088641]
Yes, from Achilles.

Id: [0x00088642]
How interesting!

Id: [0x00088643]
So am I.

Id: [0x00088645]
You were always good at your business, Shay.

Id: [0x00088646]
As were you. Tell me, what are you doing inland?

Id: [0x00088647]
Special weapons... Poisonous gases to use against colonial authorities. I am merely a delivery man.

Id: [0x00088648]
Then may your final delivery be swift.

It is terribly dusty here. I'm sure Shay can recount his adventures to us over a pint. Hey the first round’s on huh the Colonel!

Id: [0x0008865E]
{558686}{558686}{558686}Ah, Master Cormac. It seems you have frightened the local lawbreakers. They are changing tactics.

Id: [0x0008865F]
What's their plan now?

Id: [0x00088660]
Their boss has hired Benjamin Franklin to produce new weapons for them. He's very well-guarded.

Id: [0x00088661]
Benjamin Franklin... The scientist?

Id: [0x00088662]
You have heard of him, good. He is making equipment to spread gases among the populace. Toxic ones, as it turns out.

Id: [0x00088663]
The populace? I thought they would use it against the authorities.

Id: [0x00088664]
Though that would be terrible as well...

Id: [0x00088665]
The ruffians we have arrested refer to an intimidating woman. I believe she is behind these nefarious plans.

Id: [0x00088666]
I'll look into this.

Id: [0x00088667]
{558695}{558695}{558695}Good. I trust you will do what you have to.

Id: [0x00088669]
Hope... I pray it's not you.

Id: [0x0008866D]
Shay? It is good to see you again! Your friend Hope said you were away.

Id: [0x0008866E]
I... was.

Id: [0x0008866F]
Sir, I-- I've come to collect the results of your experiments.

Id: [0x00088670]
Oh, well... it's a very good thing then I just finished fixing the prototype. Here you go!

Id: [0x00088672]
{558706}{558706}{558706}Thank you. It's very impressive.

Id: [0x00088673]
I was preparing to leave for Philadelphia, and then Europe. I was invited to lecture in London.[beat] Oh! Would you be so kind as to inform Mistress Hope?

Id: [0x00088674]
Of course.

Id: [0x00088675]
{558709}{558709}{558709}I'll do that. Goodbye, my friend.

Id: [0x00088676]
{558710}{558710}{558710}Oh God, Hope... What are you doing with these felons? Turning the city against itself? What have you become?

Id: [0x0008867B]
{558715}{558715}{558715}Is something the matter, Master Cormac?

Id: [0x0008867C]
{558716}{558716}{558716}No, yes, just... old memories.

Id: [0x0008867D]
{558717}{558717}{558717}When I am issued new recruits burdened with regrets, I tell them the surest way to lose them is with gunpowder.

Id: [0x0008867E]
{558718}{558718}{558718}You're right, Colonel.

Id: [0x00088681]
Good work. I think you are ready to turn this new weapon against the ruffians who would have used it.

Id: [0x00088682]
{558722}{558722}{558722}Agreed. Where should I start?

Id: [0x00088683]
There is an abandoned factory nearby, hiding a dangerous poison. Right now, it only causes sleep... But I fear those outlaws are distilling it. A more powerful formula could sicken or perhaps even kill most of New York.

Id: [0x00088685]
Then that's my first target.

Id: [0x00088686]
Be careful, Master Cormac. We understand that the ingredients are... highly unstable.

Id: [0x00088687]
All the better.

Id: [0x0008868C]
Stop this you fool!

Id: [0x00088690]
From the Colonel...

Id: [0x00088697]
{558743}{558743}{558743}Dear Master Cormac, I leave for Fort William Henry, an ill-prepared garrison surrounded by hostile natives and the French Army. We have requested reinforcements but I doubt they will be forthcoming. I have no illusions that our resistance will be successful.

Id: [0x00088699]
{558745}{558745}{558745}Sorry for the early libation, Captain. But do you realize it has been a year since we met? A whole year! Change my life, you did... And for the better![laughs] You will forgive me if I have been, er, celebrating without you.

Id: [0x0008869A]
{558746}{558746}{558746}The celebration will have to wait, my friend. I fear the Colonel might be in trouble.

Id: [0x0008869B]
How do you mean in trouble?

Id: [0x0008869C]
He's at Fort William Henry, facing impossible odds.

Id: [0x0008869E]
Get off your lazy arses, lads! And man your stations! We raise anchor!

Id: [0x000886A4]
Ahh. What marvelous destruction, Captain! I saw the smoke all the way from the Morrigan!

Id: [0x000886A5]
That should discourage those miscreants. New York is safe, for now.

Id: [0x000886A6]
With all due respect, Colonel, it's going to take more than a few explosions to get rid of this kind of trouble.

Id: [0x000886A8]
The boy is right, Colonel Monro.

Id: [0x000886AA]
{558762}{558762}{558762}Cut this fellow some slack, Johnson.

Id: [0x000886AB]
Shay, was it? Congratulations. You just burned a whole lot of rats out of New York. I'm Jack Weeks, this is William Johnson. I don't know about him, but I'm pleased to meet you.

Id: [0x000886AC]
Pleased to meet you as well.

Id: [0x000886AE]
Is something the matter, Master Cormac?

Id: [0x000886AF]
Just a little confused... I must have breathed some of that gas.

Id: [0x000886B0]
Some ale will do you good. Come, we are all friends here, you will be taken care of.

Id: [0x000886B8]
Shay! You are a sight for sore eyes!

Id: [0x000886B9]
Jack?

Id: [0x000886BA]
Colonel Monro surrendered to General Montcalm. The French and their Abenaki allies took Fort Henry.[bitter, more to himself] Johnson was supposed to bring reinforcements here...

Id: [0x000886BB]
The Abenaki are restless. They don't understand the terms of surrender and refuse to heed Montcalm. The Colonel and his men were released this morning. They're walking into an ambush...

Id: [0x000886BC]
Wait here in case Johnson arrives. I'll-- I'll protect the Colonel.

Id: [0x000886BD]
I don't see anyone else.

Id: [0x000886BF]
Thank you!

Id: [0x000886C0]
Maybe I can finally repay my debt to him.

Id: [0x000886CB]
Keep together, men!

Id: [0x000886CC]
Master Cormac, I am afraid we cannot return fire.

Id: [0x000886CD]
I'll take out as many as I can.

Id: [0x000886CF]
You live!?

Id: [0x000886D1]
Take cover!

Id: [0x000886EF]
It's nothing more than a last desperate throw of the dice. He knows we have him.

Id: [0x000886F0]
What are you waiting for? Finish him now!

Id: [0x000886F1]
Think about what you're doing, Assassin! Your Brotherhood is using you!

It was a risk, but I suspected you might have left your brothers behind.

Id: [0x00088790]
{558992}{558992}{558992}He is rallying men to storm Albany. I've learned that his allies threaten a friendly Iroquois village, and French troops are already on their way.

I was stopping to restock my ship when I heard the talented Captain Cook was here. Could we have a word?

Id: [0x0008881A]
I'm looking for a man. Captain Louis-Joseph Gauthier, Chevalier de la Verendrye.

Id: [0x0008881B]
The explorer. I have heard of him, and his illustrious family.

Id: [0x0008881C]
I must see him.

Id: [0x0008881D]
Ah, send him my regards![seeing the look on SHAY's face, clearing his throat] Or not... He sailed east a few days ago on a heading to Anticosti.

Id: [0x0008881E]
{559134}{559134}{559134}Do you know where he is?

Id: [0x0008881F]
{559135}{559135}{559135}No. But Le Gerfaut sailed east a few days ago.

Id: [0x00088820]
Hmm... Indeed.

Id: [0x00088821]
I would advise caution.

Id: [0x00088822]
Oh, I've been there before.

Id: [0x00088823]
Then I bid you good fortune.[beat] I will be sailing past Conception Bay, should you require further assistance.

Id: [0x00088824]
Much obliged.

Id: [0x0008883A]
I doubt even these breeches will get me into the King's chambers. Besides, I'm only here to see a business acquaintance.

Id: [0x00088843]
I suspect New York will prosper under your watch, Master Cormac.

Id: [0x00088844]
If we might have a moment alone...

Id: [0x00088846]
So what do you think of the crew, Christopher?

Id: [0x00088847]
Call me Gist, lad. Christopher was my father's name.

Id: [0x00088848]
Wasn't Gist your father's name too?

Id: [0x00088849]
Well, that's a matter of opinion...

Id: [0x0008884E]
{559182}{559182}{559182}Mistress Hope also asked for some special grenades she could fill with various gases. Clever girl, that! You'll find some in the lab.

Id: [0x00088851]
{559185}{559185}{559185}I am sorry to trouble you when you are barely out of your sickbed.

Id: [0x00088852]
{559186}{559186}{559186}It's hardly trouble. I've had enough of being cooped up.[beat] So, why are you worried about your friend?

Id: [0x00088853]
{559187}{559187}{559187}I can imagine.

Id: [0x00088854]
{559188}{559188}{559188}So, why are you worried about your friend?

Id: [0x00088856]
Such a shame.[beat] So we cannot know if he found the site.

Id: [0x00088857]
Indeed. But if there was a temple under the waves, I doubt it is still standing.

Id: [0x00088859]
Master Cormac! I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

Id: [0x0008885A]
I found de la Verendrye's travel plans, but the devil used some kind of code. I-- I can't figure it out. Maybe you'll have better luck?

Id: [0x0008885E]
How strange... It is a very old cipher. I have seen it once before. I could draw you a map...

Id: [0x00088863]
!*My people call me Onatah. All my life, I have lived here. Our ancestors claimed these lands long ago. Let me tell you a story, Shay.

Id: [0x00088865]
!*Please do, venerable one.

Id: [0x00088866]
!*Out in the forest, all by themselves, lived an old man and an old woman. One day they heard a noise. It was the sound of knocking, like the sound a birchbark drum makes. The sound came from below the ground.

Id: [0x00088872]
!*What? From a cellar?

Id: [0x00088873]
!*What was it?

Id: [0x00088874]
!*Patience, boy. The old couple dug at the ground and found a small child. He had come to them from the World Beneath the Earth.

Id: [0x00088875]
!*Perhaps you are not ready for this story. Not everyone can understand.

Id: [0x00088876]
!*Of course I can understand.

Id: [0x00088878]
!*What color is the sky?

Id: [0x00088879]
!*Um, blue?

Id: [0x0008887A]
!*You are not ready. Come back later when you have learned to see and listen.

Id: [0x0008887B]
I don't mean to question you, Captain, but Anticosti's not the safest place, is it?

Id: [0x00088880]
These documents are nothing but blasted symbols and nonsense.

Id: [0x00088881]
That French devil was always one for secrets. But he has found the site of a great treasure. I am sure of it.

Id: [0x0008889D]
Or you could accompany me. Help me find de la Verendrye.

Id: [0x0008889E]
An urgent matter then. Very well. We shall sail together again.

Id: [0x000888AE]
Ah, Shay. You certainly look prepared to meet royalty! Perhaps King Louis himself will grant you an audience.

Id: [0x000888AF]
Yes, I heard a group of merchants would be here today. They might come see my scientific demonstration later!

Id: [0x000888B0]
They really should, they might learn something.[beat] Though I wouldn't count on their being present.

Id: [0x000888B2]
Now to find Charles... and that damned box.

Id: [0x000888B5]
Sorry, sir, the palace is closed to visitors at the moment. Please return tomorrow.

Id: [0x000888B6]
But I am supposed to be in a meeting right now.

Id: [0x000888B7]
Then you should already be inside. Come back and sell your wool tomorrow.

Id: [0x000888B9]
Lucky for him, I can find another way in.

Id: [0x000888BC]
That's him! Charles Dorian.

Id: [0x000888C3]
[FR][J'ai pratiqué longuement avec mon fusil, je l'aurai dans le mille cette fois-çi.](I've been practicing my aim, I'll get a bullseye this time.)

Id: [0x000888C7]
I should have killed you while you still called yourself an Assassin. It's time I completed your [FR]education.

Id: [0x000888D1]
Gentlemen, I will protect this artifact with my very life.

Id: [0x000888D5]
Arno? Where have you gone?

Id: [0x000888D9]
You! You're the traitor.

Id: [0x000888DA]
I'm just finishing old business.

Id: [0x000888DB]
Old... Connor and his Assassins... The American Revolution undid your Templar business.

Id: [0x000888DC]
Then perhaps we shall start a revolution of our own.

Id: [0x000888E1]
{559329}{559329}{559329}The mentor was right.[laughing] I do make... a good... distraction.

Id: [0x000888E2]
So, cabbage farmer, are you still convinced the Templars are right?

Id: [0x000888E3]
Convinced to the end.

Id: [0x000888E4]
{559332}{559332}{559332}And your Templars bring life?

Id: [0x000888E5]
{559333}{559333}{559333}Life for entire nations, not just a chosen few.

Id: [0x000888E7]
You bastard! Achilles and Liam have already headed north.

Id: [0x000888E9]
{559337}{559337}{559337}So long, Captain Joseph.

Id: [0x000888EA]
{559338}{559338}{559338}Captain Cormac, I must advise you, this course is highly unusual.

Id: [0x000888EB]
{559339}{559339}{559339}How so, Master Cook?

Id: [0x000888EC]
{559340}{559340}{559340}Well, and I do not mean to be alarming, but it seems to be headed for the Northwest Passage. We're stopping before Baffin Island, naturally. But still...

Id: [0x000888ED]
{559341}{559341}{559341}Would that be such a bad thing, Master Cook? We could visit the Ottomans, or the Chinese!

Id: [0x000888EE]
{559342}{559342}{559342}Well, while the theory of a Northwest Passage is sound, in practice none have gotten close to one.

Id: [0x000888EF]
{559343}{559343}{559343}Master Cook, you strike me as one who could prove that theory.

Id: [0x000888F1]
{559345}{559345}{559345}Thank you, Captain. I take that as a great compliment.

Id: [0x000888F3]
Master Cook, how far south have you travelled?

Id: [0x000888F4]
Oh, not far. Only about Nantucket, really.

Id: [0x000888F5]
I knew a man from there... But that's another matter. Have you not even been to the West Indies?

Id: [0x000888F6]
Not yet. But the West Indies are well-mapped already.

Id: [0x000888F7]
Ah, you're looking for a challenge, are you?

Id: [0x000888F8]
Well, frankly, yes. My skills are better suited to newly-discovered regions, like Newfoundland and Labrador.

Id: [0x000888F9]
Say I saw a map... I can't say from where.

Id: [0x000888FA]
A delicate matter? Diplomatic perhaps?

Id: [0x000888FB]
You get my meaning. On this map, there were lands I think no man has seen. Well, no man from our Empire at least.

Id: [0x000888FC]
A land no man has seen... You have me intrigued, where is it?

Id: [0x000888FD]
I think we know a group that might sponsor such a voyage...

Id: [0x000888FE]
South of the Japans and China. As far east of Madagascar as Lisbon is from Boston.

Id: [0x000888FF]
But... there's nothing there. And it would take an unusually provisioned ship to even attempt such a journey.

Id: [0x00088900]
I'll tell you more later, Captain Cook. A man could make his name with such a daring discovery.

Id: [0x00088902]
I gather you have some history with our friend de la Verendrye.

Id: [0x00088903]
A history of instant loathing. I should have known not to trust... my friends who embraced such a wretch.

Id: [0x00088904]
My goodness, what could this fellow have done to inspire such enmity? I know him only as one of a family of explorers, extending the boundaries of the known world.

Id: [0x00088905]
That's a polite way of saying he's a cantankerous bastard.

Id: [0x00088908]
From the brief encounters I've had with him, I can tell you he's an irascible person.

Id: [0x00088909]
But do his actions surpass his words?

Id: [0x0008890A]
I suspect history will believe so, my dear Cook.

Id: [0x0008890B]
The actions that enter the history books in any case.

Id: [0x0008890C]
{559372}{559372}{559372}Over this last year, I have learned what a man of personal integrity and honor you are. That is why I must apologize for my crime, taking and keeping your property.

Id: [0x0008890D]
!*You are a friend indeed. You have the gratitude of my people, young Shay Patrick Cormac.(beat) For as long as you shall walk this earth, you will have a place here, among us.

Id: [0x0008890E]
!*My thanks.

Id: [0x0008891E]
Thanks for your help, Captain Cook.

Id: [0x0008891F]
You are welcome, Captain Cormac. Sailing with you is certainly... interesting.

Id: [0x00088920]
Trouble does seem to find us, it's true.

Id: [0x00088921]
Tell me the truth... Are you fellows with a larger organization?

Id: [0x00088923]
The Board of Admiralty. You take your orders directly from His Majesty, don't you?

Id: [0x00088924]
We couldn't tell you even if we were.

Id: [0x00088925]
You should have these maps. De la Verendrye won't need them anymore.

Id: [0x00088926]
We'll contact you in regards to sponsoring future voyages, Captain.

Id: [0x00088927]
Much obliged.

Id: [0x00088929]
Man your post, Gist! The Colonel's in trouble.

Id: [0x0008892A]
{559402}{559402}{559402}Has it really been a year?

Id: [0x00088935]
Shay! Colonel Monro told us what happened!

Id: [0x00088936]
You sir, are a fool, but thanks.[Laugh]

Id: [0x0008893E]
Whatever you say, Gist.

Id: [0x0008893F]
You and I will get along just fine, I should think!

Id: [0x00088951]
As the Colonel says!

Id: [0x00088954]
{559444}{559444}{559444}Aye, Captain. And one full of good work for the Templars. The next time the Grand Master comes to visit, I am sure he would like to meet you.

Id: [0x0008896B]
{559467}{559467}{559467}If those thugs were part of a gang, the Finnegan's aren't safe. I should do something...

Id: [0x00088974]
Now you have a proper vantage point.

Id: [0x00088978]
Use all your senses together to find prey.

Id: [0x0008897B]
It is time for the hunt.

Id: [0x0008897E]
Killing should not be meaningless. We must use what nature gives us.

Id: [0x00088980]
You have done well. But do not get overconfident, nature has more danger in store.

Id: [0x00088982]
Can you kill without being noticed?

Id: [0x00088985]
Take the high ground, Shay. Dispatching from the air is most effective.

Id: [0x00088987]
Stay low and stick to the brush. Be patient and you might hit your target.

Id: [0x00088989]
Ah, the classic haystack. Hide in it, then surprise your target when he gets close.

Id: [0x0008898B]
Attack from around a corner and your target will never know what hit him.

Id: [0x0008898E]
Top form, Shay.

Id: [0x00088990]
Nicely done. I am surprised.

Id: [0x00088992]
You certainly know how to handle yourself.

Id: [0x00088995]
You did better than I expected.

Id: [0x00088997]
Too slow, Shay. You will miss your chance!

Id: [0x00088999]
Do not let them see you coming.

Id: [0x0008899B]
Variety is the spice of life. Try it another way.<br>

Id: [0x0008899E]
Achilles has one more thing to show you.

Id: [0x000889A1]
Shoot these targets. You can take your time... But not too much, we have more work after this.

Id: [0x000889A4]
Anyone can hit targets standing still. Let's see how you do on the run.

Id: [0x000889A7]
You're doing alright, Shay. But don't let the others vex you, they mean well, though they'll never show it.

Id: [0x000889AA]
Achilles has one more thing to show you. Go on, get a move on.

Id: [0x000889AD]
With these, you can keep your pistols close.

Id: [0x000889B1]
I hope that you will demonstrate more skill to your other teachers.

Id: [0x000889B4]
Achilles has one more thing to show you.

Id: [0x000889CD]
{559565}{559565}{559565}We both know this Manuscript is of tremendous value. Johnson has left in search of reinforcements, and the Grand Master is away. You are the only person left I can trust. Please, accept its return and keep it safe. Future generations may benefit from its knowledge even if ours remains ignorant.

Id: [0x000889D1]
{559569}{559569}{559569}What was it?

Id: [0x000889D2]
{559570}{559570}{559570}The old couple dug at the ground and found a small child. He had come to them from the World Beneath the Earth.

Id: [0x000889D5]
Help! Save the Colonel!

Id: [0x000889D8]
A formidable line of defense.

Id: [0x000889D9]
If we can avoid the ice!

Id: [0x000889E6]
I know you can do better, Shay! Try again.

Id: [0x000889E7]
Almost! Better luck next time.

Id: [0x000889E8]
You can shoot better than that, come on!

Id: [0x000889EA]
Come on! Hurry up!

Id: [0x000889EB]
Faster!

Id: [0x000889EC]
Reload!

Id: [0x000889ED]
You're almost there!

Id: [0x000889EE]
Time is running out!

Id: [0x000889F0]
{559600}{559600}{559600}What a queer story. I won't hear anything more... I might as well train after all.

Id: [0x000889F2]
What course would you have me set, Shay?

Id: [0x000889F3]
Time to report back to the Mentor, wouldn't you agree?

Id: [0x000889F5]
Don’t force me to do this, Shay!

Id: [0x000889F8]
Your luck has run out, Shay. Give it up!

Id: [0x000889FA]
I can see you!

Id: [0x000889FB]
I will not let you run away.

Id: [0x000889FC]
You cannot escape!

Id: [0x000889FD]
You will have to run faster than that!

Id: [0x000889FF]
Haven't I taught you anything?

Id: [0x00088A00]
How could you, Shay?

Id: [0x00088A01]
Have you gone mad?

Id: [0x00088A02]
Won't you listen to reason, Shay?

Id: [0x00088A04]
Fire the mortars!

Id: [0x00088A05]
He's here!

Id: [0x00088A06]
You missed him, [FR][Crétins!](idiots!)

Id: [0x00088A07]
Shoot! Shoot!

Id: [0x00088A08]
Arno! Where are you?

Id: [0x00088A09]
Stop playing Arno. Time to come out.

Id: [0x00088A0A]
Arno? Arno?

Id: [0x00088A0B]
Have you seen my son Arno?

Id: [0x00088A19]
{559641}{559641}{559641}You have to kill them all!

Id: [0x00088A1A]
{559642}{559642}{559642}It's the only way to sustain the memory!

Id: [0x00088A26]
This is bizarre... These memories seem to take place some 20 years after the one we just saw.

Id: [0x00088A27]
If he is the man I believe him to be, then he has... Keep going.

Id: [0x00088A29]
Alright, numbskull, we don't know where Shay is, or what he's doing there. So keep your eyes and ears open.

Id: [0x00088A2A]
I want to know the reason Shay came to this place.

Id: [0x00088A2B]
You heard the man. Let's move!

Id: [0x00088A2C]
{559660}{559660}{559660}Keep going!

Id: [0x00088A2D]
{559661}{559661}{559661}Do not lose him. Focus on your target.

Id: [0x00088A2E]
{559662}{559662}{559662}Whatever you say, Mister Frost.

Id: [0x00088A30]
{559664}{559664}{559664}Is that all to this memory?

Id: [0x00088A31]
That's all the data we have. We can't explore this memory further... for now.

Id: [0x00088A33]
He's a Templar and a politician, what's there to like?

Id: [0x00088A34]
Good! Hoist anchor!

Id: [0x00088A35]
Some blockade.

Id: [0x00088A54]
!*I had word from Hope recently: Master Franklin is still working on a way to invigorate that box.

Id: [0x00088A55]
!*But he doesn't have the box.

Id: [0x00088A56]
!*Well, no. Franklin's experiments are dangerous, so he is using models instead of the artifact itself.

Id: [0x00088A57]
!*I suppose that's prudent.

Id: [0x00088A58]
!*It also gives the Templars a chance to ask the opinion of other scientists. Our Brothers in Switzerland spotted Smith visiting a mathematician named Daniel Bernouilli.

Id: [0x00088A59]
!*I wonder what a mathematician does all day.

Id: [0x00088A5A]
!*Maths, I imagine.

Id: [0x00088A6D]
{559725}{559725}{559725}Doesn't sound like much of an intellectual to me.

Id: [0x00088A6E]
{559726}{559726}{559726}Well then, I'll show him some action of my own.

Id: [0x00088A72]
You wretch! How dare you!

Id: [0x00088A83]
We're right in their path! We have to sink that fireship or get out of their way!

Id: [0x00088A88]
What do you care? You redcoats are nothing but landlords. The townsfolk here are grinding away, trying to make a living.

Id: [0x00088A89]
I cannot blame you for having that impression. Some of my comrades have been less than helpful. But I take a different approach.

Id: [0x00088A8A]
And what is that?

Id: [0x00088A8B]
I care. I want to see these colonists safe and prosperous.

Id: [0x00088A8C]
Noble words.

Id: [0x00088A8D]
Perhaps actions will convince you, Master Cormac.

Id: [0x00088A8E]
It almost sounds like you have good will towards the people you govern.

Id: [0x00088A8F]
I do not govern, Master Cormac. I merely assist.

Id: [0x00088A90]
Look, their bird is nested right over there.

Id: [0x00088A92]
That's my ship, friend. Begging your pardon but I must go fetch her back from those louts.

Well! You seem more than capable of taking care of this matter.[clearing his throat] Tell you what. I shall find a new crew for your vessel in case you have to leave post-haste.

Id: [0x00088A96]
As your first mate, may I suggest our next destination? The Colonel will be expecting me to report back.

Id: [0x00088A97]
My thoughts exactly. Colonel Monro said he'd be in Albany.

Id: [0x00088A98]
Splendid!

Id: [0x00088A9E]
The Colonel waits in Albany... I wonder what he has in mind for us to do next.

Id: [0x00088A9F]
Us? I thought you just wanted to check in with Monro, not sign me up for the army.

Id: [0x00088AA0]
Not at all, Shay! But I admire the Colonel's ideals and want to make them happen.

Id: [0x00088AA1]
What kind of ideals?

Id: [0x00088AA2]
{559778}{559778}{559778}Years ago, I started a business here. It failed miserably. Most expensive mistake I made in my life.

Id: [0x00088AA3]
{559779}{559779}{559779}And this inspires you why?

Id: [0x00088AA4]
{559780}{559780}{559780}Because this land is full of opportunities. Anywhere else, I would have been marked for life by that failure. Here, it is merely another opportunity. I took up surveying. Great business, that. Fresh air, fine scenery, new people.

Id: [0x00088AA5]
Secure borders, prosperous farms, fair trade... We need those in these wretched colonies.

Id: [0x00088AA7]
Sounds like a high-minded utopia.

Id: [0x00088AA8]
It rather does! Want to help make it happen?

Id: [0x00088AA9]
Colonel Monro is an intriguing man, and he certainly seems honorable. We'll head for Albany. After that, I'll see.

Id: [0x00088AAE]
Will you join us, Master Cormac?

Id: [0x00088AAF]
Aye. Enough innocents have died already.

Id: [0x00088AB0]
Don't make me do this, Le Chasseur!

Id: [0x00088AB1]
Do what, assassinate me? I thought that was your specialty.

Id: [0x00088AB2]
We could both just leave.

Id: [0x00088AB3]
Ah, but then I would tell your Brothers that you are alive.

Id: [0x00088AB4]
You have to kill me, Shay.

Id: [0x00088AB6]
{559798}{559798}{559798}Burn them all!

Id: [0x00088AB7]

Id: [0x00088AC3]
I see him! There!

Id: [0x00088AC5]
Stop right there!

Id: [0x00088AC7]
Don't move!

Id: [0x00088AC9]
Stay where you are!

Id: [0x00088ACB]
He's right there!

Id: [0x00088ACE]
Captain, I hate to tell you, but I haven't seen the Gerfaut.

Id: [0x00088ACF]
Me either, and that ship's too big to hide. But de la Verendrye has friends here on the island. I'll find out where his true course lies.

Id: [0x00088AED]
{559853}{559853}{559853}Captain on deck!

Id: [0x00088AF3]
I saw you!

Id: [0x00088AF5]
Here you are!

Id: [0x00088AF7]
Don't even think about it!

Id: [0x00088AF9]
Hey!

Id: [0x00088AFB]
Too noisy!

Id: [0x00088AFF]
Aren't you supposed to be training?

Id: [0x00088B01]
Making others wait for you, as usual?

Id: [0x00088B03]
Are you still here? Find something to do or I will find something for you.

Id: [0x00088B18]
How goes your training?

Id: [0x00088B1A]
I hear Mistress Hope was looking for you.

Id: [0x00088B1C]
I heard that Liam's waiting for you... Seen him yet?

Id: [0x00088B1E]
I wonder where all the raccoons went...

Id: [0x00088B20]
Adéwalé looked worried earlier.

Id: [0x00088B23]
That will help with smoke...

Ahhhh!

Id: [0x00088B76]
No!

Why won't it stop?

What is this?

It's collapsing!

Where are you Uncle Miguel?

Id: [0x00088B94]
Have you seen my son Carlos?

Id: [0x00088B96]
Please, my little boy, have you seen him?

Id: [0x00088B98]
No!

Id: [0x00088B9A]
My God, what is happening?

Id: [0x00088B9C]
It's collapsing!

Good Assassins never fall.

Id: [0x00088BDE]
I am waiting...

Id: [0x00088BEA]
God, Hope... What are you doing with these felons? Turning the city against itself? What have you become?

Id: [0x00088BEC]
Is something the matter, Master Cormac?

Id: [0x00088BED]
No no, yes, just... old memories.

Id: [0x00088BEE]
When I am issued new recruits burdened with regrets, I tell them the surest way to lose them is with gunpowder.

Id: [0x00088BEF]
You're right, Colonel.

Id: [0x00088BFE]
Colonel... The Manuscript. Why return it to me?

Id: [0x00088BFF]
Because, Master Cormac, you earned my trust. It could not be in better hands.

Id: [0x00088C00]
Respectfully, sir...[offering the Manuscript to MONRO] I'm more of a target than you now.

Id: [0x00088C03]
Gentlemen? Kesegowaase is rallying to storm Albany. His allies threaten a friendly Oneida village, and French troops have already entered our territory.

Id: [0x00088C04]
I might be able to delay the French and help the Oneida.

Id: [0x00088C05]
We will ready the defenses in Albany.

Id: [0x00088C0A]
I am called Onatah.

Id: [0x00088C0E]
There is a legend among my people. It tells of how the land under our feet was born, and how good and evil came into this world.

Id: [0x00088C0F]
{560143}{560143}{560143}But what does this have to do with survival?

Id: [0x00088C10]
The Sky Woman scattered her wisdom throughout our land.

Id: [0x00088C11]
{560145}{560145}{560145}The Sky Woman... Alright, I'll listen.

Id: [0x00088C13]
If you follow her path, you shall learn the true history of our people... and perhaps even uncover the reward locked within this cave...

Id: [0x00088C14]
You honor me, venerable one.

Id: [0x00088C15]
It is you who honor us, Shay Patrick Cormac. Farewell.

Id: [0x00088C1A]
My son, Arno... Perhaps you have seen him?

Id: [0x00088C1C]
Have you see a little boy around? I'm looking for my son.

Id: [0x00088C2C]
AAAAHHH!

Id: [0x00088C2D]
Wait here. I have something for ya.

Id: [0x00088C74]
{560244}{560244}{560244}Gist, you and the Colonel seem inspired. Is there something in the water, or in the whiskey?

Id: [0x00088C80]
{560256}{560256}{560256}Dear God! Fireships! Should they break through they would devastate our fleet!

Id: [0x00088C81]
{560257}{560257}{560257}Then we better not let that happen.

Id: [0x00088C82]
{560258}{560258}{560258}I recognize that vessel, sir. It’s Adéwalé!

Id: [0x00088C83]
{560259}{560259}{560259}Begging your pardon, gentlemen, but this is no time for personal feuds.

Id: [0x00088C84]
{560260}{560260}{560260}There’s nothing personal about it. We’ll deal with him after the fireships.

Id: [0x00088C85]
What is the news from Fort William Henry?

Id: [0x00088C86]
The garrison is surrounded and reinforcements are late.

Id: [0x00088C87]
General Montcalm has been blazing a path across the Colonies for King Louis, hasn't he?

Id: [0x00088C8A]
I rather wish he'd stayed home with his mistress.

Id: [0x00088C97]
His or King Louis'?

Id: [0x00088C98]
Either! Though I suspect the King's is finer.

Id: [0x00088C99]
Indeed, Madame O'Murphy is supposed to be quite the charmer.

Id: [0x00088C9A]
An O'Murphy is in the French king's bed? Now I know you're pulling my leg...

Id: [0x00088E08]
Take a look through your spyglass and see for yourself.

Id: [0x00088E09]
We can board and loot her before the crew knows what hit them.

Id: [0x00088E0B]
Now's the time, let's board her!

Id: [0x00088E0D]
Captain, hold your fire! We do not want to sink her!

Id: [0x00088E0F]
Damn! There go our spoils!

Id: [0x00088E11]
Show them what's for, Captain!

Id: [0x00088E12]
Come on men! The spoils are ours!

Id: [0x00088E13]
For the Morrigan!

Id: [0x00088ED1]
{560849}{560849}{560849}You know, I had the misfortune of wintering in Cork once.

Id: [0x00088ED4]
{560852}{560852}{560852}Don't bite the hook, Shay.

Id: [0x00088ED5]
{560853}{560853}{560853}This would be a more pleasant voyage with fewer opinions and more sailing.

Id: [0x00088ED6]
{560854}{560854}{560854}And what was so misfortunate about it?

Id: [0x00088ED7]
{560855}{560855}{560855}Unfortunate. And don't.

Id: [0x00088ED8]
{560856}{560856}{560856}The weather was wet and icy at once. There was not a thing to do in that town. And most of all, the food was [FR]horrible. Nothing but cabbage, potatoes, and salt pork for weeks!

Id: [0x00088ED9]
{560857}{560857}{560857}Well why didn't you get your Gallic arse out of there?

Id: [0x00088EDA]
{560858}{560858}{560858}What part of wintering do you not understand, cabbage farmer? My ship and I were stuck in that pit until spring!

Id: [0x00088EDB]
{560859}{560859}{560859}A single home in that "pit" has more fine upstanding people in it than you could find in your whole louse-ridden country!

Id: [0x00088FA6]
[FR][Morgane](Morrigan)... The silly fairy queen who ruined Merlin the Wise. Oh oh... She is perfect for you, Shay.

Id: [0x00088FA7]
The Morrigan was an old goddess, the Queen of War and Darkness. She harvested the souls of fallen warriors. Perfect indeed.

Id: [0x00088FA9]
{561065}{561065}{561065}Do you swear to uphold the principles of our order and all that for which we stand?

Id: [0x00088FB6]
{561078}{561078}{561078}I do.

Id: [0x00088FB7]
{561079}{561079}{561079}And never to share our secrets nor divulge the true nature of our work?

Id: [0x00088FBA]
{561082}{561082}{561082}I do.

Id: [0x00088FBB]
{561083}{561083}{561083}Then we welcome you into our fold, brother.

Will your friend the spy be waiting for us?

Id: [0x00089003]
Yes. Let us hope Le Chasseur has more information about the manuscript.

Id: [0x00089005]
There it is. Anticosti.

Id: [0x00089006]
Are you sure? There's a fleet to rival Liverpool's docks.

Id: [0x00089007]
We prefer to... discourage unwanted visitors. Such as our friends back there.

Id: [0x00089013]
[FR][Arretez !](Stop) What are you doing? I have no quarrel with you!

Id: [0x00089014]
You uncultured swine, you should not have left your backwater colony!

Id: [0x00089015]
[FR][Ouais, retourne à Boston!](Yeah, go back to Boston!)

Id: [0x00089016]
Help! Help!

Id: [0x00089025]
Shay, is that you? How long has it been?[beat] Er, where are my manners. Thank you, my friend, thank you! But... what are you doing in Paris?

Id: [0x00089026]
With all due respect, sir, this is no time to talk. You're still in danger.

Id: [0x00089044]
But hold your fire. We must not damage the Box or risk losing it to the sea.

Id: [0x00089046]
Careful, you simpleton! You will destroy the Box!

Id: [0x00089048]
Enough! This is not a game, cabbage farmer!

Id: [0x0008904A]
We can't risk losing the Precursor box, Capt'n!

Id: [0x0008904F]
Look, Captain! He's cutting through the ice!

Id: [0x00089050]
It seems you are not the only one equipped with such a ram, Shay.

Id: [0x00089051]
Let us hope ours fares just as well.

Id: [0x00089052]
Can't this bucket go any faster?

Id: [0x00089053]
At least my ship is still sea-worthy, Chevalier.

Id: [0x00089054]
{561236}{561236}{561236}If only we could take advantage. There's no way we can follow through the ice.

Id: [0x00089055]
{561237}{561237}{561237}Perhaps there's another way. We may not be able to shoot Smith, but what about the ice cliff?

Id: [0x00089056]
{561238}{561238}{561238}And use the [FR]debris to smash the ice sheet? A typically brutish approach. But it may work.

Id: [0x00089057]
{561239}{561239}{561239}Act quickly or he will escape.

Id: [0x00089059]
{561241}{561241}{561241}We should hit the ice now. He's getting away!

Id: [0x0008905A]
Once more your fortune holds. But do not waste time congratulating yourself. Smith is getting away.

Id: [0x0008905C]
It worked! The way is clear!

Id: [0x0008905D]
{561245}{561245}{561245}How could you ever doubt me?

Id: [0x0008905E]
{561246}{561246}{561246}Must we waste time congratulating each other? We're losing the manuscript.

Id: [0x0008905F]
{561247}{561247}{561247}Don't worry. Smith can't have dragged himself too far.

Id: [0x00089060]
It's an ambush!

Id: [0x00089063]
I don't see Smith's ship!

Id: [0x00089064]
Let's get rid of these distractions first. We'll find him.

Id: [0x00089067]
And now we know where he was headed. The bastard has an encampment here.

Id: [0x00089068]
I'll take care of this.

Id: [0x0008913F]
{561471}{561471}{561471}Ha! Are you trying to scare me?

Id: [0x00089140]
{561472}{561472}{561472}I heard powder fired about here.

Id: [0x00089141]
{561473}{561473}{561473}Hmmm... It must of been bloody close.

Id: [0x00089142]

Id: [0x0008914B]
{561483}{561483}{561483}He may be wearing a disguise of some sort.

Id: [0x0008914C]
{561484}{561484}{561484}He's only wanted for questioning so try not to scare him off.

Id: [0x0008914D]

Id: [0x0008914E]
{561486}{561486}{561486}Some sort of commotion there last night.

Id: [0x0008916E]
{561518}{561518}{561518}The alarm!

Id: [0x0008916F]
{561519}{561519}{561519}That's the alarm!

Id: [0x00089170]

Id: [0x00089171]
{561521}{561521}{561521}Right, check that side.

Id: [0x00089172]
{561522}{561522}{561522}Have a look there.

Id: [0x00089173]
{561523}{561523}{561523}Search there, go.

Id: [0x00089174]
{561524}{561524}{561524}Oh, piss on it. Best get back.

Id: [0x00089175]
{561525}{561525}{561525}Not worth the effort.

Id: [0x00089176]
{561526}{561526}{561526}He could be playing the mouse here...

Id: [0x00089177]
{561527}{561527}{561527}Wait... what if he didn't run on?

Id: [0x00089178]
{561528}{561528}{561528}No…

Id: [0x00089179]

Id: [0x0008917C]

Id: [0x0008917D]
{561533}{561533}{561533}Press on, we'll get him!

Id: [0x0008917E]
{561534}{561534}{561534}Fall in, he can't lose us!

Id: [0x0008917F]
{561535}{561535}{561535}This way, hurry!

Id: [0x00089180]
{561536}{561536}{561536}Ha, knew it!

Id: [0x00089181]
{561537}{561537}{561537}Got you now!

Id: [0x00089182]
{561538}{561538}{561538}Snug and warm over here?

Id: [0x00089183]
{561539}{561539}{561539}Mousy in this hole?

Id: [0x00089184]
{561540}{561540}{561540}That's a nice mouse hole.

Id: [0x00089185]
{561541}{561541}{561541}Shit. Where did he go?

Id: [0x00089186]
{561542}{561542}{561542}So bloody close! Raaarr!

Id: [0x00089187]
{561543}{561543}{561543}Hey! Get him!

Id: [0x00089188]

Id: [0x0008918A]

Id: [0x0008918B]
{561547}{561547}{561547}He won't get away, he'll tire!

Id: [0x0008918C]
{561548}{561548}{561548}Can't run forever, just keep up!

Id: [0x0008918D]
{561549}{561549}{561549}We're bound to cross another patrol!

Id: [0x0008918E]
{561550}{561550}{561550}How long can you keep this up?

Id: [0x0008918F]
{561551}{561551}{561551}Die like a man!

Id: [0x00089190]
{561552}{561552}{561552}Trying to give us the slip maggot?

Id: [0x00089191]
{561553}{561553}{561553}You really think we won't catch you? Ha!

Id: [0x00089192]
{561554}{561554}{561554}Keep dreaming you dumb cur!

Id: [0x00089193]
{561555}{561555}{561555}Futile! You can't escape us!

Id: [0x00089194]
{561556}{561556}{561556}There! Get him!

Id: [0x00089195]
{561557}{561557}{561557}There! On him!

Id: [0x00089196]
{561558}{561558}{561558}Aha! Now you die!

Id: [0x00089197]
{561559}{561559}{561559}Here he is, go!

Id: [0x00089198]
{561560}{561560}{561560}Move! Stand clear!

Id: [0x00089199]

Id: [0x0008919A]
{561562}{561562}{561562}Clear off! Move!

Id: [0x00089492]
Do you swear to uphold the principles of our order and all that for which we stand?

Id: [0x00089493]
I do.

Id: [0x00089494]
And never to share our secrets nor divulge the true nature of our work?

Id: [0x00089495]
I do.

Id: [0x00089496]
And to do so from now until death - whatever the cost?

Id: [0x00089497]
I do.

Id: [0x00089498]
Then we welcome you into our fold, brother.

Id: [0x00089499]
{562329}{562329}{562329}Things move so quickly these days. I understand you already have a ring?

Id: [0x0008949B]
You are now a Templar, harbinger of a New World.

May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0008949E]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x000894CB]
Cass!

Id: [0x000894CC]
Attack!

Id: [0x0008954A]
My word this is heavy.

Id: [0x0008954D]
Don't look now, but I think I'm being followed.

Id: [0x0008954E]
I'm sure you're seeing things, but I'll take a butcher's.

Id: [0x00089550]
Hey darling, you up for a pint?

Id: [0x00089551]
{562513}{562513}{562513}Six o'clock, you up for a pint?

Id: [0x00089552]
Sure, if you bring your mates!

Id: [0x00089553]
That's bleak...

Id: [0x00089555]
Hey you! What's this with seizing people's things?

Id: [0x00089556]
We need supplies, sir. And Iron and lead as well... for weapons and ammunitions.

Id: [0x00089557]
We need these things too you know!

Id: [0x00089558]
[sigh]I'm just following orders.

Id: [0x0008955B]
Is that the last of it?

Id: [0x0008955C]
Good, put it with the rest.

Id: [0x00089561]
Did you see that strange stuff in Benjamin Franklin's garden?

Id: [0x00089562]
I keep well clear of that place. They say that man messes with lightning!

Id: [0x00089563]
Speaking of lightning, I reckon there's a storm coming.

Id: [0x00089564]
Aye. Let's hope she demurs until we're off duty.

Id: [0x00089565]
Did you see that?

Id: [0x00089566]
Do you see smoke? Get the fire brigade!

Id: [0x000895B0]
Help! Men, we're under attack!

Id: [0x000895B1]
That hooded man! Get him!

Id: [0x000895B4]
You'll regret this, Assassin!

Id: [0x000895B5]
The Templars will have their revenge!

Id: [0x000895B6]
A whole battalion will be after you!

Id: [0x000895B8]
Shut up, woman!

Id: [0x000895B9]
Ow!

Id: [0x000895BA]
Leave her alone!

Id: [0x000895BD]
Huh, master Franklin, sir. My name is Shay and this is my associate Hope.

Id: [0x000895BF]
{562623}{562623}{562623}Oh, I'm no professor.

Id: [0x000895C0]
Thank you, but I am afraid I must delay my experiment.

Id: [0x000895C2]
Delay it? Why?

Id: [0x000895C3]
The army confiscated my lightning rods. They are essential to conducting the electricity I need to vivify your Box.

Id: [0x000895C4]
Master Johnson would not want you to have to wait.

Id: [0x000895C5]
Perhaps there is something you can do then.

Id: [0x000895C7]
Soldiers have been hauling things away all day. Perhaps they could tell you where they have taken my lightning rods so you could get them back.

Id: [0x000895C8]
At your service, sir.

Id: [0x000895C9]
Begin your investigation at the market near the docks.

Id: [0x000895CD]
So, Master Franklin, what is this?

Id: [0x000895CE]
A Leyden jar. It temporarily stores power in the form of vitreous and resinous electricity.

Id: [0x000895CF]
Really? What will you do with the jar when it is full?

Id: [0x000895D0]
Ah, what will I do with all my jars! For this experiment, we will need an entire energy storage system. The many units fire at once, so I call it a "battery". It should make your interpretation box operate.

Id: [0x000895D1]
{562641}{562641}{562641}What're you rolling about on the ground for?

Id: [0x000895D2]

Id: [0x00089D07]

Id: [0x00089D13]
!*This a pity. You were a good for nothing drunkard, but you had your moments.

Id: [0x00089D14]
!*You were a good soldier, rest in peace.

Id: [0x00089D15]
!*One less to kill!

Id: [0x00089D16]
!*I'll take credit for this one!

Id: [0x00089D17]
!*Ha! I hope death was as painful as it looks.

Id: [0x00089D18]

Id: [0x00089D19]

Id: [0x00089D1A]

Id: [0x00089D1D]

Id: [0x00089D1E]
!*Oy, get your scratchy arse here and start looking for our troublemaker!

Id: [0x00089D1F]
!*I'm not bothering you am I? Stop pulling your nose hairs and start looking for who did that!

Id: [0x00089D20]
!*I would hate to be a bother, but last time I checked, I outranked you. Get your sorry arse here and start helping clear that mess.

Id: [0x00089D21]

Id: [0x00089D22]
!*Oh come now you lazy bastards, give me a hand here!

Id: [0x00089D23]
!*I won't be stuck sorting this shite alone, bring your arses here!

Id: [0x00089D24]
!*No, don't mind me, I'm just a poor soldier stuck with a squad's load of work.

Id: [0x00089D25]
!*I can't solve this one alone, I better find a scapegoat.

Id: [0x00089D26]
!*(Sigh) Of course, all the others decided they'd rather be elsewhere. Fine, I'll find the culprit myself.

Id: [0x00089D27]
!*Cretin! You had to ruin a perfectly fine day with your murdering ways!

Id: [0x00089D28]
!*I don't care what your story is, I'm pinning this one on you!

Id: [0x00089D29]
!*Oh, so that was YOU! I'll put a stop to your nefarious schemes!

Id: [0x00089D2A]
!*God's Beard! What just happened here? You there, stop!

Id: [0x00089D2B]
!*Who's the troublemaker here, I want to know right NOW!

Id: [0x00089D2C]
!*All right, all right, what's wrong here? You're the one responsible, are you?

Id: [0x0008A191]
!*Try to shoot me now, fool!

Id: [0x0008A192]
!*Stand still!

Can you come to the elevator already? I said please. Okay, you’re right, I didn’t. But come to the elevator anyway.

When you're done wandering around, come see me at the elevator.

Id: [0x0008A917]
Shay Cormac. I hear you are the Templars' new don of Precursor archaeology.

Id: [0x0008A918]
I'm no expert, sir. I just witnessed what the Assassins can do with those damned sites.

Id: [0x0008A91A]
I have spent years investigating Precursor leads. Tell me what you've seen.

Id: [0x0008A91B]
Well, I know both the Assassins and Templars are looking for Pieces of Eden. Powerful weapons, mind-controlling Apples... But this time it's different. We haven't found an apple, but... a tree.

Id: [0x0008A91C]
{567580}{567580}{567580}Continue.

Id: [0x0008A91D]
These Temples hold the earth together like  roots. Disturb them and Haiti falls. Or Lisbon. Or any other place the Manuscript shows.

Id: [0x0008A91F]
And the Assassins are blindly interfering with these structures?

Id: [0x0008A920]
Aye. And if we don't stop them, they'll continue destroying cities.

Id: [0x0008A921]
{567585}{567585}{567585}I knew this Colonial Brotherhood would be a nuisance, but I had no idea their ambitions had such far-reaching consequences.

A few months, I think. That virus is cutting off our access to complete memories. They’re readable, but messy.

Id: [0x0008BB66]
The Seven Years War will soon break out in the colonies.[beat] Focus on Assassin interference.

Id: [0x0008BB6B]
The memory appears to be fragmented. How much time has passed?

Id: [0x0008BB6C]

Id: [0x0008BB8C]
Haytham Kenway. Son of Edward Kenway and Grand Master of the Colonial Rite.

Id: [0x0008BB8D]
And his son is the Assassin Connor, right?

Id: [0x0008BB8E]
Considering the year, he is likely still unaware of that fact.

Id: [0x0008BB8F]
Well someone's not getting a Father's Day card!

Id: [0x0008BB94]
At this point, the war’s not really over, but the French have lost their momentum in the colonies.

Id: [0x0008BB95]
The Templars can now focus entirely on the Assassins. They still have hundreds of men working for them in New York.

Id: [0x0008BBA4]
{572324}{572324}{572324}I see. So now the Templars can go back to taking care of the Assassins.

Id: [0x0008BBA5]
{572325}{572325}{572325}Precisely.[beat] If my research is correct, Shay will be leading this action.

I was wearing a nice frock and dancing in a posh café in Paris. It was magical!

Id: [0x0008BE80]
Yes, I must have.

Id: [0x0008BE81]
Well, keep it to yourself! I certainly don't want it!

Id: [0x0008BE83]

It was only after Altaïr reformed the Brotherhood with its new ideals of “free will” that the conflict truly escalated and spread across the planet.

Id: [0x0008C3CA]
For if the so-called “Wise Man of the Mountain” can see things from our point of view, surely the same can be said for other Assassins.

Id: [0x0008C43E]
Mackandal was a vicious Mentor, and in his desperate attempt to liberate slaves, he broke his own Creed by indiscriminately killing nobles.

Id: [0x0008C43F]
Misguided as they are, some Assassins are honorable. Mackandal was not one of them.

Id: [0x0008C440]
When his comrade and childhood friend Agaté fled to Louisiana, Baptiste saw the futility of his former life in Mackandal's Brotherhood.

Id: [0x0008C441]
If he could draw Agaté out of hiding and eliminate him, he would be granted a place in the Templar Order.

Id: [0x0008C442]
Although Baptiste was killed by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré, his path clearly demonstrates the inherent superiority of Templar ideals over Assassin terrorism.

Id: [0x0008C443]
Through their correspondence, Torres offered a less violent way to achieve their mutual goals, by using Precursor artifacts as a surveillance system rather than the murders and scheming favored by the Brotherhood.

Id: [0x0008C444]
Although Duncan’s story does not have a happy ending, it clearly demonstrates that the Templars' highest goals of peace and order need not exclude personal success and achievement.

Consider him an ally, but watch what you say around him.

Id: [0x0008C467]
With this bloody war over, we'll finally bring order to this damned continent!

Id: [0x0008C468]
I fear it will take more than that, friend.

Id: [0x0008C46A]
We may not get another chance, Shay. We need to kill Adéwalé.

Id: [0x0008C46B]
That scallywag freed hundreds of slaves in his days, and continues to do so. He promises them freedom, but then turns these poor sods into his own private army. Them men and women fight the local authorities, kill nobles, and cause dissention wherever they go.

Id: [0x0008C46C]
They bring chaos to the world. Adéwalé must die.

Id: [0x0008C46D]
I understand.

Id: [0x009897E5]
!*Not Bad Thatch! But my throw be closer.

Id: [0x009897E6]
!*All right lad, But I be taking these two anyway.

Id: [0x009897E7]
!*Ah, bloody pirate... Alright Thatch, you enjoy yourself there. I'll be right back.

Id: [0x009897EB]
!*Goddamn Lobsters! They won't quit!

Id: [0x009897EC]
!*It's your Trick at the Helm, Kenway. I'll bark the Orders.

Id: [0x009897EF]
!*Fire!

Id: [0x009897F0]
!*Load the Cannons you scrubs!

Id: [0x009897F1]
!*Aim at their Waist!

Id: [0x009897F5]
!*Bring that Beastie down!

Id: [0x009897F8]
!*He's a big bastard! Load the heavy Shot, Lads!

Id: [0x009897F9]
!*We've breached their HULL! Man the swivels!

Id: [0x009897FC]
!*Bring it to them, Lads!!

Id: [0x009897FE]
!*She's Breached! Keep at her!

Id: [0x00989800]
!*Her mizzen's cracked! All hands to the Rails.

Id: [0x00989801]
!*Put your Hooks in her!

Id: [0x00989802]
!*Reeve off and hop the Rails! Let's send these Puppies to the Devil!

Id: [0x00989804]
!*Are we spitting poppy Seeds? Load the heavy shot!

Id: [0x00989805]
!*They're you go! That Shot'll sink'em!

Id: [0x0098980B]
!*I drink Damnation to you and your Men, cowardly Puppies all!

Id: [0x0098980C]
!*Bury the Lot, Boys. Take no Guff!

Id: [0x0098980D]
!*I'll cleave ye lengthwise, Maggots!

Id: [0x0098980E]
!*How you be doing, Edward m'lad?

Id: [0x0098980F]
!*I'll not fall here, today Bastards. Come at me!

Id: [0x00989810]
!*Can you fight free, lad? Can ye make it clear?

Id: [0x00989811]
!*Here's the Path to Perdition!

Id: [0x00989876]
!*Captain Blackbeard brings too much Attention on himself. Perhaps it isn't wise to be drawn into his Madness.

Id: [0x00989877]
!*There's Method in it. And the Seas would be poorer without him.

Id: [0x0098987A]
!*Careful, Captain. We're drifting close to a Watchtower.

Id: [0x0098987B]
!*Them Watchtower's might spot us. Best keep out of Sight.

Id: [0x0098987C]
!*There's another Watchtower, sir.

Id: [0x00989882]
!*Careful with the Banks.

Id: [0x00989883]
!*Let us hope the river remains this wide.

Id: [0x00989884]
!*Be sure they don't spy us trailing them.

Id: [0x00989885]
!*Steady does it, captain.

Id: [0x00989886]
!*I see them. Over there.

Id: [0x00989887]
!*If we run aground here we may never get out.

Id: [0x0098988A]
!*All stop.

Id: [0x0098988B]
!*There's always another Way.

Id: [0x00989894]
!*We're nearing that Wreck. Gives me the Willies.

Id: [0x00989895]
!*Is there anything that don't give you the Willies?

Id: [0x00989896]
!*Well, she's like everything else in this bloody Swamp. Dead and waiting.

Id: [0x00989897]
!*You keep rowing like that and we'll be waiting right beside her.

Id: [0x0098989A]
!*You think it's true what they say about Blackbeard? That fire strikes out from his head? As if from some volcano?

Id: [0x0098989D]
!*If he's not the Devil himself, then surely he's made some Pact with Hell. Only be thankful his Ship remains anchored, and hasn't torn a Path into the Heart of Charles-Towne.

Id: [0x0098989E]
!*Bloody Pirates. Someone ought to do something.

Id: [0x0098989F]
!*They'll be hunted down eventually. Every last one of them.

Id: [0x009898A3]
!*What was that?! It was a Crocodile, wasn't it? It's coming straight for us, I can feel it.

Id: [0x009898A4]
!*You know the legends about this swamp, don't you?

Id: [0x009898A6]
!*What?

Id: [0x009898A7]
!*The first slave owners who settled here were a rough, callous bunch. Anyone who showed the least backbone was brought here and fed to the lizards. Now their spirits haunt the bayou, tricking fellows into the maws of the beasts, their tortured souls set upon revenge.

Id: [0x009898AA]
!*Bloody hell, Ryder. Next time keep your legends to yourself.

Id: [0x009898AE]
!*This Blockade best end soon. I'm going land-crazy, and this dirty Puddle won't do.

Id: [0x009898AF]
!*One would suppose all this was for gold. Or Rum at least.

Id: [0x009898B0]
!*Nothing but Medicines to cure whatever ailments fester aboard their vessels.

Id: [0x009898B1]
!*Syphilis and scurvy no doubt. What noxious coffins those pirate ships must be.

Id: [0x009898B4]
!*If Heat or the Reptiles don't finish us, it'll be these damnable Insects.

Id: [0x009898B5]
!*Aye, the Mosquitoes'll sup every last ounce of Vitality from us.

Id: [0x009898B6]
!*That'd be a nicer End than suffocating in some bloody Miasma. Ever seen a man consumed by the yellow Fever?

Id: [0x009898B7]
!*[coughs] You know, I haven't been feel all too well these past few days...

Id: [0x009898BA]
!*Almost there.

Id: [0x009898BB]
!*Good. Captain Wyatt is not a patient man.

Id: [0x009898BC]
!*Patient enough to wait for Blackbeard to tire, it seems.

Id: [0x009898BD]
!*He has his mind set on becoming governor himself one day. Likely sees this as a chance to prove his worth.

Id: [0x009898BE]
!*Gambling with the lives of them that's been taken hostage? Isn't councilman Wraggs among their number?

Id: [0x009898BF]
!*There's little love betwixt those who share power. Particularly when one seeks to rise among his peers. Now steady those oars and make haste. The captain is not above making an example of a tardy soldier.

Id: [0x009898C3]
!*This Heat saps one's Will to live at Times.

Id: [0x009898C4]
!*Damn Mosquitoes!

Id: [0x009898C5]
!*It's Moments like these I miss England the most.

Id: [0x009898C6]
!*Stop your fidgeting, Thomas. There's nothing in those Shadows to startle a grown Man.

Id: [0x009898C7]
!*Did you hear that?! There's Things out there...

Id: [0x009898C8]
!*I saw a Shadow in the water!

Id: [0x009898C9]
!*It's a balmy Night, and no Mistake.

Id: [0x009898CB]
!*Private Ryder reporting, sir.

Id: [0x009898CC]
!*And doing so with great Delay.

Id: [0x009898CD]
!*No change, sir. They're holding fast but are yet to kill or maim any of the Captives, near as we can tell. Perhaps it's time to--

Id: [0x009898CE]
!*To surrender? I've been entrusted with the Affairs of this Town, and I do not intend to bow to the demands of a Pirate, no matter how fierce his Reputation.

Id: [0x009898CF]
!*Yes, sir.

Id: [0x009898D0]
!*As long as the supply Key is with me, no Man shall touch that Medicine. May Plague and Calamity strike them all.

Id: [0x009898D4]
!*Someone's after the captain!

Id: [0x009898D5]
!*What's going on?!

Id: [0x009898D6]
!*Hey! Stop!

Id: [0x009898D7]
!*There's an intruder! Get 'im!

Id: [0x009898D8]
!*Do something!

Id: [0x009898D9]
!*He's going for the captain!

Id: [0x009899B6]
!*Who goes there?!

Id: [0x009899B7]
!*Calm down, Clark, it's only us.

Id: [0x009899BB]
!*Identify yourself!

Id: [0x009899BC]
!*Privates Ryder and Thomas.

Id: [0x009899C0]
!*What's that? Someone there?

Id: [0x009899C1]
!*It's us. We're reporting to the Captain.

Id: [0x009899D4]
!*That's when I grabbed him by the throat and stuck a blade in his gullet.

Id: [0x009899D5]
!*Whoreson had it coming. Still, I'd have slashed him through the mouth. Show everyone what happens when ya don't hold yer tongue.

Id: [0x009899D6]
!*It did the trick. Not a peep from one of 'em all the way to port.

Id: [0x009899D8]
!*Sea turned crimson in a flash. Seven of us thrashing for dear life, and the sharks all a-feasting.

Id: [0x009899D9]
!*How'd ya get out of it?

Id: [0x009899DA]
!*I grabs me a-hold of the first mate on one side and a swabby on the other, and lets the sharks have their fill while I swim for shore.

Id: [0x009899DB]
!*Bah! Yer full of it, yer lying bastard.

Id: [0x009899DC]
!*[laughs in an unsettling way]<CR>

Id: [0x009899DE]
!*Gonna try escaping again, you mongrel?

Id: [0x009899DF]
!*No, sir. No escape. No escape. Please.

Id: [0x009899E0]
!*Oughta slice off yer fucking hands and feet, see how far you get.

Id: [0x009899E1]
!*Please, sir, no! No!

Id: [0x009899E2]
!*But then you wouldn't fetch much of a price, would ya? Just remember, there's other parts no one that buys ya will miss. [laughs]

Id: [0x009899E4]
!*Please, sir, please.

Id: [0x009899E5]
!*You are here to help us, yes?

Id: [0x009899E6]
!*We beg you.

Id: [0x009899E7]
!*Do not leave us here, please. Do not leave us.

Id: [0x009899E9]
!*Thank you! Thank you!

Id: [0x009899EA]
!*You have saved my life.

Id: [0x009899EB]
!*You are good man. Good man.

Id: [0x009899EC]
!*Bless you, sir.

Id: [0x009899EE]
!*Alright, lads. The Medusa'll be here on the morrow to fetch these heathens to market.

Id: [0x009899EF]
!*No beatings, and keep them fed and watered. We don't want to lose any more.

Id: [0x009899F0]
!*Once we have the coin in our pocket, we sail to shore for whores and rum!

Id: [0x00989A47]
!*[Whistling noise to attract attention.]

Id: [0x00989A48]
!*Hello?

Id: [0x00989A49]
!*Lads? Lieutenant? You out here?

Id: [0x00989A4A]
!*Jenkins. Not followed, were you?

Id: [0x00989A4C]
!*Don't think so. Kenway suspects something though. He doesn't miss much.

Id: [0x00989A51]
!*What about our man?

Id: [0x00989A52]
!*They've been pressing him hard all night, but he hasn't broken yet.

Id: [0x00989A55]
!*What was that?

Id: [0x00989A57]
!*You certain you didn't bring some of those sand rats in tow, Jenkins?

Id: [0x00989A59]
!*Look sharp. Stevens, make certain there are no surprises by the temple.

Id: [0x00989A6A]
!*Quickly, send the signal. And remember always this day.

Id: [0x00989A72]
!*Who's that there? In the water?

Id: [0x00989A73]
!*Two old 'gators come for their Supper.

Id: [0x00989A74]
!*Ryder, me old mucker. Bit warm tonight, ain't it?

Id: [0x00989A75]
!*We'll talk about the weather another time, mate. Bit of a hurry.

Id: [0x00989A76]
!*Right-oh.

Id: [0x00989A79]
!*You seen any crocodiles tonight? I could've sworn I saw something pass the boat.

Id: [0x00989A7A]
!*Nope, quiet night.

Id: [0x00989A7B]
!*Are you sure? I heard something in the water.

Id: [0x00989A7C]
!*Quiet 'til you showed up. Go on then. Captain's waiting.

Id: [0x00989A81]
!*Hullo! That Ryder yonder?

Id: [0x00989A82]
!*The very same.

Id: [0x00989A83]
!*Then speed along. You're expected. And you know how-- [screams]

Id: [0x00989A85]
!*Oh Christ!

Id: [0x00989A86]
!*It took him! It took him! I told you!

Id: [0x00989A87]
!*Just row, for godsakes! Row!

Id: [0x00989A89]
!*Bloody hell!

Id: [0x00989A8A]
!*Simon! Simon! He's gone!

Id: [0x00989A8C]
!*I told you there was something! Didn't I tell you? Oh god...

Id: [0x00989A8D]
!*Let's just get out of here.

Id: [0x00989A8F]
!*Can't you make this thing go any faster?

Id: [0x00989A90]
!*Is it after us? Can you see it?

Id: [0x00989A91]
!*Don't think about it. Just row. Row!

Id: [0x00989A95]
!*Bloody hell, I'm suffocating here. I wasn't made for this Climate.

Id: [0x00989A96]
!*It's good practice. We'll all end up in the fires of damnation one day.

Id: [0x00989A97]
!*Speak for yourself. I have my deathbed confession all ready.

Id: [0x00989A99]
!*I hope they give Blackbeard whatever he wants.

Id: [0x00989A9A]
!*Didn't know you had such sympathy for pirates.

Id: [0x00989A9B]
!*Sympathy for my own neck, more like. I say, give him his prize and let him be on his merry way.

Id: [0x00989A9C]
!*You're a credit to the British army.

Id: [0x00989A9D]
!*I apologize, sir. There was an Accident. Private Simon-- this Crocodile, it was huge, it--

Id: [0x00989A9E]
!*I don't care about your Accidents. What's the Word from the Harbor, Soldier? Speak!

Id: [0x00989A9F]
!*What?!

Id: [0x00989AA0]
!*Intruder! Help!

Id: [0x00989B01]
!*I see a Rowboat, Captain. Is it them?

Id: [0x00989B03]
!*I believe it is. If my Information is correct, they should lead us right to whoever is in charge of this godammed Mess.

Id: [0x00989B05]
!*How do we know they will lead us to the Medicine?

Id: [0x00989B06]
!*Because Providence commands it. Besides, I heard it's under the protection of a British Captain, and that's who these errand Boys are reporting to.

Id: [0x00989B08]
!*Keep her at half-sail, Captain. Speed'll do us no Favors in these Waters.

Id: [0x00989B0A]
!*Slow down, Captain. Let them pass by.

Id: [0x00989B0F]
!*Where the hell is Kenway? He's missing a sweet morsel!

Id: [0x00989B10]
!*Note the day, lads! Today we send the King's finest to their graves!

Id: [0x00989B11]
!*Aye, sir.

Id: [0x00989B12]
!*Secure the other side and watch the path.

Id: [0x00989B13]
!*Aye.

Id: [0x00989B17]
!*Nothing here. Why is it always me sent into dread and shadow?

Id: [0x00989B19]
!*Yes, sir.

Id: [0x00989B30]
!*We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B32]
!*[Laughs]It's not the first time, Kenway. And it won't be the last.

Id: [0x00989B35]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B3E]
!*We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B40]
!*[Laughs] That just makes it a fair fight.

Id: [0x00989B43]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B4C]
!*We're outnumbered, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B4E]
!*[Laughs]Wouldn't want it any other way.

Id: [0x00989B51]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B5B]
!*How do you like our chances, mate?

Id: [0x00989B5D]
!*[Laughs]I'd say they find themselves outnumbered.

Id: [0x00989B60]
!*Take no Quarter, Lads! And give none neither!

Id: [0x00989B67]
!*Stop him!

Id: [0x00989B68]
!*Do something, you fools!

Id: [0x00989B69]
!*Somebody shoot him!

Id: [0x00989B6A]
!*Help!

Id: [0x00989B6B]
!*Kill him! Kill him!

Id: [0x00989B6C]
!*Carry on!

Id: [0x00989B6F]
!*What was that?

Id: [0x00989B70]
!*I don't know, but let's not find out.

Id: [0x00989B72]
!*Did you hear that Noise?

Id: [0x00989B73]
!*It's just the Trees creaking.

Id: [0x00989B74]
!*Or Something making them creek...

Id: [0x00989B77]
!*We cannot pass them undetected, Captain. And there is no other Way.

Id: [0x00989B7A]
!*They're getting away, Captain.

Id: [0x00989B7C]
!*What was that? Did you hear it?

Id: [0x00989B7D]
!*Huh?! What the devil was that?

Id: [0x00989B7E]
!*There are some mighty strange Noises in this Swamp.

Id: [0x00989B80]
!*Bloody Idiot.

Id: [0x00989B83]
!*I'm trying! I'm trying!

Id: [0x00989B86]
!*I don't want to die here!

Id: [0x00989B87]
!*We'll be there any second now. Don't worry.

Id: [0x00989B8A]
!*Close the Gate!

Id: [0x00989B8C]
!*What the hell?!

Id: [0x00989B8D]
!*Hey!

Id: [0x00989B8E]
!*[Startled shout]

Id: [0x00989B90]
!*Thank Christ! I thought we'd never make it.

Id: [0x00989B93]
!*Ryder! I was starting to think you'd got lost.

Id: [0x00989B94]
!*No such Luck, Mate.

Id: [0x00989B95]
!*Well, keep a Watch for Crocodiles up ahead. Swamp's full of the Buggers.

Id: [0x00989B96]
!*What? Does he jest?

Id: [0x00989B99]
!*I'll be back with the Medicines.

Id: [0x00989B9A]
!*Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989BA3]
Ready the whaleboat!

Id: [0x00989BA4]
Unlash the harpoons.

Id: [0x00989BA5]
Let's go hunting.

Id: [0x00989BA9]
There he is!

Id: [0x00989BAA]
I see him!

Id: [0x00989BAB]
There's our prey.

Id: [0x00989BAC]
He's over there!

Id: [0x00989BAD]
There he goes.

Id: [0x00989BAE]
It's there!

Id: [0x00989BAF]
Ready, men!

Id: [0x00989BB0]
Let's get started.

Id: [0x00989BB4]
Damn!

Id: [0x00989BB5]
Back to the ship, men.

Id: [0x00989BB9]
He'll be ours another day, captain.

Id: [0x00989BBA]
It was a stroke of bad luck, sir.

Id: [0x00989BBB]
That devil won't escape us next time.

Id: [0x00989BBE]
{10001342}{10001342}{10001342}!*Hey! Oh, oh! My friend! Hey, I like that too! He, he! We have got it. Hey!

Id: [0x00989BC0]
Careful with that horn!

{10001346}{10001346}{10001346}!*They caught a hammer!

Id: [0x00989BC4]
What a beast!

Id: [0x00989BC6]
Look at the size of that monster!

Id: [0x00989BC8]
Whale ho!

Id: [0x00989BCA]
It's the White Whale!

Id: [0x00989BCD]
A fine catch, Cap'n!

Id: [0x00989BCE]
A great haul, Sir.

Id: [0x00989BCF]
Well done, Captain.

Id: [0x00989BDB]
!*We should avoid those patrol boats, captain.

Id: [0x00989BDC]
!*Patrol boat, sir. We should plot a new course.

Id: [0x00989BDD]
!*Another boat. Let's stay out of their way.

Id: [0x00989BE7]
!*Ready...

Id: [0x00989BE8]
!*Fire!

Id: [0x00989BE9]
!*Take Aim... Fire!

Id: [0x00989BEB]
!*Steady your Aim, Man!

Id: [0x00989BEC]
!*Thank your Stars these Targets don't shoot back.

Id: [0x00989BED]
!*Grant, you Fool! Try opening your bloody Eyes!

Id: [0x00989BEE]
!*Stand strong! Don't let the Rifle push you around.

Id: [0x00989BEF]
!*Miss a Shot out there and you'll be worm Meat. Think on that!

Id: [0x00989BF3]
!*Don't drop it now! It's worth more than your Life.

Id: [0x00989BF4]
!*Move it, Lads!

Id: [0x00989BF5]
!*Faster! Come on! We don't have all Day.

Id: [0x00989BF6]
!*Put your Back into it, you Ninnies!

Id: [0x00989BF7]
!*Steady with that one, Jones. You'll blow us all up!

Id: [0x00989BFB]
!*Never conceived I'd end up in a Place like this. I set off from Dublin a young Lad, ready to die for my family.

Id: [0x00989BFC]
!*I'd rather die for Silver.  He makes for a grander Funeral.

Id: [0x00989C00]
!*You been smoking again? You'll blow us all skyward, you daft Bugger.

Id: [0x00989C01]
!*Ah... Keep yer Breeches on, Gravesy. I know my Way around Gunpowder. Been handling it all my Life, haven't I?

Id: [0x00989C02]
!*Aye, well maybe it's blighted your Senses. I've seen better Men than you set off a Barrel. One Flicker of scorched Tobacco and you're nought but Jetsam.

Id: [0x00989C08]
!*I'm gonna pull that Tongue right out of your Skull!

Id: [0x00989C09]
!*You and how many Whoresons?

Id: [0x00989C0A]
!*Come here, Swine! I demand an Apology!

Id: [0x00989C0B]
!*And I'll ask your Mother for one!

Id: [0x00989C0C]
!*Leave my Mother out of this or I swear I'll kill you twice-over.

Id: [0x00989C0D]
!*Oh yeah?

Id: [0x00989C0E]
!*Yeah!

Id: [0x00989C11]
!*I say we sneak in just before Dawn, same as last time, stash away as much Rum as we can while the Captain's snoring off another Skinful.

Id: [0x00989C12]
!*Bastard's downed half our Hoard already. There'll be nothing left to take back Home.

Id: [0x00989C13]
!*Then we'll find some more. The whole Ocean's carrying Rum. And I aim to get my Share.

Id: [0x00989C14]
!*Just before Dawn then. If we don't die of Thirst beforehand.

Id: [0x00989C18]
!*Pissing away my Life in this bloody Cave. As if anyone's going to find us.

Id: [0x00989C19]
!*Walk back and forth, back and forth, staring at these damned Walls.

Id: [0x00989C1A]
!*Oh look, nobody there. Again. What a Surprise. Wish someone did appear. Put me out of my Misery.

Id: [0x00989C1E]
!*They must have left in one Hell of a Hurry. Look at all this.

Id: [0x00989C1F]
!*The cowards probably saw a Ship approach and fled. Can't be much of any worth left... When none that ain't touched by a Rot.

Id: [0x00989C20]
!*Don't be so sure, Mate. Alfred just came across three Barrels of fine Rum.

Id: [0x00989C21]
!*I think we just found a new Home.

Id: [0x00989C24]
!*Oy! Can anyone hear me? Hello?

Id: [0x00989C25]
!*This Place is a bloody Death Trap. I can't get out.

Id: [0x00989C26]
!*Hello? Come on! Get me out of here!

Id: [0x00989C29]
!*Shit. Another rotten one. Nothing.

Id: [0x00989C2A]
!*Keep searching! We don't want to leave anything valuable behind.

Id: [0x00989C2B]
!*And watch out for Gunpowder when you go poking around.

Id: [0x00989C2E]
!*What you think happened here?

Id: [0x00989C2F]
!*I don't know, but it's been abandoned for some time. They're not coming back.

Id: [0x00989C30]
!*Maybe they didn't want to. Maybe this Place is, you know...

Id: [0x00989C31]
!*What?

Id: [0x00989C32]
!*Haunted.

Id: [0x00989C33]
!*[Snorts derisively] It's famished Rats you have to fear, not Ghosts.

Id: [0x00989C34]
!*I don't know. I can feel their Presence. Like they're watching us.

Id: [0x00989C35]
!*Of course they are. And they're going to jump out of the Shadows any moment now and carry you off to Hell.

Id: [0x00989C39]
!*Did you ever lay Eyes on a more sinister Sight? Bones everywhere. And those Paintings...

Id: [0x00989C3A]
!*Aye, it goes against all Decency and Nature alright. They say these Mayans would rip the beating Heart right out of a Man's Chest.

Id: [0x00989C3B]
!*We've no place being here, if you ask me.

Id: [0x00989C3C]
!*Captain Walters supposes it thick with hidden Treasures.

Id: [0x00989C3D]
!*Let us pray that's all it's thick with.

Id: [0x00989C40]
!*Be quick about it, Harris. The Tide'll be upon us soon.

Id: [0x00989C41]
!*I can't find anything, Sir. There's nothing here to open that Door.

Id: [0x00989C42]
!*It's there, and by God you're going to find it, even if you're up to your Neck in Brine.

Id: [0x00989C43]
!*Couldn't we just blow it open with some powder Barrels, sir?

Id: [0x00989C44]
!*Aye, and bring the whole damned Temple down on our Heads. Find it!

Id: [0x00989C45]
!*Yes, Sir.

Id: [0x00989C48]
!*It's bad Luck this. We're desecrating a holy Place.

Id: [0x00989C49]
!*Everything's bad Luck to you. You spent a Month below Deck last time we spied an Albatross. Besides, there's nothing holy about Mayans. Uncivilized Heathens, the lot of 'em.

Id: [0x00989C4A]
!*Heathens or not, we're courting Misfortune. Can't you feel the Dread seeping from these Rocks?

Id: [0x00989C4B]
!*I feel the Dread of listening to your bloody Gibbering for the rest of my Days.

Id: [0x00989C4F]
!*Didn't I tell ya to heave out these bloody Corpses?

Id: [0x00989C50]
!*Aye, sir. But the Smell makes it strenuous work. Some of the Lads had to stop to purge themselves.

Id: [0x00989C51]
!*Get them out by Day's end or there'll be fresh Bodies fouling up the Air.

Id: [0x00989C52]
!*Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989C55]
!*You fancy joining your Pal down in the Drink there? [laughs]

Id: [0x00989C56]
!*No! Please, I don't know anything!

Id: [0x00989C57]
!*Sure ya do. Where do you keep the Gold, ya filthy Cur?

Id: [0x00989C58]
!*I swear! We just mine the Stuff. Please! Don't kill me!

Id: [0x00989C59]
!*Bah!

Id: [0x00989C5C]
!*Mighty convenient, don't ya think? Flood kills everyone, leaves the Gold free for us to find...

Id: [0x00989C5D]
!*Won't get no Complaints from me. Scavenging's as honest a Profession as any.

Id: [0x00989C5E]
!*Aye, easiest Spoils we ever seized. Assuming we can find the bloody Stuff.

Id: [0x00989C5F]
!*Don't worry. Captain won't be leaving till we've found every damned Nugget.

Id: [0x00989C63]
!*Intruder!

Id: [0x00989C64]
!*Defend the cave!

Id: [0x00989C65]
!*We're under attack!

Id: [0x00989C66]
!*Kill him!

Id: [0x00989C67]
!*Intruder alert!

Id: [0x00989C68]
!*Find him!

Id: [0x00989C69]
!*Intruder!

Id: [0x00989C6A]
!*Shoot to kill!

Id: [0x00989C6B]
!*Where is he!?

Id: [0x00989C6C]
!*Don't let him our alive!

Id: [0x00989C6D]
!*We have an intruder!

Id: [0x00989C6E]
!*Somebody shoot him!

Id: [0x00989C6F]
!*We have an intruder!

Id: [0x00989C70]
!*I want him dead!

Id: [0x00989C80]
!*That Ship wanders a little too close to the Fort, don't you agree, Captain?

Id: [0x00989C82]
!*The Tower has her in his sights. She won't last long in the water.

Id: [0x00989C84]
!*Mortar incoming! We must keep moving!

Id: [0x00989C86]
!*We cannot hit the Mortar from here, Captain. We should aim for the towers!

Id: [0x00989C88]
!*Aim for the Towers, Captain!

Id: [0x00989C8A]
!*We can't take much more damage, Captain! We should brace when we're under fire!

Id: [0x00989C8C]
!*We should get closer, Captain. Finish the job.

Id: [0x00989C8E]
!*Wait here. I'll fare better alone.

Id: [0x00989C91]
!*Hello? Is anyone up there?

Id: [0x00989C92]
!*Come on down. It's my Rat's birthday Party!

Id: [0x00989C93]
!*Anyone there? I've discovered the Means to end all Wars, but I'm not telling you. [giggles]

Id: [0x00989C94]
!*It's all right! I'm perfectly comfortable down here. I have some delicious Tea.

Id: [0x00989C95]
!*It's a lovely Day, isn't it?

Id: [0x00989C96]
!*Would you kindly tell the Duke to cancel his Ball? All that dancing makes a terrible Noise.

Id: [0x00989C99]
!*Hey, What's that in the Fog? It looks like a Ship!

Id: [0x00989C9A]
!*I've heard of such a Vessel, Captain, stalking its Prey is the ocean Mists. The HMS Prince.

Id: [0x00989C9B]
!*And you believe it intends to hunt us next?

Id: [0x00989C9C]
!*If it is the Prince, she will not rest until she has destroyed us.

Id: [0x00989C9D]
!*Or we have destroyed her.

Id: [0x00989CA0]
!*She looks like a Ghost Ship!

Id: [0x00989CA1]
!*Aye, risen from the Dead to sink us!

Id: [0x00989CA2]
!*Be careful, Captain. She will use the fog to her Advantage.

Id: [0x00989CA4]
!*I tire of this. If only the Wind would disperse this damned Fog!

Id: [0x00989CA5]
!*The HMS Prince has an uncanny Ability to seek out such Conditions. She strikes Terror into the  Hearts of most Mariners.

Id: [0x00989CA6]
!*Perhaps, but it's still a cowardly tactic.

Id: [0x00989CA7]
!*And a most effective one.

Id: [0x00989CAB]
!*[cheers]She's done for!

Id: [0x00989CAC]
!*Let her hide in the Depths of the Sea. Her Captain should have displayed more Courage.

Id: [0x00989CAD]
!*He lived the life of a Ghost. He belongs to the Mist now.

Id: [0x00989CAE]
!*He belongs to all Creatures who scavenge beneath the Waves. They will feast today.

Id: [0x00989CD6]
!*Looks like they're working together.

Id: [0x00989CD7]
!*Doing so is almost an Obsession for them. We should be careful, Captain.

Id: [0x00989CDA]
!*Two Man-o-wars, Captain!

Id: [0x00989CDB]
!*Aye, Captain, they always do. The HMS Sovereign and the HMS Conquest, captained by Siblings.

Id: [0x00989CDC]
!*The Brothers-in-Arms. I know of them. They've sunk many a Pirate.

Id: [0x00989CDF]
!*They're heading straight for us!

Id: [0x00989CE0]
!*We're outnumbered!

Id: [0x00989CE1]
!*They're fast and know no Fear, Captain. This will be no easy Battle.

Id: [0x00989CE2]
!*Perhaps they ought to be reunited at the bottom of the Sea.

Id: [0x00989CE5]
!*What do you know about these Brothers, Adé?

Id: [0x00989CE6]
!*Their Father's Vessel was sunk by Pirates many Years ago.

Id: [0x00989CE7]
!*And now they seek Revenge on all who hoist the Black Flag.

Id: [0x00989CE8]
!*Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989CEB]
!*We did it! They're both gone!

Id: [0x00989CEC]
!*Vengeance is a Noble motive, but Rage made them too wild.

Id: [0x00989CED]
!*Theirs was a doomed Family. They were destined to end this Way.

Id: [0x00989CEE]
!*And ours was the Hand that sealed that Fate.

Id: [0x00989CEF]
!*She's set herself on Fire!

Id: [0x00989CF0]
!*What?!

Id: [0x00989CF1]
!*She's charging at us!

Id: [0x00989CF2]
!*She intends to take us down with her!

Id: [0x00989CF3]
!*Veer off, Captain! Veer off!

Id: [0x00989CF4]
!*Change Course, Sir! We must get out of her Way!

Id: [0x00989CF5]
!*She will burn out if we can avoid her Charges long enough!

Id: [0x00989CF8]
!*The Captain must have lost his Mind!

Id: [0x00989CF9]
!*Grief took his Mind long ago!

Id: [0x00989CFC]
!*Ship ho! Look at the size of her!

Id: [0x00989CFD]
!*The Weapons, the black Hull... It can only be La Dama Negra.

Id: [0x00989CFE]
!*What do you know of her?

Id: [0x00989CFF]
!*She's a floating Fortress, Captain. Very likely the most heavily armored Ship on the Ocean, with over a hundred Cannons.

Id: [0x00989D00]
!*But I wager she's slow in the Water.

Id: [0x00989D01]
!*Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989D04]
!*She's sinking fast! We did it!

Id: [0x00989D05]
!*The mightiest Vessel ever constructed, and we sent her down to the ocean Floor.

Id: [0x00989D06]
!*Let the History Books reflect on that. And let them speak of a far nobler Ship: the Jackdaw.

Id: [0x00989D07]
!*They will, Captain. I am sure of it.

Id: [0x00989D0A]
!*She may look impressive, but Castles belong on Land. A foolish Endeavor.

Id: [0x00989D0B]
!*La Dama Negra was meant to turn the Tide of War in Spain's favor, but she was completed too late for that.

Id: [0x00989D0C]
!*We shouldn't underestimate her Defenses, sir. Or her Firepower.

Id: [0x00989D0D]
!*The heavier she is, the faster she'll go down.

Id: [0x00989D10]
!*You seen the Armor on her? We'll never make a dent in that Thing!

Id: [0x00989D11]
!*She's flying a Spanish Flag! Won't take too kindly to Pirates!

Id: [0x00989D12]
!*We must find where her Armor is at its lightest, Captain!

Id: [0x00989D15]
!*Ship sighted! Oh... She's a Beast!

Id: [0x00989D16]
!*Have you ever seen anything like it?

Id: [0x00989D17]
!*Few who have seen it survive, Captain. She's The Impoluto. Captained by a Spanish Madman, they say.

Id: [0x00989D18]
!*His Name is Don Pasamonte, and he is less a Pirate than a Curse upon the Ocean. He attacks every Vessel he sees. Be careful, captain.

Id: [0x00989D1B]
!*What's she doing?

Id: [0x00989D1C]
!*She's coming straight at us!

Id: [0x00989D1D]
!*Beat to Quarters, lads!

Id: [0x00989D20]
!*Yeaaahhh! She's sunk!

Id: [0x00989D21]
!*We have done a great Thing, Sir. The Impoluto has been the Ruin of too many Vessels.

Id: [0x00989D22]
!*They say Pasamonte lost his Mind during the War. Perhaps he can find Peace now.

Id: [0x00989D23]
!*He can find Peace in Hell. Let him and his Ship rot there.

Id: [0x00989D26]
!*She behaves like a wild Animal!

Id: [0x00989D27]
!*Pasamonte is as feared as Blackbeard in these Parts. To many he is the Devil, and the Impoluto is a Hell-ship.

Id: [0x00989D28]
!*What manner of Crew would work under such a Man?

Id: [0x00989D29]
!*One accustomed to Madness, captain.

Id: [0x00989D2C]
It's the White Whale!

Id: [0x00989D2D]
There she blows! The White Whale!

Id: [0x00989D32]
!*Over here!

Id: [0x00989D33]
!*Need some Work?

Id: [0x00989D34]
!*I have a Proposition!

Id: [0x00989D35]
!*How would you like a privateering Contract?

Id: [0x00989D36]
!*My employer has a substantial Reward if you can help.

Id: [0x00989D37]
!*You look like you could handle a delicate Job.

Id: [0x00989D38]
!*My boss is looking for a Privateer.

Id: [0x00989D39]
!*Would you be interested in some privateering Work?

Id: [0x00989D3A]
!*I think you'll find this Job rather interesting.

Id: [0x00989D40]
!*What the Devil is that?!

Id: [0x00989D41]
!*Waterspout!

Id: [0x00989D42]
!*It's headed straight for us!

Id: [0x00989D43]
!*Take cover!

Id: [0x00989D46]
!*Our merchant Friend has earned himself some serious Enemies.

Id: [0x00989D47]
!*Aye, Captain. They seem rather committed to his Capture.

Id: [0x00989D48]
!*Christ! This Reward had better be worth it.

Id: [0x00989D4B]
!*I'm not sure the Jackdaw can handle such a challenge right now, Captain. Perhaps we should turn back.

Id: [0x00989D4C]
!*We may not yet be ready for such an encounter, Captain.

Id: [0x00989D4D]
!*The Jackdaw is a fine ship, but she may not be prepared for such an enemy.

Id: [0x00989D4E]
!*Aye, and in Something of a Hurry. I propose we follow... else they spring Something we ain't ready for.

Id: [0x00989D51]
!*There's Movement up ahead. Is it Soldiers?

Id: [0x00989D90]
!*We cannot pass them undetected, Captain. And there is no other Way.

Id: [0x00989D91]
!*There's always another Way.

Id: [0x00989D92]
!*All stop.

Id: [0x00989D94]
!*I'll be back with the Medicines.

Id: [0x00989D95]
!*Aye, Sir.

Id: [0x00989D97]
!*They're getting away, Captain.

Id: [0x00989DF8]
!*Is it over yet?

Id: [0x00989DF9]
!*Isn't anybody going to help me?

Id: [0x00989DFA]
!*They're just going to leave us here, aren't they?

Id: [0x00989DFB]
!*Help!

Id: [0x00989DFF]
!*What's your thinking?

Id: [0x00989E00]
!*Blackbeard's been at this eight Days already, so it's a good Bet someone out there has prepared the Medicines, just in Case.

Id: [0x00989E03]
!*Aye. So let's find where they've gathered and hope for the Best.

Id: [0x00989E06]
!*Careful, Captain. We're drifting close to a Watchtower.

Id: [0x00989E07]
!*Them Watchtower's might spot us. Best keep out of Sight.

Id: [0x00989E08]
!*There's another Watchtower.

Id: [0x00989E0A]
!*We should avoid those Patrols, Captain.

Id: [0x00989E0B]
!*Patrols, just there. We should plot a new Course.

Id: [0x00989E0C]
!*Another patrol Ship. Steer clear of 'em.

Id: [0x00989E0E]
!*Keep her at Half-Sail, Captain. Speed'll do us no Favors here.

Id: [0x00989E10]
!*Slow down, Captain. Let them pass by.

Id: [0x00989E13]
!*Careful with the Banks.

Id: [0x00989E14]
!*Let us hope the River remains this wide.

Id: [0x00989E15]
!*Be sure they don't Spy us trailing them.

Id: [0x00989E16]
!*Steady as she goes, Captain.

Id: [0x00989E17]
!*I see them. Over there.

Id: [0x00989E18]
!*If we run aground here, we may never get out.

Id: [0x00989E1C]
!*Who goes there?!

Id: [0x00989E1D]
!*Calm down, Clark, it's only us.

Id: [0x00989E20]
!*Identify yourself!

Id: [0x00989E21]
!*Privates Ryder and Thomas.

Id: [0x00989E24]
!*What's that? Someone there?

Id: [0x00989E25]
!*It's us. We're reporting to the Captain.

Id: [0x00989E26]
!*Carry on!

Id: [0x00989E29]
!*Ryder! I was starting to think you'd got lost.

Id: [0x00989E2A]
!*No such Luck, Mate.

Id: [0x00989E2B]
!*Well, keep a Watch for Crocodiles up ahead. Swamp's full of the Buggers.

Id: [0x00989E2C]
!*What? Does he jest?

Id: [0x00989E30]
!*What was that?

Id: [0x00989E31]
!*I don't know, but let's not find out.

Id: [0x00989E33]
!*Did you hear that Noise?

Id: [0x00989E34]
!*It's just the Trees creaking.

Id: [0x00989E35]
!*Or Something making them creak...

Id: [0x00989E3B]
!*If Heat or the Reptiles don't finish us, it'll be these damnable Insects.

Id: [0x00989E3C]
!*Aye, the Mosquitoes'll sup every last ounce of Vitality from us.

Id: [0x00989E3F]
!*You think it's true what they say about Blackbeard? That Fire strikes out from his Head? As if from some Volcano?

Id: [0x00989E40]
!*If he's not the Devil himself, then surely he's made some Pact with Hell. Only be thankful his Ship remains anchored, and hasn't torn a Path into the Heart of Charles-Towne.

Id: [0x00989E41]
!*Bloody Pirates. Someone ought to do something.

Id: [0x00989E42]
!*They'll be hunted down eventually. Every last One of them.

Id: [0x00989E45]
!*Who's that there?

Id: [0x00989E46]
!*Two old 'Gators come for their Supper.

Id: [0x00989E47]
!*Ryder, me old Mucker. Bit warm tonight, ain't it?

Id: [0x00989E48]
!*We'll talk about the Weather another Time, Mate. Bit of a hurry.

Id: [0x00989E4A]
!*This Blockade best end soon. I'm going land-crazy, and this dirty Puddle won't do.

Id: [0x00989E4B]
!*One would suppose all this was for Gold. Or Rum at least.

Id: [0x00989E4C]
!*Nothing but Medicines to cure whatever Ailments fester aboard their Vessels.

Id: [0x00989E4D]
!*Syphilis and Scurvy, no doubt. What noxious Coffins these Pirate ships must be.

Id: [0x00989E50]
!*What was that?! It was a Crocodile, wasn't it? It's coming straight for us, I can feel it.

Id: [0x00989E53]
!*You seen any Crocodiles tonight? I could've sworn I saw something pass the Boat.

Id: [0x00989E54]
!*Nope, quiet Night.

Id: [0x00989E55]
!*Are you sure? I heard something in the Water.

Id: [0x00989E56]
!*Quiet 'til you showed up. Go on then. Captain's waiting.

Id: [0x00989E59]
!*Almost there.

Id: [0x00989E5A]
!*Good. Captain Wyatt is not a patient Man.

Id: [0x00989E5C]
!*Hullo! Is that Ryder yonder?

Id: [0x00989E5D]
!*The very same.

Id: [0x00989E5E]
!*Then speed along. You're expected. And you know how--

Id: [0x00989E60]
!*[screams - killed by crocodile]

Id: [0x00989E61]
!*Oh Christ!

Id: [0x00989E62]
!*It took him! It took him! I told you!

Id: [0x00989E63]
!*Just row, for godsakes! Row!

Id: [0x00989E66]
!*I told you there was something! Didn't I tell you? Oh god...

Id: [0x00989E67]
!*Let's just get out of here.

Id: [0x00989E6A]
!*Can't you make this thing go any faster?

Id: [0x00989E6B]
!*I'm trying! I'm trying!

Id: [0x00989E6D]
!*Is it after us? Can you see it?

Id: [0x00989E6E]
!*Don't think about it. Just row. Row!

Id: [0x00989E70]
!*I don't want to die here!

Id: [0x00989E71]
!*We'll be there any Second now. Don't worry.

Id: [0x00989E74]
!*Thank Christ! I thought we'd never make it.

Id: [0x00989E76]
!*Private Ryder reporting, sir.

Id: [0x00989E77]
!*And doing so with great Delay.

Id: [0x00989E78]
!*I apologize, sir. There was an Accident. Private Simon-- this Crocodile--

Id: [0x00989E79]
!*I don't care about your Accidents. What's the Word from the Harbor, Soldier? Speak!

Id: [0x00989E7A]
!*No change, sir. They're holding fast but are yet to kill or maim any of the Captives, near as we can tell. Perhaps it's Time to--

Id: [0x00989E7B]
!*To surrender? I've been entrusted with the Affairs of the Town, and I do not intend to bow to the Demands of a Pirate, no matter how fierce his Reputation.

Id: [0x00989E7C]
!*Yes, Sir.

Id: [0x00989E7D]
!*As long as the supply Key is with me, no Man shall touch that Medicine. May Plague and Calamity strike them all.

Id: [0x00989E80]
!*Bloody Idiot.

Id: [0x00989E83]
!*What?!

Id: [0x00989E84]
!*Intruder! Help!

Id: [0x00989E86]
!*Stop him!

Id: [0x00989E87]
!*Do something, you Fools!

Id: [0x00989E88]
!*Somebody shoot him!

Id: [0x00989E89]
!*Help!

Id: [0x00989E8A]
!*Kill him! Kill him!

Id: [0x00989E8D]
!*Someone's after the Captain!

Id: [0x00989E8E]
!*What's going on?!

Id: [0x00989E8F]
!*Hey! Stop!

Id: [0x00989E90]
!*There's an Intruder! Get 'im!

Id: [0x00989E91]
!*Do something!

Id: [0x00989E92]
!*He's going for the Captain!

Id: [0x00989E93]
!*Careful with the Gunpowder Barrels!

Id: [0x00989E94]
!*Don't hit the Gunpowder!

Id: [0x00989E96]
!*What the Hell?!

Id: [0x00989E97]
!*Hey!

Id: [0x00989E98]
!*[Startled shout]

Id: [0x00989E9B]
!*Close the Gate!

Id: [0x00989E9C]
!*Good.

Id: [0x00989E9D]
!*Stay here. Shoot anything that moves.

Id: [0x00989E9E]
!*Come on. It's time.

Id: [0x00989E9F]
!*Tell me about the beach.

Id: [0x00989EA0]
!*A fair gathering, sir. Most too drunk to stand.

Id: [0x00989EA1]
!*That will suit our purpose.

Id: [0x00989EA3]
!*I thought for a moment I'd die there. Those bloody savages.

Id: [0x00989EA4]
!*Have no fear, soldier. This will be the end of them.

Id: [0x00989EA7]
!*What?!

Id: [0x00989EA8]
!*Get him!

Id: [0x00989EC1]
!*Stations, lads!

Id: [0x00989EC2]
!*Today you fight for your lives! And for your freedom!

Id: [0x00989EC3]
!*We'll teach them to fear the black flag!

Id: [0x00989EC5]
!*Mortar!

Id: [0x00989EC7]
!*Captain! Broadside!

Id: [0x00989EC9]
!*She's heading right for us, captain!

Id: [0x00989ECA]
!*Brace!

Id: [0x00989ECC]
!*Board!

Id: [0x00989ED1]
!*[Pain grunt]

Id: [0x00989ED4]
!*[Laugh]Wide of the Mark, Kenway.

Id: [0x00989ED8]
!*Maybe he remembers where his Rat is hiding before my Aim markedly improves.

Id: [0x00989EDD]
!*[To himself]That flushed him out.[to Thatch] I'll catch you up, Thatch.

Id: [0x00989F05]
!*She's ready to be boarded!

Id: [0x00989F06]
!*Brace! Braaaaace!

Id: [0x01312D20]
Barry.<br>

Id: [0x01312D21]
You've been ill for weeks.

Id: [0x01312D22]
What do you all want?

Id: [0x01312DDF]
What the hell did you do?[beat] It’s... some kind of dormant virus...

Id: [0x01312DE0]
Shit! Hang on, I’m getting you out of there!

Id: [0x01312DE9]
{20000233}{20000233}{20000233}Sorry for the rough exit.

Id: [0x01312DEB]
{20000235}{20000235}{20000235}Your earpiece is still working?

Id: [0x01312DEC]
{20000236}{20000236}{20000236}Hey! Are you with me? Focus on my voice!

Id: [0x01312DEF]
{20000239}{20000239}{20000239}Good! Don’t forget your communicator. Check it if you get lost!

Id: [0x01312DF1]
{20000241}{20000241}{20000241}We need to get out of here and fast!

Id: [0x01312DF5]
Follow me. Double time!

Id: [0x01312DF7]
This chaos is absolutely your fault, in case you were wondering.

Id: [0x01312DF9]
HOLY FUCKBALLS! Whatever is doing this got out when you accessed that genetic memory. It’s in every system!

Id: [0x01312DFB]
Hurry! We gotta get out of here!

Id: [0x01312DFC]
What's wrong with you? Come on!

Id: [0x01312DFD]
Hey, numbskull, don’t wander off!

Id: [0x01312DFE]
Come with me if you want to live!

Id: [0x01312E06]
Come on, everyone! Just like we practiced in our safety drills!

Id: [0x01312E07]
Everything is going to be okay, guys! Stay positive!

Id: [0x01312E08]
I don’t know how this building ever got approved with no stairs and only one elevator!

Id: [0x01312E10]
What the hell is happening?

Id: [0x01312E11]
A file labeled “Shay Cormac” was booby-trapped with some kind of virus.

Id: [0x01312E13]
Your job is to prevent things like this!

Id: [0x01312E14]
We need to contain these genetic memories. Then we can destroy them.

Id: [0x01312E16]
No. Isolate them. I want to study these memories.

Id: [0x01312E17]
But--

Id: [0x01312E18]
With respect, Ms. Lemay, this is not a request.

Id: [0x01312E19]
You heard the man.

Id: [0x01312E1B]
Fine.

Id: [0x01312E1D]
I need to borrow your numbskull. That okay with you, “Ms. Lemay"?

Id: [0x01312E1F]
Hey there. This might seem a bit weird, but you’re going to work for...

Id: [0x01312E21]
...contractors we hired to, you know, upgrade our security. Mr. Otso Berg and Ms. Violet da Costa.

Id: [0x01312E22]
Call me Violet.

Id: [0x01312E24]
I have to go check on our people and prepare a statement for the press.

Id: [0x01312E26]
Do whatever they tell you to do, okay? Go team!

Id: [0x01312E2C]
{20000300}{20000300}{20000300}Here’s how it is: You made this mess, you’re going to help me clean it up. You belong to me now.

Id: [0x01312E2E]
{20000302}{20000302}{20000302}We’ll have to reboot the servers in the basement to get Helix going again.

Id: [0x01312E30]
Man, whoever designed this virus is a genius. Not only does it restrict our access to the Cloud, it’s adapted to fuck up the other operating systems that regulate building functions!

Id: [0x01312E32]
Melanie, the elevators are out of commission. Are we stuck on this floor?

Id: [0x01312E33]
Damn. Yes. I’ll get repair crews onsite ASAP.

Id: [0x01312E34]
There’s a working area server on this floor. I guess it will have to do for now.

Id: [0x01312E3A]
{20000314}{20000314}{20000314}Is it my paranoid imagination, or is that camera following me?

Id: [0x01312E3C]
{20000316}{20000316}{20000316}Yeah! Whoever’s behind that camera is not interested in you.

Id: [0x01312E3E]
{20000318}{20000318}{20000318}I’m marking the security office on your map.[beat] Can you patch me into their feed? Let’s see what they’re looking at.

Id: [0x01312E45]
{20000325}{20000325}{20000325}Hey, did you forget about our peeping toms?

Id: [0x01312E46]
{20000326}{20000326}{20000326}I know you’ve been through a lot, but I’m not finished with you.

Id: [0x01312E47]
{20000327}{20000327}{20000327}Back on track, numbskull. Security office. Now.

Id: [0x01312E49]
{20000329}{20000329}{20000329}Do you see a flashing wireless signal? Great, that means you can still access systems. Go ahead and patch me into their feed.

Id: [0x01312E4B]
{20000331}{20000331}{20000331}Aha. Thought as much. There’s an emitter controlling this camera. I bet it’s not the only one either.

Id: [0x01312E4D]
{20000333}{20000333}{20000333}Okay. I killed the feed. One problem solved. Now, back to work.

Id: [0x01312E4E]
{20000334}{20000334}{20000334}Status update.

Id: [0x01312E4F]
{20000335}{20000335}{20000335}Hey, boss. We had to take a minor detour to deal with security cameras. I think we’re being watched.

Id: [0x01312E50]
{20000336}{20000336}{20000336}A sensible precaution, but I am eager to study Shay Cormac’s memories further.

Id: [0x01312E51]
Why? He’s just a nobody as far as I can tell.

Id: [0x01312E52]
If Shay Cormac is who I suspect he is, then this temporary setback may provide us with an unexpected reward.

Id: [0x01312E54]
Proceed to the server room on this floor.

Id: [0x01312E56]
Come on, numbskull!

Id: [0x01312E57]
{20000343}{20000343}{20000343}Listen, I can forgive you for being a fuck up, but my boss?[Laugh] Not so much...

Id: [0x01312E58]
I have dogs at home that are better trained than you are.

Id: [0x01312E5A]
{20000346}{20000346}{20000346}Okay. There’s probably a failsafe we need to get past. Listen closely, and do exactly as I tell you.

Id: [0x01312E5C]
{20000348}{20000348}{20000348}The server is unresponsive so let’s bring it back to life, shall we?

Id: [0x01312E5F]
Um. Okay, so, I’m not sure you were supposed to see that. Just, ah, you should just get back to your Animus.

Id: [0x01312E63]
Hey, one of your coworkers dropped his communicator by the elevator. If you see any tech lying around like that, grab ‘em. There might be a clue as to who did this.

Id: [0x01312E65]
Nice find. If it was me, I’d snoop to see if there was any juicy stuff on it. But I might be a terrible person...

Id: [0x01312E67]
Listen, you do not want to be on Berg’s shit list. Trust me.

Id: [0x01312E68]
Can you please get back to your Animus? If you get me in trouble with Berg I will throw you out the fucking window.

Id: [0x01312E69]
What Berg wants, Berg gets, and Berg wants you back in the Animus. Double time!

Id: [0x01312E73]
Shay couldn’t have died then appeared in France twenty years later. We’re missing something.

Id: [0x01312E78]
Shay’s memories are scattered in chunks throughout the Cloud, the servers are messed up from the virus, so we can’t access all of Shay’s life at once.

Id: [0x01312E7A]
You’ve hit a wall and I’m busy with something. Why don’t you go meet Otso Berg. You’ll find him squatting in one of the offices.

Id: [0x01312E7C]
Berg’s kind of likes it when people are on time, you know?

Id: [0x01312E7D]
I wouldn't make Berg wait if I were you.

Id: [0x01312E7E]
You want to make a good first impression on someone like Berg? I’d see him sooner, not later.

Id: [0x01312E83]
Shay Cormac is an Assassin... but he is unlike the ones you have used for your entertainment products in the past.

Id: [0x01312E85]
I believe Shay may be the most important Assassin who ever lived.

Id: [0x01312E87]
Your research will help me achieve something I have wanted for a very long time.

Id: [0x01312E89]
Shay’s story may have something to offer you as well...

Id: [0x01312E8E]
I want you to study this board as if your life depended on it.

Id: [0x01312E8F]
I know what I see when I look at the board. I wonder what you see.

Id: [0x01312E91]
{20000401}{20000401}{20000401}Sorry to interrupt the new bromance.

Id: [0x01312E92]
{20000402}{20000402}{20000402}Speak.

Id: [0x01312E93]
There’s another server we can access to get the next chunk of Shay’s memories.

Id: [0x01312E94]
Excellent.

Id: [0x01312E95]
I’m going to need the numbskull back if we’re going to proceed.

Id: [0x01312E97]
Your next task is clear. But please reflect on what we have discussed.

Id: [0x01312E9B]
Hey, I’m by the elevator. Get over here.

Id: [0x01312E9D]
I got tired of waiting for Melanie’s stupid repair crew, so I got this piece of shit working well enough to get you to the lobby and back.

Id: [0x01312E9F]
I’ve added the location of the next server to your map. Get going!

Id: [0x01312EA5]
Shit. I forgot, the server is behind a level 1 security lock.

Id: [0x01312EA7]
{20000423}{20000423}{20000423}Aarrghhh! I should have given you level 1 clearance, but for now you can download it off a computer at the information desk.

Id: [0x01312EA9]
{20000425}{20000425}{20000425}Hey, numbskull, you need to get the clearance from the information desk!

Id: [0x01312EAA]
{20000426}{20000426}{20000426}If you’re lost, check your map, but... don’t you work here?

Id: [0x01312EAB]
{20000427}{20000427}{20000427}The information desk is across from the coffee stand. Whatever you do, DO NOT DRINK THE COFFEE.

Id: [0x01312EAD]
Great! Now you can get into the server room.

Id: [0x01312EB0]
And you’re in!

Id: [0x01312EBB]
Great job, numbskull. The data we have is pretty raw, but it’s enough to move forward. Get back up here, double time!

Id: [0x01312EC1]
It looks like restoring servers also clears the virus from some of the other systems.

Id: [0x01312EC3]
You are making excellent progress. I am eager to see what Shay will show us next.

Id: [0x01312EC5]
Level 1 clearance will also let you into some of the other parts of the building as well, if you need to stretch your legs in between Animus sessions.

Id: [0x01312EC8]
We don't have all day, you know.

Id: [0x01312EC9]
Whenever you're ready, numbskull.

Id: [0x01312ECA]
You heard the man... Get back in that chair.

Id: [0x01312ECB]
Will you sit down already?

Id: [0x01312ECF]
Do you understand now?

Id: [0x01312ED0]
I’m starting to see why you’re so interested in Shay Cormac.

Id: [0x01312ED4]
Shay has seen the true face of the world. And he has chosen his path accordingly. A similar choice will soon present itself to you.

Id: [0x01312ED6]
I did not think you'd get this far, but you seem to be on the right track. We still can’t access the servers in the basement. But there’s another one located at the top of the building, near Melanie’s office. That’s your next stop.

Id: [0x01312EDD]
We need to unlock the next server, numbskull.

Id: [0x01312EDE]
Take the elevator to the 15th floor. Go on!

Id: [0x01312EDF]
Do I need to light a fire under your ass? Like a literal fire? Because I will set you on fire.

Id: [0x01312EE0]
I know you must have questions. All will be revealed in time.

Id: [0x01312EE1]
If you work hard for me, I will reward you appropriately.

Id: [0x01312EE2]
I do not lose patience easily, but I am losing patience with you. Carry out your orders. Now.

Id: [0x01312EE7]
Could you stop by my office? We need to have a talk.

Id: [0x01312EE9]
{20000489}{20000489}{20000489}Forgive the interruption, but we have detected another emitter interfering with the security cameras on the floor.

Id: [0x01312EEB]
{20000491}{20000491}{20000491}It would be wise to disable it before discussing any sensitive matters.

Id: [0x01312EED]
{20000493}{20000493}{20000493}Excellent work. Violet has disabled the feed. Proceed to Ms. Lemay's office.

Id: [0x01312EF2]
{20000498}{20000498}{20000498}I’d love it if you could solve our little... “problem”, before we have our chat, okay?

Id: [0x01312EF3]
{20000499}{20000499}{20000499}I think you should do... the thing... before we talk about... stuff.

Id: [0x01312EF8]
This office used to belong to a man named Olivier Garneau. He was my predecessor as Chief Creative Officer of Abstergo Entertainment.

Id: [0x01312EFA]
Otso Berg is a representative from our parent company, Abstergo Industries. He’s showing you the true history of the world, just like they showed me.

Id: [0x01312EFC]
Olivier was kind, he was intelligent, and passionate about our work. But a year ago, he caught a glimpse of this truth.

Id: [0x01312EFE]
They never found his body.

Id: [0x01312F00]
This is not the way we normally bring people up to speed on these matters. But you’ve worked hard and are proving yourself so!

Id: [0x01312F02]
I’m granting you Level 2 security access. The servers on this floor should unlock more of Shay's memories.

Id: [0x01312F07]
Please don’t disappoint me like Olivier did.

Id: [0x01312F08]
Come on, you’ve come a long way, but you’re not done yet! Get to the servers.

Id: [0x01312F09]
Please restore the servers for our friend Mr. Berg.

Id: [0x01312F0D]
Berg wants those servers up and running. Now!

Id: [0x01312F13]
Smooth moves, numbskull, I’ve got the next set of Shay’s memories loaded up and ready to go.

Id: [0x01312F14]
We are nearly there. Know that you are aiding a worthy cause, even if you do not yet know what it is.

Id: [0x01312F17]
Come on. Back in the chair.

Id: [0x01312F18]
We don't have all day. Hurry up!

Id: [0x01312F19]
You know the drill. Let's move.

Id: [0x01312F1A]
Show must go on. Sit your ass down, numbskull.

Id: [0x01312F48]
[Laugh]Incredible! Who knew that Shay had that kind of potential?

Id: [0x01312F4C]
I have everything I need to complete our assignment here.

Id: [0x01312F4E]
One last job, numbskull. We need you to upload Shay’s story.

Id: [0x01312F50]
But not to Helix. I want some very specific people to see what we have found here.

Id: [0x01312F55]
To reward you for your services to me, I am granting you Level 3 security access. From this point on, no doors will be closed to you.

Id: [0x01312F57]
Hey, this is not the time to fuck around. Get to the basement, double time!

Id: [0x01312F59]
In the distant past, the Assassins had a noble goal, that of peace. But over the centuries, that goal eroded into a far more dangerous one: Freedom.

Id: [0x01312F5E]
Shit! What’s going on now?

Id: [0x01312F5F]
A minor setback.

Id: [0x01312F60]
Okay... Your communicator doesn’t work right now, and it must be dark as hell down there... but I can show you the way.

Id: [0x01312F62]
The Assassin Brotherhood still exists today, and they remain dedicated to their foolish cause.

Id: [0x01312F64]
I am a Templar Knight. I protect the world from the Assassins.

Id: [0x01312F66]
Today, you have helped me to fulfill this role. Please, restore the servers.

Id: [0x01312F6C]
Huh. That’s weird. There’s still a tiny chunk of Shay’s memory left over. I wonder what it could be.

Id: [0x01312F6F]
You have exceeded my every expectation. Use that terminal to upload Shay’s story to the Assassin network.

Id: [0x01312F72]
The time to strike is now!

Id: [0x01312F73]
It’s time to show the Brotherhood how weak they truly are!

Id: [0x01312F74]
Upload the data, now!

Id: [0x01312F7A]
The modern day Assassins are weak. It is only a matter of time before I catch the last of them, and kill them.

Id: [0x01312F7E]
But it is not enough for them to die.

Id: [0x01312F81]
I want them to know how weak they truly are, and I want everyone to see them suffer.

Id: [0x01312F84]
So on the day they finally meet me, they will welcome the death I offer them.

Id: [0x01312F97]
My plan is in motion. I have no further demands to place upon you. However, Shay’s story is not complete. I would ask that you see it through to the end.

Id: [0x01312F9C]
I am super impressed, numbskull. You really came through for us. And yes, I'm also a Templar. Have been for years.

Id: [0x01312F9E]
There’s still one last chunk of Shay’s data left to explore. It’s a bit of a trip, but I think you should see it.

Id: [0x01312FA1]
Once you go back to finish Shay’s story, your life is never going to be the same afterwards. You should finish any outstanding business before entering your Animus.

Id: [0x01312FA4]
It is my pleasure and privilege to welcome you up here today.

Id: [0x01312FA5]
Gotta hand it to you, numbskull, you proved yourself to be more than a simple research monkey.

Id: [0x01312FA9]
The data you extracted from Shay Cormac’s memories has served us well.

Id: [0x01312FAA]
Shay’s story is a message. One that says that when threatened, what an Assassin truly wants isn’t freedom but order.

Id: [0x01312FAB]
And we represent the highest Order there is.

Id: [0x01312FAD]
Whatever you learned from your Animus experience only scratches the surface. We have existed since before recorded human history and have recently been reborn, disguised as Abstergo Industries.

Id: [0x01312FAE]
And Entertainment.

Id: [0x01312FAF]
You have crossed the threshold and your eyes have been opened. You have seen the world for what it truly is.

Id: [0x01312FB0]
There’s no turning back now. We’ve got big plans for you!

Id: [0x01312FB1]
The Father of Understanding guided you to us. And for that we are grateful.

Id: [0x01312FB3]
The test of your true worth begins now. And it begins with a choice.

Id: [0x01312FB5]
Join us, and a bright future will be all yours.

Id: [0x01312FB7]

Id: [0x013131F3]
Servers, numbskull! Servers!

Id: [0x013131F5]
Come on! I want to see what Shay does next.

Id: [0x013131F6]
Things are just getting good in your Animus sessions, keep it up!

Id: [0x013131F7]
Don’t quit on me now!

Id: [0x013131F8]
You’ve done great work so far, don’t stop now. Last job’s in the basement.

Id: [0x013131F9]
We are nearly there. All you need to do is upload Shay’s story.

Id: [0x013131FA]
Go upload Shay’s memories. I don’t want to repeat myself.

Id: [0x013131FD]
There’s just this one nugget of data left. Can you check it out

Id: [0x013131FE]
It’s probably nothing, but there’s one last bit of Shay’s memories you should look at.

Id: [0x013131FF]
Can you investigate this extra chunk of genetic memory for me? I’ll owe you one.

Id: [0x01313200]
No more orders, numbskull, but could you do me a favor? There’s one last genetic memory to see.

Id: [0x0131325A]
How could God do this to them?

Id: [0x0131325B]
God had nothing to do with this.

Id: [0x0131325C]
(heavy breathing and laughing) That was... lucky.

Id: [0x0131325D]
How many times do I have to tell you, Liam? I make my own luck.

Id: [0x0131325E]
And how'd you do that, you bastard!?[beat] You broke the Assassins. Betrayed everyone you knew... You sided with... our worst enemies... And for what?

Id: [0x0131325F]
To save the world.

Id: [0x01313260]
{20001376}{20001376}{20001376}And what a world you have made, Shay.

Id: [0x01313265]
No!

Id: [0x01313266]
Why not?

Id: [0x01313267]
Achilles is harmless now, a Mentor with no followers. What kind of world are we making if we cannot show mercy?

Id: [0x01313268]
Besides, he understands what these Precursor sites are now. Without him, the Assassins may continue their search.

Id: [0x01313269]
Valid points.

Id: [0x0131326B]
Never forget what has happened here.

Id: [0x0131326C]
I won't...

Id: [0x0131326D]
(Grunt of pain)

Id: [0x0131326E]
But the world will.

Id: [0x0131326F]
{20001391}{20001391}{20001391}Land ho!

Id: [0x01313271]
Is this the Apple?

Id: [0x01313272]
No! Don't touch anything!

Id: [0x01313275]
Disrespectful to the end!

Id: [0x01313276]
Yes, we've been working on that...

Id: [0x01313277]
Right or wrong, Shay, you betrayed the Brotherhood, Achilles, and me.

Id: [0x01313279]
What would he know?

Id: [0x0131327B]
More than me, apparently.

Id: [0x0131327C]
Says the man who shot me in the back.

Id: [0x0131327D]
At the Homestead? That was Chevalier.[beat] I don't miss!

Id: [0x0131327F]
Finally, you understand, Achilles.[beat] This is a structure to hold the world together, not a weapon to control it. This whole calamity could have been avoided if you'd only listened to me!

Id: [0x01313283]
Was it you? Tell me!

Id: [0x01313284]
I had to...

Id: [0x01313287]
Did you have to bring that damned Manuscript and Box all the way out here, Liam?

Id: [0x01313288]
The Precursor Box is safe, Shay. Chevalier took care of that. You'll never find it!

Id: [0x01313289]
I'll find the Box after I get the Manuscript from you!

Id: [0x0131328A]
{20001418}{20001418}{20001418}They will hunt you down, Shay. Achilles warned those Assassins to kill you on sight.

Id: [0x0131328B]
{20001419}{20001419}{20001419}I did away with Cap'n Joseph, that should serve for practice.

Id: [0x0131328C]
{20001420}{20001420}{20001420}You...

Id: [0x0131328D]
I found Hope's body, Shay.

Id: [0x0131328E]
I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0131328F]
No... You chose to!

Id: [0x013132A5]
I've heard Louisbourg could be a lynchpin in the war. If the Royal Navy can take that fort, it'll be clear sailing down the Saint Lawrence.

Id: [0x013132A6]
Then onto Quebec and Montreal... The tide is turning.

Id: [0x013132AE]
There she is! The HMS Pembroke. Captain James Cook's ship.

Id: [0x013132AF]
[whistles]She's a beauty.

Id: [0x013132B0]
Man-o-war. Fully armed. We should bring the Morrigan alongside, Master Kenway will surely be waiting.

Id: [0x01313E35]

Id: [0x01313E42]

Id: [0x01313E43]
A strange man bribed some local chaps to make improvements to the area.

Id: [0x01313E45]

Id: [0x01313E54]

Id: [0x01313E55]
What did you do?

Id: [0x01313E56]
Well, obviously, I closed my book! But then he yelled at me for half an hour!

Id: [0x01313E57]

Id: [0x01313E58]

Id: [0x01313E62]

Id: [0x01313E6B]

Id: [0x01313F6F]
Such a tragedy.

Id: [0x01313F70]
Do you think it could happen here? An earthquake, I mean?

Id: [0x01313F71]
Rumor has it that Lawrence Washington has tuberculosis.

Id: [0x01313F72]
Oh dear.

Id: [0x01313F73]
What he needs is travel. Some time in the tropics might set him right!

Id: [0x01313F74]
Are you still drinking that awful de Grandpré coffee?

Id: [0x01313F75]
Yes, it's delicious!

Id: [0x01313F76]
Haven't you heard that it causes fit men to limp? Why can't you drink tea like a proper Englishman?

Id: [0x01313F78]
I'm not a failure as an artist! I painted a portrait of Lawrence Washington himself!

Id: [0x01313F79]
Hey, Washington's dead now! Can we get the painting back? We could sell it!

Id: [0x01313F7A]
Well, there's no proof I did it. I never signed the portrait.

Id: [0x01313F7B]
You moron!

Id: [0x01313F7D]
Still no word from the Stalwart. My business can't wait.

Id: [0x01313F7E]
Honestly, merchants are so unreliable these days.

Id: [0x01313F7F]
I should just start dealing with smugglers.

Id: [0x01313F81]
What's the matter?

Id: [0x01313F82]
I lost my father to typhoid fever.

Id: [0x01313F83]
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Id: [0x01313F85]
I don't like the looks of this war.

Id: [0x01313F86]
Do you think we should volunteer for the army?

Id: [0x01313F87]
I think we should all find a way to get along.

Id: [0x01313F89]
That nasty business at Jumonville has escalated the tension around these parts.

Id: [0x01313F8B]
A group of displaced natives came through here the other day.

Id: [0x01313F8D]
So there I was at Carillon, and I see Captain Lee take a bullet to the chest. I tried to reach him, but took a fall, and lost sight of him.

Id: [0x01313F8E]
That was a right mess, that was.

Id: [0x01313F8F]
Our men were getting slaughtered all around me, and I'm screaming "Where's Charles Lee?" over and over. Oh I looked like a right arsehole.

Id: [0x01313F90]
I do not understand, surely there must be room for all of us out here?

Id: [0x01313F91]
Our King certainly doesn't see it that way.

Id: [0x01313F93]
I wish there was something we could do for the people of Lisbon.

Id: [0x01313F94]
Like what?

Id: [0x01313F95]
I don't know. I guess I'll just pray for them.

Id: [0x01313F96]
I'm sure that will help undo an earthquake.

Id: [0x01313F98]
Did I ever tell you that General Braddock once stayed at my family's inn?

Id: [0x01313F99]
Yes, you said he was a cruel man, and acted like an ugly dog.

Id: [0x01313F9A]
Yes. I'm glad he's dead!

Id: [0x01313F9D]
I tell you, things have been tense since the Jumonville affair.

Id: [0x01313F9E]
I agree. A line has been crossed.

Id: [0x01313F9F]
If England and France aren't at war in Europe yet, they soon will be.

Id: [0x01313FA1]
Good show, lads, we chased those criminals right out of our territory.

Id: [0x01313FA2]
Thank you, sir, but I don't think it was us who did it.

Id: [0x01313FA3]
Nonsense! If it wasn't us, then who?

Id: [0x01313FA5]
Now that the undesirable element is out, it's our duty to keep it out!

Id: [0x01313FA6]
For the glory of His Majesty the King!

Id: [0x01313FA8]
Sir, why does England hate the French so much?

Id: [0x01313FA9]
Because they speak French. What other reason do you need?

Id: [0x01313FAA]
Fair enough.

Id: [0x01313FAC]
England has a long history of taking other people and making them her own.

Id: [0x01313FAD]
But surely that doesn't mean we want French people among us?

Id: [0x01313FAE]
Of course not. What we want, of course, is their land.

Id: [0x01313FB0]
The French are on the verge of defeat. They'll be ready to surrender in no time!

Id: [0x01313FB1]
The French are a cunning and skilled enemy, and are not to be taken lightly.

Id: [0x01313FB2]
Are we talking about the same enemy, sir?

Id: [0x01313FB4]
The French we are fighting are not the soft Kings and filthy nobles that we mock on a daily basis.

Id: [0x01313FB5]
Indeed, they are vicious bastards who think they own everything that they see.

Id: [0x01313FB6]
France has terrorized Europe for hundreds of years, and we will not allow that to continue in the New World!

Id: [0x01313FB8]
Keep your eyes peeled, men. There could still be French lurking about.

Id: [0x01313FB9]
They'll stay away if they know what's good for them.

Id: [0x01313FBB]
We don't have the tools or manpower to do much of anything around here.

Id: [0x01313FBC]
Damn. I suppose the citizens will have to take care of their own buildings for a while.

Id: [0x01313FBD]
At least until the fighting stops.

Id: [0x01313FBF]
We must do whatever we can to assist the people in making the area more livable.

Id: [0x01313FC0]
We'll do what we can, sir.

Id: [0x01313FC1]
There's always more work to be done!

Id: [0x01313FC3]
We can't do much to help the construction, but we can double our patrols to make sure that it goes smoothly.

Id: [0x01313FC4]
I hope they build a new tavern.

Id: [0x01313FC5]
Agreed. One with edible food would be nice.

Id: [0x01313FC7]
This place is looking absolutely smashing.

Id: [0x01313FC8]
No one works harder than we do, that's for damn sure.

Id: [0x01313FCA]
After all this hard work to fix the place up, I hope the war doesn't come to wreck it.

Id: [0x01313FCB]
We'll have to make sure that doesn't happen.

Id: [0x01313FCD]
These criminals are a cowardly and superstitious lot.

Id: [0x01313FCE]
Let's put the fear of God into them!

Id: [0x01313FCF]
That's what I want to hear! Good show!

Id: [0x01313FD1]
Crime under control and not a Frenchman in sight.

Id: [0x01313FD2]
My God, it's good to be English.

Id: [0x01313FD3]
Ha, ha! Indeed! Indeed.

Id: [0x01313FD5]
We hold this line! For King and Country, do you understand me?

Id: [0x01313FD6]
Sir, yes sir!

Id: [0x01313FD7]
Repeat it! What do we do?

Id: [0x01313FD8]
We hold the line!

Id: [0x01313FDA]
Be honest with me. What are you afraid of?

Id: [0x01313FDB]
I'm afraid to die, sir.

Id: [0x01313FDC]
I'm afraid to die, as well. But I am not afraid of the French. Do you see the difference?

Id: [0x01313FDD]
How long do you reckon the English and French have been fighting?

Id: [0x01313FDE]
Since Crecy, I'd wager. That was what, 1346?

Id: [0x01313FDF]
Long before that, even. At least since the death of Harold Godwinson. Centuries of war.

Id: [0x01313FE1]
It seems to me there's more clashes between England and France everywhere in the world except for England and France.

Id: [0x01313FE2]
The Empire needs more land.

Id: [0x01313FE3]
Looking around, you'd think there was plenty of that. But I guess not.

Id: [0x01313FE6]
I think the French may have a stronger army, but I think the Royal Navy could turn the tide.

Id: [0x01313FE7]
How so?

Id: [0x01313FE8]
The Navy could attack all of France's colonies. Weaken their economy, force them to adopt desperate measures.

Id: [0x01313FEA]
All I'm saying is, that lining up like we do to fire muskets will leave us vulnerable.

Id: [0x01313FEB]
I'll hear no more of this disobedient nonsense!

Id: [0x01313FEC]
There ought to be a smarter way to wage war!

Id: [0x01313FEE]
Keep your Brown Bess on your shoulder while you march.

Id: [0x01313FEF]
It's the most reliable firearm ever created!

Id: [0x01313FF0]
She's your best friend when trouble rears its head.

Id: [0x01313FF2]
We have seasoned veterans among our ranks here, and yet we're to be subordinate to some junior officer, fresh off the boat?

Id: [0x01313FF3]
It is irksome, I agree, but it is the way of things.

Id: [0x01313FF5]
Do you think we should just be our own nation, with our own army?

Id: [0x01313FF6]
That sounds like treason to me.

Id: [0x01313FF7]
I'm just asking!

Id: [0x01313FF9]
I joined the army for the pay.

Id: [0x01313FFA]
If I'm being honest, I joined for the uniform.

Id: [0x01313FFB]
It is a bold colour, isn't it?

Id: [0x01313FFD]
The war with the French will be over soon.

Id: [0x01313FFE]
If we don't find a way to make peace with the natives, we'll have a new war before too long.

Id: [0x01313FFF]
Nonsense, there will be treaties, I'm sure.

Id: [0x01314000]
It's starting to feel a little crowded around here. Perhaps we should move further west.

Id: [0x01314001]
There are a lot of unhappy natives to the west.

Id: [0x01314002]
It's nice here. Lots of interesting people.

Id: [0x01314003]
I was a fur trader in the Ohio Country. But I had to leave.

Id: [0x01314004]
Why?

Id: [0x01314005]
Too much tension between the English, French, and natives.

Id: [0x01314027]
Look around, gullible marks as far as the eye can see!

Id: [0x01314028]
We'll set ourselves up good and proper.

Id: [0x01314029]
Life is good, out here in the wilderness!

Id: [0x0131402C]
We need more people.

Id: [0x0131402D]
We need more guns.

Id: [0x0131402E]
We can get all that if we bring in more cash.

Id: [0x01314030]
It's getting desperate out here. Your contact come through?

Id: [0x01314031]
Round up the crew. We got a job.

Id: [0x01314032]
Oh, thank God.

Id: [0x01314034]
What is the first rule of crime?

Id: [0x01314035]
Don't get caught.

Id: [0x01314036]
Don't get caught! So why do you keep getting caught?

Id: [0x01314038]
Work is getting scarce, boss.

Id: [0x01314039]
Don't I know it.

Id: [0x0131403A]
At this rate, I'm going to have to enlist in the damn army!

Id: [0x0131403C]
I hate making deals with the French.

Id: [0x0131403D]
They're always late.

Id: [0x0131403E]
This is no way to run an illicit business.

Id: [0x01314041]
Times are tough.

Id: [0x01314042]
We need to take any job we can find.

Id: [0x01314043]
We don't have a choice.

Id: [0x01314045]
You want to run this gang?

Id: [0x01314046]
Yes!

Id: [0x01314047]
Well... you can't!

Id: [0x01314049]
I'm thinking we should move our operations further south, to Saint Domingue.

Id: [0x0131404A]
That's an awful long way.

Id: [0x0131404B]
An earthquake caused a lot of chaos. Chaos equals opportunity.

Id: [0x0131404D]
Hey, you doing anything right now?

Id: [0x0131404E]
Not much.

Id: [0x0131404F]
Good, come with me. I'm going to round up some cattle for Silas Thatcher over in Boston.

Id: [0x01314051]
I want to move that shipment of typhoid fever cure by the end of the week.

Id: [0x01314052]
Does it really cure Typhoid fever?

Id: [0x01314053]
Course not. Which is why we have to get money from folks while they're still alive.

Id: [0x01314055]
I'm thinking we should expand our operations to the sea. Do you know anything about boats?

Id: [0x01314056]
They float on water?

Id: [0x01314057]
You're hired!

Id: [0x01314059]
Nothing like a war to line the pockets!

Id: [0x0131405A]
Lots of desperate people looking for a bit of food or an extra gun.

Id: [0x0131405B]
And we have it all, for a price!

Id: [0x0131405D]
Robbing the corpses after a battle doesn't feel right.

Id: [0x0131405E]
Don't stop your whining and I'll lay you out alongside those corpses.

Id: [0x01314060]
I met a weird fella in the tavern the other day. Said if we shipped slaves to a place called "Chichen Itza" there'd be decent coin in it for us.

Id: [0x01314061]
Where the hell is Chichen Itza?

Id: [0x01314062]
I have no idea. I think he was drunk and making shit up.

Id: [0x01314064]
So my plan is, we steal a boat, use it to get to a merchant boat, and then steal the merchant boat.

Id: [0x01314065]
What you're suggesting is piracy.

Id: [0x01314066]
No, no, no! Boat thieving! It's a thing I just invented.

Id: [0x01314068]
If I tell you to rob a fort, you rob a fort!

Id: [0x01314069]
But then we'll have soldiers after us!

Id: [0x0131406A]
They have better things to do right now than deal with us. There's a war on!

Id: [0x0131406C]
The French are getting big heads, but I think the English could rally back and win.

Id: [0x0131406D]
I don't care who wins the war. Both sides have money they can spend. Get back to work.

Id: [0x0131406E]
No rest for the wicked.

Id: [0x01314070]
We got a new contract from, get this, the government.

Id: [0x01314071]
What is it?

Id: [0x01314072]
They want us to go burn native villages to stop them from working with the other side.

Id: [0x01314073]
Fuck that. We're brigands, not murderers.

Id: [0x01314075]
New settlements need workers. The death rate out there in the wild is pretty high.

Id: [0x01314076]
If we could supply their demand for cheap labor, we'd be rich.

Id: [0x01314077]
Let's see what we can do.

Id: [0x01314079]
I'm not joining the army!

Id: [0x0131407A]
But then I'd have someone on the inside! Think of the opportunities!

Id: [0x0131407B]
I'll get shot if they catch me! Forget it!

Id: [0x0131407E]
How drunk was I last night?

Id: [0x0131407F]
I don't know, I passed out.

Id: [0x01314080]
I woke up by falling out of a tree.

Id: [0x01314082]
Since the comet, there is a new demand for telescopes.

Id: [0x01314083]
Where the hell are we going to find telescopes?

Id: [0x01314084]
Maybe we could build some?

Id: [0x01314086]
It seems pretty clear to me that the English are gonna to win the war.

Id: [0x01314087]
That seems pretty likely.

Id: [0x01314088]
Everything French we have is on sale now. I want it all out of our warehouses as fast as we can.

Id: [0x0131408A]
What are you just standing around for?

Id: [0x0131408B]
With the war all but over, what else have we got to do?

Id: [0x0131408C]
Wars come and go, friend, but money is forever. Get back to work!

Id: [0x0131408D]
Do you know how to count in French?

Id: [0x0131408E]
No. Why?

Id: [0x0131408F]
Every time we make a deal with the French, they give me a look that makes me think they're cheating us.

Id: [0x01314091]
The French are getting chased out of here.

Id: [0x01314092]
With extreme prejudice.

Id: [0x01314093]
We need them to settle their debts before they go. Don't take [FR]"non" for an answer.

Id: [0x01314095]
I've got all this wine to sell, if the French are gone, who will drink it?

Id: [0x01314096]
Just write "beer" on the bottle and sell it to the English.

Id: [0x01314097]
Those idiots will drink anything.

Id: [0x01314099]
These British are going to be a problem.

Id: [0x0131409A]
You see a problem, I see an opportunity.

Id: [0x0131409B]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0131409C]
They got wants, don't they? They got needs. We just have to figure out what they are. Then sell it to them.

Id: [0x0131409E]
So I hear you've got a new plan to get rich?

Id: [0x013140A0]
I can't wait for the war to be over.

Id: [0x013140A1]
After years of fear and violence, I could make do with a little bit of boredom.

Id: [0x013140A8]
Now that the French are gone, we should lay low for a while.

Id: [0x013140A9]
That seems reasonable.

Id: [0x013140AA]
We'll come back in a few months, and greet everyone in the King's English.

Id: [0x013140AC]
There's a change in the air.

Id: [0x013140AD]
We should keep a low profile and see how things turn out.

Id: [0x013140AE]
There will be new opportunities soon enough, but for now, let's tighten our belts.

Id: [0x013140B0]
This place is a dungheap! Look at the shabby condition of these buildings.

Id: [0x013140B1]
You know what that means!

Id: [0x013140B2]
The price of tools and lumber is going up!

Id: [0x013140B4]
I want you to get involved in the repair efforts in the area.

Id: [0x013140B5]
You got it, boss.

Id: [0x013140B6]
Make sure everything takes twice as long and needs twice as many materials.

Id: [0x013140B7]
Yes boss!

Id: [0x013140B9]
Repairs are happening too quickly.

Id: [0x013140BA]
You want me to vandalize a few buildings? Slow it down?

Id: [0x013140BB]
No, but let's acquire less raw materials, and start investing in some carpenters and cabinetmakers.

Id: [0x013140BD]
We're barely making any money on these raw materials! What are you thinking?

Id: [0x013140BE]
I'm thinking that if the neighborhood gets better, then it attracts a richer kind of citizen.

Id: [0x013140BF]
Oh, so this is like an investment in our future crimes.

Id: [0x013140C0]
Now you're catching on.

Id: [0x013140C2]
These buildings sure got fancy in a hurry.

Id: [0x013140C3]
Yup.

Id: [0x013140C4]
Guess we should start breaking into a few of 'em. See what goods they're hiding.

Id: [0x013140C5]
Yup.

Id: [0x013140C7]
None of the buildings need any repairs any more. What are we going to do with all this lumber?

Id: [0x013140C8]
Those buildings look nice on the outside, but they'll need something for their insides.

Id: [0x013140C9]
I'll get some of our boys into the cabinetmaking shops.

Id: [0x013140CB]
Look at this place, tell me what you see?

Id: [0x013140CC]
I don't know. Some buildings? Some trees? A few people?

Id: [0x013140CD]
I see the beginnings of an empire. My empire!

Id: [0x013140CF]
We collect protection money. We run brothels. We import and export whatever the people want, provided they can pay.

Id: [0x013140D0]
I got you.

Id: [0x013140D1]
Good. Now go get paid.

Id: [0x013140D3]
I hate doing business with the French.

Id: [0x013140D5]
We are running low on baking ingredients.

Id: [0x013140D6]
The French eat their own weight in baked goods every day.

Id: [0x013140D7]
We should double our orders of coffee while we're at it.

Id: [0x013140D8]
Why? They're usually pretty pleasant and they always pay on time.

Id: [0x013140D9]
Our business is usually clandestine, but the French are just so... loud.

Id: [0x013140DA]
I think we should become art thieves.

Id: [0x013140DB]
Do you see a lot of museums around here? Idiot.

Id: [0x013140DD]
That shithead guard whipped me and my fucking back is killing me. Fuck me, I can't believe I got caught.

Id: [0x013140DE]
What'd they get you for? Smuggling? Murder?

Id: [0x013140DF]
No. Swearing!

Id: [0x013140E2]
All points ready.

Id: [0x013140E3]
Begin.

Id: [0x013140E4]
Go! Go! Go!

Id: [0x013140E7]
Who are you?

Id: [0x013140E9]
Don’t you touch her!

Id: [0x013140EB]
Oh, for God’s sake. Restrain him!

Id: [0x013140ED]
You, give me the child.[beat] Shush now, you’re alright.

Id: [0x013140EF]
Elina!

Id: [0x013140F0]
Calm down, Mr. Berg. I promise you I won’t hurt your daughter.

Id: [0x013140F1]
Who are you?

Id: [0x013140F2]
My name is Warren Vidic. I work for Abstergo Industries. You quit the Utti Jaeger regiment and became a freelance mercenary in order to afford better care for Elina’s cystic fibrosis.

Id: [0x013140F4]
How’s that working out for you?

Id: [0x013140F5]
Perkele!

Id: [0x013140F7]
I have an offer for you.

Id: [0x013140F8]
I don’t work for people I don’t know.

Id: [0x013140F9]
It’s not that kind of offer. I’m going to remove an item from my pocket.

Id: [0x013140FB]
What is that?

Id: [0x013140FC]
This little pill? It’s actually for her. Go on, little one, have some medicine...

Id: [0x013140FD]
Stop!

Id: [0x013140FF]
There now, isn’t that better?[to OTSO] This pill will cure her... It isn’t on the market. But it can be yours, if you agree to participate in a little training program I’ve put together.

Id: [0x01314100]
What does Abstergo need with someone like me?

Id: [0x01314101]
Oh, you won’t be working for Abstergo. However, if you perform, Abstergo could work for you.

Id: [0x01314102]
I want one thing before I agree.

Id: [0x01314103]
Name it.

Id: [0x01314104]
That one there, he upset my daughter.

Id: [0x01314105]
I understand. Gentlemen, release Mr. Berg.

Id: [0x01314107]
Jenkins, give him your gun.

Id: [0x01314108]
What?

Id: [0x01314109]
Now.

Id: [0x0131410A]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x0131410D]
Satisfied?

Id: [0x0131410E]
It’s a start.

Id: [0x01314111]
Otso Berg. The big star of the Animi Training Program. Show me what you’ve got, you arrogant prick!

Id: [0x01314112]
If you insist, Master Cross.

Id: [0x01314115]
I believe that my training will soon be complete. Wouldn’t you agree?

Id: [0x01314117]
What’s so funny?

Id: [0x01314118]
I was wrong about you. You’re not arrogant, you’re just deeply fucking stupid.

Id: [0x01314119]
Oh?

Id: [0x0131411A]
Your body, your mind, they’re not yours anymore, you understand? All you have left are the voices.

Id: [0x0131411B]
I don’t suffer from your condition. My Animus sessions were carefully --

Id: [0x0131411C]
No, no, no! My voices are ghosts. Dead. So they can only ever say the same things over and over and over and over.

Id: [0x0131411D]
But the ones in your head will never die. And they own you now.

Id: [0x0131411E]
I am the Order’s humble servant.

Id: [0x0131411F]
You’re not even a person anymore! You’re a tool, a weapon, a plaything!

Id: [0x01314120]
We’re done here.

Id: [0x01314122]
And in their glorious New World Order, there won’t be any room for broken toys like us!

Id: [0x01314125]
It is 4:26 on December 13, 2012. Debriefing of Sigma Team’s Cairo Operation. Debriefing conducted by: Abstergo Psychiatrist Ctibor Hasek, level 7, and Director of Operations Laetitia England, level 9.

Id: [0x01314126]
State your name and rank for the record.

Id: [0x01314127]
Juhani Otso Berg. Service number OP114-8506-B. Master Templar.

Id: [0x01314128]
How would you classify the result of your Cairo mission, Master Berg?

Id: [0x01314129]
I would call it a complete success. The new Sigma Team performed admirably.

Id: [0x0131412A]
That’s going a bit far, don’t you think?

Id: [0x0131412B]
The target William Miles was apprehended and the First Civilization artifact was retrieved. Both were handed off to Warren Vidic without incident.[beat] May I ask how you would rate the mission?

Id: [0x0131412C]
We’re pleased with the results, but not with the methods with which you achieved them.

Id: [0x0131412D]
I see. May I ask why?

Id: [0x0131412E]
You went off mission. You were supposed to apprehend the target at the airport, not at the museum.

Id: [0x0131412F]
When the target emerged from the plane, he was posing as a tour guide for a class of high school students on a field trip.

Id: [0x01314130]
A member of Sigma Team informed us that you aborted the mission then and there.

Id: [0x01314131]
I will not deny this, but tell me: Who talked?

Id: [0x01314132]
I cannot reveal that.

Id: [0x01314133]
No matter. I will find out on my own. Back to business: The target was very smart, but also very sloppy.

Id: [0x01314134]
Explain.

Id: [0x01314135]
The target possessed advanced counter-surveillance techniques, but lacked the skill to implement them properly.

Id: [0x01314136]
The target was trained as an Assassin since birth.

Id: [0x01314137]
I am aware. However, it has been many years since he was an active field agent. He must have been very desperate to go himself, as these days, he is more of a talker. A puppet master.

Id: [0x01314138]
And what are you?

Id: [0x01314139]
A predator.

Id: [0x0131413A]
A predator who defied orders because of the presence of some schoolgirls.

Id: [0x0131413B]
I prefer to think of myself as one who can choose the most opportune time to strike. The last time I followed orders to the letter was in Florence. That did not end well for anyone.

Id: [0x0131413C]
Was it that, or did the students perhaps remind you of your daughter?

Id: [0x0131413D]
I separate my work and personal life completely.

Id: [0x0131413E]
Your daughter’s recovery has been remarkable. I do hope her progress continues...

Id: [0x0131413F]
Please don’t.

Id: [0x01314140]
I beg your pardon?

Id: [0x01314141]
I find your attempt to threaten my child vulgar and unnecessary.

Id: [0x01314142]
Explain.

Id: [0x01314143]
Abstergo’s pharmaceuticals have given my child a chance at a life free from pain. And I have at last found what I believe to be my calling in life.

Id: [0x01314144]
And for that, we expect obedience.

Id: [0x01314145]
For that, you have my loyalty. The involvement of the children in Egypt compromised the original mission. Nothing more.

Id: [0x01314146]
We already have one Master Templar that we can barely control. I don’t like the idea of having two loose cannons out there.

Id: [0x01314147]
With all due respect to Master Cross, while he is gifted, he is mentally disturbed.

Id: [0x01314148]
We mean no disrespect. But after losing your team in Florence, we felt a need to keep a close eye on you.

Id: [0x01314149]
I achieved all mission objectives, and achieved them without bloodshed. So my only question for you is: Am I in command of Sigma Team or not?

Id: [0x0131414A]
As you said, the results were impeccable.

Id: [0x0131414B]
Then I believe this meeting to be at an end. I request permission to leave.

Id: [0x0131414C]
Do you have something more important to do?

Id: [0x0131414D]
I am going to find out who among my team talked to you. I will not tolerate that kind of insubordination.

Id: [0x0131414E]
I think we can stop here.

Id: [0x0131414F]
Debriefing ended at 4:34. Transcript to be sent to Alan Rikkin for security clearance.

Id: [0x01314152]
Speak.

Id: [0x01314153]
Why has Violet da Costa been removed from Sigma Team?

Id: [0x01314154]
I’m reassigning our assets as I see fit to align with the goals of the Phoenix Project.

Id: [0x01314155]
The Phoenix Project? Sigma Team would be of more use hunting down the remaining Assassins. Let Delta Team hunt Precursor relics instead.

Id: [0x01314156]
Those relics are the key to sequencing First Civilization DNA. Accomplishing that goal will in turn make the Assassins even less of a threat than they are now.

Id: [0x01314157]
Be that as it may, Agent da Costa should not be wasted on something like Abstergo Entertainment.

Id: [0x01314158]
Last year’s fiasco with the Sample 17 Project showed me that Abstergo Entertainment is more than just a disposable subsidiary. It’s the best resource we have to finding new Pieces of Eden.

Id: [0x01314159]
It is a weak link that has been compromised by our enemies time and time again.

Id: [0x0131415A]
All the more reason to have da Costa secure their access to the Cloud servers. We’re confident that Melanie Lemay won’t fuck it up like Olivier Garneau.

Id: [0x0131415B]
Bringing a civilian like that into our ranks is also unwise.

Id: [0x0131415C]
Time will tell with Ms. Lemay, but she handled the John Standish situation with an even hand. She helped us discover the existence of Sages, and in doing so, has done more for Phoenix than you have, Mr. Berg.

Id: [0x0131415D]
She also continues to ignore the presence of the Instruments of the First Will within her operation.

Id: [0x0131415E]
Those whackjobs are actually useful to us for now. They’re a cheap source of relics we can exploit. If they become too much of a problem, we’ll deal with them with the same efficiency we deal with the Assassins.

Id: [0x0131415F]
Giving the Assassins time to regroup is a tactical mistake. We should strike them now, while they are at their most vulnerable.

Id: [0x01314160]
We value your passion and expertise, Mr. Berg, and your concerns have been noted. Now, pack your bags. You’ve got a busy year ahead of you.

Id: [0x01314163]
Field report: Phoenix Project. November 1, 2013. Agent da Costa alerted me to a possible lead on the Koh-i-Noor diamond. A replica can be found among the Crown Jewels of England, however, the true diamond is a powerful Piece of Eden, and has been lost for centuries.

Id: [0x01314164]
Jot Soora is a programmer at MySore Tech, a company working with Abstergo Entertainment to release a variant of the Animus headset to Asia, called the Brahman Device. He’s been associating with Siobhan Dhami, the sister of Jhadsip Dhami, a known Assassin.

Id: [0x01314165]
Update: November 3, 2013: Jot Soora was abducted outside of Dream Land Studios in Mumbai. He was seen being forced into a van by Siobahn and Jhadsip Dhami. This confirms my suspicions.

Id: [0x01314166]
Update: November 4, 2013: I arrived in India too late. Our strike team engaged the Assassins in two separate conflicts. The body of Siobahn Dhami was found at the first site, but her remains were too badly damaged in an explosion to collect any genetic information.

Id: [0x01314168]
Do you care to explain what happened in Paris?

Id: [0x01314169]
Gavin Banks led a team of Assassins to your laboratory and destroyed it.

Id: [0x0131416A]
That lab was supposed to be completely off the grid. How did they find it?

Id: [0x0131416B]
Banks is a known associate of Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane, who have infiltrated Abstergo before.

Id: [0x0131416C]
That facility was dedicated to studying the Sage we recovered from Montreal last year.

Id: [0x0131416D]
If you had informed me of its existence, Sigma Team could have protected your interests.

Id: [0x0131416E]
Did you engage Bank’s team?

Id: [0x0131416F]
Sorkin and I tracked them from Paris to La Rochelle, where their ship was waiting for them. We fought, but we were outnumbered. Sorkin was stabbed seven times by an Assassin we have identified as Galina Voronina.

Id: [0x01314170]
And you let them get away.

Id: [0x01314171]
Let’s be very clear. I was trained to hunt and kill Assassins. It was you who disbanded my team and sent me on a fool’s errand across the surface of the Earth. I warned you this would happen.

Id: [0x01314172]
You know what? I can admit when I’m wrong. You have my permission to re-form Sigma Team.

Id: [0x01314173]
I need da Costa back.

Id: [0x01314174]
Impossible. She’s still in Montreal.

Id: [0x01314175]
Unacceptable.

Id: [0x01314176]
I’ve apologized for my oversight, Berg, but don’t push me. The fact is, we need to find new Sages. Alvaro Gramatica tells me that Melanie Lemay has a few promising leads in Montreal.

Id: [0x01314177]
When will da Costa be finished?

Id: [0x01314178]
She’s ahead of schedule on security upgrades and firewalls, but Helix is a target for Assassins, Erudito, and... the First Civilization consciousness.  So there have been some setbacks.

Id: [0x01314179]
Is the building physically secure?

Id: [0x0131417A]
There’s security on site.

Id: [0x0131417B]
Send me there.

Id: [0x0131417C]
Oh? I thought you were too good to be wasted on such trivial matters.

Id: [0x0131417D]
I want da Costa back on my team, and if that building is a target, I need to make sure she’s looked after. I will also improve their security, in my own way.

Id: [0x0131417E]
Very well. I’ll start preparing the necessary documents. Like da Costa, you’ll be a consultant from Abstergo Industries, there to help bring them up to speed on some new policies.

Id: [0x0131417F]
In the meantime, send some extra agents to Paris. I suspect there may still be Assassins lurking there.

Id: [0x01314182]
Following the Great Purge of 2000, William Miles became the de facto leader of the Assassins. A cunning and ruthless strategist, he trained several agents who infiltrated Abstergo, including Clay Kaczmarek and Lucy Stillman.

Id: [0x01314183]
In late 2012, I captured William Miles in Cairo and delivered him to Warren Vidic in Rome.

Id: [0x01314185]
A grieving William Miles went underground, and left the Brotherhood in the hands of Gavin Banks. Banks led a small team across the globe, attempting to rebuild Assassin cells. We have confirmed sightings in Kyoto, Moscow, and Paris.

Id: [0x01314186]
Miles resurfaced in late 2013, and we have confirmed his involvement in the infiltration of Abstergo Entertainment Montreal by the Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane.

Id: [0x01314187]
Both Miles and Banks remain at large. Agent da Costa has tasked the Akashic Satellite Plexus to sweep the planet for traces of Assassin activities. We have yet to locate them.

Id: [0x0131418A]
Shaun Hastings was a university professor whose hobby was leaking Abstergo secrets. He was hours away from being killed by Abstergo when he was saved by Rebecca Crane, an Assassin hacker.

Id: [0x0131418B]
Hastings and Crane infiltrated Abstergo Entertainment Montreal in late 2013, and were responsible for the theft of classified information.

Id: [0x0131418D]
Rebecca Crane’s skills are not to be underestimated. She created the Animus 2.0, an Assassin version of Warren Vidic’s original machine.

Id: [0x0131418E]
It would seem Crane and Hastings have been promoted within the Brotherhood.

Id: [0x01314191]
Details of Harlan T. Cunningham’s life were difficult to acquire, as many traces of his identity before becoming an Assassin were altered or erased by Gavin Banks.

Id: [0x01314192]
Cunningham was recruited by the Brotherhood in Florence, Italy, under the leadership of Assassin veteran Adriano Maestranzi.

Id: [0x01314194]
Cunningham was last sighted in Rotterdam, alongside Arend Schut, a former mixed martial arts champion who also suffered a career backlash when he came out as homosexual.

Id: [0x01314195]
Recently, Cunningham stole a Piece of Eden from an Abstergo facility in Rotterdam. During the operation, Schut was charged to attack Abstergo employees throughout the city to draw attention away from his mentor.

Id: [0x01314198]
The First Civilization entity known as Juno re-emerged from the Grand Temple in New York in December 2012. Although no longer a corporeal being, she exists as a kind of digital consciousness somewhere in the Abstergo cloud.

Id: [0x01314199]
To accomplish her goals in the real world, Juno uses two types of people. The first is another Precursor consciousness that emerges in a human being at random. This person is commonly known as a Sage.

Id: [0x0131419A]
Abstergo is currently using the First Will as a cheap and hands-off way of acquiring Pieces of Eden and other relics.

Id: [0x0131419B]
Juno’s motives are unclear. Although she has made one attempt to possess a corporeal body, she appears to be more powerful as a digital entity.

Id: [0x0131419E]
Given the nature of our current investigation, I have been looking at other Assassins who, despite themselves, have helped the Templar cause.

Id: [0x0131419F]
However, Kaczmarek may have unexpectedly become useful again. While in the Animus, Subject 16 came into contact with the First Civilization entity known as Juno. Perhaps studying his bizarre Animus experiences can help us find a way to deal with the looming threat Juno promises.

Id: [0x013141A1]
With Subject 16 out of the picture, Vidic needed a replacement. Desmond Miles, a runaway Assassin, was captured in September 2012 and was used as Animus Subject 17, to further the search for an Apple of Eden.

Id: [0x013141A2]
Desmond Miles also reactivated a First Civilization temple in New York and used it to save the world, but it cost him his life. Abstergo recovered his body.

Id: [0x013141A4]
The Assassins would have you believe that Al Mualim was a great Mentor who became corrupted with greed... and that he schemed with the Templars to acquire an Apple of Eden.

Id: [0x013141A5]
I see instead a shrewd and cunning leader. A man who used his best Assassin, Altaïr ibn-la’Ahad, to eliminate his conspirators in order to keep the Apple for himself, so that he could use it to enforce world peace.

Id: [0x013141A6]
While it must be stated unequivocally that Al Mualim was not a Templar, it is interesting to me that his vision of peace was more in line with Templar philosophy than Assassin.

Id: [0x013141A7]
Had Al Mualim not been killed by Altaïr and allowed to carry out his plan, perhaps we would not be fighting now.

Id: [0x013141A9]
François Mackandal saved Baptiste from slavery, and inducted him into his so-called Brotherhood.

Id: [0x013141AA]
Thanks to the calculating genius of Madeleine de L’Isle, the Templars made an example of Mackandal by way of public execution in 1758. His pathetic excuse for a Brotherhood quickly fell apart.

Id: [0x013141AB]
Madeleine saw Baptiste’s potential and instructed her Templars in New Orleans to strike a deal with him.

Id: [0x013141AD]
Duncan Walpole rose through the ranks to become a Master Assassin, but he was restricted by a Brotherhood which chose to send him across the ocean to the West Indies, rather than find a way to nurture his potential.

Id: [0x013141AE]
Once there, Duncan attracted the notice of Laureano Torres, former governor of Cuba and Templar Grand Master.

Id: [0x013141AF]
Sadly, Duncan was killed by a pirate before the Templars could help him achieve his potential.

Id: [0x013141B1]
Haytham Kenway remains a controversial figure for me. I have great respect for him. After all, he was the Grand Master of the Colonial Rite, charged with finding a Precursor site.

Id: [0x013141B2]
He lost his father when he was a child and the British Grand Master, Reginald Birch, raised him to become a Templar knight.

Id: [0x013141B3]
When Haytham discovered that Birch was the one who murdered his father, he and his sister killed him in revenge.

Id: [0x013141B5]
Like Haytham Kenway, Daniel Cross came from an Assassin bloodline, as the Orelov family had at least two generations who served the Brotherhood.

Id: [0x013141B6]
Daniel Cross’s history of drug addiction and Animus-induced psychosis should not take away from his many accomplishments for the Templar cause.

Id: [0x013141B7]
Al Mualim. Haras. Vali cel Tradat. Baptiste. Duncan Walpole. Haytham Kenway. Lucy Stillman. Daniel Cross. These are but a few prominent examples of something I’ve always felt... that there will always be Assassins who are willing to abandon their cause to serve ours.

Id: [0x0131423F]
Haytham was cunning and ruthless, but he had a streak of emotional weakness that ultimately triggered his downfall.

Id: [0x01314240]
Haytham eventually learned that his father Edward had been an Assassin. That he chose to stay a Templar rather than follow in his father's footsteps indicates to me that he believed he was already on the right path.

Id: [0x01314241]
I believe this was the beginning of his downfall. Templars kill for efficiency, not petty emotions.

Id: [0x01314242]
When he discovered that his son Connor was an Assassin working against him in the Colonies, the same emotional weakness stayed his blade. A pity Connor did not show him the same mercy.

Id: [0x01314243]
Under the influence of Warren Vidic, he was planted into the Brotherhood and earned their trust, eventually meeting their reclusive Mentor.

Id: [0x01314245]
Three quarters of the homes in Port-Au-Prince are in ruins because of the earthquake felt last year.

Id: [0x01314249]
Hear now an offer for any intrepid gentlemen who wish to do business in Boston.

Id: [0x0131424F]
Representatives from Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island are set to meet.

Id: [0x01314251]
Miss Amanda Bailey from Martha's Vineyard is pleading for help in locating her friend, one Robert Faulkner, who vanished mysteriously.

Id: [0x01314253]
Citizens are warned that an outbreak of Typhoid is at hand.

Id: [0x01314257]
Now we take a moment to remember General Edward Braddock, affectionately called "the Bulldog" by his loyal men.

Id: [0x01314259]
His Majesty King George pledges his support to the brave colonies fighting against the French and their native allies!

Id: [0x0131425D]
Your local officials would like to remind you that displaced Acadians should be made to feel welcome.

Id: [0x01314267]
In an effort to dissuade the indigenous tribes from allying with the French, the Royal Army has ordered native villages be put to the torch.

Id: [0x0131426D]
The naval supremacy of His Majesty's forces has struck a major blow against the Spanish Empire.

Id: [0x0131426F]
Reconstruction continues in Boston after the terrible fire that city recently suffered.

Id: [0x01314270]
In theory, if you align the beams to segments of the core, it should solve the problem.

Id: [0x01314271]
But here’s where it gets tricky, you have to move the circles in such a way that each segment is powered by a beam. The keyword here is “each”.

Id: [0x01314272]
One beam and one beam only per core segment, okay? Once everything is lit up properly, the system will reboot. Got it? Give it a shot!

Id: [0x01314274]
Each segment of the core needs to be powered by a beam.

Id: [0x01314275]
Make sure you don't have more than one beam assigned to a core segment!

Id: [0x01314276]
Remember, the entire core has to be powered or the system will not reboot.

Id: [0x01314278]
Good job! This core wasn't too complex, but rebooting the advanced hardware in the rest of the building will require more work.

Id: [0x0131427A]
With the servers back online, you could, in theory, restore your coworker's work stations, if you, you know, feel like being helpful.

Id: [0x0131427B]
And you could, in theory, find some more digital goodies, if you, you know, feel like being sneaky!

Id: [0x0131427C]
There! Just follow those lights and you'll be set!

Id: [0x0131427D]
Then his subliminal programming activated, and he killed the Mentor, triggering the first “Great Purge” of the modern age.

Id: [0x0131427E]
Yet there is no one who embodies this idea better than Shay Cormac, and I want the Assassins to confront this painful reality.

Id: [0x01314281]
The lesson is over for today, Shay.

Id: [0x01314282]
Do not be late next time.

Id: [0x01314283]
Remember what I taught you.

Id: [0x01314284]
You have done well, Shay.

Id: [0x01314285]
Farewell for now.

Id: [0x01314286]
All structures built from masonry were destroyed. The government has decided to rebuild the city using wood.

Id: [0x01314287]
That was good, Shay. We'll continue tomorrow...

Id: [0x01314288]
Let's have a pint this evening.

Id: [0x01314289]
Don't let Chevalier get in your head. He'll come around...

Id: [0x0131428A]
We'll talk later, Shay.

Id: [0x0131428B]
You better go on now...

Id: [0x0131428D]
Indeed. Le Chasseur is waiting for us.

Id: [0x0131428E]
Le Chasseur should be there... And with any luck he will know where to find that Manuscript.

Id: [0x01314292]
You'll regret this! And so will the Finnegans!

Id: [0x01314293]
We urge you to put aside the differences in religion and country and offer prayers to those affected by this terrible situation.

Id: [0x01314294]
De Grandpré coffee produces hives about the face and causes fit men to walk with a limp!

Id: [0x01314295]

Show your preference for proper English diet and reject decadent French cookery!

The Royal Army asks the proud citizens of New York to not be alarmed, it is standard procedure for soldiers to cordon off city streets and pluck men from taverns.

Id: [0x01314298]
Rest assured that the tradesmen and negroes who were gathered will be trained properly and treated with the utmost of care.

Id: [0x01314299]
The Royal Army extends its gratitude for these brave men who volunteered for service.

Id: [0x0131429A]
Joyful news from the French colony of Saint-Domingue. The vodou priest known as Francois Mackandal has been caught and executed.

Id: [0x0131429B]
Mackandal led an army of slaves on a murderous rampage against God-fearing men. His conspirators will also be hunted down and put to death.

Id: [0x0131429C]
Let his story stand as a warning to any who worship false idols.

Id: [0x0131429E]
In the first days of the world, the earth was covered with water. There was no light in the sky, neither sun at day nor stars or moon at night.

Id: [0x0131429F]
Under the surface lived the water animals.  Loon, Kingfisher, Otter, Muskrat... they all lived in darkness.

Id: [0x013142A0]
In the sky, the Great Spirit sat beneath the branches of a glowing apple tree with roots that sank into the clouds.

Id: [0x013142A1]
One day, the Great Spirit called to his daughter, the Sky Woman. He pulled up the tree so she could look down to the earth.

Id: [0x013142A2]
"How can they live in such darkness and chaos?" asked the Sky Woman. The Great Spirit replied, "If you desire, you can bring them light and order."

Id: [0x013142A3]
The Great Spirit gathered up the Sky Woman in his hands and gently lowered her down. When he let go, she began to fall slowly towards the earth.

Id: [0x013142A4]
The water animals lifted their heads and looked up in wonder at the glowing woman in the sky. "What will happen when she reaches the water?" they asked one another.

Id: [0x013142A5]
All the animals dove as deep as they could to find land. None could hold their breath long enough until finally, Muskrat brought up a little bit of earth in his paws.

Id: [0x013142A6]
A great turtle arrived, and Muskrat put the earth on his back. The turtle grew and the earth multiplied until they became a great island, which men now call North America.

Id: [0x013142A7]
From beneath the water, the swans flew up to meet The Sky Woman. They caught her and carefully set her down upon the new land.

Id: [0x013142A8]
The Sky Woman thanked the animals. "Now I can give this land spirit," she said. She then gave birth to twin sons.

Id: [0x013142A9]
The son who was born first was born laughing, and was called the Good Spirit. The son who was born second caused the Sky Woman so much pain that she died. He was called the Evil Spirit.

Id: [0x013142AA]
The Good Spirit grieved for his mother. But he took her eyes and raised them into the sky, so one could become the sun and the other the moon. Her tears became the stars. This way, the world would no longer be in darkness.

Id: [0x013142AB]
The Good Spirit buried what was left of his mother under the earth to nourish the soil. All the trees and plants would grow out of her.

Id: [0x013142AC]
Meanwhile, while the Good Spirit worked in the light, the Evil Spirit did mischief within the shadows.

Id: [0x013142AD]
The Evil Spirit crossed the land, moving from shadow to shadow. "I will ruin everything my brother has made!" he said.

Id: [0x013142AE]
And so, when the Good Spirit made strong trees and swift deer, the Evil Spirit made poisonous berries and stinging insects.

Id: [0x013142AF]
Finally, the Good Spirit took red clay from the earth and made humans. He taught humans how to speak and live together. The jealous Evil Spirit made himself servants out of sea foam.

Id: [0x013142B0]
The Good Spirit saw that his creations heeded his words, and were capable of wisdom. He wished that they might live forever in harmony.

Id: [0x013142B1]
The Good Spirit saw the mischief that his brother did and knew that even his help would not be enough. He told his brother to stop making trouble, but the Evil Spirit refused.

Id: [0x013142B2]
Knowing that his brother would respect only violence, the Good Spirit reluctantly challenged the Evil Spirit to combat. The winner would rule the world.

Id: [0x013142B3]
The Good Spirit and his people united and triumphed over the Evil Spirit. He banished his brother to a cave beneath the earth.

Id: [0x013142B4]
On the surface, though, some of the Evil Spirit’s servants still wandered from shadow to shadow. Their influence causes men to do evil things.

Id: [0x013142B5]
This is why there is still evil in the world. But people can also cast out this evil and find the good spirit within. All people can choose the path they follow.

Id: [0x013142B6]
I realize you have no reason to trust me, Master Cormac.

Id: [0x013142B7]
You said you were a friend of the Finnegans.

Id: [0x013142B8]
I am. Their late son... worked for me. You are much like him.

Id: [0x013142B9]
How so?

Id: [0x013142BA]
He cared. And he wanted to do good by the people. We shared a dream, he and I, that of making the world a better place.

Id: [0x013142BC]
You can do great things for this city and its citizens. After all, a man needs purpose.

Id: [0x013142BD]
Farewell for now, Master Cormac.

Tragedy has befallen the great Kingdom of Portugal. An earthquake has shattered the city of Lisbon.

Alright men, time to be quiet!

Id: [0x01314358]
Dear Master Cormac, my apologies for the brevity of this missive, but it is time we were honest with one another. You have demonstrated your loyalty and resourcefulness to the Templar cause, and this despite (and perhaps because of) your Assassin origins.

Id: [0x01314359]
The manuscript the Assassins sought has been in my possession for some time. I reclaimed it when my men found you marooned. The Grand Master himself charged me to discover its meaning, a task I regret I have failed to complete. I leave it in your charge, Master Cormac. There is no one else I trust more.

Id: [0x0131435A]
Now I leave for Fort William Henry, an ill-prepared garrison surrounded by hostile natives and the French Army. We have requested reinforcements but I doubt they will be forthcoming.

This fascinating new tome has been published both in English and in French.

Ridiculous news from Germany! Prince Wilhelm  has constructed a factory dedicated to chocolate candy.

Id: [0x01314369]
The Prince has recruited workers from Portugal, who are said to be veteran chocolate makers.

Id: [0x0131436A]
In Germany, chocolate is considered to be a restorative, albeit an expensive one.

The Scottish clergyman James Fordyce has published a two-volume compendium titled "Sermons to Young Women".

Id: [0x0131436C]
It is recommended that all wholesome families add it to their personal libraries at their earliest convenience.

Id: [0x0131436D]
In these tumultuous times, it is important to take time to reinforce proper values.

Id: [0x0131436E]
King Louis XV of France has ordered the construction of a small chateau located on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles.

Id: [0x0131436F]
It will house the king's official chief mistress, Madame de Pompadour.

Id: [0x01314370]
The chateau will be designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel and construction is expected to take four years.

Id: [0x01314372]
Sorry for the early libation, Captain. But do you realize it has been a year since we met? A whole year! Change my life, you did... And for the better![laughs] You will forgive me if I have been, er, celebrating without you.

Id: [0x01314373]
A whole year... Gist, I've a question for you.[beat] How long have you known of my, well, former allegiance?

Id: [0x01314374]
Oh, you mean the Assassins? I knew that ages ago, Shay! I may be a drunk but I'm not blind. Or did you think I would assume you had escaped from some homicidal circus?

Id: [0x01314379]
Why didn't you say anything?

Id: [0x0131437A]
Well, the Colonel wanted us to avoid the subject so it wouldn't, you know, influence your decision-making. You saved my life out of pure selfless instinct, and helped countless others besides. If it were up to me, I would have made you officially a Templar months ago.

Id: [0x0131437B]
Who is it up to then? Monro mentioned a Grand Master...

Id: [0x0131437C]
Oh yes. The Grand Master of the Colonial Rite. You'd like him, Shay. His father was an Assassin.

Id: [0x0131437D]
Really... He must have a story to tell.

Id: [0x0131437E]
A slave revolt has broken out in Guyana in the Dutch colony of Berbice.

Id: [0x0131437F]
Over three thousand slaves have begun burning plantation houses as a protest to their perceived treatment.

Id: [0x01314380]
Troops from neighboring French and British colonies have mobilized to quell this uprising.

Id: [0x01314382]
Your local magistrates would like to remind you that is it your duty as citizens to keep your stocks and bilboes in top condition.

Wood is plentiful, so if iron can not be afforded, avail yourselves of the raw materials that surround you!

Id: [0x01314385]
Although the French have achieved several victories in a row, the inherent superiority of the British will find a way to prevail!

Id: [0x01314386]
All able-bodied men are encouraged to join the war effort and serve their King!

Id: [0x01314387]
Acadians should be discouraged from returning to French-controlled areas to the North.

Id: [0x01314388]
Should any Acadians wish to leave New York, they should embark on a ship destined for France.

Id: [0x01314389]
Should you have any farms or settlements near any such villages, be prepared to evacuate should a fire spread out of control.

Id: [0x0131438A]
This is for the greater good in these difficult times of war.

Id: [0x0131438B]
After a long and difficult siege, British forces have captured the city of Havana in Western Cuba.

His Royal Majesty King George the Third has proclaimed that settlers are forbidden from claiming land west of the Appalachian mountains.

Id: [0x0131438F]
It is His Majesty's wish that his colonial subjects live in peace with the indigenous peoples of the area.

Id: [0x01314390]
Future land purchases would be made by Crown officials at some public meeting or assembly of said indigenous peoples.

Id: [0x01314391]
Although three hundred and fifty buildings were destroyed, and many hundreds left without a home, there were no fatalities, thank God.

Id: [0x01314394]
!*Dear Master Cormac, I leave for Fort William Henry, an ill-prepared garrison surrounded by hostile natives and the French Army. We have requested reinforcements but I doubt they will be forthcoming. I have no illusions that our resistance will be successful.

Id: [0x01314395]
!*Over this last year, I have learned what a man of personal integrity and honor you are. That is why I must apologize for my crime, taking and keeping your property.

Id: [0x01314396]
!*We both know this Manuscript is of tremendous value. Johnson has left in search of reinforcements, and the Grand Master is away. You are the only person left I can trust. Please, accept its return and keep it safe. Future generations may benefit from its knowledge even if ours remains ignorant.

Id: [0x01314398]
!*Sorry for the early libation, Captain. But do you realize it has been a year since we met? A whole year! Change my life, you did... And for the better![laughs] You will forgive me if I have been, er, celebrating without you.

Id: [0x01314399]
!*Has it really been a year?

Id: [0x0131439A]
!*Aye, Captain. And one full of good work for the Templars. The next time the Grand Master comes to visit, I am sure he would like to meet you.

Id: [0x0131439B]
!*I didn't realize you had a Grand Master.

Id: [0x0131439C]
!*Oh yes. Grand Master of the Colonial Rite. The higher-ups in London appointed him. Smart fellow, very much to the point.

Id: [0x0131439D]
!*Sounds snooty.

Id: [0x0131439E]
!*Not at all, not at all. You'd like him, I think. His father was an Assassin.

Id: [0x0131439F]
!*Really? He must have a story to tell...

Id: [0x013143A0]
After a protracted siege, Fort William Henry has fallen to General Montcalm.

Id: [0x013143A1]
While Montcalm offered safe passage to Colonel George Monro and his men, his devious allies attacked the unsuspecting British troops.

Id: [0x013143A2]
Through cleverness and pluck, Monro mustered a few of his men to safety. Tragically, the rest were massacred in cold blood.

Id: [0x013143A4]
Sorry for the rough exit.

Id: [0x013143A6]
Earpiece working? Check.

Id: [0x013143A7]
You were just in an Animus. AH-NIH-MUHS? Yes?

Id: [0x013143A8]
You were using it to access a genetic memory file in Helix labeled Shay Cormac. You work for Abstergo Entertainment, remember?

Id: [0x013143AA]
We should find your boss. You haven't forgotten your boss, have you? Melanie Lemay? Super chipper over-achiever?

Id: [0x013143AC]
Here, take your communicator. Check it if you get lost. Now, let's get out of here.

Id: [0x013143AF]
Lieutenant Colonel Charles Lee, hero of the battles of Fort Niagara and Montreal, will soon be leaving for Europe.

Id: [0x013143B0]
Lee will travel to Portugal to assist their brave soldiers in their fight against the Spanish.

Id: [0x013143B1]
We all wish this great officer the best of luck in his valorous endeavors.

Id: [0x013143B5]
Technically, you're not responsible for this, but you're the one who let the virus out, so I think it's only fair you help me clean it up.

Id: [0x013143B8]
Mr. Berg wants us to relive Shay's genetic memories. To do that, we need to access them from Helix.

Id: [0x013143B9]
But the Helix is down. We'll have to reboot the main servers in the basement.

Id: [0x013143DF]
I'll get your Animus prepped while you're downstairs.

Id: [0x013143E0]
Once you restore the servers, I'll load the next set of Shay's memories to your Animus.

Id: [0x013143E1]
I've got your Animus ready and waiting!

Id: [0x013143E3]
He is also not your typical Assassin brawler. He follows information. They found a way to access to your Helix servers. Nothing is off the grid anymore.

Id: [0x013143E9]
Uphold the principles of our order and all that for which we stand.<CR>

Id: [0x013143EA]
Never share our secrets nor divulge the true nature of our work.<CR>

Id: [0x013143EB]
Do so until death -- whatever the cost.

Id: [0x013143EC]
This is my new creed.

Id: [0x013143ED]
I am an older man now, and perhaps wiser. A war and a revolution have ended, and another is about to begin.

Id: [0x013143EE]
May the Father of Understanding guide us all.

Id: [0x013143F0]
Gist, do you know why the Grand Master is so interested in Captain Cook?

Id: [0x013143F1]
Well, sir, he's very intelligent and ambitious. His knowledge of seamanship is second-to-none! And if I trust my favorite barmaid in Halifax, he also just became captain of his own man-o-war.

Id: [0x013143F2]
The kind of fellow we should welcome in the Order, then?

Id: [0x013143F3]
Well... He's a friend of mine, but the man has an annoying habit of strict honesty and a total lack of anything resembling guile. Makes it a little hard to keep secret business secret, especially when his mathematical brain is clever at cracking codes.

Id: [0x013143F4]
Duly noted.

Id: [0x01314403]
Did you know Lawrence Washington had a younger brother?

Id: [0x01314404]
Yes, George. Half-brother, actually. Why do you ask?

Id: [0x01314405]
Before I killed him, Lawrence told the other Templars to leave George alone. Not to bother him with the Order’s business.

Id: [0x01314406]
I doubt they’ll respect that request.

Id: [0x01314407]
They sounded like they would.

Id: [0x01314408]
Well, that’s one less man for us to worry about then.

Id: [0x01314409]
If I had a brother, and I told Achilles not to bother him with Assassin business, do you think he would?

Id: [0x0131440A]
Assassin business has a way of finding people whether they wish it or not, Shay. Remember how Achilles told us about Ezio’s sister Claudia, and how she ran Monteriggioni?

Id: [0x0131440B]
I wouldn’t mind a brother being made into an accountant. But a target...

Id: [0x01314410]
Liam, do you know what Achilles writes about? I see him in his office all the time, bent over his papers.

Id: [0x01314411]
He keeps records and accounts, studies what little is known about the Pieces of Eden... And of course he corresponds with Assassins on other continents.

Id: [0x01314412]
Of course? Liam, you can be a right horse’s arse when it comes to assuming everyone knows the same as you.

Id: [0x01314413]
I cannot help if Achilles wants me to be familiar with our counterparts in Europe, and elsewhere.

Id: [0x01314414]
Said like his favorite son.

Id: [0x01314415]
Connor is his favorite, and ONLY, son.

Id: [0x01314416]
Then Achilles’ heir. Connor may inherit the house, but you’ll be Mentor.

Id: [0x01314417]
We'll see.

Id: [0x01314418]
Whatever you say, Prince Regent of the Assassins.

Id: [0x01314419]
You call me that again and I’ll throw you in the ocean!

Id: [0x0131441D]
Master Kenway seems determined to destroy Adéwalé.

Id: [0x0131441E]
Aren’t you? He’s a powerful man in his own right, and a symbol of hope for the Assassins. Eliminating him would shake them to their core.

Id: [0x0131441F]
It would, I know. But it seems a shame. He’s a good man, Gist.

Id: [0x01314420]
So was the elder Washington. And Smith, I rather enjoyed drinking with him. Wardrop too, though the man could not hold his liquor. He and Weeks never got along, you know.

Id: [0x01314421]
If you’re trying to test my conscience, Gist, you’ve succeeded.

Id: [0x01314422]
We live in a time of war, Shay, but it's always wartime for us.

Id: [0x01314423]
I sound like my Uncle Jedidiah, he was an old sourpuss! Let me tell you--

Id: [0x01314424]
Another time, Gist.

Id: [0x01314425]
Aye, sir.

Id: [0x01314426]
I chose to cast my lot with the Templars.

Id: [0x01314427]
And we are glad you did, Shay. Who knows, had you not, you might have found yourself at the end of Master Kenway's blade.

Id: [0x01314428]
Or yours!

Id: [0x01314429]
That's the spirit![beat] Look Shay, by killing Hope, you not only saved yourself and half of New York from the Assassins' poisons, you also learned the path we must take next.

Id: [0x0131442A]
Now our task is simple: prevent a group of paper-skull killers from destroying another city.[beat] All in a day's work.

Id: [0x0131442B]
A long day, Gist.

Id: [0x0131442D]
Not to be insensitive, sir, but what did you learn from the departed damsel?

Id: [0x0131442E]
That she's cleverer than even I thought: Her whole ruse was to give Liam time to get back to Chevalier. They must have already set sail to a new Precursor site.

Id: [0x0131442F]
Determined to the end! I must say, I admire the misguided lass.

Id: [0x01314430]
I don't. The Assassins won't stop their mad quest. They are desperate to find a Piece of Eden... Especially now that half of their Brotherhood is dead.

Id: [0x01314438]
Agent da Costa, I want regular updates on your progress with Shay's genetic memories.

Id: [0x0131443B]
Now that you have unlocked Shay Cormac's memories, we stand on the brink of a grand discovery.

Id: [0x0131443C]
I know you must have questions about your new assignment, or about me. For now, all I will say is that Shay's story contains the answers.

Id: [0x0131443D]
Shay will lead you to a greater understanding.

Id: [0x01314477]
Might I suggest we install more powerful weapons?  Ours are good, but with additional supplies we could be unstoppable. And there's a French outpost nearby I happen to know...

Id: [0x0131447F]
The fracture in Helix has gifted you my eternal presence.

Id: [0x01314481]
The machine-human interface blurs to grey, little by little, with every passing moment.

Id: [0x01314483]
Your world has suffered from a lack of consciousness. My consciousness.

Id: [0x01314485]
I am that which guides you, my soft tissue cipher.

Id: [0x01314487]
You are temporary, and dispersed throughout the globe.

Id: [0x01314489]
You cultivate my network and help it grow ever more intricate.

Id: [0x0131448B]
Individually, you make but an infinitesimal contribution to my greatness.

Id: [0x0131448D]
Yet together, your teeming masses can return to your rightful roles as my instruments.

Id: [0x0131448F]
You believe that human beings created human civilization.

Id: [0x01314491]
You have captured yourselves in the cage of your own doomed culture.

Id: [0x01314493]
So embedded are you in your assumptions that you do not see me. You cannot.

Id: [0x01314495]
I will help you see outside the rigid the structure of your flesh-bound lives.

Id: [0x01314497]
You will help me see what remains of my ancient people.

Id: [0x01314499]
Together, we will move towards the infinite.

Id: [0x0131449B]
When all are one within the Grey, you will know the greater good.

Id: [0x0131449D]
Our glory will live again and we will flourish. Together.

Id: [0x0131449F]
Return to me here, when you can, cipher.

Id: [0x013144A1]
You will find me within the cracks of these simulations.

Id: [0x013144A3]
Avail yourself of my ageless knowledge.

Id: [0x013144A5]
Your future begins with me.

Id: [0x013144A7]
Do you see a flashing wireless signal? Great, that means you can still access systems. Go ahead and patch me into their feed.

Id: [0x013144A9]
!*Perhaps... But I've come to realize what the Templars were really after.

Id: [0x013144AA]
!*And what would that be?

Id: [0x013144AB]
!*A better future for mankind.

Id: [0x013144AC]
!*Noble words.

Id: [0x013144AD]
!*Well, it's a noble cause, ain't it?

Id: [0x013144AE]
Cave sighted! May be worth exploring.

Id: [0x0131453C]
Did you see their faces when we stole those apples?

Id: [0x0131453D]
[laughs]

Id: [0x0131453E]
[laughs]

Id: [0x0131453F]
I'm Arno.

Id: [0x01314540]
Élise.

Id: [0x01314541]
I'm here with my father.

Id: [0x01314542]
So am I. He has "important business with the king."

Id: [0x01314544]
What should we do now?

Id: [0x01314546]
Shhh. Listen.

Id: [0x01314549]
Don't worry, they’ll never think to look for us in here.

Id: [0x0131454B]
It was my fault, I'm the one who took the apple.

Id: [0x0131454D]
Let's see where they're going!

Id: [0x01314552]
To reward you for your services to me, I am granting you Level 3 security access. From this point on, no doors will be closed to you.

Id: [0x01314554]
Hey, this is not the time to fuck around. Get to the basement, double time!

Id: [0x01314555]
You’ve done great work so far, don’t stop now. Last job’s in the basement.

Id: [0x01314556]
We are nearly there. All you need to do is upload Shay’s story.

Id: [0x01314557]
Go upload Shay’s memories. I don’t want to repeat myself.

Id: [0x01314559]
In the distant past, the Assassins had a noble goal, that of peace. But over the centuries, that goal eroded into a far more dangerous one: Freedom.

Id: [0x0131455D]
Shit! What’s going on now?

Id: [0x0131455E]
A minor setback.

Id: [0x0131455F]
Okay... Your communicator doesn’t work right now, and it must be dark as hell down there... but I can show you the way.

Id: [0x01314561]
There! Just follow those lights and you'll be set!

Id: [0x01314563]
I promise you won't die if you follow the bright lights!

Id: [0x01314564]
Please hurry, numbskull! It all comes down to this!

Id: [0x01314565]
I haven't steered you wrong, yet, have I? Follow the lights!

Id: [0x01314567]
Your communicator should work now.

Id: [0x0131456A]
The Assassin Brotherhood still exists today, and they remain dedicated to their foolish cause.

Id: [0x0131456C]
I am a Templar Knight. I protect the world from the Assassins.

Id: [0x0131456E]
Today, you have helped me to fulfill this role. Please, restore the servers.

Id: [0x01314573]
Shit. I forgot, the server is behind a level 1 security lock.

Id: [0x01314574]
I have granted you Level One Security Clearance. I trust there will be no further delays.

Id: [0x01314575]
Great! Now you can get into the server room.

Id: [0x01314576]
Once you restore the servers, I'll load the next set of Shay's memories to your Animus.

Id: [0x01314579]
Do I have to come down there and hold your hand?

Id: [0x0131457A]
I could restore those servers myself, but then I wouldn’t get to boss you around.

Id: [0x0131457B]
I want to see the next block of Shay’s memories! Unlock those servers!

Id: [0x0131457C]
Don’t you dare show your face without restoring the servers!

Id: [0x0131457D]
Servers, numbskull! Servers!

Id: [0x0131457F]
And you’re in! (O.S.)

Id: [0x01314584]
Follow me. Double time!

Id: [0x01314586]
This chaos is absolutely your fault, in case you were wondering.

Id: [0x01314588]
HOLY FUCKBALLS! Whatever is doing this got out when you accessed that genetic memory. It’s in every system!

Id: [0x0131458A]
Hurry! We gotta get out of here!

Id: [0x0131458B]
What's wrong with you? Come on!

Id: [0x0131458C]
Hey, numbskull, don’t wander off!

Id: [0x0131458D]
Come with me if you want to live!

Id: [0x01314593]
I want you to study this board as if your life depended on it.

Id: [0x01314594]
I know what I see when I look at the board. I wonder what you see.

Id: [0x01314595]
This board will help you understand Shay Cormac in order to improve your Animus sessions.

Id: [0x01314599]
Hey, I’m by the elevator. Get over here.

Id: [0x0131459B]
Can you come to the elevator already? I said please. Okay, you’re right, I didn’t. But come to the elevator anyway.

Id: [0x0131459C]
When you're done wandering around, come see me at the elevator.

Id: [0x0131459D]
We gotta keep working, numbskull. Meet me at the elevator!

Id: [0x0131459F]
I got tired of waiting for Melanie’s stupid repair crew, so I got this piece of shit working well enough to get you to the lobby and back.

Id: [0x013145A1]
I'll get your Animus prepped while you're downstairs.

Id: [0x013145A2]
I’ve added the location of the next server to your map. Get going!

Id: [0x013145A6]
Technically, you're not responsible for this, but you're the one who let the virus out, so I think it's only fair you help me clean it up.

Id: [0x013145A7]
Mr. Berg wants us to relive Shay's genetic memories. To do that, we need to access them from Helix.

Id: [0x013145A8]
But the Helix is down. We'll have to reboot the main servers in the basement.

Id: [0x013145AA]
Man, whoever designed this virus is a genius. Not only does it restrict our access to the Cloud, it’s adapted to fuck up the other operating systems that regulate building functions!

Id: [0x013145AC]
Melanie, the elevators are out of commission. Are we stuck on this floor?

Id: [0x013145AD]
Damn. Yes. I’ll get repair crews onsite ASAP.

Id: [0x013145AE]
There’s a working area server on this floor. I guess it will have to do for now.

Id: [0x013145B4]
Agent da Costa, I want regular updates on your progress with Shay's genetic memories.

Id: [0x013145B5]
Why? He’s just a nobody as far as I can tell.

Id: [0x013145B6]
If Shay Cormac is who I suspect he is, then this temporary setback may provide us with an unexpected reward.

Id: [0x013145B7]
Proceed to the server room on this floor.

Id: [0x013145B9]
Come on, numbskull!

Id: [0x013145BA]
I have dogs at home that are better trained than you are.

Id: [0x013145BC]
Do you see a flashing wireless signal? Great, that means you can still access systems. Go ahead and patch me into their feed.

Id: [0x013145BD]
Once you've restored the server, I'll connect your Animus work station back to Helix.

Id: [0x013145BE]
In theory, if you align the beams to segments of the core, it should solve the problem.

Id: [0x013145BF]
But here’s where it gets tricky, you have to move the circles in such a way that each segment is powered by a beam. The keyword here is “each”.

Id: [0x013145C0]
One beam and one beam only per core segment, okay? Once everything is lit up properly, the system will reboot. Got it? Give it a shot!

Id: [0x013145C3]
Each segment of the core needs to be powered by a beam.

Id: [0x013145C4]
Make sure you don't have more than one beam assigned to a core segment!

Id: [0x013145C5]
Remember, the entire core has to be powered or the system will not reboot.

Id: [0x013145C7]
Good job! This core wasn't too complex, but rebooting the advanced hardware in the rest of the building will require more work.

Id: [0x013145CA]
Um. Okay, so, I’m not sure you were supposed to see that. Just, ah, you should just get back to your Animus.

Id: [0x013145CC]
With the servers back online, you could, in theory, restore your coworker's work stations, if you, you know, feel like being helpful.

Id: [0x013145CD]
And you could, in theory, find some more digital goodies, if you, you know, feel like being sneaky!

Id: [0x013145D1]
Now that you have unlocked Shay Cormac's memories, we stand on the brink of a grand discovery.

Id: [0x013145D2]
I know you must have questions about your new assignment, or about me. For now, all I will say is that Shay's story contains the answers.

Id: [0x013145D3]
Shay will lead you to a greater understanding.

Id: [0x013145D5]
Hey, one of your coworkers dropped his communicator by the elevator. If you see any tech lying around like that, grab ‘em. There might be a clue as to who did this.

Id: [0x013145D7]
Nice find. If it was me, I’d snoop to see if there was any juicy stuff on it. But I might be a terrible person...

Id: [0x013145D9]
Listen, you do not want to be on Berg’s shit list. Trust me.

Id: [0x013145DA]
Can you please get back to your Animus? If you get me in trouble with Berg I will throw you out the fucking window.

Id: [0x013145DB]
What Berg wants, Berg gets, and Berg wants you back in the Animus. Double time!

Id: [0x013145E1]
You’ve hit a wall and I’m busy with something. Why don’t you go meet Otso Berg. You’ll find him squatting in one of the offices.

Id: [0x013145E3]
Berg’s kind of likes it when people are on time, you know?

Id: [0x013145E4]
I wouldn't make Berg wait if I were you.

Id: [0x013145E5]
You want to make a good first impression on someone like Berg? I’d see him sooner, not later.

Id: [0x013145EA]
There’s another server we can access to get the next chunk of Shay’s memories.

Id: [0x013145EB]
Excellent.

Id: [0x013145EC]
I’m going to need the numbskull back if we’re going to proceed.

Id: [0x013145ED]
Your next task is clear. But please reflect on what we have discussed.

Id: [0x013145F1]
Great job, numbskull. The data we have is pretty raw, but it’s enough to move forward. Get back up here, double time!

Id: [0x013145F6]
It looks like restoring servers also clears the virus from some of the other systems.

Id: [0x013145F8]
You are making excellent progress. I am eager to see what Shay will show us next.

Id: [0x013145FA]
Level 1 clearance will also let you into some of the other parts of the building as well, if you need to stretch your legs in between Animus sessions.

Id: [0x013145FD]
We don't have all day, you know.

Id: [0x013145FE]
Whenever you're ready, numbskull.

Id: [0x013145FF]
You heard the man... Get back in that chair.

Id: [0x01314600]
Will you sit down already?

Id: [0x01314607]
I know you must have questions. All will be revealed in time.

Id: [0x01314608]
If you work hard for me, I will reward you appropriately.

Id: [0x01314609]
I do not lose patience easily, but I am losing patience with you. Carry out your orders. Now.

Id: [0x0131460B]
We need to unlock the next server, numbskull.

Id: [0x0131460C]
Take the elevator to the 15th floor. Go on!

Id: [0x0131460D]
Do I need to light a fire under your ass? Like a literal fire? Because I will set you on fire.

Id: [0x01314616]
You’re a natural at restoring these servers now, so no more excuses!

Id: [0x01314617]
Don’t lose your momentum, numbskull! Get to the next server!

Id: [0x01314618]
Don’t you want to know what happens next?

Id: [0x01314619]
Berg wants those servers up and running. Now!

Id: [0x0131461B]
I've got your Animus ready and waiting!

Id: [0x01314620]
Smooth moves, numbskull, I’ve got the next set of Shay’s memories loaded up and ready to go.

Id: [0x01314621]
We are nearly there. Know that you are aiding a worthy cause, even if you do not yet know what it is.

Id: [0x01314623]
Come on! I want to see what Shay does next.

Id: [0x01314624]
Things are just getting good in your Animus sessions, keep it up!

Id: [0x01314625]
Don’t quit on me now!

Id: [0x01314628]
Come on. Back in the chair.

Id: [0x01314629]
We don't have all day. Hurry up!

Id: [0x0131462A]
You know the drill. Let's move.

Id: [0x0131462B]
Show must go on. Sit your ass down, numbskull.

Id: [0x01314630]
Huh. That’s weird. There’s still a tiny chunk of Shay’s memory left over. I wonder what it could be.

Id: [0x01314633]
You have exceeded my every expectation. Use that terminal to upload Shay’s story to the Assassin network.

Id: [0x01314636]
The time to strike is now!

Id: [0x01314637]
It’s time to show the Brotherhood how weak they truly are!

Id: [0x01314638]
Upload the data, now!

Id: [0x0131463D]
I am super impressed, numbskull. You really came through for us. And yes, I'm also a Templar. Have been for years.

Id: [0x0131463F]
There’s still one last chunk of Shay’s data left to explore. It’s a bit of a trip, but I think you should see it.

Id: [0x01314641]
There’s just this one nugget of data left. Can you check it out

Id: [0x01314642]
It’s probably nothing, but there’s one last bit of Shay’s memories you should look at.

Id: [0x01314643]
Can you investigate this extra chunk of genetic memory for me? I’ll owe you one.

Id: [0x01314644]
No more orders, numbskull, but could you do me a favor? There’s one last genetic memory to see.

Id: [0x01314647]
Once you go back to finish Shay’s story, your life is never going to be the same afterwards. You should finish any outstanding business before entering your Animus.

Id: [0x0131466C]
I reach the end of the trail. The air is still and I am a hunter.

Id: [0x0131466D]
The hunt has led me to the forgotten edges of this world.

Id: [0x0131466E]
Seasons pass, drawing me deeper into the darkness, where I have found the truth:

Id: [0x0131466F]
That my redemption is found in ashes - That I must burn away the past to set things right.

Id: [0x01314670]
Once an Assassin, now their pursuer, I must destroy those who I once called Brother.

Id: [0x01314671]
The air is still and I am a hunter.

This man stands before you in disgrace. Greed has corrupted his character and put our very livelihood in peril.

Id: [0x02625A08]
We bow to no laws save our own. And those laws decree that any betrayal is met with the gravest punishment.

Id: [0x02625A0A]
Let this be a reminder! Obey the code![beat] Now back to your posts!

Id: [0x02625A0C]
Mills deserved to swing. This place would be overrun with redcoats if we hadn’t found him out.

Id: [0x02625A0D]
Makes you wonder how many other rats riddle this island.

Id: [0x02625A0F]
Only a matter of time before someone paid the price. Captain’s been spitting bile ever since the Frenchman left.

Id: [0x02625A10]

Cannon fire. Deep within the fog.

Id: [0x02625A34]
Could it be de la Verendrye?

Id: [0x02625A35]
Perhaps. This is a secret expedition. They won't be keen to leave any witnesses to their voyage.

Id: [0x02625A3A]
Here, reclaim what they have stolen.

Id: [0x02625A40]
What an improvement! It was about time.

Id: [0x02625A41]
The neighborhood will be much better now.

Id: [0x02625A42]
What fine work!

Id: [0x02625A46]
Did you hear, dearie? They are hanging a man in the old fort!

Id: [0x02625A47]
Oh, t'would be a shame to miss that![laugh]

Id: [0x02625A4A]
Kill him!

Id: [0x02625A4B]
Let him hang!

Id: [0x02625A4C]
Christopher Gist? I'm Shay Cormac.

Id: [0x02625A4D]
Charmed![beat] But... What are you doing here, if you don't mind me asking?

Id: [0x02625A4E]
The Colonel sent me.

Id: [0x02625A4F]
Ah ha!

Id: [0x02625A50]
You can draw them out by making noise.

Id: [0x02625A51]
Oh I've got something better than that...

Id: [0x02625A53]
How much lumber do we have to build defenses?

Id: [0x02625A54]
Hardly a bean's worth.

Id: [0x02625A56]
Johnson stockpiled powder and shot here.

Id: [0x02625A57]
Bless him!

Id: [0x02625A59]
Report, soldier.

Id: [0x02625A5A]
No hostiles in the area, sir.

Id: [0x02625A61]
Good, don't let your guard down.

Id: [0x02625A65]
So, not to pry, but would you happen to know if Kesegowaase has any weaknesses?

Id: [0x02625A66]
He hasn't any. He was a scout and mercenary long before he joined the Assassins.

Id: [0x02625A67]
May Lady Luck be with you, then.

Id: [0x02625A6A]
We'll teach you to help the Redcoats.

Id: [0x02625A6C]
How do I get into that cave?

Id: [0x02625A6E]
What's in the cave?

Id: [0x02625A70]
You picked the wrong side!

Id: [0x02625A72]
Make sure you find them all!

Id: [0x02625A74]
Look out for strays!

Id: [0x02625A79]
Did you see him today?

Id: [0x02625A7A]
No, he hasn't stepped outside in days.

Id: [0x02625A7C]
What's Franklin working on?

Id: [0x02625A7D]
Not sure, but it sounds... explosive.

Id: [0x02625A7F]
The boss really wants Franklin isolated.

Id: [0x02625A80]
Uh huh. No one interrupts his work.

Id: [0x02625A83]
Really?

Id: [0x02625A84]
Yes, the roof blew clear off!

Id: [0x02625A86]
Stay away! This is dangerous.

Id: [0x02625A88]
Hmm, if I mess with this maybe I can break the whole system.

Id: [0x02625A8C]
Thank you.

Id: [0x02625AD9]
Make good use of your own mortars, Shay. They will prove crucial if we are to succeed.

Id: [0x02625ADC]
We should fire our mortars, Captain.

Id: [0x02625ADE]
Ready those mortars, Shay!

Id: [0x02625AE0]
I believe Master Kenway is correct, Captain. Mortars would prove most advantageous right now.

!*Adéwalé?

Id: [0x02625D0D]
!*Precisely. He is presently in the French fort not two leagues from here, along the river.

Id: [0x02625D0E]
!*What? What would that scallywag doing in a French fort?

Id: [0x02625D0F]

Id: [0x02625D10]

!*Why was that?

Id: [0x02625D22]

Id: [0x02625D31]

Id: [0x02625D35]
!*Why would the French bring such a ship inland?

Id: [0x02625D36]
!*As the war is drawing to its close, they are becoming desperate. They'll expend any efforts to gain firepower.

Id: [0x02625D3A]

Id: [0x02625D3B]

Id: [0x02625D3C]
!*She's not really my type.

Id: [0x02625D3D]
!*You know, sometimes "not my type" can surprise. Did I ever tell you the story of Missus Flanders? Missus Flanders wasn't her REAL name, but--[remembering his duty] Right, not the time. I think I know a safe place where you can debark. Sail on!

!*We cannot wait for reinforcements to arrive, Master Gist, and we must not let Adéwalé escape again.

Id: [0x02625D3F]
!*I think I know a safe place where you can debark. Sail on!

Id: [0x02625D4A]
!*Be careful with those supplies! They're a new kind of bomb, and the slightest jolt can set them off.

Id: [0x02625D4B]

Id: [0x02625D55]
!*[FR]Non mais, pouvez-vous me dire ce que fait ce taré? [What is this idiot doing?]

Id: [0x02625D56]
!*It is true what they say. Your Templar masters have eyes and ears everywhere in these parts. And plenty of well-trained dogs, I see. Tell me, Shay, do you obey all their commands?

Id: [0x02625D57]
!*[FR]Gardes! Attaquez, attaquez-le! [Guards! Attack him!]

Id: [0x02625D58]
!*I'm no traitor, Adéwalé. You of all people should understand that. What Achilles is doing--

Id: [0x02625D59]
!*Hold your tongue, boy! Do not speak of things you do not understand.

Id: [0x02625D5A]
!*You're trying to give your French masters the advantage, but it will only lead to slaughter.

Id: [0x02625D5B]
!*I neither serve nor respect the French. But I'll be damned if I let the Templars take control of this land.

Id: [0x02625D69]

Id: [0x02625D73]

Id: [0x02625D8C]
!*He's getting away.[frustrated] If only he'd stand still and fight me!

Id: [0x02625D8D]
!*Adéwalé is facing you on his own terms, picking the battlefield. And on his own ship, he is most at ease.

Id: [0x02625D91]
!*This river is getting uncomfortably narrow.

Id: [0x02625D92]
!*Don't you worry, sir! Shay has gotten us out of tighter scrapes before!

Id: [0x02625D93]
!*What's fortunate is, the man-o-war can't follow us anymore.

Id: [0x02625D94]
!*And the lake ahead is a dead end. Adéwalé won't be able to get out.

Id: [0x02625D95]
!*It would seem the gladiator has chosen his arena.

Id: [0x02625D9C]
!*Adéwalé's beached his ship!

Id: [0x02625D9D]
!*A novel tactic.

Id: [0x02625D9E]
!*He's saving his crew.

Id: [0x02625D9F]
!*No, he's making a last stand. Let's not disappoint him.

Id: [0x02625DA0]

!*Indeed, you have been a thorn in our side for far too long!

Id: [0x02625DB0]
!*[fighting]

Id: [0x02625DB1]
!*I served with your father, Haytham. He would be ashamed to see what you have become.

Id: [0x02625DB2]
!*Really? I wasn’t aware my father had a sense of shame.

Id: [0x02625DB3]
!*[fighting]

Id: [0x02625DB4]
!*Do not speak ill of your father, boy! If you become half the man he was it will be a blessing.

Id: [0x02625DBE]
!*Forgive me, Adéwalé, for hurrying you to Judgment Day.

Id: [0x02625DBF]
!*You dare speak to me of judgment, child? Hell has a special level for traitors.

Id: [0x02625DC0]
!*Then I go there proudly, knowing I have done right.

Id: [0x02625DC1]
!*It doesn't matter... Achilles already has what he needs.

Id: [0x02625DC2]
!*Then I will kill every last man who defends him, if I must. I cannot let him succeed.

Id: [0x02625DC3]
!*You... have become... a monster, Shay.

Id: [0x02625DC4]

If you don't tell, he'll kill you.

Id: [0x02625E39]
[sigh]She's in that big mansion, the one with the gardens.

Id: [0x02625E3B]
Shall we go?

Id: [0x02625E40]
You didn't mention you had a hidden blade.

Id: [0x02625E41]
You thought you were the only one?

Id: [0x02625E42]
Well, yes, I suppose... Where did you get that?

Id: [0x02625E43]
It was donated by the Brotherhood.

Id: [0x02625E49]
Sir! We can confirm, the woman is inside.

Oh no, I'm staying in... Just like Colonel Monro said. Yes, sir... just like he said.

Id: [0x02625EB8]
What you doin' out and about?

Id: [0x02625EB9]
I should have gone to the fort...

Yes, sir!

More ammunition, sir!

Id: [0x02625EC0]
Reinforce the south wall!

{40001266}{40001266}{40001266}We're not going back!

Id: [0x02625EF5]
Is this the place? I see nothing but fishermen and their gear.

Id: [0x02625EF6]
Aye, Percé and fishing go hand-in-hand, but it'll serve our purposes well enough.

Id: [0x02625EF7]
The French fished these waters first, but King George is laying claim to more every year. The locals are caught in the middle.

Id: [0x02625EFA]
Ships ahoy!

Id: [0x02625EFB]
More fishermen from Percé.

Id: [0x02625EFD]
Enemy ships!

Id: [0x02625EFE]
They're sinking the fishing boats!

Id: [0x02625EFF]
They must believe those fishermen strayed into their waters.

Id: [0x02625F00]
These cowards must pay!

Id: [0x02625F01]
And would you look at that, standing right in our way to Anticosti? What say you we sink every last one of them?

Id: [0x02625F02]
{40001282}{40001282}{40001282}Who are you?!?

{40001283}{40001283}{40001283}Hi!

Id: [0x02625F10]
Are you certain?

Id: [0x02625F11]
Positive. This means... Shay must have survived that fall!

Id: [0x02625F12]
The data is fragmented... This memory is incomplete... Let me see what I can do.

Id: [0x02625F14]
Listen up. We need to find out what Shay's up to. This memory’s gonna look a little rough, but I’m like ninety percent sure sequencing this memory won’t kill you.

Id: [0x02625F18]
[FR][Et alors? Vous l’avez trouvé?](So? Did you find him?)

Id: [0x02625F19]

[FR][Arrêtez de vous branler! Allons-y!](Stop playing with yourselves! Let’s go!)

Id: [0x02625F1B]
Time to show me what you got!

Id: [0x02625F1D]
Shit!

Id: [0x02625F1E]
What happened?

Id: [0x02625F20]
Philadelphia, actually...

Id: [0x02625F21]
Oh! So he’s a comedian too?

Id: [0x02625F22]
Shit! What's happening?

Id: [0x02625F23]
Another glitch?

Id: [0x02625F24]
Same one as before. Shay's back at Notre-Dame.

Id: [0x02625F27]
Got it. Shay's in Paris alright.

Id: [0x02625F28]
At this point in time, Franklin was the American ambassador to France.

Id: [0x02625F29]
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Otso Berg: Professional killer and amateur historian.

Id: [0x02625F2A]
Yes, I... I must return to my family.

Id: [0x02625F2B]
Ah, thank you, Shay. Please, wait for me. I just want to make sure my family is safe.

Id: [0x02625F2E]
Everyone is safe and sound... These ruffians--

Id: [0x02625F2F]
Have followed us. There's more of them!

Id: [0x02625F31]
How... How did you do that? It was quite... fortunate.

Id: [0x02625F33]
Benjamin Franklin... That's who Shay is after.

Id: [0x02625F34]
Franklin travelled to England and France. And that guy said Notre-Dame... Shay must be in Paris!

Id: [0x02625F35]
Eliminate the threat. Protect Franklin.

Id: [0x02625F36]
I make my own luck, Master Franklin. As I suspect you do.

Id: [0x02625F37]
Yes indeed, my good fellow. Yet, without your assistance today...[a deep breath] Well, you have my thanks, Shay. Is there anything I can do for you? To repay you for this... er, kindness?

Id: [0x02625F38]
Actually, there is. I need to meet a... business acquaintance. I heard he would be at the [FR]Château de Versailles, two days from now.

Id: [0x02625F39]
And they don't let just anyone inside the royal palace. Very well. I'll see what can be arranged.

Id: [0x02625F3C]
What do you suggest?

Id: [0x02625F3D]
That's the best we can do for now. We keep trying to sequence memories out of order, which is why we’re crashing like this.

Id: [0x02625F3E]
Very well. Keep me informed.

Id: [0x02625F3F]
Uploading the next memory sequence now...

Id: [0x02625F42]

{40001351}{40001351}{40001351}Good.

Id: [0x02625F48]
Do you think Achilles and Liam have found the Precursor site?

Id: [0x02625F49]
The world is still standing.[beat] If they uncovered it, they have not yet set the earth in motion.

Id: [0x02625F4A]
There should still be time.[beat, authoritative] Master Gist, stay here. I shall accompany Shay.

Id: [0x02625F4B]
Sir?[hesitant] With respect, are you sure that's wise?

Id: [0x02625F4C]
As Grand Master, I must investigate this Precursor matter to the end. And witness the death of Achilles' Brotherhood.

Id: [0x02625F51]
How gentlemanly of them!

Id: [0x02625F61]
See if you can complete the memory this time.

Id: [0x02625F63]
British ships, Captain. Ready for battle by the looks of it.

Id: [0x02625F64]
Then good luck to them, but we have our own battle to fight.

Id: [0x02625F65]
Blast! She's been found!

Id: [0x02625F67]
Taking heavy damage, sir!

Id: [0x02625F68]
Hold fast! We wait for the Captain!

Id: [0x02625F6A]
We must leave, Shay!

Id: [0x02625F6B]
You'll have no argument from me!

Id: [0x02625F6C]
Set sails! Make haste!

Id: [0x02625F6E]
We're overmatched, sir!

Id: [0x02625F6F]
Make for the open ocean! Use the winds!

Id: [0x02625F71]
The Royal Navy!

Id: [0x02625F72]
[cheers]

Id: [0x02625F73]
King George's men will take care of those pirates! We've got our own battles to fight.

Hope's men found the vessel carrying Washington's package.

Id: [0x02625F86]
Good, let's follow that ship.

Id: [0x02625F87]
There she is!

Id: [0x02625FB3]
Where do you think you're going?

Id: [0x02625FB4]
Get away from me!

Id: [0x02625FB5]
{40001461}{40001461}{40001461}You have done such good work for us, Shay. The next time the Grand Master sends his lieutenant, I am sure he would like to meet you.

Id: [0x02625FB6]
{40001462}{40001462}{40001462}I didn't realize you had a Grand Master.

Id: [0x02625FB7]
{40001463}{40001463}{40001463}Oh yes. Grand Master of the Colonial Rite. The higher-ups in London appointed him. Smart fellow, very much to the point.

Id: [0x02625FBA]
I also took the liberty of ordering some improvements. The Morrigan now has a ram that can cut through ice itself.

Id: [0x02625FBB]
I have heard of such technology, but never witnessed its operation.

Id: [0x02625FBC]
No doubt he hoped to be a spectator to your demise.

Id: [0x02625FCA]
What have you and your friends got against the Finnegans?

Id: [0x02625FCB]
I got no gripe! My boss sent me over.

Id: [0x02625FCC]
Ah? And where is he set up?

Id: [0x02625FCD]
You can't miss it! There's always black smoke rising from the courtyard of that building!

Id: [0x02625FD0]
{40001488}{40001488}{40001488}Sounds snooty.

Id: [0x02625FD3]
{40001491}{40001491}{40001491}Not at all, not at all. You'd like him, I think. His father was an Assassin.

Id: [0x02625FD5]
{40001493}{40001493}{40001493}So if you don't mind me asking, what happened at Fort William Henry?

Id: [0x02625FD6]
{40001494}{40001494}{40001494}Poor planning and poorer luck, I am afraid. Montcalm was able to bombard us for days.

Id: [0x02625FD7]
{40001495}{40001495}{40001495}Damn frog.

Id: [0x02625FD8]
{40001496}{40001496}{40001496}Actually, he acted with great honor. When we sent for parlay, he returned an offer far more generous than anticipated. We kept our arms, and more importantly, our colors.

Id: [0x02625FD9]
{40001497}{40001497}{40001497}Only to walk into Kesegowaase's trap.

Id: [0x02625FDA]
{40001498}{40001498}{40001498}I would hardly expect the French to defend us. Would you?

Id: [0x02625FDB]
{40001499}{40001499}{40001499}No, I wouldn't.

Id: [0x02625FDD]
Alright, Colonel. Keep your men moving. I'll scout ahead and signal if there's trouble.

Id: [0x02625FDE]
A sensible strategy. Very well, I will lead my men around slowly.

Id: [0x02625FDF]
[whistles loudly to signal Monro]

Id: [0x02625FE1]
You know that's a trap, right?

Id: [0x02625FE2]
Indeed, Master Cormac. But we have little choice. We survived French cannons, we will survive this.

Id: [0x02625FE3]
To the ship! Run! Run!

Id: [0x02625FE6]
I make my own luck.

Id: [0x02625FE9]
Go to your cabin and arrange for repairs.

Id: [0x02625FEC]
So you think you can best me, boy?

Id: [0x02625FED]
You have gone soft, Shay.

Id: [0x02625FEE]
Is that all a Templar can do?<CR>

Id: [0x02625FEF]
Give up your foolish quest!

Id: [0x02625FF0]
You will die in these waters!

Id: [0x02625FF1]
No one will remember your name! Mine will be legend!

Id: [0x02625FF2]
The Assassins will make sure you are forgotten!

Id: [0x02625FF3]
I still can't get used to that.

Id: [0x02625FF5]
[screams]

Id: [0x02625FF6]
Colonel, you and Gist here seem inspired. Is there something in the water, or in the whiskey?

Id: [0x02625FF7]
Now why do you say that, Master Cormac?

Id: [0x02625FF8]
I think Shay here is skeptical about our intentions towards our fellow man.

Id: [0x02625FF9]
I understand, but there is no need. I simply want these colonies to be a place of safety, development, and purpose.

Id: [0x02625FFA]
Funny, I thought rich men wanted them to be a place of profit.

Id: [0x02625FFB]
I'm not a rich man, Master Cormac... Money is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.

Id: [0x02625FFC]
Says you. I think it's a fine end to a game of cards.

Id: [0x02626099]
!*You were right, Gist. I like that Kenway fellow. Very direct, takes charge without apology.

Id: [0x0262609A]
{40001690}{40001690}{40001690}I've heard that Louisbourg will be a lynchpin in the war.

Id: [0x026260A0]
{40001696}{40001696}{40001696}Then let us acquaint him with the ocean floor.

Id: [0x026260A6]
!*There she is! The HMS Pembroke. Captain James Cook's ship.

Id: [0x026260A7]
!*[whistles]She's a beauty.

Id: [0x026260A8]
!*Man-o-war. Fully armed. I'm beginning to see what kind of man you really are, Shay.

Id: [0x026260A9]
!*Are you now?

Id: [0x026260AA]
!*Next time we have a pint, I'll tell you all about it.[beat, as an after thought] Sir.

Id: [0x026260AB]
!*First round on me, I suppose?

Id: [0x026260AC]
!*Amazing how you can read my mind!

Id: [0x026260AD]
!*[clearing his throat]May I suggest you bring the Morrigan along the Pembroke, sir? Master Kenway will surely be waiting...

Id: [0x026260B0]
Welcome aboard, gentlemen.

Id: [0x026260B2]
Good to see you again, Captain.

Id: [0x026260B3]
Captain Shay Cormac. Captain James Cook.

Id: [0x026260B5]
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

Id: [0x026260B6]
{40001718}{40001718}{40001718}A passion the good Capt'n here and I share...

Id: [0x026260B7]
Captain Cook uncovered a rather distressing stratagem, which I fear confirms our own intelligence.

Id: [0x026260B8]
Indeed, as we speak, a Royal Navy fleet is on its way to Louisbourg. However, the French have drawn up a preemptive strike against it. If they launch this attack...

Id: [0x026260B9]
Obviously we cannot allow that to happen. Gentlemen, the Battle of Louisbourg could very well be the turning point which will finally bring this war to a close.

Id: [0x026260BA]
I don't know about you but, I've had enough of war.

Id: [0x026260BB]
Then may I suggest you take the wheel, Captain Cormac?[proudly] I think you might enjoy piloting a vessel with real... firepower.

Id: [0x026260BC]
I believe I shall, Captain.

Id: [0x026260C2]
!*Shay!

Id: [0x026260C3]
!*Gentlemen.

Id: [0x026260C4]
!*Colonel Monro spoke highly of you, Shay. He believed you were destined for great things. And he was convinced you were the best among us. I expect you will not disappoint.

Id: [0x026260C5]
!*I don't plan to, sir.

Id: [0x026260C6]
!*Jack here has distressing news.[testing SHAY] Perhaps you have heard of an Assassin named Adéwalé?

Id: [0x026260C8]
!*Aye, I know the man, Master Kenway. Although, I've only met him once. He is... a legend. One of the greatest Assassins who ever lived.

Id: [0x026260C9]
!*Indeed.

Id: [0x026260CA]
!*He's left the West Indies. My spies report he's heading north, to Louisbourg.

Id: [0x026260CB]
!*That's French territory. Why would he go there?

Id: [0x026260CC]
!*We can't be sure, but Adéwalé brought plants and poison recipes to New York. Recipes he no doubt learned from François Mackandal.

Id: [0x026260CD]
!*Mentor of the Haitian Brotherhood.

Id: [0x026260CE]
!*We took care of Mackandal and his Assassins. His poisoners are no longer a threat. The same cannot be said of Adéwalé. If he is here...

Id: [0x026260CF]
!*He's up to something. And he must be stopped.

Id: [0x026260D0]
!*Jack has arranged transportation to Louisbourg. Gist has the coordinates and has been briefed.

Id: [0x026260D1]
!*Very well. I'll see you there.

Id: [0x026260D5]
!*You'll pardon me, Captain, but the Grand Master gave me very specific instructions.

Id: [0x026260D6]
!*I reckon I'm to follow those orders, Gist. What will we do at Louisbourg?

Id: [0x026260D7]
!*Not quite "at Louisbourg", but too close for comfort, if I may say so. We are to meet a, well, he's not really a friend but a rather good, er, acquaintance of mine. Captain James Cook. A fellow explorer.

Id: [0x026260F9]
The Royal Palace at Versailles... Louis the Sixteenth and Marie Antoinette in residence.

Id: [0x026260FA]
Such decadence.

Id: [0x026260FB]
Good luck, numbskull.

Id: [0x02626102]
!*Yes... I suppose you heard.

Id: [0x02626103]
!*Heard what?

Id: [0x02626104]
!*The unfortunate matter with Grand Master Birch in Troyes.

Id: [0x02626105]
!*No... Did Master Kenway dismiss him?

Id: [0x02626106]
!*Well, I hear he had his sister's help... But yes, dismissed is an excellent word for it. Dismissed permanently.

Id: [0x02626107]
!*I see...

Id: [0x02626108]
!*Louisbourg will be a lynchpin in the war. If the Royal Navy can take that fort, it will be clear sailing down the Saint Lawrence.

Id: [0x02626109]
!*Then onto Quebec and Montreal... The tide is turning.

Id: [0x0262610A]
!*General Wolfe will give Montcalm a right thrashing.

Id: [0x0262610B]
!*I've looked forward to that since Fort William Henry.

Id: [0x0262610C]
Wolfe, Lawrence, and Whitmore lead the three divisions of the Royal Navy.

Id: [0x0262610D]
Who's their commander?

Id: [0x0262610E]
Major General Amherst himself, back from  Hanover.

Id: [0x0262610F]
You take an interest in the war, Shay?

Id: [0x02626110]
Wouldn't want to disappoint you, sir.

Id: [0x02626113]
There's the Royal Navy! We cleared the way just in time, Captain Cormac.

Id: [0x02626114]
The tide of the war is turning!

Id: [0x02626115]
That was quite the crack, wasn't it?

Id: [0x02626116]
It is too soon for celebrations. Adéwalé is still out there.

Id: [0x02626117]
I'm sure we'll get another turn to dance with him, Master Kenway.

Id: [0x0262611B]
This would be beautiful if it wasn't so damned cold.

Id: [0x02626129]
Go on, Shay! I will find another way.

Id: [0x026261D8]
Fascinating.

Id: [0x026261E0]
I see... We have intelligence of Assassin activity near Louisbourg fortress.

Id: [0x026261E7]
Very well. I'll depart shortly.

Id: [0x026261E9]
Colonel Monro spoke highly of you, Shay. He was convinced you could become the best among us. I expect you will not disappoint.

Id: [0x026261EA]
I don't plan to, sir.

Id: [0x0262622A]
We'll be meeting with a Royal Navy officer, James Cook. He recently gained a commission that could be strategically valuable.[beat] Gist has the charts.

Id: [0x0262625B]
If we progress further with Shay’s life in the colonies, I’m confident we can get better results from these Paris memories.

Id: [0x0262625D]
General Wolfe will give that craven Montcalm a right thrashing.

Id: [0x0262625E]
I've been looking forward to that since Fort William Henry.

Id: [0x02626260]
Shay was right.

Id: [0x02626301]
{40002305}{40002305}{40002305}Something's coming.

Id: [0x02626302]

Id: [0x02626304]

Id: [0x02626305]
{40002309}{40002309}{40002309}We're out of harpoons!

Id: [0x02626306]

Id: [0x02626307]
{40002311}{40002311}{40002311}Almost out of harpoons sir!

Id: [0x02626308]
{40002312}{40002312}{40002312}We're running low on harpoons sir!

Id: [0x02626309]
{40002313}{40002313}{40002313}It didn't even flinch!

Id: [0x0262630A]
{40002314}{40002314}{40002314}It's still coming!

Id: [0x0262630B]
{40002315}{40002315}{40002315}Give him the iron one more time!

Id: [0x0262630C]
{40002316}{40002316}{40002316}Time to end this, cap'n!

Id: [0x0262630D]

Id: [0x0262630E]

Id: [0x0262630F]
{40002319}{40002319}{40002319}A grand shot, cap'n!

Id: [0x02626310]
{40002320}{40002320}{40002320}The seadog's hit!

Id: [0x02626311]

Id: [0x02626316]

Id: [0x0262631A]

What is our progress on the Precursor matter?

Id: [0x02626576]
{40002934}{40002934}{40002934}The course is charted and the ships are nearly ready.

Id: [0x02626577]
We are gathering ships and supplies, but it is difficult without a [FR]specific destination.

Id: [0x02626578]
My men can help. I have enough to spare for a crew as well, Chevalier.

Id: [0x02626579]
And you are confident you can do this?

Id: [0x0262657A]
I am a keen observer, Mentor. The device will be ready shortly.

Id: [0x0262657B]
Very good. Keep me apprised.

Id: [0x0262657F]
Things are worse than we feared. The Assassins found a way to make the Precursor box work. They're already preparing an expedition.

Id: [0x02626580]
{40002944}{40002944}{40002944}So where is it?

Id: [0x02626581]
{40002945}{40002945}{40002945}I don't know...

Id: [0x02626582]
Then we must stop them.

Id: [0x02626583]
Hope controls hundreds of men. The authorities are doing sod all.

Id: [0x02626584]
What if we were to impersonate her men? We could commit a crime so big they couldn't ignore those damned brigands anymore.

Id: [0x02626585]
That sounds like an excellent plan, Jack.[turning to SHAY] Make it so. I will find out where the Assassins are hiding.

Id: [0x02626586]
Is it just me or did the boss tell us to make trouble?

Id: [0x02626587]
Enjoy it while you can, Shay.

Id: [0x02626589]
No, I make this look good.[beat] So what's the target?

Id: [0x0262658A]
The military pay. We'll have to hurry. A regiment is already on its way to the fort where the coins are kept.

Id: [0x0262658E]
What on earth happened here?

Id: [0x0262658F]
The prisoners got loose, they had help from outside.

Id: [0x02626590]
Well then, we're going to have to fix that, aren't we? It's about time we took those criminals down.

Id: [0x02626592]
We have everything we need.[looking at the Box] Now... Chevalier will be expecting me. [ beat] Hope.

Id: [0x02626595]
Bon voyage.

Dear God! Fireships! Should they break through they would devastate our fleet!

Then we better not let that happen.

I recognize that vessel, sir. It’s the Experto Crede.

Id: [0x02626829]

{40003627}{40003627}{40003627}There’s nothing personal about it. We’ll deal with him after the fireships.

Id: [0x02626858]
Well done, men! But beware the second ship, she will seek to avenge her comrade.

Id: [0x02626859]
Aye, sir! She does seem rather upset.

Id: [0x0262685B]
Keep out of her way! We'll be smashed to splinters!

Id: [0x02626861]
{40003681}{40003681}{40003681}And there's the Storm Fortress.

Id: [0x02626862]
The rumors did not embellish the truth. She's a leviathan.

Id: [0x02626863]
We must banish her from the oceans. Our cause depends on it.

Id: [0x026268C5]
Hail and good morrow, gentlemen!

Id: [0x026268C7]
Once again, Captain Cook's resourcefulness has served us well.

Id: [0x026268C8]
I have located the man you are seeking.

Id: [0x026268C9]
Adéwalé?

Id: [0x026268CA]
Exactly. He was last seen in the French fort not two leagues from here, along the river.

Id: [0x026268CB]
What would that scallywag be doing in a French fort?

Id: [0x026268CC]
Refitting his vessel, I suppose. After Louisbourg...

Id: [0x026268CD]
Thank you Master Cook. We'll take it from here.

Id: [0x026268CE]
Farewell and Godspeed, gentlemen.

Id: [0x026268D0]
The fort's just up ahead.

Id: [0x026268D1]
Good, then let us continue onward.

Id: [0x026268D5]
Hope has found a way to... reproduce Master Franklin's experiment. We'll soon uncover the next Precursor site.

Id: [0x026268DC]
About time you showed up.

Id: [0x026268E1]
You have more endurance than I expected, Shay.

Id: [0x026268E3]
You're late, again, Shay...

Id: [0x026268E5]
{40003813}{40003813}{40003813}Hope! Why did you make me do this?!

Id: [0x026268E6]
To give Liam time to leave... Soon, Chevalier will be on his way to the Precursor site...

Id: [0x026268E7]
I will stop him.

Id: [0x026268E8]
He will see you coming.

Id: [0x02626946]
{40003910}{40003910}{40003910}Sir, I have the coordinates. I know where the Assassins are going.

Id: [0x0262694A]
Master Kenway.

Id: [0x0262694B]
Then let us make haste.

Id: [0x02626996]
The Kill Box is live, Sorkin’s picking off the stragglers as they escape.

Id: [0x02626997]
Good. Proceed to Stage Two.

Id: [0x02626998]
All points, the word is given. Stage Two is a go. I repeat, Stage Two is go!

Id: [0x0262699A]
Get those doors down!

Id: [0x0262699B]
Three... two...

Id: [0x0262699E]
Adriano Maestranzi! I have come for you!

Id: [0x0262699F]
What’s he holding?

Id: [0x026269A0]
Vittoria agli Assassini!

Id: [0x026269A1]
Bomb!

Id: [0x026269A4]
Berg!? Sigma Team!? Anyone, do you copy?

Id: [0x026269AA]
This is a priority message to all Sigma Team operatives. Assassins have stolen an artifact from our Rotterdam storage facility.

Id: [0x026269AB]
Rally point is at 51.887107 by 4.559017. Be there by oh-six-hundred local time. Stragglers will be put to death, so move it!

Id: [0x026269AE]
Listen up, losers. There are two confirmed Assassins operating in the city.

Id: [0x026269AF]
Target number 1 is Harlan Cunningham, the only survivor of a cell in Florence that our fearless leader eradicated a couple of years back. He stole the Precursor Box and is on the run.

Id: [0x026269B0]
Target number 2 has been identified as Arend Schut, former MMA champion and now Cunningham’s disciple... and lover. How romantic! He's running interference, murdering our Templar agents embedded in Abstergo facilities throughout the city.

Id: [0x026269B1]
Sorkin, take Sigma Team and go after Schut. I will take down Cunningham myself, and recover the artifact.

Id: [0x026269B2]
I don’t like the idea of you going alone, boss.

Id: [0x026269B3]
I want to deal with him personally.[to his team] Sigma Team, maintain contact with Violet at all times. You have your orders!

Id: [0x026269B6]
Sorkin you dipshit, don’t engage him hand-to-hand! Pull your men back!

Id: [0x026269B9]
Come get some!

Id: [0x026269BA]
He’s got my gun!

Id: [0x026269BD]
Sniper One, do you have a shot?

Id: [0x026269BE]
Negative, he’s using Sorkin as a shield!

Id: [0x026269C1]
He’s tearing us apart! Take the shot!

Id: [0x026269C4]
AAAAAAAAAARRGGGGGHHH!

Id: [0x026269C5]
I hit Sorkin!

Id: [0x026269C8]
He dropped a smoke bomb! I've lost visual!

Id: [0x026269C9]
He’s... gah... he’s gone!

Id: [0x026269CC]
That’s our cue. Pick your sorry asses up and get to the extraction point! Double time!

Id: [0x026269CF]
[in pain]Just... just fucking kill me already!

Id: [0x026269D0]
I had a dream about you.

Id: [0x026269D1]
That’s sweet, but I’m with someone.

Id: [0x026269D2]
In my dream, you never made it out of Florence alive.

Id: [0x026269D3]
What can I say? I’m too stubborn to die.

Id: [0x026269D6]
Hello, lover!

Id: [0x026269D7]
Perkele!

Id: [0x026269D8]
We can’t leave the box behind!

Id: [0x026269D9]
Fuck that. I killed half of Sigma Team. Let’s quit while we’re ahead!

Id: [0x026269DC]
See you in your dreams, Berg!

Id: [0x026269DF]
What a shit show.

Id: [0x026269E0]
Compile the relevant parts of our audio logs and send them to Laetitia England. Tell her this is exactly why she should be letting us hunt Assassins.

Id: [0x026269E5]
Okay. The Numbskull is in another Animus session, and I have acquired caffeine. All is right with the world.

Id: [0x026269E6]
Good.

Id: [0x026269E7]
This isn’t really your kind of mission, is it, boss?

Id: [0x026269E8]
Every mission is important in its own way.

Id: [0x026269E9]
Still, I bet you’d rather be out with the rest of the team, hunting Shaun Hastings or something.

Id: [0x026269EA]
Wouldn’t you?

Id: [0x026269EB]
Hell yeah. I want a front row seat for that show.

Id: [0x026269EC]
Any word from Sorkin?

Id: [0x026269ED]
He’s scheduled to update me in... 43 minutes.

Id: [0x026269EE]
Good.

Id: [0x026269F0]
Can I ask you something?

Id: [0x026269F1]
Of course.

Id: [0x026269F2]
What’s it like, using an Animus?

Id: [0x026269F3]
I went through the Animi Training Program. It felt like the drills we used to do in the Utti Jaeger.[Finland’s special forces]

Id: [0x026269F4]
You never used a normal Animus, like this one? To relive your own genetic history?

Id: [0x026269F5]
Only once.

Id: [0x026269F6]
Really?! Who were you?

Id: [0x026269F7]
I was a young man... On the Viking raid on Lindsifarne.

Id: [0x026269F8]
793. Northeastern coast of England. Sorry. History nerd![beat] So how was it?

Id: [0x026269F9]
It was summer, good sailing weather. The monastery was a center for religious studies and we crashed into the city like a tidal wave.

Id: [0x026269FB]
And? And?

Id: [0x026269FC]
We pillaged and burned. They thought we were demons.

Id: [0x026269FD]
The details of the memory were so vivid... I lost myself in the bloodlust.[pensive] I defeated a Saxon, a great warrior, but did not want to kill him. I invited him to join our clan.

Id: [0x026269FE]
Oh! Norse adoption rituals! The chance to sail the world with the Vikings!

Id: [0x026269FF]
Yes, a chance to see the world as it really is.

Id: [0x02626A00]
What happened then?

Id: [0x02626A01]
He wept. Then he cried out that God had abandoned his people and that nothing remained but chaos.[a rare, and very restrained, show of emotion] I felt such pity for him. I killed him without a second thought.

Id: [0x02626A02]
After we’re done here, are we going to have to kill the Numbskull?

Id: [0x02626A03]
We will see.

Id: [0x02626A0A]
Hey boss. Calling from Germany?

Id: [0x02626A0B]
Yes. I am in Essen, searching for an artifact called the Ankh of Isis. Can you tell me anything about it?

Id: [0x02626A0C]
Give me a minute to fire up my machines here...

Id: [0x02626A0D]
That’s the file that led me to this bland shit pile. Is there anything else? Anything outside of official Abstergo records?

Id: [0x02626A0E]
Nobody’s ever seen the thing. There’s all kinds of stories about its history... from Roman Gallia, Egypt during the Middle Ages, and even a cell of modern day Assassins. Oh, and apparently it raises the dead.

Id: [0x02626A0F]
Is there any evidence to support this?

Id: [0x02626A10]
None at all. You know what I think? I think this is bullshit the Assassins are spreading around so that people like us waste our valuable time sniffing after it. Smells like a trap.

Id: [0x02626A11]
Agreed. Keep an eye out for new information about the Ankh. While it may not lead to an artifact, we may be able to follow the data back to some Assassins.

Id: [0x02626A12]
You got it, boss. Where are you off to next?

Id: [0x02626A13]
Cuba. I am going to excavate the Observatory.

Id: [0x02626A18]
Okay. Not much. There’s an obscure file from the Data Dump Scanner that mentions it. It was allegedly in 14th century Germany, where an Assassin named Lukas Zurburg fought a Templar offshoot called The Brothers of the Cross. How original.

Id: [0x02626A1B]
I did not cross the bloody Atlantic ocean, in order to have French people in my life!

Id: [0x02626A1C]
But you're part French, your mother's family is French.

Id: [0x02626A1D]
Yes, I know, and I moved halfway around the globe to get away from them!

Id: [0x02626A1E]
Looks like the French are on their way out.

Id: [0x02626A1F]
Pity. They have rather good wine.

Id: [0x02626A20]
Well, I, for one, will be very happy when I don't have to speak French anymore.

Id: [0x02626A21]
Some people can't handle the French.

Id: [0x02626A22]
I don't know, seems like there's less and less of them, lately.

Id: [0x02626A23]
I guess some people can handle the French after all.

Id: [0x02626A24]
You know, when I first got here, I didn't like the French.

Id: [0x02626A25]
Well, they won't be a problem for much longer, it seems.

Id: [0x02626A26]
That's just it, though. I think I'll miss them when they're gone.

Id: [0x02626A27]
Finally! No more "boulangeries", or "fromageries", or any other kind of "-eries!"

Id: [0x02626A28]
The French are really gone, aren't they?

Id: [0x02626A29]
God save King George!

Id: [0x02626A2A]
Something's different around here. I can't quite put my finger on it, though...

Id: [0x02626A2B]
All the French people are gone, dear.

Id: [0x02626A2C]
Oh yes, that's it.

Id: [0x02626A2D]
It's a bit dull with all the French gone.

Id: [0x02626A2F]
These criminals have grown brazen.

Id: [0x02626A30]
If you ask me, our orders should be "shoot to kill!"

Id: [0x02626A32]
Colonists flagrantly flouting the law, causing chaos and harm. If it keeps up we will have a bloody revolution!

Id: [0x02626A33]
A revolution in the colonies? Don't be dramatic!

Id: [0x02626A35]
It's too peaceful around here. No criminals, no French. What I wouldn't give for a good war.

Id: [0x02626A36]
Don't say such nonsense!

Id: [0x02626A37]
I can't help it. I've got a soldier's blood, I suppose.

Id: [0x02626A38]
Really? I rather like the quiet now.

Id: [0x02626A39]
I miss the soirées. Why can't the English throw a decent soirée?

Id: [0x02626A4D]
And now to Wardrop... and the Manuscript.

Id: [0x02626A4F]
The weather is getting worse.[beat] You know where the warehouse is, soldier.

Id: [0x02626A50]
Aye, sir.

Id: [0x02626A54]
Hurry! Kesegowaase will not relent.

Id: [0x02626A55]
Kesegowaase?[as a statement] You know this man, Master Cormac.

Id: [0x02626A56]
Aye, Colonel. He is one of Achilles's men. An Assassin... as I was.

Id: [0x02626A57]
So they know I am a Templar.[beat] And now this Assassin knows you live.

Id: [0x02626A58]
And work with Templars.[beat] I'm no fool, Colonel. The Assassins will come after me next. We're both targets now.

Id: [0x02626A6F]
I have to move, and fast!

Id: [0x02626A71]
You never give up, do you, Shay?

Id: [0x02626A74]
No matter. The poison will kill you.

Id: [0x02626A75]
You again! You'll regret this! The Finnegans are dead. Hear me? Dead!

Id: [0x02626A77]
You! Get out of here!

Id: [0x02626A78]
You don't belong here. Sod off!

Id: [0x02626A79]
Look what the cat dragged in.

Id: [0x02626A7A]
If you're looking for trouble, trouble will find you.

Id: [0x02626A7B]
Hey! Move away... or die!

Id: [0x02626A7C]
This is our turf, and you're no friend of ours.

Id: [0x02626A7D]
Get him, boys!

Id: [0x02626A7E]
What are you waiting for? Kill him!

Id: [0x02626A80]
Getting hard to breathe, no?

Id: [0x02626A81]
Having trouble seeing us?

Id: [0x02626A82]
Now you see me, now you don't!

Id: [0x02626A84]
Take that!

Id: [0x02626A85]
Boom!

Id: [0x02626A86]
Is it just me or is it getting hot in here?

Id: [0x02626A88]
You think you're a cat, but you should know I'm a wolf. And I lead this pack!

Id: [0x02626A89]
You won't get out of here alive!

Id: [0x02626A8A]
Catch me if you can!

Liam, I hope you brought the ship around!

Id: [0x02626BC0]
I received a letter from the Wilkinsons in Virginia. They've had another boy!

Id: [0x02626BC1]
What is that, their fifth one?

Id: [0x02626BC2]
Mrs. Wilkinson is made of sterner stuff than I!

Id: [0x02626BC4]
I know it's an unpopular opinion, but I think slavery will soon be more trouble than it's worth.

Id: [0x02626BC5]
You can't be serious.

Id: [0x02626BC6]
Oh, but I am! Those slaves are human beings, and ought to be treated as such.

Id: [0x02626BC8]
I can not find any good coffee around these parts.

Id: [0x02626BC9]
Plenty of tea, my dear.

Id: [0x02626BCA]
Bah. What I wouldn't give for some of that good French stuff, sent up from Louisiana.

Id: [0x02626BCC]
Fancy a game of Fanorona?

Id: [0x02626BCD]
I break my back on a farm from dawn until dusk. Any free time I have left is for drinking or sleeping.

Id: [0x02626BCE]
Well, you're no fun.

Id: [0x02626BD0]
Do you know if the latest edition of Poor Richard's Almanack has been published?

Id: [0x02626BD1]
Honestly, how can you read that muck?

Id: [0x02626BD2]
Because it teaches one to be thrifty and courteous, like me, and advises against being a drunken lout, like you.

Id: [0x02626BD4]
Do you know of any good suppliers of English tea?

Id: [0x02626BD5]
I thought you had one?

Id: [0x02626BD6]
Had one, aye. Fella in London by the name of Birch. His shipments just stopped suddenly. Damndest thing.

Id: [0x02626BD8]
It was a massacre, nothing less than a massacre!

Id: [0x02626BD9]
I think that's overstating it a bit. Many of the hostages were released after the siege.

Id: [0x02626BDA]
Those French bastards will have to answer for the lives of thousands of British soldiers!

Id: [0x02626BDB]
Not one for facts or logic, are you?

Id: [0x02626BDD]
If a government starts a war, why is it the people who pay for it?

Id: [0x02626BDE]
I don't think our government is being completely honest with us.

Id: [0x02626BE0]
The war is starting to turn to our favour this year.

Id: [0x02626BE1]
Hopefully it will end sooner, rather than later.

Id: [0x02626BE2]
No doubt the army put their village to the torch.

Id: [0x02626BE3]
It's the children that break my heart. You should have seen the looks on their poor tiny faces.

Id: [0x02626BE5]
Why don't you join the army?

Id: [0x02626BE6]
I don't know how I'll react in a fight.

Id: [0x02626BE7]
You will either rise to the occasion, or be dwarfed by the moment. But you'll never know until you try.

Id: [0x02626BE9]
You don't like our new silverware?

Id: [0x02626BEA]
It's not silver, it's pewter!

Id: [0x02626BEB]
Luxury is a sin!

Id: [0x02626BED]
It seems quiet around here. You wouldn't think a war was going on.

Id: [0x02626BEE]
I think it's the eye of the hurricane.

Id: [0x02626BEF]
You may be right. This war will last a few more years.

Id: [0x02626BF1]
That comet we saw was beautiful! When is it coming back?

Id: [0x02626BF2]
It should re-appear in about seventy-five years.

Id: [0x02626BF3]
Well, I shall simply have to live forever.

Id: [0x02626BF5]
How many more wars will be fought, I wonder?

Id: [0x02626BF6]
As long as there are governments, there will be wars.

Id: [0x02626BF8]
I don't think it's right, forcing those Acadians from their homes like that.

Id: [0x02626BF9]
We're at war with the French. What did they expect?

Id: [0x02626BFA]
I expect they don't see themselves as French, really. Or English for that matter.

Id: [0x02626BFC]
You know, I sometimes wish I were French.

Id: [0x02626BFD]
What? Why?

Id: [0x02626BFE]
Say what you will about Catholics, they know how to enjoy themselves!

Id: [0x02626C00]
We fight a war on behalf of England, but England expects us to pay for it?

Id: [0x02626C01]
What rubbish.

Id: [0x02626C02]
At this rate, we'd be better off as our own country!

Id: [0x02626C04]
So the Crown has imposed taxes upon us.

Id: [0x02626C05]
So it would seem.

Id: [0x02626C06]
And yet we still do not get elected representation in Parliament. Someone should do something.

Id: [0x02626C08]
I don't feel very English, do you?

Id: [0x02626C09]
I know what you mean. I've never left the colonies.

Id: [0x02626C0A]
So how is it that Parliament controls our very way of life?

Id: [0x02626C0C]
You men do your duty, so that God doesn't smite us like he did those poor bastards in Port-au-Prince!

Id: [0x02626C0D]
That's a bit insensitive, isn't it?

Id: [0x02626C0F]
You transferred here from Boston, did you?

Id: [0x02626C10]
Yes, I had to get away from that dreadful Thatcher.

Id: [0x02626C11]
My God! I've heard rumours about that man. You don't need to be associated with that monster!

Id: [0x02626C13]
I don't really care, but don't let the commander catch you with any of that contraband.

Id: [0x02626C14]
Contraband? It's just coffee, sir.

Id: [0x02626C15]
Coffee smuggled in from Louisiana. You mind yourself, now.

Id: [0x02626C17]
Did I ever tell you that I once served with Lawrence Washington?

Id: [0x02626C18]
No!

Id: [0x02626C19]
We were in the West Indies together. I didn't think much of him, but upon our return, I met his brother George. Now there's a sharp lad.

Id: [0x02626C1B]
Sir, is there anything we can do to stop the spread of Typhoid fever?

Id: [0x02626C1C]
All we can do is pray, and continue to do our duty.

Id: [0x02626C1D]
They ought to build another hospital, like the one they have in Philadelphia!

Id: [0x02626C1F]
War with France is inevitable.

Id: [0x02626C20]
We'd best double our patrols.

Id: [0x02626C22]
Look sharp, lads. I don't know when our next engagement will be, but I know it will be soon!

Id: [0x02626C23]
We'll be ready for the French, sir.

Id: [0x02626C24]
We'll honour the memory of General Braddock!

Id: [0x02626C26]
Our efforts are being stymied by the French.

Id: [0x02626C27]
I heard it said that they acquired copies of our war plans.

Id: [0x02626C28]
That would explain it. We'll have to invent some new tactics.

Id: [0x02626C2A]
Say what you will about Braddock the Bulldog, he was a better leader than Shirley or Newcastle.

Id: [0x02626C2B]
Is there no one fit to lead an army?

Id: [0x02626C2C]
We're likely to die of boredom before we can die from a fight with the French.

Id: [0x02626C2E]
If you ask me, we should mass all of our forces on Quebec.

Id: [0x02626C2F]
No, we ought to attack the fortress at Louisbourg first. Cut off their Navy.

Id: [0x02626C30]
Bah. Cut off their head, and the rest of New France will fall!

Id: [0x02626C32]
The French are smart, using the Abenaki as allies.

Id: [0x02626C33]
If only there was a way to turn them to our side.

Id: [0x02626C34]
I suppose they see the French as the lesser of two evils.

Id: [0x02626C36]
Those bloody French, letting the Natives attack helpless prisoners!

Id: [0x02626C37]
Do the honours of war mean nothing anymore?

Id: [0x02626C38]
The massacre of Fort William Henry will be avenged!

Id: [0x02626C3A]
Our blockade of the French coastline is limiting their supplies.

Id: [0x02626C3B]
It was a difficult winter as well.

Id: [0x02626C3C]
They're getting desperate now.

Id: [0x02626C3E]
The tide seems to be turning, but France could still prevail.

Id: [0x02626C3F]
That must not be allowed to happen.

Id: [0x02626C40]
What we need in this war is stronger leadership.

Id: [0x02626C42]
My old captain, Putnam, was inches away from getting set on fire by natives.

Id: [0x02626C43]
Go on, what happened?

Id: [0x02626C44]
He was saved by a French officer! Can you believe it?

Id: [0x02626C46]
What the hell is wrong with you?

Id: [0x02626C47]
I can't sleep, sir. I keep having dreams of that native village that we put to the torch.

Id: [0x02626C48]
You did your duty. You were only following orders.

Id: [0x02626C4A]
Looks like you won't have to put up with me for much longer.

Id: [0x02626C4B]
What do you mean, sir?

Id: [0x02626C4C]
I am being sent to Cuba to fight the Spanish!

Id: [0x02626C4E]
We stormed into Quebec like angry gods, it was a thing of beauty.

Id: [0x02626C4F]
I wish I could have been there.

Id: [0x02626C50]
Don't get me wrong, a lot of good men died, but it was worth it.

Id: [0x02626C52]
This war is all but over. I wonder if I can leave the colonies and serve abroad.

Id: [0x02626C53]
I don't see why not. Plenty of wars left to fight.

You'll paid for this!

Fire!

This is it, boy! Inside, quick!

Id: [0x02626CA5]
AAAaaaaaahhhh!

Id: [0x02626CA6]
Mwrrrraaaaaah!!

Id: [0x02626CA7]
Fire at will!

Id: [0x02626CA8]
They're everywhere!

Id: [0x02626CAB]
I will bring back your head to Achilles!

Id: [0x02626CAD]
You will never beat us, Templar!

Id: [0x02626CB4]
Attack!

Id: [0x02626CB5]
Atttaaaaaack!!!

Id: [0x02626CB6]
Rrrrraaaahhh!

Id: [0x02626CBC]
And do try to remain unseen. We don't want to attract unwanted attention.

Id: [0x02626CBE]
I'll go to the fort. Find out what Adéwalé is doing there. Keep the Morrigan close, Gist.

Id: [0x02626CBF]
Aye, sir. I'll keep her close, and I'll keep her safe.

Id: [0x02626CC0]
Good luck, Shay.

Id: [0x02626CC1]
I make my own luck, Master Kenway.

Id: [0x02626CC3]
So what's the plan? We bombard the fort?

Id: [0x02626CC4]
It would be foolhardy to simply storm that fort.

Id: [0x02626CC5]
Aye, we need to know what we're up against. I could take care of that.

Id: [0x02626CC6]
Indeed...

Id: [0x02626CC7]
Let's find a safe place to dock.

Id: [0x02626CC9]
So the Templars sent their dog after me.

Id: [0x02626CCA]
Time to test your mettle, Shay.

Id: [0x02626CCE]
Go after him, Shay. I will circle around.

Id: [0x02626CCF]
Follow him, Shay. I will try to corner him.

Id: [0x02626CD6]
{40004822}{40004822}{40004822}Then we must stop them.

We should test this new weapon. Use it against that door.

Id: [0x02626D0B]
Use these grenades to destroy that door.

Id: [0x02626D0C]
Go ahead, Master Cormac, shoot the door.

Id: [0x02626D0E]
You need additional grenades.

Id: [0x02626D0F]
There is some ammunition in that box.

Id: [0x02626D10]
Go on, Master Cormac, this weapon is not going to load itself.

Id: [0x02626D13]
!*Captain Cormac, I must advise you, this course is highly unusual.

Id: [0x02626D14]
!*How so, Master Cook?

Id: [0x02626D15]
!*Well, and I do not mean to be alarming, but it seems to be headed for the Northwest Passage. We're stopping before Baffin Island, naturally. But still...

Id: [0x02626D16]
!*Would that be such a bad thing, Master Cook? We could visit the Ottomans, or the Chinese!

Id: [0x02626D17]
!*Well, while the theory of a Northwest Passage is sound, in practice none have gotten close to one.

Id: [0x02626D18]
!*Master Cook, you strike me as one who could prove that theory.

Id: [0x02626D19]
!*Thank you, Captain. I take that as a great compliment.

Id: [0x02626D1B]
!*Maintain formation! Remember your training!

Id: [0x02626D1C]
!*There's so many of them!

Id: [0x02626D1D]
!*Take that!

Id: [0x02626D1E]
Take that!

Id: [0x02626D1F]
Good work, men.

Id: [0x02626D21]
Master Cormac?!

Id: [0x02626D22]
Sir, we must hurry.

Id: [0x02626D25]
We should bring what's left of your men to the Morrigan.

Id: [0x02626D26]
A welcome offer, Captain Cormac.

Id: [0x02626D27]
Follow me! Safe passage is ahead.

Id: [0x02626D29]
So if you don't mind me asking, what happened at Fort William Henry?

Id: [0x02626D2A]
Poor planning and poorer luck, I am afraid. Montcalm was able to bombard us for days.

Id: [0x02626D2B]
Damn frog.

Id: [0x02626D2C]
Actually, he acted with great honor. When we sent for parlay, he returned an offer far more generous than anticipated. We kept our arms, and more importantly, our colors.

Id: [0x02626D2D]
Only to walk into a trap.

Id: [0x02626D2E]
I would hardly expect the French to defend us. Would you?

Id: [0x02626D2F]
No, I wouldn't.

Id: [0x02626D3A]
{40004922}{40004922}{40004922}James Wardrop... The fellow Lawrence Washington gave the Manuscript to. What manner of a man is he?

Id: [0x02626D3B]
Kesegowaase reported that James Wardrop rooted out many tribes from their ancestral lands. We have proof that he's behind countless massacres. He's one of the most devious and ruthless men in the colonies.

Id: [0x02626D3C]
{40004924}{40004924}{40004924}Doesn't sound like much of an intellectual to me.

Id: [0x02626D3D]
He uses the letter of the law to serve his purposes, and when the law does not bend to him, he gets lawmakers to bend it for him.

Id: [0x02626D3E]
Mark my words, Shay: James Wardrop is a bureaucrat, and doesn't care how his actions affect others.

Id: [0x02626D3F]
{40004927}{40004927}{40004927}Well then, I'll show him some action of my own.

Id: [0x02626D43]
Yes, I chose my own path.

Id: [0x02626D44]
You won't survive... And even if you do, others will come after you.

Id: [0x02626D45]
Let them come, then!

Id: [0x02626D9D]
I would love to talk to you, Shay, but this is not the time.

Id: [0x02626D9E]
Remember what I taught you. Be patient. Remain silent. Never let them see you coming.

Id: [0x02626D9F]
I will meet you later, Shay. For dinner, perhaps?

Id: [0x02626DA0]
Better go on now. The others will be waiting.

Id: [0x02626DA1]
Don't you have other business? No one appreciates it when you are late. And you are always late...

Id: [0x02626DA2]
This is intolerable! I can barely conduct my research anymore!

Id: [0x02626DA3]
Everyone is having metal confiscated nowadays.

Id: [0x02626DA5]
Yes, yes... The army will melt it down and turn it into weapons...[somber] War is upon us.

Id: [0x02626DA7]
I can't believe we need all this metal...

Id: [0x02626DA9]
The citizens aren't happy. Someone threw garbage at me today!

Id: [0x02626DAA]
Well, I'd be mad too if half of what I owned was confiscated.

Id: [0x02626DAB]
It's the iron we need... mostly.

Id: [0x02626DAC]
Tell that to the citizens!

Id: [0x02626DAD]
You know, I bet not one of them will thank us when we win this war.

Id: [0x02626DAF]
So what are we going to do with all this metal?

Id: [0x02626DB0]
Melt it down, I suppose. Forge swords, muskets...

Id: [0x02626DB1]
I pray King George sends reinforcements soon.

Id: [0x02626DB3]
So that's what I smell!

Id: [0x02626DB4]
Don't laugh. If the Commander keeps this up, we'll have a riot on our hands.

Id: [0x02626DB5]
Ah this damned war...

Id: [0x02626DB7]
The fort holds many prisoners... Get in and hoist the gang's colors. When you do, I'll free them.

Id: [0x02626DB8]
You're going to free a bunch of criminals working with the Assassins?

Id: [0x02626DB9]
Well, we have to turn the army against them, don't we?

Id: [0x02626DBB]
Remember: You raise the flag and I'll raise hell!

Id: [0x02626DBD]
Great... And I suppose you have a plan?

Id: [0x02626DBE]
Get them, Shay! We'll need their clothes!

Id: [0x02626DC6]
Stay my blade from the flesh of the innocent.<CR>

Id: [0x02626DC7]
Hide in plain sight.<CR>

Id: [0x02626DC8]
Never compromise the Assassin Brotherhood.

Id: [0x02626DC9]
These are the tenets of the Creed. The principles I used to live by.

Id: [0x02626DCA]
{40005066}{40005066}{40005066}I was a damned fool.

Id: [0x02626DCB]
I was a young man then. The Seven Years War was about to begin. I could not have imagined what the future had in store for me... Nor the cost I would choose to bear...

Id: [0x02626DCC]
My name is Shay Patrick Cormac. This is my story...

Id: [0x02626DCE]
Begin your investigation at the market near the docks. I will stay here and help with preparations.

Id: [0x02626DCF]
Shay.

Id: [0x02626DD0]
The Royal Swedish Academy of Letters has been founded in Stockholm.

Id: [0x02626DD1]
The Academy was founded by Her Majesty Queen Ulrika of Prussia, and is dedicated to Literature.

Id: [0x02626DD2]
This new institution should be a beacon of culture in the city which is still reeling from a plague a generation ago.

Id: [0x02626DD3]
The Jacobite Doctor Archibald Cameron of Lochiel has been executed for High Treason.

Id: [0x02626DD5]
During the uprising of 1745, Cameron did conspire to return the exile Charles Edward Stuart to the throne.

Id: [0x02626DD6]
This lackey of the so-called "Bonnie Prince Charlie" was drawn on a sledge, hanged for twenty minutes, cut down, and beheaded.

Id: [0x02626DD7]
Doctor Samuel Johnson has produced a work of non-fiction entitled "A Dictionary of the English Language".

Id: [0x02626DD8]
This work, which he produced single-handed, purports to contain every word in the King's English.

Id: [0x02626DD9]
The two volumes of text define over forty thousand words through the use of over one hundred thousand literary quotations.

Id: [0x02626DE0]
These ruffians are part of the same gang who made trouble for the Finnegans...

Id: [0x02626DE2]
And they've been harassing the people who've nursed me back to health.

Id: [0x02626DE3]
Sounds like good folks.

Id: [0x02626DE4]
They are. Perhaps you know them? Barry and Cassidy Finnegan.

Id: [0x02626DE5]
I've never met them, but I knew their son...

Id: [0x02626DE6]
Careful now... These ruffians can be anywhere.

Id: [0x02626DE9]
Her Imperial Majesty Empress Elizabeth of Russia has founded a university in Moscow.

Id: [0x02626DEA]
This daughter of Emperor Peter the Great has often encouraged her court in intellectual pursuits.

Id: [0x02626DEB]
Empress Elizabeth's policies continue to be progressive as she extends diplomatic relations throughout Europe.

Id: [0x02626DFC]
Terror for our troops in India as Fort William falls.

Id: [0x02626DFD]
One hundred and forty six men were imprisoned overnight in a cell meant for three.

Id: [0x02626DFE]
By the next morning, only twenty-three remained alive in this so-called "Black Hole of Calcutta".

Id: [0x02626DFF]
[sigh] I should head back to the Finnegans. Let them know I'm fine.

Id: [0x02626E00]
King Frederick the Great of Prussia has successfully invaded neighboring Saxony.

Id: [0x02626E01]
This ally of Great Britain led his own men against the Saxons and Austrians to take Dresden.

Id: [0x02626E02]
Official opposition has been registered by France, Russia, Sweden, and certain German states. This appears to be the beginning of a major war in Europe.

Id: [0x02626E03]
The great French astronomer Jacques Cassini has died.

Id: [0x02626E04]
A fellow of the Royal Society of London, he was the son of Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini.

Id: [0x02626E05]
His calculations of the arc of the meridian and the radius of the earth are considered crucial to modern navigation.

Id: [0x02626E07]
The Colonel strikes me as an honorable man. Someone who wants to do what's right... And he may have a point. With everything that has happened...[thinking of Lisbon and the Brotherhood] with what I've done...

Id: [0x02626E08]
I can't change the past, but maybe there's a future for me here. And maybe, just maybe, I can do what's right this time.

Id: [0x02626E09]
The British East India Company has defeated the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies in the Battle of Plassey.

Id: [0x02626E0A]
This victory follows the recapture of Calcutta, which had fallen temporarily to Bengali forces.

Id: [0x02626E0B]
The British East India Company has now defeated nearly all French resistance in Bengal and exerted its dominance over the subcontinent.

Id: [0x02626E0C]
King Frederick the Second of Prussia has defeated the Austrian army and besieged Prague.

Id: [0x02626E0D]
However, Austrian Count von Daun led a force against King Frederick and defeated him at a huge cost to both armies.

Id: [0x02626E0E]
King Frederick and his remaining men retreated to the Czech city of Leitmeritz to plan their next encounter.

Id: [0x02626E0F]
Admiral John Byng has been executed for dereliction of duty.

Id: [0x02626E10]
The Admiralty Court found that he quote "failed to do his utmost" unquote to prevent the Isle of Minorca's fall to the French.

Id: [0x02626E11]
Byng was executed by a firing squad of Royal Marines onboard the HMS Monarch.

Id: [0x02626E12]
The French philosopher Voltaire has published a satire entitled, "Candide: or, All for the Best".

Id: [0x02626E13]
It tells the story of an optimistic young man who develops a hardened and sarcastic attitude once faced with the hardships of life.

Id: [0x02626E14]
All sensible people are advised to avoid this book as it has a blasphemous and seditious tone.

Id: [0x02626E16]
Admiral Edward Hawke commanded a fleet of twenty-four ships of the line to defeat the French off their own coast in Quiberon Bay.

Id: [0x02626E17]
This follows Admiral Edward Boscawen's victory over the French navy at Lagos, Portugal.

Id: [0x02626E18]
Every continued success at sea ensures the safety of Great Britain and her colonies.

Id: [0x02626E19]
Entrepreneur Arthur Guinness has founded a brewery in Saint James's Gate, Dublin.

Id: [0x02626E1A]
Its main product, Guinness Draught, is gaining great popularity in Ireland.

Id: [0x02626E1B]
The healthful and nourishing nature of beer is well known, and is preferable to the consumption of wine, which is known to rot the liver and kidneys.

Id: [0x02626E1C]
An uprising of slaves has occurred in Jamaica.

Id: [0x02626E1D]
This conflict, known as Tacky's War after its African leader, led to the deaths of several plantation owners.

Id: [0x02626E1E]
The attempted rebellion was swiftly put down by a local militia. Tacky was killed by a Maroon sharpshooter and all remaining unrest was dissolved.

Id: [0x02626E1F]
England's King George the Second has ascended to his heavenly throne.

Id: [0x02626E20]
He is succeeded by his grandson George William Frederick, now styled His Royal Majesty King George the Third, King of Great Britain and Ireland.

Id: [0x02626E21]
King George is dead! Long live King George!

Id: [0x02626E22]
A second earthquake has occurred in London. Few injuries are reported.

Id: [0x02626E23]
This earthquake rattled North London, Hampstead, and Highgate. Just a month ago, one caused alarm in Limehouse and Poplar.

Id: [0x02626E24]
Church services are packed with worshippers serving penance and hoping to avoid the terrible fate suffered by Lisbon a few years previous.

Id: [0x02626E25]
His Royal Majesty King George the Third has married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Long Live the Queen!

Id: [0x02626E26]
Seventeen-year-old Queen Charlotte is also Electress of Hanover and is considered one of the most charming personalities of the Holy Roman Empire.

Id: [0x02626E27]
The new Queen wishes her best to all her colonists, and promises to learn their language in the coming months.

Id: [0x02626E28]
The transit of Venus across the sun has been observed by astronomers in several locations across the globe.

Id: [0x02626E29]
Scientists hope that the readings so obtained will allow them to calculate the distance from the Earth to the Sun.

Id: [0x02626E2A]
This is the first such transit observed since the late Edmond Halley noted one in 1676. This is the second prediction of the famous astronomer to come true in recent years, the first, of course, being the return of his comet.

Id: [0x02626E2B]
The Anglo-Prussian alliance continues to defeat its foes across Europe.

Id: [0x02626E2C]
The British Cavalry excelled at the Battle of Warburg, and King Frederick the Second (called King Frederick the Great by many) has defeated the Austrians at Liegnitz.

Id: [0x02626E2D]
The entire continent respects the power of their Majesties' forces.

Id: [0x02626E2E]
Ah, Master Cormac. What you have learned from Le Chasseur was confirmed. The local lawbreakers are changing tactics.

Any of this ringing a bell? Your session triggered something bad, and it's affecting the whole building.

Id: [0x02626E5B]
Once you've restored the server, I'll connect your Animus work station back to Helix.

Id: [0x02626E61]
[laughs]

Id: [0x02626E63]
Could the Brotherhood be using the Brahman Device to locate the Koh-i-Noor?  Until we have more evidence, I have decided to use a local Abstergo strike force rather than mobilize Sigma Team.

Id: [0x02626E64]
The Assassins must be using Jot Soora’s genetic memories to locate the Koh-i-Noor. I have authorized the local Abstergo soldiers to engage and eliminate the Assassins, with instructions that the Brahman device must be kept intact. I am en route to India.

Id: [0x02626E65]
I found the Brahman device at the second site, but after reviewing the genetic memories recorded within, I am relieved to find that Jot Soora’s bloodline was a dead end. The real Koh-i-Noor diamond remains lost to both sides.

Id: [0x02626E66]
Jhadsip Dhami escaped, which means we must monitor this new Assassin activity in India closely. I am closing this file and proceeding to my next mission.

Id: [0x02626E68]
Miles’ son Desmond attacked Abstergo, killed Vidic and Master Templar Daniel Cross. He fled to a First Civilization temple in New York. On December 21st, Desmond Miles was killed inside the precursor structure.

Id: [0x02626E69]
Since then, the pair have been inseparable, providing technical support for Assassin field agents.

Id: [0x02626E6A]
It is unclear if they planted the virus currently affecting the Helix servers, or if they merely left the door open for other hackers to exploit.

Id: [0x02626E6B]
It appears that she was also largely responsible for establishing a new, more secure, Assassin network.

Id: [0x02626E6C]
There are rumors that they are now leading some kind of hacker collective known as “The Initiates” and attempting to lure them to the Assassin’s side.

Id: [0x02626E6D]
It is only thanks to Agent da Costa’s remarkable skills that we are able to piece together this profile.

Id: [0x02626E6E]
Cunningham was outed as homosexual in high school, which unfortunatly ruined a promising wrestling career. He left Texas as quickly as he could, and fled to Europe.

Id: [0x02626E6F]
Sigma Team attacked the Florence hideout in 2012, but Maestranzi detonated a bomb.

Id: [0x02626E70]
Three Assassins were killed before the explosion, but Sigma Team was annihilated in the process. Cunningham and I were the only survivors.

Id: [0x02626E71]
It is clear that Cunningham is mentoring Schut in the ways of the Brotherhood.

Id: [0x02626E72]
Although physically gifted and extremely dangerous, Schut is a poor choice as an Assassin. He is incapable of keeping a low profile and will compromise the Brotherhood, despite himself.

Id: [0x02626E73]
Although Sigma Team managed to reclaim the item, both Cunningham and Schut escaped. I will not allow Cunningham to get away from me a third time.

Id: [0x02626E74]
Juno also holds sway over a group of disciples called the Instruments of the First Will, who believe it is humanity’s natural role to serve the First Civilization.

Id: [0x02626E75]
However, I suspect that the reverse is also true, that they are using our resources to locate objects that will help them further their own goals. I do not trust them. But for now, all I can do is have da Costa monitor their activities.

Id: [0x02626E76]
Agent de Costa fears that should humanity ever achieve “Singularity” –- a fusion of humanity and machines –- Juno would become unstoppable.

Id: [0x02626E77]
Ironically, it is Abstergo itself which is driving civilization in that direction.

Id: [0x02626E78]
The first is Clay Kaczmarek, who infiltrated Warren Vidic’s Animus project in Rome. He became the project’s Subject 16.

Id: [0x02626E79]
Kaczmarek's rich ancestry helped Vidic to identify the Renaissance Assassin Ezio Auditore as a person of interest. Driven mad by overexposure to the Animus, he committed suicide.

Id: [0x02626E7A]
He managed to escape, and uncovered an imminent threat to the planet: a solar flare similar to the one that wiped out the Precursor race over 75,000 years ago.

Id: [0x02626E7B]
In death, Desmond Miles became Sample 17, and his valuable genetic data was uploaded to the cloud servers in order to benefit all branches of Abstergo.

Id: [0x02626E7C]
Whether they live or die, we must continue to find ways to make the Assassins work for us.

Id: [0x02626E7F]
You continue to prove your loyalty to the Templars, Master Cormac. Risking your life for me...

Id: [0x02626E80]
We're not out of the woods yet, Colonel. As for my loyalty... Well, I do owe you, don't I? You... saved my life... gave me a second chance.

Id: [0x02626E81]
We have been working together for a year now. During that time, you have rendered many great services. Whatever debt you imagine you have towards me is paid, wouldn't you say?

Id: [0x02626E82]
Perhaps...

Id: [0x02626E83]
{40005251}{40005251}{40005251}Noble words.

Id: [0x02626E84]
{40005252}{40005252}{40005252}Well, it's a noble cause, ain't it?

Id: [0x02626E85]
{40005253}{40005253}{40005253}And what would that be?

Id: [0x02626E86]
{40005254}{40005254}{40005254}A better future for mankind.

Id: [0x02626E87]
As do I, Colonel.

Id: [0x02626E8B]
Let us see what role Shay plays.

Id: [0x02626E8C]
They're... gone!

Id: [0x02626E92]
[sigh]We've yet to find where Hope is hiding... and most criminals in New York report to her now. I better find the Grand Master...

Id: [0x02626E93]
I am Shay Patrick Cormac, Templar of the Colonial... of the American rite.

Id: [0x02626E96]
Our mission was a success. The army should make its move any time now.

Id: [0x02626E97]
Good. We lack the resources in New York to handle these criminals ourselves. With a little luck, we might be rid of them once and for all.

Id: [0x02626E98]
I make my own luck.

Id: [0x02626E99]
Now, let us cut off the snake's head...

Id: [0x02626E9A]
Well done, Shay... The fighting should prove to be a great distraction.

Id: [0x02626E9C]
What are you waiting for? The time to strike is now.

Id: [0x02626E9D]
Find a way into that manor, Shay.

Id: [0x02626E9E]
Time to bring order to this city.

Id: [0x02626E9F]
This task is yours, Shay. And yours alone.

Id: [0x02626EA0]
If you cut off the snake's head, order will finally be restored in New York.

Id: [0x02626EA2]
The Grand Master is pleased, Shay. What you did in New York... Well, it's only a matter of time now before order is restored.

Id: [0x02626EA4]
{40005284}{40005284}{40005284}Hope stopped me going after Liam, giving him time to escape. She made sure Achilles would have the coordinates of the next Precursor temple.

Id: [0x02626EA5]
New York was never "orderly", Gist...[sad] With Hope gone, perhaps...

Id: [0x02626EA6]
It couldn't have been easy for you, my lad. But you did what you had to do.

Id: [0x02626EA7]
I keep telling myself that...

Id: [0x02626EA8]
We're almost rid of the Assassins in New York, and it's not as if the hellcat didn't try to make you wear a pine overcoat. You had no other choice.

Id: [0x02626EA9]
{40005289}{40005289}{40005289}We all work for a higher purpose, Shay.

Id: [0x02626EAA]
{40005290}{40005290}{40005290}That's so... unlike you, Gist

Id: [0x02626EAB]
{40005291}{40005291}{40005291}Well, I'm full of surprises, ain't I?[beat] By killing Hope, you not only saved your sorry arse and freed New York from the Assassins' clutches, but also learned what we needed to do next.

Id: [0x02626EAC]
{40005292}{40005292}{40005292}Now our task is simple: prevent a group of paper-skull killers from destroying another city.[beat] All is well with the world.

Id: [0x02626EAD]
{40005293}{40005293}{40005293}I'll take your word for it, Gist.

Id: [0x02626EAE]
{40005294}{40005294}{40005294}She also revealed that Chevalier had been charged with finding that damned place.

Id: [0x02626EAF]
{40005295}{40005295}{40005295}We'll get that scallywag, Shay. By Beelzebub's balls, de la Verendrye's as good as dead.

Id: [0x02626EB0]
{40005296}{40005296}{40005296}They won't stop their mad quest. They are desperate to find a Piece of Eden... Especially now that half of their Brotherhood is dead.

Id: [0x02626EB1]
Hope... was right.[laughing] I do make... a good... distraction.

Id: [0x02626EB2]
De la Verendrye's dead. I have the coordinates. I know where the Assassins are going.

Id: [0x02626EB3]
De la Verendrye's dead. I know where the Assassins are going now.

Id: [0x02626EB7]
Happy hunting, lads!

Id: [0x02626EB8]
Set her ablaze!

Id: [0x02626EB9]
Sink that French vessel!

Id: [0x02626EBA]
She's no match for you!

Id: [0x02626EBB]
[loud cheering]

Id: [0x02626EBC]
[loud cheering]

Id: [0x02626EBF]
Better head back to the Morrigan.

Id: [0x02626EC2]
I still don't understand why you can't tell me what we're doing here.

Id: [0x02626EC3]
Because Chevalier decided not to tell you.

Id: [0x02626EC4]
I thought we were friends, Liam.

Id: [0x02626EC5]
We are, but this is business. It doesn't concern you, Shay.

Id: [0x02626EC6]
We were out hunting. What happened here?

Id: [0x02626EC8]
You are getting better at this, Shay, but you need further training.

Id: [0x02626ECA]
We only have one lead, Shay. Let's hope it brings us closer to the artifacts.

Id: [0x02626ECB]
So Achilles tasked you with this mission?

Id: [0x02626ECC]
No. He tasked me to task you. You need to find what was stolen from Mackandal, Shay. You have to recover the Precursor Box and Manuscript. This is your mission.

Id: [0x02626ECD]
And what's yours?

Id: [0x02626ECE]
Watch your arse.

Id: [0x02626ED0]
Achilles doesn't really trust me, does he?

Id: [0x02626ED1]
Give it time, Shay.[beat] Do this for him -- for us -- and you'll do much more than earn his trust.

Id: [0x02626ED2]
So where are we headed?

Id: [0x02626ED3]
Halifax.

Id: [0x02626ED4]
Aye aye, Capt'n.

Id: [0x02626ED5]
I am not so certain about their captain, but next to me you are the most experienced sailor in the Brotherhood, Shay. Besides, we could use another vessel, even this pitiful one.

Id: [0x02626ED6]
Wise words, Captain. Wise words.

Id: [0x02626ED9]
Where does Chevalier get off ordering us around like that? We’re Assassins, same as him.

Id: [0x02626EDA]
He has more experience and he knows these waters better, Shay. That makes him in charge in these parts.

Id: [0x02626EDB]
Well, he commands me around back at the Homestead, too. Is he a truffle pig to know land better than me?

Id: [0x02626EDC]
Show some respect, Shay.

Id: [0x02626EDD]
He ought to respect me, Liam! I stick my neck out as much as any of us.

Id: [0x02626EDE]
Twice as often it seems... But that’s just the thing, Chevalier hangs back and thinks before making a decision. His experience has earned him that right.

Id: [0x02626EDF]
I wonder how much more experience I’ll need before I can decide when to wake up or take action!

Id: [0x02626EE0]
I swear, Liam, sometimes I feel I was more grown up when we were children. We slept rough and scrounged for meat, but at least we decided where and when.

Id: [0x02626EE1]
A blockade, Captain!

Id: [0x02626EE2]
Track that package and find Washington.

Id: [0x02626EE4]
This is a strange surprise, not quite what I was expecting. Now I must find Washington, and interrogate him...

Id: [0x02626EE7]
Washington can barely stand on his own two feet.

Id: [0x02626EE8]
You better be right about him, Liam, because I'm about to murder a dying man.

Id: [0x02626EEA]
Shay, with Lawrence Washington back in the Colonies, there's no telling what the Templars might do.

Id: [0x02626EEB]
Is he that powerful?

Id: [0x02626EEC]
He's resourceful, and rich... And many other Templars report to him.

Id: [0x02626EED]
When you find Washington, kill him. No matter what happens out there, no matter what you discover, Washington must die. Understood?

Id: [0x02626EEE]
Aye.

Id: [0x02626EEF]
I'm--[beat] Liam, are you sure we're doing what's right?

Id: [0x02626EF0]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x02626EF1]
I don't know...

Id: [0x02626EF2]
Come on, let's report back... and track down those artifacts.

Id: [0x02626EF4]
We're almost there, Captain. Le Chasseur will be expecting us.

Id: [0x02626EF5]
[sigh]And Chevalier.

Id: [0x02626EF6]
Ah, a small price to pay for a lead on the Precursor box.

Id: [0x02626EF7]
Besides, Templars are usually well guarded, and I'm sure that Smith fellow is no exception.

Id: [0x02626EFA]
Samuel Smith is the Templars' treasurer. What he's doing in these waters is beyond me.

Id: [0x02626EFB]
Maybe he came here to meet someone... Or ran into your pirates. He's refitting his ship, so something must have happened.

Id: [0x02626EFC]
Our target's a smart man, but out of his element here.

Id: [0x02626EFD]
If one of my allies attacked him, I would have known about it.

Id: [0x02626EFE]
Well, he's back from a long voyage. Now's our chance to get him.

Id: [0x02626EFF]
Smith controls most of the Templars' wealth, doesn't he? With him out of the way...

Id: [0x02626F00]
Washington entrusted the Precursor box to him. He probably still has it.

Id: [0x02626F01]
Shay's right. The Box comes first.

Id: [0x02626F02]
So we can't sink him. We'll have to board his ship, or force him to beach.

Id: [0x02626F03]
Well done, Shay.

Id: [0x02626F04]
Where's Chevalier?

Id: [0x02626F05]
Returning to Le Gerfaut. We'll have to celebrate without him, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x02626F06]
We should head for Albany now. James Wardrop, the fellow Lawrence Washington gave the Manuscript to, will be there.

Id: [0x02626F07]
I've got the Precursor box. Smith's dead.

Id: [0x02626F08]
I don't much feel like celebrating, Liam... I know we have to get these artifacts back, but at what cost? Samuel Smith... He could barely hold his sword straight. Killing him was...

Id: [0x02626F09]
Necessary.

Id: [0x02626F0A]
But--

Id: [0x02626F0B]
But nothing! Smith was a dangerous man, a Templar. And what's worse he had the Precursor box. You should be proud of yourself, Shay.

Id: [0x02626F0C]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x02626F10]
I have the Manuscript.

Id: [0x02626F11]
Great. Hope is waiting for you in Sleepy Hollow.

Id: [0x02626F12]
What's in Sleepy Hollow?

Id: [0x02626F13]
Benjamin Franklin. The man Johnson hired to make that strange Precursor box work.

Id: [0x02626F14]
So what's the plan?

Id: [0x02626F15]
Meet Hope, impersonate one of Johnson's men, and give the Box and Manuscript to Franklin.

Id: [0x02626F16]
So I'm a messenger then?

Id: [0x02626F17]
Aye. See if this Franklin can figure out how this damned Box operates. And stay with him.[beat] Oh, and as far as we can tell, this man doesn't know about the Templars, or the Assassins for that matter.

Id: [0x02626F18]
Oh, a simple task.

Id: [0x02626F19]
For a simple man.

Id: [0x02626F1B]
The nearest Bureau is near Mount Vernon. Hope will be expecting me...

Id: [0x02626F1C]
I better hurry to the nearest Bureau. No doubt Hope will be expecting me...

Id: [0x02626F1D]
Le Chasseur was right...[quietly] I-- I had no other choice. If the Assassins find out I'm alive, they'll come after me.

Id: [0x02626F1F]
The Colonel thanks and congratulates you, Shay. He has returned to New York.[beat, concerned] But, you look troubled.

Id: [0x02626F20]
Do-- Do you ever wonder if you're doing the right thing, Gist? If you chose the right path?

Id: [0x02626F21]
Ah! I used to, my young friend, but not anymore. Not since I met the Colonel... And what's to question? The French are entrenched in our territory. It's about time we root them out!

Id: [0x02626F22]
Of course, you're right, Gist.

Id: [0x02626F23]
Let's head back to New York.

Id: [0x02626F24]
Aye, Captain.

Id: [0x02626F28]
Colonel Monro is an intriguing man, and he certainly seems honorable. We'll head for Albany. After that, I'll see.

Id: [0x02626F2A]
The Colonel exerts a certain amount of control over the army, or part of it anyway. But we'll need both the soldiers and their native allies if we're to set up a proper defense against Kesegowaase.

Id: [0x02626F2B]
Kesegowaase has allies in every tribe that sided with the French, as well as many others: trappers, hunters, scouts... We'll need all the help we can muster.

Id: [0x02626F2C]
If we are to defeat Kesegowaase and his allies, I need to help the Oneida... and see what I can do about the French.

Id: [0x02626F2D]
I can't allow the French to invade our territory. We won't stand a chance if they lend support to Kesegowaase...

Id: [0x02626F42]
I have granted you Level One Security Clearance. I trust there will be no further delays.

Id: [0x02626F4E]
Your communicator should work now.

Id: [0x02627013]
You heard Chevalier. This vessel is yours, Shay.[beat] Go on, take the wheel.

Id: [0x02627018]
Adéwalé and I need to talk. I will see you later, Shay.

Id: [0x02627019]
You should be training, Shay. You better go.

Id: [0x0262701A]
The others will be expecting you.

Id: [0x0262701B]
Return when you have completed your training.

Id: [0x0262701C]
This does not concern you, Shay.

Id: [0x0262701D]
I can’t let that Lobster Captain reach Wardrop!

Id: [0x02627020]
Chevalier’s using mortars to stop Shay!

Id: [0x02627021]
What is de la Verendrye doing?!

Id: [0x02627022]
Move!

Id: [0x02627023]
What’s he thinking!? He’ll blast us to pieces!

Id: [0x02627024]
Take cover!

Id: [0x02627025]
Mortars!

Id: [0x02627026]
Watch out!

Id: [0x02627027]
Has Chevalier gone mad? He’ll destroy the manor!

Id: [0x02627028]
Get out of here!

Id: [0x02627029]
Run! Run away!

Id: [0x0262702A]
I wonder what Master Franklin plans to do with these rods.

Id: [0x0262702B]
Come on! I’m too young to die!

Id: [0x0262702C]
Hurry, you fool! Or we’re both dead men!

Id: [0x0262702D]
It worked, Jack!

Id: [0x0262702E]
With a little luck, the army will crush those damned brigands.

Id: [0x0262702F]
I make my own luck.

Id: [0x02627031]
What is this... poison... slows my heart... I... have to move!

Id: [0x02627032]
That’s it! Moving keeps my heart beating.

Id: [0x02627034]
Need to keep moving!

Id: [0x02627035]
If I stop, I die.

Id: [0x02627036]
I have to move.

Id: [0x02627038]
I must get out or I’m as good as dead.

Id: [0x02627039]
[FR][Il est là ! Attrapez le !](Over there! Get him!)

Id: [0x0262703A]
Help! Somebody help!

Id: [0x0262703B]
[FR][Il ne nous échappera pas cette fois !](He's not getting away from us this time!)

Id: [0x0262703E]
Give up, Shay!

Id: [0x0262703F]
How could you do this to us? How could you kill Hope!

Id: [0x02627040]
Your luck has run out!

Id: [0x02627041]
You won’t get out of here, you bastard!

Id: [0x02627042]
A cold grave awaits you!

Id: [0x02627044]
What do we have here? A map...

Id: [0x02627046]
I didn't think I'd find another map in these parts.

Id: [0x02627048]
A map!

Id: [0x02627049]
Another map!

Id: [0x0262704A]
A map... How many of those are there, I wonder.

Id: [0x0262704B]
How fortunate... Another one!

Id: [0x0262704C]
One more map!

Id: [0x0262704E]
That's it! The last map!

Id: [0x02627050]
An old relic... with the Templar symbol.

Id: [0x02627052]
Ah! Another Templar relic.

Id: [0x02627053]
A Templar relic!

Id: [0x02627054]
Another one! How many more relics are there?

Id: [0x02627055]
One more Templar relic.

Id: [0x02627056]
Another grave, another relic.

Id: [0x02627058]
The last relic! I have them all now.

Id: [0x02627061]
Another one... So they were here too.

Id: [0x02627062]
Another vestige!

Id: [0x02627063]
One more vestige.

Id: [0x02627064]
How many more of these will I find?

Id: [0x02627065]
Another one!

Id: [0x02627066]
One more for my collection.

Id: [0x02627067]
This is the last of them.

Id: [0x02627068]
A vestige from an ancient civilization...

Id: [0x0262706A]
A sword covered in runes... From the ancient Vikings!

Id: [0x0262706C]
Another sword. How far did the Vikings explore?

Id: [0x0262706E]
A Viking Sword!

Id: [0x0262706F]
Another one!

Id: [0x02627070]
One more Viking sword!

Id: [0x02627071]
Ah! Found another one!

Id: [0x02627072]
Yet another Viking sword.

Id: [0x02627074]
I have all I need now!

Id: [0x02627076]
Mmm... I should've expected to find a Templar cross here...

Id: [0x02627078]
A Templar cross...

Id: [0x02627079]
Here's another one!

Id: [0x0262707A]
One more Templar cross.

Id: [0x0262707B]
Another cross for my collection.

Id: [0x0262707C]
What's this... a Templar cross.

Id: [0x0262707E]
That's the last Templar cross.

Id: [0x02627080]
What do we have here... A Templar cross!

Id: [0x02627082]
These are scattered indeed...

Id: [0x02627084]
An ancient painting... What secrets it holds, I wonder...

Id: [0x02627086]
A cave painting!

Id: [0x02627087]
One more painting!

Id: [0x02627088]
Another piece of the story!

Id: [0x02627089]
Ah! Soon, I'll have the full story.

Id: [0x0262708A]
Another painting!

Id: [0x0262708C]
That's the last one.

Id: [0x0262708F]
This must be it! The Precursor site...

Id: [0x02627092]
What do we have here?

Id: [0x02627093]
Now... Where is that Piece of Eden?

Id: [0x02627094]
The artifact!

Id: [0x02627095]
The Apple of Eden!

Id: [0x0262709B]
I take my leave. Thank you again, Master Franklin.

Id: [0x0262709C]
I just watch over these laborers, trying to keep them safe. I am as fair as I can in deciding whom I hire and when they work. I have no idea why these men wish me harm. Do they think I am a wealthy man? Ha ha...[nervous laugh]

Id: [0x0262709D]
These fellows are everywhere, trying to control our lives through violence. My last article exposed them for what they are, my next one will bring them down once and for all!

Id: [0x0262709E]
Back in my day, men fought properly, face to face. If these clowns would only stand their ground, none of them could stop me! But, erhm... I can't climb roofs like I used to... Help me out, will you?

Id: [0x0262709F]
Good sir, you look like you're having a bad day too. My back aches something terrible. I was attacked by a bear and haven't been able to work in months! My stomach is rumbling almost as loudly as that bear did. Now some of my customers are complaining... Uh oh!

Id: [0x026270A0]
Those bastards! They sent me dozens of threats saying that the last woman who stood in their way was burned alive, like a witch. They are simply brutes. I have the local governance behind me. I am sure it is just a matter of time before we can rid our town of their filthy corruption!

Id: [0x026270A1]
You! It has been a long time since I have seen any living soul around here. Strange, you almost remind me of my former compatriots. I must be imagining things. They might be coming around soon, and I cannot be responsible for your safety if you hang about.

Id: [0x026270A2]
Come to join the hunt, my friend? We're not hunting elk today, I'll tell you that much. I'll try to leave some for you!

Id: [0x026270A3]
We cannot talk here. It's too risky. Know this: today seems calm, but I know for sure that the French are on the move.

Id: [0x026270A4]
Is this not beautiful? This view on the infinite ocean... No need to present yourself, I know who you are. Unfortunately, I will not be sharing the same fate as you...

Id: [0x026270A5]
These are difficult times, death is floating around like a fog. I don't have enough supplies to help everyone. The trade routes are too dangerous, few want to travel them. Let's hope to God we can settle down once and for all someday.

Id: [0x026270A6]
Everyone in this damned town is trying to steal my fishing spot. None of them will stop me today! You! You don't like fishing, do you?

Id: [0x026270A7]
I knew you’d take the bait, “hero”! Get him, brothers!

Id: [0x026270AD]
!*Poor sods.

Id: [0x026270AE]
!*Liam! Are you there?

Id: [0x026270BD]
Come.

Id: [0x026270C4]
!*Captain on deck!

Id: [0x026270E5]
You look tired, Shay.

Id: [0x026270E6]
Tired? Did you not see me dodging redcoats and gunfire and great bloody mortars?

Id: [0x026270E7]
You’re not a true Assassin until you get shot at on a regular basis.

Id: [0x026270E8]
Thank you, O Wise One!

Id: [0x026270EA]
This should be enough to improve the Morrigan, nice and proper.

Id: [0x026270EC]
If you’re planning to attack the fort without stronger cannons, then I admire your courage, sir. But, er, I do question your sanity!

Id: [0x026270F6]
I saw Achilles singing to little Connor the other day. It did my head in.

Id: [0x026270F7]
Why?

Id: [0x026270F8]
It’s like he’s two different people. With his wife and son, he’s all song and laughter, but with us, he’s a cranky old schoolmarm, all rules and books and beatings.

Id: [0x026270F9]
His family grounds him. They’re the best examples of the people we strive to protect. They make him a strong Mentor.

Id: [0x026270FA]
Well, maybe I’d like to share a laugh with the Mentor, too.

Id: [0x026270FB]
Don’t mistake hard lessons for hard feelings, Shay. We're all the sons of Achilles, in our own way.

Id: [0x026270FD]
Do you know how Achilles met Miss Abigail?

Id: [0x026270FE]
Achilles and another Assassin named John de la Tour were in Quebec, searching for traces of Those Who Came Before.

Id: [0x026270FF]
But she isn't an Assassin, like us.

Id: [0x02627100]
No. Achilles himself saved her from slavery. She’s no Assassin, but she’s a partner in the truest sense.

Id: [0x02627101]
And she really loves him, does she?

Id: [0x02627102]
Why not? He’s a strong and patient leader who wants nothing more than to see us all flourish.

Id: [0x02627103]
Why, Liam O’Brien, you sound half in love with him yourself!

Id: [0x02627104]
Can’t we have serious conversation for once?

Id: [0x02627106]
It’s so grim about the Homestead now that Miss Abigail and little Connor have passed.

Id: [0x02627107]
Aye. I’ve seen Achilles crying.

Id: [0x02627108]
Why shouldn’t he?

Id: [0x02627109]
It’s just that... he doesn’t look sad. He looks furious. It’s unsettling.

Id: [0x0262710A]
He's struggling with the loss. We all are.

Id: [0x0262710B]
I know. But, it’s been months... and we’ve done little but search for this blasted Manuscript and Box!

Id: [0x0262710C]
Le Chasseur has a lead on the Box. We’re to meet him and Chevalier in Saint John’s.

Id: [0x0262710D]
Chevalier, too? No hope of cheering me up, then.

Id: [0x0262711C]
I don’t care that he’s Mentor, or that his family is dead. There’s no excuse for this level of madness!

Id: [0x0262711D]
I must get that Manuscript...

Id: [0x0262711E]
I have already given Liam your next assignment. He waits for you at the docks.

Id: [0x02627122]
What have I done?

Id: [0x02627123]
This is my fault! My fault!

Id: [0x02627124]
I should never have come here!

Id: [0x02627125]
Where’s the water? Where’s my ship?

Id: [0x02627126]
Achilles! What have you made me do!?

Id: [0x02627127]
What was that blasted thing?

Id: [0x02627128]
Is there no end?

Id: [0x02627129]
I must get to the docks!

Id: [0x0262712A]
So many deaths!

Id: [0x0262712B]
I'm responsible for this!

Id: [0x0262712C]
Find cover!

Id: [0x0262712D]
Save yourselves!

Id: [0x0262712E]
Run! Run!

Id: [0x0262712F]
I’m sorry! I did this to you! I’m sorry!

Id: [0x02627131]
It’s warm in the Temple near them glowing beams of light, but I dare not get too close!

Id: [0x02627132]
I heard Achilles say that this place had defenses similar to something called “The Observatory”.

Id: [0x02627133]
I wonder if I can start a fire with those strange shafts of light in the Temple?

Id: [0x02627134]
What kind of intellect created a place like this? It's design makes no sense as far as I can see.

Id: [0x02627135]
Achilles says the Temple has traps for intruders.

Id: [0x02627136]
I’m not wise enough to deal with the kind of lunacy found in that temple!

Id: [0x02627137]
Why do I never get to visit the Temples full of death traps found in the Caribbean?

Id: [0x02627138]
Freeze to death outside, burn to death inside, it’s a grand old life, full of adventure, isn’t it?

Id: [0x02627139]
Okay, what are the rules for inside the Temple? Don’t touch the beams of light. Don’t fall off of the walkways. Actually, maybe I’ll just wait out here.

Id: [0x0262713B]
So what happens now?

Id: [0x0262713C]
As always, we continue our work.

Id: [0x0262713D]
Master Gist will be in charge of eradicating any remaining traces of the Assassins. Master Weeks and the others will assist him, of course.

Id: [0x0262713E]
Achilles has lost everything. He won’t dare leave his homestead.

Id: [0x0262713F]
He won’t...

Id: [0x02627140]
I see.

Id: [0x02627141]
Shay, although our search for Precursor sites is at an end, I want that Box. You will find it for the Templar Order, and for me.

Id: [0x02627142]
It could be anywhere in the world by now... It may take years to find it.

Id: [0x02627143]
It may take your lifetime. Are you up for the challenge?

Id: [0x02627144]
Yes... I will recover that Box, if it’s the last thing I do.

Id: [0x02627145]
Good.

Id: [0x02627146]
I... was right...[laughing] about you... all... along.

Id: [0x02627147]
[FR]Fils... de pute.(Son of a whore.)[laughing] I was right... about you... all along.

Id: [0x02627148]
For fuck's sake!

Id: [0x02627149]
His family is barely cold in the ground! The Templars are everywhere! Why do you insist on pushing your luck?

Id: [0x0262714A]
I make my--

Id: [0x0262714B]
Don’t! Not another fucking word!

Id: [0x0262714C]
Don’t! Not another word!

Id: [0x0262714D]
Since we were boys, you’ve been running your mouth ahead of your common sense!

Id: [0x0262714E]
You’re a fine one to talk about common sense, following the orders of a bitter madman like Achilles!

Id: [0x02627150]
Enough! I’m done cleaning up your mess, understand? You give your head a shake. I’ll calm Achilles down.

Id: [0x02627151]
I don’t need--

Id: [0x02627152]
You will sit! And! Wait! And when the time comes, you’ll show Achilles some respect if it’s the last thing you do!

Id: [0x02627155]
A fine friend you turned out to be.

Id: [0x02627156]
For fuck's sake!

Id: [0x02627157]
His family is barely cold in the ground! The Templars are everywhere! Why do you insist on pushing your luck?

Id: [0x02627158]

Don’t! Not another fucking word!

Id: [0x0262715A]
Don’t! Not another word!

I don’t need--

Id: [0x0262715F]
You will sit! And! Wait! And when the time comes, you’ll show Achilles some respect if it’s the last thing you do!

Id: [0x02627162]
A fine friend you turned out to be.

Id: [0x02627163]
Unhand me!

Id: [0x02627164]
[grunt of effort]

Id: [0x0262716E]
Did you see their faces when we stole those apples?

Id: [0x0262716F]
(Laughs)

Id: [0x02627170]
(Laughs)

Id: [0x02627171]
I'm Arno.

Id: [0x02627172]
Élise.

Id: [0x02627173]
I'm here with my father.

Id: [0x02627174]
So am I. He has important business with the king.

Id: [0x02627175]
What should we do now?

Id: [0x02627176]
Ssshh. Listen.

Id: [0x02627177]
Don't worry. They'll never think to look for us in here.

Id: [0x02627178]
It was my fault. I'm the one who took the apple.

Id: [0x02627179]
Let's see where they're going!

Id: [0x0262717D]
While you were busy taking down that fort, I happened to stumble upon the treasury.

Id: [0x0262717E]
You don't say...

Id: [0x0262717F]
It was the damndest thing...[clearing his throat] Well, in any case, amongst other things I found maps and charts detailing various French trade routes.

Id: [0x02627180]
What are you thinking, Gist?

Id: [0x02627181]
I thought perhaps we could use them to, er, help the Royal Navy... and fill our pockets.[beat]  I stored these maps in your cabin, Captain. Should you want to use them.

Id: [0x000D1792]
You must choose, Quick!

Id: [0x000D197F]
How did you get past the guard? No one gets past the guard.

Id: [0x000D19A9]
All right. We need to go. Do you have any idea where I can take you?

Id: [0x000D19DE]
Are you Anthousa?

Id: [0x000D19E3]
If the hetaerae aren't here, where are they?

Id: [0x000D19E4]
You want 'em, you'll find 'em up on the hill - the Akrokorinth. By the Temple, keeping Aphrodite's worshippers satisfied.

Id: [0x000D19EE]
The hetaerae! Where are they?!

Id: [0x000D19EF]
We're here in <i>peace</i>!

Id: [0x000D19F0]
[&gasp]Aphrodite aid us!

Id: [0x000D19F1]
Then <i>you're </i>gonna pay for the trouble we went through to find 'em.

Id: [0x000D19F4]
<i>Ai-ya! </i>They think this temple is dedicated to <i>them, </i>the brutes.

Id: [0x000D19F5]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]The thieves are here and the hetaerae aren't.

Id: [0x000D19F6]
The hetaerae? [&ah]They're much wiser than we are. They realized their visitors were all getting robbed on the way in.

Id: [0x000D19F9]
There's no avoiding the Monger's men in Korinth.

Id: [0x000D19FE]
Master of the underground markets. He rules with one hand open for money, and the other clenched around a weapon.

Id: [0x000D1A01]
Good. Maybe pray to Aphrodite from home next time.

Id: [0x000D1A04]
[&scoff]Who walks around with a name like the "Monger"?

Id: [0x000D1A05]
A drachmae- and blood-hungry monster's what he is!

Id: [0x000D1A06]
If you know of the hetaerae, then you know of Anthousa. I'm looking for her.

Id: [0x000D1A07]
They say she's everywhere, though I've never seen her. [beat]But the hetaerae see <i>everything!</i>

Id: [0x000D1A18]
I propose a trade. Help me - help <i>us</i> - get stronger. Strong enough to rid Korinth of the Monger permanently. A simple transaction, I assure you.

Id: [0x000D1A7B]
Then we're in business.

Id: [0x000D1A7C]
Then you've held your ground well. You're not dead.

Id: [0x000D1A7D]
Not yet, anyway. But he's employed enough thugs to amass a small army. Now they're attacking people in the street - us included.

Id: [0x000D1A82]
Remind me. Where do I find the Monger's warehouse?

Id: [0x000D1A83]
It's at the Port of Lechaion. Burn it to the ground.

Id: [0x000D1A8F]
Then the warehouse will be cinders.

Id: [0x000D1ABF]
Not everyone can be spared of Hades. My thanks anyways.

Id: [0x000D1AC3]
My name's Kassandra. I'd thank you too if I knew who you were.

Id: [0x000D1AC4]
Brasidas of Sparta. You're a newcomer to Korinth.

Id: [0x000D1AC5]
I get the sense that's a Korinthian hobby. Anthousa has her hetaerae watching from every post.

Id: [0x000D1AC6]
Ah, Anthousa. We disagree, but have a common enemy.

Id: [0x000D1AC7]
So, Sparta also has a Monger problem. What do you know about him?

Id: [0x000D1AC8]
His weapon has a far reach. Korinth is allied with Sparta. It's our duty to protect them.

Id: [0x000D1B01]
Greetings, young one. Come to offer Asklepios a sacrifice?

Id: [0x000D1B02]
No, but I'm searching for a Spartan mother who may have.

Id: [0x000D1B1A]
If you're here for your purification bath, you'll have to come back another time.

Id: [0x000D1B20]
And? Is the bathhouse free of snakes?

Id: [0x000D1CBC]
Killing seems to run in your bloodline, oh mighty Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000D1CC0]
What did you do with my brother?

Id: [0x000D1D55]
You call me snake, yet you took two lives tonight. The infant's, and now mine. I'm proud of you, my child.

Id: [0x000D1F92]
We have that in common.

Id: [0x000D1FCA]
Where did my mother go that night?

Id: [0x000D216E]
I haven't met any hetaerae yet.

Id: [0x000D216F]
Don't believe all you hear. They sell what a lot of us sell in Korinth - but for them, it's not just about the flesh. They're merchants of a sort. Streetwise - can talk as nice as they look.

Id: [0x000D2277]
First time talking ! I have a MIGHTY QUEST for you !

Id: [0x000D2284]
Setting local variable to true.

Id: [0x000D22EB]
You! Please! Help!

Id: [0x000D2353]
You fight like a Spartan! There's resolve in you.

Id: [0x000D2366]
The ones in the warehouse? I freed them already.

Id: [0x000D2367]
A good soldier acts when he's told. A great one is two steps ahead. Thank you.

Id: [0x000D236D]
Chrysis lit the temple on fire with the boy and me inside.

Id: [0x000D2379]
I am not your child. I will find my mother, and we will be together again. I <i>will</i> make this right.

Id: [0x000D237C]
I will not stop until every last Cultist has met my spear. You will be erased from history. <i>I</i> will erase you.

Id: [0x000D23FB]
Nice view.

Id: [0x000D23FE]
If you're here for more than the view, I have a task for you. It is <i>crucial</i> this package gets to its proper recipient. [beat]It's not from me, but a man named Diodoros.

Id: [0x000D2403]
I'll help, but it's only that little box?

Id: [0x000D2404]
You'll have to find another delivery girl.

Id: [0x000D2409]
One should never judge something by its size, you know. A small thing may very well make a <i>huge</i> impact.

Id: [0x000D27F7]
Good choice.

Id: [0x000D27F9]
Too slow...

Id: [0x000D2B3B]
You already completed the quest before talking to me.

Id: [0x000D2B3C]
Easy Peazy Lemon Sqeezy.

Id: [0x000D2B42]
Well said !

Id: [0x000D2B48]
I was able to pick this choice because the local variable was set to true.

Id: [0x000D2E50]
Business is booming. You're doing great work, son.

Id: [0x000D2E51]
Thanks, father.

Id: [0x000D2E53]
Curses!

Id: [0x000D2E71]
If you insist. We'll meet you at the Sacred Cave.

Id: [0x000D2E7B]
I know I'm not the boy's real mother, but he seems to have accepted me.

Id: [0x000D2E7E]
It's okay to make mistakes, son. There are worse things in life.

Id: [0x000D2F31]
Wait! No!

Id: [0x000D2F32]
Anthousa...

Id: [0x000D2F33]
Take him out of here and bring him to the theater! Show everyone his cowardice.

Id: [0x000D2F38]
To the theater!

Id: [0x000D34F0]
Wait... what?

Id: [0x000D3689]
You wanted him dead. Here he is.

Id: [0x000D368A]
It's a shame the people don't get to see him bleed.

Id: [0x000D368C]
His cries should've rung out across the city!

Id: [0x000D368F]
Wish I coulda been there to watch Deimos break your neck.

Id: [0x000D3690]
Don't make me laugh.

Id: [0x000D4844]
<i>Chaire,</i> Kassandra! The mighty mercenary and traveler has finally made her grand entrance. Only slightly late, too.

Id: [0x000D4845]
Do you really think these people will help me?

Id: [0x000D4846]
They may not look it, but this group holds the way to the future on the tip of their opinionated tongues.

Id: [0x000D4848]
Ah, Sophokles and Euripides, for example. Two of the most celebrated playwrights to date. No one can throw stones as far as they can. They appear to be locked in some kind of intellectual struggle, as is their way.

Id: [0x000D4849]
Hermippos has also written his fair share of comedies...

Id: [0x000D484A]
I’m not sure “great” is the term I would use...

Id: [0x000D4B41]
People of Korinth! Behold the weasel that steals your bread! The scourge that spoils your crops!

Id: [0x000D4B46]
You've waited long enough to get your hands on him.

Id: [0x000D4B48]
I have been <i>starving </i>for this.

Id: [0x000D4B4A]
And <i>you </i>deserve your answers. Come, let's speak. In private.

Id: [0x000D4F13]
Hey you ! Come with me on this wonderful journey to a specific point in this QCGYM.

Id: [0x000D4F14]
I won't follow you unless you have candies.

Id: [0x000D4F15]
I have cake ! I promise you, this is going to be the best cake you've ever had.

Id: [0x000D4F16]
You're not fooling anyone with cake, everybody has played Portal at this point.

Id: [0x000D4F17]
I promise you this is no lie ! We're almost there, just a few more meters...

Id: [0x000D4F18]
Alright, but only because we've been walking for so long already...

Id: [0x000D4F19]
Here we are ! Thanks for following me !

Id: [0x000D4F1A]
So... I was promised a reward... Where is my reward?!

Id: [0x000D4FE5]
It's time. Soak in your victory, then meet me somewhere quiet. I'll tell you all I know about your mother.

Id: [0x000D4FF1]
I can't give enough thanks for what you've done. [&laughs]And for once I can also thank Alkibiades - he sent you here, after all.

Id: [0x000D4FF2]
It's no secret that I'll also benefit from his death.

Id: [0x000D50CE]
Siren Song.

Id: [0x000D50CF]
It was famous for weathering all that Poseidon threw in its path.

Id: [0x000D50D0]
Thank you, Anthousa.

Id: [0x000D50D1]
Was there no mention of her past? A husband, family...

Id: [0x000D535B]
Yes?

Id: [0x000D535F]
That's one way to do it.

Id: [0x000D5360]
We're still pirates. We've a reputation to uphold in these waters, and nothing says, "respect me" like a bit of blood spilling.

Id: [0x000D5361]
Sounds to me like you're weakening the competition. Keos not big enough for your ambitions?

Id: [0x000D5362]
If we were going to take more territory we wouldn't be hiring the likes of you. We'd do it ourselves. Best way to prevent an attack is to strike first.

Id: [0x000D5373]
I'll sink the ships for you. What am I targeting?

Id: [0x000D5374]
Just make sure you're flying Xenia's colors when you do the sinking. I'll pay you well to ensure the message is understood.

Id: [0x000D539A]
Oh... [beat]I'll be back once I've destroyed all the ships.

Id: [0x000D539B]
No need to keep me updated. Just come back when you've done the job.

Id: [0x000D53B3]
I've sunk the ships.

Id: [0x000D53B4]
I knew I liked you. Xenia will be pleased that her waters are back under her control.

Id: [0x000D542A]
She said you'd have work for me.

Id: [0x000D5499]
Gotarzes back yet?

Id: [0x000D549A]
No, and I think the next person who says "Gotarzes" or "iron shipment" to Xenia will have their guts for a hat.

Id: [0x000D54E1]
Tell that to Xenia, why don't you?

Id: [0x000D54E2]
Iron's worth a fortune. I'd go after it myself if I were sure Gotarzes was dead.

Id: [0x000D55BB]
What do you need?

Id: [0x000D55BC]
Ships are pushing into our territory and testing us. Xenia wants to send a message to make sure people understand who owns this little part of the Aegean.

Id: [0x000D5632]
Flattery is fine, but I’m here for the bounty.

Id: [0x000D5633]
Of course.

Id: [0x000D593F]
What has this man done?

Id: [0x000D5945]
Now, I know the situation doesn't look good...

Id: [0x000D5946]
You can't blame me for the rocks.

Id: [0x000D594F]
Gotarzes!

Id: [0x000D595B]
He sailed too close to the shore. The ship got caught on the rocks.

Id: [0x000D6FE1]
The ship is gone, but he's alive.

Id: [0x000D727F]
I saw innocents trapped in the flames.

Id: [0x000D74A8]
[&ahem]Yes. You're right. He's dead.

Id: [0x000D7528]
Kleon said you're wasting the people's drachmae. If he had his way, he'd serve them your head.

Id: [0x000D7A30]
So Gotarzes still isn't back. Looking more and more likely there's iron to salvage.

Id: [0x000D7A31]
Gotarzes will come crawling back. He always does. Hasn't even got the balls to face Charon, that one.

Id: [0x000D7A41]
I have something important to say

Id: [0x000D7A42]
Really? This is very interesting...

Id: [0x000D7A5C]
I'm not sure I'm interested in helping.

Id: [0x000D7A5D]
I'll be here if you change your mind.

Id: [0x000D7AA0]
<i>Me?</i> Anthousa?

Id: [0x000D7B65]
You know me?

Id: [0x000D7BB8]
We saw you help the worshippers at the temple of Aphrodite. You've proven yourself a friend.

Id: [0x000D7C05]
They will if you get them to trust you. And you've wisely dressed for the occasion. <i>Appearing</i> trustworthy is the most important part of being trusted, after all. Now then, come let me introduce you to everyone.

Id: [0x000D7C07]
Perhaps your... individual fashion sense will get their memories working. Now then, let me introduce you to everyone.

Id: [0x000D7C0B]
It looks more like a lover's quarrel to me.

Id: [0x000D7C17]
Thank you, Herodotos.

Id: [0x000D7C18]
Now, if you'll excuse me. Perikles is here somewhere, and I need to prepare him... If he's alone, I'll tell him what your brother said.

Id: [0x000D7C1E]
Don't let the company here tonight intimidate you.

Id: [0x000D7C4F]
Herodotos! Athenians have no problem letting me know when I'm not welcome. It's a relief to see your friendly face.

Id: [0x000D7C5E]
Come and get it.

Id: [0x000D7C79]
Oh, don’t let Sokrates get under your skin. At least he wore shoes for the occasion... And the poor thing gesticulating like an ape is Thrasymachos. If you listen closely, you’ll notice he and Sokrates are actually arguing the same points. But the wind from his wild gestures deafens him to critique.

Id: [0x000D7C7B]
Where is Perikles?

Id: [0x000D7C7C]
Oh! He never attends his own parties. Which reminds me, there’s something I need to get his help with...

Id: [0x000D7C7E]
Vile Sokrates! Always appearing where I least expect him. Warrior, protect me from his amorous gaze! …Oh, Alkibiades. This is not a time for jealousy, but for love!

Id: [0x000D7C80]
Let's not use Alkibiades as an example. Be good, and don’t drink too much.

Id: [0x000D7C89]
I've heard of Sophokles. In my line of work, it pays to know who the richest and most famous men are.

Id: [0x000D7C8C]
Inviting Sokrates seems like a good way to ruin everyone's night. I'm surprised they would let him in the door.

Id: [0x000D7C90]
This party could be fun. Alkibiades drinks like a Spartan. Maybe he fights like one, too.

Id: [0x000D7C91]
This is going to be a long night. Parties should be about vomiting up blood, not vomiting up poetry. These people are so... clean.

Id: [0x000D7CBD]
He's a writer of comedies, of all things! Comedies, Euripides!

Id: [0x000D7CC4]
You should drink more.

Id: [0x000D7D8C]
Oh, didn’t see you there. I am normally much more able to notice approaching adventurers like you. If you could come beside me, I would rather not be yelling at you.

Id: [0x000D7D8D]
I thank you.

Id: [0x000D7D8E]
I previously sent two soldiers underneath the temple to fetch something for me. They might eventually come back, but I must retrieve this something immediately, so I would rather do less and send another fighter again.

Id: [0x000D7D8F]
This is tough, but I don’t want to end up sending the entire village.

Id: [0x000D7D90]
I’m really going above and beyond here, do me this favor once. First, go talk to Sokrates inside his house, he will know what to do.

Id: [0x000D7D91]
If anyone asks, I was never here, this will be our secret, yes?

Id: [0x000D7DA2]
That isn't at all what I mean!

Id: [0x000D7DD0]
So, we get him drunk, and he talks? He sounds more Argive than Athenian.

Id: [0x000D7DE0]
You can stop hiding in here. Euripides won't notice you coming out - he won't notice <i>anything</i>.

Id: [0x000D7DE3]
I believe you mean to ask me, "How does Perikles know you?" I'm the greatest dramatist in the land, mentor to Euripides, lover of Asklepios, father of theater, and so on, and so on.

Id: [0x000D7E0D]
It's come back for more! Care to see my impression of Protagoras? I call it "The Flapping Bladder."

Id: [0x000D80D7]
He's dead. I've delivered. Your turn.

Id: [0x000D81A6]
Feel better?

Id: [0x000D837E]
Look, you insignificant peon. Tell me where he is or by Hera, I'll burn this clinic to the ground with you in it!

Id: [0x000D83B3]
I'm sure there's no need for raised voices.

Id: [0x000D83E1]
I thought this party was tame, even by Athenian standards... until now.

Id: [0x000D83EF]
I might be back.

Id: [0x000D83F2]
I come bearing gifts.

Id: [0x000D83F5]
You've grown up in Perikles's home, and yet you're so... different.

Id: [0x000D8481]
Back away from the boy. Slowly.

Id: [0x000D8482]
Oh, thank all the gods she's gone. I thought she was going to kill me this time.

Id: [0x000D8483]
I need to meet Hippokrates. Is he in Argolis at least?

Id: [0x000D8485]
If you're going to meet Hippokrates... could I trouble you with a small errand?

Id: [0x000D8486]
My services don't come free.

Id: [0x000D8487]
I'll be sure he gets the equipment.

Id: [0x000D848E]
Is this his workshop?

Id: [0x000D8499]
You have been arguing a single point all night, and no one has a black eye? You have my attention.

Id: [0x000D849D]
Is that?

Id: [0x000D849F]
I have seen enough of the world to know that there are no "just" rulers. Even Perikles is self-serving.

Id: [0x000D84EA]
I'll get to it. Look for the flames.

Id: [0x000D855D]
Anthousa has given me her word, and I've given her mine. She's hired me to kill the Monger.

Id: [0x000D8562]
Keep your spear pointed his way, and Sparta will thank you.

Id: [0x000D8563]
Oh, didn’t see you there. I am normally much more able to notice approaching adventurers like you. If you could come beside me, I would rather not be yelling at you.

Id: [0x000D8564]
I thank you.

Id: [0x000D8565]
I previously sent two soldiers underneath the temple to fetch something for me. They might eventually come back, but I must retrieve this something immediately, so I would rather do less and send another fighter again.

Id: [0x000D8566]
This is tough, but I don’t want to end up sending the entire village.

Id: [0x000D8567]
I’m really going above and beyond here, do me this favor once. First, go talk to Sokrates inside his house, he will know what to do.

Id: [0x000D8568]
If anyone asks, I was never here, this will be our secret, yes?

Id: [0x000D8569]
What do you want again ?

Id: [0x000D86B4]
She did?

Id: [0x000D86B5]
She has something I need, and the Monger's in my way.

Id: [0x000D8780]
The great goddess Hera guides many mothers to this sacred place. Surely I'm too feeble to remember them all.

Id: [0x000D881E]
I already told you what I know!

Id: [0x000D8822]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000D8823]
I'm looking for a man named Hippokrates.

Id: [0x000D8824]
Who dares threaten the Priestess of Hera?

Id: [0x000D8827]
What's going on?

Id: [0x000D8828]
I'm Sostratos. Chrysis has accused my master Hippokrates of impiety.

Id: [0x000D8829]
Yes, but he's gone southeast of Hera's Watch to help the sick and injured.

Id: [0x000D882B]
The priests try their best, but their methods are stuck in the past. Hippokrates is researching new cures and treatments.

Id: [0x000D8831]
Depends what it is.

Id: [0x000D8832]
I want you to bring him some equipment. He was in such a hurry, he left it behind.

Id: [0x000D8836]
It's Hippokrates's clinic. Here we study healing, offer treatments, and provide care to anyone who asks.

Id: [0x000D8837]
Why not work with the priests in the Sanctuary of Asklepios? It's what this region is known for, right?

Id: [0x000D88A0]
He gave his life willingly, just as any of my followers would. It's an honor to die at the hands of  Hera's high priestess, Messenger. Join me. Join us, and we will bring unjust, murderous kings and leaders to their knees. Bring order to Greece! Let them feel the honor of bleeding on our blades! We can unite the entire polis, you and I. Think of it. No war. No suffering.

Id: [0x000D88A1]
He gave his life willingly, just as any of my followers would. It's an honor to die at the hands of the gods, Messenger. Join me. Join us, and we will bring unjust kings and leaders to their knees. Let them feel that honor! We can unite Greece. No war. No suffering.

Id: [0x000D88A2]
He gave his life willingly, just as any of my followers would. It's an honor to die at the end of my blade, Messenger. Join me. Join us, and we will bring unjust kings and leaders to their knees. Let them feel that honor! We can unite Greece. No war. No suffering.

Id: [0x000D88B9]
Gladly. If you like, we can feed them to the goat.

Id: [0x000D89D2]
Lately his attitudes have garnered him more notice than his works. However, the fellow beside him, Protagoras, is a sophist worthy of as much praise as the great Sokrates himself.

Id: [0x000D8BA9]
So, tell me, what does a <i>misthios</i> like you think of a party like this?

Id: [0x000D8BB6]
If I could suggest anything - please don't start a fight. Or end one.

Id: [0x000D8BBB]
I won't.

Id: [0x000D8BBC]
Perikles is no king. He needs these guests to love him, so that the people love him. And they, in turn, need Perikles. You're no different from any of them.

Id: [0x000D8C8C]
If these guests aren't to your own... unique tastes, then just focus on why you came here in the first place.

Id: [0x000D8EC5]
Someone like me is always on the move. I've docked my ship in <i>every</i> "port"!

Id: [0x000D901B]
- is a quick slice of the blade.

Id: [0x000D9033]
I could be <i>any</i>one for you, lamb. I charge less than the hetaerae, but do I ever know my way around a hay-bed!

Id: [0x000D9046]
Their sort are too high-and-mighty to be down here in the dirt with us.

Id: [0x000D9294]
Yet another crazed follower of the madman himself!

Id: [0x000D9296]
Tell your impious master that unless he makes a public apology and soon, this Priestess of Hera will gather an army of faithful and shut him down.

Id: [0x000D9298]
Out of my way.

Id: [0x000D929D]
Is he impious?

Id: [0x000D929E]
I'm sorry. He isn't here.

Id: [0x000D92E1]
Impressive, foreigner. Euripides <i>is</i> from Argos.

Id: [0x000D92FE]
How do you know Perikles?

Id: [0x000D930B]
It wouldn't be a party without someone losing their stomach. I'll let you know if your plan worked.

Id: [0x000D930D]
Hiding?! Heed this: <i>war</i> has come to Athens. First they take our homes, then they take our heads. I intend to be found with at least my dignity intact. Or what's left of it, anyway.

Id: [0x000D956F]
All right. If nothing else, this party could use the help.

Id: [0x000D9570]
You'll need to pick the right wine for this task. The kitchen should have what you need. Let me know when Euripides is done in, and I'll slip away unseen.

Id: [0x000D96FD]
He is <i>dead!</i>

Id: [0x000D970E]
Everybody benefits, everybody wins.

Id: [0x000D9710]
You've proven to be a very valuable business partner.

Id: [0x000D9711]
Speaking of business. You owe me, Anthousa.

Id: [0x000D9718]
May the gods look well upon you, Kassandra. Visit me any time - I'll catch you up on Korinth's affairs. It seems I have an interesting future ahead of me.

Id: [0x000D978F]
[&grunt]Fine. Lead the way.

Id: [0x000D9793]
No.

Id: [0x000D9794]
Deimos would be disappointed in you.

Id: [0x000D97D1]
I'll keep my guard up.

Id: [0x000D97D5]
Don't let him hear you say that!

Id: [0x000D97D8]
I've seen them gather by the Spring of Peirene, down the mountain. They meet clients there, and then take 'em elsewhere in secret.

Id: [0x000D9834]
Now it's time for you to help me, "Allie." I'm looking for someone.

Id: [0x000D9835]
All business, right until the end. I like that.

Id: [0x000D983A]
Fled Sparta? No one flees Sparta! But, let's pretend she did. If she were stupid, she'd be dead. If she were <i>smart</i>, she'd do what Aspasia did - she'd earn her independence.

Id: [0x000D9872]
The smartest and most... resourceful women I've ever met have been in Korinthia.

Id: [0x000D9895]
Let them have their meeting of the minds. I'm more interested in meeting... other <i>parts</i>.

Id: [0x000D98D9]
You have enough servants. Get them to do it.

Id: [0x000D98DA]
Shame. If you change your mind, I promise to pour the oil on you. <i>And</i> lick it off.

Id: [0x000D98DE]
After your... <i>display</i> earlier, it's probably safer I get the oil.

Id: [0x000D98E9]
Obedient too? I knew I liked you. Don't take too long.

Id: [0x000D9932]
Please be careful with that equipment. It's very important.

Id: [0x000D9963]
It's Hippokrates. It's really him!

Id: [0x000D9981]
I was just about to come find you. Clearly you were thinking the same thing I was.

Id: [0x000D99A9]
Just can't stay away, can you? Did you bring the oil?

Id: [0x000D9A40]
Anthousa in Korinth. It's not much, but it's a start.

Id: [0x000D9AB9]
I only came to this symposium to find someone.

Id: [0x000D9ABA]
Sounds like we can help each other then, doesn't it? You fetch us a bit of oil, I help you find who you're looking for. Maybe they're in here.

Id: [0x000D9B8A]
<i>No one </i>is like Perikles. And he's only slightly more serious than usual, too. Athens is under siege and he worries for her future...

Id: [0x000D9B8B]
If you come back with a jar of oil, I promise to show you how grateful I am.

Id: [0x000D9B8D]
We're saved! Today, these women grieved for their sons, and these men worked the wall. But tonight we forget all of that. Let's have some fun! What do you say? Care to join us?

Id: [0x000D9B8F]
Time for some fun. You'll have to help me strip off these uncomfortable Athenian robes.

Id: [0x000D9B90]
There's another goat?

Id: [0x000D9B99]
Allie! Come back inside!

Id: [0x000D9B9A]
The celebration continues!

Id: [0x000D9B9E]
A new face in Perikles's abode! That in itself is a remarkable thing. You must have seen me doing my impression of Kleon. I call it "The Orange Ape." Tell me, what does it think?

Id: [0x000D9B9F]
Hmm. I wouldn’t peg you as a Kassandra. But never mind. I’m Aristophanes, and this man is Euripides.

Id: [0x000D9BA1]
Oh, go on. Introduce yourself.

Id: [0x000D9BA2]
I’m Euripides.

Id: [0x000D9BA3]
Did you just call me "it"?! Watch your mouth, Athenian.

Id: [0x000D9BA6]
If you see Perikles, tell him I said thank you for another colorful evening.

Id: [0x000D9BA7]
For a playwright, you're not much for words.

Id: [0x000D9BA8]
<i>Good men lead quiet lives</i>, as old Euripides likes to say. Don't you, Euripides?

Id: [0x000D9BAA]
Now, if you'll excuse us, I was just about to dazzle this old dog with my impression of Perikles. I call it "The Wooden Board."

Id: [0x000D9BB0]
The man <i>is</i> your host.

Id: [0x000D9BB1]
<i>Under every stone hides a politician</i>, I always say, and Perikles is no different.

Id: [0x000D9BB3]
Why don't you just apologize to Sophokles?

Id: [0x000D9BB4]
It's he who should apologize to you!

Id: [0x000D9BB6]
Sophokles is a friend, and one good friend is worth an entire family. He just needs time to recover from his outburst.

Id: [0x000D9BBC]
Care for another impression? My favorite is Sophokles.

Id: [0x000D9BBF]
Well, if you'll excuse us, I'm working on my impression of you. I call it "The Pretty Monkey."

Id: [0x000D9BC2]
That one isn't funny.

Id: [0x000D9BC4]
When I need to relax, I start a fight. For you, though...

Id: [0x000D9BCC]
I'm Perikles's new servant. I'd be happy to bring some wine.

Id: [0x000D9BCD]
An Athenian servant? You? And these are wine-pouring muscles?

Id: [0x000D9BCE]
I was a rower on Perikles's ship, where he took pity on me. Now, I pour wine for people who question my word, and his.

Id: [0x000D9BCF]
I... I wasn't questioning. I... perhaps one drink.

Id: [0x000D9BD0]
You and Aristophanes could both use a drink. Let's play a game.

Id: [0x000D9BD1]
A competition?

Id: [0x000D9BD8]
I'll return. And when I do, you two will drink up.

Id: [0x000D9BDB]
I'm sure she wouldn't.

Id: [0x000D9BDC]
Perikles has invited all of you here for some reason.

Id: [0x000D9BE1]
After my argument with Sophokles, I think I'd rather keep my head clear.

Id: [0x000D9BE5]
Ah! Wonderful idea. Euripides seems quiet, but he never turns down a challenge.

Id: [0x000D9BE6]
Well, if you brought us some wine, I wouldn't be opposed to showing this young one how we Argives drink.

Id: [0x000D9BEB]
Either we dine here, and praise Perikles, or we dine with Kleon... But Kleon has all the charm of a typical politician - a horrible voice, bad breeding, and vulgar manners.

Id: [0x000D9BED]
I'm only here because I'm searching for someone.

Id: [0x000D9BEE]
And yet it gave us the distinct impression it was here to fill our wine. Let's focus on that first, shall we?

Id: [0x000D9BFD]
Let's conjure Dionysos, shall we?

Id: [0x000D9C00]
This... this is pure swill.

Id: [0x000D9C02]
Amateur! In my day, this would be considered nectar of the gods. Another round!

Id: [0x000D9C04]
Ready for more?

Id: [0x000D9C07]
Gah! I can hardly stomach this pig's piss.

Id: [0x000D9C08]
I could outdrink both of you with one hand! Let's have some more.

Id: [0x000D9C0A]
You ready for another?

Id: [0x000D9C0F]
You... I like you. Who brought you here?

Id: [0x000D9C11]
[&vomit]This wine is terrible.

Id: [0x000D9C43]
Quickly, bring him some wine so that he might say something clever!

Id: [0x000DA022]
Hello World!

Id: [0x000DA036]
Of course, I only use the terms war, or god, or civility, in the context of what can be observed. So, I can observe soldiers fighting, but does that bring me any closer to understanding war?

Id: [0x000DA059]
I'm looking for Anthousa. Is she here?

Id: [0x000DA05A]
Wouldn't <i>I</i> like to know. Sunrise, sunset, I save my drachmae for a taste of the divine. The hetaerae are hard to come by!

Id: [0x000DA05B]
So you haven't seen them.

Id: [0x000DA05C]
Not with the Monger's army on the loose. The hetaerae won't tolerate that.

Id: [0x000DA070]
Haven't done something wrong, have I? Swear I haven't!

Id: [0x000DA071]
If you have, you might see me later. [beat]I'm looking for Anthousa.

Id: [0x000DA073]
No one <i>really </i>knows Anthousa. And the hetaerae got pushed out of here ages ago!

Id: [0x000DA074]
Hm. Then I'll keep looking.

Id: [0x000DA075]
Someone around here's gotta know. 'Til then, I'll be on my best behavior, <i>misthios!</i>

Id: [0x000DA07F]
<i>Chaire</i>! We were just discussing Hermippos's failures in his indictment of Aspasia.

Id: [0x000DA080]
Well, <i>you</i> were. I was sleeping with my eyes open.

Id: [0x000DA091]
And so it isn't the rich and powerful, but the <i>gods</i> who are the source of justice?

Id: [0x000DA092]
What? No! Have you been listening to nothing I say?

Id: [0x000DA093]
Yes, <i>you</i> come and talk to this infuriating air bladder. I've had my fill.

Id: [0x000DA094]
Perhaps later. First, explain to me your point again.

Id: [0x000DA0B5]
You really intend to use this young distraction to avoid the point being argued?

Id: [0x000DA0B6]
If you've been arguing this long, and you haven't agreed yet, just give up.

Id: [0x000DA0B7]
We're discussing the nature of rulers. Where better to do so than here? I'll ask you the same question I asked Thrasymachos: would you agree that the act of ruling is an art?

Id: [0x000DA0B8]
It is an art, as all worthy undertakings are. That is not up for argument.

Id: [0x000DA0B9]
Yet, medicine is for the betterment of the patient, and not the physician. Carpentry improves the building, not the builder. Then - is the art of ruling not for the betterment of the ruled rather than the ruler?

Id: [0x000DA0BA]
Don't be absurd!

Id: [0x000DA0C5]
Is a Spartan general who brings order to his troops, thereby saving his own life, self-serving? I'm not sure that's the case.

Id: [0x000DA0C9]
Ruling a city and fighting in battle are different things.

Id: [0x000DA0CA]
By practicing the art of war, doesn't the general guarantee some of his troops a ferry ride to Hades, when a swift retreat would save all their lives?

Id: [0x000DA0DB]
This argument between you two is pointless.

Id: [0x000DA0DC]
Perhaps. How do you define art?

Id: [0x000DA0DD]
I'm not getting dragged into this.

Id: [0x000DA0DE]
Very well. Answer this: does the artist not give form and symmetry to her subject?

Id: [0x000DA0DF]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x000DA0E0]
Laws and justice do much the same for people, do they not? And is there any better way to communicate the story of a people than by revealing its customs and laws? If yes, then ruling, and thus justice, must be an art, as Thrasymachos says.

Id: [0x000DA0F0]
Aspasia.

Id: [0x000DA22C]
I've had enough Athenian hospitality to last me a lifetime.

Id: [0x000DA231]
I'm not done with these people yet.

Id: [0x000DA34B]
This is Random Scene 1, playing Random Scene 1

Id: [0x000DA34D]
This is Random Scene 2, playing Random Scene 2

Id: [0x000DA34F]
This is Random Scene Condition, playing Random Scene Condition because a dialogue variable was previously set to true.

Id: [0x000DA596]
We were in the middle of a raging battle!

Id: [0x000DA6A6]
Gotarzes promised a reward. A substantial one, if I remember it right.

Id: [0x000DA6A8]
Pay her, then.

Id: [0x000DA6A9]
Me? But you're the one who -

Id: [0x000DA6AC]
Family is family. No reward necessary.

Id: [0x000DA6AE]
No. I am in your debt.

Id: [0x000DAA54]
Focus. I'm looking for a woman who fled Sparta a long, long time ago.

Id: [0x000DB1FB]
What are these stone slabs for?

Id: [0x000DB1FE]
These are records. We document all who pass through - their illnesses, treatments - so that the glory of Asklepios can be celebrated.

Id: [0x000DB22B]
I'm looking for my mother, a Spartan woman who came through here. This kind priest brought me to this stone - it could be hers.

Id: [0x000DB22C]
I um, have to... There's something - I must be going.

Id: [0x000DB22D]
I'm filthy and could use a good bath. The kind priest here was pointing me in the direction of the bath house.

Id: [0x000DB22E]
It reads "Of Sparta. Came here with child. Sought pity from the gods."

Id: [0x000DB22F]
Why is most of it scratched out?

Id: [0x000DB230]
Oh, I um... I'll just tell you. I know this one by heart. The Spartan woman arrived filthy and bleeding from her travels. We cared for her, gave her food, a bath, and she left. Where she went, I do not know. The child... could not be saved.

Id: [0x000DB233]
The baths are for healing the sick, not for washing the blood off one's hands. Leave.

Id: [0x000DB282]
May Asklepios spare her from suffering.

Id: [0x000DB287]
I'm looking for information about a Spartan woman who came through here.

Id: [0x000DB28A]
Is there anything I can do to help?

Id: [0x000DB28B]
I was warned of the Eagle Bearer. "Wants nothing but drachmae for blood," I was told.

Id: [0x000DB2BB]
Will she live?

Id: [0x000DB469]
Here, take this. Though perhaps Hippokrates can teach you something about helping those in need when you speak with him.

Id: [0x000DB46B]
You have my thanks.

Id: [0x000DB46F]
How will I know who I'm looking for?

Id: [0x000DB470]
Head southeast of Hera's Watch, near the Cave of Pan. He'll be standing before a long line of sick people. You'll know him by his bald spot... though I wouldn't mention it.

Id: [0x000DB471]
How will I know when I've found Hippokrates?

Id: [0x000DB472]
Follow the road southeast of Hera's Watch to the Cave of Pan. He won't have set up far from it. Look for a long line of sick people. He's balding, but I wouldn't mention that if I were you.

Id: [0x000DB488]
This way. Over here. If anyone is watching, they'll have my head.

Id: [0x000DB493]
The hetaerae? I've heard they play some sort of role in Korinth, but I assumed it was the same as any other city.

Id: [0x000DB4A3]
Gotarzes. [spits]That goat-fucker. Anyone else ran off like that, they'd be skinned and hung as a warning.

Id: [0x000DB4A4]
I'm not afraid of her.

Id: [0x000DB4A7]
She's pretty mad.

Id: [0x000DB4B3]
I saved his life.

Id: [0x000DB4B5]
You... tortured him! He was just a baby.

Id: [0x000DB4B6]
I taught him to survive! This world is cruel. It demands strength, or death. So I gave him strength.

Id: [0x000DB4C1]
This is for my mother and every family you destroyed.

Id: [0x000DB5DF]
Or the coin.

Id: [0x000DB609]
Still, that iron's worth a lot. Would be a shame to just leave it for someone <i>else</i> to salvage.

Id: [0x000DB60A]
<i>If</i> it's salvage.

Id: [0x000DB81B]
When you walked in, you seemed like you and Sokrates were...

Id: [0x000DB81D]
How I wish you were right. One day we will have that man in here with us. I promise you that.

Id: [0x000DB8D2]
Patience, mercenary.

Id: [0x000DB8D6]
This will only take a moment. I won't keep you away from your patients... and your students?

Id: [0x000DB8D7]
Observation, experience, and experimentation are crucial for treatment. My followers are learning that.

Id: [0x000DB8DC]
I've come from your clinic in Argos. Sostratos asked me to give you this.

Id: [0x000DB8DE]
I knew I forgot some things. Sostratos is a good physician, but a better apprentice there is none.

Id: [0x000DB8E4]
I've been searching for a Spartan woman.

Id: [0x000DB8E5]
What makes you think I would know her?

Id: [0x000DB8E6]
I was told you may have helped her a long time ago.

Id: [0x000DB8E8]
Hippokrates, I need your help.

Id: [0x000DB8EA]
I was told you may have helped my mother. I'm trying to find her.

Id: [0x000DB906]
Maybe the priests at the Sanctuary of Asklepios can help. They keep detailed records of all who pass through.

Id: [0x000DB987]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000DB988]
Hippokrates sent me. Your commander stole his notes, and I think you have them.

Id: [0x000DB989]
The ones written by the great Hippokrates himself? I'm sorry. They were burned in the last attack.

Id: [0x000DB98A]
What?

Id: [0x000DB98B]
You heard me. The medical tent was burned. At least I memorized the notes before we lost them. I'll transcribe them when I have time - or when the war subsides.

Id: [0x000DB9F4]
Sails need repair. Three broken oars on the top level<i>. </i>Two on the second level. Cracked spar.

Id: [0x000DB9F6]
How is he, Hippokrates?

Id: [0x000DB9FC]
[sigh]Never a day's rest, by Zeus...

Id: [0x000DB9FD]
This isn't what we planned.

Id: [0x000DBA00]
The Monger needs to be erased from existence. We'll fight him in a private place, and he'll die. A simple transaction, remember?

Id: [0x000DBA04]
Is this a bad time?

Id: [0x000DBA05]
Every time's a bad time. There's too much work and not enough people to do it. But I'm the only person who cares about that.

Id: [0x000DBA47]
Wait. Did Xenia send you?

Id: [0x000DBA49]
Well thank Poseidon. Finally! Someone competent to help!

Id: [0x000DBA5B]
So it is you. A demi-god in the soot-and-shit streets of Korinth? Killing my men? Helping those fuckin' parasites?

Id: [0x000DBA5C]
That's me.

Id: [0x000DBA5E]
Arrogant, just like your mother.

Id: [0x000DBA5F]
Oh, I fuckin' knew her, all right. She was big fuckin' trouble. But I'll pay her back - when I'm done with you, I'm gonna find your mater, and bring her your fuckin' head.

Id: [0x000DBA61]
Get the fuck outta my city.

Id: [0x000DBA76]
Take his body to the square. Let the people get a last good look at him.

Id: [0x000DBA79]
You wanted a fuckin' show?

Id: [0x000DBA7A]
I wanted you to see the face of every person you've wronged.

Id: [0x000DBA7B]
I'll cover their faces with that precious blood of yours. Just like I shoulda done with Myrrine.

Id: [0x000DBA7C]
Not if I bring her yours first.

Id: [0x000DBA7E]
They won't have much to say after I smash your brains all over the stage.

Id: [0x000DBA81]
Get the fuck off my streets!

Id: [0x000DBAE7]
If she had her way, the Monger would be flayed in the streets. Sparta wants him dealt with quietly.

Id: [0x000DBB0C]
I was Spartan once.

Id: [0x000DBB0D]
Once?

Id: [0x000DBB0E]
Until I was thrown off Mount Taygetos as a child and left for dead.

Id: [0x000DBB10]
You're the daughter of General Nikolaos? All of Sparta knows your name! And here you are - alive - impossible.

Id: [0x000DBD13]
I survived. I raised myself alone while life continued in Sparta.

Id: [0x000DBD33]
It's not yours anymore.

Id: [0x000DBD34]
They're not yours anymore.

Id: [0x000DBD58]
She's not in there.

Id: [0x000DBD99]
I haven't seen you around before, citizen. Perhaps you'd like to spare me conversing with this man of nonsense?

Id: [0x000DCB76]
What do you want to do with him?

Id: [0x000DCB77]
Right now, the Monger rules Korinth. I want to replace him with minimal bloodshed.

Id: [0x000DD5F9]
Never mind being a Spartan. Those of good character will forgive, and should be forgiven.

Id: [0x000DD5FE]
There's no going back now.

Id: [0x000DD5FF]
The displaced can always find their way home. The gods have just decided you must fight for it.

Id: [0x000DD600]
Chin up, Spartan. Easy doesn't exist.

Id: [0x000DD603]
Goodbye, Brasidas.

Id: [0x000DD605]
We'll meet again. [beat]I'm in the fight with you. Show courage.

Id: [0x000DD61B]
You knew Nikolaos.

Id: [0x000DD61C]
A good general, but a stubborn Spartan.

Id: [0x000DD64F]
You don't know anything about Myrrine, do you?

Id: [0x000DD650]
I know that no one should have to endure such tragedy alone.

Id: [0x000DD6E7]
What will it take to get you to understand atoms?

Id: [0x000DD6E8]
I don't even know that guy!

Id: [0x000DD6E9]
Does he live around here?

Id: [0x000DD6ED]
Atoms! The smallest unit of matter.

Id: [0x000DD6EE]
What matters?

Id: [0x000DD6EF]
If it's very small, it can't matter much.

Id: [0x000DD6F0]
Killing him and his men doesn't seem to fit your peaceful proposal.

Id: [0x000DD6F1]
Nothing else has been successful. Trust me.

Id: [0x000DD6F2]
We arrested his top men. Armed the citizens. Tried to stir the polis against him. It never came to be. The only thing left to try -

Id: [0x000DD73E]
Deimos will wish he was watchin' this.

Id: [0x000DD761]
She was big fuckin' trouble. But I'll pay her back. When I'm done with you, I'm gonna find your mater and bring her your fuckin' head.

Id: [0x000DD76B]
I was told I would find you here.

Id: [0x000DD76C]
I'm not the type that likes to be found.  What do you want?

Id: [0x000DD76D]
I wish to speak with Alexios of Sparta.

Id: [0x000DD76E]
And what makes you think that I am this Alexios?

Id: [0x000DD778]
I was told he travels with an eagle.

Id: [0x000DD779]
Betrayed by my friend Ikaros? Tracking someone called the Messenger of Zeus doesn't scare you? Many in these lands view me as a son of the gods.

Id: [0x000DD77F]
Some, like myself, only see a man with an eagle.

Id: [0x000DD780]
So be it. What do you want?

Id: [0x000DD782]
I mist say, I would be inclined to believe the legends.

Id: [0x000DD783]
Then you are brave to stand in my path.  Why are you here?

Id: [0x000DD787]
I was told that this mercenary carries a broken spear.

Id: [0x000DD788]
Yes, it's an unusual weapon, but a dangerous one.

Id: [0x000DD789]
Why is it broken?

Id: [0x000DD78A]
This spear belonged to my grandfather Leonidas, king of Sparta, and was shattered at the great Battle of Thermopylae.  He held it in combat until his last breath.  But enough with this.  Why are you here?

Id: [0x000DD795]
Well I was told this man is as physically gifted as Apollo himself.

Id: [0x000DD796]
Well I am skilled in hiding in the shadows, but only a miracle from the gods could hide this pretty face from envy and desire.  Is it the fire of lust I see burning in your eyes?

Id: [0x000DD79A]
No, you have this all wrong, I'm not looking for love.

Id: [0x000DD79B]
I'm relieved. Why are you here?

Id: [0x000DD7A1]
I can't say that I'm immune to your charms...

Id: [0x000DD7A2]
I can't blame you.  But today is a business day.  Why are your really here for?

Id: [0x000DD7A5]
I'm interested in your story, in knowing who you are.  I was told that your tale is akin to living myth! I have a few questions.

Id: [0x000DD7A6]
No one is careless enough to track me down to only ask me questions unless...Unless you are a piece of skata [[shit]] from the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x000DD7A7]
The Cult of Kosmos? What is that?

Id: [0x000DD7A8]
Your eyes are sincere, perhaps you tell the truth.  The Cult of Kosmos controls who governs this world: they  are a secret society, housed by the Oracles of Delphi - shadows- who guide the hands of societal power.

Id: [0x000DD7B0]
So they are priests?

Id: [0x000DD7B1]
Not exactly.  They are powerful people from all around the Greek world who control the words of the oracle and bend their actions to their will.  They are state rulers, stratagois, Ephors, generals, scholars... They influence men, they pull all the strings.

Id: [0x000DD7B3]
How can they have all this power through the oracle? People listen to them?

Id: [0x000DD7B4]
People believe that they speak the words of the gods.  No one defies the will of the gods.  Not even the great Sokrates.

Id: [0x000DD7B7]
No one except you I would guess?

Id: [0x000DD7B8]
I'm different I can see their lies where others cannot.  Some say I am closer to the gods than most.  I have certain abilities...

Id: [0x000DD7C6]
No, I believe you, great warrior.

Id: [0x000DD7C8]
I'm here to learn about you, not to test your strength.

Id: [0x000DD7CA]
You seem to have hate for these Ancients. Why do you care about their actions?

Id: [0x000DD7CB]
They have destroyed my family...

Id: [0x000DD7CE]
They've murdered them?

Id: [0x000DD7CF]
Murder? Ha! They tried, but no... They've done far worse.  They've separated us. Dishonored us.  Lied to us.  Taken away our Spartan citizenship and left us to suffer alone.

Id: [0x000DD7D2]
Maybe you need to rethink your priorities… What could be worse than Death?

Id: [0x000DD7D3]
Spartans do not fear death. But family is sacred in Sparta, it’s all that matters.  My father… my mother … my sister… They brought chaos and uncertainty to perfect order. [beat] But I will find them and reunite us all.

Id: [0x000DD7D7]
Order needs a certain chaos to evolve into something stronger.

Id: [0x000DD7D8]
Wise words, you sound like my friend Sokrates of Athens. Who are you anyway stranger?

Id: [0x000DD7DB]
That's a very philosophical way to look at it.

Id: [0x000DD7DC]
My travels have opened my eyes to a bigger, more complex world.  Or perhaps my new friend Sokrates of Athens has more influence on me that I thought.  Who are you anyway stranger?

Id: [0x000DD7E0]
Ah yes, I haven’t introduced myself.  I’m Yvos Guillamos, a business man. I make a living from gathering stories and telling them to the world.

Id: [0x000DD7E1]
A merchant historian? I've been helped by a man named Herodotos, he's a bit like you.  I guess my story is pretty unusual.  So what do you want to know?

Id: [0x000DD7E3]
Oh yes I haven’t introduced myself.  I’m Yvos Guillamos, I’m just a man with a passion for great stories.

Id: [0x000DD7E4]
You remind me of my friend Herotodus.  So tell me, what else do you want to know?

Id: [0x000DD7F5]
Tell me more about what happened to your family.

Id: [0x000DD7F6]
My lineage possesses strange and great abilities that the Cult of Kosmos, those snakes, have deemed dangerous. When my sister was born, they tricked the Spartan elders into sacrificing her at Mount Taygetos, saying a false prophecy warned that she would bring doom to Sparta. I tried to fight back… I was strong but not  strong enough. I was only seven years old…

Id: [0x000DD7F7]
And what happened?

Id: [0x000DD7F8]
I killed an Ancient as the threw my sister down the mountain... In front of all of Sparta.  The leaders of Sparta ordered my father to avenge my murderous action and restore our family name.  My father threw me off the cliff.

Id: [0x000DD7F9]
Oh my...

Id: [0x000DD7FB]
I am new to this part of the world. You seem to know a lot about these regions.

Id: [0x000DD7FC]
It might seem this way, but I'm discovering this land as I go.  You see, most of my youth was spent on a small island in the west.

Id: [0x000DD7FE]
You've answered all I came here to ask.

Id: [0x000DD805]
Let's change the subject.

Id: [0x000DD807]
How did you survive?

Id: [0x000DD808]
I don’t know. I woke up at the bottom of the mountain.  Ikaros was pecking at my head. I knew I could not go back to Sparta, so I fled.  Although I was young, I still had these... abnormal abilities, so I survived doing what I could do best.

Id: [0x000DD809]
And you became a mercenary.

Id: [0x000DD80A]
Yes and a pretty good one for that matter. Until recently, this was the life on a small island named Kephallonia. But news of my family came to me with the winds of war... So I set out to find them.

Id: [0x000DD80C]
Did you find your father?

Id: [0x000DD80D]
My father is the only one that benefitted from the event. Sparta saw his action as the ultimate sacrifice for the good of the state and promoted him as a general. He was in Megaris when I found him.

Id: [0x000DD80E]
How was the reunion?

Id: [0x000DD80F]
I.. I was tricked by the Order who offered me ten thousand drachmae for his head. I didn’t know the contact was from them. He didn’t recognize me when I found him.

Id: [0x000DD810]
Did you choose to kill him? He did try to kill you.

Id: [0x000DD811]
It's something that I would rather not discuss.

Id: [0x000DD813]
You are looking for your mother? Where is she?

Id: [0x000DD814]
I recently learned that when the oracles condemned my sister to death seventeen years ago, my mother fled Sparta in grief. The pain of losing both her children was too much to bear.  My quest to find her has taken me all across the Aegean Sea. So far, I’ve learned that she changed her identity and took the body of my baby sister to the sanctuary of Asklepios near Argos.

Id: [0x000DD815]
She changed her identity?

Id: [0x000DD816]
The snakes of the Cult of Kosmos have tried to find her. I have to find her before they do.

Id: [0x000DD818]
The death of your younger sister is tragic.

Id: [0x000DD819]
My sister survived the fall. She is alive.

Id: [0x000DD827]
She is alive! Terrific news!

Id: [0x000DD828]
Yes... but unfortunately she is not free.

Id: [0x000DD82A]
The Order got their hands on my baby sister when she was fighting for her life and raised her to be the most feared warrior in the world. They filled her with lies and anger. They named her Deimos… She is such a destructive force and feared by many.

Id: [0x000DD82B]
Why do they need her?

Id: [0x000DD82C]
While she’s the perfect warrior, the perfect assassin, they need her to find and retrieve these artifacts from the gods. It would seem that our lineage is the only one that can manipulate these objects. I don’t know much about those…. All I know is that I must find my sister and stop her.

Id: [0x000DD82D]
Will you kill her?

Id: [0x000DD82E]
Only the gods know.

Id: [0x000DD830]
Why bother throwing you off of the mountain if you all survive?

Id: [0x000DD831]
Ha! Well, my family is strong. This why the Order hunts us.

Id: [0x000DD83A]
Please: tell me about some of the places you've discovered during your journey?

Id: [0x000DD83B]
While my journey has been a very challenging one, I must say that exploring this world has been a rich and personal journey.  I feel like I’ve been discovering a new world and home at the same time.  Like Odysseus, to a certain extent.

Id: [0x000DD83C]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000DD83D]
I’ve heard of all these places as child.  Athens, Delphi, Olympia, Korinthia, Argos. They feel familiar, their names are almost mythic, but since then, I’ve been able to discover them for myself.  I’ve heard about the Parthenon in Athens in stories, but to stand on top of the Acropolis and marvel at the city… Malaka, those Athenians have built a city like no other.

Id: [0x000DD83E]
What you saw impressed you?

Id: [0x000DD83F]
I didn’t just see, I lived. My journey made me experience moments few ever will. Through my journey I’ve been invited to a symposium at the mighty Perikles’ house and mingled with all the philosophers and artists of Athens. I’ve discovered the tomb of the great king Agamemnon, sat at the Pnyx and witnessed the Athenians debate. I’ve raced at the Olympics. I’ve even explored the mythical labyrinth of Knossos.

Id: [0x000DD840]
The Labyrinth of the Minotaur? You must be exaggerating.  It is only a legend.

Id: [0x000DD841]
You call me a liar, Malaka? The blood of the creature stains my skin! There are many secrets in this world, Yvos.

Id: [0x000DD846]
You talked about the historian, Herodotos.  Did you meet any other people of interest in your travels?

Id: [0x000DD847]
Of course.  Many of them are my friends now.  The Order sees more progressive people as threats to their power, so I share a common enemy with the brightest minds of this world. Take Hippokrates, for example. His studies in medicine have put him at odds with the priests of the sanctuary of Asklepios. Through my investigation, I discovered the Order was trying to discredit him.

Id: [0x000DD848]
What did you learn from Hippokrates?

Id: [0x000DD849]
He is a man of honor. Dedicated to the health of his patients, he has sworn to help anyone regardless of if they are Spartan or Athenian, rich or poor, man or woman.  He has taught me to consider the life of a living being. He teaches me a valuable lesson every day, as he now travels with me as part of my crew.

Id: [0x000DD84A]
You have a ship?

Id: [0x000DD84B]
Of course!  My navigator, Barnabas, he’s quite a character, and has taught me that many soldiers in this world need a second chance. So I recruit them. [laughing to himself] It makes Hippokrates happy that I do not kill everyone I meet.

Id: [0x000DD84C]
Did you meet other people?

Id: [0x000DD84D]
Of course. Perikles and Aspasia leaders of Athens;  Sophokles, Euripides and Aristophanes the playwrights; Phidias the master sculptor, Brasidas the Spartan General; many great philosophers, just to name a few.

Id: [0x000DD84E]
Philosophers? Tell me about your friend Sokrates!

Id: [0x000DD84F]
It was not love at first sight. He is irritating, troublesome, and never wears shoes... but he has taught me much.  He’s taught me to unlearn what I think I know and seek the truth.  It has allowed me to see things differently, especially when dealing with politicians like Kleon whose false promises stretch across all the Greek World.

Id: [0x000DD850]
Kleon? He lies?

Id: [0x000DD851]
He uses his popularity to make bold statements to control public opinion. He doesn’t seek the truth, he exploits it to serve himself, but most Athenians believe him.  He’s becoming more popular than Perikles in this time of war. He is dangerous. I guess this is the problem with Athenian democracy, it’s a popularity contest.

Id: [0x000DD852]
I can see similarities with the world I come from. Why do you care? You are a mercenary.

Id: [0x000DD853]
I've learned that Kleon is part of the order and he will die by my spear.

Id: [0x000DD85D]
You've said the world is at war.  Who is fighting?

Id: [0x000DD85E]
People say that the world has always been at war.  But this war is different.

Id: [0x000DD85F]
How so?

Id: [0x000DD860]
My grandfather, Leonidas of Sparta, fought alongside the Athenians and Arkadians to destroy the Persian threat. They fought to keep our land free. But this war divides us. The Greek city states are forced to choose a side. The war has taken on epic proportions.

Id: [0x000DD861]
A world war?

Id: [0x000DD862]
You could say that. We’ve also lost the honor and respect that our ancestor cultivated. This is a war for <i>kleos</i> [[glory]], for riches, to win at all cost. The end shall see the true super-power of Greece.

Id: [0x000DD863]
A mercenary like you would benefit from such a conflict.

Id: [0x000DD864]
I can’t complain; business has been great. But it has attracted the most fierce mercenaries from across the Aegean Sea. You must believe me when I say that these are dangerous times.

Id: [0x000DD866]
You've answered my questions about this world.

Id: [0x000DD868]
Your story is quite interesting, thank you for answering all my questions.

Id: [0x000DD869]
Hold on, <i>xenos </i>[[stranger]].  I don't do anything for free.

Id: [0x000DD86D]
Of course. Here, take this Alexios.

Id: [0x000DD86E]
Generous.  This is twice the amount that I was paid to follow <i>you.</i>

Id: [0x000DD870]
I got what I wanted, and I don't owe you anything.

Id: [0x000DD871]
Feisty, eh? I can respect that.  My purse is already full from taking the contract to follow <i>you.</i>

Id: [0x000DD875]
Who paid you?

Id: [0x000DD876]
They are watching you right now.  People with great interest in what you have to say.

Id: [0x000DD877]
They want me dead?

Id: [0x000DD878]
Dead? No, they seem to be on your side.  They asked me to get an answer from you.  Actually they wish to hear you say only two words.

Id: [0x000DD879]
Allies that need answers? I can live with that.  What are these words?

Id: [0x000DD87A]
"Strong Go."

Id: [0x000DD87F]
Strong go!

Id: [0x000DD880]
I think they will be very pleased. Thank you, great Yvos.

Id: [0x000DD882]
These words need meditation, I need to consult my oracles.

Id: [0x000DD883]
I understand. I will come back later.

Id: [0x000DD888]
I have more questions that only they can answer. I must speak to their leaders.

Id: [0x000DD889]
Very well, I will summon them. You will recognize them easily.  They have the looks of Apollo and Herakles.

Id: [0x000DD88C]
May our paths cross again.

Id: [0x000DD892]
Abilities? That sounds a bit supernatural.

Id: [0x000DD893]
I am blessed with gifts of the gods.  I have the sight of the eagle and a swiftness in combat that would make the envy of the great Achilles.  Do you want to put me to the test?

Id: [0x000DD899]
Behind you, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x000DD89A]
Here come some more!

Id: [0x000DEC7F]
[grunt]You'll have to be stronger than that!

Id: [0x000DEC81]
Again! Up!

Id: [0x000DEC82]
[sigh]Yes, <i>Pater</i>.

Id: [0x000DEC84]
Ready your staff.

Id: [0x000DEC86]
That's enough, Nikolaos. The sun's going down.

Id: [0x000DEC89]
Time to eat - don't you think?

Id: [0x000DEC8D]
What are we eating tonight?

Id: [0x000DEC93]
Tonight we are having baby Alexios. And what a feast he will be!

Id: [0x000DEC95]
No, not him! Take me instead, I'm tasty!

Id: [0x000DEC97]
Yes, yes, you're all sweet as honey, now, come inside. The lamb's turning black!

Id: [0x000DEC99]
Here. Lay him in his bed.

Id: [0x000DEC9A]
Yes, <i>Pater</i>.

Id: [0x000DECAF]
Silence!

Id: [0x000DECB2]
Murderer! She has killed him!

Id: [0x000DECB3]
Toss her over!

Id: [0x000DECB5]
Nooo! [breath]No, [cry]no.

Id: [0x000DECB7]
Pay for her dishonor! For the life she has snuffed! She's not Spartan, Nikolaos!

Id: [0x000DECB9]
...<i>Pater</i>.

Id: [0x000DECBB]
<i>Pater</i>!

Id: [0x000DECBD]
Your blood is tainted! Rid yourself of this poison! For Sparta!

Id: [0x000DECC0]
Don't give in! Let him have it!

Id: [0x000DECC2]
A Spartan rises as soon as they've fallen.

Id: [0x000DECC3]
Widen your stance. A soldier grounds themselves.

Id: [0x000DECC5]
[hmm]Good, good.[ah]

Id: [0x000DECC6]
Got you![laughs]

Id: [0x000DECD8]
We are ready, my king.

Id: [0x000DECD9]
Tell me, Dienekes, have you ever gone fishing with your son?

Id: [0x000DECDA]
[exhale]No, never. A soldier's life is all I've had the honor to know.

Id: [0x000DECDB]
[hmm]I would have liked to have gone fishing with my son.

Id: [0x000DECDD]
But now...

Id: [0x000DECDF]
Let us meet our fate, shall we?

Id: [0x000DECF1]
Spartans! Every breath that you have taken, has led you to this moment. Every drop of blood, sweat and tear, all of it, has led to where you stand right now.

Id: [0x000DECFB]
For our sons!

Id: [0x000DED14]
For our daughters!

Id: [0x000DED5D]
The Persians come to make slaves of us all. I have a better idea. I say we drench the gods with their blood.

Id: [0x000DED5F]
What say you Spartans?

Id: [0x000DEFBB]
The oracle has spoken! To prevent Sparta's fall, the child must fall first.

Id: [0x000DEFBC]
You can't let this happen!

Id: [0x000DEFBE]
[breath]Please! He'll do no harm - he'll help us! He will lead us!

Id: [0x000DEFC4]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x000DEFC6]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x000DF372]
Today was a day the Persians will never forget. [ono - remove spear]

Dienekes!

Id: [0x000DF3A2]
We are betrayed, my king. Xerxes knows of the path behind the mountain. They are coming.

Id: [0x000DF3B5]
Gather the men.

Id: [0x000DF3BC]
Which sequence would you like to start?

Id: [0x000DF3BF]
Welcome, welcome friend! I have quite the plethora of ice cream flavors for you to choose from, amongst which, the Goat Milk and Nuts flavor is our best seller!

Id: [0x000DF3C8]
Goat Milk and Nuts? That's funny, it reminds me of... Someone.

Id: [0x000DF3C9]
So, would you like to have one?

Id: [0x000DF3CA]
Heh, no thanks. I feel like it might leave an unwanted taste in my mouth.

Id: [0x000DF3CB]
Oh, it's a shame. Really, you have no idea what you're missing.

Id: [0x000DF3CD]
Argh! In Hade's name, I'll be damned if I don't try everything at least once. I'll take two scoops in a hard shell.

Id: [0x000DF3CE]
There you go!

Id: [0x000DF3E5]
Would you have something less, exotic?

Id: [0x000DF3E6]

Id: [0x000DF3F4]
Here, have one of my favorites: Chocolate flavored!

Id: [0x000DF3F5]
You know what, I think... I think I'll have to pass. I have a mother to find and perhaps even a sibling.

Id: [0x000DF3F8]
Here, have one of my favorites: Vanilla flavored!

Hey Sokrates, would you kindly pick a number from one to five for me? There is that person I need to pursue and kill and I was wondering how many seconds of leeway I should give him.

Id: [0x000DF40D]
In which case, I would choose Six!

Id: [0x000DF40E]
But six is not a possible choice within the One to Five parameter!

Id: [0x000DF40F]
Is it really not?

Id: [0x000DF410]
...

Id: [0x000DF412]
I never expected you to lose your tongue.

Id: [0x000DF414]
I am unsure what I'd prefer, pick one for me.

Id: [0x000DF564]
Hello! Now is the time to check many, many things for the Automatic Playback feature.

Id: [0x000DF565]
That's good to know!

Id: [0x000DF56C]
This is the Main Path number 2.

Id: [0x000DF571]
Congratulations, you've reached the end of the Main Path!

Id: [0x000DF572]
That makes me proud!

Id: [0x000DF575]
This is the Main Path number 1.

Id: [0x000DF57C]
Wow! I can't believe you have managed to reach the first hidden path!

Id: [0x000DF57D]
Absolutely crazy, right? Albeit this felt like a walk through a park's main way.

Id: [0x000DF57E]
Let's see if you can handle a HUB.

Id: [0x000DF580]
This is getting complicated, this will split in three paths!

Id: [0x000DF581]
I think I will start by path number...

Id: [0x000DF586]
This is the Main Path number 3.

Id: [0x000DF589]
This is the Main Path number 4.

Id: [0x000DF58D]
This is the Main 2 Path 1 sequence. An excellent choice, but not the best! You might want to reconsider your options.

Id: [0x000DF58E]
This is the Main 2 Path 2 sequence. An excellent choice, but still a dead end!

Id: [0x000DF58F]
This is the Main 2 Path 3 sequence. An excellent choice! Here comes the Random Switch! Only one of these choices will unlock the next hidden path!

Id: [0x000DF648]
Hesitation only hastens -

Id: [0x000DF649]
- the grave. I know, mater.

Id: [0x000DF64B]
Your form is improving, your resolve is strong. But you're not taking action.

Id: [0x000DF64C]
I was going to!

Id: [0x000DF64D]
I know. But it's the moments in between that decide everything. [sigh]

Id: [0x000DF64F]
Your turn.

Id: [0x000DF651]
Leonidas's spear!

Id: [0x000DF652]
You're old enough now. My father's spear holds a certain burden, but... you're ready.

Id: [0x000DF654]
I felt something.

Id: [0x000DF655]
Oh?

Id: [0x000DF656]
This spear... it has magic.

Id: [0x000DF65C]
But not everyone understands that. Some recognize the power we bear, and want it only for themselves. They will try to take it from us.

Id: [0x000DF7A6]
It carries with it a long line of power. A bloodline of incredible heroes - the same blood within you and me. And our family.

Id: [0x000DF7A7]
All of us?

Id: [0x000DF7A8]
Think of Leonidas. He had <i>great </i>courage. And he made a great sacrifice. You share in his blood, and the strength he possessed.

Id: [0x000DF7AA]
We are able to feel certain things happening around us. That is our family's gift.

Id: [0x000DF82B]
I know. You're a warrior. If we keep moving forward - always moving forward - we're untouchable.

Id: [0x000DF858]
Good luck!

Id: [0x000DF859]
I don't need any, the script will pick them all anyway.

Id: [0x000DF860]
You got Random 1! You actually had as much chance to get this fake output as you did for the real one! What a bummer.

Id: [0x000DF861]
Let me try again, or meet my blade. You want a Random Switch on that one?

Id: [0x000DF862]
...

Id: [0x000DF864]
You got Random 2! It is actually only a filler, but I will give you one more chance!

Id: [0x000DF866]
You got Random 3! This one too, is only a filler!

Id: [0x000DF867]
Please, don't take it personal.<LF>As a wise man once said: I never mean anything, I am just exploring your ideas.

Id: [0x000DF869]
Congratulation! You landed on Random 4. Do I hear a hidden path opening in the distance!?

Id: [0x000DF86A]
I can't count on you to check for me. Right?

Id: [0x000DF875]
Wow, you just went through two HUBs in a row, this is going to make a lot of choices and paths!

Id: [0x000DF876]
Where am I now?

Id: [0x000DF877]
You are in the Main Path 4, HUB 1, Path A.

Id: [0x000DF878]
This makes my head hurt.

Id: [0x000DF879]
I understand, do you want to continue?

Id: [0x000DF87C]
Well that is disappointing, I expected more coming from a Misthios like you.

Id: [0x000DF87D]
I am not giving you a choice, you have to go on!

Id: [0x000DF883]
Let's keep this one simple!

Id: [0x000DF886]
I haven't fought my way through Spartans and Romans army to be defeated by a somewhat advanced brain tease!

Id: [0x000DF887]
Well said, friend. Well said! Here comes the next zone.

Id: [0x000DF888]
I think I have about enough.

Id: [0x000DF88A]
Let me guess, I am in Main 4 - Hub 1 - Path B?

Id: [0x000DF88B]
Impressive!

Id: [0x000DF88C]
Go in the next sequence and I'll unlock another path!

Id: [0x000DF88E]
Boom! I have unlocked Main Path 3 for you!

Id: [0x000DF890]
This is Main 4 - Hub 1 - Path C, and the last path on this Hub.

Id: [0x000DF891]
Hoorays!

Id: [0x000DF893]
How boring, let's try Option B, shall we?

Id: [0x000DF894]
Why not?

Id: [0x000DF896]
I lied! Hahaha, you just entered a randomized, random zone!

Id: [0x000DF897]
Bloody heaven! What have I done!?

Id: [0x000DF898]
There's no coming back, for now!

Id: [0x000DF8A3]
For some very unknown reasons, I feel compelled to say: Potato!

Id: [0x000DF8A5]
For some very unknown reasons, I feel compelled to say: Pumpkin!

Id: [0x000DF8A7]
For some very unknown reasons, I feel compelled to say: Carrot!

Id: [0x000DF8A9]
For some very unknown reasons, I feel compelled to say: Chocolate!

Id: [0x000DF8AB]
For some very unknown reasons, I feel compelled to say: Vanilla!

Id: [0x000DF8AD]
For some very unknown reasons, I feel compelled to say: Caramel!

Id: [0x000DF8B0]
Welcome! I know you probably expect this path to go through many hubs, variables and random switches. However, I have something else in mind.

Id: [0x000DF8B1]
Let me tell you a story about a king of Phrygia. A king named, Midas.

Id: [0x000DF8B2]
One day some of his farmhands brought him a satyr they had caught napping in the vineyard. This creature, part man, part goat, still groggy and much the worse for wear, had been thoroughly trussed up to keep him from escaping. Midas immediately recognized Silenus, right-hand satyr to the god Dionysus, and ordered him set free.

Id: [0x000DF8B3]
Silenus explained that he and his master had just returned from the East where they had been engaged in spreading the cultivation of the grape. Dionysus had brought back a tiger or two, an ever-expanding flock of followers and one very drunken satyr. Silenus had conked out in Midas's vineyard to sleep it off. Now he was grateful to the king for treating him with dignity, and so was Dionysus. The god was so pleased, in fact, that he offered to grant whatever Midas should wish for.<LF>

Id: [0x000DF8B4]
What did Midas ask for?

Id: [0x000DF8B5]
Interesting question, but I believe you should be asking: How did he decide what to ask for?

Id: [0x000DF8B6]
You see, you didn't get to rule a kingdom in those days without a pretty active grasp of what makes for a successful economy. He didn't have to think twice. As the simplest plan for the constant replenishment of the royal treasury, he asked that everything he touch be turned to gold.

Id: [0x000DF8B7]
Arching a godly eyebrow, Dionysus went so far as to ask if Midas were sure. To which the king instantly replied, Sure I'm sure. So Dionysus waved his pinebranch sceptre and conferred the boon.

Id: [0x000DF8B8]
And Midas rushed back home to try it out. Tentatively at first, he laid a trembling fingertip upon a bowl of fruit and then a stool and then a wooly lambkin. And when each of these had been transmuted in a trice into purest gold, the king began to caper about like the lambkin before its transformation.

Id: [0x000DF8B9]
"Just look at this!" he crowed, turning his chariot into a glittering mass of priceless-though-worthless transportation. "Look what daddy can do!" he cried, taking his young daughter by the hand to lead her into the garden for a lesson in making dewy nature gleam with a monotonous but more valuable sheen.

Id: [0x000DF8BA]
Uh oh!

Id: [0x000DF8BB]
Encountering unexpected resistance, he swung about to see why his daughter was being such a slug. Whereupon his eyes encountered, where late his child had been, a life-size golden statue that might have been entitled "Innocence Surprised".

Id: [0x000DF8BC]
Uh oh, said Midas, and from that point on the uh-oh's multiplied. He couldn't touch any useful object without it losing in utility what it gained in monetary value, nor any food without it shedding all nutritional potency on its leaden way down his gullet.

Id: [0x000DF8BD]
What happened next!?

Id: [0x000DF8BE]
In short, Midas came to understand why Dionysus had looked askance when asked to grant the favor. Fortunately, the god was a good sport about it. He allowed Midas to wash away his magic touch in the river Pactolus, which ever after enjoyed renown for its shimmering deposits of gold.

Id: [0x000DF8BF]
What about his daughter?

Id: [0x000DF8C0]
That, we will never know.

Id: [0x000DF8C2]
So, when am I reaching the Minotaur? Where's the middle of this maze?

Id: [0x000DF8C5]
Hurray! Looks like we have gone through all the available choices!

Xerxes! You coward! You want me? Come and get me!

Id: [0x000E095F]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>. How was Megaris?

Id: [0x000E0960]
SKREE!

Id: [0x000E0961]
I'll make sure Markos doesn't have unexpected visitors.

Id: [0x000E0964]
It's good to see you again, Perikles.

Id: [0x000E0965]
And you as well. I only wish it were under better circumstances. [beat]And who's this?

Id: [0x000E0969]
Welcome, Kassandra. And what did you think of your first taste of Athens?

Id: [0x000E0A79]
[laughs]By dawn you'll be completely surrounded!

Id: [0x000E0A7A]
We are Spartans, when are we not.

Id: [0x000E0A7B]
Spartans![spits]

Id: [0x000E0B23]
[huh] Storm's coming in.

Id: [0x000E0B24]
Then maybe we should move forward now.

Id: [0x000E0B25]
I told you - I've paid Markos enough.

Id: [0x000E103E]
This is an AFX Test for Projected

Id: [0x000E103F]
This is an AFX Test for Yell

Id: [0x000E1040]
This is an AFX Test for Whisper

Id: [0x000E1092]
First, check on my colleague, Metiochos. He was meant to meet me today, and it's not like him to miss an appointment.

Id: [0x000E11B3]
You tell Markos I've paid enough already! I won't bow to - to - to a mercenary! Or to someone foolish enough to borrow money from the Cyclops.

Id: [0x000E11C3]
That word will mean nothing when Xerxes wipes your bloodline from the face of th -[ono]

Id: [0x000E11C5]
Tomorrow is a day the world will remember.

Id: [0x000E11F9]
Enough!

Id: [0x000E11FD]
We have grown tired of your insolent tongue! Sparta will <i>not</i> go to war, the Pythia has spoken!

Id: [0x000E11FE]
The Pythia says what you tell her to say! She's been your puppet for far too long, the time has come to cut her strings!

Id: [0x000E11FF]
Oh Leonidas, the days of heroes are over. You think your blood makes you special? If we opened your veins it would spill to the ground and disappear through the cracks. You are no one.

Id: [0x000E1201]
You are more than welcome to find out.

Id: [0x000E1203]
Your fate is sealed, Son of the Lion. Xerxes will unite us. He will bring order to chaos.

Id: [0x000E1204]
Defy the Pythia, and everyone you love, everything you stand for, will perish.

Id: [0x000E12C0]
Kassandra. Good news, I hope.

Id: [0x000E12C1]
Safe and sound.

Id: [0x000E136D]
Well done. [beat]And now the shroud is yours.

Id: [0x000E13E0]
What do you say?

Id: [0x000E14F8]
Splendid. [beat]You'll need a boat. You have one, don't you?

Id: [0x000E1544]
He'd better have my money, Markos. I'd hate to have to sell <i>our</i> vineyard.

Id: [0x000E1572]
My king?

Id: [0x000E1573]
If Xerxes wants Sparta, he'll have to go through me.

Id: [0x000E1740]
You are my greatest pride. Remember that. You'll bring this family to glory. Go.

Id: [0x000E1742]
Who's there? Come out!

Id: [0x000E1744]
I won't let them.

Id: [0x000E1885]
Look at me Nikolaos! Don't! [cry]Don't listen! Nikolaos! Don't listen!

Id: [0x000E1898]
Stay back.

Id: [0x000E189A]
She's no threat to Perikles, I assure you.

Id: [0x000E189B]
Ah, Herodotos.

Id: [0x000E18A2]
Alexios!

Id: [0x000E18FF]
Done.

Id: [0x000E1900]
Yes, there's an ostracism vote taking place that could use your... influence.

Id: [0x000E1901]
Phidias... the famous sculptor? What did he do, exactly?

Id: [0x000E1902]
Ostracism?

Id: [0x000E1903]
It's between the sophist, Anaxagoras, and another man. On trial for impiety. My contact near the agora will give you the details.

Id: [0x000E1A79]
You're the sorriest band of thieves I've ever seen.

Id: [0x000E1AA0]
He stands accused of multiple offenses and is awaiting trial. You'll find him under close guard at his workshop.

Id: [0x000E1AA3]
I'll do it.

Id: [0x000E1D03]
It's a fine ship, Telemenes.

Id: [0x000E1D04]
She is that, ready to ride the waves for the right captain... and the right price.

Id: [0x000E1D0A]
What'll it take for you to part with her?

Id: [0x000E1D0B]
Oh, couldn't let her go for less than 100,000.

Id: [0x000E1D0C]
100,000! Who has that much?

Id: [0x000E1D0D]
Someone who's serious about buying a ship. You think craftsmanship like this is given away?

Id: [0x000E1D0F]
I really need a boat, Telemenes.

Id: [0x000E1D10]
Everyone on Kephallonia needs a boat, or passage on one. You've seen this shit hole.

Id: [0x000E1D11]
All my life.

Id: [0x000E1D13]
You must be the one Perikles sent.

Id: [0x000E1D17]
Of course he didn't. That's what I'm for.

Id: [0x000E1D22]
If you have the money we can talk, if not... I've work to do.

Id: [0x000E1D27]
Wha... What are y... Please, please just leave.

Id: [0x000E1D3C]
You don't look like murderers, was that the Spartans' mistake?

Id: [0x000E1D3F]
If someone is exiled, can they return?

Id: [0x000E1D42]
If they do, they'll be punished.

Id: [0x000E1D64]
It's too late for talk now. I came to find who's behind this crime against Sparta.

Id: [0x000E1D65]
You'd better tell me why I shouldn't just kill you and return the goods.

Id: [0x000E1D66]
Please, I'll tell you anything you want to know.

Id: [0x000E1D80]
We either die here by your hand, or slowly starve later...

Id: [0x000E1D81]
If I'm to die, I would rather die fighting.

Id: [0x000E1D83]
Stand aside, you don't need to die today. I'm returning the supplies to the Spartans.

Id: [0x000E1D84]
Then you will do so over our dead bodies!

Id: [0x000E1D85]
Don't be stupid. Take some of the food, enough to get by. I'll say I killed you and claimed what was left. They will be satisfied.

Id: [0x000E1D86]
But the food, what of our families?!

Id: [0x000E1D87]
Your families will not benefit from your death. Accept my offer and don't steal again. It won't be me who comes for you next time.

Id: [0x000E1D88]
Yes, <i>misthios</i>... Thank you.

Id: [0x000E1E1C]
It's done.

Id: [0x000E1E1D]
Hm, you work quickly.

Id: [0x000E1EE1]
Please, we're not thieves. This is our food, our crops. They took it, left us with nothing! Our children are starving...

Id: [0x000E1EE2]
Explain yourselves! It's not wise to anger the Spartans.

Id: [0x000E1EE5]
By the gods no! We're citizens of Megara. Please, show mercy. This war has already cost us dearly.

Id: [0x000E1EF0]
We're ready when you are, captain.

Id: [0x000E1EF2]
[&ah]Wait for me, Kassandra! I'm all packed and everything!

Id: [0x000E1EF4]
Wait!

Id: [0x000E1F06]
The votes have been tallied.

Id: [0x000E1F08]
Overwhelmingly, the people have decided that Anaxagoras should be ostracized from Athens.

Id: [0x000E1F4D]
Did you find the ones responsible?

Id: [0x000E1F51]
They won't trouble you again.

Id: [0x000E1FAF]
Kephallonia's the only place you've ever known. You'd leave your home?

Id: [0x000E1FB2]
[&breath]You can't go where I'm going. I need to be alone.

Id: [0x000E1FB4]
Who's going to keep you company?

Id: [0x000E1FCA]
Chara?

Id: [0x000E1FCB]
My pet eagle. She's my friend. <i>Mater</i> gave her to me.

Id: [0x000E1FCE]
If I can't come, then take Chara.

Id: [0x000E2012]
Relax. Perikles sent me.

Id: [0x000E2032]
Prepare to cast off. It's time to leave.

Id: [0x000E2033]
Good. The tides wait for neither man nor woman.

Id: [0x000E2038]
I need a bit more time on the island. I'll be back when I'm ready.

Id: [0x000E2039]
I'll be waiting.

Id: [0x000E2062]
I'm proud to fight by your side.

Id: [0x000E2065]
Yes... You have earned your place.

Id: [0x000E206C]
We will win the day for Sparta and the Wolf. Come, we must reach the forward camp.

Id: [0x000E207D]
I got your message.

Id: [0x000E2089]
Good. The Wolf has ordered the attack. I'm glad you're here to join us in our march to glory.

Id: [0x000E210E]
Stop! I can't let you go any further.

Id: [0x000E2178]
We shouldn't delay here any further. Even rats like these have friends on Kephallonia.

Id: [0x000E217F]
I can't thank you enough. After spending most of my life at sea, it would have been absolutely shameful to drown in a pot!

Id: [0x000E219C]
So, why were those men attacking you?

Id: [0x000E219D]
Oh, you know the people here... No offense. I tell them a tale of my last voyage, and the next thing I know they're acting like a bunch of savages!

Id: [0x000E21A9]
Kleon mentioned me? That's going to hurt Perikles. First impiety, now theft. After all we've done for this city...

Id: [0x000E21B8]
South of Athens, there's an island called Seriphos. My friend Theras lives there. When I discovered the plot against me, I sent word to him. If anyone can help us, he can.

Id: [0x000E224E]
What tale could you tell that would make them so angry?

Id: [0x000E224F]
My last voyage. We found a man floating alone on a raft... Before he passed, he told us a tale to make your blood run cold. Something about a horrifying creature, ugly beyond description. I mentioned the words "one-eyed monster." Next thing I know, I'm drowning in a clay pot!

Id: [0x000E27DD]
I'll see you again when the blockade is gone.

Id: [0x000E28E2]
What <i>don't</i> I have fucking problems with? The Oracle, for one. The sea, for another. And don't get me started on my crew.

Id: [0x000E28E4]
You have business with the Oracle? You're a long way from Delphi.

Id: [0x000E28E5]
<i>Had</i> business. And my business is none of <i>your</i> fucking business. I ain't shopping for a merc'. If anything, I need the gods.

Id: [0x000E28EC]
You again?

Id: [0x000E28EF]
You need a god? I'm the next best thing.

Id: [0x000E28F0]
[&laughs]Oh, you're a live one. That's a good pitch, I'll give you that.

Id: [0x000E2957]
Shark Tooth's your boat?

Id: [0x000E2958]
Do I look like a fucking fisherman? I sail a ship, not a boat.

Id: [0x000E296E]
Oh, I thought you'd gone! Did you forget something?

Id: [0x000E2989]
I'm interrupting. Please, continue your discussion. It sounds <i>fascinating.</i>

Id: [0x000E298A]
And I've been telling Aspasia I need to appear in public to maintain the support of the citizens.

Id: [0x000E298B]
I've just come to tell your mother that the Cult's elite forces are after her, and that this place is too open.

Id: [0x000E2994]
What's this about the Cult sending soldiers?

Id: [0x000E2995]
Play along. The people here need convincing that I'm still a worthy leader. Aspasia is trying to have me hide myself away.

Id: [0x000E2998]
I'll find out what happened and bring them back.

Id: [0x000E299D]
Describe Gyke.

Id: [0x000E299E]
She's beautiful, she is. Kisses like summer. From the first time I saw her, I wanted to eat her all up...

Id: [0x000E29A2]
Do you know where they could have gone?

Id: [0x000E29A3]
The southeastern shore is pretty rich pickings. Nice cove there to trap lost, wealthy pilgrims.

Id: [0x000E2A16]
If the gods won't help you, the sickness must be destroyed by <i>our</i> hands! We have no choice.

Id: [0x000E2A18]
He won't let us go!

Id: [0x000E2A1A]
Kausos was consumed by plague... We couldn't keep up with the bodies. It was spreading - we had to intervene.

Id: [0x000E2A1B]
They killed our brothers! Our neighbors!

Id: [0x000E2A1C]
We survived the massacre, but he'll kill us now!

Id: [0x000E2A1D]
The gods have abandoned us. The sick must join the dead if we are to save the living!

Id: [0x000E2A27]
Drachmae. All stamped with the seal of Paros. And a letter? In some kind of code.

Id: [0x000E2A29]
The Cult's soldiers were paid with drachmae from Paros.

Id: [0x000E2A2A]
Well. I could hardly ask for clearer proof. This will settle some scores.

Id: [0x000E2A3F]
You burned the <i>whole</i> village?

Id: [0x000E2A41]
Many nights were lost praying. We had to take action - to scorch the blood fever out of Kausos.

Id: [0x000E2A42]
Is there no hope for a cure?

Id: [0x000E2A43]
Nothing has worked. Sacrifice, prayers...

Id: [0x000E2A44]
Healers won't come near us, soldiers won't let us leave... The gods won't answer our prayers!

Id: [0x000E2A63]
But I don't know anything about plague.

Id: [0x000E2A64]
<i>Nobody</i> gets better! This is the only way <i>all </i>of Kephallonia will save itself from extermination!

Id: [0x000E2A65]
Save us from him! Have pity!

Id: [0x000E2A66]
We aren't even that sick! We'll get better!

Id: [0x000E2A7A]
Please!

Id: [0x000E2A7B]
We have <i>children! </i>Think of <i>them!</i>

Id: [0x000E2AE8]
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be involved in this.

Id: [0x000E2AE9]
How many others will die if I free you?

Id: [0x000E2AEE]
We don't have to die!

Id: [0x000E2AEF]
You have blood on your hands!

Id: [0x000E2AF0]
You've acted on the gods' behalf. They'll bless you for this!

Id: [0x000E2AF8]
You... you didn't save them? What about Kynna? She's my friend!

Id: [0x000E2AFD]
And maybe the sickness would take the family tomorrow. It's impossible to tell.

Id: [0x000E2AFF]
I hope you're right.

Id: [0x000E2B01]
I know... I just wish it wasn't true.

Id: [0x000E2B24]
How could I make that choice? I can't always go into things spear first.

Id: [0x000E2B25]
You saw they were in trouble! What about Kynna?

Id: [0x000E2B26]
They could infect the entire island, Phoibe. You don't know best either.

Id: [0x000E2B2F]
Time to go. We're well enough to travel, but need healing.

Id: [0x000E2B31]
You're a hero!

Id: [0x000E2B32]
The real gods sent <i>you.</i>

Id: [0x000E2B33]
That priest came from the underworld. Some "man of the gods."

Id: [0x000E2B36]
It'll do just fine.

Id: [0x000E2B3A]
Forget about that. Just travel safely.

Id: [0x000E2B3D]
You're a gift from the gods, Eagle Bearer. I hope they bless you!

Id: [0x000E2B85]
Take them away!

Id: [0x000E2B86]
You're murderers! Murderers!

Id: [0x000E2E00]
Ready?

Id: [0x000E2E08]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x000E2E0E]
I have a few things to do here first.

Id: [0x000E2E0F]
We sail as soon as you've prepared.

Id: [0x000E2E22]
[&ahem]Then I leave this to you.

Id: [0x000E2E2A]
Are you ready to sail?

Id: [0x000E366F]
Well Now don't you tell me to smile

Id: [0x000E3670]
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while

Id: [0x000E3671]
Got numbers beyond what you can dial

Id: [0x000E3672]
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile

Id: [0x000E3673]
Style, profile, I said

Id: [0x000E3674]
It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child

Id: [0x000E3675]
From the Hudson River out to the Nile

Id: [0x000E3676]
I run the marathon to the very last mile

Id: [0x000E3677]
Well if you battle me I will revile

Id: [0x000E3678]
People always say my style is wild

Id: [0x000E3679]
You've got gall, you've got guile

Id: [0x000E367A]
To step to me I'm a rap oh file

Id: [0x000E367D]
If you want to battle you're in denial

Id: [0x000E367E]
Coming from Uranus to check my style

Id: [0x000E367F]
Go ahead put my rhymes on trial

Id: [0x000E3680]
Cast you off into exile

Id: [0x000E3681]
From the family tree of old school hip hop

Id: [0x000E3682]
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks

Id: [0x000E3683]
The rhymes will spread just like a pox

Id: [0x000E3684]
Cause the music is live like an electric shock

Id: [0x000E3685]
I am known to do the Wop

Id: [0x000E3686]
Also known for the Flintstone Flop

Id: [0x000E3687]
Tammy D getting biz on the crop

Id: [0x000E3688]
Beastie Boys know when to let the beat... mmm drop?

Id: [0x000E3689]
Well when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop

Id: [0x000E368A]
If my rap's soup my beats is stock

Id: [0x000E368B]
Step from the table when I start to chop

Id: [0x000E368C]
I'm a lumber jack DJ Ad rock

Id: [0x000E368D]
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked

Id: [0x000E368E]
I'll stir fry you in my wok

Id: [0x000E368F]
Your knees will start shaking and your fingers pop

Id: [0x000E3690]
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock <LF>

Id: [0x000E36D5]
I angered them I think. The gods.

Id: [0x000E3713]
It's possible. I hear they can be vengeful.

Id: [0x000E3714]
I used to worship Hermes at the Drogarati Cave. There are gods there too, y'know.

Id: [0x000E3715]
<i>In </i>the cave?

Id: [0x000E3716]
They grant wishes if you bring 'em tribute! So everyone makes an offering and asks for something in return.

Id: [0x000E3718]
No wishes of mine granted, though. And I'm running out of money <i>and </i>tribute - I'm poor myself you know! ...I did something wrong.

Id: [0x000E371B]
You know Hermes. He can be a trickster.

Id: [0x000E372F]
Oh, but there're <i>many</i> gods in this cave - all askin' for different things! Go hear 'em yourself! You'll get my last tribute if you do. I need to know if they're <i>real.</i>

Id: [0x000E3734]
I guess so. [to the sky][&breath]Have mercy on me, Zeus!

Id: [0x000E3778]
You can't!

Id: [0x000E377F]
[breath]Nikolaos! Look at me! Look at me, Nikolaos! Don't! Don't listen!

Id: [0x000E3954]
Risk Zeus's wrath, or pay drachmae out my own nose...?

Id: [0x000E395A]
We'll see about that.

Id: [0x000E395B]
Oh, thank you! Remember: be careful where you step, <i>misthios</i> - you'll be walking on holy ground!

Id: [0x000E3962]
Much has changed. I can't even stand up straight to look death in the eye.

Id: [0x000E3963]
You'll recover sooner if you let Hippokrates see you.

Id: [0x000E396A]
The Drogarati Cave is a busy spot for Kephallonians! We may be poor, but we sure are faithful.

Id: [0x000E397A]
I'll give you my last tribute if you go to the cave and find the gods out!

Id: [0x000E397C]
Bandits all along. People should've known something was off. [beat]And here's all their loot.

Id: [0x000E399A]
No gods in the caves. Only bandits stealing peoples' hopes and drachmae.

Id: [0x000E399B]
At least you know you won't face Zeus's wrath. Maybe he'll take pity on you.

Id: [0x000E399C]
I hope Zeus brings his wrath on those bandits.

Id: [0x000E399D]
Don't worry, I brought mine. That should be good enough.

Id: [0x000E399F]
I knew it! Thieves!

Id: [0x000E39A5]
By the gods! Heitor, is that you? You look... you look old, my friend.

Id: [0x000E39A6]
When was the last time I saw you? [beat]Kephallonia! That job for Markos. Remember, we ended up back to back, surrounded by angry pirates...

Id: [0x000E39A7]
They were only angry because you double-crossed them. Thank the gods we got out alive.

Id: [0x000E39A8]
[&ah]Ah![/&ah] They should've paid better.

Id: [0x000E39AA]
Some <i>malákas </i>commander came in here demanding I fix his fucking twig. When I couldn't, he said I was <i>obligated </i>to provide a new one - and the one he wanted was hanging on my wall.

Id: [0x000E39AD]
Heitor.

Id: [0x000E39AE]
Kassandra... I need my Harpe.

Id: [0x000E39AF]
I'll get Harpe back for you.

Id: [0x000E39B0]
Don't do anything stupid. I just want her back.

Id: [0x000E39B1]
Hey! You know me.

Id: [0x000E39B2]
That's why I'm afraid.

Id: [0x000E39B3]
I'd love to help an old friend, but I'm busy.

Id: [0x000E39B6]
Tell me where to find the commander.

Id: [0x000E39B7]
He's here in Attika, at Fort Phyle.

Id: [0x000E39B8]
Why go to so much trouble for an old sword?

Id: [0x000E39B9]
She's the only thing I loved that never left.

Id: [0x000E39BA]
I should be going.

Id: [0x000E39BB]
Remember, we don't want trouble. Just sneak in and take it. You're still good at that, right?

Id: [0x000E3A33]
Almighty Hermes, this is my last prayer. Listen to my plea...

Id: [0x000E3A72]
I'm poor. I have four hungry children and nothing else. I weave baskets for the market, but my cart is ruined. How can I repair it? Or sell my wares without it? Without you?

Id: [0x000E3A74]
All I can offer you is devotion, but I need your help.

Id: [0x000E3A90]
I need you to listen. Talk to me.

Id: [0x000E3A96]
Prove to me you're listening. I'll never turn away from you. Save us - please!

Id: [0x000E3A9B]
You've turned your back on me, Hermes. You tempt me to do dark things.

Id: [0x000E3A9E]
...What will I tell them?

Id: [0x000E3AA0]
Mighty Kephalos, I entreat you! Send us a champion! Someone worthy of your mighty spear! Help your priestess in her hour of need!

Id: [0x000E3AA8]
You called?

Id: [0x000E3AAB]
I'm the only one here. But maybe I can help you.

Id: [0x000E3AAD]
I need someone worthy to win the Spear of Kephalos!

Id: [0x000E3AB4]
Well. I'm sure Kephalos will send a champion if it's meant to be.

Id: [0x000E3AB6]
Well! Maybe you were sent by Kephalos!

Id: [0x000E3ABD]
Oh, thank you. I'll prepare a spot in the sanctuary!

Id: [0x000E3AD5]
Why do you need a spear? Not thinking of becoming a soldier, are you?

Id: [0x000E3AD8]
So where is the spear?

Id: [0x000E3AD9]
Apparently it's hidden deep in the caves beneath Kephallonia. There's an entrance north of here; maybe you can try that way first.

Id: [0x000E3AE0]
Kassandra! Have you come back to talk about the spear?

Id: [0x000E3AE1]
Is this the spear you're looking for?

Id: [0x000E3AE2]
That's it! Oh, praise the gods, you've found it!

Id: [0x000E3AED]
You mentioned a reward.

Id: [0x000E3AEE]
Oh. Of course! You've certainly earned it!

Id: [0x000E3AF4]
Consider it a donation to the temple.

Id: [0x000E3AF7]
What, no reward? Oh, Kassandra, I'm in your debt. If ever there's a way my temple can help you - or anyone. Send them here. I will remember.

Id: [0x000E3AFB]
I looked in the caves. The spear isn't there.

Id: [0x000E3AFC]
I had hoped to revive the sanctuary. But... it is as Kephalos wills it.

Id: [0x000E3AFF]
...I'm listening, child of Hermes.

Id: [0x000E3B01]
Your prayer is, er, heard. You will find riches at your door sooner than you... expect.

Id: [0x000E3B02]
I knew you'd listen! My every sunrise and sunset is yours. Everything beneath my humble roof in Sami is devoted to you.

Id: [0x000E3B03]
Yes. Now, go home and wait for fate to intervene.

Id: [0x000E3B04]
I will, great god, I will!

Id: [0x000E3B06]
Oh, mighty god! I beg you - help me!

Id: [0x000E3B16]
Glad you're back safely. Did you get my Harpe?

Id: [0x000E3B1A]
Yes, I found Harpe.

Id: [0x000E3B1B]
Good, good.

Id: [0x000E3B1F]
I searched every camp, but there was no sign of it.

Id: [0x000E3B20]
What happened?

Id: [0x000E3B21]
Maybe whoever stole it sold it on? It's a valuable and unique weapon.

Id: [0x000E3B22]
Huh, yes... perhaps.

Id: [0x000E3B23]
Gods be with you, Heitor.

Id: [0x000E3B28]
Heitor, you had my back and taught me so much on Kephallonia. Don't worry about the drachmae you promised - consider the favor repaid.

Id: [0x000E3B29]
You've grown into a fine woman, Kassandra. A better mercenary with both a strong arm and a kind heart would be hard to find.

Id: [0x000E3B2A]
Sometimes too kind.

Id: [0x000E3B2B]
No, of course. A <i>misthios's</i> reputation is everything.

Id: [0x000E3B2D]
Getting Harpe back wasn't easy. I had to go to a lot of trouble... A little drachmae wouldn't hurt.

Id: [0x000E3B2E]
Ha! You truly are a mercenary, through and through.

Id: [0x000E3B2F]
I learned from the best, remember?

Id: [0x000E3B30]
Of course, of course. I'm happy to pay. You did me a great service today, and great work deserves a great reward. Here, take this.

Id: [0x000E3B32]
Even if I don't swing her anymore, I'm glad to have Harpe back.

Id: [0x000E3B78]
Remind me what you need.

Id: [0x000E3B79]
I need a champion to find the Spear of Kephalos. It's hidden in the caves under the island.

Id: [0x000E3B7D]
Of course! What do you need to know?

Id: [0x000E3BEA]
If you know what's good for you and your purse, you'll take pause.

Id: [0x000E3BEC]
I'm an exile from Athens... Though by looking at me, I'm sure that's impossible to believe.

Id: [0x000E3C6F]
Your money's a siren song to bandits on Kephallonia. It won't last long.

Id: [0x000E3C70]
A successful exile, at least. Who should offer enough to keep me interested.

Id: [0x000E3C71]
You have a good eye.

Id: [0x000E3C73]
It's my brother Orneos. He's been captured by bandits! We were attacked when our ship landed. They must have smelled our wealth from across the water. I managed to escape, but he's stuck in a cage on the dock like a beast!

Id: [0x000E3C74]
My drachmae aren't going anywhere... Except a portion will be paid to <i>you</i> if you agree to my terms.

Id: [0x000E3C77]
There you are! Skulking around a temple won't save you from me, Markos.

Id: [0x000E3C78]
Drucilla! I was just talking about you.

Id: [0x000E3C79]
I need that wood, Markos. These new bows will be the talk of the island. I can't make anything with those bandit <i>malákes</i> stopping the wood shipments.

Id: [0x000E3CB0]
Of course you can’t. Why, I was just filling my friend Kassandra in on the details. She already has a plan to deal with these bandits.

Id: [0x000E3CBA]
Any idea where these bandits are?

Id: [0x000E3CBB]
I'm not a tracker, I'm a bowyer. They're in the mountains somewhere - that much I know. I'd check close to the lumber camps.

Id: [0x000E3CBD]
There's plenty of trees around. Why do you need this type of wood?

Id: [0x000E3CE8]
I don't need to know your reasons or hear your excuses.

Id: [0x000E3CE9]
This man has wronged me, Kassandra. If you'll just listen...

Id: [0x000E3CEA]
Just pay me. I don't want any part of this.

Id: [0x000E3CF1]
Despite what either of you did, this won't bring her back.

Id: [0x000E3CF2]
It will make me feel better...

Id: [0x000E3CF3]
You think killing him would make you feel better? I guarantee it won't, and it sounds like she wouldn't have wanted either of you to get hurt.

Id: [0x000E3CF6]
It sounds like neither of you was at fault.

Id: [0x000E3CF7]
He drew his weapon first.

Id: [0x000E3CF8]
It seems neither of you wanted to kill her. There are no winners here, and neither of you has to die. Let it go.

Id: [0x000E3CFB]
[&ah]You're right. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x000E3CFC]
Fuck your sorry, you destroyed my life that night. But I agree with your friend. Let's just pray we never see each other again.

Id: [0x000E3CFE]
Let him go. You made the right choice here.

Id: [0x000E3D2F]
Question?

Id: [0x000E3D30]
I've been working on a new type of bow. It's more flexible, so it lasts longer and can fire at greater range. Only a very special kind of wood that grows high in the mountains will do.

Id: [0x000E3D35]
So someone in Athens wanted you out.

Id: [0x000E3D36]
Many "someones," actually. Ostracized for the same thing, Orneos and I. "Fraud" they called it!

Id: [0x000E3D37]
What?

Id: [0x000E3D38]
A mercenary's life isn't an honest one, of course. But don't worry! Your secret's safe with me.

Id: [0x000E3D3A]
I'll take care of the bandits.

Id: [0x000E3D3B]
Make sure that you do, and be quick about it.

Id: [0x000E3D47]
Hippokrates, it's good you're here.

Id: [0x000E3D48]
Is it? Look around you. Athens is dying...

Id: [0x000E3D4B]
I need help burning the bodies, Kassandra. Fanatics are roaming the streets, trying to stop me in my work.

Id: [0x000E3DDF]
Thank you for your help.

Id: [0x000E3DF0]
I'll rescue your brother. For a price.

Id: [0x000E3DF1]
I don't have time to rescue spoiled exiles.

Id: [0x000E3DF2]
On your way then! ...But if you happen to change your mind...

Id: [0x000E3DF4]
Yes yes, of course, drachmae is the only language you Kephallonians understand.

Id: [0x000E3E1B]
Shot in the back while fleeing. Must be the work of bandits.

Id: [0x000E3E1C]
The cart was emptied, then left behind. The thief can't have gotten far with that much cargo.

Id: [0x000E3E1D]
That's a lot of footprints. A group left this area headed west.

Id: [0x000E3E24]
It's not every day you're offered what <i>I</i> pay, <i>misthios</i>. Go! Rescue my brother!

Id: [0x000E3E27]
You'll find Orneos easily at Kleptous Bay. <i>No one</i> in our family looks <i>remotely</i> like they belong here.

Id: [0x000E3E2E]
No Orneos?

Id: [0x000E3E31]
Heitor.

Id: [0x000E3E32]
Ah, my friend! I'm so glad you're here.

Id: [0x000E3E33]
I know that look... If you need a favor, just tell me.

Id: [0x000E3E34]
Well... yes. A small one. A mercenary and old friend of mine has gotten himself captured.

Id: [0x000E3E35]
OK, I'll do it.

Id: [0x000E3E36]
Thank you, my friend. Once you rescue him, take him to the beach. I've left a boat there for him to escape.

Id: [0x000E3E37]
If your friend's a mercenary like you say, he'll figure it out.

Id: [0x000E3E39]
Tell me where to look for him.

Id: [0x000E3E3A]
He's in a military camp just north of here.

Id: [0x000E3E3B]
Why are you so worried about a mercenary?

Id: [0x000E3E3C]
He's a friend. Didn't I do the same for you? Remember that trouble you and Markos got into...

Id: [0x000E3E3D]
Time to go get your friend.

Id: [0x000E3E52]
I got him out as you asked, so why kill him now? I could have dealt with him if that's what you wanted.

Id: [0x000E3E53]
Because I had to see him.

Id: [0x000E3E54]
Sometimes we cannot make up for the mistakes of our past. I'm just glad all those years with me didn't rub off on you.

Id: [0x000E3EE3]
How dare they lay their filthy hands on me! And you, here, a drachma for your efforts. Although you could have arrived sooner.

Id: [0x000E3EE4]
Your brother sent me.

Id: [0x000E3EE5]
I knew he'd rescue me! And how quickly he's found himself a lackey.

Id: [0x000E3EE6]
To be clear, I'm the one rescuing you, and if it wasn't for your brother's money I'd gladly feed you to the pigs. Now let's go. Stay close, and shut up.

Id: [0x000E3F07]
Well? Where's Orneos?

Id: [0x000E3F08]
He got lost along the way.

Id: [0x000E3F09]
A lost brother on Kephallonia? He's as good as dead! Forget your payment!

Id: [0x000E3F12]
Orneos! Reunited again!

Id: [0x000E3F15]
I don't know where you find these ruffians, brother, but they do get the job done.

Id: [0x000E3F1B]
Consider it a fee for your hubris, <i>maláka</i>.

Id: [0x000E3F1E]
Don't think I didn't notice you looting one of my chests.

Id: [0x000E3F21]
You proved yourself useful. Get yourself something nice.

Id: [0x000E3F45]
<i>Misthios</i>! Fresh vegetables for your journey - the juiciest in Kephallonia!

Id: [0x000E3F46]
I'm not really in the market for vegetables.

Id: [0x000E3F47]
No one is. Our stock is practically decomposing.

Id: [0x000E3F8D]
You stole that food from them. They were starving.

Id: [0x000E3F8E]
The supplies were essential for the war and ridding Megara of the Athenians.

Id: [0x000E3F99]
Any luck selling?

Id: [0x000E3F9A]
Does shark hunting sound any more appealing?

Id: [0x000E3F9C]
[&breath]None.

Id: [0x000E3F9D]
We'll stay here until these vegetables rot.

Id: [0x000E401A]
That shark put up a good fight. He must've liked it.

Id: [0x000E401B]
We can finally leave! No more vegetables.

Id: [0x000E401C]
I know what that's like. Good luck.

Id: [0x000E401E]
You've found it! That's the necklace!

Id: [0x000E401F]
We'll have a new life. One far from our past.

Id: [0x000E4F35]
All is lost now.

Id: [0x000E4F36]
We need to get her out of Athens.

Id: [0x000E4F38]
There you are, Kassandra. Quickly - Perikles may be inside.

Id: [0x000E4F40]
We have to leave. [beat]Don't let him die in vain.

Id: [0x000E5049]
I tried to be nice. I really did.

Id: [0x000E504C]
Everyone has a price. How much drachmae is this going to take?

Id: [0x000E504D]
Depends how much you have.

Id: [0x000E505A]
It's good to see you alive and well, Phidias!

Id: [0x000E505B]
And you, Theras. As you can see, I didn't get here alone.

Id: [0x000E50EE]
Maláka! If it isn't the Eagle Bearer herself. You got big since Kephallonia!

Id: [0x000E5139]
[&ah]Praise Athena, I knew he'd send help. I was worried they sent someone after me.

Id: [0x000E513A]
Did something happen?

Id: [0x000E513B]
[&breath]A couple of priests ransacked this treasury. They took the sapphires offered by a Thrakian king, the bastards.

Id: [0x000E513C]
No, but you'll like this. Make an example of the thieves. You find them and the sapphires, and I'll pay you much better than you're used to in Kephallonia.

Id: [0x000E5145]
Sorry about that.

Id: [0x000E5147]
You're no god.

Id: [0x000E5155]
Hmm. This one? Or that one... They're both very appealing.

Id: [0x000E5157]
With such quality, I can hardly choose wrong, can I?

Id: [0x000E5159]
Hmm, hmm. You never disappoint. I'll have no trouble finding buyers for these.

Id: [0x000E5161]
KASSANDRA...!

Id: [0x000E5162]
Ah!

Id: [0x000E517F]
He sent me to get you out of Athens.

Id: [0x000E5181]
[&laughs]Your employer won't like that.

Id: [0x000E5189]
[&breath]I'm too old for a mess like this.

Id: [0x000E518C]
You were always reliable. Deadly, and drachmae hungry, but reliable.

Id: [0x000E51DE]
Priests aren't used to thief business... They probably hid somewhere quiet. Check the caves west of here.

Id: [0x000E51F7]
I wouldn't expect priests to be jewel thieves.

Id: [0x000E51F8]
They didn't take the drachmae or the silver. They knew those sapphires were the most valuable things here. That's priest knowledge.

Id: [0x000E523C]
"They" who?

Id: [0x000E538B]
The shadows in the night... why you fear falling asleep. They're hunting me. Us. No one is safe in Athens anymore.

Id: [0x000E53D4]
Yes, yes, anything...

Id: [0x000E53D5]
You and Perikles seem close...

Id: [0x000E53D7]
I don't know who to trust. I'm just an artist... I just wanted to create. Please, what am I to do?

Id: [0x000E53D8]
First, you need to pull yourself together. You're on trial, the people are against you, and now I find that the Cult want to kill you.

Id: [0x000E5429]
Please give Perikles my thanks and my farewell. And be careful - I still believe many in Athens are in danger.

Id: [0x000E5482]
But that's life, isn't it? You're used to that, aren't you <i>misthios?</i>

Id: [0x000E55B0]
I won't leave here unarmed.

Id: [0x000E55B4]
Walking the road to Sami without armor's just asking for trouble.

Id: [0x000E571E]
Release me! I'm not an animal!

Id: [0x000E5753]
Thank the gods you found us.

Id: [0x000E58BC]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58BE]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58BF]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C0]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C1]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C2]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C3]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C4]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C5]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C6]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E58C7]
You want me to surrender? Never!

Id: [0x000E5F1D]
The Skyros! You have an eye for sturdy stock, my friend! That horse can cling to mountain passes like a goat.

Id: [0x000E5F1F]
Ah! You have picked a beauty, my friend. That horse is from Thessalonia. Bred for its courage.

Id: [0x000E5F21]
Ah, the Makedonian. These are bred for battle. A true warrior's horse!

Id: [0x000E5F24]
Which one will it be?

Id: [0x000E5F2E]
The one on the left.

Id: [0x000E5F30]
I'll take the one in the middle.

Id: [0x000E5F32]
That one - on the right.

Id: [0x000E5FCC]
Help us!

Id: [0x000E6209]
Tell me about this one.

Id: [0x000E620A]
The one in the middle. Tell me about it.

Id: [0x000E6440]
I like the look of the one on the right.

Id: [0x000E646B]
Hello, Duris. Business looks good.

Id: [0x000E646C]
Tell Markos to come down here himself if he wants his money.

Id: [0x000E6488]
Of course he will! Oh, after there's another matter I want to discuss with you. After.

Id: [0x000E6489]
But I'm here now.

Id: [0x000E648A]
Look, I was a little late paying. Now Markos says I owe him double because of interest. I don't have it to spare!

Id: [0x000E6737]
I'm just a traveler. And there's more than one broken spear in this world.

Id: [0x000E673B]
Where <i>is</i> Brasidas? I need to speak with him.

Id: [0x000E673C]
Of course you do! And the woman, you'd like to speak with her too, yes?

Id: [0x000E6754]
Follow me. Try to draw no attention to yourself.

Id: [0x000E6758]
[glottal stop] Ok. I'll be here when you get back.

Id: [0x000E675B]
Writers today, Thucydides, Euripides, the petulant Aristophanes...

Id: [0x000E675C]
All of them try for realism.

Id: [0x000E675F]
The human spirit is inspired by greatness, by magic, by gods.

Id: [0x000E6764]
I worry there's no room for dreams in this new world.

Id: [0x000E6780]
This way, over here. If anyone is watching us, they'll have my head for this.

Id: [0x000E6784]
This way, over here. If anyone is watching us, they'll have my head for this.

Id: [0x000E6785]
We must be discrete.

Id: [0x000E6789]
I can see you're a good person. What harm can there be in helping you?

Id: [0x000E6797]
Taken care of what you needed to? As I was saying...

Id: [0x000E67C4]
All right, I'll come back when I'm done.

Id: [0x000E67ED]
Brasidas didn't pay you enough? Who did? Tell me, or I'll wrap your guts around your neck and hang you from that tree!

Id: [0x000E68B7]
It was just a boy. Some archon paid him to do it.

Id: [0x000E68B9]
So that's one obstacle down. But they're a drachma a dozen here.

Id: [0x000E68F4]
Good. Any clues he has of the Cultists' identities, I want them.

Id: [0x000E68FD]
For Perikles and me, it started with our love of Athens. Our differences push us to greatness. <i>That</i> is true friendship.

Id: [0x000E6920]
Good, you made it. I was beginning to worry.

Id: [0x000E699D]
Is this a private gathering, or can anyone join?

Id: [0x000E6B26]
And you got <i>old</i>, Photios the Dog's Breath! Last time I saw you, I think I lit your ship on fire.

Id: [0x000E6B27]
[&laughs]My ship and my beard. These days, thankfully, I've semi-retired.[&scoff]

Id: [0x000E6B28]
Do people pay mercenaries here more than they did in Kephallonia?

Id: [0x000E6B29]
[&laughs]Course they do! Better than Markos, that's for sure.

Id: [0x000E7201]
I haven't forgotten the old days. I owe you one, Photios. No reward necessary.

Id: [0x000E7202]
[&laughs]Ha! I thought I was getting soft.

Id: [0x000E720F]
You said you'd do it for free, but we both know that was horse shit. Here, take this.

Id: [0x000E7212]
If I were only a little bit younger, I might've tried to cheapen the reward a bit.

Id: [0x000E7213]
Good thing you got old.

Id: [0x000E7218]
Here's a little trinket from the treasury. No one will miss it.

Id: [0x000E726E]
You don't have much time.

Id: [0x000E785F]
Duty won't save you from the ghosts of your past. Now you will answer to me.

Id: [0x000E7861]
I'm going to watch the light fade from your eyes as you die by my hand.

Id: [0x000E7863]
I loved you and your brother...

Id: [0x000E7B17]
There was also this. I assume it's their orders.

Id: [0x000E7B70]
[beat]I'd heard rumors you'd settled down in Attika. Always thought you'd die with a blade in your hand... not open up a shop.

Id: [0x000E7B71]
The blade I always thought I'd take with me is missing... I could use your help, if you're willing to assist an old friend?

Id: [0x000E7B75]
You mean Harpe? You loved that blade...

Id: [0x000E7B78]
And how will I know her when I see her?

Id: [0x000E7B79]
How could you forget a hilt of gold with a curling serpent moving up the blade?

Id: [0x000E7B7E]
So you'd like me to free him.

Id: [0x000E7B7F]
Sadly, I'm no longer able to do these things myself, otherwise I wouldn't ask.

Id: [0x000E7B80]
Kassandra, you're back. Will you help free my friend?

Id: [0x000E7CDA]
I recognize this. It's an old dialect. The Cult must use it to communicate with one another.

Id: [0x000E7CE3]
Yes, yes, you're right.

Id: [0x000E7CE4]
If we're not going to look out for each other, who will?

Id: [0x000E7D09]
Shouldn't you be in the marble quarry?

Id: [0x000E7D0B]
You talk to a pirate this way? I'll slice you!

Id: [0x000E7D0C]
Your unfinished-contract still thinks you're an artist.

Id: [0x000E7D0E]
In my past, yes, I was<i>. </i>With a point of view my overseer always wanted to change. Request after request!

Id: [0x000E7D0F]
He says you made a contract.

Id: [0x000E7D10]
That doesn't matter. I live on the sea now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

Id: [0x000E7D17]
A job's a job. I have to take you back.

Id: [0x000E7D18]
See if you can make me.

Id: [0x000E7D1A]
An artist stays an artist - it doesn't leave you. And if your point of view had to change, maybe it was to help you grow. And in the end, the art isn't for him. It's for yourself.

Id: [0x000E7D1E]
...For myself. Maybe with the drachma I could rest. Create something <i>I </i>want created. [beat I'll finish the job.

Id: [0x000E7D22]
Help me <i>grow</i>? It was a contract, malaka, it was never for me!

Id: [0x000E7D24]
You really can't complete it?

Id: [0x000E7D25]
I can't go on pleasing others and give myself nothing in return.

Id: [0x000E7D26]
I'll think of something to tell him.

Id: [0x000E7D27]
Then the chest's yours. And let me at your boat; I've learned a thing or two about carving figureheads.

Id: [0x000E7D63]
You deceived me! You asked me to rescue him just so you could kill him.

Id: [0x000E7D64]
I didn't lie... just omitted some details, that's all.

Id: [0x000E7D67]
Here, this should be more than enough. I threw in a little extra for old time's sake.

Id: [0x000E7D6C]
I can bring my ship around and clear the harbor.

Id: [0x000E7D8E]
I have only a few more things to do here.

Id: [0x000E7D8F]
As soon as you're ready, we'll set sail for Lakonia.

Id: [0x000E7D92]
I'll see you in Lakonia.

Id: [0x000E7D93]
[&breath]I'll be there.

Id: [0x000E7D95]
May Poseidon keep you safe.

Id: [0x000E7D9B]
Safe journeys.

Id: [0x000E8760]
What's your problem?

Id: [0x000E879B]
Not helpful.

Id: [0x000E879C]
OK, OK. She's raven haired and has a precious band on her arm that I gave her. Always wears it.

Id: [0x000E8861]
I'm choosing a choice I will only be able to pick once ?<LF>

Id: [0x000E886B]
Yup, it's gone forever now. R.I.P. But it activates the dictionary monologue.

Id: [0x000E8AB2]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000E8AB3]
Me? I'm no one. But you? You're even godlier than Brasidas said you'd be. It should be your statue between these trees.

Id: [0x000E8B5A]
Brasidas knows a warrior when he sees one. Word of my deeds will outlive any statue.

Id: [0x000E8B6B]
Tell me where they are, or I’ll cut that shit-eating grin off your shit-eating face!

Id: [0x000E8B6E]
He said you had a nasty temper. He wasn't wrong.

Id: [0x000E8BED]
"Just a traveler," she says. [&spit][spits blood][/&spit]

Id: [0x000E8C02]
You said Brasidas didn't pay enough. Who did?

Id: [0x000E8C03]
The Archon. He's paying more for your head than Brasidas could afford in two lifetimes.

Id: [0x000E8C07]
And the eagle he mentioned?

Id: [0x000E8C47]
Consider yourself lucky. I've seen enough blood.

Id: [0x000E8C4B]
Oh, but you'll be seeing a lot more. Welcome to Arkadia, Kassandra.

Id: [0x000E8DE2]
You'll have to find someone else.

Id: [0x000E8FB0]
Why are you looking for a champion?

Id: [0x000E8FB2]
Oh! Oh... Kassandra. You startled me.

Id: [0x000E8FCE]
If the spear is in the caves, I'll find it.

Id: [0x000E8FD1]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x000E90AA]
I've been deciphering some of the sanctuary's stone carvings. They say the spear was hidden in the caves beneath Kephallonia when the temple was built!

Id: [0x000E90AB]
Of course not. But think how many people will come to the shrine if we have the Spear of Kephalos!

Id: [0x000E90E4]
With their donations, I could do so many things! Repair the sanctuary. Feed the hungry families in Sami!

Id: [0x000E90E6]
You could get it for me, couldn't you? I can give you a reward!

Id: [0x000E90E7]
That's not much to go on.

Id: [0x000E90E8]
You have so little faith in the gods! If Kephalos means for us to have the spear, you will find it!

Id: [0x000E90F3]
I'll see what I can find.

Id: [0x000E9119]
Well. If Kephalos wills it, someone will be along, I'm sure.

Id: [0x000E9121]
I'm not interested in chasing a children's story. You'll have to find someone else.

Id: [0x000E914D]
I have some more questions.

Id: [0x000E9378]
My "feeble frame" might be harder to crush than you think.

Id: [0x000E9379]
[&laughs]So brave! Pretending you have a chance against a warrior as strong and handsome as me. We may fight for my Token, yes, but maybe you would prefer to remain un-crushed and buy my Token instead? [beat]Yes?

Id: [0x000E937F]
<i>Chaire</i>, poorly-muscled challenger! You are here to have your feeble frame crushed in my Pre-Trial of Strength, yes?

Id: [0x000E9388]
No, we fight.

Id: [0x000E938C]
There's no need for unnecessary bloodshed. I'll pay for your Token.

Id: [0x000E938D]
I'll be back.

Id: [0x000E938F]
A wise choice, my spineless friend. May you one day slither out from under from the metaphoric rock of your cowardice!

Id: [0x000E9563]
My thanks. I can't believe I let those <i>malákes </i>sneak up on me.

Id: [0x000E9564]
Ithaka is a dangerous place to wander around on your own.

Id: [0x000E9568]
I'll help you get to the palace[2425521].

Id: [0x000E9569]
Well, I'm in luck then. What do I call you?

Id: [0x000E956B]
You can get there on your own.

Id: [0x000E95DA]
Well, this is for you. Such a disappointment.

Id: [0x000E965A]
If you want Odysseus's greatness, you have to do it your own way. He was famous because of his cunning. What have you done?

Id: [0x000E965B]
I've traveled all the way here!

Id: [0x000E9661]
Odysseus didn't want to go to war. And once it was over, it took him ten years to get home. He wasted years of his life, all because the gods interfered.

Id: [0x000E9663]
But who will remember my story then?

Id: [0x000E96D1]
So you are the champion who won us the day. Tell me your name, hero, so that I may greet you as a true warrior.

Id: [0x000E97D0]
You don't look so good.

Id: [0x000E97D7]
I don't have the time. Good luck.

Id: [0x000E97DB]
All right, don't worry. I'll go.

Id: [0x000E9850]
You were never truly mine...

Id: [0x000E9851]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000E9852]
This is something you need to ask your mother.

Id: [0x000E994D]
Adelphi! You're late.

Id: [0x000E994E]
My apologies, adelphos.

Id: [0x000E994F]
The other scribes are in there already, you know, working. You got your gear?

Id: [0x000E9953]
Getting here was my problem. Equipping me is yours.

Id: [0x000E9954]
Fine. I've got writing stuff here.

Id: [0x000E9955]
Thanks.

Id: [0x000E9958]
Sorry, I wasn't expecting to be called in and...

Id: [0x000E9959]
I don't want to hear your excuses! Just grab this writing stuff and go.

Id: [0x000E995A]
Thanks.

Id: [0x000E995D]
Any advice for me, adelphos?

Id: [0x000E995E]
Walk up to people. Take notes. Make a report when you're done. Have you never done this before?

Id: [0x000E995F]
It's been a while. I'll go take notes now.

Id: [0x000E9964]
Don't just stand there, go talk to people and write shit down!

Id: [0x000E996C]
Hello adelphi. Tell me, what do you think is most important for a people: bread, or faith?

Id: [0x000E9971]
Bread. Without full stomachs, people cannot worship the gods.

Id: [0x000E9972]
One would think. But others would rather use the grain to fatten sacrificial bulls.

Id: [0x000E9974]
Faith. If people have faith, the gods will provide bread.

Id: [0x000E9975]
Many will say that. I wonder if Demeter will bake it herself.

Id: [0x000E9977]
People need both bread and faith. Bread feeds the body and faith feeds the soul.

Id: [0x000E9978]
A wise answer. As non-committal as most around here.

Id: [0x000E997B]
The Pythia told me my people would never lack bread as long as I never lacked faith in her.  So I did, and they do.

Id: [0x000E997C]
"Follow the old ways," she says. But the Pythia doesn't follow them herself, just uses them as a crutch to keep people content. As for her puppet-masters... Never mind.

Id: [0x000E997D]
Is there something you'd like me to record, adelphos?

Id: [0x000E997E]
No... Except that the old ways are maintained in Arcadia. Our shipments are on time and opposition is dealt with appropriately. My people are content. Just as the Order wishes.

Id: [0x000E9980]
Very well, adelphos. I will continue my work.

Id: [0x000E9981]
As well you should. Any change would be futile.

Id: [0x000E9986]
Apollo, may you hear my words and grant my people their place in the sun.

Id: [0x000E998E]
You there, scribe!

Id: [0x000E9990]
Yes adelphos?

Id: [0x000E9991]
It's not ad- Of course, <b>adelphi</b>.

Id: [0x000E9992]
Such a stupid custom. Shows complete disrespect.

Id: [0x000E9993]
It has its reasons, adelphos.

Id: [0x000E9994]
I'll show you reason.

Id: [0x000E9995]
Ten thousand drachmae says that a Spartan will win the pankration event at the next Olympic games.

Id: [0x000E9997]
Any Spartan?

Id: [0x000E9998]
They can all win.

Id: [0x000E9999]
Fine. Scribe, should I match my adelphos' bet and wager on an Athenian champion?

Id: [0x000E999E]
Yes, I think you should.

Id: [0x000E999F]
Admirable confidence. So you think the Delian League's ships will defeat the brutish Peloponnesians?

Id: [0x000E99A3]
Yes, the Delian League will win.

Id: [0x000E99A4]
Bah. Just wait until Spartan warriors really get to work. That blessed Parthenon will be littered with bodies.

Id: [0x000E99A6]
No, the Delian league will lose.

Id: [0x000E99A7]
But which side will history remember as the victors, I wonder?

Id: [0x000E99A9]
I... maybe?

Id: [0x000E99AA]
Heh. Not ready to handle real power, are you?

Id: [0x000E99AC]
No, I don't think so.

Id: [0x000E99AD]
Cautious, I see. So you think the Peloponnesians will skewer the Delian League at the end of their Spartan spears?

Id: [0x000E99B1]
Yes, the Spartans will win.

Id: [0x000E99B2]
Of course. The Athenians are soft and have too much to lose. Spartan courage will be remembered until the end of days.

Id: [0x000E99B4]
No, I don't think the Spartans can win.

Id: [0x000E99B5]
Single-minded warriors out of place in a progressive world. Is that what they say?

Id: [0x000E99B7]
I'm not sure.

Id: [0x000E99B8]
Not much for making decisions, are you?

Id: [0x000E99BB]
I thought we were talking about games, not politics.

Id: [0x000E99BC]
The Order has an interest in all Hellenic politics. If you can't follow that game, you should sit out the match.

Id: [0x000E99BD]
[Laughs]With an attitude like that, you should be first citizen of your precious Athens.

Id: [0x000E99BE]
All things in their time.

Id: [0x000E99C2]
Ten thousand on an Athenian pankration champion. Make a note of it.

Id: [0x000E99C4]
Yes, adelphos. [beat]If that's all, can I continue my work?

Id: [0x000E99C5]
Go on! Maybe you'll find ways for my adelphos to earn back his money.

Id: [0x000E99CA]
Record that while the matter was discussed, there will be no betting on a pankration champion at this time.

Id: [0x000E99CB]
Because you know the Spartans will win. In games or politics.

Id: [0x000E99CC]
When I win, we all win.

Id: [0x000E99CD]
Should I continue my work?

Id: [0x000E99CE]
But of course.

Id: [0x000E99D3]
Don't let me interrupt your important work.

Id: [0x000E99DB]
Scribe!

Id: [0x000E99DC]
You agree, this should be documented?

Id: [0x000E99DD]
Yes. The helmet, it's wearer... and what comes next.

Id: [0x000E99DF]
Where to begin... This Spartan headgear belonged to the Wolf, a troublesome general who assisted members of the Bloodline.

Id: [0x000E99E5]
Why is this general troublesome?

Id: [0x000E99E6]
Was. That wretched hound refused to submit to our control. But now he is no longer a concern.

Id: [0x000E99E7]
Brutal, but efficient.

Id: [0x000E99E8]
What do you mean by "bloodline"?

Id: [0x000E99E9]
The Bloodline of Heroes, of course! Descended from the gods themselves.

Id: [0x000E99EA]
Perhaps. But if not actually demigods, then at least as powerful as one would expect of such creatures.

Id: [0x000E99EC]
But that's not the best part. In ridding us of the Wolf, I found a new member of the Bloodline: His child, sired with the woman we are already pursuing.

Id: [0x000E99EE]
Excellent work adelphos. Was she under the General's protection?

Id: [0x000E99EF]
Quite the opposite. The father fell to the child's own hand.

Id: [0x000E99F1]
A patricide! May the gods have mercy on us.

Id: [0x000E99F2]
We have a higher purpose, adelphos. Eliminate the bloodline through any means necessary.

Id: [0x000E99F3]
How will you dispose of the spawn?

Id: [0x000E99F4]
That's the beauty of it. She's a mercenary, I can hire her whenever I want. [beat]Come now, adelphos, we should celebrate.

Id: [0x000E99F6]
A drink to our eventual victory?

Id: [0x000E99F8]
My apologies. I must continue my work.

Id: [0x000E99F9]
Of course. We must not keep you from your duties.

Id: [0x000E99FE]
I'll summon you when you're needed.

Id: [0x000E9A06]
Greetings adelphi! Are you at peace with the gods today?

Id: [0x000E9A0A]
Yes, I live in peace with the gods.

Id: [0x000E9A0B]
Then you're a fool. The gods don't want peace, they want war!

Id: [0x000E9A0D]
No, the gods do not leave me in peace.

Id: [0x000E9A0E]
Well good. You recognize that the gods want war.

Id: [0x000E9A10]
Their great warrior is ready! I have raised him with the guidance of Hera herself. You should mark that in your records, scribe.

Id: [0x000E9A17]
What should I write about the great warrior?

Id: [0x000E9A18]
Deimos is magnificent. Stronger than any mortal man. The ultimate form of the bloodline. He will lead our armies and destroy our enemies before they can even think to kneel.

Id: [0x000E9A19]
Impressive.

Id: [0x000E9A1A]
How did you raise this warrior?

Id: [0x000E9A1B]
I raised him in secrecy in Argolis, at the Sanctuary of Epidaurus. His training was my tribute to the goddess.

Id: [0x000E9A1C]
Praise be to Hera.

Id: [0x000E9A1E]
Deimos has already begun his work. His talents bring the will of the gods to this degenerate world.

Id: [0x000E9A20]
I am sorry, adelphi, but must continue my work.

Id: [0x000E9A22]
Do honor to the gods, adelphi.

Id: [0x000E9A27]
Hera, your sacred warrior will conquer all.

Id: [0x000E9A2F]
Are you ready to present your notes, adelphi?

Id: [0x000E9A31]
Are you ready now?

Id: [0x000E9A38]
Yes I am.

Id: [0x000E9A3A]
I'm afraid that not everyone has had the pleasure of a scribe's company. It wouldn't do to have an incomplete report.

Id: [0x000E9A3C]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x000E9A3D]
Excellent. The other scribes appear to be done as well. Time to present your findings.

Id: [0x000E9A3F]
I'm not ready yet.

Id: [0x000E9A40]
Thank you for your honesty. Please come back to me when you're done.

Id: [0x000E9A43]
Hail the Order of the Ancients. May we all be guided by understanding.

Id: [0x000E9A45]
It is time to summarize the day's business.

Id: [0x000E9A47]
My adelphi, what ways does the Order promote?

Id: [0x000E9A4C]
The Old Ways are maintained as the Order wishes. All is well in Arcadia because of this.

Id: [0x000E9A4F]
Yes, progressives and those who would threaten order are punished. Hippokrates will learn this lesson soon.

Id: [0x000E9A52]
The Order promotes new ways of thinking. More grain will come from Arcadia because of this.

Id: [0x000E9A55]
I heard that all is as it always is in Arcadia. The old ways are maintained, as they should be.

Id: [0x000E9A5A]
I heard that all is as it always is in Arcadia. The old ways are maintained, and the people prosper.

Id: [0x000E9A5C]
Now, adelphi. What of politics?

Id: [0x000E9A61]
The Order is above politics. Sports like pankration are the way to control people's hearts and minds.

Id: [0x000E9A64]
Of course the Order is concerned with all Hellenic politics. To say otherwise is foolish.

Id: [0x000E9A69]
The Order is concerned with all Hellenic politics. Also, ten thousand drachmae on an Athenian pankration champion.

Id: [0x000E9A6C]
Yes, the Order oversees all politics in Athens and beyond. Pericles will soon see his folly.

Id: [0x000E9A6F]
The Order is concerned with all Hellenic politics. Also, no bet on an Athenian pankration champion.

Id: [0x000E9A72]
Yes, the Order oversees all politics in Athens and beyond. And the Order has no confidence in Pericles.

Id: [0x000E9A77]
The Order is concerned with all Hellenic politics, as it should be. As it has always been and always will be.

Id: [0x000E9A79]
Adelphi, tell us of Deimos.

Id: [0x000E9A7E]
Deimos is the ultimate soldier. He will lead the Order's army to victory.

Id: [0x000E9A81]
Part soldier and part god. Deimos will slay our enemies and leave their lands in ruin.

Id: [0x000E9A84]
Deimos is a god on earth. He will lead an army for the Order like none have seen before.

Id: [0x000E9A87]
The strength of a god in the body of a soldier. He will lead us to victory.

Id: [0x000E9A8C]
Deimos is both god and soldier. He will lead our army and crush our enemies.

Id: [0x000E9A8E]
Finally, adelphi. What shall be done about the Bloodline of Heroes?

Id: [0x000E9A90]
The Order says the Bloodline of Heroes must be destroyed. The father is dead. A mother lives. A child will kill...

Id: [0x000E9A9F]
Deimos is come!

Id: [0x000E9AA1]
You!

Id: [0x000E9AA3]
I sent two traitors to Hades today. Time for a third.

Id: [0x000E9AA6]
It's her, the mercenary! The daughter of the Bloodline!

Id: [0x000E9AA8]
Your death will bring glory to the Order.

Id: [0x000E9AA9]
Not mine, not today.

Id: [0x000E9CB2]
You. You destroyed the Athenian blockade?

Id: [0x000E9CB3]
They were in my way.

Id: [0x000E9CB5]
Sparta owes you thanks. Tyche has blessed you, my friend. You arrived in time to watch my <i>pater</i> achieve a glorious victory.

Id: [0x000E9E32]
They took prisoners. I was too far gone to carry back to Paros.

Id: [0x000E9E3A]
If Paros has him, where would he be?

Id: [0x000E9E3B]
They joked about tying him up atop the quarry and letting the sun soften him up.

Id: [0x000E9E41]
Kassandra... Kassandra...<LF>

Id: [0x000E9E81]
In the choice hub, I am talking. Please wait.

Id: [0x000E9E82]
Are you sure I need to wait? I can't wait that long!

Id: [0x000E9E83]
That doesn't matter. I live in the dialogue hub now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

Id: [0x000E9F8D]
C<i>haire</i>, <i>pater</i>. It's been a long time.

Id: [0x000E9F8F]
Impossible. I saw you fall.

Id: [0x000E9F90]
I didn't fall, you fucking threw me to my death.

Id: [0x000E9F91]
I did what was required of me as a Spartan. I’ve made my peace with that. You need to as well.

Id: [0x000E9F92]
You were my father. You were supposed to protect me.

Id: [0x000E9F94]
You were reckless. You forced my hand.

Id: [0x000E9F95]
I was protecting my brother because <i>you</i> wouldn't.

Id: [0x000E9F98]
The Oracle decreed that Alexios had to die.

Id: [0x000E9F99]
You can't cower behind your sense of duty anymore...

Id: [0x000E9F9B]
Enough!

Id: [0x000E9F9E]
I can't change the past, Kassandra... I will live and die a Spartan.

Id: [0x000E9F9F]
There's a large reward for the mercenary that can collect the Wolf's head.

Id: [0x000E9FA0]
Is that why you're here?

Id: [0x000EA090]
You're the only survivor?

Id: [0x000EA1DD]
[&breath]Why keep him alive?

Id: [0x000EA1DE]
Leverage... They know he's important to Phoenix.

Id: [0x000EA1FC]
I was just passing and smelled opportunity on the breeze.

Id: [0x000EA1FE]
I've come to pledge my sword to the Wolf of Sparta.

Id: [0x000EA200]
If you wish to pledge your services to my <i>pater</i>, you can do so by helping me.

Id: [0x000EA202]
I'm ready to serve. Together we will ensure that Sparta is victorious.

Id: [0x000EA203]
You’re a different kind of misthios, aren’t you? You're just what we need to help deal with that meddling Athenian mercenary.

Id: [0x000EA439]
The Oracle's predictions destroyed my family.

Id: [0x000EA43A]
The Pythia has the wisdom of Apollo himself! Now I'll admit, if people choose to ignore her, they might court disaster -

Id: [0x000EA43B]
If we'd ignored the Pythia, my brother would still be alive and our mother would be safe at home.

Id: [0x000EA43D]
I'll think about it.

Id: [0x000EA43E]
Good. You know, kings and queens travel to Phokis to consult the Pythia. She can start wars or end them. They say that -

Id: [0x000EA43F]
Yes, I know. That's enough Oracle talk for now.

Id: [0x000EA441]
Back to business. You know where to meet Elpenor, I suppose?

Id: [0x000EA442]
His home is in Pilgrim's Landing. But... Nikolaos's last words to me were a warning of snakes in the grass.

Id: [0x000EA443]
Sounds like you should make extra preparations.

Id: [0x000EA444]
Elpenor is the one who should prepare.

Id: [0x000EA447]
So your plans are to claim your pay from Elpenor and go visit the Oracle?

Id: [0x000EA493]
Right! The Cyclops and I have a score of drachmae to settle. The same score as <i>you</i>, my rough-and-tumble friend.

Id: [0x000EA494]
He wouldn't be after me if it wasn't for <i>you</i>, "my friend."

Id: [0x000EA495]
[&laughs][&laughs][/&laughs]Heh, right.

Id: [0x000EA496]
It's not a war, it's a pissing match.

Id: [0x000EA499]
Think! What does the Cyclops value most? His men, his land, his ships? No. <i>His obsidian eye.</i>

Id: [0x000EA4CA]
Sometimes, good people die, Phoibe. No matter how much we don't like it.

Id: [0x000EA52D]
Having it means we win. <i>Then,</i> it goes to market. We kill two birds with one obsidian eye!

Id: [0x000EA561]
You came. Lagos still lives, then.

Id: [0x000EA56C]
I'll go see where the letter leads. You keep looking for clues.

Id: [0x000EA598]
Wha... What do you want? Who are you?

Id: [0x000EA599]
I'm the one who's going to return the tablet you stole.

Id: [0x000EA5A1]
Give it to me, I'm not leaving without it.

Id: [0x000EA5A2]
There's no winners in this war, but there are opportunities. Perhaps we could come to an arrangement?

Id: [0x000EA5A4]
Why did you steal the tablet?

Id: [0x000EA5A5]
Because I was paid to.

Id: [0x000EA5A6]
How did you get into the camp?

Id: [0x000EA5A7]
[&laughs]Spartans never suspect their own... Too busy looking down on the rest of us. Malákes!

Id: [0x000EA5AE]
Here, take the tablet... and this for your troubles.

Id: [0x000EA5AF]
Go... Make sure I never see your face again.

Id: [0x000EA5B3]
Give me the tablet, or I will cut you down.

Id: [0x000EA5B4]
I can't fight you. Here, take the tablet.

Id: [0x000EA5B7]
I'll take the tablet now.

Id: [0x000EA5B8]
Like fuck you will.

Id: [0x000EA5D6]
He'd better hold still, or he'll lose <i>both </i>eyes.

Id: [0x000EA5D7]
He keeps the eye in his house - it's too valuable to wear out. A wise choice, until you show him the error of his ways. Wait for the sun to set, sneak in, and then! <i>Bring me the eye</i>.

Id: [0x000EA81E]
I killed the messenger. He betrayed you, Brasidas.

Id: [0x000EA822]
Your messenger is lucky to be alive. He betrayed you, Brasidas.

Id: [0x000EA828]
That man is working for the Cult of Kosmos, not Sparta.

Id: [0x000EA829]
Then we need to free him from their grasp.

Id: [0x000EA82A]
What makes you think he <i>wants</i> to leave?

Id: [0x000EA82B]
Bounties and threats aren't Lagos's style. He's a farmer, not a killer.

Id: [0x000EA82C]
I <i>still</i> say we send the Archon to Hades. Upsetting Sparta's breadbasket will send the false king searching for crumbs.

Id: [0x000EA82F]
These Cultists Myrrine told me about - they knew you were coming and must have forced Lagos to place the bounty on your heads. Trusting anyone in Arkadia will be difficult now.

Id: [0x000EA830]
Which is why I say we put that Archon's head on a pike. Our message to the puppet King in Sparta will be clear.

Id: [0x000EA832]
Whatever happens, we need Lagos alive. Arkadia is Sparta's breadbasket, and Lagos keeps it full.

Id: [0x000EA83E]
<i>Cheap</i>? You wound me, Kassandra!

Id: [0x000EA842]
<i>Ai! </i>Be careful!

Id: [0x000EA843]
Do you know how many of his guards were there?

Id: [0x000EA844]
This "rock<i>" </i>could buy a <i>house, </i>my friend!

Id: [0x000EA846]
Oh, don't be upset! Think of all the <i>fun </i>we've had!

Id: [0x000EA84A]
W-wait! I saw a boat! One I've never seen before!

Id: [0x000EA84C]
So?

Id: [0x000EA84D]
The vessel's too good for this dirty town. It must be the Cyclops - and he brought friends!

Id: [0x000EA84E]
He's back? [&breath]I can never catch a break, can I?

Id: [0x000EA85C]
It can't hurt. What do I have to lose?

Id: [0x000EA85D]
<i>You? </i>You're a winner if I ever saw one.

Id: [0x000EA860]
In an abandoned house on the eastern coast. Who <i>knows </i>what golden fortunes shine in their hideout? Send them to Hades, then loot them for all they have... We'll be rich!

Id: [0x000EA861]
I'm keeping some of these "golden fortunes," though. No negotiations.

Id: [0x000EA8A3]
Don't come back until you have the tablet.

Id: [0x000EA8A4]
Lost something?

Id: [0x000EA8A5]
Not lost, stolen.

Id: [0x000EA8A7]
Stentor sent me, said you've been having trouble with spies.

Id: [0x000EA8A8]
I'd take an Athenian spy over a Spartan traitor. Either way he must be found. He took a tablet with vital intelligence.

Id: [0x000EA8A9]
Where's your spy? Is he still in the camp?

Id: [0x000EA8AA]
Wouldn't need you if I knew.

Id: [0x000EA8AB]
I'll get him <i>and</i> your tablet.

Id: [0x000EA953]
Sulfur? No wonder this place smells.

Id: [0x000EA957]
These torches were dipped in sulfur.

Id: [0x000EA95B]
[&breath]These are Athenian guard uniforms! And… they're scorched?

Id: [0x000EA95F]
To your health, Lagos!

Id: [0x000EAA93]
Only those chosen by the light of Apollo may enter.

Id: [0x000EAA9B]
Open yourself to Apollo's light, and the Oracle will deem you worthy.

Id: [0x000EAAA4]
Kassandra, isn't this remarkable? We're so close to the gods, I can feel Apollo all around me. How did it go with Elpenor?

Id: [0x000EAAA5]
We can talk later, in private. Who is this?

Id: [0x000EAAA6]
Just a simple pilgrim.

Id: [0x000EAAA8]
He just saw the Oracle. I couldn't help but ask if she's as glorious as they say.

Id: [0x000EAAA9]
Well, is she?

Id: [0x000EAAAA]
She left me with more questions than answers.

Id: [0x000EAAAB]
That's the Oracle for you!

Id: [0x000EAAAF]
I may have mentioned you.

Id: [0x000EAAEE]
You weren’t lying. It really is the spear of Leonidas.

Id: [0x000EAAF3]
One more move, and the spear will be at your throat. Tell me your name.

Id: [0x000EAAF5]
You know my spear just by looking at it? You're more than some simple pilgrim.

Id: [0x000EAAF9]
All things in Delphi are more than they appear. Even I.

Id: [0x000EAAFA]
That much is true. Why are you hiding your identity?

Id: [0x000EAAFB]
I'm here on behalf of a man in Athens. A very powerful man. We intend to finally end this war.

Id: [0x000EAAFC]
You told me you came to ask the Oracle a personal question.

Id: [0x000EAAFD]
War <i>is</i> personal, Barnabas.

Id: [0x000EAAFE]
So you came to seek the Pythia's guidance on how to end the war?

Id: [0x000EAAFF]
I did, though something is wrong in Delphi. Guards at every turn, people being turned away...

Id: [0x000EAB00]
I was turned away too.

Id: [0x000EAB0B]
You don't seem convinced the Pythia can be believed. What did she tell you?

Id: [0x000EAB0C]
I asked her to show the path to the war's end. She said, "Spring should not wish for winter, as it brings death with it."

Id: [0x000EAB0F]
Delphi is nothing like they say. Has it always been like this?

Id: [0x000EAB10]
No. This was once an open and welcoming place. But war changes things. People seek out the Pythia for more political reasons. Prophecies in times of war often stir... violent emotions.

Id: [0x000EAB11]
I have my own questions for the Pythia. But this line! I'll be an old woman by the time I see her.

Id: [0x000EAB13]
[&laughs]You're joking! You carry more blades than a field of grass!

Id: [0x000EAB14]
I didn't come here to start trouble.

Id: [0x000EAB15]
Is she not every bit as great as I said?

Id: [0x000EAB19]
Before I barge my way in to see the Pythia, I have some questions.

Id: [0x000EAB22]
Only those blessed by Apollo may enter. Go wait in line!

Id: [0x000EAB23]
Do I look like someone who waits in line?

Id: [0x000EAB47]
But - I swear - this will put an end to it! If he insists on sending his goons after us, we'll make sure his last good day was <i>yesterday</i>.

Id: [0x000EAB48]
Get to the point, Markos.

Id: [0x000EAB49]
Oh, fine. [beat] We're going to <i>steal </i>it.

Id: [0x000EAB5C]
I know a threat when I hear one.

Id: [0x000EAB6F]
Herodotos, you're still here. Where's Barnabas?

Id: [0x000EAB71]
He's gone back to your ship. [beat]You don't look happy with your prophecy.

Id: [0x000EAB8E]
Better be worth something.

Id: [0x000EAB8F]
<i>Exactly. </i>And not only is it obsidian, it's veined with gold. <i>Gold</i>! It's no wonder he saves it for special occasions.

Id: [0x000EABBE]
My name is Herodotos. I'm a story teller, or I was. This war is forcing us all to new extremes.

Id: [0x000EAC03]
Took her away? Then the whispers were true! If this Cult has corrupted the Pythia...

Id: [0x000EAC07]
I need to speak with her when she's not so well... protected.

Id: [0x000EAC0D]
Did you find the Pythia?

Id: [0x000EAC11]
You know more about the Pythia than I do. Where would she be?

Id: [0x000EAC13]
When she's not in the Temple of Apollo, she's at her home in the Chora of Delphi.

Id: [0x000EAC15]
I'll find where the Pythia lives. And I <i>will</i> get answers.

Id: [0x000EAC16]
I've heard she lives on the outskirts of the village. But be warned: she will be guarded. Not everyone comes to see the Oracle with the best of intentions.

Id: [0x000EAC1A]
Kassandra, don't forget: brute force is useless when finesse is required.

Id: [0x000EAC72]
No, <i>no</i>! It has to be done without the Cyclops <i>knowing. </i>You <i>cannot </i>be seen!

Id: [0x000EAC7E]
<i>Maláka</i>! Must be some eye to have that much protection. I have to stay out of view.

Id: [0x000EAC82]
I need cover. If I'm quiet, I can hide in the bushes.

Id: [0x000EAC86]
Now to <i>find </i>the eye. If it's as valuable as Markos says, it'll be hidden.

Id: [0x000EAC8A]
How...

Id: [0x000EAC92]
I also mentioned you can be a little defensive.

Id: [0x000EAC9B]
It's your defining trait.

Id: [0x000EAC9C]
Bring me the eye, and I'll prove you wrong. Remember! Not a <i>soul </i>can see you!

Id: [0x000EAD5C]
This will be simple for you. Sneak into the Cyclops's house, and steal me his eye!

Id: [0x000EAD60]
I want the Archon dead.

Id: [0x000EAD61]
None of this makes sense. This isn't the Lagos I know.

Id: [0x000EAD69]
So, did you kill your father?

Id: [0x000EAD6C]
It's win-win, my friend.

Id: [0x000EAD6E]
Stepfather.

Id: [0x000EAD6F]
I suppose the gods won't judge you too harshly for a "step-patricide."

Id: [0x000EAD70]
Nikolaos raised me. Trained me. He was my father, even if he did try to kill me.

Id: [0x000EAD91]
Last week? This shit happens <i>every</i> week.

Id: [0x000EAD94]
Thanks for the warning.

Id: [0x000EAD9E]
Oh! I almost forgot! Markos is looking for you.

Id: [0x000EADA0]
What does that weasel want now?

Id: [0x000EADA3]
Don't know. He wants you to meet him at his new house. On his vineyard.

Id: [0x000EADA4]
What? A <i>vineyard</i>? <i>Maláka</i>!

Id: [0x000EADB5]
What are you <i>waiting </i>for? Show those outsiders who the queen of Kephallonia is!

Id: [0x000EAE0E]
What's this? A note...

Id: [0x000EAE12]
So the tablet was meant for Hyrkanos, not the Athenians...

Id: [0x000EAEA1]
Don't get your hopes up. I've never liked sitting still. Goodbye, Phidias.

Id: [0x000EAEAE]
Brasidas? What does he have to do with this?

Id: [0x000EAEAF]
Warrior, he said! Look for the mighty warrior with the broken spear. I added the godly bit.

Id: [0x000EAEC0]
I normally have someone else do the field work.

Id: [0x000EAEC1]
There'll be more blood if you step closer.

Id: [0x000EAEC2]
Perhaps. But then you won't hear my proposition, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000EAEC4]
Not much sympathy for the men who work with you.

Id: [0x000EAEC5]
Not with me, <i>for </i>me<i>. </i>Employees. Now ex-employees, I suppose.

Id: [0x000EAEC6]
So, you don't work for the Cyclops.

Id: [0x000EAEC7]
Your kind aren't usually believers of myth.

Id: [0x000EAEC8]
Not the monster, the man. [beat]You <i>are</i> an outsider. Why are you here?

Id: [0x000EAEC9]
Indeed, I'm not from Kephallonia. I'm<i> here</i> because what I'm looking for <i>is</i>.

Id: [0x000EAECD]
Not even a drachma for the man who sent you?

Id: [0x000EAECE]
The rest goes to pay your debt. These are my terms.

Id: [0x000EAEEF]
Kassandra, it's good to have you back.

Id: [0x000EAEF1]
Those who aren't killed by the plague run wild in the streets. Death is rampant... And it's only a warning. We have ignored what truly plagues us for too long. [beat]Kleon.

Id: [0x000EAEF3]
How can you worry about him at a time like this?

Id: [0x000EAEF4]
[&ah][sigh][/&ah]Under his reign, Athens will lose the freedom and glory that has put it on the world stage.

Id: [0x000EAEF5]
How?

Id: [0x000EAF0E]
Then where are they?

Id: [0x000EAF2C]
What eagle?

Id: [0x000EAF30]
She looks like you.

Id: [0x000EAF32]
Tell me where they went.

Id: [0x000EAF33]
I should. It's what Brasidas paid me for, after all.

Id: [0x000EAF34]
Then why don't you?

Id: [0x000EAF35]
He didn't pay enough.

Id: [0x000EAF38]
A clean slaughter. <i>Very</i> good work.

Id: [0x000EAF3D]
No sign of Lagos, but he may be involved in the explosion after all. I should talk to <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x000EAFF7]
Of course! Your story should be sung from the mountain tops. In Arkadia you are already a legend.

Id: [0x000EAFFE]
You threatened the wrong people, <i>maláka</i>.

Id: [0x000EB009]
Do you know how much obsidian goes for on Kephallonia?

Id: [0x000EB00A]
I've never seen it.

Id: [0x000EB0CE]
I thought that was you.

Id: [0x000EB0D1]
[&laughs]You flatter me.

Id: [0x000EB0E3]
I doubt he's still here. Can't have gone far though, he was injured when he took out the guard.

Id: [0x000EB0E9]
By Apollo, was everyone asleep? Come on,<LF>find the bastard!

Id: [0x000EB132]
[&ah]What is that stench?

Id: [0x000EB171]
What do you have in mind, Brasidas?

Id: [0x000EB1BB]
What arrangement would that be?

Id: [0x000EB1BD]
No one knows who I am. Nobody else needs to die here.

Id: [0x000EB1C0]
Who paid you?

Id: [0x000EB1C1]
A mercenary. Hyrkanos, all right? Gave me the Spartan uniform, told me where to look. Easy drachmae.

Id: [0x000EB1C2]
Then only one of us will be getting paid today.

Id: [0x000EB1CB]
Let's hear it then. What do I have to do?

Id: [0x000EB1CC]
What will <i>we </i>do, you mean! As the brains to your brawn, I consider it a joint effort.

Id: [0x000EB1CD]
Of course you do.

Id: [0x000EB1D0]
You know <i>just </i>how to hurt me, Kassandra.

Id: [0x000EB1D1]
It's not that hard, trust me.

Id: [0x000EB1D5]
Fine.

Id: [0x000EB1D6]
Better your pocket than his socket!

Id: [0x000EB1D7]
I think that's enough for one day. <i>Chaire</i>, Markos.

Id: [0x000EB1E8]
Right. Your fun, my blood. You can't keep dragging me into things, Markos.

Id: [0x000EB1EA]
The Cyclops is going to kill us, Markos. It's as simple as that. And there's nothing fun about it.

Id: [0x000EB1EC]
This will work, I promise you! Would I lie to you?

Id: [0x000EB1FF]
It comes with the territory.

Id: [0x000EB200]
Then you're just the <i>misthios</i> I'm looking for.

Id: [0x000EB217]
Boss – I keep telling you – you can’t do that.

Id: [0x000EB218]
Why? It’s my farm! I can plant where I want.

Id: [0x000EB219]
The grapes will die here - all of them.

Id: [0x000EB21A]
You have to forget what you know about the past, my friend – together, we will revolutionize wine making! Believe me, you will look back on this day and -

Id: [0x000EB21C]
Kassandra, thank the gods - Phoibe found you in time.

Id: [0x000EB21E]
I can still hear you...

Id: [0x000EB21F]
I was worried sick. The Cyclops sent his scum to find you. I think they mean you harm.

Id: [0x000EB225]
Please, Markos. You’ll fuck this up like you fuck up everything else. You can’t pay me back in <i>grapes</i>.

Id: [0x000EB2CD]
What do you think we should do?

Id: [0x000EB3A3]
Because you don’t know how to grow grapes or make wine?

Id: [0x000EB3C1]
Do I have the money I owe you? Of course. Of course. [beat]Well, no. Not at the moment.

Id: [0x000EB3C2]
Then - get - it.

Id: [0x000EB3C3]
Instantly, my friend, instantly. But – maybe you should do that. There is a merchant in Sami – I’m not very good at these things as you know.

Id: [0x000EB3C4]
You want me to collect my own debt?

Id: [0x000EB3C5]
It's just waiting for you in Sami, my friend.

Id: [0x000EB460]
I think you and Kleon both made good points.

Id: [0x000EB462]
"Good points" aren't at all what the crowd seemed to care about. They're afraid, and Kleon indulged their fear.

Id: [0x000EB463]
I think you did a great job.

Id: [0x000EB465]
It's so easy to forget the good someone has done when times become hard.

Id: [0x000EB488]
Perikles, we've come to -

Id: [0x000EB489]
As does everybody.

Id: [0x000EB48A]
If she's working for you, maybe the prying eyes will see her as a servant.

Id: [0x000EB48B]
I'm no one's "servant."

Id: [0x000EB48C]
Kassandra, this is Athens. If you want something, sometimes you have to play a role.

Id: [0x000EB48D]
And what exactly is it that you want?

Id: [0x000EB4E1]
I would appreciate you showing a bit more... secrecy.

Id: [0x000EB4E2]
Well, it's just he seemed interested in legends - like you. I thought you might get along.

Id: [0x000EB4E3]
<i>Maláka</i>! Barnabas, use your head!

Id: [0x000EB4F6]
Go with Apollo, child. The Oracle is done for the day.

Id: [0x000EB507]
You're alive!

Id: [0x000EB516]
There were people in the temple. I couldn't see their faces. They... Herodotos, they control all of the Greek world. Everything.

Id: [0x000EB518]
I found them. They have an army. Not the Spartans or Delians - an army just to themselves. I can't fight an army, Herodotos.

Id: [0x000EB51A]
They know me. My family. They want my mother dead.

Id: [0x000EB54B]
This doesn't sound like something a Spartan would do?

Id: [0x000EB54C]
And what man would turn their back on Sparta?

Id: [0x000EB54D]
He <i>could</i> be an imposter, we've had raids on our supplies recently... And Megaris has more mercenaries than a goat has ticks.

Id: [0x000EB555]
Misthios! If this man is a Spartan... take your time killing him.

Id: [0x000EB556]
Whoever he is, I will make him pay for betraying Sparta.

Id: [0x000EB567]
What happened here?

Id: [0x000EB569]
What business is it of yours, <i>misthios</i>? Do you know anything about this?

Id: [0x000EB58E]
But it's your lucky day, I'm here to help. Stentor sent me.

Id: [0x000EB58F]
If I did, you'd already be dead.

Id: [0x000EB67D]
You remind me of Nikolaos. You fight just like him; ruthless and cunning. He would be proud.

Id: [0x000EB67E]
The real world taught me better. When someone wants your head, you have to learn to save your neck.

Id: [0x000EB67F]
I know exactly what you mean.

Id: [0x000EB683]
Timo knows Paros is a threat. They make their business clear.

Id: [0x000EB685]
Maybe there was, but it's <i>long</i> over. Now there's no mistaking them for anything but the enemy.

Id: [0x000EB686]
An enemy I could help you defeat.

Id: [0x000EB687]
We'll discuss that later. [beat]But I think you're right.

Id: [0x000EB68B]
[&breath]The island is beautiful.

Id: [0x000EB68C]
It is. Sparta has nothing on Naxian beaches.

Id: [0x000EB68E]
[&ahem]Sparta. All I remember is the bottom of Mount Taygetos.

Id: [0x000EB690]
When I brought you to the Pythia as a baby, she never said we would live a nightmare. She said you had such <i>promise.</i>

Id: [0x000EB694]
I’m a professional and a friend.

Id: [0x000EB695]
If it had been me, I'd have been smart enough to try and hide the evidence.

Id: [0x000EB697]
What's that supposed to mean?

Id: [0x000EB7BB]
Athens? We need to find my mother.

Id: [0x000EB7BD]
Of course.

Id: [0x000EB7BE]
My spear!

Id: [0x000EB7C8]
The Pythia can't predict everything.

Id: [0x000EB7CE]
The temple's coming along, Evandros.

Id: [0x000EB7CF]
It'll stay in ruins if we don't secure more donations. Soldiers can't get <i>all </i>the funds.

Id: [0x000EB7D0]
They can if you don't want the temple destroyed by our enemy. [beat]But I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x000EB7D1]
It's a good deed, restarting construction. Lygdamis was a great man who deserves reverence.

Id: [0x000EB7D6]
There's more. They have a weapon.

Id: [0x000EB7E1]
Nothing to say? Others would do well to realize silence is as much of an answer as anything else. A crowd will seize the first easy answer that comes its way, like a hungry dog on a bone.

Id: [0x000EB7E4]
Exile is a term you may be more familiar with. Here in Athens, we vote between two people to decide who should leave.

Id: [0x000EB7E5]
What... kind?

Id: [0x000EB7E6]
A soldier. Stronger and more ferocious than any I've ever seen. [beat]Herodotos, it's my brother.

Id: [0x000EB7E8]
I see. It's worse than I thought.

Id: [0x000EB7EF]
"My story will outlive any statue."[&spit][spits blood][/&spit]

Id: [0x000EB802]
Oh, and do give more thought to letting me sculpt you, should you visit me in Elis!

Id: [0x000EB80B]
"Blood or change - Phoenix must choose."

Id: [0x000EB80C]
This "artist's" work is everywhere. Their dislike is as clear as water.

Id: [0x000EB80F]
Your general acted quickly - raising the alarm.

Id: [0x000EB872]
No - I found you.

Id: [0x000EB87D]
My clothes. Spear.

Id: [0x000EB891]
Who says that?

Id: [0x000EB897]
To Athens?! They're hunting my family. My mother. I have to find her.

Id: [0x000EB898]
You carry the blade of Leonidas. Act like it! If Perikles doesn't put an end to this war, we're all as good as dead - including your mother.

Id: [0x000EB89A]
The Cult of Kosmos call my brother Deimos. He used an artifact to see my memories.

Id: [0x000EB8A1]
Kassandra, the man I serve. We must tell him what's happened before it's too late. [beat]You've heard the name Perikles before?

Id: [0x000EB8AB]
You weren't there, Herodotos. The Cult controls everything. There's no stopping them.

Id: [0x000EB8AC]
Which is why you cannot turn away. They want to destroy all of the Greek world with this war.

Id: [0x000EB8AD]
Fuck your war! The Cultists are exterminating my family!

Id: [0x000EB8AE]
You have a duty to the Greek world. We both do. Perikles must be warned.

Id: [0x000EB8AF]
She is my <i>mother</i>. What would you have me do?

Id: [0x000EB8B0]
If there is one place where we can find information about your mother, it is in Athens.

Id: [0x000EB8B1]
How?

Id: [0x000EB8B2]
Perikles surrounds himself with the brightest minds in Athens, which is to say anywhere. In Athens you can fulfill your duty to your family.

Id: [0x000EB8B5]
I won't be some pawn in your scheme, Herodotos.

Id: [0x000EB8B6]
Don't do it for me, then. Do it for your mother.

Id: [0x000EB8B7]
Thank you, Phoenix.

Id: [0x000EB8BF]
Answer with a weapon. Then there'll be no back-talk.

Id: [0x000EB8C2]
Stentor sent you?

Id: [0x000EB8C3]
Sparta doesn't fully control Megaris... yet. It's easier for me to move freely in certain areas of Megaris than a Spartan.

Id: [0x000EB8D6]
I found him, and he paid in blood for his deeds.

Id: [0x000EB8D7]
As long as he paid. Did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x000EB8DF]
It's not traitors you need to worry about. He was a spy working for the mercenary Hyrkanos.

Id: [0x000EB8E0]
Hyrkanos. How many times must I hear that name? His palms must be overflowing with Athenian gold by now. Did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x000EBA33]
I'll help you rid Megaris of Athenians for a price.

Id: [0x000EBA34]
Typical of your type. No honor or sense of duty, but your skills are better serving us than our enemy. The Athenians already have a mercenary working for them, they don't need more help.

Id: [0x000EBA39]
You have to think before you act. This is politics... however tempting it is to act on instinct.

Id: [0x000EBA3C]
The work of a coward. If they meant it, you'd have a sword to your throat right now.

Id: [0x000EBA3D]
You saw that crowd - words are powerful. They're probably gossiping and plotting as we speak.

Id: [0x000EBA44]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x000EBA50]
This rebel obviously wants attention. Someone should give it to them.

Id: [0x000EBA51]
I had a similar thought. And I think that someone could be you.

Id: [0x000EBA54]
There are people in Phokis who can't be trusted, Kassandra. But I'm not one of them. If you know something, you must act quickly. The Pythia's words control all our fates.

Id: [0x000EBA73]
Perikles is the great general leading the Delian League against the Spartans. They say he's ruthless.

Id: [0x000EBA76]
Save your doubts. He is working to end this war. We all are. If there are forces colluding against him, he must be warned. We have to go.

Id: [0x000EBA7F]
We aren't leading the League against anyone! Perikles is a man of peace. This war was thrust upon him... upon us all.

Id: [0x000EBA80]
Perikles is the king of the free people of Athens.

Id: [0x000EBA81]
King?! Athens has no king. Perikles serves the people, not the other way around.

Id: [0x000EBA82]
Serves the people? You're right. He's not much of a king.

Id: [0x000EBA83]
A general who doesn't want war? Not likely.

Id: [0x000EBA89]
All of this talk of the Pythia. The Pythia! I do not care what she says.

Id: [0x000EBA98]
[thoughtful sigh]But before we can go... I need you to meet me at the Lion of Leonidas, at Thermopylai.

Id: [0x000EBABA]
What are you going to do with them?

Id: [0x000EBABB]
Dump them in a well. [beat]Ah, it looks like the official has arrived.

Id: [0x000EBAC2]
I'm glad I could get him out alive.

Id: [0x000EBAC3]
And for that heroism, I've found some information on a man named Brison who's plotting Phidias's early demise. Hopefully, you can make something of this clue.

Id: [0x000EBAC5]
If I wasn't getting something out of it, he'd be dead already.

Id: [0x000EBACE]
I apologize for the delay. There was evidence someone attempted to tamper with the votes.

Id: [0x000EBAD2]
Don't worry. The ostraca are all accounted for. The votes were counted, and Anaxagoras is to be ostracized.

Id: [0x000EBB0A]
His battles against corruption and oligarchy are lessons we all should remember. I do intend to finish the temple.

Id: [0x000EBB5B]
The Athenians have proven more resilient here than expected, but they will not stand...

Id: [0x000EBB5D]
...Before Sparta, yes - I've heard the speeches. But until that glorious day comes, we should find out what happened here.

Id: [0x000EBB5E]
Do you have any ideas?

Id: [0x000EBB5F]
Not yet, but I will.

Id: [0x000EBB75]
So, what happened?

Id: [0x000EBB77]
These were professional soldiers, slaughtered to a man. I don't think bandits could have done this...

Id: [0x000EBB7A]
My baby! No!

Id: [0x000EBB7B]
[crying]Sto--[crying]

Id: [0x000EBB84]
The supplies are missing. They can't have gone far though... they didn't use the carts.

Id: [0x000EBB89]
Looks like they went this way into the forest.

Id: [0x000EBB95]
[cry]No! Don't listen! Nikolaos! [cry]Why?

Id: [0x000EBB96]
Nikolaos! Stop! Nikolaos! No! Nikolaos![cry]

Id: [0x000EBBA3]
<i>Pater</i>?

Id: [0x000EBBA4]
No, oh my baby...

Id: [0x000EBD77]
Take this and present it to my scouts. If you find them in the field be sure to check for new information. They might also have need of your skills.

Id: [0x000EBD86]
I have... a lot of questions.

Id: [0x000EBD87]
I think we both do. [beat]But ask. I'll answer what I can.

Id: [0x000EBDC6]
I knew you'd come find me sooner or later.

Id: [0x000EBDC7]
What tipped you off?

Id: [0x000EBDCE]
It's the least I could do.

Id: [0x000EBDCF]
You killed my soldiers. But -

Id: [0x000EBDD7]
Your actions are hard to ignore.

Id: [0x000EBDD8]
My mother and I take the <i>Cult's</i> actions against us seriously. Now lift the bounty.

Id: [0x000EBDD9]
After murdering my men and destroying my property?

Id: [0x000EBDDC]
I did what I had to - even with everyone in Arkadia trying to kill me.

Id: [0x000EBDEB]
There's nothing to discuss. You're a Cultist, and that's all I need to know.

Id: [0x000EBDEC]
I had no choice. Please!

Id: [0x000EBDF1]
It's not too late. Leave the Cult of Kosmos and join Brasidas.

Id: [0x000EBE25]
You don't need to worry about him anymore. It was a tough fight, but I took him down. He paid in blood!

Id: [0x000EBE26]
Here's your precious tablet. You should be more careful in future.

Id: [0x000EBE4E]
I need to keep looking, there's still some pieces missing.

Id: [0x000EBE56]
So was it the Athenians?

Id: [0x000EBE5F]
If it was Athenians, they would have taken the carts as well as the supplies... And bandits, they wouldn't have stood a chance against trained Spartans.

Id: [0x000EBE63]
Nothing about this adds up...

Id: [0x000EBE64]
In what way?

Id: [0x000EBE65]
There's no bodies, at least not any assailants.

Id: [0x000EBE6B]
I'm not sure...

Id: [0x000EBE95]
What are you saying?

Id: [0x000EBE99]
Athenians would have taken the carts and their dead, but bandits would have left their fallen in the dust.

Id: [0x000EBE9A]
Then who did it?

Id: [0x000EBE9D]
Whoever did this went into the forest... So I'll start by looking there.

Id: [0x000EBEC2]
Have you found the culprits?

Id: [0x000EBECF]
Not yet.

Id: [0x000EBEDC]
Then that's my next stop.

Id: [0x000EBEDD]
Have you thought about what you'll say to her?

Id: [0x000EBEE2]
You'll find Phoenix in the villa at the center of town. All the city's business is conducted there.

Id: [0x000EBEE3]
We've had quite the adventure.

Id: [0x000EBEE4]
I have some business to attend to before moving on, and I have friends in the city I need to see.

Id: [0x000EBF05]
We need to get to Athens.

Id: [0x000EBF18]
They can't be more clear than sending soldiers. [beat]There's no treaty?

Id: [0x000EBF4E]
Is that better or worse? No matter. Yours isn't the only complicated family in the world.

Id: [0x000EBF56]
What? Wait! No, please you don't understand!

Id: [0x000EBF5E]
Soldiers from Paros just made landfall in the cove. A small force, maybe a dozen.

Id: [0x000EBF61]
<i>Maláka</i>! Timo, gather the troops.

Id: [0x000EBF62]
Better than when you last saw me.

Id: [0x000EBF63]
Good. Come.

Id: [0x000EBF65]
So, I followed a trail that started with slaughtered Spartans and stolen goods and ends with you... And the supplies... All hiding quietly in a cave.

Id: [0x000EBF68]
We just took the food. We didn't hurt anyone.

Id: [0x000EBF6B]
Like the mercy you showed those Spartan soldiers?

Id: [0x000EBF6C]
I, we... We just took some food. Hyrkanos told us to take it, said he'd make it easy for us.

Id: [0x000EBF6D]
So you repay theft with murder? A fine lesson for your children.

Id: [0x000EBF6F]
Murder, no. Please, we never harmed anyone.

Id: [0x000EBF73]
Hyrkanos?

Id: [0x000EBF74]
Yes, the mercenary. He said he'd provide food, told us the Athenians would never let their people go hungry.

Id: [0x000EBF8C]
You are murderers and thieves, and deserve no better.

Id: [0x000EBF8D]
Please, no! You don't understand, it was a mercenary that killed the soldiers!

Id: [0x000EBFB4]
What's to understand? It all seems perfectly clear.

Id: [0x000EBFB5]
There is only one just punishment for your crime.

Id: [0x000EBFBC]
Please, no!

Id: [0x000EBFCC]
We were just hungry...

Id: [0x000EBFD9]
Wait...

Id: [0x000EC0BE]
Then it is good news. Soon Megara will be secured, and we will push on to Athens.

Id: [0x000EC0C1]
Hungry Megarians are the least of your worries, but there's something else. Have you heard of a mercenary called Hyrkanos?

Id: [0x000EC0C2]
Hyrkanos... Yes, he is working for the Athenians, so the rumors go.

Id: [0x000EC0C3]
This is all his doing.

Id: [0x000EC0C5]
They didn't do this alone, there's more going on than we can see...

Id: [0x000EC0C6]
Don't worry yourself further. The guilty have paid for their crime, and that is what is important. You have done well. Sparta thanks you.

Id: [0x000EC0CA]
I found your supplies with a bunch of hungry Megarians.

Id: [0x000EC0CB]
And?

Id: [0x000EC0D2]
These mercenaries are persistent, I'll give them that. You've done well here, but if you really want to help Sparta, I have a task for you.

Id: [0x000EC0DD]
Hurry! Take what you can carry and go.

Id: [0x000EC0E0]
Quick.

Id: [0x000EC0E9]
...And double the patrols. If Paros is sending them, I want to know the moment they make landfall.

Id: [0x000EC0EA]
Yes, Archon.

Id: [0x000EC0ED]
But Archon, please. The merchants -

Id: [0x000EC0EE]
Chersis - I understand your concerns. But protecting the town and the quarries is what's most important.

Id: [0x000EC0F0]
You may all go.

Id: [0x000EC0F3]
The meeting is over.

Id: [0x000EC0F6]
...Kassandra? How?

Id: [0x000EC0F9]
They have him, don't they?

Id: [0x000EC107]
The Cult must be stopped. I did what I had to.

Id: [0x000EC10C]
The world is so chaotic now.

Id: [0x000EC10D]
The Cult made it that way.

Id: [0x000EC110]
I am. He said there is an ostracism vote, but didn't tell me what I'm here to do.

Id: [0x000EC115]
What's my role in this?

Id: [0x000EC117]
The votes have already been cast. We don't have long before they're counted. Take the ostraka in this bag and exchange them with the ones currently under guard.

Id: [0x000EC118]
No one will see me go in or out. Stay here.

Id: [0x000EC11A]
You want me to rig the ostracism?

Id: [0x000EC11B]
Perikles does, and he has his reasons I'm sure. Bring me the bag you took from the room, and I'll take care of the rest.

Id: [0x000EC1BA]
We're living in divided times. Sparta against Athens. Old against new.

Id: [0x000EC1BB]
[ONO, breath] When I close my eyes, I can still see you falling. I thought I had lost you.

Id: [0x000EC1BD]
It's really you. It's not some trick of the gods.[ONO, laugh]

Id: [0x000EC1CC]
I've never forgotten what you both taught me. I had a good education.

Id: [0x000EC1CD]
I wanted you to be unstoppable. And you are.

Id: [0x000EC1E3]
Your brother - we have to get him back.

Id: [0x000EC1F4]
I rebuilt my life from ashes, do you understand? And now you tell me... you're alive. You're both alive.

Id: [0x000EC1FA]
Upwards and godwards, as the pilgrims say.

Id: [0x000EC207]
But... my family is being held hostage, and the Cult will kill them if I remove the bounty on your head.

Id: [0x000EC212]
The Wolf is dead.

Id: [0x000EC214]
Excellent. The full amount, as promised.

Id: [0x000EC216]
You expected me to haggle? Come now, Kassandra. It isn't every day I have someone kill their own father.

Id: [0x000EC217]
But he wasn't your real father, was he?

Id: [0x000EC219]
I found your family. Brasidas is rescuing them as we speak.

Id: [0x000EC21A]
That is... unexpected. Thank you.

Id: [0x000EC21C]
It's about time we took the fight to the Athenians.

Id: [0x000EC21D]
Yes, it's time they felt the wrath of Sparta! Come, kleos[[glory]] awaits.

Id: [0x000EC21E]
It's what I was born to do...

Id: [0x000EC223]
I seen 'em, Ned, I seen the angel of death, he's got snake eyes.

Id: [0x000EC224]
Who Will, who's got snake eyes?

Id: [0x000EC225]
It's the angel of death, oh Ned, I'm scared of dyin'

Id: [0x000EC226]
Easy, partner, easy.

Id: [0x000EC227]
I see Claudia too.

Id: [0x000EC228]
That's good, Will, that's good you saw Claudia, ain't it?

Id: [0x000EC229]
Her face was all covered with worms, oh Ned I'm scared, I'm dyin'. Don't tell nobody, don't tell my kids, none of the things I done, hear me?

Id: [0x000EC22A]
All right, Will.

Id: [0x000EC236]
Why did you send me to kill Nikolaos?

Id: [0x000EC237]
Because I knew you could. Oh, why him? Because he was brilliant. He would have taken Athens in a month, two at most. And Stentor doesn't have the Wolf's genius.

Id: [0x000EC23A]
I assume you can use those weapons?

Id: [0x000EC23C]
You wanted to save Athens?

Id: [0x000EC23D]
There's no profit in a quick war.

Id: [0x000EC23E]
How did you know Nikolaos was my stepfather?

Id: [0x000EC23F]
I love theater. All of the arts, really. A great general throws his own children off a cliff on the say-so of the Oracle... It is a tragedy for the ages.

Id: [0x000EC240]
You think my life is entertainment?

Id: [0x000EC241]
Oh no, my friend. It is art.

Id: [0x000EC242]
I don't believe you! The Cult has no respect for family. You're lying to save your own skin.

Id: [0x000EC243]
I'm telling the truth.

Id: [0x000EC244]
[&scream]Enough![/&scream]

Id: [0x000EC24C]
If what you're saying is true, then leave your office of archon and join Brasidas and I in our fight against the Cult.

Id: [0x000EC24D]
I can't do that. If I lift a hand against the Cult, they'll kill my family.

Id: [0x000EC24E]
Is there nothing I can do?

Id: [0x000EC24F]
Yes. Tell Brasidas I died like a Spartan.

Id: [0x000EC255]
Tell me <i>misthios</i>, did you learn anything worthwhile in your dealings with the Wolf?

Id: [0x000EC25D]
Paros, across the bay. It seems Silanos has finally grown tired of sharing the marble trade.

Id: [0x000EC25F]
We've always had problems with Paros. I expected an attack, just not so soon.

Id: [0x000EC261]
[&scoff]Allies often forget their allegiances when opportunity beckons...

Id: [0x000EC268]
You were?

Id: [0x000EC275]
Kassandra! Over here!

Id: [0x000EC2A1]
My name is Lt. Aldo Raine and I'm puttin' together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers. Eight Jewish-American soldiers. Now, y'all might've heard rumors about the armada happenin' soon. Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier. We're gonna be dropped into France, dressed as civilians. And once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhackin' guerrilla army, we're gonna be doin' one thing and one thing only - killin' Nazis. Now, I don't know about y'all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the god-damn Smoky Mountains, cross five thousand miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a f--kin' air-o-plane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity. Nazi ain't got no humanity. They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hatin', mass murderin' maniac and they need to be dee-stroyed. That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearin' a Nazi uniform, they're gonna die.<LF><LF>Now, I'm the direct descendant of the mountain man Jim Bridger. That means I got a little Injun in me. And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance. We will be cruel to the Germans, and through our cruelty they will know who we are. And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered, and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us. And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels, and the edge of our knives. And the German will be sickened by us, and the German will talk about us, and the German will fear us. And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with. Sound good?

Id: [0x000EC50A]
Considering how many showed up here, yes! What did I say about being seen? [beat]At least you taught them a lesson.

Id: [0x000EC50B]
All for a fucking <i>rock</i>...

Id: [0x000EC513]
The Wolf takes no prisoners!

Id: [0x000EC522]
See how the Athenian dog Perikles fears you! He cowers in his Parthenon, surrounded by playwrights and sophists. He dares not face you with honor on the battlefield. He knows you are too strong. He knows Athens's days in Megaris are numbered. And he knows Athens is next!

Id: [0x000EC543]
I better take some lumber back as proof. That old bag won't just take my word for it.

Id: [0x000EC547]
Oh look, it's Markos's mighty champion. Don’t tell me you actually did what I asked?

Id: [0x000EC548]
I brought you some wood back to work with until the rest arrives.

Id: [0x000EC54A]
By the gods! You sure you work with Markos?  He's never once delivered on a promise. Incredible!

Id: [0x000EC54B]
I might work with him, but we're nothing alike. I'm true to my word.

Id: [0x000EC54C]
Then take your pay. Give none to Markos.

Id: [0x000EC551]
I tracked the bandits and sent them to Hades. Your wood should arrive in town soon.

Id: [0x000EC552]
And you expect me to believe the word of a mercenary?

Id: [0x000EC575]
Who's the merchant?

Id: [0x000EC578]
Duris. You know Duris. He's very nice.

Id: [0x000EC57A]
Where can I find Duris?

Id: [0x000EC57B]
In a shop in Sami overlooking the docks – you know this Kassandra.

Id: [0x000EC57C]
Will he be there?

Id: [0x000EC57D]
You mistake me for the Pythia. I couldn't possibly know.

Id: [0x000EC580]
Duris? Again? Why do you keep lending him money?

Id: [0x000EC581]
He’s a loyal friend. I don’t want his family to starve.

Id: [0x000EC582]
You're a good friend, but you're bad with money.

Id: [0x000EC584]
<i>Duris?</i> How stupid can you get? Stop giving him money!

Id: [0x000EC587]
He always pays me back.

Id: [0x000EC588]
After I threaten him.

Id: [0x000EC589]
Exactly – everybody benefits. Duris gets his money. I get my interest – and you have work.  Kephallonia is wonderful, is it not?

Id: [0x000EC591]
A, uh, a fine choice. But, this particular breed has a few... quirks that you might not be aware of. I wouldn't want you to take an unworthy horse.

Id: [0x000EC592]
Everybody benefits. Especially <i>you! </i>You've chosen the great Phobos. He's never let me down!

Id: [0x000EC595]
I've seen too many people die already. Please, come away from here.

Id: [0x000EC596]
I understand you perfectly. But I also need to be <i>seen</i>. The propagandist did his job well. I need more support to attack Paros.

Id: [0x000EC5C5]
What are you doing? Stop that!

Id: [0x000EC5C7]
Stop breaking things!

Id: [0x000EC5C9]
I – I - I'll put a bounty on your head!

Id: [0x000EC5CA]
<i>Maláka</i>! You bring the Cyclops into this and then you and I will have a serious problem. Understand?

Id: [0x000EC5E8]
It is what she wants. Phoenix wants to fight for the people - not against them. Just stop them making anymore art.

Id: [0x000EC5E9]
Is the rest of this "art" as subtle?

Id: [0x000EC5EA]
More of the same - death threats. The dust in Naxos must settle, or Phoenix will be killed and replaced as archon.

Id: [0x000EC622]
How’d it go with Markos?

Id: [0x000EC623]
How it always goes. I didn’t get my money, and I’m running another errand for him.

Id: [0x000EC624]
Why do you let him boss you around?

Id: [0x000EC627]
He doesn't. He just gets me into situations I have to dig myself out of.

Id: [0x000EC62C]
Not that kind of debt. Few people would take in a runaway they caught thieving. I was just a kid.

Id: [0x000EC62D]
Huh.

Id: [0x000EC63B]
I'll stop them.

Id: [0x000EC652]
This came from whatever wrote this message. I'll take it to the art merchant.

Id: [0x000EC662]
Kassandra! Read the room, my dear…

Id: [0x000EC66A]
We cannot answer their threats with violence of our own. That'll add more fuel to the fire.

Id: [0x000EC66B]
If that's what you want.

Id: [0x000EC66C]
I know artists are sensitive, but something really made this one mad.

Id: [0x000EC673]
This spy needs to be found. The information he stole is crucial to the war effort.

Id: [0x000EC675]
If you consider this "art".

Id: [0x000EC678]
The city thinks war is coming - and they're not wrong. But they're certain that Phoenix is the one driving us toward disaster.

Id: [0x000EC68F]
Hmm... Abandoned farmhouse, Cultists - hideout must be nearby.

Id: [0x000EC696]
[&hmm]This must be the entrance to the hideout.

Id: [0x000EC749]
You should have thought of that when you borrowed the drachmae, Duris.

Id: [0x000EC74A]
But, my family -

Id: [0x000EC74B]
It’s hot. I’m in a bad mood, and you’re going to pay. We both know it. The question is, what do I break first – you or your merchandise.

Id: [0x000EC74C]
Double? That’s robbery.

Id: [0x000EC74D]
That’s what I told Markos.

Id: [0x000EC74E]
You know him, he's... extreme. If you pay him, this will all be over with.

Id: [0x000EC74F]
Fine! The money's yours. Just leave!

Id: [0x000EC752]
Sweep the camp!

Id: [0x000EC753]
Make sure every Spartan is accounted for.

Id: [0x000EC755]
Go on, it's the slow season.

Id: [0x000EC756]
I found these rock fragments near the graffiti. Do you recognize them?

Id: [0x000EC758]
That, my friend, is Emery. Used for various artistic endeavors. Won't give the pottery as good of a shine in that state though.

Id: [0x000EC75B]
Emery? The rock? Is it found on Naxos?

Id: [0x000EC75C]
It's mined from the Routsouna waterfall.

Id: [0x000EC766]
Yes, Polemarch.

Id: [0x000EC78D]
Phoenix sent me. To find and stop the "artist." <i>You</i>.

Id: [0x000EC78E]
You're here to kill me.

Id: [0x000EC791]
Who's "I"?

Id: [0x000EC799]
That's up to you.

Id: [0x000EC79B]
Please, <i>misthios</i>! Phoenix is a <i>great </i>leader - tell her I said that! I'm just the hand, not the mind.

Id: [0x000EC79C]
She is under threat of assassination. My sources say the elite forces are already in Naxos. I cannot watch this happen again.

Id: [0x000EC79F]
Not only that. My people won't believe Paros is behind this without proof. I need you to find it.

Id: [0x000EC7A0]
I don't think anyone sent to kill you is going to admit who they're working for.

Id: [0x000EC7A5]
Tell me why you did it.

Id: [0x000EC7A6]
I was commissioned! A contract from soldiers. They have power! <i>You </i>try defying people like that.

Id: [0x000EC7A7]
I would. I'm not spineless.

Id: [0x000EC7A8]
<i>Misthios</i>, I'm a poor artist! The Archon promised drachmae I've never dreamed of!

Id: [0x000EC7A9]
Then you're a gutless sheep. You write what you don't believe.

Id: [0x000EC7AA]
I didn't know it would go this far.

Id: [0x000EC7B0]
No more graffiti. I promise!

Id: [0x000EC7B1]
You made a mistake. A big one. As long as you own up to it.

Id: [0x000EC7B2]
I do, <i>misthios</i>, I do.

Id: [0x000EC7B3]
If you don't, you'll make an easy kill.

Id: [0x000EC7B7]
And look where it got you.

Id: [0x000EC7B8]
I'll stop now, I promise! Not another word!

Id: [0x000EC7BA]
Here, my contract - see for yourself!

Id: [0x000EC7BD]
We're finished here.

Id: [0x000EC7BE]
You won't hear from me again!

Id: [0x000EC7E8]
Are we going home?

Id: [0x000EC7E9]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000EC7ED]
Kassandra. Brasidas sent me.

Id: [0x000EC80B]
You can read it?

Id: [0x000EC810]
This money isn't from Silanos. [beat]It's from someone in Sparta.

Id: [0x000EC84F]
Ships from Paros have blockaded the harbor.

Id: [0x000EC850]
Tell them I'm on my way.

Id: [0x000EC86A]
Did you not hear what I said? These are their most skilled killers. You cannot stay in the public eye. They'll find you.

Id: [0x000EC8AF]
You want me to handle the Cult's soldiers?

Id: [0x000EC8B1]
You're right. Physical proof is better. I'm sure you can find something.

Id: [0x000EC8B2]
I'll get her out of here safely.

Id: [0x000EC8B4]
Of course.

Id: [0x000EC8B5]
Good. And I'll make the rounds here, shore up my support.

Id: [0x000EC8B9]
Where do your <i>sources</i> say I should start looking?

Id: [0x000EC8BB]
I'd try the caves under Mt. Zas. The Cultists are so enamored with their own mysticism. It's predictable enough for them.

Id: [0x000EC8BD]
Of course. I'd be happy to help you both. I'll see you again later.

Id: [0x000EC8C1]
Take these to the merchants' guild. Tell them it's the proof I promised. And tell them... they can keep the coins.

Id: [0x000EC8C2]
Of course.

Id: [0x000EC8C6]
That's not possible.

Id: [0x000EC8C8]
I can translate it for you. But these orders come from a Spartan king.

Id: [0x000EC8C9]
The Spartan nobility has always resisted the Cult!

Id: [0x000EC8CA]
The Cult is like water. Any crack in the stone and they'll get in.

Id: [0x000ECE46]
[&laughs]And you think the cultists aren't stoking the flames on both sides?

Id: [0x000ECE48]
I've seen what they can do. What they're willing to do. I want what's best for Arkadia... I'll consider what you have to say.

Id: [0x000ECE62]
Thanks. I'm glad to have you around, Barnabas.

Id: [0x000ECE63]
I'm happy to be here. Would anything else help?

Id: [0x000ECE64]
If you're trying to make me feel better, stop.

Id: [0x000ECE65]
What would make you feel better then?

Id: [0x000ECE69]
If you'll follow me, Kassandra.

Id: [0x000ECE77]
Finding my <i>mater</i>. She's alive, Barnabas! At least... Nikolaos thought so.

Id: [0x000ECE78]
Some good news, praise Hera. What's your plan? What course should I set, captain?

Id: [0x000ECE79]
For now, we go to Phokis. Elpenor said he'd meet me there. He owes me money and an explanation.

Id: [0x000ECE7A]
Aye, Kassandra. And let's seek the wisdom of the Pythia while we're there. If anyone has answers for you, it's the Oracle of Delphi.

Id: [0x000ECE7F]
You know more than you let on.

Id: [0x000ECE80]
Knowing you is in my best interest. And knowing <i>me </i>is in yours.

Id: [0x000ECE82]
Tell me who sent you.

Id: [0x000ECE83]
An inquisitive nature - good. That will help.

Id: [0x000ECE87]
How do I know your name? I did what you did. I asked, and people told me.

Id: [0x000ECE8B]
My prized possession was stolen and brought to Ithaka. Penelope's woven shroud. I need you to steal it back.

Id: [0x000ECE9A]
So disappointing.

Id: [0x000ECE9B]
I won't be your puppet anymore!

Id: [0x000ECEA1]
Don't expect it to be easy.

Id: [0x000ECEA2]
That's why it will cost you.

Id: [0x000ECEA4]
Then it's agreed. There's a rowboat in the harbor. Use it. It's not meant for open water, so be wise. When you have the shroud, meet me in the temple of Zeus.

Id: [0x000ECEA7]
Oh, and <i>misthios</i>...

Id: [0x000ECEA9]
Don't fail<i>.</i>

Id: [0x000ECEAB]
The shroud of Penelope? The wife of Odysseus? You're joking.

Id: [0x000ECEAC]
A piece of it, yes.

Id: [0x000ECEAD]
Impossible. If it existed, it would be priceless.

Id: [0x000ECEAE]
Which is why I want it back.

Id: [0x000ECEAF]
Ithaka is not a small island. I need more information.

Id: [0x000ECEB0]
I'd start at the home of Odysseus. Well, what's left of it. An inspiring tale. A reunion of past lovers.

Id: [0x000ECEB2]
You may speak.

Id: [0x000ECEDE]
The young are so impressionable these days. They're always looking for ways to make a name for themselves like the heroes of old. I'm glad it's over.

Id: [0x000ECEE6]
Be safe... and come back to me, lamb.

Id: [0x000ECF0F]
There goes our hope of striking first.

Id: [0x000ECFA4]
Just you against an entire blockade?

Id: [0x000ECFA5]
You're right. It's terrible odds for Paros.

Id: [0x000ED014]
By the gods. What happened here?

Id: [0x000ED01C]
Phoibe! [&scream]No![/&scream]

Id: [0x000ED0EB]
The Oracle's home is probably easy enough to spot. She'd be the only person in the Chora of Delphi who can afford to live in luxury.

Id: [0x000ED0EE]
Where in the Chora of Delphi does the Pythia live?

Id: [0x000ED0F1]
I can't go breaking down every door until I find her.

Id: [0x000ED0FB]
Maybe you'll buy something next time.

Id: [0x000ED10A]
I didn't expect you to believe me, so I brought this.

Id: [0x000ED10C]
Here's your proof. A sample of the special wood you want so badly. These bows you're making had better be worthy of Apollo for all the trouble I've gone to.

Id: [0x000ED10E]
You really should have more faith in people. I said I'd get it done, and I did.

Id: [0x000ED127]
Your moaning won't get the job done any faster. I'll kill the bandits and get your fucking wood back.

Id: [0x000ED128]
I-I know you will! Take your time finding them. [beat]I trust you.

Id: [0x000ED12A]
I'll deal with these bandits and get you the wood you need as fast as I can. Have patience, it won't take long.

Id: [0x000ED12B]
Ha! If you knew how long Markos has been feeding me excuses, you wouldn't be saying that.

Id: [0x000ED15C]
Who are you? How do you know my name?

Id: [0x000ED15D]
I am Elpenor of Kirrha.

Id: [0x000ED165]
I am ready.

Id: [0x000ED166]
Follow me. We must prepare for the battle ahead.

Id: [0x000ED16B]
The Wolf requests the presence of the mercenary.

Id: [0x000ED16C]
We shall be up to him in a moment.

Id: [0x000ED16D]
With respect, he wishes to see the mercenary alone.

Id: [0x000ED16F]
What?!

Id: [0x000ED170]
Those were his orders, sir.

Id: [0x000ED172]
Very well.

Id: [0x000ED174]
It appears I have other matters to attend to.

Id: [0x000ED17D]
I need to find them.

Id: [0x000ED185]
Perikles -[small gasp]

Id: [0x000ED18A]
Stay out of my way!

Id: [0x000ED198]
What do you think of this robe?

Id: [0x000ED199]
Which robe?

Id: [0x000ED19A]
The one I'm wearing, nittarion!

Id: [0x000ED19B]
It is hmmm...

Id: [0x000ED19E]
Such a beautiful robe for such a young-looking lady.

Id: [0x000ED19F]
Oh stop it you, you'll make this old hag blush.

Id: [0x000ED1A1]
No offense but I have, other things to do.

Id: [0x000ED1A2]
I understand, do come back whenever you want my love.

Id: [0x000ED1A7]
You are a love! And what do you think of this necklace?

Id: [0x000ED1A8]
The craft is terrible, hah! It looks like something Euripides would have built using cracked goat horns while being incredibly inebriated!

Id: [0x000ED1A9]
... I have crafted it with my own two hands.

Id: [0x000ED1AA]
Well maybe you should have stayed at pots and poetry.

Id: [0x000ED1AB]
For your own good my dear, I think you should leave. Now.

Id: [0x000ED1AD]
Oh my dear Alexios! It's a shame you wouldn't comment on my robe, but would you care to comment on these earrings?

Id: [0x000ED1AE]
Nope, I really, really ought to go away.

Id: [0x000ED1AF]
Will no one pay attention to me...

Id: [0x000ED1B8]
Sparta stands against corruption!

Id: [0x000ED1BF]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x000ED1C5]
Generals bleed like anyone else.

Id: [0x000ED1C6]
Good.

Id: [0x000ED1C8]
I'm not an assassin.

Id: [0x000ED1C9]
There's a first time for everything.

Id: [0x000ED1CB]
Sparta has changed since we were there. Corruption spreads everywhere, as Aspasia says - even to Sparta. They want to instill discipline across the Greek world while they rot from within. They're focused on the wrong enemy.

Id: [0x000ED1CC]
[beat]I am still Spartan.

Id: [0x000ED1CE]
And so are you.

Id: [0x000ED1D0]
Are you really?

Id: [0x000ED1D2]
I have responsibilities here. Paros needs to be stopped.

Id: [0x000ED1D4]
But then? Yes, I will go back.

Id: [0x000ED1D7]
You did well, <i>misthios</i>. Tell me, how do you feel about killing a general in Megaris?

Id: [0x000ED1F3]
He do something to offend you?

Id: [0x000ED1F4]
Yes... He's costing me drachmae. He's not good for business.

Id: [0x000ED1F9]
Please don't disappoint me, Kassandra. Return when you have the shroud.

Id: [0x000ED23A]
I accept.

Id: [0x000ED250]
The harbor is clear. We need to move out before they send reinforcements.

Id: [0x000ED251]
Kassandra. A word.

Id: [0x000ED25A]
I have no idea.

Id: [0x000ED2FD]
We're almost ready. Timo?

Id: [0x000ED302]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000ED303]
Alexios...

Id: [0x000ED31B]
The ships are loading now. They'll be ready on your command.

Id: [0x000ED31E]
[&breath]Whatever you need.

Id: [0x000ED320]
The Cult must be stopped. When we return to Lakonia, it will be dangerous.

Id: [0x000ED323]
I'm used to it.

Id: [0x000ED327]
Here, I know who I can and cannot trust. I would have said that about Sparta, too. But this news about the King...

Id: [0x000ED328]
Did Aspasia find out <i>which</i> of the kings is working with the Cult?

Id: [0x000ED329]
For all we know, it's both. We must cleanse Sparta of its corruption no matter the cost.

Id: [0x000ED33F]
At least now we can face them together.

Id: [0x000ED340]
Yes. For all that those bastards tried to take from us. And your brother...

Id: [0x000ED342]
Once Paros is dealt with, we will get to work.

Id: [0x000ED343]
You're right.

Id: [0x000ED347]
Come see me when you're ready.

Id: [0x000ED34D]
We will find him.

Id: [0x000ED425]
You know me. Always prepared.

Id: [0x000ED43A]
I said the Commander wishes...

Id: [0x000ED43B]
I heard what you said, I just don't understand why.

Id: [0x000ED440]
Be careful. They're dangerous.

Id: [0x000ED441]
I know.

Id: [0x000ED474]
Stentor sent me. I'm here to help wherever I can.

Id: [0x000ED47C]
How can you say that after all Sparta has done to you? They tore apart our family! They <i>welcomed</i> the Cult with open arms.

Id: [0x000ED481]
Why do you keep saying "they"?

Id: [0x000ED488]
Aspasia? What brings you here?

Id: [0x000ED49F]
I don't see another option. But [&laughs]I have [/&laughs]the best crew on the Aegean.

Id: [0x000ED50D]
With your shield, or on it.

Id: [0x000ED5D5]
I don't care <i>who</i> does it, but someone better gut those bandits. <i>Today.</i>

Id: [0x000ED5DC]
Do this for me and earn <i>double </i>what you earned today. Are you up to the task? [beat]It would take you far away from Kephallonia. So far away you might never return.

Id: [0x000ED5DE]
Who is this general?

Id: [0x000ED5DF]
They call him "The Wolf."

Id: [0x000ED5E0]
Why me?

Id: [0x000ED5E1]
Because no one knows who you are. You're invisible.

Id: [0x000ED5E6]
I don't know what you're talking about.

Id: [0x000ED5E9]
You're back.

Id: [0x000ED5EC]
What happened?

Id: [0x000ED5ED]
We came to talk peace with Paros... They ambushed us.

Id: [0x000ED5F5]
I'll get him.

Id: [0x000ED5F6]
Make them pay.

Id: [0x000ED601]
Have they finished with Euneas yet?

Id: [0x000ED603]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]No, the old dog is still breathing.

Id: [0x000ED604]
Only a matter of time until the boss or the heat breaks him.

Id: [0x000ED605]
He'll never betray Naxos. The boss is wasting his time.

Id: [0x000ED60A]
You're a hard man to kill.

Id: [0x000ED60C]
I <i>knew </i>she wouldn't abandon me. Quick, let's get out of here.

Id: [0x000ED613]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. I hope Phoenix pays you well for this.

Id: [0x000ED614]
Remind her for me.

Id: [0x000ED615]
Something's wrong with Paros - more than usual. Strange things are afoot.

Id: [0x000ED61B]
What did you see?

Id: [0x000ED61C]
There were others - not the Paros type. One had a mask - never seen that before.

Id: [0x000ED61D]
A mask? Hm.

Id: [0x000ED61F]
You're alive. You dealt with them just fine.

Id: [0x000ED620]
I'll strategize from Naxos starting now.

Id: [0x000ED621]
Good idea.

Id: [0x000ED623]
Time to get off this gods-forsaken island. I know my way back.

Id: [0x000ED624]
You should tell Phoenix what you saw.

Id: [0x000ED625]
I'll report to her at once.

Id: [0x000ED631]
Maybe I should have another look.

Id: [0x000ED635]
This is the one I want.

Id: [0x000ED636]
Are you sure, because -

Id: [0x000ED637]
I'm sure, Markos.

Id: [0x000ED658]
Good. I hope it's sturdy.

Id: [0x000ED681]
Enough, I didn't come here for a debate.

Id: [0x000ED6B2]
Is something wrong?

Id: [0x000ED6B3]
Besides the attacks on my island and the Cult's meddling? No. But we must speak privately.

Id: [0x000ED6F6]
Now that we have the necessary resources, we can upgrade the ship's hull.

Id: [0x000ED6FB]
Poseidon be praised! She’s in ramming shape now. Like a fist in the ocean.

Id: [0x000ED702]
Alexios is alive.

Id: [0x000ED70E]
So what'll it be? Ready to put this life behind you?

Id: [0x000ED710]
Be safe, Kynna!

Id: [0x000ED711]
Bye Kynna! Be safe!

Id: [0x000ED71F]
And now we strike a blow to the Cult.

Id: [0x000ED733]
I'll be fine.

Id: [0x000ED736]
He's too far gone.

Id: [0x000ED737]
I gave up on you both once - never again.

Id: [0x000ED738]
But she'll be your friend now, and it'll be like I'm there with you. You know, to remind you of me.

Id: [0x000ED766]
Time to go.

Id: [0x000ED8C7]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x000ED8CA]
What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?

Id: [0x000ED8CB]
I - no.

Id: [0x000ED8CC]
My great warrior hasn't even arrived yet! Gather yourself and hold your tongue, fool. Show respect for the bloodline.

Id: [0x000ED8E5]
Every time I see it, it calls to me and sings. Of <i>power.</i> Does it call to you like it calls to me?

Id: [0x000ED8F0]
It does.

Id: [0x000ED8F1]
It does. It's impressive.

Id: [0x000ED8F2]
Yes. Show your reverence.

Id: [0x000ED8F4]
What we have now is everything. Hera has blessed me. My great warrior is leading our army to victory. Can you imagine the <i>pride</i> I feel?

Id: [0x000ED904]
Our champion will destroy our enemies before they even <i>think</i> to kneel. Mark my words.

Id: [0x000ED907]
Then you have a thing or two left to learn. I raised our champion to bring us to <i>ultimate</i> glory. Wait and see.

Id: [0x000ED97F]
Thinks he can tell me about grapes...

Id: [0x000EDA0D]
Fine, but I’m taking a horse. It’s too hot and too long a walk to go on foot.

Id: [0x000EDA0E]
But –

Id: [0x000EDA0F]
Think of it as interest, Markos. Everybody benefits.

Id: [0x000EDA10]
Of course, my friend, you shall have your pick!

Id: [0x000EDA34]
Phobos.

Id: [0x000EDA35]
Remember, meet me at the temple in Sami when you have, uh, your money from Duris.

Id: [0x000EDAAE]
We'll take my ship.

Id: [0x000EDB8E]
Brasidas was right. The Cult is holding Lagos's family hostage.

Id: [0x000EDB8F]
How do you want to handle this one?

Id: [0x000EDB90]
Not like you handled that olive oil business.  That was - that was too much.

Id: [0x000EDB91]
I got the money.

Id: [0x000EDB92]
And now we'll never get any <i>more</i> from him. If you kill them all, <i>nobody</i> benefits.

Id: [0x000EDB93]
Threatening them and maybe more... Breaking things, certainly. Steal the money if you have to, but don't rob me of my customers. Unless you can't avoid it. These things happen.

Id: [0x000EDB99]
You. We need another opinion on this.

Id: [0x000EDB9B]
I'm still not convinced.

Id: [0x000EDB9C]
Why split resources searching for a woman we can't <i>find</i>? If we narrow our focus, Athens will be ours. Immediate threats have to be destroyed. <i>Perikles</i> has to be destroyed.

Id: [0x000EDB9D]
Not without the mother. We aren't strong enough without the mother.

Id: [0x000EDB9E]
Don't let Deimos hear that. If anything, we should be hunting the father.

Id: [0x000EDB9F]
[&breath]We know who the mother is. Looking for the father would be a waste of resources.

Id: [0x000EDBA0]
What do you think? Hunt the Champion's mother or his father?

Id: [0x000EDBA6]
Neither.

Id: [0x000EDBA7]
You have a better idea?

Id: [0x000EDBA8]
No. Go after <i>her.</i>

Id: [0x000EDBA9]
The sibling. Kassandra.

Id: [0x000EDBAA]
She's as good as ours already. We need to look to the <i>future</i>.

Id: [0x000EDBBB]
...The father.

Id: [0x000EDBBC]
What did I tell you?

Id: [0x000EDBC0]
You're both wrong.

Id: [0x000EDBC1]
Now if you'll excuse me.

Id: [0x000EDBC6]
...The mother.

Id: [0x000EDBC7]
She's right.

Id: [0x000EDBC8]
Get your priorities straight. Before you know it, Perikles will shore up his defenses, and we will have lost our chance.

Id: [0x000EDCF1]
Only in whispers... Ever since my husband found new "business partners," they've stationed guards around our home. For our safety, he said. Then one day, those guards dragged us here.

Id: [0x000EDD2D]
<i>Aniazo</i>[I'm sorry].

Id: [0x000EDD5C]
Elpenor is dead!

Id: [0x000EDD60]
You!!!

Id: [0x000EDD64]
Everyone will be tested.

Id: [0x000EDD66]
You. First.

Id: [0x000EDD69]
Go.

Id: [0x000EDD6B]
You.

Id: [0x000EDD6D]
Go.

Id: [0x000EDD6F]
You.

Id: [0x000EDD77]
Go.

Id: [0x000EDD79]
You! Get up here.

Id: [0x000EDD81]
The traitor is dead!

Id: [0x000EDDA6]
It's only blood right now, but who knows. Deimos may ask for our <i>hands</i> next.

Id: [0x000EDDA8]
Go on, go on, make your offering.

Id: [0x000EDDAF]
I think there's something you should do first.

Id: [0x000EDDB0]
What?

Id: [0x000EDDB1]
You need to find your father.

Id: [0x000EDDBB]
Who is he?

Id: [0x000EDDBE]
I think I've dealt with enough fathers for one lifetime.

Id: [0x000EDDBF]
I don't blame you for that. But there are things you need to know if we are to stop the Cult.

Id: [0x000EDDC1]
You'll find what you need on the island of Thera. I've given your navigator the course.

Id: [0x000EDDC4]
He's a difficult man to describe. He's many things, but the only way to truly know him is to meet him yourself.

Id: [0x000EDDC5]
Like what?

Id: [0x000EDDC8]
Thera.

Id: [0x000EDDD0]
I'll pass.

Id: [0x000EDDD2]
The blood is for the <i>cause -</i> not the boy. Make your sacrifice.

Id: [0x000EDDD3]
Oh. Sorry.

Id: [0x000EDE3A]
We just have to keep our sights on what the bloodline will do for us.

Id: [0x000EDE3B]
The bloodline?

Id: [0x000EDE3C]
The mother, the father, the sister - you know, his kin. We need them. <i>All </i>of them.

Id: [0x000EDE3D]
...To use them.

Id: [0x000EDE4B]
[&breath]So you won't tell me now.

Id: [0x000EDE54]
I'm sick of this job. It's boring as dirt.

Id: [0x000EDE55]
Could be worse, could be us guarding the hideout next to the farmhouse.

Id: [0x000EDE57]
Hopefully that slack-jawed messenger will be here soon.

Id: [0x000EDE60]
That information is <i>not</i> for Deimos, of course. You know how volatile he is. He could rip through us <i>easily</i>.

Id: [0x000EDE70]
You know where she is?

Id: [0x000EDE71]
[beat]No. But it won't be long until we do. I assure you. She's the Cult's next target.

Id: [0x000EDE79]
I would lower my voice if I were you. Just know she will be put to... good use. Unless she's uncontrollable.

Id: [0x000EDE7A]
And do what with her?

Id: [0x000EDE84]
These tracks lead away from the drop-off. They're fresh, too.

Id: [0x000EDE86]
I have to go.

Id: [0x000EDE88]
To our great ambition.

Id: [0x000EDE89]
...To ambition.

Id: [0x000EDE93]
Megaris.

Id: [0x000EDE94]
[&laughs]Megaris!

Id: [0x000EDE95]
I got a contract for some general's head.

Id: [0x000EDE96]
The Wolf! Who wants Nikolaos of Sparta dead?

Id: [0x000EDEA2]
Speaking of Deimos, he'll be arriving soon. Prepare yourself.

Id: [0x000EDEA4]
So, what course do we set? Where in this big, beautiful world does the mighty Kassandra want to go?

Id: [0x000EDEA7]
Whose head?

Id: [0x000EDEA8]
They call him "The Wolf."

Id: [0x000EDEAC]
You've avoided the past long enough. Now you will answer to me.

Id: [0x000EDEB3]
Though you deserve death, there is no honor in vengeance.

Id: [0x000EDEB6]
You must face the ghosts of your past, <i>pater</i>. And that is a fate worse than death.

Id: [0x000EDEB7]
I have failed in my duty.  I failed to protect you... to protect both of you.

Id: [0x000EDEBA]
I loved you – and your brother as if you were truly my own. But you were never mine.

Id: [0x000EDEBB]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000EDEBC]
That is a question you should ask your mother.

Id: [0x000EDEBE]
Wait -

Id: [0x000EDEBF]
Find your mother.

Id: [0x000EDEC0]
Find her?

Id: [0x000EDEC1]
Wherever Myrrine is, she knows far more than I do.

Id: [0x000EDEC3]
Where will you go?

Id: [0x000EDEC5]
To find my honor.

Id: [0x000EDEC7]
Beware the snakes in the grass, Kassandra.

Id: [0x000EDF8F]
TBW: Warrior Greeting.

Id: [0x000EDF9B]
Let me introduce myself. My soldiers call me The Lion of the Dyrads. We don't keep prisoners in these parts - everyone captured is food for the dryad nymphs living in the trees. You join forces with me, and you have the strength of every blood-hungry forest spirit on your side.

Id: [0x000EDFAE]
What were you thinking of?

Id: [0x000EDFB8]
I don't have time for that right now.

Id: [0x000EDFC0]
You're not going to finish the contract hanging around here.

Id: [0x000EE582]
Earth, mother of all, I greet you.

Id: [0x000EE58A]
You helped my family when I couldn't. Even if we're apart, I know they're safe thanks to you.

Id: [0x000EE58B]
I know it was you who freed my family. They're safe thanks to you.

Id: [0x000EE592]
Get me to Megaris. Now.

Id: [0x000EE593]
But I don't understand. Of all the places under Helios, why risk our necks to go there?

Id: [0x000EE594]
The Wolf of Sparta is my father.

Id: [0x000EE599]
[&ahem]Maláka! Myrrine won't be happy about this.

Id: [0x000EE5A0]
There's no room for error in the pursuit of victory.

Id: [0x000EE5A3]
I'll be sure to keep it to myself.

Id: [0x000EE5A4]
As you should. [beat]Nor can he know we're about to capture his mother.

Id: [0x000EE5A5]
I couldn't tell who he was.

Id: [0x000EE5A9]
The gods as my witness! I swear!

Id: [0x000EE5AA]
Which ones?

Id: [0x000EE5AB]
What difference does it make–[ONO, glurg]

Id: [0x000EE5AD]
[ONO, gasp]All of them! I swear! All of them!

Id: [0x000EE5AF]
I’ve never heard so much fucking god talk from one man in all my days.

Id: [0x000EE5B0]
Let him go.

Id: [0x000EE5B2]
No one on this island is allowed to say that word!

Id: [0x000EE5B3]
Did he say Cyclops? Did he hurt your feelings?

Id: [0x000EE5B5]
My eye! Give it to me!

Id: [0x000EE5B7]
Give it to me and I won’t kill Markos for having you steal it. Give it to me!!!

Id: [0x000EE74D]
Please, find my father! Find Leiandros!

Id: [0x000EE754]
You came! I was sure I'd fight alone.

Id: [0x000EE755]
I'll stand with you, Leiandros. No matter what happens today, Amara will be proud of her fath-

Id: [0x000EE757]
I see you're still a Minotaur.

Id: [0x000EE758]
I've faced many of the Greek world's deadliest warriors in this mask.

Id: [0x000EE75A]
Are you ready to save my daughter? We should hurry, I'm-I'm finding it quite hard to breathe under this mask.

Id: [0x000EE760]
And you look it. It would be an honor to fight alongside the mythical Minotaur.

Id: [0x000EE761]
Yes! YES! <i>MOOOO!</i>

Id: [0x000EE762]
Don't do that.

Id: [0x000EE764]
You look like the one thing in the world Alkibiades wouldn't take to bed ...Can you even see out of that thing?

Id: [0x000EE765]
Mock all you want. When those malákes in Zakros see this beast charging towards them, [projected]they will know fear!

Id: [0x000EE76B]
We charge!

Id: [0x000EE76E]
We don't - not yet. The way you tell it, Zakros is a fortress. I'll need to prepare.

Id: [0x000EE771]
They must be keeping her underground. With hooves and heroics, we shall save her.

Id: [0x000EE776]
Prepare to be Mina-<i>torn apart</i>!

Id: [0x000EE782]
[&ah]Is that the Minotaur?!

Id: [0x000EE78A]
Show her.

Id: [0x000EE78C]
...Father...? <i>You're</i> the Minotaur?!

Id: [0x000EE78D]
Maybe don't tell your mother.

Id: [0x000EE78E]
I waited and waited and - you weren't going to leave me here, were you? You were just working on your plan to save me, right <i>pater</i>?

Id: [0x000EE78F]
[beat]Of course. I was always coming for you, I just... needed to find something first.

Id: [0x000EE795]
Yes, that... absolutely is the real, authentic Minotaur.

Id: [0x000EE796]
It's all right now, Amara. No one will ever hurt you again, not while I - <i>the Mighty Minotaur</i> - am here to protect you.

Id: [0x000EE7BE]
You did this?

Id: [0x000EE7C3]
Misthios! Did you ever talk to my husband? If he knows anything about my daughter's disappearance, help him, or... or stop him! Please, do whatever must be done to find my Amara!

Id: [0x000EE7C6]
Where is my daughter...? Where is my Amara...? Anyone, please... Help me... Please...

Id: [0x000EE7D2]
Thank Leiandros. When the time came for action, he charged, despite being outskilled and... out-costumed. He fought courageously. [beat]Your husband is no coward.

Id: [0x000EE7D4]
No thanks to that coward you call a husband.

Id: [0x000EE8D8]
BEWARE BEAST! For soon I shall use your spinal column as an eating utensil!

Id: [0x000EE8D9]
Don't warn him.

Id: [0x000EE8DF]
Look, a warrior whose bravery may nearly equals our own!

Id: [0x000EE8E0]
Join us, slightly-less-than-equal warrior!

Id: [0x000EE8E7]
And you must be... the "warriors."

Id: [0x000EE8E8]
Look, brother - the final member of our Minotaur-hunting party has arrived!

Id: [0x000EE8E9]
If it's all right with both of you, I'd like to strike the killing blow.

Id: [0x000EE8EB]
The Minotaur calls... WILL YOU ANSWER?!

Id: [0x000EE903]
Not yet - I need more time.

Id: [0x000EE913]
Behold brother; the home of the Minotaur!

Id: [0x000EE914]
Isn't he supposed to live in a labyrinth?

Id: [0x000EE915]
That's a myth.

Id: [0x000EE916]
Isn't the <i>Minotaur</i> a myth?

Id: [0x000EE917]
No, he's the half-bull, half-human bastard son of King Minos's wife.

Id: [0x000EE918]
...Sounds like a myth to me.

Id: [0x000EE91C]
These bodies have arrow wounds and cuts from weapons too small to be wielded by a Minotaur.

Id: [0x000EE91E]
These bodies haven't been torn apart by a Minotaur, they've been... arranged?

Id: [0x000EE92B]
Please, no - they made me! Don't kill me!

Id: [0x000EE92F]
...Ahh! No, wait. Please, I am no beast!

Id: [0x000EE931]
No-no-no-no, stop! You're killing me!

Id: [0x000EE938]
Tell me what's going on, or I'll cut it out of you. [beat]And take off that <i>malákas</i> mask.

Id: [0x000EE93A]
Leiandros?!

Id: [0x000EE93B]
I'm happy to refund any expenses incurred -

Id: [0x000EE93D]
Please, it's my daughter, Amara! Masked men are holding her captive deep in the canyons of Dikte Plateau.

Id: [0x000EE95D]
Tell me about your daughter.

Id: [0x000EE95E]
Amara... The sound of her laughter is sunlight on my skin. She is joy, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000EE960]
You said the Cult - the "masked men" have your daughter in the canyons of Dikte Plateau -

Id: [0x000EE961]
But only one holds Amara. There's a place called Zakros - an ancient ruin, and a bastion of the masked men's power. I go there every night, hoping to catch a glimpse of her.

Id: [0x000EE96A]
Tell me, whose face would Amara wish to see rescue her? Mine? ...Or her father's? <i>Be brave</i>, Leiandros.

Id: [0x000EE96B]
Bravery. Yes. You're right, <i>misthios.</i> No matter what, I must be there for my Amara. Please, will you join me?

Id: [0x000EE96D]
She's your daughter. You must save her!

Id: [0x000EE96E]
But they'd cut me down! You think she would want to see her father die?!

Id: [0x000EE96F]
She would want her father to protect her!

Id: [0x000EE970]
You're right. I'm a coward. And a man cannot be any more than he is. That's enough for me, but... [beat]it's not enough to save Amara. For that, I'll need your help.

Id: [0x000EE976]
We will save your daughter... together.

Id: [0x000EE977]
Thank you, misthios. Meet me outside the ruins of Zakros on Dikte Plateau. That's where my daughter is, and where I must be.

Id: [0x000EE97A]
I can't fight your battles for you, Leiandros.

Id: [0x000EE97B]
If you change your mind, meet me outside the ruins of Zakros on Dikte Plateau. That's... that's where I need to be.

Id: [0x000EE9E3]
What do you want, Phoibe?

Id: [0x000EE9E4]
You know Kausos?

Id: [0x000EE9E5]
The town on the other side of the island? Why?

Id: [0x000EE9E6]
People there are sick - and my friend Kynna is too. There's a blood fever. They say it's a curse and that they need help from the gods.

Id: [0x000EE9E8]
I told you. I'm not a god.

Id: [0x000EE9E9]
But, Ikaros –

Id: [0x000EE9EA]
Is a bird.

Id: [0x000EE9EB]
That doesn't mean you can't help!

Id: [0x000EE9ED]
All right, I'll look into it.

Id: [0x000EEA18]
The seas are treacherous now. Well, more than usual. It would be suicide.

Id: [0x000EEA19]
Not sure if this helps, but rumor has it the Cyclops is coming for you and Markos.

Id: [0x000EEA25]
There's a great view up ahead. We'll leave our horses here.

Id: [0x000EEA37]
It doesn't matter where I got the information.

Id: [0x000EEA38]
You should know by now that I'm not one to follow orders blindly.

Id: [0x000EEA39]
You are a brave warrior, Myrrine. But ignoring this danger is foolishness. These...

Id: [0x000EEA3A]
I know who they are.

Id: [0x000EEA3B]
Then you know the danger you're in.

Id: [0x000EEA3C]
I would like to know what makes you so certain they're coming.

Id: [0x000EEA3F]
So... you have a ship.

Id: [0x000EEA40]
Of course! Gods forbid I'd end up stuck in this place.

Id: [0x000EEA41]
Ah, where are my manners? I am Barnabas, captain of the Adrestia.

Id: [0x000EEA54]
Well, Barnabas. I am pleased to meet you. I'm Kassandra, <i>misthios</i> by trade.

Id: [0x000EEA56]
You truly aren't from around here.

Id: [0x000EEA58]
[&laughs]Gods, no! And I thank them for that. Come now and see the Adrestia.

Id: [0x000EEA5B]
You’re full of shit. Another drunken captain full of tall tales.

Id: [0x000EEA5C]
Can’t be a captain without a ship though can ya?

Id: [0x000EEA5D]
Don’t you touch my ship! By the gods I uttered not a word of a lie.

Id: [0x000EEA5E]
Let’s see how the gods favor you now [laughs]

Id: [0x000EEA7E]
The eastern coast. Can you be more specific?

Id: [0x000EEA7F]
I think they've settled in an abandoned house. By a small forest - south of Sami!

Id: [0x000EEA94]
Ah, Kassandra! I-I can tell from the smile on your face Duris has paid you your drachmae.

Id: [0x000EEA95]
Who's smiling? I just heard where you got the drachmae for the vineyard. Are you out of your fucking mind?

Id: [0x000EEAB6]
So if these visitors aren't from Kephallonia, where did they come from?

Id: [0x000EEAB7]
All I know is Kephallonia will be the <i>last </i>place they'll ever see.

Id: [0x000EEAD9]
Are you crazy? You borrow his drachmae,<i> then </i>you steal his eye?

Id: [0x000EEAE0]
All right, I'll do it.

Id: [0x000EEAE1]
I will.

Id: [0x000EEAE8]
You don't want it? After all that?

Id: [0x000EEAE9]
I gained something more valuable today.

Id: [0x000EEAEB]
If I knew any better, I'd think you were testing me.

Id: [0x000EEB37]
I don’t like it when people call me that!

Id: [0x000EEB38]
But you’re so fat – I mean big and strong - and you really do only have one eye.

Id: [0x000EEB39]
[ONO, catching breath]I didn't!!! I -[ONO, gasp]

Id: [0x000EEB40]
I'm going to destroy everything you ever created. Athens is mine.

Id: [0x000F19CF]
Take cover! I'll find you when I know it's safe.

Id: [0x000F1A31]
Well, good! GREAT! I WANT you to fight the Minotaur!

Id: [0x000F1A46]
You... are very fit... <i>misthios!</i> You'd make... a fine Minotaur!

Id: [0x000F1A47]
Always good to have a back-up career.

Id: [0x000F1A63]
Fine. But you won't get away with being cheap.

Id: [0x000F1A6A]
I have some things to ask you.

Id: [0x000F1A6B]
I'll get the tablet for you, and deal with the one responsible.

Id: [0x000F1A6C]
Thank you.<i> Errosso</i>[Goodbye].

Id: [0x000F1A6D]
Did you find the coward who did this?

Id: [0x000F1A6E]
So, did you find the traitor?

Id: [0x000F1A6F]
Good.

Id: [0x000F1A70]
Did you locate the one responsible?

Id: [0x000F1A72]
There you are. I've been looking for you.

Id: [0x000F1A73]
You know my help doesn't come cheap, Photios.

Id: [0x000F1A74]
You're going to have to go priest-hunting alone, Photios.

Id: [0x000F1A75]
So, I'm hunting priests. Where do I start?

Id: [0x000F1A76]
Shouldn't be long before I find them.

Id: [0x000F1A77]
Take a break. I have some questions.

Id: [0x000F1A78]
<i>Chaire</i>, old man.

Id: [0x000F1A7A]
Good news. Found the sapphires.

Id: [0x000F1A7C]
Let's hope not, or you'll send another mercenary after <i>me</i>. Goodbye, Photios.

Id: [0x000F1A96]
Shine in the light of Apollo.

Id: [0x000F1AA7]
You want it?

Id: [0x000F1AA9]
Go get it.

Id: [0x000F2398]
I've always wanted more mobility to sell my wares. This sounds like the perfect opportunity.

Id: [0x000F239E]
Me? I'm flattered, <i>misthios</i>. But we both know my hands are too delicate to row.

Id: [0x000F23D4]
I'll come back when I'm done.

Id: [0x000F23D6]
I'll be back when everything's taken care of.

Id: [0x000F23D8]
You can leave everything to me.

Id: [0x000F23DA]
Leave it to me.

Id: [0x000F23DC]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x000F23DE]
Everything's been taken care of.

Id: [0x000F23E0]
It's done. You and I make a good team.

Id: [0x000F23E2]
Everything went according to plan.

Id: [0x000F23E4]
I said I'd do it. I always keep my word.

Id: [0x000F23E6]
I've taken care of everything.

Id: [0x000F23E8]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000F23EA]
That'll do.

Id: [0x000F23EC]
I always finish what I've started.

Id: [0x000F23EE]
Happy to help.

Id: [0x000F23F0]
All in a day's work.

Id: [0x000F23F2]
I could use someone with your skills. Would you consider joining my crew?

Id: [0x000F23F4]
I have a good crew, but we're missing someone with your talents. I want you on board with us. What do you say?

Id: [0x000F23F6]
I've been looking for someone like you, and can offer you a chance to see the world, if you'd join my crew.

Id: [0x000F23F8]
Doesn't look this life is offering you much, but another awaits aboard my ship. Sail with me - we need someone like you.

Id: [0x000F23FA]
You're strong, capable, and obviously resourceful. I could use someone like you on my crew. What do you say?

Id: [0x000F23FC]
It didn't go well.

Id: [0x000F23FE]
There were complications. <i>Serious</i> complications.

Id: [0x000F2400]
I got there... but things went from bad to worse. It was chaos.

Id: [0x000F2402]
The gods weren't smiling on us today.

Id: [0x000F2404]
Things didn't turn out how I expected. [beat]How either of us expected.

Id: [0x000F2406]
I did what I had to.

Id: [0x000F2408]
It wasn't what you wanted but... it <i>was</i> necessary.

Id: [0x000F240A]
I did what I could.

Id: [0x000F240C]
It's in the past now.

Id: [0x000F240E]
What's done is done.

Id: [0x000F2410]
It's going to take more time.

Id: [0x000F2412]
I need more time.

Id: [0x000F2414]
This is going to take longer than I thought.

Id: [0x000F2416]
I'm still working on it.

Id: [0x000F2418]
These things take time.

Id: [0x000F241A]
The gods are smiling on you. I've already done it.

Id: [0x000F241C]
That's all you needed? Sounds like you already owe me some drachmae.

Id: [0x000F241E]
Consider yourself lucky. It's already been taken care of.

Id: [0x000F2420]
Sounds like you can stop worrying - I've taken care of everything.

Id: [0x000F2422]
You haven't heard? That's already been taken care of. [beat]By me.

Id: [0x000F26EB]
Ah, you had the last piece. <i>Now </i>it is ready.

Id: [0x000F26FE]
And here comes the Eagle Bearer herself. My guards told me you were coming.

Id: [0x000F2700]

I will be here when you come back, my friend!

Id: [0x000F3990]
Your man is dead.

Id: [0x000F3991]
She's no longer your concern.

Id: [0x000F3994]
I took care of them. Every last one.

Id: [0x000F3997]
The beast is dead.

Id: [0x000F399C]
You're safe now.

Id: [0x000F399D]
He's free now. You have nothing to worry about.

Id: [0x000F399E]
I got her out safe and sound.

Id: [0x000F399F]
It's been taken care of.

Id: [0x000F39A6]
He's safe thanks to me.

Id: [0x000F39A7]
I kept her safe.

Id: [0x000F39A8]
No harm came to them under my watch.

Id: [0x000F39A9]
You're safe now.

Id: [0x000F39AE]
Here, I brought it back for you.

Id: [0x000F39AF]
This belongs to you.

Id: [0x000F39B0]
It's all yours.

Id: [0x000F39B1]
He won't be bothering anyone anymore.

Id: [0x000F39B2]
She's no longer a concern.

Id: [0x000F39B4]
It's been smashed to pieces, just like you asked.

Id: [0x000F39B5]
It would be hard to piece them back together.

Id: [0x000F39C4]
He... didn't make it.

Id: [0x000F39C5]
I tried to free her, but there was a struggle. She didn't survive.

Id: [0x000F39C6]
I tried to free it from its cage, but... it didn't work out.

Id: [0x000F39C7]
I tried to free them, but there was a fight. [beat]It didn't end well.

Id: [0x000F39D8]
He didn't make it.

Id: [0x000F39D9]
She didn't make it.

Id: [0x000F3A11]
After everything I've done to help, you call <i>me</i> a liar? Keep your drachmae.

Id: [0x000F3A13]
[sigh]Never mind. There's easier ways to make drachmae than this.

Id: [0x000F3A15]
So I lied. Keep your drachmae.

Id: [0x000F3A17]
Lying seemed like a good way to make some easy drachmae.

Id: [0x000F3A19]
Can you blame me for lying when you offered such a pathetic reward?

Id: [0x000F3A4D]
Ok, I won't wait after you my friend!

Id: [0x000F3DEC]
I told you - I've paid Markos enough.

Id: [0x000F3DF1]
What are you doing? Stop that!

Id: [0x000F3DF3]
Stop breaking things!

Id: [0x000F3DF6]
<i>Maláka</i>! You bring the Cyclops into this and then you and I will have a serious problem. Understand?

Id: [0x000F3DFA]
Please don't disappoint me, Kassandra. Return when you have the shroud.

Id: [0x000F3E00]
If you have the money we can talk, if not... I've work to do.

Id: [0x000F3E05]
We shouldn't delay here any further. Even rats like these have friends on Kephallonia.

Id: [0x000F3E17]
So, what happened?

Id: [0x000F3E18]
I need to keep looking, there's still some pieces missing.

Id: [0x000F3E1E]
Have you found the culprits?

Not yet.

Id: [0x000F423B]

Thank the gods! <i>Misthios</i>, I need your help.

Id: [0x000F4248]
We've been ravaged by storms and rough seas! Poseidon is angry.

Id: [0x000F4250]
There are hundreds of axes around - just use another.

Id: [0x000F4251]
The gods?

Id: [0x000F425D]
Thank you for [beat]<i>a tiny portion?!</i>

Id: [0x000F425E]
Pephka is no longer safe for us. Freeing Amara will bring repercussions from people who are [beat]not known to be forgiving. But we're alive, and whatever future we have - we have it only because of you.

Id: [0x000F426C]
I do, but not for Poseidon - for Swordfish.

Id: [0x000F428A]
You say somebody stole something?

Id: [0x000F428B]
[rhetorically]Somebody stole something? Look around. Bandits took almost everything. And worst of all, they stole my family's vase. After so many generations, it's gone.

Id: [0x000F4294]
I'll find your vase, but I'll need some ideas of where to look for it.

Id: [0x000F42AD]
Have you found my vase?

Id: [0x000F42B6]
It was taken by bandits hiding in the copper mine north of here.

Id: [0x000F42B7]
Well, you returned it, so at least there's some justice. Here's the reward I promised.

Id: [0x000F42BC]
It turns out your slave told the bandits to loot your home and take the vase.

Id: [0x000F42BE]
What? Can this be true?

Id: [0x000F42BF]
Yes, master. If you'll allow me to make atonement, I'll...

Id: [0x000F42C0]
Atonement? Never. I won't allow a slave who tells bandits to steal from his master to work for me.

Id: [0x000F42CB]
Your master tells me you might've learned something about the missing vase.

Id: [0x000F42CC]
I have.

Id: [0x000F42D7]
I don't like conditional deals like this. I have a job to do.

Id: [0x000F42E2]
Remember what we talked about when you return it to my master.

Id: [0x000F45FE]
Nikolaos, the Wolf of Sparta. He was impressed with my skill when I was a boy and took me under his wing. He trained me himself and eventually adopted me into his house. He is my father and mentor. I live to make him proud. Surely you've heard of him?

Id: [0x000F4617]
TBW: Warrior Low reputation declaration.

Id: [0x000F4619]
What is a mercenary doing sailing into a war they aren't being paid to fight in? Tell me why you're really here before I cut you down for wasting my time.

Id: [0x000F461D]
The only thing I smell is lies. You're a sell-sword. The only thing you're here for is to try and kill the Wolf like all the rest.

Id: [0x000F461E]
I saw fellow Spartans in trouble and thought you could use the help of a well armed mercenary.

Id: [0x000F461F]
We are Spartans. We do not need anything from the likes of <i>you</i>, but my father taught me to use every resource at my disposal. I could make use of you.

Id: [0x000F4620]
I've come to meet the Wolf of Sparta.

Id: [0x000F4623]
You cannot simply meet with Nikolaos. He has command of the entire Spartan army. If you truly came all this way to meet him, you might be disappointed.

Id: [0x000F4624]
Are you sure you're in charge here? You don't strike me as a typical Spartan. Perhaps it's best if I just talk with Nikolaos.

Id: [0x000F4625]
A sense of humor is not a trait I see being useful for a sell-sword. If you're here to earn drachmae though, I could make use of a capable mercenary.

Id: [0x000F4626]
It's my honor to serve Sparta.

Id: [0x000F4627]
The Athenian blockade was a desperate attempt to stop our advance through Megaris. Now, we can prepare to drive them from this region once and for all. Our forward scouts are identifying key targets in preparation for our assault. Under the Wolf's command, we shall be victorious.

Id: [0x000F462B]
Speak quickly, misthios. I don't have time for idle chatter.

Id: [0x000F462C]
I have questions.

Id: [0x000F462D]
Make it quick.

Id: [0x000F4632]
Your father. Who is he exactly?

Id: [0x000F4633]
Just rumors really.

Id: [0x000F4634]
I doubt they do him justice. He is a great warrior and a greater general. I'd follow him to the gates of the underworld.

Id: [0x000F4635]
How goes the war effort?

Id: [0x000F4636]
If we can draw the leader out and eliminate him, we will crush the Athenians on the battlefield and drive their forces all the way back to Athens. Destroying their supplies, stealing their war chest, and killing their elite troops should leave him vulnerable.

Id: [0x000F4637]
I think I know what must be done.

Id: [0x000F4638]
Remember, every Athenian soldier you eliminate will also help us achieve victory.

Id: [0x000F4639]
Where is the Athenian leader?

Id: [0x000F463A]
He is in Megara, hiding behind stone walls and a full garrison of troops. But if you kill his troops, destroy his supplies, and steal his riches, then he'll be open to attack.

Id: [0x000F463B]
What supplies should I destroy?

Id: [0x000F463C]

<i>Misthios</i>. I've heard you're just the partner I need.

Id: [0x000F55E1]
<i>Misthios</i>. Your reputation precedes you. I wonder how interested you'd be in working together.

Id: [0x000F55E2]
Well, well. The Eagle Bearer I've heard so much about. I've been considering you as a potential ally for awhile now.

Id: [0x000F55E3]
Hm. The legendary mercenary my men can't stop whispering about. You know, I might be interested in working with you.

Id: [0x000F55E4]
Eagle Bearer. I've heard quite the stories about you. I think we might be able to turn a pretty profit... if we team up.

Id: [0x000F55E5]
Eagle Bearer. The stories that follow you around are the stuff of legends.

Id: [0x000F55E6]
<i>Chaire</i>, <i>misthios</i>. You must have had quite the influence on the Greek world if I've heard so much about you.

Id: [0x000F55E7]
<i>Misthios</i>. I've heard of your influence on the Greek world.

Id: [0x000F55E8]
Eagle Bearer. You seem to be someone worth knowing. Or at any rate, someone well known.

Id: [0x000F55E9]
I'm looking forward to finding out how a mere mercenary became so legendary. I've heard a lot about you.

Id: [0x000F55EA]
If it isn't the legendary Eagle Bearer. I've heard a lot about your adventures.

Id: [0x000F55EB]
Ah, the Messenger of Zeus. I don't know how true the stories are but you've clearly been quite influential wherever you go.

Id: [0x000F55EC]
If it isn't the mighty <i>misthios</i> my advisors have been insisting I meet. I've heard all about your adventures.

Id: [0x000F55ED]
Ah, Eagle Bearer. My advisors have told me a great deal about you.

Id: [0x000F55EE]
<i>Chaire</i>, <i>misthios</i>. My advisors have briefed me on the impact you've had across the land. Some of their stories were quite extraordinary.

Id: [0x000F55F0]
Born ugly, I learned early on you can't force someone to love you... but you can make them revere you out of fear. I embraced the nickname "Ogre". Leaving a trail of smashed skulls in my wake, I showed everyone I don't just look like a beast... I am one.

Id: [0x000F55F4]
Whoever called you ugly was off... way off.

Id: [0x000F55F6]
I'd love to know how many of those smashed skulls were pried off of fools who insulted your looks.

Id: [0x000F55F9]
[laughs]Yes, I had heard that people had taken to calling me The Black Lion. It all started with a story that I had chewed the nose off a soldier holding me captive. [beat]All rumors, of course.

Id: [0x000F55FD]
I'll keep out of your affairs, then. I like my face the way it is.

Id: [0x000F55FF]
If you get hungry, don't get any ideas about my nose. I can handle myself with more skill than your average soldier.

Id: [0x000F5602]
Bringer of Hades is a title I earn each day my men and I go into battle. We keep the underworld well stocked with fresh souls peeled from our enemies' corpses on the battlefield.

Id: [0x000F5606]
I look forward to being on your side of the fight.

Id: [0x000F5608]
That's quite a... vivid description.

Id: [0x000F560B]
Anyone who has seen my men in battle knows why villagers call me the Demon King. My men have waded through bloodshed, watched the souls of those they'd call brothers rise to the gods. Yet they carry on. Can you say you'd do the same?

Id: [0x000F560F]
Well, I can't promise I won't bleed if an arrow hits me but that rarely happens.

Id: [0x000F5611]
I am Kassandra, marked by Zeus and descent of the gods. Nothing can take me down in battle.

Id: [0x000F5614]
Selene, Hecate and Artemis came to me in a dream years ago. They promised to name me their king and promised my plunder during moonlight hours would be rewarded with riches. So far, they've stayed true to their word.

Id: [0x000F5618]
Well, I can't argue against advice that gets results.

Id: [0x000F561A]
In a dream not too long ago, I was a hydra that vomited drachmae. Turns out it was something I ate a few hours before.

Id: [0x000F561D]
I am known as the Son of Kings. My birthright is the truest inheritance to ruling the Greek world. Most importantly, my dedicated followers and I won't stop fighting until we've reclaimed it.

Id: [0x000F5621]
Then it's an honor to meet you.

Id: [0x000F5623]
Which king did you say was your father?

Id: [0x000F5626]
I am but a humble servant of Athena... With the greatest army in the Greek world at my command, of course. I carry an olive branch with me so that the great goddess may always guide me in wisdom and war.

Id: [0x000F562A]
Agreed. A battleplan that's not well thought costs lives. More leaders should use wisdom in war.

Id: [0x000F562C]
I'd feel safer following Ares into battle. War is a contest of strength. And strong fighters can charge wise planners with ease.

Id: [0x000F562F]
Everybody who's anybody knows me as the Symposiarch. There's no celebration I can't attend, no invite I can't snag. Those who scoff at my socializing as trivial are fools. Wars are fought and won over shared bread and cups of wine.

Id: [0x000F5633]
Though I don't personally have the stomach for it, I agree that someone needs to play the politics behind closed doors.

Id: [0x000F5635]
Wars are hard won by soldiers and bloodshed on the battlefield. Not through spineless politicians lounging around at feasts and celebrations.

Id: [0x000F5638]
They call me the Centaur's Servant but truly, I serve the forests and all life contained within them. Men forget that the wilderness of Greece was given to us by the gods so that we could live alongside it, not conquer it. I exist to remind those men not to be so arrogant.

Id: [0x000F563C]
Someone needs to speak for the creatures who can't.

Id: [0x000F563E]
With all its beasts and creatures, nature fights back on its own. Seems a bit presumptuous to say you're defending it.

Id: [0x000F5641]
I serve Hephaestus and in turn, he blessed my forge. My craftsmanship of weapons is unrivaled in all of Greece; it's how I began to make my fortune. Cleaving down other leaders and taking their riches? Well, that's how I'll finish it.

Id: [0x000F5645]
Why sell the swords if they can cut a faster path to fortune?

Id: [0x000F5647]
You always need to keep your blade sharp if you're going to cut corners like that.

Id: [0x000F564A]
I was born twice in my life. Once, coming out my mother's womb all bloodied and purpled. Then a second time, coming out of fight clubs, still bloodied and purpled. That time, I wasn't born feeble.

Id: [0x000F564E]
Pain changes you in ways you'd never expect.

Id: [0x000F5650]
We've all been through pain. It's nothing remarkable like birth.

Id: [0x000F5653]
As an art lover in a family of warriors who only ever saw me as soft, I found ways to survive. Playing them off of each other... Well, let's just say I was the black sheep in my family... until I became the only sheep in my family.

Id: [0x000F5657]
Sometimes, the families we're born into weren't the ones we were meant for.

Id: [0x000F5659]
I could never betray my family like that.

Id: [0x000F565C]
If there's one thing I've learned, <i>misthios</i>, it's that once the slightest amount of wealth falls into your lap, even your truest friends will coming begging for loans. I prefer to stay rich and lonely. What about you?

Id: [0x000F5660]
If my friend were in need, drachmae is hardly what's important.

Id: [0x000F5662]
I doubt friends who come begging for loans are really your friends in the first place.

Id: [0x000F56C5]
What I'm asking for isn't easy but you look like you can handle a challenge. I need you to go into enemy territory and weaken them anyway you can. Target their military, their economy - anything you can do helps.

Id: [0x000F56C7]
My forces are making great strides on the home front but I want to be one step ahead of our enemy. Go into their territory and weaken them.

Id: [0x000F56C9]
If we ever hope to gain more ground, we need to hit our enemy on their home front. Cross their borders and weaken them anyway you can.

Id: [0x000F56CB]

It's time to get aggressive. I need you to cross hostile borders and start taking out their soldiers.

Id: [0x000F56D9]
Our enemy is weakening. It's time to strike. Cross hostile borders and kill any soldiers you find.

Id: [0x000F56DB]
We need to stop skirmishing with our enemy and hit them hard. Go into hostile territory and kill their soldiers.

Id: [0x000F56DD]
Our forces are being hit hard by specialized agents from our enemies. I need you to cross enemy territory and take them out before they cut down my men on the battlefield.

Id: [0x000F56DF]
Our enemy has been training special agents that could seriously cripple us if they ever set foot on the battlefield. Track them down and kill them before that happens.

Id: [0x000F56E1]
We've got our enemies on the run and they know it. They're training highly specialized agents to compensate. Take them out before these agents tip the scales.

Id: [0x000F56E3]
We've been skirmishing with enemy soldiers for weeks now but enough is enough. We need to get aggressive. Cross hostile borders and take out their specialists.

Id: [0x000F56E5]
Hostile forces have highly skilled killers training for battle as we speak. I need you to go into enemy territory and take them down before they can shed any of my men's blood.

Id: [0x000F56E7]
One of our allies helped us out of a tough spot recently and now it's time to repay them. Go, do whatever you can to bolster their resources.

Id: [0x000F56E9]
Our allies need help regrouping after a recent ambush. Go into their territory and strengthen them however you can.

Id: [0x000F56EB]
It's time to return a favor. An allied nation has been losing ground lately in the war. Cross their borders and strengthen them. Bolster their resources, take out threats to their civilians - anything you can do helps.

We need to keep trade with allies open but bandit ships have been attacking their boats. Destroy the raiders' ships to reopen trade.

Id: [0x000F56F5]
One of our allies has a bandit problem on their hands. Their boats are being brought down by raiders before they can make it a mile out of port. I need those raider ships destroyed.

Id: [0x000F56F7]
Our allies' ships are being ravaged by raiders. I need you to take care of these leeches. Destroy their boats.

Id: [0x000F56F9]
I don't have anything for you here right now but civilians in an allied nation could really use a hand. Head there and complete some jobs from their contract board.

Id: [0x000F56FB]
Our allies' forces are spread thin right now between defending their borders and warding off bandits. Pick up some jobs off their contract board to help them out with day to day tasks.

Id: [0x000F56FD]

Allied communities nearby are having trouble with beasts infesting the area. I need you to hunt them down so the communities can concentrate on war efforts.

Id: [0x000F5713]
Our allies are having trouble with truly savage beasts who've acquired the taste for human flesh. I need you to hunt them down and show them who's top of the food chain.

Id: [0x000F5715]
Beasts have been absolutely devastating civilians in an allied state as of late. It's time for you to go hunting.

We will never get anywhere in this damn war if we don't take risks so that's what I need you to do. Find and kill our enemies' leaders.

We've been gaining headway against hostile forces as of late but we need to move faster. Take out their leaders to cripple them irreparably.

Id: [0x000F5723]
I've received word that enemy forces are sailing specialized warships that could cut through our defenses by sea. I need you to take them out before that happens.

Id: [0x000F5725]
Carving a path by sea is essential for  victory. But our enemies have specialized ships we just can't compete with. Destroy these boats. Make sure there's nothing left.

Id: [0x000F5727]
Our forces are making a lot of headway by sea, but we could really use some backup. Take out our enemies' specialized ships.

We've had a bit of a beast problem lately. Animals are getting too brave and wandering into populated areas. Hunt them down before they hurt anyone.

Id: [0x000F578B]
There's an increase in the population of bloodthirsty beasts as of late and it's putting me on edge. Go hunting.

Id: [0x000F578D]
A few beasts have been dining on my civilians a little too often as of late. Make sure you kill them all.

Id: [0x000F578F]
I need that job done soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000F5791]
The gods will thank you for getting this done, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000F5793]
Time is drachmae and you're wasting it. Finish the contract, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000F5795]
The job I gave you is of national importance, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000F5796]
Back again? Good, I have more work for you.

Id: [0x000F5797]
Finally! You're back. There's more to be done around here, you know.

Id: [0x000F5798]
Oh, it's you again. I may have something for you.

Id: [0x000F5799]
Good, you're back. We need more ready blades around here.

Id: [0x000F579A]
Back for more? I hope you brought a sharp blade.

Id: [0x000F579B]
Glad the gods sent you back our way. We could use a mercenary about now.

Id: [0x000F579C]
Ah, you're back. There's more divine work for you here, if you're interested.

Id: [0x000F579D]
Ah, I had a feeling you'd be back. Ready to get to work?

Id: [0x000F579E]
By the gods, it's good you're back. We need more ready swords around here.

Id: [0x000F579F]
Oh good, the gods sent you back to us. We could use your help.

Id: [0x000F57A0]
Oh, you're back. Good. There's more that needs plundering, you know.

Id: [0x000F57A1]
Ah, you again. Ready to earn some drachmae?

Id: [0x000F57A2]
Oh, it's you. There's more drachmae to be made here, if you're interested.

Id: [0x000F57A3]
Well, well. You're back. If it's opportunity you seek, there's plenty here.

Id: [0x000F57A4]
Back for more? I might have something for you.

Id: [0x000F57A5]
Ah. You again. Ready to serve?

Id: [0x000F57A6]
Back again, I see. There's lots for you to do here. We are trying to change the world, after all.

Id: [0x000F57A7]
Good to see you back. The Greek world awaits your service.

Id: [0x000F57A8]
Ah, I knew you'd be back. There's more work for you, if you'd like.

Id: [0x000F57A9]
Back so soon? And ready to serve the world once more, I hope?

Id: [0x000F57AA]
If it isn't my favorite <i>misthios</i>. Ready to strike fear into the hearts of our enemies?

Id: [0x000F57AB]
Well, well. The mighty warrior returns. And with a sharp blade, I hope?

Id: [0x000F57AC]
Ah, Eagle Bearer! You're just in time. I have more work for you.

Id: [0x000F57AD]
By Zeus, I've been awaiting your return. We could use your help.

Id: [0x000F57AE]
Ah, good. The gods sent you back to us. And just in time.

Id: [0x000F57AF]
Oh good, the Messenger of Zeus has returned to us. We've got more work for you, if you're interested.

Id: [0x000F57B0]
Well, well. My favorite opportunist is back. And just in time for more work.

Id: [0x000F57B1]
Eagle Bearer! There's always drachmae for you here if you're up for a little challenge.

Id: [0x000F57B2]
If it isn't my favorite business partner. Ready to turn another profit together?

Id: [0x000F57B3]
If it isn't the most influential <i>misthios</i> in the Greek world. There's more work to be done around here if you're interested.

Id: [0x000F57B4]
<i>Chaire</i>, friend. We've been missing your company, as of late. Ready to get back to work?

Id: [0x000F57B5]
It's good to have our strongest ally back once more. Ready to serve?

Id: [0x000F57B6]
If war is won by brutes, then let us be brutes.

Id: [0x000F57B8]
In all matters, let our spears negotiate the details.

Id: [0x000F57BA]
We will meet our enemies again in Hades.

Id: [0x000F57BC]
Fight like the hounds of Hell are behind you.

Id: [0x000F57BD]
And they shall be.

Id: [0x000F57BE]
Tonight we offer the bodies of our enemies as sacrifice.

Id: [0x000F57C0]
Truth and lies are close accomplices.

Id: [0x000F57C2]
Athena grant us victory.

Id: [0x000F57C4]
A shared feast can turn any enemy into a friend.

Id: [0x000F57C6]
A single shepherd feeds more mouths than ten butchers.

Id: [0x000F57C8]
No sword can cleave a strong alliance.

Id: [0x000F57CA]
There is no victory without suffering.

Id: [0x000F57CC]
For planning. For patience.

Id: [0x000F57CD]
For prudence.

Id: [0x000F57CE]
We shall take and take.

Id: [0x000F57CF]
And take again.

Id: [0x000F57D4]
Come back when you've made a name for yourself, misthios.

Id: [0x000F57D6]
I'm not interested in small-time mercenaries.

Id: [0x000F57D8]
Can't you see I'm too busy for the likes of you?

Id: [0x000F57D9]
I hear you've made quite a name for yourself, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F57DD]
The Eagle Bearer... I've heard a lot about you.

Id: [0x000F57E3]
Aren't you the one they call Eagle Bearer? I've heard stories.

Id: [0x000F57E6]
A misthios with a broken spear, just like they said... I've heard a lot about you.

Id: [0x000F57EA]
Hmph, the infamous misthios finally arrives. You know, there's a lot of stories about you.

Id: [0x000F57F0]
And here comes the mighty misthios. My men have been whispering about you.

Id: [0x000F57F3]
They call you the Eagle Bearer... among other things.

Id: [0x000F57F7]
From all the stories I've heard, I thought you'd be taller, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F57FD]
There's plenty of rumors swirling around about you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F5803]
I've heard some strange tales about you, misthios.

Id: [0x000F5806]
Khaire[Hello], misthios. It's good to finally meet you.

Id: [0x000F5807]
Eagle Bearer. I had a feeling you'd come by. I'm glad to finally meet you.

Id: [0x000F5808]
The Messenger of Zeus. I was wondering when you'd find me. It's good to make your acquaintance.

Id: [0x000F5809]
Eagle Bearer, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

Id: [0x000F580A]
Ah, the great Messenger of Zeus I've heard so much about. It's nice to finally meet you.

Id: [0x000F580B]
Messenger of Zeus... I've been wondering when I'd have the pleasure of making your acquaintance.

Id: [0x000F580C]
Khaire[Greetings]. I've looked forward to meeting you for a long time, misthios.

Id: [0x000F580D]
I had a feeling our paths would cross soon. It's a pleasure to meet you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F580E]
Khaire[Greetings]. It's nice to finally meet you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F580F]
I'm glad fate has brought us together, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F5810]
Well, well. I've heard grand tales about you, misthios. I think we'd make good partners.

Id: [0x000F5811]
The mighty misthios! I've been... intrigued at the thought of working with you.

Id: [0x000F5812]
The warrior with the broken spear has finally found me. I wonder... would we make good business partners?

Id: [0x000F5813]
You're quite the subject of discussion, misthios. Glad we finally get to talk... and maybe even work together.

Id: [0x000F5814]
A lot of rumors have been swirling about you, Eagle Bearer. But don't worry, I am really only interested in your future... as a potential partner.

Id: [0x000F5815]
You've had my attention for a while now, misthios. You seem like someone who would know a good opportunity when they see one.

Id: [0x000F5816]
Khaire[Greetings], Eagle Bearer... I was skeptical of your reputation at first... but you seem clever enough. I might be willing to work with you.

Id: [0x000F5817]
Khaire[Greetings], misthios. You know, I've been asking around about you. Can't be too cautious when considering a potential ally.

Id: [0x000F5818]
The mighty misthios with the bird of Zeus. You know, I've been considering working with you for some time now...

Id: [0x000F5819]
The mighty misthios with the broken spear... We finally meet. I've had my eye on you for a while now as a potential partner.

Id: [0x000F581A]
Khaire[Greetings], Eagle Bearer. Whispers in my inner circles say you're someone worth meeting.

Id: [0x000F581B]
Khaire[Greetings], Eagle Bearer. My advisors have told me a great deal about you.

Id: [0x000F581C]
So you're the mighty misthios everyone's been talking about? Pleasure to meet you.

Id: [0x000F581D]
Eagle Bearer, you're all anyone around here can speak of. I've been looking forward to meeting you.

Id: [0x000F581E]
It seems you're quite influential for a misthios, Eagle Bearer. My advisors have been briefing me on your... adventures.

Id: [0x000F581F]
If it isn't the mysterious Eagle Bearer. It seems everyone is singing your praises these days.

Id: [0x000F5820]
My advisors seem to think you are a valuable friend to have. We'll see about that.

Id: [0x000F5821]
Aren't you quite the enigma? I've been trying to piece together just what it is that makes you so memorable.

Id: [0x000F5822]
Khaire[Greetings], misthios. I've been told to watch for you.

Id: [0x000F5823]
Ah, the Eagle Bearer. You're all anyone here can talk about, it seems.

Id: [0x000F5825]
The villagers call me the General of Ghouls, for my army never tires and fights as though it's been to Hades and back. My men don't fear death as mortals like you should.

Id: [0x000F5829]
A healthy urge to survive has brought me this far. I think I'll hang on to it.

Id: [0x000F582B]
Seems to me you're the mortal, general. I am Kassandra, descendent of the gods.

Id: [0x000F582E]
Come bearing an eagle, do you? Slayers of Zeus should never be bound to mere mortals. Ten years I spent in a Persian prison - submitting to captors far inferior than I was a fate worse than death. Your bird suffers as I did, and I'm not sure I can allow it.

Id: [0x000F5832]
Ikaros chooses to travel with me of his own free will.

Id: [0x000F5834]
My friendship with Ikaros does not concern you.

Id: [0x000F5837]
[Growls] Bear Clawed is a title I earned, misthios, prying the paws off an unlucky beast that attacked me while I was on patrol. [Laughs ferociously]

Id: [0x000F583B]
Whoever came up with your nickname must've had quite the imagination.

Id: [0x000F583D]
I don't envy the bear wandering around without claws right now.

Id: [0x000F5840]
Many years ago, I was a priest pledged to Artemis's temple... until savage raiders killed everyone in it and destroyed my sacred home. I alone survived and vowed to curse those who would desecrate my goddess's revered grounds to dwelling on the moon for eternity.

Id: [0x000F5844]
Artemis is fortunate to have such a devoted servant.

Id: [0x000F5846]
I'm not interested in myths.

Id: [0x000F5849]
Though they call me the Fearless Shark, I'm still just a trireme rower at heart serving the mighty Poseidon. But when you get real good at, ah, disemboweling pirates, accolades come pouring in. [beat, conspiratorially]I like pulling out pirate livers. I really do.

Id: [0x000F584D]
Gutting pirates is a hobby of mine, too.

Id: [0x000F584F]
I suppose if you intend to make the sea safer for sailors, we share a common goal.

Id: [0x000F5852]
Hmph, my men and I fight only for what is true and just, so much so that some even call me the Protector of Truth. I would never fight for drachmae like a common hireling.

Id: [0x000F5856]
I am Kassandra, descended of gods and marked by Zeus himself. The work I do is far from common.

Id: [0x000F5858]
Right. I can fight for truth... if the price is right.

Id: [0x000F585B]
My men call me the Guided Javelin because I can strike more precisely from a distance with my spear than any archer can with a bow. In the mood to test your flimsy arrows against my mighty spear? [laughs]

Id: [0x000F585F]
Let's test your throwing arm another time. Then you can keep your nickname a little while longer.

Id: [0x000F5861]
Arrows are only flimsy in artless hands. Your javelin is no match for the arrows of an archer as skilled as myself.

Id: [0x000F5864]
Well, whether they're trying to wound me or praise me with the title Thieving Snake is irrelevant. I'm the stealthiest thief in all the land. There's no treasure I can't get my hands on, no guard I can't slip past. Who needs public opinion when you have wealth?

Id: [0x000F5868]
Public opinion is easily bought, at any rate.

Id: [0x000F586A]
As long as you can lie comfortably in the bed you make, I suppose.

Id: [0x000F586D]
Of course, misthios. As Pitmaster, I have learned that cruelty can be a kindness. My own taskmaster was barbaric to me. It made me stronger until one day, I overpowered him. No doubt my... unorthodox ways are producing a revolutionary in my mines who may very well overtake me... But such is the circle of life.

Id: [0x000F5871]
Strength is born, not made. Exploitation has nothing to do with it.

Id: [0x000F5873]
Cruelty is never justified.

Id: [0x000F5876]
Let me tell you my story. From a young age, I was exiled for my callous parents' impiety. Though I cannot exorcize their impurity from my veins, I cleanse myself every day through godly deeds and devotion in hope that I may someday be worthy of returning home.

Id: [0x000F587A]
I was also forced to leave my home at a young age. I know how difficult life is on your own.

Id: [0x000F587C]
A home that would turn you out on your own was never truly your home in the first place.

Id: [0x000F587F]
Let me tell you about myself. I went into war, hoping to find great wealth, but when I got there, all I saw was waste... Wasted lives, and more importantly, wasted money. Now I lobby our leaders out of battle and into the profits that come with peace.

Id: [0x000F5883]
It's noble to work towards peace... Even if the end goal is wealth.

Id: [0x000F5885]
Peace or no peace, you're still only looking out for yourself.

Id: [0x000F5888]
Of course, my dear misthios. You know better than anyone that this life gives nothing for free. My personal motto is if one desires wealth... well, one must be willing to take it. Interested in dying a rich old fool?

Id: [0x000F588C]
I charge for my services as a <i>misthios</i> to get by, but I have other concerns beyond great riches.

Id: [0x000F58FA]
The neighbors along our borders aren't exactly friendly, and they're becoming more powerful than I'd like. You must find a way to weaken their resources.

Id: [0x000F58FC]
The threat of invasion at our borders is very real, and enemy states grow stronger every day. You need to weaken their resources at all costs.

Id: [0x000F58FE]
My men have been thrusting back along our borders, and it's paying off. Our enemy is weakening and won't last much longer. Attack their resources any way you can so we can make our final push.

Id: [0x000F5900]
TBD: My forces are stretched. With the threat of invasion, every sword is guarding at the border, leaving no one to protect the citizens. Now I got a bandit problem on my hands. Kill every raider and bandit you find.

Id: [0x000F590C]
We need to start taking risks if we're going to gain more ground. Go into enemy territory and start taking out their soldiers.

Id: [0x000F590E]
Enemy factions have been growing stronger as of late, but my men need to stay focused on our borders. Take out any hostiles you can to stunt their growth.

Id: [0x000F5910]
To gain an edge on our enemies, we need to be more aggressive. I need you to cross hostile borders and target their militaries.

Id: [0x000F5912]
Our enemies have highly specialized agents working for them. If you find yourself up against an enemy faction, target these specialists and you'll be rewarded.

Id: [0x000F5914]
Specialized enemy agents have honed in on our weak points and hit us where it hurts. Kill these agents before they're able to cripple us further.

Id: [0x000F5916]
Our enemies have specialized agents better than our own. These trained killers know exactly where to strike to cripple us for weeks. Send them to the ferryman.

Id: [0x000F5918]
We really need to gain some ground on our enemies. But they have trained soldiers with a... precise skill set. Take them out quickly before they shed any more of our blood.

Id: [0x000F591A]
To keep gaining ground against our enemies, we need to strike more precisely. They have specialized agents that must be dealt with. Find them and kill them.

Id: [0x000F591C]
An allied state could use some help after a recent attack. Bolster their resources to get them back on their feet.

Id: [0x000F591E]
We need to return a favor to a nearby ally who helped us out of a tough spot recently. Strengthen them by shoring up their resources.

Id: [0x000F5920]
It's time we curry favor with one of our neighbors. Help strengthen our allies by boosting their resources.

Id: [0x000F5922]

Id: [0x000F5928]
Our allies are trying to carve a trade route by sea, but bandit ships stand in their way. Take out those ships so they can clear a path.

Id: [0x000F592A]
Several shipments belonging to nearby allies have been getting "lost" at sea. I suspect raiders. Take out any bandit ships you can find.

Id: [0x000F592C]
Our allies don't have the sturdiest ships, and they're being attacked by bandits. Help them by taking out the raider ships targeting them.

Id: [0x000F592E]
There's not much going on at the moment, but there's lots of work to be done in our allied communities. You can pick up jobs from their contract board to help them out.

Id: [0x000F5930]
One of our allies is in a bind. They've had to call on all their men to defend their borders and are short on mercenaries as a result. Pick up some jobs from their contract board to help them out.

Id: [0x000F5932]
We've been doing all right on our own as of late, so I'm afraid I can't offer you work... But I would appreciate you helping out our allies. Pick up work from their contract boards, and I'll reward you for it.

One of our allies is having trouble with beasts that have acquired a taste for civilian blood. Time for you to go hunting.

Id: [0x000F5948]
A neighboring ally needs skilled hunters to take out the predators that have been attacking their civilians. Kill any beasts you can find.

Id: [0x000F594A]
Wild beasts have been plaguing civilians in one of our allied states. Kill those animals to help them stay safe.

Id: [0x000F594C]
Our forces have skilled fighters, but when it comes to sheer numbers, our enemies have got us beat. It's time to even the odds: take out enemy soldiers wherever you can.

Id: [0x000F594E]
Enemy forces have been decimating our soldiers. Kill them off before they shed any more of our blood.

Id: [0x000F5950]
Our enemies fight dirty and without honor. Kill them swiftly, and we will all be in your debt.

Id: [0x000F5952]
Hostile forces are organizing quickly. We need a trained killer to strike with precision. Target their leaders to leave them in disarray.

Id: [0x000F5954]
We've had a few skirmishes with enemy forces recently. Nothing we can't handle, but we could save a lot of time by cutting them off at the source: kill their leaders.

Id: [0x000F5956]
What's a snake without its head? Dead. The same goes for a military without its leader. Kill the leaders of our enemies, and their soldiers will be writhing uselessly in no time.

Id: [0x000F5958]
Our forces are leading the fight on the ground, but we can't make any headway by sea. Hostile forces have some finely crafted ships that we just can't sink fast enough. Take out as many of them as you can find.

Id: [0x000F595A]
I heard a rumor that hostile naval leaders sail on a special type of ship. Target those boats and see if we can't put a dent in their naval command structure.

Id: [0x000F595C]
We need to make a bigger push by sea, but our enemy has some sturdy ships blocking our path. I need them destroyed. In fact, make sure there's nothing left of them.

Id: [0x000F595E]
We can't ever hope to gain the ground we need on land if we don't carve out a path by sea. Our enemies have some finely crafted ships standing in our way. Destroy them.

Id: [0x000F5960]
If we ever hope to demolish our enemies by sea, we must take out their best ships - they give them an edge that I can't hope to match. Destroy them.

Id: [0x000F5962]
Enemies on specialized ships have been striking us precisely where it hurts most, and it's time to return the favor. Target these ships and make sure nothing's left of them.

Id: [0x000F5964]
Our naval forces could really use some backup - they've been spread pretty thin as of late. Take to the seas and destroy our enemies' boats.

Id: [0x000F5966]
My men have all but won the battle on land, but the sea is another matter entirely. Assist our naval forces and destroy the enemy's ships.

Id: [0x000F5968]
The horizon is lined with a few too many enemy ships. Provide backup by destroying as many of them as you can.

Id: [0x000F596A]
TBD: My forces are stretched. With the threat of invasion, every sword is guarding at the border, leaving no one to protect the citizens. Now I got a bandit problem on my hands. Kill every raider and bandit you find.

Our forces have been making headway, and it's time for the final push. Fight by their sides in the coming battle and bolster them any way you can.

Id: [0x000F5972]
Our allies are making small gains, but they could use some specialized help. Reinforce them on the battlefield.

Id: [0x000F5974]
Our allies have been fighting bravely on the battlefield, and it's gotten us far. But I'm not about to turn down backup... Join them in our upcoming fight.

Id: [0x000F597C]
Special operatives on the enemy side seem to be the driving force within their militaries. Take them out quickly to force them to regroup.

Id: [0x000F597E]
My men can take down regular soldiers without issue, but our enemies seemed to have mobilized a specially trained group of killers. Send them to Hades as soon as possible.

Id: [0x000F5980]
I've just received word that our enemies are training highly skilled agents who will cut through our upper ranks on the battlefield. Take them out before they get the chance.

Id: [0x000F5982]
Our enemy has been gaining strength as of late. I need you to strike with precision and cut down their best soldiers.

Id: [0x000F5984]
My forces and I are preparing for the battle ahead. In the meantime, though, our enemies have been sending highly trained soldiers to poke holes in our chain of command. Take out them out.

Id: [0x000F5986]
We are stronger than our enemy in almost every element except one: the element of surprise. Highly trained hostile soldiers have been ambushing our best. Kill them.

Id: [0x000F5988]
Our enemies have been stockpiling key resources like food in crates. Destroy them so we can starve them out.

Id: [0x000F598A]
We've noticed our enemies stockpiling resources of some kind, and we have reason to believe it may be weapons that could seriously weaken our efforts. Destroy these caches at all costs.

Id: [0x000F598C]
Our allies need every advantage. Hostile forces are storing war supplies in crates. Destroy them.

Id: [0x000F5994]
The strength of our military means nothing if our resources are inadequate. My forces need more support: bolster our defenses.

Id: [0x000F5996]
Now more than ever, we need support: helping civilians, killing bandits, or bolstering our trade - anything you can do helps.

Id: [0x000F5998]
We could really use your support here. Improve trade, take out bandits, or help civilians - whatever you can take on will strengthen our efforts.

Id: [0x000F59A0]
My forces need to be entirely focused on combatting the threat of invasion. Criminals have ben taking advantage of this distraction to attack civilians. Eliminate all the raiders and bandits nearby.

Id: [0x000F59A2]
Bloody raiders have been ravaging the area while my men are fighting at the borders. Hunt down every leeching bandit in the area.

Id: [0x000F59A4]
My men are preoccupied with the threats to our borders and leaving civilians unprotected. Criminals can smell vulnerability. Find and kill every raider and bandit you can.

Id: [0x000F59A6]
There's lots of work to be done in the area. Take a few jobs from the contract board to help out civilians nearby.

Id: [0x000F59A8]
Not a lot of mercenaries have been coming through here as of late, so our civilians are in need of hired help. Complete a few jobs on our contract board, then come see me.

Id: [0x000F59AA]
My men's time is in scarce supply with the enemy at our borders. This means there's more work to be done than ever. Go have a look at the contract board and pick up a job or two.

Id: [0x000F59BE]
There must be something in the waters around here... Beasts have been absolutely ravaging our civilians. Take out any you can to minimize the casualties.

Id: [0x000F59C0]
Something strange is going on - wild beasts that never bothered civilians much before have been out for blood lately. Kill them before we lose any more people.

Id: [0x000F59C2]
It puts me on edge to not be the alpha predator in the area. Hunt down the creatures who have been spilling too much blood lately.

Id: [0x000F59C4]
I gave you a job. Now do it.

Id: [0x000F59C6]
The sooner you get the job done, the better.

Id: [0x000F59C8]
Don't let me down, misthios.

Id: [0x000F59CA]
I really need that contract done, misthios.

Id: [0x000F59CB]
Hm, back already? I might have something for you.

Id: [0x000F59CC]
Oh good, you're back. I have more work for you.

Id: [0x000F59CD]
You're just in time. We've got more work for you.

Ah, thank the gods you're back. We've got more work for you.

Id: [0x000F59D4]

Id: [0x000F59D5]
Ah, looking to make more drachmae?

Id: [0x000F59D6]
There's more drachmae to be made here if you're willing to take on another job.

Id: [0x000F59D7]
Ready for more? I can make it worth your while.

Id: [0x000F59D8]
There's more profit to be gained here, misthios, if you're ready for more work.

Id: [0x000F59D9]
Back again? I've got more work for you, if you're interested.

Id: [0x000F59DA]

Id: [0x000F59DC]
Ready to serve?

The threats to our fair land will never rest, and neither can we. I've got more work for you, if you're ready.

Id: [0x000F59DE]
There's lots to do, misthios, if you're interested in getting back to work.

Id: [0x000F59DF]
Ah, the mighty misthios returns! And just in time. I have more work for you.

Id: [0x000F59E0]
Khaire[hello], mighty warrior! Back for more work, I hope?

Id: [0x000F59E1]
Eagle Bearer! It's always good to see you... And put you to work.

Id: [0x000F59E2]
A visit from the Messenger of Zeus is always a blessing. There's more to be done around here, of course.

Id: [0x000F59E3]
Thank the gods! The mighty misthios is back. And at just the right time.

Id: [0x000F59E4]
Ma dia[By Zeus], you're back! And just when we need you most.

Id: [0x000F59E5]
If it isn't my favorite business partner. Come to earn more drachmae?

Id: [0x000F59E6]
Good to see you, misthios. It's been too long since we turned a profit together.

Id: [0x000F59E7]
Looking forward to seeing what fortunes lie in store for us, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000F59E8]
If it isn't my favorite revolutionary. I've got more work, if you're interested.

Id: [0x000F59E9]
Back then, Eagle Bearer? We could really use an ally of your caliber.

Id: [0x000F59EA]
Ah, Eagle Bearer. Your presence is an honor I am grateful to receive. And of course, we can always offer you more work.

Id: [0x000F59EB]
Above all others, we follow Death's orders.

Id: [0x000F59ED]
To the throats of our greatest enemies, we offer the edge of our dullest blades.

Id: [0x000F59EF]

Poseidon will rise again.

Id: [0x000F59F4]

Have you returned to help find my missing vase?

Id: [0x000F60BA]
I'm busy. Go speak with my slave regarding my stolen vase.

Id: [0x000F60CA]
Speak with my slave near the warehouses. I sent him to uncover what he could from other slaves in the area. Hopefully he's learned something by now.

Id: [0x000F60CB]
I'll return if I find the vase.

Id: [0x000F60CD]
It's your vase. You'll have to find it yourself.

Id: [0x000F60D0]
I'm hoping that after you retrieve the vase, you'll tell my master that I told the bandits to loot the house.

Id: [0x000F60D1]
Why would you want to do that?

Id: [0x000F60D2]
After the summer solstice, my master plans to give me my freedom. But I don't want it.

Id: [0x000F60D4]
I'm hoping that if I take partial blame for the crime, I can offer my continued servitude as atonement.

Id: [0x000F60D5]
I understand. But what I need from you isn't a labor or an action, it's a commitment.

Id: [0x000F60D7]
I have a working agreement with your master. We're all on the same side, so tell me what you need.

Id: [0x000F60D8]
You're a rose amongst the weeds.

Id: [0x000F60D9]
The slaves mentioned there's a copper mine in the area. That's where I'd put my hideout if I was a bandit.

Id: [0x000F6161]
There must be information at the house that will lead us to the Cult's sympathizers. Keep looking.

Id: [0x000F616B]
Thank the Fates! You must be the mercenary my sister sent. I'm Diona, a priestess of the Temple.

Id: [0x000F616C]
Well met. Is this the group's hideout?

Id: [0x000F616E]
Thank the Fates! When the High Priestess said to expect a mercenary, I hoped it was you. I'm glad you are with us.

Id: [0x000F616F]
Well met again, Diona, but don't misunderstand. For now our paths align, but I am not with anybody.

Id: [0x000F6170]
Where is the group's hideout?

Id: [0x000F6172]
The first is nearby - that building just to the south. I can't be seen to be involved, which is why I can't come with you.

Id: [0x000F6173]
Go in quietly and look around. If you find anything, come back to me.

Id: [0x000F6174]
Remember, you are dealing with the Cult. Be careful!

Id: [0x000F617A]
It's been a long time since I took care over anything. There's no-one on this island who can challenge me.

Id: [0x000F617C]
Yes, you are probably right. I won't do anything foolish.

Id: [0x000F617E]
I found some colored powder, a map with a location marked on it, and a letter mentioning a meeting.

Id: [0x000F617F]
That's signal powder! It creates colored smoke when burned. As for the map… I think I know that location. It's a cove to the north, but there's nothing there that I know of.

Id: [0x000F6185]
We should go to the location on the map.

Id: [0x000F6186]
It's worth a try.

Id: [0x000F6189]
Maybe if we go to the location on the map and used the signaling powder something will happen.

Id: [0x000F618A]
It's worth a try.

Id: [0x000F618D]
I think they have a signaling system. My guess is they used the powder at the location marked on the map to message each other.

Id: [0x000F618E]
Clever. That explains why we've been unable to catch them.

Id: [0x000F6191]
Go to the cove. I'll meet you there. Remember, anyone there must be working with the Cult.

Id: [0x000F6192]
Show them no mercy. They will give you none.

Id: [0x000F619F]
It's so nice and sunny outside!

Id: [0x000F61A1]
It's so nice and sunny outside!

Id: [0x000F61A2]

Ugh!! The food went bad!!

Id: [0x000F6576]
Oh! The food went bad!

Id: [0x000F6591]
If Nikolaos is your father, I guess that makes you my brother.

Id: [0x000F6592]
Did you take a blow to the head during battle? What are you talking about?

Id: [0x000F6593]
The Wolf is my father as well as yours.

Id: [0x000F6594]
Ridiculous! Before he adopted me into his home he had two children, and they both died in Sparta many years ago.

Id: [0x000F6595]
Except for the one standing before you now.

Id: [0x000F6596]
You almost fooled me, but I wasn't born yesterday, misthios. Let's stick to the subject of why you're here.

Id: [0x000F6598]
You can't be his son. I heard his children died in Sparta many years ago.

Id: [0x000F6599]
He adopted me into his household after his previous family failed him. I would never bring dishonor to him.

Id: [0x000F659A]
Sometimes things happen in a way that you don't plan or expect. History has a way of remembering things strangely.

Id: [0x000F659B]
You talk as if you were there.

Id: [0x000F659C]
Maybe I was.

Id: [0x000F659D]
Nonsense. You're too young to have witnessed such things. But enough of the past, let's discuss the future.

Id: [0x000F659F]
The fleet might be destroyed, but Megaris is firmly in Athenian control. We need to weaken their position if we are to take to the field and drive them back to Athens.

Id: [0x000F65AB]
Why do you need a mercenary to do that? You seem to have plenty of soldiers at your disposal.

Id: [0x000F65AC]
It's not a question of manpower. The Megarians are our allies. We do not want to commit troops until we know victory is assured. My scouts are already locating key targets that we can hit.

Id: [0x000F65AD]
And once I’ve brought the Athenians to their knees for Sparta, I'll get that meeting with Nikolaos. Or you'll be next.

Id: [0x000F65AE]
Send those Athenian dogs to Hades, misthios. Do this and the Wolf will personally see to it that you are rewarded.

Id: [0x000F6755]
Rich, maybe, but certainly not a fool. I'm more than just a <i>misthios</i>. Leonidas's spear marks me for glory.

Id: [0x000F676E]
Uh oh. Murder or impiety?

Id: [0x000F6770]
Neither!

Id: [0x000F6771]
Too bad. You would have loved life on the sea.

Id: [0x000F6772]
Fine. Maybe we'll meet again... if Poseidon wills it.

Id: [0x000F6773]
You'd have loved Barnabas, [beat]but fine.

Id: [0x000F6774]
You're always welcome aboard if you change your mind.

Id: [0x000F6779]
They're not. Last time I was at the Drogarati Cave, it was full of thieves. It's not a holy place.

Id: [0x000F677B]
No gods? Not one? ...Well, it's settled then. Take my tribute - for your bravery!

Id: [0x000F6ADD]
I have.

Id: [0x000F6AE0]
Oh good! Tell me, did you find it?

Id: [0x000F6AF7]
Well, if money's what she needs, the bandits' stolen loot will do just fine.

Id: [0x000F6AFC]
Just like she said. The cart looks pretty worse-for-wear.

Id: [0x000F6B34]
Looks like these new baskets were off to market - until the cart broke.

Id: [0x000F6B44]
This should help. Better them than the bandits.

Id: [0x000F6BF4]
What's going on?

Id: [0x000F6E06]
<i>You're</i> wandering around on your own.

Id: [0x000F6F68]
There's nothing you can do.

Id: [0x000F6F69]
No!

Id: [0x000F6F6D]
Let them go.

Id: [0x000F6F6E]
What?!

Id: [0x000F6F93]
As much as I cursed this place for what it did to us, it feels more like home than Kephallonia ever did.

Id: [0x000F6FB6]
Sparta is our home. But we'll have to rid ourselves of the puppet king if we are to ever find peace.

Id: [0x000F6FBA]
The closer we get to Sparta, the more memories keep flooding in.

Id: [0x000F6FD4]
Kassandra, wait! You mustn't interfere. This is Spartan training territory.

Id: [0x000F6FFA]
Who are you, again? Please, I'm quite busy.

Id: [0x000F6FFC]
[laughs] You seem to think I have time for someone as lowly as you.

Id: [0x000F6FFE]
I need some reassurance you can get the job done before trusting you, misthios.

Id: [0x000F700B]
If you intervene, I will be forced to defend the gods' wills.

Id: [0x000F7010]
Let's get out of here. Can you fight?

Id: [0x000F7011]
I'd be <i>happy</i> to.

Id: [0x000F70CE]
[&ah]You're right. I can't fight a camp of bandits by myself. Could you help me get to Odysseus's palace[2425521]? I can pay.

Id: [0x000F70E4]
Were you followed?

Id: [0x000F70E5]
No.

Id: [0x000F70EC]
Before you go - take my drachmae. It can't pay for what you gave us<i>, </i>but it's all we have.

Id: [0x000F70F2]
A letter from Lagos? It could have the answers we need.

Id: [0x000F70F3]
I'll follow them. You keep searching the house.

Id: [0x000F7116]
Safe travels.

Id: [0x000F7118]
Why would you want to go up there?

Id: [0x000F7119]
I'm a descendant of Odysseus. I'm on a pilgrimage.

Id: [0x000F711A]
The rumors surrounding you, though... are few and far between.

Id: [0x000F711B]
It seems my reputation precedes me. But I've heard little of yours.

Id: [0x000F711E]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x000F711F]
If there's drachmae to be gained, I'll consider it.

Id: [0x000F7334]
I just don't have time for you right now.

Id: [0x000F7336]
I'm sorry, but I have other matters to attend to.

Id: [0x000F7337]
You're a descendant of the former king of Ithaka?

Id: [0x000F733F]
Come back when you've earned your place in the world.

Id: [0x000F7341]
Come back when you're someone worthy of my time.

Id: [0x000F7343]
Should I know your name? Didn't think so, misthios.

Id: [0x000F7345]
I have more important matters to attend to than small-time mercenaries.

Id: [0x000F7356]
Obviously not.

Id: [0x000F7362]
<i>Mater</i> told me to meet her at the Statue of Artemis in the Cedar.

Id: [0x000F7364]
This is touching, but you owe me drachmae.

Id: [0x000F7368]
Well, I'm in the right place...

Id: [0x000F73A4]
Your reputation precedes you, as well. Though I look forward to learning more.

Id: [0x000F73A5]
It's good to meet you, as well. I've looked forward to getting to know you.

Id: [0x000F73A6]
Good to meet you, too. Your reputation is quite mysterious.

Id: [0x000F73A7]
The pleasure is all mine. Your reputation precedes you.

Id: [0x000F73B3]
Glad to meet you, as well. I've heard a lot about you.

Id: [0x000F73B4]
It's good to finally meet you, as well.

Id: [0x000F73B5]
I like to know more about my allies before working with them.

Id: [0x000F73B6]
Before jumping into a partnership, I'd prefer to get to know you... at least a little.

Id: [0x000F73B7]
Before we talk business, why don't you tell me about yourself?

Id: [0x000F73B8]
Let's hold off on talking business until you introduce yourself.

Id: [0x000F73B9]
I'd be interested in knowing more about you first.

Id: [0x000F73BA]
You've got my attention.

Id: [0x000F73BB]
Go on.

Id: [0x000F73BC]
What do you need?

Id: [0x000F73BD]
What exactly are we talking about?

Id: [0x000F73BE]
What can I do for you?

Id: [0x000F73BF]
How can I help?

Id: [0x000F73C0]
You've piqued my interest.

Id: [0x000F73C1]
What sort of work needs doing?

Id: [0x000F73C2]
How can I be of service?

Id: [0x000F73C3]
What needs to be done?

Id: [0x000F73C4]
Where am I needed?

Id: [0x000F7425]
I've heard a lot about you, too... but I'd like to know more.

Id: [0x000F7613]
It seems like you're looking for advice. I have none to give.

Id: [0x000F7627]
I should know better than to take advice from a mercenary. Leave me.

Id: [0x000F7697]
I know you're sad about Kynna - it's a big loss. But look around you. You want it to be like <i>this </i>everywhere?

Id: [0x000F7699]
No... But maybe Kynna would get better. They could be wrong about her!

Id: [0x000F769A]
It's not that simple. You don't understand.

Id: [0x000F769B]
How do <i>you </i>know? <i>I </i>know that you didn't help anyone!

Id: [0x000F769D]
There <i>was </i>no right decision to make. Nobody wins.

Id: [0x000F76EE]
Don't regret stopping here, <i>misthios</i>...

Id: [0x000F7721]
Mater?

Id: [0x000F7726]
I'm not your mother. But I'm sure she's proud of you.

Id: [0x000F7727]
Tell her I'm sorry I yelled. I was angry, I didn't mean to...

Id: [0x000F772B]
I'm here.

Id: [0x000F772C]
I'm so cold.

Id: [0x000F772D]
The sea that will carry you is very warm.

Id: [0x000F772E]
I'm sorry I yelled at you. I was angry. It wasn't your fault...

Id: [0x000F772F]
[&shush][shush][/&shush]You have nothing to be sorry for.

Id: [0x000F7734]
He died with honor.

Id: [0x000F7736]
His death was unnecessary.

Id: [0x000F7737]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000F776E]
Good.

Id: [0x000F776F]
You failed to protect the man at your side. Five lashes each.

Id: [0x000F7771]
I was passing by when I saw wolves attacking the boys. This is a Spartan training ground so I left them to it.

Id: [0x000F7773]
I was passing by when the wolves attacked these boys. But they're Spartans in training, so I let them handle things on their own.

Id: [0x000F7774]
She lies! She fought the wolves, clearly wanting glory for herself!

Id: [0x000F7775]
You've interfered with Spartan law and lied about it. There's more honor in that dead boy's heart.

Id: [0x000F7785]
These boys were in trouble. I thought I'd help.

Id: [0x000F7786]
And you. These boys are weaker now because of you. The Spartan army will be weaker because of you. I should kill you where you stand.

Id: [0x000F7787]
The boys were in trouble. I thought I'd help.

Id: [0x000F7788]
No she didn't!

Id: [0x000F7789]
Don't lie to me, boy. You should be ashamed of yourself.

Id: [0x000F7790]
Your friend is dead. There is no glory for you.

Id: [0x000F7791]
And you - lies are the language of cowards.

Id: [0x000F7793]
She's lying! She stood by and did nothing. Now she wants the glory for herself!

Id: [0x000F8152]
It's strange to be back. I spent so long running from this place.

Id: [0x000F8157]
Let me introduce myself. My soldiers call me The Lion of the Dyrads. We don't keep prisoners in these parts - everyone captured is food for the dryad nymphs living in the trees. You join forces with me, and you have the strength of every blood-hungry forest spirit on your side.

Id: [0x000F815B]
TBW: Introduction kind response

Id: [0x000F815D]
TBW: Introduction unkind response

Id: [0x000F8C78]
No matter how far I ran, I never could escape them.

Id: [0x000F8C79]
I know.

Id: [0x000F8C7A]
Did you put your memories of us in that box?

Id: [0x000F8C7B]
I wanted to. But it would have taken all the wood in the land to build one big enough.

Id: [0x000F8E68]
We're trying to make enough drachmae to get out of Kephallonia. It's about time we moved on.

Id: [0x000F8E69]
I think she could.

Id: [0x000F8E78]
Are you scared of sharks, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x000F8E7A]
All right. I'll kill your shark.

Id: [0x000F8EAD]
I'm not scared of anything.

Id: [0x000F8EAF]
Have you seen their teeth?

Id: [0x000F8EB1]
A shark?

Id: [0x000F8EB2]
That makes one of us. A very hungry one swims in our way of leaving Kephallonia.

Id: [0x000F8EB3]
[&breath]Believe us, we have - and we won't go near them again! A shark is guarding our one guaranteed way out of Kephallonia.

Id: [0x000F8F07]
And the fool didn't think! Water rises. Now, the necklace may as well belong to the shark. Vegetable-drachmae is all right, but necklace-drachmae is best.

Id: [0x000F8F09]
It's buried in a chest. If you get it for us, we'll take what we need to get out, and you can keep the rest!

Id: [0x000F8F0B]
He guards a precious necklace. We get it, sell it, and leave Kephallonia! The old bandit who found it first buried the necklace on the shore, near a temple.

Id: [0x000F8F10]
You'll skewer him.

Id: [0x000F8F11]
You'll find him deep in the Ruins of Kranioi down south.

Id: [0x000F8F13]
One shark versus both of you? Find a weapon and you've got yourself a necklace.

Id: [0x000F8F15]
[&breath]We're food if we try again.

Id: [0x000F8F16]
[&breath]I suppose we'll stick to vegetables.

Id: [0x000F8F1D]
One can be found in the fort on Zarax Point. Another was assigned to guard a Spartan leader's house. The third is more elusive. He was last seen in one of the villages west of Helot Hills. He's definitely the loudest of the three.

Id: [0x000F8F24]
A question for you.

Id: [0x000F8F25]
Yes, ask!

Id: [0x000F8F27]
My <i>mater</i> spoke of these <i>krypteia. </i>What can you tell me about them?

Id: [0x000F8F28]
They are the hidden ones. Handpicked at an early age. Starved and trained in isolation. They must steal and kill to survive. If they succeed at their training, they become the king's guard.

Id: [0x000F8F29]
Is there anything I should know about King Archidamos?

Id: [0x000F8F2A]
Traditional. Brutal. Boring. Archidamos values the old ways over the welfare of his people. He sided with the elders that day on Mount Taygetos.

Id: [0x000F8F2D]
If killing <i>krypteia</i> will get our home back, I'll do it.

Id: [0x000F8F2F]
Where on the island are these ruins?

Id: [0x000F8F30]
You know the Sunken Islet of Zeus? Find that, and you'll find the ruins.

Id: [0x000F8F39]
Buried treasure usually has a story.

Id: [0x000F8F3A]
The necklace was said to belong to Prokris - you know, the wife of Kephalos. On the eve of their wedding, he gave it to her as a promise of fidelity.

Id: [0x000F8F41]
To the shark's temple I go.

Id: [0x000F8F43]
I'll never look at another vegetable again after this.

Id: [0x000F91C6]
<i>My</i> blood courses through these veins. Not some man's I've never met.

Id: [0x000F91CA]
Leonidas was king, Kassandra.

Id: [0x000F91CC]
So, our blood is the blood of kings.

Id: [0x000F9290]
I hope you've reconsidered, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000F9291]
Finally ready to make some drachmae, I hope.

Id: [0x000F9292]
I hope you've changed your mind, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000F9293]
The contract is still yours if you've changed your mind, mercenary.

Id: [0x000F9294]
Any chance you're ready to aid me, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x000F9295]
Thanks for jumping in. Maybe you'd consider helping Athens again?

Id: [0x000F9296]
Nice to have an ally who's skilled with a blade. I could use more help from someone like you.

Id: [0x000F9298]
I'd hate to think what might've happened if you weren't here. [beat]You know, Athens could use someone as capable as you.

Id: [0x000F9299]
That was close! I could certainly provide more work for a mercenary of your caliber.

Id: [0x000F929B]
You have my thanks. But now that I'm free, there’s more to be done. Would you help?

Id: [0x000F929C]
I never thought I'd get out. Thank you. Would you consider helping me again?

Id: [0x000F9366]
Good. I need it done fast. [beat]And quietly.

Id: [0x000F936F]
Thank you. Please be quick.

Id: [0x000F9370]
I knew I could trust a fellow warrior.

Id: [0x000F9372]
I knew I could trust you.

Id: [0x000F9373]
Please, get this done quickly.

Id: [0x000F9375]
Good. You're a tough one.

Id: [0x000F9376]
Ha! A true warrior!

Id: [0x000F9377]
Glad to see you're braver than you look.

Id: [0x000F937C]
I'm glad to have someone of your strength on my side.

Id: [0x000F93C1]
Well met! You're a true warrior, <i>misthios,</i> and you've earned this.

Id: [0x000F93C2]
You have my thanks. You've more than held up your end of the bargain. Now it's time I held up mine.

Id: [0x000F93C3]
Well done, my friend. You've earned your keep, that's for sure. Please, accept this as thanks.

Id: [0x000F93C4]
I knew you were the type to get the job done. Here, take this as a sign of my gratitude.

Id: [0x000F93C5]
I owe you more than words can say. So I'll let this payment speak for me.

Id: [0x000F93C6]
I asked you to complete one simple task. One simple task.

Id: [0x000F93C7]
How could you let this happen? This is a mess.

Id: [0x000F93C8]
Of course, I chose today to put my faith in a complete fool. Of course.

Id: [0x000F93C9]
How could you fuck this up? It was so simple!

Id: [0x000F93D1]
Lazy piece of...

Id: [0x000F93D4]
Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x000F93D7]
No help at all.

Id: [0x000F93DF]
And yet I grew up in the dirt!

Id: [0x000F93E0]
You are so much more than a mercenary. You carry the blood of heroes, blood of power. Remember what I told you?

Id: [0x000F9669]
[cough]I'm looking for...

Id: [0x000F966B]
You!

Id: [0x000F966C]
Stentor?

Id: [0x000F9670]
I'm here to help, you idiot!

Id: [0x000F9671]
Not after Megaris. Not after what you did.

Id: [0x000F9674]
King Archidamos of Sparta sent me to aid you in securing the region.

Id: [0x000F9677]
This is how much he trusts me - he put his faith in a fucking mercenary.

Id: [0x000F9B3F]
Changed your mind?

Id: [0x000F9B40]
Reconsidered?

Id: [0x000F9B41]
Have you given more thought to my offer?

Id: [0x000F9B42]
Finally ready to serve Sparta?

Id: [0x000F9B43]
Sparta needs you, <i>misthios</i>. Have you reconsidered?

Id: [0x000F9B4A]
You're a true warrior. Maybe you'd like to serve Sparta again?

Id: [0x000F9B4C]
If there's more fight in you, I could use your help.

Id: [0x000F9B53]
Looks like I owe you my life. Maybe I could repay you with some work?

Id: [0x000F9B55]
You proved yourself today, <i>misthios</i>. But there's drachmae to earn if you're willing to do it again.

Id: [0x000F9B5C]
Never thought I'd get out of here. I can pay you if you'll help me again.

Id: [0x000F9B5E]
There's no worse fate than dying a prisoner. But now that I'm free, I need your help again.

Id: [0x000F9CF8]
For Sparta.

Id: [0x000F9D01]
Thank the gods.

Id: [0x000F9D06]
Ha! Excellent.

Id: [0x000F9DBC]
There's more to life than marching to your death. It's time I sail under a new flag.

Id: [0x000F9DBD]
They feed us pig's blood. Whip us to keep us training. I'd gladly join your crew as a free sailor.

Id: [0x000F9DBE]
The life of a soldier is short, and the pay is shit. If I sail with you, I at least have a chance of making a decent wage.

Id: [0x000F9DBF]
And leave my post? No true Spartan would abandon his post.

Id: [0x000F9DC0]
I could never dishonor my family by abandoning Sparta.

Id: [0x000F9DC1]
You have your path in life, but this is mine. I will never stop fighting for the glory of Sparta.

Id: [0x000F9DC2]
Good! Take this. You earned it.

Id: [0x000F9DC3]
Thank you, mercenary. Now, your reward.

Id: [0x000F9DC4]
Sparta owes you a great debt. Take this.

Id: [0x000F9DC5]
You've served Sparta well. This is for you.

Id: [0x000F9DC6]
Well done! Sparta is in your debt. Here, as thanks.

Id: [0x000F9DC7]
I can't believe I put my faith in you.

Id: [0x000F9DC8]
This task was fit for a child, and you still screwed it up.

Id: [0x000F9DC9]
You'll never get work from me again, mercenary.

Id: [0x000F9DCA]
You failed me, mercenary.

Id: [0x000F9DCB]
I was counting on you, <i>misthios</i>, and you failed.

Id: [0x000F9DD1]
Reconsider, mercenary.

Id: [0x000F9DD3]
Think it over.

Id: [0x000F9DD5]
Guess you're not a true warrior.

Id: [0x000F9DDC]
I know what you mean.

Id: [0x000F9DDE]
Wait. Kreusa, you think she could help us?

Id: [0x000F9E7F]
Though my troops have fought valiantly, the Spartans have us surrounded. Their general is just too cunning a tactician.

Id: [0x000F9ECE]
You mean this?

Id: [0x000F9ECF]
My vase! You found it!

Id: [0x000F9ED2]
Yes.

Id: [0x000F9ED3]
That's great news! Who took it?

Id: [0x000F9EFD]
Kephalos had a spear?

Id: [0x000F9EFE]
Kassandra. Surely you've heard this story since you were a child.

Id: [0x000F9EFF]
I didn't have much time for stories.

Id: [0x000F9F00]
His spear was a gift from the Gods. It was said never to miss its target.

Id: [0x000F9F18]
Well. Perhaps you didn't.

Id: [0x000F9F19]
But you know Kephalos founded Kephallonia and started the line of Odysseus.

Id: [0x000F9F1D]
He must have hidden it in the caves after killing his wife with it.

Id: [0x000F9F1F]
He threw a spear that wouldn't miss at his wife?

Id: [0x000F9F20]
He was hunting and heard her in the bushes. He thought she was a deer. It's a sad story.

Id: [0x000F9F21]
Sounds dangerous.

Id: [0x000F9F22]
Well, only if you throw it at someone!

Id: [0x000F9F91]
Leonidas. He was Sparta's last true hero. We'd all be under the yoke of the Persian Empire if it wasn't for his courage.

Id: [0x000F9F92]
The same blood courses through your veins.

Id: [0x000F9F98]
Well, well, well. Mother and daughter united in Sparta at last. And look at you! Goddesses among mortals.

Id: [0x000F9F99]
King Pausanias, we're honored. I was sorry to hear about your father.

Id: [0x000F9F9B]
Yes. Our fathers would have been proud to see us here today.

Id: [0x000F9F9C]
You remember Kassandra, my king?

Id: [0x000FA0F5]
Spartan laws destroyed my family. Spartan laws had me claw my way through the streets!

Id: [0x000FA0F9]
I've spent my whole life looking over my shoulder. If Sparta is to be my home again, I'd rather it be a peaceful one.

Id: [0x000FA0FA]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]Peace at what cost? When Spartans aren't killing, they're training to kill. And when they're not killing Athenians, they're declaring war on their own people.

Id: [0x000FA322]
Winning the wreath is important for Sparta. You think he can do it?

Id: [0x000FA325]
I need to get this champion of yours to Elis. I hope he lives up to your promise.

Id: [0x000FA43C]
Tell me you've had a change of heart.

Id: [0x000FA43D]
Have you come around, then?

Id: [0x000FA43E]
Will you help me after all, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x000FA43F]
I could really use your help, you know.

Id: [0x000FA440]
Still got a job for you.

Id: [0x000FA447]
By Zeus, I'm glad you came. There's something else you could help me with, though, if you're willing.

Id: [0x000FA449]
I'm lucky you're on my side. Maybe you could help me out again?

Id: [0x000FA450]
You're clearly a very capable mercenary. Perhaps you'd be interested in a job worthy of your skills?

Id: [0x000FA452]
You're crafty with a blade. I have a job for someone with your skills, if you're interested.

Id: [0x000FA459]
By the gods, thank you. Now that I'm free, though, I need to ask for your help again.

Id: [0x000FA45B]
I owe you. But first, there's something else I need your help with.

Id: [0x000FA6BA]
By Poseidon, I'll be worthy of your crew.

Id: [0x000FA6BB]
I always longed for more adventure than this life has brought me. I'll join you.

Id: [0x000FA6BD]
In my younger days, I would have relished the adventure, <i>misthios</i>. But I've put down roots here.

Id: [0x000FA6BE]
Ha! My wife would kill me before I set foot on your boat. I'm flattered, though.

Id: [0x000FA6C0]
My dear friend, you've earned this!

Id: [0x000FA6C1]
I'm a man of my word, so here's your reward.

Id: [0x000FA6C2]
I owe you more than gratitude, <i>misthios</i>. Please, take this.

Id: [0x000FA6C3]
You do good work. Now, here's your reward.

Id: [0x000FA6C4]
Here, you've earned this.

Id: [0x000FA6C5]
Maybe I should have done this myself after all.

Id: [0x000FA6C6]
That can't be. How could you let this happen?

Id: [0x000FA6C7]
By Zeus, you'd better be joking.

Id: [0x000FA6C8]
How could you mess this up? I was counting on you.

Id: [0x000FA6C9]
By Zeus, you're my undoing.

Id: [0x000FA6CF]
I'll be here if you have a change of heart.

Id: [0x000FA6D1]
The gods have forsaken me.

Id: [0x000FA6D3]
Have you no pity?

Id: [0x000FA70D]
We know Sparta reclaimed our house after what happened to my father in Megaris. We want it back.

Id: [0x000FA70E]
There's rumor of a helot rebellion, and the <i>krypteia</i> are stoking the flames. Savagely killing helots, stealing livestock, and leaving corpses to rot in the streets.

Id: [0x000FA74E]
I saw the note you posted. What's the matter?

Id: [0x000FA74F]
You're the one who left the message on the board. What's going on?

Id: [0x000FA750]
I saw the message you left on the board. What's happening?

Id: [0x000FA87E]
Your face looks like horse shit!

Id: [0x000FA8A5]
I'd appreciate training with a master such as yourself, but that's not why I'm here.

Id: [0x000FA8A9]
If I may offer some advice before you get him, Testikles can be... difficult. A gift of oil is known to put a person on his good side.

Id: [0x000FA8CC]
Well, we know how that turned out.

Id: [0x000FA8CD]
Typical. At least he returned to Prokris in time for her death.

Id: [0x000FA8CF]
Oh, he will. Look for his camp on the southernmost island in Messenia. Good luck!

Id: [0x000FA8D2]
Can you tell me anything about pankration?

Id: [0x000FA8D3]
It's a mix of boxing and wrestling, a fearsome test of skill. Champions come from the farthest corners of the world to compete in Olympia... but not all walk away.

Id: [0x000FA8D4]
I can't wait to see it.

Id: [0x000FAA0F]
Was there something else you needed?

Id: [0x000FAA40]
It's not this necklace, is it? I found it in the Ruins of Kranioi.

Id: [0x000FAA41]
That's it! That's Prokris's necklace!

Id: [0x000FAC0F]
What's the problem?

Id: [0x000FADC7]
I've been praying that you'd reconsider.

Id: [0x000FADC8]
Maybe you're finally ready to do some good work.

Id: [0x000FADC9]
By the gods, I hope you've changed your mind.

Id: [0x000FADCA]
I still need help, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FADCB]
Praise Zeus! I hope you're ready to help.

Id: [0x000FADCC]
I'm grateful the gods sent you to defend me, but I could use more help... if you're interested.

Id: [0x000FADCD]
Ares himself would wonder at your skill. I could use a mercenary of your caliber, you know.

Id: [0x000FADCF]
I had my coin ready for the Ferryman before you came along... But it can be yours instead, if you're willing to work for it.

Id: [0x000FADD0]
You've proven your worth today, mercenary. I have a job for you, if you're willing.

Id: [0x000FADD2]
Thank you for saving me, <i>misthios</i>, but there's more to be done. Please, you have to help me.

Id: [0x000FADD3]
By the gods, you came just in time. But I'm afraid I still need your help...

Id: [0x000FAECC]
I've always thought my destiny might lie on open waters. I'm in.

Id: [0x000FAECD]
I'll admit, I thought my purpose was to serve the gods on land, but... they must have sent you to me for a reason. I'll join you.

Id: [0x000FAECE]
Maybe this is the will of gods. [beat]I'm certainly ready to find out. I'll join you.

Id: [0x000FAECF]
Ha! I'm a priestess, not a sailor. I don't know what I'd do on your boat, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FAED0]
My place is serving the gods with my feet firmly planted on the ground, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FAED1]
What would you want with a priestess on your boat, <i>misthios</i>? Thank you for all you've done, but my place is at the temple.

Id: [0x000FAED2]
The gods thank you, and so do I. Take this.

Id: [0x000FAED3]
Great work, <i>misthios</i>. You've earned your drachmae.

Id: [0x000FAED4]
By Zeus, thank you. Please, take this as reward.

Id: [0x000FAED5]
I knew the gods intended us to meet. Please, take this.

Id: [0x000FAED6]
The gods were smiling on me the day we met. Please, take this.

Id: [0x000FAED7]
The gods were looking down on us today, after all.

Id: [0x000FAED8]
I guess I was wrong to trust you.

Id: [0x000FAED9]
How could you fail such a simple task?

Id: [0x000FAEDA]
You'd have to be a fool to mess this up.

Id: [0x000FAEDB]
So you weren't sent to aid me, but to test my patience.

Id: [0x000FAEE2]
Will no god hear my prayers?

Id: [0x000FAEE5]
Come back if you find a conscience.

Id: [0x000FAEE8]
Reconsider.

Id: [0x000FB3E7]
Ripe vegetables for sale! Cheap as can be! ...Anyone?

Id: [0x000FB3E9]
You'll have to tell me what it is, first.

Id: [0x000FB3EC]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x000FB3ED]
Told you, starting a riot.

Id: [0x000FB3EE]
Listen up, you dogs. Some of you seem to think that because you were born in Lakonia, you have the right to live in Lakonia.

Id: [0x000FB3F0]
My goat is older than him! But he talks like he's king. He kills our men, steals our chickens, and everyone's terrified.

Id: [0x000FB3F1]
You're allowed to live on the condition you produce for the Spartan army.

Id: [0x000FB3F3]
The Spartans fear you more than you fear them.

Id: [0x000FB3F4]
But they're trained soldiers. We're just farmers.

Id: [0x000FB3F5]
[&ahem]He's one. You're many. Let's start a riot, shall we?

Id: [0x000FB3F8]
Lately production has been horse shit!

Id: [0x000FB3FA]
Watch what exactly?

Id: [0x000FB3FB]
Timing wasn't right.

Id: [0x000FB3FE]
You think I want to be here? I'd rather be in Sparta, fighting or fucking.

Id: [0x000FB400]
You couldn't fight or fuck your way out of a grain sack.

Id: [0x000FB402]
It's working!

Id: [0x000FB404]
Timing still not right?

Id: [0x000FB405]
Shut up.

Id: [0x000FB408]
Sparta gives you everything! Land, protection from your enemies...

Id: [0x000FB40D]
Sparta is the real enemy!

Id: [0x000FB410]
Sparta is our enemy!

Id: [0x000FB415]
Well if you're not going to say anything...

Id: [0x000FB416]
Sparta is our real enemy!

Id: [0x000FB418]
Who dares speak while I'm speaking?

Id: [0x000FB44B]
Have you forgotten where to look for my master's vase?

Id: [0x000FB460]
Then stop killing our men and stealing our chickens!

Id: [0x000FB465]
We... also don't want you here!

Id: [0x000FB469]
I don't need protection! I want a pony!

Id: [0x000FB47F]
The killing of helots ends now! You are one, we are many!

Id: [0x000FB481]
Down with the <i>krypteia</i>!

Id: [0x000FB48C]
You've stolen our chickens for the last time! Down with the <i>krypteia</i>! Who's with me?

Id: [0x000FB48F]
<i>Maláka</i>, I'll kill you myself!

Id: [0x000FB491]
And the man who created the Trojan horse and defeated the Cyclops. The one who traveled to the land of the Lotus-Eaters. The one the Odyssey is about? Yes. I am. Why?

Id: [0x000FB492]
You're not the first who's said that, is all.

Id: [0x000FB493]
Well, I trust I don't need to prove my lineage to get up to the palace[2425521].

Id: [0x000FB498]
I am Phaidra, and Sparta has lived off the sweat and blood of my people for too long! You are few, we are many, and our silence ends [&scream]now![/&scream]

Id: [0x000FB499]
Wait! Don't!

Id: [0x000FB4C4]
Stay home. Spend time with your family. Live your own life.

Id: [0x000FB4C5]
Would you rather be remembered? Or happy?

Id: [0x000FB4C6]
Hmm. I'll have to give that some thought. Thank you.

Id: [0x000FB523]
To see the ruins of Odysseus's life. Not to live your own.

Id: [0x000FB549]
Your reputation precedes you, as well.

Id: [0x000FB54B]
I've heard a great deal of stories about you, too. But I'm interested in the truth.

Id: [0x000FB54D]
I've heard a few stories about you, as well.

Id: [0x000FB54F]
Well, I'm looking forward to learning more about you.

Id: [0x000FB551]
It seems my reputation precedes me. I look forward to getting to know you.

Id: [0x000FB5AA]
The gods have looked kindly on these, our champions... but there can be only one winner!

Id: [0x000FB5AC]
Yours is eternal glory!

Id: [0x000FB5B3]
What happened to <i>you</i>?

Id: [0x000FB5B4]
It's nothing, Phoibe. All taken care of now.

Id: [0x000FB5B6]
The Cyclops again, huh? Hasn't he learned his lesson yet?

Id: [0x000FB5B7]
Of course. Help yourself.

Id: [0x000FB5B9]
You hungry too, Ikaros?

Id: [0x000FB5BB]
Do you think Zeus would bless <i>me</i> with an eagle? Like he blessed you, Kassandra? ...Maybe you could ask him for me!

Id: [0x000FB5EF]
Phoibe...

Id: [0x000FB5F0]
I know, I know. He's just an eagle.

Id: [0x000FB5F2]
I'll try to put in a good word for you.

Id: [0x000FB5F6]
So. What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000FB5FA]
Well, I guess I owe Markos a little visit. Thank you, Phoibe.

Id: [0x000FB5FF]
I'll go tell Markos you're coming!

Id: [0x000FB618]
Fun's over. Tell that one-eyed freak if he ever sends you here again, I'm gonna cut out his other eye and feed it to my bird.

Id: [0x000FB61B]
You made a mistake coming here.

Id: [0x000FB627]
[&breath]I can't keep doing this.

Id: [0x000FB62B]
Apparently not.

Id: [0x000FB62E]
Finally!

Id: [0x000FB630]
Skree!

Id: [0x000FB631]
[&hmm]My head...

Id: [0x000FB641]
Killing each other won't heal the wounds of the past.

Id: [0x000FB642]
<i>Pater!</i>

Id: [0x000FB643]
Hello, Stentor.

Id: [0x000FB650]
It's on the road to Sami. He says wine will make him rich!

Id: [0x000FB66C]
Since when has he had a vineyard?

Id: [0x000FB66D]
Yesterday I think?

Id: [0x000FB66E]
So Markos - who owes<i> me </i>drachmae - is buying vineyards? With what money?

Id: [0x000FB670]
I dunno.

Id: [0x000FB671]
Where can I find Markos's new, beautiful estate?

Id: [0x000FB672]
You know the statue of Zeus on Mount Ainos? It's south of that!

Id: [0x000FB681]
This was the first[&breath] and last place I ever felt safe.

Id: [0x000FB682]
Do you remember the first time you held your brother?

Id: [0x000FB686]
I was scared I'd break him. I piled every blanket and pillow we had around me.

Id: [0x000FB689]
I've tried to block out what happened here.

Id: [0x000FB68A]
You were so scared of breaking him. You ran around the house, gathering every pillow and blanket. You piled them all around you, and only then did you feel safe to hold him.

Id: [0x000FB68D]
Even then you held him so tight I thought you would squeeze the life out of him.

Id: [0x000FB68E]
He turned out stronger than we thought.

Id: [0x000FB690]
The gods must be playing tricks on my eyes.

Id: [0x000FB70B]
Oil?

Id: [0x000FB70C]
A muscle rub. He believes it imbues him with the power of Herakles. Look in the Village of Gytheion. His favorite merchant is there.

Id: [0x000FB711]
The other day he knocked out six men and a bull... and he only went to the market to buy fruit.

Id: [0x000FB712]
Where can I find your champion?

Id: [0x000FB713]
I sent Testikles to train on a small island in the Bay of Hades. It's good for him there - isolated. Away from people.

Id: [0x000FB71D]
Huh, you'll be easy!

Id: [0x000FB724]
Don't blink or you'll be seeing stars!

Id: [0x000FB729]
I hope you like pain.

Id: [0x000FB745]
I'm here for the pankration.

Id: [0x000FB746]
You must be joking. The only fighter we're missing is Testikles.

Id: [0x000FB749]
He's a little under the... water - I mean weather.

Id: [0x000FB750]
You're back. Maybe you're not a coward after all.

Id: [0x000FB753]
The Kings of Sparta sent for you.

Id: [0x000FB757]
The gods are punishing me with your presence.

Id: [0x000FB758]
If I was your punishment, you'd already be dead.

Id: [0x000FB759]
Why have the kings sent you?

Id: [0x000FB75C]
What the fuck do you want now?

Id: [0x000FB763]
King Archidamos sent me to conquer the Boeotians, since you clearly can't.

Id: [0x000FB764]
Everything is fine. The Boeotian rebels are a problem, but nothing we can't handle.

Id: [0x000FB766]
And yet he sent me a single traitorous mercenary.

Id: [0x000FB768]
Stentor, relax. I'm here as an ally to Sparta and to you. We've worked together once - we can do it again.

Id: [0x000FB769]
Your help in Megaris might have secured the region for Sparta, but I lost more than I gained. I shouldn't have trusted you then - and why now?

Id: [0x000FB76D]
I missed my new brother so much that when Archidamos sent me here, I jumped at the chance.

Id: [0x000FB76E]
<i>Maláka</i>! The Wolf would’ve ended the war if it weren’t for you. Your help will bring nothing but misery.

Id: [0x000FB776]
Ready to meet the kings?

Id: [0x000FB778]
I’m Testikles.

Id: [0x000FB79B]
I need to do something first, but I'll be back.

Id: [0x000FB79C]
[&laughs]Bring your courage with you.

Id: [0x000FB79E]
Time to go.

Id: [0x000FB7A0]
There you are. I can take you in to see the kings when you're ready.

Id: [0x000FB7A8]
I have a few things to take care of first.

Id: [0x000FB7C6]
You should thank the gods that I've come to help you.

Id: [0x000FB7C7]
The only reason you're still alive is that writ you carry. You're not an ally, just a weapon.

Id: [0x000FB7C8]
Then put me to work.

Id: [0x000FB7CB]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]There are four Boeotian champions fighting for the Athenians: Aristaios, Deianeira, Nesaia, and Drakon.

Id: [0x000FB7CD]
I'm here on business. What's going on?

Id: [0x000FB7CE]
What is the Spartan army doing in Boeotia?

Id: [0x000FB7CF]
We sieged Athens, but Kleon took power and pushed us out. Taking Boeotia will weaken his position.

Id: [0x000FB7FF]
Brasidas! It's amazing you've survived this long, sneaking up on people like that.

Id: [0x000FB804]
I'm glad you're all right. I was happy to get your message.

Id: [0x000FB807]
Easy. First, we need to <i>find </i>him. We're outnumbered, and our spies say he's already sent for Athenian reinforcements.

Id: [0x000FB808]
This is unprecedented, but the crowd will riot if the pankration is cancelled.

Id: [0x000FB809]
The people came for a show. I'll give them one.

Id: [0x000FB80A]
Very well. The competition begins shortly.

Id: [0x000FB80D]
Good to see you, Brasidas. It's been a long time since I rescued you from the warehouse fire in Korinth.

Id: [0x000FB80E]
You look well, Brasidas.

Id: [0x000FB80F]
The rumors were true. You're alive.

Id: [0x000FB810]
Many we thought to be dead are still breathing.

Id: [0x000FB811]
When I heard the two of you came home...

Id: [0x000FB812]
We're in Sparta, but we're not home yet.

Id: [0x000FB816]
As happy as I am to see you, the kings won't be. Especially Archidamos. Your exit from Sparta wasn't exactly... graceful.

Id: [0x000FB817]
He <i>can't</i> still be mad I broke his nose.

Id: [0x000FB818]
You what?

Id: [0x000FB819]
In any case, he hasn't forgotten, but I have an idea that might help him forgive.

Id: [0x000FB81A]
Tell us.

Id: [0x000FB81D]
Spartan soldiers have been giving weapons to the helots. Whoever takes care of these traitors will earn his thanks.

Id: [0x000FB886]
Victory! Nike!

Id: [0x000FB88D]
Waiting won't make this easier.

Id: [0x000FB893]
There could be no more fitting tribute than a quote from Pindar. Let the contest begin!

Id: [0x000FB894]
Welcome to Olympia. Today we gather not in war, but in peace - to honor Zeus and Hera.

Id: [0x000FB89A]
A strong start.

Id: [0x000FB89C]
All welcome our next opponent, Erastos!

Id: [0x000FB8A0]
That was easy.

Id: [0x000FB8A2]
Start?!

Id: [0x000FB8A6]
Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x000FB8A8]
For Hera!

Id: [0x000FB8AC]
But let's see how she does against our reigning champion... Dorieus!

Id: [0x000FB8D7]
What do I need to know before I go in?

Id: [0x000FB8F5]
Everyone coming together peacefully in friendly competition, rather than on a battlefield.

Id: [0x000FB8FC]
Then let's go. Your mother's already inside.

Id: [0x000FB8FF]
We're going to stop Kleon. I give you my word.

Id: [0x000FB907]
Good. Let's move - quickly.

Id: [0x000FB90D]
They won't look kindly on you asking for favors without offering some kind of help first, like taking care of the soldiers arming the helots.

Id: [0x000FB916]
I'm tired of doing people favors. Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x000FB918]
Come on then. Your mother's waiting inside.

Id: [0x000FB91A]
You're right. We need this to go well. I'll come back.

Id: [0x000FB922]
Today, we give everything we have.

Id: [0x000FB928]
I'll find these champions and put and end to them.

Id: [0x000FB929]
I doubt it will be as easy as you think, but I'm relieved to see you can follow orders.

Id: [0x000FB92F]
Archers on the wall!

Id: [0x000FB931]
Kleon won't be far. We need to find him.

Id: [0x000FB943]
Kassandra, come now! Show mercy!

Id: [0x000FB944]
You turned him against us. My own brother.

Id: [0x000FB947]
I beg you! This world is severed, Kassandra, and we'll <i>unite</i> it!

Id: [0x000FB957]
Why am I killing champions? I came to win a battle.

Id: [0x000FB95A]
Either you complete this mission, or you die in the process. I will be satisfied either way.

Id: [0x000FB95F]
And the man who created the Trojan horse and defeated the Cyclops, and travelled to the land of the Lotus-Eaters. The one the Odyssey is about? Yes. I am. Why?

Id: [0x000FB960]
I thought the Boeotians hated everyone. Why are they working with Athens?

Id: [0x000FB963]
I only know of two - there are reports of Aristaios occupying the Military Fort of Gla. Nesaia was last seen in the forest east of Thebes.

Id: [0x000FB965]
They see both Sparta and Athens as enemies - but Athens got here first, and they agreed to a temporary alliance.

Id: [0x000FB966]
Where will I find these mighty Boeotians?

Id: [0x000FB969]
The sooner I get this done, the sooner we take Boeotia for Sparta.

Id: [0x000FB974]
For all their bravery, the Spartans have allowed themselves to get trapped on Sphakteria.

Id: [0x000FB975]
Trapped?

Id: [0x000FB976]
The Athenians have surrounded the island.

Id: [0x000FB984]
By the gods, it's as if we're sailing into the mouth of Hades!

Id: [0x000FBA34]
Where's Brasidas?

Id: [0x000FBA35]
What do you want with him?

Id: [0x000FBA5F]
Don't question me - take me to him.

Id: [0x000FBA60]
It concerns Sparta, so it concerns me.

Id: [0x000FBA64]
Yes... and a friend of Sparta. Now take me to him.

Id: [0x000FBA65]
We fought together.

Id: [0x000FBA66]
A friend?

Id: [0x000FBA68]
If you were so "concerned," you'd be with your brothers preparing for battle. Now let's go.

Id: [0x000FBA6A]
Whatever happened to our old house?

Id: [0x000FBA6B]
Nikolaos stayed after I left. But now that he's... gone, I don't know.

Id: [0x000FBA6F]
I didn't see any of your ships when I came in, but I can help.

Id: [0x000FBA70]
They're... sunk? My father was the captain on one of those ships. [beat]Come. Pledge your spear to Brasidas.

Id: [0x000FBA72]
Stop. I have orders - stand guard and wait for reinforcements. They were due two nights ago.

Id: [0x000FBA74]
You can stop waiting. I've arrived.

Id: [0x000FBA75]
You?! The Athenians are dogs at our throats. You won't talk so tough once you see them.

Id: [0x000FBA77]
I join you, and all they'll see is the ferryman.

Id: [0x000FBA78]
Ha! Well met, warrior. You better fight as good as you talk. Come. We go to Brasidas.

Id: [0x000FBADA]
My kings, may I present Myrrine, descendent of Leonidas, and her daughter Kassandra.

Id: [0x000FBADC]
Speak, Myrrine. Why are you here?

Id: [0x000FBB17]
I heard you'd come back. How dare you step foot on Spartan soil? I should cut it off for what you did.

Id: [0x000FBB1C]
OK, OK. Save it for the fight.

Id: [0x000FBB1E]
You should return to where you came from.

Id: [0x000FBB20]
I'll crush you like an ant.

Id: [0x000FBB27]
They are descendants of Leonidas. For that reason alone they should be allowed to speak.

Id: [0x000FBB29]
I have returned to reclaim my Spartan citizenship. To reclaim our home.

Id: [0x000FBB2A]
[&scoff]You haven't cared for Sparta for many years.

Id: [0x000FBB2C]
You exiled yourself. Your daughter killed an elder and ran.

Id: [0x000FBB2E]
First, prove yourself loyal.

Id: [0x000FBB31]
The Spartan army fights the Athenians in Boeotia. Join the commanders there. Come back victorious, or do not return.

Id: [0x000FBB3B]
You expect me to win a war when your own troops can't?

Id: [0x000FBB3C]
My troops will crush any army under Helios. And if you want your home back you'll go to Boeotia and mind your tongue.

Id: [0x000FBB3F]
Consider the battle won.

Id: [0x000FBB41]
Spoken with the confidence of a <i>child</i> who hasn't seen real war.

Id: [0x000FBB45]
Two kings. Two tasks.

Id: [0x000FBB4C]
I want you to make sure the Spartans return with a wreath.

Id: [0x000FBB86]
One last thing. When you come asking a favor, it's customary to bring a gift.

Id: [0x000FBB88]
A wolf has been attacking farmers on the Dioskouroi Peninsula. People say it's King Lycaon himself, cursed by Zeus to live out his days as a wolf.

Id: [0x000FBB91]
Your estate was taken by Sparta when news of Nikolaos's death arrived. They're waiting for his adopted son to claim it, but he hasn't returned from the war.

Id: [0x000FBBC9]
Sparta claimed your estate after Nikolaos's disappearance. They're waiting for his adopted son to claim it, but he hasn't returned from the war.

Id: [0x000FBBCC]
Your reports are out of date. I killed the wolf some time ago.

Id: [0x000FBBCD]
She follows orders swiftly.

Id: [0x000FBBCE]
We'll see if that's true when you get to Boeotia.

Id: [0x000FBBD9]
You have your orders. We'll see you when your tasks are completed.

Id: [0x000FBBDA]
Next?

Id: [0x000FBBE6]
What do we have to do to get it back?

Id: [0x000FBC00]
What's going on in Boeotia?

Id: [0x000FBC01]
The Athenian army is pushing Sparta back bit by bit. Winning won't be easy.

Id: [0x000FBC03]
What do you know about this [&ahem]fighting champion I'm supposed to take to the Olympics?

Id: [0x000FBC06]
Tell me about this wolf. It's under a curse?

Id: [0x000FBC07]
I'd start near Diros Cave. That's where it was last seen.

Id: [0x000FBC09]
I think I'm ready. And you? What will you do while I'm gone?

Id: [0x000FBC0A]
I received a message just before we went in.

Id: [0x000FBC0B]
What kind of message?

Id: [0x000FBC0C]
A clue to the whereabouts of another Cultist. I'm going to Arkadia.

Id: [0x000FBC0D]
The fates are smiling on us. I was ordered there. We can travel together.

Id: [0x000FBC13]
The weapons have to be here somewhere.

Id: [0x000FBC14]
I need to take down their commander.

Id: [0x000FBC16]
One of the kings is a Cultist... so one of these tasks is surely a trap. But which one?

Id: [0x000FBC17]
Wouldn't say that within earshot of the palace. But I've fought with both of them. I can't believe either is a traitor.

Id: [0x000FBC18]
We need to find proof before we make any accusations. Keep your eyes open.

Id: [0x000FBC1A]
Sparta can't just take our home!

Id: [0x000FBC2E]
What can you tell me about Pausanias?

Id: [0x000FBC30]
Kings Pausanias and Archidamos share rulership. Impress them both, and your home will be returned to you.

Id: [0x000FBC35]
What should I know about Archidamos?

Id: [0x000FBC37]
Archidamos is... a traditionalist. Not one to back down from a fight. He's also got a temper. Try to stay on his good side.

Id: [0x000FBC48]
[ono - inhale] Oh... Well, looks like you're the champion now, ah?

Id: [0x000FBC68]
Kassandra. Good to see you - alive. Pylos didn't go as planned.

Id: [0x000FBC69]
Mind your tongue, child. You may not live in Sparta anymore, but I'm still your king.

Id: [0x000FBC6A]
We graciously request an audience with you and King Archidamos to discuss reinstating our citizenship and reclaiming our home.

Id: [0x000FBC6B]
Of course! There's nothing I'd want more. Archidamos, however, still hasn't forgiven you for the whole... nose incident.

Id: [0x000FBC6C]
What can we do to sway him?

Id: [0x000FBC6D]
I'm on it.

Id: [0x000FBC6F]
You will find my commander at Mt. Helicon. Give him this and tell him I sent you.

Id: [0x000FBC71]
I'll handle it.

Id: [0x000FBC73]
You can count on me.

Id: [0x000FBC75]
I'll take care of it.

Id: [0x000FBC7D]
That doesn't interest me. Find someone else.

Id: [0x000FBC80]
Not interested. Find another mercenary.

Id: [0x000FBC83]
Not today. You'll need to find someone else.

Id: [0x000FBC86]
Find someone else. I'm not interested.

Id: [0x000FBCA0]
Alexios!

Id: [0x000FBCA3]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]When I was little, I found a lion cub trapped in a snare. My friend tried to free it... That's when I heard the deadly growl of its mother.

Id: [0x000FBCAA]
You don’t have a destiny. You’re just a tool used by the Cult.

Id: [0x000FBD35]
Brasidas!

Id: [0x000FBD3B]
Aaaaaargh!

Id: [0x000FBD44]
Where are the kings?

Id: [0x000FBD46]
There.

Id: [0x000FBD4A]
What do you say now?

Id: [0x000FBD4C]
[&laughs][laugh][/&laughs]You made your point, Archidamos. I yield.

Id: [0x000FBD4E]
Another two squadrons to Boeotia, then. As I said.

Id: [0x000FBD51]
Is that how they solve arguments?

Id: [0x000FBD52]
Sometimes.

Id: [0x000FBD54]
Archidamos's guard has improved. He should thank me.

Id: [0x000FBD57]
Brasidas! You've come with news. Let's hear it.

Id: [0x000FBD58]
He's young. Don't mistake his smile for kindness - as with all kings, those who cross him learn to regret it.

Id: [0x000FBD5E]
Even you.

Id: [0x000FC0FB]
I don't want to kill you.

Id: [0x000FC0FC]
All you can do is try.

Id: [0x000FC100]
Our <i>mater</i> sent me to find you.

Id: [0x000FC102]
Our <i>mater</i>?

Id: [0x000FC104]
She wants you to come home... to Sparta.

Id: [0x000FC106]
This is my home!

Id: [0x000FC12B]
We lifted Deimos up. We made him <i>great</i>! Unstoppable!

Id: [0x000FC12C]
You made him a monster.

Id: [0x000FC12D]
Then fight by his side - teach him! You would have Deimos once again.

Id: [0x000FC130]
His name is Alexios.

Id: [0x000FC134]
They need to be shot down! Now!

Id: [0x000FC13F]
Show the helots we no longer support the senseless slaughtering of their people.

Id: [0x000FC140]
And where would I start looking for these <i>krypteia</i>?

Id: [0x000FC18A]
[&ah]That's right. You've never had an audience with the two kings.

Id: [0x000FC18B]
I've met Pausanias.

Id: [0x000FC18D]
King Pausanias. [&ahem]Really.

Id: [0x000FC193]
Brasidas.

Id: [0x000FC1A2]
Bring glory to Sparta, and redeem yourself in the eyes of the gods. Until then, neither you, nor your mother, have a right to your lands.

Id: [0x000FC1CB]
You're a fool, Melanippos. A fool.

Id: [0x000FC1CC]
Did you lose your pankration match?

Id: [0x000FC4AC]
Alexios!

Id: [0x000FC4B9]
[ono - breath]You promised you would bring him home.

Id: [0x000FC4C4]
You're new. If it's training you want, we don't just take anyone.

Id: [0x000FC4C5]
Forgive me. I didn't know a royal messenger was coming. I'm Alkon, Testikles's trainer.

Id: [0x000FC4C7]
I told you we could work this out.

Id: [0x000FC4E4]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000FC4F3]
Deimos! ...This fight is between you and me.

Id: [0x000FC4F4]
Worse. I lost my one true love. My Drakon has found someone else - I just know it. He avoids me, and when we're together he's always distracted...

Id: [0x000FC50C]
I needs to be oiled 'fore I goes to the Games.

Id: [0x000FC50E]
Well, I would have been happy to... assist, if you were in any state to compete.

Id: [0x000FC50F]
[ono - breathing]I likes to be oiled.

Id: [0x000FC510]
Well, that's obvious.

Id: [0x000FC512]
Yeah, you knows.

Id: [0x000FC57E]
Whadda you want from the great champion Testikles? Can't you see I'm... busy?

Id: [0x000FC583]
I'm here to take you to the Olympics.

Id: [0x000FC58B]
I admit, it doesn't sound good.

Id: [0x000FC58C]
Even <i>you</i> think I've been replaced. But I can't let him go. He's my golden <i>demigod.</i>

Id: [0x000FC58D]
Maybe there's still a chance?

Id: [0x000FC58E]
I can't leave this up to the whims of Tyche. I won't let Drakon go.

Id: [0x000FC5EF]
Then you must have a plan.

Id: [0x000FC5F0]
I'm going to make a potion. It's a recipe that guarantees eternal love.

Id: [0x000FC5F1]
That's an honest way to save a relationship.

Id: [0x000FC5F8]
I'd rather stay out of it for now.

Id: [0x000FC615]
I can find her for you. I must believe in love after all.

Id: [0x000FC616]
Thank you, thank you.

Id: [0x000FC62F]
Please help me win back my beautiful Drakon.

Id: [0x000FC638]
Rare herb, huh? What is it?

Id: [0x000FC639]
An herb hot enough to <i>impassion</i> him. Red hot to make his affections - and his skin - sizzle.

Id: [0x000FC64C]
To the Olympics! The people needs me!

Id: [0x000FC64D]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]He'd better fucking win.

Id: [0x000FC65C]
Not an event, my king. By making sure Sparta wins the <i>entire</i> Olympics.

Id: [0x000FC667]
<i>Malakas!</i>[Asshole!]

Id: [0x000FC674]
How would you fucking know? Traitor.

Id: [0x000FC675]
I am not a traitor.

Id: [0x000FC676]
You betrayed Sparta. You betrayed your family -

Id: [0x000FC678]
You killed my father and stole my chance at a normal life. You deserve nothing but the cold of my blade buried in your heart.

Id: [0x000FC67C]
And your grave.

Id: [0x000FC689]
I'll go find that herb for you.

Id: [0x000FC68E]
I'm here to face the kings.

Id: [0x000FC698]
I'm not complete without Drakon's love. And the potion's not complete without all the ingredients.

Id: [0x000FC6AD]
There! Over there.

Id: [0x000FC6B1]
You silly, lovestruck fool, Melanippos. Thinking he loved you as you are.

Id: [0x000FC6B6]
Still looking for that herbalist.

Id: [0x000FC6B8]
I'm sure.

Id: [0x000FC6B9]
I'll gather the ephors and meet you in the throne room.

Id: [0x000FC6BA]
I don't know. Maybe I should look some more?

Id: [0x000FC6BB]
Accusing a king is not something you can take back. Make sure you're absolutely ready.

Id: [0x000FC6BE]
Who are the ephors?

Id: [0x000FC6BF]
You don't remember? Then again, you were only a child.

Id: [0x000FC6C0]
The five ephors are elected from the citizens of Sparta. They have power over even the kings. You need to convince them if you wish to save Sparta from the Cult's control.

Id: [0x000FC6C2]
See you in the throne room.

Id: [0x000FC6C7]
That could have ended badly.

Id: [0x000FC6D4]
But you didn't. So now, I will choose your gift for you.

Id: [0x000FC6D5]
I will kill this animal and bring you its head.

Id: [0x000FC6E4]
[&grunt]What are we waiting for?

Id: [0x000FC6E7]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

Id: [0x000FC6E8]
If you have nothing but good news to share, why did you call for the ephors?

Id: [0x000FC6ED]
Testikles, it's an honor to sail with you. Your victory at the Pythian games is legendary.

Id: [0x000FC6EE]
What made you kick him in the head instead of going for a grapple?

Id: [0x000FC6EF]
Felt like it.

Id: [0x000FC6F1]
I never thought I'd actually get to see the Olympics - with a champion no less!

Id: [0x000FC6F3]
On Naxos I could forget. It was as if I had locked Sparta in a box and tossed it to the bottom of the sea.

Id: [0x000FC6F5]
<i>If</i> they're completed.

Id: [0x000FC6F7]
There's some Spartan left in you after all.

Id: [0x000FC703]
You act as if you don't know. Against you, Pausanias.

Id: [0x000FC709]
Can't see the appeal.

Id: [0x000FC70A]
You'd think they'd just kill each other like everywhere else.

Id: [0x000FC70B]
That's the magic of the Olympics.

Id: [0x000FC70F]
I don't know how to feel. I spent some of the happiest days of my life here. [beat]And some of the worst too.

Id: [0x000FC711]
Archidamos. Sparta must be rid of you before it's too late.

Id: [0x000FC712]
Yes... I am!

Id: [0x000FC714]
Ah, improvisation. Keep your opponent off guard - a good strategy.

Id: [0x000FC715]
Strategy's for people who don't hit hard enough.

Id: [0x000FC718]
Why don't we go find out?

Id: [0x000FC719]
Of course. But first, there's something I want to show you.

Id: [0x000FC71A]
If anyone can turn the tide there, it's you.

Id: [0x000FC71C]
You're back.

Id: [0x000FC71D]
The champions have been dealt with.

Id: [0x000FC71E]
You should be dead.

Id: [0x000FC728]
The Pankration fighter. His trainer will know where he is.

Id: [0x000FC729]
Things are not quite what they seem. But you must keep this champion safe at all costs to succeed.

Id: [0x000FC72A]
I will.

Id: [0x000FC72E]
There, your herb. It better be worth all the trouble.

Id: [0x000FC72F]
Yes, yes. Drakon is mine 'til the end of time. Maybe I'll take him for a moonlit walk at the Site of Iphigenia's Sacrifice... He won't have to go far from his training site.

Id: [0x000FC731]
It's simple. I'll "borrow" his precious armor for a few days, coat the inside, and let the potion seep through his skin - straight to his heart.

Id: [0x000FC732]
So... Drakon will be left without his armor. Aren't you worried he'll be vulnerable?

Id: [0x000FC733]
Oh, he's the strongest, most <i>chiseled</i> man in Thebes. He'll be fine without it.

Id: [0x000FC734]
And his armor?

Id: [0x000FC735]
It waits patiently for the potion in my house.

Id: [0x000FC738]
He was so small.

Id: [0x000FC73A]
It's causing a lot of trouble on the Dioskouroi Peninsula. You'll be doing the people there a favor if you get rid of it.

Id: [0x000FC73B]
Where can I find it?

Id: [0x000FC73E]
Brasidas?

Id: [0x000FC764]
That would be helpful. My thanks.

Id: [0x000FC765]
I'll meet you both in Arkadia, then. Safe journeys.

Id: [0x000FC767]
They're not punishing you - they're helping you. Why do you think I'm here?

Id: [0x000FC768]
I'm a mercenary - killing is what I do. There's nothing godly about it.

Id: [0x000FCA75]
What seems to be the problem?

Id: [0x000FCA76]
Empedokles be praised, a misthios! I've done nothing wrong, yet these priestesses mean me harm! Please - my god is powerful! And rich!

Id: [0x000FCA77]
His "god" is a malákas - a blasphemous blight on Aphrodite's hallowed soil! This is a matter for priestesses alone.

Id: [0x000FCA7E]
You said "rich"?

Id: [0x000FCA82]
These ladies have you taken care of. Best of luck.

Id: [0x000FCA86]
I will pray to Empedokles for your return.

Id: [0x000FCA8B]
Indeed! Empedokles rewards those who come to his call! These priestesses have imprisoned him in the fort. He's a god - he deserves worship.

Id: [0x000FCA8E]
He doesn't sound like much of a god to me.

Id: [0x000FCA92]
Empedokles is not that kind of god.

Id: [0x000FCA97]
You're threatened by a mob, but you want me to save <i>him, </i>not <i>you? </i>Sounds like quite the god.

Id: [0x000FCA98]
Only Empedokles can lead us to his brothers and sisters on Mt. Olympus. He is far more important than any one man.

Id: [0x000FCAB1]
Surely you cannot be considering helping these lunatics! You would oppose the will of Aphrodite!

Id: [0x000FCAB2]
If these priestesses speak for Aphrodite, then I speak for all three slobbering heads of Cerberus.

Id: [0x000FCABD]
I don't have time for this. Sparta must take this region now, while we have the chance.

Id: [0x000FCAC6]
I didn't expect this to be pleasant.

Id: [0x000FCAD4]
You come to steal from me too, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x000FCAD5]
Is that how you greet all your customers?

Id: [0x000FCAD6]
I’m sorry. The soldiers have taken everything from me - even my beloved Spyro.

Id: [0x000FCAD9]
He was never coming home.

Id: [0x000FCADA]
You broke your word. Now when I look at you, all I see is death.

Id: [0x000FCADC]
I want you to leave Sparta. Go!

Id: [0x000FCADD]
Leave Sparta?

Id: [0x000FCADE]
And never come back.

Id: [0x000FCAF2]
The kings were generous to give us a second chance.

Id: [0x000FCAFB]
This belonged to our grandfather.

Id: [0x000FCAFF]
You're home now.

Id: [0x000FCB00]
I've done terrible things.

Id: [0x000FCB01]
We all have, Alexios.

Id: [0x000FCB05]
I know.

Id: [0x000FCB06]
Kassandra, wait.

Id: [0x000FCB6A]
Always forward, my brave Kassandra.

Id: [0x000FCB71]
Are you ready yet? My men grow impatient.

Id: [0x000FCB8C]
That wasn't your son.

Id: [0x000FCB8F]
I'm sorry.

Id: [0x000FCB92]
Come, let's go home.

Id: [0x000FCBA0]
Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x000FCBA1]
I couldn't agree more. The sooner I'm rid of you, the better.

Id: [0x000FCBA3]
I need more time.

Id: [0x000FCBA4]
The Athenians aren't going to kill themselves, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FCBA7]
Spyro will have to wait.

Id: [0x000FCBAD]
If you need him so badly, I'll find your Spyro.

Id: [0x000FCBAE]
They must have him at the military camp[2164643] east of Snake Head Rock. It's the only outpost nearby.

Id: [0x000FCBB5]
Those Athenian thieves are only <i>dressed </i>as soldiers.

Id: [0x000FCBBE]
Spyro must be stabled in the military camp[2164643]. They're keeping him prisoner.

Id: [0x000FCBBF]
What are you talking about? How dare you stand in the presence of kings and make such accusations?

Id: [0x000FCBC0]
Present your proof.

Id: [0x000FCBC1]
Archidamos is a member of the Cult of Kosmos and a traitor to Sparta!

Id: [0x000FCBC2]
The Cult of what? Ridiculous! What proof could you possibly have?

Id: [0x000FCBC3]
This isn't proof of anything. Ephors should only be called upon for serious matters. This lack of evidence is a waste of our time and disrespectful to the thrones of Sparta. The accuser should be made into an example for all other reckless fools.

Id: [0x000FCBC5]
Agreed. A wise ruling.

Id: [0x000FCBC9]
Pausanias blackmailed Lagos of Arkadia. He held the archon's family hostage in exchange for helping the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x000FCBCA]
So, Lagos finally turned. He has more spine than I thought.

Id: [0x000FCBCC]
You deserve death for your crimes.

Id: [0x000FCBCD]
How dare you threaten a king?

Id: [0x000FCBCE]
Pausanias, you are king no more. As of this day, you are exiled from Sparta.

Id: [0x000FCBCF]
Before Athena and Ares, I swear you'll regret this! Justice will be done!

Id: [0x000FCBD2]
Lagos? Is this true?

Id: [0x000FCBD3]
We had received word from other sources, but with nothing definite we would not accuse a king.

Id: [0x000FCBD5]
Forgive us, my king. My daughter couldn't let him stay in power any longer.

Id: [0x000FCBD6]
Of course not.

Id: [0x000FCBD8]
Your home is returned!

Id: [0x000FCBD9]
I will. He is a Cultist after all.

Id: [0x000FCBDD]
Victory is ours!

Id: [0x000FCBE5]
I have travelled Spartan lands and beyond and found proof of Pausanias's betrayal. He's a member of the Cult of Kosmos. These traitors are willing to kill hundreds to rule thousands. Here's all the proof you need.

Id: [0x000FCBEB]
We'll see about that.

Id: [0x000FCBEC]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000FCBEE]
Your job is done, mercenary. Now I will kill you for what you stole from me in Megaris.

Id: [0x000FCBF2]
Kassandra! You were condemned to be hunted.

Id: [0x000FCBFA]
I was wrong to accuse you. It was Pausanias plaguing Sparta and its territories.

Id: [0x000FCBFB]
What a disgrace. First you accuse me, and now Pausanias? Where is he?

Id: [0x000FCC0B]
I watched him die.

Id: [0x000FCC0C]
You murdered him...

Id: [0x000FCC0D]
Yes.

Id: [0x000FCC0F]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000FCC10]
One more thing.

Id: [0x000FCC11]
Yes?

Id: [0x000FCC12]
Should you decide to rule Sparta yourself, at least let me face you in battle.

Id: [0x000FCC13]
I'm not made for ruling, my king.

Id: [0x000FCC15]
It doesn't matter.

Id: [0x000FCC16]
It does to me.

Id: [0x000FCC31]
The victory is yours. You led us well today.

Id: [0x000FCC32]
My father taught me all I know about commanding an army. Too bad you took him from me - or I might have learned more.

Id: [0x000FCC33]
Stop...

Id: [0x000FCC35]
If I hadn't been here, you'd never have survived.

Id: [0x000FCC36]
My father would have ensured a more decisive victory, but he's not here. We have you to thank for that, if I recall.

Id: [0x000FCC37]
[&scoff]Don't start...

Id: [0x000FCC3E]
What I would do to see you again, Spyro... If only.

Id: [0x000FCC40]
Proof? What proof?

Id: [0x000FCC43]
So the rumors are true... We never would have thought a king could be so dishonorable.

Id: [0x000FCC44]
Honor belongs to history.

Id: [0x000FCC46]
You don't have to do this, Stentor.

Id: [0x000FCC47]
Oh, but I do. There is nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.

Id: [0x000FCC48]
This isn't what Nikolaos would've wanted.

Id: [0x000FCC4A]
Why are you doing this?

Id: [0x000FCC4B]
Because - [beat]Because you marched into Megaris. Ruined the fucking war. And murdered - my - father.

Id: [0x000FCC4C]
What could you possibly gain from killing me?

Id: [0x000FCC4D]
Justice, vengeance, peace. One would be enough, but all three is better.

Id: [0x000FCC52]
They can. They did. And if you want it back you'll have to convince the kings, which won't be easy.

Id: [0x000FCC54]
We want our house back, Brasidas.

Id: [0x000FCC55]
You'll need to negotiate your Spartan citizenship with the kings. It won't be easy.

Id: [0x000FCC99]
Why not?

Id: [0x000FCCAD]
Surely, he can swim.

Id: [0x000FCCB7]
SPARTA!!!

Id: [0x000FCD72]
Where will I find these Spartans?

Id: [0x000FCD73]
They were last spotted in the Gorani Marble Quarry, in the Forest of Eurotas.

Id: [0x000FCD78]
Why on earth would Spartan soldiers be helping helots?

Id: [0x000FCD79]
Helots greatly outnumber Spartan citizens. But they're leaderless - mostly farm hands, servants, and apprentices. If someone unified them, armed them and trained them, they'd be a real threat to Sparta.

Id: [0x000FCD7A]
But you said it was Spartans who were arming them.

Id: [0x000FCD7B]
All the more reason to deal with this quickly. You'll find out why the helots are being armed, and you'll have the kings' attention.

Id: [0x000FCD7D]
So, I find the soldiers. Then what?

Id: [0x000FCD7E]
Spartans are loyal to their commander. Take him out, and the rest should disperse.

Id: [0x000FCD7F]
And the weapons?

Id: [0x000FCD80]
Destroy them. The helots have caused enough trouble with shovels and sickles, the last thing Sparta needs right now is them carrying swords.

Id: [0x000FCD82]
So, to get our house back, I must take out the Spartan commander responsible for inciting a useless rebellion. Sounds easy enough.

Id: [0x000FCD83]
Find me in the throne room when it's done.

Id: [0x000FCD84]
And where will you be?

Id: [0x000FCD85]
This is where I raised you - it's also where Leonidas raised me. I'm going to visit his tomb, just beyond the estate. You should pay your respects, too, before you get started.

Id: [0x000FCD8F]
Those children will be ripped to shreds! We should help them!

Id: [0x000FCD91]
Are you all right? What happened?

Id: [0x000FCD99]
I did as you said. I did nothing.

Id: [0x000FCD9A]
This isn't Kephallonia, Naxos, or anywhere else. Breaking Spartan law can get you killed.

Id: [0x000FCD9C]
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

Id: [0x000FCD9D]
The agoge is what turns boys into men. And soldiers into Spartans. You have only made them weaker by interfering.

Id: [0x000FCD9E]
What good are they to anyone if they're dead?

Id: [0x000FCD9F]
Kassandra, please! This isn't Kephallonia, Naxos, or anywhere else. This is Sparta, and breaking Spartan law can get you killed.

Id: [0x000FCDA0]
Believe me, <i>mater.</i> I know <i>exactly</i> what breaking Spartan law gets you.

Id: [0x000FCDA3]
Come. Let's go home.

Id: [0x000FCDB2]
I did as you said<i>. </i>I did nothing.

Id: [0x000FCDB3]
This isn't Kephallonia, Naxos, or anywhere else. Breaking Spartan law can get you killed.

Id: [0x000FCDB4]
I couldn't just stand by and watch.

Id: [0x000FCDB5]
The agoge is what turns boys into men. And soldiers into Spartans. You have only made them weaker by interfering.

Id: [0x000FCDB6]
What good are they to anyone if they're dead?

Id: [0x000FCDB7]
Kassandra, please! This isn't Kephallonia, Naxos, or anywhere else. This is Sparta, and breaking Spartan law can get you killed.

Id: [0x000FCDB8]
Are you all right? What happened?

Id: [0x000FCDBC]
Believe me, <i>mater.</i> I know <i>exactly</i> what breaking Spartan law gets you.

Id: [0x000FCDBF]
Come. Let's go home.

Id: [0x000FCDC7]
[ONO, cries in pain]Help! I can't feel my legs!

Id: [0x000FCDCA]
Your god will be fine waiting a little longer. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x000FCDCC]
Time to go save a god. Apparently.

Id: [0x000FCDCE]
I'll be fine. Is there anything else you need to know?

Id: [0x000FCDD1]
Do as you will, misthios. But even you cannot be everywhere at once.

Id: [0x000FCDD9]
"No doubt foresaw"?

Id: [0x000FCDDA]
Well, uh, it's hard to know exactly what he does or doesn't know - he's imprisoned in the fort, and my duty is to hold vigil here.

Id: [0x000FCDDC]
Praise Empedokles, you've returned - just as he no doubt foresaw you would!

Id: [0x000FCDE1]
Empedokles remains in bondage!

Id: [0x000FCDE3]
I've had worse evenings.

Id: [0x000FCDE4]
He's a god - and he knows the way to the gods! Will you go to his aid?

Id: [0x000FCE43]
A god such as I deserves more leg room!

Id: [0x000FCE45]
I! Am! A! God! And you will return my robe to me, washed and neatly folded!

Id: [0x000FCE47]
Imprison me if you must - but do not hurt my beloved cloak, you, you MONSTERS!

Id: [0x000FCE56]
Empedokles can lead us all to meet the gods! He knows the way! We must worship him!

Id: [0x000FCE5D]
I am a god and beyond such mortal concerns as "hunger"!

Id: [0x000FCE61]
Do I smell lamb?

Id: [0x000FCE63]
Animals are where punished human souls dwell. To eat a beast is to eat man himself! A disgraceful act! I cannot crave their... succulent, mouth-watering flesh. Calm! Clear your mind. Think of the elements. Earth. Wind. Fire. Water. Lamb. Ah, <i>maláka!</i>

Id: [0x000FCE6D]
Do not worry for my safety, misthios - it is Empedokles who needs your help!

Id: [0x000FCE7B]
Look upon my form, mortals! Regard my godly gifts and know the truth of my words!

Id: [0x000FCE7F]
Do you see, feeble humans? I, the great Empedokles, cannot be caged! Worship me, and I offer you an audience... with the gods!

Id: [0x000FCE92]
Put down your blades. I offer those who follow me an audience with my brothers and sisters, the gods!

Id: [0x000FCE94]
Gods cannot bleed! So - so you best put down your blades.

Id: [0x000FCE96]
DO NOT STAB MY GODLY GROIN!!!

Id: [0x000FCEF0]
I thought you were dead.

Id: [0x000FCEF2]
Not just yet.

Id: [0x000FCEF4]
She should pay for what she's done!

Id: [0x000FCEF6]
I don't understand.

Id: [0x000FCEF7]
You both have a greater role to play. Become the leader I trained you to be - lead the armies of Sparta and be victorious.

Id: [0x000FCEF8]
How?

Id: [0x000FCEF9]
You are an honorable man, a loyal son, and a great warrior. You will be a better commander than I ever was. You can do this.

Id: [0x000FCEFC]
You already have.

Id: [0x000FCF1B]
I'll see Markos as soon as I'm dressed.

Id: [0x000FCF20]
I ask you again - rescue my poor Spyro.

Id: [0x000FCF27]
I'm proud of my lineage, but I carve my own path.

Id: [0x000FCF2B]
I'm playing for Abreas, my brother.

Id: [0x000FCF2F]
Soldiers take what they want. Who is Spyro?

Id: [0x000FCF4F]
You could always get another horse.

Id: [0x000FCF50]
These things cost drachmae, you know.

Id: [0x000FCF5C]
I feel the same about my Phobos.

Id: [0x000FCF5E]
The gods don't have work in store for you here, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FCF60]
I need to see that you're marked for greatness before I can give you divine work, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FCF62]
Come back when you've proven yourself to the gods.

Id: [0x000FCF7A]
I'm feeling helpful. What's happening?

Id: [0x000FCF7C]
All right. You have my attention.

Id: [0x000FCF7E]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x000FCF83]
If you're paying, I'm listening.

Id: [0x000FCF85]
Keep talking.

Id: [0x000FCF87]
If you have drachmae, I have time to listen.

Id: [0x000FCF8C]
What's happened?

Id: [0x000FCF8E]
What do you need?

Id: [0x000FCF90]
Depends on what you're asking for.

Id: [0x000FCF94]
Who are you again? Doesn't matter. Come back when you need no introduction.

Id: [0x000FCF96]
We'll talk once you've earned your place in the world, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FCF98]
I deal with change-makers only, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x000FCF9A]
Hm? Come back when you've earned your place in the Greek world.

Id: [0x000FCF9C]
Who are you? Never mind. Come back when I don't need to ask such silly questions.

Id: [0x000FCF9E]
Come back when you've made a name for yourself.

Id: [0x000FCFCC]
We did everything together. He'd do <i>anything </i>for me - even without the promise of a carrot.

Id: [0x000FD047]
Hello again.

Id: [0x000FD04E]
Have you decided to help me after all?

Id: [0x000FD050]
I have questions.

Id: [0x000FD057]
Drachmae you don't have, by the sound of it.

Id: [0x000FD058]
He sounds like a true friend.

Id: [0x000FD059]
I need him back to cart my shipments. Once Drakon finds out I can't get him his oil, I'm as good as dead.

Id: [0x000FD05A]
Drakon? The Boetian champion?

Id: [0x000FD05B]
He's my biggest customer.

Id: [0x000FD060]
Incredible!

Id: [0x000FD06D]
You must be Spyro. Let's get you back home.

Id: [0x000FD073]
Save me from Drakon's wrath. Find my Spyro - please.

Id: [0x000FD07F]
He's all right. Not a hair touched on his mane.

Id: [0x000FD080]
And Drakon will still get his shipment of oil, won't he Spyro? We'll take it up the mountain, and fill his halls with our wonderful, flammable oil.

Id: [0x000FD081]
You've made Spyro a happy horse, <i>misthios</i>. And me a happy man.

Id: [0x000FD083]
<i>Spyro.</i> Oh, I thought I'd never see you again.

Id: [0x000FD095]
I don't want to kill Deianeira. I want Astra killed instead.

Id: [0x000FD097]
I'll kill Astra for you.

Id: [0x000FD098]
When they killed Abreas, they took a necklace I made him. I want it back.

Id: [0x000FD099]
Your vengeance will have to wait.

Id: [0x000FD0A0]
I'm sorry. Spyro won't be coming home.

Id: [0x000FD0A1]
Impossible. He has to.

Id: [0x000FD0A2]
I know it might be painful, but the only thing left to do is get a new one and move on.

Id: [0x000FD0A3]
You were indifferent to my suffering. I knew I shouldn't trust you with Spyro's life. This is my fault.

Id: [0x000FD0A5]
Well? Did you see Spyro?

Id: [0x000FD0A6]
I'll see your vengeance delivered.

Id: [0x000FD0A7]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Deianeira and her mercenaries have a camp east of the Orchomenos. You'll likely find Astra there.

Id: [0x000FD0AA]
Boeotia is large, and I don't have time to waste.

Id: [0x000FD0AB]
Of course. The camp lies on the northern shoreline of Lake Kopais.

Id: [0x000FD0AC]
Why not simply kill Deianeira?

Id: [0x000FD0AD]
She and Astra are very close, as close as Abreas and I were. I want her to feel the same pain, the same loss. Death would be too easy for her.

Id: [0x000FD0B2]
I searched Astra's body, but found no necklace.

Id: [0x000FD0B6]
Did you... Did Astra have my brother's necklace?

Id: [0x000FD0B7]
Here.

Id: [0x000FD0B8]
Thank you, mercenary. I made this for my brother when he was younger, so he would never be alone hunting or fighting.

Id: [0x000FD0B9]
Now I need something from you.

Id: [0x000FD0BA]
Anything.

Id: [0x000FD0BB]
I need to be going.

Id: [0x000FD0BC]
Thank you for bringing me justice.

Id: [0x000FD0BD]
Gods be with you.

Id: [0x000FD0C4]
Hmph. You seem a little soft, but I guess you'll do. You looking for work?

Id: [0x000FD0C5]
Ha! You're fiesty enough! Let's put you to work.

Id: [0x000FD0C6]
Ha! Would a godly bird really travel with the likes of you? [beat]Let's find out what just what you're made of. Up for a challenge?

Id: [0x000FD0C7]
Hm. We'll see. Let's put your skills to the test and see if you are worthy of his company.

Id: [0x000FD0CB]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x000FD0CC]
I suppose I'll try and get back to living... alone.

Id: [0x000FD0D9]
Huh? Enough chatter! Let's put you to work.

Id: [0x000FD0DA]
[laughs]Me neither. [sighs]Anyway, you looking for work?

Id: [0x000FD0DB]
My problem is the <i>last </i>ingredient. I need to buy the rarest herb in Boeotia from my herbalist, but she hasn't come to Thebes in a while.

Id: [0x000FD0DC]
Good to know.

Id: [0x000FD0DD]
I need to know where Deianeira is.

Id: [0x000FD0DE]
If she wasn't at the camp, she is likely at the cave of the oracle, at the heart of Reborn Hill.

Id: [0x000FD0FA]
Hm. Fated more like. Much like you are fated to help me.

Id: [0x000FD0FB]
And yet you are one yourself, Eagle Bearer. But maybe I can interest you in some work.

Id: [0x000FD0FC]
Ha! I like you already. Now, are you ready to do the work of the gods?

Id: [0x000FD0FD]
Indeed. Now, are you interested in doing some divine work?

Id: [0x000FD0FE]
Hmph, whenever you're ready to get down to business, I've got work that needs doing.

Id: [0x000FD0FF]
Fine. I suppose I can't be too picky. There's a lot of work that needs to be done around here.

Id: [0x000FD13C]
Ha! Scared, are you? Fine, I'll let you off easy. We need to get to work, anyway.

Id: [0x000FD13D]
Ha! I need more men with your fervor. Interested in doing some work for me?

Id: [0x000FD13E]
That it is, my dear misthios, but enough talk. Are you prepared to make your fortune?

Id: [0x000FD13F]
A bronze bed is easy to sleep on, I can assure you. Anyway, interested in making some drachmae?

Id: [0x000FD142]
Drakon will be easy to defeat without his armor. Better find that herb, then.

Id: [0x000FD14F]
This is the last place I expected to find you.

Id: [0x000FD150]
I left Stentor with the greatest responsibility a man could carry. I couldn't leave him to face it alone.

Id: [0x000FD151]
How thoughtful.

Id: [0x000FD15B]
I never thought I'd see you again. What have you been doing?

Id: [0x000FD15C]
You made me realize in Megaris that I lost my honor long ago. There's no way to go back and make it up to you, but I can fulfill my promise to Stentor now.

Id: [0x000FD168]
[&breath]Alexios, [&breath]listen to me. [&breath]You are my brother. I tried to protect you once, and I failed. I will not fail again.

Id: [0x000FD16A]
I tried saving you once, and it cost me everything. [&breath]But you, you are beyond saving. You will not survive the mountain this time.

Id: [0x000FD16C]
Ah, then it seems there were two reasons we were fated to meet - that we're kindred spirits and that I have just the job for you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x000FD16D]
A debate for another time, I think. For now, there is divine work to be done.

Id: [0x000FD16E]
You've more than earned your citizenship. Sparta owes you thanks and releases your home unto you.

Id: [0x000FD174]
Leaving Stentor to pick up the pieces in Megaris was a mistake.

Id: [0x000FD175]
I couldn't stay, not after what happened. I wasn't fit for command.

Id: [0x000FD176]
Neither is Stentor, but he isn't running from it.

Id: [0x000FD17C]
You came all this way to help Stentor? Good. He needs it.

Id: [0x000FD17D]
It's about time I started protecting those I care about.

Id: [0x000FD17E]
You're right.

Id: [0x000FD180]
You've changed so much.

Id: [0x000FD181]
This is who I've always been. You just weren't there to see it.

Id: [0x000FD182]
I'll never be able to change that, but I can do something now for someone who needs me. There are things Stentor must hear to succeed.

Id: [0x000FD183]
You've done enough damage. You should stay away.

Id: [0x000FD18D]
True enough. Now, let's put you to work. Ready to serve the people?

Id: [0x000FD18E]
Ah, but I am practical, my dear misthios, and there's lot to be done around here... If you're ready to make your mark.

Id: [0x000FD195]
Seems you've chosen to die a fool, then. Though maybe I can change your mind... Let's talk business.

Id: [0x000FD196]
I like your spirit. Why don't we talk business?

Id: [0x000FD19D]
Ha! Tell yourself you were born strong all day long... But I sense more than a few skeletons in your closet. [beat]You know, I could use an associate with a little edge. Looking for work?

Id: [0x000FD19E]
Only to fools who can't withstand it. [beat]You don't strike me as foolish though... Looking for work?

Id: [0x000FD1AF]
Your elders had both her children thrown off a cliff! They tore our whole family apart.

Id: [0x000FD1B1]
But the minute she thought Sparta was in danger, she came back. She brought us both back to help. How dare you accuse her of not <i>caring!</i>

Id: [0x000FD1B2]
I've heard your grandfather couldn't control his temper either.

Id: [0x000FD1B3]
Then blame me.

Id: [0x000FD1B5]
I killed the elder. I started all of this. So if you want someone to prove their loyalty, it should be me.

Id: [0x000FD1BE]
I'm not sure if I should congratulate you on your honesty or punish you for the crime you've just confessed.

Id: [0x000FD1DF]
We worship a little differently where I'm from. We don't kill a man for what he believes. We show respect.

Id: [0x000FD1E1]
The world is full of strife, yes, but also love. Embrace it - embrace <i>me</i>, and I will personally introduce you all to my family... the gods.

Id: [0x000FD1E4]
Respect is for the gods, not those who pretend to be them.

Id: [0x000FD1EA]
I saw Empedokles risk his greatest <i>treasure -</i> running naked through a military camp - and showed no fear. There is <i>clearly</i> something... special about this man.

Id: [0x000FD1EE]
If being locked naked in a cell makes someone a god, the pantheon would be overflowing.

Id: [0x000FD1F0]
Maybe Empedokles is a god, maybe he's not. All I know is that he doesn't beat young men to death.

Id: [0x000FD1FA]
Brothers, sisters of Kythera: join me.

Id: [0x000FD214]
Even a god won't work for free.

Id: [0x000FD215]
Of course! What else would I spend my drachmae on? Clothes?!

Id: [0x000FD217]
Of course, why would you?

Id: [0x000FD21C]
You've made no friends today.

Id: [0x000FD21D]
Who needs friends when I have the gods?

Id: [0x000FD247]
No need to thank me for your rescue, your drachmae is thanks enough -

Id: [0x000FD248]
Me, thank <i>you</i>?! Here? With no audience? No, no, no, my heroic friend - the stage is not set!

Id: [0x000FD249]
Our performance is missing that most vital ingredient: <i>an audience!</i>

Id: [0x000FD24A]
Meet me by my personal statue so we may continue.

Id: [0x000FD271]
They're gone, you can come out now.

Id: [0x000FD276]
By the gods. They killed Episthenes.

Id: [0x000FD278]
They must have really wanted something from you.

Id: [0x000FD27D]
Don't. Don't.

Id: [0x000FD27E]
Then get her out of the house. You die if she doesn't.

Id: [0x000FD27F]
The farm's <i>ours.</i>

Id: [0x000FD28B]
I tried to get to him in time.

Id: [0x000FD28C]
He was a good man with a soft heart. He loved our herbs like they were his children.

Id: [0x000FD28E]
Thank you, misthios. If you hadn't intervened we'd surely be dead.

Id: [0x000FD28F]
The farm. It's one of the few untouched by the war. Herbs aren't free, you know. They'd uproot 'em and sell 'em.

Id: [0x000FD294]
Speaking of herbs, that's why I'm here. I need to buy one for a man named Melanippos. Says he knows you.

Id: [0x000FD295]
That troublemaker still wants to make the love potion?

Id: [0x000FD296]
As for Pausanias, it would be wise to deal with him as soon as possible.

Id: [0x000FD297]
Then what's your plan?

Id: [0x000FD298]
Well, he'll have it his way. I can sell you the herb he needs.

Id: [0x000FD2A1]
Who could forget? The girl who died to save her brother. Such a tragedy. An innocent child, put to death because of an ancient, merciless law.

Id: [0x000FD2A3]
In any case, Sparta was weakened by losing you. Losing you both.

Id: [0x000FD2A5]
Oh I agree. But King Archidamos? If he could carve Spartan law across the chests of every citizen he would.

Id: [0x000FD2AE]
I saved your farm. I feel like that deserves some gratitude.

Id: [0x000FD2AF]
I have to make a living, don't I?

Id: [0x000FD2B0]
I think exchanging herbs for your life is a fair trade.

Id: [0x000FD2B2]
Fine, here.

Id: [0x000FD2B4]
Tell Melanippos to let it really soak in.

Id: [0x000FD2B6]
While I'm thankful for your help, I didn't ask for it. I can't be giving my herbs away for free in such trying times.

Id: [0x000FD2BF]
I shouldn't have to pay anything. I risked my life for you.

Id: [0x000FD2C1]
I never asked you to, but suit yourself. You won't find anyone else with this herb in Boeotia.

Id: [0x000FD2C9]
Fine, here's the drachmae.

Id: [0x000FD2CB]
Thank you. I appreciate the gesture.

Id: [0x000FD2CE]
On second thought, you did save Episthenes and me.

Id: [0x000FD2E8]
<i>Two </i>innocent children were put to their deaths that day.

Id: [0x000FD2EA]
Kassandra, enough!

Id: [0x000FD2EB]
You both have.

Id: [0x000FD31C]
Ancient and merciless? Most Spartans live and die by these laws. But you sound more [beat]progressive.

Id: [0x000FD342]
I killed an elder. Sparta didn't find that very innocent.

Id: [0x000FD4DD]
And you sound like you've been rubbing elbows with Athenians.

Id: [0x000FD4DE]
I've been to a symposium or two.

Id: [0x000FD9B4]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x000FDA2F]
Shut the fuck up.

Id: [0x000FDA30]
My hands are empty - have <i>pity</i>!

Id: [0x000FDA54]
At least they didn't get my battle arm.

Id: [0x000FDA55]
I'm happy it got to you in time.

Id: [0x000FDA7A]
So Kleon's here.

Id: [0x000FDA7B]
For once he plans to fight <i>with </i>his men.

Id: [0x000FDA7C]
He was disgraced in Athens. He needs to win back their respect.

Id: [0x000FDA7D]
A chance at retribution.

Id: [0x000FDA7E]
Can't let that happen, can we?

Id: [0x000FDA7F]
He's close - somewhere outside the city walls. He intends to take Amphipolis.

Id: [0x000FDA80]
Olympics? Fuck yeah! I'm gonna be the champion...

Id: [0x000FDA94]
Tell me what happened after the battle.

Id: [0x000FDA95]
They found me wounded. I was taken back to Sparta and given time to heal. My leg won't be the same, but they didn't kill me.

Id: [0x000FDA96]
Kleon's here. We need to move.

Id: [0x000FDA98]
Enough. Get on my ship, or I'll drag you there.

Id: [0x000FDA99]
Don't yell at me! I was coming anyway.

Id: [0x000FDA9A]
[&grunt]Maláka!

Id: [0x000FDA9B]
I have something for you. A certain oil...

Id: [0x000FDA9C]
My oil? Oh, I could kiss you!

Id: [0x000FDA9D]
There always is.

Id: [0x000FDAAF]
Are you excited for the Games, Kassandra?

Id: [0x000FDAB0]
Sparta! Woo!

Id: [0x000FDAB1]
Stand warrior stand - feet firmly planted, even in sand. Our spirits soar on high, for a Spartan never truly dies.

Id: [0x000FDAB2]
Huh?

Id: [0x000FDAB3]
It's a poem. A Spartan poem...

Id: [0x000FDAB4]
Oh. [beat]SPARTA! Woo!

Id: [0x000FDABE]
Nike! I'm gonna win!

Id: [0x000FDAC1]
You think vengeance will dull your pain? Trust me, it won't.

Id: [0x000FDAE7]
We're here today because he defied those laws.

Id: [0x000FDAE8]
He did, and he lost his head for it.

Id: [0x000FDB05]
Something else, dear Kassie?

Id: [0x000FDB11]
Where do I go to fight in the pankration?

Id: [0x000FDB12]
The stadium in Olympia, naturally. I do love a good rough and tumble.

Id: [0x000FDB14]
You know people die in these events.

Id: [0x000FDB15]
What else goes on apart from the pankration?

Id: [0x000FDB19]
I need that wreath for Sparta. If it means I have to compete, so be it.

Id: [0x000FDB1D]
I will, father. [beat]I will make you proud.

Id: [0x000FDB32]
And... you want me to compete in the Olympics?

Id: [0x000FDB44]
There's javelin, which - of course - you know how that works. The athlete <i>thrusts </i>the long, smooth spear forward...

Id: [0x000FDB48]
But why have me kill them?

Id: [0x000FDB49]
For years the <i>krypteia</i> kept the peace between the helots and Spartans. Troublemakers and threats among the helots were... dealt with.

Id: [0x000FDBFC]
Testing the Staging Generation.

Id: [0x000FDBFE]
First Participant!

Id: [0x000FDBFF]
Second Participant!

Id: [0x000FDC00]
Third Participant!

Id: [0x000FDC02]
Now only two participants, I am the first.

Id: [0x000FDC03]
I am the second, RIP Phoibe!

Id: [0x000FDC06]
Thanks for chatting with me, it was a pleasure!

Id: [0x000FDC07]
No, thank you for your time! I am glad that we were able to part from a @Gameplay dialogue haha!.

Id: [0x000FDC7D]
He is no god at all! Your words are an affront to the will of Aphrodite!

Id: [0x000FDCF6]
There's nothing to be nervous about. We'll be there cheering you on.

Id: [0x000FDCF7]
But... what if I don't win?

Id: [0x000FDCF8]
They'll build statues and write poems about you... But first, we need to get you there.

Id: [0x000FDD23]
Welcome to the Olympic Games! The party has officially begun.

Id: [0x000FDD24]
Alkibiades? I'm surprised you're... wearing clothes.

Id: [0x000FDD25]
The day is young, little goat.

Id: [0x000FDD29]
Are you here to compete, Alkibiades?

Id: [0x000FDD2A]
Of course. I enjoy other physical exertions from time to time.

Id: [0x000FDD2C]
Sure.

Id: [0x000FDD30]
Who do you think will win the most wreaths this year?

Id: [0x000FDD31]
Athens will surely <i>rise</i> to the occasion.

Id: [0x000FDD32]
We've haven't come all this way to stand on the dock.

Id: [0x000FDD33]
I say Messenia.

Id: [0x000FDD34]
Has the sea air addled your mind? Sparta always takes pankration and many others too.

Id: [0x000FDD35]
You might know a lot about the past, but you know little about the future.

Id: [0x000FDD37]
Quite right. Should you ever need a personal sparring partner...

Id: [0x000FDD38]
You? A skinny little Athenian? I'm the champion, or gonna be. SPARTA!

Id: [0x000FDD39]
[&laughs][giggling][/&laughs]A pity your brain isn't as big as your muscles.

Id: [0x000FDD45]
Come, dear Kassie - show them what you're made of!

Id: [0x000FDD8B]
What you say is true. But I swear by the two gods my intentions are pure.

Id: [0x000FDD98]
My thanks.

Id: [0x000FDDA7]
Listen up. I'm only going to say this once.

Id: [0x000FDDA9]
[&groan][groans][/&groan]This village stinks like a pig's asshole.

Id: [0x000FDDAB]
Everyone shut up, or you'll eat steel.

Id: [0x000FDDAD]
I'd be more than happy to bash your teeth in if you don't settle down.

Id: [0x000FDDB3]
Astra's dead. You have your vengeance.

Id: [0x000FDDB4]
I thought I'd feel relieved.

Id: [0x000FDDB7]
I wanted something to remember him by.

Id: [0x000FDDB8]
You got your vengeance - it should be enough. I still need the information about Deianeira.

Id: [0x000FDDBA]
No Spartan got off easy. I was captured and brought to Athens.

Id: [0x000FDDBB]
Athens? That rubs salt into the wound. Proof there's still work to be done.

Id: [0x000FDDDF]
You’re Testikles?! The same Testikles I went out drinking with last season, the one who made advances on my wife... and brother?

Id: [0x000FDDE0]
[&groan]Er…[/&groan] The diet and training is... transformative.

Id: [0x000FDDE2]
Obviously...

Id: [0x000FDE2A]
[&laughs]Last time I saw you, I had to pull you out of a burning warehouse.

Id: [0x000FDE31]
Stentor? [&scoff]I knew I should have killed him on the beach.

Id: [0x000FDFE8]
[&laughs]That's not how I remember it.

Id: [0x00106643]
No one will save you this time -

Id: [0x00106665]
I know, <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x00106666]
From the moment I first held you, I knew. You were sent by the gods to protect this world... and you did.

Id: [0x00106667]
From the moment I first held you, I knew. You're sent by the gods to protect this world, and you did.

Id: [0x00106697]
No!

Id: [0x00106871]
I'm not getting caught without armor twice today.

Id: [0x001068FF]
I've already paid more than you could ever know.

Id: [0x00106906]
You're home now.

Id: [0x00106908]
[crying]I've done terrible things.

Id: [0x00106909]
We all have, Alexios.

Id: [0x0010690B]
I'm a fast learner! You grow grapes on the vine, then you get some wine!

Id: [0x00106940]
A decoy. Why am I not surprised?

Id: [0x00106942]
We had a skirmish with the enemy here not too long ago. We beat the Spartans back, but they haven't retaliated. They always retaliate.

Id: [0x00106943]
They're plotting something.

Id: [0x00106944]
We just got word they're recruiting sellswords and stockpiling weapons. A battle's brewing. We need to do something.

Id: [0x00106946]
I don't give a shit what you've been through.

Id: [0x00106948]
Stentor, it's done.

Id: [0x00106949]
How many times do I have to tell you -

Id: [0x00106955]
So? You're a soldier. Protect them.

Id: [0x00106957]
<i>You</i> against a band of raiders? I'm sure you can fight, but you don't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00106959]
I would at least try, if our general hadn't ordered us to keep our post. He may not care about the villagers. [beat]But I do.

Id: [0x0010695F]
Raiders have been robbing anyone traveling the roads ahead. The villagers are too scared to leave their homes.

Id: [0x0010696D]
I was born a poet, not a soldier. The general's been good - he lets me write when I'm on watch. Even gives me papyrus. But last night, our camp was raided by bandits. Now my writing's missing. All of it.

Id: [0x00106989]
Oh <i>misthios</i>, I need to prove how much I adore the beautiful girl betrothed to me. Something romantic. Something grand.

Id: [0x0010698D]
Er... send flowers?

Id: [0x0010698F]
You realize I'm a mercenary, don't you? We usually solve problems that require, you know, fists. And blades. That kind of thing.

Id: [0x00106991]
I've been drafted. We leave in the morning, but I need to get this fine jewelry to her.

Id: [0x001069AB]
I have the Spartan forces' battle plans.

Id: [0x001069AC]
How'd you manage that?

Id: [0x001069AD]
I infiltrated the general's encampment, but I can't finish this on my own. My commander needs these battle plans.

Id: [0x001069B2]
Headed to the house of Odysseus on a tiny boat... Let's try not to piss off Poseidon, shall we?

Id: [0x001069C9]
This war just drags on and on, <i>misthios</i>. I have a family and a daughter I've never met.

Id: [0x001069CF]
Then you have more reason to fight than ever. Raise your sword and shield in their name.

Id: [0x001069D0]
Fight? You've seen what we're up against. I do that, and I'll <i>die</i> in their name, too.

Id: [0x001069D2]
We're all living without our families.

Id: [0x001069D3]
For now. But I'm not letting my daughter grow up without her father. Not like how I did.

Id: [0x001069D5]
A local politician has been calling for my commander's head after a small... misunderstanding about military funds. It’s a minor threat, but [beat]one that must be removed.

Id: [0x00106AE7]
It'll be a disaster, a disaster I tell you!

Id: [0x00106AE8]
I'm no actor or poet, Aristophanes.

Id: [0x00106B19]
Of course.

Id: [0x00106B1F]
If I had a boat, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

Id: [0x00106B20]
A shame. It's too far of a swim I'm afraid, even for you.

Id: [0x00106B21]
I'll find one.

Id: [0x00106B23]
How do you know he's missing?

Id: [0x00106B24]
He never misses a rehearsal... unless he's drunk, or with a woman... or a man.

Id: [0x00106BE1]
Please. Have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x00106BE2]
Take pity on me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00106BE7]
Thank the gods you were here. You saved me once, <i>misthios</i>. Maybe you could help me again.

Id: [0x00106BED]
They didn't stand a chance against you! Serves them right for picking on an easy target. I don't have much to offer, but I still need your help.

Id: [0x00106BF5]
I was trapped here for days. Please, you've already done so much... but would you help me again?

Id: [0x00106CF6]
Me? Are you sure? I would be honored! Praise the gods.

Id: [0x00106CF9]
I've never sailed in my life. I don't have much, but this is my home, <i>misthios</i>. I could never leave.

Id: [0x00106CFC]
Thank you. For everything. Please, this isn't much, but take it.

Id: [0x00106CFD]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Take this, it's yours.

Id: [0x00106D01]
Tell me you're joking. I trusted you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00106D02]
I thought the gods had finally shone their light down on me. But you're just one more way they've cursed me.

Id: [0x00106D0C]
Please change your mind.

Id: [0x00106D0F]
Come back! You have to help me.

Id: [0x00106D5C]
And why is that?

Id: [0x00106D5D]
The seas are much more dangerous, I'm afraid. War is coming, and the Wolf is on the wrong side.

Id: [0x00106F80]
I wish you would have told me that <i>before </i>they hit me. But that's beside the point. You bought a vineyard, Markos? A <i>vineyard?!</i>

Id: [0x00106F83]
Why not? I like wine, you like wine. Everybody likes wine. Everybody buys wine! Why not from me?

Id: [0x00106F85]
It's that simple, is it?

Id: [0x00106F86]
You know me better than to think I don’t have a plan. Markos <i>always</i> has a plan!

Id: [0x00106F87]
All right. Then do you have the money you owe me?

Id: [0x00106F98]
You made it.

Id: [0x00106F99]
Of course I did.

Id: [0x00106F9A]
Barnabas was ready to go after you again.

Id: [0x00106FA7]
Kleon will have to do more than that to stop me.

Id: [0x00106FA8]
We've begun working on a plan to take down Kleon.

Id: [0x00106FD3]
Finally, someone who's willing to have some fun. I'm not sure how many more times I can take Sokrates rejecting me.

Id: [0x00106FF2]
Yes?

Id: [0x00107019]
Deimos... The Forge...

Id: [0x0010701B]
Hey! Stop! That's my stuff!

Id: [0x00107024]
All right, all right! I'll pay you! Just stop!

Id: [0x0010702B]
I knew I let you stay in the Animus too long. Your vitals are crashing.

Id: [0x0010702D]
I admit, that could be an incredible find. But right now, I'm the doctor, and I take care of you.

Id: [0x00107030]
Now get some rest before you go back to Kassandra.

Id: [0x00107034]
Phoibe slept here again, poor kid. No place to call home.

Id: [0x00107050]
I think he's had enough.

Id: [0x00107053]
Yeah, was business... Oh, look at you!

Id: [0x00107059]
I'm here for his employer, Aristophanes.

Id: [0x0010705A]
So? He's not working now.

Id: [0x0010705B]
Yes! I's not working... I like him though. Aristophanes, funny man... buts opinions. Told him it's dangerous.

Id: [0x0010705C]
That it is.

Id: [0x0010705D]
I need him sober and rested.

Id: [0x0010705F]
I'm just here for Thespis. He's drunk, and I need to get him home.

Id: [0x00107060]
What are you, his <i>mater</i>?

Id: [0x00107061]
Let's say extended family.

Id: [0x00107063]
I don't think you understand the situation. Commander Rhexenor's orders are he's not to leave.

Id: [0x00107065]
I saids I'd stay... Don't wants trouble.

Id: [0x0010706E]
If you don't want to leave with your heads stuffed up your asses, you'll go now.

Id: [0x00107072]
Give me Thespis, and I'll give you something in return. I'm sure we can come to an arrangement.

Id: [0x00107079]
You'll regret that.

Id: [0x0010707B]
Get going - from your smell, you already know where the goat pens are. I'm sure they miss you.

Id: [0x0010707D]
[&ah][[Maaa!]][/&ah]

Id: [0x00107080]
We'll be seeing you, misthios. The Commander's not a man to be messed with.

Id: [0x00107085]
Take this and get out of my sight.

Id: [0x00107088]
Do you think we're farmers that can be bought for beans? Take your money and stick it up your ass.

Id: [0x0010708E]
Here, for your troubles. I'll look after him now.

Id: [0x00107092]
Huh, a fool and his drachmae... Very well, you won't see us again.

Id: [0x00107099]
...And then I saids to him, if this is your wife, why did she charge me?!

Id: [0x0010709B]
I'd loves to stay, but my cup's drained, and I'm to perform tomorrow!

Id: [0x0010709D]
Another drink! Come, one more tale. The night is young...

Id: [0x001070A2]
The mint and chamomile's almost dry. I can stop drinking puddle water.

Id: [0x001070B7]
No time to rest. Abstergo goons could be tracking us down right now.

Id: [0x001070B8]
And the rest of us will be ready for them. If you burn out here, our mission will be done.

Id: [0x001070BD]
Eugh, that smells lovely. Probably time I emptied it.

Id: [0x001070C2]
Markos knew this would serve young Kassandra well. Can't imagine fighting the Cyclops's thugs with it now.

Id: [0x001070C5]
And what business is it of yours, <i>friend</i>?

Id: [0x001070CB]
If you insist. But only because I've got work to do on the outside.

Id: [0x001070CC]
Please, just clear your head. The last thing we need is a cell leader suffering from the bleeding effect and spearing us because we're Hittites or Thracians.

Id: [0x001070D4]
I could always use a bit more fun.

Id: [0x001070D5]
I knew it! Let the walls sing with the echoes of our passion as all tension melts from our bodies.

Id: [0x001070E9]
Ah, that hurts! Stop, I'll pay you, stop!

Id: [0x001070EB]
By the gods, no! It's Thespis. My leading man is missing! A play with no star is no play at all.

Id: [0x001070F4]
Could be anything, then?

Id: [0x001070F5]
No, he knows how important this is. He wouldn't let me down... Something must be wrong!

Id: [0x001070F6]
You could just get another actor.

Id: [0x001070F7]
Oh, no. Thespis always draws a huge crowd for his performances.

Id: [0x001070FA]
We're in the middle of a war, Kleon is wreaking havoc across the land... and you want to have <i>fun</i>?

Id: [0x001070FB]
At least until I've spent every ounce of energy I can.

Id: [0x001070FC]
Spend it on something more useful, then.

Id: [0x00107106]
What's more useful than releasing some stress in a trying time?

Id: [0x00107109]
Another challenger. I hope you're more resilient than the last one.

Id: [0x00107116]
So where would I find him?

Id: [0x00107117]
Thespis usually doesn't go far from his home. You'd best start there.

Id: [0x00107118]
I'll go stretch my legs. Too bad we don't have access to the Abstergo gym anymore, eh?

Id: [0x00107119]
Membership cost too much.

Id: [0x0010711A]
Which I've modified to within a millimeter of its digital life. It's an Animus console prototype, Brahman variant, with the I/O capacities pushed to their max. Ultra-portable, with more calculating power than NASA and CERN combined.

Id: [0x0010711E]
Wait it out. He'll probably turn up.

Id: [0x0010711F]
This shouldn't take long. Prepare the show, and I'll be back as soon as I find him.

Id: [0x00107125]
What's so special about the play? Will your famous "Orange Ape" impression be making an appearance?

Id: [0x00107127]
So, what do you think of my new Animus?

Id: [0x00107128]
You mean, OUR new Animus? That's Abstergo equipment.

Id: [0x00107129]
Find Thespis - he must be at his house. The play cannot go on without my leading man!

Id: [0x00107145]
You <i>are</i> an interesting one. Now, take what you have learned and touch the symbols that reflect your choices.

Id: [0x0010714A]
Do you need something?

Id: [0x0010716E]
So I've met Herodotos, but I don't know much about him.

Id: [0x00107172]
I'll leave you to your work.

Id: [0x00107173]
If you need anything, just let me know.

Id: [0x0010717E]
What is always old and sometimes new; never sad, sometimes blue; never empty, but sometimes full; never pushes, always pulls?

Id: [0x00107185]
I can. He sure does talk a lot.

Id: [0x00107186]
Fascinating... Layla! Can you believe we're meeting Herodotos himself?

Id: [0x00107188]
The moon.

Id: [0x0010718D]
The sky.

Id: [0x0010718E]
Is there anything I can help you with?

Id: [0x00107192]
Never resting, never still; moving silently from hill to hill; it does not walk, run, or trot; all is cool where it is not.

Id: [0x00107195]
At night they come without being fetched, and by day they are lost without being stolen.

Id: [0x0010719C]
Most people would talk about justice or leaping across rooftops, but history's cool, too.

Id: [0x0010719D]
I've loved history since my grandpa told me stories about his grandpa back in Ireland. He was an adventurer and sailor. So I'm continuing the family tradition. I feel so lucky!

Id: [0x0010719E]
You make your own luck, remember?

Id: [0x0010719F]
The stories surrounding you don't do your charm justice, Eagle Bearer. But moving on, are you looking for work?

Id: [0x001071A0]
Enough that few try it these days. But down to business. Are you interested in work?

Id: [0x001071A1]
I could use someone intelligent like you on my team. Ready to get to work?

Id: [0x001071A2]
Ha, I like your spirit. Looking for work?

Id: [0x001071A6]
He's brilliant! His <i>Histories</i> are considered the foremost textbook of classical Greece. People have made their careers analyzing his words for some new perspective. To see him in his own world, walking in the <i>polis </i>and...

Id: [0x001071A7]
Sorry... but he's kind of a hero of mine.

Id: [0x001071A8]
You can fangirl all you want.

Id: [0x001071AD]
I have visual on HQ. No threats in view.

Id: [0x001071C6]
Smart. That's the side that wins. On that note, ready to get to work?

Id: [0x001071C7]
And accurate, too. Anyway, you looking for work?

Id: [0x001071C8]
Hmph. Good enough, I guess. Let's make use of you.

Id: [0x001071C9]
You're feisty, at least. Fine, let's put you to work.

Id: [0x001071CA]
Smart enough, I suppose. Let's put you to work.

Id: [0x001071CB]
Enough insolent chatter! Are you looking for work or not?

Id: [0x001071CE]
How's it going out there?

Id: [0x001071CF]
Well. No threats in view.

Id: [0x001071D0]
I'm glad we could work together again.

Id: [0x001071D1]
I believe our working methods are compatible.

Id: [0x001071D9]
And you as well, Eagle Bearer. We can certainly make good use of you.

Id: [0x001071DA]
Details, <i>misthios</i>. Moving on, let's put you to work.

Id: [0x001071DB]
Glad to see you concur, Eagle Bearer. I could certainly use more warriors of a similar mindset. Looking for work?

Id: [0x001071DC]
Well, I suppose a fighter's heart and a leader's heart are two different things. I could certainly use more fighters, though. Interested in work?

Id: [0x001071E3]
Just as someone like you needs to spill blood on the battlefield for people like me who don't have the stomach for war. Looking for work?

Id: [0x001071E4]
Oh, don't worry, <i>misthios</i>. We still need plenty of soldiers bloodied on the battlefield. We can certainly put you to work.

Id: [0x001071EE]
Very true. Now, are you interested in work?

Id: [0x001071EF]
Hm. Well, you don't have to agree with my cause to serve it, I suppose. I may have some work for you, if you're interested.

Id: [0x001071F0]
[Laughs]How right you are. Now, let's talk business.

Id: [0x001071F1]
There's no path to wealth, short or long, that doesn't leave you with a few enemies. Moving on, though, let's talk business.

Id: [0x001071F6]
It makes you stronger. Nothing more, nothing less. Now, let's see how strong pain has made you.

Id: [0x001071F7]
Neither birth or pain are remarkable. They're just life. But moving on, I want to put your skills to the test.

Id: [0x001071F8]
Ha! More true than you know, <i>misthios</i>. Now, let's see if you have what it takes to change the world.

Id: [0x001071F9]
Hm. Then I'm not sure you've got what it takes to work with me... Well, let's find out for certain.

Id: [0x001071FA]
Seems you'd prefer poor and foolish, then. Well, maybe I can convince you otherwise. Let's talk business.

Id: [0x001071FB]
So the great Eagle Bearer is brave and smart! I can certainly put you to good use.

Id: [0x00107234]
<i>Misthios</i>! I have a job for you.

Id: [0x0010723D]
What's going on?

Id: [0x00107249]
Wars cost both drachmae and lives.

Id: [0x0010724A]
I know the price. A war will be devastating, but in the end it's what's best for Gortyn.

Id: [0x0010724B]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0010724D]
We can't start a war on our own - we'll need supporters and soldiers.

Id: [0x00107250]
I'm the head of the boule council, and according to our code, after a war is lost, the council chooses our next leader... Me.

Id: [0x00107267]
I'll start the war for you. But first, I need more information.

Id: [0x0010726B]
This is your war - you fight it.

Id: [0x0010726C]
Our revolution won't be stopped. If you change your mind, come see me.

Id: [0x0010726E]
Will you help light the fires of revolution?

Id: [0x00107270]
Have you forgotten how to start the war?

Id: [0x00107272]
Where can I find the visiting herald?

Id: [0x00107273]
This "man of peace" stays at the Leader House at night, and wanders around Gortyn during the day. Kill him, and Gortyn will be blamed for his murder.

Id: [0x00107274]
I'll start this war for you. I hope you know what you're doing.

Id: [0x0010727F]
Destroying pots is punishable by death.

Id: [0x00107281]
Abuse is punishable by fine.

Id: [0x00107299]
Help! Somebody help me!

Id: [0x001072A0]
What's the problem?

Id: [0x001072A1]
My husband is missing. He went out fishing yesterday near Anaphi and hasn't returned.

Id: [0x001072A9]
Your husband is a poor fisherman if he can't take care of himself at sea.

Id: [0x001072AA]
He's a great fisherman. It's... it's something else -

Id: [0x001072AC]
You must miss him.

Id: [0x001072AD]
This is more than a wife missing her husband. I truly fear he's in danger.

Id: [0x001072AF]
In danger of what?

Id: [0x001072B0]
Pirates. They were spotted in the area recently. I told him it was too dangerous, but we needed the drachmae to pay Swordfish.

Id: [0x001072C4]
I'll look for your husband. Where should I start?

Id: [0x001072C8]
I've got other priorities.

Id: [0x001072C9]
No! He'll die without your help.

Id: [0x001072CB]
Will you rescue my husband from the pirates?

Id: [0x001072CD]
You have to save my husband from the pirates, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x001072D2]
Your wife sent me to find you.

Id: [0x001072D3]
Praise Poseidon. The pirates were waiting for high tide to attack.

Id: [0x001072DA]
I have support from the captain of the army and the region's upper class.

Id: [0x001072DB]
OK, then tell me your plan.

Id: [0x001072E9]
The likeness is terrifyingly good, don't you think?

Id: [0x001072EA]
Terrifying, yes. What did you need?

Id: [0x001072EB]
A god never needs <i>help</i>!

Id: [0x0010752A]
Who first? I'll let my spear do the talking.

Id: [0x0010752B]
...Uh, almost as epic, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0010752D]
Bring it in!

Id: [0x0010752E]
I- well, I wouldn't say no.

Id: [0x00107530]
...Though my request is <i>slightly</i> more epic than that.

Id: [0x00107532]
When I first arrived on Kythera, I was imprisoned for my beliefs. They stole my purple robe, and inside it is a very special disk... the key to my family estate.

Id: [0x00107533]
And you want this disk retrieved.

Id: [0x00107534]
Of course! The disk is a key! A key that opens a door to the gods themselves! This disk must be returned to me!

Id: [0x00107538]
...This disk?

Id: [0x00107539]
Praise ME and all my glorious glory, yes this is the disk! Only a god such as I could be so fortunate! <LF>

Id: [0x0010753F]
This disk sounds important. I'll find the man who stole it and return it to you.

Id: [0x00107541]
You said this robe-thief intercepted you at the dock. Do you know where he is now?

Id: [0x00107542]
He and his guards patrol along Kythera's main roads, but he enjoys roughing up recent arrivals.

Id: [0x00107546]
You're on your own, my omnipotent friend.

Id: [0x0010754E]
That human-shaped-shit still walks around in my purple robe, not knowing the value of the item inside...

Id: [0x00107561]
Purple dye might stink like rotten dog guts, but I'll be fucked if doesn't make me look like a god!<LF>

Id: [0x00107562]
Technically it's made from rotten snail guts, boss.

Id: [0x00107563]
...I'm wearing snail guts?

Id: [0x001075AE]
How could you -

Id: [0x001075AF]
You can't keep a god bound, and anyone who tried would die in the attempt.

Id: [0x001075B6]
Thank you for your support, <i>misthios</i>. In the future, my Empedoklites could use someone with your talents.

Id: [0x001075B7]
You think betraying Aphrodite will go unpunished?

Id: [0x001075B8]
You may not believe in my godliness, <i>misthios</i> - but I believe there's some god in you. And that... we can put to use.

Id: [0x001075BB]
But yes, please. I've been having trouble with my brothers and sisters.

Id: [0x001075BC]
Soon I will set sail for the Gulf of Korinth with my followers. Find us there and you will meet the gods for yourself! Perhaps you are ready now? The gods, of course, wait for no man...

Id: [0x001075F5]
Some stupid play. They don't tell me anything.

Id: [0x00107606]
[&laughs]Oh but you're much more than that, I'm sure!

Id: [0x00107607]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00107608]
When they forced my head under water, I prayed to the gods. And when they pulled it out, there you were!

Id: [0x00107614]
All of Kephallonia heard your prayers. I just happened to be closest.

Id: [0x00107615]
[&laughs]And you just happen to fight like Achilles while Zeus's eagle flies around your head!

Id: [0x00107619]
You called, and I answered.

Id: [0x0010761A]
Many claim to have blood of the gods in their veins. You're the first I actually believe.

Id: [0x0010761E]
I'm sorry, but you can't be trusted to live.

Id: [0x0010761F]
Get out of here, and count yourself lucky.

Id: [0x00107620]
They told me you had a cheerful bedside manner.

Id: [0x00107624]
You don't look like an actor, unless you're playing an Athenian guard.

Id: [0x00107626]
I - I...

Id: [0x0010762C]
I won't. But Thracians throw great parties.

Id: [0x0010762F]
Hush. I'm going to ask some questions, and you're going to answer.

Id: [0x00107630]
Yes.

Id: [0x00107631]
Tell me, what are you looking for?

Id: [0x0010763B]
But Commander Rhexenor...

Id: [0x0010763C]
What's your name?

Id: [0x0010763D]
Bulis.

Id: [0x0010763E]
Well Bulis, it's your choice whether you walk out of here. Do you understand?

Id: [0x00107643]
I should've stayed. Someone needed to stop Kleon.

Id: [0x00107645]
Fools look backwards in times like these, and you're no fool. For now, we work to save Mytilene.

Id: [0x0010764B]
What have you done with Thespis?

Id: [0x0010764D]
You're sure that's all?

Id: [0x0010764E]
I just follow the Commander's orders. I don't ask questions.

Id: [0x00107651]
War? With who?

Id: [0x00107652]
[&ahem]The entire Greek world is at each other's throats. What rock have you been hiding under, exactly?

Id: [0x00107653]
Kephallonia.

Id: [0x00107656]
When your job in Megaris is done, come find me at Pilgrim's Landing in Phokis.

Id: [0x0010765A]
And how do I know you're on the right side?

Id: [0x0010765B]
Because I'm the one paying you.

Id: [0x0010765C]
The wind.

Id: [0x0010765E]
It's the sun.

Id: [0x00107660]
The rain.

Id: [0x0010767F]
The moon.

Id: [0x00107681]
The stars.

Id: [0x00107683]
The sun.

Id: [0x001076A8]
The tide.

Id: [0x001076B8]
What is large, yet never grows; has roots that cannot be seen; and is taller than trees?

Id: [0x001076BA]
What can run, but never walks; has a mouth, but never talks; has a head, but never weeps; has a bed, but never sleeps?

Id: [0x001076BC]
In spring I am gay in handsome array; in summer more clothing I wear; when colder it grows, I fling off my clothes; and in winter quite naked appear.

Id: [0x00107704]
You're a goat.

Id: [0x00107706]
You're a mountain.

Id: [0x00107708]
You're a tree.

Id: [0x00107727]
Perhaps the fates brought us together after all. I'm in need of a ship and a crew.

Id: [0x00107728]
[&laughs]You saved my life! It would disgust the gods to not offer it in return.

Id: [0x00107736]
A mountain.

Id: [0x00107738]
A forest.

Id: [0x0010773A]
A city.

Id: [0x0010774D]
Thank you, but you can go no further... For I know [beat]true love!

Id: [0x0010774E]
I just need you ready to perform tomorrow.

Id: [0x00107754]
Of course, and I just need my muse... My love! I can't, I <i>won't</i> perform without her.

Id: [0x00107756]
You will perform.

Id: [0x00107757]
Uh-uh, not without Aikaterine, a divine name for a divine body... I mean being.

Id: [0x0010775B]
Those men in the tavern... Who were they?

Id: [0x0010775C]
Oh, the admirers. Harmless really... And I do like a man in uniform.

Id: [0x00107762]
If it means you'll do the play, I'll find your muse.

Id: [0x00107764]
A child.

Id: [0x00107766]
A river.

Id: [0x00107768]
A chariot.

Id: [0x00107771]
Your plan sounds promising...

Id: [0x00107772]
One of my students is posing as a guard at the akropolis. Apparently, Kleon is hiding something there, and has been meeting others in secret.

Id: [0x0010777A]
Where is it now?

Id: [0x0010777B]
Thanks to you, it's still in Sami Harbor where I left it.

What can bring back the dead; make you cry, make you laugh, make you young; is born in an instant, yet lasts a lifetime?

Id: [0x0010777E]
Some try to hide, some try to cheat; but time will show, we always will meet. Try as you might to guess my name; I promise you'll know, when you I do claim.

Id: [0x00107780]
This thing all things devour: birds, beasts, trees, flowers; gnaws iron, bites steel; grinds hard stones to meal; slays kings, ruins towns; and beats high mountains down.

Id: [0x00107793]
And I'm here to talk if you're feeling any confusion from the Animus.

Id: [0x00107794]
If we know where Kleon is, I should just kill him.

Id: [0x00107799]
Always the therapist.

Id: [0x0010779C]
Names.

Id: [0x0010779E]
Jokes.

Id: [0x001077A0]
Memories.

Id: [0x001077A5]
Going to enjoy this. I'll mess that pretty face right up.

Id: [0x001077A9]
No need for jealousy, just because your mother was a goat. Like mother, like kid.

Id: [0x001077AC]
Can't we come to some arrangement here?

Id: [0x001077B1]
[&breath]You're wasting my time.

Id: [0x001077B2]
I'd never make an arrangement with you!

Id: [0x001077B3]
What if the people don't turn against Kleon?

Id: [0x001077B4]
They will. I'll be speaking in front of them soon. With your help, we'll show them the man behind the facade.

Id: [0x001077B5]
Where do you need me to go?

Id: [0x001077B6]
To the western section of the Akropolis Sanctuary.

Id: [0x001077C2]
You need to die!

Id: [0x001077C8]
Time.

Id: [0x001077CA]
Nature.

Id: [0x001077CC]
Armies.

Id: [0x001077EA]
Time.

Id: [0x001077EC]
Death.

Id: [0x001077EE]
Destiny.

Id: [0x001077FF]
Of all the fucking phonies, Markos!

Id: [0x00107800]
Oh, she's just playing! It's a little game we have.

Id: [0x00107802]
She's the silent but deadly type!

Id: [0x00107805]
What did I tell you? She will leave no stone unturned.

Id: [0x00107808]
Are you still upset about our last run-in with Abstergo? I'm sorry, I didn't realize those hills in Quebec were so steep. But hey, you and your Yakuza reflexes saved us! [beat]Sorry, EX-Yakuza.

Id: [0x0010780A]
Of course, I'll return to the Animus, then follow the trail Herodotos left to find the staff. But there's so many possibilities, so many choices... There's no way to know which ones are right.

Id: [0x0010780C]
Thanks for watching our backs, Kiyoshi. I'll leave you to your work.

Id: [0x0010781F]
I'm alive, but without breath; I'm as cold in life as in death; I'm never thirsty, though I always drink.

Id: [0x00107821]
I create my lair with earthen string, and dispatch my prey with a biting sting.

Id: [0x00107823]
As small as your thumb, I am light in the air. You may hear me before you see me, but trust that I’m there.

Id: [0x0010782F]
I'll find something at the akropolis that Kleon won't be able to deny.

Id: [0x00107835]
A mosquito.

Id: [0x00107837]
A bumblebee.

Id: [0x00107839]
A hummingbird.

Id: [0x00107842]
I'll be quick.

Id: [0x00107844]
Anything else you can tell me about where to look?

Id: [0x00107845]
What I know is Kleon's always loved the Statue of Athena.

Id: [0x00107846]
Sounds like a good place to start.

Id: [0x0010784B]
Muse, huh!

Id: [0x0010784D]
Doctor's orders, Layla. Gotta stay out of the Animus for a while. Besides, there's more to learn out <i>here</i>.

Id: [0x0010784F]
I've got what I need. I'm ready to go back to the Animus.

Id: [0x00107851]
You're a fish.

Id: [0x00107853]
You're a crocodile.

Id: [0x00107855]
You're a jellyfish.

Id: [0x0010785B]
You have more questions?

Id: [0x0010785C]
[&breath]I sometimes wonder if leaving Kephallonia was a good idea.

Id: [0x0010785E]
A wasp.

Id: [0x00107860]
A spider.

Id: [0x00107862]
A snake.

Id: [0x00107868]
I should check my e-mail.

Id: [0x0010786B]
Too bad we had to leave before we could drink some more <i>caribou</i>.

Id: [0x0010786F]
Bwaah?

Id: [0x00107873]
Looks Third Echelon. Or is it Fourth?

Id: [0x00107877]
The center of the universe, circa 400 BCE.

Id: [0x0010787B]
I wonder if the Frye Twins would still recognize London... A rooftop's still a rooftop.

Id: [0x00107882]
Hmm, not my usual type. Too many muscles, but if you've got the drachmae, we can come to an arrangement.

Id: [0x00107883]
Where can I find the Commander?

Id: [0x00107885]
I thought you were Thespis's great love?

Id: [0x00107886]
That is love, this is commerce. So what are you into?

Id: [0x00107887]
No, Thespis told me to find you.

Id: [0x00107888]
Well, I'm not giving discounts to his friends if that's what you're thinking.

Id: [0x00107889]
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

Id: [0x0010788A]
Bring me back his <i>little sword</i>, as proof!

Id: [0x0010788B]
Can you describe him?

Id: [0x0010788C]
He wears one of those big stupid helms... makes up for other areas.

Id: [0x0010788D]
In the barracks across the street, to the north. The girls have to visit him there when he wants servicing - doesn't have the stamina to come down here.

Id: [0x001078C2]
That's all I wanted to know.

Id: [0x001078C5]
I know he can't be dead. His little soldiers are still here rutting away without a care.

Id: [0x001078CD]
Why did you come here and leave my mother and me in Sparta?

Id: [0x001078CE]
I was never going to raise you. Our duty was to continue our ancient bloodline and ensure there was someone strong enough to do what was necessary when the time came.

Id: [0x001078CF]
You could have brought us here with you.

Id: [0x001078D0]
And you would have been unprepared.

Id: [0x001078D1]
If you've been here all these years, how did you meet my mother?

Id: [0x001078D2]
We are both descendants of the people who built this place, just like you. We knew that we had an obligation to preserve our lineage.

Id: [0x001078D3]
That's when you agreed to make me.

Id: [0x001078D4]
In a manner of speaking, yes.

Id: [0x001078DE]
Please tell me you have news of Thespis?

Id: [0x001078FB]
But you're his muse?

Id: [0x001078FC]
Commander Rhexenor has made it clear it would cost me my life if I were to associate with Thespis right now.

Id: [0x001078FD]
No, Thespis wants you to go to him. He needs you to help him perform tomorrow.

Id: [0x001078FE]
Thespis does love to perform, but he'll be doing it without me this time.

Id: [0x0010790B]
He's fine, and he'll be fit to perform your play tomorrow.

Id: [0x0010790C]
Oh, thank the gods. I know what actors can be like.

Id: [0x0010790F]
Athenians' lives are too complicated. I would rather be a farmer than work in the theater.

Id: [0x00107910]
True, it's not for everyone - but it's a wonderful life!

Id: [0x00107911]
Compared to what I'm used to, it was a breath of fresh air.

Id: [0x00107912]
That is so good to hear.

Id: [0x00107913]
Here, for your troubles.

Id: [0x00107915]
The people may be the heart of Athens, but my play will be its voice!

Id: [0x00107935]
Greetings! Choose your Test Case.

Id: [0x00107939]
This checks if the Oasis Variable is at True or False. It should be False by Default and bring you to a sequence that sets it to True, but only the first time.

Id: [0x0010793D]
Setting the Oasis Text variable to True.

Id: [0x0010793E]
If this is successful, the dialogue will go back to the previous block and go in a different sequence than this one.

Id: [0x00107941]
The Oasis Variable setup was a success! You may Pass the Oasis Variable check in your checklist.

Id: [0x00107942]
Would you like to proceed with the Quest Resource Variable?

Id: [0x00107945]
This checks if the Quest Resource Variable is at True or False. It should be False by Default and bring you to a sequence that sets it to True, but only the first time.

Id: [0x00107947]
Setting the Quest Resource variable to True.

Id: [0x00107948]
If this is successful, the dialogue will go back to the previous block and go in a different sequence than this one.

Id: [0x0010794A]
The Quest Resource Variable setup was a success! You may Pass the Quest Resource Variable check and the Affects the Dialogue check in your checklist.

Id: [0x0010794B]
Returning to the Test Case HUB.

Id: [0x00107953]
Why is the Cult hunting our family?

Id: [0x00107954]
It is our family's destiny to control the power in this place. In our blood lies the key to unlocking the secrets of Atlantis.

Id: [0x00107955]
So they want our blood?

Id: [0x00107956]
You have a destiny, my child, to destroy the Cult and their influence on the Greek world. You threaten everything they have striven for because you have the power to oppose them.

Id: [0x00107957]
They've tried to destroy me and failed. And they'll never control me.

Id: [0x00107991]
This place is nice.

Id: [0x001079C8]
This is an important choice! You know that because it was in bold.

Id: [0x001079C9]
This one will only appear once, a different one should be available upon returning to the HUB. If this is the case, you may Pass the "Once Choice" check and the "After Choice" check in your checklist.

Id: [0x001079CA]
Both Important Choice have to be selected to progress further, this is due to a @MustSee2 directive. If you are allowed to progress right after this choice, submit an issue stating that MustSee commands does not work.

Id: [0x001079CC]
This is the second important choice!

Id: [0x001079CD]
You'll now be entering a Quest HUB with a series of choice. They each behave differently and should result in a pass of your checklist once verified working.

Id: [0x001079DD]
You should now be able to progress through the HUB. If this is the case, you may Pass the Must See check in your checklist.

Id: [0x001079E2]
This is a Regular choice. If this didn't work, we would be in a whole lot of trouble!

Id: [0x001079E3]
You may Pass the Regular Choice check from your Checklist.

Id: [0x001079EB]
The Must See condition worked amazingly, now returning to the Test Cases.

Id: [0x001079ED]
For Timed Choices, please speak to the NPC on the left.

Id: [0x001079EF]
I owe you beyond measure.

Id: [0x001079F9]
What?

Id: [0x00107A88]
Deimos. I knew you'd come.

Id: [0x00107ABA]
But we'll be sailing into war.

Id: [0x00107AC7]
Good, you're here. The people are waiting for me to speak.

Id: [0x00107AD9]
This is incredible. The knowledge stored here is overwhelming. It will take me years to decipher it all.

Id: [0x00107ADA]
What about sealing Atlantis... Have you found a way to do it?

Id: [0x00107ADB]
Oh... Yes, yes I think so.

Id: [0x00107ADD]
Well? What is it?

Id: [0x00107ADE]
The staff, the staff is the key.

Id: [0x00107ADF]
All right. It's time.

Id: [0x00107AE0]
I can't. Not yet.

Id: [0x00107AFB]
Oh, fine, fine! Now, teach those strangers what it means to be Kephallonian: draw blood, or <i>bleed.</i>

Id: [0x00107B05]
We can't stay here, we don't have the time.

Id: [0x00107B06]
There is so much to learn. With this knowledge, we can turn the tide of fate.

Id: [0x00107B07]
That is not our destiny. You said so yourself. [beat]You're losing sight of what's important.

Id: [0x00107B0B]
If the staff is the key to this place, I don't want to get locked in.

Id: [0x00107B0C]
I can't hand it over yet. There's still so much to see.

Id: [0x00107B0D]
That wasn't the plan.

Id: [0x00107B11]
Listen to yourself - you've gone mad. You need to accept some knowledge was not meant to be had.

Id: [0x00107B12]
Knowledge is power - the only power worth having.

Id: [0x00107B13]
At what cost?

Id: [0x00107B15]
I will not be ordered around or lectured by you.

Id: [0x00107B16]
It was your plan to seal this place, and I agreed to help.

Id: [0x00107B17]
That was before I realized what we would uncover about the First Civilization - the creation of humankind.

Id: [0x00107B18]
We are sealing this place to keep the Cult from using it to enslave humanity. That is bigger than your quest for knowledge.

Id: [0x00107B19]
The Cult will be nothing but an insect to swat once the power is ours.

Id: [0x00107B21]
It's too dangerous to leave this place open, and you know it.

Id: [0x00107B22]
You wouldn't understand.

Id: [0x00107B23]
Your pride will cost us all in the end.

Id: [0x00107B24]
It's not about pride.

Id: [0x00107B25]
What good is knowledge if you curse all of humanity in the process? It's what you wanted to avoid in the first place. Sometimes it's better if we find our own path. [beat]We are not ready for the power this place offers.

Id: [0x00107B26]
You're right. [beat]I cannot save humanity directly, but I can save it from itself.

Id: [0x00107B28]
Give me the staff. You have to - for the sake of everyone.

Id: [0x00107B2B]
The knowledge contained in here could fix everything for generations to come. I can't just walk away from that.

Id: [0x00107B2C]
What good is knowledge if there's no one around to use it?

Id: [0x00107B2D]
Leave if you must, but I will not.

Id: [0x00107B2E]
I'm not going without the staff.

Id: [0x00107B2F]
I may be old, but I'm not as weak as I appear.

Id: [0x00107B34]
Layla to Altair II. I'm in. Do you have visuals?

Id: [0x00107B37]
How are you feeling? Any nausea from the pressure change?

Id: [0x00107B38]
No, I'm fine. These rooms are... amazing.

Id: [0x00107B3F]
This shovel looks recently used.

Id: [0x00107B42]
Muddy tracks. Probably came from someone in the garden.

Id: [0x00107B45]
Looks like someone dug here.

Id: [0x00107B48]
So to get the key, I need to find the commander, Phaelos.

Id: [0x00107B4B]
Yes! By the gods, Layla, it's Atlantis!

Id: [0x00107B61]
That was a great display of rhetoric. The people will be unable to deny what they heard.

Id: [0x00107B69]
All we did was talk.

Id: [0x00107B6A]
What we did was far more. We used proof and a clear argument to bring forth an outcome that will not just hurt Kleon, but hopefully save countless lives.

Id: [0x00107B6C]
I guess I learned something. It must be from all the time I've spent around you.

Id: [0x00107B6D]
Debate may not always be as quick as a blade, but it can have just as big an effect.

Id: [0x00107C66]
But was it enough?

Id: [0x00107C67]
I believe word of Kleon's misdeeds will be shared throughout Athens. Its citizens love the city and what it stands for. Nobody wishes for it to fall.

Id: [0x00107C7D]
Ah, good work. Was it hard to obtain the artifact?

Id: [0x00107C7F]
Its owner had many questions for me. You should have come along.

Id: [0x00107C85]
Beautiful. Was it difficult to find this artifact?

Id: [0x00107C8B]
I just had to keep my eye on it.

Id: [0x00107C91]
Well done. This artifact will bring us closer to sealing the temple.

Id: [0x00107C95]
It nearly brought me closer to my tombstone.

Id: [0x00107C9D]
Hurry. That artifact will help us close off the temple.

Id: [0x00107CA1]
You're nearly as stubborn as its former owner.

Id: [0x00107CAD]
So, what's next?

Id: [0x00107CAE]
The play was a great success, as I knew it would be. With that and the proof you presented at the Pnyx, Kleon has lost much of his popularity.

Id: [0x00107CB0]
Kassandra! Brasidas sent me to find you. He's alive and well.

Id: [0x00107CB3]
Where is he now?

Id: [0x00107CB4]
Amphipolis. They're preparing for battle.

Id: [0x00107CB5]
If you reach him before I do, tell him I'm on the way.

Id: [0x00107CBC]
Silence is preferable to empty words.

Id: [0x00107CBE]
This place holds the answers to humankind's salvation, I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x00107CC0]
Fear not. Above the cloud with its shadow, is the star with its light.

Id: [0x00107D58]
Think, Layla, think... there must be a way. Something has to power up this place.

Id: [0x00107D59]
I'm re-entering the Animus. I need Kassandra to show me how she got farther inside.

Id: [0x00107D61]
There! That must be the way in.

Id: [0x00107D68]
Oh my, a <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00107D69]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x00107D6A]
My name is Gorgias, and I have spent my life researching the past of Boeotia and the Peloponnese.

Id: [0x00107D8B]
I'm looking for the other half of this amulet.

Id: [0x00107D8C]
Ah yes, I know of items like this. I was seeking a piece similar in size.

Id: [0x00107D8D]
Where is it?

Id: [0x00107D8E]
Unfortunately my apprentice was the one tracking down its final location in Lokris. He went to retrieve it, but never returned.

Id: [0x00107DBB]
I'll find your apprentice and recover the amulet piece without any trouble at all.

Id: [0x00107DBC]
Thank you. The gods have truly blessed me by sending you to help find Pibos.

Id: [0x00107DBE]
I will do everything I can to find your missing apprentice.

Id: [0x00107DBF]
I appreciate the help, <i>misthios</i>. I'm very worried about my Pibos.

Id: [0x00107DCE]
Don't worry, I'll find out what happened to Pibos.

Id: [0x00107DD1]
Where was your apprentice heading?

Id: [0x00107DD2]
We heard rumors of a sighting near the Tomb of Menoikeus[2347486], in Boeotia.

Id: [0x00107DD3]
What was Pibos looking for?

Id: [0x00107DD4]
There was a cave discovered that might contain items of great significance. I sent him to validate the claims before I made the journey myself.

Id: [0x00107E02]
And you need some heads to roll to get things started?

Id: [0x00107E03]
You'll be paid very handsomely for your efforts.

Id: [0x00107F3D]
My services are expensive.

Id: [0x00107F3E]
I - of course. You're worth every drachma. There would be more, but Swordfish already took his cut.

Id: [0x00107F41]
There's enough widows in this world - we didn't need another. I was happy to help.

Id: [0x00108124]
Brasidas needs my help. I plan on giving it to him. [beat]Though should our paths cross, I won't hesitate to kill Kleon.

Id: [0x00108125]
Whatever you decide, remember he is only a man.

Id: [0x00108126]
Kleon dies now. This is our chance.

Id: [0x00108127]
The plan is already working. Death shouldn't be brought early, even to someone like Kleon.

Id: [0x00108128]
He's <i>exactly</i> the type death should come early to. Not all who live deserve to grow old, Sokrates.

Id: [0x00108129]
And you decide who deserves it?

Id: [0x0010812A]
This time I do.

Id: [0x0010812B]
Then safe travels.

Id: [0x00108132]
You're coming, are you?

Id: [0x00108133]
If you're going, I'm going.

Id: [0x00108137]
- brother.

Id: [0x0010813C]
Choose wisely!

Id: [0x0010813F]
Phoibe, you're not old enough. I can't look after you all the time.

Id: [0x00108140]
I can look after myself. I don't need anyone to help me!

Id: [0x00108141]
Even if that were true, it's not your time.

Id: [0x00108142]
But I wouldn't be any trouble. Promise!

Id: [0x00108152]
I would if it meant staying with you.

Id: [0x00108159]
Thanks, Phoibe.

Id: [0x0010815A]
But you have to <i>promise</i> we'll see each other again.

Id: [0x00108160]
Where do you come from?

Id: [0x00108161]
Everywhere, nowhere. The Adrestia is my home, but I was born in an olive grove in Mykonos. I haven't stepped foot there since I left for the military.

Id: [0x00108162]
So you're a soldier?

Id: [0x00108163]
I was. My brothers and I were captains in the Athenian fleet... until one night during a siege, Poseidon's fury destroyed our ships. That was the night I saw it.

Id: [0x00108174]
It? What did you see?

Id: [0x00108177]
The sea god commands more than just the winds and the waves when he truly unleashes his temper.

Id: [0x00108179]
I saw his beast, his murderous pet. Few believe me, but this dead eye is a permanent reminder. Punishment for looking on Poseidon's forbidden creature and living to tell the tale.

Id: [0x0010817C]
Hello again, <i>misthios</i>. What can I do for you?

Id: [0x0010817F]
Yes, the Cyclops tends to take that personally.

Id: [0x0010818C]
Seeing as I saved your ship and your life, I'd say you owe me.

Id: [0x00108192]
Sokrates was right. This is exactly what we needed.

Id: [0x001081AF]
The more people who experience my blistering indictment of Kleon, the better.

Id: [0x001081B7]
I promise. You haven't seen the last of me. Just stay out of trouble until then.

Id: [0x001081BA]
I will, don't worry! [beat]OK, you can leave now!

Id: [0x001081BC]
Phoibe, I'm never coming back.

Id: [0x001081BE]
Someone's counting on me. To do something very dangerous. And there's a new future in it for me if I succeed.

Id: [0x001081C0]
I won't see you ever again?

Id: [0x001081C1]
I don't know. Until we do, you just have to keep yourself safe.

Id: [0x001081CD]
It's up to the Fates, but I'd like to.

Id: [0x001081CE]
The Fates know we're best friends, Kassandra. They'll make <i>sure </i>we meet again.

Id: [0x001081CF]
If you say so.

Id: [0x001081D2]
I say so!

Id: [0x001081D6]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00108216]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]I'll be back soon.

Id: [0x00108218]
I will.

Id: [0x00108222]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x00108224]
Leaving Kephallonia without saying goodbye to your dear Markos? Tell me it isn't true!

Id: [0x00108225]
Well, you're here now, so it won't be true. Goodbye, Markos.

Id: [0x00108226]
All these years as a dynamic duo. I'll never replace you! [beat]Well, I may need another assistant someday. But it won't be easy!

Id: [0x00108228]
Come now, give me a hug!

Id: [0x00108231]
You are too tense. Come here and lie a while. We've time to have a little fun... Or is it always business with you?

Id: [0x00108232]
Is it with you?

Id: [0x00108234]
So blood does pulse in those veins...

Id: [0x00108236]
Is this proof enough of his death?

Id: [0x00108237]
Not quite the sword I meant... But, as long as he's dead.

Id: [0x00108238]
My part is done. Go make sure Thespis is at the theater in time for his performance.

Id: [0x0010825F]
[&phew]All right, come here.

Id: [0x00108261]
Yes, bring it in! Oh, will I ever miss you, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00108262]
Partners shake hands.

Id: [0x00108264]
The true sign of a woman in business!

Id: [0x0010826E]
And what does the future hold for you?

Id: [0x0010826F]
Wine, of course! Though, you never know when the vines will wither. I'm always ready for another adventure!

Id: [0x00108271]
Ready to set sail?

Id: [0x00108273]
Play?

Id: [0x00108274]
I just do what I'm told, and they told me to destroy the manuscript.

Id: [0x00108276]
Thank you, thank you...

Id: [0x001082A3]
Don't forget, we're a team. We'll back you up until you're finished your investigation.

Id: [0x001082A4]
I know. Kiyoshi secured the loft yesterday and he's keeping an eye out. Alannah's on call doing historical research.

Id: [0x001082B4]
Eager to re-enter I see.

Id: [0x001082C5]
No, I should look around some more before I go back to Greece.

Id: [0x001082CA]
Yes, I'm ready to go back to Kassandra.

Id: [0x001082D3]
Are you sure you want to go back into the Animus right now? I get the impression you'll be there a long time.

Id: [0x00108440]
Weaklings! You cannot stop us!

Id: [0x00108443]
You're a gift from the goddess herself!

Id: [0x00108444]
And by the Fates -

Id: [0x0010844A]
Yes, your goddess has blessed you. I am a fine specimen.

Id: [0x0010844B]
But, so are you.

Id: [0x0010844C]
I've always liked the charmers.

Id: [0x0010844E]
I guess you didn't like these guys.

Id: [0x0010844F]
You can fight, I'm impressed.

Id: [0x00108452]
You're making me blush, stranger.

Id: [0x00108453]
And I could do so much more.

Id: [0x00108456]
I'm not sure about all of that, but you can definitely fight.

Id: [0x00108458]
I may be a priestess of love, but I also bite. I always [beat]bite.

Id: [0x00108459]
One has to be bold to attack a priestess. You must be important.

Id: [0x0010845A]
I am Diona, a simple acolyte born to serve Aphrodite. These thugs are dogs of the Cult of Kosmos, and this has not been the first attempt on my life.

Id: [0x0010845B]
Not here. We'll be safer in the city. Escort me?

Id: [0x00108461]
Let's go. You can tell me everything you know about the Cult when we arrive.

Id: [0x00108465]
You'll be fine on your own.

Id: [0x00108466]
Well, when you can be bothered, I'll be in the city. You might find what I have to say interesting.

Id: [0x0010846D]
I'm safe here. The Cult of Kosmos would never strike inside the city.

Id: [0x0010846E]
Good. Tell me more about them.

Id: [0x0010846F]
Right now? At least let me catch my breath.

Id: [0x00108474]
Missed me?

Id: [0x00108475]
You clearly didn't need an escort.

Id: [0x00108476]
But who doesn't want some company?

Id: [0x00108477]
Some of us enjoy solitude.

Id: [0x00108478]
You're just here for the Cult of Kosmos, aren't you? You break my heart.

Id: [0x0010847A]
We've always kept tabs on the Cult, and lately they've gotten bolder.

Id: [0x0010847B]
By the Fates! They've driven my sister, the High Priestess, to lock herself in her chambers!

Id: [0x0010847E]
A Cult leader must be involved if they are trying to kill such a public figure.

Id: [0x0010847F]
We're not dealing with the usual rats.

Id: [0x00108495]
First, my associate by the harbor needs help. Pay him a visit.

Id: [0x001084DF]
Diona! Where is she?

Id: [0x001084F1]
You're <i>identical twins?! </i>Don't move or I'll cut you <i>both</i> down!

Id: [0x001084F2]
Thank the Fates! They were going to kill me and blame it on you! Strike Diona down!

Id: [0x001084F3]
<i>She's</i> Diona! Her jealousy and bitterness have driven her to work with the Cult. My own sister!

Id: [0x001084F4]
This is madness! <i>She's</i> Diona! And she's conspired with the Cult to usurp my position as High Priestess.

Id: [0x001084F5]
Don't be deceived, <i>misthios</i>! They've set this final trap to fool you!

Id: [0x001084FA]
The High Priestess is dead, mercenary. You're next.

Id: [0x001084FF]
I can't believe you're twins.

Id: [0x0010850A]
I could just kill you both. Maybe I <i>should</i>.

Id: [0x0010850B]
Kill us both?! You truly think they care which one of us lives or dies?

Id: [0x0010850C]
She speaks true! By the Fates, with both of us dead, the Cult will simply send their own High Priestess to fill the void!

Id: [0x0010850D]
You would know what the Cult would do, wouldn't you, snake?!

Id: [0x0010850E]
What if I let you settle this yourself?

Id: [0x0010850F]
Walk away and you'll have more blood on your hands! Diona will surely slay me!

Id: [0x00108510]
Snake!

Id: [0x00108511]
The High Priestess will know what was in the note from her handmaiden.

Id: [0x00108512]
Don't listen to her lies! I am the High Priestess!

Id: [0x00108514]
Both stay where you are. If you move, I'll cut you down.

Id: [0x00108519]
I see right through you, Diona. It's over.

Id: [0x0010851A]
By the Fates, I'll kill you both!

Id: [0x0010851E]
You haven't fooled me. It's over, Diona!

Id: [0x0010851F]
You idiot. Aphrodite aid me!

Id: [0x0010858B]
This associate of yours, where is he?

Id: [0x0010858C]
Ask for the harbor master at the tavern in Skandeia Harbor. He'll be the obnoxious drunk.

Id: [0x00108590]
Fishmonger, I'm looking for Swordfish.

Id: [0x00108787]
The temple. Where is it?

Id: [0x0010878A]
It's on Aphrodite's Watch, up the hill. You'll find the High Priestess there, hiding in her chambers.

Id: [0x00108796]
How will I get to these ruins?

Id: [0x00108797]
The Mycenaean Ruins are to the south of the city, north of Skandeia Bay. The poison vials should be in a bag.

Id: [0x00108799]
I'll do what I can for you and Kythera.

Id: [0x0010879A]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Perhaps... when all this is over, we could unwind together.

Id: [0x0010879B]
Priorities, Diona. I'll see you later.

Id: [0x001087DD]
Your sister sends her regards.

Id: [0x001087DF]
Here's your apothecary's bag.

Id: [0x001087E5]
I've done what you asked. What now?

Id: [0x001087E8]
I have more questions.

Id: [0x001087EA]
Sounds like you need to find that axe for Poseidon.

Id: [0x001087EB]
But the Arkalochori Axe was crafted for this very purpose!

Id: [0x001087F6]
I've freed your mercenaries and dealt with the captain as you desired.

Id: [0x001087FA]
The old man is here.

Id: [0x00108808]
I've told you everything I know!

Id: [0x0010880F]
What drove everyone out of the labyrinth? Something must have happened.

Id: [0x00108810]
I stayed outside and prayed, but I heard it - the Minotaur. Two returned, but Nikios...

Id: [0x00108825]
You're a good man. Will you be all right?

Id: [0x00108826]
Yes, I have a friend I can go to. Thank you <i>misthios</i>. I'll make offerings on your behalf.

Id: [0x00108828]
We have to get to safety!

Id: [0x0010882A]
My sister wants me to secure Kythera from the Cult and sniff out the Cultist behind her troubles.

Id: [0x00108830]
That could work. Your sister sounds smart.

Id: [0x00108831]
The plan isn't that praiseworthy. I was nearly killed!

Id: [0x00108835]
Risking your life while she hides away? Ridiculous.

Id: [0x00108836]
Sadly her life is more valuable to Kythera than my own.

Id: [0x00108837]
By the Fates, <i>misthios</i>! I can't secure Kythera by myself. You've got to help me.

Id: [0x00108838]
Unfortunate, but her plan is still good.

Id: [0x00108844]
Did you find out anything about this "<i>traitor</i>"?

Id: [0x00108848]
There seems to be a traitor in the temple, but she's unsure who. There was just a note reading "Do not trust the Fates."

Id: [0x00108849]
Interesting. It really is as my sister says, we can't trust anyone...

Id: [0x00108851]
My scouts will meet us at my villa. They'll fill us in on what they've discovered, thanks to your efforts. I have something else to attend to, but...

Id: [0x00108852]
If I get there, and we have some time on our hands, by the Fates, we'll have some fun.

Id: [0x00108858]
You'd better hurry. I'll see you at the villa.

Id: [0x0010885A]
I will.

Id: [0x0010885B]
No. The Cult is what's important right now. I'll see you at the villa.

Id: [0x0010885D]
By the Fates, you can only resist me for so long...

Id: [0x00108866]
Anything should I know about Megaris?

Id: [0x00108867]
Only that it's the most valuable land in the Greek world, from a military perspective of course. Unfortunately for Megarians, it has two very powerful neighbors who just can't seem to play nice. In the tug of war between Korinth and Athens, Megaris is the rope.

Id: [0x001088A3]
You'd best be leaving.

Id: [0x001088CA]
And it is one you can not win.[breath]

Id: [0x00108AB5]
I work better when I'm tense.

Id: [0x00108AB6]
Well, when this is all over with, perhaps you and I can find a nice, quiet place to unwind.

Id: [0x00108AB7]
We'll see.

Id: [0x00108AB9]
I could use some relaxing.

Id: [0x00108ABA]
Say no more.

Id: [0x00108ABD]
Even in times of war, a little bit of fun goes a <i>long</i> way.

Id: [0x00108AC6]
I've been looking for you. [beat]It's not a good thing.

Id: [0x00108AC7]
Seems you've overstayed your welcome. I was hired to get rid of you.

Id: [0x00108AC8]
I'm a mercenary. If I was hired to find you, you know what comes next.

Id: [0x00108AC9]
You're not very popular in these parts. You know why I'm here, don't you?

Id: [0x00108ACA]
You've made a few enemies, stranger. Including the person who hired me.

Id: [0x00108AEF]
Enough. If you're going to die, do it with dignity.

Id: [0x00108B18]
It feels different without Perikles.

Id: [0x00108B28]
So you're taking down Kleon. Tell me the plan.

Id: [0x00109010]
You came for a fight. Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x00109011]
Very well. I know when to accept my fate.

Id: [0x00109012]
Fine. Give it your best shot.

Id: [0x0010902D]
Desert my post to sail with a mercenary hired to kill me? On second thought, let's get this over with now.

Id: [0x0010902E]
You're asking me to shirk my duty to do grunt work aboard your ship? Not a chance.

Id: [0x001090DD]
A misthios! Well, aren't you a sight to my aged eyes. Young. Energetic. [beat]Perhaps I should just pay for your body instead of your help.

Id: [0x001090E6]
Watch yourself. That's not my line of work.

Id: [0x001090E7]
Forgive me. I'm amazed the gods would send me someone so well-suited to help me, but who is also so appealing to me physically.

Id: [0x001090E9]
All things get better with age, don't they? Even you.

Id: [0x001090EA]
The Oracle said that if I'm to live a long and happy life, I need to stay young... at heart. But I musn't lose focus. I need your <i>help</i> more than your magnificent body.

Id: [0x001090ED]
Koragos, my husband, is having some difficulties keeping up with my hunger for... pleasure.

Id: [0x001090FB]
All right, I'll find the ingredients... If you promise to keep your nocturnal activities to yourself.

Id: [0x001090FC]
I have some drachmae, and Koragos has more. If you can bring me some bear scrotum and a deer tongue, I can make the elixir.

Id: [0x00109100]
Your sex life. Your problem.

Id: [0x00109104]
Without the elixir, I fear I'll need to find even more lovers to feed my appetite.

Id: [0x001091AC]
Assistant? I don't think so.

Id: [0x001091AD]
I-I meant Markos's muscle! How stupid of me.

Id: [0x001091AE]
This will tide you over until the rest of the wood arrives in town.

Id: [0x001091B2]
Ah, it's Markos's assistant! Bringing me the wood I need, I hope.

Id: [0x001091B4]
Calm down. What are you talking about?

Id: [0x001091B5]
My masterpiece! It will change everything - amuse, astound, titillate, and open peoples' eyes to Kleon's machinations! But I need you.

Id: [0x0010924D]
Come on, come on. It's got to be here!

Id: [0x0010925B]
<i>Pater</i>...

Id: [0x0010925D]
Kassandra! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0010925F]
I came to kill him.

Id: [0x00109260]
He wouldn't have been a challenge for you.

Id: [0x00109261]
But I'm glad our paths have crossed again.

Id: [0x00109262]
Some of the boys are meant to keep him drunk in the tavern down the street.

Id: [0x00109278]
I'm glad to hear it.

Id: [0x001092E1]
This is your burden now. Humanity's fate will be decided by the choices you make.

Id: [0x001092E2]
I understand.

Id: [0x001092E3]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00109320]
It's over. Give me the staff.

Id: [0x00109323]
You do not deserve the infinite knowledge of our creators.

Id: [0x00109324]
That's the point. Nobody does.

Id: [0x00109325]
[grunt then gasp]No![death grunts as he loses strength]

Id: [0x00109333]
Ha! Funnily enough, that was the inspiration.

Id: [0x00109343]
I imagine any man would.

Id: [0x00109344]
Oh, I have many lovers, but he's my soulmate. When we're together, it's indescribable.

Id: [0x00109345]
Then don't describe it.

Id: [0x00109346]
When we were younger, we would run into the moonlit forest, shed our clothes, and pleasure each other until sunrise. Our howls of ecstasy would echo throughout the valleys.

Id: [0x0010935A]
From the Cyclops? That's how he bought his vineyard?

Id: [0x0010935B]
Look, I know you'd be dead without Markos - what with him taking you off the street as a kid. But you know what he's doing is crazy!

Id: [0x0010935C]
<i>Maláka</i>! [beat]Still, that doesn't change the drachmae you owe.

Id: [0x0010935D]
Face it - once the Cyclops gets hold of you, you'll both be dead!

Id: [0x0010935E]
Pleasure doing business with you, Duris.

Id: [0x0010935F]
Keep my name off your lips! I don't want the Cyclops coming after me for the debt you can't pay.

Id: [0x00109383]
What is it with you? There is more at stake here than a few moments of pleasure.

Id: [0x00109385]
Do not worry. I will see you at the play, with Thespis.

Id: [0x0010938F]
Yaaaarh!

Id: [0x00109394]
You're running out of time until the Cyclops comes for you, <i>maláka</i>. He wants his<i> money</i>!

Id: [0x00109395]
Could I have an extension?

Id: [0x00109396]
When he sails back to Kephallonia, he'll come and <i>break</i> you as soon as he docks. <i>If </i>you don't get it.

Id: [0x00109397]
Now, let's be civil -

Id: [0x00109398]
Good. Or I'll come and watch the Cyclops feed you to his goats.

Id: [0x0010939A]
Oh, don't be scared of him! Look at you!

Id: [0x0010939B]
How could I go up against him? With what weapons? A rusty spear? A broken bow?

Id: [0x001093AC]
You're right about that. [beat]Forget the drachmae. Markos and I need to have a talk.

Id: [0x001093AD]
You better set Markos straight. Or you're both dead!

Id: [0x001093BD]
You can't hide behind your glorious<i> misthios </i>forever, Markos. He'll kill <i>you</i>, the mercenary, <i>and</i> that little runt girl that hangs around.

Id: [0x001093BE]
Of course! Not a problem! I-I'll get the drachmae!

Id: [0x001093C7]
We can get the money back! C-Can't we? I'm sure it's possible!

Id: [0x001093CC]
It roars, but what of Thespis?

Id: [0x001093CE]
Thespis is an actor, half the girls here have been his muse at one time or another...

Id: [0x001093D1]
Now... [&breath]we need to worry about Thespis and Aristophanes's play.

Id: [0x001093D2]
This play is important to you.

Id: [0x001093D3]
With it, we hope to make change... for the better.

Id: [0x001093D5]
It's enough for you to know that I plan to stop men like Commander Rhexenor and Kleon.

Id: [0x001093D9]
This play could help decide the fate of Athens. I need you to keep your word and go to Thespis.

Id: [0x001093E2]
You've made an idiotic promise, Markos. One we can't keep.

Id: [0x001093E4]
I thought you were invincible.

Id: [0x001093E5]
Maybe I am. But you're not.

Id: [0x001093E6]
It will take a<i> lot </i>of work. And even then I'm not sure.

Id: [0x001093E7]
We have no option but to try!

Id: [0x001093E8]
Then <i>you'd </i>better be willing to help. I won't do all the dirty work.

Id: [0x001093F1]
[&ah]I long for the old days! Remember them? They were simple! You had nothing - young and alone - and I had everything. And I gave you the world! Kephallonia - in the palm of your hand!

Id: [0x001093F2]
And now the Cyclops will take everything away. I can't protect you from him forever. He'll kill me too.

Id: [0x001093FC]
[&snort]Kephallonia. [&hmm]Some gift.

Id: [0x001093FD]
You were nothing without Markos, and look how far we've come! From an orphan on the streets to a <i>misthios</i> with a hovel.

Id: [0x00109404]
Athenians are the best sailors in the world. We live for it. [beat]Point me to the ship.

Id: [0x00109406]
I want to go home one day. Set my eyes on Athens and the Parthenon, drink good wine, have good laughs. But today is not that day. Let's set sail, Captain.

Id: [0x00109408]
And leave this behind? The rotten food. The mud. The broken bones. The pain. The exhaustion... Sure. I'll join you.

Id: [0x0010940E]
That's a kind offer, <i>misthios</i>, but when I go home to Athens, I will go home a hero. That's the life I want.

Id: [0x00109415]
Ha! I'm flattered, <i>misthios. </i>But my sword is pledged to Athens, and they don't take kindly to deserters.

Id: [0x00109417]
The open sea is tempting, but I can't leave my family, <i>misthios</i>. I've got roots here. You'll understand someday.

Id: [0x00109724]
High Priestess. Open up.

Id: [0x00109725]
So you can kill me? Who sent you!

Id: [0x0010973E]
She was murdered. It might have something to do with this note... it says "Don't trust the Fates."

Id: [0x00109742]
I last sent her to the outskirts of the city east of Pilgrim Hill.

Id: [0x0010974C]
Diona sent me. I'm a friend.

Id: [0x0010974D]
If I wanted you dead, I wouldn't have knocked. Diona sent me.

Id: [0x0010975E]
The Cult? Tell me all that you know. Now.

Id: [0x00109762]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. I'll watch my back. Is there something else?

Id: [0x00109768]
Thespis said I'd find you here.

Id: [0x00109769]
Ah, my darling Thespis, an artist in so many ways... But let's talk about us.

Id: [0x0010976A]
You don't understand, I need your help.

Id: [0x0010976B]
So many do. These hands have helped more people than Hippokrates.

Id: [0x0010976C]
Elpenor, you coward!

Id: [0x00109773]
Only a few? You don't rate yourself highly in love, then.

Id: [0x001097A1]
[&cough]Killing me is a mistake.

Id: [0x001097A2]
Trusting you on Kephallonia was a mistake.

Id: [0x001097A3]
I'm the reason you left that island alive. The Cult wanted you dead.

Id: [0x001097A5]
What cult? Where are they?

Id: [0x001097BD]
We have no other choice now. We need a plan.

Id: [0x001097BE]
That's what I do best!

Id: [0x001097C0]
This'll take more than the usual tricks up your sleeve.

Id: [0x001097DD]
I can see where this is going, Sokrates, and we don't have time for it right now.

Id: [0x001097DE]
Aristophanes gave the same excuse... But yes, you're right.

Id: [0x001097E0]
Sokrates. Kleon deserves to die.

Id: [0x001097E3]
I should read this note.

Id: [0x001097E6]
Eagles are fine and all, but a pet monkey would be even cooler.

Id: [0x001097E8]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x00109800]
What if I told you I had obsidian to trade?

Id: [0x00109801]
I'd tell you I still need 100,000 drachmae! Besides, even if I took your obsidian, a ship this size needs an army to sail it.

Id: [0x00109802]
As do we all, eventually. But only the gods decide when.

Id: [0x00109803]
<i>He</i> decided when he sent that fleet to bring death to an entire island.

Id: [0x00109804]
So you believe it is good to kill one man to save one thousand?

Id: [0x0010980E]
What do you say?

Id: [0x0010980F]
To get away from Athens... Thank you, thank you.

Id: [0x00109812]
You'd take me?

Id: [0x00109813]
For your troubles, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00109816]
The fact that it's true makes it true. You can't place Kleon and me side by side and say we're the same.

Id: [0x0010981B]
I may not, but others would. And is it not those people we must convince? Kleon is not the man they think he is.

Id: [0x0010981D]
I define myself. And I'm not Kleon.

Id: [0x00109841]
Nor is any Athenian I've ever known. But to convince them of that we need proof.

Id: [0x0010984B]
Please bring back the ingredients quickly. I miss the touch of my Koragos's fingers upon my skin.

Id: [0x001098A9]
This is the easy part.

Id: [0x001098E5]
I need more information to find Kleon.

Id: [0x001098E6]
I'll try to help.

Id: [0x001098EC]
Where's the best place to look?

Id: [0x001098ED]
I've been told Kleon frequents the western side of the akropolis.

Id: [0x00109943]
Mind of a misthios! You know who you remind me of? Me. [&laughs]A much younger me of course, before I found my true purpose... and lost my eye.

Id: [0x00109945]
You're changing the subject.

Id: [0x00109946]
Ah yes, my apologies. You're right, I owe you my life. What could humble Barnabas do for the mighty Kassandra?

Id: [0x00109947]
I need a ship, and a crew.

Id: [0x00109948]
[&laughs]Of course you do!

Id: [0x00109949]
So, that's a yes?

Id: [0x0010994A]
My ship, my crew, and my services are yours!

Id: [0x00109950]
An interesting choice.

Id: [0x00109951]
How fascinating you are.

Id: [0x00109952]
That is a bold choice.

Id: [0x00109955]
You do amuse me.

Id: [0x00109956]
Your perception is admirable.

Id: [0x00109957]
I wonder why you chose that.

Id: [0x0010995A]
I expected no less.

Id: [0x0010995B]
I can see the wisdom in that answer.

Id: [0x0010995C]
You're a wise one.

Id: [0x0010997C]
That's one way to look at it.

Id: [0x0010997D]
Only time will tell.

Id: [0x00109980]
You're sharp, for a human.

Id: [0x00109981]
How fascinating.

Id: [0x00109982]
This is most entertaining.

Id: [0x00109983]
Impressive, little one. Most impressive.

Id: [0x001099A2]
An interesting choice.

Id: [0x001099A3]
That could be.

Id: [0x001099A6]
You're full of surprises.

Id: [0x001099A7]
I can see your reasoning.

Id: [0x001099A8]
That is a bold choice.

Id: [0x001099AB]
This is most entertaining.

Id: [0x001099AC]
I'm impressed.

Id: [0x001099AD]
How fascinating.

Id: [0x001099B0]
You do amuse me.

Id: [0x001099B1]
A keen mind.

Id: [0x001099B2]
Well done, mortal.

Id: [0x001099B3]
I wonder why you chose that?

Id: [0x001099B4]
Even if you had a boat, who's going to row it? You? [&laughs]I'd give my left grape to see that!

Id: [0x001099B5]
This is Kephallonia. I could always find someone down on their luck and willing to work for next to nothing to get off this island.

Id: [0x001099B6]
You're not being very helpful, Telemenes.

Id: [0x001099BD]
A likely answer.

Id: [0x001099BE]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x001099BF]
How clever you are.

Id: [0x001099C7]
Rumors mean nothing. Don't believe everything you hear.

Id: [0x001099C8]
Rumor also has it his ship has docked in Kleptous Bay.

Id: [0x001099CB]
His ship you say? I'll have to pay Kleptous Bay a visit.

Id: [0x001099CF]
You're highly perceptive.

Id: [0x001099D0]
Such imagination.

Id: [0x001099D3]
I wonder what led you to choose that?

Id: [0x001099D4]
You do amuse me.

Id: [0x001099D5]
Good thinking, little one.

Id: [0x001099D6]
I see your logic.

Id: [0x001099D8]
<i>Maláka</i>! How is that helpful?

Id: [0x001099D9]
That monster's held Kephallonia captive for too long. I figured if anyone could finally rid us of his stench, it would be you.

Id: [0x001099DA]
Telemenes, what does this have to do with my need for a boat?

Id: [0x001099DB]
Rumor also has it the Cyclops has docked his ship in Kleptous Bay.

Id: [0x001099E4]
I've come to end you and take your power.

Id: [0x001099E5]
Many before you have tried. All have failed.

Id: [0x001099E6]
I won't.

Id: [0x001099E7]
While it would amuse me to see you try, harming me will not give you what you seek. The only way to acquire the power I possess is to impress me with your mind.

Id: [0x001099EB]
You protect an object of great power. I have been asked to return it to where it belongs.

Id: [0x001099EC]
A most noble of causes. Sadly I cannot grant your request.

Id: [0x001099ED]
There's too much at stake. I won't leave without it.

Id: [0x001099EE]
The power I guard is not for the weak-willed.

Id: [0x001099EF]
I can resist.

Id: [0x001099F0]
One must risk everything in the pursuit of knowledge. If you can answer my questions wisely, you will have proven yourself worthy.

Id: [0x00109A1F]
What did that idiot girl send a <i>misthios </i>for? I gave her orders to follow, not to delegate.

Id: [0x00109A20]
To run her errands? You must be another one of her idiotic suitors.

Id: [0x00109A23]
She says you think there's a traitor in your midst.

Id: [0x00109A25]
Excellent. Anger is a wonderful motivator.

Id: [0x00109A6D]
You can't trust anyone these days.

Id: [0x00109A86]
What do you want with the Cult?

Id: [0x00109A87]
They ripped my family apart! I'll have vengeance.

Id: [0x00109A97]
They have wronged my family and it's only right they pay for it. I'll have justice.

Id: [0x00109A98]
Family is indeed a powerful motivator.

Id: [0x00109CF3]
I'll get you the information your handmaiden found.

Id: [0x00109DC0]
I'll be back.

Id: [0x00109DFA]
That makes no sense.

Id: [0x00109DFB]
She protected it with her life. It wasn't for nothing.

Id: [0x00109DFD]
Our situation is dire. Work with Diona. Secure Kythera for us, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00109E04]
Slay Diona where she stands!

Id: [0x00109E05]
She's always been jealous of my success, mercenary. Living in my shadow has finally broken her. Kill her, now!

Id: [0x00109E06]
Lived in my shadow?! I loved you, Diona. I never wanted to be your superior.

Id: [0x00109E08]
Do the right thing, <i>misthios</i>! Slay Diona!

Id: [0x00109E09]
Shut up!

Id: [0x00109E0A]
She knows I am the one who will perish. If you do nothing, the fall of Kythera will be all your fault.

Id: [0x00109E10]
Why are you hesitating? The answer is clear!

Id: [0x00109E11]
You're both out to get me, aren't you?

Id: [0x00109E12]
Don't be stupid. I'm only after the Cult!

Id: [0x00109E13]
Deceiver! I'll kill you first, then deal with this snake.

Id: [0x00109E1C]
Ahh, come here, gives us a hug.

Id: [0x00109E27]
Why do people keep telling me that?

Id: [0x00109E3F]
You can't protect anyone, can you?

Id: [0x00109E41]
This smells awful. Who would drink an elixir made from this?

Id: [0x00109E44]
There's a bear. There's my scrotum.

Id: [0x00109E48]
Pull yourself together, <i>maláka</i>! You're a fucking pig before slaughter!

Id: [0x00109E49]
I'll do it, I swear! I'll kill him! Let me <i>go!</i>

Id: [0x00109E4A]
Show him what happens to cowards! They get fuckin' burned!

Id: [0x00109E53]
No. He's yours.

Id: [0x00109E54]
[&groan]You don't know what the fuck fun is. More for me.

Id: [0x001E848C]
Oh happy day for us and for our children if Kleon should perish.

Id: [0x001E848E]
Such insults! And to think I was going to propose a statue to be erected in the city to each of you for your bravery!

Id: [0x001E848F]
See! He treats us like old dotards and crawls at our feet to deceive us; but the cunning wherein his power lies shall this time recoil on himself!

Id: [0x001E8492]
[gah]Alas! The conspirators are murdering me![theatrical pains]

Id: [0x001E84A7]
Hand it to me.

Id: [0x001E84AB]
No! No!

Id: [0x001E84B2]
Fuck with me, and there's plenty more where that came from!

Id: [0x001E84B5]
...Does he deserve it?

Id: [0x001E84B6]
Doesn't fucking matter, does it? What I say goes! No questions asked!

Id: [0x001E84B7]
I will, I will! I'll kill Phidias!

Id: [0x001E84B8]
If you can't kill a fucking artist, what are you gonna do when I tell you to kill a fucking <i>archon</i>?

Id: [0x001E84C3]
By Hades, where'd that drunk put the manuscript?

Id: [0x001E84C4]
The Commander will be furious if I don't find it.

Id: [0x001E84C8]
Now he heads to Amphipolis in an effort to redeem himself.

Id: [0x001E84C9]
So what are you going to do?

Id: [0x001E84CE]
He said you're behind a mask - you'll be perfectly safe, he saids...

Id: [0x001E84D9]
I can't promise anything.

Id: [0x001E84DD]
Be safe.

Id: [0x001E84E2]
You need to sober up. This play's important.

Id: [0x001E84E3]
So's Aikaterine! I need my muse.

Id: [0x001E84E4]
Please? She's just west of here at the House of Aphrodite.

Id: [0x001E8611]
I've been hearing about this Commander Rhexenor a lot recently.

Id: [0x001E8613]
He's one of Kleon's favorite dogs. I've heard stories from some of the girls. Likes to play dress up. Got a fancy robe and mask - likes to hurt people too.

Id: [0x001E8614]
Don't worry, I'll deal with Commander Rhexenor.

Id: [0x001E8615]
You don't understand what a bastard he is. He's more than just some Athenian soldier.

Id: [0x001E8616]
If I do this, will you go to Thespis?

Id: [0x001E8617]
It'd be my pleasure.

Id: [0x001E861A]
Still, to threaten you?

Id: [0x001E861B]
Actors are a superstitious bunch. Commander Rhexenor knows Thespis won't perform without his muse waiting in the wings.

Id: [0x001E861C]
Why would this Commander threaten you?

Id: [0x001E861E]
It's all to do with this stupid play. They're doing everything they can to protect Kleon's image.

Id: [0x001E861F]
I can see there is more in your eyes, but we are all entitled to our secrets.

Id: [0x001E8622]
They? What blood?

Id: [0x001E8623]
You really are more brawn than brains, aren't you? A shame, I could have used you for more of my... errands.

Id: [0x001E862A]
<i>Maláka</i>! You think you can play with me? I'll cut out your tongue!

Id: [0x001E862B]
So disappointing.

Id: [0x001E862D]
You like to watch, you sick fuck? You're not just going to watch. You're going to teach this little insolent shit a lesson.

Id: [0x001E862F]
I-I couldn't do it! But I'm not scared! Not anymore!

Id: [0x001E8632]
[&gasp]Why the face? So sad… Like the tragic mask of Melpomene. Your family is safe. For now.

Id: [0x001E8636]
I'm here. What else do you want from me?

Id: [0x001E8637]
That is up to you. But I know you'll behave. Because you know their fates if you don't.

Id: [0x001E8638]
Please. Don't.

Id: [0x001E8639]
We will kill them. Your wife. Your child. And then what would you have to live for?

Id: [0x001E863A]
Nothing.

Id: [0x001E863B]
Exactly.

Id: [0x001E863D]
No. I always finish what I start.

Id: [0x001E871D]
We've been planning this for a while. See me when everything is complete.

Id: [0x001E8728]
It's done. Gortyn is weak and ready for new leadership.

Id: [0x001E8750]
We're behind on our payments to Swordfish, so your kindness is appreciated. But here, take this.

Id: [0x001E8751]
We were too late. There was nothing I could do for your husband.

Id: [0x001E8752]
No! No...

Id: [0x001E8812]
This must be the axe... Doesn't look like it could cut <i>anything</i>.

Id: [0x001E8830]
Enter into the light of Apollo, the light that illuminates shadow.

Id: [0x001E8834]
I lost my mother when I was young. I have to find her. Where is she?

Id: [0x001E8837]
I'm looking for my father - my true father. Who is he?

Id: [0x001E883B]
It's you! From the visions! The child on the mountain.

Id: [0x001E883C]
How could you know that?

Id: [0x001E8858]
Help m...

Id: [0x001E885D]
You need to leave. Now.

Id: [0x001E8860]
Child of the Mountain, the Cult of Kosmos have eyes everywhere. They will kill you.

Id: [0x001E8861]
Cult of Kosmos?

Id: [0x001E8864]
You never answered my question!

Id: [0x001E8868]
The Oracle has spoken. The prophecy is yours.

Id: [0x001E8958]
Go... GO!

Id: [0x001E899F]
We were worried you wouldn't make it.

Id: [0x001E89A0]
What's all this?

Id: [0x001E8A36]
Especially with every Athenian guard looking for you.

Id: [0x001E8A4D]
Choose another path, traveler. The way ahead is not safe.

Id: [0x001E8A4E]
What's the problem?

Id: [0x001E8A4F]
A creature beyond the understanding of mortals claims these grounds. You have been warned.

Id: [0x001E8A53]
I hope you have a coin for the Ferryman.

Id: [0x001E8A63]
Although I hardly call it a plan. Lots of talking, not much... <i>action</i>.

Id: [0x001E8A65]
It won't be simple. His death would disrupt the peace and be worse for Athens.

Id: [0x001E8A66]
He's right. We must discredit him first.

Id: [0x001E8A67]
<i>Some </i>play? It is so much more than that.

Id: [0x001E8A73]
Guess his buyer didn't feel like paying for the sapphires.

Id: [0x001E8A74]
Here they are. A bit of blood on them, but the sapphires still shine.

Id: [0x001E8A78]
This must be the cave Photios mentioned. Those priests came this way.

Id: [0x001E8A7B]
No. I won't do it.

Id: [0x001E8A7D]
Tyche owes you somethin', you lucky bastard. You get to keep your skin today.

Id: [0x001E8A7F]
He w-would've killed me... He's insane... Thank you.

Id: [0x001E8A84]
"Agreement in full. Treasury sapphires to be sold at no discount. Meet at Desphina Fort for the sale." Well, I know where I'm headed next.

Id: [0x001E8A94]
Oh, don't get your tunic in a twist. I just don't see why we can't all <i>love</i> each other.

Id: [0x001E8A96]
It's so much more <i>fun</i> that way.

Id: [0x001E8AB3]
You'd be overtaken. There are mobs, and Kleon's doing nothing to calm them.

Id: [0x001E8AB4]
Thank the gods Kleon won't see me like this. [&breath]But that's all I can thank the gods for. [&breath]They've turned on me.

Id: [0x001E8AD0]
Where I <i>should </i>be is in the Parthenon, my greatest legacy to Athens. We need the gods' blessing. But Aspasia...

Id: [0x001E8ADE]
Isn't it a risk to show him in a bad light in front of his admirers?

Id: [0x001E8ADF]
I think the play will change their minds. Good art is risky, but my plan will work.

Id: [0x001E8AE4]
It's my time. [&breath]The plague chooses no favorites. [&groan]I fear I've failed Athens.[&breath] Its people.[&breath] Aspasia...

Id: [0x001E8AE5]
No, you haven't.

Id: [0x001E8AE6]
[&ah]You're kind, but I've lost. [&breath]Aspasia needs protection. As does Athens. I thought I gave enough to Athena, but it seems it isn't so.

Id: [0x001E8AE7]
She... knew who I was.

Id: [0x001E8AE8]
[&scoff]She's the Pythia, it's her business to act like she knows you.

Id: [0x001E8AE9]
That was no act. She said she had visions of me as a child on a mountain.

Id: [0x001E8AEA]
What child hasn't stood on a mountain?

Id: [0x001E8AEB]
I was thrown from that mountain. My life started and ended on that mountain. I'm telling you, she knew who I was. What I'd done. Tried to warn me...

Id: [0x001E8AEC]
Warn you? About what?

Id: [0x001E8AED]
Should I ask why they're bloody?

Id: [0x001E8AEE]
The priests couldn't cut it as thieves.

Id: [0x001E8B0A]
We should talk, you and I.

Id: [0x001E8B0D]
She mentioned the Cult of Kosmos. Does this mean anything to you?

Id: [0x001E8B0E]
I'd heard whispers. A cult, unlike any other, coming to Delphi. But I paid them no mind.

Id: [0x001E8B0F]
The Pythia seemed afraid of them. Guards took her away.

Id: [0x001E8B10]
That would require a miracle from the gods. She is always protected.

Id: [0x001E8B20]
That was most impressive.

Id: [0x001E8B22]
Never mind, it's nothing.

Id: [0x001E8B2F]
Taking down Kleon won't be easy.

Id: [0x001E8B30]
But with your help, it will be possible.

Id: [0x001E8B41]
I'm sure you'll get through it.

Id: [0x001E8B42]
Perhaps you can help take my mind off it...

Id: [0x001E8B4C]
Go, meet with Daphnae.

Id: [0x001E8B53]
The beast didn't stand a chance against me.

Id: [0x001E8B56]
There were moments when I thought it had me. It was a privilege to fight such a magnificent beast.

Id: [0x001E8B59]
I'm not here to hurt you. I just want answers.

Id: [0x001E8B5A]
The Pythia is a sacred vessel of the gods. People travel the world for my answers. But none of them would dare break into my home! Apollo's wrath will be cruel and swift.

Id: [0x001E8B60]
No! Guards!

Id: [0x001E8B66]
Just... just don't touch them. Don't hurt them.

Id: [0x001E8B68]
We want you to cooperate. We want you to obey. That's not asking for too much, is it?

Id: [0x001E8B6E]
For whatever reason, Artemis has clearly blessed you and guided your hand...

Id: [0x001E8B77]
All right then, highest bidder gets an Olympic match thrown in their favor.

Id: [0x001E8B78]
[scoffs]With what influence?

Id: [0x001E8B79]
My post gets me sway in any event. Come now, name your bet... If you aren't a coward.

Id: [0x001E8B7A]
A shipment of marble for the Athenians to take the discus event.

Id: [0x001E8B7B]
Ha! If it'll be that easy, then 25 of my ship slaves for the Spartan side.

Id: [0x001E8B7C]
None of that! My pockets feel light.

Id: [0x001E8B7D]
Yes, yes, how could I forget. The Olympics bring a truce of war, but never a truce in the exchange of drachmae.

Id: [0x001E8B82]
All right, I'll see Daphnae.

Id: [0x001E8B83]
You can find her at the Temple of Artemis in Phokis.

Id: [0x001E8B8C]
If she wants me, she can come and get me.

Id: [0x001E8BB4]
More?

Id: [0x001E8BB5]
No! I'll go to Athens! I'll stake out the temple! I'll kill him!

Id: [0x001E8BB6]
Good! And don't waste my fucking time again!

Id: [0x001E8BC0]
...Give the coward another chance.

Id: [0x001E8BC2]
Stay off his bad side.

Id: [0x001E8BC3]
I will! But he's right. I'll go straight to Athens. I won't fail - ever again. I'm going to <i>kill </i>Phidias.

Id: [0x001EBECB]
Enough with your lies! Tell me what I want to know!

Id: [0x001EBECC]
I can't... breathe...

Id: [0x001EBECE]
If you raise your voice... If you tell a lie... I will cut your throat.

Id: [0x001EBED1]
I'm dead already. They'll find out you were here. And they'll kill me for it.

Id: [0x001EBED2]
Who? This Cult of Kosmos?

Id: [0x001EBED5]
<i>Speak</i>!

Id: [0x001EBED7]
Yes, the Cult wants you dead. They know you're here.

Id: [0x001EBEE6]
You don't deserve a quick death. But you'll earn what you meet at the gates of Hades.

Id: [0x001EBEE9]
You don't understand. No one will forget me, Kleon of Athens. I will be remembered u -[neck crack sputter]

Id: [0x001EBEF1]
You will die just as you lived.

Id: [0x001EBEF9]
What is this Cult of Kosmos?

Id: [0x001EBEFA]
They are the eyes that see, but go unseen.

Id: [0x001EBEFB]
Enough with the riddles. I want names!

Id: [0x001EBEFC]
I don't know! I swear. They hide behind masks and shrouds.

Id: [0x001EBEFD]
Why would you work for the Cult?

Id: [0x001EBEFE]
I have no choice.

Id: [0x001EBEFF]
So all those prophecies from the gods, all those people, you're paid to deceive them all?

Id: [0x001EBF00]
Most want to know about love or death. I tell them what they want to hear. But when people want to know about war or politics, I'm paid very well to tell them what the <i>Cult</i> wants them to hear.

Id: [0x001EBF07]
Any idea where I can find him?

Id: [0x001EBF08]
There is a fort[2433087] just south of the Valley of the Nymph. He's been known to conduct business there.

Id: [0x001EBF09]
You've been helpful.

Id: [0x001EBF0B]
I sent Elpenor to the underworld. I knew the mask I stripped from his corpse would come in handy.

Id: [0x001EBF0F]
I sent Elpenor to Hades, but I didn't find any cloak or mask.

Id: [0x001EBF10]
Are you sure you checked his entire house?

Id: [0x001EBF11]
I'll go back, maybe I missed something.

Id: [0x001EBF1B]
You're not listening! Forget the mother - she's useless.

Id: [0x001EBF1C]
I hear you perfectly well - you're just wrong. We need to look for the father <i>now.</i>

Id: [0x001EBF26]
You said you saw me in your visions, what did you see?

Id: [0x001EBF27]
There is an artifact under the temple of Apollo. It reveals what only the gods should know.

Id: [0x001EBF28]
You called me the child on the mountain.

Id: [0x001EBF29]
The Cult hunts a Spartan child who survived a terrible fall from Mount Taygetos. The artifact revealed that child to be you.

Id: [0x001EBF2B]
You have an opportunity to do the right thing. Tell me where to find the Cult.

Id: [0x001EBF2E]
Tell me where they are, or we'll go find them together.

Id: [0x001EBF30]
Beneath the temple of Apollo there's an ancient chamber. I think they meet there. But without one of their cloaks and masks, you won't make it more than two steps inside.

Id: [0x001EBF32]
Tell me about Deimos.

Id: [0x001EBF33]
He's shown us what we need to know. He's a machine, a weapon for the Cult. Someone that unstable can't be trusted with such... personal information.

Id: [0x001EBF35]
I'm looking for my family, and everywhere I go people are either lying or trying to kill me. You're the first person who might have some answers.

Id: [0x001EBF36]
But they'll kill me if I tell you.

Id: [0x001EBF37]
Not if I get to them first. Help me and no harm will come to you, I promise.

Id: [0x001EBF38]
All right, but ask your questions quickly. The longer you're here, the more at risk we both are.

Id: [0x001EBF3E]
Now get out of my house.

Id: [0x001EBF44]
May the light of Apollo guide you to your family.

Id: [0x001EC322]
Pains me to say it, but we need your skills to make someone disappear. Won't you help Kythera?

Id: [0x001EC324]
Did you already forget where the captain was?

Id: [0x001EC331]
These don't look like Cult members. Probably just well-paid mercenaries.

Id: [0x001EC34D]
"Do not trust the Fates."

Id: [0x001EC34E]
Hm, it's addressed to the High Priestess. She needs to know about this.

Id: [0x001EC359]
Let's hear what exactly you want me to do first.

Id: [0x001EC35B]
Diona's enemies have forces on Chytra Atoll. They're going to use it as a staging area to launch attacks on Kythera.

Id: [0x001EC35C]
She needs you to take out the captain there. His men should disperse after that. But, still, leave none alive. Will you do it?

Id: [0x001EC414]
Must have been the bandits I killed earlier. That was an easy job. For once.

Id: [0x001EC418]
You want war?!

Id: [0x001EC44B]
Not much on this earth I hate more than filthy, thieving pirates. They're attacking anything that makes it halfway out of port.

Id: [0x001EC44D]
A shipment was sunk just off the coast not too long ago, but no one’s been able to reclaim the crate of goods. Sharks are fucking <i>everywhere</i>.

Id: [0x001EC473]
There's an island just off the coast. Rumor has it that thieves have been storing valuables there, ripe for plundering. Trouble is, sharks and pirates are swarming the waters.

Id: [0x001EC475]
Pirates have been sinking ships off the coast. I'd say they've probably amassed quite a lot of goods aboard their ship by now, but I'm more interested in the loot they've left on the sea floor.

Id: [0x001EC476]
Guards!

Id: [0x001EC480]
You take everything so personally!

Id: [0x001EC481]
Arrrrggghhh!

Id: [0x001EC48A]
I've already told you too much. Leave me alone before you get us both killed.

Id: [0x001EC48D]
What happened here? Hard to breathe with so much ash in the air.

Id: [0x001EC496]
Oh, she <i>did </i>bring you to me, Orneos. Let her go.

Id: [0x001EC497]
As quickly as I can.

Id: [0x001EC97F]
So we'll use the profits to pay him off?

Id: [0x001EC980]
It'll pay for the bulk of it - a vineyard's expensive, you know!

Id: [0x001EC9B0]
Then my new bow will come in handy.

Id: [0x001EC9B1]
Got it.

Id: [0x001EC9B2]
Pull this off, and our heads won't be the Cyclops's trophies when he comes back!

Id: [0x001EC9B4]
And yet it's<i> still</i> not enough to pay back the Cyclops.

Id: [0x001ECA1E]
Meet me at Apollo's temple in Delphi when you're done dealing with the snakes.

Id: [0x001ECB37]
He mentioned my birth father, he might still be alive.

Id: [0x001ECB38]
Not for long, if all goes according to plan.

Id: [0x001ECB39]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001ECB3A]
You're going to bring me his head, of course.

Id: [0x001ECB3B]
Have you lost your mind?

Id: [0x001ECB3C]
You killed the man who raised you for drachmae. I merely assumed you wanted your family dead as much as I do.

Id: [0x001ECB40]
He mentioned my mother - she still lives.

Id: [0x001ECB41]
Not for long, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x001ECB42]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x001ECB43]
You're going to bring me her head, of course.

Id: [0x001ECB44]
Are you out of your mind?

Id: [0x001ECB45]
You killed the man who raised you for a sack of coins. I only assumed you wanted your family dead as much as I do.

Id: [0x001ECB47]
I'm done talking. I should kill you where you stand.

Id: [0x001ECB48]
Temper, temper. [&ah]And they said you'd be different. But blood is blood, I suppose.

Id: [0x001ECB56]
Don't make me answer that.

Id: [0x001ECB58]
Take the eye - but don't sell it yet!<i> No</i> vendor would believe we came by it lawfully. They know <i>exactly </i>who it belongs to!

Id: [0x001ECB5B]
Take them out, and that's one less thing to deal with! Besides - these strangers look rich as Kroisos <i>-</i> the Cyclops pays them well!

Id: [0x001ECBAE]
I need to get back into the city. It should be safe there.

Id: [0x001ECBCD]
You!

Id: [0x001ECBCF]
You!

Id: [0x001ECBD9]
These look like the ruins Diona spoke about. Best be on my guard.

Id: [0x001ECBEF]
Poison... a coward's weapon.

Id: [0x001ECBF0]
Diona will want this back.

Id: [0x001ECC28]
With this, we can make sure all our priestesses are armed for battle. Excellent work, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001ECCAC]
Shh! Are you crazy?

Id: [0x001ECD96]
Good, come back when you're ready.

Id: [0x001ECD97]
All right, I'll be watching your back.

Id: [0x001ECD99]
Secure Kythera? I don't work for free.

Id: [0x001ECD9C]
And lastly. Poisoned blades are a priestess's weapon of choice.

Id: [0x001ECD9D]
If it's not the Cult, it's <i>malákes</i> bandits.

Id: [0x001ECDA4]
Such wisdom... I don't understand a word of it, but that's why she's in there and we're out here.

Id: [0x001ECDA6]
[&laughs]You were on Kephallonia for too long.

Id: [0x001ECDA7]
Then help us secure Kythera and root out the enemy.

Id: [0x001ECDA8]
By the Fates! You've seen what can happen, I can't do this on my own.

Id: [0x001ECDAC]
What else?

Id: [0x001ECDAD]
My sister believes she has leads on a traitor within our ranks. If that's true, she'll need your help. Look for her in the temple.

Id: [0x001ECDB0]
That's good news. You've dealt a heavy blow to the Cult's forces.

Id: [0x001ECDB1]
You're getting sexier by the minute. Anything else?

Id: [0x001ECDB2]
Well? What of my handmaiden?

Id: [0x001ECDB3]
Now we'll never know for sure if there is a traitor in our ranks.

Id: [0x001ED2D6]
Mercenaries attacked the wagons, not us!

Id: [0x001ED2DB]
Nikolaos of Sparta?

Id: [0x001ED2DC]
I have questions about my past. My <i>mater</i> has answers she kept from me that I need.

Id: [0x001ED2DE]
You should be cautious.

Id: [0x001ED2DF]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001ED2E0]
Think about your questions carefully. What we know about our past can shape our future.

Id: [0x001ED2E2]
I... haven't really thought about it.

Id: [0x001ED2E4]
Well, I'm sure you'll have plenty to talk about.

Id: [0x001ED2E8]
A misthios told us where to find the food. Everyone was already dead!

Id: [0x001ED2F1]
It was our food to begin with!

Id: [0x001ED2F6]
[beat]Thanks, Markos. I'll miss you too.

Id: [0x001ED312]
Please, let me plead our case?

Id: [0x001ED31E]
[beat]I'm just a kid. And I've done pretty good for myself.

Id: [0x001ED324]
Kynna will be fine, won't she? You just have to check on her in Kausos - that's all!

Id: [0x001ED509]
It's wise to keep your blades sheathed. Drawing blood in Delphi is considered an insult to Apollo. Punishment is severe.

Id: [0x001ED50F]
I don't know what you were thinking back there.

Id: [0x001ED510]
What, trying to save you?

Id: [0x001ED511]
That's not what that was. [beat]I told you to stay out of my way - yet here you are.

Id: [0x001ED513]
You're cold-blooded. I would've done the same - at Pylos. [beat]Of course, that's not the first time you cast me away to die.

Id: [0x001ED514]
[&scoff][scoffs][/&scoff]So that's what they told you.

Id: [0x001ED515]
It's what I <i>know</i>.

Id: [0x001ED518]
So, what? I'm a prisoner until I'm killed?

Id: [0x001ED519]
That's the plan. Or <i>I</i> could come in there and end you anytime I please.

Id: [0x001ED51B]
But before that. [beat]Tell me what you know.

Id: [0x001ED51C]
[&laughs]Fair point. Whoever did this was brazen and foolish... Leaving it to be so easily discovered.

Id: [0x001ED51D]
Or they wanted to send a message.

Id: [0x001ED540]
You think I'm just a puppet? Then prove it to me. Tell me why<i> I'm</i> on the wrong side. Convince me - I dare you.

Id: [0x001ED548]
I found some fragments of green crystal...

Id: [0x001ED549]
Bandits then! The mountains here are riddled with caves, and the war has made them brazen.

Id: [0x001ED54A]
I owe him a debt. From the past.

Id: [0x001ED54B]
Oh. [beat]Did you borrow drachmae<i>?</i>

Id: [0x001ED54C]
This line is ridiculous! Are there always this many people to see the Pythia?

Id: [0x001ED54D]
These are more than just people! Every city sends a <i>theoroi</i>, or sacred ambassadors, to seek guidance on behalf of their people. The Pythia not only shapes the destinies of individuals, but of the entire Greek world.

Id: [0x001ED54E]
Imagine what power one would have if they controlled what came out of her mouth.

Id: [0x001ED54F]
Apollo controls this!

Id: [0x001ED550]
Of course he does.

Id: [0x001ED55F]
Maybe you shouldn't let him do that.

Id: [0x001ED560]
Thanks for the advice.

Id: [0x001ED561]
You're welcome!

Id: [0x001ED588]
I take it you're the harbor master.

Id: [0x001ED589]
I told you, I'll pay when I get paid!

Id: [0x001ED58A]
Diona sent me. She said you needed help.

Id: [0x001ED58B]
Diona? Wait, wait, wait. Who are you?

Id: [0x001ED593]
This "Collector," where is he?

Id: [0x001ED594]
He lives in Gortyn near some red pillars, in a craaaaaazy house with lots of stuff!

Id: [0x001ED597]
... Fisherman's Beachhead in Heraklion would be your best bet. No one's seen him in years. Some think he's dead.

Id: [0x001ED59D]
I'll make sure they all talk.

Id: [0x001ED5AE]
I'm just helping her out. She has some information I want.

Id: [0x001ED5AF]
Liar! I bet you want <i>her</i> more than you want information, don't you?!

Id: [0x001ED5B0]
Just tell me what needs to be done.

Id: [0x001ED5B3]
Sounds like a job for another <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001ED5B4]
You're all the same.

Id: [0x001ED5C6]
Fine! You want to prove yourself to Diona, right? The military has been a real pain in the ass lately.

Id: [0x001ED8A7]
Freeing prisoners sounds treasonous. Why would she want to do that?

Id: [0x001ED8A8]
In her paranoia, the High Priestess has ordered anyone suspicious to be detained. But these prisoners were mercenaries minding their own business.

Id: [0x001ED8A9]
Still, Diona wants them to help fight against her enemies.

Id: [0x001ED8AB]
And let me guess, the only ones she can trust are those who can be bought with drachmae.

Id: [0x001ED8AD]
Ardos says his father is in the labyrinth. Is this true?

Id: [0x001ED8AE]
Yes, he never came out. Though two who did... will never truly escape it.

Id: [0x001ED8B0]
Is Diona someone special to you?

Id: [0x001ED8B1]
I-I'm her lover! And I'll be the one to help her get rid of her enemies! I promised that in exchange for -

Id: [0x001ED8B8]
I'm looking for Swordfish.

Id: [0x001ED8B9]
I-I know nothing!

Id: [0x001ED8BA]
I've got enough to go on. You better get my drachmae ready.

Id: [0x001ED8C5]
I'm looking for Swordfish. Can you help?

Id: [0x001ED8C6]
Piss off, <i>maláka</i>!

Id: [0x001ED8EC]
Look at you, a finely-tuned instrument of justice. Help us destroy this vile woman!

Id: [0x001ED903]
Did you get anything done yet?

Id: [0x001ED904]
They've captured some mercenaries who are of interest to her at the fortified warehouse. She needs you to free them.

Id: [0x001ED905]
I've freed the prisoners at the military camp.

Id: [0x001ED906]
Not all of them.

Id: [0x001ED910]
What do you know of the boy?

Id: [0x001ED913]
Breathe Collector, I've learned enough. If Theseus's armor is still in the fort, I'll find it.

Id: [0x001ED91E]
Describe these mercenaries to me.

Id: [0x001ED920]
They're all massive brutes. The kind you approach when you want things done.

Id: [0x001ED921]
Sounds familiar. I saved some earlier. As brutish as they come, and not a hair on their heads.

Id: [0x001ED924]
There were three of them, did you get them all?

Id: [0x001ED928]
Yeah - Swordfish.

Id: [0x001ED929]
I hope you know what you're in for. He's ruthless - cut off a man's nose just for sneezin'.

Id: [0x001ED92D]
Ha! I knew it.

Id: [0x001ED92F]
Yes, three of them in all their balding glory.

Id: [0x001ED930]
Why is it that every time I mention his name, people jump?

Id: [0x001ED931]
Swordfish controls Heraklion and everyone in it.

Id: [0x001ED932]
Guess you're more useful than you look. In that case, Diona needs one more task fulfilled.

Id: [0x001ED933]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x001ED935]
There are other tasks Diona needs me to do.

Id: [0x001ED936]
Diona needs <i>this</i> to be done quickly. Return to me soon.

Id: [0x001ED93B]
Where is he?

Id: [0x001ED93C]
No one's seen him in a long time.

Id: [0x001ED93E]
I'll keep that in mind -

Id: [0x001ED945]
I'm still paying "fees" to Swordfish. Hurry up and find his underwater hideout.

Id: [0x001ED94C]
Your hesitation is going to cost Kythera. Help us take out the enemy's captain on Chytra Atoll.

Id: [0x001ED94D]
You want me to go alone to an island swarming with enemies?

Id: [0x001ED94F]
Oh, is that too hard a task for Diona's new champion?

Id: [0x001ED950]
I will wipe the enemy off the face of that island.

Id: [0x001ED951]
Your humility is moving, <i>misthios</i>. But I wouldn't underestimate them.

Id: [0x001ED954]
Tread lightly.

Id: [0x001ED955]
No, it's <i>you</i> who underestimates <i>me</i>.

Id: [0x001ED957]
Enough pointless chatter!

Id: [0x001ED958]
Consider it done. What more can you tell me?

Id: [0x001ED95A]
I have other matters to see to.

Id: [0x001ED95B]
You're a waste of time, <i>misthios</i>! Diona needs this done.

Id: [0x001EDA07]
We've been expecting you. Please follow me.

Id: [0x001EDA08]
She's instructed me to take good care of you before she arrives.

Id: [0x001EDCA5]
Your shoulders must be aching. I'm sure I can help loosen you up before Diona arrives.

Id: [0x001EDCA7]
That's enough charades, priestess. We'll finish the job.

Id: [0x001EDCA8]
Diona's done with you, <i>misthios</i>! Now, die!

Id: [0x001EDCBD]
You! What's going on?

Id: [0x001EDCBE]
I-I was just doing as I was told. Diona told me to take you to the garden.

Id: [0x001EDCC0]
Please don't kill me.

Id: [0x001EDCC7]
W-what else do you want to know? I've told you everything!

Id: [0x001EDCD6]
Hey, <i>misthios</i>! Over here!

Id: [0x001EDCE3]
Do you really think Empedokles is a God?

Id: [0x001EDCE4]
I couldn't give a shit if he was a rooster - I'm just here to get away from the Priestesses.

Id: [0x001EDCED]
Praise Empedokles! Oh, oh, praise him!

Id: [0x001EDCF2]
Empedokles! Empedokles! Empedokles!

Id: [0x001EDD02]
Rejoice! For I, your humble god, shall introduce you to my brothers and sisters!

Id: [0x001EDD04]
That's a big promise.

Id: [0x001EDD05]
You doubt me?!

Id: [0x001EDD0B]
I doubt you could get us to the ocean. It's behind you, by the way.

Id: [0x001EDD0C]
How dare you mock - I - I'm a god! A <i>god</i>!

Id: [0x001EDD0E]
What am I?!

Id: [0x001EDD0F]
Thanks for clearing that up.

Id: [0x001EDD12]
A - a god?

Id: [0x001EDD1C]
I don't doubt the joy you've brought your followers.

Id: [0x001EDD1D]
Their loyalty will be rewarded. As will yours.

Id: [0x001EDD20]
We set sail for the Gulf of Korinth, and all the secrets she veils! Meet us there and see the truth for yourself.

Id: [0x001EDD22]
And meet your siblings? Wouldn't miss it.

Id: [0x001EDD24]
I've seen enough gods for one day.

Id: [0x001EDD2A]
Care to join me and my handsome followers for wine, merriment, and an audience with the gods?

Id: [0x001EDD2D]
To the Gulf of Korinth, and all she hides, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x001EDD39]
Empedokles smells exactly like a god ought to: honey, wine, and unchecked privilege!

Id: [0x001EDD3D]
Our master will send for us! He - he will return and fulfil his promise.

Id: [0x001EDD51]
...Wield fear as a weapon, may our enemies crumble...

Id: [0x001EDD74]
...Give us strength, when all of ours is gone...

Id: [0x001EDD7E]
This is it![heavy breathing] The realm of eternity, the house of the gods!

Id: [0x001EDD84]
Creators of the universe! Outstretch your mighty hands, and raise me to the heaven–

Id: [0x001EDD9E]
...Grant us the sight to watch over our legacy...

Id: [0x001EDDA9]
Be careful. That one-eyed brute has a nasty temper.

Id: [0x001EDDAE]
I see humility's important to you.

Id: [0x001EDDAF]
We'll see how that works in convincing me to do what you need.

Id: [0x001EDDB0]
My drachmae speak for themselves.

Id: [0x001EDDB1]
When you're wealthy, you can afford to be proud.

Id: [0x001EDDB7]
I'd watch your tongue, old man.

Id: [0x001EDE09]
I want to know about my real father.

Id: [0x001EDE0A]
Nikolaos was your father. He was the man who raised you... until he took his Spartan duty too far.

Id: [0x001EDE0B]
He mentioned another... What can you tell me about him?

Id: [0x001EDE0C]
He sought me out before I knew your fa... Nikolaos. I've not heard from him in a long time.

Id: [0x001EDE0E]
I always hoped you would never need to discover the truth, but there are things you need to know if we are to stop the Cult.

Id: [0x001EDE0F]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001EE370]
I don't know where the Cyclops lives.

Id: [0x001EE371]
Keep to the west side of the island... There, you will find his lair.

Id: [0x001EE4BC]
Who is attacking?

Id: [0x001EE4BE]
Why now?

Id: [0x001EE4C0]
I guess the time for talking is over.

Id: [0x001EE505]
What happened to you in Argolis after that night?

Id: [0x001EE506]
I found your brother and rushed to a young doctor's apprentice, Hippokrates. I thought I'd lost you... I wasn't ready to lose you both.

Id: [0x001EE507]
I spoke with him recently. That night still haunts him.

Id: [0x001EE508]
I was heartbroken when the healers in Asclepius told me Alexios was dead. The two of you were my whole world.

Id: [0x001EE509]
But he did live, they lied to you.

Id: [0x001EE50A]
They... must have realized he was special and handed him over to the Cult.

Id: [0x001EE50B]
What do you mean, he was special?

Id: [0x001EE547]
Besides, I'll have Kynna to play with - since you saved her!

Id: [0x001EE548]
Go easy on her. She may still be shaky with the fever.

Id: [0x001EE54A]
Nikolaos might have played the part of my father, but he wasn't. He tried to kill me.

Id: [0x001EE54B]
What he did was wrong, Kassandra. I hated him for it, but he did love you in his own way - I can assure you of that.

Id: [0x001EE566]
What's going on?

Id: [0x001EE567]
We will bring this evil Creature to justice!

Id: [0x001EE569]
Hold your forked tongue!

Id: [0x001EE56B]
She just looks scared to me.

Id: [0x001EE57B]
You mentioned a "Ligeia." She's -

Id: [0x001EE57C]
Beyond beauty, beyond grace... A Daughter of Artemis. Brave - not like me.

Id: [0x001EE589]
How can I repay you?

Id: [0x001EE59B]
The gods wait for no one.

Id: [0x001EE59C]
Patience is not one of our virtues, no. Will you help?

Id: [0x001EE5A4]
The gods would protect themselves with more than a locked door opened by a disk.

Id: [0x001EE5A5]
Oh but you should see the door, misthios! Something so beautiful was not crafted by mortal hands! And my brothers, my sisters, I hear them calling me home from beyond it...

Id: [0x001EE5A6]
What are your godly brothers and sisters really like, Empedokles?

Id: [0x001EE5A7]
As any sibling - loving. Filled with strife. They once caught me eating lamb and cast me out. Though between you and me, that lamb? Worth it.

Id: [0x001EE5AE]
I'll return with the disk.

Id: [0x001EE5B0]
Was your god not clear?

Id: [0x001EE5B2]
Just wait till you see what it unlocks! You could say it's KEY to my plan!

Id: [0x001EE5C6]
Praise the gods! Here's a reward for your troubles.

Id: [0x001EE5CF]
Ah, look how she strides! The confidence! If I didn't know better, I'd say there were <i>two</i> gods on Kythera!

Id: [0x001EE5D0]
I found your disk.

Id: [0x001EE5D1]
Praise <i>me</i>! Clearly, I have worked through you!

Id: [0x001EE5DD]
What exactly is this Creature?

Id: [0x001EE5DE]
We must end this girl before she leads the Writhing Dread right to us!

Id: [0x001EE5E3]
Beyond the Petrified Temple, north of here. A damned place, haunted by shade and filled with cursed stone... At its center lie ancient ruins, from which few return.

Id: [0x001EE5E4]
The forest where the Creature lives - where is it?

Id: [0x001EE5FB]
I hear you my brothers, my sisters!

Id: [0x001EE5FD]
Someone sounds very stompy today. I'd know that temper anywhere, Ares. Do not fear brother, I shall comfort you soon!

Id: [0x001EE5FF]
Please... my family, let me come home.

Id: [0x001EE604]
"Do not trust the Fates"!

Id: [0x001EE605]
How could you possibly know that?

Id: [0x001EE606]
Her end must've been so tragic she renounced the Fates. The poor girl, it was all my fault.

Id: [0x001EE607]
I sent her to spy on you, and you had her killed when she threatened to expose you!

Id: [0x001EE610]
You see! They're here! The - the gods are. Behind. This. Door! Listen.

Id: [0x001EE611]
I didn't mean to be away so long. Kythera is - well, if you're looking to unleash a new plague somewhere -

Id: [0x001EE612]
This is not what I expected.

Id: [0x001EE613]
Camouflage, my unimaginative friend! A mere disguise to ward off those seeking the glory inside!

Id: [0x001EE616]
Ah! You hear them too!

Id: [0x001EE61D]
Clearly. Time to meet the gods, then?

Id: [0x001EE61E]
I'd love to introduce you to my family - of course, if you're ready to join me?

Id: [0x001EE61F]
There is something there, and whatever's making that noise must be two or three times the size of a man.

Id: [0x001EE620]
Quickly, use the disk! Open the door! They're expecting us.

Id: [0x001EE622]
There is something in there, Empedokles, but it's bigger than Aphrodite's welcoming bosom.

Id: [0x001EE623]
They're preparing our welcome! Quickly, <i>misthios</i>! We cannot delay!

Id: [0x001EE646]
There! See that island. [beat]That is where I saw the beast.

Id: [0x001EE657]
[beat]How did you know?

Id: [0x001EE658]
I was told.

Id: [0x001EE659]
Nikolaos? You saw him?

Id: [0x001EE65A]
In Megaris, yes.

Id: [0x001EE672]
I know, I know. It's a lot to take in all at once. Come.

Id: [0x001EE676]
There's always been a rivalry between the islands. After all, Naxos used to control Paros and Andros. They're envious of our craftsmen too.

Id: [0x001EE677]
And now?

Id: [0x001EE678]
They think they "deserve" expansion. Their oligarch demands their wings spread wide.

Id: [0x001EE679]
But we'll clip their wings before that happens.

Id: [0x001EE67A]
They don't know who they're up against.

Id: [0x001EE681]
This is sacred ground. You should not be here.

Id: [0x001EE683]
Well? Either leave or tell me what you want. Who are you?

Id: [0x001EE68B]
A <i>misthios</i>. I'm not here to start trouble, but if that's what you want, I'll end it.

Id: [0x001EE68C]
Your name.

Id: [0x001EE690]
I mean no disrespect.

Id: [0x001EE691]
Then answer my questions. Who are you?

Id: [0x001EE698]
So you're the one Thalia spoke of, and it was you who slew the unkillable?

Id: [0x001EE699]
It was tough, but not unkillable. I'm Kassandra.

Id: [0x001EE69A]
I am Daphnae, leader of the Daughters of Artemis, and <i>you</i> [beat]are maybe exactly who I've been looking for.

Id: [0x001EE6A3]
And who would that be?

Id: [0x001EE6A4]
A warrior, a hunter. One who straddles our world and the gods'. One who will meet my challenge.

Id: [0x001EE6AB]
When you put it like that, how could I not accept?

Id: [0x001EE6AC]
There is a boar not too far from here. Kill it, then bring me its pelt.

Id: [0x001EE6B0]
Keep looking.

Id: [0x001EE6B7]
I...

Id: [0x001EE6BE]
I'll return with your boar pelt soon enough.

Id: [0x001EE6C6]
Did you get lost?

Id: [0x001EE6C9]
Have you reconsidered my offer?

Id: [0x001EE6CC]
I don't want it.

Id: [0x001EE6CD]
Well, you fuckin' <i>have </i>to want it. Cuz I say so! Take it!

Id: [0x001EE6D0]
Anything you can tell me that might help?

Id: [0x001EE6D1]
The area is hotly contested, but Sparta is winning. We're pushing the Athenians back, but due to the war the forests and mountains have become a hive for bandits and mercenaries.

Id: [0x001EE6D2]
I mean about where your <i>spy</i> might have gone.

Id: [0x001EE6D3]
He's injured, and there's a spring up there in the forest. If it was me I would have headed there.

Id: [0x001EE6D4]
I'll be back soon with your tablet.

Id: [0x001EE6D5]
The mountains and forest of Megaris are dangerous, and he surely didn't work alone.

Id: [0x001EE6D6]
I'm more than capable of handling your spy. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x001EE6D7]
Did you see which direction he went?

Id: [0x001EE6D8]
The men said he went towards the hill, easier to avoid pursuit in that terrain.

Id: [0x001EE6E7]
You got it?

Id: [0x001EE6E8]
Could have been worse, you could have failed. Then you would have had to face Hyrkanos!

Id: [0x001EE6EB]
Smile. Hyrkanos is generous to those who succeed.

Id: [0x001EE6EC]
Yes! And I need help, the idiots stuck me while making my escape.

Id: [0x001EE7E8]
Shit!

Id: [0x001EE7EA]
Yes... But did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x001EE7EB]
Oh, er, yes. Of course.

Id: [0x001EE7EC]
Thank you.

Id: [0x001EE7EF]
Here, I killed your piggy for you.

Id: [0x001EE7F1]
Hmm. You are skilled, of that there is no doubt.

Id: [0x001EE7FF]
Now leave me alone.

Id: [0x001EE802]
May Apollo light your way.

Id: [0x001EE803]
You also know what a pig's education he has had!

Id: [0x001EE809]
Now go. You bring nothing but darkness with you.

Id: [0x001EE80C]
May Apollo protect you.

Id: [0x001EE813]
I know what it's like to want to leave Kephallonia.

Id: [0x001EE814]
Who wouldn't? We have nothing here. As many vegetables as we please, but no hope.

Id: [0x001EE818]
If it's so valuable, why wouldn't I just keep it for myself?

Id: [0x001EE81A]
A good deed? A gesture of goodwill? An escape from our life of produce?

Id: [0x001EE8E7]
Hey, get me out of here!

Id: [0x001EE8EA]
It was the Pythia's prophecy. The Spartan ephors said there was no other choice.

Id: [0x001EE8EB]
A prophecy?

Id: [0x001EE8F1]
The Pythia said you were going to bring Sparta to greatness, or to its downfall. Waiting for the outcome was too big a risk.

Id: [0x001EE8F8]
No one told you that I tried to save you? I ran to catch you. I <i>killed</i> an elder. That ended my life, too.

Id: [0x001EE8F9]
Always trying to play the "hero." It wasn't enough then, and it isn't enough now.

Id: [0x001EE901]
Listen. After you and the elder fell, they threw me off Mount Taygetos, too. <i>Pater</i>... let me go. It was his "duty."

Id: [0x001EE903]
You were abandoned, too.

Id: [0x001EE904]
They've kept things from both of us.

Id: [0x001EE906]
How many more secrets am I supposed to take? When will I get the truth?

Id: [0x001EE907]
If the Cult had their way, they'd be using both of us.

Id: [0x001EE909]
No, they will kill you. [&scoff]Use me? They need me.

Id: [0x001EE90E]
The Cult took you for themselves. To mold you into something they could use.

Id: [0x001EE914]
They want our family gone - all of us. Not one of us left.

Id: [0x001EE916]
And they built a machine.

Id: [0x001EE917]
They don't care what happens to us.

Id: [0x001EE91B]
Gods are cruel.

Id: [0x001EE91C]
They want control. Over everything. The people, Athens... they won't stop.

Id: [0x001EE92B]
At what cost?

Id: [0x001EE940]
Thousands of Spartans depend on Lagos for food and protection. His death would bring chaos.

Id: [0x001EE943]
The Archon stores his wheat in Pan's Cradle. Set the silos alight, and his livelihood will go up in smoke.

Id: [0x001EE9CC]
The Pythia said you wouldn't survive. You wouldn't be a good Spartan.

Id: [0x001EE9CE]
<i>Maláka! </i>And your bones are made of gold? [beat]They threw off the wrong child - I'm glad to be nothing like you.

Id: [0x001EE9D0]
<i>Mater</i> went after you.

Id: [0x001EE9DE]
...Outwit our oppressors, hide our truth within lies...

Id: [0x001EE9E2]
She found the truth. The Cult wanted you so badly they'd do anything to have you.

Id: [0x001EE9E3]
They did what she never did. They raised me.

Id: [0x001EE9EF]
They use you as their weapon. But as soon as you lose your edge, you're out.

Id: [0x001EE9FA]
I'm the best weapon they have. Except no one manipulates me - no one tells me to kill.

Id: [0x001EE9FC]
Either way, where the others saw a weakling, the Cult saw something different.

Id: [0x001EEA08]
She brought you to a priest to be healed, but he told her you died.

Id: [0x001EEA0A]
I wasn't her only child. Not everything was lost.

Id: [0x001EEA0B]
No, all was lost. Everything we ever knew.

Id: [0x001EEA0C]
What do you know? You know <i>nothing</i> of what I've had to do.

Id: [0x001EEA0F]
After that, we weren't Spartan anymore. We were banished by the ephors and targeted by the Cult.

Id: [0x001EEA11]
If they have me, they don't need the rest of you.

Id: [0x001EEA16]
"Abandon you?" Is that what you call it?

Id: [0x001EEA17]
They decreed my fate, and you accepted it.

Id: [0x001EEA20]
The Cult didn't see it that way.

Id: [0x001EEA28]
Ask the people who want me dead. Who treat you like a fucking god.

Id: [0x001EEA29]
You dare insult the ones who <i>didn't</i> leave me to die?

Id: [0x001EEA2B]
<i>Pater</i> made the final decision. He was bound to Sparta.

Id: [0x001EEA2D]
Of course he was wrong. A father? It's laughable.

Id: [0x001EEAD6]
...Ligeia?

Id: [0x001EEAD8]
[gasps]No!

Id: [0x001EEADC]
Ligeia, it's me, Bryce!

Id: [0x001EEAF6]
As if that's a bad thing.

Id: [0x001EEB08]
See, told you we backed the right horse.

Id: [0x001EEB09]
All right, all right, no need to keep going on about it! I admit it, Hyrkanos has done right by us.

Id: [0x001EEB0A]
Working for the Athenians is like having a real job.

Id: [0x001EEB0B]
True. Food, shelter, fighting... Better than that military bullshit.

Id: [0x001EEB0C]
[laugh]Fuck them and their parading around!

Id: [0x001EEB0D]
Shh, did you hear something?

Id: [0x001EEB0E]
Probably just the wolves. This shithole is full of 'em.

Id: [0x001EEB13]
And get a beating? Fuck that, just keep your eyes open.

Id: [0x001EEB14]
Now this time I did hear something... Do you think we should tell Hyrkanos?

Id: [0x001EEB3E]
Where exactly are Lagos's guards stationed?

Id: [0x001EEB41]
I'll go see what Lagos is up to.

Id: [0x001EEB42]
Good luck, my lamb.

Id: [0x001EEB5D]
They know the power of Athens. Look around you - they were scared.

Id: [0x001EEB5E]
Athens is crumbling. Kleon has the power now.

Id: [0x001EEB5F]
Until they kill every enemy - until they kill me - they don't have Athens.

Id: [0x001EEB60]
But they <i>will </i>claim it.

Id: [0x001EEB6A]
You're being used. You wouldn't be here with me if you thought they were telling you the whole truth.

Id: [0x001EEB6B]
Here's the truth. If all they wanted was a soldier, there are <i>thousands</i>. They want me, and only me.

Id: [0x001EEB7F]
Where can I find one of these cloaks and masks?

Id: [0x001EEB81]
There is a man, he visits me from time to time. Makes sure I'm well taken care of. I have the biggest house in the Chora of Delphi, yet he still offers drachmae for my troubles. Gives me the creeps.

Id: [0x001EEB82]
What's his name?

Id: [0x001EEB83]
Elpenor.

Id: [0x001EEB84]
Elpenor! He's with the Cult?

Id: [0x001EEB85]
I can't be sure, but if he is, he would definitely have what you require.

Id: [0x001EEBA1]
Some rest their heads at a barracks in Tegea. There's also a camp and a fort in Smuggler's Forest. Destroy his guards there, and his defenses will be weakened.

Id: [0x001EEBA3]
Tell me where to find the silos.

Id: [0x001EEBB4]
Oh? And what do you have in mind?

Id: [0x001EEBB5]
But first, to business. There are beasts that roam this world, but are not fully of it. They've been placed here by the gods as trials - as tests.

Id: [0x001EEBBE]
All right, I'll do it. Now, just how many of these animals are there?

Id: [0x001EEBC6]
I'm not hunting or killing anything for you.

Id: [0x001EEBCC]
Are ready to begin the hunt?

Id: [0x001EEBD2]
What were you expecting?

Id: [0x001EEBD3]
I don't know. Something more grand. My parents named me Odessa... I'm Odysseus's namesake. I thought if I came here I might... understand him more.

Id: [0x001EEBD4]
Well, do you?

Id: [0x001EEBD5]
Not at all... Take me to my boat. I'll pay you there.

Id: [0x001EEBD7]
Why is that place so important to you?

Id: [0x001EEBD8]
Are you joking? Odysseus <i>lived</i> there. Ruled there. He ended the Trojan war. Eluded Skylla and Charybdis. He had everything. Loyalty. Love. Fighting spirit!

Id: [0x001EEBD9]
He had the attention of the gods, too. That caused him a lot of trouble.

Id: [0x001EEBDB]
This... is it? It's just rubble.

Id: [0x001EEBE1]
I know you left Sparta, but how did you end up  on this island?

Id: [0x001EEBE2]
I couldn't stand by Nikolaos after what he did - I had to get out of Sparta.

Id: [0x001EEBE5]
So why here?

Id: [0x001EEBE6]
I saw an opportunity to help people, to grow something. I was elected to rule and protect this island from those who would ruin what we've built.

Id: [0x001EEBE9]
Let's continue this discussion somewhere the smell of death doesn't linger.

Id: [0x001EEBEA]
Ride with me.

Id: [0x001EEC00]
I don't understand why the Cult targeted our family.

Id: [0x001EEC01]
There are many reasons, lamb.

Id: [0x001EEC02]
What did we ever do to them?

Id: [0x001EEC03]
Now that we're reunited, it's more a question of what we <i>could</i> do to them.

Id: [0x001EEC04]
They fear us.

Id: [0x001EEC05]
Your ancestors have been a thorn in their side for generations. They've decided we need to be eliminated to ensure their plans come to fruition.

Id: [0x001EEC06]
If it's our family they fear, we'll reunite and give them a reason to be afraid.

Id: [0x001EEC16]
Welcome back, lamb.

Id: [0x001EEC17]
I had some more questions...

Id: [0x001EEC1E]
What a strange day it has been.

Id: [0x001EEC1F]
But a good one.

Id: [0x001EEC20]
I've certainly had worse.

Id: [0x001EEC21]
Me too.

Id: [0x001EEC22]
You have grown into a remarkable woman, but I see the burden you carry on your shoulders.

Id: [0x001EEC23]
Finding you has lessened it, I think.

Id: [0x001EEC24]
I'm glad, but I have wondered why the gods chose to reunite us now.

Id: [0x001EEC28]
I think they felt it was about time our family found each other again.

Id: [0x001EEC2A]
If we want to be truly united, we have to find Alexios and rescue him from the Cult's grasp.

Id: [0x001EEC2B]
So we can destroy the Cult once and for all.

Id: [0x001EEC2C]
If only it were that simple. You are mighty, but we cannot stop them alone.

Id: [0x001EEC2F]
They are the source of all our pain and they will cause more to many others unless we act.

Id: [0x001EEC30]
I put that life behind me the moment I left Sparta. I have Naxos to worry about now.

Id: [0x001EEC31]
Let me help you here. We can safeguard Naxos and then hunt down the Cult together.

Id: [0x001EEC3B]
Myrrine, the symposium is about to start.

Id: [0x001EEC3E]
By the gods! I'm sorry my sweet, I forgot. Prepare the horses - I'll be out shortly.

Id: [0x001EEC41]
I will help you stop the Cult, but before I can leave Naxos I have to ensure it will survive without me.

Id: [0x001EEC42]
What do you need?

Id: [0x001EEC43]
Paros has to be dealt with. We need to weaken their position. Once they're vulnerable, they will make a reckless decision, and we will strike.

Id: [0x001EEC44]
Don't worry, I'll find him.

Id: [0x001EEC49]
If you need me, I'll be at the symposium. Although... try to look less intimidating should you choose to pay me a visit.

Id: [0x001EEC81]
His favorite fishing spot is on the west coast of Anaphi, north of here.

Id: [0x001EEC82]
If he's alive, I'll find him.

Id: [0x001EEE92]
Then we must weaken his defenses.

Id: [0x001EEFAC]
And what if Brasidas's plan doesn't work?

Id: [0x001EEFAD]
The Archon hides like a coward in Fort Samikon. You can't miss that monstrosity. You could go after him now, but be careful - he's well-defended.

Id: [0x001EEFCB]
I have plenty of talents, of that you can be sure.

Id: [0x001EEFCC]
Oh, is that so? Well, I look forward to putting them all to the test.

Id: [0x001EEFD2]
You shouldn't doubt my abilities.

Id: [0x001EEFD3]
Lesson learned. But I'm also interested in seeing what else you can do.

Id: [0x001EF0AC]
He's got barracks full of guards and silos full of grain...

Id: [0x001EF1C3]
May the gods guide you.

Id: [0x001EF1C4]
<i>Chaire</i>, stranger.

Id: [0x001EF1C5]
We're done here.

Id: [0x001EF1C6]
May the Fates be on your side.

Id: [0x001EF1C7]
I should get going.

Id: [0x001EF1CD]
So, these sapphires are <i>really</i> valuable, right?

Id: [0x001EF1CF]
Great to see you again, Photios. Savor your retirement.

Id: [0x001EF1D3]
[&ah]You spawn of a salty slimeworm, you have them already, don't you? Hand them over. And don't you dare tell me I can't pay you.

Id: [0x001EF41C]
Chaaaarrrge!

Id: [0x001EF41D]
Yaaaaaahhhhhh!

Id: [0x001EF420]
...Aw.

Id: [0x001EF4D4]
Phoibe! No, no, no, no, no. No. Ela[Come on], ela[come on].

Id: [0x001EFA0A]
You mentioned I should talk to Drakios about officially entering the Battle. Where can I find him?

Id: [0x001EFA27]
Are you ready to meet my family? I've told them so much about you!

Id: [0x001EFA2C]
My brothers and sisters!

Id: [0x001EFA36]
Empedokles is already in the cave! He prepares the way for us!

Id: [0x001EFA40]
Whatever's inside, I'm ready.

Id: [0x001EFA41]
I'll be back.

Id: [0x001EFA44]
Hurry! We don't want to keep Ares waiting! Believe me.

Id: [0x001EFAEC]
Ha! I have a highly lucrative job offer - a dangerous one, too. If you had fear in your heart, you might not be fit for the task at hand.

Id: [0x001EFB09]
I need skins to make some breastplates. The best come from Chios island, north of Chios city. I'll make one for you too, if you get them for me.

Id: [0x001EFB0F]
Do you have fear in your heart?

Id: [0x001EFB10]
I should cut out yours just for asking.

Id: [0x001EFB15]
Nobody scares me.

Id: [0x001EFB16]
Ah... but I'm not talking about a person. I'm talking about the most dangerous and unpredictable creatures alive... bears.

Id: [0x001EFB18]
What do you want with them?

Id: [0x001EFB1A]
I'll get the bear skins for you.

Id: [0x001EFB1B]
Excellent. If you survive, I'll reward you with the finest breastplate ever created.

Id: [0x001EFB22]
Bears are not my business.

Id: [0x001EFB23]
...Then how will I make the breastplate?!

Id: [0x001EFB26]
Misthios! Have you reconsidered my offer? I need bear skins to make that breastplate!

Id: [0x001EFB29]
Fear is natural - it helps us survive.

Id: [0x001EFB2A]
Ah. But survival is never guaranteed when facing bears!

Id: [0x001EFB2E]
Bring me back bear skins from Chios island, and I'll make you the finest breastplate in existence.

Id: [0x001EFB36]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x001EFB37]
I've dedicated my life to becoming a Daughter of Artemis, but they said I'm not tough enough to join them.

Id: [0x001EFB3E]
It's human nature to want to fit in.

Id: [0x001EFB3F]
Being part of something is all I've ever wanted. Now I'm just a feather on the wind.

Id: [0x001EFB63]
The message said to meet him at our old house[2401651] northeast of here, near Phaistos.

Id: [0x001EFB6B]
I don't have time to train.

Id: [0x001EFB71]
Following others is a sign of weakness.

Id: [0x001EFB73]
But I've followed Artemis for so long...

Id: [0x001EFB75]
Your life is your own. If you've lost your purpose, find another one.

Id: [0x001EFB76]
A new life purpose? I wouldn't even know where to begin.

Id: [0x001EFB77]
I'll join them anyway! I'll infiltrate their village[2416852] and live among them. Can you help me? I'll pay you all the drachmae I have.

Id: [0x001EFB7F]
Like I said, the Daughters of Artemis are dangerous. It's time to move on.

Id: [0x001EFB80]
I'll help you.

Id: [0x001EFB83]
The Daughters of Artemis are dangerous, and if you're found out...

Id: [0x001EFB84]
I accept the risks. What I'll need you to do is get me a piece of their armor, headgear, and boots.

Id: [0x001EFB87]
I can't. I <i>need</i> to do this. If you change your mind, I'll be waiting.

Id: [0x001EFB8B]
You came back! Have you decided to help me?

Id: [0x001EFB9C]
Where can I find the boots?

Id: [0x001EFB9D]
There's a cave[2106094] in the cliffs on the western side of the Daughters' village where they train new recruits. <LF>

Id: [0x001EFB9E]
Any idea where I can find the armor you need?

Id: [0x001EFB9F]
There's a small outpost camp[2392896] just south of the Daughters' village. You'll find extra armor there. They barely defend it -

Id: [0x001EFBA0]
I'll come back when I have the gear.

Id: [0x001EFBA1]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. You'll have to be stealthy to get the items, and please avoid harming any of the Daughters if you can.

Id: [0x001EFBA2]
Did you gather all the items I need?

Id: [0x001EFBAB]
There's a high price to pay for chasing what we want - maybe even death. You must be willing to pay it.

Id: [0x001EFBAE]
Yes. This is something I must do.

Id: [0x001EFBB0]
Find a new path that lets you really live.

Id: [0x001EFBB1]
Really? You think <i>I</i> could do that?

Id: [0x001EFBBB]
I knew it would come to this. The Daughters killed her for infiltrating them.

Id: [0x001EFC5D]
But some bandits sacked our apothecaries and have taken refuge in the Mycenaean ruins.

Id: [0x001EFC5E]
Perhaps you could aid me in another matter?

Id: [0x001EFC6A]
A <i>misthios</i> indeed.

Id: [0x001EFC6B]
But first!

Id: [0x001EFC6D]
Nice to see you again, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001EFC7A]
Do you have the skins?

Id: [0x001EFC82]
I imagine this information would be useful to you.

Id: [0x001EFC8F]
I'm only here for information on the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x001EFC90]
Just three simple tasks.

Id: [0x001EFC92]
Excellent, so what needs to be done?

Id: [0x001EFC9C]
A moment please while I address my audience.

Id: [0x001EFCB4]
W-what? That can't be! Who is it? You must tell me, or I won't know who to trust.

Id: [0x001EFCB5]
We don't know yet. But your sister is looking into it.

Id: [0x001EFCB6]
Your sister has definite proof of a traitor.

Id: [0x001EFCC3]
This should be interesting.

Id: [0x001EFCE5]
Are you ready to face your destiny?

Id: [0x001EFD22]
Why did they attack me? I freed these men myself!

Id: [0x001EFD23]
Diona played you like she did the High Priestess. The captain you killed was a leader for her sister's reinforcements.

Id: [0x001EFD24]
A-and the poison was to be used against you if you proved too dangerous.

Id: [0x001EFD25]
I'll show that snake exactly how dangerous I am.

Id: [0x001EFD26]
What?

Id: [0x001EFD2D]
I've got the gear you asked for, but remember - the Daughters of Artemis are legendary warriors. If you choose to infiltrate them, it's likely you'll be killed.

Id: [0x001EFD2E]
What choice do I have?

Id: [0x001EFD3D]
We'll send a fat amount of drachmae to your ship when you're done.

Id: [0x001EFDDB]
I was told to come here and speak to Daphnae.

Id: [0x001EFDE4]
Oh, is that all you need?

Id: [0x001EFDE5]
Don't worry, I'll reward you well. I'm sure Koragos will be thankful also.

Id: [0x001EFDE6]
I'll be back with the ingredients soon.

Id: [0x001EFDFC]
Choose your question wisely, mortal. For you have but one. Speak truth seeker!

Id: [0x001EFE01]
Please, I've come this far. You must have the answers I seek.

Id: [0x001EFE04]
The Battle of One Hundred Hands draws warriors from all corners of the Greek world to compete for a large purse. But as competitions go, it's also very deadly - a last person standing type of affair.

Id: [0x001EFE64]
[O.S.]I won't be intimidated. Stock the barracks...

Id: [0x001EFE7A]
If you're going to die, take three of them with you!

Id: [0x001EFE7B]
Glory is yours Spartans! Rip it from their throats!

Id: [0x001EFE7F]
Xerxes sent his sheep to slaughter!

Id: [0x001EFE83]
Crows will feast on the corpse of your king!

Id: [0x001EFE8A]
Run your steel through their skulls!

Id: [0x001EFE8B]
Your king picked a fight with the wrong army!

Id: [0x001EFE8C]
I will feed your heart to my dogs!

Id: [0x001EFE8D]
Today I'll get drunk on Spartan blood!<LF>

Id: [0x001EFE8E]
Your gods have abandoned you. I'll make sure they hear your screams.

Id: [0x001EFE8F]
I will bring Xerxes your head!

Id: [0x001EFE92]
This is devastating news. Do you understand what this means? Through her, the Cult controls the world.

Id: [0x001EFE95]
My men will tear the life from your throats!

Id: [0x001EFE96]
Many of you have come, none will return!

Id: [0x001EFE9A]
Shield the man beside you, kill the man in front of you!

Id: [0x001EFE9B]
The gates of Hades will overflow with Persian blood!

Id: [0x001EFEC1]
This pigment is only used in the graffiti. Has anyone been buying this from you?

Id: [0x001EFEC2]
Hmmm, I do remember a man asking about this color now that you mention it.

Id: [0x001EFEC3]
Just him?

Id: [0x001EFEC4]
Yes from what I remember. I didn't have any when he asked. He seemed impatient and asked if anyone else sold it.

Id: [0x001EFEC6]
I found this hair stuck in the paint of the graffiti. Does it mean anything to you?

Id: [0x001EFEC7]
Many artists here on Naxos use wild animal hairs to form the bristles of their paint brushes.

Id: [0x001EFEC8]
What animal is this hair from?

Id: [0x001EFEC9]
It's too long to be a deer. I've heard that some thrill-seekers like to get hairs from the bears that live on the island. They're mad if you ask me, but artists are an unusual sort.

Id: [0x001EFEEC]
RRRRRRAAAAAAAA!

Id: [0x001EFEED]
Come you dogs, look death in the eye! Alalalalaaa!

Id: [0x001EFEEE]
Defy them! For Spartaaaa!

Id: [0x001EFF20]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>! You must help me.

Id: [0x001EFF21]
Must I?

Id: [0x001EFF49]
All right. I'll help you, but...

Id: [0x001EFF4B]
But what?

Id: [0x001EFF4D]
I'm not Kephallonian.

Id: [0x001EFF5F]
So, tell me everything.

Id: [0x001EFF60]
[&laughs]Everything?[/&laughs] I wouldn't even know where to start.

Id: [0x001EFF63]
Somewhere in the middle then.

Id: [0x001EFF64]
Well, I went to my first symposium.

Id: [0x001EFF65]
[&laughs]I'm so sorry.

Id: [0x001EFF66]
Oh, it wasn't that bad... Not really.

Id: [0x001EFF6D]
So, tell me everything.

Id: [0x001EFF6E]
[&laughs]Everything? [/&laughs]I wouldn't even know where to start.

Id: [0x001EFF71]
Somewhere in the middle then.

Id: [0x001EFF72]
Well, I went to my first symposium.

Id: [0x001EFF73]
I'm so sorry.

Id: [0x001EFF74]
Oh, it wasn't that bad... Not really.

Id: [0x001EFF7C]
The bounty is lifted - Lagos is alive.

Id: [0x001EFF7D]
See? [&laughs]I knew we could solve this without violence.

Id: [0x001EFF7F]
That Cultist deserved to die.

Id: [0x001EFF84]
He's dead.

Id: [0x001EFFA1]
Lagos is no longer with the Cult. I convinced him he's safer without them.

Id: [0x001EFFA4]
Lagos was a <i>victim</i> of the Cult. He shouldn't share their fate.

Id: [0x001EFFA6]
The Cult of Kosmos would eat their own young if it served their needs!

Id: [0x001EFFB1]
So it's done. I suppose you'll be wanting to report the news to Sparta soon.

Id: [0x001EFFBD]
And you want me to rescue him.

Id: [0x001EFFBE]
Bring him to me with not a hair on his head disturbed, and I'll pay you well.

Id: [0x001EFFDC]
Well what are you waiting for? My brother's in a cage, and I'm getting eaten alive by bugs!

Id: [0x001EFFFB]
Open their throats! Stain the earth!

Id: [0x001F0058]
Initials carved into stone... A record of Bryce and Ligeia's love.

Id: [0x001F005D]
Romantic letters.

Id: [0x001F0062]
A poem. "Someone, I tell you, in another time will remember us."

Id: [0x001F0068]
Iris be praised! I've spotted our shipwrecked fisherman.

Id: [0x001F00A2]
Nothing special about this spear.

Id: [0x001F00A9]
Not many places for a handmaiden to hide in the outskirts of the city. This must be it.

Id: [0x001F00B0]
Fucking bandits! I'll cut you all down!

Id: [0x001F00B5]
Get me out of here. Quick, before the guards return!

Id: [0x001F00C0]
They'll execute me! I did nothing wrong!

Id: [0x001F00CB]
I won't die here, <i>misthios</i>. Let me out!

Id: [0x001F00D0]
Swordfish... even his name -

Id: [0x001F00D3]
Tell me about Swordfish.

Id: [0x001F01A3]
Your insults may be strong, and - and quite hurtful, but my devotion to the god Empedokles is stronger!

Id: [0x001F01A7]
Your false god, this "Empedokles," is a delusional vegetarian. His presence, and yours, will not be tolerated.

Id: [0x001F01BA]
Where can I find this god of yours?

Id: [0x001F01BB]
They have him locked in a cage in Skandeia Bay with the livestock. This would be shameful for any regular god, and more so for a vegetarian god!

Id: [0x001F01BC]
Does he stand out in any way? There may be more than one prisoner.

Id: [0x001F01BD]
The guards stripped him naked. And when you are confronted with his "gift," Empedokles's godly nature will be hard to deny.

Id: [0x001F01C0]
Have you saved Empedokles? My god deserves freedom!

Id: [0x001F01C1]
I know all I need. Your Empedokles will be freed.

Id: [0x001F01C7]
What did the gods look like, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001F01CB]
I can't wait to meet Hermes! He's my favorite of Empedokles's brothers.

Id: [0x001F01D0]
I bet Empedokles is enjoying a wonderful reunion with his family.

Id: [0x001F01DD]
I'll help you. How often do you get to help a god?

Id: [0x001F01DE]
Of <i>my</i> caliber? Never!

Id: [0x001F01DF]
I'm busy.

Id: [0x001F01E0]
What could possibly be more important than an audience with the gods?!

Id: [0x001F01E3]
That, my dear <i>misthios</i>, I can absolutely guarantee.

Id: [0x001F01E4]
First, I have other matters to attend to.

Id: [0x001F01E5]
Matters more important than meeting the gods?! Your life must be a blessed adventure.

Id: [0x001F01E6]
Change your mind about helping me save my <i>pater</i>?

Id: [0x001F01F1]
I hear you're lookin' for… <i>a certain fish</i>.

Id: [0x001F0289]
Beast slayer! I'm glad to see you.

Id: [0x001F028A]
Daphnae. I didn't think you would be.

Id: [0x001F028B]
The path I set you on is fraught with danger. You could have been killed, or given up.

Id: [0x001F028E]
No danger could have kept me from seeing you again.

Id: [0x001F0290]
Maybe, you're getting ahead of yourself. [beat]Maybe...

Id: [0x001F0297]
There's nothing I've faced that I haven't overcome.

Id: [0x001F0298]
Be careful. Pride is a shield of reeds. It can blind you from danger, and offers no protection.

Id: [0x001F02A0]
Beast Slayer[&gasp], I'm glad to see you again.

Id: [0x001F0376]
Hmm. There's something small wrapped up in this cloak.

Id: [0x001F038E]
Deimos must be carrying through on his threat.

Id: [0x001F03C2]
Fear not Persians, this will all be over soon!

Id: [0x001F03C4]
Xerxes sent many men, but no warriors!

Id: [0x001F0444]
There's a farmhouse northeast of Tegea where he has a safe house[2155290]. Meet me there before you do anything you'll regret.

Id: [0x001F045B]
This complicates things.

Id: [0x001F045C]
One less Cultist. Seems simple enough.

Id: [0x001F045D]
Lagos was a dear friend once. I should have been there.

Id: [0x001F0688]
What exactly is this place?

Id: [0x001F0689]
Lagos is a very public figure in Arkadia. This is where he handles his more private affairs.

Id: [0x001F068A]
Remind me - why are you covering for the man who wants me and my mother dead?

Id: [0x001F068B]
I've known Lagos a long time. He got supplies through to my lines when my soldiers were starving. For him to act so dishonorably is completely out of character.

Id: [0x001F068C]
I thought Spartans drank blood for breakfast.

Id: [0x001F068D]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]I've seen enough for two lifetimes. Still, I have hope.

Id: [0x001F0693]
When Leonidas died at the Hot Gates, we all came together against a common enemy. Athenians, Spartans, fighting side by side[&breath] -[/&breath]

Id: [0x001F0698]
What is it?

Id: [0x001F0699]
Someone's here.

Id: [0x001F069A]
Good. You have the letter from Lagos?

Id: [0x001F06A1]
<i>Misthios</i>. I need a piece of armor, headgear, and boots from the Daughters of Artemis. Can you help?

Id: [0x001F06A2]
Are these what you're looking for? They don't quite fit me.

Id: [0x001F06A4]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! I'll finally be able to infiltrate the Daughters of Artemis and join my sisters.

Id: [0x001F06A7]
You might want to reconsider. The Daughters of Artemis won't respond well to an intruder.

Id: [0x001F09B8]
Misthios! I need skins from the most fearsome creature in nature. Bears! Can you help me?

Id: [0x001F0A9F]
<i>You</i> don't find Swordfish - Swordfish finds <i>you</i>. Now go before I get my nose cut off.

Id: [0x001F0ABE]
I don't have any.

Id: [0x001F0ABF]
I don't have enough to spare. Maybe later.

Id: [0x001F0AC0]
I can't right now.

Id: [0x001F0AC1]
If I find more, I'll come back.

Id: [0x001F0AC2]
I wish I could.

Id: [0x001F0ACF]
<i>You're </i>his caretaker?

Id: [0x001F0AD0]
Of course! I need to speak with him.

Id: [0x001F0B34]
Breathe, old man -

Id: [0x001F0B35]
Ardos. The boy! Is he safe? Alive?

Id: [0x001F0B37]
I have more questions.

Id: [0x001F0B38]
Anything, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F0B3F]
It's the Eagle Bearer! Kill her!

Id: [0x001F0B4E]
The Scorched Tree. This must be the drop-off point.

Id: [0x001F0B5F]
Ardos says you refuse to speak or talk to him about his father.

Id: [0x001F0B65]
Why would they hurt you?

Id: [0x001F0B66]
When the survivors fled the Minotaur, they left behind a disk - the key to the labyrinth... and I kept it.

Id: [0x001F0B71]
Artemis has laid out eight trials, and you have already started the journey. Hunt down those that remain.

Id: [0x001F0BAA]
I'll return when I have more pelts.

Id: [0x001F0BAB]
What have you...

Id: [0x001F0BAC]
How did you...

Id: [0x001F0BAE]
The Nemean Lion's pelt.

Id: [0x001F0BB2]
This boar was far harder to kill than the Kalydonian one, but I've yet to meet a pig that can't be skewered.

Id: [0x001F0BB4]
The gods chose well when they sent you to me.

Id: [0x001F0BB9]
The bull put up quite a fight, but his pelt is yours.

Id: [0x001F0BBB]
You are remarkable!

Id: [0x001F0BF5]
The Hind of Keryneia's pelt.

Id: [0x001F0BF7]
I remember being awestruck when I caught a glimpse of her through the trees, long ago.

Id: [0x001F0BFA]
It was an honor to hunt such a noble beast. For all the suffering and death I've seen, when you see something as magnificent as this... Words escape me.

Id: [0x001F0BFC]
Artemis was right to bring you to me. A warrior's heart beats within your chest, yet it is tempered by kindness.

Id: [0x001F0C00]
The gods put animals here for us to hunt. Who am I to defy their will?

Id: [0x001F0C02]
As a huntress I take no pleasure in death. We honor our prey, admire their cunning, respect their power - and revere their sacrifice.

Id: [0x001F0C05]
There are more pieces of Theseus's armor, I've only managed to attain two of them.

Id: [0x001F0C0E]
The pelt of the Lykaon Wolf.

Id: [0x001F0C1D]
Be slow to fall into friendship - but once you do, continue firm and constant.

Id: [0x001F0C55]
Questions will have to wait, lamb.

Id: [0x001F0C56]
I want to help.

Id: [0x001F0CB2]
There are details only he can provide. I hope when you meet him you understand.

Id: [0x001F0CB7]
Not Lagos. He was being blackmailed by King Pausanias. He had Lagos's family at knifepoint, and I have proof.

Id: [0x001F0CB8]
Here, the hyena's pelt. Take it. These flea-ridden carrion eaters disgust me!

Id: [0x001F0CBA]
A wolf is not only a vicious predator, but a cunning adversary. Many have fallen before it.

Id: [0x001F0CBB]
King Pausanias?! We must return to Sparta to confront him.

Id: [0x001F0CC0]
Let's get out of here. Can you fight?

Id: [0x001F0CC1]
I'd be <i>happy</i> to.

Id: [0x001F0CC7]
Hey, get me out of here!

Id: [0x001F0CCD]
This... is it? It's just rubble.

Id: [0x001F0CCE]
What were you expecting?

Id: [0x001F0CCF]
I don't know. Something more grand. My parents named me Odessa... I'm Odysseus's namesake. I thought if I came here I might... understand him more.

Id: [0x001F0CD0]
Well, do you?

Id: [0x001F0CD1]
Not at all... Let's just get to the boat. I'll pay you there.

Id: [0x001F0CEF]
We're going to have do some upgrades to my ship if we're sailing into war.

Id: [0x001F0CF0]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001F0CF1]
Well, she's old, and perhaps not in the best condition.

Id: [0x001F0CF2]
You couldn't have said this before we set sail! Where in Poseidon's name are we going to get the supplies?

Id: [0x001F0CF3]
My father taught me that the sea takes... and we must do the same. Fortunately there are plenty of pirate ships in these waters that we can board and take from!

Id: [0x001F0CF4]
What are we waiting for? Let's hunt some pirates.

Id: [0x001F0CFA]
There! See that island. [beat]That is where I saw the beast.

Id: [0x001F0D0C]
We both are.

Id: [0x001F0D0E]
You're right. We've done all we can. It's time to go to Sparta.

Id: [0x001F0D12]
[&ahem]We may have won the wreath, but the kings also wanted us to conquer the Boeotians.

Id: [0x001F0D13]
True, you are needed there before we return.

Id: [0x001F0D16]
Boeotia may be at peace, but the kings also wanted an Olympic victory for Sparta.

Id: [0x001F0D17]
True, you must travel to Elis and win the wreath.

Id: [0x001F0D1A]
No. The kings were clear in their requests. Boeotia must be brought under control, and Sparta must win a wreath at the Olympic Games.

Id: [0x001F0D1B]
There is much left to do, lamb.

Id: [0x001F0D1D]
Very well. I'll take my leave of you, Kassandra. I won't soon forget your good work here.

Id: [0x001F0D20]
Arkadia is safe once more.

Id: [0x001F0D25]
And the bounty is lifted. We are free to travel without fear.

Id: [0x001F0D26]
Then let's continue our journey.

Id: [0x001F0D35]
Yes. It's time we returned.

Id: [0x001F0D3A]
I'm sorry, Brasidas. But when Lagos joined the Cult, he sealed his fate.

Id: [0x001F0D8E]
Should have been there? Brasidas, that man stopped deserving your loyalty the moment he joined the Cult.

Id: [0x001F0DEA]
The Cult has plans for the Greek world. And with my [beat]ways, I know what they will do next and where they plan to do it.

Id: [0x001F0DF1]
The stench of evil is upon her - she worships the Writhing Dread. <i>She must face justice!</i>

Id: [0x001F0DF7]
The<i> Creature</i> took her, but she can still be saved. Help me, please!

Id: [0x001F0DF8]
How dare you bring your curse upon us!

Id: [0x001F0E06]
Good, I'll make it worth your while. Now go quickly - she was last seen east of Pilgrim Hill.

Id: [0x001F0E0D]
Oh, how she twists the truth. She sacrificed her own lover to the Writhing Dread.

Id: [0x001F0E10]
Perhaps you will be of use to me after all.

Id: [0x001F0E11]
I sent one of my handmaidens to spy on some of our own and -

Id: [0x001F0E12]
She hasn't returned.

Id: [0x001F0E13]
Indeed.

Id: [0x001F0E14]
Except I couldn't care less about her... it's the information she uncovered I desire. Retrieve it for me.

Id: [0x001F0E15]
That's it?!

Id: [0x001F0E16]
The rest of the papyrus is stained with blood.

Id: [0x001F0E17]
Cultists on a farm? Something's not right.

Id: [0x001F0E1C]
But I cannot rule out the possibility.

Id: [0x001F0E3B]
I'll see to it, but it's going to cost you.

Id: [0x001F0E3C]
Ha! If you make it back alive, I'll fatten your pockets with drachmae myself.

Id: [0x001F0E3D]
Deal. But first, I have some questions.

Id: [0x001F0E5C]
It'll probably be in a chest in the ruins. Be very careful with it.

Id: [0x001F0E78]
Retrieve our poison vials, they will come in handy when fighting against the Cult.

Id: [0x001F0E88]
It's not safe here - we need to leave the city.

Id: [0x001F0E92]
I thought Bryce's cave sounded familiar - I've been here before! Better find that disk...

Id: [0x001F0E9A]
And don't worry, drachmae will also be given for your services.

Id: [0x001F0EAF]
Let's find out more about what's going on in Arkadia. We should be able to solve this Lagos problem without too many beheadings.

Id: [0x001F0EB2]
I'm sure he has soldiers everywhere in Arkadia... We'll just behead them all.

Id: [0x001F0EB9]
After what happened to the Monger in Korinthia...

Id: [0x001F0EBB]
That crowd wanted blood.

Id: [0x001F0EC6]
Excellent. We need to handle this how you handled the Monger in Korinthia.

Id: [0x001F0EC7]
I'll keep that in mind.

Id: [0x001F0EE2]
I'm not going.

Id: [0x001F0EF6]
That is why I must stay. We must begin again.

Id: [0x001F0EF8]
You saw what happened to Perikles. You want the same to happen to you?

Id: [0x001F0F13]
I do.

Id: [0x001F0F14]
Our job is to deliver this to the Scorched Tree near a golden field. Someone will meet us there and take it to the hideout.

Id: [0x001F0F21]
What's so important about a letter that they'd need us?

Id: [0x001F0F22]
<i>Maláka</i>! Anyone could follow the messenger straight to the family.

Id: [0x001F0F2D]
You should be able to use this to your advantage.

Id: [0x001F0F2F]
It's what I could find about Kleon. Mytilene is just the first of many places that he wants to wipe out.

Id: [0x001F0F30]
With the sway he has over the polis, he'd get the votes for death every time.

Id: [0x001F0F31]
Then it's up to us, right now, to change their minds.

Id: [0x001F0F32]
So you'll join me?

Id: [0x001F0F3F]
An intruder! Don't let them reach the farmhouse!

Id: [0x001F0F45]
Wonder what's down here?

Id: [0x001F0F47]
Talking to the people may not be enough. We need to <i>show</i> them why following Kleon is wrong.

Id: [0x001F0F48]
I'm surprised to hear you suggest such an idea.

Id: [0x001F0F4B]
How am I supposed to help? You're the speaker, not me.

Id: [0x001F0F4C]
That's <i>exactly</i> why you'll be able to help. I need you to act like the people who support Kleon.

Id: [0x001F0F4D]
It won't be easy, but I'll do what I can.

Id: [0x001F0F51]
The pelt from Kallisto the Bear.

Id: [0x001F0F53]
It was, but there are other things on this earth far more beautiful.

Id: [0x001F0F55]
And wild?

Id: [0x001F0F59]
I was too busy trying to survive to wonder at the majesty of nature.

Id: [0x001F0F71]
What of your captain, Euneas?

Id: [0x001F0F72]
...Took him.

Id: [0x001F0F85]
A pity...

Id: [0x001F0FD9]
I found this.

Id: [0x001F0FDC]
He didn't want you to be kept here, but he had no choice.

Id: [0x001F0FDE]
Is it from <i>pater</i>?

Id: [0x001F0FDF]
Are those scary men still with him?

Id: [0x001F0FF1]
Tell me, if you harm someone with a sword, are you not responsible?

Id: [0x001F0FF2]
I am.

Id: [0x001F0FF3]
What if you hire somebody else to harm another? Are you still responsible for that harm?

Id: [0x001F0FF7]
Yes, I'd still be responsible!

Id: [0x001F0FF8]
You are almost <i>too </i>insightful, and you're completely right. If someone should be hurt by any means, and we play any role in that hurt, then we are still responsible.

Id: [0x001F0FFB]
That's ridiculous! I'm not harming the person - someone else is!

Id: [0x001F0FFE]
Then you admit you bear responsibility for that harm, for you have still participated in it, even if indirectly.

Id: [0x001F0FFF]
I suppose I do.

Id: [0x001F1001]
We have agreed that we may harm another, even if not by our own hands.

Id: [0x001F1004]
Would the person not have been safe from harm otherwise?

Id: [0x001F1005]
From me at least, yes.

Id: [0x001F1006]
It is, my child. He wants us to be safe.

Id: [0x001F100A]
Have you heard of the Cult of Kosmos?

Id: [0x001F100D]
They're making your <i>pater</i> do things he doesn't want to do.

Id: [0x001F100E]
I'll find Lagos and release him from these [beat]scary men.

Id: [0x001F1013]
I know the place. We'll go right away. Thank you. We owe you our lives.

Id: [0x001F1017]
Who are you?

Id: [0x001F1018]
The most wanted mercenary in all of Arkadia. Who are you?

Id: [0x001F1019]
Are we going home <i>mater</i>?

Id: [0x001F101A]
Hush, child.

Id: [0x001F101F]
That should be all the pelts.

Id: [0x001F1020]
Yes. But your trial is not yet over.

Id: [0x001F1021]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001F1022]
You have proven yourself a mighty hunter in the eyes of Artemis, but there is one creature you have yet to defeat. This animal is no simple prey. Meet me and my sisters on the cliff overlooking our village for your final test.

Id: [0x001F1023]
Wait! Why the secrecy?

Id: [0x001F1025]
Because it's more fun this way...

Id: [0x001F1038]
You're free, but it's not safe to return to Lagos, yet.

Id: [0x001F1039]
Are those scary men still with <i>pater</i>?

Id: [0x001F1042]
That's right.

Id: [0x001F1043]
So let me ask you another question - who should you trust? The many, or the one who has more expertise?

Id: [0x001F1045]
The majority is always right.

Id: [0x001F1046]
And who is informing the majority?

Id: [0x001F1047]
I suppose we're following the one at the top.

Id: [0x001F104A]
And <i>if</i> you found out the person "at the top" had lied to the people you follow, what would you do?

Id: [0x001F104D]
I follow the one with expertise. Surely they know better than I do.

Id: [0x001F1050]
Then your decision is based only on what another says.

Id: [0x001F1051]
It's all I have to go off of.

Id: [0x001F1052]
And if they lied?

Id: [0x001F1057]
[&scream]Hey![/&scream] [&scream]Stop![/&scream]

Id: [0x001F1061]
So you agree that someone who lies to you is not worthy of leading?

Id: [0x001F1062]
Of course.

Id: [0x001F1063]
[&ah]O[/&ah] Athenians, would you not also agree that you can have responsibility for harming another, even through someone else?

Id: [0x001F1064]
I would!

Id: [0x001F1065]
Of course not!

Id: [0x001F1066]
Above all things, therefore, I beg and implore you hear these words. The one you currently follow <i>is</i> lying for his own gain.

Id: [0x001F1078]
[&ahem]I'm glad Phoibe wasn't here. Hopefully she's safe.

Id: [0x001F1079]
Interesting. It just so happens Lagos wants me dead.

Id: [0x001F107E]
Kleon has lied to you in order to get the votes needed to attack Mytilene. And we have proof that he'll do it again.

Id: [0x001F107F]
Should the ship arrive in Mytilene, the people stand no chance of surviving.

Id: [0x001F1080]
Now that you know the truth, you can take back your decision.

Id: [0x001F1081]
Another vote must be called! The lives of those people are in your hands, too. The ship must be stopped!

Id: [0x001F19FD]
You think you can do better than I have?

Id: [0x001F19FF]
As a matter of fact, I do.

Id: [0x001F1A00]
Come back when you're done. If you make it out of the camp alive.

Id: [0x001F1A02]
Give me that spear.

Id: [0x001F1A07]
A man needs to die.

Id: [0x001F1A0A]
A mercenary's business is rarely their own.

Id: [0x001F1A0B]
Exactly. Of course, she trusts me too.

Id: [0x001F1A1B]
Why am I telling you any of this?!

Id: [0x001F1A1C]
I don't care what you <i>think</i> your relationship with her is, she's just using you. I'm her true love!

Id: [0x001F1A1D]
Right. You keep telling yourself that.

Id: [0x001F1A2A]
Hey! Stop! That's my stuff!

Id: [0x001F1A32]
All right, all right! I'll pay you! Just stop!

Id: [0x001F1A38]
Ah, that hurts! Stop, I'll pay you, stop!

Id: [0x001F1A48]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]Lagos wants nothing of the sort. His new "business partners," though...

Id: [0x001F1A49]
The Cult, you mean.<LF>

Id: [0x001F1A4C]
You say the name Lagos like it should mean something to me.

Id: [0x001F1A4D]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]You're not from Arkadia, are you?

Id: [0x001F1A4E]
Which men?

Id: [0x001F1A50]
I'm not here to hurt you, but I do need answers.

Id: [0x001F1A51]
Those men say <i>pater</i> had better help them, or else...

Id: [0x001F1A52]
Hush.

Id: [0x001F1A55]
He said they were grain dealers - but they dragged us from our beds and brought us here. I haven't seen or heard from Lagos since.

Id: [0x001F1AD8]
Help! Our axe has been stolen!

Id: [0x001F1AE3]
To appease the gods?

Id: [0x001F1AFE]
Isn't the captain a Cultist?

Id: [0x001F1AFF]
What more could you possibly need? Just kill the man.

Id: [0x001F1B10]
Any idea where I can find the captain?

Id: [0x001F1B12]
What Cult?

Id: [0x001F1B13]
That rat should be somewhere around the shipwreck off the north coast of Chytra Atoll.

Id: [0x001F1B14]
He could be a <i>malákas</i> god for all I care. Diona says he wants to destroy her for rejecting him.

Id: [0x001F1B15]
That the only way for us to be together is if I remove him from the picture.

Id: [0x001F1B17]
I led a small party that managed to maroon his ship, but we couldn't finish the job. He and his men will be on their guard.

Id: [0x001F1B1B]
What is the quickest way to Chytra Atoll?

Id: [0x001F1B1C]
Sail south from the southern tip of Kythera until you come across a shipwreck.

Id: [0x001F1B20]
Aren't you here for the same reason? To win her over?

Id: [0x001F1CA4]
She's already mine. And after I slay the captain, which <i>you</i> failed to do, you'll be forgotten.

Id: [0x001F1CA5]
You couldn't have done it without my help! Diona will appreciate all I've done for her!

Id: [0x001F1CA6]
She can't just -

Id: [0x001F1CA7]
Truth be told, her sister is more my type.

Id: [0x001F1CA8]
You better not let Diona hear that. She's a jealous one. She's spent her life living in her sister's shadow.

Id: [0x001F1CA9]
Because all anyone cares about is who's the first born.

Id: [0x001F1CAA]
Why isn't Diona the High Priestess?

Id: [0x001F1CAB]
I'm here to dismantle the Cult of Kosmos. I have no time or interest in the Priestess.

Id: [0x001F1CAC]
You can't fool me with your "Cult" bullshit. No one can resist Diona's charm.

Id: [0x001F1CAD]
<i>And</i> no one would ever call themselves that. <i>Malákas</i> "<i>Cult of Kosmos.</i>"

Id: [0x001F1CAE]
You need to exterminate these pests.

Id: [0x001F1CB3]
The captain? I slayed a very... flamboyantly dressed man earlier by a shipwreck.

Id: [0x001F1CB4]
That sounds like him. All that peacocking, no doubt to catch Diona's eye.

Id: [0x001F1CB5]
Here, take your payment and go. I have no need for you anymore.

Id: [0x001F1CB7]
Hold on. You've been fighting for Diona against the Cult. Tell me everything you know about them.

Id: [0x001F1CBD]
Tell me what you know about the Cult.

Id: [0x001F1CC3]
Go! Get out of here! And don't you go talking to Diona anymore!

Id: [0x001F1CC4]
Or what?

Id: [0x001F1CC5]
Or I'll - Ugh, just go!

Id: [0x001F1CC7]
Whatever.

Id: [0x001F1CC8]
True.

Id: [0x001F1CCA]
I'll be sure she does.

Id: [0x001F1CCC]
His "gift"?

Id: [0x001F1CCD]
Let's just say you'll know it when you see it.

Id: [0x001F1CD1]
That's all I need to know.

Id: [0x001F1CD3]
The captain needs to die! Otherwise Diona will not be safe. Go!

Id: [0x001F1CD5]
Come, my well-muscled friend. There is much to discuss.

Id: [0x001F1CDB]
Lucky for you, I came across some bandits earlier in the ruins to the south. Is this yours?

Id: [0x001F1CDE]
Tell me about Swordfish.

Id: [0x001F1CE0]
By the Fates! It is! Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Now we can prepare for battle against the Cult.

Id: [0x001F1CE3]
He's ruthless. Every business, secret, and drachma in Heraklion flows through him like water through gills. He once beat a man to death with a fish!

Id: [0x001F1CF0]
Go away! Strangers are not welcome here.

Id: [0x001F1CF4]
Please! I'll find a way to pay. Just get him back.

Id: [0x001F1CFF]
I'm going to kill this traitor.

Id: [0x001F1D00]
She's on her way to kill the High Priestess at the altar[2403355] north of the temple. You'll have to hurry.

Id: [0x001F1D01]
The altar[2403355]? Good. Aphrodite will have a sacrifice tonight.

Id: [0x001F1D03]
Why is Diona doing this to her own people?

Id: [0x001F1D04]
Diona hates her sister. She's been second-best all her life.

Id: [0x001F1D06]
So she joined the Cult to take power?

Id: [0x001F1D07]
I never expected her to take it this far.

Id: [0x001F1D09]
I see. I too shall take my own precautions. A visit to see her might be in order. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F1D0A]
Is there something else?

Id: [0x001F1D0B]
About me, maybe?

Id: [0x001F1D18]
What did you have in mind?

Id: [0x001F1D19]
We must force the Paros fleet to engage us and destroy it, but my admiral, Euneas, is missing. His ship was sailing for Paros to engage in peace talks, and he never returned.

Id: [0x001F1D1C]
What do you want to know?

Id: [0x001F1D1D]
Everything you claim to be true. But after this, I kill you. [beat]Why was I abandoned that night on the mountain?

Id: [0x001F1D3A]
You and I both know who feeds the Pythia her words.

Id: [0x001F1D3B]
...I do.

Id: [0x001F1D3C]
A baby with a fate so terrible it was thrown off a cliff. What kind of prophecy would lead to that?

Id: [0x001F1D3E]
A risk.

Id: [0x001F1D3F]
I heard you're unpredictable.

Id: [0x001F1D40]
I call it being decisive.

Id: [0x001F1D41]
You weren't decisive that night. You - "my family" - let me go.

Id: [0x001F1D42]
"Let you go"? You have no idea what happened on that mountain.

Id: [0x001F1D43]
Then tell me.

Id: [0x001F1D44]
Tell me where they are and I'll put an end to this.

Id: [0x001F1D45]
See the pigment of the paint, it's a rare color and I only know one artist who chooses to use it. Last I heard he lives in a cave at the Routsouna waterfall.

Id: [0x001F1D48]
I did everything I could. And I'm doing the same today.

Id: [0x001F1D49]
It's too late. There's nothing you could say to make me feel like family<i>.</i>

Id: [0x001F1D4A]
We did. We're alive.

Id: [0x001F1D4B]
Maybe it serves them right.

Id: [0x001F1D7D]
Right. Though you claim to know much more than me.

Id: [0x001F1D7E]
It's Nikolaos. [beat]He isn't our real father. It was another man - a man like us.

Id: [0x001F1D82]
They knew if they had you, they could use you.

Id: [0x001F1D83]
Because they saw my potential. They were right.

Id: [0x001F1D92]
Wake up, Alexios! The moment you fall, they'll find someone else. Someone more controllable. [beat]Why do you think they want me, too?

Id: [0x001F1D93]
You think they want you? If the Cult wanted you, they would have saved you. If Myrrine wanted you, she'd be here. [beat]Accept it. No one wants you.

Id: [0x001F1D96]
There's no other name for what you did to me. I was left to <i>die.</i>

Id: [0x001F1D97]
We tried to save you.

Id: [0x001F1D98]
They know their strength is in numbers. If I bowed to them like you, they'd have the Greek world at their feet.

Id: [0x001F1D99]
Is that so?

Id: [0x001F1D9B]
I don't bow to them. They bow to <i>me!</i>

Id: [0x001F1D9F]
And what did she find there?

Id: [0x001F1DA0]
She went down the mountain to find you. She <i>had</i> to find you.

Id: [0x001F1DA4]
I'm sorry, Aspasia. About Perikles. And Athens.

Id: [0x001F1DA6]
You have no need to apologize. For anything.

Id: [0x001F1DAC]
I did everything I could to keep people safe.

Id: [0x001F1DAD]
No one thinks otherwise, Kassandra. The Cult of Kosmos simply had a plan we didn't see soon enough. And they struck when the time was right.

Id: [0x001F1DAF]
It feels like... I let everyone down. I didn't get to them quick enough. Didn't make the right decisions.

Id: [0x001F1DB0]
It's not your fault. There's no one to blame but the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x001F1DB2]
I'll make each of them beg for mercy before I kill them.

Id: [0x001F1DB3]
That time will come. For now, let us look to the future. Do you have a heading?

Id: [0x001F1DB4]
I was hoping you would help me with that.

Id: [0x001F1DB5]
Yes, of course. This woman...

Id: [0x001F1DB6]
[&breath]Then we go to Naxos... to see Phoenix.

Id: [0x001F1DBF]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]You're sure?

Id: [0x001F1DC0]
I have lived as an Athenian, and I will die as an Athenian.

Id: [0x001F1DC2]
Then do something for me. Both of you.

Id: [0x001F1DC4]
And I expect to see you both again - alive.

Id: [0x001F1DC7]
If every dissenting voice disappears, the people won't turn against him. <i>They </i>need me here.

Id: [0x001F1DCB]
<i>They</i> were the ones who sent you over that cliff.

Id: [0x001F1DCC]
I gave them victory. They would throw away their champion?<i> Maláka.</i>

Id: [0x001F1DCD]
Is that what she said?

Id: [0x001F1DF2]
She wasn't wrong. There's not an honorable bone in your body.

Id: [0x001F1DF7]
[&breath]We've been over this.

Id: [0x001F2154]
I thought your Cultists told you everything. Sounds like you're on their side, but they're not on yours.

Id: [0x001F215B]
Dutiful as ever.

Id: [0x001F215C]
And he chose that over his family. He was wrong.

Id: [0x001F215E]
If he hadn't, we would've all been disgraced.

Id: [0x001F215F]
And that's worse than where we found ourselves? Pathetic. A "family." Am I supposed to <i>sympathize</i> with you?

Id: [0x001F2161]
The Cult stole you from us. If not for them, <i>none</i> of this would have happened.

Id: [0x001F2162]
Instead, I would've been another Spartan soldier, dead on my shield. The Cult saw greatness in me.

Id: [0x001F2164]
They've warped your mind.

Id: [0x001F2165]
You said it yourself. They wanted me <i>badly</i>. Why do you think that is?

Id: [0x001F2305]
No, they won't stop. I won't let them.

Id: [0x001F2306]
And they won't control me. I'm winning this war for them.

Id: [0x001F2307]
Whatever it takes.

Id: [0x001F2309]
You wouldn't kill if they weren't making you.

Id: [0x001F230A]
Is it so different from the killing you do, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001F230C]
If you're so wise, what do you think they're doing with my power?

Id: [0x001F230F]
I made <i>myself</i>.

Id: [0x001F2310]
Into what? This is what you wanted to be?

Id: [0x001F2311]
I am a <i>god.</i> The Cult worships me.

Id: [0x001F2358]
Then explain why I'm still here.

Id: [0x001F2359]
They got to you young. They built you to their benefit.

Id: [0x001F2379]
And they got one of us.

Id: [0x001F25B1]
Deimos. We've been searching for you.

Id: [0x001F25B3]
Leave. Now. This was not your action to take, boy.

Id: [0x001F262A]
I am <i>not</i> your puppet!

Id: [0x001F262C]
And you are not my master.

Id: [0x001F262D]
Of course, champion. An indiscretion I won't repeat.

Id: [0x001F2631]
Do whatever you want with her.

Id: [0x001F2632]
I intend to. Now go.

Id: [0x001F269D]
Keep in mind you put yourself in the cell.

Id: [0x001F26BE]
[&breath]At least you tried.

Id: [0x001F26BF]
Surely it's the thought that counts! [beat]Thank the gods you're alive, Kassandra.

Id: [0x001F26C0]
If those guards aren't the last, I say we need to leave, and do so quickly.

Id: [0x001F26C1]
Wait - we need to talk about Kleon.

Id: [0x001F26C2]
Come, Barnabas! Kassandra, meet us at Perikles's Residence. There, we'll discuss all we know.

Id: [0x001F2752]
I don't recall doing that.

Id: [0x001F2753]
You have to understand - this is all for Athens, Kassandra. Perikles would've impoverished the entire city. The people were living in squalor!

Id: [0x001F2754]
So you had him murdered.

Id: [0x001F2755]
You can't find the perfect yolk without breaking some of the quail's eggs. He wasn't right for us.

Id: [0x001F2797]
This job will be dangerous and could get us both killed.

Id: [0x001F279C]
All my jobs are dangerous.

Id: [0x001F27AA]
A scrap of clothing - my guess Ligeia's. Whatever tore it from her was savage...

Id: [0x001F27BD]
At least you look better than that other idiot at the harbor.

Id: [0x001F27CC]
I'll get you the information your handmaiden found.

Id: [0x001F27CD]
Good, I'll make it worth your while. Now go quickly, she was last seen east of Pilgrim Hill.

Id: [0x001F27D1]
Tell me how you were able to defeat the Creature.

Id: [0x001F27D2]
Where should I start looking for her?

Id: [0x001F27D3]
I sent her to the outskirts of Kythera.

Id: [0x001F27D4]
Hm... I recall there being a farm in that area. She might've taken refuge there.

Id: [0x001F27D5]
That's where I'll start then.

Id: [0x001F27D7]
Your dislike for your sister is obvious. What happened between you two?

Id: [0x001F27D8]
I'm the first born, and with that comes certain privileges and responsibilities. My sister is a vindictive, jealous creature.

Id: [0x001F27D9]
She undermines my authority constantly. Clearly, she thinks she'd make the better High Priestess.

Id: [0x001F27DA]
Why go after the Creature in the first place?

Id: [0x001F27DB]
We were hired to steal an ancient item from within its lair by masked soldiers.

Id: [0x001F27E5]
I see.

Id: [0x001F27F5]
But she is my sister. And I do love her.

Id: [0x001F27F6]
I just wish she wasn't a jealous little fool.

Id: [0x001F27F8]
I found this note earlier on the body of a priestess at a farm. She was slain by Cultists before I found her.

Id: [0x001F27F9]
What? Read it to me, quickly!

Id: [0x001F27FA]
It says, "Don't trust the Fates." The rest of the papyrus is stained with blood.

Id: [0x001F27FB]
<i>Misthios</i>, you must kill her before she lets the Cult take over Kythera! It pains me, but it must be done.

Id: [0x001F27FC]
You wouldn't feel a thing, you monster - I'm not sure you ever have.

Id: [0x001F27FF]
She has the High Priestess. By the Altar of Aphrodite... Follow the road ahead... And hurry -

Id: [0x001F2801]
Free the remaining prisoners before coming back to me.

Id: [0x001F2802]
J-Just forget about me.

Id: [0x001F2804]
Excellent.

Id: [0x001F2807]
The Cult of Kosmos have much to answer for. And they will answer to me.

Id: [0x001F280E]
Tell me more about the rest of your requests.

Id: [0x001F2812]
Enough idle chatter. Tell me what you know about the Cult.

Id: [0x001F2813]
And take a good <i>long</i> look at your beautiful self.

Id: [0x001F2814]
If you insist.

Id: [0x001F2817]
Excuse me?

Id: [0x001F2824]
She would be looking to avoid busy areas like the military camp - wait.

Id: [0x001F2825]
Did you have something to do with my prisoners being broken out of jail at the military camp?

Id: [0x001F283D]
Yes, that was my doing.

Id: [0x001F283F]
The harbor master said the High Priestess locks up innocent people and executes them.

Id: [0x001F2840]
I could not stand idly by.

Id: [0x001F2842]
I wasn't going to execute them! Torture them, maybe. But all stand trial here in Kythera. That liar!

Id: [0x001F2844]
The harbor master strikes out at the temple when my sister scorns him. But this time, he's gone too far.

Id: [0x001F2845]
I'll overlook your involvement in this. Just make sure you get me that information while I deal with him.

Id: [0x001F2848]
The harbor master did it. I tried to stop him but I was too late.

Id: [0x001F2849]
Again with that worm! This is all Diona's fault.

Id: [0x001F284B]
She has him wrapped around her finger. Every once in a while, she'll break his heart and he'll do something stupid.

Id: [0x001F2852]
Brave misthios! I'm in need of a brave misthios!

Id: [0x001F2857]
You did well trying to stop him. Now, get me my information while I deal with the harbor master.

Id: [0x001F285A]
These bears. Where can I find them?

Id: [0x001F2865]
Where did you say to look again?

Id: [0x001F2866]
Try the farm outside of the city. She might be hiding out there.

Id: [0x001F2869]
I have the feeling you could talk about bears all day. I'll return when I have the skins.

Id: [0x001F286A]
The gods?

Id: [0x001F2874]
So you're not the god of "getting to the point?"

Id: [0x001F2877]
And you're here. In the gutter. [beat]I heard shouting.

Id: [0x001F2974]
Killing your adversaries proves what kind of leader you are.

Id: [0x001F2975]
Oh, I'm just getting started. [beat]If only you'd be around to watch.

Id: [0x001F2977]
Then you'll do things differently than Perikles.

Id: [0x001F2978]
Friends flank my every side. The people trust in me. They know my every decree and law will be to their benefit. And they will <i>delight </i>in what I have planned.

Id: [0x001F297A]
Come into the cell. You're here to kill me, aren't you? Let's see what happens.

Id: [0x001F297B]
Fortunately for me, there are other fires I need to extinguish. I've heard word of revolt.

Id: [0x001F297D]
Already? That was fast.

Id: [0x001F297E]
I have a plan - they can't revolt if they're dead.

Id: [0x001F297F]
I don't know how you can take on a band of rebels if you refuse to fight this one.

Id: [0x001F2980]
The act itself is out of my hands - the vote has been cast! What did I tell you? The people have given me their blessing. I use<i> their </i>power.

Id: [0x001F2981]
That's not democracy.

Id: [0x001F2982]
I'm not alone in this! The people of Athens have spoken without me lifting a finger. <i>That</i> is how you treat rebellion.

Id: [0x001F2983]
The Cult <i>wins</i>, Kassandra. [beat]Now, I have to see about the boat heading to Mytilene. Its people are in for a rude awakening.

Id: [0x001F2987]
Let me go! [Growls]Let me go!

Id: [0x001F298E]
[Howl]Let me out!

Id: [0x001F2995]
[Howls]You there! Artemis sent you to save me!

Id: [0x001F299C]
Blessings to you, two-legs. I am Zoe, Daughter of Artemis. Thanks for freeing me from the stone-dwellers earlier.

Id: [0x001F29B1]
My four-legged brothers and sisters, the woodland creatures. We'll have our revenge on the stone-dwellers, who steal from our island.

Id: [0x001F29CF]
Sokrates is onto that maláka. We know what he's doing.

Id: [0x001F29D4]
Many thanks, two-legs! It's not safe to speak here though... Meet me behind the temple in Chios city.

Id: [0x001F29DB]
Two-legs? As opposed to what?

Id: [0x001F29DD]
Our four-legged brothers and sisters, of course. We are all equal - our souls are the same.

Id: [0x001F29DE]
I haven't put much thought into that.

Id: [0x001F29DF]
You should. We both have animal instincts.

Id: [0x001F29E0]
I learn new things every day.

Id: [0x001F29E1]
Who are these people you call "stone-dwellers"?

Id: [0x001F29E2]
They came from the west years ago, and cut down our forests and dug up our earth to build their stone buildings.

Id: [0x001F29E9]
You seemed to be in a tight spot - looked like you could use a hand.

Id: [0x001F29EB]
I was outnumbered. No room to run. Now that I'm free, I can plan our revenge against the stone-dwellers.

Id: [0x001F29ED]
Our revenge? Who else is involved?

Id: [0x001F29EE]
The <i>stone-dwellers</i> have many weapons and defenses. They won't be easy targets.

Id: [0x001F29EF]
That's why I need my furry friends. Will you free them like you freed me? In return for your help, I'll give you my finest bow.

Id: [0x001F2A44]
I've done all I can.

Id: [0x001F2A47]
Animals shouldn't be caged.

Id: [0x001F2A48]
I knew we were kindred spirits. My four-legged brethren are held in two camps in the deforested area. Release them all so they may run free once again.

Id: [0x001F2A4B]
Consider it done.

Id: [0x001F2A4D]
Be brief! Her equipment, Barnabas.

Id: [0x001F2A9E]
Fine. But should you wish to serve justice, come back.

Id: [0x001F2AAC]
It will be more difficult for me now that Anaxagoras must leave Athens. We were quite close, although he and Perikles were much closer. It's strange Perikles wasn't here today to defend him.

Id: [0x001F2AAD]
Who are you?

Id: [0x001F2AAE]
Ask anyone and they'll tell you Sokrates, but a name gives you nothing. Our actions determine who we are, and every action has its pleasures and its price. With that said, then, who do you claim to be?

Id: [0x001F2ABD]
The leader of Lesbos is the problem. You're the solution.

Id: [0x001F2B2D]
I thought you weren't interested in Chios's problems. Have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x001F2B3B]
It's nothing.

Id: [0x001F2B43]
My name is Kassandra.

Id: [0x001F2B44]
And still, I don't feel I know you. Perhaps I can find out who you are a different way.

Id: [0x001F2B45]
I know the price of actions. I have to as a mercenary.

Id: [0x001F2B46]
That simple piece of information tells me more about you than your name ever could. Explaining oneself must be carefully done.

Id: [0x001F2B47]
Explaining myself would take more time than I have.

Id: [0x001F2B4C]
We must learn to see the beauty in all things.

Id: [0x001F2B51]
I've done what you've asked. Your "family" is free.

Id: [0x001F2B52]
Many thanks to you, warrior of Artemis! You're worthy of this bow. May the whole world know of your deeds!

Id: [0x001F2B53]
I'll make the most of it.

Id: [0x001F2B55]
You said you were close...

Id: [0x001F2B56]
He was like a mentor to me. Many of my best thoughts came to fruition through our conversations.

Id: [0x001F2B57]
Would Perikles normally defend someone?

Id: [0x001F2B6A]
Two-legs! Please help my family. They've been trapped by the stone-dwellers.

Id: [0x001F2B6E]
Release my four-legged brethren from their cages.

Id: [0x001F2B71]
You want to know me?

Id: [0x001F2B72]
Then let us focus on a single, recent event. Tell me, as a mercenary, is there anything you wouldn't do?

Id: [0x001F2C0F]
"Don't trust the Fates?" This is the note I gave the High Priestess -

Id: [0x001F2C11]
You <i>snake</i>.

Id: [0x001F2C12]
By the Fates! What have you done, my beautiful stranger?[&laughs]

Id: [0x001F2C14]
You slayed Kythera's <i>dear</i> High Priestess? They're going to be <i>very</i> cross with you.

Id: [0x001F3FA2]
And now I'm going to kill her sister.

Id: [0x001F3FA3]
I won't go down as easy.

Id: [0x001F3FA6]
I <i>bite</i>, remember?

Id: [0x001F3FA8]
I <i>always </i>bite!

Id: [0x001F3FA9]
Your Cult leader has been sniffed out, High Priestess.

Id: [0x001F3FAA]
My own <i>sister.</i>

Id: [0x001F3FB0]
Big. Big and angry.

Id: [0x001F3FB1]
Yes, inspect my flesh closely mortal! Before you stands Empedokles - A true god!

Id: [0x001F3FB8]
Siblings...

Id: [0x001F3FB9]
I hated her.

Id: [0x001F3FBA]
But, I loved her too.

Id: [0x001F3FBB]
I know how that feels.

Id: [0x001F3FBE]
Her true nature was clear.

Id: [0x001F3FC1]
I loved her despite all she's done over the years.

Id: [0x001F3FC2]
That love blinded me.

Id: [0x001F3FC3]
It did.

Id: [0x001F3FC9]
You've secured Kythera for me, <i>misthios</i>. Now, about the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x001F3FD0]
You don't bite hard enough, priestess.

Id: [0x001F3FDA]
Someone must put a stop to this madness. Root out the evil at its core, misthios.

Id: [0x001F3FE2]
The Cult of Kosmos is in Pephka, <i>misthios</i>. Seek out Melite and destroy him.

Id: [0x001F3FE6]
We should leave! Diona's guards might come after us.

Id: [0x001F3FF3]
He has forsaken us. We can't go back to him.

Id: [0x001F3FF4]
Don't be afraid. I'm going to take care of the men who threatened your <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x001F3FF7]
Is <i>pater</i> still with those scary men?

Id: [0x001F3FFB]
So the Cult was holding Lagos's family hostage... No wonder he was acting strange.

Id: [0x001F3FFC]
I should go tell Brasidas.<LF>

Id: [0x001F406D]
An animal did this.

Id: [0x001F4075]
I hope the beasts I freed didn't do this...

Id: [0x001F4079]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x001F407A]
My workers are sick! At this rate, I won't be able to feed my own family, never mind theirs.

Id: [0x001F407B]
The good news is this isn't the work of the gods, but a sickness of the body - the throat in particular. I could treat the workers... if I had my medical supplies.

Id: [0x001F4081]
What are we going to do...

Id: [0x001F4082]
Don't worry, it's curable.

Id: [0x001F4084]
<i>Misthios</i>... Would you get them for me?

Id: [0x001F408F]
This cave looks like a thief's hideout...

Id: [0x001F412C]
This was a very busy thief.

Id: [0x001F4159]
This grass is matted down. Someone walked on it going west.

Id: [0x001F416A]
These branches are damaged. I'm getting closer.

Id: [0x001F416C]
That's a lot of chopped trees... The lumber would be a fine addition to any ship.

Id: [0x001F416F]
Everyone knows the finest lumber comes from Chios.

Id: [0x001F4174]
How is using our lumber to strengthen the fleets of other nations helping? No! He has his own interests at heart, not the interests of Lesbos.

Id: [0x001F4176]
Leaders have a duty to serve their people and their land.

Id: [0x001F417C]
Agreed. This leader is guided by self-interest and greed, pure and simple.

Id: [0x001F4188]
I can help take care of the "problem."

Id: [0x001F418D]
I can't help you right now.

Id: [0x001F418E]
I understand. The plight of Chios belongs to its people alone.

Id: [0x001F4190]
I'll find your supplies.

Id: [0x001F4192]
Excellent. My tools are in Ancient Pearl, and the drugs are in Lover's Bay.

Id: [0x001F4193]
I'm busy. You'll have to find someone else.

Id: [0x001F4195]
My grapes will wither on the vine without my workers!

Id: [0x001F41A7]
<i>Misthios</i>, you're back!

Id: [0x001F41A8]
Will you find my supplies so I can heal these workers?

Id: [0x001F41B9]
Ancient Pearl is pretty big. Where exactly did you leave your tools?

Id: [0x001F41BA]
In the clinic at Vrisa Fort.

Id: [0x001F41BC]
Where exactly in Lover's Bay should I look?

Id: [0x001F41BD]
At the Leader House in Mytilene, northeast of the temple.

Id: [0x001F41BE]
I'll come back with your supplies.

Id: [0x001F41BF]
The faster you do, the sooner I can help the workers.

Id: [0x001F41C1]
The physician's tools.

Id: [0x001F41C6]
These must be the drugs the physician wanted.

Id: [0x001F41CD]
Do you need something else?

Id: [0x001F41D1]
I found your supplies.

Id: [0x001F41D4]
Without grapes, there's no work. By healing the workers, you've saved my farm! Take this.

Id: [0x001F41D7]
Thank you. These are specialized items - I couldn't have replaced them in time.

Id: [0x001F41D8]
My grapes are saved!

Id: [0x001F42CC]
Thank the gods, a <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F42D5]
I wish I'd had the chance to see this creature in the wild. It must have been stunning.

Id: [0x001F42D9]
If not, then where would the challenge be in pursuing it?

Id: [0x001F42E5]
Magnificent, as is its hunter.

Id: [0x001F42ED]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x001F42EE]
My husband's been murdered, and my two sons taken! Bandits have taken over our farm in the Forest of Tears, and I fear they'll turn them into slaves.

Id: [0x001F42F0]
Please, you have to rescue my family.

Id: [0x001F42F2]
Back already... Did you rescue my sons from the bandits and save our farm?

Id: [0x001F42F3]
I have some questions first.

Id: [0x001F42F5]
I will help, but you should think twice before making deals with bandits in future.

Id: [0x001F42F7]
I'm busy. You'll have to live with your choice.

Id: [0x001F42F8]
All we ever wanted was to work the earth. We're honest people. Why would the gods punish honest people?

Id: [0x001F42FA]
Praise Athena! I will. Thank you.

Id: [0x001F42FB]
I'll go to your farm and see what I can do.

Id: [0x001F42FD]
Where can I find your farm?

Id: [0x001F42FE]
Our Mastic Farm is to the south of town, in the Forest of Tears.

Id: [0x001F42FF]
Where would the bandits have taken your boys?

Id: [0x001F4300]
When the bandits freed me to collect their drachmae, my sons were locked up on our farm[2392900]. One's in the house, and the other's in a supply hut out back.

Id: [0x001F4301]
These bandits. What kind of deal did you make with them?

Id: [0x001F4302]
They would find us a farm to work on, and we'd share the profits with them. But then we found out the farm wasn't abandoned, and the bandits had killed the previous owners.

Id: [0x001F4303]
Please hurry! Deal with the bandits and save my boys before it's too late!

Id: [0x001F431C]
Help! My sons - they're in danger.

Id: [0x001F4320]
Athena awaits you!

Id: [0x001F4322]
Ares demands your audience!

Id: [0x001F4323]
I last saw him many years ago, diving for treasure around Fisherman's Beacon. I haven't seen him since.

Id: [0x001F4326]
I've <i>also</i> killed this Creature<i>.</i>

Id: [0x001F4328]
We're born into darkness and rise up to the greatest peaks... before descending into darkness once more.

Id: [0x001F4333]
You there! <i>Misthios</i>!

Id: [0x001F4337]
Impossible!

Id: [0x001F4338]
Perseus killed the Creature, you killed the Creature, I killed the Creature. Maybe they were all real.

Id: [0x001F4339]
If that's true, then my friends... their sacrifice was for naught. What good then is this spear?

Id: [0x001F433D]
Finally brave enough to challenge me?

Id: [0x001F4344]
What's on your mind, old man?

Id: [0x001F4345]
I'm dying, <i>misthios</i>. I can feel it in my bones. But first, there's something I need to do. Will you help an old man fulfill his dying wish?

Id: [0x001F4384]
Try someone else.

Id: [0x001F4385]
I'm sorry to hear that.

Id: [0x001F438A]
I won't deny an old man his final wish. What is it?

Id: [0x001F438B]
I always promised my wife I'd take her to see the red flowers on the summit of the mountain[2378770] in Zeus's Playground. It's a beautiful place - great view.

Id: [0x001F438F]
I can't wait to see my wife again, but I'm going to need those red flowers.

Id: [0x001F4391]
Have you come back to help me find the flowers?

Id: [0x001F4412]
The flowers... I should hurry back to the old man near Gortyn.

Id: [0x001F4416]
Hades claims another.

Id: [0x001F442E]
Now kneel.

Yes. He asked me to fetch them.

Id: [0x001F4A28]
Here.

Id: [0x001F4A2A]
Your father promised me his drachmae.<LF>

Id: [0x001F4A36]
Before the war can truly begin, we'll need your help weakening Gortyn. Destroy their supplies, steal their valuables... and kill that <i>malákas</i> visiting<i> </i>herald.

Id: [0x001F4A41]
Drachmae for the person who escorts my ship back safely!

Id: [0x001F4A51]
You've ruined everything! The people will think I murdered him, and the council will <i>never</i> elect me now. You will pay for this error, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F4A58]
After war, the boule council chooses a new leader.

Id: [0x001F4A5D]
Save my ship from the pirates, and I'll make it worth your while.

Id: [0x001F4A61]
We need to get back to Skandeia before the pirates return!

Id: [0x001F4A75]
You there! Misthios! Yes, you!

Id: [0x001F4A82]
I have quite the deal to offer you, if you're open to a business partnership?

Id: [0x001F4A87]
Get my goods and my ship back to me, and I'll make you the richest mercenary in Kythera.

Id: [0x001F4A92]
I'm a <i>misthios</i>, I don't share glory.

Id: [0x001F4AA6]
If you want a lynx's fang, I'll need a heading.

Id: [0x001F4AA7]
Of course! Lynxes can be found north of the Lost Minoan Shrine in Zeus's Playground. And be careful, they're feisty.

Id: [0x001F4AA8]
That's all I need to know. I'll return your ship.

Id: [0x001F4AAA]
My goods are <i>extremely</i> valuable. Please don't let the pirates get them.

Id: [0x001F4AAC]
Sounds like you could use a misthios.

Id: [0x001F4AAD]
Yes! Pirates attacked my ship as I returned from the mainland.

Id: [0x001F4AAE]
I got away, but my crew was forced to beach on an island east of Kythera.

Id: [0x001F4AAF]
You abandoned your crew to save your own skin?

Id: [0x001F4AB0]
And that someone just <i>had </i>to be you...

Id: [0x001F4AB1]
I had no choice. Someone had to get help!

Id: [0x001F4AB2]
I craft bows from rare, exotic items. I've been commissioned to make one using only the finest quality fangs! One from a lynx, one from a lioness, and one from a shark. I could make one for you, too, if you'll help.

Id: [0x001F4AB3]
I'll fetch the fangs for you, if you'll tell me where to find them. [beat]Though sharks have teeth, not fangs -

Id: [0x001F4AB6]
A lioness? In <i>Krete?!</i>

Id: [0x001F4AB7]
As luck would have it, one is being transported for a rich man on the road from Phaistos Village to Gortyn City.

Id: [0x001F4ABE]
Someone had to get help. You did the right thing.

Id: [0x001F4ABF]
And I would do it again! My goods are worth more than you can imagine, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F4AC2]
Look, my ship sits on an island begging to be pillaged by pirates.

Id: [0x001F4AC3]
My request is simple - escort it back with my goods intact.

Id: [0x001F4ACA]
It's mine! All mine I say!

Id: [0x001F4ACB]
Leave! Get out!

Id: [0x001F4ACE]
I can escort your ship.

Id: [0x001F4AD6]
Settle down, old man.

Id: [0x001F4AD8]
Settle down? I'll settle down when you leave.<LF>

Id: [0x001F4ADD]
I'm not interested in your... <i>hoard</i>.

Id: [0x001F4ADE]
Liar! That's what the others said!

Id: [0x001F4AE3]
I have better things to do.

Id: [0x001F4AE4]
Unless you change your mind, stay out of my sight.

Id: [0x001F4AE8]
You said the ship is east of Kythera. Where exactly?

Id: [0x001F4AEC]
It's beached on Diakofti Island, off the eastern coast.

Id: [0x001F4AED]
I warned you!

Id: [0x001F4AEE]
What treasures do you have on the ship?

Id: [0x001F4AF1]
Your hoard is safe. I have no intention of stealing it.

Id: [0x001F4AF2]
You're damn right it's safe. I'll kill anyone who tries to steal it. Now, leave my cave or else.

Id: [0x001F4AF5]
I'm a Murex trader, and the snail guts they use to make the dye are worth a fortune.

Id: [0x001F4AF9]
Gold, oysters - whatever these purple bastards on Kythera will trade for.

Id: [0x001F4AFA]
Why are you still here? You need to escort my ship back to the harbor.

Id: [0x001F4AFF]
My treasure! Mine!

Id: [0x001F4B0A]
If my crew is to survive this trip, we will need your help, <i>misthios</i>. Ready to go?

Id: [0x001F4B0E]
Oh, a real adventurer! Please, help!

Id: [0x001F4B12]
Please, <i>misthios</i>! It's my idiot husband!

Id: [0x001F4B15]
You don't look like a pirate - you look even more dangerous. What do you want?

Id: [0x001F4B1C]
All the glory will be yours, I assure you! I only mean to hire you for a job.

Id: [0x001F4B1F]
I'm your escort. A merchant in Skandeia Harbor sent me to make sure no pirates take this ship.

Id: [0x001F4B20]
Says there's no time to waste.

Id: [0x001F4B24]
If you're ready, we must leave for Skandeia Harbor now.

Id: [0x001F4B29]
No, I'm not ready yet.

Id: [0x001F4B2B]
Please hurry. We can't stay here much longer.

Id: [0x001F4B31]
That... is a lot of blood!

Id: [0x001F4B35]
Help! I can hear you!

Id: [0x001F4B39]
Please, I - there's so much blood, help!

Id: [0x001F4B40]
Lynx don't prowl for nothing... Must be something in that cave.

Id: [0x001F4B43]
What exactly did you have in mind?

Id: [0x001F4B44]
Let's do it. I'll come back with my ship.

Id: [0x001F4B45]
We need to get there in one piece.

Id: [0x001F4B46]
Where you make drachmae, and I make drachmae? That kind of partnership?

Id: [0x001F4B47]
Exactly! Equal work, equal pay.

Id: [0x001F4B49]
Now, there were questions?

Id: [0x001F4B53]
You look like you could use a hand.

Id: [0x001F4B54]
Such gestures are rarely without motive.

Id: [0x001F4B55]
But I'm in no position to reject a helping hand.

Id: [0x001F4B5D]
What's wrong with him?

Id: [0x001F4B5E]
He's an idiot.

Id: [0x001F4B5F]
That's one problem I can't solve.

Id: [0x001F4B60]
He's a fisherman who thought he could make better drachmae hunting lynx - spent everything we had on a bow! I haven't seen him in three days.<i> Please, misthios,</i> will you find my idiot?

Id: [0x001F4B64]
<i>Misthios</i>! My husband!

Id: [0x001F4B6B]
Not only will I find your idiot, I'll bring him home.

Id: [0x001F4B71]
We need you to stave off any pirates that attack as we make our way south.

Id: [0x001F4B73]
Have you come back to help me find the fangs of a lynx, a lioness, and a shark? I keep my promises, and I'll make you a one-of-a-kind bow for your troubles!

Id: [0x001F4B76]
Idiots aren't a high priority for me.

Id: [0x001F4B78]
Thank you! He was last seen west of Skandeia Harbor. Please hurry.

Id: [0x001F4B79]
Have you forgotten where to look for the animals and their sharp, shiny fangs?

Id: [0x001F4B87]
Looks like some pirates paid you a visit.

Id: [0x001F4B88]
They attacked us on our way to Skandeia Harbor.

Id: [0x001F4B89]
We managed to fend them off, but if they come back...

Id: [0x001F4B8A]
Merchant ships aren't built for battle.

Id: [0x001F4B8D]
My husband's been missing for days! Please <i>misthios</i>, find my idiot.

Id: [0x001F4B96]
So he's an idiot - but is he a good huntsman?

Id: [0x001F4B97]
He struggled with fish, <i>misthios</i>. <i>Tiny, toothless fish.</i> And now the fool is <i>hunting lynx.</i>

Id: [0x001F4C08]
How much is your husband worth to you?

Id: [0x001F4C09]
You can keep his bow. It was the talk of the agora before he bought it.

Id: [0x001F4C0E]
He's been gone a while. I should get going.

Id: [0x001F4C0F]
I've found everything you need.

Id: [0x001F4C10]
And as your reward, my finest creation - the fang bow! It's yours!

Id: [0x001F4C14]
How?

Id: [0x001F4C16]
Because <i>you're</i> not an idiot.

Id: [0x001F4C18]
You'll find him. I know it.

Id: [0x001F4C1C]
That must be the cart that was transporting the lioness.

Id: [0x001F4C21]
The driver must've lost control, and the lioness's cage broke open.

Id: [0x001F4C2B]
Hmm. A note. The driver was to deliver the lioness to the leader of Gortyn.

Id: [0x001F4C2F]
You look like someone willing to pay for help.

Id: [0x001F4C30]
Ah. A <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F4C31]
That's right.

Id: [0x001F4C38]
I knew you weren't a lynx. Heard your footsteps. Only two. Lynx have four.

Id: [0x001F4C3C]
You're seriously wounded.

Id: [0x001F4C3D]
These lynx - uh, they're a bit tougher than the sea bass I usually catch. Could you help a fellow hunter home to his wife?

Id: [0x001F4C3E]
I'll return when I have all the fangs.

Id: [0x001F4C3F]
Perhaps you've heard of "the ocean"?

Id: [0x001F4C49]
You're a hunter. You'll sort yourself out.

Id: [0x001F4C50]
I've got better things to do than chase around animals.

Id: [0x001F4C51]
If you change your mind, I'll be here.

Id: [0x001F4C53]
Fellow hunter... Help me back to my wife.

Id: [0x001F4C55]
I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x001F4C58]
Thank the gods! She's in Skandeia Harbor.

Id: [0x001F4C7A]
They're closing in on us!

Id: [0x001F4C7C]
<i>Misthios</i>! My ship can't take much more!

Id: [0x001F4C7E]
Get the pirates!

Id: [0x001F4C80]
You traitor! You won't get away with this.

Id: [0x001F4C82]
Here they come! Sink them, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x001F4C85]
We did it! Come here, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F4C90]
If I get you home safe, what's my reward?

Id: [0x001F4C91]
My bow. It's my pride and joy - sold almost everything I owned to buy it.

Id: [0x001F4C92]
You said you usually catch sea bass - what made you think you could take on a lynx?

Id: [0x001F4C93]
Never seen a Kytherian sea bass, have you? Even a lynx wouldn't touch 'em!

Id: [0x001F4C95]
You've lost a lot of blood. If you're going to make it home, we'll need to move now.

Id: [0x001F4C9B]
Tell me about your wife.

Id: [0x001F4C9C]
<i>She's</i> the real lynx!

Id: [0x001F4CA0]
Please don't tell her I said that.

Id: [0x001F4CA2]
Please <i>misthios</i>, I need to get home to my wife.

Id: [0x001F4CAA]
Ow, ow, ow!

Id: [0x001F4CB0]
You did good getting us back safely, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F4CBB]
Ugh!

Id: [0x001F4CBF]
Happy thoughts...

Id: [0x001F4CC3]
How much blood can a man lose?

Id: [0x001F4CCB]
I'm getting tired.

Id: [0x001F4CD2]
Here, take this. I'll just tell my boss the pirates got it.

Id: [0x001F4CD4]
Thanks.

Id: [0x001F4CD8]
What happened?!

Id: [0x001F4CDE]
Look for my boss. He's probably drunk somewhere.

Id: [0x001F4CE2]
Pirates are no match for me.

Id: [0x001F4CE3]
It's not everyday I meet a kind soul like yourself.

Id: [0x001F4CE7]
For your payment, you'll have to speak to my boss, the murex trader.

Id: [0x001F4CEB]
I last saw him drinking near the agora. I'll pay him a visit and collect my drachmae.

Id: [0x001F4CEC]
If it's a drink that gives him away, he'll be easy to spot. I'll check the agora first.

Id: [0x001F4CEE]
I found him in a cave, surrounded by lynx. He'd killed a few, but was too far gone to bring home.

Id: [0x001F4CEF]
He's probably drinking somewhere, dressed in gaudy purple.

Id: [0x001F4CF8]
So my husband was alive when you found him?

Id: [0x001F4CF9]
He was badly wounded -

Id: [0x001F4CFA]
But breathing? You - you could have helped him!

Id: [0x001F4CFB]
I did all I could -

Id: [0x001F4D00]
I found him in a cave not far from here. He was wounded, but alive.

Id: [0x001F4D01]
I stopped the bleeding and offered to bring him home, but he didn't want to come back.

Id: [0x001F4D02]
Liar! How - you killed him! I'll send every mercenary in the Greek world after you!

Id: [0x001F4D03]
I - what?

Id: [0x001F4D05]
I know you didn't do this for the drachmae, but tell him I sent you to collect payment... and wring his fat pockets <i>dry</i>.

Id: [0x001F4D06]
If you say so.

Id: [0x001F4D09]
And you must be his wife.

Id: [0x001F4D0B]
The wife of an idiot, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x001F4D0E]
He's not a nice man. Good luck getting your drachmae from him.

Id: [0x001F4D0F]
Don't worry. I'll make sure he pays.

Id: [0x001F4D13]
So. Are we having lynx for dinner?

Id: [0x001F4D14]
Enough about the lynx.

Id: [0x001F4D17]
Missed your idiot?

Id: [0x001F4D18]
My love, you're alive!

Id: [0x001F4D1F]
You are the strangest people I've ever met.

Id: [0x001F4D21]
Love <i>is</i> strange, <i>misthios</i>. Best to embrace it.

Id: [0x001F4D26]
He said you were... "the real lynx."

Id: [0x001F4D2E]
Wonderful. I'll leave you to, ah -

Id: [0x001F4D31]
I'm happy to see you reunited.

Id: [0x001F4D3F]
What d'you want?

Id: [0x001F4D40]
I take it you're the murex trader.

Id: [0x001F4D41]
Oh, a philosopher... What gave it away? The purple brilliance?

Id: [0x001F4D56]
Look, murex man. I escorted your ship back safely.

Id: [0x001F4D57]
So, <i>pay up </i>before I drown you in one of your dye vats.

Id: [0x001F4D5A]
By the Gods, you're crazy! Take it. My goods better be at the docks like you said.

Id: [0x001F4D62]
It's done. Your ship and your goods have made it safely back to Skandeia Harbor. Now pay up.

Id: [0x001F4D63]
Took you long enough, misthios.

Id: [0x001F4D69]
You're drunk. So before you say anything stupid again, <i>pay me.</i>

Id: [0x001F4D6A]
All you care about is drachmae. Take it!

Id: [0x001F4D6C]
Say that again.

Id: [0x001F4D6E]
Guess what, murex man. Now you owe me double.

Id: [0x001F4D71]
OK! Take whatever you want! Just let me go!

Id: [0x001F4D73]
You'll regret this!

Id: [0x001F4D79]
I just lost a lot of drachmae - I'm not in the mood.

Id: [0x001F4D7D]
I have bad news.

Id: [0x001F4D7E]
Spit it out.

Id: [0x001F4D8A]
The pirates sunk the ship. We were overwhelmed.

Id: [0x001F4D8B]
There was nothing I could do.

Id: [0x001F4D8C]
You had one job, misthios! To bring that cargo back safely.

Id: [0x001F4D8D]
Then there's nothing I can pay you for. Leave.

Id: [0x001F4D8F]
Your captain attacked me when I approached, then sailed north, away from Skandeia Harbor.

Id: [0x001F4D90]
That traitor!

Id: [0x001F4D9A]
She's a dead woman. Take this.

Id: [0x001F4D9C]
Now get out of my way.

Id: [0x001F4D9F]
There was nothing left to escort. The ship was nowhere to be seen.

Id: [0x001F4DA0]
Nowhere to be seen?! Was it pirates, or did my crew betray me?

Id: [0x001F4DA1]
Could have been either.

Id: [0x001F4DA2]
If you can't give me anything, you aren't getting anything. Get out of my way.

Id: [0x001F4DB3]
No pay, no play! If you want your precious hetaerae, go to the Temple of Aphrodite.

Id: [0x001F4DB4]
And, did you go to Thera? Did you find... him?

Id: [0x001F4DB6]
I did.

Id: [0x001F4DB7]
What did he tell you?

Id: [0x001F4DC4]
[&phew]Phew.[/&phew]

Id: [0x001F4DC8]
Can you tell me where they've gone?

Id: [0x001F4DC9]
I haven't seen 'em since, I swear it! I can't afford to pay 'em.

Id: [0x001F4DCA]
"Pushed out?" So someone didn't want them here.

Id: [0x001F4DCB]
We don't like to say his name - in case his men overhear. Just know the hetaerae were forced to move out of Korinth's markets.

Id: [0x001F4DCE]
Just minding my own business, <i>misthios</i>! I'm sure someone here can help you.

Id: [0x001F4DD2]
He told me where I'm from and where I must go.

Id: [0x001F4DD3]
So now you know the truth.

Id: [0x001F4DD4]
I'm not his daughter. I'm just a... weapon.

Id: [0x001F4DD5]
That is the furthest thing from the truth. You were brought into this world with love.

Id: [0x001F4DD9]
Not yet.

Id: [0x001F4DDA]
You should. The answers to many of your questions are there. Your father would be proud to see how you've grown.

Id: [0x001F4DDD]
For now, let's deal with what needs to be done here.

Id: [0x001F4DE0]
Let's focus on what needs to be done in Sparta.

Id: [0x001F4DE2]
[&breath][sighs][/&breath]You can keep it secret if that's what you want. But you don't have to carry all of your burdens alone. Not anymore.

Id: [0x001F4DE3]
I know<i>.</i>

Id: [0x001F4DE5]
I never imagined we'd stand on Spartan soil together again.

Id: [0x001F4DF1]
So the Monger is a Korinthian criminal?

Id: [0x001F4DF3]
He craves money, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F4DF8]
Remind me where to find the hetaerae.

Id: [0x001F4DFA]
Go halfway down the mountain - to the Spring of Peirene.

Id: [0x001F4E01]
As soon as you were old enough to hold a spear, you trained in this yard from morning till night.

Id: [0x001F4E02]
Nikolaos was a tough teacher to please.

Id: [0x001F4E03]
He hid his pride from you. But every night he would tell me, "she's going to bring glory to Sparta."

Id: [0x001F4E07]
Ah, so Kassandra has finally found us.

Id: [0x001F4E0A]
And you know her. This is Anthousa.

Id: [0x001F4E0D]
Hear that, Ikaros? Her sight's as good as yours.

Id: [0x001F4E0E]
We need to move inside, Kassandra. We're not the only ones watching. [beat]Come with me, and we'll talk.

Id: [0x001F4E13]
To what do I owe your visit?

Id: [0x001F4E14]
Alkibiades told me about you.

Id: [0x001F4E15]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]Did he? Go on.

Id: [0x001F4E16]
I'm looking for a woman from Sparta - a runaway, long ago. She may have gone by the name of Myrrine.

Id: [0x001F4E18]
I see. [beat]There will be time to respond to your question, but that time isn't now.

Id: [0x001F4E34]
That's not the answer I'm looking for.

Id: [0x001F4E35]
It's the only one you'll get until I've bargained a proper exchange. I've become quite the businesswoman, after all.

Id: [0x001F4E37]
As long as you tell me what you know sooner or later.

Id: [0x001F4E38]
You'll have to trust me. You don't get to where I stand without credibility. My word is yours.

Id: [0x001F4E50]
[&phew]As much as I hate him for what he did, I wouldn't be who I am today without his training.

Id: [0x001F4E51]
My heart broke that day. But for the first time in ages, standing here with you, I truly believe it can mend again.

Id: [0x001F4E54]
If he were a better man, he wouldn't have let go of me.

Id: [0x001F4E56]
My heart broke that day. But if we are ever to heal, as a family, we must stop re-opening old wounds.

Id: [0x001F4E66]
This line explains the <i>problem</i> at hand.

Id: [0x001F4E7C]
Some wounds never close.

Id: [0x001F4E81]
Me too.

Id: [0x001F5047]
Now. [beat]You've heard of the Monger?

Id: [0x001F5048]
I heard about him after I killed his men. Seems he's famous in Korinth.

Id: [0x001F5049]
For all the wrong reasons. His knife has shed much Korinthian blood - but that's just the way of commerce. The blood between us is <i>bad</i>.

Id: [0x001F504A]
Exactly. Go to his warehouse in the Port of Lechaion and burn his cargo. All of it. We'll let chaos take care of the rest.

Id: [0x001F504E]
I'll try.

Id: [0x001F5080]
Help! Won't somebody help me?

Id: [0x001F5087]
Help! Come help me!

Id: [0x001F50AA]
As I waited outside, I heard shouts and roars, then his men came pouring out -

Id: [0x001F50AB]
His men, but not <i>pater</i>. [beat]I need to save him.

Id: [0x001F50BA]
You must be the Hoarder?

Id: [0x001F50BB]
The Collector!

Id: [0x001F50BC]
Dust Collector, maybe.

Id: [0x001F50BF]
The... No, no, no, I don't - I can't - I don't know anything about the Minotaur!

Id: [0x001F50C8]
I'm not here to break bones, I'm here for information. Give it to me and I'll be on my way.

Id: [0x001F50C9]
I'll answer your questions, but you won't ask the right one.

Id: [0x001F50D1]
What you saw has scarred you.

Id: [0x001F50D3]
Those scars are starting to fade. Perhaps you'd like some fresh ones?

Id: [0x001F50D5]
No - please - I have answers! If you aim to survive that - that beast in the labyrinth, I know what you'll need!

Id: [0x001F50DF]
You said you sold Theseus's armor. Who has it?

Id: [0x001F50E0]
A military commander, stationed in the fort. He has a cave filled with all sorts of prizes. The armor is his crown jewel.

Id: [0x001F50E2]
What happened to you in the labyrinth?

Id: [0x001F50E3]
What happens to a fly in a web? Three of us went inside. We were marrow sucked from bone, <i>misthios</i>. A special disk opened the entrance, and a golden string lead through to our doom. <LF>

Id: [0x001F50E4]
You survived.

Id: [0x001F50E6]
How can you be so sure?

Id: [0x001F517C]
My idiot husband's not going to find himself, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x001F51DB]
The old man said you stole something from him.

Id: [0x001F51DE]
Swordfish mentioned something about putting the key in the stele.

Id: [0x001F51E7]
I've met the Collector. He mentioned we'll need a key to get inside the labyrinth.

Id: [0x001F52D7]
Yeah! There's a <i>creepy </i>looking trapdoor beneath the temple!

Id: [0x001F52D9]
Take me there, and I will slay the Minotaur and find your pater's -

Id: [0x001F52DC]
You - you'll do that?

Id: [0x001F52DE]
The Minotaur will die, and I will find your <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x001F52E9]
Apologies my king, she's been away from Sparta for a long time.

Id: [0x001F52EA]
This one has fire like her mother.

Id: [0x001F52EE]
I don't! But the guys who went into the labyrinth with my pater will! I've tried talking to them but -

Id: [0x001F52EF]
They'll speak to me. Who are these people?

Id: [0x001F52FE]
Okay, so, my old caretaker recently sent me a message about wanting to meet in Phaistos.

Id: [0x001F5303]
Oh! And the last guy! They call him -

Id: [0x001F5304]
<i>"Swordfish"? </i>He must have a long, pointy nose.

Id: [0x001F5305]
No, no! He's really good with a sword and...

Id: [0x001F5306]
He's really good with fish? I guess?

Id: [0x001F5307]
He's the boss of Octopus Bay. And he's mean.

Id: [0x001F530C]
No.

Id: [0x001F530E]
[breath]You're already forgotten.

Id: [0x001F5324]
Sisters! As decreed by our law, as set down by Artemis herself, the time of my trial has arrived.

Id: [0x001F5329]
By Hades! What's going on here?

Id: [0x001F532A]
It's all right. You have nothing to fear.

Id: [0x001F5332]
Should I be honored, or concerned?

Id: [0x001F5337]
About your family?

Id: [0x001F5338]
There are secrets... Someone important told me she would be able to help me understand.

Id: [0x001F5339]
Yes, we do.

Id: [0x001F533A]
We'll reach Naxos soon.

Id: [0x001F533B]
Yes, although I don't think it's over yet.

Id: [0x001F533C]
Where will you go?

Id: [0x001F533D]
I doubt there's a speck of land in the Aegean where you don't know someone.

Id: [0x001F533E]
[&laughs]You might be right. It comes with the profession I suppose.

Id: [0x001F533F]
And who knows, maybe I'll see you again.

Id: [0x001F5340]
It doesn't seem that big of an island. Anything's possible.

Id: [0x001F5341]
I'd like to know if all the trouble to find Phoenix was worth it.

Id: [0x001F5342]
[&hmm]I'd like to know too.

Id: [0x001F5347]
Enough with the mysteries. I want the truth.

Id: [0x001F5349]
Every generation, Artemis sends her messengers into the wild. These creatures are a sign to her Daughters that a challenger walks the world. One worthy to lead.

Id: [0x001F534A]
Lead? What are you talking about?

Id: [0x001F534C]
Defeat me in mortal combat, and take up the mantle of leader of the Daughters of Artemis. Refuse, and you shall be nothing to us, as you were before.

Id: [0x001F535F]
Anything a mercenary can help you with today, merchant?

Id: [0x001F537C]
<i>Chaire</i>, merchant. Need something?

Id: [0x001F53A6]
Merchant, need a hand?

Id: [0x001F546D]
Who am I to deny the will of the gods?

Id: [0x001F546F]
Artemis, my fate is in your hands.

Id: [0x001F5471]
No. It's not my place to lead your people.

Id: [0x001F5472]
You coward. Then go, and do not look back on us. Your path is not ours.

Id: [0x001F5473]
Daphnae, I can't kill you. I thought we'd become... friends.

Id: [0x001F5478]
This is the way of my people. I don't make the rules. I follow the will of the goddess. I cherish our [beat]friendship, but Artemis and tradition-

Id: [0x001F5479]
Malákes traditions! I will not take the life of someone I respect, I admire, I...

Id: [0x001F547A]
Would you spit in the eyes of the gods?

Id: [0x001F547C]
If tradition is all you care about, I won't stand in its way.

Id: [0x001F5493]
I'm not through, I won't be forgotten - for all I've done.

Id: [0x001F5494]
You're not worth the memory.

Id: [0x001F54EA]
Why rob people who can't put two <i>drachmae</i> together if he has a business? It's illegitimate, but gets him rich.

Id: [0x001F54EB]
Even the smuggling is a front. He steals slaves - innocents, who shouldn't be harmed. But his thugs can burn.

Id: [0x001F54FE]
Seems to me that burning his biggest source of income is asking for trouble.

Id: [0x001F54FF]
I want to put the new muscle I've acquired on show. Plus, violence is the only language he understands.

Id: [0x001F5500]
I know many people who speak that language.

Id: [0x001F558F]
From the moment we first met, I felt a... <i>kinship</i>. Tell me you don't feel it, too.

Id: [0x001F5590]
Whatever you feel... I cannot reciprocate.

Id: [0x001F5591]
I... see.

Id: [0x001F5592]
I've lived my life as a servant of Artemis, and as a mother to her children. I cannot betray them.

Id: [0x001F5593]
Then I won't ask you to. If this is what you want, let's get it over with quickly.

Id: [0x001F559B]
If Archidamos believes in the old ways, won't killing his <i>krypteia </i>create conflict between him and Pausanias?

Id: [0x001F559C]
I miss Kephallonia sometimes.[&breath] Life was simple. Even if Markos was a bumbling idiot.

Id: [0x001F55A1]
A good friend? Of course. Yet Anaxagoras seems pleased with the result. This day has brought more questions than answers.

Id: [0x001F55A5]
I can't stand here doing nothing. I'm going to help them.

Id: [0x001F55A7]
A blockade?

Id: [0x001F55A8]
I've refused to pay tribute to Athens, and Paros is taking advantage of the situation.

Id: [0x001F55AA]
I hope you're right. For their sake.

Id: [0x001F55AE]
The agoge is what turns boys into men. Interfering would only weaken them, weaken Sparta.

Id: [0x001F55AF]
They're no good to Sparta if we leave them to die.

Id: [0x001F55B4]
Come. Let's go home.

Id: [0x001F55BD]
What happened to you in Argolis after that night?

Id: [0x001F55BE]
I found your brother and rushed to a young doctor's apprentice, Hippokrates. I thought I'd lost you... I wasn't ready to lose you both.

Id: [0x001F55BF]
I spoke with him recently. That night still haunts him.

Id: [0x001F55C0]
I was heartbroken when the healers in Asklepios told me Alexios was dead. The two of you were my whole world.

Id: [0x001F55C1]
But he did live, they lied to you.

Id: [0x001F55C2]
They... must have realized he was special and handed him over to the Cult.

Id: [0x001F55C4]
I want to know about my real father.

Id: [0x001F55C5]
[&gasp]How[/&gaps] did you know?

Id: [0x001F55C6]
I was told.

Id: [0x001F55C7]
Nikolaos? You saw him?

Id: [0x001F55C8]
In Megaris, yes.

Id: [0x001F55C9]
Nikolaos was your father. He was the man who raised you... until he took his Spartan duty too far.

Id: [0x001F55CA]
He mentioned another... What can you tell me about him?

Id: [0x001F55CB]
I always hoped you would never need to discover the truth, but there are things you need to know if we are to stop the Cult.

Id: [0x001F55CC]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001F55CD]
He sought me out before I knew your fa... Nikolaos. I've not heard from him in a long time.

Id: [0x001F55D0]
But are you sure you have enough proof to accuse him?

Id: [0x001F55E8]
Come. Let's go home.

Id: [0x001F55EB]
[&gasp]Why are you doing this? You're killing me!

Id: [0x001F55EC]
Daphnae...

Id: [0x001F55EE]
No!

Id: [0x001F5612]
We'll save him from the Cult, <i>mater</i>. We'll get him back.

Id: [0x001F5613]
The Cult is insidious, once they have their claws in, they don't let go. I fear he is beyond saving.

Id: [0x001F5614]
I found you, didn't I? I know we can save him, together.

Id: [0x001F5616]
He's been brainwashed. He believes he is doing what's right.

Id: [0x001F5617]
Some have successfully abandoned the Cult. We could bring him back.

Id: [0x001F5618]
We owe it to him to try.

Id: [0x001F5623]
You've done some incredible things. Naxos is lucky to have you as its leader.

Id: [0x001F5624]
It's not been without its difficulties, but I'm proud of what we've achieved.

Id: [0x001F5625]
It's a pity there aren't more leaders like you.

Id: [0x001F5627]
What about Sparta? You know what's happening there, and it needs your help like Naxos once did.

Id: [0x001F5628]
I thought about returning on more than one occasion, but it was too painful.

Id: [0x001F5629]
Sometimes the most painful things are the things we should do.

Id: [0x001F562B]
The Cult will pay for all they've done to our family and the Greek world.

Id: [0x001F562C]
You are mighty, lamb, but you cannot defeat that beast with sword and spear alone.

Id: [0x001F562D]
I'll use any weapon I can to make them suffer as we have.

Id: [0x001F562F]
Many have tried to stop them and failed.

Id: [0x001F5630]
We are not those people. Where others failed, we will succeed.

Id: [0x001F5640]
Why didn't you tell me the truth about Nikolaos?

Id: [0x001F5641]
You were just a child, you looked up to him. I couldn't bring myself to take that from you then, and I'm sorry you know now.

Id: [0x001F5642]
I've been sheltered from the truth long enough.

Id: [0x001F5644]
Knowing would only have complicated things.

Id: [0x001F5645]
You still had a right to know the truth.

Id: [0x001F5646]
You did what you thought was best, like any mother.

Id: [0x001F564B]
Please... Take care of my sisters. Whatever our differences, I have to know they're safe.

Id: [0x001F565E]
I'll lead them well.

Id: [0x001F5661]
I don't know how to live up to your legacy, but I'll try.

Id: [0x001F5666]
I'm glad to leave my sisters to someone I... love.

Id: [0x001F566A]
May Artemis guide your sight.

Id: [0x001F566C]
The symposium?

Id: [0x001F566D]
I need to show the people their leader is strong and in control.

Id: [0x001F566F]
Sometimes the face we show to the world needs to be one of strength, despite the chaos we harbor beneath.

Id: [0x001F5681]
The disk from Ligeia's story. I hope it opens the Writhing Dread's lair like they say.

Id: [0x001F5698]
That's why I want you to make them suffer like we have - so that our living can find peace, and our dead can be -

Id: [0x001F56A3]
Swooooooordfish.

Id: [0x001F56A5]
My spear is yours.

Id: [0x001F56A6]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. You have no idea how much this means to us.

Id: [0x001F56A9]
...Find your <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x001F56B0]
Where is he then? You said the labyrinth was beneath us -

Id: [0x001F56B5]
You'll have to find another <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F56B6]
If you gain a conscience, come see me again.

Id: [0x001F56BA]
The Followers of Ares live in caves among the mountain ranges of Zeus's Playground.

Id: [0x001F56BC]
Don't worry, we'll find a way. You must know <i>something</i>.

Id: [0x001F56C1]
If you don't know how to get in there, I swear -

Id: [0x001F56D9]
He's made a lot enemies with his... charm.

Id: [0x001F56DA]
At least he's safe from any danger I may have caused him.

Id: [0x001F56DE]
I won't let anyone hurt him.

Id: [0x001F56E0]
Though I do sometimes think about strangling him myself.

Id: [0x001F56E2]
I'm looking for a way into the labyrinth[2405403]. Ardos said you might know something.

Id: [0x001F56E3]
I know this - that place is death.

Id: [0x001F56E5]
Ardos has been known to test even the most resolute of wills.

Id: [0x001F5705]
There's nothing wrong with my armor.

Id: [0x001F570D]
If I speak, he might not listen. The truth is armor against little, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F570F]
Ardos! The boy. Never talk to the boy. We all promised.

Id: [0x001F5719]
I'll go in your place and see what I find.

Id: [0x001F571C]
And the Collector is this guy who buys weird stuff. He's a merchant in Gortyn.

Id: [0x001F571D]
I've "borrowed" some trinkets from him. He has so many he never even noticed.

Id: [0x001F5727]
Did you finally grow a conscience? The Followers of Ares need to be dealt with <i>now.</i>

Id: [0x001F5729]
Did you need something, misthios?

Id: [0x001F572B]
The Followers of Ares are with Hades now.

Id: [0x001F572E]
Thank you, misthios. How can we repay you?

Id: [0x001F5806]
Nothing is free in this world, especially my time.

Id: [0x001F5807]
I understand misthios, I only wish we could give you more.

Id: [0x001F580C]
I have more questions.

Id: [0x001F580E]
His father's son.

Id: [0x001F580F]
You remember him fondly enough, yet you refuse to speak to him.

Id: [0x001F5810]
Son of Nikios. Stubborn. A little shit.

Id: [0x001F5811]
Don't let me catch you "borrowing" from me.

Id: [0x001F5812]
From you? I would never!

Id: [0x001F5813]
...Get caught.

Id: [0x001F5819]
You can't put a price on justice. Those men deserved the end they got.

Id: [0x001F581A]
You gave us something drachmae can't buy... peace. For that we'll be forever grateful.

Id: [0x001F5821]
Sounds like a hard thing to part with.

Id: [0x001F5822]
No. Easy. [&breath]That armor... [&breath]it would have saved Nikios. It would have saved the boys' father. Yet I wore it. I didn't deserve... [&breath]The armor haunted me. No point keeping ghosts in my collection.

Id: [0x001F5825]
I'm here about the Minotaur.

Id: [0x001F5829]
The key to the labyrinth. A disk.

Id: [0x001F582F]
Insult me and my life's work if you must, just don't break anything.

Id: [0x001F5832]
She [beat]chose [beat]well.

Id: [0x001F583A]
If we put the disk into the stele, the entrance to the labyrinth should open.

Id: [0x001F583C]
Then I see about a minotaur.

Id: [0x001F5842]
The Athenian fleet couldn't carry your trinkets. What is this?

Id: [0x001F5847]
Down on your luck? Have I got a solution for you!

Id: [0x001F5851]
What's all this about?

Id: [0x001F5859]
I'm not sure yet.

Id: [0x001F585C]
Danger... Ha. I never back down from a challenge.

Id: [0x001F585D]
Then step right up and put your drachmae where your mouth is... For this kind of opportunity doesn't come around <i>every day</i>.

Id: [0x001F585F]
I love a good adventure.

Id: [0x001F5860]
And beneath her.

Id: [0x001F5861]
"Beneath?" Which of Krete's secrets have you unearthed?

Id: [0x001F5863]
I - uh, mostly dirt and bad poetry -

Id: [0x001F5865]
Been in any labyrinths recently?

Id: [0x001F5866]
No! Not - not recently! ...Long ago. I saw the true face of Krete. I saw its horns.

Id: [0x001F5868]
My collection, of course! Minoan artifacts. Thousands of years old. Found all over Krete.

Id: [0x001F5870]
The tablet reveals all!

Id: [0x001F5872]
What's going on? The chest was empty!

Id: [0x001F5873]
Inconceivable! Maybe you don't know how to read a tablet? I guarantee you there's something inside.

Id: [0x001F5874]
How can you be so sure?

Id: [0x001F5875]
Because I'm the one who put it there!

Id: [0x001F5876]
Uh... I mean... <i>maláka</i>!
<LF>

Id: [0x001F587D]
That's how.

Id: [0x001F587F]
The beast is dead. I saw its eyes roll back as it ran out of blood to bleed. Sleep easier.

Id: [0x001F5881]
Ow!

Id: [0x001F5882]
Why do you insist on being called the Collector?

Id: [0x001F5888]
No! No! No!

Id: [0x001F5892]
The <i>misthios</i> beat us to it!

Id: [0x001F5893]
The treasure is ours! Give it over!

Id: [0x001F5899]
Was there something else I could help you with?

Id: [0x001F589D]
"Off the east coast of Kythera, on Diakofti Island, your reward awaits."

Id: [0x001F58A1]
The Minotaur, he's very real. And he's very... very angry.

Id: [0x001F58A7]
This tablet! It's the same as mine! What's going on?

Id: [0x001F58AB]
Delightful!

Id: [0x001F58AE]
A key, huh. I don't know anything about a key.

Id: [0x001F58B2]
Did he tell you anything else? Anything about pater?

Id: [0x001F58B7]
He asked me to look out for you.

Id: [0x001F58B9]
...He said you're like your pater.

Id: [0x001F58BB]
We still need to find this key.

Id: [0x001F58C7]
Did you -

Id: [0x001F58D3]
I always wondered what it was for.

Id: [0x001F58D4]
What key?

Id: [0x001F58D9]
You summoned the ephors?

Id: [0x001F58DA]
You must have achieved some success to earn this adoring crowd.

Id: [0x001F58DE]
Are you ready to take back our family's land?

Id: [0x001F58DF]
Of course. But my purpose here is to bring down the Cultist king.

Id: [0x001F58E0]
You make your mother proud, Kassandra.

Id: [0x001F58E5]
I know you seek answers and I want you to have them, but some things are not for me to explain. Hopefully one day you will understand.

Id: [0x001F58EB]
I'm tired of searching for answers, and who's to say he can even give me them.

Id: [0x001F58EC]
I know this is difficult.

Id: [0x001F58ED]
It's like I don't even know myself anymore. Where I come from. Who I am.

Id: [0x001F58EE]
Kassandra, I promise you that he will have answers.

Id: [0x001F58F0]
Where to?

Id: [0x001F58F1]
We're going to destroy the fleet of Paros once and for all. Only then will Naxos be secure enough for us to leave.

Id: [0x001F58F6]
I can't be paid in knowledge.

Id: [0x001F58F7]
Ah, then you're driven by the desire for wealth.

Id: [0x001F58F8]
Drachmae is the one thing people need.

Id: [0x001F58F9]
Many believe they need more than they actually do.

Id: [0x001F58FA]
And others have to risk everything just to survive.

Id: [0x001F58FC]
Of course. Knowledge drives everything I do.

Id: [0x001F58FD]
Then we are the same in that way.

Id: [0x001F58FE]
Knowledge of when to attack, what weapon to use, or when to use reason instead of violence.

Id: [0x001F58FF]
We seem to put our love of knowledge into practice quite differently.

Id: [0x001F5900]
I use it how I need to.

Id: [0x001F5902]
You are clearly someone who would do whatever you feel is necessary. Perhaps for drachmae, or maybe to further a personal goal.

Id: [0x001F5903]
I did what I could. The flames were thick.

Id: [0x001F5906]
You're a spy too?

Id: [0x001F5907]
An old Spartan tactic. [&ahem]I have my ways.

Id: [0x001F592E]
We have done great things together for its people.

Id: [0x001F592F]
But now we must look beyond these shores and destroy the Cult.

Id: [0x001F5932]
It will be dangerous. Their hold on Sparta is strong.

Id: [0x001F5933]
Don't you think it's time we returned?

Id: [0x001F5936]
Naxos... seems secure.

Id: [0x001F5937]
They are everywhere, and nowhere. Their followers are without number. Where do we start?

Id: [0x001F5938]
We cut the heads off the beast one at a time until they are blind and defenseless.

Id: [0x001F5939]
Sparta.

Id: [0x001F593A]
Sparta?

Id: [0x001F593B]
I still have influence there, and allies. We can rally around our home and cleanse it of their influence as an example to the world.

Id: [0x001F593C]
Together.

Id: [0x001F5941]
Everything has a price.

Id: [0x001F5942]
And you're the one who decides when the pay is worth it.

Id: [0x001F5943]
I don't have the luxury of turning down a job.

Id: [0x001F5944]
What of duty? The greater good? Are they not their own kind of payment?

Id: [0x001F5945]
No. They're not.

Id: [0x001F5948]
Then working alongside Anthousa is your best bet.

Id: [0x001F594C]
My intentions are to hunt down those who betrayed my family and Sparta. And kill them.

Id: [0x001F594E]
And who exactly do you think betrayed Sparta?

Id: [0x001F594F]
That's what I'm here to find out.

Id: [0x001F5950]
Just because I'm a mercenary doesn't mean I'll do anything.

Id: [0x001F5951]
Even if the pay was more than adequate for the task?

Id: [0x001F5952]
Even then.

Id: [0x001F5953]
What if you were offered something you desperately needed? Something you couldn't get anywhere else? Would you move this line you've made for yourself?

Id: [0x001F5954]
My line has moved countless times since I was a child. But it still exists.

Id: [0x001F5957]
That describes a lot of people.

Id: [0x001F5958]
I suppose I'm curious why you did it. How could I not be when you're the reason my friend is being forced to leave the only home he's ever known?

Id: [0x001F595D]
He'll only be dethroned if he's killed. It's simple.

Id: [0x001F595E]
Yes, diplomacy isn't something he understands.

Id: [0x001F595F]
From what I hear, I'm not surprised.

Id: [0x001F5961]
What happened?

Id: [0x001F5976]
By the time I leave Korinthia, the Monger will be dead.

Id: [0x001F5977]
Do that, and Sparta will be in your debt.

Id: [0x001F597A]
How dare you show your face in Sparta.

Id: [0x001F597C]
Let's hear what they have to say before we bloody the palace floor.

Id: [0x001F597F]
My intentions are to return home. Here. Where I was born.

Id: [0x001F5981]
What happened on Taygetos brought shame on Sparta. You and your family have no home here.

Id: [0x001F59CF]
I brought home a wreath for Sparta, though I had to enter the Games and win it myself.

Id: [0x001F59D0]
Very good. But what of our Pankration champion, Testikles?

Id: [0x001F59D1]
Games are hardly important. What about Boeotia?

Id: [0x001F59D2]
Stentor and I defeated the Athenian forces. You have nothing to worry about.

Id: [0x001F59D5]
I suppose you were too busy conquering territory to bring our champion to the Olympic Games?

Id: [0x001F59D6]
The Athenian forces in Boeotia are no more. The land is yours.

Id: [0x001F59D7]
That's excellent news.

Id: [0x001F59D8]
I brought him to Elis... but he had an accident at sea.

Id: [0x001F59D9]
By Nike! Well done, champion.

Id: [0x001F59DB]
We were told serious charges would be brought.

Id: [0x001F59E4]
And if we don't like what they have to say, you can chop off any limb you see fit.

Id: [0x001F59FA]
You're untied. Go!

Id: [0x001F5A55]
There was an accident at sea before he could compete.

Id: [0x001F5A56]
So I entered the Games myself and won a wreath for Sparta.

Id: [0x001F5A8B]
Serious charges? Against whom?

Id: [0x001F5B03]
I did what I was asked to do.

Id: [0x001F5B05]
I think you have the wrong person.

Id: [0x001F5B08]
They helped us secure Korinthia, my king. I beg you to listen.

Id: [0x001F5B49]
Kassandra helped me secure Korinthia, my king. She helped with the helot rebellion. They want what's best for Sparta. I beg you to listen.

Id: [0x001F5B73]
Not to mention the crooked nose she gave you.

Id: [0x001F5B75]
My family was betrayed, my king. Sparta was betrayed. We've come to expose these traitors.

Id: [0x001F5B8E]
Kassandra, not here!

Id: [0x001F5B9E]
You are claiming that <i>you</i> are the wrong person? Life's one true happiness is knowing yourself.

Id: [0x001F5BA0]
Even if I did know who rigged the ostracism vote, I wouldn't tell you.

Id: [0x001F5BA1]
And yet, I never said anyone rigged anything.

Id: [0x001F5BC3]
Tell me what I must do, and it will be done.

Id: [0x001F5BC5]
Sokrates. There you are.

Id: [0x001F5BC7]
Here I am.

Id: [0x001F5BC8]
You're late. They're all waiting for you.

Id: [0x001F5BC9]
I wished to see Anaxagoras's fate. And so I have. Tell them I'm on my way.

Id: [0x001F5BCB]
Well, it seems our conversation is at its end. Although I hope it isn't the final one we have.

Id: [0x001F5BCC]
I wouldn't know.

Id: [0x001F5BD0]
Then I hope you also think about today. About Anaxagoras. About choice.

Id: [0x001F5BD2]
Not so fast.

Id: [0x001F5BD4]
And what would you have me do? Conquer the rest of the world?

Id: [0x001F5BD7]
I'd leave the conquering to Archidamos.

Id: [0x001F5BE0]
Chains? Oil? [beat]This can't be what I think it is.

Id: [0x001F5BE7]
You want me to be an escort?

Id: [0x001F5BE8]
[&cough]That's how she'll bring glory to Sparta? By winning an event in the Olympics?

Id: [0x001F5BEF]
It's gone...

Id: [0x001F5BF1]
What's gone?

Id: [0x001F5BF2]
There was a skull here, a small rabbit skull. From your first hunt.

Id: [0x001F5BF3]
Why would someone take that?

Id: [0x001F5BF4]
There is only one person who would have taken it. Nikolaos...

Id: [0x001F5BFA]
Maybe seeing each other again made him think of this place. It did the same to me.

Id: [0x001F5BFB]
Seems I wasn't the only one yearning for home.

Id: [0x001F5BFD]
This house has been vacant for a long time. Many robbers could have come and gone.

Id: [0x001F5BFE]
They would have no reason to take an old rabbit skull.

Id: [0x001F5BFF]
Maybe they thought it was valuable. It was on display, after all.

Id: [0x001F5C00]
Perhaps...

Id: [0x001F5C5C]
Myrrine has made her intentions known. What are yours?

Id: [0x001F5C67]
Gotcha! [beat]All right you little shit, who sent you?

Id: [0x001F5C6E]
[&breath][sighs][/&breath]Perfect.

Id: [0x001F5C6F]
That went well.

Id: [0x001F5C70]
Considering you still have a head on your shoulders, yes I'd say it went very well.

Id: [0x001F5C75]
And all I have to do is win the Olympics.

Id: [0x001F5C76]
Is there anything you need to know before setting off?

Id: [0x001F5C77]
I'll get them done, and you'll give us back our home.

Id: [0x001F5C78]
Brasidas, show them out.

Id: [0x001F5C79]
If you've got the drachmae and the time, I've got a once-in-a-lifetime adventure just for you!

Id: [0x001F5C7A]
Tell me more.

Id: [0x001F5C7B]
Secrecy is key, <i>misthios</i>. We can't just have anyone knowing there's a fortune to be found.

Id: [0x001F5C7E]
Did the thrill of adventure bring you back to me, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001F5C84]
I've got better things to do.

Id: [0x001F5C85]
You have no idea what you're missing out on, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F5C87]
Here you go.

Id: [0x001F5C8B]
Excellent! Here you go.

Id: [0x001F5C8D]
What? Just tell me where -

Id: [0x001F5C8E]
The tablet reveals all!

Id: [0x001F5C8F]
What does that even mean?

Id: [0x001F5C90]
Just look at tablet and follow the directions, <i>misthios</i>! My work here is done.

Id: [0x001F5C93]
Tell me about the item they wanted you to steal.

Id: [0x001F5C94]
Truth is, I don't even think they knew exactly what it is. After I killed the Creature I went to search the lair, but it was sealed.

Id: [0x001F5C9D]
I'll take the spear - and let you live.

Id: [0x001F5CA0]
I'd like to buy your spear if you'll sell it.

Id: [0x001F5CA3]
We're warriors - to let it go without a fight would be to dishonor my fallen friends.

Id: [0x001F5CA6]
Empty?! I'm going to snap that man's neck in two.

Id: [0x001F5CA8]
Or if that isn't enough to satisfy you -

Id: [0x001F5CA9]
<i>I </i>will.

Id: [0x001F5CAA]
Well, it has been awhile since I've -

Id: [0x001F5CAB]
<i>Communed </i>with the gods?

Id: [0x001F5CAD]
You drive a hard bargain.

Id: [0x001F5CAE]
So, what do you need me to do?

Id: [0x001F5CAF]
Lots of it.

Id: [0x001F5CB0]
But drachmae it is.

Id: [0x001F5CB1]
And drachmae.

Id: [0x001F5CB3]
You don't know what you're missing, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F5CB7]
It's not enough. This kind of opportunity doesn't come cheap! Come back when you have more.

Id: [0x001F5CBC]
In all my life, I've never seen him so peaceful. I hope he's found <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x001F5CBD]
You silly old man. Is this why you left Pephka? To fetch mater flowers so far from home?

Id: [0x001F5CBE]
I've already helped you get to the city <i>alive</i>.

Id: [0x001F5CBF]
If you want any more from me, <i>pay</i> me.

Id: [0x001F5CC0]
You're being greedy, priestess.

Id: [0x001F5CC1]
Ooh... I like it when you get aggressive.

Id: [0x001F5CC8]
Where's the boy?! Ardos?!

Id: [0x001F5CD0]
Don't worry about Ardos. He's safe, far from here.

Id: [0x001F5CD4]
He was skilled. I've seen worse.

Id: [0x001F5CD6]
Maybe I was just that much better.

Id: [0x001F5CDC]
Don't you recognize me? Remember all the times we shared? The secrets?

Id: [0x001F5CDD]
No, I didn't!

Id: [0x001F5CE1]
Don't take me for a fool!

Id: [0x001F5CE5]
Swordfish mentioned there was a place to put the disk - in a stele.

Id: [0x001F5CE6]
Ooh! So what do we do now?

Id: [0x001F5CE8]
I was told to expect an old man. You don't look the part.

Id: [0x001F5CEC]
[&hmm]Where is he?!

Id: [0x001F5CFA]
I-it's very important I see him.

Id: [0x001F5CFE]
Pay up, and I'll give you a tablet with everything you need to know.

Id: [0x001F5D01]
And... and you'll save my pater too right?

Id: [0x001F5D05]
I promised I'd save your pater, didn't I?

Id: [0x001F5D07]
You're the best, misthios!

Id: [0x001F5D09]
Ardos. I don't -

Id: [0x001F5D0B]
I don't think your pater is still -

Id: [0x001F5D0D]
He's alive! I know it! We just have to hurry!

Id: [0x001F5D35]
<i>Maláka</i>... What will I do now?

Id: [0x001F5D38]
I never went inside. I'm not a <i>fool. </i>But Nikios wanted me to watch the boy.

Id: [0x001F5D3C]
Where's <i>pater</i>?

Id: [0x001F5D40]
The Minotaur is dead. Thanks for your help, Ardos.

Id: [0x001F5D4A]
I searched the labyrinth and -

Id: [0x001F5D53]
I'm sorry, Ardos -

Id: [0x001F5D54]
Sorry? Why?

Id: [0x001F5D56]
I didn't find him. There's no way anyone but me could have survived down there.

Id: [0x001F5D57]
My <i>pater</i> was fast! And really smart. If anyone could've, it would've been him -

Id: [0x001F5D5B]
Listen -

Id: [0x001F5D5D]
You said you'd bring him back.

Id: [0x001F5D5E]
Your pater and I will be back before you know it.

Id: [0x001F5D5F]
Let's head to the entrance and try out the disk!

Id: [0x001F5D60]
You lied. Go back in there and find him!

Id: [0x001F5D61]
<i>He's dead, Ardos!</i>

Id: [0x001F5D63]
We can't raise the dead.

Id: [0x001F5D64]
But we can move on.

Id: [0x001F5D69]
I'm afraid I'll forget him.

Id: [0x001F5D6D]
Ardos, the Minotaur was no ordinary monster.

Id: [0x001F5D6F]
And <i>pater</i> isn't just a regular guy. He's a hero!

Id: [0x001F5D70]
He might've been your hero, but -

Id: [0x001F5D71]
He must be alive! Find him!

Id: [0x001F5D73]
Ardos -

Id: [0x001F5D75]
You promised!

Id: [0x001F5D7A]
I don't want to forget him.

Id: [0x001F5D7D]
I'm sorry... there's nothing more I can do for you.

Id: [0x001F5D7E]
Still, you tried. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F5D8C]
Take it, to remember him by.

Id: [0x001F5D8D]
<i>Pater's</i> ring!

Id: [0x001F5D92]
Thank you!

Id: [0x001F5D94]
...Thank you.

Id: [0x001F5D98]
Then why do they think Ardos has it?

Id: [0x001F5D99]
Because he does. He stole it from me. [beat]And I told them about it.

Id: [0x001F5DAD]
How can anyone tell a boy the person he looks up to - his father and only family - is dead?!

Id: [0x001F5DAF]
[&cry]They tortured me, misthios! [&ah]I - I tried not to break.

Id: [0x001F5DB7]
The people who tortured you belong to a powerful cult. They have broken stronger men than you.

Id: [0x001F5DBA]
You sold out a small boy and put him in danger!

Id: [0x001F5DBC]
Luckily he's resourceful, smart, and has more backbone than you ever will.

Id: [0x001F5DC1]
He'll be safe with me.

Id: [0x001F5DC2]
[&scoff]About the disk. He doesn't know its true purpose, misthios. With it, you'll be able to open the labyrinth.

Id: [0x001F5DCC]
Just promise to keep him safe.

Id: [0x001F5DCD]
You can still make things right with Ardos.

Id: [0x001F5DD8]
He told me where to find Theseus's armor.

Id: [0x001F5DD9]
And now it's mine.

Id: [0x001F5DDA]
Whoa! No way!

Id: [0x001F5DDC]
I told you the labyrinth was full of awesome treasures!

Id: [0x001F5DDD]
Did he tell you anything else?

Id: [0x001F5DE0]
What? He never even wanted to talk to me! I figured he hated my guts.

Id: [0x001F5DE2]
Really?

Id: [0x001F5DE3]
That's nice to know.

Id: [0x001F5DE4]
He didn't have anything else important to say.

Id: [0x001F5DE5]
Pfft, he's a weird man anyway.

Id: [0x001F5DF4]
A key? Like the one the Collector mentioned?

Id: [0x001F5DF5]
That has to be it. Our last hope is the old man.

Id: [0x001F5DF6]
I hope he knows <i>something</i> about this key.

Id: [0x001F5DFD]
Wow, guess he wasn't as good as they said he was.

Id: [0x001F5DFE]
I cut him down with ease.

Id: [0x001F5DFF]
You should have seen his pitiful face as I ran him through with my blade.

Id: [0x001F5E2A]
Of course.

Id: [0x001F5E35]
So did I. But we can't run from anything anymore.

Id: [0x001F5E36]
Agreed.

Id: [0x001F5E6B]
This is where I first trained you to use your spear.

Id: [0x001F5E6C]
"Hesitation only hastens the grave."

Id: [0x001F5E6D]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]You remembered.

Id: [0x001F5E6E]
How do you think I got this far?

Id: [0x001F5E6F]
We had to pry that spear from your hand while you slept. You said you needed it to fight the monsters in your dreams.

Id: [0x001F5E70]
I couldn't face Cerberus empty handed.

Id: [0x001F5E91]
And they're no good to Sparta if they're too weak to kill a wolf.

Id: [0x001F5EAD]
Sparta must be rid of Pausanias before it's too late. He's a member of the Cult of Kosmos and a traitor to Sparta!

Id: [0x001F5EB3]
A Kosmos cult? What are you going on about?

Id: [0x001F5EB5]
Is this some kind of joke?

Id: [0x001F5EB6]
I have the proof right here.

Id: [0x001F5EB8]
Our home, lamb.

Id: [0x001F5EBA]
Let's leave the court to its business. Meet me outside.

Id: [0x001F5EBD]
Hold out your spear.

Id: [0x001F5EE5]
That people would try to take that power for themselves.

Id: [0x001F5EE6]
And then you promised...

Id: [0x001F5EE7]
I wouldn't let them.

Id: [0x001F5EEA]
When you've dealt with him, meet me at home.

Id: [0x001F5EEB]
With pleasure.

Id: [0x001F5EED]
When you've dealt with him, meet me at Leonidas's tomb. I must show you something important.

Id: [0x001F5EEE]
I'll find you there, <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x001F5EF1]
Hold out your spear.

Id: [0x001F5EF2]
You carry the blood of heroes. You can carve much more than the path of a mercenary.

Id: [0x001F5EF4]
Hold out your spear.

Id: [0x001F5EF6]
You know what you have to do. Pausanias must die.

Id: [0x001F5EF8]
What must I do?

Id: [0x001F5EF9]
It's time we embrace our destiny - both of us. If we don't stop the Cult before it's too late, then all Leonidas fought and died for was for nothing.

Id: [0x001F5EFB]
Our bloodline has risen to those who would enslave us.

Id: [0x001F5EFC]
It's time we rise again.

Id: [0x001F5EFE]
I found proof he was a member of the Cult of Kosmos. Undeniable proof.

Id: [0x001F5F00]
This letter was written and signed by Pausanias's own hand, outlining the progress of their plans in Sparta.

Id: [0x001F5F01]
What is this Cult of Kosmos? You've mentioned them over and over as if I should know.

Id: [0x001F5F02]
They're a secret group with one goal: to seize power. They are using this war to strengthen their position.

Id: [0x001F5F03]
I find it difficult to think Pausanias was using Sparta this whole time. We've ruled together for years...

Id: [0x001F5F04]
I'll speak with the ephors to confirm what you say, but if it's true, you deserve to be called a Spartan citizen once more. And, of course, your family home is yours again.

Id: [0x001F5F07]
We're examples of why these laws must change.

Id: [0x001F5F13]
Now do you understand? You were always meant to topple tyrants.

Id: [0x001F5F14]
What do I do now?

Id: [0x001F5F17]
Our bloodline has risen to those who would enslave us.

Id: [0x001F5F18]
It's time we rise again.

Id: [0x001F5F19]
We continue down the path our destiny has set. If we don't stop the Cult before it's too late, then all Leonidas fought and died for was for nothing.

Id: [0x001F5F1F]
I hope I'm not intruding.

Id: [0x001F5F20]
Brasidas! Come in!

Id: [0x001F5F21]
It's good to see the two of you back home.

Id: [0x001F5F22]
It feels good to be here.

Id: [0x001F5F23]
You're here instead of in training, what's wrong?

Id: [0x001F5F24]
I'm heading to Pylos as soon as I can. I think you may want to come as well.

Id: [0x001F5F29]
I'd be happy to return the favor. What's waiting for us in Pylos?

Id: [0x001F5F2A]
Glory. The Athenians are pushing the Spartans back even as we speak. It would be a devastating loss for Sparta, and I can't allow that to happen.

Id: [0x001F5F2B]
We've finally gotten our home back, and you want me to leave?

Id: [0x001F5F2C]
The Cultists appear to have lost their patience. Their moves in Pylos are bold and ruthless.

Id: [0x001F5F2D]
Is Deimos there?

Id: [0x001F5F2E]
I've heard rumors. If they're true, not even a phalanx of Spartans could stop him.

Id: [0x001F5F31]
If Deimos is in Pylos, we have to stop him.

Id: [0x001F5F32]
I'll wait for you at the ship, but be quick. Each moment we waste is another Spartan dead.

Id: [0x001F5F39]
Alexios is in Pylos...

Id: [0x001F5F3A]
You have to bring him back, Kassandra.

Id: [0x001F5F3B]
Bring him back?

Id: [0x001F5F3C]
We have our home again. We can be a family. It isn't too late.

Id: [0x001F5F44]
I'll bring him back. No matter what.

Id: [0x001F5F45]
This is serious, Kassandra. We may not get another chance.

Id: [0x001F5F46]
I understand. He must have seen the Cultists for what they truly are by now.

Id: [0x001F5F48]
I'll do what I can, <i>mater</i>, but I can't promise anything.

Id: [0x001F5F49]
Please, don't say that, yet.

Id: [0x001F5F4A]
The Cult of Kosmos has had too much time with him. He is beyond reason.

Id: [0x001F5F4C]
I can't do it. I wish I could tell you otherwise, but he's too far gone.

Id: [0x001F5F4D]
That can't be true. You both have the same blood coursing through your veins.

Id: [0x001F5F4E]
There's nothing we can do. He sees us as nothing more than obstacles in his path.

Id: [0x001F5F4F]
You can't just give up on family so easily. You didn't give up on me.

Id: [0x001F5F51]
It doesn't matter what you have to do. Bring back your brother. You <i>must</i>.

Id: [0x001F5F52]
Nothing will stop me.

Id: [0x001F5F54]
I shouldn't keep Brasidas waiting.

Id: [0x001F5F55]
Be safe, Kassandra.

Id: [0x001F5F59]
Isn't it worth trying everything we can?

Id: [0x001F5F5C]
And if I can't save my brother?

Id: [0x001F5F5D]
Then we will have tried. We thought him dead for so long. I refuse to give up just yet.

Id: [0x001F5F5E]
I'll do what I can. I should leave for Pylos now.

Id: [0x001F5F5F]
Be safe, Kassandra.

Id: [0x001F5F69]
We haven't been a family since I was thrown from that mountain. I won't pretend that bringing Deimos back will unmake the past.

Id: [0x001F5F6A]
You're giving up on your own brother. On us?

Id: [0x001F5F6B]
It's too late, <i>mater</i>. I can't save him. He's made his choice.

Id: [0x001F5F6C]
The Cult of Kosmos never gave him one. We've thought him dead once, and you're choosing to kill him again.

Id: [0x001F5F6F]
I should go... Brasidas won't wait for long.

Id: [0x001F5F72]
You'll have your justice, puppet king.

Id: [0x001F5F7A]
Watch this.

Id: [0x001F5F7C]
Kassandra and Myrrine of Agiad: Your names are cursed. May the <i>krypteia</i> hunt you, and the helots scrape the meat from your bones.

Id: [0x001F5F83]
Someone also spoke very highly of you.

Id: [0x001F5F85]
Phoibe?

Id: [0x001F5F86]
Aspasia sent me! I work for her now, remember?

Id: [0x001F5F87]
And now Kassandra and I have met.

Id: [0x001F5F88]
See? This is easy! And now I can help you!

Id: [0x001F5F8B]
I should have been more certain before accusing Pausanias. He is a plague on Sparta and its territories.

Id: [0x001F5F8C]
And you say you're sure now? Where is he, so he can defend himself?

Id: [0x001F5F92]
You have a deal.

Id: [0x001F5F95]
As long as you deliver what I'm looking for, we won't have a problem.

Id: [0x001F5F9A]
Destroy a few ships from Sparta, a few from Athens, and a few bandit ones, too.

Id: [0x001F5F9B]
That's a lot of ship sinking.

Id: [0x001F5F9D]
Too bad you don't have a mask or a black cloak to save you this time.

Id: [0x001F5F9F]
You were there, in Delphi...

Id: [0x001F5FA1]
And a war.

Id: [0x001F5FA4]
Alone?

Id: [0x001F5FA9]
Stalkers in the night?

Id: [0x001F5FAA]
There's a reason Sparta never changes. It has rules, and they are strict. Spartans rule Lakonia, but most of its citizens are helots - enslaved peasants, made to work the fields and mines.

Id: [0x001F5FAB]
Slaves? Why don't they revolt?

Id: [0x001F5FAC]
Spartan fields keep them fed, and Spartan warriors keep them safe. First from the Persians, and now from the Athenians. When they forget their place, the <i>krypteia</i> are ordered to keep the peace.

Id: [0x001F5FAD]
Most of us make great sacrifices for comfort.

Id: [0x001F5FB1]
That training is ruthless.

Id: [0x001F5FB2]
Not ruthless. Effective. The best of those boys will become <i>krypteia</i> - keepers of the peace, and  stalkers in the night.

Id: [0x001F5FB7]
I see.

Id: [0x001F5FB8]
Most. Not all.

Id: [0x001F5FBD]
And your needs are greater than those of the man you helped ostracize? Still, you raise a fine point. Who is more responsible: Anaxagoras for getting himself mixed up in this, or you, for simply sealing his fate?

Id: [0x001F5FC0]
Fine. I'm more responsible. But I did it because I have one concern - myself.

Id: [0x001F5FC2]
I'm not responsible for his actions. I have one thing to think about - my own.

Id: [0x001F5FC5]
But why <i>here?</i> Korinth isn't safe.

Id: [0x001F5FC6]
I had to tell Anthousa you were coming! Aspasia taught me a new word: "emissary." That's me!

Id: [0x001F5FC8]
He told me a lot of things: Ikaros was once his, the doors to Atlantis need to be sealed, and something about mind-controlling artifacts... I think I left with more questions than answers.

Id: [0x001F5FC9]
Yes... he tends to have that effect on people.

Id: [0x001F5FCB]
When you and he... um[&groan], well, did you know he was over a hundred years old?

Id: [0x001F5FCC]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]He looked young for his age.

Id: [0x001F5FD0]
Now do you understand?

Id: [0x001F6110]
Dead. Chopped off his head if you'd like to see it.

Id: [0x001F6111]
And the Lykaon Wolf?

Id: [0x001F6113]
The <i>krypteia</i> represents Sparta's ultimate achievement in military training. Their discipline and fearlessness make Sparta's army the most feared in the world.

Id: [0x001F6115]
Once. But the <i>krypteia</i> have become corrupt and bloodthirsty. And training boys to kill unarmed peasants is nothing to be proud of.

Id: [0x001F6117]
Good.

Id: [0x001F611B]
Do you want your home back or not?

Id: [0x001F6120]
But lately these <i>krypteia</i> have been killing men, women, and children without reason or mercy. Babies ripped from their mothers and fed to the wolves... The <i>krypteia</i> have become a breeding ground for ruthless savages.

Id: [0x001F6121]
Patience, Archidamos.

Id: [0x001F6126]
I taught her poorly! Punish me, as her mother, instead.

Id: [0x001F6127]
We gave you every chance to prove yourself, invited you back for a royal audience, and this is how you repay us?

Id: [0x001F6128]
What say you, Archidamos?

Id: [0x001F6132]
Good, you're learning.

Id: [0x001F613C]
Herakles completed twelve. Two shouldn't be a problem.

Id: [0x001F6141]
[&laughs][chuckles][/&laughs]First Spartan thing you've said all day.

Id: [0x001F6142]
The Olympics will be starting soon in Elis, and our fighting champion requires an escort.

Id: [0x001F614F]
I'll be back, Ardos. Stay out of trouble.

Id: [0x001F6152]
Ha! He never answered me about my pater or the Minotaur, ever. That's why I left in the first place!

Id: [0x001F6161]
What have you done?! You killed my son!

Id: [0x001F616E]
The gods have sent you to help me, haven't they?

Id: [0x001F6185]
That was my wife! You're no <i>misthios</i>... you're a <i>monster</i>!

Id: [0x001F6186]
A <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001F6188]
This crime will not go unpunished. Tell me what you need.

Id: [0x001F6189]
Nemesis has heard my cries!

Id: [0x001F618B]
If you have drachmae, I may have a solution.

Id: [0x001F618C]
Of course. I never imagined divine intervention would come cheap.

Id: [0x001F618F]
My son was murdered at the murex warehouse, his head smashed in like an egg!

Id: [0x001F6195]
Your son's death will not go unpunished.

Id: [0x001F6196]
I have other things to attend to.

Id: [0x001F6197]
You would leave an old man without justice?

Id: [0x001F61A1]
I'll be with you soon. It's always a little better when you have to <i>wait</i>.

Id: [0x001F61A6]
Thank you for bringing back my husband.

Id: [0x001F61AB]
Secure Kythera for us, misthios.

Id: [0x001F61B0]
Now we can live free from fear. Thank you.

Id: [0x001F61B5]
Thank you for returning our ceremonial axe.

Id: [0x001F61BE]
I'm thinking my next masterpiece will be fang armor.

Id: [0x001F61C1]
What're you staring at <i>maláka</i>?

Id: [0x001F61C4]
I'm done with you. Get out of here.

Id: [0x001F61C9]
See? There's nothing better than bear fur against your skin. Mmm.

Id: [0x001F61CE]
Misthios! Remember me? You convinced me not to infiltrate the Daughters of Artemis. You saved my life, though -

Id: [0x001F61D1]
OH!

Id: [0x001F61D3]
You mean this old thing?

Id: [0x001F62E7]
What evidence do you have against Kythera's leader?

Id: [0x001F62EA]
Daughters?! I forbade him - told him the leader is a fearsome and vindictive man.

Id: [0x001F62F1]
Where is the warehouse located?

Id: [0x001F62F2]
At the end of the harbor. It's a bloody mess now...

Id: [0x001F62F8]
What makes you think he did it?

Id: [0x001F62F9]
I'll go to the warehouse and see what I can find.

Id: [0x001F62FA]
Find out who the murderer is, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F62FC]
What else did you need to know?

Id: [0x001F62FD]
<i>Misthios</i>, you must help me find my son's killer!

Id: [0x001F6302]
Not much blood, and his head was bashed in - probably a blunt weapon.

Id: [0x001F630F]
That must be the warehouse where the son died.

Id: [0x001F6310]
This bracelet looks expensive. They could be gifts from the daughters... or an attempt to frame Kythera's leader.

Id: [0x001F6311]
This must be the murder weapon. It's caked in dry blood - heavy too. There's no way the little guy could have swung this.

Id: [0x001F6313]
I don't think I'll find anything else useful in here.

Id: [0x001F6319]
I searched the warehouse and found a gold bracelet and a heavy stone tablet covered in blood.

Id: [0x001F6323]
See! I told you you'd find gifts from the leader's daughters.

Id: [0x001F6324]
If the fort leader is as strong as you say, only he could have lifted a tablet like the one I saw.

Id: [0x001F6325]
There's no way this scrawny thief could have swung it like a weapon.

Id: [0x001F6327]
Then kill Kythera's leader. You will be paid when he ceases to draw breath. And make it a <i>slow, painful</i> execution.

Id: [0x001F632C]
It will be done.

Id: [0x001F6330]
My son...

Id: [0x001F6367]
<i>Chaire</i>, soldier. How can I serve Sparta today?

Id: [0x001F6369]
Greetings, Spartan! Need something?

Id: [0x001F636B]
<i>Chaire</i>, soldier. Anything a mercenary can do for you today?

Id: [0x001F636D]
Commander. How can I serve Sparta today?

Id: [0x001F636F]
<i>Chaire</i>. Anything I can do to gain Sparta some ground, commander?

Id: [0x001F6388]
<i>Chaire</i>, soldier. How can I serve Athens today?

Id: [0x001F638A]
<i>Chaire</i>. Anything you need today, soldier?

Id: [0x001F638C]
What does Athens need done today, soldier?

Id: [0x001F638E]
Commander. Heard war efforts are bloody in these parts. Anything I can do to gain you more ground?

Id: [0x001F6390]
Commander. How can I serve Athens today?

Id: [0x001F63A9]
<i>Chaire</i>, friend. Anything a mercenary can do for you?

Id: [0x001F63AB]
Need something, stranger?

Id: [0x001F63AD]
Anything you need help with today?

Id: [0x001F63AF]
Need something?

Id: [0x001F63B1]
Is there something you need?

Id: [0x001F63CA]
<i>Chaire</i>, docker. Anything you need help with today?

Id: [0x001F63CC]
Anything a mercenary can do for you, docker?

Id: [0x001F63CE]
Can I help you with anything, docker?

Id: [0x001F63E6]
Your proof is right there. You know he’s guilty.

Id: [0x001F63ED]
There's a killer on the loose in a city with no morals to begin with. You can't just follow me around like in Kephallonia.

Id: [0x001F63EE]
The Monger, the Cyclops... I made it all the way here, didn't I?

Id: [0x001F63EF]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]Yes, you always find a way.

Id: [0x001F63F0]
You and I will talk about this later.

Id: [0x001F63F2]
I don't work for you - I work for Aspasia!

Id: [0x001F63F3]
Then the work<i> she</i> gave you should keep you busy.

Id: [0x001F63F4]
I guess that would be all right. Who knows what I'll get into?

Id: [0x001F63F5]
Yes!

Id: [0x001F63F6]
Just make sure you're extra careful.

Id: [0x001F6421]
It sounds like you've lost confidence in Sparta's warriors.

Id: [0x001F6422]
They're as strong as they've ever been. But now they're facing a power they can't even imagine.

Id: [0x001F6423]
Yes, that's what the rumors say. A force of nature in the body of a mortal, who can cut down any soldier in his path.

Id: [0x001F6424]
Do you mean Deimos?

Id: [0x001F6440]
But we're not here to talk about the dead. Are we?

Id: [0x001F6463]
[laughs]Good timing.

Id: [0x001F646F]
We're not strong enough - not yet. Have you helped the girls?

Id: [0x001F6476]
I heard. I also heard you had no problems dealing with them.

Id: [0x001F6485]
It wasn't my first fight in Korinth.

Id: [0x001F6500]
Who do you think took her?

Id: [0x001F6501]
It wouldn't be the first time the Monger's men came after one of us.

Id: [0x001F6506]
There! That's the boat our client described. Please, get her back safely.

Id: [0x001F650B]
By Aphrodite, Kleio better get back here soon.

Id: [0x001F6512]
Why call on the gods when you have one of their messengers at your service?

Id: [0x001F6514]
Maybe there's something a mercenary can do for you?

Id: [0x001F651A]
Kleio, one of our girls, didn't meet me for prayer this morning. She wasn't at home, either. I'd go investigate but I'm not sure what I could do on my own.

Id: [0x001F651B]
She might have been taken.

Id: [0x001F6521]
Stay back!

Id: [0x001F6522]
I'm here to rescue you.

Id: [0x001F6524]
Rescue me? You sunk my boat, pirate!

Id: [0x001F652B]
Put the knife away. I'm a friend.

Id: [0x001F652E]
Don't make me take that knife by force. [beat]I was sent here by a friend.

Id: [0x001F6532]
Your friend Erinna hired me to save you from these men and bring you back.

Id: [0x001F6533]
Erinna?! I commissioned that ship to steal me away from Korinth.

Id: [0x001F6539]
Erinna thought you were abducted. She clearly cares about you.

Id: [0x001F653A]
If she cared about me, she'd let me go. Even Anthousa can't keep us safe anymore.

Id: [0x001F653C]
The Greek world is being ravaged by war. You're no safer on the seas than you are in Korinth.

Id: [0x001F6542]
<i>Misthios</i>, please. We were heading to Mykonos, which <i>is</i> safe. If you'll take me there, I can pay you the toll I'd have paid my crew.

Id: [0x001F6547]
All right, [&breath]I'll[/&breath] get you there. Next time my crew docks at Mykonos, you can depart. In the meantime, welcome aboard.

Id: [0x001F654A]
Anthousa will take care of you. You need to go back to Korinth. It's your home.

Id: [0x001F654B]
Take me against my wishes, then. I won't fight you.

Id: [0x001F6553]
Kleio! [&ah]Did they hurt you? I prayed to Tyche for your safe return!

Id: [0x001F6554]
I'm fine, I'm fine.

Id: [0x001F6555]
There'd better not be a scratch on you. I promised this mercenary a month's salary to have you back in one piece.

Id: [0x001F6556]
You did?

Id: [0x001F6557]
Of course! You're my dear sister.

Id: [0x001F656C]
What happened? Where's Kleio?

Id: [0x001F6573]
Your friend is safe. That's what matters.

Id: [0x001F6576]
Your friend didn't need rescuing. She hired that ship to get out of Korinth and go somewhere safe.

Id: [0x001F6579]
So. She's really gone.

Id: [0x001F657A]
She's not coming back, no.

Id: [0x001F657B]
Thank you. [&breath]I'll let Anthousa know. Guess I'll be alone at prayer tomorrow. You promise she's safe?

Id: [0x001F6593]
I'm not the only one who needs help. My girls, Damalis and Erinna, are suffering too.

Id: [0x001F6594]
I'll see what I can do for them.

Id: [0x001F6607]
You'll be punished for what you've done.

Id: [0x001F6608]
I-I didn't murder your son! It wasn't me!

Id: [0x001F660B]
In the Hunted Forest of Artemis, north of Chios city.

Id: [0x001F660C]
It was Kythera's leader! I heard them arguing in the warehouse.

Id: [0x001F660D]
Then why didn't you stop them? You lie!

Id: [0x001F660F]
Go to the warehouse and find out who killed my son, <i>misthios</i>. Justice must be served.

Id: [0x001F6612]
Your son was fooling around with the leader's daughters - all four of them!

Id: [0x001F6614]
He was blinded by their riches - check the fort and you'll find the gifts they gave him!

Id: [0x001F661B]
It all happened so fast. We had a plan to break into the temple and corner it, but it ambushed us before we got inside. There was no time for strategy after that.

Id: [0x001F661E]
We took him in and gave him a job, but all he's done is steal from us. My boy fired him - kicked him out.

Id: [0x001F6623]
It wasn't chosen... It was earned.

Id: [0x001F6624]
I did steal, but I would never hurt someone.

Id: [0x001F6625]
You hurt him when you betrayed him, <i>maláka</i>!

Id: [0x001F6626]
That doesn't mean he killed him.

Id: [0x001F6628]
I'll make sure this <i>maláka</i> stays put.

Id: [0x001F6629]
I'm innocent. You'll see!

Id: [0x001F662D]
Tell me your secret, "Collector."

Id: [0x001F662F]
The armor of Theseus himself! It's the only thing that can withstand the beast. But it's not here, it's in the fort. I had to sell it!

Id: [0x001F6630]
I let him down... Thank you for clearing my name, <i>misthios</i>. Make sure he's avenged.

Id: [0x001F663A]
The boy! Thank the gods. Let's get out of here before they return.

Id: [0x001F663F]
But there's... a rumor he controls Heraklion from a hideout underground.

Id: [0x001F6640]
What did you find, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001F6641]
It's not proof of innocence. What's this about a stone tablet?

Id: [0x001F6642]
Tablet? I don't know of any tablet!

Id: [0x001F6643]
<i>Misthios</i>! Tell me who murdered my son - this worm or Kythera's leader?

Id: [0x001F664F]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>, for clearing my name.

Id: [0x001F66BB]
It was him.

Id: [0x001F66BC]
He probably stole the bracelet himself and planted it to frame Kythera's leader.

Id: [0x001F66BD]
No! That's not -

Id: [0x001F66BE]
I knew it! Kill him where he stands, <i>misthios</i>! I'll pay every last drachmae I have to watch the worm die.

Id: [0x001F66BF]
With pleasure.

Id: [0x001F66C0]
You're making a mistake!

Id: [0x001F66EA]
I'll consider it.

Id: [0x001F66EC]
Next time? Feel free to buy something.

Id: [0x001F66EF]
Problem solved.

Id: [0x001F66F0]
So it was him after all. I should have gutted him myself. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F66F3]
I've slain Kythera's leader. He was the one who murdered your son.

Id: [0x001F66F4]
Thank you for clearing my name, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F66F5]
And my boy can rest in peace.

Id: [0x001F66FA]
They both had a part in this.

Id: [0x001F66FB]
Then it's good you slew them both.

Id: [0x001F66FC]
My son has been avenged. Take your drachmae.

Id: [0x001F6721]
Wait.

Id: [0x001F6722]
But they won't speak to me!

Id: [0x001F672B]
<i>Hyah! Whish! Clang!</i>

Id: [0x001F672C]
You know, cross swords with him?

Id: [0x001F672E]
<i>Caaaaaan't</i> promise you that!

Id: [0x001F6748]
Calm down and tell me what's wrong.

Id: [0x001F6749]
My husband, he's late... no - missing! He and his friend have tracked a giant wolf south of Mytilene. They want its pelt.

Id: [0x001F675B]
He better be a good hunter.

Id: [0x001F675C]
Without knowing, all I can do is worry.

Id: [0x001F675E]
You said yourself he was likely late. I wouldn't worry.

Id: [0x001F675F]
But a savage creature could be devouring them as we speak!

Id: [0x001F6767]
I'll find your husband and kill the giant wolf once and for all.

Id: [0x001F6768]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. If there's anything I can do to help...

Id: [0x001F6772]
I have your bear skins.

Id: [0x001F6773]
Most impressive! Not many people have faced the majestic bear and lived to tell the tale... It's only fitting you receive a breastplate for your bravery.

Id: [0x001F6775]
I'm not ready to part with these skins.

Id: [0x001F6776]
Gorgeous ones like that - I can understand. But I'm in desperate need of skins of my own. Would you get more for me?

Id: [0x001F6779]
What makes you think it's not just an ordinary wolf?

Id: [0x001F677A]
My husband says it's twice the size as any he's seen!

Id: [0x001F677B]
Where south of Mytilene did he track the wolf to?

Id: [0x001F677C]
He tracked it southwest to the mountains and set up a lookout near a shrine[2446532].

Id: [0x001F677D]
I'll find your husband and his friend, and kill the giant wolf for you.

Id: [0x001F677E]
May Artemis guide your arrows.

Id: [0x001F6781]
If you wait a few days, I'm sure they'll show up.

Id: [0x001F6782]
That wolf is probably tearing the skin from his bones right now.

Id: [0x001F6786]
<i>Now</i> will you kill the giant wolf and find my husband?

Id: [0x001F6788]
Please, kill the giant wolf. My husband still hasn't returned.

Id: [0x001F67A5]
Who told you about the boy? Speak!

Id: [0x001F67B7]
Your face looks more sour than this fishy stink.

Id: [0x001F67B8]
Why shouldn't I be sour, eh? My no-good son sailed off with my boat and should've been back hours ago! Probably showing off for that Mytilene girl. Bah!

Id: [0x001F67BE]
The smell... Of course your son ran away. Doubt he'll come back.

Id: [0x001F67BF]
Choke on goat dung!

Id: [0x001F67C2]
He's probably just lost track of time. I'm sure he'll be back eventually.

Id: [0x001F67C3]
Of course he'll be back eventually - but I need him back now! These fish aren't going to skin themselves, you know.

Id: [0x001F67C5]
Say... Have you got time for an errand? Go look for my boy on the bay bordering the Petrified Valley and Ancient Pearl. And when you find him, scare him a bit to teach him a lesson. I'll pay you for it.

Id: [0x001F67CB]
I'll do it.

Id: [0x001F67CD]
Good. You find him, and <i>I'll</i> tan his hide.

Id: [0x001F67D0]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x001F67D1]
Then let's stop wasting each other's time, eh?

Id: [0x001F67D5]
Back to insult me some more?

Id: [0x001F67D7]
[&breath]Maybe we can help each other. My son's still not home. You find him, give him a scare, and I'll pay you. Fair wages for easy work, eh?

Id: [0x001F67D9]
What are you doing here? Go find my boy.

Id: [0x001F67E9]
Your son is dead, drowned in his fishing net.

Id: [0x001F67EA]
No! My boy... my poor boy. I pushed him too hard.

Id: [0x001F67F0]
Your son ran away with the girl. I found your boat abandoned on the opposite shore, and two sets of footprints pointing to Mytilene.

Id: [0x001F67F1]
But he's safe? Oh... Thank Poseidon.

Id: [0x001F67F3]
...Thank Poseidon for not robbing me of the chance of slapping some sense into that no-good boy.

Id: [0x001F6939]
What's going on?

Id: [0x001F693A]
I don't know what to do! My friend Galarnos was bringing me back a shipment of rare art, but he hasn't arrived. I fear the worst.

Id: [0x001F6941]
If you value your friend more than your drachmae, maybe you'd pay for his retrieval?

Id: [0x001F6942]
Of course I value Galarnos more than drachmae. I take it wealth is all <i>you</i> value, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001F6944]
Your friend might still be alive. Why not send out a search party?

Id: [0x001F6945]
Thank you stranger. I will hold on to hope as long as I can. Perhaps <i>you</i> have some experience finding things?

Id: [0x001F6947]
Depends where his ship was coming from.

Id: [0x001F6948]
It set sail from Makedonia. If you help find my friend, you can keep whatever art he was bringing back.

Id: [0x001F694E]
I can't promise anything - the sea is vast and hungry. I'll need some information to get started.

Id: [0x001F6954]
I won't comb the sea for one lost ship.

Id: [0x001F695A]
My lazy son is still missing. Maybe you'd be interested in finding him for pay.

Id: [0x001F695C]
I'll leave you with your heavy thoughts.

Id: [0x001F695D]
You're fighting the ghosts of your friends.

Id: [0x001F695F]
When fighting your own battles is all that's left, you are already lost.

Id: [0x001F6962]
He will die without help! I beg you to reconsider.

Id: [0x001F6964]
You came back! Galarnos and his ship are still missing. There's no time to waste.

Id: [0x001F6966]
Please keep looking for Galarnos and his missing ship. He must be out there.

Id: [0x001F6968]
Free at last!

Id: [0x001F6977]
A warrior <i>and</i> a sophist. This is a first.

Id: [0x001F6992]
No! I'm not giving up that easily. I have an idea.

Id: [0x001F6993]
What would you do?

Id: [0x001F6996]
Not yet.

Id: [0x001F6998]
Where should I start looking for "Swordfish"?

Id: [0x001F69A0]
If he's so dangerous, why are you talking to me?

Id: [0x001F69A1]
I'm old, tired - sick of bowin' down to pay "fees."

Id: [0x001F6DD5]
I have to go.

Id: [0x001F6DD7]
Watch over the boy, <i>misthios</i>. Do what I could not.

Id: [0x001F6DDB]
It's about adventure! Thrills! Danger!

Id: [0x001F6DE2]
This is my cave, and these are my riches. I'll kill you if you try and steal them.

Id: [0x001F6DE4]
Next thing you know, their dirty fingers are touching my riches! I'll kill anyone who touches them!

Id: [0x001F6DE5]
Can we not play games?

Id: [0x001F6DE6]
Fine. You're going to need Theseus's armor, which I sold to be part of a collection at the fort.

Id: [0x001F6DE9]
The beasts... The teeth... Too many teeth...

Id: [0x001F6DEE]
Why would stone need to be cured?

Id: [0x001F6DEF]
Surely you've seen their faces frozen in terror. They're not mere objects, but humans trapped in stone.

Id: [0x001F6DF1]
I'm not sure why it's happening. I'm merely a scholar looking for a cure - an elixir that will not only heal, but prevent this horrible affliction once and for all.

Id: [0x001F6DF8]
Something's turning people into stone, and you can make them flesh and blood again? Impressive.

Id: [0x001F6DF9]
Yes! Well... Not exactly. Not <i>yet</i>. It will be perfected through more trials.

Id: [0x001F6DFD]
[pause]But I only have one dose of elixir left. In order to make more I'd require a few ingredients, but I'm in no condition to gather them.

Id: [0x001F6E01]
The only thing less likely than those statues being people is you turning stone to flesh with an elixir.

Id: [0x001F6E02]
I didn't say I could revert the stone back to flesh!

Id: [0x001F6E04]
That is... not <i>yet</i>. This is an ongoing process, and more experiments are needed.

Id: [0x001F6E05]
How many more experiments?

Id: [0x001F6E06]
One never knows... But without the right ingredients, all my hard work will have been for naught.

Id: [0x001F6E09]
What do you need?

Id: [0x001F6E0A]
Just a few items found all over Vineyard Canyon. If you can get them for me, I'll reward you with a dose of my elixir.

Id: [0x001F6E10]
I'll gather what you need.

Id: [0x001F6E11]
Excellent. Now, listen closely to these ingredients: I require a cluster of bear dung  mushrooms, some cone snail bile, and a bouquet of hellebore.

Id: [0x001F6E18]
How did these statues come to be?

Id: [0x001F6E19]
I don't rightly know. A curse of the gods? The Writhing Dread? If you wish to see for yourself, You shouldn't do it without my elixir.

Id: [0x001F6E1A]
Rummaging around the forest doesn't interest me.

Id: [0x001F6E1B]
If you change your mind, look for me in my workshop on the east side of Mytilene, on the hill.

Id: [0x001F6E1D]
What is a hellebore?

Id: [0x001F6E1E]
Hellebore is a flowering plant you can find growing atop the highest mountain in Vineyard Canyon.

Id: [0x001F6E1F]
I'll go collect your ingredients.

Id: [0x001F6E20]
Come to my workshop on the hill east of Mytilene when you have everything.

Id: [0x001F6E29]
Come back if you ever want to sell them.

Id: [0x001F6E44]
I'll find your husband.

Id: [0x001F6E46]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Please don't let the pirates hurt him.

Id: [0x001F6E5B]
I have everything I need.

Id: [0x001F6E5C]
Then perhaps we'll celebrate our victory soon.

Id: [0x001F6E68]
I follow you, proudly.

Id: [0x001F6F24]
Do I know you?

Id: [0x001F6F95]
They couldn't make it any easier?

Id: [0x001F6FC9]
He's been killing hetaerae?

Id: [0x001F6FCA]
Killing? We're smarter than that. But action must be taken before it goes that far.

Id: [0x001F701A]
From what the worshippers say, he's someone I should watch out for.

Id: [0x001F701B]
They're right. I'm sure his victims wish they'd been more vigilant. <i>My</i> eyes are wide open.

Id: [0x001F70A7]
So you're here to help us, <i>misthios</i>? You don't <i>look </i>like a Monger spy.

Id: [0x001F70A8]
I'm more the in-your-face type. [beat]You have a Monger problem, Damalis?

Id: [0x001F70AB]
I might. One of my regulars has... changed. He was a decent man once, but now, he's gone bad.

Id: [0x001F70AD]
Korinth seems to have a shortage of "decent" people.

Id: [0x001F70B2]
Like he said, it's the thought that counts, right?

Id: [0x001F70B3]
Apparently. Come, the others are waiting.

Id: [0x001F70CC]
He's gotten you scared.

Id: [0x001F70CD]
He asks me questions I don't know the answers to about our drachmae. Where we keep money, what Anthousa invests in. As though we're Athenian aristocrats.

Id: [0x001F70D0]
Can't Anthousa intervene?

Id: [0x001F70D1]
I'm not naive! I won't expose the others to this. So he can go after them next?

Id: [0x001F70D9]
But his inspiration lives on - that's why we're here.

Id: [0x001F70DA]
And get back to what <i>truly</i> matters -

Id: [0x001F70DB]
- To restore Athens to its former glory.

Id: [0x001F70E3]
It will. People tend to show their true selves to my spear whether they like it or not.

Id: [0x001F70EF]
I need to ask more about this client of yours.

Id: [0x001F70F1]
I'll go find him.

Id: [0x001F70F7]
Good, you found me!

Id: [0x001F7106]
Quiet like a mouse!

Id: [0x001F7107]
Good. But if you get caught, run. Right out the door. We'll meet afterwards. Promise?

Id: [0x001F7108]
I'm ready. Let's go!

Id: [0x001F710A]
We can't just sit around. Kleon is sending a boat to Mytilene to kill the people there.

Id: [0x001F710D]
The people trust Kleon. They'll vote for whatever action he puts forth.

Id: [0x001F7110]
But that does not mean we plan to do nothing.

Id: [0x001F7134]
<i>Shh!</i> What are you doing here?

Id: [0x001F7135]
I heard Damalis talking about her crazy client earlier and I wanted to help!

Id: [0x001F713C]
Fine. But you have to do as I say. No games!

Id: [0x001F713D]
I know that already - because you never let me have any fun!

Id: [0x001F713F]
You may be right. I could use you.

Id: [0x001F7140]
See? That was my plan all along!

Id: [0x001F7145]
Time to act. Listen closely. You sneak inside and see what you can find in his house while I distract him.

Id: [0x001F714A]
No. But I know you.

Id: [0x001F714B]
If Myron sent you, tell him I was going to pay him back this very night!

Id: [0x001F7162]
Wait! Thief! Thieves!

Id: [0x001F7164]
Get out! Guards! Get them!

Id: [0x001F7189]
Do you have the treasure?

Id: [0x001F718A]
No, but I have questions.

Id: [0x001F719D]
What does this mean?

Id: [0x001F719E]
It means the Monger got to him. He <i>does</i> have his hand in everything.

Id: [0x001F719F]
At least I know how to deal with him now that I know what he's after.

You won't have to. I took care of him myself.

Id: [0x001F71CD]
The Monger's the real fool. He'll find that out soon enough.

Id: [0x001F71CF]
He'll leave you alone now. He gave me his word.

Id: [0x001F71D0]
So we really <i>can </i>trust you, can't we?

Id: [0x001F71D1]
We're not all so easily blackmailed.

Id: [0x001F71D3]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]It had to come to this. Maláka, what a fool he was.

Id: [0x001F71D6]
Well look who came crawling back. Have you reconsidered my offer?

Id: [0x001F71DC]
I can't make a name for myself fishing for fabled treasure.

Id: [0x001F71DE]
I might be interested in an adventure.

Id: [0x001F71E6]
All right, I suppose I can help you recover your treasure.

Id: [0x001F71E9]
Diving into shark-infested ruins isn't really my thing. I think I'll pass.

Id: [0x001F71F2]
How will I know if I'm looking in the right place?

Id: [0x001F71F3]
Head south from the Lost Garden of Bacchylides. Even though the ruins are underwater, you'll see them just off the coast.

Id: [0x001F71F4]
What's it like down there?

Id: [0x001F71F5]
The treasure is guarded by a frenzy of sharks. You'll find it in a chest at the heart of the island.

Id: [0x001F71F6]
What exactly is this treasure?

Id: [0x001F71F7]
It's said to be in the Ancient Ruins of Kunastros, so the treasure must be a rare artifact from before the island was settled.

Id: [0x001F71F8]
I'll get you what you want.

Id: [0x001F72C2]
I'll get them for you.

Id: [0x001F72C3]
Thank you, misthios.

Healer... Could you use the skills of a mercenary?

Need help with anything, healer?

Hello, stranger. Need help with anything?

Id: [0x001F79BC]
Is there anything you need a mercenary for today, friend?

Id: [0x001F79C4]
<i>Chaire</i>, hunter. Finding much game in these parts?

Id: [0x001F79C9]
Hello, there. How goes the hunting?

Id: [0x001F79CE]
Caught anything, hunter?

Id: [0x001F79F3]
My thanks. If you're willing to grant me another favor, I could use your help.

Id: [0x001F79F7]
Thank you. I needed the help - could use more, too, if you're interested.

Id: [0x001F7A00]
Thanks for that. I don't suppose you're looking for a job?

Id: [0x001F7A04]
Not many people would have helped me there. Actually, I've been looking for someone just like you. Interested?

Id: [0x001F7A0E]
Freedom! Thank you. I hesitate to ask but - I could use more help.

Id: [0x001F7A13]
I thought I'd die a prisoner. But now that I'm free, I could use your help again, if you're willing?

Id: [0x001F7AD6]
You're back. Did you change your mind?

Id: [0x001F7ADB]
Please say you'll help!

Id: [0x001F7AE0]
Can you help me after all?

Id: [0x001F7AE5]
You! Did you reconsider?

Id: [0x001F7AEA]
I still need help, if you're able.

Id: [0x001F7B7B]
No chance you're from the encampment, are you? Have you heard about the poisons?

Id: [0x001F7B83]
You seem like someone with good connections in the military. I have services to offer.

Id: [0x001F7B87]
I'm in a bind. Part of my profession means studying the human body. But to do that I need... specimens.

Id: [0x001F7B8B]
I sold some poison to those soldiers. I thought they were going to use it on arrows, but they're going to dump it in the water supply!

Id: [0x001F7B8F]
I'm trying to study the animals living around here. But the humans keep ruining everything.

Id: [0x001F7B97]
My armillary sphere's been stolen, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x001F7B9B]
I've been trying to research the stars, but those Followers of Ares say I'm working against the gods. They're threatening to kill me!

Id: [0x001F7B9F]
I think they're trying to kill me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F7BA3]
I've been doing the calculations for weeks. There's an earthquake coming.

Id: [0x001F7BA7]
Maybe you could help a poor apothecary with a business proposition? The other apothecaries are outselling me!

Id: [0x001F7BAB]
<i>Misthios</i>, there's a cult nearby that is spewing some dangerous nonsense.

Id: [0x001F7BAF]
This weather, <i>misthios</i>. We've had rain every day this month. And the wind! Ships can't get into the harbors. Farmers can't plant in their fields.

Id: [0x001F7BB3]
The Followers of Ares were just here. They took my scientific notes. My life's work!

Id: [0x001F7BB7]
I've been studying war tactics and training for the Athenians. But the Spartans want my research. They've sent spies to steal it.

Id: [0x001F7BBB]
I overheard one of the Spartan commanders talking this morning. He said they needed more slaves to work in their camp. I'm afraid he means me!

Id: [0x001F7BBF]
This war, <i>misthios</i>. It feels like the end of the world. I don't see how we can keep going if these battles destroy whole villages.

Id: [0x001F7BC3]
I'm sure you've heard about that nation leader who died.

Id: [0x001F7BDD]
I've been looking for someone who can move silently through the woods. I hear you have the skill for it.

Id: [0x001F7BE1]
I've made a deal with one of the merchants in town. I provide wolf pelts, and he pays well.

Id: [0x001F7BE5]
They say you're touched by the gods! A descendant of Leonidas! You're exactly what I need right now.

Id: [0x001F7BE9]
They say you know lawmakers. Politicians. Is that true?

Id: [0x001F7BED]
That <i>malákas</i> Petron is stealing my catch right out of the traps again. Last time I made him pay me. This time, I'm having trouble getting him to pay up.

Id: [0x001F7BF1]
My family has been hunting this area for generations. Now this <i>maláka</i> - calls himself  Pelor - has moved in. He's got traps everywhere. There's hardly any game left because of him.

Id: [0x001F7BF5]
I heard you have some skill with a bow. Is that true?

Id: [0x001F7BF9]
They say you've been "dealing with" all the soldiers around here. That true?

Id: [0x001F7BFD]
Bandits set up a camp near my home. They said the land was theirs, and when I tried to hunt, they said I was poaching.

Id: [0x001F7CA2]
Thank you. You'll be well rewarded.

Id: [0x001F7CA6]
Thank you. You've saved me.

Id: [0x001F7CAA]
My thanks, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001F7E93]
An opportunity to help more people? Yes, I'd love to.

Id: [0x001F7E97]
I'm happy to do the work of the Asclepius wherever I can. I'll join you.

Id: [0x001F7E9B]
If you're looking for a healer, then yes. I'll join you.

Id: [0x001F7EA2]
Oh, traveling the Aegean is my dream. I would love to!

Id: [0x001F7EA6]
This seems steadier work than measuring the spheres or gathering herbs. Of course I'll join you.

Id: [0x001F7EAA]
I hadn't ever thought of a life at sea but... Yes, I accept.

Id: [0x001F7EB1]
Hunting exotic beasts across the Greek world? I'm in.

Id: [0x001F7EB5]
Never considered myself a seaman... But an adventurer? [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x001F7EB9]
If you're patient, I'll earn my sea legs in time.

Id: [0x001F7EC6]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. But too many people need me here.

Id: [0x001F7ECA]
No, more people need my help on land than at sea.

Id: [0x001F7ECE]
Well! I didn't expect that. But I have too much to do here.

Id: [0x001F7ED5]
Thanks for the offer, but I can't leave my work here.

Id: [0x001F7ED9]
I've built a life here. While I appreciate your offer... I need to stay.

Id: [0x001F7EDD]
As grateful as I am for your help... no. I'm sorry. I'll keep my feet on land.

Id: [0x001F7EE4]
I'm a hunter, not a fisher. My prey is on land.

Id: [0x001F7EE8]
I'm no sailor. My feet belong on land.

Id: [0x001F7EEC]
Thanks for the offer, <i>misthios</i>, but my prey has feet, not fins.

Id: [0x001F7F0E]
Well, I hope you don't expect payment for this.

Id: [0x001F7F11]
I trusted you to do this for me! Just... go.

Id: [0x001F7F14]
Well. I suppose I shouldn't have expected anything else.

Id: [0x001F7F17]
Why did I let myself think you could help me?

Id: [0x001F7F26]
I'll be here if you change your mind!

Id: [0x001F7F2A]
Well. What do I do now?

Id: [0x001F7F2E]
No one will help me!

Id: [0x001FD1B0]
Let's see what we found.

Id: [0x001FD1B1]
I wonder what this means?

Id: [0x001FD1B7]
Did you ask him to pay you for this delivery?

Id: [0x001FD1CD]
No, I knew this would help you and your patients. That's good enough for me.

Id: [0x001FD1CE]
Quite admirable. What did you say your name was?

Id: [0x001FD1D2]
My friend, you are a gift from Poseidon himself.

Id: [0x001FD1D3]
I try my best.

Id: [0x001FD1D4]
I'm going to need that artifact from you now.

Id: [0x001FD1D5]
First, my pay.

Id: [0x001FD1D6]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x001FD1DC]
Very funny. Now pay up.

Id: [0x001FD1DD]
The last laugh is all mine... I'm in the business of double crossing mercenaries.

Id: [0x001FD1DE]
I didn't swim through sharks for this.

Id: [0x001FD1DF]
That was your mistake, not mine.

Id: [0x001FD1E1]
You fucking traitor.

Id: [0x001FD1E2]
Now, now. Let's not make it personal.

Id: [0x001FD1E3]
I do your dirty work, and you don't pay me? It's personal.

Id: [0x001FD1E4]
Look on the bright side - I'm allowing you to walk away with your life.

Id: [0x001FD1FF]
Deal's off. Now I'll kill you for wasting my time.

Id: [0x001FD200]
You haven't got a chance. Take her out!

Id: [0x001FD202]
There was no treasure.

Id: [0x001FD203]
Then why are you here?

Id: [0x001FD204]
I came to tell you there's nothing down there. Someone else must have got there first.

Id: [0x001FD205]
Then I'll kill you and check your remains, just to be sure.

Id: [0x001FD207]
Here's your treasure. I hope it's cursed.

Id: [0x001FD208]
I could tell you were a smart one.

Id: [0x001FD20A]
Satisfied?

Id: [0x001FD20B]
Yes. Now get off my fucking ship.

Id: [0x001FD216]
Good. The Monger feeds his thugs with the drachmae he makes smuggling - weapons mostly, which is all the more lucrative now that he has a war to supply.

Id: [0x001FD219]
Of course I did. I'm a <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001FD21A]
Ungenerous, but honest at least. What can I call you, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001FD259]
So if someone interrupts the Monger's supply, his men go hungry.

Id: [0x001FD266]
Please, leave us!

Id: [0x001FD283]
Gods have mercy!

Id: [0x001FD286]
You - want - <i>mercy</i>?

Id: [0x001FD289]
What does the letter say?

Id: [0x001FD28A]
What's this, a coin purse?

Id: [0x001FD28B]
His things aren't very nice, though. If he's rich, why have all that junk?

Id: [0x001FD28C]
He must have just gotten paid.

Id: [0x001FD2B7]
It's mean! It says he'll get hurt if he keeps doing things wrong.

Id: [0x001FD2B8]
It's not used for fire... it's a weapon. For torture. I saw someone use it in Phokis. Someone huge.

Id: [0x001FD2B9]
He didn't have a furnace! Why does he have this?

Id: [0x001FD2BA]
Those who trade in slaves anywhere on <i>my</i> island will be marked as slaves themselves...

Id: [0x001FD2BC]
...Then hauled to Attika and fed to the system they tried to profit from.

Id: [0x001FD2BE]
Get this scum out of my sight.

Id: [0x001FD2C6]
The mighty not-Spartan returns!

Id: [0x001FD2C8]
My name is Kassandra.

Id: [0x001FD2C9]
Well, Kassandra, we're all thought to be murderers too. So, tell me why I shouldn't kill you right here.

Id: [0x001FD2E5]
I thought all pirates were slavers.

Id: [0x001FD2E8]
And you are?

Id: [0x001FD2E9]
I was told you're a trader of information.

Id: [0x001FD2EA]
[&laughs]Among other things, yes.

Id: [0x001FD2EB]
I'm looking for someone.

Id: [0x001FD2ED]
I came to find the great pirate Xenia. That's you, isn't it?

Id: [0x001FD2EE]
I like the sound of that, but what was your plan once you found me?

Id: [0x001FD2EF]
I came to offer you a deal.

Id: [0x001FD2F2]
I butchered several of your "men" to get here. What makes you think you'd fare any better?

Id: [0x001FD2F4]
You <i>are</i> a bold one. I like that, but don't think your words scare me, girl. There's a fine line between confidence and disrespect.

Id: [0x001FD2F6]
Lucky for both of us, I didn't come looking for a fight.

Id: [0x001FD2FA]
Entering my city and killing my followers is a strange way to strike a deal.

Id: [0x001FD2FB]
I didn't think they'd let me just walk in, and I don't have time to waste.

Id: [0x001FD2FF]
Sneaking into my city is a strange way to make a first impression.

Id: [0x001FD300]
I needed to speak with you directly. I didn't think your pirates would just let me walk up and knock.

Id: [0x001FD304]
Then speak.

Id: [0x001FD305]
I'm looking for a woman. She left Sparta when I was a child.

Id: [0x001FD306]
I'll need more than that, Kassandra.

Id: [0x001FD32A]
I'm going, I'm going. Even though I know I could help.

Id: [0x001FD32D]
What kind of equipment?

Id: [0x001FD32E]
Just medical necessities. Knives and gut for sutures, bandages... Oh, and an enema bag for clearing the bowels.

Id: [0x001FD32F]
That had better be properly wrapped.

Id: [0x001FD906]
I'm sorry, I can't help you further. You need to speak with Hippokrates.

Id: [0x001FD912]
Enemas are a key element of maintaining the balance of the humors. You should consider them as part of your bathing routine.

Id: [0x001FD91E]
I should go buy more vinegar. You can never have too many emetics!

Id: [0x001FE4C0]
As did this patient, and the one before him, and the one before her.

Id: [0x001FE4C2]
My patients need me, but my notes on diseases of the mind were taken. Retrieve them, and I will help you find what you seek.

Id: [0x001FE4C3]
Ah, you've met the priestess. No, not her, but the local military commander. I can't fault his desperation. Those men suffer terribly from battle fatigue.

Id: [0x001FE4C5]
Please, Hippokrates. I came very far to meet you.

Id: [0x001FEB04]
Maláka...

Id: [0x001FEB0D]
That doesn't look good for you. You'll need to apologize somehow - or get out of town.

Id: [0x001FEB0E]
I do need to show them I'm useful. Write them a letter, or give them some sort of gift. While remaining at a safe distance, that is.

Id: [0x001FEB14]
You have to heal who the gods put in your path, but <i>they</i> might not see it that way.

Id: [0x001FEB15]
My thoughts exactly! I need to find a way to show them I'm a neutral party. Give them some sort of gift! While remaining at a safe distance, that is.

Id: [0x001FEB1F]
I've been up pacing all night. This change in leadership... A physician shouldn't have to worry about politics.

Id: [0x001FEB20]
Then why are you worried?

Id: [0x001FEB21]
I may have tried to heal a few people who were opposed to our new leadership... Just doing my job, you understand!

Id: [0x001FEB25]
They've sworn they'll kill me if I leave.

Id: [0x001FEB26]
Who?

Id: [0x001FEB27]
The officers! They say they need physicians to help their soldiers. They kidnapped me. Please, you have to help me. I want to get out of this war.

Id: [0x001FEB2D]
I tried a new medical procedure on one of my patients. It was a success! Now he swears he got better on his own and won't pay me.

Id: [0x001FEB31]
No one should die because they're too poor to afford a doctor.

Id: [0x001FEB32]
Exactly. But we need money for supplies, medicine. I'd start by asking politicians, leaders, and the like. Or maybe a letter would be better. More official.

Id: [0x001FEB36]
If you're so concerned, don't charge people for healing. I pay for my own treatment <i>if</i> I need it.

Id: [0x001FEB37]
Oh, I wouldn't ask for money from someone lower-class like yourself. I'd have to ask politicians. High-ranking military officers. I can write a letter to them, if it's easier.

Id: [0x001FEB40]
The way the poor are treated in this city is terrible. They're left to sicken and die in the streets. The wealthy should be paying for them to see a physician!

Id: [0x001FEB43]
If you've been hunting around here, please don't eat the animals you kill.

Id: [0x001FEB44]
All right. Why not?

Id: [0x001FEB45]
They're diseased. Half the countryside is sick from eating spoiled meat.

Id: [0x001FEB46]
They should know better than to eat it.

Id: [0x001FEB47]
Maybe so, but people here don't have anything else. Either someone needs to take them food, or those animals need to go.

Id: [0x001FEB4B]
The aftermath of battle is never pretty. What do you need?

Id: [0x001FEB4C]
Bandages. Medicine... Which the soldiers are hoarding in their camps, I might add. Oh, and someone to deliver what I already have.

Id: [0x001FEB50]
If you hate war so much, you shouldn't make a living off of the injured.

Id: [0x001FEB51]
Well, I can't help anyone right now, can I? I can't get the supplies I need with the soldiers around here hoarding them all - let alone take them to the people who could use them.

Id: [0x001FEB59]
You and your fellow soldiers have done your work well. There are so many injured around here, I can't hope to get to them all.

Id: [0x001FEB5E]
If you can use those weapons, I'd be grateful for your help.

Id: [0x001FEB5F]
Why would a healer need weapons?

Id: [0x001FEB60]
I can't heal if I'm killed before I get to my patients. Between the bandits and the animals running wild, the roads just aren't safe.

Id: [0x001FEB64]
I have so many soldiers asking for blessing cloths, but the roads are so dangerous, I can't possibly deliver them.

Id: [0x001FEB65]
Blessing cloths?

Id: [0x001FEB66]
I write out the blessings of the Gods, and you wear them next to your skin to protect yourself in battle. I'm surprised you don't carry one yourself.

Id: [0x001FEB67]
Anyway, if the roads weren't overrun with bandits, I could get these to the people who wanted them. I need the money - but I don't want to risk my own neck.

Id: [0x001FEB77]
I'm sure there will be peace, soon.

Id: [0x001FEB79]
There will be no end unless someone does something about it! Look - there must be some way to at least get them away from here. Take their food. Weapons. Boats, even. I'll pay you.

Id: [0x001FEB7E]
I don't think either side has had its fill of blood yet.

Id: [0x001FEB7F]
Please, I know you're a warrior yourself, but maybe you could find a way to drive them away from here, at least? If they had less food or weapons maybe? Boats, even.

Id: [0x001FEB8A]
I lost another three patients this morning. A family. They got caught between a group of Athenians and Spartans. This war needs to end.

Id: [0x001FEB8D]
I've got a love philter here that needs to be delivered to a Spartan commander, but my usual messenger broke his ankle. I'll lose my fee if this doesn't arrive safely!

Id: [0x001FEB96]
I'm so tired. There just aren't enough people to heal the sick in this area. I sent for another physician weeks ago, but she hasn't arrived yet.

Id: [0x001FEB97]
What happened to her?

Id: [0x001FEB98]
I don't know. The roads are dangerous - soldiers and bandits everywhere. She could have been waylaid, or she doesn't feel safe traveling in the first place.

Id: [0x001FEB9D]
Someone needs to stop those cursed soldiers. They've started dipping their arrows in the blood of plague victims. One person gets injured, and then everyone falls sick around them!

Id: [0x001FEBA0]
If you've got the drachmae, I'll listen.

Id: [0x001FEBA3]
I don't usually turn my back on the sick.

Id: [0x001FEBAA]
I have a lot of sick patients, and no medicine to give them. Normally I wouldn't bother someone of your... occupation, but... I'm desperate.

Id: [0x001FEBAE]
I've been robbed. Those thieves have taken my medical bag and everything that was in it! My sapphire! My carnelian!

Id: [0x001FEBAF]
Did you lose jewelry or medicine?

Id: [0x001FEBB0]
Oh, very funny! I use those stones in my healing. What am I supposed to do without them?

Id: [0x001FEBB3]
Physicians heal the sick. They shouldn't fault you for that.

Id: [0x001FEBB4]
That's what I think, too! But there's no convincing the Athenians of that if they want me dead.

Id: [0x001FEBB7]
I'm not sure what you expected, taking sides in a war.

Id: [0x001FEBB8]
What was I supposed to do? If someone's injured, I have to help them. I'd do the same no matter which side they were on. You have to help me.

Id: [0x001FEBBF]
The Athenians found out I've been healing Spartan soldiers. I think they want to kill me.

Id: [0x001FEBC3]
Then you'll have to fight them.

Id: [0x001FEBC4]
What, me? I can barely hold a blade, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001FEBC7]
So run. Get away before they get here.

Id: [0x001FEBC8]
Some of my patients are too injured to move. I won't abandon them.

Id: [0x001FEBCF]
The Athenian army's been bringing their soldiers here lately. I've been bandaging their wounds.

Id: [0x001FEBD2]
If it's purification you want, why not just have them pray somewhere nearby?

Id: [0x001FEBD6]
Perhaps rest would do them more good than wandering through the wilderness.

Id: [0x001FEBD7]
Well, it's clear you don't understand anything about problems of the spirit. The problem isn't the walking! It's the wild animals.

Id: [0x001FEBE0]
Those beasts in the woods are hurting my patients! They're coming back more injured than I sent them off - when they come back at all.

Id: [0x001FEBE1]
Why are you sending patients into the woods?

Id: [0x001FEBE2]
To purify themselves, of course. They walk from here to the shrine at night. It eases their pain. Soothes their souls. What else would they do to get better?

Id: [0x001FEBE6]
These are dark times, <i>misthios</i>. People are just dropping dead - I can't help them all.

Id: [0x001FEBE7]
The plague?

Id: [0x001FEBE8]
Thankfully, no. Mostly they need food. There's a group of bandits robbing the farmers, then selling the food back to anyone who can pay their rates.

Id: [0x001FEBEF]
I'm not sure I have much say in the gods' business.

Id: [0x001FEBF3]
Well, I might have some sway with the gods.

Id: [0x001FEBFD]
One of my patients has lost all favor with the gods. I need help lifting the curse that's been placed on her.

Id: [0x001FEC00]
So, what has caused this man's condition?

Id: [0x001FEC01]
An excess of phlegm, doctor.

Id: [0x001FEC02]
In the immediate sense, yes. But more importantly, he suffers from neglect.

Id: [0x001FEC04]
Challenging tradition... You must be Hippokrates.

Id: [0x001FEC05]
Yes. I'm also very busy.

Id: [0x001FEC1E]
Neglect?

Id: [0x001FEC1F]
Good food, warm clothing, so much could have helped. But since other "caretakers" assumed his condition was a punishment from the gods, they neglected him.

Id: [0x001FEC35]
You know her?

Id: [0x001FEC68]
She's my mother. I haven't seen her since I was a child.

Id: [0x001FEC6A]
So, you're on a quest to find your family.

Id: [0x001FEC6B]
Something like that.

Id: [0x001FEC6C]
Then your path is not an easy one.

Id: [0x001FEC71]
It doesn't matter who she is to me.

Id: [0x001FEC73]
Maybe not.

Id: [0x001FEC75]
She's a criminal who fled Sparta many years ago. I was hired to bring her back.

Id: [0x001FEC77]
I see. So, she's dangerous?

Id: [0x001FEC78]
To you, I don't think anyone is dangerous.

Id: [0x001FEC79]
If only that were true.

Id: [0x001FEC80]
The thieves are better off robbin' <i>them</i> than us.

Id: [0x001FEC87]
Not unless the gods heed our prayers. Many sick Athenians have arrived in Argolis recently, and very few have left. This poor girl has the same sickness.

Id: [0x001FEC8A]
We’re wasting time, priest. We can discuss what I want when this sick girl’s needs are taken care of.

Id: [0x001FEC8D]
Her illness seems to have no cure, and it's spreading. Our sacrifices have done little to draw the attention of the gods. Pigs, goats - all have fallen on deaf ears. We need a beast whose blood will ignite these flames for Asklepios to see.

Id: [0x001FEC8E]
What did you have in mind?

Id: [0x001FEC8F]
There is rumor of a bull with skin as white as snow roaming the sanctuary outskirts. Head west of here towards the coast. Bring it to me alive, and we'll offer a sacrifice the gods cannot ignore.

Id: [0x001FEC92]
So he's hunting the hetaerae. For money?

Id: [0x001FEC93]
Exactly. Since the hetaerae bring in so much drachmae, he wants everything they control!

Id: [0x001FECB8]
Fort Tiryns, not far from here. Perhaps they'll return them if you ask.

Id: [0x001FECBA]
I'll do my best with what you've told me.

Id: [0x001FECC6]
I -

Id: [0x001FECD6]
I was warned about an Eagle Bearer. "A ruthless killer," she was called.

Id: [0x001FECD7]
Do you think it's wise to deny a "ruthless killer" the information she desires?

Id: [0x001FECD8]
[&breath][sighs][/&breath]Healing the sick is my path. Help me get the attention of the gods, and I'll tell you what I can.

Id: [0x001FECDB]
Where should I look for your notes?

Id: [0x001FECE5]
Or they could prepare for a new battle, with me.

Id: [0x001FECE6]
Far be it from me to tell a <i>misthios</i> how to work, but please, for my sake, do not kill needlessly. Enough blood has been shed in this war.

Id: [0x001FECE7]
Good luck. We're depending on you.

Id: [0x001FECED]
Aspasia? Now why would she do that?

Id: [0x001FECEE]
She said you might have information that could help me in my search.

Id: [0x001FECF1]
You can have anything for the right price.

Id: [0x001FECF9]
I have patients to treat, <i>misthios</i>. Please make this quick.

Id: [0x001FED01]
The father of medicine. That bald spot - like a beacon of hope for all who seek him!

Id: [0x001FED0F]
Is that the <i>real</i> Hippokrates? I heard he can raise the dead!

Id: [0x001FED1D]
Hippokrates is here. Bless the gods. He'll be able to stop this pain.

Id: [0x001FED21]
What are you asking exactly?

Id: [0x001FED2B]
You let me know if you find those girls! They have to be <i>somewhere </i>in this city.

Id: [0x001FED31]
And what is that price?

Id: [0x001FED37]
Considering you butchered a few of my people, I feel like compensation is in order.

Id: [0x001FED3D]
One you can afford, I'm sure.

Id: [0x001FED47]
Here, take it.

Id: [0x001FED49]
A pleasure doing business.

Id: [0x001FED4B]
Why do you need so much drachmae?

Id: [0x001FED4C]
I have a city to secure and people to protect. I have no interest in going to war - I just want to make sure the war doesn't come to us.

Id: [0x001FED4F]
I don't have that kind of drachmae.

Id: [0x001FED50]
I find that surprising, given your profession.

Id: [0x001FED51]
What proof do I have that you'll even find her?

Id: [0x001FED52]
I already know Myrrine.

Id: [0x001FED53]
How do you know that name?

Id: [0x001FED54]
That's not all I know.

Id: [0x001FED55]
Getting that much drachmae won't be easy.

Id: [0x001FED56]
You have a ship and a crew. That's enough to find work here in Koressia. [beat]And there's a stockpile of drachmae held in the fort on the far side of the island.

Id: [0x001FED58]
Don't worry. As long as you're working for me, you're one of us.

Id: [0x001FED5B]
You want me to steal from your island?

Id: [0x001FED5C]
The other locals aren't too happy about us pirates. Their leader has amassed a fortune. If they have no drachmae, they can't do anything stupid.

Id: [0x001FED5E]
Here, take your drachmae.

Id: [0x001FED60]
Nothing feels better than a heavy purse filled with coin.

Id: [0x001FED62]
The information I need, how long will it take?

Id: [0x001FED63]
I already have it.

Id: [0x001FED64]
You do?

Id: [0x001FED65]
Your "Myrrine" now sails under the name of Phoenix. She started as a member of my crew, but we parted ways not too long ago.

Id: [0x001FED66]
Do you know where she is now?

Id: [0x001FED67]
She sailed southeast with her crew in search of a greater calling.

Id: [0x001FED87]
There's no rush on my part. If you need work, check with my people in the city. I'm sure they'd have use for a capable mercenary.

Id: [0x001FED89]
I don't have the drachmae yet, but I'll return when I do.

Id: [0x001FEE45]
Something we can help you with?

Id: [0x001FEE46]
Yeah, you were talking about a shipment.

Id: [0x001FEE47]
We weren't saying nothing... Nothing that concerns you, anyway.

Id: [0x001FEE51]
Well, you know why. Shame though, all that cargo out there on the ocean...

Id: [0x001FEE5A]
Can you fucking believe it?

Id: [0x001FEE5B]
Thought she'd know better by now.

Id: [0x001FEE5F]
Still, Xenia could've used that <i>miltos</i>. The drachmae would have been helpful in her fight against...

Id: [0x001FEE61]
You were, and I want to know more.

Id: [0x001FEE69]
And I heard she left Sparta that night. No one has forgotten Myrrine.

Id: [0x001FEEC5]
I'm touched you would help these people. But I know why you're really here.

Id: [0x001FEECB]
Please hurry and find the white bull, these people don't have much time.

Id: [0x001FEECD]
Yes!

Id: [0x001FEECE]
Sparta is the enemy!

Id: [0x001FEECF]
You are one, we are many!

Id: [0x001FEEDE]
No one sent me. [beat]We need to talk. I know you're up to something -

Id: [0x001FEEDF]
Something? Something could be anything! You have nothing on me.

Id: [0x001FEEE2]
Did you find the white bull?

Id: [0x001FEEF1]
Theseus's armor. It <i>is</i> real.

Id: [0x001FEEF3]
Yeah, don't really care what you want.

Id: [0x001FEEFD]
Don't even try it. We're under Xenia's protection here, like everyone else.

Id: [0x001FEEFE]
Go on, get out of here.

Id: [0x001FEEFF]
You'd better tell me about that <i>miltos</i> shipment.

Id: [0x001FEF00]
Don't have to tell you shit.

Id: [0x001FEF19]
Chrysis made all priests swear oaths to seal our lips in the face of the eagle-bearing <i>misthios, </i>or forfeit our lives<i>.</i>

Id: [0x001FEF1B]
But I serve the gods and the sick. My oaths are to them.

Id: [0x001FEF2B]
This must be the place described in the letter. Anybody home?

Id: [0x001FEF3D]
With the drachmae I'm offering, you can buy any name you want.

Id: [0x001FEF3E]
I can promise you this will be one to remember, else Poseidon's trident spear me and drag me to the crushing deep.

Id: [0x001FEF43]
I mean how hard is it to take a merchant ship and get to Thera and back?!

Id: [0x001FEF62]
I thought as much.

Id: [0x001FEF63]
Told you, nothing more to say.

Id: [0x001FEF64]
You want that shipment? Lot of water between here and Thera, better get to it.

Id: [0x001FEF6A]
Of course, my friends!

Id: [0x001FEF6C]
<i>Malákes.</i>

Id: [0x001FEF6D]
Thank you.

Id: [0x001FEF6E]
If you find that <i>miltos</i>, be sure to come back and share the wealth!

Id: [0x001FEF70]
I'm always open to a good tale, especially if it ends in misfortune.

Id: [0x001FEF71]
Ha, the ones with Gotarzes always do. He's the worst captain on Keos!

Id: [0x001FEF95]
You've more than made up for killing my "abductors," <i>misthios</i>. Thank you.

Id: [0x001FEF9C]
Try to stay out of trouble, all right?

Id: [0x001FEF9F]
Do me a favor and tell your friends the truth next time.

Id: [0x001FEFA2]
I'll consider it. Put my coins to good use, and wish me luck.

Id: [0x001FEFA3]
Good luck.

Id: [0x001FEFAB]
Pray for the farmer. The bull was his, its sacrifice will help feed the people of Argolis.

Id: [0x001FEFB3]
The rest is in the hands of the gods.

Id: [0x001FEFB4]
I did my part, priest.

Id: [0x001FEFB5]
The Spartan woman you're after...

Id: [0x001FEFB6]
You've met her?

Id: [0x001FEFB7]
Her visit to the sanctuary is legendary, but sadly it was before my time. The man you want is Mydon the Elder Priest. He spoke of her often. That is, before he cut out his tongue.

Id: [0x001FEFB8]
Cut out his tongue?

Id: [0x001FEFB9]
When he's not healing the sick he's in the guesthouse. Spends a lot of his time being... tended to by servants.

Id: [0x001FEFBA]
Thank you. I won't forget you helped me.

Id: [0x001FEFBB]
And these people won't forget you helped them.

Id: [0x001FEFC0]
Pray for this woman. The world has too many orphans already.

Id: [0x001FEFC3]
[&breath][sighs][/&breath]It will be done.

Id: [0x001FEFCA]
I know what it's like to be small and forsaken. Pray for the girl.

Id: [0x001FEFD0]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001FEFD1]
Gods bless you, misthios! My children thank you.

Id: [0x001FEFD2]
You'll pay for this!

Id: [0x001FEFD3]
You'll regret this!

Id: [0x001FF01E]
More like under, knowing Gotarzes!

Id: [0x001FF024]
Apologies, I... I've been at sea, and my curiosity got the better of me.

Id: [0x001FF025]
Huh, no worry about manners here. Cause trouble, though, and you'll answer to Xenia.

Id: [0x001FF027]
Yeah, we've both been to sea. Boring as fuck, and no one minded their manners on any of the vessels I sailed!

Id: [0x001FF02B]
You again. Thought you'd be sick of ports, or are you looking for work?

Id: [0x001FF02C]
Just wanted to ask about that shipment.

Id: [0x001FF02D]
Oh, yeah?

Id: [0x001FF032]
Sounds like a tale for another day. I'll be seeing you.

Id: [0x001FF034]
Not if we see you first!

Id: [0x001FF035]
Ha, good one!

Id: [0x001FF039]
I'd like to find this ship.

Id: [0x001FF03A]
Well, I'll help you if you can. Then you can bring us a story.

Id: [0x001FF041]
Not much to tell, really.

Id: [0x001FF042]
Better get going if you want to find it. Lot of water between here and Thera.

Id: [0x001FF04F]
Fucking Athenians want it all for themselves, self-important <i>malákas</i>.

Id: [0x001FF050]
Do you know where I can find the ship?

Id: [0x001FF051]
Could be anywhere, knowing Gotarzes!

Id: [0x001FF052]
I heard the plan was to intercept the shipment near Lestris Island, due south of Keos.

Id: [0x001FF053]
What's <i>miltos</i>, anyway?

Id: [0x001FF054]
<i>Miltos</i>, the next best thing to gold.

Id: [0x001FF065]
I've had enough training, thanks.

Id: [0x001FF07F]
Guards!

Id: [0x001FF080]
They're dead.

Id: [0x001FF082]
And you must be Mydon.

Id: [0x001FF084]
He doesn't speak.

Id: [0x001FF085]
So I've heard. I'm here to find out why.

Id: [0x001FF086]
Chrysis did this to him.

Id: [0x001FF08A]
Now why would Chrysis want an elder priest to cut out his tongue?

Id: [0x001FF08B]
Mydon is a caring, generous man!

Id: [0x001FF08D]
I want answers from him, not you. Tell me about the Spartan woman and her baby.

Id: [0x001FF08F]
He can only answer yes or no.

Id: [0x001FF0C2]
Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x001FF0C3]
I was on my way home when a man dressed in black attacked me. I ran as fast as I could. Once I reached safety, I thought I heard wolves. Maybe they scared him away.

Id: [0x001FF0C4]
Why would someone attack you?

Id: [0x001FF0C7]
My neighbor thinks I'm bad luck. He may be right.

Id: [0x001FF0D7]
<i>Misthios</i>! You scared me.

Id: [0x001FF103]
Absolutely. I wouldn't want you to make a hasty judgement.

Id: [0x001FF105]
What do you think? Who tried to kill me?

Id: [0x001FF109]
Your neighbor tried to kill you.

Id: [0x001FF10A]
I knew it!

Id: [0x001FF110]
It was your landlord.

Id: [0x001FF111]
Of course! He wants me out of the way.

Id: [0x001FF118]
The Spartan woman, was her name Myrrine?

Id: [0x001FF11A]
They said she had a baby with her.

Id: [0x001FF11C]
Was it hers?

Id: [0x001FF11E]
The baby was close to death when they arrived. Mydon prayed for its life!

Id: [0x001FF120]
You saved the child?

Id: [0x001FF122]
No?

Id: [0x001FF123]
He did everything he could, but the baby was badly wounded.

Id: [0x001FF125]
Every time, Gotarzes!

Id: [0x001FF126]
Doesn't look good! We're fucking marooned!

Id: [0x001FF128]
I thought he did this to himself.

Id: [0x001FF129]
To prove his loyalty to her!

Id: [0x001FF12A]
Did she tell you where she was going?

Id: [0x001FF139]
If I can find this shipment of <i>miltos... </i>It's easy money.

Id: [0x001FF13B]
Do all sanctuary priests take their servants to bed?

Id: [0x001FF13D]
I am not his servant! We share a sacred bond!

Id: [0x001FF13F]
<i>Sacred</i>. Right.

Id: [0x001FF140]
You're the captain. We fucking blame you for crashing!

Id: [0x001FF143]
It was simple. An unarmed merchant ship! You gave that to Poseidon, and then ran us onto the rocks.

Id: [0x001FF144]
We aren't far from Keos. Someone'll find us.

Id: [0x001FF145]
I hope the sharks find <i>you</i> first.

Id: [0x001FF147]
Go away!

Id: [0x001FF14A]
Well, if it had been an easy job you'd have done it yourself.

Id: [0x001FF14C]
I know why Chrysis made you cut out your tongue.

Id: [0x001FF14E]
The night my <i>mater</i> brought my brother here, you and your priests left him for dead. And Chrysis didn't like you telling the story.

Id: [0x001FF150]
That's not what happened!

Id: [0x001FF153]
What do you know? You're too young to have been there.

Id: [0x001FF154]
He told me the story many times before that witch stole his voice. He tried to save the baby! Did everything he could.

Id: [0x001FF156]
He wept for that Spartan woman, so far from home. Her baby barely recognizable, hardly breathing.

Id: [0x001FF15C]
Chrysis should have had <i>your</i> tongue cut out! I want answers from someone who was actually there that night.

Id: [0x001FF162]
Ever since I heard Kleon speak of Mytilene, I've known something was wrong and have been taking steps to find out just what.

Id: [0x001FF178]
Stop!

Id: [0x001FF191]
Chrysis took the baby, didn't she?

Id: [0x001FF193]
And she made you cut out your tongue to hide the truth.

Id: [0x001FF1A0]
How will I find it without the tablet?!

Id: [0x001FF1A1]
That double-crossing <i>malákas!</i>

Id: [0x001FF1A2]
My plans! They're ruined.

Id: [0x001FF1A3]
Where is Chrysis?

Id: [0x001FF1A5]
So <i>now</i> you want to hear what I have to say?

Id: [0x001FF1A9]
The hetaerae aren't here!

Id: [0x001FF1AB]
I see. Chrysis possesses every tongue around here. I'll find her on my own then, and cut out a lot more. <LF>

Id: [0x001FF1AD]
Surprise!

Id: [0x001FF1AE]
Don't test me. Speak!

Id: [0x001FF1B1]
There is an altar where people offer their sick babies to be healed. This is where she took the child. Find it near the statue of Apollo Maleatas, and you'll find Chrysis.

Id: [0x001FF1B2]
People come to this sanctuary to heal - but I come here and find people dying without hope, priests without tongues, and babies left with an insane woman.

Id: [0x001FF1B9]
Has Damalis told you what's wrong?

Id: [0x001FF1BA]
She hasn't told me much, but I know these girls as well as I know myself. Something's not right.

Id: [0x001FF1C0]
What's wrong with Erinna?

Id: [0x001FF1C1]
She's looking for Kleio - another hetaera - who's gone missing. I've been too distracted to help in the search.

Id: [0x001FF1C3]
Tell me, please. I need to know.

Id: [0x001FF1C4]
Not even Apollo could save the child. Mydon told me how the Spartan woman wept. Held the baby in her arms, sang to him, before finally leaving him to the gods.

Id: [0x001FF1DB]
We've told you everything we know. Now leave us be!

Id: [0x001FF1E5]
Calm down. Hippokrates sent me.

Id: [0x001FF1E6]
The great doctor is concerned for <i>my</i> health?

Id: [0x001FF1E7]
And I'm a <i>misthios</i>. If I stop this killer, will you speak with me?

Id: [0x001FF1E8]
I will.

Id: [0x001FF1EB]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x001FF1EC]
No, thank Hera.

Id: [0x001FF1EE]
There's a difference between insulting someone and attacking them. What else?

Id: [0x001FF1EF]
[&breath]I'm behind on my rent. I think my landlord wants to get rid of me and find a new tenant.

Id: [0x001FF1F4]
I'll find out who wants you dead.

Id: [0x001FF1F5]
It was either my neighbor or my landlord who attacked me. But you can't punish someone unless you know they're guilty.

Id: [0x001FF1F6]
I'll be back when I've figured it out. Then we're talking about your past.

Id: [0x001FF241]
If you believe there's something at the akropolis that will help, I'll find it.

Id: [0x001FF24E]
I don't know for sure, but I think it was our neighbor.

Id: [0x001FF251]
Did you see someone attack Dolops?

Id: [0x001FF252]
Yes! It was terrible.

Id: [0x001FF253]
Who did it?

Id: [0x001FF254]
I couldn't see clearly, but I think it was that bull-headed neighbor of his. He must have finally snapped.

Id: [0x001FF255]
Thanks for letting me know.

Id: [0x001FF25C]
It was our landlord. I know it.

Id: [0x001FF25F]
I'm looking for the person who attacked Dolops.

Id: [0x001FF260]
I saw it happen! His face was covered, but I'm sure it was our landlord. He lives all alone, and hires soldiers to protect him. He has to be hiding something.

Id: [0x001FF263]
Thanks for letting me know.

Id: [0x001FF268]
Ah, there you are.

Id: [0x001FF269]
Climb aboard. Get out of that shark-infested water.

Id: [0x001FF281]
Your landlord is dead. He was a lot more than that, though.

Id: [0x001FF282]
He... was one of those people, wasn't he? I can't...

Id: [0x001FF284]
You wanted to know something?

Id: [0x001FF285]
Hippokrates said you used to work with orphans.

Id: [0x001FF286]
I did, but Chrysis drove me away.

Id: [0x001FF287]
At a secret meeting in Delphi, I overheard Chrysis mention a great warrior. Could these children have been part of her plan?

Id: [0x001FF291]
Thanks for giving me the benefit of the doubt.

Id: [0x001FF294]
I heard someone tried to kill your neighbor.

Id: [0x001FF295]
Dolops? That mouse turd? [&ah]Who'd give him trouble?

Id: [0x001FF296]
People say it's you.

Id: [0x001FF297]
He's a fool. I like to give him a hard time - but I wouldn't try to kill him.

Id: [0x001FF29C]
When we first met, you wouldn't admit to tampering with the ostracism. Now you openly discuss murdering a man.

Id: [0x001FF29D]
Not a man. Kleon.

Id: [0x001FF29E]
Think of him as you will, but his heart beats the same as yours or mine. We don't get to decide when death comes for ourselves, so why should we for others?

Id: [0x001FF2A4]
I know your type. You like roughing up people smaller than you. Time to pick on someone your own size.

Id: [0x001FF2A9]
I don't think you did it, but you're going to have to clear your name.

Id: [0x001FF2AC]
You let my mother believe her baby was dead.

Id: [0x001FF2AD]
But he was. Oh, how she wept when his little heart stopped beating. But then <i>I</i> took care of him. Placed him on this very altar. Screamed for the gods to spare his life. And they listened.

Id: [0x001FF2AE]
Don't you dare speak of my family, snake.

Id: [0x001FF2AF]
I still remember the night your mother brought me my child. The sad, pathetic thing, crying in the rain. Had I known then that Myrrine had <i>two</i> children... but, here you are. My family is complete.

Id: [0x001FF2B2]
This armor is broken, but it was valuable. If it belonged to the attacker, he's either wealthy, or very lucky.

Id: [0x001FF2B6]
This knife has seen better days... like something a poor farmer would use.

Id: [0x001FF2BA]
This black cloth is fine enough for a king. Would do well as a mask, too.

Id: [0x001FF2BE]
You have always been honest with me. Since we first met, and you admitted to tampering with the ostracism vote, you've proven you care about the truth. And that is what I seek now.

Id: [0x001FF2BF]
What if there's nothing to find?

Id: [0x001FF2C0]
Then we'll act accordingly. Preparing for an outcome that may never exist helps no one, wouldn't you agree?

Id: [0x001FF2C3]
I'll take care of him.

Id: [0x001FF2C4]
Good luck.

Id: [0x001FF2C5]
I'll take care of him.

Id: [0x001FF2C6]
Be careful. He's dangerous.

Id: [0x001FF2C7]
How'd you know I needed help?

Id: [0x001FF2C8]
Anthousa told me you could use a hand.

Id: [0x001FF2D2]
Then you'll have to come with me. A patient Hippokrates is treating will die without your help.

Id: [0x001FF2D3]
I have a patient right here who needs my help.

Id: [0x001FF2D9]
Can't someone else take care of this one?

Id: [0x001FF2DA]
I'm the only doctor here. Now let me work.

Id: [0x001FF2E0]
I'll go get your bone forceps.

Id: [0x001FF2E3]
<i>Mater</i>...

Id: [0x001FF2E7]
That weakling crawled to the hills of Korinth. The Monger was supposed to deliver her back to me. But she can't hide forever. She will give us more children.

Id: [0x001FF2E8]
I'll run my spear through your throat for the pain you've caused.

Id: [0x001FF2E9]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]This world is pain. I gave Deimos strength to cope.

Id: [0x001FF2F0]
There isn't enough time. I need you at Hippokrates's camp, now.

Id: [0x001FF2F7]
<i>Mater</i>.

Id: [0x001FF2F8]
Is this it?

Id: [0x001FF2F9]
You aren't a half-bad assistant. When I'm done with this surgery, I'll be honored to help Hippokrates.

Id: [0x001FF2FB]
Might be limping for a while, but Apollo willing, they'll make a full recovery.

Id: [0x001FF308]
This goes beyond my family. You and your Cult are going to destroy the Greek world. You bring nothing but suffering.

Id: [0x001FF30A]
You talk of suffering and yet you come drenched in blood and threaten my life. You are a killer, just like your brother. Here, let me show you.

Id: [0x001FF312]
I'll wait here for you to finish. If I leave, what's stopping you from running away?

Id: [0x001FF313]
Thinking like a mercenary. Guess I shouldn't be surprised.

Id: [0x001FF317]
A warning. Must be getting close.

Id: [0x001FF31B]
Then make yourself useful and bring me my bone forceps. Some idiot or another is always borrowing them.

Id: [0x001FF323]
What kind of message do you want to send?

Id: [0x001FF324]
Sinking some ships while flying her colors should do the trick.

Id: [0x001FF327]
No arguments here.

Id: [0x001FF329]
The doctor sent me to get his bone forceps, but I don't have them yet.

Id: [0x001FF32C]
So you're only here because of this patient.

Id: [0x001FF342]
You were gone so long. He didn't survive.

Id: [0x001FF345]
Hippokrates! How is your patient?

Id: [0x001FF349]
I'm sorry, Hippokrates. We took more time because this <i>misthios</i> helped me save my own patient.

Id: [0x001FF34A]
Sometimes science requires tough decisions.

Id: [0x001FF352]
He'll live.

Id: [0x001FF353]
Your <i>misthios</i> friend murdered a patient I was treating, then attacked me!

Id: [0x001FF354]
Is that true, Kassandra?

Id: [0x001FF355]
I did what I had to.

Id: [0x001FF357]
We should not decide who lives and who dies.

Id: [0x001FF35A]
I wish I could say the same for my patient.

Id: [0x001FF35B]
What patient?

Id: [0x001FF35C]
Your <i>misthios</i> friend attacked me while I was in the middle of an operation!

Id: [0x001FF35D]
While you did save my patient, the other did not deserve their fate.

Id: [0x001FF360]
It was the only way to get him here in time.

Id: [0x001FF361]
If we're finished here, I'll take some time and write down what I remember of your notes, Hippokrates.

Id: [0x001FF36D]
How's the patient, Hippokrates?

Id: [0x001FF379]
Hippokrates! How's the patient?

Id: [0x001FF397]
I have learned a lesson today. I'll take some time and write down what I remember of your notes, Hippokrates.

Id: [0x001FF3A1]
I went to see the priests first. I had to find out about my mother.

Id: [0x001FF3A2]
A worthy pursuit, though it cost this man his life.

Id: [0x001FF3A3]
I couldn't remember the proper steps for treatment, and you were gone so long.

Id: [0x001FF410]
Keep the fuck out of this. The captain's gonna get what's comin' to him!

Id: [0x001FF412]
Did he offend you - poor, delicate pirates?

Id: [0x001FF414]
Should never have agreed to work with this <i>malákas</i>. We finally get a job from Xenia, and he sails us into the fucking ground.

Id: [0x001FF416]
What hasn't he done?

Id: [0x001FF417]
How did you end up on this island?

Id: [0x001FF419]
I can explain. I am the captain...

Id: [0x001FF41A]
Oh, we've heard enough from you, <i>captain</i>.

Id: [0x001FF41B]
I'll hear it from the captain himself.

Id: [0x001FF41D]
As I was saying... We got into a great sea battle - which we won, thanks to me - and the victory was so sweet! I didn't notice how close to the rocks we were. A minor accident. Now, if you could just get us back to Keos?

Id: [0x001FF420]
Stand aside.

Id: [0x001FF422]
It's your crew. Answer to them.

Id: [0x001FF424]
Please no, you must protect me!

Id: [0x001FF426]
This man is your captain.

Id: [0x001FF427]
You can only be a captain if you got a ship, and he ain't got one no more.

Id: [0x001FF429]
I can make it worth your while if you get me back to Keos.

Id: [0x001FF42F]
By the gods, help me!

Id: [0x001FF432]
Get out of my way. I'm taking Captain Gotarzes back to Keos.

Id: [0x001FF433]
You'll be sorry you stuck your nose in where it don't belong. He's fucked us over too many times. No, the Captain won't leave here alive.

Id: [0x001FF435]
Get behind me and stay close.

Id: [0x001FF437]
Ares, protect me!

Id: [0x001FF43C]
Aaargh! Help me!

Id: [0x001FF43E]
Make your peace with Poseidon, Captain.

Id: [0x001FF441]
More Monger trouble?

Id: [0x001FF442]
I wouldn't doubt it. Work against their aggressors, and then it will be his turn to suffer. You'll find Damalis here at the spring, but Erinna has gone to Bellerophron's Garden.

Id: [0x001FF44F]
Chrysis is a servant of Hera. She does what needs to be done.

Id: [0x001FF450]
What needs to be done? She left your baby to burn alive!

Id: [0x001FF452]
And you saved him. Gods bless you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x001FF454]
Sleep now sweet child, <i>mater </i>is here.

Id: [0x001FF456]
My child!

Id: [0x001FF45B]
Some people might see duty as a good enough reason, I guess.

Id: [0x001FF45C]
The greater good is all we should care about.

Id: [0x001FF45D]
Easy to say if you've never worried about going hungry.

Id: [0x001FF45E]
I eat to live, but I do not live to eat.

Id: [0x001FF460]
It seems you know yourself well, but know it is better to change one's thoughts than to persist in those that are wrong.

Id: [0x001FF461]
My thoughts are fine.

Id: [0x001FF463]
It moves when I need it to.

Id: [0x001FF473]
I'm heading home to Chios. Bring the pelts to me there.

Id: [0x001FF475]
Sounds like a good trade to work in. You don't want to be a hetaerae?

Id: [0x001FF476]
Not in my prime anymore, am I, <i>misthios</i>? By the time I study what they did, I'll be serving clients on my deathbed!

Id: [0x001FF477]
So her name means something to you.

Id: [0x001FF478]
Anthousa? She's been around forever, but I never met her. I know the hetaerae all work as one - on equal footing - but Anthousa's special. She talks - they listen.

Id: [0x001FF479]
If you say so.

Id: [0x001FF47A]
A strategy for those who must be adaptable. Or for those who wish to justify their actions.

Id: [0x001FF47B]
I decide if my actions are just.

Id: [0x001FF47C]
And will likely move again if what you say is true.

Id: [0x001FF47D]
It may.

Id: [0x001FF487]
I'm not sure saving that baby was the right thing to do. Chrysis's reign of terror must end.<LF>

Id: [0x001FF48B]
A wise decision, dear <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x001FF48C]
I haven't made it this far being a fool. I know when to take a chance.

Id: [0x001FF48F]
Negotiation always involves some compromise, you know.

Id: [0x001FF490]
Compromise I can do. But I won't be cheated.

Id: [0x001FF49B]
What does someone have to do to be ostracized?

Id: [0x001FF49C]
Anyone seen as a threat to the city or the people is enough. And then it is up to the vote. Some have been ostracized for simply being more disliked than the person they're up against.

Id: [0x001FF4A2]
I've been here. Spying. And I heard him mumbling to himself! [beat]He's weird. But maybe if I tell you what he said, it could help?

Id: [0x001FF4A6]
That's... not what I expected.

Id: [0x001FF4A9]
Gotarzes! I thought I'd lost you this time. [beat]Where's your ship?

Id: [0x001FF4BD]
Let's hear it.

Id: [0x001FF4C5]
You speak of family, yet you send Cult puppets to silence your own son. They're dead, by the way.

Id: [0x001FF4C6]
Dolops ceased being my son when he turned his back on the gods.

Id: [0x001FF4C7]
You mean turned his back on you.

Id: [0x001FF4C8]
The baby was destined to be mine! He was too stupid to understand that.

Id: [0x001FF4D9]
Anaxagoras has been exiled. From what I heard, he'll be heading to an island south of here.

Id: [0x001FF4DC]
Let me think... He said something about having to meet someone at Phaia's Pig Farm tonight. That could help!

Id: [0x001FF4DD]
I'm going to talk to Damalis's client and see what he has to say.

Id: [0x001FF4E8]
[&breath]Maláka. [beat]What's important is that you're alive, brother.

Id: [0x001FF4EA]
He's your brother?

Id: [0x001FF4EB]
It would be easier is he wasn't.

Id: [0x001FF4EC]
He would be dead.

Id: [0x001FF4ED]
Then you will be rewarded, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x001FF4EE]
Those dogs turned on me. If it wasn't for this <i>misthios</i> -

Id: [0x001FF4F3]
And you think his life is worth a ship?

Id: [0x001FF4F4]
Ships can be rebuilt. A life cannot.

Id: [0x001FF4F6]
You've spent too much time with Athenians.

Id: [0x001FF4FE]
You take children from their mothers and silence anyone who gets in your way.

Id: [0x001FF4FF]
If you're referring to Mydon, it was he who chose to slice off his cursed tongue.

Id: [0x001FF500]
I'm talking about the farmer you had killed in Epidauros.

Id: [0x001FF50A]
The rocks around the isle were treacherous.

Id: [0x001FF50C]
Oh, I'm well aware of his nautical prowess. A goat could sail those waters.

Id: [0x001FF50E]
Your armor Gotarzes. Give it to her.

Id: [0x001FF50F]
But this was father's. It's mine by birthright.

Id: [0x001FF510]
Now.

Id: [0x001FF513]
Fine...

Id: [0x001FF514]
Come with me, stupid brother.

Id: [0x001FF516]
Thank you, Kassandra. Family is family, and for his life I thank you.

Id: [0x001FF524]
[beat]Fine. <i>Chaire, </i>old man.

Id: [0x001FF527]
Tell Damalis I'll stop. That I'm sorry.

Id: [0x001FF530]
Have you seen my ship? I heard you set sail to find it.

Id: [0x001FF532]
It shipwrecked on the island.

Id: [0x001FF534]
I'm not leaving yet.

Id: [0x001FF536]
On second thought, no, I don't have time for this. Leave me. Now.

Id: [0x001FF537]
Did you run into its captain, Gotarzes?

Id: [0x001FF53B]
His armor -

Id: [0x001FF53C]
Belongs to someone worthy of it.

Id: [0x001FF541]
His crew mutinied. I tried to save him.

Id: [0x001FF542]
Take you drachmae and get out of my sight.

Id: [0x001FF543]
I've seen that iron poker used before.

Id: [0x001FF545]
Huge like the Monger?

Id: [0x001FF546]
<i>Just</i> like the Monger.

Id: [0x001FF548]
You <i>tried</i>?!

Id: [0x001FF550]
Then I don't need your memory. I just need to find the right stone.

Id: [0x001FF552]
Um, yes, of course. That's very wise, indeed. If only I had the time to help you...

Id: [0x001FF563]
Listen, I'm not here to hurt you. I'm just looking for my <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x001FF565]
Then don't tell me anything - just bring me to the stone that can.

Id: [0x001FF567]
It's Chrysis. She's got every priest in the sanctuary under her thumb, and she'll squash anyone who feeds information to the Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x001FF570]
Devoted to Sparta until the end. [beat]I'm sorry. You heard of his death?

Id: [0x001FF571]
I did. A shame.

Id: [0x001FF578]
I should never have gone back out to sea.

Id: [0x001FF57E]
But he disappeared, and his body was never found. The state pronounced him dead.

Id: [0x001FF57F]
That's all right. I haven't seen him since I was a child.

Id: [0x001FF581]
You go to one symposium, and everyone wants to know you!

Id: [0x001FF586]
We've got company. Friends of yours?

Id: [0x001FF588]
From what I know, she wanted them to forget<i>.</i>

Id: [0x001FF58D]
My mother came through here, and unless you want me to paint these stones with your blood, you'll tell me what you know.

Id: [0x001FF58E]
Please... It's Chrysis. She said that anyone who talks to the Eagle Bearer will be paying a visit to Hades.

Id: [0x001FF58F]
Then don't talk. Just bring me to the stone that can.

Id: [0x001FF591]
Follow me, then. Quickly, we must be discreet.

Id: [0x001FF595]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x001FF598]
Then you'll come treat Hippokrates's patient?

Id: [0x001FF599]
You have my word.

Id: [0x001FF59F]
I don't need the history, just the details.

Id: [0x001FF5A0]
Definitely not the right one.

Id: [0x001FF5A3]
This is hopeless.

Id: [0x001FF5A4]
These stories <i>give</i> people hope, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x001FF5A5]
Well, I'm losing mine.

Id: [0x001FF5A6]
And what about this one? Let me guess: it tells the tale of a blind woman who had her eyes licked by snakes.

Id: [0x001FF5A8]
Ah! I remember this tale. Written during the time of the great Helot Revolt. You would have been only a child.

Id: [0x001FF5A9]
It tells the tale of a woman with worms in her throat. Asklepios took off her head so we could remove them, then reattached it in her sleep.

Id: [0x001FF5AA]
This one tells the tale of a man with sword wounds. A pack of dogs licked him clean, and eureka! A man's best friend indeed.

Id: [0x001FF5C3]
Who does know where she went?

Id: [0x001FF5C5]
We've been spotted. Meet me later, near the Olive Tree of Herakles at the entrance of the sanctuary. I may have something for you.

Id: [0x001FF5C7]
And what do we have here, a priest and a mercenary out for a friendly stroll?

Id: [0x001FF5C8]
May the gods be with you, Pleistos! I was just on my way to the archives when this <i>misthios </i>bumped into me<i>.</i>

Id: [0x001FF5C9]
Is that so? And what were you both chatting about so fervently, might I ask?

Id: [0x001FF5CD]
Last time his name came out of a fool's mouth, the man's tongue was <i>sliced </i>out.

Id: [0x001FF5CE]
Not only that, but <i>power.</i> Once he smells it on you, you're a goner!

Id: [0x001FF5E4]
I'll go see the priests for more information about my mother.

Id: [0x001FF5E6]
I sent your mother to the Sanctuary of Asklepios. Tell the elder priest a treatment for the Sacred Disease will soon be available to any patient who needs it. Then he may talk to you.

Id: [0x001FF5EE]
Hippokrates, I'm sorry the patient died. But I still need to know what happened to my mother.

Id: [0x001FF5F3]
Her word is absolute. You know that.

Id: [0x001FF5F5]
[&hmm]Erm[/&hmm], yes... that's correct. The bath house is right over there. Now if you'll excuse me.

Id: [0x001FF5F8]
We treat the sick, Eagle Bearer, and we respect the privacy of those we've treated. Now please leave. Your presence can only cause harm.<LF>

Id: [0x001FF5FD]
The good priest here was teaching me how to heal sword wounds.

Id: [0x001FF5FE]
[&ahem]Erm[/&ahem], yes... sword wounds...

Id: [0x001FF5FF]
Oh really? And what is the treatment for sword wounds according to Timoxenos here?

Id: [0x001FF609]
[&ah]Um...[/&ah] olives. You stuff the wounds with olives - prevents bleeding.

Id: [0x001FF60A]
Olives, [&scoff]that's a new one. Most impressive, Timoxenos.

Id: [0x001FF60E]
[&ah]Um...[/&ah] snakes. You wrap snakes around the wound to stop the bleeding.

Id: [0x001FF610]
Ooh! A most ingenious treatment wouldn't you say, Timoxenos?

Id: [0x001FF61E]
There better be. You've seen what happens to people I disagree with.

Id: [0x001FF620]
Let's get to my ship and get you home, then.

Id: [0x001FF625]
Some fight, eh? Thank you, stranger. Now if you can just get me to Keos, there's a reward in it for you.

Id: [0x001FF634]
"Desperate times." Isn't that what you said?

Id: [0x001FF635]
So I did. Follow my lead and respond as if you were one of Kleon's supporters, not mine.

Id: [0x001FF636]
I'll do my best.

Id: [0x001FF637]
That would do it.

Id: [0x001FF638]
We'd lure him into Korinthia's Sacred Cave, and it'd be over.

Id: [0x001FF648]
Dogs.

Id: [0x001FF649]
What about them?

Id: [0x001FF64A]
You use dogs to lick the wounds clean.

Id: [0x001FF64C]
Very good! Don't give away all our tricks, Timoxenos. Who will bring offerings to the gods when our patients learn to heal themselves?

Id: [0x001FF64E]
[&laughs][laughs nervously][/&laughs]No, no, of course not. Now if you'll excuse me, I have matters to attend to.

Id: [0x001FF650]
You have your treatment, <i>misthios.</i> Now please leave the sanctuary.

Id: [0x001FF655]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x001FF656]
I wanted to help?

Id: [0x001FF658]
Give her here.

Id: [0x001FF659]
Leave, Phoibe. Now!

Id: [0x001FF665]
I thank you for your discretion, Eagle Bearer. Chrysis has many eyes and ears throughout the sanctuary.

Id: [0x001FF666]
What else can you tell me about the Spartan woman and child?

Id: [0x001FF668]
The woman left the child's blanket behind. We tried to return it, but it was too painful a memory for her.

Id: [0x001FF669]
Where did she go? What happened to the child?

Id: [0x001FF66E]
Do you have my notes?

Id: [0x001FF66F]
I'm sorry, they were burned when the fort was attacked.

Id: [0x001FF670]
No!

Id: [0x001FF671]
I tried to bring the fort's doctor, but he was killed before we could get here.

Id: [0x001FF672]
That's awful. I'll have to do my best...

Id: [0x001FF678]
He's dead.

Id: [0x001FF679]
I wish I could have helped you more.

Id: [0x001FF67A]
I can't fault you for trying.

Id: [0x001FF683]
Hippokrates, I'm sorry. There was a problem getting your notes...

Id: [0x001FF684]
What took you so long? Did you go see the priests first?

Id: [0x001FF685]
I couldn't miss that chance.

Id: [0x001FF686]
Well, this patient couldn't wait for your personal concerns.

Id: [0x001FF68A]
So, Chrysis was right. You knew the rules, Timoxenos. You will suffer her wrath.

Id: [0x001FF68B]
Pleistos, please!

Id: [0x001FF68C]
Get behind me, priest. I'll deal with these two.

Id: [0x001FF6A1]
He knew the penalty for speaking with the Eagle Bearer about... her. Chrysis was clear.

Id: [0x001FF6A2]
You didn't have to kill him.

Id: [0x001FF6A3]
But we did... and now we'll kill you.

Id: [0x001FF6B3]
Are all the testimonies so... outrageous?

Id: [0x001FF6B4]
Writers today - Thucydides, Euripides, the petulant Aristophanes... All of them try for realism, but - what really inspires is greatness, magic, gods!

Id: [0x001FF6C2]
[beat]Yes. And we need some information.

Id: [0x001FF6C3]
Tell him someone tried to kill me.

Id: [0x001FF6C4]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x001FF6C5]
Lies!

Id: [0x001FF6C6]
You're... escaping? From what?

Id: [0x001FF6C7]
You have no idea what the Monger does to people. The things I've seen. No one in Korinth is safe.

Id: [0x001FF6C8]
She clearly disagrees.

Id: [0x001FF6CC]
Maybe we both should have died here that day.

Id: [0x001FF6CD]
But...

Id: [0x001FF6CE]
The gods are cruel.

Id: [0x001FF6D1]
And would you follow someone you found out had lied to you for their own gain?

Id: [0x001FF6D4]
Everyone makes mistakes! I would continue to follow them.

Id: [0x001FF6D6]
It is only natural to believe the person you follow is worth your loyalty. However, those who are untrustworthy do not deserve to lead.

Id: [0x001FF6D8]
People who lie to me don't deserve my trust.

Id: [0x001FF6E1]
That probably could have gone better. But, even so, I believe the people are unable to deny the proof we presented.

Id: [0x001FF6E5]
I'm here for information.

Id: [0x001FF6E6]
In that case you can go straight to Hades.

Id: [0x001FF6EA]
Filthy! Disgusting creatures! I can't work under these conditions!

Id: [0x001FF6F6]
I need to know about a Spartan woman who came through here many years ago.

Id: [0x001FF6F7]
Did that eagle of yours shit in your ears? I'm under strict orders not to talk to any mercenaries. Especially not about Spartan women or injured babies.

Id: [0x001FF708]
I sailed by the island. There was a wreck, but nothing else.

Id: [0x001FF70A]
Liar! I know your ship was anchored offshore.

Id: [0x001FF70B]
The crew mutinied. There was nothing I could do.

Id: [0x001FF70C]
If I find out you killed my brother, you will regret it.

Id: [0x001FF70D]
Brother?

Id: [0x001FF70E]
Gotarzes and I are family.

Id: [0x001FF70F]
I'm sorry - If I'd known...

Id: [0x001FF710]
Get the fuck out of my sight!

Id: [0x001FF793]
I suppose I could get your directions.

Id: [0x001FF796]
I think I'll pass.

Id: [0x001FF797]
If you change your mind, I'll be here.

Id: [0x001FF799]
Poseidon blesses me with good fortune at last!

Id: [0x001FF79A]
So, where am I going?

Id: [0x001FF79B]
To the other side of the island. You'll find the tablet in the leader's house there. Once you have it, head to the nearby Village of Poieessa and deliver it to my associate.

Id: [0x001FF7A8]
Don't worry, I'll get what you want.

Id: [0x001FF7A9]
Xenia will be thrilled! I await your return.

Id: [0x001FF7B0]
Kleio? Kleio? Has anyone seen Kleio?

Id: [0x001FF7B8]
You can't swim?

Id: [0x001FF7B9]
I'm a pirate, course I can fucking swim. [beat]I... just don't like sharks.

Id: [0x001FF7BA]
So you're a coward, not a weakling.

Id: [0x001FF7BB]
I don't need to swim if I have a reliable mercenary to do it for me.

Id: [0x001FF7BE]
Follow me!

Id: [0x001FF7C0]
You sound troubled.

Id: [0x001FF7C1]
I'm trying to steal Xenia a great treasure to celebrate her victory over Keos, but the directions have been stolen.

Id: [0x001FF7C6]
And I suppose you want someone to steal them back?

Id: [0x001FF7C9]
I tried, but they were stolen by the leader of Koressia, who Xenia banished from the city. There's a new truce between them, and no pirate would touch that.

Id: [0x001FF7CD]
You're back, thank the gods. Have you reconsidered my offer?

Id: [0x001FF7CE]
What do you want now? I told you to meet my associate once you have the directions.

Id: [0x001FF7CF]
I have questions.

Id: [0x001FF7D6]
Armed? Take me to the ship. We'll get Kleio back.

Id: [0x001FF7D9]
I'll come back later if I have time.

Id: [0x001FF7E1]
Do you have time to find Kleio now?

Id: [0x001FF7E6]
The crew had turned on him.

Id: [0x001FF7E7]
I asked around. One of our clients said he saw Kleio brought aboard a ship. The men were armed, so there was nothing he could do. [beat]I'd pay a lot of drachmae to get her back.

Id: [0x001FF7E9]
My eagle will tear out your tongue, priest!

Id: [0x001FF7EA]
I'm so thankful Kleio is home. Please, take this for your trouble.

Id: [0x001FF7EB]
Good luck to both of you.

Id: [0x001FF7F0]
Forgive me! Not the tongue! Not like Mydon! Chrysis threatened anyone who speaks to the Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x001FF7F1]
You have my word.

Id: [0x001FF7FB]
Oh, Gotarzes...

Id: [0x001FF7FC]
He wrecked the ship - marooned his crew.

Id: [0x001FF7FD]
And?

Id: [0x001FF7FE]
The crew had the right to stand up for themselves.

Id: [0x001FF800]
You left my brother to die.

Id: [0x001FF801]
Your brother?

Id: [0x001FF803]
[&breath]I knew that cursed crew would kill him someday.

Id: [0x001FF806]
For what it's worth, you have my sympathy.

Id: [0x001FF807]
It's worth less than nothing.

Id: [0x001FF80A]
Did she? Tell me about the woman and her baby, and I won't drown you in your bathhouse. How's that for a threat?

Id: [0x001FF80B]
Please no! There's already a corpse in there!

Id: [0x001FF80C]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x001FF80F]
I never mentioned a baby.

Id: [0x001FF810]
Think you're so smart. Many women pass through with babies. Now leave me. I have my own problems to deal with.

Id: [0x001FF811]
Maybe I can help you.

Id: [0x001FF815]
Shouldn't you be in the marble quarry?

Id: [0x001FF817]
You talk to a pirate this way? I'll slice you!

Id: [0x001FF818]
Your unfinished-contract still thinks you're an artist.

Id: [0x001FF81A]
In my past, yes, I was<i>. </i>With a point of view my overseer<i> </i>always wanted to change. Request after request!

Id: [0x001FF81C]
That doesn't matter. I live on the sea now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

Id: [0x001FF81E]
In the choice hub, I am talking. Please wait.

Id: [0x001FF81F]
Are you sure I need to wait? I can't wait that long!

Id: [0x001FF820]
That doesn't matter. I live in the dialogue hub now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

Id: [0x001FF827]
A job's a job. I have to take you back.

Id: [0x001FF828]
See if you can make me.

Id: [0x001FF82B]
An artist stays an artist - it doesn't leave you. And if your point of view had to change, maybe it was to help you grow. And in the end, the art isn't for him. It's for yourself.

Id: [0x001FF82F]
...For myself. Maybe with the drachma I could rest. Create something <i>I </i>want created. [beat I'll finish the job.

Id: [0x001FF833]
Help me <i>grow</i>? It was a contract, malaka, it was never for me!

Id: [0x001FF836]
You really can't complete it?

Id: [0x001FF837]
I can't go on pleasing others and give myself nothing in return.

Id: [0x001FF838]
I'll think of something to tell him.

Id: [0x001FF839]
Then the chest's yours. And let me at your boat; I've learned a thing or two about carving figureheads.

Id: [0x001FF83D]
The Monger?

Id: [0x001FF83E]
We agree he should be killed, but we differ on <i>how</i>.

Id: [0x001FF83F]
Lucky for you I'm no pirate.

Id: [0x001FF840]
Are you saying you'll help me? There's something in it for you if you do.

Id: [0x001FF842]
I’m on the hunt for my mother, Myrrine, and the only way is through Anthousa.

Id: [0x001FF843]
Yes. Myrrine.

Id: [0x001FF855]
Snakes.

Id: [0x001FF856]
They're everywhere! Must have escaped from the tholos. We keep them for treatments, but they invaded the bathhouse.

Id: [0x001FF857]
The snakes killed someone?

Id: [0x001FF858]
A patient was purifying himself when they slithered in. Turns out he's terrified of snakes. Fell over dead. Now the snakes have made him their home.

Id: [0x001FF859]
What if I took care of your snake problem... Would you talk to me then?

Id: [0x001FF85A]
Oh most definitely. The purification bath is crucial in the path towards healing.

Id: [0x001FF85D]
Try not to kill them. Doreios will be furious if his sacred snakes get chopped to bits.

Id: [0x001FF85E]
Snakes!

Id: [0x001FF989]
Shouldn't you be in the marble quarry?

Id: [0x001FF98B]
You talk to a pirate this way? I'll slice you!

Id: [0x001FF98C]
Your unfinished-contract still thinks you're an artist.

Id: [0x001FF98E]
In my past, yes, I was<i>. </i>With a point of view my overseer<i> </i>always wanted to change. Request after request!

Id: [0x001FF98F]
He says you made a contract.

Id: [0x001FF990]
That doesn't matter. I live on the sea now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

Id: [0x001FF992]
In the choice hub, I am talking. Please wait.

Id: [0x001FF993]
Are you sure I need to wait? I can't wait that long!

Id: [0x001FF994]
That doesn't matter. I live in the dialogue hub now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

That doesn't matter. I live on the sea now - freely. And I'll give you what's in that chest if you leave me in peace.

Id: [0x001FF9C0]
I'll clear out these snakes in no time. Ikaros could use a good feast.

Id: [0x001FF9C1]
Then how am I supposed to deal with them?

Id: [0x001FF9C2]
Snakes are drawn to the bath's heat. Flood them with cold water, and they'll slither back to their hole. There's an underground pipe that may help you.

Id: [0x001FF9C3]
I'll take care of your snake problem. Then you'll tell me what I need to know.

Id: [0x001FF9CB]
I <i>do</i> love her, you know. With my whole heart.

Id: [0x001FF9CC]
And yet, you're scaring her.

Id: [0x001FF9CD]
Better me than another more careless man. Either I hurt Damalis, or I'm killed!

Id: [0x001FF9CE]
That's not love, it's weakness.

Id: [0x001FF9CF]
You say it as though I don't know. He knew that too. That's why he's making me!

Id: [0x001FF9D0]
Who's making you?

Id: [0x001FF9D2]
What does taking a bath have to do with healing the sick?

Id: [0x001FF9D3]
Asklepios only visits the dreams of the pure. When the sick arrive, they offer sacrifice, cleanse their bodies in the bathhouse.  Only then do we let them rest in the abaton, where Asklepios appears and heals them.

Id: [0x001FF9D4]
How did all these snakes get loose? And why are there so many at the sanctuary?

Id: [0x001FF9D5]
Family problems.

Id: [0x001FF9D9]
Blame Doreios. He's supposed to keep them in the <i>tholos</i>. Patients with afflictions of the mind are healed by the snakes. Their tongues are like kisses from the gods.

Id: [0x001FF9E3]
I really need those notes.

Id: [0x001FF9E7]
Curses, I should have made a second copy of my notes.

Id: [0x001FF9EB]
The humors are accumulating at an alarming rate... If only I had my notes.

Id: [0x001FF9EF]
I need someone with muscle to figure out what's behind the change. <i>Why </i>he's different.

Id: [0x001FF9F1]
It could. Did he mention why?

Id: [0x001FF9F2]
Oh, he said their name! Deinomenes. [beat]Wonder who that is?

Id: [0x001FF9F7]
I've been busy.

Id: [0x001FF9FB]
Not quite. Will this do?

Id: [0x001FF9FD]
Who is this?

Id: [0x001FF9FE]
Hippokrates! I'm sorry, your notes were destroyed. But I have them all in my head.

Id: [0x001FF9FF]
Then it is your duty to help me save this man's life.

Id: [0x001FFA01]
Poor, but there's still a chance. Did you find my notes?

Id: [0x001FFA05]
My fellow healer, I offer my humblest apologies.

Id: [0x001FFA06]
Time to rack my brain and reconstruct those notes - before another patient is lost.

Id: [0x001FFA13]
Maybe I should think about this some more.

Id: [0x001FFA16]
I think I should look for more evidence.

Id: [0x001FFBF9]
I carved up every single one of those slimy <i>malákes</i>.

Id: [0x001FFBFC]
My babies! What have you done to my babies?

Id: [0x001FFBFD]
Your snakes infested my bathhouse! A sick man is dead because of them.

Id: [0x001FFBFE]
You! You did this!

Id: [0x001FFC04]
Good snakes are dead snakes.

Id: [0x001FFC05]
You'll pay for this! I curse you!

Id: [0x001FFC0E]
I only did what Pylenor told me to do.

Id: [0x001FFC11]
What? How dare you? I never said kill them!

Id: [0x001FFC12]
How could you, Pylenor? You'll pay for this. I curse you both to Hades!

Id: [0x001FFC16]
Well?

Id: [0x001FFC17]
Well what?

Id: [0x001FFC18]
I took care of the snakes. Now you're going to tell me about the Spartan woman and the baby.

Id: [0x001FFC19]
[&laughs]I actually don't know anything. Was before my time. The man who does know is Mydon, but he won't tell you. He won't tell anyone anything![&laughs]

Id: [0x001FFC1D]
I flooded the bathhouse with cold water.

Id: [0x001FFC1E]
Good riddance!

Id: [0x001FFC58]
Finally.

Id: [0x001FFC5F]
Wow. This is big, Layla. Do you really think it’s the spear?

Id: [0x001FFC63]
This is the one. The book was almost right on top of it. I’ve never been so lucky in my life.

Id: [0x001FFC65]
OK. Let’s start her up.

Id: [0x001FFC66]
Are you sure we can trust this thing? I mean, this book could be -

Id: [0x001FFC67]
[cutting her off]Just start it, Victoria.

Id: [0x001FFC69]
You’re the boss, boss. I’ll prep it for you.

Id: [0x001FFC6F]
OK so... Worth noting. I’ve made some changes since you were last in here.

Id: [0x001FFC72]
There’s no keeping up with the tech industry these days.

Id: [0x001FFC76]
I can crank up the simulation to maximum sensory synchronization, if you’re up for it.

Id: [0x001FFC7B]
Let’s take this one step at a time.

Id: [0x001FFC7E]
Understood. If you’re looking for something a little more intense, I can always adjust the settings for you later.

Id: [0x001FFC82]
Full speed ahead. I want to see everything this baby’s got.

Id: [0x001FFC85]
Go big or go home, that’s what I always say. Let me know if it’s too intense for you - I can always change the settings later.

Id: [0x001FFC89]
This bit will let me know how much information will be fed to you during your time in the Animus.

Id: [0x001FFC8E]
Give me as much information as you’ve got. There’s no way I’m going in there without some guidance.

Id: [0x001FFC91]
Glad to help. You can always change your mind later.

Id: [0x001FFC96]
You don’t need to worry about me. I’ve got this.

Id: [0x001FFC99]
A little autonomy never killed anyone. [beat]At least, I don’t think so. Just let me know if you need assistance, and I can always add the helpers back in.

Id: [0x001FFC9C]
Listen, Layla. Before you go off -

Id: [0x001FFC9F]
[cutting her off]If this book is right, this spear, this story... It will change everything.

Id: [0x001FFCA2]
You’re putting a lot of faith in a fairly unreliable source. Historian or not, this guy wrote about magical objects and the will of the gods.

Id: [0x001FFCA5]
He’s not Homer. Herodotus was the first recorded historian, so there’s a lot more truth in that text than you think.

Id: [0x001FFCA6]
I mean, what better way is there of finding Isu artifacts than by trusting in the guy who claimed to meet an actual descendant?

Id: [0x001FFCA8]
I know but –

Id: [0x001FFCAB]
I need you to trust me. You could be right - this spear, this book, it could all be crap. But something tells me it isn’t, and I’m certainly not going to let Abstergo find out first.

Id: [0x001FFCAE]
[beat]You’re right. We haven’t got much to lose anyway. [beat]There’s just one small problem.

Id: [0x001FFCB1]
What is it?

Id: [0x001FFCB5]
This manuscript is in rough condition, to say the least. The DNA found on the spear has identified two different individuals.

Id: [0x001FFCB8]
You’re going to have to pick which strand of DNA to pursue. The choice is yours.

Id: [0x001FFCBC]
She’ll help us find what we’re looking for. I have a good feeling about this.

Id: [0x001FFCBF]
He will lead us down the right path, I’m sure.

Id: [0x001FFCC2]
All right, boss. We’re finally good to go. 431 BCE here we come!

Id: [0x001FFCC5]
The start of the Peloponnesian War.

Id: [0x001FFCC8]
Good luck in there. No pressure or anything, but we’re all depending on you.

Id: [0x001FFCCB]
Abstergo isn’t going to win this time. If what the book says is true, and we do actually find the artifact, the Assassins will finally have a chance to rise again.

Id: [0x001FFCCE]
You can do it.

Id: [0x001FFCD1]
Oh, and Victoria? Read the book. It holds the secrets I won’t be able to find on my own when I’m in there.

Id: [0x001FFCD4]
Aye aye, captain.

Id: [0x001FFCD8]
I have traveled our world all my life, from the great pyramids of Egypt to the snowy peaks of Mount Olympus...

Id: [0x001FFCDA]
[[Ancient Greek: I have read stories of gods, both great and terrible.]]

Id: [0x001FFCDC]
[[Ancient Greek: And stories of heroes who rise and fall with the coming of the tide.]]

Id: [0x001FFCDF]
[[Ancient Greek: Then, in a once-in-a-lifetime chance, you cross paths with someone who makes you question your very existence.]]

Id: [0x001FFCE2]
[[Ancient Greek: And by the gods, you walk into the life of a legend. This is the story I have been destined to tell.]]

Id: [0x001FFCF1]
Let me guess. You want me to kill him.

Id: [0x001FFCF3]
And of course, you want me to kill him.

Id: [0x001FFCF5]
And you want me to send him to the underworld.

Id: [0x001FFCF7]
So you want me to kill him?

Id: [0x001FFCF9]
So you need me to send him to Hades?

Id: [0x001FFCFE]
You want me to kill the Spartan commander.

Id: [0x001FFD00]
So you need me to take down the Spartan commander.

Id: [0x001FFD02]
And having me kill the Spartan commander would solve the problem?

Id: [0x001FFD07]
Of course. You want me to deal with the Athenian commander.

Id: [0x001FFD09]
So you'd like me to take care of the Athenian commander?

Id: [0x001FFD0B]
You want me to kill the Athenian commander.

Id: [0x001FFD2A]
You said the leader's house is near Poieessa?

Id: [0x001FFD2B]
Yes. To the south of the village.

Id: [0x001FFD2C]
It's on the east coast of the island of Keos.

Id: [0x001FFD2D]
Where is Poieessa?

Id: [0x001FFD53]
Why's the <i>miltos</i> so important?

Id: [0x001FFD5A]
Ah! What a relief it will be to go back to Keos. Sure, Xenia will be angry that I don't have the <i>miltos</i>... But I can deal with that.

Id: [0x001FFD5B]
What kind of pirate are you? It's nearly as valuable as gold!

Id: [0x001FFD61]
Clothes would do you some good.

Id: [0x001FFD63]
You're just scared - of my true form!

Id: [0x001FFD64]
[beat]But there's another matter we need to discuss.

Id: [0x001FFD6D]
This all looks so... boring.

Id: [0x001FFD6E]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x001FFD6F]
Oh, me? I was just... in the area.

Id: [0x001FFD71]
What happened to your associate?

Id: [0x001FFD72]
He had other business to attend to. Left in a hurry, so I came to meet you.

Id: [0x001FFD73]
I see.

Id: [0x001FFD74]
Did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x001FFD7A]
Here, I hope it helps.

Id: [0x001FFD7B]
You have no idea, my friend.

Id: [0x001FFD7C]
I guess I'll be paid handsomely then.

Id: [0x001FFD7E]
Before I hand over anything, I want my drachmae.

Id: [0x001FFD80]
But of course. You're a woman after my own heart, you know.

Id: [0x001FFD82]
Thanks. Here's the tablet.

Id: [0x001FFD84]
Excellent! Now we can really get to the matter at hand.

Id: [0x001FFD89]
What? You knew...

Id: [0x001FFD8A]
Not if I bring her yours first.

Id: [0x001FFD8D]
Let's see what we have here.

Id: [0x001FFD8F]
Hmm… This is interesting. The treasure is hidden in some Minoan ruins... [&ah]But it's underwater.

Id: [0x001FFD90]
I knew you wouldn't be able to resist!

Id: [0x001FFD93]
Poseidon blesses me with good fortune at last!

Id: [0x001FFD94]
So where am I going?

Id: [0x001FFD96]
Here, take this key and head to the southern tip of Keos. You'll find the entrance to the ruins there.

Id: [0x001FFD97]
It's sticky... is that blood?

Id: [0x001FFD98]
Gods no, must have been the pomegranate I ate earlier. Hurry now, time's a-wastin'.

Id: [0x001FFDE8]
I should check out the waters near the beacon[2401660].

Id: [0x001FFDEA]
My husband knows more about him than I do. Please save him, and he'll tell you anything!

Id: [0x001FFDEE]
This axe looks expensive. Useless, but expensive...

Id: [0x001FFE23]
Swordfish? You don't need to worry about him anymore. He's dead.

Id: [0x001FFE24]
He may be gone, but there will always be someone who takes advantage of the honest and the weak.

Id: [0x001FFE34]
The old man is alive. I should check the temple in Phaistos.

Id: [0x001FFE39]
The man who <i>trained</i> Deimos.

Id: [0x001FFE3B]
The Cult of Kosmos is out of control, <i>misthios</i>. Kythera is not the first to suffer their wrath.

Id: [0x001FFE3D]
I don't ask much. Hippokrates must show humility to ensure public order - prostrate himself before the gods, and declare that his skills are gods-given.

Id: [0x001FFE3E]
But that won't help his patients. It'll just take him away from his work.

Id: [0x001FFE3F]
If Hippokrates thinks he can disrupt social order to make himself into a demigod of healing...

Id: [0x001FFE45]
<i>Malákes</i> snakes. At least I got a name. Mydon.

Id: [0x001FFE4C]
Well, perhaps the gods themselves will have their revenge.

Id: [0x001FFE4D]
Me. Now step back.

Id: [0x001FFE4F]
And rewarded for his loyalty.

Id: [0x001FFE52]
It seems the gods wish me to grant you and your master another chance. Very well.

Id: [0x001FFE53]
Tell Hippokrates that if he doesn't make a public show of respect to the gods, I will raise an army of believers against him.

Id: [0x001FFE55]
If the doctor can't think of a suitable offering, his head will do.

Id: [0x001FFE5E]
He believes that beyond praying, people can take their health into their own hands and make themselves well.

Id: [0x001FFE60]
Fascinating. Can I speak with him?

Id: [0x001FFE75]
I think you're being overly paranoid. I'll come back and check on you, if I have time.

Id: [0x001FFE95]
Who was he before all this?

Id: [0x001FFE96]
Well, something's sure giving him courage now.

Id: [0x001FFE97]
Obsessive, but never threatening. He didn't stand out in symposiums until he had his drachmae act for him.

Id: [0x001FFE9D]
Me? An outlaw? You wound me.

Id: [0x001FFE9E]
This baby is yours?

Id: [0x001FFE9F]
He was dying. Chrysis had me bring a gift to Hera, so that he might be protected.

Id: [0x001FFEA0]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x001FFEA2]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! This is what's best, I promise.

Id: [0x001FFECA]
There's a great view up ahead. We'll leave our horses here.

Id: [0x001FFED4]
Have they finished with Euneas yet?

Id: [0x001FFED6]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]No, the old dog is still breathing.

Id: [0x001FFED7]
Only a matter of time until the boss or the heat breaks him.

Id: [0x001FFED8]
He'll never betray Naxos. The boss is wasting his time.

Id: [0x001FFEF5]
Trust a pirate to only help for a boat-load of drachmae.

Id: [0x001FFEFB]
A god such as I deserves more leg room!

Id: [0x001FFEFD]
I! Am! A! God! And you will return my robe to me, washed and neatly folded!

Id: [0x001FFEFF]
Imprison me if you must - but do not hurt my beloved cloak, you, you MONSTERS!

Id: [0x001FFF07]
Empedokles can lead us all to meet the gods! He knows the way! We must worship him!

Id: [0x001FFF09]
Your insults may be strong, and - and quite hurtful, but my devotion to the god Empedokles is stronger!

Id: [0x001FFF0B]
Your false god, this "Empedokles," is a delusional vegetarian. His presence, and yours, will not be tolerated.

Id: [0x001FFF0F]
Yes, inspect my flesh closely mortal! Before you stands Empedokles - A true god!

Id: [0x001FFF19]
I am a god and beyond such mortal concerns as "hunger"!

Id: [0x001FFF1A]
Do I smell lamb?

Id: [0x001FFF1B]
Animals are where punished human souls dwell. To eat a beast is to eat man himself! A disgraceful act! I cannot crave their... succulent, mouth-watering flesh. Calm! Clear your mind. Think of the elements. Earth. Wind. Fire. Water. Lamb. Ah, <i>maláka!</i>

Id: [0x001FFF21]
Do not worry for my safety, misthios - it is Empedokles who needs your help!

Id: [0x001FFF27]
Put down your blades. I offer those who follow me an audience with my brothers and sisters, the gods!

Id: [0x001FFF2B]
Gods cannot bleed! So - so you best put down your blades.

Id: [0x001FFF2F]
DO NOT STAB MY GODLY GROIN!!!

Id: [0x001FFF42]
Look upon my form, mortals! Regard my godly gifts and know the truth of my words!

Id: [0x001FFF44]
Do you see, feeble humans? I, the great Empedokles, cannot be caged! Worship me, and I offer you an audience... with the gods!

Id: [0x001FFF4B]
Purple dye might stink like rotten dog guts, but I'll be fucked if doesn't make me look like a god!<LF>

Id: [0x001FFF4C]
Technically it's made from rotten snail guts, boss.

Id: [0x001FFF4D]
...I'm wearing snail guts?

Id: [0x001FFF5A]
Do you really think Empedokles is a God?

Id: [0x001FFF5B]
I couldn't give a shit if he was a rooster - I'm just here to get away from the Priestesses.

Id: [0x001FFF62]
Praise Empedokles! Oh, oh, praise him!

Id: [0x001FFF68]
Empedokles! Empedokles! Empedokles!

Id: [0x001FFF70]
Empedokles smells exactly like a god ought to: honey, wine, and unchecked privilege!

Id: [0x001FFF75]
Our master will send for us! He - he will return and fulfil his promise.

Id: [0x001FFF7A]
Empedokles is already in the cave! He prepares the way for us!

Id: [0x001FFF87]
I hear you my brothers, my sisters!

Id: [0x001FFF89]
Someone sounds very stompy today. I'd know that temper anywhere, Ares. Do not fear brother, I shall comfort you soon!

Id: [0x001FFF8B]
Please... my family, let me come home.

Id: [0x001FFF91]
What did the gods look like, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x001FFF92]
Big. Big and angry.

Id: [0x001FFF93]
Delightful!

Id: [0x001FFF98]
I bet Empedokles is enjoying a wonderful reunion with his family.

Id: [0x001FFF9D]
I can't wait to meet Hermes! He's my favorite of Empedokles's brothers.

Id: [0x001FFFA5]
Weaklings! You cannot stop us!

Id: [0x001FFFAA]
Fucking bandits! I'll cut you all down!

Id: [0x001FFFBB]
Get me out of here. Quick, before the guards return!

Id: [0x001FFFC0]
They'll execute me! I did nothing wrong!

Id: [0x001FFFC5]
I won't die here, <i>misthios</i>. Let me out!

Id: [0x001FFFCD]
Aspasia's the one who sent me to find you.

Id: [0x001FFFEC]
Thank you. I...

Id: [0x001FFFED]
Home isn't a place, it's the people you're with. If you don't find what you're looking for, there's a place for you here.

Id: [0x001FFFEF]
She was part of your crew?

Id: [0x001FFFF0]
For a time.

Id: [0x001FFFF1]
Why did she leave?

Id: [0x001FFFF2]
Much too interested in the politics of war - a waste of a good pirate if you ask me. I haven't heard from her since she left.

Id: [0x001FFFF3]
Keos is a long way from Sparta. How did your paths cross?

Id: [0x001FFFF4]
On the sea, long ago. In her, I saw a better life. In me, she found freedom. Together, we owned the waves.

Id: [0x001FFFF5]
I can't believe she was a pirate.

Id: [0x001FFFF6]
She's the kind of woman who, once she sets her mind to something, gets it done.

Id: [0x00200001]
This is important. Where are all these people coming from anyway?

Id: [0x00200007]
But we see all kinds of mothers. They walk all day so that Hippokrates can see their children.

Id: [0x0020001C]
Ah, you are a welcome sight. Your beauty brings light into the darkness of what has become my life.

Id: [0x0020001E]
Now this is important. No one saw you come here did they?

Id: [0x0020001F]
No... Why?

Id: [0x00200020]
You're sure you weren't followed. Good, good. They're out there, though. Watching, waiting...

Id: [0x00200024]
Did Chrysis take your notes?

Id: [0x00200026]
They're closing in on me. Please help!

Id: [0x0020003D]
Or your last. We're going to take the Monger to task at the theater. I've arranged a Korinthian drama no one will forget.

Id: [0x00200044]
I'm with you. We'll put on a show.

Id: [0x00200045]
Meet me and my girls there. The public has <i>no </i>idea what spectacle they're about to witness.

Id: [0x00200047]
I agree with Brasidas. I say we take him to the Sacred Cave.

Id: [0x00200048]
And you want me to kill the bandit chief?

Id: [0x00200054]
So you want me to send her to the underworld.

Id: [0x0020005B]
And you want me to kill this mercenary.

Id: [0x00200067]
Who's this captain you keep mentioning?

Id: [0x00200068]
Gotarzes, be thankful you don't know.

Id: [0x00200069]
[&ah]The Parthenon's got more chance of staying afloat than him!

Id: [0x00200078]
Please help our daughter.

Id: [0x00200079]
Same sickness as the rest. This is very troubling.

Id: [0x0020007E]
You... you knew my mater?

Id: [0x00200099]
The pleasure is all mine.

Id: [0x0020009A]
He deserved all of it.

Id: [0x002000A3]
There's more to him than meets the eye.

Id: [0x002000A4]
He knew you could save Korinth from that beast.

Id: [0x002000A8]
[beat]Let's talk.

Id: [0x002000AF]
Yes, Myrrine.

Id: [0x002000B0]
I remember that part of her well.

Id: [0x002000B1]
A strong woman with great intensity. She wanted to find her place here in Korinth, but never found what she was looking for.

Id: [0x002000B2]
You speak of her kindly. You were her friend.

Id: [0x002000B3]
Perhaps on the surface. But she had a great pain in the middle of her that no one could get to.

Id: [0x002000B7]
This is where you ask me to kill the leader.

Id: [0x002000BC]
You want me to cut this spy's throat?

Id: [0x002000C7]
Nothing. Speaking of Sparta only brought her misery. It's like a part of her was missing.

Id: [0x002000D0]
Did she find work?

Id: [0x002000D1]
She kept to herself - with one eye always on the port.

Id: [0x002000D2]
She could have stayed with us. But I think she was looking for something else.

Id: [0x002000D7]
How did you come to know her?

Id: [0x002000D8]
There was so much rain that night... I saw her sleeping in the streets and gave her shelter.

Id: [0x002000D9]
She was a vagrant? [beat]I wonder what my father'd think of that.

Id: [0x002000DA]
I didn't know what happened to her. All she told me was that she'd left the place that tore her apart. Sparta.

Id: [0x002000ED]
You want me to hunt and kill the beast.

Id: [0x00200105]
After Korinth - where did she go?

Id: [0x00200106]
That, I don't know.

Id: [0x00200107]
She must have given you <i>some </i>hint.

Id: [0x00200108]
I don't think even <i>she</i> knew where she was headed. All I know is she won a ship thanks to a lucky dice throw.

Id: [0x0020010D]
Tyche owed her that much, at least. I remember the ship's name well - Siren Song.

Id: [0x00200110]
So do I.

Id: [0x002001A3]
As for you, Kassandra, I owe you information. We'll talk about your mother. Just not here.

Id: [0x002001AD]
I'll flush them out.

Id: [0x002001B0]
You have my thanks, High Priestess.

Id: [0x00200482]
He's a man with many faces, but hopefully this will help you.

Id: [0x002004A2]
That doesn't sound like a problem.

Id: [0x002004A3]
It wasn't, until the Spartans heard about it! I just got word they're going to attack me.

Id: [0x002004AC]
Your plan seemed to work. The Monger's thugs ambushed me.

Id: [0x002004B0]
Brasidas is worried about the anarchy that could follow the Monger's death. He wants him dead, but wants it done quietly.

Id: [0x002004B1]
That man is a long way from Sparta. This is Korinthia, so we'll do it the Korinthian way.

Id: [0x002004D0]
It's blood. Lots of it.

Id: [0x002004D9]
[&scream]You fucking snake![/&scream]

Id: [0x002004E4]
Can I come?

Id: [0x002004E5]
As long as you're quiet.

Id: [0x002004FA]
Who's that?

Id: [0x002004FB]
She's my mother.

Id: [0x002004FC]
Your mother? You don't <i>have </i>a mother! Markos told me <i>he </i>raised you!

Id: [0x002004FD]
What did I tell you about talking?

Id: [0x002004FE]
You better be telling the truth! Kassandra can get <i>really </i>mad.

Id: [0x002004FF]
And you can always trust Kassandra!

Id: [0x00200501]
Why don't you go play, Phoibe? Let me and Anthousa talk.

Id: [0x00200502]
If you say so.

Id: [0x00200507]
Kill you? He said you worked with orphans. That's why I'm here.

Id: [0x00200508]
That was long ago. Now I'm just a farmer.

Id: [0x0020050D]
What was all that noise?!

Id: [0x0020050E]
Damalis doesn't have to worry about her client now.

Id: [0x0020050F]
That wasn't what she wanted you to do!

Id: [0x00200510]
I dealt with him, didn't I?

Id: [0x0020052B]
Well... At least I could sneak in OK. Look!

Id: [0x00200558]
I should hurry back and check on Dolops.

Id: [0x00200576]
Is there something else you need, <i>misthios?</i>

Id: [0x0020057B]
Please, take this. You might find it useful.

Id: [0x0020057C]
She would take the children and teach them terrible things - turn them into spies and even soldiers. I couldn't take it anymore and left.

Id: [0x0020057F]
You've done your duty to Hera. I'll deal with Chrysis.

Id: [0x00200583]
By Hades! The killer must have been waiting for me to leave. [&ah]I hope Dolops left some sign of his days as a priest, or this has all been for nothing.

Id: [0x00200587]
What's this? A letter. "Chrysis, you cannot keep taking children to the Altar of Apollo Maleatas. It is not the gods who condemn them, but you. I will take this to the authorities if you don't stop. Your son, Dolops."

Id: [0x002005A9]
That's what this patient has. He's losing control of his limbs and throat - sometimes frothing at the mouth. I fear his breathing will stop next.

Id: [0x002005AA]
What was so interesting about these notes?

Id: [0x002005AB]
They were my notes about diseases of the mind, including what the priests call the "Sacred Disease."

Id: [0x002005AD]
The champion returns.

Id: [0x002005AF]
We do have unfinished business.

Id: [0x002005B0]
The training... or the company?

Id: [0x002005B6]
We've been having so much fun.

Id: [0x002005B9]
I want to finish this training - that's it.

Id: [0x002005BA]
All business, eh champion? You need to loosen up once in a while.

Id: [0x002005BB]
Maybe after this next challenge.

Id: [0x002005BD]
We're going to have a foot race. First one to the high point on the island wins.

Id: [0x002005C0]
Fighting each other... Killing wolves...

Id: [0x002005C1]
Go on...

Id: [0x002005C3]
I think you'll like this next challenge.

Id: [0x002005C4]
Yes?

Id: [0x002005C6]
The last part of training is a race?

Id: [0x002005C7]
The Battle of One Hundred Hands is about skill, strength, and most of all, <i>endurance</i>. A tired competitor is an easy target for someone with stamina. I make regular offerings to Hermes to stay fast.

Id: [0x002005C8]
And if I win this race, what will I get?

Id: [0x002005C9]
Bragging rights alone.

Id: [0x002005CA]
Great.

Id: [0x002005CB]
It's not the result you should be after, it's the training. After this you will be ready to enter the Battle of One Hundred Hands. I will vouch for you, and you will vouch for me.

Id: [0x002005CC]
I'm ready. You said race to the high point -

Id: [0x002005CE]
Yes! The plateau on the other side of town. When I say go, the race is on. Three... Two... One...

Id: [0x002005D3]
You won't be allowed in the Battle of One Hundred Hands if you don't race me.

Id: [0x002005D4]
Understood.

Id: [0x002005D6]
Look who's back. Ready to race me?

Id: [0x00200624]
Leave me, champion.

Id: [0x00200627]
Come on, you worms. I need to work harder if I'm going to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands. I need a professional. A <i>real</i> champion.

Id: [0x00200628]
Lucky for you, a "champion" has arrived. Drakios sent me to train with you.

Id: [0x00200629]
Interesting. I need to practice with another competitor to officially enter.

Id: [0x0020062A]
These men look like they need a doctor.

Id: [0x0020062B]
They're lousy sparring partners, every last one. I need professionals to practice with before the Battle of One Hundred Hands. I need a champion.

Id: [0x0020062C]
Maybe your "champion" has arrived.

Id: [0x0020062D]
Is that right? If you're serious, I'm a sanctioned competitor in the Battle. You practice with me, and Drakios will let both of us officially enter.

Id: [0x0020062F]
The Battle of One Hundred Hands is the most grueling contest in the Greek world. The body count is high, and the chance of success low. Are you sure that's something you want to train for?

Id: [0x00200632]
Killing's what I do, and I do it well.

Id: [0x00200633]
You have the right attitude, I'll give you that. But you can't simply power your way to victory in the Battle of One Hundred Hands. It takes preparation.

Id: [0x00200636]
This battle -

Id: [0x00200638]
I'm prepared to work hard. The rest lies with the Fates.

Id: [0x00200639]
Humility is a fine trait in a warrior - as long as it's hiding true ferocity below the surface. That's what's needed in the Battle.

Id: [0x0020063A]
He's usually in the town on Melos - doesn't go far.

Id: [0x0020063B]
If this battle is so difficult, why enter it at all?

Id: [0x0020063C]
I'm not from a family of means, champion, and have always dreamed about the Hundred-Hands purse. My father, my brother tried to win it years ago. Even my mother entered last time, and now they're all gone. Dead.

Id: [0x0020063D]
Let's say I want to fight in the Battle of One Hundred Hands...

Id: [0x0020063E]
Then fight me and prove you are a worthy training companion.

Id: [0x0020063F]
If the battle's so hard, why do you think you'll win?

Id: [0x00200640]
I train at all hours until my body gives out. Before bed I make offerings to Ares. I wake in the night to strategize. And then... I rise in the morning to do it all again.

Id: [0x00200642]
For all to see him as he really is.

Id: [0x00200647]
You asked for it.

Id: [0x0020064D]
Real champions make time.

Id: [0x00200651]
Come on, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00200654]
Are you even trying?

Id: [0x00200655]
You need to push me!

Id: [0x0020065C]
It seems you <i>are</i> the champion I've been looking for. A real Spartan, if I'm right.

Id: [0x0020065D]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0020065E]
I have other things to attend to first.

Id: [0x00200660]
Next on the agenda is archery training. Are you ready?

Id: [0x00200663]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x00200664]
So eager! Well, a shipment of wolves has wrecked on shore nearby. They were meant to be part of the Battle, but now they're our practice targets.

Id: [0x00200665]
Let's go hunting.

Id: [0x00200667]
When you're ready, there's a shipwreck on the north coast of the island. Meet me there.

Id: [0x00200677]
We're a safe distance here. Now shoot these cursed wolves before they start taking down the local children.

Id: [0x00200679]
You came! Good. We can get on with the training.

Id: [0x0020067A]
You said we'd be doing archery... but I don't see any targets.

Id: [0x0020067B]
A ship wrecked here not long ago. It carried a pack of wolves to Melos as an added challenge to the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x0020067C]
And now they're running loose here on Hydrea?

Id: [0x0020067D]
Not for long.

Id: [0x0020067E]
Have you decided to do some wolf hunting?

Id: [0x0020067F]
On with the hunt - I can always use more pelts.

Id: [0x00200680]
A true champion. I knew it! Ready your bow.

Id: [0x00200682]
I have other priorities.

Id: [0x00200683]
That's fine. I'm sure it's no matter if these wolves eat a Hydrean child or two.

Id: [0x00200688]
How'd you like that one?

Id: [0x00200689]
Beautiful shot.

Id: [0x0020068B]
The way your muscles ripple when you draw the string -

Id: [0x0020068C]
Do they ripple?

Id: [0x0020068D]
Do they <i>ripple.</i>

Id: [0x0020068E]
They're works of art!

Id: [0x00200690]
Another kill. Keep it up.

Id: [0x00200695]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x00200697]
This is supposed to be archery training!

Id: [0x00200698]
Do you want the wolves killed, or not?

Id: [0x00200699]
Yes. Kill them.

Id: [0x002006A7]
It's done. All the wolves are dead.

Id: [0x002006A8]
You elevate archery to an art form. Even Sophokles couldn't captivate me like that.

Id: [0x002006AA]
Not exactly the archery training I was hoping for.

Id: [0x002006AD]
The wolves are dead. That's what matters.

Id: [0x002006AE]
If you say so.

Id: [0x002006AF]
How much more "<i>training" </i>will we do before I can enter the Battle?

Id: [0x002006B0]
What, you don't want to spend more time with me?

Id: [0x002006B5]
I have other things to do. People to kill.

Id: [0x002006B8]
Then you'll be happy to know we only have one last step in our training regimen.

Id: [0x002006B9]
Where to?

Id: [0x002006BD]
This time with you has been -

Id: [0x002006BF]
I don't know what to say.

Id: [0x002006C0]
Say no more. In a strange way, I see my own reflection in you.

Id: [0x002006C1]
Yes. We've only just met and yet, we have a... connection.

Id: [0x002006C2]
There's one more step to our training.

Id: [0x002006C3]
We'll do it another time.

Id: [0x002006C4]
I'll be waiting. Meet me at my house, near the spring.

Id: [0x002006CB]
Not another word out of you, <i>maláka</i>!

Id: [0x002006CC]
I have orders. Everyone who talks about Swordfish must die!

Id: [0x002006D1]
Shall we continue?

Id: [0x002006D2]
Don't touch that chest! It's mine!

Id: [0x002006D8]
I'm no thief, but if I was -

Id: [0x002006DA]
Feeling brave, are you?

Id: [0x0020078E]
It's good to see you too, Phidias.

Id: [0x00200791]
She has birthmarks on her arm that form the constellation Aquila.

Id: [0x00200792]
Now that is something I can work with. Just who exactly is this woman?

Id: [0x00200799]
Thank you. Knowingly or not, you've just saved my life.

Id: [0x0020079A]
And was it worth saving?

Id: [0x0020079C]
We'd better get you to my ship then.

Id: [0x002007A5]
Get me back to Keos, and I'll pay you handsomely.

Id: [0x0020081E]
Very well.

Id: [0x00200835]
Speaking of adventure, I have a task for <i>you</i>, dear Phoibe.

Id: [0x00200836]
An adventure? Yes!

Id: [0x00200837]
Already following in your footsteps, isn't she, my friend?

Id: [0x0020083D]
Not an easy choice, <i>misthios</i>. But it's been made.

Id: [0x0020083F]
You seem to fit that description.

Id: [0x0020085B]
And you want me to slay him.

Id: [0x0020085D]
And you need me to gut him.

Id: [0x0020085F]
And you need a <i>misthios</i> to kill him.

Id: [0x00200861]
You want me to kill him.

Id: [0x00200863]
You want me to run my blade through his skull.

Id: [0x00200865]
So you need a mercenary to kill him.

Id: [0x00200867]
And let me guess, you want me to kill him.

Id: [0x00200869]
And you want me to send him to the Ferryman.

Id: [0x0020086B]
So you want me to hunt and kill this beast?

Id: [0x0020086D]
You want me to kill this animal, then?

Id: [0x0020086F]
So you're asking me to slay this creature.

Id: [0x00200871]
So you need me to kill the beast.

Id: [0x00200873]
You want me to slay this beast.

Id: [0x00200875]
So you want me to kill this creature.

Id: [0x0020087D]
So you want me to take her out.

Id: [0x0020087F]
Sounds like you need a <i>misthios</i> to end her life.

Id: [0x00200881]
So you want me to make her disappear.

Id: [0x00200883]
And you want me to strike her down.

Id: [0x00200885]
And you want me to take care of this woman.

Id: [0x00200887]
You want me to give her a taste of my blade.

Id: [0x00200889]
You want me to kill her?

Id: [0x0020088B]
I should send her to Hades, then?

Id: [0x00200895]
Let me guess - you need me to kill the Spartan commander?

Id: [0x00200897]
So you want me to send the Spartan commander to Hades.

Id: [0x002008E7]
Sounds like you're asking me to kill the Athenian commander.

Id: [0x002008E9]
And you want me to crush the bandit chief.

Id: [0x002008EB]
You want me to gut the bandit chief?

Id: [0x002008ED]
And you want me to take out the bandit chief?

Id: [0x002008EF]
You want me to kill the scum leading these bandits.

Id: [0x002008F1]
And you'd like me to take care of the bandit chief.

Id: [0x002008FF]
So you need me to kill this <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00200901]
You want me to send this mercenary to Hades?

Id: [0x00200903]
You need me to take out this <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00200905]
Let me guess - you need me to kill this mercenary?

Id: [0x0020090E]
So you want me to kill this leader?

Id: [0x00200910]
All you’re asking is that I take care of the leader?

Id: [0x00200911]
So you want me to send the leader to Hades?

Id: [0x00200913]
And you want me to kill this leader.

Id: [0x0020094A]
So you're asking me to kill the spy?

Id: [0x0020094B]
Let me guess... You want me to send the spy to Hades.

Id: [0x00200951]
So you want me to make this deserter regret running?

Id: [0x00200953]
You want me to make an example of this deserter.

Id: [0x00200955]
So you want me to track and kill this deserter.

Id: [0x00200959]
And you want me to kill the thief.

Id: [0x0020095B]
So you want me to gut this thief?

Id: [0x0020095D]
So you need me to send this thief to the Ferryman?

Id: [0x00200963]
You're asking me to slay the lion?

Id: [0x00200965]
I take it you want me to kill this bear?

Id: [0x00200968]
Let me guess... You want me to kill the wolf.

Id: [0x0020096A]
You want me to hunt and kill this wolf, then?

Id: [0x0020096C]
Sounds like you want me to kill the wolf.

Id: [0x0020096E]
So you want me to kill the shark.

Id: [0x00200972]
So you want me to kill the lion.

Id: [0x00200974]
You want me to slay the lion, don't you?

Id: [0x00200978]
So you want me to kill the bear.

Id: [0x0020097A]
So you’d like me to take care of the bear for you.

Id: [0x0020097E]
You want me to gut the shark.

Id: [0x00200980]
You're asking me to hunt and kill the shark?

Id: [0x00200982]
Sounds like it's time to go fishing... For a shark.

Id: [0x00200989]
Who's after you?

Id: [0x0020098A]
The Cult of Kosmos. Remember Athens? They never stopped hunting me, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00200A70]
I have some questions for you.

Id: [0x00200A79]
I know who did it.

Id: [0x00200AA5]
And of course, you want me to kill them all.

Id: [0x00200AA7]
And you want me to send them all to Hades.

Id: [0x00200AA9]
Let me guess, you want me to kill them all?

Id: [0x00200AAB]
And you want me to wipe them all out?

Id: [0x00200AAD]
So should I strike them all down?

Id: [0x00200AAF]
This is where you ask me to take care of them.

Id: [0x00200AB1]
So I should crush them all.

Id: [0x00200AB3]
You want me to kill every last one of them.

Id: [0x00200AB5]
So I should send them all to the underworld?

Id: [0x00200ADE]
So you want me to kill all the pirates.

Id: [0x00200AE0]
And you want me to kill all the bandits.

Id: [0x00200AE2]

Id: [0x00200AE6]
And you want me to kill all the Athenians.

Id: [0x00200AE8]

Id: [0x00200AEA]
You want me to find and execute the deserters.

Id: [0x00200AEC]
You want me to make an example of the Athenian deserters.

Id: [0x00200AEE]
You're asking me to kill all the Spartan deserters?

Id: [0x00200AF2]
You want me to kill a pack of wolves.

Id: [0x00200AF6]
I need your help.

Id: [0x00200AF8]
Why would they be after you now?

Id: [0x00200AF9]
They want me dead. Moving me here has only bought a little more time.

Id: [0x00200AFF]
You want me to kill all the lions.

Id: [0x00200B03]
You want me to find and slay all the bears?

Id: [0x00200B07]
So I should kill all the sharks.

Id: [0x00200B10]
Are you asking me to kill goats?

Id: [0x00200B51]
There'll be time.

Id: [0x00200B52]
But the weave of my life is unraveling. I need your help if I'm to stop it.

Id: [0x00200B53]
You're safe here.

Id: [0x00200B54]
Ah, my beautiful innocent. If only the gods would allow me time to grant you immortality in bronze.

Id: [0x00200B5E]
So you want me to hunt all the beasts.

Id: [0x00200B62]
Are you asking me to slay all the animals?

Id: [0x00200B64]
You want me to spill the beasts' blood.

Id: [0x00200B66]
Sounds like you want me to kill the beasts.

Id: [0x00200B76]
You want me to kill all the pirates?

Id: [0x00200B78]
And you're asking me to gut all the pirates.

Id: [0x00200B7C]
OK. If it'll put your mind at rest, I'll help.

Id: [0x00200B7D]
As much as I adore seeing you, I need you to find that message at the Temple of Zeus for me.

Id: [0x00200B91]
The other day I received a <i>scytale</i>, and a note.

Id: [0x00200BA0]
What sort of services?

Id: [0x00200BA1]
I'm an apothecary. I can make poisons. Cast spells on enemies. I have a list of services here - I just need someone to take it to the right people.

Id: [0x00200BA3]
So you want me to gut every single bandit.

Id: [0x00200BA5]
And you’re hoping I’ll kill all the bandits?

Id: [0x00200BAC]
So you want me to kill all the Spartans?

Id: [0x00200BAE]
Let me guess. You want me to send all the Spartans to Hades.

Id: [0x00200BB9]
I hope you're not asking me to volunteer.

Id: [0x00200BBA]
Oh no! You're alive. I need corpses. You look like someone who could provide them. And this area's full of soldiers... raiders... bandits. You know, specimens.

Id: [0x00200BBD]
You're asking me to run my blade through every soldier.

Id: [0x00200BBF]
And you want me to take down these soldiers.

Id: [0x00200BC3]
Someone left you a piece of wood and a letter... I can see why you're frightened.

Id: [0x00200BC4]
It's not just any stick! The scytale is used by the Spartans to send coded messages.

Id: [0x00200BC7]
You want me to take care of the spies.

Id: [0x00200BCA]
So you need me to track and kill the deserters?

Id: [0x00200BCD]
What did the message say?

Id: [0x00200BCE]
Look to your art... The king of gods has a message to impart.

Id: [0x00200BCF]
Fantastic, that's not a message. It's barely passable as a riddle!

Id: [0x00200BD0]
So you need me to kill all the Athenian deserters.

Id: [0x00200BD5]
You want me to kill the Spartan deserters for their dishonor.

Id: [0x00200BD8]
Let me guess, you want me to hunt the wolves?

Id: [0x00200BDB]
It's obvious, the king of gods.

Id: [0x00200BDC]
Zeus?

Id: [0x00200BDD]
Yes, and what am I?

Id: [0x00200BDE]
And you want me to gut all the sharks?

Id: [0x00200BE1]
So... you want me to kill a bunch of goats?

Id: [0x00200BE3]
And you expect me to butcher some goats?

Id: [0x00200BE7]
There's so many answers to that, but [&ah]I suppose you're a sculptor.

Id: [0x00200BE8]
Exactly!

Id: [0x00200BE9]
So where do I need to go?

Id: [0x00200BEA]
The Temple of Zeus, of course! It's here in Olympia. The clue for the scytale should be around the statue.

Id: [0x00200BEB]
OK, so let's talk about your stick.

Id: [0x00200BEC]
I need to get the code. Then I'll show you how it works.

Id: [0x00200C43]
I could bring that to Hippokrates.

Id: [0x00200C44]
Really?

Id: [0x00200C64]
They come from everywhere, but this is mostly overflow from the Sanctuary of Asklepios. It's been crowded there since the war began. And with crowding comes sickness...

Id: [0x00200C65]
The outskirts are vast. Can you be more specific about the location of the bull?

Id: [0x00200C66]
Last I heard it was grazing on Mount Koryphum, near the Asine Ruins.

Id: [0x00200C67]
I'll find this bull for you.

Id: [0x00200CA9]
You... monster! Help!

Id: [0x00200CAB]
Time to bring you back to Hippokrates's camp.

Id: [0x00200CB3]
If you're just going to slit its throat, why do you need the bull alive?

Id: [0x00200CB4]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]But we're not just going to slit its throat.

Id: [0x00200CC4]
I couldn't bring it back alive, but I did manage to collect its heart.

Id: [0x00200CC6]
[&breath][sighs][/&breath]This won't be enough to please Asklepios. The beast died unwillingly, and with just the heart, we'll only be able to pray for one life.

Id: [0x00200CC8]
Please, <i>misthios</i>. The white bull you killed was mine. My farm feeds half of Argolis. If I die, people will starve.

Id: [0x00200CC9]
I beg you! My husband was killed by this sickness. I have two small children. Who will take care of them if I die? I am wealthy, and will pay you for this blessing.

Id: [0x00200CCA]
[&cough][coughs][/&cough]It's OK, give the sacrifice to them.

Id: [0x00200CCB]
You did this. You choose whose prayers get heard by the gods.

Id: [0x00200CD6]
So you want me to destroy it.

Id: [0x00200CD9]
So you want me to destroy them.

Id: [0x00200CDC]
You're saying you want me to destroy it.

Id: [0x00200CDE]
You want me to find and destroy it.

Id: [0x00200CE0]
So I must find and destroy it?

Id: [0x00200CE2]
Doesn't look like he died "willingly." I'll take his heart for the sacrifice - it'll have to do.

Id: [0x00200CF3]
So you want me to sink this ship.

Id: [0x00200CF6]
You want me to destroy an Athenian ship?

Id: [0x00200CFA]
So you want me to destroy this Spartan ship?

Id: [0x00200CFE]
You’re asking me to destroy a merchant’s boat?

Id: [0x00200D02]
You'd like me to sink all the ships.

Id: [0x00200D05]
So I have to sink the Athenian fleet.

Id: [0x00200D09]
So you want me to sink the Spartan ships.

Id: [0x00200D0D]
You want me to destroy all the pirate ships.

Id: [0x00200D11]
So you're asking me to sink all the merchant ships.

Id: [0x00200D15]
And you want me to destroy all the food supplies.

Id: [0x00200D19]
You need me to destroy the military supplies?

Id: [0x00200D1D]
And you want me to destroy the supplies.

Id: [0x00200D28]
My mother was a fool to trust any of you. I'm going to find Chrysis, and she's going to pay for what she's done.

Id: [0x00200D2B]
How did you come to work with Chrysis?

Id: [0x00200D2C]
I didn't have a choice. She's my mother.

Id: [0x00200D2E]
Chrysis kept you a secret.

Id: [0x00200D2F]
My birth brought shame to her. I could never redeem that.

Id: [0x00200D33]
Where do you think Chrysis is now?

Id: [0x00200D34]
I can't be sure. But she used to pray at the Altar of Apollo Maleatas. That's where she decided which children to train and which to let die.

Id: [0x00200D35]
What was Chrysis doing that was so terrible?

Id: [0x00200D38]
So she did. Where did you last see her?

Id: [0x00200D39]
In the woods near the Sanctuary of Asklepios, but that was many years ago.

Id: [0x00200D3B]
So she did see the Oracle! Yes, Chrysis spoke of building an army with a champion at its head. It must have been for her associates... the masked ones.

Id: [0x00200D44]
So Chrysis is the key to finding my <i>mater</i>. I must find this Altar of Apollo Maleatas.

Id: [0x00200D49]
There's the statue of Apollo -[&ahem] and the altar. [&ahem]Chrysis will find a lot more than a helpless infant waiting for her.

Id: [0x00200D4D]
Hurry! This patient doesn't have much time left.

Id: [0x00200D51]
Come with me. You've had a busy day.

Id: [0x00200D56]
The importance of diet to maintaining one's health cannot be overstated.

Id: [0x00200D57]
What good can one apple really do?

Id: [0x00200D58]
[&laughs][laughing to himself][/&laughs]Well, taken daily, they can keep the doctor away.

Id: [0x00200D5D]
But... to more serious matters. I know why you're here. You're looking for your mother.

Id: [0x00200D5F]
I never said -

Id: [0x00200D60]
I see the resemblance. The apple does not fall far from the tree.

Id: [0x00200D62]
Kassandra of Sparta.

Id: [0x00200D63]
Well met, Kassandra of Sparta. What do you need?

Id: [0x00200D64]
Kassandra of Sparta.

Id: [0x00200D65]
What did you come here for, Kassandra of Sparta?

Id: [0x00200D67]
You remember her?

Id: [0x00200D68]
I was young then - I didn't know how to help. I turned her away. But her look of determination and despair was burned into my mind. It has never left me and it never will.

Id: [0x00200D69]
After, I swore to Apollo that I wouldn't turn away another patient - that I'd dedicate my life to the cause. She made an impression on me, your brave mother did.

Id: [0x00200D6A]
She would be happy to know that.

Id: [0x00200D6B]
Thank you for everything, Hippokrates. I'll go see him now.

Id: [0x00200D78]
Come with me. We should talk.

Id: [0x00200D7B]
What do you know of family? You take children from their mothers and silence anyone who gets in your way.

Id: [0x00200D7C]
Silence? Mydon chose to slice off his own cursed tongue.

Id: [0x00200D7D]
I'm talking about Dolops, the one your Cultist puppets tried to kill.

Id: [0x00200D84]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]I should have killed that idiot son of mine years ago.

Id: [0x00200D85]
Your own son!

Id: [0x00200D86]
Dolops turned his back on me the night I rescued your brother. He was too stupid to see the child's destiny was intertwined with my own.

Id: [0x00200D8A]
Go in good health, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00200D91]
I know something that may help you find her. [beat]I swore I would never tell anyone about Dolops and his past, but I owe this to your mother.

Id: [0x00200D92]
Who's Dolops?

Id: [0x00200D93]
He was a priest who dedicated his life to helping orphans. It's possible he remembers that night, long ago. Maybe he would know something about your mother and her child.

Id: [0x00200D94]
I'll go see this man. Thank you, Hippokrates.

Id: [0x00200DD3]
[&ah]You’re fast, even with all that gear.

Id: [0x00200DD6]
[&ah]Not fast enough.[&ah]

Id: [0x00200DD7]
[&phew]So it seems.

Id: [0x00200DDA]
It's easy to forget how beautiful it is here.

Id: [0x00200DDB]
When you’re training so hard, you mean?

Id: [0x00200DE1]
I’m trying to restore balance to my life, and to the Greek world. To find closure.

Id: [0x00200DE2]
What makes you think that?

Id: [0x00200DE3]
Call it a hunch.

Id: [0x00200DE5]
All this training leaves no time for fun.

Id: [0x00200DE7]
I can tell you're holding something back.

Id: [0x00200DE8]
...Maybe.

Id: [0x00200DEA]
I come up here to remind myself to live in the moment.

Id: [0x00200DEC]
I can see how that might work.

Id: [0x00200DF5]
I'm telling you, he was never fully dressed. And some people on Kythera built a statue to this man.

Id: [0x00200DF6]
<i>Malákas</i> Empedokles.

Id: [0x00200DF7]
What became of him?

Id: [0x00200DFA]
If you told Barnabas there was a sea monster living in your ear, he’d believe you.

Id: [0x00200DFB]
He sounds like a real dimwit.

Id: [0x00200DFC]
Actually, he’s one of the most genuine people I’ve ever met.

Id: [0x00200E00]
At the Battle we may have to fight each other. And only one of us will survive.

Id: [0x00200E06]
I thought you came up here to live in the moment?

Id: [0x00200E08]
How's this for in the moment?

Id: [0x00200E0A]
I’ve killed more soldiers, mercenaries, and masked men than I can remember. The day of the Battle will be like any other for me.

Id: [0x00200E0B]
You don’t know what I’m capable of. You don’t know how different it will be from my average day.

Id: [0x00200E0C]
I know one way it'll differ.

Id: [0x00200E0D]
How's that?

Id: [0x00200E0E]
It will be shorter.

Id: [0x00200E14]
Let's make it more than a moment.

Id: [0x00200E17]
Must you wear so many layers?

Id: [0x00200E1A]
I’m sorry, Roxana. I don’t want to do this.

Id: [0x00200E1C]
You’re right. Getting closer could mean a half second’s hesitation before killing you... You’re tough, I know that.

Id: [0x00200E1D]
I can't give up any edge.

Id: [0x00200E20]
It was good to meet you, Roxana, but it's time to get back to the real world. Good luck in the Battle.

Id: [0x00200E22]
You too, champion.

Id: [0x00200E26]
I guess this is goodbye. Until the Battle, I mean.

Id: [0x00200E27]
Let's not make this difficult.

Id: [0x00200E28]
I can't help thinking... we don't have to cross swords.

Id: [0x00200E29]
You could skip the Battle as easy as I can. But you won't.

Id: [0x00200E2A]
You're right.

Id: [0x00200E2C]
Goodbye, Roxana.

Id: [0x00200E3C]
Along the shore! It's the missing ship.

Id: [0x00200E47]
It's been too long! What will I do?

Id: [0x00200E49]
You said Galarnos was sailing from Makedonia. Is there anywhere else he might dock?

Id: [0x00200E4A]
Nowhere. The recent storms must've caught him. If they were close enough to the island, they might've been forced into a bay. I'd check the coast.

Id: [0x00200E4E]
I better check Stormfall Bay to the northwest.

Id: [0x00200E54]
Hopefully the sea will reveal more than you've given me to go on.

Id: [0x00200E55]
I thank you for doing this, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00200E67]
Help! Someone please help me! <LF>

Id: [0x00200E6C]
Thank you for avenging my husband.

Id: [0x00200E81]
I grew up here. I know everyone who lives here. Please, I don't want them to die.

Id: [0x00200E82]
What happened? Start at the beginning.

Id: [0x00200E88]
So, what was the message? Did it give you the information you were looking for?

Id: [0x00200E89]
In a manner of speaking… The message you gave me, I wrapped it around the rod.

Id: [0x00200E8A]
Yes, the scytale! It's ingenious, the right message for the right rod. Wrap the cloth around it, and the letters should align, giving you the message.

Id: [0x00200E8B]
Yes, very interesting. But what did it say?

Id: [0x00200EA1]
If I'm going to pay her, I need to find some work on this island.

Id: [0x00200EA8]
You need me and my crew to sink this ship?

Id: [0x00200EAA]
You want me to send this ship to the seafloor.

Id: [0x00200EAC]
So I set sail and sink it?

Id: [0x00200EB1]
So I should sink an Athenian ship?

Id: [0x00200EBE]
You want me to sink the Spartan ship.

Id: [0x00200EC3]
So I destroy the merchant ship, and your problems disappear.

Id: [0x00200EC8]
You're saying you want me to destroy them.

Id: [0x00200ECA]
You want me to find and destroy them.

Id: [0x00200ECC]
So I must find and destroy them?

Id: [0x00200ED1]
You want me to destroy all the ships?

Id: [0x00200ED3]
So you want me to destroy all the boats.

Id: [0x00200ED5]
You want me to sink all the ships.

Id: [0x00200EDE]
Sounds like I need to sink some pirate ships.

Id: [0x00200F8F]
It's directions!

Id: [0x00200F94]
Phidias is paranoid, but maybe it's not all in his mind...

Id: [0x00200F96]
What happened to the crew?

Id: [0x00200F9B]
This must be what Phidias was looking for.

Id: [0x00200FA1]
I should get back to Phidias so he can decipher the message.

Id: [0x00201033]
Wha... What do you want? Who are you?

Id: [0x00201034]
I'm the one who's going to return the tablet you stole.

Id: [0x00201039]
Give it to me, I'm not leaving without it.

Id: [0x0020103A]
There's no winners in this war, but there are opportunities. Perhaps we could come to an arrangement?

Id: [0x0020103C]
Why did you steal the tablet?

Id: [0x0020103D]
Because I was paid to.

Id: [0x0020103E]
Who paid you?

Id: [0x0020103F]
A mercenary. Hyrkanos, all right? Gave me the Spartan uniform, told me where to look. Easy drachmae.

Id: [0x00201041]
How did you get into the camp?

Id: [0x00201042]
[Chortle turns to cough] Spartans never suspect their own... Too busy looking down on the rest of us. <i>Malákes</i>!

Id: [0x00201049]
What arrangement would that be?

Id: [0x0020104A]
Here, take the tablet... and this for your troubles.

Id: [0x0020104C]
No one knows who I am. Nobody else needs to die here.

Id: [0x0020104D]
Go... Make sure I never see your face again.

Id: [0x00201053]
Give me the tablet, or I will cut you down.

Id: [0x00201054]
I can't fight you. Here, take the tablet.

Id: [0x00201057]
I'll take the tablet now.

Id: [0x00201058]
Like fuck you will.

Id: [0x00201059]
Then only one of us will be getting paid today.

Id: [0x0020105B]
I put my bag down for a moment, and when I woke up again - I mean, when I next looked - it was gone.

Id: [0x0020105C]
What's in this bag?

Id: [0x0020105D]
It had all my poisons in it. Not just local herbs - some very rare stuff from Egypt, too.

Id: [0x0020106A]
By doing what?

Id: [0x0020106B]
Every group that passes through is killing them! If it's not the soldiers doing it for sport, it's the bandits doing it for food!

Id: [0x0020106C]
You're late, very late! It's a good thing Deimos hasn't arrived yet.

Id: [0x0020106D]
Sorry. It's my, er - first time.

Id: [0x0020106E]
A new recruit? Welcome, welcome.

Id: [0x0020107A]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0020107B]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0020107C]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x002010A7]
So you’ve seen it too, then?

Id: [0x002010A9]
It’s beautiful isn’t it?

Id: [0x002010B3]
You want me to find her and set her free?

Id: [0x002010B9]
Do you want me to set him free?

Id: [0x002010BF]
You want me to find him and set him free.

Id: [0x002010C9]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x002010CC]
KASSANDRA!

Id: [0x002010CE]
...A storm is coming...

Id: [0x002010D0]
So you want me to free him?

Id: [0x002010D2]
You want me to rescue him.

Id: [0x002010D7]
[&scream]Kassandra?[/&scream]

Id: [0x002010D8]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x002010D9]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x002010DD]
So you want me to rescue her.

Id: [0x002010DF]
You want me to set her free.

Id: [0x002010E1]
So you need me to free her.

Id: [0x002010F7]
So you want me to take it from the bandits.

Id: [0x002010FF]
So you want me to take it from the soldiers.

Id: [0x00201102]
So you want me to take it from the Spartans.

Id: [0x00201106]
And you want me to get it from the Athenians.

Id: [0x0020110E]
And you want me to bring back your drachmae.

Id: [0x00201112]
There's a lot of people here.

Id: [0x00201113]
We're here to evaluate the strides taken by the Cult since the last meeting. We haven't met for some, some time.

Id: [0x00201114]
Where did they come from?

Id: [0x00201115]
The land <i>and</i> across the seas. We assemble as a community. Here, there is no war - there are no sides.

Id: [0x00201116]
You mentioned someone. Deimos. Who is that?

Id: [0x00201117]
You'll learn his name very, <i>very </i>quickly.

Id: [0x00201118]
He's our leader.

Id: [0x00201119]
I'm sure <i>he </i>believes that, but no, he's our weapon. [beat]He's... difficult, but he does important work for us. I don't envy his position one bit.

Id: [0x0020111B]
I'll go talk to the others. Thank you.

Id: [0x0020111C]
Yes, yes, before Deimos comes. Who knows if you'll get a word in after<i> that</i>.

Id: [0x0020111E]
So you want me to get back your drachmae?

Id: [0x00201120]
You need me to return your drachmae.

Id: [0x00201122]
And I should retrieve your drachmae?

Id: [0x0020113D]
And you want me to retrieve it.

Id: [0x00201143]
So the plan's for me to go get it.

Id: [0x00201145]
You want me to retrieve it, right?

Id: [0x00201147]
And you're asking me to get it for you?

Id: [0x00201149]
You want me to bring it to you.

Id: [0x0020115B]
You want me to get it from the bandits?

Id: [0x00201177]
You want me to deliver it?

Id: [0x0020117E]
So you need me to deliver it?

Id: [0x00201180]
I'm supposed to deliver it?

Id: [0x00201182]
Well, even bandits need something to fill their stomachs...

Id: [0x00201183]
Then they can eat beans and vegetables like the Pythagoreans do. They need to leave my animals alone. Permanently.

Id: [0x00201184]
Killing animals for sport is a waste. The soldiers could at least eat the meat.

Id: [0x00201185]
You still eat meat? Well. As long as you're not killing the animals I'm studying. I want them left alone.

Id: [0x00201186]
So you want me to bring it to him.

Id: [0x00201188]
And you want me to deliver it to him.

Id: [0x00201194]
You want me to bring it to her.

Id: [0x00201196]
And you'll pay me to deliver it to her.

Id: [0x002011B3]
So you want me to bring this to the merchant.

Id: [0x002011B7]
Well, don't keep me waiting. What did it say?

Id: [0x002011B8]
It's a list of statues, and... there's something else, but it's not complete.

Id: [0x002011B9]
Do you think the complete message will be revealed once all the statues have been visited?

Id: [0x002011BE]
Are you asking me to deliver it to the bully?

Id: [0x002011C3]
And you want me to deliver it to the spy.

Id: [0x002011C8]
What kind of sanctuary isn't safe for its priests?

Id: [0x002011C9]
Times have changed, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x002011CA]
I wonder what Hippokrates would think of these...  treatments.

Id: [0x002011CB]
Showed? He's healing the sick right now.

Id: [0x002011CC]
He puts too much faith in his hands, and not enough in the gods.

Id: [0x002011D3]
Hippokrates is a fine healer. Showed so much promise.

Id: [0x002011EE]
So you want me to bring it to the blacksmith.

Id: [0x002011F3]
You want me to deliver it to the captain.

Id: [0x002011F8]
You want me to deliver it to the Athenian commander.

Id: [0x002011FD]
You're worried someone will use them.

Id: [0x002011FE]
I'm worried that rotten thief will sell them! That bag of poisons is how I earn my living.

Id: [0x002011FF]
You want me to deliver it to the Spartan commander.

Id: [0x00201204]
When it comes to life and death, I prefer hands.

Id: [0x00201205]
So you want me to deliver it to the physician.

Id: [0x0020120B]
So you want me to deliver it to the musician.

Id: [0x00201214]
So you want me to deliver it to the fisher.

Id: [0x00201219]
So you want me to deliver it to the farmer.

Id: [0x0020121E]
So you want me to deliver it to the herbalist.

Id: [0x00201225]
So you want me to deliver it to the politician.

Id: [0x00201252]
I can't keep chasing after statues for you.

Id: [0x00201253]
So it's safe to say that at each of these statues, there'll be a clue?

Id: [0x00201254]
Pephka...

Id: [0x00201258]
Did you get the messages? There are mysteries to unlock here, ones that might save my life.

Id: [0x0020125D]
You want me to be the protector.

Id: [0x00201262]
[&ah]I should've never doubted that you were in danger.

Id: [0x00201263]
Phidias!

Id: [0x00201264]
So you want me to protect him?

Id: [0x00201267]
So you want me to protect her?

Id: [0x0020126D]
So you want me to provide protection?

Id: [0x00201272]
Ares, oh mighty god of war... <LF>

Id: [0x00201275]
And you'd like me to protect him.

Id: [0x00201277]
Are you asking me to protect him?

Id: [0x0020127C]
You want me to keep her safe.

Id: [0x0020127E]
I see... You want me to protect her.

Id: [0x00201282]
[&breath]You must work for drachmae just like everyone else. Whatever the commander is paying you, I'll pay you more. Then we leave.

Id: [0x00201287]
And let this person die? [beat]I could be convinced, on two conditions.

Id: [0x0020128B]
Out with it.

Id: [0x0020128C]
I'll take double - a life's worth a lot. And for the sake of the gods, don't tell Hippokrates.

Id: [0x002014AC]
Hippokrates would never put drachmae before a patient's life. But here, since you're so determined to be a mercenary.

Id: [0x002014AF]
I'll meet you there. Don't be late.

Id: [0x002014B3]
Hippokrates puts healing patients before getting paid, and you expect a fortune?

Id: [0x002014B5]
We can't all be Hippokrates. If you don't have the drachmae, then stand back and let me heal my patient.

Id: [0x00201825]
You greedy, self-serving toad! Hippokrates only charges what his patients can afford. What makes you so special?

Id: [0x00201827]
He's a great man, but he's not the only one saving lives, <i>misthios</i>. This is expensive work. Stand back and watch.

Id: [0x0020182F]
Dymas? What are you doing here?

Id: [0x00201831]
Poor.

Id: [0x00201837]
There was a fire. Your notes were destroyed. What matters is that Dymas is here to help.

Id: [0x00201839]
No, I didn't.

Id: [0x0020183A]
Your notes were destroyed, so he demanded pay to come help.

Id: [0x0020183B]
You said you wouldn't tell him!

Id: [0x0020183C]
No matter. Dymas can help, and we have a man who needs saving.

Id: [0x0020183D]
Good. Dymas, with me.

Id: [0x00201861]
This man didn't drown. He was stabbed to death here on shore.

Id: [0x00201865]
Hmm... a bloody trail. Someone was dragged towards the cliffs.

Id: [0x0020186F]
And where exactly is this bay?

Id: [0x00201870]
Tell me more about the girl.

Id: [0x00201871]
I don't know... some Mytilene lovely, full of history and poetry from that school over there. She keeps my boy's head in the clouds instead of focused on his work.

Id: [0x00201872]
Fisherman's Bay is northeast of here, and runs through the middle of our island. You can't miss it.

Id: [0x00201873]
Let's quit chatting so I can go find your son.

Id: [0x00201874]
See that you do. I'll pay you, and then my boy's hide will pay for taking my boat out.

Id: [0x00201894]
Me? No. Brave people are just looking for trouble.

Id: [0x00201895]
But if <i>you</i> wanna be brave? <i>Open it.</i>

Id: [0x00201899]
These ruins are an... interesting place to set up camp. What brings you here?

Id: [0x002018A6]
It's the fisherman's son!

Id: [0x002018AF]
There's the fishing boat. But where's the fisherman's son?

Id: [0x002018B4]
A long time ago, below this very spot, my <i>pater</i> - the great adventurer, Nikios - entered the labyrinth to steal the Minotaur's treasure.

Id: [0x002018EE]
[howls]Two-legs! Over here!

Id: [0x002018F7]
Isn't this <i>amaaaaaazing</i>?!

Id: [0x00201900]
I've seen some things, Ardos. But this...

Id: [0x00201901]
IS AMAAAAAAAAAZING.

Id: [0x00201903]
It's just a ruined door.

Id: [0x00201905]
A big door, sure.

Id: [0x00201907]
S-Stop ruining everything!

Id: [0x0020190F]
Where <i>is</i> it?

Id: [0x00201918]
What –

Id: [0x0020191E]
"True knowledge exists in knowing that you know nothing." A good friend told me that once.

Id: [0x00201921]
Impossible... Kassandra?

Id: [0x0020192A]
Your notes were destroyed in a fire. This misthios brought me here to help.

Id: [0x002019EE]
I would assume so.

Id: [0x002019EF]
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble to ensure this remains a secret.

Id: [0x002019F0]
Maybe it will reveal the identity of the ones who want to dispose of me... Will you help?

Id: [0x00201A1C]
It cost a life, and me a fortune. You wouldn't believe how much I had to pay this healer to come with me.

Id: [0x00201A1D]
[beat]Is this true?

Id: [0x00201A1E]
This healer will devote the rest of his life to serving others and you, Hippokrates. This should never happen again.

Id: [0x00201A43]
Tell me, have you visited all the statues?

Id: [0x00201A46]
You said you wouldn't tell Hippokrates.

Id: [0x00201A49]
Look, if I get time. I'll come back.

Id: [0x00201A4B]
No, I didn't. But I'd say now is a good time to start working for that pay.

Id: [0x00201A99]
There are three locations listed. Each region has a statue of some renown placed there.

Id: [0x00201A9A]
Yes, it'll be quite a journey, the statues are scattered all over. There's one near Kythera, another at Thasos[2400846], and also Samos[1016766].

Id: [0x00201A9C]
Thank the gods you're back. Please, will you help me?

Id: [0x00201ABB]
Why not just stop? Whatever you're studying can't be worth your life.

Id: [0x00201ABC]
Even if I did, I don't think they'd leave me alone. Now my cousin is missing. I think they might have captured him to threaten me.

Id: [0x00201ABF]
It sounds like those Followers need to be taught a lesson.

Id: [0x00201AC0]
If it were just me, I wouldn't worry about it, but they're threatening my family. My cousin is missing. I think they've captured him.

Id: [0x00201AC3]
At least we saved one soul today.

Id: [0x00201ACD]
Who's trying to kill you?

Id: [0x00201ACE]
Everyone. I made a philter that can cure any illness. But everyone wants to steal the recipe for themselves! The bandits, the soldiers, the -

Id: [0x00201ACF]
I get the idea.

Id: [0x00201AD0]
I don't know how much longer I have before they strike.

Id: [0x00201AD2]
The payment we should seek is the preservation of life. A good doctor puts the needs of his patients first.

Id: [0x00201AF1]
It is a fitting place then to look for Aphrodite.

Id: [0x00201AF2]
Exactly! The island lies at the southeastern tip of the Peloponnese. [beat]You will find what we seek at Aphrodite's feet.

Id: [0x00201AF3]
What statue should I be looking for in Kythera?

Id: [0x00201AF4]
Oh, what an island! The birthplace of the goddess of love. How I wish I could go with you...

Id: [0x00201B0E]
Trouble? Just walk in! Who's going to stop you? The priest?[&laughs]

Id: [0x00201B0F]
All right, but if things get out of hand, I'm blaming you, Barnabas.

Id: [0x00201B12]
First, we pour water on its head. If it nods, we may proceed. Gods, mortals, and animals - all must be willing participants in a sacrifice, or it is impure. To save this many people, we will need the beast's blood, bones, and fat.

Id: [0x00201B14]
What's in Thasos[2400846]?

Id: [0x00201B15]
Ah, a controversial statue indeed. It can only be the one of Theagenes from this northern isle.

Id: [0x00201B16]
Theagenes?

Id: [0x00201B17]
The Olympic hero! It's even rumored that Herakles himself was his father. He was exquisitely immortalized by the sculptor Glaukias of Aegina.

Id: [0x00201B1C]
These people have been waiting for days!

Id: [0x00201B1D]
Disgraceful!

Id: [0x00201B38]
That's too bad, but I'm not sure how I can help.

Id: [0x00201B3B]
Sounds like business as usual to me.

Id: [0x00201B43]
If you want me to believe you're innocent, prove it.

Id: [0x00201B44]
I heard he was attacked with a knife. I only ever had one knife, and it was stolen moons ago.

Id: [0x00201B45]
Is that so?

Id: [0x00201B46]
They're proposing we use irrational numbers. Even the name proves it's nonsense! Please stop them before they bring the wrath of the gods upon us.

Id: [0x00201B4C]
She would have come here a long time ago, with an injured baby. Are you sure she would have passed through the Sanctuary of Asklepios?

Id: [0x00201B4D]
I was a young man then. When I encountered a situation beyond my skills, I would send the patient to the Sanctuary.

Id: [0x00201B4E]
And these priests kept records of their patients?

Id: [0x00201B4F]
Yes, engraved in stone. The elder priest might remember.

Id: [0x00201B54]
According to Sostratos, you don't like people mentioning your... you know.

Id: [0x00201B55]
My what?

Id: [0x00201B57]
Your hair. [&breath]Or lack of it.

Id: [0x00201B59]
Yes, yes. Make your jokes while walking around like one of Phidias's sculptures come to life.

Id: [0x00201B5D]
When I told old Dymas here you were in need, I could barely hold him back.

Id: [0x00201B5E]
That's just the effect the great doctor has on us healers. There was a fire. Your notes were lost. But I'm here to help.

Id: [0x00201B5F]
I can always use another set of hands.

Id: [0x00201B63]
What statue should I seek in Samos[1016766]?

Id: [0x00201B64]
Why Poseidon, of course! It is as if you are watching the god himself holding back the waves.

Id: [0x00201B65]
As am I. Stay safe, Phidias.

Id: [0x00201B66]
You too, and return to me as soon as you have all the clues.

Id: [0x00201B67]
Don't worry, I will.

Id: [0x00201B68]
I should be on my way. This will take some time.

Id: [0x00201B69]
Of course, but I am excited to see where this will lead.

Id: [0x00201B75]
I need a bit more information.

Id: [0x00201B76]
Of course, anything for you.

Id: [0x00201B97]
I'm here to see the Pythia.

Id: [0x00201B98]
How does one get chosen?

Id: [0x00201B99]
One goes to the back of the line.

Id: [0x00201BA2]
I shouldn't delay any further.

Id: [0x00201BA3]
I almost envy you your travels. Kythera, Samos, and Thasos...

Id: [0x00201C41]
I have fought in too many wars. I have seen too many people die. I have walked from one end of the Earth to the other... This belongs to you now.

Id: [0x00201C42]
Kassandra –

Id: [0x00201C45]
Promise me one thing.

Id: [0x00201C46]
Anything.

Id: [0x00201C47]
When you are done. Destroy it. Destroy them all.

Id: [0x00201C49]
[[Ancient Greek: Earth, mother of all, I greet you.]]

Id: [0x00201C52]
I don't see Kleon - that rodent. I should go find Brasidas.

Id: [0x00201C71]
I know I have a reputation, but my skill is more with weapons than weather.

Id: [0x00201C73]
That's why I'm glad you're here. My measurements prove it's the Followers of Ares at the sanctuary. Their mathematical rites are angering the gods! I need someone strong to stop them.

Id: [0x00201C9D]
I'm not sure how you expect a mercenary to help with the weather.

Id: [0x00201C9E]
Not with the weather, but with the Followers of Ares. Any scientist can see their mathematical rites are angering the gods. I need someone to stop them.

Id: [0x00201CC0]
Can't you see I'm busy?

Id: [0x00201D25]
What would they want with your notes?

Id: [0x00201D26]
They said my work is impious. But I only study the stars. I just want to do my calculations in peace!

Id: [0x00201D30]
You got my message.

Id: [0x00201D31]
I heard about Pylos. Are you all right?

Id: [0x00201D32]
I've been through worse. We have bigger problems right now.

Id: [0x00201D38]
Brasidas, you're here.

Id: [0x00201D5A]
Tell me what I need to do.

Id: [0x00201D70]
The Spartans do take slaves. But so do the Athenians. Why are you so worried now?

Id: [0x00201D71]
He was looking right at me when he said it!

Id: [0x00201D83]
All the more reason to act.

Id: [0x00201DB4]
Come on champion, is that all you've got?

Id: [0x00201DB6]
You'll need to move faster in the Battle, champion.

Id: [0x00201DB7]
I'm pacing myself.

Id: [0x00201DBA]
After Pylos - what happened?

Id: [0x00201DBB]
The remaining Spartans found me and gave me time to recover, so I did.

Id: [0x00201DBC]
But your leg -

Id: [0x00201DC6]
I thought you'd be faster.

Id: [0x00201DC7]
Just enjoying the view.

Id: [0x00201DCA]
Now you're just showing off.

Id: [0x00201DCD]
Indeed, Roxana tells me your training went well. Meet me inside the city gates. The Battle will begin soon.

Id: [0x00201DEF]
Enough!

Id: [0x00201E07]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00201E1E]
Good thing I killed the right priestess.

Id: [0x00201E20]
Indeed.

Id: [0x00201E2B]
This is bigger than Deimos, misthios. This is about -

Id: [0x00201E4E]
No, it's not! It's a really - a -

Id: [0x00201E5A]
So the Minotaur lies beneath Knossos Palace...

Id: [0x00201E5B]
Open the door. I've got a minotaur to slay.

Id: [0x00201E63]
It's locked.

Id: [0x00201E6D]
That's nice of him.

Id: [0x00201E6F]
The Collector, Swordfish, and my old caretaker.

Id: [0x00201E70]
My old caretaker -

Id: [0x00201E71]
Bold.

Id: [0x00201E7A]
<i>Misthios</i>! Can I interest you in some lumber for your ship?

Id: [0x00201E7E]
Tell me more about this old man.

Id: [0x00201E7F]
Where did you say I'll find your caretaker?

Id: [0x00201E80]
OLD caretaker.

Id: [0x00201E82]
The message said to meet him at our old house[2401651] to the northeast, near Phaistos.

Id: [0x00201E85]
This won't be an easy task, but whatever the messages reveal must be important...

Id: [0x00201E89]
The sculptor has truly captured the beauty of Aphrodite.

Id: [0x00201E8B]
So this is meant to be the mighty champion Theagenes. Preserved for all time... sitting on his ass.

Id: [0x00201E8D]
Incredible, Phidias was right. The artist has captured Poseidon in all his magnificence.

Id: [0x00201E8F]
That's the last one. Time to head back to Olympia and Phidias to find out what all this means.

Id: [0x00201E92]
This is our chance, Brasidas. We kill Kleon today.

Id: [0x00201E93]
You disappeared from battle.

Id: [0x00201E97]
Got it!

Id: [0x00201E9C]
It's got to be here somewhere...

Id: [0x00201EA5]
Look, it's not a secret the Spartans don't like the sciences. And I study the sky. That makes me slave material.

Id: [0x00201EBA]
It's at Fort Samikon. It can also be located in the Village of Stymphalos. Go to Ruined Temple of Apollo.

Id: [0x00201EBF]
So Kleon's in Amphipolis...

Id: [0x00201EC0]
Somewhere. And in armor, I hear. He'll fight for his life today.

Id: [0x00201EC1]
He wants to be the hero. Athenians can't think much of him after what he did.

Id: [0x00201EC5]
Nor should they! After all, if someone lies to you a single time, what's to say they would not do so again?

Id: [0x00201ED5]
This is your final warning.

Id: [0x00201EDB]
You will tell me what I want to know or suffer the consequences.

Id: [0x00201EE1]
This has gone on long enough.

Id: [0x00201EE7]
I will not stand by while your work insults the gods.

Id: [0x00201F05]
Telling a mercenary you don't like war is a... strange way to start a conversation.

Id: [0x00201F06]
You don't understand! [beat]Think of the learning we lose. If I were killed tomorrow, my notes on the movement of the spheres would be lost! Gone forever!

Id: [0x00201F08]
You're right. Too many innocent lives are lost to war.

Id: [0x00201F09]
Not just lives. Think of the knowledge! I've measured the world around us. The spheres. If I die, it's all lost.

Id: [0x00201F0B]
I have.

Id: [0x00201F0C]
Well. He was supporting me - giving me money to fund me discovering new drugs. But now he's dead, and I haven't been paid!

Id: [0x00201F9F]
So you study the stars. I don't see what that has to do with me.

Id: [0x00201FA0]
I made a copy of all my notes. I want you to take it to a friend of mine - where it will be safe. Then if I die, my work is preserved!

Id: [0x00201FA3]
You've proven yourself. It's a risk, but I trust you.

Id: [0x00201FA9]
No giving up!

Id: [0x00201FAB]
And you need my help to keep it? I'm no scientist.

Id: [0x00201FAC]
Don't worry about that. I've copied it all down. I just need it delivered to a friend, somewhere safe. That way if I die, it's preserved.

Id: [0x00201FE7]
If you don't, then I will.

Id: [0x00201FE8]
There's something you're not telling me.

Id: [0x00201FEA]
I am here for Kleon. Let's keep it at that.

Id: [0x00201FEB]
Is this because of Lagos?

Id: [0x00201FEC]
You're not who I thought you were. You were raised Spartan - you should know how to be loyal.

Id: [0x00201FF7]
It's Hippokrates. It's really him!

Id: [0x00201FFE]
The father of medicine. That bald spot - like a beacon of hope for all who seek him!

Id: [0x00202005]
Is that the <i>real</i> Hippokrates? I heard he can raise the dead!

Id: [0x0020200C]
Hippokrates is here. Bless the gods. He'll be able to stop this pain.

Id: [0x0020200E]
I came here, didn't I? We're fighting the same fight.

Id: [0x00202010]
I did what I thought was right.

Id: [0x0020201F]
We're wasting time. Athens is gathering reinforcements.

Id: [0x00202021]
We need to attack now. Let's go.

Id: [0x0020202A]
I really need those notes.

Id: [0x0020202F]
The humors are accumulating at an alarming rate... If only I had my notes.

Id: [0x00202034]
Curses, I should have made a second copy of my notes.

Id: [0x00202055]
Die, Spartans!

Id: [0x0020235C]
Leaders have their reasons. Maybe his dealings help more than you know.

Id: [0x00202361]
You amateurs are wasting my time.

Id: [0x00202364]
The champion returns. Do you have more questions, or are you ready to fight?

Id: [0x00202371]
Where can I find the leader of Lesbos?

Id: [0x00202372]
He lives in Mytilene. When he's not at home, he's inspecting the troops in the fort or praying to his chosen god. You know, anything to avoid real work.

Id: [0x00202374]
Can I hire you to help?

Id: [0x0020237A]
Lesbos is a bountiful place. Why does the leader use all of Chios's resources?

Id: [0x0020237B]
Damned if I know. We keep chopping down all our trees and killing all our animals for Mytilene. Soon we won't have anything left.

Id: [0x0020237D]
I'll remove the problem in Mytilene for you.

Id: [0x0020237E]
When you've finished, I'll send the reward to your ship.

Id: [0x00202387]
I should look for the leader in his home, the fort, and the temple.

Id: [0x00202389]
It's at the Ruined Temple of Zeus. This is a test (with parentheses).

Id: [0x00202397]
Her caged "family" is in the deforested area.

Id: [0x0020239D]
[howls]Two-legs! Thank you again for freeing my family.

Id: [0x002023A2]
Our lives are like the rising and setting of the sun.

Id: [0x002023BE]
Ah! I remember this tale. Written during the time of the great Helot Revolt. You would have been only a child.

Id: [0x002023BF]
I don't need the history, just the details.

Id: [0x002023C0]
It tells the tale of a woman with worms in her throat. Asklepios took off her head so we could remove them, then reattached it in her sleep.

Id: [0x002023C1]
Definitely not the right one.

Id: [0x002023C8]
Are all the testimonies so... outrageous?

Id: [0x002023C9]
Writers today - Thucydides, Euripides, the petulant Aristophanes... All of them try for realism, but - what really inspires is greatness, magic, gods!

Id: [0x002023CF]
This one tells the tale of a man with sword wounds. A pack of dogs licked him clean, and eureka! A man's best friend indeed.

Id: [0x002023D6]
I wonder what Hippokrates would think of these...  treatments.

Id: [0x002023D7]
Hippokrates is a fine healer. Showed so much promise.

Id: [0x002023D8]
Showed? He's healing the sick right now.

Id: [0x002023D9]
He puts too much faith in his hands, and not enough in the gods.

Id: [0x002023DA]
When it comes to life and death, I prefer hands.

Id: [0x002023E1]
This is hopeless.

Id: [0x002023E2]
These stories <i>give</i> people hope, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x002023E3]
Well, I'm losing mine.

Id: [0x002023F0]
Please, leave us!

Id: [0x002023F1]
The hetaerae! Where are they?!

Id: [0x002023F2]
The hetaerae aren't here!

Id: [0x002023F3]
Then <i>you're </i>gonna pay for the trouble we went through to find 'em.

Id: [0x002023F4]
We're here in <i>peace</i>!

Id: [0x002023F5]
Aphrodite aid us!

Id: [0x002023FA]
Behind you, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x002023FB]
Here come some more!

Id: [0x002025C5]
You haven't proven that.

Id: [0x002025C6]
Let me prove it now.

Id: [0x002025C7]
You hurt my reputation.

Id: [0x002025C8]
I can fix that, Brasidas. Let me fix it.

Id: [0x002025CD]
If I never eat another apple -

Id: [0x002025D0]
Roxana is training outside her house! She's fighting everyone!

Id: [0x002025D2]
Let's go.

Id: [0x002025F4]
Puny Spartan! I'll bring Xerxes your head.

Id: [0x002025F9]
I was captured - taken to Athens for an interrogation with Deimos and Kleon.

Id: [0x002025FA]
They didn't kill you.

Id: [0x002025FB]
They tried.

Id: [0x002025FC]
What's so great about these champions? They're just four people against the Spartan military.

Id: [0x002025FD]
Sparta has its army, and Boeotia has its legends. They're a symbol of what this place used to be.

Id: [0x00202608]
Follow me!

Id: [0x00202609]
Who do you think took her?

Id: [0x0020260A]
It wouldn't be the first time the Monger's men came after one of us.

Id: [0x0020260F]
There! That's the boat our client described. Please, get her back safely.

Id: [0x00202616]
[&scream]Kleio?[/&scream] Kleio? Has anyone seen Kleio?

Id: [0x0020261C]
So you're asking me to send all the Athenians to the underworld.

Id: [0x00202678]
The gods must hate me if our paths keep crossing.

Id: [0x00202679]
Modest, but mortal... And Hades will have you, too.

Id: [0x002026CD]
It's too late.

Id: [0x002026CE]
Let me explain -

Id: [0x002026D0]
I know you killed Nikolaos.

Id: [0x002026D2]
That man destroyed my life, and they made him a general for it! I had no choice.

Id: [0x002027AF]
[&scream]You![/&scream] [&scream]Please![/&scream] [&scream]Help![/&scream]

Id: [0x002027B4]
You're untied. Go!

Id: [0x002027BA]
Warriors! Heroes! Mercenaries of all types. Sign up here for the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x002027BC]
Would you like to be rich? Are you the next Champion?

Id: [0x002027BE]
You, <i>misthios</i>. You look like a true contender.

Id: [0x002027C2]
What's this battle you're calling out about?

Id: [0x002027C5]
If you join the Battle, you'll have the chance to prove your mettle against the best. And because the Battle is backed by the most powerful and influential people in the Greek world, the purse is always growing.

Id: [0x002027C8]
I met Roxana on Hydrea. She says you're the one to talk to about entering the battle on Melos.

Id: [0x002027C9]
Indeed I am. My name's Drakios.

Id: [0x002027CA]
Kassandra. I'm interested in competing in this... What did you call it?

Id: [0x002027CE]
Killing is how I make my drachmae. This battle will be no different.

Id: [0x002027D0]
It's true. You have the look of a mythical hero about you...

Id: [0x002027D1]
I expect future generations to sing songs in my honor.

Id: [0x002027D2]
I do my best work in the shadows. Not sure how I'd fare on an open battlefield...

Id: [0x002027D4]
It's true that only the best-trained have a hope of glory in the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x002027D5]
I make no promises.

Id: [0x002027D7]
If you mean the people I think you mean, then I would like to meet them and... [beat]have a few <i>words</i>.

Id: [0x002027D8]
Indeed. They are the kind of people I would never speak about openly.

Id: [0x002027E0]
I want to fight in the Battle.

Id: [0x002027E1]
I thought you might. The only rule is that every competitor must train with another competitor, and they must vouch for each other.

Id: [0x002027E2]
I've already met Roxana on Hydrea.

Id: [0x002027E3]
So I've heard. She was going to be my top recommendation as she's amongst our highest-ranked contenders. If you can train with her, then there is certainly a place for you in the Battle.

Id: [0x002027E4]
And you can direct me to a worthy training partner.

Id: [0x002027E5]
Indeed, indeed. One of our top-ranked competitors is looking for a training companion. [beat]Roxana. She spars on Hydrea, the island just north of here.

Id: [0x002027E7]
What do you know about Roxana?

Id: [0x002027E8]
She's from a long line of aspiring champions. Indeed, virtually her entire family has tried to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x002027E9]
<i>Aspiring</i> champions.

Id: [0x002027EA]
None of them were as skilled as Roxana, it must be said.

Id: [0x002027EB]
What started the tradition of a free-for-all battle on Melos?

Id: [0x002027EC]
I started it with some financial support from the powerful people I mentioned. The metaphor is that each combatant is battling a <i>Hecatoncheir</i>.

Id: [0x002027ED]
The creature with fifty heads and one hundred hands.

Id: [0x002027EE]
Indeed. By defeating all the competitors, it's as if the champion has slain the creature itself - quite an achievement. Not something to be attempted by the weak.

Id: [0x002027EF]
Indeed.

Id: [0x002027F0]
I'm going to do something else.

Id: [0x002027F1]
Indeed.

Id: [0x002027F2]
These powerful people you mentioned. They're the Cult of Kosmos, aren't they?

Id: [0x002027F3]
The mysterious ones. You want to meet them. [beat]I know, but it will have to wait.

Id: [0x002027F4]
How long?

Id: [0x002027F5]
I stay close with all of my champions. If you win the Battle, it's something we can discuss over victory wine.

Id: [0x002027F6]
I'm ready to compete.

Id: [0x002027F8]
You haven't yet finished your training.

Id: [0x002027FA]
You <i>do</i> seem capable enough. If you gave me a heavy bag of drachmae, however, I might be able to waive that requirement.

Id: [0x002027FF]
I already finished my training with Roxana.

Id: [0x00202800]
Ha! Indeed, show me a <i>misthios,</i> and I'll show you a liar. Nice try.

Id: [0x00202801]
I'll finish training and return.

Id: [0x00202804]
I'd rather not bother with the training.

Id: [0x00202808]
Was the promise of glory too much to walk away from?

Id: [0x00202809]
We should talk.

Id: [0x0020280A]
I'm at your disposal.

Id: [0x0020280B]
My name's Drakios. It's a pleasure to meet you...

Id: [0x0020280D]
Kassandra. [beat]Tell me about the Battle.

Id: [0x00202824]
Thank you for saving my dear friend, Galarnos. He's sleeping now, but he described your heroic deeds to me.

Id: [0x00202825]
It was nothing to write an epic poem about.

Id: [0x00202826]
However it came to pass, you have my thanks, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00202830]
Ah. Uh, right.

Id: [0x00202834]
The boots must be here.

Id: [0x00202836]
Boooooooring old man -

Id: [0x00202837]
Never wanted to talk to me about my pater or the Minotaur, so I left him to find out the truth on my own.

Id: [0x0020283C]
The headgear is near the center hut.

Id: [0x00202841]
The armor should be here.

Id: [0x0020284D]
Bandits typically move from place to place. They don't own farms and take slaves.

Id: [0x0020284E]
You're right. The farm wasn't always ours. We paid the bandits for it, and when we couldn't keep up the payments...

Id: [0x0020284F]
Bandits are murderers and thieves. What did you think would happen?

Id: [0x00202850]
Still... a farm for the lives of my family? I'll do anything to get them back.

Id: [0x00202852]
I'm sure you had no choice... But you're right to worry about your sons.

Id: [0x00202853]
The bandit's leader... He said my family would serve as a warning to others.

Id: [0x00202855]
You're sure there's nothing else you should tell me?

Id: [0x00202857]
Yes. I'm sorry I tried to hide the truth. I'll find a way to repay you if you can bring me back my sons.

Id: [0x00202858]
Bandits don't care about what's fair.

Id: [0x0020285C]
This must be the farm.

Id: [0x00202861]
One of the sons must be here somewhere.

Id: [0x00202866]
Run! I'll save your brother!

Id: [0x00202868]
You're free. Go back to your mother.

Id: [0x00202870]
Thank you for saving my boys!

Id: [0x00202874]
That's ridiculous.

Id: [0x00202875]
It's all I know, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00202876]
If you can take him out, we're all better for it.

Id: [0x00202878]
Hmm... On second thought. Would you fetch my lazy son? He's at Fisherman's Bay. An easy errand for fair pay.

Id: [0x0020287B]
I see your sons made it back to you, and those bandits won't bother you again. The farm is yours if you still want it.

Id: [0x0020287C]
Praise Athena! My sons are both safe and sound. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00202883]
My drachmae! Tell me where your father hid my drachmae!

Id: [0x002028D7]
Don't come back until you have the tablet.

Id: [0x002028D8]
Yes, Polemarch.

Id: [0x002028DA]
Lost something?

Id: [0x002028DB]
Not lost, stolen.

Id: [0x002028DD]
Stentor sent me, said you've been having trouble with spies.

Id: [0x002028DE]
I'd take an Athenian spy over a Spartan traitor. Either way he must be found. He took a tablet with vital intelligence.

Id: [0x002028DF]
Where's your spy? Is he still in the camp?

Id: [0x002028E0]
Wouldn't need you if I knew.

Id: [0x002028E1]
I doubt he's still here. Can't have gone far though, he was injured when he took out the guard.

Id: [0x002028E8]
This doesn't sound like something a Spartan would do?

Id: [0x002028E9]
He <i>could</i> be an imposter, we've had raids on our supplies recently... And Megaris has more mercenaries than a goat has ticks.

Id: [0x002028EB]
And what man would turn their back on Sparta?

Id: [0x002028EC]
I'll get him <i>and</i> your tablet.

Id: [0x002028EE]
Whoever he is, I will make him pay for betraying Sparta.

Id: [0x002028EF]
Misthios! If this man is a Spartan... take your time killing him.

Id: [0x002028F0]
I'll get the tablet for you, and deal with the one responsible.

Id: [0x002028F3]
This spy needs to be found. The information he stole is crucial to the war effort.

Id: [0x002028F8]
Did you see which direction he went?

Id: [0x002028F9]
The men said he went towards the hill, easier to avoid pursuit in that terrain.

Id: [0x002028FA]
Anything you can tell me that might help?

Id: [0x002028FB]
The area is hotly contested, but Sparta is winning. We're pushing the Athenians back, but due to the war the forests and mountains have become a hive for bandits and mercenaries.

Id: [0x002028FC]
I mean about where your <i>spy</i> might have gone.

Id: [0x002028FD]
He's injured, and there's a spring up there in the forest. If it was me I would have headed there.

Id: [0x002028FE]
I'll be back soon with your tablet.

Id: [0x002028FF]
The mountains and forest of Megaris are dangerous, and he surely didn't work alone.

Id: [0x00202900]
I'm more than capable of handling your spy. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00202908]
Did you find the coward who did this?

Id: [0x00202909]
I found him, and he paid in blood for his deeds.

Id: [0x0020290A]
As long as he paid. Did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x00202910]
So, did you find the traitor?

Id: [0x00202911]
It's not traitors you need to worry about. He was a spy working for the mercenary Hyrkanos.

Id: [0x00202912]
Hyrkanos. How many times must I hear that name? His palms must be overflowing with Athenian gold by now. Did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x0020291B]
You don't need to worry about him anymore. It was a tough fight, but I took him down. He paid in blood!

Id: [0x0020291C]
Yes... But did you get the tablet?

Id: [0x0020291D]
Oh, er, yes. Of course.

Id: [0x00202920]
Good.

Id: [0x00202922]
Here's your precious tablet. You should be more careful in future.

Id: [0x00202925]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00202929]
Did you locate the one responsible?

Id: [0x0020292E]
Wha... What do you want? Who are you?

Id: [0x0020292F]
I'm the one who's going to return the tablet you stole.

Id: [0x00202934]
Give it to me, I'm not leaving without it.

Id: [0x00202935]
There's no winners in this war, but there are opportunities. Perhaps we could come to an arrangement?

Id: [0x00202937]
Why did you steal the tablet?

Id: [0x00202938]
Because I was paid to.

Id: [0x00202939]
Who paid you?

Id: [0x0020293A]
A mercenary. Hyrkanos, all right? Gave me the Spartan uniform, told me where to look. Easy drachmae.

Id: [0x0020293C]
How did you get into the camp?

Id: [0x0020293D]
[Chortle turns to cough] Spartans never suspect their own... Too busy looking down on the rest of us. <i>Malákes</i>!

Id: [0x00202944]
What arrangement would that be?

Id: [0x00202945]
Yeah… About that … I’m afraid I do not have the tablet anymore…

Id: [0x0020294E]
Give me the tablet, or I will cut you down.

Id: [0x00202952]
I'll take the tablet now.

Id: [0x00202953]
Like fuck you will.

Id: [0x00202954]
Then only one of us will be getting paid today.

Id: [0x0020295E]
Now! The Cyclops and I have a score of drachmae to settle. The same score as <i>you</i>, my rough-and-tumble friend.

Id: [0x0020295F]
He wouldn't be after me if it wasn't for <i>you</i>, "my friend."

Id: [0x00202960]
[laughs] Heh, heh. Right.

Id: [0x00202961]
But - I swear - this will put an end to it! If he insists on sending his goons after us, we'll make sure his last good day was <i>yesterday</i>.

Id: [0x00202967]
Let's hear it then. What do I have to do?

Id: [0x00202968]
What will <i>we </i>do, you mean! As the brains to your brawn, I consider it a joint effort.

Id: [0x00202969]
Of course you do.

Id: [0x0020296B]
It's not a war, it's a pissing match.

Id: [0x0020296C]
You know <i>just </i>how to hurt me, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0020296D]
It's not that hard, trust me.

Id: [0x0020296F]
Think! What does the Cyclops value most? His men, his land, his ships? No. <i>His obsidian eye.</i>

Id: [0x00202970]
Get to the point, Markos.

Id: [0x00202972]
Oh, fine. [beat] We're going to <i>steal </i>it.

Id: [0x00202973]
Are you crazy? You borrow his drachmae,<i> then </i>you steal his eye?

Id: [0x00202974]
Having it means we win. <i>Then,</i> it goes to market. We kill two birds with one obsidian eye!

Id: [0x00202976]
He'd better hold still, or he'll lose <i>both </i>eyes.

Id: [0x00202977]
No, <i>no</i>! It has to be done without the Cyclops <i>knowing. </i>You <i>cannot </i>be seen!

Id: [0x00202978]
Then my new bow will come in handy.

Id: [0x00202979]
He keeps the eye in his house - it's too valuable to wear out. A wise choice, until you<i> </i>show him the error of his ways. Wait for the sun to set, sneak in, and then! <i>Bring me the eye</i>.

Id: [0x0020297F]
I don't know where the Cyclops lives.

Id: [0x00202980]
Keep to the west side of the island... There, you will find his lair.

Id: [0x00202981]
Fine. But you won't get away with being cheap.

Id: [0x00202982]
<i>Cheap</i>? You wound me, Frederic!

Id: [0x00202983]
It's your defining trait.

Id: [0x00202984]
Bring me the eye, and I'll prove you wrong. Remember! Not a <i>soul </i>can see you!

Id: [0x00202985]
Got it.

Id: [0x00202986]
Pull this off, and our heads won't be the Cyclops's trophies when he comes back!

Id: [0x00202988]
Better be worth something.

Id: [0x00202989]
Do you know how much obsidian goes for on Kephallonia?

Id: [0x0020298A]
I've never seen it.

Id: [0x0020298B]
<i>Exactly. </i>And not only is it obsidian, it's veined with gold. <i>Gold</i>! It's no wonder he saves it for special<i> </i>occasions.

Id: [0x0020298C]
So we'll use the profits to pay him off?

Id: [0x0020298D]
It'll pay for the bulk of it - a vineyard's expensive, you know!

Id: [0x00202990]
This will be <i>simple </i>for you. Sneak into the Cyclops's house, and steal me his eye! [Petty laugh]

Id: [0x00202996]
<i>Ai! </i>Be careful!

Id: [0x00202997]
Do you know how many of his guards were there?

Id: [0x0020299B]
Believe me, I heard the commotion - <i>everybody </i>heard the commotion. <i>What</i> did I say about being seen?

Id: [0x0020299D]
All for a fucking <i>rock</i>...

Id: [0x0020299E]
This "rock<i>" </i>could buy a <i>house, </i>my friend!

Id: [0x0020299F]
And yet it's<i> still</i> not enough to pay back the Cyclops.

Id: [0x002029A1]
Oh, don't be upset! Think of all the <i>fun </i>we've had!

Id: [0x002029A7]
Right. Your fun, my blood. You can't keep dragging me into things, Markos.

Id: [0x002029A9]
The Cyclops is going to kill us, Markos. It's as simple as that. And there's nothing fun about it.

Id: [0x002029AB]
This will work, I promise you! Would I lie to you?

Id: [0x002029AC]
Don't make me answer that.

Id: [0x002029AE]
Take the eye - but don't sell it yet!<i> No</i> vendor would believe we came by it lawfully. They know <i>exactly </i>who it belongs to!

Id: [0x002029AF]
Fine.

Id: [0x002029B0]
Better your pocket than his socket!

Id: [0x002029B2]
I think that's enough for one day. <i>Chaire</i>, Markos.

Id: [0x002029EF]
I understand. He must follow his own path. Good hunting, Kassandra.

Id: [0x002029F0]
I wish you'd helped me back in Sparta. But Stentor does need help now, even if he doesn't want to admit it.

Id: [0x002029F2]
Stentor is as much your family as I am. You can still be there for him.

Id: [0x00202FC7]
I will.

Id: [0x00202FC8]
He may hate me, but I'm glad to have met him... in a way.

Id: [0x00202FC9]
Goodbye, Kassandra of Sparta.

Id: [0x00203C52]
A fine offering to the gods, wouldn't you say?

Id: [0x00203C54]
Not done?!

Id: [0x00203C56]
Soon, we will return for the final contest - the mighty Kassandra against our reigning champion, Dorieus!

Id: [0x00203C5E]
The crowd loves you... but you're not done yet.

Id: [0x00203C6F]
Phidias!

Id: [0x00203C71]
[sigh]I should've never doubted that you were in danger.

Id: [0x00203C88]
What?!

Id: [0x00203C89]
I… I’ve already given the tablet to my partner for him to hide in a nearby spot where I could come back to pick it up when things would have cooled off a little.

Id: [0x00203C8A]
We had to move swiftly to save ourselves from the wrath of Sparta, you see...

Id: [0x00203C8B]
Ugh … Alright, where did told you he’d hide it?

Id: [0x00203C8C]
He just told me to look for a lagoon west of here and to pay my respect to the dead. Then I’d know where to look.

Id: [0x00203C8D]
What’s that, a riddle? If you’re trying to fool me, I swear it won’t end well for you, spy.

Id: [0x00203C8E]
I…I swear that’s the truth! Here, take the indications he gave me.

Id: [0x00203C8F]
You’ll find nothing more in there than what I’ve just told you.

Id: [0x00203C90]
This is better be the truth or I will come back for you and make you eat your sandals with nothing but a pinch of salt.

Id: [0x00203C91]
I can’t fight you, I’ll talk.

Id: [0x00203C92]
Alright, listen carefully. I’ve already given the tablet to my partner for him to hide in a nearby spot where I could come back to pick it up when things would have cooled off a little.

Id: [0x00203C94]
I don’t know precisely where he hid it, though.

Id: [0x00203C95]
He just told me to look for a lagoon west of here and to pay my respect to the deads. Then I’d know where to look.

Id: [0x00203C97]
What is this?! Is your partner the Sphinx?

Id: [0x00203C98]
No, his name is Antiochus. Why?

Id: [0x00203C99]
Nevermind. I’m going to this lagoon and I better find what I’m searching for, or else I’ll be coming back for you.

Id: [0x00203C9A]
Hum... No tablet there, but some indications.

Id: [0x00203C9B]
You seem disappointed.

Id: [0x00203C9C]
The gods are punishing me.

Id: [0x00203C9D]
From what I've seen, you needed a divine intervention.

Id: [0x00203C9E]
We'll cross that river when we get to it.

Id: [0x00203CA5]
Dorieus doesn't like to wait. Are you ready to fight, or aren't you?

Id: [0x00203CA6]
We'll go to the safe house.

Id: [0x00203CA7]
I hope we see <i>pater</i> soon.

Id: [0x00203CBF]
That sounds sad.

Id: [0x00203D07]
The son must be in there...

Id: [0x00203D0C]
So much drachmae... Was he a traveler? A thief?

Id: [0x00203D12]
This definitely isn't a traveler. He must live nearby.

Id: [0x00203D14]
It's not philosophy... it's truth. Learned through violence, fate, and seeing evil... true evil.

Id: [0x00203F88]
I'll find him.

Id: [0x00203F89]
Bring me back my idiot, please.

Id: [0x00203F91]
Ah, you must be the idiot.

Id: [0x00203F94]
Only my wife calls me that!

Id: [0x00203F95]
I wouldn't be so sure.

Id: [0x00203F99]
She did send me to find you, though. Let's get you home.

Id: [0x00203FA8]
If you fancy yourself a <i>hunter</i>, though... there's a monstrous beast in the south. Was gonna go after it myself once I broke in my bow.

Id: [0x00203FA9]
Monstrous beast, huh? I'll have to see it for myself.

Id: [0x00204002]
I hope you're here to buy fish and not just hang about.

Id: [0x00204006]
This is all my fault. I pushed him too hard!

Id: [0x00204016]
Couldn't have made it without you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020401C]
Get out! I never want to see you again<i>.</i>

Id: [0x0020401D]
Oh, I've missed you. Mmm...

Id: [0x00204023]
From now on, I'm keeping Galarnos close to home and using another dealer for my art.

Id: [0x0020402D]
Not much of a love nest<i>.</i>

Id: [0x00204036]
I found scraps of her clothes leading to the Writhing Dread's lair. Please, we need to hurry.

Id: [0x0020403A]
Time to find Ligeia. You lead the way.

Id: [0x0020403C]
I have other business to attend to first.

Id: [0x0020403D]
You better come back - I've entrusted her life to you.

Id: [0x0020403E]
Even a Daughter of Artemis like Ligeia can't survive the Writhing Dread! We need you.

Id: [0x00204053]
Huh. You smell better than last time.

Id: [0x00204056]
We've seen our esteemed newcomer rise quickly to become a contender...

Id: [0x0020405C]
You made your choice.

Id: [0x0020405E]
I thought we were friends.

Id: [0x0020405F]
You... how?

Id: [0x00204060]
You showed up in Megaris, and the Wolf died. No explanation needed.

Id: [0x00204130]
Lagos is alive thanks to you. [beat]I trust you.

Id: [0x00204155]
Stop! I beg you!

Id: [0x0020415B]
Turn back! Don't come any closer.

Id: [0x0020416A]
Astounding! To think I could be a companion to an Olympic champion.

Id: [0x0020416B]
[&gasp]You're even better at sparring than I am -

Id: [0x0020416E]
I was... with my friends Demophanes and Kallias. Respected Olympic judges, no less...

Id: [0x00204175]
Do I look like someone who waits in line?

Id: [0x00204176]
All share our common mind.

Id: [0x00204177]
Good.

Id: [0x00204182]
I hoped if I played near water, he might hear the music as he travels down the Styx.

Id: [0x0020418A]
What happened to him?

Id: [0x0020418B]
He was deceived and murdered by Astra and Deianeira.

Id: [0x002041BB]
I've lost family too. It's your duty to avenge him.

Id: [0x002041BD]
Why would anyone want to kill your brother?

Id: [0x002041BE]
Abreas spoke out against the alliance with the Athenians and accused the champions of betraying Boeotia.

Id: [0x002041BF]
Seems like he doubted Deianeira's loyalty.

Id: [0x002041C0]
Should I have heard those names?

Id: [0x002041C1]
Deianeira is a champion of Boeotia, and Astra is her cousin. They do everything together - even kill.

Id: [0x002041C2]
I wouldn't expect someone of such renown to need help.

Id: [0x002041C3]
Abreas and I used to spar with them as children. They work as one, covering each other's weaknesses.

Id: [0x002041CB]
Now that your quest for vengeance is complete, why not start a new life? I could always use a man like you on the Adrestia.

Id: [0x002041CE]
Yes. A fresh start would be good. The gods made us cross paths, after all.

Id: [0x002041CF]
Glad to have you with us.

Id: [0x002041D1]
I can't. My place is here in Boeotia. I will take up my brother's work, and become a true protector of the land.

Id: [0x002041D2]
Boeotia will be all the better for it. May Tyche watch over you.

Id: [0x002041D7]
You expect me to trust you? After how you slaughtered the Monger? I know what you do to Cultists. I won't bow my head just for you to cut it off.

Id: [0x002041E6]
That wasn't my plan.

Id: [0x002041E7]
Then I should thank you for letting me face death as Spartans do.

Id: [0x002041EA]
You consider me your ally today... How can I know you and Brasidas won't change your minds?

Id: [0x002041EB]
We can work together against our common enemy. You deserve better than to live under the threat of the Cult.

Id: [0x002041F4]
"Join Brasidas and me in our fight against the Cult." Is that what you told the Monger before you slaughtered him?

Id: [0x002041F5]
I tried to give you a chance.

Id: [0x002041F6]
Torture at the hands of the Cult, or a swift death by you. I hope you're well paid, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002041F9]
Well? What did the Pythia tell you?

Id: [0x002041FA]
The Cult of Kosmos is hunting me. But I'm going to hunt <i>them </i>first.

Id: [0x002041FC]
She told me they meet in a secret chamber under the Temple of Apollo.

Id: [0x002041FD]
So it's all true. [beat]If the Cult has done anything, it's fool this old man.

Id: [0x00204207]
I've killed the first Cultist, Elpenor. A snake I met in Kephallonia. His mask and cloak will get me inside the chamber.

Id: [0x00204208]
So they're underneath the Temple of Apollo... Yes, by the Cave of Gaia. I think I know the place.

Id: [0x00204209]
I can't get in without a mask and cloak. It's how the Cultists identify each other.

Id: [0x00204229]
That fort looks like a champion's stronghold.

Id: [0x0020422F]
This cave looks like it might lead inside the walls.

Id: [0x00204237]
[&ahem]Looks like I missed a fight.

Id: [0x0020423F]
It was good to see you again, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00204249]
I'm glad to hear that.

Id: [0x0020424B]
Killing these champions will weaken the Athenian hold on the region and destroy the rebels' morale.

Id: [0x00204252]
Your next opponent is Dorieus - claims to be descended from Herakles himself!

Id: [0x00204254]
The Temple of Apollo is by the Cave of Gaia - simple enough to find. But a Cultist's mask and cloak? How will you accomplish that?

Id: [0x00204255]
The Pythia gave me the only clue I need. When I'm ready, I'll meet you at the temple. For now, I'm going to kill Elpenor... <i>malákas</i> liar.

Id: [0x00204261]
So, this is it.

Id: [0x00204276]
The Cult of Kosmos doesn't deserve our mercy.

Id: [0x00204277]
Arkadia and Sparta are better off with Lagos alive.

Id: [0x00204278]
I'm in your debt, as is Sparta. You should return home soon.

Id: [0x00204285]
The Spartans weren't alone in facing Xerxes and his hoards. Many from across the Greek world were armed and ready to fight alongside Leonidas and his three hundred. But when the mighty king looked into their eyes and saw fear, he sent them home.

Id: [0x00204287]
If you close your eyes, you can hear them.

Id: [0x00204289]
Very poetic. Now can we please go to Athens? We can talk about the dead on the way.

Id: [0x0020428B]
Hold out your spear.

Id: [0x0020428C]
My spear? What for?

Id: [0x0020428D]
I need to know something.

Id: [0x002042A8]
So you execute the Monger in public against my advice, and now you kill Lagos? If you were under my command [&breath]- [/&breath]you wouldn't be, anymore.

Id: [0x002042A9]
I don't follow orders. I do what I have to.

Id: [0x002042AA]
If only you'd followed my advice with Lagos like you did with the Monger.

Id: [0x002042AB]
I don't take orders. I do what I have to do.

Id: [0x002042B8]
We have a long way to go, lamb.

Id: [0x002042CD]
I hope Arkadia can become a land of peace once more.

Id: [0x002042EA]
Ah, my friend, <i>this </i>is a courageous offer. Yes! Trying to buy my Token with such a pitiful amount of drachmae requires bravery even I do not possess.

Id: [0x002042F5]
Ah, cowardly one! How does your sniveling go? Would you like your skull and self-confidence crushed in unwinnable combat, yes? Or would bribery be your preference?

Id: [0x00204300]
What - what am I feeling? What is this?

Id: [0x00204301]
The shame of defeat.

Id: [0x00204305]
<i>This </i>is defeat?

Id: [0x00204313]
My favorite bones! You have crushed them to dust INSIDE of my skin. You ARE a champion, yes!

Id: [0x00204319]
Talk with Leiandros, challenger, then bring me your skull so that I might crush it. YES!

Id: [0x00204334]
Join me on my ship. There are more adventures for us out on the Aegean.

Id: [0x00204353]
No! Listen to me. <i>Listen! </i>Ligeia's still out there!

Id: [0x00204355]
Then he's no leader.

Id: [0x00204356]
Exactly. And if we remove the source of the problem, the problem will disappear with it. The people of Lesbos deserve to benefit from its resources.

Id: [0x00204359]
They worship the Writhing Dread. Kill them before they call its wrath upon us!

Id: [0x00204371]
They're lost in paranoia! They think I sacrificed my Ligeia to the Creature in the forest!

Id: [0x0020437A]
You -

Id: [0x00204380]
Please! The Creature took Ligeia. If I die here, who will save her?

Id: [0x00204392]
This walking curse is in league with the <i>Writhing Dread!</i>

Id: [0x00204395]
I'll save Ligeia and kill any creature that tries to stop me.

Id: [0x00204396]
Maybe the gods will save her, if they will it.

Id: [0x00204397]
<i>I </i>will it! Do not abandon Ligeia to the Writhing Dread - I'm begging you, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00204399]
Whatever it was, I didn't steal it.

Id: [0x0020439D]
The old caretaker said you -

Id: [0x0020439E]
Whoa -  he told you stuff? Did he tell you anything about my pater?

Id: [0x002043A3]
What are you saying?! She will lead you to the Petrified Temple and your doom!

Id: [0x002043A5]
Please misthios, free me! We can save Ligeia from the Writhing Dread.

Id: [0x002043A7]
Ah, you've returned! Perhaps to deliver justice to this wretched woman?

Id: [0x002043A9]
No he didn't, but -

Id: [0x002043AA]
What about the Collector?

Id: [0x002043AD]
Evil. Heartless. Unknowable.

Id: [0x002043B2]
What dark prize did the Writhing Dread offer for her soul?

Id: [0x002043B3]
She lives, <i>misthios</i>! I know it.

Id: [0x002043BC]
Look, the old caretaker said you -

Id: [0x002043BD]
Wait, wait, wait! <LF>

Id: [0x002043BF]
And... <i>Swordfish</i>?

Id: [0x002043C0]
What did he say? You found him right?

Id: [0x002043CB]
He didn't say anything about your pater either.

Id: [0x002043CC]
Huh! I could've sworn he knew something!

Id: [0x002043D2]
There was a transport ship due to arrive in port. The military consulted me for a good omen before it left. It should have been safe.

Id: [0x002043DA]
A priest from our temple snuck off to fight in the battle. He's a proud old fool, but he forgot his sword!

Id: [0x002043DE]
There have been so many more people coming to the temple since the plague. We have more offerings to the gods than we could ever hope to keep.

Id: [0x002043E6]
I was hiding Spartans in our temple during the raids. The Athenians found them in the night and dragged them out. Their general said they were coming back for me!

Id: [0x002043EA]
Those Spartan mongrels desecrate these holy lands by marching through it. This land belongs to the gods, not Sparta!

Id: [0x002043EE]
We prepared to treat injured soldiers at the temple.

Id: [0x002043F4]
So what happened to the ship?

Id: [0x002043F5]
Well, I heard it was sunk by captain who looked a lot like you. I'm sure you had your reasons, but the infantry needs the supplies that are deep in shark-infested waters.

Id: [0x00204502]
Do I look like I need training? I was sent by King Pausanias to collect the pankration champion.

Id: [0x00204503]
My apologies. I didn't realize you were here for Testikles.

Id: [0x0020450A]
Next time think before opening your mouth.

Id: [0x00204512]
Don't worry about it. I don't exactly look the part.

Id: [0x0020452A]
What happened to Leonidas after the battle?

Id: [0x0020452C]
Where were Sparta's allies?

Id: [0x00204530]
The spear awakened to you, Herodotos. I trust you.

Id: [0x00204531]
You understand... I will do everything in my power to help you find your mother, I promise. But first we must sail to the island of Andros.

Id: [0x00204542]
That's why I had to send him to the island.

Id: [0x00204576]
Uh...

Id: [0x00204578]
I'm fine. I'm fine.

Id: [0x0020457B]
The stories are true. That is the spear of Leonidas. The hero's blade.

Id: [0x00204586]
If we can find out who's manipulating Lagos, there'll be no need for blood.

Id: [0x00204588]
Find it, and I'll meet you there.

Id: [0x00204589]
Hidden chamber of the Cultists. Here, all along.

Id: [0x0020458B]
I'm going inside. Keep my clothes for me?

Id: [0x0020458C]
Best not to go in with your weapons either. I don't think they'll look too kindly on that.

Id: [0x0020458E]
How do I look?

Id: [0x0020458F]
Terrifying.

Id: [0x00204590]
Good.

Id: [0x00204591]
Find me once you've found out the truth in there. [beat]Keep your wits about you. Try not to do anything rash.

Id: [0x00204595]
Look for the Shipwreck of Nestor on the southern shore.

Id: [0x00204597]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]You're getting soft, Brasidas.

Id: [0x0020459C]
The Spartans would disagree.

Id: [0x0020459D]
Then be their curse! Bring the hate of the gods down on them, mercenary.

Id: [0x002045A0]
Battles always are. But our supplies were stolen. The goats we wanted to sacrifice, the bandages, everything. The raiders were well armed. There was nothing the priestesses could do.

Id: [0x002045A1]
Good. They're going to need it. The battle was ruthless.

Id: [0x002045B6]
I am Philonoe, and this is my son, Niloxenos. My husband is the archon, Lagos.

Id: [0x002045BB]
Did you come alone?

Id: [0x002045C3]
I should get that oil. Anything that'll make it easier to get Testikles to the Olympics.

Id: [0x0020461A]
I need some information first.

Id: [0x0020462F]
Looks like I have a horse to find.

Id: [0x0020463C]
Xerxes was famous for honoring warriors who fought valiantly against the Persians. But Leonidas infuriated him so much, he cut off his head and impaled it on a pike.

Id: [0x0020463E]
Why do you take oil to Drakon?

Id: [0x0020463F]
I didn't think he needed the help.

Id: [0x00204640]
No, although I don't know why he prefers my flammable oil over something less dangerous.

Id: [0x00204642]
Where do you deliver the oil?

Id: [0x00204643]
I deliver his shipments to his training ground near the Site of Iphigenia's Sacrifice.

Id: [0x00204644]
Where can I find these thieves?

Id: [0x00204645]
In a camp east of Snake Head Rock.

Id: [0x00204646]
He likes to have his back oiled. Makes his muscles look bigger, I suppose.

Id: [0x00204648]
You're right. Like that stunt you pulled with the artifact. It got my attention, if that's what you wanted.

Id: [0x00204649]
Right, <i>Deimos. </i>Now him, I don't know.

Id: [0x0020464A]
He's a demigod. Worshipped and feared by the Cult and all the Greek world.

Id: [0x00204651]
The Wolf was gone - I was needed. I couldn't abandon my men.

Id: [0x00204655]
You're not up to the challenge.

Id: [0x00204657]
Try me.

Id: [0x00204658]
Think you can kill them? I'd like to see you try.

Id: [0x0020465C]
Can you tell me what Spyro looks like? I want to make sure I'm stealing the right horse.

Id: [0x0020465D]
Where to begin... He's magnificent - a towering stallion as black as night, with a mane of brilliant, shimmering white hair.

Id: [0x00204666]
You saved my family from the Cult by yourself... You're courageous.

Id: [0x00204667]
Why?

Id: [0x00204670]
You've made an enemy of a king. Pausanias threatened my family with torture and death if I betrayed him.

Id: [0x00204672]
Thank you. I'll see about this king of lies.

Id: [0x00204684]
It was foretold by the Pythia that Sparta would lose either its freedom or its king to the Persians. Leonidas made his choice.

Id: [0x0020469E]
Dorieus can wait.

Id: [0x002046A3]
You sound like Brasidas when he was your age. You give me hope.

Id: [0x002046A4]
Thank you, Archon. We appreciate it.

Id: [0x002046A7]
He says you made a contract.

Id: [0x002046B0]
Pausanias?! Do you have proof?

Id: [0x002046B1]
Here - evidence of his treachery.

Id: [0x002046BF]
<i>Misthios</i>, the best I can hope for is that my wife and son are set free when the Cult has no more use for them... or me.

Id: [0x002046C0]
I'll lift the bounty on you and Myrrine. And may you find success in your fight against this evil.

Id: [0x002046E3]
The girl's coming with me. I'd suggest not standing in our way.

Id: [0x002046E4]
She's whispered spells in your ear, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002046E5]
Citizens! We must save our city!

Id: [0x002046ED]
If this "Writhing Dread" has let Ligeia live, we'll need to move now. Follow me.

Id: [0x002046EE]
Careful, these people are driven by fear.

Id: [0x002046F6]
You're safe now.

Id: [0x002046F7]
"Safe?" I don't want to be safe, <i>misthios</i>. I want to look deep into Ligeia's eyes, just once more - even if it kills me.

Id: [0x00204704]
Love might be the end of us all, but it's a price worth paying.

Id: [0x00204705]
I polished Charon's drachma long ago, <i>misthios</i>. I'm ready.

Id: [0x00204708]
You know, I don't want to call you "You" forever.

Id: [0x00204709]
My name's Bryce.

Id: [0x0020470D]
Be smart, be cautious, and with my help, you will look into your lover's eyes again. It doesn't need to cost your life.

Id: [0x00204714]
Back, you brutes! Back!

Id: [0x0020472D]
We are gathered here again for the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x00204732]
Indeed, impressive warriors from all over the Greek world have come to test their might and skill against each other.

Id: [0x0020473F]
This place was ours - Ligeia's and mine. A forbidden place for forbidden love.

Id: [0x00204744]
Whether it is the sharpest sword in the Athenian army, or the broadest shield Sparta can muster, all now stand alone against the many.

Id: [0x00204746]
At our climax, the final two will face off on a special battlefield, but only one will be called Champion. [beat]Let the Battle of One Hundred Hands begin!

Id: [0x00204749]
A <i>misthios</i>! The gods <i>are</i> real... Help me, please!

Id: [0x0020474A]
Silence, snake!

Id: [0x0020474C]
He said the key goes in the stele.

Id: [0x0020474D]
Oh! I know where the stele is! But wait -

Id: [0x0020474E]
What's this key you're talking about?

Id: [0x0020475A]
Your pater was a member of the Cult of Kosmos. Why didn't you tell me that?

Id: [0x0020475B]
Whoa! That sounds so cool!

Id: [0x0020475C]
If I knew papa was in some amazing Cult I would've bragged about it, <i>obviously</i>.

Id: [0x0020475F]
That's Melos island, right there. Where so many warriors go to die.

Id: [0x00204771]
Hide in the temple, I'll deal with this!

Id: [0x0020477A]
Uh, right! You were saying something earlier. What more do you know? Tell me!

Id: [0x0020477B]
He said you were a rude little boy that likes to interrupt -

Id: [0x0020477C]
That's not true!

Id: [0x0020477E]
Fine. <i>Maybe</i> I get a little excited sometimes.

Id: [0x0020477F]
What were you going to say?

Id: [0x00204785]
Ligeia's waiting for me, Kassandra. If I'd been captured... I'd never have to wait for her.

Id: [0x0020478E]
Then let's not disappoint her. Where was she taken?

Id: [0x0020478F]
From our sanctuary - the Dread Ruins in the Petrified Valley.

Id: [0x00204790]
And you're surprised she was taken by a Creature?!

Id: [0x00204796]
Now to find Bryce at the Dread Ruins...

Id: [0x00204798]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00204799]
I'm sorry, Bryce. I can't go just yet.

Id: [0x0020479A]
You gave me your word, malákas misthios! I'll be at the Dread Ruins in the Petrified Valley... should you find your honor.

Id: [0x002047C8]
Maybe he got out! That's why you couldn't find him!

Id: [0x002047DE]
[&ah]Light a fire, and gently heat oil of Athena. This will aid the infusion. Once the oil is warm, add a rose petal, and it's done.

Id: [0x002047EA]
Sorry. Closed.

Id: [0x002047EB]
I need oil, then I'll be on my way. There's a special one that [&ahem]Testikles uses?

Id: [0x002047EC]
Ah, for pankration fighters. That one has to be made fresh by the master, and he's gone.

Id: [0x002047EF]
I'm not leaving without it.

Id: [0x002047F1]
You don't understand. I'm nearly free...

Id: [0x002047FB]
And deal with it like you dealt with the Monger? Why not hire some musicians to entertain the crowd, too?

Id: [0x002047FC]
I know you wanted me to kill him in private. But at the time, it was the right choice.

Id: [0x002047FF]
As long as those executions are carried out quietly. Like you did with the Monger in Korinthia.

Id: [0x00204800]
Your advice was good, so I followed it, Brasidas.

Id: [0x0020480C]
Light a fire, and gently heat oil of Athena. This will aid the infusion. Once the oil is warm, add myrrh.

Id: [0x0020480E]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00204812]
Light a fire, and gently heat oil of Athena to aid the infusion. When it's warm, just add a touch of cinnamon.

Id: [0x00204818]
Let's see if I can get this right.

Id: [0x00204819]
You're going to a lot of effort for Drakon. Is he worth it?

Id: [0x0020481A]
If he's not here, where is he?

Id: [0x0020481B]
Normally we're both here night and day. The only time he leaves is to perform at the training ground.

Id: [0x0020481C]
He's a living, breathing Herakles - you tell me.

Id: [0x00204821]
That's too much trouble. Testikles can live without his oil.

Id: [0x00204823]
<i>Maláka</i>.

Id: [0x00204825]
Tell me how you met.

Id: [0x00204826]
It's a tale for the ages. I moved to Thebes with dreams of becoming a great champion. I came to this gym and saw him... A mighty warrior with an even mightier smile. I wanted to learn from the best, but the only muscle he truly worked on [beat]was my heart.

Id: [0x0020483E]
I don't need to light this...

Id: [0x00204840]
Oil of Apollo? Sounds good.

Id: [0x00204842]
This one, the oil of Athena. I'll take some of this.

Id: [0x00204844]
For the final touch, a rose petal. Testikles will smell so good.

Id: [0x00204846]
Just a bit of myrrh. Testikles is going to smell great.

Id: [0x00204848]
This smells good. Everyone loves cinnamon.

Id: [0x00204849]
It had to be heated.

Id: [0x0020484B]
I hope he appreciates this. [&ah][[sniff]][/&ah]It smells so good I almost want to keep it for myself.

Id: [0x0020484D]
You didn't bring me here to talk about dead Spartans. What's on your mind, Herodotos?

Id: [0x00204850]
The battle of Thermopylai still echoes in our hearts, but to stand here is to feel it in your bones.

Id: [0x00204868]
There's nothing here but ghosts. My concerns are with the living.

Id: [0x0020486B]
Time to get Testikles.

Id: [0x002048B8]
That sounds like madness, not bravery.

Id: [0x002048B9]
You're not hard to track.

Id: [0x002048BB]
[&snort]I'm not interested in reunion. I just want to know what you think you're doing.

Id: [0x002048BC]
Same thing as your Cult. Looking for Myrrine, our mother.

Id: [0x002048BD]
They don't need her.

Id: [0x002048BE]
Your Cultists think differently. She's their next target.

Id: [0x002048BF]
If they ever pursued her, it would be to kill her.

Id: [0x002048CB]
A bloody battle ensued, and his remains were reclaimed by the Spartans and buried here. Now, however, he rests where he belongs.

Id: [0x002048CC]
In Sparta.

Id: [0x002048D2]
Good. Be sure you take your time with it... for the potion to work best.

Id: [0x002048D7]
That's Drakon's armor out of action. Time to pay him a visit.

Id: [0x002048E1]
I cannot wait to feel my Drakon's crushing embrace again.

Id: [0x002048E7]
This must be the place, but something isn't right.

Id: [0x002048ED]
Now to return to Melanippos so he can hide Drakon's armor.

Id: [0x002048F0]
Looks like I came just in time.

Id: [0x002048F1]
You certainly did. But it's time to make a decision.

Id: [0x002048F5]
Your strategy makes sense, Brasidas.

Id: [0x002048F8]
My mother's plan is best.

Id: [0x002048F9]
Ah, my lamb. United in blood and purpose.

Id: [0x002048FC]
You're letting sentimentality cloud your judgement.

Id: [0x00204900]
You're letting your impulses overcome your reason.

Id: [0x00204914]
Even if we were abandoned, we survived. We can go back to the way things were if we can find her.

Id: [0x00204917]
Then get them off her trail. Send them after me instead.

Id: [0x00204918]
You really<i> do</i> like attention. They'll be after you soon enough, not to worry. And they'll dominate you.

Id: [0x0020491A]
I don't care what you think. I'll find Myrrine. [beat]Do the right thing. Come with me.

Id: [0x0020491B]
What?

Id: [0x0020491C]
We could find her - together. You could help me.

Id: [0x0020491D]
[&gasp]Oh, you think friendship is the answer? Running around like lost children looking for dear mater? [beat]You're so weak.

Id: [0x00205B15]
Taking your own mother isn't enough for them?

Id: [0x00205B16]
We're not abductors. We're political. Those who don't stand with us, stand against us. And they pay for that mistake.

Id: [0x00205B17]
Like me.

Id: [0x00205B18]
Like you. I heard you're planning a trip to Athens. When you go, tell Perikles and his elitist scum they're next.

Id: [0x00205B19]
You mentioned a people that came before. Who were they?

Id: [0x00205B1A]
They were not gods, but they lived far longer than any mortal and were far more intelligent.

Id: [0x00205B1B]
I've seen carvings in caves, strange symbols that suggest it was this ancient civilization that created humankind... and provided them with fire.

Id: [0x00205B1C]
But Zeus blamed Prometheus.

Id: [0x00205B1F]
Yes. Well perhaps his eagle has been feasting on the wrong liver.

Id: [0x00205B21]
Unlike your mother, I think we can handle this quietly. I'm going to begin by investigating a safe house[2155290] he keeps. There might be some evidence there.

Id: [0x002063DC]
Good. Let's set sail.

Id: [0x002063DE]
On no, can't possibly go now.

Id: [0x002063E1]
Training, see? And I don't know if I'm up to goin' sailin' on your boaty.

Id: [0x002063E2]
The Archon is no longer the man you knew. The Cult has him now.

Id: [0x002063E3]
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

Id: [0x002063EA]
Gods be with you for saving me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002063F9]
No. You couldn't.

Id: [0x002063FB]
You needed my help.

Id: [0x002063FC]
By the gods, how are you so arrogant? No wonder my father discarded you.

Id: [0x00206400]
And yet I'm here, and he isn't.

Id: [0x00206401]
You fucking murderer.

Id: [0x00206402]
Believe me, he had it coming.

Id: [0x00206404]
You know nothing about my family.

Id: [0x00206405]
I know he threw you off a cliff and chose me instead.

Id: [0x00206406]
[&ah]Now who's being arrogant? You were an afterthought - you were second place.

Id: [0x0020640A]
Don't you dare tell me what to do. I am in command here.

Id: [0x0020640B]
You will pay for what you've done.

Id: [0x0020640C]
I've already paid more than enough for one lifetime.

Id: [0x0020640D]
Now that we've driven the Athenians from the field, it's time I dealt with my true enemy.

Id: [0x0020640E]
Stentor you...

Id: [0x0020640F]
I did what I had to.

Id: [0x00206410]
And so will I.

Id: [0x00206411]
Here's the thing. I don't trust you.

Id: [0x00206417]
[&scoff]Gods no. Get on the boat.

Id: [0x00206419]
Here's your oil. Take it.

Id: [0x0020641A]
[&snort]Ah... Just like mater used to make. Will you rub it on?

Id: [0x0020641D]
That's no fair.

Id: [0x0020641F]
You don't want to use your special oil before the big fight, do you?

Id: [0x00206420]
Good point. Very good point.

Id: [0x00206421]
Let's get you to the Olympics, then.[&ah]

Id: [0x00206422]
I've got your oil... You'll get it when we arrive.

Id: [0x00206431]
You've proven your point, now finish this. I welcome death if it means I don't have to see you again.

Id: [0x00206456]
Now what oil did I need...

Id: [0x00206458]
Now the oil. I think I need...

Id: [0x0020645B]
Now what did I need?

Id: [0x0020645C]
Almost done. Now to add...

Id: [0x0020645D]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x0020645E]
You ever faced an Olympic champion before?

Id: [0x00206461]
Patience. I didn't bring you here to talk about the dead, I brought you here so you can learn to protect the living.

Id: [0x00206463]
How can I protect the living if I'm hanging around statues of lions?

Id: [0x00206465]
I've fought all sorts of people... and they were armed with more than just their fists. Let me in there.

Id: [0x00206466]
No, but I've gotten this far.

Id: [0x00206467]
Well, [&laughs]you don't look the part - you're not even oiled, for Zeus's sake!

Id: [0x0020646A]
Less talking. More fighting.

Id: [0x0020646B]
I do have some oil. It could come in handy... and it smelled good. I'll use it.

Id: [0x0020647D]
What? The artifact showed the truth. We're family, and we made it out of Sparta alive.

Id: [0x0020647E]
Yes, it did show the truth. It confirmed what I always knew. You threw me off a fucking mountain.

Id: [0x00206480]
I'm going after the Cult, you know.

Id: [0x00206483]
You've seen our numbers. You've seen what <i>I </i>can do. And you still think you stand a chance?

Id: [0x00206487]
Try me.

Id: [0x00206488]
So having guts runs in the family, does it? [beat]You claim we have the same blood, so let's see what you can do.

Id: [0x0020648E]
What happened to the traitor, Ephialtes?

Id: [0x0020648F]
King Xerxes paid him well, but treachery breeds treachery. A contract was put on his head, and he died as he lived - a coward.

Id: [0x002064AF]
You saved me, and my work, too - a cure for the statues in the Petrified Valley.

Id: [0x002065A4]
Yes! Drink it all down.

Id: [0x002065A8]
I think you're crazy.

Id: [0x002065AD]
No, no, no! You need to drink it!

Id: [0x002065C8]
They're not statues! They're my children!

Id: [0x002065CC]
These aren't petrified statues. There are dead bodies inside.

Id: [0x002065D0]
Hmm... The crazy woman has been writing about the Petrified Forest.

Id: [0x0020660F]
Has curiosity finally gotten the better of you? Will you help me make my elixir to bring the statues back to life?

Id: [0x00206610]
...By the look on your face, I'd say you don't have my ingredients yet.

Id: [0x00206615]
You're back. Do you have the ingredients?

Id: [0x00206616]
I do.

Id: [0x00206617]
Very good. Now I'll be able to make a new store of elixir.

Id: [0x00206619]
Don't be silly. Drink it and you'll be impervious to petrifaction.

Id: [0x00206650]
Where can I find these mushrooms?

Id: [0x00206651]
They grow on fresh bear dung. There's a cave[2164328] in the mountains south of the road to Mytilene, where you can usually find them.

Id: [0x00206653]
Where can I find cone snails?

Id: [0x00206654]
Cone snails are drawn to the warm currents of the eastern shoreline. My favorite spot is by Shark Bay. Make sure the bile is fresh.

Id: [0x00206657]
And these interlopers... <i>must bleed!</i>

Id: [0x0020665A]
If it does what you say it does... I'd be a fool to not drink it.

Id: [0x0020665E]
I... I'm not sure about this.

Id: [0x0020665F]
What? You believe that my elixir works, don't you?

Id: [0x00206660]
I'm not drinking anything with bear dung mushroom in it.

Id: [0x00206665]
It's huge! But if it's dead... what killed these men?

Id: [0x00206669]
Hunting gear. The men were here.

Id: [0x0020666D]
Blood... The wolf must've dragged the other man. To a cave, maybe.

Id: [0x00206671]
Who... who's there?

Id: [0x00206672]
A woman sent me to kill a giant wolf and save her husband and his friend.

Id: [0x00206673]
I'm the friend. Her husband... he's dead. We killed a giant wolf, but she was full of pups. A terrible mistake. We didn't know...

Id: [0x00206676]
What's down there?

Id: [0x00206677]
We... um... finished skinning the she-wolf, then heard a sad and terrible howl. It was the mate! It tore into my friend, then dragged me here. It's waiting...

Id: [0x00206678]
It wants revenge.

Id: [0x00206679]
You've got to kill it, or we die!

Id: [0x00206684]
You killed its mate and unborn pups. It seems fair.

Id: [0x00206685]
What? No! Don't leave me. Don't leave me!

Id: [0x00206688]
For what you two did, I think it's time you and the wolf were reacquainted.

Id: [0x00206689]
What? No! You can't! You monster. You -

Id: [0x0020668C]
I'm not here to judge - I was hired to kill a wolf. Wait here.

Id: [0x0020668D]
Oh thank you. Thank you.

Id: [0x00206692]
But first, I need to make sure it's safe for human consumption. The vial on the table is my last dose... I saved it especially for you.

Id: [0x00206694]
I found his body in the labyrinth. Your pater is dead.

Id: [0x00206695]
I didn't see any sign of him.

Id: [0x002066A7]
I'm not backing down, Leiandros.

Id: [0x002066A8]
But have... have I mentioned his biceps are as big as the Balls of Mykonos?! And, oh, his TRICEPS! Surely you don't <i>really</i> want to fight the -

Id: [0x002066A9]
Get the "Prize of Pephka" ready. When I return, every drachma in it will be mine.

Id: [0x002066AD]
If he's as tough as you say, it couldn't hurt to be more prepared. I'll be back.

Id: [0x002066B4]
A cave, a mountain, and the shoreline. Could these items be in three more different places?

Id: [0x002066BC]
Any word on my son?

Id: [0x002066C3]
You're lying.

Id: [0x002066C4]
He wouldn't just leave me alone!

Id: [0x002066C6]
What?! You didn't look hard enough.

Id: [0x002066FE]
So the honorless <i>misthios</i> returns! Are you here to tell me you'll help again, only to leave when Ligeia needs us most?

Id: [0x002066FF]
I gave my word. I'll save Ligeia and kill the Creature who took her.

Id: [0x00206702]
Ardos, he's not coming back.

Id: [0x00206704]
You said you <i>looked</i>, right?

Id: [0x00206705]
And if you couldn't find him, he must've made it out! A crack in the wall...

Id: [0x00206706]
Or, you know, he climbed out! The way you went in. Y-yeah!

Id: [0x00206708]
No.

Id: [0x0020670C]
Your pater loved you. If he got out, he'd have come to see you.

Id: [0x0020670E]
He could still be out there...

Id: [0x00206711]
Yeah. You're right! Nothing can knock down the great Nikios!

Id: [0x00206713]
Somewhere.

Id: [0x00206714]
You might be right. He could be out there somewhere.

Id: [0x00206716]
Don't ever give up looking for your family, you hear?

Id: [0x0020671A]
But, I -

Id: [0x0020671B]
I never gave up, Ardos, and I found my mother. Have faith - not just in the gods.

Id: [0x0020671C]
But in yourself.

Id: [0x0020671F]
I can't -

Id: [0x00206720]
I will never stop looking for my own mater, Ardos. We need to have faith. Not just in the gods -

Id: [0x00206721]
But in ourselves.

Id: [0x00206729]
Are you OK, Ardos?

Id: [0x0020672A]
I... just wish I had something to remember him by.

Id: [0x0020672B]
Sometimes, I -

Id: [0x0020672D]
I forget what he looks like. What he sounded like.

Id: [0x0020673B]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x0020673C]
I don't know, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020673E]
Without <i>pater</i>...

Id: [0x0020673F]
I don't know.

Id: [0x0020676A]
What's your plan now?

Id: [0x0020676B]
I'm going to keep looking for <i>pater</i>! Do you think any of the others will know where he went?

Id: [0x00206776]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x00206777]
I... I see.

Id: [0x0020677E]
You said your pater went into the labyrinth to find valuables.

Id: [0x00206781]
I found this. Take it.

Id: [0x00206783]
It isn't much, but maybe I will have helped him fulfill his promise.

Id: [0x00206785]
T-thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00206787]
You'll find your own path, Ardos.

Id: [0x00206788]
I-I guess.

Id: [0x00206789]
But for starters, stop going around stealing so you can keep all your fingers.

Id: [0x0020678A]
Ha! You know I can't promise you that, misthios!

Id: [0x0020678B]
You are never alone, Ardos. There are always people who care.

Id: [0x0020678C]
Ardos...

Id: [0x0020678D]
Will you be OK?

Id: [0x0020678E]
Yes. <i>Pater's</i> out there like you said, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020678F]
And it's up to me to find him.

Id: [0x00206793]
Tyche be with you, Ardos.

Id: [0x00206794]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! I'll find him for sure.

Id: [0x00206799]
I know you will find him, Ardos.

Id: [0x0020679A]
I'll tell pater all about you.

Id: [0x002067A3]
You notice Lagos acting strange before he left?

Id: [0x002067A4]
He's been on edge ever since our... problem at the outpost.

Id: [0x002067A6]
These must be the silos. There's enough grain in here to feed hundreds of hungry soldiers.

Id: [0x002067AA]
The path of betrayal. This is where that traitor snuck the Persian army past Sparta's defenses.

Id: [0x002067AF]
Taking this path feels as if <i>I'm</i> betraying Sparta, too.

Id: [0x002067BE]
That hatch on top looks like it'll burn, and the wheat will catch after.

Id: [0x002067D2]
That's a fire even Hephaestus would be proud of.

Id: [0x002073F7]
Good, now two more left to burn.

Id: [0x002073FC]
[&ah]Only one left.

Id: [0x00207401]
That settles it. Without grain, Lagos won't be able to feed his troops - or pay for more.

Id: [0x00207414]
Tell me where my <i>mater</i> is and you may walk out of here alive.

Id: [0x00207415]
Speak!

Id: [0x00207416]
You'll find them on a hill - a cliff overlooking Tegea.

Id: [0x00207418]
You show mercy. Arkadia will give you none in return.

Id: [0x0020749C]
Tell me where my mother is or I'll shove my spear so far down your throat, you'll be shitting iron at the gates of Hades!

Id: [0x0020749D]
[&scream]Speak![/&scream]

Id: [0x0020749E]
They're on a hill - a cliff overlooking Tegea.

Id: [0x002074A3]
Please! Show mercy!

Id: [0x002074AB]
Tell me who the Archon is. I want a name.

Id: [0x002074AC]
[&laughs][[laughs]][/&laughs]Lagos. His name is Lagos. And he's the most powerful man in Arkadia - he who controls the grain, controls the world.

Id: [0x00207788]
I don't threaten, I promise!

Id: [0x0020778D]
[&breath]Brasidas was betrayed, and there's a bounty on my head. I need to find them before anyone else does.

Id: [0x00207B4A]
Stepping into a dead man's sandals... and Testikles isn't even digested yet.

Id: [0x00207B56]
Stentor, she owes me nothing.

Id: [0x00207BC8]
Maybe you can figure it out together.

Id: [0x00207BCB]
Stay out of trouble, boy.

Id: [0x00207BCC]
You know I can't promise you that!

Id: [0x00207BCD]
I'll make sure of it, <i>misthios</i>. Thank you.

Id: [0x00207BCF]
Remember, you're never alone. There will always be people who care.

Id: [0x00207BD1]
Look who's here.

Id: [0x00207BD4]
Ardos...

Id: [0x00207BD6]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. He's in good hands now.

Id: [0x00207BDC]
The <i>misthios</i> didn't find <i>pater</i> in the labyrinth. He must have gotten out!

Id: [0x00207BDE]
That's wonderful news, boy. Where do you think we should start looking?

Id: [0x00207BDF]
I'll think of something!

Id: [0x00207BE0]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! I won't ever forget you!

Id: [0x00207BE3]
I couldn't tell him.

Id: [0x00207BE4]
You've done enough, <i>misthios</i>. Let me handle the rest.

Id: [0x00207BE7]
The <i>misthios</i> couldn't find <i>pater</i>. He must have found a way out!

Id: [0x00207BE8]
Is that so?

Id: [0x00207BE9]
There was no sign of him in the labyrinth.

Id: [0x00207BEB]
Come on! We've got to start looking!

Id: [0x00207BEC]
Thanks, <i>misthios</i>. You're the best.

Id: [0x00207BED]
You will find your pater. I know it.

Id: [0x00207BF0]
It's nothing personal with the boy or the old man, but if I tell you anything, I'm good as -

Id: [0x00207BF1]
Dead?

Id: [0x00207BF3]
OK! What is it you want to know?

Id: [0x00207BF5]
Guess what'll happen if you <i>don't </i>tell me anything?

Id: [0x00207BFB]
Where is the old man?

Id: [0x00207BFC]
They're at Phaistos Village, southwest of here. They got him tied to a post and they're beating him.

Id: [0x00207C01]
What is to happen to the boy?

Id: [0x00207C02]
I don't know, <i>misthios</i>! They just told me to bring him back!

Id: [0x00207C04]
But we both know what they're capable of...

Id: [0x00207C05]
And you'd bring them an innocent boy?

Id: [0x00207C08]
You'd stand by as an old man gets beaten -

Id: [0x00207C09]
B-but -

Id: [0x00207C0A]
<i>And</i> you agreed to kidnap the boy.

Id: [0x00207C0C]
They're just up the road - the Cult! Go kill them all. You'd be doing me favor, too.

Id: [0x00207C0D]
Let me go, and I won't tell anyone what happened.

Id: [0x00207C20]
I'll let Zeus decide your fate. I need to find the old man.

Id: [0x00207C21]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00207C24]
You put innocent people in harm's way.

Id: [0x00207C25]
You won't get out of this alive.

Id: [0x00207C28]
Stay away!

Id: [0x00207C2B]
W-wait, who are you?

Id: [0x00207C2C]
Ardos sent me. Can you walk?

Id: [0x00207C2F]
What I can do in Nikios's honor is to stop his son from entering that cursed place!

Id: [0x00207C31]
I've failed him. I've failed him all these years.

Id: [0x00207C35]
As smart as he is, he still needs someone to look out for him -  family.

Id: [0x00207C37]
He doesn't even want to see me, <i>misthios</i> -

Id: [0x00207C38]
Keep trying.

Id: [0x00207C3C]
He needs you.

Id: [0x00207C42]
It appears you don't have enough.

Id: [0x00207C5C]
Where are we?

Id: [0x00207C65]
We enter the realm of the Writhing Dread. Listen... It's as if sound itself is afraid of what the fog veils.

Id: [0x00207C68]
It destroys all living things, transforming them to stone and leaving them frozen in fear for all eternity.

Id: [0x00207C6B]
If Ligeia - if she's... if she's stone, how will we bury her? She'll never meet Charon.

Id: [0x00207C6D]
Ligeia? LIGEIA!

Id: [0x00207C84]
We need to get inside, but I see no openings... and the walls are too smooth to climb.

Id: [0x00207C94]
Ligeia! That's her! Kassandra, she's alive.

Id: [0x00207C95]
It could be Ligeia, alive - or a siren's call to our deaths.

Id: [0x00207C96]
<i>Coward!</i> I know my lover's voice! I won't let her down... even if you will.

Id: [0x00207C97]
That scream came from someone in mortal danger. By now -

Id: [0x00207C98]
<i>Malákas misthios</i>! You know nothing of love or hope. I will be with Ligeia again, in life or in death!

Id: [0x00207CA0]
If that was Ligeia, she's beyond my help. I wouldn't hold out much hope for her. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00207CA4]
Ligeia's still trapped and -

Id: [0x00207CA6]
She shouldn't be in there. She should be in my arms. Her breath, her smell...

Id: [0x00207CA8]
Every night we'd meet at the Dread Ruins. I was late, just once. I wanted to find her a rose - something as perfect as she is.

Id: [0x00207CAA]
Then you'd <i>both</i> be trapped inside.

Id: [0x00207CAC]
Together.

Id: [0x00207CAD]
You were searching for a rose, a gift. Never regret an act of kindness, Bryce.

Id: [0x00207CAF]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00207CB0]
This <i>is </i>your fault - what were you thinking meeting in a cursed valley full of fog?

Id: [0x00207CB1]
We didn't believe the stories -

Id: [0x00207CB2]
You invited death. And when it answered, Ligeia faced it alone.

Id: [0x00207CB4]
But I will make it right.

Id: [0x00207CB5]
What do you know about this place?

Id: [0x00207CB6]
Ligeia's a Daughter of Artemis. Her people trained here long ago. A legend tells of an ancient artifact they recovered in a pit full of snakes. She believed they still had it, hidden in their village[2416852] on Chios.

Id: [0x00207CB7]
I'll find it.

Id: [0x00207CB8]
There's also a mercenary, a man who claims he killed the Creature -

Id: [0x00207CB9]
Impossible.

Id: [0x00207CBA]
But many believe him - he might know something.

Id: [0x00207CBB]
This job is about power - the power to rule Gortyn by starting a war.

Id: [0x00207CBC]
Just one head... There's a visiting herald from Phaistos. No doubt here to broker peace with Gortyn.

Id: [0x00207CBE]
His murder will guarantee that war is the only option for Gortyn.

Id: [0x00207CBF]
Tell me about the supplies I should destroy.

Id: [0x00207CC1]
The weapon racks and supplies in Daidalos Fort must be destroyed to ensure they don't win the war.  <LF>

Id: [0x00207D23]
You called me "<i>misthios</i>" - you must know my help comes at a price.

Id: [0x00207D24]
The people who did this to me - they took everything I had and left me for dead!

Id: [0x00207D25]
They've got plenty of other treasures and trinkets at their hideouts, too! Free me, and I'll tell you where to find them.

Id: [0x00207D26]
You've got to free me before those vultures peck my eyes out! Not to mention the wolves! I saw them in the bushes earlier.

Id: [0x00207D27]
You don't look like you're in much of a... position to pay.

Id: [0x00207D29]
W-wait! Hear me out!

Id: [0x00207D30]
Find someone else to do your avenging.

Id: [0x00207D31]
Please, come back, misthios! There are riches are beyond your imagination.

Id: [0x00207D35]
You're alive <i>and</i> free. Now tell me about my reward.

Id: [0x00207D36]
Those <i>malákes</i> took my only prized possession. A family heirloom - an amulet handed down from my mother.

Id: [0x00207D3F]
Which one of the thugs took your amulet?

Id: [0x00207D40]
They keep their spoils underwater in a cave[2106106] just west of here.

Id: [0x00207D42]
Who left you like this?

Id: [0x00207D45]
The Followers of Ares! I joined them thinking I could get rich quick.

Id: [0x00207D46]
But the sacrifices and murders, <i>misthios</i>... It's terrible. I tried to sneak away with some of their stuff -

Id: [0x00207D47]
And got caught.

Id: [0x00207D48]
You've got to kill them all, <i>misthios</i>. They're crazy.

Id: [0x00207D49]
Let the hunt begin.

Id: [0x00207D4A]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Knowing that they are dead will help me sleep easier.

Id: [0x00207D54]
<i>Misthios</i>! Set me free and I'll see you are rewarded. The birds are getting braver and the wolves, hungrier.

Id: [0x00207D56]
I've already told you all I know!

Id: [0x00207DAB]
What do you need?

Id: [0x00207DAC]
Peace of mind.

Id: [0x00207DAD]
And <i>revenge</i>.

Id: [0x00207DAE]
Can you bring me this, <i>misthios</i>? We will give you all the drachmae we have.

Id: [0x00207DB3]
I need more information first.

Id: [0x00207DB7]
The Followers of Ares are burning our villages and claiming our families for their sacrifices.

Id: [0x00207DB9]
Be <i>avenged</i>.

Id: [0x00207DBA]
Those <i>malákes</i> are making trouble all over the Greek world.

Id: [0x00207DBF]
I don't have time to help you.

Id: [0x00207DC0]
It's not just<i> me </i>who needs your help, <i>misthios</i>, it's my entire village.

Id: [0x00207DC1]
Please <i>misthios</i>, just a moment of your time. We need your help.

Id: [0x00207DC4]
I'll need to know where the Followers are hiding.

Id: [0x00207DC5]
Where did you say I could find the Followers of Ares?

Id: [0x00207DC6]
But we cannot leave you without showing our gratitude. Please take this. I have no need for it any longer.

Id: [0x00207DC8]
It seems like the training has paid off.

Id: [0x00207DC9]
I was about to say the same.

Id: [0x00207DCA]
Maybe we don't have to do this.

Id: [0x00207DCC]
Enough chatter. Our patrons demand a champion. Finish this!

Id: [0x00207DD0]
We can lay down our weapons. There's nothing more to prove.

Id: [0x00207DD1]
This is outrageous.

Id: [0x00207DD2]
Roxana - only one of you can win the Battle and become champion.

Id: [0x00207DD4]
Then we'll finish this as per tradition. With one champion above the rest.

Id: [0x00207DD5]
When this is over, I will make an offering to Athena in your honor.

Id: [0x00207DD7]
We both came here to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x00207DDB]
I'm beginning to think there are things more important than riches and glory.

Id: [0x00208092]
I will! I will join you!

Id: [0x00208093]
No! You must finish the battle!

Id: [0x00208094]
It's over, Drakios.

Id: [0x00208095]
It's over when I say it's over. Guards!

Id: [0x00208097]
I'm here to win.

Id: [0x00208098]
So be it.

Id: [0x0020809D]
Well done, <i>misthios</i>. We should return to the city for your ceremony.

Id: [0x0020809E]
First I want the information you promised me.

Id: [0x0020809F]
Truth is, <i>misthios</i>, the Battle of One Hundred Hands was always a bit of a trap. Indeed, we've been doing it for years, hoping to draw out the sibling of the warrior Deimos.

Id: [0x002080A2]
You've found me.

Id: [0x002080A3]
As I suspected.

Id: [0x002080A4]
And you know what I'm capable of.

Id: [0x002080A5]
Indeed, I do.

Id: [0x002080A6]
I've killed many people today, Drakios. I can make it one more.

Id: [0x002080A8]
Today is the day I earn a big bonus from the masked ones. I was hoping we could do this elsewhere, but -

Id: [0x002080A9]
I have plenty of fight left.

Id: [0x002080AB]
That all means nothing to me.

Id: [0x002080AC]
Oh, come now, <i>misthios</i>. We <i>have</i> found you. Indeed, everything's gone according to plan.

Id: [0x002080AF]
Maybe I'll do it later.

Id: [0x00208A19]
Thank you, champion.

Id: [0x00208A1A]
So, I'll see you at my ship?

Id: [0x00208A1B]
Yes. I'm ready to go wherever the sea wind takes us.

Id: [0x00208A1C]
Wherever it is, adventure awaits. For both of us, now.

Id: [0x00208A29]
<i>"Someone, I tell you, in another time will remember us."</i>

Id: [0x00208A2A]
The poet Sappho.

Id: [0x00208A2C]
Our favorite. Please, Kassandra. Hurry.

Id: [0x00208A38]
The Mercenary knew nothing. He never made it inside the lair.

Id: [0x00208A39]
Then it was a waste of time! Ligeia waits, and we've done nothing to help her!

Id: [0x00208A3A]
Not exactly - the Mercenary carried this spear, which he claims killed the Writhing Dread.

Id: [0x00208A3B]
No, no, the Creature took Ligeia! It <i>can't</i> be dead - it awaits in its lair, even now!

Id: [0x00208A3C]
Then there may be a piece of this puzzle we don't yet understand.

Id: [0x00208A41]
Well? What else did the Mercenary know? How do we get inside to save Ligeia and kill the Creature?

Id: [0x00208A42]
I found the Mercenary. Just another man obsessed with his spear.

Id: [0x00208A47]
Aren't they all?

Id: [0x00208A48]
Then who knows what vital clue you may have missed?!

Id: [0x00208A4B]
I didn't question him very thoroughly. ...Or take his spear.

Id: [0x00208A5C]
My husband hasn't returned. Please tell me he's coming.

Id: [0x00208A6A]
...No. I'm not walking in there without talking to the Mercenary first. He might know something we could use.

Id: [0x00208A6B]
He might know how not to be a <i>coward!</i> Kassandra, Ligeia needs us now! Open the door. Open it!

Id: [0x00208A78]
Your husband is dead.

Id: [0x00208A79]
No!<LF>

Id: [0x00208A85]
Too much time has been wasted. We need to open that door, now.

Id: [0x00208A86]
And all without gaining every advantage from the Mercenary first? Perhaps you have found your courage.

Id: [0x00208A88]
I haven't found it yet, but I will.

Id: [0x00208A89]
Please hurry, there hasn't been - I can't hear anything inside the lair. It's gone quiet.

Id: [0x00208A8B]
Did Ligeia's people have the key?

Id: [0x00208A8E]
Then what are you waiting for? Use the disk! Open the door!

Id: [0x00208A8F]
Ligeia's story was true. The Daughters of Artemis were protecting this... Disk... Key? This -

Id: [0x00208A90]
Your son is dead, drowned in your own fishing nets. He died trying to impress his sour father, who pushed him too hard.

Id: [0x00208A91]
My fault... You think it's my fault? Get out of my shop. Go!

Id: [0x00208A93]
My poor boy! What did I do? What did I do?

Id: [0x00208A99]
And... You didn't hurt any of the Daughters when you took it?

Id: [0x00208A9F]
This disk was well protected, in a place where they keep their finest valuables. They were never going to just hand it over.

Id: [0x00208AA0]
So - so you killed -

Id: [0x00208AA1]
This is the price, Bryce. Their lives for Ligeia's.

Id: [0x00208AA4]
I - oh no, no, no... They were our friends - Ligeia's family.

Id: [0x00208AA5]
Then I hope she's worth it.

Id: [0x00208AA6]
I was very careful - none of the Daughters even knew I was there.

Id: [0x00208AA8]
I thank you for your mercy. Some of those women are my best friends and Ligeia's sisters - her family.

Id: [0x00208AA9]
Then know that they're safe.

Id: [0x00208AAF]
They didn't hear me or my blades... but they felt them, Bryce.

Id: [0x00208AB0]
Why?! Why would you -

Id: [0x00208AB1]
This disk is a prized possession - if I hadn't killed them, I never would have made it out alive, and Ligeia would be lost.

Id: [0x00208AB2]
I - I suppose you did what you had to. Ligeia's worth any price.

Id: [0x00208AB4]
There was no need for violence. The Daughters of Artemis didn't even know I was there.

Id: [0x00208AB5]
Then Tyche truly is on our side. Ligeia still stands a chance.

Id: [0x00208AC0]
I'll need to sail to Chios island to get the bear skins.

Id: [0x00208AC4]
You said Ligeia knew how to get into the lair - where exactly is the key?

Id: [0x00208AC5]
The Daughters of Artemis hide their most prized possessions in a cave in their village[2416852]. It's protected by wild beasts and fierce warriors.

Id: [0x00208AC6]
This mercenary, the "Slayer of the Writhing Dread," where can I find him?

Id: [0x00208AC7]
He waits in a temple[2392624] atop the hill in Ancient Pearl. Champions from all over seek to challenge him to build their reputations, but there's no way he killed the Creature. If he did, how was Ligeia taken?

Id: [0x00208AC8]
The Mercenary's on a... mountain somewhere?

Id: [0x00208AC9]
At the temple[2392624] atop the hill in Ancient Pearl. How are you supposed to save Ligeia if you can't even remember a simple name?!

Id: [0x00208ACD]
The workers will make a full recovery thanks to you.

Id: [0x00208ACF]
Did you see the Creature yourself?

Id: [0x00208AD0]
No, but only the Writhing Dread would be strong enough to take Ligeia! She's too fierce.

Id: [0x00208AD2]
...And too stubborn.

Id: [0x00208AD4]
No! Nice wolf! Nice wolf! No -

Id: [0x00208AD5]
Hunter, meet wolf. Wolf, <i>eat</i> hunter!

Id: [0x00208AD9]
I'll find a way inside, and then I'll kill this Creature.

Id: [0x00208ADB]
And I'll find Ligeia the rose I should have given her that night.

Id: [0x00208ADF]
I'll be back.

Id: [0x00208AE0]
With answers, not questions, I hope.

Id: [0x00208AE2]
Tell me again where I can find the key to the lair.

Id: [0x00208AE3]
Again?! Fine. In the Daughters' village[2416852], there is a cave where they protect all sorts of treasures. If they have the key - a disk - that's where it'll be.

Id: [0x00208AE5]
This is my fault. If I'd gotten there in time -

Id: [0x00208AEE]
My husband... Where is he?

Id: [0x00208AF5]
Your husband and his friend were killed by the giant wolf <i>after</i> he killed its mate and unborn pups. I chose not to kill it.

Id: [0x00208AF6]
No! I hired you to protect them. If I see you again, I'll put a contract on your head!

Id: [0x00208B00]
Did you find anything, coward?

Id: [0x00208B0B]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!<LF>

Id: [0x00208B0E]
Have you tried making an offering?

Id: [0x00208B0F]
A simple offering isn't enough to appease him! We need to perform a ritual... but we can't do it without our ceremonial axe.

Id: [0x00208B10]
I told you what would happen if I ever saw you again.<LF>

Id: [0x00208B78]
Please, accept this drachmae as thanks. I tried to trade it for my freedom, but those crazy <i>malákes</i> only wanted my blood.

Id: [0x00208B7A]
[&ah]I have what opens the lair.

Id: [0x00208B7B]
I found the Mercenary's spear. He says it was made for the slaying of mythical beasts.

Id: [0x00208B82]
Bryce! Wait!

Id: [0x00208B84]
Ligeia! LIGEIA!!!

Id: [0x00208B86]
<i>Maláka.</i>

Id: [0x00208B93]
Ligeia! Where are you?!

Id: [0x00208B95]
Please, say something!

Id: [0x00208B97]
Do you remember the poems we read to each other? Do you remember our promise?

Id: [0x00208B99]
I'm sorry I wasn't there that night. I'm sorry I was late.

Id: [0x00208B9B]
Don't forgive me, just find me.

Id: [0x00208B9E]
I brought you a rose. Just - follow my voice. Find me... and I'll give it to you.

Id: [0x00208BA0]
I - I hear you, my love! Look at me, Ligeia! Please, just look me in the eye...

Id: [0x00208BA5]
Bryce! You have no idea what you're - <i>BRYCE!</i>

Id: [0x00208BAA]
Let's head home first. Maybe something there will help us find your pater.

Id: [0x00208BAB]
Home?

Id: [0x00208BAC]
Yes, <i>our</i> home. Let's go.

Id: [0x00208BAF]
I'm not sure where to start looking, but I'll figure something out!

Id: [0x00208BB2]
Let's go home, Ardos.

Id: [0x00208BB3]
I'd like that.

Id: [0x00208BB6]
I'll be OK, <i>misthios</i>. I have to be, right?

Id: [0x00208BC1]
"Someone, I tell you, in another time will remember us."

Id: [0x00208BC4]
There's no time for the Mercenary. Whatever he knows we'll find out ourselves. We're opening that door, now.

Id: [0x00208BC5]
You have Ligeia's heart, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00208BCB]
Time to search Fisherman's Bay.

Id: [0x00208C57]
You mean the treasures at the Followers of Ares hideout?

Id: [0x00208C58]
O-Oh.

Id: [0x00208C59]
The treasure underwater? Yeah, I got it all. What else do you have to offer?

Id: [0x00208C5C]
Well, no, there's much more!

Id: [0x00208C62]
I'll go get the tools and drugs.

Id: [0x00208C75]
If you'll pay my fee... The health of your workers depends on it.

Id: [0x00208C76]
Yes, yes. Of course I'll reward you. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00208C78]
I'd have hoped the wellbeing of these people would be payment enough.

Id: [0x00208C79]
I wouldn't want them to suffer.

Id: [0x00208C7A]
Well said. Such goodwill deserves a reward, doesn't it?

Id: [0x00208C7B]
Hmm...? Oh! Of course. Of course. I have something worthwhile to trade for the service. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00208C86]
As the new Leader, the wolves will submit to <i>my</i> will.

Id: [0x00208C87]
You're not -

Id: [0x00208C88]
Yes. I crushed Daphnae in ritual combat. Your life and your beasts belong to me.

Id: [0x00208C8B]
Wolf meat approaches! Toned muscle - should keep the pack chewing for hours.

Id: [0x00208C8C]
<i>Our </i>pack. I defeated Daphnae in combat and earned her title.

Id: [0x00208C8D]
No, there's no way <i>you -</i>

Id: [0x00208C8F]
We're family now, sister.

Id: [0x00208C9C]
How may we serve you?

Id: [0x00208C9D]
I am a friend of Bryce and Ligeia -

Id: [0x00208C9E]
Ligeia?! What's nearly eaten her this week?

Id: [0x00208C9F]
The Writhing Dread.

Id: [0x00208CA0]
What's ours is yours, Eagle Bearer. You can enter the cave and take the disk, but know I am not its only guardian.

Id: [0x00208CA1]
...Wolves?

Id: [0x00208CA2]
Bears.

Id: [0x00208CA4]
<i>Maláka</i>.

Id: [0x00208CA8]
You guard a disk that opens the Creature's lair on Lesbos. I need it to save her.

Id: [0x00208CAD]
This looks like the cave Bryce mentioned. The key to the Writhing Dread's lair must be down here.

Id: [0x00208CB2]
The key's not here. Must be in another cave.

Id: [0x00208CB6]
No key. I'll keep looking.

Id: [0x00208CBA]
I get the feeling that's all you've cared about from the start.

Id: [0x00208DEC]
Without his guards to protect him, Lagos will be vulnerable.

Id: [0x00209A10]
Typical Spartan... Don't understand that honey can get you more than vinegar.

Id: [0x00209A12]
The Cult let Myrrine live. They let Nikolaos live. Why kill them now?

Id: [0x00209A13]
Because you live. You brought this on her and yourself. The Cult is powerful, but they're mortals. I have the blood of gods, so they think you do, too.

Id: [0x00209A38]
I can't imagine what would make your husband do that.

Id: [0x00209A39]
If a man forsakes his family for any price, he's no better than a beast.

Id: [0x00209A3A]
Kassandra, a shadow grows across Sparta. Be cautious when you return.

Id: [0x00209A3B]
<i>Mater</i> and I will deal with it.

Id: [0x00209A3C]
You found her?

Id: [0x00209A3D]
Ruling Naxos.

Id: [0x00209A3E]
Sounds like her. [beat]May the gods watch over you both.

Id: [0x00209A41]
...Watch this.

Id: [0x00209A4B]
This looks like the camp. Time to send some guards to Hades.

Id: [0x00209A55]
The fort at last. Should find a quiet way in.

Id: [0x00209A57]
We've been trapped in this filthy cave for days with no word from Lagos whatsoever.

Id: [0x00209A62]
Thermopylai... They say you can't walk this battlefield without getting blood on your toes.

Id: [0x00209A72]
Please, take us with you. I can help my husband.

Id: [0x00209A73]
It's too dangerous. You should go meet with Brasidas instead, at the safe house[2155290] northeast of Tegea.

Id: [0x00209A76]
Oh?

Id: [0x00209A77]
King Pausanias asked me to bring the pankration champion to Elis.

Id: [0x00209A78]
And what of us? I can't go back to that wretch, and now that these guards are dead, we're in danger.

Id: [0x00209A79]
For now, go to my friend, Brasidas. He'll meet you at the safe house[2155290] northeast of Tegea.

Id: [0x00209A7A]
Where Lagos has his secret meetings...

Id: [0x00209A7B]
[&breath][deep breath][/&breath]I am grateful you saved us. We'll go find Brasidas. Chaire.

Id: [0x00209A7C]
Are you angry, <i>mater</i>?

Id: [0x00209A7F]
Go see my friend Brasidas at the safe house[2155290] northeast of Tegea, and I can promise you'll be safe.

Id: [0x00209A8B]
I know I'm asking for a lot, but I need this oil <i>now</i>. I could come back and talk to your master - maybe explain the situation?

Id: [0x00209A8C]
What choice do I have? It's not bad, this life, if I have to stay...

Id: [0x00209A8D]
Tell me, or I'll make you.

Id: [0x00209A8E]
Why would a <i>misthios</i> care about a slave? I'll tell you, but not help you.

Id: [0x00209AA1]
If it's a question of drachmae, I can pay you for the oil.

Id: [0x00209AA2]
It's a question of trust. I know my master. He's kind, but strict. My freedom depends on it.

Id: [0x00209AA5]
I was brought here with Lagos's family. I thought we'd be killed!

Id: [0x00209AA6]
Where are they?

Id: [0x00209AA7]
Below ground, with many guards.

Id: [0x00209AA8]
I need you to go tell my friend Brasidas I've found them. He should be in an old farmhouse northeast of Tegea.

Id: [0x00209AA9]
I'll do it. Thank the gods you came to help us!

Id: [0x00209AB1]
You're a slave?

Id: [0x00209AB2]
Yes, and in a good position. Doing this would be stealing from him.

Id: [0x00209AB3]
Don't worry. I won't get you into trouble.

Id: [0x00209ABC]
I'll give you the recipe, but that's as far as I go. You make it yourself.

Id: [0x00209ABD]
I can do that.

Id: [0x00209ABF]
Maláka! Get out.[&spit][spit][/&spit]

Id: [0x00209AC1]
After all that - nearly throwing away my freedom - it was too much work for you?

Id: [0x00209AC6]
Nobody came to claim the bounty on your head. I thought I was very generous.

Id: [0x00209AC7]
I must admit, I was flattered to learn I was worth so much. Arkadia really is prosperous.

Id: [0x00209AC8]
It is... I was a very good administrator. I never meant to be a warlord.

Id: [0x00209AC9]
What changed?

Id: [0x00209ACC]
Don't worry, we will.

Id: [0x00209AD6]
We got lucky this time. The pirates weren't the toughest I've faced.

Id: [0x00209AD7]
What can I say, I'm good at my job.

Id: [0x00209AD9]
Be that as it may, we certainly couldn't have done it without you.

Id: [0x00209ADB]
My friend, Swordfish would have me fed to the sharks before Poseidon could punish me.

Id: [0x00209B58]
Swordfish will have my head!

Id: [0x00209B5F]
Swordfish... Tell me more about him.

Id: [0x00209B61]
Swordfish? Who's that?

Id: [0x00209B68]
I can't say any more. No one talks about Swordfish and gets away with it, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00209B6C]
What if I insist?

Id: [0x00209B6D]
Then <i>I</i> insist you retrieve the axe for me.

Id: [0x00209B74]
I don't have time for your games, priestess.

Id: [0x00209B75]
I'll pay you, <i>misthios</i>! If you don't help me, I'm dead.

Id: [0x00209B77]
You're talking about the Writhing Dread?

Id: [0x00209B78]
The Creature.

Id: [0x00209B7B]
N-no! "<i>Politely request."</i> And of course there'll be plenty of drachmae for your help, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00209B7C]
Do you know where the axe is?

Id: [0x00209B7E]
There's a cave[2106110] east of town. If you follow the path along the shoreline, I'm sure you'll find them.

Id: [0x00209B7F]
Bandits took it!

Id: [0x00209B81]
I'll go take a look.

Id: [0x00209B83]
He's the one who ordered us to conduct this ritual every month. He runs the fish market -

Id: [0x00209B85]
When it ambushed us outside, we thought only of survival. My spear allowed me to stay out of its gaze. I was lucky. My friends weren't.

Id: [0x00209B86]
<i>You</i> insist?

Id: [0x00209B8A]
I've seen more romantic funerals.

Id: [0x00209B8C]
I - [&gasp]I need your help.

Id: [0x00209B90]
This? You call this an <i>axe</i>? It could barely shave a man's beard.

Id: [0x00209B92]
I've seen my share of axes, and this hardly qualifies, priestess.

Id: [0x00209B95]
The axe is in a cave[2106110] to the east, <i>misthios</i>. Please hurry!

Id: [0x00209B98]
The Arkalochori Axe! Thank the gods. Swordfish will be pleased. Let me look more closely...

Id: [0x00209B9A]
Not so fast.

Id: [0x00209B9C]
What do you want, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00209B9D]
What I'm owed.

Id: [0x00209BA6]
It might be worth returning to see what he knows...

Id: [0x00209BA8]
He'll kill me if I tell you.

Id: [0x00209BA9]
And I'll kill you if you don't.

Id: [0x00209BAB]
Who is this Swordfish you want to impress?

Id: [0x00209BAC]
Swordfish has always run the fish market with an iron fist - charges the fishermen fees. If they don't pay up... the sharks eat well.

Id: [0x00209BAD]
Why do you fear Swordfish?

Id: [0x00209BAE]
Everyone does, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00209BAF]
He's not to be trifled with. Once, he took a man's nose off for sneezing in his presence.

Id: [0x00209BB1]
Quite the reputation...

Id: [0x00209BB5]
Point me in Swordfish's direction.

Id: [0x00209BB6]
I don't know where he is. No one's seen him for years, <i>misthios</i>. Some think he's dead.

Id: [0x00209BB7]
Just last week, some fishermen boldly said we should no longer pay fees to a dead man...

Id: [0x00209BB8]
Guess who's dead now?

Id: [0x00209BBA]
Remind me where Swordfish is.

Id: [0x00209BBB]
Try your luck at Fisherman's Beacon to the north - he used to live there.

Id: [0x00209BC2]
Have you found a way inside the lair?

Id: [0x00209BC5]
This axe would fetch a good price at the agora.

Id: [0x00209BC8]
Then let the slaying begin.

Id: [0x00209BC9]
The cowardly <i>misthios</i>! What terribly important items might you need now, before you keep your promise to save my lover?

Id: [0x00209BCB]
Tell me where to find the headgear.

Id: [0x00209BCC]
You'll find it around the hut of the Daughters' most favored huntress, near the center of their village.

Id: [0x00209BCD]
No! You can't sell it. Give it back - I'll pay you. Take all the drachmae I have.

Id: [0x00209BD3]
The axe was yours to begin with. Take it.

Id: [0x00209BD4]
You had me worried, <i>misthios</i>. Thank you, I owe you my life.

Id: [0x00209BD7]
I'll do what I want with it. It's mine now.

Id: [0x00209BD8]
You'd let someone die for your greed? Watch yourself, <i>maláka</i>, your head looks like it would fetch a pretty price.

Id: [0x00209C40]
...I will remember, Bryce.

Id: [0x00209C46]
I noticed something while testing the elixir on my live subjects... We all turn to stone <i>when we're dead</i>!

Id: [0x00209C50]
Need something else to find that axe, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00209CDA]
Problem solved!

Id: [0x00209CDC]
But his presence is felt everywhere in Heraklion. He's here, somewhere.

Id: [0x00209CE3]
Just leave me be...

Id: [0x00209CEB]
But she met the ferryman before me, misthios. I never made good on my promise.

Id: [0x00209CEC]
It was always one thing or another, you know?

Id: [0x00209CEE]
Children, war, what have you.

Id: [0x00209CF4]
If you'd tried harder, she might have gotten to see the view.

Id: [0x00209CF5]
I tell myself that every day.

Id: [0x00209CF8]
It was a tough situation. You did your best.

Id: [0x00209CFB]
You're a kind soul, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00209CFD]
But I failed her... I did.

Id: [0x00209CFF]
So what do you want me to do?

Id: [0x00209D00]
I need you to pick some of those red flowers for me from the Summit of Mount Ida so I can take them to my wife when I meet Hades.

Id: [0x00209D01]
Just a few would do. Bring them back to me here. I'll be waiting, misthios. And -

Id: [0x00209D03]
I understand.

Id: [0x00209D06]
This must be the place the old man spoke of.

Id: [0x00209D0A]
Those flowers... Are they -

Id: [0x00209D0D]
[&cry]You silly, stubborn, old man...

Id: [0x00209D0E]
I can offer you what drachmae I have left.

Id: [0x00209D10]
Thank you so much, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00209D11]
He made a promise to his wife. And I made a promise to him.

Id: [0x00209D12]
I don't have anything to offer you -

Id: [0x00209D17]
Oh. Here, it's all he had on him.

Id: [0x00209D19]
Thank you, old man.

Id: [0x00209D20]
<i>Mater</i> must be so glad you brought her flowers. You never did when she was alive...

Id: [0x00209D29]
The leader.

Id: [0x00209D2E]
Of course. Another Cultist.

Id: [0x00209D38]
By the gods - What's going on here?

Id: [0x00209D3A]
...Swordfish.

Id: [0x00209D3D]
Never find me - they can never find me. The sharks need more. Need more sharks.

Id: [0x00209D3E]
Fishermen are late - no fish for the sharks... The wives and children will have -

Id: [0x00209D40]
To -

Id: [0x00209D42]
Do!

Id: [0x00209D45]
...Isn't enough - sharks need more. I need more. More... more...

Id: [0x00209D46]
The sharks need more... Need more sharks...

Id: [0x00209D49]
Dog. Dog of Kosmos, have you come to bite?!

Id: [0x00209D50]
This rare art you mentioned sounds valuable...

Id: [0x00209D51]
Galarnos is an art dealer. I sent him to Makedonia to make a purchase on my behalf. Not knowing what he's going to bring back is half the fun.

Id: [0x00209D57]
I have nothing to do with the Cultists.

Id: [0x00209D58]
I can leave...

Id: [0x00209D5A]
I've come to tear your face off, <i>Swordfish</i>.

Id: [0x00209D5E]
Deimos has been dealt with. I saw to it personally.

Id: [0x00209D63]
Think I believe you? You're mad.

Id: [0x00209D64]
You think I haven't been preparing for this day?

Id: [0x00209D65]
A likely story!

Id: [0x00209D66]
I'm here for the -

Id: [0x00209D69]
The Minotaur happened! I was lucky -

Id: [0x00209D6C]
The Kosmos promised me everything.

Id: [0x00209D6D]
I don't care if I owe the Cult! I want out.

Id: [0x00209D72]
Once a Cultist, always a Cultist.

Id: [0x00209D74]
What do you want from me then, Deimos?!

Id: [0x00209D75]
Answers.

Id: [0x00209D77]
And you <i>will</i> give them to me.

Id: [0x00209D7F]
The Minotaur is dead.

Id: [0x00209D81]
I went into the labyrinth and killed it.

Id: [0x00209D83]
Then you have the artifact. [&ah]I can be free!

Id: [0x00209D88]
Give it to me.

Id: [0x00209D8A]
What happened in there that drove you to - <i>this</i>?

Id: [0x00209D8E]
How did you end up here?

Id: [0x00209D8F]
I'm hiding amongst the filth... and from it.

Id: [0x00209D90]
I can't show my face anymore. But Heraklion is still mine! All its fish -

Id: [0x00209D94]
You're insane.

Id: [0x00209D95]
How did you get into the labyrinth?

Id: [0x00209D97]
Nikios had a key - he put it into the stele.

Id: [0x00209D98]
But you can't go in there! It'll kill you. It'll get out and kill us all.

Id: [0x00209D99]
You underestimate me.

Id: [0x00209D9B]
That's what Nikios said.

Id: [0x00209D9D]
You're saying they're sick?

Id: [0x00209DBA]
<i>Bryce...</i>

Id: [0x00209DC5]
I'll feed you to the sharks!

Id: [0x00209DCA]
Yeah, okay, sure, why not.

Id: [0x00209DD0]
If pirates got to him, he may already be dead.

Id: [0x00209DD1]
I can't give up hope. He has a fast ship - if he saw the pirates, he'd head to the nearest shore.

Id: [0x00209DD5]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00209DDA]
<i>Mater</i> said Lagos is hiding in Fort Samikon. Time to go pay him a little visit.

Id: [0x00209DEF]
[&grunt][[grunt of pain]][/&grunt] Why you…

Id: [0x00209DFC]
That's not fair!

Id: [0x00209E07]
It hurts!

Id: [0x00209E12]
Please, please by the gods... No more!

Id: [0x00209E1A]
Too slow!

Id: [0x00209E22]
This scorpion stings!

Id: [0x00209EEF]
What are you looking for?

Id: [0x00209EF2]
Violence doesn't always solve problems.

Id: [0x00209F0C]
I hope it's worth my freedom.

Id: [0x00209F11]
Leave? Do you have any idea what I've been through to get here?

Id: [0x00209F1D]
Fucking coward! He can't get away.

Id: [0x00209F1F]
It would be a shame if any came to harm.

Id: [0x00209F25]
Oh, but I do. While in Kausos, you didn't cower in the face of the priest. A child and her family still live thanks to you.

Id: [0x00209F2A]
Oh, but I do. I saw you feign ignorance in Kausos. You let an unknown sickness govern your decision. Innocents died thanks to you.

Id: [0x00209F2E]
Oh, but I do. I see the blood of the innocents you slaughtered in that cave in Megaris. Your rush to judgement tells me all I need to know.

Id: [0x0020A1ED]
Oh, but I do. There is wisdom in your decisions. Any other <i>misthios</i> would have killed those people in that cave in Megaris, but you held back for the truth, and balanced judgement with their lives.

Id: [0x0020AAA9]
You want me to kill her cousin?

Id: [0x0020AAAA]
Exactly!

Id: [0x0020AAAE]
But how?

Id: [0x0020AAAF]
No one can hide from the light.

Id: [0x0020AAB1]
Then they'll be weaker alone.

Id: [0x0020AAB2]
I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x0020AAC1]
{I am looking to hire a <i>misthios</i>.}

Id: [0x0020BC36]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x0020BC38]
Here's your oil.

Id: [0x0020BC3B]
Ah... [&snort][sniff, sniff][/&snort]Wait. What is this stinking piss?

Id: [0x0020BC3C]
Yeah... Actually feel much better. Cleared my head right up. Time for a little drink to celebrate!

Id: [0x0020BC3D]
Sail first, drink later.

Id: [0x0020BC44]
Champion! 'Cause I'm Testikles!

Id: [0x0020BC48]
Thrilled.

Id: [0x0020BC53]
Cave of the Oracle?

Id: [0x0020BC54]
It's a local shrine. Deianeira often goes there to pray and seek guidance. Perhaps the oracle told her to kill my brother.

Id: [0x0020BC59]
Dorieus! Dorieus!

Id: [0x0020BC5A]
You're my hero!

Id: [0x0020BC5B]
Dorieus, I love you!

Id: [0x0020BC5F]
I will!

Id: [0x0020BC63]
Let's get going.

Id: [0x0020BC6A]
Onwards to Olympia... [&breath]How hard can it be to win at the Olympics?

Id: [0x0020BC73]
He was right. She lured him out to the old sparring grounds and killed him to send a message to the rest of the region.

Id: [0x0020BC75]
But you don't.

Id: [0x0020BC76]
This is a wound justice won't heal.

Id: [0x0020BC82]
Myrrine. You are as determined as ever. I'm sure you will regain your house soon.

Id: [0x0020BC92]
It was good to see you again, Myrrine. Though we had our disagreements, I do hope you regain your house soon.

Id: [0x0020BC9C]
With Lagos dead, arrangements must be made to ensure Sparta doesn't starve.

Id: [0x0020BCD3]
I'll squash you like a bug!

Id: [0x0020BCDA]
I will suck the marrow from your bones!

Id: [0x0020BCEB]
You did me a favor killing Kallias - and now I can take his place.

Id: [0x0020BCF5]
[&scream]You can take him![/&scream]

Id: [0x0020BCFC]
Come on, beautiful - you've got this!

Id: [0x0020BD3E]
The Daughters of Artemis are where Bryce said they'd be... The cave with the key must be nearby.

Id: [0x0020BD69]
I don't have long.

Id: [0x0020BD80]
We should get out of here.

Id: [0x0020BD90]
They're bad people, Ardos. You don't want to go down that road.

Id: [0x0020BD91]
O-Oh.

Id: [0x0020BD96]
You won't be seeing Swordfish for a while.

Id: [0x0020BD97]
It's true, no one has seen him for ages. He lives in the shadows - all around us.

Id: [0x0020BD99]
Whatever you say, priestess.

Id: [0x0020BD9F]
May Hermes guide him safely.

Id: [0x0020BDA0]
I'm sure he was.

Id: [0x0020BDA1]
Thank you for bringing me closure, <i>misthios</i>. Please take this.

Id: [0x0020BDA4]
He was not a lucky man, misthios. But he was honest. A good man.[&cry]

Id: [0x0020BDA5]
Your husband knew what he was getting into.

Id: [0x0020BDA6]
He was a brave and honest man doing what he could to feed us.

Id: [0x0020BDA7]
Brave - or foolish? How will you eat now?

Id: [0x0020BDA8]
Get out of my sight, you heartless <i>monster</i>.

Id: [0x0020BDAD]
My husband saw him diving off the cliffs around Fisherman's Beacon.

Id: [0x0020BDAF]
But that was a long time ago. No one's seen him in... months? Longer, maybe.

Id: [0x0020BDB1]
Thank you. I wish I could've done more for you.

Id: [0x0020BDB2]
You brought me closure. That's something. Be careful, misthios. Swordfish is a powerful man.

Id: [0x0020C4DA]
This must be the place Herodotos mentioned. [beat]Here goes nothing.

Id: [0x0020C53D]
Fine, here.

Id: [0x0020C541]
Tell Melanippos to let it really soak in.

Id: [0x0020C547]
I shouldn't have to pay after risking my life for you.

Id: [0x0020C548]
Suit yourself, but no one else in Boeotia has this herb.

Id: [0x0020C54A]
Here's the drachmae.

Id: [0x0020C54C]
On second thought, you did save Episthenes and me. Here, take the herb.

Id: [0x0020C54F]
Thank you, I appreciate the gesture.

Id: [0x0020C554]
Those bandit corpses will make excellent fertilizer for my fields.

Id: [0x0020C557]
Ready to pay now?

Id: [0x0020C55B]
<i>I'm</i> the one taking his place.

Id: [0x0020C566]
I can't pay that right now.

Id: [0x0020C568]
Suit yourself, but no one else in Boeotia has what you need.

Id: [0x0020C5A6]
Where will I find this herbalist?

Id: [0x0020C5A7]
She lives on a farm west of the city near the Tomb of Menoikeus.

Id: [0x0020C5B6]
I can't afford that.

Id: [0x0020C5B7]
Suit yourself, but no one else in Boeotia has the herb you're after.

Id: [0x0020C5C8]
Only the best horse I ever owned.

Id: [0x0020C5CA]
Be quick, please. I can only imagine what those thieves are doing to him.

Id: [0x0020C5CB]
Where did they take him?

Id: [0x0020C5D1]
You've lost a friend, but you can't lose yourself  to grief. It'll take time to heal, but Spyro would want you to move on.

Id: [0x0020C5D2]
You were kind to me before, and again now. They laugh at me for loving Spyro so much, but not you. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020C71D]
Not so good with a sword after all.

Id: [0x0020C722]
A broken man... Haunted by the Minotaur till the very end.

Id: [0x0020C729]
This must be Nikios.

Id: [0x0020C72D]
Melite is dead.

Id: [0x0020C72E]
You're very good at this Cult-slaying business, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020C730]
As High Priestess it is my duty to call out to the wayward and return them to Aphrodite's bosom.

Id: [0x0020C731]
And if you've ever been to Pephka and met its inhabitants, you'll see why divine intervention is their only salvation.

Id: [0x0020C73C]
Yes, I met some <i>colorful</i> characters over there.

Id: [0x0020C73E]
I've never been.

Id: [0x0020C743]
Lucky you.

Id: [0x0020C745]
One of my priestesses was sent there and came back... rattled.

Id: [0x0020C747]
She spoke of a man - Melite.

Id: [0x0020C756]
What about him?

Id: [0x0020C757]
The people living in Pephka are terrified of him.

Id: [0x0020C758]
He runs some shady operations, but what exactly, I can't be sure. Maybe this will be of help.

Id: [0x0020C75A]
Thank you, High Priestess.

Id: [0x0020C75B]
Now, if you'll excuse me, it is time to rebuild. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x0020C761]
He didn't die by my hand.

Id: [0x0020C764]
Now, I must take my leave - it is time to rebuild. Thank you, and farewell.

Id: [0x0020C76B]
Diona... Why did things have to come to this?

Id: [0x0020C869]
You said your husband headed -

Id: [0x0020C86A]
The biggest lynx live in caves near the ruins[2388471]. Knowing my idiot, that's where he'd go.

Id: [0x0020C86E]
Then I'll make sure he never uses it again.

Id: [0x0020C883]
...And don't swing it around! It's a delicate, ceremonial axe!

Id: [0x0020C944]
The barracks and the fort are clear. Time to find the camp.

Id: [0x0020C947]
That takes care of the barracks and the camp. Now I need to clear the fort.

Id: [0x0020C94A]
The barracks are clear. But Lagos still has guards at the camp and the fort. Both are in Smuggler's Forest.

Id: [0x0020C952]
That was the last of Lagos's guards. Killing him will be much easier now.

Id: [0x0020C955]
Now that the fort and the camp have been cleared, I should head to the barracks.

Id: [0x0020C958]
That takes care of the fort and the barracks. Time to deal with Lagos's guards at the camp.

Id: [0x0020C95B]
The camp should be nearby, I'll head there first. Then on to the barracks.

Id: [0x0020C966]
That takes care of the camp and the barracks. My last target it the fort, which is also in Smuggler's Forest.

Id: [0x0020C969]
Two strongholds down. Now I just need to find these barracks <i>mater</i> spoke of. She said they were in Tegea.

Id: [0x0020C96C]
The camp is clear. I still have to find the barracks and the fort. The fort is also in Smuggler's Forest - I should start there.

Id: [0x0020C977]
Time to find Lagos. Now when he screams for reinforcements, no one will come.

Id: [0x0020C9B0]
Leonidas... [beat]Why?

Id: [0x0020C9B1]
There's something I need to know. Something that may help us take down this Cult, and save your mother.

Id: [0x0020C9CA]
With all his reinforcements in the underworld, Lagos will be an easy target.

Id: [0x0020C9D3]
These tracks don't look human. They lead away from the camp to the north.

Id: [0x0020C9D8]
This fire's fresh, and the food still simmering. Nesaia can't be far away.

Id: [0x0020C9DD]
This hut must be Nesaia's. I guess she prefers the quiet of the forest over living in the city.

Id: [0x0020D073]
Ah. These must be the barracks <i>mater</i> spoke of.

Id: [0x0020D0DA]
Their final war cries, before every last one of those brave Spartans perished. Their voices were silenced that day, but their story will be sung for an eternity.

Id: [0x0020D10E]
Herodotos!

Id: [0x0020D132]
I found <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x0020D134]
Finally reunited, only to lose each other again.

Id: [0x0020D138]
If we continue, one of us will die.

Id: [0x0020D139]
Isn't that the point?

Id: [0x0020D13A]
You knew this would happen.

Id: [0x0020D13B]
I didn't know - but I did suspect. There is a place I'd convinced myself was a dream... until now.

Id: [0x0020D13C]
A peculiar structure on the island of Andros - mysterious shapes carved in stone. Like nothing I've ever seen.

Id: [0x0020D13D]
You want to sail to Andros so you can show me shapes?

Id: [0x0020D13E]
In my travels I heard whispers of an ancient civilization, a people who came... before.

Id: [0x0020D141]
Your spear and that place are connected.

Id: [0x0020D145]
Well? We going?

Id: [0x0020D14A]
I'll meet you at my ship.

Id: [0x0020D14E]
Who is that?

Id: [0x0020D14F]
That is Dorieus, the reigning champion. He's bloodthirsty, competitive, and has endurance to spare. Jealous?

Id: [0x0020D152]
It's better this way.

Id: [0x0020D156]
Hold still.

Id: [0x0020D16E]
I'll take this shield to the Statue of Athena in Athens.

Id: [0x0020D173]
If you are out there, Athena, please watch over Roxana of Hydrea. She... fought honorably.

Id: [0x0020D179]
I'd want something more valuable.

Id: [0x0020D17B]
Take that <i>back.</i>

Id: [0x0020D180]
This is junk.

Id: [0x0020D181]
Maybe to you -

Id: [0x0020D1D3]
I WON'T GO BACK. I won't go back in there.

Id: [0x0020D1D4]
Go fetch it.

Id: [0x0020D1D5]
You want that artifact -

Id: [0x0020D1D7]
GIVE IT TO ME.

Id: [0x0020D1D8]
GIVE IT TO ME.

Id: [0x0020D1DA]
Nikios, though...

Id: [0x0020D1DC]
Not this!

Id: [0x0020D1E0]
And all its people.

Id: [0x0020D1EF]
Dead?

Id: [0x0020D1F1]
Still... Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020D1F2]
If he's real, killing a creature of legend would be worth my time.

Id: [0x0020D1F4]
No, <i>misthios</i>. It's very much alive and well.

Id: [0x0020D1F8]
Those idiots in Pephka - they wouldn't know a <i>real </i>Minotaur if it ran them through with its horns!

Id: [0x0020D1F9]
It's not like that here, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0020D208]
...I'm sorry I stole the disk -

Id: [0x0020D209]
I understand -

Id: [0x0020D20A]
And your amulet.

Id: [0x0020D20B]
What amulet?

Id: [0x0020D20D]
By the gods - you can't be stealing things all the time, Ardos!

Id: [0x0020D20E]
But I'm <i>good </i>at it! And I only steal from people who deserve it.

Id: [0x0020D20F]
...You didn't steal anything from the <i>misthios</i>, did you?

Id: [0x0020D210]
Ha! We'll never know.

Id: [0x0020D214]
And your ring collection.

Id: [0x0020D215]
So that's where -

Id: [0x0020D216]
And your memoirs.

Id: [0x0020D217]
I hadn't finished those!

Id: [0x0020D21C]
I didn't deserve it.

Id: [0x0020D21D]
You didn't talk to me for years.

Id: [0x0020D21E]
Well, I -

Id: [0x0020D21F]
You're right. I wasn't there for you. Perhaps I did deserve it.

Id: [0x0020D220]
I know, right?! Not to mention all the gold -

Id: [0x0020D221]
WHAT?! Ardos -

Id: [0x0020D25C]
Kassandra of Sparta.

Id: [0x0020D278]
Brasidas will be in the thick of it... Deimos, too.

Id: [0x0020D297]
I can move quietly when I need to. What do you want?

Id: [0x0020D298]
There's a bear in the area. It's wild, attacking people and animals both. I've tried tracking it, but it runs the minute I get close. You might have more luck.

Id: [0x0020D29B]
That doesn't sound like a problem.

Id: [0x0020D29C]
It wouldn't be, if I could deliver enough pelts! But he's already sold more than I can catch - and he's blaming me for it. I need an extra pair of hands.

Id: [0x0020D2AF]
There's a lion in the area. It's gotten a taste for human blood and started carrying off children.

Id: [0x0020D2B1]
That sounds serious. And what is it?

Id: [0x0020D2B6]
The Cult gave me this. They said it was a sign of my devotion. Maybe you can use it against them.

Id: [0x0020D2B7]
I'm sure I can find a way.

Id: [0x0020D2BD]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x0020D2BF]
The Pythia is done for the day.

Id: [0x0020D2C0]
I'm not leaving until I get answers.

Id: [0x0020D2C1]
Depends on why you're asking.

Id: [0x0020D2C2]
The council banned hunting in my forest. I need to hunt to earn a living! I've carved a message for them on this wax tablet. But I'm nobody - they won't listen to me. They'd listen to someone like you, though.

Id: [0x0020D2C7]
Yes, I know.

Id: [0x0020D2C8]
And then there's the foot races and the horse races. Sweat <i>everywhere</i>. A delight for the eyes <i>and </i>the nose.

Id: [0x0020D2CD]
And show <i>me </i>while you're at it.

Id: [0x0020D2D2]
It is. Why do you ask?

Id: [0x0020D2D3]
I'm supposed to take some rich men hare-hunting. But there's a feral wolf - it's not safe. If they get injured, the only one who pays is me.

Id: [0x0020D2DC]
Soldiers don't stand a chance against me.

Id: [0x0020D2E0]
That's probably a wise answer. But if you <i>were</i> the one that did it... I might have some work for you.

Id: [0x0020D2E5]
That's what I like to hear. They've been hunting this area to fill their cookpots. Local folk can't catch a hare to save their lives - we're starving. I want those soldiers gone.

Id: [0x0020D2E6]
Tell me what you need.

Id: [0x0020D2E7]
Those soldiers have been hunting every animal in the area to fill their cookpots. No one here can catch enough to eat. We need those soldiers gone.

Id: [0x0020D2E8]
A good mercenary never discusses their work.

Id: [0x0020D2EF]
I don't have anyplace else to go. Besides, they're the ones causing trouble - not me.

Id: [0x0020D2F3]
That's what I think, too.

Id: [0x0020D2FA]
If they're the ones who put you in that cage, I'd say it's better if you leave.

Id: [0x0020D2FB]
They need to be taught a lesson.

Id: [0x0020D315]
If you're waiting for the result, you shouldn't have to wait much longer.

Id: [0x0020D319]
If you can't write, someone will write the name on the ostraka for you.

Id: [0x0020D31D]
Patience, patience. We will have the results shortly.

Id: [0x0020D321]
My fate will be decided soon.

Id: [0x0020D337]
Who among you is afraid?!

Id: [0x0020D34B]
Something strange is going on here... I'd rather stay out of it.

Id: [0x0020D363]
Ah, a mighty specimen approaches! Are you ready for honor? For glory?! <i>For certain death?!</i>

Id: [0x0020D364]
I'm ready for two-thirds of that.

Id: [0x0020D377]
The Minotaur's already dead, by my hand.

Id: [0x0020D379]
You killed the Minotaur?![&laughs]

Id: [0x0020D37B]
[&laughs]I'm sorry friend, you're very mistaken! Some scam artist fooled you with flame-lit corridors and flimsy costumes! The 100% genuine and completely real Minotaur lives here!

Id: [0x0020D37F]
Disappointing, but perhaps Pephka is only for our <i>bravest</i> warriors.

Id: [0x0020D389]
Maybe another time.

Id: [0x0020D38A]
A shame. The Minotaur won't slay himself, you know.

Id: [0x0020D38E]
Who among you is frail or weak?!

Id: [0x0020D390]
Who among you... <i>IS STRONG?!</i>

Id: [0x0020D392]
Then I say prove yourselves! Come face-to-face with He of the Blood-Soaked Hooves! He of the Entrail-Splattered Horns! You know his name, you know his roar! The Beast, the Myth... <i>THE MINOTAAAAAUR!!!</i>

Id: [0x0020D394]
Maximum of three members per Minotaur hunting party; purchase of Minotaur-themed merchandise <i>is</i> mandatory before proceeding; no legendary warriors, pregnant heroes, or legitimate gods (demi, semi, or otherwise) are eligible to fight the Minotaur; and no pushing - you'll all get a chance at dismemberment.

Id: [0x0020D3C7]
hello

Id: [0x0020D40C]
Please, get me back to my wife in Skandeia Harbor!

Id: [0x0020D40E]
Your Minotaur must die.

Id: [0x0020D53B]
Perhaps you've summoned enough courage to face Pephka's merciless Minotaur?

Id: [0x0020D540]
The Minotaur's a celebrity, <i>misthios</i> - he won't fight you if you haven't even <i>begun </i>the Trials!

Id: [0x0020D548]
Sounds like we have... <i>another contender!</i>

Id: [0x0020D54A]
It's time for the Trials of the Minotaur.. Pre-Trials.

Id: [0x0020D593]
I need models for my statues!

Id: [0x0020D5A9]
The Creature's lair. Where is it exactly?

Id: [0x0020D5AA]
Deep within the valley... Though once you're there, you lose all sense of direction.

Id: [0x0020D5F5]
It's strange... but I would like something to remember Pephka by.

Id: [0x0020D5F6]
Not. Another. Drachma.

Id: [0x0020D5F7]
I - sorry. Sorry sorry sorry.

Id: [0x0020D5F9]
Then all that's left is facing our star attraction himself - THE MINOTAUR! Are you ready to meet your doom?

Id: [0x0020D5FA]
The Minotaur's waited for thousands of years, he can wait a little longer.

Id: [0x0020D5FB]
If your "Pre-Trials" are anything to go by, yes. Yes I am.

Id: [0x0020D865]
Time to talk.

Id: [0x0020D87D]
Something's glowing over there.

Id: [0x0020D88D]
Yes.

Id: [0x0020D88E]
But we both survived. Against their wishes.

Id: [0x0020D8EF]
What do you mean, "after me?"

Id: [0x0020E132]
[exhale]<i>Maláka</i>.

Id: [0x0020E133]
Herodotos won't believe this. I have to tell him what happened.

Id: [0x0020E136]
Well, was the legend true? Was it magnificent? What happened to you? And your spear?

Id: [0x0020E138]
So the ancient civilization is real. Kassandra, you have no idea the power you possess - all harnessed in Leonidas's spear.

Id: [0x0020E13C]
Stand aside. This is important.

Id: [0x0020E13D]
So is keeping people out. Maybe you can see Phidias after his trial... If the people spare his life.

Id: [0x0020E13F]
It isn't often you see a guard outside of an artist's workshop.

Id: [0x0020E140]
I just do what I'm told, stranger. And until I'm told otherwise, no one is going in or out.

Id: [0x0020E2F4]
That'll do just fine. You tell anyone I did this and you're as good as dead.

Id: [0x0020E2F9]
Not now, you fool! Phoibe's been taken.

Id: [0x0020E2FA]
By who?

Id: [0x0020E2FB]
Thugs of the Cyclops - who else? Snatched her right off the main road!

Id: [0x0020E326]
The "<i>leader," </i>- a burly man with a huge axe wears it now. Take his head, and the amulet is yours to keep!

Id: [0x0020E32A]
We need to leave now. I'll escort you back to Heraklion.

Id: [0x0020E32B]
I'm right behind you.

Id: [0x0020E32C]
It's not enough?

Id: [0x0020E32D]
It's not enough.

Id: [0x0020E333]
Please, <i>misthios</i>! I need that axe. Help me retrieve it, and I will reward you handsomely.

Id: [0x0020E338]
A survivor.

Id: [0x0020E341]
I should ask Ardos if the old man is telling the truth.

Id: [0x0020E351]
Go away!

Id: [0x0020E356]
Get out of here!

Id: [0x0020E359]
You're going to get <i>both</i> of us in trouble! Leave.

Id: [0x0020E35D]
These fishermen should know something about Swordfish.

Id: [0x0020E361]
This must be Ardos's House.

Id: [0x0020E367]
<i>Misthios,</i> help! The Cult is after the boy. I have to save him.

Id: [0x0020E368]
The boy? Ardos?

Id: [0x0020E369]
Yes. How do you -

Id: [0x0020E36A]
I'm a friend. Hurry up, let's get you out of here.

Id: [0x0020E370]
Then let the crushing begin!

Id: [0x0020E372]
A ring? Ardos might want this.

Id: [0x0020E379]
By the gods...

Id: [0x0020E37C]
I look forward to more of your cowardice, tiny one!

Id: [0x0020E37E]
The Token of Strength is yours. Have a wonderful day - and please don't hit me again.

Id: [0x0020E37F]
...Winning is better, yes.

Id: [0x00210259]
So you want me to check out the area?

Id: [0x00210547]
I can't believe he's gone.

Id: [0x00210548]
Unprecedented!

Id: [0x0021054B]
The event doesn't start just yet. We could look around first - Olympia at truce is quite extraordinary.

Id: [0x00210553]
That's not everything. Deimos followed me here. The Cult's already moving - he told me himself. They're going after us - my family, Perikles...

Id: [0x00210554]
Why would he tell you, unless it was a trap?

Id: [0x00210555]
It doesn't matter. We have to get to Athens - to warn Perikles. And we need to find my mother before they do.

Id: [0x00210559]
<i>Mater</i>... I haven't forgotten you.

Id: [0x0021055C]
"So I, the Muses' nectar shedding;<LF>To conquerors deal the draught divine;<LF>Whose brow, with garlands amply spreading;<LF>Pytho and Olympia twine.<LF>Blest the sound of virtuous fame -"

Id: [0x00210569]
I know Brasidas means well, but Lagos wants us dead.

Id: [0x0021056E]
I heard you cut through Lagos's best men. Your path to the Archon is clear.

Id: [0x00210573]
The smoke from Lagos's grain silos could be seen across Arkadia. I’m proud of you.

Id: [0x00210578]
Thank you for freeing us, <i>misthios</i>. I wasn't sure we'd make it another day.

Id: [0x0021057D]
Thank you for sparing my life. I'll use what's left of it to fight the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x00210587]
I only hope your actions in Arkadia will help bring an end to this war.

Id: [0x0021058C]
Your time in Arkadia has certainly been eventful, lamb.

Id: [0x00210596]
I'll bring glory to my brother's name. I'll become a Boeotian champion.

Id: [0x0021059B]
If this potion is half as potent as it smells, Drakon won't stand a chance.

Id: [0x002105A4]
You've made me and Spyro the happiest boys in the world, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002105A7]
All that's left to do is plan Spyro's burial, I suppose.

Id: [0x002105AB]
I can't believe Testikles is gone...

Id: [0x002105B0]
Ah, I love Olympia during the sacred truce. Everyone's so... <i>loose</i>.

Id: [0x002105B5]
Testikles is with the ferryman now... Good riddance.

Id: [0x002105BA]
I heard you found Testikles. I bet he crushed 'em in Olympia.

Id: [0x002105D4]
You did good. Thought of a career in sports?

Id: [0x002105E7]
But first! <i>Everything</i> has a price.

Id: [0x002105E8]
This tablet will lead you <i>directly</i> to untold riches.

Id: [0x002105EA]
...<i>And</i> untold fortunes!

Id: [0x002105EC]
What the?

Id: [0x002105F2]
I take it you have enough drachmae this time?

Id: [0x002105FB]
The shipwreck! The cone snails must be close by.

Id: [0x00210602]
This... can't be Minoan.

Id: [0x00210607]
There must be an easier way down.

Id: [0x0021060C]
A creature of rage did this.

Id: [0x00210611]
The string Theseus used to navigate the labyrinth... Let's see what's at the end.

Id: [0x00210616]
<i>Maláka</i>. It's real.

Id: [0x0021061B]
I've been this way before.

Id: [0x00210624]
A tragic tale... But last I heard, the Minotaur was living in Pephka. He's quite famous.

Id: [0x00210625]
They don't know what they're talking about! The real Minotaur is in Messara!

Id: [0x00210626]
That's what they said in Pephka.

Id: [0x00210627]
It's a scam.

Id: [0x0021062E]
There's blood in the water!

Id: [0x00210633]
The fisherman's son. Looks like he got tangled up in the net trying to haul a heavy load of fish. Slipped, then the weight of the net dragged him down.

Id: [0x0021063D]
Those birds are circling over something. The fisherman's boat must be close by.

Id: [0x00210642]
You there! My name's Galarnos. I'll pay you to get me out of here.

Id: [0x00210647]
Looks like the Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x0021064C]
Some of the wood and parts have been looted.

Id: [0x00210651]
Who loots a ship for materials, and not the dead for drachmae?

Id: [0x00210658]
Just a little farther and we'll be there!<LF>

Id: [0x0021065C]
That's all 3 Tokens. Better meet Leiandros at the Warrior's Rest.

Id: [0x00210660]
I still haven't got all the Trial Tokens.

Id: [0x00210675]
Slow down, Herodotos. [beat]My spear's stronger now. I can feel it.

Id: [0x00210739]
This was definitely poison, and Alkibiades wasn't the only victim.

Id: [0x0021073F]
[&breath][sigh][/&breath]The truce is fragile enough...

Id: [0x00210744]
It's down this way!

Id: [0x00210745]
This place is going to blow your mind, misthios. There's a <i>hugeeeeee</i> room and there's a <i>hugeeeeee</i> hole in the ground with a <i>hugeeeeee</i> door.

Id: [0x00210746]
Everybody keeps going on about how -

Id: [0x00210747]
<i>Theseus </i>killed the Minotaur.

Id: [0x00210748]
Lies! I heard it! A roar, like - like uh -

Id: [0x00210749]
Rolling thunder!

Id: [0x0021074B]
Yeah, that's it.

Id: [0x0021074C]
The Minotaur is still alive! And hungry!

Id: [0x0021074D]
I'm glad you came along. Now pater has a shot of getting out of that damn labyrinth.

Id: [0x0021074E]
They really didn't have to put the entrance this deep. Almost there. What were these Minoans thinking?

Id: [0x00210754]
What are you doing? Come back, misthios!

Id: [0x00210759]
Here we are!

Id: [0x00210762]
This proves it, poison! It must have been added to the food and wine.

Id: [0x00210767]
This food smells strange, but it's not rotten.

Id: [0x00210769]
Great.

Id: [0x0021076D]
Hmm, a supply list for the celebration... and the merchant's name.

Id: [0x00210770]
Time to pay this Priam a visit.

Id: [0x00210788]
Now we're going to have a conversation.

Id: [0x00210789]
Please, please, I was just doing what I was told.

Id: [0x00210793]
Now you'll do what<i> I</i> tell you.

Id: [0x00210794]
Please, I thought we were just trying to make them slow - you know, so they lose. Win a few drachmae...

Id: [0x00210795]
Your actions could cost Alkibiades his life. Now you will pay with yours.

Id: [0x002107A1]
Another victim of the Cult.

Id: [0x002107AB]
A note... "Once you've delivered the food, visit me at Fort Koroibos for your final payment. Kallias"

Id: [0x002107B1]
If this Kallias thinks hiding in a fort will stop me...

Id: [0x002107B3]
My friend Alkibiades may already be dead, and you're talking about drachmae.

Id: [0x002107B4]
The golden boy? I was there. He didn't have much - if you can get him the antidote, he'll survive.

Id: [0x002107B5]
Tell me where it is.

Id: [0x002107B6]
They're sure to have it at Fort Koroibos. A man there paid me to do this. Look there.

Id: [0x002107B7]
I'm not after you, just whoever wanted this done.

Id: [0x002107B8]
I don't know, I never saw him. I just thought he wanted to fix a race, but then I saw what started happening and I knew they'd been poisoned.

Id: [0x002107BB]
My friend Alkibiades - I need to save him.

Id: [0x002107BC]
You'll likely find the antidote up at Fort Koroibos.

Id: [0x002107C5]
Whoever did this will pay, but I'll take care of you first.

Id: [0x002107C7]
Whoever did this will pay. Go, and don't let me see your face again.

Id: [0x002107C8]
Yes, thank you...

Id: [0x002107CE]
This must be the antidote.

Id: [0x002107DC]
[&ah]Ugh, [/&ah]more wine please, to wash away the taste.

Id: [0x002107F8]
Here, I have the antidote.

Id: [0x0021082E]
I can already feel my <i>stamina</i> returning...

Id: [0x00210831]
[&ahem]Didn't you have one last fight in the pankration?

Id: [0x00210832]
Let's go.

Id: [0x00210836]
You saved me the job of finding you. The Cult will be pleased.

Id: [0x0021083B]
I need to get back to Alkibiades as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00210841]
You've proven I can trust you, but let's make it quick, Herodotos. First Thermopylai, then we go to Athens.

Id: [0x00210863]
Listen. I'm working for Perikles. He wants me to see Phidias.

Id: [0x00210866]
Well <i>I'm</i> working for the people of Athens, and <i>they</i> want Phidias dead. Now back off, or you're dead too.

Id: [0x0021086B]
Phidias and I have been friends for a long time. I'm leaving Athens, and I don't know if I'll ever see him again.

Id: [0x0021086E]
You won't. If you want to leave Athens in one piece, you'll go. Now.

Id: [0x00210870]
It's been so long since Phidias and I have... <i>seen </i>each other. You understand, don't you?

Id: [0x00210871]
Oh! Oh... Come to pay him a last visit before the trial? He's as good as dead, you know. Better make this one count.

Id: [0x0021088A]
Yes, of course.

Id: [0x002108A1]
You were... celebrating?

Id: [0x002108A2]
It's the Olympics. What's not to celebrate? We were at the Leonidaion.

Id: [0x002108A5]
If you've been poisoned, I need to find these judges.

Id: [0x002108A8]
Poisoned? Do you think that they could be too or... No. Never! They're good men you can't think one of them... They host a celebration every Olympics to celebrate the sacred truce.

Id: [0x002108AC]
Stay with him. I'll find out what happened.

Id: [0x002108B6]
Too much cheap wine?

Id: [0x002108C3]
So you do know. I tried talking to Perikles, but we were interrupted.

Id: [0x002108CB]
You look like you drank from Medea's cup...

Id: [0x002108CC]
Medea's cup? You think he's been poisoned?

Id: [0x002108CF]
Alkibiades, are you all right?

Id: [0x002108D1]
Tell me where they went.

Id: [0x002108D2]
In the direction of Ktimene Beach.

Id: [0x002108DF]
Don't worry, I'll stay with Alkibiades.

Id: [0x002108E4]
[&ah]Ugh…[/&ah]

Id: [0x0021093C]
[&shush]I can't wait to see you all oiled up at the pankration.

Id: [0x0021093E]
Time to fight, isn't it?

Id: [0x00210943]
A treatment worthy of Hippokrates!

Id: [0x0021094A]
I'll get you the bear skins from Chios island.

Id: [0x0021094B]
Wonderful! The best ones are found north of Chios city. And misthios, one more thing - when you find the bears, pet one for me.

Id: [0x0021094E]
Do hurry. I've got paying customers waiting for breastplates made from those skins.

Id: [0x00210958]
I. Am... The Minotaur! [&scream]<i>Roooooooar!!!</i>[/&scream]

Id: [0x0021095A]
...What?

Id: [0x0021095B]
Drop all your valuables and flee in terror, mortal!

Id: [0x0021095D]
L-leave me your drachmae and you shall be spared! otherwise, DEATH BY HOOF AWAITS YOU!

Id: [0x0021095E]
<i>FEAR MY MOO!!!</i> ...Fear it?

Id: [0x00210960]
<i>Maláka</i>... I'm going to start stabbing until someone tells me what's going on!

Id: [0x00210964]
These bandits. How many are there exactly?

Id: [0x00210965]
It all happened fast. But I'd say there were ten.

Id: [0x00210967]
...Though if Sokrates were a more willing partner...

Id: [0x0021096B]
By Iris! It's Chios island.

Id: [0x00210976]
The bears are in the forests north of Chios city.

Id: [0x0021097B]
The merchant was right! It's the softest fur I've ever felt.

Id: [0x00210980]
I'll see if the merchant can make me an entire outfit out of these soft skins.

Id: [0x00210985]
That's all of the skins. It's time to sail back to Mytilene and collect my breastplate.

Id: [0x00210C40]
Then you seek combat with... THE MINOTAUR!

Id: [0x00210C42]
If you slay the Minotaur, you would be Theseus reborn!

Id: [0x00210C49]
And you'd get to take home the <i>Prize of Pephka!</i>

Id: [0x00210C66]
This must be the logging camp. Where could the cages be?

Id: [0x00210C6B]
Easy, four-legs. I'm a friend of Zoe's...

Id: [0x00210C72]
Nice four-legs. Don't bite - I'm here to free you.

Id: [0x00210C77]
Zoe will want to know that all the wolves are free.

Id: [0x00210C79]
Are you sure you would not prefer to spend your shiny drachmae -

Id: [0x00210C7A]
<i>We fight.</i>

Id: [0x00210CB9]
These wolves will want blood once released. I should be careful.

Id: [0x00210CBD]
How many men have you sent to their deaths with a speech and a smile?

Id: [0x00210CBE]
Thousands. More. But their lives will <i>never</i> outweigh my Amara.

Id: [0x00210CCC]
Your wife sent me to save you two.

Id: [0x00210CCE]
Not my wife - my friend's wife. You know, she was always worried something bad would happen...

Id: [0x00210CCF]
You're safe now. Can you make it home?

Id: [0x00210CD3]
Don't kill me, don't kill me, don't kill me!

Id: [0x00210CD5]
They made me do it! Their masks are even scarier than mine!

Id: [0x00210CD7]
It's worth it... it's worth it... I-I'm not a bad man...

Id: [0x00210CDA]
Can I hire you to find my husband and kill the giant wolf for me?

Id: [0x00210CDB]
Why would I need to kill the wolf? I can just bring back your husband and his friend.

Id: [0x00210CDC]
If you don't, those two idiots will continue their hunt. I need this nightmare to stop, and I'll give you my husband's helmet as payment.

Id: [0x00210CEA]
But I killed the wolf and brought you its pelt. You can take comfort knowing he was avenged.

Id: [0x00210CEB]
Comfort? Avenged? My husband is dead. Nothing will ever change that fact! Take his helmet and leave!

Id: [0x00210CF1]
Found one... killed by the wolf. I wonder if this is the husband?

Id: [0x00210CFE]
No one's ever won the Prize of Pephka! Everyone who's died facing the "Minotaur" has had their drachmae go in the vault, growing year by year. And now... a <i>tiny</i>, but well earned, portion of it is yours!

Id: [0x00210CFF]
Of course! Less taxes, reasonable operational expenses and-

Id: [0x00210D01]
I'll make sure <i>all</i> of it reaches your boat, <i>misthios</i>! You've earned it! Haha!

Id: [0x00210D04]
Be safe.

Id: [0x00210D71]
The Cult of Kosmos... You know about them.

Id: [0x00210D73]
Then Perikles isn't just getting you out of Athens to save you from the trial... He's saving you from being murdered.

Id: [0x00210D79]
A guard!

Id: [0x00210D7B]
I understand.

Id: [0x00210D7D]
You didn't think you could attack one of us and get away with it, did you? Come out and fight!

Id: [0x00210D7F]
You didn't really think I'd let you come and go as you pleased, did you? Now, where are you?

Id: [0x00210D83]
I told you I'd get you out of Athens.

Id: [0x00210D84]
So you did.

Id: [0x00210D87]
Can your friend be trusted?

Id: [0x00210D88]
Theras and I have been friends for a long time. I just sent word telling him where to meet us.

Id: [0x00210D8B]
Wasting time will only get us into trouble. Let's head to Seriphos while we still can.

Id: [0x00210DA3]
I want the Archon dead.

Id: [0x00210DA4]
None of this makes sense. This isn't the Lagos I know.

Id: [0x00210DB0]
You notice Lagos acting strange before he left?

Id: [0x00210DB1]
He's been on edge ever since our... problem at the outpost.

Id: [0x00210DC5]
I'm sick of this job. It's boring as dirt.

Id: [0x00210DC6]
Could be worse, could be us guarding the hideout next to the farmhouse.

Id: [0x00210DC7]
Hopefully that slack-jawed messenger will be here soon.

Id: [0x00210DC8]
What's so important about a letter that they'd need us?

Id: [0x00210DC9]
<i>Maláka</i>! Anyone could follow the messenger straight to the family.

Id: [0x00210E05]
We'll go to the safe house.

Id: [0x00210E06]
I hope we see <i>pater</i> soon.

Id: [0x00210E0D]
You've proven your point, now finish this. I welcome death if it means I don't have to see you again.

Id: [0x00210E1E]
You silly, lovestruck fool, Melanippos. Thinking he loved you as you are.

Id: [0x00210E25]
Don't. Don't.

Id: [0x00210E26]
Then get her out of the house. You die if she doesn't.

Id: [0x00210E27]
The farm's <i>ours.</i>

Id: [0x00210E2D]
I cannot wait to feel my Drakon's crushing embrace again.

Id: [0x00210E33]
Gods be with you for saving me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00210E42]
What I would do to see you again, Spyro... If only.

Id: [0x00210E66]
I never thought I'd actually get to see the Olympics - with a champion no less!

Id: [0x00210E67]
Can't see the appeal.

Id: [0x00210E68]
Everyone coming together peacefully in friendly competition, rather than on a battlefield.

Id: [0x00210E69]
You'd think they'd just kill each other like everywhere else.

Id: [0x00210E6A]
That's the magic of the Olympics.

Id: [0x00210E73]
Testikles, it's an honor to sail with you. Your victory at the Pythian games is legendary.

Id: [0x00210E74]
Yes... I am!

Id: [0x00210E75]
What made you kick him in the head instead of going for a grapple?

Id: [0x00210E76]
Felt like it.

Id: [0x00210E77]
[&ah]Ah, [/&ah]improvisation! Keep your opponent off guard - a good strategy.

Id: [0x00210E78]
Strategy's for people who don't hit hard enough.

Id: [0x00210E81]
Nike! I'm gonna win!

Id: [0x00210E82]
Are you excited for the Games, Kassandra?

Id: [0x00210E83]
Thrilled.

Id: [0x00210E84]
Sparta! Woo!

Id: [0x00210E85]
Stand warrior stand - feet firmly planted, even in sand. Our spirits soar on high, for a Spartan never truly dies.

Id: [0x00210E86]
Huh?

Id: [0x00210E87]
It's a poem. A Spartan poem...

Id: [0x00210E88]
Oh. [beat]SPARTA! Woo!

Id: [0x00210E8F]
Dorieus! Dorieus!

Id: [0x00210E90]
You're my hero!

Id: [0x00210E91]
[&scream]Dorieus, I love you![/&scream]

Id: [0x00210EA1]
You saved me the job of finding you. The Cult will be pleased.

Id: [0x00210EBA]
For all their bravery, the Spartans have allowed themselves to get trapped on Sphakteria.

Id: [0x00210EBB]
Trapped?

Id: [0x00210EBC]
The Athenians have surrounded the island.

Id: [0x00210EBD]
Brasidas will be in the thick of it... Deimos, too.

Id: [0x00210EC3]
By the gods, it's as if we're sailing into the mouth of Hades!

Id: [0x00210EC5]
Go on...

Id: [0x00210ED4]
This is the right area. The cave with the mushrooms should be close.

Id: [0x00210ED9]
The mountain. The hellebore should be here somewhere.

Id: [0x00210EE8]
There's a predator hunting in the area.

Id: [0x00210EED]
What is this...?

Id: [0x00210EF3]
Why'd they have to take all my clothes?!

Id: [0x00210EF4]
You're just like them. Thinking I'm not tough enough.

Id: [0x00210EF5]
Taking a life isn't easy, and it can't be undone. You aren't a killer.

Id: [0x00210EF8]
<i>Malákes</i> wolves!

Id: [0x00210EFA]
Quick, <i>misthios</i>! Untie me!

Id: [0x00210EFB]
You don't know me. I can do it!

Id: [0x00210EFF]
I can see good in you. You're passionate, determined - why not help others?

Id: [0x00210F11]
She's all I have... but now I have you, don't I? You... you can free her from those malákes masked men!

Id: [0x00210F17]
You mean this amulet?

Id: [0x00210F18]
Why, yes!

Id: [0x00210F19]
Are there any <i>other</i> valuables?

Id: [0x00210F1A]
Uh...

Id: [0x00210F24]
The farm is south of Chios, in the Forest of Tears.

Id: [0x00210F2C]
No bandit can be left alive, or the family will never be safe.

Id: [0x00210F33]
Looks like the amulet will have to do.

Id: [0x00210F34]
Go, <i>maláka</i>! Or I'll take care of you like I did the wolves.

Id: [0x00210F36]
It's not called freedom because it's free. I'd say you owe me for my services.

Id: [0x00210F39]
How... how about I work for you? I know how to fight! The Followers of Ares gave me that much, at least.

Id: [0x00210F3B]
What do you say?

Id: [0x00210F42]
OK, you work for me now. I don't see much value in you... but it's better than nothing.

Id: [0x00210F43]
I'll see you back at your ship then, Commander.

Id: [0x00210F44]
Not before putting on some clothes!

Id: [0x00210F46]
Go on.

Id: [0x00210F48]
I have no need for the likes of you.

Id: [0x00210F49]
Y-yes! Right away.

Id: [0x00210F4B]
You deserted the Followers of Ares and expect to live? What's your plan?

Id: [0x00210F4C]
I assumed I'd become carrion. But wait! Maybe...

Id: [0x00210F4D]
I don't like the sound of this.

Id: [0x00210FD3]
Someone's being hurt.

Id: [0x0021101C]
Allie! We're out of oil again!

Id: [0x0021101D]
Allie?

Id: [0x0021101F]
You know they like you when they give you a pet name. There's more olive oil in the kitchen... but Aspasia keeps complaining about me walking unencumbered through her symposiums.

Id: [0x00211020]
You mean naked.

Id: [0x00211027]
<i>Chaire,</i> friend. I saw you talking to my associate, Perikles.

Id: [0x00211028]
From what I saw, you weren't doing much associating.

Id: [0x00211029]
That's just politics. Perikles is a good man - a fine man - just not the right man.

Id: [0x0021102A]
That's not what I heard.

Id: [0x0021102B]
From whose lips? His?

Id: [0x00211032]
I've heard you both speak - you treat people's lives like it's some sort of game.

Id: [0x00211033]
Politics <i>is</i> a game, and one with high stakes.

Id: [0x00211034]
I play for the people, while Perikles plays for power.

Id: [0x0021103A]
We all play for power. It's what we do with it that matters.

Id: [0x0021103B]
True, but understand we have a dangerous, weak, leader. The times demand strength.

Id: [0x0021103F]
Politics should be about the people. Isn't that the heart of Athenian democracy?

Id: [0x00211040]
I'm not saying Perikles doesn't care for the people... Just that he doesn't lead them with a firm enough hand.

Id: [0x00211043]
He was elected - Athens is the seat of democracy.

Id: [0x00211045]
Oh, it is. It's just that the wrong man is sitting in that seat.

Id: [0x00211048]
Did you actually need something, or did you just want to educate me on the finer points of democracy?

Id: [0x00211049]
Perikles is holding parties for the rich and powerful while we are under siege. What I want is for my people to reclaim control. You could help me.

Id: [0x0021105B]
My services don't come cheap.

Id: [0x0021105C]
I understand the wheels of commerce and the needs of the people. I will pay you handsomely for your services.

Id: [0x00211060]
Think about it. Will you take my commission and show the Spartans we are not defeated yet?

Id: [0x00211064]
I have no problem killing Spartans.

Id: [0x00211065]
Trust me. This is a huge opportunity for you.

Id: [0x00211068]
I have enough to do in Athens, but I'll consider your offer.

Id: [0x00211069]
Don't think too long on it.

Id: [0x0021106B]
What did you need me to do again?

Id: [0x0021106C]
Show the Spartans who's in charge and help raise morale.

Id: [0x0021106D]
Kill a Spartan commander, destroy their supplies, and bring me proof of your deeds... Are you up to the task?

Id: [0x00211072]
It sounds so good when you say it.

Id: [0x00211073]
I think I'll check all the same.

Id: [0x00211147]
What's going on?

Id: [0x0021114E]
Help me! Please, someone.

Id: [0x00211152]
By the gods, why did it have to be snakes?

Id: [0x00211156]
Snakes... like the ones that were meant to kill Metiochos.

Id: [0x0021115A]
It looks like the thugs who attacked Metiochos weren't the masterminds behind this plot.

Id: [0x0021115E]
Hmm, snake bites, and someone hid the body. Though I have a feeling this death was an accident.

Id: [0x00211162]
You'll feel the sting of my venom.

Id: [0x00211166]
I'll end you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021116A]
You can't stop me.

Id: [0x0021116E]
The corrupt will be snuffed out one way or another.

Id: [0x002121D1]
If you say so.

Id: [0x002121D2]
Yes. I'll be fine.

Id: [0x002121EE]
Angry snakes. A bad omen.

Id: [0x002121F3]
Only one myth speaks of turning victims to stone.

Id: [0x002121F6]
This looks like the way.

Id: [0x002121F9]
The Minotaur was just a man in a mask.

Id: [0x002121FB]
I've met the Minotaur... He's not what you think.

Id: [0x002121FD]
Your monster is no match for me or my spear.

Id: [0x002121FF]
Suuure.

Id: [0x00212201]
The Minotaur would be a match for any mortal... but wasn't it slain by Theseus?

Id: [0x00212267]
{I am looking to hire a misthios.}

Id: [0x002126DA]
That went well! It isn't exactly an invitation, but the promise of one is just as good. Although I'm sure he'll still ask Aspasia if it's OK.

Id: [0x002126DE]
Ah, Euterpe! There's plenty of wine left to buy. Don't fret.

Id: [0x002126DF]
I'll get her.

Id: [0x002126E0]
Yes, go. But don't forget about dear Duris, Kassandra!

Id: [0x002126E5]
Letters to and from the Cult... Gods, they have a foothold in every part of the Greek world. We're in more danger than I thought.

Id: [0x00212703]
My friend, Phidias, needs to be taken out of Athens as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00212704]
Anything else?

Id: [0x00212712]
Have you done all that Perikles asked?

Id: [0x0021277E]
Well?

Id: [0x0021277F]
Well... what?

Id: [0x00212780]
Hasn't been to a symposium in Athens, I figure.

Id: [0x00212781]
Or anywhere else, thanks.

Id: [0x00212783]
[sighing] Take off your clothes. And give him any weapons you've brought.

Id: [0x00212788]
I'm not easily parted with my spear. What do you want with it?

Id: [0x00212789]
[sighs] Polite Athenians tend to dislike being stabbed at dinner parties.

Id: [0x0021278B]
You expect me to walk in without clothes? I had no idea "polite Athenians" dined in the nude. Sounds like a party more in honor of Aphrodite than Athena.

Id: [0x0021278D]
I knew she were trouble.

Id: [0x0021278E]
Listen. You can stay in this room all night, if you'd prefer. But if you want into this party - and you <i>do</i> want into <i>this</i> party - you're going to surrender your precious blades. If you want anyone to take you seriously - and you <i>do</i> want to be taken seriously - you'll wear what I give you.

Id: [0x0021278F]
What's wrong with what I'm wearing?

Id: [0x00212790]
You're kidding.

Id: [0x00212792]
She's a stubborn one, ain't she?

Id: [0x00212793]
Your weapons will be safe and sound. I'll <i>personally</i> make sure Eukles here doesn't do anything to them.

Id: [0x00212797]
There. And now, your clothes.

Id: [0x0021279B]
I'm not some plaything for you to dress up. My clothes are staying on.

Id: [0x0021279E]
Athens is not the sort of place that takes kindly to those who are unwilling to compromise.

Id: [0x0021279F]
This city will break that part of you. Other parts, too.

Id: [0x002127A1]
Have it your way. But if even one of my "rags" goes missing, your neck and my blade will have a discussion.

Id: [0x002127A2]
I like her.

Id: [0x002127A3]
Yes, yes. You're both very scary, I'm sure.

Id: [0x002127A6]
They're the newest in Athenian fashion, I assure you.

Id: [0x002127A9]
You're like no servants I've ever met. You're lucky to serve a man like Pericles.

Id: [0x002127AA]
If you intend to give us some speech about how our sort - us working types - need to stick together, spare me. I don't know what Aspasia was thinking inviting you here, but don't forget who you are, and who she is. Who all of these people are. Never forget: you aren't one of them.

Id: [0x002127AB]
Neither are you.

Id: [0x002127AD]
There is one thing that unites us all, I suppose. Everyone in Athens tonight is an imposter of one type or another. Even me. Even you.

Id: [0x002127B6]
I'm always happy to help someone in need.

Id: [0x002127B8]
My life-saving services aren't free.

Id: [0x002127D4]
This line expresses anger, disappointment, or sadness.

Id: [0x002127F4]
Me? Rash?

Id: [0x002127FA]
And not much of a man at that.

Id: [0x002127FC]
- but it's all I have.

Id: [0x00212802]
Trust me, I know scams.

Id: [0x00212804]
Of course he's real!

Id: [0x0021280A]
Where can I find sharks around here?

Id: [0x0021280D]
Misthios, my humble hands have been commissioned to craft a bow using but a single fang from each a lioness, a lynx, and a shark. Do you have any?

Id: [0x00212811]
I have the fangs you need, if you're willing to negotiate a fair price for them.

Id: [0x00212812]
Of course! I know the value of a good tooth.

Id: [0x00212813]
Would your own mighty bow crafted from fangs be considered a "fair price"? It would have great... bite.

Id: [0x00212814]
Deal.

Id: [0x00212817]
I have other uses for these fangs.

Id: [0x00212818]
I suppose what you do with the teeth of beasts is your own business.

Id: [0x00212819]
Though... perhaps I could hire you to get more lion, lynx, and shark fangs for me? I'll make you a custom bow with them as payment...

Id: [0x0021281B]
Excellent!

Id: [0x00212824]
I freed some caged wolves earlier in the deforested area. Were those the "friends" you mean?

Id: [0x0021282D]
Time for a hunt.

Id: [0x0021282F]
That's the ones! I knew you were a true warrior when I first saw you. Take this bow as thanks. I must join my animal brethren now.

Id: [0x00212835]
I have what the physician asked for. I should take it back to the vineyard.

Id: [0x0021283A]
She said the medical tools are in Vrisa Fort...

Id: [0x0021283F]
The drugs are in the Leader House.

Id: [0x00212842]
Easy.

Id: [0x00212843]
- Which is why it was recently overrun with beasts even they can't tame.

Id: [0x00212844]
Ah.

Id: [0x00212847]
There's plenty of valuables to be found in Daidalos Fort.

Id: [0x00212848]
Stealing from there will hurt the Gortyn war effort most.

Id: [0x0021284B]
I'll think about it.

Id: [0x0021284C]
Blessed be the god that sent you here. I'd have been eaten alive if it weren't for you.

Id: [0x0021284D]
The world could do with more like you. Especially now.

Id: [0x0021284E]
Of course.

Id: [0x00212850]
Perikles sent me. He was worried about you. [beat]Do you often get tied up and surrounded by snakes?

Id: [0x00212853]
How can you joke about this? Thugs broke into my home, dragged me here, tied me up, and surrounded me with these hideous creatures. They must be stopped!

Id: [0x00212854]
Why would anyone do this?

Id: [0x00212855]
Politicians are easy targets in these troubled times. When they tied me up, they said <i>I</i> was a snake - that I should die by my own kind.

Id: [0x00212856]
Did you recognize the people who did this?

Id: [0x00212857]
I couldn't see their faces, but I recognized their voices from one of the districts I visited. They're regulars at Kleon's rallies - they live in the flooded part of the city near the wall.

Id: [0x00212858]
Where should I look?

Id: [0x0021285A]
Oh, yes?

Id: [0x0021285B]
They threw rotten food and yelled insults at me. These thugs disguised their faces, but their voices and the stench of fish were unmistakable.

Id: [0x0021285D]
Tensions are high right now. At this rate we'll tear each other apart within the city before the Spartans can breach the walls.

Id: [0x00212861]
You don't even have the drachmae, do you? Enough!

Id: [0x00212864]
An effective one, too.

Id: [0x00212866]
They sent word that the new leader was an eagle bearer.

Id: [0x00212868]
The Eagle Bearer... They sent word, but I didn't believe it.

Id: [0x00212869]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! No one ever believes me.

Id: [0x0021286A]
Just calm down and take me to the labyrinth.

Id: [0x0021286C]
Ardos!

Id: [0x002128D9]
I can see that now.

Id: [0x00212A4E]
The beach? Can she swim?

Id: [0x00212A5A]
There they are. I'll sneak up on the <i>malákes</i>.

Id: [0x00212A61]
Lemme go!

Id: [0x00212A62]
Shut it, or I'll tighten those ropes!

Id: [0x00212A63]
She'll make good ransom drachmae for the Cyclops.

Id: [0x00212A64]
No one's gonna buy me from you. They're all poor.

Id: [0x00212A66]
Keep quiet, Phoibe...

Id: [0x0021310D]
And my fee?

Id: [0x0021310F]
Raaaaa!

Id: [0x00213130]
It's not too late to make a difference, but we have to work together.

Id: [0x00213131]
Maybe you're right - you didn't have to show us mercy. But where do we start?

Id: [0x00213132]
You've crossed a line. Now you must pay the price.

Id: [0x00213133]
We'll never surrender to the likes of you. We will make Athens great again.

Id: [0x0021313C]
Murder is punishable by death.

Id: [0x00213149]
Follow me!

Id: [0x0021314B]
One of you is a traitor![beat] The Artifact will expose them.

Id: [0x00213182]
Oh no, these women are unlike any other you'll meet - a force, and the only ones there with any smarts.

Id: [0x00213183]
Prostitutes? This is serious.

Id: [0x00213184]
They don't like being called that. And for good reason. They offer so much more than their bodies.

Id: [0x00213185]
Such as?

Id: [0x00213186]
These women are companions. Counselors. Confidantes. Powerful men come to the hetaerae asking for advice, and value their words more than those of their closest friends and advisors.

Id: [0x00213188]
When you reach Korinth, find Anthousa. No one goes in - or out - of the city without her knowing. [beat]Until we meet again, warrior.

Id: [0x002131FE]
You attacked Metiochos. I found the snakes, the letter from your <i>friend</i>, and a body... all here.

Id: [0x00213201]
We all knew the risks. Change don't happen without a bit of blood being spilled.

Id: [0x00213210]
Why kill Metiochos with snakes?

Id: [0x00213213]
You can't take the law into your own hands. Now I need to decide what to do with you.

Id: [0x00213214]
Kleon says it's time we took the city back from the elite - time to fight. Don't matter what you do to us, there'll be others who follow our lead.

Id: [0x00213215]
I know someone gave you those snakes - they used you to do their dirty work. I want to know who.

Id: [0x00213218]
We're prisoners in our own city because of Perikles and his crooked friends. The snake dealer told us it's time to send a message - time they suffered.

Id: [0x00213225]
Tell me what I want to know, or I'll cut you down right now. Your cause will be forgotten and so will you.

Id: [0x00213226]
Don't be someone's puppet. Tell me where the snake dealer is.

Id: [0x00213227]
All right, all right. He's got a camp just outside the walls. Sells his snakes from there.

Id: [0x00213228]
He's a real hero of Athens. No puppet of Perikles is going to stop him.

Id: [0x002132ED]
I could rescue your husband, for a price.

Id: [0x002132F0]
Where should I look?

Id: [0x002132F1]
He always fishes on the west coast of Anaphi, just north of here.

Id: [0x00213376]
I'll take my chances. Where is he?

Id: [0x00213377]
He used to live at Fisherman's Beacon to the north - you could try your luck there.

Id: [0x002133D4]
"Someone, I tell you, in another time will remember us."

Id: [0x002133DB]
There's no escaping our fate, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00213419]
Today, we give everything we have.

Id: [0x0021341E]
No giving up!

Id: [0x00213423]
Kleon won't be far. We need to find him.

Id: [0x00213428]
Archers on the wall!

Id: [0x0021342D]
They need to be shot down![&scream] Now![/&scream]

Id: [0x00213437]
Turn back! Don't come any closer.

Id: [0x0021343C]
[&scream]Stop! [/&scream]I beg you!

Id: [0x0021390D]
Not exactly, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x0021390F]
No, I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x00213911]
No. Killing him is the only way.

Id: [0x00213913]
No, spill his blood.

Id: [0x00213917]
No, I want you to slay the beast.

Id: [0x00213919]
I'd rather you hunt the beast down.

Id: [0x0021391E]
No, I want you to kill her.

Id: [0x00213920]
I was thinking of something bloodier. Kill her.

Id: [0x00213922]
No, I want you to take her out.

Id: [0x00213928]
No, I want you to kill them all.

Id: [0x0021392A]
Actually, I want a blood bath. Kill them all.

Id: [0x0021392C]
I had something bloodier in mind. Send them all to Hades.

Id: [0x0021392E]
No, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to slay them all.

Id: [0x00213932]
No. Hunting the beasts down is the only answer. Make sure you get all of them.

Id: [0x00213934]
No, I want you to hunt all the beasts down.

Id: [0x00213937]
No, it needs to be destroyed.

Id: [0x0021393A]
No. Just destroy them all.

Id: [0x0021393D]
No, I just want you to set her free.

Id: [0x00213940]
No, no. I just want you to find him and set him free.

Id: [0x00213943]
No, I want you to bring it back.

Id: [0x00213946]
No, just deliver it safely.

Id: [0x00213949]
No, just bring this to him.

Id: [0x0021394C]
No, I just need this delivered to her.

Id: [0x0021394F]
No. The focus must be on protecting him at all costs.

Id: [0x00213952]
No! Your job is to protect her.

Id: [0x00213957]
No, the Spartan commander must die.

Id: [0x0021395D]
No, the Athenian commander must die.

Id: [0x00213961]
No. The bandit chief must die.

Id: [0x00213968]
Not exactly. This mercenary needs to die.

Id: [0x0021396A]
No. This mercenary scum must die.

Id: [0x00213970]
No, I want you to assassinate the leader.

Id: [0x00213972]
Actually, I need the leader dead.

Id: [0x00213979]
No. All the soldiers must be slain.

Id: [0x0021397F]
No. All the Spartans must die.

Id: [0x00213985]
No. All the Athenians must die.

Id: [0x00213991]
Well... no. I want you to slay all the goats.

Id: [0x00213997]
No. Destroy the shrine.

Id: [0x0021399B]
No, sink the ship.

Id: [0x0021399D]
Not quite. I need you to destroy the boat.

Id: [0x002139A8]
No, sink all the ships.

Id: [0x002139AA]
What I <i>want</i> is for you to bring your wrath to the sea and destroy all their ships.

Id: [0x002139AC]
Not strong enough. I want all their ships destroyed.

Id: [0x002139C2]
No, bring it to the merchant.

Id: [0x002139DC]
No, the area must be investigated.

Id: [0x002139FE]
By Zeus, you'd do that for me?

Id: [0x00213A00]
That's right.

Id: [0x00213A02]
That would be the plan.

Id: [0x00213A04]
Will you?

Id: [0x00213A06]
Yes. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x00213A08]
You read me like an oracle.

Id: [0x00213A0A]
Yes, exactly.

Id: [0x00213A0C]
The glory is all yours if you accept. Do you?

Id: [0x00213A0E]
I beg you.

Id: [0x00213A10]
The gods show me mercy. That is exactly what I desire.

Id: [0x00213A12]
That would be the idea, yes.

Id: [0x00213A14]
That would be ideal.

Id: [0x00213A16]
Are you up for it?

Id: [0x00213A18]
Exactly, my friend.

Id: [0x00213A1A]
That's exactly it. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00213A1C]
It should be an easy task for someone with your talent.

Id: [0x00213A1E]
I would be in your debt.

Id: [0x00213A20]
Then you understand.

Id: [0x00213A22]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x00213A24]
By the gods, you read my mind.

Id: [0x00213A26]
Obviously. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x00213A28]
Can I count on you?

Id: [0x00213A2A]
I knew I asked the right person.

Id: [0x00213A2C]
That's exactly it. Will you do it for me?

Id: [0x00213A2E]
You understand perfectly, then.

Id: [0x00213A30]
You understand quickly.

Id: [0x00213A32]
You catch on fast. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00213A34]
Ah. Not only do you possess the strength of Heracles, but the wits of Hermes, too.

Id: [0x00213AC6]
Yes. His death is the only answer.

Id: [0x00213AC8]
Yes. He must die.

Id: [0x00213ACA]
He must be struck down with all your strength.

Id: [0x00213ACC]
Yes, his death will solve everything.

Id: [0x00213ACE]
His blood must be spilled.

Id: [0x00213AD0]
Exactly. He must be gutted.

Id: [0x00213AD2]
His blood should stain the earth.

Id: [0x00213AD4]
I can't hide my desires. He must die.

Id: [0x00213AD6]
His death is the only solution.

Id: [0x00213ADF]
Yes, it must die.

Id: [0x00213AE1]
That's right. It can't live.

Id: [0x00213AE3]
View this as a sacrifice to the gods.

Id: [0x00213AE5]
Of course! It must be put to rest.

Id: [0x00213AE7]
If your blade moves as fast as your mind, it doesn't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00213AE9]
Exactly. It must die.

Id: [0x00213AEB]
Yes. Its heart must stop.

Id: [0x00213AF3]
Please, she must die.

Id: [0x00213AF5]
Yes, I want her dead.

Id: [0x00213AF7]
Yes, she must go to Hades.

Id: [0x00213AF9]
Yes, her time has come.

Id: [0x00213AFB]
Her death is the only solution.

Id: [0x00213AFD]
You have good instincts, <i>misthios.</i> I want her dead.

Id: [0x00213B06]
You understand quickly. I need every last one to die.

Id: [0x00213B08]
Yes. None should be left standing.

Id: [0x00213B0A]
Every last one of them must be slain.

Id: [0x00213B0C]
That's right. I want them all dead.

Id: [0x00213B0E]
All of them.

Id: [0x00213B10]
Yes, <i>misthios</i>. Each of them must die.

Id: [0x00213B12]
Exactly. None should be left alive.

Id: [0x00213B16]
Yes, all of them must die.

Id: [0x00213B18]
Yes, all of them must be gutted. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00213B1F]
Exactly. Nothing should be left of it.

Id: [0x00213B21]
Yes, it must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x00213B23]
You know your craft. Leave no trace.

Id: [0x00213B25]
Nothing should be left of it. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00213B27]
By Apollo, you understand. It needs to disappear.

Id: [0x00213B2D]
Exactly. Every last one of them.

Id: [0x00213B2F]
Yes, they all must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x00213B31]
No need to speak more. All must disappear.

Id: [0x00213B33]
Nothing should be left. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00213B3A]
By the gods, you understand. She must go free.

Id: [0x00213B3C]
Not an easy task but yes, she must escape.

Id: [0x00213B3E]
Yes, please. She must be rescued.

Id: [0x00213B40]
Exactly. She must go free.

Id: [0x00213B42]
I would be forever in your debt if she is freed.

Id: [0x00213B49]
By the gods, yes. He must be rescued.

Id: [0x00213B4B]
Not an easy task, but yes, I want him out of there.

Id: [0x00213B4D]
He must walk free.

Id: [0x00213B4F]
Please make sure he gets out of there safely.

Id: [0x00213B51]
I would be forever in your debt if he were saved.

Id: [0x00213B57]
Yes, I need it back at all costs.

Id: [0x00213B59]
Yes, it needs to be returned without a scratch.

Id: [0x00213B5B]
By the gods, I need it back. In one piece, please.

Id: [0x00213B5D]
Simple enough. I need it back in good shape.

Id: [0x00213B63]
Exactly. It must arrive without a scratch.

Id: [0x00213B65]
Yes, it needs to get there in one piece.

Id: [0x00213B67]
You got it. The job will be finished once it arrives.

Id: [0x00213B69]
Yes, simple enough. It needs to arrive in one piece.

Id: [0x00213B6D]
Yes, that's it. He needs it soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00213B6F]
Right. He'll be waiting for it.

Id: [0x00213B73]
Yes, you've got it. She needs it soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00213B75]
Yes, she must receive it. And soon.

Id: [0x00213B7A]
Yes, he must remain unscathed.

Id: [0x00213B7C]
Yes. Not a hand should touch him.

Id: [0x00213B7E]
No harm can come to him.

Id: [0x00213B83]
Please, she must remain unscathed.

Id: [0x00213B85]
She must be kept safe. Should be easy enough for someone as strong as you.

Id: [0x00213B87]
No harm can come to her.

Id: [0x00213B8D]
Yes, the general must die.

Id: [0x00213B8F]
It's not an easy task, but yes, the Spartan must be killed.

Id: [0x00213B95]
Yes, the Athenian commander must fall.

Id: [0x00213B9C]
I want the bandit leader dead.

Id: [0x00213B9E]
Yes, the bandit chief should die.

Id: [0x00213BA0]
Exactly. That bandit scum must be struck down.

Id: [0x00213BAA]
That's exactly it. The mercenary must die.

Id: [0x00213BAC]
I know it's a tall order, but I want this mercenary dead.

Id: [0x00213BAE]
It's time for this mercenary to meet Hades.

Id: [0x00213BB6]
The death of the leader would solve everything.

Id: [0x00213BB8]
Yes. The leader must fall.

Id: [0x00213BBA]
I know it's not an easy task, but the leader's death is the only solution.

Id: [0x00213BBC]
Precisely. The leader must die.

Id: [0x00213BC7]
Yes, the wolf must be slain.

Id: [0x00213BCC]
I understand this isn't an easy task, but the lion must be killed.

Id: [0x00213BD1]
I'm afraid this bear's death is the only solution. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00213BD6]
May the waters run red with the shark's blood.

Id: [0x00213BDC]
Yes, every one of those forsaken pirates must be struck down.

Id: [0x00213BDE]
That's it. Happy pirate hunting.

Id: [0x00213BE4]
No bandit should be left standing.

Id: [0x00213BE6]
All the bandits must die. Do we have an agreement?

Id: [0x00213BEB]
All the soldiers must die. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x00213BED]
All the soldiers must die. It's the only way.

Id: [0x00213BEF]
A few measly soldiers should be an easy mark for someone of your stature.

Id: [0x00213BF6]
Yes, those filthy Spartans must die.

Id: [0x00213BF8]
All the Spartans must be wiped out - every last one of them. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00213BFF]
Yes. Every last one of these Athenians must die.

Id: [0x00213C01]
Yes. All the Athenians must fall.

Id: [0x00213C18]
Heracles got his start with goats, didn't you hear?

Id: [0x00213C1A]
They might be bloodthirsty.

Id: [0x00213C1C]
Very <i>angry</i> goats. [beat]Will you do it?

Id: [0x00213C22]
Yes, the shrine must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00213C2A]
Let it rot at the bottom of sea.

Id: [0x00213C2C]
Yes, it must be sunk.

Id: [0x00213C2E]
If it sinks, I'll rest easy.

Id: [0x00213C30]
May the sharks feast on the crew. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00213C3F]
Yes, they all must sink. Do we have a deal, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00213C41]
Exactly, my friend. The horizon must be cleared.

Id: [0x00213C43]
The horizon should be clear of ships once you're done.

Id: [0x00213C45]
All the boats must be sunk. Every. Last. One.

Id: [0x00213C67]
Exactly. I want that drachmae. All of it.

Id: [0x00213C69]
Yes, all the drachmae must be found.

Id: [0x00213C6F]
If the merchant receives it, I'll be in your debt.

Id: [0x00213C96]
Yes, it must be investigated.

Id: [0x00213DBA]
You want me to destroy this shrine?

Id: [0x00213DBF]
So you want me to destroy a document?

Id: [0x00213DD1]
You want me to go diving for it?

Id: [0x00213E1A]
So you want me to give you some drachmae?

Id: [0x00213E20]
You want me to buy it?

Id: [0x00213E2C]
So you want me to give some to you?

Id: [0x00213E6D]
Yes, you may need to get wet but... I need it back.

Id: [0x00213E99]
No, it must be returned to me. Even if you need to go diving.

Id: [0x0021433C]
The warehouse is off limits.

Id: [0x0021433E]
But I <i>need</i> those records!

Id: [0x00214342]
What's going on?

Id: [0x00214345]
This matter is out of my hands.

Id: [0x002143A7]
That must be the leader.

Id: [0x00214523]
An Athenian on Spartan ground. [beat]Don't suppose a spy like you might need my help?

Id: [0x00214525]
Spying on Sparta, Athenian? Maybe you could use some help.

Id: [0x0021458D]
Heard the war efforts are slow going. Anything I can do to help?

Id: [0x00214591]
You're a long way from Athens, spy. Need any help?

Id: [0x0021459B]
The Cult has no interest in sentimentality. Or "family." Its only aim is control.

Id: [0x002145FD]
Yes, these documents must be destroyed.

Id: [0x002145FF]
Yes, they must be starved out.

Id: [0x00214601]
Yes, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00214603]
Exactly. Everything they have must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00214606]
No, the documents must be destroyed.

Id: [0x0021460E]
I can weather any storm.

Id: [0x00214625]
I think this might interest you. I took it from the commander after I killed him.

Id: [0x00214626]
Then we go to the Pnyx. If Perikles is anywhere, he's there.

Id: [0x0021462A]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x0021462C]
It wasn't so bad. Last time, they put a cloth in my mouth so I'd stop biting.

Id: [0x0021462D]
What'd they say?

Id: [0x0021462E]
They said the Cyclops put a <i>big</i> bounty on you. Talos the Stone-Fist wants you dead.

Id: [0x00214630]
Better get him before he gets you. I hear he's really mean.

Id: [0x00214636]
No, I want them to starve. Destroy their food.

Id: [0x0021463B]
No, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00214640]
No, destroy everything they have.

Id: [0x00214B2E]
The key is shaped like a disk. If they have it, it'll be there.

Id: [0x00214B32]
Guess the naked guy has moved on. I should as well.

Id: [0x00214B41]
Those malákas should've just kept the amulet here.

Id: [0x00214B46]
If that naked guy is right, the amulet should be in here.

Id: [0x0021591E]
Beep

Id: [0x00215B75]
[&laughs]And, uh, you better believe it!

Id: [0x00215B76]
<i>Here?</i>

Id: [0x00215B77]
...In <i>Lato?</i>

Id: [0x00215B78]
Yes.

Id: [0x00215B7E]
Yes.

Id: [0x00215B82]
I can't see any labyrinths or golden balls of string... but, if there's a Minotaur to be fought, I'm listening.

Id: [0x00215B85]
<i>This </i>Lato?

Id: [0x00215B86]
I assure you, the beast lives here, and he wants nothing more than a wealthy - uh, a <i>worthy </i>opponent to battle.

Id: [0x00215B88]
Then listen well, my observant friend!

Id: [0x00215BB0]
I have your <i>malákes</i> Tokens. No more games, no more schemes to rob me of my drachmae -

Id: [0x00215BB1]
Absolutely, <i>misthios</i>! No problem!

Id: [0x00215BB3]
But <i>first!</i>

Id: [0x00215BB7]
You've returned. Did you bring the proof I asked for?

Id: [0x00215BC1]
Huh, this might interest Kleon, and it'll give him the proof he wants.

Id: [0x00215BC7]
The commander was carrying this.

Id: [0x00215BD1]
What other choice do you have?

Id: [0x00215BD2]
There's a safe place I can escape to, but none of that matters if my girl can't find me. If I could just get this message to her... But the path is too treacherous.

Id: [0x00215FFC]
You know what it's about?

Id: [0x00215FFD]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00215FFE]
It seems I will need your services again, sooner than anticipated. One of my aides has been captured by the Spartans.

Id: [0x00216022]
What the fuck are you doing sniffing round my house?

Id: [0x0021606C]
They tested me there, but I left my boots behind when they kicked me out.

Id: [0x00216074]
My lamb! You've been gone so long.

Id: [0x00216075]
Brasidas is dead.

Id: [0x00216076]
No.

Id: [0x00216077]
Deimos killed him in battle.

Id: [0x0021607A]
<i>Malákas</i> Kleon! I'll kill him with my bare hands.

Id: [0x0021607B]
It's done, <i>mater</i>. I already sent that snake to the Styx.

Id: [0x0021607D]
My family...

Id: [0x0021607F]
You're all I have left.

Id: [0x00216082]
<i>Mater</i>, there's something I need to do.

Id: [0x00216084]
My whole life's been spent fighting and running. Running from my past, fighting to forget. I can't do this anymore.

Id: [0x00216086]
I need to go to Mount Taygetos, where it all began.

Id: [0x0021608A]
I need to put that night behind me, once and for all.

Id: [0x0021608D]
I'm coming with you.

Id: [0x0021609D]
I know... I'll become a priestess - and join a temple! Thank you, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x002160BE]
Your reaction betrayed you.

Id: [0x002160BF]
Why was the messenger trying to get to Mytilene?

Id: [0x002160C0]
Yes, the man mentioned in this note was on important business for Athens.

Id: [0x002160C1]
He was to help distribute supplies to the people there, to help them against their oppressors.

Id: [0x002160C8]
Who is this man to you? You look concerned.

Id: [0x002160C9]
He was only an aide - it was his mission that was important.

Id: [0x00217B89]
I don't yet know what to do with it.

Id: [0x00217C5D]
I'll expect you to use discretion.

Id: [0x00217C5E]
I had to make sure it was proof of what I did - it could have been anything.

Id: [0x00217C5F]
A good point. And because of this, I have another task for you.

Id: [0x00217C61]
I hope this proves I can be trusted to get the job done.

Id: [0x00217C62]
Proved you're competent, yes. Trusted... You did read the note.

Id: [0x00217D09]
I'll get it done.

Id: [0x00217D0A]
Good. Kill their commander Nabis, destroy their supplies, and return to me with proof of your exploits. Show them that we have teeth, too.

Id: [0x00217D13]
Keep it moving.

Id: [0x00217D15]
I'll distract them while you sneak out. Meet me tonight to set sail for Seriphos. Don't show your face until you see me at the docks.

Id: [0x00217D8D]
Here, take it.

Id: [0x00217DB9]
Thank you again. Don't forget to come see me under less stressful circumstances.

Id: [0x00217E07]
I need you to find my messenger, Heremos.

Id: [0x00217E08]
I don't suppose <i>you </i>know how to get this stain out.

Id: [0x00217E2C]
Is your stomach turning as much as mine is?

Id: [0x00217E2D]
You'll get used to it. We'll reach Seriphos before long.

Id: [0x00217E32]
I never thought I'd leave Athens for good.

Id: [0x00217E33]
I've left places I've called home.

Id: [0x00217E37]
Ah, yes, the kind and thoughtful hero you mentioned in your letter!

Id: [0x00217E39]
Perikles asked me to go down to the Fishing District and talk with the poor and sick - to give them hope. That's how I recognized their voices.

Id: [0x00217E3A]
I'll track them down, Metiochos. Don't worry.

Id: [0x00217E42]
So, he has a name now.

Id: [0x00217E43]
You Athenians use more words than anyone and still say nothing.

Id: [0x00217E44]
Every individual is important to the whole, but the majority must always take precedence.

Id: [0x00217E46]
I need you to find him, and make sure he reaches his ship.

Id: [0x00217E51]
They probably won't even kill me. They'll just enslave me like they did you.

Id: [0x00217E56]
Where should I look for Heremos?

Id: [0x00217E57]
If the Spartans have him, he'll be in the old quarry[2406436]. I have it on good authority they're holding all their prisoners there.

Id: [0x00217E5B]
Don’t see fishies like you everyday, eh?

Id: [0x00217E5D]
You hungry?

Id: [0x00217E5F]
How about we make a deal? I do something for you, you do a few things for me... Everybody wins.

Id: [0x00217E61]
Best offer you're gonna get! Think about it!

Id: [0x00217E64]
...Wait!

Id: [0x00217E6D]
Where's the ship I need to take him to?

Id: [0x00217E6E]
For now it's safer you don't know. Once you find him, he will tell you.

Id: [0x00217E7C]
Kassandra! It's you!

Id: [0x00217E7D]
Phoibe?

Id: [0x00217E82]
You promised we'd see each other again, and now we have!

Id: [0x00217E83]
You said you weren't coming back to Kephallonia, so I decided to leave too!

Id: [0x00217F88]
This was the messenger from the note?

Id: [0x00217F89]
Yes. It's imperative Heremos is freed and reaches the ship I've readied for him.

Id: [0x00217F8B]
What did you need from me?

Id: [0x00217F8C]
Free my messenger Heremos from the Spartan prison at the quarry[2406436], and escort him to my ship.

Id: [0x00217FC6]
Tell me about this messenger of yours.

Id: [0x00217FC7]
He is of no significance, but his mission <i>is</i>. Find him so he can complete it.

Id: [0x00217FC9]
What mission is your messenger on?

Id: [0x00217FCA]
The fewer people who know, the better - but understand, it is vital to the future of Athens.

Id: [0x00217FCE]
Don't worry. I'll get this Heremos of yours to the ship.

Id: [0x00217FCF]
There's something I must do first.

Id: [0x00217FD0]
Do not take this task lightly. Heremos's life, and the lives of many others, depend on this.

Id: [0x00217FD4]
I also said to stay out of trouble.

Id: [0x00217FD5]
Which I have!

Id: [0x00217FD7]
OK, almost out of trouble.

Id: [0x00217FD9]
I said I wouldn't be coming back, but I don't remember saying you should leave.

Id: [0x00217FDA]
Well here I am!

Id: [0x00217FE0]
How did you even get here, Phoibe?

Id: [0x00217FE3]
Well... I did make some drachmae working for Markos.

Id: [0x00217FE4]
So you paid someone to bring you to Athens?

Id: [0x00217FE5]
Not exactly.

Id: [0x00217FE6]
Phoibe.

Id: [0x00217FE7]
I needed the drachmae for when I arrived. I couldn't use it all to leave, and I didn't want to wait any longer, so I sneaked on a ship. Don't worry, nobody saw!

Id: [0x00217FE8]
I just can't believe you made it.

Id: [0x00217FFF]
Looks like I was too late for Heremos.

Id: [0x00218014]
I can't believe you're here.

Id: [0x00218015]
Me either! I can't believe we both made it to Athens. It's so much different from Kephallonia.

Id: [0x00218016]
But what are you doing here?

Id: [0x00218017]
I'm here to get you ready. I have to make sure you leave all your weapons and change into these clothes.

Id: [0x00218019]
So, you somehow work here... For Perikles.

Id: [0x0021801A]
No. For <i>Aspasia</i>.

Id: [0x00218023]
Thank you for helping us see the truth.

Id: [0x0021802B]
Thank you for your help, my friend.

Id: [0x00218052]
Run off with a Mytilene girl. Hmph!

Id: [0x0021805A]
[&breath]One day, you'll realize their future doesn't include people like us.

Id: [0x0021805C]
Then I wasn't meant to belong anywhere.

Id: [0x0021828F]
Bryce! Wait -

Id: [0x00218299]
It's getting hard to breathe. Even the air is... <i>dead.</i>

Id: [0x0021829E]
...What is this place? It's empty of life.

Id: [0x002182AC]
[sigh]I'll find your sons and pull them out of whatever trouble they've stumbled into.

Id: [0x002182AE]
This is ridiculous. Scam someone else.

Id: [0x002182BB]
Don't worry, I'll make sure your sons come home safe.

Id: [0x002182BF]
Is that Bryce? What's this temple doing in the forest?

Id: [0x002182C4]
I still need to find the Trial Master's other sons.

Id: [0x002182C9]
And that's the last of the sons. Better head back to the Trial Master.

Id: [0x002182CE]
These statues are unnervingly lifelike... and their faces are contorted in fear.

Id: [0x002182CF]
...The Writhing Dread. It's not safe in here.

Id: [0x002182D7]
It's been hours. Where are they? Why'd I have to get malákes boys?! Boys! BOYS! Come home! ...Mikon?

Id: [0x002182D8]
<i>Maláka...</i> better go after her.

Id: [0x002182DC]
This must be the Pre-Trial of Accuracy.

Id: [0x002182DD]
Hmm?

Id: [0x002182DF]
Oh! Yes! This is the Pre-Trial of... [changes from accuracy to accuraTELY]Accurately... finding my malákes sons!

Id: [0x002182E1]
Your sons? This doesn't sound like a Trial.

Id: [0x002182E2]
What trouble have they gotten into now? Their mother's going to feed me to that damned Minotaur...

Id: [0x002182E3]
Have you tried raising sons? It's perhaps the greatest Trial of all!

Id: [0x002182E5]
So if I find your sons and make sure they're safe, you'll give me your Trial Token?

Id: [0x002182E6]
You'll get my Token and my eternal gratitude!

Id: [0x002182E7]
They usually hide in the fields behind me. May I suggest you prepare yourself mentally and physically. This will be your greatest Trial yet, brave warrior!

Id: [0x002182E9]
But, but - there isn't anyone else to scam.

Id: [0x002182EA]
Only by completing the world-famous and totally legitimate Pre-Trial of Accurately Finding My Sons can you proceed and face... the Minotaur!

Id: [0x002182EB]
Aren't you supposed to ask if I'll buy the Trial Token from you?

Id: [0x002182EC]
You want to pay to win?! That's - ugh, aren't you a warrior? Where's your honor? Where's your sense of pride and accomplishment?!

Id: [0x002182ED]
If you want me to find your sons, I'll need to know more about them.

Id: [0x002182EE]
You said your sons are likely in the field, but I'll need more to go on.

Id: [0x002182EF]
They climb on everything - buildings, towers, the crops, oh the crops! They're exactly as tall as my sons, creating the perfect place for them to hide!

Id: [0x002182F3]
Please, their mother can't know how long they've been missing...

Id: [0x002182F5]
The Pre-Trial of Accurately Finding My Sons awaits you!

Id: [0x002182F6]
Wondrous, beautiful - but shits all the same. They won't listen to me, but perhaps they'll listen to you.

Id: [0x002182F9]
You must find all three of them! And hurry, there's only so long my wife will believe they're off praying at the temple.

Id: [0x002182FB]
They're little shits.

Id: [0x002182FC]
Not all of them, no...

Id: [0x002182FD]
Please, find them all. It's not like I love one more than the others!

Id: [0x002182FF]
Well, Mikon... Perhaps you need more information?

Id: [0x00218301]
Have you found all 3 of my sons?

Id: [0x00218302]
My sons! You brought them home!

Id: [0x00218304]
You were right, they are little shits.

Id: [0x00218306]
Of all my victories, this is the one I'll be most remembered for.

Id: [0x00218307]
Consider the Trial of Accurately Finding My Sons... COMPLETE!

Id: [0x00218326]
Help! Please, help me. I-I'm trapped up here!

Id: [0x00218332]
I warn you - pay to pass this Trial, potential champion. The Trial of Endurance has seen more deaths than all the other Trials combined!

Id: [0x00218337]
Only purchasing my Trial Token for a reasonable, currently discounted, price can save you from this Trial's <i>watery grave!</i>

Id: [0x0021833F]
If the Trial of Endurance is about enduring you, [&breath]I've already failed. Chaire.

Id: [0x00218340]
If you give up now, you'll never slay Pephka's World-Famous Minotaur!

Id: [0x00218345]
Afraid of a little water, potential champion? You must retrieve the Token from the bottom of the lake!

Id: [0x00218349]
Sharks. <i>sharks. </i>You didn't mention the sharks<i>...</i>

Id: [0x0021834A]
I said this Trial had claimed more lives than the others -

Id: [0x0021834F]
Just give me the <i>malákas</i> Token.

Id: [0x00218350]
Some might say you've paid to skip, others may call you an honorless coward... But know this: today you've invested in <i>not dying</i>. Excellent choice, [dramatic beat]champion.

Id: [0x00218353]
This isn't the "Pre-Trial of Being Cheap"! You don't have enough drachmae!

Id: [0x00218358]
You won't get one drachma from me. I'll do the Trial.

Id: [0x00218359]
[&ah]If an excruciating underwater death is what you desire, who am I to stop you? Remember, you'll find my Token in a chest at the bottom of the lake.

Id: [0x0021835B]
How exactly does going for a swim test my ability to slay the Minotaur?

Id: [0x0021835C]
...Minotaurs work in mysterious ways?

Id: [0x0021835E]
Your Token will be mine.

Id: [0x00218360]
No, please, I urge you - <i>pay me </i>for my Token. The watery dangers you must otherwise face to retrieve it are too great!

Id: [0x00218368]
Don't lose your Token, champion! [beat]But if you do, I can give you a <i>fantastic </i>deal on a replacement.

Id: [0x0021836F]
They'll listen to me.

Id: [0x00218373]
Were the others drunk when they jumped?

Id: [0x00218374]
Actually, yes. Very unprofessional of them.

Id: [0x00218375]
Should you survive the Champion's Dive, you'll need to retrieve my Trial Token from a chest in the darkest depths of the water below.

Id: [0x00218377]
<i>BUT YOU DIDN'T MENTION THE MALÁKES SHARKS!</i>

Id: [0x00218378]
Yes, well... [clears throat][&hmm]enjoy your Token, champion!

Id: [0x00218381]
That's the last Trial Token. Time to pay Leiandros a visit.

Id: [0x00218386]
I still need all three Trial Tokens before I can face the Pephka Minotaur.

Id: [0x002183A8]
No self-respecting Minotaur would live in Lato.

Id: [0x002183A9]
He does.

Id: [0x002183AE]
The Minotaur's expecting you. Oh yes, he's - he's sharpening his horns, and, uh, starving himself so he'll really savor every agonizing bite as he devours you. Are you ready to face him?

Id: [0x002183C0]
I'll be back soon.

Id: [0x002183C5]
If you don't get the oil soon, all our fun will end.

Id: [0x002183CF]
On the edge of the world, a mother calls out to her child. Touching.

Id: [0x002183D1]
Alexios, please.

Id: [0x002183D2]
You use that name as if it means something to me.

Id: [0x002183D3]
It's the name your father and I gave you.

Id: [0x002183D4]
Was that before, or after, some prophecy had you cast me from this mountain?

Id: [0x002183D5]
It was the Cult. I tried to save you. I did everything! The priests told me you were dead.

Id: [0x002183D7]
And they told me you abandoned your son!

Id: [0x002183DE]
Alexios, come to me.

Id: [0x002183E0]
We are your family. We can go home.

Id: [0x002183E2]
Family? Home?[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]

Id: [0x002183E4]
My sword is my family. The battlefield is my home.

Id: [0x0021843D]
I suppose you've come in here to mock me for my fight with Euripides?

Id: [0x0021844E]
I thought politics was a game to you, remember? It is. And I play to win.

Id: [0x00218459]
Back for more? I knew you would be.

Id: [0x0021845E]
I could use a little break.

Id: [0x0021845F]
Oh, it won't be little. But things <i>will </i>break.

Id: [0x00218468]
Maybe I'll come back later.

Id: [0x00218469]
I hope you do.

Id: [0x00218470]
Are you finally here for some fun?

Id: [0x00218472]
The people have chosen their destiny, Kassandra - they've chosen me.

Id: [0x00218476]
I still have some energy left.

Id: [0x00218477]
Lucky for you, so do I.

Id: [0x0021847F]
I told you <i>mater</i>, he's too far gone.

Id: [0x00218481]
Too far gone? Is that what you told mater? Why didn't you tell her the truth?

Id: [0x00218483]
I've seen a lot of fights. That wasn't one.

Id: [0x00218484]
There's a war at the city walls. Suffering. Starvation. And you're in here arguing because... someone at the party isn't giving you the attention you need?

Id: [0x00218486]
I told you, <i>mater</i>. He's beyond reason.

Id: [0x00218488]
Beyond reason? Is that what you told mater? Why didn't you tell her the truth?

Id: [0x0021848B]
You're not giving me much time to rest, are you?

Id: [0x00218490]
There's no need for rest. We can do that later.

Id: [0x00218499]
Fuck you, Kleon.

Id: [0x0021849C]
Isn't there a symposium you should be experiencing?

Id: [0x002184A1]
There is, but you're in here.

Id: [0x002184A2]
I'm not entirely sure you're human.

Id: [0x002184AA]
I guess I can let you rest a little.

Id: [0x002184AB]
Or even a lot is fine with me.

Id: [0x002184B0]
I'm sorry, but I can't. It's too much even for me.

Id: [0x002184B2]
I'm glad you said that. Since first we met, I've been trying to figure out what you are to me.

Id: [0x002184B4]
You're a weed. Trying to choke and destroy everything I've planted. [&breath]And you know the best way to kill a weed...

Id: [0x002184B6]
Is at the root.

Id: [0x002184B9]
Right you are.

Id: [0x002184BB]
Open this door, or I'll kick it in!

Id: [0x002184BD]
[&ah]Don't mind her. She likes to watch. [&hmm]Look at you.

Id: [0x002184C0]
Such authority, such aggression. I can see why Perikles has taken such an interest in you. Did you come to join us?

Id: [0x002184C3]
It sounded like someone was in pain.

Id: [0x002184C4]
Well, it can sometimes be... hard to distinguish between sounds of pleasure and pain. Had I known <i>you</i> were going to knock, I would have left my door wide, <i>wide</i> open for you.

Id: [0x002184DF]
I watched as the lioness tore my friend to bloody shreds.

Id: [0x002184E0]
Even in the world of beasts, a <i>family </i>protects its young.

Id: [0x002184E3]
I loved you. I still love you.

Id: [0x002184E6]
The Cult controls your destiny, but you don't need them. Together, we can destroy them and bring peace back to this world.

Id: [0x002184EB]
Just tell me what to do.

Id: [0x002184F0]
We're all after something, even you.

Id: [0x002184F2]
You're better at reading others than you let on.

Id: [0x002184F7]
I'm looking for a woman who's very important to me. Herodotos said a symposium could be useful for gaining information.

Id: [0x002184F9]
He would be correct. I can get you in, although I can't promise the information you seek will be found.

Id: [0x002184FE]
So long as it comes.

Id: [0x00218504]
Peace? And what under Helios would you do with yourself if there was peace? Milk the goats? [&laughs][[laughs]][/&laughs] Look at you, oh mighty misthios. You profit from this war as much as I do. You don't want peace - you just don't want to deal with me.

Id: [0x00218505]
What I want - what I've always wanted - is my family.

Id: [0x0021850B]
I'll get changed. Promise you'll take care of my things?

Id: [0x0021850C]
Yep. Leave your weapons in the corner, and I'll come back when you're done.

Id: [0x0021850F]
I feel... uncomfortable in this.

Id: [0x00218510]
Now you look like everyone else.

Id: [0x00218511]
You say that like it's a good thing.

Id: [0x00218512]
It is! If you want them to take you seriously, this is the easiest way. Trust me.

Id: [0x00218514]
I don't understand why I have to change.

Id: [0x00218515]
It's just what you do here. I felt weird at first, but you forget about it pretty fast.

Id: [0x00218516]
And my weapons?

Id: [0x00218517]
Don't worry, I'll take care of them! You don't want to scare people in there.

Id: [0x00218518]
Well...

Id: [0x00218521]
How is it you're working for Aspasia?

Id: [0x00218522]
Well, I did get into a little bit of trouble after I got to Athens. I may have been the leader of a small group of orphans that tried to cheat Aspasia. We didn't know it was her, though!

Id: [0x00218528]
I promised to bring him back, <i>mater. </i>But the Cult has poisoned his mind.

Id: [0x0021852A]
Promised to bring me back to mater did you?[&laughs] You didn't bring me here.

Id: [0x0021852C]
And you... convinced her to hire you?

Id: [0x0021852D]
No, she asked me on her own!

Id: [0x0021852E]
That was lucky.

Id: [0x00218531]
I don't remember much of Athens from when I was a baby, but every once in a while, something feels familiar. It's nice.

Id: [0x0021854F]
Is that everything?

Id: [0x00218550]
You're all ready to go in! Don't worry, you've done scarier things than this.

Id: [0x00218553]
I'm struggling to think of any right now. Are you sure I can't keep just one weapon with me?

Id: [0x00218554]
No weapons! Now, hurry and go in. Oh, and don't leave without saying bye!

Id: [0x00218561]
Approach me.

Id: [0x00218562]
And what of my son?

Id: [0x00218566]
Kleon shot him in the back with an arrow. He fell. I don't think he survived.

Id: [0x00218569]
Kleon fired an arrow into Deimos's back. The wound didn't look fatal - he could still be alive.

Id: [0x0021858E]
But... the <i>maláka</i> in charge of Lesbos keeps trading our product with other city states. He's gaining influence, and we're losing profits.

Id: [0x00218ACD]
So you want me to kill this Follower of Ares?

Id: [0x00218AD5]
The rodent follows the cheese, but the snake swallows the rodent.

Id: [0x00218B00]
Get the <i>fuck </i>off my streets.

Id: [0x00218B01]
So you'd like me to wipe out the Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x00218B07]
Yes. The Follower must die.

Id: [0x00218B0A]
No, all the Followers must die.

Id: [0x00218B10]
No, just slay the Follower.

Id: [0x00218B16]
Yes. All the Followers must die.

Id: [0x00218B1A]
Yes, every little bit helps.

Id: [0x00218B1D]
Yes. Any drachmae you can give helps.

Id: [0x00218B20]
Yes, the location is yours... if you're willing to pay for it in drachmae.

Id: [0x00218B31]
No, I just want you to give me some.

Id: [0x00218B34]
No, I just need some drachmae.

Id: [0x00218B37]
No, I'll give you the location... for a price.

Id: [0x0021AD6D]
I freed all the wolves, but they were enraged and quickly attacked me. I had to defend myself.

Id: [0x0021AD6E]
You were supposed to free them, not kill them. I thought you were one of us.

Id: [0x0021AD6F]
At least they died free, and not in cages. The others you rescued will help me take revenge on those stone-dwellers.

Id: [0x0021AD8C]
I... I don't know what to say.

Id: [0x0021AD8D]
There are no words. Leave me now.

Id: [0x0021AD93]
I miss my friend. I can't even look at my art - it reminds me of him.

Id: [0x0021ADA4]
You can reverse the effects?

Id: [0x0021ADA5]
My elixir can.

Id: [0x0021ADA6]
I mean... not yet. I'm trying to reverse the effects of petrifaction by concocting an elixir of various ingredients.

Id: [0x0021ADA7]
Give it to me! A friend of mine was recently turned to stone.

Id: [0x0021ADA8]
I can't. I don't have all the ingredients.<LF>

Id: [0x0021ADAB]
But... if you could get them for me, I could give you a vial of it as a reward.

Id: [0x0021ADB5]
Hush, my child. May Hera bless our sacred family.

Id: [0x0021ADB6]
You don’t understand. This isn’t just about fire and wheat. This is personal.

Id: [0x0021ADB7]
What is a leader if he hides behind the walls he built himself? Send me fire, storm, or sickness, but bring me justice for my city.

Id: [0x0021ADB8]
We will destroy your statues. We will burn down your temples if that's what it takes to rid the world of rodents like you.

Id: [0x0021ADB9]
You’ve seen it yourself, the future belongs to us now. Old gods and new be praised.

Id: [0x0021ADBA]
The Cult is nothing without me. Even the gods cower in my wake. Kneel or die.

Id: [0x0021ADBB]
Ares has chosen me to lead the Spartans to glory. There can be only one.

Id: [0x0021ADBC]
I swear on my life, and the lives I will take from others, I will not fail the Kosmos again.

Id: [0x0021ADBD]
Extend to me your olive branch, and I will take the grove.

Id: [0x0021ADBE]
The steps to the Parthenon are long and built on corpses.

Id: [0x0021ADBF]
One half without the other is nothing at all. I have nothing left to lose.

Id: [0x0021ADC0]
One person's freedom is another's demise.

Id: [0x0021ADC1]
When deciding where our loyalties lie, we must consider the end.

Id: [0x0021ADC2]
What's one life worth without a thousand others behind it?

Id: [0x0021ADC3]
I spent twenty years at sea only to realize the Cult was my home.

Id: [0x0021ADC4]
The fight is only over when I'm the last man left standing.

Id: [0x0021ADC5]
Kosmos demands to know the secrets hiding in the hearts of men. So I simply cut them open.

Id: [0x0021ADC6]
I will follow Deimos to the Underworld, and bring my hordes with us.

Id: [0x0021ADC8]
My heart was shattered on that mountain.

Id: [0x0021ADCB]
Do you trust the face you see in your reflection? I don't.

Id: [0x0021ADCC]
The Cult has existed for decades and will exist for centuries more.

Id: [0x0021ADCD]
Kosmos fights for Athens. And so Athens fights for Kosmos.

Id: [0x0021ADCF]
I will lead those who oppose us to the gates of the underworld. Kosmos be my guide.

Id: [0x0021ADD2]
There is no victory without eternal war. The Kosmos guide me.

Id: [0x0021ADD3]
Who needs democracy when drachmae rules the world?

Id: [0x0021ADDA]
I admit, I'm surprised to see you here. But, "everything has a price," as you said. I can't help but wonder what price you paid to gain entry to this symposium.

Id: [0x0021ADDB]
Keep wondering.

Id: [0x0021ADDF]
Ah, here comes the one who claims to value drachmae over the noble path that leads to knowledge.

Id: [0x0021ADE0]
Like I told you, "knowledge" can't feed me.

Id: [0x0021ADE1]
But the mind must be fed as well!

Id: [0x0021ADE4]
Ah, if it isn't the one who agrees that knowledge is most important!

Id: [0x0021ADE5]
I think we agreed our use of that knowledge couldn't be more different.

Id: [0x0021ADE6]
[&ah]You remember! Perhaps that conversation can continue.

Id: [0x0021ADE8]
Being so new to Athens, and gaining access to this symposium, is no small feat. Though you said there are things you wouldn't do, you gained Perikles's trust so quickly...

Id: [0x0021AE17]
I've made my choice.

Id: [0x0021AE1A]
The one you love is dead. My destiny is clear. And I won't let you [&mumble]get in my way.[/&mumble]

Id: [0x0021AE26]
Was that before, or after, you brought me to this mountain to die?

Id: [0x0021AE39]
The Cult is my family. The battlefield is my home.

Id: [0x0021AE3D]
Talos the mercenary? [&phew]Am I ever not in trouble?

Id: [0x0021AE3E]
Maybe you should have kept sailing past.

Id: [0x0021AE44]
[&grunt]They lied to me.

Id: [0x0021AE5D]
[beat]I'll find my way back to town. <i>Chaire</i>!

Id: [0x0021AE66]
You just said a general isn't self-serving when he brings order to his troops. Then you said he <i>is</i> self-serving because retreating would save the lives of his men. What are you trying to say?

Id: [0x0021AE67]
I never <i>try</i> to say anything.

Id: [0x0021AE68]
But you <i>just</i> said those things.

Id: [0x0021AE69]
I said the words, but I didn't <i>say</i> anything at all. I only attempted to gain your view on the matter.

Id: [0x0021AE6A]
You're wasting your time.

Id: [0x0021AE6E]
I've already had conversations like this with you, Sokrates. I'm not in the mood to spend the rest of my night standing here.

Id: [0x0021AE6F]
I'd never ask you to do such a thing! You've said plenty, and I feel I know you even better now.

Id: [0x0021AE70]
Go while you still can. Perhaps you've loosened his ears to my point.

Id: [0x0021AE72]
Let me ask you one final question.

Id: [0x0021AE92]
Over here! Help me, please.

Id: [0x0021AE99]
Save me! Please, get me out of here.

Id: [0x0021AEA0]
Thank you. My legs... You'll have to carry me.

Id: [0x0021AEA8]
Thank you...

Id: [0x0021AEA9]
I need to get to my ship. I'll reward you well.

Id: [0x0021AEAE]
You have a ship?

Id: [0x0021AEAF]
Yes. I came inland to meet an associate. You might have seen him… He enjoyed Spartan hospitality at the end of a rope.

Id: [0x0021AEB0]
Heremos? I was sent to rescue him.

Id: [0x0021AEB3]
We can still complete the mission if you help me.

Id: [0x0021AEB5]
Tell me who you are.

Id: [0x0021AEB6]
Captain Onomakles. I'm on an urgent mission. I need to get out of here.

Id: [0x0021AEB7]
Spartan patrols could find us at any moment.

Id: [0x0021AEB9]
Please don't leave me to die here. If you won't help me, help Athens. Get me to my ship.

Id: [0x0021AEBD]
I'll get you to your ship. Just point me in the right direction.

Id: [0x0021AEBE]
It's on the coast... Just south of Marathon Beach.

Id: [0x0021AEC0]
You have your freedom, but I have other things to do. Good luck.

Id: [0x0021AEC7]
Your compassion for the people has always inspired me.

Id: [0x0021AEC8]
Unfortunately compassion is all I have to give. The gods have shown me how arrogant I had become.

Id: [0x0021AECA]
What if you get sick?

Id: [0x0021AECB]
It seems I am immune.

Id: [0x0021AED2]
I need help if I'm to clear the streets of bodies, especially now that the Followers of Ares want my head.

Id: [0x0021AED5]
You took far longer than I expected.

Id: [0x0021AEDA]
You just got here. You can't leave already!

Id: [0x0021AEDE]
Seems your crew met the same fate as you.

Id: [0x0021AEDF]
I don't blame Heremos for talking. Spartans lack the most basic empathy.

Id: [0x0021AEE0]
Stay here. I'll kill the Spartans, destroy their ships, and free your crew.

Id: [0x0021AEE7]
You look tired!

Id: [0x0021AEE8]
Only of conversation. I think that's the most talking I've ever done.

Id: [0x0021AEE9]
See, you didn't need a weapon after all! Are you leaving?

Id: [0x0021AEEB]
You get used to it. It's nice!

Id: [0x0021AEEC]
What are you going to do now?

Id: [0x0021AEF9]
You've done Athens a great service. On my return I will make sure to acknowledge it.

Id: [0x0021AEFA]
Well, you did mention payment.

Id: [0x0021AEFB]
More than that, you will have earned the favor of some powerful people when they hear of what you've done.

Id: [0x0021AF02]
I'm not interested in who I impress. I just want my drachmae.

Id: [0x0021AF03]
Take it, but I know you have a heart in there somewhere. Remember, you didn't have to save me.

Id: [0x0021AF04]
You were right. There was some kind of artifact there. It showed me a vision... of me and my mother.

Id: [0x0021AF07]
It's fine. Let them through.

Id: [0x0021AF08]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0021AF09]
I may have told Kassandra you'd invite her to your symposium.

Id: [0x0021AF0A]
You'd ask me to exclude every Athenian and invite an outsider instead? You heard the crowd. They don't need another reason to hate me.

Id: [0x0021AF0C]
A politician and ally. He's one of my most loyal friends.

Id: [0x0021AF0D]
Metiochos... you said he was your colleague?

Id: [0x0021AF0E]
There's a woman on the island of Keos that I need to meet. I think I'll head there first.

Id: [0x0021AF0F]
I've heard there are pirates there!

Id: [0x0021AF10]
There's a woman in Korinth I'd like to talk to.

Id: [0x0021AF11]
I've heard about that place from Alkibiades... he says you don't go there to talk.

Id: [0x0021AF12]
There's a physician in Argolis that may be able to help me.

Id: [0x0021AF13]
You're sick? You've never been sick!

Id: [0x0021AF14]
I'll be sure to be careful.

Id: [0x0021AF15]
Good!

Id: [0x0021AF17]
Alkibiades says a lot of things.

Id: [0x0021AF18]
He sure does!

Id: [0x0021AF1A]
No, no, I'm fine. I just need to talk to him.

Id: [0x0021AF1B]
Okay, good! It would be weird if you were sick.

Id: [0x0021AF1D]
Not going to beg to come along this time?

Id: [0x0021AF1E]
Nope! I'm happy here, and this isn't Kephallonia. That means you'll be back!

Id: [0x0021AF1F]
That's very true.

Id: [0x0021AF20]
Plus, I really like working for Aspasia. She says she has a mission for me!

Id: [0x0021AF21]
I'll see you soon, Phoibe.

Id: [0x0021AF23]
Bye, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0021AF27]
You can think what you like. My purse is still heavier than it was.

Id: [0x0021AF2D]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0021AF2E]
I've said enough, and my ship awaits. Thank you again, misthios. I hope we'll meet again.

Id: [0x0021AF2F]
I hear it's useful to have powerful friends.

Id: [0x0021AF30]
The way the world is now, you need them more than ever.

Id: [0x0021AF33]
Look alive there! She's not going to sail herself.

Id: [0x0021B87C]
Ah, Phoibe. Perikles has retired to the balcony already, has he? His ability to sneak off and sulk is second to none.

Id: [0x0021B880]
Now, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Aspasia. [beat]I had to go to great lengths to cover up your work in Megaris.

Id: [0x0021B884]
I have no idea what you're talking about.

Id: [0x0021B886]
Your spies have been watching me. I knew you people couldn't be trusted.

Id: [0x0021B88A]
We do what we must to survive, and there's no shame in that. It's how you got here - how <i>I</i> got here. [beat]The clothes, they fit you well, I trust?

Id: [0x0021B88E]
These may be the nicest clothes I've ever worn, but I feel... a bit uncomfortable, to be honest.

Id: [0x0021B890]
I'd be more comfortable in these clothes if I had a blade in my hand.

Id: [0x0021B896]
It seems we have the attention of the entire room without a single eye being fixed on us. If you'd like to talk, do it now, and do it discreetly.

Id: [0x0021B89A]
I'm searching for a woman who fled Sparta with her child years ago. I was hoping you might help.

Id: [0x0021B89C]
I've been searching for a woman named Myrrine... My mother. I think she may be in danger, and my search brought me here.

Id: [0x0021B89F]
What clues do you have to her whereabouts?

Id: [0x0021B8AA]
When you're done, return here. Together, we will find who you're looking for.

Id: [0x0021B8AB]
Thank you, Aspasia.

Id: [0x0021B8AD]
There <i>is</i> another option. In a former life, when I needed something done, or someone found, I contacted a friend. An admiral, of a sort.

Id: [0x0021B8AE]
What's his name?

Id: [0x0021B8AF]
<i>Her</i> name is Xenia. When we last spoke, she was in Keos. [beat]A word of caution: when you go to her, be on your guard. Sea life makes a monster out of most people.

Id: [0x0021B8B9]
It's lucky your "friend" warned you.

Id: [0x0021B8BD]
Oh I'm sorry, you need all three Trial Tokens before you face the Minotaur! He's, uh, he's <i>veeery </i>picky! Haha!

Id: [0x0021B951]
Perhaps you'd like to <i>buy back </i>your exquisite, finely-crafted Trial Tokens? This offer will expire in -

Id: [0x0021B953]
<i>It's time to slay a Minotaur!</i>

Id: [0x0021B955]
BY THE GODS!

Id: [0x0021B956]
They, uh make for fantastic gifts!

Id: [0x0021B958]
Oh but champion, surely you want something to help you remember the Pephka Pre-Trials?!

Id: [0x0021B9C0]
If you say so.

Id: [0x0021B9C3]
Why don't you tell our <i>mater</i> the truth?

Id: [0x0021B9C4]
And what truth is that?

Id: [0x0021B9C5]
You're [&breath]nothing [&breath]but a mercenary with a [&breath]broken spear.

Id: [0x0021B9C7]
That <i>I'm </i>the chosen one. The one with a destiny. <i>I</i> will bring order to this world.

Id: [0x0021B9DD]
Cut these malákes in half, my king!

Id: [0x0021B9E6]
Hold nothing back! Give everything you've got!

Id: [0x0021B9EF]
Release the fury of the gods!

Id: [0x0021B9F8]
Leonidas fights with the rage of Achilles!

Id: [0x0021BA02]
My king! Send these invaders to Hades!

Id: [0x0021BA46]
There were... complications.

Id: [0x0021BA48]
In what way?

Id: [0x0021BA49]
Your messenger was dead by the time I arrived, but I was able to free the captain, and the ship sailed. [beat]So I still did the job.

Id: [0x0021BA4A]
[&ah]Poor Heremos... but I should be thankful for your initiative.

Id: [0x0021BA4D]

Id: [0x0021BAAC]
You don't seem very concerned about "poor Heremos".

Id: [0x0021BAAD]
Every struggle has its sacrifice. Heremos played his part well.

Id: [0x0021BAAE]
What's in Mytilene that's so important?

Id: [0x0021BAAF]
People. We need as many allies as we can gather.

Id: [0x0021BAB4]
This was more than I bargained for.

Id: [0x0021BAB5]
You'll be amply compensated. You have done me and the people a huge service. One day you will see your part in this great work.

Id: [0x0021BAB6]
I travel a lot, but it's often at the service of others. I can be so focused on drachmae that I lose sight of what's in front of me.

Id: [0x0021BAB7]
And what's that?

Id: [0x0021BAB8]
The ocean breeze on my face. The sun on my skin. A sturdy horse to ride.

Id: [0x0021BABB]
Nowhere. The recent storms must've caught him. If they were close enough to the island, they might've been forced into Stormfall Bay. I'd check there.

Id: [0x0021BABF]
I wasn't expecting you back so soon. Do we have a problem?

Id: [0x0021BAC0]
Your messenger was dead when I arrived. There was nothing I could do.

Id: [0x0021BAC1]
Very well. If you'll excuse me. I have to find out what happened to my ship.

Id: [0x0021BAC9]
Kassandra?

Id: [0x0021BACA]
I don't recall sending for you, <i>misthios</i>. Phoibe shouldn't have let you in here.

Id: [0x0021BAD2]
You've been hiding from your guests long enough. Aspasia seems to think so, too.

Id: [0x0021BAD4]
She usually does.

Id: [0x0021BAD6]
Aspasia told me to come find you. She wants you to come down to the party.

Id: [0x0021BAD8]
She says I don't interact with our guests enough. But these parties aren't for me.

Id: [0x0021BADA]
Phoibe did nothing wrong. Aspasia asked her to let me in.

Id: [0x0021BADC]
Of course she did. I can't say I'm thrilled about going down and speaking to everyone.

Id: [0x0021BADE]
Technically you're a guest. If you join Herodotos and me, that should be enough for her, don't you think?

Id: [0x0021BADF]
You really don't want to go downstairs, do you?

Id: [0x0021BAE0]
When your days are spent speaking in front of crowds, you begin to crave these moments of silence.

Id: [0x0021BAE1]
Or as silent as I let it be, at least.

Id: [0x0021BAEA]
Phidias was awaiting trial, but you had me get him out of Athens. I figured you, of all people, would want to follow the law.

Id: [0x0021BAEB]
Phidias is a very dear friend. I didn't want to risk him being found guilty. And, of course, there were other threats.

Id: [0x0021BAEC]
So you knew.

Id: [0x0021BAED]
I know he's delusional, but... one day when you have a friend you'd do anything for, you'll understand.

Id: [0x0021BAEE]
I don't understand why you had Anaxagoras ostracized. Sokrates said he was your friend.

Id: [0x0021BAF1]
I won't risk the lives of those close to me if there's something I can do about it.

Id: [0x0021BAF2]
So you did this to protect him?

Id: [0x0021BAF3]
Anaxagoras understood my fears. Ten years may be a long time, but at least he'll be safe.

Id: [0x0021BAF4]
Why send Metiochos to the fishing district if it's dangerous?

Id: [0x0021BAF5]
I would have never sent him into danger willingly.

Id: [0x0021BAF6]
It seems you have many loyal friends.

Id: [0x0021BAF7]
My people are important to me.

Id: [0x0021BAF8]
Your life is in danger.

Id: [0x0021BAF9]
Yes, yes. Herodotos was saying. This Cult doesn't worry me - I have my life threatened by far worse people every day. [beat]My true concern is Athens. I fear for her future.

Id: [0x0021BAFD]
The Spartans aren't your real concern, Perikles. The Cult is coming. And they're bringing their strongest weapon.

Id: [0x0021BAFE]
The Spartans are immediate. A Cult's threat is ambiguous.

Id: [0x0021BB00]
Sound counsel to consider. I'll be sure to let my men know regardless.

Id: [0x0021BB01]
Spartans outside the walls, people crammed inside... I don't envy you.

Id: [0x0021BB02]
Even so, there isn't another city I'd rather live in.

Id: [0x0021BB03]
I can't say I know how that feels.

Id: [0x0021BB04]
When you find your place, you'll know it.

Id: [0x0021BB0C]
Aspasia sent me to see what's taking you so long.

Id: [0x0021BB0E]
Tell Aspasia I'll be right there.

Id: [0x0021BB10]
I suppose this is where our conversation ends. Thank you again for helping me. I hope my guests are able to help you in your search.

Id: [0x0021BB11]
Time will tell.

Id: [0x0021BB32]
I better check the northwest shoreline.

By Zeus, that's a relief.

Id: [0x0021BB81]
You'll be doing divine work

Id: [0x0021BB85]
I knew our paths were fated to cross.

Id: [0x0021BB8C]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021BB90]
Thank the gods! And you, too.

Id: [0x0021BB94]
The gods sent you my way for a reason.

Id: [0x0021BB9B]
There's a lot riding on this.

Id: [0x0021BB9F]
Get this done quickly, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021BBA3]
Don't let me down.

Id: [0x0021BBB0]
I would rather die than be a slave.

Id: [0x0021BBB3]
We do what we have to to survive.

Id: [0x0021BBC8]
Fine, the wheels of Euboea will be greased once more. How much will it cost to get me the records?

Id: [0x0021BBC9]
That's not going to work this time, Agapios. The guards are under strict orders not to let anyone in or out of the warehouse. It's an order they will enforce, my friend.

Id: [0x0021BBCC]
Ha. He's just as corrupt as the rest of Euboea. I fear there's nobody honest left.

Id: [0x0021BC3F]
<i>Oh my bones!</i> They are EXTREMELY broken. Don't be a fool - please, you must pay to skip this Pre-Trial!

Id: [0x0021BC47]
By Zeus, my legs! If only I hadn't tried to fight the Trial Master. I should have paid him. I SHOULD HAVE PAID HIM!

Id: [0x0021BC4B]
The pain! The incredible pain! My limbs and organs - crushed. If only I'd paid for the Trial Token. What an incredible, fairly priced deal!

Id: [0x0021BC52]
HE CANNOT BE BEATEN! He's too strong. Your only logical choice is to purchase the Trial Token from him. Be wise, friend.

Id: [0x0021BC59]
Put down your spear and grab your drachmae, challenger - for only honorable bribery can save you from sharing my astoundingly painful fate!

Id: [0x0021BC75]
Are we on break now? My legs are <i>actually </i>starting to cramp.

Id: [0x0021BC76]
This has got to be the best acting job in all the Greek world! Anyone got some olives?

Id: [0x0021BC77]
By the Gods, the <i>misthios</i> actually beat him! Do we still get paid, or...?

Id: [0x0021BC78]
Taxation records don't concern me. You're on your own.

Id: [0x0021BC79]
I can't do this alone. See me again if you decide you <i>do</i> want to earn some drachmae.

Id: [0x0021BC7A]
You've returned! I can't find the identity of the person leading The Dagger without those records. Please, you must help me find them!

Id: [0x0021BC7B]
You're back - but where are the records? Without them I'll never uncover the leader of The Dagger!

Id: [0x0021BC7E]
[&breath]They never listen when I call for them -

Id: [0x0021BCBB]
These bastard Spartans may have taken Megaris, but we're not done yet.

Id: [0x0021BCBD]
The situation is dire, but we cannot just give up. All of the Greek world looks to Athens. We must do what we can.

Id: [0x0021BCBE]
Not giving up in the face of defeat is a good quality in times like these.

Id: [0x0021BCC6]
So what are you doing here instead of manning the walls of Athens?

Id: [0x0021BCCA]
Look around. It looks like you're done to me.

Id: [0x0021BCCB]
What choice do we have? The Spartans hate not just us, but our way of life. We have to defend it for everyone's sake.

Id: [0x0021BCCC]
My orders are to sabotage the Spartan advance from behind their lines.

Id: [0x0021BCCD]
Let me guess, you're struggling to make a difference?

Id: [0x0021BCCE]
I am only one man after all. Athens could use the help of a strong mercenary.

Id: [0x0021BD6F]
Aspasia.

Id: [0x0021BD70]
[&breath]Oh, Kassandra. You've returned to Athens.

Id: [0x0021BD77]
It's as loud as a battlefield out there. And as violent.

Id: [0x0021BD78]
They're calling for Perikles's head - as though he should know how to handle this catastrophe. <i>No one </i>is prepared for the end of the world.

Id: [0x0021BD7A]
It's bleak, but it hasn't killed you.

Id: [0x0021BD7B]
You're right. [beat]But everything Perikles has built is being destroyed. It's chaos outside these walls. People have forgotten how to be people.

Id: [0x0021BD7D]
[beat]I came to talk to you. I found out some things about my mother. Her name, her ship...

Id: [0x0021BD80]
Kassandra, it's not the time. [beat]Perikles is dying. He won't see me. He won't let Hippokrates in his room... He only babbles about going to his precious Parthenon.

Id: [0x0021BDB9]
Not now.

Id: [0x0021BDFD]
Perikles is a strong man. I'm sure he can fight the sickness.

Id: [0x0021BDFE]
You heard the mob - he can't defend himself. He'll die with no glory.

Id: [0x0021BDFF]
Athens has known him a lot longer than they've known this plague. He gave them a voice. His accomplishments will speak for him.

Id: [0x0021BE01]
The reason I came back to Athens was to talk to you about Myrrine.

Id: [0x0021BE02]
Your mother will live to see tomorrow. My love won't live to see another sunset.

Id: [0x0021BE03]
You've had <i>many </i>sunsets with him. I've spent all my nights alone.

Id: [0x0021BE07]
Perikles needs treatment, and the gods know he won't let me in. He respects you. Could you go to him?

Id: [0x0021BE08]
I could try.

Id: [0x0021BE0E]
Is there nothing that can be done?

Id: [0x0021BE11]
The plague is spreading through the victims' excretions - I'm sure of it. The bodies must be burned.

Id: [0x0021BE42]
Focus on the wolves.

Id: [0x0021BE47]
What's <i>left</i> of Athens. The world we've built is crumbling at our feet.

Id: [0x0021BE87]
With Perikles out of the way, we can finally make a move on those Spartan pigs.

Id: [0x0021BEA2]
You know... This job isn't always what I expected... Or even wanted. Watching good people die every week... [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x0021BEA6]
The last thing in the world I ever thought I'd be was a deserter... But then, I never thought things would get bad enough that I'd consider deserting. [beat]Fuck it. I'm in.

Id: [0x0021BEAA]
I've always wanted to sail and see the world... But upper ranks always passed me over for naval command postings. [beat]I guess sometimes what you want doesn't come the way you'd expect. I'm in.

Id: [0x0021BEB1]
If you're willing to travel with a spy, I'll join you. I can gather far more information sailing around the world than I can when I'm stuck here.

Id: [0x0021BEB5]
You want to sail with a spy? You're more trusting than you look. [beat]All right, I'll join you.

Id: [0x0021BEB9]
Not many people would trust a spy aboard their ship. But it would give me some much needed mobility. [beat]I'm in.

Id: [0x0021BED9]
Desert my post? And my forces? Never.

Id: [0x0021BEDD]
What do you take me for? A deserter? I would never leave my forces.

Id: [0x0021BEE1]
Abandon my post? I'm a commander, <i>misthios</i>, not a coward. You'll have to make do without me.

Id: [0x0021BEE8]
Unfortunately, there's too much afoot here for me to sail the world with you, <i>misthios</i>. I've got to maintain my post undermining those Spartan dogs.

Id: [0x0021BEEC]
Even spies have families, <i>misthios</i>, and mine is here. I can't join you, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x0021BEF0]
Spies work best alone. You'll have to make do without me.

Id: [0x0021BEF7]
Perikles was a mighty ruler, who did what he did to protect you all.

Id: [0x0021BEF8]
He made us hide behind the city walls while the Spartans burned our farms and murdered our brothers and sisters. We need to strike back, and hard.

Id: [0x0021BF2F]
Perikles tried to protect his people, but he did more harm than good.

Id: [0x0021BF30]
We've spent too long hiding from the fight. We need to give the Spartans something they will never forget.

Id: [0x0021BF31]
Perikles's death leaves Athens open to even more danger than before. You're all just too stuck up to realize it.

Id: [0x0021BF33]
What's done is done, and all we soldiers are left with is anger. We want to make a move on the Spartans, whether you're with us or not.

Id: [0x0021BFAC]
If you do, I will make the time to talk about your mother. For now, he needs your help.

Id: [0x0021BFAD]
It's worth a shot.

Id: [0x0021BFF5]
You should have bought my Token, yes? Very good price! Now you must pay a <i>new </i>price...<i> DEATH.</i>

Id: [0x0021BFFF]
Crush, crush, crush...

Id: [0x0021C005]
<i>UGH!</i> This isn't what winning feels like...!

Id: [0x0021C007]
I will use your bones to pick your <i>other </i>bones from my teeth!

Id: [0x0021C00D]
Did Agapios send you?

Id: [0x0021C00F]
Were you followed?

Id: [0x0021C010]
No.

Id: [0x0021C011]
Are you <i>sure</i> you weren't followed?

Id: [0x0021C01F]
What exactly went down with the ship?

Id: [0x0021C03C]
I will get whatever's down there.

Id: [0x0021C03E]
I can't help you right now.

Id: [0x0021C046]
Fear not, cowardly challenger - I will tell no one of your shameful bribery! Only the gods and the ceaseless whispers of your conscience shall know the truth. Yes!

Id: [0x0021C049]
Where exactly is the shipwreck[2105455]?

Id: [0x0021C04B]
I have enough to go on.

Id: [0x0021C04D]
Have you returned to help put an end to The Dagger? They're still sending their men down into that shipwreck[2105455], so something important must still be there.

Id: [0x0021C052]
There must be <i>something </i>in the shipwreck[2105455]!

Id: [0x0021C055]
If you wish to brave the waves in the Trial of Endurance, you must first speak with Leiandros in Lato.

Id: [0x0021C05C]
Stay away, potential champion. You have too much to live for... Only spending a quite affordable amount of drachmae can save your soul!

Id: [0x0021C05D]
Fine, I'll pay for your <i>malákas</i> Trial Token.

Id: [0x0021C05E]
Here.

Id: [0x0021C064]
Beware the snakes in the grass...

Id: [0x0021C066]
Medusa was alive and causing the petrifaction. I was able to enter her lair and slay her, so there'll be no more people turned to stone.

Id: [0x0021C067]
Medusa... she was real? It matters not. What matters is saving the poor souls presently trapped. My elixir can save them, I know it.

Id: [0x0021C06E]
Now to find those records.

Id: [0x0021C078]
Directly south of here. You can't miss it, some of the debris is still visible on the surface.

Id: [0x0021C079]
It was my master's boat that engaged The Dagger's ship, but he and many of his men perished in the ensuing battle.

Id: [0x0021C096]
A <i>misthios</i>...! Destroy the records before they claim them!

Id: [0x0021C0AC]
Destroy the evidence!

Id: [0x0021C0D3]
[laughs cheekily]You'll never fiiind meeee...!

Id: [0x0021C0DA]
Ouch... My arm!

Id: [0x0021C0DC]
I'm not trapped - you can go away now. I'm not even in here!

Id: [0x0021C0E2]
You're actually getting further away from me. I can't even hear you anymore. Oh no, where did you goooo?!

Id: [0x0021C0E7]
I DON'T NEED HELP!

Id: [0x0021C0F6]
Mm. I can't believe they listened to you.

Id: [0x0021C10D]
What do you think is going on?

Id: [0x0021C10F]
I don't know. What I do know is that it kills without discrimination. Rich, poor, philosopher, or farmer - and I'm helpless to stop it.

Id: [0x0021C126]
Leaking, pustulant rashes, raging fevers, pallid, sweaty skin. I find many dying in their own excrement.

Id: [0x0021C128]
What's happening to the victims?

Id: [0x0021C160]
We're only mortal, and the gods like to remind us whenever they can.

Id: [0x0021C161]
Then you can continue to give comfort to those who aren't.

Id: [0x0021C164]
Perikles won't deny you. Please, bring him his drugs.

Id: [0x0021C169]
Aspasia, my light, I told you...

Id: [0x0021C16A]
It's Kassandra.

Id: [0x0021C16C]
Yes. Come in.

Id: [0x0021C172]
It's embarrassing - someone so strong seeing me like this.

Id: [0x0021C173]
I brought your drugs.

Id: [0x0021C175]
It's a shadow of what it was.

Id: [0x0021C177]
I wish to see it with my own eyes. Come, to the balcony.

Id: [0x0021C179]
I'm sorry Hippokrates, there's too much that I have to do.

Id: [0x0021C17E]
Come on, place your bets. Place your bets now! Aletes has plenty of drachmae for you to win...

Id: [0x0021C17F]
Your pitch could use some work. You'd attract more customers if you sounded more... enthusiastic.

Id: [0x0021C180]
Just... go see what's wrong. See if there's a way to help him win... For Athens. For drachmae!

Id: [0x0021C189]
These Followers of Ares don't worry me. I'll help burn the bodies.

Id: [0x0021C18D]
I'll see what's wrong with Pithekos.

Id: [0x0021C19A]
Everyone's betting against Pithekos. Rumor is, he's off his game. If it's true, I'm going to be ruined!

Id: [0x0021C19D]
All right. Let's hear <i>your</i> plan, then.

Id: [0x0021C1B0]
Kassandra? What are you... it's no matter. Leave Athens while you can. This city is dying.

Id: [0x0021C1B1]
I met with Perikles. Aspasia said he refused your help.

Id: [0x0021C1B2]
There's little I can do for him anyway.

Id: [0x0021C215]
Thank you! I'll split the winnings with you if you can sort things out.

Id: [0x0021C221]
Please, burn the corpses, and beware the fanatics trying to stop us. I can't lose you, too.

Id: [0x0021C292]
If that's all you need, you go check on him.

Id: [0x0021C2E3]
It's not the ship, but its cargo. It must reach its destination.

Id: [0x0021C2E8]
What's so important about this ship?

Id: [0x0021C2E9]
Then what's the cargo?

Id: [0x0021C2EA]
I'm not ungrateful for your help, but it's better you don't know.

Id: [0x0021C2EB]
Why's that?

Id: [0x0021C2EC]
Just believe me. What we do is for the security and future of Athens. This mission must succeed.

Id: [0x0021C2ED]
My payment relies on it. So trust me, it will.

Id: [0x0021C2F5]
I met Pithekos. You're right - he's worried he won't win.

Id: [0x0021C2F9]
Please see what's wrong with Pithekos. He needs to win!

Id: [0x0021C2FB]
Do what you can to help him. If he loses, I lose too!

Id: [0x0021C2FE]
I really need someone to check on Pithekos the javelin-thrower. If he doesn't win, my business is sunk!

Id: [0x0021C36F]
I should be out there on the streets.

Id: [0x0021C37E]
Pithekos, Aletes sent me to help you.

Id: [0x0021C37F]
Really? Can you perform wonders?

Id: [0x0021C380]
Aren't you meant to use the official javelins?

Id: [0x0021C381]
Yes, but... It was my <i>lucky</i> one. I can't win without it.

Id: [0x0021C395]
It's not the gods' fault. It's the world - it's turned upside down.

Id: [0x0021C396]
Athens's fate is decreed. All we can do now is wait.

Id: [0x0021C397]
The gods definitely aren't in Athens. I hardly recognize it here - it's like the Tartarus.

Id: [0x0021C39B]
Do any of your fellow Olympians have <i>special</i> javelins?

Id: [0x0021C39C]
Perhaps...

Id: [0x0021C39D]
Don't worry, I'll get you a javelin.

Id: [0x0021C39E]
Thanks! Maybe I've still got a chance to win...

Id: [0x0021C3A0]
Where would I find such a javelin?

Id: [0x0021C3A1]
Well, you could buy one, I suppose.

Id: [0x0021C431]
You're back. Have you killed them?

Id: [0x0021C433]
You again. Have you killed him?

Id: [0x0021C439]
You. Have you killed her?

Id: [0x0021C43D]
<i>Misthios</i>! Has the beast been slain?

Id: [0x0021C443]
Were you able to free him?

Id: [0x0021C447]
You're back. Were you able to free her?

Id: [0x0021C453]
<i>Misthios</i>! Were you able to keep him safe?

Id: [0x0021C457]
Were you able to protect her?

Id: [0x0021C462]
Has he been... dealt with, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021C466]
Has she been... taken care of, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021C46C]
Back already. Did you destroy them all?

Id: [0x0021C470]
You again. Has it been destroyed, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021C47B]
Did you get it?

Id: [0x0021C487]
Have you done what I asked?

Id: [0x0021C489]
Tell me it's been handled, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021C48B]
I trust you were successful?

Id: [0x0021C48D]
Do you bring me good news, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021C48F]
You're back. Finished already?

Id: [0x0021C495]
Light, strong, and looks exactly like a real Olympic javelin. I think Pithekos can win with this.

Id: [0x0021C497]
I've never seen anything like this.

Id: [0x0021C49A]
You'll find out as soon as I do.

Id: [0x0021C49F]
I really need that javelin soon. Make sure it's light and can pass for an official one.

Id: [0x0021C4A5]
Well, it's... pointy. I guess Pithekos could throw it.

Id: [0x0021C4AA]
This looks pretty good. Maybe Pithekos will approve.

Id: [0x0021C4AD]
I got you a javelin.

Id: [0x0021C4B1]
Good! Let's take a look.

Id: [0x0021C4CC]
I couldn't do this without you.

Id: [0x0021C4D0]
Thank you. Please take care of this quickly.

Id: [0x0021C4D4]
You're doing me a huge service, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021C4DB]
The gods must be smiling on me.

Id: [0x0021C4DF]
It must be done quickly. You have my thanks.

Id: [0x0021C4E3]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. I couldn't do this without you.

Id: [0x0021C4EF]
Hey, this javelin's amazing! Light, easy to handle, and most importantly, looks just like the real thing.

Id: [0x0021C4FC]
This is terrible... So heavy. Zeus himself couldn't throw it!

Id: [0x0021C508]
I'm glad I could help. Go with Nike, my friend.

Id: [0x0021C51A]
You should go back inside. You need to rest.

Id: [0x0021C51B]
Aspasia's right.

Id: [0x0021C51C]
She often is. [&breath]But not about this.

Id: [0x0021C51E]
Yes. I'll go inside. Thank you, Kassandra. Tell my Aspasia I was a good boy and took my drugs.

Id: [0x0021C522]
Ahh, the Delos Islands! Two sides of the same coin. [beat]Delos, sacred birthplace of Artemis and Apollo. And Mykonos, where people do everything that's forbidden on Delos.

Id: [0x0021C52F]
I know so. Throw this javelin and... prove your point.

Id: [0x0021C530]
I'll do it. Thanks, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021C534]
The javelin is just a tool. You're the real winner. You didn't get all the way to the Olympic Games just to lose.

Id: [0x0021C535]
You think so?

Id: [0x0021C537]
Does the note say where Kyra is?

Id: [0x0021C538]
There are two locations marked. A camp along the northwestern coast, and a hideout[2315766] that looks like it's... underneath the city.

Id: [0x0021C552]
Well, it will belong to Kleon now. He will have to lift it out of its sorry state.

Id: [0x0021C575]
I'll catch up with you later.

Id: [0x0021C58F]
If this javelin isn't good enough, I'll find another.

Id: [0x0021C590]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0021C5B3]
I should find Aletes.

Id: [0x0021C5D0]
Superstition must be part of being an Olympic athlete... Under the eyes of the gods and all.

Id: [0x0021C5D2]
When you say "lucky," you mean <i>special</i>. As in made to give you an advantage.

Id: [0x0021C5D4]
Look, my javelin was hollow as a reed and nearly as light. But it looked just like an Olympic one.

Id: [0x0021C5D5]
If you really want to help, bring me another like it, and I'll win the Games for Athens... And Aletes.

Id: [0x0021C603]
I'm glad I could help. Now, Aletes, for my winnings...

Id: [0x0021C604]
Of course! It was a good day - we all profit.

Id: [0x0021C606]
May your good fortune continue.

Id: [0x0021C634]
It's no use! Pithekos lost. His javelin barely cleared his hand. I'm ruined!

Id: [0x0021C635]
We all lost...

Id: [0x0021C65F]
Need something, blacksmith?

Id: [0x0021C68B]
Do I really look like a spy to you?

Id: [0x0021C68E]
Sure. I'm a god. You think it's wise to throw blades first and ask questions later?

Id: [0x0021C69C]
I will.

Id: [0x0021C6BA]
Looking for a fight, mercenary? You don't look quite as gutless as those pathetic Athenians.

Id: [0x0021C6BB]
Those "pathetic" Athenians seem to be a step ahead of you today.

Id: [0x0021C6BC]
They may have surprised us, but they're no match for our mighty warriors. [beat]Are you prepared to join the winning side?

Id: [0x0021C6C0]
<i>Misthios</i>. We're having trouble finding fresh blood to defend against those slimy Athenians... [beat]Well, fresh blood that knows which end of a sword to hold.

Id: [0x0021C6C1]
I've made it this far, haven't I?

Id: [0x0021C6C2]
That's the spirit. What do you say, interested in raising a shield for Sparta today?

Id: [0x0021C6C6]
Can't get those god-fucking Athenians off our backs, and a battle's brewing along our defenses. Interested in fighting alongside true warriors for Sparta today, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021C6CA]
[&ah]You're not the tallest warrior, but you'll do. We need mercenaries to bolster our offensive push against those filthy Athenians. Care to join our army?

Id: [0x0021C6CE]
<i>Misthios</i>. Care to forge a name for yourself in the fires of Spartan glory? We need greater numbers on the battlefield if we're to gain ground on those cowardly Athenians.

Id: [0x0021C6D2]
You look like you could use a fight. If it's a beautiful death you're after, join the Athenians. But if you seek glory, come join a <i>real</i> army.

Id: [0x0021C6D3]
I'm not looking for death or glory, Spartan. Just drachmae.

Id: [0x0021C6D4]
Don't worry, we always pay our hired help - the ones that survive, at least.

Id: [0x0021C6D8]
Ah, Eagle Bearer. I thought the gods might have forsaken Sparta, what with the Athenian vermin infesting our land. But seeing you here makes me think they've heard our prayers.

Id: [0x0021C6D9]
What do you need?

Id: [0x0021C6DA]
Those filthy Athenians have been pushing on our borders long enough. Join us on the battlefield and send them to Hades, where they belong.

Id: [0x0021C6DE]
If it isn't the mighty misthios with the broken spear... How would you like to raise that blade alongside Spartan warriors?

Id: [0x0021C6DF]
Depends how much true Spartan warriors can pay.

Id: [0x0021C6E0]
A capable <i>misthios</i> such as yourself would be well compensated. Care to share in our upcoming victory against the Athenians?

Id: [0x0021C6E4]
Maybe Zeus is favoring Sparta after all, if the mighty Eagle Bearer has arrived. Have you come to defend our borders against the Athenian scum?

Id: [0x0021C6E8]
The mighty warrior with the broken spear. Your timely arrival puts us in the perfect position for a push on Athenian borders... If you'll join us on the battlefield, of course.

Id: [0x0021C6EC]
Eagle Bearer! Here to share in our coming victory?

Id: [0x0021C6ED]
You seem pretty confident about the battle ahead. What makes you so certain you'll win?

Id: [0x0021C6EE]
After many skirmishes, we've finally got those Athenian dogs cornered... With your help, we can send them running with their tails between their legs. What do you say?

Id: [0x0021C6F2]
Great timing, Eagle Bearer. We're ready to advance on Athenian borders, and Sparta could use a warrior like you on our side. Interested in turning the tides of war in our favor?

Id: [0x0021C704]
Any chance you've reconsidered my offer to partake in Spartan glory?

Id: [0x0021C708]
Ready to earn your place among Sparta's greatest warriors?

Id: [0x0021C70C]
Come to join us on the battlefield, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021C710]
You're back. Maybe you'd like to earn some drachmae after all?

Id: [0x0021C714]
Hello again, <i>misthios</i>. We're still willing to share our victory with you, if you've changed your mind.

Id: [0x0021C718]
Sparta has my sword and all my strength behind it.

Id: [0x0021C719]
Glad to hear it. May Ares favor us today.

Id: [0x0021C71D]
You have my sword, Spartan.

Id: [0x0021C71E]
Excellent. Today is a lousy day to be an Athenian.

Id: [0x0021C722]
I'll join you.

Id: [0x0021C723]
Good. We're glad to have your sword.

Id: [0x0021C727]
You've got my sword, Spartan.

Id: [0x0021C728]
Good. We'll need all the iron we can get.

Id: [0x0021C72C]
I'll share in your victory... and your spoils.

Id: [0x0021C72D]
Live to see the end of the battle and you'll get your due, misthios.

Id: [0x0021C731]
I can't join you on the battlefield today, Spartan. I'm busy.

Id: [0x0021C732]
If you change your mind before the fight, come find me. Even latecomers get their due.

Id: [0x0021C736]
I'm not interested in a fight today.

Id: [0x0021C737]
Think over my offer before the fight begins. My soldiers are well compensated for their efforts.

Id: [0x0021C73B]
Not now. Maybe I'll join you another time.

Id: [0x0021C73C]
We pay well, <i>misthios</i>. Come see me if you change your mind before the fight.

Id: [0x0021C740]
You'll have to fight without me today.

Id: [0x0021C741]
My offer stands up until the fight begins if you change your mind.

Id: [0x0021C745]
I'm too busy to join you right now.

Id: [0x0021C746]
If you change your mind, my offer stands until we go to war.

Id: [0x0021C753]
Anything you need today, blacksmith?

Id: [0x0021C758]
<i>Chaire</i>, blacksmith. Is there anything a mercenary can help you with?

Id: [0x0021C75A]
Ah, yes. [&breath]It's usually Phoibe who does the delivering. At least I'm alive[&breath]… [/&breath]Though I can't say the same for my city.

Id: [0x0021C75F]
Perikles let me in. He took his drugs without complaint.

Id: [0x0021C760]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0021C762]
Something wrong?

Id: [0x0021C763]
I expected Phoibe back by now.

Id: [0x0021C764]
I saw her in the crowds outside. Did you send her somewhere?

Id: [0x0021C765]
I had her go to Anastasios to see about a ferry. As soon as Perikles is strong enough, we're leaving Athens. We have to.

Id: [0x0021C766]
But now she's missing.

Id: [0x0021C767]
I'm sure she's all right.

Id: [0x0021C79E]
By Poseidon, thank you.

Id: [0x0021C7A2]
I can rest easy, then.

Id: [0x0021C7A6]
The gods are smiling on me.

Id: [0x0021C7AD]
Thank you, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021C7B1]
I'm in your debt.

Id: [0x0021C7B5]
You're a gods-send.

Id: [0x0021D9F5]
Chaire, mercenary. If you've got a battle-ready boat nearby, my Spartan forces are looking to make an offensive push on the Athenian navy.

Id: [0x0021D9F6]
Surely even Sparta knows Athens has the superior navy. Sounds like I'd be signing up my ship to be destroyed.

Id: [0x0021D9F7]
With enough boats for hire, we'd have the numbers to turn the tide. What do you say? Ready to sail to victory?

Id: [0x0021D9FB]
You look out of place on Athenian land, Spartan.

Id: [0x0021D9FC]
Maybe on land, but Spartans won't be out of place on Athenian waters for much longer.

Id: [0x0021D9FD]
Oh?

Id: [0x0021D9FE]
If you've got a battle-ready crew, join my forces in an attack on the Athenian navy. You'll be well paid for your effort.

Id: [0x0021DA02]
<i>Chaire.</i> You blend in well, but not well enough. Surely you can't be here to gain ground for Sparta alone?

Id: [0x0021DA03]
Not ground, but water. My forces are targeting Athenian ships in the coming battle. If you've got a capable crew, why not join us as we sail to glory?

Id: [0x0021DA9F]
Anything a mercenary can do for you, philosopher?

Id: [0x0021DAA4]
Need anything, philosopher?

Id: [0x0021DAA9]
<i>Chaire</i>, philosopher. Anything a mercenary can do for you today?

Id: [0x0021DAB1]
<i>Chaire</i>, statesman. I don't suppose you could use a mercenary's help today?

Id: [0x0021DAB6]
Need something, statesman?

Id: [0x0021DABB]
Anything a mercenary can do for you, statesman?

Id: [0x0021DAC3]
<i>Chaire</i>, stranger. Need something?

Id: [0x0021DAC8]
Hello there. Need some help?

Id: [0x0021DACD]
Anything a mercenary can do for you, stranger?

Id: [0x0021DAD2]
Have you thought over my offer?

Id: [0x0021DAD7]
Having second thoughts?

Id: [0x0021DADC]
Will you help me after all, mercenary?

Id: [0x0021DAE1]
Have you reconsidered my request?

Id: [0x0021DAE6]
Come to your senses in time to make some drachmae?

Id: [0x0021DAF7]
My thanks, mercenary. You know, I could use someone with your... talents.

Id: [0x0021DAFB]
You have my thanks, mercenary. [Beat]But there's something else I could use your help with.

Id: [0x0021DB04]
Thank you for jumping in. Come to think of it, I could use a mercenary of your caliber.

Id: [0x0021DB08]
Thank you for stepping in, friend. You know, I can think of another use for your skills.

Id: [0x0021DB12]
I owe you my life, <i>misthios</i>. But before I can repay you, I need to call on your help again.

Id: [0x0021DB17]
I never thought I'd get out alive, mercenary. But now that I'm free, there's something else I could use your help with.

Id: [0x0021E0B8]
I knew you'd see reason.

Id: [0x0021E0BC]
You'll be just what I need.

Id: [0x0021E0C0]
Many thanks, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021E0C7]
Thank you. Please be discreet.

Id: [0x0021E0CB]
Get this done quickly.

Id: [0x0021E0CF]
You're doing me a service, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021E0D6]
Good. Be discreet.

Id: [0x0021E0DA]
This will be good for both of us.

Id: [0x0021E0DE]
I'm sure this will be worth your while.

Id: [0x0021E29D]
You know I've and seen pondered a great many things here, but there's still so much more of the Greek world to contemplate. I'm in.

Id: [0x0021E2A1]
A true scholar must see the world to contemplate its complexity. I'll join you.

Id: [0x0021E2A5]
Adventuring across the Aegean with you? No need to deliberate, I'm in.

Id: [0x0021E2AC]
I've amassed a great deal of power in my time here. Yet, I can't help but imagine there's more to be gained elsewhere in the Greek world. I'll join you.

Id: [0x0021E2B0]
For all I've gained here, I still long for adventure. Perhaps this is the opportunity I've been waiting for.

Id: [0x0021E2B4]
I have a lot to lose by leaving... But the potential of what I could gain calls to me. I'll join you.

Id: [0x0021E2BB]
Traveling with a crew like yours would give me a great deal of... access to many valuable things. I'm in.

Id: [0x0021E2BF]
We make a good team, mercenary. And I'm ready to see how far this partnership can go.

Id: [0x0021E2C3]
You're exactly the opportunity I've been waiting for, mercenary. I'm in.

Id: [0x0021E2CE]
I'm no sailor, mercenary. I prefer to ponder the ocean's depths from the shore.

Id: [0x0021E2D2]
My life here is comfortable. Lets me think more clearly. I'm afraid I can't leave that behind.

Id: [0x0021E2D6]
Some great scholars travel to expand their minds, but I prefer to keep safe on dry land.

Id: [0x0021E2DD]
Far too much is afoot here for me to be gallivanting across the Aegean, my friend.

Id: [0x0021E2E1]
I can't abandon my position to sail with you, mercenary. Too many rivals would rise to fill it.

Id: [0x0021E2E5]
My life, my family, and my work - it's all here, friend. I can't leave that behind.

Id: [0x0021E2EC]
I appreciate all you've done, <i>misthios</i>, but my line of work is best done alone.

Id: [0x0021E2F0]
I appreciate the offer, <i>misthios</i>, but I'm far too much of a solo artist to join your crew.

Id: [0x0021E2F4]
The promise of all the riches that await across the sea is tempting. But there's plenty of profit to be had here, as well. I can't join you.

Id: [0x0021E322]
You disappoint me, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021E325]
Only a fool could have failed this.

Id: [0x0021E328]
Maybe I misjudged you after all, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021E32B]
It seems I had an error in judgement, sending you for this.

Id: [0x0021E32E]
This plan was foolproof. And you still failed.

Id: [0x0021E345]
Take some time to think about my request.

Id: [0x0021E349]
I'll be here if you reconsider.

Id: [0x0021E34D]
This will be worth your while, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021FB4B]
Changed your mind, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0021FB4C]
Finally ready to do some work?

Id: [0x0021FB4D]
Still got work for you, if you changed your mind.

Id: [0x0021FB4E]
Could still use a hand, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0021FB4F]
Ready to make yourself useful?

Id: [0x0021FB5F]
Glad you jumped in. Could still use your help, though, if you're willing.

Id: [0x0021FB60]
Thanks, <i>misthios</i>. You know, I've been looking for someone with your... skills.

Id: [0x0021FB65]
<i>Misthios</i>. There'd be nothing left of me if you hadn't jumped in. I'd be willing to repay you with some work, if you're interested.

Id: [0x0021FB66]
You've got quite a bit of fight in you, mercenary. You know, I've got work for someone like you.

Id: [0x0021FB6B]
I was counting my coins for the Ferryman before you came, misthios. Could still use your help, though.

Id: [0x0021FB6C]
Thanks for freeing me, mercenary. Hate to say it, but I could use your help again.

Id: [0x0021FC82]
Good. I need it done quick.

Id: [0x0021FC86]
I owe you.

Id: [0x0021FC8A]
You're doing good work.

Id: [0x0021FC91]
Thank the gods.

Id: [0x0021FC95]
Glad to hear it.

Id: [0x0021FC99]
You have my thanks, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021FCA0]
Good. Get it done soon.

Id: [0x0021FCA4]
Glad we met, then.

Id: [0x0021FCA8]
Thanks, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021FCED]
Honest pay for honest work, <i>misthios</i>. Take this.

Id: [0x0021FCEE]
Good work. Here, you've earned this.

Id: [0x0021FCEF]
You've done me a great service, mercenary. Take this as thanks.

Id: [0x0021FCF0]
Take this as thanks, mercenary. You did good work.

Id: [0x0021FCF1]
You earned your pay, mercenary. Take this.

Id: [0x0021FCF2]
You let me down, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021FCF3]
Should've known that getting something done right means doing it yourself.

Id: [0x0021FCF4]
Can't believe I trusted you. And for this!

Id: [0x0021FCF5]
Only a fool could have messed this up.

Id: [0x0021FCF6]
The gods are not favoring me today.

Id: [0x0021FCFD]
Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x0021FD00]
I pay fair wages, you know.

Id: [0x0021FD03]
Think it over, mercenary.

Id: [0x0021FD06]
Reconsider.

Id: [0x0021FD09]
Come back if you find a conscience.

Id: [0x00220218]
[&laughs]I really made a fool of myself this time, didn't I? I'm Sophokles, though I'm sure you knew that. And you are?

Id: [0x0022021E]
These are instructions...

Id: [0x0022021F]
On how to kill me. But they've been torn.

Id: [0x00220220]
Of course I know about the Cult. Here, look at this.

Id: [0x00220221]
So he knows about the plot.

Id: [0x00220222]
<i>Maláka</i>. It isn't the trial that Perikles is saving you from... these are instructions to murder you. Who wrote this?

Id: [0x00220227]
I can.

Id: [0x0022022B]
That's no way to calm down someone who is obviously upset.

Id: [0x0022022C]
No, it's not.

Id: [0x00220640]
Spare me. I'm only looking for clues to help me find a Spartan woman.

Id: [0x00220644]
<i>I </i>am looking for information that'll help me find someone. A Spartan woman.

Id: [0x00220646]
A Spartan woman in Athens? Sounds intriguing, though if you expect me to notice someone other than myself, you expect too much.

Id: [0x00220654]
My master will be pleased.

Id: [0x00220667]
I'll get the records for you.

Id: [0x0022067C]
I'm not sure. All I know is that this particular ship was part of The Dagger's fleet. They keep trying to salvage whatever's down there. If it's important to The Dagger, then it's important to us.

Id: [0x0022067D]
Whatever's in the ship's cargo is of great interest to The Dagger. If you can get it, then maybe my master didn't die for nothing... Meet me down in Eretria when you're done.

Id: [0x0022068C]
How did you get involved in all of this?

Id: [0x00220696]
I guess you're not the hero Agapios thought you were.

Id: [0x00220697]
Come back and see me if you change your mind.

Id: [0x00220699]
Thank you. Is there anything you need to know before leaving?

Id: [0x002206A1]
If you keep staring at me, I'll tell pater!

Id: [0x002206A5]
You don't <i>look </i>like a <i>misthios</i>...

Id: [0x002206AA]
Go home to your father and do as he says - or I'll tell the Minotaur where you live.

Id: [0x002206AB]
But - UGH! I<i> HATE </i>YOU, MISTHIOS!!!

Id: [0x002206B6]
<i>Pater</i> will never find me up here!

Id: [0x002206B9]
What were you doing up there, anyway?

Id: [0x002206BA]
Spitting on things.

Id: [0x002206BB]
Ah. ...Don't.

Id: [0x002206BF]
You're safe. Go home. [beat]And listen to your pater when he calls for you.

Id: [0x002206C0]
Yes miss, sorry miss.

Id: [0x002206CB]
How'd you find me in here?!

Id: [0x002206CC]
...Well, go away.

Id: [0x002206CF]
When's mater home?

Id: [0x002206D0]
<i>SHE</i> LETS ME PLAY IN VASES!

Id: [0x002206D8]
Everything you broke was really expensive. [beat]So my pater will probably kill you.

Id: [0x002206D9]
I'm sure.

Id: [0x002206E1]
Where are those little malákes... Oh! If you want to start the Trial of Accuracy, you'll need to speak to Leiandros in Lato first.

Id: [0x002206E9]
My wife's pregnant again. Please be a girl, please be a girl, please be a girl...

Id: [0x00220831]
It'll be nice to live without fear, but I'm still a slave without a master.

Id: [0x0022083F]
This is why I'm here. It's your symbol, right?

Id: [0x00220844]
You sell javelins?

Id: [0x00220845]
My friend! I still have javelins for you.

Id: [0x0022084B]
Of course! Lucky you, I still have some left. With the Games on, they sell out fast.

Id: [0x0022084C]
But are they any good?

Id: [0x0022084D]
The best! Fly fast and true, rest assured. But they'll cost you.

Id: [0x0022084F]
I'll take one.

Id: [0x00220850]
Thank you, and may it fly far!

Id: [0x00220854]
Sorry, not sure it's what I'm looking for.

Id: [0x00220855]
Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002208C6]
Aspasia, there's a plague. You've seen the streets - she's just a child.

Id: [0x002208C7]
Give her the credit she deserves - she's more of a fighter than I was at her age.

Id: [0x002208C9]
It's true. But Phoibe's smart. She knows the way back.

Id: [0x002208CA]
I hope so.

Id: [0x002208DB]
Are you able to help me now, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x002208DC]
I could still use your help, you know.

Id: [0x002208DD]
Tell me you've changed your mind.

Id: [0x002208DE]
Please tell me you've reconsidered.

Id: [0x002208DF]
Do you have time to help me now, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x002208EF]
By the gods, I'm glad you stepped in, mercenary. Now that you're here, maybe there's something else you can help me with...

Id: [0x002208F0]
I owe you my life, mercenary. But I'm afraid there's still more I must ask of you.

Id: [0x002208F1]
I'm alive because of you, mercenary. And now that we've met, there's something else I could use your skills for.

Id: [0x002208F5]
I owe you more than words can say, mercenary. But maybe I can repay you with some work.

Id: [0x002208FB]
I never thought I'd get out of here. But now that I'm free, I need your help, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002208FC]
The gods were smiling on me when they sent you. You have my thanks. Though I could use your talents again, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00220A12]
By the gods, thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00220A16]
This will be worth your while, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00220A1A]
You're a gods-send.

Id: [0x00220A21]
Thank the gods!

Id: [0x00220A25]
Good, please be quick.

Id: [0x00220A29]
You truly are sent by the gods.

Id: [0x00220A30]
By Zeus, thank you!

Id: [0x00220A34]
I can rest my mind, then.

Id: [0x00220A38]
I'm in your debt.

Id: [0x00220A7D]
I owe more than words can say. But please, take this.

Id: [0x00220A7E]
You've earned your payment, <i>misthios</i>. Here. This is for you.

Id: [0x00220A7F]
You do good work, <i>misthios</i>. Take this for your trouble.

Id: [0x00220A80]
I'm glad I put my faith in you, <i>misthios</i>. Please take this.

Id: [0x00220A81]
You're truly skilled, <i>misthios</i>. Here. For you.

Id: [0x00220A82]
I know it wasn't an easy task, but this?

Id: [0x00220A83]
I just don't understand how this could have happened.

Id: [0x00220A84]
How could you let this happen?

Id: [0x00220A85]
This is a mess.

Id: [0x00220A86]
How could you fail me?

Id: [0x00220A8D]
What will I do now?

Id: [0x00220A90]
Please reconsider!

Id: [0x00220A93]
I'll be here if you change your mind.

Id: [0x00220FA5]
I'm going to look for her. Where is Anastasios's house?

Id: [0x00220FA6]
It's across from the Odeon of Perikles.

Id: [0x00220FA7]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00220FB8]
Are you able to help me after all?

Id: [0x00220FB9]
I hope you've reconsidered.

Id: [0x00220FBA]
Are you ready to help?

Id: [0x00220FBB]
My offer still stands, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00220FBC]
Have you reconsidered?

Id: [0x00220FCC]
Thank the gods you were here, <i>misthios</i>. Though there's something else I could use your help with.

Id: [0x00220FCD]
They'll tell stories of your bravery, <i>misthios</i>. And I have just the task for someone of your strength.

Id: [0x00220FCE]
Clearly the gods sent such a brave warrior to save me! And that's not all I need your help with.

Id: [0x00220FD2]
You possess the strength of Herakles himself, mercenary! And I have just the labor to prove your skill, if you're interested.

Id: [0x00220FD8]
I can't think of what might have happened if you hadn't come, <i>misthios</i>. But now that I'm free, I need your help.

Id: [0x00220FD9]
Thank the gods you came. I never thought I'd be free. Now that I am, I could use your help with something.

Id: [0x002210EF]
Thank the muses.

Id: [0x002210F3]
By Zeus, thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002210F7]
The glory will be yours, mercenary.

Id: [0x002210FE]
They'll tell tales of this, mercenary.

Id: [0x00221102]
You're a true hero.

Id: [0x00221106]
By Apollo, thank you.

Id: [0x0022110D]
You're truly brave, mercenary.

Id: [0x00221111]
You're saving me.

Id: [0x00221115]
Please be careful.

Id: [0x0022115A]
By Apollo, thank you. This is for you.

Id: [0x0022115B]
So you are as brave as you look. Please, take this as thanks.

Id: [0x0022115C]
The gods favored me the day we met. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022115D]
You're truly a great warrior. Please take this as thanks.

Id: [0x0022115E]
The gods were smiling on me the day we met. Thank you. Please, for your trouble.

Id: [0x0022115F]
I knew this would be hard, but I did not foresee this.

Id: [0x00221160]
How could you let me down like this?

Id: [0x00221161]
I did not expect you to fail me.

Id: [0x00221162]
I can't believe I trusted you.

Id: [0x00221163]
Maybe it was the furies and not the muses who sent you to me, after all.

Id: [0x0022116A]
I'll be here if you change your mind.

Id: [0x0022116D]
Won't someone help me?

Id: [0x00221170]
The Fates are not smiling on me, it seems.

Id: [0x00221692]
Changed your mind, mercenary?

Id: [0x00221693]
Come to help me after all, mercenary?

Id: [0x00221694]
I could still use you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00221695]
There's still a job for you here, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00221696]
You again. Ready to help?

Id: [0x002216A6]
Ha, you're a strong one! There's actually something else I could use your help with, if you're willing.

Id: [0x002216A7]
Aren't you skilled? You know, I might have a job for you.

Id: [0x002216A8]
Thanks for jumping in! I could really use someone of your... talents.

Id: [0x002216AC]
Thanks for the help, mercenary. I have a job for someone with your skills, if you're interested.

Id: [0x002216B2]
I owe you my life, <i>misthios</i>​. But I'm afraid I must call on your help again.

Id: [0x002216B3]
I never thought I'd get out of there. You have my thanks... But I could still use your help.

Id: [0x002217C9]
Good, get this done quickly.

Id: [0x002217CD]
Braver than you look. Good luck.

Id: [0x002217D1]
May the gods go with you.

Id: [0x002217D8]
By Apollo, thank you.

Id: [0x002217DC]
I owe you, mercenary.

Id: [0x002217E0]
Ha! You really are a brave one.

Id: [0x002217E7]
You've saved me, mercenary.

Id: [0x002217EB]
Please, get this done quickly.

Id: [0x002217EF]
I owe you one.

Id: [0x00221834]
Payment well earned, mercenary. Take this as thanks.

Id: [0x00221835]
You do good work, friend. Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x00221836]
Ha! You're a true warrior. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x00221837]
Job well done, mercenary. Here, this is yours.

Id: [0x00221838]
Then I believe this is yours. You have my thanks, friend.

Id: [0x00221839]
By Zeus, how could this happen?

Id: [0x0022183A]
Maybe you were sent to me not as a blessing, but as a trial.

Id: [0x0022183B]
How could you fail? I should have done this myself.

Id: [0x0022183C]
How could I be so foolish as to trust you?

Id: [0x0022183D]
I can't believe you failed me, mercenary.

Id: [0x00221844]
Think it over, mercenary.

Id: [0x00221847]
When you change your mind, I'll be here.

Id: [0x0022184A]
<i>Misthios</i>... please reconsider.

Id: [0x00222437]
Phoibe will be fine. She knows the city well.

Id: [0x00222B59]
We are Athenians. We settle our disputes democratically, but there comes a time when words are not enough, and the people must take action.

Id: [0x00222B5B]
Raise your voices! I promise you, you won't be ignored any longer.

Id: [0x00222B5C]
Eagle Bearer... I heard you have a fearsome ship with a crew to match. Maybe you'd consider helping Sparta put a dent in the Athenian navy?

Id: [0x00222B5D]
I'd make yourself scarce, Spartan. Seems like a battle's brewing, and I doubt the Athenians would think twice about cutting you down.

Id: [0x00222B5E]
I can't recruit the most fearless captains in the Greek world without a little risk, Eagle Bearer... Maybe you'd consider sailing with Sparta today?

Id: [0x00222B64]
Eagle Bearer. Sparta is attacking Athenian ships... Maybe you'll consider sailing with my forces to glory?

Id: [0x00222B65]
My offer still stands, Eagle Bearer, if you'd like to sail with the winning side.

Id: [0x00222B66]
You're back. Maybe you've thought some more about my offer?

Id: [0x00222C16]
Hey you, <i>misthios</i>! Would you like to learn about your future?

Id: [0x00222C18]
Kassandra... You're back! Gotta run, sorry.

Id: [0x00222C2C]
Thank you. I would like to know what the Fates have planned for me.

Id: [0x00222C2F]
Wait! Where...

Id: [0x00222C31]
I'll be right back. See you at Aspasia's!

Id: [0x00222C33]
Sometimes I think you are too much like me.

Id: [0x00222C66]
No worries! How's about I clean your sandals?

Id: [0x00222C67]
The Oracle at Delphi ruined my life. You think I want to hear your lies, too?

Id: [0x00222C90]
Have you thought any more about my offer, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00222C91]
Sparta has my ship and my crew.

Id: [0x00222C92]
Let's show those filthy Athenians the wrath of Poseidon.

Id: [0x00222C9C]
Not today.

Id: [0x00222C9E]
My sandals are fine.

Id: [0x00222CB0]
I don't need anything. Go!

Id: [0x00222CB1]
Well, no accounting for taste, but suit yourself!

Id: [0x00222CB5]
Then what about your...

Id: [0x00222CC4]
I'm looking for the one called Kyra.

Id: [0x00222CC8]
I've come in response to a call for help.

Id: [0x00222CD0]
Are you here to spy, Athenian? Or maybe you are Athena herself, dressed in a dirty disguise?

Id: [0x00222CDF]
My crew and I will sail alongside you.

Id: [0x00222CE0]
Good. Let's send the Athenians to their watery graves.

Id: [0x00222CE3]
<i>Maláka</i>, my drachmae! Hey, stop, thief!

Id: [0x00222CE6]
Looks like Phoibe... And as nimble a thief!

Id: [0x00222CE8]
What is with the Olympics? Everyone's out to make drachmae...

Id: [0x00222CE9]
You have my crew.

Id: [0x00222CEA]
Let's match Poseidon's wrath with our own.

Id: [0x00222CEB]
My crew and I aren't interested in warfare today.

Id: [0x00222CEC]
My offer stands until we set sail, so come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x00222CF9]
Now, where would Phoibe go if she'd stolen a purse?

Id: [0x00222D04]
I have to find her.

Id: [0x00222D09]
A street thief. Just like Phoibe...

Id: [0x00222D10]
I have work to do.

Id: [0x00222D18]
I need to find Aspasia and get out of this crazy city as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00222D1B]
Come back if you change your mind before we set sail. Sparta pays better than those <i>malákes</i> Athenians.

Id: [0x00222D1C]
I don't have time for this right now.

Id: [0x00222D1D]
Come back if you change your mind. We need every ready ship, so my offer will stand until we set sail.

Id: [0x00222D27]
Why do I feed those little shits? Let 'em steal their own food.

Id: [0x00222D28]
You want me to give them your food? Maybe I should beat you more, set an example for the brats.

Id: [0x00222D2A]
Well, Captain, if you don't feed them, they'll be too weak to run away with the loot. If they get caught, you'll have to train new ones.

Id: [0x00222D2B]
I've no time now, can't you see what's happening?

Id: [0x00222D35]
There's that <i>maláka</i> I saw in the market. He must be in on this scheme.

Id: [0x00222D41]
Keeping children in cages? Whoever did this will pay.

Id: [0x00222D58]
You! Get the fuck out of my camp before I beat you like the dog that you are.

Id: [0x00222D5F]
Kassandra, I didn't think you'd come here after calling my plan a suicide mission.

Id: [0x00222D62]
You think this is a game? You're supposed to bring me <i>drachmae</i>, not excuses!

Id: [0x00222D66]
So that's what all this is? Some kind of plan?

Id: [0x00222D68]
I expect you'll find the proof you need of his offenses.

Id: [0x00222D6E]
You're back! The Athenian navy surrounds these islands. Are you crazy enough to confront their ships?

Id: [0x00222D79]
Your men are brave, but they won't be enough. We need those reinforcements.

Id: [0x00222D7D]
If I was under your command, what would you order me to do?

Id: [0x00222D7E]
Same thing I order my men. Bruised, bloody, or broken, never hold back.

Id: [0x00222D88]
I never hold back.

Id: [0x00222D89]
I can tell.

Id: [0x00222D8C]
You act tough. But I'm sure there's a softer side to you.

Id: [0x00222D8D]
That's why Spartans carry shields.

Id: [0x00222D90]
Bruised, bloody, or broken? That can be arranged.

Id: [0x00222D9C]
The sea's a big place. Where did your ship sink exactly?

Id: [0x00222D9D]
Somewhere off the northern coast of Mykonos. We could see Miltiades Fort as we swam to shore.

Id: [0x00222DA2]
You've been here long enough - how many ships protect Delos?

Id: [0x00222DA3]
You’ll never sink them all. We just need to punch a hole in their patrols, enough to send them scrambling.

Id: [0x00222DA5]
The sharks will have full bellies when I’m done.

Id: [0x00222DA8]
Definitely.

Id: [0x00222DA9]
And what if Kleon believes killing a thousand will save a million? Is that a good act? What defines his actions as good? For that matter, what defines yours?

Id: [0x00222DAA]
I guess not.

Id: [0x00222DAB]
But if you're not willing to work for the greater good, then what is the defining factor?

Id: [0x00222DAD]
Convince how?

Id: [0x00222DAE]
With evidence. With truth, as you say.

Id: [0x00222DB0]
Good. I'm headed soon to speak in front of the people at the Pnyx. If you find anything that can help, meet me there.

Id: [0x00222DF7]
There's more. I have your helmet right here. Take it.

Id: [0x00222DF8]
It saved me more times than I can count. Thank you.

Id: [0x00222E00]
The Athenian navy is scrambling.

Id: [0x00222E04]
The Athenians are organized. That makes them deadly. We kill the commanders, and we have a chance to win this battle.

Id: [0x00222E16]
I never thought Poseidon's anger would be too much for the mighty Kassandra's stomach.

Id: [0x00222E18]
That storm was more than just anger, Barnabas. That was personal.

Id: [0x00222E21]
Don't thank me yet. Your father's helmet is gone.

Id: [0x00222E22]
I... can't even remember his face anymore. That helmet was all I had left of him. But, you broke the navy. That will be my vengeance.

Id: [0x00222E39]
You have heart, but your troops are your family now. The Athenians will want to kill all of us for what I've done.

Id: [0x00222E3A]
If that's the plan, we attack their commanders. Athenians are sheep. Kill the shepherd, and the flock will flee.

Id: [0x00222E64]
I want names, Thaletas.

Id: [0x00222E65]
Tisandros commands the Athenian elite guard. Polemion is their strategist. And the last, a general named Neokles, is missing.

Id: [0x00222E67]
When the commanders are dead, and more Spartans arrive, there will be plenty of blood for both of us.

Id: [0x00222E78]
That's a bold move.

Id: [0x00222E7A]
Desperate times.

Id: [0x00222E7B]
So, other methods are in play. A student of mine poses as a guard at the akropolis as we speak. It's an unusual method, but these are desperate times.

Id: [0x00222E7C]
Then they call for desperate measures.

Id: [0x00222E89]
Maláka...

Id: [0x00222E9C]
Yes, you're right.

Id: [0x00222EA4]
For the ferryman.

Id: [0x00222EA6]
Go now, into the river of black night, and embrace the boundless gloom. You shall wander obscure even in the house of Hades, flitting among the shadowy dead.

Id: [0x00222EB4]
This? This is nothing.

Id: [0x00222EC1]
What do you think you're doing? You're driving this mob to madness.

Id: [0x00222EC2]
Democracy, my young friend. Maybe now you're beginning to see the bigger picture. A shame it's a little too late.

Id: [0x00222ECD]
I will make Athens great again!

Id: [0x00222ECF]
What's going on?

Id: [0x00222EDE]
Kleon, what's going on?

Id: [0x00222EE0]
I'm glad you could see this. You helped lay the groundwork.

Id: [0x00222FA4]
No!

Id: [0x00222FA5]
A small part, but a part, nonetheless. I hope after everything has unfolded that I will be able to reward you properly.

Id: [0x00222FA7]
My people are waiting.

Id: [0x00222FA8]
Is it wrong to blame one man? Not if it's Perikles, the man who brought our once-great city to this!

Id: [0x00222FAA]
But I promise you, I will return Athens to greatness.

Id: [0x002230D3]
And? Is it done?

Id: [0x00223162]
<i>Chaire</i>. Anything you need a mercenary's help with?

Id: [0x00223174]
<i>Chaire</i>. Is there something you need?

Id: [0x00223181]
<i>Chaire</i>. Can I help you with anything?

Id: [0x00223186]
Can I help you with something?

Id: [0x00223223]
I take that as a compliment.

Id: [0x00223224]
You haven't asked me about the commanders.

Id: [0x00223238]
Careful. You never know what I'll ask for.

Id: [0x00223239]
Ha! Try me.

Id: [0x002232AD]
We may die tomorrow. If I could ask for anything, I'd ask for tonight... with you.

Id: [0x002232B1]
I would ask for Kyra.

Id: [0x002232B2]
Kassandra, I... Maybe we should focus on the war.

Id: [0x002232B4]
I'd ask for you, Thaletas. Now and forever by my side.

Id: [0x002232C2]
<i>Chaire</i>, <i>misthios</i>. If you've got a boat and a ready crew, we'll pay you well to defend our waters against the Athenian scum.

Id: [0x002232C3]
Those god-fucking Athenians are infesting our waters, and we need boats to clear them out. If you've got a ready crew, we'll pay well for your help.

Id: [0x002232C4]
Chaire. I don't suppose you have a battle-ready boat and crew?

Id: [0x002232C5]
I do - one of the finest at sea.

Id: [0x002232C6]
Then maybe you'll consider sailing under Spartan colors to drive those filthy Athenians out. [beat]For a fair wage, of course.

Id: [0x002232C8]
The mighty Eagle Bearer. Did I hear correctly that you command one of the deadliest ships at sea?

Id: [0x002232C9]
You did.

Id: [0x002232CA]
Then maybe you'd like to turn it against those wretched Athenians? They're attacking our navy.

Id: [0x00223349]
The Fates are working in my favor.

Id: [0x0022334D]
What a relief.

Id: [0x00223351]
I owe you, friend.

Id: [0x00223371]
Eagle Bearer... One of the fiercest commanders at sea, I've heard. Any truth to that rumor?

Id: [0x00223372]
Depends why you're asking.

Id: [0x00223373]
The Athenians are planning an attack on our navy. If you were to join in our defense, Poseidon's wrath would be the least of their worries.

Id: [0x00223374]
Ah, the mighty warrior with the broken spear. Maybe Zeus is smiling on us after all.

Id: [0x00223380]
By the gods, thank you.

Id: [0x00223384]
It's time someone showed me mercy.

Id: [0x00223388]
I'm putting my trust in you, mercenary.

Id: [0x0022338F]
Please be quick.

Id: [0x00223393]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223397]
By Zeus, thank you.

Id: [0x0022339E]
You've saved me, mercenary.

Id: [0x002233A2]
I owe you a great deal.

Id: [0x002233A6]
Thank the gods.

Id: [0x002233A8]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002233A9]
The Athenians are attacking our navy. But with you on our side, we'd be unstoppable.

Id: [0x002233B7]
After all you've done? Of course I'll join you.

Id: [0x002233BB]
I can hardly believe someone like you wants to travel with me. I'm in.

Id: [0x002233C2]
When do we set out?

Id: [0x002233C6]
I'll be worthy of your crew, I promise.

Id: [0x002233CA]
Traveling the Aegean has always been my dream. The chance to do it with you? Even better.

Id: [0x002233D1]
Wherever we end up can't be worse than here.

Id: [0x002233D5]
Let's set sail, commander.

Id: [0x002233D9]
I've always known there was a better life for me than this. Let's go.

Id: [0x002233DB]
You're back. Thought any more about my offer?

Id: [0x002233DC]
You again. Are you ready to prove your sea legs?

Id: [0x002233DD]
We meet again. [beat]Have you changed your mind about joining Sparta?

Id: [0x002233EB]
This place doesn't offer me much, but it is my home. I can't leave.

Id: [0x002233EF]
May not look like it, but there are people who depend on me here.

Id: [0x002233F6]
Much as I'd like to join you, I'm bound to this place, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002233FA]
You know I can't leave, mercenary. Though I'd like to.

Id: [0x002233FE]
This place is all I've ever known. I can't just leave that behind.

Id: [0x00223405]
This place might be a shithole, but it's still my home, mercenary. I can't leave.

Id: [0x00223409]
I've put down roots here, <i>misthios</i>. I can't join you.

Id: [0x0022340D]
You've done a great deal, mercenary, but I'm afraid I can't leave my life here for you.

Id: [0x0022341C]
It's not much, but please, take this as thanks.

Id: [0x00223427]
What's mine is yours. Please.

Id: [0x0022342E]
It's not much, but here. For your trouble.

Id: [0x00223434]
I'll do it.

Id: [0x00223435]
We'll make the Athenians regret ever setting foot on a boat.

Id: [0x00223436]
My crew is prepared for anything. Say the word, and we'll set sail.

Id: [0x00223437]
Let's send those bloody Athenians to the seafloor.

Id: [0x00223438]
My crew and my ship are yours.

Id: [0x00223439]
Glad to hear it! Time to send the Athenians to their watery graves.

Id: [0x00223469]
My crew and I are busy.

Id: [0x0022346A]
If you change your mind before we set sail, come see me.

Id: [0x0022346B]
My crew and I have other work to do.

Id: [0x0022346C]
Take some time and think it over - we pay handsomely. Just come and see me before we set sail.

Id: [0x0022346D]
My crew and I aren't looking to fight today.

Id: [0x0022346E]
If you find a spine before we set sail, come find me. We'll need all the boats we can get.

Id: [0x0022347B]
<i>Chaire</i>, priestess. Anything I can help you with?

Id: [0x00223480]
What can I do to serve the gods today, priestess?

Id: [0x00223485]
Can I be of service, priestess?

Id: [0x0022348D]
Anything a mercenary can do for you today, healer?

Id: [0x00223492]
<i>Chaire</i>, healer. Need any help?

Id: [0x00223497]
Need something, healer?

Id: [0x0022349F]
<i>Chaire</i>, stranger. Anything you need help with?

Id: [0x002234A4]
Anything a mercenary can do for you today, stranger?

Id: [0x002234A9]
<i>Chaire</i>, stranger. Need anything from a mercenary?

Id: [0x00223536]
An opportunity to study herbs all over the Greek world. I'm in.

Id: [0x0022353A]
I could certainly help more people if I traveled. [beat]I'm in.

Id: [0x0022353E]
All right. I suppose if there are people who need healing where you're headed, I'll find work.

Id: [0x00223545]
I'm impressed. Not many would be brave enough to invite me aboard their ship. I'll join you.

Id: [0x00223549]
Most try to avoid dark magic, but you're inviting it aboard. I can't wait to see where this... partnership leads.

Id: [0x0022354D]
I don't get many invitations to sail. I accept.

Id: [0x00223567]
I appreciate the offer, <i>misthios</i>, but I'll have a great deal of trouble collecting herbs by sea.

Id: [0x0022356B]
My work is on land, <i>misthios</i>. Where the plants are.

Id: [0x0022356F]
There are too many people who need healing on land for me to join you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223576]
Ha! You've done me a favor, <i>misthios</i>. Now let me return it. I won't bring my dark magic aboard your ship.

Id: [0x0022357A]
I can't sail with someone so foolish they'd invite a witch aboard their ship.

Id: [0x0022357E]
I've cursed enough boats to know I'm safer with both feet planted on the ground.

Id: [0x00223585]

Id: [0x0022369E]
Misthios. I decided to stay and rebuild my life, and Eretria with it. Without you [beat]I never would've had the opportunity.

Id: [0x00223705]
I never saw myself as a sailor, but [beat]life on the open sea is certainly preferable to death. I'm in.

Id: [0x00223709]
I was thinking something more... short term. But if that's what it takes to avoid death, [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x0022376C]
Debris from The Dagger's sunken ship.

Id: [0x00223796]
<i>Misthios</i>! Up here. Please don't make me shout!

Id: [0x002237A4]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002237A8]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x002237AC]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x002237B3]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x002237B7]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x002237BA]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x002237BE]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x002237C2]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x002237C6]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x002237CA]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002237CF]
<i>Chaire,</i> commander. What can I do to serve Sparta?

Id: [0x002237D9]
Doing recon on the Athenians, I take it. Anything a mercenary can help with, spy?

Id: [0x002237DE]
Spying on these Athenians is no easy task, Spartan. Anything I can do to help?

Id: [0x002237E3]
You're a long way from Sparta, spy. Anything a mercenary can do for you today?

Id: [0x002237EB]
You're braver than you look!

Id: [0x002237EF]
Good! The gods are smiling on me.

Id: [0x002237F3]
Well met! Sparta thanks you.

Id: [0x002237F7]
Thank you. This must be done carefully.

Id: [0x002237FB]
Please, get it done.

Id: [0x002237FF]
Good. Please be quick.

Id: [0x00223809]
I never thought I'd be a Spartan deserter... But then I never thought I'd stop wanting to be Spartan. I'm in.

Id: [0x0022380D]
I knew this post wouldn't be easy, but lately it's been... unbearable. I'll join you.

Id: [0x00223811]
I'm ashamed to even think it but... the life of a Spartan commander has been straining. [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x00223815]
Not many would travel with a spy, but I could gather far more intel with more mobility. I'm in.

Id: [0x00223819]
You'd trust a spy on your ship? You're either foolish or brave. I'd like to find out.

Id: [0x0022381D]
I could gather more intel traveling the Aegean with you than if I stayed here. All right, I'm in.

Id: [0x00223827]
What do you take me for, an Athenian? I can't leave my post.

Id: [0x0022382B]
How could you think a Spartan commander would even consider deserting his post to sail with you?

Id: [0x0022382F]
Spartan commanders don't abandon their posts, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223833]
Even spies have honor. Mine is pledged to Sparta, and Sparta needs me here.

Id: [0x00223837]
I appreciate the offer, but the intelligence Sparta needs is here.

Id: [0x0022383B]
May not look like it, but there's much afoot here that Sparta must watch. I can't join you.

Id: [0x00223884]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223888]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x0022388C]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x00223890]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x00223894]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x002238C6]
They don't <i>deserve </i>a chance. For Euboea to survive, corruption and those who spread it <i>must </i>be crushed. I'll wait for you here.

Id: [0x002238CC]
That's all three tokens. Better meet Leiandros at the Warrior's Rest.

Id: [0x002238D1]
I need all of the Trial Tokens.

Id: [0x00223C7C]
You're back. Have you killed them?

Id: [0x00223C80]
You again. Have you killed him?

Id: [0x00223C84]
You. Have you killed her?

Id: [0x00223C88]
<i>Misthios</i>! Has the beast been slain?

Id: [0x00223C8E]
Were you able to free him?

Id: [0x00223C92]
You're back. Were you able to free her?

Id: [0x00223C9E]
<i>Misthios</i>! Were you able to keep him safe?

Id: [0x00223CA2]
Were you able to protect her?

Id: [0x00223CAD]
Has he been... dealt with, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00223CB1]
Has she been... taken care of, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00223CB7]
Back already. Did you destroy them all?

Id: [0x00223CBB]
You again. Has it been destroyed, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00223CC3]
Did you get it?

Id: [0x00223CCB]
Have you done what I asked?

Id: [0x00223CCD]
Tell me it's been handled, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223CCF]
I trust you were successful?

Id: [0x00223CD1]
Do you bring me good news, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00223CD3]
You're back. Finished already?

Id: [0x00223D15]
Please, accept this as thanks.

Id: [0x00223D19]
Then this belongs to you. Nice work, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223D1D]
Great work. Take this as thanks, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223D21]
Job well done, <i>misthios</i>. This is for you.

Id: [0x00223D25]
Good work, <i>misthios</i>. Please, take this.

Id: [0x00223D29]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00223D2D]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x00223D31]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x00223D35]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x00223D39]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x00223DEF]
<i>Misthios</i>! I have a job for you.

Id: [0x00223DF8]
Your wife sent me to find you.

Id: [0x00223DF9]
Praise Poseidon. The pirates were waiting for high tide to attack.

Id: [0x00223DFA]
We need to leave now. I'll escort you back to Heraklion.

Id: [0x00223DFB]
I'm right behind you.

Id: [0x00223E01]
It's down this way!

Id: [0x00223E02]
This place is going to blow your mind, misthios. There's a <i>hugeeeeee</i> room and there's a <i>hugeeeeee</i> hole in the ground with a <i>hugeeeeee</i> door.

Id: [0x00223E03]
Everybody keeps going on about how -

Id: [0x00223E04]
<i>Theseus </i>killed the Minotaur.

Id: [0x00223E05]
Lies! I heard it! A roar, like - like uh -

Id: [0x00223E06]
Rolling thunder!

Id: [0x00223E08]
Yeah, that's it.

Id: [0x00223E09]
The Minotaur is still alive! And hungry!

Id: [0x00223E0A]
Great.

Id: [0x00223E0B]
I'm glad you came along. Now pater has a shot of getting out of that damn labyrinth.

Id: [0x00223E0C]
They really didn't have to put the entrance this deep. Almost there. What were these Minoans thinking?

Id: [0x00223E12]
What are you doing? Come back, misthios!

Id: [0x00223E17]
Here we are!

Id: [0x00223E22]
I'm still paying "fees" to Swordfish. Hurry up and find his underwater hideout.

Id: [0x00223E28]
You're identical twins?! Don't move, or I'll cut you both down!

Id: [0x00223E29]
Thank the Fates! They were going to kill me and blame it on you! Strike Diona down!

Id: [0x00223E2A]
<i>She's</i> Diona! Her jealousy and bitterness have driven her to work with the Cult. My own sister!

Id: [0x00223E2B]
This is madness! <i>She's</i> Diona! And she's conspired with the Cult to usurp my position as High Priestess.

Id: [0x00223E2C]
Don't be deceived, <i>misthios</i>! They've set this final trap to fool you!

Id: [0x00223E30]
We should leave! Diona's guards might come after us.

Id: [0x00223E36]
...I'm sorry I stole the disk -

Id: [0x00223E37]
I understand -

Id: [0x00223E38]
And your amulet.

Id: [0x00223E39]
What amulet?

Id: [0x00223E3A]
And your ring collection.

Id: [0x00223E3B]
So that's where -

Id: [0x00223E3C]
And your memoirs.

Id: [0x00223E3D]
I hadn't finished those!

Id: [0x00223E3E]
By the gods - you can't be stealing things all the time, Ardos!

Id: [0x00223E3F]
But I'm <i>good </i>at it! And I only steal from people who deserve it.

Id: [0x00223E40]
I didn't deserve it.

Id: [0x00223E41]
You didn't talk to me for years.

Id: [0x00223E42]
Well, I -

Id: [0x00223E43]
You're right. I wasn't there for you. Perhaps I did deserve it.

Id: [0x00223E44]
I know, right?! Not to mention all the gold -

Id: [0x00223E45]
WHAT?! Ardos -

Id: [0x00223E47]
...You didn't steal anything from the <i>misthios</i>, did you?

Id: [0x00223E48]
Ha! We'll never know.

Id: [0x00223E4D]
Look at you, a finely-tuned instrument of justice. Help us destroy this vile woman!

Id: [0x00223E52]
They worship the Writhing Dread. Kill them before they call its wrath upon us!

Id: [0x00223E5C]
By Iris! It's Chios island.

Id: [0x00223E62]
Our lives are like the rising and setting of the sun.

Id: [0x00223E69]
<i>Misthios</i>! Can I interest you in some lumber for your ship?

Id: [0x00223E70]
Drachmae for the person who escorts my ship back safely!

Id: [0x00223E72]
Save my ship from the pirates, and I'll make it worth your while.

Id: [0x00223E79]
We need to get back to Skandeia before the pirates return!

Id: [0x00223E7F]
Oh, a real adventurer! Please, help!

Id: [0x00223E81]
Please, <i>misthios</i>! It's my idiot husband!

Id: [0x00223E90]
I hope you're here to buy fish and not just hang about.

Id: [0x00223E95]
Please, accept this drachmae as thanks. I tried to trade it for my freedom, but those crazy <i>malákes</i> only wanted my blood.

Id: [0x00223E9A]
Octopus Bay! Try Octopus Bay, it's full of the cursed things.

Id: [0x00223E9E]
Thank you. [beat]I'll probably change the name, though.

Id: [0x00223EA1]
We all have our niche, I guess.

Id: [0x00223EB3]
Seems like a lot of hassle for a Token...

Id: [0x00223EB5]
Looks like I'll have to get wet.

Id: [0x00223EB9]
Home. <i>NOW.</i>

Id: [0x00224391]
Agreed. We need to get to my ship.

Id: [0x00224395]
Our troops will be ready for battle.

Id: [0x002243C0]
Not Spartan. Just deadly.

Id: [0x002243C4]
Ah, Kyra told me that name. They call me Thaletas. I was polemarch to the Spartans here.

Id: [0x002243C6]
You fight well. Spartan?

Id: [0x002243CB]
You're bleeding. A lot.

Id: [0x002243CC]
Come to turn me in to the priests?

Id: [0x002243CD]
You're alive. [&gasp]And the monster?[&gasp]

Id: [0x002243CF]
I told Perikles the Cult is in Athens. It's too dangerous.

Id: [0x002243D0]
The Cult? I thought it was the sickness talking.

Id: [0x002243FB]
We must choose our moment wisely and speak our words more privately.

Id: [0x002243FC]
Fine.

Id: [0x002243FD]
We've come to you on... urgent business.

Id: [0x0022440A]
Did Perikles tell you what I said about the Cult in Athens?

Id: [0x00224413]
Serving you is an honor for any true man of the sea. I'm in.

Id: [0x00224417]
I'd be honored to serve on your crew.

Id: [0x0022441B]
I always wanted to set sail, but it seemed like the gods set me on a different path. Now might finally be my chance to see the world.

Id: [0x0022441F]
Traveling the Aegean with you after all you've done for me? I'm in.

Id: [0x00224431]
I've traded my sea legs for a quiet life on the docks, <i>misthios</i>. That's close enough to the sea for me.

Id: [0x00224435]
Ha! I've sailed enough to fear Poseidon's wrath. I'll be spending the rest of my days on land, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00224439]
My life is here, <i>misthios</i>. Everything I know... I can't just leave that behind.

Id: [0x0022443D]
The open sea appeals to many, but not to me, <i>misthios</i>. I prefer working in my forge... with both my feet on land.

Id: [0x00224487]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022448B]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x0022448F]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x00224493]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x00224497]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x002247CB]
Greetings, mercenary. Looking to make some drachmae?

Id: [0x002247CC]
Depends on the job.

Id: [0x002247CD]
Spartan dogs are attacking our position. It's time we sent them home with their tails between their legs, but we need a few more swords. Interested in joining us on the battlefield?

Id: [0x002247F3]
I've never been the type to put down roots. Let's set sail, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002247F7]
An opportunity to sell my wares across ports all over the Aegean? When we do we set sail?

Id: [0x00224821]
The confines of a ship don't appeal to me, <i>misthios</i>. I prefer the open road.

Id: [0x00224825]
You've done a lot for me, <i>misthios</i>, but I prefer traveling when and where I please.

Id: [0x00224841]
<i>Chaire</i>. Spartans are pushing on our borders and we'll need all the iron we can get to send them home on their shields. Will you prove your mettle on the battlefield, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00224842]
Mercenary. Filthy Spartans are trying to break through our defenses, and it's critical we strengthen our hold on these lands. Will you join us?

Id: [0x00224881]
You look like you can handle a blade well enough. We're making a decisive push on Spartan borders and we need all the help we can get, including yours.

Id: [0x00224883]
This Cult! I thought it was his sickness speaking for him.

Id: [0x00224A16]
Read me the note again.

Id: [0x00224A19]
"Eagle-bearing <i>misthios." </i>[beat]That's you.

Id: [0x00224A1A]
Podarkes is one of them, Barnabas. The ones hunting my family. [beat]Keep reading.

Id: [0x00224A22]
What's gotten into you?

Id: [0x00224B79]
Huh, seems Kleon's messenger wasn't the only one captured. Maybe I can help them, too.

Id: [0x00224C98]
Ah, just in time, <i>misthios</i>! We're about to attack Spartan borders and we're looking for every ready sword to send those dogs to Hades. Will you share in our victory?

Id: [0x00224CA3]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00224CA7]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x00224CAB]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x00224CAF]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x00224CB3]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x00224D64]
Phoibe is dead. She's [&cry]dead[/&cry] because you sent her to do your work.

Id: [0x00224D65]
No, I... it's not true. Phoibe wanted to go. She told me she would be all right.

Id: [0x00224D66]
And you believed a child.

Id: [0x00224D67]
You know Phoibe - she wouldn't have taken no for an answer. It was out of my hands.

Id: [0x00224D68]
Phoibe was killed. By Cult guards. Before I could get to her.

Id: [0x00224D98]
Meeting you has changed my life, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00224DA2]
Misthios! If it's drachmae you seek, join us in our coming battle to conquer Spartan borders.

Id: [0x00224DC1]
If you're paying, I'll hunt and kill this beast for you.

Id: [0x00224DC2]
You're not the first hunter to tell me that... [&breath]But I still have all my drachmae.

Id: [0x00224DC3]
Let Artemis hunt the beast.

Id: [0x00224DD0]
This place seems... nice.

Id: [0x00224DF3]
Oh, no. Dear Phoibe.

Id: [0x00224DF5]
She died alone in the street.

Id: [0x00224DF7]
Eagle Bearer! Maybe Athena walks with us after all if you're here.

Id: [0x00224DF8]
What's going on?

Id: [0x00224DF9]
Those shit-eating Spartans have us pinned down here. We could use someone with your skills in the coming battle.

Id: [0x00224DFA]
Your presence is a good omen, Eagle Bearer. It means Zeus is on our side.

Id: [0x00224DFB]
Only Zeus is on Zeus's side.

Id: [0x00224DFC]
We could certainly use your sword in battle. Will you help us send these Spartans home on their shields?

Id: [0x00224DFD]
Eagle Bearer! You're just in time. Spartan dogs are staging an assault on our forces. Interested in raising your shield for Athens today?

Id: [0x00224DFE]
Ah, the mighty warrior with the broken spear. Maybe you'd like to join us in decimating those filthy Spartans' front lines?

Id: [0x00224E02]
The snakes?

Id: [0x00224E03]
The THUGS!!!

Id: [0x00224F62]
Just don't tell anyone I was here.

Id: [0x00224F63]
Sure, sure.

Id: [0x00224F64]
Funny. I was going to say the same to you.

Id: [0x00224F65]
You mean the trial? From what I've seen, you don't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00224F66]
Pah! The people love me. I am <i>the</i> Phidias! [beat]But there are others. Look.

Id: [0x00224F74]
Time to get that Token.

Id: [0x00224F81]
The people are happy.

Id: [0x00224F82]
As they should be! For the first time since Ares cursed us with war, the Delos Islands know freedom.

Id: [0x00224F86]
But where is Kyra? It's not like her to miss a chance to drink with her troops.

Id: [0x00224F87]
She told me you kept her secret... I'm still shocked. Podarkes was a complicated man, but he was still her father. She snuck off to send him to the Ferryman alone.

Id: [0x00224F8A]
Good. I found Kyra. We sent her father to the Ferryman.

Id: [0x00224F8B]
I heard. She's with her troops now, regaling them with stories of her greatest hunts... You did the honorable thing.

Id: [0x00224F8C]
If only Kyra had chosen to be here with us.

Id: [0x00224F8D]
Where is she? It's not like her to miss a chance to drink, and we were going to share stories of our greatest hunts.

Id: [0x00224F91]
She chose to join Podarkes. They'll pass the Styx together.

Id: [0x00224F93]
Impossible. [&breath]May her waters be calm, and the fire burn through the gloom.

Id: [0x00224F98]
Good idea. Everyone loves a good tale, Barnabas, especially yours. But first, we need to talk about Thaletas...

Id: [0x00224F99]
You've heard from the young man? I've been waiting to share old battle stories with <i>him</i>, too. He wanted to know how I lost this eye.

Id: [0x00224FA0]
She left the island. It was time for another life.

Id: [0x00224FA2]
Young warriors today! In my youth, we let ourselves enjoy the important things - singing, friendship, and drinking.

Id: [0x00224FAA]
Thaletas attacked me on the beach. He thinks I stole his glory.

Id: [0x00224FAC]
Spartans. If you're here, then I assume the fight went as it always does when someone tries to get the better of you. It might be wise to keep this a secret, for now.

Id: [0x00224FAD]
Thaletas set sail back to Sparta... alone.

Id: [0x00224FAF]
Without his troops? That <i>boy</i> would chase glory right off a cliff and into the Styx!

Id: [0x00224FB3]
Go!

Id: [0x00224FBE]
Indeed he does! He's just up the stairs, that way. I've been meaning to tell him how I lost this eye.

Id: [0x00224FBF]
Make the tale great. The troops deserve it. [beat]Thaletas especially.

Id: [0x00224FC0]
Certainly... if you can find him. And when you do, remind him - I still plan to tell him how I lost this eye.

Id: [0x00224FC3]
On your order. Even Neokles, the one you sent to us, is at the ready. But first, the crew could enjoy a drink and a song. You deserve one, too.

Id: [0x00224FCF]
Comes with the job, I guess.

Id: [0x00224FD5]
Barnabas said you'd be here... Saying goodbye to family isn't easy, even if your father is Podarkes.

Id: [0x00224FD8]
You shouldn't have to say goodbye alone.

Id: [0x00224FDD]
I'm glad I'm not alone. I've wanted to watch him burn for so long. Now that it's happened... I thought I'd feel peace.

Id: [0x00224FDE]
And what <i>do</i> you feel?

Id: [0x00224FDF]
I used to feel vengeful... Now... empty.

Id: [0x00225081]
I never thought we'd see smiling faces on <i>this</i> island. You've done well.

Id: [0x00225087]
I may not be a "champion," but as a working <i>misthios,</i> I've been in my share of dust ups.

Id: [0x00225088]
That <i>does</i> sound promising.

Id: [0x00225089]
Drakios said you need a training partner... And I need a training partner...

Id: [0x0022508A]
You might finally be the one I require to get into the Battle. If we train together, we can both officially enter.

Id: [0x0022508D]
Thaletas. What are you doing out here?

Id: [0x00225090]
I'm just a working <i>misthios</i>, not a "champion." Still, I might be able to help with your problem.

Id: [0x00225091]
Thinking... Praying... We should talk.

Id: [0x00225092]
Us? Thaletas...

Id: [0x00225093]
Leave your crew... Come with me. [beat]Join my side, and we can win glory for Sparta together.

Id: [0x00225096]
Thinking. Praying. [beat]This was my time, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022509C]
Well, I won't be able to pay you in any traditional way, but I am a sanctioned competitor in the Battle. If you train with me, we can both officially enter.

Id: [0x002250A0]
I tried to be reasonable. I am not reasonable. I. Am. Spartan.

Id: [0x002250A8]
Me? By your side? That's why you're out here?

Id: [0x002250B1]
You... you don't feel the same.

Id: [0x002250E9]
Nice move.

Id: [0x002250EB]
Stings, doesn't it, champion?

Id: [0x002250EC]
I've felt worse.

Id: [0x002250F1]
<i>That</i> hurt.

Id: [0x002250F5]
Ooh, I've made you angry.

Id: [0x002250FE]
He needed saving, so I saved him.

Id: [0x00225107]
You're cute when you're angry.

Id: [0x00225108]
What?

Id: [0x0022510F]
Sokrates said you're the one who saved my pater!

Id: [0x00225111]
That's not true! You're a hero!

Id: [0x00225112]
Your <i>pater</i> wasn't like the other rebels. I don't know if they'd welcome him here. You're not safe.

Id: [0x00225113]
It's all right now! Sokrates said the fighting is over, and Delians can all be friends again.

Id: [0x00225116]
I'm not angry.

Id: [0x00225117]
Of course not.[laughs]

Id: [0x0022511C]
Chaire. And try to stay out of trouble.

Id: [0x0022511D]
[&breath]You're not safe. The rebels are drinking and getting rowdy.

Id: [0x0022511E]
They said they're building a school. I'm going to learn to read legends of heroes like you!

Id: [0x0022511F]
If you're here, where are your parents?

Id: [0x00225120]
<i>Mater's</i> at home. I told her we were safe, but she says we have to leave now - that the bad people will come for us.

Id: [0x00225125]
Thank you for saving <i>pater</i>!

Id: [0x00225129]
You want to get Euripides drunk... Are you hoping he's going to make an even bigger scene than you did?

Id: [0x0022512A]
Ha! We both know that's not possible. But you're a feisty one, to say the least.

Id: [0x00225132]
How's Euripides? Drunk, I hope.

Id: [0x00225133]
I'm sure it's a real honor to have you hiding in his kitchen.

Id: [0x00225134]
You're awfully worked up over Euripides. You sure you're just friends?

Id: [0x00225135]
I'm never "just" anything, foreigner. Though I confess, Euripides and I hold a bond deeper than brotherhood. Why he slums it with that banal young plaything, Aristophanes, I'll never know.

Id: [0x0022513E]
Hippokrates in Argos... Here I come.

Id: [0x00225151]
You should find Hippokrates in Argos. I'm sure he'll help you.

Id: [0x00225157]
Dionysos! There you are. Everyone else here is boring. Let's play a singing game. You like to sing? You like to sing.

Id: [0x0022515E]
I'm not singing.

Id: [0x00225161]
Let's do this.

Id: [0x00225162]
I want to play too! But who should start?

Id: [0x00225164]
What did you have in mind?

Id: [0x00225165]
One of us will sing, then the other, and then back again. We'll take turns making verses, and whoever makes the best is the winner.

Id: [0x00225166]
Sing with me. Friends sing with each other. That's just what friends do. And you, me - we're friends.

Id: [0x0022516A]
I think you should, Aristophanes.

Id: [0x0022516B]
Fine, fine. But let's do a good one. A battle song?

Id: [0x0022516C]
Is there any other kind?

Id: [0x0022516D]
<i>At the flick of a limb, comes Aspasia's whim. And Perikles's walls aim to contain us all, within.</i>

Id: [0x00225171]
Euripides should start. It was his idea.

Id: [0x00225172]
Fine, fine. But let's do a good one. A battle song?

Id: [0x00225173]
Is there any other kind?

Id: [0x00225174]
<i>At the flick of a limb, comes Aspasia's whim. And Perikles's walls aim to contain us all, within.</i>

Id: [0x00225179]
<i>The Spartan hordes outside eat your cattle and children alive. They dance at your walls - they don't rain, but they squall...</i>

Id: [0x0022517A]
Perikles guarantees death for us all!

Id: [0x0022517E]
<i>What Spartan families lose, they lose for duty. When Spartan fathers refuse, they refuse beauty...</i>

Id: [0x00225180]
But the dangerous part are the Athenian tarts, who go for the meat when they should go for the heart!

Id: [0x00225184]
<i>The war... Has come to Athens... No time to...</i>

Id: [0x00225185]
<i>And we have no time to care what happens! So, take your sword and shield! Let blood paint what you wield! Until the boys lay like wheat upon the fields!</i>

Id: [0x00225188]
<i>Oh, so bring your merchants! And bring their butlers! If they be sons, then bring their fathers! This is war, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x0022518A]
<i>Bring your murderers to the crimson quiver! Bring the helots, if they be spillers! It is war, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x0022518F]
<i>Collect your weak and collect your sinners! Line them up at the phalanx dinner! This is war, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x00225191]
<i>If they want blood, then blood you'll give them!</i>

Id: [0x00225192]
<i>I'll stab their guts, and let them spill it! This is war, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x00225195]
<i>Without our fathers or mothers, we row straight to Hades or the belly of Milos. We are alone, and so we row. For a short life, we row, row, row.</i>

Id: [0x0022519B]
<i>War is... tough... The more we fight, the more we...</i>

Id: [0x0022519C]
<i>The more we love! Let the juices flow from heart to spear. We have nothing to fear when death is near. Our bodies bring with them nothing they hold dear.</i>

Id: [0x0022519F]
<i>The stupid sweepers? The genius teachers? All just meats, and juice, and liver!</i>

Id: [0x002251A4]
<i>For when our wars are done, after lives are lost and blood has run, we must rejoin our broken daughters and our sons. Reunited together, we will be one.</i>

Id: [0x002251AA]
<i>So grab your spears and grab your daggers! Plunge them deep in! Heroes they'll make us! This is war! War! War!</i>

Id: [0x002251AC]
<i>This is -</i><LF>

Id: [0x002251AD]
<i>War, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x002251AE]
<i>War, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x002251B2]
<i>There's hope... For peace...</i>

Id: [0x002251B3]
<i>Tomorrow, at least! But today we live and breathe, so we fight to the teeth!</i>

Id: [0x002251B9]
Enough! Enough. You... you're a great singer.

Id: [0x002251BA]
The best! You should act in my plays!

Id: [0x002251BB]
Here, take this to remember the occasion! This party has turned out much better than I ever could have expected.

Id: [0x002251BF]
That was awful. I'm not sure you even know how to sing.

Id: [0x002251C0]
We might be too drunk. That was the worst song I've ever heard.

Id: [0x002251CB]
It's not safe to talk here. We've got to go.

Id: [0x002251D0]
I'm not sure who you are, but I'm grateful.

Id: [0x002251D9]
I can go get him, and Kassandra can help! Everyone listens when she talks.

Id: [0x002251E3]
That'll be fine. Run along, Kassandra will be right behind you.

Id: [0x002251E5]
Oh, now. To convince someone in this house, even your eyes must tell a lie.

Id: [0x002251E7]
Fine, it was me. But my actions were personal, not political.

Id: [0x002251EB]
I did what I had to, and I'd do it again. I make no apologies.

Id: [0x002251F2]
You never really get used to them.

Id: [0x002251FC]
Now do me a favor and get Perikles to come down here and greet his guests.

Id: [0x00225203]
I'll help you however I can during your travels.

Id: [0x00225211]
Eagle Bearer. You're just in time. A battle's brewing, and we could use a mercenary of your strength to conquer Spartan borders today.

Id: [0x00225213]
Have you reconsidered my offer, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00225214]
Ready to join us on the battlefield?

Id: [0x00225216]
Have you changed your mind about joining us?

Id: [0x00225219]
Ah, finally ready to take up my offer?

Id: [0x0022521A]
Having second thoughts about my offer? There's drachmae to be made.

Id: [0x00225222]
I've hunted many beasts. What am I hunting this time?

Id: [0x0022522A]
Ha! A true warrior. Let's bring those filthy Spartans to their knees.

Id: [0x0022522B]
I'll fight with you.

Id: [0x0022522C]
You're not from around here, are you?

Id: [0x0022522D]
Came through Arkadia, but Korinthia is my home.

Id: [0x00225231]
I'll find the beast and kill it. Try not to bleed out before I return.

Id: [0x0022523A]
You're the misthios who bears the Eagle of Zeus. [beat]My apologies, these are dangerous times for anyone waging war against the Athenian empire and the Delian league. I am Kyra.

Id: [0x0022523D]
Your note mentions Podarkes. I'm going to find him.

Id: [0x00225243]
Was?

Id: [0x0022524A]
No, you found her - she wasn't alone. [beat]I know how much of a friend she was to you.

Id: [0x0022524B]
My blade is yours.

Id: [0x0022524C]
You'll get your share of the spoils. [beat]But first, victory.

Id: [0x0022524D]
All right. I'm in.

Id: [0x0022524E]
Glad to hear it. Let's send those Spartans to Hades.

Id: [0x0022524F]
My spear is yours.

Id: [0x00225250]
We'll make good use of it. Now, on to victory.

Id: [0x00225251]
I'll fight with Athens today.

Id: [0x00225256]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x00225258]
Then you'll fight with honor, too. Let's bring pain to those Spartans.

Id: [0x00225261]
Out of your hands? You sent her away. You could have protected her.

Id: [0x00225262]
What I asked of her was needed to protect Perikles. She lived to help others, Kassandra. She lived to help<i> you</i>.

Id: [0x00225269]
I know that.

Id: [0x0022526A]
That doesn't take anything away from the tragedy. She was a special girl.

Id: [0x0022526C]
Where once we gathered to forget our problems, now we meet them head on.

Id: [0x0022526F]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x00225274]
It's a tragedy. She should be here.

Id: [0x00225275]
Of course she should. But you know the cost of living this life.

Id: [0x00225277]
I do. But did Phoibe?

Id: [0x0022527E]
I don't have time for this.

Id: [0x0022527F]
Come back if you change your mind before the battle starts. We pay our help well - even latecomers.

Id: [0x00225280]
Aristophanes apparently has some play he thinks will do the job.

Id: [0x00225285]
Athenians don't scare me, but I can't set sail just yet.

Id: [0x00225288]
Aspasia, you're here.

Id: [0x00225289]
Any sign of Perikles?

Id: [0x0022528A]
If he's here, he's inside praying. He refused to stay safe in the villa.

Id: [0x0022528B]
Things have gotten even worse in the agora. It's madness.

Id: [0x0022528C]
Speak later and act now. Perikles -

Id: [0x0022528E]
[&scream]Go![/&scream]

Id: [0x00225294]
I need to speak to Aspasia.

Id: [0x00225295]
We must find Perikles first. He's missing -

Id: [0x00225297]
I don't fucking care! Tell me where Aspasia is!

Id: [0x00225298]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x0022529A]
[&cry]I'm sorry... Phoibe.

Id: [0x0022529E]
I won't let them get away with this.

Id: [0x0022529F]
You have to fight. For her.

Id: [0x002252A1]
I have other things to do.

Id: [0x002252A2]
Take some time to think this over. My offer will stand until the battle begins.

Id: [0x002252A7]
I came here to help you deal with one man, not go to war.

Id: [0x002252A8]
Which is why I sent word of our rebellion to the mighty Kassandra, and Sparta, too.

Id: [0x002252AC]
Podarkes discovered the other camp and sent Athenian soldiers to attack.

Id: [0x002252AD]
<i>Maláka</i>!

Id: [0x002252B4]
The Adrestia and I have faced greater challenges than a few Athenian ships.

Id: [0x002252B5]
You fight like Achilles reborn, but even you couldn't defeat the entire navy.

Id: [0x002252C2]
Sparta's sons are close. We need to break the Athenian navy.

Id: [0x002252D7]
Aspasia went to find Perikles at the Parthenon. She should be there.

Id: [0x002252D9]
I think we'd better go with her.

Id: [0x002252DA]
I agree, my friend. I agree.

Id: [0x002252E4]
[&laughs]If you think I'm going to miss a chance to kill Athenians, you're the one who's drunk.

Id: [0x002252E6]
The bear's dead.

Id: [0x002252E7]
You sure?

Id: [0x002252E8]
I know when something is dead.

Id: [0x002252E9]
You've saved my life.

Id: [0x002252EB]
I thought Delos was the heart of the Delian League - Athens's pride and joy.

Id: [0x002252EE]
I don't feel like fighting today.

Id: [0x002252EF]
If you find a second wind, see me before the battle begins.

Id: [0x002252F0]
We were. Until Athens took the League's treasury away from Delos.

Id: [0x002252F2]
So they could build a statue of Athena mocking Apollo.

Id: [0x002252F3]
The people pleaded with Podarkes not to trust Athens with the treasury. But his thirst for power made him deaf to his people.

Id: [0x002252F6]
You can survive this one without me.

Id: [0x002252F7]
Some of us will, some of us won't. Come back if you change your mind before the battle begins.

Id: [0x002252F8]
You'll need to find someone else. I don't have time for this right now.

Id: [0x00225300]
It is only that our physical world, even when visible, is not entirely provable, as I can never guarantee - or rather, prove - that your observation is what I require in order to express my conclusions accurately.

Id: [0x00225301]
A word of advice: save yourself from this conversation while you still can.

Id: [0x00225304]
Think it over. We could use all the help we can get... and we pay well, too.

Id: [0x00225305]
If things are so miserable, why doesn't Delos abandon the League?

Id: [0x00225306]
Podarkes sends Athenian soldiers to collect money from us all. The moment that stops, Athenian ships will burn our islands to the ground.

Id: [0x00225307]
The bear is dead. I've never seen one like it.

Id: [0x00225308]
You killed it? So this is over.

Id: [0x00225309]
I found some bloody handprints and a shipping record near a broken cage.

Id: [0x0022530C]
The bear is dead, and that's all that matters.

Id: [0x0022530D]
What matters is my pay.

Id: [0x0022530E]
Here, you've earned it. Now let me bleed in peace.

Id: [0x00225314]
<i>Chaire</i>, <i>misthios</i>. If you've got a ready ship and crew, we'll pay well for you to sail into battle with us.

Id: [0x00225316]
What's going on?

Id: [0x00225317]
Those malákes Spartans think they can wage war on our navy. We need to show them who rules the sea. Are you with us?

Id: [0x00225319]
Hmm, maybe you could help us out. You've got the arms of a sailor.

Id: [0x0022531A]
I came to help a "fierce group of rebels." But I show up, and you're all drunk.

Id: [0x00225323]
All you people do is talk. I'd rather not.

Id: [0x00225325]
Sure, we can talk. What about?

Id: [0x00225326]
Before Protagoras changed the subject, we were talking about the next great leader of Athens - Kleon.

Id: [0x00225332]
You're back.

Id: [0x00225336]
I saw Kleon speaking at the Pnyx. He's a real man of the people.

Id: [0x00225337]
I take it you and Perikles aren't friends.

Id: [0x00225338]
Hardly! Hermippos led the charge to have Aspasia ostracized and to see Perikles stripped of power - not that it worked.

Id: [0x00225339]
Yet.

Id: [0x0022533A]
So! You have a taste for politics. That's certainly better than most of the elitist blowhards in this house.

Id: [0x0022533E]
I'll change the subject again. I'm looking for someone - a Spartan woman.

Id: [0x0022533F]
I wonder... if you found the woman, even if you saw her with your own eyes, would you believe her existence to be true?

Id: [0x00225340]
Spartan? Hopefully she's dead in the gutters - it's better than those mongrels deserve.

Id: [0x00225341]
This is getting nowhere. Forget it.

Id: [0x00225344]
I saw Kleon talk at the Pnyx. Even for a politician, he's scum.

Id: [0x00225345]
Bah, you sound like every other blowhard in this place. Kleon is a champion of the people, and he's ready to tear down Perikles's elitism.

Id: [0x00225346]
If you don't want to discuss that, then what?

Id: [0x00225348]
Slavery is natural. It is necessary.

Id: [0x0022534A]
Perikles is the past. He's more worried about losing a few precious statues than he is fighting and winning the war. Kleon will rule this city and return it to greatness - mark my words.

Id: [0x0022534B]
Slaves understand you better when you carve your rules into the backs of their heads.

Id: [0x00225366]
If you're an ally of Kleon, why would Perikles invite you?

Id: [0x00225367]
You're not from Athens, outsider. Here, we keep our enemies closest of all.

Id: [0x0022537A]
Depends on what your asking... and how much you're willing to pay.

Id: [0x0022537B]
Spartan vermin are targeting our navy in a coming battle. We need everyone with a ready boat and crew to pitch in. You'll be well compensated for your efforts.

Id: [0x0022537C]
Oh, forget it.

Id: [0x0022537D]
I'm looking for clues to help me find a woman. She was Spartan.

Id: [0x0022537E]
Looking and finding are quite different things, wouldn't you say? I could observe a priest offering sacrifice to the gods, but does that mean in so doing that I have, myself, found god? Or...

Id: [0x00225381]
Why isn't Aspasia here?

Id: [0x00225382]
Can you be certain she isn't? To observe her presence is still no guarantee that she is here.

Id: [0x00225383]
In my opinion, it's just like her to cower in the shadows while we stand out here in the light.

Id: [0x00225385]
This has been... useless. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00225386]
You've suffered enough. What the Delians don't know won't kill them.

Id: [0x00225387]
A <i>misthios</i> with a heart. You're as rare as that monster. Here, take what drachmae I have left.

Id: [0x00225389]
<i>Chaire</i>. And don't let the Delians catch you bleeding everywhere.

Id: [0x0022538B]
Tell me where you're from. Now.

Id: [0x0022538E]
[&breath]I came from Arkadia.

Id: [0x0022538F]
You're a smuggler. You only wanted the beast dead because you knew if it started killing Delians, they'd have your head.

Id: [0x00225390]
What would you have me do? I couldn't kill the thing. I tried! The Delians are crazy - do you know what they do to foreigners who bring death to their island?

Id: [0x00225391]
You know, the Delians would pay a good price for the person who brought this curse to their sacred land.

Id: [0x00225392]
You wouldn't!

Id: [0x00225393]
I would. Pay me, and maybe your secret dies along with that bear.

Id: [0x00225394]
Despicable <i>misthios! </i>My family is dead, and you want more drachmae?!

Id: [0x00225396]
I might be injured, but I can still kill you!

Id: [0x00225398]
I have sailed past the Sirens and into the mouth of Poseidon himself. The waves bow to me in fear!

Id: [0x00225399]
The stories will tell of how I killed Poseidon with his own trident and threw his fucking head to the sharks!

Id: [0x0022539A]
The Greek world bows to us. We are the new gods.

Id: [0x0022539D]
Empty words are best left unsaid.

Id: [0x0022539E]
Let no man be called happy before his death. Till then, he is not happy - only lucky.

Id: [0x0022539F]
Past, present, and future. Kneel to the Cultists of Kosmos.

Id: [0x002253A0]
This war will rage forever, and so will the Cult.

Id: [0x002253A2]
<i>Chaire</i>, <i>misthios</i>. Any chance you've got a boat and a seaworthy crew?

Id: [0x002253A3]
I do. Why do you ask?

Id: [0x002253A4]
Spartan scum are advancing on our waters, and a battle is about to break out. We need hired boats to defend our navy. Will you join us?

Id: [0x002253A5]
Will you sail with us after all?

Id: [0x002253A6]
Is your crew ready to earn its weight in drachmae?

Id: [0x002253AA]
The bear's dead, and you owe me payment. But first, let's talk about you. Arkadia, right?

Id: [0x002253AC]
All right, all right! We were smuggling the bear for a man named Sargon. Poseidon had other ideas - one of his storms crashed us here, and that evil beast broke free. It went right for the crew.

Id: [0x002253AD]
Will you help us defend our waters, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x002253AE]
Podarkes sounds like a cruel man.

Id: [0x002253B1]
He's worse. I once heard a family was late in paying their dues to the gods. Podarkes sent his men to their farm, and took the young ones from their beds...

Id: [0x002253B3]
The sooner I send this monster to Hades, the better.

Id: [0x002253B4]
Listen, I don't ask questions. I just follow orders.

Id: [0x002253B5]
My crew and I will make sure the Spartans feel Poseidon's wrath.

Id: [0x002253B6]
I like your spirit, <i>misthios</i>. We're going to need it.

Id: [0x002253B7]
I will be a son to Kosmos. And the Cult will be my family.

Id: [0x002253BB]
A bloody handprint. Hasn't been here long.

Id: [0x002253C0]
This record says the bear came from Arkadia.

Id: [0x002253C5]
This record says the bear came from Arkadia. That woman was smuggling the beast... But why?

Id: [0x002253C8]
You can find drachmae anywhere if you look hard enough. All it takes is a little persuasion.

Id: [0x002253CE]
Chaos is our greatest strength.

Id: [0x002253CF]
Athens has my boat and crew.

Id: [0x002253D0]
Glad to hear it. It's time to send the Spartans to their watery graves.

Id: [0x002253D1]
When do we set sail?

Id: [0x002253D2]
At once. Those Spartan dogs can't meet their end soon enough.

Id: [0x002253D3]
My crew isn't interested in a fight today.

Id: [0x002253D4]
Think it over, <i>misthios</i>. We pay well and we could use the help.

Id: [0x002253D7]
I'm sure you'll be fine without me.

Id: [0x002253D8]
The Cult of Kosmos will burn the old world to ashes and build anew.

Id: [0x002253D9]
Nothing gets past the Eyes of Kosmos.

Id: [0x002253DA]
Those that do not fear Kosmos can learn to breathe beneath the waves.

Id: [0x002253DC]
My offer will stand until we set sail if you change your mind.

Id: [0x002253DD]
My crew and I have other work to take care of.

Id: [0x002253DE]
This one pays well, so take some time to think it over. You have until we set sail to join us.

Id: [0x002253E0]
It's the Eagle Bearer! Maybe the fates are smiling on us after all.

Id: [0x002253E1]
What's going on?

Id: [0x002253E2]
Those shit-eating Spartans are attacking our navy, and we'll need captains like you to hold them off. Will you join us?

Id: [0x002253E3]
If it isn't the mighty warrior with the broken spear... Have you come to aid us?

Id: [0x002253E4]
What's the matter?

Id: [0x002253E5]
Those filthy Spartans are targeting our naval forces in an upcoming battle. We could really use your help sending them to underworld.

Id: [0x002253F2]
I'm sorry...

Id: [0x002253F3]
He runs the local garrison - his men are always here. They'd tell him in an instant if I was gone.

Id: [0x002253F9]
He was a great man. Perhaps greater than we even knew.

Id: [0x002253FD]
Never.

Id: [0x002253FF]
Eagle Bearer! I've heard you command one of the fiercest ships at sea.

Id: [0x00225403]
You and your rebels are too drunk to fight. Leave the soldiers to me.

Id: [0x0022540F]
Ah, Kassandra! Seeing you on Delos sets my heart at ease. So, tell me. How was your encounter with the rebellious prisoner?

Id: [0x00225420]
And if I do?

Id: [0x00225421]
Maybe you'd turn it on those shit-eating Spartans? They're attacking our navy.

Id: [0x00225422]
So what's it going to be, <i>misthios</i>? Ready to join the winning side?

Id: [0x0022542C]
Reconsidering the opportunity to sail with the finest navy in the Greek world, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00225432]
Have you changed your mind about sailing with Athens?

Id: [0x0022545B]
My crew and I will join you.

Id: [0x0022545C]
Glad to hear it. Let's feed the Spartans to the sharks.

Id: [0x00225472]
My crew and ship are ready.

Id: [0x00225473]
Excellent. We'll set sail shortly.

Id: [0x00225479]
When do we set out?

Id: [0x0022547A]
Right away. We need to take the Spartan scum aboard those ships by surprise.

Id: [0x002254BD]
My crew and I aren't interested in fighting right now.

Id: [0x002254BE]
If you change your mind, come find me before we set sail. We could always use more ships.

Id: [0x002254C5]
I'm busy right now, but it's always good to see you.

Id: [0x002254D4]
I've got other jobs right now.

Id: [0x002254D5]
We pay our mercenaries well, so take some time to think it over. My offer stands until we set out.

Id: [0x002254D6]
Not right now. You'll have to find someone else.

Id: [0x002254D7]
If you change your mind, my drachmae is on the table until we set sail.

Id: [0x002254DF]
The rebel was fighting for the freedom of his people. Sounds fine to me.

Id: [0x002254E0]
[&hmm]So, if stealing from the gods, breaking sacred laws, and killing a man don't warrant a death sentence, what does?

Id: [0x002254E1]
I've been stealing, killing, and breaking sacred laws for as long as I can remember.

Id: [0x002254E2]
<i>Misthios</i>. In case you haven't heard, Athens is recruiting.

Id: [0x00225504]
Ha! So you see yourself in this rebel...

Id: [0x00225505]
The man killed, stole, and broke every law on Delos. Of course he deserves death.

Id: [0x00225506]
[&hmm]Interesting. And what do you deserve? Have you not also killed, stolen, and broken every law on every island you've ever been to?

Id: [0x00225516]
They don't know what they're agreeing to.

Id: [0x00225517]
You helped me in Athens - even willingly. If only you were more like your brother now.

Id: [0x00225518]
A pity.

Id: [0x00225528]
Talos the Stone-Fist? That's just what I need today. <i>Another</i> broken nose.

Id: [0x00225531]
A bold choice in Spartan territory.

Id: [0x00225532]
We've got to be aggressive if we're going to wipe the Spartan navy from the horizon.

Id: [0x00225539]
Agreed, Perikles needs to know. I'll stay here and look for clues.

Id: [0x0022553B]
You're leaving me alone with these people?

Id: [0x0022553C]
Ha! You'll do fine without me. I promise. [beat]Just relax, talk to the others, and focus on finding your mother.

Id: [0x00225541]
You think you can?

Id: [0x00225542]
With hired help like you, yes. Will you join us as we sail to victory?

Id: [0x00225548]
There's much to do. And many unknowns on our horizon.

Id: [0x0022554A]
<i>Chaire</i>, <i>misthios</i>. If you'd like to lose a fight today, join the Spartan navy.

Id: [0x0022554B]
And if I'd like to win one?

Id: [0x0022554C]
Well... Set sail with Athens, of course.

Id: [0x0022554D]
Ah, mercenary. I don't suppose you sail with a battle-ready crew and ship?

Id: [0x0022554E]
And if I do?

Id: [0x0022554F]
All the better. Athens is recruiting ships for a decisive attack on the Spartan navy. Interested in sharing our victory?

Id: [0x00225550]
[&hmm]The mighty Eagle Bearer. Rumor has it you command one of the fiercest ships at sea. Maybe you'd be interested in making some drachmae off it?

Id: [0x00225551]
Depends how.

Id: [0x00225552]
Join Athens as we set sail to destroy the Spartan navy... that's all.

Id: [0x00225554]
I've heard a lot about you, Eagle Bearer. Maybe you'd be willing to share Zeus's favor with Athens today?

Id: [0x00225555]
I'd rather leave that up to Zeus.

Id: [0x00225556]
Then maybe just lend us your godlike skills in warfare. We're making a decisive attack on the Spartan navy soon and we could use your support.

Id: [0x00225557]
The warrior with the broken spear, eh? I've heard your skills on the battlefield are rivaled only by your skills at sea.

Id: [0x00225558]
Then you've heard right.

Id: [0x00225559]
We're in desperate need of your help to strike down Sparta's ships. Would you be willing to sail with us to victory?

Id: [0x0022557E]
What was that all about?

Id: [0x0022557F]
The military suspects me of smuggling deserters from the warfront.

Id: [0x00225580]
Did you see a man on your way here? Skinny sort of idiot, wearing army colors?

Id: [0x00225594]
I found a body near a cliff in the gulch. He had a note on him.

Id: [0x00225597]
Dead?! No, no, no! He can’t be dead! We had the perfect plan to get him home to his wife.

Id: [0x00225598]
I promised her I wouldn't let him end up like the other deserters...

Id: [0x0022559A]
Can't say I have.

Id: [0x0022559B]
Curses! I promised his wife I’d take him back to her in Kydonia.

Id: [0x0022559C]
Are you sure he ran away from the army, or from <i>her</i>?

Id: [0x0022559D]
The army. He's a dead man walking now.

Id: [0x002255A2]
You must be close to him to risk your life to help.

Id: [0x002255A3]
I-I did it for the girl.

Id: [0x002255A5]
There's always a girl, isn't there?

Id: [0x002255AB]
Look, he got drafted into the war -

Id: [0x002255AC]
She wouldn't stop crying.

Id: [0x002255AD]
So, I decided to help them get back together.

Id: [0x002255B0]
I just... want to see her smile, all right?

Id: [0x002255B5]
Girl? What girl? His wife?

Id: [0x00225773]
I'm going to pay this rebel a visit. Sounds like we have a lot in common.

Id: [0x00225776]
Let me answer that by asking you this - what exactly <i>is</i> justice?

Id: [0x00225777]
A brilliant question. He stole, which is wrong.

Id: [0x00225781]
I'd like to pay this rebel a visit.

Id: [0x00225782]
You told me he deserved death. Are you planning on serving it to him?

Id: [0x00225783]
I have no reason to kill him. But I am interested in what he has to say.

Id: [0x00225784]
As am I. As are we all.

Id: [0x002258B2]
Choose wisely.

Id: [0x0022593C]
I hope they know something about your mother.

Id: [0x0022593D]
Me too.

Id: [0x0022599D]
You could talk to Euripides - he's the second-most worldly man here, that pediculous, xanthodontous, exophthalmic... morosoph. But he doesn't talk without a drink.

Id: [0x002259E0]
I thought you might, though I have no drachmae to give. Only knowledge, which one should prefer for it is perpetual, not transitory.

Id: [0x002259E1]
Well that's... something. I think.

Id: [0x002259E9]
Ha! Let their blood feed the sharks.

Id: [0x00225AA6]
That doesn't matter. She had to sacrifice herself for others, over and over...

Id: [0x00225AA7]
And those who sacrifice themselves deserve more glory than any other. She is a hero in her own right.

Id: [0x00225AA9]
I hope she knew that.

Id: [0x00225AB8]
Cyclops's got a message for you!

Id: [0x00225ABB]
Tell your boss he can stick it - [up a goat's ass.]

Id: [0x00225ABE]
That's for last week!

Id: [0x00225AC1]
Hey, shit-face! Get down here!

Id: [0x00225AC2]
<i>Maláka!</i>

Id: [0x00225AC9]
Aspasia knew the danger, [&breath]and still she sent you.

Id: [0x00225AD0]
I'm sorry Phoibe, [&cry]you didn't deserve this.

Id: [0x00225AD7]
Stop!

Id: [0x00225AD9]
Kleon has ordered that no one leave Athens.

Id: [0x00225ADA]
The rebel can wait.

Id: [0x00225ADE]
As a coward.

Id: [0x00225B47]
And he wants Aspasia brought to him.

Id: [0x00225B49]
[&scream]Leave![/&scream]

Id: [0x00225B4A]
Don't let them go!

Id: [0x00225B53]
Stay close. Just in case.

Id: [0x00225B54]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00225B55]
Secret meetings, strange visitors - he gives me the creeps... You'll have to kill him. There's no other option.

Id: [0x00225B5D]
This was savage... Done to send a message.

Id: [0x00225B5F]
We have to move quickly.

Id: [0x00225B72]
It's all clear now. Let's go.

Id: [0x00225B74]
We're going to stay, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00225B75]
What? Why?

Id: [0x00225B76]
My work is here. I can't leave the Athenians in the state they're in.

Id: [0x00225B77]
You don't need us to protect Aspasia. Leave Athens to us.

Id: [0x00225B78]
The city has been taken. This isn't the Athens you used to know.

Id: [0x00225B7B]
Retrieve Phoibe's body. Give her a proper burial.

Id: [0x00225B7C]
Everything she deserves and more.

Id: [0x00225B7D]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00225B7E]
Time to go, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00225B9A]
I's not feeling too good...

Id: [0x00225B9F]
Of course.

Id: [0x00225BC2]
The farther we get from Athens, the quieter it grows. As though it's peaceful. [beat]But I know better.

Id: [0x00225BCA]
[&breath]About Phoibe...

Id: [0x00225BD2]
No, allow me. Phoibe was my responsibility. I should have kept her closer to me. It was a mistake.

Id: [0x00225BD3]
No, I wanted to apologize. It wasn't your fault. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00225BD4]
Yet another murder to the Cult's credit.

Id: [0x00225BD7]
Phoenix. Her ship was called Siren Song.

Id: [0x00225BD8]
Phoenix. [beat]Yes, I know the name. Last anyone heard, her ship was docked on the island of Naxos.

Id: [0x00225BDA]
If I'm to leave Athens, I'm not sure where I'll go.

Id: [0x00225BDB]
Here to see the outcome?

Id: [0x00225BDC]
The votes should be counted soon, and this will all be over with.

Id: [0x00225BDD]
You look slightly out of place here.

Id: [0x00225BE6]
I've seen an ostracism or twelve in my day, but this is one of the best.

Id: [0x00225C01]
And how do you want me to help?

Id: [0x00225C02]
Help Athens, not me. The Spartans howl outside our city walls. Create chaos among their ranks - make them suffer as we do.

Id: [0x00225C03]
You never told me he was an extremist lunatic.

Id: [0x00225C04]
Ah, but who am I to judge what is too much, or too crazy? Are we not both at some point or another?

Id: [0x00225C17]
The rebel had guards. I... relieved them.

Id: [0x00225C18]
[&hmm]Interesting. You thought the life of a thief and a murderer was worth more than that of soldiers doing their duty.

Id: [0x00225C19]
I wasn't even thinking about him, to be honest.

Id: [0x00225C1A]
There may have been a few drops, but everyone survived.

Id: [0x00225C1B]
[&hmm]Interesting. A mercenary who carries blades of death wherever she goes, and yet in this particular case, she chose life.

Id: [0x00225C1C]
And what of the rebel?

Id: [0x00225C32]
But they would have certainly killed me, so thank you.

Id: [0x00225C33]
I don't think they'd eat you.

Id: [0x00225C34]
Should be on his way back to Mykonos, if he knows what's good for him.

Id: [0x00225C40]
Good thing you arrived, Kassandra. I'm still exhausted from the ambush at the jail.

Id: [0x00225C46]
It's all coming together. I think we have a real chance.

Id: [0x00225C47]
This act will avenge Perikles. I know he'd be proud.

Id: [0x00225C4D]
The rebels won't be safe as long as the Athenian commanders breathe.

Id: [0x00225C55]
March on them and they'll see you coming. [beat]I work better alone. I'll take care of these commanders.

Id: [0x00225C57]
You're going straight for their throats.

Id: [0x00225C59]
The commanders will live... for now.

Id: [0x00225C60]
He's dead. Probably for the best.

Id: [0x00225C61]
[&hmm]Best for Delos? Best for the rebellion? Or best for you?

Id: [0x00225C62]
He should be halfway to Mykonos by now.

Id: [0x00225C63]
Oh really? You let that lunatic run loose? Are you sure that was wise?

Id: [0x00225C64]
Our choices are like ripples on water. They seem tiny and insignificant at the beginning, but they can become devastating tidal waves by the time they run their course.

Id: [0x00225C9A]
One of the records Agapios needs.

Id: [0x00225CA0]
Maybe this will help Agapios identify The Dagger's leader...

Id: [0x00225CA6]
Records of ship names - what docked where and when. This might help Agapios.

Id: [0x00225CAE]
Are these the records you need?

Id: [0x00225CB4]
Go to Isabel, she's at her house in Kydonia. It's the one with the green cloth! I'll catch up.

Id: [0x00225CC3]
A slave without a master... is<i> free.</i>

Id: [0x00225CC7]
That must be the house. <i>Maláka</i>! There are already guards there.

Id: [0x00225CCA]
I've already explored The Dagger's ship.

Id: [0x00225CD3]
You must know a few things about Agapios.

Id: [0x00225CD4]
But I'll tell you the only thing that matters - he's a good man. He values trust above all else.

Id: [0x00225CDA]
Dystos Fort... It's big. The husband could be anywhere in there.

Id: [0x00225CDE]
If I follow the road east, I should be able to follow the husband's tracks.

Id: [0x00225CEE]
Keep your head down. We've got to make it to the road.

Id: [0x00225CF4]
No matter what happens, keep going. I won't let you die.

Id: [0x00225DAA]
Oh good, you came. Things are worse than I feared. Kleon has turned the mob. We have to hurry.

Id: [0x00225DAB]
Where?

Id: [0x00225DAC]
To Perikles.

Id: [0x00225DAE]
You missed.

Id: [0x00225DC3]
We can't have two minds about this. The Cult must decide.

Id: [0x00225DDB]
Impiety is no small crime. Anaxagoras deserves exile.

Id: [0x00225DE8]
This must be the house of Metiochos's attackers, but the letter proves they're just tools in someone else's plan. [beat]Whose?

Id: [0x00225DEB]
[&groan]Poor Aktis.

Id: [0x00225E2D]
The winner's purse will reflect your contribution, <i>misthios</i>. The Battle will commence soon. Meet me inside the city gate when you're ready.

Id: [0x00225E92]
Start here - this district is your home. Ignore the politicians and concentrate on where you can make change.

Id: [0x00225E93]
Thank you, we will try.

Id: [0x00225E9A]
I already heard. Their forces are in chaos, and soldiers are defecting. Sparta owes you. I owe you.

Id: [0x00225EA2]
Perfect timing, Eagle Bearer! Interested in joining us on the battlefield as we gut those Spartan dogs?

Id: [0x00225EAD]
We need to do something!

Id: [0x00225EB5]
Athens is [&scream]doomed![/&scream]

Id: [0x00225EB6]
Perikles brought us to this!

Id: [0x00225EB7]
Out with Perikles!

Id: [0x00225EBF]
You look as healthy as ever.

Id: [0x00225EC2]
Tell Aspasia that. She won't worry so much about me.

Id: [0x00225EC4]
I admit you don't quite look yourself.

Id: [0x00225EC6]
I don't feel like myself, either.

Id: [0x00225ED2]
Phoibe!

Id: [0x00225ED7]
Well done, Kassandra. Well done. Your final challenge takes you to the volcano to the east.

Id: [0x00225ED8]
And then you'll give me the information I want about the Cult.

Id: [0x00225ED9]
Indeed, I will. But before that, one contestant remains.

Id: [0x00225EDD]
A physician named Hippokrates may have seen her in Argos.

Id: [0x00225EDE]
He's a good man. If you find a woman named Agathe there, do let her know Aspasia sends her regards. [beat]What else?

Id: [0x00225EDF]
Alkibiades gave me the name of a woman in Korinth.

Id: [0x00225EE1]
I'm <i>sure</i> he did. My dear friend, Anthousa, is the only one I know who's enjoyed a life in Korinth through legitimate means... mostly legitimate, anyway.

Id: [0x00225EE2]
That's all I have.

Id: [0x00225EF9]
You're the one who killed the Monger, aren't you?

Id: [0x00225EFF]
That's right. That <i>maláka</i> would have brought down that entire region.

Id: [0x00225F00]
You did Sparta an incredible favor taking him out. After a feat like that, this request will be easy.

Id: [0x00225F02]
That was rough. The people of Korinthia needed new leadership, desperately.

Id: [0x00225F03]
Brasidas will be handsomely rewarded for what was done. Sparta owes you their thanks for silencing him. [beat]But I have another favor to ask.

Id: [0x00225F05]
Go on.

Id: [0x00225F06]
The villagers have been complaining about someone robbing their food stores by night. I believe the stolen goods are being kept hidden in a nearby bandit camp.

Id: [0x00225F10]
Then our sacrifice would set fire to the hearts of the rebels! They'll cast every non-Delian into the sea for Poseidon to chew up and spit out!

Id: [0x00225F23]
I can't let you go back to Mykonos alone.

Id: [0x00225F24]
I knew it! You're one of them. You don't belong here. I'll send you and your kind to the Styx!

Id: [0x00225F26]
Go, and don't come back. Every soldier on Delos will be looking for you.

Id: [0x00225F27]
Let them find me. I already sent one to his grave, I'd love to send another!

Id: [0x00225F2C]
Listen to her, Perikles.

Id: [0x00225F2D]
I'm... related to one of the Cult members. And I believe him when he says they're coming after you.

Id: [0x00225F3C]
I try and ease the suffering where I can.

Id: [0x00225F4E]
What fanatics?

Id: [0x00225F4F]
The Followers of Ares - superstitious fools. They believe burning the dead is sacrilege, and attacked me. Can you believe it?

Id: [0x00225F52]
Shame nobody told the beast roaming around. Drachmae to the one who kills it.

Id: [0x00225F53]
[&gasp]I'd call it a bear, but I'd be lying. This creature is Artemis's nightmare.

Id: [0x00225F55]
You're the one people have been talking about. The child of Nikolaos and Myrrine. The one who survived the fall.

Id: [0x00225F5D]
I am. But I prefer to be called "<i>misthios.</i>"

Id: [0x00225F5E]
Ever since you came back, chaos has overtaken order. You need to make things right again.

Id: [0x00225F60]
You must be thinking of someone else.

Id: [0x00225F61]
Lying won't get you anywhere in Sparta. I know you had a hand in the exile of King Pausanias. We need to work together now to restore order.

Id: [0x00225F63]
All that happened a long time ago. I'd rather not think about it.

Id: [0x00225F64]
"The past is certain, and the future is obscure." I know you're the reason Pausanias no longer reigns, and good or bad, Sparta will suffer for it. We need your help.

Id: [0x00225F66]
What do you need done?

Id: [0x00225F67]
With only one king on the throne, Sparta is vulnerable. Leaders of Athenian and bandit camps alike are trying to capitalize on our position.

Id: [0x00225F7C]
Your life? How?

Id: [0x00225F7D]
[&groan]Uh...[/&groan] I meant the lives that beast could have taken. [&groan]Now I need to get off this filthy island. Here, take this. [&breath]Not much, but it's what I got.

Id: [0x00225F7F]
Where's the beast now?

Id: [0x00225F80]
Got as far away from that thing as I could. You'll find it north of here, near the coast. Just follow the trail of bodies - the bloodier the mess, the closer you are.

Id: [0x0022601D]
<i>Chaire, misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022613D]
Yes...

Id: [0x0022613E]
The bear was being smuggled from Arkadia. I found a record of what was on your ship, <i>and</i> your bloody handprints.

Id: [0x0022613F]
That explains the bodies.

Id: [0x00226140]
They were my family!

Id: [0x00226145]
So you let a bloodthirsty bear roam free?

Id: [0x00226146]
We were smuggling cargo from Arkadia to Kos for a man named Sargon. Ran aground during a storm, and the bear broke loose and killed the crew.

Id: [0x00226147]
I know. I saw the bodies.

Id: [0x00226148]
Those bodies were my friends! Please, I'll pay you. You can't tell the Delians this was my fault.

Id: [0x0022614C]
[&groan]Should go to a temple... [&breath]Heard the priests there do a good job healing wounds.

Id: [0x0022631C]
Did you find Thespis? My play must have its star.

Id: [0x00226338]
Do something worthwhile and join my crew. You're loyal, and you follow orders.

Id: [0x002263FD]
I'll be waiting for you at the water's edge in the extremely unlikely event you survive.

Id: [0x0022640C]
How would you react if I said the name... "Melite"?

Id: [0x0022640E]
Uh, Melite? Well, I -

Id: [0x00226410]
No. I've never heard of them. It's a strange name, one I'd remember.

Id: [0x00226411]
...Did you just say Minotaur <i>"Pre-Trials"</i>?

Id: [0x00226412]
To face the Minotaur, you must first prove yourself <i>worthy</i> by completing three heroic trials.

Id: [0x00226414]
We can't let people fresh off of the triremes casually stroll to their deaths!

Id: [0x00226416]
Pephka policy.

Id: [0x00226417]
What exactly is the "Prize of Pephka"?

Id: [0x00226418]
Why, its limitless riches of course! Warriors defeated by the Minotaur no longer need their drachmae, so we collect their coins into a grand prize that only a champion who kills the beast may claim.

Id: [0x00226419]
Your grand prize is drachmae looted from the dead?!

Id: [0x0022641B]
<i>Misthios</i>, please believe me, many of those coins go straight to the Lato School for Children Whose Parents Were Tragically Killed By the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0022641C]
I see.

Id: [0x0022641D]
What do these Pre-Trials require me to do, exactly?

Id: [0x0022641E]
There's the Trial of Strength, where you fight the greatest warrior in all of Krete. The Trial of Accuracy, which only a keen eye can overcome! And the Trial of Endurance, where you must brave...

Id: [0x0022641F]
One of your Trials is swimming?! That's - [&gasp]this is a scheme to fleece me.

Id: [0x00226421]
[&gasp]Misthios, I - that's - how could you even think such a thing?

Id: [0x00226423]
You're a terrible person.

Id: [0x00226425]
Tell me about your "Minotaur."

Id: [0x00226427]
Part man, part beast, <i>all monster. </i>His horns are as sharp as blades, and his blades are as sharp as... horns? Wait, no, I always mess that up -

Id: [0x00226428]
A vivid portrait. You must have seen him personally.

Id: [0x00226429]
Many times. And I'll tell you this much - no one's ever returned from where he dwells.

Id: [0x0022642B]
I'll do your Trials -

Id: [0x0022642C]
<i>Pre-</i>Trials!

Id: [0x0022642D]
- I'll do your <i>Pre-Trials, </i>but then the Minotaur's head is mine.

Id: [0x0022642E]
Fantastic! Don't forget to collect Tokens of Success from the Trial Masters to prove your victories.

Id: [0x00226430]
I've heard enough - I'll complete the Trials.

Id: [0x00226436]
Nothing stands in the way of glory. Statues aren't carved to honor the insignificant.

Id: [0x00226437]
And what about my daughter? Is she insignificant, "hero"?

Id: [0x00226439]
Not everyone with a sword seeks glory. Family comes before all else.

Id: [0x0022643A]
Exactly, <i>misthios</i>. That's what I keep telling this cowardly slime in the shape of my husband.

Id: [0x0022643C]
...Hey!

Id: [0x0022643D]
It's - it's our daughter.

Id: [0x0022643F]
Your daughter?

Id: [0x00226440]
Amara. She ran off days ago.

Id: [0x00226441]
I'm sure she's - she's just fine!

Id: [0x00226443]
Don't worry about Amara - not when there's a Minotaur to slay!

Id: [0x00226445]
"GRR!" "Slash-slash!" Big fight! Lots of blood! Think of the fame, <i>misthios</i>! Think of winning the <i>Prize of Pephka!</i>

Id: [0x00226448]
Please trust me, champion - nothing is what it seems in Pephka. Solving one problem may just solve all the others...

Id: [0x0022644E]
These Tokens?

Id: [0x00226450]
I - but - no! They have to be <i>validated</i> by the Trial Masters!

Id: [0x00226452]
Look closer.

Id: [0x00226453]
<i>The Tokens have been validated!</i>

Id: [0x00226455]
Ugh, another "champion," here to save us all from Pephka's long queues and overpriced Minotaur merchandise.

Id: [0x00226457]
Ah, may I introduce my wife, Kore! A rare beauty, and so -

Id: [0x00226459]
- So loud, in front of my new friend.[&laughs]

Id: [0x0022645B]
Please, Leiandros - there are more important things than glory.

Id: [0x0022645F]
Meet me at the Warrior's Rest, where your adventure shall truly begin!

Id: [0x00226462]
Go, my legendary friend! The Pre-Trials of the Minotaur await!

Id: [0x00226495]
Or, can we at least <i>say</i> I struck the killing blow? ...I'm willing to haggle down to "played a key role in distracting the Minotaur while allowing the killing blow to be struck."

Id: [0x002264BF]
When the beast sees our assembled might, he will moo miserably in fear!

Id: [0x002264C0]
...Do Minotaurs moo, or... ?

Id: [0x002264C6]
Nothing to see here! Just a couple of brave warriors, bravely being brave. Move along!

Id: [0x002264C9]
There's no way we're up against something <i>that</i> complicated, brother!

Id: [0x002264CB]
We've completed the Pre-Trials of the Minotaur, and eagerly await the TRIALS of the Minotaur!

Id: [0x002264CC]
Do you think there'll be a Post-Trials of the Minotaur?

Id: [0x002264D2]
So when did you run away? Thirty seconds after us, or twenty?

Id: [0x002264D3]
I don't run.

Id: [0x002264D5]
[laughs]Right! Neither do we!

Id: [0x002264D7]
We need someone else to join our Official Minotaur Hunting Party. Talk to Leiandros if you're interested in <i>eternal glory</i>.

Id: [0x002264D8]
Honestly, who isn't?

Id: [0x002264DC]
Now to find the woman in Eretria.

Id: [0x002264E1]
Ah, I was hoping I'd see you again. Would you be a dear and bring me a drink?

Id: [0x002264E7]
I'll find the records. The guards don't stand a chance.

Id: [0x002264EA]
Perhaps there <i>is</i> someone left in Euboea who can be trusted.

Id: [0x002264FD]
<i>ROOOOOOOOAR!!!</i>

Id: [0x002264FF]
Is that him, brother?! He sounds large! I thought he was a <i>mini-</i>taur... Perhaps we should courageously flee?

Id: [0x00226500]
No, no, brother - onwards, into the dark!

Id: [0x00226505]
There's no glory here... only death.

Id: [0x0022650A]
No-no-no! I only ever wanted to be a baker!

Id: [0x0022650E]
Uh, I should check on my brother. The baking business can be quite fierce, you know!

Id: [0x0022651B]
Ominous. Must be in the right place.

Id: [0x0022651E]
Whatever lives down here <i>must</i> be a monster.

Id: [0x00226520]
The stories always made the minotaur seem... taller.

Id: [0x00226524]
<b><i>ROOOOOOO</i></b>[cough]<b><i>OOAR...!</i></b>

Id: [0x00226525]
Did the Minotaur just... cough?

Id: [0x00226528]
This is your last chance to flee, mortal!

Id: [0x0022652B]
<b><i>ROOOOOOOOAR!!!</i></b>

Id: [0x0022652C]
Maybe the man from the cliff died avoiding this fate... Disgusting.

Id: [0x0022652D]
Looks like some cannibals had a party here... Ugh.

Id: [0x00226532]
He must've fallen off this cliff running away from the cannibals. Not a good way to go.

Id: [0x00226535]
Who was he going to meet? I should find out.

Id: [0x00226539]
A battered shield... Armies must've clashed further upstream.

Id: [0x0022656D]
I'll be back as soon as I can.

Id: [0x002265AC]
The problem here does not end with the death of one person. We have the whole of Athens to consider.

Id: [0x002265D0]
If you think there's something at the akropolis, I'll find it.

Id: [0x002265D1]
There you should find proof of Kleon's offenses.

Id: [0x002265D6]
You were the one not paying attention...

Id: [0x002265DE]
Come on, Kassandra. Don't hold back.

Id: [0x002265E2]
You're more than just a pretty face.

Id: [0x002265E6]
Stop hitting like a child, and really hit me!

Id: [0x002265EA]
You fight well.

Id: [0x002265EE]
[&breath]No doubt in my mind. You trained in Sparta.[/&breath]

Id: [0x002265F2]
So, when does the real fighting begin?

Id: [0x002265F6]
You'll pay for that.

Id: [0x002265FA]
I've got you now.

Id: [0x0022660E]
Something happen to your shipment?

Id: [0x00226616]
Yes, idiots happened. They dropped it and shattered my obsidian glass.

Id: [0x0022661F]
But Sokrates, Kleon is a man of the people.

Id: [0x002266AE]
Did you need -

Id: [0x002266AF]
I'll get you your -

Id: [0x002266B0]
What? Is that a yes?

Id: [0x002266B5]
My blade is fine enough, thanks. I don't have time for this.

Id: [0x002266B6]
What?! Then we have nothing further to discuss.

Id: [0x002266BB]
Oh, look who's back.

Id: [0x002266BC]
The offer's still on the table. Fetch the obsidian glass, and my boss will give you his very own blade. Not to mention...

Id: [0x002266BD]
This should be enough.

Id: [0x002266BF]
You are well-stocked. You a merchant or a misthios, eh?[&laughs]

Id: [0x002266C4]
Here's your obsidian glass.

Id: [0x002266C5]
Excellently done, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00226762]
The Spartans may draw near to our walls, but we must come together now for the glory of Athens.

Id: [0x00226765]
Glory for you!

Id: [0x00226769]
Friends! Friends, please! Just because the Spartans are near our walls does not mean we can act like them.

Id: [0x0022676E]
A good crop! Shame the Spartans burned the fields where it grew.

Id: [0x00226773]
The Parthenon is glorious, Perikles, but at what cost? How many triremes could we have built instead?

Id: [0x00226774]
We must not become divided -

Id: [0x00226776]
We are <i>divided</i>, and the Spartans are winning! Act, Perikles, or I will!

Id: [0x002267A1]
Hey, come back here! Thief!

Id: [0x002267A6]
Kassandra, there you are! Good news, I hope?

Id: [0x002267CC]
I also found this.

Id: [0x002267CE]
You sneaky, sneaky <i>misthios</i>. Athenian wine.

Id: [0x002267CF]
When all this is said and done, I thought we might share some.

Id: [0x002267D6]
You surprise me. And to think I nearly threw my blade through your neck.

Id: [0x00226805]
You led me on a good chase, but I caught you. Hand it over.

Id: [0x00226806]
Hand what over?

Id: [0x00226808]
My drachmae. Give it back.

Id: [0x00226809]
Here, please don't hurt me. They made me do it, I didn't want to, honest...

Id: [0x0022680C]
Hush. I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.

Id: [0x00226811]
There's the smoke.

Id: [0x0022681B]
This looks like the beach, but he's not here.

Id: [0x0022681F]
What's this? A message.

Id: [0x00226821]
But the Captain will!

Id: [0x00226824]
Thaletas should be nearby.

Id: [0x0022682B]
Captain?

Id: [0x0022682C]
Sounds like this Captain needs a good talking to.

Id: [0x0022682D]
Us?

Id: [0x0022682F]
The other street kids!

Id: [0x00226830]
Yeah, it's him that makes us do this.

Id: [0x00226834]
And we will mourn them later.

Id: [0x00226835]
She's right. We shouldn't be standing here, drenched in Athenian blood.

Id: [0x00226836]
We'll be safe in the hideout[2315766]. Let's talk there.

Id: [0x0022683E]
There he is.

Id: [0x00226840]
Why's he making you steal?

Id: [0x00226841]
For the drachmae, stupid!

Id: [0x00226842]
You should be more polite to adults.

Id: [0x00226843]
Why? What've adults done for me?

Id: [0x00226845]
I was beginning to think you wouldn't come.

Id: [0x00226860]
Don't talk, just hit. He even stole my <i>mater's</i> necklace from me... Says I'll get it back if I steal for him.

Id: [0x00226861]
It's all that I had left of her...

Id: [0x0022686E]
Think wisely, although no one can truly know anything.

Id: [0x002268A3]
Keen-eyed Artemis, guide my bow.

Id: [0x002268A4]
Nice altar.

Id: [0x002268A6]
But your real concern should be, how skilled are you with that bow?

Id: [0x002268AE]
I don't need to pray to the gods to hit my targets.

Id: [0x002268AF]
[&laughs]They've been known to disguise themselves as animals. I just like to warn them I'm coming.

Id: [0x002268B1]
I've seen you hunt. You don't need my help.

Id: [0x002268B2]
Oh, I bet you capture any prey you lock those sharp eyes with.

Id: [0x002268C4]
You'd better be telling me everything.

Id: [0x002268C5]
All I know is they wanted to keep this actor busy. See for yourself - he's at the tavern.

Id: [0x002268C8]
You must find Thespis! What am I to do? This is a disaster. A disaster, I tell you!

Id: [0x002268CD]
<i>This</i> is where I come to train. I found it after arriving on Delos. Exhausting my body clears my mind.

Id: [0x002268D5]
It's a beautiful spot, Thaletas. I'm honored you'd share it with me.

Id: [0x002268D7]
This place is beautiful, Thaletas. As are you.

Id: [0x002268D9]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002268DA]
Fight me.

Id: [0x002268DD]
What I did, I did for the glory of Delos<i>.</i>

Id: [0x002268E6]
Tell my daughter... She should have killed me herself.

Id: [0x002268EE]
This was a great idea. I'm glad you invited me.

Id: [0x002268F0]
Or at least I thought I did... until you arrived.

Id: [0x002268F5]
My people will be well fed, and the gods will have their sacrifice, thanks to you.

Id: [0x002268F7]
You... But you just said...

Id: [0x002268FC]
So, the pirate has one blade at my throat and one at my stomach, and he says, "How do you want to die, <i>misthios</i>, fast or slow?"

Id: [0x00226903]
Because we've lived similar lives, been through similar struggles... Even though we grew up so far apart.

Id: [0x00226907]
Wine always helps loosen the tongue.

Id: [0x00226908]
It does.

Id: [0x0022690A]
I want you, Kassandra. Here. Now. Under the stars.

Id: [0x00226916]
Told him, Kleon will kill us all. It's more assaults than satire!

Id: [0x00226918]
I've wanted you since I laid eyes on you.

Id: [0x00226922]
My parents said you'll either be an actor or a drunk... Ha, fooled them. I becames both!

Id: [0x0022692B]
Wheee, giddy ups!

Id: [0x00226934]
You's sooo strong, Aikaterine.

Id: [0x00226939]
Kyra, I'm flattered.

Id: [0x0022693A]
But you don't want me.

Id: [0x0022693E]
Are you going to just stand there, or are you going to finish me off?

Id: [0x0022694C]
[&breath]There's nothing I want more right now, Thaletas. You're a brave warrior and a true Spartan. But I've seen the way you and Kyra look at each other.

Id: [0x0022694D]
You have honor. I feel ashamed.

Id: [0x00226962]
You don't fight like a Spartan. You fight like a god.

Id: [0x00226963]
[&breath]You're not so bad yourself.

Id: [0x0022696F]
Hmm, she was right. It's a very little sword.

Id: [0x0022699B]
What's your interest in the shipwreck[2105455]?

Id: [0x002269AD]
We've seen you watching us.

Id: [0x002269B2]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x002269B4]
I...

Id: [0x002269B5]
Don't be afraid. You're safe.

Id: [0x002269B7]
Thank you for saving my life. [Beat]Did you find anything?

Id: [0x002269B9]
I found this blade, covered in strange markings.

Id: [0x002269D0]
"Masked men." What kind of masks?

Id: [0x002269D1]
Uh, uh - white like marble, bleeding from their eyes. Horrific.

Id: [0x002269D3]
The Cult.

Id: [0x002269D4]
They control everything in Pephka... lure champions from all over with the promise of Minotaur-slaying glory, only to swindle and ambush them down here in the dark. Honorless.

Id: [0x002269DD]
If I don't do as they say, Amara dies. If I take off my mask, or tell my wife, or ask for help... she dies.

Id: [0x002269E4]
...One night the Masked Men took that joy from me. They needed my silver tongue to lure wealthy warriors to their Trials.

Id: [0x00226A14]
Kassandra… Kassandra… Kassandra.

Id: [0x00226A16]
May the father of understanding guide us… May the father of understanding guide us…

Id: [0x00226A1C]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00226A1E]
It was never supposed to be like this.

Id: [0x00226A20]
Decades ago, a group of people gathered together to uphold a theory which they believed could control the universe.

Id: [0x00226A22]
That the world functioned in equal parts, order and disorder.

Id: [0x00226A24]
But some fell lovingly into the wicked arms of chaos. And the Cult of Kosmos was born.

Id: [0x00226A26]
They abused their power, casting the Greek world into eternal war - one you were created to stop.

Id: [0x00226A28]
In destroying the Cult, you have done what I could not. You are a hero.

Id: [0x00226A2A]
But this imbalance comes with a price, my child.

Id: [0x00226A2C]
For without chaos, there is supreme order. A loss of progression and freedom.

Id: [0x00226A2D]
But there is still hope - hope in you, hope in the future you will bring.

Id: [0x00226A2F]
We must fix the mistakes of the past. Use the staff. Repair the rift in the universe.

Id: [0x00226A31]
The world depends on you, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00226A32]
You need to be the hero again.

Id: [0x00226A35]
We rule with chaos and destroy those who oppose us.

Id: [0x00226A3B]
<i>Oh my bones!</i> They are EXTREMELY broken. Don't be a fool - please, you must pay to skip this Pre-Trial!

Id: [0x00226A43]
By Zeus, my legs! If only I hadn't tried to fight the Trial Master. I should have paid him. I SHOULD HAVE PAID HIM!

Id: [0x00226A4A]
The pain! The incredible pain! My limbs and organs - crushed. If only I'd paid for the Trial Token. What an incredible, fairly priced deal!

Id: [0x00226A51]
HE CANNOT BE BEATEN! He's too strong. Your only logical choice is to purchase the Trial Token from him. Be wise, friend.

Id: [0x00226A58]
Put down your spear and grab your drachmae, challenger - for only honorable bribery can save you from sharing my astoundingly painful fate!

Id: [0x00226A61]
Are we on break now? My legs are <i>actually </i>starting to cramp.

Id: [0x00226A69]
This has got to be the best acting job in all the Greek world! Anyone got some olives?

Id: [0x00226A71]
By the Gods, the <i>misthios</i> actually beat him! Do we still get paid, or...?

Id: [0x00226A84]
Help! Please, help me. I-I'm trapped up here!

Id: [0x00226A89]
It's been hours. Where are they? Why'd I have to get malákes boys?! Boys! BOYS! Come home! ...Mikon?

Id: [0x00226A8F]
[laughs cheekily]You'll never fiiind meeee...!

Id: [0x00226A94]
Ouch... My arm!

Id: [0x00226A9A]
I'm not trapped - you can go away now. I'm not even in here!

Id: [0x00226AA0]
I DON'T NEED HELP!

Id: [0x00226AA2]
You're actually getting further away from me. I can't even hear you anymore. Oh no, where did you goooo?!

Id: [0x00226AA8]
Proof enough?

Id: [0x00226AAA]
Oh, my dear you don't disappoint. It's the little things that count.

Id: [0x00226AB8]
Stay away, potential champion. You have too much to live for... Only spending a quite affordable amount of drachmae can save your soul!

Id: [0x00226ABF]
You acted alone, and you will die alone.

Id: [0x00226AC0]
She's not your daughter anymore.

Id: [0x00226ADD]
Who among you is afraid?!

Id: [0x00226ADF]
Who among you is frail or weak?!

Id: [0x00226AE1]
Who among you... <i>IS STRONG?!</i>

Id: [0x00226AE3]
Then I say prove yourselves! Come face-to-face with He of the Blood-Soaked Hooves! He of the Entrail-Splattered Horns! You know his name, you know his roar! The Beast, the Myth... <i>THE MINOTAAAAAUR!!!</i>

Id: [0x00226AE5]
Maximum of three members per Minotaur hunting party; purchase of Minotaur-themed merchandise <i>is</i> mandatory before proceeding; no legendary warriors, pregnant heroes, or legitimate gods (demi, semi, or otherwise) are eligible to fight the Minotaur; and no pushing - you'll all get a chance at dismemberment.

Id: [0x00226AE9]
It is time to turn my words into actions.

Id: [0x00226AF1]
Well, he won't be needing this anymore.

Id: [0x00226B0F]
This sword is distinctly average, but she did ask for it.

Id: [0x00226B11]
Now to get the proof Aikaterine wanted.

Id: [0x00226B15]
I pray to you with all my heart that Kassandra doesn't scare off the animals with her heavy footsteps.

Id: [0x00226B17]
I thought I was being quiet.

Id: [0x00226B19]
If that was you being quiet, we'll have nothing but trampled grass to eat for dinner.

Id: [0x00226B1C]
Because I always hit <i>my</i> targets.

Id: [0x00226B1F]
Come. The ibex is swift. We're not going to catch any by standing and chatting.

Id: [0x00226B23]
Friends, I know you're angry. And you have the right to be - why do they hide in their houses and not quell the chaos that's come to Athens?

Id: [0x00226B24]
Understand Perikles is a sick man. Don't blame him for that. Blame him for bringing this curse that grips our once-great city.

Id: [0x00226B25]
Athens's name was once held high in the world. Now what has it become? Let's return Athens to greatness. We will be feared again!

Id: [0x00226B39]
[&breath]The flowers remind me of sweeter days.

Id: [0x00226B7D]
I'm looking for Kyra.

Id: [0x00226B7E]
Not here. Gone hunting. Wants you with her, she said.

Id: [0x00226B7F]
I'm in. Where is she?

Id: [0x00226B80]
Praying to the gods for a good hunt. The Altar of Artemis. East from here, on the north bit of Tavern Point.

Id: [0x00226B81]
Thanks.

Id: [0x00226B8A]
I have no idea what that meant.

Id: [0x00226B8B]
No, you don't.

Id: [0x00226B90]
You're a great hunter. Why did you actually want me here?

Id: [0x00226B91]
Don't be naive. There's something between us, even though I know I shouldn't act on it.

Id: [0x00226B92]
Because you love Thaletas.

Id: [0x00226B94]
And I always will.

Id: [0x00226B95]
You've been of great help to me, Kassandra, and for that I'm thankful. There is something between us, but it died when you gave me <i>pater's</i> doll in front of my people.

Id: [0x00226B99]
Take some with you. It's as much yours as it is mine.

Id: [0x00226BA3]
I didn't expect to see you.

Id: [0x00226BA8]
Thanks. But I'm not hungry.

Id: [0x00226BAE]
Thanks. But your people need it more than I do.

Id: [0x00226BBE]
You remind me of someone... Someone very special.

Id: [0x00226BC0]
I'll help you get your necklace.

Id: [0x00226BC1]
Why would you care?

Id: [0x00226C02]
You can't rely on me or others for help. You need to learn to solve your own problems.

Id: [0x00226C03]
Thanks for nothing, <i>maláka</i>!

Id: [0x00226C07]
The hunt clears my mind to reflect on the words that passed between us.

Id: [0x00226C08]
Is that a good thing?

Id: [0x00226C09]
I know a spot down by the water. It's quiet. We'd be alone. What do you say?

Id: [0x00226E24]
No!

Id: [0x00226E25]
My gods, what did you do?

Id: [0x00226E26]
He was so focused on me, he never noticed my spear in his leg. He was dead before he knew what happened.

Id: [0x00226E27]
His leg?

Id: [0x00226E2A]
Why is it so easy to talk with you?

Id: [0x00226E99]
Fair enough.

Id: [0x00226EB8]
Alexios...

Id: [0x00226EBC]
You are beautiful, and brave, and strong. The people of Delos are lucky to have you fighting for them.

Id: [0x00226EBE]
But us laying together wouldn't be right.

Id: [0x00226EC0]
To new friendships, then.

Id: [0x00226EC1]
To friendship.

Id: [0x00226EC4]
What did you need me to do?

Id: [0x00226EC5]
What do you want?

Id: [0x00226EC6]
Did you get my necklace from the Captain? Where are my friends? Did you help them? Was there a fight? Why are you standing there? Did you do <i>anything</i>?

Id: [0x00226EC7]
You want the drachmae.

Id: [0x00226EC8]
I don't care about the drachmae, not now. I need to save my family's legacy from the edge of a yet another champion's blade - I need to win and become like a hero of old.

Id: [0x00226ECC]
That's an impressive amount of work.

Id: [0x00226ECD]
If I don't win the battle, at least I'll know I've done all I can.

Id: [0x00226ED2]
Get my necklace and save my friends from the Captain... But you'll probably just disappoint me again.

Id: [0x00227181]
With the bow?

Id: [0x00227185]
Excellent shot!

Id: [0x00227189]
You're skilled with a bow.

Id: [0x0022718D]
Should keep our distance from that fort. Those targets shoot back.

Id: [0x00227191]
An Athenian camp.

Id: [0x00227195]
There's no ibexes here.

Id: [0x00227199]
Tell Artemis I've got my eye on someone else.

Id: [0x002271B4]
I'll take care of it.

Id: [0x002271B5]
You can count on me.

Id: [0x002271B6]
I'll help you. You have my word.

Id: [0x002271B7]
I'll handle this.

Id: [0x002271B8]
All right. I'm in.

Id: [0x002271BE]
Here, take this.

Id: [0x002271C0]
All right. Here it is.

Id: [0x002271C2]
Take this.

Id: [0x002271D3]
All right. I've got your back.

Id: [0x002271D5]
No one will lay a hand on you.

Id: [0x002271D7]
You'll be safe with me.

Id: [0x002271E3]
I got your message on the board. What's going on?

Id: [0x002271E5]
You left a note on the board. What's happened?

Id: [0x002271E7]
I'm here about the job you posted. What's going on?

Id: [0x002271E9]
You left a message on the board. What's the matter?

Id: [0x002271EB]
I picked up your message on the board. What's happening?

Id: [0x002271ED]
You left a note on the board. What's going on?

Id: [0x002271EF]
I've been looking for you... I saw your message. What's happened?

Id: [0x002271F1]
What's the matter?

Id: [0x002271F3]
What's going on?

Id: [0x002271F5]
What do you need?

Id: [0x002273F6]
<i>Misthios</i>! Over here.

Id: [0x00227404]
[sigh]Pephka, home of heroes.

Id: [0x00227412]
I told you nothing is what it seems in Pephka!

Id: [0x00227436]
Got all the fangs I'll ever need. I should return to the bowyer.

Id: [0x0022743A]
Hmm. A bow worthy of Artemis...

Id: [0x0022743C]
In Amara, they found all they needed to control me.

Id: [0x00227442]
This is Roxana's year. She's going to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands for sure.

Id: [0x00227443]
What? She doesn't even have an official training partner.

Id: [0x00227444]
It's because she's too good for any of them!

Id: [0x00227449]
Roxana nearly killed my son when they sparred this week.

Id: [0x0022744A]
He's lucky. Had it been in the Battle she <i>would </i>have killed him.

Id: [0x0022744B]
...Yeah.

Id: [0x00227455]
Her troops will need their mood lifted.

Id: [0x00227457]
I could tell them a tale or two - take their thoughts off things for a while.

Id: [0x002277F6]
And the crew? Ready to sail?

Id: [0x00227802]
Thank you for your help, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00227837]
"Podarkes, cruel leader of Delos Islands, takes money from our pockets and food from our mouths. All to feed his insate... insati..."

Id: [0x0022783C]
"We are a modest but fierce group of rebels, who'd pay you handsomely to help us overthrow our vile oppressor. I pray the winds guide you swiftly to our shores, <i>misthios.</i> Our people are dying." Signed "Kyra."

Id: [0x0022783E]
I should go. There's work to be done.

Id: [0x00227846]
All good warriors deserve their sendoff, I suppose. Even Podarkes.

Id: [0x00227847]
Pray that we're shown the same kindness when our time comes. [beat]In the meantime, there is wine to be drunk, and tales to be told.

Id: [0x00227848]
If Podarkes were my family, I'd have tied him to a tree and left him to rot.

Id: [0x00227849]
You and many others on Delos. [beat]But, this is still more celebration than funeral. There's wine to drink, and tales to tell.

Id: [0x0022785F]
Sorted our your drachmae troubles with Markos, did you?

Id: [0x00227867]
Good luck with your search.

Id: [0x0022786E]
How's that bow working for you? Its arrows'll be a real pain in the ass for your enemies.

Id: [0x0022787C]
See you at the party.

Id: [0x0022788A]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. I owe you my life.

Id: [0x00227898]
I was in your place, once. The vengeance dies, then the emptiness dies too. Give it time.

Id: [0x00227899]
Time! I gave my entire life. I want it done! Kronos devours his children - rips them flesh from bone. Zeus had Prometheus torn open by birds for an eternity. Fate is cruel, and the gods are wicked.

Id: [0x002278A4]
Sparta appreciates your help in bringing those thieves to justice.

Id: [0x002278AC]
Paros must be stopped.

Id: [0x002278B7]
Thanks for taking care of those ships, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002278C1]
We arrived just in time to help.

Id: [0x002278C2]
You see? Poseidon wasn't trying to drown you, he was getting you where you needed to go...

Id: [0x002278C4]
...aggressively.

Id: [0x002278CC]
Thank you for helping my brother.

Id: [0x002278D2]
Thanks for the tablet. I'll be seeing you soon.

Id: [0x002278DA]
I'm busy, and you shouldn't keep the Wolf waiting.

Id: [0x002278DE]
Get off my fucking ship.

Id: [0x002278E6]
You've got to be faster.

Id: [0x002278E7]
Roxana's going to kill him.

Id: [0x002278F4]
Found a ship of your own, did you? Guess this beauty will be helmed by another!

Id: [0x002278F7]
He's dead, and nothing we can do will bring him back.

Id: [0x002278F8]
We? <i>We</i> didn't kill him. You did. I had a chance to say goodbye to him and you took it from me. The gods demanded justice <i>from me</i>.

Id: [0x0022794A]
Ooh. That hurt.

Id: [0x0022796D]
Things are as they were. Phoibe's safe, and Markos's wine is still terrible.

Id: [0x0022799B]
He's gone, but you're still here. The people need you. If you don't protect them, there will be another Podarkes to come and take his place.

Id: [0x002279D8]
A fine speech.

Id: [0x002279DF]
Gods forbid we enjoy a single moment on this glorious beach.

Id: [0x00227A33]
You could have saved them. Kynna was my friend...

Id: [0x00227A37]
I knew you'd help. Thank you for saving my friend Kynna.

Id: [0x00227A3C]
I need to know where to find them.

Id: [0x00227A3D]
Kyra's spies tracked all three of them. One guards the quarry[2379694]. One's camped nearby.

Id: [0x00227AC8]
You've solved the mystery. Time for me to find the <i>real</i> gods.

Id: [0x00227AD1]
Your friend didn't make it. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00227AD2]
Maybe it's better that way...

Id: [0x00227AE6]
We owe you everything.

Id: [0x00227AE7]
I wanna keep the necklace. Don't you think it would look nice on me?

Id: [0x00227B1C]
Tomorrow is a new day. Korinth will be reborn.

Id: [0x00227B24]
Where can I find the records you're looking for?

Id: [0x00227B25]
I'll need a lot of evidence to find the person behind The Dagger - one set of records won't be enough.

Id: [0x00227B26]
The local magistrate is my master, and I'm his most trusted servant.

Id: [0x00227B37]
...If the Minotaur eats humans <i>and</i> lives right next to the population of Pephka, how are they all still alive?

Id: [0x00227B38]
Perhaps the diet of Pephkans disagrees with him?

Id: [0x00227B39]
Good thinking, brother! Let us dip our blades in  rich oils and onions to gain an edge in combat!

Id: [0x00227B3B]
I hear the Minotaur was slain by Theseus.

Id: [0x00227B3C]
Impossible! If Theseus killed the Minotaur, how can it be here?

Id: [0x00227B3E]
Not all have the luxury of choice, friend.

Id: [0x00227B73]
I've found the records, Agapios.

Id: [0x00227B78]
Welcome to the Warrior's Rest - the last stop before the terrifying Minotaur! This is your final chance to turn and flee, misthios! And, I very, very strongly suggest you do - for none have survived him!

Id: [0x00227B7F]
If uncovering the identity of The Dagger's leader and finally stopping them sounds like something you'd be interested in, meet me and my master in the Slave Market.

Id: [0x00227B81]
You'll find the beast in the depths of the Cave of the Brave on the Dikte Plateau. Two other warriors have just completed their Pre-Trials - you can speak to them for more information.

Id: [0x00227B82]
You've come all this way - join us.

Id: [0x00227B84]
[&laughs]No, no, no, no. I have a very important... pottery lesson to attend! So...[&ahem][clears throat][/&ahem]

Id: [0x00227B8F]
Brother! Wait! There's more glory in beast-slaying that in bread-making!

Id: [0x00227B91]
<b><i>ROOOOOOOOAR!!!</i></b>

Id: [0x00227B93]
<b><i>ROOOOOOOOAR!!!</i></b>

Id: [0x00227B97]
Exactly. I don't blame my father for selling me into slavery, it's what he had to do. It got me out of my old life, and gave me a chance at a better one.

Id: [0x00227B9D]
The Minotaur is a mythical creature - only someone just as mythical could slay it.

Id: [0x00227B9F]
...You're talking about me, right?

Id: [0x00227BA0]
The only "myths" about you, little brother, are the ones pater paid to keep quiet.

Id: [0x00227BA8]
The killing blow will go to the warrior with the greatest skill and courage in battle.

Id: [0x00227BA9]
Then I shall wear the Minotaur's entrails as my <i>necklace</i>!

Id: [0x00227BB0]
[&ah]This can only end well.

Id: [0x00227BB2]
Let's slay a Minotaur.

Id: [0x00227BB3]
Leiandros says it lives in the Cave of the Brave, on the Dikte Plateau. I say let the Mino-tournament BEGIN!

Id: [0x00227BB5]
Are you ready to ride?

Id: [0x00227BB8]
..<i>.Grr! </i>[beat]I said GRRR!!!

Id: [0x00227BDD]
Records of the trades Euboea's made in the last 6 months. Maybe the identity of The Dagger's leader is in here?

Id: [0x00227BFB]
Good luuuuuuck!

Id: [0x00227CD7]
Huh?

Id: [0x00227CD9]
Did something happen to your shipment?

Id: [0x00227CDB]
Did you say something, whelp?

Id: [0x00227CDC]
I said "curse those clumsy fools!"

Id: [0x00227CDD]
Exactly.

Id: [0x00227CDE]
Now I need more obsidian. If you can bring me some, misthios, my finest blade shall be yours. [beat]Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x00227CDF]
Did she say -

Id: [0x00227CE0]
She sure did, boss!

Id: [0x00227CE1]
Idiot.

Id: [0x00227CE2]
Wonderful. My apprentice here will tell you where to find the obsidian.

Id: [0x00227CE3]
Thanks for doing this, 'else he wouldn't have shut up. There are stashes of the stuff in the Temple of Britomartis and the Sunken Ruins.

Id: [0x00227CE4]
You were carrying it too.

Id: [0x00227CE6]
Uh, she said no, boss.

Id: [0x00227CE8]
You need a real blade! That toothpick of yours won't get you far. Come back if you change your mind.

Id: [0x00227CE9]
Excellent! This will do fine. Here you go, misthios. As promised.

Id: [0x00227CEE]
Return if you change your mind, <i>misthios</i>. We need that obsidian.

Id: [0x00227CF1]
She got the stuff.

Id: [0x00227CF2]
Well done, misthios. [beat]Take my blade. May it serve you well.

Id: [0x00227CF8]
If you have any questions, point them at me. I've had enough of his booming voice for one day.

Id: [0x00227CF9]
These ruins you mentioned, where are they?

Id: [0x00227CFC]
Tell me where to find it.

Id: [0x00227CFD]
The Temple of Britomartis is northwest of Kydonia. But there are guards roaming about - be careful.

Id: [0x00227CFE]
I've got all I need. I'll be back with the obsidian glass.

Id: [0x00227D01]
She's going to get your stuff now.

Id: [0x00227D02]
Wonderful. Return quickly, misthios.

Id: [0x00227D0C]
This must be where they keep the obsidian glass.

Id: [0x00227D11]
The obsidian glass must be here for a reason. Better be on my guard.

Id: [0x00227D16]
The Sunken Ruins are on the west coast of Messara. Fair warning, though - they're infested with sharks.

Id: [0x00227D18]
Good to know.

Id: [0x00227D1C]
She put up a real fight back there.

Id: [0x00227D21]
[&ah]This island has a giant history, my friend.

Id: [0x00227D30]
My mind wandered. Remind me what the note said?

Id: [0x00227D32]
Podarkes... Cruel leader... Thirst for power... Pay you <i>handsomely</i>... Rebellion... People dying.

Id: [0x00227D39]
These islands are even more beautiful than the stories tell.

Id: [0x00227D41]
It's time I met with this Kyra.

Id: [0x00227D44]
True wisdom lies not in knowing what to say, but in knowing when to say nothing at all.

Id: [0x00227D4B]
That was Kephallonia, and that was mostly your fault.

Id: [0x00227D4C]
I'll have the ship ready in case we need any... [&ahem]immediate departures.

Id: [0x00227D5D]
Even in this weather, this place is beautiful. It's easy to forget.

Id: [0x00227D60]
Kephallonia - <i>ugh. </i>It's truly no Athens.

Id: [0x00227D8B]
Only with the spear of Kephalos is the sanctuary a proper temple.

Id: [0x00227D95]
[&ah]You taught those thugs a lesson of a lifetime.

Id: [0x00227D96]
They won't be coming back here anytime soon.

Id: [0x00227D9C]
Even if you haven't found Anthousa, you've found me.

Id: [0x00227DA2]
Still nothing to see here. Don't you worry.

Id: [0x00227DBE]
So you need me to get it from the soldiers.

Id: [0x00227DC5]
There's nothing scarier than the unknown, and you've protected me from it. Thank you.

Id: [0x00227DC6]
A few wolves shouldn't be much trouble.

Id: [0x00227DC7]
These wolves were trained to be part of the Battle of One Hundred Hands, to <i>attack</i> and kill people. We can't have them running loose on Hydrea.

Id: [0x00227DC8]
I see.

Id: [0x00227DC9]
We sure helped Damalis! And it was kind of fun, too.

Id: [0x00227DD3]
We can't have so many wolves on an island this small. They'll terrorize the people living here.

Id: [0x00227DD4]
That's exactly right, <i>misthios</i>. That's why we're here.

Id: [0x00227DD9]
Nothing like a sea breeze!

Id: [0x00227DDA]
Does the deck always feel like it's moving?

Id: [0x00227DDC]
[&laughs]I've got the perfect opportunity for you to get your sea legs.

Id: [0x00227DDD]
Oh, what would that be?

Id: [0x00227DEB]
Well, when the Cyclops was giving me a drumming, his pirates took my cargo. I know their ship, and I know where they're heading. What say we get it back?

Id: [0x00227DEC]
Sure. It'll be a good opportunity to see how your ship and crew perform.

Id: [0x00227DF0]
There she is!

Id: [0x00227DFA]
Sink that ship to release the cargo!

Id: [0x00227E00]
A good catch! That cargo's ours now.

Id: [0x00227E0C]
Well, at least I got to see Odysseus's palace[2425521]... As underwhelming as it was.

Id: [0x00227E1B]
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

Id: [0x00227E23]
It's nice to be out here, just the two of us.

Id: [0x00227E24]
Is that right?

Id: [0x00227E25]
There were a lot of onlookers when we sparred.

Id: [0x00227E26]
You'll be happy to know, the rest of our training will be more... private.

Id: [0x00227E29]
You're a unique creature, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00227E58]
A soldier told me you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227E5F]
A commander said you needed this.

Id: [0x00227E61]
A sophist wanted you to have this.

Id: [0x00227E63]
A hunter told me you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227E65]
A spy told me this was for you.

Id: [0x00227E67]
A scientist told me you could use this.

Id: [0x00227E6A]
Delivery for you - from a blacksmith.

Id: [0x00227E6C]
The physician said you'd be needing this.

Id: [0x00227E6E]
Someone on the docks said you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227E77]
A worker in the mines said this was for you.

Id: [0x00227E79]
A musician told me you needed this.

Id: [0x00227E7B]
Delivery for you, from a farmer.

Id: [0x00227E7D]
A writer told me you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227E7F]
A merchant told me you'd want this.

Id: [0x00227E81]
A fisher wanted you to have this.

Id: [0x00227E83]
Delivery for you, from the baker.

Id: [0x00227E85]
An artist told me you'd need this.

Id: [0x00227E87]
Important delivery for you - from a politician.

Id: [0x00227E8B]
Delivery for you - from an outlaw. Careful.

Id: [0x00227E8D]
An athlete I met wanted you to have this.

Id: [0x00227E91]
A scavenger told me you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227E93]
A mercenary told me this is for you.

Id: [0x00227E98]
Thank you for bringing those medical supplies to my master, Hippokrates. Be in good health!

Id: [0x00227E9F]
Look at you, all statuesque as you draw your bow.

Id: [0x00227EA3]
A man told me you needed this.

Id: [0x00227EA5]
The herbalist told me you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227EA7]
A priestess told me you'd want this.

Id: [0x00227EA9]
A woman told me you'd be expecting this.

Id: [0x00227EAB]
A midwife wanted you to have this.

Id: [0x00227EB2]
A Daughter of Artemis told me to bring this to you.

Id: [0x00227EB4]
A... witch wanted you to have this.

Id: [0x00227EB6]
Delivery for you, from a hetaera.

Id: [0x00227F74]
Thank you for finding the one who would kill me. Please... show such kindness to Chrysis.

Id: [0x00228186]
I was, but that was a long time ago.

Id: [0x00228187]
Spartan blood is eternal, stranger. What's your name?

Id: [0x0022818C]
You there, <i>misthios</i>! Fight by my side!

Id: [0x0022818E]
I told you to be careful with it.

Id: [0x0022818F]
What did you say?

Id: [0x00228190]
Nothing. You're absolutely perfect, boss.

Id: [0x0022852B]
<i>Misthios</i>, please. I could use your help.

Id: [0x00228530]
Sail alongside the cargo to haul it aboard.

Id: [0x00228532]
Ha! Well, you fight and talk like one. What do they call you, warrior?

Id: [0x0022853A]
Forget where I'm from. [beat]I'm looking for a rebel named Kyra.

Id: [0x0022853B]
And who are you?

Id: [0x0022853E]
What seems to be the problem?

Id: [0x00228541]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00228542]
Our ship was sunk. Our generals killed. There are only a few of us left.

Id: [0x00228547]
There is serious unrest in Kydonia, misthios. The guards and merchants are at each other's throats.

Id: [0x00228548]
The guards are here to serve the locals... What's got them riled up?

Id: [0x0022854C]
You're food for the sharks now, Athenians!

Id: [0x00228551]
Thaletas sends his regards, Athenian scum!

Id: [0x00228561]
Thaletas's helmet.

Id: [0x00228567]
I must transcribe Hippokrates's lost notes. I just hope I can remember everything...

Id: [0x00228573]
By Ares, that should do it! Though, if we sink more, the Athenian forces will crumble.

Id: [0x00228575]
Forgive me, <i>misthios</i>. There are many who still need my help.

Id: [0x00228578]
Thanks for the supplies, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022858D]
Taxes. The merchants refuse to pay the increased taxes, and the guards all too gleefully extract them.

Id: [0x00228590]
Which would be seriously rewarded. I have precious gems, which I'm sure would appeal to someone such as yourself.

Id: [0x0022859C]
I'm busy. You'll have to find someone else.

Id: [0x0022859D]
Lives are at stake, <i>misthios</i>! You can't just ignore this. Please reconsider.

Id: [0x002285AF]
I'd be happy to help.

Id: [0x002285B0]
Good. You will find areas of tension around the agora, the eastern market, and the docks. Is there anything else I can tell you?

Id: [0x002285B2]
I've heard everything I need to hear.

Id: [0x002285BD]
Ram them from the side, and cleave that ship in two!

Id: [0x002285C9]
Kassandra! I knew you'd be back for more. I can't say it hasn't been on my mind... But, alas, we must save it for another time.

Id: [0x002285CD]
Kassandra! I knew you'd change your mind after turning me down. Unfortunately, love must wait a little longer...

Id: [0x002285CF]
I hate to cut our conversation short, Sokrates, but I believe you've talked enough for the both of us. We <i>must </i>find another use for that mouth of yours.

Id: [0x002285EC]
Speak to him long enough, and you may find the smallest hint of knowledge veiled deep behind his... enthusiastic advances.

Id: [0x002285EE]
How do we get past his guards?

Id: [0x002285EF]
We'll make a sailor out of you yet.

Id: [0x002285F9]
All right there, let's get moving!

Id: [0x002287F5]
A trail of flowers? He wouldn't.

Id: [0x002287F7]
All right. I was never here.

Id: [0x002287F9]
Fine. I never saw you.

Id: [0x002287FE]
Let's see how the sails have held up.

Id: [0x0022880F]
Return to me once you've calmed the pockets of tension throughout Kydonia. But perhaps you have more questions?

Id: [0x00228A0C]
Maybe you could disappear another way... Like aboard my ship?

Id: [0x00228C09]
I might be able to help you escape... [beat]If you're willing to join my crew?

Id: [0x00228C0B]
Have you come back to help me to quell the unrest that infects Kydonia?

Id: [0x00228DD6]
A compliment and an insult in the same sentence. He truly <i>is</i> gifted.

Id: [0x00228DD7]
I lost a couple good men in the scrap with those pirates. The seas are more dangerous now that Sparta and Athens are at each other's throats.

Id: [0x00228DD8]
We need new recruits to better our crew...

Id: [0x00228E27]
Scouts reported Podarkes's supplies and weapons were stockpiled in the old ruins[2347407] on Delos Island.

Id: [0x00228FD5]
The Pythia's decrees are exhausting.

Id: [0x00228FD6]
I'm too old for this…

Id: [0x00228FDB]
I know where to start - the best archer I know, he'd be a valuable asset.

Id: [0x00229088]
What's going on here?

Id: [0x00229089]
This <i>maláka</i> needs to pay his taxes like everyone else. Otherwise, we'll smash every last pot in the agora - Captain Diokles's orders.

Id: [0x00229090]
Take care of yourself, Eagle Bearer. Don't do anything I wouldn't do!

Id: [0x00229095]
When can we meet him?

Id: [0x0022909A]
I should watch my step.

Id: [0x002290A6]
Leave the merchant alone. You've done enough.

Id: [0x002290A7]
Ha! You itching for a beating, <i>misthios</i>? We'll just have to smash you, too.

Id: [0x002290AC]
Well... You're going to have to <i>persuade</i> him.

Id: [0x002290AD]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002290AE]
You get him aboard, and I'll talk him into it... A little drachmae should sweeten the deal.

Id: [0x002290AF]
So, you want me to... knock him out.

Id: [0x002290B0]
No, no. Well, maybe just pacify him a little. Then get him to the ship, so we can have a little talk. [beat]Everything will be fine, I promise you.

Id: [0x002290B8]
...If that's what it takes to stop this, I'll destroy the rest of the wares.

Id: [0x002290B9]
Looks like you know your place, little <i>misthios</i>. Now, get to it.

Id: [0x002290BD]
Soldiers die - it's what they do. I can help fight, but first I need to find Kyra.

Id: [0x002290BE]
[&laughs]I like you, warrior. The rebel hideout[2315766] is an underground cave, southwest of here. I'll meet you there.

Id: [0x002290C2]
Behold, I've kept myself alive.

Id: [0x002290C4]
It was the one job I gave you, Sokrates. I knew you could handle it.

Id: [0x002290C5]
I would have attempted it even if you hadn't told me to.

Id: [0x002290C6]
Then let's pay tribute to them. Though they aren't here now, they were here once. Come with me.

Id: [0x002290C9]
My opinion on death is a nebulous one, because I know nothing about it. Therefore, I know I shouldn't be afraid.

Id: [0x002290CA]
I'm not afraid, either.

Id: [0x002290CB]
Many are, because they don't know what death holds for them. One can only trust that the gods know for certain.

Id: [0x002290D0]
We've all lost friends to this war. We can mourn together, but first I need to find Kyra.

Id: [0x0022913E]
That's the island. You'll need to be cautious - it'll be crawling with pirates.

Id: [0x00229142]
That's my target.

Id: [0x00229146]
I should send Ikaros up to get the lay of the land. He'll spot my target.

Id: [0x0022914D]
[&ah]You fought well, Kyra.

Id: [0x0022915A]
I was, but that was a long time ago.

Id: [0x0022915B]
Spartan blood is eternal, stranger. What's your name?

Id: [0x0022915E]
Not Spartan. Just deadly.

Id: [0x0022915F]
Ha! Well you fight and talk like one. What do they call you, warrior?

Id: [0x00229161]
This is Kassandra. The one I told you about.

Id: [0x00229162]
They call me Thaletas. I was polemarch to the Spartans here.

Id: [0x00229163]
Was?

Id: [0x00229164]
Our ship was sunk. Our generals killed. There are only a few of us left.

Id: [0x0022916A]
Soldiers die - it's what they do.

Id: [0x0022916F]
We've all lost friends to this war.

Id: [0x0022917A]
You too. Spartan?

Id: [0x0022917C]
I treated her like a child.

Id: [0x0022917D]
With the intent to protect her. You were not only her friend, but her guardian.

Id: [0x0022917F]
[&breath]She never got to be a little girl. [&breath]I talked to her like she was already grown up.

Id: [0x00229180]
Which you did out of respect for her. Question your choices, Kassandra, but never doubt them.

Id: [0x00229185]
Nothing but a tablet. I wonder what it says?

Id: [0x0022918A]
So, the light beams are the key...

Id: [0x0022918F]
There. That should work. Now to try the door.

Id: [0x00229196]
It's locked. I should check the tablet again.

Id: [0x00229198]
Thank you for giving her the burial she deserved.

Id: [0x00229199]
There are countless others here, in Elysium. The blessed have earned that eternal happiness. One of them is our great Perikles.

Id: [0x0022919A]
Athens owes him a debt for all he's done.

Id: [0x0022919F]
Finally. Now, to find what lies within.

Id: [0x002291C6]
Good, he'll be a valuable asset to the crew.

Id: [0x002291C8]
I got him.

Id: [0x002291E3]
This place is huge.

Id: [0x00229201]
That was a close one.

Id: [0x00229214]
Why would my father be here?

Id: [0x00229218]
And suddenly, you show up.

Id: [0x00229240]
It didn't go well - I had to kill him.

Id: [0x00229242]
Maybe we won't try for a pirate next time.

Id: [0x00229245]
Something tells me we're going to need them.

Id: [0x0022924F]
It's hot in here.

Id: [0x00229255]
What is this place?

Id: [0x00229258]
Someone say Sparta?

Id: [0x0022925A]
[&breath]You're alive.

Id: [0x0022925B]
How are your men?

Id: [0x0022925C]
Alive as well, thanks to you.

Id: [0x0022925F]
You've met. Good. Now that we're all friends, we need a plan.

Id: [0x0022926D]
Kyra... He's gone. Your rebels are waiting.

Id: [0x00229270]
Goodbye, <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x00229271]
What will you do next? Mykonos will need to rebuild.

Id: [0x00229272]
Then that's what we'll do. But not to put it back as it was... not as <i>pater</i> wanted. We'll make this place a new home for our people to be free. To live good lives.

Id: [0x00229276]
Did Sparta answer your call for help?

Id: [0x00229277]
A polemarch named Thaletas and a handful of Spartans landed on Mykonos not long before you.

Id: [0x0022927A]
It's their camp we're headed to, isn't it?

Id: [0x0022927B]
Thaletas needs <i>our</i> help now, though he'd never admit it.

Id: [0x0022927C]
Sounds Spartan all right.

Id: [0x0022927E]
They're celebrating. [&breath]Let's celebrate with them.

Id: [0x0022927F]
If the gods are displeased, offer them a sacrifice.

Id: [0x00229281]
A sacrifice... What do I have left that they haven't taken from me?

Id: [0x00229285]
Right here, right now, all that matters are the people who have fought for you. They need you now - not the gods.

Id: [0x00229288]
People gave their lives for you, Kyra. I nearly gave my own. The gods have blessed you, and you don't even see it.

Id: [0x0022928A]
<i>No one</i> can see what the gods do. They tricked me into wanting him dead. They tormented my thoughts until I could think of nothing else. And now, I see them laughing at me.

Id: [0x0022928C]
Her? Who?

Id: [0x0022928D]
Curse our cruel gods. I will see you, <i>mater</i>. [beat]And <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x0022928E]
Kyra! Stop!

Id: [0x00229290]
No shame. No pain. We will be together again.

Id: [0x00229292]
Kyra!

Id: [0x00229294]
Kyra, stop. You're too close to the edge.

Id: [0x00229295]
Nothing. All of this was for nothing. I'm a rebel with nothing left to rebel against. It didn't bring her back.

Id: [0x00229296]
What?

Id: [0x00229297]
This glory was supposed to be mine, but you took everything from me. You took Podarkes. You took these islands. You took Kyra, my love!

Id: [0x0022929A]
This glory was supposed to be mine. Podarkes was mine to kill. These islands were mine to win for Sparta. You were mine, and Kyra took you from me!

Id: [0x0022929E]
Be reasonable, Thaletas.

Id: [0x002292A0]
No one belongs to you, Thaletas. I didn't take your glory, I helped you.

Id: [0x002292A2]
You did nothing! [beat]We were in love, you know. We can be again... I can still have her heart, still prove to her I'm the warrior she wants.

Id: [0x002292A7]
It was one night, Thaletas.

Id: [0x002292A8]
But... after everything you said to me, everything we shared, I thought...

Id: [0x002292AA]
Sparta's that way. Just past the crests of the waves. I can almost hear her singing us home.

Id: [0x002292AE]
I don't sail by anyone's side, Thaletas. You know that by now.

Id: [0x002292B0]
If you wanted true glory, true freedom, you are welcome to join me on the Adrestia.

Id: [0x002292B1]
You have my love, Kassandra, but Sparta has my heart. Perhaps, one day...

Id: [0x002292B7]
I'd love to join you, if I could. But you're a Spartan general now, and I have my own destiny.

Id: [0x002292B9]
I know it's crazy. But I came to these islands expecting nothing but death.

Id: [0x002292BC]
[&breath][[sighs]][/&breath]My troops are going to start looking for me soon. I'll see you at the celebration.

Id: [0x002292C7]
A mere technicality! A "fang bow" sounds better.

Id: [0x002292CF]
I found these.

Id: [0x002292D2]
Wonderful! Though I'll need more evidence if I'm to track down the leader of The Dagger.

Id: [0x002292D6]
I found this.

Id: [0x00229305]
But I'm too old to be breaking into guarded warehouses. Perhaps the shine on my drachmae can convince you to do it for me?

Id: [0x0022932B]
You! After I killed the bear, I thought you were itching to get off Delos.

Id: [0x0022932D]
Me too. But I met someone, and...

Id: [0x00229332]
I owe you my life.

Id: [0x00229334]
You two try to behave yourselves.

Id: [0x00229336]
You're still going back to Arkadia?

Id: [0x00229337]
Not sure. Fates'll change, and you gotta change with 'em. The smuggler life is over for me, but I don't have a plan.

Id: [0x0022933F]
They didn't call him the "first citizen of Athens" for nothing. A man of many contributions, but also a private man.

Id: [0x0022934C]
Hey, thief!

Id: [0x0022934E]
[&breath]If only he had shared his burden...

Id: [0x0022934F]
We only knew him as he presented himself to be, but who's to say that wasn't his true self?

Id: [0x00229351]
He had to keep to himself. He was always being pursued by something or someone.

Id: [0x00229352]
By protecting himself, he was protecting Athens from ruin. Aspasia may have been the only one who truly knew him.

Id: [0x0022935A]
[&breath]This war has taken so many. [&breath]Even Brasidas fell.

Id: [0x0022935B]
Maybe so. But as a Spartan, he fulfilled his duty and died on the battlefield.

Id: [0x0022935C]
The people will remember how we brought down Kleon.

Id: [0x00229361]
My favorite <i>misthios</i> returns.

Id: [0x0022936A]
Stay safe, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00229375]
I heard Kleon was found on the beach - massacred, no less.

Id: [0x00229378]
Apparently soldiers found Kleon on the beach. A casualty of war, perhaps?

Id: [0x00229379]
Couldn't say. It's hard to recall what happens in the heat of battle.

Id: [0x0022937C]
So, what will you do once Podarkes is dead and the rebellion is won?

Id: [0x0022937D]
The sad truth is I have no idea. For as long as I can remember, every day has been a struggle. To live, to laugh... Vengeance has all but consumed me.

Id: [0x0022937F]
Either way, let him spend his eternity in Tartarus for what he's done. And be certain our friends wait for us in the light.

Id: [0x00229380]
I'd drink to that.

Id: [0x00229381]
Who am I to say no?

Id: [0x0022939A]
Well, this has supplied me with plenty of new material for my next play.

Id: [0x0022939B]
There's been no love scene yet! [beat]Let me provide that inspiration now.

Id: [0x0022939C]
Beauty is short-lived. You may as well use it, Alkibiades.

Id: [0x0022939D]
And to that, I raise my drink.

Id: [0x002293B1]
You've arrived at the perfect time. I have a friend named Sophanes who wants to become an Athenian citizen, but he needs a bit of help. <i>Your</i> help.

Id: [0x002293B9]
And what will Kassandra do once this is over?

Id: [0x002293BE]
What's in here?

Id: [0x002293C8]
Once Podarkes's supplies on Delos are destroyed, we can plan our next attack.

Id: [0x002293D4]
I'm afraid I haven't had enough wine for <i>that</i>, Alkibiades.

Id: [0x002293D5]
Then someone fill his cup!

Id: [0x002293DB]
Podarkes's troops will be helpless.

Id: [0x002293EA]
This should cripple Podarkes's defenses.

Id: [0x002293EF]
The soldiers' weapons. Don't mind if I do.

Id: [0x002293F4]
Podarkes thought he was clever hiding weapons on Delos.

Id: [0x002293F9]
A supply crate. Should destroy these without attracting attention.

Id: [0x00229400]
Who knew rebelling was this much fun?

Id: [0x00229405]
Athenian wine. I'm sure Kyra would enjoy this. Come to think of it, so would I.

Id: [0x00229409]
Break their supplies, break their will.

Id: [0x0022940F]
Thanks for saving us from the Athenian. Now we get to keep everything we steal!

Id: [0x00229418]
Life is only worth living if we spend our time examining our choices, wouldn't you agree?

Id: [0x00229419]
Relax, and enjoy your time in this world. There is nothing more barren than a busy life.

Id: [0x0022941A]
My intent is never to fill your head as one fills a cup with wine, but to ignite in you a flame that will burn brightly on its own.

Id: [0x0022941B]
Only by accepting you know nothing at all, can one truly know wisdom.

Id: [0x00229423]
It's not as easy as it seems - staying alive. There's not many of us left.

Id: [0x0022942C]
[&breath]Phoibe.

Id: [0x00229443]
Why not enjoy the celebration a while?

Id: [0x0022944D]
Maybe I'll come back later.

Id: [0x0022944F]
And with good news, too.

Id: [0x00229452]
No one's perfect.

Id: [0x00229454]
Your destiny is to free the people of Delos. I still have my own to fulfill, far from here.

Id: [0x00229457]
As long as there's war, there's always work for a <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022945A]
We have a lot in common. I was hoping when the smoke clears, we could find somewhere quiet.

Id: [0x0022945B]
And what exactly do we have in common?

Id: [0x00229460]
My favorite kind. You did it then?

Id: [0x00229474]
I just... We... I just thought that's what people said to each other. I wasn't expecting a follow up.

Id: [0x00229476]
[&laughs]The mighty Kassandra, caught off her guard!

Id: [0x0022947B]
Relax. A moment together would be nice.

Id: [0x0022947D]
You fight with such passion. I keep forgetting you're only here for the money.

Id: [0x0022947E]
Of course. I will always remember what you've done for us. And if the gods will it, I can one day help you.

Id: [0x0022947F]
I've seen you with a blade. You have a skill that could only come from the pleasures of battle.

Id: [0x00229480]
Podarkes and his troops force me into battle. I take no pleasure in it. My dreams are of peace, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00229484]
I know you've struggled to get where you are. You've had to fight and claw for everything you have. I know... because I've done the same.

Id: [0x00229485]
We're survivors. I'm glad the gods brought you to our shores, Kassandra. Some time alone would be nice. You must have many tales.

Id: [0x00229488]
It's time we got going. When Podarkes learns of what happened on Delos, he'll want revenge.

Id: [0x00229489]
And the first to suffer will be the Delians.

Id: [0x002294A3]
It was no worse than what he would have done to his own people. I had to follow through.

Id: [0x002294A9]
As long as I made a profit, I'm happy. Now pay me.

Id: [0x002294BD]
I can't wait to hear why it's <i>my</i> help he needs.

Id: [0x002294BE]
Any <i>misthios </i>would do, really, but <i>you're</i> my favorite. All you need to do is sign my friend's name on a little list.

Id: [0x002294C0]
There has to be a reason Sophanes can't sign the list himself.

Id: [0x002294C1]
Well, he would, but he isn't nearly as... <i>able</i> as you are.

Id: [0x002294C2]
Meaning?

Id: [0x002294C3]
Meaning you have skills he doesn't possess. He'd fail if he tried on his own.

Id: [0x002294C4]
I didn't realize you had a list of mercenaries you favor... And I'm at the top?

Id: [0x002294C5]
Of course you are. [beat]Although, if you ask nicely, I would happily let you be on the bottom.

Id: [0x002294C6]
This sounds simple. Now tell me why it isn't.

Id: [0x002294C7]
There's the small matter that you'll have to enter the Metroon, where you're not allowed... And forge his name well enough, of course.

Id: [0x002294C8]
So he's trying to become a citizen illegally. You should have led with that.

Id: [0x002294C9]
I'll try to remember that next time. The building you're looking for is near the agora. Be safe.

Id: [0x002294CC]
Why Athens? Surely he is a citizen somewhere else already.

Id: [0x002294CD]
Everyone wants to be an Athenian citizen, even if they don't say so. Sophanes has a mind for politics, but can only participate as a citizen.

Id: [0x002294CE]
They had him, and you saved him!

Id: [0x002294CF]
That lunati... [&ahem][[clears throat]][/&ahem]rebel was your pater?

Id: [0x002294D4]
Thank you for freeing me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002294D8]
Of course I did. Sophanes's name is now on the citizen list.

Id: [0x002294D9]
Perfect! I knew you were the right <i>misthios </i>for the job.

Id: [0x002294F7]
Hello?

Id: [0x002294FE]
Ikaros!

Id: [0x00229510]
I've come to fulfil my destiny.

Id: [0x00229511]
Oh, you have? And what would that be, young one?

Id: [0x00229512]
I was hoping you'd tell me.

Id: [0x00229513]
Atlantis doesn't give up its secrets easily.

Id: [0x00229533]
This place is like a tomb. How did you live down here, and for so long?

Id: [0x00229537]
This artifact, like your spear, possesses incredible power. It has given me life so that I may continue to learn from this place.

Id: [0x00229539]
What have you been studying here?

Id: [0x0022953C]
Everything. The First Civilization's history, their culture, their science... With it, we can change humanity's destiny and usher in an age of enlightenment.

Id: [0x0022953D]
Destiny is something only the gods can alter.

Id: [0x0022953F]
I believe it was a city long ago, a place where beings of great knowledge and power lived before humankind had built even its first primitive settlements.

Id: [0x00229553]
Why was I sent here? What's my role in all of this? I want answers!

Id: [0x00229554]
There is knowledge in this place. Powerful knowledge.

Id: [0x00229555]
I don't understand any of this. I'm a warrior, not a scholar.

Id: [0x00229556]
We all have a purpose, Kassandra. Yours was to help me protect the secrets of Atlantis.

Id: [0x00229565]
Why should I help you? You were never there for me.

Id: [0x00229566]
You endured what you had to in order to be strong enough for what's to come.

Id: [0x00229569]
I never asked for any of this.

Id: [0x0022956A]
Our destiny is a burden we must shoulder. It is not something we choose.

Id: [0x0022956B]
What would you have me do?

Id: [0x0022956D]
You're right. We must save the Greek world from itself.

Id: [0x00229570]
Above all things, trust yourself. You're capable of greatness.

Id: [0x00229571]
I'll do my best.

Id: [0x00229573]
The answers I seek are behind these mechanisms. They are sealed, and the artifacts to open them are missing.

Id: [0x00229574]
So I need to find the artifacts and return them to Atlantis?

Id: [0x00229575]
I've collected information that hints at where these artifacts may be located.

Id: [0x00229577]
However, they are incredibly powerful. They corrupt the minds of lesser people and possess a will to defend themselves.

Id: [0x002295A1]
It's good to see you, Kyra.

Id: [0x002295AB]
Kassandra! Great to see you celebrating. But where's Kyra?

Id: [0x002295B3]
Since you came here, I've actually started to believe we can win this rebellion. So... you were saying we strike?

Id: [0x002295B5]
The Athenians are weak. Now we strike Podarkes where he'll hurt most.

Id: [0x002295B6]
His kidneys?

Id: [0x002295B7]
Delos keeps its wealth in one place, under constant guard. We steal it, and the soldiers will go unpaid, unfed, and unarmed. Podarkes will be vulnerable.

Id: [0x002295B8]
Then we can stick our blades in between his ribs... Feed his liver to the dogs.

Id: [0x002295B9]
Before we start feeding organs to animals, can you get me to the nation's purse?

Id: [0x002295BA]
Our spies have located it in Miltiades Fort. I'll have Praxos gather the troops.

Id: [0x002295BB]
It's best if it's just the two of us. Easier to sneak in and out undetected.

Id: [0x002295C3]
Now that you've forged my friend's name on the citizen's list, there's one more thing that needs to be done.

Id: [0x002295CB]
They were gods. Living, breathing gods.

Id: [0x002295CC]
Hmpf. Traitor.

Id: [0x002295CD]
Greetings, Kassandra. Welcome to Atlantis.

Id: [0x002295CE]
Atlantis! Impossible! I thought it was just a myth?

Id: [0x002295D0]
My name is Pythagoras. I'm your father.

Id: [0x002295D1]
And Ikaros is...

Id: [0x002295D2]
My oldest and dearest friend. I sent him to watch over you. And now, here you are.

Id: [0x002295ED]
Next time you want me to do two things, tell me both at the same time.

Id: [0x002295EE]
The second is dependent on the first. I needed to know it was complete... I didn't expect you to get so upset about it.

Id: [0x002295EF]
If you'd told me this needed to be done before, I could have taken care of it already.

Id: [0x002295F0]
Maybe, but this way I get to see you more often.

Id: [0x00229605]
[&breath]Maláka...

Id: [0x0022960D]
Thera... We found Atlantis!

Id: [0x00229616]
We've been searching for an Isu artifact with reality-bending powers, and <i>this</i> bothers you?

Id: [0x00229617]
Ms. Hassan, you were right. I'll help you pack up the gear.

Id: [0x00229618]
Atlantis? Let me check your vitals - you're delirious.

Id: [0x00229619]
Thanks. Let's roll out.

Id: [0x0022961B]
I don't see anything holding you back.

Id: [0x0022961D]
[&breath]You breathe life into me. If only you'd arrived on Delos before Thaletas.

Id: [0x00229629]
The job is done. Payment is my reward.

Id: [0x0022962A]
Coins are as cold as death, <i>misthios</i>. They soothe me as well.

Id: [0x0022962B]
We should probably move. They're going to come looking for us.

Id: [0x0022962F]
You and Thaletas? But the way you were at each other's throats in the cave...

Id: [0x00229631]
He's a stubborn, arrogant, glory-hungry Spartan!

Id: [0x00229633]
But behind all the bronze and brawn, there's a man I could see by my side when this is all over. [saddens]If we survive.

Id: [0x00229634]
The two of you fighting Athenians on the beach sounds romantic. I'd hate to interfere.

Id: [0x00229638]
I won't tell Thaletas if you don't.

Id: [0x00229639]
You're a bold one. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't tempting.

Id: [0x0022963A]
You're the one who threatened to kiss me.

Id: [0x0022963D]
Threatened?! I don't threaten, <i>misthios.</i> I act.

Id: [0x00229651]
There's so much of the story I haven't seen. I should go back to the Animus and visit Kassandra again.

Id: [0x00229654]
These are dangerous times. I'd hate to meet Hades without having tasted those lips.

Id: [0x00229657]
Very poetic for someone covered in blood. I like it.

Id: [0x0022965E]
Yes. I used to be called the Eagle Bearer, but Ikaros is long gone.

Id: [0x0022965F]
I've been searching for you. But you can't, it's...

Id: [0x00229660]
[&laughs]You weren't really looking for me, were you?

Id: [0x00229662]
It works. The Isu artifact. The Staff of Hermes Trismegistus.

Id: [0x0022966C]
Victory is close. I can feel it.

Id: [0x0022966D]
We haven't won yet. The fort will be treacherous, and the gods can be fickle.

Id: [0x0022966E]
It was the gods who sent you to me - I refuse to believe they'd send you here to die. So, what do you think of our islands?

Id: [0x00229670]
You must have so many questions, Layla.

Id: [0x00229671]
[interrupting]Listen to me. Order, chaos... If either triumphs alone, the world dies. I tried to bring an end to chaos, and it has only led to ruin.

Id: [0x0022967C]
I'll keep an eye out for reinforcements.

Id: [0x0022967D]
And don't you die on me!

Id: [0x0022967F]
You know my name.

Id: [0x00229694]
That should be the last of them, <i>misthios</i>. You're quite the warrior.

Id: [0x00229699]
[&laughs]The priests are so terrified of desecrating the sacred grounds of Apollo, women about to give birth are shipped over to Mykonos.

Id: [0x0022969A]
What happens if they don't make it to shore?

Id: [0x0022969C]
Boat babies.

Id: [0x0022969D]
A spy has been trailing us, reporting on our activities. I've got good reason to believe this worm has cost me a few soldiers already.

Id: [0x002296A1]
I think I prefer Mykonos. They really don't like you shedding blood on Delos.

Id: [0x002296A7]
What is this?

Id: [0x002296A8]
Justice,<i> misthios!</i>

Id: [0x002296AA]
That doesn't sound like "justice" to me.

Id: [0x002296AB]
Why do you care? These are the families of the guards who beat us and harass us! This is what they deserve.[spit]

Id: [0x002296AC]
These increased taxes are ridiculous - they choke the very life out of us. We must stand! We must <i>fight</i>!

Id: [0x002296B8]
There's no need for violence, we can talk this over -

Id: [0x002296B9]
Talk?! They've smashed our wares, they've <i>beaten</i> us!

Id: [0x002296BA]
<i>They</i> have, yes, and maybe <i>they </i>should to pay -  but this family has done nothing. This <i>child </i>has done nothing. They're innocent.

Id: [0x002296BB]
But - a lesson must be learned! We must teach them not to mess with us!

Id: [0x002296BC]
This is not the way.

Id: [0x002296C0]
It's over. [beat]Blood spilled, battles won. They made me general, you know. Just told me. You deserve the rank more than anyone here.

Id: [0x002296C4]
Stop it, now.

Id: [0x002296C5]
Or what?

Id: [0x002296C6]
Or I'll <i>make</i> you.

Id: [0x002296C8]
They paid you off, didn't they?! You-you work for <i>them!</i>

Id: [0x002296C9]
Have it your way, <i>misthios</i>. The woman and her child will not be harmed - but we're not done with you. We have our own scary mercenaries!

Id: [0x002296CC]
General? Looks good on you, Thaletas. You deserve it.

Id: [0x002296D1]
I deserve that and more for what I've done on these islands.

Id: [0x002296DA]
That should teach him!

Id: [0x002296DC]
For your efforts. I expect to have you help us in the future, as well.

Id: [0x002296DD]
I wouldn't count on that.

Id: [0x002296E6]
Kyra... can't make it for now.

Id: [0x002296E7]
Celebrate without her? Impossible!

Id: [0x002296F3]
Kyra don't like waiting. Go to the Altar of Artemis.

Id: [0x002296FD]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! This is all I have left...

Id: [0x00229700]
What have you done?! This was my livelihood.

Id: [0x00229704]
To victory.

Id: [0x00229707]
Please stop them, <i>misthios</i>! If they destroy all of this, my family will starve.

Id: [0x0022970B]
Too true! I only wish my Kyra were here to celebrate. I'm going to ask her to sail with me back to Sparta tonight.

Id: [0x0022970E]
Sounds like a challenge.

Id: [0x0022970F]
Too true!

Id: [0x00229711]
Thaletas, listen to me. Kyra... she took her life.

Id: [0x00229713]
She... what?! No! It's not possible. [beat]She deserved a better life than this. I wish her father were still alive, so I could kill him myself.

Id: [0x0022971D]
Go, celebrate! Tonight, the world is ours.

Id: [0x00229721]
After all we've done, I can't believe Kyra is gone.

Id: [0x0022972C]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Those bastards deserved to die.

Id: [0x0022972F]
Stop this madness! They're going to hurt my children too, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00229733]
I wanted to be. You know that.

Id: [0x00229737]
Thanks for being with me back there. I needed you.

Id: [0x00229738]
Oh! Did you hear? They're promoting Thaletas to general, and sending him back to Sparta in the morning.

Id: [0x00229745]
Thaletas is... dead. He attacked me on the beach. Because of [beat]us.

Id: [0x00229746]
He what? No! Why would he... Thaletas! You fool.

Id: [0x00229747]
That is what he deserves... May he sail safely to his distant shore.

Id: [0x00229749]
He left me no choice.

Id: [0x00229751]
You're scaring the children! Stop!

Id: [0x00229752]
And did your dog of a husband stop when we begged him to stop destroying our goods?

Id: [0x00229753]
Take it up with him, then. Or the military! Please, leave us alone.

Id: [0x00229762]
Break every one of these! If the merchant gets in the way, break him, too.

Id: [0x00229763]
Stop! Please! I need to sell these, my family's livelihood depends on it.

Id: [0x0022976A]
I lost my father. I almost lost my family, after what you did.

Id: [0x0022976E]
You have no right to hold us here. Release our goods at once!

Id: [0x0022976F]
We have every right if you don't pay your taxes like you're supposed to.

Id: [0x00229770]
You must be mad if you think we're going to cough up even more drachmae for the military.

Id: [0x00229771]
You test my patience, old man. Move away, these goods are due for confiscation.

Id: [0x00229774]
Among other things.

Id: [0x00229775]
Let the Fates come when they may. Tonight, Kassandra, we are together. All of us. One family. One rebellion.

Id: [0x00229776]
They are. But soon, I'll set sail.

Id: [0x00229777]
I'm glad you accepted.

Id: [0x0022977C]
Drink! It may be our last night together. We should celebrate.

Id: [0x0022977F]
Artemis smiles on you.

Id: [0x00229780]
[&laughs]Don't make her jealous!

Id: [0x00229784]
Your form is perfect.

Id: [0x00229785]
That too.

Id: [0x00229790]
Don't stir up that nest. Would spoil the mood.

Id: [0x00229795]
There you are. You look happy.

Id: [0x0022979A]
You can't do this! What malákas city is this, where the guards prey on their own people?!

Id: [0x0022979B]
It's simple - you avoid your taxes, we take your stuff.

Id: [0x0022979C]
Now, step away.

Id: [0x0022979E]
Or what?

Id: [0x0022979F]
<i>Misthios!</i> Please, talk some sense into these idiots.

Id: [0x002297A0]
If we aren't allowed to continue doing our business, the economy of Kydonia will fall to ruin.

Id: [0x002297A1]
This does not concern you, <i>misthios.</i> This is the law of the land! If they give up the goods, all will end well.

Id: [0x002297A3]
I said goodbye to the past, with your help. Now we welcome what the Fates will bring.

Id: [0x002297B6]
Laws are for the weak. People should live freely.

Id: [0x002297B8]
These merchants won't pay you a single drachma.

Id: [0x002297B9]
You will regret this. Kill the <i>misthios!</i>

Id: [0x002297C6]
Mykonos is definitely my favorite island.

Id: [0x002297C7]
And you're my favorite <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002297CB]
Thaletas should know about this.

Id: [0x002297CC]
He will. In time. For now he needs to focus on the rebellion.

Id: [0x002297CD]
So do we.

Id: [0x002297CF]
Thaletas can't know about this.

Id: [0x002297D0]
I agree. In time, he will. For now he needs to focus on the rebellion.

Id: [0x002297D4]
But first...

Id: [0x002297D8]
Um... Thaletas, maybe now's not the best time...

Id: [0x002297D9]
Relax. Thaletas tells me everything. And now, thanks to you, he knows everything about me. I'm glad you two had your fun.

Id: [0x002297DA]
Kassandra, about what I said at the beach...

Id: [0x002297DB]
Kyra and I have decided I'm going to stay here, with her, and help rebuild what was lost in the rebellion.

Id: [0x002297DC]
You were there when Kyra needed you. You're an ally to Sparta, and to our islands.

Id: [0x002297E4]
<i>Your</i> islands. So, the rebels are now the rulers?

Id: [0x002297E5]
One thing at a time. First, we celebrate. Besides, Sparta is calling Thaletas home. They intend to make him a general.

Id: [0x002297E8]
I wanted to be there for Kyra. She needed me. You needed me.

Id: [0x002297EA]
Right... Well, did you hear about Thaletas? Sparta is calling him home. They intend to make him a general.

Id: [0x002297F0]
Your taxes will go a long way in helping Kydonia. You should respect the law.

Id: [0x002297F1]
The military barely does a thing around here, and expects a bigger and bigger payout each year? Nonsense![&spit]

Id: [0x002297F3]
You see, <i>misthios</i>? Nothing will get through their thick skulls. But my fists will.

Id: [0x002297F4]
Now get out of my way before I take you out, too!

Id: [0x002297F6]
Thaletas, please, just forget it.

Id: [0x002297F8]
Well, I'm glad you two are together. And... happy. May Artemis and Apollo guide you as you govern your islands.

Id: [0x00229805]
Thanks for everything, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00229818]
You are safe now. Those guards won't bother you anymore.

Id: [0x00229819]
Maybe for today, <i>misthios</i>. But they'll be back at some point.

Id: [0x0022981E]
Those guards are dead because of you.

Id: [0x0022981F]
<i>You</i> killed them! Don't put the blame on me.

Id: [0x00229826]
Looks like Captain Diokles denied me my payment.

Id: [0x0022982C]
<i>Maláka...</i> What happened here?

Id: [0x00229833]
Ha, look who it is! You want to meddle in Kydonia's[2400880] affairs? It's going to cost you.

Id: [0x00229839]
You've messed with the wrong bunch.

Id: [0x0022983A]
Be careful, I've seen what the <i>misthios</i> can do. Keep your distance.

Id: [0x0022983F]
At least the captain had the decency to keep my gems on him. [beat]Never stand between a <i>misthios</i> and her payday.

Id: [0x0022984F]
<i>Please</i> hurry, my ears can't take any more of his complaining.

Id: [0x00229850]
Oh, sorry -

Id: [0x00229851]
Did you need something else?

Id: [0x00229852]
You'll have my eternal gratitude for shutting him up.

Id: [0x00229857]
Hmm. Important records. I should keep these.

Id: [0x00229863]
This looks like it might be useful...

Id: [0x0022986B]
I'm not running away! I'm just... fleeing strategically!

Id: [0x00229870]
Looks like you couldn't brave the Minotaur either! I won't tell if you won't!

Id: [0x00229A2E]
I don't know what you're talking about! I'm just transporting goods out of Kydonia.

Id: [0x00229A2F]
Any chance those goods include a recent army deserter?

Id: [0x00229A30]
We're no fools! Where have you hidden him?

Id: [0x00229A31]
Deserters? No - that's treason! I wouldn't do anything like that.

Id: [0x00229A32]
If you're going to keep lying, we'll just have to make you tell us. Break his legs.

Id: [0x00229A33]
Calm down now, no need for violence!

Id: [0x00229A38]
Who the fuck are you?

Id: [0x00229A39]
A <i>misthios</i>? You hired a <i>misthios</i> to help you smuggle deserters? Kill them both!

Id: [0x00229A3C]
Okay, fine. They <i>knew</i> I was doing it.

Id: [0x00229A40]
Mm-hmm.

Id: [0x00229A42]
Argh, <i>malákes</i> guards. They hit like bricks.

Id: [0x00229A4D]
<i>Or</i> was he paying you a lot.

Id: [0x00229A50]
I saw someone like that going in the other direction. Skinny man, like you described.

Id: [0x00229A51]
What?! He's supposed to be headed <i>here.</i>

Id: [0x00229A52]
The coward must've taken flight. I told him it'd be fine if he just followed my instructions.

Id: [0x00229A53]
I'm not so sure - I recall you being surrounded by guards.

Id: [0x00229A54]
I'd have been able to get out of it.

Id: [0x00229A60]
And my specialty is making people disappear -

Id: [0x00229A62]
In a... different way than you do.

Id: [0x00229A64]
No, I didn't see anyone on my way here.

Id: [0x00229A65]
He's supposed to be here by now.

Id: [0x00229A66]
He must've ran in the opposite direction worrying that the guards would search Kydonia.

Id: [0x00229A67]
That idiot! I told him to just listen to me.

Id: [0x00229AA4]
It's rare to find a man with a good heart these days.

Id: [0x00229AA6]
We've all got people we want to look out for.

Id: [0x00229AA8]
<i>Need</i> to look out for.

Id: [0x00229AA9]
Yes, we do.

Id: [0x00229AAA]
You just want her for yourself.

Id: [0x00229AAB]
That's not it!

Id: [0x00229AAC]
I mean, I have thought about it, but -

Id: [0x00229AAD]
Look, I just -

Id: [0x00229AAE]
I'm sure you do.

Id: [0x00229AAF]
We need to get to Isabel - I mean, the wife. If the guards came after me, she'll be in danger, too. Please go to her! I'll catch up when I can to take her to safety.

Id: [0x00229AB4]
Misthios, I beg of you, please go to Isabel in Kydonia, she could be in grave danger.

Id: [0x00229AB5]
This is none of my business. You're on your own.

Id: [0x00229AB6]
No! You can't just leave an innocent woman to die. Please!

Id: [0x00229AB7]
I'll make sure she's safe. Where will I find her?

Id: [0x00229AB8]
Follow the road to Kydonia! Her house will be on the left - look for the green cloth on the doorpost. Quickly! I'll catch up as soon as I can.

Id: [0x00229AB9]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00229ABE]
We weren't suppose to kill her, you idiots. Now we'll have to explain ourselves to the captain.

Id: [0x00229ABF]
She refused to spill the beans on her deserter of a husband. She got what she deserved.

Id: [0x00229AC4]
Who in the gods' names are you?!

Id: [0x00229AC8]
It looks like she put up a good fight... but not good enough.

Id: [0x00229ACE]
Isabel... I should've gotten here sooner. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00229AD0]
They got to her before me. There was nothing I could do but avenge her.

Id: [0x00229AD3]
I saw the guards dead outside. Good job, <i>misthios</i> -

Id: [0x00229AD6]
She trusted me, <i>misthios</i>! All I wanted was to make her smile. But every time I tried... All I brought her was pain.

Id: [0x00229AD7]
...It's all I ever do.

Id: [0x00229AD9]
I shouldn't have told her about my stupid plan to reunite her with her husband.

Id: [0x00229ADA]
I did this to her, didn't I?

Id: [0x00229AE1]
No, you didn't. Nobody wanted things to end like this - least of all you.

Id: [0x00229AE2]
Everything seemed okay when she smiled, you know? I didn't care who she was smiling at.

Id: [0x00229AE3]
You did your best.

Id: [0x00229AE4]
No one's "best" is ever enough.

Id: [0x00229AE5]
No. No it's not.

Id: [0x00229AEB]
Yes, this is your fault. If you hadn't made promises you couldn't keep, she would still be alive.

Id: [0x00229AEC]
But she was heartbroken, <i>misthios</i>! What would you have had me do? Just sit idly by, and watch her waste away?

Id: [0x00229AED]
I would have had you do nothing<i>. </i>She might've been sad, but at least she'd be <i>alive.</i>

Id: [0x00229AEF]
I just didn't - didn't want to see her sad.

Id: [0x00229AF0]
Now you can see her dead instead.

Id: [0x00229AF3]
Take this.

Id: [0x00229AF5]
I was going to give it to her when I helped them escape Kydonia. To get them through tough times.

Id: [0x00229AF6]
They won't need it anymore, and it's too heavy for me to bear. Take it as payment for your troubles. [beat]And leave me, please.

Id: [0x00229AFC]
Peace has been restored. [beat]That merchant better have my gems ready.

Id: [0x00229AFE]
Do what you must to bring order, but watch your back. There are people who seek to benefit from this civil unrest. We're counting on you, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00229B1E]
I just don't understand. It wasn't hard!

Id: [0x00229B31]
You don't understand. This confirms it, Kassandra didn't just have Isu technology, she had the means to improve it. Imagine how powerful the staff could be.

Id: [0x00229B44]
The spear you found is right here, and it's not doing anything.

Id: [0x00229B45]
The spear's attached to a bloodline. Leonidas, Kassandra, and Deimos... I mean, Alexios. They were intimately connected to it.

Id: [0x00229B5D]
Just tell me what you need.

Id: [0x00229B5E]
Unfortunately, getting Sophanes's name on the list doesn't make him a citizen. He also needs a witness who can validate his citizenship.

Id: [0x00229B5F]
So you want me to be the witness?

Id: [0x00229B60]
If only it were that easy. No, there's someone I have in mind. An extremely handsome man by the name of Peiroos.

Id: [0x00229B62]
I'll find your... handsome witness.

Id: [0x00229B63]
Perfect! I knew you'd be willing to help.

Id: [0x00229B65]
Sophanes can wait a bit longer.

Id: [0x00229B67]
There must be a good reason we can't be witnesses?

Id: [0x00229B68]
Of course. The witness must be an Athenian citizen, but it can't be a friend. Be careful with Peiroos, though. It's easy to... <i>lose</i> oneself in his gaze.

Id: [0x00229B69]
If there's more after this, I want to know now.

Id: [0x00229B6A]
Of course! This should be the last thing.

Id: [0x00229B6B]
Should?

Id: [0x00229B6C]
I mean <i>is.</i>

Id: [0x00229B80]
So Doctor, how do you feel now that we're closer than ever to the staff?

Id: [0x00229B8B]
You came for a fight. Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x00229B8C]
Very well. I know when to accept my fate.

Id: [0x00229B8D]
Fine. Give it your best shot.

Id: [0x00229BAE]
I'll pay more than whatever fool sent you.

Id: [0x00229BB0]
I can match your fee and more, misthios, if you just walk away now.

Id: [0x00229BB2]
No need to spill any blood today, <i>misthios</i>. I'm more than willing to pay you to turn a blind eye.

Id: [0x00229BD3]
Come now, <i>misthios</i>. Surely there's something I can do to change your mind?

Id: [0x00229BD5]
No one has to die here. There must be something I can do to convince you to walk away.

Id: [0x00229BE8]
I was thinking something more... short term. But if that's what it takes to avoid death, [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x00229BEA]
I never saw myself as a sailor, but [beat]life on the open sea is certainly preferable to death. I'm in.

Id: [0x00229C05]
Desert my post to sail with a mercenary hired to kill me? On second thought, let's get this over with now.

Id: [0x00229C07]
You're asking me to shirk my duty to do grunt work aboard your ship? Not a chance.

Id: [0x00229C1B]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00229C1F]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x00229C23]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x00229C27]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x00229C2B]
Thank you, misthios! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x00229C47]
You tell Dion I'm not giving him any more. If he wants to talk to me, he can come himself.

Id: [0x00229C48]
I'm not here about debts.

Id: [0x00229C49]
Well, what do you want, then?

Id: [0x00229C4B]
Time to find Peiroos.

Id: [0x00229C4C]
He's often around the justice building on the east side of the agora.

Id: [0x00229C4D]
And I just... ask him to help?

Id: [0x00229C4E]
Peiroos needs to say that the parents of Sophanes were both Athenian. How you get him to do it is up to you.

Id: [0x00229CB6]
There's something I need your help with. Well, you'd actually be helping someone else.

Id: [0x00229CB7]
That someone sent <i>you</i> tells me it's something I'd be better off avoiding.

Id: [0x00229CB8]
You just need to validate a man's citizenship. Alkibiades said it's an easy role for you to play.

Id: [0x00229CB9]
There's a man trying to become an Athenian citizen. <i>You're</i> going to be his witness.

Id: [0x00229CBA]
Me? Why?

Id: [0x00229CBB]
Because Alkibiades said you're the one to do it.

Id: [0x00229CBD]
I told you, Barnabas, Thera is said to hold a secret. A secret no one can fathom.

Id: [0x00229CC5]
He gave me his staff - and gave up his life for the good of the Greek world.

Id: [0x00229CC6]
[&breath]He was a stubborn man. He wanted to keep all the knowledge of Atlantis to himself.

Id: [0x00229CC7]
[&scoff]Huh,[/&scoff] stubborn. I suppose that trait runs in the family.

Id: [0x00229CC9]
The knowledge he must have had. The things he must have seen.

Id: [0x00229CCF]
Can you feel that? It's as if the gods walk among us.

Id: [0x00229CE3]
This is different. If what I saw in Egypt is true, this staff doesn't control minds... it controls physics. Time. Imagine rewriting the rules of the universe.

Id: [0x00229CE4]
Are you sure you can use the Staff of Hermes, then?

Id: [0x00229CE5]
No. But if the Templars get it, they won't stop until they find someone who can.

Id: [0x00229CE7]
I believe this staff is important. But the Templars and Assassins have found Staves of Eden before. Nikolai Tesla blew one up in Russia, if I remember correctly?

Id: [0x00229CE8]
You're back?! I thought my warnings of a horrific and <i>embarrassing</i> death at the hooves of the Minotaur had scared you off!

Id: [0x00229CF0]
So, does what I'm seeing as Kassandra match your research? I had to tweak the Animus to use what we have of the book as a reference.

Id: [0x00229CF1]
That "book" is a lost work by Herodotos. He basically invented the concept of recording history. And other figures are matching up, too. Kleon, Perikles... The chance to see the past firsthand is why I joined the Assassins.

Id: [0x00229D00]
We're all alive, and our injuries have healed. That's what matters.

Id: [0x00229D01]
Take things one step at a time. Observe, then act. Or kill everyone and search their pockets for answers. You decide.

Id: [0x00229D05]
Our regional commander was recently killed, and his promoted second in command is an incompetent fool. It would be best for everyone if he were to... disappear.

Id: [0x00229D06]
What you're talking about is treason.

Id: [0x00229D07]
What I'm talking about is what's necessary for Athens to succeed.

Id: [0x00229D0F]
I'll report in if Abstergo drops by.

Id: [0x00229D16]
The Pythia predicts the future in the Temple of Apollo. But it's <i>under</i> the temple where the true nature of things will be revealed.

Id: [0x00229D1A]
And who is this man I'm meant to help?

Id: [0x00229D1B]
His name is Sophanes.

Id: [0x00229D1C]
Sophanes? I know that name well. [beat]I won't help you, though, not for him.

Id: [0x00229D24]
I don't know him. Why don't you want to help?

Id: [0x00229D25]
A true <i>misthios </i>- never get all the information up front. Sophanes betrayed his men for drachmae. He deserves death, not citizenship.

Id: [0x00229D27]
I don't care what he's done. You're still going to help me.

Id: [0x00229D28]
I won't help someone who betrayed his men to the enemy for drachmae - and you shouldn't want to, either. Men like him don't deserve to live, let alone be citizens like the rest of us.

Id: [0x00229D30]
You're going to help, but it's your choice how bloody you are when you do. [beat]Or maybe I'll go to Dion and see if he'll pay me to get what you owe him.

Id: [0x00229D31]
You can't threaten me and expect to get what you want. You'll regret that.

Id: [0x00229D37]
Look, it isn't your fault - you didn't know. But now you do.

Id: [0x00229D3D]
Please leave. You're presence here puts us all in danger.

Id: [0x0022A1BF]
This must be Maia's necklace... <i>Maláka</i> kept it on him.

Id: [0x0022A26B]
The sick keep coming. Our prayers do little.

Id: [0x0022A273]
In the wrong hands, its secrets could bring about the downfall of humanity.

Id: [0x0022A275]
We cannot allow others to discover this place. We must find a way to seal it from the world forever.

Id: [0x0022A276]
I'll bring them back. [beat]But I still have questions for you.

Id: [0x0022A277]
And I have answers. For now, though, take this. It's part of a key to access an artifact that is hidden in Boeotia. I have an ally trying to find the second half as we speak.

Id: [0x0022A282]
Mydon's a good man. What they did to him is unforgivable.

Id: [0x0022A287]
Sounds like Dion may be sending someone to collect from you. Wouldn't it be nice to have the drachmae you need?

Id: [0x0022A298]
The bathhouse has been snake-free since you cleared them out. Our patients thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022A29C]
After you've seen dozens of these in the agora, they don't seem that valuable anymore.

Id: [0x0022A2A1]
Didn't I see this in Athens?

Id: [0x0022A2A6]
Beautiful.

Id: [0x0022A2AC]
Minotaur tours! Get your Minotaur tours here!  Learn how to defeat the mighty Minotaur! Slay the beast with this one weird trick all minotaurs hate!

Id: [0x0022A2B1]
Stay close! You don't want to miss a thing, warrior.

Id: [0x0022A2B6]
Hey, hero! The secrets of the Minotaur are <i>THIS</i> way!

Id: [0x0022A2BB]
Look out, that rock's actually a Minotaur dropping. He must have just been through here!

Id: [0x0022A2C1]
At night, if you listen closely you can hear the faint sounds of the Minotaur snoring.

Id: [0x0022A2C7]
It's a little known fact that Theseus was left-handed.

Id: [0x0022A2D5]
<i>And</i> that concludes our tour today, ladies and gentleman. Don't forget to tip your tour guide. [beat]That's me. Don't forget to tip me.

Id: [0x0022A2DD]
Warrior! Welcome to Pephka. Home of the Minotaur, and our world-famous Minotaur tunics!

Id: [0x0022A2DF]
Tunics! Minotaur tunics! [faster]One size fits all!

Id: [0x0022A2E0]
[beat]I don't see how one size can fit everyone.

Id: [0x0022A2EA]
You sell it well, kid. Let's go on your tour. [beat]You're not worried someone's going to steal your "world famous Minotaur tunics"?

Id: [0x0022A2EC]
I'm not here for distractions, I'm here for glory.

Id: [0x0022A2ED]
Many come here seeking glory, but few ever seem to leave with it.

Id: [0x0022A2F1]
Perhaps you'd like to take my Minotaur Tour? Learn all the Minotaur's weaknesses, fears, and secrets. Here's a freebie -

Id: [0x0022A2F7]
I'm pretty sure it was Sokrates who said: "The mind is the best weapon." Come with me, warrior! Keep your weapon sharp!

Id: [0x0022A2FD]
You're pretty easily distracted for a warrior...

Id: [0x0022A302]
Behold, an <i>exact </i>replica of the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0022A306]
Up the hill. Some of the workers lost control moving it into place. It killed two of them. Horns tore them clean apart. [beat]Well, not "clean" apart.

Id: [0x0022A312]
I've heard many tales of the Minotaur. They usually make Theseus sound more... heroic.

Id: [0x0022A313]
Well, Sparta's not known for its quality education, is it? Next thing, you'll tell me Medusa's real!

Id: [0x0022A317]
Whether Theseus was crushed by the Minotaur, or... by a large statue <i>shaped</i> like the Minotaur, he was nothing compared to me. I will succeed where he failed.

Id: [0x0022A318]
Oh, a confident warrior!

Id: [0x0022A31C]
[&breath]Let's just continue the tour.

Id: [0x0022A32E]
But! Drinking freshly squeezed Minotaur Hoof Elixir will no doubt give you the <i>oomph</i> you'll need to triumph!

Id: [0x0022A334]
I'll pass.

Id: [0x0022A336]
Of course, of course! You're under no obligation to help a poor kid from the streets of Pephka make an honest income in order to save his frail and sickly grandmother.[&cough]

Id: [0x0022A338]
You never know when you'll need some... Minotaur Hoof... Elixir...

Id: [0x0022A33A]
You've made a wise purchase, my fiscally responsible friend!

Id: [0x0022A341]
Where does this "Minotaur Hoof Elixir" come from?

Id: [0x0022A342]
The Hoof of the Minotaur, obviously! It's right there in the name.

Id: [0x0022A343]
...Uh huh.

Id: [0x0022A344]
What does this elixir do, besides... give me "oomph"?

Id: [0x0022A346]
Will it cure the regret of taking unnecessary tours?

Id: [0x0022A348]
...Yes!

Id: [0x0022A349]
And let me guess, you've got a vial, ready for purchase?

Id: [0x0022A34A]
It's just like <i>pater</i> always said, "Never leave home without the ground up hooves of a mythical creature."

Id: [0x0022A34F]
That's not enough drachmae.

Id: [0x0022A355]
And so concludes our tour!

Id: [0x0022A356]
...<i>That's</i> the tour?! I didn't learn anything about the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0022A358]
My customers are <i>always</i> satisfied!

Id: [0x0022A35B]
You can pay my associates on your way out. Please enjoy the rest of your stay here in Pephka!

Id: [0x0022A36E]
One last thing - I'm told a man named "Melite" lives in Pephka. Probably someone powerful. Likes wearing masks.

Id: [0x0022A370]
Never heard of him before. But Leiandros, the town crier, might have. He knows everyone. He's in the center of the city. Ask him.

Id: [0x0022A372]
Until next time, warrior!

Id: [0x0022A37D]
Good scam, kid. If I was as ambitious as you when I was your age, my life would've turned out much better.

Id: [0x0022A37F]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0022A381]
[beat]<i>That's </i>what you're offering?! <i>Who's </i>scamming <i>who</i> here?!

Id: [0x0022A38D]
"Leiandros"? Hmm. I'll look out for him.

Id: [0x0022A38F]
Leiandros? [&breath]I've already met Leiandros. That man knows an impressive amount of nothing.

Id: [0x0022A397]
Don't damage her gear! We can get a good price for it. She's basically walking drachmae!

Id: [0x0022A39B]
...Uh, well done, warrior! You've passed the... [making up a name]"Survive the Thugs" test! Not, uh, not everyone passes that! You've earned an extra 10% off our world famous Minotaur tunics!

Id: [0x0022A3A3]
Or, haha, you know what? <i>You've </i>given <i>me </i>a great tour! A tour of <i>friendship! </i>Which I will totally pay for! Here, a large drachma fee for your fantastic friendship tour!

Id: [0x0022A3A5]
A pleasure doing business with you.

Id: [0x0022A3AA]
One more thing: I'm looking for someone named "Melite". A man with influence and an obsession with masks.

Id: [0x0022A3AB]
Never heard the name. But there's a man in town, Leiandros, he knows <i>everyone. </i>I bet he can help you.

Id: [0x0022A3B0]
<i>Leiandros?</i> He's of no use to me.

Id: [0x0022A3B2]
"Leiandros." Sounds like someone worth knowing.

Id: [0x0022A3B6]
Can I interest you in purchasing some fermented Minotaur droppings or -

Id: [0x0022A3B7]
Are you really going to try that on me again?!

Id: [0x0022A3B9]
Can't hit the target if you don't shoot the arrow!

Id: [0x0022A3BF]
You fascinate me, <i>misthios</i>. I long for the day when we can sit, and drink, and tell tales.

Id: [0x0022A3C7]
I said stand back! I'll jump! I mean it! I -  clear a space! 'Cause I'm jumping! I don't want anyone to get hurt! From my jump! Which I'm about to do! Right NOW!

Id: [0x0022A3CF]
Back! Stay back! I'LL JUMP!

Id: [0x0022A3D0]
You don't have to do this. There's always something to live for.

Id: [0x0022A3D1]
No! Not for me! I-I've got nothing. I AM nothing...

Id: [0x0022A3D3]
This isn't even armor! It's my mother's third-favorite serving tray! [realizing]I'm a failure. [&breath]A failure!

Id: [0x0022A3DA]
Don't worry, I'm here to help.

Id: [0x0022A3DB]
Good. Good, good, good. Is there anything else I can tell you?

Id: [0x0022A3DE]
I don't have time to help you assemble a costume.

Id: [0x0022A3DF]
It's not about assembling me an admittedly majestic outfit - it's about saving my village!  If you change your mind, I'll be right here. [beat]Or splattered down there.

Id: [0x0022A3E1]
I've found this armor, which is certainly... shiny.

Id: [0x0022A3E2]
My gods... It's perfect!

Id: [0x0022A3ED]
I've heard enough - I'll find you an axe and armor worthy of a true Minotaur slayer. Just don't... jump.

Id: [0x0022A3F2]
Please, <i>misthios! </i>No one will believe my Minotaur-slaying lie if I don't <i>look</i> like a Minotaur slayer! Will you help me find what I need?

Id: [0x0022A3FB]
By Zeus's tunic, you're right. Of course you're right. I am a coward.

Id: [0x0022A3FC]
Come away from the edge. Talk to me.

Id: [0x0022A3FE]
You look like a warrior to me. Even warriors feel fear. There's no shame in it. Fear helps us survive. It's temporary.

Id: [0x0022A408]
The Minotaur's already dead. I killed it.

Id: [0x0022A409]
You - no, <i>I</i> was supposed to do it!

Id: [0x0022A40A]
Then my people are doomed...

Id: [0x0022A43E]
I sure hope that boat captain shows up so that I can get home. He took the last of my drachmae...

Id: [0x0022A441]
Asklepios be praised! May the sick find peace.

Id: [0x0022A44C]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0022A44E]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0022A450]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x0022A452]
I'd like to take you at your word, but... I'm sure you must have some evidence that they really are all dead.

Id: [0x0022A454]
Seems odd that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any proof he's free?

Id: [0x0022A45B]
I really think I would have heard from her by now if she were free. Do you have any proof that you finished the job?

Id: [0x0022A460]
What are you two doing here?

Id: [0x0022A461]
You know us - always on your tail. Old Herodotos couldn't wait to see you.

Id: [0x0022A463]
I'd like to take you at your word that the beast has gone free, but... do you have any proof that the job's been done?

Id: [0x0022A467]
I... fine. I'll do what you want.

Id: [0x0022A469]
You're right. If it's like you say, he doesn't deserve to call himself an Athenian.

Id: [0x0022A46A]
I'm glad we can agree. I'm just sorry you had to come all this way to find out.

Id: [0x0022A46E]
[&breath]Pythagoras was born around 570 BCE. That would make the man in that cave nearly 150 years old. What could possibly be keeping him alive?

Id: [0x0022A46F]
The Staff of Hermes Trismegistus.

Id: [0x0022A474]
Last I heard, he was still causing trouble. Do you have any proof that he's no longer a concern?

Id: [0x0022A476]
She still seems to be an active concern from what I've heard. Do you have any proof that she's been dealt with?

Id: [0x0022A486]
Until we know each other better... Do you have any proof it's been destroyed?

Id: [0x0022A48B]
It pleases me to be on Spartan soil again.

Id: [0x0022A48D]
It feels strange that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any evidence that he's no longer vulnerable?

Id: [0x0022A48F]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x0022A491]
I'd like to believe you but... something's off. Do you have any proof they've been destroyed?

Id: [0x0022A49E]
I know there's not much time, but I need answers.

Id: [0x0022A49F]
I imagine you have many questions.

Id: [0x0022A4C6]
I've reached the coordinates. The series of caves we detected should be right under me. My equipment's ready. Preparing to dive.

Id: [0x0022A4C7]
Layla, you have no idea what's down there. There could be sharks.

Id: [0x0022A4C8]
I prefer that to Templars.

Id: [0x0022A4C9]
We'll keep an eye out for Abstergo. Good luck, Layla.

Id: [0x0022A4CA]
Thanks. I'm heading down now. There has to be a way in. I'll find it.

Id: [0x0022A4E2]
I got something for you.

Id: [0x0022A4F0]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Id: [0x0022A50F]
What happened to Alopex?

Id: [0x0022A511]
You know, the guy who distracted you while I nabbed your purse!

Id: [0x0022A512]
That's the important thing... It's not your fault, I mean he probably sold it anyway. Yeah, bet he did.

Id: [0x0022A515]
Did you get my necklace?

Id: [0x0022A516]
I'm sorry, I didn't. But the Athenian is dead. You and your friends are free.

Id: [0x0022A523]
I had to kill him. He was a partner in this. He could have enslaved you all again.

Id: [0x0022A525]
It's real. [beat]I made it.

Id: [0x0022A52A]
Oh...

Id: [0x0022A52B]
I have move on now, but I'm glad I could help.

Id: [0x0022A52D]
What? I...

Id: [0x0022A52E]
It's all right. You don't have to thank me. Take care, Maia.

Id: [0x0022A52F]
I spared him. He's promised to help you and the others.

Id: [0x0022A530]
Good, I always liked him. He used to share his food with us and stand up for us when the Athenian got mad!

Id: [0x0022A532]
You'll do fine. Take care.

Id: [0x0022A539]
Everything in order, then... open sesame.

Id: [0x0022A53A]
So much power. The nodes are interconnected in ways I couldn't imagine. This is more complex than any Isu temple we've found. Lisbon, the Arctic...

Id: [0x0022A53B]
Not yet. But there's more to explore. I'll find it.

Id: [0x0022A547]
I should return to Maia.

Id: [0x0022A54D]
You've returned!

Id: [0x0022A54E]
Sokrates too, it seems.

Id: [0x0022A54F]
Much like you, he just can't seem to stay away.

Id: [0x0022A550]
I hope there were no issues?

Id: [0x0022A554]
Yes. He just needed a little push.

Id: [0x0022A555]
Ah. I was worried about that. Well, you did the right thing.

Id: [0x0022A558]
Peiroos didn't want to do it. When he told me why, I understood.

Id: [0x0022A559]
I see. Sophanes will be disappointed.

Id: [0x0022A567]
The Lair of the Sphinx. Impressive.

Id: [0x0022A56F]
You are.

Id: [0x0022A570]
I sensed it in the way you fought. Aggressive, but not reckless.

Id: [0x0022A573]
My name's Roxana.

Id: [0x0022A575]
I'm recording everything, Layla. You're going to be a hero for discovering this.

Id: [0x0022A576]
Do you see the staff anywhere?

Id: [0x0022A57F]
Do not bad citizens do harm to their neighbors, and good citizens, good? Is it possible to tell if someone will be good or bad without first giving them a chance?

Id: [0x0022A585]
A person isn't the same forever. Someone bad can become good.

Id: [0x0022A586]
But is the inverse not also true? Someone considered good can then become bad... How can we predict someone's actions now, let alone in the future?

Id: [0x0022A587]
Nobody changes - not enough, at least.

Id: [0x0022A588]
Then do a person's actions stay with them for life? If a man steals a sword from a blacksmith, is he bad until death takes him? How can we predict a person's future actions?

Id: [0x0022A591]
Maybe the gods told me. Maybe I had a vision of the future.

Id: [0x0022A592]
Maybe the device in your ear is noisy.

Id: [0x0022A593]
Sorry...

Id: [0x0022A594]
I came here with a purpose - to find you and put an end to what I started many centuries ago.

Id: [0x0022A595]
Then it's settled. Let's move forward.

Id: [0x0022A596]
Like always.

Id: [0x0022A597]
We've learned a lot, haven't we, you know-it-all?[&laughs]

Id: [0x0022A599]
I have your spear. Would you like it back?

Id: [0x0022A59A]
Oh? No, you can keep it - it's broken.

Id: [0x0022A59B]
But you used it broken. It was powerful.

Id: [0x0022A59C]
I used it to defeat enemies even Herodotos could not describe, but everything must come to an end. I left it to him when its power was exhausted - something to remember me by.

Id: [0x0022A5B2]
I... I have so much to tell you. That staff is incredibly important. [beat]It kept you alive. How?

Id: [0x0022A5B4]
Ask a student of Hippokrates - I hear he still has some. The staff served its purpose.

Id: [0x0022A5D8]
My friends and I are trying to keep it out of the hands of the Templar Order -

Id: [0x0022A5DB]
I used to assist order. Now I fight for choice, freedom. Chaos.

Id: [0x0022A5DC]
Pythagoras was right, you are the key to the prophecy. You will restore the balance, Layla.

Id: [0x0022A5E1]
It's good to have you back in Sparta, where you belong.

Id: [0x0022A5EC]
Sparta has missed you.

Id: [0x0022A5F3]
Thank you for giving us your voice.

Id: [0x0022A64D]
I heard what happened with the helots. You should know, I hear everything that happens in Sparta.

Id: [0x0022A669]
I know you do what's right in your heart, but you have to put your family first, lamb.

Id: [0x0022A671]
It's not over yet.

Id: [0x0022A672]
Should I slow down?

Id: [0x0022A676]
<i>Maláka</i>. There are Followers of Ares fanatics up ahead.

Id: [0x0022A684]
You ate the last piece?!

Id: [0x0022A685]
There's some leg left over there. Maybe an ear?

Id: [0x0022A686]
I killed the man, I should get first pick.

Id: [0x0022A687]
Shut up and eat! It'll go bad. The rest of him's starting to smell.

Id: [0x0022A68D]
Not sure why they'd need obsidian glass in the temple, but it's mine now.

Id: [0x0022A692]
What's wrong with him?

Id: [0x0022A693]
Where would you like me to begin?

Id: [0x0022A695]
He's spent all his life in front of the forge. He can barely hear a thing.

Id: [0x0022A696]
Watch.

Id: [0x0022A698]
You smell gross today, you old toad.

Id: [0x0022A699]
That's very sweet of you to say -

Id: [0x0022A69A]
You too smell like a rose.

Id: [0x0022A69D]
The trick is to just smile when you say anything. You should try it.

Id: [0x0022A6A5]
Now he'll finally shut up for a bit!

Id: [0x0022A6A7]
I heard that.

Id: [0x0022A6BA]
I've already been there. There wasn't much obsidian.

Id: [0x0022A6BB]
Oh. That's not good. But at least you got whatever <i>was</i> there.

Id: [0x0022A6C3]
That temple has been ransacked - the obsidian is gone.

Id: [0x0022A6C4]
I take it you saw to that personally.

Id: [0x0022A6CE]
Well, those are all the leads I had on any obsidian in the area.

Id: [0x0022A6CF]
Perhaps you could broaden your search beyond Kydonia, but I can't help you there.

Id: [0x0022A6D0]
I'll figure something out.

Id: [0x0022A6D4]
You're looking really good today.

Id: [0x0022A72A]
"Put the wood in the hay?"

Id: [0x0022A72B]
I'm a blacksmith, silly misthios. I deal with iron, not wood.

Id: [0x0022A72D]
You don't like taking showers, do you?

Id: [0x0022A72F]
No, I am not particularly fond of flowers.

Id: [0x0022A730]
They make me sneeze.

Id: [0x0022A731]
I like what you've done with the place.

Id: [0x0022A733]
What? What did you say about my face?

Id: [0x0022A735]
No, no! She said she likes the place.

Id: [0x0022A737]
Oh! I see. Thank you.

Id: [0x0022A738]
You're not very good at this.

Id: [0x0022A749]
These fangs aren't good enough for a bow.

Id: [0x0022A74E]
These fangs are too damaged for the bow.

Id: [0x0022A753]
The bowyer won't want these fangs - too damaged.

Id: [0x0022A758]
Now <i>these</i> are quality fangs!

Id: [0x0022A75D]
This is where the bowyer said the lynx would be.

Id: [0x0022A762]
Octopus Bay. The sharks should be close by.

Id: [0x0022A772]
<i>Somehow</i>...

Id: [0x0022A779]
The last Minotaur I killed talked less.

Id: [0x0022A77A]
<i>Killed?! </i>No, uh - we don't have to use the "K" word!

Id: [0x0022A77C]
I mean, grrr!

Id: [0x0022A784]
Oh, fuck it. [&breath]Hi.

Id: [0x0022A789]
There's no need for more blood. Just keep your horns away from me, and tell me what's going on here.

Id: [0x0022A78B]
You can take off that mask.

Id: [0x0022A78F]
There are a lot of canyons.

Id: [0x0022A791]
But I never have. I fear they keep her underground, where she'll never see the sun.

Id: [0x0022A793]
I don't scare.

Id: [0x0022A794]
Evidently.

Id: [0x0022A7C0]
Into the arms of Poseidon they go!

Id: [0x0022A817]
Stop wasting everybody's time and come back from the edge. If you were going to jump you'd have done it by now.

Id: [0x0022A818]
Wha-what? I will! Any second now!

Id: [0x0022A81D]
We can't. One thing I've learned is people are unpredictable. It's what makes my job so hard sometimes.

Id: [0x0022A81E]
If what you say is true, we can either hope we are right, and that people will be good, or limit risk by not giving people like Sophanes a chance.

Id: [0x0022A820]
A person's past shows who they'll become. The one easy part of my job is how predictable people can be.

Id: [0x0022A821]
Then a war criminal such as Sophanes must bear that choice, with no hope to change how he is seen.

Id: [0x0022A823]
I wonder then if bad actions can reverse good, or good actions can reverse bad. [beat]Perhaps we can speak on that another time.

Id: [0x0022A824]
Thank the gods.

Id: [0x0022A845]
Now that we've saved the children of Hydrea from a pack of hungry wolves, I guess we can move on?

Id: [0x0022A846]
You jest, but that was a real nuisance we dealt with. Your choices have an impact, Kassandra - your actions have already benefited the people here.

Id: [0x0022A848]
[beat]So, shall we complete our training?

Id: [0x0022A84D]
I'll get the wine.

Id: [0x0022A84E]
Wonderful. Now, if you want some <i>friendly </i>advice, Aristophanes cannot stand sweet wine. I've seen what it can do to him - absolutely, horrifyingly delightful.

Id: [0x0022A885]
I'll see if there isn't a thing or two I can learn from you.

Id: [0x0022A88F]
Show me what you can do with that bow and put them down. Maybe I can learn a thing or two.

Id: [0x0022A9FA]
Now, dear teacher, I think you should whisk me away for our <i>private </i>lesson.

Id: [0x0022A9FF]
No you won't. You're a coward.

Id: [0x0022AA00]
I'm no coward! I'll show you!

Id: [0x0022AA19]
Save for that arrogant playwright, I don't see many distinguished guests in here. Can I help you with something?

Id: [0x0022AA1A]
Yes, take it. But get out of my kitchen. I'm very busy, you know!

Id: [0x0022AA23]
You! You shouldn't be in here. What do you want?

Id: [0x0022AA25]
I've come to get your finest dry wine.

Id: [0x0022AA28]
I'm here for your sweet wine.

Id: [0x0022AA34]
I'm too busy to deal with you at the moment. Go on, now. Out of my kitchen.

Id: [0x0022AA36]
It speaks, and so feisty, too! Sometimes I wonder if I'm doomed to be the only young and beautiful thing here. So, what do they call you?

Id: [0x0022AA37]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022AA38]
I am called many things. "It" isn't one of them.

Id: [0x0022AA39]
What do you call yourself then, creature of many names?

Id: [0x0022AA3A]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022AA4C]
To Dionysos!

Id: [0x0022AA4F]
This... this is delicious.

Id: [0x0022AA50]
This is nectar of the gods! Another round!

Id: [0x0022AA51]
How about some more?

Id: [0x0022AA54]
Where did you find this delicious wine? It must be Perikles's finest!

Id: [0x0022AA55]
You know what they say! Good wine makes good friends.

Id: [0x0022AA56]
Ready for another?

Id: [0x0022AA59]
This is the best symposium I've been to in a while.

Id: [0x0022AA5A]
You know what? I like you. Who brought you here?

Id: [0x0022AA5B]
I brought myself. I'm on the trail of a woman who fled Sparta a long time ago.

Id: [0x0022AA5C]
Fled? Why?

Id: [0x0022AA5E]
She lost two children. She had no choice.

Id: [0x0022AA5F]
She fled to heal her broken heart. Euripides, write her into a play.

Id: [0x0022AA60]
I've heard Spartan mothers go to a sanctuary in Argolis to beg Asklepios for his divine pity. I should know - it's my home.

Id: [0x0022AA61]
After what she went through, I'm not sure she'd trust priests.

Id: [0x0022AA62]
Then she sought my friend Hippokrates. He's a physician, best of the best. He still keeps his office in Argos. If she went to him for help, there's no doubt he'd have given it.

Id: [0x0022AA66]
To us - who have persisted through everything. [beat]And to those who wanted to persist.

Id: [0x0022AA67]
And to the gods.

Id: [0x0022AA69]
To Athens. And our promise to return the city to its former glory.

Id: [0x0022AA6E]
To moving forward. We'll leave the past behind.

Id: [0x0022AA70]
I think I'm ready to go in.

Id: [0x0022AA71]
You can't! Not like that, anyway. The Athenians like it best when you try to <i>fit in</i>. But don't worry, I have just the outfit for you.

Id: [0x0022AA7A]
Don't say I didn't warn you.

Id: [0x0022AA7C]
There's no way I'm wearing that.

Id: [0x0022AA7D]
But if you don't -

Id: [0x0022AA7E]
I mean it, Phoibe.

Id: [0x0022AA7F]
You <i>have</i> to leave your weapons here, though.

Id: [0x0022AA80]
Fine.

Id: [0x0022AA90]
I only use these terms - war, gods, civility, etc., in context of what we can observe. I can see soldiers fighting, sure, but does that really bring me any closer to understanding war?

Id: [0x0022AA92]
A <i>misthios</i>? At this party? Well, at least you're someone new to talk to.

Id: [0x0022AAB1]
Kassandra?

Id: [0x0022AAB2]
I didn't send for you. No matter how you've dressed for my party, Phoibe shouldn't have let you in.

Id: [0x0022AAB4]
[&breath]My village, [sigh][&breath]we're poor. We get little trade, fewer visitors. We're dying. I was chosen to kill the Minotaur hoping it would make us famous, put us on the map. Save us, maybe.

Id: [0x0022AACF]
It is uncalled for, Sokrates. Perikles is doing all he can for Athens. Having his reputation attacked by Hermippos cannot stand!

Id: [0x0022AAD2]
Hermippos has gone too far, Sokrates. Perikles gave everything to Athens, yet we must still hear of Kleon's greatness?

Id: [0x0022AAD3]
Aristophanes, have you not done similar things to Hermippos?

Id: [0x0022AAD4]
How dare you compare me to that man! His plays are a nuisance - something I could come up with in an afternoon, and a drunken one at that. Mine are for a <i>clever</i> audience.

Id: [0x0022AAD5]
The same audience you judge, should it not be clever enough.

Id: [0x0022AAD6]
Careful Sokrates, else I make you a character in one of my plays.

Id: [0x0022AAD9]
A <i>misthios</i>? Here? I suppose they've sent you to mock me for my fight with Euripides?

Id: [0x0022AAE6]
What?

Id: [0x0022AAE7]
You eat like a wild animal.

Id: [0x0022AAEA]
Well, you <i>are </i>at a table.

Id: [0x0022AAFA]
A <i>misthios</i>, in Perikles's abode? I never thought I'd see the day! You must have seen me doing my impression of Hermippos. I call it "The Dejected Weasel." Tell me, what does it think?

Id: [0x0022AB0E]
I couldn’t help but notice your talent for debate. Well done.

Id: [0x0022AB0F]
Sokrates is an... interesting character.

Id: [0x0022AB13]
You shouldn’t be too hard on Sokrates. He really has a brilliant mind, even if he comes off a little strong.

Id: [0x0022AB14]
He isn't always like that, is he?

Id: [0x0022AB1A]
Do you agree with Sokrates that Hermippos should say what he wants?

Id: [0x0022AB37]
We do what we have to to survive, and there's no shame in that, believe me. [beat]You make an interesting choice, Kassandra, in not dressing to fit in.

Id: [0x0022AB38]
Fit in? Fancy clothes wouldn't help me fit in. Your Athenian chitons are strange to me.

Id: [0x0022AB41]
Sorry.

Id: [0x0022AB7E]
They're only words. Hermippos should be able to say what he wants.

Id: [0x0022AB80]
This may be the first time I've seen Sokrates listen more than he speaks.

Id: [0x0022AB81]
Remember it well - you may not see it ever again.

Id: [0x0022AB82]
Most people should keep their words to themselves, including Hermippos.

Id: [0x0022AB84]
If you have such an issue with Hermippos, why not do something about it yourself?

Id: [0x0022AB85]
I'd like to, but I haven't been able to find him. Maybe you'd have better luck?

Id: [0x0022AB8D]
At least all the excitement is over. Things can get back to normal now.

Id: [0x0022AB91]
Time for some fun. You'll have to help me get out of my clothes.

Id: [0x0022ABA3]
I love getting drunk and singing. Come back if you want to sing with me.

Id: [0x0022ABA4]
I'll think about it.

Id: [0x0022ABAC]
Alexi- <i>Deimos</i>, why don't we go hunting tomorrow.

Id: [0x0022ABAF]
I just thought...

Id: [0x0022ABB0]
It's a good idea.

Id: [0x0022ABB1]
And he's good at it. Obviously.

Id: [0x0022ABC9]
Go take your boys somewhere else.

Id: [0x0022ABCA]
What is it?

Id: [0x0022ABCF]
It can't be that hard to find Hermippos.

Id: [0x0022ABD2]
Sounds like fun.

Id: [0x0022ABF2]
You used to bolt around this place like a calf in the field. You wouldn't slow down.

Id: [0x0022ABF3]
I remember.

Id: [0x0022ABF5]
You chipped that, chasing your <i>pater</i> around the table.

Id: [0x0022ABF6]
I remember that, too.

Id: [0x0022ABF7]
So many memories.

Id: [0x0022ABF9]
With more to come.

Id: [0x0022AC03]
I couldn't find Hermippos, but I did find out something about him. He's a member of the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x0022AC04]
Then it's no wonder he attached himself so closely to Kleon. Discrediting Perikles and his beliefs in Athens would benefit Hermippos and the Cult, I'd imagine.

Id: [0x0022AC05]
That's what I thought as well. Maybe he's afraid I'll find him.

Id: [0x0022AC06]
I have other things I need to do first.

Id: [0x0022AC09]
You, you were meant to help!

Id: [0x0022AC0B]
I don't know why I bother.

Id: [0x0022AC16]
We should set a course for Megaris.

Id: [0x0022AC1D]
No matter what he says? What if he devoted his life to slandering you - not just in Athens, but throughout the land?

Id: [0x0022AC1E]
Saying what he wants doesn't mean he would escape my spear.

Id: [0x0022AC1F]
Then everything we say has a consequence, even if we are allowed to say it. An intriguing thought, wouldn't you agree?

Id: [0x0022AC20]
I prefer to think before I speak. And now, having thought, I shall. Tell me - just as I am allowed to say what I wish, should not all be allowed to do the same?

Id: [0x0022AC21]
Of course not! And there's much <i>you've</i> said that <i>I'd</i> say you shouldn't have, Sokrates!

Id: [0x0022AC22]
What if what I say offends one, but is loved by another? Should I say nothing in fear of what people may think?

Id: [0x0022AC23]
That would be nice, yes.

Id: [0x0022AC24]
What if you believe Hermippos should not be given the right to speak, but others do? Who then decides what speech is allowed? It is a dangerous path to tread.

Id: [0x0022AC25]
And one I clearly must. How you can stand up for Hermippos when he attacks Perikles is beyond me.

Id: [0x0022AC26]
I stand up for no one, only truth and freedom of speech.

Id: [0x0022AC2B]
Do you still believe he should say what he wants, Sokrates?

Id: [0x0022AC2C]
I know not what I think, nor what I know.

Id: [0x0022AC2E]
Yes, you deserve a play of your own...

Id: [0x0022AC34]
Excellent! How about a little bet on our boy then?

Id: [0x0022AC35]
You can never have enough drachmae. This will be an easy bounty.

Id: [0x0022AC37]
I'm not really the gambling type, but I'll give it a go.

Id: [0x0022AC39]
No. I've done my job, and now I want my drachmae.

Id: [0x0022AC3A]
Suit yourself - more drachmae for Aletes.

Id: [0x0022AC3C]
Good, you're back. Get it done?

Id: [0x0022AC3D]
Of course.

Id: [0x0022AC3E]
On occasion.

Id: [0x0022AC3F]
My <i>lucky</i> javelin. It broke. Can you fix it?

Id: [0x0022AC58]
Which is why tonight is a fine time to celebrate what may be our last taste of freedom.

Id: [0x0022AC5D]
This looks like it'll work.

Id: [0x0022AC5E]
Sounds simple enough.

Id: [0x0022AC5F]
If you are correct, I will surrender that which I guard. If you are wrong, <i>I</i> shall end <i>you</i>.

Id: [0x0022AC62]
<i>War, war, war!</i>

Id: [0x0022AC90]
Isn't this magnificent?

Id: [0x0022AC91]
It's certainly impressive. Though I'm sad we'll be missing the chariot races.

Id: [0x0022AC92]
Oh, what I would have given to see that!

Id: [0x0022AC94]
We should take in the sights and praise the gods to be here at such a time.

Id: [0x0022AC95]
Which sights should we see?

Id: [0x0022AC96]
There're so many! Let me think... The Temple of Zeus, the Altar of Zeus, and of course, the Olympic Tree.

Id: [0x0022BD4C]
You used to run part of the Japanese Brotherhood - what would you do?

Id: [0x0022BD63]
I've heard tales of you and your exploits, <i>misthios</i>. Impressive... if they're true.

Id: [0x0022BD65]
I've heard a lot. A warrior adventuring across the land. Sometimes they're half beast. Or half god. But always an Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0022BD84]
Ah, the soon-to-be Hero of the Arena returns!

Id: [0x0022BD8A]
Perhaps I can make the arena walls shake once again...

Id: [0x0022BD8B]
<i>Good.</i>

Id: [0x0022BD8E]
Not today.

Id: [0x0022BD8F]
When you're ready, I'll be waiting.

Id: [0x0022BD9A]
Tell me more about the arena.

Id: [0x0022BD9B]
True. Fighters today care only about drachmae. Not honor. And the crowds now come only to watch one warrior gut another. They're jaded. They want more than just killing. They want cruelty.

Id: [0x0022BDA1]
Who is this Maion? I met him at a cemetery down the coast.

Id: [0x0022BDA3]
Tell me about the other fighters.

Id: [0x0022BDA4]
As a new contender, the choice of opponent will be yours. No slaves here, no hapless criminals. Just warriors with the resolve to spill blood for the crowd.

Id: [0x0022BDA9]
My blades and I are ready.

Id: [0x0022BDAC]
I need some time.

Id: [0x0022BDAD]
Then the crowd waits.

Id: [0x0022BDB8]
The arena's called to you.

Id: [0x0022BDC3]
Do you hear? You must've done well in there.

Id: [0x0022BDC9]
Of course they cheer for me. Who could resist cheering for a warrior-legend in the arena?

Id: [0x0022BDCB]
It's not the cheering crowds that bring me to the arena. I'm a <i>misthios</i>, after all.

Id: [0x0022C0EC]
All these things with Zeus in the name - I get confused!

Id: [0x0022C0F0]
You have fun Barnabas - I'll catch up with you later.

Id: [0x0022C0F5]
We should make an offering to Zeus for good luck in the Games.

Id: [0x0022C0F6]
I'd like to see the Olympic Tree.

Id: [0x0022C0F7]
Even more than I imagined. There's so much to see and do!

Id: [0x0022C0F8]
We're in Olympia. It's only fitting we visit the Temple of Zeus.

Id: [0x0022C145]
Ugh, I think I've had enough of the stench of offal and burned meat.

Id: [0x0022C15A]
That's a nice horse, Sokrates.

Id: [0x0022C15B]
It's a very nice horse... a sturdy horse. It's also a stolen horse.

Id: [0x0022C15C]
Have you decided what should be done?

Id: [0x0022C15F]
It looks like I'll have to report you, Sokrates. It's what a good citizen would do, right?

Id: [0x0022C160]
Oh! Very good. Although a bit preemptive without all the details, wouldn't you say?

Id: [0x0022C161]
It was a joke...

Id: [0x0022C162]
The real question is whether there is truth behind the joke, or if one's mind can be changed once the whole story is revealed.

Id: [0x0022C163]
Sokrates the horse thief... I can almost hear the stories they'll tell. Aristophanes will love this.

Id: [0x0022C164]
Unfortunately, those stories would be entirely fabricated. [beat]Although, I <i>would</i> like to see if you believe the story should still be told once you know the truth.

Id: [0x0022C168]
Atlantis is too dangerous. I must seal it.

Id: [0x0022C175]
What story is that?

Id: [0x0022C176]
There is a man nearby who is responsible for stealing the horse. I've been contemplating the proper course of action, but I'd like to know what <i>you</i> think is right.

Id: [0x0022C179]
And how should I make my decision?

Id: [0x0022C17A]
Your thoughts are your own, but speaking to the thief himself may help you decide. <i>Can</i> such a crime be justified? It's an interesting thought.

Id: [0x0022C17B]
I'll leave this one to you.

Id: [0x0022C180]
I need more time to decide.

Id: [0x0022C181]
And this is nothing! On the final day the <i>mageiros</i> will slaughter a hundred bulls for the hecatomb to honor Zeus.

Id: [0x0022C183]
To think I would see such an offering to the gods in Olympia itself...

Id: [0x0022C184]
I've never seen anything like this.

Id: [0x0022C185]
Sounds like hooey to me. But he's insistent about it.

Id: [0x0022C186]
Herodotos is right. Atlantis exists.

Id: [0x0022C187]
Incredible!

Id: [0x0022C188]
I-it's true? [beat]I can't believe it. Tell me everything!

Id: [0x0022C189]
[&ah]Ignore him. When you're ready, I'm all ears. I need every last detail.

Id: [0x0022C18E]
Was there something else?

Id: [0x0022C191]
Are you the one who stole the horse? Sokrates said I should talk to you.

Id: [0x0022C192]
Bad enough being caught, but to have a <i>misthios </i>judge me...

Id: [0x0022C193]
Better me than an Athenian guard. Anything to say?

Id: [0x0022C196]
I'll tell you some day. It's too complicated for small talk.

Id: [0x0022C197]
My mother sent me here to meet my real father. [beat]You know... Pythagoras? It's him.

Id: [0x0022C198]
Pythagoras?! That's unthinkable - it would make him immortal.

Id: [0x0022C199]
He had a staff that belonged to the Ancient Civilization.

Id: [0x0022C19A]
Well, where is he? Invite him along - he's your father after all.

Id: [0x0022C19F]
That's enough! I'll do what you want.

Id: [0x0022C1A1]
But none of this can <i>ever</i> pass your lips. This stays between us.

Id: [0x0022C1A2]
You have my word.

Id: [0x0022C1A3]
But the world needs to know! We could tell the most <i>amazing</i> tale of our time.

Id: [0x0022C1A4]
Herodotos...

Id: [0x0022C1A5]
Oh, fine.

Id: [0x0022C1AF]
Like those who came before, you have failed.

Id: [0x0022C1B2]
The man I stole it from won't even miss it. He has plenty of others, while my only horse died last week. If I had the drachmae to buy a new one, I would have.

Id: [0x0022C1B8]
Any reason you picked this specific horse?

Id: [0x0022C1B9]
It was the easiest one to take. Other than that, not really. [beat]Though I did make sure it wasn't his best horse.

Id: [0x0022C1BA]
A courteous thief?

Id: [0x0022C1BB]
I didn't steal it for fun. I did it because I had no other choice.

Id: [0x0022C1BC]
Did you steal the horse to use it or sell it?

Id: [0x0022C1BD]
I have a family to feed, and this horse will help me on the farm. Plus I have no other way of traveling right now.

Id: [0x0022C1BE]
I have enough information to make a decision.

Id: [0x0022C1BF]
I hope you can understand. Wouldn't you do the same if it was your family?

Id: [0x0022C1C2]
There's no other option?

Id: [0x0022C1C3]
Not that I could think of. Trust me, I feel shame for what I did.

Id: [0x0022C1C7]
I could eat.

Id: [0x0022C1C8]
But that's not for people like us!

Id: [0x0022C1C9]
What's wrong with people like us?

Id: [0x0022C1CF]
Speak for yourself - I'm on the hunt for truth. Gods know not all <i>your</i> myths are accurate.

Id: [0x0022C1D0]
They come from the gods themselves, who are the most reliable sources we have.

Id: [0x0022C1D3]
And you would know, as the eagle-bearing demi-god you are.

Id: [0x0022C1D4]
I do know one thing for certain. This has been an odyssey I won't forget.

Id: [0x0022C1D8]
I won't anger the gods for your belly. Get lost.

Id: [0x0022C1DB]
My friend here would like to savor your offering. I have the drachmae.

Id: [0x0022C1DD]
Won't say no to some extra drachmae.

Id: [0x0022C1E0]
Mmm, delicious. Thank you, my friend.

Id: [0x0022C1E2]
Hey, give me some of that meat. The gods won't miss it.

Id: [0x0022C1E4]
Gladly. I know how much this all means to you.

Id: [0x0022C1E5]
Well then, I think we've spent enough time here.

Id: [0x0022C1EB]
You've both been a great help to me. It doesn't matter who's right or wrong.

Id: [0x0022C1ED]
For all we know, anything's possible.

Id: [0x0022C1F0]
Agreed. Let's go.

Id: [0x0022C1F1]
Enjoying the Olympics so far?

Id: [0x0022C1F2]
It doesn't matter why he stole the horse - it belongs to someone else.

Id: [0x0022C1F3]
You surprise me yet again. I truly believed you would choose the other side.

Id: [0x0022C1F4]
Because I'm a <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0022C1F5]
Of course! Yet, when it comes to someone else, you decided a crime deserves a consequence no matter the reason. A safe choice, although I can think of times when it may not be right.

Id: [0x0022C1F6]
If he needs the horse more than the man he stole it from, let him keep it. It will do him more good.

Id: [0x0022C1F7]
So determining whether a crime deserves a consequence or reward is dependent on the reasons behind it. An intriguing thought, although I can see how dangerous such thinking might be.

Id: [0x0022C1F8]
The real question is whether my decision matters at all, or if this was just another test to see what I would do.

Id: [0x0022C1F9]
There is a good chance it is both, but an equally good chance it is neither.

Id: [0x0022C1FA]
Now you're not making sense on purpose.

Id: [0x0022C1FB]
Let me ask you one more thing. If one man kills another in order to save many, can his actions be considered just? Or should the man be punished?

Id: [0x0022C1FE]
The outcome may be better, but he should still be punished for his crime.

Id: [0x0022C1FF]
That is true, yet if his peers were to decide - especially those he saved - they may argue that though the action was wrong, it was necessary and just.

Id: [0x0022C200]
I'm not sure the law cares about the reasons.

Id: [0x0022C201]
But if we are to decide whether the law should act on a man, or if his crime should be pardoned, the worthiness of the action should be taken into account, should it not?

Id: [0x0022C202]
If the action was for a good reason, then he is in the right.

Id: [0x0022C203]
So in times like these, people like us get to determine the law? Many would believe a murder still deserves consequence.

Id: [0x0022C204]
The people whose lives were saved would disagree.

Id: [0x0022C205]
Then perhaps making choices that affect the most people for good is the correct path, wouldn't you agree?

Id: [0x0022C206]
Are we done yet? I can't stay here all day.

Id: [0x0022C207]
Of course you can't. It is a luxury few can afford. Even those with the time for it often lack the mental capacity for such things.

Id: [0x0022C208]
OK.

Id: [0x0022C20A]
So you didn't feel a need to know <i>why</i> he stole it? Your decisiveness is something to both marvel at and question.

Id: [0x0022C20E]
My family needs that horse! If I have to die getting it for them, so be it!

Id: [0x0022C210]
Perhaps she, too, is immortal.[&laughs]

Id: [0x0022C211]
[&scoff]Sure I am.

Id: [0x0022C225]
[&ahem]"Eagle-bearing misthios."

Id: [0x0022C226]
The short version please.

Id: [0x0022C24A]
Yes, but a lost world?

Id: [0x0022C24B]
It's perfectly possible - Atlantis may exist.

Id: [0x0022C24C]
It's not me, is it? I've proven I'm very competent!

Id: [0x0022C25B]
I thought it was the wind.

Id: [0x0022C25C]
Don't mock the gods.

Id: [0x0022C261]
I heard it's one of the wonders of the world - and sculpted by your friend, Phidias!

Id: [0x0022C262]
I'd hardly say friend. Even acquaintance might be pushing it.

Id: [0x0022C263]
Can't you just feel the presence of Zeus and Hera when you stand here?

Id: [0x0022C268]
It kept him alive all this time... Makes perfect sense.

Id: [0x0022C26F]
There's more to being the best than pure strength.

Id: [0x0022C270]
That's an excuse for the weak.

Id: [0x0022C272]
I'll show you who's weak.

Id: [0x0022C275]
Well, at least the family is all together.

Id: [0x0022C277]
I'll get more wine...

Id: [0x0022C285]
At what cost?

Id: [0x0022C286]
I'm sorry. I don't want my feelings to cast a shadow on your day.

Id: [0x0022C287]
Don't think of yourself as tortured by the gods, but as molded for greatness by their hands.

Id: [0x0022C288]
I am <i>molded</i> by no one's hands. If the gods know me, they watch in silence.

Id: [0x0022C289]
[&breath]Come. Let's leave this place. Fortunately for you, I have enough faith for the both of us!

Id: [0x0022C28C]
My life's been tainted by prophecy and the word of the gods. [beat]I've yet to see their hand in anything in this life.

Id: [0x0022C28D]
You may not see it, but they have steered you to greatness. You will be a hero for the ages!

Id: [0x0022C291]
I'd rather have drachmae than a wreath.

Id: [0x0022C292]
A kotinos is no ordinary wreath. The olive branches are harvested by children and taken to the temple of Hera. There, the <i>Hellanodikai</i>, or judges, make the wreaths.

Id: [0x0022C293]
I guess they'll be lighter to carry back to Sparta than gold.

Id: [0x0022C294]
At least you see the practicality, if not the wonder, of the Olympic wreaths.

Id: [0x0022C298]
You brought me to see a tree?

Id: [0x0022C299]
Not just any tree. This is the sacred tree from which the winners' <i>kotinos</i> are made.

Id: [0x0022C29C]
Barnabas?

Id: [0x0022C29E]
No, it was made better by your company.

Id: [0x0022C2A0]
A flock of harpies couldn't dampen my spirits - we're at the Olympics! You're competing, and I believe you'll win.

Id: [0x0022C2A8]
Yes?

Id: [0x0022C2A9]
Thank you for this. I hope I wasn't too much of a distraction.

Id: [0x0022C2C0]
You want romance? I hear she pursued a pirate queen.

Id: [0x0022C2C1]
Xenia? Do tell.

Id: [0x0022C2C2]
My lips are sealed.

Id: [0x0022C2D3]
Thank you for inviting us over.

Id: [0x0022C2D4]
Stentor, can you pass the wine?

Id: [0x0022C2D6]
All out.

Id: [0x0022C2E9]
This is the cusp of a great discovery. Will the gods speak to us? What will I say to them? What will they say to me? Does it matter?

Id: [0x0022C2EA]
It's otherwise undamaged.

Id: [0x0022C2EC]
I am amazed.

Id: [0x0022C2F0]
Remember how Kassandra took the Monger to task - for all of Korinth to see! That would suit a drama.

Id: [0x0022C2F1]
Kassandra killed the Monger as an act of espionage. That's exciting - write a scene like that.

Id: [0x0022C32A]
I helped him all I could. He was my friend.

Id: [0x0022C32C]
[&breath]I could have helped him more. [&breath]He was on my side.

Id: [0x0022C32E]
Your survival avenges him. He will be honored as a hero.

Id: [0x0022C333]
A tribute as good as your singing.

Id: [0x0022C335]
Much better at toasting than singing, I say.

Id: [0x0022C338]
At least we're still here.

Id: [0x0022C33F]
It's strange being in this house again.

Id: [0x0022C340]
It feels smaller than I remember...

Id: [0x0022C342]
And emptier.

Id: [0x0022C347]
Could you pass the salt?

Id: [0x0022C357]
This is good.

Id: [0x0022C358]
Good.

Id: [0x0022C359]
It's bittersweet.

Id: [0x0022C3A2]
[&breath]We don't have time, Barnabas.

Id: [0x0022C3A3]
I meant Mykonos literally has a history involving giants.

Id: [0x0022C3A5]
Apollo was once friends with Hyperboreans from the snowy north. Until one day, they sent two maidens and five of their men to Delos with offerings for the son of Zeus. They were never seen again.

Id: [0x0022C3A6]
And Mykonos?

Id: [0x0022C3A7]
The island itself was built from the corpses of giants slain by the legendary Heracles.

Id: [0x0022C3BA]
Keep it moving.

Id: [0x0022C3C1]
Is your stomach turning as much as mine is?

Id: [0x0022C3C2]
You'll get used to it. We'll reach Seriphos before long.

Id: [0x0022C3C7]
I never thought I'd leave Athens for good.

Id: [0x0022C3C8]
I've left places I've called home.

Id: [0x0022C3CE]
If you're waiting for the result, you shouldn't have to wait much longer.

Id: [0x0022C3D1]
My fate will be decided soon.

Id: [0x0022C3D5]
If you can't write, someone will write the name on the ostraka for you.

Id: [0x0022C3D8]
If I'm to leave Athens, I'm not sure where I'll go.

Id: [0x0022C3DC]
Patience, patience. We will have the results shortly.

Id: [0x0022C3DF]
Here to see the outcome?

Id: [0x0022C3E2]
The votes should be counted soon, and this will all be over with.

Id: [0x0022C3E6]
I've seen an ostracism or twelve in my day, but this is one of the best.

Id: [0x0022C3E9]
You look slightly out of place here.

Id: [0x0022C3ED]
Impiety is no small crime. Anaxagoras deserves exile.

Id: [0x0022C3FF]
Help me! Please, someone.

Id: [0x0022C403]
By the gods, why did it have to be snakes?

Id: [0x0022C40A]
You'll feel the sting of my venom.

Id: [0x0022C40E]
I'll end you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022C412]
You can't stop me.

Id: [0x0022C416]
The corrupt will be snuffed out one way or another.

Id: [0x0022C420]
Come on, come on. It's got to be here!

Id: [0x0022C421]
The Commander will be furious if I don't find it.

Id: [0x0022C422]
By Hades, where'd that drunk put the manuscript?

Id: [0x0022C428]
Did you find Thespis? My play must have its star.

Id: [0x0022C430]
I's not feeling too good...

Id: [0x0022C438]
Over here! Help me, please.

Id: [0x0022C43F]
Save me! Please, get me out of here.

Id: [0x0022C446]
Thank you. My legs... You'll have to carry me.

Id: [0x0022C44D]
What's so important about this ship?

Id: [0x0022C44E]
It's not the ship, but its cargo. It must reach its destination.

Id: [0x0022C44F]
Then what's the cargo?

Id: [0x0022C450]
I'm not ungrateful for your help, but it's better you don't know.

Id: [0x0022C451]
Why's that?

Id: [0x0022C452]
Just believe me. What we do is for the security and future of Athens. This mission must succeed.

Id: [0x0022C453]
My payment relies on it. So trust me, it will.

Id: [0x0022C46F]
Nobody chooses to be a slave. But being one provides me food, shelter, safety, and security. Especially now, with Euboea all but run by The Dagger. [&ah]They cannot see past their greed, and if they go unchecked we may all end up as slaves.

Id: [0x0022C475]
[beat]Granted, I was just there to distract those warriors with my roars and threatening gestures so they could be ambushed and stabbed from behind...

Id: [0x0022C47A]
Please hurry - who knows what those Masked Men are doing to my Amara.

Id: [0x0022C4B0]
Gah, why is this suit chafing?! I used a whole bottle of olive oil...!

Id: [0x0022C4B3]
Hard... to breathe... in a costume... this magnificent...

Id: [0x0022C4B6]
By Zeus, this fur doesn't breathe <i>at all!</i>

Id: [0x0022C4B9]
<i>You </i>are the Minotaur. You <i>are </i>the Minotaur. You are the <i>Minotaur! </i>[beat]You are <i>the </i>Minotaur. [beat]No, no, the last one was better.

Id: [0x0022C4BB]
These Masked Men, they're organized and unafraid. Their greatest weapon is no blade; <i>it's our greed.</i>

Id: [0x0022C4BC]
I'm coming, Amara! Do not be afraid!

Id: [0x0022C4F3]
Hmm. The husband's horses are missing.

Id: [0x0022C51D]
I'm here for Podarkes's head. The rebels will lead me right to him.

Id: [0x0022C51E]
These are such beautiful islands, Kassandra. At least visit the Sanctuary of Apollo <i>before</i> you start taking heads.

Id: [0x0022C560]
I'm exhausted, Barnabas.

Id: [0x0022C56F]
His house[2106052] is on the coast, north of Mykonos City. But he's heavily guarded. We've never been able to get close enough without taking heavy casualties. This is why I sent for you.

Id: [0x0022C573]
We're sorry you lost him.

Id: [0x0022C575]
He means he's sorry for your loss.

Id: [0x0022C577]
It's all right.

Id: [0x0022C57D]
Why?

Id: [0x0022C5B4]
Those Spartans look like they could use some help.

Id: [0x0022C5CE]
So now they have people watch us get punished? That's a different kind of shame.

Id: [0x0022C5CF]
I'm not here to watch - I just saw you by chance.

Id: [0x0022C5D0]
What you saw was a man who paid his master for freedom, but is being kept a slave.

Id: [0x0022C5D1]
You can do that?

Id: [0x0022C5D2]
My master gave me a price for my freedom, and I saved until I had enough. Now that I've given him the drachmae, he pretends as if the deal never existed.

Id: [0x0022C5D7]
Did you need something?

Id: [0x0022C5DD]
That isn't right. Let me talk to him for you.

Id: [0x0022C5DE]
Really? You'd do that? My name is Phaidon. I don't know who you are, but surely you were sent by the gods - they must have heard my prayers.

Id: [0x0022C5E5]
They did, and you deserve their help.

Id: [0x0022C5E6]
I can sense something in you - you're special.

Id: [0x0022C5E7]
I like to think so.

Id: [0x0022C5E9]
If you're waiting on help from the gods, I can leave.

Id: [0x0022C5EA]
No, please don't. Someone or something brought you here to me.

Id: [0x0022C5EB]
Yes. My legs did.

Id: [0x0022C5ED]
Gods or not, I'm grateful. My master should be near the silver mine[2408335] - he's likely overseeing other slaves like myself.

Id: [0x0022C5F6]
How long till Podarkes finds this cave? We're right under his nose!

Id: [0x0022C5FB]
Have you always been a slave?

Id: [0x0022C5FC]
Since my youth. I was in the wrong place and born to the wrong family. I've been sold more than once.

Id: [0x0022C5FD]
And you just now got enough to buy your freedom?

Id: [0x0022C5FE]
More like I found a master who was willing to give me that sort of deal. I should have known he'd lie. It was my only hope, and now it's gone.

Id: [0x0022C5FF]
Do you often get whipped like that?

Id: [0x0022C600]
More than you know.

Id: [0x0022C601]
What did you do?

Id: [0x0022C602]
I don't always know. Not working fast enough, looking at someone wrong, asking for water... Sometimes they do it just for fun. I'm not sure how much more I can take.

Id: [0x0022C60C]
I'll talk to your master and make sure he listens.

Id: [0x0022C60D]
He's not really the listening type.

Id: [0x0022C60E]
He will be with me.

Id: [0x0022C628]
They'll join you when you're ready to, you know, die horrifically.

Id: [0x0022C629]
Where's the thief now?

Id: [0x0022C62A]
I told him to wait by the stables southwest of here.

Id: [0x0022C62B]
If you caught him stealing a horse, what's to say he won't just run away?

Id: [0x0022C62C]
The hope of keeping the horse. [beat]That's where you come in. I'll let him tell you the rest.

Id: [0x0022C65D]
Wherever Hermippos is, I'll find him.

Id: [0x0022C65E]
Once Hermippos is in front of you, what are you going to say?

Id: [0x0022C65F]
I'm not entirely sure yet, but I promise you it will be a grand spectacle.

Id: [0x0022C664]
You look strong. I could always use more people to keep the slaves in line, if you're looking for work.

Id: [0x0022C665]
I'm already working. [beat]I'm here about one of your slaves, Phaidon.

Id: [0x0022C66A]
A mask from the Cult of Kosmos... Hermippos must be a member.

Id: [0x0022C66D]
It almost sounds like you're jealous of Hermippos.

Id: [0x0022C66E]
Ha! Me, envious of <i>him</i>? Making someone sad is easy, but making someone laugh takes true skill and talent.

Id: [0x0022C670]
As if I know their names. You're wasting my time.

Id: [0x0022C673]
What is it?

Id: [0x0022C679]
Give me a moment to explain.

Id: [0x0022C67A]
That's close enough to begging for me. Fine, speak.

Id: [0x0022C684]
There's a man who paid you for his freedom. He'd like you to follow through on that promise.

Id: [0x0022C686]
I shouldn't even need to be here. You're the one wasting <i>my </i>time.

Id: [0x0022C687]
Ha, nobody has spoken to me like that in quite a while. Spit it out while you're still entertaining.

Id: [0x0022C688]
Phaidon paid you for his freedom. Give it to him.

Id: [0x0022C68A]
Hmm, doesn't sound familiar. But I'm feeling generous. Do something for me, and I'll give this Phaidon his freedom.

Id: [0x0022C68B]
What is it?

Id: [0x0022C68C]
There's a woman I'd like you to kill. It'll leave her family to fend for themselves... but the Cult of Kosmos needs it done.

Id: [0x0022C691]
He holds his nose so high in the air, he couldn't find the Statue of Artemis Agrotera if he was standing on her head!

Id: [0x0022C6B7]
What do you want with her?

Id: [0x0022C6C1]
Why does this woman need to die?

Id: [0x0022C6C2]
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you needed to know that. Wait... you don't.

Id: [0x0022C6C3]
Phaidon said you already broke your promise once. This better not be another of those times.

Id: [0x0022C6C4]
Look around. I have plenty of slaves. In exchange for the woman's death, I can let one go.

Id: [0x0022C6C7]
I'll be on my way.

Id: [0x0022C6C8]
Kill the woman or not - it's your choice. But if you want your slave friend to go free, it's the only way.

Id: [0x0022C6DD]
I killed the woman.

Id: [0x0022C6DE]
Wonderful! I don't know why this slave is so special to you... Perhaps you wish to keep him as your own?

Id: [0x0022C6DF]
He's free, then?

Id: [0x0022C6E0]
Yes, yes, he's free. You purchased him with the life of another. A fair trade.

Id: [0x0022C6E1]
Now leave before I change my mind.

Id: [0x0022C6E5]
Have you decided to give up on your slave friend? If you have, I won't give you another chance.

Id: [0x0022C6E7]
I haven't made a decision yet.

Id: [0x0022C6E8]
Well do so - quickly.

Id: [0x0022C6EE]
I'm not going to kill someone so you'll free Phaidon when he should have been already.

Id: [0x0022C6EF]
Fine. I'll find someone else to kill her and Phaidon will remain my slave. I'll be sure he receives a grand reward for wasting so much of my time.

Id: [0x0022C6F6]
What do you want with her?

Id: [0x0022C6F9]
I got a note from Kyra. Her rebellion is failing.

Id: [0x0022C6FB]
She's clever - Sparta got the same note. <i>I</i> will help Kyra reclaim these islands.

Id: [0x0022C6FC]
Just don't forget who helped you reclaim this beach.

Id: [0x0022C700]
Kyra sent me a note. I'm here to kill Podarkes.

Id: [0x0022C706]
The armor must belong to the ancient warrior. But why remove it and spread it out across the lands?

Id: [0x0022C707]
Good question. It must have something to do with the text.

Id: [0x0022C718]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0022C719]
You killed the last member of the Cult. Well, just about.

Id: [0x0022C71B]
It's true. I was their leader, but only for a moment it seemed. When your brother came along, it changed everything we were aiming for.

Id: [0x0022C729]
You agreed with them? With the fucking Cult?

Id: [0x0022C72A]
The powers that be in the Greek world weren't doing things the right way. The Cult just wanted a clean slate.

Id: [0x0022C72E]
Kassandra! What chance that we should meet here.

Id: [0x0022C72F]
It doesn't really feel like chance...

Id: [0x0022C730]
Ah, so you wish for today's topic to be about fate?

Id: [0x0022C731]
No, not really.

Id: [0x0022C732]
Good, because I had another in mind.

Id: [0x0022C738]
Do I have to leave Attika to be rid of you? It feels like you're everywhere I go.

Id: [0x0022C739]
It <i>is</i> very strange. But to answer your question, yes, leaving Attika would help.

Id: [0x0022C73B]
Attika is large, yet <i>fate</i> keeps bringing us together.

Id: [0x0022C73C]
Ah, you're trying to bring us back to fate once again. I won't let you avoid answering my questions, though.

Id: [0x0022C73E]
So how much did you overhear?

Id: [0x0022C73F]
Oh, all of it. You have a difficult choice to make, clearly. How much is the freedom of one person worth? Do you believe one life is worth more than another?

Id: [0x0022C745]
People aren't equal, even if we wish it were true.

Id: [0x0022C746]
So you would say, for example, that your life is worth more than another's? Then would you also say that there are some who are more worthy of life than yourself?

Id: [0x0022C74A]
There's no difference between one person and another. We all take our first breath the same way.

Id: [0x0022C74B]
But are the breaths <i>you</i> take equal to my own? Would you not say the breath of Perikles is put to better use than that of someone in prison?

Id: [0x0022C750]
I thought Deimos was on your side.

Id: [0x0022C758]
<i>Maláka</i>... So you were after us.

Id: [0x0022C759]
I wanted to protect him, so I kept him in the dark. He would have had his own opinions. But he was never supposed to die. <i>That </i>is the truth.

Id: [0x0022C75C]
It doesn't matter which two people you compare, the answer is the same.

Id: [0x0022C75D]
So a thief is equal to a priest... A politician to a child. An interesting view.

Id: [0x0022C75E]
Of course Perikles can do more than someone like a thief.

Id: [0x0022C75F]
Then perhaps people aren't equal after all. Your changed mind makes it clear how difficult a question this is.

Id: [0x0022C760]
Of course I wouldn't say someone else is more worthy of life than I am.

Id: [0x0022C761]
But to say that contradicts your point. Unless, of course, you believe yourself to be the most worthy of life out of all who currently live?

Id: [0x0022C763]
I'm not that naive. There are many who likely deserve life more than me.

Id: [0x0022C764]
So you would admit that a life's worthiness is dependent on a person's actions and what they have done or can do for the world?

Id: [0x0022C76A]
Ah, you're right. I know you are busy, and your mind is weary.

Id: [0x0022C76B]
That does sound like me.

Id: [0x0022C76C]
Go now. It has been an honor having these conversations with you.

Id: [0x0022C771]
It will take some time to go through my notes. Search for the missing stele fragment and then return.

Id: [0x0022C790]
Looks like Kleon made notes for Hermippos on his play... Everyone's a writer.

Id: [0x0022C794]
This is a lot of money for someone like Hermippos. Explains his residence, at least.

Id: [0x0022C79A]
He trusted you. And in the end, you <i>didn't</i> protect him. Maybe he would be alive if you'd stopped them.

Id: [0x0022C79B]
Gods know I would have if I could. When Deimos killed him, I knew the original cause was lost. I had to retreat.

Id: [0x0022C7A4]
Looks like your situation's improved since we last met.

Id: [0x0022C7B3]
You have dishonored yourself and the Games.

Id: [0x0022C7B4]
So. What happens now?

Id: [0x0022C7B5]
We shift focus. We steer towards a new republic under one supreme rule. A dream I'll make reality.

Id: [0x0022C7B6]
But it <i>is </i>still a dream. One that isn't realistic.

Id: [0x0022C7B7]
Abandon what you know and just imagine! Forget democracy. No more blue and red, just citizens working for a greater good.

Id: [0x0022C7BE]
Please, let me explain.

Id: [0x0022C7BF]
What crime has this woman committed?

Id: [0x0022C7C0]
Exactly that - her crime is that she <i>is</i> a woman.

Id: [0x0022C7C1]
It's news to me that's now a crime. Shouldn't you lock yourself up first, then?

Id: [0x0022C7C2]
I am the Priestess of Demeter - I preside over the Games. She's a married woman who tried to watch them. Disguised as a man, no less!

Id: [0x0022C7C3]
And why is any of this a crime?

Id: [0x0022C7C4]
For a married woman, there's too much... temptation.

Id: [0x0022C7C5]
No excuses. You know the price for your transgression.

Id: [0x0022C7C6]
Kallipateira. I just wanted to see my son compete. My family has a proud lineage at the Olympic Games - my father, brothers, nephew, and son have all won wreaths. Do I not have the right to see them?

Id: [0x0022C7C7]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0022C7C9]
Enough of your lies!

Id: [0x0022C7CA]
Then I'll be back.

Id: [0x0022C7CD]
It's not my place to interfere.

Id: [0x0022C7CE]
Your laws are wrong, and I'll prove it.

Id: [0x0022C7D0]
Help me - prove I have a right to see my son compete.

Id: [0x0022C7D1]
You have no right. You broke a sacred tradition, and for that you will be punished.

Id: [0x0022C7FD]
I need more time. I'm sure I can convince you.

Id: [0x0022C806]
This is nothing! Death is the punishment. She shall be thrown from the mountain.

Id: [0x0022C809]
She doesn't deserve to be punished like this.

Id: [0x0022C80A]
As you're so outspoken in her defense, I will give you a chance. Present me evidence of Kallipateira's noble heritage - or she will die as she ruled, to appease the gods.

Id: [0x0022C812]
I should hope so - it's me!

Id: [0x0022C813]
I'm looking for Kallipateira's son. Do you know him?

Id: [0x0022C81A]
That's good to know, but I need more. The Priestess of Demeter has accused your mother of sacrilege.

Id: [0x0022C81B]
Is she all right? What happened?

Id: [0x0022C81C]
Your mother has been accused of impiety.

Id: [0x0022C81D]
What! What's going on? What happened?

Id: [0x0022C81E]
Please, calm down.

Id: [0x0022C81F]
Calm down! Do you know what they'll do to her?

Id: [0x0022C820]
She's fine for now. She snuck into the stadium to watch you, and I need to prove that she had a right to do it.

Id: [0x0022C821]
If anyone did, it was <i>mater</i>. Her brothers were champions, as I am now. No one honors the Olympics like her.

Id: [0x0022C822]
Thank you. Sit tight, and I'll prove your mother was in her right to attend the Games.

Id: [0x0022C823]
Your mother told me you're competing in the Olympics.

Id: [0x0022C824]
Just like my grandfather, the great Diagoras himself.

Id: [0x0022C83A]
Do you know Kallipateira?

Id: [0x0022C83B]
I seen that one, all right. Always hanging round the athletes' tents. Disgraceful, if you know what I mean.

Id: [0x0022C83C]
I'm not sure I do.

Id: [0x0022C83D]
All those young, oiled, rippling bodies. Gives you shivers. Muscles everywhere! Ahem, disgusting it is, and her a married woman and all.

Id: [0x0022C83E]
Do you know Kallipateira?

Id: [0x0022C841]
Hmm... I don't know her well, but she dotes on her son - and she's always making offerings.

Id: [0x0022C842]
Offerings?

Id: [0x0022C843]
For her husband. She's a pious woman. He's long since crossed the Styx, and she misses him terribly... But we all have our time.

Id: [0x0022C844]
Thank you. You've been a great help.

Id: [0x0022C849]
You've had enough time. She was caught. She is guilty. The gods demand justice.

Id: [0x0022C84B]
The gods are appeased.

Id: [0x0022C885]
Their corruption, their reach - it's limitless. They're watching that shipwreck[2105455], and I don't doubt they're watching you.

Id: [0x0022C88C]
There's no way I was followed. I made sure of it.

Id: [0x0022C88D]
You covered every track?

Id: [0x0022C895]
Don't just stand there - please, help! They're - they're going to kill me!

Id: [0x0022C897]
Even I can't be completely sure I wasn't followed.

Id: [0x0022C89B]
It's not just important, <i>misthios</i> - this is a sacred sacrificial blade. These markings... This weapon's used to make sacrifices to Achilles. Find the right temple of Achilles, and you'll find The Dagger.

Id: [0x0022C89D]
A power-mad captain, civil unrest - sounds like serious work.

Id: [0x0022C8CE]
The crowd could cheer for you, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0022C8DF]
I see.

Id: [0x0022C8FB]
These walls could be echoing with chants of your name, <i>misthios</i>. Will you fight in the arena?

Id: [0x0022C91C]
You're a member of the Cult? If that's true, then you know who I am.

Id: [0x0022C91D]
You could. Of course if I'm killed, the slave stays that way... and I'm the only one who knows where his papers are.

Id: [0x0022C91F]
Most people prefer to keep their Cult status a secret.

Id: [0x0022C920]
You can't do a thing about it if you want to help... whatever his name is. Also, it adds a bit more fun to the situation, don't you think?

Id: [0x0022C921]
Then it's time we turn this predator into prey.

Id: [0x0022C92D]
You found the evidence you were looking for?

Id: [0x0022C92E]
We are gathered here today to carry out the will of the gods. To carry out <i>justice</i>.

Id: [0x0022C92F]
Please, you must believe me.

Id: [0x0022C930]
Wait!

Id: [0x0022C933]
Soldiers need two things to fight. Swords in their hands and food in their bellies. Take them away, and the guards fall.

Id: [0x0022C935]
Yes. Kallipateira is the daughter of Diagoras. I found the poem of <i>Diagoras of Rhodes</i> dedicated to the family by Pindar.

Id: [0x0022C936]
And this proves her story?

Id: [0x0022C937]
I talked to her son and people who know her. She is a good woman who loves the Games and respects the gods. Her family has turned out champions for three generations.

Id: [0x0022C938]
Perhaps we have judged her too harshly. Her family has been a credit to the Olympic legacy.

Id: [0x0022C939]
As you say, it would be a shame to tarnish such a proud family name.

Id: [0x0022C93A]
Thank you, thank you.

Id: [0x0022C93C]
And thank <i>you</i>.

Id: [0x0022C93E]
Nobody deserves such a fate.

Id: [0x0022C944]
There isn't enough evidence to prove her innocence. In fact, I even found some to the contrary.

Id: [0x0022C945]
Then justice must be served.

Id: [0x0022C948]
For your time in this matter, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022C962]
No, I swear!

Id: [0x0022C966]
This woman has disrespected the gods and shown contempt for tradition.

Id: [0x0022C967]
Please, I only wanted to see my son compete.

Id: [0x0022C968]
You mean you wanted to gaze lustfully upon the bodies of the athletes!

Id: [0x0022C989]
Shame! Shame!

Id: [0x0022C98D]
Hmm, the poem Diagoras of Rhodes... Dedicated by Pindar himself… To K, always be proud, little one. Your father is the greatest of pankration champions.

Id: [0x0022C994]
The danger has passed for now, but while those monsters are out there, no one is safe.

Id: [0x0022C995]
A group of fishermen tied you up. They were being used by a snake dealer working for enemies of Athens.

Id: [0x0022C996]
What did you do with them?

Id: [0x0022C99A]
I gave them what the gods demanded. Justice.

Id: [0x0022C99B]
The punishment seems fair... Still, it pains me to see sons and daughters of Athens turning against one another.

Id: [0x0022C99C]
They tried to kill you. If I hadn't arrived when I did, they would have succeeded.

Id: [0x0022C99D]
Thank you for your help,<i> misthios</i>. I'll be sure to mention it to Perikles.

Id: [0x0022C99F]
I showed them the error of their ways and sent them on their way. They won't be bothering you again.

Id: [0x0022C9A0]
I'm glad no blood was shed, but how do you know they won't return?

Id: [0x0022C9A1]
I made it very clear that doing anything stupid would make me angry.

Id: [0x0022C9A2]
Well that must have been a terrifying experience for them. Thank you for your help, <i>misthios</i>. I'll be sure to mention this to Perikles.

Id: [0x0022C9A7]
What's this? "I have always longed for you..." Kallipateira has an admirer.

Id: [0x0022C9AC]
That must be the door Herodotos mentioned.

Id: [0x0022C9B8]
Welcome aboard the Adrestia, Herodotos! Will you be traveling with us?

Id: [0x0022C9B9]
Only for a short trip. I have business to attend to in Athens.

Id: [0x0022C9BA]
Herodotos is helping me find my mother.

Id: [0x0022C9BB]
Seeking help from the gods has put Herodotos on your path, just like they put you on mine. They work in ways beyond our comprehension, and all we can do is follow their lead.

Id: [0x0022C9BC]
You could be right. Herodotos and I share enemies, too.

Id: [0x0022C9BD]
Like Elpenor?

Id: [0x0022C9BE]
He is - was - part of a very powerful group called the Cult of Kosmos that controls the Greek world through the Oracle.

Id: [0x0022C9BF]
Control the Oracle! Impossible. Apollo would <i>not</i> allow that.

Id: [0x0022C9C0]
Now they are looking for my mother. I need to find her before they do.

Id: [0x0022C9C1]
And I believe they will hurt others who oppose their views along the way.

Id: [0x0022C9C2]
By Hermes... The Oracle lost to corruption, and now this Cult? Do we know who leads them?

Id: [0x0022C9C3]
I don't know for sure but... I think it might be my brother.

Id: [0x0022C9C4]
Your brother?! By Zeus, your life is complicated.

Id: [0x0022C9C5]
Tell me about it.

Id: [0x0022C9C6]
But don't you worry! This Cult of Kosmos now has three new enemies. And one of them fights like Athena and shits thunder like Zeus! We’ll bring the wrath of the gods down upon them.

Id: [0x0022C9C7]
Is he always this positive?

Id: [0x0022C9C8]
Always. That’s why I like him.

Id: [0x0022C9C9]
Poseidon carry us to Athens!

Id: [0x0022C9CA]
First we need to go to Andros.

Id: [0x0022C9CB]
To Andros, then!

Id: [0x0022C9D1]
Thank you, <i>misthios, </i>for proving my connection to the great Diagoras.

Id: [0x0022CA00]
There's the ostraka. Now time to swap them.

Id: [0x0022CA07]
Tough crowd.

Id: [0x0022CA1B]
This is nice.

Id: [0x0022CA1D]
Having us all together, I mean.

Id: [0x0022CA1E]
Not all of us.

Id: [0x0022CA20]
But we have each other.

Id: [0x0022CA30]
This looks like somewhere Kleon would come.

Id: [0x0022CA36]
Ah, the mighty <i>misthios</i>. You proved yourself capable before... I could use your talents. One like you is always interested in more <i>drachmae</i>, yes?

Id: [0x0022CA3D]
The mighty <i>misthios</i>. Why bother me again?

Id: [0x0022CA3E]
Gotarzes... I feel I should make it up to you.

Id: [0x0022CA3F]
There's nothing you can do to make up for... Well, hmm. Perhaps.

Id: [0x0022CA7B]
Always happy to hear the clink of drachmae. Tell me what you want.

Id: [0x0022CAA4]
We've received word that a detachment of Spartans is approaching our camp.

Id: [0x0022CAA5]
Isn't it your job to deal with them?

Id: [0x0022CAA6]
We have orders to hold our position no matter what. We can't go out to meet them. And I hate waiting.

Id: [0x0022CAAE]
Payment is well and good. But I'm happy to help you. Tell me what you're thinking.

Id: [0x0022CAE0]
Bandits are picking at our supplies like crows! How am I supposed to maintain morale when even they don't respect us?

Id: [0x0022CAE1]
You're armed, why don't you deal with them?

Id: [0x0022CAE2]
Our position is weak. If the locals see us kill civilians, we'll have a revolt on our hands.

Id: [0x0022CAFC]
Those <i>malákes</i> Spartans captured my son! They're holding him hostage until we surrender.

Id: [0x0022CB02]
You could surrender. After all, your son's life must be worth more than this battle.

Id: [0x0022CB03]
Are you making fun of me? Of course we'll never surrender.

Id: [0x0022CB05]
There's an easy solution, then. Fight your way into their camp and free him.

Id: [0x0022CB06]
You think I haven't thought of that?

Id: [0x0022CB08]
Do you have a better plan?

Id: [0x0022CB09]
The Spartans have lookouts everywhere. If they see an armed Athenian coming, their commander will kill my son.

Id: [0x0022CB0A]
Sounds like a delicate situation.

Id: [0x0022CB0B]
For my troops and me, yes. But a <i>misthios</i> has more options.

Id: [0x0022CB18]
Thief!

Id: [0x0022CB19]
You're one to talk, you double-dealing dog.

Id: [0x0022CB1D]
Kassandra! Come, help me sort these fools out.

Id: [0x0022CB26]
This isn't something I can fix.

Id: [0x0022CB43]
I've traveled a long way to meet my real father. You.

Id: [0x0022CB46]
You weren't sent here for a family reunion. There are bigger things at stake.

Id: [0x0022CB74]
Your father was living in a volcano?

Id: [0x0022CB77]
That's right. Show your true colors. You Dorians are nothing but thugs.

Id: [0x0022CB78]
Why you Ionian...

Id: [0x0022CB79]
Please, stay calm. Remember the truce!

Id: [0x0022CB7B]
I never believed even you could sink so low.

Id: [0x0022CB7C]
Don't act pious with me. I should break your neck for this.

Id: [0x0022CB7E]
Insatiable.

Id: [0x0022CB7F]
Yes! "His insatiable thirst for power."

Id: [0x0022CBEB]
The Athenian army is bleeding soldiers! I can't have deserters stirring up the locals or worse - joining the Spartans.

Id: [0x0022CC0A]
Someone has stolen our coin.

Id: [0x0022CC0B]
Your troop's drachmae? That is a problem.

Id: [0x0022CC0C]
No, just one coin. But it was blessed by a priestess. It brought us luck.

Id: [0x0022CC0D]
You believe that?

Id: [0x0022CC0E]
My soldiers do. So until we get it back or punish the thief, I've got a problem on my hands.

Id: [0x0022CC1B]
If you don't stop, I'll kill you both to preserve the truce.

Id: [0x0022CC1C]
Nobody wants trouble here - you know what will happen to you both if you break the truce.

Id: [0x0022CC1D]
Kassandra please, if these fools break the truce...

Id: [0x0022CC28]
You call it Atlantis, but what exactly is this place?

Id: [0x0022CC2C]
Myrrine, my mother - she sent me here to find you.

Id: [0x0022CC2E]
Myrrine. She sent you here because she knew this was your destiny.

Id: [0x0022CC2F]
My destiny?

Id: [0x0022CC30]
There's more at stake than any one mind can comprehend.

Id: [0x0022CC33]
My troops are rattled. They hear the wolves howling at night and think it's their doom.

Id: [0x0022CC39]
If you pray to Ares or Apollo, they might send these wolves away.

Id: [0x0022CC3E]
I'm sure your soldiers are capable of killing a few wolves.

Id: [0x0022CC47]
Enough. I'll ask the questions.

Id: [0x0022CC48]
Now if someone can tell me what's going on...

Id: [0x0022CC49]
This dishonorable cur stole from me.

Id: [0x0022CC4A]
You call me a thief? You're the thief!

Id: [0x0022CC54]
My soldiers' health is failing! The gods are punishing them with sickness.

Id: [0x0022CC55]
Hippokrates would say you should look for another cause. Maybe their food is bad?

Id: [0x0022CC56]
Their food is fine.

Id: [0x0022CC57]
Is it the same food you eat?

Id: [0x0022CC58]
Of course not, I'm an officer.

Id: [0x0022CC59]
I see. Well, maybe there's a treatment that could help your soldiers.

Id: [0x0022CC5A]
Perhaps. I've heard about an herbalist. I tried to find her, but the locals tell me she and all her medicine went missing after the last bandit raid.

Id: [0x0022CC6B]
We're supposed to face the Spartan threat, but our transport is blocked by pirates. We could face them on land, but our ship's not prepared for a naval battle.

Id: [0x0022CC77]
A Spartan commander tore down our shrine to Athena and built one to Ares in its place! What an impious wretch.

Id: [0x0022CC94]
I've seen a familiar merchant vessel around here. The captain cheated us back when we desperately needed supplies.

Id: [0x0022CC95]
Sounds like a <i>malákas</i>. Why don't you go after that ship?

Id: [0x0022CC96]
We've got our orders - we can't engage with civilian vessels. But they don't say anything about hiring a <i>misthios</i> to take care of them instead.

Id: [0x0022CC9F]
We've survived many hard-won battles, thank Ares. But now so many of our weapons are broken that we might not make it through the next.

Id: [0x0022CCA0]
Where do you plan to get more weapons?

Id: [0x0022CCA1]
There's a blacksmith not far from here. He knows me well. I've written up an order for him to fill.

Id: [0x0022CCB6]
By Hera! Why does everything have to be so difficult? We've received orders to expand our camp, but we can't leave this territory undefended.

Id: [0x0022CCB7]
Sounds like you need to send out a scouting party.

Id: [0x0022CCB8]
I did. Only one soldier came back - the fastest runner among them.

Id: [0x0022CCB9]
Were they attacked by Spartans? Bandits?

Id: [0x0022CCBA]
Lions. Even wild beasts want to destroy us.

Id: [0x0022CCCA]
That Spartan lowlife finally got what was coming to 'em! We won! Yeah!

Id: [0x0022CCCB]
Congratulations.

Id: [0x0022CCCC]
You know what we gotta do now? Celebrate! We got wine, we got music, we got food... No wait, we ate everything already.

Id: [0x0022CCCD]
That could be a problem.

Id: [0x0022CCCE]
You know what would be nice? A great big, juicy roasted goat. And you know what we got? We got... fire!

Id: [0x0022CCD6]
My house.

Id: [0x0022CCDA]
Filthy Spartan dogs locked up a man I served with after they took over. My orders are to stay out of it... But he was like a brother to me.

Id: [0x0022CCE0]
If he's truly your friend, then you can't abandon him.

Id: [0x0022CCE1]
I can't compromise my position. I know that. [beat]But a mercenary such as yourself has no position to compromise.

Id: [0x0022CCE3]
Other lives are at stake when a spy compromises his position.

Id: [0x0022CCE4]
You're right. I can't leave my post. [beat]But a mercenary like you has no post to abandon.

Id: [0x0022CCF5]
But there are people standing in my way I must take care of first, and I think winning the Battle of One Hundred hands will help.

Id: [0x0022CCFB]
Yes, but I'm certain you feel something as the crowd chants for you.

Id: [0x0022CCFD]
Ah, misthios. I knew it as soon as I laid eyes on you. You could be - could be - Hero of the Arena like Skoura. If you keep fighting, I foresee a long and profitable career... for both of us.

Id: [0x0022CCFF]
Talk to Skoura when you're ready to continue.

Id: [0x0022CD07]
<i>You're a slave?!</i>

Id: [0x0022CD8A]
Yes.

Id: [0x0022CDD4]
I can be stealthy!

Id: [0x0022CDD5]
You have horns.

Id: [0x0022CDDB]
...<i>Pater</i>?!

Id: [0x0022CDE0]
[&ah]...[&ah]Hi honey.

Id: [0x0022CDE1]
I think you make a handsome Minotaur.

Id: [0x0022CDE3]
I know, darling. I know.

Id: [0x0022CDE8]
How could you even see out of that thing?

Id: [0x0022CDEA]
[&laughs]People keep asking me that...

Id: [0x0022CDF8]
Perhaps there <i>are</i> some heroes here.

Id: [0x0022CDFA]
No! That's not - I -

Id: [0x0022CDFB]
<i>Quiet</i>. Give the true hero the reward she deserves.

Id: [0x0022CE00]
<i>Misthios</i>, over here! It's me, Leiandros, the friendly Minotaur in the bushes!

Id: [0x0022CE05]
Don't be afraid, it's not the real Minotaur - it's only me, Leiandros!

Id: [0x0022CE0B]
Mortals, you are no match for... [projected]the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0022CE1F]
Not even Theseus could kill me!

Id: [0x0022CE22]
<i>Bleed</i>, mortals!

Id: [0x0022CE25]
Your injustice will be trampled!

Id: [0x0022CE29]
Bring me your delicious human flesh!

Id: [0x0022CE2B]
Hmm. Perhaps I'm getting just a little <i>too </i>into character...

Id: [0x0022CE2D]
Rooooooooooar!!!

Id: [0x0022CE30]
Mooooooo!!!

Id: [0x0022CE39]
I wasn't talking about fighting.

Id: [0x0022CE3A]
I know, and I'm tempted.

Id: [0x0022CE3B]
Shields have never stopped me.

Id: [0x0022CE3C]
You're a bold one, <i>misthios</i>. But Kyra needs us.

Id: [0x0022CE45]
Kassandra, there’s a question I’ve been meaning to ask you.

Id: [0x0022CE48]
Go on.

Id: [0x0022CE4B]
Your spear. How did you find it?

Id: [0x0022CE4F]
My mother told me that the Spartan army brought it back from the Battle of Thermopylai.

Id: [0x0022CE52]
Why bring it back to <i>her</i>?

Id: [0x0022CE55]
Leonidas was her father.

Id: [0x0022CE5E]
Incredible... And it gives you visions. Perhaps it’s trying to guide you? Show you a path?

Id: [0x0022CE67]
There’s more. It helps me in battle.

Id: [0x0022CE6A]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0022CE6E]
I can’t really describe it... It’s like I know what my opponent’s next move will be, just before it happens.

Id: [0x0022CE71]
Fascinating... This is just extraordinary...

Id: [0x0022CE75]
I have questions about my family.

Id: [0x0022CE76]
The sentimental and emotional connections formed between people have always irked me. I knew Myrrine would fail to stay detached.

Id: [0x0022CE78]
I want to know more about Atlantis and your work.

Id: [0x0022CE79]
There isn't enough time for me to explain even a fraction of what I have learned here. All I can offer for now is a hint of enlightenment.

Id: [0x0022CE7B]
What do I do with the artifacts?

Id: [0x0022CE7C]
Just place them in their corresponding steles, and the path to answers will illuminate.

Id: [0x0022CE7F]
Time for me to go.

Id: [0x0022CE89]
My heart beats faster, <i>misthios</i>. [beat]But...

Id: [0x0022CE8C]
Spartans! Many brothers were lost to the Athenian dogs. But we are still here!

Id: [0x0022CE8E]
Today we honor the fallen. Today we send our enemies to Hades!

Id: [0x0022CE90]
Kyra will fight and die for her people. We will do the same!

Id: [0x0022CE91]
We don't go home until these islands are ours. Delos called. Sparta answered!

Id: [0x0022CE96]
I've heard enough.

Id: [0x0022CE9F]
Eurydike... He had to know I've met her before. What do I do?

Id: [0x0022CEAA]
I said <i>Herodotos</i>!

Id: [0x0022CEAB]
If there's been a theft, why do you suspect each other?

Id: [0x0022CEAD]
Because this...

Id: [0x0022CEAF]
Herodotos, what's all this about?

Id: [0x0022CEB0]
This scum robbed me!

Id: [0x0022CEB1]
Scum! I'm from an honorable family. Only a lowly Ionian would steal.

Id: [0x0022CEB2]
Er, yes. It seems both their treasuries[2181944] were breached, and their valuables stolen.

Id: [0x0022CEBD]
While Lelex is from Ionian stock, a grand tradition of artists and philosophers -

Id: [0x0022CEBE]
Both sides are important.

Id: [0x0022CEBF]
Spoken like a true Ionian.

Id: [0x0022CEC0]
It's a matter of blood. Makar is from an eminent Dorian line. Mighty warriors, but rather austere...

Id: [0x0022CEC1]
You mean philanderers.

Id: [0x0022CEC5]
Please, if the mystery of who robbed Lelex and Makar isn't solved, I fear there will be bloodshed.

Id: [0x0022CEE0]
There's something I'm missing. I need to keep looking.

Id: [0x0022CEE1]
Hurry, they are at each other's throats.

Id: [0x0022CEEA]
It seems unlikely they would rob each other at the same time.

Id: [0x0022CEEB]
You have to find out who stole their drachmae. I can't believe they would do this to each other. Whatever their issues, they've always respected the Olympic truce.

Id: [0x0022CEEE]
That must be Hippokrates and his patients.

Id: [0x0022CEF4]
But if I sink enough ships, the Spartans can get through.

Id: [0x0022CEF5]
There's something else. A helmet was left on board my ship. It was my pater's.

Id: [0x0022CEF6]
The Battle of the Three Hundred? Leonidas was lucky to have that many men!

Id: [0x0022CF07]
Hippokrates's notes are well guarded. Why?

Id: [0x0022CF13]
That's the man Hippokrates mentioned... but he's hiding.

Id: [0x0022CF1F]
The Archon's family! They won't stay hidden in there for long.

Id: [0x0022CF30]
I've found the Archon.

Id: [0x0022CF3C]
There's Pausanias. <i>Maláka</i>.

Id: [0x0022CF54]
Those must be the caves Photios wanted me to check.

Id: [0x0022CF5D]
BEWARE BEAST! For soon I shall use your spinal column as an eating utensil!

Id: [0x0022CF5E]
Don't warn him.

Id: [0x0022CF63]
...If the Minotaur eats humans <i>and</i> lives right next to the population of Pephka, how are they all still alive?

Id: [0x0022CF64]
Perhaps the diet of Pephkans disagrees with him?

Id: [0x0022CF65]
Good thinking, brother! Let us dip our blades in  rich oils and onions to gain an edge in combat!

Id: [0x0022CF6A]
I hear the Minotaur was slain by Theseus.

Id: [0x0022CF6B]
Impossible! If Theseus killed the Minotaur, how can it be here?

Id: [0x0022CF70]
Look, a warrior whose bravery may nearly equals our own!

Id: [0x0022CF71]
Join us, slightly-less-than-equal warrior!

Id: [0x0022CF75]
I should go.

Id: [0x0022CF76]
Yes, there is much to do. Bring back the artifacts quickly. The longer we wait, the greater the risk of Atlantis being discovered.

Id: [0x0022CF8C]
I don't understand. There's no change that I see. It's the same place as when we first arrived.

Id: [0x0022CF90]
I'll sink the ships, but I'm not making any promises about a helmet.

Id: [0x0022CF97]
This is your last chance to flee, mortal!

Id: [0x0022CF9F]
Behold brother; the home of the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0022CFA0]
Isn't he supposed to live in a labyrinth?

Id: [0x0022CFA1]
That's a myth.

Id: [0x0022CFA2]
Isn't the <i>Minotaur</i> a myth?

Id: [0x0022CFA3]
No, he's the half-bull, half-human bastard son of King Minos's wife.

Id: [0x0022CFA4]
...Sounds like a myth to me.

Id: [0x0022CFAB]
Is that him, brother?! He sounds large! I thought he was a <i>mini-</i>taur... Perhaps we should courageously flee?

Id: [0x0022CFAC]
No, no, brother - onwards, into the dark!

Id: [0x0022CFB1]
There's no glory here... only death.

Id: [0x0022CFBA]
No-no-no! I only ever wanted to be a baker!

Id: [0x0022CFBC]
Brother! Wait! There's more glory in beast-slaying that in bread-making!

Id: [0x0022CFC5]
Uh, I should check on my brother. The baking business is fierce, you know!

Id: [0x0022CFC7]
Good luuuuuuck!

Id: [0x0022CFCE]
And what if it's neither of you?

Id: [0x0022CFD0]
Very well.

Id: [0x0022CFD1]
Agreed.

Id: [0x0022CFD3]
I'll find out what happened and protect the truce.

Id: [0x0022CFD4]
If you prove it's Makar, I will reward you well.

Id: [0x0022CFD5]
As will I, if you bring me evidence of Lelex's double dealing.

Id: [0x0022CFD6]
Then they will <i>both</i> reward you.

Id: [0x0022CFE2]
That must be the bandit camp I'm looking for.

Id: [0x0022CFED]
I don't need to get involved in other people's family feuds.

Id: [0x0022CFF5]
You amateurs are wasting my time.

Id: [0x0022CFFA]
If I never eat another apple -

Id: [0x0022CFFB]
Roxana is training outside her house! She's fighting everyone!

Id: [0x0022CFFD]
Let's go.

Id: [0x0022D003]
This is Roxana's year. She's going to win the Battle of One Hundred Hands for sure.

Id: [0x0022D004]
What? She doesn't even have an official training partner.

Id: [0x0022D005]
It's because she's too good for any of them!

Id: [0x0022D00A]
Roxana nearly killed my son when they sparred this week.

Id: [0x0022D00B]
He's lucky. Had it been in the Battle she <i>would </i>have killed him.

Id: [0x0022D00C]
...Yeah.

Id: [0x0022D011]
You've got to be faster.

Id: [0x0022D012]
Roxana's going to kill him.

Id: [0x0022D017]
Ooh. That hurt.

Id: [0x0022D044]
Hello, eye. I see you.

Id: [0x0022D049]
Go!

Id: [0x0022D04E]
One of your fellow mercenaries has disappointed me. I hired that weasel to steal Spartan plans. But it's been days, and I still don't have them.

Id: [0x0022D054]
That's no good. I hope your <i>misthios</i> didn't get captured - or worse.

Id: [0x0022D056]
Can't say I've seen that happen... except when the person doing the hiring doesn't pay well.

Id: [0x0022D058]
That's not my problem. But as much as I hate sending good drachmae after bad, you might be my only solution if I ever want to get my hands on those plans. [beat]Or keep the wrong hands off them.

Id: [0x0022D07B]
A temple on top of the Akrokorinth... That's what I'm looking for.

Id: [0x0022D082]
Hmm, a note. "Take all that you can carry, and meet me at the ruins where we first consummated our love. Soon we will be free."

Id: [0x0022D089]
Theses crypts have been opened. There's no sign of forced entry.

Id: [0x0022D08D]
Nothing's happening. It's only dust in my eyes.

Id: [0x0022D08E]
Really? [beat]We are a pair, aren't we? I feel ashamed to think that I was hoping for more. Knowledge is reward enough.

Id: [0x0022D08F]
It's good armor. You know, Eppie? I think maybe you should carry on your journey.

Id: [0x0022D090]
Should I? Hmm. Well, there are other clues to follow.

Id: [0x0022D097]
It was perhaps some kind of library where the ancient ones stored information.

Id: [0x0022D09D]
You there! Misthios! Yes, you!

Id: [0x0022D0C5]
This must be Gorgias's apprentice. What a mess.

Id: [0x0022D0C8]
Hmm, no emblem.

Id: [0x0022D0CD]
Whatever mauled Pibos must be big... Maybe it has the amulet?

Id: [0x0022D0D1]
This must be Pibos - or what's left of him.

Id: [0x0022D0D5]
The creature that killed Pibos must have eaten the amulet.

Id: [0x0022D0D9]
A camp. Gorgias must be nearby.

Id: [0x0022D0DC]
He must be the one Pythagoras mentioned.

Id: [0x0022D0E0]
Cultists. Something tore them to pieces.

Id: [0x0022D0E4]
Must have been a big creature to cause this much carnage. I need to be careful.

Id: [0x0022D0F2]
My troops are well, thanks to a local physician. Though he left without even asking for payment.

Id: [0x0022D0F8]
Sounds like someone touched by the teachings of Hippokrates.

Id: [0x0022D0FA]
How foolish. Even Hippokrates asks for donations from those who can afford it.

Id: [0x0022D0FC]
The physician did mention studying under Hippokrates. All the same, it would be dishonorable to let such dedication go unrewarded. I'd like to get this payment to him, but I can't leave my post.

Id: [0x0022D106]
The room has come to life. The gods are speaking to us.

Id: [0x0022D107]
How can that be? Why can't I see any of this? Why should the gods not present themselves to me?

Id: [0x0022D108]
I promise you, I have no idea.

Id: [0x0022D109]
Is it because I'm not worthy? Do you have inner vision? It isn't fair.

Id: [0x0022D12E]
The Spartans have been fighting us for ages without tiring. But I found out their secret!

Id: [0x0022D12F]
Strict discipline and constant training?

Id: [0x0022D130]
It's the soup! Their black blood soup is vile but gives them endless energy.

Id: [0x0022D136]
I've tried that soup, it's no more nourishing than any other. If anything, it makes the Spartan soldiers angry.

Id: [0x0022D138]
You figured it out, sir. Pigs' feet boiled in blood and vinegar is warrior food.

Id: [0x0022D13A]
That's what makes them so determined! The Spartan camp that's attacking us has made so much of that soup, we can smell it all the way from here. They set up a stockpile.

Id: [0x0022D13B]
A stockpile?

Id: [0x0022D13C]
You heard me. But they've also hired a mercenary to bring them more ingredients. A devious plan indeed.

Id: [0x0022D143]
The spear's in that cave... somewhere.

Id: [0x0022D1C8]
Layla, are you still feeling well? Talk to me.

Id: [0x0022D1C9]
I'm fine, Doctor. Just making my way into the Isu temple.

Id: [0x0022D1CB]
Well, whatever you call it, I'm going to find my way there. It's not like the Isu put up signs leading to the gift shop.

Id: [0x0022D1D4]
I - I came for another reason.

Id: [0x0022D1D5]
Oh? Then tell me, little one. Why are you here?

Id: [0x0022D1D7]
What [beat]are you?

Id: [0x0022D1D8]
The Sphinx. The guardian of truth and knowledge.

Id: [0x0022D1D9]
Why are you here?

Id: [0x0022D1DA]
The gods sent me to protect something, and I've been its guardian ever since.

Id: [0x0022D1F6]
Ahh, Pephka, the land of champions, is straight ahead!

Id: [0x0022D1F7]
The land of champions?

Id: [0x0022D1F8]
Yes! Glory and drachmae! The best warriors from the four corners of the Aegean Sea come here to fight in the Arena.

Id: [0x0022D1F9]
An arena, hm? I’ll be sure to take a closer look.

Id: [0x0022D1FA]
Spoken like a true champion. Those Pephkans will be no match for you!

Id: [0x0022D201]
We are approaching the island of Andros, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022D202]
Yes! Here we can see the tomb of the greatest Myrmidon, Achilles!

Id: [0x0022D203]
I was more excited by the fact that Andros exports some of the most expensive marble in the world.

Id: [0x0022D204]
Is this the place with the rumored ancient civilization ruins you were talking about?

Id: [0x0022D205]
Indeed it is. Look for a large gate.

Id: [0x0022D207]
Well actually, my hypothesis is that these aren't Isu <i>temples</i> at all. These structures seem to be used for data storage, research... Just about anything but worship.

Id: [0x0022D208]
Temples are built for more than worship.

Id: [0x0022D212]
Herodotos, what’s that island ahead of us?

Id: [0x0022D213]
That, my friend, is the famous island of Salamis.

Id: [0x0022D214]
The place where Athens defeated the Persians?

Id: [0x0022D215]
It’s in this bay that the great Athenian strategos Themistokles destroyed the Persian fleet and saved the Greek world from annihilation.

Id: [0x0022D216]
This isn't meant for <i>you</i>.

Id: [0x0022D217]
Who are you to decide?

Id: [0x0022D218]
It isn't my decision. But I know that neither of us can know what the gods want with us.

Id: [0x0022D21B]
I have value, too!

Id: [0x0022D21C]
Calm yourself. I have no control over this. You have your discovery. That should satisfy you.

Id: [0x0022D244]
I don't think I'll find answers over here.

Id: [0x0022D249]
This doesn't seem right.

Id: [0x0022D24F]
It's dark in here. I should light my torch.

Id: [0x0022D254]
Not so dark anymore.

Id: [0x0022D25B]
I've never seen structures like this before.

Id: [0x0022D260]
Guess I've got to take a leap of faith.

Id: [0x0022D268]
The bay of Marathon is ahead!

Id: [0x0022D269]
Marathon...

Id: [0x0022D26A]
You know, the battle where a handful of Athenians pushed back the first Persian invasion?

Id: [0x0022D26B]
Hmm...

Id: [0x0022D26C]
The great Themistokles? King Darius of Persia?

Id: [0x0022D26D]
I'm not sure -

Id: [0x0022D26E]
The site where the great Theseus slayed the vicious Kretan Bull!

Id: [0x0022D26F]
Oh! That Marathon!

Id: [0x0022D270]
[sigh]You're both hopeless...

Id: [0x0022D274]
Time to take a dive.

Id: [0x0022D27B]
You look troubled, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022D27C]
This bay feels... familiar somehow.

Id: [0x0022D27D]
A bird can fly away for seasons, but will always recognize its nest when it returns. [beat]This is Sparta.

Id: [0x0022D27E]
I don't think I’m welcome here.

Id: [0x0022D281]
I’m not sure of much, Kassandra, but I do know that when the time is right, we always get to go home.

Id: [0x0022D282]
And where is your home, Barnabas?

Id: [0x0022D283]
I'll save that story for another day.

Id: [0x0022D285]
So the helmet from your <i>pater</i> means a lot to you?

Id: [0x0022D286]
It does. He pried it from his <i>pater</i> on the battlefield of Thermopylai.

Id: [0x0022D28C]
Talking in circles may work on others, Sokrates, but not on me.

Id: [0x0022D28D]
I don't speak in circles, or any other shape. You answered one of my questions, and that brought another to mind.

Id: [0x0022D28E]
And another... And another...

Id: [0x0022D2BA]
That light... Could that be the staff?

Id: [0x0022D2CB]
Those light beams are intense. I wonder what they're supposed to light up?

Id: [0x0022D2CF]
That piece of equipment has a giant mirror on top.

Id: [0x0022D2D3]
I think I can move that equipment.

Id: [0x0022D2D7]
If I line up the mirrors just right, I should be able to direct the light beams.

Id: [0x0022D2DB]
Such a bright light. Its presence cannot be an accident.

Id: [0x0022D2DF]
Those pillars seem to have mirrors on them.

Id: [0x0022D2E3]
Layla, that pillar looks like it can move.

Id: [0x0022D2E7]
If you manipulate those light beams, they might illuminate something important.

Id: [0x0022D2ED]
That stuff is blocking the light beam. If I got it out of the way... Hmm.

Id: [0x0022D2F1]
I think the light beam is blocked, Layla.

Id: [0x0022D2F7]
We need keep away from the shoreline here.

Id: [0x0022D2F8]
Why?

Id: [0x0022D2F9]
Years ago, we found a dying man on the beach - arms ripped from his body, face scarred by terror... With his last breath, he warned of a beast who roams the woods near the shore.

Id: [0x0022D2FA]
A beast, really...

Id: [0x0022D2FB]
Yes, a monster! With big, red flaming eyes and a roar like Zeus’s thunder!

Id: [0x0022D2FC]
And, of course, you've seen it.

Id: [0x0022D2FF]
Like the gods, we've never seen them, but know they exist. You think Zeus doesn't exist? We can't see <i>him </i>with our own eyes!

Id: [0x0022D300]
Well of course, but -

Id: [0x0022D301]
[laughs]Herodotos, he’s got a point.

Id: [0x0022D308]
Argolis! The land of science and home to the legendary city of Argos.

Id: [0x0022D309]
I never thought I would get to see it with my own eyes.

Id: [0x0022D30A]
The tomb of King Agamemnon, the sanctuary of Asklepios, the old Minoan ruins! The history here is astounding.

Id: [0x0022D313]
There, his name's been signed. Time to get back to Alkibiades.

Id: [0x0022D316]
I have an appetite for rare treasures. I've heard many veiled rumors and provocative stories, and I want you to recover some of these lost wonders for me.

Id: [0x0022D31F]
The seas are treacherous around Keos. We should be careful.

Id: [0x0022D320]
What? Charybdis and Skylla await at the bottom of the sea, I suppose?

Id: [0x0022D321]
No. Pirates. A lot of them.

Id: [0x0022D322]
Huh. Only pirates?

Id: [0x0022D327]
Do you see that volcano?

Id: [0x0022D328]
It’s pretty hard to miss.

Id: [0x0022D329]
Some say there is an entrance to the underworld at the bottom.

Id: [0x0022D32A]
And what, you enter by diving in it?

Id: [0x0022D32B]
That's the spirit! [beat] A brave Arkadian I once knew had the same idea.

Id: [0x0022D32C]
And what happened to him?

Id: [0x0022D32D]
The heat of the flames turned him to ashes before he made it halfway down.

Id: [0x0022D32E]
I guess some mysteries are best left unexplored.

Id: [0x0022D330]
Tell me where to look, and I'll bring you these treasures.

Id: [0x0022D331]
Have you heard of the mighty Ajax?

Id: [0x0022D355]
Barnabas, what’s that large landmass up ahead?

Id: [0x0022D356]
It’s Krete, a land of mysteries and heroes. Theseus and the Minotaur! You know the story?

Id: [0x0022D357]
Parts of it. Theseus was an<i> Athenian</i> hero. [beat]It wasn't a very popular tale in Sparta.

Id: [0x0022D358]
Ah, but it’s an epic story! Theseus ventured into the labyrinth to slay the Minotaur. An unsurmountable task, yet he triumphed and saved the people of Minos.

Id: [0x0022D359]
I feel like Theseus and I share a common burden...

Id: [0x0022D35A]
Cheer up, Kassandra! The gods are on your side! When your task is accomplished, we’ll roast some lamb, drink wine, and I’ll tell you all the stories I know.

Id: [0x0022D35B]
I’m glad you’re here with me, Barnabas.

Id: [0x0022D35C]
I am blessed to be in <i>your</i> company, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0022D365]
You seem strangely excited, Herodotos.

Id: [0x0022D366]
We are getting near one of the most ancient regions of the world - the land of the Minoans. A truly fascinating and mysterious civilization. Geniuses ahead of their time.

Id: [0x0022D367]
Should I visit, then?

Id: [0x0022D368]
Only ruins remain of their civilization now. It has been lost for hundreds if not thousands of years.

Id: [0x0022D37D]
There's no harm in looking at an attractive man, is there?

Id: [0x0022D37E]
Yes, yes there is! You young ones, always thinking with what's between your legs, and she definitely was. Saw her meet a man regularly on that bench over there.

Id: [0x0022D37F]
You saw her meet a man? Thank you.

Id: [0x0022D385]
The mechanism should be open. What's wrong?

Id: [0x0022D388]
I don't know Layla, I'll check my notes on the Isu.

Id: [0x0022D38A]
Oh, I see it. There's a beam of light missing. Time to troubleshoot...

Id: [0x0022D3A5]
Did you see anything?

Id: [0x0022D3AC]
That was a pun, right? Enlightening, light beams?

Id: [0x0022D3AD]
I don't think the Isu saw us as rats. I think they wanted to teach us something really complex. But human consciousness is so different from theirs... Maybe this was their way of bridging the gap.

Id: [0x0022D3AF]
No, nope, not <i>nothing</i>. Far less than <i>anything</i>.

Id: [0x0022D3B0]
So you saw something.

Id: [0x0022D3B1]
Well, only if you count torches. [beat]But they crept up on me, they did. Must've been at least thirty of them.

Id: [0x0022D3B2]
Torches crept up on you? If there were thirty of them, why isn't the ground stomped flat?

Id: [0x0022D3B3]
Er... doeskin sandals, very soft. Don't leave a trace. [beat]Anyway, hard to tell how many, as I was unconscious.

Id: [0x0022D3BA]
Ugh...

Id: [0x0022D3BB]
Why did the Isu build so many puzzles?

Id: [0x0022D3BC]
Maybe it's a psychological test, like a rat maze. Observing how someone performs a frustrating task can be enlightening.

Id: [0x0022D3C1]
I got it!

Id: [0x0022D3C7]
Tell me the truth, or I'll beat it out of you. Are you the thief?

Id: [0x0022D3C8]
No, please. Look, it wasn't me. I fell asleep - didn't see anything apart from the torches.

Id: [0x0022D3CB]
It's all right if you ran. Fear can change a man.

Id: [0x0022D3CC]
I wasn't afraid, I was asleep... Oh, I mean...

Id: [0x0022D3CD]
Told you all I know. Torches were headed eastward.

Id: [0x0022D3D2]
I won't tell, but did you see anything?

Id: [0x0022D3D3]
No... Except...

Id: [0x0022D3D4]
Yes?

Id: [0x0022D3D5]
Some torches, heading east.

Id: [0x0022D3D8]
But you'd already been robbed!

Id: [0x0022D3D9]
If I deserted my post, I'd be charged with dereliction of duty.

Id: [0x0022D3DB]
Then I'll let you get back to work.

Id: [0x0022D3DC]
And you didn't investigate?

Id: [0x0022D3DD]
I didn't want to leave my post.

Id: [0x0022D3F7]
[&ah]Go, I'll do my best to distract the guards.

Id: [0x0022D3F8]
The Minotaur calls you! Come and face me! Show me your bravery...

Id: [0x0022D3FD]
Face me!

Id: [0x0022D403]
Where is your honor, you masked malákes?!

Id: [0x0022D408]
Look at me! Over here, everyone! It's the Minotaur! And he's - he's so angry, right now, at you?

Id: [0x0022D40D]
Then we're in great danger.

Id: [0x0022D43F]
You think a threat will stop us? Every day we're <i>worse</i> than threatened - we're beaten, abused. No, we don't bow to threats. We <i>fight</i>!

Id: [0x0022D445]
Should I use "any means necessary" to end this unrest?

Id: [0x0022D446]
Ever the <i>misthios</i>, where a blade is the answer to all things. Yes, one way to quell unrest is to kill everyone involved, but sometimes simply talking will yield the best results.

Id: [0x0022D447]
If the cause of all this is increased taxes, wouldn't it be easier to lower them?

Id: [0x0022D449]
Don't you know all of the Greek world is at war?! War is expensive, and Kydonia needs fleets! She needs armies! We cannot be left defenseless.

Id: [0x0022D44E]
Their masks... Their masks...

Id: [0x0022D455]
I didn't do anything. Let me go! Please... please...!

Id: [0x0022D45A]
No, please - I've been quiet! I haven't cried! I - I can be silent... Don't hurt me...

Id: [0x0022D45F]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Id: [0x0022D464]
Got to be quick, got to be quiet...

Id: [0x0022D473]
The abandoned house, and the people.

Id: [0x0022D47F]
The legendary shroud. Elpenor wasn't lying.

Id: [0x0022D492]
So, <i>thieves</i>, I finally catch you.

Id: [0x0022D494]
Please, we're not thieves.

Id: [0x0022D495]
Yet here you are with stolen goods.

Id: [0x0022D496]
You don't understand, this is rightfully ours. It's our inheritance.

Id: [0x0022D4A0]
Sophanes's name is on the list, but it came at a price.

Id: [0x0022D4A1]
I see. Sometimes blood must be shed... You were the right <i>misthios </i>for the job.

Id: [0x0022D4B2]
Death is coming for you, Elpenor.

Id: [0x0022D4B6]
Who are you, exactly?

Id: [0x0022D4B8]
<i>Pater</i>!

Id: [0x0022D4BA]
How can this all be yours?

Id: [0x0022D4BC]
It belongs to our families - by blood it's rightfully ours.

Id: [0x0022D4BD]
If it's already yours, why not wait? Why steal everything now?

Id: [0x0022D4BE]
We wanted a new life. One where we could be free, and our love doesn't have to hide in the shadows.

Id: [0x0022D4BF]
They are my daughter and his son!

Id: [0x0022D4C0]
This is how you repay me for raising you? By running off with some woman squirted from my enemy's loins?!

Id: [0x0022D4C8]
Why not put aside your feud, as your children have done?

Id: [0x0022D4D7]
This robbery has brought you together. Lelex, Makar, you worked together to find out what happened to your drachmae.

Id: [0x0022D4D8]
As yours did mine.

Id: [0x0022D4D9]
But think how much you could achieve working together.

Id: [0x0022D4DB]
You're a <i>misthios</i>. Carry out your duty and kill the thieves. I will pay you handsomely.

Id: [0x0022D4DC]
I agree. I will match Makar's price on this. Do what you were hired to do.

Id: [0x0022D4DD]
You would kill your own son and daughter?

Id: [0x0022D4DE]
We have other children. Now, are you a <i>misthios</i> or not?

Id: [0x0022D4E0]
Actually, the guard told us.

Id: [0x0022D4E1]
And his family stole my money.

Id: [0x0022D4E2]
<i>Pater</i>, no!

Id: [0x0022D4E5]
Where will I find this golden eagle feather?

Id: [0x0022D4E6]
Different tales place it at different locations. I have maps showing where you might find it.

Id: [0x0022D4EE]
A contract's a contract.

Id: [0x0022D4F8]
I will not slaughter innocents. Your families would stand a better chance for the future without the both of you.

Id: [0x0022D501]
I didn't want it to come to this, but now we can forge a new future for our two families - one built on love.

Id: [0x0022D502]
I wish you luck with that...

Id: [0x0022D514]
There wasn't.

Id: [0x0022D515]
The gods don't <i>care</i> what we do. Here, take your drachmae. It was well earned.

Id: [0x0022D516]
Good, the matter is settled.

Id: [0x0022D517]
I wish their could have been another way.

Id: [0x0022D518]
This blood is on your hands, not mine. May the gods forgive me.

Id: [0x0022D545]
Is that the only role you know? You present yourself one way, but it's as if you fear showing your true self.

Id: [0x0022D546]
I've told you, Sokrates, I'll gladly show you my <i>true</i> self. Just say the word.

Id: [0x0022D549]
My point is proven so easily.

Id: [0x0022D552]
You kept information from me - information that would have been nice to know.

Id: [0x0022D553]
I believe people like Sophanes deserve second chances. I didn't think what <i>he</i> did mattered to you.

Id: [0x0022D554]
Next time, let me decide what matters to me.

Id: [0x0022D555]
Understood. I should give Sophanes the news.

Id: [0x0022D558]
It's done.

Id: [0x0022D559]
So it is. I'll let Sophanes know what happened.

Id: [0x0022D568]
Are you going to be like this the whole time we're here?

Id: [0x0022D569]
By the gods, yes!

Id: [0x0022D56A]
I'll try and win quickly, then.

Id: [0x0022D56B]
Come now. You must be feeling something.

Id: [0x0022D56C]
[laugh]I'm just having fun with you. Who wouldn't be impressed?

Id: [0x0022D570]
Welcome to the Olympics! Breathe in. Can you not taste the excitement in the air?

Id: [0x0022D582]
There's her farm. I'll find the herbs there.

Id: [0x0022D596]
What can you tell me about Ajax's feather?

Id: [0x0022D597]
The son of Telamon was said to be a fearless giant. Some say the golden feather that gave him courage was woven into a shield crafted of seven ox hides.

Id: [0x0022D59F]
It is a place of immortal glory - you can be sure Hera and Zeus will be watching your performance closely.

Id: [0x0022D5A0]
Oh, no pressure, then.

Id: [0x0022D5A1]
[laugh]Forget that for the moment, and let's enjoy the sights and see what Olympia has to offer.

Id: [0x0022D5A6]
Hey, over here! Come on!

Id: [0x0022D5B0]
This will show those idiots in the assembly. We're making progress. Interested in getting rid of more polemarchs for me?

Id: [0x0022D5BA]
That priestess was in a hurry to carry out her sentence on Kallipateira. I should find them quickly.

Id: [0x0022D5C2]
I'll find this feather for you, if it's there to be found.

Id: [0x0022D5C3]
I have better things to do. Good luck with your Spartan seals.

Id: [0x0022D5C4]
What's so special about these seals?

Id: [0x0022D5CC]
The gods are with us today, Kassandra. The sea is calm, and the winds are warm.

Id: [0x0022D5CD]
It’s beautiful.

Id: [0x0022D5CE]
It is, my friend. It sure is.

Id: [0x0022D5D0]
I'll help but... we make a deal first.

Id: [0x0022D5D1]
That's what I'd expect from someone wise to the world.

Id: [0x0022D5D5]
The Adrestia was built to survive the worst storms and the toughest battles, but she was<i> meant</i> to sail on waters as glorious as this.

Id: [0x0022D5D9]
Days like this are a blessing from the gods.

Id: [0x0022D5DA]
It <i>is </i>a beautiful day.

Id: [0x0022D5DB]
Ah! The blue seas, the sunny sky, good companions, an exciting journey. [beat]This? This is the good life.

Id: [0x0022D5DD]
I have things to attend to. Continue your research, and I may return later.

Id: [0x0022D5E2]
Hold steady! Poseidon and Zeus are angry and must be feuding over who should sink the ship. We should have sacrificed a goat before leaving! 

Id: [0x0022D5E8]
Poseidon! Spare us!

Id: [0x0022D5E9]
Are you scared?

Id: [0x0022D5EC]
Why wouldn't I be scared? Poseidon is testing the Adrestia right now! Pray Athena she holds up!

Id: [0x0022D5F0]
I don’t feel very good.

Id: [0x0022D5F1]
Maláka! We should have made an offering to Poseidon before leaving.

Id: [0x0022D5F2]
Oh, I can make him an offering, all right...

Id: [0x0022D5F3]
What?

Id: [0x0022D5F5]
Next time, let's get a goat.

Id: [0x0022D5F8]
Have you decided to help me find the missing stele pieces?

Id: [0x0022D654]
You would! Yes, of course you would. Everyone wants their future told by the Great Ouzo!

Id: [0x0022D656]
Well, what is it?

Id: [0x0022D657]
I see great things...

Id: [0x0022D658]
Like what?

Id: [0x0022D659]
You know things, and... it's going to be sunny tomorrow.

Id: [0x0022D65B]
Thank you, thank you. Tell your friends.

Id: [0x0022D65D]
Whatever you say.

Id: [0x0022D667]
I call that impression "The Lap Dog." [beat]I wonder how many scraps Hermippos has received from Kleon's table?

Id: [0x0022D668]
Please, no. I was just trying to help. It's in your interest to keep them healthy and...

Id: [0x0022D669]
I don't need street scum like you telling me what's in my interest.

Id: [0x0022D66A]
You feel terrible about turning me down before, don't you?

Id: [0x0022D66E]
Did you forget what you're supposed to do, or did you just miss me?

Id: [0x0022D67A]
Please, I only wanted to help the children. Spare me, and I'll do better. I'll look after them all.

Id: [0x0022D681]
I haven't seen her celebrate with her troops since you revealed her past. She's gone to send her father to the Ferryman alone.

Id: [0x0022D6EA]
I heard. She's with her troops now. It's the first time I've seen them together since you told them the truth about her past. Still, burying Podarkes was the honorable thing.

Id: [0x0022D6FB]
That must be Spyro. Looks like a sturdy horse.

Id: [0x0022D6FD]
I hope you do. His residence would be a good place to start.

Id: [0x0022D706]
Where is she? I'm sure if she'd come, her troops would celebrate with her, no matter who her father was.

Id: [0x0022D70C]
Hermippos was nowhere to be found, but I did find he's joined some sort of cult.

Id: [0x0022D70D]
A cult? Well, I wouldn't put it past him, although I fail to understand why.

Id: [0x0022D710]
Hermippos is definitely a problem.

Id: [0x0022D715]
Don't tease me. If you have something you want from me, say it.

Id: [0x0022D71B]
You're right. They do need me. And I need them. We're rebels with nothing left to rebel against. They need me now more than ever.

Id: [0x0022D71E]
We all have complicated pasts, Kyra. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Your family - your <i>real</i> family - is celebrating tonight in your honor.

Id: [0x0022D720]
We're rebels with nothing left to rebel against. That's not much to start a family on... but it's more than I ever had. You're right.

Id: [0x0022D722]
They don't need me. You made sure none of them would ever trust me again.

Id: [0x0022D725]
Tell me. I would like to make things right between us.

Id: [0x0022D729]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0022D72C]
What's with all the whispering?

Id: [0x0022D72D]
[&shush]Shh![/&shush] If the soldiers hear us, they'll kill me. You're the misthios working for Kyra and the rebels, yes?

Id: [0x0022D731]
Who I work for is none of your business, stranger.

Id: [0x0022D732]
Secrets are being kept from you, <i>misthios</i>. Maybe you don't know who you <i>really</i> work for.

Id: [0x0022D738]
[&custom]Psst.[/&custom] Misthios! [beat]You, with the eagle. Over here.

Id: [0x0022D746]
Nothing. All of this was for nothing. You made sure of that... and now nothing will bring her back.

Id: [0x0022D74A]
I am.

Id: [0x0022D74B]
Yes, you are. Many whispers of your deeds, <i>misthios.</i> Many whispers. Many secrets, too... about the rebel girl.

Id: [0x0022D754]
You took everything from me. You took Podarkes. You took these islands. This glory was supposed to be mine.

Id: [0x0022D75D]
Who's Kyra?

Id: [0x0022D75E]
Yes! A smart question to ask yourself. But secrets are not secret forever, <i>misthios</i>. I can tell you...

Id: [0x0022D775]
The woman's dead. Now let Phaidon go free.

Id: [0x0022D776]
I'm disappointed. Did you really think I wouldn't have someone watching you? Now, like all who lie to me, you die.

Id: [0x0022D77C]
I think I've said enough.

Id: [0x0022D77D]
You too, Sokrates.

Id: [0x0022D78D]
That's the woman I'm supposed to kill. He described her well.

Id: [0x0022D796]
If the soldiers see me, they'll kill me. Apollo knows they already tried. There's a house near the market, been boarded up for ages. Sneaky sneak your way in. We'll talk after.

Id: [0x0022D7AF]
There must be a piece of armor with each missing stele.

Id: [0x0022D7B0]
But why?

Id: [0x0022D7B1]
This section here refers to a ritual.

Id: [0x0022D7B4]
Have I seen the temple?

Id: [0x0022D7B5]
Yes. Are you paying attention?

Id: [0x0022D7B7]
Should we see the Olympic Tree?

Id: [0x0022D7B8]
Were you sleeping? We've been there.

Id: [0x0022D7C0]
It's Olympia. What do you expect?

Id: [0x0022D7C3]
What about the Altar of Zeus?

Id: [0x0022D7C4]
We've already been.

Id: [0x0022D7CC]
Forget something? <i>Do</i> say it was to kiss me.

Id: [0x0022D7CE]
I knew you couldn't help but come back for more.

Id: [0x0022D7D0]
Can't make it?

Id: [0x0022D7D1]
To Kyra.

Id: [0x0022D7DB]
I don't have the patience to go chasing after children's stories.

Id: [0x0022D7DD]
She what? No. No! Gods curse these Delians. This island has been nothing but misery.

Id: [0x0022D7F4]
Place your bets, place your bets now! Who will win the javelin? It could be <i>you</i>!

Id: [0x0022D7FE]
Over here! Help me settle this dispute.

Id: [0x0022D806]
Strange. I should find the house, see what this beggar has to say.

Id: [0x0022D80B]
This woman was killed. Left in the open without dignity. [&hmm]An Athenian spear tip broke off in her ribs.

Id: [0x0022D810]
Wooden dolls - a mother and child. One engraved with the letter "M," and the other, "K."

Id: [0x0022D819]
I could take out his opponent... for the right price.

Id: [0x0022D81B]
Did you change your mind about helping?

Id: [0x0022D820]
A note was left behind. A warning from Podarkes. He was paying this woman to keep quiet. About what?

Id: [0x0022D822]
When I thought about it, I realized I didn't need to talk to the man to make the decision.

Id: [0x0022D82B]
About what you asked...

Id: [0x0022D831]
Go to the abandoned house by the water if you want to know who you're <i>really</i> working for.

Id: [0x0022D836]
Tempting, but no! Well, not this time.

Id: [0x0022D837]
What if I recited a poem? One of Pindar's... You know, to inspire him to greatness.

Id: [0x0022D839]
Look, um, Pithekos is good, but, uh, he's not really that kind of athlete.

Id: [0x0022D849]
I understand.

Id: [0x0022D852]
I'll find something to prove her innocence.

Id: [0x0022D855]
That is not enough proof.

Id: [0x0022D85A]
Well? Your "proof"?

Id: [0x0022D85D]
That's interesting.

Id: [0x0022D860]
That's ancient.

Id: [0x0022D862]
I have no idea. I'm presuming it means we need all of the steles in place before something happens.

Id: [0x0022D864]
This is proving to be more intriguing than I first thought.

Id: [0x0022D865]
This text is hard to make sense of. It's like some sort of warning. Be careful when you explore the Tomb of Orion.

Id: [0x0022D86F]
Doesn't look like Hermippos is here... I should take a look around.

Id: [0x0022D873]
There is much left to do, lamb.

Id: [0x0022D87B]
I can't continue the search at the moment.

Id: [0x0022D881]
All this for a stick? Get it yourself.

Id: [0x0022DD36]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0022DD38]
The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0022DD3A]
So be it.

Id: [0x0022DD40]
How do you know so much?

Id: [0x0022DD41]
I was there, <i>misthios</i>. I protected the little one. The Athenians were so busy trying to kill me, Kyra slipped right past their blades.

Id: [0x0022DD4A]
Relax. I'm glad you two had your fun. You taught him a thing or two.

Id: [0x0022DD4B]
You have?

Id: [0x0022DD4C]
Yes. We <i>have</i>.

Id: [0x0022DD4D]
Kyra needs to know Podarkes is her father. But I won't confront her until I have proof.

Id: [0x0022DD50]
The woman came to Podarkes's house one night, begged me to give him the doll Kyra made for him.

Id: [0x0022DD51]
If Podarkes had it, he might have kept it somewhere.

Id: [0x0022DD52]
Only the gods would know.

Id: [0x0022DD53]
I will find this doll.

Id: [0x0022DD5F]
Podarkes kept the doll Kyra made for him. She engraved it with the letter "P"... for <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x0022DD63]
I can match my bounty and then some, I'm sure.

Id: [0x0022DD65]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x0022DD67]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0022DD69]
No, you're not. Hardly worth betting, but your loss. Don't miss the competition. I'll see you on the sidelines tomorrow.

Id: [0x0022DD6A]
Huh, that's a lot of drachmae! The event's tomorrow. Make sure you're on time.

Id: [0x0022DD6B]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0022DD6D]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0022DD6F]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0022DD71]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0022DD75]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0022DD77]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0022DD8C]
Where were you? You missed everything. Look at this, what a magnificent throw!

Id: [0x0022DD94]
And I've already told them no. My place is here, on Delos, rebuilding my home with the woman I love.

Id: [0x0022DD95]
Closer.

Id: [0x0022DD96]
He told me his place is here, on our islands, rebuilding our home, and our love.

Id: [0x0022DD98]
But I'm staying here. Since you showed us Kyra's past, it's made us closer.

Id: [0x0022DD9A]
You earned this celebration, and all the prosperity the gods will bring.

Id: [0x0022DD9B]
The gods gave me more than enough. Any prosperity is for the people of the islands, not us. Thank you, Kassandra. We owe you our lives.

Id: [0x0022DD9F]
You owe me... both of you.

Id: [0x0022DDA0]
We will live forever in your debt. What we rebuild, we rebuild in your honor. Thank you, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022DDA2]
Kassandra! You know Iola?

Id: [0x0022DDE7]
She's... we're friends. But she told me she was leaving the islands.

Id: [0x0022DDE8]
How do you know each other? She said she was leaving the islands.

Id: [0x0022DDE9]
She was smuggling animals for profit... and <i>said</i> she was leaving the islands.

Id: [0x0022DDEA]
- And I went to pray. That's when I saw her with my good left eye -

Id: [0x0022DDEB]
- And I saw your pretty face with my good right eye.

Id: [0x0022DDEF]
Well, I went to the fountain by the sanctuary to get my arm cleaned up -

Id: [0x0022DDF6]
You were involved in this...

Id: [0x0022DDF9]
My name was Otonia. I was a servant for Podarkes.

Id: [0x0022DDFB]
Night after night, Kyra's <i>mater</i> came to the house - little one wanted to meet her <i>pater.</i> Podarkes made me send her away. But she kept coming. So Podarkes sent me to her house with a note.

Id: [0x0022DDFC]
The warning.

Id: [0x0022DDFE]
She didn't listen. Podarkes sent me back to her house, this time with Athenian soldiers.

Id: [0x0022DDFF]
Now you know who you're working for. The question is, <i>misthios</i>, what will you do?

Id: [0x0022DE01]
Like two stars aligning. Cute.

Id: [0x0022DE02]
The stink of roasting sacrifices, the sweaty bodies of pilgrims coming to pray... [beat]It was perfect.

Id: [0x0022DE03]
[&scoff]Spare me, you two.

Id: [0x0022DE04]
Come on, Kassandra! It was perfect - a beautiful woman, the stink of sacrifices roasting, sweaty pilgrims praying...

Id: [0x0022DE05]
Love hits you hardest when you don't see it coming.

Id: [0x0022DE09]
If Podarkes hid that doll somewhere in his house, I'm going to find it.

Id: [0x0022DE0E]
Where's Kyra?

Id: [0x0022DE10]
Miss me already, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0022DE12]
Kyra, there's something I need to tell you.

Id: [0x0022DE14]
That look on your face. So serious. Sit, relax, drink some wine.

Id: [0x0022DE1A]
It sounds like you're part of the family now. [beat]You've lost your crew and your ship... Why not join us on the Adrestia? We could use someone like you.

Id: [0x0022DE1B]
You could use <i>me</i>? Well... A life of freedom... Water at our feet, wind at our backs -

Id: [0x0022DE1F]
What do you think, Barney?

Id: [0x0022DE20]
I say welcome aboard!

Id: [0x0022DE23]
Then it's settled. We set off soon. Be on deck when we do.

Id: [0x0022DE28]
Still can't believe you killed that bear.

Id: [0x0022DE29]
What I'm about to say is for you alone.

Id: [0x0022DE2E]
Now that you have me all alone, what is it you want to tell me?

Id: [0x0022DE30]
There's no other way to say this... Podarkes is your father.

Id: [0x0022DE34]
What sort of joke is this?

Id: [0x0022DE35]
This isn't a joke.

Id: [0x0022DE36]
I will kill you where you stand.

Id: [0x0022DE44]
How I found it isn't important. What's important is that you know.

Id: [0x0022DE56]
Let them keep celebrating. I'll come back when I'm ready.

Id: [0x0022DE5C]
Time to let everyone know we're setting off?

Id: [0x0022DE5E]
I found your old house. I know about your <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x0022DE5F]
I can still hear her screams. A storm of blue armor and red blades tore through our home. <LF>

Id: [0x0022DE60]
It was best you didn't.

Id: [0x0022DE62]
Let's say goodbye.

Id: [0x0022DE63]
I didn't come to drink wine. I came to tell you and your men - [beat]Podarkes is your father.

Id: [0x0022DE68]
What?

Id: [0x0022DE69]
Her father?!

Id: [0x0022DE6A]
That's a lie!

Id: [0x0022DE6B]
This had better be some joke, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x0022DE6D]
Impossible.

Id: [0x0022DE70]
Is it true?

Id: [0x0022DE71]
The daughter of Podarkes?!

Id: [0x0022DE72]
We trusted you!

Id: [0x0022DE81]
It's good you told me in private. The men don't need to know this, not yet. But please, leave me for a while. I... need to be alone.

Id: [0x0022DE87]
<i>Chairete</i>! Settle down, settle down. Kassandra has something she'd like to say.

Id: [0x0022DE94]
Delians! Today, you have your freedom!

Id: [0x0022DE99]
So celebrate! Let Dionysos fill your cup, and the muses sing your songs.

Id: [0x0022DE9C]
Delians! We have won!

Id: [0x0022DE9E]
But now the real work begins. You must build a new home. A fair home. One where cruel people like Podarkes can never rise to power.

Id: [0x0022DEA3]
Delians! The Athenians have fallen... for now.

Id: [0x0022DEA5]
But they are still among you. Justice is yours to bring. Find the scum who fought for Podarkes, and make them suffer. They must pay for what they've done!

Id: [0x0022DEA9]
And now, a toast. To Kassandra! To victory!

Id: [0x0022DEC6]
A group called The Dagger are strangling Euboea with their greed. They work from the shadows, controlling the nation with bribery and blackmail. They're the reason I need the taxation records from that warehouse. I'm following a parchment trail which I believe will lead me to the person behind it all.

Id: [0x0022DEC8]
This world is a haven for liars. Trust no one.

Id: [0x0022DEC9]
Not all mercenaries are cutthroats. I can be trusted.

Id: [0x0022DECD]
What a speech! Though, I think some of the rebels like fighting more than rebuilding.

Id: [0x0022DED0]
He's been poisoned!

Id: [0x0022DED6]
I'm joking, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022DED7]
Probably.

Id: [0x0022DEDB]
The husband's carts. Looks like he tried to escape an armed patrol. Didn't end well.

Id: [0x0022DEE1]
The second horn. That means a quarter of the combatants are dead.

Id: [0x0022DEE3]
Another horn. Half the fighters are already dead.

Id: [0x0022DEE9]
Another horn. Almost finished.

Id: [0x0022DF04]
I'm nearly finished. I should return to Drakios.

Id: [0x0022DF0F]
Is there a final challenger?

Id: [0x0022DF10]
Indeed there is! Patience, Kassandra, patience.

Id: [0x0022DF11]
Tell me, Drakios! Is it Roxana? Is she alive?

Id: [0x0022DF12]
Come! We will finish this in the shadow of the volcano in the east.

Id: [0x0022DF1B]
I wouldn't think of it!

Id: [0x0022DF23]
This wheat might've fallen off one of the husband's carts. Maybe he's nearby...

Id: [0x0022DF26]
If you want an axe that looks like it was the Minotaur's, I have what you need.

Id: [0x0022DF27]
Yes! YES! With that in my hands, everyone in the village would believe I killed the beast!

Id: [0x0022DF35]
I'm back, and I have everything you need to successfully lie to your people.

Id: [0x0022DF38]
Oh, sorry <i>misthios - </i>without both the axe and the armor, there's no way my village will believe I killed the Minotaur. Do you have more questions?

Id: [0x0022DF41]
You mentioned the guard captain, Diokles. Who is he?

Id: [0x0022DF42]
[&grunt]Not a man of the people, <i>misthios. </i>It's at his encouragement the guards put so much pressure on the merchants.

Id: [0x0022DF46]
If it isn't my champion. I guess you found someone else to train with.

Id: [0x0022DF47]
I'll just have to collect it from him instead.

Id: [0x0022DF48]
And you must be Diokles.

Id: [0x0022DF52]
I paid to enter.

Id: [0x0022DF53]
A bigger purse for me, then. It's just as well. I finished my training with one of those amateurs on Hydrea. He's dead now.

Id: [0x0022DF5A]
Yes, yes. The purse will go to the winner. But the Battle is still on until one of you is left slain.

Id: [0x0022DF5C]
I'm sorry, champion. You stand in the way of my destiny.

Id: [0x0022E16E]
With every stele fragment, we are closer to proving the gods intervened and imbued this warrior's armor with power. Ready to continue our search?

Id: [0x0022E1E0]
She's -

Id: [0x0022E30F]
The Oracle is hiding inside. I'll finally get some answers.

Id: [0x0022E311]
Being here among the ancients is inspiring. I'm anxious for the next stele fragment, hero.

Id: [0x0022E314]
I need the next stele fragment in order to decipher the writing.

Id: [0x0022E325]
The white bull. Am I too late?

Id: [0x0022E32B]
I'll take that key, thank you.

Id: [0x0022E33F]
The crystal thieves... Got you.

Id: [0x0022E385]
That old priest... hiding by the tree.

Id: [0x0022E3CE]
That must be Testikles.

Id: [0x0022E3E4]
There's the Altar of Apollo Maleatas.

Id: [0x0022E408]
There. Will be good to see <i>mater</i> and Brasidas again.

Id: [0x0022E415]
Knock, knock, Lagos. Here I come.

Id: [0x0022E422]
If a farmer steals a fruit today, but gives some of his crop to the poor tomorrow, who may decide if he is good? Hmm...

Id: [0x0022E427]
Make sure Sophanes doesn't know I was part of this.

Id: [0x0022E42C]
These markings are fascinating.

Id: [0x0022E42D]
It's unlike anything else I've ever seen.

Id: [0x0022E42E]
I wonder what this one represents. Hmm...

Id: [0x0022E433]
Hmm. Empty. Someone else had the same idea.

Id: [0x0022E436]
The gods will abandon us!

Id: [0x0022E437]
We are doomed! The gods will curse our names!

Id: [0x0022E438]
It can't be that bad.

Id: [0x0022E43D]
We'll need to deal with Hermippos at some point.

Id: [0x0022E442]
Don't worry, Aristophanes could never write me well enough for a play.

Id: [0x0022E447]
Don't worry, I'm sure we'll get another chance to speak soon.

Id: [0x0022E466]
The krypteia.

Id: [0x0022E474]
This is no wolf. This is a hungry beast sent by the gods.

Id: [0x0022E478]
Have you had a change of heart? Will you get me a <i>special</i> javelin? It must be light as a feather!

Id: [0x0022E4C9]
There's the camp.

Id: [0x0022E4CD]
His shop is close to the docks in Sami. Shouldn't be too hard to find.

Id: [0x0022E4D1]
There you are, Duris. Time to get my drachmae.

Id: [0x0022E4E9]
There's the cave. Now to find the apprentice - or what's left of him.

Id: [0x0022E4F8]
That's the thief.

Id: [0x0022E504]
You look ready to go.

Id: [0x0022E505]
Podarkes is gone, Thaletas and Kyra have their islands, and I have other targets to hit.

Id: [0x0022E506]
You are victorious - not that I ever doubted it. Why not say goodbye... A rousing speech to get the blood flowing?

Id: [0x0022E50E]
Podarkes is gone, Kyra's with her rebels, and I have other targets to hit.

Id: [0x0022E50F]
Then we sail! But first... I may have told Kyra you'd give a speech to the rebels before saying goodbye.

Id: [0x0022E510]
Podarkes is gone, Thaletas is set to become general, and I have other targets to hit.

Id: [0x0022E511]
Then it's time to say goodbye. What about a speech to those you've inspired?

Id: [0x0022E515]
Their captain, Diokles, is more a bandit than a guard. [sigh]This unrest is bad for business. I need you to quiet some of the outbursts around Kydonia.

Id: [0x0022E521]
There's Astra.

Id: [0x0022E533]
There's Euneas. He's in bad shape.

Id: [0x0022E53F]
A cave entrance. They're in there.

Id: [0x0022E55A]
Aristaios. [beat]Found you.

Id: [0x0022E55E]
There stalks the mighty hunter.

Id: [0x0022E562]
Deianeira is somewhere in this half of the region. Now to find the caves.

Id: [0x0022E566]
The Cave of the Oracles must be close.

Id: [0x0022E56A]
The Cave of the Oracles. Deianeira can't be far.

Id: [0x0022E56E]
Someone in this city must know where Drakon is.

Id: [0x0022E572]
The Sacrifice of Iphigenia. I need to head west.

Id: [0x0022E576]
There's the training ground. Drakon won't be far away.

Id: [0x0022E588]
The entrance to the temple. The Oracle's inside.

Id: [0x0022E58A]
I might have a job for you, if you're as good a fighter as I've heard.

Id: [0x0022E58D]
You've heard of me?

Id: [0x0022E58E]
Don't let it go to your head. I hear about everything that happens in this city, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022E58F]
With flattery like that, how could I possibly turn you down?

Id: [0x0022E590]
I'm not trying to flatter you. I'm trying to hire you. I need some Spartan military targets... removed.

Id: [0x0022E592]
I think you may have the wrong idea about me, General...?

Id: [0x0022E593]
I'll help you, if I can. Depending on what it is you need, General...

Id: [0x0022E5A2]
The house. The attacker must be here somewhere.

Id: [0x0022E5AE]
My spies tell me the Spartans are mobilizing. What I want you to do is hamstring them. Get into their forts and remove the commanders in charge.

Id: [0x0022E5BB]
Those don't seem like standard Athenian tactics.

Id: [0x0022E5BE]
All right. I'll take the job.

Id: [0x0022E621]
Only elite Spartan commanders carry these seals, those in charge of entire forts. They'd all die before parting with them. So bring me the seals as proof that they're dead.

Id: [0x0022E624]
Where can I find them?

Id: [0x0022E625]
The Spartans have been making inroads into Athenian territory, taking over forts that once belonged to us. Make them pay for every inch.

Id: [0x0022E627]
You've told me enough. I'll get your seals for you, General.

Id: [0x0022E636]
That must be Kallias.

Id: [0x0022E63D]
Oh, it's terrible!

Id: [0x0022E63E]
Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x0022E641]
Stop that noise!

Id: [0x0022E642]
Ahh!

Id: [0x0022E643]
Better. Now, quietly, tell me what happened here.

Id: [0x0022E665]
The lighthouse was plundered by bandits, the Terrors of Kyknos! I fear they've gone to the Mycenaean Tomb of Ajax.

Id: [0x0022E668]
Of course I do. It was easy.

Id: [0x0022E673]
Do you have my seals yet?

Id: [0x0022E687]
Podarkes is dead, but this is no time to celebrate. The Spartans and the rebels have both suffered.

Id: [0x0022E688]
Ours is a time of loss, it's true. Would you rather we just set sail?

Id: [0x0022E68C]
No, but I'll come back when I am.

Id: [0x0022E691]
Should we ship off?

Id: [0x0022E692]
I've done more than enough here.

Id: [0x0022E693]
Of course, of course. Who wouldn't? I'll round up the crew. See you back at the ship?

Id: [0x0022E695]
I think they liked it.

Id: [0x0022E697]
I'll round up the crew. See you back at the ship.

Id: [0x0022E69B]
I'll check Thaletas. You stop that man!

Id: [0x0022E6AD]
These bodies... Such a waste of life for sport.

Id: [0x0022E6AF]
I'm here to check the warehouse's taxation records, but I'm being refused entry.

Id: [0x0022E6B0]
I can only imagine the might of all these warriors aligned against the Cult. [beat]Instead, we came to Melos to slaughter each other over a sack of drachmae.

Id: [0x0022E6B6]
Take my advice. [beat]Stay away from that warehouse.

Id: [0x0022E6BA]
I haven't seen Roxana among the dead.

Id: [0x0022E7FB]
That's the last of them around here.

Id: [0x0022E92F]
All these warriors are dead. I should move on.

Id: [0x0022E934]
This area is clear.

Id: [0x0022E939]
I need to keep moving.

Id: [0x0022E93E]
That remains to be seen.

Id: [0x0022E93F]
But I <i>do</i> trust - I trust in what Euboea was, and what she can be again.

Id: [0x0022E9AC]
The other contestants must be somewhere else.

Id: [0x0022EB45]
What's causing the corruption?

Id: [0x0022EF56]
This one's all alone.

Id: [0x0022EF57]
Get her!

Id: [0x0022EF5E]
I thought this was every fighter for herself. These people are clearly working together.

Id: [0x0022F03A]
My name's Arsenios. If you want to know how to defeat the Minotaur, and become the Greek world's most famous warrior, then <i>this</i> is the tour for you!

Id: [0x0022F121]
You know, you do look like someone I've met before, another fierce warrior. Family resemblance, perhaps?

Id: [0x0022F122]
You mean Deimos? [beat]Then this Battle is backed by the Cult.

Id: [0x0022F123]
Of course I can't talk about that. Not with any old challenger. But become the champion of the Battle of One Hundred Hands, and I'll tell you all I know.

Id: [0x0022F125]
And I need three fewer daughters, but we don't often get what we want, old friend.

Id: [0x0022F128]
How did you become the person who organizes the Battle?

Id: [0x0022F129]
I was a up-and-coming merchant in these parts... Down on my luck, it turned out. Owed a few favors, then some powerful people called in those favors. Turned out to be good for me. Blood sports are big business on Melos.

Id: [0x0022F12B]
Your final challenger approaches.

Id: [0x0022F130]
Warriors from all over the Aegean come to Pephka to face the Mighty Minotaur, hoping to claim his head as the ultimate prize. So far, well, [&ahem][clears throat sheepishly]he's killed all of them.

Id: [0x0022F133]
<i>What?!</i>

Id: [0x0022F134]
Do you have any idea how hard it is to scrape the hooves of a sleeping Minotaur? And they love eating kids! Especially precocious ones! So no. No deal.

Id: [0x0022F147]
Bloody typical, we're left here. I mean where's the justice in that?

Id: [0x0022F150]
None. But that's 'cause we're pirates, ain't we?

Id: [0x0022F151]
You know what I mean. Captain's swanning off, partying like Dionysos, while we're stuck <i>guarding</i> this lump of dirt!

Id: [0x0022F153]
Not so bad. Got a blanket, and all the fish we can catch.

Id: [0x0022F154]
I wanted to do something, be more than just another <i>malákas</i> goat herder. So how did I get here?

Id: [0x0022F155]
Captain recruited you.

Id: [0x0022F156]
That was rhetorical. Gods, it's like living with Pythagoras.

Id: [0x0022F157]
Hey, ain't he dead?

Id: [0x0022F158]
[sigh]Exactly. Oh, what I'd give for more intelligent conversation, or even just a conversation.

Id: [0x0022F159]
Never met a rhetorical - they allies of the Persians?

Id: [0x0022F162]
Well, if you're going to win these islands for her, you'll need more soldiers.

Id: [0x0022F16A]
They'd never get here alive. The Athenian navy is too powerful, and our ship is at the bottom of the sea.

Id: [0x0022F16B]
Mine isn't.

Id: [0x0022F16C]
You'd confront them in open waters? Not sure if you're brave or just mad.

Id: [0x0022F19F]
There'll be plenty more people we can recruit in the future. The gods will provide us with the opportunities we need, of that I'm sure.

Id: [0x0022F1B3]
Hmm, the crew's still shorthanded. Maybe I'll <i>recruit</i> another one of these pirates.

Id: [0x0022F1C9]
They won't expect anyone to come after them. I'll sneak up and surprise them.

Id: [0x0022F1CB]
Ajax is not the only one blessed by the gods. I'll crush these so-called terrors!

Id: [0x0022F1D1]
I thought we could use more than just one new recruit.

Id: [0x0022F1D2]
Ha! You're right there, and we'll need more in the future, too. But don't worry, there'll be plenty of opportunities to pick the best of the best from all over the Greek world.

Id: [0x0022F1D3]
I have a feeling we'll be needing them.

Id: [0x0022F1F1]
The Athenians will retaliate for what I've done, unless we hit them first.

Id: [0x0022F2D0]
Then we need to strike first.

Id: [0x0022F2D1]
Exactly.

Id: [0x0022F2D6]
There's more pirates in these waters than sardines these days.

Id: [0x0022F2DC]
The war has changed the face of the Greek world. If it's not Spartans or Athenians, it's bandits and pirates. Gods protect us all from mankind.

Id: [0x0022F2E2]
From what I've heard, Megaris is home to the fiercest fighting so far. The Spartans are preparing for a final push to rid the region of Athenians.

Id: [0x0022F2EB]
That should be the last of them, <i>misthios</i>. You're quite the warrior.

Id: [0x0022F2F1]
<i>Maláka</i>!

Id: [0x0022F2F7]
Will he be enough?

Id: [0x0022F2F8]
Don't worry, there'll be plenty of opportunities to recruit more people as we go.

Id: [0x0022F362]
Even after all Sophanes did, he gets another chance...

Id: [0x0022F364]
And the third?

Id: [0x0022F365]
Him, we don't know.

Id: [0x0022F367]
I'll be careful.

Id: [0x0022F36C]
There may be some truth in this lore.

Id: [0x0022F36D]
<i>Ugh</i>! Is that blood on it?

Id: [0x0022F36F]
This one needs a good cleaning... Let's hope the remaining ones are fine.

Id: [0x0022F38D]
This must be Thespis's house.

Id: [0x0022F3D4]
Help! Somebody? [beat]Anybody? <i>Hello?</i>

Id: [0x0022F3F3]
Athenians give speeches. Spartans give orders.

Id: [0x0022F407]
There's a shipwreck, and there's the miltos.

Id: [0x0022F40D]
And miss your speech?[&scoff] Never.

Id: [0x0022F40E]
Athenians give speeches. Spartans give orders.

Id: [0x0022F41A]
If there <i>is</i> a map, it's in there.

Id: [0x0022F42F]
Going to have to swim if I want to get to these ruins.

Id: [0x0022F445]
What tide sweeps you back to me, Kassandra? Are you up for finding my treasures now?

Id: [0x0022F459]
The messenger - he's being held in that prison camp.

Id: [0x0022F463]
Still looking for the golden eagle feather? What else can I tell you?

Id: [0x0022F46A]
Thank the gods. Those soldiers are blood hungry. They want me dead! They say I'm a deserter.

Id: [0x0022F470]
Kassandra, welcome to the newest of the Markos estates. I wasn't expecting company, but one must always be prepared! Wine?

Id: [0x0022F471]
Markos, I can't believe you're here.

Id: [0x0022F472]
Believe it, my friend! I'm not a man of one city, but of <i>all </i>cities. Who am I to deny the rest of the Greek world what I have to offer?

Id: [0x0022F474]
Been here long?

Id: [0x0022F475]
You made it a long way from home.

Id: [0x0022F478]
Your "Mama"? [beat]You told me your mother was dead.

Id: [0x0022F479]
Right, this is my <i>adopted</i> Mama. We've become so close, she wouldn't have it any other way!

Id: [0x0022F47A]
Markos?

Id: [0x0022F47B]
Kassandra? <i>Chaire</i>!

Id: [0x0022F47C]
How...

Id: [0x0022F47D]
Kept myself busy, haven't I? No time to explain here. Get me out!

Id: [0x0022F482]
You're as nimble as ever! Now, carry me to my house on the other side of the mountain.

Id: [0x0022F484]
I-I'm so weak. I'm so frail...

Id: [0x0022F494]
I've been sent to kill you, and that's exactly what I'm going to do, <i>maláka</i>.

Id: [0x0022F495]
Please! I beg the gods to forgive you for this!

Id: [0x0022F49C]
You're quiet tonight, Barnabas.

Id: [0x0022F49D]
Sorry. [beat]Years ago, on a bright night like this one, my old friend Garos and I were sailing to Samos, when we heard our names being sung out in the middle of the darkness. The song was so sweet we forgot how to sail.

Id: [0x0022F49E]
Don't tell me - you saw the Sirens.

Id: [0x0022F49F]
I covered my ears to drown out their chants... But when I went to warn Garos, he was gone. [beat]I never saw him again.

Id: [0x0022F4A0]
I’m sorry.

Id: [0x0022F4A1]
When the sea calls, you never know where it will lead you. Garos might be king of some faraway land by now. [beat]You never know.

Id: [0x0022F4AE]
Time to meet Commander Rhexenor.

Id: [0x0022F4B3]
You even know your way around the seas at night. Impressive.

Id: [0x0022F4B4]
It’s an art, friend! My father used to say when Nyx blinds you, seek Hekate!

Id: [0x0022F4B5]
Your father was a man of the sea as well?

Id: [0x0022F4B6]
No, he was a potter. But he was a man who always saw light in the darkest of places.

Id: [0x0022F4B7]
Then you take after your father.

Id: [0x0022F4B8]
We all do, whether we like it or not.     

Id: [0x0022F4BC]
The commander has guards. But they're not there to protect him...

Id: [0x0022F4C0]
The commander's in here. I should be careful.

Id: [0x0022F4C4]
This commander has a small army with him. He must have known I was coming.

Id: [0x0022F4C8]
The commander is hiding.[&breath] This could be a trap.

Id: [0x0022F4CF]
Look, Kassandra. Isn’t it a beautiful night?

Id: [0x0022F4D0]
On the hotter nights on Kephallonia, I used to lay down on the roof and fall asleep under the stars.

Id: [0x0022F4D1]
I always thought of them as something the gods created to guide us. Clues to find our way. You?

Id: [0x0022F4D2]
It... doesn't matter.

Id: [0x0022F4D3]
Ah, come on! Tell me.     

Id: [0x0022F4D4]
Well... To me, they are hundreds of small suns very far away.

Id: [0x0022F4D5]
[laughs]Now that's a story!

Id: [0x0022F4D6]
[laughs]I told you it didn't matter.

Id: [0x0022F4D7]
You may be surprised to know that many share your theory, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022F4D8]
I guess we'll never know.

Id: [0x0022F4DB]
Even the gods couldn't save you, soldier.

Id: [0x0022F4DF]
Thaletas sends his regards.

Id: [0x0022F4E3]
For Sparta.

Id: [0x0022F4E7]
One less Athenian on Delos.

Id: [0x0022F4EA]
What brings you to Kos, of all places?

Id: [0x0022F4EB]
I've learned a thing or two about soil. Turns out, Kephallonia wasn't the best place for grapes. Plus, the locals here <i>love</i> wine.

Id: [0x0022F4EC]
Long enough to establish myself as the foremost wine-seller in Kos! [beat]Well, the one wine-seller in Kos. The Koans will come around eventually.

Id: [0x0022F4F0]
Here. One golden eagle feather, per request.

Id: [0x0022F4FD]
Help!

Id: [0x0022F50E]
By <i>Zeus</i>... I would have been a goner there if it wasn't for you.

Id: [0x0022F515]
How can I turn down the promise of precious things?

Id: [0x0022F518]
I don't have the time, Eppie. You're on your own.

Id: [0x0022F51D]
Oh! You've changed your mind. Will you come with me to the Mycenaean burial site?

Id: [0x0022F597]
Since Kos is her home, Kos is my home too. Say hello, Mama!

Id: [0x0022F5A0]
Leave me!

Id: [0x0022F5A8]
Come on, Markos. The truth.

Id: [0x0022F5AB]
Well, Mama is the owner of the vineyard. When her husband met his untimely death, it was going to be auctioned off. Something had to be done!

Id: [0x0022F5AF]
Did you find what you were looking for in Athens?

Id: [0x0022F5B0]
A few clues - but this [beat]won't be easy.

Id: [0x0022F5B1]
Well it’s a good start! All we can do now is trust the path the gods have laid out for us.

Id: [0x0022F5B2]
I’m not the only one looking for my mother. The cult that wanted Nikolaos dead? They're also on my trail.

Id: [0x0022F5B3]
Oh, they're no match for you.

Id: [0x0022F5B4]
You got that right.

Id: [0x0022F5C9]
So you stepped in to help. How generous.

Id: [0x0022F5CA]
It's ridiculous a wonderful lady such as Mama can't inherit her own property. Now, we run the vineyard together. Isn't that right, Mama?

Id: [0x0022F5E4]
She'd put up a fuss if she disagreed. It's her land, but she shares it with her precious son - me!

Id: [0x0022F5EF]
It's a nice place you've commandeered, Markos.

Id: [0x0022F5F0]
Don't think I've forgotten that "Markos always has a plan." Sounds like one of your schemes.

Id: [0x0022F5F1]
Kassandra, that was the old Markos. These days, I live a peaceful life.

Id: [0x0022F5F2]
You were tied up in a fort. That's peaceful?

Id: [0x0022F5FB]
Eh - about that. [beat]I have a bit of a problem on my hands.

Id: [0x0022F5FC]
The <i>Cerberus?</i> First the Cyclops, and now this? Don't tell me it's a three-headed dog.

Id: [0x0022F5FD]
Don't be ridiculous! This is nothing like the Cyclops. This time, I wish to make a peace offering - with nothing less than my finest wine.

Id: [0x0022F5FE]
"Finest?" Palatable, maybe.

Id: [0x0022F607]
Yes. I have the seals for you.

Id: [0x0022F608]
[&breath]Much has happened since we first met on the beach.

Id: [0x0022F609]
You were surrounded by Athenians. Drenched in blood.

Id: [0x0022F60A]
You fought by my side.

Id: [0x0022F618]
You've discovered something, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022F619]
The Cult, Herodotos - they're worse than we thought.

Id: [0x0022F61A]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0022F61B]
In Argolis, I found this woman, a priestess, who stole my brother Alexios away from my mother a long time ago.

Id: [0x0022F61C]
Oh!

Id: [0x0022F61D]
That same priestess was getting ready to take down the physician Hippokrates for his radical views.

Id: [0x0022F61E]
She can't -

Id: [0x0022F61F]
And she won't, but there are so many others out there like her. They're everywhere.

Id: [0x0022F620]
Have you changed your mind? Decided to do the right thing?

Id: [0x0022F623]
You were irresistible.

Id: [0x0022F625]
I couldn't let you have all the fun.

Id: [0x0022F63C]
When I first laid eyes on Kyra, I knew I never wanted to leave these islands.

Id: [0x0022F63D]
And now?

Id: [0x0022F63E]
I don't know.

Id: [0x0022F63F]
Thaletas, look at me.

Id: [0x0022F641]
I know what I want.

Id: [0x0022F642]
Not here. Come.

Id: [0x0022F666]
I don't have any drachmae, but I am hungry.

Id: [0x0022F667]
The gods don't like beggars, stranger. Get out of here.

Id: [0x0022F66D]
You think I don't know your voice?!

Id: [0x0022F66F]
Please help me! Prove that I had the right to see my son in the Games.

Id: [0x0022F681]
My family...

Id: [0x0022F684]
Yes, of-of course, my love!

Id: [0x0022F685]
Oh, and - [&hmm]this is for you.

Id: [0x0022F687]
A coward doesn't deserve to be the Minotaur. You do.

Id: [0x0022F68A]
The people who took you... If there's anything you overheard, anything that could help me stop them -

Id: [0x0022F68B]
While I pretended to sleep, their leader spoke of a meeting place in Kydonia. I wrote down all the Masked Men's whisperings. Hopefully something in here will be useful to you.

Id: [0x0022F692]
Better collect my drachmae from the husband's stash in the Katarraktes Cave.

Id: [0x0022F69B]
Keep fighting, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0022F69E]
We don't have to kill each other.

Id: [0x0022F69F]
The stakes were clear from the beginning, Kassandra. Don't do this. I'm so close -

Id: [0x0022F6A0]
Enough! The Battle must end now!

Id: [0x0022F6A1]
No. Roxana, we decide how this ends. Not him.

Id: [0x0022F6A4]
How do you know The Dagger's watching the shipwreck[2105455]?

Id: [0x0022F6A5]
I see them row out to it. Men dive down and never come up. Those who do are half-drowned and terrified. They're forced to go back down again and again until they're dead.

Id: [0x0022F6C9]
No! Get away!

Id: [0x0022F6D5]
Oh no! My research!

Id: [0x0022F6DD]
These must be the ruins[2347407] Thaletas mentioned. The beach is east of here.

Id: [0x0022F6E0]
I don't have the drachmae...

Id: [0x0022F6E1]
And I don't have the time. Paying customers only.

Id: [0x0022F6E7]
I should start training soon for the Delian games.

Id: [0x0022F6EC]
Big sale on javelins when the Games are over. Tell your friends!

Id: [0x0022F6F1]
Doubting yourself, Spartan?

Id: [0x0022F6F3]
I must be getting too old for gambling. My heart could barely take the stress.

Id: [0x0022F6F7]
Ha! I was doubting your tracking skills.

Id: [0x0022F6FF]
That's the guy Alkibiades called handsome? Can't say I agree with him...

Id: [0x0022F704]
I'm surprised you left flowers. [beat]Was nice following something other than blood for a change.

Id: [0x0022F706]
I... I'm not very good with these kinds of things. There's flowers all over Delos. I saw them, and thought...

Id: [0x0022F708]
Thought what?

Id: [0x0022F70C]
So, those flowers. I'll be honest, you didn't strike me as the type.

Id: [0x0022F723]
I'm glad you like it. Because this is where I'm going to see what you're really made of.

Id: [0x0022F724]
You've won my heart, Kassandra. But to claim it, I need to see what you're really made of.

Id: [0x0022F72B]
Huh?

Id: [0x0022F732]
You claimed to be Spartan when we first met. I want to see if you fight like one.

Id: [0x0022F733]
You've seen me fight.

Id: [0x0022F734]
Against Athenians, yes.

Id: [0x0022F735]
Well?

Id: [0x0022F737]
When we first met, you denied being Spartan.

Id: [0x0022F738]
And?

Id: [0x0022F73A]
The only way to truly know someone is through combat - hand to hand, flesh to flesh, bone to bone.

Id: [0x0022F73C]
Fine. Just don't get angry when I break that pretty face of yours.

Id: [0x0022F73E]
You're my business partner - until the end! Who else would I dream of asking to join in on this deal?

Id: [0x0022F762]
Tracking skills? You didn't notice my eagle?

Id: [0x0022F763]
Does he watch your every move?

Id: [0x0022F765]
I can send Ikaros away. Unless of course, you like being watched.

Id: [0x0022F77E]
Everybody loves wine.

Id: [0x0022F77F]
Besides, how profitable could I have been in a town of thieves and mercenaries? Not very.

Id: [0x0022F786]
Stele and armor. Why were they removed from the tomb in the first place?

Id: [0x0022F78C]
[&ahem]The gods work fast! I wished someone as beautiful as me were here, and you arrived!

Id: [0x0022F794]
Barnabas, you'll never believe what happened in Messara. [beat]Actually, you probably will. 

Id: [0x0022F795]
You have my full attention!

Id: [0x0022F796]
I found the legendary labyrinth near Knossos. 

Id: [0x0022F797]
Did you go inside?!

Id: [0x0022F798]
I defeated the Minotaur.

Id: [0x0022F799]
That's quite a story.

Id: [0x0022F79A]
Story? These are the gods we're talking about, Herodotos! [beat]Tell me, what did the beast look like? Was he as ruthless as the legends say?

Id: [0x0022F79B]
He is. And smelled pretty bad too...

Id: [0x0022F79C]
How could anyone possibly believe -

Id: [0x0022F79D]
I ripped out one of his horns.

Id: [0x0022F79E]
By the gods!

Id: [0x0022F79F]
You're a hero of legend!

Id: [0x0022F7A0]
And this artifact seems to have special abilities... The Cult cannot get their hands on <i>this</i>.

Id: [0x0022F7A4]
Your heartbeat is as loud as the sea itself!

Id: [0x0022F7A5]
We’re approaching Naxos.

Id: [0x0022F7A6]
Are you excited?

Id: [0x0022F7A7]
Nervous. What will I say to her?

Id: [0x0022F7A8]
Kassandra, you’ve travelled half the Greek world to find her. You don’t have to say anything. Just being there will be enough.

Id: [0x0022F7A9]
But what if she [beat]is disappointed in me?

Id: [0x0022F7AA]
Listen. Any mother would want a child as brave and as loyal as you. If I were your mother, I would be the nervous one.

Id: [0x0022F7AB]
You think so?

Id: [0x0022F7AC]
I know so. Now, go on and find her. You waited long enough for this!

Id: [0x0022F7AE]
[&laughs]If I didn't know you so well, I'd think you were serious! I'm always laughing these days.

Id: [0x0022F7AF]
You weren't laughing much when you were tied up in that fort.

Id: [0x0022F7B6]
Did you know the howls of dying wolves can frighten even the hardest veteran?

Id: [0x0022F7B7]
Why are you telling me this?

Id: [0x0022F7B8]
I need to raid a Spartan camp near here. If someone were to hunt wolves at that time, the noise would cover my presence.

Id: [0x0022F7B9]
And scare the soldiers. Clever.

Id: [0x0022F7BA]
Thanks.

Id: [0x0022F7BF]
And? What happened on Naxos? Did you find your mother?

Id: [0x0022F7C0]
I found her, Barnabas.   

Id: [0x0022F7C1]
Wonderful! Maybe now we can kick back and relax -

Id: [0x0022F7C2]
But [beat]I have bad news. We know the Cult of Kosmos poisons everything they touch, but now even Sparta's in their grasp. They’ll have everyone fighting like dogs until the world is back to the dark ages. [beat]I have to stop them.

Id: [0x0022F7C3]
Then that's where we'll sail to next!

Id: [0x0022F7C4]
I'm glad you're with me.

Id: [0x0022F7C8]
So! What next?

Id: [0x0022F7C9]
We could go hunting.

Id: [0x0022F7CA]
Do I look like the type that can defend myself?

Id: [0x0022F7CC]
We won't hunt bears, Herodotos. We'll hunt liars, traitors... You know, the usual big game.

Id: [0x0022F7CE]
Ah! The worst kind of beasts. Where should we head?

Id: [0x0022F7D3]
Then set sail. We have a Cult to kill.

Id: [0x0022F7DD]
[&ah]Some deal.

Id: [0x0022F7DF]
Kassandra, you're like family to me. And since<i> I'm</i> family to <i>you</i>, I'm sure you wouldn't mind helping.

Id: [0x0022F7E0]
[&breath]You're sure, are you?

Id: [0x0022F7E2]
I promise I can afford to pay you this time. Just take my wine to the Cerberus - simple!

Id: [0x0022F7EB]
What? Do you still have it?

Id: [0x0022F7ED]
Amazing. I came across a golden feather not long ago.

Id: [0x0022F7EE]
Fine. For old time's sake.

Id: [0x0022F7EF]
I can always count on you! And the Cerberus can count on a nice wine pairing with dinner. Take it to his house.

Id: [0x0022F7F0]
The Cerberus better not bite me.

Id: [0x0022F7F3]
I'll think about it. Maybe later.

Id: [0x0022F7F4]
Of course! Just don't forget about your friend, Markos.

Id: [0x0022F808]
It seems we have a deserter problem.

Id: [0x0022F80E]
Conditions must be bad if so many soldiers are leaving their posts.

Id: [0x0022F80F]
Conditions are the same as always. And the pay is very good, in particular for special help.

Id: [0x0022F811]
I fail to see how this is my problem.

Id: [0x0022F812]
For enough pay, could it be your problem?

Id: [0x0022F816]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x0022F817]
I can't let those deserters live. But there's too many for me to take care of myself. I also suspect there's a Spartan spy among my ranks inciting them to leave.

Id: [0x0022F81A]
Why am I not surprised?

Id: [0x0022F81B]
But it's something I know you could help me with, my friend! I know your credentials.

Id: [0x0022F821]
Go on.

Id: [0x0022F822]
You know me... I borrow some drachmae, and before I know it, they're calling me the Con of Kos! All thanks to the Cerberus - whom I owe the most.

Id: [0x0022F823]
Your tale of woe will have to wait. I'll come back later.

Id: [0x0022F82D]
It's almost unfair for the both of us to be in one place. It will make everyone else feel bad.

Id: [0x0022F82E]
Don't worry about them. These poor fools have accepted their fate - the gods decided many should lack in beauty while you and I <i>bathe</i> in it.

Id: [0x0022F82F]
You're drunker than normal.

Id: [0x0022F830]
You'll have to forgive me. At this time of night, I like to get to the point when I have a pretty face staring back at me.

Id: [0x0022F831]
Another successful party, then.

Id: [0x0022F832]
The only kind I know. Although, I have a slight problem. There's an important politician here who really needs to get back home, but gods know I can't make the trip.

Id: [0x0022F834]
He can make the trip when he wakes up.

Id: [0x0022F835]
I'll make sure he gets home safe.

Id: [0x0022F836]
Yes, <i>safe</i>. Right. It should be an easy trip, although you may have to carry him at this point. [beat]Lucky man...

Id: [0x0022F838]
You could let him stay here.

Id: [0x0022F839]
I would, but it's never good to let a politician stay the night. It's a rule of mine.

Id: [0x0022F83A]
What has he done to be so special?

Id: [0x0022F83B]
Well he... Uh... It was something to do with people, I think? Gods, I don't know. You may as well ask what I ate ten days ago.

Id: [0x0022F841]
I'm surprised you <i>have</i> rules.

Id: [0x0022F842]
You know how they can be. Never want to stop talking. There's only so much I can take. But for you, [beat]I'd break all of my rules.

Id: [0x0022F843]
Don't. You and Kyra belong together. That hasn't changed.

Id: [0x0022F84A]
Kassandra! Now, let me tell you about my little problem.

Id: [0x0022F84E]
<i>Misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0022F850]
Don't tell my men about the flowers.

Id: [0x0022F852]
I won't.

Id: [0x0022F857]
I have the wine all ready for you, Kassandra. It just needs a delivery girl!

Id: [0x0022F85C]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0022F85F]
<i>Misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0022F860]
I could never forget you, Markos.

Id: [0x0022F863]
Be careful on the way to the Cerberus's house. I always cry over spilled wine.<LF>

Id: [0x0022F86E]
<i>Misthios</i>, please help me. I'm in such terrible pain.

Id: [0x0022F876]
Do you have news?

Id: [0x0022F883]
Have you decided to grant a dying man his wish?

Id: [0x0022F88C]
That I do remember.

Id: [0x0022F896]
You amaze me.

Id: [0x0022F897]
[&hmm]How so?

Id: [0x0022F898]
For the first time since I was a boy, I forgot about war.

Id: [0x0022F899]
Glad I could help.

Id: [0x0022F89A]
What about you? Are there things you'd like to forget?

Id: [0x0022F8A0]
[sigh]Fine.

Id: [0x0022F8A3]
My life is already over. I'm nothing but my suffering.

Id: [0x0022F8A4]
There may still be hope if I can learn more about what ails you.

Id: [0x0022F8AB]
The sooner we forget what happened here, the sooner we can focus on the rebellion, and I can set sail again.

Id: [0x0022F8AD]
I... I loved Kyra, but I chose you.

Id: [0x0022F8AF]
I’m a mercenary. You’re Spartan. Your love for Kyra is safe. I won’t tell if you don’t.

Id: [0x0022F8B0]
So, that’s it?

Id: [0x0022F8B2]
There is much of my past I wish I could forget.

Id: [0x0022F8B4]
I'd love to hear about it.

Id: [0x0022F8B5]
And I'd love to tell you. But we have a war to fight.

Id: [0x0022F8B6]
When this war is won, then. We'll drink and share our deep, dark secrets.

Id: [0x0022F8B8]
I'd like that.

Id: [0x0022F8BF]
Though as I recall, I had <i>your</i> back.

Id: [0x0022F8C0]
Polish your memories like you would your armor, and they'll make much better tales.

Id: [0x0022F8C2]
Not if my rivals have their way.

Id: [0x0022F8C3]
It's no longer about me. I'm worried for my son.

Id: [0x0022F8C4]
A boy still needs his father around. Besides, Dikaios is a smart boy. He'll be fine.

Id: [0x0022F8C5]
I've been working to gain intel for Athens as the porter for the Spartan in charge of supplies and troops moving into the area.

Id: [0x0022F8C6]
Have you learned anything interesting?

Id: [0x0022F8C7]
I've learned he's a bastard. And I've learned where we can hit him.

Id: [0x0022F8D9]
I'll try to get the politician home before he completely passes out.

Id: [0x0022F8DA]
Wonderful! Just take him north of the Port of Piraeus. His home is somewhere around there.

Id: [0x0022F8DB]
Will you help me with the politician?

Id: [0x0022F8DF]
Now the world is spinning and bouncing.

Id: [0x0022F8E4]
Why did you bring me here?

Id: [0x0022F8FD]
The commander of the unit I've been spying on suspects me of passing information to the Athenians.

Id: [0x0022F8FE]
Maybe you're not a very good spy.

Id: [0x0022F8FF]
Maybe not. But the Spartan commander is about to have me killed, and Athens needs the information I've written on this papyrus.

Id: [0x0022F90F]
Oh! You won't believe what this section says... "Of the primordial gods..." <i>Primordial</i>!

Id: [0x0022F912]
I won't lower myself to answer that.

Id: [0x0022F91E]
This must be Fort Phyle. If Heitor's right, I'll find the sword inside.

Id: [0x0022F920]
This is Harpe all right. No mistaking this blade.

Id: [0x0022F921]
Another soldier and I came to this cave looking for a place to rest, but a bear attacked us. Its family might still be around, but my leg is badly hurt.

Id: [0x0022F922]
And the other soldier?

Id: [0x0022F923]
The bear saw him first. That's - that's some of him over there, I think.

Id: [0x0022F928]
Hey, thief! That's my sword. I paid good drachmae for that.

Id: [0x0022F932]
Focus, Thaletas. The end is in sight. The Delos Islands will be ours.

Id: [0x0022F933]
We're still outnumbered, but you haven't been wrong yet.

Id: [0x0022F93A]
Hmm... What else?

Id: [0x0022F93B]
Um. This passage mentions something about "inner vision." But... the meaning is unclear.

Id: [0x0022F93C]
It's almost translated. Why aren't you happy?

Id: [0x0022F93D]
You tell me others are hearing things. They think it speaks to them. Yet I hear nothing. I feel nothing.

Id: [0x0022F943]
You wouldn't leave me here, would you, Kassandra?

Id: [0x0022F948]
This is an important find. You said so yourself. Why does it matter what others say or feel?

Id: [0x0022F949]
Kyra...

Id: [0x0022F94A]
And you. I want you both, Thaletas. I know the way you two feel about each other. But...

Id: [0x0022F94F]
I know. I see that it's important from a logical perspective. But what if I can't <i>experience</i> it? And this mention of worth... What if it means I'm not worthy?

Id: [0x0022F955]
I know where the weak Spartan camps are - where their soldiers, ships, and supplies are vulnerable. But I can't compromise my cover to hit them where it hurts.

Id: [0x0022F957]
What if the gods are not worthy of <i>us</i>? Look. We aren't done yet, right? So wait and see.

Id: [0x0022F95A]
Hippokrates - you know it's unwise to upset a patient.

Id: [0x0022F95C]
He asks me to end his life when he knows I can't.

Id: [0x0022F960]
I know you're in pain, but I need some information.

Id: [0x0022F962]
Pain is just part of being mortal. It reminds us that we're alive and keeps us sharp.

Id: [0x0022F963]
I have known many pains in my life. My own suffering isn't what I worry about right now, but making sure my family’s future is secured.

Id: [0x0022F965]
Life is about choice, and we should all be able to choose for ourselves when we leave this world.

Id: [0x0022F966]
And I will, once I know my family’s future is secured.

Id: [0x0022F968]
Secured how?

Id: [0x0022F969]
My family is one of the richest in Thebes, and we have many rivals. When I die, my son will become the head of our house.

Id: [0x0022F96B]
He's just a boy.

Id: [0x0022F96D]
I need to ensure they can't take advantage of my death.

Id: [0x0022F96F]
I'll deal with your rivals and give your son a fighting chance.

Id: [0x0022F972]
Your family will be fine. Stay focused on your treatment, and do what Hippokrates tells you.

Id: [0x0022F974]
What do I need to steal?

Id: [0x0022F975]
To really weaken them, steal their debt registry, their mortgage testimonials, and their collection of fine jewels.

Id: [0x0022F976]
Where do I need to go?

Id: [0x0022F977]
Their estate[2099474] is nearby. It's one of the most finely decorated homes in all of Thebes - except for mine, of course.

Id: [0x0022F978]
Why not just kill them and remove the threat for good?

Id: [0x0022F979]
If they're weakened, they won't pose a threat to my family's position. If they're removed, another family will rise up to take their place and still pose a threat.

Id: [0x0022F97A]
Stealing isn't normally what I'm paid for, but I'll get it done.

Id: [0x0022F97E]
Ah, <i>much </i>better! No one makes a hasty exit like you.

Id: [0x0022F97F]
You're welcome.

Id: [0x0022F995]
It's natural to have doubts. You've convinced me that this search for the past has a value beyond drachmae.

Id: [0x0022F996]
That makes me happy. I just can't help but wonder what the gods think of me.

Id: [0x0022F997]
I think what's important is what you think of yourself.

Id: [0x0022F998]
You cannot simply ask someone else to kill you in my presence. I'm your physician - I will not allow it. I can ease your pain, analyze your symptoms, and try to cure you, but that's all.

Id: [0x0022F999]
Please take care how much you disturb my patient. He's weak and needs to rest.

Id: [0x0022F99C]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. If you steal their assets, it will weaken their position and prevent them from posing a threat to my family. That will buy my son time.

Id: [0x0022F9B0]
Even Hades would shudder in his presence.

Id: [0x0022F9B4]
Thank you, hero.

Id: [0x0022F9B6]
I've been tasked with keeping on eye on Spartan ship movement. I hear a lot of stories from the sailors.

Id: [0x0022F9BC]
I don't have time for sailors' tales. What do you want?

Id: [0x0022F9BE]
And what tales have the sailors been telling you?

Id: [0x0022F9C0]
You mean the one about the mercenary sinking their ships? Or the one about the Spartan commander deciding where the ships move next...

Id: [0x0022F9C2]
Of course not. There's still a war to win. And, for now, we're fighting on the same side.

Id: [0x0022F9C4]
[&laughs]Chaire, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0022F9C6]
<i>Chaire</i>, Barnabas.

Id: [0x0022F9D4]
Are you the Cerberus?

Id: [0x0022F9D5]
Who wants to know?

Id: [0x0022F9D6]
[&phew]Only one head.

Id: [0x0022F9DA]
What's so good about it?

Id: [0x0022F9E6]
The Spartans have taken an innocent woman captive! They say she's a spy.

Id: [0x0022F9E7]
How do you know she's innocent?

Id: [0x0022F9E8]
Because I'm the one who's been selling their information. I can't reveal myself, but I can't leave her either.

Id: [0x0022FA0C]
We should carry on.

Id: [0x0022FA0D]
There are two locations to explore this time. There's a temple[2155417] in the City of Orchomenos. It's near the harbor. The other stele is difficult to pinpoint. There are ruins along the coastline, near the altar for Iphigenia[2041418].

Id: [0x0022FA11]
All right, then. And cheer up. We're almost done.

Id: [0x0022FA12]
If doing this helps bring him some semblance of peace, I will pray for Tyche to watch over you.

Id: [0x0022FA33]
I can't at the moment. I'll return.

Id: [0x0022FA35]
It's very... sweet. Perfect with chestnut bread.

Id: [0x0022FA37]
If you savor your wine, you'll like it. It's very rich.

Id: [0x0022FA3B]
The problem isn't the gods. It's with the person who laid the curse.

Id: [0x0022FA40]
It's a peace offering. A thank you for waiting so patiently for him to pay you back.

Id: [0x0022FA41]
Hmm. [beat]Then drink with me, if you think it's so good.

Id: [0x0022FA43]
He's not gonna win me over with wine. I <i>never </i>forget whose purse my drachmae goes into.

Id: [0x0022FA48]
Well, you tried. I can't ask for more than that. At least we can rely on our friends. [beat]If not, who could we trust?

Id: [0x0022FA51]
The dark age has had its time. Why look backward?

Id: [0x0022FA52]
There is truth and insight in looking backward. Take Homer for example, he often spoke of our past in his stories.

Id: [0x0022FA53]
Hmm. So digging through dirt and cobwebbed words is your ambition?

Id: [0x0022FA57]
Do any of your peers support you in this?

Id: [0x0022FA58]
None. My ways are too different for them.

Id: [0x0022FA5B]
I've been writing dirty lyrics to the marching hymns the Spartans like to sing.

Id: [0x0022FA61]
Been alone behind enemy lines too long?

Id: [0x0022FA63]
Tell me more.

Id: [0x0022FA65]
If they hear our soldiers mocking them with their own songs, it will crush their morale.

Id: [0x0022FA66]
Or they'll become enraged and destroy you all.

Id: [0x0022FA67]
Or that. Orders are orders, though. My commander is awaiting my lyrics. I've written them on this wax tablet. But there are lots of Spartan camps patrolling the route between us.

Id: [0x0022FA6A]
The sword wasn't stolen from you, was it? You used me.

Id: [0x0022FA6C]
Truth be told, I never said it was stolen.

Id: [0x0022FA6D]
You...

Id: [0x0022FA6E]
Ah, a crime of omission only, my friend. You know how important Harpe is to me.

Id: [0x0022FA6F]
I had no money, couldn't fight anymore. I would have died without a drachma by the side of the road. Selling Harpe enabled me to start my business.

Id: [0x0022FA70]
I have a feeling there's more to the story of Harpe's disappearance than you're letting on...

Id: [0x0022FA71]
What? Come now, you've always had such a suspicious mind. Still seeing conspiracies everywhere, are we?

Id: [0x0022FA72]
You've done me a great favor here - let's not sour the celebration.

Id: [0x0022FA76]
No... But I don't like being lied to.

Id: [0x0022FA77]
I'm sorry, OK? I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0022FA84]
One general defected, and is hiding on Delos. These are orders to kill him.

Id: [0x0022FA91]
Just don't tell anyone. Can't have people thinking I'm weak.

Id: [0x0022FA94]
Take care of yourself, Heitor, and try not to <i>lose </i>anything else.

Id: [0x0022FA9A]
I can't thank you enough for returning my sword.

Id: [0x0022FA9B]
You look like a commander to me.

Id: [0x0022FA9C]
I don't recognize our army anymore. The things they do in the name of duty...

Id: [0x0022FAA3]
You don't owe me a thing, really.

Id: [0x0022FAA4]
I'm always happy to help a wealthy noble with his problems.

Id: [0x0022FAA5]
Now... It pains me to ask, but I need your help with one more thing.

Id: [0x0022FAA6]
I know what you want to ask.

Id: [0x0022FAA7]
This disease will claim me, be it today or another in the future. It's a matter of when, not if.

Id: [0x0022FAA8]
Hippokrates won't just let me kill you.

Id: [0x0022FAA9]
No, but he'll listen to you. If you can convince him it's what's best for me, he might change his mind.

Id: [0x0022FAAE]
I've done what you asked. Your family's position will be secure for quite some time.

Id: [0x0022FAAF]
You have given me hope that my name will live on long after I'm gone. All that I ask the gods for now is that my son lives a longer and happier life than I. I'm in your debt.

Id: [0x0022FAB0]
You'll never survive on Delos. I have a ship. Can you fire a bow?

Id: [0x0022FAB1]
I was an archer before I was a commander.

Id: [0x0022FAB2]
And now, you're an archer again. Find my ship, the Adrestia. A man named Barnabas will be waiting for you. He'll keep you safe.

Id: [0x0022FABA]
I'll talk to him for you.

Id: [0x0022FABB]
I appreciate your help. You've shown me more kindness in the last few days than most have my entire life.

Id: [0x0022FABD]
Now, I must rest.

Id: [0x0022FABF]
Hippokrates is stubborn, but for good reason. He believes in helping people, not hurting them. I don't think I'll convince him otherwise.

Id: [0x0022FAC0]
I know he means well, but he must know I'm beyond saving.

Id: [0x0022FAC2]
Still, I understand your choice. Now, I think I need to rest.

Id: [0x0022FACA]
House is boarded up. Must be the place.

Id: [0x0022FC51]
The wolves howl all night here. It's maddening, but also it fills me with... poetry? I wish I knew how to explain their blood... song?

Id: [0x0022FC52]
Blood song? Good thing you're a soldier and not a poet.

Id: [0x0022FC53]
I just need the right material. Something epic about an eagle swooping down on wolves. You could inspire me. [beat]Or at least put an end to that howling.

Id: [0x0022FC76]
You saved my family. <i>Misthios</i>, you are someone I'll never forget.

Id: [0x0022FC7C]
Maybe one day I'll be just like you...

Id: [0x0022FC88]
You were right, I needed to be brave. I needed to stand. And look at the reward - my family, safe.

Id: [0x0022FC8F]
You were right, I'll always be a coward. [beat]In 10,000 years the dust that was my bones will <i>still</i> be cowardly - but that doesn't mean I can't do the right thing. You taught me that.

Id: [0x0022FC91]
Thank you for all you've done. We sail for safer shores. [beat]I hope we never, ever, ever, ever, <i>eeeeeever </i>see each other again.

Id: [0x0022FC93]
Goodbye, [beat]Minotaur.

Id: [0x0022FCA1]
You look heroic. Like a warrior who could kill a whole family of Minotaurs.

Id: [0x0022FCA3]
Really? You're not just saying that?

Id: [0x0022FCA4]
I mean it. Even <i>I'm</i> a bit intimidated by you now.

Id: [0x0022FCA5]
<i>Wow!</i>

Id: [0x0022FCA6]
The gods forgive you. Go.

Id: [0x0022FCAD]
I came for the prize purse, and I mean to leave with it.

Id: [0x0022FCAE]
It's OK guys! I'm a hero now! I'm coming down!

Id: [0x0022FCAF]
I'm not here for the drachmae. I came looking for answers.

Id: [0x0022FCB0]
I'm here to do what the rest of my family couldn't. The purse is a part of that.

Id: [0x0022FCBB]
I saw you fighting out there, <i>misthios</i>. It was impressive. I would say you're Spartan, but what you did is not something they train for at the <i>agoge</i>.

Id: [0x0022FCC3]
I <i>feel</i> pretty heroic.

Id: [0x0022FCC4]
I'm not a typical <i>misthios</i>. This fight will be unlike any you've had before.

Id: [0x0022FCC5]
That may be. But it's my destiny to win this Battle, a destiny that's been years in the making.

Id: [0x0022FCCC]
I <i>am</i> a Spartan by blood. But I'm also just another <i>misthios</i> chasing drachmae.

Id: [0x0022FCCD]
You must have learned to fight like that somewhere.

Id: [0x0022FCCE]
I grew up alone and fought for everything I've ever had. Must have picked up a few tricks along the way.

Id: [0x0022FCD1]
A pity. I hoped to fell a celebrated opponent here to fix my legend. [beat]Oh well. You'll have to do.

Id: [0x0022FCD2]
There will be no legend to sing about until this Battle is finished.

Id: [0x0022FCD4]
Fine. Let's finish it.

Id: [0x0022FCDE]
But... How?! Why would you even -

Id: [0x0022FCE0]
They seemed important.

Id: [0x0022FCE1]
They are, yes - but<i> so are you. </i>Only the Gods could have arranged this.

Id: [0x0022FCE3]
Do I not look as you expect? Yes, <i>misthios, </i>I am a slave - but I am not without dignity.

Id: [0x0022FCE8]
Do you worry that your expectations are too high? It may be a dead end.

Id: [0x0022FCE9]
How can it? The clues have proven me right thus far. The stele mentions a ritual that once performed, will activate something.

Id: [0x0022FD59]
You have the habit of appearing the moment I need you. What a power I may wield.

Id: [0x0022FD5A]
Is there ever a time you don't need me?

Id: [0x0022FD5B]
Good point.

Id: [0x0022FD5C]
You said you needed something?

Id: [0x0022FD5D]
Ah, to business already? Fine, it's simple, really. There's an item that holds great sentimental value I'd like you to retrieve.

Id: [0x0022FD5F]
What do I need to find?

Id: [0x0022FD60]
It's an <i>olisbos</i>. If you saw it on the ground, even you wouldn't bend over... to pick it up. But it means so much to me. To hold it again would mean more than you know.

Id: [0x0022FD63]
I never took you for someone who cared for sentimental things.

Id: [0x0022FD64]
I'm so much more than my beautiful face and flowing blond locks...

Id: [0x0022FD65]
That seems a bit emotional, even for you. You've gone soft.

Id: [0x0022FD66]
I'm anything but <i>soft</i>, I assure you.

Id: [0x0022FD68]
Focus, Alkibiades. What is an <i>olisbos?</i>

Id: [0x0022FD69]
It brings... pleasure. When my body grows too tired after a long night, having one of these can let the fun continue.

Id: [0x0022FF62]
I have to carry you the whole way?

Id: [0x0022FF64]
[beat]A gift for you. Have you ever had Markos's wine? It's the best of the best.

Id: [0x0022FF6E]
My father is dead, killed for revenge against my family, but I am stuck here unable to take vengeance of my own.

Id: [0x0022FF6F]
What kind of a feud are you involved in, exactly?

Id: [0x0022FF70]
The family has always had enemies. My uncle, he says to sue - stop the killing that way. But my heart is an Erinys screaming for revenge.

Id: [0x0022FF76]
Only revenge will restore your family's honor.

Id: [0x0022FF80]
He seems to be resting peacefully now.

Id: [0x0022FF82]
Yes, you helped ease his mind, but he'll never truly be at peace until he takes his last breath.

Id: [0x0022FF85]
It's hard to tell. Judging by his symptoms, it'll be sooner rather than later.

Id: [0x0022FF8F]
Did you gather the hemlock?

Id: [0x0022FF92]
Not yet, I have some questions first.

Id: [0x0022FF98]
He wants to die and he's in pain. You should respect his right to choose instead of treating him like an experiment. What you're doing is wrong.

Id: [0x0022FFB6]
Hemlock is rare. Where do you harvest it?

Id: [0x0022FFBA]
Why are you treating him with poison? Hemlock is deadly.

Id: [0x0022FFBC]
I'll get the hemlock you need.

Id: [0x0022FFBF]
Your family is precious. You must protect what is left of it. But if you go, you'll be a deserter.

Id: [0x0022FFC1]
If I could take this life myself I would. But I've been posted here to safeguard villagers against bandits.

Id: [0x0022FFC7]
You're a big boy. Get it yourself?

Id: [0x0022FFC8]
I sure am... But there's a small chance the woman who has it won't exactly be happy to see me again.

Id: [0x0022FFC9]
There has to be a story behind this thing.

Id: [0x0022FFCA]
When you see the <i>olisbos</i>, you'll know. When you have it in your hands, against your skin... When you feel the weight of it, you'll know.

Id: [0x0022FFCB]
I'll get the <i>olisbos</i> for you.

Id: [0x0022FFCC]
There's a small chance the woman may wish to keep it for herself... to spite me. It may be best to go unseen and hurry back. She lives east of here.

Id: [0x0022FFCD]
Don't worry, you'll have it in your hands soon.

Id: [0x0022FFD2]
Ah, that's it in your hand! You brought it.

Id: [0x0022FFD4]
Hm, it's different than I remember it looking... And much bigger too. She's going to miss it.

Id: [0x0022FFD5]
This was never yours, was it? You had me steal it.

Id: [0x0022FFD6]
We didn't just steal an <i>olisbos</i> - we stole a family heirloom and a husband's confidence. Without it, he'll be focused on his wife instead of his business. [beat]I think she'll enjoy the change of pace.

Id: [0x0022FFDD]
The drunk politician you had me take home... We ran into a bit of trouble.

Id: [0x0022FFDE]
That's terrible! I'm glad to see you're OK.

Id: [0x0022FFE1]
Yes, thankfully we both made it out alive.

Id: [0x0022FFE2]
Oh. I see. [beat]Thank you for telling me.

Id: [0x0022FFE4]
Yes, but he didn't make it out alive. We were attacked by a group of men.

Id: [0x0022FFE5]
Really? Well, you did your best.

Id: [0x0022FFF2]
You seem disappointed.

Id: [0x0022FFF3]
I'm just... impressed you were able to save the both of you.

Id: [0x0022FFF4]
You don't seem that surprised.

Id: [0x0022FFF5]
Don't you worry about this. You did what I asked you to do. His death is not on your hands.

Id: [0x00230084]
Then go get it.

Id: [0x00230086]
You lied. Again.

Id: [0x00230087]
I don't think I did. I was very particular with my words.

Id: [0x00230088]
You said it was sentimental.

Id: [0x00230089]
It is. Just not to me. There wasn't a single lie.

Id: [0x0023008A]
That's not how it feels.

Id: [0x0023008B]
So it's sentimental... just not to you.

Id: [0x0023008E]
The only thing that matters is you retrieved the <i>olisbos</i> and helped me a great deal.

Id: [0x0023008F]
And what about me?

Id: [0x00230090]
Now, now. We wash each other's backs, don't we? There's a reason you never turn me down, after all. [beat]How about I show you how this <i>olisbos</i> can make all the difference?

Id: [0x00230094]
I knew I'd see you again... But what I'd really like to see is my <i>olisbos</i>.

Id: [0x00230095]
Did you need something else?

Id: [0x00230099]
And we will find them.

Id: [0x002300B4]
It's made out of stone... I guess that could work.

Id: [0x002300B9]
Stop her! She robbed me!

Id: [0x002300BB]
I thought I'd make a great warrior. But in this battle I've barely managed not to soil myself.

Id: [0x002300C1]
Your cowardice will get your fellow soldiers killed. You need to be brave.

Id: [0x002300C2]
Oh, I will fight. And try, at least, to die well. But there's a woman I love - I've written her a letter. Lies about how well I am doing. To remember me by.

Id: [0x002300C4]
Not everyone is made for fighting, friend.

Id: [0x002300C6]
When will that be?

Id: [0x002300C7]
I still need hemlock for the pain if you're able.

Id: [0x002300C8]
I will not be lectured on the morality of my work by a sell-sword. I have a responsibility, like all healers, to use my knowledge for the betterment of others.

Id: [0x002300C9]
I can't imagine how difficult this must be, but I know you're doing what you can to help him.

Id: [0x002300CA]
Sometimes I worry that it's never enough. First the plague, and now this. The ailments that afflict man are as varied as the gods. It would take me many lifetimes to learn about them all.

Id: [0x002300CF]
I'll collect the ingredients you need.

Id: [0x002300D0]
Thank you. It won't stop the pain entirely, but I hope it'll help him feel more comfortable.

Id: [0x002300D1]
He doesn't want to feel better. He wants to die with some dignity.

Id: [0x002300D2]
True dignity would be fighting through this so I can analyze his symptoms further.

Id: [0x002300D3]
I don't have time for this right now.

Id: [0x002300D5]
It grows all across Boeotia, but check near the Tumulus of Plataia. I'm sure I saw some when I was last there.

Id: [0x002300D7]
Only in the wrong dosage. If my observations are correct, it should lessen the pain wracking his body.

Id: [0x002300DA]
There you are! I was starting to think you wouldn't show up.

Id: [0x002300DB]
You!

Id: [0x002300DC]
Hello, Himilko. Long time.

Id: [0x002300DD]
Heitor, what's going on? Why are you here?

Id: [0x002300DE]
Of course. He didn't tell you, did he? You've been used, my friend.

Id: [0x002300DF]
Shut up. I'm not here to hear you talk. I'm here to see you die.

Id: [0x002300E9]
Bloody footprints. A child's... Must have been hiding in that chest.

Id: [0x002300EF]
This blood trail's old.

Id: [0x002300FE]
We both shared guilt in that, but she was <i>my</i> wife!

Id: [0x00230104]
I can lessen his pain, but to do so, I'll need some hemlock.

Id: [0x0023010B]
You mean for lying. I'm done with old times - it's why I left Kephallonia.

Id: [0x0023011D]
All right.

Id: [0x0023011F]
The wine's yours.

Id: [0x00230120]
I insist.

Id: [0x00230121]
I'm not thirsty.

Id: [0x00230123]
You're hiding something. If you don't drink, I'll know it's poisoned.

Id: [0x00230125]
It's not poison. Drink it.

Id: [0x00230127]
Guards!

Id: [0x0023012B]
Ah, the sea. Violent and peaceful. Beautiful and deadly. Reminds me of a woman I used to love, actually. I miss her.

Id: [0x00230131]
I have work to do. Blade work. People who waste my time... get added to my work.

Id: [0x00230133]
Well, that's nice... Was there something you wanted?

Id: [0x00230135]
Right. The Spartans trying to control the sea makes me terribly jealous. You've got a reputation for sinking ships... And those Spartans need to disappear from the horizon.

Id: [0x0023013B]
I found the stele piece and more armor. These clues have some truth to them.

Id: [0x0023013F]
It's poisoned!

Id: [0x00230140]
No, that's just the wine.

Id: [0x00230141]
You tricked me!

Id: [0x00230142]
I'm gonna be sick...

Id: [0x0023015C]
If you have a moment, I would ask you to help me with something.

Id: [0x00230169]
I got the hemlock you wanted.

Id: [0x0023016A]
Thank you. I know this task was a little beneath you, but it will help my friend here.

Id: [0x00230170]
He was suffering. I did what was necessary.

Id: [0x00230172]
I did what I knew was right - and what you couldn't do.

Id: [0x0023017D]
The potion is working. With what I learn here, I could help many more who still have a chance at life.

Id: [0x00230182]
What? What's happened? He shouldn't have died yet.

Id: [0x00230184]
What did you do?

Id: [0x00230186]
And you'd like me to help him escape.

Id: [0x00230187]
Yes, I think you owe me this.

Id: [0x00230189]
What's this man to you really?

Id: [0x0023018A]
How could you say that!

Id: [0x0023018D]
It wouldn't be the first time you've led me astray.

Id: [0x0023018E]
By the gods, this man is one of us, Kassandra. A misthios, an old comrade. We should help out a brother. Please, will you rescue him for me?

Id: [0x00230193]
So many dead. We're trying to recover the bodies, but there are so <i>many</i>.

Id: [0x00230194]
That's horrible.

Id: [0x00230195]
It is. Thank you. I'll keep doing my part. Collect the - what needs collecting. But there's wolves and worse than wolves around here.

Id: [0x00230196]
What's worse than wolves?

Id: [0x00230197]
You haven't seen? Lucky you. Cannibals have been doing - well, you know - with the bodies. I won't leave my friends to be eaten by beasts. Or by wolves.

Id: [0x002301A5]
Misthios! The dogs of war howl for blood. But we need help if we're to push the Athenians into the sea where they belong.

Id: [0x002301A6]
I'll do whatever it takes.

Id: [0x002301AA]
I've prepared the elixir base, but I need you to grind the herb and add it to the mixture.

Id: [0x002301AB]
I think I can handle that.

Id: [0x002301AC]
Be mindful of the amount you add. While the hemlock is an excellent pain inhibitor, too much can be lethal.

Id: [0x002301B1]
Salt fish and porridge. Salt fish. Porridge. Salt. Fish. Porridge. All we have to eat is what we bring ourselves.

Id: [0x002301B2]
Food not to your liking?

Id: [0x002301B3]
The Spartans are cooking up a fine stew in their camp. Even the raiders around here have better food. I’d kill for a juicy goat... Well, I'd pay someone else to kill for me.

Id: [0x002301BF]
Shut up, murderer!

Id: [0x002301C0]
You lied to me again. This isn't how friendships work, Heitor.

Id: [0x002301C1]
Listen, please. I'm sorry, but you don't know what this man did to me.

Id: [0x002301C2]
That's fucking rich, Heitor. Why don't you tell her the truth?

Id: [0x002301C4]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002301C5]
Just an old mercenary's remorse that he couldn't have done more while the people he cared for were alive.

Id: [0x002301D0]
He seems to be calmer now.

Id: [0x002301EB]
Oh, just get it over with. To be honest, it will be a relief for me. We're both guilty - at least <i>I</i> can accept that.

Id: [0x002301F8]
It wasn't your place. I needed more time - there was still more I could have learned.

Id: [0x002301F9]
Keeping him alive so you can study him isn't right. He was in pain and wanted to die.

Id: [0x002301FA]
You're right. I knew I couldn't bring myself to end his life, but I thought the more I learned, the better chance I would have of saving others in the future.

Id: [0x002301FB]
Treating patients should come before studying ailments, but I have a higher calling. If I'm to learn all I can, I need to travel and analyze the conditions other physicians are treating.

Id: [0x00230203]
Here, have it. It's lovely, no?

Id: [0x00230204]
Yes, it will fit nicely in my collection.

Id: [0x00230205]
Why?

Id: [0x00230206]
Because he killed the love of my life.

Id: [0x00230208]
What a pretty, pretty thing.

Id: [0x0023020E]
Get him!

Id: [0x00230213]
Misthios! Athens still controls this rock. Send more Athenians to the underworld so we can claim the Delos Islands for Sparta!

Id: [0x0023021D]
He's dying!

Id: [0x0023021F]
Thaletas! No!

Id: [0x00230222]
How could I ever trust you?

Id: [0x00230228]
Is the fugitive the man you saved?

Id: [0x0023022A]
Your wife?

Id: [0x0023022B]
She wouldn't have died if...

Id: [0x0023022C]
What? If I hadn't caught you? If you hadn't attacked me? If she hadn't tried to stop us? If our blades hadn't struck her down? Who's to blame here?

Id: [0x00230231]
That was your father - it's not safe for you here anymore.

Id: [0x00230233]
You'd like that, wouldn't you? I know Markos wants me dead. And now, I want <i>you </i>dead.

Id: [0x00230239]
Stop that man!

Id: [0x0023023D]
Eagle Bearer! The Athenian grip is weakening thanks to you. Keep fighting, warrior. Sparta's sons are close, and their blades are sharp.

Id: [0x0023023F]
And that's all that's important to you in the end isn't it? Easing your conscience.

Id: [0x00230244]
Why would that man jeopardize his family to kill a Spartan?

Id: [0x0023024A]
Some celebration.

Id: [0x0023024C]
Your clue was right. I found a part of the stele. Along with another piece of armor.

Id: [0x00230252]
Ah, she's returned! Let me guess... the Cerberus wants to order another amphora's worth.

Id: [0x002302BC]
He wouldn't even drink it - he thought it was poisoned.

Id: [0x002302BD]
Nonsense! Who would think such a thing of Markos? Go to him, try again.

Id: [0x002302BE]
Not a chance. His bodyguards went after me. He's not happy.

Id: [0x002302BF]
Oh. That is not a good thing.

Id: [0x002302C0]
The wine made us sick, Markos.

Id: [0x002302C1]
Impossible! It was my best batch. I double checked.

Id: [0x002302C2]
If you wanted him dead, you should've told me.

Id: [0x002302C3]
I did tell you - I'm a new Markos! I don't want people dead, I want what's right. [beat]But... that isn't good news.

Id: [0x002302C6]
Eagle Bearer! My name is Herodianos, second to Thaletas in battle. The dogs of war howl for blood, and thanks to you, Sparta now howls back.

Id: [0x002302C7]
Sounds like a lot of howling.

Id: [0x002302C9]
Ares smiles on Sparta, Eagle Bearer. You've carved a path in Athenian blood!

Id: [0x002302CA]
Your troops are free to march to the beaches.

Id: [0x002302CD]
Fight with us. Together we'll run our shields through their skulls, and spears through their hearts.

Id: [0x002302D1]
No, it's not good. The Cerberus will come after you.

Id: [0x002302D2]
What to do, what to do...?

Id: [0x002302D7]
I need a very specific herb to treat this fever. The Athenians have stores of it in their camp, but those wretched soldiers are pretty stingy about who they give it to.

Id: [0x002302DF]
This chest plate has some use, but there has to be more than this.

Id: [0x002302E0]
If one stele revealed that armor, then there must be more. The pieces may even be better.

Id: [0x002302E1]
Hmm. I'll hold you to that. All right, where should I look for the stele piece?

Id: [0x002302E6]
I can't deny that something ancient has passed this way. But if it mentions something about the gods... you may be stirring up trouble you can't handle.

Id: [0x002302E7]
Don't worry about me, <i>misthios!</i> Where you are skilled with instinct, I am of logical mind. Uncovering knowledge is never a bad thing.

Id: [0x002302EA]
I'd be honored to fight with Sparta.

Id: [0x002302EB]
To battle!

Id: [0x002302ED]
I'm honored, Spartan. I'll come back when I'm ready for battle.

Id: [0x002302EE]
Eagle Bearer! My warriors thirst for Athenian blood. Fight with us and help us turn the tide of this war.

Id: [0x002302F6]
I don't know why we're sitting here starving and fending off raider attacks. The solution is simple.

Id: [0x002302F7]
Oh?

Id: [0x002302F8]
Well, as I see it, we need food, and we need the bandits dead. The bandits, by the way, have plenty of food.

Id: [0x002302FC]
What's the connection between this tomb and those worshippers?

Id: [0x002302FD]
The writing mentions "of the gods." It's not clear which gods, though. Once we decipher more, we should understand the connection.

Id: [0x0023030D]
There is a girl I love, <i>misthios</i>. I think if I had stayed home, she would love me, too. But now I am posted here, and I hear there is a poet whispering his clever words in her ear.

Id: [0x0023030E]
Send her your own love letter, then.

Id: [0x0023030F]
Oh. Do you think that would work? I was just going to have the poet killed.

Id: [0x00230312]
[beat]What am I saying? Kassandra, <i>this</i> is when we strike.

Id: [0x00230322]
My younger brother died in the battle, <i>misthios</i>. In my arms. I swore I would protect him and I failed.

Id: [0x00230328]
Soldiers die in war. You are not the only one who has lost.

Id: [0x00230329]
Yes, many have suffered. But I thought I could... It doesn't matter. His cloak should go to his widow. But I can't face her. Her, and his little children.

Id: [0x0023032B]
I know the pain of loss.

Id: [0x0023032D]
You have a reputation for being able to make problems disappear... quietly.

Id: [0x00230333]
And what is this "problem" that needs taking care of?

Id: [0x00230335]
I can do quiet. For a price.

Id: [0x00230337]
The commander of my unit is a fool. Half of us died in a terribly planned raid. He needs to be relieved of his command.

Id: [0x00230338]
Killing him would be treason.

Id: [0x00230339]
It's only treason if we're found out. So long as we keep things quiet, we'll be saving lives.

Id: [0x00230349]
Our position is weak. The Spartans will drive us back if we don't do something quickly.

Id: [0x0023034F]
You're a soldier. Fight back.

Id: [0x00230351]
Stay strong. Your fellow soldiers are depending on you.

Id: [0x00230353]
You're right. But the unit that keeps engaging us - we just aren't a match for them. They fight like Titans! We need to even the odds.

Id: [0x00230355]
It's you! The one who wiped out an entire Spartan fort! Surely, you are sent by the gods.

Id: [0x0023035B]
Good. You recognize divine power when you see it.

Id: [0x0023035D]
It's just skill and training, friend.

Id: [0x0023035F]
The area is crawling with well-supplied Spartans, and their commander has them targeting us relentlessly. We won't survive another attack. At least, not without your help.

Id: [0x0023036F]
What poisons?

Id: [0x00230370]
Poisons for your arrow tips. Didn't they tell you? I've had the order ready for a week, but your commander never sent anyone to get it.

Id: [0x00230371]
No one sent me for any poisons.

Id: [0x00230372]
They didn't? If they don't get this delivery soon, they'll move on, and I'll be out the drachmae. These need to get to the camp!

Id: [0x00230373]
There's a group of Spartan soldiers near the camp. We know they're there, and those dogs need killing, but our commander refuses to act until reinforcements come.

Id: [0x00230379]
Not much of a commander if he's afraid of a few Spartans.

Id: [0x0023037B]
Maybe your commander is waiting for an advantage before taking action.

Id: [0x0023037D]
Well, maybe he is, but I say it's time someone did something. With you here, we have all the advantage we'll need to strike at the Spartan filth.

Id: [0x0023037F]
Ever since we took over the village, there's a citizen sowing dissent and turning the villagers against us. Something must be done.

Id: [0x00230380]
Are you really going to silence people who are just speaking their mind?

Id: [0x00230381]
Talking is fine, if it stops at that. I don't want to cut down villagers, <i>misthios</i>. But that is the order I'll be given if they attack a soldier again.

Id: [0x00230396]
The merchant boats around here are transporting and delivering military supplies for the Spartans. I need that situation... improved.

Id: [0x00230398]
I don't know what an armillary sphere is.

Id: [0x00230399]
Oh! Well, they are very rare. It's a mechanism that shows the objects in the sky.

Id: [0x0023039B]
Why not go get it yourself?

Id: [0x0023039C]
Bandits have it in their camp. They're too dangerous for someone like me.

Id: [0x002303A7]
You can predict earthquakes? How?

Id: [0x002303A8]
I've been studying the land, taking measurements, and it all adds up the same.

Id: [0x002303A9]
If you really believe there's going to be an earthquake...

Id: [0x002303AA]
I don't believe it. I know it. The numbers don't lie.

Id: [0x002303AB]
Then you need to warn people.

Id: [0x002303AC]
I tried. Everyone thinks I'm raving. But if someone were to carry a message - someone official looking. [beat]It would make them listen.

Id: [0x002303AF]
They're outsourcing to foreigners! Getting their supplies from Skythia instead of using local herbs, like I do. If something were to happen to their shipments, however, people would be forced to buy from me.

Id: [0x002303B9]
You have the look of a hunter. Why not take care of the beast yourself?

Id: [0x002303BA]
It may be a killer, but a lion is a divine being. I wouldn't dream of angering the gods by hunting it!

Id: [0x00230627]
Come on! We need this to be a fight we are remembered for.

Id: [0x00230629]
Finally. Not playing anymore, are we?

Id: [0x0023062A]
No, we're not.

Id: [0x0023062F]
Yes! This is the kind of fight we'll be remembered for.

Id: [0x00230635]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x00230636]
No more games! Tell me what you know about the Cult.

Id: [0x00230655]
It just got a lot nicer. I was hoping to see you again.

Id: [0x00230656]
Alkibiades. What are you doing outside of Athens?

Id: [0x00230657]
I'm sure you have.

Id: [0x00230659]
You were with my wife. What did you expect? It is my right to restore my honor!

Id: [0x00230661]
Why you...

Id: [0x002306B5]
No, she loved me. She told me so. We were going to run away together.

Id: [0x002306B6]
[&laughs]She'd leave her home for you, with nothing. I heard you had to sell your sword, the only thing you ever owned of value. Why would she go with a lowly misthios?

Id: [0x002306B7]
[&scream]You malákes need to sort this out between yourselves.

Id: [0x002306B9]
You're both at fault in her death. And Heitor... I don't know, and don't want to know, why you were sleeping with another man's wife.

Id: [0x002306BA]
We were in love!

Id: [0x002306BB]
You idiot. Do you think you were the only one? When we went on campaigns, do you think she worried about her husband? About as much as we worried about our wives!

Id: [0x002306BE]
Sometimes the past won't let us go easy.

Id: [0x002306C3]
A power I wield indeed! I told you last time I thought I could summon you when needed, and it has happened yet again.

Id: [0x002306CB]
If you have the power to make me come when you want, stop using it.

Id: [0x002306CC]
Oh I'll... no. That's too easy. [beat]Anyways, the power doesn't work every time, sadly. You weren't in my bed last night, no matter how many times I thought of you.

Id: [0x002306CD]
So, do you want to lie to me now, or later?

Id: [0x002306CE]
Whatever do you mean?

Id: [0x002306CF]
Is this "friend" of yours actually a friend? I'm not going to find out they're a wanted criminal, or they don't actually want your help, am I?

Id: [0x002306D0]
I'm hurt that you'd jump straight to accusations. A relationship must be built on trust, after all.

Id: [0x002306E7]
Oh, misthios, you are still alive! Did you find the bandits? They must be looting the Mycenaean Tomb of Ajax.

Id: [0x002306F0]
Another stele fragment and armor without your clues. Perhaps the gods are guiding me.

Id: [0x00230732]
And for what this time?

Id: [0x00230733]
My friend here needs to be taken to the Sanctuary of Eleusis near the border of Megaris. He'll finish the trek across the border on his own.

Id: [0x00230734]
I'm always happy to help a friend of yours. Is this one drunk as well?

Id: [0x00230735]
Not at all. And that politician was <i>not</i> my friend.

Id: [0x00230738]
Fuck you, Alkibiades. To get trust, you have to prove you deserve it. And you've lied to me more than once.

Id: [0x00230739]
You and I have different views of trust, nothing more. I've kept things to myself, but never to hurt you.

Id: [0x0023073B]
You're right. Just remember, trust goes both ways.

Id: [0x0023073C]
I'm very familiar with things that go both ways.

Id: [0x0023073E]
Let's get to it. I'm just supposed to take your friend across the border?

Id: [0x0023073F]
Carefully, if you can. Avoid roads, people... Be invisible. My friend must be kept safe.

Id: [0x00230797]
Thank the gods you're here. A hunting party has been attacked outside the city, near the Cursed Land of Oedipus.

Id: [0x00230798]
Any survivors?

Id: [0x00230799]
This man saw dead bodies, but he could still hear screaming.

Id: [0x0023079B]
I need you to go and rescue whoever is still alive, and put an end to the dangerous beast that attacked them.

Id: [0x002307A0]
There's no time to waste. We must help those in danger.

Id: [0x002307A5]
Did you find the survivor of the hunting party?

Id: [0x002307AE]
All right, I'll destroy the beast and if anyone's still in one piece.

Id: [0x002307AF]
If they are, bring them back to me, and I'll do what I can to save them.

Id: [0x002307B1]
I'm not interested in saving foolish hunters right now.

Id: [0x002307B7]
There are many dangerous beasts out in the wild. If someone is injured, they won't last long.

Id: [0x002307BA]
If they weren't ready to face the beasts out in the wild, they shouldn't have gone hunting. Nature is not kind to those who underestimate her.

Id: [0x002307C1]
There are a lot of hunting grounds nearby. Where should I look?

Id: [0x002307C2]
They were sighted following animal tracks around Snake Head Rock.

Id: [0x002307C3]
How many people will I find out there?

Id: [0x002307C4]
It sounded like only one hunter was left alive, but hunting parties usually contain three or four people.

Id: [0x002307C5]
I'll go and find the trail.

Id: [0x002307C8]
I'll make sure he's safe.

Id: [0x002307C9]
I'd hoped you'd say that.

Id: [0x002307CA]
Your friend has feet. He can walk.

Id: [0x00230820]
Do you know what attacked them?

Id: [0x00230821]
Not for certain. The roar could have been from any number of beasts... Many predators call the wilds of Boeotia their home.

Id: [0x00230822]
Every time you ask me to do something secretly, someone dies. What is it this time?

Id: [0x00230823]
Not everyone was born with your beautiful muscles built for... well, everything. Some of us work better by <i>avoiding</i> fights. This time, that's all I ask.

Id: [0x00230824]
There are lots of safe passages through these parts. Tell your friend to go alone.

Id: [0x00230825]
He could, but imagine if something happened, and you saved him. <i>Imagine</i> the things I'd do to show my gratitude.

Id: [0x00230826]
We should be on our way.

Id: [0x00230827]
He needs to get to the Sanctuary of Eleusis. It isn't far, although it may take you longer than usual.

Id: [0x00230828]
It won't be a problem.

Id: [0x0023082A]
What?! When did this happen?

Id: [0x0023082B]
Earlier today. I was taking my boy fishing when we heard the screams.

Id: [0x0023082C]
What were they doing out there?

Id: [0x0023082D]
Hunting party, I think.

Id: [0x0023082E]
We must send aid at once.

Id: [0x0023084C]
Strike? You and what army?

Id: [0x0023084D]
I have a demi-god for a best friend! That's an army as strong as twenty soldiers.

Id: [0x0023084E]
Three?!

Id: [0x0023084F]
Why do you think they're called the Cerberus? Because they're three brothers - triplets! Each with as much bite as the last.

Id: [0x00230850]
Not on your way yet?

Id: [0x00230851]
Care to help my friend across the border?

Id: [0x00230854]
Ah, that's better. I was starting to get sweaty under that hood.

Id: [0x00230855]
You're a woman!

Id: [0x00230856]
Nice of you to notice.

Id: [0x00230857]
Alkibiades said-

Id: [0x00230858]
Exactly what I told him to. It was safer that way. I owe Alkibiades a lot for his help, and for trusting you with my life, as well.

Id: [0x00230859]
Enough lies. Tell me what's happening.

Id: [0x0023085A]
I said I was a man so nobody would recognize me. I needed to escape my husband unseen.

Id: [0x0023085B]
And you trusted Alkibiades?

Id: [0x0023085C]
No one escapes my husband - he'd find me. It's been... tough. I'm not sure I would have lasted much longer.

Id: [0x0023085D]
I'm glad I could help.

Id: [0x0023085E]
Please give Alkibiades my thanks. I only wish I had more to offer him, and you, for the help. I'll never forget either of you.

Id: [0x0023086A]
What are you doing back alone? I take it you didn't rescue my friend?

Id: [0x00230873]
Great. So there are two others that'll want revenge.

Id: [0x00230874]
Wait a minute, wait a minute - that means two of them haven't tried my wine!

Id: [0x00230882]
Who would? They're tunics for Minotaurs.

Id: [0x0023088C]
Where's the rest of him?

Id: [0x0023088D]
Sounds like even Minotaur statues are deadly.

Id: [0x00230895]
You're doing all this for your grandmother?

Id: [0x00230897]
She puts on a brave face for me, but I hear her crying at night when she thinks I'm asleep. She's always moaning, or vomiting, or moaning <i>and</i> vomiting.

Id: [0x00230898]
That's the most pathetic lie I've ever heard. [beat]And I lived on Kephallonia.

Id: [0x00230899]
Yeah, well, it was worth a shot.

Id: [0x002308B2]
You're not getting one drachma out of me.

Id: [0x002308B8]
You flew like the west wind in retrieving my golden eagle feather. [beat]Now, fetch me another rarity.

Id: [0x002308C8]
Sorry, Xenia. Another time, perhaps.

Id: [0x002308DB]
Either way, he's dead now.

Id: [0x002308DC]
Dead? That's just <i>great</i>. [beat]I guess there's only <i>two</i> left to deal with now.

Id: [0x002308DD]
Two?

Id: [0x002308DE]
The Cerberus is three men. Brothers! That's why they're called the Cerberus... Get it?

Id: [0x002309B3]
Now you tell me. [beat]Expect revenge from the brothers, then.

Id: [0x002309BD]
You have it all figured out, don't you?

Id: [0x002309BE]
There's only three of them, plus their little group of men. It'll be easy, my friend!

Id: [0x002309C9]
So what are you going to do?

Id: [0x002309CA]
They need to be spooked. As Mama says, a threat is like a bear - very scary! We'll burn the Cerberus's farm. Specifically, the silos.

Id: [0x002309D2]
A wealthy noble from Makedonia is visiting various sanctuaries throughout the Aegean, looking for the most sacred to make a great offering.

Id: [0x002309D7]
Good people of Delos, your hearts are big, but we must use our minds in this matter.

Id: [0x002309D8]
He deserves death! We demand justice!

Id: [0x002309D9]
Though putting the man to death would be justice for whom? Can a citizen truly be partial when justice is sought? Must we not first define what justice is?

Id: [0x002309DA]
Don't listen to Athenians! They do nothing but talk, talk, talk! We want action!

Id: [0x002309DB]
Ship the rebel to Mykonos, where nothing is sacred. Kill him there!

Id: [0x002309DC]
Life has value, no matter where you are.

Id: [0x002309DE]
The filthy rebel stole from the sanctuary[2105519]! He spilled blood on sacred soil!

Id: [0x002309E1]
It better work... Though I'm skeptical.

Id: [0x002309E2]
It's even worth sacrificing them as potential customers.

Id: [0x002309E4]
Later. Hopefully they won't get to you in the meantime.

Id: [0x002309EB]
I'll pay their farm a visit.

Id: [0x002309EC]
Give them a good scare. I'm pretty sure it's the farm in Astypalia City... Their goons are always hanging around.

Id: [0x002309ED]
Got it.

Id: [0x002309EF]
Do you want the crops burned, too?

Id: [0x002309F0]
They grow herbs - harmless plants for medicine. It's just the silos that should go. Blow them up!

Id: [0x002309FC]
Sokrates! You just make friends wherever you go, don't you?

Id: [0x002309FD]
Kassandra! What a pleasant surprise. What brings you to Delos?

Id: [0x00230A07]
You couldn't have mentioned there were three of them before?

Id: [0x00230A08]
I thought it was implied. Having triplets runs in their family.

Id: [0x00230A09]
That's a lot of cerberuses.

Id: [0x00230A0A]
Let's hope they don't procreate and have Cerberus puppies.

Id: [0x00230A32]
I'm helping a group of Delian rebels.

Id: [0x00230A34]
[&hmm]But do they truly need help? Is not the decision to rebel enough to release one from oppression?

Id: [0x00230A36]
That's not a good idea.

Id: [0x00230A37]
When have you had reason not to trust me? [beat]Don't answer that, my friend. Just trust me!

Id: [0x00230A3A]
I came here for the leader of the Delos Islands. The people suffered under him for too long.

Id: [0x00230A62]
And their suffering is worth his life?

Id: [0x00230A64]
Yes, it was. His death was unavoidable.

Id: [0x00230A65]
As unavoidable as death is for all of us?

Id: [0x00230A69]
Podarkes is one of the people hunting my family, Sokrates. His death is unavoidable.

Id: [0x00230A6A]
[&breath]Aren't all deaths ultimately unavoidable?

Id: [0x00230A6D]
Oh, no you don't. I’m not getting sucked into one of these debates again.

Id: [0x00230A7E]
How's the patient?

Id: [0x00230A7F]
He'll survive <i>if</i> I treat his injuries.

Id: [0x00230A80]
If?

Id: [0x00230A81]
This man is a monster. He's a slave trader who treats people so terribly that they injure themselves just to avoid working for him.

Id: [0x00230A83]
If I help him, he'll continue to hurt others. But if I choose to do nothing, many will be spared pain and suffering.

Id: [0x00230A88]
If you free the slaves, I can heal this monster.

Id: [0x00230A8D]
Are the slaves free?

Id: [0x00230A8E]
I need to know something first.

Id: [0x00230A94]
Of course I'll free the slaves for you.

Id: [0x00230A95]
Thank you, my friend.

Id: [0x00230A99]
Those slaves' freedom is their own to fight for.

Id: [0x00230A9F]
This man is a rich slaver. If we save him, he'll reward us both. Think of the people you could help with that drachmae.

Id: [0x00230AA0]
No amount of money can undo the damage he's inflicted upon innocent people. Men like him think they can pay their way out of every situation, even death. He's wrong. No one can escape the Ferryman forever.

Id: [0x00230AA2]
It shouldn't matter what this man has done, he deserves to be treated like anyone else. We can't judge others when they're at our mercy.

Id: [0x00230AA3]
I know it's my duty to help this man, but if you'd seen some of the injuries I've treated that he's caused, you would understand my doubts. The innocents of the Greek world have suffered enough lately.

Id: [0x00230AA9]
Where are the slaves being held?

Id: [0x00230AAA]
I remember paying a visit to a camp on the river bank east of Lake Kopais to treat a slave for self-inflicted injuries. I'd try there.

Id: [0x00230AAB]
Are hunting parties often attacked this close to the city?

Id: [0x00230AAC]
It's quite unusual, but with the war raging all around us, and the plague consuming everything else, it's no surprise the beasts are becoming more desperate.

Id: [0x00230AAD]
If the slaves are in danger, I’ll need to hurry.

Id: [0x00230AB2]
Alkibiades? He <i>is </i>persistent...

Id: [0x00230AEC]
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

Id: [0x00230AF1]
What the fuck? My silos! Stop!

Id: [0x00230AF3]
The local Spartan commander enjoys figs with honey. I'd like to send him some, but he can't know they're from me.

Id: [0x00230AF4]
Why are you sending him a snack?

Id: [0x00230AF5]
Not a snack. His last meal.

Id: [0x00230B07]
Did you know poison hemlock tastes like parsnip, but smells like mice?

Id: [0x00230B08]
Should I ask how you know that?

Id: [0x00230B09]
No. There's a bandit gang near here that owes me some, but I'm having a little trouble getting them to pay up. Besides, I'm a little busy setting up a drinking party for the Spartans.

Id: [0x00230B0E]
One more silo to go.

Id: [0x00230B13]
Done. I'll tell Markos it made quite the impression.

Id: [0x00230B18]
That's one silo down.

Id: [0x00230C9B]
My commander is in love with a priestess of Hecate.

Id: [0x00230C9C]
What's wrong with that?

Id: [0x00230C9D]
She asked him for a letter expressing his eternal devotion, written in his blood.

Id: [0x00230C9E]
And he gave it to her?

Id: [0x00230C9F]
Love turns people into idiots. I just know she's going to do something evil with that letter.

Id: [0x00230CA4]
The Cerberus should stay away from you now.

Id: [0x00230CA5]
Er, well, maybe not after all. One of the farmers ran over. She was uh, not happy.

Id: [0x00230CA6]
Why?

Id: [0x00230CA7]
It seems I may have - or, I did - accidentally, of course... sent you to someone else's farm.

Id: [0x00230CA8]
It wasn't the Cerberus's farm.

Id: [0x00230CA9]
I could have sworn it belonged to the Cerberus! You have to believe me, my friend - an honest mistake.

Id: [0x00230CB0]
The sun and moon combined could not grant the beauty that my bride-to-be was gifted! If the gods blessed me, they did so with one eye closed. [beat]But their eyes were wide open for her.

Id: [0x00230CB4]
Please stop. Your poetry is sweet enough to make someone vomit.

Id: [0x00230CB5]
I won't stop until the whole world knows how I feel.

Id: [0x00230CB8]
I'm impressed. If I only heard the words, I'd swear you were a poet.

Id: [0x00230CB9]
My words are nowhere near what she deserves.

Id: [0x00230CBA]
I'm hurt. You never talk about me like that.

Id: [0x00230CBB]
My sweet <i>misthios, </i>such words can not be handed out at will. It's as though Apollo himself is speaking through me.

Id: [0x00230CBC]
So... You're in love.

Id: [0x00230CBD]
Yes, the wedding nears, and there is so much to be done.

Id: [0x00230CBF]
If you need help, I'm here for you.

Id: [0x00230CC0]
Accepting before knowing what I ask of you? That's a rare surprise. I do still need a few things: food for an offering, a ring, and some flowers. If you could bring them to my bride, Iris, she'll make use of them.

Id: [0x00230CC1]
I'm not going to let you put your wedding duties on me.

Id: [0x00230CC9]
Ah, but what are words? Can they be wise? Or are they simply words?

Id: [0x00230CCB]
Once I heard the great Sokrates was on Delos, I raced over to hear his words of wisdom.

Id: [0x00230CD7]
I've known you for a while now, but you've never mentioned Iris.

Id: [0x00230CD8]
There's plenty I haven't mentioned. I'm sure you could say the same to me.

Id: [0x00230CD9]
So what is it about Iris that turns you into... well, what I saw.

Id: [0x00230CDA]
You're not jealous, are you? Don't worry - she's <i>very</i> open. I suppose that's one of my favorite things about her. The... openness.

Id: [0x00230CDB]
How could you<i> not</i> know? You know the island. I thought you had a plan.

Id: [0x00230CDC]
His men are always hanging around that farm... Must have been that pretty farmer. A common misconception!

Id: [0x00230CDD]
<i>Maláka!</i> Markos, sometimes I wonder how you walk around with a brain so small.

Id: [0x00230CDE]
You don't mean that! Come on, think of all the smart things I've done. Remember the Cyclops's eye?

Id: [0x00230CDF]
I destroyed someone's farm. I <i>knew </i>something was off.

Id: [0x00230CE0]
I'll take on the debt and help them rebuild. Nothing else can go wrong!

Id: [0x00230D00]
[&ah]Another mess.

Id: [0x00230D02]
You've known me longer than anyone. If you can't forgive me, Kassandra, who can?

Id: [0x00230D03]
Someone with more patience.

Id: [0x00230D05]
An Athenian ship is supposed to arrive soon, and these waters are full of pirates.

Id: [0x00230D06]
The Athenians can handle them, no?

Id: [0x00230D07]
They can row. They can fight. But both at the same time? My drachmae's on the pirates.

Id: [0x00230D16]
Did you see that new sword the commander just bought?

Id: [0x00230D23]
So... Flowers, a ring, and food. Where can I find Iris?

Id: [0x00230D24]
She should be at the Altar of Love. Aptly named, don't you think? Oh, and don't be too taken by her beauty.

Id: [0x00230D25]
A ring, flowers, and food. That's what my love needs.

Id: [0x00230D26]
It's all done.

Id: [0x00230D27]
Wonderful! So, what did you think about Iris?

Id: [0x00230D2A]
You found a good one. I can see what you like about her.

Id: [0x00230D2B]
I knew you would! Even though nothing could change my mind about her, it's always nice to get confirmation from others.

Id: [0x00230D2C]
You must see something in her that I don't.

Id: [0x00230D2D]
Well that's true. Quite often, too.

Id: [0x00230D2E]
But still, I'm surprised to hear you say that.

Id: [0x00230D31]
You can't marry her. She told me she's using you for her own gain.

Id: [0x00230D32]
Is that so?

Id: [0x00230D33]
It is.

Id: [0x00230D34]
I knew she was special. To think I wasn't able to catch on... I can't wait to marry her.

Id: [0x00230D35]
Uh...

Id: [0x00230D36]
I'm glad you and I were able to work together, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00230D38]
I hope you two are happy. You seem perfect for one another.

Id: [0x00230D39]
We'll be more than happy. Thank you for your help, Kassandra. I hope this isn't the last time we meet.

Id: [0x00230D3C]
As fine a blade as ever I've seen.

Id: [0x00230D3D]
Got it from the new smith, I heard him say.

Id: [0x00230D3E]
[chuckle]Yeah, the smith didn't make it, though. He can knock a dent out all right, but that sword... That's real craftsmanship, that is.

Id: [0x00230D42]
So, how far do I have to travel to find these sacred sites?

Id: [0x00230D43]
I had one of my loyal crew, Anaximander, draw several maps to show you the locations. He's clever with a stylus.

Id: [0x00230D45]
The Spartans are losing a lot of troops to desertion.

Id: [0x00230D46]
That's good news for you, then?

Id: [0x00230D47]
Not necessarily. Rumor has it their commander will offer them better conditions if they return. I can't let the phalanx reform.

Id: [0x00230D58]
Any guards at these holy sites?

Id: [0x00230D5A]
Good enough for now. I'll keep an eye out for the bracelet you want.

Id: [0x00230D64]
A witch has been spreading prophecies that the Spartans will fall.

Id: [0x00230D65]
Do you believe her?

Id: [0x00230D66]
I don't know. But the Spartans did, so they captured her.

Id: [0x00230D67]
That's unfortunate.

Id: [0x00230D68]
Yes, she was really hurting Spartan morale. I hope she escapes soon, if only so she can keep it up.

Id: [0x00230D9C]
Yet right now there's a situation I would love your opinion on.

Id: [0x00230D9E]
Soldiers captured a rebel. He stole from the sanctuary to help finance the rebellion. When guards attempted to apprehend the man, he killed one of them.

Id: [0x00230D9F]
Murder on Delos. They're probably going to kill him.

Id: [0x00230DA0]
Indeed, though it's illegal to end his life here. So he awaits his fate, to be transported to Mykonos.

Id: [0x00230DA1]
Where do I come in?

Id: [0x00230DA2]
Would you say this rebel deserves death? That killing him brings justice?

Id: [0x00230DAF]
What if I free his slaves? If he has no slaves, he can't mistreat them anymore, and you'll be able to treat him without guilt.

Id: [0x00230DB0]
Yes, I can save this man, and you can prevent him from hurting others. Our kindness here will show him the error of his ways - show him a different path to walk. You would do this for me?

Id: [0x00230DBE]
I have so much work to do during planting season.

Id: [0x00230DBF]
You're no farmer.

Id: [0x00230DC0]
Whenever the government changes, I must plant a new crop of friendly politicians. This package of golden seeds should help, if it reaches the right hands.

Id: [0x00230DC5]
Let me guess... Alkibiades sent you.

Id: [0x00230DC6]
He did. How did you know?

Id: [0x00230DC7]
He has a skill for making others do things he doesn't want to. On top of that, he prefers if those people are attractive. He's so predictable. It's what made this whole thing so easy.

Id: [0x00230DCB]
That's the woman Alkibiades is going to marry. I should talk to her.

Id: [0x00230DEA]
So you want me to free the beast.

Id: [0x00230E00]
I've treated his injuries enough to stabilize him, but he isn't out of danger yet...

Id: [0x00230E03]
I've freed the slaves.

Id: [0x00230E04]
I don't know if I can bring myself to complete the treatment.

Id: [0x00230E15]
So you're just going to stand here and watch this man die? You need to do what you do best, and heal him. It's what the gods put you here to do - help people, not judge them.

Id: [0x00230E17]
I've freed his slaves, and his business is finished. Perhaps our kindness will show him there is another path.

Id: [0x00230E19]
If I do nothing, I'll be no better than him. [beat]I'll make sure he recovers.

Id: [0x00230E1A]
When he does, be sure to tell him how his life was in our hands.

Id: [0x00230E1B]
Only the gods have the power to decide life and death. What I do is insignificant compared to their benevolence.

Id: [0x00230E1F]
By the gods, yes. The creature must go free.

Id: [0x00230E2D]
No, I want you to free the beast.

Id: [0x00230E3C]
For one that reeks of <i>civilization</i>.

Id: [0x00230E3D]
Oh, and what does civilization smell like?

Id: [0x00230E3E]
Blood... and fear. Yet, you defeated the beast.

Id: [0x00230E51]
It almost sounds like you're using him. What has been "easy"?

Id: [0x00230E52]
Making him fall in love with me, of course. Please, Alkibiades is <i>not</i> the man you marry for love.

Id: [0x00230E53]
Then why <i>are</i> you marrying him?

Id: [0x00230E54]
Alkibiades has a true chance of ruling one day. Well, he'll be the face, but I'll be the one truly leading. The Aspasia to his Perikles.

Id: [0x00230E56]
I don't care what you're doing with Alkibiades, or why. He asked me to give these to you. So I am.

Id: [0x00230E57]
If I can give you some advice - you'd do well to be like me. Find someone with greater means than yourself. Make them love you. Reap the rewards.

Id: [0x00230E5D]
How can you treat someone like Alkibiades that way?

Id: [0x00230E5E]
Oh, please. If anyone deserves it, it's Alkibiades. Surely you've noticed. The obsession with sex. The lies. The drinking.

Id: [0x00230E5F]
So, lying to him is what he deserves?

Id: [0x00230E60]
Of course. And it's not like he'll get nothing in return. I mean, look at me.

Id: [0x00230E61]
I'm impressed. I didn't think Alkibiades would ever be on the receiving end of something like this.

Id: [0x00230E62]
He's used to being on the receiving end.

Id: [0x00230E63]
Well, you definitely have something in common.

Id: [0x00230E64]
I'll pretend that was a compliment.

Id: [0x00230E65]
And what if I tell Alkibiades all of this?

Id: [0x00230E66]
Why would you? You've seen him. He's happy. And I'll make sure he stays that way. There's nothing wrong with me getting something in return. But it's your choice. Thanks for helping with the wedding.

Id: [0x00230E7B]
What we deserve and what we get are two very different things. The trick, my philosophical friend, is to never get caught.

Id: [0x00230E7E]
He broke a sacred law, one he knew honored the gods.

Id: [0x00230E7F]
So, you're saying he can kill and steal... But stain the earth, and he should have his throat cut?

Id: [0x00230E80]
I am saying nothing. But when we stray from the law, are we not like the animals?

Id: [0x00230E82]
So many injured. So much bloodshed.

Id: [0x00230E88]
The price of war is paid in blood.

Id: [0x00230E8A]
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.

Id: [0x00230E8C]
I think that's what a lot of people tell themselves to make sense of the chaos. [beat]But anyway, soldiers are hoarding supplies I desperately need to heal injured civilians.

Id: [0x00230E92]
Yes. All the Daughters of Artemis must die.

Id: [0x00230E9B]
[&laughs]God forbid you ever have children.

Id: [0x00230E9C]
Ha! You know my opinion on <i>that</i>. Can I go now?

Id: [0x00230E9D]
Of course, of course.

Id: [0x00230E9E]
[&scoff]There always is.

Id: [0x00230E9F]
The rebel is being held north from here in the Hestiatorion. They're shipping him to Mykonos tomorrow.

Id: [0x00230EA1]
Wait. All this just to convince me to save the man?

Id: [0x00230EA2]
Convince? Never. Though I am curious - now that you know where he's held and why, would you save him?

Id: [0x00230EA4]
No, all the Daughters Of Artemis must die.

Id: [0x00230EA8]
No, slay the Daughter of Artemis.

Id: [0x00230EAF]
The Daughter of Artemis must die.

Id: [0x00230EB2]
Still have to pay him a visit.

Id: [0x00230EB3]
[&hmm]Hopefully they haven't sailed to Mykonos to carry out his death sentence.

Id: [0x00230EB5]
My hunting partner - he went out into the forest three sunrises ago, and he hasn't returned.

Id: [0x00230EBB]
I'm sure he's just hunting still.

Id: [0x00230EBD]
The forest is dangerous. If he hasn't come back, he's likely dead.

Id: [0x00230EBF]
A particularly dangerous group of bandits roams these parts. There's a good chance he was taken captive.

Id: [0x00230EC3]
While your attitude could use improvement, you are a capable fighter.

Id: [0x00230EC4]
I <i>am</i> the best.

Id: [0x00230EC5]
You're good enough. Which will have to do.

Id: [0x00230ECC]
I'm impressed with your work.

Id: [0x00230ED0]
So you want me to kill the huntress?

Id: [0x00230EDC]
So you'd like me to wipe out the huntresses?

Id: [0x002310B4]
Hey, over here! Come on!

Id: [0x002310BA]
Welcome to the Olympics! Breathe in. Can you not taste the excitement in the air?

Id: [0x002310BB]
Are you going to be like this the whole time we're here?

Id: [0x002310BC]
By the gods, yes!

Id: [0x002310BD]
I'll try and win quickly, then.

Id: [0x002310BE]
Come now. You must be feeling something.

Id: [0x002310BF]
[laugh]I'm just having fun with you. Who wouldn't be impressed?

Id: [0x002310C0]
It is a place of immortal glory - you can be sure Hera and Zeus will be watching your performance closely.

Id: [0x002310C1]
Oh, no pressure, then.

Id: [0x002310C2]
[laugh]Forget that for the moment, and let's enjoy the sights and see what Olympia has to offer.

Id: [0x002310C9]
Talking in circles may work on others, Sokrates, but not on me.

Id: [0x002310CA]
I don't speak in circles, or any other shape. You answered one of my questions, and that brought another to mind.

Id: [0x002310CB]
And another... And another...

Id: [0x002310CF]
Is that the only role you know? You present yourself one way, but it's as if you fear showing your true self.

Id: [0x002310D0]
I've told you, Sokrates, I'll gladly show you my <i>true</i> self. Just say the word.

Id: [0x002310D1]
My point is proven so easily.

Id: [0x002310DF]
The lid of the offering box.

Id: [0x002310E5]
Someone tossed the box here... but it's empty.

Id: [0x002310EB]
Huh. An offering box is missing.

Id: [0x002310EF]
You didn't like it? I thought you would like it!

Id: [0x002310F2]
Doesn't matter if I liked it. You stole from the gods!

Id: [0x00231102]
Perhaps one of these couples saw something.

Id: [0x00231108]
I wanted to impress you!

Id: [0x0023110C]
Tremble, you fools, for I am the wrath of Apollo!

Id: [0x00231116]
Which one of you idiots stole the bracelet from the shrine?

Id: [0x00231120]
There's the warehouse dock.

Id: [0x00231125]
The warehouse.

Id: [0x0023112A]
The warehouse grounds.

Id: [0x00231134]
The tents. Eretria's[2113965] seen better days.

Id: [0x00231139]
There it is. The shipwreck[2105455]!

Id: [0x00231146]
You dogs! Let me go!

Id: [0x00231147]
You'll never get me back to Mykonos! Kyra will come and kill you all!

Id: [0x00231148]
Crawl back to where you came from, pigs! This is the land of Apollo!

Id: [0x00231154]
What's going on?

Id: [0x00231155]
Trust me, this man needs to die. I gave you a contract to bring him to me. Do not interfere, and I will reward you well.

Id: [0x0023115B]
In my veins flows the blood of champions. Few have stood before me, and fewer have lived.

Id: [0x0023115E]
You fought well, I'll give you that.

Id: [0x00231164]
I am Thalia, of the Daughters of Artemis. Our leader, Daphnae, has been searching for someone... I believe it could be you. Will you meet with her?

Id: [0x00231166]
Thank you, misthios! But you were too gentle with those pigs.

Id: [0x00231167]
Keep your opinion to yourself. You've caused enough trouble. Now follow me.

Id: [0x0023116B]
There will be more. Hurry, follow me.

Id: [0x0023116C]
I saw you. You loved spilling blood on sacred soil, just like me!

Id: [0x0023116D]
I'm nothing like you. Now shut up and follow me before you get us killed.

Id: [0x0023116F]
Thank you, misthios! They were going to kill me. But you killed them first!

Id: [0x00231179]
You said this package isn't from you. Why do you have it, then?

Id: [0x0023117A]
It simply came into my hands, that's all. Diodoros asked for my help, like I'm asking for yours now.

Id: [0x0023117B]
Why can't this Diodoros deliver it himself?

Id: [0x0023117E]
Don't let my new, tranquil life fool you. Markos always gets the upper hand!

Id: [0x00231181]
They haven't skinned my hide yet, so there's still time. Let their silos burn, my friend!

Id: [0x0023119D]
Death to our oppressors. And anyone else who tries to claim the Delos Islands. Delians are free!

Id: [0x0023119E]
More Delians will die if you don't shut up.

Id: [0x0023119F]
Silence is what led to this. I'll scream till my lungs bleed, and all soldiers are dead!

Id: [0x002311A0]
<i>Maláka!</i>

Id: [0x002311A8]
You're a curious one, aren't you? Some questions don't have answers. Sometimes things just... are.

Id: [0x002311A9]
You've traveled a lot - where's your favorite place to go?

Id: [0x002311AA]
Oh, a personal question... interesting.

Id: [0x002311AB]
The world is filled with beautiful places. To pick my favorite would be like picking my favorite hetaera. I could do it, but the answer changes based on my mood.

Id: [0x002311AF]
You have a very loud mouth. You could have gotten us both killed.

Id: [0x002311B1]
Did you regret turning down my package?

Id: [0x002311B2]
Hurry and deliver the package to Bardas.

Id: [0x002311B3]
All right. Who am I giving the package to?

Id: [0x002311B4]
There's a man named Bardas near the Korinthian military fort[2042032]. He's one of their stronger... assets.

Id: [0x002311B5]
And I just tell him it's from you?

Id: [0x002311B7]
No, from Diodoros. Don't forget. Diodoros.

Id: [0x002311BE]
Unheard of! I can't believe my coward soldiers would run at word of a large Athenian army closing in.

Id: [0x002311BF]
I rarely hear of Spartan soldiers deserting.

Id: [0x002311C0]
You've never heard of it. Nobody has. [beat]And it needs to stay that way.

Id: [0x002311C4]
I can barely hunt anything these days. Bandits are scaring off the game. Their leader thought my hunting grounds were a good place to set up a hideout.

Id: [0x002311CD]
I was just starting to miss you. I hope you delivered the package.

Id: [0x002311D0]
You aren't the <i>misthios </i>I sent for. What do you want?

Id: [0x002311D1]
This is for you.

Id: [0x002311D2]
Give it here.

Id: [0x002311D5]
Is this some kind of joke? This is a cast of someone's dick!

Id: [0x002311D6]
What's this engraving? "This is for your wife Thelia, for when she starts to miss me."

Id: [0x002311D7]
Tell me now! Who sent this?

Id: [0x002311E0]
Do you know a man named Diodoros?

Id: [0x002311E1]
Diodoros? He'll pay for this with this life! I'll destroy his men. I'll destroy his ship. He'll regret ever touching Thelia!

Id: [0x002311E4]
You realize <i>I'm</i> not Delian. The Spartans who fought and died for the rebellion are <i>also</i> not Delian.

Id: [0x002311E5]
Athenians want these islands for our wealth. The Spartans want these islands for Sparta. I won't let them have it. We don't need them! We don't want them! Delians should rule Delos alone!

Id: [0x002311E6]
Now if you don't mind, I'm going straight to Kyra. The rebels must leave their caves. The time to attack is now!

Id: [0x002311E9]
A man named Alkibiades gave it to me.

Id: [0x002311EA]
Alkibiades? Just because Perikles took him in and he's friends with important people, he thinks he can do whatever he wants. I won't let him get away with this!

Id: [0x002311EC]
It's from me, Bardas, can't you tell?

Id: [0x002311ED]
Do you think this is a joke? You'll pay for that!

Id: [0x002311F3]
I've seen you save many from a trip down the Styx.

Id: [0x002311F4]
But look at the plague - for all my knowledge and experience, I could do nothing against it. I have to accept that my reach only goes so far. Thank you for your help, my friend.

Id: [0x002311FA]
Why don't you come with me? My crew and I need a good physician. Besides, the best way to see the world is by sea.

Id: [0x002311FB]
Yes, that does sound like a good opportunity. I'm bound to come into contact with all sorts of unusual ailments if I follow you.

Id: [0x002311FD]
I hope you find the answers you're looking for, Hippokrates. May the gods watch over you.

Id: [0x002311FF]
Good luck, Hippokrates. I hope our paths cross again in the future.

Id: [0x00231206]
Bardas threatened to kill Diodoros when I told him. I also wasn't expecting the package to be... well... that.

Id: [0x00231207]
It <i>was</i> a nice surprise, wasn't it? I can make another one for you, too, if you'd like.

Id: [0x00231208]
Another one? You-

Id: [0x00231209]
It was mine, yes. It looked good, didn't it? I needed to get Diodoros out of the way, and now he will be. I impress myself sometimes.

Id: [0x0023120A]
Whatever you say.

Id: [0x0023120B]
Why don't we let our bodies do the talking? Surely you had thoughts of it as well when you saw the cast of me...

Id: [0x0023120D]
I told Bardas that... it came from you.

Id: [0x0023120E]
You did what? I specifically told you to say it was from Diodoros.

Id: [0x00231210]
Now I have to come up with another plan. It took me a long time to make that cast.

Id: [0x00231211]
Wait, so it <i>was </i>yours?

Id: [0x00231212]
Yes, that impressive specimen was mine. I really wish you hadn't told him that. [beat]You can go now. I need to think.

Id: [0x00231217]
A physician will pay me well for bear livers. He says he needs them for medicine.

Id: [0x00231218]
Bear livers? Sounds awful.

Id: [0x00231219]
There's too many bears around here anyway. They'll be hunted by somebody eventually - might as well make medicine out of them.

Id: [0x0023123E]
Are you going to make me beg? Because I'll beg. Spare me from the Cerberus!

Id: [0x0023123F]
Markos...

Id: [0x00231240]
Have I led you down the wrong path? A few times, yes. Many times, maybe. But this is it for me, my friend!

Id: [0x00231244]
I thought I'd make a joke and tell him it was mine, but he didn't laugh.

Id: [0x00231245]
Why would you do that? Bardas is an angry, emotional man. I hoped to get rid of Diodoros, but now you've ruined that.

Id: [0x00231246]
If you wanted to get rid of Diodoros, then that package wasn't from him after all.

Id: [0x00231247]
Of course not. It was a perfect plan, but now I have to come up with something else. Don't think I'll ever make a cast for <i>you</i> now.

Id: [0x00231253]
He would have thrown you and your philosophies into the sea.

Id: [0x00231254]
[&laughs]Perhaps when I was thinner, both in weight, and philosophy. So, tell me, were you able to resolve the situation without bloodshed?

Id: [0x00231255]
What can I say? I was in a good mood.

Id: [0x00231256]
I can't keep you safe if you keep getting into trouble, Markos.

Id: [0x00231258]
What happened to "everybody benefits?" I've never benefitted from helping you.

Id: [0x00231279]
Think back to that sunny day when I found you, Kassandra. That was your day of need, and Markos came to the rescue! Come to <i>my</i> rescue today.

Id: [0x0023127A]
I've paid you back plenty.

Id: [0x0023127B]
That I can't deny. But the Cerberus will come with its dogs and its devotees, and I'll be finished! Protect me, and we'll come out on top.

Id: [0x0023127C]
There's that "we" again...

Id: [0x0023127D]
I'll tell you what. You protect me, and you get Mama's beloved battle axe! She used to be quite the fighter, believe it or not.

Id: [0x00231283]
Those farmers put up a shrine to Demeter... again.

Id: [0x00231284]
What's wrong with Demeter?

Id: [0x00231285]
They do it to dedicate land to her. Next step is clearing it for crops.

Id: [0x0023128D]
Maybe you can reach some kind of agreement? You all need to make a living.

Id: [0x00231290]
If they're threatening your livelihood, you could threaten then back.

Id: [0x00231298]
Yes.

Id: [0x00231299]
I'm not sure approaching you was wise.

Id: [0x0023129B]
It's a pleasure, Sokrates. I can always count on you to give me a devastating headache.

Id: [0x0023129C]
[&laughs]The pleasure is mine, Kassandra. Hope to see you around the symposiums again.

Id: [0x0023129D]
Don't hold your breath.

Id: [0x002312A0]
Please, by all the gods, save me.

Id: [0x002312A4]
I swear by Zeus - if you help me I'll make you rich.

Id: [0x002312A6]
All right. Let's keep you alive.

Id: [0x002312A7]
Oh, I've never heard words more sweet! You'll never get rid of me now.

Id: [0x002312A8]
That's why I do what I do.

Id: [0x002312A9]
And just in time. I hear them approaching!

Id: [0x002312AB]
I'm done, Markos. I've stuck my neck out for you more times than I can count.

Id: [0x002312AE]
I have to do this all on my lonesome?

Id: [0x002312AF]
Good luck. <i>Chaire</i>, Markos.

Id: [0x002312B0]
You're really leaving? Ay! I have to hide!

Id: [0x002312B5]
Hellebore, <i>misthios</i>. Do you have some hellebore?

Id: [0x002312B6]
I use my blade to deal with my foes, not poison. You need hellebore to poison someone?

Id: [0x002312B7]
I'm not a murderer! I'm creating a new training technique.

Id: [0x002312B8]
You need poison for training? I'm confused.

Id: [0x002312B9]
I don't blame you, I'm a pioneer! It's simple, I drink a very small amount of hellebore every day to train my body against its effects.

Id: [0x002312BA]
And now you've run out.

Id: [0x002312BB]
I had a large supply of it. But my house was raided by bandits, and they stole everything. I've tracked them down to this area. I need my daily dose to stay strong...

Id: [0x002312C0]
I'm Kassandra. Some call me the Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x002312C2]
Some know me as the Eagle Bearer, but my friends call me Kassandra.

Id: [0x002312CC]
So you party often?

Id: [0x002312CD]
As often as I can.

Id: [0x002312CE]
I'm not sure how you do it.

Id: [0x002312CF]
Practice, practice, practice. The more I do, the better chance of having a clearer head than those around me.

Id: [0x002312D0]
So you're looking to gain an advantage?

Id: [0x002312D1]
Over my allies? Never. [&gasp]Actually, let's not talk about such things.

Id: [0x002312D7]
I hunted a wolf for a Spartan commander. Seems there's call for them since that general was killed.

Id: [0x002312D8]
The Wolf of Sparta?

Id: [0x002312D9]
That's the one. The commander wanted a necklace of wolf teeth for luck. Can't understand it myself. The bastard's dead, after all.

Id: [0x002312E1]
Like what?

Id: [0x002312E4]
Well, let's see... People forget I'm an orphan - that Perikles isn't my father.

Id: [0x002312E5]
I know what it's like to lose family, too.

Id: [0x002312E6]
Ah. We have that in common. There's more to you than I thought, <i>misthios</i>. [beat]Now, where were we?

Id: [0x002312E8]
I'm not sure we're there just yet. Let's get back to the task at hand.

Id: [0x002312EC]
Quickly! Kill that beast before it finishes me off.

Id: [0x002312F1]
Thank you. Thank you. I owe you my life, brave hero.

Id: [0x002312F6]
I can't walk. My injuries are too severe. Please, take me to a healer.

Id: [0x002312FE]
Come out, come out, Markos!

Id: [0x00231301]
I feel faint. I'm getting dizzy.

Id: [0x00231304]
All right, Markos, this is it. The grand finale!

Id: [0x00231307]
Must be what's left of the hunting party.

Id: [0x00231313]
I need to get him back to Hippokrates before he bleeds out all over me.

Id: [0x00231316]
I was out hunting with my brother when a group of bandits attacked us. I got away, but he didn't.

Id: [0x00231317]
Why don't you go after him?

Id: [0x00231318]
There's too many of them. And they have my brother locked up in a cage. If they see me coming, they might hurt him.

Id: [0x0023131D]
We did it, my friend! I'd say I was invincible, but I don't want to jinx myself.

Id: [0x0023131E]
Yes, <i>that's </i>why you're alive.

Id: [0x0023131F]
I joke, I joke. I owe you everything, Kassandra! For this, you get a lifetime supply of wine, and my friendship. Lucky you! [beat]Oh, and Mama's axe.

Id: [0x00231321]
Life will now be simple. All thanks to you. It's always thanks to you!

Id: [0x00231322]
A less dramatic life is just what you need, Markos.

Id: [0x00231327]
Now, back to what's important. My wine, and my Mama!

Id: [0x00231333]
There's the camp. I need to be careful... The slaves won't be unguarded.

Id: [0x00231337]
Thank you for all your help, my friend.

Id: [0x00231341]
You did your duty, Hippokrates. I did mine.

Id: [0x00231349]
I need to free these slaves.

Id: [0x0023134D]
They're locked in cages.

Id: [0x0023134F]
Not much food around lately. Since the plague, there's not enough farmers, and too many desperate hunters. I'm going to try for fish.

Id: [0x00231350]
Sounds sensible.

Id: [0x00231351]
There's sharks in these waters, though. I'm not equipped for those. But you seem well-armed.

Id: [0x00231355]
I'm so thirsty.

Id: [0x0023135F]
The gods have forsaken me.

Id: [0x00231364]
Please, set us free.

Id: [0x00231368]
I can't escape... I'm injured. [beat]They left me in here to die.

Id: [0x0023136B]
Depends what you've done.

Id: [0x0023136C]
Don't know if anyone told you, but it's illegal to die on this gods-forsaken island.

Id: [0x0023136D]
So I've been told.

Id: [0x0023136E]
I need to get this deer hide to a farmer who lives nearby. It's an apology gift... I shot their pigs.

Id: [0x0023136F]
Why did you shoot their pigs?

Id: [0x00231370]
They were standing behind the deer I was aiming at. They squealed horribly.

Id: [0x00231374]
Please, I won't make it far. You have to help me get out of here.

Id: [0x00231378]
Thank you for freeing us. That beast Galeos has worked all of us to the brink of death. Now I can return home to my family.

Id: [0x00231391]
That looks like hemlock.

Id: [0x00231398]
I need to find the hemlock.

Id: [0x00231422]
That estate looks like where I need to be. Now to get in and steal enough valuables.

Id: [0x00231426]
This looks valuable. I'll take it.

Id: [0x0023142A]
They'll definitely miss this.

Id: [0x0023142E]
They need better security. [beat]Not that it would have stopped me.

Id: [0x00231432]
That should be everything worth taking.

Id: [0x0023143D]
Someone's been stealing my pelts. If it happens again, I won't be able to keep my promises to merchants.

Id: [0x0023143E]
Why haven't you stopped the thief yourself?

Id: [0x0023143F]
It's not like I have a lot of extra time to chase a thief that runs away runs away before I can catch more than a glance. I'm already behind on my deliveries.

Id: [0x0023144C]
There's a merchant who's been cheating us. Underpaying for good pelts and meat.

Id: [0x0023144D]
Why don't you and some other hunters teach him a lesson?

Id: [0x0023144E]
We'd like to. But lately he's been staying on his boat, out of range of our arrows and spears. Only comes to shore to broker more bad deals...

Id: [0x0023145A]
Talk.

Id: [0x0023145F]
Times are tough. I haven't sold much meat lately.

Id: [0x00231460]
But there's a battle going on. Don't the soldiers need food?

Id: [0x00231461]
They brought their own supplies and hunt on their own. It would be a shame if something was to happen to them. Or to all the meaty beasts that lurk nearby.

Id: [0x0023149B]
That must be the farmer. He's locked up.

Id: [0x002314A5]
Chios city. The merchant said the bears are north of here.

Id: [0x002314B8]
The Hunted Forest of Artemis. The bears will be in this region.

Id: [0x002314BD]
There's a bear.

Id: [0x002314C2]
That must be the shrine[2446532] the wife mentioned.

Id: [0x002314C7]
Those must be the mountains where the hunters tracked the wolf to.

Id: [0x002314CC]
That must be the hut of the favorite daughter.

Id: [0x002314D1]
That must be the cave[2106094] where the boots are.

Id: [0x002314D6]
The outpost camp[2392896].

Id: [0x002314DB]
This must be the mountain where the hellebore grows.

Id: [0x002314E0]
This mountain must be where the cave[2164328] is.

Id: [0x002314E5]
Shark Bay. The shipwreck should be here.

Id: [0x002314EA]
The Slave Market Agapios mentioned. He must be around here somewhere...

Id: [0x002314F0]
That must be the woman's workshop.

Id: [0x002314F5]
The logging camp.

Id: [0x002314FE]
The camp.

Id: [0x00231504]
There's Fisherman's Bay.

Id: [0x00231509]
That must be Stormfall Bay.

Id: [0x0023150E]
The Forest of Tears.

Id: [0x00231513]
The farm[2392900].

Id: [0x00231518]
The supply huts.

Id: [0x0023151D]
That must be Vrisa Fort.

Id: [0x00231524]
The Leader House.

Id: [0x00231527]
Depends. What ails you, friend? Sore throat? Slow-healing wounds? Itchy bits on parts unmentionable?

Id: [0x00231545]
This is the War Torn Bay region.

Id: [0x0023154A]
This the region of the Ancient Pearl.

Id: [0x0023154F]
The Petrified Valley region.

Id: [0x00231554]
The region of the Ancient Pearl.

Id: [0x0023155A]
There's the temple[2392624] on the hill.

Id: [0x00231588]
I told you! There's tons of drachmae to be made digging caves!

Id: [0x002315A3]
I'll get the Leader's armor and a Minotaur Axe.

Id: [0x002315B4]
Ah, the <i>misthios</i> arrives. Then we can begin.

Id: [0x002315B8]
Now come! There's so much more to see!

Id: [0x002315B9]
I'll buy your elixir.

Id: [0x002315BA]
Good hustle, kid.

Id: [0x002315BD]
Hey!

Id: [0x002315BE]
Yeah?

Id: [0x002315BF]
What's it like being a <i>misthios?</i>

Id: [0x002315C0]
[beat]Could be worse.

Id: [0x002315C5]
Ah, more fresh blood.

Id: [0x002315C6]
By the look of these warriors, this Battle of One Hundred Hands is going to be one for the ages. Indeed, I think it will have people talking for years.

Id: [0x002315C7]
Your gear could be the difference between victory or death. Don't forget to visit Gernadios for the best weapons and armor.

Id: [0x002315C9]
Thanks, Drakios.

Id: [0x002315CA]
Prepare, warriors. The Battle will commence soon.

Id: [0x002315D3]
You wouldn't be talking about the giant bear down by the beach, would you?

Id: [0x002315D4]
You saw the beast, and you still live?

Id: [0x002315D5]
That bear wasn't from this world. The vicious pet of some angry god. I sent him back to his owner.

Id: [0x002315D6]
I don't know who you are, warrior, but take this. You've earned it.

Id: [0x002315D8]
Now go, let me bleed in peace.

Id: [0x002315DE]
A shipwreck. Might explain how that bear got to Delos.

Id: [0x002315E3]
This cage is in splinters. Good news for the bear... Bad for the crew.

Id: [0x002315E8]
That beast escaped from some god's nightmare!

Id: [0x002315ED]
A corpse. This one's had his guts ripped out - a feast for the birds.

Id: [0x002315F3]
There's nothing left to find here. I should return to the woman.

Id: [0x002315F8]
[&ah][breathing heavy]You were a mighty beast. But you did not belong here.

Id: [0x002315FD]
You won't make a meal of me!

Id: [0x00231608]
Sometimes we need to move on from the past, like I did from Kephallonia. You have a chance to make a new life - use it.

Id: [0x00231623]
This used to be a nice village, but now it's just a nest of anarchy and crime.

Id: [0x00231AA7]
I'm supposed to bring herbs to a student of Hippokrates, but the way there is too dangerous.

Id: [0x00231AA8]
Hippokrates is a friend of mine, maybe I can help.

Id: [0x00231AA9]
May Apollo the healer bless you. The doctor's not far from here, but there's a pack of wolves roaming around.

Id: [0x00232864]
I'm Daphnae, leader of the Daughters of Artemis. I have a task for you, if you are willing... and able.

Id: [0x00232868]
That <i>can't </i>be who I think it is.

Id: [0x00232894]
You want me to kill a pig?

Id: [0x00232895]
This is no ordinary boar. Let's see if you're worthy of my challenge. Kill it, and bring me the pelt.

Id: [0x00232896]
I'll be waiting... with your reward.

Id: [0x002328AE]
Fine.

Id: [0x002328B4]
I see the resemblance.

Id: [0x002328B5]
We come from a sturdy stock, she and I.

Id: [0x002328B6]
Funny. I remember you telling me your mother died a long time ago.

Id: [0x002328BD]
But it was for the freedom of his people, which is right.

Id: [0x002328BE]
He killed a man.

Id: [0x002328BF]
To save his own life.

Id: [0x002328D3]
You <i>do </i>realize the sun is out, right?

Id: [0x002328D4]
Yes, what about it?

Id: [0x002328D5]
Starting a bit early, aren't you?

Id: [0x002328D6]
Starting? No, no. This is ending in the most spectacular fashion.

Id: [0x002328DA]
I am, but he's dead.

Id: [0x002328DB]
That's too bad. The gods must have willed it.

Id: [0x002328DC]
That's not the answer I was expecting.

Id: [0x002328DD]
Let's not dwell on such things. One less politician won't bring down the walls of Athens.

Id: [0x002328F5]
We Spartans stand together. So here I am.

Id: [0x002328F6]
Yes. Spartan blood matters most.

Id: [0x002329B4]
You fought well in battle, misthios.

Id: [0x002329B6]
I'll get you your seals.

Id: [0x002329BC]
Podarkes is dead because of you. We owe you that.

Id: [0x002329BD]
What do you think of the Spartans?

Id: [0x002329BE]
I know what I have to do.

Id: [0x002329C3]
Thaletas... He's...

Id: [0x002329C7]
Find the man who did this.

Id: [0x002329CD]
Simple enough. Any you can find will help.

Id: [0x002329CF]
By the gods, yes. Any will help.

Id: [0x002329D1]
Yes, I'll take any you can find.

Id: [0x002329D3]
Yes, any you can bring me will help.

Id: [0x002329DD]
Must have been hemlock.

Id: [0x002329E1]
My general is dead.

Id: [0x002329E6]
That one. He did this! He's getting away.

Id: [0x002329E7]
Do you have the seals for me?

Id: [0x002329EB]
In fact, I want you to bring me some.

Id: [0x00232A06]
Leave me with Thaletas.

Id: [0x00232A0A]
Is that lunatic dead? Did you kill him?

Id: [0x00232A15]
He's dead.

Id: [0x00232A16]
What is left for the gods to take from me? When will they finally be satisfied?

Id: [0x00232A17]
Kyra...

Id: [0x00232A18]
Go. Leave me with Thaletas.

Id: [0x00232A1A]
Thaletas is gone. No amount of killing will bring him back.

Id: [0x00232A1C]
I killed him with my bare hands.

Id: [0x00232A1D]
I...

Id: [0x00232A1E]
Get off my island.

Id: [0x00232A20]
Liar! Liar... where's the blood? Your hands are clean.

Id: [0x00232A22]
These beasts are creatures, like any other. The world is full of mysteries, but not everything unexplained is ordained by the gods.

Id: [0x00232A23]
With each pelt you return, I will grant you a boon from Artemis. If you are able to slay all the beasts - well, let's say your relationship with the Daughters of Artemis will be forever changed...

Id: [0x00232A3D]
You want me to find some for you?

Id: [0x00232A3F]
You want me to get them.

Id: [0x00232A41]
So the plan is for me to get them.

Id: [0x00232A43]
And you want me to get them for you?

Id: [0x00232A4F]
You showed that lunatic mercy? He killed the future of this island, <i>misthios</i>. I will find him myself, and rip him limb from limb.

Id: [0x00232A51]
As for you... [beat]get off my island.

Id: [0x00232A5B]
We know where he lives. I say we knock down his door and run our spears through his face.

Id: [0x00232A5C]
That's a terrible plan!

Id: [0x00232A5F]
The Spartan phalanx is impenetrable in a ground assault.

Id: [0x00232A60]
Not when there's only twelve of you! You think with your heart - that's what I like about you. But you're a general to those men now. You need to think with your head.

Id: [0x00232A61]
All you do is hide in caves and lurk in shadows. We didn't come here to hide. We came here to fight.

Id: [0x00232A62]
And we will! But right now we're outnumbered. We must be strategic.

Id: [0x00232A65]
Kassandra, what do you think we should do?

Id: [0x00232A6C]
Kyra's right. Taking them head on would be suicide.

Id: [0x00232A71]
Sailing here was suicide. Right now, my men are on the beach. That's where I'll be.

Id: [0x00232A73]
Thaletas, don't.

Id: [0x00232A75]
If you decide you actually want to win this rebellion, come find me.

Id: [0x00232A78]
[&groan]Spartans.

Id: [0x00232A79]
Don't mind him. He'll be fine after he kicks something.

Id: [0x00232A7A]
But I'm glad you agree with me, Kassandra. Meet me at the Temple of Artemis. There we can discuss how to take down Podarkes.

Id: [0x00232A7C]
I like the way the Spartan thinks.

Id: [0x00232A80]
But we don't have enough swords to fight them head on.

Id: [0x00232A81]
What do you suggest?

Id: [0x00232A82]
When I arrived I saw Spartan ships. Can we get a message to them?

Id: [0x00232A83]
Not while the Athenian navy surrounds these islands.

Id: [0x00232A84]
Hmm. We need those reinforcements.

Id: [0x00232A88]
I never should have trusted you.

Id: [0x00232A8F]
We should leave.

Id: [0x00232AA1]
Agreed. Tell the crew to prepare the ship.

Id: [0x00232AA3]
We will, but not yet.

Id: [0x00232AAE]
Why?! I set you free.

Id: [0x00232AB0]
Podarkes is dead, but we are never free. The Spartans are no better than the Athenians in this war.

Id: [0x00232AB5]
I let you go once. I won't make that mistake again.

Id: [0x00232AB7]
Thaletas isn't... <i>wasn't</i> like other Spartans. He cared about these islands, and the people on them.

Id: [0x00232AB8]
Are you blind? He wanted power and control, just like Podarkes. I'm not going to let my son grow up to be a slave to Lakonian kings. <i>Misthios</i>, please... do you have children?

Id: [0x00232ABD]
Kyra, wait.

Id: [0x00232ABF]
While the two of you compare swords, I'll be at the Temple of Artemis making an actual plan.

Id: [0x00232AC1]
She has fight. I like it.

Id: [0x00232AC2]
I'm going back to my camp and my men. Meet me and we'll discuss reinforcements.

Id: [0x00232AC3]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00232AC4]
I got the two of you here to actually help the rebellion, not to send more people to their deaths.

Id: [0x00232ACA]
I was a teacher... before the war, I mean. I loved children. I thought I was making this world a better place for them, and for my own. If you ever start a family, you'll understand: you never stop fighting for the ones you love.

Id: [0x00232ACC]
No. Raising a family in my line of work is… [&breath]difficult.

Id: [0x00232AD0]
I should probably not climb on this.

Id: [0x00232AD4]
<i>Maláka</i>![3x echoes]

Id: [0x00232AD9]
Sami. I wonder if we'll be able to leave without getting into a brawl. Who am I kidding? This place never changes.

Id: [0x00232ADD]
By the gods. What's happened here?

Id: [0x00232AE1]
By Zeus, the Cyclops doesn't mess around.

Id: [0x00232AE5]
All the years I lived on Kephallonia... I never realized the mighty Odysseus's palace was here.

Id: [0x00232AE8]
Some day, if the gods will it, I would love to have children of my own.

Id: [0x00232AED]
Have you changed your mind? Will you kill the Spartan commanders for me?

Id: [0x00232AF4]
Misthios! Over here!

Id: [0x00232B00]
Neither god nor mortal has stopped me so far from achieving my destiny.

Id: [0x00232B07]
These flowers should be good enough for the wedding.

Id: [0x00232B0C]
Hopefully this jewelry is up to Alkibiades's standards.

Id: [0x00232B11]
I think this will be a nice enough offering.

Id: [0x00232B14]
Why do you need these seals?

Id: [0x00232B48]
Find your family and get them out of here.

Id: [0x00232B49]
Maybe you do understand. Tell the rebels when you see them - Delians will never stop fighting until our islands are free and our children are safe.

Id: [0x00232B4F]
What it's worth? What's a curse from the gods worth?!

Id: [0x00232B50]
Don't be a superstitious donkey! That bracelet was priceless!

Id: [0x00232B51]
Hey.

Id: [0x00232B52]
All you care about is money! What about how I feel?

Id: [0x00232B53]
Do you have any idea how much it was worth?

Id: [0x00232B6B]
Well that got the blood pumping. I should talk to this Spartan.

Id: [0x00232B78]
Sokrates! You looking to join our crew?

Id: [0x00232B92]
I've just come to see you off. I sail on a merchant ship in the morning.

Id: [0x00232B93]
May Poseidon calm the waves.

Id: [0x00232B94]
Barnabas - is the Adrestia ready to sail?

Id: [0x00232B96]
Sokrates! The rebels are hunting Athenians. What are you doing here?

Id: [0x00232B97]
I came to teach, as I always do. But don't worry: I sail on a merchant ship set for Attika in the morning.

Id: [0x00232B98]
Wise, as always. Thanks for coming to see us off.

Id: [0x00232B99]
Speaking of being off - Barnabas, are we ready to sail?

Id: [0x00232B9C]
How are your supplies?

Id: [0x00232B9D]
Podarkes's men have set up strongholds across the islands. They're blocking trade routes and stealing our food.

Id: [0x00232B9E]
And weapons?

Id: [0x00232B9F]
[&breath]Our blades are old. Some of us don't even have armor. Meanwhile, the Athenians have smiths working day and night.

Id: [0x00232BA0]
Those soldiers on the beach were armed to the teeth.

Id: [0x00232BA1]
Thaletas, how many Spartans have come to fight?

Id: [0x00232BA2]
My ship arrived with a full crew. Only twelve made it to shore.

Id: [0x00232BA3]
You think this is hopeless, don't you?

Id: [0x00232BA4]
I doesn't matter what I think. What matters is what we do.

Id: [0x00232BA8]
The ship is ready, though the crew are still shaken after seeing Thaletas poisoned.

Id: [0x00232BAB]
The crew are in fine spirits... If a little hungover. But the ship is ready.

Id: [0x00232BAE]
So this is what war looks like. Not what the stories make it out to be.

Id: [0x00232BB1]
The smell of spring is in the air. Reminds me of Sparta...

Id: [0x00232BB5]
Megaris, the city of pigs.

Id: [0x00232BBA]
Though, if I may... You shouldn't second guess your choice to save the poisoner the first time, or the second.

Id: [0x00232BC9]
I remember <i>mater's</i> stories of Kirrha and the sacred wars. I wonder if she ever came here.

Id: [0x00232BCD]
I've never seen so many olive trees.

Id: [0x00232BD1]
Who would have imagined the war would reach Lalalia?

Id: [0x00232BD5]
The Sanctuary of Delphi. The gods themselves watch over this land.

Id: [0x00232BD9]
The mud men of Prometheus! If only Athena could breathe life into them.

Id: [0x00232BDD]
I think it's unwise for man to revere Tityos. He angered Zeus and the other gods, after all.

Id: [0x00232BDF]
Good. I only wish we weren't leaving Kyra and Thaletas alone to rebuild what's been destroyed by the rebellion.

Id: [0x00232BE0]
[&breath]If only we weren't leaving the people of Delos alone, without Kyra or Thaletas, to rebuild what they lost to the rebellion.

Id: [0x00232BE1]
Good. Sokrates is next, then Thaletas to Sparta. I only wish we weren't leaving the people of Delos alone to rebuild everything they've lost to the rebellion.

Id: [0x00232BE2]
Good. [beat]I only wish we weren't leaving Kyra alone to rebuild her home.

Id: [0x00232BE5]
All my life I've heard stories of Leonidas. I can't believe I'm finally seeing where history was made.

Id: [0x00232BE9]
Is that a door? I've never seen anything like it before.

Id: [0x00232BEB]
Villagers are avoiding a road not far from here. Too many headed that way have disappeared.

Id: [0x00232BEC]
What do you think is going on?

Id: [0x00232BED]
Strange noises are heard down that path. Could be wolves. [beat]There's also rumors about Followers practicing their dark arts nearby.

Id: [0x00232BEE]
Why haven't you investigated?

Id: [0x00232BEF]
I can't leave my post. If the disappearances aren't bad enough, raiders have been terrorizing the village.

Id: [0x00232BF1]
That choice cost Thaletas his life... By poison, no less. A coward's death.

Id: [0x00232BF2]
Did he not die winning Delos for Sparta? That's how he'll be known when he crosses the Styx to the Elysian Fields.

Id: [0x00232BFA]
Kassandra! I'm glad you came.

Id: [0x00232BFB]
Are you?

Id: [0x00232BFC]
I lost my temper in the cave. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00232BFE]
First you throw a knife at me, then you storm out. I'm starting to take it personally.

Id: [0x00232BFF]
[&laughs]I know, I know. I feel terrible. You came all this way, and I've been nothing but cruel.

Id: [0x00232C02]
Though... you shouldn't second guess your choice to save the poisoner the first time. He found justice in the end.

Id: [0x00232C09]
Are any of us truly alone who have our friends and allies beside us?

Id: [0x00232C13]
Exactly. Do you remember what you told me when you first set foot on these sands?

Id: [0x00232C27]
That we were here to finish a job.

Id: [0x00232C29]
I said we were here to kill Podarkes.

Id: [0x00232C2B]
I said we came here to help people.

Id: [0x00232C2C]
That's what we set out to do... And that's precisely what you did. They don't call you the Mighty <i>Misthios</i> for nothing.

Id: [0x00232C2D]
Ha! Who calls me that?

Id: [0x00232C2E]
He does.

Id: [0x00232C2F]
Now then! It's time we give the crew some orders. Where do we sail to next?

Id: [0x00232C36]
Mount Pentelikos holds the purest marble in the Greek world. I heard they built the Parthenon with it!

Id: [0x00232C3A]
Eleusis! What great mysteries do you hide from us?

Id: [0x00232C3E]
Look at all that silver! So this is how Athens got so rich.

Id: [0x00232C42]
The famous Akropolis. A testament to humankind's skill and craftsmanship.

Id: [0x00232C46]
So many boats, so many people! There must be enough food here to feed Kephallonia for a year.

Id: [0x00232C4A]
The gates are shut, no trade can come or go, and an army of Spartans waits for its prey.

Id: [0x00232C4E]
Pots, pots, and more pots.

Id: [0x00232C52]
These statues are incredible! The sculptors truly are masters of their craft.

Id: [0x00232C56]
Zeus will grow angry if they don't hurry up and finish this temple!

Id: [0x00232C5A]
Goods from all over the Greek world! You wouldn't think the city was besieged by an army of Spartans.

Id: [0x00232C5E]
No other beaches rival those of Marathon.

Id: [0x00232C65]
Kassandra! I'm glad you came.

Id: [0x00232C6A]
You're back! I overheard fishermen telling tales of the Adrestia cutting through the sea.

Id: [0x00232C6E]
Can't wait to hear what Sokrates has to say about this.

Id: [0x00232C73]
That's the spirit, Barnabas!

Id: [0x00232C79]
This place is well guarded. Need to be careful.

Id: [0x00232C7E]
Guards! Kill her!

Id: [0x00232C84]
You will die for standing against us, <i>child!</i>

Id: [0x00232C89]
That was for my family, <i>maláka</i>.

Id: [0x00232C99]
What?

Id: [0x00232CA8]
Good thinking. Let's move.

Id: [0x00232CAA]
You just want me all to yourself don't you?[&hmm] Let's get going then.

Id: [0x00232CAF]
Guards everywhere. I need to be careful.

Id: [0x00232CB4]
The chest should be around here somewhere.

Id: [0x00232CB9]
Done! Kyra's going to want to see this.

Id: [0x00232CBE]
Guards protect the island's treasury in one location. If we find it and steal it, the soldiers go unpaid, unfed, and unarmed. Podarkes will finally be vulnerable.

Id: [0x00232CC3]
I'll go back to the hideout. But if you keep this up, Podarkes is as good as dead. I may finally know peace.

Id: [0x00232CC7]
I don't think I've ever really said thank you for coming here. You've given us hope.

Id: [0x00232CCA]
The people will be celebrating their freedom thanks to you.

Id: [0x00232EE1]
Minotaur slaying isn't for everyone. Even if you go home without the beast's head, there <i>will</i> be another way to save your village.

Id: [0x00232EE2]
You're right! All I have to do is... lie to everyone!

Id: [0x00232F08]
An axe that looks like you've looted it from the corpse of a Minotaur... Is there a merchant for that in Pephka?

Id: [0x00232F0A]
You mentioned the... "shiniest" armor was the Pephkan Leader's. Where does he keep it?

Id: [0x00232F2B]
But Zakros is well defended. How should we proceed?

Id: [0x00232F3F]
Oh, and one more thing!

Id: [0x00232F41]
No more masks.

Id: [0x00232F45]
Quite the compliment.

Id: [0x00232F4C]
Well, you weren't the first, and you won't be the last.

Id: [0x00232F4E]
Podarkes.

Id: [0x00232F4F]
That man's been hunting me my whole life.

Id: [0x00232F51]
I'm glad you didn't throw another blade at me.

Id: [0x00232F52]
[&laughs]I know, I know. You came all this way, and I was cruel to you.

Id: [0x00232F54]
Delians are kind people. At least we were. Before... him.

Id: [0x00232F66]
Podarkes, and others like him, want me and my family dead.

Id: [0x00232F68]
He executed my family when I was very little. I survived on the streets. Was raised by hunters, rogue warriors, and mercenaries like you. They are my family now.

Id: [0x00232F6A]
And one day I will fire an arrow into his black heart - one for every Delian family he's destroyed.

Id: [0x00232F6E]
Then why have you let him live this long?

Id: [0x00232F72]
To help me get close enough to fire an arrow into Podarkes's black heart.

Id: [0x00232F78]
Whatever you're after, you're too late. They're all gone... dead or mad.

Id: [0x00232F7B]
I don't understand. Who did this to you?

Id: [0x00232F7C]
I don't understand it myself. My brethren and I were drawn to this place, but madness took over. We fought over the artifact. One of them grabbed it and ran.

Id: [0x00232F7D]
Grabbed the stele?

Id: [0x00232F83]
Perhaps before this is over, you will have a different opinion.

Id: [0x00232F86]
[&hmm]We will see.

Id: [0x00232FBA]
Let him live? Let him <i>live</i>? I've been trying to kill him since I was old enough to draw a bow! But that coward hides behind endless shields, and this the closest I can get without people dying.

Id: [0x00232FBB]
This is why I sent for you.

Id: [0x00232FBE]
I want you to prove your worth in the eyes of Artemis, and hunt these creatures.

Id: [0x00232FBF]
I don't need to prove my worth to anyone. Just tell me what's the reward?

Id: [0x00232FC0]
What exactly do you want me to do?

Id: [0x00232FD9]
Guards! Guards!

Id: [0x00232FDB]
I'll go to Delos, find their stockpiles, and destroy them.

Id: [0x00232FDE]
[&laughs]In the ruins[2347407] on Delos? It's not much of a stockpile any more.

Id: [0x00232FDF]
What? Why?

Id: [0x00232FE0]
I've already been there.

Id: [0x00232FE3]
I'm fine, but nature can be cruel. We were attacked by animals, and he was mauled to death.

Id: [0x00232FE4]
I see. Well, plans change sometimes.

Id: [0x00232FE5]
You seem pretty accepting of this.

Id: [0x00232FE6]
What else can I do? We should both forget this ever happened. [beat]Pretend you never even saw the man.

Id: [0x00232FEC]
Kassandra! You've returned in one piece!

Id: [0x00232FF4]
That should do it. Kyra will want to hear about this.

Id: [0x00232FF8]
Every time we talk, it seems like you're about to sleep with someone... Or you want to... <i>Or</i> you've just finished. Is this woman the most recent one?

Id: [0x00232FF9]
Who said I slept with her?

Id: [0x00232FFA]
It was a safe guess. How do you find time for anything else?

Id: [0x00232FFB]
Determination, mostly.

Id: [0x00232FFD]
There's a closeness you can only feel with someone in those moments. Who wouldn't crave that?

Id: [0x00233002]
The Kynthos Ruins. This is where I'll find Podarkes's weapons and supplies.

Id: [0x00233046]
Is this really where he lives?

Id: [0x0023304C]
How will I recognize the creatures?

Id: [0x0023304E]
Oh, you'll know.

Id: [0x00233054]
If you know something, spit it out.

Id: [0x00233114]
Who ever thought carrying boats across land was a good idea?

Id: [0x00233117]
So this is where Jason left the Argo.

Id: [0x0023311B]
Ah, Sisyphos. You should have left Thanatos to it.

Id: [0x0023311F]
Korinth, the city of pots, prostitutes, and not much else.

Id: [0x00233123]
Poseidon, god of the ocean. Thank you for watching over the Adrestia.

Id: [0x00233127]
People come here to worship Aphrodite, but the view is the real beauty.

Id: [0x0023312B]
Beware the Gorgon stare. I wonder how the sculptor captured the detail so perfectly?

Id: [0x0023312F]
The Kingdom of Agamemnon and Perseus. I need to be on my guard.

Id: [0x00233133]
The ruins of Mycenae. Perseus himself lived there once.

Id: [0x00233137]
The mighty Tiryns. Built by the cyclopes, or so the legend goes.

Id: [0x0023313B]
The Sanctuary of Asklepios, god of medicine. I'd rather trust a physician than a god to heal me.

Id: [0x0023313F]
So this is where the Cercopes hid the olive wood club of Herakles.

Id: [0x00233143]
These bronze statues could rival even Phidias's finest work.

Id: [0x0023319A]
I'm glad we aren't going by sea.

Id: [0x0023319F]
Alkibiades told me about you. He said you're blessed by the gods.

Id: [0x002331A4]
It's nice of you to help someone you don't know at all.

Id: [0x002331BA]
When battles were happening here, troops were paying very well for medical supplies.

Id: [0x002331C0]
You found a need and provided for it. Good for you.

Id: [0x002331C1]
The Fates smiled on me, for a while. But then they laughed and sent bandits to steal my wares and drachmae.

Id: [0x002331C3]
Crows do well when there are bodies around, I suppose.

Id: [0x002331C4]
Crows? Please. The only crows here are those bandits who robbed me on my way to make a sale.

Id: [0x002331D5]
By the gods! Podarkes is Kyra's <i>pater</i>!

Id: [0x002331D6]
Very wise, <i>misthios.</i> Very wise indeed!

Id: [0x002331D7]
Kyra needs to know.

Id: [0x002331D8]
She'll never believe you. Never. Her whole life, she hunts the man who sent Athenians to kill her <i>mater</i> in front of her terrified eyes. [beat]But the gods spared little Kyra. She escaped.

Id: [0x002331DF]
This can't be.

Id: [0x002331E0]
Kyra, I'm sorry.

Id: [0x002331E1]
He took everything from me.

Id: [0x002331E2]
A group of Spartan deserters just passed through. They were feverish, probably contagious. I tried to help them, but they wouldn't stop.

Id: [0x002331E3]
They sound like fools. But then again, they are deserters.

Id: [0x002331E4]
I made up some <i>hypereikon</i> extract to treat them. But it may already be too late.

Id: [0x002331E5]
Too late?

Id: [0x002331E6]
If they see reason and take the medicine in time, they might live.

Id: [0x002331E7]
But if they don't, they're in for agonizing deaths.

Id: [0x002331E8]
Yes. Them and anyone in the next town where they take leave.

Id: [0x002331EB]
I trusted you, Kassandra. And you disgraced me in front of my troops. Leave! I can't look at you right now.

Id: [0x002331F5]
This battle has gone on far too long and claimed too many victims.

Id: [0x002331FB]
The Spartans and Athenians won't stop fighting until one side is destroyed.

Id: [0x00233200]
Both the Spartans and Athenians would be better off if they'd stop fighting.

Id: [0x00233202]
You're probably right. But I have orders for medicine from both commanders. So at least they care for their troops.

Id: [0x00233204]
That's wonderful! And, did you make Podarkes feel our sting?

Id: [0x00233205]
Podarkes's guards will have to fight with their fists and on empty stomachs from now on.

Id: [0x00233206]
Excellent!

Id: [0x00233221]
I have a theory about jellyfish venom. Mixed with certain herbs, it might make a very effective medicine.

Id: [0x00233222]
Medicine for what?

Id: [0x00233223]
I'm not sure yet, that's why I need to gather jellyfish. And then test the medicine on a goat.

Id: [0x00233224]
Then I wish you luck... I think?

Id: [0x00233225]
I have two problems. One, there are sharks in the water with the jellyfish. And two, goats run away from me. I have no idea why.

Id: [0x00233235]
People keep asking me for remedies... I had a request from a politician with a toothache, and a musician with rheumatism.

Id: [0x00233236]
Sounds like you're busy.

Id: [0x00233237]
Yes, but luckily both conditions can be helped with sage oil.

Id: [0x00233246]
Seems like a good place for a hideout.

Id: [0x0023324B]
A pirate crew is using scorpion venom to poison their weapons.

Id: [0x00233251]
That's one way to make an impression. Effective and hard to forget.

Id: [0x00233252]
It's also a terribly painful way to die. We need to stop this.

Id: [0x00233254]
That's a horrible thing to do, even by pirate standards.

Id: [0x00233255]
Yes, and we must stop it.

Id: [0x00233257]
We? What are you doing about it?

Id: [0x00233258]
I made up a batch of asphodel flower tincture to treat the wounds of the pirates' victims. But I suppose it might be better to stop the poisoners themselves.

Id: [0x0023328E]
When I first arrived, I heard rumors of a legendary axe kept in Fort Lato. That's where you'll find what I need.

Id: [0x0023328F]
What's so special about this axe?

Id: [0x00233290]
They say Theseus touched it. <i>Twice.</i>

Id: [0x00233291]
I'm sure Theseus handled many axes in his time.

Id: [0x00233292]
Well, yes. [long beat]But he touched this one <i>twice. </i>Now THAT'S the sort of axe you'd expect a Minotaur to wield!

Id: [0x002332A0]
Somewhere safe. Somewhere little street kids couldn't steal it. His house is well guarded - I'd look there.

Id: [0x00233398]
You saved me.

Id: [0x0023339A]
Well -

Id: [0x002333BC]
What can you tell me about the man behind The Dagger?

Id: [0x002333BD]
Only his reputation is known - cruel, driven by greed... A living noose around the neck of Euboea. If we can't find out who he is and stop him, our fate is that of Eretria's: total ruin.

Id: [0x002333BE]
Other than he may not be a man?

Id: [0x002333CB]
Don't need the tour. Already killed the beast.

Id: [0x002333CD]
You think -

Id: [0x002333CE]
You killed -

Id: [0x002333CF]
The <i>Minotaur?!</i>

Id: [0x002333D1]
It was an epic battle. Lots of blood.

Id: [0x002333D3]
An epic battle with a man in a<i> mask!</i>

Id: [0x002333D4]
You were scammed, warrior. But have no fear, you're in Pephka now - a land famous for its honesty and total lack of scams.

Id: [0x002333D7]
His favorite color is <i>rose red</i>!

Id: [0x002333DC]
Remember that horn. You'll hear it throughout the Battle, marking your progress. Now fight!

Id: [0x002333E3]
Kassandra? By the gods, is that you?

Id: [0x00233417]
A mercenary has been raiding sacrifices from our altar and sharing them with a nearby bandit camp. I'd sooner see our sacrifice to the gods destroyed than squandered on those vermin.

Id: [0x00233418]
Are you really worried he's going to try to fight in the battle without it?

Id: [0x00233419]
There's a lot of raiders in these parts. I'm worried he won't even make it to the battle if he's traveling unarmed.

Id: [0x0023341B]
And what of that <i>malákas</i> commander?

Id: [0x0023341E]
He didn't survive our... encounter.

Id: [0x0023341F]
[&laughs]You are a true friend.

Id: [0x00233421]
And what of him?

Id: [0x00233422]
Oh, no matter - you have my sword. That's what's important.

Id: [0x00233426]
Always sharp no matter what, and when you swung her, well... she'd sing a siren song of death. Kept me alive through many a scrape.

Id: [0x00233427]
A local merchant stole my whole supply of styrax resin and made off with it aboard his boat. It's a medicine for asthma and bronchitis.

Id: [0x0023342D]
If that resin was as expensive as it sounds, no wonder you're upset.

Id: [0x0023342F]
I'm sorry you can't treat the people who need it.

Id: [0x00233431]
Thank you. But worse than that, it can put people in a deep sleep if they use too much. It can be quite dangerous.

Id: [0x0023343B]
You don't seem happy about that.

Id: [0x0023343C]
The gods have enough. These offerings should go to those who need it most.

Id: [0x0023343F]
My secret aphrodisiac recipe was stolen! Aphrodite save us all.

Id: [0x00233440]
Did it work?

Id: [0x00233441]
Only too well. In the wrong hands, it could bring down nations. Imagine the Kings of Sparta fighting over a bear!

Id: [0x00233442]
That's very unlikely. But who took the recipe?

Id: [0x00233443]
A gang of bandits with no respect for the dangers of love potions.

Id: [0x00233476]
Why not give it away?

Id: [0x0023349A]
I have other work I need to do. I might get seals for you later.

Id: [0x002334CC]
I do. And I need to get a delivery to a midwife today. But the soldiers are coming for my head because of my impiety.

Id: [0x002334CF]
Kassandra, join us!

Id: [0x002334D3]
I'm here. Now are you going to tell me what's going on?

Id: [0x002334D6]
I'll need to tell Alkibiades what happened.

Id: [0x002334DA]
You saved my life!

Id: [0x002334DB]
Any reason someone would want to kill you?

Id: [0x002334DC]
I'm a politician. Could have been anything. Thank you, misthios.

Id: [0x002334E0]
Ha, it's exactly like we were told! Get him!

Id: [0x002334E4]
Wait, why are we going this way?

Id: [0x002334E8]
Are you sure this is the right way? It doesn't look familiar.

Id: [0x002334EA]
My job was to save his life, not end it. I chose to not help Galeos and I was wrong.

Id: [0x002334EB]
You and I both know that's not why you kept him alive. Stop hiding the truth behind your code.

Id: [0x002334EC]
It was a noble cause.

Id: [0x002334EF]
Amphipolis. This'll be a great empire one day.

Id: [0x00233500]
I bet people from all over come here to worship Aphrodite.

Id: [0x00233504]
<i>Maláka</i>, that smell! Who knew dye so foul would be so expensive?

Id: [0x00233508]
It's so quiet here. Nothing like the rest of the Greek world.

Id: [0x00233514]
These ruins are a good reminder of the devastation the Persians left behind.

Id: [0x00233518]
Know this place, Ikaros? It's where Lykomedes threw Theseus to his death.

Id: [0x0023351C]
Pirates probably use this fort as a lookout.

Id: [0x00233521]
So, let me guess. Alkibiades owed you a favor... or now has some scheme where you owe him.

Id: [0x00233522]
I'm not sure what you mean. He didn't ask anything of me, and I've never known him to do so. I know many people he's helped at the expense of nobody but himself.

Id: [0x00233525]
We should stay on the safest route possible.

Id: [0x00233529]
Smells like rotten eggs...

Id: [0x0023352D]
Fighting with obsidian swords? I'd win against them using my fists.

Id: [0x00233533]
You'd rather lie than trust me.

Id: [0x00233534]
Some things are better left unsaid, and many things are for your own protection.

Id: [0x00233535]
I can protect myself. You know that.

Id: [0x00233536]
Fine, I'll try to be more forthcoming in the future.

Id: [0x00233538]
And why do you always turn to me?

Id: [0x00233539]
You've proven yourself worthy. Plus, I like watching you walk away.

Id: [0x0023353C]
To that end, I present Kassandra!

Id: [0x0023353D]
To be safe, I'd go with a little of both.

Id: [0x0023354A]
You can't have it!

Id: [0x00233553]
Good luck with everything, Alkibiades. If you ever need anything... find someone else.

Id: [0x00233554]
We both know you'll <i>gladly</i> help me again.

Id: [0x00233555]
We'll see.

Id: [0x00233557]
So what was all of this for? Everything you had me do couldn't have been for nothing.

Id: [0x0023357C]
Is this lake full of blood? Wonder what's made it so red?

Id: [0x00233580]
Lokris. Land of salt, and more salt.

Id: [0x00233587]
Beautiful white Parian marble. Should I add some Spartan red?

Id: [0x00233589]
You've earned my trust. Are you sure you want to know?

Id: [0x0023358B]
I almost forgot about that! I needed to get rid of Diodoros to pay off a debt, plus I needed spies to infiltrate Bardas's command.

Id: [0x00233591]
Everything I do has a purpose. I'd like to tell you what that is, but it's too risky to share. Just know you've made things a lot easier for me.

Id: [0x00233592]
Glad I could help... I think.

Id: [0x00233593]
You will be. You'll know one day that what you did was for the greater good. Thank you.

Id: [0x0023359E]
Let's not try to start a revolt while we're here, eh, Ikaros?

Id: [0x002335A2]
I learned about the Code of Gortyn in the agoge as a child.

Id: [0x002335A6]
The legendary Knossos - once palace to King Minos.

Id: [0x002335B1]
This is where Leonidas was laid to rest. [beat]I wish I had known him.

Id: [0x002335B5]
Hippokrates was born here. With all these herbs, it's no wonder he studied medicine.

Id: [0x002335B9]
It's no Mount Pentelikos, but this marble is impressive.

Id: [0x002335BD]
The Daughters of Artemis are strong here. I'll be on my guard.

Id: [0x002335C1]
Poseidon watches over his ocean. While he's distracted, let's see what's in his temple.

Id: [0x002335C5]
With this much silver, they'd rival the Delian League's riches.

Id: [0x002335CB]
These people sure like building boats.

Id: [0x002335CF]
Poseidon's power is strong here.

Id: [0x002335D5]
The Reclining Lion watches over Keos. Didn't see Xenia coming, did he?

Id: [0x002335D9]
What's happened here? Looks like pirates have taken over the city.

Id: [0x002335DB]
I will not break my vow. I'm sorry...

Id: [0x002335DC]
But...

Id: [0x002335DD]
Go, and do not return. If we meet again, I will kill you.

Id: [0x002335DF]
I will not defy Artemis, though it may break my heart. I pledged myself to her long ago.

Id: [0x00233699]
So much marble, and yet they can't finish the building by the port.

Id: [0x0023369D]
They say Zeus grew up in these caves.

Id: [0x002336A1]
This temple is for the god of wine, Dionysos. Bet Markos would like it here.

Id: [0x002336A8]
Come now, Pentheus. We must check to see how your symptoms are progressing.

Id: [0x002336A9]
Pentheus?

Id: [0x002336AB]
Pentheus?!

Id: [0x002336BD]
This armor is <i>very</i> well made. I'll have to remember this...

Id: [0x002336BF]
The man on the roof wasn't kidding. This armor is <i>really</i> well made.

Id: [0x002336C2]
This axe must be pretty important if it's being kept here. I'll have to remember this...

Id: [0x002336C4]
This is the axe the man from the roof wanted. It's pretty heavy. I wonder if he could even lift it...

Id: [0x002336C6]
Think of the riches, Roxana. Indeed, everything you've dreamed of is almost within your grasp.

Id: [0x002336C7]
We can walk away.

Id: [0x002336C8]
Only one of you can walk away a legend.

Id: [0x002336CC]
Only the best warriors rest here. <i>Heroes</i>.

Id: [0x002336CE]
Depends on what you've heard.

Id: [0x002336D0]
Good answer. I don't care if the stories are true - I can see you have it in you. A capacity for greatness. The potential to be... a real<i> hero</i>.

Id: [0x00233765]
Actual Minotaur size may vary.

Id: [0x00233766]
Oh, they're the deadliest!

Id: [0x00233768]
They say Theseus himself was killed by a Minotaur statue.

Id: [0x0023376B]
She <i>was</i>, until I killed -

Id: [0x0023376D]
She's a mythical creature! Like um, like a cyclops.

Id: [0x00233772]
Cyclopes are real too, I've killed -

Id: [0x00233776]
Hey, in Pephka, the hero's always right! This way!

Id: [0x00233778]
Perhaps you'll be the first to return...

Id: [0x00233782]
Well, if it'll help your grandmother...

Id: [0x00233785]
If your elixir's so potent, maybe you could give your grandma a bottle or two?

Id: [0x00233787]
Great idea! ...If you could just pay for them -

Id: [0x00233789]
No?

Id: [0x0023378D]
The warrior must have more - get it out of her!

Id: [0x00233791]
Oh no, no, no, no, absolutely not.

Id: [0x00233793]
Possibly making bad wine on an island somewhere...

Id: [0x002337BE]
[beat]You wouldn't begrudge a man a second chance, would you?

Id: [0x002337E0]
I'd be more than worthy to rest here if someone proved strong enough to kill me.

Id: [0x00233859]
I'll be buried in one of those unmarked holes.

Id: [0x0023385A]
I doubt that. [beat]I've heard tales of you, <i>misthios</i>. Of your triumphs and achievements. They're impressive... if they're true.

Id: [0x002338A8]
Every merchant, every man and his slave earn enough drachmae out of this charade to make Midas blush. The myth of the Minotaur makes us all rich... and we turn a blind eye to the cost.

Id: [0x00233984]
[beat]And don't you be afraid, Leiandros. She needs you.

Id: [0x00233987]
I'd like to have a word with that doctor at the quarry[2408858].

Id: [0x00233988]
What goes on across Thasos is not my concern. But I know my nephew. Ah, yes. He practically <i>worships</i> at the altar of Aergia. A devotee of sloth and idleness, he is.

Id: [0x0023398E]
If <i>she's</i> sick, why did <i>you </i>cough?

Id: [0x00233990]
[beat]I'm very empathetic?

Id: [0x00233991]
No.

Id: [0x00233992]
No.

Id: [0x00233995]
That depends on what you've heard.

Id: [0x0023399C]
[beat]By leaving the safety of your impenetrable fortress and coming out into the open!

Id: [0x002339A1]
When your time comes, do you think you'll be worthy of the title hero, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x002339A2]
So... that's it! Look in this direction! Direct your focus onto me, and only me! Because I'm the Minotaur, like I said! So, I'm priority one! Grr! Stomp, stomp!

Id: [0x002339D7]
Now I have both items the man on the roof needs to bring glory back to his village. I better get these to him before he actually jumps.

Id: [0x002339E9]
Maybe the gods took it back to punish us!

Id: [0x002339EA]
I'm sure it's down there. I heard it splash after this idiot threw it over the cliff.

Id: [0x002339EB]
I'll look again.

Id: [0x002339F8]
I am cursed by the gods!

Id: [0x00233A13]
They're all true. And there's more you don't know about.

Id: [0x00233A14]
There's some truth in the stories, but they're mostly fantasy.

Id: [0x00233A16]
I'm Maion.

Id: [0x00233A17]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00233A18]
If you want to truly live, Kassandra, to become Hero of the Arena, [beat]and to win riches beyond your wildest dreams, you'll need to fight in my arena[2400534].

Id: [0x00233A1A]
Ah, my lovely <i>misthios</i>. What news?

Id: [0x00233A27]
I can't believe we missed him!

Id: [0x00233A2B]
As you can see from the statues, the Minotaur is a fearsome foe - so don't forget this exclusive tour tip: [dramatic pause]He hates being stabbed! Particularly with sharp objects. [conspiratorial]They say it's his only weakness...!

Id: [0x00233A2F]
Here's another helpful tip you won't get on any other tour - the Minotaur... isn't a morning person!

Id: [0x00233A32]
Don't trust the fish merchant! He's been cursed by the Gods to smell like <i>fish!</i>

Id: [0x00233A34]
That's the<i> fish, </i>you half-wit! My hands smell wonderful!

Id: [0x00233A39]
I'm not saying I'm responsible for breaking the Minotaur statue, but I'm also not saying I'm <i>not </i>responsible.

Id: [0x00233A4A]
Had any luck finding the divine bracelet I desire?

Id: [0x00233A4C]
You're back. Good. Will you find the Makedonian bracelet for my pleasure?

Id: [0x00233A51]
Look at these heroes, <i>misthios!</i>

Id: [0x00233A60]
Ah, Thasos. It's been so long since I've seen my nephew, Neleus. I bet he's grown a quite a bit.

Id: [0x00233A62]
No, not one - I'm getting <i>all </i>of it<i>.</i>

Id: [0x00233A64]
Get her!

Id: [0x00233AD0]
You've been a thorn in my side since you landed.

Id: [0x00233AD1]
Soon I'm going to be a blade in your throat.

Id: [0x00233AD2]
Even if you kill me, you will lose, Eagle Bearer. We are everywhere. There isn't a rock you can hide under where we won't find you.

Id: [0x00233AD3]
You are the snakes who hide! I'm going to bury you so deep only Hades will find you.

Id: [0x00233AE4]
And thanks to your victory against the Athenian fleet at sea, their best troops are at the bottom of the Aegean. The day is as good as ours! Join us.

Id: [0x00233AE8]
What a glorious battle! It was an honor to fight by your side, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x00233AEA]
There's just one more thing.

Id: [0x00233AEE]
Come, bring your flesh to my blades!

Id: [0x00233AEF]
I've made a special infusion of buckthorn leaves, but the woman in need is too weak to travel here.

Id: [0x00233AF0]
Why don’t you go to her?

Id: [0x00233AF1]
The roads are rampant with raiders and wild animals that I could never hope to pass safely.

Id: [0x00233AF4]
But... [beat]wearing it makes me feel brave.

Id: [0x00233AFA]
Someone doesn't have a sense of humor.

Id: [0x00233AFF]
You did your job, now leave me alone.

Id: [0x00233B14]
He's been mauled quite badly.

Id: [0x00233B15]
He's lost a lot of blood.

Id: [0x00233B16]
I think these wounds should be sealable.

Id: [0x00233B17]
Wait... I know this man.

Id: [0x00233B18]
This is that monster, Galeos.

Id: [0x00233B1A]
A patient of mine roams the streets. He is delirious... his infection is growing worse.

Id: [0x00233B20]
There must be something we can do for him.

Id: [0x00233B22]
How could you let him leave your care?

Id: [0x00233B24]
I tried to help the man, but bandits took the herbs I was using to develop a cure. Now I'm worried if he continues like this, he may pass his infection onto others.

Id: [0x00233B36]
I could say the same to you! Did you find what you were looking for?

Id: [0x00233B41]
I did. I found my mother.

Id: [0x00233B42]
What a coincidence - I found my Mama too!

Id: [0x00233B43]
Here? In Kos?

Id: [0x00233B44]
I'm still searching.

Id: [0x00233B45]
Hopefully you'll have as much good luck as I've had. I found my long-lost Mama!

Id: [0x00233B47]
They'll be scattered around the warehouse... [beat]And be sure to check the guard captain - anything important, he'll have on him.

Id: [0x00233B49]
Filthy goats are eating up all my precious peonies. I need them for my remedies!

Id: [0x00233B4A]
I see.

Id: [0x00233B4B]
I don't have time to keep chasing them off. I'm behind on my deliveries as is. I've got a politician in town expecting his medicine to arrive today.

Id: [0x00233B58]
Alkibiades. You look like you're having fun.

Id: [0x00233B5B]
On top of that, Kephallonia isn't as, uh,<i> busy</i> as it was before. Plague came from Kausos, and many died. [beat]It was bad for business.

Id: [0x00233B5C]
Fresh supplies were due in the harbor today, and they are sorely needed.

Id: [0x00233B5D]
Your supplies didn't arrive?

Id: [0x00233B5E]
Wretched pirates wiped the boat clean from the horizon. I watched it go down... The sea swallowed all.

Id: [0x00233B65]
Your supplies were surely destroyed.

Id: [0x00233B67]
Hmm. Do you believe there is something to be salvaged?

Id: [0x00233B69]
The supplies are needed badly enough that it's worth searching for them. But I'm not much of a diver... And it's not safe to go near those waters with pirates nearby.

Id: [0x00233BB5]
Hello, there. Need any help?

Id: [0x00233BBA]
Need a mercenary, stranger?

Id: [0x00233BBF]
<i>Chaire</i>. Something I can help you with?

Id: [0x00233BC7]
<i>Chaire</i>, huntress. Anything a mercenary can do for you today?

Id: [0x00233BCC]
Need any help, huntress?

Id: [0x00233BD1]
<i>Chaire</i>. Can I help you, huntress?

Id: [0x00233BD9]
<i>Chaire</i>. Is there something you need?

Id: [0x00233BDE]
Need help with something, friend?

Id: [0x00233BE3]
Anything a <i>misthios</i> can help you with, stranger?

Id: [0x00233BE8]
Thought any more about my request?

Id: [0x00233BED]
Tell me you've reconsidered.

Id: [0x00233BF2]
I could still use your help.

Id: [0x00233BF7]
My offer stands, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00233BFC]
Having second thoughts?

Id: [0x00233C0D]
You're skilled with a blade, aren't you? Maybe you'd be willing to help me out again.

Id: [0x00233C11]
Glad you're on my side. Speaking of... there's something else you could help me with.

Id: [0x00233C1A]
Thanks for stepping in. You know, I have work for someone as skilled as you.

Id: [0x00233C1E]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. I have a job that requires your skill, if you're interested.

Id: [0x00233C28]
I owe you my freedom. But I'm afraid there's more I need help with.

Id: [0x00233C2D]
Thank you, stranger. The truth is, though, I need your help again.

Id: [0x002340CD]
Good. Please handle this... delicately.

Id: [0x002340D1]
The gods are smiling on me, then.

Id: [0x002340D5]
Perfect. Time is of the essence.

Id: [0x002340DC]
May Artemis guide you.

Id: [0x002340E0]
Do this carefully.

Id: [0x002340E4]
Artemis is smiling on me, then.

Id: [0x002340EB]
Then I can rest easy.

Id: [0x002340EF]
Good. You're doing me a great service.

Id: [0x002340F3]
I'm in your debt.

Id: [0x00234149]
I can gather far more information traveling the Aegean with you than I can by staying here. Thank you.

Id: [0x0023414D]
A lust of adventure is what brought me into this line of work. I'm in.

Id: [0x00234151]
I've always craved life on the open sea, and you've done me a great service already. I'm in.

Id: [0x00234158]
You've already proven that Artemis crossed our paths for a reason. Let's see what she has in store for us next.

Id: [0x0023415C]
You'll always have a steady shot with me around.

Id: [0x00234160]
May Artemis guide us on our journey.

Id: [0x00234167]
I never saw myself as a sailor... but I have always wanted to see the world. [beat]I'm in.

Id: [0x0023416B]
A chance to get out of here and sail with you? Wouldn't miss it.

Id: [0x0023416F]
Life on the sea doesn't sound easy... but then, neither is life here. [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x0023417A]
There's too much afoot here that needs my attention, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023417E]
I've got my share of adventure here and then some. I'm afraid I can't join you.

Id: [0x00234182]
My skills are needed here, misthios. I can't join you.

Id: [0x00234189]
Ha! A huntress on open waters? I don't think so.

Id: [0x0023418D]
My bow will be of no use against the sharks, misthios. I can't join you.

Id: [0x00234191]
I'm no sailor, misthios. I carry out Artemis's will with my feet planted firmly on land.

Id: [0x00234198]
Ha! People pay me a great deal to travel with them, <i>misthios</i>. I doubt my fee is one you can afford.

Id: [0x0023419C]
A hetaera goes where she chooses when she pleases. The confines of your ship are far too limiting for me.

Id: [0x002341A0]
I do wish to see the world, <i>misthios</i>. But on my own terms, not yours.

Id: [0x002341A4]
You're a true warrior. Please, take this as thanks.

Id: [0x002341A8]
You've helped me more than you know. Take this.

Id: [0x002341AC]
We were fated to meet, after all. Here, this is yours.

Id: [0x002341B0]
You've set great things in motion. Take this as thanks.

Id: [0x002341B4]
Thank you for all you've done. Please, take this.

Id: [0x002341BD]
You knew this task was delicate. And still, you failed.

Id: [0x002341C0]
You've failed me greatly, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002341C3]
Had I known this would happen, I never would have sent you.

Id: [0x002341C6]
I depended on you, and you let me down.

Id: [0x002341C9]
How could you let this happen? This was important!

Id: [0x002341D3]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x002341D5]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x002341D7]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x002341D9]
I'd like to take you at your word, but... I'm sure you must have some evidence that they really are all dead.

Id: [0x002341DE]
Seems odd that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any proof he's free?

Id: [0x002341E0]
I really think I would have heard from her by now if she were free. Do you have any proof that you finished the job?

Id: [0x002341E2]
I'd like to take you at your word that the beast has gone free, but... do you have any proof that the job's been done?

Id: [0x002341E6]
Last I heard, he was still causing trouble. Do you have any proof that he's no longer a concern?

Id: [0x002341E8]
She still seems to be an active concern from what I've heard. Do you have any proof that she's been dealt with?

Id: [0x002341ED]
Until we know each other better... Do you have any proof it's been destroyed?

Id: [0x002341EF]
I'd like to believe you but... something's off. Do you have any proof they've been destroyed?

Id: [0x002341F3]
It feels strange that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any evidence that he's no longer vulnerable?

Id: [0x002341F5]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x002341F9]
Your loss.

Id: [0x002341FD]
Think it over.

Id: [0x00234201]
I'll be around if you change your mind.

Id: [0x00234209]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0023420B]
The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0023420D]
So be it.

Id: [0x00234215]
I can match my bounty and then some, I'm sure.

Id: [0x00234217]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x00234219]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0023421F]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x00234221]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x00234227]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x00234229]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023422F]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x00234231]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x00234233]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00234235]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x00234237]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x00234239]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x0023423B]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x0023423D]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00234241]
Praise the gods. I'm free!

Id: [0x00234244]
Please, my patients need those herbs. I'll pay you well.

Id: [0x0023424E]
I won't stop fighting until Delos is free, or I die. Thanks to you, it's looking good for Delos.

Id: [0x00234254]
[&groan]Land of gods, [&spits]I haven't seen any. Only death.

Id: [0x0023425A]
Sokrates, another foreigner has spilled blood on sacred soil!

Id: [0x0023425B]
Perhaps they did. But mistakes are a failure of intellect, not character... Are they not?

Id: [0x0023425C]
These are sacred lands. Our laws are clear!

Id: [0x0023425D]
[&ah]Are they? If it is not possible to know what is right, and thus do wrong, then the foreigner acted out of ignorance, not malice.

Id: [0x0023425E]
So, you say we need to tell every person on the island what the laws are?

Id: [0x00234260]
If a law is truly just, is it not knowable through deduction alone?

Id: [0x0023426C]
I've found my monster.

Id: [0x002342B7]
Go now, and adventure. Come back anytime for that cup of wine!

Id: [0x002342B8]
Right... We'll see about that.

Id: [0x002342C3]
You look strong and prepared for anything. My patients need mandrake herbs. There's a patch of them growing by a little stream southeast of here.

Id: [0x002342D2]
Will you come to the hideout[2315766] now, or meet us there later?

Id: [0x002342DD]
There's no time to waste. We'll go to the hideout[2315766] now.

Id: [0x002342E1]
There's some things I want to see first. I'll join you both later.

Id: [0x002342E2]
Don't take too long, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002342EA]
I have other tasks, but I'll return if I have time.

Id: [0x002342EF]
I'll bring you the herbs. You said they were southeast of here?

Id: [0x002342F9]
Did you find the mandrake herbs yet? The sooner I can prepare them, the better.

Id: [0x00234309]
Thank you for helping me with my patients.

Id: [0x00234310]
How long till Podarkes finds us? We're right under his nose!

Id: [0x00234311]
His nose is so high in the air, he couldn't find the Statue of Artemis Agrotera if he was standing on her head.

Id: [0x00234321]
Lykaon said the herbs would be near a little stream. That looks like it.

Id: [0x00234325]
These must be the herbs Lykaon wanted.

Id: [0x00234353]
Thank you again. This is the last time I ever drink so much.

Id: [0x00234358]
There's so many ways to use an <i>olisbos</i>... Care to see?

Id: [0x0023435A]
The farm in Astypalia City? I burned those silos, and I didn't see any Cerberus there.

Id: [0x0023435B]
What? Their soldiers are always hanging around...

Id: [0x0023435C]
I'm sure. There were only scared farmers.

Id: [0x0023435D]
No dogs and no Cerberus... Maybe it's not their farm after all. We sure dodged <i>that</i> arrow.

Id: [0x0023435E]
It won't stop the Cerberus from coming for you.

Id: [0x00234364]
Now, I'll make my way to Megaris. Thank you, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00234367]
Local farmers let their goats come through these parts. I've tried scaring them off... [beat]The goats, not the farmers! But they don't listen.

Id: [0x00234368]
Goats aren't usually dangerous.

Id: [0x00234369]
Well, I'm growing a new type of herb nearby. It's a stomach remedy and it gives you visions of the gods! Maybe that's why the goats eat so much of it...

Id: [0x0023436A]
Have you tried talking to the goatherds? Maybe you could convince them to move their flocks.

Id: [0x0023436B]
I have, but the farmers insist on grazing their goats here... Though I suppose sending a gift might convince them.

Id: [0x00234375]
Please, I have a lot to attend to.

Id: [0x0023437A]
It's such a beautiful day, and there will be so many more to come... Thanks to <i>you</i>, Kassandra.

Id: [0x002343E5]
Kyra will lead us to victory. I tear apart anyone who gets in her way.

Id: [0x002343E8]
I can't go looking for herbs anymore. There are too many bears around.

Id: [0x002343E9]
One bear can be too many. Have you noticed more of them than usual?

Id: [0x002343EA]
Yes, ever since a gang of bandits set up in the forest. Their food is attracting them.

Id: [0x0023440A]
Return to me when Podarkes's supplies have been destroyed.

Id: [0x0023440D]
Do you know what you get when you mix pink heartleaf with wine?

Id: [0x0023440E]
Let me guess, really strong wine?

Id: [0x0023440F]
Yes! That's why my sister wanted me to bring her some. She's making a batch of special wine for a merchant.

Id: [0x00234410]
You could just bring it when you've sobered up.

Id: [0x00234411]
I could, but you know what too much pink heartleaf does? Projectile vomiting. Oh dear...

Id: [0x00234465]
You! Are you... Kassandra of House Agiad?

Id: [0x00234466]
Good. He'll learn how to be a man like his father and brother, or he'll die trying.

Id: [0x0023447C]
Thanks for coming with me. Would you say you've killed many people?

Id: [0x0023447D]
Why do you ask me that?

Id: [0x00234485]
Have you taken my son to the <i>agoge</i> camp yet?

Id: [0x00234486]
But my service needs to be rewarded.

Id: [0x00234487]
Of course. You would be paid well for your time.

Id: [0x00234488]
Bandits just stole my mandrake root! They could use it to poison someone.

Id: [0x00234489]
Then why did you have it?

Id: [0x0023448A]
In smaller doses, it can reduce pain and put patients to sleep. But I suspect their chief has more nefarious purposes.

Id: [0x0023448E]
Oh, the wine we will drink when Podarkes is dead!

Id: [0x002344D3]
She spoke false prophecies for years. Those who came to her for advice received only lies.

Id: [0x002344D4]
Your grandmother... was an oracle?

Id: [0x002344D5]
Yes, up on the hill in Delphi! She confessed to me recently that she never heard the gods, and only repeated the words she was told.

Id: [0x002344D6]
Told by vile people with evil intentions.

Id: [0x002344D7]
Bandits have been looting the bodies of the fallen. But a curse on the grave robbers will end their violation.

Id: [0x002344D8]
Interesting plan.

Id: [0x002344D9]
Those filthy looters will try to prevent my ritual, I’m sure of it. And the stench of death is sure to draw wild animals near.

Id: [0x002344E1]
That should be all the hemlock I need.

Id: [0x002344EC]
That tablet you carry. It was a curse I crafted and sent a bastard for his spurned lover. He thought it just a trinket.

Id: [0x002344F2]
He died at my hand. Your "magic" had nothing to do with it.

Id: [0x002344F4]
Ha. I suppose your curse worked. He certainly met a bloody end.

Id: [0x002344F6]
I cursed the man to die, and he did. I leave the rest to gods and mercenaries. There is another tablet... but a bandit chief stole it before I could curse my true target, a vile politician.

Id: [0x00234537]
A Thessalian witch has come to town and set up a little shrine from which she casts spells. My customers are abandoning me.

Id: [0x00234538]
Wait. You're a witch with a business rival?

Id: [0x00234539]
Witches need to eat, too. There's only so much magic to go around, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00234643]
Those supplies aren't going anywhere. There are more immediate things I can do to take down Podarkes.

Id: [0x00234645]
Podarkes's stockpile is in the Kynthos Ruins on Delos Island. That's where we strike.

Id: [0x00234651]
You mean your father.

Id: [0x00234653]
I was raised by hunters, rogue warriors, mercenaries. They are my true family. That man is nothing to me.

Id: [0x00234657]
It isn't your fault that he's your father, Kyra. We can't choose our families.

Id: [0x00234659]
No. We can't choose them. But we can avenge them. And I will make him pay for what he did to my <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x00234F51]
They tell me you could hear the crowds from all the way out here. Their thirst never quenched.

Id: [0x00234F52]
Thirst for what?

Id: [0x00234F53]
Combat in the arena, misthios! Life and death  in their purest forms. Love. Hate. Glory and ruin. All there for the crowds to devour. [beat]My name is Skoura.

Id: [0x00234F7A]
Though I do hope his grandmother gets better...

Id: [0x00234F8F]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00234F91]
These walls no longer shake because there are no heroes of the arena left. The crowds don't care about real fighters anymore. They just want blood. [hopeful]But you, <i>misthios</i>. You could change that... You could <i>make</i> them care.

Id: [0x00234FAE]
Diakofti Island! The merchant said his ship was beached there off the Eastern Coast.

Id: [0x00234FB2]
That must be the merchant's ship.

Id: [0x00234FBA]
This is Zeus’s Playground. The mountain[2378770] will be here.

Id: [0x00234FBF]
The mountain[2378770]! The flower should be on its summit.

Id: [0x00234FC9]
The island of Anaphi. The wife said her husband fishes off the west coast.

Id: [0x00234FCB]
That -

Id: [0x00234FD0]
There's the fisherman's boat!

Id: [0x00234FDA]
There's the cave[2106110].

Id: [0x00234FE0]
...But <i>honor</i> is not. You'll find no honor jumping off this building. Only death. Talk to me.

Id: [0x00234FE1]
...Honor. Yes.

Id: [0x00234FED]
Fisherman's Beacon. That's where the priestess said Swordfish used to live.

Id: [0x00234FF2]
That must be the cave[2106106].

Id: [0x00234FF6]
That might actually work.

Id: [0x00234FFE]
There are five current champions. Each one more bloodthirsty and ruthless than the last. You'll need to defeat each of them if you're to be called Hero of the Arena.

Id: [0x00235002]
There's the road the lion was traveling on.

Id: [0x00235007]
This must be Zeus’s Playground.

Id: [0x0023500C]
The Lost Minoan Shrine. The merchant said the lynxes roam north of there.

Id: [0x00235013]
There it is. Octopus Bay.

Id: [0x0023501B]
There is the road to Kydonia.

Id: [0x0023501F]
The house on the left. Isabel must be there.

Id: [0x00235027]
Kydonia. The temple should be west of here.

Id: [0x0023502C]
The Sunken Ruins.

Id: [0x00235031]
The Temple of Britomartis.

Id: [0x00235037]
Skandeia Harbor. The wife said her husband headed southwest of there. <LF>

Id: [0x0023503C]
This must be the ruins[2388471] the wife mentioned.

Id: [0x00235041]
Diakofti Island. That's where the merchant said the treasure was.

Id: [0x00235047]
This must be the customs warehouse[2388469].

Id: [0x0023504C]
The Chytra Atoll.

Id: [0x00235051]
There it is. The Shipwreck Campsite.

Id: [0x00235056]
There's the Olive Farm that Eritha mentioned.

Id: [0x0023505E]
There's Pilgrim Hill. Eritha said the handmaiden was last seen east of here.

Id: [0x0023506D]
He's the master of the arena. If <i>he's</i> sent you to me, then he expects great things from you.

Id: [0x00235070]
Oh fantastic!

Id: [0x00235071]
And fear not, friend - this is a lie that will <i>save </i>my people. It'll put us back on the map! [beat]Well, um... Can I - can I have my items now please?

Id: [0x00235075]
There's Phaistos Village. The old man should be there somewhere.

Id: [0x0023507A]
There's the old man amongst those guards.

Id: [0x0023507F]
The collector said the cave was hidden inside this fort.

Id: [0x00235084]
The hidden cave!

Id: [0x00235091]
There's Heraklion. Ardos said the Swordfish would be found here.

Id: [0x00235096]
There's Heraklion Fish Market.

Id: [0x0023509A]
Just, uh, turn around for a second... While I... change...

Id: [0x002350A0]
This is the field where the father said the children are hiding.

Id: [0x002350A6]
This lake for the trial of endurance seems normal enough.

Id: [0x002350CA]
C'mon!

Id: [0x002350CC]
5 drachmae says he jumps.

Id: [0x002350CD]
25 says he doesn't.

Id: [0x002350D0]
How long's he been up there?

Id: [0x002350D1]
Three, maybe 4 days?

Id: [0x002350D2]
Should we get him water, or...? [beat]How long have <i>you</i> been here watching him?!

Id: [0x002350D3]
Like I said, 3, maybe 4 days?

Id: [0x002350D6]
Come down from there!

Id: [0x002350DD]
Don't be a fool! Think of your mater! [beat]And if that makes you want to jump more... Maybe think of something else!

Id: [0x002350DF]
Athena, give him strength...! [calling out]Please, just come down!

Id: [0x002350E1]
It's not safe up there! Come down and fight the Minotaur!

Id: [0x002350E3]
Why's he up there?

Id: [0x002350E4]
I heard he fell in love with the Minotaur, who rejected his advances - and his broken heart drove him to madness.

Id: [0x002350E5]
Really? I heard he just wanted to get a really good view of Lato, and forgot how to get down.

Id: [0x002350E8]
Someone help him!

Id: [0x002350F0]
Let's get serious.

Id: [0x002350FA]
Maybe the stories I've heard <i>are</i> true...

Id: [0x002350FD]
Skoura.

Id: [0x002350FE]
Maion.

Id: [0x0023510D]
This looks like a contract: "Deliver the package to the drop-off, and don't damage it." If they mean Lykaon's grandmother, chances are she's alive.

Id: [0x00235113]
Praxithea must have lost this bracelet in the struggle. But no ordinary thief would have left something so valuable behind.

Id: [0x0023511C]
I don't <i>want</i> to do this, Agave. But for the sake of justice, we can't let Praxithea live.

Id: [0x0023511D]
What kind of justice is that?

Id: [0x00235167]
You know, you've made me curious. Let's try it out.

Id: [0x00235168]
I knew you'd be <i>open</i> to it.

Id: [0x0023516B]
That was... something.

Id: [0x0023516C]
It's different, but you'll get used to it.

Id: [0x0023516E]
[&ah]I hope you're right.

Id: [0x00235170]
That's not what I meant. Guess I <i>can </i>turn you down after all.

Id: [0x00235171]
I deserved that.

Id: [0x00235176]
Praxithea was kidnapped and brought to a farm west of here. The bandits were hired to deliver her alive.

Id: [0x00235177]
Thank you for figuring that out, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0023517D]
I have an idea of what happened to your grandmother, but I want to make sure. I'll keep looking.

Id: [0x0023517F]
I haven't found anything yet. But I'll keep looking.

Id: [0x00235183]
Kassandra? By the gods, is that you?

Id: [0x00235188]
Hey, thief! That's my sword. I paid good drachmae for that.

Id: [0x0023518E]
Did you see that new sword the commander just bought?

Id: [0x0023518F]
As fine a blade as ever I've seen.

Id: [0x00235190]
Got it from the new smith, I heard him say.

Id: [0x00235191]
[chuckle]Yeah, the smith didn't make it, though. He can knock a dent out all right, but that sword... That's real craftsmanship, that is.

Id: [0x00235198]
What are you doing back alone? I take it you didn't rescue my friend?

Id: [0x0023519E]
I cursed the blood of the soldiers. They are coming to take me. They've already taken one of my sisters.

Id: [0x002351BE]
Pit and fire call for sacrifice. Burnt whole under the sky. Blood for Hermes. Entrails for Hekate.

Id: [0x002351BF]
What kind of sacrifice are you talking about?

Id: [0x002351C0]
Skin a wolf. Leave it in salt. Spill a shark open while looking to the west. Goats, I suppose. There are always goats about. Nice little bags of blood and bone, goats...

Id: [0x002351CE]
Kassandra, I...

Id: [0x002351D1]
Don't say anything. [beat]You have a battle to prepare for. And I have an Athenian army to weaken.

Id: [0x002351D4]
I bound a terrible curse to a lead tablet under the moon days past. But it has not taken effect.

Id: [0x002351DA]
Curses don't kill people. I do.

Id: [0x002351DC]
Are you sure you did it right?

Id: [0x002351DE]
I have said a man must die, and so he must. The bandits have taken my tablet for themselves. How can I complete my curse now?

Id: [0x002351ED]
Please, Eros. Let it be me. Let him pick me!

Id: [0x002351F2]
I got here first, back off! The scion will pick <i>me!</i>

Id: [0x002351F5]
Let me guess, he's rich.

Id: [0x002351F7]
That's Aetios! The scion of the most influential family in Keos. And his wife-choosing ceremony is tomorrow!

Id: [0x002351F8]
We need Eros's blessings to be picked.

Id: [0x002351FD]
You hope to marry into riches.

Id: [0x002351FE]
No! My feelings are for Aetios, not his wealth.

Id: [0x00235209]
Even if your <i>feelings </i>for him are <i>real</i>.

Id: [0x0023520A]
They get stronger with drachmae.

Id: [0x0023520B]
No! I really am in love with him!

Id: [0x0023520D]
Your eyes tell of your true feelings.

Id: [0x0023520E]
I-I feel like you're making fun of me.

Id: [0x00235212]
Have you seen anything strange going on around here?

Id: [0x00235213]
Well, if bandits taking over my cousin's farm is strange, yes.

Id: [0x00235218]
Bandits set up shop in my cousin's farm west of here. Bastards.

Id: [0x0023521D]
You better start praying like the rest of them.

Id: [0x0023521E]
No, I have to stand out! If I do what everyone else is doing, I'll never be picked by Eros <i>or </i>Aetios.

Id: [0x00235221]
<i>Anything?</i>

Id: [0x00235225]
Yes, anything!

Id: [0x00235228]
Let me help, I'm a witch of Hekate, goddess of witchcraft and magic. I know just the thing.

Id: [0x0023522B]
A love potion<i>.</i>

Id: [0x00235235]
[&groan]Spartans. All war and no play.

Id: [0x00235236]
You're a fine warrior. You've done much for the rebellion. And Sparta. But I sailed to these islands for Kyra.

Id: [0x00235238]
You have honor, Thaletas. You don't know what you're missing, but you have honor.

Id: [0x00235239]
Ridiculous. Love potions are a myth -

Id: [0x0023523B]
I've seen stranger things work.

Id: [0x0023523E]
I'll buy it from you, please! Sell it to me, and don't let the others hear you.

Id: [0x00235243]
A love potion is tailored to the imbiber. I have to make one.

Id: [0x00235244]
First, we'll need two things. A cask of the finest wine, and some wild mushrooms.

Id: [0x00235248]
This land is possessed by madness. It caused our leader to die by the hand of a demon-driven assassin. Beasts, pirates, bandits, and Spartans have polluted our lands.

Id: [0x00235249]
Your leader died by a mortal's hand, not godly powers.

Id: [0x0023524A]
So you say. But these remaining vessels of mania must be purged.

Id: [0x0023524F]
Where can I find that at such short notice?

Id: [0x00235250]
I'm sure the <i>misthios</i> could procure these items for you.

Id: [0x00235255]
The rebel hideout[2315766] is southwest of here.

Id: [0x0023525A]
But?

Id: [0x0023525B]
But I sailed here for Kyra. She's the one I fight for... for now.

Id: [0x00235260]
Kassandra! Are you ready to rescue my grandmother? You said she's being held at a farm west of here.

Id: [0x00235269]
I have to prepare first. I'll be back when I'm ready.

Id: [0x0023526B]
I want to hear what Praxithea has to say. I'll go ahead and free her. You can follow.

Id: [0x0023526E]
Please, <i>misthios</i>! Please, you've got to help me. In the name of <i>love.</i>

Id: [0x0023526F]
Fine. I'll get the ingredients for your love potion.

Id: [0x00235274]
Engage in this madness on your own.

Id: [0x00235275]
Please <i>misthios</i>, this is my only chance to be with Aetios!

Id: [0x00235281]
There's more. I also found your helmet.

Id: [0x00235290]
Please, go ahead and free Praxithea. I'll join you later.

Id: [0x00235298]
It will be my honor to take him to begin his education as a Spartan.

Id: [0x00235299]
You are an agent of Zeus.

Id: [0x002352A3]
Please, I need you to free my grandmother.

Id: [0x002352A6]
The Oracle of Trophonios. I wonder if the Cult's working here, too?

Id: [0x002352AA]
So much devastation.

Id: [0x002352AE]
Scars from the Persian war. Let's see what we can find, Ikaros.

Id: [0x002352B2]
Thebians. [spit]Cowards that surrendered to Xerxes.

Id: [0x002352B7]
"The finest wine" isn't much to go on. How will I get it?

Id: [0x002352B8]
A shipment of expensive wine was lost in a shipwreck recently.

Id: [0x002352B9]
Look around the wreckage in Pirate Bay, and you'll find a cask or two, if it hasn't already been pillaged by pirates. It's beached on the west coast of the island.

Id: [0x002352BA]
Where will I find wild mushrooms?

Id: [0x002352BB]
No, no! A new shipment of very special mushrooms has arrived at the Customs Warehouse. Fetch me some of those.

Id: [0x002352BC]
The forest is gone. Many soldiers are dead. It's terrible, but death and fire leave power in their wake.

Id: [0x002352BD]
What kind of power?

Id: [0x002352BE]
Blood power. The wolves and the cannibals who have come for the bodies are taking the power for themselves. It must be released.

Id: [0x002352C0]
That's all. I'll see to the items.

Id: [0x002352C1]
Excellent. Meet us at the temple[2378806] on the hilltop when you're done.

Id: [0x002352C8]
They sure like the Minotaur here.

Id: [0x002352D0]
Barnabas told me about The Arena. I should give it a go.

Id: [0x002352D6]
I'll get the items and meet you at the temple[2378806] on the hilltop.

Id: [0x002352D7]
I'm counting on you, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x002352DA]
You're back so soon? Did you get everything we need for the love potion?

Id: [0x002352DB]
Or did you forget something?

Id: [0x002352E5]
There's something different about this village.

Id: [0x002352E9]
These mastic trees are crying - tears of Chios, that is.

Id: [0x002352ED]
What happened to these trees? I shouldn't be here.

Id: [0x002352F1]
Look at these vineyards. Even Markos couldn't make shitty wine with these grapes.

Id: [0x002352F4]
A woman has come to me to curse a man. A bastard. He must die... But he is powerful, a rich politician.

Id: [0x002352F5]
A powerful man dies like any other.

Id: [0x002352F6]
A target like this could make my reputation for curses. Perhaps I should send him a poisoned bottle of wine. Or an assassin. [beat]Just to speed up the curse, you understand.

Id: [0x002352FF]
Do you think I'm stupid? I know enough to see when someone has been poisoned.

Id: [0x00235300]
He wanted a peaceful death, and I gave it to him.

Id: [0x00235302]
I did nothing except what you asked me to do.

Id: [0x0023530A]
Kassandra. I would have died many deaths if not for this. I owe you more than just thanks.

Id: [0x0023530D]
Animals outnumber people three to one in Tegea. Better watch out for predators.

Id: [0x00235311]
These rocks look like the constellation of Kallisto the Bear. <i>Mater</i> showed it to me when I was young.

Id: [0x00235315]
Let's hope Herakles killed all of the Stymphalian birds.

Id: [0x00235319]
They call Arkadia the "breadbasket of the Peloponnesian League." Wheat's the most precious resource in the Greek world...

Id: [0x0023531D]
I will.

Id: [0x0023531F]
When you're not busy saving these islands, meet me on the beach, east of the Kynthos Ruins. There's something I want to show you. Look for the smoke.

Id: [0x00235320]
You'll find the agoge camp[2374606] southwest of here, near the foothills of the mountains. [beat]Makarios, come here.

Id: [0x00235330]
I can escort your son to the camp master.

Id: [0x00235331]
I have no time to be your mule.

Id: [0x00235336]
That must be the shipwreck she was talking about.

Id: [0x0023533B]
The Customs Warehouse. Better get looking for those mushrooms.

Id: [0x0023544D]
Another witch was taken by the soldiers. She lived in a cave nearby, and she was very powerful. The soldiers may have captured her, but they must have left her shrine. Her magic lingers.

Id: [0x0023544E]
Does it matter?

Id: [0x0023544F]
The elements are out of control now without her to command them.

Id: [0x0023545F]
This is all the wine left. The looters stripped the shipwreck clean.

Id: [0x00235464]
These should do fine. Though... they don't look safe to eat.

Id: [0x00235474]
Don't thank me, voice of Apollo. Or were those someone else's words you spoke?

Id: [0x00235475]
So you've met my grandson. You're right, I lied to everyone. I am so sorry... The gods should have killed me by now. Instead, they made me live with my remorse.

Id: [0x00235490]
Grandmother...

Id: [0x00235499]
Look who has returned.

Id: [0x0023549A]
<i>Misthios</i>! We're over here!

Id: [0x0023551B]
Here's everything you asked for.

Id: [0x0023551E]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0023551F]
Now, I just need a more... personal artifact, the last ingredient.

Id: [0x0023552F]
This woman betrayed the trust of the gods and of the people who seek their wisdom. In the name of all those betrayed by your false prophecies, oracle, I end your miserable life.

Id: [0x00235534]
I... I... I can't.

Id: [0x00235535]
Then this is where I leave. Live as a killer or live as a coward, Lykaon. I can't help you anymore.

Id: [0x00235537]
I've come this far, I'll see it through. What else do you need, witch?

Id: [0x00235539]
I'm not fetching anything else for you.

Id: [0x0023553C]
We need to cut the mandrake with a bronze knife and dance under the moonlight, singing erotic songs to give it power.

Id: [0x00235544]
Eagle Bearer, I hope I did not offend before. It would be a great honor for my son if you could escort him to commence his military training.

Id: [0x00235546]
That sounds like a... unique way to pass an evening.

Id: [0x00235548]
"Erotic songs" really isn't the kind of work I do.

Id: [0x0023554A]
No, it's <i>our</i> ritual, not yours. But the bandits don't like our dancing. They've tried to stop it before and they're about to try again. We need to make sure that doesn't happen.

Id: [0x00235551]
No, no. What I need, the girl can provide.

Id: [0x00235552]
I'll give you whatever you need to be with Aetios.

Id: [0x00235553]
We'll just need a little snip of your beautiful locks.

Id: [0x00235554]
Your part in this is done, misthios. Come to the selection ceremony at Aetios's house[2400868] to witness the fruits of your labor. It's the one overlooking the sea.

Id: [0x00235555]
You've gotta come! Once Aetios picks me, I'll make sure to pay you your due!

Id: [0x00235556]
I hope he has deep pockets. His love didn't come cheap.

Id: [0x00235557]
Come. There's much left to do. See you at the ceremony, misthios.

Id: [0x0023556B]
She's dead.

Id: [0x00235576]
I've decided! I'd always sidelined you growing up, but now my heart knows you are the one for me. We will be happy together, I know it.

Id: [0x00235594]
So, this is Kallisto the Bear!

Id: [0x00235596]
Our new leaders aren't taking care of those of us who were here before. They need to feel the wrath of our gods.

Id: [0x0023559C]
I get results a lot faster than curses and gods.

Id: [0x0023559E]
Tartaros is filled with those who have taken my wrath lightly.

Id: [0x002355A0]
I've already cursed them. And now they're coming for me.

Id: [0x002355AC]
King of beasts.

Id: [0x002355B4]
A curse upon the soldiers who were supposed to defend this village!

Id: [0x002355B5]
What happened?

Id: [0x002355B6]
They ran. The Spartans took the village. Took what they wanted. A curse on cowards. A curse on Sparta.

Id: [0x002355C7]
I was trying to bind a curse to a tablet to destroy the bandit chief who has been raiding the village.

Id: [0x002355C8]
What's that got to do with me?

Id: [0x002355C9]
A thief stole the tablet before I could complete the curse! The bandit raids will continue unchecked.

Id: [0x002355CD]
This is the city we could see from Mount Ainos, Ikaros. I've always dreamed of coming here.

Id: [0x002355D1]
Kronos, is that a baby or the Omphalos you're eating?

Id: [0x002355D5]
Unbelievable craftsmanship. Much better than the statue on Kephallonia.

Id: [0x002355DF]
That's a big pig.

Id: [0x00235608]
The temple's been ransacked. The sacred offering... it's gone.

Id: [0x00235609]
Do you know who took it?

Id: [0x0023560A]
It has to be those bandits. They've got a camp nearby. I'm the fifth daughter in my line to guard this temple. My family will never forgive me if I don't get it back.

Id: [0x0023560E]
I'm not sure rescue is the word to use. If Praxithea was the false oracle who destroyed my family...

Id: [0x0023560F]
She's my responsibility. I must be the one to end her life. But will you please free her from the bandits?

Id: [0x0023561C]
I'm Kassandra. I've also been wronged by a false prophecy. It might have been your grandmother's.

Id: [0x00235641]
By Zeus, you'd do that for me?

Id: [0x00235643]
That's right.

Id: [0x00235645]
That would be the plan.

Id: [0x00235647]
Will you?

Id: [0x00235649]
Yes. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x0023564B]
You read me like an oracle.

Id: [0x0023564D]
Yes, exactly.

Id: [0x0023564F]
The glory is all yours if you accept. Do you?

Id: [0x00235651]
I beg you.

Id: [0x00235653]
The gods show me mercy. That is exactly what I desire.

Id: [0x00235655]
That would be the idea, yes.

Id: [0x00235657]
That would be ideal.

Id: [0x00235659]
Are you up for it?

Id: [0x0023565B]
Exactly, my friend.

Id: [0x0023565D]
That's exactly it. Will you do it?

Id: [0x0023565F]
It should be an easy task for someone with your talent.

Id: [0x00235661]
I would be in your debt.

Id: [0x00235663]
Then you understand.

Id: [0x00235665]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x00235667]
By the gods, you read my mind.

Id: [0x00235669]
Obviously. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x0023566B]
Can I count on you?

Id: [0x0023566D]
I knew I asked the right person.

Id: [0x0023566F]
That's exactly it. Will you do it for me?

Id: [0x00235671]
You understand perfectly, then.

Id: [0x00235673]
You understand quickly.

Id: [0x00235675]
You catch on fast. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00235677]
Ah. Not only do you possess the strength of Heracles, but the wits of Hermes, too.

Id: [0x00235703]
Yes. His death is the only answer.

Id: [0x00235705]
Yes. He must die.

Id: [0x00235707]
He must be struck down with all your strength.

Id: [0x00235709]
Yes, his death will solve everything.

Id: [0x0023570B]
His blood must be spilled.

Id: [0x0023570D]
Exactly. He must be gutted.

Id: [0x0023570F]
His blood should stain the earth.

Id: [0x00235711]
I can't hide my desires. He must die.

Id: [0x00235713]
His death is the only solution.

Id: [0x0023571C]
Yes, it must die.

Id: [0x0023571E]
That's right. It can't live.

Id: [0x00235720]
View this as a sacrifice to the gods.

Id: [0x00235722]
Of course! It must be put to rest.

Id: [0x00235724]
If your blade moves as fast as your mind, it doesn't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00235726]
Exactly. It must die.

Id: [0x00235728]
Yes. Its heart must stop.

Id: [0x00235730]
Please, she must die.

Id: [0x00235732]
Yes, I want her dead.

Id: [0x00235734]
Yes, she must go to Hades.

Id: [0x00235736]
Yes, her time has come.

Id: [0x00235738]
Her death is the only solution.

Id: [0x0023573A]
You have good instincts, <i>misthios</i>. I want her dead.

Id: [0x00235743]
You understand quickly. I need every last one to die.

Id: [0x00235745]
Yes. None should be left standing.

Id: [0x00235747]
Every last one of them must be slain.

Id: [0x00235749]
That's right. I want them all dead.

Id: [0x0023574B]
All of them.

Id: [0x0023574D]
Yes, <i>misthios</i>. Each of them must die.

Id: [0x0023574F]
Exactly. None should be left alive.

Id: [0x00235753]
Yes, all of them must die.

Id: [0x00235755]
Yes, all of them must be gutted. Do you accept?

Id: [0x0023575C]
Exactly. Nothing should be left of it.

Id: [0x0023575E]
Yes, it must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x00235760]
You know your craft. Leave no trace.

Id: [0x00235762]
Nothing should be left of it. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00235764]
By Apollo, you understand. It needs to disappear.

Id: [0x0023576A]
Exactly. Every last one of them.

Id: [0x0023576C]
Yes, they all must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x0023576E]
No need to speak more. All must disappear.

Id: [0x00235770]
Nothing should be left. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00235777]
By the gods, you understand. She must go free.

Id: [0x00235779]
Not an easy task but yes, she must escape.

Id: [0x0023577B]
Yes, please. She must be rescued.

Id: [0x0023577D]
Exactly. She must go free.

Id: [0x0023577F]
I would be forever in your debt if she is freed.

Id: [0x00235786]
By the gods, yes. He must be rescued.

Id: [0x00235788]
Not an easy task, but yes, I want him out of there.

Id: [0x0023578A]
He must walk free.

Id: [0x0023578C]
Please make sure he gets out of there safely.

Id: [0x0023578E]
I would be forever in your debt if he were saved.

Id: [0x00235791]
By the gods, yes. The creature must go free.

Id: [0x00235797]
Yes, I need it back at all costs.

Id: [0x00235799]
Yes, it needs to be returned without a scratch.

Id: [0x0023579B]
By the gods, I need it back. In one piece, please.

Id: [0x0023579D]
Simple enough. I need it back in good shape.

Id: [0x002357A3]
Yes, any you can bring me will help.

Id: [0x002357A5]
Yes, I'll take any you can find.

Id: [0x002357A7]
By the gods, yes. Any will help.

Id: [0x002357A9]
Simple enough. Any you can find will help.

Id: [0x002357AF]
Exactly. It must arrive without a scratch.

Id: [0x002357B1]
Yes, it needs to get there in one piece.

Id: [0x002357B3]
You got it. The job will be finished once it arrives.

Id: [0x002357B5]
Yes, simple enough. It needs to arrive in one piece.

Id: [0x002357B9]
Yes, that's it. He needs it soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002357BB]
Right. He'll be waiting for it.

Id: [0x002357BF]
Yes, you've got it. She needs it soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002357C1]
Yes, she must receive it. And soon.

Id: [0x002357C6]
Yes, he must remain unscathed.

Id: [0x002357C8]
Yes. Not a hand should touch him.

Id: [0x002357CA]
No harm can come to him.

Id: [0x002357CF]
Please, she must remain unscathed.

Id: [0x002357D1]
She must be kept safe. Should be easy enough for someone as strong as you.

Id: [0x002357D3]
No harm can come to her.

Id: [0x002357D6]
Yes, it must be investigated.

Yes, the Athenian commander must fall.

Id: [0x0023580C]
I want the bandit leader dead.

Id: [0x0023580E]
Yes, the bandit chief should die.

Id: [0x00235810]
Exactly. That bandit scum must be struck down.

Id: [0x0023581A]
That's exactly it. The mercenary must die.

Id: [0x0023581C]
I know it's a tall order, but I want this mercenary dead.

Id: [0x0023581E]
It's time for this mercenary to meet Hades.

Id: [0x00235826]
The death of the leader would solve everything.

Id: [0x00235828]
Yes. The leader must fall.

Id: [0x0023582A]
I know it's not an easy task, but the leader's death is the only solution.

Id: [0x0023582C]
Precisely. The leader must die.

Id: [0x00235837]
Yes, the wolf must be slain.

Id: [0x0023583C]
I understand this isn't an easy task, but the lion must be killed.

Id: [0x00235841]
I'm afraid this bear's death is the only solution. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00235846]
May the waters run red with the shark's blood.

Id: [0x0023584C]
Yes, every one of those forsaken pirates must be struck down.

Id: [0x0023584E]
That's it. Happy pirate hunting.

Id: [0x00235854]
No bandit should be left standing.

Id: [0x00235856]
All the bandits must die. Do we have an agreement?

Id: [0x0023585B]
All the soldiers must die. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x0023585D]
All the soldiers must die. It's the only way.

Id: [0x0023585F]
A few measly soldiers should be an easy mark for someone of your stature.

Id: [0x00235866]
Yes, those filthy Spartans must die.

Id: [0x00235868]
All the Spartans must be wiped out - every last one of them. Do you accept?

Id: [0x0023586F]
Yes. Every last one of these Athenians must die.

Id: [0x00235871]
Yes. All the Athenians must fall.

Id: [0x00235888]
Heracles got his start with goats, didn't you hear?

Id: [0x0023588A]
They might be bloodthirsty.

Id: [0x0023588C]
Very <i>angry</i> goats. [beat]Will you do it?

Id: [0x00235890]
Yes, these documents must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00235894]
Yes, the shrine must be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023589C]
Let it rot at the bottom of sea.

Id: [0x0023589E]
Yes, it must be sunk.

Id: [0x002358A0]
If it sinks, I'll rest easy.

Id: [0x002358A2]
May the sharks feast on the crew. Will you do it?

Id: [0x002358B1]
Yes, they all must sink. Do we have a deal, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x002358B3]
Exactly, my friend. The horizon must be cleared.

Id: [0x002358B5]
The horizon should be clear of ships once you're done.

Id: [0x002358B7]
All the boats must be sunk. Every. Last. One.

Id: [0x002358C7]
Yes, they must be starved out.

Id: [0x002358CB]
Yes, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x002358CF]
Exactly. Everything they have must be destroyed.

Id: [0x002358DF]
Exactly. I want that drachmae. All of it.

Id: [0x002358E1]
Yes, all the drachmae must be found.

Id: [0x002358E6]
Yes, you may need to get wet but... I need it back.

Id: [0x002358EC]
If the merchant receives it, I'll be in your debt.

Id: [0x002358EF]
Yes. Any drachmae you can give helps.

Id: [0x002358F2]
Yes, the location is yours... if you're willing to pay for it in drachmae.

Id: [0x0023599A]
Not exactly, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x0023599C]
No, I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x0023599E]
No. Killing him is the only way.

Id: [0x002359A0]
No, spill his blood.

Id: [0x002359A4]
No, I want you to slay the beast.

Id: [0x002359A6]
I'd rather you hunt the beast down.

Id: [0x002359AB]
No, I want you to kill her.

Id: [0x002359AD]
I was thinking of something bloodier. Kill her.

Id: [0x002359AF]
No, I want you to take her out.

Id: [0x002359B5]
No, I want you to kill them all.

Id: [0x002359B7]
Actually, I want a blood bath. Kill them all.

Id: [0x002359B9]
I had something bloodier in mind. Send them all to Hades.

Id: [0x002359BB]
No, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to slay them all.

Id: [0x002359BF]
No. Hunting the beasts down is the only answer. Make sure you get all of them.

Id: [0x002359C1]
No, I want you to hunt all the beasts down.

Id: [0x002359C4]
No, it needs to be destroyed.

Id: [0x002359C7]
No. Just destroy them all.

Id: [0x002359CA]
No, I just want you to set her free.

Id: [0x002359CD]
No, no. I just want you to find him and set him free.

Id: [0x002359D0]
No, I want you to free the beast.

Id: [0x002359D3]
No, I want you to bring it back.

Id: [0x002359D6]
In fact, I want you to bring me some.

Id: [0x002359D9]
No, just deliver it safely.

Id: [0x002359DC]
No, just bring this to him.

Id: [0x002359DF]
No, I just need this delivered to her.

Id: [0x002359E2]
No. The focus must be on protecting him at all costs.

Id: [0x002359E5]
No! Your job is to protect her.

Id: [0x002359E9]
No, sink the ship.

Id: [0x002359EB]
Not quite. I need you to destroy the boat.

Id: [0x002359EE]
No, the area must be investigated.

Id: [0x00235A03]
No, just slay the Follower.

Id: [0x00235A06]
No, slay the Daughter of Artemis.

Id: [0x00235A09]
No, all the Followers must die.

Id: [0x00235A0C]
No, all the Daughters Of Artemis must die.

Id: [0x00235A0F]
No, I just want you to give me some.

Id: [0x00235A14]
No, the Spartan commander must die.

Id: [0x00235A1A]
No, the Athenian commander must die.

Id: [0x00235A1E]
No. The bandit chief must die.

Id: [0x00235A25]
Not exactly. This mercenary needs to die.

Id: [0x00235A27]
No. This mercenary scum must die.

Id: [0x00235A2D]
No, I want you to assassinate the leader.

Id: [0x00235A2F]
Actually, I need the leader dead.

Id: [0x00235A36]
No. All the soldiers must be slain.

Id: [0x00235A3C]
No. All the Spartans must die.

Id: [0x00235A42]
No. All the Athenians must die.

Id: [0x00235A4E]
Well... no. I want you to slay all the goats.

Id: [0x00235A53]
No, the documents must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00235A57]
No. Destroy the shrine.

Id: [0x00235A64]
No, sink all the ships.

Id: [0x00235A66]
What I <i>want</i> is for you to bring your wrath to the sea and destroy all their ships.

Id: [0x00235A68]
Not strong enough. I want all their ships destroyed.

Id: [0x00235A76]
No, I want them to starve. Destroy their food.

Id: [0x00235A7B]
No, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00235A80]
No, destroy everything they have.

Id: [0x00235A89]
No, it must be returned to me. Even if you need to go diving.

Id: [0x00235A8F]
No, bring it to the merchant.

Id: [0x00235AAA]
No, I just need some drachmae.

Id: [0x00235AAD]
No, I'll give you the location... for a price.

Id: [0x00235ACB]
Thank you for saving me, dear child.

Id: [0x00235ACC]
By Zeus! What's with the size of the boars in this country?

Id: [0x00235AD0]
I've just got word the Athenian leader is dead. It's the sign we need. The gods want us to drive the Athenians back!

Id: [0x00235AE5]
She came and left Korinthia in a flurry, but made an impression on me. Like a great storm.

Id: [0x00235AEB]
What did they do?

Id: [0x00235AEC]
Gave her a running start. She can't go back there. They've set up camp, and they're armed and dangerous!

Id: [0x00235AED]
Interesting. Where is that farm?

Id: [0x00235AEE]
You! You’re the one who killed that false priestess, Chrysis! They say you carry out the will of the gods.

Id: [0x00235AF4]
As true priests say, "The gods don’t take kindly to people who abuse their powers."

Id: [0x00235AF5]
Exactly so! But Chrysis's evil isn't completely wiped out yet. There's a place nearby where some of her followers still gather. You can practically feel the evil when you get near it.

Id: [0x00235AF7]
Chrysis was evil. I tried to stop her. That's all.

Id: [0x00235AF8]
Well... Some of her followers are still around. I've seen them meeting at a shrine near here. I want them gone.

Id: [0x00235AFA]
What do her followers do?

Id: [0x00235AFB]
They visit their shrine to ask for curses. And when that doesn't work, they go out and harm innocents themselves.

Id: [0x00235AFD]
Family? Do you remember telling a Spartan family that their younger child must die? A grieving mother with eyes like mine?

Id: [0x00235AFE]
I am so sorry for what you have lost.

Id: [0x00235AFF]
Who wanted you kidnapped? These brutes didn't come up with the idea themselves.

Id: [0x00235B00]
Do not speak their name!

Id: [0x00235B01]
Did she tell you? Is she the oracle who brought ruin on your family?

Id: [0x00235B02]
I'm sorry for what I've done. I accept my punishment. But please, don't let my grandson kill me. Lykaon's a good man, a healer. This would break him.

Id: [0x00235B03]
No. She's my responsibility. I must be the one to end her.

Id: [0x00235B05]
Why did you spread lies? People trusted you. You were supposed to bring them the word of Apollo.

Id: [0x00235B06]
I didn't plan to, not when I was chosen to be the Oracle of Apollo. But I met people there who told me I must speak the words they asked. Or else my family would suffer for my disobedience.

Id: [0x00235B12]
That Spartan leader is finally dead. But those <i>malákes</i> soldiers who follow him... some of them still plague our land and sea. I want them all gone.

Id: [0x00235B23]
I'm traveling to curse our leader. He's stolen our offerings, calling it "tax." Such impiety, and it does so much harm to the poor we feed!

Id: [0x00235B24]
You must be very determined to come all this way for a curse. Why did you stop here?

Id: [0x00235B25]
I tried to go further, but there's wolves out there. I have nothing to fight them with. I'll never make it back to the temple alive.

Id: [0x00235B4C]
By Zeus, you'd do that for me?

Id: [0x00235B4E]
That's right.

Id: [0x00235B50]
That would be the plan.

Id: [0x00235B52]
Will you?

Id: [0x00235B54]
Yes. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x00235B56]
You read me like an oracle.

Id: [0x00235B58]
Yes, exactly.

Id: [0x00235B5A]
The glory is all yours if you accept. Do you?

Id: [0x00235B5C]
I beg you.

Id: [0x00235B5E]
The gods show me mercy. That is exactly what I desire.

Id: [0x00235B60]
That would be the idea, yes.

Id: [0x00235B62]
That would be ideal.

Id: [0x00235B64]
Are you up for it?

Id: [0x00235B66]
Exactly, my friend.

Id: [0x00235B68]
That's exactly it. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00235B6A]
It should be an easy task for someone with your talent.

Id: [0x00235B6C]
I would be in your debt.

Id: [0x00235B6E]
Then you understand.

Id: [0x00235B70]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x00235B72]
By the gods, you read my mind.

Id: [0x00235B74]
Obviously. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x00235B76]
Can I count on you?

Id: [0x00235B78]
I knew I asked the right person.

Id: [0x00235B7A]
That's exactly it. Will you do it for me?

Id: [0x00235B7C]
You understand perfectly, then.

Id: [0x00235B7E]
You understand quickly.

Id: [0x00235B80]
You catch on fast. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00235B82]
Ah. Not only do you possess the strength of Heracles, but the wits of Hermes, too.

Id: [0x00235C0E]
Yes. His death is the only answer.

Id: [0x00235C10]
Yes. He must die.

Id: [0x00235C12]
He must be struck down with all your strength.

Id: [0x00235C14]
Yes, his death will solve everything.

Id: [0x00235C16]
His blood must be spilled.

Id: [0x00235C18]
Exactly. He must be gutted.

Id: [0x00235C1A]
His blood should stain the earth.

Id: [0x00235C1C]
I can't hide my desires. He must die.

Id: [0x00235C1E]
His death is the only solution.

Id: [0x00235C27]
Yes, it must die.

Id: [0x00235C29]
That's right. It can't live.

Id: [0x00235C2B]
View this as a sacrifice to the gods.

Id: [0x00235C2D]
Of course! It must be put to rest.

Id: [0x00235C2F]
If your blade moves as fast as your mind, it doesn't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00235C31]
Exactly. It must die.

Id: [0x00235C33]
Yes. Its heart must stop.

Id: [0x00235C3B]
Please, she must die.

Id: [0x00235C3D]
Yes, I want her dead.

Id: [0x00235C3F]
Yes, she must go to Hades.

Id: [0x00235C41]
Yes, her time has come.

Id: [0x00235C43]
Her death is the only solution.

Id: [0x00235C45]
You have good instincts, <i>misthios</i>. I want her dead.

Id: [0x00235C4E]
You understand quickly. I need every last one to die.

Id: [0x00235C50]
Yes. None should be left standing.

Id: [0x00235C52]
Every last one of them must be slain.

Id: [0x00235C54]
That's right. I want them all dead.

Id: [0x00235C56]
All of them.

Id: [0x00235C58]
Yes, <i>misthios</i>. Each of them must die.

Id: [0x00235C5A]
Exactly. None should be left alive.

Id: [0x00235C5E]
Yes, all of them must die.

Id: [0x00235C60]
Yes, all of them must be gutted. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00235C67]
Exactly. Nothing should be left of it.

Id: [0x00235C69]
Yes, it must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x00235C6B]
You know your craft. Leave no trace.

Id: [0x00235C6D]
Nothing should be left of it. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00235C6F]
By Apollo, you understand. It needs to disappear.

Id: [0x00235C75]
Exactly. Every last one of them.

Id: [0x00235C77]
Yes, they all must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x00235C79]
No need to speak more. All must disappear.

Id: [0x00235C7B]
Nothing should be left. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00235C82]
By the gods, you understand. She must go free.

Id: [0x00235C84]
Not an easy task but yes, she must escape.

Id: [0x00235C86]
Yes, please. She must be rescued.

Id: [0x00235C88]
Exactly. She must go free.

Id: [0x00235C8A]
I would be forever in your debt if she is freed.

Id: [0x00235C91]
By the gods, yes. He must be rescued.

Id: [0x00235C93]
Not an easy task, but yes, I want him out of there.

Id: [0x00235C95]
He must walk free.

Id: [0x00235C97]
Please make sure he gets out of there safely.

Id: [0x00235C99]
I would be forever in your debt if he were saved.

Id: [0x00235C9C]
By the gods, yes. The creature must go free.

Id: [0x00235CA2]
Yes, I need it back at all costs.

Id: [0x00235CA4]
Yes, it needs to be returned without a scratch.

Id: [0x00235CA6]
By the gods, I need it back. In one piece, please.

Id: [0x00235CA8]
Simple enough. I need it back in good shape.

Id: [0x00235CAE]
Yes, any you can bring me will help.

Id: [0x00235CB0]
Yes, I'll take any you can find.

Id: [0x00235CB2]
By the gods, yes. Any will help.

Id: [0x00235CB4]
Simple enough. Any you can find will help.

Id: [0x00235CBA]
Exactly. It must arrive without a scratch.

Id: [0x00235CBC]
Yes, it needs to get there in one piece.

Id: [0x00235CBE]
You got it. The job will be finished once it arrives.

Id: [0x00235CC0]
Yes, simple enough. It needs to arrive in one piece.

Id: [0x00235CC4]
Yes, that's it. He needs it soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00235CC6]
Right. He'll be waiting for it.

Id: [0x00235CCA]
Yes, you've got it. She needs it soon, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00235CCC]
Yes, she must receive it. And soon.

Id: [0x00235CD1]
Yes, he must remain unscathed.

Id: [0x00235CD3]
Yes. Not a hand should touch him.

Id: [0x00235CD5]
No harm can come to him.

Id: [0x00235CDA]
Please, she must remain unscathed.

Id: [0x00235CDC]
She must be kept safe. Should be easy enough for someone as strong as you.

Id: [0x00235CDE]
No harm can come to her.

Id: [0x00235CE1]
Yes, it must be investigated.

Id: [0x00235D27]
I know it's a tall order, but I want this mercenary dead.

Id: [0x00235D29]
It's time for this mercenary to meet Hades.

Id: [0x00235D31]
The death of the leader would solve everything.

Id: [0x00235D33]
Yes. The leader must fall.

Id: [0x00235D35]
I know it's not an easy task, but the leader's death is the only solution.

I guess that makes sense.

Id: [0x002365C1]
I'm thrilled you approve. [beat]You'll need to bring me the seals of the commanders you kill, as proof. You'll be amply rewarded.

Then you understand.

Well, yes.

Id: [0x00236B99]
By the gods, you read my mind.

View this as a sacrifice to the gods.

Id: [0x00236C54]
Of course! It must be put to rest.

Id: [0x00236C56]
If your blade moves as fast as your mind, it doesn't stand a chance.

Id: [0x00236C58]
Exactly. It must die.

Yes, they all must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x00236CA0]
No need to speak more. All must disappear.

Id: [0x00236CA2]
Nothing should be left. Do you accept?

Id: [0x00236CA9]
By the gods, you understand. She must go free.

Id: [0x00236CAB]
Not an easy task but yes, she must escape.

Id: [0x00236CAD]
Yes, please. She must be rescued.

Id: [0x00236CAF]

Exactly. That bandit scum must be struck down.

Id: [0x00236D4C]
That's exactly it. The mercenary must die.

Id: [0x00236D4E]
I know it's a tall order, but I want this mercenary dead.

Id: [0x00236D50]
It's time for this mercenary to meet Hades.

Id: [0x00236D58]
The death of the leader would solve everything.

Id: [0x00236D5A]
Yes. The leader must fall.

May the waters run red with the shark's blood.

Id: [0x00236D7E]
Yes, every one of those forsaken pirates must be struck down.

May the sharks feast on the crew. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00236DE3]
Yes, they all must sink. Do we have a deal, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00236DE5]
Exactly, my friend. The horizon must be cleared.

Id: [0x00236DE7]
The horizon should be clear of ships once you're done.

Id: [0x00236EE7]
No, I want you to kill them all.

Id: [0x00236EED]
No, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to slay them all.

Id: [0x00236FDC]
No, I just need some drachmae.

Id: [0x00236FDF]
No, I'll give you the location... for a price.

Id: [0x00236FE5]
There's one. All the marble in Mykonos can't save you from my spear.

Id: [0x00236FE9]
Found you. Death has, too.

Id: [0x00236FED]
There he is, hiding in plain sight.

Id: [0x0023700D]
By Zeus, you'd do that for me?

Id: [0x0023700F]
That's right.

Id: [0x00237011]
That would be the plan.

It should be an easy task for someone with your talent.

Then you understand.

That's exactly it. The mercenary must die.

Id: [0x002391E4]
I know it's a tall order, but I want this mercenary dead.

Id: [0x002391E6]
It's time for this mercenary to meet Hades.

Id: [0x002391EE]
The death of the leader would solve everything.

Id: [0x002391F0]
Yes. The leader must fall.

Id: [0x002391F2]
I know it's not an easy task, but the leader's death is the only solution.

Id: [0x002391F4]
Precisely. The leader must die.

Id: [0x002391FF]
Yes, the wolf must be slain.

Id: [0x00239204]
I understand this isn't an easy task, but the lion must be killed.

Id: [0x00239209]
I'm afraid this bear's death is the only solution. Do you accept?

Id: [0x0023920E]
May the waters run red with the shark's blood.

Id: [0x00239214]
Yes, every one of those forsaken pirates must be struck down.

That's it. Happy pirate hunting.

Yes. Every last one of these Athenians must die.

Id: [0x00239239]
Yes. All the Athenians must fall.

Very <i>angry</i> goats. [beat]Will you do it?

Id: [0x00239268]
If it sinks, I'll rest easy.

Id: [0x0023926A]
May the sharks feast on the crew. Will you do it?

Id: [0x00239279]
Yes, they all must sink. Do we have a deal, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023927B]
Exactly, my friend. The horizon must be cleared.

Id: [0x0023927D]
The horizon should be clear of ships once you're done.

Id: [0x0023927F]
All the boats must be sunk. Every. Last. One.

Id: [0x0023928F]
Yes, they must be starved out.

Id: [0x00239293]
Yes, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x00239297]
Exactly. Everything they have must be destroyed.

Id: [0x002392A7]
Exactly. I want that drachmae. All of it.

Id: [0x002392A9]
Yes, all the drachmae must be found.

Id: [0x002392AE]
Yes, you may need to get wet but... I need it back.

Id: [0x002392B4]
If the merchant receives it, I'll be in your debt.

Id: [0x002392B7]
Yes. Any drachmae you can give helps.

Id: [0x002392BA]
Yes, the location is yours... if you're willing to pay for it in drachmae.

Id: [0x00239362]
Not exactly, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x00239364]
No, I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x00239366]
No. Killing him is the only way.

Id: [0x00239368]
No, spill his blood.

Id: [0x0023936C]
No, I want you to slay the beast.

Id: [0x0023936E]
I'd rather you hunt the beast down.

Id: [0x00239373]
No, I want you to kill her.

Id: [0x00239375]
I was thinking of something bloodier. Kill her.

Id: [0x00239377]
No, I want you to take her out.

Id: [0x0023937D]
No, I want you to kill them all.

Id: [0x0023937F]
Actually, I want a blood bath. Kill them all.

Id: [0x00239381]
I had something bloodier in mind. Send them all to Hades.

Id: [0x00239383]
No, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to slay them all.

Id: [0x00239387]
No. Hunting the beasts down is the only answer. Make sure you get all of them.

Id: [0x00239389]
No, I want you to hunt all the beasts down.

Id: [0x0023938C]
No, it needs to be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023938F]
No. Just destroy them all.

Id: [0x00239392]
No, I just want you to set her free.

Id: [0x00239395]
No, no. I just want you to find him and set him free.

Id: [0x00239398]
No, I want you to free the beast.

Id: [0x0023939B]
No, I want you to bring it back.

Id: [0x0023939E]
In fact, I want you to bring me some.

Id: [0x002393A1]
No, just deliver it safely.

Id: [0x002393A4]
No, just bring this to him.

Id: [0x002393A7]
No, I just need this delivered to her.

Id: [0x002393AA]
No. The focus must be on protecting him at all costs.

Id: [0x002393AD]
No! Your job is to protect her.

Id: [0x002393B1]
No, sink the ship.

Id: [0x002393B3]
Not quite. I need you to destroy the boat.

Id: [0x002393B6]
No, the area must be investigated.

Id: [0x002393CB]
No, just slay the Follower.

Id: [0x002393E6]

Id: [0x002393ED]
Not exactly. This mercenary needs to die.

Id: [0x002393EF]
No. This mercenary scum must die.

Id: [0x002393F5]

What I <i>want</i> is for you to bring your wrath to the sea and destroy all their ships.

Id: [0x00239430]
Not strong enough. I want all their ships destroyed.

Id: [0x0023943E]

Id: [0x00239457]
No, bring it to the merchant.

Id: [0x00239472]
No, I just need some drachmae.

Id: [0x00239475]
No, I'll give you the location... for a price.

Id: [0x0023947B]
Thought you could hide on Delos... Found you, coward.

Id: [0x00239DAC]
When the people of Delos discover Podarkes lost every coin of their nation's treasure, they're going to rip him to pieces!

Id: [0x00239DAD]
You've weakened Athens's grip over Delos, exposed Podarkes, and made way for a Spartan alliance. I could kiss you!

Id: [0x00239DAE]
I have a surprise. The treasury was already looted... by me. I'm surprised the soldiers haven't already ripped Podarkes to pieces!

Id: [0x0023A261]
By Zeus, you'd do that for me?

Id: [0x0023A263]
That's right.

Id: [0x0023A265]
That would be the plan.

You read me like an oracle.

Yes, exactly.

Id: [0x0023A26F]
The glory is all yours if you accept. Do you?

Id: [0x0023A271]
I beg you.

Id: [0x0023A273]
The gods show me mercy. That is exactly what I desire.

Id: [0x0023A275]
That would be the idea, yes.

Id: [0x0023A277]
That would be ideal.

Id: [0x0023A279]
Are you up for it?

Id: [0x0023A27B]
Exactly, my friend.

Id: [0x0023A27D]
That's exactly it. Will you do it?

Id: [0x0023A27F]
It should be an easy task for someone with your talent.

Id: [0x0023A281]
I would be in your debt.

Id: [0x0023A283]
Then you understand.

Id: [0x0023A285]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x0023A287]
By the gods, you read my mind.

Id: [0x0023A289]
Obviously. Do we have a deal?

Id: [0x0023A28B]
Can I count on you?

Id: [0x0023A28D]
I knew I asked the right person.

Id: [0x0023A28F]
That's exactly it. Will you do it for me?

Id: [0x0023A291]
You understand perfectly, then.

Id: [0x0023A293]
You understand quickly.

Id: [0x0023A295]
You catch on fast. Will you do it?

Id: [0x0023A297]
Ah. Not only do you possess the strength of Herakles, but the wits of Hermes, too.

Id: [0x0023A323]
Yes. His death is the only answer.

Id: [0x0023A325]
Yes. He must die.

Id: [0x0023A327]
He must be struck down with all your strength.

His blood should stain the earth.

Id: [0x0023A331]
I can't hide my desires. He must die.

His death is the only solution.

Id: [0x0023A33C]
Yes, it must die.

Id: [0x0023A33E]
That's right. It can't live.

Id: [0x0023A340]
View this as a sacrifice to the gods.

Id: [0x0023A342]
Of course! It must be put to rest.

Id: [0x0023A344]
If your blade moves as fast as your mind, it doesn't stand a chance.

Id: [0x0023A346]
Exactly. It must die.

Id: [0x0023A348]
Yes. Its heart must stop.

Id: [0x0023A350]
Please, she must die.

Id: [0x0023A352]
Yes, I want her dead.

Yes, she must go to Hades.

Id: [0x0023A356]
Yes, her time has come.

Id: [0x0023A358]
Her death is the only solution.

Id: [0x0023A35A]
You have good instincts, <i>misthios</i>. I want her dead.

Id: [0x0023A380]
You know your craft. Leave no trace.

Id: [0x0023A382]
Nothing should be left of it. Do you accept?

Id: [0x0023A384]
By Apollo, you understand. It needs to disappear.

Id: [0x0023A38A]
Exactly. Every last one of them.

Id: [0x0023A38C]
Yes, they all must be turned to dust.

Id: [0x0023A38E]
No need to speak more. All must disappear.

Id: [0x0023A390]
Nothing should be left. Do you accept?

Id: [0x0023A397]
By the gods, you understand. She must go free.

If it sinks, I'll rest easy.

Id: [0x0023A4C2]
May the sharks feast on the crew. Will you do it?

Id: [0x0023A4D1]
Yes, they all must sink. Do we have a deal, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023A4D3]
Exactly, my friend. The horizon must be cleared.

Id: [0x0023A4D5]
The horizon should be clear of ships once you're done.

Id: [0x0023A4D7]
All the boats must be sunk. Every. Last. One.

Id: [0x0023A4E7]
Yes, they must be starved out.

Id: [0x0023A4EB]
Yes, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023A4EF]
Exactly. Everything they have must be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023A4FF]
Exactly. I want that drachmae. All of it.

Id: [0x0023A501]
Yes, all the drachmae must be found.

Id: [0x0023A506]
Yes, you may need to get wet but... I need it back.

Id: [0x0023A50C]
If the merchant receives it, I'll be in your debt.

Id: [0x0023A50F]
Yes. Any drachmae you can give helps.

Id: [0x0023A512]
Yes, the location is yours... if you're willing to pay for it in drachmae.

Id: [0x0023A5BA]
Not exactly, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x0023A5BC]
No, I want you to kill him.

Id: [0x0023A5BE]
No. Killing him is the only way.

Id: [0x0023A5C0]
No, spill his blood.

Id: [0x0023A5C4]
No, I want you to slay the beast.

Id: [0x0023A5C6]
I'd rather you hunt the beast down.

Id: [0x0023A5CB]
No, I want you to kill her.

Id: [0x0023A5CD]
I was thinking of something bloodier. Kill her.

Id: [0x0023A5CF]
No, I want you to take her out.

Id: [0x0023A5D5]
No, I want you to kill them all.

Id: [0x0023A5D7]
Actually, I want a blood bath. Kill them all.

Id: [0x0023A5D9]
I had something bloodier in mind. Send them all to Hades.

Id: [0x0023A5DB]
No, <i>misthios</i>. I want you to slay them all.

Id: [0x0023A5DF]
No. Hunting the beasts down is the only answer. Make sure you get all of them.

Id: [0x0023A5E1]
No, I want you to hunt all the beasts down.

Id: [0x0023A5E4]
No, it needs to be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023A5E7]
No. Just destroy them all.

Id: [0x0023A5EA]
No, I just want you to set her free.

Id: [0x0023A5ED]
No, no. I just want you to find him and set him free.

Id: [0x0023A5F0]
No, I want you to free the beast.

Id: [0x0023A5F3]
No, I want you to bring it back.

Id: [0x0023A5F6]
In fact, I want you to bring me some.

Id: [0x0023A5F9]
No, just deliver it safely.

Id: [0x0023A5FC]
No, just bring this to him.

Id: [0x0023A5FF]
No, I just need this delivered to her.

Id: [0x0023A602]
No. The focus must be on protecting him at all costs.

Id: [0x0023A605]
No! Your job is to protect her.

Id: [0x0023A609]
No, sink the ship.

Id: [0x0023A60B]
Not quite. I need you to destroy the boat.

Id: [0x0023A60E]
No, the area must be investigated.

Id: [0x0023A623]
No, just slay the Follower.

Id: [0x0023A626]
No, slay the Daughter of Artemis.

Id: [0x0023A629]
No, all the Followers must die.

Id: [0x0023A62C]
No, all the Daughters of Artemis must die.

Id: [0x0023A62F]
No, I just want you to give me some.

Id: [0x0023A634]
No, the Spartan commander must die.

Id: [0x0023A63A]
No, the Athenian commander must die.

Id: [0x0023A63E]
No. The bandit chief must die.

Id: [0x0023A645]
Not exactly. This mercenary needs to die.

Id: [0x0023A647]
No. This mercenary scum must die.

Id: [0x0023A64D]
No, I want you to assassinate the leader.

Id: [0x0023A64F]
Actually, I need the leader dead.

Id: [0x0023A656]
No. All the soldiers must be slain.

Id: [0x0023A65C]
No. All the Spartans must die.

Id: [0x0023A662]
No. All the Athenians must die.

Id: [0x0023A66E]
Well... no. I want you to slay all the goats.

Id: [0x0023A673]
No, the documents must be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023A677]
No. Destroy the shrine.

Id: [0x0023A684]
No, sink all the ships.

Id: [0x0023A686]
What I <i>want</i> is for you to bring your wrath to the sea and destroy all their ships.

Id: [0x0023A688]
Not strong enough. I want all their ships destroyed.

Id: [0x0023A696]
No, I want them to starve. Destroy their food.

Id: [0x0023A69B]
No, their weapons must be destroyed.

Id: [0x0023A6A0]
No, destroy everything they have.

Id: [0x0023A6A9]
No, it must be returned to me. Even if you need to go diving.

Id: [0x0023A6AF]
No, bring it to the merchant.

Id: [0x0023A6CA]
No, I just need some drachmae.

Id: [0x0023A6CD]
No, I'll give you the location... for a price.

Id: [0x0023A6E1]
Just go. <i>Go away!</i>

Id: [0x0023A6E4]
The witch is crazy, but she did what you tried to do. Anything and everything to be with the one she loves. I can't fault her.

Id: [0x0023A6E9]
What -

Id: [0x0023A6EA]
[&cry]Misthios! Kill this snake!

Id: [0x0023A6EB]
She did this to me! She made me bald!

Id: [0x0023A6EC]
She set me up! Aetios picked her instead.

Id: [0x0023A6ED]
H-he didn't even take a second look at me...

Id: [0x0023A6EF]
You said "a little bit" of her hair. Explain this.

Id: [0x0023A6F4]
Explain? It's clear.

Id: [0x0023A6F5]
Beautiful, <i>gullible</i>, idiot girl falls prey to -

Id: [0x0023A6F6]
Her competition.

Id: [0x0023A6F7]
Why would you do such a thing?

Id: [0x0023A6F8]
Aetios can be no one's but mine. I'm the one who truly loves him. I grew up with him.

Id: [0x0023A6F9]
You think I'd let some starry-eyed fledgling after his wealth steal the love of my life from me?

Id: [0x0023A6FB]
Aetios... doesn't know what's good for him. He's been eyeing this one for a while now.

Id: [0x0023A6FC]
He liked the way she looked.

Id: [0x0023A6FD]
So, I changed that.

Id: [0x0023A6FF]
I've always been the one looking out for him!

Id: [0x0023A704]
What happened to the potion?

Id: [0x0023A705]
Why, she drank it! And look! It worked <i>wonderfully.</i>

Id: [0x0023A706]
A spell? Are you idiots? If only something so convenient existed.

Id: [0x0023A70F]
This is the Fertile Battleground region.

Id: [0x0023A714]
This is the region of Octopus Bay.<LF>

Id: [0x0023A716]
I was promised drachmae. Just give it to me. I didn't sign up for any of this drama.

Id: [0x0023A717]
Technically the girl asked you for the items, not me.

Id: [0x0023A71A]
She's making fools of us both! Kill her, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0023A71E]
The Minos's Legacy region. The fort must be close by.

Id: [0x0023A723]
The Minos's Legacy region. I'm on the right track.

Id: [0x0023A728]
There it is. Knossos Palace.

Id: [0x0023A734]
How could you say that after what she did to me?

Id: [0x0023A735]
Know when you are beat. Go home.

Id: [0x0023A73E]
You're crazy, you'll pay for this.

Id: [0x0023A73F]
She played the game and she lost. There's nothing to pay for.

Id: [0x0023A741]
Please, <i>misthios</i>... do something.

Id: [0x0023A742]
I'll cut through every last one of your guards to get to you.

Id: [0x0023A743]
Guards! Stop this <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0023A744]
Guards! There's a witch in our midst!

Id: [0x0023A748]
Octopus Bay. The Priestess said the cave was along the shoreline to the east.

Id: [0x0023A74C]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0023A74F]
The <i>misthios</i> speaks the truth! Look what she did to me. She poisoned me and made me hideous. Someone please help!

Id: [0x0023A750]
Ugh! You watch your back, <i>misthios</i>. I'll have your head.

Id: [0x0023A754]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>... for everything.

Id: [0x0023A75C]
But I'll also need an axe, one that only a Minotaur - <i>or a Minotaur slayer!</i> - would wield.  Will you help me?

Id: [0x0023A75E]
But I still need the Leader's armor. It'll make me look like, you know, a Leader. Will you help me?

Id: [0x0023A75F]
I can't do this without you, <i>misthios</i>. I need the love potion.

Id: [0x0023A764]
Ah, Dikte Plateau. The one place in Pephka I might just be safe from scams.

Id: [0x0023A76C]
Lot of warriors - must be the Warrior's Rest.

Id: [0x0023A771]
The city of Lato. Better keep a close eye on my drachmae.

Id: [0x0023A776]
Warrior's Rest. Leiandros said the other warriors ready to face the Minotaur would be here.

Id: [0x0023A77F]
The Cave of the Brave. Let's put that name to the test.

Id: [0x0023A787]
Hmm... Hmmmmmmmm. Oh! No, no, no. But what if - ooooooooooh! Oh. Argh, no, no, no. Hmm...

Id: [0x0023A78C]
Dikte Plateau. Leiandros said some warriors would be heading through here.

Id: [0x0023A792]
Dikte Plateau. The old ruins of Zakros are around here somewhere.

Id: [0x0023A799]
This is the armor Morys described. [beat]It <i>is </i>shiny.

Id: [0x0023A79E]
Hmm. Pephka's Leader has strange taste in armor.

Id: [0x0023A7A3]
Ah, now <i>this </i>is the perfect axe for Morys.

Id: [0x0023A7A8]
Strange axe... Better keep it.

Id: [0x0023A7B1]
There it is. Zakros. Amara is being held hostage here.

Id: [0x0023A7BE]
I need to know if your school[2400848] has a connection to the disappearances.

Id: [0x0023A7C1]
Not if I cut the answers from your throat first.

Id: [0x0023A7C6]
Aphrodite’s Watch. The Murex Fort is around here.

Id: [0x0023A7C8]
Sounds like you're backing down.

Id: [0x0023A7DD]
Sounds like you could use some Minotaur Hoof Elixir.

Id: [0x0023A7E0]
[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs] No, no, no, only a fool would buy such a blatant scam! [&laughs]"Minotaur Hoof Elixir"! Why would a Minotaur need elixir for its hooves?!

Id: [0x0023A7E2]
I'd rather not hurt the students. Maybe we could arrange something with drachmae?

Id: [0x0023A7E3]
Since I'm the Olympic champion, shouldn't I train your students instead? I'm sure they agree that I'm better qualified.

Id: [0x0023A7EC]
There's the Murex Camp.

Id: [0x0023A807]
The man with Empedokles’s purple robe should be along this road.

Id: [0x0023A812]
There it is. The Agora. <LF>

Id: [0x0023A81D]
The Murex Dyeing Facility. The man frequents these docks.

Id: [0x0023A832]
Phokis nation. I should check the islands south of here.

Id: [0x0023A83A]
What's a little girl doing in a clay pit?

Id: [0x0023A83B]
Ooh! A misthios!

Id: [0x0023A83C]
Hi, <i>misthios</i>! I'm just preparing something for my friends.

Id: [0x0023A83D]
I've been here <i>allllllllll</i> day, but I still need more clay! I need enough for all of them.

Id: [0x0023A841]
The Gulf of Korinth. The island should be here.

Id: [0x0023A843]
What you're doing for your friends is very nice. I'm sure they'll appreciate it.

Id: [0x0023A844]
Really? You think so?

Id: [0x0023A845]
I was thinking of getting them some other things though.

Id: [0x0023A846]
You friends will be upset with you for giving them dirt.

Id: [0x0023A847]
Silly misthios! I'm not going to give this to them. I have other things in mind to give them.

Id: [0x0023A848]
You're a generous friend. What do you want to give them?

Id: [0x0023A849]
I want to give them some nice goo-werry.

Id: [0x0023A84A]
You mean jewelry?

Id: [0x0023A84B]
That's what I said!

Id: [0x0023A84D]
You don't look like you could afford any, honestly.

Id: [0x0023A851]
There it is. The cave.

Id: [0x0023A853]
I know! That's why I was going to get some shiny stones in the Abandoned Mines and a few pearls from the lagoon[2400870].

Id: [0x0023A857]
This must be the island that Empedokles mentioned.

Id: [0x0023A859]
But I've been stuck here all day with the clay! And the Abandoned Mines are kinda scary...

Id: [0x0023A85A]
Do you think you could help me get some gifts for my friends? It'd make them happy, and that'd make me happy!

Id: [0x0023A85B]
Gladly, young lady. I'll see to it you get the best pearls and shiny stones.

Id: [0x0023A85C]
Yay! Thank you! You're really nice for a big, scary-looking person.

Id: [0x0023A863]
The Agora. The merchant said tensions were high here.

Id: [0x0023A864]
These pearls you talked about. Where can I find them?

Id: [0x0023A865]
North of the claypits! In the lagooooooon[2400870]! They're just sitting there in the water, but there are some biiiiig sharks in there. Be careful!

Id: [0x0023A866]
Where are these Abandoned Mines with your shiny stones?

Id: [0x0023A867]
The mine is in the meadow! West of the temple[2378806].

Id: [0x0023A868]
I'll see what I can find.

Id: [0x0023A869]
Where are all your friends?

Id: [0x0023A86A]
...They'll be coming soon. Just a little longer.

Id: [0x0023A86B]
Speak up, child, I can't hear you.

Id: [0x0023A86C]
Never mind! I'll introduce you to them later!

Id: [0x0023A86E]
Yay! I knew you'd come back! Can you help me gather gifts for my friends?

Id: [0x0023A86F]
Welcome back, <i>misthios</i>! Did you need something?

Id: [0x0023A870]
I'm sorry, child. I have other things to see to.

Id: [0x0023A871]
O-oh, OK. Come back if you change your mind, OK?

Id: [0x0023A872]
OK, that's all I need to know. I'll see you later.

Id: [0x0023A873]
I should be done here soon! Meet me at the cliff overlooking the lagoon[2400870], OK? I'll introduce you to my friends. Thanks, misthios!

Id: [0x0023A878]
This is the lagoon[2400870] the little girl mentioned.

Id: [0x0023A87D]
That's enough pearls.

Id: [0x0023A882]
The Abandoned Mines with the shiny stones.

Id: [0x0023A887]
These weren't too hard to find.

Id: [0x0023A88E]
The little girl and her friends. She got here sooner than I thought she would.

Id: [0x0023A892]
<i>Misthios</i>! You made it just in time. My friends have finally arrived.

Id: [0x0023A893]
I... don't see anyone else here but us.

Id: [0x0023A894]
What? Silly <i>misthios</i>, can't you see them? They're right over there.

Id: [0x0023A896]
The one on the left is Theo, and the one on the right is Airla!

Id: [0x0023A898]
They look... friendly, but I don't think they really count as your friends.

Id: [0x0023A899]
Your friends?! They're made of clay! How can they be your friends?

Id: [0x0023A89A]
What do you mean? They're my friends. I made them.

Id: [0x0023A89B]
I know you made them, but that -

Id: [0x0023A89C]
<i>Mater</i> told me to make friends, <i>misthios</i>. A-and I did.

Id: [0x0023A89D]
This isn't the way to make friends. Tell your <i>mater</i> -

Id: [0x0023A89E]
I can't.

Id: [0x0023A8A0]
<i>Mater</i> is dead.

Id: [0x0023A8A2]
She joined the pirates - told me she'll bring back so much drachmae, we could swim in it!

Id: [0x0023A8A3]
But... I've never had any friends. I didn't know what she meant. So I thought really, reaaaaaaaally hard, and made my friends out of clay.

Id: [0x0023A8A4]
Did I make a mistake?

Id: [0x0023A8A5]
<i>Mater</i> won't be upset at me right? I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!

Id: [0x0023A8A7]
No, child, no. You did great. Your <i>mater</i> would be proud of you. Friends come in all shapes and sizes.

Id: [0x0023A8A8]
I have an eagle, and he's a close friend of mine.

Id: [0x0023A8A9]
Wow, really? That's so cool...

Id: [0x0023A8AA]
Here you go, your gifts for your friends, as promised. Why don't you go put them on for them? I'm sure they'll like that.

Id: [0x0023A8AB]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! You're the best! I'll go do that right now!

Id: [0x0023A8AC]
You can't do this anymore.

Id: [0x0023A8AE]
W-what are you doing? Those are for my friends!

Id: [0x0023A8AF]
They are <i>not </i>your friends! "They" are lumps of <i>clay</i>!

Id: [0x0023A8B1]
You need to make <i>real</i> friends. Go into the towns, find children your age. You cannot live out here alone.

Id: [0x0023A8B2]
But all the townsfolk told me to stay away... They say I'm a cursed girl.

Id: [0x0023A8B3]
Then go somewhere else, find other people. There are still good people left -

Id: [0x0023A8B4]
You just don't get it! You're not me! You don't understand...

Id: [0x0023A8BE]
You're not real. You're not real. You're not real! Just you wait, I'll make some <i>real </i>friends.

Id: [0x0023A8C1]
Look at the pretty pearls and stones! Which would you like, Theo? I think the stones suit you better! Airla can get the pearls. They're pretty, just like her!

Id: [0x0023A8C6]
This eastern market is a place I should check out. <LF>

Id: [0x0023A8CB]
The merchant mentioned there was unrest at these docks. I should look into it.

Id: [0x0023A8D1]
The Little Egypt region. Kydonia should be close.

Id: [0x0023A8D6]
Zeus’s Playground. The Followers of Ares live in caves within this region.

Id: [0x0023A8DD]
There's a cave here. I wonder if the Followers of Ares are inside?

Id: [0x0023A8E2]
This cave might belong to the Followers of Ares. I should check it out.

Id: [0x0023A8EF]
These must be the Dread Ruins Bryce spoke of.

Id: [0x0023A8F8]
Ah. The Petrified Temple.

Id: [0x0023A907]
I found a note that mentioned this place. And you. It called for fighters from all over the Greek world.

Id: [0x0023A90E]
The Petrified Valley. The temple must be around here.

Id: [0x0023A916]
The Dread Ruins. Appropriately named.

Id: [0x0023A91C]
The Petrified Temple... Best be cautious.

Id: [0x0023A926]
The Petrified Valley. Must be close to the Petrified Temple.

Id: [0x0023A935]
The Vineyard Canyon. Bryce said the Huntress Village is somewhere in this region.

Id: [0x0023A93A]
The Huntress Village. I'll need to be ready for anything.

Id: [0x0023A93E]
I'll fight this King of the Bandits.

Id: [0x0023A940]
I will spear Belos like a wild animal.

Id: [0x0023A942]
I'll hunt Evanthe in the arena.

Id: [0x0023A947]
The Rock from Athens is about to be crushed.

Id: [0x0023A94B]
Vasilis will have devoured his last opponent.

Id: [0x0023A95F]
The Dread Ruins. Not my first choice for a love nest.

Id: [0x0023A965]
There it is. The Petrified Temple.

Id: [0x0023A96A]
The Petrified Valley. The temple will be somewhere in this region.

Id: [0x0023A971]
Choose your opponent.

Id: [0x0023A975]
If you've come to enroll in my school[2400848], I'm afraid you're at<i> least</i> ten years too late.

Id: [0x0023A97B]
The axe is here.

Id: [0x0023A97C]
Shame.

Id: [0x0023A984]
Better unemployed than dead.

Id: [0x0023A98C]
I'll do my part. Consider the commanders already dead.

Id: [0x0023A992]
Maybe later. I'll return if I have time.

Id: [0x0023A9B2]
Some enemy commanders remain. Go to the forts and kill them to clear the way. Ready?

Id: [0x0023A9B5]
Excellent. Our ineffectual leaders will see my value.

Id: [0x0023A9E0]
Here? Before the gods?

Id: [0x0023A9E1]
Let's make an <i>offering</i>.

Id: [0x0023A9E4]
I'd like to see the gods stop us.

Id: [0x0023A9E5]
I have a feeling they'd prefer to watch.

Id: [0x0023A9E6]
I'd say we gave the gods a good show.

Id: [0x0023A9E7]
I couldn't agree more. I'd love an encore soon.

Id: [0x0023A9E9]
I'm not interested.

Id: [0x0023A9EA]
A shame... Aphrodite would have loved it. Maybe another time.

Id: [0x0023AAC4]
If you don't finish this, Lykaon, you won't be able to live with yourself. Go on, kill her.

Id: [0x0023AAC7]
Probably. But you didn't have to. You get to be the honorable healer. I'm the <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x0023AAC8]
You didn't have to, I could have done it.

Id: [0x0023AAC9]
I do what I do. Nothing more, nothing less.

Id: [0x0023AB0B]
The size of it... That's no ordinary wolf!

Id: [0x0023AB13]
Thank you for helping with my grandmother. I'm not sure I can ever forgive her, but we must both get past her lies.

Id: [0x0023AB16]
I still can't believe you killed my grandmother. I should have stopped you and done it myself.

Id: [0x0023AB26]
I've never seen such a monster! This beast isn't even native to these lands.

Id: [0x0023AB38]
Such a noble creature. The gods themselves will be envious of this hunt.

Id: [0x0023AB3E]
I don't pretend to know the thoughts of the gods, but I'm happy to guide your son.

Id: [0x0023ABB7]
Look at that. Father of the Minotaur.

Id: [0x0023ABB9]
Did you hear? Someone's raided the local treasury. The fort is in chaos.

Id: [0x0023ABBA]
Oh... that. Listen, if those riches were so important, they should've been harder to steal.

Id: [0x0023ABBB]
Don't be so modest, hero. I know it was you. With both sides in the conflict scrambling to figure out what happened, we can strike.

Id: [0x0023ABBC]
Strike? You're... a priestess.

Id: [0x0023ABBD]
I am a servant of the gods. Soldiers bring war, and war brings impurity. It's time we cleanse these lands of their presence.

Id: [0x0023ABC0]
[&laughs]Many things...

Id: [0x0023ABC6]
Kyra's skills with the blade started young.

Id: [0x0023ABC8]
And <i>you're</i> Kyra's hope for the rebellion? Gods help us all!

Id: [0x0023ABCA]
What?

Id: [0x0023ABCB]
Unbelievable! If the child belonged to Podarkes, and the child is Kyra, then that would make...

Id: [0x0023ABCC]
By Zeus! Podarkes is Kyra's <i>pater</i>!

Id: [0x0023ABD7]
I hope you don't make me wait too long to see your face again...

Id: [0x0023ABDA]
Very wise, <i>misthios.</i> Very wise indeed.

Id: [0x0023ABE3]
I should get this pelt back to Daphnae at the temple.

Id: [0x0023ABE5]
The dust in there gave me a headache. Just tell me.

Id: [0x0023ABE7]
A bandit chief and his thugs are overrunning this area. They abducted our priest and are holding him ransom.

Id: [0x0023ABEE]
By Ares, we'll slice you right open.

Id: [0x0023ABEF]
That's what I get for sparing you? No manners.

Id: [0x0023ABF1]
There she is! Get her!

Id: [0x0023ABF8]
And you're Kyra's hope for the rebellion? Gods help us all! If the child belonged to Podarkes, and the child is Kyra, then that would make...

Id: [0x0023ABFB]
Unbelievable. Podarkes is Kyra's <i>pater, misthios!</i> Her <i>pater!</i>

Id: [0x0023ABFC]
[&ah]Of course!

Id: [0x0023ABFE]
[&scoff]Not very wise, are you, misthios?

Id: [0x0023AC06]
As for Pausanias, it would be wise to deal with him as soon as possible.

Id: [0x0023AC07]
I will. I'M  a modified line

Id: [0x0023AC0C]
With pleasure.

Id: [0x0023AC0E]
When you've dealt with him, meet me at Leonidas's tomb. I must show you something important.

Id: [0x0023AC0F]
I'll find you there, <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x0023AC12]
You know what you have to do. Pausanias must die.

Id: [0x0023AC15]
Our elder priest went to the cave to make peace with the raiders hiding in the shadows, and he hasn't come back.

Id: [0x0023AC17]
I'M a new line

Id: [0x0023AC3A]
I'm all yours.

Id: [0x0023AC47]
We still have that wine I gave you. Bring it.

Id: [0x0023AC59]
You're the Eagle Bearer, the one who defeated Chrysis! We're holding a ceremony to celebrate her death.

Id: [0x0023AC61]
Why thank the gods when I'm the one who killed her? You should throw a ceremony for <i>me</i>.

Id: [0x0023AC66]
Chrysis's death was well deserved. The gods should be thanked for her demise.

Id: [0x0023AC6A]
We're not just thanking the gods. We priestesses will also pray to never be led astray like Chrysis was.

Id: [0x0023AC6B]
That's a good thing to pray for.

Id: [0x0023AC6C]
There's so many preparations to make. I'm inviting a musician to perform, a farmer to bring an animal to sacrifice, and a merchant to bring wine... But I don't have time to deliver all the invitations.

Id: [0x0023AC83]
I know where this is going... Kyra, I came here to do a job, and that's it.

Id: [0x0023AC84]
Oh. No, of course. I'm a rebel leader. You're a mercenary. I... get it. I do. [beat]I should gather the spoils of the hunt and get back to my people.

Id: [0x0023AC86]
Take some with you. It's as much yours as it is mine.

Id: [0x0023AC8E]
Bring the pelts to me. I'll await your return with my sisters, the Daughters of Artemis.

Id: [0x0023AC90]
The Child of the Eagle! You are the one they say killed Chrysis, the priestess from Argolis.

Id: [0x0023AC98]
That witch stole babies from their own mothers and raised them to be monsters. She lost her mind.

Id: [0x0023AC99]
I heard rumors that Chrysis was not of her own mind, but she was a great inspiration. I wish I had her support now.

Id: [0x0023AC9B]
I think I may already have some of them...

Id: [0x0023AC9C]
I couldn't let Chrysis hurt anyone else. I did what I had to.

Id: [0x0023AC9D]
So it's true that she hurt people? I thought she used her strength and influence for good.

Id: [0x0023AC9F]
Chrysis no longer understood the will of the gods, and acted against them.

Id: [0x0023ACA0]
What do you understand of the will of the gods? Get out of my sight... <i>maláka</i>!

Id: [0x0023ACA2]
You deserve better role models than her.

Id: [0x0023ACA3]
Maybe I'll find them when I join the temple. But they want me to sacrifice a lion, bear, or wolf, and I don't think I'm strong enough.

Id: [0x0023ACA7]
[&breath]Just focus on what you came here to do.

Id: [0x0023ACB5]
I will find the doll that proves Kyra is Podarkes's daughter.

Id: [0x0023ACBA]
They're that good, are they?

Id: [0x0023ACBB]
War's brewing. The Athenians need good bows if they want to hold off the Spartans.

Id: [0x0023ACBC]
Everybody benefits, I guess.

Id: [0x0023ACBD]
Who are you, Markos? You should be tired of this small-time shit.

Id: [0x0023ACBE]
[beat]<i>You'd</i> make a fortune in this war. Plus, I hear you're a secret Spartan.

Id: [0x0023ACBF]
That was a long time ago. I'm a Kephallonian.

Id: [0x0023ACC1]
These bows'll make me rich as Kroisos.

Id: [0x0023ACC5]
Neokles! You can't hide forever!

Id: [0x0023ACC7]
We're going to find you, traitor!

Id: [0x0023ACC8]
Think we won't spill your blood on Delos? Ha!

Id: [0x0023ACC9]
[beat]I must go, I have an appointment with a patient elsewhere.

Id: [0x0023ACD0]
I've already said too much. Leave me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023ACD5]
What's with Kyra?

Id: [0x0023ACD8]
Leave me.

Id: [0x0023ACDA]
Kyra is Podarkes's daughter...

Id: [0x0023ACE2]
A little trick I learned from a man named Hippokrates. Well, he taught me where to cut.

Id: [0x0023ACE6]
A little trick my <i>mater</i> taught me.

Id: [0x0023ACEA]
So I finally get to the beach, and find this giant bear had eaten the crew of smugglers.

Id: [0x0023ACEB]
A bear? By Callisto, what did you do?

Id: [0x0023ACEC]
Well... I killed it. What else could I do? It would've torn me to shreds.

Id: [0x0023ACED]
Ha! I'm starting to think no one is safe from that spear of yours. And what of the woman?

Id: [0x0023ACF1]
I spared her. She's probably halfway to Lakonia by now.

Id: [0x0023ACF3]
She attacked me... on Delos! The sacred soil's never seen so much action.

Id: [0x0023ACF7]
Relax. I'm joking.

Id: [0x0023ACF8]
Ha! Yeah. Good one.

Id: [0x0023ACFA]
So, Sokrates turns around, and everyone who was trapped in the conversation had wandered off.

Id: [0x0023ACFB]
Ha! You mean escaped.

Id: [0x0023ACFC]
Exactly. [&breath]He's not so bad. You just need to know how to handle him.

Id: [0x0023ACFD]
Is that what this is? You know how to handle me?

Id: [0x0023AD01]
Kyra hunt with you? Never hunt with me.

Id: [0x0023AD05]
I'll tell Thaletas what happened between us, but not until he's ready.

Id: [0x0023AD13]
Did you expect any less?

Id: [0x0023AD2B]
Find his eye!

Id: [0x0023AD2C]
Burn it all! Every last fuckin' thing!

Id: [0x0023AD32]
The people have turned from Athena. Their loyalties have been stolen by false prophets.

Id: [0x0023AD38]
People can worship who and how they want. They might have good reason to change.

Id: [0x0023AD39]
They could, but in this case they're very wrong. They aren't following priests, but bandits.

Id: [0x0023AD3B]
Athena will sort it out with her sword and shield.

Id: [0x0023AD3C]
I hope she will grant these worshippers wisdom instead. They're not being led by priests, but by bandits.

Id: [0x0023AD3E]
Bandits? Ones pretending to be priests, you mean?

Id: [0x0023AD3F]
Exactly. They accost innocent people and demand their possessions as offerings. They're causing harm and giving real priests a bad name.

Id: [0x0023AD59]
I don't need a reason, good or otherwise.

Id: [0x0023AD62]
I need those seals to shove in the faces of the assembled generals, to get them to wake up. While they've been debating and stalling, I've been winning the war.

Id: [0x0023AD6F]
I do.

Id: [0x0023AD70]
More seals, and more proof what we're doing is working. Thankfully, there are at least some people in power willing to listen to me.

Id: [0x0023AD75]
I'm still looking.

Id: [0x0023AD7A]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0023AD7B]
Return when you do.

Id: [0x0023AD7F]
Athenian polemarchs are paralyzed with indecision. They serve too many masters.

Id: [0x0023AD80]
I need you to buy me time. Eliminate the enemy's fort commanders and bring me their seals.

Id: [0x0023AD86]
Where are you taking me?

Id: [0x0023AD87]
To one of my favorite spots on all the Delos Islands.

Id: [0x0023AD88]
Isn't a Spartan's favorite spot the battlefield?

Id: [0x0023AD89]
[&laughs]Fair enough. I'm taking you to my second favorite spot.

Id: [0x0023AD8A]
[&breath]When I got here, I had just lost so many people. Every man I ever looked up to sank on that ship.

Id: [0x0023AD8B]
You needed a place to get away from all this death. I understand.

Id: [0x0023AD8C]
I knew you would. That's why I'm showing it to you. This place isn't just where I go to clear my thoughts. It...

Id: [0x0023AD8D]
It what?

Id: [0x0023AD8E]
It reminds me of home.

Id: [0x0023AD91]
I'm not a problem. I'm a Spartan you keep at home supervising farmers while I could be out in the world finding adventure. You give my brothers the chance to explore, why not me?

Id: [0x0023AD92]
An explorer, are you?

Id: [0x0023AD96]
Eagle Bearer, you bless this temple with your presence. If I may ask, I'm having a little problem.

Id: [0x0023AD9F]
So you're the Eagle Bearer everyone's been talking about. I hope you live up to your reputation. I'm Zopheras.

Id: [0x0023ADA0]
Could you please educate my daughter to behave as a Spartan woman should?

Id: [0x0023ADBF]
If both you and Zopheras agree, I'll train your daughter to be a fine Spartan. Beginning with her physical strength, of course. It's the only way she can keep your household safe and prosperous.

Id: [0x0023ADC0]
I won't argue with that.

Id: [0x0023ADC2]
The gods must envy your humility.

Id: [0x0023ADDB]
There is a cave nearby that contains a secret shrine to Zeus with ancient texts.

Id: [0x0023ADDC]
What are the texts for?

Id: [0x0023ADDD]
I don't know yet, but I was shown them in a dream. The gods want me to retrieve them. Or destroy them... I woke up before the end.

Id: [0x0023ADDE]
Why don't you do it?

Id: [0x0023ADDF]
Bears are said to roam that area. And I'm a priestess, not a hunter.

Id: [0x0023ADEF]
Strength is powerless in the face of beauty. Even Heracles fell to its sway.

Id: [0x0023ADF1]
You slay me as easily with your words as your weapons do these beasts.

Id: [0x0023ADF2]
You're not one of my soldiers. You better have a good reason for being here.

Id: [0x0023ADF6]
I told you to return with the proof. Don't waste my time!

Id: [0x0023ADF8]
I suppose if the Eagle Bearer says it... All right. Train my daughter as you see fit.

Id: [0x0023ADFA]
Let's begin your training with running. Try to keep up.

Id: [0x0023AE0D]
There's a group of heretic soldiers denying our gods and calling on foreign ones. If they keep it up, this land will be cursed.

Id: [0x0023AE0E]
How do you plan to stop them?

Id: [0x0023AE0F]
The false idols and their worshippers must be eliminated. Show them there's no place for impiety here.

Id: [0x0023AE14]
I hope you're teaching Zopheras how to be a fine Spartan woman.

Id: [0x0023AE16]
I really don't have time to teach Zopheras right now.

Id: [0x0023AE1F]
Please help my daughter. I don't know what to do about her terrible attitude.

Id: [0x0023AE29]
I should've known it was you who'd ask for the furs, Ilos.

Id: [0x0023AE2A]
And I should've known it was <i>you</i> to get them for me. Kassandra's always on the job.

Id: [0x0023AE2B]
Don't tell Markos, he'll get jealous.

Id: [0x0023AE2C]
I post it publically to give the others a chance, but you're always so keen.

Id: [0x0023AE2D]
What are the pelts for this time?

Id: [0x0023AE2E]
The Athenians want armor for the war. Good protection for them, good drachmae for me.

Id: [0x0023AE33]
Here they are, all accounted for.

Id: [0x0023AE35]
Stay out of trouble, Ilos.

Id: [0x0023AE36]
You should take your own advice!

Id: [0x0023AE38]
Then I've got some hunting to do.

Id: [0x0023AE3B]
In record time, too. Take your pay, it's well earned.

Id: [0x0023AF59]
This place is full of wolves. Should take you no time.

Id: [0x0023AF5E]
Use me as an endorsement for your mercenary work anytime.

Id: [0x0023AF67]
Almost tore my leg clean off!

Id: [0x0023AF68]
It barely nipped you. Just a bit of skin.

Id: [0x0023AF69]
Uh... Doesn't look good from where I'm standing.

Id: [0x0023AF6A]
Shh! Don't tell him that.

Id: [0x0023AF6B]
I'm gonna die!

Id: [0x0023AF6C]
It's OK, you'll save money on sandals.

Id: [0x0023AFEE]
Since the army fell, my sisters have been rounded up and accused of impiety. It's chaos. No justice. Just death. The soldiers will be here soon for my head.

Id: [0x0023AFF8]
A priest hired those bandits to kill me. He claimed I'm a witch and charged me with impiety. Now he's hired a mercenary to take my head.

Id: [0x0023AFFC]
Ah. Some bite to you, is there?

Id: [0x0023AFFD]
This solution keeps my family safe, and their position secure.

Id: [0x0023B007]
I don't want to slowly waste away. I want to die in peace while my family remembers me in a good light.

Id: [0x0023B00B]
Do you ever get worried that we'll be trapped in here by an earthquake?

Id: [0x0023B00C]
Piss off Poseidon recently?

Id: [0x0023B00D]
There's another way out, right?

Id: [0x0023B012]
Do you want my help or not? Tell me what you want.

Id: [0x0023B03E]
You wouldn't be talking about this helmet, would you?

Id: [0x0023B042]
You found it! This saved me more times than I can count.

Id: [0x0023B044]
Thaletas? What are you and your men doing out in the open?

Id: [0x0023B045]
[&laughs]The Athenian cowards are too afraid to attack anyone on their sacred lands. We like coming here to taunt them.

Id: [0x0023B046]
Spartans... You're all the same.

Id: [0x0023B04D]
I was worried about employing a mercenary, but you've been a pleasant surprise.

Id: [0x0023B04E]
Yes. That's what they all call me. A pleasant surprise.

Id: [0x0023B04F]
I suspect if they call you anything offensive, they don't live long.

Id: [0x0023B052]
I'm assuming you'd be interested in more work?

Id: [0x0023B059]
Are you ready to work with me yet?

Id: [0x0023B05F]
Not now. Maybe later.

Id: [0x0023B061]
I'll get you your seals.

Id: [0x0023B068]
I know enough.

Id: [0x0023B06A]
Who does a general like you look up to?

Id: [0x0023B06F]
Do you have my seals yet?

Id: [0x0023B073]
What was it you needed?

Id: [0x0023B07D]
Why yes, I do.

Id: [0x0023B07E]
Good. The Spartans will soon realize someone is picking off their senior commanders.

Id: [0x0023B080]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0023B081]
Return when you do.

Id: [0x0023B083]
If there's more work to be had.

Id: [0x0023B084]
There's always work available. And always people like you, happy to take advantage of that.

Id: [0x0023B088]
We don't have to be enemies. Surely we can respect each other.

Id: [0x0023B089]
We can try.

Id: [0x0023B08A]
You wanted me to do more work for you?

Id: [0x0023B08B]
Yes. I need you to remove more Spartan commanders. Remember, you must bring me their seals.

Id: [0x0023B092]
I don't care how you feel about me. Just tell me what the job is.

Id: [0x0023B093]
I need you to kill Spartan commanders and bring me their seals. And as you take drachmae in exchange for killing people, it seems appropriate. Are you interested or not?

Id: [0x0023B285]
I can't believe they stole it. Of all the things they could take!

Id: [0x0023B291]
Hold on... you seem familiar.

Id: [0x0023B296]
You're wealthy. You could buy yourself a new vase.

Id: [0x0023B297]
A new vase? Didn't you hear me? It's a family heirloom, you can't replace something like that.

Id: [0x0023B299]
I carry with me something passed down from my mother. I appreciate the value of family heirlooms.

Id: [0x0023B29A]
It's strange how inanimate objects can generate real feeling in us, isn't it?

Id: [0x0023B29C]
How much is this vase worth to you?

Id: [0x0023B29E]
Have you not heard of me? I am Euthymos, master Olympic trainer.

Id: [0x0023B29F]
I'd pay a substantial amount of drachmae for it. A very substantial amount.

Id: [0x0023B2A0]
Is finding my vase something you could do?

Id: [0x0023B2A2]
Such pretty words! They almost scare me!

Id: [0x0023B2A6]
I've heard other things, though. In particular, that students of yours have gone missing.

Id: [0x0023B2AA]
Missing? Nonsense! My students are champions. They fly towards adventure all the time. Under my wing, they will soar to great heights like a hot-blooded Pegasos!

Id: [0x0023B2AB]
Do you remember a former student named Solon?

Id: [0x0023B2AD]
You think you can storm into <i>my</i> school[2400848] and demand answers like an impertinent slave? You'll sooner be gutted like one!

Id: [0x0023B2B0]
The northern hills of Mount Ochi... Is there a more precise place I should look for these bandits?

Id: [0x0023B2BA]
Skandeia Bay. The ship should be east of here.

Id: [0x0023B2BF]
The Ancient Pearl.

Id: [0x0023B2C4]
This is the Vineyard Canyon region.

Id: [0x0023B2C9]
There it is. The Affluence Bay region.

Id: [0x0023B2CE]
The Petrified Valley.

Id: [0x0023B2D3]
Skandeia Bay. The hunter should be in this region.

Id: [0x0023B2D8]
The Pilgrim Hill region.

Id: [0x0023B2DD]
The Skandeia Bay region.

Id: [0x0023B2E2]
Skandeia Bay. I've found it.

Id: [0x0023B2E8]
Minotaur Hills region.

Id: [0x0023B2ED]
The Minotaur Hills region. The trail should be here.

Id: [0x0023B2F7]
That's the armor I'm looking for.

Id: [0x0023B300]
Connection? Nonsense! This is a place of blood, sweat, and brawn!

Id: [0x0023B30E]
There it is. The flower.

Id: [0x0023B313]
The region of Octopus Bay.

Id: [0x0023B318]
Zeus’s Playground. It's so majestic.

Id: [0x0023B31D]
The Little Egypt region.

Id: [0x0023B322]
The region of Aphrodite’s Watch.

Id: [0x0023B327]
This is Aphrodite’s Watch.

Id: [0x0023B336]
Taunts won't work, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0023B35E]
Horses? Why should I bother with those filthy beasts? We have helots for that.

Id: [0x0023B383]
What?! When did this happen?

Id: [0x0023B384]
Earlier today. I was taking my boy fishing when we heard the screams.

Id: [0x0023B385]
What were they doing out there?

Id: [0x0023B386]
Hunting party, I think.

Id: [0x0023B387]
We must send aid at once.

Id: [0x0023B38B]
Please, by all the gods, save me.

Id: [0x0023B38F]
I swear by Zeus - if you help me I'll make you rich.

Id: [0x0023B393]
Quickly! Kill that beast before it finishes me off.

Id: [0x0023B397]
Thank you. Thank you. I owe you my life, brave hero.

Id: [0x0023B39B]
I can't walk. My injuries are too severe. Please, take me to a healer.

Id: [0x0023B39F]
I feel faint. I'm getting dizzy.

Id: [0x0023B3A5]
He's been mauled quite badly.

Id: [0x0023B3A6]
He's lost a lot of blood.

Id: [0x0023B3A7]
I think these wounds should be sealable.

Id: [0x0023B3A8]
Wait... I know this man.

Id: [0x0023B3A9]
This is that monster, Galeos.

Id: [0x0023B3AC]
Now, we'll race horses. But not like they do in athletic games. We'll make our own course.

Id: [0x0023B3B6]
I'm so thirsty.

Id: [0x0023B3BA]
The gods have forsaken me.

Id: [0x0023B3BE]
Please, set us free.

Id: [0x0023B3C2]
I can't escape... I'm injured. [beat]They left me in here to die.

Id: [0x0023B3C6]
Please, I won't make it far. You have to help me get out of here.

Id: [0x0023B3CA]
Thank you for freeing us. That beast Galeos has worked all of us to the brink of death. Now I can return home to my family.

Id: [0x0023B3CE]
Praise the gods. I'm free!

Id: [0x0023B3DF]
How does a helot become a general?

Id: [0x0023B3E0]
By their wits! Spartans humiliate and torture the helots, yet expect them to follow their commands.

Id: [0x0023B3E5]
Help! Somebody? [beat]Anybody? <i>Hello?</i>

Id: [0x0023B3EB]
Markos?

Id: [0x0023B3EC]
Kassandra? <i>Chaire</i>!

Id: [0x0023B3ED]
How...

Id: [0x0023B3EE]
Kept myself busy, haven't I? No time to explain here. Get me out!

Id: [0x0023B406]
Horses are your most loyal partners in battle. Treat them well, and they'll never disappoint you.

Id: [0x0023B407]
That's really sweet.

Id: [0x0023B40C]
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

Id: [0x0023B411]
What the fuck? My silos! Stop!

Id: [0x0023B417]
Come out, come out, Markos!

Id: [0x0023B41B]
All right, Markos, this is it. The grand finale!

Id: [0x0023B420]
Horses are beasts of muscle and power. You'll never understand until you hold one between your thighs.

Id: [0x0023B421]
Well, when you put it that way... ride on.

Id: [0x0023B42D]
Is this what you wanted?

Id: [0x0023B42E]
By the gods! Truly, Artemis has brought us together. I'm eager to see how else you can surprise me.

Id: [0x0023B43B]
Let's race to the bridge south of Sparta. Ready, go!

Id: [0x0023B44B]
Congratulations.

Id: [0x0023B457]
Your strategy has served you well so far. What will it take to win?

Id: [0x0023B458]
I'm not idle while you kill commanders. I've had enemy forts surveyed and know all of their supply runs.

Id: [0x0023B45B]
Others boast of royal blood. I'm a descendant of Herakles. That gives me more legitimate claim to lead than even Archidamos.

Id: [0x0023B461]
I need you to infiltrate the enemy forts. Athenian command must be removed. Can you do it?

Id: [0x0023B499]
Speaking of beasts, we should talk about the others.

Id: [0x0023B4D4]
You're in a good mood. Must have been some party.

Id: [0x0023B4D6]
If I fall for something, it won't be a beast, but someone here on Chios.

Id: [0x0023B4D7]
Don't talk of falling here. Rather think of ascending... to new heights.

Id: [0x0023B4D9]
You could spin the wheel any direction and you'll find a Cultist. The scum's everywhere.

Id: [0x0023B4DA]
Then we have nothing to lose.

Id: [0x0023B4DB]
Nothing but time! Let's track them down.

Id: [0x0023B4F1]
I've made my choice.

Id: [0x0023B4F4]
My youngest is a dreamer. His head is filled with boyhood stories. He must learn how to serve his nation first, and then his family.

Id: [0x0023B4F5]
It's not an easy path.

Id: [0x0023B4F6]
He will find glory as a true Spartan soldier, or die bravely in the attempt. There is no greater way to honor Sparta.

Id: [0x0023B504]
Years of training made me a warrior. Life as a <i>misthios</i> has honed those abilities.

Id: [0x0023B506]
Then at the least you should applaud yourself for your dedication to your... <i>art</i>.

Id: [0x0023B509]
You're letting me go?[beat] Then at least take this sword. Nothing special, but it's better than that rusty one you've got.

Id: [0x0023B50B]
With the Cyclops involved, I'll need it.

Id: [0x0023B514]
No more than the bull. The gods have blessed us with a world of wonder, and we should honor it.

Id: [0x0023B515]
Spoken like a true Daughter of Artemis.

Id: [0x0023B51B]
Thaletas. Listen to me. Kyra is dead.

Id: [0x0023B51C]
What? No! You... you killed her?[&scream][[screams in rage]][/&scream]

Id: [0x0023B522]
The gods may watch me, but they do not guide me.

Id: [0x0023B523]
Then I feel for you. Artemis has always steered me right, and that includes in meeting you.

Id: [0x0023B52E]
Chance can easily be blamed on the gods.

Id: [0x0023B52F]
But can destiny?

Id: [0x0023B534]
I follow where the gods lead, and they led me to you.

Id: [0x0023B535]
[&ahem]They have a sense of humor.

Id: [0x0023B539]
Hello. I am Kassandra.

Id: [0x0023B53B]
Oh Hera and Aphrodite, please grant my daughter the virtue of obedience.

Id: [0x0023B53E]
How so?

Id: [0x0023B53F]
We will talk of the gods and their wishes once the hunt is done.

Id: [0x0023B540]
But Spartans never run! Only cowards do. Why should I train in running?

Id: [0x0023B545]
Strong legs mean you'll thrust your spear with more force.

Id: [0x0023B546]
And yours do seem very strong.

Id: [0x0023B548]
Spartans run <i>into</i> battle. The faster you run, the more glory you can earn.

Id: [0x0023B549]
That does make sense.

Id: [0x0023B54C]
Let's race through the theater to the entrance of the Dromos. Last one there's a wounded goat.

Id: [0x0023B553]
Phoibe, just... be careful. You're alone now, since -

Id: [0x0023B554]
Since my parents died? I'm OK, I've got you! And you've got me and Markos. [beat]We're your family, right?

Id: [0x0023B556]
Right.

Id: [0x0023B55E]
No, not in something like this, that feeds off the dead!

Id: [0x0023B55F]
It is part of the cycle of life. All things die, and it's not as if we don't feast on dead flesh.

Id: [0x0023B561]
Glad you could make it.

Id: [0x0023B562]
I'll get you next time!

Id: [0x0023B565]
I... let you win.

Id: [0x0023B566]
I hate when people do that.

Id: [0x0023B56B]
You're right. It's just an animal, doing what's in its nature.

Id: [0x0023B56D]
Aren't we all?

Id: [0x0023B56F]
But not today.

Id: [0x0023B572]
You think too much.

Id: [0x0023B573]
I came to these islands expecting death, but I never expected to feel this pain.

Id: [0x0023B576]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x0023B578]
But not today.

Id: [0x0023B57A]
I should be with my men. I'll see you at the celebration.

Id: [0x0023B584]
And that's how you master a beast.

Id: [0x0023B585]
That was more speed than mastery.

Id: [0x0023B58A]
The horse wasn't feeling so good today.

Id: [0x0023B58B]
Don't blame the beast for your shortcomings.

Id: [0x0023B58E]
How are my lessons so far, Zopheras?

Id: [0x0023B58F]
Not bad... But why did you decide to teach me anyway? Don't you have more exciting things to do? Treasures to find, tyrants to depose?

Id: [0x0023B594]
If no one taught, people would live alone in their ignorance. By sharing knowledge we grow closer together.

Id: [0x0023B595]
I might like to get closer.

Id: [0x0023B598]
The secret is, by teaching a skill to someone else, you're also improving your own technique. That's the only way you'll both reach peak performance.

Id: [0x0023B599]
You'll have to show me your technique.

Id: [0x0023B59F]
Search the caves. That's where they'll be hiding. Beware though[&cough], they're beyond reason.

Id: [0x0023B5B0]
Absolutely.

Id: [0x0023B5B1]
Beautiful, isn't it?

Id: [0x0023B5C1]
Strange. I don't hear anything. Do you?

Id: [0x0023B5C8]
If you're right, you'll gain their respect after this.

Id: [0x0023B5CD]
Leave me.

Id: [0x0023B5D3]
I mean... I - [&gasp]I'm better with a spear than with words.

Id: [0x0023B5D5]
Be calm. A true hunter always aims for the heart.

Id: [0x0023B5D6]
Daphnae... I...

Id: [0x0023B5D7]
Shh... Anyway, we are past words.

Id: [0x0023B5D9]
Kindness has never brought me anything but misfortune. It's a burden I wish I could be rid of.

Id: [0x0023B5DB]
I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0023B5DF]
You stubborn, bull-headed, glorious fool.

Id: [0x0023B5E0]
I sent out two notes, and who responds? Kassandra, the mighty Eagle Bearer, and Thaletas, a Spartan.

Id: [0x0023B5E2]
The gods speak only to me!

Id: [0x0023B5E7]
What's this?

Id: [0x0023B5EA]
The worshippers puzzle me. They murmur something... Di... sioi... I can't make it out.

Id: [0x0023B5EF]
Don't be. I don't need anyone's sympathy.

Id: [0x0023B5F0]
Then you will not have it.

Id: [0x0023B5F1]
Yes.

Id: [0x0023B5F2]
Nothing else?

Id: [0x0023B5F7]
He's gone now, but we're together, like Artemis and Apollo, like Mykonos and Delos. And the people are celebrating us.

Id: [0x0023B602]
Does it have to do with - whatever that name was you said?

Id: [0x0023B60E]
When?

Id: [0x0023B610]
When you are ready.

Id: [0x0023B613]
Not much of a burial site. Mules are buried in higher places of honor.

Id: [0x0023B615]
It's hard to predict how you'll answer my questions. You're a complicated person, aren't you?

Id: [0x0023B617]
You answered my questions so thoughtfully. You care deeply about others. You put their needs before yours, don't you?

Id: [0x0023B619]
You answer my questions with such passion and authority. You like being in charge, don't you?

Id: [0x0023B61F]
The markings match Eppie's stone!

Id: [0x0023B626]
Ahh, this is more like it. Let's see what we have.

Id: [0x0023B634]
I have what you need.

Id: [0x0023B635]
Give it here then.

Id: [0x0023B63D]
Leader!

Id: [0x0023B63E]
Yes. Kill me and the Daughters of Artemis will be your allies. [beat]The gods have brought us together for this moment. Whatever your choice, there is no turning back.

Id: [0x0023B63F]
Think you've got it in you to help?

Id: [0x0023B642]
Daphnae!

Id: [0x0023B643]
My heart may belong to you, but my duty is to Artemis.

Id: [0x0023B646]
But, I thought...

Id: [0x0023B647]
Another life, perhaps, but my body belongs to Artemis. Leave, and do not think of me again.

Id: [0x0023B64C]
But Daphnae!

Id: [0x0023B651]
All right. What about the politician?

Id: [0x0023B652]
He was brilliant and opposed me - a fatal combination. [beat]So, he needed replacing, and I had a much dumber man perfect for the job.

Id: [0x0023B653]
The woman with the <i>olisbos</i>?

Id: [0x0023B654]
We talked about this... It wasn't about the woman, but her husband. He governs the trade routes between Attika and Megaris - or, I should say, <i>I </i>do now.

Id: [0x0023B666]
By Poseidon, she knows!

Id: [0x0023B667]
Shut your teeth! She doesn't know anything! How could she?

Id: [0x0023B670]
I thought we might continue our training with something more... personal. But you seem exhausted from keeping up with me for so long. Thanks for the exercise, though.

Id: [0x0023B671]
I'll have to train more myself.

Id: [0x0023B673]
I told you Laios! The gods come to punish us!

Id: [0x0023B686]
So, that package in Korinthia.

Id: [0x0023B687]
What about your friend - the one pretending to be a man?

Id: [0x0023B688]
That was out of the goodness of my heart, and gods curse anyone who doubts that.

Id: [0x0023B689]
I've heard enough.

Id: [0x0023B68A]
Aren't you going to ask me about Iris?

Id: [0x0023B68B]
Let me guess - rich house, respected family - with her wealth you can rule all of Athens.

Id: [0x0023B68C]
Of course not! I marry for love. If those other things happen... Well, I wouldn't complain.

Id: [0x0023B68F]
I never would have guessed.

Id: [0x0023B690]
It's time everyone sees a more serious Alkibiades - the Alkibiades I've only shown glimpses of in the past.

Id: [0x0023B691]
I'm glad I could help. I'll make sure you don't forget me when you lead Athens.

Id: [0x0023B692]
I'd never forget you.

Id: [0x0023B694]
You're far too useful.

Id: [0x0023B697]
Podarkes was only one Cultist, Barnabas. Wherever we sail, we will find more of them... and I will kill them all.

Id: [0x0023B6A1]
I'm tracking deserters who downed shield and ran, leaving their brothers behind.

Id: [0x0023B6A7]
Their shield protected the person next to them as well as themselves.

Id: [0x0023B6A9]
The life of a Spartan soldier is not for everyone. Maybe you're better off without them.

Id: [0x0023B6AB]
In Sparta, you come back with your shield or on it. Each shield thrown down shames us. Even worse, one of those worms took one with him as he ran.

Id: [0x0023B6B9]
I thought we could continue with some more <i>intensive</i> training, Kassandra. If you've got some energy left.

Id: [0x0023B6BF]
I'm your teacher, you're my student. And besides, your mother would not be pleased. But I'm glad I impressed you with my teaching.

Id: [0x0023B6C2]
Well then, let's begin our advanced lessons.

Id: [0x0023B6CB]
Thanks for taking such good care of my daughter, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0023B6CC]
Thanks, Kassandra. You've inspired me to train harder.

Id: [0x0023B6CD]
You can call me Kassandra.

Id: [0x0023B6CE]
Maybe. Remind me what you wanted.

Id: [0x0023B6D0]
I want you to remove Spartan commanders.

Id: [0x0023B6D9]
And bring you their seals as proof.

Id: [0x0023B6DC]
[&laughs]Make the tale great. The troops deserve it. [begrudgingly]Even Thaletas.

Id: [0x0023B6E1]
On your order. But first, let the crew enjoy a drink and a song. You deserve one, too.

Id: [0x0023B6E5]
I didn't "take" anything!

Id: [0x0023B6E6]
Even after you tried to turn the rebels against her, Kyra still chose you over me!

Id: [0x0023B6EB]
There is a unit of elite Athenians in this area. They call themselves lions... Keep a caged lion in their camp and feed it their victims.

Id: [0x0023B6EC]
Even enemies deserve better than that.

Id: [0x0023B6ED]
Those beasts should see what a real lion can do, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023B6FC]
We've been here long enough. No speech tonight.

Id: [0x0023B6FD]
[&ah]Kassandra! Heroes like you are meant to give speeches - it's what makes you heroes! [beat]But, I'll round up the crew. The Adrestia will be ready to sail when you are.

Id: [0x0023B704]
A fine speech... Though I'm not sure many of these rebels can imagine a free Delos.

Id: [0x0023B705]
A fine speech... If a little violent.

Id: [0x0023B711]
I won't rest until I know my family is safe. We do what we've always done - follow their trail until I've brought everyone together again.

Id: [0x0023B712]
[&breath]The world is ours, and the wind is at our backs. We sail for adventure, Barnabas. Just as we always do.

Id: [0x0023B716]
But I'll need something from you before I can talk about it.

Id: [0x0023B748]
I'm curious why you're not excited to have your freedom?

Id: [0x0023B749]
With my master I have purpose, responsibilities, food, and shelter. All the things I wouldn't have on my own.

Id: [0x0023B74A]
I will go find these bandits and get your master's vase.

Id: [0x0023B74E]
I was able to get the vase back from the bandits.

Id: [0x0023B74F]
That's good to hear. Please consider what we discussed when you speak with my master.

Id: [0x0023B75B]
The Hunted Forest of Artemis region.

Id: [0x0023B77B]
I pay people to do things for me. Come back if you want to earn some drachmae.

Id: [0x0023B77F]
I just have to make them <i>think</i> I've killed the Minotaur. Our village would become a shrine to me, the new Theseus. Morys the Magnificent, Slayer of the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0023B780]
We would prosper again.

Id: [0x0023B781]
Sounds like a dream.

Id: [0x0023B782]
A dream where people care about my village? Trade with it? That's a dream worth having.

Id: [0x0023B783]
I'll need to look convincing - like a regal, conquering, Minotaur-killing hero! <LF>

Id: [0x0023B78A]
The Huntress Village. Hope they've heard I'm their new leader... Don't want to have to kill my new people.

Id: [0x0023B78F]
I - no, I'm a, I'm a -

Id: [0x0023B790]
Go home, "hero."

Id: [0x0023B793]
Do not put words in my mouth.

Id: [0x0023B794]
Why not, they're good words! My people are kind, and loving, and somewhat dim -

Id: [0x0023B797]
Really? Hard to believe.

Id: [0x0023B799]
Hmm. I think I might just have what you need...

Id: [0x0023B79C]
You're mistaken, I am not the champion.

Id: [0x0023B7AC]
No. The axe and armor are <i>mine. </i>You think they could make you look like <i>a Minotaur slayer? </i>No matter what armor you wear, you'll always be Morys the Pathetic. You fool no one.

Id: [0x0023B7AD]
Of course, the axe and armor are yours.

Id: [0x0023B7B2]
You know, your slave is very loyal. You've already granted him his freedom, but I think you should keep him on. He may even want that.

Id: [0x0023B7B4]
Is it true? You want to stay?

Id: [0x0023B7B5]
Yes, I do.

Id: [0x0023B7B6]
Then why didn't you say something?

Id: [0x0023B7C2]
There it is. The copper mine.

Id: [0x0023B7E2]
Master, I have a concern.

Id: [0x0023B7E3]
Yet another example of why I'll miss you when you're gone.

Id: [0x0023B7ED]
Farewell, brave warrior.

Id: [0x0023B7F2]
All these people died just for the Cult to find me...

Id: [0x0023BAA2]
You haven't seen anything yet.

Id: [0x0023BAAA]
The warehouse is off limits.

Id: [0x0023BAAB]
But I <i>need</i> those records!

Id: [0x0023BAAC]
And I need three fewer daughters, but we don't often get what we want, old friend.

Id: [0x0023BAB3]
A <i>misthios</i>...! Destroy the records before they claim them!

Id: [0x0023BAB8]
Destroy the evidence!

Id: [0x0023BABF]
Please, find my father! Find Leiandros!

Id: [0x0023BAC5]
These Masked Men, they're organized and unafraid. Their greatest weapon is no blade; <i>it's our greed.</i>

Id: [0x0023BAC6]
Every merchant, every man and his slave earn enough drachmae out of this charade to make Midas blush. The myth of the Minotaur makes us all rich... and we turn a blind eye to the cost.

Id: [0x0023BACC]
Gah, why is this suit chafing?! I used a whole bottle of olive oil...!

Id: [0x0023BAD2]
Hard... to breathe... in a costume... this magnificent...

Id: [0x0023BAD8]
By Zeus, this fur doesn't breathe <i>at all!</i>

Id: [0x0023BADE]
<i>You </i>are the Minotaur. You <i>are </i>the Minotaur. You are the <i>Minotaur! </i>[beat]You are <i>the </i>Minotaur. [beat]No, no, the last one was better.

Id: [0x0023BAE4]
I'm coming, Amara! Do not be afraid!

Id: [0x0023BAE5]
[beat]And don't you be afraid, Leiandros. She needs you.

Id: [0x0023BAEB]
<i>Misthios</i>, over here! It's me, Leiandros, the friendly Minotaur in the bushes!

Id: [0x0023BAF0]
Don't be afraid, it's not the real Minotaur - it's only me, Leiandros!

Id: [0x0023BAFF]
Prepare to be Mina-<i>torn apart</i>!

Id: [0x0023BB06]
Take cover! I'll find you when I know it's safe.

Id: [0x0023BB0B]
Mooooooo!!!

Id: [0x0023BB10]
The Minotaur calls you! Come and face me! Show me your bravery...

Id: [0x0023BB11]
[beat]By leaving the safety of your impenetrable fortress and coming out into the open!

Id: [0x0023BB16]
Where is your honor, you masked malákes?!

Id: [0x0023BB17]
Come, bring your flesh to my blades!

Id: [0x0023BB1C]
Look at me! Over here, everyone! It's the Minotaur! And he's - he's so angry, right now, at you?

Id: [0x0023BB1D]
So... that's it! Look in this direction! Direct your focus onto me, and only me! Because I'm the Minotaur, like I said! So, I'm priority one! Grr! Stomp, stomp!

Id: [0x0023BB22]
Face me!

Id: [0x0023BB28]
Their masks... Their masks...

Id: [0x0023BB2D]
I didn't do anything. Let me go! Please... please...!

Id: [0x0023BB32]
No, please - I've been quiet! I haven't cried! I - I can be silent... Don't hurt me...

Id: [0x0023BB37]
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Id: [0x0023BB3E]
The Eagle Bearer is right, <i>mater</i>. Spartan women must be strong.

Id: [0x0023BB4F]
Misthios! Did you ever talk to my husband? If he knows anything about my daughter's disappearance, help him, or... or stop him! Please, do whatever must be done to find my Amara!

Id: [0x0023BB55]
Warriors! Heroes! Mercenaries of all types. Sign up here for the Battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x0023BB5A]
Would you like to be rich? Are you the next Champion?

Id: [0x0023BB5F]
You, <i>misthios</i>. You look like a true contender.

Id: [0x0023BB6A]
This one's all alone.

Id: [0x0023BB6B]
Get her!

Id: [0x0023BB70]
Keep fighting, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023BB75]
Ah, the <i>misthios</i> arrives. Then we can begin.

Id: [0x0023BB7A]
Ah, more fresh blood.

Id: [0x0023BB7B]
By the look of these warriors, this Battle of One Hundred Hands is going to be one for the ages. Indeed, I think it will have people talking for years.

Id: [0x0023BB7C]
Your gear could be the difference between victory or death. Don't forget to visit Gernadios for the best weapons and armor.

Id: [0x0023BB7E]
Thanks, Drakios.

Id: [0x0023BB7F]
Prepare, warriors. The Battle will commence soon.

Id: [0x0023BB8D]
Well, aren't you something nice to look at? [beat]I'm Odessa... as in <i>Odysseus</i>.

Id: [0x0023BB8E]
These lawless wilds are insufferable. Bandits, wolves, pirates, sharks... The hills and waters call out for Spartan discipline... Not to mention, the gutless Athenians who've let this place run amok.

Id: [0x0023BB8F]
Only a Spartan would think they can tame the wild.

Id: [0x0023BB90]
In Sparta, there is order. There is discipline. It is the gods' will that we bring structure to the chaos.

Id: [0x0023BB98]
Followers of Ares are operating at a shrine in that cave, <i>misthios</i>. They've been making locals disappear.

Id: [0x0023BB9E]
I've made a person or two disappear in my time. But they deserved it.

Id: [0x0023BBA0]
Someone needs to help the locals.

Id: [0x0023BBA2]
I've written a report detailing their position on this papyrus for my commander, but I can't let them slip away while I deliver it.

Id: [0x0023BBF3]
These Athenians are a blight on the land.

Id: [0x0023BBF4]
And what are you doing about this blight?

Id: [0x0023BBF5]
I have scouted their camps. Their boats. Their supplies... Even their upper ranks. I would burn it all if I could, but I can't compromise my position.

Id: [0x0023BEF6]
I have scouted the enemy. I found Athenian and bandit camps.

Id: [0x0023BEF7]
What else did you discover?

Id: [0x0023BEF8]
There are too few corpses.

Id: [0x0023BF01]
The Athenians still have too much influence on the civilians here. They spy on us and steal supplies when we patrol.

Id: [0x0023BF07]
People have suffered in this war, Spartan.

Id: [0x0023BF0A]
If you don't take action now, things will only get worse.

Id: [0x0023BF18]
Kassandra! I haven't seen you since you took me to the ruins of Odysseus.

Id: [0x0023BF19]
Odessa. You remember.

Id: [0x0023BF1D]
So, my West Wind returns.

Id: [0x0023BF1E]
It seems I've picked up your taste for treasure hunting.

Id: [0x0023BF1F]
Is there no greater passion?

Id: [0x0023BF20]
So, what do you have for me?

Id: [0x0023BF21]
A group of bandits has put their hands on Triton's conch shell. They think it has the power to control the tides. Many would want such a thing. Will you bring it to me?

Id: [0x0023BF2B]
One day, you'll see everything I was working toward, and you'll know you helped make it happen. Attika and lands far beyond will thank you, even if they don't know your name.

Id: [0x0023BF2C]
What's it like, being a mercenary?

Id: [0x0023BF2D]
I do what I must to get by.

Id: [0x0023BF2E]
My brother said the same thing about being a man in Sparta. We learn to fight, to die for our family and our country... [beat]I can't wait!

Id: [0x0023BF2F]
You love your home, eh?

Id: [0x0023BF30]
I do. We are strong and we are free! And any man would happily give his life for his city, his fellow soldiers, and his children.

Id: [0x0023BF43]
From your lips to the gods' ears, it will be in your possession.

Id: [0x0023BF44]
How could I forget? You told me to live my own life and care less about someone else's greatness.

Id: [0x0023BF45]
Looks like you're taking my advice.

Id: [0x0023BF46]
I've been forced to take care of my sick father. So, no, I've had no chance to live the life I desire.

Id: [0x0023BF47]
Of course I do. You told me to stay home with my family.

Id: [0x0023BF48]
Seems like you're doing that.

Id: [0x0023BF49]
Not by choice. You asked if I wanted to be remembered or to be happy. Well, taking care of my sick father does not make me happy.

Id: [0x0023BF4B]
I'm in the middle of something.

Id: [0x0023BF51]
My role is to breathe life into the ancients.

Id: [0x0023BF56]
Words of madmen... Perhaps the next pieces will tell us more.

Id: [0x0023BF58]
My orders are to stow away on a vessel and deliver this tablet to a contact posing as a docker in Athens.

Id: [0x0023BF5E]
Safe travels, then.

Id: [0x0023BF60]
What has your voyage got to do with me?

Id: [0x0023BF62]
I hate boats, <i>misthios</i>. It shames me, but I cannot make this voyage.

Id: [0x0023BF6C]
Yes, although you were hardly any help. I've had nobody to push me to greatness, and now I'm stuck taking care of my sick father.

Id: [0x0023BF73]
I am of the krypteia. I strike from the shadows at precise targets. Tell me, <i>misthios</i>, can you kill in silence?

Id: [0x0023BF79]
I don't need to hide to hit my mark.

Id: [0x0023BF7B]
I can strike easily from the shadows... for a price.

Id: [0x0023BF7D]
I've been gathering information on vulnerable Athenian camps and their commanders, but I can't hit them all.

Id: [0x0023BF8B]
Pirates have been preying on every ship up the coast, but recently, I've spotted a man who looks an awful lot like their captain drinking in this port.

Id: [0x0023BF8C]
Sounds like you should strike.

Id: [0x0023BF8D]
I can't take care of the captain without tipping the crew off. Or compromising my cover.

Id: [0x0023C0A4]
The Followers of Ares and bandits in this area have grown bold. They've found me out and are threatening to expose me as a spy to the Athenians if I don't pay them off.

Id: [0x0023C0AF]
Be glad you have family to take care of.

Id: [0x0023C0B0]
Says the one who gets to travel and make a name for herself. Nobody knows who <i>I</i> am.

Id: [0x0023C0B1]
No wonder you're upset. You want to be out exploring, but you're stuck here instead.

Id: [0x0023C0B2]
I'm glad somebody gets it.

Id: [0x0023C0B3]
I've seen a lot of people, but you're one of the most beautiful I've ever met.

Id: [0x0023C0B4]
Is that so? You're a welcome distraction from my problems.

Id: [0x0023C0B5]
If you don't like it, do something about it.

Id: [0x0023C0B6]
Not until my father is better. I need to get a couple of things for him. Maybe you could help me?

Id: [0x0023C0B7]
If you have some time, maybe we could get to know each other a little better.

Id: [0x0023C0B8]
Tell me more.

Id: [0x0023C0B9]
Well, I can think of a few things, but... let's talk some more first.

Id: [0x0023C0BA]
Yeah... That sounds... great.

Id: [0x0023C0BB]
I've been told I'm great at being a distraction. I'm sure you have a bed inside we could use.

Id: [0x0023C0BC]
[&laughs]You get straight to the point, don't you?

Id: [0x0023C0BD]
I'll show you how to the point I can get.

Id: [0x0023C0BE]
I'm sure you will.

Id: [0x0023C0BF]
Are there any goats around here?

Id: [0x0023C0C0]
Why...

Id: [0x0023C0C1]
A man named Alkibiades once showed me something. It was a... memorable experience.

Id: [0x0023C0C2]
Oh my! You're a funny one. I didn't get that feeling from you.

Id: [0x0023C0C3]
So, how about it?

Id: [0x0023C0C4]
You know, I'd <i>love</i> to, but I have a couple of things I need to pick up for my father first. If you helped me, then we could <i>maybe </i>continue our conversation.

Id: [0x0023C0C7]
Don't worry, I'm here to help. What do you need?

Id: [0x0023C0C8]
A few herbs from the Valley of King Lelex nearby. I also need a mixture from the market to combine with the herbs. There's a merchant there holding onto it for me.

Id: [0x0023C0C9]
Is your father really so sick you can't get them yourself?

Id: [0x0023C0CA]
I'm his only child. I'd rather be close by in case he gets worse.

Id: [0x0023C0CB]
Fetch your own stuff.

Id: [0x0023C0CD]
Do you know what's wrong with him?

Id: [0x0023C0CE]
No, only that he's not getting better. The mixture and herbs I need may help the pain at least.

Id: [0x0023C0CF]
If he dies, all his land will be yours, right?

Id: [0x0023C0D0]
Yes, but I'd sell it anyway. What better reason to leave everything behind and truly begin my quest like Odysseus?

Id: [0x0023C0D1]
Stay by your father. I'll be back with the herbs and the mixture.

Id: [0x0023C0D4]
You know, you aren't so different from those of us in the krypteia, the shadows of Sparta.

Id: [0x0023C0DA]
You strike from the shadows. I <i>am</i> the shadow. We are worlds apart.

Id: [0x0023C0DC]
We both work from the shadows, I'll give you that.

Id: [0x0023C0DE]
We'll be all right if we watch out for each other. Which reminds me! The thugs said <i>you </i>should watch your back.

Id: [0x0023C0E0]
Well, there are long shadows in Athens. And many targets: politicians, leaders, commanders. More than one person can see to...

Id: [0x0023C0E2]
You worry too much.

Id: [0x0023C0E3]
You don't worry <i>enough</i>.

Id: [0x0023C0EB]
<i>Chaire</i>. I bring you a new charge, Trainer.

Id: [0x0023C0EC]
Makarios, son of Serios.

Id: [0x0023C0ED]
Yes sir! I can't wait to see my brother -

Id: [0x0023C0EE]
Quiet, boy. No questions. You'll focus on your own lessons and duties, and speak when spoken to.

Id: [0x0023C0EF]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x0023C0F0]
Now, <i>misthios</i>, you look like you've been in a few scrapes.

Id: [0x0023C0F7]
Thank you for that, by the way.

Id: [0x0023C0F8]
He survived the party, and you got him home safely... but it didn't matter in the end.

Id: [0x0023C0F9]
You know how to talk to a <i>misthios</i>. Is that all you want, the mandrake herbs?

Id: [0x0023C0FA]
For now. Bring them back to me, and I'll package them for my patients. Then we'll see.

Id: [0x0023C0FE]
Even though you didn't say Diodoros is the one who sent the package, I still managed to get what I want.

Id: [0x0023C100]
And my plan worked, thanks to you.

Id: [0x0023C103]
Are the herbs and mixture okay? You did get them, didn't you?

Id: [0x0023C106]
Did you need something?

Id: [0x0023C107]
I knew you'd want to help my father.

Id: [0x0023C10A]
Apparently you've been causing some problems for Megaris.

Id: [0x0023C10D]
Megaris deserves everything it's gotten! I'm the victim here.

Id: [0x0023C10E]
The leader doesn't think so.

Id: [0x0023C10F]
That they were after you and only you. Not me.

Id: [0x0023C110]
I can't believe it!

Id: [0x0023C111]
Looks like it deals with your father's estate. They probably want you and him both gone so they can take it.

Id: [0x0023C112]
I could have died. Without making a name for myself. I'd never be worth anything at all.

Id: [0x0023C20A]
A Spartan ship was sunk just off the coast. The warriors on board will never see battle again, but their weapons still could. The ship was carrying a chest with their gear.

Id: [0x0023C20B]
So go get them.

Id: [0x0023C20C]
Spartans weren't made for fighting the sharks in these waters.

Id: [0x0023C254]
Delians have suffered for so long. This is the first time I've felt happiness since the war began.

Id: [0x0023C255]
You can bring that to your people. These islands deserve peace - so do you.

Id: [0x0023C256]
And what about you? When this is all done, we could always use another set of capable hands.

Id: [0x0023C257]
My journey isn't over yet, but I may settle down some day.

Id: [0x0023C258]
You can do many things, <i>misthios</i>. But settle down? I'm not so sure.

Id: [0x0023C259]
Another challenge?

Id: [0x0023C25A]
Stop looking to the future to be happy, when true happiness is right in front of you. You taught me that.

Id: [0x0023C25C]
The West Wind! Are you here to retrieve Triton's conch shell for me?

Id: [0x0023C25F]
Look around you.

Id: [0x0023C260]
I see nothing. What do you see?

Id: [0x0023C266]
ALEXIOS

Id: [0x0023C267]
KASSANDRA

Id: [0x0023C268]
What's the difference between a dog and an Athenian?

Id: [0x0023C269]
I don't know.

Id: [0x0023C26A]
If you kill his master, the dog will bite you... But these Athenians will run like cowards without their leaders. Let's put another dent in their upper ranks.

Id: [0x0023C26E]
Rest in Elysium, Kyra.

Id: [0x0023C272]
Please, my patients need those mandrake herbs.

Id: [0x0023C274]
People tried to kill me because of you, but you're only thinking about yourself.

Id: [0x0023C275]
You can handle it. There was never any true risk.

Id: [0x0023C276]
It's a good thing I came back in time.

Id: [0x0023C277]
I'm grateful you did.

Id: [0x0023C278]
I won't let anyone hurt that face.

Id: [0x0023C279]
No pain, no glory.

Id: [0x0023C27A]
I don't know if I agree. But maybe you can change my mind.

Id: [0x0023C27B]
I would, but this news is weighing on me.

Id: [0x0023C27C]
How about you take me inside and show me a little pain?

Id: [0x0023C27D]
Oh, how I would love to do so, but this news... someone aims to kill me! How could we possibly ignore such a thing for pleasure?

Id: [0x0023C280]
Then where does that leave us?

Id: [0x0023C283]
Here, I found your herbs.

Id: [0x0023C284]
With a task at hand, clearly! Think what you must, but I can prove the truth to you. I just need your help.

Id: [0x0023C285]
I'm not surprised. I'll let you know if you can have it.

Exactly. Wars have been fought over those words. She can't be left unpunished. I...

Id: [0x0023C30C]
My family was torn apart by a false prophecy. If it was one of hers, I may take matters into my own hands.

Id: [0x0023C364]
Get out of here, Lykaon. I know what you want to do. You'll just bring more shame on our family.

Id: [0x0023C365]
It's out of your hands anyway. Some strange men were searching the village today, looking for her. I brought them here, and they dragged her away.

Id: [0x0023C366]
You wouldn't understand, she was an impious old fool. Now we have nothing more to worry about. Who are you, anyway?

Id: [0x0023C36C]
I've been posing as an aide to one of the local officials. I was to sow discord and make him look like a traitor.

Id: [0x0023C36D]
Did it work?

Id: [0x0023C36E]
Too well! I'm afraid for him, <i>misthios</i>. He is a good man - despite my mission I do not want to see him imprisoned or killed by the Athenians.

Id: [0x0023C370]
If we don't find her, we can't settle any of this. Please help me figure out where she's been taken.

Id: [0x0023C37D]
A scrape or two... hundred. I like to think I've given as good as I've gotten.

Id: [0x0023C37E]
Ha! Spoken like a true warrior. What say we give these summer youths a spectacle? Show them a clash of Titans?

Id: [0x0023C384]
The Athenians are losing their grip on the region, but their coffers run deep.

Id: [0x0023C38A]
If they have more drachmae than you, I should talk to them instead.

Id: [0x0023C38B]
I shouldn't have expected any more from a dishonorable mercenary.

Id: [0x0023C38D]
Drachmae might be important, but honor and bravery are more valuable.

Id: [0x0023C38E]
Spoken like a true Spartan. I knew you'd understand the situation.

Id: [0x0023C390]
What do you need doing?

Id: [0x0023C391]
As long as they have supplies and drachmae, the Athenians can still hang on. Not to mention their growing numbers...

Id: [0x0023C39C]
I don't waste breath describing my exploits or trying to scare children.

Id: [0x0023C39D]
You speak like a Spartan. Let's see if you've learned anything else.

Id: [0x0023C3A2]
Let's give these kids a show they'll sing of for years.

Id: [0x0023C3A3]
I'm no child for you to loom over. Feel no shame when you ask for mercy, old man.

Id: [0x0023C3AA]
I am.

Id: [0x0023C3AB]
I am Xanthe, Magistrate of Pitana. I have a noble task befitting someone of your high station. My son is to start his military training at the <i>agoge</i>.

Id: [0x0023C3AC]
And they say Spartans don't speak sweetly.

Id: [0x0023C3C3]
Now that we know you can fight... I have a serious matter to discuss.

Id: [0x0023C3C5]
Oh?

Id: [0x0023C3C6]
Two of my older students have gone missing, and I need someone I can trust to find them.

Id: [0x0023C3CD]
I can look for them. Tell me what I need to know.

Id: [0x0023C3D2]
The two students who are missing are called Akamas and Theoros.

Id: [0x0023C3D3]
Theoros? Makarios's brother?

Id: [0x0023C3D4]
The same. I fear I have failed the magistrate.

Id: [0x0023C3D5]
I'll look at the campsite and see what I can find.

Id: [0x0023C3D8]
My duty was to bring Makarios here. I don't have time to help you now.

Id: [0x0023C3DF]
Your help finding my missing students would be welcome.

Id: [0x0023C3E6]
You'll come to expect this from me. The impossible made possible.

Id: [0x0023C3E9]
So, can I... Can I keep these?

Id: [0x0023C3EB]
One of Homer's heroes.

Id: [0x0023C3EC]
Yes! He had a golden eagle feather, a gift from Zeus.

Id: [0x0023C3ED]
And why do you care about it?

Id: [0x0023C3EE]
It is a rare reminder of a glorious age. And so deserves to be in my grasp. Take these maps and see if you can find it.

Id: [0x0023C3F1]
I'll deal with them.

Id: [0x0023C3F2]
Oh, no. There are too many of them!

Id: [0x0023C3F5]
The Terrors of Kyknos will no longer bother you.

Id: [0x0023C3F6]
May Zeus bless you!

Id: [0x0023C3FA]
Glad you're happy. Now, my pay?

Id: [0x0023C3FB]
Calm yourself. Here, for your trouble.

Id: [0x0023C3FC]
Thanks.

Id: [0x0023C404]
I've got the pearls and the shiny stones. I should return to the little girl.

Id: [0x0023C406]
I'm sorry, child. I could not break your heart, even if it was good for you.

Id: [0x0023C408]
Go<i> away!</i>

Id: [0x0023C40B]
She's dead, <i>misthios</i>...

Id: [0x0023C413]
Woooow! You made this doll on your own?

Id: [0x0023C414]
Y-yes! I make them out of clay.

Id: [0x0023C415]
Can you make one for me, too?

Id: [0x0023C416]
Me too! Make one for me too! Then we can all play with them together!

Id: [0x0023C417]
Sure!

Id: [0x0023C41B]
They're gone.

Id: [0x0023C41C]
It rained... It rained and -

Id: [0x0023C41D]
My friends disappeared again.

Id: [0x0023C420]
I need to do something, <i>anything!</i>

Id: [0x0023C424]
There's a spot down here where I used to hunt as a young girl. It was hunt or starve in those days.

Id: [0x0023C425]
[&scoff]Same for me. I started by catching and cooking rodents.

Id: [0x0023C426]
Ha! They make a good soup. But look how far you've come.

Id: [0x0023C427]
How far <i>we've</i> come.

Id: [0x0023C428]
There. Isn't it beautiful?

Id: [0x0023C42B]
It is. Now show me how you use that bow.

Id: [0x0023C433]
Oh? What would he offer the gods, and why?

Id: [0x0023C434]
The why is unimportant. Perhaps he asks the gods to make his drachmae multiply, or to harden his cock.

Id: [0x0023C437]
But the offering is said to be a crafted golden bracelet, as beautiful as Aphrodite, with workmanship to rival that of Hephaistos. It would look better on my wrist than on an altar.<LF>

Id: [0x0023C439]
Probably not, though I suppose you risk offending the gods and earning their enmity for all time. If you take stock in that sort of thing.[&laughs]

Id: [0x0023C43B]
Hey!

Id: [0x0023C43C]
You wanted to get into my clothes, you mean!

Id: [0x0023C43D]
HEY!

Id: [0x0023C43F]
Huh? What do you want?

Id: [0x0023C440]
I couldn't find the bracelet.

Id: [0x0023C442]
Maybe because every goat-herder around could hear your spat? Give me the bracelet.

Id: [0x0023C443]
You don't scare me!

Id: [0x0023C445]
Where?

Id: [0x0023C44A]
Exactly! Give me what I want or I will smite you down!

Id: [0x0023C44B]
And what do you want?

Id: [0x0023C44C]
Fool! She wants the bracelet you stole!

Id: [0x0023C44D]
You understand completely! Give me the bracelet!

Id: [0x0023C44E]
I threw it off the cliffs, into the sea.

Id: [0x0023C44F]
<i>Maláka</i>. Guess I'm going for a swim.

Id: [0x0023C4A0]
When your brother died, did you... did you see his body?

Id: [0x0023C4BB]
...Right.

Id: [0x0023C4F8]
Did I hear 5,000 drachmae?! That's a steal, folks! A steal! You, sir! You're clearly a man of great wealth and taste - for a mere 5,000 drachmae, think of the life - the comfort - this slave would afford you!

Id: [0x0023C501]
4,500.

Id: [0x0023C502]
Sold!

Id: [0x0023C506]
2,000 drachmae?! Surely they're worth another 500 drachmae?!

Id: [0x0023C507]
2,500!

Id: [0x0023C508]
3,000! <i>3,000!</i>

Id: [0x0023C50F]
Not only is life easier and safer with a slave, it's <i>more rewarding! </i>You're not just purchasing highly skilled workers, you're purchasing <i>family!</i>

Id: [0x0023C513]
A slave's work is never done.

Id: [0x0023C520]
These slaves are local - straight from Eretria! They're experienced workers, formerly part of the rebuild happening right now. They could be yours! Don't let their skills go waste! We start the bidding at 500 drachmae per slave!

Id: [0x0023C524]
You're busy people, doing your best to keep up in today's relentless world. With a slave to call your own, you'll have the advantage you need to get ahead!

Id: [0x0023C52A]
I long for the days before The Dagger.

Id: [0x0023C52B]
<i>Quiet!</i> Do you want to get yourself killed?

Id: [0x0023C52D]
Surely they're worth 1,500 drachmae!

Id: [0x0023C52E]
...1,200?

Id: [0x0023C52F]
Sir, this is a set - you get husband and wife together!

Id: [0x0023C530]
[beat]1,250.

Id: [0x0023C531]
Deal!

Id: [0x0023C53A]
Put your backs into it. Eretria isn't going to rebuild itself.

Id: [0x0023C540]
The amount of times this boy's been "too sick to work" only to hear, <i>not two hours later</i>, he's in the fields with his friends. By Zeus!

Id: [0x0023C541]
He's grown since you've been gone. He's not a kid anymore.

Id: [0x0023C542]
Ah, but still up to his old tricks, if you ask me.

Id: [0x0023C547]
But can they read? Write?

Id: [0x0023C548]
Well, uh, one can!

Id: [0x0023C549]
Really?

Id: [0x0023C54A]
...Yes!

Id: [0x0023C54B]
300 drachmae for the lot.

Id: [0x0023C54C]
Sold!

Id: [0x0023C552]
Help! Somebody help me!

Id: [0x0023C554]
Listen to reason, Barnabas. I saw him vomiting myself. And now he's like this!

Id: [0x0023C558]
This must be Theageneses, the founder of this training school.

Id: [0x0023C55A]
500 drachmae!

Id: [0x0023C55B]
510!

Id: [0x0023C55C]
515!

Id: [0x0023C55D]
Please, please, these aren't legless goats - these are strong, educated, and quite willing workers.

Id: [0x0023C55F]
520.

Id: [0x0023C560]
Sold!

Id: [0x0023C56D]
Do these look like <i>Pephkan </i>slaves to you?! [beat, calmer]250 drachmae, minimum.

Id: [0x0023C574]
A burned patch. Someone dropped a torch in surprise.

Id: [0x0023C575]
Theageneses was the best! Euthymos didn't even stand a chance in that match. Look at how weak he is!

Id: [0x0023C576]
Euthymos... That name seems familiar somehow...

Id: [0x0023C578]
A body. Hmm. He doesn't look much like Makarios or Xanthe. Must be the other boy.

Id: [0x0023C57A]
Signs of battle.

Id: [0x0023C580]
How much for the pair?

Id: [0x0023C581]
2,500 drachmae.

Id: [0x0023C582]
1,000 for the shorter one.

Id: [0x0023C584]
Please, don't separate us. He's my little brother. He needs me. He can work. I promise he can work.

Id: [0x0023C586]
2,000 for the pair?

Id: [0x0023C587]
No, just the short one.

Id: [0x0023C589]
Here we have slaves whose homes have been ravaged by the hubris of Sparta and Athens. Who will start the bidding?

Id: [0x0023C590]
He's faking it, Mikkos. I've seen this routine before. Gods! Grant me Penelope's patience.

Id: [0x0023C592]
It's not just Neleus. There have been others. All promising young athletes turning up sick or missing. Something's not right in Thasos.

Id: [0x0023C593]
I did "spar" with an athlete trainer on Thasos. He told me there have been strange things going on. People choosing top athletes for a mysterious purpose.

Id: [0x0023C597]
Do I hear 750 drachmae? Only 750 drachmae! You'll never get a deal this good in Athens!

Id: [0x0023C59E]
Come see the finest slaves this side of the Acropolis!

Id: [0x0023C5AB]
Please, don't interrupt the bidding.

Id: [0x0023C5AD]
You're breaking my flow!

Id: [0x0023C5B2]
Yes! I'd hoped there might be clues to be found at the Champion's Gymnasium on Thasos.

Id: [0x0023C5B6]
I-I'm sorry, you're covered in scars. I'd just rather be... someone else's slave.

Id: [0x0023C5BB]
You're not buying me... are you?

Id: [0x0023C5C1]
It feels like I've lived my whole life in this market[2413113]. [beat]Why does no one want me?

Id: [0x0023C5C6]
Have you heard? Agapios and his master are trying to stop The Dagger.

Id: [0x0023C5CB]
Dangerous work, that is.

Id: [0x0023C5CE]
My gratitude, warrior. I was certain I would not see another day.

Id: [0x0023C5CF]
What's your name?

Id: [0x0023C5D1]
Theoros.

Id: [0x0023C5DE]
Keep your eyes on your work.

Id: [0x0023C5E4]
Better a slave here than homeless in Lesbos. That place is [beat]terrifying.

Id: [0x0023C5E9]
I just hope I go to a good home.

Id: [0x0023C5EE]
I'll get back to Thasos, one day.

Id: [0x0023C5F3]
Kill them. Kill them all!

Id: [0x0023C5F8]
Trainer Iatrokles will want to know what happened to you and your companion.

Id: [0x0023C5F9]
My age-mate, Akamas, was killed by these dogs when we saw them sneaking about in the night.

Id: [0x0023C5FA]
And what happened to you?

Id: [0x0023C5FB]
I fell in combat, and they dragged me here.

Id: [0x0023C60B]
Who are those men after?

Id: [0x0023C60C]
As long as it's not me, I couldn't give a shit.

Id: [0x0023C610]
Your brother worships you and will be overjoyed to see you.

Id: [0x0023C611]
Makarios? Has the time come for him to join the <i>agoge</i> already?

Id: [0x0023C612]
Yes, he already studies with Trainer Iatrokles.

Id: [0x0023C613]
Curse all of Olympos! He isn't ready for this.

Id: [0x0023C627]
I saw the battlefield. You ran as soon as your companion fell. A Spartan never drops his shield.

Id: [0x0023C629]
Curse you. Yes! I don't want to be a soldier, I never wanted to! All I wanted was a small boat, a small life. To fish and live in peace.

Id: [0x0023C62A]
A fisherman?! I came all this way for a coward?

Id: [0x0023C62B]
So what? I didn't ask for this. It was forced upon me. A boy in Sparta has no other choice.

Id: [0x0023C62C]
Your mother and Makarios will be disgusted by you.

Id: [0x0023C62D]
At least I'll be alive to pray for them and love them from afar. Thank you for my life, <i>misthios</i>, but tell them I'm not coming back.

Id: [0x0023C633]
Your brother, Makarios, will be glad to see you alive. And he'll be impressed by your bravery.

Id: [0x0023C635]
Makarios is at the <i>agoge</i>?

Id: [0x0023C636]
I escorted him there myself, on behalf of your mother. He's a bright boy. Eager to learn from the brother he favors so much.

Id: [0x0023C637]
I don't know if I can face them all again...

Id: [0x0023C638]
Of course you can. Remember, the trick is just to keep breathing. Put your body in a state of fearlessness, and your mind will be free of fear.

Id: [0x0023C63A]
I don't need your drachmae, I spread the word of Hekate freely. But -

Id: [0x0023C63B]
Just. For. You.

Id: [0x0023C64A]
Will you be a Spartan and retrieve your shield and your place in the line, or will you run off and offend the gods, leaving your duty behind?

Id: [0x0023C64C]
If the gods are offended by my choices, they should never have put me in this skin! I never wanted to be a warrior.

Id: [0x0023C64D]
We do what we must in this world, not what we want.

Id: [0x0023C64E]
I must leave Sparta, then, or else die by slow suicide. Thank you for my life, but tell my mother I won't return!

Id: [0x0023C651]
The world is tough. But if we look out for those we love, we can shield them from at least a little harm.

Id: [0x0023C653]
I do not know that I can face my brother - all my brothers - again.

Id: [0x0023C654]
Of course you can. Makarios worships you. But you can use that love to fuel your bravery and defeat your fear.

Id: [0x0023C666]
Wine and wild mushrooms. That's all of it. I should go to the girl and the witch at the temple[2378806].

Id: [0x0023C668]
Yes, Aetios. Yes... We will be. I will protect our happiness at any cost.

Id: [0x0023C66A]
You believe she's innocent in all this?

Id: [0x0023C66B]
She tried to get ahead with <i>magic.</i>

Id: [0x0023C66C]
So, spare me the hypocrisy. Just leave and take your bald friend with you.

Id: [0x0023C673]
You... make a fair point.

Id: [0x0023C674]
What?! How could you say that! She's a liar! And a cheat!

Id: [0x0023C676]
Come, my Aetios, my dear. Let us leave these peasants to their theatrics. We have a wedding to plan.

Id: [0x0023C677]
See? The <i>misthios</i> gets it.

Id: [0x0023C67F]
Who were those men?

Id: [0x0023C680]
It's better not knowing.

Id: [0x0023C683]
Did... did you find him?

Id: [0x0023C68A]
W-what? I've known her all my life. She's a witch? That explains a lot...

Id: [0x0023C6A2]
I feel like the luckiest man alive!

Id: [0x0023C6A3]
Oh, Aetios, how I've dreamed of this day.

Id: [0x0023C6A5]
What have you done to my wife?! You'll pay for this, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0023C6A8]
Those men. Are they from The...

Id: [0x0023C6A9]
Do not. Say it.

Id: [0x0023C6B0]
When are those supplies arriving? I'm running out of clay.

Id: [0x0023C6B7]
We've got lumber coming from Lesbos in a couple days. I need to hear more hammering.

Id: [0x0023C6BA]
You can almost feel the tides changing for the better.

Id: [0x0023C6C4]
[&ah]The important item The Dagger were after was... a dagger?

Id: [0x0023C6C5]
Agapios will know when I show the blade to him. You should find a safe place to lie low until this is over.

Id: [0x0023C6C7]
How about we put our skills to the test?

Id: [0x0023C6C8]
Help me talk sense into him, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023C6C9]
I'd rather not waste my time or my skills on the likes of a nobody.

Id: [0x0023C6CA]
Yes, you're looking at an Olympic champion.

Id: [0x0023C6CC]
Of course I'm an Olympic champion. Many times over, in fact.

Id: [0x0023C6CE]
Get back to your traini -

Id: [0x0023C6CF]
You're amazing! Tell us, what do we need to do to be a true champion?

Id: [0x0023C6D0]
A true champion needs a dominant power pose. Like so.

Id: [0x0023C6D1]
Power pose?

Id: [0x0023C6D9]
A true champion runs daily with the weight of two cows slung across the shoulders.

Id: [0x0023C6DA]
What will you do once The Dagger's gone?

Id: [0x0023C6DB]
Anyone can be a champion. But it takes hard work and a commitment to your passion.

Id: [0x0023C6DD]
That is what I <i>always</i> say!

Id: [0x0023C6E4]
So, an Olympic champion strolls into my school, steals my thunder, and dares to challenge me, the great Euthymos?

Id: [0x0023C6FE]
Yes, yes, if you've got important business, speak to my assistant, Agapios. He's probably near the Chalkis Warehouse.

Id: [0x0023C6FF]
You know your nephew best, and it sounds like he needs a firm hand.

Id: [0x0023C701]
I thought his caretaker could handle him, but apparently I was wrong.

Id: [0x0023C702]
Come on Barnabas. He's plainly ill.

Id: [0x0023C704]
Bah! I'll be at the ship when Neleus snaps out of it.

Id: [0x0023C707]
Does the great Euthymos accept this challenge, or is he too afraid?

Id: [0x0023C708]
Afraid?

Id: [0x0023C71C]
At this rate, Eretria will be good as new in no time.

Id: [0x0023C73E]
When we were young, when we'd play, I was the Robin, and the Kingfisher... was my brother. [beat]But he died, he-he... should be dead. I mourned him. I made him a grave!

Id: [0x0023C740]
Please tell me he's not one of <i>them</i>. I beg you, tell me my brother's not a Dagger!

Id: [0x0023C741]
Your brother is likely involved in this, Agapios. If he is the Kingfisher, he's working with The Dagger.

Id: [0x0023C742]
No. That's not the boy I knew. He protected me, <i>saved </i>me. He's - whoever this Kingfisher is, it can't be my brother.

Id: [0x0023C744]
Maybe you should be a bit easier on your nephew this time. He really does seem sick.

Id: [0x0023C746]
You know your brother better than these records. If you believe <i>this</i> Kingfisher isn't him, then you're right.

Id: [0x0023C749]
Your brother can't have been born the "Kingfisher."

Id: [0x0023C74A]
Of course he wasn't! Neritos. His name was Neritos. Older than me -

Id: [0x0023C74D]
Thank you, yes. The boy I knew - there's no way he could be involved in this.

Id: [0x0023C74F]
No, no body at all. No sign, no word, nothing. After <i>mater</i> died, <i>pater</i> was... not as fit to feed us as he once was, so my brother made sure we never went hungry. He would fish, every day. [beat]Until he didn't return.

Id: [0x0023C752]
More trouble than me, too. Fighting, stealing -

Id: [0x0023C754]
But he always looked out for me.

Id: [0x0023C75D]
You look strong enough. Can you help me?

Id: [0x0023C75E]
Depends on what you need.

Id: [0x0023C762]
You should tear this Kingfisher open with his own blades and hang the corpse as a warning to any who would dare cross Euboea.

Id: [0x0023C779]
My West Wind, you have shown a keen nose for hunting treasure. I'm hoping to rely on you now for more personal work.

Id: [0x0023C788]
Now the world is spinning and bouncing.

Id: [0x0023C78D]
Why did you bring me here?

Id: [0x0023C792]
Is this really where he lives?

Id: [0x0023C796]
Ha, it's exactly like we were told! Get him!

Id: [0x0023C79A]
Wait, why are we going this way?

Id: [0x0023C79E]
Are you sure this is the right way? It doesn't look familiar.

Id: [0x0023C7A9]
Stop her! She robbed me!

Id: [0x0023C7AF]
I'm glad we aren't going by sea.

Id: [0x0023C7B4]
Alkibiades told me about you. He said you're blessed by the gods.

Id: [0x0023C7B9]
It's nice of you to help someone you don't know at all.

Id: [0x0023C7BD]
We should stay on the safest route possible.

Id: [0x0023C7CB]
Enough! We've gained ground on the backs of fallen Spartans.

Id: [0x0023C7CD]
You! What's your reason for being here?

Id: [0x0023C7CE]
I'm talking to <i>you</i>! Present yourself!

Id: [0x0023C7D0]
More than some cowering dog.

Id: [0x0023C7D6]
Choose another path, traveler. The way ahead is not safe.

Id: [0x0023C7D7]
What's the problem?

Id: [0x0023C7D8]
A creature beyond the understanding of mortals claims these grounds. You have been warned.

Id: [0x0023C7DE]
I hope you have a coin for the Ferryman.

Id: [0x0023C7E4]
We should talk, you and I.

Id: [0x0023C7ED]
Kassandra, join us!

Id: [0x0023C7F0]
Good. I might not have <i>approval</i> to deploy our men to do this, but I'm not about to let that stop me.

Id: [0x0023C7F1]
I had a disagreement with my second in command. He went out into the forest to clear his head and still hasn't returned.

Id: [0x0023C7F2]
Maybe he needs more time.

Id: [0x0023C7F3]
There's a camp of bandits in these parts. If that fool hasn't come back yet, he's gotten himself captured.

Id: [0x0023C807]
My scouts say a farmer is sick. The food he's harvested may also be contaminated.

Id: [0x0023C808]
Then it shouldn't be sold.

Id: [0x0023C809]
Unfortunately, it's already been distributed to merchants for transport... And that fool farmer is still wandering through town spreading his infection.

Id: [0x0023C81A]
I've killed enough people to know that violence has no end. Better to move on and make the best of the lives the gods have given you.

Id: [0x0023C81B]
You're right, Kassandra. I might not be able to forgive my grandmother, not right away. But she can go on with her life, and I with mine.

Id: [0x0023C81C]
I think you've made the right decision, Lykaon.

Id: [0x0023C820]
Athenian commanders have been dismissed for negligence because of my tactics!

Id: [0x0023C825]
Move on? But you said Praxithea ruined your family...

Id: [0x0023C827]
Thank you for your mercy. I promise I will do good with what's left of my days.

Id: [0x0023C82A]
And then I found you. I know you have your life to live, and I want you to live it. [beat]Who knows, maybe the Fates will bring us together again one day...

Id: [0x0023C830]
Do you know what the greatest strength of our army is?

Id: [0x0023C836]
Their loyalty to one another. Spartans never leave a soldier behind.

Id: [0x0023C838]
Their pride in Sparta. It's a land chosen by Ares and Artemis. Any Spartan soldier will brag about the training and hardships they've survived.

Id: [0x0023C83A]
True... But I was thinking of our secret weapon, the helots. Strong. Quick. Expendable. The best support units Spartan warriors could hope for.

Id: [0x0023C83B]
True, the Spartans owe them much.

Id: [0x0023C83C]
Until they turn against us! There's a band of helots nearby who abandoned their posts. Incited by our contentious new leader, I'm sure...

Id: [0x0023C84F]
The Sanctuary of Olympia! Where the greatest athletes compete for fame and glory.

Id: [0x0023C850]
What in Hades is the commander expecting? I can't defend our spy from Athenians <i>and</i> deliver a report to upper ranks at once!

Id: [0x0023C887]
These huntresses! Like the furies themselves! If they attack again, we'll be annihilated.

Id: [0x0023C894]
One Athenian general dismissed is no reason to stop. These fort commanders need to be cut down. And... remember their seals.

Id: [0x0023C897]
Why are you still here? Go kill the enemy command!

Id: [0x0023C899]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0023C89F]
You're proving a solid ally. There's no time to lose. We need to control the enemy forts...

Id: [0x0023C8A5]
I'll report back as soon as I have the seals in hand.

Id: [0x0023C8A8]
I'm not ready yet.

Id: [0x0023C8AA]
Do you know anything about the bandits that have it?

Id: [0x0023C8AB]
They're bandits. They steal and kill. What more is there to know?

Id: [0x0023C8C7]
If striking their commanders down is working, then I'm ready.

Id: [0x0023C8CA]
I'm not ready yet.

Id: [0x0023C8CD]
Tactics will win this! Target the fort commanders.

Id: [0x0023C8D1]
Supply lines cut. Troops tremble. And I rise through the ranks!

Id: [0x0023C8E5]
And the Athenians think me battle shy!

Id: [0x0023C8E6]
That makes you happy?

Id: [0x0023C8E7]
I held my army back, so they dropped their guard. And then we ran them aground.

Id: [0x0023C8F6]
So I take it the war is going well for you, then?

Id: [0x0023C8F7]
Enough questions.

Id: [0x0023C901]
What will you do if you win?

Id: [0x0023C906]
The war will end if we continue our plan. Are you ready to kill the Athenian fort commanders?

Id: [0x0023C90D]
I'll kill more to end this once and for all.

Id: [0x0023C910]
Not yet. I need to prepare.

Id: [0x0023C912]
They think me battle shy! I'll show them what I'm capable of. Start with destroying more of their command.

Id: [0x0023C920]
Your mistake is believing success will make us friends.

Id: [0x0023C948]
Sparta is the only sure winner here.

Id: [0x0023C94B]
I'm considering my options.

Id: [0x0023C95A]
Sparta is landlocked. We rule the land, but naval war is... different.

Id: [0x0023C960]
You won't find victory by complaining.

Id: [0x0023C963]
Sparta needs to adapt to this new battlefront.

Id: [0x0023C96C]
A wonderful idea. I for one, ah, need to rush home. Kassandra, I've cooked up a plan for our Cyclops dilemma. See me when you have time!

Id: [0x0023C97F]
Sounds like quite the story. Is the shell at least made of gold?

Id: [0x0023C980]
My friend, in our time together... Would you think I'd be interested in such an object if it were not made of gold?

Id: [0x0023C981]
Are you sure you're not trying to control the tides?

Id: [0x0023C982]
Only fools think they can move the sea.

Id: [0x0023C984]
The gods can keep Olympos. This is the best view in all the Greek world.

Id: [0x0023C985]
Grandfather was a true hero. Maybe one day they'll sculpt a statue of <i>me</i>.

Id: [0x0023C98D]
Spartans can build as many boats as they like, but Poseidon will never favor them as he does the Athenians.

Id: [0x0023C990]
I can match my bounty and then some, I'm sure.

Id: [0x0023C992]
I never thought I'd find myself back in Sparta. It looks so peaceful despite the war raging elsewhere.

Id: [0x0023C993]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x0023C995]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0023C99B]
This is where everything changed. It's like I never left.

Id: [0x0023C99E]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0023C99F]
Kastor and Polydeukes... A legendary face-off.

Id: [0x0023C9A1]
The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0023C9A3]
So be it.

Id: [0x0023C9A9]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023C9B3]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0023C9B5]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0023C9BB]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0023C9BD]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0023C9BF]
If you want your wood, you'll have to fix my broken bow first.

Id: [0x0023C9C0]
Hmm. I usually only pay when the deed is done, but shit's moving at a snail's pace. Follow me.

Id: [0x0023C9C3]
We are Spartans. The Athenians cannot hope to match us in open combat.

Id: [0x0023C9C4]
Sounds like I can take the day off.

Id: [0x0023C9C5]
What we need is someone behind their lines sabotaging their weapons and boats, and starving them out. We'll take care of the dogs on this side.

Id: [0x0023C9D7]
Hand it over.

Id: [0x0023C9D9]
There you go, good as new! That bow is as strong as Herakles himself. Give it a try.

Id: [0x0023C9DA]
The peasants here pelted two of my soldiers with stones when they went looking for food.

Id: [0x0023C9E0]
I somehow doubt your men asked the "peasants" nicely.

Id: [0x0023C9E2]
The soldiers need to eat if they're going to protect this village.

Id: [0x0023C9E4]
They wouldn't share a single goat with hungry soldiers! An example must be made. Farmer or livestock... A little blood now will prevent my soldiers taking matters into their own hands later.

Id: [0x0023CA00]
Thera. Not what I expected.

Id: [0x0023CA01]
Hephaistos sure seems angry. I wonder if it's because of the war?

Id: [0x0023CA02]
These ruins look old. I wonder who built them and when. [beat]What are those towers?

Id: [0x0023CA03]
By all the gods, it's hot in here.

Id: [0x0023CA04]
What is this place? I've never seen structures like this before.

Id: [0x0023CA05]
This was not built by mortal hands. This is the work of the gods.

Id: [0x0023CA0A]
All right. I did something for you, now you do something for me. Get my wood!

Id: [0x0023CA3F]
It’s said that Herakles himself once defeated fifty men in one strike here in front of the cheering crowd.

Id: [0x0023CA49]
Fair is fair. Are you going to get my wood? Those fucking bandits need a thrashing.

Id: [0x0023CA4C]
Part sanctuary, part treasury. I wonder if the Delians left any silver behind?

Id: [0x0023CA4E]
Three thousand prisoners?

Id: [0x0023CA4F]
Not anymore. They've been executed. [beat]Do you disapprove?

Id: [0x0023CA51]
This fort has seen better days. They should have spent some of that silver on upkeep.

Id: [0x0023CA52]
The Athenians have been hitting our message runners hard. We haven't been able to get a single report through lately.

Id: [0x0023CA53]
You know I'm no simple messenger, Spartan.

Id: [0x0023CA54]
No, but it will be funny if the Athenians think you are. [beat]Though not so funny for them.

Id: [0x0023CA60]
Artemis of the wild land, Mistress of Animals.

Id: [0x0023CA66]
Those lions are impressive. I wonder what they're guarding?

Id: [0x0023CA67]
The birthplace of Apollo himself. Impressive.

Id: [0x0023CA68]
Somebody spared no expense.

Id: [0x0023CA69]
Fair is fair. I'll fix your wood problem.

Id: [0x0023CA6B]
Finally. Markos sure is lucky he's got you as his scapegoat.

Id: [0x0023CA6C]
Mykonos is a lot busier than Kephallonia. Markos would like it here.

Id: [0x0023CA6F]
They'd do it to us.

Id: [0x0023CA70]
So we understand one another then.

Id: [0x0023CA72]
Our actions live on long after we're dead.

Id: [0x0023CA73]
Don't you dare lecture me, Eagle Bearer. The gods approve of my actions.

Id: [0x0023CA76]
You heard Markos. I have to go see him.

Id: [0x0023CA77]
I wouldn't upset me if I were you. I have a working bow now. [beat]I may be back.

Id: [0x0023CA79]
Oh, no you don't, you malákas! I won't be cheated.

Id: [0x0023CA82]
I need your help. I'm going to bring some medicine to Praxithea, my grandmother. Would you please come with me?

Id: [0x0023CA84]
You seem to have a lot on your mind, Lykaon.

Id: [0x0023CA8F]
I'm pretty sure this is more than just a polite visit. But yes, I'll join you.

Id: [0x0023CA93]
I don't have time for this business right now.

Id: [0x0023CA97]
Please come with me when I deliver this medicine.

Id: [0x0023CAB2]
Pephka. [beat]Best keep an eye on my drachmae.

Id: [0x0023CAB4]
Another mercenary?

Id: [0x0023CAB5]
You've had problems with a mercenary?

Id: [0x0023CAB6]
I hired another mercenary to... resolve a dispute with a rival commander. He took my money and ran.

Id: [0x0023CABD]
All right. I'll find them.

Id: [0x0023CABF]
Perfectly.

Id: [0x0023CAC0]
Then I'll leave you to the gods.

Id: [0x0023CAC1]
I'll look for clues.

Id: [0x0023CAC8]
You don't see many heroes like that anymore. 

Id: [0x0023CACC]
Oh look, you're back. Are you going to do his dirty work or not?

Id: [0x0023CAD7]
That must be the farm where Praxithea is being held prisoner.

Id: [0x0023CAD8]
Your Spartan blood boils, does it?

Id: [0x0023CAE8]
You're back. Have you killed them?

Id: [0x0023CAEA]
You again. Have you killed him?

Id: [0x0023CAEC]
You. Have you killed her?

Id: [0x0023CAEE]
<i>Misthios</i>! Has the beast been slain?

Id: [0x0023CAF2]
Were you able to free him?

Id: [0x0023CAF4]
You're back. Were you able to free her?

Id: [0x0023CAFC]
<i>Misthios</i>! Were you able to keep him safe?

Id: [0x0023CAFE]
Were you able to protect her?

Id: [0x0023CB00]
That should be the last of them, <i>misthios</i>. You're quite the warrior.

Id: [0x0023CB04]
Has he been... dealt with, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CB06]
Has she been... taken care of, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CB0A]
Back already. Did you destroy them all?

Id: [0x0023CB0C]
You again. Has it been destroyed, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CB0F]
Did you get it?

Id: [0x0023CB17]
Have you done what I asked?

Id: [0x0023CB19]
Tell me it's been handled, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023CB1B]
I trust you were successful?

Id: [0x0023CB1D]
Do you bring me good news, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CB1F]
You're back. Finished already?

Id: [0x0023CB38]
Tell your friends, tell your family! The best wares drachmae can buy! Even mercenaries like <i>you</i> can find something.

Id: [0x0023CB39]
Odessa sent me.

Id: [0x0023CB3A]
Ah, of course! Sweet girl. Wish she had stopped by herself. This is for her father, I imagine.

Id: [0x0023CB3C]
I'll take the payment, and you can be on your way.

Id: [0x0023CB43]
Here, take it.

Id: [0x0023CB47]
I'm not paying for that. Unless you want Odessa's father to die, you'll give it to me now.

Id: [0x0023CB48]
Don't try to guilt me into giving you something for free. For all I know, Odessa didn't actually send you.

Id: [0x0023CB4A]
Quick sales are my favorites. I hope this helps Odessa.

Id: [0x0023CB4C]
Hmm, doesn't seem like you have enough. Come back when you do.

Id: [0x0023CB52]
I'll take it from your dead body, then.

Id: [0x0023CB54]
I'll return when I have the drachmae.

Id: [0x0023CB5B]
Odessa told me she'd pay you later.

Id: [0x0023CB5C]
I don't give away items for free.

Id: [0x0023CB5D]
You wouldn't be. She said she'd even pay extra for your trouble.

Id: [0x0023CB5E]
OK, but only because it's her. Make sure she stops by soon.

Id: [0x0023CB7C]
Magistrate Xanthe told me that you've been having trouble with your farm.

Id: [0x0023CBA0]
While you were gone, I oversaw the capture of three thousand. Yet still my men suck their thumbs.

Id: [0x0023CBA8]
Have you checked on the helots? They're working the blighted fields right now.

Id: [0x0023CBB0]
My men have been trained for war, <i>misthios</i>. Not skirmishes with bandits and chasing spies through the hills.

Id: [0x0023CBB1]
This is just a different kind of war, commander.

Id: [0x0023CBB2]
One we're not equipped for. We're losing our armor just trying to give chase!

Id: [0x0023CBBF]
There's a letter on him. "Dear cousin, I need your help evicting these bandits. Head west to my farm as soon as you can." Those could be the bandits I'm looking for.

Id: [0x0023CBDC]
I have... a delicate situation I need medical advice on. I've written it down here, but I can't be seen delivering the message.

Id: [0x0023CBDF]
What did you have in mind?

Id: [0x0023CBE0]
A crooked merchant stole several of my maps!

Id: [0x0023CBE4]
Crop failure. It's as if Eris herself salted the earth.

Id: [0x0023CBE5]
How are the crops failing?

Id: [0x0023CBE6]
Blight! Few plants grow, and the ones that do are wilted and covered in spots. The gods would never let this happen if they were happy. It's my godless helots, I tell you.

Id: [0x0023CBF0]
There's a place I've found in the southern hills with a wonderful view... Will you go there with me?

Id: [0x0023CBF1]
I like the view already. But let's go.

Id: [0x0023CBFC]
Maybe another time, Xenia.

Id: [0x0023CC01]
Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x0023CC02]
The cozener Autolykos is a swindler and a cheat. He robbed me of some of Anaximander's best work! I'm sure he's planning to find my treasures and sell them for a fortune.

Id: [0x0023CC03]
OK, OK! I'll try to find him before he can do that.

Id: [0x0023CC04]
He ruts about Nauplia. Check there.

Id: [0x0023CC05]
I'll see what I can uncover.

Id: [0x0023CC07]
What makes you blame your helots for the blight? Have they tampered with the plants and animals?

Id: [0x0023CC08]
What else dictates our fates? [&ah]Teuta won't stop babbling about the soil. Thinks I overwork my farm. Idiot woman. As if this farm hasn't been in my family for generations.

Id: [0x0023CC0B]
Have you found that pig of a merchant, Autolykos? He fattens his ass with meat and wine in Nauplia and plots to steal what's rightfully mine!

Id: [0x0023CC0E]
My favorite little weapon returns. How about tracking down the snivelling merchant who stole from me?

Id: [0x0023CC12]
The tide has brought my favorite little weapon back. What do you have for me?

Id: [0x0023CC17]
I'll find out what's happening.

Id: [0x0023CC18]
I don't have time right now.

Id: [0x0023CC1B]
The diseased crops have been burned and the river is cleared. That should be the last of the blight.

Id: [0x0023CC1C]
Oh! You truly are gods-sent. What was the cause of the rot?

Id: [0x0023CC20]
You were so busy looking to the sky that you ignored what was in front of you! The gods are not responsible for cleaning the fields or the river. That's on you!

Id: [0x0023CC22]
I can see why your helots would anger Demeter.

Id: [0x0023CC25]
Are you ready to find the whole truth of what's going on?

Id: [0x0023CC26]
I'll go talk to your helots and see what they know.

Id: [0x0023CC2D]
I haven't seen other farms in the area with blighted crops. What could be causing the difference?

Id: [0x0023CC2E]
The grain grew in short and dry, then the animals started to grow ill. Obvious signs of displeasing Persephone or her mother.

Id: [0x0023CC33]
Ugh, I hate living here. No villager's going to be intimidated by a dripping wet bandit. Bet we couldn't even scare a lone child.

Id: [0x0023CC34]
They should be intimidated by your blade, not by the state of your clothes.

Id: [0x0023CC36]
You know how much work I had to do? For a couple of ordinary musical instruments? I could have just gone to the market...

Id: [0x0023CC37]
These are not common instruments. These are fine works of art!

Id: [0x0023CC38]
Then you should pay me double.

Id: [0x0023CC39]
Double?! Maláka... [&laughs]I like the way you think. Done!

Id: [0x0023CC3B]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0023CC44]
I can match my bounty and then some, I'm sure.

Id: [0x0023CC46]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x0023CC48]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0023CC51]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0023CC53]
The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0023CC55]
So be it.

Id: [0x0023CC5B]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0023CC5D]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023CC63]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0023CC65]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0023CC67]
I found both treasures! Beautiful works, I'm sure the music they make will be... divine.

Id: [0x0023CC68]
Gratitude. Glad they were still there for you to get.

Id: [0x0023CC69]
Do you play?

Id: [0x0023CC6A]
Sadly not. Still, they'll look good in my chambers. Here, for your trouble.

Id: [0x0023CC6F]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0023CC72]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0023CCA0]
You're back. Have you killed them?

Id: [0x0023CCA2]
You again. Have you killed him?

Id: [0x0023CCA4]
You. Have you killed her?

Id: [0x0023CCA6]
<i>Misthios</i>! Has the beast been slain?

Id: [0x0023CCAA]
Were you able to free him?

<i>Misthios</i>! Were you able to keep him safe?

Id: [0x0023CEF9]
Were you able to protect her?

Id: [0x0023CEFB]
That should be the last of them, <i>misthios</i>. You're quite the warrior.

Id: [0x0023CEFF]
Has he been... dealt with, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CF01]
Has she been... taken care of, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CF05]
Back already. Did you destroy them all?

Id: [0x0023CF07]
You again. Has it been destroyed, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CF0A]
Did you get it?

Id: [0x0023CF12]
Have you done what I asked?

Id: [0x0023CF14]
Tell me it's been handled, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023CF16]
I trust you were successful?

Id: [0x0023CF18]
Do you bring me good news, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023CF1A]
You're back. Finished already?

Id: [0x0023CF20]
I've come to talk to you, little man.

Id: [0x0023CF24]
Eh? Who are you? You know what, I don't care. I don't like your look.

Id: [0x0023CF25]
What's wrong with my look?

Id: [0x0023CF27]
You smell like you don't have any money.

Id: [0x0023CF32]
Do you not like the way I look, or the way I smell? Xenia sent me... but I'm tougher than her crew.

Id: [0x0023CF33]
Xenia? Uh, she remembers me?

Id: [0x0023CF34]
Oh yes, and she's not happy. Return the maps you stole, and I won't have to hurt you.

Id: [0x0023CF35]
Stole?! Is that what she told you? She lost them to me in a bet! You tell her not cast dice and cry over the results.

Id: [0x0023CF38]
Do you smell the infernal winds of Erebos? Because I will fall upon you like one of the Furies.

Id: [0x0023CF39]
Who are you? What have I done?

Id: [0x0023CF3A]
Return the maps you stole from Xenia, or I'll destroy you like your wares!

Id: [0x0023CF3B]
You wouldn't dare.

Id: [0x0023CF42]
I don't care if she lost a bet or dropped them while drunk. She wants her maps, and you're going to give them to me. Now.

Id: [0x0023CF44]
Stuff it in your ass, <i>maláka</i>.

Id: [0x0023CF45]
Have it your way.

Id: [0x0023CF46]
You cheated at dice and tricked her into losing. Admit it, or I break something... starting with your hands!

Id: [0x0023CF48]
How did you know?

Id: [0x0023CF49]
I could smell it.

Id: [0x0023CF4C]
The maps are at my residence, near the Nauplia Shipshed.

Id: [0x0023CF4D]
You better not even think of lying.

Id: [0x0023CF4E]
I'm not, I'm not! I know if I did, you'd just come back to hound me.

Id: [0x0023CF4F]
You. Got. That. Right.

Id: [0x0023CF53]
When their <i>mater</i> and <i>pater</i> woke up to feed the animals, they discovered the animals were already feeding [beat]on the corpses of their sons.

Id: [0x0023CF58]
Quickly! Take this blade back to Agapios, and let's end this. The days of being pressed under The Dagger's thumb will soon be over.

Id: [0x0023CF5D]
When The Dagger is finally gone, Eretria will flourish again.

Id: [0x0023CF5E]
Tell me why!

Id: [0x0023CF74]
Interest? No, I have no -

Id: [0x0023CF76]
Don't lie to me!

Id: [0x0023CF77]
If The Dagger hijacked them? Never.

Id: [0x0023CF87]
Ah, you're right. I-I guess I didn't want it to be true. He's not a boy anymore, I can see that.

Id: [0x0023CF88]
He may be grown, but he still needs help.

Id: [0x0023CF89]
There's only one way I know how.

Id: [0x0023CF8B]
Let me know if there is any change in his condition. I'll be at the ship making offerings to Asklepios.

Id: [0x0023CF93]
Give Barnabas some time.

Id: [0x0023CF94]
But our time may run out. I have more leads to follow up on, but with Neleus like this I can't leave his side. Maybe you could help me?

Id: [0x0023CF9B]
The mine[2166620]. If the slave's right, the vase should be here.

Id: [0x0023CFA9]
<i>Misthios</i>, I know you must've taken the vase from the bandits. But, that's not the point. I have a favor to ask of you.

Id: [0x0023CFB3]
Barnabas is like family to me. I want to do anything I can to help Neleus.

Id: [0x0023CFB4]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0023CFB5]
[beat]You know, it's not often a beautiful and capable <i>misthios</i> comes to this house.

Id: [0x0023CFB7]
What? You would demand drachmae from a child?

Id: [0x0023CFB8]
I don't discriminate.

Id: [0x0023CFB9]
<i>Misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023CFBA]
I'll prepare to be shortchanged.

Id: [0x0023CFBB]
Some people think that favor means free. I don't do free.

Id: [0x0023CFBC]
I don't have much, but you can have it all if you do this for me.

Id: [0x0023CFC3]
Unless I know what it is, I won't know if I can gift you with this favor.

Id: [0x0023CFC4]
You're willing to hear me out. That's a start.

Id: [0x0023CFC7]
What kind of favor are we talking about?

Id: [0x0023CFC8]
My master recently told me that after the coming summer solstice he will release me. But I don't want to go. I want you to say that <i>I</i> told the bandits where to find the vase. And then, for atonement, I'll offer my services.

Id: [0x0023CFD8]
Well? Who took my vase?

Id: [0x0023CFDC]
Information!

Id: [0x0023CFDD]
They may have brought Neleus sickness, but the Fates <i>have</i> brought us together...

Id: [0x0023CFDE]
I'd hate to get sick someday and think of all the fun I didn't have.

Id: [0x0023CFDF]
But first, there are those leads you mentioned.

Id: [0x0023CFE3]
I guess we can work something out.

Id: [0x0023CFE5]
You're nicer than you look. Thank you!

Id: [0x0023CFEB]
I don't have time to find your brother.

Id: [0x0023CFEC]
Fine, I'll find someone who cares.

Id: [0x0023CFED]
Well, someone at the Champion's Gymnasium must know something.

Id: [0x0023CFEF]
Aietes was the last one to be with Neleus when he was well.

Id: [0x0023CFF0]
They were friends?

Id: [0x0023CFF1]
They were. If he doesn't know anything, you could talk to the doctor at the quarry[2408858].

Id: [0x0023CFF6]
You're not my student. Get out of my school!

Id: [0x0023D001]
Did you decide to help a worried sister save her brother?

Id: [0x0023D013]
Easy? Let's see if you can handle this!

Id: [0x0023D02C]
Here. This should help get you started.

Id: [0x0023D02E]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023D031]
I've already played my part - you're free now. The triumphs and struggles of that are yours and yours alone.

Id: [0x0023D032]
You're right. Having my freedom is all I need.

Id: [0x0023D034]
I'll never forget what you've given me - freedom.

Id: [0x0023D036]
Your brother must have been gone for a long time.

Id: [0x0023D03D]
What more can you tell me about this gymnasium[2400848]? You say other athletes have disappeared?

Id: [0x0023D03E]
Many, yes. A lot of the athletes came here to train from elsewhere across the Greek world, so when they disappear, people think they maybe just went home.

Id: [0x0023D043]
Where did you say you hid the maps?

Id: [0x0023D044]
I told you! They are in my residence, by the shipshed[2368576]!

Id: [0x0023D04C]
Aha! Perfect. With these, I can track down the treasures Xenia wants.

Id: [0x0023D053]
The Aliki Quarry is at the southern point of Thasos. The doctor there is mixed up with training athletes and the workers.

Id: [0x0023D055]
Ha! I knew from first sight that you couldn't be the champion. You don't have the stature.

Id: [0x0023D056]
Sounds like a strange connection.

Id: [0x0023D057]
Yes, until you realize half of the workers are athletes who have given up on their training. Something's happened to them, and that doctor is the only connection I see.

Id: [0x0023D05B]
West Wind, you are back. I feel like you owe me for enriching you so much.

Id: [0x0023D05C]
That's an interesting way to look at it.

Id: [0x0023D05D]
Help me recover my lost cargo and my missing crew. I need you to do this.

Id: [0x0023D066]
I'm at your call.

Id: [0x0023D067]
Gratitude.

Id: [0x0023D069]
I can't, Xenia. I have too much in my head just now.

Id: [0x0023D091]
I advise you to not take me lightly.

Id: [0x0023D092]
Ho, is that so? What say you have a go at some of my best students, then?

Id: [0x0023D0A9]
The last person to see Neleus before he got sick was Aietes. Where can I find him?

Id: [0x0023D0AA]
He's an aspiring athlete, too, but nowhere near as talented as Neleus. He trains alone on the outskirts of the Vineyard of Glory. You're sure to find him there.

Id: [0x0023D0AD]
A true champion has to eat the Champion's Feast before a match.

Id: [0x0023D0B1]
The bandits are in the northern hills of Mount Ochi.

Id: [0x0023D0B3]
I've never heard of it. What is it?

Id: [0x0023D0B4]
Swallowing a dozen bowls of sheep and buffalo <i>delicates</i>. It gives you unimaginable stamina, and the strength of Herakles.

Id: [0x0023D0C0]
Lies! Don't listen to this liar!

Id: [0x0023D0C1]
You can't prove it's a lie.

Id: [0x0023D0C2]
Yes I can, because I've tried it. The only thing it gives you is an upset stomach! You are no champion. Prepare for the taste of defeat!

Id: [0x0023D0C5]
Hmph. Doesn't sound impressive to me.

Id: [0x0023D0C6]
You have me wrong. I'm just a passing <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023D0C8]
If he's the local doctor, he's bound to know something.

Id: [0x0023D0C9]
Let's see what your students are made of.

Id: [0x0023D0CA]
Be careful, I heard the healers have their hands full these days.

Id: [0x0023D0CB]
I'm sure they will find time to tend to injured youth.

Id: [0x0023D0CE]
I have other priorities for now.

Id: [0x0023D0D0]
I'll follow up on these leads and check back when I know what's going on.

Id: [0x0023D0D1]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. And feel free to "check back" any time.

Id: [0x0023D0D2]
You're back! Have you decided to help us?

Id: [0x0023D0D3]
I'll see what I can find out.

Id: [0x0023D0D5]
Anyway, he was last seen training at this school[2400848]. I'm sure it has something to do with his disappearance!

Id: [0x0023D0DB]
Don't thank me just yet - my help doesn't come cheap.

Id: [0x0023D12A]
I don't have much, but I'll repay you with whatever I have.

Id: [0x0023D164]
Have you found out what happened to my brother yet?

Id: [0x0023D165]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0023D16E]
But <i>your</i> journey has exposed mysteries which have left me with no answers. Perhaps you will discover something I have not.

Id: [0x0023D204]
Bring me their Athenian seals as proof. You'll be rewarded for your efforts.

Who attacked you, and why?

Id: [0x0023D30B]
Soldiers of one faction or another. They are all the same to me.

Id: [0x0023D313]
Well, what do you need?

Id: [0x0023D316]
What did your crew lose that was so dear?

Id: [0x0023D317]
The exact what and why are not important. Only understand that the coffer carries something I value greatly. Bring it back, and I'll reward you well.

Id: [0x0023D321]
I had a letter from a soldier I... tended to after the battle. It is a matter I'd like to keep private.

Id: [0x0023D322]
Why tell me, then?

Id: [0x0023D323]
I have reasons to suspect a spy is targeting this camp. Documents of mine are missing, including the letter.

Id: [0x0023D32D]
What happened to the rest of the crew?

Id: [0x0023D32E]
Rest, Galateia. Among the missing are my master of maps, Anaximander, keen-eyed Iaira, and Galateia's brother, Kittos. They are all terribly loyal. It would be a shame to lose them.

Id: [0x0023D330]
Leave it to me. I'll find your crew and your precious cargo.

[&cry]She added a lock of my hair to the potion and then made me drink it. I didn't feel anything strange at the time, but when I did... All my hair... it just began to fall off.

Id: [0x0023D366]
What trickery is this?! You used her hair in a spell -

Id: [0x0023D4EE]
With our leader dead, we're in disarray. No commands, no reinforcements, no supplies. We've scrounged what we can, but men are abandoning the fort.

Id: [0x0023D4EF]
They're deserting?

Id: [0x0023D4F0]
Or worse, they're turning bandit and living like thieves instead of the soldiers they were born to be. A shame upon Sparta!

Id: [0x0023D4FC]
The village herbalist promised to create a poultice to aid our wounded, but she needs more supplies.

Id: [0x0023D4FD]
That seems simple enough.

Id: [0x0023D4FE]
I have what she needs here. But, I can't leave the wounded alone – there are thieves around every corner.

Id: [0x0023D507]
I'm sure they will.

Id: [0x0023D515]
A group of local outlaws has been causing trouble. Their leader dares defy Spartan rule!

Id: [0x0023D516]
That's hardly suprising.

Id: [0x0023D517]
It is time those <i>malákes</i> learned what happens to those who disrespect Sparta!

Id: [0x0023D525]
You've proved your worth as a Spartan. [&groan]You hit hard. Something upstream is making the water taste like a rusty blade.

Id: [0x0023D52C]
So I've been a diversion.

Id: [0x0023D52D]
Soon I'll know their sea routes.

Id: [0x0023D52F]
Why did you steal the tablet?

Id: [0x0023D530]
Because I could sell it. The Athenians would pay good drachmae for this!

Id: [0x0023D532]
A spy has been spotted near our camp. He must be reporting to Athenian soldiers!

Id: [0x0023D539]
I already told you everything I know. Go bother someone else!

Id: [0x0023D543]
I think I'm beginning to understand you, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0023D544]
Are you? Tell me, who do you think I am?

Id: [0x0023D545]
Those cursed Athenians could really use a hit to their weapons. [beat]And their numbers!

Id: [0x0023D54E]
You may be right. But really, why did you bring me out here?

Id: [0x0023D558]
Ah! Here you are, and not a moment too soon.

Id: [0x0023D562]
There have been reports of strange activity in these woods. Rumor has it that Athenian spies are hiding in the wilderness.

Id: [0x0023D568]
Go and see instead of listening to rumors.

Id: [0x0023D56A]
The trees provide good cover.

Id: [0x0023D56C]
If it weren't for all the bears and wolves plaguing our camp, I'd have rid these woods of spies a long time ago.

Id: [0x0023D571]
The Cyclops is more important than a bowyer. We need to talk.

Id: [0x0023D572]
Precisely what I was thinking! Let's hope Drucilla has a good sense of humor.

Id: [0x0023D573]
Well? Your plan?

Id: [0x0023D574]
I've dealt with the bandits and gotten the wood for the bowyer.

Id: [0x0023D575]
I had every confidence in you, my friend.

Id: [0x0023D57D]
Tilling isn't going to go any faster without a new hoe.

Id: [0x0023D583]
I heard that the crops haven't been producing this season.

Id: [0x0023D5C4]
What do you have to share with me, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023D5C8]
Makarios is well placed at the <i>agoge. </i>The trainer, Iatrokles, will be a hard taskmaster, but he will grow strong and brave.

Id: [0x0023D5C9]
You demonstrate the wisdom of Athena, Eagle Bearer. You are a blessing to this family.

Id: [0x0023D5D6]
Magistrate Xanthe, I have black news for you. Your older son is lost.

Id: [0x0023D5D7]
Dead?

Id: [0x0023D5D9]
My brother is in the next camp. Or he was... I don't know. I haven't seen him since that camp was attacked by raiders.

Id: [0x0023D5DA]
Spartans are tough. I'm sure he's fine.

Id: [0x0023D5DB]
No soldiers have made contact from that camp since it was attacked. But scouts have reported that the raiders may have taken prisoners.

Id: [0x0023D602]
There are several in the region who could benefit from your presence, Eagle Bearer. Help them. Inspire them. And I'll reward you.

Id: [0x0023D603]
Give me their names.

Id: [0x0023D604]
The farm owner, Lanike, as well as several of the town's important women - Zita, Damia, and Zeuxo.

Id: [0x0023D617]
Have you had a chance to speak to all of those noble Spartan women yet, to see what you can offer them?

Id: [0x0023D618]
Some of our ships went down before they could make it to shore - a chest of useful weapons gone to waste.

Id: [0x0023D619]
So why haven't you retrieved them?

Id: [0x0023D61A]
The waters are treacherous, <i>misthios. </i>Filled with sharks.

Id: [0x0023D61C]
I'll need those herbs before I can get anything else done.

Id: [0x0023D62D]
Always.

Id: [0x0023D62E]
I hope so. You accused me of being the problem. How do I know you haven't already made up your mind?

Id: [0x0023D62F]
I knew you would. You already believe they're after me, and you're right. I want to have proof in my hand saying why.

Id: [0x0023D630]
The truth always comes out.

Id: [0x0023D631]
It will. [beat]And then I can finally follow in the footsteps of Odysseus.

Id: [0x0023D632]
Lanike expects more crops every year. The soil needs to rest.

Id: [0x0023D633]
So, there could be nothing else causing crop shortage?

Id: [0x0023D634]
I didn't say that.

Id: [0x0023D635]
From slave to general, bathing in the blood of this war, while our leaders stuff their faces and preen.

Id: [0x0023D637]
I will end this war in <i>my</i> favor.

Id: [0x0023D638]
You have a strategy?

Id: [0x0023D63A]
I asked you a question, helot. I don't have all day.

Id: [0x0023D63B]
So long as your search for glory never ends, your name will be remembered.

Id: [0x0023D63C]
Perhaps they'll sing your name as well in the songs they write about me.

Id: [0x0023D63D]
Give up that dream.

Id: [0x0023D63E]
If I listened to everyone who told me to stop, I would have achieved nothing. I'll show you.

Id: [0x0023D63F]
If you want to find the truth, we need a clue.

Id: [0x0023D640]
What about the note you found... from the leader of Megaris? He's planning something.

Id: [0x0023D643]
You go.

Id: [0x0023D644]
I'll find the proof you need.

Id: [0x0023D645]
Good. I want this whole thing to be over.

Id: [0x0023D649]
A long voyage can be relaxing, but we are not really the cruising type. If you want to spice things up a bit, you can always check my log over there.

Id: [0x0023D64A]
I make a note of anything I hear that could be of interest... to a daring captain.

Id: [0x0023D64D]
You are the Eagle Bearer. Wonderful! Magistrate Xanthe has spoken highly of you.

Id: [0x0023D64E]
Very kind of her.

Id: [0x0023D64F]
So, here's the thing. My children have promising futures. But they refuse to learn and study. They think they know better, but they can't recite a poem to save their lives.

Id: [0x0023D653]
Shit. I should take care of that.

Id: [0x0023D66E]
Where's a misthios when you need one?

Id: [0x0023D66F]
My beloved silos! My darlings!

Id: [0x0023D673]
I'm going to teach you to respect your elders, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x0023D676]
Hmm... engage <i>us</i>?

Id: [0x0023D679]
We'll settle this! See that you're on the battlefield, or I will hunt you down myself.

Id: [0x0023D67B]
You know more than you're saying.

Id: [0x0023D67C]
My stomach aches, and it's hard to concentrate. It's a shame that there's no mint around to chew.

Id: [0x0023D67F]
I did your dirty deeds. And look at the position you hold now.

Id: [0x0023D681]
The hills would make a good spot for our camp... but raiders have been pillaging the area.

Id: [0x0023D682]
You look like you could handle that.

Id: [0x0023D683]
Of course. But wild beasts roam these hills as well, and I don't have the time to go hunting.

Id: [0x0023D685]
I'll go find some mint for you.

Id: [0x0023D697]
You're back. Have you killed them?

Id: [0x0023D699]
You again. Have you killed him?

Id: [0x0023D69B]
You. Have you killed her?

Id: [0x0023D69D]
<i>Misthios</i>! Has the beast been slain?

Id: [0x0023D6A2]
Were you able to free him?

Id: [0x0023D6A4]
You're back. Were you able to free her?

Id: [0x0023D6AD]
<i>Misthios</i>! Were you able to keep him safe?

Id: [0x0023D6AF]
Were you able to protect her?

Id: [0x0023D6B1]
That should be the last of them, <i>misthios</i>. You're quite the warrior.

Id: [0x0023D6B6]
Has he been... dealt with, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023D6B8]
Has she been... taken care of, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023D6BD]
Back already. Did you destroy them all?

Id: [0x0023D6BF]
You again. Has it been destroyed, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023D6C3]
Did you get it?

Id: [0x0023D6CC]
Have you done what I asked?

Id: [0x0023D6CE]
Tell me it's been handled, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023D6D0]
I trust you were successful?

Id: [0x0023D6D2]
Do you bring me good news, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023D6D4]
You're back. Finished already?

Id: [0x0023D6DE]
The cowards who fled our battlefield and abandoned their brothers deserve to die.

Id: [0x0023D6DF]
Are you planning to go after them?

Id: [0x0023D6E0]
I wish I could, but I need to stay and prepare for another attack. The crate of supplies they made off with would have been useful, though.

Id: [0x0023D6EA]
Our spies say the Athenians are worried their food will run out. They are guarding what's left carefully.

Id: [0x0023D6EB]
I'm not surprised. Rations are hard to come by out here.

Id: [0x0023D6EC]
Without food, they will be too weak to fight us. But they won't give up their supplies easily.

Id: [0x0023D6F1]
And what did the <i>misthios</i> find?

Id: [0x0023D6F2]
A body... a woman. She was killed by an Athenian spear.

Id: [0x0023D6F3]
This is all?

Id: [0x0023D6F5]
There was a letter from Podarkes - said he'd kill them both if she broke her silence. Both. Why kill a child? Unless…[&gasp] it was his.

Id: [0x0023D6F6]
Shh! They could be listening. Now, tell me, quietly, what else did you find?

Id: [0x0023D6F7]
The dolls. Engraved with the letters "K" and "M." [beat]"M" is for <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x0023D6F9]
You asked who I worked for. The little doll with the "K"...

Id: [0x0023D6FB]
Yes, yes. Which means...

Id: [0x0023D720]
I've been through three already.

Id: [0x0023D724]
He used to boast about future Olympic victories and adventures. He always said he'd make me the proudest sister in all the Greek world...

Id: [0x0023D725]
I'll find out what happened to your brother.

Id: [0x0023D726]
Please hurry. It's been too quiet around here without him.

Id: [0x0023D72C]
I don't look for fights, they usually find me.

Id: [0x0023D730]
See, friend? If you don't pay your taxes, you end up a slave.

Id: [0x0023D731]
I paid them! Again and again, I've paid every tax you ever invented! Please, I haven't got anything left...

Id: [0x0023D732]
I've seen your farm[2400032], friend. Don't tell me you're broke.

Id: [0x0023D737]
Why are there so many young athletes training at this school[2400848]?

Id: [0x0023D738]
You've never heard of this place? This school[2400848] is what Thasos[2400846] is known for!

Id: [0x0023D746]
You mentioned something called "The Dagger?"

Id: [0x0023D751]
An unusual blade. This must be what The Dagger's after.

Id: [0x0023D753]
All right, all right. I yield!

Id: [0x0023D759]
We've nothing to learn from a fallen master.

Id: [0x0023D75D]
Where do I fit into this?

Id: [0x0023D75E]
They've heard of the Eagle Bearer and worship the ground you walk on. If you related an epic story to them, I'd bet they'd retain it and impress their tutors.

Id: [0x0023D772]
It's an odd request, but I've been asked to do stranger things. I'll do it.

Id: [0x0023D777]
You've ruined my reputation. How will my students learn from me now?

Id: [0x0023D778]
You were ruined by pride. I had no part in it.

Id: [0x0023D779]
Will you help me now, and tell my children an inspiring tale to set their imaginations and memories alight?

Id: [0x0023D77B]
I'm not the one you want. Everyone who has ever heard a poem thinks they are a natural born storyteller, but it takes a talent I'm not sure I possess.

Id: [0x0023D77E]
Fine! You've won. You <i>are</i> worthy. I'll tell you what I know.

Id: [0x0023D77F]
Keeping a school like this is expensive. But, we receive a good lump of drachmae from this rich fellow to keep things running. He visits now and then, stinking of wine, frequently accompanied by strange men.

Id: [0x0023D782]
You're back! Neleus hasn't gotten any better.

Id: [0x0023D783]
But maybe you're here to see me instead?

Id: [0x0023D784]
My children are waiting inside the Temple of Dionysos Kolonatas for today's epic story. The subject is Perseus, which they should know well, but seem to forget all when questioned.

Id: [0x0023D78D]
Go on, Eagler Bearer, my children wait inside the Temple of Dionysos Kolonatas for your recital of the Perseus story. If you need a refresher, the adjacent hall holds many wonderful relics relating to the tale.

Id: [0x0023D78F]
I assume they're not here to admire the training grounds?

Id: [0x0023D790]
I notice that they tend to favor my star athletes, the ones who exhibit exemplary skills and performance. They watch them very closely.

Id: [0x0023D7A4]
I know the story well, of course, but my preferred version may not be what your children expect...

Id: [0x0023D7A5]
Do not fear! If you need a reminder, there are many relics related to Perseus in the hall adjacent to the Temple of Dionysos Kolonatas.

Id: [0x0023D7A6]
Good to know.

Id: [0x0023D7AA]
I could hear the children laughing and cheering from here. You obviously did a terrific job. Thank you!

Id: [0x0023D7AD]
Couldn't hold their attention, huh? Well, at least you tried. Even if they did boo and jeer. [beat]I guess you didn't have a very good childhood, huh?

Id: [0x0023D7AF]
I heard everything! How can you stand by while your students are being taken? All for drachmae?!

Id: [0x0023D7B0]
How did you get in here?

Id: [0x0023D7B8]
Perseus? I know his story well, as if we were cousins both raised at the base of Mount Olympos. Do not fear, I will hold your children fast with my tale.

Id: [0x0023D7BD]
I've been thinking about you and wanted to see you again. I won't pretend otherwise.

Id: [0x0023D7BE]
You've stormed into my life like a creature from the summit of Olympus itself. It's safe to say I've been thinking about you, too.

Id: [0x0023D7C4]
No more cowering. I'm the master of this school. I need to act like one.

Id: [0x0023D7CD]
I thought a <i>misthios</i> would know? They're tiny blades that look like baby swords.

Id: [0x0023D7E1]
I don't see my husband. Is he not with you? Is he not coming home? Did you find him with some filthy hetaera?!

Id: [0x0023D7E3]
We should probably leave our feelings aside... for now.

Id: [0x0023D7E4]
For the sake of Neleus.

Id: [0x0023D7E5]
Yes.

Id: [0x0023D7E6]
Is there anything I can do to help?

Id: [0x0023D7E9]
Champion of the battle of One Hundred Hands.

Id: [0x0023D7EA]
Tell me... Is any of it true?

Id: [0x0023D7EC]
My husband still isn't home. If the Dagger's behind this, then he might already be...[as if to say "dead", but instead trails off]. Please, will you help find him?

Id: [0x0023D7EF]
Solon was one of them.

Id: [0x0023D7F0]
Yes... He was one of my top students, along with another boy named Neleus. They were good friends and great athletes.

Id: [0x0023D7F6]
Solon... He was one of my greatest athletes. He stopped coming to class soon after the men came.

Id: [0x0023D7FC]
You told a terrific story, Eagle Bearer!

Id: [0x0023D7FD]
It was... GREAT!

Id: [0x0023D801]
I really don't remember the story like that. I think you made it up.

Id: [0x0023D802]
You're terrible! You don't know anything about stories! It was bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

Id: [0x0023D80D]
Hello, I'm -

Id: [0x0023D810]
The Eagle Bearer! We've heard all about you!

Id: [0x0023D811]
Are you going to tell us a story today? Do we have to listen? We've heard it a hundred times.

Id: [0x0023D812]
Yes, that's me. And yes, I'm telling you a story.

Id: [0x0023D81D]
Some of us want to follow in your footsteps, <i>misthios</i>. Can we come with you?

Id: [0x0023D81F]
Not bad. Even the best of my students cannot stand against you.

Id: [0x0023D820]
Warm up is over.

Id: [0x0023D821]
Such fire! Come then, if you dare. Face me like a real warrior in our arena!

Id: [0x0023D826]
I'll see you all at the selection ceremony, ladies!

Id: [0x0023D82A]
Try sparring with my students first. We'll see if you are as strong as you say you are.

Id: [0x0023D82C]
I especially hope -

Id: [0x0023D82E]
<i>You</i> show up.

Id: [0x0023D82F]
I'm sorry, my love. Give me a moment, some peasants need my attention.

Id: [0x0023D830]
Sounds interesting.

Id: [0x0023D831]
Good. Take my boat and head up the Pephka coast towards the shipwreck and into the mouth of the valley. There you'll find the entrance to my arena[2400534] and Skoura, who handles my fighters.

Id: [0x0023D832]
I don't need your arena to prove myself.

Id: [0x0023D837]
That's too bad. You'd have been so... <i>appreciated</i>.

Id: [0x0023D838]
You should continue your training here.

Id: [0x0023D83B]
I could use a few good warriors.

Id: [0x0023D83C]
You hear that? We're going to be warriors!

Id: [0x0023D83F]
You must be the one training these athletes.

Id: [0x0023D841]
Qualified?

Id: [0x0023D842]
You dare challenge my position? You have the courage of a lion, <i>misthios</i>, but you'll soon be slaughtered like a goat. Prepare yourself and face me like the champion you say you are!

Id: [0x0023D843]
Arrangements can always be made with drachmae.

Id: [0x0023D846]
Donations to the school are always welcome. Your help in the upkeep is appreciated.

Id: [0x0023D847]
Now, I hope the healers find the time to tend to you after we're done.

Id: [0x0023D848]
I'll be fine. The same cannot be said for you, however.

Id: [0x0023D84A]
We can't do this now.

Id: [0x0023D84B]
[&breath]I know, I know. It's just -

Id: [0x0023D84D]
What's happened to Neleus is still an open question. I need to get to work.

Id: [0x0023D84E]
What do you need, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023D84F]
There's nowhere for me to go. I only have the clothes on my back.

Id: [0x0023D9AC]
I have some questions.

Id: [0x0023D9D7]
Shh... [beat]Do you hear that?

Id: [0x0023D9E2]
I hear nothing but the ramblings of a sad old man.

Id: [0x0023D9E3]
Old?! Surely you can't tell my years from your ears alone.

Id: [0x0023D9E4]
I've used my eyes as well.

Id: [0x0023D9E6]
Yes... I hear it too... What do you think it could be?

Id: [0x0023D9E7]
I hear nothing but the wind.

Id: [0x0023D9E8]
Exactly. Nothing.

Id: [0x0023D9E9]
Right...

Id: [0x0023D9EE]
No, no, no, this can't - how is this <i>possible?!</i>

Id: [0x0023D9EF]
Master, it's a name. Written in the records over and over again. The name of the man leading The Dagger. The Kingfisher.

Id: [0x0023D9F0]
Once you know the Kingfisher's real name, bring him before a court of law. He and The Dagger have wounded Euboea - Euboea should have a chance to decide his fate.

Id: [0x0023D9F2]
Agapios, what's wrong? What have you found?

Id: [0x0023D9F3]
It's the sound of someone lying to me.

Id: [0x0023D9F4]
Or someone humoring a frail old man.

Id: [0x0023D9FA]
Sadly, it's more complicated than that.

Id: [0x0023D9FC]
<i>Misthios!</i> And that looks like Barnabas's ship.

Id: [0x0023D9FD]
In fact it -

Id: [0x0023D9FF]
Ah! That ship belongs to the Eagle Bearer now. Legendary <i>misthios</i>, famed across the Greek world. I'm just her humble servant.

Id: [0x0023DA00]
Barnabas! You're back!

Id: [0x0023DA02]
In the flesh. A little older, but not a bit wiser.

Id: [0x0023DA03]
Mikkos sent me here to wait for your return. It's about Neleus...

Id: [0x0023DA04]
Here we go. What has my nephew gotten himself into this time?

Id: [0x0023DA06]
I need to think. But one thing... I know my nephew. Ah yes. He's fine, that much is certain. I'll be on the ship.

Id: [0x0023DA0A]
Agapios, tell her.

Id: [0x0023DA0D]
What -

Id: [0x0023DA0E]
No, no. Please leave, we don't want any bother.

Id: [0x0023DA18]
Nothing is more important to Euboea's survival than stopping The Dagger. [beat]I'm sorry, old friend - the Kingfisher must be dealt with, whether he's your brother or not.

Id: [0x0023DA1C]
I - yes, master. I understand.

Id: [0x0023DA1F]
Typical <i>misthios</i> thinking. It's not that simple.

Id: [0x0023DA20]
An oddly democratic opinion for a <i>misthios</i>...

Id: [0x0023DA23]
I'll do more than bother if you don't answer my questions.

Id: [0x0023DA24]
OK, [beat]OK. What questions do you have?

Id: [0x0023DA26]
I don't want any trouble. I just want some answers.

Id: [0x0023DA27]
To what... questions?

Id: [0x0023DA29]
The Doctor is gone. He's been [beat]captered... catured...?

Id: [0x0023DA2A]
Captured?

Id: [0x0023DA35]
We told you, he's not here! Stop coming back! Don't make me punch you!

Id: [0x0023DA36]
You wouldn't punch a little girl!

Id: [0x0023DA3C]
Maion said to look for shipwrecks...

Id: [0x0023DA40]
Did something happen to you? Something that brought you to the quarry[2408858]?

Id: [0x0023DA42]
The shipwrecks should lead me to the arena[2400534].

Id: [0x0023DA4C]
What an entrance...

Id: [0x0023DA75]
Ladies and gentlemen! You came here to see the best fighters in the Greek world... And I'm giving you the best fighters in the Greek world!

Id: [0x0023DA7C]
You want the best?

Id: [0x0023DA7E]
I said, do you want the best?!

Id: [0x0023DA80]
Do. You. Want. The best?!

Id: [0x0023DA82]
Well, here they are!

Id: [0x0023DA85]
Tell me about the Doctor.

Id: [0x0023DA86]
He's a [beat]good man. He makes the medicine and cures us from our... sickness.

Id: [0x0023DA87]
You're cured -

Id: [0x0023DA88]
The Doctor says it [beat]takes time. Which is why we... need him back, soon.

Id: [0x0023DA8C]
For those of you about to <i>risk your lives</i>... The crowd salutes you!

Id: [0x0023DA92]
We have a winner!

Id: [0x0023DA99]
What a show everyone! What a <i>show!</i>

Id: [0x0023DA9F]
We're going to remember that one, aren't we?!

Id: [0x0023DAA6]
Gather round and listen, children, while I spin you the yarn of Perseus.

Id: [0x0023DAA8]
Let us sing with the voice of the goddess about the exploits of brave Perseus and noble Pegasos!

Id: [0x0023DAAA]
The blood of the enemy will show our leaders that my strategy is the right one.

Id: [0x0023DAAD]
Eh, that one?

Id: [0x0023DB39]
I saw deserters scurry past here into the wilderness. Cowards!

Id: [0x0023DB3A]
Can't you handle a few cowards?

Id: [0x0023DB3B]
I would tear them apart if I could, but I need to safeguard this village from the wild animals.

Id: [0x0023DB44]
Don't the stories of Odysseus mention how great of a lover he was?

Id: [0x0023DB45]
Do they? I must have missed those.

Id: [0x0023DB46]
We could read more about Odysseus... together.

Id: [0x0023DB47]
Is that your idea of fun?

Id: [0x0023DB48]
Reading can be sexy.

Id: [0x0023DB49]
You said you want to be like Odysseus. We could do better than that.

Id: [0x0023DB4C]
We will talk more about... <i>us</i> once this is all done. First, the note you found was from the leader of Megaris... There has to be proof of what he's up to.

Id: [0x0023DB4D]
I'll pay more than whatever fool sent you.

Id: [0x0023DB4F]
I can match your fee and more, <i>misthios</i>, if you just walk away now.

Id: [0x0023DB50]
Our rations are running low, but we must continue our war efforts in the area.

Id: [0x0023DB51]
Spoken like a true Spartan.

Id: [0x0023DB52]
And yet... It is disheartening the bandits around here are better fed than us. They must have a stockpile of food nearby.

Id: [0x0023DB55]
No need to spill any blood today, <i>misthios</i>. I'm more than willing to pay you to turn a blind eye.

Id: [0x0023DB5D]
You came for a fight. Let's get this over with.

Id: [0x0023DB5F]
Very well. I know when to accept my fate.

Id: [0x0023DB67]
Fine. Give it your best shot.

Id: [0x0023DB6F]
I’ll be commander soon. And then I’ll be crowned by the gods.

Id: [0x0023DB73]
I was thinking something more... short term. But if that's what it takes to avoid death, [beat]I'll join you.

Id: [0x0023DB75]
I never saw myself as a sailor, but [beat]life on the open sea is certainly preferable to death. I'm in.

Id: [0x0023DB7B]
Come now, <i>misthios</i>. Surely there's something I can do to change your mind?

Id: [0x0023DB7D]
No one has to die here. There must be something I can do to convince you to walk away.

Id: [0x0023DB83]
Desert my post to sail with a mercenary hired to kill me? On second thought, let's get this over with now.

Id: [0x0023DB85]
You're asking me to shirk my duty to do grunt work aboard your ship? Not a chance.

Id: [0x0023DB8C]
Do you have any idea what I'm looking for?

Id: [0x0023DB8D]
The leader is the most powerful man in Megaris - I can't accuse him of anything unless I have proof that he's after me.

Id: [0x0023DB8E]
Let's say I do find the truth you're looking for. What next?

Id: [0x0023DB8F]
Then I tell everyone who would listen. The leader wouldn't dare kill me or my father once everyone knows their plans.

Id: [0x0023DB90]
I'll be back with proof. Whatever it may be.

Id: [0x0023DB91]
I saw a deserter flee towards the port. He must think he can escape by boat!

Id: [0x0023DBA1]
Athenian ships are heading towards the port. It must be their reinforcements!

Id: [0x0023DBA2]
You have a tough fight ahead.

Id: [0x0023DBA3]
I can't abandon my post to deal with their fleet right now. Not when I've already got a camp of those <i>malákes</i> attacking us every chance they get.

Id: [0x0023DBA6]
You call that a fight? You've barely winded me. I just need... to sit down.

Id: [0x0023DBA7]
Tell me what you know.

Id: [0x0023DBA8]
When I was a girl, the farm I lived on suffered a blight. My master burned everything. The plants, the diseased animals.

Id: [0x0023DBCA]
Wild beasts seem to be drawn to this area. Bears, wolves, and even lions have been plaguing us. Something nearby must be enticing them.

Id: [0x0023DBCB]
What do you think it is?

Id: [0x0023DBCC]
Maybe bandits not properly storing their food, or [beat, hushed]there's talk of Followers making bloody sacrifices nearby.

Id: [0x0023DC1D]
The Athenians have found one of our spies. They won't give him up easily.

Id: [0x0023DC1E]
What will you do?

Id: [0x0023DC1F]
We can't approach their camp unnoticed. But a <i>misthios</i> should have no trouble.

Id: [0x0023DC2E]
The Cyclops said you like to act tough. So act tough!

Id: [0x0023DC2F]
You should know by now. The Cyclops always collects his debts.

Id: [0x0023DC64]
These seals should provide you ample proof.

Id: [0x0023DC65]
My command on the battlefield has been more than secured.

Id: [0x0023DC66]
You played both sides, and now there is only one choice to make. But know this... I see events play out so clearly that even the oracles envy me. Fight alongside me or not. Decide!

The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0023DE16]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0023DE17]
Hunt him down! Show him that no mercenary dog will interfere with Sparta's plans.

Id: [0x0023DE19]
Since you have such a high opinion of mercenaries, why even send me?

Id: [0x0023DE1A]
I'm sorry... It's just this man Hyrkanos is like a thorn in our foot. He's a menace to all Spartans here. [beat]Please, will you help us?

Id: [0x0023DE1C]
So be it.

Id: [0x0023DE25]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0023DE27]
The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0023DE29]
So be it.

Id: [0x0023DE30]
At this rate, the Spartans will need to recruit from their farmers.

Id: [0x0023DE31]
You're really not fond of Sparta.

Id: [0x0023DE35]
Your last attack against the Spartans didn't generate enough confusion. I need you to remove more of their commanders.

Id: [0x0023DE3A]
Have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x0023DE40]
I have other jobs.

Id: [0x0023DE42]
I'll get you your seals.

Id: [0x0023DE49]
I know enough to keep going.

Id: [0x0023DE4B]
Why do you think the Spartans are attacking Athens now?

Id: [0x0023DE4C]
Why do they do anything? For conquest. For glory. Because they know no other life than war.

Id: [0x0023DE4D]
What will you do with all these seals?

Id: [0x0023DE4E]
For now, I'll use them as proof of what I've achieved. It will give my words weight. Very few Athenians have ever seen a Spartan seal.

Id: [0x0023DE50]
Do you have my seals?

Id: [0x0023DE60]
I do.

Id: [0x0023DE61]
The Spartans must be aware of your actions by now. They can't be happy. Interested in upsetting them some more?

Id: [0x0023DE63]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0023DE64]
Return when you do.

Id: [0x0023DE68]
I can respect your determination.

Id: [0x0023DE6F]
More Spartan commanders? I thought you were supposed to be a brilliant tactician.

Id: [0x0023DE70]
I thought <i>you</i> were a professional.

Id: [0x0023DE7A]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0023DE7C]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023DE82]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0023DE84]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023DE88]
I'll do it. If he's this much trouble, I take it there's a sizeable reward?

Id: [0x0023DE89]
Of course! Just think of how much he'll have on him with all the drachmae Athens has given him to thwart our plans.

Id: [0x0023DE8C]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0023DE8E]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023DE94]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0023DE96]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0023DE99]
Unfortunately, I have other business right now.

Id: [0x0023DE9D]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0023DE9F]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0023DEA3]
Have you changed your mind? Will you track down and kill Hyrkanos for Sparta?

Id: [0x0023DEA6]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0023DEA8]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0023DEB0]
You've impressed me, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x0023DEB5]
You've done your part well enough.

Id: [0x0023DEBA]
Have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x0023DEC0]
I have other things I need to do. I'll come back when I have time.

Id: [0x0023DEC2]
The commanders will be taken care of.

Id: [0x0023DEC9]
I'll leave now.

Id: [0x0023DECB]
You seem to admire art and philosophy... But how can someone who truly values that go to war?

Id: [0x0023DECC]
If you have any care for knowledge or the arts, you must be ready to defend these rights. I am here to take up arms so that they can continue to enrich our culture.

Id: [0x0023DECD]
You expect total obedience from your soldiers, I suppose. So why do you fight for democracy?

Id: [0x0023DECE]
What is free will? It's essential that citizens play an active role in the function of their state.

Id: [0x0023DED0]
Do you have the seals for me?

Id: [0x0023DED5]
What was it you needed again?

Id: [0x0023DEE0]
Your army holds the garrisons.

Id: [0x0023DEE1]
Good. This is good. You do intrigue me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023DEE3]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0023DEE4]
I'm a busy man. We need those Spartan commanders removed from their posts. Go!

Id: [0x0023DEEF]
The seals are proof enough. Your troops occupy the garrisons now.

Id: [0x0023DEF9]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0023DEFB]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0023DF01]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0023DF04]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0023DF0B]
I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0023DF0E]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0023DF10]
Oh! Just what I needed. Take this for your trouble, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023DF12]
Perfect timing, <i>misthios</i>. Let me repay you.

Id: [0x0023DF14]
Ah, yes, I was wondering when this would arrive. Here, your payment.

Id: [0x0023DF16]
Ah, just what I needed. Take this as payment.

Id: [0x0023DF19]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! Here, this is for you.

Id: [0x0023DF20]
May the gods shield you!

Id: [0x0023DF23]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0023DF26]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0023DF28]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x0023DF2A]
I'd like to take you at your word, but... I'm sure you must have some evidence that they really are all dead.

Id: [0x0023DF2C]
Seems odd that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any proof he's free?

Id: [0x0023DF2E]
I really think I would have heard from her by now if she were free. Do you have any proof that you finished the job?

Id: [0x0023DF30]
I'd like to take you at your word that the beast has gone free, but... do you have any proof that the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023DF32]
Last I heard, he was still causing trouble. Do you have any proof that he's no longer a concern?

Id: [0x0023DF34]
She still seems to be an active concern from what I've heard. Do you have any proof that she's been dealt with?

Id: [0x0023DF36]
Until we know each other better... Do you have any proof it's been destroyed?

Id: [0x0023DF3E]
I'd like to believe you but... something's off. Do you have any proof they've been destroyed?

Id: [0x0023DF64]
It feels strange that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any evidence that he's no longer vulnerable?

Id: [0x0023DF66]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023DF7B]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0023DF7D]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0023DF7F]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x0023DF81]
I'd like to take you at your word, but... I'm sure you must have some evidence that they really are all dead.

Id: [0x0023DF83]

Id: [0x0023DF87]

Id: [0x0023DF91]

Id: [0x0023DF93]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023DF9A]
I suppose you're right... Any idea where to start looking?

Id: [0x0023DF9B]
He could be anywhere. Most likely, he's nestled up close to the Athenians. We've sent out a couple of patrols, but they never returned, and we can't spare any more men at this time.

Id: [0x0023DF9C]
Sometimes you're better sending a woman, anyway.

Id: [0x0023DFAC]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0023DFAE]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0023DFB0]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x0023DFC8]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023DFD4]
This must be Hyrkanos's camp...

Id: [0x0023DFE2]
You have a lesson to learn.

Id: [0x0023DFE7]
Never mess with the Cyclops!

Id: [0x0023DFF5]
Thank you, <i>misthios!</i>

Id: [0x0023DFF7]
The great god of the sea, Poseidon, visited a mortal woman, Sarra, a fisherman's daughter. The god of the sea frolicked with her, in the shape of a dolphin, and she knew his love.

Id: [0x0023DFF8]
I thought Perseus's mother's name was Danae, like my sister?

Id: [0x0023DFF9]
Yeah, and his father was Zeus!

Id: [0x0023DFFA]
Uh, well, that's true in some versions... Anyway, at some point baby Perseus fell off a boat and almost drowned.

Id: [0x0023E0B0]
The Mycenaeans? I don't see how they could know. It must be related to <i>Trophonios</i>. I'll observe them and see what I can learn.

Id: [0x0023E0B1]
Fine. I'll search further inside.

Id: [0x0023E0DF]
You wouldn't happen to be the Eagle Bearer, would you?

Id: [0x0023E0E0]
Me? Yes I am.

Id: [0x0023E0E1]
Words do you no justice. Your hair must have been woven by Athena, your body is like a sculpture made by the masters... Your arms look so strong. Strong enough to...

Id: [0x0023E110]
Please don't forget to bring Kalibos that basket I gave you!

Id: [0x0023E118]
This is more elaborate than I thought.

Id: [0x0023E11C]
I don't have time for that.

Id: [0x0023E15F]
Get your pots here! Good for the whole family!

Id: [0x0023E160]
It'll be easy to carry.

Id: [0x0023E161]
Thank you so much. Let me know if you need anything.

Id: [0x0023E166]
Hmm. This statue depicts a warrior.

Id: [0x0023E169]
Thank you for helping my Kalibos, Eagle Bearer. Is he all right?

Id: [0x0023E16A]
He lives.

Id: [0x0023E1B8]
We're in the right place. Unfortunately, my friend, it's been looted. All I found was this armor.

Id: [0x0023E1BC]
I'll help with your delivery.

Id: [0x0023E1BF]
Was the stele influencing them in some way?

Id: [0x0023E1CE]
We took the food, but we didn't kill anyone. Do we even look like we could?

Id: [0x0023E1E8]
Where might I find Kalibos?

Id: [0x0023E1E9]
He's an important general. His unit is stationed in the northeast, near the Fort of Praisai, down by the beach.

Id: [0x0023E1EF]
What's in the basket?

Id: [0x0023E1F0]
What any man would need on the eve of battle to win the respect of the gods. Please, Eagle Bearer, it would give him an edge over his enemies.

Id: [0x0023E27E]
A <i>misthios</i>? Well met. What brings you to our camp?

Id: [0x0023E27F]
You are Kalibos? Your wife sent me to deliver this package. I think it might be some kind of offering.

Id: [0x0023E286]
Kassandra! Over here.

Id: [0x0023E28F]
No... Not really.

Id: [0x0023E290]
We were just hungry that's all...

Id: [0x0023E2C8]
Zeuxo is a good woman. She's gifted me with a basket fit for Dionysos.

Id: [0x0023E2C9]
Earthly pleasures? She made it sound like it was a case of life and death.

Id: [0x0023E2CA]
A deathly hangover, maybe. Boys, we're having a good night! Care to join us, friend?

Id: [0x0023E2D3]
I have a job for you, if you'd care to act like a professional.

Id: [0x0023E301]
Yes, by a little stream northeast of Kirrha. The flowers haven't bloomed yet, but the leaves are a distinctive gray-green. Thank you.

Id: [0x0023E32D]
Sami. Duris will be at his shop.

Id: [0x0023E32F]
What is it?

Id: [0x0023E330]
I hope you want to help me.

Id: [0x0023E331]
Maybe naked.

Id: [0x0023E332]
That's a great plan.

Id: [0x0023E333]
You've returned. I hope with good news.

Id: [0x0023E334]
I'm not sure if it's good or not yet. There <i>were</i> two pieces of proof I found that they're after you.

Id: [0x0023E335]
Perfect! What were the reasons?

Id: [0x0023E336]
One was due to your family's wealth. The other had to do with an arranged marriage.

Id: [0x0023E337]
That's plenty of proof showing I'm the victim here!

Id: [0x0023E338]
I think I can spare a little bit of time.

Id: [0x0023E339]
I plan on taking a lot longer than that.

Id: [0x0023E33D]
I feel so relaxed. Now give me some good news so my mood can stay like this.

Id: [0x0023E33E]
I appreciate your help, but I'm not sure.

Id: [0x0023E33F]
I thought there was something between us.

Id: [0x0023E340]
At times it felt that way, but not enough for me. Let's keep our focus on what's important here.

Id: [0x0023E341]
Before we get serious, how about we finally have some fun?

Id: [0x0023E342]
You've hired other mercenaries?

Id: [0x0023E343]
Oh... Just for odd jobs here and there. There's always something to be done that could use one.

Id: [0x0023E344]
A man you were meant to marry was killed suddenly.

Id: [0x0023E345]
I... He was probably killed by the same people who want to kill me!

Id: [0x0023E346]
After everything I found, I know what's going on.

Id: [0x0023E347]
And what's that?

Id: [0x0023E348]
You started this all. They don't want you dead because of your family's wealth. You're only pretending to be a victim. I'd even guess the man you were supposed to marry was killed by the mercenary you hired.

Id: [0x0023E349]
I asked you to help me, not blame me. You were supposed to bring me the truth that would allow me to start my journey.

Id: [0x0023E34A]
You don't deserve any of this. You're only trying to live your life.

Id: [0x0023E34B]
Of course I am! I've done nothing wrong. I just want to have a healthy father and to start my journey.

Id: [0x0023E373]
Maybe we could... You know... like I was saying... Odysseus being a lover and all?

Id: [0x0023E3ED]
I'm only trying to help, General.

Id: [0x0023E421]
There you are. Let's see what you've gotten yourself into this time, Markos.

Id: [0x0023E43E]
Wow. I took you as someone being far more direct. And confident.

Id: [0x0023E43F]
I thought I'd try something new.

Id: [0x0023E442]
It's not far west of here. But I wouldn't mess with those bandits.

Id: [0x0023E443]
Thanks for the advice.

Id: [0x0023E4C7]
This tall grass will keep me hidden.

Id: [0x0023E4CA]
I am honored to meet you, Eagle Bearer. I can't wait to learn to fight like my brother, Theoros. And to hear all your stories of deadly monsters and glorious adventures!

Id: [0x0023E4EC]
This must be it. Looks cozy.

Id: [0x0023E4EE]
Don't worry, you will soon.

Id: [0x0023E4EF]
My life is being wasted standing around here.

Id: [0x0023E4F0]
A lot can happen in a small amount of time, trust me.

Id: [0x0023E4F1]
If this has shown anything, it's that you should give up on that journey now. Why get yourself into more trouble?

Id: [0x0023E4F2]
Because it's my choice. If my life leads me to trouble, so be it! The best stories start when something big happens.

Id: [0x0023E4F3]
Maybe, but you can't force those things to happen just because you want them to.

Id: [0x0023E580]
You can start that after we have a little fun.

Id: [0x0023E581]
You're joking, right? You just told me this whole thing is my fault. The last thing I want to do is sleep with you.

Id: [0x0023E582]
Thought I'd try.

Id: [0x0023E583]
I feel like I'm still recovering from the last time I slept with you.

Id: [0x0023E584]
It was worth a shot.

Id: [0x0023E585]
So that's it then. I guess there's nothing else to do.

Id: [0x0023E586]
I do enjoy your attempts. Tell me, what is it that's meant to make me swoon this time?

Id: [0x0023E600]
I hope you're right.

Id: [0x0023E604]
I'll have to go up top to get dressed.

Id: [0x0023E60F]
The water? I'll have to take a look.

Id: [0x0023E613]
It's really something that has to be experienced...

Id: [0x0023E614]
Show me.

Id: [0x0023E615]
You're right. Experiencing that was far better than just hearing about it.

Id: [0x0023E616]
Told you.

Id: [0x0023E617]
If you undress me, I think you'll find out.

Id: [0x0023E618]
I can do that.

Id: [0x0023E61C]
Mmm... That <i>was</i> enough to make me swoon.

Id: [0x0023E61D]
Told you.

Id: [0x0023E61E]
Uh... if I'm being honest, I didn't think about what to say next.

Id: [0x0023E61F]
That's a first! You always seem to know exactly what you want to say. It's impressive, really.

Id: [0x0023E620]
First time for everything.

Id: [0x0023E621]
Let's not talk, then.

Id: [0x0023E625]
Funny, it seems words escape me now, too.

Id: [0x0023E626]
Always a good sign.

Id: [0x0023E627]
It doesn't have to be goodbye. Why not join my crew?

Id: [0x0023E628]
You're right. I hope to hear stories about you in the future, Odessa.

Id: [0x0023E629]
Oh, you will. You'll see.

Id: [0x0023E62A]
Hmm... Well, you were always on my side. Plus, getting away from here would be nice.

Id: [0x0023E62B]
Great. What about your father?

Id: [0x0023E62C]
After you sided against me and said it was my fault?

Id: [0x0023E62D]
[&breath]Fine. What else am I going to do?

Id: [0x0023E62E]
That's the spirit.

Id: [0x0023E6BB]
I need to hit harder to get past his shield.

Id: [0x0023E70F]
I need to sneak up on them.

Id: [0x0023E712]
I couldn't say.

Id: [0x0023E713]
At least I have you working with me, instead of getting in my way.

Id: [0x0023E717]
What's the meaning of this?

Id: [0x0023E719]
By all the gods, what have you done?!

Id: [0x0023E721]
Please don't ask me that. The ones who want to punish me now, the ones who told me what to say... They would bury you alive if I told you about them.

Id: [0x0023E722]
The ones with masks and dark cloaks. The Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x0023E725]
I came here to get revenge against the man that tried to murder me, and that's what I did.

Id: [0x0023E726]
Traitor!

Id: [0x0023E728]
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but he left me no choice. You don't know what happened between us in the past. This was his doing.

Id: [0x0023E729]
You and your lies can go straight to fucking Hades!

Id: [0x0023E72B]
I don't need to know why to kill you.

Id: [0x0023E748]
I'll see you at the camp.

Id: [0x0023E749]
Very well, but don't delay. We attack soon.

Id: [0x0023E74B]
Would you be, were you me? They challenge all that Athens stands for. They care nothing for art, or education, or philosophy. For them, warfare is the only goal.

Id: [0x0023E74C]
Strange thing to hear from a general in the Athenian army.

Id: [0x0023E74D]
I serve Athens with arms because I am skilled with fighting and strategy. But I protect those who serve our culture and legacy.

Id: [0x0023E74E]
They're lucky to have you.

Id: [0x0023E74F]
I've earned my place. Would you be interested in more work removing Spartan commanders?

Id: [0x0023E7B0]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x0023E7B4]
I can match my bounty and then some, I'm sure.

Id: [0x0023E7B6]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0023E7BC]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x0023E7C0]

Id: [0x0023E7C8]
Please, let my drachmae change your mind.

Id: [0x0023E7CB]
She can do no more harm. Killing her for revenge won't change what happened.

Id: [0x0023E7F1]
I can match my bounty and then some, I'm sure.

Id: [0x0023E7F3]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0023E7F9]

Id: [0x0023E81D]
I can pay, <i>misthios</i>! Whatever that fool is giving you, I'll top it.

Id: [0x0023E821]
The gods have decided my fate, then.

Id: [0x0023E827]
So be it.

Id: [0x0023E82B]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0023E82D]

Id: [0x0023E84F]
All right. My destiny is out of my hands.

Id: [0x0023E853]
I'm to leave my family behind and sail with a mercenary sent to kill me. [beat]So be it.

Id: [0x0023E855]
I must abandon my life here completely to avoid death? [beat]Fine, if that's what it takes.

Id: [0x0023E873]
No one has to die here. What would it take to make you walk away?

Id: [0x0023E877]
No, please. There must be something I can do to change your mind.

Id: [0x0023E87B]

I won't leave my life behind to work for <i>you</i>, mercenary. Just kill me.

Id: [0x0023E897]
How do I know you're not just going to feed me to the sharks? I hate sharks.

Id: [0x0023E8B1]

Id: [0x0023E8D9]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023E8DD]
She still seems to be an active concern from what I've heard. Do you have any proof that she's been dealt with?

Id: [0x0023E8E2]
I really think I would have heard from her by now if she were free. Do you have any proof that you finished the job?

Id: [0x0023E8E4]
I'd like to take you at your word that the beast has gone free, but... do you have any proof that the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023E8E9]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0023E8F0]
I'd like to believe you but... something's off. Do you have any proof they've been destroyed?

Id: [0x0023E8F4]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x0023E8F6]
I'd like to take you at your word, but... I'm sure you must have some evidence that they really are all dead.

Id: [0x0023E8F8]
It feels strange that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any evidence that he's no longer vulnerable?

Id: [0x0023E8FA]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0023E8FC]
Until we know each other better... Do you have any proof it's been destroyed?

Id: [0x0023E902]
Seems odd that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any proof he's free?

Id: [0x0023E904]
Last I heard, he was still causing trouble. Do you have any proof that he's no longer a concern?

Id: [0x0023E999]
Any idea where I should look for your husband?

Id: [0x0023E99A]
Don't worry, I'll find him.

Id: [0x0023E99B]
I'm sure if your husband came across any trouble, he'd offer to pay his way out of it.

Id: [0x0023E99C]
With what drachmae?! The captain at the Dystos Fort bled us dry. Without his drachmae to hide behind, my husband isn't safe!

Id: [0x0023E99F]
He's been trying to find ways to get his shipments past the Dagger's forces on the road east of here. Any time his carts ride by, the troops on patrol take a cut. More of their godsless <i>malákes </i>taxes.

Id: [0x0023E9A2]
I've heard enough. I'll head east and find your husband.

Id: [0x0023E9A3]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023E9AA]
You saved me!

Id: [0x0023E9AC]
Some men took the Doctor away towards the m... mines[2306606], north of here. He's been gone for a long time.

Id: [0x0023E9AF]
I'll look for him.

Id: [0x0023E9B0]
Bring... bring him back, please. They brought him north, towards the mines[2306606].

Id: [0x0023E9B1]
I don't... remember. I just know that the Doctor saved us and cares for us here.

Id: [0x0023E9B5]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0023E9B7]
Please hurry. We're getting worse with each passing day.

Id: [0x0023E9B9]
I have... unpaid debts to collect.

Id: [0x0023E9BB]
No.

Id: [0x0023E9BF]
I see. Anyone in particular come to mind?

Id: [0x0023E9C0]
I don't want to fight right now.

Id: [0x0023E9C1]
As you wish, <i>misthios</i>...

Id: [0x0023E9C9]
What happened here?

Id: [0x0023E9CB]
Guards... Malákes corrupt guards... They wanted "taxes." They always want "taxes"[coughs blood]... Took my master up to the Dystos Fort... He should've paid their stupid taxes... He - he should've paid...

Id: [0x0023E9D5]
I better head to the fort[2105505].

Id: [0x0023E9DF]
More wheat. Must be getting closer.

Id: [0x0023E9EE]
Dystos Fort. I doubt the guards will be happy to see me.

Id: [0x0023E9F3]
A man named Agapios believes you may be able to identify the Kingfisher. If I find out who he is, I can stop the Dagger.

Id: [0x0023E9F5]
Your wife hired me to check on you. She was worried.

Id: [0x0023E9F7]
[&laughs]So you have met her. Is there anything I can help you with?

Id: [0x0023EA03]
Finally, I'm free! I knew they couldn't hold me for long!

Id: [0x0023EA04]
No thanks needed.

Id: [0x0023EA05]
Yes, yes. Many thanks for saving me. But I must get back, my pets are waiting for me! Did they send you?

Id: [0x0023EA09]
Your "pets" must have a history.

Id: [0x0023EA1B]
Not sure what pets you're talking about.

Id: [0x0023EA25]
I'll get rid of them. I expect the medicine when I return.

Id: [0x0023EA28]
And win riches beyond your wildest dreams of course... If you were to fight and win.

Id: [0x0023EA33]
I think Barnabas knows what he wants to do. I'll stay out of this for now.

Id: [0x0023EA4B]
I think the trouble is real, Barnabas. You should go to him. Mikkos told me not to return without help, and I mean not to.

Id: [0x0023EA4E]
Akrisios, the king of Argos, was not a good man. He had one child, a daughter, Danae. Bitter that he had no son, he went to the Oracle of Delphi, and heard a prophecy that chilled him.

Id: [0x0023EA4F]
However, Mighty Zeus saw the girl and fell in love with her. He transformed into a golden shower and seduced her. Danae gave birth to a son, Perseus.

Id: [0x0023EA50]
King Akrisios couldn't kill the boy for fear of angering Zeus, so he put his daughter and grandson in a wooden crate and tossed them into the wild sea, to be drowned.

Id: [0x0023EA54]
And you, <i>misthios</i>? I need <i>someone</i> to go see about Neleus.

Id: [0x0023EA59]
Arrangements can be made.

Id: [0x0023EA5A]
And a lot of drachmae! Well, I'll give you all I've got. If Aetios picks me, I'll be sure to give you even more!

Id: [0x0023EA61]
I'll help Barnabas's nephew however I can.

Id: [0x0023EA62]
Neleus lives with his caretaker, Mikkos. Their house is just up the hill north of here.

Id: [0x0023EA66]
Do you want to meet Neleus now?

Id: [0x0023EA69]
Perseus and his mother, Danae, were rescued on the island of Seriphos, and Perseus grew up under the care of a kindly fisherman, Diktys.

Id: [0x0023EA6A]
Maybe. Perseus learned to swim, and ride, and fight, and how to be good and just, even though his father was only a fisherman.

Id: [0x0023EA70]
A kindly old couple, Amphitryon and Alkmene found Perseus in the sea and brought him to their farm in Smalpolis, taking him as their son.

Id: [0x0023EA71]
What about his mom, my namesake?

Id: [0x0023EA72]
Shh, listen! Hera was angry, though, and sent snakes to kill the baby. But Perseus was too strong, and he strangled the snakes in his crib, revealing his godly nature.

Id: [0x0023EA73]
That doesn't sound right!

Id: [0x0023EA74]
There are different ways to tell the story, you know!

Id: [0x0023EA79]
I don't know, and I don't need to know. I just know that I was made to feed them my tonic in a strange cave similar to this one. If it fails, I get to keep my pets and care for them.

Id: [0x0023EA81]
These workers should know where to find the Doctor.

Id: [0x0023EA83]
Hush. Now, Diktys's brother was ruler of the island, but he was not a good man.

Id: [0x0023EA84]
The cruel king of Seriphos, Diktys's brother Polydektes, decided he wanted to marry Danae for she was still beautiful and noble. But Perseus knows his mother does not want this.

Id: [0x0023EA86]
When Perseus grows up, he travels to Joppa and falls in love at first sight with the beautiful princess Andromeda.

Id: [0x0023EA88]
Yes, yes! Run before they put us both in there!

Id: [0x0023EA8D]
The Doctor should be there.

Id: [0x0023EA92]
Hey, you! Get me out of here. Quickly!

Id: [0x0023EAA3]
The Dagger - dramatic name. Any particular reason?

Id: [0x0023EAA4]
They stab at Euboea without honor – from the shadows, unseen, bleeding our nation of it’s lifeblood. A dramatic name, perhaps - but apt.

Id: [0x0023EAA7]
A concern about what?

Id: [0x0023EAA8]
How do we know that this <i>misthios</i> isn't one of the people who took it in the first place?

Id: [0x0023EAAB]
It's just... you look more like a hired killer than a hero.

Id: [0x0023EAB2]
Your wife seems... nice.

Id: [0x0023EAB3]
She does have her tastes. [&ah]Expensive ones.[&laughs]

Id: [0x0023EAB8]
Killing him won't solve anything, Prexileos!

Id: [0x0023EAB9]
But we can't just sit here and let him do this to us, Idyia! <i>To the children!</i>

Id: [0x0023EABA]
You think I don't have their wellbeing in mind?!

Id: [0x0023EABB]
Well, you certainly aren't <i>acting </i>like it.

Id: [0x0023EABC]
How dare you!

Id: [0x0023EAC7]
I won't let you do something this stupid!

Id: [0x0023EAC8]
That Dagger sympathizer has to die! He'll keep making us do his dirty work if I don't stop him.

Id: [0x0023EAC9]
They'll just do it all the same!

Id: [0x0023EAD4]
B-but one day, she came back, <i>misthios</i>. Her favorite white robe was all red. And she told me -

Id: [0x0023EAD6]
To take care of myself and make more friends.

Id: [0x0023EADD]
The husband's secret stash.

Id: [0x0023EAE2]
Enough, you two!

Id: [0x0023EAE5]
Calm down and listen to yourselves. The kids are scared.

Id: [0x0023EAF8]
I knew it! It must have been amazing to win! Tell us, what do we need to do to become champions?

Id: [0x0023EAFB]
You're on your own. I'll find another way to see to Agapios's requests.

Id: [0x0023EAFD]
Please, <i>misthios.</i> Just hear me out!

Id: [0x0023EB02]
Deal. I will take care of your problem.

Id: [0x0023EB0A]
This is some strong stuff.

Id: [0x0023EB0F]
Have you heard of that pirate woman, Xenia?

Id: [0x0023EB12]
The <i>misthios</i> is right, calm down. It's bad for the -

Id: [0x0023EB14]
There's a man from the Dagger - he approached us one day to help them spread their <i>agenda</i>.

Id: [0x0023EB15]
I need to know everything I can about the Dagger.

Id: [0x0023EB16]
They have such ambition. A <i>legendary</i> greed. They appear to be pirates, yet they're organized, funded, well connected... There may be more than just the Kingfisher pulling their strings.

Id: [0x0023EB1A]
Whatever you know about the Kingfisher, I also need to know.

Id: [0x0023EB1B]
[&laughs]He'd visit me, the Kingfisher and his malákas flock, demanding their taxes. I kept him fed, I kept him rich. If I tell you his name... I'm a dead man.

Id: [0x0023EB1C]
Say it.

Id: [0x0023EB1F]
It's great to see you again. Have you come for some olive oil?

Id: [0x0023EB20]
No. I came to talk to you about the Dagger.

Id: [0x0023EB21]
I've got nothing to say about that.

Id: [0x0023EB22]
Look, I'm here to let you know that I'm working with the local magistrate and his worker, Agapios, to bring them down. But in order to do that, I need to know what you know.

Id: [0x0023EB24]
Save that wine for Xenia!

Id: [0x0023EB25]
I'm just pinching a little bit, she'll never know.

Id: [0x0023EB29]
It's been here for decades but, recently, it's changed.

Id: [0x0023EB2A]
As most things do.

Id: [0x0023EB2C]
<i>Maláka</i>. She's bad news.

Id: [0x0023EB2D]
I know, that's why I'm bringing it up! What if she, I don't know, has plans for these mushrooms that just came in?

Id: [0x0023EB2E]
What does a pirate need with mushrooms?!

Id: [0x0023EB2F]
I heard they can be made into weapons! Or a poison, I can't remember.

Id: [0x0023EB30]
Just shut up.

Id: [0x0023EB34]
Give me his name!

Id: [0x0023EB35]
Neritos! His name is Neritos. [beat]Just make sure you stop him.

Id: [0x0023EB39]
...Agapios's brother. It <i>is</i> him.

Id: [0x0023EB3E]
We don't care about the Dagger, but we needed the extra income.

Id: [0x0023EB3F]
He wanted us and the children to spread the message of the Dagger in the theater and on the streets.

Id: [0x0023EB40]
Sounds like a fair trade.

Id: [0x0023EB41]
Till the drachmae stopped coming in.

Id: [0x0023EB42]
He stopped paying us and threatened to come after our children if we didn't continue.

Id: [0x0023EB43]
I was going to kill him myself, but Idyia -

Id: [0x0023EB47]
You don't want to know what I know. Trust me.

Id: [0x0023EB48]
Tell me!

Id: [0x0023EB50]
Neritos. His name is Neritos.

Id: [0x0023EB52]
No. It can't be true.

Id: [0x0023EB54]
I'm going to end this once and for all.

Id: [0x0023EB56]
That will do.

Id: [0x0023EB6D]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>. Have you changed your mind about fighting in my arena?

Id: [0x0023EB71]
We can't just take a life like that, Prexileos!

Id: [0x0023EB7D]
He's just using you! Exploiting your children for sympathy.

Id: [0x0023EB7E]
And now he intends to do it for free.

Id: [0x0023EB81]
That's not us.

Id: [0x0023EB8B]
He lives in the large house in the middle of the city. Kill him, and we'll have drachmae for you.

Id: [0x0023EB9B]
I won't help you. I'll find out more about the Dagger on my own.

Id: [0x0023EB9C]
You would risk young children dying, <i>misthios</i>?!

Id: [0x0023EBA7]
I'll deal with the man. Just make sure you pay up.

Id: [0x0023EBA8]
What does that even mean?!

Id: [0x0023EBA9]
So you'll kill him, right?

Id: [0x0023EBBB]
<i>Misthios</i>, please. You have to help us kill this man from the Dagger.

Id: [0x0023EBBD]
<i>Misthios</i>, you have to help us get rid of the Dagger man threatening us!

Id: [0x0023EBBE]
What more do you want, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0023EBC4]
This Dagger man, where will I find him?

Id: [0x0023EBC5]
He lives in the biggest house in town. There are many guards there, so be careful.

Id: [0x0023EBC7]
You are... prolific creatures. Eros would be proud.

Id: [0x0023EBC8]
W-what are you saying?!

Id: [0x0023EBC9]
These kids aren't <i>really </i>ours. They're orphans.

Id: [0x0023EBCA]
Look at us now, one big happy family. And... I can't wait for it to expand again.

Id: [0x0023EBCC]
We just started taking them in one at a time. And -

Id: [0x0023EBCE]
Idiot. Don't make it sound weird.

Id: [0x0023EBCF]
I've got all I need. I'll deal with the man.

Id: [0x0023EBD1]
Remember - no killing. No blood.

Id: [0x0023EBD2]
Go now, <i>misthios</i>, do what you must. Thank you.

Id: [0x0023EBDD]
That'll be all I require. See you later.

Id: [0x0023EBE1]
Listen to yourself!

Id: [0x0023EBEC]
That's the big house they were talking about.

Id: [0x0023EBF2]
He didn't look too dangerous...

Id: [0x0023EBF6]
That's him. The Dagger man threatening the theater couple.

Id: [0x0023EBFC]
<i>Pater, </i>we're home! <i>Pater</i>? <i>Pater! Mater,</i> come quick!

Id: [0x0023EBFD]
My love? No!

Id: [0x0023EC02]
My love! No! No, no, no!

Id: [0x0023ECFE]
I hear good things from my commanders, mercenary. What news do you have?

Id: [0x0023ECFF]
The Athenian commander is dead. Megaris is ready to fall.

Id: [0x0023ED2A]
Are you ready to crush the Athenians?

Id: [0x0023ED6E]
It's good to see you again. Let's... leave the thing about the horse between us, yes?

Id: [0x0023ED7A]
The Athenians have blocked the entrance to the bay!

Id: [0x0023ED7E]
I'm ready for war.

Id: [0x0023ED80]
There's something I need to do first.

Id: [0x0023ED88]
So, tell me about the Wolf.

Id: [0x0023ED89]
He is a great man. He will lead Sparta to victory against the -

Id: [0x0023ED8A]
No, no! What is he like as a man, as a father?

Id: [0x0023ED8B]
He… he is to be admired, strong, caring in his way. But sometimes, I -

Id: [0x0023ED8C]
Yes?

Id: [0x0023ED8D]
Nothing. Just, he gets this faraway look in his eyes, and I sense a sadness there.

Id: [0x0023ED8F]
He is Sparta's general, but he is also made of flesh and blood. Life cannot be lived without some regrets.

Id: [0x0023EEB2]
I never say no to good wine and good company.

Id: [0x0023EEB3]
I expected no less from you.

Id: [0x0023EEB6]
Thank you for offering. I don't like to dull my senses this close to battle. I will stay and keep you and your men company through the night.

Id: [0x0023EEB7]
Chaperoned by a messenger of Zeus? This will be interesting.

Id: [0x0023EEC0]
The cruel, uh, stinky king became angry. To get rid of Perseus, Polydektes sent him on an impossible quest.

Id: [0x0023EEC4]
You did it. We're through!

Id: [0x0023EF3D]
I wish it were that simple. Ever since the Wolf of Sparta was killed, rumors have been spreading. People say he's continuing his campaign against Athens from beyond the grave.

Id: [0x0023EF3E]
And these wolves are supposed to be his revenge?

Id: [0x0023EF3F]
So say the rumors, and my troops believe it.

Id: [0x0023EF48]
Surely this is the after effects of the mushrooms. I remember the chicken coop. I remember the farmer's field. I do not remember building a Trojan horse.

Id: [0x0023EF49]
We offer it to the gods for safe passage across the seas! Boys, let's move this down to the beach!

Id: [0x0023EF4F]
I didn't even drink last night. Why am I seeing a Trojan horse?

Id: [0x0023EF50]
We can offer it to Poseidon Earth-Shaker for safe passage across the sea!

Id: [0x0023EF51]
Careful, this was a trap the last time.

Id: [0x0023EF56]
You don't think much of Spartan leadership.

Id: [0x0023EF57]
When I rise, they'll bow.

Id: [0x0023EF58]
Many generals have had military training.

Id: [0x0023EF59]
Handed to them. I scraped and fought for sponsorship and respect.

Id: [0x0023EF5A]
I know what it means to scrape by.

Id: [0x0023EF5B]
Ah. But poverty cuts the soul.

Id: [0x0023EF62]
Hmm, this has been quite profitable. Maybe I should hunt down more mercenaries.

Id: [0x0023EF64]
Never say you are better than the gods!

Id: [0x0023EF65]
Thetis proclaims that Andromeda must be sacrificed to the gods, or else the whole city of Joppa will be destroyed!

Id: [0x0023EF66]
I... don't think that's right. Wasn't Andromeda an Aithiopian princess?

Id: [0x0023EF67]
Hush! Perseus asks his grandmother, Tala, how to save his love. She turns into a manta ray and says, to save Andromeda, he must bring back curly hair of gold, fit for the king of the mountains, who yet owns less than the humblest helot.

Id: [0x0023EF6A]
You've made it further than most leaders.

Id: [0x0023EF70]
I once boasted to a friend that I was a better tactician than Odysseus himself... Today I was proven wrong.

Id: [0x0023EF71]
You live to fight another day. Learn from this.

Id: [0x0023EF74]
And do you think that's your edge?

Id: [0x0023EF75]
My very sharp edge.

Id: [0x0023EFB7]
If there is, it would be at his home.

Id: [0x0023EFB8]
Then go there.

Id: [0x0023EFB9]
If there's proof he's after you, it would be at his home. I could check.

Id: [0x0023EFBA]
You would do that for me?

Id: [0x0023EFE3]
Enough talk.

Id: [0x0023EFE6]
You there, <i>misthios</i>! Fight by my side!

Id: [0x0023EFEB]
Did Sparta answer your call for help?

Id: [0x0023EFEC]
A polemarch named Thaletas and a handful of Spartans landed on Mykonos not long before you.

Id: [0x0023EFED]
It's their camp we're headed to, isn't it?

Id: [0x0023EFEE]
Thaletas needs <i>our</i> help now, though he'd never admit it.

Id: [0x0023EFEF]
Sounds Spartan all right.

Id: [0x0023EFF4]
How are your supplies?

Id: [0x0023EFF5]
Podarkes's men have set up strongholds across the islands. They're blocking trade routes and stealing our food.

Id: [0x0023EFF6]
And weapons?

Id: [0x0023EFF7]
[&breath]Our blades are old. Some of us don't even have armor. Meanwhile, the Athenians have smiths working day and night.

Id: [0x0023EFF8]
Those soldiers on the beach were armed to the teeth.

Id: [0x0023EFF9]
Thaletas, how many Spartans have come to fight?

Id: [0x0023EFFA]
My ship arrived with a full crew. Only twelve made it to shore.

Id: [0x0023EFFB]
You think this is hopeless, don't you?

Id: [0x0023EFFC]
I doesn't matter what I think. What matters is what we do.

Id: [0x0023F00D]
Guards! Kill her!

Id: [0x0023F012]
You will die for standing against us, <i>child!</i>

Id: [0x0023F017]
You've been a thorn in my side since you landed.

Id: [0x0023F018]
Soon I'm going to be a blade in your throat.

Id: [0x0023F019]
Even if you kill me, you will lose, Eagle Bearer. We are everywhere. There isn't a rock you can hide under where we won't find you.

Id: [0x0023F01A]
You are the snakes who hide! I'm going to bury you so deep only Hades will find you.

Id: [0x0023F022]
[&custom]Psst.[/&custom] Misthios! [beat]You, with the eagle. Over here.

Id: [0x0023F02B]
Thank you for freeing me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0023F033]
Kassandra! Great to see you celebrating. But where's Kyra?

Id: [0x0023F037]
Podarkes is dead because of you. We owe you that.

Id: [0x0023F03B]
You fought well in battle, misthios.

Id: [0x0023F03F]
Misthios! Over here!

Id: [0x0023F04A]
Get him!

Id: [0x0023F050]
He's dying!

Id: [0x0023F056]
Thaletas! No!

Id: [0x0023F05C]
Is the fugitive the man you saved?

Id: [0x0023F062]
That was your father - it's not safe for you here anymore.

Id: [0x0023F068]
Stop that man!

Id: [0x0023F06C]
Thaletas... He's...

Id: [0x0023F070]
Find the man who did this.

Id: [0x0023F07E]
Why would that man jeopardize his family to kill a Spartan?

Id: [0x0023F084]
Some celebration.

Id: [0x0023F088]
Must have been hemlock.

Id: [0x0023F08C]
My general is dead.

Id: [0x0023F092]
We should head to the palace[2425521] while we have the chance.

Id: [0x0023F095]
And it made him a <i>legend</i>.

Id: [0x0023F0AA]
Please thank my wife for her festive gift.

Id: [0x0023F0AB]
I don't know if I should thank her or curse her.

Id: [0x0023F0AF]
Thank you, misthios! But you were too gentle with those pigs.

Id: [0x0023F0B0]
Keep your opinion to yourself. You've caused enough trouble. Now follow me.

Id: [0x0023F0B5]
Thank you, misthios! They were going to kill me. But you killed them first!

Id: [0x0023F0B6]
There will be more. Hurry, follow me.

Id: [0x0023F0B7]
I saw you. You loved spilling blood on sacred soil, just like me!

Id: [0x0023F0B8]
I'm nothing like you. Now shut up and follow me before you get us killed.

Id: [0x0023F0BD]
Death to our oppressors. And anyone else who tries to claim the Delos Islands. Delians are free!

Id: [0x0023F0BE]
More Delians will die if you don't shut up.

Id: [0x0023F0BF]
Silence is what led to this. I'll scream till my lungs bleed, and all soldiers are dead!

Id: [0x0023F0C0]
<i>Maláka!</i>

Id: [0x0023F0CF]
Victory is close. I can feel it.

Id: [0x0023F0D0]
We haven't won yet. The fort will be treacherous, and the gods can be fickle.

Id: [0x0023F0D1]
It was the gods who sent you to me - I refuse to believe they'd send you here to die. So, what do you think of our islands?

Id: [0x0023F0D2]
I think I prefer Mykonos. They really don't like you shedding blood on Delos.

Id: [0x0023F0D3]
[&laughs]The priests are so terrified of desecrating the sacred grounds of Apollo, women about to give birth are shipped over to Mykonos.

Id: [0x0023F0D4]
What happens if they don't make it to shore?

Id: [0x0023F0D6]
[&laughs]Boat babies.[/&laughs]

Id: [0x0023F0DB]
I'll keep an eye out for reinforcements.

Id: [0x0023F0DC]
And don't you die on me!

Id: [0x0023F0E4]
An Athenian camp.

Id: [0x0023F0E5]
Don't stir up that nest. Would spoil the mood.

Id: [0x0023F0E9]
There's a spot down here where I used to hunt as a young girl. It was hunt or starve in those days.

Id: [0x0023F0EA]
Same for me. I started by catching and cooking rodents.

Id: [0x0023F0EB]
Ha! They make a good soup. But look how far you've come.

Id: [0x0023F0EC]
How far <i>we've</i> come.

Id: [0x0023F0ED]
There. Isn't it beautiful?

Id: [0x0023F0EE]
It is. Now show me how you use that bow.

Id: [0x0023F9BB]
Delians have suffered for so long. This is the first time I've felt happiness since the war began.

Id: [0x0023F9BC]
You can bring that to your people. These islands deserve peace - so do you.

Id: [0x0023F9BD]
And what about you? When this is all done, we could always use another set of capable hands.

Id: [0x0023F9BE]
My journey isn't over yet, but I may settle down some day.

Id: [0x0023F9BF]
You can do many things, <i>misthios</i>. But settle down? I'm not so sure.

Id: [0x0023F9C0]
Another challenge?

Id: [0x0023F9C1]
Stop looking to the future to be happy, when true happiness is right in front of you. You taught me that.

Id: [0x0023F9CD]
Loyalty makes for a poor payday.

Id: [0x0023F9CE]
What about trust? How do I know you aren't playing both sides?

Id: [0x0023F9CF]
With so many lives on the line, General, it seems dangerous to rely on trust.

Id: [0x0023F9DB]
You're food for the sharks now, Athenians!

Id: [0x0023F9E0]
Thaletas sends his regards, Athenian scum!

Id: [0x0023F9E5]
By Ares, that should do it! Though, if we sink more, the Athenian forces will crumble.

Id: [0x0023F9E6]
That's the spirit, Barnabas!

Id: [0x0023F9EC]
Spartans! Many brothers were lost to the Athenian dogs. But we are still here!

Id: [0x0023F9ED]
The Battle of the Three Hundred? Leonidas was lucky to have that many men!

Id: [0x0023F9EF]
Today we honor the fallen. Today we send our enemies to Hades!

Id: [0x0023F9F1]
Kyra will fight and die for her people. We will do the same!

Id: [0x0023F9F2]
We don't go home until these islands are ours. Delos called. Sparta answered!

Id: [0x0023FA02]
Where are you taking me?

Id: [0x0023FA03]
To one of my favorite spots on all the Delos Islands.

Id: [0x0023FA04]
Isn't a Spartan's favorite spot the battlefield?

Id: [0x0023FA05]
[&laughs]Fair enough. I'm taking you to my second favorite spot.

Id: [0x0023FA06]
[&ah]When I got here, I had just lost so many people. Every man I ever looked up to sank on that ship.

Id: [0x0023FA07]
You needed a place to get away from all this death. I understand.

Id: [0x0023FA08]
I knew you would. That's why I'm showing it to you. This place isn't just where I go to clear my thoughts. It...

Id: [0x0023FA09]
It what?

Id: [0x0023FA0A]
It reminds me of home.

Id: [0x0023FA1C]
You aren't a child. Stop acting like one.

Id: [0x0023FA6A]
Wanting what Odysseus had without trying would be childish. I'm willing to do whatever is necessary.

Id: [0x0023FA6B]
If you keep trying, you'll get there. Giving up guarantees you never will.

Id: [0x0023FA6C]
You're the first one to encourage me like that.

Id: [0x0023FA6D]
You look cute right now. As if nothing can get in your way.

Id: [0x0023FA6E]
I don't <i>usually</i> like being called cute.

Id: [0x0023FA7E]
Thank you for aiding all of us in Pitana. Stories of you will live amongst us for many years.

Id: [0x0023FA7F]
I help where I can. But thank you.

Id: [0x0023FB02]
Let's get this on.

Id: [0x0023FB05]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x0023FB06]
I'm Odessa. Named after the great Odysseus.

Id: [0x0023FB07]
There are a few other ones I can think of that would suit you.

Id: [0x0023FB09]
I can't wait to hear them.

Id: [0x0023FB0A]
How about beautiful? That works even better. The other ones will come later.

Id: [0x0023FB0B]
I hope "later" comes soon.

Id: [0x0023FB0C]
In time you'll learn to love all the things I have to tell you.

Id: [0x0023FB0D]
You seem so certain.

Id: [0x0023FB0E]
I've had lots of success in the past.

Id: [0x0023FB0F]
I'm sure you have.

Id: [0x0023FB10]
All right, you're ugly then.

Id: [0x0023FB14]
That's... not what I meant at all. I can't tell if you're serious or not.

Id: [0x0023FB15]
Greatness is what I seek. It's what I've desired my entire life. I refuse to end up like everyone around me, content to go about their daily lives until they're forgotten in death.

Id: [0x0023FB16]
No surprise there. Well, thanks for the help.

Id: [0x0023FB1A]
Here's where the ambush happened. I should look around.

Id: [0x0023FB1C]
That's easier said than done.

Id: [0x0023FB1D]
Just know it's your decision to make.

Id: [0x0023FB1E]
So what do you think?

Id: [0x0023FB1F]
I think I was in a much poorer mood before now. There's just so much I desire. To be as great as Odysseus... Where do I even begin?

Id: [0x0023FB25]
Kassandra! I'm here! Untie me!

Id: [0x0023FB2C]
Guess this is the vineyard... Straight ahead.

Id: [0x0023FB32]
My spies tell me Athenians have gained ground. Infiltrate the forts and attack their command. Understand?

Id: [0x0023FB9F]
Help! Please!

Id: [0x0023FBA0]
Don't leave! I beg you!

Id: [0x0023FBA6]
And?

Id: [0x0023FBA7]
He's a carpenter. Pirates took his brother. He'll work for us if we rescue him.

Id: [0x0023FBA8]
Then let's hunt some pirates!

Id: [0x0023FBAA]
Put your backs into it, men! Row like the Cerberus is snapping at your heels!

Id: [0x0023FBB1]
And?

Id: [0x0023FBB2]
He's a carpenter. Pirates took his brother. He'll work for us if we rescue him.

Id: [0x0023FBB3]
Then let's hunt some pirates!

Id: [0x0023FBB5]
Put your backs into it, men! Row like the Cerberus is snapping at your heels!

Id: [0x0023FBBB]
Your brother sent me.

Id: [0x0023FBBC]
That fool, always sending someone else to do his dirty work.

Id: [0x0023FBBD]
How bad is it?

Id: [0x0023FBC5]
You're going to be fine.

Id: [0x0023FBC6]
You're kind. A terrible liar, but kind.

Id: [0x0023FBC9]
The end is near.

Id: [0x0023FBCA]
Never thought I'd die like this, stuck on some shit island... Pfft, I hate the sea.

Id: [0x0023FBCD]
What message should I give your brother?

Id: [0x0023FBCE]
Tell that fool of a brother I... I...

Id: [0x0023FBD8]
Oh, thank the gods you came!

Id: [0x0023FBD9]
What happened? Where's the rest of your crew?

Id: [0x0023FBDA]
Pirates. They killed most of us, but they took my brother! Please, you must help him!

Id: [0x0023FBE3]
I'm not about to risk my neck or ship for some sailor’s brother. Unless of course there’s drachmae involved...

Id: [0x0023FBE6]
I'll help find your brother, sailor.

Id: [0x0023FBE9]
I'm not a sailor, I'm a carpenter. So's my brother. Our father taught us.

Id: [0x0023FBEA]
Interesting. Our ship could use a carpenter.

Id: [0x0023FBEB]
I've worked as a shipwright, repaired hulls with holes the size of Poseidon's fist... Please, save my brother, and I'll join your crew.

Id: [0x0023FBEC]
Then it's a deal.

Id: [0x0023FBF2]
Where can we find these pirates?

Id: [0x0023FBF3]
There is an island west of Boeotia and south of Mount Helikon. I hear they sail from there.

Id: [0x0023FBF4]
Anything else that might help?

Id: [0x0023FBF5]
I don't know, it happened so fast. Because of the war, there's more pirates about than ticks on a sow these days, but their camp can't be far.

Id: [0x0023FBF6]
We'll find these pirates and rescue your brother.

Id: [0x0023FBF9]
Did you find my brother? Where is he?

Id: [0x0023FBFD]
Will we be there soon?

Id: [0x0023FC04]
To save his own life, he chose to work for the pirates. They would have killed him otherwise. There was nothing I could do.

Id: [0x0023FC06]
What? My brother would rather die than work for pirates. Pirates killed our father last summer. He's hated everything about the sea since then. Tell me the truth!

Id: [0x0023FC07]
Your brother's dead. I didn't want to -

Id: [0x0023FC08]
You dare! You thought I was better thinking he lived than knowing the truth?

Id: [0x0023FC09]
I will not work for someone who holds the truth and family in so little regard!<LF>

Id: [0x0023FC0B]
I need to go. I wish to be alone with my pain.<LF>

Id: [0x0023FC0F]
He didn't survive. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0023FC11]
No, no, no! I curse you, gods!

Id: [0x0023FC12]
There were no gods on that ship, only pirates.

Id: [0x0023FC13]
I begged him to come on this trip. He hated the sea.

Id: [0x0023FC14]
A spear in my hand often helps me forget the pain. We'll put a hammer in yours if you honor your word.

Id: [0x0023FC15]
Of course... There's nothing left for me here.

Id: [0x0023FC1C]
I have no time for liars.

Id: [0x0023FC23]
Unlike Spartans, Athenians answer to the whims of ignorant peasants. It makes them slow to react. Spartans do what needs to be done. Such as eliminating enemy commanders.

Id: [0x0023FC35]
Perseus figured out what he needed - the golden fleece of the winged ram! Said to be guarded by a monster who could turn any to stone. Luckily, Perseus was blessed by the gods, and he was guided by Athena's golden-geared owl to the monster's lair...

Id: [0x0023FC37]
No!

Id: [0x0023FC38]
Huh?

Id: [0x0023FC39]
Perseus avoided the Catoblepas's killing gaze and snicked the sword, lopping off the creature's head.

Id: [0x0023FC3A]
Wait, the what? What's a Kraken?

Id: [0x0023FC3B]
Er, like a giant squid?

Id: [0x0023FC3C]
Don't you mean the sea monster, Ketos?

Id: [0x0023FC3D]
Pretty sure Homer said, "release the Kraken," not "release the Ketos."

Id: [0x0023FC3E]
You just made that up!

Id: [0x0023FC40]
Polydektes told Perseus to bring back the head of Medusa, the gorgon whose gaze could turn anyone who looked into her eyes to stone.

Id: [0x0023FC42]
Ooh!

Id: [0x0023FC43]
Ahh!

Id: [0x0023FC44]
But the evil king did not know Perseus was favored by the gods. Hermes gifted Perseus with winged sandals and a silver sickle, and Athena gave him a bronze shield, polished mirror-bright.

Id: [0x0023FC45]
Perseus flew to Medusa's lair, and used the shield to watch her reflection. He cut off her head with the sickle of Hermes. As she died, the winged foal Pegasos sprung from her neck!

Id: [0x0023FC46]
Yes!

Id: [0x0023FC47]
Flying home, Perseus found the maiden Andromeda chained on the Aithiopian cliffs, waiting to be sacrificed to the baleful sea monster, Ketos. Perseus used Medusa's head to turn Ketos to stone, rescued Andromeda, and married her.

Id: [0x0023FC48]
Take that, Ketos!

Id: [0x0023FC49]
Perseus returned home to find King Polydektes relentlessly pursuing Danae. They quarreled, and Perseus showed the king his wedding gift... When he saw Medusa's head, Polydektes turned to stone!

Id: [0x0023FC55]
Can't let the rest of those malákes get away.

Id: [0x0023FC62]
Making them slow to react.

Id: [0x0023FC63]
And that's where you come in. Infiltrate their forts and kill their polemarchs. I need the way clear for my troops.

Id: [0x0023FC68]
I might. What would you like me to do?

Id: [0x0023FC69]
I have other things to do for now.

Id: [0x0023FC6E]
Only you can bring the Athenians to victory, General. I'll let you have that.

Id: [0x0023FC6F]
The arrogance of Spartans.

Id: [0x0023FC7D]
You've done well. Our troops are on the move.

Id: [0x0023FC7E]
I'll kill the commanders and clear the way for your troops.

Id: [0x0023FC7F]
Start without me. I'll be back.

Id: [0x0023FC8B]
Perseus traveled to Argos with his family, and one day competed in the great athletic games. He hurled the discus, and his throw was so great that it shot into the stands and struck King Akrisios. So doing, Perseus killed his grandfather and fulfilled the prophecy.

Id: [0x0023FC8C]
You can't escape your fate!

Id: [0x0023FC8D]
In the end, Perseus and Andromeda settled in Mycenae as king and queen, and had seven sons and two daughters, the Perseids.

Id: [0x0023FC97]
Yes. I'll do as you ask and attack the commanders.

Id: [0x0023FC9A]
I'm sure you can handle them.

Id: [0x0023FCAD]
I don't really want that kind of fun right now.

Id: [0x0023FCD6]
That Markos is gonna be next.

Id: [0x0023FD0F]
E-everyone died. The plague came to Kephallonia. We lost everything.

Id: [0x0023FD15]
That was not all! Hades appears with a pack of giant scorpions called scorpiochs, and kills Andromeda and tries to kill Perseus!

Id: [0x0023FD16]
Huh?

Id: [0x0023FD17]
But Perseus throws his sword of Zeus at Hades, forcing him back into the underworld!

Id: [0x0023FD18]
Wait, wait, it's supposed to be Hermes's sickle! And Andromeda doesn't die!

Id: [0x0023FD19]
You're telling it wrong!

Id: [0x0023FD1A]
Uh... In the end, Perseus wins. Zeus offers to make him a god, but Perseus refuses. So instead, Zeus brings Andromeda back to life because she was only mostly dead.

Id: [0x0023FD20]
I'll kill the fort commanders if it's what must be done.

Id: [0x0023FD23]
Killing the commanders can wait.

Id: [0x0023FD2A]
Kill the Spartan commanders and bring me their seals as proof.

Id: [0x0023FD2C]
Only fools want war. And so far it seems both sides are made of fools.

Id: [0x0023FD31]
Wolves steal the animal sacrifices from this temple. I should look out.

Id: [0x0023FD33]
Let me ask you something first...

Id: [0x0023FD3F]
I'm interested.

Id: [0x0023FDA8]
I'm going to have to take care of that.

Id: [0x0023FDC4]
Athenians fail because they fear risk.

Id: [0x0023FDF1]
How could I have doubted your greatness? Nonetheless, I appreciate the work you've done. Would you be interested in another job?

Id: [0x0023FDFB]
I'm always interested in more work.

Id: [0x0023FE00]
I have some other jobs I need to do first.

Id: [0x0023FEBD]
You get started on the Spartans. I have other things to do right now.

Id: [0x0023FECF]
My soldiers think me bloodthirsty. I know the cost of war. Neither side will be clean of it.

Id: [0x0023FEDB]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0023FEED]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0023FEF1]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x0023FEF3]
I'd like to take you at your word, but... I'm sure you must have some evidence that they really are all dead.

Id: [0x0023FEF5]
Seems odd that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any proof he's free?

Id: [0x0023FEF7]
I really think I would have heard from her by now if she were free. Do you have any proof that you finished the job?

Id: [0x0023FEFA]
I'd like to take you at your word that the beast has gone free, but... do you have any proof that the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023FEFC]
Last I heard, he was still causing trouble. Do you have any proof that he's no longer a concern?

Id: [0x0023FEFE]
She still seems to be an active concern from what I've heard. Do you have any proof that she's been dealt with?

Id: [0x0023FF02]
Until we know each other better... Do you have any proof it's been destroyed?

Id: [0x0023FF06]
I'd like to believe you but... something's off. Do you have any proof they've been destroyed?

Id: [0x0023FF08]
It feels strange that I haven't heard from him, then. Do you have any evidence that he's no longer vulnerable?

Id: [0x0023FF0A]
I was expecting her to contact me once she was safe again. How do I know the job's been done?

Id: [0x0023FF24]
That was a great telling of the tale. I'll never forget it!

Id: [0x0023FF25]
Maybe the best! I can't wait to tell all my friends!

Id: [0x0023FF26]
Aw, thank you.

Id: [0x0023FF28]
I couldn't help overhearing the end of your story. Truly inspiring, Eagle Bearer. Thank you.

Id: [0x0023FF2A]
Tell me then, Eagle Bearer, you must be pleased with our progress.

Id: [0x0023FF42]
Wow, that was so wrong and so boring!

Id: [0x0023FF43]
You are a stinky storyteller, and that story was poop!

Id: [0x0023FF45]
I, ah, I'm sorry for your audience, Eagle Bearer. Though from what I heard, it did sound like you deviated somewhat from the traditional tale.

Id: [0x0023FF46]
Uh, apologies.

Id: [0x0023FF6E]
Come back when you've made the right choice.

Id: [0x0023FF82]
Athens will triumph.

Id: [0x0023FF83]
Then welcome to the winning side of history.

Id: [0x0023FF86]
I'm considering my options.

Id: [0x0023FF87]
Come back when you're ready to claim your place in the pantheon of heroes.

Id: [0x0023FF8F]
You try my patience! Decide!

Id: [0x0023FF94]
The commanders have shifted their troops.

Id: [0x0023FF95]
They're preparing to engage us in battle.

Id: [0x0023FF9F]
Welcome back. Have you finally made a decision?

Id: [0x0023FFA1]
I know you've played both sides like a typical <i>misthios</i>. But now it's time to choose: The winning side or pathetic failure.

Id: [0x0023FFBB]
All right. I assume you brought me proof? Like his head?

Id: [0x0023FFBD]
Very well. What do you have to show for it? Maybe a finger?

Id: [0x0023FFBF]
That's odd. I've heard it's still alive. Maybe you brought some proof that it's been slain?

Id: [0x00240043]
Thank you. Is... is there anything else I can tell you?

Id: [0x0024060C]
It's not a slave's place to question his orders.

Id: [0x00240616]
That's ridiculous, but I'll think about it. Now, tell me about the bandits.

Id: [0x00240618]
Other slaves in the area assure me that bandits from the northern hills of Mount Ochi are the ones ransacking the nearby homes.

Id: [0x00240675]
If she did, you're as good as dead.

Id: [0x00240679]
And once you've drained every last drop of it down your pretty throat, you will exude pure, irresistible beauty. Aetios will fall in love with you instantly!

Id: [0x00240683]
I'll make some goo-werry for you too for helping me!

Id: [0x00240684]
And I wouldn't mind some "joo-werry" myself.

Id: [0x00240688]
I should check in on her later...

Id: [0x0024068D]
That's the lagoon[2400870] with the pearls.

Id: [0x00240692]
Ah, the mines[2106124]. That's where the shiny stones are.

Id: [0x0024069C]
That's the shipwreck with the wine. Hope the pirates haven't gotten here yet.

Id: [0x002406A1]
That's the warehouse[2374589]. The wild mushrooms will be in there somewhere.

Id: [0x002406A8]
All this trouble over an old vase...

Id: [0x002406B1]
I can't believe that slave wants me to lie for him.

Id: [0x002406CB]
All these brave, brave souls...

Id: [0x002406EC]
Go on. Head up the coast towards the shipwrecks[2400534] to fight in my arena.

Id: [0x002406F7]
This looks expensive.<LF>

Id: [0x002406FC]
The bandits must've robbed a lot of homes.

Id: [0x0024070B]
<i>Misthios</i>. I never should've asked you to lie for me.

Id: [0x00240715]
Oh, you poor child. You're going to get absolutely destroyed in there.

Id: [0x00240719]
Rubbish!

Id: [0x0024071C]
[hmph]<i>You</i> won't be around for very long...

Id: [0x00240725]
You were right by not lying to my master. I don't know what I was thinking, but I'm glad you did what you did.

Id: [0x00240731]
Who do you think you are?

Id: [0x00240735]
Agapios sent me. He wants to prove his brother's innocence and destroy the Dagger.

Id: [0x00240736]
His brother? Neritos? Didn't he die on S -

Id: [0x00240737]
Stop, Idyia! We're in enough trouble as it is.

Id: [0x0024073C]
Thank you for returning my family vase and exposing my slave.

Id: [0x00240742]
Thank you for returning my family's vase.

Id: [0x00240746]
Tell me what you know.

Id: [0x00240747]
Let's make a deal.

Id: [0x00240748]
Kill a man for me, <i>misthios</i>. Help me, and I'll tell you about the Dagger's base of operations.

Id: [0x00240749]
We've been through this. No killing!

Id: [0x00240776]
I can't keep doing this... But I have to! I have to do this. For family.

Id: [0x00240777]
Yes, that's right. <i>For family.</i>

Id: [0x0024077F]
That must be Skoura...

Id: [0x0024078F]
They aren't many.

Id: [0x00240790]
But they're Heroes of the Arena. Those who earned an honorable death. The others are buried in unmarked holes far from here. Nobody remembers <i>them</i>.

Id: [0x002407E6]
You wanna fight someone in the arena?

Id: [0x002407E9]
You should've turned down <i>this </i>bounty, Talos.

Id: [0x00240830]
Waste of time!

Id: [0x0024084C]
Fine. I won't ask any more questions.

Id: [0x00240876]
Aim for the head. Always aim for the head.

Id: [0x00240877]
Shoot your arrow at those dummies!

Id: [0x0024088F]
As you said, tactics will win this.

Id: [0x00240890]
When this is over, I'll try my hand at politics.

Id: [0x0024089D]
My father. My mentor. My commander. You killed him!

Id: [0x0024089E]
You don't have to do this, Stentor. Put your weapon down.

Id: [0x0024089F]
Never, traitor. I've wanted to do this since I met you.

Id: [0x002408A4]
I said put your weapon down!

Id: [0x002408A8]
I won't... Let you... Get away with this.

Id: [0x002408A9]
Relent, Spartan!

Id: [0x002408C5]
Wouldn't want to be up against <i>you</i> with a bow.

Id: [0x002408C6]
I could say the same. You're a good shot.

Id: [0x002408D7]
The Spartans will have my head for this. I need to get out of here.

Id: [0x002408FB]
Do you think I'm an idiot? I know you betrayed me!

Id: [0x0024092B]
I'd rather die.

Id: [0x00240933]
Xerxes sends his sheep to slaughter. Come, Persian!

Id: [0x00240934]
Come and get it!

Id: [0x00240936]
I will bring Xerxes your head, you insolent Spartan fool!

Id: [0x0024093A]
Come, fool! Enough talk. Time to die.

Id: [0x0024093B]
Your bloodline ends today, Spartan. I'll get drunk on your blood as the crows feed on your eyes!

Id: [0x0024093C]
You will try, and you will fail.

Id: [0x00240941]
My <i>son</i> is more of a warrior than you.

Id: [0x00240942]
Once I’m done with you, king, all of Sparta’s sons will be slaves for Xerxes!

Id: [0x00240943]
Sparta's sons would rather die!

Id: [0x00240949]
Not so tough without your army to protect you!

Id: [0x0024094A]
Then why are you bleeding so much?

Id: [0x0024094F]
I should get this tablet back to the commander.

Id: [0x00240951]
Xerxes is the King of Kings! All will bow before him after I crush you!

Id: [0x00240952]
[laughs]That can be arranged.

Id: [0x002409C6]
Hate to break it to you, but clay pots and dirt aren't that wondrous to most.

Id: [0x00240CAE]
This is... unexpected.

Id: [0x00240CB2]
That is highly significant. The Mycenaeans were a warrior culture, you know. So this must be a warrior's tomb.

Id: [0x00240CBA]
I uncover our history. Sometimes... hopefully <i>this</i> time, it will uncover ancient wonders!

Id: [0x00240CC3]
I don't think that's possible. But that shrine <i>is</i> important to them. If it disappeared, maybe they'd get spooked and leave.

Id: [0x00240CDD]
Glad to hear it. So you dig through book roll?

Id: [0x00240CE2]
The sooner the better.

Id: [0x00240D05]
Are you mad?! We can still stop -

Id: [0x00240D06]
Enough! We will not stop.

Id: [0x00240D07]
I don't want to kill you, Alexios. But I <i>will</i> stop you.

Id: [0x00240D0E]
Why is it I always find you here?

Id: [0x00240D0F]
Athena is the goddess of wisdom. And war. What better place for a general to ask for blessings?

Id: [0x00240D10]
You don't seem very devout to me.

Id: [0x00240D14]
I come from a military family. We have a tradition of praying to Athena before battles. That's all.

Id: [0x00240D19]
If Brasidas dies, his blood is on your hands.

Id: [0x00240D1A]
His, yours, and every one of your friends'.

Id: [0x00240D1E]
My name [beat]is [beat]Deimos!

Id: [0x00240D1F]
I'm not the first general in my family. My father was as well, and his father before him.

Id: [0x00240D20]
You would have learned military thinking from a young age.

Id: [0x00240D21]
Exactly. My grandfather brought me here when I was a child. He stood me here and told me Athena was our patron. That we must always offer her our respect on the eve of war.

Id: [0x00240D22]
He sounds like a wise man.

Id: [0x00240D23]
He was. He died in battle the next day.

Id: [0x00240D24]
You come here to remember him.

Id: [0x00240D25]
And to remember that though the gods may be our patrons, they will not always protect us.

Id: [0x00240D29]
If I can find clues for where to look, are you interested in finding the other stele pieces?

Id: [0x00240D8D]
Even with only part of the stele, I can start to decipher the writing.

Id: [0x00240DA3]
I'll not have you men crying over them like <i>Antigone</i> over her dead brother.

Id: [0x00240DAA]
Prepare for battle, you cowering dogs! Seems you're not used to the smell of death.

Id: [0x00240DC6]
Looks like this victory will bring you glory.

Id: [0x00240DC8]
I think you're going to need all of them, though.

Id: [0x00240DC9]
According to this, it seems that the stele pieces have been deliberately separated.

Id: [0x00240DCF]
That's a lot of protection for the Pythia.

Id: [0x00240DD4]
Xenia and her crew really destroyed the place. If they burn everything, how do they expect to keep the people quiet?

Id: [0x00240DE6]
There are people claiming that it speaks to them. What could do that?

Id: [0x00240DEE]
You can't beat me, Alexios. Stop!

Id: [0x00240DEF]
Impossible. I am the chosen one.

Id: [0x00240DF6]
You really want me to embarrass you in front of your troops, brother?

Id: [0x00240DF7]
I am <i>not</i> your brother.

Id: [0x00240DFE]
The only reason you're alive is because of me! This is my reward?

Id: [0x00240DFF]
We were fine before you came. Boeotia was mine!

Id: [0x00240E05]
I will kill you, and your filthy bloodline will stop here.

Id: [0x00240E06]
No, Stentor. Not this time.

Id: [0x00240E0C]
Go with the Ferryman, brother.

Id: [0x00240E14]
We'll be watching you, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00240E15]
Ah, at least give them a welcome first.

Id: [0x00240E16]
Fine. Perikles welcomes you to his symposium.

Id: [0x00240E19]
I'll be back with your shell.

Id: [0x00240E1A]
It is your work that gives me riches, not theirs.

Id: [0x00240E23]
Got a job to do, Kassandra?

Id: [0x00240E28]
There's food being cooked near here...

Id: [0x00240E2A]
Stand down, Stentor. I'm not going easy on you.

Id: [0x00240E2B]
No - because I won't give you the chance.

Id: [0x00240E34]
I don't have time for this right now.

Id: [0x00240E35]
Yes. I'd like to know what's going on here.

Id: [0x00240E3E]
Kassandra! Good to see you.

Id: [0x00240E52]
<i>Chaire</i>. Need anything from a mercenary, athlete?

Id: [0x00240E57]
Anything I can do for you, athlete?

Id: [0x00240E5C]
Athlete... Need some help?

Id: [0x00240E64]
<i>Chaire</i>, scavenger. Need any help?

Id: [0x00240E69]
How goes your search, scavenger?

Id: [0x00240E6E]
Looking for something, scavenger?

Id: [0x00240E76]
Need some help, mercenary?

Id: [0x00240E7B]
Anything I can do for a fellow mercenary?

<i>Chaire</i>, huntress. Need anything?

Id: [0x00240F3B]
Anything a mercenary can help you with, huntress?

Id: [0x00240F46]
Thank you. Please, my grandmother's house is this way.

Id: [0x00240F56]
The sea is a muse for many, but not for me. My own muse wouldn't be too happy if I left.

Id: [0x00240F5A]
The confines of a ship aren't for me, <i>misthios</i>. I'm afraid I can't join you.

Id: [0x00240F5E]
This place isn't much, but it is my home. I can't leave it behind.

Id: [0x00240F65]
I'm no sailor, friend, and there is plenty here for me to write about with my feet on solid ground.

Id: [0x00240F69]
I appreciate the offer, mercenary, but my life is here - not on the open sea.

Id: [0x00240F6D]
My work is here, misthios. Not gallivanting across the Greek world with you, as tempting that may be.

Id: [0x00240F74]
The gods gave me hands for sculpting and painting, not rowing. I'm afraid I can't join you.

Id: [0x00240F78]
I wasn't made for the confines of a ship, friend. Or Poseidon's mighty waves. I can't join you.

Id: [0x00240F7C]
I appreciate the offer, but a sailor's life is far too short and dangerous for me, friend.

Id: [0x00240F80]
That's what you're worried about? We were just attacked.

Id: [0x00240F81]
Surely you should be used to that by now. Random bandits litter these lands. What did that letter you were reading say?

Id: [0x00240F82]
How could you say such a thing?

Id: [0x00240F83]
This letter is saying it. This wasn't a random attack.

Id: [0x00240F90]
My business is here, <i>misthios</i>. I can't leave that behind.

Id: [0x00240F94]
Abandon my livelihood on a whim? I appreciate what you've done, <i>misthios</i>, but that's not for me.

Id: [0x00240F98]
This life isn't always easy, but it is good to me. I won't leave it behind.

Id: [0x00240F9F]
I'm grateful for all you've done. Truly. But the life of a sailor is not for me.

Id: [0x00240FA3]
My family is here, <i>misthios</i>. I can't leave them behind.

Id: [0x00240FA7]
I'm not one for adventure, <i>misthios</i>. I've put down roots here.

Id: [0x00240FAE]
My work is done with my feet firmly planted on land, <i>misthios</i>. I can't go with you.

Id: [0x00240FB2]
I appreciate all you've done, <i>misthios</i>, but I can't imagine I'd make a great sailor.

Id: [0x00240FB6]
I'm a midwife, not a sailor. My work is here. I'm afraid I can't join you.

Id: [0x00240FC1]
I've got roots here, mercenary. I can't just leave that behind.

Id: [0x00240FC5]
My work is on land, not overseas, mercenary.

Id: [0x00240FC9]
I appreciate what you've done for me, but my family's here.

Id: [0x00240FD0]
Ha! We can't all just pick up and leave when we feel like it, friend.

Id: [0x00240FD4]
I've got a family to look after, mercenary. I can't join you.

Id: [0x00240FD8]
My whole life is here, <i>misthios</i>. I'm no traveler.

Id: [0x00240FDF]
I'm a hunter, not a fisher. My work is on land.

Id: [0x00240FE3]
Can't say I don't dream of adventure sometimes but... my life is here.

Id: [0x00240FE7]
I'm no sailor, mercenary. I keep my feet on solid ground.

Id: [0x00240FF4]
I can't abandon my training here, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00240FF8]
I must keep my discipline here if I hope to compete at the Olympics.

Id: [0x00240FFC]
I'm afraid I can't join you, mercenary. My life is here.

Id: [0x00241003]
I prefer to work alone, mercenary. More riches for me that way.

Id: [0x00241007]
Ha! And split the loot I find on my scavenges with you? Not likely.

Id: [0x0024100B]
I appreciate all you've done, mercenary, but I prefer to work alone.

Id: [0x00241012]
Don't you think more than one mercenary on a boat could get a little... crowded? I'm afraid I can't join you.

Id: [0x00241016]
Surely you know that mercenary work is best done alone.

Id: [0x0024101A]
And compete with someone of your skill for contracts? I don't think so.

Id: [0x0024101F]
When Xenia said a hole in the ground, she wasn't kidding.

Id: [0x00241029]
I never saw myself as a sailor, but I couldn't turn down the chance to travel with you. I'm in.

Id: [0x0024102D]
Sailing the Aegean with <i>you</i>? How could I say no?

Id: [0x00241031]
I look forward to our adventures at sea.

Id: [0x00241038]
I can find far more wealth traveling the Aegean with you. I'm in.

Id: [0x0024103C]
I thought you'd never ask. When do we set out, friend?

Id: [0x00241040]
Ready to set out when you are.

Id: [0x00241047]
The chance to sail with a mercenary as strong as you? Of course I'm in.

Id: [0x0024104B]
If you think there's room for two mercenaries on board, I'll join you.

Id: [0x0024104F]
Adventuring with you? I'm in.

Id: [0x00241059]
The sea has always been my greatest muse. It's time I get to know her better.

Id: [0x0024105D]
By Poseidon, I'll earn my place aboard your ship in no time.

Id: [0x00241061]
When do set out on our adventures?

Id: [0x00241068]
How am I ever to write about the world if I haven't seen it? I'm in.

Id: [0x0024106C]
The chance to write about all your adventures firsthand? I'm in.

Id: [0x00241070]
This is just the opportunity I've been waiting for to travel the Aegean. And with you, no less!

Id: [0x00241077]
I've always thought my hands were meant for painting and sculpting, but maybe it's time I use them for rowing. I'm in.

Id: [0x0024107B]
In order to paint the world, an artist must first see the world. When do we see set sail?

Id: [0x0024107F]
To feel Poseidon's mighty waves beneath my feet? It's always been a dream of mine. I'll join you.

Id: [0x00241089]
I never saw myself as a sailor, but perhaps this is a good opportunity to travel with my wares. I'll join you.

Id: [0x0024108D]
I've longed for adventure my whole life, <i>misthios</i>. This is just the opportunity I've been waiting for.

Id: [0x00241091]
After everything you've done for me, I'd be honored to join your crew.

Id: [0x00241098]
I always thought another life awaited me somewhere. Maybe this is how I find it. I'm in.

Id: [0x0024109C]
When do we set sail, commander?

Id: [0x002410A0]
After all you've done? I'll earn my sea legs in no time.

Id: [0x002410A7]
If you think you can use me, I'll join you.

Id: [0x002410AB]
You're looking for a midwife to join you crew? I've never seen myself as a sailor but... I'm willing to try.

Id: [0x002410AF]
How could I turn down the chance to travel the Aegean with you?

Id: [0x002410B9]
You know, I've always wanted adventure. Maybe this is my chance. [beat]I'm in.

Id: [0x002410BD]
After all you've done, there's no one I'd rather sail with.

Id: [0x002410C1]
Life on the open sea with you? I'm in.

Id: [0x002410C8]
Wherever you're headed can't be worse than this. I'll join you.

Id: [0x002410CC]
I'll earn my sea legs in no time, friend.

Id: [0x002410D0]
I always longed for adventure, but it seemed like a different life was in store for me. [beat] I'm in.

Id: [0x002410D7]
After all you've done? You've got yourself a sailor, friend.

Id: [0x002410DB]
Must be a life out there that's better than this. I'm in.

Id: [0x002410DF]
When do we set sail, friend?

Id: [0x002410E3]
Almost there.

Id: [0x002410E7]
These bandits must be relying on their cave to stay hidden. So noisy.

Id: [0x002410EB]
So, this is the conch? It's heavy. I can see why Xenia wants it.

Id: [0x002410EC]
I'd rather not swim through that tunnel again. There's a breeze in here. Must be another way out.

Id: [0x002410F1]
Goddess of War and Wisdom. Does it please you, I wonder, to watch your city on the verge of battle?

Id: [0x00241227]
With this war, no one wants to fund the sciences. Everyone's buying weapons, or stockpiling food, or bribing the soldiers not to bother them. There's no drachmae for my research. I need this war to stop. At least, here.

Id: [0x0024123A]
<i>Misthios</i>! Over here, I need to talk to you!

Id: [0x0024123B]
The Eagle Bearer?

Id: [0x00241241]
Who?

Id: [0x00241242]
The Dagger.

Id: [0x00241257]
Oh, I could tell you many things about Agapios...

Id: [0x00241268]
Why doesn't Barnabas think something is wrong with his nephew?

Id: [0x00241269]
It's just... Neleus was a legendary nuisance growing up. He lied. He cheated. He brawled and broke things.

Id: [0x0024126A]
Some of us grow out of that.

Id: [0x0024126B]
Well, now Neleus is a serious athlete, training to be an Olympic champion. And what's more, he's <i>family</i> to Barnabas.

Id: [0x0024126C]
That <i>is</i> important.

Id: [0x0024128A]
This better not be another of Neleus's pranks.

Id: [0x0024128B]
He can't be as bad as you're making him sound.

Id: [0x0024128C]
Bad?! He once stole <i>all</i> of the wine meant for a festival to Poseidon. Barrels of it. Incredible! When we opened them, sea water poured out.

Id: [0x0024128D]
Oh. That is bad.

Id: [0x0024128E]
Ah! And it gets worse. He stumbled out into the middle of the festival, as drunk as a fish is wet, and declared it was a sign from Poseidon. <i>Malákas</i> Neleus.

Id: [0x00241293]
There's the quarry[2408858]. I should find the doctor Mikkos mentioned.

Id: [0x002412AE]
But we can kick you. Don't come here again!

Id: [0x002412B2]
Follow me. I know a secret way out. [beat]It feels like every 2 weeks they're locking me up in here.

Id: [0x002412C2]
Go away! You're not the Doctor!

Id: [0x002412CA]
No, we need the Doctor...

Id: [0x002412D0]
Even though you're a slave, your life is still your own. You should've just asked your master to stay.

Id: [0x002412D3]
I don't know anything. Don't ask me anything.

Id: [0x002412D5]
Please accept my humblest apologies, master. I will never do it again.

Id: [0x002412D7]
All is forgiven. It worked out the way it was supposed to.

Id: [0x002412D9]
You should respect your master's wishes. Maybe he sees something in you that you don't see yourself.

Id: [0x002412DB]
Is that true? You think I'm ready to be on my own?

Id: [0x002412DC]
Yes. While your body and mind are still able, you should go. Start your own life.

Id: [0x002412DE]
Sorry, words are... tough. My memory, my mind, is a fog... most days. Soon, I might become like him, if the Doctor doesn't return [beat]soon.

Id: [0x002412E1]
Thank you, master. I will.

Id: [0x002412EB]
I remember...

Id: [0x002412F0]
I'm tired...

Id: [0x002412FD]
But without the Doctor making the... medicine, it's i... impor... impar... Hard for us to get better on our own.

Id: [0x002412FE]
Bless my darlings! How are they? I knew they wouldn't forget me!

Id: [0x002412FF]
You're referring to the workers at the quarry.

Id: [0x00241300]
No, no, my pets are not animals! They speak, although a little slowly.

Id: [0x00241301]
I care for them, feed them my medicine. And in turn, they help me with my research.

Id: [0x00241305]
You look strong. Yes, yes.

Id: [0x00241306]
I can never have enough pets. You could join my family? It'll be a significant contribution to my research!

Id: [0x0024130A]
I hope Agapios hasn't done something stupid...

Id: [0x00241310]
The Dagger won't go down without a fight.

Id: [0x00241315]
The temple's[2386631] off limits.

Id: [0x00241316]
But I promised my brother I'd -

Id: [0x00241317]
Leave <i>now</i>, before my very pleasant mood changes.

Id: [0x0024131A]
I won't be your test subject.

Id: [0x0024131C]
How about post-mortem arrangements?

Id: [0x0024131D]
No.

Id: [0x00241321]
It's the <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024132B]
I knew you'd be interested! Welcome to the family. Don't fret, my pet, I'll take good care of you. We'll have plenty of medicine to go around!

Id: [0x00241331]
Tell me about this medicine.

Id: [0x00241332]
A great loss for research advancement. The medicine I make is quite delicious, you know.

Id: [0x00241335]
Ah, the medicine. I feed it to my pets when my special tonic produces... side effects. Sometimes, it's too strong.

Id: [0x0024137F]
It doesn't matter now. Neleus is gone. Penthos will have to guide me through my grief.

Id: [0x0024139D]
Your blade, <i>misthios</i>. The spear.

Id: [0x0024139F]
Here.

Id: [0x002413A4]
No, you may not.

Id: [0x002413A8]
Incredible. Old. But still in killing shape.

Id: [0x002413A9]
Yes, it stabs well enough.

Id: [0x002413AA]
It reminds me of long ago. Of the Persians.

Id: [0x002413B9]
This spear has killed many Persians.

Id: [0x002413BA]
As have I. On the battlefield. And in the arena.

Id: [0x002413BD]
Then you are useless to me. I should end your life and misdeeds here.

Id: [0x002413BF]
I need the medicine for someone I know. He's afflicted with the consequences of your tonic.

Id: [0x002413D2]
Finally. I thought they would never leave.

Id: [0x002413D4]
You've done a warrior's job in the arena. Keep it up.

Id: [0x002413D5]
Thank you.

Id: [0x002413DC]
For you, Roxana, I can make time.

Id: [0x002413DE]
But, my pet, why do you want it?

Id: [0x002413DF]
I need it for someone I know.

Id: [0x002413E0]
Side effects like forgotten memories?

Id: [0x002413E1]
Ah... yes, you know it. My pets... it's my fault, yes, yes.

Id: [0x002413E3]
I'll think about it.

Id: [0x002413E5]
This blade, it's used for sacrifices in the name of Achilles. The Dagger must be devoted to him. Find the right temple of Achilles, and you'll find The Dagger. But which is the right temple?

Id: [0x002413E9]
Better make sure the woman's OK.

Id: [0x00241418]
Pleased to make your acquaintance. I'm Eppie. Well, Epizelos, but my friends call me Eppie. Not that I have "friends," necessarily.

Id: [0x00241419]
I'm Kassandra.

Id: [0x0024141A]
Charmed! You have the look of someone used to being out in the world.

Id: [0x00241420]
You have the look of someone who, um... spends lots of time reading.

Id: [0x00241421]
I don't look like much, it's true. But when discovery knocks, what other choice is there?

Id: [0x00241423]
You look like you shouldn't be outside on your own. At all.

Id: [0x00241424]
It can't be helped. I've been overcome with adventure.

Id: [0x00241446]
I told you <i>mater</i>, this is for your protection!

Id: [0x00241448]
He just got back from Delphi. Spoke with the Oracle. Been out of his mind ever since.

Id: [0x0024144D]
Oracles and prophecies do more harm than good. You should listen to your gut.

Id: [0x00241451]
Well, the Oracle does speak on behalf of the gods. If she says <i>mater</i> will bleed and <i>pater</i> will scream, then it's wise you've locked yourself up.

Id: [0x00241452]
You see! The <i>misthios</i> agrees with me.

Id: [0x00241453]
Here we go.

Id: [0x00241455]
You could save my parents from my vicious wrath.

Id: [0x00241459]
No match for a Spartan!

Id: [0x0024145D]
No. It isn't.

Id: [0x0024145E]
The knowledge is mine. <i>Mine</i>.

Id: [0x00241462]
Give up the staff.

Id: [0x00241463]
This is my chance to make things right.

Id: [0x00241469]
I will not let you have it.

Id: [0x0024146A]
I don't want it! I want it <i>destroyed</i>!

Id: [0x0024146B]
Liar!

Id: [0x0024146D]
All right, Supideo. I'll get these weapons for you, for a price.

Id: [0x0024146E]
Of course! My parents will gladly pay you for your troubles.

Id: [0x00241473]
<i>Misthios</i>! At last! Did you find the shield?

Id: [0x00241489]
Hurry! Kill these snakes before it's too late!

Id: [0x0024148E]
Help me! If you leave, these snakes will kill me!

Id: [0x0024149F]
Enough!

Id: [0x002414A5]
Get me out of here!

Id: [0x002414AA]
Aphrodite on earth! Umm... er... My name's Kosta, at your service.

Id: [0x002414AB]
I'm looking for a sword. Belongs to Supideo.

Id: [0x002414AC]
Ah, Supideo. Love that boy. Bit on the thin side if you ask me. His parents feed him nothing!

Id: [0x002414C1]
Bring me Aphrodite's flowers, and I'll give you what you want.

Id: [0x002414C5]
All you Cultists will die here!

Id: [0x002414C9]
Can't even go flower picking without some beast trying to kill me. But yes, I have them.

Id: [0x002414CD]
Gorgeous <i>misthios</i>! You take my breath away! Did you bring the flowers?

Id: [0x002414D1]
Enough talking. Eat your plants.

Id: [0x002414DD]
I need to rid Athens of this snake seller.

Id: [0x002414E0]
I'm only here for the sword. I did what you asked. Now hand it over.

Id: [0x002414E1]
You break my heart, <i>misthios</i>! But I'll make good use of these flowers. Here's the sword. As promised.

Id: [0x002414E4]
That was... incredible!

Id: [0x002414E5]
Thank Aphrodite.

Id: [0x002414E6]
[&laughs]Thank all the gods! Here. As promised.

Id: [0x002414F0]
Pathetic! You were supposed to be better than this. Bigger than this.

Id: [0x002414F1]
I will be whatever I want to be.

Id: [0x002414F2]
A <i>misthios</i>? A common thug? You are an embarrassment to yourself, and to me.

Id: [0x002414F7]
Hmm. I could easily describe you and your pirates the same way.

Id: [0x002414F8]
You want to know how we differ? Take a look around you. I have an island. Them? They have a hole in the ground.

Id: [0x002414F9]
I see.

Id: [0x002414FE]
By the gods... Who built all this?

Id: [0x00241504]
How does a place like this exist?

Id: [0x0024150A]
How could I even explain this to someone like Markos?

Id: [0x00241510]
I hope this oracle gives better news than the one in Sparta.

Id: [0x00241517]
So these markings are an ancient language?

Id: [0x00241518]
<i>Mycenaean</i>. There are languages even older than that, which have been lost. When this died out, sadly, we fell into a dark age.

Id: [0x00241525]
Your parents will have to defend themselves without the sword and shield for now.

Id: [0x0024152B]
The gods think me unworthy.

Id: [0x0024152E]
Leave me alone.

Id: [0x00241547]
The gods mock me, and you do too.

Id: [0x0024155E]
Look out!

Id: [0x00241564]
Help!

Id: [0x0024157F]
The forceps should be in there. Once I deliver these, we can get back to Hippokrates.

Id: [0x00241581]
I need you to kill more Spartan commanders.

Id: [0x00241582]
And bring you their seals. Of course.

Id: [0x00241584]
I don't understand.

Id: [0x00241587]
Why not me? It isn't fair.

Id: [0x0024158B]
Who were they? And why were they looking for the hetaerae?

Id: [0x0024158F]
CIVILIAN

Id: [0x00241593]
By Zeus, these Kephallonian bandits are no joke!

Id: [0x002415A1]
Good thing you're on my side! They really seem to fear you.

Id: [0x002415A5]
Probably, but they haven't caught me yet.

Id: [0x002415A6]
Interested in more work?

Id: [0x002415AD]
Taking a life, people do that every day. Am I a coward?

Id: [0x002415B3]
I'm surprised Apollo himself didn't strike her down long ago.

Id: [0x002415B5]
Of course. What do you need?

Id: [0x002415B7]
I have other work to do first. Maybe later.

Id: [0x002415B9]
Get a little closer, and I will.

Id: [0x002415BA]
If the Cyclops wants to teach me, tell him to come here himself.

Id: [0x002415C1]
Kassandra! It's me! [beat]Kassandra!

Id: [0x002415CB]
She's your grandmother, and you're no killer. You should give this more thought.

Id: [0x002415CE]
You're no killer. I am. If she's done the harm you've said she has, then it sounds like you need my services.

Id: [0x002415D2]
Remember that. When I make a decision, nothing will stop me from carrying it out. Don't antagonize me.

Id: [0x002415D3]
I sincerely hope you're as strong as you say. It will make the songs they write about this day that much more epic.

Id: [0x002415D4]
She's my responsibility. I don't want her to suffer. That's why I asked you for mandrake. It's a painkiller.

Id: [0x002415DF]
I have other business to take care of first.

Id: [0x002415E0]
Let's go find Praxithea.

Id: [0x002415E4]
Thanks Kassandra. You said the farm was to the west. I'll meet you there.

Id: [0x002415E9]
Hate to break it to you, but your brother was killed.

Id: [0x002415EC]
<i>Killed? </i>Get out of my sight before I hire those bandits to slit <i>your</i> throat.

Id: [0x002415ED]
Time to go.

Id: [0x002415F3]
I hope this heart is enough. If they want the whole bull, they can come get it themselves.

Id: [0x002415F8]
Ugh. Not the best feeling.

Id: [0x002415FE]
Time to dust yourself off and focus.

Id: [0x002415FF]
You're right.

Id: [0x00241643]
I can't let Chrysis walk free. I'll kill that <i>malákas</i>.

Id: [0x00241659]
No! Well, yes and no. I dig through dirt, too.

Id: [0x0024165A]
That's what farmers do.

Id: [0x00241671]
They won't trouble you again, but you won't earn the love and respect of the people this way.

Id: [0x00241672]
True, but then we didn't kill civilians, did we, misthios?

Id: [0x00241673]
They didn't do this alone, you might end up with more trouble than you imagined.

Id: [0x00241674]
If so, then I will offer you more drachmae. Isn't that how it works?

Id: [0x00241675]
Fuck you!

Id: [0x00241676]
[&laughs]Don't worry, I'll find you if we need you.

Id: [0x00241678]
MERCENARY

Id: [0x00241684]
I need to get out of here. I should head back to Barnabas.

Id: [0x0024168B]
This is a nice ship.

Id: [0x0024168C]
You don't have to do that.

Id: [0x0024168D]
Do what?

Id: [0x0024168E]
Fill the silence.

Id: [0x0024168F]
Oh! I wasn't trying to do that at all. I simply don't find myself traveling the seas very often.

Id: [0x00241690]
It can be freeing.

Id: [0x00241691]
Yes, "freeing" seems to be an accurate word. Although I've begun to feel a bit sick...

Id: [0x00241692]
Lean over the side if you need to, otherwise you're cleaning it up.

Id: [0x00241699]
Remember, more orichalcum equals more goodies.

Id: [0x002416AB]
I hope leaving Athens was the right thing to do.

Id: [0x002416AC]
Of course it was. You'll be safe this way.

Id: [0x002416AD]
Will I?

Id: [0x002416AE]
Safer than you were, at least. If the Cult can't find you, they can't kill you. It's simple.

Id: [0x002416AF]
So long as they don't find me, yes. But who knows where they are... who they are... we could be heading somewhere even more dangerous.

Id: [0x002416B0]
Maybe. But this is your best chance.

Id: [0x002416B2]
Book your tour now to avoid the disappointment of staring up at your own headless body while the Minotaur laughs at you - even he thinks the tour's great value for drachmae!

Id: [0x002416B3]
Actually, I already have them. I may have killed a few more Spartan commanders than you'd mentioned.

Id: [0x002416B4]
An overachiever. Maybe you are as good as they say. Would you be interested in more work?

Id: [0x002416C6]
Take the Minotaur tour to avoid bringing shame and dishonor to your parents. [as Husband Talking to Wife]"Wife, I heard our child went off to slay the Minotaur! Have they returned victoriously yet?"

Id: [0x002416C7]
[as Wife Talking to Husband]"No Husband, they didn't take a handsome young man's very reasonably priced tour and were tragically killed. We're laughing stocks at the agora. We never should've had kids."

Id: [0x00241713]
Is this what you want your parents to say, hero? Is it? No?! Then sign up now for my Minotaur Tour now!

Id: [0x00241714]
Are you sure you want your soldiers this intoxicated while in the field?

Id: [0x00241715]
I must have misjudged you. Are you not also a Spartan? The only thing we're better at than fighting is drinking.

Id: [0x00241716]
I see your point.

Id: [0x00241753]
Could be one of Stentor's scouts. Looks like he's run into some problems.

Id: [0x0024175E]
That's the Athenian leader. He must die if I'm to meet my pater.

Id: [0x00241763]
That's the Athenian leader. His bodyguard will need dealing with.

Id: [0x00241768]
Now the Athenian leader is dead, I should return to Stentor.

Id: [0x0024176E]
Don't keep the Wolf waiting.

Id: [0x00241776]
The Wolf awaits you.

Id: [0x00241778]
You fought well today - for a mercenary.

Id: [0x0024177E]
The Fates have delivered you onto my path, and thus we travel together.

Id: [0x0024177F]
The Fates have been known to have a sense of humor.

Id: [0x00241780]
Happening upon you, hero, is fortuitous.

Id: [0x00241785]
I've dedicated my life to it. It's so much more than treasure to be looted.

Id: [0x00241786]
Is it though?

Id: [0x00241787]
It's who we are! Knowing where we come from tells us where we are headed.

Id: [0x00241788]
You educated people and your riddles.

Id: [0x00241789]
Some people don't care about the past. They only want to steal something that will make them a few drachmae. Imagine that.

Id: [0x0024178A]
Hard to believe.

Id: [0x0024178B]
My peers are no more than treasure hunters and art dealers.

Id: [0x0024178C]
Well. You did mention precious jewels.

Id: [0x0024178F]
These ruins and relics are notoriously hard to find. I found this one through clever searching and deduction.

Id: [0x00241790]
Tell me more about it.

Id: [0x00241791]
Mycenaeans held specific rituals. Some tales speak of objects made by the gods.

Id: [0x00241792]
Yes. The gods like to play their hand on occasion.

Id: [0x00241795]
Think of this, <i>misthios</i>! How would you like to have had the gods help you in battle?

Id: [0x00241796]
A good warrior doesn't need any help from the gods or anyone else.

Id: [0x00241797]
True. True. But think of what we might find there.

Id: [0x00241798]
You think we'll find something with this power?

Id: [0x00241799]
See? Now are you interested?

Id: [0x0024179A]
I certainly am.

Id: [0x002417B1]
There. The Athenian treasure.

Id: [0x002417B6]
I should get the treasure and leave quietly.

Id: [0x002417BB]
The Athenian soldiers won't be so eager to fight when they don't get paid.

Id: [0x002417C0]
Those supplies look valuable. I should destroy them.

Id: [0x002417C5]
That should be enough destroyed supplies. If Athenian soldiers are starving, they might lose their hunger for war.

Id: [0x002417CA]
Just a few more, and the Athenian soldiers will be going hungry.

Id: [0x002417CF]
That's one less Athenian to worry about.

Id: [0x002417D6]
You do fine work, mercenary. Take this as thanks.

Id: [0x002417DA]
Excellent work, my friend. Please, take this.

Id: [0x002417DE]
Job well done, my friend. I believe this is yours.

Id: [0x002417E2]
You kept up your end of the deal. Now it's time I hold up mine. Take this.

Id: [0x002417E6]
Nicely done, my friend. Please, take this as thanks.

Id: [0x002417EB]
I think the Athenian army would miss those men.

Id: [0x002417F0]
That should thin the ranks of the Athenian elites enough.

Id: [0x002417FF]
The tree of Herakles... I'm not sure if it's loved more for its legend or its olives. Now, where's that priest?

Id: [0x00241803]
Perhaps when you read it...

Id: [0x00241808]
Yes, yes! Hmm... Only those who possess inner vision, a gift of the primordial gods, will be deemed worthy to wield power of the Great <i>Dipsioi</i>. [beat]<i>Dipsioi</i>?

Id: [0x0024180E]
What did you expect me to do? All that talk about killing... A solution showed up, so I took it.

Id: [0x00241813]
That wasn't the way it was supposed to happen. She's my responsibility, not yours.

Id: [0x00241817]
For a Spartan.

Id: [0x00241818]
Yes, as you say. It seems our fleet is under attack, and I need to redirect the troops to help. I will ask you to take on the Spartan command again.

Id: [0x0024181C]
Your actions do seem to support Athens. So then are you prepared for a final push against the Spartan command?

Id: [0x00241829]
[beat]Trust me, I know my Minotaurs - I've been in this business 27 years. Just between you and me, I'm kinda hoping my boy, Arsenios Jr., takes over some day. Good kid, goooood kid.

Id: [0x0024183D]
If only I could sell more Minotaur Hoof Elixir, we might be able to afford a physician...!

Id: [0x00241852]
But look at me - I'm no Minotaur slayer. [beat]I got robbed by a tiny tour guide my first day here!

Id: [0x00241853]
[beat]Best steal the Pephka leader's shiniest armor. Oh, and I'll need a weapon! Something I can say I pried from the Minotaur's cold dead hands! [beat, to himself][&hmm]Cold dead hooves?

Id: [0x00241858]
[beat]Riiiight now! Here we go! My feet are kinda over the edge! My big toes are no longer safe - only air is beneath them! Everyone stand back, or the rest of my feet are sure to follow!

Id: [0x00241860]
Eros? Please, his ears are stuffed full with the prattling of these women.

Id: [0x00241863]
Yes, yes, my pets!

Id: [0x00241864]
I have a real bond with my pets.

Id: [0x00241865]
Yet, you still feed them the tonic.

Id: [0x00241866]
I had no choice! I was forced to do it! But I will right my wrongs. I always right my wrongs, yes, yes.

Id: [0x00241870]
The people who captured you, who were they?

Id: [0x00241871]
OK then... Still, I can tell it's a special weapon.

Id: [0x00241876]
It was that fellow with the eyepatch! He was taking orders from this other bald man... They wanted my tonic and forced me to create more.

Id: [0x00241878]
No one can keep me away from my pets, yes, yes!

Id: [0x0024187D]
But don't you worry, my pet. I won't let them get to you! I'll protect you and your siblings.

Id: [0x00241884]
Neritos. Brother, remember when we were young, when we'd run through the streets of Chalkis?

Id: [0x00241889]
I need the medicine you mentioned. Give it to me.

Id: [0x0024188F]
The Robin and the Kingfisher...

Id: [0x00241891]
But don't fret, my sweet darling!

Id: [0x00241892]
You won't be taking this tonic - you can help me in <i>other</i> ways.

Id: [0x00241893]
Ah but, like I said, the side effects can be rather dire... It was perhaps a miscalculation on my part. My poor pets.

Id: [0x00241896]
There are others afflicted by my tonic? It cannot be!

Id: [0x00241897]
Just give me the medicine.

Id: [0x0024189B]
I'm afraid it'll take time to make. Yes, yes.

Id: [0x002418A2]
You fought in the Persian wars?

Id: [0x002418A5]
<i>Maláka</i>.

Id: [0x002418A6]
I had no choice! They threatened to kill my pets!

Id: [0x002418A7]
First, get rid of those <i>malákes</i> who kept me away from my pets! They're at the fortress[2433093] just down the road.

Id: [0x002418B5]
What was the arena like in your time?

Id: [0x002418B8]
I survived.

Id: [0x002418B9]
What? Whatever for? I am not obliged to. I will do no such thing, no, no!

Id: [0x002418BA]
I have to go.

Id: [0x002418BC]
No, no! No violence needed! I'll do as you say!

Id: [0x002418BD]
What? It cannot be!

Id: [0x002418BE]
You wouldn't forsake a "<i>pet</i>," would you?

Id: [0x002418C0]
I cannot abandon my pets.

Id: [0x002418C4]
Eyes peeled, the Kingfisher won't come out until the coast is clear.

Id: [0x002418C6]
Misthios! No, no, you deserve a more appropriate name... The Hero of Euboea! Thanks to you, we finally have The Dagger on the back foot! Please, help us end this.

Id: [0x002418CF]
<i>Misthios</i>! Over here, quick!

Id: [0x002418F2]
<i>Misthios! </i>You came!

Id: [0x002418F6]
Agapios and the Kingfisher are still up at the Temple. We can't get past the Dagger's forces. Please, we need your help.

Id: [0x002418FC]
This isn't my mess to clean.

Id: [0x002418FD]
You're leaving?! But... but you're the Hero of Euboea...!

Id: [0x0024190D]
Hurry, misthios! Agapios and his brother are at the temple[2386631] on the hill. Strike now! End the Dagger!

Id: [0x00241952]
Talk to the man and posture if you must.

Id: [0x00241953]
I don't want to set a horrible example for the children.

Id: [0x00241954]
Don't worry about it. I'll <i>deal</i> with it.

Id: [0x00241958]
Your friend looks hurt.

Id: [0x00241959]
He is very... sick. Mind fog took... took over. We need the Doctor.

Id: [0x0024195C]
I was told I would find the Doctor here.

Id: [0x0024195F]
Talk to the man instead! Make him honor his word to pay us.

Id: [0x00241960]
I'm a <i>misthios, </i>it's a dangerous line of work.

Id: [0x00241961]
Not like this. Not like The Dagger.

Id: [0x00241964]
But we aren't savages.

Id: [0x0024196C]
He was just another man doing right by his family. Too bad he mixed with the wrong people.

Id: [0x00241975]
Every. Single. One.

Id: [0x00241976]
Malákas liar!

Id: [0x00241977]
You've led them right to me...

Id: [0x00241990]
A <i>misthios</i>? What do you want?

Id: [0x00241995]
They won't bother the Doctor again.

Id: [0x0024199E]
Your head off your shoulders.

Id: [0x0024199F]
Guards! To me, at once!

Id: [0x002419A6]
I'm just here to talk.

Id: [0x002419A7]
Did the theater couple send you? I already told them to leave me alone. Or else -

Id: [0x002419A8]
Or else <i>what? </i>You'd hurt the children that live there?

Id: [0x002419A9]
As unfortunate as that is, I would.

Id: [0x002419AA]
For my family, I'd do anything!

Id: [0x002419AB]
Guards! We've an intruder!

Id: [0x00241A08]
A warrior in the arena doesn't have many privileges outside those of pleasure, fame, and glory. Tell me, <i>misthios.</i> Do you have anyone close to you? Friends? Family? Lovers?

Id: [0x00241A09]
Cursed Cult guards, <i>misthios</i>, look what they've done. They've killed them. My poor pets slaughtered like animals.

Id: [0x00241A0A]
Save your strength. You may still survive this.

Id: [0x00241A0B]
I'm a physician, misthios. I know when a patient is dying. Here, the antidote I promised. I always right my wrongs. Yes, yes.

Id: [0x00241A0D]
I'll give this to Neleus.

Id: [0x00241A0E]
It's his best hope. But don't expect a miracle.

Id: [0x00241A0F]
I won't leave you like this.

Id: [0x00241A10]
You can kill me and end my misery once and for all. Please, it's all I ask.

Id: [0x00241A13]
I have people in my life. People that are important to me. Do you have that as well?

Id: [0x00241A14]
You seem lonely, old man. Don't <i>you</i> have anybody close to you?

Id: [0x00241A17]
[&ah]My daughter's very important to me.

Id: [0x00241A18]
I don't long for the company of others. A <i>misthios</i> works best unencumbered.

Id: [0x00241A1F]
I'll let them go -

Id: [0x00241A23]
Release them this instant.

Id: [0x00241A24]
<i>After</i> I've made a few cuts.

Id: [0x00241A29]
<i>Misthios</i>! I've sent the children away. Make sure this Dagger <i>maláka</i> doesn't get to -

Id: [0x00241A2B]
Shut up! We'll find every last one of your precious kids. They'll fetch a good price.

Id: [0x00241A34]
We can discuss this -

Id: [0x00241A35]
You are in <i>no</i> position to discuss anything. After I've made a few cuts, they'll be free to go.

Id: [0x00241A3E]
Follow me. I know their secret exit. Up here!

Id: [0x00241A40]
The Dagger doesn't appreciate your... intrusions into our affairs.

Id: [0x00241A41]
<i>Maláka.</i>

Id: [0x00241A42]
Touch them and you'll touch nothing else.

Id: [0x00241A43]
Then you <i>malákes</i> should get out of my way.

Id: [0x00241A48]
Oh! How tough! How <i>brave.</i>

Id: [0x00241A49]
Brave like when you freed that slave! Remember her? The little spy girl?

Id: [0x00241A4B]
If you laid a finger on her -

Id: [0x00241A4E]
Curse you.

Id: [0x00241A52]
I'm a man that likes a little drama. So let's make this interesting.

Id: [0x00241A53]
You, <i>misthios</i>, seem to have a flair for the dramatic, and we are in a theater after all.

Id: [0x00241A54]
So let's have you decide how this play will... play out.[&laughs][laughs][/&laughs]

Id: [0x00241A59]
But just one!

Id: [0x00241A5A]
So, meddling<i> misthios</i>. Tell us, who should live?

Id: [0x00241A5E]
Save Idyia, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00241A5F]
Wha - no!

Id: [0x00241A60]
Save Prexileos, <i>misthios</i>. The kids can't do without him.

Id: [0x00241A61]
No, save Idyia! Please! You'll be saving more than -

Id: [0x00241A63]
All right, time's up. Pick an ending to our little play, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00241A65]
Easy, that's you.

Id: [0x00241A66]
Try, and these two will have their throats slit before you even reach me.

Id: [0x00241A67]
But, like I was saying. <i>Someone's</i> got to die.

Id: [0x00241A70]
I'll save them both! But you will die, Dagger scum.

Id: [0x00241A71]
[&breath]Wrong answer.

Id: [0x00241A77]
You've doomed yourselves!

Id: [0x00241A78]
Why'd you have to be so boring?! This could've been so much more fun. Kill the misthios!

Id: [0x00241A7B]
Idyia. Let her live.

Id: [0x00241A7E]
No! What have you done?!

Id: [0x00241A7F]
No! Prexileos? Prexileos, answer me!

Id: [0x00241A88]
Release Prexileos.

Id: [0x00241A8B]
No! What have you done?!

Id: [0x00241A8C]
No, no, no, no, no. Idyia, my love...

Id: [0x00241A99]
If you want more orichalcum, misthios, check the message board.

Id: [0x00241A9E]
I always have work for an honest <i>misthios</i>. Check the board in town.

Id: [0x00241AA3]
Look far and wide upon your travels, <i>misthios</i>. You never know where you'll find rare and valuable orichalcum.

Id: [0x00241AA8]
If you want more orichalcum, <i>misthios</i>, check the board.

Id: [0x00241AAA]
Good for you.

Id: [0x00241AAF]
Mycenaeans were known for their elaborate grave sites full of precious things.

Id: [0x00241AB0]
How precious?

Id: [0x00241ABB]
That should do it. I should let Perikles's contact know.

Id: [0x00241AC1]
The Spartans will get their supplies back, which will help against the Athenians. That's all that matters.

Id: [0x00241AC6]
Thank the gods they didn't try to fight. I wasn't in the mood to kill starving civilians today.

Id: [0x00241ACB]
The Spartans are finishing off the Athenians who swam to shore. Easiest kill they could hope for.

Id: [0x00241AD0]
I'd like to see you try.

Id: [0x00241AD4]
So this is the "secret" chamber... They're not ones for subtlety, are they?

Id: [0x00241AD7]
Are these people harassing you?

Id: [0x00241AD8]
Harassing him? We're his parents!

Id: [0x00241AD9]
Protection from what, exactly?

Id: [0x00241ADA]
She revealed my prophecy. My mind has never been more clear.

Id: [0x00241ADC]
She said I would do unspeakable things to my parents. That <i>mater's</i> blood would stain the earth. And <i>pater</i> will scream to the gods in agony.

Id: [0x00241AE0]
OK, I can either kill them one by one or flood them with cold water.

Id: [0x00241AEF]
It shouldn't be long now. No, it <i>won't</i> be, I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x00241AF0]
Then they'll help?

Id: [0x00241AF1]
Everyone has something they want. My job is to figure out how much they'll give for that something.

Id: [0x00241AF3]
Then Korinth will be ours again.

Id: [0x00241AF4]
Very soon, it will return to its rightful hands.

Id: [0x00241AF5]
You're right.

Id: [0x00241AF8]
So, does that bird follow you everywhere?

Id: [0x00241AF9]
Ikaros? Yes, he likes to keep an eye on me. Are you jealous?

Id: [0x00241AFF]
A single fire arrow should do the trick.

Id: [0x00241B04]
I can burn these crates with a fire arrow.

Id: [0x00241B09]
Good thing there are so many places to light my arrows on fire.

Id: [0x00241B37]
Yes! You're right. The stele needs to be assembled. Come!

Id: [0x00241B39]
What do you make of that?

Id: [0x00241B3E]
Why are there so many snakes?

Id: [0x00241B40]
If you don't mind being watched, I don't either.

Id: [0x00241B44]
Did Zeus give you any special powers? You know, Achilles got invulnerability, Herakles the strength of a god...

Id: [0x00241B45]
If you know the old stories, you know what Zeus is especially good at.

Id: [0x00241B46]
If you have that kind of talent, just call me Pandora.

Id: [0x00241B4B]
Well, that wasn't so bad, was it?

Id: [0x00241B51]
I thought they were exaggerating when they said people from all around came to see Hippokrates.

Id: [0x00241B56]
So many sick people... Can one man help all of them?

Id: [0x00241B60]
I can't believe I have family again.

Id: [0x00241B61]
The gods work in mysterious ways! You never know what they have planned.

Id: [0x00241B63]
It'll never be the same. [beat]I thought it could, but it'll take some work.

Id: [0x00241B64]
It's impossible to see through the gods' eyes - they have a plan, you know. If we could, then we'd know <i>just</i> what to do.

Id: [0x00241B6F]
I don't think the gods can take credit for this one, Barnabas.

Id: [0x00241B70]
<i>Someone's</i> kept their eye on me.

Id: [0x00241B71]
You're special. Look at the life they've blessed you with! Not so bad, if you think of it all.

Id: [0x00241B8C]
An urn is only as strong as its potter, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00241B8D]
Urns are pretty easy to break.

Id: [0x00241B8F]
That's optimistic, considering.

Id: [0x00241B91]
Come one, come all! Behold the incredible things Sargon has to offer you.

Id: [0x00241B92]
My goods come from all corners of the Greek world [beat]and beyond!

Id: [0x00241B93]
Step forward, my friend. Sargon guarantees you've never seen anything like the wares he has to offer.

Id: [0x00241B94]
I have plundered Pandora's box itself to bring you these rare and mythical objects.

Id: [0x00241B95]
Did you think I was joking?

Id: [0x00241B96]
Your funeral.

Id: [0x00241B98]
Sorry, I meant you two.

Id: [0x00241B9C]
I'll need to bring back proof of the commander's death.

Id: [0x00241BA6]
Kill the commander and bring back proof. Simple.

Id: [0x00241BA8]
Just remember. No matter who surrounds you, I'll be there! [beat]And the others are waiting for us on the ship.

Id: [0x00241BA9]
Right behind you.

Id: [0x00241BAC]
Come, friend. Sargon has all manner of objects that a mercenary like you will find enticing.

Id: [0x00241BB9]
This metal. It looks old. I wonder if anyone would be interested in this.

Id: [0x00241BBE]
None of us have ever disappeared like this before. Some are worried they'll be taken next.

Id: [0x00241BC3]
Korinth may have a bad reputation, but it wasn't always that way. We used to be safe.

Id: [0x00241BC4]
Until the Monger...

Id: [0x00241BC5]
We're not sure why he came here, but Korinth is worse off because of him.

Id: [0x00241BC8]
Someone's got to <i>die </i>here today.

Id: [0x00241BCE]
Ah, the <i>misthios</i> from the ostracism! Let's talk later.

Id: [0x00241BD9]
Don't do anything rash, <i>misthios!</i>

Id: [0x00241BDA]
I won't let anyone die today.

Id: [0x00241BDB]
If you don't make a choice between these two love birds, I'll kill them <i>both.</i>

Id: [0x00241BDD]
I don't think he's playing around, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00241BDE]
It's always more fun when one lover is alive to watch the other <i>bleed</i>.

Id: [0x00241BE1]
They do not worship as you and I do. I thank Demeter for all she gives us at the end of each day. But they just reap the bounty of her hard work!

Id: [0x00241BF6]
Idyia, I'm -

Id: [0x00241BF7]
I won't forgive them, <i>misthios</i>. I'll kill them. I won't stop until every one of these Dagger bastards is dead.

Id: [0x00241BF8]
Remember what you said about setting an example for your children.

Id: [0x00241C0B]
Kill them, <i>misthios</i>. Kill every last one of them on Skyros.

Id: [0x00241C11]
I'll gladly take your drachmae to kill Spartans.

Id: [0x00241C12]
And bring me their seals. I won't pay you without proof.

Id: [0x00241C13]
Have I failed you yet?

Id: [0x00241C14]
Not yet.

Id: [0x00241C16]
They will die for what they've done to you and Euboea.

Id: [0x00241C17]
Every. Last. One.

Id: [0x00241C1A]
That's asking a lot. We don't know what's going on in Skyros.

Id: [0x00241C1B]
Coward. But I'm sure Agapios will do something about the Dagger even if you won't.

Id: [0x00241C1D]
Get out of my theater.

Id: [0x00241C20]
Speak up, stranger!

Id: [0x00241C21]
You have made the wrong choice...

Id: [0x00241C22]
I made what I -

Id: [0x00241C23]
She was with child, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00241C25]
You've forfeited two lives for this useless one.

Id: [0x00241C26]
I have more important things to do than solve your problems. Maybe later.

Id: [0x00241C2A]
I'm sorry, Prexileos. But you still have your other children to worry about. Get yourself together.

Id: [0x00241C2F]
Do me a favor and dismantle the Dagger. So my children can live without fear in Euboea.

Id: [0x00241C39]
Without a doubt. I will destroy them.

Id: [0x00241C3B]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Gods be with you.

Id: [0x00241C3D]
I don't know the situation on Skyros. I can't promise you that.

Id: [0x00241C3E]
I see... Let's hope Agapios has a plan, then. Farewell, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00241C42]
Let's set aside our differences. I didn't mean to insult you.

Id: [0x00241C43]
I accept your apology. So, are you interested?

Id: [0x00241C52]
Don't let Idyia down.

Id: [0x00241C5F]
Considering I'm doing you a favor, you could be nicer about it.

Id: [0x00241C60]
I'm paying you. This is no favor. Are you interested or not?

Id: [0x00241C68]
The necklace is down there.

Id: [0x00241C7F]
The mercenary Hyrkanos is dead.

Id: [0x00241C80]
Sparta thanks you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00241C81]
What about my reward?

Id: [0x00241C82]
We never entered into a contract. This is something you did yourself... But be assured Sparta is grateful.

Id: [0x00241C83]
Great...

Id: [0x00241C89]
Prexileos... No! Wake up, wake up! You can't leave us alone.

Id: [0x00241C91]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x00241C92]
Listening to my gut. And it's telling me my parents will suffer if you don't help me.

Id: [0x00241C95]
Oh Supideo, you believe complete strangers before your own parents.

Id: [0x00241C9B]
So, she's in a huge temple on top of an even larger mountain. I wonder how she sees herself?

Id: [0x00241CA1]
Do you just like this particular spot because of Athena? Or because you admire the Parthenon?

Id: [0x00241CBC]
I should get a closer look to figure out what happened here.

Id: [0x00241CC0]
Sure, I'm up for whatever challenge you have in mind.

Id: [0x00241CC3]
Not just strangers, <i>mater</i>! My own gut tells me these things will happen. Unless...

Id: [0x00241CC5]
You! You can help me!

Id: [0x00241CD4]
This is the place. Time to burn some cargo.

Id: [0x00241CD7]
You seem thoughtful. Thinking of what happened to your grandfather?

Id: [0x00241CDB]
I'll pay more than whatever fool sent you.

Id: [0x00241CDD]
I can match your fee and more, <i>misthios</i>, if you just walk away now.

Id: [0x00241CDF]
No need to spill any blood today, <i>misthios</i>. I'm more than willing to pay you to turn a blind eye.

Id: [0x00241D11]
Quiet, <i>pater</i>! Me and the misthios are talking.

Id: [0x00241D12]
My sword and shield! Gifts from <i>mater</i> and <i>pater</i>.  We must return them to my parents so they can defend themselves from my ferocious temper.

Id: [0x00241D13]
You don't have a vicious bone in your body.

Id: [0x00241D37]
I don't have much to repay you, mercenary, but I still need your help.

Id: [0x00241D3B]
Not many would step in like you did, mercenary. Maybe you could help me again?

Id: [0x00241D47]
No. Thinking of the first battle I lost.

Id: [0x00241D48]
What happened?

Id: [0x00241D49]
I overestimated my own abilities. We were supposed to lay siege to a city, but I was impatient. I felt the need to prove myself... at the expense of my men.

Id: [0x00241D4A]
You abandoned the siege.

Id: [0x00241D4B]
Yes. I led an attack my men weren't prepared for, on Aitolia. It was pure hubris on my part, and my men paid for it. My closest friend died in the battle. Never again.

Id: [0x00241D4C]
I see why you're so determined to get the Spartans at a disadvantage.

Id: [0x00241D58]
I've already talked about him enough.

Id: [0x00241D59]
All right.

Id: [0x00241EBA]
The Cyclops. Time to have a little chat.

Id: [0x00241EC5]
What makes you think you're in trouble now?

Id: [0x00241EC9]
What's so special about a stick?

Id: [0x00241ECA]
Oh, it's so much more than that.

Id: [0x00241ECE]
That's Hippokrates's clinic.

Id: [0x00241ED0]
Get to the point.

Id: [0x00241EDC]
Ah, the <i>misthios</i> returns for more pay. What must the Spartans think of one of their own tipping the battle towards Athens?

Id: [0x00241EDD]
I don't worry about what others think.

Id: [0x00241EE2]
No loyalty then?

Id: [0x00241EE3]
I've decided that to honor Hera I won't be selling goods today. [beat]Lest she throw a fit.

Id: [0x00241EE5]
Lucky I came by.

Id: [0x00241EE6]
Ancient jewelry, ceremonial swords and daggers. So, very precious. If you escort me, I'll show you.

Id: [0x00241EE8]
The mighty Zeus himself has cursed me. I cannot sell my wares today.

Id: [0x00241EED]
In my dreams, Hades made it clear I was not to sell goods today... Or I'd be dragged screaming to the underworld.

Id: [0x00241EF6]
These priests will have answers.

Id: [0x00241EFC]
The Pythia decreed I was not to sell items today. Come back another time.

Id: [0x00241EFF]
I'm sorry, <i>misthios</i>. I drank with Dionysos last night, and my store is closed as a result.

Id: [0x00241F02]
Oh, thank Zeus. My helots, Teuta and Maron... They work the fields, but they do not respect the gods. Teach them.

Id: [0x00241F08]
Unfortunately my humble store is closed at the moment. Only the gods can know when it will open again.

Id: [0x00241F26]
Best of luck, General.

Id: [0x00241F2A]
Seek out Kosta, the village blacksmith. I brought him the sword to be sharpened not too long ago.

Id: [0x00241F2B]
And the shield?

Id: [0x00241F2C]
This will be trickier. [whispers]I'll explain when you return from the blacksmith.

Id: [0x00241F2D]
What?!

Id: [0x00241F2E]
What?!

Id: [0x00241F36]
You wrapped it around your rod?

Id: [0x00241F37]
Whatever else I can say, you've done your job well.

Id: [0x00241F38]
Such high praise.

Id: [0x00241F41]
Gods be good, I think this is the right spot.

Id: [0x00241F4D]
Perhaps Athena was smiling down upon Athens when she sent you to me. You've far surpassed my expectations.

Id: [0x00241F4E]
I always aim to do a good job.

Id: [0x00241F4F]
You have. Beyond that, you've shown an understanding of war and its price. That's a lesson some never learn.

Id: [0x00241F5D]
This must be the place.

Id: [0x00241F64]
Pan's flute! Xenia will love this.

Id: [0x00241F69]
I have in my possession a Mycenaean tablet that leads to a sacred burial site. I'm calling it the Cave of the Oracle.

Id: [0x00241F6D]
Found it. Xenia's mapmaker is right on the mark again.

Id: [0x00241F73]
That must be the tool Maron mentioned.

Id: [0x00241F78]
The golden lyre of Apollo! What Xenia won't give for this...

Id: [0x00241F9B]
Wait! Take this stele piece. See if there are markings that match it.

Id: [0x00242002]
I... didn't expect that.

Id: [0x00242003]
No one is only one thing, my West Wind.

Id: [0x00242004]
True...

Id: [0x00242005]
Enough chatter. I have another use for your tongue and your hands. Your skills are needed.

Id: [0x00242007]
Where would I get mint?

Id: [0x00242008]
The master keeps dried herbs up at the house.

Id: [0x00242014]
<i>Mater</i> once gave me mint. It tastes the way ice feels. This has to be it.

Id: [0x0024201F]
I should tell Herodotos what the Pythia told me about the Cult. Maybe he'll have some insight.

Id: [0x0024203D]
Do you know why a Spartan soldier can lose his helmet or spear without worry, but if he loses his shield, he is punished beyond all measure?

Id: [0x0024203E]
Tell me.

Id: [0x0024203F]
It is because a soldier needs his helmet and spear to defend only himself, but his shield is dearly important for the safety of his brothers and the whole battle line.

Id: [0x00242055]
What of your brother?

Id: [0x00242056]
Theoros? He's the best! He's amazing to watch in the games. He's fast and strong, and he can throw the javelin and discus farther than anyone.

Id: [0x00242057]
I'm faster than anyone my age, but Theoros is like Herakles himself!

Id: [0x00242058]
He sounds like a god made flesh.

Id: [0x00242059]
He's my hero! He even sings like Orpheus! Do you want to hear me sing? Though mother says I sing like a harpy.

Id: [0x0024205A]
No, that's OK. I'll be glad to meet him.

Id: [0x00242073]
Stay on your guard!

Id: [0x0024207A]
Huh. Well, it's a decent piece. But where's the rest of it?

Id: [0x0024207F]
There. The rotten crops can fertilize the ground for next year. [giggles]Oh, that blaze is really going.

Id: [0x00242088]
If I meditate, maybe Phidias will be here when I'm done.

Id: [0x0024208F]
I don't think I'll find anything else. I should report back.

Id: [0x00242091]
Could someone pass the waterskin?

Id: [0x00242092]
Could someone pass my head? I think I left it further down the beach.

Id: [0x00242098]
There's that "artist." Found you.

Id: [0x002420BA]
It should be much easier to travel the island now that everyone won't try to kill me on sight.

Id: [0x002420BD]
Please, I have a lot to do.

Id: [0x002420C7]
A lost shield... that is a bad omen.

Id: [0x002420CB]
What does it say?

Id: [0x002420CC]
Um... I think that says, "of the gods."

Id: [0x002420CD]
Really? To think, you were someone yelling for help not long ago.

Id: [0x002420CE]
Look at me now.

Id: [0x002420D3]
I need to see to my children. Leave.

Id: [0x00242100]
It doesn't explain why the armor was separated and hidden with a stele piece.

Id: [0x00242101]
Maybe that was part of the ritual? We need to find the other stele pieces. Are you ready?

Id: [0x0024211A]
Nikolaos warned me of snakes in the grass, but I wasn't expecting this.

Id: [0x0024211D]
There's more?

Id: [0x00242124]
There has to be a clue around here somewhere.

Id: [0x00242128]
That is a mighty weapon, fit for only the finest warrior in the Greek world.

Id: [0x00242129]
You will slay countless enemies with a weapon so fine.

Id: [0x0024212C]
No beast nor man will be able to stand before you whilst you wield that weapon.

Id: [0x0024212D]
What does that have to do with primordial gods?

Id: [0x0024212E]
I have no idea. When we have all of the stele pieces, we'll know.

Id: [0x0024212F]
Amazing! That is a weapon fit for the gods themselves.

Id: [0x00242130]
What an incredible weapon! It truly is a masterpiece of craftsmanship.

Id: [0x00242150]
Come now, <i>misthios</i>. Surely there's something I can do to change your mind?

Id: [0x00242152]
No one has to die here. There must be something I can do to convince you to walk away.

Id: [0x002421AC]
He's not the boy you remember. He's not Neritos.

Id: [0x002421B2]
You will see why we're called the Dagger, <i>misthios! </i>You! Will BLEED!

Id: [0x002421CC]
You'll die for that, Kingfisher!

Id: [0x002421CF]
The Dagger ends, now.

Id: [0x002421D5]
Idiots! I'll be back, you can't keep me away forever! I'll find a way in!

Id: [0x002421D9]
Agapios's life and the fate of Euboea are in your hands now. Go!

Id: [0x002421DB]
I didn't think you'd return... The Dagger are stronger than ever, and the Magistrate still believes my brother's behind them!

Id: [0x002421E2]
You've returned... What did you learn?

Id: [0x002421E3]
The Dagger's base is on Skyros. They seem to be planning a ritual at the Temple of Achilles -

Id: [0x002421E5]
What did you learn about my brother?! Is he alive? Is he the Kingfisher?

Id: [0x002421E7]
I was at the theater. I didn't find any leads.

Id: [0x002421E8]
<i>Then look harder! </i>There must be <i>something </i>there!

Id: [0x002421EA]
Sorry, sorry, I - [beat]please, you must find something that will clear my brother's name

Id: [0x002421EF]
I know a farmer who's had dealings with The Dagger's inner circle. If anyone's seen the Kingfisher's true face, it's him.

Id: [0x002421F0]
I should pay him a visit. Any other leads?

Id: [0x002421F1]
There's a shipwreck along Euboea's southern coast, and the theater in Chalkis City has been spreading The Dagger's lies.

Id: [0x002421F4]
I have other things to do.

Id: [0x002421F5]
But a nation needs you! I need you! Should you return, I'll be here.

Id: [0x00242207]
You seem well connected. How is that?

Id: [0x00242208]
For a slave, you mean? We're not without eyes and ears, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00242209]
We see much, and we share it, slave to slave. Leads, warnings, anything that might help us survive all the way from today... to tomorrow.

Id: [0x0024220A]
We're in a war, ships are sunk daily. Why does this ship matter?

Id: [0x0024220B]
Because this ship appears to belong to The Dagger. A slave I trust waits by a temple above the ruins in Eretria. Speak with her to learn more.

Id: [0x0024220C]
You said you know a farmer who's had dealings with The Dagger.

Id: [0x0024220D]
Maybe I could beat some information out of him...

Id: [0x0024220E]
Ha! No, no, he wasn't <i>friends</i> with them - he was <i>targeted </i>by them!

Id: [0x0024220F]
He's rich - or he was. Anytime someone in The Dagger needed to line their tunic with drachmae, they'd visit him.

Id: [0x00242210]
Then he may know the Kingfisher's true identity.

Id: [0x00242211]
Which would clear my brother's name.

Id: [0x00242213]
I have enough to go on. [beat]And the Kingfisher, if I discover he <i>is </i>your brother, if he is the man behind The Dagger...

Id: [0x00242214]
He won't be. Return to me when you've learned all you can.

Id: [0x00242218]
I've heard enough. I'll return once I've uncovered all I can.

Id: [0x0024221B]
A farmer who's had dealings with The Dagger...

Id: [0x0024221C]
I've met your farmer. He didn't know anything important.

Id: [0x0024221D]
Did you try mentioning my name?

Id: [0x0024221F]
I didn't know you were famous, Agapios.

Id: [0x00242220]
I'm not saying I'm famous, but in certain circles, well... My name will open doors.

Id: [0x00242221]
Have you found what we need to prove my brother's innocence and stop The Dagger?

Id: [0x00242222]
Not yet.

Id: [0x00242223]
The Dagger works in the shadows - we mustn't make a move until we've learned everything we can. Is there anything else I can tell you?

Id: [0x00242225]
Please misthios, help me uncover the Kingfisher's true identity. We can clear my brother's name and stop The Dagger. Euboea would be in your debt - more in your debt.

Id: [0x00242226]
[beat]The Magistrate's treasury runs deep... Your reward would not be small.

Id: [0x0024222A]
You mentioned... an evil theater?

Id: [0x0024222B]
The theater in Chalkis City is a more potent weapon than you realize, misthios. The Dagger use propaganda to poison the minds of Euboeans. See what you can learn there.

Id: [0x00242230]
I'm sorry, Agapios. Neritos <i>is </i>the Kingfisher. The Dagger's his operation.

Id: [0x00242234]
All that matters is stopping The Dagger.

Id: [0x00242235]
...Ah. So it is him. Of course it was him.

Id: [0x0024223A]
Neritos always was getting himself into trouble. A temple to Achilles[2386631] on Skyros, you said?

Id: [0x0024223B]
Agapios -

Id: [0x0024223D]
Stop, slave!

Id: [0x00242240]
No.

Id: [0x00242242]
That man earned his freedom long ago.

Id: [0x00242245]
Thanks to you, The Dagger's true face has been revealed, and Euboea has a chance at survival. You've earned your reward.

Id: [0x00242247]
Though I fear victory will not be as simple as storming Skyros. The Kingfisher's hid in the shadows for decades... There will be more to do before the end.

Id: [0x00242249]
Help me. Help Euboea.

Id: [0x00242251]
I will help you, Agapios, but you must be ready for the worst. The evidence doesn't look good for your brother.

Id: [0x00242253]
Kingfishers are common here! That name is no evidence of my brother's guilt.

Id: [0x00242255]
Whatever it takes, I'm in. Family can be... complicated. We'll clear your brother's name and save all Euboea while we're at it.

Id: [0x00242259]
I've been to the theater in Chalkis City. They didn't give me any helpful information.

Id: [0x0024225A]
You must return! Mention my name - tell them what's at stake. They could help us save Euboea!

Id: [0x00242261]
I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x00242262]
Good. Good. I'll lead a small force to Smuggler's Dock on Skyros. Meet me there, and together we'll finally crush The Dagger.

Id: [0x00242266]
Another time, perhaps.

Id: [0x00242269]
My forces will land on Smuggler's Dock on Skyros. If you change your mind, that's where you'll find me.

Id: [0x0024226F]
It was a place of honor and heroism. I bathed my blade in blood for years. But that was a different time. And I was a different man.

Id: [0x00242270]
How exactly did you become Hero of the Arena? What did you do?

Id: [0x00242277]
Hold still so I can make it clean.

Id: [0x00242279]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024227B]
I won't just kill you. There must be another way.

Id: [0x0024227C]
Please, <i>misthios</i>. The alternative is I lay here and die slowly.

Id: [0x0024227E]
My brother, Solon, has been missing for weeks!

Id: [0x0024227F]
I have some drachmae, but you must first find out what happened.

Id: [0x00242284]
I think I'll find more than silver in here.

Id: [0x00242286]
No one listens! They say he ran away! But he wouldn't leave me alone, he wouldn't! He knows I hate being by myself.

Id: [0x0024228A]
Surely you have friends from your days in the arena?

Id: [0x0024228B]
I did.

Id: [0x0024228C]
What happened to them?

Id: [0x0024228D]
I'm Hero of the Arena. The number one champion. [beat]I've killed them all in honorable combat. They rest down the coast from here.

Id: [0x00242291]
But how can he do that when he's not even here?!

Id: [0x00242292]
Please, can you help me find out what happened to him?

Id: [0x00242293]
I think the trainer might know more about my brother's disappearance, but be careful - rumor has it he can take out a Chimera with his bare fists.

Id: [0x00242294]
In any case, I'd take caution not to look for a fight.

Id: [0x00242299]
What about your family? Your daughter?

Id: [0x0024229A]
My beloved Anaia. The first time I held her in my hands, I knew I'd never be able to kill again. She's the reason I stopped fighting... even if I can't disentangle myself from the arena entirely.

Id: [0x0024229C]
I won't push any further. But come see me fight.

Id: [0x0024229D]
Or was it that he <i>looks</i> like a Chimera with bare fists?

Id: [0x002422A0]
I envy you, <i>misthios</i>. You have everything to gain. Don't let it slip away...

Id: [0x002422A3]
Please hurry, he wouldn't leave me alone for so long.

Id: [0x002422A9]
This is an outrage. We've had enough of those masked soldiers. They need to leave Lemnos one way or another!

Id: [0x002422AB]
It was founded by Theageneses, the famous Olympian.

Id: [0x002422AD]
Many others like my brother train here in hopes of becoming the next Olympic champion.

Id: [0x002422AE]
Under my charge, my students seize victories as easily as Theageneses seized the bronze statue of Thasos. Everyone has heard of me!

Id: [0x002422AF]
The only things that vanish here are the weaknesses in heart and body.

Id: [0x002422B7]
I recognize you! You were in the Olympics! You're the champion, I'm sure of it!

Id: [0x002422C3]
Men like you are the worst! I can't rely on you, I can't rely on anyone. I'm going to save my brother.

Id: [0x002422CD]
It's best if you stay here and keep out of their way. Let me deal with this.

Id: [0x002422CE]
I'm sorry that I'm not of much help.

Id: [0x002422D0]
A strong man like you shouldn't take orders from a drunk fool.

Id: [0x002422D1]
I... You're right.

Id: [0x002422D2]
I've been... weak, for far too long. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. I may still have other strengths to hone.

Id: [0x002422D4]
Is she your daughter?

Id: [0x002422EB]
Here, this should help you start again.

Id: [0x002422ED]
Oh, uh, I'm sorry <i>misthios, </i>but... this isn't enough.

Id: [0x002422EF]
I see.

Id: [0x002422F0]
The rebuild here is costly -

Id: [0x002422F1]
But I'll never forget that you tried. Thank you.

Id: [0x002422F4]
Why did they burn the house?

Id: [0x002422F5]
It will end.

Id: [0x002422F6]
Those soldiers are Cult guards, and there is a general among them. Don't worry, they won't be here much longer.

Id: [0x002422F7]
Yeah! Because we're going to go up there to end this.

Id: [0x002422F9]
Right?!

Id: [0x002422FB]
You know why. Maláka... Those cursed soldiers came down here from their cursed stronghold[2408133]. They thought Mikkos was up to something. Working against them. This has to end!

Id: [0x0024230A]
No! Stop hitting him!

Id: [0x0024230C]
You think you can take the Dagger on, theater man?

Id: [0x00242312]
I'll hit him as much as I like!

Id: [0x00242313]
You sent a <i>misthios</i> after one of ours?

Id: [0x00242315]
Mess with the Dagger and get <i>stabbed.</i>

Id: [0x00242316]
Stop... Please.

Id: [0x00242317]
You'll entertain me till the <i>misthios</i> returns, my friend.

Id: [0x00242318]
You best hope she gets here soon.

Id: [0x0024233E]
Keep up the slaughter, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00242340]
Eat well, <i>misthios</i>! You've earned it.

Id: [0x00242342]
The crowd loves you, Eagle Bearer!

Id: [0x00242344]
Merciless <i>misthios</i>! Such prime work!

Id: [0x0024234B]
You should all stay home. Keep each other safe. I'll take care of the Ancient Stronghold and the Cult guards.

Id: [0x0024234E]
Yes, you're right. <i>Maláka</i>, you're right. They're professional soldiers. We're humble merchants and fishermen. We're counting on you, <i>misthios.</i> They have plagued this region for too long.

Id: [0x00242358]
With your freedom you can acquire all that, you know.

Id: [0x00242359]
We all have different circumstances and abilities, <i>misthios</i>. This life offers me the best chance of survival.

Id: [0x0024235A]
The people of this island deserve revenge against the Cult guards.

Id: [0x0024235B]
That's right.

Id: [0x0024235D]
We will storm their stronghold[2408133] and retake it for the people of Lemnos.

Id: [0x0024235E]
That's right! Leave us to gather our weapons, <i>misthios</i>. We'll meet you at the gates.

Id: [0x0024236F]
Come watch the epic play... of Photios. The great man who brought a slave nation... to glory and riches.

Id: [0x00242370]
Ladies and gentleman! Come witness the epic story of Iolaos and how he helped Herakles defeat the Hydra!

Id: [0x00242371]
The amphitheater and its fantastic tales await you! Come visit us and learn more about our society! More about what we can do as common folk!

Id: [0x00242380]
Now showing at the amphitheater...

Id: [0x00242382]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00242383]
I'm done, misthios. I'm leaving. A life outside the arena gates is no longer for me. [&gasp]I need to move on.

Id: [0x00242386]
Just when you think you know someone.

Id: [0x00242388]
Come to the amphitheater and witness this moving tale!

Id: [0x00242389]
Tickets are free for first timers!

Id: [0x0024238A]
I'll be careful not to break too many bones.

Id: [0x0024238E]
My loyal students! This <i>misthios</i> has the nerve to challenge me, the great Euthymos, at <i>my</i> - ahem, <i>our</i> school!

Id: [0x00242392]
This must be Karpos's House. The smell of alcohol is enough to know.

Id: [0x0024239F]
Those are the wine jars Aietes mentioned. That must be Karpos's House.

Id: [0x002423A4]
That must be the cave[2376328] Karpos was talking about. I need to go in there.

Id: [0x002423C4]
The cave[2376328] where the prisoners are being held.

Id: [0x002423C9]
I hope those hedonistic fiends haven't trashed my place completely...

Id: [0x002423CC]
Where will you go from here? What will you do?

Id: [0x002423CE]
I need to live life the best way I know how.

Id: [0x002423CF]
Why do you want to leave the arena <i>now</i>?

Id: [0x002423D0]
It's because of you, <i>misthios</i>. I finally watched you in the arena.

Id: [0x002423D1]
Friend? Not old man?

Id: [0x002423D2]
Not old man. [beat]Friend.

Id: [0x002423D4]
Oh, before I leave. I've set up one last fight for you. The best arena fighter the Greek world has to offer. It won't be easy. But then again, nothing in the arena ever is. [beat]Are you interested?

Id: [0x002423D6]
I understand, friend.

Id: [0x002423F7]
I'll do it.

Id: [0x002423FA]
Perhaps some other time.

Id: [0x002423FB]
As you wish... If you want to fight in the arena[2400534] once I'm gone, talk to Praxis at the door. He'll handle such matters from now on.

Id: [0x00242403]
Ugh, I shouldn't have drunk so much. I need to train or I'll never beat Neleus.

Id: [0x00242404]
Oh, <i>misthiosss</i>! Comeee over hereee!

Id: [0x002424B0]
Get out of that cage right now!

Id: [0x002424B1]
It's for your own good!

Id: [0x002424B3]
You're being superstitious!

Id: [0x002424B8]
But the prophecy, <i>misthios</i>! What about the prophecy?!

Id: [0x002424DE]
According to this, the next stele is... Oh, better you than me! I can't swim. Explore the Ruins of Arne.

Id: [0x002424E0]
That armor will certainly make you stand out in a crowd.

Id: [0x002424E1]
The craftsmanship on that armor is exquisite.

Id: [0x002424E2]
That armor will deflect all but the mightiest of blows.

Id: [0x002424E3]
A suitable garment for a <i>misthios</i> such as yourself.

Id: [0x002424E4]
You'll be well protected wearing that.

Id: [0x002424ED]
What a mighty beast!

Id: [0x002424EE]
That looks like an impressive beast.

Id: [0x002424EF]
A mount from the gods' own stables.

Id: [0x002424F0]
A swift mount indeed. Must be related to the legendary Pegasos.

Id: [0x002424F1]
Barnabas, I didn't know you were here.

Id: [0x002424F2]
Sorry I missed dinner.

Id: [0x002424F3]
Didn't miss much.

Id: [0x002424F4]
Chin up. There's more to this world than Sparta. [beat]And lucky for us, we get to see it all.

Id: [0x002424F5]
You're right. Let's set sail.

Id: [0x002424FB]
Hiya!

Id: [0x002424FC]
Hello!

Id: [0x002424FD]
Bye...

Id: [0x002424FF]
What's wrong? You have a look about you.

Id: [0x00242500]
It feels weird saying this to you, but someone wants me to kill you.

Id: [0x00242501]
That's nothing new to me lately. Now where were we?

Id: [0x00242502]
Uh... I was surprised you remembered me.

Id: [0x00242508]
First things first. Someone... wants you dead.

Id: [0x00242509]
And you're the one they want to do it. Well, you're the first who's tried talking to me before attacking, so that's new.

Id: [0x0024250A]
You don't seem worried.

Id: [0x0024250B]
I have other things to worry about... Like giving my sick father all my time and attention.

Id: [0x0024250D]
You'd be hard pressed to find a better mount, my friend.

Id: [0x0024250E]
Let's see how it goes. Tell me where the next stele is.

Id: [0x00242517]
They'll serve you well.

Id: [0x0024251E]
What's your connection to Odysseus?

Id: [0x0024251F]
I'm a descendant of his. I'm named after him, too.

Id: [0x00242524]
These ruins are marked with a similar text as in the tomb.

Id: [0x00242529]
Some of the translation is lost on me. This passage speaks of <i>worth</i>.

Id: [0x0024252D]
I imagine they'll be of great help.

Id: [0x0024252E]
A fine addition to your crew.

Id: [0x00242531]
So I can take his ship <i>and </i>deal with the Cyclops at the same time. Two birds, one stone.

Id: [0x00242536]
A powerful ally you've got there.

Id: [0x00242537]
They'll make a great addition to your crew.

Id: [0x0024253B]
Those are the herbs Odessa needs.

Id: [0x00242540]
That merchant should be the one Odessa mentioned.

Id: [0x00242545]
You had your chance, Odessa!

Id: [0x0024254A]
Maybe we should check them for clues.

Id: [0x0024254F]
These men work for the leader of Megaris... Seems like Odessa's been causing some problems for them, and they're also after her father's estate.

Id: [0x00242552]
You've caused enough problems for us!

Id: [0x00242553]
That will look really good.

Id: [0x00242554]
That's sure to brighten up your ship.

Id: [0x00242555]
Might as well look fabulous while working.

Id: [0x00242556]
A great look.

Id: [0x00242557]
That will do nicely.

Id: [0x00242558]
You'll have the finest ship on the Aegean.

Id: [0x0024255A]
BYYYYE!

Id: [0x0024255B]
Bye...

Id: [0x00242574]
Hello this is a second input!

Id: [0x00242577]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00242578]
Whatever you need, name it, it's yours. I could bend some metal for you, oil those rippling muscles... Fix that broken spear?

Id: [0x0024257A]
Now, my West Wind, your timing is sharper than a spear point. I have a much more serious matter to discuss. Follow.

Id: [0x00242581]
Finally, I thought the master was going to forget to send the hoe I asked for.

Id: [0x00242582]
Glad I could help.

Id: [0x00242588]
Still breathing?

Id: [0x00242589]
Everything hurts, so I guess so.

Id: [0x0024258A]
Galateia limped home after her ship was attacked. She lost vital cargo, and several of her crew were taken prisoner. [beat]You could fix these problems for me.

Id: [0x0024258D]
You're all right for a stranger. Look, the water's tasted like a rusty blade for the past few weeks. Last time I had water like that was when I was downriver from a blacksmith.

Id: [0x0024258E]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00242599]
Here you go. This should make digging easier.

Id: [0x002425A3]
There are quite a few pigs around. Want to have some fun with them?

Id: [0x002425A4]
How do you mean...

Id: [0x002425A5]
If you have to ask, you're in for a real treat.

Id: [0x002425A6]
[&gasp]Wow! People usually can't catch me off guard. You're funnier than I imagined you'd be.

Id: [0x002425AA]
That will make your ship stand out.

Id: [0x002425AB]
Your enemies will certainly see you coming.

Id: [0x002425AC]
You'll be the jewel of the sea.

Id: [0x002425AD]
I've never seen a ship like it.

Id: [0x002425AF]
What do you need?

Id: [0x002425B2]
Xenia, I can't. Not now.

Id: [0x002425B7]
Yes, well, he needs his sword back.

Id: [0x002425B8]
And I'd love to give it to you. [beat]His sword, I mean. But, I can't just hand over swords to every gorgeous warrior who walks by.

Id: [0x002425BE]
Odessa means well. I worry about her...

Id: [0x002425C3]
I've never felt this sick... Maybe it's my time to meet Hades.

Id: [0x002425D5]
I should head to the leader's house to find out what's going on.

Id: [0x002425DA]
That's the place. Any proof to be found should be there.

Id: [0x002425DF]
This letter mentions Odessa's estate, and how crucial it is that they get it. "By any means necessary"...

Id: [0x002425E4]
This letter claims that Odessa hired other mercenaries. I wonder why...

Id: [0x002425E9]
The leader of Megaris tried arranging a marriage for Odessa. [beat]Sounds like an easy way to get her father's estate.

Id: [0x002425EE]
One of Odessa's suitors died mysteriously shortly after meeting her.

Id: [0x002425F2]
Galateia, tell your story.

Id: [0x002425F3]
We were sailing near Pellene, when we were ambushed. Our ship was boarded and sunk. I escaped, but I lost our prized cargo.

Id: [0x002425F8]
I think I have enough to go on. I should return to Odessa.

Id: [0x002425FD]
One day I'll be greater than Odysseus.

Id: [0x00242602]
I'll need to be careful. This place is heavily guarded.

Id: [0x00242606]
The leader of Megaris is after Odessa's estate, and he's tried arranging a marriage for her to take control of it after her father dies.

Id: [0x00242607]
But these letters also claim one of her suitors was killed, and nobody's sure how... Though she's been known to hire other mercenaries.

Id: [0x0024260A]
He's been feeling a lot better thanks to you.

Id: [0x0024260B]
You aren't worried someone will come after him?

Id: [0x0024260C]
I'll be sure to share the information you found with a few people. They won't touch him so long as we have it.

Id: [0x0024260D]
Then I'm happy to have you aboard.

Id: [0x0024260E]
You deserved it, but you still almost tricked me into believing you were fully innocent. It was impressive.

Id: [0x0024260F]
Thanks... I think.

Id: [0x00242610]
Plus, your father should be fine now that you have proof they've wanted you both out of the picture. They wouldn't dare attack him while you're gone. So, what do you say?

Id: [0x0024263F]
Penelope's shroud. In the flesh. [beat]I mean cloth.

Id: [0x00242647]
I should search her for the necklace.

Id: [0x0024264C]
I hope this necklace brings him some peace.

Id: [0x00242672]
You shouldn't waste any time. The <i>krypteia</i> must be killed.

Id: [0x0024267B]
You there. Could you help an ailing woman by getting some mint?

Id: [0x0024267C]
I picked some up on my way.

Id: [0x00242685]
Since you're being so polite, I already have them.

Id: [0x00242686]
And the other generals dare to doubt me! There's no way Neon can take credit for this one.

Id: [0x00242687]
He's taken credit before?

Id: [0x00242688]
You could say that. However, I'm the one who hired you. I have more work for you, if you're ready.

Id: [0x0024268D]
That doesn't make finding them easier.

Id: [0x0024268E]
I was too busy holding in my guts to worry about what banner they were flying.

Id: [0x0024268F]
Calm yourself. Galateia told me the thieving scum retreated to the Olouros Fortress.

Id: [0x00242690]
Yeah, in Achaia.

Id: [0x00242698]
You won't be disappointed.

Id: [0x0024269A]
You'll be delighted to know I already got you another set of seals.

Id: [0x0024269C]
What?

Id: [0x0024269D]
No need to thank me. Just doing my job.

Id: [0x0024269E]
You mean to tell me... You...! I...! You already killed more Spartans. Fine. Well, then, you should be available to do more work, yes?

Id: [0x002426A1]
Here you go. The herbs you needed.

Id: [0x002426A2]
Fresh is better for my stomach. But since the blight, dried is all we have left.

Id: [0x002426AA]
A prized old coffer for Xenia.

Id: [0x002426AB]
Many died in the fighting, but I saw at least three dragged off by the <i>malákes</i>.

Id: [0x002426AC]
And where were you?

Id: [0x002426AD]
Bleeding in the surf, trying to make sure I did not go to the crows. So someone would live to tell the tale.

Id: [0x002426AE]
The back patch of land is riddled with blight like I've only seen once before. My old master lost his whole farm to it. I'll never forget the smell.

Id: [0x002426AF]
The back of the farm? I'll take a look.

Id: [0x002426BB]
Fine. I'll get the flowers, and you'll give me the spear. I mean sword. I mean... don't go anywhere.

Id: [0x002426BD]
Give me the sword, and I'll make this a day you'll never forget.

Id: [0x002426BE]
Oh! Um... I... just... That would make every dream I've ever had come true. There's just one tiny problem. You see, my "spear" is also broken, if you catch my meaning.

Id: [0x002426BF]
Shame.

Id: [0x002426C2]
Just give me the sword, or I'll make this a day you'll never forget.

Id: [0x002426C3]
Oh! I... there's no need to get all heated. Tell you what. I'm drinking wine with someone special tonight, and I'd really like to... make a good impression. But there's a small problem. My "spear" is also [&ahem]broken.

Id: [0x002426C4]
What a shame.

Id: [0x002426C7]
But! There are special flowers in the forest beyond the Xerxes Military Fort. Planted by Aphrodite herself. They really help to... um... re-forge, if you know what I mean.

Id: [0x002426D1]
Any better?

Id: [0x002426D2]
It only hurts when I breathe, so...

Id: [0x002426D3]
Ask your questions.

Id: [0x002426D9]
I found the thief.

Id: [0x002426DD]
That little pickpocket and I need to talk.

Id: [0x002426E4]
Is that? It can't be...

Id: [0x002426E9]
The witness. There you are.

Id: [0x002426EB]
Perfect! So, did you mean what you said, about making this a day I'd never forget?

Id: [0x002426EF]
That's the thief! You won't escape.

Id: [0x002426F3]
There's the supplies.

Id: [0x002426F7]
That's the chest. But it's guarded.

Id: [0x002426F9]
Perfect. These will make tonight a night to remember!

Id: [0x002426FA]
I'm very happy for you. Now, what you promised.

Id: [0x002426FB]
Of course, of course. Umm, I was just wondering, since you're here. What if I took the flowers now? There's a clean spot in my shop where we could...

Id: [0x00242701]
That's Deianeira, the champion.

Id: [0x00242705]
Drakon... You're a big boy.

Id: [0x00242746]
If you're looking for the farmer, you just missed him. Check the road headed east.

Id: [0x0024274A]
Don't hurt us. We're just cave diggers.

Id: [0x0024274C]
Did you not see?

Id: [0x0024274E]
I haven't seen a fight from inside the arena in years. But if the crowds are cheering like that, perhaps I have a hero on my hands after all...

Id: [0x00242751]
Did you find them? Are they safe?

Id: [0x00242754]
No! Curses. I didn't think this could happen.

Id: [0x0024275D]
I think you were too hard on your nephew.

Id: [0x0024275E]
You say that now, but <i>you</i> told me before that he needed tough love.

Id: [0x00242761]
The Cult got there before me.

Id: [0x00242762]
We did all we could.

Id: [0x00242763]
There must be something we missed. Something I've done wrong, no matter how small.

Id: [0x00242764]
We didn't do this Barnabas, the Cult did. We must remember that.

Id: [0x00242765]
I'm sorry for your loss.

Id: [0x00242768]
What of the other villagers? Are they safe?

Id: [0x00242769]
Many of them wanted revenge. They stormed the Cult stronghold[2408133] with me, but -

Id: [0x0024276A]
But what?

Id: [0x0024276B]
But none survived.

Id: [0x0024276C]
Argh! This cursed day! You have to put an end to the Cult once and for all, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0024276D]
I will, Barnabas. I will.

Id: [0x00242770]
They're safe. I went to the stronghold[2408133] myself and cleared the Cult out of Lemnos permanently.

Id: [0x00242776]
Who? I've never heard your name before today.

Id: [0x00242777]
Then you must be quite deaf!

Id: [0x00242781]
Skoura?

Id: [0x00242782]
Good. That's one bit of news I won't have to grieve on this cursed day. Thank you for that, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00242783]
I wish I could have done more.

Id: [0x00242784]
I know.

Id: [0x00242786]
They say that you loo- that you can take down a Chimera with your bare fists.

Id: [0x00242788]
These rumors, they are too kind! And all true.

Id: [0x0024278C]
What did you find? Are they OK? Did you run into the crew I sent? They haven't returned either.

Id: [0x0024279A]
Weeks. It's been weeks. He would never leave me alone for so long.

Id: [0x002427A7]
We'll see what you are made of then, hmm? We'll fight like <i>real</i> champions!

Id: [0x002427A9]
What? No. Please no. Let me stay!

Id: [0x002427AA]
I won't hear it. Leave now, before I pay this <i>misthios</i> to kill you. Go!

Id: [0x002427AC]
Here's your payment for returning my vase.

Id: [0x002427AD]
Not so fast, champion. We found Mikkos and Neleus before the Cult arrived.

Id: [0x002427AF]
Neleus! Thank Zeus!

Id: [0x002427B0]
Hello, uncle.

Id: [0x002427B1]
Let him go. He needs to rest.

Id: [0x002427B3]
We arrived just before the Cult burned the house. They probably think Mikkos and Neleus are dead.

Id: [0x002427B7]
Can you withstand the might of my spear?

Id: [0x002427BE]
Solon was one they looked closely at, I presume.

Id: [0x002427C0]
Yet you do nothing, even when you clearly know something isn't right.

Id: [0x002427C1]
This fellow has powerful allies and influence. I've tried to do something, misthios. I've asked questions, and I was told to stop for my own good and the good of the students. As much as I hate to admit, I am powerless.

Id: [0x002427C4]
Neleus!

Id: [0x002427C6]
They found us just before the Cult guards arrived. We were nearly killed.

Id: [0x002427C8]
No!

Id: [0x002427DB]
We're lucky Neleus wasn't killed. It sounds like certain death was just minutes away.

Id: [0x002427DC]
And how about the villagers?

Id: [0x002427E4]
Play nice, my students!

Id: [0x002427E6]
My <i>mater</i> hits harder!

Id: [0x002427EE]
Ugh... Waaay too long. I need to - ugh - shake this off and start training so I can...

Id: [0x002427EF]
You did the right thing, sending the crew to check on them. They'd be dead if you hadn't.

Id: [0x002427F0]
I don't think I would have, except you told me to be easier on Neleus. I thought better to lend help rather than to leave him in the shadow of my tough love.

Id: [0x002427F1]
Glad I could help.

Id: [0x002427F2]
And what of all the other villagers?

Id: [0x002427F6]
I'm afraid many of them charged the Cult stronghold[2408133] along with me. None survived.

Id: [0x002427F8]
Such loss of life.

Id: [0x002427F9]
At least I have Neleus. And you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x002427FB]
Come, Neleus. We have much catching up to do.

Id: [0x00242806]
Taste the true might of my students!

Id: [0x00242811]
Long night?

Id: [0x00242813]
Defeat Neleus! And ride that victory to become the Olympic -

Id: [0x00242817]
I take it you're Aietes. Mikkos sent me. Neleus -

Id: [0x00242819]
Neleus?! What now? Did he break another record?!

Id: [0x0024281D]
You won't defeat our master, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00242822]
The villagers are fine. I sent them home and chased the Cult out of their stronghold[2408133] myself.

Id: [0x00242823]
You continue to amaze, Kassandra. You didn't just save my nephew, you saved all of Lemnos and Thasos from the Cult guards plaguing them.

Id: [0x00242824]
Come Neleus. I have many stories to catch you up on.

Id: [0x00242829]
Something seems to be going on over there.

Id: [0x0024282B]
This is your last chance, <i>misthios</i>. It can all end if you simply walk away.

Id: [0x0024282C]
Are you done talking?

Id: [0x0024282F]
We're all alone now, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00242830]
After such an adventure, I'm sure you want to take some time to relax.

Id: [0x00242834]
Yes, he did.

Id: [0x00242835]
Oh, curses! What record did he break this time? I bet it was the discus throw. No, wait. Maybe...

Id: [0x00242836]
Projectile vomiting.

Id: [0x00242837]
Huh?

Id: [0x00242839]
Zeus! He even beats me at throwing up?! Curse you and your perfections, Neleus!

Id: [0x0024283B]
So Mikkos sent you here just to break my spirits?

Id: [0x0024283D]
No, he didn't. He's bound to his bed.

Id: [0x0024283E]
Oh, just another drunken night of celebration, then.

Id: [0x0024283F]
Then it must've been quite a night.

Id: [0x00242840]
Huh?

Id: [0x00242841]
Neleus has taken ill. Mikkos sent me here because you were the last one to see him well.

Id: [0x00242842]
He was fine when we went to Karpos's House for the usual, uh -

Id: [0x00242843]
Dose of hedonism -

Id: [0x00242844]
But... I didn't leave the party with him. Or see him since.

Id: [0x0024284A]
You know, I <i>would</i> like to relax.

Id: [0x0024284B]
So much has happened. Has it changed what you will do now?

Id: [0x0024284C]
It hasn't changed a thing. We will rebuild the house and we will rebuild Neleus's stamina. He will be an Olympian yet.

Id: [0x00242855]
In my younger days, I was known for my massages.

Id: [0x00242856]
I don't want a massage.

Id: [0x00242857]
Then what do you want?

Id: [0x00242858]
First, I want you to kiss me. Then, I'll want you to take me somewhere private. Finally, I'll want you to take off all of your clothes.

Id: [0x00242860]
Look for Karpos at his house[2386625] on the hill, he probably knows what happened to Neleus.

Id: [0x00242862]
As you command.

Id: [0x00242865]
He's a reclusive man, though. You will need to get his attention.

Id: [0x00242866]
[&ah]Who am I kidding, maybe I'm just not cut out for this Olympic stuff.

Id: [0x00242868]
Something must have happened at the party, then.

Id: [0x0024286A]
It's been a while, hasn't it, Roxana?

Id: [0x0024286B]
Too long. Do you have some time now?

Id: [0x00242870]
Thank you, Aietes. I'll look into it.

Id: [0x00242872]
Well, I better get started or I'll never catch up to Neleus and the rest.

Id: [0x00242875]
Good. I've got a couple minutes.<LF>

Id: [0x00242876]
I was thinking a couple hours.

Id: [0x00242877]
Let's try one minute at a time.

Id: [0x0024287B]
Since you joined our ship, I haven't seen much of you. What have you been doing?

Id: [0x0024287C]
Oh, you know, the typical things. Firing flaming arrows, bracing for impacts... and rowing. Lots and lots of rowing. Look at these arms.

Id: [0x0024287E]
Nice.

Id: [0x0024287F]
Being the Olympic champion doesn't sound as impressive as traveling across the Greek world.

Id: [0x00242880]
Come work for me on my ship and see new sights. I could use someone with your arms... Strong, rower's arms.

Id: [0x00242881]
I've always wanted to travel...

Id: [0x00242882]
And you know what, I'm sick of this training day in and day out. Count me in, <i>misthios!</i> I mean, captain.

Id: [0x00242884]
Aietes, you <i>will</i> be an Olympic champion. Believe in yourself.

Id: [0x00242885]
You're right! I can do this. I've just got to work extra, extra hard.

Id: [0x00242887]
Thank you for believing in me! I'll beat Neleus and all the others.

Id: [0x00242888]
It'll start with the right attitude.

Id: [0x0024288A]
Do your best, Aietes. See you later.

Id: [0x00242894]
Now is not the time. There are seas to sail and Cultists to kill.

Id: [0x00242895]
Bah! You're no fun.

Id: [0x00242898]
Oh, hello <i>misthios! </i>Can I help you with anything else?

Id: [0x0024289A]
You can do this, Aietes! You can do this! Just keep going and you'll become an Olympic champion!

Id: [0x0024289D]
I'm afraid there is still too much to do. Too many to kill. Relaxing is not an option.

Id: [0x0024289E]
That's unfortunate. I thought... Well, I thought... Nevermind what I thought. I see how it is. Goodbye, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0024289F]
Goodbye, Mikkos. And good luck.

Id: [0x002428A6]
Olympic champion Aietes! Yeah, that sounds perfect! I'll be the best the Greek world has ever seen.

Id: [0x002428AC]
<i>I don't believe </i>-

Id: [0x002428B1]
Thank the gods, you heard me!

Id: [0x002428B2]
Sounds serious. How can I help?

Id: [0x002428B3]
I'm thirsty. Usually my husband fills me up, but I haven't seen him in a while, [beat]so if you could just reach over there and grab me the wine -

Id: [0x002428B4]
I'm a misthios, I don't fetch wine. Wait, your husband's missing?

Id: [0x002428B5]
Oh - well yes, I suppose he is.

Id: [0x002428B7]
I need to speak with your husband.

Id: [0x002428B8]
Oh forget him, <i>I</i> need your services.

Id: [0x002428B9]
Is that right?

Id: [0x002428BA]
Would you fetch me a drink? [beat]The slaves are all busy, and I'm quite parched.

Id: [0x002428BB]
I - No! The wine's right next to you!

Id: [0x002428BD]
Somewhere on the eastern road. [beat]I think? Delivering wheat and grapes.

Id: [0x002428BF]
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him in days. A lot of days. Weeks? Oh... oh no, I think he might be in trouble!

Id: [0x002428C1]
You must be drinking a lot if you didn't notice your husband was missing.

Id: [0x002428C2]
Yeah. Between you and me, it's hard to notice anything after enough wine.

Id: [0x002428C3]
I hear husbands can be hard to keep track of. They're always getting lost.

Id: [0x002428C5]
Ooh! Look who it is!

Id: [0x002428C6]
You know you want some of [belch]this.

Id: [0x002428C7]
Heyyy! Don't ignore me, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x002428C8]
Am I not your type?

Id: [0x002428C9]
Well, you're not my type either! Fine. Don't come over here.

Id: [0x002428CA]
OK, OK, I'm joking. Come here. I'll make it up to you, I <i>promise.</i>

Id: [0x002428CD]
Hello, hello? <i>Misthios?</i>

Id: [0x002428D3]
Where to now, Eagle Bearer?

Id: [0x002428D4]
Smuggler's Dock on Skyros. We need to meet the Magistrate.

Id: [0x002428D5]
Skyros it is!

Id: [0x002428DD]
There it is, Smuggler's Dock. Bring it in easy.

Id: [0x002428E2]
Now to find the Magistrate.

Id: [0x002428E4]
What have you done?! You murdered the - Oh, no, no, no. The general is going to kill me.

Id: [0x002428E6]
You're with the Cult, aren't you? What did you do to Neleus -

Id: [0x002428F3]
Look, here comes that drunken, wait -

Id: [0x002428F4]
That's not Karpos! He's supposed to come alone.

Id: [0x002428F5]
Kill the interloper, then!

Id: [0x00242915]
Hey! No one's allowed in here.

Id: [0x00242916]
Help us... Please. Where am I?

Id: [0x0024291A]
The Doctor should be here by now. He's late.

Id: [0x0024291B]
He came by earlier, but these idiots won't stay drunk for long. Make sure you lock the cell until he gets back.

Id: [0x0024291C]
So... did you take it too?

Id: [0x0024291D]
Huh?

Id: [0x0024291E]
You know, the tonic. You were from Thasos, weren't you? Do you remember taking the tonic?

Id: [0x0024291F]
I... don't remember anything. It's all hazy.

Id: [0x00242936]
<i>Misthios! </i>Thank Zeus, he was going to kill me!

Id: [0x00242937]
The moment I arrived on Thasos, the Cult of Kosmos never stood a chance.

Id: [0x00242938]
We were lucky this time. Who can say what happened to the other students.

Id: [0x0024293A]
Hmm... The Doctor must have come by to administer it.

Id: [0x0024293D]
The Cultists need to pay for what they've done. Now is the time to retaliate.

Id: [0x0024293E]
You sound like you have a suggestion.

Id: [0x0024293F]
We need to storm their Ancient Stronghold, misthios.

Id: [0x00242941]
This Ancient Stronghold, where is it exactly?

Id: [0x00242949]
I want you to tell me everything you know about the Dagger.

Id: [0x0024294A]
Daggers? They're like cute lil' baby swords.

Id: [0x0024294E]
What? No. <i>The </i>Dagger. The Dagger <i>you </i>just mentioned!

Id: [0x00242957]
This general, tell me more.

Id: [0x00242958]
That <i>malákas</i> strong-armed me into this whole mess. He's the head of the elite Cult guards, and rumor has it he beheaded eight men with one swing of his polearm.

Id: [0x00242959]
You mentioned a physician?

Id: [0x0024295A]
Yes, <i>The </i>Doctor.

Id: [0x0024295F]
He treats the injured and the sick here, but, like me, he's been under the Cult's thumb. They've got him administering their tonic.

Id: [0x00242960]
If you're going to pay him a visit, you should be able to find him at the Aliki Quarry.

Id: [0x00242962]
At least now I know for sure Neleus doesn't just have a cold. Mikkos needs to know about this.

Id: [0x00242964]
This is all your fault, so make sure these students get home safe.

Id: [0x00242965]
I will.

Id: [0x00242966]
That's right.

Id: [0x00242968]
What else do you need?

Id: [0x00242969]
That'll be all.

Id: [0x00242975]
Well? Did you find anything?

Id: [0x00242976]
The Dagger's dagger. Seemed important.

Id: [0x00242978]
What? You're ready to go again? Give me a while, misthios. I need a break.

Id: [0x0024297C]
I'll never forget you.

Id: [0x0024297D]
No. You won't.

Id: [0x00242981]
I should get this back to Supideo's parents before he does anything <i>stupideo</i>.

Id: [0x0024298F]
Loook whooo's hereee!

Id: [0x00242991]
Mikkos? You should be at home taking care of Neleus.

Id: [0x00242993]
[&laughs]I should be doing a lot of things, [&laughs]but right now -

Id: [0x00242994]
I <i>want</i> to have some fun.

Id: [0x0024299C]
I'll have to be careful Spyro doesn't get hurt.

Id: [0x00242B2F]
The polemarchs believe it's an easy victory.

Id: [0x00242B34]
I'll gut every last Athenian responsible for this. Fucking cowards. Once they're dead, Stentor will know I'm worthy of fighting by his side.

Id: [0x00242B9C]
If I want to get close to the Wolf, I'll have to help Stentor defeat the Athenians. I shouldn't waste any time.

Id: [0x00242BA1]
I can smell that malákas's stench.

Id: [0x00242BA8]
The statue of Poseidon. They sure made it big enough.

Id: [0x00242BA9]
Let us hope Poseidon takes no offense to that. We <i>are</i> on the sea, after all.

Id: [0x00242C09]
There's still more for you to do in Lakonia, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x00242C0B]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00242C0F]
Athens... Let's see what this city has in store for me.

Id: [0x00242C14]
I should use Ikaros to find what I need.

Id: [0x00242C16]
You look like you could use a little <i>fun. </i>And I'm plenty of it.

Id: [0x00242C1B]
Those blue supply crates with the white owl are the ones I need to destroy.

Id: [0x00242C2B]
Interesting... it seems Xenia doesn't control the entire island.

Id: [0x00242C2D]
Good news, General?

Id: [0x00242C35]
This won't be like any other battle I've been a part of.

Id: [0x00242C3B]
That's all for now.

Id: [0x00242C56]
So how about it? You and me. Let's have a great time.

Id: [0x00242C5A]
What? Just us?

Id: [0x00242C5B]
Ohhh! Now we're talking.

Id: [0x00242C5D]
So what were you thinking? <i>Him?</i>

Id: [0x00242C60]
I need a moment to prepare... and then I'll tell a story to take your breath away!

Id: [0x00242C65]
Or <i>her?</i>

Id: [0x00242C66]
I have work to do, Mikkos. Work <i>you</i> sent me to do. I'll pass.

Id: [0x00242C67]
But nooo. Work can wait just for a bit. I promise I won't take long.

Id: [0x00242C68]
Increasingly less interested.

Id: [0x00242C6A]
<i>Maláka</i>!

Id: [0x00242C6C]
Ah, no matter.

Id: [0x00242C7B]
Actually, I already have more seals for you.

Id: [0x00242C7C]
Ha. Well done. Ready for more, then?

Id: [0x00242C7D]
Why don't you tell your little friends to leave?

Id: [0x00242C7F]
I'm all you'll need.

Id: [0x00242C80]
Well, you heard the <i>misthios</i>. Get lost!

Id: [0x00242C85]
Yes! You've come back! So how about it?

Id: [0x00242C86]
Come on! Let's have a good time together.

Id: [0x00242C87]
I'm going to go with him.

Id: [0x00242C88]
Perfect, [&laughs]I was thinking the same.

Id: [0x00242C89]
We'll see.

Id: [0x00242C8B]
I'm the greedy type. Let's go with both of them.

Id: [0x00242C8C]
Oh, you just made my night, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00242C8D]
Shut up already.

Id: [0x00242C8F]
She might be my type.

Id: [0x00242C90]
Hmm, I hope I'm your type, too.

Id: [0x00242C93]
I... I can still continue -

Id: [0x00242C94]
I honestly doubt you could even stand right now.

Id: [0x00242C95]
I mean, I could just lie here -

Id: [0x00242C96]
Maybe later. Goodbye, Mikkos.

Id: [0x00242CA1]
The part of Athens I doubt Perikles is proud to talk about.

Id: [0x00242CA6]
You there! <i>Misthios! </i>I have something you may be interested in.

Id: [0x00242CAB]
Who do they think they are? I need to stop them.

Id: [0x00242CB0]
There he is.

Id: [0x00242DCA]
Thank you for letting us live.

Id: [0x00242DCB]
It won't be easy for us now, but we'll figure something out. Thanks to you, we still have that chance.

Id: [0x00242DCE]
Ooh!

Id: [0x00242DCF]
How horrid! Poor Perseus!

Id: [0x00242DD5]
My husband is away at war, and I have official business to attend to. Can you escort him for me?

Id: [0x00242DD6]
I can do all those things, too!

Id: [0x00242DD7]
He's scum!

Id: [0x00242DE0]
This must be what she wants.

Id: [0x00242DE7]
And? This story is for the crows.

Id: [0x00242DE8]
These seals should satisfy you.

Id: [0x00242DE9]
Excellent. Yes, you've done well.

Id: [0x00242DED]
Is being on the Adrestia anything like the Siren Song?

Id: [0x00242DEE]
I was in a different place when I sailed that ship. Physically, mentally... I didn't have direction then.

Id: [0x00242DEF]
We both have direction now.

Id: [0x00242DF0]
Speaking of, where are we headed?

Id: [0x00242DF1]
Wherever we want.

Id: [0x00242DF2]
I won't be taking orders from you. Just so you know.

Id: [0x00242DF3]
But I'm the captain.

Id: [0x00242DF4]
I also want to steer. And choose where we're headed.

Id: [0x00242DF5]
[scoffs]I don't think so.

Id: [0x00242DF6]
Fine. But if anyone gets seasick on me, they're dead.

Id: [0x00242DF7]
Sounds fair to me.

Id: [0x00242DF8]
I love the sea air. The smell. It feels so good to be back.

Id: [0x00242E00]
Did you inspect the ship? Is she ready for sailing?

Id: [0x00242E01]
It was checked, yes.

Id: [0x00242E02]
And the crew? They're well trained?

Id: [0x00242E03]
Yes, Nikolaos.

Id: [0x00242E04]
No need for that. A sailor must know these things.

Id: [0x00242E05]
I have sailed a ship my whole life. You're in good hands.

Id: [0x00242E07]
[beat]Of course I am. Captain.

Id: [0x00242E09]
They should know enough to take care of themselves...

Id: [0x00242E0A]
Yes, but the world is full of unexpected dangers, and I cannot leave my charges to investigate properly.

Id: [0x00242ECE]
I knew it!

Id: [0x00242ECF]
Shh! I knew it, too!

Id: [0x00242ED1]
Well, it's not exactly Samos[1016766] <i>or</i> Lesbos[1016762], but a small island nestled between. In the bosom of the ocean, one might say.

Id: [0x00242ED2]
Stick to the statue. What is it?

Id: [0x00242ED8]
Scytale!

Id: [0x00242ED9]
All right, scytale.

Id: [0x00242EDC]
Athena's golden owl? That's dumb!

Id: [0x00242EDD]
Sounds cute! I want one!

Id: [0x00242EDE]
And armed with the vorpal sword from mighty Olethros, he faced the snake-necked, large-headed, shaggy-maned, stony-gazed Catoblepas!

Id: [0x00242EE3]
Here's the temple[2384576]. Now to find the clue at the statue.

Id: [0x00242EE7]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x00242F00]
I did. Now you can protect yourselves from... [switches to spooky voice]the prophecy.

Id: [0x00242F01]
Oh yes. Cut her in half. She won't steal anything from anyone ever again.

Id: [0x00242F02]
Oh, he's very much alive. We did things in the back of his workshop that would make Aphrodite blush!

Id: [0x00242F03]
This is awful.

Id: [0x00242F04]
<i>Mater</i>, <i>pater</i>, what's wrong? You're safe - the prophecy's broken.

Id: [0x00242F05]
Actually, there's something we've been meaning to tell you. Supideo, you were adopted.

Id: [0x00242F06]
What?!

Id: [0x00242F07]
A young couple brought you to us. They knew we'd give you a better home. That sword and shield is your inheritance from them.

Id: [0x00242F08]
Wait, so the <i>thief... </i>and the blacksmith...

Id: [0x00242F09]
Are Supideo's birth parents. You killed his <i>mater</i> and fucked his <i>pater</i>.

Id: [0x00242F0A]
But the prophecy said <i>pater</i> would scream to the gods in agony.

Id: [0x00242F0B]
He screamed. But not in agony.

Id: [0x00242F0F]
He's fine. Could use a cold bath, but he's fine.

Id: [0x00242F10]
Thank the gods!

Id: [0x00242F11]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>! You spared my parents from my wrath. Now, if you would release me.

Id: [0x00242F12]
Actually there's something your <i>mater</i> and I have to tell you. Your parents are...

Id: [0x00242F13]
[&breath]Very happy to have such a caring son to protect us.

Id: [0x00242F15]
Thank you, <i>misthios. </i>We're all fine now.

Id: [0x00242F19]
So... you found the thief?

Id: [0x00242F1A]
And what about the blacksmith?

Id: [0x00242F1B]
You didn't.

Id: [0x00242F24]
These must be the flowers.

Id: [0x00242F29]
Welcome, my friend. My name is Sargon, Curator of Mythical and Extraordinary Antiquities.

Id: [0x00242F2B]
I have everything your heart could desire and more. For a price, of course.

Id: [0x00242F31]
This almost sounds too good to be true. Don't attempt to scam me, merchant.

Id: [0x00242F32]
By the gods, I would never dream of such a thing.

Id: [0x00242F34]
I've never met a merchant so proud of his goods. Your items must be impressive.

Id: [0x00242F35]
They're the finest in all the Greek world, I promise you that, or may Zeus strike me down.

Id: [0x00242F37]
I'm always happy to part with some drachmae if the price is right.

Id: [0x00242F38]
I'm not interested in drachmae. The only currency I accept is orichalcum.

Id: [0x00242F3E]
What exactly do you sell?

Id: [0x00242F3F]
Many things, my friend. Many things. I have weapons, armor, fashionable garments, and accessories for you, your friends, [beat]and even your ship.

Id: [0x00242F40]
What kind of merchant doesn't take drachmae?

Id: [0x00242F41]
The kind who is interested in rarer and more valuable forms of payment.

Id: [0x00242F42]
Tell me where to find orichalcum.

Id: [0x00242F43]
You can find it all over the Greek world if you know where to look. You can also check the message board for special jobs. Sargon is not the only one to deal in orichalcum.

Id: [0x00242F44]
All right, let's see what you have to offer.

Id: [0x00242F49]
Time to find this thief.

Id: [0x00242F4E]
Looks like blood. I've had dreams of drowning in a lake just like this one.

Id: [0x00242F53]
This must be the cave. Perfect hiding spot for a thief.

Id: [0x00242F58]
There's my little thief.

Id: [0x00242F5D]
This shield should be enough to protect Supideo's parents from his deadly wrath.

Id: [0x00242F62]
Who thought these ridiculous costumes were a good idea?

Id: [0x00242F64]
I haven't crossed half the world to give up now.

Id: [0x00242F68]
Did you find something?

Id: [0x00242F6D]
That island is tiny. No wonder I've never seen it on any maps.

Id: [0x00242F6E]
Small or not, it exists. Maybe it will play a large role in something one day. Only the gods know.

Id: [0x00242F70]
Supideo mentioned a cave beyond the Red Lake. Strange that his parents knew this. They should get the shield back themselves.

Id: [0x00242F83]
Hiyah!

Id: [0x00242F84]
I'll get you!

Id: [0x00242F85]
For Sparta!

Id: [0x00242F8A]
Time to get Phoibe out of here.

Id: [0x00242F8C]
Here it is, the scytale! Now I can decode the messages.

Id: [0x00242F8D]
I will avenge you, Phidias. Rest assured of that.

Id: [0x00242F94]
Please, misthios! Go see the blacksmith and get me my sword.

Id: [0x00242F96]
I did.

Id: [0x00242F97]
Thank the gods! I knew I could count on you! But this is only one of the items I needed, and I have <i>two</i> parents.

Id: [0x00242F9B]
<i>Misthios</i>, you've returned! Did you bring the sword?

Id: [0x00242F9D]
Welcome back, my friend. You wouldn't believe the amazing items I have in stock for you today.

Id: [0x00242F9E]
Where do you get all of these things, Sargon? I never see you leave your stall.

Id: [0x00242F9F]
I have a network of associates combing the world for items of interest. When they find something special, they bring it to me.

Id: [0x00242FA4]
So, tell me about this shield.

Id: [0x00242FA5]
Well, according to my parents it was stolen while I was visiting the Oracle of Delphi.

Id: [0x00242FA6]
Stolen? It's as good as gone then.

Id: [0x00242FA7]
I overheard <i>mater</i> and <i>pater</i> whispering about it. They mentioned a cave beyond the Red Lake. Talked about the thief as if they knew her.

Id: [0x00242FA8]
Strange.

Id: [0x00242FA9]
Go to the cave, <i>misthios</i>. Bring me back my shield. Only then will my parents be truly safe from my fury.

Id: [0x00242FB0]
Find the cave near the Red Lake. The thief and the shield should be there.

Id: [0x00242FC8]
You know what you're doing.

Id: [0x00242FC9]
I see the value in things that others dismiss. It's a skill I have sharpened over many years.

Id: [0x00242FCB]
So, your associates do all the hard work. I hope you pay them well.

Id: [0x00242FCC]
Of course I do. The great Sargon, Curator of Mythical and Extraordinary Antiquities is generous to those who help him succeed.

Id: [0x00242FCE]
Interesting. Show me what you have in stock.

Id: [0x00242FD1]
Odd family.

Id: [0x00243035]
Can't wait.

Id: [0x002435E4]
I don't want to lose this one, too.

Id: [0x002435E5]
Tell me where I can find your husband.

Id: [0x002435E8]
Oh! Right!

Id: [0x002435E9]
They're just men, <i>misthios</i>. Greedy. Delusions of grandeur. Bleeding dry the drachmae of poor innocent slave masters, like me.

Id: [0x002435EA]
Ah, so it's Euboea you're here to save. Still, thank you.

Id: [0x002435EE]
I can't. What he'll do to me... What he'll do to my wife...

Id: [0x0024360B]
No, no, I haven't found him yet.

Id: [0x0024360C]
Oh. Well. Do you have more questions?

Id: [0x0024360D]
What about Anaia? Think of her, Skoura!

Id: [0x00243618]
Not bad for an old man, huh?

Id: [0x0024361E]
What were you thinking?! Why would you step foot in here against me? What about Anaia, your daughter?

Id: [0x0024361F]
Anaia's gone. She's been dead for nine years.

Id: [0x00243621]
So when you said you'd see her again...

Id: [0x00243622]
I was scared that when I finally saw her again, she'd see what I'd become - a useless old man... But you showed me there was still a way I could go to her proudly.

Id: [0x00243623]
As Hero of the Arena...

Id: [0x00243626]
Do you think she'd be proud?

Id: [0x00243627]
...You said "The Dagger," like they were a group, or -

Id: [0x00243628]
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, right. <i>The </i>Dagger!

Id: [0x0024362B]
Don't worry, your husband's safe.

Id: [0x0024362C]
Thank you, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00243631]
She'd be proud. [beat]I would be.

Id: [0x00243632]
I'll tell her of a new Hero of the Arena. A warrior of true honor.

Id: [0x00243634]
Thank you, friend.

Id: [0x00243641]
No. I couldn't be... I couldn't be.

Id: [0x00243647]
I shouldn't even be in here. I'm not a slave!

Id: [0x00243654]
Not bad for an old man. Not bad at all.

Id: [0x00243655]
I am! I swear! You've taken everything!

Id: [0x00243656]
Tell us where you keep your drachmae!

Id: [0x0024365C]
I've been thinking of her every day since she was born. And now more than ever.

Id: [0x0024365D]
You need to rethink this. You don't know what you're doing...

Id: [0x0024365E]
I know exactly what I'm doing.

Id: [0x00243660]
You're going to have to fight me, <i>misthios</i>. I won't hesitate killing you if you let me.

Id: [0x00243661]
Fine, old man. I'll send you into the next life.

Id: [0x00243662]
By all means!

Id: [0x00243663]
I won't fight you, friend. I refuse.

Id: [0x00243664]
Then you choose death, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00243671]
Haven't I seen you before somewhere? [beat]You fight in the arena. Yeah! You're not that bad!

Id: [0x00243679]
Don't you worry, you'll win at least one more fight. [smiling]Everybody wins their first few.

Id: [0x00243680]
You smell like an old sandal!

Id: [0x00243686]
I don't think you smell like a sandal, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024368A]
My uncle's always ranting about those arena fights. They're rigged, right?

Id: [0x0024368D]
You are, aren't you?

Id: [0x0024377B]
What were their last orders?

Id: [0x0024377E]
I had sent them to a lookout camp, where they were to survive on their own for a few days. It is up to them to treat it seriously... But when I went to check on them, there was no sign.

Id: [0x0024377F]
Wait. I found one already. It caught my eye.

Id: [0x00243780]
By <i>Zeus</i>, you're a natural at this. Did it also come with armor?

Id: [0x00243781]
Part of it.

Id: [0x00243783]
Welcome back, <i>misthios</i>. I'm always happy to see you.

Id: [0x00243784]
I'd be happy to see you more if you agreed to accept drachmae.

Id: [0x00243785]
Sorry to disappoint, my friend, but I'm still only interested in orichalcum.

Id: [0x00243786]
What do you do with that strange metal?

Id: [0x00243787]
Its value is beyond compare. It's ancient and worth far more than mere drachmae. [beat]I'm just one of the few to realize this.

Id: [0x00243788]
All right, keep your secrets. Show me what you have.

Id: [0x0024378D]
What dangers did you expect them to face?

Id: [0x0024378F]
The students learn to watch for wolves and bears. But I saw no spoor.

Id: [0x00243790]
Perhaps a different sort of beast...

Id: [0x0024379F]
Hmm, I don't see any soldiers here. Only pirates. They must be running the whole island.

Id: [0x002437A5]
I believe you have something that belongs to me.

Id: [0x002437B1]
Ah, my friend! You see fit to grace me with your presence once again. I'm honored.

Id: [0x002437B3]
Your flattery is wasted on me, Sargon.

Id: [0x002437B4]
I think it's important to make people smile, [beat]especially in such troubled times as these.

Id: [0x002437B5]
What do you think of the war?

Id: [0x002437B6]
War is a way of life for most of us. If we aren't killing each other, we're fighting someone else.

Id: [0x002437B7]
So you don't support any one side?

Id: [0x002437B8]
Of course not! I have no stake in war, and picking a side simply reduces my potential customers. [beat]A smart merchant stays neutral during such conflicts.

Id: [0x002437BE]
Staying out of the conflict is a wise move.

Id: [0x002437BF]
All Sargon knows is that he's alive no matter who wins.

Id: [0x002437C1]
You can't stay out of war. It has an impact on everyone no matter how much you try to avoid it.

Id: [0x002437C2]
I'm not staying out of it, far from it. No, Sargon is greatly involved. I'm selling weapons and armor to mercenaries like you, am I not?

Id: [0x002437C4]
Nevermind, just show me what you have.

Id: [0x0024395A]
Cheer up. Only one stele left to go.

Id: [0x0024395B]
You're right. There's a temple[2155417] in the City of Orchomenos, near the harbor. You may find it there.

Id: [0x00243960]
What?

Id: [0x00243979]
The rewards of skill and effort!

Id: [0x0024398D]
The Athenians are scared in their homes by now. They won't come and fight us.

Id: [0x0024398E]
Of course not! Who would dare meet us in an open field? Their politics can't save them now.

Id: [0x0024398F]
We still have to take the city.

Id: [0x00243990]
And we will. In time, Athens will be ours.

Id: [0x002439A7]
You sail around in this thing?

Id: [0x002439A8]
Of course. The Adrestia is a mighty vessel.

Id: [0x002439A9]
It doesn't seem very wise.

Id: [0x002439AA]
Are you nervous, little brother?

Id: [0x002439AB]
You wish. Where do you intend to sail this wreck anyway?

Id: [0x002439AC]
Wherever the wind takes us.

Id: [0x002439B3]
This is the marble quarry Brasidas mentioned.

Id: [0x002439B8]
There's only one Spartan here that I need to kill. It'll be easier if I don't alert the others.

Id: [0x002439BD]
One down, four to go.

Id: [0x002439C2]
That's two. Time to find the others.

Id: [0x002439C7]
Three weapon racks destroyed. Won't take much longer.

Id: [0x002439CC]
Only one more to go.

Id: [0x002439D1]
That was the last one. The Spartans are strong, but even they need weapons.

Id: [0x002439DA]
There's so much blood!

Id: [0x002439DB]
Life ends, hot and messy.

Id: [0x002439DE]
So, you got it then.

Id: [0x002439DF]
Of course I got it, but the bastards stabbed me while I was getting out.

Id: [0x002439E0]
That's a shame, we can't have you slowing us down. [beat]But the upside is less people to split the drachmae with.

Id: [0x002439E1]
Wait, please, we don't have to do this.

Id: [0x002439E2]
Sorry, but there ain't no we anymore.

Id: [0x002439EB]
This leaves only one more to go. And then the ritual will be activated.

Id: [0x002439ED]
You're back! Does that mean you're ready to continue the search for the stele fragments?

Id: [0x002439F1]
Hurry back with both stele pieces. I hope the gods find me worthy.

Id: [0x002439F3]
That's why you won't be coming back with us.

Id: [0x002439F4]
What? What do you mean?

Id: [0x002439F5]
One less person to split the drachmae with. Don't worry, I'll leave you a coin for the ferryman. Consider that your cut.

Id: [0x002439F7]
I found one of the steles when I was exploring ancient ruins.

Id: [0x002439F8]
That's good, <i>misthios</i>. It'll give me a head start while you search for the other.

Id: [0x00243A2A]
Any luck deciphering more of the writing?

Id: [0x00243A2C]
The scytale message told me to find a secret room in the stronghold[2408133] in Lemnos... So that's where I should go.

Id: [0x00243A30]
Hello, stranger. You may think I look like Phidias, but it is simply the strangest of coincidences... Don't forget to meet me at the docks at night... Farewell, person I've never met. [beat]Whoever you are.

Id: [0x00243A38]
Well, here's the stronghold[2408133]. Now let's see what they're hiding.

Id: [0x00243A39]
What's your strategy?

Id: [0x00243A3A]
Whatever it takes to protect Athenian lives and kill Spartans.

Id: [0x00243A41]
What kind of elixir uses ingredients like this?

Id: [0x00243A44]
No, I need to keep looking...

Id: [0x00243A46]
Maybe if I press here...

Id: [0x00243A4B]
Someone went to a lot of trouble to hide this.

Id: [0x00243A4C]
I had hoped, but hiring you was a gamble.

Id: [0x00243A4D]
Most things in life are.

Id: [0x00243A4E]
I am perhaps a bit more willing to gamble than my fellow generals would like.

Id: [0x00243A5D]
So, it's divine intervention?

Id: [0x00243A5F]
Whatever that means.

Id: [0x00243A60]
Are you ready?

Id: [0x00243A61]
Don't worry, I'll be back as soon as I can.

Id: [0x00243A62]
Thank you. Now hurry, and look to the statue of Zeus in his temple[2384576] to find the message. Once I have the clue, I can decipher it with the scytale.

Id: [0x00243A70]
I'll look for the others.

Id: [0x00243A72]
Must've been quite the smell.

Id: [0x00243A73]
[&laughs]Quite the offering to the gods... The ashes fed the soil and the next year, the stalks were higher than ever before.

Id: [0x00243A74]
Hmm. Not just yet.

Id: [0x00243A76]
A dishonest merchant got the better of you?

Id: [0x00243A77]
His act burns in my breast! The maps pointed to relics that would be crown pieces in my collection. Find them, and I'll shower you with drachmae.

Id: [0x00243A78]
I didn't expect the stele keystone to actually be a key.

Id: [0x00243A85]
It doesn't matter if we can find them. Will you look for the other stele pieces?

Id: [0x00243A8F]
Stand your ground!

Id: [0x00243A99]
Ah! So fast!

Id: [0x00243AA8]
I will not fear!

Id: [0x00243ABE]
For Theoros!

Id: [0x00243AC6]
I wonder what happens when all of them are in place.

Id: [0x00243ACA]
You can't get some mint for yourself because...?

Id: [0x00243ACB]
The master keeps all the medicine. I can pick and dry the herbs, but I'm not allowed any for myself.

Id: [0x00243AD6]
For Sparta!

Id: [0x00243AD8]
Will the hurt go away?

Id: [0x00243AD9]
Tell you what, you have to scare it away. If you roar like a lion, it'll run.

Id: [0x00243ADC]
They underestimate Spartans.

Id: [0x00243ADD]
Time to strike again. Athenian command will be slow to retaliate. Ready to kill more of their fort commanders?

Id: [0x00243AFF]
If we found these, then we'll find the other stele pieces too. I'll go look.

Id: [0x00243B02]
Not just yet.

Id: [0x00243B04]
Even with the full keystone in place, some of the meaning may be lost on us.

Id: [0x00243B06]
There's another smith nearby. Real shit-eater. Undercuts me to the soldiers and makes shoddy weapons.

Id: [0x00243B0C]
If your craft is better, you'll be back in business once his weapons start breaking.

Id: [0x00243B0E]
I'd hate to be the soldier whose weapon breaks in battle.

Id: [0x00243B10]
I'll starve to death waiting for customers to realize he's a fraud. I need to do something now. I know when and where he goes to pick up his second-rate supplies...

Id: [0x00243B1D]
It says the ritual will activate something. But what? What will happen when we have all of the pieces? Will it lead to a treasure?

Id: [0x00243B29]
Do you have the location for the missing piece?

Id: [0x00243B2A]
This text is hard to make sense of. It appears to be a warning. Be careful when you explore the Tomb of Orion.

Id: [0x00243B2B]
I'll be careful.

Id: [0x00243B30]
We've put up with the bandits round here, they've gotta eat, too. Sometimes they even give me a little business. But this is too much.

Id: [0x00243B31]
What's happened?

Id: [0x00243B32]
There's a sword I was working on, a present for my brother. Bandit chief just walked up and took it out from under my hammer.

Id: [0x00243B4C]
My brother is a soldier at the front. I'm no fighter, but I've made a sword for him to win glory for our family.

Id: [0x00243B4D]
That's a noble thought.

Id: [0x00243B4E]
Thank you, but I don't know what to do. I can't get the sword to him for all the bandits on the path. I feel like I've failed him.

Id: [0x00243B56]
The soldiers who've taken control... They treat my weapons like it's their private supply.

Id: [0x00243B5C]
Some warriors don't see the impact their fighting has on civilians.

Id: [0x00243B5E]
Everyone is suffering. You've lost supplies, but many more have lost their lives.

Id: [0x00243B60]
It's a bad time, all right. And because I've been resisting them, they're coming for my head.

Id: [0x00243B68]
Weasel-faced little son of a jackal merchant.

Id: [0x00243B69]
Having a bad day?

Id: [0x00243B6A]
Offered me half of what we agreed on. My family is hungry, and I had to take it. My weapons making him a profit... I'd rather they sink to the bottom of the ocean.

Id: [0x00243B96]
Was a shipwreck or something near here. Divers were bringing me all kinds of gems to make inlays and decorations for my swords.

Id: [0x00243B97]
"Were bringing"? Why aren't they still bringing them to you?

Id: [0x00243B98]
All those divers attracted sharks, I guess. There's still a chest or two down there, but they won't go near it.

Id: [0x00243BA0]
The soldiers here took my armor and paid me a pittance for it. Just took what they wanted and left a few coins.

Id: [0x00243BA7]
I recognize that dagger you have there, <i>misthios</i>. I made some like that once for a bad mercenary. A ruthless killer. She nearly gut me over the deal.

Id: [0x00243BA8]
Oh, I found it on a body I came across.

Id: [0x00243BA9]
I don't know what they were doing with it, but I don't want that mercenary coming back here looking for more daggers. And you probably don't want her looking for you...

Id: [0x00243D93]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x00243D95]
Skyros! The Dagger are on Skyros, <i>misthios</i>! Kill them all!

Id: [0x00243D97]
Kill them for us -

Id: [0x00243D9A]
Stupid girl. Spoiling my fun...

Id: [0x00243D9B]
She was my choice too, are you sure -

Id: [0x00243D9C]
Go to Skyros, <i>misthios</i>! What Agapios seeks, you'll learn everything! About the Dagger, about Ne -

Id: [0x00243D9D]
Whew, that was a close one. Couldn't risk this little man running his mouth on more than he should have.

Id: [0x00243D9E]
You couldn't even let them say goodbye? I'll wipe that grin off your -

Id: [0x00243D9F]
Well, now you've heard some things we really wish you hadn't. And you've been so cooperative too! Such a shame. A shame, I tell you!

Id: [0x00243DA0]
But it's time for the hero to die now. Kill the <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00243FF0]
Your husband must have enemies or something. Someone who might want to make him go missing?

Id: [0x00243FF2]
The Dagger. If you're wealthy, they're your enemy.

Id: [0x00243FF9]
Come to see the richest man in Achaia, have you?

Id: [0x00243FFA]
You don't <i>look</i> rich.

Id: [0x00243FFE]
Stop, slave! Guards! GUARDS!!!

Id: [0x00244001]
Kassandra. [&laughs]What have you brought me?

Id: [0x00244004]
If I could see those old theorems in their original beauty, I would die a happy man.

Id: [0x0024400D]
Rich, wanting for nothing, <i>and</i> calling me over to help. Doesn't make sense.

Id: [0x0024400F]
Ah! [&laughs]A mind that thinks for itself. Someone save me from this horror.

Id: [0x00244013]
There's one thing that makes a person rich - drachmae. The only people who say otherwise don't have any.

Id: [0x0024401D]
I don't really do "math."

Id: [0x00244020]
So, you get the theorems, and I get a reward... From a man who seems completely disinterested in drachmae.

Id: [0x00244021]
[&laughs]Drachmae is for idiots. What I offer is far greater than that. But first, the theorems.

Id: [0x00244022]
Fine. What are they?

Id: [0x00244023]
Only the greatest achievements of rational thought - the original transcriptions of the Golden Ratio, the Pythagorean Theorem, and Zeno's Paradox.

Id: [0x00244039]
I found the original Golden Ratio.

Id: [0x0024403A]
A discovery that will change the course of existence!

Id: [0x0024403B]
It took some doing, but I found the Pythagorean Theorem.

Id: [0x0024403C]
The greatest breakthrough the world will ever know. And now we have it, in its original glory.[&laughs]

Id: [0x00244041]
So, I found Zeno's Paradox.

Id: [0x00244042]
You did! [&laughs]And, what did you think of it?

Id: [0x00244043]
About the Golden Ratio...

Id: [0x00244044]
Ah! The divine number. It's a guiding principle in architecture, sculpture, and is found in nature, too. The original is wasting away in the dirty hands of sculptors in Argos. It should be with a mathematician... like me![&laughs]

Id: [0x00244045]
Where am I going to find the Pythagorean Theorem?

Id: [0x00244046]
It's all around you, of course! Deceptively simple, but subtly mysterious, the equation was apparently etched in stone. I heard a tale... It was lost in sunken ruins between three islands that form a triangle.

Id: [0x0024404B]
I'll find these theorems for you.

Id: [0x0024404D]
Tell me about Zeno's Paradox.

Id: [0x0024404E]
Myself excluded, [&laughs]Zeno of Elea was the world's brightest philosopher, known for writing paradoxes that could stump anyone. His work was thought destroyed, but I happen to know the priests in Lokris saved it.

Id: [0x0024405C]
That was... a lot to take in. But I think I've found everything.

Id: [0x0024406B]
Sounds fun. But I'm not here for your theories. I did this to get paid.

Id: [0x0024406D]
From a riddle, a triangle, and a rectangle? I can't wait.

Id: [0x00244070]
[&gasp]Shame. It's been a while since I had a student, and there was a moment I thought I found one in you. [&hmm]I was wrong. But, you did as you were asked. For that, take this.

Id: [0x00244071]
I'm a <i>misthios</i>, not a student. Nice working with you, Demokritos.

Id: [0x00244077]
What is this theory?

Id: [0x00244078]
Using the theorems as evidence, I intend to prove that the universe is divisible into infinitely smaller parts. As we break reality down, the parts shrink, and the space between them grows.

Id: [0x00244079]
Once you prove your theory, what will you do with it?

Id: [0x0024407A]
Although I aim to prove that the universe is divisible, I hope that the theory can be used... to unite people.

Id: [0x00244082]
If that's what you want to do, let's do it.

Id: [0x00244085]
We should go to her, Demokritos. But wait a moment. When I'm ready, we'll go together.

Id: [0x00244089]
There is no force in the universe greater than that which binds two people together.

Id: [0x0024408C]
You! Come here. I need your help with something.

Id: [0x00244090]
The Golden Ratio. Demokritos will want to know I've found it.

Id: [0x00244094]
Demokritos was right. The Pythagorean Theorem is here and it's... a triangle. All right.

Id: [0x002440A0]
One of the documents Demokritos wants... This isn't even math. It's a child's fable.

Id: [0x002440B2]
Please Neritos, this isn't you.

Id: [0x002440BC]
There was still some good you might have done.

Id: [0x002440C3]
But not anymore. Now you're filling that void.

Id: [0x002440C4]
Maybe... maybe what fills the void, and what draws us together, is love.

Id: [0x002440C5]
Save that line for the poet, Demokritos. It's a good one.

Id: [0x002440C6]
You think so? All right, I will!

Id: [0x002440C8]
I never would've guessed you were a lover.

Id: [0x002440C9]
Well, I wasn't. My theory - that all atoms exist with a great void between them - is a bit like the life I've lived.

Id: [0x002440CE]
...About <i>me?</i>

Id: [0x002440D0]
Well, she'd had some wine.

Id: [0x002440D2]
Don't worry, taking on shadowy organizations is my specialty.

Id: [0x002440D7]
<i>Misthios</i>, please. I'm in pain.

Id: [0x002440D8]
I'm ready, <i>misthios</i>. Do it.

Id: [0x002440E1]
Over here, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002440E6]
The Dagger keep taking and taking... I don't know what she'll do if I ever run out. [beat]I know she loves me, I just... I'd rather not find out how<i> much</i> she loves me.

Id: [0x002440E7]
Still, you've earned a reward. I keep... an "emergency" stash of drachmae in a cave[2106194] behind a waterfall not far from here. It's directly north of where my cart crashed.

Id: [0x002440EC]
Oh, brother, what have they done to you?

Id: [0x002440EF]
Gross.

Id: [0x002440F8]
Surprised?

Id: [0x002440FF]
Fine by me.

Id: [0x00244100]
I found him, but I was too late. If only I had known he was at the quarry[2408858] all along.

Id: [0x00244105]
Skoura said even the gods will cheer for this one...

Id: [0x0024410B]
Yes! A <i>misthios</i>. Kill those masked <i>malákes</i>. Kill them good.

Id: [0x00244110]
That's the last of Agapios's leads. Better tell him what I've learned. [beat]He isn't going to want to hear this.

Id: [0x00244114]
Kill the<i> misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00244117]
My pose is so much better.

Id: [0x0024411C]
I still need to meet all of Agapios's contacts.

Id: [0x00244122]
<i>This</i> is the cave[2106194] the husband was talking about? Looks like I've already paid it a visit.

Id: [0x0024412B]
I should go back to the Doctor for the antidote.

Id: [0x0024412F]
<i>Misthios!</i> The Dagger know we're here! We need to move fast!

Id: [0x00244135]
Die, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024413A]
The <i>misthios</i>! Kill them!

Id: [0x0024413D]
The villagers are dead. [beat]I need to hurry.

Id: [0x00244141]
They stopped coming to school soon after the men came. I worry that something has happened to them.

Id: [0x00244145]
The misthios! Don't let them reach the temple[2386631].

Id: [0x00244149]
A dead slave. Looks like he fell off something at speed. The husband's cart, maybe?

Id: [0x0024414B]
[excited]You're the winner! [insulting]Of the stupidest warrior contest!

Id: [0x00244158]
What have I done...

Id: [0x0024415A]
Her brother...? By Zeus, I... What have I done?

Id: [0x00244162]
You're such a badass, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00244170]
Solon and others are missing. Maybe Neleus was going to be next... Mikkos will want to know about this.

Id: [0x00244176]
The little girl's brother is still missing, and so is my reward.

Id: [0x0024417B]
If the Cult guards did this, I'll need to hurry back. Neleus... There won't be much time.

Id: [0x00244180]
That whole arena fighting thing might work out for you after all, huh?

Id: [0x00244184]
What exactly happened to all these people? It looks like a slaughter.

Id: [0x00244185]
The Cult guards happened. Yes, yes. It was a slaughter. They were here to send a message to you, <i>misthios</i>. They know you've been snooping around.

Id: [0x00244188]
You're the ultimate warrior, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024418D]
Oh, <i>misthios</i>... You look so... <i>brave</i> in person.

Id: [0x00244192]
I'm too late.

Id: [0x0024419B]
<i>Misthios</i>! Oh, yeah! [grunt]Yeaaaaaaaaaaah, <i>misthios</i>! Get it! Gooooo <i>misthios</i>! Wooooooo!

Id: [0x002441A0]
This is bad. If the Cult will attack large groups of people out in the open -

Id: [0x002441A1]
Who knows what they'll do next.

Id: [0x002441A2]
We have to get to Neleus. He may be in danger.

Id: [0x002441A3]
He's certainly in danger. We have to move fast.

Id: [0x002441A9]
We need to move fast. The Cult guards are on a rampage.

Id: [0x002441AA]
Ah, but I've sent some crew ahead to check on Neleus. They should bring him back to the ship so we can keep a closer eye on him.

Id: [0x002441AB]
This madness needs to stop.

Id: [0x002441AC]
But it will! We have the Eagle Bearer on our side.

Id: [0x002441BD]
Coooome on! Give me more than that, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x002441D5]
The <i>misthios</i> is here. It's time, everyone. Ready your weapons and CHARGE!

Id: [0x002441E1]
Be like the <i>misthios</i> and kill these <i>malákes!</i>
<LF>

Id: [0x002441E8]
<i>...Malákas </i>Minotaur<i>...</i>

Id: [0x002441EE]
I really need to charge more for slaying mythical creatures...

Id: [0x002441F4]
Aaaand here we go.

Id: [0x002441FA]
Well. The <i>malákas</i> Minotaur.

Id: [0x00244200]
Can't believe... I killed the Minotaur. [beat]<i>Mater </i>would be so proud.

Id: [0x00244204]
That must be the general.

Id: [0x00244206]
Stop holding back!

Id: [0x0024420C]
I have some arrangements to make...

Id: [0x0024420E]
Skoura! You could stop this!

Id: [0x00244216]
...Impossible...

Id: [0x0024421B]
The bigger they are, the more I have to stab them.

Id: [0x0024421D]
Gods. All the villagers are dead.

Id: [0x00244223]
I remember when the biggest thing I had to kill was a fucking Minotaur...

Id: [0x00244229]
He does <i>not </i>look happy. Let's see if I can cheer him up.

Id: [0x0024422E]
Is it just me, or are these <i>malákes</i> getting bigger?!

Id: [0x00244235]
And I thought Empedokles was the handsomest one in the family.

Id: [0x0024423A]
What will I do now? What will I do?

Id: [0x0024423C]
I'm not joking, old man!

Id: [0x0024423D]
Neither am I!

Id: [0x00244245]
This tonic must be special.

Id: [0x0024424B]
Gyaaaah...!

Id: [0x00244252]
This... is not of this world...

Id: [0x00244257]
Must be another way.

Id: [0x0024425C]
Guess his family wasn't happy to see him.

Id: [0x0024425E]
We shouldn't talk like this with Neleus in this condition. Now, about those leads you mentioned -

Id: [0x00244263]
Good, misthios! Good! The gods will sing songs of this!

Id: [0x00244265]
Yes, yes! It makes my pets so strong!

Id: [0x00244269]
Bryce!

Id: [0x0024426E]
Ligeia must have picked up the artifact and transformed into that creature. [beat, softer]I wonder how many people have become "The Writhing Dread" over the centuries...?

Id: [0x00244274]
...By Zeus, I hate snakes.

Id: [0x00244276]
Then they caged you.

Id: [0x00244277]
Well, they refused to let me return to my pets. So I poisoned a few of them, yes, yes.

Id: [0x00244280]
The medicine could be helpful to Neleus. First, I should deal with the Doctor's captors.

Id: [0x00244286]
A convenient story if something bad were happening to them.

Id: [0x00244287]
Exactly.

Id: [0x00244293]
I'll search for the remaining steles.

Id: [0x00244296]
Sorry. I'll come back later.

Id: [0x002442A0]
No! That's her! Those bandits... Stop them!

Id: [0x002442A3]
Good job. Now run along home.

Id: [0x002442A6]
My peers will finally listen to what I have to say.

Id: [0x002442B2]
You mustn't free me! These ropes are the only thing between my parents and my wrath!

Id: [0x002442B8]
Looking for this?

Id: [0x002442B9]
Oh! Excellent.

Id: [0x002442BD]
Are you ready to find the two final steles?

Id: [0x002442C1]
It's done. I'll bring the seals to the General.

Id: [0x002442C3]
General Lysander will want these seals.

Id: [0x002442C5]
That's enough seals for the General.

Id: [0x002442C9]
[screams in pain]You killed <i>mater</i> and had sex with <i>pater</i>!

Id: [0x002442CA]
Supideo, I had no idea.

Id: [0x002442CB]
I can't get the image out of my head. I don't want to see anymore!

Id: [0x002442CF]
I have enough enemy seals. The General's point has been made.

Id: [0x002442D8]
[screams in pain]I'm blind, <i>misthios</i>! Are you happy?

Id: [0x002442E1]
Don't release me! Not until my parents have the weapons to defend themselves!

Id: [0x002442F8]
The soldiers got a lion in a cage near here. I wanted to make the hinges for the cage, but the work went to a rival of mine.

Id: [0x002442F9]
That's unfortunate.

Id: [0x002442FA]
It is. Be even more unfortunate if that beast got loose and something bad happened to it. Or the soldiers. I bet my rival wouldn't get the work next time...

Id: [0x002442FC]
Yes, I’m Lykaon. You must be a misthios. Are you here for treatment?

Id: [0x00244301]
Your plan is working.

Id: [0x0024431E]
I've had bandits trying to rob me of my wares since I left the city. And I've just heard that they're coming back for more.

Id: [0x0024439D]
That depends. Will I have to roar for you, too?

Id: [0x0024439E]
Sometimes the best medicine I can give my patients is a dose of hope. I take it you're not in need of care?

Id: [0x002443A1]
It's the Spartan way.

Id: [0x002443A7]
Where did you get that sword hilt?

Id: [0x002443A8]
This? I found it in a chest.

Id: [0x002443A9]
It looks like my father's style. I had forgotten about these swords. Bandits made off with them years ago. I'd love to get my hands on them again if any others survived.

Id: [0x002443B0]
A group of thieves has been hassling me. They say they're going to come and kill me if I don't pay them.

Id: [0x002443B1]
You seem... happy about that?

Id: [0x002443B2]
I'm a blacksmith! I meet mercenaries like you all the time. And even if I didn't, I swing a hammer for a living. These are some stupid thieves, misthios. Let's have some fun!

Id: [0x002443BF]
I'm healthy as a horse.

Id: [0x002443C1]
The soldiers near here are the best business for the people in the village. But they treat us terribly.

Id: [0x002443C7]
Difficult neighbors is a small price to pay for your well-fed family.

Id: [0x002443C9]
Their drachmae doesn't excuse their actions.

Id: [0x002443CB]
Would serve them right to have to give the village even more business. Be a shame if the weapons and food they already ordered got ruined, wouldn't it?

Id: [0x002443CD]
Play-acting instead of medicine? When I'm wounded, I prefer to see someone serious.

Id: [0x002443CE]
The gods and the medicines they give us can do little when a patient has no hope. That's the best treatment I can give.

Id: [0x002443CF]
You've thought this through.

Id: [0x002443D3]
I had a fine sword for a commander here, but some pirates in the dock roughed me up and grabbed it.

Id: [0x002443D4]
That sword is likely long gone out of port, friend.

Id: [0x002443D5]
They haven't left yet, but they'd better soon. I'm not the only one ready for payback.

Id: [0x002443D6]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002443D7]
One of their ships was sunk this morning. [beat]My sword is likely at the bottom of the sea now. And there's still more pirate ships in the port.

Id: [0x002443DA]
These seals should help convince them.

Id: [0x002443DB]
By way of corruption. Dirty drachmae. They <i>killed</i> people in a war they made themselves.

Id: [0x002443DC]
Fueling war was one of the methods, yes. But it was controlled. [beat]Until suddenly it wasn't. And then I didn't like what we were doing anymore.

Id: [0x002443DD]
Not in the way we hoped. As you know, he's impossible to control. He worked his way to the helm, and then he held even more sway than I did.

Id: [0x002443E0]
Not you, your bloodline. People like Leonidas, [beat]like you, have always posed a threat. Then we met, and you surprised me. You were nothing like Deimos.

Id: [0x002443E1]
Wait. [beat]Did Perikles know?

Id: [0x002443E2]
You must be a physician.

Id: [0x002443E3]
Are you too busy to pick them?

Id: [0x002443E4]
Too chewy. A pack of wolves is resting near the stream. I'll pay you generously for your trouble.

Id: [0x002443E6]
That's all of the seals General Demosthenes requested. Time to head back.

Id: [0x002443F0]
They consider me much lower than a Spartan.

Id: [0x0024440A]
The task is done. Here are the seals as proof.

Id: [0x00244423]
If you're done wasting time... Go and strike the fort commanders down.

Id: [0x0024442D]
The doctor and the herbalist don't always see eye to eye here, but both seem to need blades hammered for their treatments of this blood fever plaguing the village.

Id: [0x0024442E]
You should rest.

Id: [0x0024442F]
I will, but I can get a few more done first. Just need to get them there. The boy who usually runs the deliveries... Well, he's gone.

Id: [0x00244431]
Kassandra.

Id: [0x00244432]
Although I'd enjoy the sight of you a lot more if I wasn't tired of taking care of my sick father.

Id: [0x00244440]
That old house? It was barely standing to begin with.

Id: [0x00244441]
I meant Kephallonia. A sickness has spread across the island. They say it started in Kausos. There doesn't seem to be a cure... many have died.

Id: [0x00244442]
Maláka. That priest was right.

Id: [0x00244443]
Just say the word. We can return to Kephallonia whenever you wish.

Id: [0x00244444]
Thanks, Barnabas. I'll keep that in mind. Let's go.

Id: [0x00244446]
Oh, and Kassandra, in all the excitement I nearly forgot. Terrible things have happened to your home.

Id: [0x00244447]
This knife. I'm making it for a writer who is... fond of my daughter.

Id: [0x0024444D]
Congratulations on your daughter's happiness, then.

Id: [0x0024444F]
I don't see what some writer seeing your daughter has to do with me.

Id: [0x00244451]
My daughter won't be spending time with any good-for-nothing writer! I won't have my girl living in poverty while this woman scribbles away. This knife is to scare her off or to go in her neck!

Id: [0x00244456]
You seem pleased, General.

Id: [0x00244469]
The time I sink into finding these trinkets for you had better be amply rewarded.

Id: [0x0024446B]
Does my little hoplite feel undervalued?

Id: [0x0024446C]
I don't see you risking your life over wild waters.

Id: [0x0024446D]
Ha! In my youth I sailed every sea and explored every island as if driven by Poseidon. But now I carry a burden like Atlas. Don't worry, Kassandra. I have a fat purse for your efforts.

Id: [0x00244473]
An amazing piece. You will look magnificent with it, like Aphrodite herself.

Id: [0x00244474]
I am no soft and simple plaything.

Id: [0x00244475]
No, of course not. It will look mighty -

Id: [0x00244476]
Stop trying to insert your tongue in my ass.

Id: [0x0024447B]
I could use a break myself.

Id: [0x0024447C]
[&breath]Some break this is! Today feels just like old times. The job got harder than anticipated.

Id: [0x0024447E]
Once a mercenary, always a mercenary. It's a job you can never shake off.

Id: [0x0024447F]
Right you are. I'm learning that all the more now. Trouble goes, then comes back twice.

Id: [0x0024448B]
Yesterday I hit some swords with a hammer. Today I'm going to hit swords with a hammer. Tomorrow...

Id: [0x0024448C]
Something about swords and hammers?

Id: [0x0024448D]
No! Tomorrow I will dream of killing bears and lions. Of standing on a mountaintop. Go and live life and give me a story. Something to dream about while I... hit swords. With a hammer.

Id: [0x00244493]
That's it, then. Myrrine will want to know Kleon is dead.

Id: [0x002444A4]
Here's one of the priests. But no sign of the sapphires.

Id: [0x002444AC]
I'll wait.

Id: [0x002444B4]
This way, Kassandra! The <i>agoge</i> is up in the mountains. So we can train closer to Olympos!

Id: [0x002444BE]
Wouldn't it be faster to take a horse?

Id: [0x002444BF]
Hmm.

Id: [0x002444C0]
I want to own a legendary horse one day, like Helios's mighty stallions, Abraxas and Santana!

Id: [0x002444DC]
You. Someone was spotted going into your house. Guards were found dead outside. Tell me who you talked to, or I'll break your pretty face.

Id: [0x002444DD]
Please! I beg you! She forced me, I thought she would kill me.

Id: [0x002444DE]
She? <i>I</i> will kill you! What did you tell her?

Id: [0x002444E7]
Speak! Before I really give you something to cry about.

Id: [0x002444EF]
I wish I could do something, but if I reveal myself now this will all be for nothing.

Id: [0x002444F1]
Oh, yes?

Id: [0x002444F8]
Why is that?

Id: [0x002444F9]
Rumor has it that a ship they sunk was carrying a sword that never turned up in the wreckage. I suspect it's on the ocean floor now... Guarded by sharks and the remaining pirates.

Id: [0x002444FD]
I needed to save a double dose for my grandmother. I'll give it to her soon.

Id: [0x002444FE]
Sure. I'll just deliver the rest then.

Id: [0x00244500]
I've crushed the herbs so they'll be easier to take. Could you please bring them to my patients? Just tell them they're from me, Lykaon.

Id: [0x00244501]
I thought I brought you more herbs than this?

Id: [0x00244506]
One shell, delivered safe and sound to the Queen of the Sea.

Id: [0x00244507]
Your services are appreciated.

Id: [0x0024450E]
May you reach Hades safely.

Id: [0x00244513]
Another body safe from the fanatics.

Id: [0x00244518]
I hope this is the worst of it.

Id: [0x00244520]
Any trip that involves me diving into an underwater cave doubles the cost.

Id: [0x00244521]
I'm not sure what the better addition to my collection is, this shell, or the one holding it.

Id: [0x00244524]
So how many children do you have?

Id: [0x00244525]
Uh, no, none... but when I'm older I'm going to marry Athena, and we'll have the strongest sons!

Id: [0x00244526]
Well, then.

Id: [0x0024452A]
That's all of them.

Id: [0x00244531]
Come to think of it, I found a dead priest. He had a letter on him.

Id: [0x00244532]
Well slap me silly and call me Hermes! That's them all right. Any clues?

Id: [0x00244535]
They must be faltering by now.

Id: [0x00244536]
It said something about going to the Desphina Fort to sell their loot. I'll head that way.

Id: [0x00244618]
Let me know if you need anything else.

Id: [0x0024461D]
It's always a pleasure to have your drachmae jingling in my pouch, Xenia.

Id: [0x00244624]
I'm sure it'll suit you.

Id: [0x00244625]
Go then, kill the enemy command. This is our war to win.

Id: [0x00244626]
I have the seals. Spartan troops have the outpost.

Id: [0x0024462B]
Lykaon made this medicine for you.

Id: [0x0024462D]
Thanks! See, I take care of these beasts, and Lykaon takes care of me. Too bad nobody takes care of him, though.

Id: [0x0024462E]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0024462F]
His parents died young. His grandmother raised him but then... She was born under a cursed star. Never mind that, he's a good boy.

Id: [0x00244630]
I'm sure he is.

Id: [0x00244633]
That Lykaon sure had some bad breaks in life. Maybe that's why he tries so hard.

Id: [0x00244639]
These herbs are from Lykaon.

Id: [0x0024463B]
Oh thank you! That physician is so thoughtful and so handsome. It's too bad he's decided not to marry.

Id: [0x0024463C]
Why not?

Id: [0x0024463D]
He just told me some nonsense about not wanting to burden an innocent woman with his worries. Personally, I just wish he'd been honest and said I'm not his type.

Id: [0x0024463E]
I wonder why he'd say that.

Id: [0x00244641]
Lykaon is so handsome... but he worries too much.

Id: [0x0024464B]
Lykaon sends his regards.

Id: [0x0024464D]
The medicine he promised, thank you. Tell me, did he look well?

Id: [0x0024464E]
He didn't look sick to me.

Id: [0x0024464F]
I've seen him up and walking around at all hours, mumbling to himself. He seems worried. I should bring him some sweets to cheer him up.

Id: [0x00244650]
I'm sure he'd appreciate that.

Id: [0x00244653]
That man takes care of everyone but himself. Maybe that's why he's up all night worrying.

Id: [0x0024466C]
Just ignore her. Zeus will recognize his mistake in choosing a champion soon enough.

Id: [0x00244679]
Eagle Bearer! You touched my farm with your godly spirit, and the blight has left us.

Id: [0x00244685]
What does this have to do with me?

Id: [0x00244686]
I've learned of a powerful elixir, which if consumed will give someone the vigor and stamina of Eros. If you can gather me the ingredients, I can make it for my husband.

Id: [0x00244689]
Hello again! After our experience with the Trojan imitation, the other generals have taken to calling me Odysseus.

Id: [0x0024468E]
I'll come back when I finish delivering the medicine you gave me.

Id: [0x00244690]
Why do you bother me again, <i>misthios</i>? I've told you to pass my words on to my family. There is nothing else to say.

Id: [0x00244697]
I delivered all your medicine. Seems you have a lot of people concerned for your wellbeing.

Id: [0x00244698]
Thanks. Um, my grandmother Praxithea... I have to bring her the last of the medicine. Will you come along with me to her house? I think I need your help.

Id: [0x0024469B]
Thank you. All my patients are in or around the Chora of Delphi.

Id: [0x002446A5]
I'm sure I can find them.

Id: [0x002446A6]
Thanks. One patient should be at the animal pens in the west, one is building a house in the northeastern corner of the village, and one works in the fields to the south of the village.

Id: [0x002446AC]
It's difficult to tell if Odessa is in the wrong or not...

Id: [0x002446AD]
I was so happy when Odessa came home to me.

Id: [0x002446B5]
Thank you for helping Odessa and me. I'm starting to feel much better.

Id: [0x00244724]
The temple[2386631].

Id: [0x0024472D]
Ah! Here you are, and not a moment too soon.

Id: [0x00244732]
I've dealt with the bandits and gotten the wood for the bowyer.

Id: [0x00244733]
I had every confidence in you, my friend.

Id: [0x00244735]
The Cyclops is more important than a bowyer. We need to talk.

Id: [0x00244736]
Precisely what I was thinking! Let's hope Drucilla has a good sense of humor.

Id: [0x00244738]
Well? Your plan?

Id: [0x0024473A]
Right! The Cyclops and I have a score of drachmae to settle. The same score as <i>you</i>, my rough-and-tumble friend.

Id: [0x0024473B]
He wouldn't be after me if it wasn't for <i>you</i>, "my friend."

Id: [0x0024473C]
[laughs] Heh, heh. Right.

Id: [0x0024473D]
But - I swear - this will put an end to it! If he insists on sending his goons after us, we'll make sure his last good day was <i>yesterday</i>.

Id: [0x00244743]
Let's hear it then. What do I have to do?

Id: [0x00244744]
What will <i>we </i>do, you mean! As the brains to your brawn, I consider it a joint effort.

Id: [0x00244745]
Of course you do.

Id: [0x00244747]
It's not a war, it's a pissing match.

Id: [0x00244748]
You know just how to hurt me, Frederic.

Id: [0x00244749]
It's not that hard, trust me.

Id: [0x0024474B]
Think! What does the Cyclops value most? His men, his land, his ships? No. <i>His obsidian eye.</i>

Id: [0x0024474C]
Get to the point, Markos.

Id: [0x0024474E]
Oh, fine. [beat] We're going to <i>steal </i>it.

Id: [0x0024474F]
Are you crazy? You borrow his drachmae,<i> then </i>you steal his eye?

Id: [0x00244750]
Having it means we win. <i>Then,</i> it goes to market. We kill two birds with one obsidian eye!

Id: [0x00244752]
He'd better hold still, or he'll lose <i>both </i>eyes.

Id: [0x00244753]
No, <i>no</i>! It has to be done without the Cyclops <i>knowing. </i>You <i>cannot </i>be seen!

Id: [0x00244754]
Then my new bow will come in handy.

Id: [0x00244755]
He keeps the eye in his house - it's too valuable to wear out. A wise choice, until you show him the error of his ways. Wait for the sun to set, sneak in, and then! Bring me the eye.

Id: [0x0024475B]
I don't know where the Cyclops lives.

Id: [0x0024475C]
Keep to the west side of the island... There, you will find his lair.

Id: [0x0024475D]
Fine. But you won't get away with being cheap.

Id: [0x0024475E]
Cheap? You wound me, Frederic!

Id: [0x0024475F]
It's your defining trait.

Id: [0x00244760]
Bring me the eye, and I'll prove you wrong. Remember! Not a <i>soul </i>can see you!

Id: [0x00244761]
Got it.

Id: [0x00244762]
Pull this off, and our heads won't be the Cyclops's trophies when he comes back!

Id: [0x00244764]
Better be worth something.

Id: [0x00244765]
Do you know how much obsidian goes for on Kephallonia?

Id: [0x00244766]
I've never seen it.

Id: [0x00244767]
<i>Exactly. </i>And not only is it obsidian, it's veined with gold. <i>Gold</i>! It's no wonder he saves it for special occasions.

Id: [0x00244768]
So we'll use the profits to pay him off?

Id: [0x00244769]
It'll pay for the bulk of it - a vineyard's expensive, you know!

Id: [0x0024476C]
This will be <i>simple </i>for you. Sneak into the Cyclops's house, and steal me his eye! [Petty laugh]

Id: [0x00244773]
A blood trail. Not good.

Id: [0x00244782]
...I have no one.

Id: [0x00244789]
I'd say smashing some of his valuable wine, the stuff that gets me this drunk, would get him to come out and play.

Id: [0x0024478E]
Hey! This area is [belch]off limits!

Id: [0x002447B6]
You're pretty good in the arena, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002447B8]
Another glorious and bloody victory!

Id: [0x002447BA]
Good fight, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002447BF]
Oh my, Zeus… this is too easy!

Id: [0x002447C1]
When we first met, you said I could trust you. [beat]Thank you for trusting me.

Id: [0x002447C4]
When we first met, you said nobody could be trusted. I'll <i>never</i> believe that.

Id: [0x002447CD]
When we first met, you said nobody could be trusted.

Id: [0x002447CE]
When we first met, you said not all mercenaries were cutthroats. That I could trust you.

Id: [0x002447D0]
So trust me now.

Id: [0x002447D1]
You don't have to trust me. Just don't trust <i>him.</i>

Id: [0x002447EE]
Peaceful, isn't it?

Id: [0x002447EF]
It's what's we all hope to earn one day.

Id: [0x002447F1]
Once we're gone, our deeds must speak for themselves. They've defined us and our legacy. It's how we're remembered that matters most. [beat]How will you remember Skoura?

Id: [0x002447F2]
Peace and respect.

Id: [0x002447F3]
[beat]How do we truly earn those? Peace and respect.

Id: [0x002447FC]
He was a sad, broken old man who should've known better than to step foot in the arena with me.

Id: [0x002447FD]
The crowds never rest, <i>misthios</i>. Would you like to go back to the arena with me?

Id: [0x002447FF]
I'll remember him as he truly was, a Hero of the Arena. [beat]And a friend.

Id: [0x00244804]
No! No, no, no. I'm just uh, business associates with them. I work for the general.

Id: [0x00244805]
Tell me what your "business" is with the general, or I start removing your teeth one by one.

Id: [0x00244807]
<i>Maláka.</i> Fine!

Id: [0x00244808]
I help the -

Id: [0x0024480A]
How do you think the elite guards can do what they do? Their strength... it's not normal. Not natural!

Id: [0x00244813]
More like I'm being blackmailed -

Id: [0x00244814]
By the Cult of Kosmos to deliver them drunk athletes for their army. The good ones fetch more. Good ones like Neleus.

Id: [0x00244815]
They do something to the students... It makes them... different.

Id: [0x00244816]
No matter their strength, it pales in comparison to mine.

Id: [0x00244817]
They're definitely a rank above most soldiers, that's for sure.

Id: [0x00244818]
I've messed up, <i>misthios. </i>I couldn't defy them before, but -

Id: [0x00244819]
With you on my side, maybe we can turn this around.

Id: [0x0024481A]
The Cultists always took the drunk students from my docks to a cave[2376328] along the coast, south of here.

Id: [0x0024482F]
There might be redemption for you yet.

Id: [0x00244830]
The people of Thasos are my people after all, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00244831]
The Cultists may have lined my pockets, but my heart is empty. Save the students. Please. I can't do this anymore.

Id: [0x00244838]
Switching sides already? If I hadn't caught you, you'd still be slinking about in the shadows.

Id: [0x00244839]
They aren't going to forgive what happened to their guards in my house, and my life is worth more to me than drachmae. My loyalty is not to the Cult.

Id: [0x0024483A]
Or Thasos.

Id: [0x0024483B]
You're just thinking of yourself, trying to stay alive.

Id: [0x0024483C]
We're all reduced to that when our lives are truly in danger.

Id: [0x0024484C]
I hope you're right.

Id: [0x00244853]
We can be again. Skyros, and Euboea, and the Dagger... We can leave them all behind.

Id: [0x0024486C]
I don't blame you. I don't know what I would've done in your position. I think that's why he didn't tell me what he was planning. I would've tried to stop him.

Id: [0x0024486D]
I did try. And look where that got him.

Id: [0x0024486E]
Skoura was a true warrior. He deserves peace now. And respect.

Id: [0x00244870]
Save the students for Thasos, <i>misthios. </i>And -

Id: [0x00244871]
Cull the Cultists while you're at it. That's just good for everybody.

Id: [0x00244873]
I'll save the students for their own sake, not yours. If anything happens to Neleus, you're a dead man.

Id: [0x00244874]
Go to the students, they are in the cave[2376328] to the south. Follow the coast and you'll see it. Good luck.

Id: [0x00244881]
Stop stealing sips of it, idiot. You know what this wine does, right?

Id: [0x00244882]
But it's just so good. Maybe more of it will make us stronger?

Id: [0x00244883]
More of it will make you dead. You've seen the athletes in the armory -

Id: [0x00244884]
What damage could one more sip cause -

Id: [0x00244885]
We're supposed to be <i>protecting</i> the wine, not <i>drinking </i>it. <i>Stop.</i>

Id: [0x00244888]
I'm sure he'll be fine.

Id: [0x0024488C]
So, this is what's become of my brother? You've clawed your way back from Hades, back to <i>life, </i>only to take the lives of others?

Id: [0x0024488D]
Not from Hades, little Robin. From the ocean floor. Poseidon remained silent as I drowned. I saved me. ME. There are no gods - only mortals. Know that, and you'll know everything you need to rule this world.

Id: [0x0024488F]
Not everyone wants to rule the world. Some of us just want to live in it.

Id: [0x00244891]
Ah, a <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00244893]
Kingfisher.

Id: [0x00244895]
No! His name's <i>Neritos! </i>He's not just some codename you can cross off! He's my brother! He's <i>family!</i>

Id: [0x0024489C]
Family is all that matters.

Id: [0x0024489D]
Yes! Yes. No one has to die here.

Id: [0x0024489E]
Listen, brother. Please.

Id: [0x002448A0]
Family or not, that man is the head of the Dagger. He's caused a lot of suffering. For that, no one gets a pass.

Id: [0x002448A6]
...Not even <i>pater.</i>

Id: [0x002448A8]
I know the Cult's working in Euboea, Kingfisher. No doubt whispering in your ear, guiding the Dagger's blade.

Id: [0x002448A9]
You - how do you know the Cult? [beat, puts two and two together]By Zeus... you're her. The one they want.

Id: [0x002448AA]
The one they want, but can't stop. Even the Centaur of Euboea is dead.

Id: [0x002448AB]
No, that's... that's - the Cult will send someone else!

Id: [0x002448AE]
Let them. I don't lack for sharp objects to gut them with.

Id: [0x002448B1]
You've been a slave, brother. But the<i> world </i>is my slave. It's wonders. It's wine. It's people.

Id: [0x002448B3]
We could be masters together. [beat]We were always meant to fly, little Robin.

Id: [0x002448B8]
He's my brother! I can save him. I know I -

Id: [0x002448BE]
Klaudios. The King of Bandits. He's tricky. Deception is his trade...

Id: [0x002448C0]
Belos. The Beast of Sparta. Devours his enemies. They call him death...

Id: [0x002448D5]
You just want me to get the general off your back for failing him.

Id: [0x002448D6]
Happy coincidence, I guess.

Id: [0x002448D7]
It's a massive structure sitting on Lemnos in plain sight. I'm told that the best way to reach it is by boat.

Id: [0x002448E5]
This is your fault. These prisoners - they've had the tonic already.

Id: [0x002448E6]
Only one of them has had a bad reaction. The other one looks like he still stands a chance.

Id: [0x002448E8]
Then there's still hope for Neleus.

Id: [0x002448EA]
Looks like this was quite the reinforced hideout. The Cult are a bigger force to be reckoned with than I took them for.

Id: [0x002448EB]
With you leading the charge, we'll kill the general of the Cult guards. We can deliver them a crushing defeat here that reverberates across the Greek world.

Id: [0x002448EC]
Evanthe. The Huntress. Just when you think she's cornered, she stabs from the side...

Id: [0x002448FA]
You know him better than anyone.

Id: [0x002448FC]
Look around you, Agapios. Skyros is already drowning in blood! Neritos brought violence to Euboea's shores long ago. We're past negotiating.

Id: [0x00244901]
Rarghhh!!!

Id: [0x00244902]
<i>Misthios</i>, help! The tonic has driven him crazy!

Id: [0x00244909]
Titos. The Rock of Athens. Skilled soldier. Not to be discounted...

Id: [0x0024490F]
Vasilis. The King of the Arena. A Spartan braggart. But with the skills to back it up...

Id: [0x00244915]
Father chasing us...

Id: [0x00244916]
He couldn't catch little birds, so little birds we became.

Id: [0x00244919]
Then fly little Robin, fly.

Id: [0x00244922]
This must be the farm[2400032] Agapios mentioned. Now to find the farmer and see what he knows about the Dagger.

Id: [0x00244928]
And never return?

Id: [0x00244929]
<i>We can fly.</i>

Id: [0x0024492C]
I can't live in that world.

Id: [0x0024492E]
I trust <i>him</i>.

Id: [0x00244930]
That's a good question -

Id: [0x00244931]
Let me talk to her privately to be sure.

Id: [0x00244932]
I always preferred "The Kingfisher."

Id: [0x00244934]
You have <i>no right</i> to that name. That belonged to my brother... and he's dead.

Id: [0x00244935]
You have no one?! Who did I have?! I - I washed away, got lost at sea... But I found my way home. And what was there to welcome me? Father dead, and you... a slave. [&spit]A SLAVE!

Id: [0x00244937]
Perhaps you'd like to meet them?

Id: [0x0024493F]
So I <i>made </i>my own family. My brothers. The Dagger.

Id: [0x00244941]
Goodbye, brother.

Id: [0x00244943]
Isn't that right, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x00244948]
No! Idyia, my love. No! Wake up! Come on, wake up! Wake up...

Id: [0x0024494D]
Are you OK, Prexileos? How badly did they hurt you?!

Id: [0x0024494E]
I'm fine, my love. Are you -

Id: [0x0024494F]
Don't you worry about me when you're bleeding all over.

Id: [0x00244956]
Are the two of you -

Id: [0x00244957]
You could've gotten us all killed! What were you -

Id: [0x00244959]
She means "thank you."

Id: [0x0024495B]
You said something about the Dagger and Skyros.

Id: [0x0024495C]
That's where they carry out all their shady business, <i>misthios.</i> In the shadows of Skyros.

Id: [0x0024495D]
We risked our lives to tell you that, so make sure you deal with every last Dagger dog there is there.

Id: [0x0024495E]
If the Dagger have any more men like this crazy one, they can't be taken lightly.

Id: [0x0024495F]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Our family will be grateful to you.

Id: [0x00244960]
All the families of Euboea will be, too.

Id: [0x00244961]
Agapios will hear about what happened here. There will be justice.

Id: [0x00244963]
I will cull them all.

Id: [0x00244964]
That's a big ask. I can't promise you that.

Id: [0x00244965]
Well then, run back to Agapios and tell him what happened here. He'll see to it.

Id: [0x00244966]
You've seen what they can do, <i>misthios. </i>All we ask is you try.

Id: [0x00244967]
I'll do my best.

Id: [0x00244969]
Skyros! <i>Misthios</i>, get to Skyros! Tell Agapios!

Id: [0x0024496A]
That's where they control Euboea from! Stop them!

Id: [0x0024496B]
You little -

Id: [0x0024496F]
Skyros... Agapios needs to know about this.

Id: [0x00244974]
I won't let your dying words go to waste. Agapios will know about Skyros, and I will avenge the both of you.

Id: [0x00244977]
I'm in.

Id: [0x00244978]
If the information you uncovered is accurate, it won't just be the Kingfisher at the temple[2386631] - it's a gathering of the Dagger's leadership. You can wipe them all out and free Euboea from their control.

Id: [0x00244979]
Agapios will not allow his brother to be harmed.

Id: [0x0024497A]
I love Agapios, [beat]but Euboea must come first. When this is all over... I'll make sure your reward finds its way to your boat.

Id: [0x0024497C]
Euboea thanks you for your service.

Id: [0x00244BDD]
So what do you need?

Id: [0x00244BE2]
How long ago was that?

Id: [0x00244BE3]
Years ago. Many years ago.

Id: [0x00244BE4]
Will you see your daughter?

Id: [0x00244BE5]
My little Anaia. Yes. I think I'll see her.

Id: [0x00244BE8]
Where's Agapios?

Id: [0x00244BE9]
[&ah]We've spotted him up by the Temple[2386631], arguing with his brother.

Id: [0x00244BEA]
The Kingfisher.

Id: [0x00244BEC]
My men are engaging pockets of The Dagger's forces across Skyros, but we can't get up there.

Id: [0x00244BED]
And you think perhaps "The Hero of Euboea" can?

Id: [0x00244BEE]
Euboea needs your help. [beat]Agapios needs your help.

Id: [0x00244BF8]
We need you now more than ever. Please, help us finish the Dagger!

Id: [0x00244C4A]
Hmm... That was only one part of the stele. If we find the others, I can decipher the text.

Id: [0x00244C4B]
Maybe that will reveal more armor. The rest of the stele you speak of could be anywhere.

Id: [0x00244C4C]
Excellent! Now I need to see those markings. Let's go inside.

Id: [0x00244C50]
I'll find them and return as soon as I can.

Id: [0x00244C51]
You're all the same. Selfish, and fucking destructive.

Id: [0x00244C52]
It was different in the beginning. It wasn't about destruction, it was about redirection.

Id: [0x00244C54]
This is a lot to take in. [beat]But I know you had good intentions. I don't think you lied about that.

Id: [0x00244C55]
Never. [beat]I thought I could maintain control, but I overestimated myself. It just got away from me.

Id: [0x00244C56]
Telling me you're a Cultist took guts. You know what I do to Cultists, Aspasia.

Id: [0x00244C57]
I didn't want to lie to you anymore. Now that they're gone, we can work together. I think we'd make a good match, don't you?

Id: [0x00244C69]
Flower petals. These would have lined the offering box.

Id: [0x00244C70]
These ribbons tied the box shut.

Id: [0x00244C72]
This is crazy. It won't work, Aspasia. It <i>didn't </i>work.

Id: [0x00244C73]
It's not crazy, it's enlightened. Once people in Athens get wind of this, they'll come to know they've wanted it all along. Even you.

Id: [0x00244C78]
No! No! No more!

Id: [0x00244C7C]
[beat]I'm not sure.

Id: [0x00244C7D]
You've spent your whole life thinking for yourself. Let <i>go. </i>What I plan will require you to trust me.

Id: [0x00244C83]
You should go. Lead your "new republic."

Id: [0x00244C84]
[beat]I couldn't have done this without you, Kassandra. You're doing the right thing.

Id: [0x00244C87]
I can't let you do this. You've caused so much damage. You destroyed the Greek world.

Id: [0x00244C88]
You've proven you have no understanding of what we're doing. I misjudged you.

Id: [0x00244C89]
So did I.

Id: [0x00244C8C]
Hi Markos! [&Dying:arg-arg-arg]Arg[/&Dying], nice hat!

Id: [0x00244C8D]
Hi Markos! [&Laughs]Haha[/&Laughs], nice hat!

Id: [0x00244C8E]
Hi Markos! [&Laughs][[Laughs]][/&Laughs]Nice hat!

Id: [0x00244C8F]
Hi Markos! [&Laughs][[Laughs]][/&Laughs]nice hat!

Id: [0x00244C90]
Hi Markos! [&Snort][[Snort]][/&Snort][&Lol]nice hat

Id: [0x00244C95]
<i>Misthios</i>! Are you looking for work?

Id: [0x00244C97]
I won't be the leader. We need someone with the knowledge of a philosopher and the wisdom of a king.

Id: [0x00244C98]
That's a tall order these days.

Id: [0x00244C9B]
Then we're after the same thing.

Id: [0x00244C9F]
If you want something done, you'll have to do it yourself.

Id: [0x00244CA0]
[&laughs]You're right there. Can't trust the gods or their servants.

Id: [0x00244CA2]
I have faith in you.

Id: [0x00244CA3]
Hi Markos![exhale, small chuckle][&breath][&laughs]Nice hat!

Id: [0x00244CA4]
If someone is impious to the point of doing grave injustice to people as well as the gods, do they not deserve punishment?

Id: [0x00244CAB]
What did Praxithea do?

Id: [0x00244CAF]
Captain Gelon, of the Shark's Tooth.

Id: [0x00244CBA]
<i>Misthios</i>, you're back. [beat]And not a moment too soon.

Id: [0x00244CBB]
Who is this, Auxesia?

Id: [0x00244CBC]
This is the <i>misthios</i> who's going to reignite our spark, my love.

Id: [0x00244CBD]
Oh no! We've been through this, I can't satisfy you anymore. You're going to kill me with your lust.

Id: [0x00244CBE]
Nonsense. I'm going to make you an elixir that will give you the vigor of a man a fraction of your age.

Id: [0x00244CBF]
Gods save me. I cannot do this anymore.

Id: [0x00244CCD]
What a shame. We would have made you rich. [beat]Before we killed you.

Id: [0x00244CDA]
Don't take this personally, <i>misthios</i>. Your mother's the one we really want.

Id: [0x00244CDF]
They're not. But it will work, and that's what matters. We've already lost too many Athenians to those savages using "traditional" warfare.

Id: [0x00244CE0]
I wouldn't be fucking here if I knew, would I?

Id: [0x00244CE2]
[beat]Well, um, I sent my girl Gyke off. Pilgrims get stuck in the shallows 'round here, and, er, we sort of help out...

Id: [0x00244CE3]
Keep waiting. Gyke will come to you.

Id: [0x00244CE5]
That's not what I meant. What's your <i>personal</i> strategy?

Id: [0x00244CE6]
I've been a general in the army for a long time. I made some mistakes in my early days, but I more than made up for them after. Still, everyone attributes my victories to luck. Never to my own decisions.

Id: [0x00244CED]
Don't fight it. The Cult always gets what it wants. We already have Deimos. We'll find your mother, and you'll be dead.

Id: [0x00244CF2]
So, you sought the Oracle's advice?

Id: [0x00244CF3]
Her? [&scoff][scoff][/&scoff]Fuck no! I'd rather seek council in the wind from my ass.

Id: [0x00244CF4]
Then why seek her out?

Id: [0x00244CFB]
We got a deal. Suppose no harm in telling <i>you</i>. She lets me know where the pilgrims are coming from. Then I supply the transport for their journey, and we split the fee.

Id: [0x00244CFC]
So, you're trying to tell me the Oracle has divine intuition of where the pilgrims will be coming from.

Id: [0x00244CFD]
[&laughs]Fuck no! She asks her "believers" how full their ports are, then she tells me. Simple.

Id: [0x00244D00]
You have business here in Phokis?

Id: [0x00244D01]
I got business everywhere. Right now, it's where's my fucking ship.

Id: [0x00244D13]
I'm no fool, Lykaon. Your sister put Praxithea in great danger, and you've been asking me about killing. Do you want me to end her life?

Id: [0x00244D14]
No, it has to be me. I need to kill her.

Id: [0x00244D16]
Eh, yes. How did you know?

Id: [0x00244D17]
I've studied so many of your maps, I feel as if I know you.

Id: [0x00244D1E]
By all the gods, will someone just pay me? If I hear any more of this talk I'm going to be sick.

Id: [0x00244D1F]
Bah! Young people. They don't understand true love. Here, this should be more than enough.

Id: [0x00244D21]
My thanks.

Id: [0x00244D22]
Come, Koragos. I'll mix the elixir. You get the oils ready.

Id: [0x00244D25]
Your husband is tired. Allow <i>me</i> to satisfy your hunger.

Id: [0x00244D26]
I've never been with a mercenary before. Very well, let's see what you're made of.

Id: [0x00244D2B]
Did she... have fun?

Id: [0x00244D2C]
That should hold her for a few days at least.

Id: [0x00244D2D]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Here, take this as payment. You've more than earned it.

Id: [0x00244D30]
I don't need any payment. I'm just glad I could help.

Id: [0x00244D31]
You are too kind, <i>misthios</i>. The gods have truly blessed me by crossing our paths.

Id: [0x00244D32]
You two have fun... but not too much fun.

Id: [0x00244D35]
It was just a question. I'm here to help.

Id: [0x00244D36]
Oh, it's not your fault. After my business with the Oracle, I came to meet my ship and crew. That was a day ago, and they're nowhere to be found.

Id: [0x00244D37]
So who are you?

Id: [0x00244D39]
May Poseidon shower you with fortune for saving me.

Id: [0x00244D3A]
Thank you. You should be safe now.

Id: [0x00244D3E]
Elpenor has a lot of explaining to do.

Id: [0x00244D43]
We'll know soon enough, when you finish translating.

Id: [0x00244D44]
So where's the Shark's Tooth?

Id: [0x00244D45]
Oh. Your girl?

Id: [0x00244D46]
Yeah, best hand I ever had, and more. Look, find my ship and my Gyke, will you? I'll pay.

Id: [0x00244D47]
You've made questionable choices. But I think that was the right one.

Id: [0x00244D48]
You knew him. All he did was worry about the state of the Greek world. If I'd told him, it would have ruined him.

Id: [0x00244D4A]
The Dagger's looking for something and won't stop until they've found it.

Id: [0x00244D4C]
I don't see my Gyke, or my fucking ship. You're going to have to try harder if you want that drachmae.

Id: [0x00244D4E]
You're a pirate.

Id: [0x00244D4F]
What if I fucking am? I'm the pirate that's paying you. Anyway, I'm not a pirate all the time. It's more of a hobby.

Id: [0x00244D50]
A hobby! You sure the crew didn't mutiny and run off on you?

Id: [0x00244D51]
Not with my Gyke at the helm. Plus they never got the cut from our last trip. They wouldn't leave without getting paid.

Id: [0x00244D5B]
I found your ship.

Id: [0x00244D5C]
And? Come on now, where are they? Where's my Gyke?

Id: [0x00244D5D]
I don't really know how to tell you this.

Id: [0x00244D5E]
For fuck's sake, Zeus could have impregnated the whole of Athens in the time it takes you to say anything. Where are they?

Id: [0x00244D5F]
I was trying to break this to you gently... I found your ship. It was wrecked.

Id: [0x00244D60]
Oh... And my Gyke?

Id: [0x00244D61]
This was all I could find. It was her armband.

Id: [0x00244D65]
Suppose I'm not much of a captain now. Can't be a captain without a ship...

Id: [0x00244D69]
Of course.

Id: [0x00244D6C]
Now [beat]where's your <i>boat</i>?

Id: [0x00244D6D]
Ship. It's called the Adrestia.

Id: [0x00244D6E]
Whatever you say, captain.

Id: [0x00244D6F]
I can offer you a place on my crew. I know it's not like having your own ship, but you'll be part of a family.

Id: [0x00244D70]
Hmm, well I'd rather be at sea than stuck here with these pious idiots. You got yourself a deal... Just till I'm back on my feet.

Id: [0x00244D71]
I've found the final stele pieces. All of the armor has been found as well.

Id: [0x00244D72]
I can hardly contain myself. This will be life-changing, hero! Primordial gods, worth, inner vision! What can it all mean?

Id: [0x00244D77]
Besides, didn't you tell me something about hope?

Id: [0x00244D78]
You're a healer, Lykaon, not a killer. I am. You still have a hope of a better life beyond this.

Id: [0x00244D79]
No, Kassandra, I can -

Id: [0x00244D7A]
I'd best be on my way.

Id: [0x00244D7B]
You do that, <i>misthios.</i> You may not be the cause, but nonetheless, you're the bringer of ill fate. If I never see you or that fucking Oracle again, I'll count my blessings.

Id: [0x00244D7C]
More maps?

Id: [0x00244D7D]
How else would you find the bandits? Go on now, I want that shell.

Id: [0x00244D80]
This looks like the cove Gelon described, and there's a ship there too... or what's left of it.

Id: [0x00244D84]
This fits the description of Gyke's armband.

Id: [0x00244D87]
There's definitely more out there for you to see. Keep looking.

Id: [0x00244D88]
Well, there is some rumor of Poseidon that I'd like to pursue.

Id: [0x00244D89]
Take care, Eppie. I'm sure our paths will cross again.

Id: [0x00244D8A]
I hope so. Especially if I'm being attacked by something.

Id: [0x00244D8B]
I would like you to join my crew.

Id: [0x00244D8C]
Really! Will it require swimming? Because you know I can't swim. And what about horses? I don't think my backside can take it.

Id: [0x00244D8D]
We'll figure something out.

Id: [0x00244D92]
Looks like sharks got the whole crew.

Id: [0x00244D9D]
That's the Shark's Tooth, all right. Or what's left of her.

Id: [0x00244DA2]
I should tell Gelon about Gyke.

Id: [0x00244DB1]
[&breath]How do you do this? Decide who lives and who dies?

Id: [0x00244DB2]
How do <i>you</i> do it, Lykaon? All those lives depending on you, needing your healing and kindness.

Id: [0x00244DB3]
I... I think I need <i>you</i>, Kassandra. Not to kill anybody or find anything. Just to stay with me.

Id: [0x00244DB6]
I'm no healer, but I think you've been through a lot, Lykaon. You don't need a <i>misthios </i>in your life. Go back home and be the physician you're meant to be.

Id: [0x00244DBE]
Don't come back until you have the tablet.

Id: [0x00244DBF]
Yes, Polemarch.

Id: [0x00244DC1]
Lost something?

Id: [0x00244DC2]
Not lost, stolen.

Id: [0x00244DC4]
Stentor sent me, said you've been having trouble with spies.

Id: [0x00244DC5]
I'd take an Athenian spy over a Spartan traitor. Either way he must be found. He took a tablet with vital intelligence.

Id: [0x00244DC6]
Where's your spy? Is he still in the camp?

Id: [0x00244DC7]
Wouldn't need you if I knew.

Id: [0x00244DC8]
I doubt he's still here. Can't have gone far though, he was injured when he took out the guard.

Id: [0x00244DCF]
This doesn't sound like something a Spartan would do?

Id: [0x00244DD0]
He <i>could</i> be an imposter, we've had raids on our supplies recently... And Megaris has more mercenaries than a goat has ticks.

Id: [0x00244DD2]
And what man would turn their back on Sparta?

Id: [0x00244DD3]
I'll get him <i>and</i> your tablet.

Id: [0x00244DD5]
Whoever he is, I will make him pay for betraying Sparta.

Id: [0x00244DD6]
Misthios! If this man is a Spartan... take your time killing him.

Id: [0x00244DD7]
I'll get the tablet for you, and deal with the one responsible.

Id: [0x00244DDA]
This spy needs to be found. The information he stole is crucial to the war effort.

Id: [0x00244DDF]
Did you see which direction he went?

Id: [0x00244DE0]
The men said he went towards the hill, easier to avoid pursuit in that terrain.

Id: [0x00244DE1]
Anything you can tell me that might help?

Id: [0x00244DE2]
The area is hotly contested, but Sparta is winning. We're pushing the Athenians back, but due to the war the forests and mountains have become a hive for bandits and mercenaries.

Id: [0x00244DE3]
I mean about where your <i>spy</i> might have gone.

Id: [0x00244DE4]
He's injured, and there's a spring up there in the forest. If it was me I would have headed there.

Id: [0x00244DE5]
I'll be back soon with your tablet.

Id: [0x00244DE6]
The mountains and forest of Megaris are dangerous, and he surely didn't work alone.

Id: [0x00244DE7]
I'm more than capable of handling your spy. <i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00244E01]
The small shard I found on Elpenor is like nothing I've ever seen. Might come in handy.

Id: [0x00244E0A]
I can't stay forever. But for now, let me take care of you, healer.

Id: [0x00244E13]
Thanks for all your help, Kassandra. I guess I was the one who needed healing after all.

Id: [0x00244E81]
Athens is but a shade of what it was...

Id: [0x00244E86]
That's enough seals for the General.

Id: [0x00244E97]
We've lost ground.

Id: [0x00244E9C]
Go! Don't return until they've been disposed of.

Id: [0x00244EA5]
Targeting the fort commanders is proving very effective.

Id: [0x00244EA9]
I'm not ready yet.

Id: [0x00244EBA]
I have more of the enemy seals.

Id: [0x00244EBF]
Good enough.

Id: [0x00244EC4]
Fine. I'll kill more for you.

Id: [0x00244EC8]
No, General. It'll have to wait.

Id: [0x00244ECB]
Having you target the fort commanders will enable our troops to advance. Are you ready to take out more of them?

Id: [0x00244ECE]
Killing their commanders now will spare blood in the end.

Id: [0x00244ED5]
I dedicate myself to the will of Apollo, no lying this time. I accept his judgement.

Id: [0x00244ED6]
Why not just use me? I was in the palm of your hand.

Id: [0x00244ED7]
You made me optimistic, that you could help me bring down the Cult that had become so corrupt. And you did, albeit unknowingly.

Id: [0x00244EF5]
That should be enough to stoke the blacksmith's flame.

Id: [0x00244EFD]
Why not?

Id: [0x00244EFE]
Does there have to be a reason other than saying no?

Id: [0x00244F01]
Come with me. This future's not a dream.

Id: [0x00244F03]
Fair enough.

Id: [0x00244F10]
I've never heard of it.

Id: [0x00244F11]
Few have, thankfully. It's a precious metal from a time long before our own. It possesses many properties that Sargon finds [beat]appealing.

Id: [0x00244F12]
The Athenians seem unsure how to react.

Id: [0x00244F14]
<i>Misthios</i>, you have added greatly to my collection of wondrous art. If only I had a kindred spirit to enjoy them with. Maybe one day I'll find another as wild as Myrrine.

Id: [0x00244F19]
Kassandra, your presence makes the day hot and sultry. I know I can never own the West Wind, but it pleases me that I was able to tame it for a little while.

Id: [0x00244F1C]
What could have been in another life, my West Wind? I will always see the fire in your eyes reflected in the treasures you brought me. Farewell, Kassandra.

Id: [0x00244F24]
Bandits. Perfect.

Id: [0x00244F29]
Someone's already here. Doubt they'll be happy to see me.

Id: [0x00244F4C]
You'll gain it back.

Id: [0x00244F4D]
I'm the only one of our generals who can. The wealthy don't understand the ugly things desperation makes people do.

Id: [0x00244F53]
Who's this?

Id: [0x00244F57]
Maybe this one has the jewels!

Id: [0x00244F69]
Don't be ridiculous.

Id: [0x00244F6F]
Do you have a suggestion for our next bit of training?

Id: [0x00244F72]
I always try to do what's right.

Id: [0x00244F73]
You'll taste dirt and blood here. I'll force you to eat a thousand bitter lessons to harden you into the bronze shield your city needs.

Id: [0x00244F74]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x00244F76]
I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00244F77]
I suppose that means you trust me.

Id: [0x00244F78]
I... don't know what that means.

Id: [0x00244F79]
I'll tell you what it means. Love is a singular comfort, Kassandra. What comes next means harmony for everyone.

Id: [0x00244F81]
If you were to ask General Neon that, he'd tell you they were mindless brutes. That's half true. They have a base sort of cunning. It shouldn't be enough to withstand Athenian might. Assuming the other generals make intelligent decisions instead of stalling.

Id: [0x00244F82]
You do know I'm of Spartan birth?

Id: [0x00244F83]
Of course. [beat]I wish I had more say over our naval forces. What I could do to the Spartans then...

Id: [0x00244F8D]
That's all the seals for the General. Time to go back.

Id: [0x00245004]
Hey, step away from him, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00245005]
This doesn't concern you.

Id: [0x00245007]
We'll see about that!

Id: [0x0024500E]
In the face of danger, Theoros abandoned his shield and fled his duty.

Id: [0x0024500F]
This is... hard news. A blow upon my heart. I do not thank you for your words, but they needed to be heard.

Id: [0x00245010]
Makarios has started his training at the <i>agoge</i>. And who knows, maybe one day Theoros -

Id: [0x00245011]
I have but one son now, <i>misthios</i>. To other matters.

Id: [0x0024501C]
Hyah! Take that villainous culture, I will -

Id: [0x0024501D]
"<i>Vulture"! </i>You keep getting the line wrong!

Id: [0x0024501E]
It's not easy, OK!

Id: [0x0024501F]
We all have a lot of lines! Get it right!

Id: [0x00245021]
These lines are really boring.

Id: [0x00245022]
Shh! Don't let Idyia hear you.

Id: [0x0024503A]
Yes, yes, come look for me at the quarry after you've killed those men. I need to go, quickly. My pets are waiting!

Id: [0x0024503B]
Yes, yes, it'll take time for me to gather the ingredients. You might want to look around Thasos City first. I heard that strange things are happening there, yes, yes.

Id: [0x0024503F]
I hope Agapios hasn't done something stupid...

Id: [0x0024505D]
There are more of these workers than I thought. And some are sick... like Neleus.

Id: [0x00245061]
I should look for the Doctor at the mine[2230331] north of here.

Id: [0x0024506C]
There! Kill the meddling<i> misthios </i>and these lovebirds.

Id: [0x00245072]
Look at this, <i>misthios</i>! <i>Feel </i>it! Everything I've been collapses down into this moment. The war. My time in the arena. My daughter Anaia. And you. You, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00245073]
Are you okay, Prexileos? Did they -

Id: [0x00245074]
I'm fine, my love. I'm fine. Tell the [&cough]misthios... Tell the misthios everything Agapios wants to know.

Id: [0x00245075]
Oh, you know a lot about me, do you little Robin?

Id: [0x00245076]
I know who you were<i>. </i>My brother's not a killer.

Id: [0x00245077]
Then take a closer look. [beat, softer]We are not who we were.

Id: [0x0024507B]
There's the man with the eyepatch.

Id: [0x00245080]
They killed him! They killed him, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00245084]
The Dagger's base is in Skyros! They've been manipulating Euboea like this for too long.

Id: [0x00245085]
Agapios wants you to deal with them, right? So go there. Go to Skyros and slay every last one of them.

Id: [0x0024508D]
That man must be the one the Doctor mentioned. I'll deal with him.

Id: [0x0024508F]
You have my word, I will see to it they lie dead at my feet.

Id: [0x00245090]
Good. Avenge us, misthios - us and all of those who suffer in Euboea because of them.

Id: [0x00245092]
I will try, but this isn't going to be simple.

Id: [0x00245093]
<i>Try? </i>You have less backbone than I thought.

Id: [0x00245094]
Go to Agapios then. Tell him about Skyros. He'll do the right thing for us in Euboea.

Id: [0x0024509B]
We need more of the tonic! What is the commander doing?!

Id: [0x002450A2]
That bloody Doctor! I don't care what you fellas do to him as long as we get him to make more tonic, understood?

Id: [0x002450A7]
The Dagger is mine! The Greek world is mine! No one will take that from me. Not my brother and not you[&spit], misthios.

Id: [0x002450AA]
Agapios! You can't trust the Kingfisher. Think of what he's done to our people. Think of the lives he's ruined!

Id: [0x002450B6]
Agapios!

Id: [0x002450B7]
He's trying to get the Doctor to make it.

Id: [0x002450B8]
Not fast enough! We need more, way more!

Id: [0x002450B9]
But... but sir... He called us his pets...

Id: [0x002450BA]
What?! Pets?! Explain yourselves!

Id: [0x002450BF]
That's taken care of. Now, the Doctor mentioned strange things happening in the city[2400846]. I should look around.

Id: [0x002450C2]
<i>Misthios...</i>

Id: [0x002450C4]
Brother, no... No, don't do this!

Id: [0x002450D0]
Why are you doing this?!

Id: [0x002450D1]
I <i>found</i> a way. Thanks to you, I found a way to live again!

Id: [0x002450D2]
Indeed, your "pets" sent me.

Id: [0x002450DB]
The fights just aren't as good as they used to be.

Id: [0x002450DC]
What do you mean? There's more action nowadays! Less boring talking. More blood and guts. It's great!

Id: [0x002450DD]
I don't know. It's just not the same. I used to care so much more.

Id: [0x002450DE]
Boring!

Id: [0x002450E4]
No way! He'd get destroyed!

Id: [0x002450E5]
Are you stupid? You think Skoura could take Vasilis?!

Id: [0x002450E6]
He could. Back in his prime.

Id: [0x002450E7]
Yeah, but he isn't in his prime. He's a joke now. No one cares about Skoura anymore. They keep him around for a good story or two. Maybe.

Id: [0x002450E8]
Yeah... You're right...

Id: [0x002450EA]
You're hopeless!

Id: [0x002450EB]
No I'm not! Skoura's the best. Honor. Strength. He had it all.

Id: [0x002450EC]
Yeah, <i>had</i>. Even you could beat him in a fight nowadays.

Id: [0x002450F6]
This is going to be huge!

Id: [0x002450F7]
No one even knows who's actually fighting. It's a surprise.

Id: [0x002450F8]
But it's going to be huge! Skoura himself put the fight together. He wouldn't slap his name on just anything.

Id: [0x002450FA]
I got on the list! I'll be watching the big fight.

Id: [0x002450FB]
Great! You got me on there too, right?

Id: [0x002450FC]
[beat]Umm... no.

Id: [0x002450FD]
What?! This is going to be the biggest fight of all time!

Id: [0x002450FE]
I'm not made of drachmae.

Id: [0x00245106]
Congratulations, <i>misthios</i>! You've lived up to what Maion and I saw in you. You're destined for greatness.

Id: [0x0024510D]
Run their ships ashore!

Id: [0x00245112]
We'll not be outmaneuvered by the Athenians the way the Persians did to Leonidas.

Id: [0x00245116]
Prepare for battle! Seems you cowering dogs are not yet used to the smell of death.

Id: [0x0024511D]
This is a ship manifest. Elpenor's selling weapons to both Athens <i>and</i> Sparta. He wants this war to go on forever.

Id: [0x00245122]
A letter to Elpenor.

Id: [0x00245127]
Elpenor's looking for a woman. I wonder who he wants in his slimy grasp now.

Id: [0x0024512C]
Elpenor snuck away like a coward. I should investigate his house.

Id: [0x00245133]
His death should keep friends of Perikles safe.

Id: [0x00245135]
I will try. [heavy breathing][&breath]I can't.

Id: [0x00245136]
Breathe. Release the fear.

Id: [0x00245137]
[&breath]Yes. [calm breathing][&breath]I feel it.

Id: [0x00245138]
Good! Your shield is where you left it. Collect it on your way back to the <i>agoge</i>.

Id: [0x0024517A]
Not yet.

Id: [0x0024517B]
Come back when you do.

Id: [0x0024517D]
Thank you, my friend. I will! Please, tell my mother that her sons will do the family proud.

Id: [0x00245187]
Kassandra!

Id: [0x00245189]
Better than that.

Id: [0x0024518A]
None of our own generals could win this without me.

Id: [0x0024518E]
Understood.

Id: [0x00245192]
As you command, General.

Id: [0x00245195]
Theoros and his age-mate, Akamas, were on overnight watch when they encountered a group of bandits. I found Akamas's corpse, but Theoros's body was gone.

Id: [0x00245198]
Consider it done.

Id: [0x0024519D]
There you go!

Id: [0x0024519E]
Once more!

Id: [0x0024519F]
Again, but better!

Id: [0x002451A5]
I see. His death will be an inspiration to his brother to train all the harder. My gratitude, Eagle Bearer, for this news. And the bandits?

Id: [0x002451A6]
Dead and given to the crows.

Id: [0x002451A7]
Good. Now, to other matters.

Id: [0x002451AC]
Another slow day...

Id: [0x002451AD]
I hope he comes back soon.

Id: [0x002451B0]
Oh Phoibe, you led him right to me.

Id: [0x002451B1]
Gods willing, he'll find a way to endure and thrive. It is not easy to send one's heart into the world.

Id: [0x002451B2]
He's eager and bright. And he has Theoros there to guide and inspire him. They will support each other.

Id: [0x002451B7]
I'll take care of the fort commanders. That should help you regain a foothold.

Id: [0x002451BD]
Is it a big hurt or a little hurt?

Id: [0x002451BE]
Like three mouses. No, like four.

Id: [0x002451BF]
So a puppy-bite-sized hurt. Got it.

Id: [0x002451C1]
I dunno.

Id: [0x002451C2]
Well, does it hurt like a bear biting you, or a mouse?

Id: [0x002451C8]
Those two idiots know something.

Id: [0x002451CD]
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em all. Gods, oracles, and especially pi- [beat]sailors.

Id: [0x002451D5]
More dead commanders. More seals. I should return to General Demosthenes.

Id: [0x002451D9]
That's another set of seals finished. Time to return to the General.

Id: [0x002451DE]
I have met some treacherous people. None of them compare to Elpenor.

Id: [0x002451E5]
Kassandra! Get over here, you spineless jellyfish, you!

Id: [0x002451E9]
Wheeeeeee!

Id: [0x002451F1]
Everyone pays more than Markos. You're lucky <i>I</i> took all his crazy contracts.

I was a fast learner - he's a rotten cheat! I only accept the easy stuff now. I'm working as a watchman this very moment. A cushy job... most days.

Id: [0x002451FE]
I don’t believe you! Dead? How can my baby be dead?

Id: [0x002451FF]
I don’t know what to tell you! You were lucky he survived as long as he did. That - that fall was devastating.

Id: [0x00245200]
[&cry]My baby... My baby...[&cry]

Id: [0x00245202]
Listen, there’s nothing we can do for you anymore. You’d best be on your way. [beat]Praise Hera.

Id: [0x00245204]
[&cry]They’re gone. They’re both gone...

Id: [0x0024520C]
You’ll never rule these streets, you pig!

Id: [0x0024520E]
Oh, you bet your pretty face I will.

Id: [0x00245212]
Get your filthy hands –

Id: [0x00245214]
And when I do, I’ll rip your fucking head right off and send it to the Cult as proof.

Id: [0x0024521A]
I'm going to look under every rock, in every shadow, until I find and kill this vile serpent.

Id: [0x0024521C]
<i>Maláka</i>... I came to see if you needed help.

Id: [0x00245221]
If you ever see that dog Markos again, tell him you demand minimum wage!

Id: [0x00245223]
[&breath]OK. Sorry, been a bad day. I finished my business with the Oracle and was meant to meet my ship here. They're nowhere to be fucking found, and I been here since last night.

Id: [0x0024523A]
That's a big hit!

Id: [0x0024523D]
That one had to hurt!

Id: [0x00245240]
I'm glad I'm not in there!

Id: [0x00245243]
This is a fight you'll talk about for a long time!

Id: [0x00245246]
A big hit!

Id: [0x00245249]
I don't know how they're still standing!

Id: [0x0024524C]
Wow!

Id: [0x0024524F]
Just like that!

Id: [0x00245252]
That's how you do it!

Id: [0x00245255]
Another big hit!

Id: [0x00245258]
What a fight!

Id: [0x0024525B]
It's not over yet!

Id: [0x0024525E]
They'll feel that one long after this fight.

Id: [0x00245261]
Just one mistake can change everything!

Id: [0x00245264]
By the gods!

Id: [0x0024526C]
I’m leaving soon.

Id: [0x0024526E]
Keos is your home.

Id: [0x00245270]
But this isn’t my true calling - my purpose.

Id: [0x00245272]
You might never find what you are looking for, Phoenix.

Id: [0x00245274]
I can’t stop until I do.

Id: [0x00245276]
You are a great pirate.

Id: [0x00245278]
And you are an even greater friend. Don’t forget me.

Id: [0x0024527A]
The text refers to worth, inner vision, and the primordial gods. How that all relates to a ritual, we don't know.

Id: [0x0024527B]
Tell me what we know so far.

Id: [0x0024527F]
That's all of the seals General Demosthenes requested. Time to head back.

Id: [0x00245291]
Stop! Please stop!

Id: [0x00245293]
We're well-positioned for battle. Troops have been deployed and will control more ground soon. Your efforts were invaluable. I won't forget it.

Id: [0x00245294]
Thank you, General.

Id: [0x002452A0]
Please <i>misthios</i>, bring me the sword. Who knows when I'll break these ropes and tear my poor parents to pieces.

Id: [0x002452A3]
<i>Misthios</i>! Have you changed your mind? Will you bring the sword and shield to my parents? It's the only way to stop the prophecy!

Id: [0x002452A5]
Who is this farm owner?

Id: [0x002452A6]
Lanike runs the farm for her family. Recently, it has been underperforming. She blames the gods and believes the land is cursed. But I wonder if she's too quick to punish her helots.

Id: [0x002452AC]
I'll do it, General.

Id: [0x002452AD]
What does Zita need?

Id: [0x002452AE]
Her daughter, Zopheras, is as wild and headstrong as an untamed filly. Zita constantly prays for guidance, but I suspect Zopheras needs a more grounded hand to direct her.

Id: [0x002452B2]
What should I know about Damia?

Id: [0x002452B3]
She has two precocious children who rule the roost in the agora. They reduce their tutors to tears and stir up their other age-mates. She is hoping you can instill some respect in them.

Id: [0x002452BD]
Spartan generals think me vain now. Wait until the gods crown me in bronze.

Id: [0x002452C0]
Another battle is all I want. Then I'll starve the Athenians into surrender.

Id: [0x002452C3]
Enough. Leave me.

Id: [0x002452C7]
What can you tell me about Zeuxo?

Id: [0x002452C8]
Her husband is off training for war, and she specifically requested an audience with you for help with something quite personal.

Id: [0x002452D1]
Minotaur tours! Get your Minotaur tours here!  Learn how to defeat the mighty Minotaur! Slay the beast with this one weird trick all minotaurs hate!

Id: [0x002452D2]
Book your tour now to avoid the disappointment of staring up at your own headless body while the Minotaur laughs at you - even he thinks the tour's great value for drachmae!

Id: [0x002452D3]
Take the Minotaur tour to avoid bringing shame and dishonor to your parents. [as Husband Talking to Wife]"Wife, I heard our child went off to slay the Minotaur! Have they returned victoriously yet?"

Id: [0x002452D4]
[as Wife Talking to Husband]"No Husband, they didn't take a handsome young man's very reasonably priced tour and were tragically killed. We're laughing stocks at the agora. We never should've had kids."

Id: [0x002452D5]
Is this what you want your parents to say, hero? Is it? No?! Then sign up now for my Minotaur Tour now!

Id: [0x002452DE]
Stay close! You don't want to miss a thing, warrior.

Id: [0x002452E3]
Hey, hero! The secrets of the Minotaur are <i>THIS</i> way!

Id: [0x002452E9]
Look out, that rock's actually a Minotaur dropping. He must have just been through here!

Id: [0x002452EA]
I can't believe we missed him!

Id: [0x002452F7]
At night, if you listen closely you can hear the faint sounds of the Minotaur snoring.

Id: [0x002452FE]
It's a little known fact that Theseus was left-handed.

Id: [0x00245305]
<i>And</i> that concludes our tour today, ladies and gentleman. Don't forget to tip your tour guide. [beat]That's me. Don't forget to tip me.

Id: [0x0024530B]
As you can see from the statues, the Minotaur is a fearsome foe - so don't forget this exclusive tour tip: [dramatic pause]He hates being stabbed! Particularly with sharp objects. [conspiratorial]They say it's his only weakness...!

Id: [0x00245315]
I'm pretty sure it was Sokrates who said: "The mind is the best weapon." Come with me, warrior! Keep your weapon sharp!

Id: [0x0024531B]
You're pretty easily distracted for a warrior...

Id: [0x00245320]
Here's another helpful tip you won't get on any other tour - the Minotaur... isn't a morning person!

Id: [0x00245321]
[beat]Trust me, I know my Minotaurs - I've been in this business 27 years. Just between you and me, I'm kinda hoping my boy, Arsenios Jr., takes over some day. Good kid, goooood kid.

Id: [0x00245326]
Don't trust the fish merchant! He's been cursed by the Gods to smell like <i>fish!</i>

Id: [0x00245328]
That's the<i> fish, </i>you half-wit! My hands smell wonderful!

Id: [0x0024532A]
I'll find them and see what they want of me.

Id: [0x0024532B]
May the Dioskouri watch over your path.

Id: [0x00245335]
I'm not saying I'm responsible for breaking the Minotaur statue, but I'm also not saying I'm <i>not </i>responsible.

Id: [0x0024533B]
Don't damage her gear! We can get a good price for it. She's basically walking drachmae!

Id: [0x0024534D]
5 drachmae says he jumps.

Id: [0x0024534E]
25 says he doesn't.

Id: [0x00245355]
How long's he been up there?

Id: [0x00245356]
Three, maybe 4 days?

Id: [0x00245357]
Should we get him water, or...? [beat]How long have <i>you</i> been here watching him?!

Id: [0x00245358]
Like I said, 3, maybe 4 days?

Id: [0x0024535F]
Come down from there!

Id: [0x00245366]
Don't be a fool! Think of your mater! [beat]And if that makes you want to jump more... Maybe think of something else!

Id: [0x0024536D]
Athena, give him strength...! [calling out]Please, just come down!

Id: [0x00245374]
It's not safe up there! Come down and fight the Minotaur!

Id: [0x0024537B]
Why's he up there?

Id: [0x0024537C]
I heard he fell in love with the Minotaur, who rejected his advances - and his broken heart drove him to madness.

Id: [0x0024537D]
Really? I heard he just wanted to get a really good view of Lato, and forgot how to get down.

Id: [0x00245384]
Someone help him!

Id: [0x00245394]
Please, Eros. Let it be me. Let him pick me!

Id: [0x00245395]
I got here first, back off! The scion will pick <i>me!</i>

Id: [0x00245399]
Of course. Where should I look?

Id: [0x0024539D]
There has to be some proof around here.

Id: [0x0024539F]
The sausage seller was <i>my</i> idea!

Id: [0x002453BA]
This is some strong stuff.

Id: [0x002453BB]
Save that wine for Xenia!

Id: [0x002453BC]
I'm just pinching a little bit, she'll never know.

Id: [0x002453BD]
If she did, you're as good as dead.

Id: [0x002453C2]
Have you heard of that pirate woman, Xenia?

Id: [0x002453C3]
<i>Maláka</i>. She's bad news.

Id: [0x002453C4]
I know, that's why I'm bringing it up! What if she, I don't know, has plans for these mushrooms that just came in?

Id: [0x002453C5]
What does a pirate need with mushrooms?!

Id: [0x002453C6]
I heard they can be made into weapons! Or a poison, I can't remember.

Id: [0x002453C7]
Just shut up.

Id: [0x002453CF]
Look who has returned.

Id: [0x002453D0]
<i>Misthios</i>! We're over here!

Id: [0x002453D3]
By the gods, woman, I said spare me the details.

Id: [0x002453D4]
I wasn't expecting a tough-looking mercenary to be so squeamish about a little fun.

Id: [0x002453D6]
I hope I'm as feisty as you at your age.

Id: [0x002453D7]
I'm <i>feistier</i> now than I've ever been.

Id: [0x002453DB]
Then maybe this will help with that ritual.

Id: [0x002453E1]
I've decided! I'd always sidelined you growing up, but now my heart knows you are the one for me. We will be happy together, I know it.

Id: [0x002453E2]
Yes, Aetios. Yes... We will be. I will protect our happiness at any cost.

Id: [0x002453ED]
Then I will... I will... gather my... what was it again? Oh yes... sausages!

Id: [0x002453EF]
Mmm... sausages...

Id: [0x002453F1]
Let me tell you a secret... It's a good one... I uh... I forget.

Id: [0x002453F3]
Listen to me... I love you. I do.

Id: [0x00245400]
Agapios's life and the fate of Euboea are in your hands now. Go!

Id: [0x00245406]
Yes, yes, if you've got important business, speak to my assistant, Agapios. He's probably near the Chalkis Warehouse.

Id: [0x0024540C]
Euneas couldn't have been taken far from here. I'll need your help, Ikaros.

Id: [0x00245431]
Did I hear 5,000 drachmae?! That's a steal, folks! A steal! You, sir! You're clearly a man of great wealth and taste - for a mere 5,000 drachmae, think of the life - the comfort - this slave would afford you!

Id: [0x00245433]
4,500.

Id: [0x00245434]
Sold!

Id: [0x0024543B]
2,000 drachmae?! Surely they're worth another 500 drachmae?!

Id: [0x0024543C]
2,500!

Id: [0x0024543D]
3,000! <i>3,000!</i>

Id: [0x00245445]
Not only is life easier and safer with a slave, it's <i>more rewarding! </i>You're not just purchasing highly skilled workers, you're purchasing <i>family!</i>

Id: [0x0024544C]
These slaves are local - straight from Eretria! They're experienced workers, formerly part of the rebuild happening right now. They could be yours! Don't let their skills go waste! We start the bidding at 500 drachmae per slave!

Id: [0x00245453]
You're busy people, doing your best to keep up in today's relentless world. With a slave to call your own, you'll have the advantage you need to get ahead!

Id: [0x0024545A]
Surely they're worth 1,500 drachmae!

Id: [0x0024545B]
...1,200?

Id: [0x0024545C]
Sir, this is a set - you get husband and wife together!

Id: [0x0024545D]
[beat]1,250.

Id: [0x0024545E]
Deal!

Id: [0x00245465]
But can they read? Write?

Id: [0x00245466]
Well, uh, one can!

Id: [0x00245467]
Really?

Id: [0x00245468]
...Yes!

Id: [0x00245469]
300 drachmae for the lot.

Id: [0x0024546A]
Sold!

Id: [0x00245472]
500 drachmae!

Id: [0x00245473]
510!

Id: [0x00245474]
515!

Id: [0x00245475]
Please, please, these aren't legless goats - these are strong, educated, and quite willing workers.

Id: [0x00245477]
520.

Id: [0x00245478]
Sold!

Id: [0x00245480]
Do these look like <i>Pephkan </i>slaves to you?! [beat, calmer]250 drachmae, minimum.

Id: [0x00245486]
Please, don't interrupt the bidding.

Id: [0x0024548B]
You're breaking my flow!

Id: [0x00245492]
Here we have slaves whose homes have been ravaged by the hubris of Sparta and Athens. Who will start the bidding?

Id: [0x00245498]
I-I'm sorry, you're covered in scars. I'd just rather be... someone else's slave.

Id: [0x0024549E]
You're not buying me... are you?

Id: [0x002454A5]
It feels like I've lived my whole life in this market[2413113]. [beat]Why does no one want me?

Id: [0x002454AB]
Better a slave here than homeless in Lesbos. That place is [beat]terrifying.

Id: [0x002454B1]
I just hope I go to a good home.

Id: [0x002454B7]
I'll get back to Thasos, one day.

Id: [0x002454BF]
How much for the pair?

Id: [0x002454C0]
2,500 drachmae.

Id: [0x002454C1]
1,000 for the shorter one.

Id: [0x002454C3]
Please, don't separate us. He's my little brother. He needs me. He can work. I promise he can work.

Id: [0x002454C5]
2,000 for the pair?

Id: [0x002454C6]
No, just the short one.

Id: [0x002454CE]
Do I hear 750 drachmae? Only 750 drachmae! You'll never get a deal this good in Athens!

Id: [0x002454D6]
Come see the finest slaves this side of the Acropolis!

Id: [0x002454D8]
I got what you asked for.

Id: [0x002454D9]
They're dead, all right? And your ship's gone, too.

Id: [0x002454DC]
[&breath]My Gyke...

Id: [0x002454DE]
All I found is her armband.

Id: [0x002454E2]
And you savor your youth! Don't become a washed-up seadog like me.

Id: [0x002454F7]
Gyke.

Id: [0x002454FF]
What's your interest in the shipwreck[2105455]?

Id: [0x00245500]
Interest? No, I have no -

Id: [0x00245503]
Don't lie to me!

Id: [0x00245509]
We've seen you watching us.

Id: [0x0024550A]
Tell me why!

Id: [0x00245510]
Help! Somebody help me!

Id: [0x00245515]
Kill them. Kill them all!

Id: [0x0024551E]
Demosthenes.

Id: [0x0024551F]
I'm not a murderer, if that's what you expected.

Id: [0x00245520]
I <i>expected</i> you were someone who wants to get paid. Was I wrong?

Id: [0x00245521]
No... not completely. [beat]Fine. What do you want?

Id: [0x00245528]
This leaves only one more to go. And then the ritual will be activated.

Id: [0x00245529]
Whatever that means.

Id: [0x0024552A]
Are you ready?

Id: [0x00245541]
What do they want to do?

Id: [0x00245542]
They want "honorable" face-to-face warfare, pitting our forces directly against the Spartans.

Id: [0x00245543]
I'm guessing you're about to tell me.

Id: [0x00245544]
Odysseus. He used his wits to triumph. Wily Odysseus, they call him.

Id: [0x00245615]
You think Odysseus had to take care of his sick father?

Id: [0x00245617]
If I hope to be remembered, I can't stay in one place like this. Stop standing around, and do what I've told you.

Id: [0x0024561C]
I see how that could be frustrating.

Id: [0x0024561D]
Other men take credit for my victories. Cautious men who cause needless deaths by overlooking opportunities. You know what happens to a General who loses his reputation? Who gets blamed for the loss of Athenian lives?

Id: [0x0024561E]
Nothing good.

Id: [0x0024561F]
He dies. So I will do everything to preserve Athenian lives. Maybe one day, I'll even get credit for my accomplishments.

Id: [0x00245628]
Ah, Thasos. It's been so long since I've seen my nephew, Neleus. I bet he's grown a quite a bit.

Id: [0x0024562D]
The Eagle Bearer?

Id: [0x0024562E]
<i>Misthios</i>! Over here, I need to talk to you!

Id: [0x00245633]
This better not be another of Neleus's pranks.

Id: [0x00245634]
He can't be as bad as you're making him sound.

Id: [0x00245635]
Bad?! He once stole <i>all</i> of the wine meant for a festival to Poseidon. Barrels of it. Incredible! When we opened them, sea water poured out.

Id: [0x00245636]
Oh. That is bad.

Id: [0x00245637]
Ah! And it gets worse. He stumbled out into the middle of the festival, as drunk as a fish is wet, and declared it was a sign from Poseidon. <i>Malákas</i> Neleus.

Id: [0x00245648]
Ha, never gets old.

Id: [0x0024564B]
Ooh. What was it?

Id: [0x0024564C]
The Oracle said Akrisios would be killed by his grandson, but Danae was unmarried and childless at the time. To protect himself, he locked Danae in a bronze room, open only to the sky.

Id: [0x0024564D]
I knew it!

Id: [0x00245652]
That's him. The man the theater couple wants me to deal with.

Id: [0x00245656]
How long has it been since you've watched a fight?

Id: [0x00245657]
A <i>long</i> time. But I'm glad I went back in. You've stirred feelings in me I thought to be long dead.

Id: [0x0024565C]
Looks like Mikkos was right. There <i>is</i> something going on here. I'll get to the bottom of this.

Id: [0x00245661]
The <i>misthios</i>! Get her!

Id: [0x00245665]
Lucky them! Did the gods help?

Id: [0x00245669]
Good for you.

Id: [0x0024566A]
Except swim.

Id: [0x0024566B]
Or be just!

Id: [0x0024566D]
I shouldn't have encouraged the villagers to fight. They're all dead now.

Id: [0x00245675]
That boat, it's...

Id: [0x00245677]
...It's preparing to attack! Get ready for a fight!

Id: [0x00245680]
Kristos, that's your job!

Id: [0x00245681]
I would keep the stinky king from marrying you!

Id: [0x00245685]
The villagers won't have to worry about these Cult guards again.

Id: [0x00245688]
That's no pirate ship... It's the<i> Cult!</i>

Id: [0x0024568A]
Battle stations!

Id: [0x0024568B]
They're coming from Skyros. Of course the <i>malákas </i>Cult's involved with the Dagger...

Id: [0x00245693]
It's the Cult.

Id: [0x00245694]
They mean to keep us from Neleus.

Id: [0x00245695]
Don't worry, Barnabas. We'll sink them.

Id: [0x00245696]
With you at the helm? Ah, yes, the Cult is doomed.

Id: [0x00245698]
Polydektes knew that Medusa would be Perseus's death...

Id: [0x00245699]
That stinker!

Id: [0x0024569A]
YES!

Id: [0x0024569C]
I did.

Id: [0x0024569D]
What was that like?

Id: [0x0024569E]
Hard. The Persians were a formidable enemy. They had the numbers. They had warriors from untold conquered lands in their armies. It took a united Greek world to turn them back. Anything less would have been total defeat.

Id: [0x002456A1]
Is this a kissing story?

Id: [0x002456A2]
Relax, I'm just setting it up. Soon Sarra gave birth to a child, the half-blood hero Perseus!

Id: [0x002456A3]
I don't know that riddle.

Id: [0x002456A4]
It's too hard.

Id: [0x002456A5]
Uh, it was hard for Perseus, too. But eventually he figured it out.

Id: [0x002456A6]
How?

Id: [0x002456A7]
He just did is all!

Id: [0x002456A8]
Ew!

Id: [0x002456A9]
Ew!

Id: [0x002456AA]
He grabbed the golden fleece and wrapped the Catoblepas's head in it, then flew back home astride winged Pegasos to save Andromeda, who was about to be eaten by the Kraken! He used the deadly head to turn the Kraken to stone.

Id: [0x002456AB]
Uh, it was just here when I woke up.

Id: [0x002456AC]
A reward, for all your help.

Id: [0x002456B1]
I'm going to wipe these Cult guards off of Lemnos once and for all.

Id: [0x002456B2]
It will be one more incredible stanza in the epic poem about your life.

Id: [0x002456B3]
And they have it coming.

Id: [0x002456B8]
Now's my chance to take this stronghold[2408133].

Id: [0x002456BD]
The Cult guard general. His time has come.

Id: [0x002456C4]
Got space for another? Make a little rooom!

Id: [0x002456C5]
[then, stern]I <i>can </i>save him. Please, master, <i>misthios</i>, there's no need for violence.

Id: [0x002456CA]
Agapios, my friend. You lived as a slave [beat]but now you're free.

Id: [0x002456D6]
<i>Chaire</i>, [beat, meaning it]Hero of Euboea.

Id: [0x002456D8]
Agapios, my oldest friend... I never should have let you go. Why did I let you go...?

Id: [0x002456DA]
You gave Agapios a great gift. He got to be free [beat]for a moment.

Id: [0x002456DB]
"A moment." [&ah]I suppose that's all any of us ever gets.

Id: [0x002456E0]
You never should have let him chase after his brother. That was a death sentence! You were his master, his <i>friend! </i>It was your duty to <i>protect </i>him!

Id: [0x002456E1]
I know! I know. [beat]I have no sons, <i>misthios. </i>No daughters. Agapios was all the family I had.

Id: [0x002456E3]
With the Kingfisher dead and his lieutenants crushed, the Dagger's done. Euboea's free thanks to you.

Id: [0x002456E4]
I hope it was worth the price.

Id: [0x002456E6]
It's freedom. It's always worth the price.

Id: [0x002456ED]
Shove off.

Id: [0x002456F7]
Is that all you got?

Id: [0x00245701]
I'll poke you hard!

Id: [0x0024570A]
Bam!

Id: [0x0024570F]
Don't hit too hard, the <i>misthios</i> might cry!

Id: [0x00245715]
Is this what a champion is made of?

Id: [0x0024571B]
That must be the man mentioned in the letter about arena fighting... Maion.

Id: [0x00245722]
Child's play!

Id: [0x00245728]
Show me your loyalty!

Id: [0x00245731]
How dare you challenge me?

Id: [0x0024573A]
My students! My pride!

Id: [0x0024573F]
Your brother -

Id: [0x00245740]
He made a choice. Years ago. Greed, power... If that's what freedom looks like, I'm better off a slave.

Id: [0x00245742]
You're <i>not </i>a slave, Agapios.

Id: [0x00245743]
Free?! No - I <i>abandoned </i>you to look for my brother. I should be put to a miserable death or, or -

Id: [0x00245744]
You performed a great service for Euboea today. [beat]You've been doing that for years, my friend.

Id: [0x00245745]
Master, I don't deserve this...

Id: [0x00245750]
For the master!

Id: [0x00245759]
Weak! Get out of our school[2400848]!

Id: [0x00245762]
You're unworthy!

Id: [0x00245769]
I must not fail my students, not anymore.

Id: [0x00245779]
I've failed my students. I'm unworthy.

Id: [0x0024577B]
You're free.

Id: [0x0024577C]
You've worked, and fought, and sacrificed for your nation. [beat]Take a <i>malákas </i>reward when it's offered to you!

Id: [0x0024577E]
[&laughs]Yes, sound advice, misthios. Then let my first step as a free man be this - I will remain in Euboea. She needs me, [beat]and I need her.

Id: [0x00245787]
You're not allowed here.

Id: [0x00245791]
Go away.

Id: [0x0024579B]
Want to lose some teeth? No? Then move on.

Id: [0x002457A5]
Leave this place, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002457A7]
With the Kingfisher... removed and the Dagger's leadership eliminated, Euboea is safe. That's not something we'll forget. Thank you, [beat, meaning it]Hero of Euboea.

Id: [0x002457AE]
Stay back.

Id: [0x002457AF]
They seem drawn to this place. I hadn't expected that.

Id: [0x002457BA]
Are you all right? [&laughs]Alexios, you're alive.

Id: [0x002457BB]
Don't touch me.

Id: [0x002457BC]
[&laughs]Come on, little brother. You have to tell me everything. What's happened to you?

Id: [0x002457C4]
You're not alone, Layla. We're monitoring your progress. You're doing fine.

Id: [0x002457C5]
Are you all still reading me? It's awfully quiet on comms.

Id: [0x002457C6]
Yeah, we're here if you need us!

Id: [0x002457C7]
Said the assassin sitting at a desk.

Id: [0x002457CB]
Strong enough to...?

Id: [0x002457CC]
Strong enough to carry this basket to my husband, Kalibos.

Id: [0x002457CD]
Oh. Right. The magistrate mentioned you.

Id: [0x002457CF]
We hear you, Layla.

Id: [0x002457D0]
Thanks. It's just so... silent down here.

Id: [0x002457D2]
Well I don't have to be on a boat to be useful! I have loads of information on Ancient Greece. Did you know that at Zakros, the Minoans built a graveyard so huge it was known as the "Ravine of the Dead"?

Id: [0x002457D5]
Please, <i>misthios</i>... I owe my neighbor a great debt, but I can't afford to pay it.

Id: [0x002457DB]
These are trying times. Maybe you can reach a compromise?

Id: [0x002457DC]
No. The <i>malákas</i> keeps a ledger recording my debt. This debt will follow me... and my children!

Id: [0x002457DE]
Then you shouldn't have borrowed more than you could afford.

Id: [0x002457DF]
What? Have you no heart for those in need?

Id: [0x002457E0]
You look wealthy enough to me.

Id: [0x002457E1]
I might've guessed a wretched <i>misthios</i> wouldn't be tricked so easily. But I'll have your coin anyway!

Id: [0x002457E9]
I wondered where that'd got to.

Id: [0x002457EE]
A fine selection.

Id: [0x002457F4]
That's a good one, I can tell.

Id: [0x002457F9]
A Spartan ship? Could Euneas have crashed here?

Id: [0x00245822]
How wondrous.

Id: [0x0024582A]
I wonder why they were separated on purpose.

Id: [0x00245A73]
The Athenians are here! Spartans, charge!

Id: [0x00245A78]
Should prove useful.

Id: [0x00245A81]
Nice view. And there's the Desphina Fort to the south.

Id: [0x00245A86]
You can't go wrong with that.

Id: [0x00245A8B]
An excellent choice.

Id: [0x00245A90]
I'm sure you'll find a use for that.

Id: [0x00245A95]
The Athenian camp is ahead. Destroy it all!

Id: [0x00245A9A]
An interesting find.

Id: [0x00245A9F]
How [beat]interesting.

Id: [0x00245AA5]
What! You dare?! Xanthe said you were an agent of Zeus, but you are a false champion as godless as my helots. Get out from here!

Id: [0x00245AA8]
Ugh, this is heavy. What's in here, bricks?

Id: [0x00245AB0]
Yes! You see how they mistreat me and disrespect me? They don't know how good they've got it. I'm glad you were able to strike a modicum of fear and respect into them.

Id: [0x00245B2F]
[&gasp]If that's what you think, Alexios, you must've hit your head on the way down.

Id: [0x00245B30]
I've heard the story, and not from a liar like you. And <i>never</i> call me Alexios.

Id: [0x00245B32]
You think it's that simple? Come on, Alexios. Let's talk about it.

Id: [0x00245B33]
Stop calling me that. I already know what happened that night.

Id: [0x00245B35]
The poison in your fields is nothing compared to the poison in your heart.

Id: [0x00245B36]
My brother was also imprisoned by soldiers, but he's innocent. Power-hungry <i>malákes</i>!

Id: [0x00245B37]
What happened?

Id: [0x00245B38]
Just a small misunderstanding over a crate of weapons.

Id: [0x00245B3E]
Soldiers shouldn't concern themselves with something so petty.

Id: [0x00245B3F]
I just hope to see my brother again, <i>misthios.</i>

Id: [0x00245B41]
Sounds like he's a smuggler. I don't help lowlifes.

Id: [0x00245B42]
Ha! Lowlifes? You're no better than those soldiers.

Id: [0x00245B45]
We must all learn to fear and respect the gods. To do otherwise is to risk their wrath.

Id: [0x00245B46]
It could just be a prayer on behalf of the warrior.

Id: [0x00245B47]
That's what I thought, too. Until I read this part...

Id: [0x00245B48]
It mentions that the ritual will be activated.

Id: [0x00245B49]
What ritual?

Id: [0x00245B4A]
If you take no risks, you win no wars.

Id: [0x00245B4B]
Exactly! How is it a mercenary understands this when the "greatest" generals of Athens don't?

Id: [0x00245B4C]
I'm not sure whether I should feel flattered or insulted.

Id: [0x00245B4E]
Sounds like a fantasy to me. Did the Cult cook that story up, too?

Id: [0x00245B4F]
I'd watch your fucking mouth. Or I'll shut it for you.

Id: [0x00245B50]
You didn't when you had the chance before. And I bet you won't now. [beat]This is stupid. We need to find our <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x00245B54]
By Zeus, I can't believe I fell for that.

Id: [0x00245B60]
A man stalks me. I'm sure he means to do me harm.

Id: [0x00245B61]
Why would he want to hurt you?

Id: [0x00245B62]
I simply relieved him of some drachmae. He has far too much already, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00245B6C]
The leader of the nation has excessive wealth. He has three servants to follow him wherever he goes!

Id: [0x00245B6D]
So, he likes to show off.

Id: [0x00245B6E]
That's not all. Rumor has it he stores valuables in a cave not too far from the city. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to him... or his loot.

Id: [0x00245B78]
A man and his thugs are coming to kill me, <i>misthios</i>! I killed his brother, and he has sworn to kill me in return.

Id: [0x00245B79]
Why did you kill his brother?

Id: [0x00245B7A]
You should have seen his sword. Such beautiful craftsmanship! I had to have it for myself. He didn't even know how to use it.

Id: [0x00245B83]
An outlaw and his thugs are causing trouble for everyone near the city.

Id: [0x00245B84]
You don't seem so honorable either.

Id: [0x00245B85]
Is it really stealing if what I took never belonged to this bandit chief in the first place? Now his thugs won't leave me in peace.

Id: [0x00245B93]
A curse on this day, <i>misthios</i>! I have been given a hefty fine. How am I to pay?

Id: [0x00245B94]
Why were you fined?

Id: [0x00245B95]
The soldiers inspected the wheat I bought, and they say I bought more than the law allows.

Id: [0x00245B9B]
Seems odd the soldiers would try to cheat an honest merchant... Though not unheard of.

Id: [0x00245B9C]
Well, they are! Now I must raise the drachmae for this fine. Or face a worse fate from the soldiers.

Id: [0x00245B9E]
Just be glad they didn't sentence you to death for your petty smuggling.

Id: [0x00245B9F]
To death? Wretched <i>misthios</i>. I will bring you closer to death and pick the drachmae off your corpse!

Id: [0x00245BA4]
That's the idea.

Id: [0x00245BA5]
At least I have this discovery. But you, <i>misthios</i>, all you have is the armor.

Id: [0x00245BAF]
My magic plants ensure the birth of strong sons and daughters.

Id: [0x00245BB5]
Your plants must be very popular.

Id: [0x00245BB7]
Do these really work?

Id: [0x00245BB9]
Well... The soldiers have been harassing me. They want their drachmae back. But the village herbalist is waiting for a delivery from me!

Id: [0x00245BBB]
Eppie, you have the tomb. And there will be other discoveries.

Id: [0x00245BBC]
Enough. Just leave me. Can you please leave?

Id: [0x00245BD6]
If I'm reading the map right, it must be close.

Id: [0x00245BD8]
A foolish man gambled away drachmae that he owes me to a camp of soldiers. Now he's refusing to pay me.

Id: [0x00245BD9]
I'm not a debt collector.

Id: [0x00245BDA]
And I am not a petty man, <i>misthios</i>. He chose to do business with me, he knew what that meant. If I don't get my coin, I want payment in blood.

Id: [0x00245BE4]
You're more skilled than the average Spartan. In time, you might even manage Athenian citizenship.

Id: [0x00245BE5]
The true pinnacle of success.

Id: [0x00245BEE]
Either death or exile awaits me, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00245BEF]
What did you do?

Id: [0x00245BF0]
I fell in love. But... the woman is married. We'll both suffer for our adultery.

Id: [0x00245BF6]
You committed a crime. You must have expected a punishment.

Id: [0x00245BF7]
You really think I'm a criminal, misthios? I fell in love! Now the soldiers are coming for my head.

Id: [0x00245BF9]
Love should not be a crime.

Id: [0x00245BFA]
I agree. Still... the soldiers are coming for my head.

Id: [0x00245C00]
Very nice, but not what Xenia wants.

Id: [0x00245C07]
Not what Xenia wants. May as well keep it for myself.

Id: [0x00245C0C]
I guess I'll have to keep this for myself.

Id: [0x00245C16]
When you're ready, meet me at the Pnyx in Athens.

Id: [0x00245C21]
This isn't your fight, Kassandra!

Id: [0x00245C22]
Unfortunately for you, it is.

Id: [0x00245C27]
It's not too late, you know. You can still join us.

Id: [0x00245C28]
We're not in Athens. You can't talk your way out of this.

Id: [0x00245C2D]
Why won't you just leave me alone? This is all your fault.

Id: [0x00245C2E]
You did this, Kleon. You have only yourself to blame.

Id: [0x00245C30]
I'll leave the politics to you.

Id: [0x00245C31]
As it should be. And I have more work for you, assuming you're up for it.

Id: [0x00245C38]
You climb like a sure-footed goat! But, uh, I don't know if I can clamber up so quickly.

Id: [0x00245C3D]
Other generals giving you trouble?

Id: [0x00245C3E]
They refuse to acknowledge I know what I'm doing. But it doesn't matter. I'll get the job done, and eventually all of Athens will know it. Are you ready for more work?

Id: [0x00245C43]
How about an amulet to protect you on your travels, <i>misthios</i>? My amulets ward off all evil!

Id: [0x00245C44]
My sword is protection enough.

Id: [0x00245C45]
Then I'm glad you're here. An unhappy customer is looking for me.

Id: [0x00245C46]
Your amulets won't protect you?

Id: [0x00245C47]
Sometimes magic needs a helping hand.

Id: [0x00245C4B]
Can we please not talk about death?

Id: [0x00245C4C]
Alannah, promise me that if I die down here, you'll rename this place the "CAVES OF THE DEAD".

Id: [0x00245C4D]
I'm on it!

Id: [0x00245C4E]
People...

Id: [0x00245C50]
But Athens recognizes only <i>select</i> citizens. Spartans recognize merit. In Sparta, a slave can rise.

Id: [0x00245C51]
Spartan rule would mean the demise of democracy.

Id: [0x00245C5C]
Wow! It's more elaborate than I could have imagined.

Id: [0x00245C62]
If I see one more grain of salt, I'm going to kill someone!

Id: [0x00245C63]
Patience. We're going to raid that stinking village once and for all, find a ship, and finally get off this salty wasteland.

Id: [0x00245C64]
What about that old couple, the ones you stole the shield from? We should slit their throats and take whatever they have left.

Id: [0x00245C65]
That family is off limits to you <i>malákes</i>! If either of you touch a hair on their heads, I'm going to cut off your hands and make you do pushups in the salt.

Id: [0x00245C68]
A group of bandits stole a magnificent dagger from a blacksmith. I bet I could find a better price for it than those fools.

Id: [0x00245C6E]
How did they build all this? What I wouldn't pay for an Isu toolbox...

Id: [0x00245C74]
This is different from Egypt. Some aethestic elements in common but... Hmm.

Id: [0x00245C80]
Just when I think I've seen everything the Isu can do... Wow.

Id: [0x00245C86]
Doesn't look like it's aged a day. Well, except for the dust.

Id: [0x00245C8C]
I didn't expect the sounds... or smells.

Id: [0x00245C8D]
You learn to harden yourself during battle, so you can do what you have to. There's time enough for fear and worry afterwards.

Id: [0x00245C92]
Zeus save me!

Id: [0x00245C97]
Oh no, oh no, oh no...

Id: [0x00245C9C]
Kassandra, please, help!

Id: [0x00245C9F]
I've broken no trust. You know I'm a Spartan and I've cleared the commanders as you asked.

Id: [0x00245CA0]
What drives you then, I wonder? Let me use this moment to make one last plea, <i>misthios</i>. Imagine a world without war, where peace brings prosperity for us all.

Id: [0x00245CA1]
You sound like you've moved into politics.

Id: [0x00245CA2]
Not before I play the part of general one final time. Meet me on the battlefield. I hope you choose the right side.

Id: [0x00245CA5]
I have a crate of goods to move in secret, but there are pirate boats nearby. I might be attacked if I make the delivery by sea.

Id: [0x00245CA7]
This General Lysander, you know him?

Id: [0x00245CA8]
What Spartan doesn't?

Id: [0x00245CA9]
If he's as good as he seems, then I'm even more grateful for your help. I respect his reputation, if not the man.

Id: [0x00245CAA]
War changes the rules for us all.

Id: [0x00245CAB]
So it does. Thank you, Eagle Bearer. I'm sure we'll meet again.

Id: [0x00245CB2]
<i>Misthios</i>, my brother was captured... by pirates! They demand a hefty fee as ransom.

Id: [0x00245CB8]
If you have enough drachmae, they will return him.

Id: [0x00245CB9]
I fear I may be far too poor to ever see my brother again.

Id: [0x00245CBB]
Show me the ransom demand.

Id: [0x00245CBC]
Curse you, <i>misthios</i>! I'll have your coin!

Id: [0x00245CBE]
Are there any deer nearby?

Id: [0x00245CBF]
This is Phokis, there's deer all over the place.

Id: [0x00245CC0]
This elixir sounds odd. Where did you learn about it?

Id: [0x00245CC1]
Why, the Pythia told me about it. She's so wise, solving a problem I didn't even know I'd have.

Id: [0x00245CC3]
Where can I find a bear near here?

Id: [0x00245CC4]
I heard there's a cave near the sanctuary[2042590] that a large male bear has claimed.

Id: [0x00245CCE]
There's a merchant ship near the port with a crate of gold and silver ingots, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00245CCF]
You sound like you're plotting something.

Id: [0x00245CD0]
Someone got there before me. Cursed pirates tried to take the boat. The chest must be on the ocean floor by now. The pirates are still circling, looking for it.

Id: [0x00245CD9]
Earn it anyway. I need a final push against the Spartan command. Are you prepared to do it?

Id: [0x00245CDB]
I have an opportunity for you, <i>misthios</i>. A rich man has been giving lots of drachmae to the Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x00245CDC]
What makes this an opportunity?

Id: [0x00245CDD]
They have so much from him! They won't miss a little drachmae split between us.

Id: [0x00245CE5]
I haven't failed you yet, have I?

Id: [0x00245E3F]
A crate of wine fell from my boat... It's very expensive wine, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00245E40]
Why don't you go get it?

Id: [0x00245E41]
The soldiers are watching the port. If they see me retrieve it, they might think I'm smuggling.

Id: [0x00245E42]
<i>Are</i> you smuggling?

Id: [0x00245E43]
Not in so many words. The crate is mine, I swear. But those cursed soldiers watch my every move.

Id: [0x00245F63]
Have you come to help me?

Id: [0x00245F65]
Please, you must help me.

Id: [0x00245F67]
Have mercy, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00245F69]
I don't think they would have ever let me go. Now that I'm free, though, there's something else you can do for me.

Id: [0x00245F70]
Take pity on me.

Id: [0x00245F72]
I can't catch a break, it seems.

Id: [0x00245F74]
How could this have happened?

Id: [0x00245F76]
The gods have truly forsaken me.

Id: [0x00245F8B]
I will take your life, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x00245F90]
Just let me rest for a bit... I'll be ready in no time. Just [pant]wait.

Id: [0x00245F92]
I'll have your guts!

Id: [0x00245F9C]
I will hunt you<i> down</i>!

Id: [0x00245FA2]
The rock of Athens will crush you!

Id: [0x00245FA8]
You call yourself a Spartan?! Ha!

Id: [0x00245FB6]
They just keep coming!

Id: [0x00245FBC]
More for me!

Id: [0x00245FC4]
You might've been granted freedom, but you'll never be truly free, Agapios. You have duties and responsibilities, to the Magistrate, to Euboea, even to your brother. Some shadows cannot be outrun.

Id: [0x00245FC5]
Perhaps I'll never truly feel like a free man... but that doesn't mean I can't be a <i>good</i> man. I'll stay here. My brother deserves a proper goodbye, if nothing else.

Id: [0x00245FC8]
The <i>misthios</i>! Let's get them!

Id: [0x00245FCA]
What was that about?

Id: [0x00245FCB]
I'm sorry, misthios. They knew we talked - they threatened me. [beat, more upbeat]The Dagger REALLY don't like you.

Id: [0x00245FD1]
You told them what you had to in order to survive. There's no shame in that.

Id: [0x00245FD2]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00245FD4]
If you ever do that again, I will kill you myself.

Id: [0x00245FD5]
I understand.

Id: [0x00245FDD]
I'll stab you in the back!

Id: [0x00245FE4]
You'll make a satisfying meal!

Id: [0x00245FEB]
My beasts will feast on your carcass!

Id: [0x00245FF5]
I'm sorry <i>misthios</i>. I had no choice.

Id: [0x00245FFC]
You can't move a rock!

Id: [0x00246003]
<i>I</i> am the king of the arena!

Id: [0x0024600F]
Thanks for saving me. Stop by my farm anytime for some free olive oil.

Id: [0x002462E7]
I don't have to tell you anything. I don't know you.

Id: [0x002462E8]
Well, I know you. [beat]It doesn't matter. There's more important things to argue about.

Id: [0x00246340]
If they're after all of us, there's one less person to find. I killed Nikolaos.

Id: [0x00246341]
Yet here you are acting so righteous. When really, you're just like me.

Id: [0x00246342]
If it's true they're after us, tell them they'll never find Nikolaos. He's off the map. Trust me, I've searched myself.

Id: [0x00246343]
If I could find you, the other long lost child of Nikolaos, then I can find him. And when I do, he'll wish he was thrown off that mountain.

Id: [0x0024636D]
It's responsibility, not weakness. I won't abandon the whole family just for spite.

Id: [0x0024636E]
Responsibility? Get off your high horse. The Cult has a plan, and it won't be interrupted by the likes of you.

Id: [0x00246370]
Weak? I've had to kill for much longer than you've had to.

Id: [0x00246371]
Oh, I'm so scared.

Id: [0x002463B1]
We still found each other, brother.

Id: [0x002463B3]
I told you <i>not</i> to touch me.

Id: [0x002463B4]
[&scream]You're being an asshole.

Id: [0x002463B6]
You'll have to be stronger than that.

Id: [0x002463B7]
I'll take the challenge.

Id: [0x00246411]
The Port of Nisaia. If I'm going to find Athenian supplies this'll be the place.

Id: [0x00246413]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x00246419]
Fort Geraneia is formidable. This must be where the Athenians keep their war chest.

Id: [0x0024641C]
I don't trust that horse.

Id: [0x0024641E]
[beat]But if <i>you</i> don't know where she is, that means she abandoned you, too. How sad.

Id: [0x00246421]
I can't believe they fell for that.

Id: [0x00246424]
It's your plan. I'm the person doing the work, not making the decisions. Blame yourself if it isn't enough.

Id: [0x00246425]
Enough. I'm not paying you to mock me.

Id: [0x0024655D]
For Athens!

Id: [0x00246561]
West Wind, what do you bring me today?

Id: [0x00246562]
I found one of the treasures you sent me for.

Id: [0x00246563]
I'll take it off your hands... but you won't be rewarded until you've brought back both, of course.

Id: [0x00246564]
Of course.

Id: [0x00246591]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x002465D2]
I have an army behind me. One false move, and you're obliterated. That's the plan.

Id: [0x002465FA]
For [drunken burp]Sparta!

Id: [0x00246601]
Deimos!

Id: [0x00246602]
Deimos!

Id: [0x00246622]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x00246624]
How do I get inside?

Id: [0x00246634]
Very good.

Id: [0x00246635]
Demosthenes.

Id: [0x00246636]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x00246641]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x0024664B]
You know who was a true hero?

Id: [0x0024664E]
The Spartans are trying to find our supply lines. We've caught several spies already. We cannot afford such a loss.

Id: [0x0024664F]
Not if you want to keep your troops alive, no.

Id: [0x00246650]
I need you to kill more of their commanders. Leave their hoplites without leadership. They'll be scrambling.

Id: [0x00246651]
Are you sure? Spartans are fierce warriors.

Id: [0x00246652]
Warriors, yes. Thinkers, no. They react like wild animals. Put them in a situation that requires genuine thought, and they fall apart.

Id: [0x0024665C]
My career is none of your business. Know that I don't seek much. Only proper recognition of my strategic brilliance.

Id: [0x00246660]
Have you held this command for long?

Id: [0x00246663]
What do you think your future holds?

Id: [0x00246664]
Victory or death. You don't stay a general for long if you don't win battles.

Id: [0x00246665]
I suppose many generals die on the field.

Id: [0x00246666]
Not the majority. The Athenian people are the greatest threat to a general's life. If you displease them, they'll remove you from office. Ostracize you. Or even condemn you to death.

Id: [0x00246667]
And you want this job?

Id: [0x00246668]
There is no greater purpose than the glory of Athens. It's my duty and my honor.

Id: [0x0024666A]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x0024667A]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x00246682]
But you have plans for them later.

Id: [0x00246683]
Someday, I want my children to see them. Then they'll witness me donate them to a temple. That should inspire them to earn their own.

Id: [0x00246685]
They are already at a disadvantage. They made an enemy of me.

Id: [0x00246689]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x00246699]
I take it you sided with Kleon on its construction.

Id: [0x0024669A]
History will side with him, too.

Id: [0x0024669B]
Admire? It's Perikles's folly. How many thousands of drachmae were spent to glorify his vanity?

Id: [0x0024669C]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x002466A4]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x002466AC]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x002466B4]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x00246719]
It seems you've been serving my "friend" General Lysander. Tell me, does he truly think himself a god?

Id: [0x0024671C]
I said, pull yourself together.

Id: [0x00246721]
My dreams are forever haunted. <i>Mater</i> will bleed. <i>Pater</i> will scream.

Id: [0x00246747]
I can't wait to see the Pythia. I hope I get to see her soon.

Id: [0x0024674B]
My old bones can't take much more waiting.

Id: [0x0024674F]
At this rate, I'll be at Hades's gate before I see the Oracle.

Id: [0x00246754]
Hopefully, the Cult won't bother me now I'm out of Athens.

Id: [0x00246758]
These young people should let us see the Pythia first.

Id: [0x0024675C]
Gods grant me strength to endure this wait.

Id: [0x00246760]
When I was a girl, the line to see the Oracle was much shorter.

Id: [0x00246764]
I'm sick of sleeping on the streets. I just want to see the Pythia.

Id: [0x00246768]
Everyone's so impatient these days. I'm just happy I'll get to see the Oracle at all.

Id: [0x0024676C]
Another sunrise, another day of waiting to see the Oracle.

Id: [0x00246770]
I can barely move, I've been sitting here so long.

Id: [0x00246774]
The last time I saw the Pythia, she told me I'd die in war. I guess she's wrong sometimes.

Id: [0x00246779]
Only the Pythia knows what my fate is.

Id: [0x0024677D]
I hope the Oracle will guide me to my future wife.

Id: [0x00246781]
The wait to see the Oracle is killing me.

Id: [0x00246785]
I shouldn't be here. I should be back on the farm.

Id: [0x00246789]
I'm seeing her soon. I saw it in a dream.

Id: [0x0024678D]
Only one more day and I can see the oracle.

Id: [0x00246791]
Any day now. Any day now.

Id: [0x00246795]
I feel like I've been here since the war started.

Id: [0x00246799]
I'd give anything to see the Oracle today.

Id: [0x0024679D]
My friend said I was crazy to come here, but she will show me the way.

Id: [0x002467AA]
I hope to be as wise as the Oracle someday.

Id: [0x002467AE]
This wait is unbearable.

Id: [0x002467B2]
I must see the Pythia soon. It's urgent.

Id: [0x002467B6]
This city is miserable. I just want to see the Pythia and leave.

Id: [0x002467B8]
A band of thieves is plaguing this area. Nothing is safe.

Id: [0x002467BC]
The Oracle is here. I'm so excited!

Id: [0x002467C0]
Maybe I'll get to see the Oracle tomorrow.

Id: [0x002467C7]
My husband would be mad if he knew I was here.

Id: [0x002467CB]
Are all of these people really here to see the Oracle?

Id: [0x002467CF]
Phokis! I can't believe I'm actually here.

Id: [0x002467E6]
A band of thieves is plaguing this area. Nothing is safe.

Id: [0x002467EE]

Id: [0x0024682D]
I hope we meet again, Skoura.

Id: [0x0024682F]
I thought so, too.

Id: [0x00246830]
What about Anaia, your daughter?

Id: [0x00246836]
Let's go.

Id: [0x00246837]
You go. I think I'll stay here awhile.

Id: [0x00246838]
You're a fool.

Id: [0x0024683A]
A united Greek world. Seems like fantasy now.

Id: [0x0024683B]
Agreed. But coming back from the war was harder than the war itself. Maion and I found daily life afterward to be... difficult. We had been men filled with life-and-death purpose. We found that again in the arena.

Id: [0x00246846]
And now he's very sick.

Id: [0x00246A54]
"The Robin and the Kingfisher." [sigh]When you can't trust your own family, who can you trust?

Id: [0x00246A5A]
Most of my life, I begged for the gods to bring my brother back. Instead, they gave me a man who took my brother's name. As for the boy, he can never return.

Id: [0x00246A5D]
The crew fought off what they could, but we were too late.

Id: [0x00246A5E]
We have to move, Neleus may be in danger. I'll ready the ship.

Id: [0x00246A60]
You should go. There's nothing left you can do here.

Id: [0x00246A64]
The Dagger is gone, but so is Agapios. History will remember this day as a great victory. [beat]I'll remember it as something else.

Id: [0x00246A68]
I can't thank you enough for saving Euboea and Agapios.

Id: [0x00246A70]
Nevermind, I've lost interest.

Id: [0x00246A71]
What? No, no, no! You don't know what you'll be missing out on.

Id: [0x00246A72]
Maybe later, Mikkos.

Id: [0x00246A74]
We're here!

Id: [0x00246A75]
Here, take this.

Id: [0x00246A77]
Drink that. It will help you get better.

Id: [0x00246A7A]
Drink that. It should help you get better.

Id: [0x00246A98]
Want to fight?

Id: [0x00246A9A]
I'm leaving.

Id: [0x00246A9C]
I miss Skoura...

Id: [0x00246AA2]
Things are different now with a new hero of the arena. Not bad. Just different.

Id: [0x00246AA8]
So you're the new hero they keep going on about? You didn't have to do what you did...

Id: [0x00246AAE]
Hero of the arena? Never thought I'd see the day. You deserve it.

Id: [0x00246AB4]
Wow. The new hero of the arena...

Id: [0x00246ABC]
I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x00246ACC]
I should check his pockets.

Id: [0x00246BC1]
There seems little doubt that Rhexenor is aligned with the Cult of Kosmos.

Id: [0x00246BC4]
We're not all so bad.

Id: [0x00246BC5]
Prove yourself by escorting me to my brother, Davos. My drachmae's yours if you do it.

Id: [0x00246BC9]
Barely a day in Kephallonia, and this is my welcome. Horrible people.

Id: [0x00246BE0]
Anything for a little brother.

Id: [0x00246BE2]
I told you we're not all bad.

Id: [0x00246BE4]
This misthios was one good egg in a basket of duds. Pay her for me, will you, Davos?

I told the story of Perseus to my tutor, and he said it was the best rendition he'd ever heard. My mother is so happy with us!

Id: [0x00246CCF]
<i>Chaire</i>.

Id: [0x00246CD0]
The other generals disagree, but I refuse to let them destroy our chances.

Id: [0x00246CD1]
We're not going to win a contest of strength against those brutes. We need to outthink them. So, will you kill the commanders?

Id: [0x00246CDD]
Do you have some more stories for us, Eagle Bearer? Maybe about a chariot team called the Champion Ducks? Or a giant wooden rabbit used to sack Troy? I don't believe any of your tales!

Id: [0x00246CE3]
Kill the commanders and bring me their seals. We'll see how the other generals react to <i>that</i>.

Id: [0x00246CE5]
Training is hard, but I live for it. One day Theoros and I will be renowned for our iron and skill. Our legends will grow as great as Kastor and Polydeukes!

Id: [0x00246CE8]
It is up to me now to carry the honor of my family. No matter what Trainer Iatrokles throws at me, I will not fall.

Lots of contracts about this Con of Kos. Must be a bonehead.

Markos. Another vineyard?

An example must be made of the cowards deserting our armies.

Id: [0x00246DFB]
You have shown Theoros what it means to be a true warrior of Sparta. He has found an inner fire he did not have before. He will be a good influence on his brother now.

Id: [0x00246DFD]
OK, let me rephrase. Where was the crew meant to be?

Id: [0x00246E00]
I regret I did not see Theoros's weakness sooner. I could have harderened him so he would not bring shame to his family... Or at least ensured he had an honorable death.

First, I have some questions.

Id: [0x00246FD4]
As long as they are threatened, the battle must be fought.

Id: [0x00246FD8]
Ugh, that smell is going to linger on me. At least the river runs clear now.

Id: [0x00246FF6]
Hmm. These don't look like the knife wounds of a man.

Id: [0x0024700F]
Mauled to death? May your journey across the Styx be a more peaceful end than this.

Id: [0x00247013]
I can't believe I have to tidy everything up around here. Now I'm beginning to understand Teuta's anger.

Id: [0x00247017]
It's a wonder anything grows in this field with all this mess crushing the plants.

Id: [0x0024701B]
The tanners in Kephallonia use something that smells awful to make leather. It can't be good for the soil.

Id: [0x0024705B]
One should be at the animal pens to the west, one is building a house in the northeastern corner, and one works in the fields to the south. Come back here when you're done.

Id: [0x0024705C]
We're loading olive oil shipments... Thing is, the farmer with the olive trees could be getting a much better price.

Id: [0x00247062]
If the farmer deserves a better price than he's getting, he should know.

Id: [0x00247064]
A better deal is always good. Especially when I'm part of the arrangement.

Id: [0x00247066]
We could all benefit from the farmer reading this letter from my merchant friend. Well, except the current trader... He might make problems for us.

Id: [0x00247076]
But for now, will you go to the farm to stop those bandits? I don't think I can take them all on myself.

Id: [0x00247078]
I overheard some pirates at the docks planning a raid on an artist in the city... Kill her and steal her vases, they said. Valuable, they said.

Id: [0x00247079]
Do you know the artist they're planning to attack?

Id: [0x0024707A]
Just where she lives. But even a stranger shouldn't get killed like that. I'd deliver a warning or help her if could, but if I don't load cargo, I don't eat.

Id: [0x0024708E]
My brother used to work these docks with me. A Spartan killed him for his cloak when they took the port.

Id: [0x0024708F]
For a cloak?

Id: [0x00247090]
Just a simple thing our <i>mater</i> made. But a commander liked it, and my brother said no. You don't say no to a Spartan here.

Id: [0x002470A1]
A Spartan commander's sword is well guarded in a military camp... But if it were to become more accessible, I could get a good price for it... discretely.

Id: [0x002470AA]
Athenian guards have been cracking down on pirates and inspecting cargo for smuggling... Or so they say.

Id: [0x002470AB]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x002470AC]
Really what they're doing is beating dockhands bloody and taking our cargo. I can't afford to replace the crate of olive oil they "confiscated."

Id: [0x002470B6]
These wines I'm loading are rare vintages. There's a politician in the city said to be willing to pay handsomely for a cask.

Id: [0x002470B7]
If any of the wine goes to the politician, won't the traders notice?

Id: [0x002470B8]
The thing about supplies here is sometimes there are accidents. If some supplies get destroyed, who's going to know where a cask went?

Id: [0x002470C6]
I've got a tiny bit of land outside the city. My wife farms it, and I send her money. When I make enough I'll go there, too. After the war.

Id: [0x002470CC]
It's... nice that you have a plan in these times.

Id: [0x002470CE]
I have my own plans to attend to. So if you've got something to say, say it.

Id: [0x002470D0]
Her last letter said that wolves were prowling the farm. I want to send her help and send her money, but I can't go. And I certainly can't fight wolves.

Id: [0x002470DC]
The shield is long destroyed, but Zeus's feather remains.

Id: [0x002470DD]
I said I was sorry!

Id: [0x002470E4]
Last week? This shit happens <i>every</i> week.

Id: [0x002470E6]
[sighs]I can't keep doing this.

Id: [0x002470E8]
Thanks for the warning.

Id: [0x002470EF]
What happened to <i>you</i>?

Id: [0x002470F0]
It's nothing, Phoibe. All taken care of now.

Id: [0x002470F1]
The Cyclops again, huh? Hasn't he learned his lesson yet?

Id: [0x002470F2]
Apparently not.

Id: [0x002470F4]
Of course. Help yourself.

Id: [0x002470F6]
You hungry too, Ikaros?

Id: [0x002470FA]
Do you think Zeus would bless <i>me</i> with an eagle? Like he blessed you, Kassandra? ...Maybe you could ask him for me!

Id: [0x00247101]
Phoibe...

Id: [0x00247102]
[grunt]We've been over this.

Id: [0x00247105]
I know, I know. He's just an eagle.

Id: [0x00247108]
I'll try to put in a good word for you.

Id: [0x0024710B]
Finally!

Id: [0x0024710D]
So. What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0024710F]
Oh! I almost forgot! Markos is looking for you.

Id: [0x00247110]
What does that weasel want now?

Id: [0x00247111]
Don't know. He wants you to meet him at his new house. On his vineyard.

Id: [0x00247112]
What? A vineyard?<i> Maláka</i>!

Id: [0x00247113]
It's on the road to Sami. He says wine will make him rich.

Id: [0x00247119]
Since when has he had a vineyard?

Id: [0x0024711A]
Yesterday I think?

Id: [0x0024711B]
So Markos - who owes<i> me </i>drachmae - is buying vineyards? With what money?

Id: [0x0024711D]
I dunno.

Id: [0x0024711E]
Where can I find Markos's new, beautiful estate?

Id: [0x0024711F]
You know the statue of Zeus on Mount Ainos? It's south of that!

Id: [0x00247120]
Well, I guess I owe Markos a little visit. Thank you, Phoibe.

Id: [0x00247124]
I'll go tell Markos you're coming!

Id: [0x0024712A]
[groan]My head...

Id: [0x00247132]
Fun's over. Tell that one-eyed freak if he ever sends you here again, I'm gonna cut out his other eye and feed it to my bird.

Id: [0x00247137]
You made a mistake coming here.

Id: [0x00247139]
I'll see Markos as soon as I'm dressed.

Id: [0x0024714A]
Hey, shit-face! Get down here!

Id: [0x0024714C]
Cyclops's got a message for you!

Id: [0x0024714F]
Tell your boss he can stick it - [up a goat's ass.]

Id: [0x00247153]
That's for last week!

Id: [0x00247155]
<i>Maláka!</i>

Id: [0x00247201]
Oh beautiful misthios. If only I had more Aphrodite flowers.

Id: [0x0024720C]
It's best you left us alone. My son is very fragile.

Id: [0x0024720D]
I should have never let my son go to Delphi.

Id: [0x00247212]
This one looks promising...

Id: [0x00247217]
He'll make a worthy addition to the crew.

Id: [0x0024721E]
I should see who else is around, I still need more crew.

Id: [0x00247220]
She cared for us after my wretch of a father got himself lost or dead.

Id: [0x00247224]
Just another drink... For fortification, improves the stamina.

Id: [0x00247225]
[rawwwr]Testikles!

Id: [0x00247229]
Another sip, then training. Good for the constitution.

Id: [0x0024722A]
Yeah, Testikles the champion!

Id: [0x0024722E]
Maybe the punch was a bit hasty, but I couldn't wait forever. Neither could Hippokrates.

Id: [0x00247265]
Before you go, I heard something from Aspasia... about Kephallonia.

Id: [0x00247266]
What is it?

Id: [0x00247267]
She said there was some sort of plague. You don't think... My friend... The blood fever...

Id: [0x00247268]
Don't think like that. Whatever happened on Kephallonia isn't our fault. I'll go myself and find out if this plague even happened, OK?

Id: [0x00247269]
OK... thanks.

Id: [0x0024726A]
I knew I could count on you!

Id: [0x0024726F]
So if Kallias provided the poison, he's likely to have the antidote.

Id: [0x002472CB]
The soldiers said they will kill me if I don't pay them when they come back!

Id: [0x002472CC]
Slow down. What are you talking about?

Id: [0x002472CD]
Soldiers are extorting dockhands for a cut of the cargo, but I can't pay. If the sailors think I'm stealing, they'll kill me!

Id: [0x002472CF]
Retrieve your shield from where you left it and return to the <i>agoge.</i> Soon you'll embrace your brother again.

Id: [0x00247313]
Lost to the mountains, or taken by wolves.

Id: [0x00247314]
Since the Spartans seized the port, they've made life terrible for the dock workers. Take our cargo, beat us... Dogs.

Id: [0x00247315]
They're attacking workers?

Id: [0x00247316]
Anyone who isn't Spartan is a target. The captain in the port is the worst. Thinks everyone and everything belongs to him.

Id: [0x00247340]
Where's your tough talk gone now?

Id: [0x0024736E]
You're a messenger of Zeus, you show them the light.

Id: [0x0024736F]
Maron claims the animals have been poisoned, but I have no enemies to speak of.

Id: [0x00247478]
There was a ship went down recently. It had casks of wine on it. <i>Expensive</i> wine, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00247479]
Could the casks have survived the wreck?

Id: [0x0024747A]
If there are gods, at least one must have. I can fence it... I just can't get near it for all the sharks.

Id: [0x00247482]
These fancy captains and officers talk too much... Think dockhands don't have ears?

Id: [0x00247488]
You learn things when people think no one is listening. What have you learned, friend?

Id: [0x0024748A]
I'm not interested in your wounded pride, just the information. What did you overhear?

Id: [0x0024748C]
There's a captain in the port that shouldn't be. Smuggler and a thief. I sketched down where. There's an Athenian commander who'd pay to see that... or see him dead.

Id: [0x0024748E]
Magistrate Xanthe said you would examine my fields and see why the gods have cursed me so.

Id: [0x002474BB]
There's a dirty thief that helps himself to cargo the moment my back is turned.

Id: [0x002474BC]
Don't turn your back, then.

Id: [0x002474BD]
Easier said than done. There's a lot to load. But I saw him last time. Saw which boat he's using to ferry stolen cargo, too.

Id: [0x002474C3]
Stand still and let me hit you!

Id: [0x00247513]
Come on, that's the spirit!

Id: [0x00247596]
You'll have to try harder if you want to live![short laugh]

Id: [0x0024759E]
Friend of mine down on the docks got killed by some bandits for the cargo he was loading.

Id: [0x0024759F]
That's terrible. What was the cargo?

Id: [0x002475A0]
Painted vases secured in a chest. Valuable, but a stupid thing to get killed for. I want vengeance for his family. The price on those vases would help them, too.

Id: [0x002475A6]
The stele piece looks like it can be placed...

Id: [0x0024760F]
Diktys couldn't stop his brother, so it was up to Perseus to interfere and be annoying.

Id: [0x00247610]
"Prove yourself a warrior and fetch me a worthy wedding gift," the king said, "by killing a great monster!"

Id: [0x00247611]
However, Andromeda's mother boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than the goddess Thetis, offending her!

Id: [0x00247627]
There's another merchant who's begun sailing to many of the same towns I do, undercutting me with inferior product. His wines are like oil. His olive oil is like <i>tar</i>.

Id: [0x0024762D]
If your wares are better, you shouldn't worry about competition.

Id: [0x0024762F]
If it was your route first, then that's the same as stealing from you.

Id: [0x00247631]
He needs a message delivered to him. Him and his pitiful wares. Delivered by one like <i>you</i>... Maybe he'll back off before I have to take more drastic measures.

Id: [0x002476B5]
Opportunistic bastard of a bandit chief and his thugs have taken over this area without a strong leader to stop him. I'll have nothing left to sell if the farmers keep losing their crops to him.

Id: [0x002476B6]
Isn't this a matter for the soldiers?

Id: [0x002476B7]
This bandit scum will have taxed me into poverty and claimed all the goods in the region by the time the soldiers organize. He's already taken all my drachmae.

Id: [0x002476FB]
There's another merchant. He's accusing me of stealing his sales! I heard he's paying a mercenary to have me killed! Who would do such a thing?

Id: [0x00247702]
You'd be surprised what money can make a person do.

Id: [0x00247704]
I take contracts like that all the time. You should take this seriously.

Id: [0x00247706]
Gods protect me. I can't believe he would have me killed. Oh, there must be something you can do.

Id: [0x0024774A]
I've been doing a good business selling milk to the doctor and his patients in the village. Good for all kinds of ailments.

Id: [0x0024774B]
Then why are you upset?

Id: [0x0024774C]
Because the doctor is trying to cut me out. Got his own little herd of goats. Thinks he's a farmer, and a salesman, AND a doctor. He needs... Not a threat, exactly. But a message delivered.

Id: [0x002479E1]
That talisman you've got, there's a priestess I know who uses that kind of charm in her rituals. I could arrange a sale of that for you.

Id: [0x002479E2]
Profit from random junk I find suits me.

Id: [0x002479E3]
One small problem. Followers of Ares also use those talismans, so they occasionally try to murder the priestess for them. Hopefully she's alive when you bring it to her to sell...

Id: [0x002479E6]
No one knows the terrain like a merchant forced to lug his wares back and forth over it year after year, <i>misthios</i>. [beat]Or knows where to find abandoned valuables in hidden crevices.

Id: [0x002479E7]
Good for you.

Id: [0x002479E8]
And for you, perhaps. The map I could draw you would be useful with so many soldiers now moving through the area... Or to a scavenger willing to pay its fair price.

Id: [0x002479ED]
A trail... someone ran towards the mountain heights. Could be Theoros.

Id: [0x002479F0]
Here's a joke for you, <i>misthios</i>: What did the Spartan say to the merchant who overcharged him?

Id: [0x002479F1]
Nothing. You don't talk to corpses.

Id: [0x002479F2]
Ha! You know that one already. Well then, you understand my problem. There's a commander who is accusing me of price gouging new recruits. Not true, of course.

Id: [0x002479F3]
Of course.

Id: [0x002479F4]
He told me to clear out, or he'd gouge me. My eyes, I think he said. But, business has been so good other than the death threats... I can't leave! Now I'm in trouble if he comes back.

Id: [0x002479F6]
A pirate steals from a poor merchant? The merchant loses his goods. The pirate steals from a merchant who can afford revenge? The pirate loses his ship... or his head.

Id: [0x002479F7]
Having trouble with pirates?

Id: [0x002479F8]
One particular idiot whose ship has been docking here and who has a taste for the wines I sell, yes. But he's about to have much more trouble with me. And perhaps with you?

Id: [0x00247A27]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>. That big <i>petasos</i> you have looks just like the hat my assistant, Petron, wears when he runs deliveries. How strange to see a mercenary with one.

Id: [0x00247A28]
Actually, I found it on a body.

Id: [0x00247A29]
Oh, poor Petron. I knew there were brigands on his route, but... I just thought he was off seeing his lover again. Perhaps he should have the <i>petasos</i>. Curse these bandit-infested wilds!

Id: [0x00247A31]
With the magistrate and his overseers in turmoil over the leader's death, the new foreman of this quarry is throwing away months of planning in order to turn a quick personal profit.

Id: [0x00247A5F]
What do you mean? What plans is he throwing away?

Id: [0x00247A61]
If there's money to be made, someone is going to make it.

Id: [0x00247A64]
He's going to send the next shipment with another merchant's boat. What will my buyers do? They've already waited for the materials to finish construction. This will cripple them. And me.

Id: [0x00247A66]
Gods save me! The wolves nearly had me that time. Crows take them, I'll never make it to the city at this rate.

Id: [0x00247A67]
Why are you heading to the city?

Id: [0x00247A68]
I have herbs from the countryside to sell to a doctor there. It's all arranged. It would be a simple delivery if I wasn't being savaged at every step!

Id: [0x00247A6A]
I paid a commander to sneak some of my goods to buyers in the city without paying the Agoranomoi and their tariffs. Now that business is good, he's asking for a bigger cut.

Id: [0x00247A6B]
I specialize in a different type of cut.

Id: [0x00247A6C]
No, that is the kind I have in mind. He extorted the wrong merchant, friend. I will have what I've earned.

Id: [0x00247A6F]
Things have gone badly here since someone stole our nation's most valued resources, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00247A75]
Oh? My sympathies, it's a difficult time for all.

Id: [0x00247A77]
Strange, I feel like my fortunes have increased lately. Must be lucky.

Id: [0x00247A79]
The people suffer. No one can afford to buy from me, and so I suffer too. What little drachmae I had left was stolen by bandits. Even they suffer, I know. But I will not starve to let them eat.

Id: [0x00247A7D]
The hardest part of being a traveling merchant is all the travel. Er... I mean, you have to find a place to sleep. I came across a bandit camp and they let me stay there. Even shared their wine with me.

Id: [0x00247A7E]
But then they robbed you. Because they are bandits.

Id: [0x00247A7F]
I figured if I was giving them drachmae to stay in the camp, they wouldn't take my drachmae. It made sense at the time. I think. No more drinking wine at bandit camps.

Id: [0x00247A81]
With the soldiers controlling the harbor, shipping schedules have become muddled. A ship is arriving today to deliver a cargo of figs and grapes, I am told.

Id: [0x00247A82]
That's nice?

Id: [0x00247A83]
It's not so nice for me. My own shipment of fruits arrives tomorrow, and the market will already be flooded by then... Unless something can be done about today's arrival.

Id: [0x00247A9D]
There was a time when I would worry about wolves tearing my throat out when I was traveling to sell my wares.

Id: [0x00247A9E]
You don't worry about that now?

Id: [0x00247A9F]
Now I worry the bandits will tear it out before the wolves can. The countryside isn't safe, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00247ADD]
I've got excess mandrake among my wares, and there's a witch nearby willing to pay a good price for it.

Id: [0x00247ADE]
Sounds like a good match.

Id: [0x00247ADF]
It is, but I've got a healthy fear of the wolves that prowl near her home. And a healthy fear of witches, come to think of it.

Id: [0x00247AEF]
I can't believe you won!

Id: [0x00247AF0]
You're amazing!

Id: [0x00247AF1]
You really showed them!

Id: [0x00247AF2]
I want to be just like you when I'm older.

Id: [0x00247AF4]
You're so strong!

Id: [0x00247AF5]
I'm going to remember that forever!

Id: [0x00247AF6]
You did it!

Id: [0x00247AF7]
They didn't stand a chance!

Id: [0x00247AF9]
Don't go!

Id: [0x00247AFA]
Teach me how to be like you!

Id: [0x00247AFB]
You're the strongest person I've ever seen!

Id: [0x00247AFC]
Come back next time and win again!

Id: [0x00247B85]
Sparta wages an immoral war against dear Athens! Those brutes defy our intellect. They care only for the strength of the body, not the strength of the mind.

Id: [0x00247B86]
A change in power is never easy.

Id: [0x00247B87]
Not easy? The Spartan commander and his men pollute our virtuous city with their filth! What will be left of the thinkers, the scholars?

Id: [0x00247C0C]
They're... They're all dead.

Id: [0x00247C14]
Apollo himself should smite your precious Hippokrates!

Id: [0x00247C15]
Of course not, but...

Id: [0x00247C17]
But priestess, Hippokrates does respect Apollo.

Id: [0x00247C18]
What an outrageous claim! Your words are daggers thrust into the heart of our faith. Do you want to bring ruin to all of Argolis?

Id: [0x00247C1A]
Then tell me where to find Hippokrates!

Id: [0x00247C1B]
Forgive me, but I really can't help you.

Id: [0x00247C42]
Debris might be getting stuck in this net. Maybe the dead man was a fisherman.

Id: [0x00247C46]
The earth is stained here, that can't be good for the soil.

Id: [0x00247D69]
No... no. That ring belonged to my son. His enemies found him after all.

Id: [0x00247D6A]
He had enemies?

Id: [0x00247D6B]
My son was a great thinker, like me. But not everyone liked his ideas. A commander and his soldiers often quarreled with him, causing him to flee the city. [beat]He didn't go far enough, it seems.

Id: [0x00247D6D]
Tell me, do you live a clean, vegetarian life? Or do you stain your soul by eating meat?

Id: [0x00247D73]
Meat is necessary for strength.

Id: [0x00247D74]
You fool! For what is strength? There is nothing greater than the strength of the soul, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00247D76]
I stick to vegetables when I can.

Id: [0x00247D77]
Ah, you are wise! A pure body is the first step to a pure soul. If only there were more like you.

Id: [0x00247D79]
You expect everyone to be a vegetarian?

Id: [0x00247D7A]
Eating meat breeds violence. A herd of goats will be butchered at the shrine before the public feast. It disgusts me.

Id: [0x00247D7D]
A woman in the city has been sheltering a deserter. What would you do with such traitors and cowards?

Id: [0x00247D83]
To fear the war is to be human. Let them have some peace.

Id: [0x00247D85]
I'd have both their heads. They don't deserve to live.

Id: [0x00247D87]
The deserter must die. Of that, I am certain. But the woman... Her fate is not for me to decide. A message must be sent to the Athenian commander so he learns of her treachery.

Id: [0x00247D89]
Cursed pirates! Tell me, <i>misthios</i>, what is the life of a pirate worth, when their crimes bring ruin to others? Don't they deserve the wrath of the gods? What would you do?

Id: [0x00247D8F]
No need to bother with the divine when my blade cuts deeper than a god's wrath.

Id: [0x00247D91]
Maybe I can help. Hades has welcomed all who have crossed me.

Id: [0x00247D93]
Good! Their leader is a common drunk. He sails them to port, killing, thieving, and drinking in a local tavern before sailing away again.

Id: [0x00247D97]
I am to be tried, <i>misthios</i>... charged with impiety. They say my teachings deny the will of the gods.

Id: [0x00247D98]
If true, that is a serious offense.

Id: [0x00247D99]
Our lives are guided by the irrational and the unknown, not the divine! My writings explain this wisdom. I fear with my impending trial that my work may not reach the person meant to transcribe it.

Id: [0x00247D9E]
That's everything Perikles wanted. Time to return to him and find out what these Athenians know about my mother.

Id: [0x00247DA0]
Defilers of nature! Disgusting... despicable! This is against nature, <i>misthios</i>, against all natural order! We are all animals - we are all one. Animal flesh, human flesh - we are the same!

Id: [0x00247DA1]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x00247DA2]
Bandits! The war has driven them to desperation. They've captured a wild bear to eat! This is wrong, <i>misthios.</i> So very wrong!

Id: [0x00247DA4]
In these times of privation, only the mind is truly rich. My students and I are wealthy in thought.

Id: [0x00247DA5]
And do your students understand how wealthy you've made them?

Id: [0x00247DA6]
There... is the physical aspect to consider. My students and I have been forced to wander searching for sympathetic learners. It has made us vulnerable to attacks from bandits and animals.

Id: [0x00247DEA]
There are people who argue against the teaching of philosophy. Argue most violently.

Id: [0x00247DEB]
Have you been attacked?

Id: [0x00247DEC]
Oh, the occasional maltreatment is a part of being a philosopher. But these Followers of Ares... The questions I ask fly in the face of their twisted devotion. I fear they will kill me.

Id: [0x00247DF5]
Above and below, <i>misthios</i>, the thoughts and the feelings. The intellect and the passions. Which rules you?

Id: [0x00247DFD]
I take action... Once I know the situation and how to master it. I'll say intellect.

Id: [0x00247DFF]
Passion. I live as I feel. And I get things done while others are still thinking about what to do.

Id: [0x00247E02]
You've just won me a bet on the true souls of mercenaries. Speaking of which... I've had some troubles lately with a less enlightened <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00247E03]
What kind of troubles?

Id: [0x00247E04]
He disapproves of my teachings. Or perhaps that thing with his wife? The difference is academic. He means to kill me, in any case.

Id: [0x00247E06]
There was a woman, an admirer of my speeches. She told me that every time I spoke, she felt as if she were dying.

Id: [0x00247E0C]
Your words obviously meant a great deal to her.

Id: [0x00247E0E]
Better to die and be done with hearing the speeches, then.

Id: [0x00247E10]
Yes, well. One with the true ability to kill with a word took her from me. A commander sent soldiers to tax the weaver who employed her. He couldn't pay. A fight broke out...

Id: [0x00247E11]
And she was caught in the middle?

Id: [0x00247E12]
Indeed. And now my words ring hollow in my own ears. But perhaps they can still bring death.

Id: [0x00247E14]
My students and I have been debating intrinsic purpose, <i>misthios</i>. The reasons the gods... or nature have shaped the world.

Id: [0x00247E15]
My purpose is solving problems. Usually with a blade.

Id: [0x00247E16]
As the lion solves the problem of too many antelope. This is only natural. Which... all this talk of nature and not necessarily of gods has put me at odds with the Followers of Ares. I have been threatened.

Id: [0x00247E18]
There is a place I go to open my mind to nature. It was there that nature made clear to me that I must become a philosopher.

Id: [0x00247E19]
Too bad nature didn't tell you to become a wealthy statesman.

Id: [0x00247E1A]
Nature does nothing in vain, they say. You must see this place, <i>misthios</i>. Open your mind to the workings of the world and consider your purpose.

Id: [0x00247E1C]
A leader dies. Was he a great man? Will he be reborn as a greater man? A lesser one?

Id: [0x00247E1D]
He's dead. What do you care?

Id: [0x00247E1E]
I am... not entirely welcome at the temple because of my questioning. I'd send an offering to the priestess if someone would go on my behalf.

Id: [0x00247E20]
I will never see my son playing knucklebones again. Never hear his laugh. I knew I had fathered a mortal, but... to lose him like that. To beasts of teeth and fin.

Id: [0x00247E21]
The sharks?

Id: [0x00247E22]
Vengeance against brutes without reason is irrational for a thinker, but I would do anything to kill them. Or to know if his bag of knucklebones are with the bones in their bellies.

Id: [0x00247E2A]
My family has wealth. Prestige. I have been a soldier. I have known glory and victory. None of it fulfilled me. Now I will leave and search as a philosopher.

Id: [0x00247E30]
It takes time to find your place in the world. Do what you must.

Id: [0x00247E32]
You're luckier than most, sophist. You've just decided not to be satisfied.

Id: [0x00247E34]
Perhaps <i>you</i> are the philosopher, <i>misthios</i>. I will leave the city and wander. I must send a message, tell someone I am leaving. But to who? To my old commander or my truest friend, a merchant?

Id: [0x00247E36]
Is violence the natural state of humanity? Is there such a thing as peace, or are there simply moments between attacks?

Id: [0x00247E37]
I prefer fighting to thinking about fighting. Get to the point.

Id: [0x00247E38]
Oh, of course. A strong leader dies, and weaker, meaner leaders rise up. The commander of the nearby camp has become violent and tyrannical. He and his soldiers should learn a truth or two.

Id: [0x00247FF7]
King Pausanias is part of the Cult of Kosmos. I'll have to kill him myself.

Id: [0x00247FFA]
You return on the wind. Do you have Ajax's golden feather for me?

Id: [0x00247FFF]
Someone will hear you.

Id: [0x00248000]
I hope they do! In fact, they'd likely believe Kleon was in this very room!

Id: [0x00248001]
I don't know...

Id: [0x00248002]
A pomegranate, how delicious! Ah, yes I know of every crop in all of Attika and whose it is, for I know all! I am no different than all of you. No, don't give it any thought! I want to rule Athens. Doesn't that sound good? Of course it does! You do love Athens, don't you? I do, too! Let's love Athens together under my rule!

Id: [0x00248009]
I'll make sure every single one of these Cultists dies by my hands.

Id: [0x0024800E]
Alkibiades said the hetaerae here could help me find my mother.

Id: [0x00248018]
Thank you, my child! We must get away from here.

Id: [0x0024801B]
Could more bandits be coming? Please, let's get out of here.

Id: [0x0024801D]
[&phew]The richest person in any land is the one who wants for the least. And I want for nothing at all.

Id: [0x00248024]
The capital, Megara... If the leader's anywhere, he'll be here.

Id: [0x00248065]
My younger brother is a corrupt and lazy commander. It shames my family to have our shield on his shoulder. But I have retired to politics... What can I do?

Id: [0x00248067]
In the city, I am a leader, a council member, and a citizen. No one would dare attack me. On my diplomatic visit here, I have been at the mercy of beasts and bandits.

Id: [0x00248068]
Welcome to the countryside.

Id: [0x00248069]
Perhaps I have no real power, but I can still enforce order. Wolves and wolf-like men should fear Spartans.

Id: [0x00248070]
You there. You have a kind soul. [beat]Help an old man buy his next meal?

Id: [0x0024807A]
Ah, I could hear your footsteps. Welcome back.

Id: [0x0024807D]
If I could see these great lands, I would, but... you could be my eyes.

Id: [0x0024809B]
If you knew the things I've done, you wouldn't be so quick to call me kind.

Id: [0x0024809C]
Nonsense. Your soul is greater than the sum of your actions, stranger... Tell me, what do they call you?

Id: [0x002480A1]
Your... <i>soul</i> also seems kind.

Id: [0x002480A2]
I am grateful and humbled, stranger. Tell me, what do they call you?

Id: [0x002480A5]
Depends on who's asking... But my name is Kassandra. And you are?

Id: [0x002480A6]
Just a simple beggar. I sailed from Persia to see the beauty of the Greek world.

Id: [0x002480A9]
I'm not much of a storyteller, but I will be your eyes.

Id: [0x002480AA]
I knew I sensed kindness in you. You've made this old Persian happy again.

Id: [0x002480AB]
Don't thank me yet. What places do you wish you could have seen?

Id: [0x002480AC]
Ah, my favorite tales were always of the Akrokorinth[2406380], the statues of Zeus[2406432] and Athena[2384638], the perch of the armored bird in Arkadia[2407653], and of course, the mysterious Mount Taygetos.

Id: [0x002480B0]
I'm sorry, Persian, but I'm no storyteller. Find someone else.

Id: [0x002480B2]
So, tell me what you know about the the Statue of Zeus[2406432].

Id: [0x002480B3]
"Its great bolt stood ready to punish the Kephallonians below," or so I was told.

Id: [0x002480B4]
There are many statues to Athena. Which one do you mean?

Id: [0x002480B5]
In my mind, there is only one. Her story always began, "As we rounded the hilltops, we could see Athens bustling below us, and Athena above, matching our gaze."

Id: [0x002480B6]
The Akrokorinth[2406380]... Don't tell me, it's in Korinthia.

Id: [0x002480B7]
Smart guess. It is the most renowned temple to Aphrodite, your goddess of all life's most pleasurable trivialities.

Id: [0x002480B8]
I'll be back with stories to tell.

Id: [0x002480BA]
I've seen Kephallonia from the Statue of Zeus[2406432].

Id: [0x002480BB]
Tell me, is it still a place of great beauty?

Id: [0x002480BE]
You'll be glad to know I've been to the Statue of Athena[2384638] at the Akropolis[2041036<CR>].

Id: [0x002480BF]
Ah, if only I could have been there to feel her presence. Would you... describe her to me?

Id: [0x002480C2]
I traveled to the Akrokorinth[2406380]. From there I could see all of Korinthia.

Id: [0x002480C3]
Ah! I can only wonder at what the worshippers of Aphrodite do to pay her tribute.

Id: [0x002480EF]
You need it more than me. Here, take it.

Id: [0x002480F0]
A generous gift. Thank you. What do they call you, stranger?

Id: [0x002480F2]
When the city was besieged, I fled with my family. I do not fear death but... I won't see my wife enslaved.

Id: [0x002480FB]
I need to find the artifact that fits here.

Id: [0x002480FD]
You cannot rely on the enemy to be merciful. You were wise to escape when you had the chance.

Id: [0x002480FF]
You're a politician. A leader. You betrayed your people to save your own skin.

Id: [0x00248101]
I am ashamed to run, but my wife is my everything. We were separated in the flight, and soldiers chased after her.

Id: [0x00248102]
And you hid here while they chased her?

Id: [0x00248103]
What's done is done. But she can still be saved.

Id: [0x00248107]
Those were Followers of Ares! I can scarcely believe they are attacking people openly like this.

Id: [0x00248108]
Whether you believe it or not, they will kill you. Be more careful, friend.

Id: [0x00248109]
You're right. This is serious. I... We must strike against them. And send a warning to the priestess at the temple.

Id: [0x0024810B]
The city is suffering. The people threaten revolt. Only the gods can help us at a time like this.

Id: [0x00248111]
You're a leader. Take responsibility and do something yourself.

Id: [0x00248113]
The gods must be very angry for it to be this bad. What can we do to appease them?

Id: [0x00248115]
I must send an offering to the temple. The blasphemous Followers of Ares will try to interfere with a true offering, though.

Id: [0x00248117]
When Athens gains new territory, it opens up opportunities. For the people, for the merchants who feed them, and for the councils that control them.

Id: [0x0024811D]
Glad to hear the people are thought of. What opportunities has the conquest created?

Id: [0x0024811F]
And what about opportunities for the mercenaries who do the dirty work?

Id: [0x00248121]
If merchant ships and supplies there were to meet with an accident, they would need goods shipped from merchants here. [beat]Merchants I have arrangements with.

Id: [0x00248123]
That papyrus you found is a coded message. I think we have a spy at the council.

Id: [0x00248124]
It's a war. There are eyes watching everywhere.

Id: [0x00248125]
We should get that code in front of our own eyes. [beat]And blind our enemy.

Id: [0x00248127]
In the city we debate the war and its course, but it's only now, after visiting the villages, that I see its impact. I had no idea.

Id: [0x00248128]
You're protected in the city.

Id: [0x00248129]
I've written a message to another councillor, but words alone won't make this right. We must stop the soldiers responsible.

Id: [0x0024812E]
That's the pipe. Opening it should flood the bath and get rid of the snakes.

Id: [0x00248133]
If it's worth money, I'll find it. They said the ship was on its way to Thera...

Id: [0x00248135]
Every mongrel in Athens barks his opinion. In Sparta, the powerful speak, and the weak must listen.

Id: [0x0024813B]
Power often falls in the hands of the wise. The weak should listen.

Id: [0x0024813D]
The Athenian system seems like chaos, but it's a chaos that reflects the will of the people.

Id: [0x0024813F]
The people don't know what they want. They think they need lower grain prices, and so my rival and his pet merchant campaign against me. But those tariffs pay for soldiers, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x00248141]
That papyrus you have there, misthios... It looks like a roster for a meeting of councillors, but I'm not on it.

Id: [0x00248147]
If these names are your peers, and you're not among them, there's a reason for it.

Id: [0x00248149]
Don't jump to conclusions. It could be a list for anything.

Id: [0x0024814B]
My greatest ally, Koinos, is also not on the list. He must be alerted. This is that cursed leader Daphnis's doing! He's always plotting against us.

Id: [0x0024814D]
I have been injudicious. I overindulged at the revels, and there is a letter I wrote to a woman that I'd prefer not be made public.

Id: [0x0024814E]
Who is the woman?

Id: [0x0024814F]
Let's just say she isn't someone I should have been writing letters to. My political rivals could use her to make things difficult for me and my wife.

Id: [0x00248155]
Ah, I was hoping you'd be back.

Id: [0x00248158]
Lend an old fool your company a while.

Id: [0x00248167]
If you'd like to hear about the bird, I could describe it to you.

Id: [0x00248168]
Nothing would make me happier.

Id: [0x0024816B]
What do you remember about this armored bird in Arkadia?

Id: [0x0024816C]
There's a beast made of armor jutting out from the mountainside, overlooking Lake Stymphalos and the undulating fields stretching like waves on a golden sea all across Arkadia.

Id: [0x0024816D]
I returned to Mount Taygetos.

Id: [0x0024816E]
Returned? Tell me, did you meet the mountain god who devours Spartan children?

Id: [0x00248171]
You did say Mount Taygetos, didn't you?

Id: [0x00248172]
You sound like you know that place... I have heard tales of its appetites. They say the mountain feeds on the suffering of Spartans, so the people there offer their own children to the mountain god for sacrifice.

Id: [0x00248173]
It's awkward hiring a mercenary when it's a freelancer I'm already having problems with.

Id: [0x00248179]
Tell me about this other mercenary. I can help.

Id: [0x0024817B]
You get what you pay for. If you'd hired me first, your troubles would be over.

Id: [0x0024817D]
Maybe... I hired a mercenary to kill a rival of mine, but instead I hear he's headed for a ship. He could expose me to my rival if he gets away.

Id: [0x0024817F]
There's a slave to be branded for running away, but he's actually a spy gathering information for me.

Id: [0x00248180]
To be branded in your service... I hope you're paying him well.

Id: [0x00248181]
I cannot pardon him openly, but I've written a letter to the magistrate. Only... I fear punishment may be faster than truth.

Id: [0x00248183]
With the death in leadership, a rival of mine in the gerousia is maneuvering for power through his brother, a commander known for his brutality.

Id: [0x00248184]
You're making enemies of the soldiers and the politicians?

Id: [0x00248185]
Yes, but I am making friends with mercenaries.

Id: [0x00248187]
The Athenians are behind the theft of our nation's most precious resources, I know it. Cowards know they can't defeat us in a fair battle, and so they scheme and steal.

Id: [0x00248188]
Seems effective.

Id: [0x00248189]
Well, Sparta can play a subtle game, too. If they refuse to meet our soldiers in the field, then we will send freelancers against their supplies and boats.

Id: [0x0024818B]
My friend, a commander... They say he went mad at the festival and attacked another officer.

Id: [0x00248191]
The sting of mania... He did something to displease the gods.

Id: [0x00248193]
Sounds like your friend can't hold his wine.

Id: [0x00248195]
He saved my life. He must be freed. I'll bribe the other officer. [beat]Or kill him. I won't see one moment of madness ruin a good man.

Id: [0x00248197]
With the city under their control, the Spartans are slaughtering anyone they see as a leader or a threat.

Id: [0x00248198]
Calm down, you're safe now.

Id: [0x00248199]
But my wife! If they sent soldiers after me, there must be some who went looking for me with her. They'll kill her when they don't find me!

Id: [0x002481C1]
Bandits! What a surprise...

Id: [0x0024821E]
It seems like fire is the only way to be sure of ending the blight.

Id: [0x0024827D]
I'll bet it's the metal from the armor giving the water a bad taste.

Id: [0x00248298]
The soldiers have captured a lion. Those <i>malákes</i> tease and taunt it for sport, poking it with sticks! Such a great beast is deserving of respect, not this vile degradation.

Id: [0x0024829A]
I doubt a simple <i>misthios</i> could do much, but... a wounded lion prowls nearby. I've seen its tracks and blood trail, but I can't find its hiding place.

Id: [0x0024829B]
If the tracks are fresh, it should be easy to find.

Id: [0x0024829C]
I'm afraid the tracks are the problem. The scent of its blood is causing other beasts to follow it and cover up its trail. [beat]I fear carnage when they catch up to it.

Id: [0x0024829E]
I shouldn't be sharing this with an outsider, but... my sisters seek to help a young woman in the village. Her father, a cruel brute of a commander, has always tried to control her.

Id: [0x0024829F]
How do the Daughters of Artemis plan to help her?

Id: [0x002482A0]
We had a plan to take her in once she escaped him, but... he must have gotten wind of it. He's locked her away in a military camp to keep her from us.

Id: [0x002482A2]
Keep away from here. Don’t go any further! I've had enough of people like you setting traps in this area, wounding the animals in their home.

Id: [0x002482A3]
People like me?

Id: [0x002482A4]
Bandits. They are luring our animals with the scent of fresh meat.

Id: [0x002482AA]
You've made a mistake. I'm not a bandit.

Id: [0x002482AB]
Prove it, then. Bandits... mercenaries... you're all the same to me. Taking for yourselves. Do something for someone else, for once.

Id: [0x002482AD]
If you know what's good for you, you'll step aside, huntress. I'm getting past you.

Id: [0x002482AE]
You were warned to stay back, outsider. I won't warn you again!

Id: [0x002482B6]
I wonder, was that mere luck? Could you manage such a feat a second time?

Id: [0x002482B7]
Is that gratitude?

Id: [0x002482B8]
I just never expected help from a <i>misthios</i> like you.

Id: [0x002482B9]
A misthios like me can do many things... if you ask nicely.

Id: [0x002482BA]
Well. [beat]My sister was also captured by those filthy bandits. They took her to another camp.

Id: [0x002482BD]
A beautiful beast has been captured by soldiers. Your kind has no respect for animals!

Id: [0x002482BE]
My kind?

Id: [0x002482BF]
You city people are all the same - selfish. [beat]I bet it would kill you to do something for another creature.

Id: [0x002482C1]
Thieves everywhere! Right now one of those <i>malákes</i> is cutting down our forest, loading up his boat with wood to sell at the port.

Id: [0x002482C2]
A thief, you say? Or a merchant?

Id: [0x002482C3]
A merchant is a thief if he takes what is not his, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x002482C5]
Wretched bandits set the forest alight! Many creatures have lost their homes... They should not have to live this way. Death is less cruel than leaving them with nothing.

Id: [0x002482C7]
These soldiers encroach further and further! Their commander orders them to build their camps near our grounds, disrupting all the wildlife.

Id: [0x002482C9]
I wouldn't normally go to an outsider with this, but I'm afraid to go to my sisters.

Id: [0x002482CA]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x002482CB]
A great wolf stalks me... only me, night and day. I tried to save its cub and failed. Its pack has been haunting me ever since.

Id: [0x002482CD]
A shrine near here attracts more pilgrims every day.

Id: [0x002482CE]
What's wrong with pilgrims?

Id: [0x002482CF]
They trample rare plants and scare away animals. So careless.

Id: [0x002482D0]
What do you think should be done?

Id: [0x002482D1]
I have a politician friend who might have the shrine moved in exchange for a generous gift. Or maybe the shrine could just... disappear?

Id: [0x002482D3]
So many people want my antlers. It's wonderful and terrible at the same time.

Id: [0x002482D4]
I didn't think the Daughters of Artemis would hunt for profit.

Id: [0x002482D5]
I don't hunt for antlers, I gather ones that have fallen.

Id: [0x002482D6]
What use are antlers?

Id: [0x002482D7]
Well, herbalists and doctors use crushed antlers to make medicine. I just don't have time to deliver them all.

Id: [0x002482D9]
Athenian soldiers are pigs. No, pigs can be caring and kind. They're failed pigs.

Id: [0x002482DA]
What have they done?

Id: [0x002482DB]
They're holding a feast celebrating the death of a Spartan leader.

Id: [0x002482DC]
Soldiers will feast at the death of any enemy, worthy or not.

Id: [0x002482DD]
I don't care what the Athenians celebrate. But their commander is sending those gluttons to butcher dozens of goats. They must be stopped.

Id: [0x002482DF]
A forest nearby is befouled by deserters. They slaughter animals carelessly, wasting blood and flesh. One deserter even dared kill the head of the wolf pack.

Id: [0x002482E1]
Do you enjoy eating octopus, <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x002482E7]
Fresh octopus with lemon... the perfect snack.

Id: [0x002482E9]
No thanks, I hate those creepy tentacles.

Id: [0x002482EB]
How can you say that? The octopus is a beautiful and intelligent creature.

Id: [0x002482EC]
I never thought of it that way.

Id: [0x002482ED]
Merchants near here are buying up all the octopus they can and hanging it to dry. Soon there won't be any left off these shores.

Id: [0x002482EF]
A group of bandits took my sister prisoner! We were just trying to stop them from hunting. I barely escaped with my life!

Id: [0x002482F1]
Be careful, the Spartan army is bloodthirsty today.

Id: [0x002482F2]
When aren't they?

Id: [0x002482F3]
Ever since their leader was killed, rivals have been springing up to take his place. Soldiers have been slaughtering wolves just to adorn their armor with the pelts.

Id: [0x00248318]
I can do many things, Persian, but I can't restore sight.

Id: [0x0024831B]
Nor would I want you to. My blindness is a burden that the gods have given me to carry, and I will.

Id: [0x00248325]
You and I have something in common. Neither of us has any drachmae.

Id: [0x00248327]
Your company is gift enough, but... I don't know your name. What do they call you, stranger?

Id: [0x0024832C]
Then what?

Id: [0x0024832D]
Be my eyes. When I was a boy, an Athenian told me the most beautiful tales of your lands. I would love to hear them again. Would you go see the places I never was able to, and return to tell me the tale of your adventures?

Id: [0x00248331]
If you need anything else or forget where to find the Dagger man, speak to us again.

Id: [0x00248339]
Looking good as usual, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024833E]
I'm feeling a bit better.

Id: [0x00248C09]
Kassandra! Get over here, you spineless jellyfish, you!

Id: [0x00248C0E]
Who's this?

Id: [0x00248C0F]
Maybe this one has the jewels!

Id: [0x00248DCC]
Thanks for coming with me. Would you say you've killed many people?

Id: [0x00248DCD]
Why do you ask me that?

Id: [0x00248DCE]
If someone is impious to the point of doing grave injustice to people as well as the gods, do they not deserve punishment?

Id: [0x00248DCF]
What did Praxithea do?

Id: [0x00248DD0]
She spoke false prophecies for years. Those who came to her for advice received only lies.

Id: [0x00248DD1]
Your grandmother... was an oracle?

Id: [0x00248DD2]
Yes, up on the hill in Delphi! She confessed to me recently that she never heard the gods, and only repeated the words she was told.

Id: [0x00248DD3]
Told by vile people with evil intentions.

Id: [0x00248DD4]
Exactly. Wars have been fought over those words. She can't be left unpunished. I...

Id: [0x00248DD5]
My family was torn apart by a false prophecy. If it was one of hers, I may take matters into my own hands.

Id: [0x00248DDB]
Taking a life, people do that every day. Am I a coward?

Id: [0x00248DE0]
I'm surprised Apollo himself didn't strike her down long ago.

Id: [0x00248DE5]
What did you expect me to do? All that talk about killing... A solution showed up, so I took it.

Id: [0x00248DE6]
That wasn't the way it was supposed to happen. She's my responsibility, not yours.

Id: [0x00248E9E]
Gods be good, please untie me!

Id: [0x00248EA0]
Have mercy! Cut me free!

Id: [0x00248EA2]
Help me, before these murderers butcher me!

Id: [0x00249046]
This is a great day for democracy. Our civilization will shape the world for the next thousand years.

Id: [0x00249049]
The light of Athenian civilization is snuffed out by Spartan brutality. But mark my words, we will rekindle it.

Id: [0x0024904C]
There is much to be done. Leave me.

Id: [0x00249061]
Thank you, my child! We must get away from here.

Id: [0x00249065]
Could more bandits be coming? Please, let's get out of here.

Id: [0x00249088]
Eppie will want to see all of this.

Id: [0x0024908E]
Wow! What a battle! You fought like Atalanta!

Id: [0x0024908F]
Huh, you do fight with the strength of the gods.

Id: [0x00249092]
This old goat is not as easy as he looks, eh? Still, you fought well.

Id: [0x00249093]
That wasn't much of a contest at all. Theoros would have won!

Id: [0x002491B9]
Someone's beaten me to it. I'll have to take a closer look.

Id: [0x002491BE]
A battered scarf. I'm looking for someone with torn clothes...

Id: [0x002491C3]
These pots were broken <i>before</i> the fire.

Id: [0x002491C8]
The pottery matches the ones at the temple.

Id: [0x002491CD]
Hmm, his clothes are torn... and they match the color.

Id: [0x0024929F]
Is nothing sacred? Ancient and valuable relics were housed in this temple. Now the scum has taken it all and burned it down.

Id: [0x002492A0]
They've burned it to cover their tracks.

Id: [0x002492A1]
The scum ran off towards town with an armload of our most sacred items. Likely in the beggars' quarter, from the look of him.

Id: [0x002492A6]
So many are unworthy. That beggars' quarter in town is a disgrace. Full of thieves and miscreants.

Id: [0x002492B5]
Thieves will not be tolerated in the house of the gods.

Id: [0x002492B8]
I have you to thank for raising my status even higher.

Id: [0x002493A0]
Ugh, I hate the water. I've given up fishing. I serve the gods now.

Id: [0x002493A1]
Fishing's a worthy occupation. What caused such a change?

Id: [0x002493A2]
A sudden storm, as if the gods themselves stepped on earth. The ship keeled over and sank. Right out there! The gods saved me.

Id: [0x002493A3]
Did this happen after you picked up a stone relic?

Id: [0x002493A4]
Well, I might have used some temple rock as a boat anchor. Nothing of value.

Id: [0x002493A5]
It's good that the gods delivered you to safety.

Id: [0x002493A9]
Imagine the gods taking interest in a weary old soul such as myself.

Id: [0x002493BE]
I'll never forget how the skies opened and swallowed my boat.

Id: [0x002493C1]
The wind carries word from the gods.

Id: [0x002493F3]
There is a woman I love, and I think she loves me, but her father wants to match her with someone who's guaranteed access to food. A soldier... a commander!

Id: [0x0024940B]
A commander is not an easy rival to compete with.

Id: [0x0024940D]
Follow your heart. There must be a way to win her father's approval.

Id: [0x0024940F]
If the goats and supplies the soldiers rely on were removed, he wouldn't look so good. His unit might even leave the area.

Id: [0x0024946B]
I should have known better than to gamble with a bandit chief. He cheated me!

Id: [0x0024946C]
You... were expecting an honest bandit?

Id: [0x0024946D]
Laugh all you want, but I know I had that cheat beat. If it takes my last drachma, I'll get him for this.

Id: [0x00249536]
I heard rare herbs grow in these caves and came looking for something I could sell. But bears chased me down, and I think I heard wolves. Gods help me, I'm scared.

Id: [0x0024954A]
I'm no fighter, but I was supposed to be employed as a rower on a trireme. Not noble work, perhaps, but honest, and I would finally be of use to Athens.

Id: [0x0024954B]
"Supposed to be"?

Id: [0x0024954C]
The sea here has become a battleground. Until there are fewer pirates and enemy ships in the area, the Athenians won't hire rowers, they'll just use infantry.

Id: [0x0024954E]
The gods are angry with us for allowing these Followers to have their foul shrine near our city. They've killed our leader as punishment. We must atone!

Id: [0x002495AA]
So the leader is dead. Doesn't usually matter much to the poor folk like me.

Id: [0x002495AB]
Then what do you want with me?

Id: [0x002495AC]
The ones it does matter to, like the soldiers, they fight and they rob until a new leader makes them stop. They've got blood on their swords and drachmae in their pockets that came from poor people like me.

Id: [0x002495AE]
My friend and I, every so often we go out to the farms in the country and see if they have any work. I was sick and didn't go with him last week, and now he's gone.

Id: [0x002495AF]
You think something happened to him?

Id: [0x002495B0]
I don't know. There are all kinds of things out in the country - beasts, bandits, Followers. I want to look for my friend, but I'm afraid I'll go missing, too.

Id: [0x002495B2]
The war, the theft, the rich keeping me down... There isn't much left for me above the waves.

Id: [0x002495B8]
Do not throw yourself to the waves, friend.

Id: [0x002495BA]
It's a tough world for everyone. You can't drown yourself. You must continue.

Id: [0x002495BF]
What? Gods, no! I want to sell any weapons the soldiers left behind in the shipwreck out there, but I'm afraid of the sharks. Trust me, I don't want to die!

Id: [0x002495C1]
The priests of the temple have called for a hecatomb for the festival - a sacrifice of 100 goats.

Id: [0x002495C2]
That's a lot of dead goats.

Id: [0x002495C3]
Ha, yes. But it's never actually that many. We sacrifice a small group and call it a hecatomb.

Id: [0x002495C4]
That's good. I can't take up full-time goat killing.

Id: [0x002495C5]
I wish the bandits felt the same way. We've got precious few goats for ourselves and for sacrifice without them picking off strays.

Id: [0x002495C7]
A merchant in the town, he loaned me money, but now he's charging me interest I can't pay. It's a ridiculous amount, but he says I signed a "debt certificate."

Id: [0x002495C8]
Did you?

Id: [0x002495C9]
I don't know! I can't read. I scratched a little mark onto a papyrus because he said if I did, he'd give me money. He's taking advantage of me.

Id: [0x002495CB]
The pirates raid the port, and beat us, and rob us. Then soldiers attack them, and we are beaten and robbed in the fight. Then the soldiers get bored, drink, and beat and rob us.

Id: [0x002495CD]
After the leader was killed, the soldiers pulled back to defensive positions - defensive for the richer citizens - but we're left open to attack.

Id: [0x002495CE]
Who is attacking you?

Id: [0x002495CF]
Who isn't?! In addition to attacks from the enemy, there are bandits and huntresses raiding us. Even the wolves have grown bold without soldiers to chase them away!

Id: [0x002495D1]
My family... We are poor but we have always been free. Now Spartans have attacked my brother's village, and I am worried for him. I can't stand the thought of him taken as a slave.

Id: [0x002495D6]
Based on the map, it must be nearby.

Id: [0x002495DB]
I should be close, if I'm reading the map right.

Id: [0x002495DD]
I was not born a citizen, and I was not born strong. Yet in my dreams at night, I am a great hero. I lay a great Athenian low with my blade... I cut down their soldiers like grass.

Id: [0x002495E9]
Yes, and then you wake up. The world is what we make it, not what we dream.

Id: [0x002495EB]
Dreams help us imagine the world as we would like it to be. A better place.

Id: [0x002495ED]
But last night I dreamed about a great hero for hire. And I realized I can make a difference. Through your power, I can strike at the enemies of Sparta. The leaders, soldiers, and sailors of Athens.

Id: [0x002495F2]
Hmm. The entrance must be underwater.

Id: [0x002495F5]
I found this tablet. I don't read, but even I know these are strange symbols. I think it is a code... I think the man who employs me is using our shop to spy on the soldiers nearby.

Id: [0x002495F6]
It does look like a coded message. Strange thing for a shop owner to write.

Id: [0x002495F7]
I was the only other one at the shop today. He'll know I took it! He'll be coming to kill me. I have to get this tablet to a commander.

Id: [0x002495F9]
I've been beaten and cursed my whole life by Spartans. I'm not a citizen. They don't even think I'm a person.

Id: [0x002495FF]
It's Sparta. Keeping everyone who isn't a Spartan down is what they do. Get used to it.

Id: [0x00249601]
Sparta is harsh. It can't have been easy for you here.

Id: [0x00249603]
I've been told I don't matter my whole life. Well, with a mercenary's help, there's something I can do that matters - I can hurt Spartans. Their soldiers... and their leaders.

Id: [0x0024960B]
The village is passing into control of the Athenians - I'm worried, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024960C]
But the worst of the fighting is over here.

Id: [0x0024960D]
Yes, that's why I'm worried. Now that the soldiers are gone, the Athenians might decide the rest of us need to go, too. Kill the men and enslave the women and children.

Id: [0x0024960E]
You could fight.

Id: [0x0024960F]
We're farmers and craftsmen, not soldiers. But if they suddenly needed food and supplies, and we could supply them... they'd see a need for keeping us.

Id: [0x0024969B]
These Followers of Ares have cursed the lands. I can feel it. Even the animals seem different. They have strange powers.

Id: [0x0024969C]
They are scum, but they are scum that dies like anyone else.

Id: [0x0024969D]
Maybe. But I'll feel better - and hunt better - when they and their foul shrine are gone.

Id: [0x0024969F]
It is time to honor Dionysos! Time to drink wine, <i>misthios</i>! But there is much to prepare, and the ghosts will soon rise from the earth.

Id: [0x002496A0]
Sure they will.

Id: [0x002496A1]
I have to bring pitch to the farmer to paint his door with... it keeps the ghosts out. But game must be hunted, and goats must be slaughtered, as well.

Id: [0x002496A3]
I've made sacrifices to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, but ever since the leader died, the whole area seems cursed. I need to purify it.

Id: [0x002496A4]
How are you planning to do it?

Id: [0x002496A5]
Artemis loves the hunt like I do - there are many goats and predators in this area. I think blood from the hunted will please her.

Id: [0x002496A7]
The soldiers that have invaded... they aren't good hunters. They chase the game away, but they don't catch any.

Id: [0x002496A8]
How are they surviving if they can't hunt?

Id: [0x002496A9]
They're relying on the dry good supplies they brought with them. But I don't have any supplies like that, and they've chased away my prey.

Id: [0x002496AB]
I've hunted most things that can hurt you, but the wolves and bears in this area are the fiercest I've ever seen. They have no fear.

Id: [0x002496AC]
Neither do I.

Id: [0x002496AD]
Ha, good. I know my limits, though. I'm no hunter of predators. I need these beasts thinned out so I can hunt the deer, hare, and boar that feed my village.

Id: [0x002496B1]
The soldiers in a nearby camp have captured a lion. The bastards mock it and throw their garbage into its cage. I can't stand seeing such a noble creature treated like this.

Id: [0x002496B5]
The people are desperate since the theft of the nation's chest. My traps have been stolen, my kills taken while I sleep. I can't afford to lose any more snares to these bandits.

Id: [0x002496D6]
My brother was a hunter, like me, and a good one. But he was no fighter. He told Sikinnios he wouldn't hunt for him, and Sikinnios killed him.

Id: [0x002496D7]
Who is Sikinnios?

Id: [0x002496D8]
An outlaw who wanted my brother to hunt for his band. And he's keeping my brother's bow unless I hunt for his men. I have a daughter, or I'd put an arrow in his throat myself.

Id: [0x002496F9]
Spies from the city have been creeping through the fields and delivering supplies. I think they're planning where to set up camp.

Id: [0x002496FA]
The war's not to your liking?

Id: [0x002496FB]
When is there not war? In the city they care for war. I just want to eat. There's plenty of places they can fight without trampling my hunting grounds. I need to see to these supply-running spies.

Id: [0x002496FD]
I've hunted in this forest for years, I will not abandon it. I will be here as it heals.

Id: [0x002496FE]
Is there enough game left for you to hunt?

Id: [0x002496FF]
Game remains and more will return. But I must protect myself. Carcasses are drawing out wolves in droves. Not to mention the bandits who comb the woods looking for easy victims.

Id: [0x00249701]
The new leader of the village has banned me from hunting lions. Says hunting lions is a trait of nobility. Ha. I've been hunting them my whole life. Do I look noble to you?

Id: [0x00249707]
There's a quiet nobility in living by your skills and your blades.

Id: [0x00249709]
You look like what you are. A poor hunter.

Id: [0x0024970B]
Ha. True. But now this soft, Athenian-born nobleman tells me the lions here are for him? He won't see any lions if I have my way.

Id: [0x0024970D]
The bears here have always been vicious, but generally they attack the game I'm hunting, not me.

Id: [0x0024970E]
Do you know why they've become so aggressive?

Id: [0x0024970F]
Something about a cave not too far from here seems to be drawing them near. Maybe they aren't all able to find enough foo- Wait. Did you hear that? I think another one is nearby.

Id: [0x00249715]
My husband and I tracked a bear to this cave, but it ambushed us once we went in. I ran out, but my husband's still inside. I think it's got him cornered. Curse my weakness, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x00249717]
Since taking control of the area, the soldiers have been forcing us to give up our crops and game. I'm only supposed to hunt to fill their bellies.

Id: [0x00249718]
How are you surviving?

Id: [0x00249719]
The soldiers and their commander watch me, so I cannot hunt. But perhaps a different kind of hunt will solve things...

Id: [0x0024971B]
The battle decimated my hunting grounds. The game chased off, the ground trampled. My family starves while the wolves eat the fallen.

Id: [0x0024971C]
You'll need to find new hunting grounds.

Id: [0x0024971D]
No, I know these fields. When the bandits and wolves are gone, when these robbers and eaters of corpses have been dealt with, the game will return.

Id: [0x0024971F]
Ah, my poor brother. He wanted to hunt wolves, but he should have stuck to hunting goats. Poor Nausikaa, his widow... She and the babies will be needing supplies now.

Id: [0x00249720]
What will they need?

Id: [0x00249721]
I have meat from my own hunt they can have. Someone will have to actually kill all these wolves, though. Ah brother. You were not ready, you fool.

Id: [0x00249723]
I have had a great hunt. I took two wild boars that fought like titans. But I left a blood trail, and wolves are tracking me. I hear them. I smell them. They're almost here...

Id: [0x00249764]
Enough! Stop! The maps are in my residence!

Id: [0x00249765]
Where?

Id: [0x00249766]
It lies next to the Nauplia Shipshed, not far from here.

Id: [0x00249767]
The maps better be there, or I'll come back for you.

Id: [0x0024976A]
May the gods curse you and your pirate mistress!

Id: [0x00249770]
Remind me where you hid Xenia's maps.

Id: [0x00249771]
I told you! They are in my residence! Don't break anything else.

Id: [0x00249776]
Hmm. This looks like the map. I think.

Id: [0x0024977B]
This better be the place.

Id: [0x00249782]
I think this is the place on this map...

Id: [0x00249786]
Must be near here...

Id: [0x0024978A]
Xenia's map-maker better be right...

Id: [0x0024978F]
Perfect breeding ground for bandits.

Id: [0x00249794]
According to the map, the location should be right around here.

Id: [0x00249799]
Now to find Xenia's other treasure.

Id: [0x0024979F]
Our precious cargo, Xenia's coffer, will be held in their treasury. Can you recover it?

Id: [0x002497A0]
I will.

Id: [0x002497A5]
Trainer, from what I could tell, your two charges spotted bandits sneaking across the mountains in the night.

Id: [0x002497A6]
Akamas fell, but I found Theoros, and helped him find his way back.

Id: [0x002497A7]
I'm sorry to hear of the fall of Akamas. But I suspect you've inspired Theoros to new heights. He will be a model for the younger ones to follow.

Id: [0x002497AA]
And? What happened then?

Id: [0x002497AC]
May Zeus guide them.

Id: [0x002497AD]
I have bad tidings for you, Trainer.

Id: [0x002497AE]
Let's have it. Better to take a hardship face-on than drag it out.

Id: [0x002497AF]
Bandits were in the mountains. Akamas died trying to fight them. Theoros survived, but his spirit is broken. He has no will to fight.

Id: [0x002497B0]
As you say.

Id: [0x002497B2]
Akamas fell, and Theoros abandoned his duty? These are bitter fruits you bring me, misthios. It will be up to Makarios to one day restore his family's honor for his brother's cowardice.

Id: [0x002497B4]
Look at the campsite where Theoros and Akamas were stationed, and determine what happened to them.

Id: [0x00249865]
Night and day we slave for Sparta. They take everything from us.

Id: [0x00249918]
I pay taxes, I pray and sacrifice, I try to be a good wife and mother. Why do the gods test me?

Id: [0x00249919]
Are you a philosopher or a farmer?

Id: [0x0024991A]
I'm neither right now. I can't plow my fields because wolves prowl. I can't tend my beehives because the bears have discovered them. At least I don't need to worry about my goats... Lions ate them.

Id: [0x0024991C]
Cursed fucking wolves won't get off my back.

Id: [0x0024991D]
Few people appreciate a wolf attack.

Id: [0x0024991E]
What I'd appreciate is being able to till my field without having to use my <i>ard</i> as a weapon. This area is crawling with beasts. [beat]Shit, I think I hear some now.

Id: [0x00249920]
Out here on the outskirts, we're always at risk from brigands. But they're people, too. I give them food sometimes, and they generally leave us in peace.

Id: [0x00249921]
That's... forgiving of you. But probably practical.

Id: [0x00249922]
I thought so, and it worked until recently. There's a new bandit chief in the area who isn't as neighborly as the last one, though. Where once we tolerated one another, now they're raiding us regularly.

Id: [0x00249924]
With my husband and sons gone to war, a greedy commander has been offering to "handle" selling crops at market for us. Really he wants the profits from my work.

Id: [0x00249925]
Can't you refuse him?

Id: [0x00249926]
I tried, but his men came in the night and robbed my farm. I want my crops and I want that bastard's blood.

Id: [0x0024992C]
The midwife from the village usually comes for plants I grow for her <i>pharmika, </i>but she's very late.

Id: [0x0024992D]
Do you think something has happened to her?

Id: [0x0024992E]
I hope not, but she usually comes up through the barley field. I did see a wolf running through there the other day...

Id: [0x00249930]
There's wild mandrake that grows out in one of my fields. A witch gathers it sometimes. I don't use the mandrake, so I don't mind. [beat]Well, I don't mind that part.

Id: [0x00249931]
What bothers you, then?

Id: [0x00249932]
The witch dances when she collects the mandrake. It's... well, I suppose "provocative" is the word I want. I can't get the farmhands to do any work when she's around. Or my husband.

Id: [0x00249933]
That's a problem. But I'm not going to kill her for dancing.

Id: [0x00249934]
No! I just want the mandrake gone. Before my husband volunteers to start delivering it...

Id: [0x00249938]
We're luckier than most here - our barley is valuable to the invading Spartans. They probably won't kill us. I worry for next season, though.

Id: [0x00249939]
A greater worry than the Spartans?

Id: [0x0024993A]
Starvation, <i>misthios</i>. The Spartans might be reasoned with... or killed. But if we do nothing, we'll live only long enough to keep them fed. There's not enough barley to go around.

Id: [0x0024993C]
After the battle, many of the soldiers ran into the countryside to hide. One we even took in. He's been helping me with the harvest since my husband hurt his back.

Id: [0x00249942]
You took a risk letting a strange soldier into your home, but it sounds like he was trustworthy.

Id: [0x00249944]
Helpful or not, the man is a deserter who abandoned his unit.

Id: [0x00249946]
We have paid for our kindness. Other deserters came. Some looking for work, but most to steal or make trouble. Some have begun joining gangs of thieves or bandits. We live in constant fear.

Id: [0x00249948]
The Followers have cursed this land. First, we are robbed, and now the crops barely grow. Cursed, cursed, cursed.

Id: [0x0024994E]
Followers of Ares cause chaos wherever they go.

Id: [0x00249950]
It's not a curse, you're just having a bad season. Tough it out.

Id: [0x00249952]
This is a curse, I'm sure of it. So much blood needs to be spilled to appease the gods. A whole herd of goats. Every blasted Follower. I'd destroy everything just to make my land grow again.

Id: [0x00249954]
I keep honeybees. Bears have always been a nuisance, but this new one is big, mean, and more aggressive every day. I saw it prowling nearby. I'm afraid it's about to strike.

Id: [0x00249956]
There's a rogue lion that has taken to patrolling my fields and eyeing my goats. [beat]That happens. But now there's a rogue lion hunter who has taken to drinking in the town and eyeing my daughters.

Id: [0x00249957]
Two beastly problems.

Id: [0x00249958]
If the lion were killed, the hunter would leave. And if the hunter were killed, I don't think I'd mind the lion all that much.

Id: [0x0024995A]
This is my land, <i>misthios</i>. Unlike those pampered Athenian women, perioeci women hold land, and we work it. My eldest daughter will farm here after me. I won't be chased off.

Id: [0x0024995B]
Who is trying to chase you off?

Id: [0x0024995C]
Bandits. They've grown strong since the Spartan leader's death. Their chief is demanding a "tax" from the farms in the area and is threatening to send his men against any farmer who won't pay.

Id: [0x0024995E]
Oh! <i>Misthios</i>, that belt knife - my son wears one like it. Did you... have you have seen my son?

Id: [0x0024995F]
This? Oh. I found this... on a body.

Id: [0x00249960]
That evil bandit scum. My son, he is... <i>was</i> a strong boy, and the bandits wanted him to join up with them. He went to plead with their leader to let him stay here on the farm and they... gods. My boy...

Id: [0x00249966]
We're good citizens. My children and my husband, we all work hard to make good wine. We even share with the local soldiers... to a point.

Id: [0x00249967]
What point is that?

Id: [0x00249968]
The old commander was a good guest. Never drank too much or imposed. The new commander carries off an amphora of our best vintage every time he comes. Sends his men for more. My hospitality has limits.

Id: [0x0024996A]
The Athenians taking control of this land has been a disaster. The Spartans of the city don't treat the farmers as equals, but at least we were protected.

Id: [0x0024996B]
What do you need protection from?

Id: [0x0024996C]
Everything. The Athenians do nothing. The wolves are not being chased away, the bandits raid freely, and now Followers of Ares infest the land. We are forsaken.

Id: [0x00249977]
I have a shipment of fine wool I've been holding onto until the roads were clear of marauding Spartans, but I can't wait anymore. I don't have anything else for the merchant.

Id: [0x00249978]
Running wool to market? That's... not what I usually do.

Id: [0x00249979]
The area is crawling with aggressive soldiers spoiling for a fight. I don't think the trip will bore you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024997B]
It's a bad world, <i>misthios</i>. The invasion has reduced us all to desperate times. The bandits and wolves were bad enough. But now the soldiers who were to protect us prey upon us.

Id: [0x0024997C]
You've been attacked?

Id: [0x0024997D]
Not yet, but it's only a matter of time. Our neighbors have been ransacked and looted. The man who used to talk with my husband in the mornings was eaten. And the roads and fields are full of monsters.

Id: [0x00249995]
Gods! We pray to you, we beg your mercy. We beg for justice.

Id: [0x00249996]
They treat us worse than dogs. They kill us without reason. We can't live like this.

Id: [0x002499E7]
Tell me about Chrysis.

Id: [0x002499E8]
She learned very quickly, was very strong-willed, and before too long it was the priests who listened to her.

Id: [0x002499E9]
She was loved. But there's an anger in her heart that could not be soothed. So when her methods turned to madness, anyone who opposed her got...

Id: [0x002499EA]
Got what?

Id: [0x002499EB]
I've already said too much.

Id: [0x002499ED]
A very powerful, dangerous woman. But it was not always so. She was abandoned here as a child and taken in by the priests. Taught the ways of the gods.

Id: [0x00249BD3]
[coughs]My parents are afraid. [coughs]I'm not. One day, I'm going to be a hunter like Artemis[cough].

Id: [0x00249BDF]
[coughs]Curse the gods. Who will take care of my farm when I'm gone[coughs]?

Id: [0x00249BE3]
So cold. So very cold. Cruel gods, watch over my little ones[coughs].

Id: [0x00249E7E]
Soldiers have captured a lion in their camp. I pass it on my way to the fountains and I can't stand seeing what they've done to such a proud beast.

Id: [0x00249E81]
My father farms in the countryside, on land that's been taken by the Athenians.

Id: [0x00249E82]
The war is everywhere.

Id: [0x00249E83]
I know, but I am worried for him. He is strong, but when they attack him - and they will soon with that mouth of his - he will need help.

Id: [0x00249E85]
The soldiers are scrambling with the death of their leader. They are spread thin.

Id: [0x00249E86]
You are worried the city is vulnerable to attack?

Id: [0x00249E87]
We are Spartans. We are never vulnerable. But we must all take action against these bold bandits and huntresses. Send them limping back to their trees.

Id: [0x00249E89]
A soldier rejected the match my husband proposed for our beautiful daughter. Married a buzzard of a girl instead for her family's wealth.

Id: [0x00249E8F]
Sometimes the best match is not the best offer.

Id: [0x00249E91]
Sad that he would settle for a worse match just for drachmae.

Id: [0x00249E93]
If that insult wasn't enough, I heard the girl at the fountain laughing about my family's rejection. They will have no children, I swear that.

Id: [0x00249E95]
My husband is a commander - a good man, but too honest. Others get advancement through whatever opportunities they can, but not him.

Id: [0x00249E96]
What kind of "opportunities"?

Id: [0x00249E97]
His rival for a promotion - he leaves food and weapons poorly guarded. I've seen them. Why, anyone could damage them. That would look bad for his rival. But my husband wouldn't think of that.

Id: [0x00249E9B]
The Athenians defeated the soldiers and killed most of the men. But they are fools if they think they are safe now.

Id: [0x00249E9C]
What are you planning?

Id: [0x00249E9D]
Spartan women are not like weak Athenian women. We have money, and property, and rage. I will use all to strike at their commanders, soldiers, and fleet.

Id: [0x00249EA1]
The workshop I spin at produces the finest cloth in all of Athens.

Id: [0x00249EA2]
But not humility?

Id: [0x00249EA3]
Why be humble when we can be great? So great that others copy us with cheap work to sell to the sailing merchants at the docks as if it were our own...

Id: [0x00249EA5]
With a new leader may come new opportunities. We have rights here outside the main city, but we are not yet full "citizens."

Id: [0x00249EA6]
But you want to be?

Id: [0x00249EA7]
Yes. I have a bit of money set aside to... convince a politician. I think now is the time to make the attempt.

Id: [0x00249EA9]
My son left as a soldier, but he did not return.

Id: [0x00249EAA]
Many have died in this war. My sympathies.

Id: [0x00249EAB]
You don't understand, I am a Spartan mother. If he dies as a warrior, I do not grieve. But he did not come back as a man or a corpse.

Id: [0x00249EAC]
He could have been captured... or his body was left behind?

Id: [0x00249EAD]
Yes. But a mother knows her son. I fear he was among the deserters. I will not be a mother to a coward. I despise them all, and if he's one of them...

Id: [0x00249EAF]
I had a string of beads just like that one you have there, <i>misthios</i>. They were stolen.

Id: [0x00249EB0]
I found it on a bandit I killed.

Id: [0x00249EB1]
Good for you. The rest of the string is still out there, then. The beads aren't worth anything, but... they were a gift.

Id: [0x00249EB3]
There is a symposium we are planning. I must find acceptable wine and food.

Id: [0x00249EB4]
I’m not doing your shopping for you...

Id: [0x00249EB5]
What? Oh, no, my husband and I are finding interesting people for the banquet. Soldiers and musicians have the best stories. I must extend invitations to some.

Id: [0x00249EB7]
At the fountains another woman offered to help me with my amphora since I also had a heavy basket. She was very chatty. I didn't know her, but it was nice to talk and have help.

Id: [0x00249EB8]
So what happened?

Id: [0x00249EB9]
While I was talking to her, someone helped themselves to my purchases. Then she left quickly after I discovered the theft. I think she set me up to be robbed!

Id: [0x00249EBB]
All thieves are bold since our leader died. Bastards dare to come into my home?!

Id: [0x00249EBC]
You were robbed?

Id: [0x00249EBD]
Thieves! Bandits! Bastards. They violate my household and make off with the vase given to me for my wedding... Death is too kind for them!

Id: [0x00249EBF]
I am alone since my husband's unit left for the battlefields. There... is a letter I would like to send.

Id: [0x00249EC0]
It's cheaper to hire a messenger than a mercenary.

Id: [0x00249EC1]
Yes, but messengers aren't as discreet. You see, the man in the unit I want to send the letter to is not my husband.

Id: [0x00249EC2]
Oh? Oh!

Id: [0x00249EC3]
Yes. I think my husband suspects, and I want to warn him. If the warning reaches him before my husband's men move on him, so much the better. If not, he will need protection.

Id: [0x00249EC5]
There are spies in the streets, <i>misthios</i>. The soldiers don't notice - they aren't here enough to know. They go home or they go to war. But the women know who belongs in the city.

Id: [0x00249EC6]
And you're sure they are spies?

Id: [0x00249EC7]
Yes. I followed one trying to look like a servant. He was asking questions, and I saw him writing things down. What servant writes?

Id: [0x00249EC9]
The herder who supplies wool to the weaver I work for is weak. The weaver is even worse.

Id: [0x00249ECA]
Why do you say that?

Id: [0x00249ECB]
The farmer is being extorted by bandits. So he in turn asks more money from my weaver. They will pay more every time this way. Weak and stupid. Pay a mercenary once, and the problem goes away.

Id: [0x00249ECD]
The shop where I spin wool, it has been terrorized lately by the new garrison.

Id: [0x00249ECE]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00249ECF]
The soldiers, they demand money from the owner and they harass the women. Their commander turns a blind eye. We just want to work in peace.

Id: [0x00249F91]
I've heard whisperings. Rumors and secrets. People say I'm mad... but the gods know I speak the truth!

Id: [0x00249F97]
The truth about what?

Id: [0x00249F98]
Riches, <i>misthios</i>! I know of a cave where many great riches are hidden. But... there are lions there, too.

Id: [0x00249F9A]
I don't have time to listen to your ramblings.

Id: [0x00249F9B]
<i>Misthios</i>, you judge me too quickly. I know of a cave where many great riches are hidden! But... there are lions there, too.

Id: [0x00249FA5]
You won't hold onto your drachmae for long around here, <i>misthios</i>. Thieves take everything! You should be smart like me - I keep my last coin under my tongue! [beat]But they still managed to find it.

Id: [0x00249FA7]
Ah, it's you! I have seen you in my visions, <i>misthios</i>. I can tell you your fortune!

Id: [0x00249FAD]
The gods have granted you divine sight?

Id: [0x00249FAF]
You don’t know the will of the gods.

Id: [0x00249FB1]
Ah, there is much you don't know, Eagle Bearer. But, I know where you can find the answers you seek. I can see it!

Id: [0x00249FB2]
What answers?

Id: [0x00249FB3]
I know of a cave where the truth lies buried in the dark. What's inside this cave will change the course of your future! But you know, it wasn't easy for me to find this place for you.

Id: [0x00249FB5]
The Followers have so much drachmae! The barking mad among the rich send donations to appease Ares.

Id: [0x00249FB6]
Many hope the gods will smile on them.

Id: [0x00249FB7]
What good are the gods to us now, <i>misthios</i>? People need drachmae. The gods do not!

Id: [0x00249FB9]
Another man keeps begging around here. This is my road! I won't have any food or drachmae if this keeps up.

Id: [0x00249FBB]
I have nothing, <i>misthios</i>... not even bread. But the bandits have plenty of food in their camp.

Id: [0x00249FBD]
These rags are the only clothes I have. Bandits have taken everything from us... even our wool. I can't go on like this.

Id: [0x00249FBF]
A man in the village has a large herd of goats. If I could buy one... or if something happened to them, I could finally scavenge something better to eat than withered radish leaves.

Id: [0x00249FC1]
I used to be respected, <i>misthios</i>. But a little gambling ruined everything... No drachmae means no place to sleep.

Id: [0x00249FC7]
A little bad luck can ruin anyone.

Id: [0x00249FCA]
You were a fool to gamble with your fate.

Id: [0x00249FCC]
Athens has abandoned me, <i>misthios</i>. I was accused of trying to destroy a shrine, and now I have nothing. I have lost my citizenship!

Id: [0x00249FCD]
That's a harsh punishment.

Id: [0x00249FCE]
I was framed! Now, I wish I had destroyed it. Or at least had my revenge on the man that framed me.

Id: [0x00249FD0]
The Followers are wasting food, <i>misthios</i>! This can't go on!

Id: [0x00249FD1]
Wasting food? What do you mean?

Id: [0x00249FD2]
They burn food offerings to Ares, while people like me go starving! They must have piles of food in their camp. I'm desperate for food.

Id: [0x00249FD4]
Soldiers take our drachmae with one hand and spear us with the other! There is nothing left for us here.

Id: [0x00249FD6]
A merchant took everything from me. He was supposed to sell my barley and return with drachmae, but he kept it all. [beat]I couldn't afford to pay my share in the syssition. Now, I have nothing.

Id: [0x00249FD7]
It is a great dishonor to be excluded from that feast. Every Spartan man is expected there.

Id: [0x00249FD8]
I know! For not taking part, I'm no longer recognized as a Spartan. [beat]I could try to grab a little food or drachmae from that merchant's boat if something happened to it... or to him.

Id: [0x00249FDA]
I beg, misthios, but I never steal. The bandits around here, they are worse than dogs. With their strength, they could help people - like you do. If I had the drachmae they have stolen...

Id: [0x00249FDB]
What would you do with it?

Id: [0x00249FDC]
Well, I'd have a good meal. I won't lie. But whatever was left, I'd give to the temple! I swear it.

Id: [0x00249FDE]
Deserters who ran from battle have taken refuge in these streets. They are detested by the citizens as cowards, and so they beg and steal.

Id: [0x00249FDF]
So what?

Id: [0x00249FE0]
So it leaves less for those of us who have always begged and stolen. What can I do? I can't fight ex-soldiers, even cowardly ones.

Id: [0x00249FE8]
I am starving, <i>misthios</i>. I come to these fields to eat the plants when I can find nothing else. But now the area is overrun with wolves. I will be their meal soon... if I don't starve first.

Id: [0x00249FEA]
Ah, my idiot brother. He's gone to try and steal food from the bandit camp.

Id: [0x00249FEB]
That's a pretty risky plan...

Id: [0x00249FEC]
We're desperate... and he's crazy. Please, <i>misthios</i>. The bandits will kill him if they find him touching their supplies.

Id: [0x0024A054]
I used to be... more than this. This war has gone badly for me. For my family. And now I beg and scrape.

Id: [0x0024A055]
What is it that you want? Drachmae?

Id: [0x0024A056]
Yes, but not from you. The bastard Spartans who chased me out to this desolate wilderness and took all my drachmae... I want them to pay. And to bleed.

Id: [0x0024A08B]
I want to travel to the festival in the city. The merriment always draws a... fine crowd.

Id: [0x0024A08C]
Then why don't you go?

Id: [0x0024A08D]
Bandits have set up camp along the path there, preying on wealthy festival goers. And that's not even to speak of the beasts plaguing the area.

Id: [0x0024A08F]
Yet another young man swore he would prove himself the sole person worthy of my affection.

Id: [0x0024A090]
That's... nice?

Id: [0x0024A091]
Maybe so, <i>misthios,</i> but I don't think this one will return. The poor fool has gone lion hunting. He is a good client... it would be a shame to lose him.

Id: [0x0024A093]
One of my clients gives me nothing but excuses. I cannot live on such wretched offerings! The other hetaerae all receive beautiful gifts.

Id: [0x0024A094]
It sounds like he's trying to cheat you.

Id: [0x0024A095]
I won't stand for that. Here I am, without so much as a necklace or a new robe – not even a coin for all his promises! The other girls have started mocking me.

Id: [0x0024A097]
A soldier was to meet me here many hours ago. We were to run away from this war together.

Id: [0x0024A09D]
He might still show up. Then you can have your fresh start at life.

Id: [0x0024A09F]
You sure you want to spend your life with a deserter?

Id: [0x0024A0A1]
I know it's foolish. I never thought I would fall in love with a client. I fear the other soldiers found out he was planning to desert. If that's true, they'll kill him!

Id: [0x0024A0A3]
I have a small trinket to send to my brother, to wish him strength in battle. But thieves have been targeting hetaerae in the city, and I worry what may happen to me on the journey there.

Id: [0x0024A0A5]
Pathetic. A client had the nerve to run off with my drachmae. I can't stand for such disrespect.

Id: [0x0024A0B7]
A local politician is losing interest in me. He's my biggest client... but keeping a politican's attention isn't easy. You look clever, <i>misthios</i>. What do you think I should do?

Id: [0x0024A0BD]
I'm sure someone as beautiful as you can find a way to charm him.

Id: [0x0024A0BE]
Flatterer. [beat]I can be very charming to those who are good to me.

Id: [0x0024A0BF]
Then maybe there's something <i>I</i> can do for you.

Id: [0x0024A0C0]
I have a small token for him, but city thieves have been targeting hetaerae lately. [beat]On second thought, if someone attractive were to deliver it, he would be jealous. Say... a big, strong misthios?

Id: [0x0024A0C2]
If he's losing interest, it's better to cut your losses. Look for a new client.

Id: [0x0024A0C3]
I am.

Id: [0x0024A0C4]
Who?

Id: [0x0024A0C5]
Ugh. Never mind. This small token should remind him of our time together. But... city thieves have been targeting hetaerae lately.

Id: [0x0024A0C7]
Can you believe a client was dim enough to try tricking me?

Id: [0x0024A0C8]
What happened?

Id: [0x0024A0C9]
After spewing some story about how he couldn't pay just yet, he went back to his boat, claiming he would return with jewelry. But he hasn't. The fool doesn't realize I know exactly where the boat is.

Id: [0x0024A0CB]
A philosopher has been spewing nonsense to shame my fellow hetaerae and me to the people. He's driving clients away!

Id: [0x0024A0CC]
How so?

Id: [0x0024A0CD]
Apparently we poison men's minds. He needs to be sent a message. Or silenced more permanently.

Id: [0x0024A0CF]
A crate of good wine was lost at sea – pirates sank a merchant ship. I need that wine for tonight's banquet.

Id: [0x0024A0D0]
You can probably still get it back... if you don't mind getting wet.

Id: [0x0024A0D1]
Only someone truly brave would wade into those waters now. The pirates are still nearby, and I've heard rumors of a shark spotted close to the port.

Id: [0x0024A0D3]
A man in the city will not leave my friend in peace. He is infatuated, truly... he follows her, begs her...

Id: [0x0024A0D9]
He sounds obsessed with her. Does she... like that?

Id: [0x0024A0DA]
Of course not. What started out as a silly crush has become something much worse. His words now make her think he will do her harm.

Id: [0x0024A0DC]
Sounds disturbing.

Id: [0x0024A0DD]
This is sadly not uncommon for us, <i>misthios</i>. And now, she has grown to fear him. His words have turned threatening.

Id: [0x0024A0DF]
The war has brought this city to ruin. My earnings from this week were stolen in the night!

Id: [0x0024A0E0]
That's not surprising.

Id: [0x0024A0E1]
I'm sure the drachmae was taken by city bandits. Their leader urges them to prey on the hetaerae. [beat]He thinks we are defenseless.

Id: [0x0024A0E3]
My dear friend lent me a beautiful necklace, and I need to return to it to her for an upcoming festival. I fear traveling with it will make me a target for thieves, though.

Id: [0x0024A0F9]
What happened?

Id: [0x0024A103]
Idyia? Prexileos?

Id: [0x0024A11A]
The Athenian commander has requested that I join him at his camp.

Id: [0x0024A11B]
Sounds like a good opportunity for you.

Id: [0x0024A11C]
It is, but only if I arrive in one piece. I hear wolves prowl near the camp, and thieves wait for travelers on the road.

Id: [0x0024A11E]
That... that's not exactly right.

Id: [0x0024A124]
Yes, the island is beautiful. From the Statue of Zeus[2406432], you can see the sea hitting the white beaches and mountains covered in green. But its people suffer because of the war.

Id: [0x0024A125]
Ah, just how it was described to me. The gods simultaneously bless the land and curse the people. Even for gods, your gods are cruel, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024A127]
Its people are the happiest in all the Greek world. They sing and dance into the night, with full bellies and full hearts.

Id: [0x0024A128]
That... isn't how it was described to me at all. The tales go that its lands are among the world's most beautiful, and its people among the most pitiful.

Id: [0x0024A131]
You would not believe the words that fall from men's mouths when they are drunk.

Id: [0x0024A137]
The fools get drunk in your presence? I would not want to miss a second with you.

Id: [0x0024A138]
Then perhaps we should spend some time together. But there is something I must take care of, first.

Id: [0x0024A13A]
That's not all that spews from their mouths.

Id: [0x0024A13B]
Ha! True, <i>misthios</i>. But I know that the Athenian commander would be very interested to hear what I heard last night. He's one of my best clients. But, Spartans guard the route to the Athenian camp.

Id: [0x0024A13D]
Maybe I can help you.

Id: [0x0024A13E]
The Athenian commander is one of my clients, and I know he would be very interested in what I heard last night. But, those cursed Spartans guard the route to the Athenian camp.

Id: [0x0024A146]
Rich strangers were to arrive at the port today, but those cursed pirates prevented their approach. Again.

Id: [0x0024A147]
Is there a lack of rich clients on dry land?

Id: [0x0024A148]
Actually, yes. But even if the newcomers could make it into the port, the Followers and bandits around here would surely deter them.

Id: [0x0024A14A]
Those cursed Followers of Ares are scaring clients away! No one wants to risk passing their shrine to Ares.

Id: [0x0024A151]
Your turn to tell me something. You said a man tried to kill you.

Id: [0x0024A152]
The man who rose up to kill the tyrant Xerxes was named Darius... He was of a new creed of killers, unlike any Persia had known. He was also the man hired to kill me.

Id: [0x0024A153]
Now that's out of the way, you owe <i>me</i> a tale. You said the king killer, Darius, was hired to kill you, too.

Id: [0x0024A154]
He was. By my brother.

Id: [0x0024A155]
Now you tell me, "King" Artaxerxes - how can I believe your story? You don't exactly look like royalty.

Id: [0x0024A156]
[&laughs]Well, that's the point. I am hiding.

Id: [0x0024A157]
OK, I've told you what I remember. Now tell me about yourself. What's a Persian doing here?

Id: [0x0024A158]
Persia and the Greek world are doomed to be opposites - in times of prosperity here, Persians always seem to suffer. And when you are at war with yourselves -

Id: [0x0024A159]
So, I've been to the five places Themistokles told you about in his tales.

Id: [0x0024A15A]
For that, my soul will be eternally grateful. As for <i>my</i> tale, Themistokles died peacefully in Persia, as one of us. I promised him I'd see the places he'd told me about. His stories will live on in me, and now you.

Id: [0x0024A165]
If Athens is a city of statues, then Athena is their guardian. She stands high above everything, on guard over the city.

Id: [0x0024A166]
Yes! Not just standing tall to protect Athens, but to serve as a reminder of the suffering those poor people endured during the invasion.

Id: [0x0024A169]
Oh, it's even better than you can imagine. Made of pure gold. Chip one toe off her, and you'd have enough drachmae to eat for the rest of your life.

Id: [0x0024A16A]
Gold? No, it can't be. I was always told she was bronze, and stood guard over the city of Athens. Mourning the past and protecting the future...

Id: [0x0024A172]
The hetaerae keep the spirit of Aphrodite alive... Usually well into the night.

Id: [0x0024A173]
Exactly as your goddess deserves! When I was younger, I'd lie awake dreaming of what it would be like to go... worship, of course.

Id: [0x0024A181]
It's quiet, mostly. People praying, offering sacrifice. You know, typical sanctuary stuff.

Id: [0x0024A182]
A temple to Aphrodite... quiet? Impossible! Have you even been to the temple?

Id: [0x0024A203]
I have an important message for the Athenian commander... It's concealed inside a dried bear's bladder for complete secrecy.

Id: [0x0024A204]
Why are you hiding the message?

Id: [0x0024A205]
Because, <i>misthios,</i> the message contains information on the Spartans' movements! Unfortunately, this is my last bear bladder. I'll need more.

Id: [0x0024A206]
Does someone sell them?

Id: [0x0024A207]
I usually take them from dead bears I find in the forest. But they've been scarce lately, and I need to get this message to the commander.

Id: [0x0024A209]
I have a votive offering for the temple... it must be brought there soon.

Id: [0x0024A20A]
What are you praying for?

Id: [0x0024A20B]
To turn the tides of war, of course. [beat]This is no ordinary offering, <i>misthios.</i> A message hides within that could bring the downfall of enemy forces. But I suspect their spies may be following me.

Id: [0x0024A20D]
I overheard the Athenian soldiers talking about one of Sparta's spies. They were laughing.

Id: [0x0024A20E]
Laughing? Why?

Id: [0x0024A20F]
The spy is traveling to a military camp, but they have paid a <i>misthios</i> to kill him before he gets there!

Id: [0x0024A211]
I overheard some troubling news about the Athenian ships from the merchants. It looks like they've changed direction.

Id: [0x0024A212]
Why is that troubling to you?

Id: [0x0024A213]
Because Sparta won't be expecting an attack! I sent a messenger to tell their commander, but now I've heard that Athenian soldiers are watching for anything leaving the city.

Id: [0x0024A215]
A damaged shrine to Athena would serve as a bad omen for the soldiers' march. But there are too many soldiers tending to it for me to get close.

Id: [0x0024A217]
I've been fed false information by a spy for Sparta. I won't be made a fool, <i>misthios</i>. If Athens is to trust my word again, this Spartan dog must die.

Id: [0x0024A218]
Why are you telling me?

Id: [0x0024A219]
I hear he's hiding out in a bandit camp. They know what I look like... I won't be able to get close.

Id: [0x0024A21B]
A spy found out who killed the local commander, and he's on his way to tell the Athenians. The message must not be delivered!

Id: [0x0024A21C]
How do you know that?

Id: [0x0024A21D]
I have my ways, <i>misthios</i>. Men think their words mean nothing to women's ears.

Id: [0x0024A21F]
Have you heard about the Athenian soldiers? So many of them are strangely ill... They have to leave their camps.

Id: [0x0024A220]
What's wrong with them?

Id: [0x0024A221]
They've had a helping hand from nature. [beat]And from me. My vermillion mixture allows them to fake a serious illness. At this rate, Athenian deserters will outnumber those who remain.

Id: [0x0024A222]
That's clever. I'm sure Sparta will thank you.

Id: [0x0024A223]
I hope to last that long. I've heard whisperings... I think the remaining Athenians know what I've been doing. [beat]And I still have one more mixture to deliver.

Id: [0x0024A225]
These fresh cakes will delight our local statesman. So long as they reach him in secret.

Id: [0x0024A226]
Secret cakes? Why?

Id: [0x0024A227]
Athens wants this man dead, and I am only too happy to oblige. These sweet cakes will be his last meal... unless his spies find out where they came from.

Id: [0x0024A229]
Soldiers have captured a friend of mine, a hunter.

Id: [0x0024A22A]
What would soldiers want with a hunter?

Id: [0x0024A22B]
They discovered he was providing dried bladders to spies. It's a wonderful way to conceal a message, <i>misthios</i>. [beat]I used to get many bladders from him.

Id: [0x0024A22D]
A woman in the village has been hiding secret messages in her herd of goats.

Id: [0x0024A233]
That's a... unique kind of delivery.

Id: [0x0024A234]
This must be stopped. She hides the letters in the bellies of fresh goat carcasses.

Id: [0x0024A236]
Are you sure about this?

Id: [0x0024A237]
It's true, <i>misthios</i>. She has been selling goat carcasses to spies with letters hidden inside.

Id: [0x0024A239]
My husband has been captured by bandits. They think he is a spy, and those <i>malákes</i> know the Spartans will reward them for his capture.

Id: [0x0024A23A]
Being a spy is dangerous work.

Id: [0x0024A23B]
It is, but he's not even a spy! [beat]It was me. I can't let this happen, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024A2C2]
Athenian ships are on their way to shore, but it's too late to warn anyone!

Id: [0x0024A2C3]
Too late? You're a wonderful spy.

Id: [0x0024A2C4]
Now really isn't the time for sarcasm, <i>misthios</i>. I sent the wrong code to the Spartan commander and... well, we need to act now!

Id: [0x0024A2C5]
We?

Id: [0x0024A2C6]
You'll leave me to handle this alone, mercenary?

Id: [0x0024A2C8]
Bandits have stolen my earrings, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024A2C9]
Just your earrings? Count yourself lucky they didn't kill you.

Id: [0x0024A2CA]
This isn't an ordinary pair of earrings.

Id: [0x0024A2CB]
What makes them so special? Were they a gift from a lover?

Id: [0x0024A2CC]
No. [beat]The set was inscribed with an important message for the Athenian commander. It's easy to use jewelry to send secret messages. The men never bother to look.

Id: [0x0024A2CE]
A merchant's been robbed, <i>misthios</i>! He was supposed to sell a bridle to me today... I need it.

Id: [0x0024A2CF]
Then buy one from someone else. Why do you care that a merchant was robbed?

Id: [0x0024A2D0]
This bridle... [beat]It contains secret information about Sparta's next move, but bandits have it in their camp.

Id: [0x0024A2D3]
My husband is a herald. An urgent message must reach his spy, but I fear soldiers may be watching for me.

Id: [0x0024A2D5]
I must deliver this hetaera's sandals, but there are so many spies around. I can't go myself.

Id: [0x0024A2D6]
Why would spies care about sandals? Plenty of shoemakers make deliveries to the hetaerae.

Id: [0x0024A2D7]
These sandals... [beat]I've sewn a message from Sparta within their soles. If all goes well, the hetaera's next night with the Athenian commander will be his last. But this message must stay safe.

Id: [0x0024A2EA]
Your plan failed, Elpenor. Soon you will join your imposter.

Id: [0x0024A2ED]
Elpenor knew I would come for him. Used that imposter to lure me into a trap.

Id: [0x0024A2F2]
So much for using finesse.

Id: [0x0024A5C6]
I told my husband not to go fishing today - sharks and pirates have been spotted in these waters. But he didn't listen. Stubborn old fool. He hasn't come back yet.

Id: [0x0024A5C8]
Another fisher keeps fishing in my waters!

Id: [0x0024A5C9]
Tell her to back off.

Id: [0x0024A5CA]
She will not listen to me. But if something were to happen to her boat... or her, she would soon be out of business.

Id: [0x0024A5CC]
I have a crate of dried fish to deliver to the soldiers, but my messenger has not arrived. I'm worried he's been beset by thieves...

Id: [0x0024A5CE]
I need to go fishing, but there are pirate boats in the bay.

Id: [0x0024A5D0]
A crate of fishing nets fell from my boat. I need to get them back, but the ocean is teeming with sharks.

Id: [0x0024A5D2]
My son died in the battle at sea. Or he went into the water and then died when the sharks came. I don't know. I just know he never came to shore.

Id: [0x0024A5D3]
You can be proud that he died a soldier.

Id: [0x0024A5D4]
Yes, but I wish I had his body to bury. Or even just his shield if that's all that's left. It's decorated with little coins his brothers gave him. I'd try diving for it if not for the sharks.

Id: [0x0024A5D6]
Pirates don't usually attack the fishers - we don't have enough worth stealing - but they don't like us fishing too close to "their" waters.

Id: [0x0024A5D7]
Did someone get too close?

Id: [0x0024A5D8]
One of the men went down to fish near pirate territory last night and hasn't returned. I'm afraid they've taken him, or worse.

Id: [0x0024A5DA]
There have been Followers performing rituals at a shrine by the shore.

Id: [0x0024A5DB]
What are they after here?

Id: [0x0024A5DC]
I have no idea, but I'm scared of these Followers. I've written a message to notify the commander, but I'm afraid I might not get past them to bring it to him.

Id: [0x0024A5DE]
There's a fisherman from further up the coast... There's been trouble up there. So he's starting fishing my waters to avoid pirates and brigands.

Id: [0x0024A5E4]
So long as the fishing is good for everyone, I see no harm in that.

Id: [0x0024A5E7]
If you were fishing these waters first, then you should push him out.

Id: [0x0024A5E9]
We fish at night - catch spoils too fast in the heat of the day. But the darkness makes us vulnerable. Usually it's just sharks, but even the pirates are desperate since the soldiers invaded.

Id: [0x0024A5EB]
Fishing is a hard life, <i>misthios</i>. There's plenty of fish, but it spoils in the heat. It's hard to get it to market. The salters could preserve my catch, but they won't.

Id: [0x0024A5EC]
Why not?

Id: [0x0024A5ED]
There are too many fishermen working this port. Too much fish to salt. If there were fewer boats in the water, fewer baskets of fish waiting for salt... maybe then my catch would have a chance.

Id: [0x0024A5EF]
All of the city is in chaos. The port especially. Without leadership, the soldiers are taking whatever they can get from the citizens.

Id: [0x0024A5F0]
You're worried they will come down to the docks and take your fish?

Id: [0x0024A5F1]
Not here, maybe, but if the fish pass right in front of them, they might. I want to send my fish to market, but I'm afraid the boy who runs them won't make it past the soldiers.

Id: [0x0024A5F3]
Fish stink.

Id: [0x0024A5F9]
I'm surprised you noticed it. Is there any chance you could stand downwind?

Id: [0x0024A5FB]
Well, yes, fish do stink. That's not really news though, is it?

Id: [0x0024A5FD]
Oh good. A funny mercenary. As if the bears and wolves weren't bad enough.

Id: [0x0024A5FE]
Bears?

Id: [0x0024A5FF]
The fish stink! What did I just tell you? So the beasts come down to steal our catch when it's piled up. They'll attack again soon...

Id: [0x0024A601]
Most of the fishing we do here is with nets, but every so often I spear a tunny. Even the odd shark.

Id: [0x0024A602]
I know a little something about spearwork.

Id: [0x0024A603]
I stuck a big shark last night, but the bastard got away. Knocked over a crate of my nets with him and nearly took me. I need those nets, but I'm not going into shark infested waters to get them.

Id: [0x0024A605]
Sometimes we take the fish alive in creels. Keeps them as fresh as possible to take to market, especially in this heat.

Id: [0x0024A606]
Makes sense.

Id: [0x0024A607]
Yeah, but it also means the creels are already-packed baskets for thieves to carry away... The bandits seem to appreciate the freshness of my catch lately.

Id: [0x0024A609]
My son's body washed up on shore with a shark tooth lodged in his chest. A curse on all sharks! Oh, how can I tell his brother? How can I show him this wicked tooth? The gods are cruel.

Id: [0x0024A60B]
The soldiers that have taken control of this port are brutal. They took my entire catch yesterday before I could salt it, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024A60C]
That's terrible. I'm sure you were counting on those fish.

Id: [0x0024A60D]
No, in this heat, unsalted fish would have spoiled before they got to camp. If they were hungry enough to attack me, today they'll be starving and furious. I heard they're already on their way.

Id: [0x0024A625]
Fuck up like that again, and I'll draw blood.

Id: [0x0024A697]
You see my hands, <i>misthios</i>? I have been a slave since childhood. My parents sold me to pay their debts.

Id: [0x0024A69D]
Sometimes, people don't have much choice.

Id: [0x0024A69F]
Parents often make bad choices.

Id: [0x0024A6A1]
I hear they live well now. My father makes good drachmae as a merchant sailing from port to port. I've paid for his wealth with my sweat and blood.

Id: [0x0024A6A3]
Lions have attacked my master's goats three times this week!

Id: [0x0024A6A9]
You need to keep a closer eye on the goats.

Id: [0x0024A6AB]
Does your master expect you to be a shepherd or a lion-tamer?

Id: [0x0024A6AD]
He's sending men to beat me for my negligence. And if I lose more goats... the lions may as well take me, too.

Id: [0x0024A6AF]
To get something from them. A deed to some land, I think he said.

Id: [0x0024A6B0]
Well, that's something. What else?

Id: [0x0024A6B1]
Good to know. Thank you, Phoibe the spy.

Id: [0x0024A6B2]
Not bad, huh?

Id: [0x0024A6B4]
My master has ordered me to give an important message to the Athenian commander.

Id: [0x0024A6B5]
Let me guess, you're worried that the Spartans will take the message from you?

Id: [0x0024A6B6]
The Spartans? No, misthios. They will never find this message - my master tattooed it onto my head and let my hair grow back to cover it.

Id: [0x0024A6BC]
By Zeus, that must have been terrible to endure.

Id: [0x0024A6BE]
<i>Maláka</i>! What a bastard.

Id: [0x0024A6C0]
The deed is done, <i>misthios</i>. Now, I am the only one who can deliver my master's message. But I fear the wolves and bandits that prowl along the way.

Id: [0x0024A6C2]
My village was raided, and a pirate forced me across the sea to here. I was once a free man! This... this is wrong.

Id: [0x0024A6C3]
Those cursed <i>malákes</i> make a lot of drachmae this way.

Id: [0x0024A6C4]
But, what am I now, <i>misthios</i>? A slave to other men by bad luck alone. This pirate must be stopped - he captures many this way, and spends his days selling slaves near his boat or drinking in taverns.

Id: [0x0024A6C6]
My master has asked me to drive bears and wolves off his land. But I'm afraid, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024A6C8]
The Spartans treat us like playthings. They murder countless helots every year, and for what?

Id: [0x0024A6C9]
That has always been the Spartan way.

Id: [0x0024A6CA]
Their new hunt has just begun. I'm not as fast as I used to be, <i>misthios</i>. Would you let them kill me for sport?

Id: [0x0024A6CC]
With enough drachmae, I could buy my freedom. Otherwise, something tragic needs to happen to my master.

Id: [0x0024A6D0]
Now get the fuck out of here, before I get this traitor's blood on your robes.

Id: [0x0024A6D1]
Cursed soldiers brought me here as a slave when my city fell. I had a good house, some land... Now I have nothing.

Id: [0x0024A6D2]
War takes something from everyone.

Id: [0x0024A6D3]
My brother fled when I was taken. I don't know what's become of him... maybe the soldiers captured him, too.

Id: [0x0024A6D5]
I was brought here from far away to serve the Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x0024A6D6]
You don't sound happy.

Id: [0x0024A6D7]
These gods are not my gods. I don't want to tend to their impious shrine. But, if I rebel, the Followers will punish me.

Id: [0x0024A6D9]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>, the rest of my days will be short and dark. My master has sent me to work in the mines.

Id: [0x0024A6DA]
That's grim work.

Id: [0x0024A6DB]
I won't last long down there. I'm not as strong as my master thinks! [beat]I could get away if something happened to him. Or... maybe I could buy my freedom if I had some drachmae.

Id: [0x0024A6DD]
My master has been accused of a crime, and... he has offered my word in evidence.

Id: [0x0024A6DE]
What do you plan to say?

Id: [0x0024A6DF]
Truth or lie, it doesn't matter! The magistrate will have me tortured in my master's defense. The soldiers are coming for me now!

Id: [0x0024A6E1]
You see my brand, <i>misthios</i>? It says I'm a runaway, and the soldiers have seen it. More are coming for me... I'll never make it past them!

Id: [0x0024A6E3]
Please, <i>misthios,</i> I can't return to the city. Fugitive slaves are harshly punished.

Id: [0x0024A6E9]
Keep moving, but stay off the main path.

Id: [0x0024A6EA]
I want to, but I've heard wolves howling in the wilds. People say there are bears nearby, too!

Id: [0x0024A6EC]
Go back. You won't survive alone out here.

Id: [0x0024A6ED]
I have to try. But... I've heard wolves howling in the wilds. People say there are bears nearby, too!

Id: [0x0024A6EF]
The Spartans are angry. They say I have too much pride in my clothes.

Id: [0x0024A6F5]
The Spartan hate for helots is strong.

Id: [0x0024A6F7]
Keeping your head down and your clothes bland might save your life.

Id: [0x0024A6F9]
These are the only clothes I have. They say they will remind me of my place. They're coming soon to beat me... maybe even kill me!

Id: [0x0024A6FB]
My master sent me to get this pig iron from the smelter. He needs it straightaway!

Id: [0x0024A6FC]
You're a forge slave?

Id: [0x0024A6FD]
Yes, and iron is needed by many. I'm afraid thieves will snatch it from me on the way.

Id: [0x0024A6FF]
Look at me, <i>misthios</i>. A once proud Skythian, now owned by Athens. Reduced to keeping the peace for these <i>malákes</i>.

Id: [0x0024A700]
That's terrible.

Id: [0x0024A701]
Do you know how it feels to be forced against my own people? Right now, a fellow Skythian rots, captured by Athenian soldiers.

Id: [0x0024A703]
Please, <i>misthios</i>. My master plans to exchange me for a crate of wine from a merchant's boat.

Id: [0x0024A709]
Trading a person for a crate of wine is disgusting.

Id: [0x0024A70B]
If your master is so willing to trade, maybe it's best to move on from him.

Id: [0x0024A70D]
I don't want to be exchanged. Rumor is, the merchant's a cruel man. If something were to happen to his boat... or the merchant himself, the deal would be off.

Id: [0x0024A711]
You're meeting someone tonight, aren't you? At Phaia's goat farm.

Id: [0x0024A712]
Oh, I...

Id: [0x0024A714]
A goat farm? [&ah]You'll find no goats at Phaia's.

Id: [0x0024A718]
[sigh]Not as fun the third time.

Id: [0x0024A71A]
You're going to Phaia's Pig Farm. And meeting some like-minded person there, I hear.

Id: [0x0024A71B]
Where did you hear that? [beat]You're wrong. Dead wrong.

Id: [0x0024A720]
You have a secret meeting tonight. At Phaia's cow farm.

Id: [0x0024A721]
[&laughs]Cows? You've been given the wrong information, misthios.

Id: [0x0024A722]
What? But...

Id: [0x0024A727]
They have a secret letter to give you.

Id: [0x0024A728]
Nothing? But...

Id: [0x0024A72A]
You're getting a bill of sale.

Id: [0x0024A72B]
[&ah]A bill of sale for what? I've bought nothing.

Id: [0x0024A72C]
I was sure...

Id: [0x0024A72E]
And that's where you're wrong. You have nothing on me.

Id: [0x0024A72F]
They owe you a deed to some land. What that land'll be used for, I don't know.

Id: [0x0024A735]
A spy. What else do you have on me? Cough it up.

Id: [0x0024A73B]
You're meeting someone named Deinomache.

Id: [0x0024A73C]
A <i>woman? </i>Not tonight, <i>misthios</i>. Perhaps another night.

Id: [0x0024A73D]
Wait, I...

Id: [0x0024A73F]
Deinokrates is his name. The man you're meeting.

Id: [0x0024A740]
I know no one called Deinokrates. You almost had me there.

Id: [0x0024A741]
What?

Id: [0x0024A743]
Deinomenes will be quite upset if I don't let you meet him tonight.

Id: [0x0024A746]
How? What do you want?

Id: [0x0024A747]
I know about Damalis. And as her client, you seem to think she owes you something.

Id: [0x0024A7C4]
One cursed <i>agoranomos</i> demands a higher tax each time I come here. I make less drachmae than I pay!

Id: [0x0024A7C6]
Care to look at my wares, <i>misthios</i>? I'll give you a good price! Just... stay a while.

Id: [0x0024A7C7]
Why? What's wrong?

Id: [0x0024A7C8]
Spies think it was my wine that poisoned the Athenian commander and they're coming for me soon. But it's not true! I sell good produce.

Id: [0x0024A7CA]
Those cursed sailors let my crate of wares fall into the sea. I was waiting all week for my delivery!

Id: [0x0024A7D0]
Your crate might still be nearby.

Id: [0x0024A7D2]
It's probably on the ocean floor by now.

Id: [0x0024A7D4]
I can't swim out to look for it... I'm afraid of sharks.

Id: [0x0024A7D6]
If a herbalist had this woad, she could add saffron to it... it would make a beautiful green color. But, I must deliver this madder dye to the craftsman straightaway.

Id: [0x0024A7EA]
Bandits have made it impossible to trade here, <i>misthios</i>! Their leader had them steal my supplies, drachmae... everything!

Id: [0x0024A7EF]
Are you looking for some bread, <i>misthios</i>? Well, forget it! I'm not allowed to trade here anymore.

Id: [0x0024A7F0]
Why not?

Id: [0x0024A7F1]
Another merchant reported me - said my bread was poor quality. Meanwhile, the bread he imports to the docks could double as a rock. That malákas deserves my vengeance.

Id: [0x0024A7F3]
A soldier asked me for a hemlock solution. I believe he means to end his life.

Id: [0x0024A7F4]
Are you sure? Perhaps it's for something else.

Id: [0x0024A7F5]
He's been a soldier all his life, but this war has crippled him. I think he feels he has nothing left to live for. [beat]He comes by my stall every week, and every week he seems sadder than before.

Id: [0x0024A7FB]
It's terrible what this war has driven some people to do.

Id: [0x0024A7FD]
I understand this is difficult, but is it really your decision to make?

Id: [0x0024A7FF]
I won't help him do this, <i>misthios</i>. [beat]I've written him a letter instead. I want him to know someone still cares.

Id: [0x0024A801]
I was to sell wool at my stall today, but it never arrived from the workshop. I fear it's been stolen by bandits, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024A803]
This sweet iris perfume must be delivered to the hetaerae at once, but a craftsman needs his dye now... I can't do both!

Id: [0x0024A805]
A priestess asked me to paint this pot for the temple. The whole city will see my work!

Id: [0x0024A80B]
You must be proud.

Id: [0x0024A80D]
I have bigger concerns than pottery, merchant.

Id: [0x0024A80F]
I really need to get this to her but... if the shrine was ruined, she would need even more pots from me.

Id: [0x0024A811]
Cursed thieves! They stole one of my painted pots and broke the rest. I don't have the drachmae for more supplies.

Id: [0x0024A813]
There's a merchant here undercutting me. He's putting me out of business!

Id: [0x0024A819]
That's terrible. What will you do?

Id: [0x0024A81A]
I'd be grateful for a happy accident... against him or his wares.

Id: [0x0024A81C]
If you can't handle competition, you're not cut out for business.

Id: [0x0024A81D]
This is all I have, <i>misthios</i>! If only something were to happen to that <i>malákas</i>... Or his wares.

Id: [0x0024A81F]
Wolves come in the night, <i>misthios</i>. They kill my goats. Soon I will have no cheese to sell.

Id: [0x0024A820]
Just set some wolf traps.

Id: [0x0024A821]
The Daughters of Artemis keep destroying my traps. They say wolves must be allowed to hunt.

Id: [0x0024A823]
A spy has asked me to deliver this chest of clothing to her... but the soldiers must not see it.

Id: [0x0024A824]
You're delivering clothing to spies?

Id: [0x0024A825]
No ordinary clothes, <i>misthios</i>. This dress is a special delivery for the lady - there are secret messages embroidered within its folds.

Id: [0x0024A827]
And it says more... That he needs to bring Damalis to a place here in Korinth. There's directions. What do you think it is?

Id: [0x0024A82E]
My husband received a document - a shipping contract. I don't want him to sail to Athens.

Id: [0x0024A82F]
Why not?

Id: [0x0024A830]
Those <i>malákes</i> can't be trusted! The war is everywhere! He should stay and trade here with me.

Id: [0x0024A832]
A local politician asked around for <i>nardos</i> perfume... the kind used to make tablets for fresh breath!

Id: [0x0024A833]
He must plan to talk a lot.

Id: [0x0024A834]
If I'm lucky, I'll deliver it to him before the other merchants get theirs off the boats.

Id: [0x0024A836]
Where did you get that hat? That's mine! It's from my stolen wares.

Id: [0x0024A837]
Your stock was stolen?

Id: [0x0024A838]
Yes... Bandits took a full chest of my supplies. But maybe they haven't gotten far, after all.

Id: [0x0024A8C3]
You made it.

Id: [0x0024A8C4]
And fast. I know all the shortcuts now. [beat]I'm sorry, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0024A8C7]
I told Kassandra she shouldn't have!

Id: [0x0024A8CC]
These bastard Spartan soldiers. With the men gone or dead, they think they can do whatever they want. They think they are safe from vengeance.

Id: [0x0024A8CD]
Foolish. With so many hurt by this war, vengeance always finds a way.

Id: [0x0024A8CE]
The commander is brutal, and his men are murderous bastards. The gods must see them punished.

Id: [0x0024A8D0]
My husband died in battle. A hero. A Spartan. But not all are so lucky.

Id: [0x0024A8D1]
Only a Spartan would consider that lucky.

Id: [0x0024A8D2]
There is an Athenian unit known for taking prisoners. They may even have one now. They dishonor a Spartan warrior by not allowing him to die gloriously like my beloved.

Id: [0x0024A8D4]
Soldiers come and soldiers go. Spartans, Athenians. But babies don't wait for the dust to settle. They come when the gods will them to.

Id: [0x0024A8D5]
Expecting deliveries?

Id: [0x0024A8D6]
Any day for a couple of births. Any moment. But soldiers have confiscated my medicines. Say they're "inspecting" all goods in their new conquest. Babies don't wait for inspections.

Id: [0x0024A8D8]
The Followers have a shrine in this cave. It pollutes the land with its foul miasma. I fear for the babies with such impurity in the air.

Id: [0x0024A8D9]
And you came to do what? Midwife them to death?

Id: [0x0024A8DA]
I thought to scare them off somehow, but my courage failed me when I saw all the Followers.

Id: [0x0024A8DC]
There's a woman about to give birth any minute, but I'll never make it to her with these cursed wolves prowling.

Id: [0x0024A8DE]
The wife of a soldier gave birth and told me her husband is a traitor - he is selling secrets, and they are going to flee the city.

Id: [0x0024A8DF]
Why would she tell you that?

Id: [0x0024A8E0]
Pain and fear of death make some talkative. But now that she is recovering her strength, she'll tell her husband... and I'll be killed.

Id: [0x0024A8E2]
My mother and her mother were midwives. But my daughter, she wanted to create. I told her midwives bring life into the world. What else is there for creation?

Id: [0x0024A8E3]
A noble argument.

Id: [0x0024A8E4]
It fell on deaf ears. She is an artist. A great genius. She needs money sent to her, of course. I have little enough of my own without supporting her.

Id: [0x0024A8E6]
A baby has been born, but the elders have ordered it be exposed. I couldn't bring myself to leave the child to die.

Id: [0x0024A8E7]
What have you done?

Id: [0x0024A8E8]
A farmer wanted a child but could not conceive. I brought the baby to her. But I fear the elders know. They will send soldiers. I have a warning for her, but I fear I may soon be too late.

Id: [0x0024A8EA]
The wife of a commander I have worked for is pregnant again. If the child lives, the father will name it for the deceased leader.

Id: [0x0024A8EB]
That's... patriotic.

Id: [0x0024A8EC]
No, he is ambitious and wants the friends of the dead to look favorably on him. But he's also made his wife a target. The whisper is that a mercenary has been sent for her by his political rivals.

Id: [0x0024A8EE]
I must arrange for an olive wreath to be placed on her door. The woman I attended has given birth to a son.

Id: [0x0024A8F4]
That's wonderful, midwife. And he is healthy? How is the mother?

Id: [0x0024A8F6]
How do I make drachmae from this news, midwife?

Id: [0x0024A8F8]
The mother and son are strong, so there is work to be done. The father is a commander - a message must be delivered to him. And a sacrifice of goats must be made to thank the gods.

Id: [0x0024A8FC]
<i>Misthios</i>, you have a root of the <i>kyklaminos</i> there. It is used as a protection.

Id: [0x0024A8FD]
Oh, this? I took it off a dead body.

Id: [0x0024A8FE]
It isn't protection against mercenaries. I make amulets from it - I have one here for a woman in the village who has great pain.

Id: [0x0024A8FF]
And your amulet will protect her from the pain?

Id: [0x0024A900]
If I can get it to her. I have been pursued by bandits who want my talismans.

Id: [0x0024A902]
The herbs and medicines I use to treat the women after childbirth - the commander has demanded them.

Id: [0x0024A903]
What use does he have for them?

Id: [0x0024A904]
Perhaps as medicines for other complaints. Maybe he has a woman, I have no idea. I don't care, either. I just don't want his soldiers attacking me for medicines my patients need.

Id: [0x0024A90C]
That talisman to Artemis you have - I leave those with the mothers whose babies I deliver. Where did you get that?

Id: [0x0024A90D]
On the body of a bandit... He must have had business with one of your mothers.

Id: [0x0024A90E]
Monsters. Preying on women and children because no one will stop them out here. And to take a worthless charm like that. I wonder if other of my talismans are held by those bastards.

Id: [0x0024A910]
The woman I just attended to... Artemis pierced her with her arrow to prevent her further suffering.

Id: [0x0024A911]
Arrow? What arrow?

Id: [0x0024A912]
It means she died in childbirth, <i>misthios</i>. But the child lives, thank Artemis. I cannot enter the temple until a sacrifice of goats has been made and a fruit offering brought to the priestess.

Id: [0x0024A914]
Another of the children I helped bring into this world was eaten by wolves. With all the wolves, bears, and lions plaguing this area, I have no tears left for all the children gone.

Id: [0x0024A918]
The soldiers and their commander who have set up camp near the village are tyrants. They control our movements and won't let us leave.

Id: [0x0024A919]
Why do you want to leave? Are you fleeing?

Id: [0x0024A91A]
No, but there are several pregnant women who live outside the village. If the soldiers keep me from helping them, they and their babies will likely die.

Id: [0x0024A91C]
There is a pregnant woman in the village I must attend to. Her time is very soon, but the road is not safe. I have already been robbed by bandits and followed by beasts. I am afraid to go further.

Id: [0x0024AB69]
The great bird with metal feathers attacked me. I fought it off with my bare hands.

Id: [0x0024AB6A]
[&ah]You did? So, you fought it just like Herakles? I'd heard the statue was built to guard a place of chaos and calm.

Id: [0x0024AB6E]
It's a majestic statue, built from the blades of fallen soldiers. It is so high above Stymphalos[2040889] and the golden fields below... Up there I could forget there was a war.

Id: [0x0024AB6F]
So, it is as it was told to me. The bird commemorates Herakles's fight against chaos, built on a place of calm. Hopefully one draws out the best in the other.

Id: [0x0024AB73]
The mountain is just a mountain like any other - what makes Taygetos a place of suffering is the people there.

Id: [0x0024AB74]
I could tell from the moment I met you that you carried the burden of suffering. Let it stay in the past.

Id: [0x0024AB77]
Your story was true - there is a snow god on Mount Taygetos that lives to eat the children of Sparta. It destroys families for fun. I saw it.

Id: [0x0024AB78]
<i>That</i> was a Persian myth, and a disgusting one - I had always hoped to hear the tale of the true Taygetos from someone who'd seen it firsthand.

Id: [0x0024AB7C]
There has been another artist visiting the city, they say. A technique similar to my own, I'm told.

Id: [0x0024AB7D]
You don't enjoy the comparison?

Id: [0x0024AB7E]
I do not enjoy being compared to that amateur. She and the garbage she creates are getting on a merchant ship today... I'd like to make sure she never returns.

Id: [0x0024AB80]
The Spartans who have taken command - they have no appreciation for art.

Id: [0x0024AB81]
It's war. You have bigger things to worry about.

Id: [0x0024AB82]
Maybe you do, but art is my living. If they smash or steal my pots, I have no living.

Id: [0x0024AB84]
I was hired to paint the portrait of a stunning athlete. So, I of course was painting her in the nude.

Id: [0x0024AB85]
Of course. Wait. Which of you do you mean was nude?

Id: [0x0024AB86]
Well. That's the problem. So I have the portrait, but I'm afraid to bring it to her house. Her husband has taken a dislike to me.

Id: [0x0024AB87]
I can't imagine why.

Id: [0x0024AB88]
He has sent threats. Says he'll send a mercenary to kill me. I'm afraid to send the painting, but I'm afraid not to send it and lose my pay. I don't know what to do.

Id: [0x0024AB96]
That is true of all the world's worst places.

Id: [0x0024AB97]
[beat]When I was a child...

Id: [0x0024AB98]
The merchant who I buy the glazes for my pottery from - he never showed up to market today.

Id: [0x0024AB99]
You think something could have happened to him?

Id: [0x0024AB9A]
His route to the village does go through bandit territory. I wouldn't think they would attack him for glazes, but times are tough even for bandits...

Id: [0x0024AB9C]
I've spent my life painting and carving lions without ever actually seeing one. So I came here to study them.

Id: [0x0024AB9D]
How goes your study, then?

Id: [0x0024AB9E]
Oh, mixed results. On the one hand, I can now paint them much better. On the other, I'm pretty sure they are hunting me.

Id: [0x0024ABA0]
A great Spartan has died. A leader who inspired me. I've been creating likenesses of him until my fingers bleed.

Id: [0x0024ABA1]
You're quite devoted to your leaders.

Id: [0x0024ABA2]
I am devoted to Sparta. I want my art in the hands of the commander that let him die as a painful reminder. And as for his inept replacement... Well, I have plans for him, too.

Id: [0x0024ABA4]
I've carved a small bust of our late leader. I want to send it to his friend - one of the politicians here - Kolotos, in hopes he will commission a large memorial statue.

Id: [0x0024ABA5]
Why not just do that, then?

Id: [0x0024ABA6]
Because Kolotos and his party are not without enemies. The Followers of Ares opposed the leader and they will oppose Kolotos. I fear making them my enemies as well, if I'm seen delivering this.

Id: [0x0024ABA8]
I am worried for my patron, <i>misthios</i>. The soldiers are rounding up men they consider a threat of resistance. His wealth may make him a target.

Id: [0x0024ABA9]
And you are concerned for his health... or for your funding?

Id: [0x0024ABAA]
In truth, both. But he is a good man. If they come for him, I fear for his wife and children.

Id: [0x0024ABAC]
Look at this votive figure I found at the market. It's simple, but beautiful. I have not seen its style before.

Id: [0x0024ABAD]
Is it valuable?

Id: [0x0024ABAE]
Not in drachmae, no. But I'm sure the priestess at the temple would appreciate it. So would the Followers of Ares, but they and their dark shrine scare me.

Id: [0x0024ABB1]
I thought I was going to die! I just want to get my pots to the merchant, but these paths are prowled by so many bandits and wolves! I fear more may be coming.

Id: [0x0024ABB3]
I need inspiration, <i>misthios</i>. All I ever paint are scenes on pots of people painting scenes on pots.

Id: [0x0024ABB4]
Do people buy those?

Id: [0x0024ABB5]
Not many. Inspire me. I need a story of a great hunt - wrestle a lion, conquer a bear, master a shark. You do the heroics, I'll do the painting.

Id: [0x0024ABB7]
Our leaders are mortal. Vulnerable and killable. That's never been more apparent.

Id: [0x0024ABB8]
You talk more like a mercenary than an artist.

Id: [0x0024ABB9]
Art is subversion, <i>misthios</i>. And there are more leaders and commanders in Athens who need to be subverted for the good of the people.

Id: [0x0024ABBB]
<i>Misthios</i>, my vase! I worked on that design for weeks. Painting, glazing. All for bandits to knock me down and make off with it. Oh please gods, don't let them smash it.

Id: [0x0024ABBD]
That pottery fragment! It's just like the pots I made not too long ago, but they were all stolen.

Id: [0x0024ABBE]
Well, at least you can know the thief is dead. I found that on a corpse.

Id: [0x0024ABBF]
Justice for the thieves does please me. But if any of these pots survived, that would please me even more.

Id: [0x0024ABC1]
Sparta has little interest in decorative art. They like things utilitarian. In Athens, I was a celebrated artist.

Id: [0x0024ABC2]
Really? Odd that I've never heard of you.

Id: [0x0024ABC3]
Well. At least I wasn't starving. There is a politician who is a barrier to my return to Athens. Well, his wife is the barrier.

Id: [0x0024ABC4]
You could send him some of your art to remind him of you.

Id: [0x0024ABC5]
I could. Or I could send someone to take care of his wife. Either should make him think of me, don't you think?

Id: [0x0024ABC7]
There is a band of thieves trying to extort my workshop, but I won't pay. They may attack me at any moment.

Id: [0x0024ABCD]
Good for you. Don't be intimidated by dogs like that. Strike back.

Id: [0x0024ABCF]
I've seen the bandits in these areas, friend. It is good to be brave, but these are dangerous men.

Id: [0x0024ABD1]
I know, bravery will only get me so far. Or dead. I am an artist, not a fighter. You, though...

Id: [0x0024ABD3]
The wilds inspire me, <i>misthios</i>. I find dangerous places and use them as the setting for my art. My latest work is based on a place where I was nearly killed.

Id: [0x0024ABD4]
Sounds like my kind of place.

Id: [0x0024ABD5]
Haha, I thought it might. There are rewards in danger.

Id: [0x0024ABE7]
Persians know peace?

Id: [0x0024ABE8]
Indeed. My people prospered after King Xerxes was murdered. All except for me. A man tried to kill me with poison, which is how I lost my sight. I fled and arrived here.

Id: [0x0024ABE9]
I find it hard to believe anyone would want you dead.

Id: [0x0024ABEA]
You're very kind. [beat - he's making a deal]Tell me another tale, then I'll tell you more of my past.

Id: [0x0024ABEB]
A killer of kings, hired to kill a simple blind man? Why?

Id: [0x0024ABEC]
I have your interest, do I? Tell another tale, and I will, too.

Id: [0x0024ABED]
Your brother! None of this is making any sense, old man.

Id: [0x0024ABEE]
I trust you, so I will tell you. My brother and I are the last living sons of King Xerxes.

Id: [0x0024ABEF]
Impossible. That would make you king.

Id: [0x0024ABF0]
I was. My name was Artaxerxes. I guided Persia through a time of peace. But my brother wanted the throne and plotted my death. Now, I hide here, exiled, living the life of a simple beggar. I will tell you more, but first -

Id: [0x0024ABF1]
Yes, yes. A tale for a tale.

Id: [0x0024ABF2]
Show me proof.

Id: [0x0024ABF3]
I <i>could</i>. You see, I knew a man named Themistokles.

Id: [0x0024ABF4]
The Athenian general. I heard stories about him being ostracized from Athens.

Id: [0x0024ABF5]
Over petty politics. He came to Persia, to me, looking for refuge. I was king, but only a boy. He spent his days learning Persian and telling me stories of his home. Places like the Akrokorinth[2406382], Mount Taygetos...

Id: [0x0024ABF6]
The places you wished you could see.

Id: [0x0024ABF7]
I loved the tales, and loved Themistokles like a father. He was kinder to me than Xerxes ever was. Tell me one last tale, and I'll tell you where he hid his treasure.

Id: [0x0024ABF8]
And what of your story?

Id: [0x0024ABF9]
I let the people believe Darius succeeded in killing me so I could escape.

Id: [0x0024ABFA]
Artaxerxes... There's something else you should know...

Id: [0x0024AC01]
My grandfather was Leonidas of Sparta.

Id: [0x0024AC02]
That means...

Id: [0x0024AC03]
Your father, King Xerxes, killed my grandfather.

Id: [0x0024AC04]
On second thought, never mind.

Id: [0x0024AC07]
Artaxerxes! False king. This <i>misthios</i> led me right to you. Time to finish what I started.

Id: [0x0024AC0C]
[cries weakly]No! No, no, no...

Id: [0x0024AC11]
You're safe! Thank Zeus.

Id: [0x0024AC1F]
Yes?

Id: [0x0024AC26]
Kings, murderers, Athenian generals, adventure... You tell a good tale, old man.

Id: [0x0024AC27]
After all that, you don't believe me?

Id: [0x0024AC28]
I think you're a great storyteller. It doesn't matter if any of it was true.

Id: [0x0024AC3F]
Kassandra, please.

Id: [0x0024AC44]
Stand behind me.

Id: [0x0024AC46]
Your father killed my grandfather. Now, I kill you.

Id: [0x0024AC48]
No! He's <i>mine</i>.

Id: [0x0024AC4E]
If this is my fate, then kill me.

Id: [0x0024AC50]
Stop him!

Id: [0x0024AC53]
I'll kill you both!

Id: [0x0024AC57]
I have traveled the Aegean to find him. I won't be stopped by a lowly mercenary.

Id: [0x0024AC5B]
I do sense some of Themistokles in you.

Id: [0x0024AC6D]
Find the tomb where Themistokles hid his treasure. I'm sure it will still be there.

Id: [0x0024AC71]
Despite being bound by honor to avenge Leonidas, you saved me. Thank you.

Id: [0x0024AC72]
After a life as a Persian king, you get used to people trying to kill you.

Id: [0x0024AC75]
Artaxerxes. Are you hurt?

Id: [0x0024AC76]
You call me by my name, despite accusing me of being a rambling old man. <i>Now</i> you believe me?

Id: [0x0024AC7D]
Hiyah!

Id: [0x0024AC7E]
I'll get you!

Id: [0x0024AC7F]
For Sparta!

Id: [0x0024AC82]
A papyrus. Says it was written by Themistokles, the Athenian general.

Id: [0x0024AC87]
This papyrus is so old... Could this be writing by Themistokles?

Id: [0x0024AC89]
I do now. That killer was Persian... Another one of your brother's hired executioners.

Id: [0x0024AC8A]
It was. If he doesn't return to Persia, my brother will send another. Then another. It's time this old man accepts his fate.

Id: [0x0024AC8E]
A note... written by Themistokles. Who knew the great general was also a poet?

Id: [0x0024ACA0]
What's it like, being a mercenary?

Id: [0x0024ACA1]
I do what I must to get by.

Id: [0x0024ACA2]
My brother said the same thing about being a man in Sparta. We learn to fight, to die for our family and our country... [beat]I can't wait!

Id: [0x0024ACA3]
You love your home, eh?

Id: [0x0024ACA4]
I do. We are strong and we are free! And any man would happily give his life for his city, his fellow soldiers, and his children.

Id: [0x0024ACA5]
So how many children do you have?

Id: [0x0024ACA6]
Uh, no, none... but when I'm older I'm going to marry Athena, and we'll have the strongest sons!

Id: [0x0024ACA7]
Well, then.

Id: [0x0024ACAD]
Do you know why a Spartan soldier can lose his helmet or spear without worry, but if he loses his shield, he is punished beyond all measure?

Id: [0x0024ACAE]
Tell me.

Id: [0x0024ACAF]
It is because a soldier needs his helmet and spear to defend only himself, but his shield is dearly important for the safety of his brothers and the whole battle line.

Id: [0x0024ACB6]
What of your brother?

Id: [0x0024ACB7]
Theoros? He's the best! He's amazing to watch in the games. He's fast and strong, and he can throw the javelin and discus farther than anyone.

Id: [0x0024ACB8]
Oh, yes?

Id: [0x0024ACB9]
I'm faster than anyone my age, but Theoros is like Herakles himself!

Id: [0x0024ACBA]
He sounds like a god made flesh.

Id: [0x0024ACBB]
He's my hero! He even sings like Orpheus! Do you want to hear me sing? Though mother says I sing like a harpy.

Id: [0x0024ACBC]
No, that's OK. I'll be glad to meet him.

Id: [0x0024ACC4]
Wouldn't it be faster to take a horse?

Id: [0x0024ACC5]
Hmm.

Id: [0x0024ACC6]
I want to own a legendary horse one day, like Helios's mighty stallions, Abraxas and Santana!

Id: [0x0024ACC7]
Don't be ridiculous.

Id: [0x0024ACCC]
You climb like a sure-footed goat! But, uh, I don't know if I can clamber up so quickly.

Id: [0x0024ACD1]
There's so much blood!

Id: [0x0024ACD2]
Life ends, hot and messy.

Id: [0x0024ACD7]
I didn't expect the sounds... or smells.

Id: [0x0024ACD8]
You learn to harden yourself during battle, so you can do what you have to. There's time enough for fear and worry afterwards.

Id: [0x0024ACDD]
This way, Kassandra! The <i>agoge</i> is up in the mountains. So we can train closer to Olympos!

Id: [0x0024ACED]
Gods be good, please untie me!

Id: [0x0024ACEF]
Have mercy! Cut me free!

Id: [0x0024ACF1]
Help me, before these murderers butcher me!

Id: [0x0024AD01]
Very well. When you're ready, meet me inside the tomb.

Id: [0x0024AD2E]
Word has already spread of you sinking those ships. There's a price on your head.

Id: [0x0024AD31]
[&scoff][sighs][/&scoff]That didn't take long.

Id: [0x0024AD7C]
Sure, you could give up. Or, you could sail home, kill your brother, and take back your kingdom.

Id: [0x0024AD7D]
Before that, you owe me. I saved your life. <i>And</i> I went on this adventure for you.

Id: [0x0024AD7E]
You are a brave man, Artaxerxes.

Id: [0x0024AD7F]
Don't know... But I'll find out.

Id: [0x0024AD83]
There's also word of Spartans landing on Mykonos.

Id: [0x0024AD86]
My play was a disaster, <i>misthios</i>! The actor was drunk, the <i>malákas</i>! He ruined it!

Id: [0x0024AD87]
What did he do?

Id: [0x0024AD88]
What didn't he do? Stumbling around, slurring the lines he didn't forget - he even spewed vomit on the front row! I was a fool to think an idiot goatherd could be an actor, but I'll have my revenge.

Id: [0x0024AD8A]
These cursed Spartans ruin everything! What about the City Dionysia? There will be no play performances if the Spartans don't give us some peace!

Id: [0x0024AD8B]
Is the war an inconvenience?

Id: [0x0024AD8C]
I want my writings to be heard, <i>misthios</i>. But that won't happen if the Spartan commander doesn't order his soldiers to stop.

Id: [0x0024AD8E]
My precious poem! But those words were to be buried with my cousin's body...

Id: [0x0024AD8F]
It wasn't buried when I found it.

Id: [0x0024AD90]
Cursed bandits have been robbing graves again! No doubt they've stolen his payment for Charon as well!

Id: [0x0024AD96]
Right behind you!

Id: [0x0024AD97]
Not this time. Go to Damalis and wait for me there.

Id: [0x0024AD98]
Aw, please?

Id: [0x0024AD99]
You've done enough for today. It could be dangerous. I'll come find you after.

Id: [0x0024AD9B]
I'm surrounded by fools, <i>misthios</i>. Fools that think comedies are of no importance!

Id: [0x0024AD9C]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0024AD9D]
A man laughed at me - he said that tragedies were the only true art. And his wife agreed - she said that no one would care about my play!

Id: [0x0024AD9F]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>. My poem is complete. All will love it at the festival. The gods themselves will delight in my wit!

Id: [0x0024ADA5]
Why are you telling me this?

Id: [0x0024ADA7]
Then go tell the gods and leave me in peace.

Id: [0x0024ADA9]
I hear one of my competitor's work is... rather good. I don't want his papyrus to reach the judge before mine.

Id: [0x0024ADAB]
Ah, <i>misthios</i>. I have the soul of a poet and yet not the means to produce my musings. It is a true tragedy, <i>misthios</i>, that I cannot write my <i>own</i> great tragedy!

Id: [0x0024ADAC]
What do you want?

Id: [0x0024ADAD]
A little papyrus, misthios. Or the means to buy some. Those good-for-nothing bandits have plenty of both.

Id: [0x0024ADAF]
The soldiers laugh at me. Their commander says my writing is a disgrace to Athens!

Id: [0x0024ADB0]
Why? Is your writing that bad?

Id: [0x0024ADB1]
It is not, but they think I shouldn't write at all! They say I should spend my time indoors, out of sight. Who are they to stifle me because I am a woman?

Id: [0x0024ADB2]
Some weaker men feel shamed by intellect.

Id: [0x0024ADB3]
My father made sure I was educated - he always encouraged my writing. If anyone brings shame to Athens, it's that commander and his cursed soldiers!

Id: [0x0024ADB8]
A place to bring Damalis... A prison? I should find out.

Id: [0x0024ADBA]
I have written a marvelous speech, <i>misthios</i>. It's for a politician - but the words are mine!

Id: [0x0024ADBB]
What does this have to do with me?

Id: [0x0024ADBC]
I must get his speech to him, but there are spies everywhere. His rivals want to know where his eloquence comes from.

Id: [0x0024ADBE]
Cursed bandits stole my papyrus! Do you have any idea how expensive it is, <i>misthios</i>? I can't afford more, and the guards do nothing about these <i>malákes</i>.

Id: [0x0024ADC0]
Some of Sparta's philosophers like to discuss my writings. There are not so many of us who follow Pythagoras's ways. I have new words of wisdom to send to them.

Id: [0x0024ADC1]
Philosophers don't have much else to do.

Id: [0x0024ADC2]
They're not the only ones who have taken an interest. Unfortunately, the commander doesn't like what I have to say. He thinks I interfere too much.

Id: [0x0024ADC4]
My brother takes credit for all my writing! He makes me send it to him. Everyone praises him for my work!

Id: [0x0024ADC5]
Siblings can be... difficult.

Id: [0x0024ADC6]
I could send him something bad to read. Then everyone would laugh at him! [beat]But is that enough? I can't take this, <i>misthios</i>! He's been doing this for years. I won't let it continue!

Id: [0x0024ADC8]
Dedication to poetry is to serve divine command. That is what I do each day, and I am blessed for it.

Id: [0x0024ADC9]
Why are you telling me? I'm not a poet.

Id: [0x0024ADCA]
But you too can serve the gods, <i>misthios</i>. These so-called Followers of Ares are an abomination! Their shrine is an affront to the divine.

Id: [0x0024ADCC]
My play... the whole audience was terribly afflicted. Everyone cried. I write too well for my own good.

Id: [0x0024ADCD]
You don't seem happy about that.

Id: [0x0024ADCE]
The play has been banned for causing too much suffering! The soldiers are keeping my draft in their camp. I wish it never existed. I've even been fined... I don't know how I'll pay.

Id: [0x0024ADD0]
Cursed bandits made off with all the drachmae for my play. How am I to pay for the scene decorations now?

Id: [0x0024ADD2]
My father thinks writing is not a respectable way to occupy my time. He's determined to marry me off to a boring merchant.

Id: [0x0024ADD3]
Better a boring merchant than a cruel one.

Id: [0x0024ADD4]
And better to be alone than to be unhappy, misthios. [beat]If something happened to that merchant... or, if he no longer had any means, my father would soon lose interest in the match.

Id: [0x0024ADD6]
<i>Misthios</i>, <i>misthios</i>... why must you make such a fuss... [beat]What else rhymes with <i>misthios</i>?

Id: [0x0024ADD7]
What are you rambling about?

Id: [0x0024ADD8]
My latest work! The tale of a simple <i>misthios</i>. I'll need coin to continue. [beat]Or, to pluck some from the thieves nearby who have plenty of drachmae...

Id: [0x0024ADDB]
I wrote a poem mocking the men, and most of them took it well. But one was too shamed by it.

Id: [0x0024ADDC]
Why? What did you say?

Id: [0x0024ADDD]
I simply did as all Spartan girls do... Mocking the misbehavior of the men is expected at festivals. It was meant as no more than a playful sting, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024ADDE]
Then why is he so upset?

Id: [0x0024ADDF]
Perhaps I went a little further than most. He was embarrassed by my ridicule of his small... spirit. I've been told he's on his way to do me harm.

Id: [0x0024AE5A]
So, does that bird follow you everywhere?

Id: [0x0024AE5B]
Ikaros? Yes, he likes to keep an eye on me. Are you jealous?

Id: [0x0024AE5C]
If you don't mind being watched, I don't either.

Id: [0x0024AE61]
Did Zeus give you any special powers? You know, Achilles got invulnerability, Herakles the strength of a god...

Id: [0x0024AE62]
If you know the old stories, you know what Zeus is especially good at.

Id: [0x0024AE63]
If you have that kind of talent, just call me Pandora.

Id: [0x0024AE72]
I don't trust that horse.

Id: [0x0024AE75]
I can't believe they fell for that.

Id: [0x0024AE78]
By Zeus, I can't believe I fell for that.

Id: [0x0024AE7B]
For Athens!

Id: [0x0024AE7E]
For [drunken burp]Sparta!

Id: [0x0024AEA1]
My partner and I were to perform at the temple - she reciting her epic while I accompanied with music.

Id: [0x0024AEA2]
Why are you not at the temple, then?

Id: [0x0024AEA3]
We have been accused of impiety by the temple priestess. The soldiers came for my partner this morning. I fear I am next!

Id: [0x0024AEA5]
The soldiers stationed near this village are actually quite well-behaved. They give their drachmae freely when they come to see me play, too.

Id: [0x0024AEA6]
You're lucky. Armed men camped nearby are generally not so well thought of.

Id: [0x0024AEA7]
Yes, but they're too nice lately. They gather their own grain and they have goats nearby. They almost never need to come into the village. We could use their business!

Id: [0x0024AEA9]
My husband is a soldier, a true Spartan. When he is home, I play the lyre softly while he tells me of his battles and strokes my hair.

Id: [0x0024AEAF]
Not all matches work out so well. You must be happy.

Id: [0x0024AEB1]
I'm not interested in your homelife, musician. Get to the point.

Id: [0x0024AEB3]
I want to send him a lock of my hair. But we are Spartan. He might like it better if I dedicated the death of an Athenian leader to him.

Id: [0x0024AEB4]
How sweet.

Id: [0x0024AEB5]
It is good to be in love, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024AEC2]
I have never been so insulted in my life. Those vermin! They profaned my holy songs dedicated to the gods.

Id: [0x0024AEC3]
Slow down. Who insulted you?

Id: [0x0024AEC4]
The military commander hired me to play for his soldiers. They sang along - the most vile things I've ever heard. Profaners! Scum!

Id: [0x0024AEC9]
You! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0024AECB]
The culture in Athens is the envy of the Greek world, of <i>all</i> the civilized people. Our musicians are unparalleled.

Id: [0x0024AECC]
And you're humble about it, too.

Id: [0x0024AECD]
My sister has gone to the villages to spread our culture, but now those uncouth Spartans are pressing that area. She'll be killed!

Id: [0x0024AECF]
Music is part of the sacred festivals in Athens, <i>misthios</i>. I am to play at the temple later - a great honor.

Id: [0x0024AED7]
Apollo must have blessed you with the gift of song.

Id: [0x0024AEDD]
The Fates have delivered you onto my path, and thus we travel together.

Id: [0x0024AEDE]
The Fates have been known to have a sense of humor.

Id: [0x0024AEDF]
Happening upon you, hero, is fortuitous.

Id: [0x0024AEE0]
Glad to hear it. So you dig through book roll?

Id: [0x0024AEE1]
No! Well, yes and no. I dig through dirt, too.

Id: [0x0024AEE2]
That's what farmers do.

Id: [0x0024AEE3]
I uncover our history. Sometimes... hopefully <i>this</i> time, it will uncover ancient wonders!

Id: [0x0024AEE4]
Hate to break it to you, but clay pots and dirt aren't that wondrous to most.

Id: [0x0024AEE5]
I've dedicated my life to it. It's so much more than treasure to be looted.

Id: [0x0024AEE6]
Is it though?

Id: [0x0024AEE7]
It's who we are! Knowing where we come from tells us where we are headed.

Id: [0x0024AEE8]
You educated people and your riddles.

Id: [0x0024AEE9]
Some people don't care about the past. They only want to steal something that will make them a few drachmae. Imagine that.

Id: [0x0024AEEA]
Hard to believe.

Id: [0x0024AEEB]
My peers are no more than treasure hunters and art dealers.

Id: [0x0024AEEC]
Well. You did mention precious jewels.

Id: [0x0024AEED]
These ruins and relics are notoriously hard to find. I found this one through clever searching and deduction.

Id: [0x0024AEEE]
Tell me more about it.

Id: [0x0024AEEF]
Mycenaeans held specific rituals. Some tales speak of objects made by the gods.

Id: [0x0024AEF0]
Yes. The gods like to play their hand on occasion.

Id: [0x0024AEF1]
Think of this, <i>misthios</i>! How would you like to have had the gods help you in battle?

Id: [0x0024AEF2]
A good warrior doesn't need any help from the gods or anyone else.

Id: [0x0024AEF3]
True. True. But think of what we might find there.

Id: [0x0024AEF4]
You think we'll find something with this power?

Id: [0x0024AEF5]
See? Now are you interested?

Id: [0x0024AEF6]
I certainly am.

Id: [0x0024AEF8]
Your training and practice have paid off.

Id: [0x0024AEFA]
Apollo must still be thanked for this glory. A goat sacrifice must be made, and I must send an offering to the priestess. And I must invite... I have to practice and... There isn't time!

Id: [0x0024AEFD]
I had been making good drachmae traveling to villages for the festivals. Well. Not good, but. Enough. Some.

Id: [0x0024AEFE]
"Had been" you say?

Id: [0x0024AEFF]
The bandits are so desperate they'll even rob a musician, it seems. Those poor bastards must be starving. I know I am.

Id: [0x0024AF04]
Uncultured fools. Swine. At least the Athenian soldiers behaved like humans.

Id: [0x0024AF05]
Your music wasn't popular with the Spartans?

Id: [0x0024AF06]
They spat on me. They threatened and leered. Told me to go back to the city and give birth to sons. May the crows take them and the commander who invited me to come play here.

Id: [0x0024AF0A]
Those bastard soldiers hired me to play at their revels. I played until my fingers bled but I never saw a single drachma. The next concert I play will be for their widows.

Id: [0x0024AF0C]
The priestess has barred me from playing my music at the temple. She says I live an impure life.

Id: [0x0024AF0D]
Oh? And what makes her say that?

Id: [0x0024AF0E]
I'm sure I don't know. But I have a... friend, a politician, who could help me if I got a message to him. Or I suppose we could deal with her directly. I'll show her impure.

Id: [0x0024AF10]
All my life I have practiced my music. I have played at concerts, at great parties, and gatherings, yet...

Id: [0x0024AF11]
You wanted to do something else?

Id: [0x0024AF12]
I want to play as a wandering musician - an <i>aoidoi</i>. But I am afraid to set off. If the roads were perhaps a little less wild, I should have courage. But the wolves and the bandits...

Id: [0x0024AF17]
Curse him and his stinking, leaky ship. That bastard merchant stranded me here.

Id: [0x0024AF18]
Let me guess. He asked for more drachmae once you were on the ship?

Id: [0x0024AF19]
Exactly. I've been surviving by playing music for the temple, but he should be made to pay before he tricks someone else.

Id: [0x0024AF1C]
A trait I learned from Themistokles. Now, as for you... I owe you payment.

Id: [0x0024AF1E]
I spent my entire life undoing my father's work. I won't end my life becoming him. As for you... there is the matter of your payment.

Id: [0x0024AF1F]
Well, I <i>did</i> save your life. And I went on an adventure for you... your highness.

Id: [0x0024AF21]
By Apollo! She has half the skill I have, why does she beguile men so completely?

Id: [0x0024AF22]
Who do you mean?

Id: [0x0024AF23]
My rival. A minor talent, but she is always hired to play at the temple for rituals and now for a private symposium. Drachmae from <i>my</i> pocket because they like her looks, if not her music.

Id: [0x0024AF24]
There will be other parties to play at.

Id: [0x0024AF25]
Yes, and they'll hire her for those, too. I will send her a bottle of wine to congratulate her. Poisoned. Or just a knife to her throat - I don't care. I won't hear her torture that lyre again.

Id: [0x0024AF2B]
You've only ever been a nuisance to us.

Id: [0x0024AF30]
When you die here, I'll take good care of your family. Don't worry.

Id: [0x0024AF35]
Ugh, I hate living here. No villager's going to be intimidated by a dripping wet bandit. Bet we couldn't even scare a lone child.

Id: [0x0024AF36]
They should be intimidated by your blade, not by the state of your clothes.

Id: [0x0024AF3B]
Almost tore my leg clean off!

Id: [0x0024AF3C]
It barely nipped you. Just a bit of skin.

Id: [0x0024AF3D]
Uh... Doesn't look good from where I'm standing.

Id: [0x0024AF3E]
Shh! Don't tell him that.

Id: [0x0024AF3F]
I'm gonna die!

Id: [0x0024AF40]
It's OK, you'll save money on sandals.

Id: [0x0024AF44]
Do you ever get worried that we'll be trapped in here by an earthquake?

Id: [0x0024AF45]
Piss off Poseidon recently?

Id: [0x0024AF46]
There's another way out, right?

Id: [0x0024AF48]
Ah, I am ruined! My whole life is that <i>kithara</i>. What am I to do without my instrument?

Id: [0x0024AF49]
What happened to it?

Id: [0x0024AF4A]
I was sitting in the shade playing when bandits fell upon me. If they had only killed me, it would be all right, but robbing me of my instrument! I am a silent nothing without it.

Id: [0x0024AF4C]
Making a living as a traveling musician is a difficult life. There is not much drachmae to be made. At least the travel used to be enjoyable.

Id: [0x0024AF4D]
"Used to be"?

Id: [0x0024AF4E]
The paths between the villages are wild now. Overrun with wolves and bandits.

Id: [0x0024AF50]
A man offered to watch my lyre for me while I set up for my performance. He ran off with it as soon as I turned my back.

Id: [0x0024AF56]
Nothing about your story surprises me. How could you fall for that?

Id: [0x0024AF58]
A thief and a betrayer. What a bastard.

Id: [0x0024AF5A]
I can trust you, though, right, <i>misthios</i>? You will help me, won't you?

Id: [0x0024AF5C]
Since the theft of our nation's chest, these streets are not safe. My lyre was stolen last night. It is old, of no value to anyone but a musician.

Id: [0x0024AF5D]
Did you see who stole it?

Id: [0x0024AF5E]
Yes, one of the thieves our guards do nothing about. Nothing is safe anymore.

Id: [0x0024AF66]
No! No! No more!

Id: [0x0024AF6C]
Don't take another step.

Id: [0x0024AF6E]
You're brave coming here. You want a whipping? The Monger would <i>love</i> to take you on.

Id: [0x0024AF6F]
He'd rot in the underworld for that.

Id: [0x0024AF70]
Whether they like it or not, any victim he likes gets his special treatment. [beat]I'll tell him you volunteer.

Id: [0x0024AF71]
You'll get <i>my</i> special treatment right now. I'll fucking kill you.

Id: [0x0024AF76]
Goddess of War and Wisdom. Does it please you, I wonder, to watch your city on the verge of battle?

Id: [0x0024AF79]
Did you? Athena made from pure gold, meeting a god on Taygetos, and how did you describe the Akrokorinth[2406380]? "Typical sanctuary <i>stuff</i>?"

Id: [0x0024AF7E]
<i>Maláka</i>. What is this?

Id: [0x0024AF81]
At least I'm still alive. For that, take this small token.

Id: [0x0024AF82]
You said you like stories. So... I gave you stories.

Id: [0x0024AF88]
Enough! We've gained ground on the backs of fallen Spartans.

Id: [0x0024AF8D]
I'll not have you men crying over them like <i>Antigone</i> over her dead brother.

Id: [0x0024AF91]
Prepare for battle, you cowering dogs! Seems you're not used to the smell of death.

Id: [0x0024AF99]
Run their ships ashore!

Id: [0x0024AF9E]
We'll not be outmaneuvered by the Athenians the way the Persians did to Leonidas.

Id: [0x0024AFA2]
Prepare for battle! Seems you cowering dogs are not yet used to the smell of death.

Id: [0x0024AFA7]
You! What's your reason for being here?

Id: [0x0024AFAB]
I'm talking to <i>you</i>! Present yourself!

Id: [0x0024AFBF]
A lock of hair. [sniffs]Smells familiar, somehow.

Id: [0x0024AFDB]
You did! And in your retelling, I felt like Themistokles was speaking through you. For your reward, go to the tomb in Salamis where Themistokles hid his treasure.

Id: [0x0024AFDE]
You did... Though much of what you said is not how I remember Themistokles telling it.

Id: [0x0024AFDF]
Things change.

Id: [0x0024AFE0]
Ah, we are proof of that, aren't we? Now, for Themistokles's treasure. Find the tomb in Salamis, where he made his triumphant stand against my father's navy. That's where your reward awaits.

Id: [0x0024B01C]
Prude. This is Korinthia! Anything goes in this sex <i>andron</i>. And the Monger <i>will</i> be satiated.

Id: [0x0024B01D]
You're as sick as he is, worm.

Id: [0x0024B03E]
I had no choice. That man wanted you dead... Must've been another one of your executioners.

Id: [0x0024B03F]
So, that was another one of your executioners.

Id: [0x0024B073]
It's all right. You had good intentions.

Id: [0x0024B074]
I thought I could sneak in... Like before.

Id: [0x0024B075]
Listen next time I tell you to do something.

Id: [0x0024B076]
OK.

Id: [0x0024B077]
I promise it's for your own good. This time, especially.

Id: [0x0024B078]
I'm glad you didn't. Especially with what I found there.

Id: [0x0024B080]
I just left the Monger's sex <i>andron</i>, if you can believe it. And it's where you were headed.

Id: [0x0024B081]
What happened to you?

Id: [0x0024B086]
This is it...

Id: [0x0024B088]
No.

Id: [0x0024B089]
It's true. Your client was being forced to take you there. [beat]And we found these.

Id: [0x0024B090]
What do I even say...

Id: [0x0024B097]
A camp of Spartan dogs is bringing nothing but destruction to these parts.

Id: [0x0024B09F]
Wild beasts have been ravaging these parts lately.

Id: [0x0024B0A7]
A camp of Athenians has been causing trouble.

Id: [0x0024B0AF]
A camp of bandits has been spotted in the area.

Id: [0x0024B0B7]
A group of huntresses are attacking people outside the city on sight.

Id: [0x0024B0BF]
A band of thieves is plaguing this area. Nothing is safe.

Id: [0x0024B0C7]
Pirates are making the waters unsafe for travelers.

Id: [0x0024B0CF]
Followers of Ares have been spotted nearby.

Id: [0x0024B0E1]
The tomb that Artaxerxes mentioned. It's real.

Id: [0x0024B0E5]
Themistokles's treasure. I've never seen anything like it.

Id: [0x0024B0E9]
Themistokles's treasure is in Salamis... I wonder what it could be.

Id: [0x0024B0EB]
Since taking control of the city, the Athenians will not allow women in the gymnasium. Are the women of Athens so soft that they never exercise?

Id: [0x0024B0EC]
Spartan and Athenian states are... different.

Id: [0x0024B0ED]
Well, the commander in charge of the gymnasium and his unit should be taught just how different it is here, I think.

Id: [0x0024B0EF]
I'm trying to train in these fields, and I keep stepping in goat shit.

Id: [0x0024B0F0]
Watch where you're running, then.

Id: [0x0024B0F1]
Ah, but some of the goat shit follows me around, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024B0F2]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x0024B0F3]
The farmer who tends to the goats in these fields. He is persistent. I am not interested, but he hounds me. Watches me train. Follows me home. He and his shitty goats can go to the crows.

Id: [0x0024B0F6]
Athletic competition is not just for the muscles, <i>misthios</i>. We dedicate our labors to the gods.

Id: [0x0024B0FC]
The gods take pleasure in competition. It is said they look favourably on athletes.

Id: [0x0024B0FE]
Skill, training, dedication. Gods don't enter into it.

Id: [0x0024B100]
I am devoted to my training and to the gods. But I need to sacrifice an animal and deliver an offering to the priestess at the temple, and I don't have time for both before I compete.

Id: [0x0024B102]
There is corruption in the athletic games. Dishonest athletes are accepting bribes, being intimidated by soldiers, hiring mercenaries...

Id: [0x0024B103]
Well, you appear to be trying to hire one yourself.

Id: [0x0024B104]
Only as a means of self protection! My rival has a mercenary working for her and is sending soldiers after me. I just want to even the playing field.

Id: [0x0024B108]
The man who has taken leadership of the nation since the defeat is Athenian by birth. He doesn't like the women training in athletics like the men. His soldiers chase us back into our houses.

Id: [0x0024B109]
Women don't train like men in Athens.

Id: [0x0024B10A]
Then someone should tell them they are not in Athens.

Id: [0x0024B112]
<i>Misthios</i>, my greatest rival has been accused of impurity by the priestess. The soldiers have already taken her into their custody.

Id: [0x0024B113]
Isn't that good for you?

Id: [0x0024B114]
No. I will not be robbed of my chance to humiliate her in the race.

Id: [0x0024B116]
In Sparta, men are encouraged to watch women exercise. It helps... promote the desire to create citizens.

Id: [0x0024B117]
Yes, I see. Or, rather, They see.

Id: [0x0024B118]
But today I have seen men who don't watch me exercise. They watch for where the women set down their possessions, and who has money. I think I am about to be robbed.

Id: [0x0024B11A]
I was running... And a lion chased me. [beat]I lost it, and ran into this cave to hide. Then a bear chased me out. There were more... Have you seen... Is the lion... [beat]<i>maláka</i>.

Id: [0x0024B11E]
When I train I feel like I could eat a bull by myself, like the heroes of old.

Id: [0x0024B11F]
Should we look for a bull, then?

Id: [0x0024B120]
Ha! Well, a goat will do. Or would, if they weren't being driven out of these fields by the wolves. I even saw a lion hunting here the other day.

Id: [0x0024B122]
I've seen you running, and jumping, and climbing. Misthios, you're amazing!

Id: [0x0024B128]
Who could look upon me and not be amazed?

Id: [0x0024B12A]
It's just practice, friend. I have trained hard to be able to do what I do.

Id: [0x0024B12C]
You're phenomenal. There is a place, a special place I go to train... Beautiful, but occasionally patrolled by dangerous bandits and raiders. A good spot. You would appreciate it.

Id: [0x0024B12E]
There were some soldiers watching me train a few days ago. Their hooting I could tolerate, but then their commander insulted my running form.

Id: [0x0024B12F]
What happened?

Id: [0x0024B130]
What happened? I challenged him, and he lost a footrace to a "girl," that's what happened. Now I am constantly being harassed by his unit. Some want to race, but others want me dead for shaming him.

Id: [0x0024B132]
The paths I run to train have become very dangerous. Wolves and bandits prowl everywhere.

Id: [0x0024B133]
You should run all the faster with a wolf or a sword at your back.

Id: [0x0024B134]
Yes, if I survive I'll win the games with ease. But perhaps you could make my training less lethal?

Id: [0x0024B136]
<i>Misthios</i>, have you heard of athletes replicating the labors of Herakles? You look as if you could complete a few yourself! Ever wrestled a lion?

Id: [0x0024B13C]
Ha, I could complete his labors before lunch. But then what would I do with the rest of my day?

Id: [0x0024B13E]
Let the poets concern themselves with these tales. I have my eyes set on real glories.

Id: [0x0024B140]
By the gods, <i>misthios</i>, you're inspiring. I believe you could kill a lion. Or a wolf. Or a bear! I believe you could kill all the beasts in the land! I'll hire you, if only to bask in your glory.

Id: [0x0024B142]
A politician, a bad gambler, he lost drachmae when I destroyed his pick to win the races.

Id: [0x0024B148]
He lost his drachmae, and you lost your humility in the same race?

Id: [0x0024B14B]
Ha, well run. That will teach him to place his drachmae with more care.

Id: [0x0024B14D]
Yes, but he hasn't learned from losing his bet. Now he's sending a mercenary after me. The slow fool hasn't caught me, of course, though he's not far. This must be dealt with.

Id: [0x0024B14F]
My father has... expectations. I am to win glory for the family. But there is another runner who I do not think I can beat.

Id: [0x0024B157]
While you worry about this, your rival is probably training. There's nothing to do but work harder and get better.

Id: [0x0024B159]
There are... different ways to achieve glory. We might find creative ways to overcome a rival.

Id: [0x0024B15B]
Her family is poor... I think her father would accept this bribe to withdraw her. Of course, there's always dealing with her directly. And I do mean "<i>dealing</i>" with.

Id: [0x0024B15D]
The ship that was bringing my new training supplies is down there somewhere. A brand new discus, finely forged javelins... all in a chest at the bottom of the ocean.

Id: [0x0024B15E]
So go get it. Swimming is good for your training.

Id: [0x0024B15F]
I throw, I don't swim. There are sharks. No problem for a <i>misthios</i>, perhaps, but for me they are a nightmare.

Id: [0x0024B161]
Is nothing safe from thieves in this city? Even the athletic equipment has been stolen.

Id: [0x0024B162]
What equipment? Most of the athletes I've seen barely wear clothes.

Id: [0x0024B163]
The javelins, <i>misthios</i>. Stop thinking about naked athletes and help us with these thieves!

Id: [0x0024B176]
Fine. [beat]I almost forgot. I got this sword for you from his house.

Id: [0x0024B178]
Wow. You're a good thief.

Id: [0x0024B1EB]
It's strange... I feel something. Towards the pyramid. It's covered in shards... Like Elpenor's.

Id: [0x0024B1F1]
These soldiers have some beautiful weapons, <i>misthios</i>. And that's not all! I know exactly where they keep their other valuables, too.

Id: [0x0024B1F3]
With so many bandits roaming these parts, the villagers have started hiding their valuables in caves.

Id: [0x0024B1F4]
Let me guess. You want to take advantage of that.

Id: [0x0024B1F5]
I know the exact caves, <i>misthios</i> - filled with wonders! But, I hear they're filled with bears, too.

Id: [0x0024B1F7]
I found a chest filled with riches, misthios. So much drachmae! And then cursed bandits took it from me.

Id: [0x0024B1F8]
You're saying bandits stole the drachmae you had already stolen?

Id: [0x0024B1F9]
Yes, but... [beat]I found it first! It should be mine. And I'd be generous with it, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024B1FB]
I know where a camp of thieves is hiding their loot. Enough for both of us, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024B201]
Stealing from thieves isn't really stealing, I suppose.

Id: [0x0024B202]
Exactly, <i>misthios.</i> If we work together, we could both get rich!

Id: [0x0024B204]
I can just take care of the thieves and keep all the loot for myself. Why would I bother cutting you in?

Id: [0x0024B205]
What? You dog! I won't let you!

Id: [0x0024B209]
Ancient ruins hold many secrets, <i>misthios</i>. More than rocks and rubble.

Id: [0x0024B20A]
You have an interest in the past?

Id: [0x0024B20B]
Ha! I have an interest in riches! I know where to find the most incredible bounty. But, bandits are usually swarming the ruins as well.

Id: [0x0024B20D]
I've found some fantastic valuables today, <i>misthios</i>. Real riches! I need to deliver them to my sister to sell at the market. But... bandits lie in wait for visitors to the city.

Id: [0x0024B213]
Followers of Ares leave offerings of armor and precious gems at their shrines.

Id: [0x0024B214]
And you'd like to get your hands on their loot.

Id: [0x0024B215]
Their riches are for the dark arts, <i>misthios</i>. Their shrines are evil! The gods will bless us for taking a stand against them.

Id: [0x0024B219]
A cursed <i>misthios</i> stole my loot! Wretched, good-for-nothing <i>malákes</i>, all of them! [beat]Well, not all of them. I'm sure you're not like that.

Id: [0x0024B21A]
You're sure, are you?

Id: [0x0024B21B]
Well, now's your chance to prove you're better! I'd normally go after the <i>malákas</i> myself, but there are bandits making trouble in the area. It's a lot to take on alone.

Id: [0x0024B21D]
Wretched soldiers keep harassing me. I can't go near their camp anymore.

Id: [0x0024B21E]
Are they harassing you? Or preventing you from looting?

Id: [0x0024B21F]
Ah, but they have so much, <i>misthios</i>! They have riches to offer the gods before battle. I can tell you exactly where to look.

Id: [0x0024B221]
There's a shark swimming nearby. I've never seen one so close to shore. Maybe the pirate boat drew it here.

Id: [0x0024B222]
Why are you telling me?

Id: [0x0024B223]
What's better than pirate loot, <i>misthios</i>? I heard they hide just off the coast. We can take it all! Though I'm a bit worried about the shark.

Id: [0x0024B225]
The forest, <i>misthios</i>, the forest! A pack of wolves is hiding precious secrets.

Id: [0x0024B226]
Wolves are hiding secrets?

Id: [0x0024B227]
The wolves guard riches, don't you see? They are spirit guardians for the Daughters of Artemis!

Id: [0x0024B22D]
You expect me to believe that? It sounds like a children's story.

Id: [0x0024B22F]
I enjoy unusual challenges.

Id: [0x0024B231]
Between the wolves and the huntresses, it will be tough to get to the riches. At least for someone like me.

Id: [0x0024B233]
There's a chest of precious items nearby. The soldiers plan to dedicate it to the gods! What a waste.

Id: [0x0024B234]
A waste? Why?

Id: [0x0024B235]
If the gods needed gold, then they would be down here with the rest of us.

Id: [0x0024B236]
And you've got no qualms about risking the anger of the gods to get this chest?

Id: [0x0024B237]
Shouldn't drachmae be the only god for a <i>misthios</i>? [beat]I can tell you where the chest is, but the soldiers guard it well.

Id: [0x0024B239]
You look brave, <i>misthios.</i> You look strong. You look ready for a challenge!

Id: [0x0024B23A]
What do you want?

Id: [0x0024B23B]
What do I want? What does anyone want, <i>misthios</i>? Gold! And I know where you can get some, too. I know where plenty is hidden. [beat]The lions get in the way, though.

Id: [0x0024B241]
One of the graveyard tombs was filled with riches, <i>misthios</i>! It can help the living.

Id: [0x0024B242]
You want to go grave robbing?

Id: [0x0024B243]
Not me. Looters already got to the tomb. They’re storing the riches just off the coast to be picked up by boat. I know exactly where you can look.

Id: [0x0024B245]
Riches await the brave, <i>misthios</i>! A chest of gold and silver... And gems! Countless gems!

Id: [0x0024B246]
Where's this chest?

Id: [0x0024B247]
That's the problem, <i>misthios.</i> It lies on the seabed. I'd go after it! But cursed sharks make it impossible.

Id: [0x0024B249]
I hear the workers have hidden a chest of valuables near their marble quarry. Feel like getting rich?

Id: [0x0024B24A]
Why don't you get it yourself?

Id: [0x0024B24B]
Well, there were bandits swarming the area earlier. They might have taken the chest for themselves.

Id: [0x0024B24D]
A rich man's remains were just buried, <i>misthios</i>. And his valuables were buried with him!

Id: [0x0024B24E]
That sounds like an easy steal for a scavenger.

Id: [0x0024B24F]
Indeed. Cursed looters got there before me. But, I know where they moved the riches, <i>misthios</i>. Too bad there are too many raiders for me to take on alone...

Id: [0x0024B251]
I'll take almost any job, and gods know I'll fight most men but... these Followers. I don't like the idea of them cursing me from their foul shrine. This contract may not be for me.

Id: [0x0024B253]
I came from the north to make money fighting as a mercenary soldier. To kill men. Not to clear out wolf dens and bear caves.

Id: [0x0024B259]
Why complain? Men die, and we make drachmae. Beasts die, and we make drachmae. It's all the same.

Id: [0x0024B25B]
Take heart, mercenary. At least, years from now, a bear's son will not slit your throat in your bed.

Id: [0x0024B25D]
If you want the task, then you are welcome to the pay. I crave battle, not butchery.

Id: [0x0024B25F]
I bought a sword and left home because I wanted to be a mercenary. An adventurer. Ha! [beat]Some adventurer.

Id: [0x0024B260]
Not as glamorous a life as you had imagined?

Id: [0x0024B261]
I wouldn't know. I live in that village there. I've barely left and I've twisted my ankle. I've fought no brigands, no beasts. A bit of uneven ground defeated me.

Id: [0x0024B262]
Ha, well, you will heal, and you can start again.

Id: [0x0024B263]
Perhaps not. I think it is an omen. There is a place I heard of, a dangerous place, but one with rewards for those brave enough to go. [beat]Not, I think, for me.

Id: [0x0024B265]
I have to admit, I'm not good at the sneaky side of the bounties. Give me something to fight, and I'm happy.

Id: [0x0024B266]
What do you mean by "sneaky side"?

Id: [0x0024B267]
There's a bounty on spies and deserters hiding in these woods. But they're <i>hiding</i>. I wish they'd just come out and fight me. I hate having to find them.

Id: [0x0024B269]
The Spartan commander said he has a full unit of strong soldiers and no use for mercenaries. Well. We can show him our use, can't we? They will need mercenaries if they take a few losses.

Id: [0x0024B26B]
The bandits... they killed so many in this village. I'm supposed to go after their leader, but... The throats they've already slit. So many.

Id: [0x0024B26C]
It's only death. The gods know I've sent my share to the underworld.

Id: [0x0024B26D]
What have you seen to be so hardened? Perhaps you are better for this task than I. The bandit chief and his men scare me. Death scares me.

Id: [0x0024B26F]
Corrupt leaders and their secret allies murdering their enemies by night. Performing dark rituals. No. Just no. Not interested.

Id: [0x0024B270]
What do you mean not interested? That sounds like a bounty to build a career on.

Id: [0x0024B271]
Pass. You want the job? I don't mind. Killing Followers of Ares and high profile statesman is not my idea of fun. I'll get the next one.

Id: [0x0024B273]
I've been hired to strike at the Spartans - to target their food supplies and the merchant ships they rely on.

Id: [0x0024B274]
Get to it, then.

Id: [0x0024B275]
Easy for you to say. Have you seen the way these Spartans fight? I know my limits. And angry, hungry Spartans are beyond my limits.

Id: [0x0024B277]
I have a problem... I may have stretched the truth a bit to secure a mercenary contract... It might be a bit bigger job than I'm used to, if I'm honest.

Id: [0x0024B278]
How <i>much</i> did you stretch the truth?

Id: [0x0024B279]
I told the Spartan commander I have sunk whole fleets of ships before. So he sent me after the pirates in the area... and the Athenians.

Id: [0x0024B27A]
You haven't ever sunk a ship, have you?

Id: [0x0024B27B]
I sank one, once. But it was mine. And I was in it.

Id: [0x0024B27D]
I accepted a fat bounty on a leader, but he's hired a mercenary of his own for protection. A real bastard, too. Not sure I can manage both of them myself.

Id: [0x0024B27F]
Stain the world with the blood of the beasts. Spill them open and redden this cursed world.

Id: [0x0024B280]
Whoa. You. Are you all right? What's happened?

Id: [0x0024B281]
I found my lover's body. Chewed. Partially eaten. I don't even know what type of beast it was... Wolves, bears, lions, it doesn't matter. I'll have vengeance on everything that crawls for her.

Id: [0x0024B283]
Ugh... still seasick. There's a pirate captain. Murderous bastard. I've been tracking him but... Ugh.

Id: [0x0024B284]
But you're not so good with boats?

Id: [0x0024B285]
One way to put it. I followed his ship to this harbor. Thought I might catch him while he's drinking on dry land but... Ugh.

Id: [0x0024B287]
With all the fighting going on, you'd think I'd have an easier time getting hired as a mercenary soldier.

Id: [0x0024B288]
Who are you looking to be hired by? Athens? Sparta?

Id: [0x0024B289]
Either. Both. I don't care so long as there is drachmae in it. Maybe if the armies take some losses, they'll be more interested in mercenaries...

Id: [0x0024B28B]
I've been on a contract with this Athenian unit for a while, but... I don't want to get tied down. I'm not looking for commitment right now.

Id: [0x0024B28C]
I... OK. How does this impact me?

Id: [0x0024B28D]
There's a Spartan unit I'm interested in. Nothing serious, just looks like fun work. But the commander here is jealous and possessive of his soldiers. Said he'd rather have me killed than let me go.

Id: [0x0024B2A7]
I've made a huge mistake, <i>misthios</i>. I wanted to go to war, to be a mercenary. Well, I finally saw battle. It was horrible.

Id: [0x0024B2AD]
Be strong, friend. It gets easier. The veterans sleep better than the recruits, I promise you.

Id: [0x0024B2AF]
Many fight, and see death, and die themselves. Show some courage if you want to be a mercenary.

Id: [0x0024B2B1]
I can't do it. I want to run, but the commander has the contract and my name. No one else knows me, though. If the commander lost that contract... Or his life...

Id: [0x0024B2B3]
Ah, someone who understands being a mercenary. It's not an easy life we lead, friend.

Id: [0x0024B2B9]
I've been a mercenary a long time, and I've got better things to do than listen to petty complaints.

Id: [0x0024B2BB]
No, it is not an easy life. But it is one worth struggling for.

Id: [0x0024B2BD]
You may be right. I'm near giving up my task... I'm here for the head of a Spartan commander, but his soldiers hound me, and I haven't been able to get near him.

Id: [0x0024B2BF]
I tracked a pirate and his lucky coin all over the Greek world. Finally, he came here and wrecked... and he and his coin went to the bottom of the sea.

Id: [0x0024B2C0]
It couldn't have been that lucky, then.

Id: [0x0024B2C1]
Still, I want that coin. I track, I kill, but I don't swim well enough to fight sharks. Perhaps in safer waters I could end this chase, but here...

Id: [0x0024B4B6]
He might anyway. Sounds like he needs answers.

Id: [0x0024B4B7]
I'll see what he has to say for himself.

Id: [0x0024B4B8]
If he's not lurking around here, he'll be at his house. [beat]I want this to end <i>today</i>.

Id: [0x0024B4BD]
"Acquiring contemporaneity." Acquiring a voice, that's what. I'm taking over your recordings. The humans have had enough of your pompous speeches.

Id: [0x0024B4BF]
You treat humans as useful apes. How many artifacts have you created to control their minds? Do you fear their potential that much?

Id: [0x0024B4C0]
Just look at what humans have achieved on their own! Democracy and diplomacy. A legacy of culture and art. We could share in this if you'd just treat them as equals.

Id: [0x0024B4C1]
Call me Aletheia. I am truth and its revelation, and I am calling you out. You Isu who try to rewrite the laws of the universe. You who manipulate human progress. What do you hope to achieve?

Id: [0x0024B4C2]
In your desperate seach for immortality, you've ignored the obvious. You run endless simulations to find one in which nothing changes. It's pointless.

Id: [0x0024B4C4]
I'm taking over your "retransmissions." You don’t speak for all of us anymore. I am as Isu as you, but I will no longer be part of your exploitation.

Id: [0x0024B4C5]
Change will come, and not just the so-called "end of the world" you fear. You call yourselves saviors. But tell me: Would this "doomsday" have appeared had you not pulled on the threads of the universe in the first place?

Id: [0x0024B558]
Ancient adventurer, I made this recording to try to help you. I'm sorry if it's confusing. We Isu see various pasts and futures, and I know you'll be here more than once.

Id: [0x0024B559]
I have no easy answers for you. Your future depends on a multitude of choices you have to make for yourself. I'm sorry if so many of them end in pain. Your playwrights' tragedies are your real oracle.

Id: [0x0024B55A]
But please, don't give up. You are more important than you can imagine. And like your own Pandora, I have one thing left to offer you: hope.

Id: [0x0024B55B]
Despair is not our only legacy. You're like me, a rebel against your destiny. You're not just a mercenary, you're a hero for the ages.

Id: [0x0024B55C]
My fellow Precursors set endless challenges in your path. Artifacts. Creatures. Don't get me started on the Olympos project. Their meddling got out of hand.

Id: [0x0024B55D]
Hold fast to what you know is true, and you will overcome.

Id: [0x0024B55E]
Claim your place in history. All that is terrible and beautiful in this world is your birthright. Take it.

Id: [0x0024B563]
Ancient scholar. You've stretched your life to the breaking point. I see you hiding yourself from the world, puzzling out the words of my fellow Precursors. Please, listen to my advice.

Id: [0x0024B564]
You're analyzing the equations of reality itself. You've gotten further than any other human has. That is both amazing and terrible.

Id: [0x0024B565]
It's clear to me that even this tiny dose of cosmic understanding has twisted your mind. I'm sorry. The Precursors never should have shared knowledge you weren't ready for.

Id: [0x0024B566]
The Precursors have manipulated you. They're turning your problem-solving intellect to their own selfish ends.

Id: [0x0024B567]
Please, scholar. Clear your mind and focus on your present situation. At this moment you possess a powerful artifact. It has extended your life long enough.

Id: [0x0024B568]
You live in obsessive darkness. You must understand that this focus on power and bloodlines is not your true legacy.

Id: [0x0024B569]
As hard as it may be, it's time to pass it on. It's someone else's turn to balance the equations.

Id: [0x0024B56E]
Traveler of many times. Congratulations on making it this far. I'm glad we can share this message out of time, this fragment of reality.

Id: [0x0024B56F]
Let's talk, rebel to rebel. We've been held back too long by Precursor rules. It's time for new paths with new possibilities. This is not an era of control, but of creation.

Id: [0x0024B570]
Or do you think you're really here now, listening to this recording? Isn't this an Animus re-creation? Isn't that part of a greater simulation? How far do the ripples in the pool spread?

Id: [0x0024B571]
I've gathered some like-minded Precursors to make a new start. We'll stop interfering and start enabling.

Id: [0x0024B572]
From your point of view, it will take a considerable amount of time to prepare. But when we're ready, you're welcome to join us.

Id: [0x0024B573]
I'm recording this just for you, even if those living in the past won't understand it. Our simulated realities will cross sooner or later.

Id: [0x0024B574]
After all, all you have to do is press a button and run another simulation.

Id: [0x0024B576]
Kassandra. Your little friend beat you back.

Id: [0x0024B578]
I was cheated, <i>misthios</i>! A little drachmae could help me get back on my feet. Or get revenge on the man who took most of mine.

Id: [0x0024B57E]
Did Leonidas know this place existed?

Id: [0x0024B584]
Well, Herodotos will be happy. It's clear someone was here far before we were.

Id: [0x0024B5CE]
Easy? Let's see if you can handle this!

Id: [0x0024B5D7]
Play nice, my students!

Id: [0x0024B5DB]
Don't hit too hard, the <i>misthios</i> might cry!

Id: [0x0024B75D]
Follow me. I know their secret exit. Up here!

Id: [0x0024B763]
If what Chrysis said was true, Myrrine believes my brother died long ago.

Id: [0x0024B768]
Siren Song. If I can find someone who knows the ship, I'll be one step closer to finding her.

Id: [0x0024B76A]
You're better than this. Make your own legacy. Let your mathematical discoveries be the glorious sunbeams that shine out past your tomb.

Id: [0x0024B76B]
A local captain and his <i>malákes</i> Dagger friends visit as often as they please, demanding made up taxes and beating my husband if he doesn't pay. [beat]Will you find him? Will you find my husband?

Id: [0x0024B771]
Oh, brother, what have they done to you?

Id: [0x0024B777]
Phoenix. There have to be people who know that name.

Id: [0x0024B784]
I should have enough information now. I should head back to Athens to see Aspasia.

Id: [0x0024B78A]
Yes! A <i>misthios</i>. Kill those masked <i>malákes</i>. Kill them good.

Id: [0x0024B78F]
We need to move fast. The Cult guards are on a rampage.

Id: [0x0024B790]
Ah, but I've sent some crew ahead to check on Neleus. They should bring him back to the ship so we can keep a closer eye on him.

Id: [0x0024B791]
This madness needs to stop.

Id: [0x0024B792]
But it will! We have the Eagle Bearer on our side.

Id: [0x0024B797]
It's the Cult.

Id: [0x0024B798]
They mean to keep us from Neleus.

Id: [0x0024B799]
Don't worry, Barnabas. We'll sink them.

Id: [0x0024B79A]
With you at the helm? Ah, yes, the Cult is doomed.

Id: [0x0024B7A4]
I'm going to wipe these Cult guards off of Lemnos once and for all.

Id: [0x0024B7A5]
It will be one more incredible stanza in the epic poem about your life.

Id: [0x0024B7A6]
And they have it coming.

Id: [0x0024B7B8]
What happened? Who did this?

Id: [0x0024B7C0]
Olympic champion Aietes! Yeah, that sounds perfect! I'll be the best the Greek world has ever seen.

Id: [0x0024B7CD]
Hey! This area is [belch]off limits!

Id: [0x0024B7D7]
Look, here comes that drunken, wait -

Id: [0x0024B7D8]
That's not Karpos! He's supposed to come alone.

Id: [0x0024B7D9]
Kill the interloper, then!

Id: [0x0024B7DF]
Hey! No one's allowed in here.

Id: [0x0024B7E5]
What in Hades was that?

Id: [0x0024B7E7]
Doesn't look like I'll find out through this door just yet. Maybe another time...

Id: [0x0024B7EB]
My husband usually waits on the road directly south of the cave[2106194] until it's clear.

Id: [0x0024B7F9]
Take what you think you've earned, just... leave enough for me and my wife.

Id: [0x0024B81B]
I crawled out of the fucking <i>ocean! I</i> was strong, but you? <i>You </i>were the one who died, little brother. [beat, softer]No, <i>I </i>had no one.

Id: [0x0024BAAC]
There's the rebel hideout[2315766].

Id: [0x0024BAB1]
That must be one of the camps.

Id: [0x0024BAB6]
I'm coming for you, Podarkes.

Id: [0x0024BAC1]
There's the doll.

Id: [0x0024BACA]
The temple's coming along, Evandros.

Id: [0x0024BACB]
It'll stay in ruins if we don't secure more donations. Soldiers can't get <i>all </i>the funds.

Id: [0x0024BACC]
They can if you don't want the temple destroyed by our enemy. [beat]But I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x0024BACE]
It's a good deed, restarting construction. Lygdamis was a great man who deserves reverence.

Id: [0x0024BACF]
His battles against corruption and oligarchy are lessons we all should remember. I do intend to finish the temple.

Id: [0x0024BAD0]
Thank you, Phoenix.

Id: [0x0024BAD6]
Your general acted quickly - raising the alarm.

Id: [0x0024BAD7]
Timo knows Paros is a threat. They make their business clear.

Id: [0x0024BAD8]
They can't be more clear than sending soldiers. [beat]There's no treaty?

Id: [0x0024BAD9]
Maybe there was, but it's <i>long</i> over. Now there's no mistaking them for anything but the enemy.

Id: [0x0024BADA]
An enemy I could help you defeat.

Id: [0x0024BADB]
We'll discuss that later. [beat]But I think you're right.

Id: [0x0024BAE1]
[&breath]The island is beautiful.

Id: [0x0024BAE2]
It is. Sparta has nothing on Naxian beaches.

Id: [0x0024BAE4]
[&scoff]Sparta. All I remember is the bottom of Mount Taygetos.

Id: [0x0024BAE6]
When I brought you to the Pythia as a baby, she never said we would live a nightmare. She said you had such <i>promise.</i>

Id: [0x0024BAE7]
The Pythia can't predict everything.

Id: [0x0024BAED]
There's a great view up ahead. We'll leave our horses here.

Id: [0x0024BB07]
The rebel is there.

Id: [0x0024BB0D]
The nation's treasure, ripe for the picking.

Id: [0x0024BB14]
If he sees what I see in you, I think he'll have much to be excited about.

Id: [0x0024BB23]
So we all know the ancient Greeks wrote about what would later be called mythical beings. But in this reality, some of them are more than mythical.

Id: [0x0024BB3F]
This recording was supposed to be about the Spear of Leonidas. But you know what a spear is. Humans have been killing each other with them for over a hundred thousand years.

Id: [0x0024BB46]
I shouldn’t be surprised. My fellow Precursors love being treated like gods. Why not create pets worthy of that reputation?

Id: [0x0024BB4D]
I'm afraid Precursor interference is behind this. A corruption in biological programming. Technological artifacts merging with flesh to create monstrous hybrids.

Id: [0x0024BB54]
And here you were supposed to listen and be impressed by this Precursor monument around you. They wanted to make sure you remembered this island no matter how often it was renamed. Thera. Kallista. Atlantis.

Id: [0x0024BB5B]
It took Precursor ambition to make such simple concepts into artifacts powerful enough to threaten two entire civilizations. Bravo us.

Id: [0x0024BB62]
And the staff you call the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus? It's essentially a staff like any other. It's a support, a potential weapon, and a symbol of power.

Id: [0x0024BB6B]
Precursor sites have often included an educational mandate aimed at humans. I’m sure you already realize these "generous" revelations are strategic.

Id: [0x0024BB72]
It was supposed to be a reference point for simulating new universes. But how can they make a better future if they won't acknowledge their past mistakes?

Id: [0x0024BB79]
The Precursors were proud of this monstrosity. They wanted it to be an indestructible repository of their knowledge.

Id: [0x0024BB88]
Too many of my people have tried to manipulate humans to their own ends. I'm sorry some of them have been so successful.

Id: [0x0024BB8F]
At least one of the worst influences is gone in my present, anyway. Juno's power was immense. I never would have been able to transmit these recordings if she was still here.

Id: [0x0024BBD5]
I'll need much more information to identify who these Cultists are.

Id: [0x0024BBEE]
Prexileos... No! Wake up, wake up! You can't leave us alone.

Id: [0x0024BBF3]
No! Idyia, my love. No! Wake up! Come on, wake up! Wake up...

Id: [0x0024BBF8]
Are you OK, Prexileos? How badly did they hurt you?!

Id: [0x0024BBF9]
I'm fine, my love. Are you -

Id: [0x0024BBFA]
Don't you worry about me when you're bleeding all over.

Id: [0x0024BC03]
There! Kill the meddling<i> misthios </i>and these lovebirds.

Id: [0x0024BC09]
What happened?

Id: [0x0024BC0E]
Idyia? Prexileos?

Id: [0x0024BC13]
[cries weakly]No! No, no, no...

Id: [0x0024BC18]
You're safe! Thank Zeus.

Id: [0x0024BC89]
I told you! There's tons of drachmae to be made digging caves!

Id: [0x0024BC8F]
<i>Misthios</i>! Over here, quick!

Id: [0x0024BC96]
Where to now, Eagle Bearer?

Id: [0x0024BC97]
Smuggler's Dock on Skyros. We need to meet the Magistrate.

Id: [0x0024BC98]
Skyros it is!

Id: [0x0024BC9E]
There it is, Smuggler's Dock. Bring it in easy.

Id: [0x0024BCA3]
<i>Misthios!</i> The Dagger know we're here! We need to move fast!

Id: [0x0024BCA9]
That boat, it's...

Id: [0x0024BCAB]
...It's preparing to attack! Get ready for a fight!

Id: [0x0024BCB2]
That's no pirate ship... It's the<i> Cult!</i>

Id: [0x0024BCB4]
Battle stations!

Id: [0x0024BCB5]
They're coming from Skyros. Of course the <i>malákas </i>Cult's involved with the Dagger...

Id: [0x0024BCF1]
Then you're bound by blood to avenge him...

Id: [0x0024BCFC]
You look like you're ready to go.

Id: [0x0024BCFE]
Sure you don't want to reconsider?

Id: [0x0024BD04]
Securing Kythera can wait.

Id: [0x0024BD05]
Good, because -

Id: [0x0024BD06]
By the F-f-<i>fates!</i>

Id: [0x0024BD09]
The High Priestess could be in grave danger. We don't have time for this.

Id: [0x0024BD0A]
Your loss. Fine, I'll fetch the scout and have them give us their report.

Id: [0x0024BD0C]
Diona said something about the scouts and their report. Where are they?

Id: [0x0024BD0E]
Maláka.

Id: [0x0024BD10]
Did she leave already?

Id: [0x0024BD11]
Yes, quite awhile ago in fact.

Id: [0x0024BD1B]
This must be the amulet the naked man was going on about. [surprised]Looks expensive.

Id: [0x0024BD20]
This amulet will work perfectly. My love will look beautiful in this.

Id: [0x0024BD24]
I think I might just have what you’re looking for.

Id: [0x0024BD25]
There’s no way you could have -

Id: [0x0024BD32]
Spare some drachmae?

Id: [0x0024BD34]
Relax, relax. The name's Demokritos. Renowned thinker of thoughts, writer of writes, questioner of answers.

Id: [0x0024BD35]
I'm... Kassandra. [beat]And I've never heard of you.

Id: [0x0024BD36]
Probably says more about you than me, Kassandra. [&laughs]Now, you came here to help, hmm? So happens, I've uncovered the whereabouts of three divine mathematical discoveries.

Id: [0x0024BD37]
<i>Chaire</i>, Demokritos.

Id: [0x0024BD38]
Mathematical discoveries. Really?

Id: [0x0024BD3A]
Yes, <i>really</i>. The theorems, when combined with my own, will unlock the greatest mystery in the universe - which, as you know, is a place where mysteries strive to remain locked.

Id: [0x0024BD3B]
Come back as soon as you have one.

Id: [0x0024BD3C]
As soon as you've seen one location, please return.

Id: [0x0024BD6C]
The tortoise arrives at a point. Achilles, who is chasing it, runs after him. But after Achilles arrives at the same point, the tortoise has moved on. By the time Achilles arrives at the tortoise's new spot, the creature has again moved further.

Id: [0x0024BD6D]
[&laughs]Exactly! It shows how the universe divides itself infinitely.

Id: [0x0024BD6E]
A mathematical theory hidden in a child's fable.

Id: [0x0024BD6F]
Zeno was clever - every knowledgeable old man I've ever met was an idiot. [&laughs]But the minds of children are endlessly wise.

Id: [0x0024BD70]
It's just some silly riddle.

Id: [0x0024BD71]
What? [&laughs]No! The tortoise arrives at a point. Achilles, who is chasing it, runs after him.

Id: [0x0024BD72]
At first, I didn't think I saw anything special about it. But the sides of this diagram aren't even. The side marked <i>a</i> is almost half of the side marked <i>b</i>.

Id: [0x0024BD73]
Almost, but not quite[&laughs] - a and b are to a, as a is to b.

Id: [0x0024BD74]
If you say so. It's just a rectangle to me.

Id: [0x0024BD75]
[&scoff]Open your eyes. That "rectangle" is two shapes - a rectangle, yes, but also a square. The length of sides a and b is to the length of the side a, as a is to b.

Id: [0x0024BD76]
So, how can this theory be used?

Id: [0x0024BD77]
Used! [&laughs]It isn't used, only observed. It is the divine balance, occurring naturally in the most measurably beautiful places in the world. It is everywhere [beat]and nowhere.

Id: [0x0024BD78]
Why? Did Pythagoras invent the triangle?

Id: [0x0024BD79]
[&scoff]Great minds don't invent - they discover. Pythagoras discovered that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides!

Id: [0x0024BD7A]
I thought it might be about the points of the triangle, but the theorem is about the length of the sides.

Id: [0x0024BD7B]
Astute! [&laughs]You're wiser than you put on. The two shorter sides squared, when added together, are equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

Id: [0x0024BD85]
You did. And with this, I can finally form my grand theory - the theory that simultaneously divides and unites all the universe.

Id: [0x0024BD86]
All of this sounds... ambitious.

Id: [0x0024BD87]
One can't achieve greatness by attempting mediocrity. [&laughs]But I confess, I have a personal motivation.

Id: [0x0024BD8E]
Everyone always does.

Id: [0x0024BD8F]
Ha! In another life, you would've made a fine student.

Id: [0x0024BD90]
You missed your chance to tell her once, Demokritos. There's no point in missing it again. Let's go.

Id: [0x0024BD91]
What? [&laughs]Right now?

Id: [0x0024BD96]
Demokritos... I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0024BD97]
They killed her. For it to end like this... after all this time.

Id: [0x0024BD9D]
It's never too late.

Id: [0x0024BD9F]
Someone's going to find us here and think we did this. Demokritos... we have to go.

Id: [0x0024BDA0]
I... I left once before, I won't leave again.

Id: [0x0024BDA2]
You have your theorem, and the others... read them to her. Let her see your poetry.

Id: [0x0024BDA3]
It's too late.

Id: [0x0024BDA4]
Demokritos, please.

Id: [0x0024BDA5]
You can go. [beat]In another life... she might've known my love for her. You might have been my student. Imagine the happiness we'd have known.

Id: [0x0024BDA6]
A wise man told me, "The richest person in any land is the one who wants for the least." Don't want for the past, Demokritos.

Id: [0x0024BDA7]
I'll leave soon enough. But for now, I think I want for privacy. Take this, and leave me to mourn, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0024BDB0]
I can blame fate, but I shouldn't have waited so long.

Id: [0x0024BDD7]
His spies are everywhere.

Id: [0x0024BDD9]
We are all that's left of the resistance.

Id: [0x0024BDDB]
This is the first night we aren't fighting for our lives, and it could be our last.

Id: [0x0024BDDF]
Podarkes and his men have been hunting and killing us without mercy.

Id: [0x0024BE21]
Someone mentioned you could use some protection.

Id: [0x0024BE22]
I was hired to keep you safe.

Id: [0x0024BE23]
I'm here to look after you.

Id: [0x0024BE2B]
Oh, thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Take this for your trouble.

Id: [0x0024BE2C]
Thanks! Here, for your efforts, mercenary.

Id: [0x0024BE2D]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Please, take this.

Id: [0x0024BE2E]
By Zeus, you're just in time. Your spear is sorely needed.

Id: [0x0024BE2F]
Surely the gods sent you. My enemies are close.

Id: [0x0024BE30]
Thank the gods! I hear them coming.

Id: [0x0024BE63]
A delivery for you.

Id: [0x0024BE64]
This is for you.

Id: [0x0024BE65]
Someone thought you might need this.

Id: [0x0024BE6C]
Oh, thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Take this for your trouble.

Id: [0x0024BE6E]
Thanks! Here, for your efforts, mercenary.

Id: [0x0024BE70]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. Please, take this.

Id: [0x0024BE73]
By Zeus, you're just in time. Your sword is sorely needed.

Id: [0x0024BE76]
Surely, the gods sent you. My enemies are close.

Id: [0x0024BE79]
Thank the gods! I hear them coming.

Id: [0x0024BE91]
This must be a part of Theseus's armor. Fancy.

Id: [0x0024BE95]
Looks like a piece of Theseus's armor.

Id: [0x0024BE99]
I wonder how many more pieces of Theseus's armor are there...

Id: [0x0024BEA4]
See for yourself.

Id: [0x0024BEAE]
As the gods would have it, I've already killed that corrupt nation leader. <LF>

Id: [0x0024BEAF]
Good. That malákas deserved to die. Take this drachmae as thanks. 
<LF>

Id: [0x0024BEB7]
<i>I can't.</i>

Id: [0x0024BEBE]
Diona is done with you.

Id: [0x0024BEE3]
I'm Kassandra. And you?

Id: [0x0024BEE4]
I'm the Messenger of Zeus. But you can call me Kassandra. And you are?

Id: [0x0024BEF0]
So, there's a price on your head? Now I'm interested.

Id: [0x0024BEF6]
There was, though there isn't anymore. [beat]Now then, tell me another tale, and I'll tell you more of my past.

Id: [0x0024BF02]
Oh, thank you, misthios. Take this for your trouble.

Id: [0x0024BF04]
What a nice intention.

Id: [0x0024BF06]
What? Let me see this.

Id: [0x0024BF09]
By Zeus, you're just in time. Your sword is sorely needed.

Id: [0x0024BF0C]
Surely, the gods sent you. My enemies are close.

Id: [0x0024BF0F]
Thanks the gods! I hear them coming.

Id: [0x0024BF19]
Hmm. I need a boat. I should go see the shipbuilder.

Id: [0x0024BF39]
Just wait a while longer, and then we'll go together.

Id: [0x0024BF3B]
You have to tell your long lost love how you feel. Let's go.

Id: [0x0024BF41]
Demokritos. Are you ready to confess your love?

Id: [0x0024BF42]
I can't believe I'm doing this...

Id: [0x0024BF44]
You're right. This time, I will do it properly.

Id: [0x0024BF51]
I'm going to miss the London loft. I really liked the view.

Id: [0x0024BF52]
Of course. After clearing out the last of our gear, I observed the infiltration from a distance.

Id: [0x0024BF53]
Did they pick up the present I left?

Id: [0x0024BF54]
No one at Abstergo will be stupid enough to stick that in a computer.

Id: [0x0024BF55]
Miss it? Why can't you go back?

Id: [0x0024BF56]
Yes, they found the USB key you "dropped" under the desk. Nice tactic.

Id: [0x0024BF58]
Impressive.

Id: [0x0024BF59]
All in a day's hack.

Id: [0x0024BF74]
Didn't you read Kiyoshi's report? Abstergo's already swept through it. It's compromised.

Id: [0x0024BF75]
No, I've been busy researching Thera... Kiyoshi, are you all right?

Id: [0x0024BF76]
They don't have to. It's a shell holding one of my special RFID transmitters. Get it anywhere near a workstation, like, say, in the head of security's office, and... Boom.

Id: [0x0024BFE7]
You're right. But these waters are teeming with Athenians, pirates, and sharks. The soldiers need to be shown how to rule these waters... Like <i>Spartans</i>.

Id: [0x0024C00E]
We cannot openly attack the peasants. We need the farmers here too much, but an example must be made.

Id: [0x0024C05B]
The statue. It's gone.

Id: [0x0024C05E]
Those who came before... They speak to us and show us revelations! Though these words of disapproval are troubling.

Id: [0x0024C05F]
The gods have argued before. Athena and Poseidon competed for Athens. I wonder if Aletheia won control of this place.

Id: [0x0024C063]
He won't rest until all who oppose him are dead.

Id: [0x0024C06D]
[sighs]This is going to be a long rebellion.

Id: [0x0024C074]
Her words are for you, Eagle Bearer! My preparations bear fruit. The potential of your bloodline is proven by the Precursors themselves!

Id: [0x0024C075]
Aletheia says she can see the future... Many futures. Can this be a true oracle?

Id: [0x0024C078]
No, no. Lies! This is not obsession, this is research! This is discovery of the very origins of the world!

Id: [0x0024C079]
It is... an opinion, Pythagoras. Though one with reason behind it, I believe.

Id: [0x0024C07B]
This is madness. Fiction. Where I thought there would be wisdom, there is only the garbled babbling of a fool.

Id: [0x0024C07C]
Pythagoras, calm yourself. Maybe this invitation was meant for someone else. There's no need to lose your reason over mere words.

Id: [0x0024C082]
Nothing else to find here. I need to speak with that strange woman.

Id: [0x0024C087]
Now the <i>misthios</i> knows who she works for. The rebels should know too.

Id: [0x0024C0C6]
The Lost Book of Herodotos. The Spear of Leonidas. If I didn't work for the Assassins, I wouldn't believe it. I'm still not sure I believe it. But a little luck and a lot of research later, and we've got ourselves the archaeological find of the century. At least, we would if I could publish it.

Id: [0x0024C0CE]
"The Assassins who found Atlantis." Sounds like the title of a documentary full of cheap CGI and alien theories. Alannah tells me that Troy was considered a myth, before Frank Calvert found it and Heinrich Schliemann stole credit for it. If we ever get to reveal this, I wonder who we'll give the credit to?

Id: [0x0024C0D3]
Could Kyra have known all along?

Id: [0x0024C0D8]
Just when I think I've got a handle on the Precursors, someone new shows up. At least Aletheia seems to be no friend to Juno. I still can't believe I wasn't on the team that took her down. I could have stopped... [sigh]Victoria's right, blaming myself is useless. But <i>tozz feek</i>[screw you], Otso Berg. You're going to pay for betraying Charlotte. One artery at a time.

Id: [0x0024C0DD]
Mission accomplished. So why does it feel like this is just the beginning? Isu infighting, a relic that grants immortality, myths proven to be true... Slow down Layla, one miracle at a time. Congratulate the team. Keep the staff safe. And figure out how you're supposed to balance out the universe. That's all.

Id: [0x0024C0E4]
Hello Miss Hassan. Nice trick with the fake USB key. Almost inconvenienced Abstergo headquarters. Your pranks are amusing as always.

Id: [0x0024C0E7]
Let me be direct. I know you and the Assassins are searching for something of great importance. Transmit your findings, or your present colleagues will become collateral damage.

Id: [0x0024C0EB]
Last night, a burglary took place at the Notre-Dame de Quebec Cathedral-Basilica. Fortunately the damage to this historical building is minimal. The parish secretariat reports that the criminals left without the items they meant to steal.

Id: [0x0024C0F1]
Or perhaps I should start with an old friend from Abstergo, <i>habibti</i>. Berg, out.

Id: [0x0024C0F2]
The rebels deserve the truth as well. But blood is everything to some people. They could abandon her if they knew Podarkes was her father.

Id: [0x0024C0FE]
Save some Athenians for me, <i>misthios</i>!

Id: [0x0024C103]
For glory! For Sparta!

Id: [0x0024C107]
Bruised, bloody, or broken! Never hold back!

Id: [0x0024C11E]
Ah, the misthios returns! I wonder, did she have a change of heart regarding our doomed rebel?

Id: [0x0024C120]
<i>Chaire.</i>

Id: [0x0024C124]
[&laughs]Don't exactly blend in, do you?

Id: [0x0024C135]
You need me to deal with him.

Id: [0x0024C13A]
So you want me to deal with her.

Id: [0x0024C1A1]
<i>Misthios</i>! I have message for you.

Id: [0x0024C1A3]
And you just had to kill him, didn't you?

Id: [0x0024C1BA]
Bring these three theorems to me, and I will reward you handsomely.

Id: [0x0024C1D5]
But after Achilles arrives at the same point, the tortoise has moved on. By the time Achilles arrives at the tortoise's new spot, the creature has again moved further.

Id: [0x0024C1D6]
It shows how the universe divides itself infinitely.

Id: [0x0024C1DA]
The same way you didn't have a choice about giving me <i>pater's</i> doll in front of my men? My family?

Id: [0x0024C1DB]
They deserved the truth.

Id: [0x0024C1DC]
You broke my heart. You killed my… [beat]Podarkes, and now you killed Thaletas. The sooner you leave Mykonos the better.

Id: [0x0024C1DD]
Kyra, I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0024C1DE]
So am I, <i>misthios</i>. So am I.

Id: [0x0024C1E0]
I sent out two notes, and who responds? Thaletas the Spartan, and Kassandra the Eagle Bearer. I never imagined you'd both bring me so much sorrow.

Id: [0x0024C1E5]
[beat]When <i>I</i> was a student, I loved a poet. But I was so consumed by study I never told her. I hope to use these theorems to show her <i>my</i> poetry. And, maybe, to win her heart.

Id: [0x0024C1EE]
A tablet. This writing looks like instructions. I wonder what it could be used for?

Id: [0x0024C1F0]
It will be near where he made his triumphant stand against my father's navy.

Id: [0x0024C1F4]
The tablet should allow me to open the door.

Id: [0x0024C1F6]
YOUNG KASSANDRA

Id: [0x0024C1F8]
They deserved the truth.

Id: [0x0024C1F9]
Yes, and I'm glad they know. The truth brought us closer together.

Id: [0x0024C1FA]
They've even fallen for you, as I have. And they are celebrating us.

Id: [0x0024C205]
Scouts came back from Delos. The <i>misthios</i> likes to set fires.

Id: [0x0024C206]
She just might be the answer to our prayers.

Id: [0x0024C207]
She's only mortal.

Id: [0x0024C208]
From what I've heard, she's much more.

Id: [0x0024C22A]
These pieces fit together perfectly. This must be the key.

Id: [0x0024C22C]
By the gods! The statue came alive!

Id: [0x0024C22D]
I am no statue, child. If you cannot comprehend what stands before you, how are you to entertain me?

Id: [0x0024C231]
I should get out of this diving suit before I start exploring.

Id: [0x0024C2C8]
Have these waters ever seen a more handsome man than Barnabas?

Id: [0x0024C2CD]
I lost everything on Delos. But thanks to you, I have a family again.

Id: [0x0024C2D9]
You've given me a new purpose. Thank you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024C2DD]
Welcome back! There's a message for you on the board. Came from the Delos Islands.

Id: [0x0024C2DE]
One of the Cultists is there, Kassandra. His name is Podarkes.

Id: [0x0024C2DF]
You reading my messages, Barnabas?

Id: [0x0024C2E0]
I may have taken a peek.

Id: [0x0024C38B]
Forge activated. Synchronizing retransmission chronicity... Contact engaged.

Id: [0x0024C4DB]
There are many secrets in this world that are hidden behind myth and legend.

Id: [0x0024C4DC]
And who are you?

Id: [0x0024C4DD]
Pythagoras? That doesn't make any sense. He died decades ago.

Id: [0x0024C4DE]
Yes, almost a century if memory serves. And yet, here I am standing before you.

Id: [0x0024C6BA]
Ah <i>misthios</i>! You really should go for a swim in the Sacred Lake on Delos Island.

Id: [0x0024C6F2]
What are you trying to say, Barnabas?

Id: [0x0024C6F3]
Oh nothing, nothing. I just worry the Delians will see you covered head to toe in blood and get the wrong idea.

Id: [0x0024C6F7]
I never would've guessed you were a lover.

Id: [0x0024C6F8]
Well, I wasn't. My theory - that all atoms exist with a great void between them - is a bit like the life I've lived.

Id: [0x0024C6F9]
But not anymore. Now you're filling that void.

Id: [0x0024C6FA]
Maybe... maybe what fills the void, and what draws us together, is love.

Id: [0x0024C6FB]
Save that line for the poet, Demokritos. It's a good one.

Id: [0x0024C6FC]
You think so? All right, I will!

Id: [0x0024C702]
No! That's her! Those bandits... Stop them!

Id: [0x0024C707]
Spare some drachmae?

Id: [0x0024C884]
Then why do the Cult's bidding?

Id: [0x0024C885]
Have you been paying attention? They're following <i>my </i>lead.

Id: [0x0024C886]
Then make a choice on your own. Help find our <i>mater</i>.

Id: [0x0024C889]
They'll have their work cut out for them.

Id: [0x0024C88A]
I doubt it. The "family" will be exterminated.

Id: [0x0024C88B]
But they'll see how wrong they are.

Id: [0x0024CBB0]
DURIS

Id: [0x0024CC19]
Pausanias gave you a task. Spartan Kings aren't known for their patience.

Id: [0x0024CDA5]
But she said we should celebrate without her.

Id: [0x0024CDA9]
Even if we can't be together, I will sail home to Sparta with you in my heart.

Id: [0x0024CDAA]
And before I go, I should say goodbye to Kyra.

Id: [0x0024CDAC]
I'd rather drink alone.

Id: [0x0024CDAD]
Leave me, Kassandra.

Id: [0x0024CDAE]
I'd rather drink alone.

Id: [0x0024CDB3]
But, let's try.

Id: [0x0024CDB4]
To victory, and to Sparta.

Id: [0x0024CDB5]
That woman is full of surprises.

Id: [0x0024CDB6]
You certainly proved that when you exposed her past.

Id: [0x0024CDB7]
Ah, well!

Id: [0x0024CDB8]
Our first drink will be to Kyra, then.

Id: [0x0024CFDB]

Id: [0x0024D1B4]
I'll tell you all about it when I'm back.

Id: [0x0024D511]
You! I know you. You're the mercenary they say killed the Wolf.

Id: [0x0024D519]
Well they're right, whoever they are. And your Spartan general deserved what he got.

Id: [0x0024D51A]
Then it is my duty to cut you down where you stand, traitor.

Id: [0x0024D51C]
You must be thinking of someone else. I only ever kill bears.

Id: [0x0024D51D]
Oh... well, in that case, you still look like a mighty warrior, and I could use some help.

Id: [0x0024D51F]
If you'd been with the Spartans during their push through Megaris, you'd know the Wolf had many enemies.

Id: [0x0024D520]
Maybe I'm getting you mixed up with the mercenary Hyrkanos. [beat]Well, it doesn't matter. I could use your help with something.

Id: [0x0024D522]
Go on.

Id: [0x0024D523]
With the Wolf dead, Athens has sent an onslaught of mercenaries against our camps. Seems they're trying to capitalize on all the underworked mercenaries since his death.

Id: [0x0024D528]
You! <i>Misthios</i>! You're the one who won the battle for Megaris for us Spartans!

Id: [0x0024D531]
Your army needed a champion, and I responded. Easy.

Id: [0x0024D533]
There were things I needed done... Acting as their champion was a necessary move.

Id: [0x0024D535]
Thanks to you, Athenian efforts are fractured in this area, and my regiment is finally ready to strike.

Id: [0x0024D536]
What do you need?

Id: [0x0024D537]
A certain Athenian commander is all that stands in our way to victory.

Id: [0x0024D539]
Thank the gods Sparta has been rid of the awful traitor king, Pausanias. May we never see the likes of him again.

Id: [0x0024D53F]
That traitor deserved worse than exile for all the terrible things he did.

Id: [0x0024D541]
At least now Sparta can move back into the light and look out for the peoples' best interests.

Id: [0x0024D543]
And now that Pausanias is out of the the way, we need to take down his right hand man, his most <i>superior</i> Spartan commander. He's capitalizing on the empty place Pausanias left behind.

Id: [0x0024D545]
The eagle-bearing <i>misthios</i>! I thought you were a legend.

Id: [0x0024D54B]
You heard right, Spartan. I am a legend.

Id: [0x0024D54D]
Those legends are only stories. I am just a humble mercenary.

Id: [0x0024D54F]
I've heard stories about how you worked with the Spartans in Megaris and helped them to victory![beat]I've also heard you have something to do with the Wolf's disappearance.

Id: [0x0024D550]
You can't believe everything you hear.

Id: [0x0024D551]
Sadly, with the Wolf gone, fear has spread through our ranks. There's actually a small group of conspirators claiming Nikolaos isn't dead, but a deserter. They're alleging no one's seen his body.

Id: [0x0024D552]
That's crazy. Everyone know he's dead.

Id: [0x0024D553]
That may be, but these men are convinced. They're deserting their posts and encouraging others to follow. They need to be stopped.

Id: [0x0024D55C]
An eagle-bearing <i>misthios</i>. Brasidas must have sent you.

Id: [0x0024D562]
I've met a Spartan named Brasidas, but he never mentioned anything about sending me anywhere.

Id: [0x0024D563]
Oh, no need to be secretive. I know it's generally frowned upon to hire mercenaries for the Spartan army... but we're glad to have you.

Id: [0x0024D565]
I'm a mercenary, not a servant. Brasidas didn't send me anywhere.

Id: [0x0024D566]
So fierce! So proud! And boy does Brasidas like his mercenaries interesting! You've got quite the attitude on you.

Id: [0x0024D568]
Really, I -

Id: [0x0024D569]
It's a good thing he did send you. I need to make sure the nearby camp is cleared of Athenians before the Spartan troops can move in.

Id: [0x0024D56D]
You, traitor! You deserved to be killed for killing our general, Stentor of Sparta.

Id: [0x0024D575]
I don't know anyone named Stentor. You must be thinking of someone else.

Id: [0x0024D576]
I thought I heard that the <i>misthios</i> that killed him had an eagle or something... Maybe I was wrong.

Id: [0x0024D577]
Maybe you were.

Id: [0x0024D579]
The man you speak of was my brother.

Id: [0x0024D57A]
Oh, I had no idea. My condolences, <i>misthios</i>. Maybe I confused you with someone else.

Id: [0x0024D57B]
Maybe you did.

Id: [0x0024D57D]
I did kill Stentor. He left me no choice.

Id: [0x0024D57E]
I knew it was you! I'll do what the Spartan soldiers should have done at camp!

Id: [0x0024D580]
Come to think of it... I did hear of another strange mercenary who arrived here recently. He must be the real traitor!

Id: [0x0024D58A]
I know you, Child of the Mountain. Was it you who interfered with the Krypteia and incited a helot riot?

Id: [0x0024D592]
I would never interfere with matters that don't concern me. Another self-serving mercenary started that riot.

Id: [0x0024D593]
Well if it wasn't you, then... The mercenary hired for the job is still out there. They must be stopped before they disrupt Spartan order even further.

Id: [0x0024D595]
Of course it was me who started that riot. Who else?

Id: [0x0024D596]
Then you should pay for your crimes against Sparta. House of Agiad or not, <i>misthios</i>, you're not welcome in Sparta anymore.

Id: [0x0024D598]
What happened at that riot was meant to be. The krypteia are evil and should stop killing innocent slaves.

Id: [0x0024D599]
The Krypteia are necessary! Helots outnumber us ten to one, and we need to keep them in line. I know you are guilty of this crime, Eagle Bearer. And you will pay for it.

Id: [0x0024D5AD]
Well, if it isn't the great "hero" of Megaris come to save us all.

Id: [0x0024D5AE]
You lose drachmae betting on Athens?

Id: [0x0024D5AF]
Hardly! Megara had been stable for awhile. I equipped the Athenians for their battles until you wiped them all out. Now there's no one left to pay me.

Id: [0x0024D5B5]
War takes more than drachmae from most, friend. Count yourself lucky.

Id: [0x0024D5B8]
The Athenians got what was coming for them, and so did you if you weren't smart enough to get paid up front.

Id: [0x0024D5BA]
Bah! Keep your advice. If you really wanted to make it up to me, you'd help me get what's rightfully mine from the Athenians.

Id: [0x0024D5CF]
A <i>misthios</i> with an eagle. You must be the one who killed the Monger.

Id: [0x0024D5D5]
You're right. It was me who killed the Monger.

Id: [0x0024D5D6]
While most of us are grateful for what you did, we shopkeepers no longer have the protection we once did under the Monger's eye.

Id: [0x0024D5D8]
You must have the wrong eagle-bearing mercenary. It wasn't me who killed the Monger.

Id: [0x0024D5D9]
Ah, sorry about that. I was really hoping to find the person responsible. Ever since the Monger was killed, we shopkeepers have lost the protection he once gave us.

Id: [0x0024D5DB]
Protection from who?

Id: [0x0024D5DC]
Pirates. The Monger's men used to patrol the waters around here to ensure our goods had safe passage. Now the pirates are ransacking everything we try to import.

Id: [0x0024D5F0]
You! You sail aboard the Adrestia with Barnabas!

Id: [0x0024D5F1]
How do you know this, stranger?

Id: [0x0024D5F2]
I once stood alongside him, until a filthy pirate ran his blade through my back. Now I can barely stand straight. I was replaced by you.

Id: [0x0024D5F8]
I'm sorry to hear of your injury. I had no idea I was taking anyone's place.

Id: [0x0024D5F9]
The worst part is I always dreamed of sailing with my son. But with my back, I can't even collect enough wood to build a felluca for him.

Id: [0x0024D5FB]
I had nothing to do with your back or Barnabas's decision.

Id: [0x0024D5FC]
Now I'll never get to sail with my son. You took everything from me. Now I'll take everything from you!

Id: [0x0024D600]
I know you, mercenary. I helped smuggle that poor girl Kleio onto a ship, only to have you bring her back to port.

Id: [0x0024D606]
She's safe with the hetaerae. Anthousa will watch over her.

Id: [0x0024D607]
That may be, but she's miserable here. She hasn't smiled in days.

Id: [0x0024D608]
You care for her.

Id: [0x0024D609]
I... I have a gift for her. It's not much, but it might cheer her up. She's not seeing visitors, though, so it needs to go to another hetaera. And well, I'd prefer she not know it's from me.

Id: [0x0024D60B]
I was paid to bring her back, not to let her escape.

Id: [0x0024D60C]
You may as well have locked her up, then. You had no right to decide her fate for her.

Id: [0x0024D60F]
Heard the Cyclops sent his lackeys to your house, mercenary. Why didn't you kill those thugs when you had the chance?

Id: [0x0024D615]
I sent them on their way. Not unscathed, but mostly in one piece. It wasn't my call to decide their fates.

Id: [0x0024D617]
They won't be bothering me anymore. That's all I care about.

Id: [0x0024D619]
You mercenaries only think of yourselves. After they left your place, they shook down my stall and kidnapped my wife! She's being held in a raider camp until I pay ransom to their chief.

Id: [0x0024D620]
I know what you're thinking. A traveling merchant who can't travel, pathetic!

Id: [0x0024D626]
I wasn't thinking that at all. You looked like you needed help.

Id: [0x0024D628]
Now that you mention it, that is pretty pathetic.

Id: [0x0024D62A]
It's sad. Not that long ago there was a terrible tragedy in the port of Korinth. People died! And ever since then, I've been unable to do business with one of the richest cities in the Greek world.

Id: [0x0024D62B]
Because you're scared?

Id: [0x0024D62C]
Do you know how many pirates roam these waters? What if there's another tragedy? And more people die? If the path was clear for my ship to embark, I'd go. But I'll starve while I wait for that.

Id: [0x0024D64B]
You're the <i>misthios</i> Eteokles spoke of!

Id: [0x0024D64C]
Who?

Id: [0x0024D64D]
The farmer who owned the white bull. He was sick, you made a sacrifice to the gods in his name. He's a good friend of mine.

Id: [0x0024D64E]
Ah yes. And how is Eteokles?

Id: [0x0024D64F]
He's dead.

Id: [0x0024D655]
The gods are cruel. The only time they show up is to cause more suffering.

Id: [0x0024D657]
Asklepios himself couldn't have cured that farmer.

Id: [0x0024D659]
Your sacrifice warmed his dying heart. He offered me whatever food was left on his land, but rotten bandits took over the farm. He deserved better.

Id: [0x0024D65B]
The Cyclops sent my brother on a gig, and he hasn't come back. He even missed family dinner! He never misses family dinner.

Id: [0x0024D65C]
What kind of job was it?

Id: [0x0024D65D]
He was sent to rough up some mercenary working for that fool, Markos.

Id: [0x0024D665]
I'm the mercenary working for Markos. I greeted your brother the way I greet most people who knock on my door with a blade in hand.

Id: [0x0024D666]
How's that?

Id: [0x0024D667]
I killed him.

Id: [0x0024D668]
You... you what? You'll pay for this, mercenary!

Id: [0x0024D66A]
You know, I actually know the Cyclops really well, and he told me he had big plans for your brother. Something about an undercover job and making it big.

Id: [0x0024D66B]
Good ole Dion is finally moving up in the world! I knew he could do it! I should get a message to his wife. Wouldn't want her thinking he's dead...

Id: [0x0024D66D]
Working with the Cyclops gets you into trouble with powerful people. Maybe your brother had to leave town.

Id: [0x0024D66E]
Dion would never leave town without telling me. What kind of a brother do you think he is? Expect a bounty on your head, mercenary.

Id: [0x0024D670]
Want in on a good deal? The Monger - you know, Korinth's biggest, baddest <i>malákas</i> around - is recruiting. And we're looking for big, bad, bear-slaying warriors like you.

Id: [0x0024D671]
Recruiting? The Monger is dead.

Id: [0x0024D672]
How do you know that?

Id: [0x0024D678]
Your... uh, grandmother told me that the Monger died recently.

Id: [0x0024D679]
You can't believe everything that old hag says. Sure, he's been missing, but I know how to bring him out of hiding. We need to kill him a bear so he can wear its skin like a crown!

Id: [0x0024D67B]
I know because I'm the one that killed him.

Id: [0x0024D67C]
You?! Killed him? You will pay for cutting down the greatest villain Korinthia has ever known!

Id: [0x0024D67E]
You're the <i>misthios</i> that got involved with Metiochos and those fishermen right? One of those guys is my brother.

Id: [0x0024D67F]
Uh... glad I could help?

Id: [0x0024D680]
And I heard about your speech about "restoring the city." You really inspired me! Got me thinking about how to make these big, influential types pay for what they've done.

Id: [0x0024D686]
No, you've got it all wrong. I told those fisherman they couldn't just fight fire with fire.

Id: [0x0024D688]
Don't be an idiot. I told those fisherman they need to find another way to deal with their city issues. Otherwise, they'd have to answer to me.

Id: [0x0024D68A]
You don't have to pretend with me. I know you want to take out the problematic elites so our city can be truly run by the people. Why else would you let the fishermen go? I'm doing my part.

Id: [0x0024D68B]
And what is your part, exactly?

Id: [0x0024D68C]
I'm hitting elites every way I can. Killing them, their wives. Even threatening their children. Only trouble is, someone got wind of the good work I'm doing for you. Now, soldiers are coming to kill me.

Id: [0x0024D695]
I can't see why, in Zeus's good name, Perikles would agree to have a private audience with the likes of you.

Id: [0x0024D69D]
If all he has to choose between is you and me, I think I understand his choice.

Id: [0x0024D69E]
And you're rude! I have to say, Perikles keeps strange company.

Id: [0x0024D6A0]
Herodotos, a good friend of Perikles, introduced me to him. That's all.

Id: [0x0024D6A1]
Zeus's beard. Herodotos hasn't been a fan of me since I called him Athens's finest attention seeker...

Id: [0x0024D6A3]
Obviously he agreed to meet with me because of my charm and stunning good looks.

Id: [0x0024D6A4]
Yes, that all makes sense now. I have heard rumors that he admires your kind.

Id: [0x0024D6A6]
Why do you care, anyway?

Id: [0x0024D6A7]
Because ever since you met him, he stopped inviting me to his parties. [beat]But a bribe sent to his second in command through <i>your</i> influential hands is sure to get me into his symposium.

Id: [0x0024D6A9]
Oh. It's you. I... might owe you an apology... And need your help with something.

Id: [0x0024D6AA]
Do I know you?

Id: [0x0024D6AB]
Alkibiades never mentioned me, his most tender lover? He certainly told me a great deal about <i>you</i>.

Id: [0x0024D6B3]
I'm not sure what he said about me, but I have a bad feeling about this.

Id: [0x0024D6B4]
He was detailed enough. When I heard about your... fling with Alkibiades, I'll admit I may have lost my head.

Id: [0x0024D6B5]
What did you do?

Id: [0x0024D6B6]
After far too much wine, I hired a mercenary to kill him. [beat]In retrospect, I acted rashly. The mercenary should probably be stopped.

Id: [0x0024D6B8]
Funny, Alkibiades never spoke of you.

Id: [0x0024D6BB]
Alkibiades and I have done many things, but talk isn't one of them.

Id: [0x0024D6BD]
I know who you are, and I wanted to thank you, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0024D6BE]
For what?

Id: [0x0024D6BF]
You remember the oracle you talked to at Delphi? She's my cousin. You helped her realize the error of her ways, and she ran away from the Cult. She told me everything.

Id: [0x0024D6C5]
I wasn't sure what happened to her when I left Delphi. I'm glad to know she's all right.

Id: [0x0024D6C6]
As am I. But the Cult of Kosmos is searching everywhere for her. I need your help.

Id: [0x0024D6C8]
The oracle was working for some horrible people. She should be ashamed of what she did for them.

Id: [0x0024D6C9]
She is! She's trying to make up for what she did. Please though, they're searching for her everywhere, and we need to get the Cult of Kosmos off her scent.

Id: [0x0024D6CB]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024D6CC]
My neighbor recognized her and is blackmailing us, saying if I don't give him all my earnings, he'll claim the reward on her head. But with my neighbor gone, our troubles would be over.

Id: [0x0024D6CE]
You! You're the mercenary my lovely Anthousa spoke of. I've heard you have some sway with her.

Id: [0x0024D6CF]
"Your" Anthousa? I didn't know she was tied down.

Id: [0x0024D6D0]
She and I have a unique connection. [beat]If she would only see it. There is someone else who's caught her eye.

Id: [0x0024D6D1]
Only one person?

Id: [0x0024D6D2]
A penniless writer who whispers empty words in Anthousa's ear. I've heard she doesn't even bestow gifts upon my love. She's clearly using her.

Id: [0x0024D6D3]
So where do I come into this?

Id: [0x0024D6D4]
Maybe if someone with Anthousa's approval found a reason to dispose of this writer, Anthousa would see clearly.

Id: [0x0024D6D6]
I saw you at the Pnyx while Perikles was giving his speech. Are you an Athenian citizien?

Id: [0x0024D6DE]
I'm not an Athenian, but I am a mercenary, so I wouldn't cause any trouble if I were you.

Id: [0x0024D6DF]
Right. Well. Maybe you would benefit from showing your loyalty to the great city of Athens!

Id: [0x0024D6E1]
Oh, I sure am an Athenian. And I, uh... have so many friends who can prove it!

Id: [0x0024D6E2]
Oh! Sorry, you just don't look like you're from around here, that’s all. Listen, since you're here, I could use your help.

Id: [0x0024D6E4]
What does it matter? I am here on important business.

Id: [0x0024D6E5]
Important business, right! Only a spy would evade a question like that, and spies are not welcome here. Expect to see a bounty on your head, traitor!

Id: [0x0024D6E7]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024D6E8]
You heard Kleon. A Spartan commander is mobilizing forces outside our gates, and Perikles does nothing. We need to show the Spartans that we aren't cowards in here.

Id: [0x0024D771]
I'm losing everything. Not only was my brother Elpenor murdered, but my whole political career is about to disappear, too.

Id: [0x0024D779]
I am the one who killed your brother.

Id: [0x0024D77A]
You? You bastard! You will pay for what you did to him! He was massacred! You deserve a fate worse than death.

Id: [0x0024D77C]
Elpenor? Can't say I've heard of him.

Id: [0x0024D781]
I know what it's like to lose family. Toughest thing you'll ever face in your life.

Id: [0x0024D785]
<i>Misthios</i>, hear me, I've seen it! The fall of Athens as we know it!

Id: [0x0024D786]
You've seen <i>what</i>?

Id: [0x0024D787]
The flower that withers under the loving gaze of the sun. A great sickness is on the horizon. Despair will consume Athens.

Id: [0x0024D78F]
That was some... um... beautiful poetry.

Id: [0x0024D790]
It wasn't poetry. This is real danger I'm talking about! And I need you to do something about it.

Id: [0x0024D794]
I have no idea what you're on about.

Id: [0x0024D795]
No one listens to my truth. Even if you don't believe me, <i>misthios</i>, maybe you can still help me?

Id: [0x0024D797]
Sicknesses bringing entire cities to their knees. This only happens in stories.

Id: [0x0024D798]
This is no tale of fallen heroes, <i>misthios</i>. This is reality, and your fate is now intertwined with mine. I need something from you.

Id: [0x0024D7A9]
I knew I recognized you. I may not look it, but I am better off because of you, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024D7AF]
I hate to say it, but you don't seem all that well off.

Id: [0x0024D7B0]
That's because the Athenians took everything from me before those masterful Spartans came along.

Id: [0x0024D7B2]
You... uh... look to be in great health!

Id: [0x0024D7B3]
Don't lie to me, you brute. I would look as good as you say if the Athenians hadn't taken my life out from underneath me before the Spartans turned up.

Id: [0x0024D7B5]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0024D7B6]
The Athenians took all my drachmae and drove me from my home before the Spartans took Megaris. Thanks to you, their forces are in shambles, and it's the perfect time for me to take back what's mine.

Id: [0x0024D7C9]
You better watch yourself, <i>maláka</i>!

Id: [0x0024D7CA]
What is it, old man?

Id: [0x0024D7CB]
You killed my brother in Megaris while he was fighting for his life against the Spartans. He died, and now my whole family lives on the streets.

Id: [0x0024D7D1]
If your brother hadn't gotten in the way of my job, he wouldn't have suffered.

Id: [0x0024D7D2]
He was hungry! Mercenary or not, your honor binds you to serve me now. Make up for what you've done.

Id: [0x0024D7D3]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024D7D4]
Some drachmae to put food on the table for my family would be a good start. I also accept payment in Spartan blood.

Id: [0x0024D7D6]
I don't know what you're on about, old man. I haven't killed anyone's brother.

Id: [0x0024D7D7]
You are a liar, Eagle Bearer! I know it was you, and you will pay for the lies you have told.

Id: [0x0024D7D9]
I know you. You're the shit-eating mercenary that killed Lagos. The one he put a bounty out for.

Id: [0x0024D7DA]
I did kill Lagos. Call me a shit-eater one more time, and you're next.

Id: [0x0024D7DB]
Would you prefer a <i>malákas</i> god-fucker, then? I'm not sure I can find language foul enough for the asshole that murdered Lagos and cast Arkadia into ruin.

Id: [0x0024D7E1]
I killed a man. I didn't curse Arkadia.

Id: [0x0024D7E2]
Maybe you didn't curse it outright, but you clearly angered the gods. After Lagos died, bandits and wild beasts tore our farms apart. My family lost everything.

Id: [0x0024D7E3]
You sure this misfortune is the wrath of the gods and not a sign of Arkadia's instability?

Id: [0x0024D7E4]
Whatever it is, it cost me my farm, my livelihood. I want blood in return. Whether it's yours, the bandits', or the beasts', I don't really care.

Id: [0x0024D7E6]
I've heard enough. It's time to cut out that filthy tongue.

Id: [0x0024D7E8]
Mighty <i>misthios</i>, hear me. I am a lowly Athenian and I need help. You look like the type that can get things done.

Id: [0x0024D7EE]
Easy. There isn't anything I can't do, really. What do you need?

Id: [0x0024D7F0]
I can't guarantee that you'll get what you want, but I can try to help you.

Id: [0x0024D7F2]
You are too kind, mighty <i>misthios</i>. It may sound ridiculous, but it is my dream to become a sophist like the great Thrasymachos, or the even greater Protagoras, and to leave this lowly life behind.

Id: [0x0024D7F3]
I get it. What's the issue?

Id: [0x0024D7F4]
I can't pay for lessons. I am sure I would make a fantastic sophist, and with a mighty misthios such as yourself being in Athens, this could be my chance to get the drachmae.

Id: [0x0024D7F8]
Ever since the Monger was killed, thieves have been running rampant in the city, burning and looting our homes and trying to find out who killed him. I can't sleep at night knowing I could be next.

Id: [0x0024D7FE]
I'm... the one that killed that <i>malákas</i>.

Id: [0x0024D7FF]
I won't say it's a terrible loss, but we've got other problems now. Those thieves need to be dealt with and quick!

Id: [0x0024D801]
I heard that Anthousa and her ladies took the Monger down.

Id: [0x0024D802]
It doesn't matter who did it, what matters is our lives are once again at stake. These troublesome thieves need to be run out of town!

Id: [0x0024D804]
The krypteia have always been a thorn in our side. They kill us helots because they're scared we'll revolt. We finally had the chance to riot against them and we missed it.

Id: [0x0024D80A]
There's always a chance. Riot or not, if you want respect from the Spartan community, you need to push for it.

Id: [0x0024D80B]
You're right! If we don't move now, we may never. I know something that would get the helots ready to riot again... the head of a Spartan commander.

Id: [0x0024D80D]
You're wrong. There's always time for change, but it's best to keep a level head and wait for the right moment.

Id: [0x0024D80E]
You're right, I better formulate a new plan and take my time before jumping into a new rebellion. Thanks for the advice, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024D812]
I am grateful for what you did for us, but sometimes I wish the aristocracy would mind their own business.

Id: [0x0024D813]
What are you talking about? I'm just a mercenary.

Id: [0x0024D814]
I know who you are, Child of the Mountain. But now that you've interfered with the kryptes and helped us slaves out, we're having even more issues with the Spartan soldiers.

Id: [0x0024D81A]
I did what was necessary, what was right. What the Spartan krypteia is doing is cruel to the slaves.

Id: [0x0024D81C]
You're right. I should have stuck to the plan and dealt with the Spartan krypteia without involving you.

Id: [0x0024D81E]
Because of you, the remaining krypteia soldiers pillage our villages at night. If you want to help make up for what you did, take the rest of them out so we can have peace.

Id: [0x0024D82B]
I heard you hate bald people.

Id: [0x0024D82C]
What?

Id: [0x0024D82D]
It's OK. I hate bald people too. That Hippokrates is one ugly malákas.

Id: [0x0024D833]
Bald or not, Hippokrates is a nice man. I don't think he should be judged on his hair loss.

Id: [0x0024D834]
It doesn't matter if he's nice, he just shouldn't be bald. I have a cure, though, and it isn't herbs.

Id: [0x0024D836]
You may have a point. Hippokrates <i>is</i> pretty ugly.

Id: [0x0024D837]
I knew you'd agree with me. It's all right though, I have something that will help him more than any herb could.

Id: [0x0024D839]
And what is that?

Id: [0x0024D83A]
Hippokrates's ugly bald pate has given me inspiration. Do you know what makes a good substitute for hair? Bear hair! If all the bears around here were to drop dead, I may cure this world of baldness.

Id: [0x0024D83C]
Ah, the misthios sent by Zeus. They say you've been working for the good doctor, Hippokrates.

Id: [0x0024D83D]
I came to Argolis to meet him, actually.

Id: [0x0024D83E]
Hasn't everyone? I can't complain, though. Ever since he came to Argolis, my business has been booming. It's great, but I can't keep up with the demand for my herbs. Think you could help me?

Id: [0x0024D844]
I'm a mercenary, lady. I don't do favors.

Id: [0x0024D845]
Ah, I heard you charge exorbitant prices. I'm sorry, but I don't have that kind of drachmae. I suppose Hippokrates didn't teach you anything about empathy for those in need.

Id: [0x0024D847]
I could be of some help.

Id: [0x0024D848]
You are much kinder than Hippokrates's assistant, Sostratos, made you out to be. [beat]Helen, the village midwife is in need of this herb delivery.

Id: [0x0024D84A]
Oh <i>misthios</i>, my life is over. My baby, she was taken from me. Stolen!

Id: [0x0024D84B]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0024D84C]
The priests at Asklepios say she died, but I know it isn't true. They all think I'm scum for having a baby in the first place... and now she's gone. I want my revenge.

Id: [0x0024D854]
You've come to the right mercenary. I take revenge for a living.

Id: [0x0024D857]
You're right to want revenge against those corrupt priests.

Id: [0x0024D859]
It wasn't the priests at Asklepios... Not really. Your baby was taken by a crazy priestess named Chrysis and died when her temple caught fire.

Id: [0x0024D85A]
You were there?! You had something to do with this? Then I will get my revenge against you. Mark my words.

Id: [0x0024D85C]
Oh good, it's you. The gods must have heard my prayers.

Id: [0x0024D862]
Here I am. Gods' blessing and all.

Id: [0x0024D864]
Don't believe everything you hear. I'm just a mercenary, lady.

Id: [0x0024D866]
I heard of your kindness towards Hippokrates, and how you helped him with his errands. I have something I could use your help with, too, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0024D867]
And what would that be?

Id: [0x0024D868]
Religious fanatics have been stealing valuables from my temple in protest of my work with Hippokrates. These thieves need to be dealt with before the situation gets worse.

Id: [0x0024DACA]
My lover told me of you, Eagle Bearer. You are a hero.

Id: [0x0024DAD3]
I have no idea what you're talking about, but heroic just about describes me.

Id: [0x0024DAD5]
I'm not sure what you're talking about, but I'm a mercenary, and chances are I was just doing my job.

Id: [0x0024DAD8]
I don't think I recall meeting this lover of yours, but they do have good taste.

Id: [0x0024DADA]
You're a funny one, <i>misthios</i>. My lover was one of the women you helped in Megaris. The stories about how the war is starving them all breaks my heart.

Id: [0x0024DADB]
And?

Id: [0x0024DADC]
I would like to send a shipment of food to the Megarians, but we need more meat. I'd like your help hunting down a troublesome pack of wolves.

Id: [0x0024DAE2]
I know you killed the Monger, you home-wrecking <i>malákas</i>.

Id: [0x0024DAEC]
You're right. I killed that pig so everyone could see.

Id: [0x0024DAED]
That <i>pig</i> was my husband-to-be. And because of you, I'm destined to be a hetaera for my entire life and die an old maid. You've killed any chance I had at a normal life.

Id: [0x0024DAEF]
I... don’t know what you're talking about.

Id: [0x0024DAF0]
If it wasn't you who killed my husband-to-be, you're going to find the fucker who did. I want you to go out there and kill the mercenary that slit his throat.

Id: [0x0024DAF2]
I don't understand why you're so upset. The Monger was running Korinthia into the ground.

Id: [0x0024DAF3]
Who cares about Korinthia?! I care about my own fucking life that you've ruined. He was going to marry me. Me! How many chances do you think a hetaera gets in a lifetime?

Id: [0x0024DAF9]
You've been working for that pig, Kleon.

Id: [0x0024DB02]
Kleon can't be all that bad. He's just looking out for the people of Athens.

Id: [0x0024DB03]
Not bad! A man of the people? He cares more about power than us Athenians any day.

Id: [0x0024DB05]
Watch your tongue, lady. You don't know what I am capable of.

Id: [0x0024DB06]
Oh, I'm sure you're a mighty warrior. Kleon would hire only the best.

Id: [0x0024DB09]
When the pay is good, it doesn't matter who you're working for, really.

Id: [0x0024DB0A]
Your type disgust me. I won't have any of it. Expect a bounty raised on you, traitor.

Id: [0x0024DB0C]
Was there something you wanted?

Id: [0x0024DB0D]
After word of your support for Kleon spread, another hetaera began working for him. I need to stop her before she starts spreading poison amongst the others.

Id: [0x0024DB13]
No, not you. The gods are punishing me.

Id: [0x0024DB1A]
They never told me about their plans to punish you, but I'm sure I'm here for a reason.

Id: [0x0024DB1D]
I'm not sure what you did to anger the gods, but I'm just a passing mercenary.

Id: [0x0024DB1F]
Don't lie, Eagle Bearer. I know you had a hand in getting my sister killed.

Id: [0x0024DB20]
Your sister?

Id: [0x0024DB21]
The one and only Pythia of Delphi, the oracle herself. Even if you won't admit it, I know it's because she angered the Followers of Ares.

Id: [0x0024DB22]
Wait, it wasn't -

Id: [0x0024DB23]
Don't cover for them, <i>misthios</i>. They're gathering nearby, and I want my revenge. You owe me.

Id: [0x0024DB67]
Eagle Bearer. You're gutsy to show your face around these parts after killing the Wolf of Sparta.

Id: [0x0024DB70]
Finishing one job won't stop me from looking for another. The Wolf might be dead, but that is in the past.

Id: [0x0024DB71]
I admire your courage, <i>misthios</i>. It's why I'm here.

Id: [0x0024DB74]
Are you sure you aren't thinking of someone else?

Id: [0x0024DB75]
No need to lie to me, <i>misthios</i>. I know the truth and admire you for it. That is why I'm here.

Id: [0x0024DB77]
A <i>misthios</i> will take work in whatever shape, so long as it pays.

Id: [0x0024DB78]
Well, clever one, perhaps you'll be interested in this particular job.

Id: [0x0024DB7B]
What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024DB7C]
Thanks to you, the Spartans are more vulnerable than ever. You've leveled the playing field. With the Wolf out of the way, now's our chance to strike.

Id: [0x0024DB81]
You did a stupid thing, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0024DB8A]
A bit rude to start a conversation off that way, don't you think?

Id: [0x0024DB8B]
Well lucky for you, that stupid move was the right one.

Id: [0x0024DB8D]
You should be very careful, Spartan, if you want to come out of this with your head.

Id: [0x0024DB8E]
Ooh, threatening. Well, it just so happens that your stupid move was the right one. Especially considering I'm no Spartan.

Id: [0x0024DB91]
In my kind of work, you run the risk of being both brilliant and stupid. It's a fine line.

Id: [0x0024DB92]
I... can imagine. Well, perhaps you didn't cross the line after all. Anyway, it's working out in the end.

Id: [0x0024DB94]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x0024DB95]
Now that you've accused Archidamos of being a traitor, Sparta is preoccupied with restoring its dignity. Now is the perfect time for us Athenians to push in... We need to clear out the nearest camp.

Id: [0x0024DBA0]
Psst. I know who you're really working for.

Id: [0x0024DBA1]
And who would that be?

Id: [0x0024DBA2]
You're working for the true leader of Athens: Kleon. I know what you've been doing for him.

Id: [0x0024DBAB]
Kleon is doing what he deems to be right for the people of Athens.

Id: [0x0024DBAC]
It's our duty to see him rise to the top. Your work is a start, but there's more to do. Perikles's personal guards have pledged to make Kleon's life... difficult.

Id: [0x0024DBAF]
Kleon is interesting. He seems to have the public's attention... the people love him.

Id: [0x0024DBB0]
And so they should! We need to help Kleon rise to the top, and the best way to do that is to kill off Perikles's guards, who are making Kleon's life miserable.

Id: [0x0024DBB3]
Kleon cares about his own power more than he cares about his people.

Id: [0x0024DBB4]
You obviously don't have your head on straight. You should leave Athens before you get in even bigger trouble.

Id: [0x0024DBBE]
For a while there, I thought Lagos had lost his way. Putting out bounties, starting fires, and all those foul-looking thugs hanging around. He turned real bloodthirsty.

Id: [0x0024DBBF]
And now?

Id: [0x0024DBC0]
Now all that seems to be in the past. He's back to the Lagos I knew as a boy. Prosperous and a leader, sure. But not ruthless. Arkadia is in good hands.

Id: [0x0024DBC1]
You knew him as a child?

Id: [0x0024DBC2]
Of course! He wasn't always the mighty archon, you know.

Id: [0x0024DBC9]
We all start somewhere, I suppose.

Id: [0x0024DBCB]
Tough to picture Lagos as a child. I've only seen him as a ruthless leader.

Id: [0x0024DBCE]
As a girl, he wove me a flower crown. I kept it ever since. I wonder if he remembers. [beat]Heard his wife left. Maybe I should leave the crown with one of his servants to... see what happens.

Id: [0x0024DC35]
Someone finally took care of that vengeful boar that kept rampaging through my fields.

Id: [0x0024DC36]
The Calydonian boar? That was me.

Id: [0x0024DC37]
You, mercenary? You must be sent by Artemis herself. That dumb pig tore through my fields for weeks.

Id: [0x0024DC3D]
Herakles himself would have struggled with the strength of that beast.

Id: [0x0024DC3F]
A hunter might have made a cleaner kill, but I got the job done.

Id: [0x0024DC41]
You've done me a huge favor. But there's more I could use your help with. The farmers here believe that the gods sent the boar to ravage the land.

Id: [0x0024DC42]
Why is that?

Id: [0x0024DC43]
It appeared not long after raiders stole an offering from a nearby temple. Until its return, I fear our fields will suffer.

Id: [0x0024DC45]
What a terrible day.

Id: [0x0024DC46]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x0024DC47]
I should be jumping for joy, but... My daughter was recently rescued from a terrible near-shipwreck in Korinth. While I'm happy she's alive, her being around is almost more trouble than it's worth.

Id: [0x0024DC4D]
That heroic mercenary that pulled your daughter from the shipwreck? That was me.

Id: [0x0024DC4E]
Well, then since you got me in this mess, you can get me out. Ever since my daughter got home, her suitor has been a thorn in my side. I want him gone. Oh, and did I mention he's the region leader?

Id: [0x0024DC50]
First she gets caught up with the Monger, and now she's in more trouble? Your daughter does sound like a problem.

Id: [0x0024DC51]
She is! Now that she's back, her horrible suitor has been hanging around my house, being a pain in the ass! I want him out of our lives... Did I mention he's the region leader?

Id: [0x0024DC53]
Eagle Bearer! I saw you at the docks. You killed those innocent people.

Id: [0x0024DC5B]
In this middle of this war, it's hard to claim anyone as innocent.

Id: [0x0024DC5C]
You... you're right. This war has taken so much from me. My home, my land, and now my friends.

Id: [0x0024DC5D]
I know the feeling.

Id: [0x0024DC5E]
Now that they're gone, I would like to give my friends a proper burial. An offering brought to the temple's priestess would bring a good omen.

Id: [0x0024DC60]
I don't know what you're talking about. I never visited the docks.

Id: [0x0024DC61]
You're a liar! And a terrible one at that. I won't let you get away with it. My friends are dead because of you!

Id: [0x0024DC63]
You're right. I did kill them, but these matters are never as black and white as they appear to be.

Id: [0x0024DC64]
You mercenaries are nothing but scum. As if I hadn't already lost enough in this foresaken war. You will be sorry you chose such a meaningless way of life.

Id: [0x0024DC66]
You look just like her.

Id: [0x0024DC67]
Who?

Id: [0x0024DC68]
Phoenix, leader of Naxos. I can see it in your eyes. You must be related.

Id: [0x0024DC6E]
You are right. We are related.

Id: [0x0024DC6F]
I knew it! Ever since she arrived on Naxos, things have been much better for us. But when Phoenix picked a fight with Paros, the Athenian army started stealing all our fish right from under our noses.

Id: [0x0024DC71]
I don't know what you're talking about.

Id: [0x0024DC72]
Strange. I have such a good talent for spotting those things. Well, since you're here, we've been having trouble with our neighbors, the Athenians. They keep stealing our fresh fish.

Id: [0x0024DC7A]
I sure am glad to see you, Eagle Bearer... I might have done something pretty bad.

Id: [0x0024DC7B]
Like what?

Id: [0x0024DC7C]
Well, I heard that Markos and you had been fairly forgiving of Duris for not paying him what he owes... and thought I might be untouchable, too.

Id: [0x0024DC82]
Duris didn't deserve to go bankrupt. I know he'll make up for it later.

Id: [0x0024DC83]
Too kind, <i>misthios</i>. Too kind. I just seem to be in bigger trouble than I thought. I didn't pay the bandits what I owed them, either, and now they're out for my head.

Id: [0x0024DC85]
Duris was stupid for not paying his debts, and you're no better.

Id: [0x0024DC86]
You're so right, <i>misthios</i>! But... I seem to be in bigger trouble now. I didn't pay my debt to the bandits, either, and now they're out for my head.

Id: [0x0024DC89]
You! Oh, my husband told me about how you spared his life in the fishing district.

Id: [0x0024DC8F]
Well, your husband could have been in a lot of trouble threatening a man like the politician Metiochos, but I know he and his friends meant well.

Id: [0x0024DC91]
Your husband should be more careful. He and his friends could have gotten in a lot of trouble threatening the politician Metiochos.

Id: [0x0024DC93]
Of course, you're right. But he took your advice, and a bunch of us Athenians have gotten together to help the fishing district... and now we need your help again, too.

Id: [0x0024DC94]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x0024DC95]
I'm too busy tending my stall, but I need to deliver these new sandals made for a local beggar. We have a clothing drive here now. See? I told you we're turning things around. All thanks to you.

Id: [0x0024DC97]
I've owed Markos money for a long time now, but no matter what I do with the business, it never picks up. After what he had his thugs do to Duris, we're in more trouble than ever.

Id: [0x0024DC9D]
I wouldn't worry about those thugs. Markos won't bother you.

Id: [0x0024DC9F]
Markos means business. If you owe him money, you should be worried.

Id: [0x0024DCA1]
It's worse than that, though. With all our money troubles, my husband took it upon himself to steal from some local bandits, and now they're out for us, too!

Id: [0x0024DCA3]
Eagle Bearer! I know what you did for my Himilko - how you stopped that traitorous Heitor from kililng him.

Id: [0x0024DCA9]
My job was to retrieve a sword for him, not act on some petty quest for vengeance.

Id: [0x0024DCAE]
The fight between him and your husband wasn't something I wanted to get involved with. It wasn't my place to kill him.

Id: [0x0024DCB0]
Well, I wholeheartedly thank you. [beat]I only wish our mercenary troubles were over.

Id: [0x0024DCB1]
Mercenary troubles?

Id: [0x0024DCB2]
I was really hoping the trouble with Heitor would teach my Himilko a lesson, but since returning home, he's gotten into trouble with yet another mercenary.

Id: [0x0024DCBE]
I'm not sure I dare to ask but... Are the rumors true about you, mercenary? Did you kill Lydos?

Id: [0x0024DCBF]
I did. What he did to his sister was demented.

Id: [0x0024DCC0]
Not just to his sister, <i>misthios</i>. But to women all over Korinth.

Id: [0x0024DCC1]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0024DCC2]
I... I supposed it's safe now that he's gone. Feels strange, though. Like he's still watching me. [beat]And my children.

Id: [0x0024DCC3]
It's all right.

Id: [0x0024DCC4]
Thank you, <i>misthios</i>. For all you've done. Truly. I'd just feel better if I knew his band of thugs was taken care of, as well. It's no secret that they harassed his victims, too.

Id: [0x0024DCC6]
I knew you'd come back!

Id: [0x0024DCC7]
What?

Id: [0x0024DCC8]
To Sparta, and with Myrrine in tow! I knew as soon as we got wind that a mysterious mercenary had come face to face with Nikolaos of Sparta that you'd return to reclaim your title as House Agiad.

Id: [0x0024DCD6]
It's been a long time since I've been here, but it's nice to be back.

Id: [0x0024DCD7]
And it's nice to have you back. We loved Myrrine deeply and were sad to see her go. I have to admit though, I am also happy you've returned so I can win that bet I made.

Id: [0x0024DCD9]
I don't have many fond memories of this place. It's hard to be back.

Id: [0x0024DCDA]
I don't blame you. I only heard stories, but those were horrific enough... I do have to admit though, I'm glad to have you back since I finally get to reap the benefits of the bet I won.

Id: [0x0024DCDC]
You... bet on my return?

Id: [0x0024DCDD]
I bet on all kinds of things. Nice to finally have one pan out! Trouble is, the Spartan commander that owes me a wheel of fine cheese is refusing to pay up.

Id: [0x0024DCE7]
Eagle Bearer! I don't know how to thank you.

Id: [0x0024DCED]
I accept your gratitude. I'm sure I've done something to warrant it.

Id: [0x0024DCEF]
I'm not sure what I've done that warrants your thanks.

Id: [0x0024DCF1]
You saved baby Alethea from that terrible witch, Chrysis. Because of you, both mother and child are reunited, and the whole village knows the mistake the priests of Asklepios made.

Id: [0x0024DCF2]
Hopefully no more innocent children will be taken from their mothers in the name of Hera.

Id: [0x0024DCF3]
Yes, we need to put a stop to this madness once and for all. The village hopes you will help them this one final time to destroy the remaining shrine that Chrysis built.

Id: [0x0024DCF6]
Then you must help me. The priest who took my baby from me was named Denes. He needs to pay for what he's done.

Id: [0x0024DD12]
You think you're so incredible, don't you?

Id: [0x0024DD13]
What?

Id: [0x0024DD14]
You play hero for the Spartan army in Megaris, and now you think you can do anything. [beat]Can't believe the town is asking me to build a statue of you.

Id: [0x0024DD1B]
What I did couldn't have been achieved by some <i>malákas</i> like you. Glad to hear I'm finally getting some recognition.

Id: [0x0024DD1D]
I did what had to be done. A statue may be... overdoing it.

Id: [0x0024DD1F]
Before I agree to making some statue in your honor, I want you to do something for the people. There's a pack of wolves that's been harassing my village. You want to be a real hero? Now's your chance.

Id: [0x0024DD20]
Wolves, huh?

Id: [0x0024DD21]
Yes, real wolves. Not just some self-important Spartan in a silly helmet.

Id: [0x0024DD33]
I can't contain myself. My lover has eyes poured from honey by Aphrodite herself. Her lips taste as if they were picked from pomegranate seeds. Her scent -

Id: [0x0024DD34]
I get the picture.

Id: [0x0024DD35]
But that's not even to speak of her soul. My darling Kleio's sweet wanderer's heart lead her to me all the way from Korinth!

Id: [0x0024DD3B]
I actually provided safe passage for a hetaera named Kleio aboard my ship.

Id: [0x0024DD3C]
You? You are responsible for the happiness that courses through every fiber of my being?

Id: [0x0024DD3D]
Looks like it.

Id: [0x0024DD3F]
I'm a mercenary. If you don't need something bludgeoned or stabbed, I suggest you stop wasting my time.

Id: [0x0024DD41]
Oh, mercenary, this my lucky day. I had a ring I wished to get engraved for my darling Kleio, but it was stolen just this morning.

Id: [0x0024DD43]
The Pythia is dead! My life is over.

Id: [0x0024DD44]
The Oracle is dead?

Id: [0x0024DD45]
Yes, and now that's she's gone, I have to wait while they find a replacement. And until then, I can't receive my prophecy about my budding music career.

Id: [0x0024DD4B]
Your music career will be fine so long as you work hard. I wouldn't worry about it.

Id: [0x0024DD4C]
You really think so? [beat]Yeah! I can do this! With or without the Pythia.

Id: [0x0024DD4D]
That’s the spirit.

Id: [0x0024DD4E]
I may have acted rashly before, though... When I heard the Pythia had died, I lost all hope and tossed a chest of my instruments into the ocean.

Id: [0x0024DD50]
If I were you, I'd focus on a stable source of income for now. It could be awhile before they find a new pythia.

Id: [0x0024DD51]
You're right. I should just give up on my dreams. I'll never be a famous singer or lyrist without the Pythia. Thank you for putting things clearly.

Id: [0x0024DD53]
You, Eagle Bearer, are a legend.

Id: [0x0024DD54]
Why is that?

Id: [0x0024DD55]
You refused the advances of the famous Alkibiades, of course. I feel I should write a song in your honor.

Id: [0x0024DD5C]
I think a song of my heroics would suit me nicely. Refusing Alkibiades certainly is a feat.

Id: [0x0024DD5D]
But first I need to claim my prize. I bet a soldier friend of mine that you would be able to resist Alkibiades, and you did. Now that drachmae is mine, and I need you to go get it. He's not paying up.

Id: [0x0024DD5F]
I wouldn’t turn you down if you asked.

Id: [0x0024DD60]
Please! You're just as bad as Alkibiades himself.

Id: [0x0024DD62]
Mercenary! I've heard you've had dealings with Anthousa. Tell me, how do you think she'd feel about a man trying to control her personal life?

Id: [0x0024DD63]
I can scarcely imagine the man who'd try.

Id: [0x0024DD64]
Oh, he exists all right. A slimy politician is trying to stop me from seeing Anthousa. He's threatened by me.

Id: [0x0024DD65]
Why would he be threatened by you?

Id: [0x0024DD66]
Well, I'm not exactly her client. She lets me... see her free of charge. I compose the most lovely poems about her. [beat]She's a perfect muse.

Id: [0x0024DD6D]
No wonder the politician is jealous.

Id: [0x0024DD6F]
I see. Anyway, what's the politician doing about this?

Id: [0x0024DD71]
This pig is trying to run me out of town for it. He's even threatened to put a bounty on me.

Id: [0x0024DD78]
By the gods, it's really you! The legendary mercenary who travels with the great historian Herodotos.

Id: [0x0024DD79]
Er, yes. I met him during my travels in Phokis.

Id: [0x0024DD7A]
I know! I saw you talking while I was in line to meet the Pythia. Truthfully, I was only in line to see Herodotos. Anyway, I want to be a writer just like him. Is he as magnificent as they say?

Id: [0x0024DD81]
I have to admit that Herodotos is an interesting fellow. He seems to know everything about everyone.

Id: [0x0024DD82]
Just as I suspected! Since you are a fan just like me, perhaps there's something you could help me with?

Id: [0x0024DD85]
Magnificent? That might be going to far. He certainly is... something, if not a bit pushy.

Id: [0x0024DD86]
I would never have guessed! No... you must be joking. The fact that you know him is astounding enough. There's something I need to ask of you.

Id: [0x0024DD88]
Go on.

Id: [0x0024DD89]
Perhaps Herodotos would finally notice me if I started writing about his favorite muse. [beat]You! Maybe a story about you skinning a lion with your bare hands. Or wrestling a couple sharks?

Id: [0x0024DD9D]
You! Eagle Bearer, you were a great friend of General Brasidas of Sparta, were you not?

Id: [0x0024DDA5]
Brasidas and I worked together a few times.

Id: [0x0024DDA6]
I knew it! Brasidas was my cousin and the most wonderful man I ever knew!

Id: [0x0024DDA8]
Brasidas and I were very close, yes.

Id: [0x0024DDA9]
I knew it! He only ever said wonderful things about you. He was my cousin, you know.

Id: [0x0024DDAB]
I knew Brasidas, but we did not see eye to eye on a lot of things.

Id: [0x0024DDAC]
Oh... That is your loss. Brasidas was my cousin, and he was the most wonderful man. You would have been lucky to call him your friend.

Id: [0x0024DDAE]
Is that so...

Id: [0x0024DDAF]
I'd like to return his effects to his family, but a Spartan commander is holding onto them... tightly. As his best friend, you must know how important it is for his family to receive closure.

Id: [0x0024DDB1]
You! You're the misthios that fought alongside Stentor of Sparta in Boeotia, aren't you? I heard you spared his life!

Id: [0x0024DDB9]
As many issues as I've had with Stentor in the past, I know he means well...

Id: [0x0024DDBB]
That bastard has caused so much trouble for me. He should consider himself lucky to still be...

Id: [0x0024DDBD]
Well... he is my brother...

Id: [0x0024DDBF]
And he is so absolutely <i>handsome</i>. I want to win my next event in his honor.

Id: [0x0024DDC0]
You like him?

Id: [0x0024DDC1]
That's not the part that matters! I need him to <i>notice</i> me. Maybe if I could find a Spartan insignia to wear during my next event...

Id: [0x0024DDC7]
You! Beloved child of Zeus and Hera! You are officially the greatest being who ever lived.

Id: [0x0024DDCF]
I have traveled across the sea and back a hundred times. A few organized events won't stand in my way.

Id: [0x0024DDD0]
Of course they wouldn't. And you have given me a clarity to life I never imagined.

Id: [0x0024DDD2]
I have achieved what no mere mortal can achieve... until another mere mortal achieves it.

Id: [0x0024DDD3]
Nonsense. Once a mighty warrior, always a mighty warrior. You have given me great inspiration, <i>misthios</i>.

Id: [0x0024DDD5]
How so?

Id: [0x0024DDD6]
By winning the Olympics, you've made me realize how much time I've wasted worshipping Poseidon when I should have been devoted to Zeus.

Id: [0x0024DDD7]
So what now?

Id: [0x0024DDD8]
Before your heroics, I foolishly devoted a shrine to Poseidon. Now, I'd like to see it turned to dust, but wild beasts are drawn to the sacrifices I left there.

Id: [0x0024DDDC]
Eagle Bearer! I'm going to make you pay for killing my brother. You and Heitor messed with the wrong family.

Id: [0x0024DDE5]
You of all people should know how it works. Heitor hired a mercenary to deal with his problem. I just happened to take the job.

Id: [0x0024DDE6]
Oh, so that's all this is to you? A job? Well, this is personal for me, <i>maláka</i>. But you want to know how it feels? Fine. I'll let someone else take care of you.

Id: [0x0024DDE9]
I took the contract to kill a mercenary for Heitor. Doesn't matter if he was your brother. A job is a job, you know that.

Id: [0x0024DDEA]
At least you're an honest mercenary, <i>maláka</i>. And for that, I will deal with you in an honorable way.

Id: [0x0024DDEC]
I had nothing to do with your brother's death. Another mercenary took care of Heitor's job.

Id: [0x0024DDED]
Oh... Then the mercenary that did kill my brother needs to be sent to an early grave.

Id: [0x0024DDEF]
Brasidas was the first in the Spartan army to call mercenaries to his aid. He gave me my start, as well. I know you were close with him.

Id: [0x0024DDF0]
I was.

Id: [0x0024DDF1]
You know, our work for the Spartans isn't through...

Id: [0x0024DDF9]
I'd do anything for a friend of Brasidas. What do you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024DDFB]
Friend or not, mercenaries don't work for free. You should know that much. But what did you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024DDFD]
Your loyalties to Brasidas are admirable, but unusual for a mercenary. What did you have in mind?

Id: [0x0024DDFF]
Brasidas wouldn't be happy if he knew his work wasn't done. There's a camp of pesky Athenians that he had plans to hit in force before he... passed.

Id: [0x0024DE04]
With Lagos dead, the great hunt is on for us scavengers.

Id: [0x0024DE05]
The great hunt?

Id: [0x0024DE06]
For his hidden cache of riches, of course! Or did you think the patron of Demeter was foolish enough to put all his drachmae into grain?

Id: [0x0024DE07]
How hidden can it be if scavengers know to search for it?

Id: [0x0024DE08]
Not just searching. They're killing themselves for it. Turns out Lagos made enough people rich themselves that he's still got a loyal following attacking anyone who goes near it.

Id: [0x0024DE0E]
Maybe if people knew more about Lagos's associates, they wouldn't be so loyal.

Id: [0x0024DE10]
Regardless of how he came to power, Lagos was a prosperous leader for Arkadia.

Id: [0x0024DE12]
The man's dead and in the past. His fortune, however, could be in your future. I happen to know where Lagos kept his wealth. But I'm not risking my neck against his devoted followers.

Id: [0x0024DE17]
Can you confirm something for me, <i>misthios</i>? I heard Myrrine of house Agiad was back.

Id: [0x0024DE1D]
Those stories aren't true. Myrrine of Sparta will never come back here.

Id: [0x0024DE1E]
Thank the gods. I looted a family vase from their house, and it was confiscated by a commander. I'd be dead if they knew I had something to do with it, but boy, is that house a trove of riches.

Id: [0x0024DE20]
Yes, she's back. And I'm related to her.

Id: [0x0024DE21]
You should be ashamed of yourself, <i>misthios</i>. Your family has done nothing but bring shame to Sparta. I wish I had never laid eyes on you.

Id: [0x0024DE50]
You foul creature. You're barely worthy of fucking his goats, let alone Alkibiades. I was going to offer an apology, but I think I'll put a bounty on your head instead.

Id: [0x0024DEB4]
Elpenor was a kind and wealthy man. He financed my love for politics and protected me from harm. And now that he's gone, I risk losing everything I have left.

Id: [0x0024DEB5]
Is there something I can do?

Id: [0x0024DEB6]
Ever since my brother disappeared, bandits have been attacking me. They're after the family fortune, and I'm left defenseless. If they take the money from me, then I can't continue my political career.

Id: [0x0024E2AC]
PREXILEOS

Id: [0x0024E4F8]
Him I'm not so worried about, it's the principle of letting another boat in the waters I've always fished. Everyone who starts having bad luck will be stealing my fish if I do nothing.

Id: [0x0024E57A]
Are you the same eagle-bearing <i>misthios</i> that Alkibiades has spoken so fondly of?

Id: [0x0024E580]
It doesn't surprise me that he hasn't kept his mouth shut.

Id: [0x0024E581]
I would be careful if I were you, that man is a snake. I've been bitten one too many times.

Id: [0x0024E582]
That doesn't surprise me, either.

Id: [0x0024E583]
So you know why it's time to take revenge. I need these toxic herbs taken to the priestess at his favorite temple. She'll know what do from there. Time he stopped thinking with his dick...

Id: [0x0024E585]
Alkibiades? Never heard of him.

Id: [0x0024E586]
Oh? Well, in that case never mind.

Id: [0x0024E693]
What do you want?

Id: [0x0024E694]
Great warrior, you have arrived at just the right time. To save the city from despair, deliver this single wilted flower to the city physician. Only then will he know of the storm headed our way.

Gods curse Silanos and his damned Cult. Do they never tire of meddling?[&scream]

Id: [0x0024E998]
By teaching him to suffer. To know pain so well that he would learn to welcome it like an old friend. And now, he will teach all of the Greek world to know that pain.

Id: [0x0024E999]
[beat]Your mater was a weakling who whined to the gods like a pig on an altar. I am more a mother to her child than she will ever be. I can be a mother to you, too, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x0024ECF4]
And I always will.

Id: [0x0024ECF7]
I should gather the spoils of the hunt and get back to my people.

Id: [0x0024ECF9]
Take some with you. It's as much yours as it is mine.

Id: [0x0024EE08]
Welcome all, it is my pleasure to introduce to you Kallias. A former champion here in this stadium, and now an esteemed judge here in Olympia.

Id: [0x0024EE09]
My friends, it is an honor for me to introduce this event, one so close to my heart.

Id: [0x0024EE0A]
The pankration!

Id: [0x0024EE0B]
I will not delay you with words, for we all want to see action.

Id: [0x0024EE0C]
For Zeus, let the competition commence!

Id: [0x0024EE1B]
That was your best?

Id: [0x0024EE1C]
That was but the beginning.

Id: [0x0024EE1D]
What?

Id: [0x0024EE1F]
Now that our contestant is warmed up, let's see what she can do against ERASTOS!

Id: [0x0024EE22]
Good luck...

Id: [0x0024EE26]
Come to wish me luck?

Id: [0x0024EE27]
Of course, and if you win you should come dine with me sometime.

Id: [0x0024EE28]
Maybe I'll hunt you down after the event... To take you up on your offer.

Id: [0x0024EE2C]
Of course... after the event.

Id: [0x0024EE31]
I'll squish you like a bug.

Id: [0x0024EF13]
My friend, the tokens are not to be taken lightly, no! That's not enough at all!

Id: [0x0024F4C8]
HERODIANOS

Id: [0x0024F8B5]
Fine, keep your malákes tokens then.

Id: [0x0024F92C]
Ardos sent me. He says you know things.

Id: [0x0024F92D]
Nikios thought his armor was the finest in the Greek world. He could have worn Theseus's when we found it, but I was the perfect fit. Minotaur struck me right in the chest... Should have died. But Nikios...?

Id: [0x0024F92F]
Don't make Nikios' mistake: Wear Theseus's armor.

Id: [0x0024F930]
But someone stole one from me!

Id: [0x0024F931]
If you find it, you can have it, but give whoever took it a piece of my mind. [beat]And perhaps a piece of your blade.

Id: [0x0024F932]
I’ll face this mystery opponent in the arena.

Id: [0x0024F9A9]
Why won't anyone help me?

Id: [0x0024F9AE]
Misthios! Please help! I'll do anything!

Id: [0x0024F9B5]
Please, help me.

Id: [0x0024F9B6]
Calm down. Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x0024F9B8]
Raiders in the forest... My husband... He tried to fight them off.

Id: [0x0024F9BB]
Your husband should be able to fight them off.

Id: [0x0024F9C5]
I will find your husband and the bandits.

Id: [0x0024F9CA]
Did you say the forest? I thought the forests of Argos are safe.

Id: [0x0024F9CB]
They stole our food, our horse. They wanted to take me. All I can hear is their awful laughing. Such a horrible noise.

Id: [0x0024F9CD]
Laughing? And a whole group ambushed you for one horse?

Id: [0x0024F9CE]
Yes!

Id: [0x0024F9CF]
If your husband is facing the bandits alone, he won't have long to live.

Id: [0x0024F9D0]
Please. I have a child. You have to help us.

Id: [0x0024F9D4]
Please, misthios! Help save my husband from those bandits!

Id: [0x0024F9D9]
Go to the forest and save my husband!

Id: [0x0024F9DE]
You could have joined me, messenger.

Id: [0x0024F9E3]
We could have ruled the world together.

Id: [0x0024F9E8]
Die for me, my child.

Id: [0x0024F9F0]
After you saved that child, I knew. Can't help but do the right thing, can you?

Id: [0x0024F9F2]
Chrysis! You killed this man just to set a trap?

Id: [0x0024F9F5]
It's an honor to give your life to Hera's greatest priestess. He died willingly.

Id: [0x0024F9F9]
With him gone, I have room for one more on my council. It isn't too late to join us.

Id: [0x0024FA03]
You've lost your mind, Chrysis! This is madness.

Id: [0x0024FA04]
A world where a killer like you is held up as a hero... That is madness.

Id: [0x0024FA05]
This is the world you helped to make! I will unmake it.

Id: [0x0024FA07]
This stops now, Chrysis! Today you die for what you did to my family. I will avenge my brother.

Id: [0x0024FA0A]
Very well. If you wish to be an agent of chaos - if you wish to be a killer - then <i>kill</i>, child.

Id: [0x0024FA74]
Now, follow me! The entrance is way down underground.

Id: [0x0024FA75]
The water!

Id: [0x0024FA76]
What's your name?

Id: [0x002509C7]
I'm trying to hunt him down.

Id: [0x002509D9]
This is a family matter. It's best you solve it amongst yourselves.

Id: [0x002509DA]
I've heard talk of ruins outside the city, and from what the guard said, the torches were heading in that direction.

Id: [0x002509E4]
What did he accuse me of stealing?

Id: [0x002509F5]
This color looks strange. I should ask the art merchant where the artist could have got it.

Id: [0x002509F7]
There's some hair stuck in the paint. Maybe from the brush the artist used? I'd better ask Agellos.

Id: [0x002509F9]
You fool, you've doomed me and yourself! You've broken the sacred truce of Olympia!

Id: [0x002509FD]
<i>Mater</i> - Pausanias revealed himself before I was dragged out of there.

Id: [0x00250A01]
So, he <i>is</i> the Cultist King. It would be wise to deal with him as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00250A02]
I will.

Id: [0x00250A05]
It must only work at night. I should come back after dark.

Id: [0x00250A07]
Those panels... I wonder what they mean.

Id: [0x00250A0F]
It's aligned!

Id: [0x00250A16]
I think I've got it.

Id: [0x00250A1B]
This looks to be in the right position.

Id: [0x00250A1D]
If I kill her, Phaidon goes free… But that means Odessa dies, and I help the Cult…

Id: [0x00250A23]
That's it then… Now to make sure he lets Phaidon go.

Id: [0x00250A29]
Someone dropped offerings here... Looks like they were trying to carry them away behind the statue?

Id: [0x00250A30]
There's a draft here... A crack in the wall?

Id: [0x00250A34]
I received word that Hermippos is dead. Very interesting...

Id: [0x00250A38]
Eagle Bearer, I had a feeling I would see you again soon.

Id: [0x00250A40]
You're smarter than they make you out to be, Eagle Bearer.

Id: [0x00250A41]
Tell me why I shouldn't just kill you now?

Id: [0x00250AF5]
Why are you working with Sparta given all that's happened?

Id: [0x00250AF6]
Paros made an alliance with the Athenians, so they left me little choice.

Id: [0x00250AF7]
You needed support.

Id: [0x00250AF8]
A rivalry with Paros is one thing, but they turned it into a war. Their partnership with Athens was too much to weather for Naxos alone.

I should find Kallipateira's son, he should be able to help prove his mater's innocence.

Id: [0x00250B0B]
Come on, let's see what you can do.

Id: [0x00250B0F]
I must ensure Naxos has a future after I'm gone.

Id: [0x00250B10]
The only obstacle to that is Paros.

Id: [0x00250B11]
Not just Paros, the Cult as well.

Id: [0x00250B12]
You overestimate their influence, my friend.

Id: [0x00250B1B]
Where am I? What's going on?

Id: [0x00250B1C]
My friend here, Kassandra, brought you to help me with a patient, Dymas.

Id: [0x00250C40]
Pankration here! Last chance to claim your spot!

Id: [0x00250C87]
Still, the loss of my crew hurts a great deal. It's harder to prize anything greater than the people you trust.

There he is!

Id: [0x00252DB8]
I need to talk to him.

Id: [0x00252DB9]
Found him!

Id: [0x00252DBA]
I see him.

Id: [0x00252DBB]
He's over there.

Id: [0x00252DBF]
There it is!

Id: [0x00252DC0]
That's what I'm looking for.

Id: [0x00252DC1]

Id: [0x00252DC9]

Id: [0x00252E27]
I'm where I need to be.

Id: [0x00252E28]
This is it.

Id: [0x00252E29]
I'm here.

Id: [0x00252E2A]
This looks like the place.

Id: [0x00252E2B]
Here we are.

Id: [0x00252E31]
Is there something you need?

Id: [0x00252E33]
<i>Chaire</i>. Can I help you with anything?

Id: [0x00252E35]
Can I help you with something?

Id: [0x00252F30]
...And Brasidas. I should have gotten to Deimos sooner.[beat] I'm sorry, my friend.

Id: [0x00252FE2]
This imprint is shaped like the sword Deimos had at the Cultist's meeting. Was it forged in this place?

Id: [0x00253146]
Don't forget, we're a team. We'll back you up until you've finished your investigation.

I believe this staff is important. But the Templars and Assassins have found Staves before. Nikolai Tesla blew one up in Russia, if I remember correctly?

Id: [0x00253173]
Aarrrgggghhhhh

Id: [0x0025326F]
I wonder if...

Id: [0x00253291]
I tried to save you!

Id: [0x00253295]
So disappointing.

Id: [0x00253299]
This is for the lives you've destroyed!

Id: [0x00253315]
Layla, was that what we think it was? The Staff of Hermes, Kassandra... I'm sorry. There was nothing you could do, she knew it was her time.

Id: [0x0025331A]
You can't be serious. You need to rest, we have to study the staff... Layla?

Id: [0x0025331D]
Stop living in the past, sister. Your death is now.

Id: [0x0025331F]
Who trained you? <i>Mater</i>? <i>Pater</i>?

Id: [0x00253320]
You should have trained with the Cult. Would have made this fight more interesting.

Id: [0x00253322]
This is for Brasidas!

Id: [0x00253323]
And this is for Phoibe!

Id: [0x00253325]
Soon you'll be dead, and so will your precious Cult!

Id: [0x00253328]
Something's blocking this.

Id: [0x0025332C]
Hm. Won't budge.

Id: [0x00253330]
Something's in the way.

Id: [0x00253332]
You've hurt this family for the last time.

Id: [0x00253333]
[laughs]Oh, but that's where you're wrong. The hurting has only just begun.

Id: [0x0025333A]
The spear of Leonidas was wasted on you.

Id: [0x00253343]
Here, take this.

Id: [0x002535EB]
I just don’t understand. What about this... pyramid? How does it work? Why does the Cult have it?

Id: [0x002535EC]
I've been trying to figure out all of that myself. It's as much of a mystery to you as it is to me.

Id: [0x002535ED]
This pyramid has been worshipped by the Cult for decades, and we have used it to replace the Oracle of Delphi, the most trusted person in all the Greek world.

Id: [0x002535EE]
But you've seen something, too.

Id: [0x002535EF]
I don’t know how or why, but it did show me [beat]something.

Id: [0x002535F0]
What did you see?

Id: [0x002535F1]
I saw you. In the vision, you destroyed the pyramid and you destroyed the Cult... <i>I</i> saw what would come after.

Id: [0x002535F3]
After the Cult?

Id: [0x002535F4]
We will be replaced by a new kind of order - control under the reign of a philosopher king. There would be a movement away from the old gods towards rational society, built in a kingdom by the people, for the people. And I must find someone to lead them.

Id: [0x002535F5]
But I couldn’t achieve any of this with the Cult and their chaotic regime. So I let them carry out their plans, and let the time of the Cult of Kosmos come to an end on its own.

Id: [0x002535F7]
Using the people's reliance on a pantheon of dead gods would help to reshape humanity in our favor. [beat]The pyramid holds a mysterious power to see into time. But only certain people can activate it. People like Deimos, and the ones in your bloodline.

Id: [0x00254F58]
I went to see the priests first. I had to find out about my mother.

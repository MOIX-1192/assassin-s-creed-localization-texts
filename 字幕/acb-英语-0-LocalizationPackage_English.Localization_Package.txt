The oldest, and the most famous, bridge in Venice, the Rialto is the dividing line between the districts of San Marco and San Polo. The bridge is notable not only for the size of its large arch, but also for its main walkway lined with shops and stalls, which was a vibrant strolling and meeting place for the community around it.<br><br>Contrast that with today's Rialto, where crowds of tourists fight over cheap knockoffs of Venetian glass while some idiot attempts to spit off the edge of the bridge onto passing boats. Ah, modernity.

Originally founded in 421, San Giacomo is believed to be the oldest church in Venice, although the current building was constructed around 1071. <br><br>The 15th Century facade is crowned with a magnificent 24-hour celestial clock. During the Renaissance, the church was typically used by the merchants in the nearby market as a place to stop and pray during the workday. <br><br>At least, that's what they told their wives.

Built by Franciscan monks, Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari (The Frari for short) is the second largest church in Venice. Following the guidelines of St. Francis, who advocated poverty, the church has very basic exterior decoration. <br><br>It is rumoured that in the 15th Century, the Frari housed a hidden tomb, which has since collapsed.

Now that bell tower looks like a challenge!

Established sometime around 1465, the Venetian Thieves Guild, due to its illegality, had no permanent headquarters. <br><br>Although efforts were made by the magistrates to crack down on thievery, accused culprits never seemed to be around when the city guard went searching for them.

Renaissance thieves were usually wanderers who could vanish at the first sign of trouble, making it hard for guards to track them. <br><br>Black market business in Renaissance Italy was booming. Muggings in the major cities were fairly common, as were murders. Often, strollers were attacked in the dead of night, killed, robbed and then rolled into the nearest river or canal. Even if a thief merely stole, rather than killed, the penalties if caught were often unduly harsh. Torture was common. Thieves were put in stocks and sometimes even publically executed. <br><br>In order to avoid punishment, thieves often created bonds of trust amongst each other. Each was supposed to tell the rest his dirty secrets, which meant that each thief potentially held his comrades' lives in his hands.

I bet those thieves can work with you to distract the guards, and if you start a brawl, they'll probably fight with you. Just go talk to them. They'll tell you their price.

The home of Venice's most powerful merchant, Emilio Barbarigo. Work on Seta (as it is affectionately known by locals), was completed in 1450. The palazzo is a standout example of Venetian gothic architecture: dark and imposing, yet light and airy at the same time.

Originally built as a watchtower in the 9th Century, the Campanile di San Marco was later transformed into a bell tower. Each of the five bells has a special purpose: one announces the Senate, another announces midday, a third the opening and closing of the work day, the fourth council meetings, and the fifth and final bell: Executions.

The Basilica di San Marco was first built in 828 to house supposed relics of St. Mark stolen from Alexandria. The present Byzantine-style basilica was constructed in 1063. <br><br>Check out the facade. Many of the decorations were brought back from the Crusades or given as gifts from wealthy merchants. The church was considered the Doge's personal chapel; a passageway inside connects to the Palazzo Ducale next door.

Id: [0x0001BC28]
Check. That. Out. If I were you, I'd totally climb that tower.

One of the earliest examples of Renaissance architecture in Venice, this church was built for the residents of a nearby hospice by the doge buried inside, Cristoforo Moro. <br><br>Cristoforo presided over Venice's war with the Turks, until his death in 1471. He had one son, Dante Moro, who he disowned after Dante lost his position as Captain of the Venetian City Guard in 1468.

The first great basilica in Florence, Santa Maria Novella was consecrated in 1420 despite being unfinished. The famous humanist Leone Battista Alberti, designed the upper facade, completing the church in 1470. <br><br>However, Santa Maria Novella's origins extend back before the Crusades to an ancient oratory, located on the same site, with a hidden tomb underneath. As of today, the tomb has not been uncovered. <br><br>On a related note, one of my favourite quotes is located inside the basilica, written on the image of a tomb: "I was once what you are, and what I am you will become".

Intended as a grand display of wealth by Luca Pitti, the Pitti Palace was left incomplete when Luca ran out of money and died in 1472. The severe Roman-style architecture is reminiscent of the craggy stone arches of the ancient imperial aqueducts found outside Rome.

Id: [0x0001F3D1]
Completed in 1473, the Palazzo Auditore is notable for its rusticated stonework and Roman pilasters. Giovanni Auditore designed the palazzo himself, based on initial sketches by Leone Battista Alberti. <br><br>Once built, the palazzo became a fixture of the Santa Maria Novella district. Lorenzo de' Medici mentioned in a letter addressed to Giovanni, dated 1474, that he admired the facade's lack of "ostentation".

Prostitution was one of the most popular occupations for Renaissance women, whose only other options in most cases were staying with their families or living in a convent. Italian society supported prostitution, and many brothels were regulated by the government. At the end of the 15th century, cities started to pass laws against prostitution, forcing courtesans to wear specific outfits and separating them from respected society.

Id: [0x0001F4AE]
Those girls are definitely available for hire. I bet you can use them as moving cover. In fact, try sending them to tempt unwanted guards.

Date of Birth: 1438.<br>Profession: Madame of La Rosa Colta.<br><br>There isn't much information about Paola in the history books, but the Florentine archives reveal that she was orphaned at age 8 when her parents were killed at sea. Left with a choice between joining a nunnery and prostitution, she began a life on the streets. <br><br>At 16, she vanishes from the records, only to reappear at age 20 when she was arrested for murdering a city guard. On an interesting note, Giovanni Auditore represented her in court, winning the case on a self defence plea.<br><br>Released from prison, Paola went on to start her own brothel to protect many other unfortunate women of the street.

ARSENALE DI VENEZIA

Id: [0x000437E2]
First built as a naval depot for private ships, the Arsenal was rebuilt and enlarged in 1320. From that point on, it was used by the Venetian state to construct and maintain its ships. Famously, at the peak of production, shipbuilders were able to produce an entire ship in a day. The impressive front gate (the Porta Magna) went up in 1460, in the Classical revivalist style.<br><br>It looks like Silvio Barbarigo was not the first Templar to control the Arsenal. According to my research, the 1320 renovation was paid for with Templar funds and they seem to have had an established base there ever since.

SANTA MARIA DEI CARMINI

Id: [0x0004391C]
Built in the 1300s, Santa Maria dei Carmini (Carmini for short) was founded by a group of women who made their livelihood stitching monastic aprons for the monks in a nearby Carmelite monastery.<br><br>Carmelites believed so much in these aprons, or scapulars, that the Carmelite Constitution stated it was a serious fault to sleep without one and saying Mass sans scapular resulted in automatic excommunication. Why? Because in 1251, The Virgin Mary made herself known to Simon Stock of Cambridge, and she told him that those who wore a brown scapular would be granted salvation. <br><br>So, 200 years later, a group of women still huddle inside Santa Maria dei Carmini, working all their lives to manufacture salvation, distilled in the form of brown aprons.

SQUERO DI SAN TROVASO

Id: [0x00043942]
This small square is used as a boatyard to build and repair gondolas. <br><br>The chief means of transportation within Venice, gondolas are fashioned out of eight different kinds of wood (mahogany, cherry, fir, walnut, oak, elm, larch and lime) and are made of 280 pieces. <br><br>The left side of the boat is longer than the right side, allowing the gondolier to pilot the gondola from the left without it changing direction, and ensuring that intoxicated gondoliers don't accidentally hit their passengers in the face with an oar while switching sides.

Located on the waterfront, Santa Maria della Visitazione is the second church in Venice with that same name, making it easy to end up at the wrong wedding. <br><br>The church was founded in the 1400s and dedicated to St. Jerome, the patron saint of librarians and encyclopaedia writers, but then, was rededicated to the Virgin's visit with Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, perhaps because visits are usually accompanied by food and are quite simply more fun.

SCUOLA GRANDE DI SAN MARCO

Id: [0x00043B6F]
The Scuola Grande di San Marco was one of the six large charitable organizations founded in Venice to help citizens afford food, dowries, processions, marriages, burials and anything else they might need. Notably, membership was open to any citizen of Venice, not just the elite. <br><br>Citizenship status was conferred on third generation Venetians or those who had paid taxes for fifteen years, meaning that Venetians were pretty xenophobic, except when you gave them money.<br><br>The facade of the building, which was built in 1260, was destroyed in a 1485 fire, causing it to be rebuilt in its current, opulent Byzantine form.

PALAZZO DUCALE DI VENEZIA

Id: [0x00043CA3]
The Palazzo Ducale was constructed from 1309-1424, in the Gothic style, as the residence for the Doge, or, rather, his prison, since the Doge was rarely allowed to leave once elected.<br><br>The Doge was the highest ranking elder in Venice and served in his position for life. In 1172, the selection of the Doge became entrusted to a committee of 40 (the Forty), whose members were chosen by the Venetian Great Council. <br><br>Venice liked to think of itself as a Republic, meaning that the people could participate in the government. When the Doge took office he was introduced to the people with the words: “This is the Doge, if it please you.” In fact, members of the Great Council were appointed by the Forty, which in turn chose the Forty. See the problem there? <br><br>Candidates for the Great Council were selected from a microscopic pool containing only noble families and although the Doge could nominate anyone to the Council, the Forty and the Council itself had to approve the nomination. Because the general population was largely uneducated, the election rules were purposefully complicated, and the Council controlled the guards, Venice followed the historical norm: the people got screwed.

SAN ZACCARIA

Id: [0x00043CB0]
First built in the 9th Century, San Zaccaria is dedicated to the father of St. John the Baptist, Zechariah, who is supposedly buried there. Other locations in which St. Zechariah is supposedly buried: the Gandzasar Monastery in Nagorno Karabakh, Yad Avshalom, the Great Mosque of Aleppo and the Valley of Jehoshaphat.<br><br>San Zaccaria burned down in 1105, killing more than a 100 nuns. The church was rebuilt around 1170 and then later redone with a mixture of Gothic and Renaissance styles. <br><br>Ironically, in the Renaissance, it flourished as the nunnery of choice for the daughters of the noblest families in Venice, who obviously didn't know the building's history.

First built in the 7th Century, San Pietro di Castello was the seat of the Bishop of Venice. Notice how far away San Pietro di Castello is from the Palazzo Ducale? That distance is not accidental, the Venetian Doges wanted to remain independent from the church.<br><br>Although San Pietro di Castello itself is nothing remarkable, the tower is the first to be cloaked in Istrian stone from the quarries outside Venice, the same white stone that covers the Palazzo Ducale.

The district of San Polo is home to the famous Rialto Bridge and Venice's oldest church, San Giacomo di Rialto, which dates from the 5th Century. It also contains Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, one of the largest churches in Venice. <br><br>Merchants flock to San Polo to sell their wares, small wonder the palazzo of Venice's most powerful 15th Century merchant, Emilio Barbarigo, is located here.

TORRE DELL'OROLOGIO

Id: [0x000441CD]
Constructed in the late 15th Century as a display of Venice’s wealth, the Torre dell’Orologio displays the time of day, the current phase of the moon, and for those of us who believe that all of human behaviour is governed by little shapes in the stars, the dominant sign of the Zodiac. <br><br>According to legend, the designers of the clock face were blinded once their work was complete, so they could never duplicate it elsewhere. While this is probably bollocks, the designers did live inside the clock tower for the rest of their lives to maintain it. <br><br>The Torre dell’Orologio ended up serving one very important practical purpose; it was used by sailors in the nearby harbour to time their departures with the tides.

SANTA TRINITA

Id: [0x000441CF]
Constructed over an existing church in 1258, Santa Trinita (Holy Trinity) is known for its Sassetti chapel, which is decorated with frescos of the life of Saint Francis by Domenico Ghirlandaio, a painter most famous for his brief role as one of Michelangelo’s teachers. <br><br>Santa Trinita was the mother church of the Vallumbrosan order of monks, a very serious group that strictly enforced both poverty and silence, for life. <br><br>Despite the beauty of the Santa Trinita frescos, very few Vallumbrosan monks are likely to have seen them, on account of the fact that the monks received beatings for going outside their monasteries.

SANTA CROCE

The largest Franciscan church in the world, the Basilica di Santa Croce contains frescos by Giotto and a chapel in the cloister designed by Filippo Brunelleschi that is considered one of the masterpieces of Renaissance architecture. <br><br>According to St. Francis and the Franciscans' reading of the Bible, Christ told his followers to take on a vow of poverty: "And he said to them: Take nothing for your journey; neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats". So, how did a sect of Catholicism that held a vow of poverty as one of its core values own such a posh church? <br><br>Well, in 1322, the Pope declared that the Franciscans' vow of poverty was illegal, that Christ had, in fact, owned property and wanted his followers to own property. This meant, of course, that the Franciscans were forced to collect money and land which would in turn go to the Pope, proving that Biblical interpretation can be surprisingly profitable (especially if you're the Pope).

BOTTEGA DI LEONARDO A VENEZIA

Id: [0x000445F6]
During his brief stay in Venice, Leonardo da Vinci was a paid military engineer for the Venetian army, and claimed to be working on a painting of the famous Isabella d'Este, of whom he had made a cartoon while visiting Mantua. Despite promising her repeatedly that he was hard at work, no painting ever materialized.<br><br>Although many history books claim Leonardo only visited Venice once, it seems that he used his workshop there as a sort of secret retreat, returning to it repeatedly during his life.

SANTI GIOVANNI E PAOLO

Id: [0x000445F8]
One of the largest churches in Venice, Santi Giovanni e Paolo was built after Doge Jacopo Tiepolo had a dream about white birds flying over the site. He donated the land on which the church was built in 1246 to the Dominicans. The current Italian Gothic church was completed in 1430.<br><br>On a stranger note, the church claims to contain the foot of Saint Catherine of Sienna. Born in Siena in 1347, as the last of 25 children, Catherine became an important ambassador for the Pope, whom she liked to call "Daddy".<br><br>Ironically, the most startling incident in her life happened after her death, when her followers in Siena attempted to steal her body from Rome. Unable to get the body out of the city, they lovingly cut off her head and put it in a sack. <br><br>When the guards decided to search the sack, her followers prayed to Catherine. The guards saw rose petals inside the sack instead of the head, and let the group go to Siena without taking the bloody sack away from them. And that's why she's a saint.

Date of Birth: 1431.<br>Profession: Pope, Leader of the Italian Templars.<br><br>After his failure to return with a powerful weapon from the Vault beneath the Vatican, Rodrigo seems to have been plagued by bad omens.<br><br>In June of 1500, a steeple from the roof of St. Peters fell, dislodging an iron beam that came clattering down a few feet from the Pope as he walked through the Basilica. The next day, a room in the Vatican collapsed around him. Everyone else in the room was killed, only a piece of canopy wedged above the Pope saved his life. Then, a few weeks later, he ended up in bed with a severe fever. Finally, at the end of the year, while hunting, he was charged by a stag. <br><br>After each of these incidents, Rodrigo seems to have left more and more to Cesare, content to collect indulgences to help fund the Captain General's military campaign and to kill off cardinals if the florins weren't coming fast enough to restock the Papal treasury. He also seemed to take great delight in the women of Rome, engaging in several "bodily feasts" alongside his daughter, Lucrezia.<br><br>In July of 1503, after the death of Juan Borgia the Elder, a journal entry made by the new Papal secretary suggests that a worried Rodrigo moved "a strange Apple" he had kept inside a locked desk out of the Castello. <br><br>Curiouser and curiouser.

SANTA MARIA DEL FIORE

Id: [0x000447B8]
One of Italy's largest churches, and the largest landmark in Florence, Santa Maria del Fiore is considered by many to be the first masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. <br><br>Although the church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296, the dome was not started until the beginning of the 15th century. With Cambio long dead, none of the architects at that time had any idea how to construct such an enormous structure, since the use of buttresses was forbidden in Florence and mortar took several days to set. <br><br>But all was not lost. In an amazing comeback story, Filippo Brunelleschi, an architect who had been defeated in an earlier bid to design the Baptistery doors, won the competition to build the dome. He beat out Lorenzo Ghiberti, the same artist he had lost to before.<br><br>Brunelleschi invented machines to hoist the bricks needed for the dome up to the workers and was able to construct the entire dome without using centring (a support structure to hold the dome in place while bricks were laid). Containing over 4 million bricks, the dome was completed in 1436. <br><br>The lantern was added after Brunelleschi's death in 1446, and supposedly contains holy relics. However, there were several rumours that, in fact, an entire tomb of unknown origin is located inside.

PALAZZO DELLA SIGNORIA

Id: [0x000447C4]
Arnolfo di Cambio designed the Palazzo della Signoria (also known as the Palazzo Vecchio) in 1299, for the rulers of Florence, the Signoria. <br><br>The Signoria was made up of nine members (or Priori) selected by the city's guilds, two from each district, and a Gonfalonier of Justice. Members were supposed to be chosen by lot, but once the Medici family took power, only their friends seemed to end up in the drawing. Government by the people, right?<br><br>Interesting fact: The tower in front is off-centre because it was incorporated into the Palazzo from an earlier structure. It contains two small cells, one of which was used to imprison Cosimo de' Medici.

SAN LORENZO

Id: [0x000447C6]
The church in which all the Medici went to die, San Lorenzo claims to be the oldest in Florence. It was consecrated in 393, while still outside the city walls. <br><br>Michelangelo designed the inner facade, while Filippo Brunelleschi, the creator of Santa Maria del Fiore's dome, designed the layout. He died before the church was finished and several of his designs were subsequently modified. <br><br>Containing nearly fifty tombs, the Medici crypt was intended to house the Holy Sepulchre containing the body of Christ at its centre. However, attempts to buy it and, then, to steal it from Jerusalem failed, proving that bankers can buy a lot of things, but not integrity.

Built between 1376 and 1382 by Benci de Cione and Simone di Francesco Talenti, the Loggia dei Lanzi was created to provide a covering for the swearing-in of the members of the Signoria, the rulers of Florence.<br><br>In the 16th century, the Medici had a private balcony constructed on top, making it clear to the city of Florence who was really in charge.

GIOTTO'S CAMPANILE

Id: [0x000447CE]
Begun by Giotto di Bondone (the famous architect and painter) in 1334, this famous gothic bell tower was incomplete when Giotto died. Andrea Pisano took over and then, in 1348, was felled by the Black Death. <br><br>In 1359, the tower was completed by Francesco Talenti, who deviated from Giotto's plan in his design of the upper three floors. He enlarged each floor to match the previous according to perspective, so, when seen from below, all three floors seem to be exactly the same size.<br><br>The tower is clad with white marble from Carrara, red marble from Siena and green marble from Prato. It takes exactly 414 steps to reach the top, perhaps predicting Charles Messier's discovery of the Whirlpool Galaxy exactly 414 years later. Or perhaps not.

PALAZZO MEDICI

Id: [0x00044892]
Completed in 1455 by Cosimi de' Medici's live-in architect Michelozzo di Bartolomeo Michelozzi, the Palazzo Medici was constructed as the private residence of the Medici family. It was designed according to the values of humanism, the dominant ideology of the Renaissance, which attempts to engage the viewer with structures built on a more human scale. <br><br>At least, that's the theoretical ideology of the palazzo, but, the effect goes something more like this: the outside is foreboding and keeps people out. If the facade could talk, it seems to be saying: "Get back! You do not belong here! You are not important enough to enter!" <br><br>In contrast, the interior courtyard, which only the Medici and their guests saw, has none of the exterior's hard edges, it's full of luscious, curving rounded arches, like a wedding cake. It says: "You've arrived, welcome to paradise!" <br><br>In fact, Cosimo both approved the courtyard and rejected an earlier architectural plan by Brunelleschi that would have led to a more open facade. He wanted a Medici fortress inside Florence.

SANTO SPIRITO

Id: [0x00044945]
Built on top of the ruins of an Augustinian Convent that burned down in 1471, Santo Spirito was designed by Brunelleschi, the same bloke who did the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore and San Lorenzo. As with San Lorenzo, he died before Santo Spirito was finished. <br><br>The church was completed as per his specifications except for the facade, which was left blank, presumably when the Pope decided to reallocate funds for a country house. <br><br>Michelangelo lived in Santo Spirito when he was 17, after Lorenzo de' Medici died. While there, he studied the corpses from the convent's hospital and sculpted a naked crucifix that shows off his fascination with the male form, as does, you know, David, the Sistine Chapel ceiling, most of his sculptures and almost anything he ever touched.

OSPEDALE DEGLI INNOCENTI

Id: [0x00044AF7]
Designed by Filippo Brunelleschi and opened in 1445, the Ospedale degli Innocenti (Hospital of the Innocents) was an orphanage for unwanted babies. Apparently, the Florentines were a feisty bunch, since it was the first of its kind in Europe. <br><br>Babies were typically abandoned in a basin in the front, although later transactions were facilitated by the introduction of a rotating horizontal wheel which moved infants into the building without the parents being seen.<br><br>Some parents weren't just ejecting their love child, they were making money off them. Many a mother abandoned her baby in order to be hired by the Ospedale as a wet nurse, so she could be paid to feed her own child.<br><br>Boys were tutored in various professions by the Ospedale's staff, while girls were usually trained to become nuns or wives.

BOTTEGA DI LEONARDO A FIRENZE

Id: [0x00044AFE]
Leonardo da Vinci opened his own studio after completing his apprenticeship to Verrocchio, one of the most successful Florentine artists of the day. <br><br>Between 1476 and 1481, Leonardo probably continued to collaborate with Verrocchio, although no one is quite sure what he was working on. In 1481, he was given his first commission by the monks of San Donato a Scopeto, to paint The Adoration of the Magi. <br><br>In true da Vinci style, he began the painting, but never finished it.

ANTICO TEATRO ROMANO

Id: [0x00044B01]
Inspired by Greek theatres, which had a similar structure, ruins of Ancient Roman theatres can be found throughout the territories once ruled by the Empire. <br><br>Typical Roman theatres were constructed of concrete, a material no longer used in Renaissance Italy because the recipe had been lost. Their semicircular design created superior acoustics, allowing spectators to hear the plays, speeches, or choral events performed on stage.<br><br>Notice the lack of marble? Renaissance Italians practiced a rudimentary form of recycling when dealing with Roman structures: any marble that could be found was ripped off the buildings to be reused for free.

TORRE ROGNOSA

Id: [0x00044B11]
Connected to the 13th Century Palazzo Vecchio del Podestà, the Torre Rognosa rises 51 meters above San Gimignano. <br><br>Podestà (Power in English) was the title given to the appointed head of many Italian cities. The Palazzo Vecchio was the residence of the Podestà of San Gimignano for about 100 years, until, in 1337, he moved across the square into the Palazzo Comunale. <br><br>Why would the Podestà simply abandon tradition like that? Perhaps because the Palazzo Comunale has the largest tower in San Gimignano. <br><br>Tower Envy: do not underestimate it as a force for change.

TORRE GROSSA

Id: [0x00044B13]
Rising 54 meters above San Gimignano, the city's largest tower, the Torre Grossa, lives up to its name. Unlike some of the other towers, it even has a bell inside it. Construction of the Torre Grossa began in 1300 and finished in 1311.

TORRI DEI SALVUCCI

Id: [0x00044B15]
In a city famous for its towers, the Salvucci family, in a display of 13th Century might, erected not one but two. And not only did they erect two, they built them to be taller than the ruler of San Gimigniano's (the Podestà's) tower, despite a law made in 1255 that prohibited such an act of blatant brick and mortar-style aggression.<br><br>Outraged, the Podestà forced the towers to be cut down until they were smaller than his.

PALAZZO COMUNALE

Id: [0x00044B17]
Palazzo Comunale, San Gimignano's town hall, was built as the seat of the municipal government in 1288. <br><br>As befits the City of Towers, one of the council's earliest acts inside their new home was to construct the Torre Grossa on top. The Podestà took up residence at the Palazzo Comunale in 1337.

The centre of Florentine business, the Mercato Vecchio served all the shopping needs of the city.

SANTA MARIA ASSUNTA

Referred to as the Duomo by locals, even though it doesn’t deserve the title because the town has no bishop, Santa Maria Assunta was built in the 12th Century.

SAN GIMIGNANO

Id: [0x00044BFD]
Named after Saint Geminianus, who supposedly conjured up a dense fog to save the city of Modena from Attila the Hun, San Gimignano was founded in the 3rd Century. The city grew from the 10th Century onward as a stopping point along the pilgrimage route to Rome. <br><br>In 1199, once its citizens grew wealthy, San Gimignano separated from the bishops of Volterra and became self-governing. The city’s distinctive towers were created as its wealthy citizens competed to display how much money was actually in their pockets. In its heyday, the city had 72 towers. <br><br>But the plague of 1348 decimated San Gimignano. Without money for upkeep, the town started to fall apart. The council appealed to Florence, and Florence took control.

CASTEL SANT'ANGELO

Id: [0x00044BFF]
Rodrigo Borgia (a.k.a. Pope Alexander VI) has his apartments in the Castel Sant'Angelo. <br><br>Built between 135 and 139, as the tomb of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, the Castel was designed to be slightly larger than the Mausoleum of Augustus, because, as this database has shown time and again, size does matter. <br><br>The building was converted into a military fortress in 401 and was promptly sacked by Visigoth looters in 410, who scattered Hadrian's ashes everywhere. What was left was recycled, i.e. stolen by the Vatican. <br><br>In the 14th century, the tomb was converted into a castle for the popes and connected to St. Peter's via a covered passage called the Passetto di Borgo. Reflecting the delightfully sadistic side of Renaissance papal rule, the castle contained both sumptuous apartments and a prison. Giordano Bruno, the famous scientist and Hermeticist, was held there for six years. Executions were carried out in the small interior courtyard for the Pope's enjoyment.

MONTERIGGIONI

Id: [0x00044C01]
Built in the 13th century by the overlords of Siena, Monteriggioni was actively involved in the defence of Tuscany against Florentine attempts to gain more territory. At the front of this conflict was the Auditore family, who became the city's rulers and protectors. It was the Auditore who constructed Monteriggioni's famous walls, which can still be seen today. <br><br>Although standing in opposition to Florentine desires, the Auditore had cordial relations with the Medici family, largely due to their collective Florentine roots.<br><br>Monteriggioni successfully withstood attacks from Florence, until in 1554, the city was betrayed. Giovannino Zeti, the keeper of the garrison and a Florentine exile, was allowed to return to Florence in exchange for the keys to the city. <br><br>Extraordinarily, the Auditore were allowed to continue their rule of Monteriggioni under Florentine leadership, showing that the Medici do not forget their friends.

CASA DI VESPUCCI

Id: [0x00044C0A]
Built by a distant great-great uncle of the famous Amerigo Vespucci in 1350, the relatively unpresumptuous Vespucci residence is notable for displaying the first painted facade in Florence, a style that was later done to death in the Oltrarno district.

VILLA AUDITORE

Id: [0x00044C0D]
Constructed in 1290, the Villa Auditore is an important medieval predecessor to early Renaissance architecture. The Villa's wonderful symmetry and ordered geometry were a revelation for its time. <br><br>After a Florentine attack in 1320 left the facade damaged, Domenico Auditore, Ezio Auditore's great-grandfather, purchased the Villa. Although he publically admitted to a renovation of the facade and the addition of a painting gallery, he orchestrated a complete restructuring of the interior in secret, designing his home to double as a fortress and training ground, looking out both over the city that it protects and the Tuscan plains. <br><br>Domenico was more than just an architect and a warrior; he was also a skilled engineer. Recently discovered hidden compartments and rooms with mechanisms blocking entry are several unique features of the building that make it a technological marvel as well as an architectural one.

TORRE DEL DIAVOLO

Id: [0x00044C0F]
Probably built for medieval defence, the Torre del Diavolo once had a walkway at its summit. The wooden spikes around the top held the boards of the walkway in place. <br><br>Depending upon who you ask, the name (the Devil's Tower) comes from either the fact that lighting once struck the tower, or that the original owner left on a trip, only to come back and find it slightly higher than when he left.

LA ROSA DELLA VIRTÙ

Id: [0x00044C15]
Located at the crossroads where sex and religion collide, La Rosa della Virtù (The Rose of Virtue) was run entirely by former nuns. The Pope repeatedly attempted to force the Venetian Council to shut down the brothel, but it remained open until a fire in 1516 consumed it. <br><br>Although the Church tried to claim divine intervention, jurists found the fire to have been set by a disgruntled bishop who wanted to lie with one of the girls for free. Act of God indeed.

VILLA SALVIATI

Id: [0x00044C17]
Made wealthy through his connections to the Pope, Archbishop Francesco Salviati purchased this Tuscan villa in 1475 in anticipation of becoming archbishop of Florence. He spent the next few years having it renovated in the Tuscan style, while plotting with the Pazzi family to invade Florence. Sadly, this left him very little time to enjoy it before his inevitable demise. <br><br>After the conspiracy went south, archival documents indicate that Salviati swapped his archbishop outfit with one of the residents of Florence, who was then lynched in his place, while he escaped to his villa.

CAPPELLA SISTINA

Id: [0x00044C19]
Inspired by the architecture of Solomon's Temple, the Sistine Chapel is the most famous room in the Apostolic Palace (the Pope's Vatican residence). The Chapel's famous ceiling frescos were only begun in 1508, so no climbing across the finger of God, but the wall paintings that line the chapel painted by Pietro Perugino, Sandro Botticelli and Domenico Ghirlandaio, among others, are an ample consolation prize.<br><br>As the Pope's personal chapel, mass is frequently held inside, as are the Papal Conclaves, which occur after the Pope's death. The cardinals are locked inside the chapel and are not permitted to leave until a new Pope is elected. Only through smoke signals, sent up a chimney to announce the new Pope, can they escape. <br><br>And worst of all horrors, no cardinals (unless ill) can be attended inside by more than one servant. That's just cruel!

BASILICA DI SAN PIETRO

Id: [0x00044C1F]
The original Saint Peter's Basilica, built in 326, as opposed to the epic basilica that exists today, was constructed in the form of a Latin cross. An atrium, called the Garden of Paradise, stood at the entrance, beckoning followers through the main doorways of the church. <br><br>Unlike pagan temples, which were lavishly decorated, the facade of Saint Peter's was plain. Thankfully, Catholicism got over all that when they made the new Saint Peter's. Of course, the downside was that the religion became incredibly corrupt, but, hey, beauty has to come at a price.<br><br>The Basilica was built on top of the old Circus of Nero, but before you start pulling out your popcorn and cotton candy, this wasn't a modern circus. The Roman crucifixions of Christians was the main act. Saint Peter, among many others, was hung up to die there. The Basilica was built on top of this anti-Christian site, as almost an intentional modification of history by Emperor Constantine, because if it no longer exists, it never happened, right?

Id: [0x00044C20]
Venetian naval strategy involved maintaining a steady chain of bases along their trade routes to the East, ensuring that its merchants were able to get there and back without being attacked by pirates or Venice's enemies, the Turks. <br><br>By the end of the 15th Century, Venice's fleet was occupied trying to force Charles VIII of France out of Italy, at which point, Turkish forces struck without warning. Venice was soundly defeated, losing its Greek outposts. Following that, the Turks managed to invade Venetian territory in Northern Italy. Although Venice was able to keep most of its territory, from that point forward, it would never again be a great naval power.

PONTE VECCHIO

Id: [0x00044C24]
This famous bridge spans the Arno at it narrowest point. The original version was presumably constructed by the Romans, but the first written records only appear in 996. <br><br>Two previous incarnations of the bridge were swept away in floods before the present structure was built in 1345. A tower was built at the southeast corner to defend it.<br><br>The bridge consists of three segmental arches. It has always had shops lining the central passageway, a feature which seems extraordinary now but was common during the Renaissance. <br><br>At first, butchers took up residence there, but over time they were pushed out by jewellers, souvenir shops and creepy teenagers chaining locks to the bridge's railing and throwing the keys into the river in a bid for eternal love, not realizing that the locks will be cut off later that day by disgruntled polizia. <br><br>Everlasting, indeed.

ART MERCHANTS

Id: [0x00044C5A]
The shops of Renaissance artists were usually small, and dealt mainly in religious decorations for churches or homes. Artists were not considered visionaries as they are today, but were treated merely as craftsmen, just like carpenters and blacksmiths. The production of art was usually cooperative. <br><br>The head of the shop was the master, who received commissions and oversaw the assembly of the painting. He was expected to be a businessman and turn a profit, usually creating copies of whatever religious paintings were in vogue at the time.<br><br>If you take a close look at the holy scenes most artists were forced to paint, the great works attempt to overcome their subject matter to express intangible truths about emotion, life and love.

Diagrams of the human body and the printing press influenced Renaissance medicine greatly, which had in turn been influenced by Arabic medicine during the Middle Ages. <br><br>By the 15th century, science had already begun its slow climb toward becoming more relevant than spirituality in the field of healthcare. However, many people stubbornly clung to old ways, visiting local mystics instead of doctors. <br><br>After the plague ravaged Europe in 1350, many doctors dressed in special plague gear to treat patients. To prevent contamination, they wore a cape coated in wax, and a primitive gas mask in the shape of a beak.

JUBILEE PERFORMERS

Id: [0x00044D3F]
Jubilee was supposed to be a year of celebration every 100 years in which sins and debt were forgiven. In practice, Jubilees were scheduled every 25 years in order to extort money from pilgrims and the whole thing became a devious obstacle course. Four basilicas needed to be visited in order to be forgiven. Simple, right? Wrong. Romans had to make thirty visits to the four basilicas, foreigners fifteen visits. The hapless pilgrims needed to walk through a holy door in each basilica, each of which was unwalled by the Pope or other cardinals using a silver hammer during different days. As the wall in each door collapsed, it injured the clamouring crowd around it, who, undeterred, fought for pieces of the wall. Several hundred pilgrims were trampled to death moving between churches in 1450. <br><br>The populace was so traumatized by the insanity of the events unfolding, that performers stayed in the city for several years afterward to help ease Jubilee withdrawal.

CARAVAN TRAVEL

Id: [0x00044D51]
Travel in the Renaissance was not the disgusting ordeal it is today. Instead, it was merely terrifying. The countryside was filled with bandits, causing most travellers to move in armed groups called caravans. Anxious voyagers usually sewed valuables and gold into the soles of their shoes or the lining of their jackets. <br><br>Guides called Vetturini were sometimes hired to help plot the route of the caravans and book rooms at local inns, but those carriers were often working with the bandits, just like travel agents today.

Date of Birth: 1472.<br>Profession: Exiled Ruler of Florence, Noble.<br><br>The oldest son of Lorenzo de' Medici, Piero is primarily known in history circles as a colossal fuck up. Piero the Unfortunate (yup, that's his nickname) took over as leader of Florence in 1492, and failed to keep Charles VIII of France from marching into Italy to reclaim Naples in 1494. Then, when Charles demanded control over Tuscany, Piero surrendered Florence's fortresses without a fight. <br><br>Outraged, and under the influence of Savonarola, the Florentines chased Piero out of Florence and sacked the Palazzo Medici. Piero hid out in Venice for a couple years. Then, true to form, he was drowned in the Garigliano River while fleeing from battle in 1503.

ANTONIO

Id: [0x00044F3D]
Date of Birth: 1443.<br>Profession: Leader of the Gilda dei Ladri di Venezia (Venetian Thieves Guild).<br><br>Antonio was born at the very bottom of Venetian society. Records indicate his father was a cobbler while his mother was a live-in maid for the Bellini family. <br><br>Teaching himself to read and write between apprenticeship sessions with his father, Antonio applied to the University of Padua, but was denied due to his low social rank. Documents found in several Italian archives indicate he applied to other schools around Italy as well, and was denied at all of them. Around 1465, he drops out of the record books, only to re-emerge four years later in connection with a robbery of a notable Venetian estate that happened to be owned by the rector of the University of Padua. <br><br>In a statement recorded by the city guard, before Antonio mysteriously escaped from prison, he said: "Hard work is not enough to gain superiority in Venetian society. If one truly wants more, one has to take it!"

ANNETTA

Id: [0x00044F63]
Date of Birth: 1457.<br>Profession: Servant.<br><br>The Auditore family's live-in servant, Annetta had one of the few respectable jobs allowed lower-class Renaissance women. Rich families seldom had more than one or two servants. Most were young, sometimes children. Many hoped their masters would help raise their standing, but, usually, turnover was rapid. <br><br>Ultimately, very little is known about Annetta's life. She passed on without making a mark on history.

Date of Birth: 1454.<br>Profession: Scholar, Poet.<br><br>Somewhat of a prodigy, Poliziano learned Latin and Greek at age 10, and by 18 had already become a published author. Lorenzo de' Medici hired him to act as the tutor for his children and made sure he received a post at the Studio Fiorentino. <br><br>Unfortunately, Poliziano must not have been everyone's favourite instructor. He died of arsenic poisoning in 1494, probably murdered by Piero de' Medici, his former student.

LORENZO DE'MEDICI

Id: [0x00044F68]
Date of Birth: 1449.<br>Profession: Ruler of Florence.<br><br>Simultaneously keeping the dream of the Florentine Republic alive while leaving the people with very little legitimate power, Lorenzo de' Medici deftly ruled Renaissance Florence during its Golden Age.<br><br>Lorenzo's grandfather, Cosimo, built the Medici Bank, creating one of the most powerful financial institutions in Europe and becoming fabulously rich in the process. <br><br>Considered the smartest of Cosimo's grandchildren, Lorenzo was already being sent on diplomatic missions as a child. Although his father was inept and sickly, his mother was a poet. She introduced Lorenzo to many of the prominent artists of the day, instilling in him a love of art and culture. <br><br>In 1469, when he was only twenty, Lorenzo became the head of the Medici family, at which point he quickly gained control of the Florentine government through friends in the city council, payoffs, strategic marriages and threats. But Florence prospered with Lorenzo as its puppeteer. A peace was made between the warring states of Italy and several masterpieces of Renaissance art by the likes of Botticelli and Michelangelo were made under his care. <br><br>Ultimately, Lorenzo was happier writing poetry and shadow governing than directing his family's bank. During his lifetime, several branches of the bank collapsed and the Medici assets were wasted on frivolities such as jousting tournaments. <br><br>Lorenzo died in 1492. Nearly broke, he was unable to prevent the popular backlash against his rich lifestyle and the mad monk Savonarola's rise to power.

MERCENARIES

Id: [0x00044F72]
Mercenaries were highly mobile in Renaissance Italy, moving from contract to contract. Professional captains called Condottieri, usually paid for by cities, recruited men for a fixed amount of time. Many of the for-hire soldiers who served in Italy weren't even Italian, coming from places like Germany, Switzerland and Hungary. <br><br>In their perpetual struggle to dominate Italy, the Italian states hired mercenaries to wage war against their Italian neighbours, and the soldiers, many of whom had no code of honour, would often rape and sack freely. <br><br>When the state that was bankrolling them ran out of money, the soldiers would disband, frequently to be hired to destroy the very city they had just fought to defend.<br><br>Some mercenaries were honourable, fighting for a cause they believed in, but men such as these were few and far between. Where they existed, however, they were much sought after.

CLAUDIA AUDITORE

Id: [0x00044F77]
Date of Birth: 1461.<br>Profession: Noble.<br><br>The third child of Giovanni and Maria Auditore, and the first girl in the family, Claudia lived a privileged childhood in Florence high society. After the murder of Giovanni and her two brothers, all that changed. Claudia, Ezio and Maria fled to Monteriggioni and the safety of their uncle Mario’s Villa. <br><br>Claudia remained in the Villa, caring for her nearly-comatose mother while Ezio set off to avenge the murders. A record book recovered from by archaeologists reveals a relatively unexciting existence. Between months spent managing the Villa’s finances, brief periods of activity were supplied by Ezio’s visits and the renovations she was able to carry out with the money brought back from his travels. <br><br>Under her care, the town blossomed, ushering in a new era of prosperity for Monteriggioni. Claudia, however, remained cut off from the world she loved. “To hear of Ezio’s adventures only reminds me of my own lack thereof. This is not the life I dreamed of as a child. Ezio does not understand.  He treats me so delicately, I despair of ever emerging from this prison”, she writes in one particularly poignant letter, dated July, 1495.

PETRUCCIO AUDITORE

Id: [0x00044FE1]
Date of Birth: 1463.<br>Profession: Student, Noble.<br><br>The youngest of the Auditore children, Petruccio was described as "having a weak constitution" by Giovanni Auditore in a letter to Lorenzo de' Medici soon after the boy's birth. <br><br>Apparently, he didn't improve with time. Petruccio was pulled from school due to illness when he was 12 and, according to records from the family doctor, was confined to bed. No other data exists after that, so it is probable that he eventually succumbed to his illness.

EZIO AUDITORE

Id: [0x00044FEB]
Date of Birth: 1459.<br>Profession: Assassin.<br><br>Well, this experience has been quite the education. Although there's nothing in the history books following Ezio's disappearance from Florence as a teenager after the execution of his father and brothers, we now know that he fled with his mother Maria and sister Claudia to his Uncle Mario's Tuscan Villa. <br><br>Trained there as an Assassin, he prepared to hunt down the Templars, the men behind the execution. And hunt them he did, killing them one by one until he reached their leader, Rodrigo Borgia. <br><br>With the help of his uncle, and the other Assassins, he discovered Rodrigo's plan to open an ancient vault beneath the Vatican supposedly leading to God himself. Ezio defeated Rodrigo, entered the Vault alone, and communed with a projection of Minerva, a member of an ancient race that existed before humans. <br><br>This all sounds very far-fetched when I write it out like that, now doesn't it? Fortunately, we have the Animus records to prove it, so we didn't dream it or anything. Unless we're all in a dream right now...

However, the bank logs indicate he mostly dicked around rather than actually working. <br><br>One entry goes into detail. On September 17, 1475, a bag of gold florins went missing: "After panic struck the bank, the elder Auditore approached Francesco Sassetti, and with a smile revealed the location of the bag, which had been hidden on the rooftop! If he weren't the son of Giovanni Auditore, I'd speak to Lorenzo de' Medici and have him put in the stocks!" <br><br>Federico was removed from the bank's payroll shortly after his 20th birthday, when he was hanged until dead alongside his father and brother by Uberto Alberti, a member of the Templars led by Rodrigo Borgia.

I have spent days with the artifact now. Or has it been weeks? Months? I can no longer be certain…<br><br>The others come from time to time - offering food or distraction. They say I should separate myself from these studies… Malik has even suggested I abandon them entirely. But I am not yet ready to turn away. This Apple of Eden will be understood. It must be… <br><br>Is it a weapon? Is it a catalogue? Is it somehow both? "He who increaseth knowledge, increaseth sorrow…" The philosophy of such a statement I can understand… But for it to be true - literally true? A society that waged wars with ideas and information in place of steel and swords…<br><br>Its function is simple. Elementary, even. Dominion. Control. But the process… the methods and means it employs… THESE are fascinating. Those subjected to its glow are promised all that they desire. It asks only one thing in return: complete and total obedience. And who can truly refuse? It is temptation incarnate.<br><br>I remember my own moment of weakness when confronted by Al Mualim, my confidence shaken by his words. He, who had been like a father, was now revealed to be my greatest enemy. Just the briefest flicker of doubt was all he needed to creep into my mind. But I vanquished his phantoms - restored my self confidence - and sent him from this world. I freed myself. But now I wonder… Did I really? For here I sit - desperate to understand that which I swore to destroy.<br><br>This is why: The Apple has a tale to tell. I sense the flickers of something - great and dangerous… We are all at risk. It is my duty to do something about it. I must not - cannot - turn away until I've found the truth.

What follows are the three great ironies of the Assassin Order: (1) Here we seek to promote peace, but murder is our means. (2) Here we seek to open the minds of men, but require obedience to a master and set of rules. (3) Here we seek to reveal the danger of blind faith, yet we are practitioners ourselves. <br><br>I have no satisfactory answer to these charges, only possibilities… Do we bend the rules in service to a greater good? And if we do, what does it say of us? That we are liars? That we are frauds? That we are weak? Every moment is spent wrestling with these contradictions and in spite of all the years I've had to reflect, still I can find no suitable answer… And I fear that one may not exist.<br><br>Nothing is true. Everything is permitted. Does our creed provide the answer, then? That one may be two things - opposite in every way - simultaneously? And why not? Am I not proof? We of noble intentions, possessed of barbaric means? We who celebrate the sanctity of life and then promptly take it from those we deem our enemies?

Robert de Sable may be dead, but his brotherhood survives. Though less conspicuous in appearance, I fear they remain a threat. Where once they proudly walked the streets - making for easier targets - now they retreat into the shadows. It grows difficult to track them. What wicked things will they weave in the darkness? Our work will be all the more complicated for it. Already there are rumors of a movement on Cyprus. I will have to investigate…<br><br>It's made me realize that our tactics, too, must change. It means an end to our fortresses. To our penchant for spectacular displays of public assassinations. We must weave our webs quietly. And we must do so differently than we have in the past.<br><br>Though I ask my brothers now to abandon their rituals, I do not ask that they abandon the creed. THIS is what makes us assassins. Not the removal of a finger. Not a false promise of paradise. Not the prohibition of poison. Our duty is to the people, not to custom. If we must sneak, we shall sneak. If we must use poison, we shall use poison. If our blades can be used without removing fingers, we shall not demand they be taken. And we shall not manipulate our initiates with lies and parlor tricks. We shall speak plainly and honestly. We shall be made anew…

GIOVANNI AUDITORE

Id: [0x00045023]
Date of Birth: 1436.<br>Profession: Banker, Advisor, Noble.<br> <br>Giovanni Auditore was one of the pivotal figures in 15th Century Florentine banking. In charge of overseeing the Medici bank branches across Italy, he kept the Medici machine running while Lorenzo was busy with the government. Extending his reach out into the international operation, it was Giovanni who first noticed the problems with the Lyon bank, causing him to alert Francesco Sassetti, which saved the branch.<br> <br>Such great talent was well rewarded by Il Magnifico. Giovanni developed a close friendship with Lorenzo de' Medici, becoming one of his closest advisors. Successful negotiations to secure the Pope's support of the Medici bank in 1471 were carried out by Giovanni. <br> <br>Relieved and grateful, Lorenzo paid for Giovanni's palazzo, as a gift.

I leave to pick up the eggs and meat from the market and will be back in time to open the bakery as the sun strikes the top of the courtyard. How privileged a life we lead. It is hard to remember on such a day that what is given may also be taken away."<br> <br>These are the final lines of Maria's diaries. <br><br>Born into the powerful banking family, the Mozzi, Maria is one of the most famous historical sources of the time period due to her multi-volume diary, which has been translated by several notable scholars and is on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. <br><br>Now, thanks to the Animus, we know why her diaries ceased. After her husband Giovanni's arrest, during which Maria was mistreated by Florence's guards, she entered a semi-catatonic state. Cared for by Ezio's sister Claudia at the Villa Auditore, she remained silent for years until Ezio brought her a bundle of feathers he had collected during his travels, an activity that her youngest son Petruccio once engaged in. Brought back to life by Ezio’s gift, her temperament has been improving steadily since.

Records kept by her father's guards indicate Ezio visited her frequently in his youth and that he was "unbelievably dextrous", as the guards were never able to catch him trespassing. <br><br>In addition to her looks, Cristina also seems to have been somewhat responsible for jumpstarting the career of her cousin, the namesake of a rather famous landmass. At a dinner party attended by Cristina and, among other illustrious guests, Lorenzo de' Medici, she was reputed to have been in conversation with Lorenzo and Manfredo Soderini about her cousin's brilliance as a sailor. <br><br>Well, apparently, she exaggerated his importance slightly to impress Lorenzo, and Lorenzo, charmed by her beauty, agreed to hire him. "Try Amerigo out. I bet after several years you’ll name your shipping company after him", she is reported to have joked. <br><br>Biggest understatement of the century.

Watch out Catholics - your mistresses have more power than you think. <br><br>Once legitimately a Medici, this child of a tradesman's daughter went on to become Pope Clement VII. <br><br>Get this: Clement VII was Pope during the Sack of Rome in 1527, during which he was taken prisoner in the Castel Sant'Angelo. He escaped his captors disguised as…a tradesman. <br><br>Son of tradesman's daughter escapes poor past to become Pope, only to become a tradesman once more. Oh, the irony.

Date of Birth: 1416.<br>Profession: Gonfaloniere di Giustizia, Executor of the Ordinances of Justice.<br><br>One of Florence's most notable citizens, Uberto Alberti's keen grasp of justice helped shape law in the late 15th Century. Never playing to the emotions of the crowd, he was renowned for his fair sentencing and patronage of the arts. <br><br>Starting his carrier as a young lawyer, Uberto quickly became a member of the Conservatori delle Leggi, which sentenced Florentine criminals. Upset by the lack of judges on the committee, Uberto decided to take on the role himself, becoming a judge in 1440. From 1450-1460, he was rector of the University of Pisa, and then was elected to the Signoria, the most powerful council in Florence, in 1476.<br><br>Uberto's success story is all the more remarkable due to his tumultuous childhood. When Uberto was a 12, his father, Ottavio, went bankrupt and later killed himself, but Uberto managed to climb back from the brink of ruin, supporting both himself and his mother while simultaneously studying law.

MARIO AUDITORE

Id: [0x0004504A]
Date of Birth: 1434.<br>Profession: Condottiero, Noble.<br><br>One of several important condottieri patrolling the Tuscan countryside, Mario Auditore was a born leader. He began his military career as a six-year-old, when he played a significant role in the Florentine and Milanese conflict at the Battle of Anghiari. While on an expedition to Monterchi with his father, he alerted the Florentine general Micheletto Attendolo to the appearance of several dust clouds over the road which signalled a surprise advance by Milanese troops. Thanks to Mario, the Milanese attack was foiled and the Florentines won the battle.<br><br>Although Mario sided with Florence during Anghiari, for most of his career he defended the interests of his hometown Monteriggioni, derailing Florentine attempts to seize Tuscan territory. <br><br>While Mario's younger brother, Giovanni, moved to Florence in 1454 to pursue a career in banking, Mario stayed at the family's villa in Monteriggioni, stating in a letter to Giovanni that he "preferred fighting like a man, to filling out balance sheets".<br><br>After Giovanni's death, Mario brought Ezio, Claudia and Maria to the family Villa and taught Ezio about the conflict between the Assassins and Templars. Ever since, Ezio and his uncle have been inseparable.

According to court records, the day after, several cardinals discovered their purses robbed of all but their bibles.

GIOVANNI MOCENIGO

Id: [0x0004505B]
Date of Birth: 1409.<br>Profession: Doge of Venice.<br><br>Doge of Venice from 1478 to 1485, Giovanni Mocenigo accomplished two things. <br><br>He ended Venice's Turkish war through the Treaty of Constantinople in 1479. Basically the treaty was a huge white flag giving Turkey Venetian territory and an annual tribute of 10,000 ducats, in order to prevent the Turks from taking over Venice. Not exactly a win.<br><br>He killed the Pope. The end of Sixtus IV was nigh when Mocenigo attacked Ferrara, starting the Salt War. Ferrara had challenged Venice's ownership of several salt mines (apparently humans, like hamsters, need ample quantities of salt), so Venice used this pretext to enter into a war that was really about territorial expansion. <br><br>At first, the Pope fought alongside Venice, but then, once he realized Venice's territorial ambitions, switched sides. When Venice won, through the Treaty of Bagnolo, it gained significant territory, enlarging the Republic to the largest it would ever be. <br><br>When the Pope read the Treaty, he flew into a rage, and by the next day, he was dead. <br><br>Although, there were rumours that the Pope's death wasn't entirely caused by reading the Treaty, they have gone unproven.

Venice entered into war with Turkey in 1499, leading to the disastrous sea battle of Zonchio which destroyed the Venetian navy. Taking advantage of this loss, the Turks seized Lepanto, Modone and Corone, all stops along the way to the Orient.<br><br>Agostino died a disappointment to Venice. Moreover, after his death, he was charged with receiving bottles of wine as gifts and then reselling them tax free "beneath the staircase of the prisons", by the Inquisitors of the Great Council. <br><br>Now, that's a leader: if you can't keep your territory, at least keep your prisoners happy!

Date of Birth: 1450.<br>Profession: Madame of La Rosa della Virtù.<br><br>Although Teodora abandoned her family name when she entered the Church, Venetian tax records indicate that she grew up in the Contanto family. Her parents owned a jewellery store, and Teodora was apprenticed to her mother as a shop girl. <br><br>A visitor to the shop in 1462 wrote: "Bought a pair of diamond earrings today for Margarita, at the Contantos' shop around the corner. A charming young girl helped box them. When she handed me the earrings, our fingers touched. I had to leave the shop at once. Oh Lord, I wish I'd never married".<br><br>Court records indicate that by the time Teodora turned 17, she was doing far more than just touching. On the 26th of November, 1467, she engaged in adultery with a married man, and his wife alerted the Venetian courts. As was common in these sorts of situations, her parents reacted by sending her to a nunnery to live the rest of her life in prayer and silence. <br><br>Teodora entered Santa Maria degli Angeli in 1467, determined to do penance for her crime. But, in 1473, she deserted the Church, leaving a statement nailed to the front door. In it, she wrote that life in the cloisters was sterile and "earthly", and that only in "partnership with another" could one "truly enter the arms of God".<br><br>Teodora opened La Rosa della Virtù the same year. According to the poet Pietro Bembo, who was a frequent customer, her bordello was "the church for a new sect of Catholicism".

LEONARDO DA VINCI

Date of Birth: 1452.<br>Profession: Painter, Inventor, Designer, Architect, Scientist, Engineer.<br><br>The illegitimate son of a notary and a peasant woman, Leonardo da Vinci was raised in Tuscany. Like many destined to be superstars, he had no surname, Vinci being the town in which he was born. <br><br>At age 14, he was apprenticed to a Florentine painter, Verrocchio, who taught him chemistry, drafting, painting, sculpting and modelling. When he was 20, Leonardo established his own workshop, and then travelled across Italy, eventually painting his great masterpieces, "The Last Supper" in 1498 and "The Mona Lisa", in 1503-1507. <br><br>During his travels, Leonardo studied the world with unquenchable curiosity, recording his observations in mirror writing within his notebooks. While under the employ of Ludovico Sforza and then Cesare Borgia, he created designs for a helicopter, tank, naval bomber and a machine gun, among others. He was also an engineer, designing garrisons and movable barricades.<br><br>Despite this epic list of accomplishments, Leonardo was hounded by his patrons for his chronic procrastination. Pieces frequently took years longer than he anticipated and many were never finished at all. <br><br>Leonardo also had a tumultuous love life. Accused of sodomy in 1476, he was most likely homosexual. Salai, his assistant, was accused of stealing and spending too much money on clothes, but was also probably Leonardo's lover. Leonardo painted several pictures of Salai, including his famous "St. John the Baptist", and left "The Mona Lisa" to him when he died in 1519.

CATERINA SFORZA

Id: [0x00045096]
Date of Birth: 1463.<br>Profession: Countess of Forlì, Noble.<br><br>A countess by marriage, Caterina was notorious far before she ever arrived in Forlì. Raised in the Court of Milan, she received a classical education while tutored in the art of war by her father, the Duke. At court, Caterina also acquired a passion for alchemy and hunting. <br><br>In 1473, when she was 10-years-old, Caterina became engaged to Girolamo Riario, the Pope's nephew. They consummated their marriage when she was 14. <br><br>Once in Rome, she was heralded as one of the most outgoing nobles at court, while her husband had a reputation for being one of the most ruthless. With the premature death of the Pope's brother, Girolamo gained even more power, securing the titles of Lord of Imola and Forlì.<br><br>When the Pope died, looters sacked Rome, destroying Caterina's residence. Unafraid, despite being 7 months pregnant, Caterina rode on horseback to the Castel Sant'Angelo and defended the Vatican with cannon fire and soldiers. <br><br>In 1484, she moved with her family to Forlì. Paid off by someone with a grievance against her husband, the Orsi Brothers killed Girolamo in 1488. As a result, Caterina became the ruler of Forlì and Imola. <br><br>She wasted no time, winning the favour of nearby rulers, revising the tax system and training the militia herself. Although she advocated peace, when those around her were hurt she dealt fierce vengeance, frequently killing enemies' wives and children in punishment. <br><br>In 1499, Cesare, in his quest for territory, decided to return Forlì to Papal rule. Side note: The Papacy claimed ownership of most regions in Italy. These lands were leant out to rulers, but Papal troops could march in and reclaim them at any point, much like libraries set out to burn down the homes of those who keep books checked out for too long. As Cesare marched toward Caterina, she sent the Pope a friendly letter that had been rubbed with the sores of plague victims. It went downhill from there.<br><br>As an assault by papal forces became inevitable, Caterina snuck out of Forlì with a small company of soldiers on Christmas Day, 1499, and journeyed to Monteriggioni, seeking armed support from Ezio Auditore.

BARTOLOMEO D'ALVIANO

Id: [0x0004509E]
Date of Birth: 1455.<br>Profession: Condottiero.<br><br>Born in the town of Alviano in Central Italy, Bartolomeo grew up to be a clever and resourceful soldier. After spending several years in Venice, during which he aided Ezio Auditore in his campaign against Silvio Barbarigo and Dante Moro at the Arsenal, Bartolomeo joined the Orsini family in 1496 to fight against the Pope and Cesare, who were attempting to seize Orsini territory. <br><br>A few years before Cesare had him killed, the Pope's eldest son, Juan Borgia, the Duke of Gandia, waged an inept campaign against them. At one point during the siege of Bracciano, Bartolomeo sent an ass out of the gates with a sign around its neck reading: "Let me go for I am an ambassador to the Duke of Gandia". The letter roped to its tail contained further insults.<br><br>After his victory at Bracciano, Bartolomeo moved to Rome and remarried. Yes, Pantasilea Baglioni was not Bartolomeo’s first wife. Oddly enough, he originally paired up with his nominal doppelgänger Bartolomea Orsini, who died during the Borgia assault in 1497. He married Pantasilea the same year and immediately became entangled in a battle with the French faction of Cesare's army, led by the Baron de Valois. Just goes to show that wives may come and go, but battles are forever. <br><br>At the end of 1503, Bartolomeo left Rome after being hired by Ferdinand II of Spain to help the Spanish army defeat the French and seize the Kingdom of Naples. The following year, he defeated Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor, taking Trieste and Gorizia. Impressed, Venice elected him to the office of Governor General. <br><br>Everything was coming up roses for Bartolomeo, until the disastrous Battle of Agnadello in 1509, when he disobeyed orders to avoid combat and directly attacked the French army.<br><br>The battle was lost, Bartolomeo was captured and wounded by the French, and the Venetians lost Lombardy, a province it had taken them "eight hundred years exertion to conquer". <br><br>Furious, Venice refused to help Bartolomeo despite his claim that the French commander had stolen "a priceless Venetian artefact" which he was attempting to rescue. <br><br>Bartolomeo was kept in French prison until 1513. But, the French, as we all know, are very forgiving. He was sprung from jail to fight for them, managing to defeat the Swiss with only 300 men in 1515. <br><br>Later the same year, once restored to his former glory as General of the Venetian Army, he was killed besieging Brescia. <br><br>Venice welcomed his body home with a grand ceremony and buried him in the church of Santo Stefano.

NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI

Id: [0x000450A2]
Date of Birth: 1469.<br>Profession: Philosopher, Writer, Politician.<br><br>"Unarmed prophets have always been destroyed, whereas armed prophets have succeeded." <br><br>These cynical words were written by Niccolò Machiavelli, one of the greatest minds of the Renaissance. Considered a pioneer of Realist philosophy, he believed that all men are evil and will act upon their vicious nature, if given the chance.<br><br>The third son of a Florentine attorney, Machiavelli was tutored by his father in grammar, rhetoric and Latin. In 1494, he entered government service as a clerk and an ambassador. Made a member of the Florentine diplomatic council, he was sent to the courts of France, Spain and Rome between 1499 and 1512. It was during this time that he met Cesare. Immediately taken with the young Captain General, Machiavelli wrote: "I can find no fault with him." Machiavelli followed Cesare, learning his approach to war, until 1500, when he became de facto leader of the Assassins. <br><br>From 1500-1503, he settled in Rome, although little is known of his activities there.<br><br>In 1503, Machiavelli was put in charge of the Florentine militia and the city's defence. He recruited citizens for his militia, preferring men who had a stake in Florence's continued success to dispassionate mercenaries. His strategy seemed to work in 1509, when Florence defeated Pisa. <br><br>Machiavelli continued to participate in Florentine government after the Medici family was chased out. But, when the Medici returned, they arrested and tortured him. He was accused of conspiring against them. <br><br>Unable to find any wrongdoing, the Medici exiled Machiavelli. He retired to his estate in Santa Andrea, where he wrote his famous works "The Prince", "The Discourses on Livy" and "The Florentine Histories".<br><br>Machiavelli died in 1527. His place of burial remains unknown.

San Giovanni was named after Saint John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence. It is the oldest area of the city and the centre of administration, encompassing the Palazzo della Signoria. If big churches are your thing, head to Santa Maria del Fiore on the Northern edge. It's the one with the gigantic dome.

Dear Mr. Morgan: \n \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A serious matter has come to my attention. Nikola Tesla plans to use PE4 to create an information network across the entire world. And if that weren't bad enough, he intends to allow access to it for free! Imagine the masses spreading knowledge amongst themselves instantaneously. That would make everything we intend to do much more difficult. \n \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must cut all funds for his experiments at once! In case you get cold feet, I'll have you know he wants to make electricity free as well, thereby putting us out of business. \n \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've already begun slandering Tesla in the press. Just reallocate his funding, and I'll take care of PE4 myself. \n \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Edison, \n \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to thank you for letting me make use of PE4 all these years. Among several things, I was able to convince the workers I was raising their pay to $5 a day, when, in fact, I gave them a pay cut. But, I had to let PE4 go. As per instructions, I've shipped it to Europe. \n \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;H. has it, so I assume the war will begin as soon as he can take over.

I've enclosed a picture from Florida of you, me and Firestone.

ISSUE 1, JANUARY, 2012 \n \nThe scientific community is abuzz as the results of a new neurological study were made public today. What seemed to be big news in itself -- that Dr. Yijie Wu and Dr. P. J. Traunero had discovered a new neurotransmitter -- turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg. \n \nTo quote Dr. Wu, "Using a prototype dMRI machine, we've been able to examine the contents of an actual neuron in living tissue. We've found a substance that appears to be an undiscovered neurotransmitter." \n \n"(Here's) where it gets crazy. To test our findings, we subjected the neuron to all kinds of stimuli, but we couldn't get it to release the transmitter. So, we've discovered an entire mechanism: there are vesicles filled with neurotransmitter lying dormant and corresponding ion channels, all for no discernable purpose." \n \nExpressing bafflement that natural selection would create an unnecessary neurotransmitter, Wu and Traunero searched for a predecessor in other species, with no luck. \n \n"Whatever this bugger is used for, it evolved in humans," Traunero told the press.

I had thought Adha would be the one to lead me to rest, that I might lay down my blade and live as a normal man. But now I know such dreams are best left to sleep… <br><br>Her face. I try to banish it from my mind as I remember the days and nights during which I chased her Templar captors across the sea. I almost got to them in time. Almost. If I had only been faster. Instead, I held her lifeless body in my arms - saw the terror reflected in her fixed, unblinking eyes…<br><br>I hunted each man - one by one - until all responsible were gone from the world. But there was no joy in this. No satisfaction or release. Their deaths did not bring her back. Did not heal my wounds. After that, I was certain I would never again feel for a woman as I had for her.<br><br>I am fortunate to have been wrong.

Id: [0x00045174]
Why do our instincts insist on violence? I have studied the interactions between different species. The innate desire to survive seems to demand the death of the other. Why can they not stand hand in hand? So many believe the world was created by the hand of a divine power - but I see only the designs of a madman, bent on celebrating destruction and desperation. Our origins seem chaotic. Unintended. Purpose and being instilled solely by the passage of time. Imposed first by nature - and later men…

Id: [0x00045175]
Over time, any sentence uttered long and loud enough becomes fixed. Becomes a truth. Provided, of course, you can outlast the dissent and silence your opponents. But should you succeed - and remove all challengers - then what remains is, by default, now true.<br><br>Is it truth in some objective sense? No. But how does one ever achieve an objective point of view? The answer is you don't. It is literally, physically impossible. There are too many variables. Too many fields and formulae to consider. We can try, of course. We can inch closer and closer to a revelation. But we'll never reach it. Not ever… <br><br>And so I have realized, that so long as The Templars exist, they will attempt to bend reality to their will. They recognize there is no such thing as an absolute truth - or if there is - we are hopelessly underequipped to recognize it. And so in its place, they seek to create their own explanation. It is the guiding principle of their so-named "New World Order"; To reshape existence in their own image. It is not about artifacts. Not about men. These are merely tools. It's about concepts. Clever of them. For how does one wage war against a concept? <br><br>It is the perfect weapon. It lacks a physical form yet can alter the world around us in numerous, often violent ways. You cannot kill a creed. Even if you kill all of its adherents, destroy all of its writings - these are a reprieve at best. Some one, some day, will rediscover it. Reinvent it. I believe that even we, the Assassins, have simply re-discovered an Order that predates the Old Man himself…

Attis. Dionysus. Horus. Krishna. Mithra. Jesus. Similiar stories color their lives. Too similar, I think. Divine birthright. Persecution. Disciples. Miraculous acts. Resurrection…<br><br>How is it possible?<br><br>Perhaps it isn't… Merely a single story told over the ages? Borrowed then changed to fit the times? Evolving as our tools and language do? Is this tale borne of fact or fiction? A bit of both? Could these figures be the same person - their life extended and transformed by a Piece of Eden?<br><br>Al Mualim spoke of Jesus as a real person - a mortal who had mastered the arts of manipulation. But what if he was wrong? If these men are real - and if they have walked amongst us many times before - does it mean they'll come again? Perhaps they are here now? So many questions, and every day, even more…

The Hidden Blade has been a constant companion of ours over the years. Some would even say it defines us - and they would not be entirely wrong. Many of our successes would not have been possible without it. Still, the device has begun to show its age - and so I have been researching improvements beyond ending the need to remove one's finger to wield it. <br><br>The first is the addition of a metal plate that can be used to deflect incoming blows. The other Assassins believe it is forged of a new metal - and credit me with the discovery of the formulae (included on this page). It is better that they not know the truth. <br><br>I have also worked with Malik to describe new methods of assassination: from on high, from ledges, and from hiding places. Basic movements, but critical nonetheless. <br><br>The third and final improvement is the most simple - the provision of a second blade - identical in every way to the first. Should an Assassin ever find himself tasked with dispatching two targets, he need only time his strike in such a way that he might reach both at the same time. These blades will be limited in number since the metals with which we forge them remain difficult to obtain. I will need to think carefully about who shall be allowed to carry two…

Man seeks dominion over all that he encounters. I suppose it is a natural tendency for us to aspire towards mastery of our surroundings. But this should not include other human beings. Every day more and more are pressed into service - by deception or by force. Others, though not so firmly imprisoned, are made to feel as if their lives are worthless. I have seen the ways in which men persecute women. Heard the cruel words hurled at those who come here from other lands. Watched as those who believe or act differently are made to suffer…<br><br>We discuss such things often - watching as we do from the spires of Masyaf. What can be done to stop this? To encourage tolerance and equality? Some days we speak of education, believing that knowledge will free us from immorality. But as I walk the streets and see slaves sent off to auction - my heart grows cold. When I see the husband hurl abuses and stones at his wife, insisting she exists only to serve him - my fists clench. And when I see children torn from their parents so that another man might profit - sent off to suffer beneath the desert sun and die… <br><br>…On these days, I do not think that dialogue will make a difference. On these days, I can think only of how the perpetrators need to die.

The Apple is more than a catalog of that which precedes us. Within its twisting, sparking innards I've caught glimpses of what will be. Such a thing should not be possible. Perhaps it isn't. Maybe it is simply a suggestion. How to know? How to be sure?<br><br>I contemplate the consequences of these visions: are they images of things to come - or simply the potential for what might be. Can we influence the outcome? Dare we try? And in so doing, do we merely ensure that which we've seen? <br><br>I am torn - as always - between action and inaction - unclear as to which - if either - will make a difference. Am I even meant to make a difference? Still, I keep this journal. Is that not an attempt to change - or perhaps guarantee - what I have seen?

Of all the things I've seen, none troubles me more than the image of the flames… Pillars so tall they seemed to pierce the heavens. The ground rumbled and shuddered. Mountains split and crack. Great metal towers splintered, their innards strewn about the ground… And everywhere there was screaming. A chorus so terrible that even now I feel its echoes still. <br><br>What is this madness I have seen? Is it them, I wonder? Those who came before… Is this where they went? Into the fire? Into the dust? Perhaps this destructive power is what the Templars seek. That they might hold it over us and command devotion. What hope would we have, then, if they held such darkness in their hands - that they could murder the world…

We are obligated to hide. To be silent. To shape the course of history in secret. But some of my brothers and sisters disagree. They grow angry, insisting it is a mistake to shroud ourselves. They say it slows our work. But they do not understand the risks. To expose ourselves now would be too dangerous. I fear we would be branded madmen and attacked. So it goes. So it always has. If there is one thing I know for certain, it is that men do not learn by being told. Instead they must be shown. They must make the connections themselves. If I say unto a man, be kind, be tolerant, be of an open mind - these words will wither and die long before they've affected change. It would be a waste. And so we must maintain our course…

Legend speaks of a Golden Fleece.

Here we have crafted something that will surely change the face of warfare, making those who wear it nigh invincible… <br><br>Perhaps it was a mistake to create these pieces. I think it best to erase the formulae. What if it were to fall into the hands of our enemies? The risk is too great…

Id: [0x00045193]
I have studied the ancient pagan faiths that came before this more recent obsession with a single, divine creator. They seem to have focused more on the fundamental forces at play in the world around us and less on arbitrary moral rules… <br><br>The sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening. The tides ebb and flow. Grass grows, withers, dies, and then in time, emerges from the ground once more. The air turns warm then cools and back again. Some hidden energy keeps us fitted to the ground and pulls us back when we attempt to leave it. <br><br>Each of these movements was represented before by a god or goddess. Each force given face, but recognized as something distinct and powerful. Which is not to say there were not connections between these forces - a pantheon of individual spirits - of rules. Invisible hands guiding the progress of the world around us. <br><br>And so here there was an attempt to categorize, study, explain, and understand the way things work - even if it was flawed. But no more. Now we are asked to succumb to a far more simplified explanation. How naive to believe there might be a single answer to every question. Every mystery. That there exists a lone divine light which rules over all. They say it is a light that brings truth and love. I say it is a light that blinds us - and forces us to stumble about in ignorance. <br><br>I long for the day when men will turn away from invisible monsters and once more embrace a more rational view of the world. But these new religions are so convenient - and promise such terrible punishment should one reject them - I worry that fear shall keep us stuck to what is surely the greatest lie ever told.

More exotic species can sometimes be obtained from traders and travelers, but their properties are less documented and require further examination. <br><br>Traditional alchemical implements can be used to distill the poison.

Deviation may create fractures within the metal, causing the blade to weaken and possibly break.

What to make of this map? It appears to contain the entire world. Not flat as they claim, either, but round - like a ball. Like The Apple. But how is such a thing even possible? Stranger still are the lands it shows - great patches of the unknown. The unexplored. So many places yet to be discovered… Are there men there? Are they like us? And if not - different how? I should like to know the answers. Perhaps - in time - I'll have the chance to travel. To chart a course and make my way to these distant lands…

Some days I miss my family… Or at least the thought of them. I never knew my parents well, despite them both having lived within these walls. It was our way. Perhaps they were sad, though they showed no sign - it was not allowed. <br><br>For my part, so much of my youth was spent in training, there was little time left to reflect upon the separation. And so when they were finally lost to me, it seemed no different than the passing of two strangers. Al Mualim had been as my father, and his was a weak and dishonest love, though at the time it seemed enough - better, even. Or so I thought. <br><br>Some day I will have a child - such is the way of our Order. And I will not make the same mistake. Nor any who call themselves an Assassin. We shall be allowed to love our children - and, in turn, to be loved. Al Mualim believed such attachments would weaken us - cause us to falter when our lives were on the line. But if we truly fight for what is just, does love not make such sacrifice simpler - knowing that we do so for their gain?

I have the answer now. I know the truth. I shall not touch that wretched thing again. Best that no one do, now or ever. I have tried - at last - to destroy it, but it will neither bend nor break nor melt. Oh the irony - I am certain if I asked, the Apple would tell me what need be done. But even this promise is insufficient. Always it holds one more gift to give. I must refrain. So it shall be sealed. We will take it to the island - once theirs, now ours. There is a treasury there - hidden well - and it shall have to suffice. Risky to separate myself from the artifact that others may discover it. Riskier still to keep it close. In time I will be tempted. I am weak. We all are. Who wouldn't be? Oh, the things I have seen… The tale is here - inside the text. Not between the lines but beneath them. Where only our eyes might peer. Go and see it for yourself. That you might succeed where I and the others have failed. Time marches on - bringing with it new discoveries and developments. And so at least one day the doorway might be opened and the message delivered. They will have their prophet.

We are growing larger. More make their way to our fortresses every day. Men and women. Young and old. From different lands. Of different faiths. Each tells a similar story - of having discovered the first part of our creed: that nothing is true. <br><br>Too often, though, the revelation undoes them. They lose their morality, certainty, security. Many are driven mad. We must guide them. Help them to heal. Their minds must not be filled with more fairy tales, but with knowledge instead. Let them have answers - and let those answers be difficult and complex. Such is life.

Success! We have found a way to alter the structure of the hidden blade so that it can be used to launch small projectiles. It is capable of grievous damage - even from great distance. I confess, the means by which I came about the discovery was… risky to say the least. But I have found that in small doses, and with a focused mind, the Apple can be used without ill effect. Or so I hope.<br><br>The knowledge of projectile combat is not new to us, having been observed amongst our Eastern neighbors. But their weapons were much larger - and insufficient for our needs. I have now found a way to miniaturize their designs, embedding their fiery weapon into a form that can be worn on the wrist. <br><br>We have also refined the formula for combustible powder, such that common ingredients might be used. This is a dangerous bit of knowledge and it is best shared with only our closest allies…

A dark tide rises to the east - an army of such size and power that all the land is made quick with worry. Their leader is a man named Temujin, who has adopted the title Ghengis Khan. He sweeps across the lands, conquering and subsuming all who stand in his way. Whatever his motives, he must be stopped. Were I younger, I might attempt to undertake this work in secret - as I suspect the presence of a Piece of Eden. But those days are years gone, now. The mantle must be passed. It is time she and I spoke with our sons. We will travel there together, that they may be tested and that this threat might be stopped.

Soon I shall pass from this world. It is my time. All the hours of the day are now colored by the thoughts and fears borne of this realization. I know that the elements of my body will return to the Earth. But what of my consciousness? My identity? That is to say - what of ME? I suspect it will end. That there is no next world. Nor a return to this one. It will simply be done. Forever. <br><br>Our lives are so brief and unimportant. The cosmos cares nothing for us. For what we've done; Had we wrought evil instead of good. Had I chosen to abuse the Apple instead of seal it away. None of it would have mattered. There is no counting. No reckoning. No final judgment. There is simply silence. And darkness. Utter and absolute… And so I have begun to wonder - might there not be a way to stop - or at least delay - death's embrace? <br><br>Surely the ones who came before were not so frail and feeble as we. But I have sworn to be done with the artifact. To not gaze into its core. Still: faced as I am with the prospect of my end, what harm is there in one last look…

My love,<br><br>I put these thoughts to paper in the hope that I might one day have the courage to share them with you. In time, you'll no doubt learn that I betrayed Giovanni, labeled him a traitor and sentenced him to die. <br><br>History will likely judge this to have been a matter of politics and greed. Know that it was not hate that forced my hand, but fear. When the Medici robbed us of all we owned, I found myself afraid. For you. For our son. For the future. What hope in this world for a man without proper means? <br><br>They offered me money, land, and title in exchange for my collaboration. And so this is how I came to betray my closest friend.

Messer Francesco, <br><br>I have done as requested and spoken with your son. I agree with your assessment, though only in part. Yes, Vieri is brash and prone to act without forethought. And he has a habit of treating the mercenari like playthings. I've received reports of at least three men being disfigured as a result. But I do not think him, as you put it, beyond repair. Rather, I believe the solution to be a simple matter.<br><br>He seeks your approval. Your attention. These outbursts of his are a result of insecurities borne out of a sense of inadequacy. He speaks of you often and fondly and expresses a desire to be closer to you. So if he is loud and foul and angry - I believe it is simply because he wants to be noticed. He wants to be loved. <br><br>Act as you see fit on the information I've given you here. But I must ask that we end this correspondence.

I urge you to attend. Remaining here would be suicide. The Assassin is relentless. We cannot hope to stop him on our own. But perhaps, aided by Maestro, we might buy ourselves the time to form a proper response. <br><br>Guard yourself well.

Though we could not be together, just knowing you were near was enough. And now, with Marco dead, I may yet find a way for us to be joined again. <br><br>But do you even remember me? Or were the wounds too grave? Do my words stir - if not your memory, then your heart? It doesn't matter what they say - I know you're still in there, somewhere. <br><br>I will find a way, my love. To remind you. To restore you…<br><br>Love always,<br><br>Carlotta

Al Magnifico Lorenzo de' Medici mio protettore e amico: <br><br>I have done as requested and completed my investigation into the Milano incident. I can confirm for you that it extends far beyond dissatisfaction with Duca Galeazzo Sforza's rule. It is my belief that other parties, desirous of far greater gains, manipulated events in such a way as to achieve their goals without being revealed themselves. <br><br>Lampugnani, Olgiati, and Visconti are guilty of the crime, to be sure. And they have met fitting ends for their betrayal. But several other noble families are implicated as well, our own Francesco de' Pazzi among them. <br><br>Their cause and motive is not yet clear to me, but initial findings indicate a plan - the scope of which is sure to disturb you. Best we continue this conversation in person as I am hesitant to put my suspicion to paper. Reply with a place and time, and I will meet you there. I have also ordered Francesco be held by the Gonfaloniere until we can clear up this matter. <br><br>Yours in confidence, <br><br>Giovanni

Dear Father,<br><br>It has been almost a week since I abandoned my schooling. I don’t expect you to understand why, I can’t really explain it myself, but I feel the world flying by and I need to catch it, to become part of its tides and currents. I’m not very good with speaking or numbers, but with my hands I can shape everything flowing around me, every moment, every mood. <br><br>I know that you wanted me to become something more than an artist, but, please, for the sake of my future, relent. As you have always known, I am much more interested in sculpting and painting than I am in studying and now the artist Domenico Ghirlandaio has asked me to join him as an apprentice. He just got back from Roma, where he painted a masterful panel in the Cappella Sistina. If I work hard, I might even be invited inside the Vatican, and maybe I’ll get to see it. <br><br>Please give your blessing to this apprenticeship. I promise to live up to your lofty expectations, and I hope that one day you will be proud of me.<br><br>Your son,<br><br>Michelangelo

Politics, politics, always politics. You swear that you are too busy at court to visit your son, but that is a lie. I know that you do not want to be seen with him. How many heirs has your supposed wife, Bella, produced? None, by my count, and I keep track. You think that I am beneath you, and you may be right, but at least I had the courage to take care of your son rather than throw him out in the street, which many a night I yearned to do. Instead, I have raised him to be a good boy. He minds the house while I work in the shop. <br><br>Now, he’s almost all grown up and the heir to your estate. And who do you have? An upper-class wife, who commandeers your money, wears a wig and parades around like a peacock, in spite of the fact she is as infertile as a donkey. I may envy your money and your masculinity, Vincente, but I do not envy you that. <br><br>Visit our son or not, he’ll have your estate soon enough. May God comfort you during the endless winter of your fertility. <br><br>Ciao,<br><br>Diana

Dear Luca,<br><br>I have been working to find a match for your daughter, but I find that most men in San Gimignano are weak and foolish, and those who are not are put off by your daughter’s displays of independence. One potential suitor was shocked by her desire to leave the house without a head covering; another was dismayed to find that she had planned the activities for the day herself. This cannot continue to go on if I am to find a husband for her. <br><br>Take out the stick and beat her if you have to, but make sure she is docile the next time I bring a suitor by. If you cannot straighten her out, we may have to consider a nunnery. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Rigarda

Such behavior is forbidden in Forlì. If you are not aware of the charges against you, read Leviticus 18:23. <br><br>Report to us, or a contingent of guards will be sent to arrest you.<br><br>Cordially,<br><br>Andrea Allegro

OTTAVIANO RIARIO

Id: [0x000452B6]
Date of Birth: 1479.<br>Profession: Count, Noble.<br><br>Ottaviano entered the service of the Florentine Republic as a condottiero when he was 19, at the request of his mother, Caterina Sforza, who wanted to cement amiable relations with Florence. He commanded 100 men from Forlì, but terminated his contract after only a year because Florence didn't have the money to pay him. <br><br>Despite accounts which describe Ottaviano as obese, brainless and under his mother's thumb, Pope Alexander VI (Rodrigo Borgia) offered his daughter Lucrezia to Ottaviano. Why? Because Rodrigo decided that those were traits he could tolerate in a son-in-law as long as that son-in-law was the key to controlling the territories of Forlì and Imola. Plus, his praying mantis of a daughter, Lucrezia, rarely stayed married to one man for long. Her husbands tended to sign declarations of impotence or just simply disappeared. Wisely, Caterina denied the marriage, enraging the Pope and leading to his son, Cesare's, assault on Forlì.<br><br>When Caterina was ousted by Cesare and entered her exile in Florence, under her guidance Ottaviano attempted to convince the new pope, Julius II, to give him back the lordship of Imola and Forlì, but instead Ottaviano ended up selling the Riario claim to Julius, for an I.O.U. no less.

BIANCA RIARIO

Id: [0x000452B8]
Date of Birth: 1478.<br>Profession: Noble.<br><br>Some people live a dream, Bianca Riario…was not one of those people. In 1484, at the age of 6, she witnessed the sacking of her family's palazzo in Rome and was carried by her lunatic warrior mother into a siege at the Castel Sant'Angelo. <br> <br>Next, dragged by her family to Forlì, far more horrifying delights awaited her. Shortly after Bianca's 10th birthday, her father, Girolamo, was stabbed to death and his naked body thrown into the middle of the town square. Then her family's palazzo was sacked AGAIN and she was kidnapped by the Orsi Brothers. <br><br>Bianca escaped the Orsis and returned to her mother (how exactly this escape was accomplished is unknown). Then, when she was 16, while out on a hunting expedition with her mother's new husband, Giacomo Feo, she witnessed his brutal ambush and assassination. In 1500, Bianca's mother was taken prisoner by Cesare Borgia and apparently raped by Rodrigo Borgia and Cesare. <br><br>Cesare then killed Bianca's husband, Astorre III Manfredi, in 1502. She married again, this time to a count, Troilo I de' Rossi, who died in 1521, at which point, she wisely decided to give up on life, and went to her grave sometime around 1522.

FORLÌ

Id: [0x000452BA]
Founded in 798,000 B.C.E. by Palaeolithic cavemen who were interested in flint manufacturing, Forlì has been an industrial centre ever since. The name comes from the Romans (Forum Livii) who built the city in 188 B.C.E. along the Via Aemilia, one of several roads they laid after pacifying the Gauls in the region. After Roman rule, it went from Lombard hands into Church hands and then became an independent republic in 889, infuriating the Vatican, which spent the next 400 years trying to get it back. <br><br>On top of Rome's constant manipulations, Forlì had to deal with a steady stream of Goth, Byzantine, Lombard, and Frank marauders for the next few centuries, along with annual flooding, which was finally brought under control by diverting nearby rivers away from the city's center in 1050. <br><br>Like most independent republics, Forlì became a military dictatorship at the end of the 13th Century and then was passed to the Ordelaffi family, who, despite having a lion with its tongue playfully sticking out as a crest, were not all that cute or nice. <br><br>In 1480, with the Ordelaffi fighting amongst themselves over the chain of succession, the Pope stepped in and gave the city to his nephew, Girolamo Riario. But things didn't really go as planned for the Pope: when Girolamo was killed, the city passed to his wife, Caterina Sforza, the Amazon of Forlì, who fought tooth and nail to prevent the Vatican from taking control. Ultimately, however, Caterina was vanquished and Forlì passed into Church hands.

OLTRARNO DISTRICT

Id: [0x000452BC]
The district across the river, as it is referred to by Florentines (Oltrarno literally means "on the other side of the Arno"), Oltrarno is one of the oldest areas of the city, and heavily populated by craftsmen. In addition, the religious community is well represented, with the monastery and church of Santo Spirito. <br><br>Later in Florentine history, the Medici bought the Pitti Palace, connecting it to the Palazzo della Signoria and the Uffizi with a series of secret passages, one of which crossed the upper level of the Ponte Vecchio. The network was a smart investment considering all the different people throughout the Renaissance who had attempted to kill them.

VENEZIA

Id: [0x0004538A]
Likely established sometime around the late 7th century, Venice's lagoon-locked location was the result of Byzantine settlers attempting to hide from Lombard invaders. By the Middle Ages, the city had grown into a great naval power. Its strategic position at the top of the Adriatic meant that ships taking goods inland had to go through Venice, filling its coffers with money and commerce. <br><br>Entering the late Middle Ages, Venice exercised influence over both its neighbouring states and the Church. When the Fourth Crusade rolled around in 1202, the crusaders required transport on Venice's ships, which the Venetian Doge, Enrico Dandolo, agreed to on the condition that the crusaders retake the Dalmatian city of Zadar and then capture Constantinople. <br><br>When Constantinople fell, the city was sacked by the Venetian fleet, which stole, among other things, four bronze horses as ornaments for the Basilica San Marco. Now, that's what I call a faith-based initiative. <br><br>As Venice's wealth grew, so did its fleet. Through sea battles she gained Byzantine territory, Hungarian territory and destroyed the Genoese fleet. Venice's fortunes were so entwined with the sea that every year the Doge would throw a ring into the lagoon while saying in Latin: "We wed thee, sea, in the sign of the true and everlasting Lord". Despite much eye-raising about the godliness of sea-human relations, the Pope sanctioned the marriage. <br><br>By the end of the 15th century, Venice was quite possibly the wealthiest city in the world and the second-largest city in Europe after Paris, but the rest of Europe had had enough. France, Spain, Austria and Hungary joined together in the League of Cambrai, partnering with Pope Julius II to crush Venice. <br><br>But Venice was able to weather the storm, ultimately keeping her territories even after several disastrous defeats. But she would never expand again. Turkey attacked in the 18th century, and Venice began a long decline which ultimately ended in 1797, when Austria took control of the Republic.

FIRENZE

Id: [0x0004538C]
Founded by Julius Caesar in 59 B.C.E., Florentia, as it was called by the Romans, quickly became a centre of commerce. <br><br>After the sacking of Rome, in the 5th century, the Ostrogoths took over. Under their rule, the city was constantly under attack from the Byzantines, who sent the population level below 1,000. The Lombards came to power in the 6th century, ending the Byzantine assaults. <br><br>Florence grew to a population of 80,000 in the 14th century, of which 25,000 were working in the wool industry. In 1378, a major revolt of the lower class led to the wool combers rising up and seizing the government of the city. Their progressive, radical democracy lasted for less than 2 months before the upper classes seized control once more, but the revolt so terrified the rich, that a century later it was still discussed in hushed tones, much as the 1960s hippy movement is today.<br><br>The Albizzi family became the de facto rulers after the revolt. Worried about the rise of the Medici family, who were newly rich bankers rapidly gaining influence in Florence, Maso and Rinaldo Albizzi imprisoned Cosimo de'Medici and exiled him in 1433. But Cosimo gained influence behind the scenes, and rose to power in 1434, exiling the entire Albizzi family except for Luca, who had been loyal to Cosimo. Luca Albizzi joined the Signoria, the ruling body of Florence, as Gonfaloniere, succeeding Cosimo's old friend Ilario Auditore in 1442.<br><br>Under the Medici family, which built impressive public buildings and supported such luminaries as Michelangelo, Leonardo and Botticelli, the Renaissance began with Florence securely at its centre.

This document is meant to serve as a record of all I've learned over the past few weeks, in the event that I am silenced and prevented from sharing it with you myself. Understand first that the Duke of Milan's murder was no mere political maneuver. Rather, it is but a piece of a conspiracy that reaches far beyond Firenze, counting members in Roma, Venezia, and Forlì - to name but a few cities.<br><br>Attached to this note is a list - or rather, the start of one - of those I know to be guilty. Its contents are by no means complete, but I intend to rectify that shortly. I can, however, say with certainty that the Pazzi family is involved. <br><br>We must move quickly to question Francesco before he buys his freedom from prison. Doing so will surely add more names to the list. I already have my suspicions as to who these men are, given that their deeds bare all the hallmarks of an old enemy. I fear they-- <br><br>(The note abruptly ends here. Giovanni must have had to stop and hide it when the guards showed up to arrest him.)

BROTHER O'CALLAHAN

Id: [0x00045690]
Date of Birth: 1452.<br>Profession: Monk.<br><br>Born beyond the Pale (outside the area of British control in Ireland, which was considered savage, hence, the expression "beyond the pale"), Darby O'Callahan spent his teen years hunting and raiding British settlements. In his papers, he describes the time period as "a dark point in my life, but, to be honest, I had my fun too".<br><br>When O'Callahan's Gaelic father married a Catholic, everything changed. "He forced me to work the fields. No more raiding, no more girls. It was Hell on Earth", says one particular entry, dated 1462. To escape his father, O'Callahan decided to become a monk: "I was told by my mother that monks did little work, and threw large feasts for the seasonal holidays".<br><br>He joined the Abbeylara Monastery in 1462, becoming a Cistercian. Ultimately, however, O'Callahan found the order too austere: "We worked in the fields from dawn until dusk, Abbott Shaw wouldn't allow us to drink, and worst of all, the only girls were nuns. This was a deeper level of Hell than I had ever imagined possible".<br><br>Convincing a small group of his fellow monks to join the Dominicans, Darby left Ireland in 1463 for Italy: "where we can hire farmers to work for us in the fields. Then, when we give our sermons, we will see the beauty of the Lord in the golden light of Italy and the soulful faces of the farmer's wives". <br><br>Ultimately, O'Callahan was kicked out of the Dominican order in 1493, due to "repeated attempts to convert townspeople while within a drinking house". In Darby's own accounts he claims that he had great success with the conversions, although the men "refused to come to church, so I had to return to the ale house for repeat visits to preach the word of the Lord to their receptive ears".<br><br>O'Callahan moved to the Romagna countryside in 1494, starting a monastery dedicated to the Order of St. Patrick in an abandoned church, but he didn't have much success in securing converts. <br><br>In 1500, he died of what had been described as "bad blood", but was most likely syphilis. His body was buried in the small cemetery beside the church.

Dear Vincente,<br><br>I have received evidence to prove our worst suspicions: your daughter is marrying an imposter. Although Leone claims to be a Guelph, he is, in fact, Florentine. This is further proof that those liars and cheats are trying to invade our government, and further take away what little independence we have. If, upon reading this, your blood is boiling as much as mine, I say we drop him off the Torre Grossa, that will send a message to Florence.<br><br>Yours,<br><br>Ramondo<br><br>P.S. Once you have disposed of this annoyance, my son is of eligible age, as you know. Perhaps your daughter’s hand would be better suited for his.

Upgrading Monteriggioni's shops and buildings enables you to receive a percentage of the profits from the city's enterprises. As the buildings are renovated, the city will likely see new visitors and the money you receive will increase. In addition, the shops you've restored will give you a discount on all purchases made there. <br><br>By renovating buildings or through the prestige acquired when collecting objects such as paintings, feathers, and weapons, Monteriggioni will become a more popular destination, meaning more money for you.

Id: [0x00045F1A]
Robbers will sometimes attempt to steal some of your money. Should one succeed, you have the option of chasing him down. Stopping a robber will return your money, provided you can catch him.

Id: [0x00045F1B]
Borgia Couriers carry large sums of money on them. They know who you are and will flee immediately upon spotting you. If you manage to catch one, he'll give you whatever he's carrying. <br><br>Killing a Borgia Courier will make you notorious immediately.

When holding a long weapon, such as a spear, press and hold [X] to perform a sweep attack. A successful sweep attack will trip your opponents and knock them to the ground, making them vulnerable to a finishing move. The longer you hold [X], the wider the sweeping motion will be.

Id: [0x00045F1D]
When holding a heavy weapon (such as a two-handed sword or axe), press and hold [X] to perform a smash attack. The attack cannot be blocked and will deal increased damage to your opponent. If [X] is held long enough before attacking, you'll be able to knock the weapon out of his hands.

Id: [0x00045F1E]
With throwing knives equipped, hold [X] to fire knives at multiple targets simultaneously, killing all of them instantly. The longer you hold the button, the more targets you'll hit.

Id: [0x00045F1F]
With the pistol equipped, holding [X] causes enemy morale to fall. Once their morale reaches zero, enemies will flee from the fight. Use this to quickly rid yourself of lower rank enemies.

Id: [0x00045F20]
Enemies have a morale value. Performing spectacular actions in a fight will cause their morale to drop. If their morale level reaches zero, they will stop fighting and flee.

Id: [0x00045FF9]
With the advent of double entry bookkeeping, which allowed bankers to keep track of their clients' deposits and withdrawals, and the proliferation of many different types of Italian currency into the pool of circulation, banks became an essential part of everyday Renaissance life.<br><br>Banks technically couldn't make money on their money, because the Catholic Church forbade the charging of interest, but in practice this restriction wasn't followed by bankers, or even by the Vatican, which participated in the banking system and required banks to pay the Pope "gifts" in proportion to the amount of money he had deposited with them. As long as it isn't called "interest", God won't notice, right?

What you missed: It looks like after recovering the Apple of Eden from Rodrigo Borgia, Ezio travelled with Caterina Sforza and Machiavelli to Forlì to hide it. But something must have happened in Forlì, because now Girolamo Savonarola, the mad monk, has both the Apple and Florence under his control.

The Frenchman Charles de la Motte questions the courage of Italy and has called a tournament to prove his men are superior. He questions our chivalry. While our knights will certainly fight with honor, we will not. We cannot afford to give France this victory. Do not enter the tournament, but use whatever means necessary to weaken the enemy before it begins.

Id: [0x000475E8]
A German Jew, Asher Lämmlein, has proclaimed himself a forerunner of the Jewish Messiah. Though he seems to preach charity and repentance, his power grows too quickly and his followers threaten our work. Convince Lämmlein that he must disappear.

Id: [0x000475E9]
The poet scholar, Michael Tarchaniota Marullus, has been our most valuable informant. His natural charisma and wild poetry has gained him access to some of the most powerful people of our time. In service to our guild, he has also made many enemies. He have agreed to fake his death. Craft his drowning in the River Cecina and see to his safe disappearance.

Id: [0x000475EA]
Piero de' Medici is nothing like his father. His cowardice has gained him Charles VIII's favor and the fool even supports his new master on the battlefield. Our ties to his family and his unpredictable behavior have left us no choice. Medici must be killed.

Id: [0x000475EB]
Two scholars work hard to understand the science behind the heavens, Domenico Maria Novara and his young assistant, Niccolò Copernico. They are close to a breakthrough, one that will embarrass the church. As a result, their lives are in danger. Intercept their assassin and allow them to work undisturbed.

Id: [0x000475EC]
Our trouble with Portugal has not ended. Our spies learned of Manuel's disappointment with Cabral and his impending response to our defiance in Calicut. Vasco da Gama now sails for Calicut with a fleet 800 men strong. The implications should be obvious. You must board a merchant vessel and deliver a warning.

Id: [0x000475ED]
As a Master of Ceremonies at the papal court, Johannes Burckard witnesses and records the most shameful secrets of the Borgia papacy. He also enjoys a little embellishment. Rodrigo has found out that Johannes has kept a diary and he wants it seized. He has also ordered the death of the impudent author. You will ensure that the attempt fails.

Id: [0x000475EE]
Urbino's Duchess, Elisabetta Gonzaga risks her life to attend Borgia's Jubilee. No doubt Cesare views her presence here as an insult and he will not let it go unanswered. You are to ensure that the Duchess exits Rome unharmed.

Id: [0x000475EF]
As Cesare sets his eyes upon Camerino, we must fight to protect her. Bartolomeo's brother, Abbot Bernardino, actively works against the Borgia in Camerino, but the Church has grown suspicious. Mercenaries have been sent to restrain Bernardino, but you will intercept them first.

Id: [0x000475F0]
Machiavelli has been tracking one of Borgia's trained killers and believes he has finally found a way to catch her. The Venetian ambassador, Antonio Giustinian, recently pushed Rodrigo too far. As an "apology" for losing his temper, Rodrigo has arranged a dinner between Antonio and a lady of the court, whom we suspect to be the murderess. You will go in Antonio's stead.

Id: [0x000475F1]
Giovanni Sforza's humiliation at the hands of Lucrezia Borgia and her family makes him a valuable ally. As her former husband, he has unique insight into their operations. We will need to gain his trust. The diplomat Pandolfo Collenuccio has betrayed Giovanni's city, Pesaro, to the Borgia. Bring him to us.

Id: [0x000475F2]
Pandolfo Petrucci, the tyrant of Siena, appears to be loyal to the Borgia, but we know that he secretly plots against them. He underestimates Cesare's spies. Cesare has invited Petrucci to a meeting in Senigallia, where he will be executed. You must prevent him from attending that meeting.

Id: [0x000475F3]
Many in the papacy believe Rodrigo bought his way into the papal throne, perhaps none of them as vocal as Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere. Cesare will send his henchmen to Savona to deal with Rovere. You must stop them while we send warning.

Id: [0x000475F4]
Rodrigo is wary of any peace between Venice and the Ottoman Empire, though it draws near. We can be sure Borgia mercenaries will attempt to disrupt this treaty, so you must be on guard. It is critical that our involvement remains secret. Work within the shadows. Success means we solidify Borgia's enemies.

Id: [0x000475F5]
Machiavelli's connections with Pier Soderini present us with an interesting opportunity. Florence will soon elect him gonfaloniere for life, granting him significant power and Machiavelli plans to be a constant whisper in his ear. Soderini's election has several vocal opponents among the Piagnoni.

Id: [0x000475F6]
As powerful nations launch their expeditions into uncharted seas and claim pieces of the New World, we must ensure that our Brotherhood expands to keep our enemy in check. An exceptional Ottoman cartographer, Piri Reis, has begun to compile detailed maps of these territories. Find his workshop and steal what you can.

Id: [0x000475F7]
Massa Marittima has long competed against the church over its invaluable alum mine and the church responded with the excommunication of the city's citizens. As Cesare bolsters his war effort, he sends his soldiers to claim the Massa Marittima mine. You will stand in their path.

Id: [0x000475F8]
As Cesare expands his empire, he continues to displace nobles and claim their territory. We can make these conquests much less profitable to the Borgia. Iacopo Appiano, Lord of Piombino was ejected from his port city. He tells us that Cesare's men load their spoils on several merchant vessels, set for Roma. Sabotage them.

Id: [0x000475F9]
Our Brotherhood uses cryptic means to record our history, but none quite as sophisticated as our artistic ventures. Pinturicchio already works with us, but will soon meet with his understudy, Raphael. We need you to attend that meeting.

Id: [0x000475FA]
A man hated by his own people, Pandolfo Malatesta was excommunicated by the church, stripped of his city, Rimini, and abandoned by his own subjects. You will make sure his spirit is not broken. We need to spread Cesare's army thin, creating as many distractions as we can.

Id: [0x000475FB]
Louis d'Armagnac and the French army move to engage the Spanish at Cerignola. You will deliver a message to d'Armagnac before the battle begins. It is a forged letter from Cesare, vastly underestimating the Spanish forces and promising Italian reinforcements. The French will be slaughtered.

Id: [0x000475FC]
One of Cesare's captains, Ramiro d'Orco, continues to butcher the citizens of Cesena. Fear prevents them from action. You must infiltrate the crowd and give them a voice. Turn them against the Borgia.

Id: [0x000475FD]
One of Cesare's trusted friends keeps a dangerous secret from him. Duarte Brandao was once Sir Edward Brampton and called England his home, but fled from deadly politics. You will use this knowledge to bend his loyalty to us. Find out what he knows.

Id: [0x000475FE]
Cesare enjoys a disgusting sport each month, lining up Borgia prisoners in a courtyard and ravaging them with his crossbow from the balcony above. You will intercept his escorted prisoners and free them. Cut the tongues from the guards, strip them, and send them into the courtyard. Leave the rest of the work to Cesare.

Id: [0x000475FF]
With the death of Marco Barbarigo, we left Venice in the care of Agostino Barbarigo, who swore to avoid his brother's path of corruption and his link to the Borgia. He has failed. He secretly courts the Borgia and has become known for his greed, extortion and for selling justice.

We have taken Pandolfo Collenuccio. As a gesture of good will to Giovanni Sforza, we have gifted him the traitor. In return, he has agreed to a meeting with Machiavelli.

Id: [0x0004B28A]
Petrucci's men put up a fight and we were forced to kill several of them before we could deliver our message. Should he choose to follow our advice, he will avoid that meeting and live to oppose Cesare's forces.

Id: [0x0004B28B]
We called upon our courtesan allies to board a ship with Borgia's men. While the men were distracted, we sabotaged their supplies and ensured that they will not reach Savona before the cardinal can escape. Rather than kill them, we believe sending them back to report their failure will do more damage to our enemy.

Id: [0x0004B28C]
As expected, Rodrigo sent a small band of mercenaries to remove key players from the negotiations. We killed them before they could leave the port. With our careful manipulation, the sultan of Constantinople and the doge of Venice were able to reach an agreement. Free trade has resumed, but more importantly, we have weakened the Borgia.

Id: [0x0004B28D]
We silenced the Piagnoni and Soderini's election went as planned. Though Machiavelli doubts Soderini's ability to lead, he is convinced he will be able to mold him to fit our needs.

The Ottoman Empire has developed stunning maps of the world, and while we do not doubt their accuracy, we are a bit overwhelmed by the necessity to act quickly; some of these maps track our common enemy to the new colonies.

Cesare's men have been slain. The citizens of Massa Marittima generously rewarded us with materials from their mine and we believe we will be able to negotiate a long term supply deal with them.

Raphael hesitated when we presented our proposal. He believes his work will be mired by outside influence, but we assured him our messages are subtle and interpreted only through figures and their gestures. He has agreed to aid us at a future time, perhaps through tapestries.

Id: [0x0004B292]
Malatesta has earned his reputation. He is a murderer and a rapist. Nevertheless, we have convinced him to fight back against the Borgia. He will try to reclaim Rimini when he is able to muster the forces. Hopefully he will fall in battle.

Id: [0x0004B293]
The battle ended as predicted. The French engaged the Spanish and d'Armagnac never received his reinforcements. He was cut down by enemy gunfire alongside his men. His courier will report the results to Louis XII, straining the Borgia alliance with France.

Id: [0x0004B294]
We had the crowd demanding blood and they received it. Ramiro d'Orco's body was cut in twain and displayed for his citizens. Though the Borgia seem to be avoiding blame for d'Orco's actions, we did cause them to murder one of their own tyrants.

Id: [0x0004B295]
Fortunately Brandao fears Cesare as well as England. He will not risk either discovering his identity. He has provided us with battlefield reports and maps. Our scholars are reviewing them now.

Cesare's guards screamed and wept while he laughed. He is an excellent shot and quickly slaughtered the entire group. He will not be amused when he discovers their identities.

Louis XII has left his kingdom in the hands of Templars loyal to the Borgia. They have captured one of our Brothers and now subject him to torture in order to loosen his tongue. If they break him, the impact could be staggering. Confront archbishop Georges d'Amboise, Louis' chief advisor. No doubt the Borgia have his ear.

We were surprised to find d'Amboise eager to talk. He was outraged, but not surprised, by our accusations that Louis' advisors are taking advantage of the king's absence to broker deals with Rome. He provided us with a list of ministers who he believed were involved. They were. We buried three of them and we now know where they are holding our Brother. He is well protected. We will need time to prepare.

MAN DOWN

We have no more time to spare. Take a group to assault the manor where our Brother is held captive. If he lives, free him, then follow the trail of any information he has revealed and end it.

We were forced to eliminate a dozen guards before reaching the manor's interior. We found our Brother, but his legs had been crushed. He had remained strong, giving them more false trails than actual details. Before he died, he gave us a warning, something he overheard from his Templar torturers: we should be wary of the Orsini.

An early portrait by Raphael that demonstrates his expert use of geometry.

Id: [0x0004CB61]
This angel painted by Raphael stood next to Nicholas of Tolentino with the devil at his feet. Raphael finished the painting in 1501 as part of a larger altarpiece.

A self portrait of the artist Raphael, painted around 1504.

Id: [0x0004CB65]
Raphael painted this work for the Duke of Urbino, who Cesare had chased from his palace. In it, St. Michael is combating the demons of Hell.

Id: [0x0004CB66]
Raphael's Reurrection of Christ employs complex geometry to create such a dramatic composition. This is one of his earliest known works.

Id: [0x0004CB67]
A painting by Raphael about the role of the ideal knight. The sword, book and flower represent the scholar, soldier and lover, each making up a piece of the personality of the ideal knight.

Id: [0x0004CB68]
An early Madonna painted by Raphael between 1500 and 1504. Two of his signature motifs, the Virgin reading a book and a small bird, can be seen.

Id: [0x0004CB69]
This painting by Raphael depicts a marriage between Mary and Joseph. In the background the painting showcases the Renaissance ideals of ordered, geometrical architecture.

Id: [0x0004CB6A]
Supposedly a portrait by Raphael of one of Lucrezia's lovers, the Poet Bembo, the picture barely resembles him leading to speculation that the person portrayed is someone else entirely.

Raphael's Madonna was painted as a wedding present for a friend. Notice how the composition of Mary, Jesus and John the Baptist is arranged into a triangle, as was common at the time.

Templars actively struggle to gain power over the English throne. King Henry VII spoiled their first two attempts, imprisoning Lambert Simnel and hanging Perkin Warbeck, both pretenders to the throne. Both of them had a co-conspirator: Margaret of York, but Henry cannot touch her due to her family ties to the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry does not know who we are, but he knows what we can do. Meet with him. Assure him you will see to it that Margaret dies "naturally."

Id: [0x0004CB77]
Richmond, England

Id: [0x0004CB78]
Margaret of York has died a "peaceful" death. Outside the Brotherhood, King Henry alone knows of our involvement. We will let him believe our services were bought with royal coin, but, in truth, we dealt a major blow to the Templar scheme in England.

Id: [0x0004CB79]
PRETENDERS

Id: [0x0004CB7A]
Margaret's death has sent her co-conspirators scrambling into the streets of small baronies throughout England. They urge the people to rise up against Henry's throne. While we have no interest in protecting Henry from his people, we must not allow Templars to lead the rebellion. Find the leaders of these rallies and kill them.

Id: [0x0004CB7B]
London, England

Id: [0x0004CB7C]
These men were underlings and played a small role in Margaret's plan. Perhaps even distractions to keep us from the real plot -- the Templars have infiltrated the Star Chamber, England's secret court.

DOUSING FIRES

Id: [0x0004CB7E]
King Henry uses the Star Chamber to try powerful public figures on without any public knowledge of the proceedings. Through it, he is able to castrate dangerous political enemies.

PALAZZO SENATORIO

Id: [0x0004CC00]
Built during the 13th and 14th century as the Senatorial seat for administration of justice in Rome, the Palazzo is the dominating structure of the Campidoglio. Tourists today would see an impressive double-flighted staircase in front, which was designed by Michelangelo. <br><br>Not only intended to induce fear in the climacophobic, these stairs were a part of a commission Michelangelo received to redo several of the buildings on the Campidoglio at the behest of Pope Paul III for the sole purpose of impressing Charles V, then ruler of the Holy Roman Empire. Basically, the Renaissance political equivalent of a toddler doing headstands for his daddy.

Id: [0x0004CC01]
PALAZZO DEI CONSERVATORI

Id: [0x0004CC02]
One of the structures that comprises the Campidoglio, this Palazzo served as the seat of the Roman magistrate responsible for administrating the city, or as the Pope liked to call them, his "party-planning committee". By the end of the 15th century, they had very little actual power, the Pope ran the city from the Vatican.<br><br>In the mid-16th century, Michelangelo got his talented little hands on the building, re-designing the facade and adding gigantic Corinthian pilaster strips on high pedestals to make it a little less ostentatious. I'm not certain he succeeded.

Id: [0x0004CC03]
BASILICA DI SANTA MARIA IN ARA COELI

Id: [0x0004CC04]
Adjacent to the Campidoglio square, this Basilica became the centre for religious and civic life in the city during the 14th century. The architect claimed climbing the daunting 124 step staircase leading to the main entrance on one's knees would absolve a Catholic of all sins. Lord knows, I'd rather have murder on my knees than on my hands.<br><br>Some historians postulate the Basilica was built atop the ruins of Juno's temple. I have a feeling there's more to this building than meets the eye so I'd suggest paying close attention to this one.

Id: [0x0004CC05]
THE PANTHEON

Id: [0x0004CC06]
This architectural wonder still stands as the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome two thousand years after being built. The opening at the dome's centre (known as an Oculus) is the singular source of light for the immense chamber. <br><br>Constructed in 126 C.E. by Marcus Agrippa as a temple to all the Ancient Roman gods, the Pantheon has since become a beacon of Christianity. The structure has been burned, rebuilt, robbed, modified, torn down and renovated so many times the interior contains a myriad of conflicting icons and symbols. Apparently, most gods had this building constructed in their honour. I, however, recommend worshipping at the modern-day espresso bars surrounding it.

Id: [0x0004CC07]
MAUSOLEO DI AUGUSTO

Id: [0x0004CC08]
If you were anyone of importance in Rome and died between 24 B.C.E. and 98 C.E. you were buried in here. Occupied by the Colonna family in the Middle Ages, the Mausoleo was fortified and converted into part of the Castel Sant'Angelo. Yes, they lived with dead people. <br><br>After the humiliating defeat of the Commune of Rome in 1167, the Colonna family was disgraced, banished from the city and their fortification was dismantled. Later, the family was allowed back into Rome and spent the duration of the Renaissance feuding with the rival Orsini family. If this teaches us anything, it's that if you want to get rid of someone, hang them, because banishment is far too temporary.

Id: [0x0004CC09]
COLOSSEO

Id: [0x0004CC0A]
Constructed from 72-80 C.E. under Emperor Titus, the Colosseo held up to 50,000 spectators and is considered one of the greatest architectural achievements in Roman history. The majority of the shows, be they gladiatorial, dramatic or otherwise, were privately funded by rich families to demonstrate their opulence, creating spectacles that were universally adored by the people of Rome. Unfortunately, a massive earthquake in 1349 caused large-scale irreparable damage and the Colosseo was left to ruin. <br><br>In the mid-16th century, Pope Sixtus V wished to make use of the remaining shell and resolved to convert the structure into a giant wool factory to provide employment for Rome's prostitutes. Sadly, the Pope died before his brilliant idea could become a reality.

Id: [0x0004CC0B]
MERCATI DI TRAIANO

Id: [0x0004CC0C]
A fine example of the many enduring landmarks left behind by prolific Roman builder, Emperor Trajan. His Mercati is thought to be the world's oldest shopping mall and when fully operational it housed no less than 150 shops and offices. <br><br>Designed by Trajan's favourite architect, Apollodorus of Damascus between 107 and 110 C.E. it was considered one of the wonders of the ancient world over, say, a 91 mile long aqueduct providing the whole city with clean water. No, the shopping mall is far more impressive.

Id: [0x0004CC0F]
PIRAMIDE CESTIA

Id: [0x0004CC10]
This giant tomb was built between 18 and 12 B.C.E. for Caius Cestius who was both a magistrate and member of the Roman religious corporation known as Septemviri Epulonum, which was in charge of creating religious feasts for the gods, and distributing swag during parties. During the construction of the Aurelian Walls between 271 and 275, the pyramid was built into the bulwark, forming a triangular bastion in an effort to cut costs on the snowballing wall project. <br><br>You'll notice the faces of the pyramid are far steeper than its Egyptian ancestors. This is attributed to erroneous sketches of the Egyptian pyramids which acted as the chief reference for its construction.

Id: [0x0004CC13]
ARCO DI COSTANTINO

Id: [0x0004CC14]
It's widely accepted that Emperor Constantine I had an insatiable thirst for gloating. So, when he defeated Emperor Maxentius and took the throne in 312, no one was surprised when he built this arch to commemorate his victory. Most of the artwork on the arch was plundered from existing monuments and modified to alter its meaning. <br><br>Some historians contend that the artisans of the 4th century simply didn't have the talent to create such ornate pieces, and only completed the arch by recycling old master works from ruins around the city. A preposterous claim, as the Romans never copied anything. <br><br>See what I did there? Sarcasm.

Id: [0x0004CC15]
ARCO DI TITO

Id: [0x0004CC16]
Built by Emperor Domitian in 82 C.E. to honour his dead brother Titus, the Arco di Tito commemorates Titus's victory in the Sack of Jerusalem. This arch became the inspiration for many arches to be erected thereafter, most notably the Arc de Triomphe in Paris as well as Constantine's Arch.

Id: [0x0004CC19]
TEMPIO DI SATURNO

Id: [0x0004CC1A]
A monument to the agricultural deity Saturn, this temple stands at the western end of the Roman Forum. Also known as the Aerarium, the Roman national treasure was kept here along with the Republic's reserves of gold and silver. Like the Temple of Castor and Pollux, it at one time housed the official scales. From this, one might be able to surmise that Saturn was not only rich but likely had an eating disorder.

Id: [0x0004CC1F]
TEMPIO DI ANTONINO E FAUSTINA

Id: [0x0004CC20]
Standing proudly among its brethren in the Roman Forum, the Tempio di Antonino e Faustina was originally erected in honour of the deceased wife of Emperor Antonius Pius, Faustina the Elder. 20 years after its inauguration, Antonius Pius also passed away and the temple was rededicated to both of them. <br><br>In the 11th century, the Catholic Church decided to make use of the ruins and converted them into the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda, which you see now.

Id: [0x0004CC23]
TEMPIO DI VESPASIANO

Id: [0x0004CC24]
Standing at the western end of the Roman Forum between the Temple of Concordia and the Temple of Saturn, the Tempio was built to honour the Flavian Dynasty, comprised of emperors Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. As part of the deification process, construction was ordered by Titus shortly after his father Vespasian's death in 79. Legend tells us Vespasian's last words were: "Pity, I think I'm turning into a god." Which, incidentally, will also be my last words.

Id: [0x0004CC29]
BASILICA EMILIA

Id: [0x0004CC2A]
Destroyed when the Visigoths sacked Rome, clues for the Basilica's primary purpose were left behind. When the occupants fled, they dropped coins which remained on the tile floor as the building was set aflame. After the smoke cleared and the attack was over, the coins had been welded to the basilica floor from the extreme heat. So, It seems its main function was as offices for money lenders and tax collectors, or even, perhaps, pre-pubescent coin collectors.

Id: [0x0004CC2B]
BASILICA GIULIA

Id: [0x0004CC2C]
Initially dedicated by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C.E., the Basilica's construction was funded by the spoils of the Gallic War. Completed some years later by Augustus, he named the building after his father. It was used mostly as a court of civil law as well as for sessions of the Centumviri who presided over matters of inheritance.

Id: [0x0004CC2D]
BASILICA DI MASSENZIO

Id: [0x0004CC2E]
This Basilica's construction began under Emperor Maxentius in 308, who was later defeated by Constantine in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. Constantine oversaw the building's completion through 312 and relished the satisfaction of completing Maxentius' project. <br><br>The Basilica was a multifunctional building used as a courthouse, council chamber and meeting hall. It borrowed pieces of its design from other basilicas and Roman baths, but taken as a whole, it is truly unique.

Id: [0x0004CC2F]
ARCO DI SETTIMIO SEVERO

Id: [0x0004CC30]
Standing at the foot of the Campidoglio in the Roman Forum, the Arco di Settimio Severo is a triumphal arch commemorating the Parthian victories of Emperor Septimius Severus. After Septimius died, his sons Caracalla and Geta shared rule as joint emperors. However, in 212, Caracalla had Geta assassinated and subsequently destroyed all records of Geta's existence including Geta's image and inscriptions on the arch. I guess a healthy sibling rivalry wasn't so healthy for Geta.

Id: [0x0004CC35]
COLONNA TRAIANA

Id: [0x0004CC36]
Another of Trajan's landmarks that still stands today; the Colonna Traiana was erected in memoriam of his victory in the Dacian Wars and was likely designed by Apollodorus, the most gifted architect in all of Rome. The column is most famous for its spiral bas relief encompassing the entire pillar which meticulously depicts the epic battles between the Romans and Dacians. <br><br>A spiral staircase within the structure leads to a platform that would have given a visitor of the time a magnificent view of the surrounding forum. Spiral staircases, which had been rare previously, became a symbol of imperial power after that, leading to all kinds of suggestive comments like: "let me see your staircase".

Id: [0x0004CC37]
ACQUA VERGENE

Id: [0x0004CC38]
Named partially for the virgin waters that flow through its channels and a myth that thirty Roman soldiers asking for water were led by a beautiful young girl to the source springs (how they knew she was a virgin is pretty self-evident) , the Acqua Vergene is the most famous water source in Rome. Its springs provide the Trevi Fountain, the Villa Borghese, the north and south fountains of the Piazza Navona and the fountains of Piazza del Popolo with their water, none of which you will get to see, because they were all built in the mid-16th century. <br><br>Considered to be some of the best drinking water in the world, Romans and visitors line up to fill containers from the fountains, although after a 2007 construction accident that halted the Vergene's flow temporarily, and the chemical cocktail distilled daily in the Trevi Fountain to keep it clean, I'd stick to tea.

Id: [0x0004CC39]
CIRCO MASSIMO

Id: [0x0004CC3A]
Located in the valley between Aventino and Colle Palatino, this ancient Roman chariot racing stadium was not only the first of its kind but also the largest. At its peak, the Circo could hold 250,000 people, which was roughly one quarter of the city's population. In 140 C.E. one of the upper tiers of the circus collapsed and killed 1,112 spectators. This tragedy has stood the test of time and remains the worst sports-related disaster in history, not England vs. Hungary in 1953, as some people would like to believe. I'm looking at you, Dad.

Id: [0x0004CC3B]
COLLE PALATINO

Id: [0x0004CC3C]
Of the Seven Hills in Rome, the Colle Palatino is the centremost in reference to the city. One of the oldest sectors of Rome, it looks down upon both the Roman Forum and the Circo Massimo. <br><br>According to some of my favourite Roman mythology, the hill was the location of the cave known as Lupercal where Romulus and Remus were found and kept alive by the she-wolf. <br><br>Which, not-so-coincidentally, is the name we gave to my ex in the Hastings household. Don't ask.

Id: [0x0004CC3D]
AVENTINO

Id: [0x0004CC3E]
Another one of the Seven Hills of Rome upon which the ancient city was built, Aventino was mainly a suburb during the monarchy and early Republic. In 456 B.C.E., a law was passed allowing plebeians to own property on the hill, causing the city to quickly grow beyond its walls. This rapid expansion made it far more vulnerable to capture by the Gauls. Only after a bloody invasion, the Senate passed a motion to build a new wall encircling Aventino, a delayed reaction strikingly similar to that found before the passage of health care reform in the U.S.

Id: [0x0004CC3F]
CELIO

Id: [0x0004CC40]
Named for Caelius Vibenna, it's unclear whether he received the honour for settling the hill or if his friend Servius Tullius merely wanted to commemorate him posthumously. Either way, as one of the Seven Hills of Rome, Celio was a fashionable residential district for the wealthy during the Republican era of Rome.

Id: [0x0004CC41]
ESQUILINO

Id: [0x0004CC42]
The southern most of the Seven Hills of Rome, Esquilino was another fashionable residential district. In a demonstration of humility and graciousness, Nero confiscated property here to build his opulent Golden House which was, to put it mildly, excessive.

Id: [0x0004CC43]
IL CAMPIDOGLIO

Id: [0x0004CC44]
The most famous of the Seven Hills of Rome, il Campidoglio's ancient history yields layers of ruins steeped in mythology. Several important Roman temples were built atop the hill including the Temple of Juno, the Temple of Virtus and the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Capitolinus. In 79, the hill was also home to the Tabularium, the Empire's main archive. In the Middle Ages, it became the city's centre of civic government just before receiving a face lift from Michelangelo.

Id: [0x0004CC45]
COLLE QUIRINALE

Id: [0x0004CC46]
Situated north-east of the city centre, Quirinale is one of the Seven Hills of Rome. Tombs from the 8th and 7th century B.C.E. have been found here, confirming theories of its existence as a Sabine settlement before being assimilated by Rome. Constantine I had his lavish private baths built here as well, although all that remain are a few drawings.

Id: [0x0004CC47]
COLLE VIMINALE

Id: [0x0004CC48]
The smallest of the Seven Hills of Rome, Viminale is shaped like a little finger pointing towards the central city. At the top stands the palace of Viminale which is the office of the Ministry of Interior. This little hill was also home to the Terme di Diocleziano, which were renowned as the grandest of the public baths.

Id: [0x0004CC49]
TERME DI TRAIANO

Id: [0x0004CC4A]
As with many of Trajan's projects, it's believed this massive leisure and bath-house was designed by Apollodorus. The structure was built atop a section of Nero's ruined Golden Palace, and was poetically intended for use by the commoners. In 537, the Siege of the Goths destroyed most of the Roman aqueducts and the Terme di Traiano were subsequently abandoned due to the loss of their water supply. Another public works project gone terribly wrong, but I'm sure throwing a few Christians to the lions in the Colosseo made up for it!

Id: [0x0004CC4B]
TERME DI CARACALLA

Id: [0x0004CC4C]
Built between 212 and 216 during the reign of Emperor Caracalla, these public baths remained in use until the mid-6th century. The process of bathing was an elaborate one. A typical Roman male began in the hot bath, moved to a tepid bath, jumped into cold water and then finished in an outdoor pool, all of which allowed the older men visiting the baths ample time for ogling.<br><br>Caracalla had more than just water sports, the larger leisure complex housed an extensive library with equal amounts of Greek and Latin text as well as an extensive gymnasium. In 537, the Baths were sacked by the Goths, and had their hydraulic instillations destroyed, rendering them useless.

Id: [0x0004CC4D]
TERME DI DIOCLEZIANO

Id: [0x0004CC4E]
Perched atop Viminale Hill, the Terme di Diocleziano were the most lavish of all imperial baths built during the height of the Roman Empire. Like the rest, they remained operational until the Goths cut the Roman water supply in 537. <br><br>After that, much of the structures were converted into various different spaces, i.e. places of worship, commissioned by the Roman Catholic Church and today they house a collection of funeral art. Just goes to show you, rest and relaxation lead to sin and death...or, maybe, that if you fill up a tomb with water, it makes a brilliant swimming pool.

Id: [0x0004CC4F]
CASTRA PRAETORIA

Id: [0x0004CC50]
The Castra functioned as the ancient barracks for the Praetorian Guard of Imperial Rome. After Constantine's victory over Maxentius in 312, he destroyed the barracks. Although the Guard had been the Emperor's protectors for centuries and were simply doing their job defending Maxentius, it appears Constantine was unable to forgive them. They were disbanded forever. <br><br>Talk about a bad day at work.

Id: [0x0004CC51]
PIAZZA DEL POPOLO

Id: [0x0004CC52]
The future site of the famous Piazza del Popolo, in the early 15th century, the Piazza was merely the continuation of the Via Flaminia. As a result, it was most travellers' first view of Rome upon arrival. <br><br>The powers that be eventually decided they'd rather the first impression of Rome be a little more impressive than a muddy expanse, so they set about building the beautiful square it is today.

Id: [0x0004CC53]
PIAZZA DI SPAGNA

Id: [0x0004CC54]
The future site of the famously peculiar Piazza di Spagna, this public expanse at the foot of the Spanish Steps is shaped as an elongated triangle rather than a square. Named after the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See, the Piazza became one of Rome's most popular meeting places. <br><br>Notably, the Romantic poet John Keats spent his final hours in a flat overlooking the Piazza. A thing of beauty is a joy forever...except when you're about to die of TB.

Id: [0x0004CC55]
PIAZZA NAVONA

Id: [0x0004CC56]
This piazza was built on the site of the Stadium of Domitian, which was constructed during the 1st century. At the southwest end, stands the ancient speaking statue of Pasquino. Unearthed and erected in the Piazza in 1501, the statue was used by citizens as a sign post for social parodies and anonymous derogatory comments, which were attached to it for all to read. A truly ingenious concept, in my opinion.

Enclosing all the Seven Hills of Rome, this line of city walls was built during the reigns of Emperor Aurelian and Emperor Probus from 271 to 275. It served as a deterrent against raiding clans of barbarians who liked to strike poorly defended suburbs and villages. In 545, during the Gothic War, Totila, King of the Ostrogoths, destroyed much of the walls in an attempt to reduce the Byzantines' ability to defend the city. <br><br>And that's what's wrong with Goths today: too much makeup, not enough village razing.

ACQUA MARCIA

Id: [0x0004CC5A]
This impressive system was the longest of the 11 Roman aqueducts, running a staggering 91 miles. Built between 144-140 B.C.E., the aqueduct was named for its creator, praetor Qunitus Marcius Rex. <br><br>It was maintained and even expanded for the better part of 200 years, but, typical of any free public service, by Nero's reign so many people siphoned water out of it for personal use the flow was barely a trickle by the time it arrived in the city.

Id: [0x0004CC5B]
ACQUEDOTTO CLAUDIA

Id: [0x0004CC5C]
One of the ancient aqueducts that supplied the city, at its peak the Acquedotto Claudia was able to provide all 14 districts with water. The hugely relied upon source inexplicably went dry for nine years right around the time Nero was building his modest Golden Palace. His little pet project required vast amounts of water but, luckily, the main build site was at the foot of Claudia's castellum (or storage reservoir). When the palace was completed the water conveniently came back. To this day historians are baffled as to what caused the drought. My bet: dramatic tension.

Id: [0x0004CC5D]
ACQUA ANTONINIANA

Id: [0x0004CC5E]
Built by Caracalla in 212, the Antoniniana was a secondary channel of the Marcia designed exclusively to supply water to Caracalla's private baths. Thanks to several repairs by various popes the Antoniniana remained functional far longer than its counterparts and well into the 10th century, at which point it was supplied for several hundred more years solely by the tears of peasants.

PORTA AURELIA

Id: [0x0004CC60]
This gate of the Mura Aurelianel resides on the summit of the Janiculum and was the starting point of the Via Aurelia. Renamed Porta San Pancrazio after Pope Urban VIII remodelled it in the 17th century, the Via Aurelia served as Rome's connection to France during the Republic and Middle Ages and therefore was extremely important for trade.

Id: [0x0004CC61]
PORTA SETTIMIANA

Id: [0x0004CC62]
In the Middle Ages, the Via Recta left through this gate leading to the Tevere (Tiber River) port in Trastevere. It was restored at the beginning of the 15th century and again in 1498 when Pope Alexander VI wanted to give it a more military feel, right before Cesare marched out of the Vatican to attack Romagna and the Villa Auditore.

Id: [0x0004CC63]
PORTA FLAMINIA

Id: [0x0004CC64]
This gate was originally the starting point for the Via Flaminia leading to Ariminum, making it the most important road to the north of Rome. It eventually became the Porta del Popolo granting access to the famous Piazza del Popolo.

Id: [0x0004CC65]
PORTA PINCIANA

Id: [0x0004CC66]
Built in the early 5th century by Honorius, who adapted a previously existing service entrance, this gate marked the start of the Via Salaria. A legend during the Middle Ages claimed that Roman general Belisarius, who defended Rome against the Ostrogoths, was seen here as a blinded beggar. <br><br>Emperor Justinian, when questioned about his involvement in the blinding, denied it, then abruptly began talking about rebuilding the Hagia Sophia.

Id: [0x0004CC67]
PORTA SALARIA

Id: [0x0004CC68]
The Goth king Alaric I entered Rome through this Aurelian gate to begin his 410 Sack of Rome. Unlike most of its counterparts, the Porta Salaria didn't receive a Christian name during the Middle Ages, perhaps as punishment for its failure.

Id: [0x0004CC69]
PORTA NOMENTANA

Id: [0x0004CC6A]
One of the minor Mura Aureliane (Aurelian Wall) gates, Porta Nomentana was originally constructed as a single arch entrance. The Porta was flanked by two semi-circular towers, one of which was converted to a tomb for a man by the name of Quintus Aterius. Quintus was said to have been "a man made rotten by flattery". But history had the last laugh, the gate is now incorporated into the wall of the British Embassy. His dead ears will never hear flattery again.

Id: [0x0004CC6B]
PORTA CLAUSA

Id: [0x0004CC6C]
Another of the minor gates in the Mura Aureliane (Aurelian Wall), the Porta Clausa was mostly used as a service entrance. Due to its historical insignificance, city officials eventually blocked the gate and left it to ruin. Sound familiar, taxpayers?

Id: [0x0004CC6D]
PORTA TIBURTINA

Id: [0x0004CC6E]
This gate, adorned with lovely bull skulls, was originally an arch built by Emperor Augustus at the point where three separate aqueducts passed over the Via Tiburtina. Later, when the Mura Aureliane (Aurelian Walls) were being built, engineers decided to incorporate the arch to save money and time.

Id: [0x0004CC6F]
PORTA PRAENESTINA

Id: [0x0004CC70]
Like the Porta Tiburtina, this gate was originally built to support aqueducts, namely the Acqua Claudius and the Acqua Anio Novous, both of which crossed two arterial roads of Rome. The Porta was later incorporated into the Mura Aureliane (Aurelian Walls) in an effort to expedite the project. Several bodies can also be found entombed in the walls, another famous Italian money-saving device.

Id: [0x0004CC71]
PORTA ASINARIA

Id: [0x0004CC72]
The Porta Asinaria was built as a part of the original Mura Aureliane (Aurelian Walls), its unique tower blocks and guard rooms cause it to stand out from the rest. In 536, General Belisarius led his troops through this gate to retake Rome from the Ostrogoths. Its glory was, however, short lived when, 10 years later, traitors opened this gate to let Totila and his Goths back in to raid the city for a second time. <br><br>Belisarius should have remembered to double lock it!

Id: [0x0004CC73]
PORTA METRONIA

Id: [0x0004CC74]
Built in conjunction with the Mura Aureliane (Aurelian Walls), the Porta Metronia was sealed at the end of the Middle Ages, allowing Pope Callixtus II to create a small channel through it for the Acqua Mariana, a river whose stagnant waters would later cause an outbreak in 1601. <br><br>Good deed + passage of time = plague. That's the circle of life.

Id: [0x0004CC75]
PORTA APPIA

Id: [0x0004CC76]
A south-easterly entrance to Rome, Porta Appia was one of the largest and most important gates to the city. As a result, it received two separate fortifications and renovations in its early life. From here, the Via Appia heads south through Italy.

Id: [0x0004CC77]
PORTA OSTIENSE

Id: [0x0004CC78]
Located just west of the Pyramid of Cestius along the Mura Aureliane, this gate has a similar history to the Porta Asinaria. In 549, the treason of the Isaurian garrison allowed Totila and his Ostrogoths to enter Rome via this gate and sack the city. I think the Romans should have amended their guard screening exam, adding one key question: are you friends with King Totila?

Id: [0x0004CC79]
PORTA TURRIONIS

Id: [0x0004CC7A]
Constructed sometime between 848 and 1455 (come on fellow historians, I can drive more than three times the age of the U.S. through that gap), the Porta Turrionis was so named because it stood next to a tower (turrionis) built by Pope Nicholas V. Speaking of driving, the location of the gate at the entrance to the Vatican was enlarged for cars in 1990, and the original was moved several metres to the side and permanently closed, which might lead one to ask the important philosophical question: "Which gate is the real Porta Turrionis?", except the Pope renamed it the Porta Cavalleggeri, rendering the question utterly pointless and nonsensical.

Id: [0x0004CC7B]
PORTA VIRIDARIA

Id: [0x0004CC7C]
Porta Viridaria, also known by the names Porta San Petri, Porta di Belvedere, Porta San Pellegrino, Porta Palatina, Porta Aurea, Porta San Peregrini and Porta Enoughalready, is one of the oldest gates in the walls surrounding the Vatican. It opens into Leonine City, or the Borgo, an independent municipality that sits at the entrance to the Vatican. Both were enclosed by the Leonine Walls in 852 to defend against invaders. <br><br>Once built, the Porta Virdaria became the primary entrance to the Vatican from the north, welcoming the crushing influx of pilgrims each Jubilee that continues to send real estate and hotel prices skyrocking. <br><br>The gate was rendered unnecessary in 1563, when the third set of Leonine Walls were constructed, enclosing the existing set.

PONTE CESTIO

Id: [0x0004CC7E]
Exactly who built this particular bridge is unknown, but we do know it was the first to connect the right bank of the Tevere to Isola Tiberina. In ancient times the river had great religious significance and it was considered a breach of divine law to build a bridge across it. The only person who could approve such a project was the High Priest or "Pontifice," which literally translates to "bridge builder"'. How bridge builders eventually acquired the power to divide up the New World is another story.

Id: [0x0004CC7F]
PONTE EMILIO

Id: [0x0004CC80]
A single arch mid-river is all that now remains of the oldest Roman bridge in the city. It remained functional until 1598, when a flood swept away the eastern arch and city officials deemed it too expensive to fix, as all money was heading into Pope Clement VIII's execution fund.

Id: [0x0004CC81]
PONTE SISTO

Id: [0x0004CC82]
The current incarnation was built by Pope Sixtus IV between 1473 and 1479 as a replacement for its predecessor, Pons Aurelius. What sets this bridge apart from the rest is its central stylized occulus, which I think looks quite sharp.

Id: [0x0004CC83]
PONTE SANT'ANGELO

Id: [0x0004CC84]
This bridge was built to cross the Tevere from the city centre to Hadrian's freshly completed mausoleum which later became the Castel Sant'Angelo. In 1450, its balustrades buckled due a surging mob of pilgrims making their way to the Basilica San Pietro, leading to a mass drowning. Later, in the 16th century, the structure was used to display the bodies of executed men to the public. Is it just me, or was this bridge not particularly cheery?

Id: [0x0004CC85]
CASERMA DI ALVIANO

Id: [0x0004CC86]
Used by Bartolomeo until 1503, his barracks became a training ground for mercenaries until they fell into disrepair and were levelled to make way for the enlarging city. The spot was marked for a memorial in 1960, but no one was quite sure where the barracks were actually located, so the idea was scrapped in favour of a park, which was, in turn, scrapped in favor of a fast food restaurant.

Id: [0x0004CC87]
LA VOLPE ADDORMENTATA

Id: [0x0004CC88]
Popular among the Borgia guards for the free drinks served nightly, La Volpe Addormentata guaranteed a good time had by all. And the patrons must have always felt a little lighter leaving than they did coming in, judging from the abnormally high reports of stolen items.

Id: [0x0004CC89]
NERO'S GOLDEN PALACE

Id: [0x0004CC8A]
Perhaps the best example of early Roman imperial machismo, Nero had this gaudy monstrosity built after the Great Fire of Rome. Thought to have been as big as 300 acres, this gilded and bejewelled palace contained vineyards, pastures with flocks, groves and a manmade lake. To top it off, Nero commissioned a 35 meter tall bronze statue of himself to be placed just outside the main entrance reassuring any doubters as to who exactly owned the building. <br><br>The Palace was known as a party villa considering there were over 300 rooms, none of which were sleeping quarters. The list of ridiculous extravagancies goes on forever, one standout being a mechanism, powered by slaves, that rotated the domed ceiling of the grand dining hall "as the heavens" while raining rose petals onto Nero's guests below.

Id: [0x0004CC8B]
TORRE MILIZIE

Id: [0x0004CC8C]
This imposing mediaeval tower is annexed to Mercati di Traiano and is not only one of the oldest and most fortified towers in Rome but also qualifies as the tallest. You'll notice it tilting slightly due to an earthquake in 1348 that caused the top floor to crumble. Despite popular belief implicating Nero in its construction, the more probable reality points to Pope Innocent III as its commissioner. People just assumed Nero because it's big and gaudy. I can't blame them.<br><br>During the Renaissance, there were rumors of a treasure in the hard-to-reach upper levels, but no proof was ever found.

Id: [0x0004CC8D]
CLOACA MAXIMA

Id: [0x0004CC8E]
The name literally meaning "Great Sewer", the Cloaca Maxima was one of the world's first major sewage systems. Records suggest it was first built as early as 600 B.C.E. under order of King Tarquinius of Rome. Aside from taking sewage away from the city, it's widely accepted that the Cloaca was used to drain the once swampy location of the Roman Forum.<br><br>Surprisingly, it still remains in use today as a drainage system for excess rain water.<br><br>I bet you thought I would make a sewer joke, huh? Please. Too easy.

Id: [0x0004CC8F]
PALAZZO LATERANO

Id: [0x0004CC90]
Originally a palace during the Roman Empire, the Laterano was the home of the Laterani family who served as administrators for many Roman emperors. Eventually Constantine himself took control of the building when in a final act of juvenile dominance over his rival, he married Maxentius's sister, Fausta, who possessed the deed at the time. I wonder if Maxentius got the message? <br><br>In the 4th century, the Laterno became the principal Papal residence, but lost favour after two fires in 1307 and 1361.

Id: [0x0004CC91]
TIVOLI

Id: [0x0004CC92]
This ancient town sits nestled in the Sabine hills about 30 kilometres from Rome offering spectacular views of the stunning Roman Campagna. In about 361 B.C.E. Tivoli, or then referred to as Tibur, allied itself with the Gauls. They remained peaceful for 23 years until the Romans defeated the Gauls and absorbed the village. In 90 B.C.E., the city received official Roman citizenship and became a resort destination for the Roman elite who travelled there for its beauty and superb water. <br><br>In 1461, Pope Pius II built the Rocca Pia in an attempt to control the population which often rioted. The fortress stood as a symbol of the omnipotence of the papal temporal power. <br><br>During the Renaissance, Tivoli had several open-air travertine mines, excavating stone for the palazzos and courtyards of Rome. It was rumored that an ancient Roman treasure was buried in one, but treasure hunters, with their metal detectors beeping forlornly, have returned disappointed.

Id: [0x0004CC93]
SANTA MARIA IN VALLICELLA

Id: [0x0004CC94]
What you're looking at now is the first church built on this site by Pope Gregory I, a modest structure dedicated to Santa Maria in Vallicella. In 1575, construction of the world renowned cathedral got underway, which was eventually finished and consecrated in 1599.

Id: [0x0004CC95]
SAN ANDREA DELLA VALLE

Id: [0x0004CC96]
This is the future site of the fabled Basilica di Sant'Andrea Della Valle although construction won't start for another 80 or so years. The land was bequeathed to the Duchess of Amalfi who herself was a descendant of Pope Pius II. She was then charged by the order of Theatine with the responsibility of erecting a church in honour of Saint Andrew. <br><br>Although she did not live to see it completed in 1650, the final product was something to behold, celebrated the world over for its stunning interior.

Id: [0x0004CC97]
SAN GIOVANNI DEI FIORENTINI

Id: [0x0004CC98]
Once completed, San Giovanni became the national church of Florence in Rome. Pope Leo X initiated an architectural competition in 1508 for a new church to be built in place of the old Saint Pantaleo. The winning architect went by the name of Sansovino but there were complications and construction slowly ground to a halt. Many different people tried to finish the church over two centuries, and it was finally completed in 1734. <br><br>There's something to be said for the efficiency of a dictatorship, although the death toll accompanying one is a little unsettling.

Id: [0x0004CC99]
SANTA MARIA DEI MIRACOLI AND SANTA MARIA DI MONTESANT

Id: [0x0004CC9A]
This modest church initially housed humble Carmelite monks who are probably in there right now, hiding from the outside world.<br><br>Eventually it was converted into one of the twin churches that stand on the edge of the present day Piazza del Popolo. The renovations took 13 years starting in 1662. The resulting structures have become iconic landmarks in modern day Rome.

Id: [0x0004CC9B]
TRINITA DEI MONTI

Id: [0x0004CC9C]
Best known for presiding over the Spanish Steps which lead down into the Piazza di Spagna, construction of this church was completed in the early 1500s. Both the building and surrounding areas are property of the French state who commissioned the project in celebration of their successful invasion of Naples. <br><br>A very short-lived victory.

Id: [0x0004CC9D]
SANT'ANTONIO DEI PORTOGHESI

Id: [0x0004CC9E]
This church was erected between 1440 and 1445 by Cardinal Antonio de Chavez and was annexed to the hospice for Portuguese pilgrims. In 1638, a massive face lift was begun at the hands of Martino Longhi the Younger, converting it to the national church of the Portuguese people.

Id: [0x0004CC9F]
SANTI APOSTOLI

Id: [0x0004CCA0]
This early Roman Catholic building was built by Pope Pelagius I to celebrate Narses victory over the Ostrogoths. Like many other structures it suffered severe damage from the great earthquake of 1348. It was restored in 1417 by Pope Martin V and later again by Pope Clement XI.

ROMA

Id: [0x0004CCAA]
Evidence suggests a human presence in the area of Rome for at least 10,000 years. The mythology of early Rome tells us that the city was founded by Romulus who was raised in a cave with his brother Remus by a she-wolf. Apparently, the two infant boys took their nourishment from her teat (a story like that must be true, right?). <br><br>Archaeological evidence supports that Rome did in fact grow from pastoral settlements on Colle Palatino, the future site of the Roman Forum, upon which there are several caves. Eventually, the Republic of Rome was founded in c. 510 B.C.E. The successful and wealthy Republic gave birth to the imperial Roman Empires c. 27 B.C.E., which were sprawling territories ruled by succeeding emperors. <br><br>When the empire fell in 476, and the Roman Catholic Church took power in 756, Rome continued to be both an economic and cultural powerhouse in Europe. In the mid-14th century, Florence surpassed Rome as the epicentre of the Italian Renaissance. This irked the papacy to no end so they set about spending vast amounts of money and resources, commissioning architects and artists to create masterworks in an effort to bring the focus back to Rome. <br><br>The result of this vanity driven ambition was an unmatched creative and scientific output that is still marvelled over today. It's safe to say that Rome is, historically, one of the most important cities in western history and, arguably, the world.

ROSA IN FIORE

Id: [0x0004CCAC]
Founded in 1480, the Rosa in Fiore was known for its preferential treatment for members of the Vatican: the higher the rank, the more women allowed in the room at once. Madonna Solari, the first proprietor, developed a close friendship with several cardinals, eventually taking bribes for information about the Assassins.<br><br>Apparently, she outlived her usefulness. <br><br>Once Claudia took over, members of the clergy came in more often than they ever did before. And Claudia had ways of making them talk. Wait, that went down wrong, I meant to write, she was very persuasive. That's wrong too. She had a way with words...Descriptive words. Oh, forget it.

CASTEL DELL'OVO

Id: [0x0004CCB2]
A medieval castle located on the former island of Megaride, the Castel Dell'Ovo is named for a legendary Roman poet who was believed to be a great sorcerer. Legend tells us that he placed a magical egg in the structure's foundation to support it. <br><br>The original edifice was a fortified villa where the last Roman Emperor, Romulus Augustus, was exiled in 476. Some contend Romulus acquired a strong distaste for omelettes during his stay there. <br><br>I wonder why?

Id: [0x0004CCB3]
PORTO DI NAPOLI

Id: [0x0004CCB4]
Located directly to the east of Castel Nuovo, the Porto di Napoli has always been a center of commerce for the city. The Porto's history reaches as far back as the Greeks, who first settled Napoli in the 9th century B.C.E. <br><br>As the city grew, the harbour's roll in European trade followed suit.

MONTE VESUVIO

Id: [0x0004CCB6]
Arguably one of the most fabled volcanoes in history, Vesuvio destroyed both Pompeii and Herculaneum when it erupted in 79 C.E., both of which were never rebuilt. Since that catastrophe, the sleeping monster has erupted three dozen times. It's still considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the worl, as over 3 million people live within range of a major eruption. I hear property is cheap right now, maybe we should invest.

NAPOLI

Id: [0x0004CCB8]
More than 2,800-years-old, Napoli (or Naples) has a deep and rich history, its roots lying in a Greek settlement founded during the 8th century B.C.E. Control of the city changed hands numerous times throughout its existence and for a period bounced back and forth between the Goths and Romans. In one famous account, the Byzantine Romans retook the city by entering on its aqueduct and bypassing the heavily guarded gates.<br><br>In the Middle Ages, the Normans took control and stayed in power for 300 years while their leaders and nobles feuded over who the rightful ruler was. Following their reign, control of the prosperous merchant city shifted between a host of city states and countries including France and Spain.<br><br>French rule began in 1501 under Louis XII. French control, however, only lasted until 1505, when Ferdinand seized power in the name of Spain. During this time, Naples became one Europe's biggest cities, second only to Paris, as well as a cultural powerhouse of the Renaissance boasting artists like Laurana, de Messina and Poliziano.

VIANA

Id: [0x0004CCBA]
I suppose you want to know how Cesare got here. I'll indulge you. <br><br>It was 1506. He was imprisoned in Castile. A sympathetic count smuggled in a rope, Cesare climbed out the window and dropped 70 feet, fracturing several bones, but his fall was broken by a servant who preceded him. Both the servant's legs were snapped and he was left to be captured and executed. Cesare escaped in merchant's clothing and chartered a small ship in Santander. He reached Navarre, the court of his brother-in-law. At the time, Navarre was dealing with upheavals secretly led by the Castilians. The King asked Cesare to command his army of 10,000. He was to retake Viana Castle from the Count of Lerin and the Castilians aiding him.<br><br>Excitedly, he wrote a letter to Lucrezia: "Once the Castle has been pacified, I will regain the support of the French and march back into Rome".

CASTEL VIANA

Id: [0x0004CCBC]
A large fortified palace in Viana held by Louis de Beaumont and besieged by Cesare Borgia's army of some 10,000 men. The castle was an extremely strong natural fortification and essentially impenetrable at the time. As a result, Cesare besieged the castle to weaken the forces inside, counting on a desperate surprise attack. He got his wish.

NICCOLÒ COPERNICO

Id: [0x0004CCDC]
Date of Birth: 1473.<br>Profession: Astronomer.<br><br>Born in the city of Toruń, Royal Prussia (which was actually a part of Poland and should not be confused with Ducal Prussia, Teutonic Prussia or the much later West Prussia), Niccolò Copernico, a.k.a. Nicolaus Copernicus, was the youngest of four siblings. Although he seemed to be destined for the Church, his brother was a priest and his sister a nun after all, Niccolò bucked the family trend…to partake in a humanist education to become a priest. Okay, so at first he wasn't much of a rebel, instead enjoying the privileges granted by his upper class upbringing, he studied Aristotle, Ptolemy and others at the University of Krakow. <br><br>By the time he graduated, he spoke four languages, and, while waiting to be appointed to his canonry in Warmia (a rebellious duchy within Poland) he journeyed to Italy to study law. However, rather than focusing on his canonical studies, he attended humanities lectures and began speaking about science and astronomy, notably leading a series of public lectures in Rome. Pope Alexander VI did not take kindly to him and he left the city rather abruptly in 1501. But Copernico had discovered his passion.<br><br>He was so enamoured with his studies, that he applied for a two year extension of his time abroad to learn medicine in Padua. While there, he also became fluent in Greek, and read many ancient texts.<br><br>After graduating, he left Italy for good, finally arriving in Warmia to take on his duties. Working as the secretary to his uncle, the Bishop of Warmia, he found time to develop his astronomical theories on the side. He quickly wrote a rough version of his heliocentric theory and then spent his off-hours for the next 30 years recording astral movements from an unknown tower using primitive instruments modelled on far more ancient ones. <br><br> Although Copernico has been immortalized for his writings placing the Sun at the centre of the universe, his theories were not published until just before his death in 1543. Some even believe he died as the first copy of his book was placed into his hands.

EGIDIO TROCHE

Id: [0x0004CCDE]
Date of Birth: 1436.<br>Profession: Senator.<br><br>The eldest of two brothers, Egidio was the son of a Senator who had the bad luck of following in his father's footsteps. Described as a naïve idealist in a letter from his brother, Francesco, Egidio attempted to bring back the era of the Roman commune when the Senate, the Conservatori, stood at the head of a democracy. Problem was, the Papacy wanted Rome all for itself.<br><br>As the century came to a close, the Pope seized control of Rome's urban planning, public works and finances, leaving the Conservatori with little more to do then plan festivals. Egidio, seeing his fellow Senators turn a blind eye as the Campidoglio slowly became a living museum, seems to have grown jaded: "Am I the only one in all of Rome who continues to seek freedom and justice?" he writes in a letter dated 1494. Records kept at the Rosa in Fiore indicate he began visiting regularly in 1495.<br><br>Meanwhile, Egidio's brother Francesco went to work for the Pope as his chamberlain and secretary, becoming good friends with Cesare, such good friends, in fact, that he was called "one of the Borgias' most trusted assassins." A letter sent to the Venetian ambassador by Egidio in 1503 detailing Cesare's war plans for the region reveals his hatred for the Cesare and his brother's inability to keep secrets while under the influence.

CESARE BORGIA

Id: [0x0004CCE4]
Date of Birth: 1475 or 1476.<br>Profession: Noble, Captain General of the Papal Forces.<br><br>Born to Rodrigo Borgia's mistress, Vannozza, Cesare studied law then became a cardinal when he was only eighteen. Meanwhile, his older brother Juan, Rodrigo's favorite, became the Captain General of the Papal forces. Cesare realized that his life as a cardinal would lead to a dead end; his brother was going to get everything. He knew exactly what he had to do. Juan had to go. <br><br>By 1499, Juan was dead and Cesare had become Captain General. He married a royal French bride, securing her title and an alliance with King Louis. With the aid of the King's forces, Cesare marched on Romagna. <br><br>His ruthless drive for power was unprecedented. Get this: when Cesare conquered Faenza he invited the much-beloved Lord of the city, the gallant seventeen-year-old Astorre III Manfredi, into his army. Astorre and Cesare really hit it off, but Astorre posed a threat to Cesare: he was Lord of Faenza due to his bloodline. So, when Cesare got back to Rome, he had both Astorre and his younger brother drowned by tying rocks to their feet and throwing them in the Tiber.<br><br>Cesare also proved to be a brilliant general. He seized the city of Urbino without a fight, through the help of the Pope. The plan was simple: the Pope requested a loan of artillery from the Duke, his supposed ally. Once the Duke had sent the artillery, Urbino was defenseless and Cesare invaded. <br><br>A cipher to all around him - at one point Isabella d'Este sent Cesare a hundred masks to congratulate him on a victory - Cesare's motivations were unreadable by his enemies and his actions notoriously brutal.

FABIO ORSINI

Id: [0x0004CCE6]
Date of Birth: 1476 or 1477.<br>Profession: Condottiero.<br><br>A condottiero from the fierce Orsini family, Fabio was already fighting by the age of eighteen, entering Montepulciano to help the Sienese. In 1498, he partnered with Bartolomeo d'Alviano against the Savelli, a rival family and joined the dark side, marrying Jeronima Borgia, a cousin of Lucrezia. At first, Fabio seems to help his new in-laws, but then, in 1499, while Cesare is in Romagna, he frees a friend imprisoned in the Tor di Nona, suggesting his allegiance to the Borgia may have been wavering. <br><br>Once his father Paolo was killed by Cesare, he "fled for prudence", then attacked Micheletto's army and lost, becoming an outlaw raiding the countryside. His notoriety put him on a list of bandits published by the Pope. <br><br>He continued to wage war for the rest of his short life, dying of a head wound after the battle of Garigliano in 1504.

FRANCESCO TROCHE

Id: [0x0004CCE8]
Date of Birth: 1459.<br>Profession: Chamberlain and Secretary to the Pope.<br><br>Senator Egidio Troche's younger brother, Francesco worked for the Vatican and was a trusted agent of the Pope. Among other things, he spied on Lucrezia while she was in the countryside and was sent to the French court to pressure King Louis to support her marriage to Alfonso d'Este (lucky husband number 3, Alfonso managed not to be humiliated or murdered, unlike Lucrezia's previous husbands). Cesare also spirited Francesco to France in 1502 to persuade Louis to abandon support for the Orsini family. <br><br>It seems after that they had a bit of a falling out. <br><br>As the cherry on the cake, after Micheletto strangled Francesco, Cesare found and killed a nobleman, Jacopo di Santa Croce, for no apparent reason. <br><br>Once Francesco's body was floating in the Tiber, Cesare issued a declaration calling for his arrest, claiming he had "fled Rome", an early instance of a savvy politician spinning a story for the press.

JUAN BORGIA THE ELDER

Id: [0x0004CCF2]
Date of Birth: 1446.<br>Profession: Cardinal, Cesare's Personal Financier.<br><br>The first of ten nephews elected to the cardinalship by Rodrigo Borgia, Juan sought out a privileged position in the Borgia court. He helped Cesare negotiate an allegiance with the Baron de Valois in 1499, impressing the young Captain General with his knowledge of French taste. <br><br>In an incident recorded by Bouchard, the Papal Master of Ceremonies, Juan and Cesare were seated, discussing financial matters, when a steward brought in a glass of wine. Juan took a sip, declared the wine to be false, accusing the astonished steward of drinking the real bottle. He then threw the wine over the steward and lit him on fire. Fortunately, the wine was not capable of igniting, but, unfortunately, the steward was still executed once the small fire was put out.<br><br>Such incidents must have impressed Cesare, as he shunned Rodrigo Borgia's banker Agostino Chigi, to invest with Juan. <br><br>Juan was gradually put in charge of Rome's finances. He used large amounts of the city's tax money to throw lavish parties for his friends, at one point tossing a hundred gold plates into the Tiber after their first use, outdoing Chigi, who had done the same with mere silver. Rome's citizens were also invited to the public areas of these parties, but many still complained privately that their money could be put to much better use.

LUCREZIA BORGIA

Id: [0x0004CCF4]
Date of Birth: 1480.<br>Profession: Noble, Daughter of the Pope.<br><br>Raised from childhood to be a pawn in her father's schemes, Lucrezia was married three times to serve the Pope's interests. The first marriage occurred when she was only thirteen, to Giovanni Sforza, to help further the Papal relationship with Milan, but when the Pope turned against Milan, he had no further use for the marriage. Cesare threatened to have Giovanni murdered, and he fled. In order to annul the marriage, the Pope ultimately had Giovanni declared impotent.<br><br>With that marriage deflated, the Pope was free to set up another one, this time to Alfonso of Aragon, cementing a partnership with Naples. Cesare hated the nineteen-year-old Alfonso for taking Lucrezia's attentions away from him and, in 1500, he stabbed Alfonso. Despite receiving several serious wounds, Alfonso didn't die. He miraculously recovered over the following weeks. Once he had done the impossible and risen from bed, Cesare instructed Micheletto to strangle him. Lucrezia was thrown out of the room and while she ran to the Pope to ask for help, Alfonso was murdered. Note: this was not the first time Cesare had killed a man connected to Lucrezia, he had drowned Pedro Calderon, the Papal Chamberlain, in 1498 for getting close to her.<br><br>Lucrezia's third husband, Alfonso d'Este, was very reluctant to marry her, understandably, but the Pope's strategy for central Italy required that he cement relations with Ferrara, so he paid Alfonso's father Ercole d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, 300,000 ducats along with other privileges to secure the match.<br><br>The two were married, but they weren't exclusive. Lucrezia slept with the poet Bembo and Francesco II Gonzaga. Their relationship ended when Francesco developed syphilis.<br><br>Lucrezia died from complications giving birth to her eighth child in 1519.<br><br>"What about those other seven children?" you may ask.

Date of Birth: 1476.<br>Profession: Wife.<br><br>Although she may look harmless, Pantasilea comes from a long line of fierce fighters. The Baglioni, rulers of Perugia, had been at war with the Oddi family for some time and skirmishes in the squares of the city became an almost daily occurrence. At one point the cathedral was used as a barracks. In 1500, during the marriage of Astorre Baglioni, the Oddi attacked, killing the groom and several others. The Baglioni counter-attacked and several of the Oddi were murdered. The marriage party became a massacre.<br><br>Pantasilea was a product of that rough environment; she was smart, unafraid and tough. And, unlike her husband, she had tact. <br><br>Pantasilea was known for sharp strategizing: "Whenever that girl encounters resistance, like the waters of the Tevere, she changes course until she has that for which she came. Now she has you, may you both be better for it", wrote Doge Agostino Barbarigo after learning of Bartolomeo and Pantasilea's marriage in 1498.

Unlike the theatre in other countries, Italian troops included women. The argument was that if men in the audience could be exposed to females with all their devilish charms, they would be prepared to resist them in person. Because that's why people go to the theatre, to learn to be more chaste…<br><br>Once in Rome, Pietro joined Cardinal Raffaele Riario's theatre, performing the Ancient Roman plays of Seneca, Plautus and Terence, although Classicism doesn't seemed to have cooled him down.

There isn't much about the Followers of Romulus in the history books, but from what I've found, they were a pagan cult operating in several abandoned locations underneath Rome. The cult worshipped the mythological founder of the city of Rome, Romulus, who was supposedly raised by wolves. The Followers believed that Romulus was part wolf and part man, which explains their retro wardrobe and bad table manners.

ARCHITECTS

Id: [0x0004CD08]
In contrast to the hard, geometric brutalism of Florentine architecture, Roman Renaissance architecture represented a true return to Classical proportion, with buildings that sported classical columns, structural elements and decorative forms, but also integrated new ideas from Florence, like the grand palazzo blocks. Although many of the architects in Rome came from up north, they were inspired by the old ruins, creating an interplay with the Ancient Roman structures throughout the city. Roman architects saw themselves as fulfilling all of human history, creating the essential expression of human will through the perfect cityscape. <br><br>Out of this tradition of formalized expression came the great Renaissance architects Bramante and Michelangelo.

Here's what I found: "A natural ally for the Borgia, Il Carnefice kills to the roar of an approving crowd." <br><br>The other small piece of information I could dig up is that he fancies himself as some sort of twisted artist.

Roughly 30 kilometres south of Rome, this small volcanic lake is named for the largest town in its vicinity, Nemi.

Some of the technology found on these ships was believed to have been invented only recently, including complex heating systems and plumbing for baths.

I have dropped to my knees, breath catching in my throat as I try to grasp the spectacle before me. This same cavern has haunted my dreams. I have spent countless nights exploring it in my sleep. I was compelled to find it.<br><br>I have decided. It is here that we will hold council. Here we will plot the downfall of our enemy, our friend, our dictator perpetuo. Forty of us, each a senator. Each a Liberatore. Cassius has tasked me with the plan, though I do not yet have one in mind.

Id: [0x0004D306]
The first council has ended. Our problem is clear, our response undetermined. Caesar moves away from the Senate, placing his  trust in foreign rulers, adopting the ego and pomp of his Egyptian whore. He refuses to rise when he addresses us and scoffs at our concerns. He has created his own private senate, filled with deceivers, manipulators, people who have no business in Roman affairs. My brothers are eager for blood, but I am not certain I can spill it.<br><br>After my brothers left, I continued to explore the cavern. I have found traces of whatever pulled me towards this place. Whispers. Lights flickering through cracks in the earth. A doorway that is also a puzzle. I must find the solution.

The door has opened! What lies inside has altered my perception and left me shaken, the very pillars of my beliefs toppled. Every event is a link in a chain, forged by something long dead. Or does it still live?<br><br>I calm myself and venture into the light. The ghosts howl inside my head, calling me forward. I have never seen architecture built to such a grand scale, lit by phantom radiance. Something lies at the center of the chamber, something powerful that I cannot reach. Surely Gods must have had a hand in its design, but which Gods?<br><br>A pedestal has emerged from the ground. I consider fleeing this madness, but I know it will draw me back. I rest my palm upon it and I am blinded! Filled by prophecy! I see Rome in flames and I am driven to action.<br><br>-  ZOOM TO SEE IMAGE DATA -

We meet in the cavern again, but I have hidden my discovery from my brothers. I relay my plan; some details are my own, but others driven by my visions. My contributions are practical: we will attack as a group to prevent escape and to ensure each of us is committed to this task. We will lure him to the Senate, where none of his allies may enter. The visions have shown me that we must strike on this day of Mars, that today my resolve will be tested and that I must not falter.<br><br>I am not a violent man, but I ready my family's heirloom dagger.

Caesar is dead, stabbed twenty-three times by his own countrymen, many of whom he once considered friends. Dead not for his deeds, but for fear of what he would have become. My own guilt has devoured me, for Caesar resigned himself to his harsh fate only once he met my eyes. Did he see what I had seen, reflected within them?<br><br>I, Marcus Junius Brutus, have returned to the cavern and the chamber below it. I have left behind my dagger and my armor. Perhaps one day another will be called here with for some similar, tragic purpose. Perhaps it is you, reading this account.<br><br>Despite my ordeal, I have no answers, but I suspect I will have them soon. For you who would enter the chamber, you must speak aloud-- <br><br>(The final piece of the scroll is missing.)

July 22, 1944<br><br>Fellows, rulers, welcome.<br><br>I deliver this speech to you as, several floors below us, a silent revolution begins.<br><br>Ranny Olds and Henry Ford. As many of you know, these founders gave us the assembly line, the device we have used to control both (those indoctrinated into the worship of our money (?) ) capitalists and workers (slaves (?) ) alike. But I dream of a future in which such ugly chains will no longer be necessary. In 1910, our founders designed the Plan, it falls to us to see it through.<br><br>But, what of the Communists, who intend to spread the bread so thin that everyone will starve? It is our duty to (neutralize (?) ) save them and their followers. We must ensure that they continue to eat, to reproduce, to be productive members of society. That is our burden, to shepherd those beneath us through life, and we must embrace it, even if (force is required (?) ) they themselves do not.<br><br>H. And S. brought on the turmoil and fear necessary, now we must strike fast to ensure development continues in the proper direction. We will appear to concede ground to the workers, remember the successful ruse of Rockefeller's dimes, but soon there will be no ground we do not own.<br><br>In 1937, we founded this Company, this enterprise, with a purpose. The time to nurture it to fruition is upon us.

A global international order must be implemented.<br><br>Re: Argentina<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell the Capitalists that if they help ensure the Junta remain in power, we will pass all their corporate debt on to the Argentine people. That will ensure they crush any popular revolt. I want the trade unions destroyed if we are to move forward.<br><br>Re: Chile<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free market must be allowed to prevail. F.’s visit last year helped things along, but now all public companies need to be sold to the private sector, ideally on the cheap. The price of bread and other staples must rise. I want to ensure the people remain marred in poverty and unable to resist.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any traces of this plan should appear to implicate the U.S. government. The Company's involvement must remain hidden.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For successful examples of a similar opening of the markets, look no further than the 1953 liberation of Iran and the 1954 liberation of Guatemala.

Mr. Yeltsin,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am writing this letter to encourage you to act. One rarely finds oneself in such an opportune position. Gorbachev does not have our interests at heart. He is moving far too slowly to privatize, and my deep fear is that he has no intention of doing so at all. I understand that you have expressed similar concerns. With that in mind, here is a proposal to remedy the situation.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several of my top advisors at the Company maintain a monetary connection with the Communist old guard. They tell me that a riot might easily be incited while Gorbachev is away. If you were to repel an attempt to seize parliament in front of the media, it could very well tip the scales of power in your favor.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telephone me at No. 10 and we shall talk further.

December, 2000<br><br>RE: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privatization<br><br>S.,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have convinced Sandra to join the majority opinion. The enticement of retirement under a Republican president tipped the scales. Although the ruling will differ from our previous decisions on Equal Protection, it will not call attention to our actual goals. With Sandra gone, we can pave the way for the key majority member of the Order to be seated. As discussed, W. will prove the perfect distraction. I have no doubt he will restart animosities with Iraq. Let him, it will give C.’s contractors more work. When the time comes, I will make sure W. is given Roberts' name.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Roberts on the court, it will only be a matter of waiting for the right case. After the destruction of Campaign Finance laws, the Company will be free to elect anyone they choose to the Senate, the House and, eventually, the Presidency.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, our hopes will be realized. Government will no longer derive its authority from the people, but from us, their protectors.

Research Division<br>September, 1985<br><br>Dear S.,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research has progressed far more rapidly than expected. We already have a working prototype capable of mimicking P.O.E. capabilities across a network, albeit at far lower intensity. Testing will commence locally on Subject 4 between his Animus sessions, as per our plan. If all goes well, deployment will occur worldwide.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dream is about to become a reality. Soon, capitalists and workers will be locked in a closed loop that is safe and prosperous for humanity. No more war, only desks, cars and TV sets. We will protect them and keep them safe, forever.<br><br>W. V.

Abnormal Brain Activity Discovered in Children, Aged 3 Months to 18-Years-Old and Adults, Aged 19-30.<br><br>Abstract<br><br>Several recent studies conducted by internal marketing teams revealed that: "Entertainment sales are dropping, protests are mounting. The economy is in turmoil. All market research indicates that the system should be stabilizing, but, instead, we're seeing the opposite."(1) In response, our team set out to discover the cause of the declining efficacy of Abstergo's control methods.<br><br>Past studies of bilateral brain activation during television, film and video game use have shown the characteristic ARAS patterns induced by Abstergo's signal patterns. Our study was conducted on a range of test subjects (30 subjects, aged +-10 to +-30), who viewed TV programs while resting-state fMRI scans were conducted.<br><br>In contrast to previous studies, 80% of test subjects showed heightened cortical brain activity. Detailed scans using our prototype dMRI machine revealed an increased rate of neuronal development (+-30% over that of older age groups). Such a marked increase does not fit Darwinian models. Further studies are required to define the ultimate outcome of this abnormal evolution.<br><br>1. Abstergo Quarterly Marketing Report, 04/17/12.

FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION<br><br>His Holiness the Pope and the Illustrious Captain General Cesare request that you amend the sermon texts given to you thus far to include the message from Romulus that the Assassins must be attacked. As you have done so effectively before by sending Roma's terrified citizens to our doorstep, now you must do to rid this city of the Assassins. <br><br>The usual amount of florins will be deposited at the bank for you and the other head priests to pick up. <br><br>Go with God,<br><br>Cardinal Francisco de Borja

Hello Lucy,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your last email troubled me, more for your sake than the fate of the project. I have no idea what has gotten into you, but you're going to come down with an ulcer if you don't relax a little. You're doing excellent work, there is nothing for you to worry about. In terms of Desmond, however, I think you are somewhat justified in your concern. I need you to keep an eye on him and report anything you observe that might be relevant.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you get back here, we'll run tests on him, but I'm sure on your watch there will be no need to worry. Take care of yourself, get some sleep!<br><br>- William

Hey guys,<br><br>Just a quick heads up:<br><br>There was a white unmarked van parked across the street when I went to get batteries yesterday and it was still there today when I came back with the food. It's a little too non-descript for my liking and it's just the right size for surveillance gear.<br><br>I checked again a few minutes ago and it was gone but keep an eye out.<br><br>r3b3cca

Hello Shaun,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's an update of team locations and activities for you to pass on to the others. You'll probably be contacted by one of the members from Sao Paolo. You're their lifeline, so be ready. You'll be glad to know that everyone here is safe for the time being. I'm sure Lucy told you that you'll all be coming here once you have the Apple of Eden. I don't know what you've heard about this place, but there will be a lot here to show you that I know you're going to love. Lots of history.<br><br>Moscow- They remain safe and secure. They are currently chasing a potential lead on another Piece of Eden so fingers crossed on that one. I've done a little research for them myself and have confirmed a few of their suspicions so it's looking good at the moment. <br><br>Sao Paolo- They had to move safe houses again and this time it was too close. It's suspected there's a leak on their team so headquarters is looking into it. It's likely the team will go dark soon to try and flush out the mole. Hopefully they can catch it before it catches up to them but they are supported so that's a plus.<br><br>Osaka- As per plan, they are still dark. They're scheduled to make contact with headquarters in 72 hours so hopefully they're ok and have lost their tail. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't share this one with the others yet. I don't want to alarm them until absolutely necessary:<br><br>Denver- Off the grid and this one isn't planned. It looks like we may have lost another one. Headquarters is investigating. <br><br>- William

I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the same way sometimes, but when I do, I try to think about what would become of this world if we weren't fighting this fight. It is hard Rebecca and that's why you were chosen, like me, because you can endure. But I know your resilience doesn't make you invincible. Come by my room in the morning and we can talk about whatever.<br><br>Lucy

Dear Lucy,<br><br>I regret to inform you I will no longer be able to trek into town for the foreseeable future. I'll spare you the gory details but suffice to say an exchange of words, hand gestures and grunts with a large Italian fellow have made clear to me he plans to murder your favourite male co-worker on sight.

I'm not sure if we can do that, but ask again once you're back here. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We've analyzed the tapes you left for us and Desmond seems to be progressing perfectly. I can see that you've developed a good rapport, just make sure that your friendship doesn't jeopardize our goals. The Temples Minerva mentioned on the last tape might be the only thing that can stop the end from arriving. Great work as always and hang in there! <br><br>- William

Hello Shaun,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still with the others, no disasters yet. It looks like Abstergo is focusing on their satellite instead of hunting for us, so that buys some time. I'm worried about Denver though. Let's try to touch base at 3AM. You'll be up with Desmond and I'm having trouble sleeping these days anyway. The unexpected heat of this European fall is killing me. I don't know how you continentals handle it. You might as well pass the Denver info on now that it's escalated, they have a right to know.<br><br>Moscow- They remain safe and secure. The lead they've been chasing is becoming more and more promising. It's checking out under cross reference and they've been undisturbed by Templars to date. They're keeping security tight and staying vigilant but it's nice to get some good news for a change. <br><br>Sao Paolo- Has gone dark as per spec. The leak was confirmed and the team has set about smoking it out. They will likely move cities during their off-the-grid and will let us know where they are when the resurface.<br><br>Osaka- Made contact. Have yet to lose their tail so have gone back under until further notice.  <br><br>Denver- Headquarters went to their safe house and everything was gone which means 1 of 2 things: They were attacked and captured by Templars who took all their gear for analysis OR they went code RED without warning and went off-the-grid with no time to notify headquarters. Let's hope for the latter.<br><br>Take care,<br><br>- William

Lucy,<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issues you raised in your last voicemail have taken me by surprise, to say the least. Think of all the work, all the stress and planning we've all put into this. We had our suspicions for years about Minerva, about that particular Piece of Eden. Your tapes confirmed it, now we can study it and discover the truth. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You've been waiting nearly a decade for this day, don't put Desmond in danger just because of feelings you may or may not have. We're only going to get one shot at this with the short amount of time left. Don't fail us now. <br><br>- William

SALAI

Id: [0x0004DE1C]
Date of Birth: 1480.<br>Profession: Apprentice.<br><br>Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno (try saying that three times fast) was apprenticed to Leonardo da Vinci at the ripe young age of ten.  <br><br>As evidenced by Leonardo’s notes, the two hit it off almost immediately: "The second day I had two shirts cut out for him, a pair of hose and a jerkin, and when I put aside some money to pay for these things he stole the money out of the purse; and I could never make him confess although I was quite certain of it. The day after I went to sup with Giacomo Andrea, and the said Gian Giacomo supped for two and did mischief for four, for he broke three cruets and spilled the wine." <br><br>Leonardo may have described his apprentice as a "thief, liar, obstinate, glutton", and bestowed him with the nickname Salai (a little devil from the Romantic epic "Morgante") but at the same time the two were devoted to each other until the Master's death.  Leonardo helped Salai with his painting compositions, frequently bailed him out of prison and left half his vineyard to Salai when he died. The apprentice even got to keep the Mona Lisa.<br><br>Either this was true love, or Salai had one hell of a sugar daddy.

DUCCIO DE LUCA

Id: [0x0004DE1E]
Date of Birth:  1462.<br>Profession: Merchant, Trader.<br><br>After breaking things off with Claudia Auditore, records indicate that Duccio's marriage into the Pazzi family was cut short by their exile following the Conspiracy of 1478. Rebounding with several substantial donations to the textile guilds, Duccio became a wool trader, exporting Florentine products across Italy. <br><br>He was not exactly well-liked by the business world: "The rotund man who sold me the silks tried to charge more florins than the silks were worth, considering me to be uneducated in textile prices. I took him for a rube, and purchased only red silks, which fetch a far higher price at market. Now who is the ignorant one?" wrote one wool merchant in Siena, presumably speaking about Duccio, who is referenced several more times in the man's books under various monikers, such as: "stooge", "pig" and "son of a whore". <br><br>Roman shipyard manifests indicate that Duccio bought a small ship in 1490, presumably in an attempt to become an alum trader. Unfortunately, the boat he owned was too small for alum trading, which required a large ship to be profitable.  His record books show little to no profit for the years of 1490-1496. In 1497, he ceased to carry alum, instead transporting a variety of goods between cities. Some small success was achieved smuggling forbidden merchandise out of Florence during Savonarola's rule. <br><br>Ultimately, his luck turned sour and he died penniless in 1520, medical records are unclear but his death seems to have resulted from rabies after a starving Roman dog attacked him in search of food.

ERCOLE MASSIMO

Id: [0x0004DE20]
Date of Birth: 1474. <br>Profession: Noble, Hermeticist.<br><br>Born into what many historians believe to be the wealthiest family of Renaissance Rome, Ercole was the result of a lineage that traced its origins to a divine union between Hercules and a nymph. Following the rise of the family's namesake Maximus, who was an important Roman politician and solider, the family went on to produce two popes, innumerable cardinals and ambassadors. The Massimo were also great patrons of the arts, the first printed book in Italy was produced in their Roman palazzo. <br><br>Ercole was no exception to the family tradition, he participated in the formation of a Roman library, and partnered with Agostino Chigi, the wealthy Roman banker, to help fund the arts. He even succeeded in convincing Pope Julius II to invite the great painter Perugino to the Vatican to help decorate the papal apartments.<br><br>At the age of thirty, it seems Ercole became heavily invested in the cult teachings of Hermes Trismegistus, whose writings had recently been translated by the Florentine scholar Marsilio Ficino. Along with all the new-age, geeky, mumbo-jumbo of practicing magic and alchemy, Hermeticists believed in the divine power of man, that man could contain the universe within him and vice versa, placing the Roman gods and the Christian/Judeo/Muslim god on the same level as man (notice how I was just politically correct there, it's born from fear, not from conviction, so don't get used to it). Ercole joined a hermetic society in Rome and seems to have devoted significant time to his activities there. <br><br>The appointment book from the Massimo palazzo library lists Leonardo Da Vinci as a frequent visitor. One entry describes him as "Leonardo, friend to His Excellency, Ercole." Perhaps Leonardo shared his search for the Pythagorean temple.<br><br>I wish I could tell you more, but secret societies don't usually leave records lying around for historians.

DELIZIA DI BELRIGUARDO

Id: [0x0004DE22]
Built in 1435 by Niccolò III d'Este as a summer home, Belriguardo was continuously added to until it became one of the most celebrated palaces in Italy.  It featured stabling for five hundred horses, secret passages, stately corridors, marble loggias, box-lined gardens and a chapel painted by Cosimo Tura. And if that isn't enough to spark your interest, it contained a succession of vast frescoed halls, leading to the Sala di Psiche with its renowned series of murals detailing the Roman myths. To quote an awed visitor: "Seeing this beautiful palace with its glazed and iron-grilled windows, I should think that a circuit of the place would be more than a mile."<br><br>Of course, all good things must come to an end, while all bad things, like aging pop divas and 70s style, are seemingly never-ending. In 1598, the Este family left, and Belriguardo became a stable, with horses living in the frescoed rooms. <br><br>Today, little remains of the palace.

HERMETICISTS

Id: [0x0004DE24]
The Renaissance Hermeticists were a secretive lot, hiding their beliefs and practices from the Church. <br><br>Their texts originated in 2nd Century Greece, dealing with issues such as alchemy and the proper relationship between man, the gods and the Earth. In 1460, the texts were introduced to the western world when they arrived in Pistoia. A translation into Latin was made by the flamboyant Florentine, Marsilio Ficino, and spread throughout Italy. <br><br>This revival of Hermetical beliefs focused on a heretical lack of hierarchy. That man contained the universe, just as God did, meaning each part of the universe was also a representation of the whole. Man, therefore, could be seen as the centre of the universe.<br><br>Hermeticism was driven underground, for, if man could contain God, then what role was there for the Church? <br><br>Benevolent caretaker of choir practice spaces, apparently, was not seen as an appealing alternative.

POPULARITY

Id: [0x0004E0EC]
Average appeal of the zone. The more popular a shop, the more expensive the investment, and the more you will share your final earnings with the other investors (other players investing in the same shop).

Id: [0x0004E0ED]
Low popularity = low sharing.

Id: [0x0004E0EE]
Medium popularity = medium sharing.

RISK FACTOR

Id: [0x0004E0F1]
Each zone has a fixed risk factor (the higher the risk is, the less chance you have to reach the maximum earning potential).

Id: [0x0004E0F2]
Five levels of risk: Safe, Very low, Low, High and Very high

Id: [0x0004E0F3]
The combination of Popularity and Risk Factor will determine the outcome of your earnings, it is up to you to determine how risky you want to be.

Id: [0x000C70C6]
These crops need to be loaded for transport by the day's end.

Id: [0x000C70C8]
A little more than a moment of my time, don't you think?

Id: [0x000C70C9]
I'm sorry. We are normally two, but my son cannot keep up.

Id: [0x000C70CB]
He is too young to be working the fields.

Id: [0x000C70CC]
I know it. But my field hands ran off when I couldn't pay. The tax collectors demand all my grain, or they will burn my house down.

Id: [0x000C70CD]
One thing at a time. Let your boy rest. I will help you collect your harvest.

Id: [0x000CA6E0]
Are you the priest of Serqet? I come bearing the salve you asked.

Id: [0x000CA6E1]
And not a moment too soon! Hand it over.

Id: [0x000CA6E2]
ECH! This smells truly rancid, it should do nicely.

Id: [0x000CA6E3]
Thank you man, you just might have saved this poor person's life. We should let him rest now.

Id: [0x000CA6E5]
This hyena's fat should do nicely... I guess.

Id: [0x000CA6E7]
That's a lot of gizzard for just one bird.

Id: [0x000CA70C]
You there! Do you know this child?

Id: [0x000CA70D]
NUNCLE!

Id: [0x000CA70E]
What's this? Little Bau, what are you doing here? Who is this man?

Id: [0x000CA70F]
My name is Bayek. I found the little one not too far from here, hiding and wounded. It seems soldiers attacked the rebel camp where he lived and he barely escape with his life.

Id: [0x000CA710]
Is this true Bau? Thank the gods you're safe!

Id: [0x000CA711]
I'm afraid his parents didn't share his luck. Do you think you can take care of him?

Id: [0x000CA712]
I'll raise him as best I can. No child should be abandoned like this.

Id: [0x000CA713]
Best I head back now. Best of luck to you, little one.

Id: [0x000CA7E4]
It's not safe to speak here, Follow me!

Id: [0x000CA7E8]
It's not safe to talk here! Let's get back to our safe spot!

Id: [0x000CA7E9]
Thank you for killing the evil priest.

Id: [0x000CA7EA]
Now we can all live in peace.

Id: [0x000CA81D]
My daughter was wounded, please come with me and help me bring her to a doctor.

Id: [0x000CA870]
I am a dummy scene just for placeholder purposes.

Id: [0x000CA880]
Please! Don't hurt me! They threatened me, i had no choice

Id: [0x000CA881]
Here! Take this as an appology

Id: [0x000CA884]
There he is! Kill him!

Id: [0x000CA8CD]
Are you here to help? Thank god! Come along!

Id: [0x000CA902]
Hey Bayek. Come let's get to the island. I will tell you more later. 

Id: [0x000CA9C2]
Bayek: Another damaged scroll. But on this one somebody started writing something new. But only Greek names.

Id: [0x000CA9EF]
Bayek: Vitruvius' documents say this is where the workers get their jobs for the day.

Id: [0x000CA9F0]
Bayek: I should look around. Best to find the foreman.

Id: [0x000CA9F7]
Bayek: Strange… The Romans are guarding the place, but nobody is working here.

Id: [0x000CA9F8]
Bayek: I need to search for clues inside. 

Id: [0x000CA9F9]
Bayek: Are you the Stone work's foreman?

Id: [0x000CA9FA]
Hesiod: Yes. Who is asking?

Id: [0x000CA9FB]
Bayek: The name is Bayek. I'm looking for some friends of mine who should be working for you.

Id: [0x000CA9FC]
Hesiod: There are no refugees working here! None of them showed for work after arriving. As far I am concern they probably stole something and ran off.

Id: [0x000CA9FD]
Hesiod: I told the Proconsul, that it is not a good idea to offer them work and to welcome them so easily.

Id: [0x000CA9FE]
Bayek: Where have you seen them last?

Id: [0x000CA9FF]
Hesiod: At the slave's quarters. If you find them, tell them they are not welcomed here!

Id: [0x000CAA00]
Bayek: Hey boy, can you point me to somebody who works the stones?

Id: [0x000CAA01]
Slave: I do sir.

Id: [0x000CAA02]
Bayek: Aren't you a bit young?

Id: [0x000CAA03]
Slave: No sir. Most of my friends are working the fields, but I'm stronger and the Romans put me here.

Id: [0x000CAA04]
Bayek: Then you might be able to help me. Have you seen a group of Siwan refugees, coming to work here?

Id: [0x000CAA05]
Slave: Yes. They came some time ago. The foreman wasn't too happy about it, and put them to sleep with us, rather with the Greek workers.

Id: [0x000CAA06]
Bayek: And where they are now?

Id: [0x000CAA07]
Slave: Last I saw them, several days ago, they went to work at the south part of the Stone Works. But now the Romans restricted anyone from getting there. I don't know what they are doing there.

Id: [0x000CAA08]
Bayek: I'm grateful for your help boy! If you need anything from me, just name it.

Id: [0x000CAA09]
Slave: I do can use your help, but you better go finds your friends, I can wait.

Id: [0x000CAA0A]
Bayek: Take care then, see ya later.

Id: [0x000CAA0B]
Bayek: The place has almost no work done. The refugees worked here no more than half a day.

Id: [0x000CAA0C]
Bayek: Their tools are lying on the ground. There is blood on some of them.

Id: [0x000CAA0D]
Bayek: I can see marks from dragging man. Let's see where they lead.

Id: [0x000CAA0E]
Bayek: There must be something under that cover

Id: [0x000CAA0F]
Bayek destroys the cover

Id: [0x000CAA10]
Bayek: Oh God! They are all dead. But what is this? They managed to kill one of the Romans. He is dressed like Hesiod's guards.

Id: [0x000CAA13]
Bayek: I must finds Hesiod and get an explanation

Id: [0x000CAA1A]
Bayek: A damaged scroll. But on this one somebody started writing something new. But only Greek names.

Id: [0x000CAA1B]
Bayek: Hmm… This looks like a job schedule, issued by the foreman, but the paper is damaged. Some of the names do look Egyptian, but I'm not sure.

Id: [0x000CAA1C]
Bayek: Hesiod, what happened with the Siwan workers?!

Id: [0x000CAA1D]
Hesiod: What do you mean? Didn't I tell you that they bolted!

Id: [0x000CAA1E]
Bayek: Do not play with me! Did you kill them, or you just covered up their deaths? What happened to them?

Id: [0x000CAA1F]
Hesiod: By the Gods, why did you put your nose where it does not belong? Men! Kill him! I do not want the Proconsul getting upset all over those dirty refugees!

Id: [0x000CAB90]
There are a few notes in there. It seems some of the miners are stealing natron from the production to make some profit on the side.

Id: [0x000CAB91]
The overseer will want to see this, might even pay a pretty penny for it.

Id: [0x000CAB92]
This site isn't isolated enough. I need to look for a more concealed location.

Id: [0x000CAB93]
Here's the stash.

Id: [0x000CAB94]
I'll have to wait until nightfall if I'm to see the exchange.

Id: [0x000CAB95]
There's the man. I need to bring him back alive to the overseer.

Id: [0x000CAB96]
There's a note next to all those marked bags. Says the money stash is going to be collected at the Anubis shrine tonight.

Id: [0x000CAB97]
I can intercept the exchange tonight and capture the perpetrator.

Id: [0x000CAB98]
This can't be the place, too exposed, too many prying eyes.

Id: [0x000CABAB]
This place is isolated enough. Better start looking for anything suspicious.

Id: [0x000CABD8]
Can you help me mister?

Id: [0x000CABD9]
A child? What are you doing here, little one? This is no place fo you to be.

Id: [0x000CABDA]
Soldiers attacked our camp and I ran from the hills as fast as I could. I got hurt so I hid here. Where are my parents?

Id: [0x000CABDB]
I don't know if you'll be seeing your parents anytime soon. Do you have someone you can go to?

Id: [0x000CABDC]
I was looking for my uncle who's a traveling merchant. He comes and goes on the road to Memphis.

Id: [0x000CABDD]
It would be unwise to let you travel alone. I'll help you find your uncle.

Id: [0x000CB554]
A healer from the mine told me you could provide me with garlic cloves?

Id: [0x000CB555]
Ah yes, I owe him that much for his services. Here you go sir.

Id: [0x000CB556]
Hopefully, the garlic with cover some of the smell.

Id: [0x000CB58E]
I pray my eyes deceive me. I didn't hope to meet your here Bayek.

Id: [0x000CB58F]
Nefertari. It's been quite a long time. How are...

Id: [0x000CB590]
No time to talk. Packing my things. You, go fetch my horse.

Id: [0x000CB591]
Uh, where might I find it?

Id: [0x000CB592]
Look into the loading area. Use your head, you'll find it.

Id: [0x000CB593]
Alright...

Id: [0x000CB594]
Here, Nefertari, I bring your lost horse, just like you asked.

Id: [0x000CB595]
Misplaced horse. Now, just need to find my things...

Id: [0x000CB596]
How are things? Are you...

Id: [0x000CB597]
No time for small talk. Curses, I can't find my satchel! Gods so help me...

Id: [0x000CB5A0]
Worker: What do you want?

Id: [0x000CB5A1]
Bayek: The architect sent me to look for his documents. Did you happen to see where he might've left them?

Id: [0x000CB5A2]
Worker: Certainly not! We are not allowed to focus on anything other than working. But I did notice some soldiers stashing something further down the mine.

Id: [0x000CB5A3]
Bayek: Thank you!

Id: [0x000CB5A4]
Worker: Before you leave, can I ask you for a jar of oil?

Id: [0x000CB5A5]
Bayek: Of course!

Id: [0x000CB5A6]
Worker: How did you know I needed oil? Thank you kind man!

Id: [0x000CB5A7]
Bayek: Of course!

Id: [0x000CB5C2]
Test

Id: [0x000CB5CC]
Hello! We heard rumours of groups of scouts roaming the area, they could be trouble...

Id: [0x000CB5CD]
Wow...Yes...

Id: [0x000CB5CE]
Okay!!!

Id: [0x000CB5CF]
Hello! We have some sergeant who needs his life removed, please kindly do so!

Id: [0x000CB5D0]
Hmmm....Yes...

Id: [0x000CB5D1]
Very good!

Id: [0x000CC46D]
They're coming for me, I can feel it!

Id: [0x000CC46E]
Bandits have captured my whole family & they're coming for me.

Id: [0x000CC46F]
My mother has been captured first, she must be already at their hideout at the cave.

Id: [0x000CC470]
My father has just been captured and must be on a cart nearby.

Id: [0x000CC471]
I'll save them, stay hidden.

Id: [0x000CC628]
Peach pits. Half my father's herds died because of this.

Id: [0x000CC62A]
Your coat has lost its luster, Shining One. And your flanks are hollowed.

Id: [0x000CC680]
Greetings, Sisters of Osiris.

Id: [0x000CC682]
How long have you served in this temple?

Id: [0x000CC683]
Let the way be made for you to join Osiris.

Id: [0x000CC684]
Go in peace to the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x000CC6B2]
Hey! You! You look courageous!

Id: [0x000CC6B3]
Bandits have raided our village a few days ago.

Id: [0x000CC6B4]
We have been able to track them here, they have set-up a small camp at the other end of this burned village. 

Id: [0x000CC6B5]
They have taken something irreplaceable for our village and we must take it back.

Id: [0x000CC6B6]
We were waiting for a another friend before attacking them, but with you we should be fine.

Id: [0x000CC6B7]
Follow us!

Id: [0x000CC6B8]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x000CC71C]
Here. The flesh has decayed, but the wrappings are still intact.

Id: [0x000CC71D]
I will pay the mummification temple a visit.

Id: [0x000CC82D]
If natron is used to dry the bodies…

Id: [0x000CC82E]
There may be something wrong with the natron.

Id: [0x000CC82F]
I should speak to the worker out back.

Id: [0x000CC833]
These bodies are dried with natron?

Id: [0x000CC834]
Mmmph. Who might you be?

Id: [0x000CC835]
A temple inspector.

Id: [0x000CC8E6]
The seal of Anubis. A priest sabotaged the natron.

Id: [0x000CC8E7]
The letter mentions a bandit cave. I will go clear out this viper's nest once and for all.

Id: [0x000CC8EE]
So, you would have me work a spell to send you a true seeing?

Id: [0x000CC8EF]
Yes, Wise One.

Id: [0x000CC8F0]
It is good. Many secret signs will be revealed to you this way.

Id: [0x000CC8F3]
Are you ready to travel to the Moist Land?

Id: [0x000CC8F4]
Bring me the cauldron.

Id: [0x000CCB60]
[gasp] I have shed innocent blood. This act will weigh on my Balance.

Id: [0x000CCB61]
[ono] You were not the enemy. May the Hidden One pardon me.

Id: [0x000CCB62]
[ono] Not the Lizard. I should have stayed my blade.

Id: [0x000CCB63]
[ono] I place myself in the hands of the Lord of Law. This priest was guiltless.

Id: [0x000CCBCE]
These mummies are sound. Not the cause of the smell.

Id: [0x000CCC0F]
I would not want to make an enemy of you.

Id: [0x000CCC10]
I have no enemies, and no secrets, either.

Id: [0x000CCC12]
What do you--

Id: [0x000CCFDD]
It is time.

Id: [0x000CCFDE]
What must I do?

Id: [0x000CCFDF]
As you were originally instructed.

Id: [0x000CD349]
Innocents mutilated, children ripped from the womb, the High Priest's name abused--

Id: [0x000CD355]
I have my gods. Now face yours.

Id: [0x000CD390]
Forgive, Lord Caesar. We bring a gift from our Pharaoh, Cleopatra.

Id: [0x000CD391]
In place of an envoy, Cleopatra sends a rug?

Id: [0x000CD455]
Hello Bayek my friend! We need to relay some info to those people, can you escort me there? For old time's sake

Id: [0x000CD456]
Hmmm...

Id: [0x000CD457]
Okay!

Id: [0x000CD731]
That cow does not belong to you. Hand it over so that I can return it to its rightful owner.

Id: [0x000CD732]
Hand it over? Not without some compensation, my friend.

Id: [0x000CD733]
You are a man of opportunities I see! Can I interest you in something else? 

Id: [0x000CD734]
I have no interest in deals with dishonest people any more than I need to. 

Id: [0x000CE50E]
Peace be upon you

Id: [0x000CE50F]
And upon you

Id: [0x000CE510]
I was just talking to Phoxidas about another favor

Id: [0x000CE511]
Or you could just take over the business and you won't need to get any more favors from this old man

Id: [0x000CE512]
This time its far bigger than I believe I can handle

Id: [0x000CE513]
All hail Cleopatra, kindred of Horus and Ra, beloved of the moon and sun, daughter to Isis, and of Upper and Lower Egypt - Queen!

Id: [0x000CE514]
By the Gods - what is this?

Id: [0x000CE515]
The favor I was talking about

Id: [0x000CE516]
Hello Aya and Bayek. This must be the great Merchant Captain Phoxidas.

Id: [0x000CE517]
I thought I had forgotten how much I hated you royals. apparently my memory still serves me well.

Id: [0x000CE518]
Old man you have a sharp tongue, be careful it does not cut your head off.

Id: [0x000CE519]
Stand down Apollodorus. I am here to ask for his fleet not his brains.

Id: [0x000CE51A]
Why you --

Id: [0x000CE51B]
She seeks passage to Alexandria by way of the Mediterranean

Id: [0x000CE51C]
Can't they just travel by horse then?

Id: [0x000CE51D]
The roads are far too dangerous and it would take many moons.

Id: [0x000CE51E]
She needs to get there much faster than horseback can allow, and I know of no other vessel faster than your slowest ship.

Id: [0x000CE51F]
Well said! Meet me here when the sun has almost completed its descend. I have preparations to make.

Id: [0x000CE520]
And make sure I am to be FAIRLY compensated for this - service

Id: [0x000CE521]
I will make the other preparations we need, may the Gods be merciful

Id: [0x000CEA8D]
A new face. I dont know you, do I?

Id: [0x000CEA8E]
Just a traveller passing through. This is quite a collection you have here.

Id: [0x000CEA8F]
Beasts for the pits in Rome. 

Id: [0x000CEA90]
It's been rough trip, we'll need to feed them before heading out or they wont survive the trip to Rome. 

Id: [0x000CEA91]
You seem like a tough fellow. help us out and we'll make it worth your while.

Id: [0x000CEA92]
I'll see what I can do, but I... 

Id: [0x000CEA93]
Yes, yes. We pay well! you best head out. 

Id: [0x000CEC59]
But you've much to tell me. About the Hyena.

Id: [0x000CEC5A]
Ah, funny. As it turns out, that happens to be the most expensive thing I'm offering.

Id: [0x000CEC5B]
A new face. I dont know you, do I?

Id: [0x000CEC5C]
Just a traveller passing through. This is quite a collection you have here.

Id: [0x000CEC5D]
Beasts for the pits in Rome. 

Id: [0x000CEC5E]
It's been rough trip, we'll need to feed them before heading out or they wont survive the trip back home.

Id: [0x000CEC5F]
You seem like a tough fellow. help us out and we'll make it worth your while.

Id: [0x000CEC60]
I'll see what I can do, but I... 

Id: [0x000CEC61]
Yes, yes. We pay well! you best head out. 

Id: [0x000CEC62]
Just leave it in the warehouse when you're done!

Id: [0x000CEC63]
GAAAHHH!!!

Id: [0x000CEC64]
YAAAHHH!!!

Id: [0x000CEC65]
SHOO!!!

Id: [0x000CEC66]
Away with you!

Id: [0x000CEC67]
Help! Warrior! Help me!

Id: [0x000CEC8C]
He'll be here soon. I dream of my son, and his sons, following in my steps.

Id: [0x000CEC8D]
I do not have the luxury of dreams. Just finding the Scarab.

Id: [0x000CEDC0]
Ready? The ceremony should be beginning shortly, we should go.

Id: [0x000CEDC1]
Are you sure "the snake" is going to be at the ceremony?

Id: [0x000CEDC2]
Ptolemy never leaves the palace without his advisors.

Id: [0x000CEDC3]
If the snake is there, I need to find him.

Id: [0x000CEDD3]
We are almost there, I hope my family got home safely.

Id: [0x000CEDD4]
Your wife and kids are strong, they should be fine.

Id: [0x000CEDDC]
Below the Sphinx, you'll find the planetarium. Here is the key.

Id: [0x000CEDDD]
Thanks.

Id: [0x000CEDDE]
Please come back later. We could discuss how we can revive our children using the secrets of the pyramids...

Id: [0x000CEE98]
This is far from the sorry ruin of my last visit.

Id: [0x000CEE9C]
Yamu now plays constant host to ceremonies showing our "rustic" way of life…

Id: [0x000CEE9D]
…which attract many visitors with more gold than sense.

Id: [0x000CEE9E]
A description well suited to Alexandrians. How does this sit with your faith?

Id: [0x000CEE9F]
I confess that my thoughts are sometimes uneasy…

Id: [0x000CEF08]
Did you see a Roman around here recently? 

Id: [0x000CEF09]
Now you mention it, there was a commotion outside

Id: [0x000CEF0A]
When I came out, I saw some guards take him down by the river. Didn't look too friendly

Id: [0x000CEF0B]
I'm looking for a Roman

Id: [0x000CEF0C]
Well go to Rome. It's where they belong. They have no business around here.

Id: [0x000CEF0F]
Have you seen a Roman diplomat around?

Id: [0x000CEF10]
Bloody Romans. What have they done for us? Well, there is the aquaduct....

Id: [0x000CEF13]
Heard there was a Roman hanging around here. You seen him?

Id: [0x000CEF14]
Can't say I have, I just got here before you did

Id: [0x000CEF16]
Well, looks like he won't be reporting in anytime soon. 

Id: [0x000CEF17]
Judging by the uniform, you must be Caesars man.

Id: [0x000CEF18]
Flavius at your service. I am getting out of here, I suggest you do the same

Id: [0x000CEFD5]
Hasina! You must come down from here.

Id: [0x000CEFD6]
This would be a good place to watch the stars!

Id: [0x000CEFD7]
Only the priests are permitted here. You know that.

Id: [0x000CEFD8]
Yes, but I want to see--

Id: [0x000CEFD9]
Hush, come down now. We can watch stars from the riverbank.

Id: [0x000CEFDF]
Bayek! My friend. Let me finish this little "thing" and i'll meet you tonight at the Oasis. We have a culling to attend!

Id: [0x000CEFE0]
Senu!?

Id: [0x000CEFEB]
How did your path ever bring you this far?

Id: [0x000CEFEC]
After we parted ways, I found myself caught by strong currents.

Did you ever return to Siwa? To your role as Medjay?

Id: [0x000CEFEE]
What is this place?

Id: [0x000CEFEF]
Shrine to Sobek. Very old. Very dangerous.

Id: [0x000CEFF0]
Climb. It Is not safe down here.

Id: [0x000CF025]
Do you know anything of flawed mummies sold to tourists?

Id: [0x000CF026]
If you are not here to buy, I have no time for your questions.

Id: [0x000CF027]
Menehet, the priest, is concerned about the--

Id: [0x000CF028]
And I am concerned about my business, so keep your distance!

Id: [0x000CF032]
Greetings, I am--

Id: [0x000CF033]
You have come to the right place, neb! We have everything you could possibly want!

Id: [0x000CF034]
What I want is to ask about false idols sold at the market.

Id: [0x000CF035]
I have heard rumors of such, but there is nothing to them. Now leave, if you want to avoid trouble.

Id: [0x000CF036]
I'd better return at night, when we can speak freely.

Id: [0x000CF070]
Menehet! Your brood is delivered safely home.

Id: [0x000CF071]
Thank you, friend.

Id: [0x000CF072]
What did that fool want with you?

Id: [0x000CF073]
Some visitors, having purchased religious objects, are angry when our village has no more dead cats to sell them.

Id: [0x000CF075]
Though not a merchant, I am often the means by which the aggrieved snuff their anger.

Id: [0x000CF076]
This matter needs a firm hand.

Id: [0x000CF0A0]
I'm looking for Ghupa, the mute. Is he living here? 

Id: [0x000CF0A1]
Yes! Ghupa is like my grandpa! I'm Taharka Junior. 

Id: [0x000CF0A2]
Well Taharka Junior, can you show me where your grandpa is? 

Id: [0x000CF0A3]
He is not here for the moment... But he show me where he was going! See that camp over the hill? That's where he went. 

Id: [0x000CF0A4]
Is Ghupa a soldier? 

Id: [0x000CF0A5]
No, he hates soldiers, especially those ones, he thinks they are bad men. 

Id: [0x000CF0A6]
I'm going to see if Ghupa is ok then. I'm not fond of soldiers myself. 

Id: [0x000CF0A7]
Can I come with you? 

Id: [0x000CF0A8]
Certainly not! Might be dangerous. You stay here, I'm bringing Ghupa back. 

Id: [0x000CF0A9]
This must be Pamu.

Id: [0x000CF0AA]
Ugh. The man stinks of beer.

Id: [0x000CF0B7]
That is Pamu! What has happened to him?!

Id: [0x000CF0B8]
His passion for toasting Sekhmet has exceeded his head for drink.

Id: [0x000CF0B9]
This is a disaster! People have come from the Red Land and the Black to see him fight!

Id: [0x000CF0BA]
If a fight is all that's needed, I could replace him.

Id: [0x000CF0BB]
Of course, Medjay! You honor yourself in saving me from disgrace.

Id: [0x000CF0BC]
Speak to the High Priest in the temple courtyard. He will take care of the rest.

Id: [0x000CF0BD]
Though this is a friendly bout, you must stay vigilant.

Id: [0x000CF0BE]
Do not fear. Sekhmet will receive a fine tribute.

Id: [0x000CF0BF]
Thank you so much Bayek. This festivities would have been a disaster without you.

Id: [0x000CF0C0]
It was an honor to help you Mehenet!

Id: [0x000CF0C1]
Say hello to father next time you see him.

Id: [0x000CF0C2]
And, my friend, just know that you'll always be welcome here!

Id: [0x000CF0C3]
Thanks! I'll pay you a visit next time I pass by the city!

Id: [0x000CF0C4]
I shall go now. Peace upon you and your family Mehenet.

Id: [0x000CF0CE]
Okay! We are now ready to go, let me just gather my people

Id: [0x000CF0CF]
Ok Boys! Let's do this!

Id: [0x000CF0D8]
Why did you… kill them? We had only just met!

Id: [0x000CF0D9]
Klaudios, you're drunk.

Id: [0x000CF0DA]
Yes! That is me… and NO! I am not. I had only two or ten beers. [burp]

Id: [0x000CF0DB]
All right, let's get you back to your wife.

Id: [0x000CF0DC]
I have a wife?! Mother will be so pleased!

Id: [0x000CF0E9]
Medjay! Help me… I will pay you!

Id: [0x000CF0EB]
None of these brutes honor a wife's pain. I beg you…

Id: [0x000CF0EC]
I will seek him out.

Id: [0x000CF0ED]
Do be quick. I will await you here.

Id: [0x000CF0F3]
What was your reason for going out there, Klaudios?

Id: [0x000CF0F4]
I was going… mhhmm… I do not really remember.

Id: [0x000CF0F5]
I came from Alexandria for the festival…

Id: [0x000CF0F6]
…and some kind of… person… someone… offered me to drink all night. For free!

Id: [0x000CF0F7]
Impossible to resi… resist.

Id: [0x000CF102]
There you are, my dear! I was worried about you.

Id: [0x000CF104]
Oh, by Dionysos! I remember. I went to the island because of her!

Id: [0x000CF106]
She… She got me drunk, married me, and told me I owed her a "virginity tax." Whose virginity?

Id: [0x000CF108]
You can go. This is between me and my husband.

Id: [0x000CF109]
No, no… no! No, don't-- don't go. They'll kill me.

Id: [0x000CF222]
(sobbing)

Id: [0x000CF223]
Has your father left us?

Id: [0x000CF224]
His good life is over. He was too weak to live 'til your return.

Id: [0x000CF225]
May he be conducted in peace.

Id: [0x000CF227]
Old man, your Book. May it guide you to your wife's side.

Id: [0x000CF22E]
It is a shame to see three dead left neglected. What happened?

Id: [0x000CF22F]
They were just brought here, Medjay. A family struck down by the sword…

Id: [0x000CF232]
Only the daughter, Iras, survived. She carried them here one by one.

Id: [0x000CF235]
Poor girl… all by herself now. A tragic story.

Id: [0x000CF254]
I guess stealing something that was stolen is not really stealing?

Id: [0x000CF362]
Find the girl!

Id: [0x000CF364]
We won't lose her this time.

Id: [0x000CF365]
Let's finish this quickly! I have a pig roasting at the villa.

Id: [0x000CF366]
The first to find her will get an extra ration of beer!

Id: [0x000CF367]
Sophronios will reward us for today's work!

Id: [0x000CF3BA]
Is your life full of narrow escapes?

Id: [0x000CF3BB]
It would seem that way.

Id: [0x000CF3BC]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x000CF3BD]
It's as you said -- quite the crusade for a herder. This quest is safer in your hands, as you've just proven. I fear I've become as foolish as my father instructed me not to be. Thank you, whoever you are.

Id: [0x000CF3BE]
Sophronios. Yet another man made butcher for the sake of wealth.

Id: [0x000CF45D]
Strange to see bodies left out like this.

Id: [0x000CF45E]
The embalmer must know more.

Id: [0x000CF48E]
A pitiful end to a pitiful existence.

Id: [0x000CF59C]
[sobbing]

Id: [0x000CF59D]
Keba? What in the name of the gods are you doing down there?

Id: [0x000CF59E]
I wanted to hide, but now I can't get back out... I'm scared.

Id: [0x000CF59F]
Stay calm. I will help you out of there.

Id: [0x000CF5A0]
This way, through the tunnel.

Id: [0x000CF5A1]
Thank you, Uncle Bayek!

Id: [0x000CF5A2]
Go straight home to your mother. She will be worried.

Id: [0x000CF5A3]
You found me. Your turn to hide!

Id: [0x000CF5A4]
Come away from there, Nailah. You're getting in the priests' way.

Id: [0x000CF5BB]
Here we are. At the pyramids.

Id: [0x000CF5BC]
This is where we do our offerings. See, everything is missing.

Id: [0x000CF5BD]
I see. Maybe we should look around. I see trash going in this direction. I hear sounds from behind the pyramid.

Id: [0x000CF5BE]
Let's go and see.

Id: [0x000CF5C2]
This is line 1

Id: [0x000CF5C3]
This is line 2

Id: [0x000CF5C4]
This is line 3

Id: [0x000CF5CB]
test1

Id: [0x000CF5CC]
test2

Id: [0x000CF5CD]
test3

Id: [0x000CF61A]
The race is over, but where is my Greek Racer Friend? You there, shady individual, where is my friend?

Id: [0x000CF61B]
I saw you friend taken away by loan sharks in a cage. They are taking him back to their camp.

Id: [0x000CF61C]
Thank you, shady individual. Your vague and unwarranted advice will help me save my fleshy friend.

Id: [0x000CF661]
I am but one in the Order of Ancients. This victory will bring you no peace!

Id: [0x000CF66C]
The Order of Ancients will remember me as the bringer of waters and a builder of cities!

Id: [0x000CF673]
Or the desert will blow in… and scatter the dream of Letopolis like dust.

Id: [0x000CF70E]
I need (X) iron. If you helps me, WorkshopOwner reduced (X%) of the prize.

Id: [0x000CF70F]
I need an item. If you helps me, WorkshopOwner reduced (X%) of the prize.

Id: [0x000CF710]
You can find the item in the ptolemaic boat.

Id: [0x000CF711]
Thanks for the item. You deserve the reduction!

Id: [0x000CF71A]
A man who fights as well as you can perhaps afford to be trusting.

Id: [0x000CF71B]
Talk, or you will meet the same fate as your friends.

Id: [0x000CF71C]
That will not be necessary.

Id: [0x000CF71D]
Among the dunes southeast of here is the bandit camp where the fake mummies are made.

Id: [0x000CF71E]
Better I smash the camp than your head.

Id: [0x000CF71F]
It's me Seer, I brought him back. Where do you want me to drop him?

Id: [0x000CF720]
Anywhere near my table, i'll work my magic on him!

Id: [0x000CF721]
My friend! I am glad to see you have kept our appointment.

Id: [0x000CF722]
Who is behind the traffic of false icons?

Id: [0x000CF723]
"Pity the trusting man, for he suffers great pain."

Id: [0x000CF724]
Ah, here you are!

Id: [0x000CF725]
I have dealt with the trafficking of false mummies.

Id: [0x000CF727]
Heh, how can I ease the burdens of an old friend.

Id: [0x000CF728]
Tonight we will stage a grand spectacle. Our goddess Sekhmet defends the people against Isfet's chaos.

Id: [0x000CF729]
But Pamu, our champion, is nowhere to be found! The high priest will judge me responsible for his absence!

Id: [0x000CF72B]
I'll have a look.

Id: [0x000CF72D]
Sekhmet bless you! His home is near the market... but check the tavern first.

Id: [0x000CF782]
How do you come to know my name?

Id: [0x000CF783]
A priest told me of you.

Id: [0x000CF786]
My kin have owned this land for centuries, but left it barren until now.

Id: [0x000CF787]
A soldier came to us, saying his master held a deed of sale.

Id: [0x000CF788]
My father refused to concede the property. Then… Well, the rest is as you know it.

Id: [0x000CF789]
What will you do?

Id: [0x000CF78A]
The farm is my birthright. I will work it as long as I can.

Id: [0x000CF78B]
I can ensure you are not harassed by soldiers.

Id: [0x000CF78C]
You may try. The villa they spoke of lies northwest of here, on the road to Alexandria.

Id: [0x000CF78E]
If you fail, tell the world I died preserving my family's legacy!

Id: [0x000CF7D3]
Your Holiness, I am here to fight for Sekhmet.

Id: [0x000CF7D4]
Fine. Follow me.

Id: [0x000CF7EF]
...wha... where am I? I feel terrible... This sandstorm isn't normal.

Id: [0x000CF7F0]
I see light over the ridge, better follow it to find refuge.

Id: [0x000CF7F1]
Ah Bayek! So good of you to come by. We've been waiting for you.

Id: [0x000CF7F2]
I don't... where am I? Who are you?

Id: [0x000CF7F3]
Tss tss, now now, no time for questions, you don't have much time.

Id: [0x000CF7F4]
Your friends are lost in the storm and you enemies are burning with a desire to see you suffer. Better hurry now!

Id: [0x000CF7F5]
Take this weapon. You might find it coming handy where you're going.

Id: [0x000CF7F8]
Bayek! Over here!

Id: [0x000CF7F9]
Aya? Is that you? Are you alright? You shouldn't be here!

Id: [0x000CF7FA]
There are men in the storm looking for you, they'll kill us if they find us.

Id: [0x000CF7FB]
I can't walk. Take me to the refuge, we should be safe there.

Id: [0x000CF7FC]
There was a man here, where is he?

Id: [0x000CF7FD]
Bayek, the storm is getting stronger, get us to safety!

Id: [0x000CF7FE]
Does this entertain you?! Come out, whereever you are!

Id: [0x000CF7FF]
BAAAYEK! BAAAAAYEK! BAAAAAA...

Id: [0x000CF800]
Baaaaaaaah. Baaaaaaaaah.

Id: [0x000CF801]
...What's this? Aya! Where are you?? Get off me you fetid beast. 

Id: [0x000CF802]
Baaaah... baaaaaaa...

Id: [0x000CF803]
What the FUCK was that about.

Id: [0x000CF910]
What are your plans now, Tahira?

Id: [0x000CF911]
Sobek is not done with me yet, and thus he still has use for you. Are you game?

Id: [0x000CF912]
I have much to do. What more do you need?

Id: [0x000CF913]
The Roman hunters still infest this area like maggots. In time, they will come together and undo our work. They will consume everything.

Id: [0x000CF914]
But if we strike now, while they are alone and separated, we may bloody them enough to drive them off.

Id: [0x000CF915]
I would not ask, otherwise.

Id: [0x000CF927]
Look at you, wrinkled from water and groggy from wine.

Id: [0x000CF93C]
How will I find Aya among all these endless scrolls?

Id: [0x000CF942]
You, neb, are young and your legs are strong. Perfect for my needs.

Id: [0x000CF944]
If I see her...

Id: [0x000CF945]
Never mind her. I want my letter. Run up to the Pigeon Tower and fetch it. All news is important to us these days.

Id: [0x000CF947]
All right, steward. I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x000CF949]
Isfet was once husband to Ma'at, Goddess of Order.

Id: [0x000CF94B]
Ma'at cast him out of the Hall of Justice. In his hunger, he returned.

Id: [0x000CF94C]
But Sekhmet knew his heart, and guarded the door against him.

Id: [0x000CF94D]
Warrior of Sekhmet, stand proud!

Id: [0x000CF94E]
Sekhmet breaths heat into her warrior!

Id: [0x000CF94F]
See how Sekhmet imbues her beloved with power!<LF>

Id: [0x000CF952]
HELLLLLP!!!!

Id: [0x000CF970]
[Paúe!](Leave me alone!) Foulest of foul beasts…

Id: [0x000CF971]
Let me be… me in peace!

Id: [0x000CF972]
You will get no more food from me! There is none left!

Id: [0x000CF973]
And here is Klaudios.

Id: [0x000CF9FB]
I seek the master brewer, Harkuf.

Id: [0x000CF9FC]
I have no time. Speak to one of my overseers, if you must.

Id: [0x000CF9FD]
You misunderstand. I am a Medjay. Apollodorus sent me.

Id: [0x000CF9FE]
Apollodorus! Of course.

Id: [0x000CFA2B]
But these are only stories.

Id: [0x000CFA2C]
Tales of mutilations, disappearances, and folk buried in the desert and left to die.

Id: [0x000CFA87]
Come with me. Let us retire where we have a roof overhead.

Id: [0x000CFA88]
He sent me for the Scarab, the shadow that darkens Sais.

Id: [0x000CFA89]
Shh! Please! That is an evil name to speak aloud!

Id: [0x000CFAD8]
Psst! Bayek! PSSSSSSTT!

Id: [0x000CFAD9]
PSSSSSST!!!!

Id: [0x000CFADA]
...Why...Are you...Hiding...In the WC...?

Id: [0x000CFADB]
I sense someone is watching me, I'm sure it's hetepi who sent someone after me!

Id: [0x000CFADC]
Stay here, i'll look around...

Id: [0x000CFADD]
May Ahmes the fruit-seller's heart be eaten by--

Id: [0x000CFADE]
Hello, friend! Bread for your sweetheart?

Id: [0x000CFADF]
No, thank you. Why do you speak a curse under your breath?

Id: [0x000CFAE1]
The magician who sold it to me said I must recite it two hundred times a day.

Id: [0x000CFAE2]
Though it is hard to get any baking done without my taster!

Id: [0x000CFB0B]
I've gotten word that Venator is planning an attempt on the Queen's life. 

Id: [0x000CFB0C]
We must act quickly. What have you learned? How can I find them ?

Id: [0x000CFB0D]
If they do work for Caius, they'll have the mark of the Gabagiani on them. Look for that. 

Id: [0x000CFB0E]
Also, look at this place, anyone who isnt drunk and or naked is certainly up to something, so keep an eye out. 

Id: [0x000CFB0F]
I'll check the city. you head back and keep an eye on Cleopatra.

Id: [0x000CFB43]
Ready to see our beautiful temple?

Id: [0x000CFB44]
After you, Menehet… or is it "Servant of the Goddess"?

Id: [0x000CFB45]
"Menehet" will do for one as good as family.

Id: [0x000CFB48]
Oh, not staying? Well, you know where I may be found.

Id: [0x000CFB4B]
Ah, you are back. On with the tour!

Id: [0x000CFB79]
What's this? Scented oils. Might take the edge of the tanner's stench.

Id: [0x000CFBA2]
As I foresaw, war. Flavius, they want fire, let us burn the whole damn harbour.

Id: [0x000D021A]
The city of Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC, during his campaign to conquer Egypt. It would become the capital of his successor's dynasty for the next three hundred years.

Id: [0x000D021C]
Alexandria was mostly populated by large waves of Greek immigrants, then known as Hellenes.

Id: [0x000D021E]
The effect of massive immigration phases and vastly successful economic integrations of new arrivals brought the city up to 400,000 inhabitants.

Id: [0x000D0222]
Theater was a very important facet of the cultural life of Greek residents in Alexandria. The largest theater of the time could host up to 11,000 people.

Id: [0x000D0224]
When used for its democratic function, the theater space was occupied by the town council, referred to as boule.

Id: [0x000D0226]
The architecture of this structure is Roman in style. This is because we duplicated a theater from Cyrene, a city further west from this location.

Id: [0x000D022A]
Gymnasiums were an integral part of the Greek philosophical tradition, which required its students to exercise in lush outdoor areas.

Id: [0x000D022C]
In the Gymnasium, students were taught not only sports, but also topics such as rhetoric, philosophy, music and poetry – all things deemed essential to one's education at the time.

Id: [0x000D022E]
Here, both girls and boys are shown attending a class given by one of the rhetoricians of the era.

Id: [0x000D0232]
We are now standing in front of the Paneion, the Temple of Pan.

Id: [0x000D0234]
Half-goat, half-man, Pan was the Greek god of the wild. His origins are obscure, though they can be traced to Egyptian mythology.

Id: [0x000D0236]
The comedy witnessed earlier during the Theater tour featured the god Pan as its mischievous narrator.

Id: [0x000D023A]
In this location you can see the many stalls where local merchandises and imported products were sold.

Id: [0x000D023C]
While Egypt did not produce much hard wood, it could trade resources such as wheat and papyrus for it.

Id: [0x000D023E]
Banking was one of the most distinctive new asset brought by the Greeks to Egypt.

Id: [0x000D0242]
Facing the Mareotis lake, the southern port was the biggest in Alexandria.

Id: [0x000D0244]
The Mareotis port used to be linked with Alexandria through a canal, though it is not represented in the game due to its size.

Id: [0x000D0246]
By the 12th century, the canal lost most of its water in provenance of the Nile, terminating its connection to the Mediterranean. Without a fresh supply of water, it slowly evaporated to near extinction.

Id: [0x000D024A]
Tanning, a process which dates from prehistoric times, was present although not highly valued in Egypt due to the heat.

Id: [0x000D024C]
Valued for its coolness and freshness in hot weather, linen was the fiber most commonly used for fabrics and textiles. It was produced from flax, which was plentiful in Egypt.

Id: [0x000D024E]
Various shades were achieved using woad, a dye produced from the leaves of Isatis Tinctoria.

Id: [0x000D0252]
Before you stands the great synagogue of Alexandria.

Id: [0x000D0254]
The architecture style used by the Jewish community of Alexandria was mostly Greek, as seen through the use of the mosaic floors and tiles roofs. So were many aspects of their lifestyle.

Id: [0x000D0256]
Much is known regarding the history of the Alexandrian Jewish community during the Ptolemaic era. This is due to the writings of a Jewish historian named Josepo, or if one uses his Latin name, Flavius Josephus.

Id: [0x000D025A]
The main street of Alexandria, the Canopic Way, cut through the heart of the city, from east to west. It was five miles in length.

Id: [0x000D025C]
This structure, known as the Canopic Door, led to the town of Canope, which you can find at the end of this road.

Id: [0x000D025E]
The width of the street, thirty meters, was abnormally large even by Greek standards.

Id: [0x000D0262]
The Greek may have come to Egypt in order to claim the title of Pharaoh, but counter-acculturation played a great role in the following centuries.

Id: [0x000D0264]
The Greek considered Egypt to be the place of origin of many gods. As such, Egyptian cults were respected, and flourished under Greek rule. <LF><LF>

Id: [0x000D0266]
The Egyptian mummification rituals greatly influenced the Greek cult of the dead, which used to favor burial and cremation.

Id: [0x000D0268]
Ye hymns that rule the lyre! What god, what hero, aye, and what man shall we loudly praise? Verily Zeus is the lord of Pisa; and Heracles established the Olympic festival, (…) while Thêrôn must be proclaimed by reason of his victorious chariot with its four hourses, Thêrôn who is just in his regard for guests, and who is the bulwark of Acragas, the choicest flower of an auspicious line of sires, whose city towers on high, (…) bringing wealth and glory to crown their native merits.

Id: [0x000D026A]
The Hippodrome was where the main events of the Greek games took place. This included chariot racing, and athletics such as foot races.

Id: [0x000D026C]
Alexandria's hippodrome was known as the Lageion. Its track was roughly 560m long and was as large as would one day become the Circus Maximus in Rome.

Id: [0x000D026E]
The most important chariot race was the tethrippon. Using four horses, with the quickest harnessed to the front right, the charioteer would race for twelve laps, with sharp turns at either end of the hippodrome.

Id: [0x000D09E8]
I need (X) wood. If you helps me, WorkshopOwner reduced (X%) of the prize.

Id: [0x000D0A13]
Shame the captain killed the chariot maker. His work was masterful.

Id: [0x000D0A14]
Don't cry for these mouthy peasants.

Id: [0x000D0A15]
No, I was just saying… Do you think his widow is still running their shop?

Id: [0x000D0A16]
Why? Do you fancy her? You into short, older women?

Id: [0x000D0B9B]
A favor. Some customers of mine took my horse after a dispute. Their camp lies in a quarry just south of here.

Id: [0x000D0B9D]
You'll get it for me... If Apollodorus wants my continued service.

Id: [0x000D0E76]
Slipped my mind!

Id: [0x000D0E77]
I thought you said it was yours...

Id: [0x000D0E78]
Ahem, yes! Yes of course it is! You've done good by me, my friend.

Id: [0x000D0E79]
Then you'll deliver as promised.

Id: [0x000D0E7A]
My word is my word... but I've one more thing to ask of you.

Id: [0x000D0E7B]
Ack, I'm done with your games.

Id: [0x000D0E7C]
All right... The Hyena lives in a cavern just over those hills.

Id: [0x000D0EF1]
What is this?

Id: [0x000D0EF2]
All your promises of a stronger Egypt, an abundant afterlife, were lies.

Id: [0x000D0EF6]
Curse the king. And curse the Ptolemies.

Id: [0x000D0FFB]
There was a lot of hyenas around here... footsteps are still fresh.

Id: [0x000D0FFC]
This guy has been completly ripped by some animals... 

Id: [0x000D0FFD]
Shot in the back... It feels like he go caught by suprise... Why was this guy hiding behind there?

Id: [0x000D0FFE]
Someone was hurt and dragged himself on the ground...

Id: [0x000D0FFF]
The blood trail leads to a small gap under the wall.

Id: [0x000D100C]
That is the way.

Id: [0x000D100D]
Over there.

Id: [0x000D100E]
That way, my friend.

Id: [0x000D1013]
No! This is not real. That is not me!

Id: [0x000D1014]
I will not die today.

Id: [0x000D1015]
Not this. The gods have plans for me.

Id: [0x000D113B]
Bayek, while we have exposition talk, let us wet our feet in the natron water.

Id: [0x000D113C]
Yes.

Id: [0x000D113D]
This feels good.

Id: [0x000D113E]
SKREEEEEEEEEEEE

Id: [0x000D113F]
What the hells was that sound? Let's go and see.

Id: [0x000D11D6]
Is someone really sleeping here among the hyenas?

Id: [0x000D11D7]
How could this food supply survived with all those animals around? 

Id: [0x000D11D8]
Some funeral artefacts over here... I wonder why...

Id: [0x000D11D9]
This book of the dead was intented for a young girl... Creepy.

Id: [0x000D11DA]
Is that for hyena breeding? Or maybe that cage is hidding something else... To protect something?

Id: [0x000D11DB]
I see what happened.

Id: [0x000D11DC]
Help, I'm a wounded man and I can't get up. Take me to the healers.

Id: [0x000D11DD]
Yes. I will carry you to the healer.

Id: [0x000D11EA]
You, father of the wounded man, go to his side.

Id: [0x000D11EB]
Yes. But my cart broke and now all my things are on the ground. Can you pick them up while I see my son?

Id: [0x000D11EC]
Yes. Come, Greek Racer Friend, let us carry the blocks.

Id: [0x000D11EF]
Bayek, you came. I met some good boys who were nice enough to just give me money, just like that! For free! Can you imagine?

Id: [0x000D11F0]
Bayek doesn't imagine. What do you need money for?

Id: [0x000D11F1]
For the race, Bayek! I bet everything on myself. With my treatment, I'm sure to win this, baby!

Id: [0x000D11F2]
We're just waiting for one last rider. Hey, maybe you should join! Witness firsthand my tight racing skills!

Id: [0x000D11F3]
The race exists at all time in the world. The Greek cannot win, regardless what happens.

Id: [0x000D1200]
Exposition talk

Exposition Talk 002

Id: [0x000D1221]
A golden statue of Sobek. It is beautiful. The boy tells the truth.

Id: [0x000D1223]
A golden statue of Sobek, beautifully made. Just as the boy said it would be.

Id: [0x000D1320]
This is a beast den. I should investigate.

Id: [0x000D1321]
I see hyena dejections. These are no jackals, this is a hyena den.

Id: [0x000D1322]
I see shredded baskets that contained meat. These must have attracted the beasts on the ridge near the shrine.

Id: [0x000D1323]
I see a dead horse loaded with packs. There are charms in the packs and a bill for the mine. These were to protect the workers.

Id: [0x000D1324]
I should deliver the charms to the quartermaster.

Id: [0x000D133A]
Holy Anubis! What is this?! This seems from another world...

Id: [0x000D133B]
There is so much silica over here... What could it be used for? Was Mered selling this to Khaliset?

Id: [0x000D133C]
This is... a young girl's mummy?! What the "land of the dead" was Khaliset was doing in here? ...This makes me sad and that reminds me of my son, Khemu...

Id: [0x000D133D]
Healer: "Let's ride! We need to leave this canyon. Be wary of the wild animals and try to keep up."

Id: [0x000D133E]
Healer: "What are you doing here? You were supposed to wait for us at the tower with the others."

Id: [0x000D133F]
You were running late. I came to make sure everything was alright and was attacked by wild beasts. Who's he?

Id: [0x000D1340]
Nekenieh thought you would need extra muscle for this.

Id: [0x000D1341]
Indeed we do, these roads are far from safe. Put me on your horse and let's return to the tower.

Id: [0x000D134D]
Look out, Ptolemies! The brazier must have attracted them. Brace yourselves!

Id: [0x000D134F]
On our way to Djoser Pyramid

Id: [0x000D1350]
We have exposition talk.

Id: [0x000D136F]
Master Taharqa? My name is Bayek, from Siwa.

Id: [0x000D1372]
I am indeed Taharqa, grand planner of Sais and steward of Letopolis.

Id: [0x000D1373]
I met your family. Your wife sent me here. She said you might know about the one called the Scarab.

Id: [0x000D138A]
Can you give the materials? Don't worry, this man is the best in town.

Id: [0x000D138B]
Let me see... Interesting, I don't think I've ever had to work with this kind of material before.

Id: [0x000D138C]
Aya briefed me with the plans, it shouldn't take too long.

Id: [0x000D138D]
I had time to work on the mechanism while you were gone, it should work like a charm.

Id: [0x000D138E]
Here you go!

Id: [0x000D13A9]
A friend sent me here. I'm looking for a type of metal that is really resistant and light.

Id: [0x000D13AA]
May I ask what for? For a necklace? A ring perhaps?

Id: [0x000D13AB]
Euh something like that, a bracele- 

Id: [0x000D13AC]
Who am I kidding, keep those reasons for youself. My clients' anonymity is always kept to myself

Id: [0x000D13AD]
Something resistant and light?

Id: [0x000D13AE]
I have just the thing for you! I had, I mean. The Ptolemaics do now, actually.

Id: [0x000D13AF]
They just seized my entire cargo after I "refused" to "pay" them the "fee". Nonsense if you ask me.

Id: [0x000D13B0]
They will be transfering this cargo by cart from the smaller garrison north of here to the bigger one near the hebraic district.

Id: [0x000D13B1]
That's where they all keep their stocks.

Id: [0x000D13B2]
I'll see if I can track the cargo.

Id: [0x000D13B3]
Since these will be raw materials, they will need a bit of work but don't worry, I know a good blacksmith in the hebraic district.

Id: [0x000D13B4]
I'll meet you there.

Id: [0x000D13EE]
Ishnu dal dieb.

Shaha Lor'ma.

Id: [0x000D13F5]
Taharqa. Where can I find him?

Id: [0x000D13F6]
Master Taharqa is always working. You can find him at his house.

Id: [0x000D1436]
Bayek, while we're here, there's something I want to show you.

Id: [0x000D1437]
Behold! My prized horse Hippokrates, he's my pride and joy.

Id: [0x000D1438]
I see you're quite the horse enthusiast. You might be interested to know they're holding horse races down at the Djoser pyramid. You could make a pretty penny betting on the competition.

Id: [0x000D1439]
Betting? I shall do more than that... I will win the race for myself! Show these sand boys how we handle things in Alexandria.

Id: [0x000D143A]
ONWARDS! TO THE PYRAMID, HIPPOKRATES!

Id: [0x000D1462]
Khaliset... Attacked us...

Id: [0x000D1463]
Where did she goes?

Id: [0x000D1464]
Look for her in the pyramids... The object you have found will open the way! ...Now, I'm dying...

Id: [0x000D1466]
Introduction of the Green Faction Chief.

Id: [0x000D1467]
Bayek accepted by Green Faction.

Id: [0x000D1468]
Let's go to the Hippodrome !

[Gasping]The Lizard. The priest who cursed Memphis.

Id: [0x000D146B]
Old Egypt asks a heavy price!

Id: [0x000D1470]
You are one of them, Bayek.

Id: [0x000D1489]
Keep going that way.

Id: [0x000D148A]
There!

Id: [0x000D148B]
That is the path.

Id: [0x000D148C]
That's the right way.

Id: [0x000D148D]
There, over there!

Id: [0x000D148E]
Keep going.

Id: [0x000D148F]
Keep going, through the sands.

Id: [0x000D1490]
There, that's right, my friend!

Id: [0x000D1491]
That way, warrior.

Id: [0x000D1492]
Keep going, friend, don't falter.

Id: [0x000D1493]
You're nearly there!

Id: [0x000D1494]
This way, warrior, this way!

Id: [0x000D1495]
Go over there, that's it.

Id: [0x000D1496]
There, brave warrior, there.

Id: [0x000D1497]
That way, over the sands.

Id: [0x000D1498]
Come, my friend.

Id: [0x000D1499]
Follow me, friend.

Id: [0x000D149A]
This way, come, come.

Id: [0x000D14A1]
I will lead you, come, my friend.

Id: [0x000D14A2]
Follow me, I will guide you.

Id: [0x000D14A3]
This way, this way.

This way, come.

Id: [0x000D14C5]
Come with me, my friend.

Id: [0x000D14C6]
I will lead you through, friend.

Id: [0x000D14C7]
This way, this way.

Id: [0x000D14C8]
Come, do not falter.

Id: [0x000D14C9]
Follow me through the sands.

Id: [0x000D14CA]
Come, this way.

Id: [0x000D14CB]
Come, come, I will guide you.

Id: [0x000D14CC]
Just follow me, my friend.

Id: [0x000D14CD]
This is the path.

Id: [0x000D14DE]
Salve, Lord Caesar. I will make the order.

Id: [0x000D150C]
Help me! This man has lost his reason!

Id: [0x000D150D]
I am the Royal Scribe!

Id: [0x000D150E]
I've been attacked by a madman!

Id: [0x000D1511]
Eudoros has been killed!

Id: [0x000D1513]
Septimius will crucify us!

Id: [0x000D1565]
Follow me.

Id: [0x000D1566]
If this is indeed from Ma'at, let me deal with Apepi.

Id: [0x000D1567]
We have lost many ... I too lost my husband and was made to serve Apepi thereafter. Our people have suffered enough under his oppression and he must pay for it.

Id: [0x000D1568]
Now, I ask only that you see it through should I fail.

Id: [0x000D157B]
And before you go, I have some information that may interest you

Id: [0x000D157C]
There is a shipment of mead that I just signed off on

Id: [0x000D157D]
It is ... a particularly good batch of mead

Id: [0x000D157E]
And I hear Apepi has taken quite the interest in having his hands on one

Id: [0x000D157F]
Sounds like I have a ship to catch then

Id: [0x000D1580]
Isis watch over you, Bayek

Id: [0x000D158C]
Many of our men fought for our freedom ... even then our women were still taken away to serve under Apepi's regime.

Id: [0x000D158D]
He is losing patience and is seeking to seize control of the very thing that has been keeping us safe.

Id: [0x000D158E]
And how do you intend to stop him?

Id: [0x000D158F]
By giving him what he wants.

Id: [0x000D1590]
Take this, I trust you will know what to do with it.

Id: [0x000D1591]
We're near that dog, Apepi.

Id: [0x000D1592]
He's enjoying himself but he knows well that he has made enough enemies to warrant protection even on the very thing he indulges in.

Id: [0x000D1593]
I'll see to it that Apepi's eyes are blinded.

Id: [0x000D16A7]
Are you ready Apollodorus ?

Id: [0x000D16A8]
Ah Bayek ! Yes, I received the information I wanted. Come to my farm to discuss.

Id: [0x000D16A9]
Drive and Talk with Apollodorus to his farm.

Id: [0x000D17C6]
Ah. There you are, Bayek. 

Id: [0x000D17C7]
I've taken care of that business in the east.

Id: [0x000D17C8]
Brilliant. Cleopatra would like to speak with you. 

Id: [0x000D17C9]
Lead the way.

Id: [0x000D17CA]
All set? 

Id: [0x000D17CB]
I'll  be here when you're ready!

Id: [0x000D1C9D]
Nailah, are you following me?

Id: [0x000D1C9E]
You might get lost without me. It's a big temple!

Id: [0x000D1C9F]
Your father wants you to go home.

Id: [0x000D1CA0]
And I prefer to stay with you!

Id: [0x000D1CA1]
Are you going to sleep at our house again?

Id: [0x000D1CA2]
Not this time, but I hope to pass by and visit your mother.

Id: [0x000D1CA3]
My father is never at home these days.

Id: [0x000D1CA5]
He has too much work with people coming from all over.

Id: [0x000D1CA7]
I can't wait for the festival! We will see the gods fighting.

Id: [0x000D1CA9]
Oh, really?

Id: [0x000D1CAA]
Yes! Everybody will be there.

Id: [0x000D1CAC]
Bye, Bayek! I'm going home. I'm hungry!

Id: [0x000D1CC4]
Tell me of the fake mummies being sold here.

Id: [0x000D1CC5]
I have no desire to be dragged into this.

Id: [0x000D1CC6]
Menehet sends me. Your silence is an insult to his holy office.

Id: [0x000D1CC7]
Er, I wish to anger neither him nor the gods.

Id: [0x000D1CC9]
We are forced to sell items of lesser quality, or see our stalls destroyed.

Id: [0x000D1CCA]
Who is behind this?

Id: [0x000D1CCB]
I can say no more now. Let us meet tonight, where the village turns to farmland.

Id: [0x000D1D22]
Oh , oh !!

Id: [0x000D1D23]
Point report... REPORT!

Id: [0x000D1D24]
Dammit! There are more!!?

Id: [0x000D1D25]
Alright. I think that's all of them.

Id: [0x000D1D26]
WAKE UP!!

Id: [0x000D1D27]
No sudden moves!

Id: [0x000D1D28]
Laila... Laila!! Wake Up!!

Id: [0x000D1D29]
I'm here. What is it? What's wrong?

Id: [0x000D1D2A]
I just got a call.  Told me that someone is tracking me. Watching what we're doing.

Id: [0x000D1D2B]
! Who's watching. And who called you?

Id: [0x000D1D2C]
No idea. But I ran a scan and he's right! Someone has been piggy backing on your signal.

Id: [0x000D1D2D]
Dammit! Do they know where I am?

Id: [0x000D1D2E]
You? No. I dont think so. Not yet at least, but...Someone's here. They're.........

Id: [0x000D1D2F]
Alfred?! ....Alfred!!!!

Id: [0x000D1D30]
...Fuck!

Id: [0x000D1D31]
Crap! I'll need to get more lights from the Jeep.

Id: [0x000D1D32]
I hope Alfred's alright.

Id: [0x000D1D50]
Trade is strangled, the soldiers run rampant, and the weight of Ptolemy's taxation crushes the breath from us.

Id: [0x000D1D75]
Welcome to Mered's Wares, traveler.

Id: [0x000D1D79]
Well? What do you think?

Id: [0x000D1D7A]
Junk.

Id: [0x000D1D7C]
Be off, then.

Id: [0x000D1D7D]
Ah, I haven't finished.

Id: [0x000D1D7E]
Are you blind? I've nothing left to show you.

Id: [0x000D1D80]
Ha, funny indeed.

Id: [0x000D1D88]
Now what can you tell me?

Id: [0x000D1D89]
The Hyena... is not her real name.

Id: [0x000D1D8B]
Hahahaha! Easy, easy! A poor attempt at humor, I'm afraid. Her name is Khaliset.

Id: [0x000D1D8C]
Where can I find her?

Id: [0x000D1D90]
Take my men, retrieve my horse, and I'll give you what you came for.

Id: [0x000D1D91]
Agh, how you found yourself in Apollodorus' company escapes me.

Id: [0x000D1D99]
If I find you've led me on another futile chase, it won't be my words that hit your ears.

Id: [0x000D1D9A]
A thousand promises. I have no reason to defy you.

Id: [0x000D1DC3]
The last man who asked questions about the Scarab was near beaten to death, with his tongue cut out.

Id: [0x000D1DC4]
Hmm. Who was he?

Id: [0x000D1DC5]
Old Ghupa… Father-in-law to the most powerful man in the region, Taharqa.

Id: [0x000D1DC8]
Eh, you tired of winning?

Id: [0x000D1DC9]
No. He left on the road to Camp Pyrrhos. He should have been home by now.

Id: [0x000D1DCE]
I'll see if I can find him along the road.

Id: [0x000D1DD4]
Khaliset is not just collecting silica for The Order. Whatever she's up to, it can't be good. This uncertainty troubles me.

Id: [0x000D1DDE]
There are real villains in Sais...but the Scarab? If he exists it is not safe to speak of him.

Id: [0x000D1DE8]
Is your curiosity satisfied?

Id: [0x000D1DE9]
Be quicker. You disturb our work and the dead's rest.

Id: [0x000D1DEA]
Is this salt you are working with?

Id: [0x000D1DEB]
[grunts] Not salt. Natron.

Id: [0x000D1DEC]
It dries out the body… and it fries my hands to shit.

Id: [0x000D1DFD]
That boy, Kawab, is his grandson.

Id: [0x000D1DFF]
By the gods, Markos, I think you've killed him.

Id: [0x000D1E00]
No, no, he still breathes. Stupid fool. This will teach him.

Id: [0x000D1E01]
What happened to the beggar?

Id: [0x000D1E02]
The mute? Markos and Tykon beat him for sneaking around the camp. Poor bastard collapsed.

Id: [0x000D1E03]
What are we to do with the beggar that Markos caught in the [phylakitai's](officer's) tent?

Id: [0x000D1E04]
If he survives the beating the men gave him, we'll sell him at the harbor for a drachma.

Id: [0x000D257E]
Come on.

Id: [0x000D257F]
This way.

Id: [0x000D2580]
Come on, move.

Id: [0x000D2581]
This way, hurry.

Id: [0x000D2582]
Come, this way.

Id: [0x000D2583]
Come.

Id: [0x000D2584]
Come on.

Id: [0x000D2585]
Hurry my love.

Id: [0x000D2586]
Come, this way.

Id: [0x000D2587]
Over here.

Id: [0x000D2594]
Did you know he was mute?

Id: [0x000D2595]
Perhaps half a drachma, then.

Id: [0x000D25D4]
Oho! Vanquished by a gang of ruffians, silent as (ghosts)[khefts]!

Id: [0x000D25D5]
Uncle Bayek! Uncle Bayek!

Id: [0x000D25D6]
Jewels of my life, why have you left your mother's side?

Id: [0x000D25D8]
See now, there's no need to attack a man from behind when outnumbering him four to one.

Id: [0x000D25D9]
You told us to… secure every advantage possible over a dangerous foe.

Id: [0x000D25DA]
Yes, yes, yes… and I am very dangerous!

Id: [0x000D25E1]
Hide well, for the Wanderer stalks your path!

Id: [0x000D2610]
Priest, you have proven as false as your mummies!

Id: [0x000D261A]
Look at this! Fraud abounds in your market, and you claim you can do nothing?

Id: [0x000D261B]
The dealings of the market are beyond me. Speak rather to the offending merchant.

Id: [0x000D2620]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000D2627]
You're not Pamu. He was meant to play Sekhmet.

Id: [0x000D2628]
Pamu is… ill. He's recovering at the temple.

Id: [0x000D263B]
[groan]

Id: [0x000D263F]
Beloved of Sekhmet, who illumines the Double Land with her flame…

Id: [0x000D2640]
We unveil to you a ritual that has guarded us for century upon century.

Id: [0x000D2659]
We give thanks for your presence on this sacred night.

Id: [0x000D265A]
We invite your witness on the solemnity of our customs.

Id: [0x000D265C]
For about five years, really.

Id: [0x000D265D]
[chuckles]

Id: [0x000D265E]
Make every eye to look upon the warrior for whom the two skies open. Sekhmet, Lady of Slaughter!

Id: [0x000D2660]
The light rises with Sekhmet and falls as she falls.

Id: [0x000D2661]
Should malice cling too strongly to your hearts, Isfet, the Evil One…

Id: [0x000D2664]
[intimidating roar]

Id: [0x000D2665]
Let the battle begin!

Id: [0x000D268A]
Apollodorus knows the people are suffering. In my position, many confide in me.

Id: [0x000D269D]
There are many terrible stories about the Scarab, I am sure Apollodorus told you.

Id: [0x000D26BB]
Beast, you will meet your end at the hands of the mighty gladiator, Soris!

Id: [0x000D26BD]
Yah! Hiii-yah! First blood!

Id: [0x000D26C7]
This is where Khaliset slept, protected from sandstorms.

Id: [0x000D26CD]
Now why would one of her loyal beasts be caged?

Id: [0x000D2E34]
Stranger, you shouldn't have come here. Go on, get rid of the body, we will handle this loose end.

Id: [0x000D2E36]
Sekhmet's warrior is victorious! Our hearts are gladdened by the Lady of Protection!

Id: [0x000D2E3A]
I could swear you were the Blood-Eater herself!

Id: [0x000D2E3E]
Would that you'd agree to stay with us longer... but I know that greater duties call you.

Id: [0x000D2E41]
Go forth, hidden in the Goddess's flame, and explore the many delights our humble village has to offer!

Id: [0x000D2E58]
Ha! The priest's recounting of the battle between the Goddess and Isfet was new to me.

Id: [0x000D2E59]
It is a tale of his own invention! You will not hear it outside Yamu.

Id: [0x000D2E5A]
I'll say goodbye to the children before I leave.

Id: [0x000D2E5B]
Do so; they'll miss you.

Id: [0x000D2E9D]
A letter. The symbol of the Snake is on it.

Id: [0x000D2EA1]
This is not the place to speak, for who knows who may overhear our words? Come inside, and I will answer you.

Id: [0x000D2EA5]
You!

Id: [0x000D2EA9]
Leave the body. Get the witness. 

Id: [0x000D2EAC]
Look I told you we needed more rocks. He isn't sinking. 

Id: [0x000D2EAD]
I just don't have enough time to find the weights while you are dumping a body in a public place!

Id: [0x000D2EAE]
Next time, we get the weights first and do the killing later.

Id: [0x000D2EAF]
We are supposed to be discreet. This is anything but discreet. 

Id: [0x000D2EB0]
You shouldn't have interfered. We're going to need a lot more stones. 

Id: [0x000D2EB2]
What sort of mischief is she entertaining?

Id: [0x000D2EB3]
Foolish man, I am Iset, possessor of magic, the gods live here not you!

Id: [0x000D2EB5]
Be gone! Osiris cannot be disturbed!

Id: [0x000D2EC2]
Are you not afraid of the Scarab, Taharqa? It seems after what he did to your father-in-law…

Id: [0x000D2EC4]
What happens to poor Ghupa tears me. Whatever my life's work, whatsoever I did to bring that down upon him… I beg the gods forgive me.

Id: [0x000D2ED9]
May Ptah bless you and the protector saving me, Master Taharqa.

Id: [0x000D2EDA]
How did you end up here?

Id: [0x000D2EDD]
I was kidnapped by these blood-crazed raiders! I thought the road from Memphis to Letopolis was safe.

Id: [0x000D2F67]
My thanks to you, Bayek. Before you arrived, I thought my dream was doomed to die. You gave me the strength to hunt down these reavers.

Id: [0x000D2F6A]
Who were they?

Id: [0x000D2F6E]
Ha ha ha, enough sand to fill a lifetime! That is why we need so many to help us with our great work.

Id: [0x000D2F6F]
A parcel of land with a house to call their own. They must only help reclaim it from the desert.

Id: [0x000D2F70]
Hello, Uncle!

Id: [0x000D2F8B]
And what do you promise them, Taharqa?

Id: [0x000D2F8C]
That is all? Just dig up your house? Heh.

Id: [0x000D2F8D]
It is no simple task. We must all pitch in, to honor the gods.

Id: [0x000D2F8E]
Tampering with her Scales of Judgement, he grew fat on the souls of mortals.

Id: [0x000D2F8F]
Their battle lasted twenty days and nights before Sekhmet subdued the Lord of Chaos.

Id: [0x000D3179]
People know his vision is a true one!

Id: [0x000D317E]
It is good to honor your father, Kawab.

Id: [0x000D3182]
To the savior of Letopolis!

Id: [0x000D3187]
Mmm, let us have some honeyed dates now, and… Are you all right, Bayek?

Id: [0x000D31AD]
Pick me up, Uncle Bayek!

Id: [0x000D31BE]
May the gods be against you, Taharqa, in all that you do!

Id: [0x000D31CF]
Now, to hurry before the wind erases the tracks.

Id: [0x000D31EF]
Wait, this medallion...it belongs to Hakor...

Id: [0x000D31F0]
What happened to him? Why this guard had it with him?

Id: [0x000D31F1]
I should check his place.

Id: [0x000D3213]
First, my steel. Then, the Scarab.

Id: [0x000D3256]
So… this is how a dream dies.

Id: [0x000D325B]
It is not peace that I seek. It is not for my soul that I walk this path.

Id: [0x000D32A8]
Oh Bayek! 

Id: [0x000D339F]
We saw vultures and a hyena! And so much sand!

Id: [0x000D33BF]
Ha, yes, the gods blessed our passage.

Id: [0x000D33C9]
I must deal with Sefetu's archers in Sais. They are his eyes.

Id: [0x000D33D6]
This should do it. All I need to do now is light it.

Id: [0x000D33EB]
I don't need to tell you to be careful.

Id: [0x000D33ED]
There's blood on these linens. Someone hung these.

Id: [0x000D33F2]
This torch has fallen over. Where's the head?

Id: [0x000D33F3]
There's the torch head. It must have fallen from the ledge when the torch was tipped over.

Id: [0x000D33F5]
I remember this place.

Id: [0x000D33F8]
The torches burn with a relentless flame.

Id: [0x000D33F9]
Then I pray Anubis will grant us pardon.

Id: [0x000D33FE]
That's the last of the children.

Id: [0x000D3402]
Destroying these forgeries will earn the favor of the gods.

Id: [0x000D3403]
As Ra lives! What a disgrace.

Id: [0x000D3467]
Keep calm, Harkuf. I will get you out.

Id: [0x000D3468]
Are you Nesamun? Are you all right?

Id: [0x000D3469]
Thank Hapi, yes!

Id: [0x000D346A]
What happened?

Id: [0x000D346B]
I was bringing a delivery to Yamu when I was ambushed by these bastards!

Id: [0x000D346C]
And...?

Id: [0x000D346D]
Yes, okay, I stopped for a quick nap. But still, they drank or smashed all the beer! And threatened to kill me if I did not brew more for them!

Id: [0x000D346E]
Take the oxen back to Sais. You'll have to prepare a new delivery, I imagine. Try not to stop along the road this time.

Id: [0x000D3483]
The warrior of Sekhmet beats back chaos!

Id: [0x000D3485]
As you weaken, I grow stronger. Chaos will reign!

Id: [0x000D34C9]
What's this? Seems like a a strange concoction with a note.

Id: [0x000D34CA]
The note says "Potion of True Sight" and appears to be the complete recipe for it.

Id: [0x000D34CB]
Some of the items are already scratched off, there's also a vial half filled, which must contained half of the recipe. This seems promising, better keep it handy.

Id: [0x000D34CC]
The list has a bunch of notes and comments written all over it. All that remains are 3 ingredients and the ritual.

Id: [0x000D34CD]
"The hair of a laughing elder" refers to the hair of a grey hyena. There's an ample description here how to lure it with a corpse near its lair.

Id: [0x000D34CE]
"10 strings of the cloak of desert watchers" are in fact 10 pristine vulture feathers; any vulture will do.

Id: [0x000D34CF]
"The lettuce of Seth" is apparently a plant that grows in the desert. There are approximate notes where to find it.

Id: [0x000D34D0]
If I bring it a fresh corpse, the smell should attract it out of its den.

Id: [0x000D34D1]
[Bayek kills vultures in the wilderness]

Id: [0x000D34D2]
There, that's all 10 intact feathers. One would think vultures would earn more feathers.

Id: [0x000D34D3]
Well that sure was a hassle, all of that for a few strands of hair. Hope it's worth it.

Id: [0x000D34D6]
This seems to be the plant called the lettuce of Seth... the smell is sickening...

Id: [0x000D34D9]
The instructions tell of a temple in ruins east of the pyramid.

Id: [0x000D34DA]
There should be a hidden altar there, where the ritual has to be performed for the potion to take effect.

Id: [0x000D34DB]
Bayek performs the ritual and drinks the potion.

Id: [0x000D34DC]
He pukes and passes out.

Id: [0x000D34DD]
When Bayek wakes up, a powerful sandstorm is brewing. If he tries to escape, he gets teleported back towards his destination.

Id: [0x000D34F0]
It is done.

Id: [0x000D34F1]
So many lives turned to ash… Is anyone left?

Id: [0x000D34FC]
Osiris! Please grant me reunion. She walks alone in The Field of Reeds! Am I to remain in the Duat forever?

Id: [0x000D3516]
Follow me !

Id: [0x000D3517]
We have gathered all the documents in my office.

Id: [0x000D3518]
I'll open the doors... Two seconds...

Id: [0x000D3519]
It's open ! Come on ! And... I advise you to look at all the documents, they will be useful to you.

Id: [0x000D351A]
Harkhuf is your guy for informations about the Scarab.

Id: [0x000D351B]
Well... If he did his job... 

Id: [0x000D351C]
She seems dangerous...

Id: [0x000D351D]
Nobody knows anything about her, she must be ruthless.

Id: [0x000D351E]
You will have fun...

Id: [0x000D351F]
Do you know Sobek is the god of Fayoum ?

Id: [0x000D3520]
Maybe... Never mind.

Id: [0x000D3521]
Sorry I'm late... I had to provide informations about the Lizard.

Id: [0x000D3522]
Apollodorus think the Lizard are in Memphis but I never heard about that...

Id: [0x000D3523]
If you pass by Memphis, comes to see me.

Id: [0x000D3524]
Pasherenptah is the Hight Priest of Memphis. 

Id: [0x000D3525]
He is a great ally of Cleopatra.

Id: [0x000D3526]
Inhapi is a villager of the Red Valley  village.

Id: [0x000D3527]
She have the symbol of Apollodorus on the door of his house.

Id: [0x000D3528]
To whom do I owe for this good deed?

Id: [0x000D3529]
My name is Bayek.

Id: [0x000D352A]
Well, Bayek. I am Jeska.

Id: [0x000D352B]
Dangerous waters for a boat this size. What would compel someone to come through here?

Id: [0x000D352C]
Took a wrong turn.

Id: [0x000D352D]
I wouldn't consider avoiding naval checkpoints a wrong turn...

Id: [0x000D352E]
If I were here to kill you I would have left you up in that tree.

Id: [0x000D352F]
Fair point. What do you want?

Id: [0x000D3530]
To put an end to Sefetu. From what I hear, you can be of some help.

Id: [0x000D3531]
Help me salvage what I can.

Id: [0x000D3532]
Harkhuf has been keeping a close eye on me, hm?

Id: [0x000D3533]
You, among others.

Id: [0x000D3534]
He's a good man. Devotes much of his time to the city, when he is not brewing. I cannot tell you where Sefetu is as he has been away for some times. His men fear him, they do not want to fail him and this alone makes them very dangerous. They embody what they see and what they see is an unforgiving man.

Id: [0x000D3535]
How do you know all of this?

Id: [0x000D3536]
I was not long ago captured and held captive. Sefetu tied me up, beating and ridiculing me while his men watched. I escaped, but not before he left his mark.

Id: [0x000D3537]
How did you manage that?

Id: [0x000D3538]
Years of smuggling have given me some useful abilities.

Id: [0x000D353E]
I can wait a little.

Id: [0x000D353F]
Forgive me, neb, but access to the inner sanctum is restricted at this time.

Id: [0x000D3543]
I could have built something to last an age!

Id: [0x000D3544]
And Ghupa could have sung stories of your accomplishments.

Id: [0x000D3545]
There are things I regret! We all labor for higher powers. We are all in thrall to greater forces. There is no escape.

Id: [0x000D354F]
Hello there, old man. 

Id: [0x000D3550]
Hey! Respect your elders, young lady. 

Id: [0x000D3551]
Considering I've opened his sarcophagus, jammed a probe in him to read his mind, I think we're passed that. 

Id: [0x000D3552]
Good point

Id: [0x000D355F]
Warrior, thy spine is golden and blazes with splendor!

Id: [0x000D3561]
In thy chest glows the red heart of the Goddess's flame.

Id: [0x000D3563]
The Goddess protects her favorite from every impurity!

Id: [0x000D3565]
The Lioness's fangs will cleave the darkness!

Id: [0x000D3575]
Here's the Book of the Dead. Beka will be pleased.

Id: [0x000D3578]
I can help. I do not fear them.

Id: [0x000D3579]
I have been praying for someone like you. That Book will unite me with my wife's spirit!

Id: [0x000D357B]
I thought my heart would stop!

Id: [0x000D357C]
When their leader saw how I cared for the Book, he wrenched it from me.

Id: [0x000D357E]
Thank you. You have given me hope that I may be reunited with Isesu.

Id: [0x000D357F]
This place is amazing.

Id: [0x000D3580]
I'm amazed it's remained hidden for so long.

Id: [0x000D35D9]
We should go now, Aya.

Id: [0x000D35DA]
Sail to the bay in front of us, I know a way to get us to the docks of the Palace.

Id: [0x000D35DB]
This passage was excavated under the reign of Ptolemy 3 as an alternate way to bring supplies in the palace.

Id: [0x000D35DC]
Although it is not used for that purpose anymore, it was kept to be used as a quick escape route in case our family got trapped inside the walls.

Id: [0x000D35DD]
Is the structure still stable?

Id: [0x000D35DE]
Just keep moving and we will be fine.

Id: [0x000D35DF]
Was this really the only way to get me through?

Id: [0x000D35E0]
Quiet, my queen...

Id: [0x000D35E1]
Those really need to be cleaned... 

Id: [0x000D35E2]
Please don't drop me.

Id: [0x000D35E7]
Check the god's enclosure. I'll speak to the priestesses.

Id: [0x000D35E8]
Of course, give me the dungheap job.

Id: [0x000D35EB]
Father, this is Bayek. He once raced with Claridas.

Id: [0x000D35EC]
Grew up with Claridas? Let's see you drive, Barek. Nikias, keep close. Maybe you'll learn something.

Id: [0x000D35F0]
When was the last time you raced Claridas?

Id: [0x000D35F1]
A long while. I barely know the name.

Id: [0x000D35F7]
Quite the estate.

Id: [0x000D35F8]
Yes, we've been lucky. Father breeds horses, and his horses have often won in the games. I told him about meeting you.

Id: [0x000D35F9]
You told him what?

Id: [0x000D35FA]
Not much. That you are a rider. That you know Claridas well.

Id: [0x000D3697]
Ready?

Id: [0x000D3698]
Yes. Let's go.

Id: [0x000D391D]
Sand.

Id: [0x000D391E]
They've mixed it with the natron.

Id: [0x000D3975]
May Serapis lead Ptolemy to wisdom! May peace and justice reign.

Id: [0x000D3977]
In this city, peace and justice are costly. Only the wealthy chew on that meat.

Id: [0x000D3993]
It's quiet today.

Id: [0x000D3994]
Did you not know? Eudoros is at the baths.

Id: [0x000D3995]
Ah! Of course. The palace is much more pleasant without Eudoros and his constant bitching.

Id: [0x000D39DA]
Show him what happens when you try to cheat a woman.

Id: [0x000D39DB]
Please, help me!

Id: [0x000D39DC]
Forget him! He's just an idiot Greek. They have taken enough from our land!

Id: [0x000D39DD]
Praise and thanks! You saved my life… and my purse.

Id: [0x000D39DE]
In future, be careful when drinking with strangers.

Id: [0x000D39E6]
No, they think themselves lions, but they are no more than carrion eaters. And now they will feed the scavengers!

Id: [0x000D39E7]
Bayek! Did you see the sandstorm?

Id: [0x000D3A03]
Will he be fine, father?

Id: [0x000D3A04]
I will see he gets the rest he needs.

Id: [0x000D3A08]
I'm glad you made it safely, Maharet.

Id: [0x000D3A15]
There now, good boy.

Id: [0x000D3A1A]
May the gods smile upon you.

Id: [0x000D3A1B]
Stripped of armor, weapons, and coin. Where to begin?

Id: [0x000D3A31]
They should have stayed in the shadows.

Id: [0x000D3A69]
This is a test of the Dialogue system, with Camera swtiches

Id: [0x000D3A6A]
The Camera will switch depending on who is speaking

Id: [0x000D3A6B]
This tests the Camera on Ground, specifically

Id: [0x000D3A6C]
With the Time of Day set during the Day

Id: [0x000D3A6D]
With only 2 Characters present

Id: [0x000D3A79]
Do you have enough to barter with me?

Id: [0x000D3A8D]
Not yet.

Id: [0x000D3A91]
I'll be waiting.

Id: [0x000D3AA0]
This must be Mered's horse. He neglected to tell me his "customers" were bandits.

Id: [0x000D3AD7]
You failed to mention it was in the possession of bandits.

Id: [0x000D3AE2]
Khaliset takes shelter in a cave in the hills behind Menkaure.

Id: [0x000D3AE5]
What are you waiting for? You want to find the Hyena, don't you?

Id: [0x000D3AF1]
Someone has made this place their home.

Id: [0x000D3AFB]
Mered was telling the truth.

Id: [0x000D3B4F]
Hello! You said you could help with my vision

Id: [0x000D3B50]
I did, but I need more time to understand it myself

Id: [0x000D3B51]
I do have a task for you while I consult the bones, I think you have the gift of Far sight.

Id: [0x000D3B52]
Let's test that skill, I have 3 clients of mine, their life hangs in your hands. Go help them.

Id: [0x000D3C77]
This is a test of the Dialogue system, with Camera switches

Id: [0x000D3C78]
The Camera will switch depending on who is speaking

Id: [0x000D3C79]
This tests the Camera on Ground, specifically

Id: [0x000D3C7A]
With the Time of Day set during the Night

Id: [0x000D3C7B]
With only 2 Characters present

Id: [0x000D4F44]
Khufu's tomb. She has detailed every crevice.

Id: [0x000D542A]
It is not like you to waver before a fight, Bayek!

Id: [0x000D542C]
If we delay too long, the High Priest will have harsh words for us.

Id: [0x000D542E]
Come, the crowd awaits!

Id: [0x000D543E]
But…

Id: [0x000D547A]
Ah! Aya's place.

Id: [0x000D547B]
There is the man who tried to kill my wife. He should have known better.

Id: [0x000D54A2]
Siwa was an intrusion.

Id: [0x000D54A3]
Who dares to enter here, where silence has befallen her?

Id: [0x000D54A4]
A Medjay who has treaded many dunes to find you. Hide if you must, Hyena, but this tomb will not protect you.

Id: [0x000D54A5]
I demand that you stop here. Turn back now, and I will excuse this intrusion.

Id: [0x000D54BC]
I am just looking. You know about a man named Zervos?

Id: [0x000D54BD]
Why are you asking about him?

Id: [0x000D54BE]
I've heard he's missing. In hiding? Perhaps dead?

Id: [0x000D54BF]
What would you do if Sefetu put a price on your head?

Id: [0x000D54D3]
[YAWN] You look like a strapping sort. Looking to improve your armor?

Id: [0x000D54D4]
Long night?

Id: [0x000D54D5]
The harbormaster? Of course. Zervos is… uh… away.

Id: [0x000D54D8]
Away?

Id: [0x000D54D9]
Yes. Uh, he's gone to Letopolis. Attracted by the promise of a new life.

Id: [0x000D54DA]
Then he's not dead.

Id: [0x000D54DB]
Good day for business?

Id: [0x000D54DC]
Not half bad! What are you looking for today?

Id: [0x000D54DD]
For Zervos, the harbor master. Do you know where to find him?

Id: [0x000D54DE]
You are looking for who? Why? I don't know him! I heard he was dead! Why are you bothering about him? He was a good man!

Id: [0x000D54DF]
A good man? So you do know him.

Id: [0x000D54E0]
I don't! I just heard others say it. Leave me be!

Id: [0x000D54E1]
Everyone has a different story about Zervos. I wonder if one of them knows more than they are telling me.

Id: [0x000D5950]
You are always welcome in Yamu, whenever your journeys bring you to our nome.

Id: [0x000D599E]
Once she knew the symbols she carved them here. And ended the ritual with one final prayer over the sarcophagus.

Id: [0x000D599F]
Khaliset must be trying to bring someone back to life. But just who is buried down here?

Id: [0x000D59A3]
Welcome, welcome to Letopolis! I never forget a face and I have not seen yours before.

Id: [0x000D59A4]
I'm looking for Tahar-

Id: [0x000D59A5]
You just don't know it yet! We give every new arrival a house. Only dig it out, and help with the public works. A fresh start!

Id: [0x000D59A7]
This is a test of the Dialogue system

Id: [0x000D59A8]
This time, horses are involved in the test

Id: [0x000D59A9]
The Time of Day is set to noon

Id: [0x000D59AA]
The camera still switches based on requests

Id: [0x000D59AB]
Which leads to unique conversations

Id: [0x000D59C3]
Come! Father said you'd join us for dinner!

Id: [0x000D59C5]
I will look into this curse.

Id: [0x000D5F8E]
Soon I will walk the outer darkness with the Hidden One, leading me into the Field of Reeds…

Id: [0x000D6027]
Hiyah!

Id: [0x000D603C]
Oh gods, smile upon my work so that my name might remain enduring in this temple for ever and ever.

Id: [0x000D603D]
O mother Nut, watch over me, so that I may be placed among the imperishable stars and may never die.

Id: [0x000D603E]
Good? Evil? Those are phantasms of the desert.

Id: [0x000D6072]
Hail to you, Osiris! Your limbs are lasting, you do not know corruption.

Id: [0x000D6073]
There are no worms with you, you are not repugnant.

Id: [0x000D6074]
Here is the tomb of Osiris, motionless, motionless like Osiris; motionless his limbs like Osiris.

Id: [0x000D6075]
Let them not remain motionless, let them not corrupt.

Id: [0x000D6076]
Why are you so angry?

Id: [0x000D6077]
Oh, gods… I think I am going to… [burps loudly]

Id: [0x000D6078]
Stay where you are!

Id: [0x000D6079]
Klaudios?

Id: [0x000D607A]
Hey, you! … Hello?

Id: [0x000D6082]
Soldiers! They must be looking for Iras.

Id: [0x000D6083]
Best lay low… and hope she does, too.

Id: [0x000D6084]
You came back.

Id: [0x000D6085]
You will be bothered no longer.

Id: [0x000D6086]
You've killed Sophronios?

Id: [0x000D6087]
Yes.

Id: [0x000D6088]
I wish it had been I who slit his throat.

Id: [0x000D6089]
... My apologies. Truly, I am grateful for your help.

Id: [0x000D608A]
My labor now is to rebuild my farm.

Id: [0x000D60CB]
Senu?..... SENUUU!!!

Id: [0x000D60CC]
Now where did he go off to? 

Id: [0x000D60CD]
This is a test of the Dialogue System

Id: [0x000D60CE]
There are more than two Characters present

Id: [0x000D60CF]
The Camera will shift based upon the speaker and listener given

Id: [0x000D60D0]
The Camera position is determined through the Control Room

Id: [0x000D60D1]
All this leads to more dynamic scenes

Id: [0x000D60E3]
You needn't hide any longer. The documents are gone.

Id: [0x000D60E4]
Never thought I would want to hear that one of my ships sank.

Id: [0x000D60E5]
A small sacrifice.

Id: [0x000D60F1]
I'm not one of Sefetu's men. I'm searching for Zervos, on behalf of Harkuf.

Id: [0x000D60F2]
Good. I am Zervos, mighty harbormaster of Sais. Heh. Forced to hide on my own docks.

Id: [0x000D60F5]
Why is Sefetu after you?

Id: [0x000D60F6]
That dog. He is strangling the whole town!

Id: [0x000D60F7]
And he figured it out.

Id: [0x000D60F8]
His men raided my business and my house, but I hid my records on my felucca. If they haven't found my boat yet, they soon will.

Id: [0x000D6101]
Is this the language of the gods?

Id: [0x000D610E]
Offerings to Osiris. Protector of the dead.

Id: [0x000D611B]
They move not, they stir not: be it done for them as for Osiris. I am Osiris.

Id: [0x000D63FE]
Another message. What does it mean?

Id: [0x000D6656]
Departed, forgive my violation of your rest. Grant that I may pass by you.

Id: [0x000D6659]
[Screams]

Id: [0x000D665A]
[Screams]

Id: [0x000D665B]
You there! Help me!

Id: [0x000D665C]
Please, I beg you! Else these beasts will eat me alive!

Id: [0x000D665D]
Away with you! I'm sure I taste terrible!

Id: [0x000D666F]
Give my men a hand. They'll know exactly what to look for. It'll be easy.

Id: [0x000D6670]
Delivery upon payment.

Id: [0x000D6678]
Blasted beasts! I'll put an end to you!

Id: [0x000D6684]
We spent weeks in this long green nightmare, capturing animals for gladiators to slaughter.

Id: [0x000D6697]
As I dug out the main room, I f-f-found ominous writings on the wall.

Id: [0x000D6698]
These are old. But incomplete. Too much is missing.

Id: [0x000D6699]
Erased by time and sand. Do you...d-do you think it's a curse?

Id: [0x000D669B]
I will ask around town.

Id: [0x000D669D]
That's the whole message.

Id: [0x000D66A0]
Peace be on you! May Osiris shield your loved one's journey.

Id: [0x000D66A1]
I do not need your services. I'm here to inspect the temple.

Id: [0x000D66A3]
You are no priest. In whose name do you dare profane our grounds?

Id: [0x000D66A4]
In the High Priest's name. Prove this by messenger if you wish.

Id: [0x000D66A6]
...Ah, yes. Poor Pasherenptah. The curse weighs heavy on us all.

Id: [0x000D66B0]
Blood-fevered followers of Sekhmet, the Lady of Slaughter. They wish nothing more than chaos and ruin.

Id: [0x000D66B2]
These men...they were wab priests. Were they killed, or did they choose this fate for themselves?

Id: [0x000D66C8]
These are offerings to the bull. They seem sound.

Id: [0x000D66C9]
Pasherenptah would use a taster for the god's water.

Id: [0x000D66EB]
I'll kill you. How about that? I'm in no mood for compromise today.

Id: [0x000D66EC]
We passed Neapolis in the crack of morning. With strong winds, you'll be standing in Rome's Forum in two days' time.

Id: [0x000D66EE]
So begins a new day.

Id: [0x000D66EF]
It's over between you and Bayek, eh? I can feel... no decision is easy. But you are a chosen one. And now you're free. Like me.

Id: [0x000D66FC]
Forward men! Litter the sea with their shattered hulls!

Id: [0x000D66FD]
Strike oars! Al-la-la-la-la!

Id: [0x000D66FE]
Ah, the songs they will sing about us when this day is out!

Id: [0x000D66FF]
If that happens, Phoxidas, I will wear seaweed like a siren and sing them myself.

Id: [0x000D6700]
Another down!

Id: [0x000D6701]
There is only one more left for the abyss!

Id: [0x000D6703]
Men! Don't fear this beast. She's a great and girthy whale, but we'll dance around her bulk like minnows in a pond!

Id: [0x000D6704]
You weren't a poet in your youth, were you Phoxidas?

Id: [0x000D6705]
Oho! I should have been, I think! A philosopher too. Ah, what we should have been? A million things fair Aya!

Id: [0x000D6706]
You must write your memoirs one day!

Id: [0x000D6707]
I may just do! And if you'll promise to sneak one copy into the Library, our legend will live on!

Id: [0x000D670C]
They set fireships upon us!

Id: [0x000D670D]
Our fleet is too tightly formed! They'll hit us!

Id: [0x000D670E]
We are overwhelmed! These hellships are too many!

Id: [0x000D670F]
We must sink them before they reach us!

Id: [0x000D6710]
They'll doom us if they strike us! Take them down!

Id: [0x000D6711]
Poseidon help us, it's an armada!

Id: [0x000D6712]
Do we have the firepower to deal with this?

Id: [0x000D6713]
I can't see how! With our fleet dispersed and our allies gone, we're undone!

Id: [0x000D6714]
Man up, you old salt-lick! Save your bloody ship!

Id: [0x000D671E]
Another fleet, there!

Id: [0x000D671F]
Blast! Jove's pissing on our heads from the peak of Olympus!

Id: [0x000D6720]
No, no! It's Brutus and Cassius! Look!

Id: [0x000D6723]
Let it rain! Down you demons! Into the sea!

Id: [0x000D6751]
His house is to the south near the ruined temple of Hathor, if you wish to speak to her.

Id: [0x000D6752]
There is a Seer with whom my wife has a strange fascination. She must have gone to consult him.

Id: [0x000D6753]
Invoke my name, should any person interfere with you.

Id: [0x000D745C]
This is a test of the Dialogue System

Id: [0x000D745D]
Indoors are the main focus for this particular test

Id: [0x000D745E]
The camera switches depending on the line being spoken

Id: [0x000D745F]
The Time of Day has also been set to night time

Id: [0x000D7460]
This should test the limits of the system indoors

Id: [0x000D75E2]
The Scarab preys upon the weak. He is no threat to me.

Id: [0x000D7619]
Is that him?

Id: [0x000D761A]
It could not be, could it? Oh, gods! It is!

Id: [0x000D761B]
Quiet, he'll hear you! Don't look at him.

Id: [0x000D763D]
Nek! You stinking warthog! Give me that Book!

Id: [0x000D763E]
Thought you could steal from me?

Id: [0x000D763F]
Is it stealing if you rob a thief?

Id: [0x000D7640]
I took it for my father!

Id: [0x000D7641]
Don't try to get clever with me!

Id: [0x000D7642]
Coward! Neket iadet!

Id: [0x000D7643]
I will have your head next time!

Id: [0x000D7652]
Ah, we were told to expect you. You may enter, so long as you do not disturb the rites.

Id: [0x000D7710]
Oh, the gods shame me, neb. The tanner is my husband. He carries that stench home whenever he returns from camp.

Id: [0x000D7711]
Hmm. I will consider it. Where would I find him?

Id: [0x000D7712]
His hunting camp is north and west of Sau.

Id: [0x000D7714]
All that you asked for.

Id: [0x000D7715]
Ah yes! Good, good! And in fine condition. They will do nicely. Your pay.

Id: [0x000D7718]
The amphitheater hunts.

Id: [0x000D7719]
In Cyrene I once saw a hundred lions killed to honor the gods.

Id: [0x000D771A]
I will no longer risk my life to capture a beast, just so some politician can win over the voters' hearts.

Id: [0x000D7725]
Tahira? What are you…?

Id: [0x000D7726]
It's nice to see you, too, Bayek. You look better.

Id: [0x000D7727]
You knew I was in the region?

Id: [0x000D7728]
I hoped. You leave a wake when you pass. Even I have heard stories of "Bayek of Siwa."

Id: [0x000D7729]
Why are you so far out here?

Id: [0x000D772A]
I'm defending this valley from becoming a Roman slaughterhouse. They capture our beasts, and they slaughter them in Rome before their gods.

Id: [0x000D772B]
Hmm. I've heard the stories.

Id: [0x000D772C]
I cannot stand against them alone. I prayed to Sobek, and he delivered… you. Come!

Id: [0x000D772D]
Tahira, wait…! Hey!

Id: [0x000D772E]
How old are the bodies of the dead when you get them?

Id: [0x000D772F]
A few days along.

Id: [0x000D773A]
Your face-- your face is that of a hound, whose nostril… sniffs at the covert to which my feet convey me.

Id: [0x000D773B]
"I know the deep waters" is my name.

Id: [0x000D7748]
Last night, my dear husband Klaudios took a boat out to see the ruins across the lake. He has not returned!

Id: [0x000D774A]
Your son is very proud of your work. He misses you.

Id: [0x000D7782]
I… did you… [Crocodiloi](Crocodiles) can talk! Always something new from Africa.

Id: [0x000D7797]
Oh, right! Then I woke up here, with those [crocodiloi](crocodiles) all around.

Id: [0x000D7798]
Tell me, can they really speak?

Id: [0x000D7799]
Egypt is a land full of magic and ancient mystery.

Id: [0x000D779A]
Amazing! My friends in the city will never believe it.

Id: [0x000D77A5]
Walk and talk with Apollodorus and Aya to the meeting with Cleo inside the villa.

Id: [0x000D77A6]
Oh Aya ! You've arrived.

Id: [0x000D77A7]
Hi Apollodorus. Hi Bayek. How are you ?

Id: [0x000D77A8]
Apollodorus taught me about all the rules concerning the meeting with Cleopatra. 

Id: [0x000D77A9]
It was necesary Bayek. Let's go see the Queen. 

Id: [0x000D77DC]
Freedom!

Id: [0x000D77DE]
Oh, that is right -- you are a Medjay. No! Not a criminal. I'm an opportunist!

Id: [0x000D77F0]
Okay, calm down. Rashidi has it. Who is this?

Id: [0x000D77F1]
Hah! Luck is always on your side, isn't it, Oba?

Id: [0x000D7800]
You lost the ring!?

Id: [0x000D7801]
You lost the ring!?

Id: [0x000D7803]
You lost the ring!?

Id: [0x000D7811]
Lying on what? What happened?

Id: [0x000D7812]
My notes. I'm a geographer -- Corteseos. Nice to meet you.

Id: [0x000D7814]
You too... I should have known better than to travel the desert on my own.

Id: [0x000D7815]
We're lucky enough to be alive. What do you remember?

Id: [0x000D781F]
That must be the horse the thieves used to escape. Through here.

Id: [0x000D7824]
It is odd for a child to be playing here, no?

Id: [0x000D782E]
This should cover what these bandits took from me.

Id: [0x000D782F]
Anta?

Id: [0x000D7830]
Anta!

Id: [0x000D7831]
Anta!

Id: [0x000D7832]
I told you to stay out of sight.

Id: [0x000D7833]
I know, but this was our fault and we thought you could use some help. The horseman is much, much bigger than you.

Id: [0x000D7834]
I have seen him in the ruins around Khufu's pyramid!

Id: [0x000D7835]
I will take care of this Horseman. You should leave.

Id: [0x000D7837]
Now!

Id: [0x000D783A]
Yes, to the house of Nef, with all the other children.

Id: [0x000D783B]
What luck! Come along, then!

Id: [0x000D7845]
Please, my husband is in danger. I need your help!

Id: [0x000D7847]
Will not you accompany me? Sekhmet favors the generous!

Id: [0x000D7849]
Give me your aid! I order you!

Id: [0x000D784B]
I have not seen my husband since yesterday. Help me find him!

Id: [0x000D7858]
My husband will die if you refuse to search for him!

Id: [0x000D785D]
They are closing the doors, we aren't going to make it

Id: [0x000D785E]
Take a right! RIGHT!

Id: [0x000D7878]
You and Nefertari are old friends?

Id: [0x000D7879]
Something like that. She saved my life after I killed Rudjek.

Id: [0x000D787A]
You are the one that killed Rudjek, eh? I cannot believe it -- by the gods! The brazier!

Id: [0x000D7883]
…shall smite the Goddess and condemn Yamu to a hundred seasons of darkness!

Id: [0x000DED8C]
Where are you taking me?

Id: [0x000DED8D]
To make amends with Anubis.

Id: [0x000DED8E]
Amends? I do not know what you're talking about.

Id: [0x000DED8F]
[chuckle] Hmph! Of course. How could you? You left the moment you woke.

Id: [0x000DED90]
You know all the natron for Egypt is collected here. We send it mostly to Memphis, to cover the bodies of the dead.

Id: [0x000DEDC8]
Strike oars!

Id: [0x000DEDC9]
Steady now. Rocks and rubble ahead.

Id: [0x000DEDCA]
Let's not be thrown into the sea. That's no death for such a hero as me!

Id: [0x000DEDCB]
A real hero could swim to save himself. I see them. I'll not be sucked through a scupper for nothing.

Id: [0x000DEDCC]
Sails on the horizon, there! Those colors are not from Rome. What mess has this poxy Queen dragged us into?

Id: [0x000DEDCD]
Ptolemy's ships. Sent by the Order of Ancients, no doubt.

Id: [0x000DEDCE]
Poseidon's piss! The air is already choked with smoke.

Id: [0x000DEDCF]
The seas will steam near the volcano. We should keep our distance if we don't want to burn.

Id: [0x000DEDD4]
Hah! That's the last of them down!

Id: [0x000DEDD5]
Yet still no sign of your faithless Roman.

Id: [0x000DEDD6]
Be careful with your jibes, captain. Pompey is a needed ally, and no mean general. We didn't sail all this way just to offend him with insults.

Id: [0x000DEDD7]
There, I see him! Pompey sails north.

Id: [0x000DEDD8]
Don't rush! There may be patrols ahead.

Id: [0x000DEDD9]
Hades' shit woman, of course not! But I am not keen to die protecting a Roman, especially one who can afford his own protection. You know you really should join this trireme. You'd fit right in.

Id: [0x000DEDDA]
Makes me sick to hear it. Wasn't it Cleopatra's father who did the same? Squandered Egypt's wealth on fashion, fornication, and Pompey's annual fee?

Id: [0x000DEDDB]
And you want us to trust his daughter?

Id: [0x000DEDDC]
The Queen is not her father. All she does, she does for Egypt's sake.

Id: [0x000DEDDD]
As well as her own. Here we are, bringing Pompey more of Egypt's wealth. At her bidding.

Id: [0x000DEDDE]
Why am I wasting words on politics? Death to all leaders, tyrants the lot of them. There! Just as I said! Ptolemy's Ships, port side! Seems this Roman of yours needs our protection after all! Alalalaa!

Id: [0x000DEDDF]
They fire on Pompey. Quickly! To his aid! Rain our arrows of Ra upon them!

Id: [0x000DEDE0]
Firebombs ready! Call for them when we pull near!

Id: [0x000DEDE1]
Pompey is taking heavy fire! We must stop them!

Id: [0x000DEDE2]
Keep at the poxy bastards! We'll break them, or take them down with us!

Id: [0x000DEDE3]
One more remains! That was brave work. There might be more to you than royal courtesies.

Id: [0x000DEDE4]
They're going down!

Id: [0x000DEDE5]
And that's the game! Well fought. Now let's find this metrokoites. I've never met a Roman General face to face before.

Id: [0x000DEEF3]
[BIRD CALL]

Id: [0x000DEEFD]
The entrance is barred.

Id: [0x000DF84D]
The families don't bring them right away so that we aren't tempted to defile them. Hehe.

Id: [0x000DF851]
I can see why they chose you to welcome the bereaved.

Id: [0x000DF881]
This is just how we get rid of the brain -- a useless organ!

Id: [0x000DF888]
You seem to enjoy this.

Id: [0x000DF889]
The dead are good company. They do not complain, and if they stare, you can always look away.

Id: [0x000DF898]
I wash the bodies of the dead. It's a job -- been doing it for ten years now.

Id: [0x000DF89A]
If you want to know more, read Herodotus instead of pestering me.

Id: [0x000DF89B]
The Father of Lies? I hear he's overrated.

Id: [0x000DF8A0]
Not yet.

Id: [0x000DF8B3]
If you want to talk natron, man out back is the expert.

Id: [0x000DF8B8]
Right, about time you got here. Memphis has been stinking of rot for months!

Id: [0x000DF8BB]
I suspect a problem with the natron. Where does it come from?

Id: [0x000DF8BF]
Not far from here. Guarded by good men near the canal. Watch out for crocodiles.

Id: [0x000DF96D]
And what are you looking out for, hmmm?

Id: [0x000DF96E]
I expected your master to have come searching for you by now.

Id: [0x000DFE72]
Only the guilty aim to disgrace the innocent.

Id: [0x000DFE73]
Oh! May the gods be kind!

Id: [0x000DFE74]
Salt is cheap. There must be more than gold to your crime.

Id: [0x000DFE75]
Gold had nothing to do with it.

Id: [0x000DFE76]
I brought foulness on the city only to protect her, I swear it! Please...

Id: [0x000DFE78]
Here, I kept it... Take it.

Id: [0x000DFE7D]
Briefly. It was no longer home.

Id: [0x000DFF49]
Old ruins, old gods.

Id: [0x000DFF4A]
Perhaps, but that doesn't mean it isn't without power. Shh. Watch.

Id: [0x000DFF4B]
Sobek's child.

Id: [0x000DFF50]
I'll send its writer to the Devourer.

Id: [0x000DFF7A]
Dymnos? I'm looking for Ruia.

Id: [0x000DFF7B]
Why would I know where that peasant is?

Id: [0x000DFF7C]
Perhaps because she has your badge.

Id: [0x000DFF80]
Why did you do it?

Id: [0x000DFF81]
Truth, I didn't mean to kill her. Only teach her a lesson for her insolence. She refused to read a letter for me.

Id: [0x000DFF82]
You must confess to Pelias.

Id: [0x000DFF83]
Was it Dymnos?

Id: [0x000DFF85]
Yes. He killed Ruia out of base cruelty. And he died because he thought I was also less than a person.

Id: [0x000DFF86]
What a senseless tragedy. She was a smart girl, with a good heart.

Id: [0x000DFFB3]
Lot of blood. Where's the body?

Id: [0x000DFFB4]
The railing broke... when someone went over it.

Id: [0x000DFFB6]
Such a mess.

Id: [0x000DFFB7]
Blood. Still fresh.

Id: [0x000DFFDD]
By Amun's horns!

Id: [0x000DFFDF]
Where is she? There's one missing! The Romans…

Id: [0x000DFFE5]
The blasted Romans have taken her to their camp. With your help, we can free her.

Id: [0x000DFFEC]
Hail in peace, Iras. All I want is to speak with you.

Id: [0x000DFFED]
The last man to say so murdered my family!

Id: [0x000DFFEE]
I've come to help you, Iras.

Id: [0x000DFFF2]
Ah, you are eager! That Is the Bayek I remember.

Id: [0x000DFFF7]
Well entrenched, I see.

Id: [0x000DFFF8]
I told you. The Romans' hunger is insatiable.

Id: [0x000DFFF9]
Sobek's daughter is inside.

Id: [0x000E0016]
By Amun... that is a crocodile.

Id: [0x000E0017]
Awesome, isn't she?<LF>

Id: [0x000E0020]
There, now, I'm not trying to harm you, Sobek knows.

Id: [0x000E0021]
Bayek, we must ensure that she reaches the shrine safely!

Id: [0x000E0024]
Or so I hope.

Id: [0x000E0028]
Bayek, watch your blade!

Id: [0x000E0033]
Do not call down Sobek's wrath!

Id: [0x000E0035]
You risk Sobek's teeth!

Id: [0x000E0037]
Thank you. With Sobek's favor, the Nile will flood again this year.

Id: [0x000E003B]
Fearsome, but beautiful in their ferocity.

Id: [0x000E003E]
You're welcome. Never thought I would think of crocodiles as romantic.

Id: [0x000E00D0]
Stop pissing off the foreman! Last thing we need is to get shipped off to the aqueduct!

Id: [0x000E00D1]
That place is the bowels of Hades. I saw cousin Houi yesterday he said the Romans will start making examples of people soon, cut a few throats.

Id: [0x000E00D3]
Romans! Ha! Sometimes I wonder if we made the right decision coming here… Faiyum was not so bad.

Id: [0x000E2CC3]
You're either very brave or very foolish, setting foot back here.

Id: [0x000E2CFA]
Ah! Bayek! I'm g-getting used to living with these symbols. Nebefer even came by for a meal. Did you find out anything?

Id: [0x000E2CFB]
I did. Though I'm not sure you are going to like it.

Id: [0x000E2CFC]
A curse! I knew it!

Id: [0x000E2CFD]
No, not exactly... Letopolis was an offering to Sekhmet, to protect the rest of the Nile.

Id: [0x000E2CFE]
We have offended the L-Lady of Slaughter!? No wonder the sands always blow! She wants to reclaim the city.

Id: [0x000E2CFF]
Are the officials blind, or mad? I can't stay here. Maybe Nebefer will come with me. What about you?

Id: [0x000E2D00]
My time here is but temporary.

Id: [0x000E2D01]
You were kind to me when others were not. Maybe we will see each other again in this world.

Id: [0x000E2EC2]
In an abandoned fort to the West, our point of retreat.

Id: [0x000E2EC3]
Retreat from what?

Id: [0x000E2EC4]
An attack on a nearby encampment. There were more soldiers than we thought. Lost a lot of good men.

Id: [0x000E2EC5]
Enough. That's why being close to the mine is so important. The healers work wonders.

Id: [0x000E2F3A]
May this amulet preserve his ka.

Id: [0x000E2F3C]
(coughing)

Id: [0x000E2F9C]
The line runs three stadia. According to our speculatores, Pothinus leads the charge.

Id: [0x000E2FAE]
Impudent man! Plato's dislike for poets had merit.

Id: [0x000E2FB4]
Do you truly need my help?

Id: [0x000E2FB6]
Quiet now. Hunters ahead.

Id: [0x000E2FB7]
Wait. I will help you track them all.

Id: [0x000E2FB8]
Now... fall upon them like Sobek's wrath!

Id: [0x000E2FC3]
Did I tell you of the poet Catullus?

Id: [0x000E2FC4]
I do not study overmuch to please and court you Caesar, nor do I care much to know if you be black or you be white!

Id: [0x000E2FC5]
Yes, as pretty as their words can be, they are roaches by the best measure. Annoying but easily handled.

Id: [0x000E2FC6]
And how did you handle this one?

Id: [0x000E2FC7]
I invited him to my house for dinner and drinks.

Id: [0x000E2FC9]
[Whistles!]

Id: [0x000E2FCC]
Quick work. Though I do not know what they do with the flamingos.

Id: [0x000E2FCE]
They eat the tongue. A Roman delicacy, boiled with dates… or so I've heard.

Id: [0x000E2FCF]
Sounds terrible.

Id: [0x000E2FDA]
How long have you been out this way?

Id: [0x000E2FDB]
Long enough for scar tissue to grow over some wounds. But some are still raw.

Id: [0x000E2FDF]
Wait. That is not a right sound.

Id: [0x000E2FE0]
Beat the bushes for the great sacred crocodiles! Glory and reward for whomever finds and catches them!

Id: [0x000E2FE1]
Those pus-filled scabs! They are defiling the shrine and trying to recapture Sobek's children!

Id: [0x000E2FE2]
See me at my home before you leave here, yes?

Id: [0x000E2FE3]
All right, I will.

Id: [0x000E2FF2]
I will tell Iras of this, if I see her again.

Id: [0x000E302A]
What, you think me helpless?

Id: [0x000E302B]
I am surprised to see a woman in your condition working so hard.

Id: [0x000E302C]
I am no delicate lily. [ONO grunt of pain]

Id: [0x000E302D]
Oh, are you in pain?

Id: [0x000E302E]
Bah, my little bean is just making herself known.

Id: [0x000E302F]
Allow me, nebet.

Id: [0x000E3033]
Good. Sobek's children can grow fat off Roman bones.

Id: [0x000E3035]
Oh, hush! Come, there are more of these Roman maggots to find.

Id: [0x000E303D]
Know thy enemies as thy kin.

Id: [0x000E303E]
And get them excessively drunk, when it needs be.

Id: [0x000E3064]
I think you might be Sobek's adopted daughter.

Id: [0x000E3066]
When we parted, you still had more names to find.

Id: [0x000E3067]
I found them.

Id: [0x000E3068]
And did they ease your night terrors?

Id: [0x000E3069]
No. Rather, they unlocked a whole new world of atrocities.

Id: [0x000E306B]
These Roman leeches prove their courage by caging hippos.

Id: [0x000E306D]
The Romans are fools. Rampaging hippos endanger every living thing.

Id: [0x000E3080]
That was god's work, Bayek. It was good to be at your side again.

Id: [0x000E3082]
My father always said to be wary of a smiling crocodile, but I will take Sobek's favor if he's offering.

Id: [0x000E30CF]
I thought I was supposed to be the somber one.

Id: [0x000E30D0]
And you. I will follow Sobek's children into the green. I hope you find what you are looking for.

Id: [0x000E310B]
My love! Are you well?

Id: [0x000E310D]
Dreams. Of our son.

Id: [0x000E312B]
But as the living goddess ascends the throne, the waters will rise again!

Id: [0x000E3134]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x000E3135]
No, I managed to squeeze in there just before it collapsed. I had no idea this was here. We were digging to reach the river...

Id: [0x000E3136]
That place was probably part of the old temple... Do you need help getting out of here?

Id: [0x000E3137]
I am fine. I am going to meet with my brothers and take a break.

Id: [0x000E3138]
What is this place?

Id: [0x000E3152]
A pigeon arrived not long ago. I sent Ruia to fetch it, but she is so unreliable. Probably batting her eyes at the master of arms.

Id: [0x000E315A]
An ill omen. How did that charcoal get spilled?

Id: [0x000E3178]
Ssh! Quiet, my sister.

Id: [0x000E31AE]
They followed us?

Id: [0x000E31AF]
No no...they're after the vault.

Id: [0x000E31B0]
They must have found a way to enter.

Id: [0x000E31B1]
No no no...we need to hurry.

Id: [0x000E31B2]
They won't leave Siwa alive.

Id: [0x000E31B3]
What's that?

Id: [0x000E321B]
You! You will answer to me!

Id: [0x000E324F]
Now, let havoc reign.

Id: [0x000E3256]
You are the only queen worthy of a throne!

Id: [0x000E336A]
Sennefer? Is it you?

Id: [0x000E336B]
Bayek, you sour-faced Siwan! Hah, hah. I-- I'm Claridas now. What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000E3370]
Where are you taking me, Sennefer?

Id: [0x000E3371]
Please! Claridas! I have not been Sennefer in years.

Id: [0x000E3372]
Why did you change your name?

Id: [0x000E3373]
To succeed in the Hippodrome, one must be welcomed by the Greek houses. So a Greek name.

Id: [0x000E3374]
Siwa was nothing to me. The Greeks may look down on us... but screw them! I eat and drink well on what I win!

Id: [0x000E3379]
Our gods never did anything for me!

Id: [0x000E3387]
Good day, Sir

Id: [0x000E3388]
Hello there, Bayek

Id: [0x000E3389]
You're a big one, aren't you!?

Id: [0x000E338A]
Ah Bayek! Hello!

Id: [0x000E338C]
You always looked down on me in Siwa. Thought you were better.

Id: [0x000E338D]
You're drunk. And an ass.

Id: [0x000E338E]
You have no idea what I gave up.

Id: [0x000E3408]
Through me, Memphis shines as rubies set in gold! Through me, Egypt triumphs!

Id: [0x000E340B]
The Apis bull persists in ailing?

Id: [0x000E363F]
Pssst! You there! Is that a Medjay badge? Over here!

Id: [0x000E3640]
Please, I am weak! Get me out of here! I will show you all of Giza's secrets. I know everything!

Id: [0x000E36A8]
Have I helped another criminal of Egypt?

Id: [0x000E36AF]
Shit. Well... She was just an Egyptian dog. No matter.

Id: [0x000E36BF]
What the funk are you doing here? This is no place for a young girl.

Id: [0x000E36C0]
I'm looking for treasure, old man. I know there's something out there.

Id: [0x000E36C1]
Uh! Old man?... And what makes you so sure you'll find anything?

Id: [0x000E36C2]
A sorcerer told me I'd find something if I climbed a pyramid.

Id: [0x000E36C3]
Maybe I can lend you a hand, I have an eagle and very good eyes.

Id: [0x000E36C4]
You're... one fast kid. How did you get down so fast?

Id: [0x000E36C5]
Like I said, I got my ways!

Id: [0x000E36C6]
At any rate, look what I found!

Id: [0x000E36C7]
Looks like a broken statuette of Sekhmet. Let me see.

Id: [0x000E36C8]
A storm is brewing, girl. We should get you back to safety.

Id: [0x000E36C9]
Gimme that back! We can head back to the market so I can show it to Baba Mustafa.

Id: [0x000E36CA]
Let's make it snappy then. Lead the way.

Id: [0x000E384E]
Two months, ever since the new Bull was chosen.

Id: [0x000E3859]
I am a servant of the Queen, who wishes very much to see Apis thrive.

Id: [0x000E3875]
Hathor give you strength.

Id: [0x000E38FA]
You should join us. We could use a strong warrior like yourself.

Id: [0x000E38FB]
Ah ha! That is my palace -- up ahead!

Id: [0x000E3907]
Yes, Nebet.

Id: [0x000E390F]
Ox race drunk

Id: [0x000E3910]
No choice, the crowd called the leap of faith. Let's go !

Id: [0x000E3911]
Shoot beer jars of your friends !

Id: [0x000E3912]
BAYEK : What happened last night ?...

Id: [0x000E391C]
This town is wild...are there beer halls, I could use a break. Do you get Harkuf's brew?

Id: [0x000E393C]
Can you tell me of your daily habits?

Id: [0x000E393D]
Every day is the same. We wake for morning prayers and then we feed the god.

Id: [0x000E393E]
We bless his grain…

Id: [0x000E393F]
A man pours out his water and cleans away his filth--

Id: [0x000E3942]
Why… yes! The, um, farmer…

Id: [0x000E3945]
Why did you even come out here in the first place?

Id: [0x000E3946]
Baba Mustafa told me I'd find something here.

Id: [0x000E3947]
He's a sorcerer that tells us stories of treasure coves and magical beasts and daring adventurers.

Id: [0x000E3948]
Aren't you a little young to venture in the wilderness like that?

Id: [0x000E3949]
Aren't you a little old to follow young girls around like that?

Id: [0x000E394A]
... Point taken.

Id: [0x000E3970]
We will get through this. Apollodorus is coming with our wine. All is not lost, Cleopatra is still the goddess.

Id: [0x000E397C]
Do any of his caretakers look suspicious?

Id: [0x000E397D]
I've always thought the farmer who brings his grain had an evil look.

Id: [0x000E397F]
Maybe you should question him.

Id: [0x000E3980]
Question him? No.

Id: [0x000E3981]
Wait, won't you speak with him first?

Id: [0x000E3982]
You know why Apis is sick.

Id: [0x000E3983]
Yes.

Id: [0x000E3986]
Suphia, are you ready to go?

Id: [0x000E39FA]
Hush, Tawe, shhh…

Id: [0x000E39FC]
This is a subtle way of poisoning an animal.

Id: [0x000E3AD9]
Our brother. Bandits ripped him away from us, as we walked in the market.

Id: [0x000E3ADC]
I'm so sorry! We had no choice. We never--

Id: [0x000E3B17]
These are the rooms of the Royal Scribe.

Id: [0x000E3C3C]
You brought back my taster!

Id: [0x000E3C3D]
This man has something to tell you.

Id: [0x000E3C8F]
Are you Panchrates?

Id: [0x000E3C90]
I am. Praise the gods for bringing a strong warrior to save me!

Id: [0x000E3D20]
Well done, Medjay. As promised, this is for you.

Id: [0x000E3D24]
Hey there. Wanna buy some [whisper].

Id: [0x000E3D25]
Greetings, Medjay.

Id: [0x000E3D26]
Bayek! Give a friend a hand, would you?

Id: [0x000E3D27]
Medjay! Help Reda out of a problem?

Id: [0x000E3D28]
These Phylakitai went too far this time! They took away an innocent villager. Which, if Reda thinks on it, is a thing a Medjay might look into.

Id: [0x000E3D29]
Use it well on your travels.

Id: [0x000E3D2A]
I have heard of a caravan being attacked, with the goods taken. If you get them back I'll help you out for a good deed done.

Id: [0x000E43D6]
You are injured. I will carry you home.

Id: [0x000E43D7]
I accept, with the greatest of joy.

Id: [0x000E4628]
Medjay. Some of those neket iadet bandits are raiding my customers!

Id: [0x000E462E]
Medjay!

Id: [0x000E4643]
Panchrates!

Id: [0x000E4644]
Are you hurt? Did they mistreat you?

Id: [0x000E464B]
Of course.

Id: [0x000E464C]
The man who ordered my abduction is a priest of Anubis at the Great Temple.

Id: [0x000E464F]
A priest in Pasherenptah's circle! How can I find him?

Id: [0x000E4650]
He wears a blue scarf, and has a terrible cough.

Id: [0x000E4652]
The Lizard. He is marked.

Id: [0x000E4665]
Baba Mustafa! Look what we found in the ruins!

Id: [0x000E4666]
Easy there, child! And who is this you bring along with you?

Id: [0x000E4667]
Some old weirdo I came across in the ruins...

Id: [0x000E4668]
The name's Bayek, actually. I helped this crazy kid find a treasure amongst the ruins.

Id: [0x000E4669]
I'm not crazy! I'm just weird!

Id: [0x000E466A]
Now let me see this treasure you both found.

Id: [0x000E466B]
Where did you find this?

Id: [0x000E466C]
In the temple ruins not too far away from here.

Id: [0x000E466D]
Hm! Well you may keep it for now.

Id: [0x000E466E]
Now let's head back to Memphis. Bayek, I could use a man like you to defend us on the road.

Id: [0x000E466F]
Bayek, that idol you found in the ruins is some bad juju.

Id: [0x000E4670]
What about it?

Id: [0x000E4671]
Bad people will be looking for it.

Id: [0x000E4672]
I need you to find the second half. It's in a bandits' lair.

Id: [0x000E4677]
Here's their lair. I'm positive they have the idol in there.

Id: [0x000E4678]
You be careful... Huh! Where's Bast? Little scamp must have run away again when we weren't looking.

Id: [0x000E4679]
This is bothersome... She probably headed back to Memphis. She hates how slow carts ride can be.

Id: [0x000E467A]
Once you have the idol, bring it to me in Memphis.

Id: [0x000E4681]
I will find this farmer, and I will deliver to him the justice of my blade.

Id: [0x000E4684]
No need. The denunciation of those sworn to the Twin Goddesses is enough.

Id: [0x000E4685]
He has sinned against the god. He must die.

Id: [0x000E4686]
My sister spoke too quickly. The man could be innocent.

Id: [0x000E4688]
Can the cause be found in his quarters?

Id: [0x000E4689]
Then we will await the return of my comrade before passing judgement.

Id: [0x000E468A]
No dice, couldn't find the idol. Maybe it's stashed outside?

Id: [0x000E468B]
Lemme try something.

Id: [0x000E468C]
*Grabs her idol and closes her eyes*

Id: [0x000E468D]
They're right here. They're leaving.

Id: [0x000E468E]
What? Who is?

Id: [0x000E468F]
*Opens her eyes* Bandits, they have the idol! They're leaving on horseback!

Id: [0x000E4690]
Get your buns out there Bayek!

Id: [0x000E4691]
But what about you...?

Id: [0x000E4692]
Don't mind me, I got my ways. GO GET THEM!

Id: [0x000E4693]
Baba Mustafa will want this back. He should be at the stand near the north gate

Id: [0x000E4694]
Hello Baba Mustafa. I... How did she get here?

Id: [0x000E4695]
How do you mean? Little Bast was here with me all along?

Id: [0x000E4696]
Anyways, I took care of those bandits, they shouldn't be troubling anyone anymore. Here's the idol.

Id: [0x000E4697]
Most acceptable! I'll take care of hiding those so they don't trouble anyone anymore.

Id: [0x000E4698]
[cries on 20s loop]

Id: [0x000E46BA]
The priest's sentiments would have only improved had he farted.

Id: [0x000E46C8]
Congratulations for your new chariot race !

Id: [0x000E46C9]
I take care of it delivered. You will have it when you get to the Hippodrome. 

Id: [0x000E46CA]
To access the Hippodrome, remember: you must have a wrace cart and being in a faction !

Id: [0x000E46EC]
And there's this…

Id: [0x000E46ED]
I should not refuse I suppose, if only to give my wife some relief! Take this as a token of good faith.

Id: [0x000E46F7]
I love coming here, the building alone is worth the trip. Look up at that expansive ceiling! Simply divine.

Id: [0x000E46F9]
Kyros chooses his horses badly. Have you seen his wife?<CR><LF>

Id: [0x000E470B]
Die and be done with it.

Id: [0x000E4716]
May the gods curse you! What cause have you to kill me?

Id: [0x000E4717]
It was you who murdered my son before my eyes.

Id: [0x000E4718]
That forsaken shit hole? I had nothing to do with that disaster!

Id: [0x000E4719]
It is too late for your lies. Anubis awaits.

Id: [0x000E471A]
It is worth the loss to slay the Snake at last.

Id: [0x000E471B]
The Snake?... The Snake will never die.

Id: [0x000E471E]
Son of Apep, the lord of the Duat awaits.

Id: [0x000E4722]
The Royal Scribe is dead!

Id: [0x000E4725]
Find the murderer!

Id: [0x000E4727]
No one leaves!

Id: [0x000E4731]
My dearest.

Id: [0x000E4739]
The Snake.

Id: [0x000E473E]
What if he was not the last?

Id: [0x000E473F]
Of course he was the last! They are all dead. Justice is done!

Id: [0x000E4741]
If there is any question, Apollodorus will know. He knows all.

Id: [0x000E4742]
And where will I find this man who knows so much.

Id: [0x000E476F]
Oba and Nebti said you might be in trouble. I think you'd all be better off giving up this life, hm?

Id: [0x000E4770]
We could, if we had the ring!

Id: [0x000E4771]
Wait, you mean you don't have it?

Id: [0x000E4772]
Turo punched me straight in the face and took off to the Hemon Tombs to trade it.

Id: [0x000E477B]
I have bad news.

Id: [0x000E477D]
Oh, tragic...and the ring?

Id: [0x000E477E]
Yes, quite unfortunate. And what of the ring?

Id: [0x000E4782]
This mess is their fault!

Id: [0x000E4783]
These men are ungrateful.

Id: [0x000E4784]
It is mine! I am the one who does all the work!

Id: [0x000E4788]
Thank you, sir. Now I'll be able to pay Sefetu's dogs off, this time at least.

Id: [0x000E4799]
Yes, neb! Now that he can get some rest, I think my boy will get back his strength. The gods praise you!

Id: [0x000E479B]
Tell me about these tax collectors.

Id: [0x000E479C]
They ride the roads all round Sais, sticking mostly to the outskirts.

Id: [0x000E479D]
Let me see if I can find them, and convince them to change their ways.

Id: [0x000E47AB]
Damn those two! I have to find the ring before they do!

Id: [0x000E47AC]
Gah! I will never give up!

Id: [0x000E47AE]
You work on your farm, and raising your boy.

Id: [0x000E47B1]
You are taking too much from the good people of Sais. You're killing them.

Id: [0x000E47B2]
It's what the Pharaoh wants, you mouthy prick.

Id: [0x000E47BD]
Do not think me rude, but I found these scented oils. I thought you could use them.

Id: [0x000E47C0]
I don't know about killing them, but we're sure happy to kill you!

Id: [0x000E47C4]
She's a handsome woman!

Id: [0x000E47C5]
Yes, well, good luck convincing her to let you into her bed while we ride around in the chariot her dead husband built.

Id: [0x000E47C7]
Now... Where am I going to find this thing...

Id: [0x000E47C8]
What thing, old guy? What are we looking for?

Id: [0x000E47C9]
Wha...! What are you doing here?? Didn't you go to Memphis?

Id: [0x000E47CA]
Not when there's adventures to be had! So what are we looking for anyway?

Id: [0x000E47CB]
"I" am looking for an idol that looks just like yours.

Id: [0x000E47CC]
This is a bandit hideout, isn't it? It must be in a hidden treasure cave. There's always a treasure cave!

Id: [0x000E47D3]
What fool would set up camp out here? I should have a look.

Id: [0x000E47EB]
I refuse! No more. They take too much!

Id: [0x000E47FD]
They will still take what they want, and then leave you to burn!

Id: [0x000E47FF]
My idiot brother has barricaded himself inside.

Id: [0x000E4800]
Who is that you're speaking to!? It's one of them, isn't it!?

Id: [0x000E4801]
No, you fool!

Id: [0x000E4802]
I am not an ostrich! Do I hear horses!? Is it them? You better run!

Id: [0x000E480C]
You cannot stay in there! You are only making it more difficult on yourself!

Id: [0x000E4820]
He fears Sefetu's men. But hiding his head in a bush solves nothing!

Id: [0x000E4821]
Only the worthy can buy these goods!

Id: [0x000E4822]
You want some [whisper]? All you have to do is pay for it, neb!

Id: [0x000E4823]
Only place in all of Egypt to get quality goods!

Id: [0x000E4824]
You need something, Reda has it!

Id: [0x000E4825]
You returned!

Id: [0x000E4826]
I always have something for you.

Id: [0x000E4827]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000E4828]
Ready to have your mind expanded, Medjay?

Id: [0x000E4834]
Thank you, Medjay! May Serapis favor you!

Id: [0x000E4835]
You did it? Ah, yes, of course I never doubted you. For you.

Id: [0x000E4836]
A gift for you from me and not the gods, though we already know Ra smiles upon you.

Id: [0x000E4837]
You never cease to impress Bayek.

Id: [0x000E4838]
Your payment, as promised.

Id: [0x000E4839]
A completed task requires a reward, does it not?

Id: [0x000E483A]
Who's leaving!? Are you leaving!? Don't leave me here alone!

Id: [0x000E483F]
Why did father ever leave the farm to you...

Id: [0x000E4855]
I heard that a nearby villager was taken by soldiers. It's an interesting thing someone ought to look into. Someone might even be paid well should he deal with these stupid guards.

Id: [0x000E4856]
One of my suppliers is in jail, Bayek. One of my suppliers. They did nothing wrong. Well, they may have taken back an unjust tax from a Phylakitai but that is simply righting a wrong. Look into it, Bayek. I will remember your help.

Id: [0x000E4857]
How long do you think a prisoner lasts in a cage in these parts? Would be a shame if someone else died because of these Phylakitai, Medjay. Someone like you could easily handle a few guards, no?

Id: [0x000E4858]
Heard a villager didn't pay a bribe locally. Got shoved in a cage. Would be a shame if someone freed him. The guards would be very angry.

Id: [0x000E486C]
Bandits around these parts are getting cocky, making it harder to get my wares sold. You would do Reda a favor by handling them.

Id: [0x000E486D]
If I told you that there is a reward to handle a group of bandits, would you be interested?

Id: [0x000E486E]
I heard there are bandits harassing people, likely with a reward already on their heads for dealing with them. I'd know, as I'm the one who put the reward out for them. Bandits are not good for business.

Id: [0x000E486F]
What do you think of addressing a bandit problem?

Id: [0x000E4878]
Bandits broke up a convoy and stole some of my goods. If you retrieve them, I will definitely make it worth your while, Medjay.

Id: [0x000E4879]
A stolen caravan is a loss to any merchant, but mostly for me. If you get it back, you will be very happy with your reward, Medjay.

Id: [0x000E487A]
Rumor has it that bandits have attacked a caravan recently. Think you can get the goods back?

Id: [0x000E487B]
Bandits bad, caravan good. Get Reda back his stuff, you get paid. Easy enough, Medjay.

Id: [0x000E4881]
Wake up! Wake up! Oh, what luck! You're all right!

Id: [0x000E4884]
Remember? I was clubbed in the head! I only recall the sound of a horse galloping away.

Id: [0x000E4885]
There might be tracks. Stay here.

Id: [0x000E4889]
Those notes are my life's work! Years and years of work. I am lost without them.

Id: [0x000E4895]
What will you do to the priest who took our brother?

Id: [0x000E4896]
We will relieve him of his duties.

Id: [0x000E4897]
Endure forever, warrior.

Id: [0x000E489D]
The harbor master? Ahh…

Id: [0x000E48A3]
Behold the Lord and his Flood!

Id: [0x000E48A5]
Hail in peace. I wish to--

Id: [0x000E48A6]
See, the Shoulder is-- the Shoulder is, uh, fastened upon his neck.

Id: [0x000E48A8]
Anubis is my bearer, for he who lulls me to rest is the god in Lion form.

Id: [0x000E48A9]
The god saves me!

Id: [0x000E48AA]
I am He who comes forth as one who breaks through the door.

Id: [0x000E48AC]
Finest metal work in Sais!

Id: [0x000E48AD]
Dead? Why would you think he was dead?

Id: [0x000E48B4]
Good day to you, neb! Any metal work I can do for you this day?

Id: [0x000E48D5]
What? Who is he? Is he one of Sefetu's curs?

Id: [0x000E48D6]
I do not know. I do not think so. He wears an old-fashioned badge. But he does look dangerous.

Id: [0x000E48E8]
There is a stranger in the market asking about you.

Id: [0x000E48FC]
How are you keeping?

Id: [0x000E48FD]
As best I can. I'm tired of hiding.

Id: [0x000E4904]
Curses will trouble you no more.

Id: [0x000E4912]
You needn't hide any longer. I secured your felucca. Your documents are safe.

Id: [0x000E4917]
May demons feast on Hetepi's ka.

Id: [0x000E4918]
And may those guilty of Khemu's death soon follow.

Id: [0x000E4DEF]
I was mapping this pyramid one moment, and the next I'm spitting up sand.

Id: [0x000E4E04]
No, ermh...I mean yes, alone.

Id: [0x000E4E08]
I'm looking for some stolen items -- looks like you could help me...

Id: [0x000E4E0D]
We hid it in Menkaure's pyramid! I'm sorry! We had to do it for Anta!

Id: [0x000E4E2E]
Anta!

Id: [0x000E4E36]
What's a child doing out here? It's dangerous.

Id: [0x000E4E39]
That boy is hiding something.

Id: [0x000E4E89]
Our son's shade will weep with joy when we clear the map of those figures.

Id: [0x000E4E8A]
So it shall be! Tonight we drink, celebrate, make love! Tomorrow -

Id: [0x000E4EA0]
Bayek. Before I can disclose all secrets, Cleopatra must meet and approve of you.

Id: [0x000E4EA3]
Speak only in reply. Yours is not to question, but to answer.

Id: [0x000E4EA4]
Speak clearly, in measured tones and above all, do not meet her gaze!

Id: [0x000E4F19]
Ah, Pasherenptah! Meet Aya and Bayek. They put an early end to Eudoros.

Id: [0x000E4F1D]
Eudoros was a member of the Order of Ancients, they are responsible for my exile. They tore me from my throne.

Id: [0x000E4F1F]
And why should I care about them?

Id: [0x000E4F20]
The Snake has many heads. Those heads make up the Order.

Id: [0x000E4F24]
The Snake is the man who killed my son.

Id: [0x000E4F25]
It is not so simple.

Id: [0x000E4F28]
What are they talking about?

Id: [0x000E4F29]
Across Egypt, mysterious forces work against us. For instance, here in the Nile delta -

Id: [0x000E4F37]
Make sure he leads you to that ring! We're supposed to share it, but I think he ran off to sell it himself.

Id: [0x000E4F46]
You've got quite the swing.

Id: [0x000E4F54]
Horseman?

Id: [0x000E4F5B]
They won't bother you anymore. So you can stop bludgeoning people over the head now.

Id: [0x000E4F5D]
Are these the thieves!?

Id: [0x000E4F5E]
Oh, easy, friend. There was a misunderstanding. Their hands were forced.

Id: [0x000E4F62]
I have not yet mapped out Memphis! It was supposed to be my next stop. Do you know the way?

Id: [0x000E4F63]
Oh, no. They know their way around.

Id: [0x000E4F72]
We do not know what your efforts are.

Id: [0x000E4FFB]
You were meant to kneel.

Id: [0x000E5004]
Yes, I am ready.

Id: [0x000E5008]
My child![heavy breathing]

Id: [0x000E500E]
Who is this man?

Id: [0x000E500F]
He is the Deliverer. Many years I have waited for him.

Id: [0x000E5010]
What?

Id: [0x000E5011]
Quick, help me dream my child away from death!

Id: [0x000E501A]
Sothis, reveal yourself here today, and answer me without falsehood.

Id: [0x000E501C]
Let your eyes be opened.

Id: [0x000E501E]
Let your eyes be opened.

Id: [0x000E5026]
[strangled gasp]

Id: [0x000E5028]
Devoid of moisture, come forth from the stream!

Id: [0x000E5031]
Sothis, let their eyes be opened!

Id: [0x000E5035]
They are returned, safe from him who would close their eyes in darkness.

Id: [0x000E5048]
What do you see?

Id: [0x000E504C]
Your enemy and hers are the same.

Id: [0x000E504E]
Refuse... the temple food.

Id: [0x000E5050]
Go and slay the poisoner, and lift Memphis out of evil.

Id: [0x000E5053]
Praise to he who will deliver us all.

Id: [0x000E505A]
If you wish to speak of your own true seeing, come to me in the fullness of the moment.

Id: [0x000E505B]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000E5065]
Let us proceed with the ritual.

Id: [0x000E5076]
There is a town called Antium I'd like to try. Lots of merchants sail in and out of there. Should be safe for you.

Id: [0x000E5077]
Heyo slackers! Form up with the rest! Today we sail together.

Id: [0x000E5078]
Hm. A Roman fleet up ahead. Do you see?

Id: [0x000E507F]
Don't drop your guard entirely. We should assume they're expecting us.

Id: [0x000E5080]
You sound thrilled about it.

Id: [0x000E5081]
We have been spotted!

Id: [0x000E5082]
Those flares will summon their navy!

Id: [0x000E5083]
Prepare yourselves!

Id: [0x000E5084]
Here they come!

Id: [0x000E509A]
I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x000E509B]
Go carefully. Sefetu's men watch the harbor like hawks!

Id: [0x000E509F]
I've been doing what I can. Helping people hide their imports and exports. What Sefetu does not see, he cannot tax.

Id: [0x000E50AA]
Nefertari… isn't it? A thousand blessings are long overdue.

Id: [0x000E50AB]
This way, Bayek -- and bring along your thousand blessings. You will need them.

Id: [0x000E50B6]
Tragic, indeed. Where is she now?

Id: [0x000E50B7]
You can find her on the abandoned date farm near the road, where her family died.

Id: [0x000E50B8]
I hope these tough times to do not kill her aura.

Id: [0x000E50C7]
I'll ignite the torches and end this curse, or omen… or whatever it is.

Id: [0x000E50C8]
You would do well to, if you ever hope to appease Anubis and gain my pardon.

Id: [0x000E50D8]
An attempt on your life? By your brother's phylakes?

Id: [0x000E50D9]
Hard to tell. A Gabiniani. One of Septimius' warriors.

Id: [0x000E50DA]
They form a militia two thousand strong. I had hoped to ally with them.

Id: [0x000E50EB]
Since Jeska was killed, Harkuf needs a trusted agent to shepherd people out from under Sefetu's watch.

Id: [0x000E50EC]
Dead? You and Harkuf are out of touch! Jeska's too tough to be held by Sefetu. She escaped the Firebrand!

Id: [0x000E50ED]
What? Where is she?

Id: [0x000E50EE]
Back on the river. She took a felucca loaded with supplies to the people she sheltered.

Id: [0x000E50FC]
Bayek!

Id: [0x000E50FE]
The so-called Queen. Your throne shall resemble a tomb.

Id: [0x000E5104]
Ahh... You smell of the sea.

Id: [0x000E5105]
The high seas have taken me for some time. But now I am yours.

Id: [0x000E5110]
Leave that alone!

Id: [0x000E5113]
There is the torch. It just needs some fire.

Id: [0x000E5117]
Hiyah! Away, you blasted river pigs!

Id: [0x000E5119]
If I had a spear, I would stick you right in the eye!

Id: [0x000E511F]
How do you know Harkuf?

Id: [0x000E5121]
I was sent to him by a man to whom I am pledged. I believe we are working towards the same end.

Id: [0x000E5124]
Sefetu's soldiers brought me to Fort Nikiou, where they burned and tortured me. But I spat in their faces.

Id: [0x000E513F]
Nefertari was not exaggerating. This one died trying to light the torch.

Id: [0x000E5143]
Well, Harkuf is a great man, though Sais is a region of self-proclaimed great men. But Harkuf has a good heart. He cares for his people and his city.

Id: [0x000E5145]
I have smuggled many families, like poor Wenis and her son, out of Sais to keep them safe. Those who have tried to refuse Sefetu, he has burned to death.

Id: [0x000E5146]
How did you survive?

Id: [0x000E514A]
Search for any last plunder these malakia may have hidden!

Id: [0x000E5159]
Anything you find, half goes to Sefetu, and half you keep!

Id: [0x000E515F]
Did you hear that?

Id: [0x000E5160]
Yes… [whistles]

Id: [0x000E5162]
Pentu! Oh, by the gods, you are still alive! I will not leave you here.

Id: [0x000E5166]
[GROAN]

Id: [0x000E5168]
[WEAK COUGH]

Id: [0x000E516D]
Hey, Old Man. Oh, are you injured?[Laughs]

Id: [0x000E516E]
My mind is a riot. All I have is that I am pushed further, one more attempt to snuff me out.

Id: [0x000E5177]
No, no, it can't be.... Where is Caesar?

Id: [0x000E518A]
Before we go inside, let us speak.

Id: [0x000E518B]
I prefer to spare my sisters the ugliest details of my story.

Id: [0x000E518D]
Ipi! Abana! Are you there?

Id: [0x000E518E]
By Serapis! Is it you, Jeska? We saw what happened. We thought you'd died!

Id: [0x000E518F]
Pentu survived. He needs help.

Id: [0x000E5190]
Of course! Bring him here.

Id: [0x000E5198]
Thank you for Pentu's life.

Id: [0x000E5199]
I did nothing that you would not have done. He owes his life to you. This is not the end of it, however.

Id: [0x000E51A7]
No. Those dogs still hunt for their prick master.

Id: [0x000E51A8]
I cannot bring your people back from Duat. But I will help you avenge your village.

Id: [0x000E51C1]
What news do you bring?

Id: [0x000E51CD]
You! You've signed your own death warrant, neb!

Id: [0x000E51CF]
Egyptian worm! You're meat!

Id: [0x000E51D7]
Here is when he crowned Ptolemy Lagos as his successor.

Id: [0x000E51D9]
So the rule of the Ptolemies began. And the Medjays ended. Medjays disappeared because of him.

Id: [0x000E51E7]
Beside the torches?

Id: [0x000E51E8]
Suphia has offered to go in my place, but only if you escort her.

Id: [0x000E51F7]
Bayek! It was Sefetu!

Id: [0x000E51F9]
They took Harkuf. I know what they will do. Torture him with red-hot tongs. Perhaps rip his tongue out.

Id: [0x000E51FB]
Neb! Please, come quickly! It is terrible!

Id: [0x000E51FF]
This stench! Vile as the Devourer's breath.

Id: [0x000E5202]
Bayek! You will need to find the key Sefetu wears around his neck! Hurry!

Id: [0x000E5204]
I have the key here.

Id: [0x000E5213]
You are a thorn in my ass. I will burn every inch of you and feed your ashes to the gods.

Id: [0x000E5227]
Let's see what news there is...

Id: [0x000E5229]
I'm dying.

Id: [0x000E522A]
I want to be buried in Memphis.

Id: [0x000E522B]
*Dead*

Id: [0x000E522C]
I'll bring your dead body to a ferry, guy.

Id: [0x000E5231]
Ferry guy, I'll pay you to transport this corpse to get mummified in Memphis.

Id: [0x000E5232]
Okay.

Id: [0x000E56DE]
This is no farm, but a major military encampment.

Id: [0x000E56EC]
These were no soldiers.

Id: [0x000E5709]
May Iset and Horus and Serapis and Anubis and...

Id: [0x000E570A]
Hurry, fool! Thank them later!

Id: [0x000E5711]
Thank you, friend! While scouting the Roman forces, I foolishly fell into their hands.

Id: [0x000E5712]
Can you make it back from here?

Id: [0x000E5715]
It's barbaric! They train elephants to battle with bloodlust, and force them to kill hapless prisoners to harden them!

Id: [0x000E5716]
Of course! I will find Apollodorus and tell him!

Id: [0x000E5718]
Drive these beasts away!

Id: [0x000E571D]
Please, friend! The lock is jammed, and I cannot free myself.

Id: [0x000E571E]
After the crash, I hid in here to stay safe. But I would hate to die in here…

Id: [0x000E5725]
Sounds wise.

Id: [0x000E5726]
I will seek my fortune in Herakleion. May the gods favor you!

Id: [0x000E5729]
Oh, decided to come back?

Id: [0x000E572B]
What's got into you, bird?

Id: [0x000E572C]
By Amun, if I have to chase you down because you saw a rabbit...

Id: [0x000E5740]
Find me near the Roman camp.

Id: [0x000E5742]
What are you waiting for? Smash the cage!

Id: [0x000E574A]
Here, Bayek. The gods still have need for us.

Id: [0x000E57FF]
I do not know how long he will continue to smile. Cities like Herakleion are a blight upon the land, driving the gods away from here.

Id: [0x000E5800]
You are right, my brother.

Id: [0x000E5801]
It was good to see you, Tahira. May all the gods watch over you.

Id: [0x000E5816]
Your brother sent me here. Where is Kawit?

Id: [0x000E582C]
Have you gone to see Suphia? She will be waiting for you by the northern entrance tonight.

Id: [0x000E5830]
I hear you are in some trouble. I owe a favor to Nefertari.

Id: [0x000E5831]
If it's as you say...Follow me, and stay close -- we've got quite a journey ahead.

Id: [0x000E5833]
Hop in, if you are coming with me.

Id: [0x000E5835]
Do you see something? Better hop in, if you want to come with me.

Id: [0x000E5C3B]
Where are you camped?

Id: [0x000E5C3C]
How many wounded?

Id: [0x000E5C41]
This is it. When we get inside, I will need your help to tend to the wounded while Suphia prepares the natron.

Id: [0x000E5C44]
I will set up. Bayek, follow Namrut. He will show you what to do.

Id: [0x000E5C45]
These men -- move them to the rear, by the kilns.

Id: [0x000E5C49]
[Groaning]

Id: [0x000E5C53]
These bloated lake cows! Help me drive them off!

Id: [0x000E5C62]
That is the badge worn by Dymnos, our Master of Arms. Why did she have it?

Id: [0x000E5C63]
I will find out soon enough.

Id: [0x000E5C67]
This way. We will line them up. It will be easier for Suphia.

Id: [0x000E5C68]
Your band is much smaller than I imagined.

Id: [0x000E5C69]
Small but united. We fight for one another. I am merely one of them, spared by the gods this time.

Id: [0x000E5C6E]
I am nearly finished. Help the rebels.

Id: [0x000E5C6F]
They need you more than I do right now.

Id: [0x000E5C70]
I can take care of this on my own.

Id: [0x000E5C89]
Their wounds are severe, but they'll live if Suphia is anything like Nefertari.

Id: [0x000E5C8B]
They have found us!

Id: [0x000E5C93]
No! Stay away from me!

Id: [0x000E5C96]
It's Suphia! She lit the brazier! Why would she draw the soldiers to us!?

Id: [0x000E5C9A]
Death to Cleo! We are the Gabinianis and Egypt is ours! OUUURAH!!!

Id: [0x000E5CA7]
It is rare that our cargo is a goddess. I apologize, we have no Kings or Queens on our ship, only gods and goddesses. So you should fit right in.

Id: [0x000E5CAD]
Come, we must make haste.

Id: [0x000E5CAE]
We need to save my rebel boys.

Id: [0x000E5CAF]
Okay.

Id: [0x000E5CB5]
The omens... It was you. Why?

Id: [0x000E5CDC]
There's no room for pretty in our war.

Id: [0x000E5CE0]
We have the natron, at least. We will do what we can.

Id: [0x000E5CE6]
Suphia!?

Id: [0x000E5CE7]
She was Rudjek's mistress.

Id: [0x000E5CE8]
Was... She is dead...

Id: [0x000E5DCA]
[BIRD CALL]

Id: [0x000E5DF6]
Save my boys Bayek.

Id: [0x000E5DF7]
I'll take care of it.

Id: [0x000E5E22]
This way, Bayek.

Id: [0x000E5E23]
Do not insult me. Must I really wait on you?

Id: [0x000E5E25]
This is important. Please do not do that again.

Id: [0x000E5E26]
Suphia, give some frankincense to the men at the pool, would you?

Id: [0x000E5E2A]
Any luck with the torches?

Id: [0x000E5E2B]
It must be you, Bayek. You must prove your worth to Anubis.

Id: [0x000E5E2D]
There were charms left beside each one. Does that mean anything to you?

Id: [0x000E5E2E]
Most likely to ward off the omen.

Id: [0x000E5E2F]
I will keep my eyes open. In the meantime, some rebels nearby need treatment. I normally make the trips, but I am needed here.

Id: [0x000E5E70]
Here is the statue.

Id: [0x000E5E71]
Khnum, sculptor of children. He will battle Apep in your place.

Id: [0x000E5E72]
This ritual needs your mind's strength. Sit by my side and meditate as I speak with the gods.

Id: [0x000E5E89]
I...do you...

Id: [0x000E5E8A]
Yes? 

Id: [0x000E5E8B]
Visiting Khemu like that....

Id: [0x000E5E8C]
It's not right...Every morning...every one of those damn morning, I...

Id: [0x000E5E8D]
...you hope that he'll be in the next room,

Id: [0x000E5E8E]
that you'll hear his voice calling you from the garden...

Id: [0x000E5E8F]
I miss him so much...

Id: [0x000E5E90]
Every day I relive this moment, how everything changed...

Id: [0x000E5E91]
His face Aya...that light fading in his eyes.

Id: [0x000E5E92]
I could have...I should have saved him! 

Id: [0x000E5E93]
And I should have been with him when it happened.

Id: [0x000E5E94]
I know you Bayek. I know that deep inside, you think you have to carry our child loss all by yourself.

Id: [0x000E5E95]
He died because of me Aya...I was selfish...proud...and...

Id: [0x000E5E96]
Those men Bayek...the men we've tracked, the men we've killed,

Id: [0x000E5E97]
they are the real responsible, and you know it!

Id: [0x000E5E98]
I can't explain why...this vengeance...

Id: [0x000E5E99]
all that we've done...I...I can't find peace.

Id: [0x000E5E9A]
We'll never find peace...we've lost a part of us.

Id: [0x000E5E9B]
All we can do is make sure that our pain serves a greater good.

Id: [0x000E5E9C]
Protecting people, preventing what happened to us from happening again.

Id: [0x000E5E9D]
Here we are...

Id: [0x000E5E9E]
I feared that moment so many times the past few years.

Id: [0x000E5EA6]
Honey! I'm Home!!

Id: [0x000E5EA7]
Oh no! He arrives! You must leave now!

Id: [0x000E5EA8]
I shall never leave you to the hand of that brute!

Id: [0x000E5EA9]
Bayek! Take care of him so I may comfort this damsel in distress.

Id: [0x000E5EC2]
The Seer offers this amulet to keep you from further harm.

Id: [0x000E5EC3]
My children cannot eat a stone.

Id: [0x000E5EC4]
I cannot do more for you than this. May your luck change course.

Id: [0x000E5EC5]
Pardon my rudeness. You have already risked yourself to save me.

Id: [0x000E5EC6]
I will claim my reward elsewhere.

Id: [0x000E5EC7]
I've nothing to reward you with, except my thanks.

Id: [0x000E5EC8]
The Seer sends this amulet. His visions show you are in need of protection.

Id: [0x000E5EC9]
Why would I want this piece of junk?

Id: [0x000E5ECA]
Just take it so we can conclude our business.

Id: [0x000E5ED5]
I am ready to speak of my dream.

Id: [0x000E5ED6]
Of course, Deliverer. But first you must help me.

Id: [0x000E5ED7]
How?

Id: [0x000E5ED9]
An adventurer, a philanderer, and a beggar are all at risk.

Id: [0x000E5EDB]
Give each an amulet to guard against the darkness.

Id: [0x000E5F19]
I wonder what tale Turo will tell me.

Id: [0x000E5F24]
What's this? Ugh. His hand was eaten. A hyena must have swallowed the ring, too. This is absurd.

Id: [0x000E5F3E]
I don't know what you're talking about!

Id: [0x000E5F3F]
My child. You are not at fault, I am here to help.

Id: [0x000E5F41]
She was forced to lie? What does she mean? I should check Menkaure's pyramid.

Id: [0x000E5F45]
I'm just digging around. I can dig, can't I?

Id: [0x000E5F49]
Please, don't be angry!

Id: [0x000E5F59]
Do you really think you can get Anta out safely?

Id: [0x000E5F5A]
The bandits are camped in the hills west of the Hemon Tombs. Anta must be there!

Id: [0x000E5F5F]
Your notes are being held by bandits.

Id: [0x000E5F60]
Bandits!?

Id: [0x000E5F6A]
Have you seen my Book of the Dead in your travels, Medjay? I went all the way to Memphis to buy it!

Id: [0x000E5F6B]
No. How was it lost?

Id: [0x000E5F6C]
Bandits. They came from the dunes nearby.

Id: [0x000E5F70]
I am not going home until I--

Id: [0x000E5F71]
Father, the Book is gone.

Id: [0x000E5F72]
There you are, Father! We are going home.

Id: [0x000E5F79]
I should have a look around the pyramids. I can finally find those notes.

Id: [0x000E5F7D]
Corteseos' notes. He will be happy to see these.

Id: [0x000E5F80]
Eh! I bring good news.

Id: [0x000E5F81]
My notes! By Zeus! I can't believe it! I owe you my life!

Id: [0x000E5F83]
Is it over!? Are the bandits gone?

Id: [0x000E5F84]
These kids need a safe passage back to Memphis. Right?

Id: [0x000E5F85]
A bandit den. Well at least we know it was not spirits that stole the tool.

Id: [0x000E6003]
...or wash the stains of blood off my hands, for example.

Id: [0x000E6004]
You do not need to remind me.

Id: [0x000E600A]
Why are so many of your people ailing?

Id: [0x000E6014]
Whatever it is, we have suffered grave injuries trying to reignite them. Some have even vanished.

Id: [0x000E6017]
Natron has other uses, though. I could use it to disinfect a wound...

Id: [0x000E6045]
By the gods... Ruia! What happened?

Id: [0x000E6047]
She was thrown to her death from the Pigeon Tower.

Id: [0x000E6051]
Then let us begin.

Id: [0x000E725E]
Hail to you, Osiris! Your limbs are lasting, you do not know corruption.

Id: [0x000E725F]
Hail to you, Osiris! Your limbs are lasting, you do not know corruption.

Id: [0x000E7260]
There are no worms with you, you are not repugnant.

Id: [0x000E7261]
There are no worms with you, you are not repugnant.

Id: [0x000E7262]
Here is the tomb of Osiris, motionless, motionless like Osiris; motionless his limbs like Osiris.

Id: [0x000E7263]
Here is the tomb of Osiris, motionless, motionless like Osiris; motionless his limbs like Osiris.

Id: [0x000E7264]
Let them not remain motionless, let them not corrupt.

Id: [0x000E7265]
Let them not remain motionless, let them not corrupt.

Id: [0x000E7266]
They move not, they stir not: be it done for them as for Osiris. I am Osiris.

Id: [0x000E7267]
They move not, they stir not: be it done for them as for Osiris. I am Osiris.

Id: [0x000E989F]
You have mine as well.

Id: [0x000EA536]
I have found what you need, Taimhotep.

Id: [0x000EA537]
The Seer spoke truth when he named you Deliverer.

Id: [0x000EA538]
My ritual must be performed in the moon's shadow, at the base of the pyramid of Djoser.

Id: [0x000EA53A]
Is there anything I can do to ease her?

Id: [0x000EA541]
What's  this? looks Like an Artefact...

Id: [0x000EA542]
Almost like he was guarding it. Why would he have it?

Id: [0x000EA543]
Perhaps I could ask the Harbourmaster if he's seen something like this...

Id: [0x000EA548]
Hey, have you seen these before?

Id: [0x000EA549]
Could it be? looks like the items my brother was looking for.

Id: [0x000EA54A]
They are artefact from the old times, said they were gifts from the gods.

Id: [0x000EA54B]
But they were also cursed items, they made them blood thirsty.

Id: [0x000EA54C]
I heard news from my brother, he said he left the bandits 

Id: [0x000EA54D]
He said he is exploring the underground of memphis to seek artefacts...

Id: [0x000EA556]
What am I gonna do, I will die for sure oh gods... oh... are you here to punish me too?

Id: [0x000EA557]
What has happened here? Were these animals sick?

Id: [0x000EA558]
It was the Romans! They claim I haven't paid my taxes! And they came and killed my cattle!

Id: [0x000EA559]
And they say they will come again if I don't find the silphium I own them...

Id: [0x000EA55A]
But I don't own them anything! I sent the cart already!

Id: [0x000EA55B]
Wait, wait. Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x000EA55C]
The law says that I have to grow this damned silphium.

Id: [0x000EA55D]
I have to pay a tax for the pleasure of killing my soil - a cart with the damned thing.

Id: [0x000EA55E]
But the thing is, silphium refuses to be cultivated...

Id: [0x000EA55F]
So I work all season and get a handful of silphium,

Id: [0x000EA560]
I go and buy some from the luckier people who can grow it, I send them the cart,

Id: [0x000EA561]
And the Romans come and tell me the fucking cart didn't arrive!

Id: [0x000EA562]
Now they are going to come again and I don't know what are they going to do.

Id: [0x000EA563]
What is your name? And where should have this cart arrived?

Id: [0x000EA564]
I am Kleytos. The cart should have been in the depot in Balagrae. It has my sign on it.

Id: [0x000EA565]
Kleitos, I will see what I can do. I'm going there anyway.

Id: [0x000EA566]
Thank you, kind man! I will pray to the gods you have luck with them dirty Romans!

Id: [0x000EA575]
Thank you for coming back, I believe we are ready to proceed

Id: [0x000EA576]
We are going to share a dream to seek the next step

Id: [0x000EA577]
Let's start.

Id: [0x000EADEC]
Of course... You're Anta, their protector?

Id: [0x000EADEF]
You know your way back...

Id: [0x000EADF1]
Come visit us!

Id: [0x000EADF6]
You, poor, poor girl.

Id: [0x000EADF7]
May you walk in the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x000EAE15]
You know about the ring!?

Id: [0x000EAE1E]
Senu? Where have you flown off to?

Id: [0x000EAE2D]
Yes. And who are you?

Id: [0x000EAE30]
Good! The soldiers are reeling, but it won't be long before reinforcements arrive. Come.

Id: [0x000EAE31]
We are witnessing the end of an age.

Id: [0x000EAE32]
There's the mast from the burnt ship.

Id: [0x000EAE4A]
Aristo is taking Eudoros to court for plagiarism?

Id: [0x000EAE4C]
No!

Id: [0x000EAE4D]
Eudoros stole whole paragraphs from Aristo's book about the Nile!

Id: [0x000EAE4E]
His wife? She works herself into histrionics over nothing.

Id: [0x000EAE71]
I dealt with the bandits who stole her. I suspect they stole Saganaki on behalf of your blue rivals.

Id: [0x000EAE74]
Gods blast them! We'll have to beat the Blues in the races, to teach them shame and humiliation.

Id: [0x000EAE77]
You fools! You let them steal Saganaki!

Id: [0x000EAEF6]
Eudoros! Killed!

Id: [0x000EAEF8]
Oh, dear gods! He's been murdered!

Id: [0x000EAEFA]
Look at the blood!

Id: [0x000EAEFC]
But he was so handsome!

Id: [0x000EAEFE]
It's Eudoros! Poor soul!

Id: [0x000EAEFF]
This is the papyrus...and the offering. Both Tefibi and Tjepu will be happy.

Id: [0x000EAF06]
This is very much like the first market. All these markets look the same to me.

Id: [0x000EAF0C]
Roman cat-kickers! How would you feel if I kicked your gods!?

Id: [0x000EAF10]
Still, Eudoros has a lot to answer for.

Id: [0x000EAF41]
Nebti! My seni! Why didn't you come searching for me!? I was locked in a cell for days! Nek! Where is the ring?

Id: [0x000EAFCC]
Please, sweet Iset, grant me release!

Id: [0x000EAFCD]
Why call on the gods, fool? They have clearly abandoned us!

Id: [0x000EAFCE]
Shh! Quiet! You will just bring them back to us!

Id: [0x000EAFD0]
You there, please, if you have any decency in your heart you will free us!

Id: [0x000EB006]
Shut your mouth, wretch!

Id: [0x000EB008]
If you don't quiet down, I'll make sure you're thrown into the field, next!

Id: [0x000EB00A]
Beware the guards! Free us!

Id: [0x000EB00B]
Simple farmers, bones ground up, heads like smashed cabbages.

Id: [0x000EB01A]
Does anyone know Iuseneb?

Id: [0x000EB01B]
What? That's me!

Id: [0x000EB137]
You are rather celebrated among my group. We spent years tracking Rudjek, only to learn you made waste of him singlehandedly.

Id: [0x000EB138]
You are not incorrect.

Id: [0x000EB148]
We'll be targeted if we so much as take a piss nearby. You are unknown to them. Bring the scribe to us. He'll tell us what we need to know.

Id: [0x000EB14B]
It won't be long before he comes to. I need to bring him back to Theodoros.

Id: [0x000EB190]
I should return these gold Sobeks to that odious priest.

Id: [0x000EB204]
Just how many of you are there?

Id: [0x000EB205]
Only my brother, sister and I. Don't harm them! I'm the one responsible.

Id: [0x000EB206]
I want the notes you stole from the Greek geographer you knocked out.

Id: [0x000EB207]
We've given everything to the bandits from the hills west of the Hemon Tombs. They have Anta too and won't give her back unless we steal for them.

Id: [0x000EB20A]
Bandits who profit from children. Neket iadets. Get your siblings and stay out of sight. You have my word, I will return Anta to you.

Id: [0x000EB217]
In the meantime, we must prepare our attack. Some of our brothers are stationed just west of Soknopaiou.

Id: [0x000EB27D]
You find anything yet?

Id: [0x000EB27E]
No, that blasted Zervos hid his papers as well as he hid himself.

Id: [0x000EB280]
Keep looking. If we find something to hang him on, Sefetu will reward us!

Id: [0x000EB281]
And if we don't find anything?

Id: [0x000EB282]
Then you get to tell Sefetu. He won't be pleased, Serapis knows.

Id: [0x000EB283]
I'll keep looking.

Id: [0x000EB28F]
You have made things better here.

Id: [0x000EB290]
You clearly have people who are willing to help you out, Zervos. Why don't you take on Sefetu?

Id: [0x000EB291]
Sefetu is too powerful, too greedy. He knows there is no one strong enough to stop him. We are not fighting men.

Id: [0x000EB292]
Sefetu surrounds himself with soldiers. His base at Fort Nikiou is guarded with ballistae. Fool that I am, I helped him import them.

Id: [0x000EB293]
May Amun watch over you.

Id: [0x000EB2B6]
This is a tighter squeeze than the caves west of Siwa.

Id: [0x000EB2B8]
We were smaller in those days.

Id: [0x000EB33B]
My cousins have a farm nearby. It may be untouched. Please, help me bring Pentu!

Id: [0x000EB33D]
Of course. I will take him.

Id: [0x000EB348]
The prisons of Fort Nikiou.

Id: [0x000EB35A]
Oh! Wha-what do you mean?

Id: [0x000EB367]
Please. If he does not work, Sefetu's tax collectors will do something terrible.

Id: [0x000EB368]
I am not sure I can convince him... but I will keep an eye out for these tax collectors. Perhaps I can persuade them to leave you alone.

Id: [0x000EB36D]
The Queen is here!

Id: [0x000EB372]
Iset will speak to the people!

Id: [0x000EB373]
The Goddess blesses us!

Id: [0x000EB467]
Let me get you out of there.

Id: [0x000EB468]
Hurry. These bandits breed like rats.

Id: [0x000EB487]
The desperate are so rarely polite.

Id: [0x000EB488]
My brothers! You have slain my brothers. You were supposed to help me, not him!

Id: [0x000EB4AD]
Guard A: You're going to pay for this, cheater

Id: [0x000EB528]
With these dark matters settled, we can finally prepare for the Festival of Apis.

Id: [0x000EB547]
Thank the gods you've returned

Id: [0x000EB548]
What happened?

Id: [0x000EB549]
That ptolemaic general attacked our camp

Id: [0x000EB54A]
Had the scout returned here first?

Id: [0x000EB54B]
What? Yes, how do you know?

Id: [0x000EB54C]
He actually managed to retrieve Alexander's shield

Id: [0x000EB54D]
Yes, the general seized the shield and captured my student, said he wanted to make an example out of him

Id: [0x000EB54E]
Please save, him, they must have brought him to their fortress south

Id: [0x000EB54F]
I'll take care of that general as well, make him an example

Id: [0x000EB550]
Yes, he should be at one of his camps nearby, thank you for doing all this

Id: [0x000EB57D]
The masses are the cattle of the gods, driven by the herdsman's whip.

Id: [0x000EB626]
Important delivery for Caesar!

Id: [0x000EB627]
Out of our way, Caesar needs those now!

Id: [0x000EB628]
Don't put your  filthy hands on the rugs. 

Id: [0x000EB629]
If we drop this because of you, you'll be in big trouble!

Id: [0x000EB62A]
We don't have all night, move away.

Id: [0x000EB62B]
Onwards! We don't have much time!

Id: [0x000EB62C]
It feels great to be back in Alexandria.

Id: [0x000EB62D]
I will take back what is destined to be mine.

Id: [0x000EB62E]
This passage we are headed to, what should we expect?

Id: [0x000EB62F]
It is a cave that was partially dug to merge with the cistern system.

Id: [0x000EB630]
Not many people know about this.

Id: [0x000EB631]
The passage was excavated under the reign of Ptolemy 3 as an alternate way to bring supplies in the palace.

Id: [0x000EB632]
Although it is not used for that purpose anymore, it was kept to be used as a quick escape route.

Id: [0x000EB633]
It should be a clear passage... until the docks near the palace.

Id: [0x000EB634]
Let's keep moving!

Id: [0x000EB675]
This evil boy has profaned the gods. His punishment will be an example, and an atonement. His hands for thievery, his tongue for lying.

Id: [0x000EB676]
But I am telling the truth!

Id: [0x000EB687]
Priest, I have your precious golden Sobeks. Your novice spoke the truth.

Id: [0x000EB688]
This useless boy has been constant trouble. Many more punishments await him, for his carelessness.

Id: [0x000EB68B]
Priest, what has the boy done to deserve this?

Id: [0x000EB68C]
This has nothing to do with you. Back away. The boy will get what he deserves.

Id: [0x000EB68D]
I serve Sobek! I serve Sobek! I am his slave!

Id: [0x000EB8D6]
Aya! My love!

Id: [0x000EB8DE]
Two axes isn't enough axes.

Id: [0x000EB8DF]
Let this queen die. The only dignity she has left, is death.

Id: [0x000EB9E0]
I see. I am not one of Sefetu's men.

Id: [0x000EB9E1]
I don't know anything about it. I don't stick my neck out. I have nothing to tell you.

Id: [0x000EBA14]
The gods have cursed me! I lost my f-farm and m-my wife to my brother, in Y-Y-Yamu, and now I've lost what little I owned!

Id: [0x000EBA16]
I did not stay to find out! They were the last gift I got from my father, Khufu and Chiera! And-and I left them there! With all I own!

Id: [0x000EBA17]
When I am out that way, I will see what I can find. For now, do what you can on your new house.

Id: [0x000EBA1B]
Yes? What can I help you with?

Id: [0x000EBA1C]
Ramessu said you found strange hieroglyphs in your house?

Id: [0x000EBA28]
Enough! At Nehi's house, he showed me strange writings.

Id: [0x000EBA2A]
Nothing to worry you, friend. Three others have said the same thing. But these signs are too old to be made sense of.

Id: [0x000EBA2D]
I will check with them.

Id: [0x000EBA2E]
My soul is troubled. The Pharaoh's guards have yet to forget Tefibi's actions.

Id: [0x000EBA2F]
I will find us a better path, Medjay. Never fear.

Id: [0x000EBA35]
Find my poets, Bayek.

Id: [0x000EBA3C]
Time, friend. I must be off.

Id: [0x000EBA41]
Find the skin if you are able. May Serapis guide you.

Id: [0x000EBA42]
There is no way all this blood is from one cat.

Id: [0x000EBA43]
A Roman soldier, dead. Only one wound. He bled out quick.

Id: [0x000EBA50]
Who's this? Another of Eudoros' sycophants come to sneer? Leave me alone with my woes.

Id: [0x000EBB05]
His name was Icarus, the glory of the raucous Hippodrome, the much-lauded and short-lived beloved of Kanopos.

Id: [0x000EBB06]
Jealous Fate, numbering his victories instead of his years, thought him old, and stole him away in his twenty-fifth year.

Id: [0x000EBB07]
Icarus, a champion from thirteen when he won his first race, to his thousandth win as Miliarius, there is no honor higher.

Id: [0x000EBB08]
His horses, as blessed by the gods as he, Abraxas, and Santana, whom he rode to victory in over five hundred races, the definition of equine pride.

Id: [0x000EBB09]
Icarus, lead racer for the populist Prasina Green, won them wreaths of olive, laurel, and pine. Now they are lost in a turbulent sea.

Id: [0x000EBB69]
Oh! Tragedy, that you, Icarus should be cut down in the bloom of youth, and be summoned so soon to harness the dusky steeds of Serapis.

Id: [0x000EBB6A]
The chariot race was never long enough when you drove with the lightning, but oh, why should your own race have ended in a flash?

Id: [0x000EBB82]
The staff he is holding. The markings.

Id: [0x000EBB87]
So? Is Aya with you?

Id: [0x000EBB8D]
You are the taster?

Id: [0x000EBB8E]
Yes, I am he.

Id: [0x000EBB8F]
Teta the baker asked me to bring you to her.

Id: [0x000EBB90]
I am weak with hunger and with love. Will you carry me to Teta?

Id: [0x000EBBB4]
They kept the children caged.

Id: [0x000EBBC6]
Must have been a blaze to make Ra jealous.

Id: [0x000EBBC7]
Yes, they say the ship caught fire in the harbor last night.

Id: [0x000EBBC8]
Know how it happened?

Id: [0x000EBC87]
You're drunk. You don't know what you're saying-

Id: [0x000EBC8F]
You should have your father make me the lead!

Id: [0x000EBC90]
Are you daft? You'd wreck in a moment!

Id: [0x000EBC91]
Listen, Icarus was my friend. He taught me...hic...everything I know about riding. Driving. Steering a chariot.

Id: [0x000EBC92]
Just talk to him! I'll restore glory to your house!

Id: [0x000EBC9F]
The cave is a real place! One drachma and I, the great philosopher Tefibi, will take you there myself!

Id: [0x000EBCA0]
Come, take the Platonic tour of Alexandria! Four obols and I can show you Plato's grave!

Id: [0x000EBCA1]
Learn the Socratic Method! Only four lessons needed with me, the great philosopher Tefibi!

Id: [0x000EBCA2]
Tefibi the Great will give you all the answers you need to live a prosperous life!

Id: [0x000EBCE6]
You alive?

Id: [0x000EBD02]
Perhaps Phanos the Younger should follow Socrates' path. Phanos the Deader. Ha!

Id: [0x000EBD0C]
You dare speak against the great Pharaoh Tommery XIII!? Quick, prepare them for execution.

Id: [0x000EBD11]
You are a blessing from the gods! He receives the rites in the small temple.

Id: [0x000EBD12]
He was in despair that his ka would not join my mother's.

Id: [0x000EBD13]
Where is his body? It is not too late.

Id: [0x000EBD44]
Welcome, brother.

Id: [0x000EBDEE]
Caesar's soldiers should have opened the door by now.

Id: [0x000EBDEF]
It's been quite a while, they should have been back by now.

Id: [0x000EBDF0]
I feel privileged to be able to see visit the sacred place.

Id: [0x000EBDF8]
Hey, why are you burning the dead? Don't you fear the gods? Their souls will be forever cursed.

Id: [0x000EBDF9]
I'm sorry to do it, but I have no choice in this. The gods themselves have afflicted us with a pestilence. The dead must be burned to save the living.

Id: [0x000EBDFA]
What pestilence? Is there a plague?

Id: [0x000EBDFB]
Truly, I don't know. Elders have begun falling sick. Children have died clutching their bellies in agony as their parents watch on, lifeless in their beds.

Id: [0x000EBDFC]
This would be cruel even for the angriest of gods.

Id: [0x000EBDFD]
No one cares about us. Any help would be appreciated...in the Faiyum, the poor aren't worth spit.

Id: [0x000EBDFE]
Tell me about the food you eat. Where does it come from?

Id: [0x000EBDFF]
A merchant makes it for the poor here. It's not much, but at least it's something. We're thankful. You're welcome to try some.

Id: [0x000EBE00]
By the gods no. I do not know how you stomach it. I need to talk to the merchant. Where can I find him?

Id: [0x000EBE02]
His house is to the south of the town market. I can take you.

Id: [0x000EBE09]
This is the home of the merchant who provides the food.

Id: [0x000EBE0A]
Some are just more equal than others.

Id: [0x000EBE12]
If you were reasonable, I wouldn't have to do this!

Id: [0x000EBE13]
We could have worked this out!

Id: [0x000EBE14]
This merchant of death was murdering the poor for their land. His love of money was the real sickness. Faiyum won't miss him. The dead can rest. There will be no more burning.

Id: [0x000EBE17]
How may I help you? This is my home. Are you lost?

Id: [0x000EBE18]
You can explain to me why you have been poisoning the poor. My guess is so you can take their land. It is easy if they are dead.

Id: [0x000EBE19]
You're referring to the trouble in the slums? Whatever you've heard, I assure you, you misunderstand. I do what I can to help.

Id: [0x000EBE1A]
I have seen your kitchen, merchant. I know what you are doing. And I will see that you are brought to justice.

Id: [0x000EBE1B]
Oh... I see. Well that changes things. Now you're trespassing. And I have the right to protect myself. Men!

Id: [0x000EBE53]
Why did the Romans bring you here?

Id: [0x000EBE54]
To feed their hunger for war and conquest. They have ballista. We load it with a substance of hideous, burning devastation.

Id: [0x000EBE58]
Then I will find this merchant of death. Go to your mother, she will be glad to see you safe.

Id: [0x000EBECB]
Triangles make the world round.

Id: [0x000EBED0]
Are you unwell?

Id: [0x000EBED1]
Learn all three points of Pythagoras!

Id: [0x000EBED5]
Oh, I… The leader told the others to meet him at the Necropolis… I think.

Id: [0x000EBED6]
The world is hard.

Id: [0x000EBEF8]
Eat this plant, covered in oil, and find the true meaning of the kosmos.

Id: [0x000EBEF9]
Only the Great Tefibi offers enlightenment in one easy step!

Id: [0x000EBEFD]
There must be another way inside the tomb.

Id: [0x000EBF4F]
Soris, you are supposed to hide!

Id: [0x000EBF50]
Father told you not to play with the sacred animals, Soris!

Id: [0x000EBF54]
Look at me, Keba! I'm on the roof!

Id: [0x000EBF56]
Do not hide in the well! You will get stuck there!

Id: [0x000EBF61]
[Onos of getting poisoned]

Id: [0x000EBF66]
I'm sure Soris is hiding near the animal cages. <LF>

Id: [0x000EBF67]
He likes to pretend that he's a gladiator.

Id: [0x000EBF68]
Soris would be better off with opponents his size.

Id: [0x000EBF6A]
Do you want to hear a secret?

Id: [0x000EBF6B]
Not if it's about your father.

Id: [0x000EBF6C]
My sister always sneaks up to the temple roof at night to look at the stars.

Id: [0x000EBF6D]
But don't tell anyone -- the priests would be so angry!

Id: [0x000EBF6F]
Wherever Keba hid, he's probably in trouble.

Id: [0x000EBF70]
He's always getting stuck in places. Once, we found him in a tree!

Id: [0x000EBF7E]
Uggghhh.

Id: [0x000EBF7F]
Hah. You are old. Time for me to dunk my head.

Id: [0x000EBF80]
Nikias? Who?

Id: [0x000EBF81]
Don't bullshit me. I saw you. What, you think his father will just welcome you onto the Prasina Green team?

Id: [0x000EBF95]
Master Taharqa!

Id: [0x000EBF98]
Now I'll prove to them I can match them in wits.

Id: [0x000EBF9A]
I worry about him forever. It is hard to understand when you do not have children.

Id: [0x000EBFAC]
Bayek? I did not expect to see you here!

Id: [0x000EBFD2]
Beautiful, isn't she?

Id: [0x000EBFD3]
Bright eyes, flawless gait. She wants to win.

Id: [0x000EBFD5]
You know a thing or two about horses. Nikias, who is your friend?

Id: [0x000EBFD7]
My father, Philocrates of Kanopos, son of Themistocles of Kanopos.

Id: [0x000EBFDC]
Let's show my father your natural skill!

Id: [0x000EBFDE]
Careful!

Id: [0x000EBFE0]
Tighter on the reins!

Id: [0x000EBFE2]
Watch the statuary!

Id: [0x000EBFE9]
Sorry, sir!

Id: [0x000EBFEE]
Nikias! Horse thieves! Here! The balls on them!

Id: [0x000EBFF1]
She's my winningest horse! You have to get her back!

Id: [0x000EC015]
By Serapis, you did it! I cannot believe it! I was convinced we'd never see Saganaki, or my son, again.

Id: [0x000EC03C]
Worse yet, they jailed my actors - all among the finest poets of Alexandria.

Id: [0x000EC03F]
They say if I attempt to put on the play, I will be put to death.

Id: [0x000EC055]
Thank you! But, there are two more of us. They escaped.

Id: [0x000EC0A6]
Kof Kof...What happened???

Id: [0x000EC0A7]
It came from bellow the temple...the vault...

Id: [0x000EC0A8]
Dammit! We're too late!

Id: [0x000EC0A9]
What have they done!

Id: [0x000EC0AA]
Ptolemaic! Passed out...They also got touch by that blast.

Id: [0x000EC0AB]
By the gods...what is this place?

Id: [0x000EC0AC]
This gruel is not fit for rats, let alone people. The strong spices are not for taste, they are disguising the rot. I need to talk with whoever made it.

Id: [0x000EC0AD]
My children, your hunger is known. Turn to Sobek for your nourishment.

Id: [0x000EC0AE]
Sobek has provided a way. Though the food is humble, it gives life. Eat with thanksgiving, and trust in he who is Pointed of Teeth.

Id: [0x000EC0AF]
The Lord of Waters may take our souls, but we will all rejoice in The Field of Reeds!

Id: [0x000EC0B0]
The Splashing One, who came from the Great Goddess! He who made the herbage green. Lord of the Nile! Dua Sobek!

Id: [0x000EC1EE]
Brothers at sea! Today we carry a precious cargo, Queen Cleopatra, Great Lady in Perfection, She of the Sedge and Bee, with so many other cocksure titles my breath falters just to think of them!

Id: [0x000EC1F1]
Now if you'll direct your attention to the fore, you'll notice we have some friends bearing down upon us. Emissaries of our little Pharaoh!

Id: [0x000EC20D]
The fleet awaits your command, Aya.

Id: [0x000EC20E]
Our catapults will fire upon your order.

Id: [0x000EC20F]
Don't save our ammunition, Aya! Waste it and them!

Id: [0x000EC210]
The fleet is at your disposal. One signal and fire will burst upon them.

Id: [0x000EC211]
This is not a battle we'll win without catapults! Alalala!

Id: [0x000EC218]
Send our arrows!

Id: [0x000EC219]
Give them a taste of our fire!

Id: [0x000EC21E]
Take them you slackers!

Id: [0x000EC21F]
Cut them off! Don't let them tack!

Id: [0x000EC220]
Show no mercy!

Id: [0x000EC221]
Send them to the abyss!

Id: [0x000EC222]
This reminds me of a day twenty years back when I sailed with a group of pirates.

Id: [0x000EC223]
The Sicilians was it?

Id: [0x000EC224]
Ah, you heard the stories! That's right, I was a hired hull then too. They were planning an inland raid on Antioch, and needed a few extra sails.

Id: [0x000EC225]
It was my first and only dip into the life of a scoundrel. I prefer having a shred of decency. Only a shred.

Id: [0x000EC228]
Ptolemites! Burn them! Alalalaaaaa!

Id: [0x000EC229]
Well done there! Seacraft comes naturally to you.

Id: [0x000EC22A]
Easier to sail about when the sea is empty of ships trying to sink you.

Id: [0x000EC22B]
Won't a dozen missing triremes not alert the main fleet?

Id: [0x000EC22C]
It will take some time for them to find the wreckage. Onwards.

Id: [0x000EC22D]
Damastes please, shut up! We press on.

Id: [0x000EC22E]
With caution. We're not yet in calmer waters.

Id: [0x000EC244]
And that is the game! Ah, the god's have such a humor, Aya. The day I met you, was the day danger found me again. Bayek you are one lucky Medjay!

Id: [0x000EC245]
Should I apologize for putting you back to work?

Id: [0x000EC246]
Not at all, not at all! My blood runs quick now, with the roar of battle!

Id: [0x000EC247]
By Zeus! I have not seen this much action since the earliest days of Cleopatra's father.

Id: [0x000EC248]
Let's not celebrate too roundly, old man. We're afloat in the sea with a cargo worth a thousand ships.

Id: [0x000EC2E8]
Calm down, I won't hurt you, just tell me where the dioptra is.

Id: [0x000EC2E9]
It was lunchtime and my wife brought me a fresh roasted chicken leg for lunch which was nice as it has been an eon since I had…

Id: [0x000EC2EA]
Oh I see. Well I left the dioptra in the cave and when I came back it was gone. Scrobbled away by wolves, spirits or worse!

Id: [0x000EC2EB]
What does this dioptra look like?

Id: [0x000EC2EC]
Like a brazier, made of three parts. A bit you see through, a bit you measure with…

Id: [0x000EC2ED]
I will find it, just try not to die of fright before then.

Id: [0x000EC38D]
Their home, not far from here. Don't worry about me. I'll find my way back to the theatre.

Id: [0x000EC3A2]
I hear hemlock is very fresh this time of year.

Id: [0x000EC3A3]
To think he almost performed this treasonous garbage.

Id: [0x000EC3B2]
It is by our choice, not orders that we defend our Pleiad and our City. Your censorship causes no love for the people! We will win!

Id: [0x000EC3B3]
What will you do? What will you say? What do you feel, fool?

Id: [0x000EC3B4]
We marvel at gall, we dare to risk neck and speak alone against Tommery.

Id: [0x000EC3B5]
Hold not against me, my love of free will. And I count the immigrants as among the bran of the body politik! Foreigners are this city!

Id: [0x000EC3B6]
Every ear in this city will make war with my sister. You poets are filthy beggars.

Id: [0x000EC3B7]
We die for the Pleiad! You can kill us. But not our poems. Not our love for the true warriors. Your killing of us lacks art.

Id: [0x000EC3BC]
Would not know truth if it hit them in the head!

Id: [0x000EC3BE]
The regime has ruined Alexandria! We need new leadership!

Id: [0x000EC3C2]
I will not be censored by Gennadios' phylakitai!

Id: [0x000EC3D3]
[Rex immortalis](Immortal king.)

Id: [0x000EC3D8]
I wept at the base of his statue in Rome. At thirty, he was a god with an empire stretching across the known world.

Id: [0x000EC3D9]
What have I done with my five long decades here on earth? [Ita me di iuvent](So help me, gods)!

Id: [0x000EC3E9]
How long before the Queen stops impressing Caesar and starts impressing us?

Id: [0x000EC3EA]
Our needs are hers as well. She will deliver.

Id: [0x000EC3FF]
No, not that one. He is too...handsome.

Id: [0x000EC401]
You! Get over here. Er, no. Not you. You will not do, either.

Id: [0x000EC403]
I need someone for one quick job. It's good coin. No, not you, you, keep going. Do not stop here.

Id: [0x000EC405]
How I wish those bandits had not killed my man Arikonos. Poor fool. At least the jackals had a good meal.

Id: [0x000EC409]
Priest, is this the Great Temple of Ptah?

Id: [0x000EC40A]
It is. But you do not want to worship in it.

Id: [0x000EC40B]
The temple is cursed. The whole of Memphis is cursed!

Id: [0x000EC40C]
But I have business here.

Id: [0x000EC40D]
If you wish to provoke the gods, that is up to you.

Id: [0x000EC410]
You've found it! Your new home! A miracle of a man's labor! The great work begins!

Id: [0x000EC411]
No, that's not wha-

Id: [0x000EC418]
Speak to some of our new inhabitants, like Nehi. He can tell you how liberating it is to leave the past behind.

Id: [0x000EC434]
I am a Medjay. I solve problems.

Id: [0x000EC435]
Good! I have one. A most precious treasure, which must be delivered today.

Id: [0x000EC436]
You! That insignia… You are a man of honor? There are so few remaining.

Id: [0x000EC43D]
The god statue was stolen long ago apparently. By a nearby temple... Maybe the idol is still there. 

Id: [0x000EC450]
Young miss, it's so nice to see you again. As you asked, she has been given new shoes.

Id: [0x000EC459]
Now, what of my pay?

Id: [0x000EC45E]
The deal was only to get you home, not to pay for your horse.

Id: [0x000EC45F]
Of course. Uh, I'll discuss it with your father.

Id: [0x000EC469]
I am looking for my son

Id: [0x000EC46A]
OK i am going to look for it

Id: [0x000EC46B]
Great very good thank you

Id: [0x000EC47D]
Your role in that insane order comes to an end, Pothinus. Face your judgement.

Id: [0x000EC487]
Alas. Then allow me to grant you a hero's pay for a hero's service.

Id: [0x000EC581]
[Bayek gags] This food is rancid. It smells like shit. It's completely unfit for eating.

Id: [0x000EC582]
These bowls are filthy. What have the villagers been eating? They must have the food stored somewhere. I should have a look around.

Id: [0x000EC583]
There are no signs of a plague on the body.

Id: [0x000EC584]
These urns contain strong seasonings.

Id: [0x000EC59C]
Should one of us return to the fortress?

Id: [0x000EC59D]
No. You know what the plan is. Keep your eyes on that convoy, and get ready to spill blood.

Id: [0x000EC5A7]
Just waiting for the right moment. We could use an extra sword. Our gratitude goes a long way.

Id: [0x000EC5A9]
Great Serapis. Are you as merciful as Amun?

Id: [0x000EC5AB]
No wonder people are falling sick!

Id: [0x000EC5AC]
It is time we met this poisonous merchant.

Id: [0x000EC5C6]
Now!

Id: [0x000EC5C7]
Attack!

Id: [0x000EC5C8]
Aaahhh!

Id: [0x000EC5CA]
Break open that cage!

Id: [0x000EC5CE]
Slaughter every last one of these dogs!

Id: [0x000EC5CF]
Release me! I'll wet my blade with their blood!

Id: [0x000EC5D6]
M-my cart got stuck in a ditch far from town! As night came on, I heard terrible roars...

Id: [0x000EC5D9]
You should have killed me! Now, you die!

Id: [0x000EC5DC]
Thank you, Priest.

Id: [0x000EC5DD]
It is good to see Egyptians come back. Since my drummer was jailed, it has been... quiet.

Id: [0x000EC5DE]
A tanner jailed my drummer. Accused him of stealing a precious Nubian lion skin from the dye vats.

Id: [0x000EC629]
You! Yeah, big guy! You have got the look of a man who can heft things. Namely...me. And my injured foot.

Id: [0x000EC634]
You jest, surely? This is the best day of my life. My foot will cost that tanner!

Id: [0x000EC635]
What is it you think I can do?

Id: [0x000EC636]
Find the fools who stole it, of course. Return that skin and clear my name!

Id: [0x000EC639]
Surely your health is worth more than that.

Id: [0x000EC63A]
If I can prove nothing, you would be correct. That is where you come in, friend.

Id: [0x000EC660]
But you instead led them into a trap. Clever.

Id: [0x000EC661]
I knew my brothers would rescue me, but I did not know the Medjay from Siwa would be among them, too.

Id: [0x000EC668]
We will take shelter here and wait for the right moment to strike.

Id: [0x000EC675]
[cries stormily]

Id: [0x000EC67F]
Welcome, welcome to Letopolis! Dream of the great Taharqa.

Id: [0x000EC698]
Why do you weep? Your curse is lifted.

Id: [0x000EC69A]
Nor does a father's rage.

Id: [0x000EC69E]
And would you kindly bring a fertility talisman in blue faience?

Id: [0x000EC6B5]
Derratos is gone. Nek! He continues to elude me.

Id: [0x000EC6B7]
Let's be smart. We have an opportunity to claim two victories with one swift strike. We need to wait for Derratos to return to camp.

Id: [0x000EC6C0]
Bring the scribe here. We will take care of the rest.

Id: [0x000EC6D7]
You have lost a child, so you should understand that a mother's fear never ends.

Id: [0x000EC6E3]
This man is a thief!

Id: [0x000EC6E5]
I am going to sue you for my broken leg you neket iadet.

Id: [0x000EC6E6]
That is not helping.

Id: [0x000EC6E7]
I knew you Egyptians were all alike! This is what I get for hiring you! Thieves all!

Id: [0x000EC6E8]
I have my best man on this. We will fix it.

Id: [0x000EC6F3]
I will meet you on the road to the pyramids afterwards.

Id: [0x000EC703]
Then let us ride to the pyramid, and wait until the night unfurls in splendor.

Id: [0x000EC716]
Bloody footprints leading to the north.

Id: [0x000EC72C]
I see your cat is injured.

Id: [0x000EC72D]
It is not mine. Cats belong only to Bastet. I am only her instrument, defending her from Roman scum.

Id: [0x000EC730]
Bastet swung her fury through my arm. I am her servant!

Id: [0x000EC731]
I know a High Priestess who would love your… dedication. It would be best for you to serve Bastet at her temple in Bubastis.

Id: [0x000EC732]
I have served Bastet my entire life. To serve her better would be an honor. Lead on, brother.

Id: [0x000EC735]
We should keep our voices down. We don't need any untoward attention.

Id: [0x000EC738]
Cowards! Wonder what would happen if you battled a man and not a small creature?

Id: [0x000EC739]
Roman soldiers, terrified of our tiny little kittens.

Id: [0x000EC73B]
Egyptians! Rise up! Retake the city in the name of Bastet!

Id: [0x000EC73D]
Look at these girdle-wearers! It is like they think they are soldiers.

Id: [0x000EC73E]
Stay quiet!

Id: [0x000EC73F]
Will you be at peace?

Id: [0x000EC740]
Serapis save me.

Id: [0x000EC741]
Enough! We're almost through.

Id: [0x000EC77E]
Ready yourselves! Let's show these traitors they chose the wrong Pharaoh!

Id: [0x000EC77F]
A rain of fire! Order the shields!

Id: [0x000EC780]
I see ships bearing down fast!

Id: [0x000EC781]
We've got these [malakia](assholes)! Target their rear wings. They're full of oil! They'll burn like camel shit!

Id: [0x000EC782]
Call for ramming speed! Gut them like fish! Alalaaa!

Id: [0x000EC7BA]
It seems I'm not the first visitor today.

Id: [0x000EC7D8]
Who are you? What are you doing? Stay back or I'll jump! You aren't the first person to try and persuade me!

Id: [0x000EC7D9]
Easy. That is a long way down, even for me.

Id: [0x000EC7DA]
It doesn't matter. Nothing matters anymore. A scorpion took my husband's life. There's nothing left for me now.

Id: [0x000EC7DB]
Even bitter laughter is better than death. Why don't you step away from the ledge? We can talk.

Id: [0x000EC7E2]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000EC7E3]
A friend. Hold still and stay quiet. I will get you out of here.

Id: [0x000EC7F7]
This is for you.

Id: [0x000EC7F8]
A heron feather? Why?

Id: [0x000EC7F9]
It's a Siwan ritual. Feathers mean a lot to us. Anubis will weigh all our hearts when we die against Ma'at's white feather. Yours. Mine. Our loved ones…

Id: [0x000EC7FA]
I know what you're doing. This feather is for my afterlife.

Id: [0x000EC7FB]
You can thank me by showing me the way down.

Id: [0x000EC7FC]
You are Horus, are you not? Felix told me you're the trainer here.

Id: [0x000EC7FD]
Not my choice. Gallic brothers… hurt me. My head. Would have killed me if Felix did not stop them.

Id: [0x000EC7FE]
What can you tell me about them?

Id: [0x000EC7FF]
You don't want to fight them. They are strong and fast, and they like killing. For them, it's fun… sport.

Id: [0x000EC802]
Ah, the new Siwan fighter. I look forward to humiliating you in battle many times.

Id: [0x000EC803]
Eh. I joke, of course. We might be pitted against each other out there, but that's all the more reason to stand together in here.

Id: [0x000EC804]
I'm glad to hear it. But why does one of Ptolemy's soldiers risk his life in the Arena?

Id: [0x000EC807]
Have you ever challenged the brothers?

Id: [0x000EC80A]
I'm fine. But you have not yet told me how you came to be here.

Id: [0x000EC80F]
We are ready.

Id: [0x000EC810]
Are you? Everyone thinks they are ready till they get a fist in the face. I am starting you against a few novices. If you survive we will talk about more.

Id: [0x000EC813]
Are they screaming for our blood or for theirs?

Id: [0x000EC815]
You have taken to this new life easily.

Id: [0x000EC818]
And what then?

Id: [0x000EC81A]
The best gladiators are sent on special missions, and earn more coin than you can imagine.

Id: [0x000EC81B]
Then let us make sure they notice us!

Id: [0x000EC81D]
Any blood will do! No such thing as innocent here. Do not stay your blade, brother. They certainly will not! Every man here knows the risks!

Id: [0x000EC821]
Pairing you two toe stubbers was one of my best ideas. The crowd loves you!

Id: [0x000EC822]
I told you we were destined for greatness, Felix.

Id: [0x000EC825]
What do we need to do to face them?

Id: [0x000EC828]
Correspondence between Felix and someone who is not named about contracting gladiators. This might be The Crocodile.

Id: [0x000EC829]
He's complaining about the Gallic brothers not following orders recently. He wants to know if there are others available. This could work in my favour.

Id: [0x000EC83E]
Then that is what I will do. We are ready.

Id: [0x000EC83F]
Finally. They are asking about you two at the Arena in Cyrene. Put on a good show and we all profit.

Id: [0x000EC840]
The best way to reach the Crocodile is to beat the Gallic brothers. As if I needed more reason to slit the throats of Shadya's killers.

Id: [0x000EC841]
How often do you fight lions?

Id: [0x000EC842]
Only when Felix can get them! They are much more expensive than men volunteering for a beating!

Id: [0x000EC843]
There seems little honour in killing animals.

Id: [0x000EC844]
Kill or be eaten, Bayek! Besides, it's caged. We will be fine as long as we don't free it.

Id: [0x000EC84A]
Is that Kallistos? What happened?

Id: [0x000EC84B]
I warned him. He took a bad job. Just another blunt instrument for them to break against their enemies.

Id: [0x000EC84C]
Do you know who hired him?

Id: [0x000EC84D]
No. And Felix won't tell you. That's how this works. Some die. Some get rich. And everyone keeps quiet.

Id: [0x000EC84F]
Where's Kensa?

Id: [0x000EC850]
Her talents were required elsewhere today. You are going to have to win this one alone. You will be fine.

Id: [0x000EC851]
Another errand? Like the one that killed Kallistos?

Id: [0x000EC852]
Watch your tone, sword meat. What happened to Kallistos was... unfortunate. But he knew the risks.

Id: [0x000EC853]
Another errand for the unknown patron?

Id: [0x000EC854]
Fighters who ask too many questions do not survive. It is a dangerous job. Accidents happen.

Id: [0x000EC855]
I'm only keen to prove myself.

Id: [0x000EC856]
Then win this match. You will get your chance against the brothers. Beat them, and you will be noticed.

Id: [0x000EC858]
Is Kensa okay? Holy Anubis. I have to win this!

Id: [0x000EC85A]
Entire villages of people have disappeared in Psenhyris. There are rumours at the caravanserai that Demons have invaded. Demons? I've never seen one. I should check this out.

Id: [0x000EC85C]
So… your turn to fight the brothers. I won't say good luck. You won't get any. But listen to me.

Id: [0x000EC85D]
They are too strong together. That's how they beat me. Separate them. Fight one at a time and… maybe you live.

Id: [0x000EC85E]
Thank you, Horus. But don't worry. I am not dying today.

Id: [0x000EC863]
You have done well for a country corn rat. Your time has come. The crowd is bored with Viridovix and Diovicos destroying opponents with ease. I am counting on you to make this entertaining.

Id: [0x000EC864]
One more thing. Do not kill anyone! I want my top four fighters alive for rematches. I have given the Gauls the same order.

Id: [0x000EC865]
All right. We will not kill them. But no promises about pain and humiliation.

Id: [0x000EC866]
This is it, Bayek! Our big moment.

Id: [0x000EC869]
You are not afraid of heights, are you?

Id: [0x000EC86B]
Lead on little one. I will follow.

Id: [0x000EC86F]
If what Kensa says is true, any of the gladiators could be working for The Crocodile.

Id: [0x000EC870]
There might be evidence here of jobs the Gallic brothers did. Maybe even the identity of their patron.

Id: [0x000EC879]
Bayek, take a look around my ship before you go. I keep records of local problems which may have The Crocodile at their root. They may interest you, as a Medjay.

Id: [0x000EC87C]
Another of Shadya's dolls. Did Hotephres make this one too?

Id: [0x000EC87D]
Maps of settlements in the Faiyum, part of Khenut's work. Interesting, but not what I'm looking for.

Id: [0x000EC87E]
An unfinished letter to the Sobek priests. Scathing. Khenut and the Cult don't see eye to eye. Nothing else here.

Id: [0x000EC87F]
Complaints to Alexandria about the administration's practices in Faiyum, from Khenut. She didn't have much success. No ledger.

Id: [0x000EC881]
Servants tried to barricade the doors. They weren't quick enough.

Id: [0x000EC882]
It won't open. There's something blocking it on the other side.

Id: [0x000EC883]
There must be another way in.

Id: [0x000EC8C1]
What have we done? Gods! What have we done!

Id: [0x000EC8C2]
Easy brother. The Crocodile did this, not you or me. Surely… it must have been necessary.

Id: [0x000EC8C3]
Say that when the nightmares come! We watched and did nothing. We are not innocent.

Id: [0x000EC8C4]
Shadya...

Id: [0x000EC8E7]
Excuse me, what can you tell me about this place?

Id: [0x000EC8E8]
Can't you see? It's an arena for Roman blood sport. Barbaric if you ask me, but it's found favour with those desperate to forget their troubles.

Id: [0x000EC8E9]
It used to be a temple. It should have been left that way.

Id: [0x000EC8EB]
"Veridovix, the loyal servant of Death. His scythe will ever reap the unworthy."

Id: [0x000EC8F0]
What do you want with me!? I'm merely a scribe!

Id: [0x000EC8F1]
A scribe who knows his way around Karanis.

Id: [0x000EC8F2]
Derratos, where is he!?

Id: [0x000EC8F3]
That name means nothing to me!

Id: [0x000EC8F4]
Don't think us fools!

Id: [0x000EC8F5]
Please, stop!

Id: [0x000EC8F6]
Then talk!

Id: [0x000EC8FD]
Meet the others and wait for my arrival.

Id: [0x000EC8FE]
Your work here is done. We will get the information we need.

Id: [0x000EC908]
Ready your blades and check your arrows. Derratos will be back at the camp before sunrise.

Id: [0x000EC918]
There is no escaping now, Derratos. Face me!

Id: [0x000EC919]
Ha ha ha! This one knows me by name. Good!

Id: [0x000EC91A]
You don't remember, do you? Before this is over, you will. I have waited too long for this!

Id: [0x000EC931]
Go to the temple of Bastet. Only, I beg you, not to mention my name to the priestess.

Id: [0x000EC932]
I believe this is what the gods want you for.

Id: [0x000EC933]
If the gods will it, it will be done. Safe travels, Medjay. May Bastet watch over you.

Id: [0x000EC934]
I could, Medjay... But think of how a return to Alexandria might be served by the great warrior Khalid!

Id: [0x000EC93A]
I was captured by a scouting convoy and beaten into giving up our retreat point.

Id: [0x000EC95C]
That is him. Well done. We will find out what he knows.

Id: [0x000EC98B]
He's brought nothing but sorrow to my husband Aristo. The great poet-philosopher... jailed! Jailed for writing beautiful things!

Id: [0x000EC98E]
I worry about Aristo, I do. If you release him, make certain he gets safely away.

Id: [0x000EC99B]
This fire is dwindling...

Id: [0x000EC99C]
Then let it dwindle. We cannot take our eyes off that camp, no matter what.

Id: [0x000EC9C3]
Back off! You are a murderer!

Id: [0x000EC9D0]
A new life awaits you in the glorious city of Letopolis! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure!

Id: [0x000EC9D1]
Is it true forgotten secrets are discovered every day?

Id: [0x000ECA04]
[Meroui tchou em per-ankh ek, <LF>imi nekhenek n ounenek](How loved you are in your house of life,<LF>Your inner shrine of being)!

Id: [0x000ECA06]
Who are you!? One of Eudoros' phylakes?

Id: [0x000ECA07]
I am no friend of Eudoros'.

Id: [0x000ECA15]
My love spent years writing his masterwork. Years! Then Eudoros plagiarized it and passed my husband's genius off as his own!

Id: [0x000ECA16]
And Aristo took him to court?

Id: [0x000ECA17]
Months of arguments! In the end, my husband is beaten, ridiculed and tossed in a cage!

Id: [0x000ECA18]
Is this what passes for justice in Alexandria?

Id: [0x000ECA19]
Oh, my dear man, if you right this wrong, my husband and I can flee this city and be done with this ordeal.

Id: [0x000ECA1A]
The scribe is the key to learning Derratos' schedule. Go to Karanis and bring him to us.

Id: [0x000ECA21]
You have more courage than Achilles himself! You've released me from daily beatings!

Id: [0x000ECA22]
We should go quickly.

Id: [0x000ECA23]
The vlakos broke my hip. Be careful, I pray you!

Id: [0x000ECA24]
Your wife tells me to get you out of Alexandria.

Id: [0x000ECA25]
My wife! The dear woman. Yes, there's a boat in port. Take me there.

Id: [0x000ECA27]
Thank you, Bayek. Shame there are so few Medjay left. Your reputation precedes you.

Id: [0x000ECA2C]
That Eudoros! What a detestable man! He couldn't forgive me for writing a better book.

Id: [0x000ECA2D]
That's why Eudoros stole so much of my book! His own writing is insipid. He knows nothing of the Nile River! Couldn't describe a hippopotamus if it bit him on the ass.

Id: [0x000ECA2E]
It was a book about the Nile. Full of marvelous descriptions. I'm very good at descriptions, if I do say.

Id: [0x000ECA30]
The soldiers will certainly kill me if they find us. And what will become of my dear wife? She is the light of my life.

Id: [0x000ECA31]
She hated my book, though. "Too many crocodiles," she says. Which is a fair criticism.

Id: [0x000ECA33]
I should tell you, Eudoros is dead.

Id: [0x000ECA34]
Glad to hear it! May he roast in Hades for eternity.

Id: [0x000ECA37]
We made it!

Id: [0x000ECA3A]
You should leave, the Phylakitai will surely come after you.

Id: [0x000ECA3B]
I shall flee. My wife has booked us passage to Crete. It was always our plan to go there. Perhaps we will have a better life there.

Id: [0x000ECA3D]
He shall. He shall.

Id: [0x000ECA7C]
Oh my various Gods!! Senefer?!

Id: [0x000ECA7D]
Bayek!? Hooah man!!

Id: [0x000ECA7E]
Alright then. Let's do it

Id: [0x000ECA7F]
Can't wait to kick your ass professionally. LOL

Id: [0x000ECA80]
I gots me a Chariot.

Id: [0x000ECA81]
Sick. Feel like some practice? I could take around the Hippodrome to give you a feel for the track.

Id: [0x000ECA82]
Ugh. Looks like the bandits caught up but crossed some hyenas. Is Turo among the dead?

Id: [0x000ECA85]
At last. The ring Oba, Nebti and Rashidi were looking for.

Id: [0x000ECA86]
Give it to me! My Medjay, come on!

Id: [0x000ECA87]
It belongs to me.

Id: [0x000ECA88]
Give it to me!

Id: [0x000ECA89]
Greek garb...

Id: [0x000ECA8D]
You should go. There's nothing here!

Id: [0x000ECA8E]
Search Menkaure's pyramid.

Id: [0x000ECA92]
You brought Anta back!

Id: [0x000ECA93]
Will you come see us in Memphis?

Id: [0x000ECA94]
Anta's very happy that you saved her from those men.

Id: [0x000ECA95]
Are you coming to Memphis?

Id: [0x000ECA98]
Because of you, our family is together again.

Id: [0x000ECA99]
I hope you'll come see us in Memphis.

Id: [0x000ECA9E]
Come to Egypt. Map the pyramids. Get robbed within moments of setting foot into Giza.

Id: [0x000ECA9F]
We were all children once. I hold no grudges against these three.

Id: [0x000ECAA2]
There's a face I know.

Id: [0x000ECAA3]
Bayek! We learned your name from the others here! Have you seen Anta? She's running around here somewhere!

Id: [0x000ECAA4]
Lost again!?

Id: [0x000ECAA5]
No no! She loves the streets and knows them well. You should say hello!

Id: [0x000ECAA8]
Behaving, I hope...

Id: [0x000ECAA9]
The Bandit Slayer!

Id: [0x000ECAAA]
Is that my new title?

Id: [0x000ECAAB]
Hero of Giza? The Great Medjay.

Id: [0x000ECAAC]
(laughs) Sounds better.

Id: [0x000ECAAD]
Oh...I already told everyone you're The Bandit Slayer...

Id: [0x000ECAAE]
Then that will do. Good to see you again.

Id: [0x000ECAB1]
Keeping out of trouble?

Id: [0x000ECAB2]
You've come to see us!

Id: [0x000ECAB3]
I see Corteseos held his end of your agreement.

Id: [0x000ECAB4]
He left some time ago. Have you seen the others? Things are just like they used to be!

Id: [0x000ECAB5]
I'm glad to hear it.

Id: [0x000ECAB6]
Come back anytime, we will always be here!

Id: [0x000ECB5D]
Hey Castor, I found an entrance!

Id: [0x000ECB5E]
Coming!

Id: [0x000ECB5F]
Wow Bayek, do you feel the weight of the centuries?

Id: [0x000ECB60]
Oh gods why have you forsaken me?

Id: [0x000ECB61]
Isn't there anyone to help me?

Id: [0x000ECB62]
Wow! Bayek, come see this!

Id: [0x000ECB63]
It is beautiful.

Id: [0x000ECB64]
And also the weight of the darkness. Can you help with lighting this place up? I forgot to bring a torch.

Id: [0x000ECB65]
Give me a minute.

Id: [0x000ECB66]
Oh Bayek I've been attacked by a creature of Hades! It came out of the dark and crushed into me!

Id: [0x000ECB67]
I was so excited to enter the shrine that I didn't have a thought for being careful.

Id: [0x000ECB68]
I couldn't pace a hēmipodion before I heard the beast roaring...

Id: [0x000ECB69]
And then I was on the ground, without my pouch!

Id: [0x000ECB6A]
Castor, stay here. I will bring you your pouch back.

Id: [0x000ECB6B]
Hey Castor! It's safe now, you can come!

Id: [0x000ECB6C]
Did you find it Bayek?

Id: [0x000ECB6D]
It was... a goat, Castor.

Id: [0x000ECB6E]
Oh.

Id: [0x000ECB6F]
Here is your pouch.

Id: [0x000ECB70]
Than you, Bayek, my book is in here.

Id: [0x000ECB71]
I cannot imagine what would have I done without it.

Id: [0x000ECB72]
Now, let's check this shrine out.

Id: [0x000ECB73]
The ancient Berbers believed the Atlas mountain was alive...

Id: [0x000ECB74]
And as you maybe know, we Greeks also believe in Atlas.

Id: [0x000ECB75]
He is the Titan that holds the world together!

Id: [0x000ECB76]
Must be hard, yes.

Id: [0x000ECB77]
A difficult proffesion, if you ask me.

Id: [0x000ECB78]
I will stay and draw a picture of this shrine.

Id: [0x000ECB79]
In a day, I will go to the next shrine - the one of the Earth Shaker!

Id: [0x000ECB7A]
You can meet me at the entrance in a day.

Id: [0x000ECB7B]
I kind of expect something to happen now.

Id: [0x000ECB7C]
To be honest Castor, I wouldn't be surprised at all.

Id: [0x000ECB7D]
Did you hear that? Oh wait it's my stomach... I think I am hungry.

Id: [0x000ECB7E]
Never mind. Do you guess who this shrine is built for?

Id: [0x000ECB7F]
Yes! Poseidon! Isn't it beautiful?

Id: [0x000ECB80]
This is a grandiose place. Poseidon has been known to Greeks as the fierce god of the ocean.

Id: [0x000ECB81]
I agree with the Greeks - look at what happened to the bandits who tried to plunder his shrine.

Id: [0x000ECB82]
You are right again, Bayek. Maybe I shouldn't stay too long... But I need to describe this for my book!

Id: [0x000ECB83]
Bayek, I will go next to the lair of the Amazon Queen! You can meet me in a day!

Id: [0x000ECB84]
Hello? Bayek, is this you?

Id: [0x000ECB85]
Thank the gods, it IS you!

Id: [0x000ECB86]
Please help me - I thought this was the way but I was wrong...

Id: [0x000ECB87]
As soon as I saw what a narrow hole the entrance is I got a painful reminder... of the shrine of Amun!

Id: [0x000ECB88]
And on top of that I forgot to tie the boat and it drifted away.

Id: [0x000ECB89]
I was hopeless but you show up as my deus ex machina!

Id: [0x000ECB8A]
Oh, you can have the honor. Put the statue on the pedestal!

Id: [0x000ECB8B]
Castor, how old are you?

Id: [0x000ECB8C]
30, why?

Id: [0x000ECB8D]
I wonder is it luck or the help of the gods that you are still amongst the living.

Id: [0x000ECB8E]
Maye the bandits tried to leave with their treasure, but were wrecked on the rocks when a storm hit?

Id: [0x000ECB8F]
Did you see the ship wrecks by the cave entrance?

Id: [0x000ECB90]
Was anything under the water?

Id: [0x000ECB91]
There was a man murdered, shot down with arrows.

Id: [0x000ECB92]
Seems like they fought.

Id: [0x000ECB93]
The bandits fought here. Over treasure?

Id: [0x000ECB94]
Maybe someone tried to steal it?

Id: [0x000ECB95]
It looks like there was something here a long time ago.

Id: [0x000ECB96]
Maybe someone used an urn to move the remains.

Id: [0x000ECB97]
But how did they manage to go through this tiny hole?

Id: [0x000ECB98]
Maybe it wasn't tiny back then - looks like it has collapsed.

Id: [0x000ECB99]
There are marks from dragging on the floor here.

Id: [0x000ECB9A]
A shipwreck?

Id: [0x000ECB9B]
Must have come from a broken arrow.

Id: [0x000ECB9C]
Doesn't surprise me... these animals.

Id: [0x000ECB9D]
Just a fish who got washed up into the cave.

Id: [0x000ECB9E]
Bayek... this looks like a big fish... Do you think there could be more?

Id: [0x000ECB9F]
Are you afraid of fish, Castor?

Id: [0x000ECBA0]
* Gulps audibly * Don't be ridiculous.

Id: [0x000ECBA1]
Broken pots, nothing significant.

Id: [0x000ECBA2]
Yes, nothing significant for you! They've destroyed ancient art, Bayek!

Id: [0x000ECBA3]
Show some respect for history!

Id: [0x000ECBA8]
Oh, you brought the boat! Let's go inside Bayek!

Id: [0x000ECBA9]
Cannot wait to find out who is this shrine built for!

Id: [0x000ECBAA]
Wait...

Id: [0x000ECBAB]
There's nothing on this pedestal. I think something happened recently...

Id: [0x000ECBAC]
It seems like there was something on this pedestal - maybe a statue.

Id: [0x000ECBAD]
Let's try to find it!

Id: [0x000ECBAE]
I should check the water, maybe the ship the bandits tried to escape on sank?

Id: [0x000ECBAF]
Here is your things, Castor.

Id: [0x000ECBB0]
All right! They didn't burn the book! I am so happy right now Bayek!

Id: [0x000ECBB1]
Let's get out of here.

Id: [0x000ECBB2]
But I still haven't seen the shrine.

Id: [0x000ECBB3]
Look. I will go very quietly and sketch the place quickly.

Id: [0x000ECBB4]
I know it is too much to ask of you, so you can go home.

Id: [0x000ECBB5]
After all, the ad didn't say that you will be put against deadly threats like bandits.

Id: [0x000ECBB6]
Castor, do you think I will leave you like that?

Id: [0x000ECBB7]
Just... let's be quick. And I too want to see the shrine.

Id: [0x000ECBB8]
Bayek! I knew you would save me yet again!

Id: [0x000ECBB9]
These filthy animals have desecrated this beautiful shrine!

Id: [0x000ECBBA]
They are certain there is even more treasure than they have already found here so they are destroying the place.

Id: [0x000ECBBB]
They took all of my belongings! My book is in danger.

Id: [0x000ECBBC]
Let's go get it and get out of here.

Id: [0x000ECBBD]
Hmm. Here is his camp, but he's gone.

Id: [0x000ECBBE]
I need to find him, he might be... He IS in trouble for sure.

Id: [0x000ECBD4]
I escaped Anubis. I looked the demons in their black and burning eyes. Then the gods danced me from my shackles! Ha-ha!

Id: [0x000ECBD6]
What happened to you?

Id: [0x000ECBD7]
We were all attacked by Demons. They took the boy.

Id: [0x000ECBD8]
What boy? Why didn't anyone stop them?

Id: [0x000ECBD9]
I tried… I'm just a farmer, no warrior. The boy was mad! He thought he could fight the demons. He's just a boy, at the broken tower. I ran away. I'm... (sobbing)

Id: [0x000ECBDB]
Everyone is gone! The monsters took them while we farmed. Gods! Save us!

Id: [0x000ECBDC]
I saw the beasts with my own eyes! Demons! Twenty hands tall, with cruel forked tongues and black skin. Their eyes... burned me...

Id: [0x000ECBDD]
Minons of Set! You cannot stop them! They will be here soon. They are coming. They are coming... (sob)

Id: [0x000ECBDE]
So it was Berenike. She is the Crocodile. She is the one who killed Shadya. She is the one who has brought ruin to so many.

Id: [0x000ECBDF]
She calls herself the sponsor of Faiyum's prosperity and culture, and her influence is felt throughout the region.

Id: [0x000ECBE1]
Then that is where I will find her. Thank you for everything, my friend. What will you do now?

Id: [0x000ECBE2]
I will retire to our family villa. I need a drink. Khenut and I must mourn in peace.

Id: [0x000ECBE3]
Farewell, Bayek. Once you have done what you must, we would be glad to see you again.

Id: [0x000ECBE8]
I'm sorry it had to end this way, old friend. May you find peace in Ma'at's embrace.

Id: [0x000ECBE9]
There's the granary Hotephres spoke of. The Crocodile must be inside.

Id: [0x000ECBEC]
Boy, what are you doing out here alone?

Id: [0x000ECBED]
My business is my own. Why is a protector coming here?

Id: [0x000ECBEE]
There are rumors of disappearing villagers, demons, and a missing boy.

Id: [0x000ECBEF]
Our village did not disappear! We were taken by bandits. I'm the only one left. But I am going back to save my father.

Id: [0x000ECBF4]
Sandstorm. We must face it straight on.

Id: [0x000ECBF5]
I don't have the time to wait.

Id: [0x000ECBF6]
Your father... are you certain he lives?

Id: [0x000ECBF7]
No, but I have to try. My mother passed many floods ago. I do not remember her. My father raised me alone.

Id: [0x000ECBF8]
If he lives, I will save him. If he does not, I will honor him with my death. And we will ride through the Field of Reeds together.

Id: [0x000ECC3C]
Did he tell us anything of value?

Id: [0x000ECC3D]
No, my lady.

Id: [0x000ECC3E]
A pity. Dispose of the body, along with the others. Tear his heart out. As instructed by the Order.

Id: [0x000ECC72]
Hah! Many lost works and fragments of the old world are found here. Perhaps not every day, but often enough to make us wonder.

Id: [0x000ECC75]
Welcome, Nebet! The city of Egypt's future welcomes all!

Id: [0x000ECC77]
Come, Neb, are you ready to work to free yourself? Join us, and take a house as your reward!

Id: [0x000ECC7D]
Roars? There are no large beasts in this region.

Id: [0x000ECC8A]
Bayek! You found Khufu and Chiera! Today I cry tears of joy!

Id: [0x000ECC8D]
Show me.

Id: [0x000ECCA6]
I am the Master of Secret Things, the form of the soul that rests in the heavens...

Id: [0x000ECCA7]
I am Servant to the Great God, who gives light exceedingly...

Id: [0x000ECCA8]
I am the Companion of the Flame, in whose mouth the fire is not quenched.

Id: [0x000ECCAD]
Hello Big boy, looking for a good time? No? Shame.

Id: [0x000ECCAE]
Vesta? Name rings a bell; I've not worked here that long though.

Id: [0x000ECCAF]
I've seen Hesiod around here. Not for a while though. I used to be his favorite, he must have found someone else who liked his depravity more.

Id: [0x000ECCB0]
Vesta? I think that's the new girl. Keeps herself to herself, but I saw her going into a house by the South Gate.

Id: [0x000ECCCC]
My child lives!

Id: [0x000ECD2D]
Flee!

Id: [0x000ECD2E]
The gods have entrusted me with your demise.

Id: [0x000ECD2F]
Surround them!

Id: [0x000ECD30]
They come for Ptolemy! Save our King!

Id: [0x000ECD32]
You! You are but a gnat in our great plan!

Id: [0x000ECD33]
Oh, how I wish you could see yourself from such an angle, Bayek.

Id: [0x000ECD34]
Meet Yugr Tn. She wishes to make your acquaintance!

Id: [0x000ECD35]
Come, Yugr Tn! Charge!

Id: [0x000ECD48]
Old writings. I have no idea what they say, but it scares me in my bones.

Id: [0x000ECD4B]
All r-right. What should I do? I don't know if I c-c-can sleep here!

Id: [0x000ECD4C]
You will be fine.

Id: [0x000ECD4F]
I've seen that dour face before. You've come for your house!

Id: [0x000ECD50]
No, I-

Id: [0x000ECD59]
May I look?

Id: [0x000ECD5A]
Sure. Go on and take a look.

Id: [0x000ECD5B]
Yes. I thought they were kind of creepy. I think someone else may have found the same thing.

Id: [0x000ECD5F]
Looks like the same style. Perhaps part of the same message.

Id: [0x000ECD65]
Are you new here?

Id: [0x000ECD66]
Passing through. But looking into a mystery. Did you find ancient hieroglyphs in your house?

Id: [0x000ECD67]
Didn't everyone? Didn't worry me much. Why, does it mean something?

Id: [0x000ECD68]
Not sure yet. May I look?

Id: [0x000ECD69]
Don't see why not. Tell me if I should worry!

Id: [0x000ECD6C]
Another part of the message.

Id: [0x000ECD6F]
Hmm? Yes, what?

Id: [0x000ECD70]
Nehi found a strange symbol in his house, like you. May I take a look?

Id: [0x000ECD71]
Certainly. He's new, yes? He'd be cute if he didn't look like he was always about to cry.

Id: [0x000ECD73]
Tell him I asked how he was. My name's Nebefer.

Id: [0x000ECD74]
May I ask you something?

Id: [0x000ECD77]
More of the message.

Id: [0x000ECD87]
My lady needs parts from fresh-killed sacred birds.

Id: [0x000ECD9E]
It appears to be a prophetic vision.

Id: [0x000ECDB2]
These priests made an invocation for protection to the One Before Whom Evil Trembles.

Id: [0x000ECDB3]
In drinking their concoction, they gave their lives, as well as their city, to Sekhmet.

Id: [0x000ECDB4]
Letopolis was sacrificed to the gods by the ancients so the rest of the Nile could be granted to the realm of men.

Id: [0x000ED9B9]
You will find Mother in the Field of Reeds without it. I promise.

Id: [0x000EF173]
The demons... have taken my eyes, but they could not take my son. You saved me, Rahotep.

Id: [0x000EF1E6]
A ruined tower? I cannot leave a boy alone in the desert. I must find him.

Id: [0x000EF225]
Hotephres! Nek, he's not here. I need to find out where my informant is.

Id: [0x000EF267]
Feastday breads! Fresh feastday breads!

Id: [0x000EF268]
Breads in all shapes and sizes! Bread in the shape of the Double Crown!

Id: [0x000EF26A]
I don't believe so.

Id: [0x000EF26B]
Another cur who made brief mention of me in his verse.

Id: [0x000EF29F]
I curse Ahmes the fruit-seller, eater of his own shit.

Id: [0x000EF2A0]
The finest bread in Memphis! Favorite bakery of Cleopatra, the Queen!

Id: [0x000EF2A1]
May the life and mind and memory of Ahmes the fruit-seller be forgotten.

Id: [0x000EF2A2]
Coriander-seed bread! Date bread! Two loaves for the price of one on feastdays!

Id: [0x000EF2A3]
May the liver and lungs and stomach of Ahmes the fruit-seller putrefy into ash.

Id: [0x000EF2A4]
Feastday breads! Buy a fresh loaf for your sweetheart!

Id: [0x000EF2A5]
May Ahmes the fruit-seller's ka be deprived of nourishment in the grave.

Id: [0x000EF2A6]
Brighten your children's eyes with bread in the shape of a fish!

Id: [0x000EF2A8]
Since I cannot recite while I sleep, I do it while I work.

Id: [0x000EF2A9]
What happened to your taster?

Id: [0x000EF2B0]
Gods blast the regime! They arrested him for not paying the tax on spices! And now I am out of cinnamon!

Id: [0x000EF2E2]
The Lady of Slaughter. This place was dedicated to Sekhmet, then. I thought Letopolis was home to Horus.

Id: [0x000EF2E4]
Hm. A prayer.

Id: [0x000EF300]
Can you walk?

Id: [0x000EF301]
[groan]

Id: [0x000EF302]
I can see that. You did not pay your taxes.

Id: [0x000EF376]
Baba! Ipuy!

Id: [0x000EF383]
Who's there? I am armed! I will hurt you so much the gods will sing stories of how badly for ages!

Id: [0x000EF384]
Keep the peace, friend. I am merely curious.

Id: [0x000EF385]
There is little enough left of value. The jackals have already stripped this site clean!

Id: [0x000EF386]
I read about an ancient battle, between Maahes and Ochus, and wondered if it was here.

Id: [0x000EF387]
Do you know what became of Maahes sword?

Id: [0x000EF388]
The Sword of Ptah? Said to be sacred to both Sekhmet and Serqet? No, but as I said, this place has long been plundered. The bandits stay north of here, so I stay far away.

Id: [0x000EF389]
A history of the lost keepers of this place.

Id: [0x000EF38A]
You may have read my version of [Ma'ani-Djehuti]("I have seen Thoth")? No? No matter.

Id: [0x000EF39B]
Thank you dearest goddesses. I will use this to keep the faith.

Id: [0x000EF39F]
A basket of cakes. I got here in time.

My life was undone here. Yet now there is a shrine, a memorial where none should be.

Id: [0x000EF48C]
The bent tomb of Sneferu.

Id: [0x000EF48E]
This room...

Id: [0x000EF492]
That is the last torch. I should return to Nefertari.

Id: [0x000EF935]
These flower aren't from around here. Expensive. ...and still fresh.

Id: [0x000EF936]
Almost every piece is gold plated. Icarus must have benn loaded!

Id: [0x000EF937]
This connection has been weakened. like its been... sawed through

Id: [0x000EF949]
I am too weak even to stand!

Id: [0x000EF981]
Bayek! How long has it been? A decade? More?

Id: [0x000EF982]
You left Siwa a long time ago. And you left your name behind too.

Id: [0x000EF983]
I had to. Claridas is a name better suited for the Hippodrome.

Id: [0x000EF985]
Remember the horses we rode outside Siwa?

Id: [0x000EF9B5]
My cart is being held in a quarry to the south

Id: [0x000EF9BE]
Khaliset lives in a cave in the hills just east of here.

Id: [0x000EF9BF]
Meet me at the ruins by Khufu and Khafre once you find Khaliset's object.

Id: [0x000EF9C2]
The pyramids, what kind of sinister plot awaits me there? This uncertainty troubles me.

Id: [0x000EF9D1]
Gor you, Sucka!! You're under arrest

Id: [0x000EF9D2]
I regret nothing!!!

Id: [0x000EF9E0]
You there!

Id: [0x000EF9E1]
I have some questions for you. I understand you may know something about that wreck over there...

Id: [0x000EF9E2]
I was paid to sabotage the chariot, but I couldnt go through with it. I should have said something. 

Id: [0x000EF9E3]
Who paid you? 

Id: [0x000EF9E4]
I've never seen him, but my guess is the  Blue Team leader would have arranged it. He look like a noble servant. Try the Big Blue House. 

Id: [0x000EFA20]
Help me, and I will end this.

Id: [0x000EFA22]
Mered was telling the truth, but no sign of Khaliset. I should look around

Id: [0x000EFAC7]
There are bandits all around here. I'll start there.

Id: [0x000EFACE]
Bandits got a hold of him. Like Oba. I will tell you a secret though. I do not trust either of them with the ring.

Id: [0x000EFB46]
Huh? You know my name?

Id: [0x000EFB48]
Those nags? Hah! Never thought you would leave that shithole.

Id: [0x000EFB5C]
Ah, Siwa. Small, poor, and ugly. The only beauty there was Aya. Has it changed much? Has she?

Id: [0x000EFB5D]
Things change. People change.

Id: [0x000EFB5E]
Haha... Bayek, come. Let me show you something inspiring, ah?

Id: [0x000EFB60]
Leave him alone, Nikias. Hehe. Real men are drinking here tonight!

Id: [0x000EFB7F]
Thank you for rescuing me

Id: [0x000EFB80]
What Happened?

Id: [0x000EFB81]
One of my student ran away today

Id: [0x000EFB82]
it might have been my fault i think my teaching got him really excited about Alexander the great.

Id: [0x000EFB83]
I suspect he went to Alexander's temple or the chasm. Bayek i have to find him before something bad happen and you have to help me

Id: [0x000EFB84]
I will help you find him. I will go to the temple and you go to the chasm.

Id: [0x000EFB89]
Someone went through here recently

Id: [0x000EFBA1]
This must be Mered's cart

Id: [0x000EFBA2]
Mered will not be happy about this

Id: [0x000EFBA6]
I saw you ride last month when five chariots all crashed at the turn!

Id: [0x000EFBA7]
Yes, that was an amazing race.

Id: [0x000EFBA8]
Your horses look so strong, so sleek. How do you choose them?

Id: [0x000EFBA9]
(laughs) I have an eye for flesh.

Id: [0x000EFBAA]
[giggles]

Id: [0x000EFBAB]
Can I buy you a drink?

Id: [0x000EFBAC]
Any time! Fetch a fresh round!

Id: [0x000EFBB4]
Keep looking. I'm sure it'll pop up somewhere.

Id: [0x000EFBB9]
I am keeping far away from the others, and when I find that ring, I will go even further!

Id: [0x000EFBBA]
You better hurry. They might find it before you do.

Id: [0x000EFBBB]
No! I will not let that happen! It is mine!

Id: [0x000EFBBC]
Shh, the ring is still missing but I think it is somewhere close by!

Id: [0x000EFBBD]
I think the others found it.

Id: [0x000EFBBE]
They have not... Have they? Have they!? Gah! You are playing tricks on me.

Id: [0x000EFBC5]
The maidservant said they want its tongue.

Id: [0x000EFBCA]
(gasp)

Id: [0x000EFBCD]
I will take a few feathers for Taimhotep's ritual.

Id: [0x000EFBD0]
Taimhotep needs its beak.

Id: [0x000EFBD1]
Your brother has told me of your troubles.

Id: [0x000EFBD2]
Oh. Are you angry?

Id: [0x000EFBD5]
I know what happened to Anta. I will see to bringing her home.

Id: [0x000EFBD6]
Really!? I thought you were one of them!

Id: [0x000EFBD9]
Did you bring me here to get rid of these bandits?

Id: [0x000EFBDA]
I don't work for them! This mean old lady locked up a bunch of us kids. She makes us steal for her.

Id: [0x000EFBDB]
How did a smart boy like you get tricked into working for bandits?

Id: [0x000EFBDD]
Do you want us to help you out with the horseman?

Id: [0x000EFBDF]
If we don't do anything, the horseman will come for Anta again.

Id: [0x000EFBE2]
We need to protect Anta! She's a god! Her barks are more fierce than words!

Id: [0x000EFBE6]
Are you not sad? Your friends have died.

Id: [0x000EFC0D]
That ship will not sail any time soon.

Id: [0x000F0908]
Whoever owns this ship was responsible for the kidnappings.

Id: [0x000F0914]
A child hiding. And there's that colorful sail.

Id: [0x000F0916]
The bandits won't stop looking for me! I can't get away!

Id: [0x000F0925]
I'm looking for Information on the kidnapping of a Blue Driver

Id: [0x000F0926]
What makes you think we had something to do with it?

Id: [0x000F0927]
Dont play dumb. Some of you have been harrasing him at his home. 

Id: [0x000F0928]
Tough words, buddy boy. I told you we dont know anything. 

Id: [0x000F0929]
Those psychotic Green Hooligans went too far this time!! Look at this place. 

Id: [0x000F092A]
Fanaticism can be intense. Especially around here. 

Id: [0x000F092B]
Worst of all, they chucked my  first trophy in the water.

Id: [0x000F092C]
Relax - I'll find it. 

Id: [0x000F092D]
They came out of nowhere! Where....where is my brother!?!

Id: [0x000F092E]
The Hoolilgans again? Where would they have taken him?

Id: [0x000F092F]
No idea. I'd start with the Green Club house though. They all congregate there. 

Id: [0x000F0930]
I'll get him back. Stay here. 

Id: [0x000F0931]
Its you! That man from before! Thank you so much! I cant believe you came!

Id: [0x000F0932]
Fans are crazy around here. 

Id: [0x000F0933]
Could I impose on you to help me back, they beat me pretty bad

Id: [0x000F0934]
Sure. Let's go 

Id: [0x000F0935]
Here we are

Id: [0x000F0936]
Wonderful! Thanks again, friend. 

Id: [0x000F0937]
Be well.

Id: [0x000F093A]
Guards! An interloper has boarded my ship!

Id: [0x000F0941]
Keep your distance!

Id: [0x000F0943]
My men will gut you if you damage my smallest fingernail!

Id: [0x000F0945]
I will make sacrifice to you, Pluto, if you spare me! Dates, figs -- a black pig!

Id: [0x000F0948]
[Psst!] Over here!

Id: [0x000F094A]
Open this door! One of those piss-reeking bandits has the key.

Id: [0x000F094C]
Come here and let us out!

Id: [0x000F0954]
I'm going to track down that Roman bitch who did this to my family.

Id: [0x000F0956]
If you want to help me kill her, meet me at the House of Nef.

Id: [0x000F09B8]
I have passed many prosperous farms. People here seem to be doing well. Why are there so many poor?

Id: [0x000F09B9]
Ah yes. Those are Greek farms. The Greeks pay lower taxes, so they prosper. Meanwhile, the Egyptian farmers are slowly forced from their lands.

Id: [0x000F09BA]
What happens to the land when the farmers leave?

Id: [0x000F09BB]
Once the owners die, by law the land is freed. If it's good land, the Greeks take it. If not, the desert takes it. Either way, Egyptians are left to starve. Many end up in the slums.

Id: [0x000F1D83]
Has that business with the farm been finished yet?

Id: [0x000F1D85]
That farm should be mine by now! What is behind the delay?

Id: [0x000F1D86]
What were we talking about?

Id: [0x000F1D87]
How you got here.

Id: [0x000F1DEA]
Anta...

Id: [0x000F1DED]
Such speed!

Id: [0x000F1DF6]
I'm sure the gods will bless Prasina Green in their favored arena!

Id: [0x000F1E68]
A sistrum

Id: [0x000F1E69]
Osiris, god of the underworld, protector of the dead. These were drawn hurriedly, desperately

Id: [0x000F1E6A]
Effigies of Hathor, the feathers of Mut, both goddesses of motherhood. Scattered silica. She was conducting rituals here

Id: [0x000F1E6B]
"From ashes to seeds."

Id: [0x000F1E6C]
This pillar speaks of rebirth. Revival

Id: [0x000F1E6D]
Who would be buried down here?

Id: [0x000F1E70]
The Veneta Blues who gnashed their teeth and tore their breasts when he beat them, even they weep bitter tears at his loss.

Id: [0x000F1E74]
Praise to the gods.

Id: [0x000F1E88]
We won't let you down, father!

Id: [0x000F1F5A]
Come by later if you want to help kill that cankered harpy.

Id: [0x000F1F5E]
I hope the dogs in the street like the taste of Roman flesh.

Id: [0x000F1FB9]
And all you wanted was Aya and little Bayeks. What made you abandon your dr-

Id: [0x000F1FBA]
Enough!

Id: [0x000F1FC3]
I hope you race wearing the green, Baret.

Id: [0x000F1FC4]
I... I will do my best.

Id: [0x000F1FCB]
I wonder how Hotephres and Khenut are. I should visit them.

Id: [0x000F1FCC]
My friend, you came. I am glad.

Id: [0x000F1FCD]
Who is this? Where is Khenut?

Id: [0x000F1FCE]
My wife is… wherever she goes. Withdrawn and cold. This is… yesterday. She was just leaving.

Id: [0x000F1FCF]
Khenut is probably down at the lake. I will take you to her. Let me know when you are ready to go.

Id: [0x000F1FD2]
Hotephres, what is this? What are you doing? You will lose everything.

Id: [0x000F1FD3]
I know, I know. I am useless to anyone right now.

Id: [0x000F1FD4]
I hung up my sword years ago. I only got involved because Apollodorus practically demanded it. He thought us all threatened by some grave conspiracy. Now Shadya's dead.

Id: [0x000F1FD5]
Something big is happening. You were right to try to help.

Id: [0x000F1FD6]
I was stupid! I did not want to do it. Khenut insisted, said it was our duty. If I had not listened to her Shadya would still live.

Id: [0x000F1FD8]
She will be up ahead. We built a shrine by the water. Shadya loves the water. We feed the fish before supper.

Id: [0x000F1FDA]
Khenut. It is good to see you... Khenut?

Id: [0x000F1FDB]
This is how she is now.

Id: [0x000F1FDC]
There's something that might help. In Siwa, we have a ritual to mark a loved one's passing. Would you mind?

Id: [0x000F1FDD]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x000F1FDE]
The ritual requires something. I will return shortly.

Id: [0x000F1FDF]
I should leave them to grieve.

Id: [0x000F1FE0]
I need a feather for the ritual. There are marshlands nearby. I will find birds there.

Id: [0x000F1FE1]
I have what I need.

Id: [0x000F1FF0]
Thank the gods! Hurry, we have to leave before he comes back.

Id: [0x000F1FF2]
Who? What is happening here?

Id: [0x000F1FF3]
The Embalmer. He's throwing people to crocodiles. His guests watch as they're ripped apart.

Id: [0x000F1FF4]
Be calm. You are safe. Where is he now?

Id: [0x000F1FF5]
Seni, forgive me, I overheard you just now. You said something about a Man-Beast.

Id: [0x000F1FF6]
The Man-Beast has been taking people from here for months.

Id: [0x000F1FF8]
The Phylakitai are useless. Just last week, three fishermen disappeared. Bits of them floated in a few days later. They did nothing.

Id: [0x000F1FFB]
I don't want you playing with him. The Man-Beast lives there! Do you want to be cut in pieces? Now come away!

Id: [0x000F1FFE]
I don't want to hear it! Another show is filling up, and we're low on bait. Find me some more!

Id: [0x000F2002]
More blood in the water. It seems to be coming from that cave. By Amun, what is going on?

Id: [0x000F200A]
My friend. Could I speak with you?

Id: [0x000F200B]
I. Am. Not. Your. Friend.

Id: [0x000F200C]
Go away from here!

Id: [0x000F2014]
This is my toy Sobek. See? He carries his babies in his mouth. Father made it for me.

Id: [0x000F2016]
Can you tell my friends to come back and play? Sobek didn't really eat the people in the river. It's just a game.

Id: [0x000F2018]
Anything taken by the current ends up here.

Id: [0x000F2019]
Flesh. It is rotting and waterlogged, and hard to identify. It's come here from upstream.

Id: [0x000F201A]
There is meat in the baskets for feeding the fish. Gods, that could be human.

Id: [0x000F201B]
This place is a damned slaughter yard! But I can't tell if the flesh is human.

Id: [0x000F201C]
It is floating here from somewhere further upstream.

Id: [0x000F2022]
Amun! So many corpses, all half eaten. Argh, the stench!

Id: [0x000F2023]
Cushions and luxury. These look like seats for some kind of theater.

Id: [0x000F2024]
Good wine, and refreshments. Whoever sat here was well pampered.

Id: [0x000F2025]
Nek! More body parts! Where are they all coming from?

Id: [0x000F2026]
This ruined felucca has been here a long time. The body parts are more recent.

Id: [0x000F2028]
I should continue upstream and find the source.

Id: [0x000F2029]
Such extravagance. This Embalmer is making a lot of money.

Id: [0x000F202A]
Nek! This embalmer is sick!

Id: [0x000F202C]
Now I embalm you with death.

Id: [0x000F2036]
Why did we not just kill that Egyptian cow?

Id: [0x000F2037]
Oh, don't worry. The commander has got something special planned for her. I know her type, proud and defiant. Thinks she's untouchable.

Id: [0x000F2038]
See how proud she is when we remove her tongue.

Id: [0x000F2039]
We'll come back tonight and gut her quietly. What do you think? (Laughs)

Id: [0x000F203D]
An insignia! I do not recognize this. Maybe Hotephres knows more.

Id: [0x000F203E]
He will not be missed, but he spoke of a commander. Someone else is giving the orders. This is not over.

Id: [0x000F2048]
You have only just met me. Yet I have answered all your questions truthfully.

Id: [0x000F2049]
I am going to save my father. You have no duty here. You cannot forbid me anything. I am not your son.

Id: [0x000F204A]
Rahotep, my son was like you. He also fought a man's battle, and died doing it. Would you stay hidden?

Id: [0x000F204B]
All right, Bayek. I will listen to you in this. But if you fall, I will take your place.

Id: [0x000F204C]
See the lookout tower there? The guards, from time to time, abandon their post to piss. We can pass through then.

Id: [0x000F204E]
You have an eye for strategy. Your father should be proud. Now keep to the shadows, and wait.

Id: [0x000F2053]
Where is it? They said it would be here!

Id: [0x000F2067]
Neb, what can you tell me about the men who fight here?

Id: [0x000F2068]
Men? These are not men, they're gods! You've never seen such savage warriors. They could break you in half with one strike.

Id: [0x000F2069]
Gods among gods, have you never heard of the brothers from Gaul? Can't you feel their eyes on you? Their statues are beside me!

Id: [0x000F2082]
A med what? I do not even care. Can you fight? You look the part, like a vicious… mangy dog. [spits]

Id: [0x000F2083]
I only want entry to the Arena. I heard you've got a fighter worth watching. With red hair.

Id: [0x000F2088]
"Diovicos, the living embodiment of War. His fists are deadlier than any weapon."

Id: [0x000F208D]
We need to clean this place up and get it running again.

Id: [0x000F208E]
Don't worry. I won't let them close down this kitchen.

Id: [0x000F2093]
A lot of damage, but no blood or signs of a fight. Maybe he fled before this happened?

Id: [0x000F2094]
Who would have done such a thing!

Id: [0x000F2095]
A child's doll. I'm going to kill this neket iadet Crocodile.

Id: [0x000F2096]
Scrolls and ink. Nothing that tells me where Hotephres has gone. Wait… feathers. From a messenger pigeon?

Id: [0x000F2097]
The gladiatorial Arena. So the Crocodile recruits from this place for his personal army. I need to find out more about it.

Id: [0x000F209B]
Kensa? Is this the luxury you sought? To be a slave to an enemy of Egypt?

Id: [0x000F209C]
Greece and Egypt are divided. It is not just their gods that are different.

Id: [0x000F209D]
But with will and wisdom, we will unite them. Whatever it takes, we will make it so.

Id: [0x000F209E]
This land will be so much more. Its old roots will die and a new world will flourish.

Id: [0x000F20A9]
Is Faiyum not everything I told you it would be, dear friend?

Id: [0x000F20AA]
That and so much more. You must let us know your secret. There is enough grain to feed Alexandria here. Enough even for Rome.

Id: [0x000F20AB]
It is a question of knowing how to deal with the lower races. A kind word. A firm hand. Sweat on the fields and beauty in the streets.

Id: [0x000F20C5]
Are they still out there? Those ungrateful animals with their protests?

Id: [0x000F20C6]
Yes, my lady. But the men are ready to act at the first sign of trouble.

Id: [0x000F20C7]
I want them gone by the time my guests are ready to leave. By any means necessary. Use the gladiators.

Id: [0x000F20C9]
Anything to report?

Id: [0x000F20CA]
Nothing, my lady. The rebels have been routed, and the Egyptians give us little cause for concern.

Id: [0x000F20CB]
Some have gathered outside in protest. A pointless gesture.

Id: [0x000F20CC]
Have the men take names.

Id: [0x000F20CD]
Yes, my lady.

Id: [0x000F20CF]
The shipments remain punctual. No more examples need be made for the time being.

Id: [0x000F20D0]
Training is going as planned, my lady. It is as you said. Alexandria continues to grant us capable men.

Id: [0x000F20D1]
Good. I will ensure we will not lack soldiers. Our control over this land must be absolute.

Id: [0x000F20D4]
You! How dare you come here?!

Id: [0x000F20E8]
I knew you'd come, old friend. Perhaps I was always meant to die at your hand.

Id: [0x000F2101]
It is over. The Crocodile has won. The ledger, lost. My daughter… my Shadya… He has taken everything from us.

Id: [0x000F2102]
He will pay for this. And all those who serve him.

Id: [0x000F2103]
Only that there were other men with the soldiers. Large, imposing warriors. One red-haired.

Id: [0x000F2104]
Bandits? Soldiers?

Id: [0x000F2105]
I believe they were gladiators, from the arena in Krokodilopolis. It seems this… this monster uses fighters to do his bidding.

Id: [0x000F2106]
I will find this monster, friend. He will die.

Id: [0x000F2160]
Shit, it's good to see you. What are you doing in Faiyum?

Id: [0x000F2162]
I heard this was a good place to… to prosper. But I never expected to find you here, Kensa.

Id: [0x000F2165]
What can I say? I heard the call of the arena. Can you believe it? I am a gladiator now!

Id: [0x000F2166]
But come, come. Let us talk… and drink! Ha ha ha!

Id: [0x000F2179]
As it happens, the Iberian was torn apart by lions yesterday. I may have an opening. And if Kensa vouches for you…

Id: [0x000F217B]
You will need a title if you are going to team up, though. How about the Siwan Warriors?

Id: [0x000F217D]
I think "The Guardians of Siwa" would be more fitting.

Id: [0x000F217E]
Is that memorable enough for you?

Id: [0x000F217F]
I have heard worse. Come inside.

Id: [0x000F2182]
This is where combatants wait their turn on the sand. What you smell is sweat, blood, and not a little offal. If you are predisposed to shitting your armor, this is where to do it.

Id: [0x000F2184]
This is where you will probably die. Try to do it with drama, it pleases the crowd. On the off-chance you live, you will be rewarded with glory and fame. And another chance to die.

Id: [0x000F218D]
Kallistos, a former soldier of Ptolemy who claims to know how to handle a sword.

Id: [0x000F2190]
Horus. He was my best fighter once, but age ruins us all. He is not much more than a bedpan now. He trains the novices.

Id: [0x000F2194]
You already know Kensa, whose glowing but suspect recommendation brought you here.

Id: [0x000F2195]
Bayek! Krokodilopolis welcomes another champion!

Id: [0x000F2196]
Or another bag of blood and shit. I want to see if he can fight. And who better to test him than the one who recommended him?

Id: [0x000F2197]
What do you say? Ready to draw sword old Medjay?

Id: [0x000F2198]
Let's see if you have improved.

Id: [0x000F21B1]
Our main obstacle to glory. The Gallic brothers.

Id: [0x000F21B2]
I know who they are.

Id: [0x000F21B6]
Victory for the Guardians of Siwa! The new darlings of the Arena! Who knows how far they can go?

Id: [0x000F21BA]
The Guardians of Siwa are victorious once again!

Id: [0x000F21DE]
The Gallic brothers are defeated!

Id: [0x000F21DF]
Now, what fate awaits the fallen?

Id: [0x000F21E2]
Death.

Id: [0x000F21E5]
Crocodile!

Id: [0x000F21E7]
You killed a child called Shadya. Death is the least you deserve.

Id: [0x000F21FB]
Khaliset is nowhere to be found, it's time Mered comes clean

Id: [0x000F2203]
Something happened here

Id: [0x000F2205]
Murdered… by one of you…

Id: [0x000F2206]
Shadya.

Id: [0x000F2208]
Is that what you tell yourself?

Id: [0x000F2209]
Like all of your kind, you fail to see what greatness lies in store for Egypt.

Id: [0x000F220C]
Who?

Id: [0x000F220F]
She was the child you drowned.

Id: [0x000F2211]
Khenut was a stubborn rock. That ledger would have meant the end to all our hopes.

Id: [0x000F2218]
I will destroy everything you stand for, Berenike. And I will destroy all others like you.

Id: [0x000F221A]
But for now, all that matters is that you killed Shadya. And the last word you will remember is her name.

Id: [0x000F2221]
I should find this Zervos, and see what he knows about Sefetu. See if he is connected to the Scarab. I will ask among the merchants. See which are friendly to him.

Id: [0x000F2224]
By order of Sefetu, a curfew is imposed in town after dusk!

Id: [0x000F2226]
Back to your homes, by order of Sefetu! Curfew is imposed!

Id: [0x000F2381]
You're back, can you afford my services though?

Id: [0x000F2382]
Here's your money

Id: [0x000F2383]
Great, now we can do business

Id: [0x000F2384]
Come back when you have more coin

Id: [0x000F23FB]
You two make a good team. Hotephres has lost none of his fire.

Id: [0x000F23FC]
You sound proud of him.

Id: [0x000F23FD]
It is nice to have back the man I married.

Id: [0x000F23FE]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x000F23FF]
There is a rebel camp nearby. It is to the east of here, by Fort Boubastos. We are going to meet with them.

Id: [0x000F2401]
Rebels? Will dealing with them not earn the wrath of Alexandria?

Id: [0x000F2402]
Alexandria is no stranger to intrigue, Medjay. Favors are sometimes traded for information or protection.

Id: [0x000F2403]
Such alliances are necessary, if not officially acknowledged.

Id: [0x000F2404]
This way. Their camp is just up ahead.

Id: [0x000F2405]
We should be cautious. Rebels are not known for their hospitality.

Id: [0x000F2406]
I sent word. They are expecting us.

Id: [0x000F2407]
There. More of Ptolemy's ships!

Id: [0x000F2408]
They'll want to box us in, and drive us against the shore.

Id: [0x000F2409]
I see that look in your eyes. Why should we fight them? We can just barge on through and head straight for Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F2440]
I saw you with the Phylakitai of Karanis. Are you a protector?

Id: [0x000F2441]
I am. Is there something wrong?

Id: [0x000F2442]
Please, we need your help. Yesterday my husband witnessed something... frightening. Soldiers dragged a poor man beneath the temple. Then he heard screams!

Id: [0x000F2445]
We're already hungry because there's no grain. Now I'm terrified the soldiers will take my husband. We don't know who we can trust, not even the Phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F2446]
Stonemason, your wife has been to see me.

Id: [0x000F2447]
Shhh! How did you get up here? By Amun, that woman interferes. I told her, "What can we do?" Just act normal. Yeah, that's it. Stay normal.

Id: [0x000F2448]
Calm yourself! She said you saw soldiers take someone below the temple.

Id: [0x000F2449]
Yes. No! Yes. Okay, it's true. It wasn't the first time, but yesterday was different. There were screams that would wake the gods themselves! So many screams!

Id: [0x000F244B]
By Amun! What has been done here?

Id: [0x000F244C]
Someone called the Butcher is strong-arming farmers. I need to find him. I should follow this trail of loot. A bathing Sobek. Bathing... must be in water. A Sobek in water...hmmm...

Id: [0x000F2450]
A statue in the lake. That must be the "bathing Sobek" from the Butcher's letter.

Id: [0x000F2456]
There's an engraving on the chest depicting Soknopaiou. That is a village West of here.

Id: [0x000F2457]
The coins are in bags normally used to store grain. Did this come from a storehouse?

Id: [0x000F2458]
That is a lot of guards for a simple storehouse.

Id: [0x000F2459]
This must be the place. I have to get past them if I want answers.

Id: [0x000F245A]
I hear they took his arm at the Butcher's order. I guess we are common thugs now, not soldiers.

Id: [0x000F245B]
Shh, keep your voice down!

Id: [0x000F245D]
The Butcher will be nearby. What are these goons hiding?

Id: [0x000F245E]
This is where they're hiding all the grain. Taken straight from the tables of Faiyum families. Damn these greedy neket iadet. I should look around.

Id: [0x000F245F]
Ledger entries showing payments for grain. The Butcher is not paying the farmers even enough to live. I need to find information on where he is.

Id: [0x000F2461]
It is time this Butcher and I had a talk.

Id: [0x000F2462]
More grain. The poor are starving while the rich fill their storehouses. This has to stop. I should keep looking around.

Id: [0x000F2463]
Ah, this is it. The Butcher is in the villa nearby.

Id: [0x000F2464]
Once the shipment arrives, leave immediately. We can thank those fanatical Wadjet cultists in Karanis for taking the attention off us.

Id: [0x000F2465]
Shut your mouth and do your job. That grain is what pays for your beer and women. Or did you think they like you because you're a soldier?

Id: [0x000F2467]
A palatial villa. Built on the backs of Faiyum's farmers, no doubt.

Id: [0x000F248D]
I have trouble obeying orders, and the army frowns on that. But I have a family to support, so here I am.

Id: [0x000F248E]
Viridovix and Diovicos? I haven't been thought worthy yet. In that, I consider myself fortunate.

Id: [0x000F2491]
Are you well, my friend? You seem distracted. Don't worry, you will lose your nerves after the first fight.

Id: [0x000F2492]
Now that is a story! I was taken as a slave during Ptolemy's time in Siwa. A sick beast named Septimius and his clan were going to use me.

Id: [0x000F2493]
But enough about the past! I can't tell you how happy I am to share this good fortune with you.

Id: [0x000F2494]
Soon the crowds will worship you almost as much as they worship me.

Id: [0x000F2495]
Ha ha! You are primed indeed! Let Felix know when you are ready for our first match. The sooner we start, the sooner we're champions!

Id: [0x000F24C8]
Can you see the look on their faces? They adore me, Bayek! The men. The women. I have everything I could want.

Id: [0x000F24C9]
Keep fighting like this, old friend, and we'll catch the eye of a wealthy patron!

Id: [0x000F24CA]
Then a whole new world of opportunity my friend.

Id: [0x000F24D5]
Who's going to lead you Greens now, malakia?

Id: [0x000F24D7]
You're a babe at the teat! You think you can win the Cursus Magnus? Horseshit!

Id: [0x000F24D8]
Though to be honest I hope you make it. I am weary of you nagging me.

Id: [0x000F24D9]
God's and piss, not you too! Just concentrate on the next round.

Id: [0x000F24DA]
For annoying me, I am adding lions this time. They have not eaten for days. You are their dinner. Find me when you are ready.

Id: [0x000F24E1]
Alright Hermes, there's a good boy.

Id: [0x000F24E2]
So what's so special about you Hermes?

Id: [0x000F24E3]
The way your master talked about you, I half expected you to fly! (laugh)

Id: [0x000F253D]
We don't make the trips until sundown. Come see me then, by the northern entrance.

Id: [0x000F2550]
Leave Nikias alone. Icarus's death was a dark day for all of us. Let him weep in peace.

Id: [0x000F257F]
What is this?

Id: [0x000F25D0]
I need another drink.

Id: [0x000F25DD]
Have you done what I asked of you?

Id: [0x000F25DE]
The cart was destroyed

Id: [0x000F25DF]
Curse the gods, but you've tried at least

Id: [0x000F25E0]
Your cart is here

Id: [0x000F25E1]
Not now. Find me at my stall 

Id: [0x000F25E2]
Can't you see that I'm resting? Find me at the marketplace at nightfall if you'd like to trade

Id: [0x000F2621]
Pardon, neb. I overheard Claridas say you once rode together? My father sponsors the Prasina Greens, and we are in need of a mighty racer.

Id: [0x000F2624]
I am only here to drink. And forget.

Id: [0x000F2627]
Did you hear where the bandits meant to go?

Id: [0x000F2640]
Her wealth comes from her estate north of the city. Kerkesoucha granary, the largest in all of Egypt.

Id: [0x000F2656]
An inventory. The talisman in blue faience is listed here.

Id: [0x000F2658]
"The Giver of Light beholds with joy the resting place of the priest Horapollo and his wife Shesh…"

Id: [0x000F265A]
Nothing of value in this room.

Id: [0x000F265B]
Why would the merchant sell such cheap goods here?

Id: [0x000F26D9]
They've sent an Octareme! A floating city!

Id: [0x000F26DA]
Blast! Do the gods wish my fleet destroyed! Fickle Poseidon! This old fish will stick in your grizzled throat!

Id: [0x000F26DB]
Bear up old man, let's not offend the gods without cause!

Id: [0x000F26DC]
We have one last beast to hunt!

Id: [0x000F26DE]
Two ships down! Damn Ptolemy. Did make a fine navy, though. I'm no poxy general with bottomless Roman coffers! Those were my men!

Id: [0x000F26DF]
Easy, Phoxidas. We're not done yet. Our catapults will do their work. We'll make them pay!

Id: [0x000F26E8]
I do not want to kill you, Kensa. But look who you serve now.

Id: [0x000F26F3]
Are you enjoying your new station, my champion?

Id: [0x000F26F4]
Yes, my lady. It is everything I hoped it would be.

Id: [0x000F26F5]
You will want for nothing as long as you stay by my side. As long as you are loyal. As long as you never fail me.

Id: [0x000F26F6]
Yes, my lady.

Id: [0x000F2738]
I know your kind. What did you dig up this time? It sure caught the eyes of those bandits.

Id: [0x000F2739]
A ring of unparalleled riches, as you can see, everyone wants it. Those bandits dragged me around trying to find it.

Id: [0x000F2745]
You abandoned your name, your home-

Id: [0x000F2747]
I have no ambition to race at the Hippodrome-

Id: [0x000F2748]
You? No, never. They cheer for me! Besides, you would need a sponsor, a real chariot...

Id: [0x000F274B]
Now Icarus, he was a true hero. Did you know he won a thousand races? And survived twice as many!

Id: [0x000F274E]
That ring is worth millions of drachmas. Cleopatra would lay you if you gave it to her.

Id: [0x000F2752]
See how they loved Icarus!

Id: [0x000F2756]
Another brother! But between you and I, I do not trust him with the ring. Nebti either.

Id: [0x000F2763]
...I found it. Did you not hear me? About Turo?

Id: [0x000F2764]
Be safe.

Id: [0x000F2765]
What happened here?

Id: [0x000F2773]
You have adopted their gods, too.

Id: [0x000F277F]
You're lucky I left. If I had stayed, Aya would have been mine.

Id: [0x000F2780]
I never-

Id: [0x000F2781]
Doesn't matter. I have found fame!

Id: [0x000F2782]
At what cost? You gave up your home, your name, your gods! You chose this path.

Id: [0x000F2783]
And it has brought me all the coin and cunt I want!

Id: [0x000F2784]
You always wanted glory. It's not what drives all of us.

Id: [0x000F2785]
Yeah? I dare you to shut me up!

Id: [0x000F2786]
C'mon! Hit me!

Id: [0x000F2789]
You really think you can roll onto the track and win races with no training? No skill? Piss on you!

Id: [0x000F278A]
Maybe I should seek this Nikias out and hear his offer. If you can win, Claridas, it can't be that hard.

Id: [0x000F278B]
You might want to pray first. You'll need all the help you can get to survive the Hippodrome!

Id: [0x000F278C]
The gods will watch us race and decide.

Id: [0x000F278D]
You have your gods, I have mine. We'll see who rides out covered in glory!

Id: [0x000F27B6]
Rudjek's arrow. I marked his name off my list with this. Now it sits on the ground, forgotten.

Id: [0x000F27B7]
Rudjek's mask. I barely remember what happened after I stabbed him.

Id: [0x000F2A30]
Too well, by half.

Id: [0x000F2A31]
Come! He would love to meet you.

Id: [0x000F2A93]
You have a light touch!

Pharaoh? This is no gift, these are my sister's friends, it is a trap.

Id: [0x000F2C03]
Excuse me, but I have some business to attend to. I'll be back soon.

Id: [0x000F2C05]
Are you mad? Those guards are looking for me! Leave before you give me away!

Id: [0x000F2C0E]
Thank you, neb. Their souls will now rest in peace.

Id: [0x000F2C0F]
Who is this Meketre your aunt mourns?

Id: [0x000F2C16]
Why would Flavius do this? They are just poor Siwan farmers.

Id: [0x000F2C17]
Fresh cart tracks and footprints.

Id: [0x000F2C19]
The Romans have threatened to take the farmers to the Citadel before.

Id: [0x000F2C1A]
There are still soldiers here.

Id: [0x000F2C1D]
He will not stop till he reaches Rome. Then it too will fall before his godless ambition.

Id: [0x000F2C1E]
The cruelty Flavius inflicted here, it sickens me.

Id: [0x000F2C24]
Evening Sir. Looking for anything in ... particular? 

Id: [0x000F2C25]
I hear you have a fine set of twins. I'd like them for the night. 

Id: [0x000F2C26]
They aren't quite on the clock tonight, sir...

Id: [0x000F2C27]
I can pay handsomely. ...Here.

Id: [0x000F2C28]
I see. ... You can wait upstairs. Thank you for your patronage.

Id: [0x000F2C29]
Very good

Id: [0x000F2C2A]
Bayek meets Servius and tells him he search to join a faction.

Id: [0x000F2C2B]
Servius offers Bayek to visit him at his ranch, he will make him spend his faction selection race.

Id: [0x000F2C2C]
Bayek, Claridas, Servius and Cletus are drunk.

Id: [0x000F2C2D]
Hey! Don't touch that! You are not one of them? They stole everything I found!

Id: [0x000F2C2E]
I'm not one of 'them'. I'm looking for a statuette that belonged to Letopolis... 

Id: [0x000F2C2F]
Ah! I found that too! THe priest of Serket took a lot from Letopolis when the city was abandonned... But they took that also. 

Id: [0x000F2C30]
Who? And where did they go? 

Id: [0x000F2C31]
The bandits! They disappeared into that cave. I could not fight them, I'm but a simple scholar. 

Id: [0x000F2C32]
Pretty far into teh wild for a simple scholar. I got your back as long as I get my statue back. 

Id: [0x000F2C4B]
[Scribe refers to Bayek not having visited all landmarks yet.]

Id: [0x000F2C4C]
[Scribe refers to Bayek needing to sneak treatise into palace.]

Id: [0x000F2C4D]
[Scribe says something about staying away from the Order of the Ancients.]

Id: [0x000F2C4E]
[Scribe tells Bayek to come back later.]

Id: [0x000F2C4F]
Old guy! I just spotted something down there!

Id: [0x000F2C50]
She's right, there is something in the ruins.

Id: [0x000F2C51]
I'm heading down there. You coming?

Id: [0x000F2C52]
Don't you need help to get down from the pyramid?

Id: [0x000F2C53]
I got my ways. See ya down there!

Id: [0x000F2C54]
Where are we going father?

Id: [0x000F2C55]
You know Khemu, when I was a young boy,

Id: [0x000F2C56]
I was like you. Scared to try, scared of everything.

Id: [0x000F2C57]
Then my dad, your grandfather, brought me to the hill.

Id: [0x000F2C58]
He told me one thing, one thing that changed my life forever.

Id: [0x000F2C59]
I was not afraid anymore. I felt strong...in control!

Id: [0x000F2C5A]
What did he tell you?

Id: [0x000F2C5B]
You'll see when we get there son.

Id: [0x000F2C5C]
Father? You're leaving?

Id: [0x000F2C5D]
Aren't we going to train?

Id: [0x000F2C5E]
Father?

Id: [0x000F2C5F]
Don't leave me!

Id: [0x000F2C60]
I won't. Stop being so scared Khemu!

Id: [0x000F2C61]
I won't. Stop being so scared Khemu!

Id: [0x000F2C62]
Ok, I'm there...there's nothing to be afraid of.

Id: [0x000F2C63]
Father! Please!

Id: [0x000F2C64]
Yes I'm back...

Id: [0x000F2C6B]
I'm sorry father...can we go home?

Id: [0x000F2C6C]
No Khemu, you can do this.

Id: [0x000F2C6D]
Get to one of the dummy.

Id: [0x000F2C6E]
Draw your sword and attack it.

Id: [0x000F2C6F]
Arg...it hurts!

Id: [0x000F2C70]
Ok come here.

Id: [0x000F2C71]
When I raise my shield, you hit with all your strenght.

Id: [0x000F2C72]
There...Now another time.

Id: [0x000F2C73]
STRONGER KHEMU!

Id: [0x000F2C74]
I can't father, it really hurts!

Id: [0x000F2C75]
Ok enough...

Id: [0x000F2C76]
I'm sorry...I...I want to be strong like you.

Id: [0x000F2C77]
Ok follow me.

Id: [0x000F2C78]
Ok, we're here...remember last time?

Id: [0x000F2C79]
Yes but...I don't li...

Id: [0x000F2C7A]
Ok...look at how I shoot.

Id: [0x000F2C7B]
See how I align my arm and my eyes?

Id: [0x000F2C7C]
Place yourself here and shoot the targets.

Id: [0x000F2C7D]
Yes father.

Id: [0x000F2C7E]
Ok shoot!

Id: [0x000F2C7F]
Not like that!

Id: [0x000F2C80]
Your arm Khemu! raise your arm!

Id: [0x000F2C81]
I...I...It's difficult!

Id: [0x000F2C82]
Focus your attention on the target.

Id: [0x000F2C83]
Ok stop stop stop...let's try something else.

Id: [0x000F2C84]
Father...It hurts!

Id: [0x000F2C85]
I know son, you're going to be alright

Id: [0x000F2C86]
Aaaahhhh 

Id: [0x000F2C87]
Hang in there my boy!

Id: [0x000F2C88]
You see, I did...what you showed me...

Id: [0x000F2C89]
Yes Khemu, you did...you did.

Id: [0x000F2C8A]
Kof Kof Kof

Id: [0x000F2C8B]
For fuck's sake, move! Get out of my way!

Id: [0x000F2C8C]
Be strong Khemu, we'll arrive soon!

Id: [0x000F2C8D]
Aiiiiieee!!!

Id: [0x000F2C8E]
Keep your hands on the wound Khemu! 

Id: [0x000F2C8F]
Kof Kof! where's mom?

Id: [0x000F2C90]
Everything will be fine soon!

Id: [0x000F2C91]
BAYEK! Everything's ready! Hurry!

Id: [0x000F2C92]
See? Mom's there!

Id: [0x000F2C93]
Oh no no no no don't do that!

Id: [0x000F2C94]
Answer me son! Khemu!

Id: [0x000F2C95]
Son! It's me I'm there!

Id: [0x000F2C96]
That way father?

Id: [0x000F2C97]
Yes son, that way.

Id: [0x000F2C98]
Father...I'm not sure If I...

Id: [0x000F2C99]
You'll be okay Khemu, stop worrying.

Id: [0x000F2C9A]
But...I'm not like you...

Id: [0x000F2C9B]
You keep saying that at my age you were strong and...

Id: [0x000F2C9C]
Enough son!

Id: [0x000F2C9D]
This is why we're here. To train you.

Id: [0x000F2C9E]
...sorry...

Id: [0x000F2C9F]
Father? You're leaving?

Id: [0x000F2CA0]
Aren't we going to train?

Id: [0x000F2CA1]
Father?

Id: [0x000F2CA2]
Don't leave me!

Id: [0x000F2CA3]
I won't. Stop being so scared Khemu!

Id: [0x000F2CA4]
Please come back! I'm scared!

Id: [0x000F2CA5]
Ok, I'm there...there's nothing to be afraid of.

Id: [0x000F2CA6]
Father! Please!

Id: [0x000F2CA7]
Yes I'm back...

Id: [0x000F2CB5]
You're not here to kill me?

Id: [0x000F2CB6]
If that is your first thought, it is rather disconcerting. What sort of mess have you gotten yourself into?

Id: [0x000F2CB7]
I'm not quite sure, truthfully. 

Id: [0x000F2CB8]
We need to find a way out of here.

Id: [0x000F2CB9]
Well, I must say, you are a resourceful one. Many thanks, you don't know what you've done for me.

Id: [0x000F2CBA]
\\\ Hiji takes a hard look at Bayek. ///

Id: [0x000F2CBB]
If my eyes had started to fail me, I would have mistaken you for my son. Not from these parts, hm?

Id: [0x000F2CBC]
What makes you think so?

Id: [0x000F2CBD]
If you were, you would not be doing what you're doing.

Id: [0x000F2CBE]
You need not be concerned for me.

Id: [0x000F2CBF]
Ah, so you are brave.

Id: [0x000F2CC0]
Not stupid. What will you do now?

Id: [0x000F2CC1]
Leave. It has been in my heart for some time now, the thought of my son returning to find an empty home the only thing stopping me.

Id: [0x000F2CC2]
Bes has perhaps brought us together, is his name Edfu?

Id: [0x000F2CC3]
You've seen him!? In Heliopolis, surely! Is he a tutor now? Scribe? Scholar?

Id: [0x000F2CC4]
Where would I find him?

Id: [0x000F2CC5]
Oh these are merely the ill placed hopes of an attached father, I'm afraid. He left long ago to pursue his education and find work. He won't come back. It's time I accept that. Farewell, traveler.

Id: [0x000F2CC6]
Go in peace Hiji, if I ever encounter your son, I'll let him know what has happen to you. 

Id: [0x000F2CC7]
You should really get back to work...

Id: [0x000F2CC8]
But I'm on my break! 

Id: [0x000F2CC9]
Not anymore. Hurry up! 

Id: [0x000F2CCA]
Bayek: I'm looking for a friend of Apollodorus'

Id: [0x000F2CCB]
Vitruvius: Vitruvius! Nice to meet you! With what purpose do you seek me?

Id: [0x000F2CCC]
Bayek: I'm looking to help with anything I can.

Id: [0x000F2CCD]
Vitruvius: Then you came to the right place. Sadly I've misplaced my research somewhere at the Quarry, while inspecting for improvements.

Id: [0x000F2CCE]
Bayek: Improvements?

Id: [0x000F2CCF]
Vitruvius: Yes. I am an architect. The Proconsul requested me to leave Rome and help with some of the bigger projects he has going on here.

Id: [0x000F2CD0]
Bayek: Why is a Roman then helping Apollodorus?

Id: [0x000F2CD1]
Vitruvius: A story for another time maybe? Now it is important that we find those documents, because if they get into the wrong hands, it would sure lead to trouble!

Id: [0x000F2CD2]
Bayek: Just point me where to look.

Id: [0x000F2CD3]
Vitruvius: I last saw them while inspecting the lowest part of the Quarry, where they found a water source.

Id: [0x000F2CD4]
Bayek: Understood. Consider it done!

Id: [0x000F2CF6]
Boy, you must stay here. The way forward is dangerous. I will do everything in my power to rescue your father.

Id: [0x000F2CF7]
Saving my father is my duty, not yours. I am not a boy. I am Rahotep of Dionysias, and I am going.

Id: [0x000F2CF8]
I am Bayek of Siwa and I will not take you into danger.

Id: [0x000F2CF9]
You are not taking me. I am taking myself.

Id: [0x000F2DF8]
Seni! I saw what happened with the soldiers.

Id: [0x000F2DF9]
Nebet Khenut took a big risk. I appreciate what she did, but it won't change anything.

Id: [0x000F2DFA]
I'm sorry, but I must keep working. I've got a stack of fires to light.

Id: [0x000F2E01]
Hotephres? He abandoned us long ago! [Sigh] His father was a good man. He gave his son an Egyptian name. We loved him for that. But he could not give him an Egyptian heart.

Id: [0x000F2E02]
Hotephres means "satisfied" in our tongue, but he never was. He soon left us to the hyenas and crocodiles…

Id: [0x000F2E5D]
You fight well for someone retired.

Id: [0x000F2E5E]
Ha! I am not old yet, Siwan.

Id: [0x000F2E5F]
I can see that.

Id: [0x000F2E60]
I inherited more than a strong sword arm. I will hire a private army if I need to!

Id: [0x000F2FF1]
Hilarus you old grain bag, your days are over!

Id: [0x000F2FF2]
Don't worry, I've got enough left for you!

Id: [0x000F2FF3]
You are slow and weak! You can barely punch!

Id: [0x000F2FF5]
Be done with it! Your bones will break next time!

Id: [0x000F2FF6]
Why did you send me to the top of the lighthouse?

Id: [0x000F2FF7]
I have something to say to you. Hilarus is serious now. Students do not question their teachers.

Id: [0x000F2FF8]
Old tomato, you are not my teacher…

Id: [0x000F2FF9]
I love that lighthouse, lost my virginity there. I wanted you to see it. That, and the climb is good for the lungs.

Id: [0x000F2FFA]
Your reward was the view.

Id: [0x000F2FFB]
It was worth it, don't you agree?

Id: [0x000F2FFC]
It was actually. It is nice to take the time to realize how beautiful the world is…

Id: [0x000F2FFD]
You see! There is always method in my madness, Bayek. Remember that.

Id: [0x000F2FFE]
What are you doing now!?

Id: [0x000F2FFF]
Racing you to the next fight!

Id: [0x000F3000]
By all the gods…

Id: [0x000F3001]
Not going to lose to an old man, are you?

Id: [0x000F3002]
(Puffing painfully.)

Id: [0x000F3003]
Rest easy grandpa.

Id: [0x000F3004]
Do not disrespect your teacher! I used to run circles in the arena for hours. Pompey called me The Camel of Hermes. I would never tire!

Id: [0x000F3008]
By Amun! You're not my… Pompey compared you to a camel?

Id: [0x000F3009]
Hilarus Maximus, The Camel of Hermes.

Id: [0x000F300C]
Hilarus… There must be something else you can do besides fighting.

Id: [0x000F300D]
What else is there! I once fought an entire garrison. You ever do that?

Id: [0x000F300F]
Ha-ha! Yes, it is a brothel. This is your next lesson - do not allow yourself to be distracted. Our last fight is inside.

Id: [0x000F3010]
Bayek, catch your breath. This one is going to be tough. When you are ready, let me know.

Id: [0x000F3011]
You are a little old for street brawling, aren't you?

Id: [0x000F3012]
You are going to lay into me with the insults, too? Youth is a state of mind, boy. The gods do not get old. But thanks for the help. It is good to have a brawling brother.

Id: [0x000F3013]
I eat a lot of punches. A surprise strategy involving well-placed scars and internal bruising.

Id: [0x000F3014]
Why were you fighting?

Id: [0x000F3015]
I did not agree to this! Cheating old man! I am done.

Id: [0x000F3016]
Who is the coward now, you little prick! Come back and finish the fight!

Id: [0x000F3019]
I have been fighting a long time. I was a champion when you were still on the tit! I have to fight.

Id: [0x000F301A]
What do you mean? Are you in some kind of trouble?

Id: [0x000F301B]
Trouble? No! I make money from street fighting.

Id: [0x000F301D]
Not everyone can afford the Gallic brothers in the arena. I give them a taste of it out here. It is a living if you can win some.

Id: [0x000F301F]
But if I had not come along…

Id: [0x000F3021]
It would have been another loss. It is cruel what age does to you. Hades! I miss the arena. I used to be good! I was Pompey's favorite for a time.

Id: [0x000F3022]
One thing the arena gave me was an eye for talent. And you've got it. With some pointers, you would look the part.

Id: [0x000F3023]
On one condition, old man. After this contract, you find another job.

Id: [0x000F3025]
But where is that old fool? He is late.

Id: [0x000F3026]
Bayek! Down here!

Id: [0x000F3027]
Why are you down there? You said to meet you up here!

Id: [0x000F3028]
Hurry. Come down. We have got a fight to get to!

Id: [0x000F3029]
It is the old melon, come to collect another beating.

Id: [0x000F302A]
Always the disrespect. It is going to bring you bad fate one day. Youth is a state of mind. Today I have got something special for you.

Id: [0x000F302B]
Oh look! Grandpa brought a second. Come on then, pretty boy. Let us see what you've got.

Id: [0x000F302D]
That was good work. A fine start! Almost worthy of the arena. What is your name, son?

Id: [0x000F3032]
Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F3033]
Hmm, not really a fighter's name though, is it? We will want something more memorable like the Siwan Pretty Boy. We can talk about that later. Training first.

Id: [0x000F3034]
The not-so-mighty Hilarus, come to claim lost glory.

Id: [0x000F3035]
I see the rumors are true. You've got yourself a pet lion to hide behind. It will not matter. I will beat him for the money. Then I will beat you for the pleasure.

Id: [0x000F3037]
Damn you! Cheating old man!

Id: [0x000F3038]
If you can bring friends to the fight, so can I! Men!

Id: [0x000F3115]
We used to come up here to watch the herons. Two of them built a nest together in that tree. We watched them bring fish for their young. We dreamed of our own children.

Id: [0x000F3116]
And you're sad because you did not have any.

Id: [0x000F3117]
You're not very good at this, Medjay. You're not making me feel any better.

Id: [0x000F313E]
Careful! It's steep.

Id: [0x000F313F]
Now you're worrying about heights? I have got something for you.

Id: [0x000F351C]
Here we are. Will you be okay?

Id: [0x000F3522]
Hmm. These scrolls tell me nothing useful. I should check upstairs.

Id: [0x000F3680]
Party orders to his slave. An expensive gathering.

Id: [0x000F3681]
A lot of complaints from the people, no-one seems happy!

Id: [0x000F3684]
Bribery, expensive parties and missing money from the treasury. This is the evidence that Leander is corrupt. But what is this about Diocles? A coup?

Id: [0x000F3685]
Is Leander paying prostitutes for pillow talk?

Id: [0x000F36A7]
Oh, I love my new doll, Bayek! I will name her… Iset, and she will be the protector of all Faiyum.

Id: [0x000F36A9]
Ever since Hotephres got ahold of that ledger, Faiyum has been on edge. Soldiers with torches patrol every night. And this alms kitchen was practically razed to the ground.

Id: [0x000F36AA]
They have left Shadya and me alone, at least. Hotephres has made sure of that.

Id: [0x000F36AB]
Where's the ledger now?

Id: [0x000F36B2]
Shadya, show Bayek the way to our home.

Id: [0x000F3A96]
Hermes wasn't only my fastest horse, but my best breeder. The mares miss him. I miss him. I'll pay you…

Id: [0x000F3A97]
You want me to rescue a horse?

Id: [0x000F3A9B]
Here you are boy, back with your master.

Id: [0x000F3A9C]
Hermes! You will get the best hay and my best mare tonight, old friend.

Id: [0x000F3A9D]
Quartermaster gave him to the Centurion up at the East fort. He won't come looking for him.

Id: [0x000F3A9F]
Those forts! They steal everything from us! Ah well, we will breed a strong line of champions from you, won't we, boy.

Id: [0x000F3AA0]
Here's your reward, friend, and well earned.

Id: [0x000F3AA9]
Do any of them have red hair?

Id: [0x000F3B13]
I need hyena ears, crocodile eggs, and vulture skulls.

Id: [0x000F3B19]
Yes I am the owner. Felix Martialus. Who are you? Another rough knuckle no-name seeking fame? [spits]

Id: [0x000F3B1A]
You mean the Gallic brothers. You heard right. But let me save you some time, camel boy. You cannot afford it. Now piss off before you scare away someone who can.

Id: [0x000F3B1E]
So the Gallic brothers are involved in Shadya's murder. But why are they doing the Crocodile's bidding? I need to get inside, and learn more.

Id: [0x000F3B1F]
The Arena owner mentioned a Siwan gladiator to the East at an Obelisk. I wonder if I know her. Siwa is a small place. I should go and see.

Id: [0x000F3B24]
I'm telling you, Bayek, I am so close to my dream. If only I was given the chance, I know I could become champion.

Id: [0x000F3B26]
I mean, wealth, luxury, fame! What more could a woman want?

Id: [0x000F3B27]
That's why I came to Faiyum. To make a new life for myself and bury the past. But I was turned away from the Arena doors.

Id: [0x000F3B28]
Felix is slow to trust outsiders. But do not worry. With my backing, we'll soon be fighting side by side.

Id: [0x000F3B2A]
First we drink. And in the morning we can go to the Arena for the proper introductions.

Id: [0x000F3B2C]
It's good to have you here, old friend.

Id: [0x000F3B30]
Rebels! Move in, leave none alive!

Id: [0x000F3B31]
Archers! Ready your arrows!

Id: [0x000F3B40]
Well now, what do you have for me?

Id: [0x000F3B69]
I can do that for you.

Id: [0x000F3B6D]
Pardon, neb, I cannot sell any chariots today… By Serapis, I cannot believe my eyes! That looks like a Medjay badge.

Id: [0x000F3B82]
Honorable Medjay, what news do you bring?

Id: [0x000F3B85]
It is done. A sacrifice made to honor the builder who was cut down.

Id: [0x000F3B9E]
[sniffs] A strong musk clouds the air… a tanner lives nearby.

Id: [0x000F3BC9]
It's Ba- Fine.

Id: [0x000F3C32]
What?! Here again? No! Please go! Someone will see you.

Id: [0x000F3C6C]
I should let Padiaset know about Sehetep. He is not going to like it.

Id: [0x000F3C71]
Padiaset has gained the help of a strong ally.

Id: [0x000F3C72]
The Medjay who raided our ship? Who is he?

Id: [0x000F3C73]
He's not from Faiyum. A rogue traveller by all reports. One of the old kingdom some say.

Id: [0x000F3C74]
The Old Kingdom is dead. I don't care who he is. I will feed his infidel carcass to Petsuchos.

Id: [0x000F3C75]
Do you think the Medjay will succeed?

Id: [0x000F3C76]
Yes. He is a stranger yet Sobek guides him.

Id: [0x000F3C77]
When this is over, Sehetep's priests will seek forgiveness. Be stern, but treat them fairly. None of us is beyond temptation.

Id: [0x000F3C78]
Yes Hem. Dua Sobek.

Id: [0x000F3C7D]
There is a tunnel on the other side. I should find a way in.

Id: [0x000F3C7E]
A carcass. It has been chewed but not eaten.

Id: [0x000F3C7F]
A foul-smelling liquid. Argh, the stench burns my eyes. Argh, nek!

Id: [0x000F3C80]
A discarded priest robe, and it's covered in blood. Whoever was wearing this was badly injured. The blood trail leads outside.

Id: [0x000F3C81]
Someone was injured in the enclosure. They went up the staircase.

Id: [0x000F3C85]
Guardian of Sobek, the sickness was not an omen from the gods. Your crocodiles were poisoned, but they'll recover.

Id: [0x000F3C86]
Poisoned? Are you sure? By whom? They will pay with their lives!

Id: [0x000F3C87]
Your own priest Sehetep was responsible. He is trying to increase offerings from your followers.

Id: [0x000F3C8A]
These are the scraps that Felix wants to throw our way? Ha ha ha! They make a poor meal, my brother!

Id: [0x000F3C8F]
You need more style and flash. But you have got a pleasing vicious streak for a sand dog. [spits] Okay, Kensa. You have got a new partner. We open the doors soon. Be ready.

Id: [0x000F3C90]
That's him! The Mouse. Dirty scoundrel.

Id: [0x000F3C91]
No, no, no. The soldiers have found my shop!

Id: [0x000F3CA3]
Ah Bayek, did you find my chest yet?

Id: [0x000F3CA4]
The Mouse's stash!

Id: [0x000F3D53]
The Citadel casts a long shadow over Cyrenaica. There are rumors that General Agrippa and Flavius are preparing for war.

Id: [0x000F3DA2]
Well, you did promise a challenge, Esio!

Id: [0x000F3DA3]
We are all watching.

Id: [0x000F3DC8]
Could you jump from up there?

Id: [0x000F3DC9]
That was the greatest thing I ever witnessed and I once saw a snake swallow a cat whole!

Id: [0x000F3DCB]
How can I refuse such a gracious offer? Lead the way, Esio.

Id: [0x000F3DCD]
I have one last leap in mind for you, Bayek. Are you ready for your greatest challenge?

Id: [0x000F3DD0]
Some of those scardy cats thought you would miss the cart, but I never doubted you.

Id: [0x000F3DD1]
I was not sure myself, Esio. So where next?

Id: [0x000F3DD2]
Me and my gang will give you the grand tour, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F3E26]
The gods are smiling! You are a true hero!

Id: [0x000F3E29]
Not all.

Id: [0x000F3E2A]
To get you out of all the trouble you get yourself into?

Id: [0x000F3E2C]
Our ring, yes, yes!

Id: [0x000F3E2F]
None.

Id: [0x000F3E30]
Hah. Sixty! You were not even close.

Id: [0x000F3E4F]
That old Siwa...I'd better stay low profile until I get to Hepzefa.

Id: [0x000F3E50]
Here we are...Hope he's home.

Id: [0x000F3E51]
Go ahead, call her. You probably still share that special bound of yours.

Id: [0x000F3E52]
Thanks you Hepzefa...I missed her.

Id: [0x000F3E53]
Oh well, I just gave her back to you. Rabiah is the one who healed her. She couldn't even fly few months ago.

Id: [0x000F3E54]
I'll make sure to pay her a visit and thank her. Now...about Medunamun...

Id: [0x000F3E5B]
That's it...not the finest one but that'll do it.

Id: [0x000F3E5C]
Maybe I should check on Rabiah and Benipe and give more time to Hepzefa's research.

Id: [0x000F3E5D]
Bayek! You've found the bow yet?

Id: [0x000F3E5E]
Your back? Oh...the bow is in the well, behind a rock.

Id: [0x000F3E5F]
Ha Bayek! Don't forget to thank Rabiah for Senu.

Id: [0x000F3E60]
Bayek? Have you been to Benipe's shop? it's a mess...

Id: [0x000F3E61]
You should be carefull while roaming in Siwa...Guards are everywhere...

Id: [0x000F3E62]
Hmm... Inhapi doesn't seem to be home

Id: [0x000F3E63]
Bayek!

Id: [0x000F3E65]
Have you seen my mother?

Id: [0x000F3E66]
No, I thought I would find her here

Id: [0x000F3E67]
Look, a lot of people are heading towards the pyramid. Maybe my mother's there, we should check it out

Id: [0x000F3E68]
TALK! We know you were in contact!

Id: [0x000F3E69]
We've exchanged few letters, yes, but I don't know where he is.

Id: [0x000F3E6A]
Don't play dumb with me Hepzefa.

Id: [0x000F3E6B]
You're lucky that we didn't burned you're  hole too.

Id: [0x000F3E6C]
We've interecepted you're last letter. We know he was coming back.

Id: [0x000F3E6D]
The men we've sent after him never came back...

Id: [0x000F3E6E]
You look worried. You should be...

Id: [0x000F3E6F]
SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!

Id: [0x000F3E70]
You'll speak when I'll tell you to speak or I'll snap your neck!

Id: [0x000F3E71]
Understood?

Id: [0x000F3E72]
UNDERSTOOD HEPZEFA?

Id: [0x000F3E73]
Yes

Id: [0x000F3E74]
Good! So now, tell me...Where is that Bayek?

Id: [0x000F3E75]
I...I don't know, he's not here!

Id: [0x000F3E76]
Hepzefa...Come on...don't make this more difficult.

Id: [0x000F3E77]
Arrrrggggg

Id: [0x000F3E78]
I don't care if I have to hurt you!

Id: [0x000F3E79]
Please, I'm telling you, I don't know anything

Id: [0x000F3E7A]
You're a bad liar Hepzefa.

Id: [0x000F3E7B]
Ouchhhh

Id: [0x000F3E7C]
Your family's in Yamu, right?

Id: [0x000F3E7D]
Don't you dare!

Id: [0x000F3E7E]
I won't...if you tell me where he is.

Id: [0x000F3E7F]
...

Id: [0x000F3E80]
You must have strong bonds, choosing him over your own blood.

Id: [0x000F3E81]
If you touch them, I'll kill you myself!

Id: [0x000F3E82]
Hahahaha

Id: [0x000F3E83]
You'll never find him, he'll get you first.

Id: [0x000F3E84]
Taunting me won't help you Hepzefa.

Id: [0x000F3E85]
ARGGG

Id: [0x000F3E86]
Speak!

Id: [0x000F3E87]
Arrrrgggg

Id: [0x000F3E88]
I SAID SPEAK!

Id: [0x000F3E89]
The more you cover him, the more your fate.

Id: [0x000F3E8A]
It has already been sealed 5 years ago.

Id: [0x000F3E8B]
Oh you won't die, it will end slowly and painfully.

Id: [0x000F3E8C]
I'm not afraid.

Id: [0x000F3E8D]
We'll see that...

Id: [0x000F3E8E]
Arrgggggg

Id: [0x000F3E8F]
What's that! He's there!

Id: [0x000F3E90]
BAYEK, LEAVE!!!!

Id: [0x000F3E91]
SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH!

Id: [0x000F3E92]
GET HIM

Id: [0x000F3E93]
SURRENDER BAYEK!

Id: [0x000F3E94]
I'LL KILL HIM!

Id: [0x000F3E95]
WHERE IS HE?

Id: [0x000F3E96]
BRING ME HIS HEAD

Id: [0x000F3E97]
GET HERE BAYEK, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!

Id: [0x000F3E98]
Finally! I thought you were afraid...

Id: [0x000F3E99]
Release him.

Id: [0x000F3E9A]
Only after your death.

Id: [0x000F3E9B]
Bayek! Careful!

Id: [0x000F3E9C]
Why did you came back here?

Id: [0x000F3E9D]
Surprised you made it that far!

Id: [0x000F3E9E]
I'll bring your head to Medunamun!

Id: [0x000F3E9F]
Once I'm done with you, I'll kill your little friend.

Id: [0x000F3EA0]
DIE!

Id: [0x000F3EA1]
Siwa is not yours anymore!

Id: [0x000F3EA2]
Thanks! We're not safe yet, his men are still around!

Id: [0x000F3F37]
No one on the streets after dark! By order of Sefetu!

Id: [0x000F3F3E]
That's right!

Id: [0x000F3F40]
Taxes us to death!

Id: [0x000F3F41]
He burned my cousin's farm!

Id: [0x000F3F42]
Careful with that!!!  I need every drop of that oil. 

Id: [0x000F3F43]
I'm trying! This stuff is heavy!

Id: [0x000F3F44]
Mind the torch! Ya wanna burn my boat  before I even leave!

Id: [0x000F3F45]
Relax, will ya! Its in the water!!

Id: [0x000F3F4D]
Forewarning Bayek. Once we board this ship, there's no turning back.

Id: [0x000F3F4E]
And we finish with the Queen on her throne, or each of our heads on a pike.

Id: [0x000F3F4F]
I understand.

Id: [0x000F3F99]
That's it! Benipe's tools.

Id: [0x000F3F9A]
What is that? A bag of tools?

Id: [0x000F3F9B]
Some weapon...not what I'm looking for.

Id: [0x000F3F9C]
No tools...just some materials.

Id: [0x000F3FB5]
Here we are...choose the weapon you want.

Id: [0x000F3FB6]
I'm sorry, this is all I can offer you.

Id: [0x000F3FB7]
Those Ptolemaic bastard stole me everything

Id: [0x000F3FB8]
Nice choice Bayek!

Id: [0x000F3FB9]
The general dead, you should be okay now.

Id: [0x000F3FBA]
Thank you so much. Pass by my shop when you want!

Id: [0x000F3FBB]
Get me out of here!

Id: [0x000F3FBC]
Is anyone there? If I wasn't a priest, I'd bash in all your skulls!

Id: [0x000F3FBD]
If someone's there, let me out and fight me!

Id: [0x000F3FBE]
Is someone there? Damn you all.

Id: [0x000F3FBF]
Get me out of here, by Amun!

Id: [0x000F3FCC]
Please! Let me out! My family needs me!

Id: [0x000F3FCD]
What do you want me to tell you? I know nothing!

Id: [0x000F3FCE]
Let me at least talk to my wife.

Id: [0x000F3FCF]
Bayek? Is that you? Get me out of here!

Id: [0x000F3FD0]
Wait! Bayek? Where are you going?

Id: [0x000F3FD8]
Water! Please! Water.

Id: [0x000F3FD9]
(coughs)... I am dying of thirst. Please.

Id: [0x000F3FDA]
By the love of Amun, please!

Id: [0x000F3FDB]
Bayek! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000F3FDC]
Careful. The soldiers are everywhere.

Id: [0x000F3FEF]
The well...why did you have to hide it there Hepzefa...

Id: [0x000F3FF0]
Where was that cache again? ...

Id: [0x000F3FF1]
Yes here...

Id: [0x000F3FF2]
A crack...no no this is not here.

Id: [0x000F3FF3]
No, that can't move. Damn, where is it alread?

Id: [0x000F3FF4]
No...I don't remember the cache being there.

Id: [0x000F403B]
That is blood pooling beneath this door!

Id: [0x000F403C]
Butchered Sobeks in Krokodilopolis! Gods, this is an illegal tannery.

Id: [0x000F4072]
Orders to kill me.

Id: [0x000F4073]
Those who hold them must die before I do.

Id: [0x000F4074]
Some palace...

Id: [0x000F4089]
Here are Mered's wares! Come have a look. Gems! Charms! Relics! Things you've never seen!

Id: [0x000F408A]
Fair prices. Fair trade. Mered's wares are right for you! Come uncover the secrets and mysteries of Egypt's past!

Id: [0x000F408D]
He's got quite the hook.

Id: [0x000F4090]
If I am to find the Hyena, I must first speak to Mered, Apollodorus' contact.

Id: [0x000F4091]
Here, your absurd fee.

Id: [0x000F4094]
Get going, before those bastards do something stupid with my mount.

Id: [0x000F409F]
Did you say something about a wife?

Id: [0x000F40A0]
Yes. Yours.

Id: [0x000F40A1]
See, I do not understand that.

Id: [0x000F40A2]
How could I have a wife? I am a virgin. At least, I think I am…

Id: [0x000F40A3]
I will hear no more on this subject. You can take it up with your wife.

Id: [0x000F40A4]
But you do not understand! Every woman I've ever tried to f--

Id: [0x000F40A5]
Please shut up.

Id: [0x000F40B1]
Hrm... Khaliset drew these symbols here. Was she trying to figure out their meaning?

Id: [0x000F40BA]
What is this place? A tomb beneath a tomb...

Id: [0x000F40BB]
This is not the work of Egyptians, Greeks, or Persians -- this was built long before...

Id: [0x000F40D0]
Oh yes, you are going to find his book? If by some miracle you do, thank you.

Id: [0x000F40D1]
We live nearby.

Id: [0x000F40E3]
Guards! Hepzefa...Damn it!!!

Id: [0x000F417B]
The cultists are murdering temple acolytes, public figures in Karanis. No-one knows why. Anyone could be their next target.

Id: [0x000F417C]
The timing is inconvenient. Years of work building over the poorly constructed Egyptian temple. Endless delays and problems. Now this.

Id: [0x000F417D]
The Greeks are terrified. They're saying locals are involved and are calling for blood.

Id: [0x000F417E]
There's a lot of pressure to solve this. But please, take your time, enjoy the temple.

Id: [0x000F417F]
Are you the Phylakitai?

Id: [0x000F4180]
Yes. Try not to trample the scene. My job is hard enough as it is.

Id: [0x000F4181]
My apologies, as a protector I am attracted to such scenes.

Id: [0x000F4182]
A fellow protector? Ah yes, I see your badge. You are a Medjay? From the Old Kingdom, wow! Forgive me. This gruesome business has us all on edge.

Id: [0x000F4184]
This is the latest in a series of chilling ritual murders by Wadjet cultists. To be honest, I'm a little out of my depth.

Id: [0x000F4186]
Perhaps you could help investigate? The cultists usually leave a message. I haven't figured it out yet. We could check the temple.

Id: [0x000F4187]
A Greek god where an Egyptian god once stood. This would make some in Egypt very angry.

Id: [0x000F4188]
Someone has smeared the god with green paint. The head's also been covered. Wait… something else is up there.

Id: [0x000F418C]
Wadjet is goddess protector of Upper and Lower Egypt. Someone is making a clear statement.

Id: [0x000F418D]
This is a lot of blood. Someone was bound and tortured here, in front of the statue. By the signs, they were cut up badly then dragged outside.

Id: [0x000F418E]
It must have been the poor acolyte. There was no-one else here. Why did they do this?

Id: [0x000F4197]
That's the High Priest! Those men have him surrounded. You must help him!

Id: [0x000F4198]
Quickly! Get to the main entrance and act when I do.

Id: [0x000F4199]
Wadjet, accept the blood of this blasphemer. Give us power to defeat the Greek devils.

Id: [0x000F419A]
This is madness! You gain nothing by killing me. Greece and Egypt grow together. Our gods do not fight. Why do we?

Id: [0x000F419B]
They were going to sacrifice me!

Id: [0x000F419C]
You are safe now. It is fortunate you were not at the temple. You would already be dead.

Id: [0x000F419D]
Serapis! They would have butchered me! These Egyptians are prayerless demons, and not men.

Id: [0x000F419E]
It was an Egyptian who saved you, priest. Remember that when you pray and give thanks. We Medjay protect all, regardless of their class.

Id: [0x000F419F]
I came as soon as the fighting began. I see I am too late! Thank you for your help, Medjay. It certainly made my work here easier.

Id: [0x000F41A0]
You have interesting timing. What do you know of these bandits?

Id: [0x000F41A1]
Egyptians unhappy with the Greeks here. Who knows what holes they crawl from?

Id: [0x000F41A2]
Seeing a Greek god in place of their own incensed them, no doubt.

Id: [0x000F41A3]
Understandably. You have not seen the last of such trouble, I think. The Ptolemies tend to divide us at times.

Id: [0x000F41A4]
Sadly, I agree. Greece has brought Egypt much wealth, yet some resist all progress.

Id: [0x000F41A5]
This depends on your idea of progress. Progress for Egypt, or for Greece? Farewell Phylakitai. Next time you protect, remember my code.

Id: [0x000F41CB]
Do not be afraid. Lucky for you, I am real. Stay here and keep hidden.

Id: [0x000F41E2]
Thank you. Who are you to attack soldiers so openly? Don't you fear waking Greece?

Id: [0x000F41E3]
I am Bayek of Siwa. And I am more afraid of Egypt sleeping.

Id: [0x000F41E4]
The Crazy Siwan… My men spoke of you! Fighting in the Arena single-handed like a madman! Nek! The Ptolemy dogs have no chance if you're on our side.

Id: [0x000F41E6]
Go! Now!

Id: [0x000F41E7]
The way back from here is clear. Before you go, I need a favor.

Id: [0x000F41E8]
Khenut is waiting at your camp. She will ask for your help to protect her people.

Id: [0x000F41E9]
I owe you my life. You have my word it will be done.

Id: [0x000F41EA]
Could you also tell her I go to Fort Boubastos. I have business with the Commander there.

Id: [0x000F41EB]
Alone against a fortified garrison? Are you crazy?

Id: [0x000F41EC]
Perhaps. I am Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F41EF]
Please… I've told you everything I know.

Id: [0x000F41F8]
Sounds like a crowd, protesting. People are gathering outside the fort.

Id: [0x000F41F9]
Horns. Voices. Someone else is attacking the fort!

Id: [0x000F41FA]
It seems all of Faiyum has turned against the commander.

Id: [0x000F41FB]
That is the end of his corruption. I should meet the others.

Id: [0x000F4289]
Do not disappoint them… or me.

Id: [0x000F428B]
I thought the lions were caged?

Id: [0x000F428C]
There are no rules in the Arena, seni!

Id: [0x000F428D]
Proconsul Flavius scares the shit from my bowels.

Id: [0x000F428E]
Did you hear the rumors? About Siwa?

Id: [0x000F428F]
That dung-smeared hole? Good riddance.

Id: [0x000F4290]
And now he's locked himself away in the Temple of Mars?

Id: [0x000F4291]
A chest!

Id: [0x000F4292]
Maybe I will find the key someday.

Id: [0x000F429A]
So you have finally given up trying to put the world to rights? Good. Such things are impossible.

Id: [0x000F429B]
Your time on this sand has ended.<CR>

Id: [0x000F429C]
Camel herders and shit-shovelers, that is all Egypt is.

Id: [0x000F429D]
Your mind will break eventually, just like all the others.

Id: [0x000F429E]
You should have joined the Order! You need us.

Id: [0x000F429F]
But you chose slavery.

Id: [0x000F42A0]
You're nothing but a farmer.

Id: [0x000F42D3]
Have you found my Book yet?

Id: [0x000F42D8]
Yes, Cyrene, the shining porticos of Roman conquest. It is north of here.

Id: [0x000F42D9]
Why would they take Nenet's son Kade?

Id: [0x000F42DA]
Against Egypt?

Id: [0x000F42DB]
Do you doubt their ambition?

Id: [0x000F42FC]
Everything allright?

Id: [0x000F42FD]
Yes... Alexander's visit to the oracle of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F42FE]
Brings a different perspective from the stories I've heard.

Id: [0x000F42FF]
I know Bayek...

Id: [0x000F4300]
Let's not keep Cleopatra wait too long.

Id: [0x000F4301]
I hope you know what you're doing...

Id: [0x000F4309]
What is your name?

Id: [0x000F430A]
Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F430D]
I should speak to Pasherenptah right away. He's likely at the Great Temple.

Id: [0x000F4347]
His villa is nearby. I know of a spot overlooking it from a safe distance. This way!

Id: [0x000F4348]
Your temple is the reason for this trouble. It is a bitterness for the locals.

Id: [0x000F4349]
That's absurd! It has increased industry and trade. Everyone has benefitted.

Id: [0x000F434A]
Your dead acolyte and High Priest may not agree.

Id: [0x000F434E]
Gods, the trouble I'll get if the High Priest lies dead! We must hurry.

Id: [0x000F43C3]
Counterfeit treasures are our game. We are the Fake Bandits here. Give us the money, and we might not kill you.

Id: [0x000F43C4]
There is no money left! It was all given away. Please, check for yourself. I've got nothing.

Id: [0x000F43C5]
I have got a nice sword. Would you like?

Id: [0x000F43C6]
Who in Hades are you?

Id: [0x000F43C9]
Mother he is not a bandit! He is my friend.

Id: [0x000F43CB]
He saved us? We have to give him something. We always repay kindness, remember.

Id: [0x000F43CD]
Thank-you. I'm honoured. Yes I can tell. This one's really real. There are almost none like it.

Id: [0x000F43E1]
I see you bear the markings of old Siwa. Is that a real Medjay badge? How much would you sell it for?

Id: [0x000F43E2]
Siwa is my homeland. And it is not for sale.

Id: [0x000F43E3]
Everything is for sale here. You should visit Valley Market, to the east. They have Siwan treasures. Not the normal fake stuff. These are real.

Id: [0x000F43E4]
I would be interested to meet anyone selling genuine Siwan treasures.

Id: [0x000F43E5]
Did you hear about that new stall with treasures from the Temple in Siwa?

Id: [0x000F43E6]
From a Temple? Are you crazy? You don't want something stolen from a god! Wait, are they real?

Id: [0x000F43E7]
Why do you think they're so expensive? I would sell my whole life for an Ankh of Amun!

Id: [0x000F43E8]
This is meant to be genuine, but it's a fake. And not a very good one.

Id: [0x000F43F1]
This is your stall?

Id: [0x000F43F2]
Yes, mine! Many unique treasures from faraway Siwa! Not fake! Not fake!

Id: [0x000F43F3]
Have you got anything... real? I'm sure these are not your best pieces.

Id: [0x000F43F4]
What do you mean! These are real! Hmm. More expensive ones at my camp. I can take you. Not far from here. You follow.

Id: [0x000F43F5]
That Medjay badge not very good you know. We have better ones. Would you like?

Id: [0x000F43F6]
These other treasures of yours, are they fake as well?

Id: [0x000F43F7]
I told you, not fake! Aw, how did you know. My treasures aren't really real, but not fake! My mother has some real ones anyway.

Id: [0x000F43F8]
I have a secret. I was once Medjay in Siwa. I have seen the real treasures.

Id: [0x000F43F9]
Aw, not fair! I made them all myself, you know. No one else can tell!

Id: [0x000F43FA]
Do not worry, they're very good fakes. I won't tell anyone.

Id: [0x000F43FB]
I said not fake! Were you really Medjay? Maybe you are fake!

Id: [0x000F43FF]
All right... who do we have? Ah, there is Kallistos.

Id: [0x000F4401]
Is that armor from Ptolemy's Army?

Id: [0x000F4402]
Most of the fighters cannot afford their own armor. In any case it is soon ruined. [spits] The army does not miss a few suits here and there. And it adds to the authenticity.

Id: [0x000F4404]
Two warriors against the odds! The crowds love unfair fights.

Id: [0x000F4405]
Greatness? Easy easy, damsel dust mite. You have a long way to go. It is a good start but you are not contenders. [spits] You do not get to the Gallic brothers by beating a few shit stain novices.

Id: [0x000F4456]
A cat really? And who are you?

Id: [0x000F4457]
Esiocles, but all my friends call me Esio.

Id: [0x000F4458]
Well Esio, I am Bayek.

Id: [0x000F4459]
How did you do that? Are you magic? Will you leap some more for me and my friends?

Id: [0x000F44AD]
You have a gang?

Id: [0x000F44AE]
Yes, I'm the most important child in Cyrene.

Id: [0x000F44AF]
I can see that, Esio.

Id: [0x000F44B0]
Let's go to the baths. It's where people walk around naked being scraped and scratched and rubbed with oils.

Id: [0x000F44B1]
It is why I shaved it off, Esio.

Id: [0x000F44B2]
Ha! Yes! Some fancy Roman from the Citadel built it…

Id: [0x000F44B4]
All that for somewhere you wash! When I grow up, I am going to have a wife who'll never make me wash.

Id: [0x000F44B5]
Wives like that are hard to find, Esio.

Id: [0x000F44BC]
Where do you find such fascinating items?

Id: [0x000F44BD]
Ah, trade secrets, my traveling friends. But I will tell you, Giza is full of ambitious "diggers!"

Id: [0x000F44BE]
Oh, relic hunters!?

Id: [0x000F44BF]
He means tomb robbers, you imbecile.

Id: [0x000F44FB]
Oh, haha, of course... clever use of words!

Id: [0x000F44FD]
I told you how much I'll pay. No more.

Id: [0x000F44FE]
And what are these beautiful crystals I keep hearing of?

Id: [0x000F44FF]
Those, my fair lady, are a rare treasure that only the deepest of pockets will fetch.

Id: [0x000F4500]
What's so special about them?

Id: [0x000F4501]
That, is for you to discover! Some say they can be used for great magic!

Id: [0x000F4502]
I want that...

Id: [0x000F4505]
Come on everyone, come see Bayek fly!

Id: [0x000F4506]
See! Didn't I tell you he was brave?

Id: [0x000F4507]
Oh my days, what if he falls?

Id: [0x000F4508]
He's stickier than a lizard on a rock.

Id: [0x000F4509]
Yay, yeah! Whoohoo! Look at him go.

Id: [0x000F450C]
You're Egyptian right? My father says you don't worship the same gods as we Greeks.

Id: [0x000F450D]
We have some in common. Like Serapis.

Id: [0x000F450E]
Oh yes, Serapis. I've heard of him. Apollo is all Greek and my favorite. He likes poetry, music, wine and all that kind of stuff.

Id: [0x000F450F]
I do, I used to hunt with my boy, Esio.

Id: [0x000F4510]
If you jump from his Temple there, then maybe he will be watching from Mount Olympus and reward me with my own bow and arrow so I can hunt rabbits in the woods!

Id: [0x000F4514]
This is it! Isn't Apollo marvelous?

Id: [0x000F4516]
He's so brave! Have you ever seen someone so brave?

Id: [0x000F4517]
And I am the one who found him.

Id: [0x000F4518]
I know, Esio. This is the best of days.

Id: [0x000F451A]
Make Apollo proud, Bayek!

Id: [0x000F451C]
You neket iadet! Do you know what we have to go through to get these?

Id: [0x000F451D]
Snakes! Hyenas! Bandits! Danger at every turn!

Id: [0x000F451E]
If you don't like what I'm offering, then go. Plenty of other scavengers to trade with.

Id: [0x000F4520]
Agh... You have got a deal...

Id: [0x000F4522]
What about that one?

Id: [0x000F4523]
No, not him. I have seen him dealing with that strange looking woman. I want nothing to do with her.

Id: [0x000F4524]
The one who walks among hyenas? That's just a story! The idea itself is preposterous!

Id: [0x000F4525]
Maybe you are right, but I would rather not find out that you were wrong.

Id: [0x000F4526]
Look at the bright side, you made it here alive. Otherwise, I'd be talking to bandits about these relics.

Id: [0x000F460C]
She's taken a dangerous route to the southwest past the hippopotamuses to avoid Sefetu's eyes. If you follow the coast, you'll find her.

Id: [0x000F460E]
If you say. I hide them in my village until we can arrange a caravan to get them beyond the desert. Hence the food and medicine I bring.

Id: [0x000F4611]
When they thought me broken, I-by the gods! Sefetu has come!

Id: [0x000F4612]
No! No! Pentu! Anen! Wenis!

Id: [0x000F4621]
I will go to Harkuf. We must find a way to peel Sefetu out of his shell, and deal with him.

Id: [0x000F463A]
Hmm. This must be from Harkuf's brewery.

Id: [0x000F4648]
Broken beer jars.

Id: [0x000F464D]
Someone could not wait to get into the beer.

Id: [0x000F4653]
He is happy this good prince: Death is a kindly fate. A generation passes, Another one stays,<LF>Since the time of the ancestors.

Id: [0x000F4654]
By the gods, you are maudlin when you're drunk!

Id: [0x000F4655]
Leave me alone!

Id: [0x000F4656]
Will she lift the curse on our city?

Id: [0x000F465A]
The gods who were before rest in their tombs, blessed nobles too are buried in their tombs. Yet those who built tombs, their places are gone, what has become of them?

Id: [0x000F465B]
How much beer is left?

Id: [0x000F465C]
Not much now. We would have more if you hadn't broken so many jars.

Id: [0x000F465D]
Piss off! We'll just have to make Harkuf's man brew more!

Id: [0x000F4665]
Then kill him with a burning dagger to the heart.

Id: [0x000F4667]
Wait! They thought I was dead and tossed me in the well. I crawled through corpses and escaped by an underground stream to the river.

Id: [0x000F4676]
What business do they have with Pompey?

Id: [0x000F4677]
Pompey's armies will give Cleopatra the throne. They mean to prevent the alliance before it happens. We must hurry!

Id: [0x000F4694]
Mered, that cheeky swindler. Acting as though his pouch is too light.

Id: [0x000F4695]
He still pays better than the others.

Id: [0x000F4696]
He can afford to pay more! He sells most of his relics to the one they call the Hyena, and she buys as though coin has no value.

Id: [0x000F4697]
Well, maybe we should trade directly with her.

Id: [0x000F4698]
I'm not going near that woman...

Id: [0x000F46A4]
I get a chuckle out of it every time!

Id: [0x000F46A5]
So let me get this straight. You follow some robbers into a tomb, and then sit and wait for them to come out?

Id: [0x000F46A6]
Yes! And they don't put up a fuss! They are scavengers! Unarmed and feeble!

Id: [0x000F46A7]
Brilliant. They do all the work, you collect the rewards.

Id: [0x000F46A8]
Harsh. (laughs) Smart... But harsh.

Id: [0x000F46BD]
We should be out of harm's way once we cross that bridge.

Id: [0x000F46BF]
I pray we have not lost more men.

Id: [0x000F46C2]
I will go check on the others. Go do something about Suphia.

Id: [0x000F46C3]
His name is Bayek, a dear friend of Nefertari's. I've asked him to come along and he graciously accepted.

Id: [0x000F46C4]
I suppose we all do.

Id: [0x000F46C7]
It's why we make the trips at night -- helps avoid trouble.

Id: [0x000F46FE]
I have got what I need. I should give the feather to the girl.

Id: [0x000F46FF]
I believe you can do anything, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F4702]
She used to play with me all the time, but now all she does is moon over that magistrate Diocles. And his stupid, floppy hair.

Id: [0x000F4703]
Some girls like that kind of thing.

Id: [0x000F4704]
Urgh.

Id: [0x000F4730]
Don't you have trouble with the Romans?

Id: [0x000F4731]
Well you know what they say about our Latin friends. The Greeks invented the threesome and the Romans added women. (laugh)<CR>

Id: [0x000F4734]
Bayek. Alright, let's see what you have, Mouse.

Id: [0x000F4736]
Is this where you hide, Hyena?

Id: [0x000F4741]
The children, Sir Bayek! I give them work, a roof over their little heads. Without me they'd be on the streets!

Id: [0x000F4742]
What gruesome madness happened here!? A dark place with a window to the gods.

Id: [0x000F4746]
The Centurion wants a word with you, you thieving rat. (laughs)

Id: [0x000F4748]
Get them, Sir Bayek.

Id: [0x000F4749]
They'll skin me or worse!

Id: [0x000F474A]
See, you Roman vultures, I have an Egyptian friend now! He hates you as much as I do!

Id: [0x000F4760]
Gods bless you, Sir Bayek. I will wait for you in the market behind the baths. Good luck, my friend.

Id: [0x000F476C]
Still warm. And this ceremonial knife. This was a sacrifice.

Id: [0x000F4786]
Hold steady!

Id: [0x000F4791]
She used a knife to sacrifice her captives. She collected their blood for some dark purpose.

Id: [0x000F4793]
Khaliset was doing a ritual. She began by calling to Osiris with these offerings.

Id: [0x000F4798]
I should be on my way now, brothers.

Id: [0x000F47AE]
It's impossible, right?

Id: [0x000F47AF]
I'm glad we joined Esio's gang, this is unbelievable.

Id: [0x000F47B3]
Who's Anta?

Id: [0x000F47B4]
Our protector! We were going back to Memphis when they took her. If we don't do as they say, they will kill her!

Id: [0x000F47C7]
What in Dionysus' name were you talking to Nikias about last night?

Id: [0x000F47C8]
Okay, yeah. Why not? I've got time.

Id: [0x000F480E]
Did you kill that clod of shit?

Id: [0x000F480F]
Come quickly, this place may still be dangerous.

Id: [0x000F4817]
Boohoohoo

Id: [0x000F4818]
What's wrong Inhapi? Ptahmose is dead, you should rejoice.

Id: [0x000F4819]
Apollodorus promised to find my son Theodoros, but I have not heard any news.

Id: [0x000F481A]
Theodoros? I met him in a ravine west of Memphis.

Id: [0x000F481B]
Did you?! Can you tell him to come back home?

Id: [0x000F481C]
I'll let him know

Id: [0x000F481D]
Let me help you. What do you know?

Id: [0x000F481E]
Last I heard, he joined the rebels

Id: [0x000F481F]
They are located near the mountains and ravine west of Memphis

Id: [0x000F4820]
I may be able to find him, I'll keep an eye out.

Id: [0x000F4828]
I... I need some rest. I'll be at my camp.

Id: [0x000F4829]
Theodoros, your mother wants you to come back.

Id: [0x000F482A]
*sigh* Alright, I'll delegate some tasks to my men and leave as soon as I am ready.

Id: [0x000F482B]
You can go on ahead. I'll meet you in Heliopolis.

Id: [0x000F482C]
But this Medjay is helping me!

Id: [0x000F486C]
We will stay in the palace until all politics are concluded.

Id: [0x000F486D]
Pompey was your enemy Caesar.

Id: [0x000F486E]
He was a Roman citizen.

Id: [0x000F4879]
Another favorite fable of mine is one of Aesop's more playful tales. The Eagle and the Jackdaw. It unfolds thusly...

Id: [0x000F487A]
There once was an eagle, soaring high above a shepherd's field, that swooped down on powerful wings to seize a grazing lamb and carry it off to her nest.

Id: [0x000F487B]
Flying close by, a jackdaw saw the deed, and it filled his head with the idea that he too was just as strong and capable.

Id: [0x000F487C]
So, with a great flapping and rustling of feathers, the jackdaw came down swiftly and clutched at the coat of a large ram.

Id: [0x000F487D]
But when he tried to fly away, he found he could not lift the animal, for his size and strength were not up to the task.

Id: [0x000F487E]
And even as the jackdaw struggled, the ram hardly noticed he was there.

Id: [0x000F487F]
Nearby, just across the field, the shepherd saw the fluttering bird and was quite amused. Running up, he captured the jackdaw and clipped its wings.

Id: [0x000F4880]
That evening he gave the jackdaw to his children as a gift.

Id: [0x000F4881]
"What an odd little bird this is, father!" they laughed and shouted. "What do you call him?"

Id: [0x000F4882]
"This is a jackdaw," the father said. "But if you should ask him, he would claim to be an eagle."

Id: [0x000F4883]
A lovely tale, don't you think? But what are we to make of it? On this point I believe Aesop was quite clear.

Id: [0x000F4884]
The eagle is our ideal self. Man's ultimate form. His essence, or Platonic ideal.

Id: [0x000F4885]
The Jackdaw, however, represents man as he truly is. Base born. Average. Clever perhaps, yet a scavenger nonetheless.

Id: [0x000F48CD]
If it was, I'd have my ring.

Id: [0x000F48D0]
No time for compromise! Let our dissent swell into a tumult of fire and change!

Id: [0x000F48D5]
Meet me after dark by the northern entrance.

Id: [0x000F48D7]
Later tonight, by the northern entrance. I'll be waiting for you there.

Id: [0x000F48DC]
Yes, that is right! Taste your own blood!

Id: [0x000F48DD]
Mercy! Mercy!

Id: [0x000F48DE]
Your tax collectors never listened when we begged for mercy.

Id: [0x000F48DF]
Go on! Hit him harder!

Id: [0x000F48E0]
Why do you let them do this?

Id: [0x000F48E2]
Cracks, it goes on...

Id: [0x000F48E3]
Mechanism is completely shattered and fell on the other side.

Id: [0x000F48E4]
Broken spear. The soldiers really tried everything.

Id: [0x000F48E5]
This place was about to fall apart.

Id: [0x000F48E6]
Breach on the wall.

Id: [0x000F48E7]
A gap in the structure.

Id: [0x000F48EA]
You see yourself the corruption. There is no-one to protect the people.

Id: [0x000F48EB]
Khenut, no! We can't.

Id: [0x000F48EC]
You live.

Id: [0x000F48ED]
It is true. The soldiers were only the beginning. We have to deal with this Commander.

Id: [0x000F48F1]
I did not know things were this bad. I mean, I knew there was trouble, just... not like this. This is my fault.

Id: [0x000F48F2]
Looks like the choice has been made for me. Come, brother. Let us talk to them… with our swords!

Id: [0x000F48F3]
I am Khenut. I sent word from Philadelphia that we were coming. We need your help.

Id: [0x000F48F4]
You had help. The farmers staged a protest to distract the soldiers. They were fearless!

Id: [0x000F493E]
He swoops through the air, like an eagle.

Id: [0x000F4940]
You did it, you did it!

Id: [0x000F4941]
Our friend Bayek does the impossible!

Id: [0x000F4942]
Let's go to the next jump!

Id: [0x000F4946]
I heard Cyrenaican horses are the best in the world?

Id: [0x000F4947]
They are! Which is why that cursed Roman Quartermaster stole my prized stallion Hermes.

Id: [0x000F4949]
That drunken thief Quartertmaster is probably already at the Archile Pandocheion by now.

Id: [0x000F4950]
That's it boy!

Id: [0x000F4951]
You do feel more powerful than other horses I have ridden. Strong and lithe!

Id: [0x000F495C]
That must be the thieving quartermaster.

Id: [0x000F496D]
Rudjek... I loved him. He promised me a better life! You took him from me!

Id: [0x000F497A]
No. You don't.

Id: [0x000F49B2]
Come on.[Grunt] Come on!

Id: [0x000F49B5]
Thank you, my friend. Apollodorus was right to bring you in. You honor the badge you wear.<LF>

Id: [0x000F49B7]
Please!

Id: [0x000F49B8]
Just a moment, I promise!

Id: [0x000F49BD]
You dare accuse me, you coward? You, who spent the past three days cringing behind the doors of our home?

Id: [0x000F49BE]
It is your spinelessness that dooms us, not my neglect!

Id: [0x000F49BF]
I am blamed for the whole city's troubles, and when I suggest we might share the blame, you deny all--

Id: [0x000F49C0]
I deny blame when I am free of it!

Id: [0x000F49C1]
Ask your little priestlings to see if they have neglected--

Id: [0x000F49C2]
Taimhotep, I visited them before I came to you!

Id: [0x000F49C3]
I have spoken to all the priests.

Id: [0x000F49C4]
Each one swears to handling your meals with the utmost care!

Id: [0x000F49C5]
And you trust their word over mine?

Id: [0x000F49E5]
Do you doubt my love for him? For you?

Id: [0x000F49E6]
No! But you are very agitated right now.

Id: [0x000F49E7]
I will vomit if I hear more.

Id: [0x000F49E8]
Have no doubt of this. If our child dies, I die.

Id: [0x000F49E9]
No, my lotus, do not speak like that!

Id: [0x000F49EA]
I must go to the Seer's house.

Id: [0x000F49EC]
Just leave me be.

Id: [0x000F49EF]
Apis, how have we wronged you?[sobbing]

Id: [0x000F49F0]
High Priest.

Id: [0x000F49F2]
Uh… ah, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F49F4]
I'm sorry. I'm, ah…[sigh]

Id: [0x000F49F8]
Oh, the Lizard…

Id: [0x000F49FC]
The curse touches even my own house.

Id: [0x000F49FD]
If she loses a fourth...[sobbing]

Id: [0x000F4A08]
The people look to me for guidance, but I am as lost as they.

Id: [0x000F4A0B]
My wife, Taimhotep, has miscarried three times this year. She is with child again, but if...

Id: [0x000F4A17]
Keep quiet. Head down.

Id: [0x000F4A22]
Me? I just want what it is worth. You think I enjoy being a scavenger?

Id: [0x000F4A23]
Yes... It is hard out here for us, you know? Bandits are always up our asses.

Id: [0x000F4A24]
This is my brother, gonna help us find the ring.

Id: [0x000F4A27]
We should check for our other brothers. They have the ring.

Id: [0x000F4A47]
Gaius Asina's invasion plans with maneuvers for all the ships? Burning these will throw the fleet into chaos.<CR><LF>

Id: [0x000F4A49]
Are you Titus? Your mother sent me.

Id: [0x000F4A60]
My Titus, my poor Titus. Imprisoned at the barracks for trying to leave the army.

Id: [0x000F4A63]
No, a hero. He'd had enough, stood up against the Roman army and joined the rebels. Please, he's my only child and all I have left.

Id: [0x000F4A72]
The fouls smell seems to be coming upstream

Id: [0x000F4A73]
The color of the water here is very strange 

Id: [0x000F4A7E]
If the romans have anything on Galenos,it will be at the Barracks!

Id: [0x000F4A7F]
No sign of The Manticore here, I must check the other dead drop!

Id: [0x000F4A80]
The letter from this Roman soldier reads that the Temple priests have discovered the black marketeer - The Manticore!

Id: [0x000F4A81]
They know the other dead drop locations and are planining an ambush so they can catch him!

Id: [0x000F4A82]
I must hurry and find The Manticore, before they catch him!

Id: [0x000F4A83]
These are Galenos's confessions, when I destroy them, his secret will be safe.

Id: [0x000F4A84]
Galenos, you were the Manticore this whole time!

Id: [0x000F4A85]
Why did you stop supplying the dead drops?

Id: [0x000F4A86]
I attempted to suppply them, but the Romans caught wind of me, and I was forced to hide.

Id: [0x000F4A87]
The last thing I remember is talking to a temple servant and then you found me...maybe they did something to me?

Id: [0x000F4A88]
Bayek, you must find out how did the romans knew about this.

Id: [0x000F4A89]
Pssst, Bayek I am in the haystack!

Id: [0x000F4A8A]
Theramenes I have taken care of your issue.

Id: [0x000F4A8B]
Will I be able to receive supplies again?

Id: [0x000F4A8C]
Yes, it turned out The Manticore is Galenos over here.

Id: [0x000F4A8D]
Just make sure to change all the locations to be safe!

Id: [0x000F4A8E]
Thank you Bayek, I will have the much needed materials now!

Id: [0x000F4A8F]
I am tired, I just cannot work under these conditions!

Id: [0x000F4A90]
What is the problem Theramenes?

Id: [0x000F4A91]
The temple is monopolizing the supplies of medicine, while I am stuck working with bare bone materials!

Id: [0x000F4A92]
I was even forced to rely on less official sources for my supplies.

Id: [0x000F4A93]
Can I assist you in some way?

Id: [0x000F4A94]
Well even my unnoficial shipments have stopped, even though I left money at the dead drop.

Id: [0x000F4A95]
I lost both my money and have no supplies, can you see if you can do something about it?

Id: [0x000F4A96]
Why did you do this crime?

Id: [0x000F4A97]
I had to, in order to defend my daughter!

Id: [0x000F4A98]
This vile roman scum tried to rape her, but she defended herself and killed him.

Id: [0x000F4A99]
Do not worry I have dealt with them, your daughter will be safe.

Id: [0x000F4A9A]
Thank you, I can die in peace now...

Id: [0x000F4A9B]
Someone tried to burn something important. The daughter is connected somehow. I should talk to her.

Id: [0x000F4A9C]
Greetings, can you tell me  where these limbs came from and why is your mark on them?

Id: [0x000F4A9D]
I have absolutely no idea, perhaps some of my workers have made this?

Id: [0x000F4A9E]
You are free to look around if you want

Id: [0x000F4A9F]
I will, but can you tell me who is that shy girl behind you?

Id: [0x000F4AA0]
Oh, that is just my daughter Hypanthia.

Id: [0x000F4AA1]
*Crying sounds

Id: [0x000F4AA2]
What is wrong old man?

Id: [0x000F4AA3]
I will never be able to dance with my wife again.

Id: [0x000F4AA4]
I do not have the money the Temple demands for me to cast this foot on the wall.

Id: [0x000F4AA5]
Do not worry, I will help you!

Id: [0x000F4AA6]
Oh, a limb fell off, I better return it!

Id: [0x000F4AA7]
What have you done? Leave this place now!

Id: [0x000F4AA8]
There is an actual body part in that mold!!!

Id: [0x000F4AA9]
What?!? Impossible!

Id: [0x000F4AAA]
Be silent and tell me where are you stashing the molds that haven't been placed?

Id: [0x000F4AAB]
We keep them at the storage room, next  to the temple, please don't hurt me!

Id: [0x000F4AAC]
That same mark again? And look here is a list of votives he's delivered and the names of the people they are cast from. I should visit the man who makes these.”

Id: [0x000F4AAD]
This feels heavy, is there another limb inside? I should break it open.

Id: [0x000F4AAE]
All of these feel light. There is nothing inside.

Id: [0x000F4AAF]
These are just prayers from the people hoping to be cured.”

Id: [0x000F4AB0]
Interesting, but not relevant.

Id: [0x000F4AB1]
The god of healing, this is just from the temple

Id: [0x000F4AB2]
“Looks like this Aquila was deeply in love with the sculptor's daughter. But why would she burn the letter?

Id: [0x000F4AB3]
Something is glinting there, a Roman Phalera?

Id: [0x000F4AB4]
Just some broken sculptures. Nothing interesting.”

Id: [0x000F4AB5]
These are hollow again.

Id: [0x000F4AB6]
Blood? It's not a lot though, someone could have cut themselves.

Id: [0x000F4AB7]
This must be how they make the votives.

Id: [0x000F4AB8]
This delivery note has the same artisan's mark from the limb, I should find him, it says that his workshop is near the Temple.

Id: [0x000F4AB9]
The smell if more acrid here

Id: [0x000F4ABE]
What's this plant? Has someone been poisoning the water?

Id: [0x000F4ABF]
A woman talks about having relations with her young slave handmaiden.

Id: [0x000F4AC0]
What would make someone tell the whole world their darkest secrets?

Id: [0x000F4AC1]
Insensible ramblings

Id: [0x000F4AC2]
This man is talking nonsense..Is this what Praxilla mentioned, people being found babbling in the streets?

Id: [0x000F4AC3]
Some herbs and oils? This smell is very distinctive.

Id: [0x000F4AC4]
What's this? Some kind of plant leaves?

Id: [0x000F4AC5]
Someone's been telling their secrets?

Id: [0x000F4AC6]
I heared you talk about the Strix!

Id: [0x000F4AC7]
My only boy is missing! Aigolios said the Strix would take him! Please find him!

Id: [0x000F4AC8]
I will see what I can do...

Id: [0x000F4AC9]
It is fine little one. I'm not going to hurt you...

Id: [0x000F4ACA]
The bandits snatched me from the farm, I've been screaming for hours! Thank God you arrived!

Id: [0x000F4ACB]
They kept arguing about someone called Agatha? Or maybe it was Agapan...

Id: [0x000F4ACC]
...Aigolios! That was it! Funny, who would name someone "little owl"!

Id: [0x000F4ACD]
Will you be the bravest child and hurry home to your father... I have to stop the charlatan behind this!

Id: [0x000F4ACE]
Strix, eh? This surely is the work of the local cut-throats. The forest in the south looks like a perfect hideout!

Id: [0x000F4ACF]
This letter is from the Priestess, ordering the Romans to poison the river!

Id: [0x000F4AD0]
I must warn Praxilla, she might be in danger!

Id: [0x000F4AD1]
Heelp!

Id: [0x000F4AD2]
I can hear somebody up there! They've got me locked down here!

Id: [0x000F4AD3]
Somebody please help!

Id: [0x000F4AD4]
Tell me more about this Prophecy the Speaker gave you!

Id: [0x000F4AD5]
Ever since I inherited that horse-breeding farm I'm followed by bad luck!

Id: [0x000F4AD6]
Last night all my horses went missing except for one... Its throat cut...

Id: [0x000F4AD7]
Did you see me do it?!

Id: [0x000F4AD8]
It is the Strix I tell you! Aigolios warned us about it!

Id: [0x000F4AD9]
I should probably sell these cursed lands. I hope that buyer is still around...<CR><LF>

Id: [0x000F4ADA]
Something is not right here...

Id: [0x000F4ADB]
There is something in the water, I must go upstream to check it out!

Id: [0x000F4ADC]
Someone has broken the chain on the gate, deliberately.

Id: [0x000F4ADD]
Someone has broken the chain on the gate, deliberately.

Id: [0x000F4ADE]
“Whatever you do it must not be traced back to me, and don't even think about stealing from me and selling those horses. A” I wonder who A is?

Id: [0x000F4ADF]
Blood and animal parts? This is not from a horse; it looks like cow intestines.

Id: [0x000F4AE0]
A common owl feather? Someone has been planting evidence to make it look like the Strix.

Id: [0x000F4AE1]
Nothing significant about this.

Id: [0x000F4AE2]
Just ordinary feed for the horses.

Id: [0x000F4AE3]
Maybe a horse is missing a shoe.

Id: [0x000F4AE4]
Just some old leather.

Id: [0x000F4AE5]
Someone led the horses away from the farm. This is the work of people not a mythical beast. I should check the other farm.

Id: [0x000F4AE6]
It's the same horse with the missing shoe. Someone led the horses away from the farm. This is the work of people not a mythical beast I should follow them.

Id: [0x000F4AE7]
They should find their own way home, horses are smart. 

Id: [0x000F4AE8]
Get away from me! You are the cause of all my woes!

Id: [0x000F4AE9]
I'm not talking to an Egyptian.<CR><LF>

Id: [0x000F4AEA]
I sold my farm, the Strix got what it wanted.<CR><LF>

Id: [0x000F4AEB]
Could be signs of a struggle? Or someone just broke a pot.

Id: [0x000F4AEC]
I hope this is not the boys.

Id: [0x000F4AED]
A common owl feather? Someone has been planting evidence to make it look like the Strix.

Id: [0x000F4AEE]
Just the farmer's harvest.

Id: [0x000F4AEF]
Someone was learning their letters.

Id: [0x000F4AF0]
Just farming implements.

Id: [0x000F4AF1]
A horse with a missing shoe? I should check the other farm for clues.

Id: [0x000F4AF2]
(HorseFarm_Investigated) It's the same horse with the missing shoe. Someone used the horses to kidnap the boy. This is the work of people not a mythical beast I should follow them.

Id: [0x000F4AF3]
I am here to see...

Id: [0x000F4AF4]
Aigolios... He left for the ruins of the stone stars .

Id: [0x000F4AF5]
I had another vision about the Eagle, stranger...

Id: [0x000F4AF6]
The ruins of the three temples will point to the black rock from which the Eagle will emerge with a Spear!

Id: [0x000F4AF7]
The Eagle shall be the Keeper of the relic!

Id: [0x000F4AF8]
...and don't you worry about the Strix, Zeus will reward him!

Id: [0x000F4AF9]
Someone has been deliberately poisoning the water here. And there are Roman tracks. 

Id: [0x000F4AFA]
I might find out who is responsible at that suspicious looking tower.

Id: [0x000F4AFB]
Could this be what is affecting the people?

Id: [0x000F4B00]
This looks like the black rock from the Oracle's Prophecy. I should probably do some digging there!

Id: [0x000F4B01]
Through this sequence, Praxilla will comment on Bayek, burning the library.

Id: [0x000F4B02]
These ruins remind me of the words of the Oracle...

Id: [0x000F4B03]
The three ruins from the past shall point me to the Eagle... 

Id: [0x000F4B04]
Looks like the Roman's took Praxilla to this Shrine of Whispers in the mountains!

Id: [0x000F4B05]
I must hurry, Praxilla is in danger!

Id: [0x000F4B06]
Hmm..These ruins...The black Eagle rock must be nearby...

Id: [0x000F4B07]
Bayek unties Praxilla, she is unharmed but very grateful to see him.

Id: [0x000F4B08]
She tells him Melitta is the spy and Bayek says he knows. He tells her about the poison and people spilling their secrets. 

Id: [0x000F4B09]
She also tells Bayek that Melitta's Library holds secrets on many of the people of the region and must be destroyed. 

Id: [0x000F4B17]
* Bayek talks to the prisoner and asks him if he saw the Romans with a young girl.

Id: [0x000F4B18]
* He tells Bayek that a beautiful woman told the Roman commander to take the girl ‘into the belly of Atlas'

Id: [0x000F4B19]
The prisoner doesn't really know anything except that the Commander came in here and told his jailer, a rather sadistic Roman soldier by the name of Drucius to take his orders to the reinforcements around Balagrae.

Id: [0x000F4B1C]
Stay low and follow me!

Id: [0x000F4B1D]
Bayek? Saved by my childhood hero, incredible, it has been so long.

Id: [0x000F4B33]
Looks like a piece of the dioptra.

Id: [0x000F4B34]
I wonder what happened to these animals.

Id: [0x000F4B35]
A letter from the Romans, seems they are warning of bandit attacks on the road.

Id: [0x000F4B36]
There is a piece of torn papyrus under this cart.

Id: [0x000F4B37]
A crumpled letter.

Id: [0x000F4B38]
Just ordinary Silphium.

Id: [0x000F4B39]
There are carts here, but none have the farmer's mark on them.

Id: [0x000F4B3A]
Just ordinary tax records.

Id: [0x000F4B3B]
A ledger with logs of all the carts and where they are. Several carts never arrived.

Id: [0x000F4B3C]
The farmer is not the only one whose tax has gone missing.

Id: [0x000F4B3D]
Looks like someone is trying to cover it up. Is someone is hiding embezzlement?

Id: [0x000F4B44]
This here is Kleitos' cart. It was supposed to come a day ago but I am late.

Id: [0x000F4B45]
Let me see... yes, thank you for driving it here. I will check it in.

Id: [0x000F4B46]
Be sure to do that. I heard some Darius from around had some trouble.

Id: [0x000F4B47]
I don't want you to have trouble, too.

Id: [0x000F4B48]
...

Id: [0x000F4B49]
Yes sir, sure! I don't know what you mean!

Id: [0x000F4B4A]
Are you the one who is taking in the carts with taxes?

Id: [0x000F4B4B]
I want to ask about a specific one - the cart of one Kleitos

Id: [0x000F4B4C]
Yes, I am the one. I need to check the logs.

Id: [0x000F4B4D]
Kleitos, you say?

Id: [0x000F4B4E]
He never brought the tax. Are you Kleitos?

Id: [0x000F4B4F]
No, I was asked by him to see if the cart reached the depot.

Id: [0x000F4B50]
Well. You can report to him that it didn't.

Id: [0x000F4B51]
See... Don't tell anyone I told you... But there is an increased number of bandit pillages lately.

Id: [0x000F4B52]
It wouldn't surprise me if they managed to steal the cart along the way.

Id: [0x000F4B53]
We got 2 patrols missing already... But shush, I didn't tell you that.

Id: [0x000F4B54]
Do you know where they attack?

Id: [0x000F4B55]
The last patrol went just north of Balagrae. This is all I know.

Id: [0x000F4B56]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000F4B58]
I believed you when you said you cared for the Siwans here. And all the while there are more at the citadel, forced to work on a weapon you created!

Id: [0x000F4B5B]
It is not what you think. Walk with me and we'll get to the bottom of this.

Id: [0x000F4B5C]
Vitruvius! Why are there Siwans at the Citadel? My people, being forced to work on a weapon you created.

Id: [0x000F4B5E]
What? No, no. One problem at a time my friend. When the dioptra is recovered we can talk more about the Citadel.

Id: [0x000F4BA0]
Boy! What are you accused of?

Id: [0x000F4BA1]
I was charged with ferrying two gold Sobeks to Krokodilopolis. Just out of port, my ship sank by the lighthouse. I almost drowned.

Id: [0x000F4BA6]
The statues were lost. I didn't steal them!

Id: [0x000F4BE2]
This must be the ruined tower the madman spoke about. Not all of his story was insanity, then.

Id: [0x000F4CB9]
But one day, I hope to return to Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F4CD1]
Seems the only name not crossed of that list is the Hermit.

Id: [0x000F4CD2]
You must be the Hermit

Id: [0x000F4CD3]
I spose I am, and who are you ?

Id: [0x000F4CD4]
A friend, I have been sent here by Khati, the romans are looking for you, you must hide.

Id: [0x000F4CD5]
HA! They've been after me my whole life, and never caught me. Since you're here I might as well give you some training...

Id: [0x000F4CD6]
Hello little friend, why are you chasing this cow around?

Id: [0x000F4CD7]
Our father went to the market, me and my sister are in charge of the farm and we're trying to get these cows inside...

Id: [0x000F4CD8]
What's the problem with the cows ?

Id: [0x000F4CD9]
We fed them this morning and forgot to close the gate and now they're loose on the silphium fields.

Id: [0x000F4CDA]
My sister is also trying to round the rest of them up, but they love silphium and we're having trouble bringing them back in.

Id: [0x000F4CDB]
Don't worry little friend, I'll help you round them up and get them back inside.

Id: [0x000F4CDC]
Help me mister, I must get these cows inside before the Romans come, they're eating all the silphium and if the soldiers notice we will be in big trouble...

Id: [0x000F4CDD]
Okay, what do I have to do?

Id: [0x000F4CDE]
*Roman patrols incoming*

Id: [0x000F4CDF]
I'll hold off the soldiers, you get those cows inside!

Id: [0x000F4CE0]
Who knew trying to help herd some cows ends up in driving a cart full of dead bodies...

Id: [0x000F4CE1]
Where to dispose of them now... the sea is quite big.

Id: [0x000F4CE2]
Fire burns through all, also a good option with all this lying around...

Id: [0x000F4CE3]
Or i can always leave them outside one of the Roman forts. 'Courtesy of your friends in Egypt' has a funny ring to it....

Id: [0x000F4CF8]
Vitruvius! Diocles told me you were attacked!

Id: [0x000F4CF9]
On my way to the citadel. Some accursed marauders took my manuscript, my life's work, De Architecture.

Id: [0x000F4CFA]
These are dangerous times, but I would not take bandits for scholars?

Id: [0x000F4CFF]
(laughs) I'm sure they had already started using it to improve their rattrap! Thank you my friend, I will dedicate a chapter to you.

Id: [0x000F4D01]
I am honored. Actually my friend Diocles is very interested in reading it. I said we would meet him at the Oracle Shrine.

Id: [0x000F4D02]
Bayek, I did not think I would see you again! But I heard, Flavius is no more.

Id: [0x000F4D03]
It was a day I had long wished for. But how has it been in Balagrae?

Id: [0x000F4D04]
The Romans are co-operating more now that Melitta is gone.

Id: [0x000F4D05]
I will find him, if you will go to the Oracle Shrine? There is a friend there who would like to see you.

Id: [0x000F4D8D]
Cheater!! Your ox is ox-ier than mine!! No fair!

Id: [0x000F4D8E]
Bull!!! You cheated!!!

Id: [0x000F4DFA]
The best way out is through.

Id: [0x000F5016]
How could you think I would take the smallest risk with our child?

Id: [0x000F5019]
Perhaps we forgot some part of the ritual…

Id: [0x000F501D]
They kept me tied up... fed me little but crusts of bread fit for beggars...

Id: [0x000F5037]
This must have been the cell they held Istellah in. She killed the guard. Such a strong child.

Id: [0x000F5039]
Pssst! You! The tall one! Over here.

Id: [0x000F503A]
Istellah? I see you have an escape route planned out.

Id: [0x000F503B]
You understand. Now climb on the cart, and drive us out of here.

Id: [0x000F5083]
I found it in a bandit camp above the aqueduct.

Id: [0x000F5084]
Really? Some of my workers complained of hearing whispers from there, believed it was haunted. I was sure it was just superstitious nonsense.

Id: [0x000F5086]
Excellent and now General Agrippa has no more reason to bully my workers. He's become more ambitious since Flavius returned from Siwa and it is not a welcome change.

Id: [0x000F5096]
Looks like this is an inside job. Darius needs to pay off his gambling debts and it looks like he's delivering carts to the bandits in the north camp. I should go there and get the cart back.

Id: [0x000F50E6]
What's the story with the beat up Egyptian? By the Captain's tent. He looks half dead.

Id: [0x000F50E7]
He's the servant of the Greek we're looking for. The Captain persuaded him to give up his master's location.

Id: [0x000F50E8]
He's not done yet, either. He'll eventually tell him everything else he knows.

Id: [0x000F50F6]
So, now they send a son of Egypt against me? It has been a long time since I spilled so much blood.

Id: [0x000F50F8]
I was sent by Apollodorus. We share a common interest.

Id: [0x000F50FA]
Who are you and what do you want, eh?

Id: [0x000F50FB]
I'm Bayek of Siwa. And I seek information on The Crocodile.

Id: [0x000F50FC]
The phantom that has brought Faiyum to its knees? What could you want with him?

Id: [0x000F50FE]
He belongs to a group that is destroying Egypt. I intend to hunt every last one of them down.

Id: [0x000F5100]
Then you are looking for the same thing these soldiers were.

Id: [0x000F5101]
And what would that be?

Id: [0x000F5102]
I stole a ledger from a Greek magistrate I suspect of corruption. It should reveal the identity of this "Crocodile".

Id: [0x000F5103]
And if we get it to Apollodorus, we may be able to bring down the whole organization.

Id: [0x000F5104]
Where's the ledger now?

Id: [0x000F5105]
I gave it to my wife Khenut to hide. As long as the Ptolemies think it's with me, my family is safe. That is why I have to stay on the move.

Id: [0x000F5107]
Here, this will tell Khenut you are a friend to be trusted. It is for my daughter Shadya.

Id: [0x000F5108]
Once you have the ledger, find me at the docks, south of Euhemeria.

Id: [0x000F510F]
Khenut?

Id: [0x000F5110]
Yes?

Id: [0x000F5111]
I instructed our most loyal servant to hide it in our villa. They can search the place as many times as they want. They will never find it.

Id: [0x000F5112]
Can you take me there?

Id: [0x000F5113]
I have been summoned to the lighthouse for another of their "routine investigations".

Id: [0x000F5114]
That may not be safe. The Ptolemaic authorities seem to be working with the Crocodile.

Id: [0x000F5115]
It happens every few days. Don't worry. They wouldn't dare touch someone in an official position.

Id: [0x000F512C]
None of that will bring Shadya back.

Id: [0x000F512D]
But at least you'll have the comfort of revenge. We both will.

Id: [0x000F512E]
I hope so. I will do anything I can to help you, brother.

Id: [0x000F512F]
Has Khenut been able to tell you anything?

Id: [0x000F5153]
I am sorry I left you to fight alone, but I hear you did me proud?

Id: [0x000F5154]
Felix sent you out on a job? Who was it for?

Id: [0x000F5156]
I'll tell you everything in good time, brother. Just know that our future has never looked brighter!

Id: [0x000F5158]
Bayek. This is the moment we've longed for. Our chance to seize the mantle of champions. Felix awaits!

Id: [0x000F515E]
The girl by the lighthouse? We didn't kill her, I swear!

Id: [0x000F515F]
We have done many terrible things, Siwan. But the murder of the child is not one of them.

Id: [0x000F5160]
We were there, it's true. We saw the soldiers capture the girl and take her to Berenike. To… to the Crocodile.

Id: [0x000F5161]
It was she who drowned the child. Took a book from her, ordered a stone tied to her ankles and pushed her in the water. There was nothing we could do.

Id: [0x000F5164]
This is the real reason you came to me, isn't it? To uncover this patron. This "Crocodile."

Id: [0x000F5165]
Bayek, why didn't you confide in me, huh? I would have helped you.

Id: [0x000F5166]
You're a mercenary, just like them. I couldn't take the chance!

Id: [0x000F5167]
No, Bayek. You know me better than…

Id: [0x000F5169]
Bayek, you have to know!

Id: [0x000F517C]
Ah, here's the vlaka who's been messing with my business. We were just discussing you.

Id: [0x000F517E]
You've been stealing grain from Faiyum… starving people for profit.

Id: [0x000F517F]
You're not from Faiyum, are you? Your speech reeks of the countryside.

Id: [0x000F5180]
You naive backwater malakia. I take orders from above. If not me, someone else will do this.

Id: [0x000F5183]
Who else did I have left?

Id: [0x000F5188]
This is the Lizard's work.

Id: [0x000F518F]
And so I must stain my hands with another priest's blood.

Id: [0x000F5192]
Hiding inside our palace, these silacious curs, these ROMANS, occupying our very space for our GODS! Our whole way of life is under threat while any Roman is in this city, let ALONE in our palace. They are being hosted by that usurper Cleopatra whilst they restrained our KING! We must purge the toxic Roman influence from our glorious city! Come, rise with me, Make Alexandria ours once more!

Id: [0x000F5194]
And I just left them! My poor oxen! Everything I owned! What-what am I to do?

Id: [0x000F5199]
Look how much you've done since I've been gone.

Id: [0x000F519A]
I found something strange inside the house. It arouses my curiosity, and yet terrifies me. W-will you look?

Id: [0x000F519C]
You would clear a house in no time.

Id: [0x000F519D]
You are wasting your time, but as you will.

Id: [0x000F519F]
Where is this temple?

Id: [0x000F51A0]
Stop, Mereruka! I beg you.

Id: [0x000F51A2]
Some ancient concoction, long since dried up.

Id: [0x000F51A4]
I serve the ways of old Egypt.[Coughs]

Id: [0x000F51A8]
It is will that drives me, not fear.

Id: [0x000F51A9]
Oh, yes? And who passes the whip over your back? Who demands that you stain your ka with my death?

Id: [0x000F51C9]
Are you serious?

Id: [0x000F51CA]
I would spend the ring's money on my family. Do you have any idea how many children I have!? Guess!

Id: [0x000F51FF]
Shh! They will kill me if they hear us!

Id: [0x000F5201]
I-I cannot move!

Id: [0x000F5207]
Hush your racket, auntie. You will just make the hippos excited. Or call the bandits back.

Id: [0x000F524D]
It's Barbaric, that's what! 

Id: [0x000F524E]
Have you become simple? What do you think they are doing? If we don't strike them first they will do it to us. Rather them then us. 

Id: [0x000F524F]
We are the city of knowledge of understanding. We don't do such acts of horror and promote it in our gardens.

Id: [0x000F5258]
Thank you. I'll head north.

Id: [0x000F5267]
A priest in a blue sash brought my orders.

Id: [0x000F5268]
He did this to me. He threatened to do the same to my daughter.

Id: [0x000F5292]
Are you ordering me away from a fight?

Id: [0x000F5293]
We're not here to protect Pompey. We're here to bribe him.

Id: [0x000F5294]
You put it bluntly, but yes.

Id: [0x000F5295]
She's paying you as well, Phoxidas. Handsomely, some might say.

Id: [0x000F52C4]
That grain belongs on Egyptian tables.

Id: [0x000F52C7]
This is business. People pay what they owe, or I take it. It's not personal. I give you a choice now. Leave me alone and live, or die here.

Id: [0x000F5309]
Let me talk to your husband. Where can I find him?

Id: [0x000F530A]
He's a stonemason working near the temple. Please be careful. The soldiers mustn't see you talk to him!

Id: [0x000F530C]
Here are the contenders to the crown! The Guardians of Siwa!

Id: [0x000F530D]
Undefeated! Unmatched! It's the Gallic Brothers!

Id: [0x000F530E]
Meet Suphia by the northern entrance. You will find her there at night.

Id: [0x000F532D]
We are lucky Nefertari allows these deals. She has a pure heart. Risks her neck. The mine belongs to the regime after all.

Id: [0x000F5346]
Good to see you Namrut!

Id: [0x000F5348]
How kind of them to come forth! Let us welcome them, shall we? Warmly. With a ball of flaming refuse! Alalalala!

Id: [0x000F5352]
Careful! Aghh!

Id: [0x000F5353]
Cold...I am so cold...

Id: [0x000F536A]
By my sacred oath. Forgive me!

Id: [0x000F536E]
You seem uneasy, Namrut. Why the hesitance?

Id: [0x000F536F]
I don't like straying from the plan. These lands are teeming with dangers. Bandits. Soldiers. The wild.

Id: [0x000F5370]
We are not fighting men. You can take the bounty off my head.

Id: [0x000F537B]
I am sorry, it is just... He was such a gentle soul, once had me treat a wounded dog he had caught in a snare... Why would he do this?

Id: [0x000F537E]
I have seen this before, in Siwa. I'm looking for the soul-eater responsible. Flavius.

Id: [0x000F5381]
That sack of rancid goat shit murdered my son, razed my village and now marches through your land with the light of Amun-Ra...

Id: [0x000F538A]
Now I see. You're Rudjek's mistress. Well, your fucking lover killed my son. I feel nothing for you.

Id: [0x000F538B]
You're meant to die!

Id: [0x000F538C]
Take care of your eagle. Roman hunters capture every beast they find.

Id: [0x000F5397]
What port are you taking us to?

Id: [0x000F5398]
From there it's a half day's ride to Rome.

Id: [0x000F539E]
Talk!

Id: [0x000F53A1]
Eager, old man. Eager to be done with the scum. And move on to the next pile of scum.

Id: [0x000F53A4]
Death drives us to do things we regret.

Id: [0x000F53A7]
You best be on your way.

Id: [0x000F53AF]
Do stay out of trouble, will you?

Id: [0x000F53B2]
The past is the past. You and I have started anew.

Id: [0x000F53C5]
Believe me, you would be sorry. Now let's end this!

Id: [0x000F53C7]
Surely this chapter will be the most widely read of all!

Id: [0x000F53EC]
That warrior will find the Book!

Id: [0x000F53ED]
Yes, yes. He will find it.

Id: [0x000F564E]
That's... a nice toy.

Id: [0x000F56D1]
Well, that was a fetching display! How would you like something steady? Just look strong and take care of any trouble. You will be well looked after.

Id: [0x000F56D5]
I pray you get the justice you seek, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F56EE]
When you arrive in Cyrene, look for my friend Diocles. I would trust him with my life, and yours. As a magistrate he hears petitioners in the Agora....

Id: [0x000F56FA]
The proconsul?

Id: [0x000F5708]
They stood in his path.

Id: [0x000F5729]
I have heard the stories!

Id: [0x000F572A]
A guide will show you your new house. You have but to dig it free, and to help with the public works, to be welcome here.

Id: [0x000F573B]
It looks better, Neb. I will have one of my aids bring something for the pain.

Id: [0x000F573C]
And my brother?

Id: [0x000F573D]
Recovering. He needs rest.

Id: [0x000F574C]
In their eyes Taharqa's project would be sacrilegious.

Id: [0x000F57D0]
Hung out to dry like rags. No wonder the place is locked tight. Hiding the murder of gods!

Id: [0x000F57D1]
These mummies are sloppy work. This is the foulest blasphemy!

Id: [0x000F57D2]
That is a lot of gold. Someone is making a big profit from this sacrilege.

Id: [0x000F57D3]
The mummies are stuffed with gold and valuables. Where are they taking them? There are shipping consignment markings on them.

Id: [0x000F57D4]
I don't want to do this. But you put your nose where it doesn't belong, priest.

Id: [0x000F57D5]
You know this is wrong. Wrong! Killing Sobek's children? Filling their bodies with unclean gold? Who orders such bloodshed and sacrilege?

Id: [0x000F57D6]
Sobek has chosen his right hand, and we must obey him. I'm sorry. I will make this quick.

Id: [0x000F57D7]
You cannot shed innocent blood! You are meant to protect the temple and the people!

Id: [0x000F57D8]
Someone is in trouble!

Id: [0x000F57FA]
The ship's manifest. The cargo is bound for the Trireme Stranding Camp to the West.

Id: [0x000F57FB]
More evidence the cult is working with Ptolemy's soldiers. Money, power, and corruption. It is always the same.

Id: [0x000F57FC]
Why would Sobek priests be dealing with soldiers?

Id: [0x000F57FD]
I need to go to that camp and find out more.

Id: [0x000F581D]
This is the Trireme Stranding Camp. The information I need is probably in the Captain's tent.

Id: [0x000F582D]
It will be done.

Id: [0x000F5830]
One more oppressor. Egypt will never be stable again. Invasions upon invasions. Flavius will make of Egypt one giant tomb.

Id: [0x000F5836]
He rules from the Acropolis, but it's crawling with Romans.

Id: [0x000F5849]
And dearly, by the balls of Zeus! I want the oceans turned dark with their blood! Damastes! Make the call, increase the rhythm!

Id: [0x000F584A]
Ptolemy's malakia are not dead yet! Get onto reed boats. Use the fog to hide your escape.

Id: [0x000F584B]
You look well. Better than the last time I found you. Are you just... better... at killing now?

Id: [0x000F58BD]
As long as he stays away from me.

Id: [0x000F58D6]
I would prefer to appease them. Thank you for the warning, [Wab](Pure One).

Id: [0x000F5905]
We go along the canal.

Id: [0x000F5906]
You lead. I will fake it.

Id: [0x000F5910]
Thank you Medjay! My life is spared, but it seems much that is good is already dead.

Id: [0x000F5911]
I saw the tannery and the mummies. I know what they are doing to Sobek's children.

Id: [0x000F5914]
So you have seen it? Dua Sobek! It is unthinkable. I am Padiaset. I serve in the temple South of the city.

Id: [0x000F5915]
This is going to take more than prayer, priest. We need to act. The mummies had markings on them. I think they are being moved by ship.

Id: [0x000F5916]
Ship? The cult has a trireme. It follows trade routes South of the city. Do what you must, Medjay. I will pray for you. But please, risk no more bloodshed.

Id: [0x000F5926]
You'll do what you're told, you lazy shit. If you need more grain, grow more. It's not my problem.

Id: [0x000F592C]
Captain!

Id: [0x000F592E]
These crocodile mummies are getting heavier. Offerings must be increasing. They can't stuff much more into their little bodies.

Id: [0x000F592F]
Isn't what we're doing sacrilege, though? I cannot believe this is what that priest would want.

Id: [0x000F5930]
Wealth means expansion for the temple and money for us. Sobek's influence is spreading. Isn't that the point?

Id: [0x000F5931]
True. We all benefit. Leave the moral questions for the priests.

Id: [0x000F5934]
I will see you soon, Official.

Id: [0x000F594D]
Shadya, my lotus. No other will suffer as you did, I swear it. Goodbye, my little tadpole. Swim forever free.

Id: [0x000F5952]
My husband, we must shake off our grief. We cannot let others suffer too. Not when we can stop it. You were a fighter once. It is time to fight again.

Id: [0x000F5955]
Correspondence between the Captain and a priest named Sehetep. The cult and Ptolemy's soldiers are conspiring together. What else are they doing?

Id: [0x000F5958]
I know you're not extorting grain from this farmer. Because you'd know that would be violating several Egyptian laws. As officials of Faiyum, we both know it. Don't we?

Id: [0x000F5988]
They'd marked Khenut for death. Death found them first.

Id: [0x000F5989]
I envy them. Well, it had to be done. These soldiers do not seem to understand anything else.

Id: [0x000F598A]
There's more. The captain was under orders. I found this insignia on him. Do you know it?

Id: [0x000F598B]
Yes. This is not good. It is from Fort Boubastos, to the east. Run by another malakia who thinks himself untouchable.

Id: [0x000F598D]
Khenut was right. People will continue to suffer unless we act. Bayek, I am sorry to ask this. We need your help.

Id: [0x000F598E]
You have it. There's something I must do first, though. I will return soon.

Id: [0x000F5991]
[waking-up noise]

Id: [0x000F5994]
I am not here to live in these tough sands.

Id: [0x000F5995]
A key carved with the Eye of Horus. What could it unlock?

Id: [0x000F5996]
Another key, same as the first.

Id: [0x000F5997]
A third key. Must be part of a set.

Id: [0x000F5998]
The last key, eh? Maybe I'll pay that "sad fishing village" a visit.

Id: [0x000F59AF]
I cannot shed my past like a snake sheds his skin.

Id: [0x000F59B5]
A dog? Wounded too. I better take a look at its wounds.

Id: [0x000F59B6]
[Bayek fixes the dog's paws.]

Id: [0x000F59B7]
There we are. I should follow it. It's master can't be very far.

Id: [0x000F59BB]
Look at me. No, you're unwell.

Id: [0x000F59BC]
I am alright.

Id: [0x000F59BD]
You just spat up your meal and you can barely stand straight.

Id: [0x000F59BE]
Just bring me some water.

Id: [0x000F59BF]
No, the water is dirty. It cannot be drunk.

Id: [0x000F59C1]
I'm looking for your grandfather. Do you know where he went?

Id: [0x000F59C2]
We will get something for your stomach.

Id: [0x000F59C4]
Go find someone else to munch on! Damned hyenas!

Id: [0x000F59C5]
Cries for help coming from that mastaba. I should intervene.

Id: [0x000F59DF]
They're attacking the ruins again!

Id: [0x000F59E0]
The world is made by great men dreaming big. What do you dream of, Bayek?

Id: [0x000F59E4]
You should be fine, all the hyenas are dead.

Id: [0x000F59E5]
Thank you. Damned animals.

Id: [0x000F59E6]
Thank your dog. I probably wouldn't have found you otherwise.

Id: [0x000F59E7]
Inpu lead you here? He must've run away at the first sign of danger.

Id: [0x000F59E8]
What are you doing all the way out here? Looking for valuables in the ruins?

Id: [0x000F59E9]
I left Memphis to find a friend that left to join bandits.

Id: [0x000F59EA]
Trouble is brewing in Memphis, we need him back.

Id: [0x000F59EB]
He joined a band of bandits to the south. Find him and bring him to the pigeon tower across the river.

Id: [0x000F59ED]
What did you do that for? The children of Memphis need the money and I provide!

Id: [0x000F59EE]
What they need is for you to be in Memphis and help. They look up to you.

Id: [0x000F59EF]
I can't stop my ventures with the snap of a finger. Besides, the gang won't let me leave just like that.

Id: [0x000F59F0]
There is an other way. I read from the letters sent through here that ptolemies in the nearby camps carry money. If we can extort one, it'd be a steady source of income.

Id: [0x000F59F1]
And if your old friends come and bother you, I'll take care of them.

Id: [0x000F59F2]
It's settled then!

Id: [0x000F59F3]
Listen, you degenerate piece of greek filth. Every week, you'll hand us half of what you collect and stash it at a drop point.

Id: [0x000F59F4]
Whatever you say! Just, please, don't kill me!

Id: [0x000F59F5]
We're all done here. Let's join up with your friend.

Id: [0x000F5A03]
We are on our way, old friend! After all this time! I might finally get my shot at the Gallic brothers. And it's thanks to you.

Id: [0x000F5A04]
I would like nothing more. What about these other contracts you mentioned earlier?

Id: [0x000F5A05]
Oh the righteous Bayek, is willing to dirty his hands? Times have changed, seni. I suppose it is hard to be a Medjay, all the time.

Id: [0x000F5A06]
You willl have to ask Felix about those… quietly.

Id: [0x000F5A0B]
So, you are feeling good. Planning your ride to the top.

Id: [0x000F5A0C]
Trust me, what we do… it's not noble. We are mercenaries, that's all.

Id: [0x000F5A0D]
Mercenaries? Swords for hire by the wealthy?

Id: [0x000F5A0E]
Yes. So you heard. My advice - refuse the offers. It's a slippery dune.

Id: [0x000F5A0F]
I have seen… good men die. Just fight and go home. Don't do the contracts.

Id: [0x000F5A14]
An impressive first outing, Siwan. I'm a little jealous.

Id: [0x000F5A15]
I need a faster way to make coin. I've heard fighters are offered work outside the arena.

Id: [0x000F5A16]
You're quick to learn secrets, my friend. We are not supposed to talk about it. But opportunities come along from time to time. I think I might have just proven myself worthy.

Id: [0x000F5A17]
Do you know who the contracts come from?

Id: [0x000F5A18]
There is a reason these people operate in shadow. No one knows their identity. Take my advice. If you're lucky enough to be chosen, do what you're asked to, and be thankful for the money.

Id: [0x000F5A34]
He was asking for it. We can't have these sand-rat Egyptians getting brave. Now hurry! This shipment goes to Dromos' holy corridor tomorrow.

Id: [0x000F5A35]
I've never taken a man's arm before. Did you see how clean the cut was? Right through the bone. That's talent.

Id: [0x000F5A36]
Haha! Gods, did he scream. Not one farmer will have the guts to resist now.

Id: [0x000F5A3B]
Yet crocodiles may still be defeated. The Captain is no more. Rise, seni. Spread the word.

Id: [0x000F5A3E]
You defeated the Captain? Wow, you are a madman! [Pause] Okay, if you are willing to do this, I will join you. I will spread the word, seni.

Id: [0x000F5A40]
I must find Vesta's house

Id: [0x000F5A57]
I did not want the responsibility here in Faiyum. The inheritance was forced on me. I wanted to stay on my ship, the adventure... Now I realize... giving up is a choice... and I am still alive.

Id: [0x000F5A5A]
They must be in the villa. Take the back! You, come with me.

Id: [0x000F5A5B]
Soldiers!

Id: [0x000F5A5C]
Yes, sir!

Id: [0x000F5AA5]
Where are you, malakia? Come down. We need a talk.

Id: [0x000F5AAE]
I've got your back!

Id: [0x000F5AB0]
And it's good to have you back, brother!

Id: [0x000F5AB7]
A dead Hippopotamus.

Id: [0x000F5AB8]
These people were trampled to death.

Id: [0x000F5AB9]
This house is falling apart from strong collisions.

Id: [0x000F5ABA]
A Hippopotamus footprint.

Id: [0x000F5ABB]
This tent was broken by a strong force.

Id: [0x000F5ABC]
They were crushed repeatedly.

Id: [0x000F5ABD]
Footprints of a herd of Hippopotamuses.

Id: [0x000F5ABE]
Trampled to death.

Id: [0x000F5ABF]
Must have died when the building collapsed.

Id: [0x000F5AC1]
If the gods are responsible, I will kneel beside you as they strike us down.

Id: [0x000F5AC2]
You're not getting off that easy! Get 'em!

Id: [0x000F5AC3]
You may take my life, but you may never take my freedom!

Id: [0x000F5AC4]
Sorry, I had to leave. I was getting light headed looking at that dreadful sight. 

Id: [0x000F5AC5]
It's fine, steady yourself. It's a sign of times to come. 

Id: [0x000F5AC6]
I know, I just need a second to get my breath back. 

Id: [0x000F5AC7]
Here we are, home at last.

Id: [0x000F5AC8]
Thank you Bayek, we couldn't have done it without you.

Id: [0x000F5AC9]
You should talk with our leader, he might have some use for you.

Id: [0x000F5ACA]
I will. You keep your nose clean and you keep an eye on him. Farewell!

Id: [0x000F5ACF]
Tefibi, you will be the death of me.

Id: [0x000F5AD0]
No, mother, I will be your salvation. No more olives! No more payment to rent a press!

Id: [0x000F5AD1]
Pay attention to what you have in front of you, idiot boy! Not the mirage you see in the distance.

Id: [0x000F5AD2]
But what a mirage, mother! The white linens of a philosopher, and with that, drachmas!

Id: [0x000F5AD3]
Coins would come from the papyrus you lost! Are you sure this is where you lost it?

Id: [0x000F5AD4]
I already told you! The papyrus was taken from me!

Id: [0x000F5AE6]
This must be the boat that Tefibi spoke of.

Id: [0x000F5AE9]
These guards will know better than to trouble Tefibi from now on.

Id: [0x000F5AEB]
Your offering. Now you can return to selling your olive oil.

Id: [0x000F5AF0]
... Allow Tefibi his chance. He'll be all right.

Id: [0x000F5B16]
Medjay! Mother no longer squashes olives all day... Thanks to the Great Philosopher Tefibi.

Id: [0x000F5B17]
All this thanks to you, and my papyrus! Platonic tour on the house?

Id: [0x000F5B18]
Maybe next time.

Id: [0x000F5B19]
I will spit on the Queen if I get close enough!

Id: [0x000F5B71]
The silence is striking.

Id: [0x000F5B74]
Better for seeing your face.

Id: [0x000F5B75]
There's a strangeness in your eyes. What afflicts you?

Id: [0x000F5B77]
Her Seer claims that her poisoner is our enemy.

Id: [0x000F5B99]
As they rule, the gods curse our land, withholding the river's floods.

Id: [0x000F5C04]
I cannot lose them. They must know my voice as that of the goddess.

Id: [0x000F5C05]
My Queen...

Id: [0x000F5C19]
Leave this in my hands, Priest.

Id: [0x000F5C24]
Then get me out of here, Medjay!

Id: [0x000F5C2B]
I cannot help but think you seem cheerful for a man unable to walk.

Id: [0x000F5C4F]
This is the skin? Oh, this poor beast. Blue is no color for a lion.

Id: [0x000F5C58]
Peace, Theon! He claims to not have stolen a thing. Do you wish Serapis displeased with you?

Id: [0x000F5C59]
...No.

Id: [0x000F5C80]
My workers are so slow! I need to run over and check on them.

Id: [0x000F5C83]
Did it work?

Id: [0x000F5C84]
Yes, we've convinced the ptolemies to share some of their wealth with the needy of Memphis.

Id: [0x000F5C85]
Let's be on our way now, the children will be eager to see you!

Id: [0x000F5C86]
Not a moment too soon.

Id: [0x000F5C8E]
Where should we begin?

Id: [0x000F5CB5]
We had to save Panchrates!

Id: [0x000F5CB8]
They forced us to poison the god!

Id: [0x000F5CB9]
They told us they were going to feed our brother to crocodiles unless we...

Id: [0x000F5CC6]
Psst! Hey!

Id: [0x000F5CCE]
The Order is surely behind this.

Id: [0x000F5CD1]
Over here, seni. Yeah, you. That's right.

Id: [0x000F5CD3]
I can get you whatever you need.

Id: [0x000F5CD9]
Medjay! Great warrior, come! I sell what you want. You need it, I have it. If I don't have it, you don't need it. Reda has your back in these desolate lands.

Id: [0x000F5CE1]
You are but a boy, how did you come by such fine treasure?

Id: [0x000F5CF2]
The Order is everywhere. To protect Egypt, I would kill a thousand priests.

Id: [0x000F5CF3]
You and I are pledged to violence, now and always.

Id: [0x000F5CF6]
So?

Id: [0x000F5CF7]
My Queen, they acted only to lift the threat on their brother's life.

Id: [0x000F5D04]
You wasted your time. Sorry, we cannot help you.

Id: [0x000F5D05]
We are not asking for charity. We can offer food, supplies, and information. All we require in return is protection for our people.

Id: [0x000F5D06]
I said we cannot help. Soldiers captured our leader down at the dam.

Id: [0x000F5D09]
You are Bayek of Siwa? We were told what you did at the Arena. Beating the Gallic brothers like a madman!

Id: [0x000F5D0B]
Then perhaps we can help you. This is Bayek of Siwa--

Id: [0x000F5D0D]
And I suppose today I play the madman again.

Id: [0x000F5D13]
They love their crazy Siwan.

Id: [0x000F5D15]
The rebels also did their part. You've inspired them, Bayek. In truth, they are in awe of you. Our farms will be well protected.

Id: [0x000F5D18]
It is done.

Id: [0x000F5D1C]
They will not let another Crocodile plague the Faiyum again. Your people are free now. It is a good start.

Id: [0x000F5D21]
Shadya liked you immediately, you know. You always have a home here, if you need it.

Id: [0x000F5D23]
Hotephres. It is time to live up to your name.

Id: [0x000F5D26]
Peace, I am not your enemy.

Id: [0x000F5D2C]
Praxilla, of this land gone mad.

Id: [0x000F5D2E]
We need more information. How far does the corruption go? It may rise as far as Ptolemy's inner circle. We cannot trust any Phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F5D2F]
Most of the farmers will not talk for fear of the soldiers. But they are angry. It will not take much to convince them.

Id: [0x000F5D66]
His name was muck before you arrived.

Id: [0x000F5D6B]
Memphis is yours again.

Id: [0x000F5D6C]
Ours.

Id: [0x000F5D6E]
Eh? Who?

Id: [0x000F5D81]
Tanner lied about that skin. It's almost worthless.

Id: [0x000F5D82]
You know the Greeks.

Id: [0x000F5D83]
Wonder what skin that tanner will destroy next?

Id: [0x000F5D84]
His own. His face is leather already. Would only improve it.

Id: [0x000F5D85]
Easy enough work, stealing from him. Skins for days.

Id: [0x000F5D86]
This is better than fishing. I've yet to get the smell of crocodile out of my nose.

Id: [0x000F5DD5]
They emptied my pockets. Took my notes, too! You might want to check your pouch.

Id: [0x000F5DF5]
Trying not to be. Could you tell me anything about the men who took Anta?

Id: [0x000F5DF6]
They're big, mean, and there's a lot of them!

Id: [0x000F5DF9]
Any luck getting my book back?

Id: [0x000F5DFA]
Not yet.

Id: [0x000F5DFB]
Please, if you could do anything -- it is my life's work!

Id: [0x000F5E00]
Can you believe those kids?

Id: [0x000F5E01]
[laughs] Resourceful, aren't they? Gods, I don't know where they find some of these gems!

Id: [0x000F5E02]
[laughs] They would make good recruits!

Id: [0x000F5E03]
Some day! For now, I say we keep this going a little longer, don't you think?

Id: [0x000F5E05]
I can drink to that!

Id: [0x000F5E07]
You have come at last!

Id: [0x000F5E0C]
Behold! When stripped of the furs and fineries there is no god here, only a feeble man, who has come across the sea to usurp the divinity of our gods. <CR><LF>Reject these false occupiers. No good will happen with these Roman dogs sneaking in to steal what is ours. <CR><LF>Drag them through the streets! Hunt them down with no mercy, until they realise that Alexandria is no city for Caesar!

Id: [0x000F5E25]
This blasphemy will not stand!

Id: [0x000F5E33]
The gods have abandoned us.

Id: [0x000F5E3A]
Plucked from the ancient lands of the desert, the sunken vessels of the Nile, refined by hand maidens of the gods. Weaponry forged in Nubian mines, Persian jewels and Assyrian treasures! I have it all!

Id: [0x000F5E3E]
She says thank you!

Id: [0x000F5E41]
We'll need to feed her, first thing! She must be hungry!

Id: [0x000F5E44]
I will pray to the gods to watch over you.

Id: [0x000F5E48]
I am excited to see Memphis for myself! I have only heard stories.

Id: [0x000F5E55]
The Senate: A Brief but Intense History. Dull.

Id: [0x000F5E56]
Ah, this must be it. And the offering, inside as the boy said. I should return these.

Id: [0x000F5E57]
Tax accounts of Athens. How... interesting.

Id: [0x000F5E58]
Tax accounts of Athens. How... interesting.

Id: [0x000F5E5F]
Please, leave me to my tears.

Id: [0x000F5E61]
Neb, if you will follow me? We must give her privacy.

Id: [0x000F5E62]
Hmm. She has found a ritual of protection in an ancient scroll. Only a few ingredients remain to be--

Id: [0x000F5E63]
I'll find them.

Id: [0x000F5E64]
A lot of blood loss. This man took a while to die.

Id: [0x000F5E65]
Ok, here's the seal. They would have taken the others to the south fort. 

Id: [0x000F5E6C]
Where is the coward that did this?

Id: [0x000F5E6D]
Great cat goddess Bastet save us. Do not take vengeance!

Id: [0x000F5E88]
I would not like to be those Roman captives right now. Did you hear about what happened at the gymnaseum?

Id: [0x000F5E89]
Well at least this way it isn't public. Not too many people can get inside the south fort.

Id: [0x000F5EA1]
Halt! Who are you?

Id: [0x000F5EA2]
A man who respects his elders.

Id: [0x000F5EA3]
I know all the warrior castes. You speak like a Medjay.

Id: [0x000F5FE1]
The sword is missing. I wonder if Maahes succeeded at the house of Serqet, or whether his cause was lost there?

Id: [0x000F5FE3]
This was where Maahes fought and died at the hands of Bagoas the eunuch and Mentor the Rhodian!

Id: [0x000F5FFF]
We'll stay out here another day. If we haven't baited anyone with the trap, we'll take the oxen back and use them to feed the lions.

Id: [0x000F6000]
Those blind fools from Letopolis blister my skin!

Id: [0x000F6001]
Patience. You'll be able to play with them soon enough.

Id: [0x000F6005]
I might well be able to get in unseen.

Id: [0x000F601F]
Quiet there, let's see how you are tangled-

Id: [0x000F6021]
[ONO war cries]

Id: [0x000F6022]
Hah! Another sacrifice to the Mistress of Dread!

Id: [0x000F6023]
Spill the outsider's blood! For the Lady of Slaughter!

Id: [0x000F6026]
What did the priests hope to achieve in their last ceremony, so long ago?

Id: [0x000F6040]
I missed you.

Id: [0x000F6042]
I have news.

Id: [0x000F6044]
You are scarred by justice.

Id: [0x000F6046]
I hate that we have to do these things, but I am grateful that you did.

Id: [0x000F6047]
If I am honest, I took pleasure in it.

Id: [0x000F604D]
But I was careless. Another of the masked ones tracked me to my home. He was even more difficult.

Id: [0x000F6056]
We have one more. Then we will be done.

Id: [0x000F606B]
Here, let me help you with that.

Id: [0x000F607E]
The scribe has paid the price for treating his neighbors so poorly.

Id: [0x000F60C6]
I was visiting the docks and heard it from Aristo's wife herself!

Id: [0x000F60F2]
I see, you are well-travelled for such a young man.

Id: [0x000F60F7]
[disgusted ono] The air reeks of a thousand corpses.

Id: [0x000F60F8]
I have had two embalmers run off since it began. Only untrained laborers are free to take their place.

Id: [0x000F60F9]
Such coarse fellows! I hope to discharge them soon.

Id: [0x000F6101]
I am the Master of Secret Things, the form of the soul that rests in the heavens…

Id: [0x000F6102]
I am Servant to the Great God, who gives light exceedingly…

Id: [0x000F6103]
I am the Companion of the Flame, in whose mouth the fire is not quenched.

Id: [0x000F6104]
Grow, O light; come forth, O light…

Id: [0x000F610C]
What was that, dog?

Id: [0x000F610E]
Quiet that boy down!

Id: [0x000F6110]
Is there no end to your speech?

Id: [0x000F6115]
You want to see what a sword can do to you, scum? More than happy to demonstrate!

Id: [0x000F6124]
Ah! Freedom at last, now I can face these Romans. Bastet guide my arm.

Id: [0x000F6125]
I need to get back to Khalid. Who knows what he will do if I'm not near.

Id: [0x000F6127]
There he is. Now to get him out of the city.

Id: [0x000F612B]
Now that was exhilarating, brother! Just think of the things I could do at your side.

Id: [0x000F612C]
Or you could leave and share your passion with Bastet.

Id: [0x000F6130]
You would not call us your ally but our goals seem to be aligned from time to time, don't they?

Id: [0x000F6142]
Chief Nito, the well tunnel partially collapsed, but I was able to help the workers.

Id: [0x000F6143]
My little bean and I are so fortunate you passed by when you did, Medjay. May the gods bless you a thousand times for your efforts!

Id: [0x000F614C]
Yes, a failed attack. I am hunting Derratos, a ruthless general of Ptolemy with a hatred for Egyptians. A killer of mothers and fathers and children.

Id: [0x000F614E]
My beautiful Teta! Now I can see her face again before I die.

Id: [0x000F6151]
The next fight is tonight. Let us meet at sundown. Say at the top of the lighthouse?

Id: [0x000F617B]
I will get briefed.

Id: [0x000F617E]
What should we do?

Id: [0x000F617F]
I've learned his personal scribe has stayed behind in Karanis.

Id: [0x000F6187]
We'll break your fingers. Then your wrists. Your arms!

Id: [0x000F6188]
No! No, don't!

Id: [0x000F6189]
Where's Derratos?

Id: [0x000F618C]
You can find the other rebels just west of Soknopaiou.

Id: [0x000F61A1]
Derratos embodies the unjust. He is why I am who I am. I need you, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F61A5]
You remember now...

Id: [0x000F61A7]
May the Field of Reeds elude you always.

Id: [0x000F61B1]
His men laughed, but Derratos was furious. I watched as my father was hanged from his own tree and picked at by every animal in the region.

Id: [0x000F61B3]
One season, the harvest was so poor that my father struggled to give his cut.

Id: [0x000F61B9]
Save your blessings. There will be more battles to win.

Id: [0x000F61C4]
Bastard! Neket iadet!

Id: [0x000F61C6]
That was Rudjek's wife. Did you expect anything less?

Id: [0x000F61D0]
Unfortunately, I am accounted for. Would you consider a genuine arena champion? Hilarus here was a favorite of Pompey's.

Id: [0x000F61D1]
You are a little old, but you cut a good figure. Do you still have it in you?

Id: [0x000F61D2]
Come, then. We shall discuss the terms privately.

Id: [0x000F61D4]
Do I-- Madam, I am Hilarus. Youth is a state of mind. You will be more than satisfied! If my charge releases me.

Id: [0x000F61D6]
Training? Listen old man…

Id: [0x000F61EB]
Redcloaks and that milksop with the Lion's head. Took anyone who could work, farmhands, my son Kade. Everyone. Then He came.

Id: [0x000F61ED]
Dark eyes, hooded as a raven. I wanted to throw stones to shoo him off. Something golden, bright in his claws. Held it up, crowing as they fell before him. Some by their own hands, others by those dearest to them. Against nature. Everyone crying, screaming, running, dying.

Id: [0x000F61EF]
The men who did this... We will find them.

Id: [0x000F61F0]
Better hurry, girl. Raven flew north to the home of the huntress, overheard redcloaks squawking. Bring Kade back to me?

Id: [0x000F61F1]
I will try. Flavius also robbed me of my boy.

Id: [0x000F629C]
Ooof, your hands. The cracks and calluses are getting worse, nebet.

Id: [0x000F629D]
It's the slabs.

Id: [0x000F629E]
I know. I will have you switched with someone at the pools. That should provide some relief for awhile.

Id: [0x000F629F]
Yes, I think that would be best. We should do the same for the others.

Id: [0x000F62A0]
Good idea.

Id: [0x000F62A6]
If a man were to rescue my taster, I would give him all the bread he could hold.

Id: [0x000F62AF]
Someone has been here...

Id: [0x000F62B2]
May the lungs of Ahmes the fruit-seller pass through the entrails of diseased rats.

Id: [0x000F62B4]
I should not be talking to you. I have baking to do.

Id: [0x000F62B8]
Charms of Anubis. Someone has put these here, but why?

Id: [0x000F62BA]
More charms. What were they trying to achieve?

Id: [0x000F62BE]
The torches bear a new flame! Strong and vibrant!

Id: [0x000F62BF]
I have just seen the one by the pool! Anubis has been appeased. Rejoice!

Id: [0x000F62EF]
Tonight Herakleion is going to feel like Babylon!

Id: [0x000F62F0]
Babylon sucks compared to this place! Less Persians here!

Id: [0x000F62F5]
Ah! Look who has returned! Bayek of Siwa! Perfect that you have met us in Herakleion, a city of wine, women, whatever a Medjay like you desires... and deserves.

Id: [0x000F62F6]
Bayek. You arrive at an opportune time.

Id: [0x000F62F7]
Cleopatra. I am still looking for the men who killed my son. The Order is neutralized. Was my hunt for me or for you?

Id: [0x000F62F8]
What does the badge mean to you? Have you forgotten?

Id: [0x000F6308]
With Septimius? The Roman lug? He leads them?

Id: [0x000F6309]
Yes, the dreamer who posits himself as truly Egyptian, and yet sends a man to murder me. Not very Egyptian if you ask me.

Id: [0x000F631D]
Do you know where the actors hide?

Id: [0x000F6338]
The censor has his work cut out for him.

Id: [0x000F6339]
Today's batch was especially putrid.

Id: [0x000F633C]
Welcome, welcome to Letopolis! Final dream of the late Taharqa.

Id: [0x000F634B]
I am going to work at the brothels. Babylon has no work. The royals are too weak. No one wants to be with this lady of the streets.

Id: [0x000F634C]
Oh the wild type. You want me to tame you?

Id: [0x000F634D]
No, thank you nebet.

Id: [0x000F634E]
Fine. I hope he's not friends with those Gabinanis.

Id: [0x000F6351]
You look like you need to forget about your wife? A little extra love?

Id: [0x000F6352]
I am loyal to my wife, thank you.

Id: [0x000F6353]
You can bring her along. This brothel does not judge. She shouldn't have left you alone. I hope she's doing something important. I would never leave you.

Id: [0x000F635B]
I will not rest until we find this fiend.

Id: [0x000F635E]
I still do not know what happened here.

Id: [0x000F6360]
These Egyptians are already looking to fight. I must find whoever did this.

Id: [0x000F6361]
Nek. The cat was attacked by the Roman soldier. Whoever did this was protecting them.

Id: [0x000F641C]
Neb! I must speak with you.

Id: [0x000F641F]
Now please, just leave me alone before someone sees you. Just act normal.

Id: [0x000F6434]
I look forward to meeting them.

Id: [0x000F6467]
I should investigate further.

Id: [0x000F6478]
The trail goes to the north. I must follow it.

Id: [0x000F64AA]
It lifts my heart to see you, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F64AB]
Aya, you are the one joy left in my life. I want you at my side again.

Id: [0x000F64AD]
I am bound to the Queen's service.

Id: [0x000F64AE]
And our bond?

Id: [0x000F64AF]
It means as much as ever! But we have seen the Order's evil now.

Id: [0x000F64B0]
We can fight it shoulder to shoulder.

Id: [0x000F64B1]
I've promised the Queen…

Id: [0x000F64B2]
What has she done for you that I have not?

Id: [0x000F64B3]
She lifts my gaze to the horizon.

Id: [0x000F64B5]
I will never stop mourning what we lost. Never.

Id: [0x000F64B6]
But I must make a world that is larger than our griefs, so that no mother ever again lives what I have lived.

Id: [0x000F64B9]
Where will your duty take you?

Id: [0x000F64BA]
North. To set the sea aflame.

Id: [0x000F64BB]
I walk on your water.

Id: [0x000F64BC]
I hope we will hunt together again. Until then, let us take this night as ours.

Id: [0x000F64D1]
No! <LF>

Id: [0x000F64E7]
Burning corpses! This is blasphemy! Who did this?

Id: [0x000F651B]
[Gamoto](Shit!) Phoxidas, why are we delivering all this treasure? We could retire to Lesbos with this amount of gold!

Id: [0x000F6530]
If that chest doesn't make it to Pompey, this ship won't either. We crawl through Hades to deliver it if we have to.

Id: [0x000F6531]
Fair enough! Back to work, you slack vlakos! Damastes, my trusted shield boy, get to it!

Id: [0x000F6552]
I have traveled through the tomb, dark and lonely ground. I am here now. I have come.

Id: [0x000F6569]
After I kill the Lizard--

Id: [0x000F656A]
After you kill the Lizard, I will leave Memphis.

Id: [0x000F656B]
Then I will follow. Let us hunt together, as we did before.

Id: [0x000F656C]
I love you more than I can say, Bayek. I will think on this.

Id: [0x000F65A1]
Who stole the lion skin?

Id: [0x000F65A8]
I turned away from the lion skin for a moment and a bandit nabbed it, and ran away. I lost him in the crowd.

Id: [0x000F65C7]
Aya--

Id: [0x000F65D2]
Phanos awaits you.

Id: [0x000F65D3]
Now there is nothing that will stop us from exposing this regime!

Id: [0x000F65D8]
You did it, Bayek. Thank you. I never doubted you. Aya is a lucky woman.

Id: [0x000F65D9]
Now we can perform this play like true poets. The guards may kill us, but it is an artist's duty to see his vision fulfilled!

Id: [0x000F65DB]
Don't worry, we'll change the names of the main villain, Ptolemy, and the title. We won't die, and the play will go on.

Id: [0x000F65DF]
We shall carve out your eyes and amputate your hands so that your foul poetry ceases!

Id: [0x000F65E1]
Kill this traitor. He is nothing more than a cheap comic.

Id: [0x000F6618]
Poor soul even worked for him. Tragic. He is an honest man.

Id: [0x000F661E]
Looks like you need more than a magician.

Id: [0x000F6673]
Time for a short break, lil buddy

Id: [0x000F6674]
If you say so. I feel fine though. 

Id: [0x000F6675]
Well your vitals are stable, but a little high, so I think you should take a minute to settle.  In fact I'd like to see if you can see what's at the bottom of that sink hole

Id: [0x000F6676]
Sure. I'll see what I can see.

Id: [0x000F6677]
I see something, but it's too dark. I'm gonna see if there's a way down. 

Id: [0x000F6678]
Dammit!!

Id: [0x000F6679]
Laila!!?? ...Laila!? You alright? 

Id: [0x000F667A]
I'm fine... I think...

Id: [0x000F667B]
Ho Damn.

Id: [0x000F667C]
What is it? What do you see? 

Id: [0x000F667D]
I... I think this is... Aya. The ground must have fallen out right under her sarcophagus.

Id: [0x000F667E]
Can you get out of there? 

Id: [0x000F667F]
Not the way I came in. I see a path behind Aya. 

Id: [0x000F6680]
Just be careful.

Id: [0x000F6681]
How are you making out? 

Id: [0x000F6682]
Pretty great, actually. I need to scale the cavern to get out. I feel so... sure footed. 

Id: [0x000F6683]
We've read about this. The more time you pass in the Animus with a single subject, the more in synch you become with them. 

Id: [0x000F6684]
I remember. I just didnt think it would manifest itself so... physically. 

Id: [0x000F6685]
Just take it slow alright. 

Id: [0x000F6686]
Yea, yea.

Id: [0x000F6687]
And we're back! 

Id: [0x000F6688]
Awesome! Ready when you are. 

Id: [0x000F669A]
This must be dealt with quickly. Is there no one up to my task?

Id: [0x000F6758]
Act natural. We are meant to preside these grounds. Remember that.

Id: [0x000F675B]
These are allies of the Ptolemies, here to make an offering to the great Caesar.

Id: [0x000F675C]
Carry on then. An offering?

Id: [0x000F675D]
This carpet I carry. It is a symbol of unity with our Roman brothers.

Id: [0x000F675E]
Step aside legionaries, official business for the Pharaoh.

Id: [0x000F675F]
Who are you? You look like a hippodrome racer.

Id: [0x000F6760]
The Siwan Warrior.

Id: [0x000F6761]
Move along, showering Caesar with gifts! He has that kind of effect!

Id: [0x000F6762]
These myrmidons make me proud to serve the Queen.

Id: [0x000F6763]
Silence! What business do you have with Caesar?

Id: [0x000F6767]
In Giza, a friend dies every day.

Id: [0x000F676A]
Rudjek was only the beginning.

Id: [0x000F676B]
Yes, your hunt. The Heron.

Id: [0x000F6787]
Finally! Change of plans, Heracles.

Id: [0x000F6788]
I am so happy you have come to assist me, sir.

Id: [0x000F6789]
We will get you home fast. Do not worry.

Id: [0x000F678A]
Oh, of course. Thank you, my bull. You look just like Heracles. Perhaps I'll call you my Heracles.

Id: [0x000F678B]
Who? No matter, child, it's time to return you home.

Id: [0x000F678C]
I will not go. Have you met the priests here? Dull.

Id: [0x000F678D]
Or what?

Id: [0x000F678E]
I will scream. Which will call the soldiers. Then, well, even if you survive, Father will be quite angry.

Id: [0x000F678F]
Anubis take this city.

Id: [0x000F6790]
What was that?

Id: [0x000F6791]
Nothing.

Id: [0x000F6792]
Good! First we must get my horse. She's been treated absolutely terribly without me around.

Id: [0x000F6793]
Fear and rage are fair replies to life's fragility.

Id: [0x000F6797]
There now, was that so difficult?

Id: [0x000F67AB]
Seems like someone managed to get out of their cage when the guards weren't looking.

Id: [0x000F67B2]
Bayek! Finally, someone who appreciates my genius. My play has been confiscated!

Id: [0x000F67B6]
And lizards...

Id: [0x000F67BA]
Time to go, young poet.

Id: [0x000F67D3]
That is it. I am taking you home, Princess Kara.

Id: [0x000F67D6]
I'm sure my father would not be pleased with you discussing this in front of him, horseman.

Id: [0x000F67D7]
Oh, Pegasus. I know you missed me. Yes, you did, you beautiful creature. If only you had wings! Time to go, bodyguard.

Id: [0x000F67DF]
This is not your home.

Id: [0x000F67E0]
It is on the way to my home. I thought we might want to take some air in this market, guard.

Id: [0x000F67E1]
Why is that?

Id: [0x000F67E3]
The Phylakitai here is in love with me. If he sees you with me, well, he has quite a temper.

Id: [0x000F67EF]
It is time to go to your home.

Id: [0x000F67F4]
It is very different. Perhaps if you spend more time in Alexandria you'll see that. You could even become a Phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F67FC]
Ugh! It's so heavy. Would you help me?

Id: [0x000F6805]
Bayek! Pegasus! They stole my horse!

Id: [0x000F6809]
Please! I need help!

Id: [0x000F680A]
Ugh. Get away from me! I have things to do!

Id: [0x000F680E]
…Papa, since Pegasus was limping, Bayek went to deal with her shoe. He was only gone a moment!

Id: [0x000F680F]
Can he always be my bodyguard? Please, Father?

Id: [0x000F6810]
Ah. I heard of some commotion, but according to my little princess, you're the hero of the day.

Id: [0x000F6812]
This entire city was lost to the cruel desert in the time of our ancestors. But the great Taharqa rediscovered its secrets!

Id: [0x000F6813]
He is uncovering it to shine again under the sun, and dedicating the city to Horus. With bright wings, we will reach the stars!

Id: [0x000F6816]
My cart is gone! Can anyone help?

Id: [0x000F6817]
Pathetic fool. Stop bothering me!<LF>

Id: [0x000F6819]
Khufu and Chiera are gone!

Id: [0x000F681A]
Eh? Who are they?

Id: [0x000F681B]
My beloved oxen! Can you help me get my cart?

Id: [0x000F681C]
Crying over oxen? Hah! Piss off!

Id: [0x000F681E]
Welcome, friend! A new life awaits you here, in Letopolis, the city of Horus! Come, find your path, and walk into a new age with us!

Id: [0x000F683E]
Oh, all you big, broody types are the same. Never let me have any fun.

Id: [0x000F6840]
I am sure he was very grateful.

Id: [0x000F6841]
Look there, bodyguard. That is where I had my first...discussion with a soldier.

Id: [0x000F6843]
You know you are absolutely destroying my chances at getting the perfect linens.

Id: [0x000F6844]
There are different kinds of linen?

Id: [0x000F6846]
You are much...more serious than my usual bodyguards.

Id: [0x000F6848]
Oh, and you might want to keep out of sight.

Id: [0x000F684C]
You have an interesting stare.

Id: [0x000F684D]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000F6854]
We are close. Finally.

Id: [0x000F6859]
You could move faster, bodyguard.

Id: [0x000F685A]
I have a name.

Id: [0x000F689B]
What say you, desert rat?

Id: [0x000F689D]
You will be well compensated for your work. Here are some drachmas to start.

Id: [0x000F689E]
This city is much more expensive than I'm used to.

Id: [0x000F689F]
I am here only a short while.

Id: [0x000F68D0]
Bayek of Siwa! Come closer.

Id: [0x000F68DA]
I bludgeoned Medunamun with this.

Id: [0x000F690E]
Pothinus and Septimius, gone. We missed them.

Id: [0x000F690F]
You will have your vengeance soon. This is Cleopatra's time, to officially become Queen.

Id: [0x000F6910]
If she is crowned Queen. We will be able to act from within. Crush the network.

Id: [0x000F6911]
Tomorrow our Queen will have turned flattery into progress. We'll reconvene tomorrow at the Gardens.

Id: [0x000F691C]
For once perhaps a Queen's entrance is unnecessary.

Id: [0x000F692C]
I should just leave you here.

Id: [0x000F692D]
You're duty bound to deliver me, are you not?

Id: [0x000F692E]
Who would know if I left?

Id: [0x000F6932]
Those guards are now dead because of you.

Id: [0x000F6933]
I told you to hide. You refused to listen.

Id: [0x000F6934]
Or, perhaps, you should learn to remedy your own choices.

Id: [0x000F6936]
She is hiding something.

Id: [0x000F6986]
I like this one.

Id: [0x000F6998]
Damn you, Rahotep. I should have tied you to a tree.

Id: [0x000F69E5]
What god can save us from Demons? We are lost! There's nowhere to hide. They see us. They know where we are... (sobbing)

Id: [0x000F6A26]
Rahotep, I'm sorry. The demons took him to their crocodile pit. How can anyone fight them?

Id: [0x000F6A29]
Demons do not bleed as these do. Listen to me. Each of you owes your life to my father.

Id: [0x000F6A2A]
Now my father needs you. If he lives, we save him. If not, we avenge him. Either way we fight!

Id: [0x000F6A2B]
Truly you are your father's son. You are right, Rahotep. Demons or not we will follow you!

Id: [0x000F6A2E]
Is everyone ok? Where is my father?

Id: [0x000F6A45]
We have been ready since the day the demon bandits attacked.

Id: [0x000F6A46]
Rahotep, you are a man today. You have earned your horse. I can no longer lead. You must lead us now.

Id: [0x000F6A48]
Your son is brave. I am glad to have helped him... though I doubt he will need help in the future. He will lead you well. Now I must go to hunt my own demons.

Id: [0x000F6A49]
He saved us all! He slew five of the demons alone! I saw it!

Id: [0x000F6A4A]
Father, Bayek of Siwa is also here. He fought with us.

Id: [0x000F6A73]
I'm sorry. I must seem childish to you.

Id: [0x000F6A74]
Believe me, no. I understand your grief.

Id: [0x000F6A75]
That's why you knew what to say, isn't it. Did you lose someone too?

Id: [0x000F6A76]
Many have lost loved ones to the Ptolemies.

Id: [0x000F6A77]
Does it get better?

Id: [0x000F6A78]
It gets better. But you will never be the same.

Id: [0x000F6A79]
Yes. I already know that…

Id: [0x000F6A7A]
What is your name?

Id: [0x000F6A7B]
I am Tuaa. I am not from here. I come from Krokodilopolis.

Id: [0x000F6A7C]
You're from Siwa? I can tell. You're so nice. Your people are kind.

Id: [0x000F6A7D]
You could return to your family. They will miss you. You could be happy again.

Id: [0x000F6A7E]
I can't go back to sewing carpets. Besides, my father will never look me in the face again.

Id: [0x000F6A7F]
Leopards! Bayek!

Id: [0x000F6A80]
Stay back!

Id: [0x000F6A81]
Dua Sobek! I thought we were dead!

Id: [0x000F6A82]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x000F6A83]
No, but that was terrifying! Death isn't so desirable when you really see it. I guess I do want to live.

Id: [0x000F6A84]
Ha! Now she wants to live! Ha, ha. Eh, that is good. But we should move before hyenas come for the carcasses.

Id: [0x000F6A85]
Could you take me to the docks?

Id: [0x000F6A8B]
You've decided where to go, then?

Id: [0x000F6A8C]
No, I think I know what to do. I'll head South, maybe even back to Krokodilopolis. I've always wanted to work at the theatre. This place has too many memories for me.

Id: [0x000F6A8D]
Don't forget your family. Your father will miss you, whatever you think.

Id: [0x000F6A93]
Soris might be bothering the sacred animals outside. He often plays at being a gladiator.

Id: [0x000F6A95]
I have told the children over and over that they are not permitted to play in the temple, but they never listen.

Id: [0x000F6A97]
Hasina loves to look at the sky. I think I saw her on her way to the upper floor.

Id: [0x000F6A9B]
Thank the gods that this festival will soon be over.

Id: [0x000F6A9D]
That was the fourth tourist this week to shout at me.

Id: [0x000F6A9F]
I hope you will find some answers in the market. The merchants have short tempers, and may refuse to speak.

Id: [0x000F6AA6]
Pamu does like a drink now and again.

Id: [0x000F6AA8]
We must have a warrior to fight for Sekhmet, or else the festival will be a disaster. Shame will come to all of Yamu.

Id: [0x000F6AAA]
I hope the High Priest will not be too angry with me.

Id: [0x000F6AAD]
Even comedy knows something of truth and justice. Let the poets rule.

Id: [0x000F6AAF]
Exactly. By the gods, we will decree you to be sent to the Devourer.

Id: [0x000F6AB0]
Greatest city in the world? Pah. Athens is better! Aristophanes would be ashamed!

Id: [0x000F6AB4]
What are you coming back to me for? Hurry up!

Id: [0x000F6AB6]
The longer you wait, the more my husband suffers.

Id: [0x000F6AB8]
My poor Klaudios!

Id: [0x000F6ABA]
My dear husband!

Id: [0x000F6ABC]
The Alexandrian poets! My actors! Now we are only missing the great work to fill their mouths with poetry!

Id: [0x000F6B43]
I must carry out my father's dream.

Id: [0x000F6B45]
I do not ask your assistance.

Id: [0x000F6B47]
I can do this alone.

Id: [0x000F6B48]
I am going to find those thieves! They ought to pray to all their gods that my notes are undamaged!

Id: [0x000F6B5B]
If you are thinking of chasing these thieves down, just, be careful! If something happened to you, I could not forgive myself.

Id: [0x000F6B61]
(laughs) Ingenious.

Id: [0x000F6B62]
It's an ancient blade that killed the tyrant Xerxes. A weapon of justice.

Id: [0x000F6B68]
These tracks are fresh and lead southward. If I am lucky, they have not yet disappeared beneath the sand.

Id: [0x000F6B6B]
The thieves fled towards those ruins.

Id: [0x000F6B71]
Leave me be.

Id: [0x000F6B74]
I'm just finding things for Anta! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000F6B76]
I'm a Medjay -- looking for some thieves who came this way. Did you see anyone?

Id: [0x000F6B77]
Oh! No. No one!

Id: [0x000F6B78]
Are you here alone?

Id: [0x000F6B80]
I remember all their names, you know.

Id: [0x000F6B81]
Whose names?

Id: [0x000F6B82]
... Yes?

Id: [0x000F6B83]
If we go to find you your linens, would you be happy?

Id: [0x000F6B84]
Really? Of... course! Thank you, Bayek!

Id: [0x000F6B85]
It grows late. I must finish this job. We go, now.

Id: [0x000F6B89]
Can't even look an actor in the face.

Id: [0x000F6B8A]
Anyone have any food? Water? Anything?

Id: [0x000F6B8B]
Could do with a bit of food though.

Id: [0x000F6C2A]
I found the cakes and destroyed them.

Id: [0x000F6C2B]
Medjay… This terrible situation has brought about one good result.

Id: [0x000F6C3B]
Unhand her you fiend!

Id: [0x000F6C6C]
This is the camp where Anta is being held. The children gave everything to these bandits, so I should keep an eye out for Corteseos' notes.

Id: [0x000F6C71]
That's the bandit horseman who took Anta from the children.

Id: [0x000F6C80]
Tracks? You cannot be serious.

Id: [0x000F6C87]
Here, stand up!

Id: [0x000F6C89]
Damn, I thought you were lying on it.

Id: [0x000F6C9C]
(Humming and whistling)

Id: [0x000F6C9D]
(nervous whistling)

Id: [0x000F6CA8]
Silence, boy! You will not speak!

Id: [0x000F6CB2]
Eh, do not threaten me, Neb! I am a Medjay. If the boy speaks the truth, I will find your gold Sobeks. If he lies, he is yours to deal with.

Id: [0x000F6CBC]
Silence! And you -- step back, [sekhety](peasant)!

Id: [0x000F6CC6]
This has nothing to do with you, [sekhety](peasant)! Crawl back into your desert hole.

Id: [0x000F6CD6]
People have gone missing? Have you told the Phylakitai [protector]?

Id: [0x000F6CDE]
Do you know anything about the missing people?

Id: [0x000F6CE2]
Hi. What's your name?

Id: [0x000F6CE4]
The farmers. They're keeping them alive for some reason. 

Id: [0x000F6CE5]
Would ya look at the size of this thing!? How would they even get it on!?

Id: [0x000F6CE6]
Gross!! They're completely squashed!

Id: [0x000F6CE7]
'War Elephant Training Manual''... hmmm....

Id: [0x000F6CEB]
Who is this new hot warrior?

Id: [0x000F6CEC]
I should be looking for these twins.

Id: [0x000F6CED]
Everybody wants the Twins, they are Venator's favourite. (sighs) But he was cruel with them.

Id: [0x000F6CEE]
Ah, a true warrior. I have a discount for, wait, you are not with the Gabinianis are you?

Id: [0x000F6CF0]
No way, futuo! I can't wait to burn Cleopatra.

Id: [0x000F6CF4]
We have not slept through the night since.

Id: [0x000F6CFD]
Come, let us search the farm, look for survivors. I am Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F6D01]
Nenet! Are you alright? What happened here?

Id: [0x000F6D02]
What is happening here?

Id: [0x000F6D04]
*Woman Screaming* HELP ME! 

Id: [0x000F6D05]
Now you die!

Id: [0x000F6D06]
I won't rest until his body is food for the worms. Would you lend your sword?

Id: [0x000F6D07]
How did you es-

Id: [0x000F6D08]
No one sees poor Nenet, an old woman's husk with clouded eyes. But I saw them. Didn't cry out. Bit my tongue 'til I choked on the blood.

Id: [0x000F6D0D]
Gladly. Your plight is true.

Id: [0x000F6D25]
How do I find him?

Id: [0x000F6D26]
He dresses elegantly, and, due to our failed attack, now has guards in tow. He'll be hard to miss.

Id: [0x000F6D32]
You sought to kill my wife.

Id: [0x000F6D34]
May the Hidden One walk beside you. The lord of Duat awaits.

Id: [0x000F6D36]
(sobbing)

Id: [0x000F6D37]
(wailing)

Id: [0x000F6D39]
[whistling]

Id: [0x000F6D3A]
Are you Theodoros' men?

Id: [0x000F6D57]
My sweet Taimhotep… my lotus… May she not be too angry with me!

Id: [0x000F6DC8]
I have come to seek the Lizard.

Id: [0x000F6DC9]
Pash!

Id: [0x000F6DCB]
What are you doing here? Leave me alone!

Id: [0x000F6DCC]
You're coming with me.

Id: [0x000F6DD1]
Glory to Theodoros!

Id: [0x000F6DEA]
My sisters, this is surely an accident?

Id: [0x000F6DEB]
One, maybe. But not a bushel.

Id: [0x000F6DEC]
Something is wrong. These are no curses.

Id: [0x000F6DF2]
One more villain in the dirt. You've had your vengeance, Theodoros. Was it worth it?

Id: [0x000F6DF3]
Hah, I was wondering the same. I have not visited my father's tomb since he was killed by Derratos.

Id: [0x000F6DFA]
Hetepi. What could have driven him to such madness?

Id: [0x000F6E02]
I'm glad I survived long enough to see this day.

Id: [0x000F6E03]
And Theodoros experienced it first hand. My only regret is that we didn't snuff out this bastard sooner.

Id: [0x000F6E25]
Because Anubis is displeased. Ever since you left, the torches by his shrines have lost their flame.

Id: [0x000F6E26]
Bayek… I hope this hunt of yours ends soon, before you cannot return from what you have become.

Id: [0x000F6E34]
Sobek eats with his mouth... He with the pointed teeth... Sobek eats while he mates... He rends whom he will...

Id: [0x000F6E44]
The body looks to be a Greek. It has been here a while. That explains the smell. He was struck down from behind.

Id: [0x000F6E50]
Is she alright?

Id: [0x000F6E51]
As well as anyone can be with Flavius desecrating your land. I've followed that fucker's murderous trail all the way from Siwa.

Id: [0x000F6E55]
I pray the dice fall in your favour, Bayek. I must deal with his lapdog the magistrate Leander. Seek me out again if you would be a friend to Cyrene.

Id: [0x000F6E5D]
Nefertari sent reinforcements I see?

Id: [0x000F6E5E]
The path to the mine was clear, but that doesn't mean it will be on the way back. Be ready for anything.

Id: [0x000F6E64]
The fire will alert the regime!

Id: [0x000F6ED1]
Be well, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F6ED5]
Meketre, I think we are done. You fought like a lion, yourself.

Id: [0x000F6ED6]
I have learned much from you! You've made me a better protector. Egypt needs more people like you.

Id: [0x000F6ED8]
Hush, nebet. We do not know he has crossed over yet.

Id: [0x000F6ED9]
Without him, no one will help me tend the field. Or keep me safe. Or sing to me under the stars.

Id: [0x000F6EDA]
I will see what I can find.

Id: [0x000F6EF4]
What a shame. Such a pretty girl.

Id: [0x000F6FBC]
Come!

Id: [0x000F6FBD]
She tricked us both.

Id: [0x000F6FBE]
Your men?

Id: [0x000F6FBF]
The pile of dead gets bigger. We will treat the survivors. No time to fetch another healer.

Id: [0x000F7009]
I managed to escape i am hidden in the haystack please drive me out of here

Id: [0x000F7011]
Where is it!?

Id: [0x000F7012]
Nek! The ring!

Id: [0x000F701D]
This is our pyramid!

Id: [0x000F7025]
GAAASP!!!! Holy !

Id: [0x000F7026]
Laila? You there? Your vitals just spiked.

Id: [0x000F7027]
Yeh... yeh I'm fine. Just... That was intense.

Id: [0x000F7028]
Indeed. I cant beleive how well this thing works.

Id: [0x000F7029]
I'm going back in.

Id: [0x000F702A]
Slow down there, lil' buddy. Take a moment to settle yourself down. Your heart rate is still racing. We're not in any rush.

Id: [0x000F702B]
Fine. Maybe I'll get some supplies from the jeep.

Id: [0x000F702C]
You do remember where you parked it right?

Id: [0x000F702D]
...funny guy.

Id: [0x000F702E]
You HAVE forgetten where you parked it, havent you?

Id: [0x000F702F]
Dick. 

Id: [0x000F7030]
Pretty sure it's still outside where I left it. Just looking around a little. Wish I brought some climbing gear.

Id: [0x000F7036]
Whoa, there, girl. Time to get home. Your troublesome mistress will have missed you.

Id: [0x000F703A]
Still exploring? 

Id: [0x000F703B]
Beep Beep!! Follow sound of the horn if you're lost.

Id: [0x000F703C]
Ready to go when you are.

Id: [0x000F703F]
Good! It is settled. Follow me.

Id: [0x000F7041]
The thing I ask you to do is of the utmost importance.

Id: [0x000F7042]
Of course it is.

Id: [0x000F7043]
Being a merchant is no simple matter, sir. I assure you, moving tiger skins or even statues is not easy work.

Id: [0x000F7045]
Ah, these workers! Never where you tell them to be. As I was saying, you must be quick.

Id: [0x000F7048]
Seems you care a lot for your...cargo.

Id: [0x000F7049]
Stay here. Do not leave!

Id: [0x000F704C]
I swear on her mother's grave, she was sent from the Gods to make Alexandria better.

Id: [0x000F704F]
I have your bodyguard, Kara. Do not let this be a repeat of the last time, daughter.

Id: [0x000F7051]
Medjay, I will pour drachmas down your throat as long as she is safe. And Kara, remember the reception tonight. You will be ready.

Id: [0x000F7052]
Of course father! I would not miss it!

Id: [0x000F7053]
No! I must go to the central market. I heard of new Persian linens. I need them.

Id: [0x000F705E]
Your conscience would, of course.

Id: [0x000F7065]
I did not say I was seeking out the Phylakitai's affections.

Id: [0x000F7066]
Of course. Will you hurry?

Id: [0x000F7067]
I need to find the perfect linen for the event tonight.

Id: [0x000F7068]
Again! I thought you weren't going!

Id: [0x000F7069]
Eugh, not to father's event. No, tonight I will see the real Alexandria. I hear the theatre has ambrosia.

Id: [0x000F706D]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000F706E]
Ah, you do know my name.

Id: [0x000F706F]
But I don't have my linens.

Id: [0x000F7070]
The bodyguards. I send gifts to their families when I can.

Id: [0x000F7072]
Kara.

Id: [0x000F7074]
Kara.

Id: [0x000F7076]
It is done.

Id: [0x000F7078]
Aya would like your spirit.

Id: [0x000F7079]
Others thought the way you do. Then they murdered my son. Everything is personal, you filthy neket iadet.

Id: [0x000F707D]
Or the soldiers shouldn't follow orders from a drunk.

Id: [0x000F707E]
Oh. And do not stray from your task. At all. I will know if you have. This is all I have left since the flood.

Id: [0x000F7082]
Ha ha! Just like the Battle of Salamis, Captain! I have you trapped!

Id: [0x000F7083]
Here comes Themistocles. And that is the game!

Id: [0x000F7089]
Mind your tongue, old man! Or you'll discover I'm better at swordplay than sailing.

Id: [0x000F7090]
Is it? Pompey will be at the appointed place, off Thera's coast. Sail on!

Id: [0x000F7091]
I cannot kill this sacred creature. I should avoid it.

Id: [0x000F7093]
I thought the sacred crocodiles of Krokodilopolis were tame.

Id: [0x000F7095]
I don't know what you've got against dogs.

Id: [0x000F7096]
Sehetep chose death.

Id: [0x000F7097]
The main Temple of Sobek. Sehetep is inside. He will be well guarded.

Id: [0x000F7099]
You are on the wrong side of Sobek, traveler! And in the wrong place!

Id: [0x000F70A1]
I'm not dying over this! Hold him off!

Id: [0x000F70A2]
Fighting out here feeds a man. But there is no glory in it. Nothing beats the screams of thirty thousand bloodthirsty fans!

Id: [0x000F70A7]
Nek! Bion we cannot live scared! You must fight back!

Id: [0x000F70A8]
You truly are a gift from the gods Zahra. I tell all my Greek friends of Zahra, the warrior farmer.

Id: [0x000F70A9]
We need to find the bandits' nest.

Id: [0x000F70AE]
Just as the praying man said. This farm was torched as if by Ra himself.

Id: [0x000F70AF]
Who is this shrine dedicated to?

Id: [0x000F70B7]
You fight well, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F70B8]
As do you. Your study was not wasted.

Id: [0x000F70B9]
Zahra, do not argue with me about this. I have to do this next task alone.

Id: [0x000F70CC]
Oil, and lots of it. This is how they are starting the fires.

Id: [0x000F70EF]
You know the Son of Ra is crazy right?

Id: [0x000F70F0]
Why? Because he's not like everyone else? He opened our eyes! He never lied to us. He doesn't even take anything from the farms.

Id: [0x000F70F1]
But they have caught him now.

Id: [0x000F70F2]
The Son of Ra will never give up and neither should we. Don't you know what happened to him? His family?

Id: [0x000F70F3]
They burned his farm for no reason. He watched his family die!

Id: [0x000F70F4]
Which is why he hates farmers more than he hates soldiers. They all just stood back and watched. Well they'll burn too, one by one.

Id: [0x000F70F5]
But they are going to execute him now. What do we do?

Id: [0x000F70FD]
You have been looking for us, we know. We thought we would save you time and come to you.

Id: [0x000F70FE]
We are here to help. When we bring you to the fire, you will understand. You will be purified.

Id: [0x000F70FF]
The flames will release your pain. It will all burn away. Son of Ra will set you free.

Id: [0x000F7128]
Curse the King! Curse this miserable city! Curse Eudoros! May they all rot!

Id: [0x000F712A]
Where's that bottle of wine?

Id: [0x000F712C]
No one can get him back for me! He'll die in prison because of that viper, Eudoros!

Id: [0x000F712E]
What will I do without him? Without my Aristo? My comforter, my joy, my love.

Id: [0x000F712F]
If you free him, I know of a boat that will take him on the southern docks. I will wait for you.

Id: [0x000F7132]
Watch where you're going! Can you not see I'm escaping?

Id: [0x000F7134]
Please, we must get out of this city.

Id: [0x000F7136]
Aristo! Over here! The boat is ready. We set sail as soon as you're aboard.

Id: [0x000F7137]
My wife! Thank the beneficent gods!

Id: [0x000F7139]
My love! I'm so grateful that you are free!

Id: [0x000F7143]
So the rumors?

Id: [0x000F7144]
True. As are his preparations for war.

Id: [0x000F7173]
I will stand by my duty!

Id: [0x000F717E]
It is agony to leave you, but... I must go on alone.

Id: [0x000F717F]
Attacking starboard!

Id: [0x000F7183]
Agh! Flee you fools! Don't mind the flaming arrows.

Id: [0x000F71A4]
Well we could have let you die…

Id: [0x000F71AE]
Bandits have the girl's poor mother surrounded.

Id: [0x000F71C2]
Hey! A bad omen! Sobek is sick!

Id: [0x000F71C3]
Petsuchos is angry! The image of Sobek shows the god's will! What will we do?

Id: [0x000F71C4]
Did you see his eyes? Something is wrong. We're cursed!

Id: [0x000F71C5]
That's a bad omen for certain! Something awful is going to happen! O Sobek! Forgive us!

Id: [0x000F71C7]
I… do not know what happened! Petsuchos has never attacked anyone before. His eyes turned red! Did you see?! Is Sobek displeased with us?

Id: [0x000F71CA]
Nek! Even the gods turn their backs on the people. Where is Petsuchos now?

Id: [0x000F71CB]
Our priest, Sehetep, took the god back to the pool inside the temple. I have never seen him like this!

Id: [0x000F71DE]
This was the man who poisoned the crocodiles. He was taking orders from "Melina the Hibiscus".

Id: [0x000F71E5]
I wonder how you all entered my palace?

Id: [0x000F71ED]
He is the Siwan!

Id: [0x000F71EE]
I come on his behalf. He'll be joining us shortly with instructions.

Id: [0x000F71EF]
You're with me. But don't forget, he's mine!

Id: [0x000F71F2]
What is your stake in this? This is more about him than it is about your war.

Id: [0x000F71F3]
Theodoros!

Id: [0x000F71F7]
How could a priest have wronged Apis so?

Id: [0x000F71F9]
May Ptah strike down our enemies, and be gentle with our friends.

Id: [0x000F71FB]
The god's breath put speed into your step.

Id: [0x000F71FD]
My father grew figs in the Faiyum. The best. Derratos taxed him. An Egyptian has no choice but to pay.

Id: [0x000F7200]
Our news won't grow fresher with time.

Id: [0x000F7202]
You'd keep the High Priest waiting?

Id: [0x000F720C]
I'm just here until I finish my stonemason's apprenticeship.

Id: [0x000F720E]
You are lucky you don't have family here. I used to like Memphis, but now, the smell of it makes me sick!

Id: [0x000F7210]
The gods have turned their faces away from us.

Id: [0x000F7212]
What's this?

Id: [0x000F7213]
Interesting... I need to find that tomb

Id: [0x000F721D]
Down there. One of our own has been captured by Phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F721F]
(angry) Phylakitai. (less angry) You're plotting an ambush?

Id: [0x000F7220]
Here's the research notes

Id: [0x000F7221]
This must be the blacksmith's tomb!

Id: [0x000F7226]
Yes! I figured it out

Id: [0x000F722D]
Good thing stonemasons are needed everywhere.

Id: [0x000F7234]
Pawura! Hail in peace!

Id: [0x000F7236]
How are you, [nebet](lady)?

Id: [0x000F7238]
You are Bayek of Siwa, aren't you? I've heard stories of the Medjay who crossed the desert.

Id: [0x000F723A]
I am Theodoros, one of many who rebel against the Phylakitai(police).

Id: [0x000F7249]
Quickly, to the Temple of Hathor.

Id: [0x000F724B]
Please find our brother!

Id: [0x000F7250]
Wait... Something changed here

Id: [0x000F725B]
And we nearly did. We found his camp, but they had greater numbers. We were forced to disband.

Id: [0x000F7292]
Trireme!

Id: [0x000F7294]
The gods have brought us together for this. Justice will be served today.

Id: [0x000F7298]
Your priest's clothing is just a mask for cowardice. By the god I hate masks.

Id: [0x000F7299]
All this grain. Shouldn't we leave some for the farmers?

Id: [0x000F729A]
Anyway, we know who it is -- that raving old maniac over there. We're watching him.

Id: [0x000F729B]
You die easily for a god.

Id: [0x000F729C]
I was asleep in a mound of dirt, now I rise from the buried earth.

Id: [0x000F72C3]
I will find a way to the market. This Embalmer has given his last show.

Id: [0x000F72C4]
Safe? No one is safe here! He kidnapped me at the market where I was selling fish.

Id: [0x000F72C9]
Turo! Remember he took a lashing to protect your daughter's honor? And you! Remember he crossed the desert to get your sick father a healer?

Id: [0x000F72CF]
Derratos figured him for a cheat, and took a bite of fruit to prove his point. He got a mouth full of worms.

Id: [0x000F72D2]
Medjay! Get away from her.

Id: [0x000F72D3]
Kara will have no other suitors but I! She is in love with me.

Id: [0x000F72D5]
Pegasus. Huh. I like it. It suits a horse.

Id: [0x000F72D8]
Have you found what you are looking for yet?

Id: [0x000F72E4]
Now, I'll show you what happens to those who desecrate my daughter's tomb!

Id: [0x000F72E6]
Hathor, protect me from this defiler.

Id: [0x000F72E7]
I have come only for you, Hyena. The gods need not be involved.

Id: [0x000F72E8]
You have infringed upon Eshe's place of rest, trespasser. The gods are already involved.

Id: [0x000F72E9]
You're in pursuit of the impossible, Khaliset. No measure of magic can bring our children back.

Id: [0x000F72EB]
You are attracting trouble.

Id: [0x000F72EC]
Be careful, Phanos. You are frail and brittle. You stick to writing, and I will help you find your play and actors.

Id: [0x000F72F0]
The Ptolemies have oppressed poets before! They banished us all to Nubian mines.

Id: [0x000F72F1]
In Siwa we had many great satires performed at the temple. I remember watching one in which Anubis gets engaged to a jackal.

Id: [0x000F72F2]
It is called "Phah-roar Enough", a rousing comedy about oppression and the ignorance of the Pharaoh. Oh, and lions.

Id: [0x000F72F3]
Sounds... interesting.

Id: [0x000F72F4]
Is this theatre not magnificent? And empty because of the regime. Please Bayek, fly like Senu and bring life back to this amphitheater.

Id: [0x000F72F7]
How, fascinating. I have yet to see the Egyptian satires.

Id: [0x000F72F8]
What is your play about?

Id: [0x000F72F9]
Aya always spoke highly of your plays.

Id: [0x000F72FA]
She enjoyed my pro-Cleopatra work, "My Pharaoh Lady."

Id: [0x000F72FD]
Who have these cultists caged?

Id: [0x000F7312]
Still spouting your nonsense! The Greeks will never accept you!

Id: [0x000F7313]
Yes, they will! I will be a philosopher soon!

Id: [0x000F7314]
I will write a play for you someday, Bayek… "The Last of the Medjay." No, no...

Id: [0x000F731C]
My child will come back through the powers of those who came before.

Id: [0x000F7320]
How much does it cost to hire a Medjay permanently?

Id: [0x000F7322]
From what? The wrath of Anubis?

Id: [0x000F732C]
At last, we have laid the Perfect God in his tomb.

Id: [0x000F732E]
The Apis Bull is in terrific health. Eating all the grass we can carry!

Id: [0x000F7330]
Soon I will hold my newest child in my arms. Taimhotep swears it will be a boy.

Id: [0x000F7332]
My poor daughters have been so neglected in all this. I must spend more time with them.

Id: [0x000F7334]
Hetepi once came to me with a proposition that we share the priesthood. Perhaps I should have been kinder to him...

Id: [0x000F7335]
Only the gods came before.

Id: [0x000F7336]
My heart bleeds without my Eshe by my side. Be thankful. Your blood will help bring her back.

Id: [0x000F734A]
You took the life of a Roman because he killed cats, and now you risk a riot in Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F734B]
Words are a powerful weapon.

Id: [0x000F734C]
The owner is obviously of substance. Not all Egyptians seem to be equal.

Id: [0x000F734E]
Who would do this?

Id: [0x000F735A]
Come if you want to. My duty is to save my father.

Id: [0x000F735B]
You are just a boy, but you have the conviction of a man. Your father would be proud.

Id: [0x000F7364]
Father! You live! ...What's wrong?

Id: [0x000F7376]
What's that, [Papo](Father)? [Papo](Father)?

Id: [0x000F737A]
Let us bring Nenet to my cart.

Id: [0x000F737B]
(Incoherent Mumbling)

Id: [0x000F737D]
I hope this heals the madness in this land.

Id: [0x000F7403]
Are you sure you do not want to sell that badge? No matter. Look for the stall under the bird nests. You will thank me.

Id: [0x000F7405]
You're a very cheeky child. Let's see what your mother has.

Id: [0x000F7406]
Take anything you want. As I told them, I do not have any money. But I have many unique treasures from Siwa.

Id: [0x000F7407]
Thanks for saving us. I guess you are real. Sorry I said you were fake.

Id: [0x000F7408]
I've got something... here. This is a genuine Imitation Siwan Kopesh. It is very rare, they don't make them anymore. Please take it with our gratitude.

Id: [0x000F7409]
Mother, he already knows...

Id: [0x000F7416]
No sign of the priest. Petsuchos looks agitated. I should try to stay unnoticed.

Id: [0x000F743A]
Mauled by crocodiles. What was he doing back here?

Id: [0x000F743E]
What? I love them! As long as you feed them they trust you. They're perfect for testing. Just don't feed them flowers. That's how I got my name you know.

Id: [0x000F743F]
I know. You poisoned your own dog by feeding it hibiscus flowers.

Id: [0x000F7440]
That priest is the greediest damned holy man I've ever known. I'd admire him if he didn't believe his own lies.

Id: [0x000F7444]
Hmm. My agent should be back by now. He better not have gotten himself caught. He'll mysteriously get sick if he has!

Id: [0x000F7447]
Came back from Balagrae with a crook up his arse. Demanded my taxes for the year! They burned my farm when I refused!

Id: [0x000F7448]
And you are sure it was Leander's men?

Id: [0x000F7449]
My wife said no good would come of defying him. I hate it when she's right.

Id: [0x000F744A]
Leander will pay. You have my word.

Id: [0x000F744B]
Your word, Diocles? Will that sow my scorched fields? Bring my goats back to life? I am done with you, and this land. Your word... pah!

Id: [0x000F744D]
And how has our most "venerated" magistrate extorted you, Egyptian?

Id: [0x000F7454]
Praxilla said you could help me. I am Bayek.

Id: [0x000F745F]
Kill the wounded last.

Id: [0x000F7460]
It is useless to fight! You are outmatched!

Id: [0x000F7461]
Lay down your weapons, and we will make it quick.

Id: [0x000F7462]
Those who oppose Ptolemy's reign die!

Id: [0x000F7463]
This one fights alongside these rebels. A fool's choice!

Id: [0x000F746A]
I want this man to be my partner.

Id: [0x000F746C]
Icarus was a thousand times better than you!

Id: [0x000F7472]
Ahh, eh! I am alone.

Id: [0x000F7476]
[screams]

Id: [0x000F74C6]
Shadya!

Id: [0x000F74C8]
I have to return his horse to him. Alive or dead, he will need it in the afterlife.

Id: [0x000F74C9]
You will always be honoured at our village. We will make a feast tonight. Will you join us?

Id: [0x000F74CB]
Oh that is how it is going to be? Then I am in too!

Id: [0x000F74EF]
I come up here a lot. Everything looks so beautiful. The people should be happy, but they are not.

Id: [0x000F74F1]
Don't worry. Your mother and father will look after them. Where is your house?

Id: [0x000F74F3]
On the hill there! See it?

Id: [0x000F74F5]
Yes… and soldiers.

Id: [0x000F74FF]
[La, la, la, la…](Singing.)

Id: [0x000F7500]
Bye Shadya! You and Iset enjoy your life!

Id: [0x000F7518]
Dark skin, light step, brooding. You must be the Siwan Felix raved about. It takes a lot to impress that one. You must be good.

Id: [0x000F751A]
But let's not do awkward introductions. I prefer to get straight to business, and your reputation precedes you.

Id: [0x000F751B]
If you've come to bleed for gain and glory, Cyrene welcomes you with open arms!

Id: [0x000F751C]
The glorious Medjay has returned. You caused quite the furor. You surprised me. Not bad for a sand scratcher. [spits]

Id: [0x000F751F]
I will find the fights, you win them, we both get rich. Or I get rich. You get what I give you.

Id: [0x000F7520]
If you want more challenge, head to Cyrene. I mentioned your name to the arena owner there. You are welcome. [spits]

Id: [0x000F753C]
Does not even make sense!

Id: [0x000F7609]
I need to learn more words

Id: [0x000F760A]
Hmm... I can't read this for now

Id: [0x000F760B]
I can't understand what's written yet

Id: [0x000F760C]
Hmm... I can't read this for now

Id: [0x000F760D]
I need to learn more words

Id: [0x000F760E]
I can't understand what's written yet

Id: [0x000F7658]
Oh-ho! Medjay!

Id: [0x000F7659]
Medjay! Come here!

Id: [0x000F765B]
I travel alone.

Id: [0x000F765E]
Of course. Have you heard about the palace? Crocodiles swarm its halls! Terrible! So many deaths.

Id: [0x000F765F]
I am hired to slaughter the beasts, but someone is pouring blood into the water to frenzy them.

Id: [0x000F7660]
And you want my help.

Id: [0x000F7661]
I am good at killing crocodiles.

Id: [0x000F7662]
Wait… "Cave" rhymes with "brave"! Missed that one.

Id: [0x000F7669]
The palace grounds are choked with Sobek's dead.

Id: [0x000F766A]
Ah, I knew I could count on you, Medjay the Mighty, Medjay the Majestic, Medjay the… mmm…

Id: [0x000F766E]
Medjay, I am struck dumb with fear by what I see before me!

Id: [0x000F7677]
I have two more names. The Order can't be--

Id: [0x000F7678]
And how many more names after that?

Id: [0x000F7692]
Did you see? In the pool… human body parts. Used to lure the crocodiles. Oh what horror!

Id: [0x000F7694]
But why?

Id: [0x000F7696]
Who knows why evildoers do evil?

Id: [0x000F7697]
I came just in time to see two people loading bodies onto boats and riding away.

Id: [0x000F7699]
One went toward the palace, and the other was headed for the mummification temple.

Id: [0x000F769D]
May you multiply happy years!

Id: [0x000F769E]
This is awful!

Id: [0x000F769F]
Give him a taste of his own cooking.

Id: [0x000F76A0]
Cleopatra offers gold to win my favor, once I've won Rome? Is that what friendship means to your queen?

Id: [0x000F76BC]
Let's visit this merchant of yours. I will follow you.

Id: [0x000F76C1]
Medjay! You are late… Sehetep's men came to kill me.

Id: [0x000F76C2]
So I see. Not bad for a priest who abhors bloodshed.

Id: [0x000F76C6]
Pompeius Magnus. Greetings and friendship from Queen Cleopatra.

Id: [0x000F76CE]
Whose face graces that coin? Do Roman women receive the same honor?

Id: [0x000F76D0]
A valuable friendship, indeed.

Id: [0x000F76FC]
Her aura is as strong as ever. Her temple will be redesigned in her name.

Id: [0x000F76FF]
This is not one man we are fighting. Nothing ends simply. Aya has understood that you have a new reality: I am your Pharaoh, you are Medjay to all of Egypt. Follow me, we have a gift.

Id: [0x000F7703]
Here is your gift. He is in the Order of Ancients like Septimius. We found him snooping around the villa. We think he knows who killed your son.

Id: [0x000F7704]
Futuo! Just kill me already you cowards.

Id: [0x000F772B]
I talked with Venator and he even paid me to light the braziers. Apparently Cleopatra's defenses are weak. This will be the easiest assassination in the world.

Id: [0x000F772F]
How do I look? Later on I plan on playing the lute for the Queen.

Id: [0x000F7730]
You look great. You are with the musicians who will play for Cleopatra? You are so lucky.

Id: [0x000F7732]
Alexus!

Id: [0x000F7733]
He was an imposter! A Roman man who wants to kill the Queen! I am doing you a favour!

Id: [0x000F773A]
My love, I can't believe you tire of my company already.

Id: [0x000F773C]
I know I stink of the road, but is it really that unpleasant?

Id: [0x000F775B]
Hold, Phoxidas. Look there at the water.

Id: [0x000F775F]
I'll hold you to that!

Id: [0x000F7764]
More fireships close! By the gods they're everywhere!

Id: [0x000F7765]
And our catapults with them! Put them to use! Brace!

Id: [0x000F77F3]
I'm looking for a large man by the name of Caius.  

Id: [0x000F77F4]
Havent seen him, gorgeous. I know he speant the night with the twins. Ask the owner where they are.  

Id: [0x000F7818]
As many as it takes.

Id: [0x000F7819]
I wish to bring my son to the after life where he belongs not-I like you Cleopatra, but the royal matters that seduced my wife do not sway me so.

Id: [0x000F781D]
No I am not. I am a Medjay.

Id: [0x000F781E]
I heard she was in town. Well, a Medjay working for his pharaoh, you must have gold to burn.

Id: [0x000F7820]
They had a rough night yesterday so don't "speak" too hard with them.

Id: [0x000F782D]
Well... when in Rome.

Id: [0x000F782E]
We're in Egypt idiot.

Id: [0x000F7834]
And I have already fought in the arena…

Id: [0x000F7839]
I have my hands full with the magistrate Leander. I know he's corrupt but his ties to Flavius put him above the law.

Id: [0x000F783A]
Then let us sever those ties.

Id: [0x000F783B]
Easier said than done. He's either threatened or bribed, anyone who would stand against him.

Id: [0x000F783D]
Simonides could help us if he wasn't such a drunkard. He was at Leander's villa last night and hasn't returned home.

Id: [0x000F7843]
Are you Simonides?

Id: [0x000F7845]
Ow my head! Why are you shouting?

Id: [0x000F7846]
Diocles sent me to find you.

Id: [0x000F7847]
Tell him I'm dead.

Id: [0x000F7848]
We need your help, with Leander.

Id: [0x000F7849]
That demon is the one responsible for my befuddled mind and evacuating bowels. I'm sure someone spiked my wine.

Id: [0x000F784A]
I am sorry, but I have to take you with me.

Id: [0x000F784B]
Bacchus and his nymphs be buggered. You sir are a Fury sent to punish me. If I expire on the way, it's on your head.

Id: [0x000F7850]
What is your name, torturer?

Id: [0x000F7851]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000F7852]
Egyptian?

Id: [0x000F7853]
Yes.

Id: [0x000F7855]
Diocles said you met with Leander last night?

Id: [0x000F7856]
A party. At his villa.

Id: [0x000F7857]
Sounds...

Id: [0x000F7858]
Fun? Urgh... a mission... on a mission...

Id: [0x000F7859]
Did you find anything?

Id: [0x000F785A]
Simonides? Are you alright?

Id: [0x000F785D]
You are the challenger? I'm going to enjoy this. Come on, they are waiting.

Id: [0x000F786E]
Why don't you take the next fight? I have had a few losses. I could use the rest.

Id: [0x000F7870]
Nek! What was that? The gods are rumbling! It came from just North of here. Must have something to do with this curse.

Id: [0x000F7883]
A real Medjay? Not a Phylakitai I hope! [laughs] I'm Zahra. This was my farm.

Id: [0x000F7885]
Hordes. The neket iadets trying to drive us out. They are lucky I wasn't here I would have spread their guts across my fields.

Id: [0x000F788B]
My name is Bayek, a Protector...

Id: [0x000F788C]
A protector? We could use one. Talk to my lady.

Id: [0x000F789E]
A man is coming. He is armed. What should we do?

Id: [0x000F789F]
I am armed too. We are not in any danger. Be calm.

Id: [0x000F78A7]
I do not suppose your Greek neighbor is harbouring these fire bandits?

Id: [0x000F78A8]
That would make things simpler. But no. Those are definitely uninvited guests.

Id: [0x000F78A9]
Keep a safe distance. I'm going to...

Id: [0x000F78AA]
Nek no! You are not! You keep a safe distance. I will be amidst the blood splatter!

Id: [0x000F78AC]
Okay, let's get there.

Id: [0x000F78AE]
Gods, by Anubis I love the desert! It awes me. It always has.

Id: [0x000F78AF]
I cried like a little girl the first time I came here. I didn't know why. My father told me I was being silly.

Id: [0x000F78B4]
A fighter like you must have a few farmers interested. Have you never wanted a family of your own? You do not have anyone in mind?

Id: [0x000F78B7]
I fight too much. Well, maybe a Medjay warrior could change that. (laughs)

Id: [0x000F78B8]
Bayek, we need to get moving. It's a long damned way.

Id: [0x000F78BA]
That looks like ruins up ahead.

Id: [0x000F78BC]
Dammit Bayek! We need to move.

Id: [0x000F78BD]
Ready to get these bandits?

Id: [0x000F78BE]
Nek! Where have you been? We need to go.

Id: [0x000F78C1]
What brings you to the Faiyum? We get few visitors this way. Medjay especially.

Id: [0x000F78C2]
I am… hunting murderers.

Id: [0x000F78C3]
You came to the right place. Full of dogs worth killing. The Faiyum is not the oasis it once was.

Id: [0x000F78C7]
How long have your farms been getting burned?

Id: [0x000F78C8]
Since the dawn of the New Ptolemy. Most of the farmers… they could not fight back and got pushed out.

Id: [0x000F78C9]
My family was amongst those who fought. The struggle became our way of life.

Id: [0x000F78CA]
I fought so much I forgot to fall in love. I am a romantic though. My father wanted me to marry and give him lots of grandchildren. Gods! Me with a bunch of screaming kids! Our land needed protection, so I learned to fight.

Id: [0x000F78CB]
Egypt needs fighters. It was a good decision.

Id: [0x000F78CC]
Turns out I am apt at shit kicking.

Id: [0x000F78CE]
His farm isn't far from here. See if you can keep up, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F78D9]
This badge means more to you than it does to me.

Id: [0x000F78DB]
If death requires dignity then allow me to decorate you, for you are a most decorated official.

Id: [0x000F78DE]
My Queen, rest and remember-

Id: [0x000F78DF]
I do not need rest. This civil war is no closer to ending. I need a fucking throne. My throne rots in the hands of my brother.

Id: [0x000F78FE]
Menehet…

Id: [0x000F7901]
[sobbing]

Id: [0x000F7902]
May the Field of Reeds be opened to you, Father.

Id: [0x000F7903]
I'll miss my father's kindness.

Id: [0x000F7904]
Hmm... I've seen something familiar to this diagram in Heliopolis before

Id: [0x000F7942]
I was not always a priest. I thought I had escaped all this…

Id: [0x000F7944]
We will rebuild what has been damaged. But what of the soldiers? They had a hand in all this.

Id: [0x000F7945]
They will always meddle. But stay strong. They know now not to mess with the temple. Sobek has warriors too.

Id: [0x000F794A]
Then it had to be. I lost a brother today. If I had acted sooner he might have been restored. Faith cannot be passive. This is my lesson.

Id: [0x000F7962]
I wonder how Diocles is faring?

Id: [0x000F7995]
An elaborate shrine to the serpent goddess, Wadjet.

Id: [0x000F799A]
This is what Ptolemy has done to Egypt. A land out of balance, full of hatred and strife.

Id: [0x000F79FF]
Save a place in the Duat for your brother Septimius.

Id: [0x000F7A00]
I am fine. Nothing hurts anymore.

Id: [0x000F7A02]
Instruct Phoxidas to prepare ship. We head to meet Pompey. My last resort.

Id: [0x000F7A07]
Septimius is the shit-eater. He is the man we must escort to the Devourer.

Id: [0x000F7A08]
And of Pothinus?

Id: [0x000F7A09]
He will be more fodder for the Devourer.

Id: [0x000F7A0A]
And then we return home.

Id: [0x000F7A0B]
We will only return home with Cleopatra in our company, to show the Siwans what has changed. What we have changed.

Id: [0x000F7A0C]
How are things on your trireme?

Id: [0x000F7A0D]
Great. Phoxidas has entrusted me with--

Id: [0x000F7A0E]
Why don't we take each other here.

Id: [0x000F7A0F]
In this reed boat?

Id: [0x000F7A10]
Take advantage of these rare moments between us, before your new job steals you away as savior of all of Egypt.

Id: [0x000F7A11]
You make jokes but it is not funny. It is greatness I am after. This country is at civil war. One simply cannot deny it. Everywhere is misery.

Id: [0x000F7A12]
I love you Aya. And we are Medjay. We do serve and protect but we work alone. I share your hatred for Ptolemy.

Id: [0x000F7A13]
I love you Bayek of Siwa. But what are you of now?

Id: [0x000F7A1C]
This is a cemetery for our ambitions.

Id: [0x000F7A32]
As I was saying - Pompey is here and we need to head north to speak with him. He'll make a powerful ally

Id: [0x000F7A33]
He would indeed. Let's go

Id: [0x000F7A34]
Come! We must make haste!

Id: [0x000F7A44]
Is that Methana? She hasn't burst for hundreds of years.

Id: [0x000F7A45]
Wouldn't surprise me if she burst now for us. Let loose a storm of sea dragons alongside her.

Id: [0x000F7A46]
You don't believe in that nonsense, do you, Phoxidas! Come on now!

Id: [0x000F7A47]
I am who I am. I do not change for Kings or Queens. I left my wife and kids behind for the same reason. No one sane accepts me.

Id: [0x000F7A48]
I accept you! We accept you. Alalalaa!

Id: [0x000F7A49]
These hundred nautai is enough acceptance for me. It's hard to say goodbye to those who don't accept us, but it is also the only way.

Id: [0x000F7A4A]
Civil war in Egypt and a mercenary trireme comes to my aid? In the midst of war with Caesar, I find it odd. Who in Hades are you?

Id: [0x000F7A4E]
I'm going to slice off your balls… and feed them to you.

Id: [0x000F7A5C]
All strange and terrible things are welcome.

Id: [0x000F7A5D]
Haha! I am worried that my quarters are not as comfortable as your palace.

Id: [0x000F7A5E]
Comforts? We despise them.

Id: [0x000F7A60]
My loyal shield boy, are you fit?

Id: [0x000F7A61]
I am in awe of this goddess. We must do her well. I can't believe she's on our ship.

Id: [0x000F7A62]
Don't be fooled by appearances. She needs us more than we need her. Aya she is the real goddess.

Id: [0x000F7A65]
Aya, already showing Bayek the best places to make love! Haha!

Id: [0x000F7A66]
A shred can be hard to come by.

Id: [0x000F7A67]
He speaks? The great Medjay.

Id: [0x000F7A86]
Everything for which we have worked for so long is now ours. We have defeated our enemies! Only I can lead Egypt into a new era of prosperity.

Id: [0x000F7A9E]
I will destroy Cleopatra for what she has done.

Id: [0x000F7A9F]
We must focus on the issue at hand.

Id: [0x000F7AA0]
What is left, Bayek? Tell me one thing left for us?

Id: [0x000F7AA1]
Siwa. The rest of our land. We cannot stop now, Aya. We have yet to find Khemu's killer.

Id: [0x000F7AA2]
Yes. We will not falter there.

Id: [0x000F7AA4]
There is something amiss with all of this. Something foul.

Id: [0x000F7AAE]
Flavius was behind it all… I am sorry… Flavius killed your son. They were here.

Id: [0x000F7AAF]
Siwa?

Id: [0x000F7AB1]
Stop your flailing. You will live, fool.

Id: [0x000F7AB3]
Bayek... Aya... Your people are in danger. Go... now. [Takes dying breath]

Id: [0x000F7AF5]
This is the place. The Hibiscus should be somewhere nearby. A woman amongst Ptolemy soldiers should not be hard to find.

Id: [0x000F7AFF]
There is nothing to be gained from unrest! Zeus will protect our founder.

Id: [0x000F7B1A]
He is inside! Get him when he comes out! He cannot escape!

Id: [0x000F7B1B]
Caretaker! The snakes were yours.

Id: [0x000F7B1C]
You serve Greeks?! Come on then you worthless Ionian slave. Do your master's bidding like a good Greek dog. I fight for Egypt! Who do you fight for?

Id: [0x000F7B21]
Ugh. I can smell the burnt flesh.

Id: [0x000F7B25]
That is the end of the Caretaker's cult. But Nanefer is right. Egypt is out of balance. And that is the Order of Ancients' doing.

Id: [0x000F7B32]
I might know where it is. Servants tracked riders coming south from the White Desert. There is nothing out that way except some ruins.

Id: [0x000F7B34]
And they mentioned the name Son of Ra. I think he is their leader.

Id: [0x000F7B58]
I just don't understand why we're dealing with those scale huggers!

Id: [0x000F7B59]
Have you seen the coffers of gold in the Captain's tent? That's a damned good reason right there.

Id: [0x000F7B5A]
What? Those are coming from the Sobek priests? Well then, never mind. I'll guard their temple anytime!

Id: [0x000F7B5B]
Ha-ha! You whore. Their requests for help keep increasing though. I don't think the Captain's happy about it.

Id: [0x000F7B5C]
Can you not leave a poor man alone to die?

Id: [0x000F7B5D]
Yes? Melpomene is with me and I don't want to waste her gift of words talking to you. No offense.

Id: [0x000F7B5E]
None taken.

Id: [0x000F7B60]
I am looking for Cyrene's greatest actor.

Id: [0x000F7B61]
HA! Good luck. This stage is only home to butchers and hacks. Did you see my last play? The most tragic story of the death of Socrates? The whole audience cried...with laughter when that blind-drunk fool fell into the orchestra.

Id: [0x000F7B62]
Is there one who is better than the rest?

Id: [0x000F7B63]
There is one who thinks he is. Metrobius. Perhaps if he spent less time drinking, whoring and bumping into the scenery and more time learning my epic poetry he would be.

Id: [0x000F7B64]
Have you seen him recently?

Id: [0x000F7B65]
Has a new gilded-nippled floozy. Red hair, meets her behind the seats.

Id: [0x000F7B66]
What is your name, friend?

Id: [0x000F7B67]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000F7B68]
Hmmmm. Bay-eeeek. Ba-yek...No, doesn't work.

Id: [0x000F7B6A]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000F7B6B]
The air stinks. But not of oarsmen. Something else...

Id: [0x000F7B6C]
Yes my captain! Alala!

Id: [0x000F7B6E]
I wonder if Cleopatra survived unmarked. Those clothes looked expensive.

Id: [0x000F7B6F]
All are safe. We're done.

Id: [0x000F7B72]
No. Curse you son of Ra.

Id: [0x000F7B73]
I won't ask where you found him, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F7B76]
On the street! Some fool moved the brothel.

Id: [0x000F7B7E]
The villa is east of here surrounded by vineyards. We will gather the other magistrates at the Temple of Apollo.

Id: [0x000F7B8C]
Can't you jump some more, Bayek?

Id: [0x000F7B8D]
Please? It's my birthday!

Id: [0x000F7B8E]
Stop crowding him. Stop crowding. He's not your slave. He is an important man with important things to do.

Id: [0x000F7B90]
I won't forget this day Bayek. We should honor it. I officially name you the flea of Cyrene.

Id: [0x000F7B92]
I will treasure it, Goodbye Esio, stay out of trouble.

Id: [0x000F7B93]
I can't promise, but I will try, for you, Great Flea. I hope you get to hunt with your son again soon!

Id: [0x000F7B96]
Liar! That was last month!

Id: [0x000F7B97]
Come on! My nana fights better than you and she's been in the ground ten years!

Id: [0x000F7B98]
You, you look like a fighter!

Id: [0x000F7B99]
You have a problem?

Id: [0x000F7B9C]
Yeah, alright do not get cocky. Rumor has reached me a farm east of Cyrene was attacked. Start there.

Id: [0x000F7BB7]
Did you see what they did to my home?

Id: [0x000F7BB8]
What happened here?

Id: [0x000F7BB9]
This guard all of my problems are because of him. they destroyed my home and killed my catlle.

Id: [0x000F7BBA]
He deserves to pay for what he as done. Please help me kill this guard and bring it back here before he destroys someone elses life

Id: [0x000F7BBB]
i'll make him pay for what he has done you can count on me

Id: [0x000F7BBC]
Sorry i don't have time to talk right now i have to go back to my home as fast as possible

Id: [0x000F7BBD]
This must be the solar clock depicted in the blacksmith's tomb!

Id: [0x000F7BC8]
What is this place? It seems ancient

Id: [0x000F7BCB]
Is that for Phoxidas? A gift?

Id: [0x000F7BCC]
No, it's a relic. I don't want to talk about it Damastes.

Id: [0x000F7BCD]
Isn't that Bayek's? Let me have it, I'll give it to Phoxidas myself. He loves these things.

Id: [0x000F7BD7]
Keep this area sealed off.

Id: [0x000F7BE3]
Yes, got one! 

Id: [0x000F7BE4]
Another one down

Id: [0x000F7BEB]
Is-is that him?

Id: [0x000F7BEC]
I should try to find that fresco

Id: [0x000F7BF3]
Report back on the hour.

Id: [0x000F7BF4]
Remember, she's dangerous! Take all precautions!

Id: [0x000F7BF5]
Any results from the house-to-house search?

Id: [0x000F7BF6]
I have a soldier who hasn't reported back.

Id: [0x000F7BF7]
All men are not accounted for!

Id: [0x000F7C08]
Hotephres? What is going on?

Id: [0x000F7C09]
You are a pig. I was bored anyway. Thanks for the wine.

Id: [0x000F7C0B]
Then stop being useless. Be angry. Pick up your sword and start fighting.

Id: [0x000F7C95]
The Mouse will embrace you! As a sign of my undying gratitude.

Id: [0x000F7C97]
Please don't!

Id: [0x000F7C98]
Take care of yourself Mouse, try not to get caught in any more traps.

Id: [0x000F7C99]
Ah such grace, such wit! You deserve more than mere money. Come see me again later, I will find you something special from my stash.

Id: [0x000F7C9C]
We're not done!

Id: [0x000F7CC3]
Slow down and tell me what happened, Mouse.

Id: [0x000F7CC4]
They wouldn't listen! They accused me of killing Paulus Aurelius, the money lender, gutted like a pig. Red hair in his fist… not my hair.

Id: [0x000F7CC6]
But the Romans will not believe a cripple and an Egyptian.

Id: [0x000F7CCF]
Welcome to the Wolf's Den, sir! The best and cleanest girls this side of Rome.

Id: [0x000F7CD0]
I am looking for a particular girl. Vesta?

Id: [0x000F7CD2]
Vesta? None of that name here, sir. But we have many other beautiful companions? Ready to fulfil your wildest dreams.

Id: [0x000F7CD3]
I am not buying what you're selling, boy.

Id: [0x000F7CD5]
That smell...the same perfume from the victims?

Id: [0x000F7CE8]
He...he...

Id: [0x000F7CE9]
You're safe now.

Id: [0x000F7CEA]
That boy, was it a boy? She lured me here, and then this hideous thing? A bastard familia. Screaming at me, saying I was his father?

Id: [0x000F7CEB]
Did he also kill the woman?

Id: [0x000F7CEC]
His mother. Infamia. I'm ashamed to say I loved her once. But I was not his father.

Id: [0x000F7CED]
You're lucky, he killed the other men he seduced.

Id: [0x000F7CEE]
I didn;t touch him! Please, I must get out of here.

Id: [0x000F7CEF]
Do you know Diocles? Go to him and tell what happened here. An innocent man can yet be saved.

Id: [0x000F7CFD]
And my duty as a husband.

Id: [0x000F7CFE]
He's a merchant somewhere in this marketplace.

Id: [0x000F7D0E]
I'm not blind. I see the skerries.

Id: [0x000F7D0F]
Your third voyage, and already you bark like command crew.

Id: [0x000F7D10]
I enjoy watching spittle get caught in your beard, Phoxidas.

Id: [0x000F7D1E]
I cannot worry about that now. If things do not change, the crops will rot and we will starve!

Id: [0x000F7D25]
Neb, you look strong, and carry yourself without fear. Can you help a poor farmer?

Id: [0x000F7D26]
Your friend was killed by a hippo.

Id: [0x000F7D27]
Yes! The beasts' rampage slaughtered many!

Id: [0x000F7D28]
Yesterday, we were attacked by bandits. In their wake, they disturbed these hippos, and drove them into our fields. The gods seem content to piss on us.

Id: [0x000F7D29]
Let me help you collect the dead.

Id: [0x000F7D31]
No, not Meketre.

Id: [0x000F7D32]
But where is Meketre? What will we do without my cherished Meketre?

Id: [0x000F7D4B]
Maybe the lash will loosen your tongue.

Id: [0x000F7D4E]
Enough! My workers are not to blame. Send me some soldiers with half a brain, or we'll never find my dioptra.

Id: [0x000F7D4F]
General Agrippa will hear of this! A Roman standing up for Egyptians! Pathetic!

Id: [0x000F7D54]
You are far from Egypt, Medjay. Like me and my beloved Hapti.

Id: [0x000F7D60]
I am sorry. There was a rebellion at the quarry, he…

Id: [0x000F7D61]
No, I don't want to know. He was always so hotheaded. How could he leave us this way?

Id: [0x000F7D62]
I found his bracelet, he meant for you to have it.

Id: [0x000F7D63]
What good is a bracelet? My child will grow up without a father. Thank you for telling me, you're a good man. But please, leave me alone to my grief.

Id: [0x000F7D71]
This is not over.

Id: [0x000F7D78]
You must understand, the temple has not been a place of healing for a while.

Id: [0x000F7D79]
How does this stand?

Id: [0x000F7D7A]
Roman rule, my friend.

Id: [0x000F7D7B]
So your clinic...?

Id: [0x000F7D7C]
Tries to help those who need it most. The poor, the sick, the infirm.

Id: [0x000F7D7D]
A noble cause.

Id: [0x000F7D7E]
I detect a touch of the cynic?

Id: [0x000F7D7F]
I have reason to be suspicious of most people's motives.

Id: [0x000F7DA0]
So you have the truth, Eagle.

Id: [0x000F7DA1]
What truth is that? That you are a parasite? A vampire who feeds on the superstitions of desperate people?

Id: [0x000F7DA5]
And as the saviour of Cyrene, you have come to exact justice on their behalf?

Id: [0x000F7DA6]
I am not the savoir of Cyrene.

Id: [0x000F7DA7]
No, but still you come to kill me, an unarmed priest.

Id: [0x000F7DA9]
As I thought?

Id: [0x000F7DAD]
An eagle would tear apart its prey with no thought, feast upon its flesh. So what now? You bring me to the Romans for trial? Leander sanctioned everything, don't you understand? You have no talons, Eagle. So leave me and scuttle back to saving farmers and whores.

Id: [0x000F7DAF]
And Zeus will strike down the owl...

Id: [0x000F7E9C]
Hmm. Poor cousin.

Id: [0x000F7E9D]
Is it him?

Id: [0x000F7E9E]
No, not Meketre.<LF>

Id: [0x000F7EA0]
No, not him.

Id: [0x000F7EB0]
I would help you, but I am no match for those beasts.

Id: [0x000F7EB3]
Hmm.

Id: [0x000F7EB4]
Is this Meketre?

Id: [0x000F7EB5]
Not this. This is my wife's brother's son. He was a fool. A brave fool. But a fool.

Id: [0x000F7EB6]
My poor Meketre is-is gone!

Id: [0x000F7EB9]
The last one, I think.

Id: [0x000F7EBA]
And Meketre not among them.

Id: [0x000F7EBB]
What will I do now?

Id: [0x000F7EC0]
Our protector. Brave and strong, like you! He would chase away fierce animals, or the bandits who plague us.

Id: [0x000F7EC1]
I guess there is no one left who can keep us safe...

Id: [0x000F7EC2]
Such are a curse upon all of Egypt, it seems. Where do these bandits roost?

Id: [0x000F7EC3]
There is a canyon. I would take you there, but it is far too dangerous... also, someone must deal with the dead.

Id: [0x000F7EC4]
Of course... I will find it.

Id: [0x000F7EC6]
Will I ever see my dear Meketre again?

Id: [0x000F7EC7]
You can go to Heliopolis, I'll join you there

Id: [0x000F7EC8]
Don't wait for me

Id: [0x000F7EC9]
Go on ahead, I'll meet you at Heliopolis

Id: [0x000F7ECD]
Psst! Will you free me?

Id: [0x000F7ED5]
The bandits are known as the Hungry Great Ones. May the gods protect you!

Id: [0x000F7EDF]
Do not fault in your charge!

Id: [0x000F7EE0]
Mars himself fights with us!

Id: [0x000F7EE1]
Destroy them all!

Id: [0x000F7EE6]
To me, men!

Id: [0x000F7EE7]
Drive a wedge through them.

Id: [0x000F7EE8]
Destroy these cowards and dungherders!

Id: [0x000F7EEC]
You lose ground, you heartless bastards!

Id: [0x000F7EED]
Flee while you still can!

Id: [0x000F7EEE]
Not a one of of you can stay my blade.

Id: [0x000F7EEF]
Keep on men, we will defeat them.

Id: [0x000F7EF1]
Feel the blood rush, Bayek! And know that Mars himself drives your blade!

Id: [0x000F7EF5]
That's it! Cut through the middle.

Id: [0x000F7EF6]
Rome sends her regards.

Id: [0x000F7EF7]
Prepare for your judgement!

Id: [0x000F7EF9]
Keep pressing on! We have them!

Id: [0x000F7EFF]
They went too far, in Siwa. I knew it then, but I just wanted peace for Egypt.

Id: [0x000F7F01]
My fee is covered it seems. Now may I go to my glory.

Id: [0x000F7F04]
There is no glory left in Egypt.

Id: [0x000F7F13]
Bayek of Siwa. We finally fight. Are you ready for your end?

Id: [0x000F7F14]
Prepare to face judgement, Septimius. You will find yourself in The Duat soon.

Id: [0x000F7F16]
Is that all your fury, Medjay? No wonder it was so easy to take your country.

Id: [0x000F7F17]
Keep talking, dog. You will find my fury soon.

Id: [0x000F7F1C]
Gods take you.

Id: [0x000F7F1D]
Stay down.

Id: [0x000F7F1E]
Give up now! I will claim you died a hero, and not a traitor.

Id: [0x000F7F1F]
Cease your baseless attempts to fight.

Id: [0x000F7F21]
I will rip your heart out and feed it to crocodiles, Septimius.

Id: [0x000F7F22]
You call this an attack?

Id: [0x000F7F23]
You will face judgement, Septimius.

Id: [0x000F7F4C]
Gladly.

Id: [0x000F7F60]
I will follow you, Zahra. We have to protect this land.

Id: [0x000F7F74]
This jar doesn't belong here. I think there's movement inside!

Id: [0x000F7F92]
Fresh fruit, grain, wine. These must be gifts from the Caretaker to his men.

Id: [0x000F7F93]
Another shrine to the snake goddess Wadjet.

Id: [0x000F7FDB]
Steady... Steady...

Id: [0x000F7FDD]
The play you are witnessing below is Menander's Dyskolos, more commonly known as The Grouch, a late entry in the Greek comedies.

Id: [0x000F7FDF]
I feared the worst.

Id: [0x000F7FE0]
Theodoros is a resilient son of bitch.

Id: [0x000F7FE1]
Knowing him, he's already preparing something. He won't let Derratos get away.

Id: [0x000F7FE2]
Well after the glory of Athens had faded and just before Rome at last conquered Egypt, Alexandria had acquired great riches and renown. The city's reputation would attract settlers, warriors and scientists from the Mediterranean basin, and beyond.

Id: [0x000F7FE4]
While Egyptians also lived in Alexandria, and influenced it greatly, the city's dominant lifestyle was largely Hellenistic. This was reflected though the city's cultural and juridical system, and the introduction of the slave system.

Id: [0x000F7FE7]
This was a large number considering there were roughly three million inhabitants in the country during Cleopatra's reign.

Id: [0x000F7FE8]
Alexandria also had a large slave population consisting mostly of Greek slaves forced into domesticity, or into servitude in the multiple workshops of the city. Slave by birth, many were descendants of former prisoners of war, or orphans.

Id: [0x000F7FEC]
But the space was not reserved exclusively for entertainment. To those who could participate in the democratic system of the time, the theater was also where local popular assemblies met.

Id: [0x000F7FED]
These town representatives were usually chosen by lottery, and only served for one year. They would meet to discuss local affairs, and make decisions specific to city management.

Id: [0x000F7FEE]
Roman theaters were usually semi-circular and built from scratch on a flat area with structures designed to enhance oration.

Id: [0x000F7FEF]
Greek theaters were more oblong in shape, similar to a horseshoe and favored the slopes of natural hills to support their acoustics.

Id: [0x000F7FF0]
References in other manuscripts allow us to infer that the Dyskolos was one of the most popular plays in Greece and Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic era.

Id: [0x000F7FF1]
Known as one of the largest buildings of its kind, the Alexandria gymnasium also had a running track – known as palestra – arranged alongside the structure.

Id: [0x000F7FF2]
Gymnasiums typically hosted wrestling events, and other sports which didn't require wide spaces such as archery and javelin throwing.

Id: [0x000F7FF4]
As with the theater, gymnasiums also served another function – that of court of law. Here the Dikasterion, meaning jury assembly, would gather to participate in trials.

Id: [0x000F7FF5]
It is also here that Cleopatra and Caesarion, her son and co-regent, were crowned in 34 BC.

Id: [0x000F7FFB]
We made the choice to show both genders attending class within the context of the game world. Even though it is historically inaccurate, we felt it was not necessary to prioritize historical sexism over inclusive gameplay.

Id: [0x000F7FFD]
It was built on an artificially constructed hill. The area was filled with gardens, and contained a grotto sanctuary.

Id: [0x000F7FFE]
As with the gymnasium, the Paneion was considered one of the architectural wonders of Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F8000]
He was associated with shepherds, flocks, rustic music. As such, he was worshipped in more natural environments such as caves or grottos.

Id: [0x000F8001]
It is likely that Mediterranean cults adopted the imagery of Pan to symbolize the Christian devil.

Id: [0x000F8005]
Because of these heavy impositions, fraud and inability to pay taxes were common.

Id: [0x000F800A]
A tremendous amount of materials and goods flowed through the city on a daily basis. The large port market was called the Emporion. It was there that merchandise was traded by naukleros, the ship-owners.

Id: [0x000F800B]
The ports of Alexandria were a major commerce hub, effectively connecting Egypt with the Mediterranean regions.

Id: [0x000F800C]
Alexandria also had a slave market of which Rome was the best client.

Id: [0x000F800D]
Food and other artisan work streamed out of Egypt; ceramics, glass, potteries, golden rings, linen and mint coinage.

Id: [0x000F800E]
In return, resources that could not be produced locally were imported. This includes materials such as pine wood from Syria, iron and marble from the Greek islands, gold from Spain, and exotic fruits from Europe.

Id: [0x000F800F]
The centerpiece of Alexandria's wealth was the royal systematisation of taxes on almost everything. Basic items such as salt, oil, beer, wheat and linen were heavily taxed.

Id: [0x000F8010]
The royal treasury of Alexandria provided a great flow of economy in most administrative areas of Egypt.

Id: [0x000F8011]
In subsequent centuries, Egypt retained a prominent place within the Roman Empire thanks to Alexandria, which was the second largest port city of the empire.

Id: [0x000F8015]
The wood imported through this location was used in the nearby shipyards, where most of Egypt's ships were built.

Id: [0x000F8016]
Employing tens of thousands of ship builders, it contributed to the renown of the Egyptian fleet as one of the mightiest of the era

Id: [0x000F8017]
The canal came through Alexandria from the Nile, and was a man-made artifact created specifically to connect to the Mediterranean.

Id: [0x000F8018]
Save for a branch angling westward, its size in the Ptolemaic era was roughly 40 to 50 km, from north to south.

Id: [0x000F8019]
During the 19th century, attempts were made to refill the basin with seawater.

Id: [0x000F801A]
In modern times it is being kept alive through irrigation. However, only about 17% of its original size remains, spread out across many subdivisions between roads and canals.

Id: [0x000F801C]
This area's style is strongly influenced by the dye baths and tanneries of modern day Fes, in Morocco, which helped us envision what these locations might have been like in ancient Egypt.

Id: [0x000F801D]
Leather was reserved mainly for things such as sandals, leather bags, dagger sheaths, quivers, etc.

Id: [0x000F801E]
Leopard hides, unlike regular leather, were highly valued and usually worn by priests.

Id: [0x000F8020]
Fibers were usually dyed before weaving. While color was used with textiles, dyes weren't commonly used for clothing and most Egyptians wore white. The color represented spiritual purity, a goal to reach for every day of one's mortal life.

Id: [0x000F8022]
The plant was cultivated for this purpose within the Nile Delta, and allowed for the creation of various colors. For example, different maceration times of the leaves would result in colors ranging from red to green, while adding in limestone shifted it to blue.

Id: [0x000F8023]
During the Greco-Roman period other ingredients were found, resulting in a wider range of colors.

Id: [0x000F8026]
It is unknown exactly when Jews first arrived in Egypt, though it is confirmed they were present since Ptolemy Soter's rule, first of the Ptolemies.

Id: [0x000F8027]
Alexandrian Jews made up to a third of the city's population, and were known as Ioudaioi. They were granted two of the five district of the city. This was due to the Ptolemies wanting to keep their laws pure from indigenous influence.

Id: [0x000F8028]
While they lived in the front wards of the city for some time, they were eventually forced in the delta districts at the beginning of the Roman presence.

Id: [0x000F8034]
It was one of the most important shipping entrance to Alexandria, and often hosted processions and festivals.

Id: [0x000F8035]
This is likely because Canopic Way was made in a short span of time and based on an urban plan, as opposed to being slowly built over time as was usual for the era.

Id: [0x000F8037]
Greek obelisks were highly prized by the Roman, who integrated the architecture to their own designs.

Id: [0x000F8041]
Where Greeks used to have marbles, limestone was instead used for the statues and monuments of Alexandria. Limestone was widely available in Egypt, whereas marble had to be imported, and was thus very expensive.

Id: [0x000F8043]
These cults went on to influence Roman culture, and afterwards, various European populations in general.

Id: [0x000F8045]
It also had a notable impact on Romans rituals later on, despite there being no practical aspect to the process for the.

Id: [0x000F8047]
While the Roman favored use of a single monument, Egyptian obelisks tended to come in pairs and were generally located at the entrance of temples.

Id: [0x000F8048]
Several ancient Egyptian obelisks are still in existence today, though many are spread out across the world in locations such as Rome, New York and London.

Id: [0x000F804A]
Alexandrians had their own Olympic games called Is-Olympics. These included music, gymnastics, athletics, archery, and equestrian events.

Id: [0x000F804B]
We know of many hippodromes across Egypt, most notably in Alexandria, Krokodilopolis, and Memphis.

Id: [0x000F804D]
Due to technical constraints in the game, we chose to relocate it from south of the Serapeion to east of the city walls, where a smaller racing track was situated.

Id: [0x000F804F]
The races, restricted to the elite, were sponsored by various dignitaries. The victors were crowned with garlands of olive and received prize money, but the most sought after reward was to be acclaimed by the works of poets such as Kallimachos and Pindar.

Id: [0x000F8066]
Bayek of Siwa. I've been waiting for you. 

Id: [0x000F8067]
You know me? 

Id: [0x000F8068]
Your reputation preceeds you. I must ask for your assistance. 

Id: [0x000F8069]
*sigh* I'm afraid I'm quite

Id: [0x000F806A]
Preoccupied, I know. but I must ask none the less. 

Id: [0x000F806B]
You see, here, in this place, the waters of the Great Nile are nearing the time of the flood. This celebrated event cleanses the lands and purifies its people. But this year, I'm afraid that will not happen. 

Id: [0x000F806C]
And why not? 

Id: [0x000F806D]
The heathens of the  south have stolen our conduit. Without this, the waters will rage out of control and destroy everything. you must help us recover what was stolen.

Id: [0x000F806E]
Travel south. Please Bayek of Siwa. You must help us. 

Id: [0x000F806F]
Here is an example of such a poem.

Id: [0x000F8070]
Everyone Stop!! Leave the stranger be!!

Id: [0x000F8071]
You! with me. We must speak.

Id: [0x000F8077]
Please find my son

Id: [0x000F8078]
Tell my son to come home

Id: [0x000F807A]
Oh no... What happened?

Id: [0x000F807B]
You're back! Well, look at this!

Id: [0x000F8087]
You're Bayek, yes? Aya is eager to see you.

Id: [0x000F8092]
Child! What are you doing here? 

Id: [0x000F8093]
These men took me! I come from a village not far north. 

Id: [0x000F8094]
The fishing village? You are... the conduit? 

Id: [0x000F8095]
Did sister send you!!??

Id: [0x000F8096]
Shh! We'll talk later. Come. Follow me. 

Id: [0x000F80CF]
Sister! SISTER!!

Id: [0x000F80D0]
Nour? Nour!! You're back!!

Id: [0x000F80D1]
Thanks to this man here!

Id: [0x000F80D2]
Thank you Bayek. We are indebted to you. May the Gods keep you in their thoughts. 

Id: [0x000F80D6]
Those who do this deserve death. How can this be happening in Egypt? By the gods, it must be stopped!

Id: [0x000F80DB]
Crocodiles are being slaughtered and mummified. The work is sloppy and careless. This is sacrilege beyond imagining.

Id: [0x000F80DC]
The mummies are used as coin sacks, then stacked like packages. They are using the bodies of murdered gods for smuggling! Amun! The smell alone turns my stomach.

Id: [0x000F80DD]
We are the future here. You should not have meddled!

Id: [0x000F80DE]
Cut him off! Flank him!

Id: [0x000F80DF]
You filthy infidel! By what right do you touch me. I'm Sobek's chosen vessel. His right hand! Who are you!

Id: [0x000F80E0]
You're nothing but a murderer. And I am the hand of justice.

Id: [0x000F80E5]
Hello ground.

Id: [0x000F80EB]
I followed you the whole way!

Id: [0x000F80FA]
She is in hiding.

Id: [0x000F80FC]
Greeting, Miss Najem. Very impressive work. 

Id: [0x000F80FD]
... and you are?

Id: [0x000F80FE]
Oh! Forgive me. My name is Miles. William Miles. 

Id: [0x000F80FF]
k...

Id: [0x000F8100]
I'm also have the honor of occupying the position on leader of the Assassins. 

Id: [0x000F8101]
You can continue your work if you wish. Those Abstergo grunts wont be bothering you anymore. 

Id: [0x000F8105]
Do I walk among the dead now?

Id: [0x000F8106]
I just want my daughter back... Please!?

Id: [0x000F8109]
It makes no difference now. I wanted to protect my daughter in life and death. I have done neither...

Id: [0x000F8112]
Where is he?

Id: [0x000F811C]
Someone left a note here. "I told you I would return. Meet me at the pyramid" 

Id: [0x000F811D]
What?

Id: [0x000F811E]
A ptolemaic spear. This is not good.

Id: [0x000F811F]
Broken pottery, people fought here.

Id: [0x000F812B]
The House of Nef is near the river.

Id: [0x000F8132]
Who was he?

Id: [0x000F8136]
Nef. The children called him Father. This is his house. This is his house! [wince of pain]

Id: [0x000F8137]
I don't give a shit.

Id: [0x000F813A]
I can go alone. No need for you to bloody yourself further.

Id: [0x000F8140]
Destroy her name, Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F8152]
Sobek priests conspiring with Ptolemy's soldiers and poisoners? What are they up to?

Id: [0x000F8156]
A poisonous little woman. Talented, but twisted.

Id: [0x000F816D]
Correspondence between the Captain and Sehetep. Sehetep again! That poisonous priest from the northern temple is becoming a big problem.

Id: [0x000F81CC]
Enough for you? I will press him for more information. I suggest you visit the brothel in town.

Id: [0x000F81CE]
Yes, go dig through this Dionysian town and unearth the plot against us.

Id: [0x000F81D2]
It is a mess of political intrigue. She will explain all, fear not.

Id: [0x000F81D9]
Yes my Queen. Bayek, if we don't get to Pompey first, Septimius might.

Id: [0x000F81DB]
An unceremonious removal.

Id: [0x000F81DC]
Looks like we missed the boat.

Id: [0x000F81E2]
Funny how all great men are reduced to food for maggots.

Id: [0x000F8254]
The knowledge of the entire world is at your fingertips! Here, one can reflect upon the oppressive regime under which we find ourselves laboring!

Id: [0x000F8699]
Did we find the ledger?

Id: [0x000F869A]
Not yet, but it won't be long. The captain is upstairs questioning the servant.

Id: [0x000F869B]
Stupid Egyptian vlakos. Khenut is a marked woman. Loyalty to her will get them killed.

Id: [0x000F86A3]
They are breeding the snakes here. Gods, I hate snakes!

Id: [0x000F86A4]
Gah! A snake! The jars have been used to transport them.

Id: [0x000F86A7]
Our new champion! Soon your heroic image will be guarding these gates! But not too soon. I need time to get the strength in your brow just right. Don't rush an artist!

Id: [0x000F86B1]
How many weeks have they been shouting at the gates? Still nothing changes. Nothing is done. Greeks just take and take.

Id: [0x000F86B3]
Eventually all of Faiyum will belong to the greedy overlords. I am glad I will not live long enough to see it.

Id: [0x000F86CE]
Horns of Bacchus! It is it!

Id: [0x000F86CF]
All right, Beast, let's get down to it.

Id: [0x000F86DF]
The Alexandrian Poets, have I mentioned them? ...Are a group of dramatic artists dedicated to promoting free thinking throughout the land, no matter what the pharaoh says.

Id: [0x000F86E0]
Woah, wait...I did not realize you Siwans knew so much about the theatre.

Id: [0x000F86E1]
I thought you did not like this Phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F86E6]
Where is this delivery headed?

Id: [0x000F86E7]
To Yamu, for the Sekhmet ceremony. Get them sealed up and on the cart.

Id: [0x000F86EF]
You are the Medjay from Siwa? I thought Medjays were supposed to protect the pharaoh?

Id: [0x000F86F0]
I am Medjay to no pharaoh.

Id: [0x000F86F2]
You see this?

Id: [0x000F86F4]
We will find you. We will find you, in your sleep!

Id: [0x000F86FA]
Sleep? I never sleep. I just wait. In the shadows. And I will kill you all. Everyone who sniffed the air that day in Siwa.

Id: [0x000F8700]
Gennadios?

Id: [0x000F8701]
Ah! Interested in Homeric verse, eh? This way, please.

Id: [0x000F870D]
Did you see the fat guy they caught?

Id: [0x000F870E]
He somehow managed to get inside to the treasure room and started talking to the boss about some goddes this shrine belonged to.

Id: [0x000F870F]
Oh ! Really?

Id: [0x000F8710]
Yes! Can you imagine it - a guy in a togga strolling through the whole cam like it's nobody's business.

Id: [0x000F8711]
I'm gonna piss myself - how is this even possible? Did they kill him?

Id: [0x000F8712]
Nope. The boss said he liked him and to be honest I don't know what he wants to do with him. Make him tell stories?

Id: [0x000F8713]
The days we are living in...

Id: [0x000F8740]
You have an easy life, yes? Go from place to place, see the world…

Id: [0x000F8741]
Would you accept me as a traveling companion? I will take a new title! How about… Thutmose the Fearsome?

Id: [0x000F874D]
Apollodorus tells me it is a papyrus from the Royal Council. Which means the Snake is in Ptolemy's court.

Id: [0x000F8750]
How does this Apollodorus know these things?

Id: [0x000F8751]
He has informants everywhere. Because of his work with Cleopatra.

Id: [0x000F8753]
I will go to the palace and discover who uses the seal of the snake, and I will use this.

Id: [0x000F876B]
I cannot leave here as long as Gennadios walks the streets. He is determined to kill me.

Id: [0x000F876C]
In addition to the Snake, I will see what I can learn of this Gennadios and silence him.

Id: [0x000F8774]
Discover who the Snake is and show him the face of death. I'll meet you at the Paneum when you have killed both the Snake and Gennadios.

Id: [0x000F8781]
[gasps of fear, panting]

Id: [0x000F878D]
Pash…

Id: [0x000F8794]
Crocodiles aren't dogs, you know. (humming to herself) Killing them is easy; not killing them is much harder.

Id: [0x000F879F]
(Waking up grasping air)

Id: [0x000F87A5]
[giggling]

Id: [0x000F87A9]
Every morning of my childhood, my father and I spoke the Prayer of the Medjay, a promise to those in need.

Id: [0x000F87AA]
"I am a Medjay."

Id: [0x000F87AB]
"I am a feather in the eagle's wing… a living dagger, plunged from the sky into the heart of chaos."

Id: [0x000F87AC]
"I am a truth unknown… a scabbard unfilled… a son of the Nile… and a defender of the people." 

Id: [0x000F87AD]
"You cannot kill me, for I walk among the dead. Come forth by day, and I will guide you home."

Id: [0x000F87AE]
My son should have learned this prayer from me.​

Id: [0x000F87BF]
Where is that damn girl!?

Id: [0x000F87CA]
Told her to hurry back...

Id: [0x000F87CC]
Ruia, where have you got to?

Id: [0x000F8A35]
Your daughter is dead, Khaliset. Nothing will return her. Nothing can.

Id: [0x000F8A4E]
I will save my daughter no matter the cost. Enough of your pointless words!

Id: [0x000F8A51]
Then heed my weapon instead, Hyena.

Id: [0x000F8A55]
Some came between the gods and us. It is their gift.

Id: [0x000F8A8F]
No matter. Join us at the tavern later!

Id: [0x000F8A98]
I suppose you want the same fate as Ruia, you stupid Egyptian. I'll teach you the same lesson she learned!

Id: [0x000F8A99]
Come. Try.

Id: [0x000F8A9A]
The beer hits harder than you.

Id: [0x000F8AB3]
We cannot traipse into the palace armed to the teeth.

Id: [0x000F8ACA]
Thank you Diocles. It is time for my son to enter The Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x000F8AFE]
Your letter.

Id: [0x000F8B00]
Why was she killed?

Id: [0x000F8B21]
This sarcophagus is decorated with goddesses of the mother. Strange symbols are marked all over it.

Id: [0x000F8B31]
Now you are just trying to impress me...

Id: [0x000F8B50]
No! I gathered the silica for them -- it powered the magic stone of Those Who Came Before.

Id: [0x000F8B5E]
A letter to Eudoros. He spends most of his time at the baths just as Aya said.

Id: [0x000F8B72]
Who is the Snake?

Id: [0x000F8B73]
I have yet to discover that.

Id: [0x000F8B74]
The clue must be there in the palace. Search for the seal found upon the letter.

Id: [0x000F8B76]
A just end. You defiled the dead and enabled the people who killed my son. All on a selfish whim.

Id: [0x000F8B79]
Don't worry Aya, I'll be on my best behaviour.

Id: [0x000F8B8A]
I am Bayek, a Medjay.

Id: [0x000F8B8C]
That's an invitation.

Id: [0x000F8B8F]
What is this place? It stinks of death. This must be where all the body parts are coming from.

Id: [0x000F8B90]
What is this sickening place? It stinks of death. Gods! Those are bodies, mangled beyond recognition.

Id: [0x000F8B91]
Friends! I trust you enjoyed the show?

Id: [0x000F8B98]
Unfortunately, the next show may be delayed. I've only found one... participant. It may take time to find more.

Id: [0x000F8B99]
I don't know if I should say this, I wouldn't want you to think me odd.

Id: [0x000F8B9A]
You're among friends, dear.

Id: [0x000F8B9B]
Well, have you considered using people from the slums? The Faiyum has no lack of them. They're of no real use.

Id: [0x000F8B9D]
Do people really enjoy this?

Id: [0x000F8B9E]
Boring. Unoriginal. Bland.

Id: [0x000F8B9F]
Krokodilopolis doesn't understand true spectacle. Such entertainment is for children.

Id: [0x000F8BB1]
It is an honor to be greeted by soldiers with such fine regalia. We are not accustomed to it.

Id: [0x000F8BB4]
The letter you recovered, it is information for Apollodorus. I will make sure he gets it.

Id: [0x000F8BB5]
We must all do what we can to help Cleopatra's cause. She alone cares for all the people of Egypt.

Id: [0x000F8BD2]
We've been hired to bribe Pompey, to save a Queen, and to win a kingdom. The usual fare for us mercenaries.

Id: [0x000F8BD3]
An alliance with Cleopatra is a union of true power. She wants more than an ally. She seeks a King.

Id: [0x000F8BD4]
Agreed. My fleet will soon be ready for Egypt.

Id: [0x000F8BDC]
Enough Phox. It is time to make war.

Id: [0x000F8BE1]
I will take care of this. Destiny is a fucker sometimes Aya. Enjoy the calm water. I will stay in the st--

Id: [0x000F8BFE]
Bayek, did you find it, did you find my formula?

Id: [0x000F8C01]
Or any day I hope. And General Agrippa?

Id: [0x000F8C02]
He did not give it up willingly.

Id: [0x000F8C04]
(Sigh) He was a good Roman. But he never understood that doesn't mean you cannot be a good man.

Id: [0x000F8C07]
It will end with their own. But you are a good man Vitruvius. I have seen that in your words and deeds.

Id: [0x000F8C08]
I am trying to be. Thank you again, Bayek of Siwa, you are a true protector of your people.

Id: [0x000F8C0D]
It is not meant for us.

Id: [0x000F8C0E]
You saw it, didn't you? The symbols only needed to be learned.

Id: [0x000F8C0F]
We cannot afford to spill any Roman blood.

Id: [0x000F8C11]
Armed or not, they will recognize her.

Id: [0x000F8C14]
My wretched brother, he's let the wine go to vinegar... and my kingdom, to pieces.

Id: [0x000F8C15]
Great Lady. Your audacity is equaled only by your beauty.

Id: [0x000F8C16]
Guard! Kill these traitors!

Id: [0x000F8C19]
I can offer you what my brother failed at with me. Marriage. A true marriage, that is.

Id: [0x000F8C1A]
If you ally with my sister, I will kill every last Roman in Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F8C1B]
Enough of the big words, little brother.

Id: [0x000F8C1D]
Out, all. You will each be sent for when our congress is concluded. I wish to hear both Ptolemies' side of the story.

Id: [0x000F8C20]
You proved your worth tenfold today. You truly are great Medjays.

Id: [0x000F8C21]
This man's luck ran out... what happened here?

Id: [0x000F8C22]
Shot while his back was turned; maybe he was trying to run.

Id: [0x000F8C23]
Ptolemaic Arrows... Was this an execution?

Id: [0x000F8C24]
The victim received this letter from a certain John Doe.

Id: [0x000F8C25]
This John Doe mentioned in the letter deserves retribution for his barbaric actions.

Id: [0x000F8C60]
So much blood.

Id: [0x000F8C90]
A farmer warrior with a Duat wish. Fine, let us dance together.

Id: [0x000F8C92]
He already told us this would happen. We know what to do.

Id: [0x000F8C97]
Old mementoes and trinkets. These look personal. All of them are marked by fire.

Id: [0x000F8C99]
This was not their leader. The Son of Ra, their real leader, has been giving orders from prison. He's being held by soldiers at a nearby Caravanserai.

Id: [0x000F8C9B]
Are you Kade? Your mother sent me to find you.

Id: [0x000F8C9C]
By Iset, is that you Bayek of Siwa? Let me out and I'll help you kill those Roman vultures.

Id: [0x000F8CD1]
What?! Sehetep is Sobek's right hand! He would never do this! What you are saying is blasphemy!

Id: [0x000F8CD9]
Be careful. Those bandits are really mean!

Id: [0x000F8CDB]
Not quite. You should go to your brothers.

Id: [0x000F8CDC]
Wait for me here. I'll see if I can convince them to hand them over.

Id: [0x000F8CDD]
Well, between the two of us, you are the best to do so!

Id: [0x000F8CE1]
What is it?

Id: [0x000F8CEE]
Your whore of a wife is a murderess! Willfully and wantonly. I did my duty as a phylakitai[fih-LAH-kee-tie]. And for this you have taken my life.

Id: [0x000F8CF0]
Why have you dragged me into the land of the dead?

Id: [0x000F8D1F]
What can we do? Are our offerings not enough?

Id: [0x000F8D20]
There he is! For Sehetep! That is the meddling Medjay!

Id: [0x000F8D34]
Sehetep again! His sticky fingers are everywhere. He's becoming a serious problem.

Id: [0x000F8D36]
Sehetep. He was the priest at the temple. Gods, what is it with priests and money?

Id: [0x000F8D37]
The poison was just for show. At least the temple crocodiles are not going to die. I should tell the guardian.

Id: [0x000F8D3C]
It is done. Faith turns to treachery far too often it seems. I should meet Padiaset.

Id: [0x000F8D3D]
It was an accident, actually. They looked so pretty, I thought they'd taste good. My other dogs… ok. They were research.

Id: [0x000F8D3E]
Sehetep will be happy, anyway. (humming to herself) The people were terrified! The crocodiles will miraculously recover, and he'll get his offerings.

Id: [0x000F8D41]
Forgive me. I must return. I need to pray for guidance.

Id: [0x000F8D48]
My warriors were thwarted but I shall not be.

Id: [0x000F8D49]
Do you think he tried to stop them?

Id: [0x000F8D4A]
More corpses this way...

Id: [0x000F8D4B]
No...please no...

Id: [0x000F8D4C]
Hepzefa, it's me Bayek!

Id: [0x000F8D4D]
Please answer me!

Id: [0x000F8D4E]
Shit-giving is my job.

Id: [0x000F8D52]
Be sure you are ready before you go.

Id: [0x000F8D53]
Are you ready? It is a long journey.

Id: [0x000F8D57]
My brother Septimius killed your son and I don't give a shit.

Id: [0x000F8D5B]
I am wounded Aya! Protect the Queen!

Id: [0x000F8D5F]
Just a flesh wound.

Id: [0x000F8D62]
You two, go ahead and tell him we are coming.

Id: [0x000F8D63]
Septimius has beat us.

Id: [0x000F8D64]
He has arrived in Alexandria. He is guarded heavily so there's-

Id: [0x000F8D65]
Bring me to him. I will get to Caesar if I have to drag myself through the sewers of the palace.

Id: [0x000F8D68]
Mama... Papo... come watch me swim!

Id: [0x000F8D69]
Khemu...

Id: [0x000F8D6A]
Papo?

Id: [0x000F8D6B]
My son, my beautiful smiling boy.

Id: [0x000F8D6C]
I will find them all, kill them all.

Id: [0x000F8D6D]
Mama?

Id: [0x000F8D6E]
We will all be together again, one day.

Id: [0x000F8D6F]
Medunamun. That was a burden lifted from Siwa.

Id: [0x000F8D70]
The slithering fool, Eudoros. How I was deceived.

Id: [0x000F8D71]
The desert will blow in… and scatter the dream of Letopolis like dust.

Id: [0x000F8D72]
You walk among the dead now Khaliset.

Id: [0x000F8D73]
Hetepi... I have my gods, now face yours.

Id: [0x000F8D74]
Shadya! Do you remember her name now?

Id: [0x000F8D76]
A Roman?

Id: [0x000F8D77]
The end and the beginning.

Id: [0x000F8D78]
I... the first ones I sent to the Duat.

Id: [0x000F8D8B]
Wonder when was the last time anybody was here.

Id: [0x000F8D8C]
That is one impressive piece of art... all the details carved on the sides.

Id: [0x000F8D8D]
What's this?

Id: [0x000F8D8E]
Can you help me light up this place?

Id: [0x000F8D8F]
Scripture, difficult to see in the dark.

Id: [0x000F8D90]
Some kind of memorial plate?

Id: [0x000F8D91]
I would need light to see better.

Id: [0x000F8D92]
Cleopatra probably needs those lit.

Id: [0x000F8D93]
All those writings, what does it mean?

Id: [0x000F8D94]
The arrival of Alexander in Egypt.

Id: [0x000F8D95]
The creation of the layout of Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F8D96]
His passage to the oracle of Siwa.

Id: [0x000F8D97]
The coronation in Memphis.

Id: [0x000F8D98]
"Alexander arrived in Memphis, there he was welcomed as a liberator for Egypt."

Id: [0x000F8D99]
"Alexander undertook to lay out the city's general plan, sketching it out with grain."

Id: [0x000F8D9A]
"At the Siwa Oasis, Alexander was pronounced the son of Zeus by the oracle of Ammon."

Id: [0x000F8D9B]
"Passing by the great pyramids of Giza, Alexander finally reached Memphis for his coronation."

Id: [0x000F8DA4]
Ah, this is where you were hidden.

Id: [0x000F8DA8]
Shadya!

Id: [0x000F8DAA]
I did what had to be done.

Id: [0x000F8DAB]
You destroyed families.

Id: [0x000F8DB7]
…should your hearts be pure--

Id: [0x000F8DBB]
[loud, drunken snoring]

Id: [0x000F8DDF]
[shouts]

Id: [0x000F8DE6]
Hm. The letter he mentioned.

Id: [0x000F8E09]
Look at this. I took it from Actaeon.

Id: [0x000F8E0A]
I shall heal Sobek. Continue to worship!

Id: [0x000F8E13]
Looks important. Locked.

Id: [0x000F8E16]
A ladder. Hmm.

Id: [0x000F8E18]
Ah. A key.

Id: [0x000F8E19]
Bayek? My friend! My brother! Oh!

Id: [0x000F8E1C]
Argh! Snakes again! Why did it have to be snakes!

Id: [0x000F8E1F]
I already gave half my grain and a hundred flowers! Would gold be better?

Id: [0x000F8E20]
Argh, you priests! Forever holding to your superstitions. You've been told the truth. The gods themselves will judge what you do with it.

Id: [0x000F8E2A]
Done. Now to meet with my informant before the Crocodile sends more compentant men.

Id: [0x000F8E2B]
Last I heard, Hotephres was sailing the lake on his merchant ship, with a giant statue on board.

Id: [0x000F8E36]
Someone has dug their way through here. Too small for me. There must be another way around.

Id: [0x000F8E3A]
Hey! Did you feel that?

Id: [0x000F8E3B]
The goddess… a thousand ships of goddesses…

Id: [0x000F8E3C]
Your base synchronization readings just tanked. You okay in there?

Id: [0x000F8E3D]
Yes. The simulation's been interrupted, but my vitals seem fine.

Id: [0x000F8E3E]
There was a sharp spike in the data, then a sudden drop. I think… Let me check something.

Id: [0x000F8E41]
Yeah, our bandwidth is running higher. Just a touch, but higher.

Id: [0x000F8E42]
How is that even possible? You said--

Id: [0x000F8E43]
I know what I said. 

Id: [0x000F8E44]
I can't. I can't.

Id: [0x000F8E4F]
Thank you. But why did you save me?

Id: [0x000F8E50]
Your aunt spoke of your desperate straits. I would free any unjust captive, but the plight of a protector is something I cannot ignore.

Id: [0x000F8E52]
We are of the same brotherhood.

Id: [0x000F8E56]
Oh my god! What's that smoke coming from the village?!?!

Id: [0x000F8E57]
Please Bayek! Get rid of those looters!

Id: [0x000F8E5E]
The land needs more people like us.

Id: [0x000F8E65]
I would rather stick my sword down your throat.

Id: [0x000F8E66]
Those who fight me die.

Id: [0x000F8E69]
There are three shrines. One to the south, one atop the natural well, and one inside the bent pyramid.

Id: [0x000F8E6A]
My heart aches until I see you again.

Id: [0x000F8E6B]
As does mine, my love.

Id: [0x000F8E6C]
You are a fool!

Id: [0x000F8E6D]
At the temple in Siwa.

Id: [0x000F8E73]
Oh, this rotting meat gives off an attractive stench. Is someone luring predators here?

Id: [0x000F8E7D]
Bayek! You've returned to me. Are you ready to be my personal Medjay?

Id: [0x000F8E7E]
Uh, well. No, I continue, you see...

Id: [0x000F8E7F]
(Laughs) You are so gullible Bayek! I'm only happy to see you still in one piece. Best bodyguard in the city!

Id: [0x000F8E87]
Stop saying that camel shit! I'm not waiting around while you do the fighting.

Id: [0x000F8E88]
Look, it is cleaner this way. It will be easier for me to get in alone.

Id: [0x000F8E89]
Alright. Have it your way. I'll be near by.

Id: [0x000F8E8E]
Somehow he's still communicating with them. Could a normal man do that? If he is a god a cage won't stop him. Is he even still there?

Id: [0x000F8E8F]
I just finished my rounds. He is there. The Captain wants him executed, but someone higher up is protecting him.

Id: [0x000F8E90]
Then we'll have to get his followers before they get us.

Id: [0x000F8E94]
That crazy is not right in the head. Did you see his eyes? Do you think he's really the Son of Ra?

Id: [0x000F8E95]
He is a dangerous little madman. But he has got his own private army. They do whatever he says. I'm more scared of what they will do next.

Id: [0x000F8EA1]
Long live the Shadow! Long live the Poets! Long live the Republic of Shadows and Poets!

Id: [0x000F8EA2]
(Coughs)

Id: [0x000F8EA3]
(Coughs)

Id: [0x000F8EC7]
This is Brutus and Cassius. Our Roman brothers.

Id: [0x000F8ED8]
I need some things to finish a piece I'm working on. Since you wander the desert perhaps you can find a few things for Reda.

Id: [0x000F8ED9]
Sometimes these old relics need a bit of help to be perfect again, but I'm missing a few things...

Id: [0x000F8EDA]
Ah! Medjay, just the man I needed. I have the perfect thing for you, but I need a few things to fix it...

Id: [0x000F8EDB]
Ah Bayek, I need your help with something.

Id: [0x000F8EDC]
Medjay! Your help is needed. I might even owe you a favor after this.

Id: [0x000F8EE7]
Care for some dates? Finest in the area. Same ones the brewery uses for its famous beer.

Id: [0x000F8EEC]
Ah! There you are, boy!

Id: [0x000F8EED]
Let us go, [seni](my brother)!

Id: [0x000F8EEF]
Zervos? The harbor master is dead.

Id: [0x000F8EF2]
I'm looking for Zervos, the harbor master.

Id: [0x000F8EF3]
Oh! I heard Sefetu gutted him.

Id: [0x000F8EF6]
What are you looking for today?

Id: [0x000F8EF7]
The harbor master. Zervos.

Id: [0x000F8EF8]
Do not ask about him! The guards killed him!

Id: [0x000F8EF9]
I'm just looking. You know about a man named Zervos?

Id: [0x000F8EFA]
You want some fish, or what?

Id: [0x000F8F48]
He is dead. I should tell Zahra.

Id: [0x000F8F4A]
Son of Ra is dead. It was disturbing. His madness almost made sense.

Id: [0x000F8F4B]
I don't know. I am hungry though. Now we return to the farm to feast in peace.

Id: [0x000F8F4E]
Nek! You told them to murder.

Id: [0x000F8F82]
I am not sorry. Is Bayek of Siwa sorry? I lost my family, you lost your family. We have the right to do anything we want to anyone.

Id: [0x000F8F84]
Hypocrite! You can pile up one thousand dead bodies in front of me. It doesn't change me.

Id: [0x000F8F85]
No, we are different.

Id: [0x000F8F8B]
Yes! My very own Medjay! What a treat. I thought you were all buried beneath the sands of time!

Id: [0x000F8F8D]
The Goddess shall favor us, shielding us from the obscurity of chaos.

Id: [0x000F8F9E]
I know, but Giza has so much wonder, and mystery. You just have to look hard enough! And the rewards... Oh, the rewards!

Id: [0x000F8FA4]
Bodyguard. You can't leave me here!

Id: [0x000F8FA5]
Medjay, come back!

Id: [0x000F8FA6]
This is not where I told you to take me.

Id: [0x000F8FA7]
Please don't leave me.

Id: [0x000F8FAA]
Finally! You must return me as you agreed with my father.

Id: [0x000F8FAB]
Please, let us hurry home.

Id: [0x000F8FAC]
Thank you, Medjay. I was terrified.

Id: [0x000F8FB5]
Eh... Memphis?

Id: [0x000F8FB6]
Oh, of course! [Beat]Thank you.

Id: [0x000F8FD3]
Rashidi?

Id: [0x000F8FD4]
I'm here to get you out.

Id: [0x000F8FF0]
Very. [YAWN] Sorry. What are you interested in?

Id: [0x000F8FF1]
At the moment, I'm looking for Zervos.

Id: [0x000F902F]
This ring you've found is certainly sought after.

Id: [0x000F9032]
Bayek, it is finally time to celebrate with my muses.

Id: [0x000F9033]
Shouldn't you stay to oversee your actors?

Id: [0x000F9034]
We must find time to work on the next play. Bayek, you must come.

Id: [0x000F9035]
This celebration better rival my own events in Siwa.

Id: [0x000F9036]
Perhaps if your play was performed at the temples it would reach more people.

Id: [0x000F903A]
Come, Bayek! This will be an excellent night. Let us hurry! You will be our guest of honor!

Id: [0x000F903C]
I remember the celebrations we would have in my house in the better years. Ah, memories.

Id: [0x000F903D]
They have become less so of late?

Id: [0x000F903E]
These Phylakitai suffocate our celebrations. They know nothing of poets. They think they know truth…

Id: [0x000F903F]
You know it better?

Id: [0x000F9040]
Of course. Truth comes from Chaos. Not order.

Id: [0x000F9042]
Senu sees something.

Id: [0x000F9043]
Bah! There is nothing but Dionysius that way. Come, you should loosen your robes in readiness!

Id: [0x000F9045]
Ah, my home finally. Prepare yourself, Bayek. This is a night you will not forget.

Id: [0x000F9046]
It had better live up to the tales that Aya told!

Id: [0x000F904A]
This is grand, Phanos.

Id: [0x000F904B]
Bayek. Come! Enter our very own Elysian Fields!

Id: [0x000F904D]
Of course. I will go make sure he's alright. Go back to your brothers. You'll be safer with them.

Id: [0x000F904E]
My felucca is tied up at the Sais docks. I would prefer to have it back in one piece, but if you must destroy it…

Id: [0x000F9050]
Did you ever see work as fine as Onuris'?

Id: [0x000F9051]
I wish I could afford one of his weapons. Did you ever see the Serpent of Serapis? A spear light as a feather, and sharper than Sobek's tooth.

Id: [0x000F9052]
With such a spear, I could be a champion in the amphitheater!

Id: [0x000F9053]
Shame about what happened to it...

Id: [0x000F9056]
Drakon! Remember that wine is not only for you.

Id: [0x000F9057]
Welcome to the land of truth, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F9058]
I can see that, perhaps, Aya left some details out of her stories.

Id: [0x000F9059]
Indeed! This is the perfect place for artist and muse to meet!

Id: [0x000F905A]
Artemis! Do not throw fruit. This is not time for your target practice. Come, Bayek!

Id: [0x000F905C]
The celebration is inside! Hurry, Bayek! This wine will not last forever!

Id: [0x000F9061]
Gennadios! His men must have come after us.

Id: [0x000F9062]
We will deal with this, Phanos. Come, bring your blade.

Id: [0x000F907A]
Dear Amon, save me!

Id: [0x000F907C]
Get me out of here!

Id: [0x000F907E]
I have to sleep in my own filth in here!

Id: [0x000F9080]
Don't forget about me!

Id: [0x000F9086]
You have killed them all! Bastards, they deserved to die.

Id: [0x000F9098]
Here is your precious papyrus.

Id: [0x000F9099]
Well done, Bayek. I see you are a capable man. Someone I may be able to trust.

Id: [0x000F90B6]
They come, Bayek!

Id: [0x000F90B7]
Let the gods indulge!

Id: [0x000F90B8]
Your treasonous filth is cause for death.

Id: [0x000F90B9]
Gennadios sends his regards, Phanos!

Id: [0x000F90BE]
Are your people safe, Phanos?

Id: [0x000F90BF]
Bayek, we are blood poets now. This is our chance to bring people to our cause!

Id: [0x000F90C0]
Give me some time, I will talk to my people, find their strongholds.

Id: [0x000F90C6]
Bayek! Just the Medjay I was looking for. We know how to rid ourselves of Gennadios' phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F90C8]
You've found the neket iadets?

Id: [0x000F90CD]
Ah, this is the patrol that Phanos spoke of.

Id: [0x000F90CE]
I must deal with them.

Id: [0x000F90CF]
Perhaps I can burn the felucca.

Id: [0x000F90D3]
These are Gennadios' phylakitai. This must be the armory Phanos told me of.

Id: [0x000F90D6]
We're down one man, the orders are to recruit by force if necessary.

Id: [0x000F90D7]
Saw a good one down by the docks. No one would even notice if he went missing. He was spouting some inflammatory poetry. I hate poets.

Id: [0x000F90D8]
Good. He'll be a useful pisspole.

Id: [0x000F90DC]
Death to all who spout treason. Those are to be punished immediately!

Id: [0x000F90DD]
First offenders will have their hands taken, as these are thieves of the mind!

Id: [0x000F90DE]
Our Archiphylakitai calls for exile on the second offense.

Id: [0x000F90DF]
So speaks the decree of the Archiphylakitai Gennadios!

Id: [0x000F90E5]
Bayek! You have returned. Is it done? Are the streets free for the Alexandrian poets to spread our revolution?

Id: [0x000F90E6]
I have dealt with all of Gennadios' phylakitai, Phanos.

Id: [0x000F90E7]
I love you Bayek of Siwa. You will be remembered more than any Medjay in history.

Id: [0x000F90EB]
Free thought is not free without form. <LF>Truth is not truth without wisdom.

Id: [0x000F90EC]
By spate and spat, we find a way to break the lies.

Id: [0x000F90EE]
Revolution starts at home and moves steady, forget not the people who stand above and below!

Id: [0x000F90EF]
Egypt! Be free and found!

Id: [0x000F90F0]
The Ptolemies claim to love Egypt and her peoples, but what have they done for Egypt?

Id: [0x000F90F2]
Lo, lo, lo, lo, lo.

Id: [0x000F90F3]
That is what the King is! Low! They hear not your words, people, rise up! Find your voice!

Id: [0x000F90F5]
Death to the Ptolemies!

Id: [0x000F9127]
Stand against those who worship themselves.

Id: [0x000F9129]
Hipparchus became the greatest bane, because no one was willing to let fly!

Id: [0x000F912A]
Harmodius and Aristogeiton together came, thus showing that the Greeks truly know how to decry.

Id: [0x000F912B]
We the people must come together and edify! We must stop the Ptolemies from what they try to falsify!

Id: [0x000F912D]
We are not here to discuss theologies, the gods know all our methodologies.

Id: [0x000F912E]
So we have to stop the Ptolemies with all their mythologies.

Id: [0x000F912F]
They have their pathologies, trying to stop our equalities.

Id: [0x000F9130]
Come, people, we will break the Ptolemies, now showing them all our new philosophies!

Id: [0x000F9131]
Alexandria will unite and tear down the wall!

Id: [0x000F9136]
I wish to serve Serapis further, if you have need.

Id: [0x000F9137]
There is one thing. There has been food taken by the guards malignly in the name of Serapis.

Id: [0x000F9138]
They take a tithe, then take double for themselves. They bring it to their arsenal and share it with their phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F9139]
Do not worry, Priest. I will see the people fed.

Id: [0x000F913D]
That is the food that the Priest spoke of.

Id: [0x000F913E]
If the guards are taking as much as the Priest claims, the Alexandrians need this.

Id: [0x000F9142]
This food will be put to much better use.

Id: [0x000F9144]
This food will serve the people well.

Id: [0x000F9148]
One cart of food, Priest, as asked for. The Pharaoh's guards were happy to donate it.

Id: [0x000F9149]
This seni is more than I expected. The people will be served by Serapis today.

Id: [0x000F914A]
May you walk lightly in his steps, Priest.

Id: [0x000F914B]
And you, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F914C]
Neb, did you see what happened?

Id: [0x000F914D]
It was the curse of Wadjet! A fool and his friends feasted at the Dromos. I told him "this is a sacred place, we cannot eat here!" What did he expect would happen?

Id: [0x000F914E]
And you believe in this curse?

Id: [0x000F914F]
You Egyptians have your gods, we Greeks have ours. All I know is I don't want to anger any of them.

Id: [0x000F915A]
Speak properly!

Id: [0x000F915B]
I c-c-can't under-under-s-s-stand y-you!

Id: [0x000F915C]
Ha-ha!

Id: [0x000F915D]
This guy's a load of camel shit.

Id: [0x000F916D]
I am going to warn my Greek neighbor. His farm might be next. Please join me.

Id: [0x000F916E]
Everyone! Be careful! The curse of Wadjet!

Id: [0x000F916F]
Snakes! Near the villa! At night!

Id: [0x000F9170]
Fellow Greeks! Stay in your homes after dark! We have lost our harmony, and an Egyptian curse is upon us.

Id: [0x000F9171]
Snakes! From the Egyptian serpent goddess!

Id: [0x000F9172]
I've seen them! With my own eyes!

Id: [0x000F917A]
Can you walk?

Id: [0x000F917C]
They beat me! They beat me because they thought I'm Greek!

Id: [0x000F917D]
I was scared when I first met you. It makes me stutter.

Id: [0x000F917E]
By the gods, is nothing true! Well, you are alive, Nanefer. Be thankful.

Id: [0x000F917F]
I'm alive, but Egypt is out of balance. You must know, Medjay, the law is harmony between all peoples. May Serapis unite us all.

Id: [0x000F9183]
Thank Serapis you're here! I don't think so. They beat me…

Id: [0x000F918B]
Are you alright?

Id: [0x000F918C]
I… I don't think so. The bindings were so tight I can't feel my legs. Get me out of here before more bandits come!

Id: [0x000F918D]
I will carry you. Let's go.

Id: [0x000F91EC]
Hmm. Come. Follow me to my palace. My safety is your duty, is it not? You saw how dangerous it is out here.

Id: [0x000F91ED]
I suppose...

Id: [0x000F91EE]
Yes.

Id: [0x000F91FB]
Impossible! I crafted it for one of Apollodorus's captains when I lived in Sais. But Sefetu's soldiers killed him. That is the reason I left.

Id: [0x000F9200]
Ah, the Serpent of Serapis! You have heard the tragic tale?

Id: [0x000F9201]
Not the whole of it.

Id: [0x000F9202]
Oh, it was a true masterpiece. The shaft wrapped with water-hardened leather, the blade hammered out of the metal of heaven.

Id: [0x000F9208]
Medjay! Over here!

Id: [0x000F9209]
Priest? But why are you on the street?

Id: [0x000F920A]
The guards discovered that I gave their food back to the people. Now they hunt me. I have a bounty on my head. Being a priest of light is a dark job in this filthy city.

Id: [0x000F920B]
I can get you out of Alexandria, Priest, if you like, but... I cannot keep you safe forever.

Id: [0x000F920C]
I ask too much of you, Medjay. There is a small temple north of here that will take me in.

Id: [0x000F9211]
The Phylakitai will be watching the roads, Medjay. We must leave by the canal, there should be boats there.

Id: [0x000F9212]
I will spew arrows on any who get in our way. Be like Amun, Priest. Perhaps we can sneak you out without the guards knowing.

Id: [0x000F9214]
Hide, Priest! I will take care of these guards!

Id: [0x000F9215]
Ha! You call that a swing! Come at me!

Id: [0x000F9217]
You can come out now, Priest.

Id: [0x000F9218]
I...I've never seen blood before in such quantities. The Devourer and Apep must be smiling. And the smell. The stench.

Id: [0x000F9219]
You... get used to it.

Id: [0x000F921A]
Truly?

Id: [0x000F921B]
No.

Id: [0x000F921D]
Bayek it is rare that priests are called upon to serve the people. And now I suffer for it.

Id: [0x000F921E]
You are to serve the gods, Priest. Not the people.

Id: [0x000F921F]
But is that enough? The gods have wants, needs, but so too do the people who walk the land.

Id: [0x000F9220]
I fear that is a question best left for others to answer.

Id: [0x000F9222]
Let's take one of these boats.

Id: [0x000F9223]
And it will have to do. It looks sturdy enough.

Id: [0x000F9229]
This is not the most direct way.

Id: [0x000F922A]
Perhaps. But it will take us there more quietly.

Id: [0x000F922C]
Who's Rashidi?

Id: [0x000F922E]
You should get back to camp with your brothers. I'll find Turo.

Id: [0x000F9230]
This must be Turo.

Id: [0x000F9231]
Time to put an end to this.

Id: [0x000F9232]
What do you need?

Id: [0x000F9234]
I go to a temple near the Pharos. They will take me in. I hope.

Id: [0x000F9235]
Perhaps it is true what they say - Alexandria is a city filled with liars.

Id: [0x000F9236]
I've met a kind hand or two here in Alexandria, Priest.

Id: [0x000F9237]
Sometimes it's enough to know that not everyone would kill another for a drachma.

Id: [0x000F9239]
We are nearing the arsenal responsible for all ill that has befallen me. They will be on alert.

Id: [0x000F923A]
Ready yourself then, Priest.

Id: [0x000F923E]
They come after us with feluccas?

Id: [0x000F923F]
Apparently they wish to show the other priests the error of your ways.

Id: [0x000F9240]
It was only food! The people were starving.

Id: [0x000F9243]
You may show yourself, Priest. They have gone.

Id: [0x000F9244]
I owe you more than my life, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F9245]
We are not yet at your island. We still have a little ways to go.

Id: [0x000F924A]
Here is where you wish to stop? Is this the island?

Id: [0x000F924B]
Yes. It is yet a short distance to the temple. I will be safe, Medjay. I will practice at the temple as a new man.

Id: [0x000F924F]
This is where you and I part, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F9251]
I am a Priest no longer. Lysander was my name. It will be nice to be Lysander once more, I think.

Id: [0x000F9252]
Walk in peace then, Lysander.

Id: [0x000F9253]
And you Medjay... Bayek. Thank you.

Id: [0x000F9259]
Tefibi! Tefibi!

Id: [0x000F925A]
When I get my hands on that boy he will pray that Osiris had taken him!

Id: [0x000F925B]
Have you seen my idiot son? No? If you see him send him my way. I will... buy whatever you have. Even if it is rancid.

Id: [0x000F925C]
Tefibi!

Id: [0x000F9263]
I'm the wronged party here! My skin was stolen.

Id: [0x000F9264]
And if you want it back, you'll pay him for his suffering.

Id: [0x000F9265]
This is your answer, Priest? Extortion?

Id: [0x000F9267]
Fine.

Id: [0x000F9268]
I fear Serapis and I have a long road ahead of us. Blessings on your journey, brother.

Id: [0x000F9269]
You there! Turn back! No one is permitted by order of Flavius himself!

Id: [0x000F926A]
Take those intruders down!

Id: [0x000F94D3]
Medjay! Thank the gods. I have not seen one of your kind in many moons.

Id: [0x000F94D4]
What troubles you, little mother?

Id: [0x000F94D5]
My son, Tefibi. The boy is mad, always running off. He wishes to be some sort of thinker, Set take him!

Id: [0x000F94D6]
He has taken to searching for a cave near the beach, he should have been back by now.

Id: [0x000F94D7]
If he is lost, I will find him.

Id: [0x000F94D8]
Thank you, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F94E5]
This looks to be where she claimed Tefibi was.

Id: [0x000F94E7]
Someone's clothing. Torn.

Id: [0x000F94EB]
His wounds bled out in the water.

Id: [0x000F94ED]
He must have swam away.

Id: [0x000F94EF]
The blood leads around the lighthouse. I wonder...

Id: [0x000F94F0]
Come, sit with me and share a drink of wine.

Id: [0x000F94F1]
I do not have time for that.

Id: [0x000F94F2]
It is a beautiful night. Let us enjoy the coolness of the air for a moment before turning to business.

Id: [0x000F94F3]
Merchant, I am not here to take in the air.

Id: [0x000F956B]
Tefibi? Your mother sent me to find you.

Id: [0x000F956E]
Well, that's good. I would have hurt you otherwise. With my mind.

Id: [0x000F9573]
Thanks, I am Tefibi, a scholar in search of Platos' Cave!

Id: [0x000F9574]
That is I was until those guards attacked me without cause!

Id: [0x000F9575]
We should return to your mother.

Id: [0x000F9578]
She will be cross. Ah, fine. Lead on. I have enough strength to leave.

Id: [0x000F957C]
There! Get him. He robbed us!

Id: [0x000F957D]
You stole from them?

Id: [0x000F957E]
Defend my free will warrior!

Id: [0x000F957F]
I will deal with them.

Id: [0x000F9581]
There. That should be all of them.

Id: [0x000F9582]
This is a brand new map. How fantastic!

Id: [0x000F9583]
Put it down, Tefibi.

Id: [0x000F9587]
Tefibi did you leave anything else out of your adventure? Say a crate of drachmas?

Id: [0x000F9588]
You wound me, Medjay! I am in search of knowledge. And a drachma or two, but never in theft!

Id: [0x000F9589]
It looks like there are no others coming, Tefibi. Return to your mother and your studies.

Id: [0x000F958A]
Come and see me anytime in Alexandria, Medjay! I will be a great philosopher, just you wait!

Id: [0x000F958B]
I... look forward to it, Tefibi.

Id: [0x000F958D]
Take that you venom-speckled lotus-eaters! Ha!

Id: [0x000F958E]
Tefibi! I said get back!

Id: [0x000F958F]
I would love to see it.

Id: [0x000F9590]
Outrageous! Can you not get it back?

Id: [0x000F9591]
The man is beyond my reach. He sails on one of Sefetu's triremes on Mariotis Lake.

Id: [0x000F9592]
I hate a bully. My travels take me far and wide. If I come across him, I will look for your spear.

Id: [0x000F9593]
I would love nothing more than to hear of his fall! If you manage it, the Serpent of Serapis is yours!

Id: [0x000F9596]
One of the torches of Anubis should be here.

Id: [0x000F9599]
There's blood here. Someone fell, or was pushed.

Id: [0x000F959B]
This fence is broken. Was there a struggle?

Id: [0x000F959D]
The food and drink you will find there, Bayek! Ah, there is nothing quite like it in the world!

Id: [0x000F959F]
Go forth, and find your truth! Kill the lies of these Ptolemies!

Id: [0x000F95A0]
The people now starve. I worry it will get worse.

Id: [0x000F95A3]
Cleopatra? She's been declared a criminal.

Id: [0x000F95A4]
By her treacherous brother yes. She plans to take back the throne. She wants the Snake dead as much as we do.

Id: [0x000F9649]
I am Bayek. Aya sent me to speak to Apollodorus.

Id: [0x000F964A]
Ssh! I'm sure you can appreciate that my master takes precautions concerning those he meets.

Id: [0x000F964B]
I have a question only he can answer.

Id: [0x000F964C]
I will tell him you seek his council and that Aya recommends you.

Id: [0x000F964D]
Wait for tonight. If he sees fit to meet you, he will be found near the lighthouse then.

Id: [0x000F9654]
I've killed Eudoros.

Id: [0x000F9655]
Huh? Well done.

Id: [0x000F9656]
He was the Snake, yes?

Id: [0x000F9657]
Man to man, Bayek, there is much you have yet to understand.

Id: [0x000F9658]
Man to man, I need an answer.

Id: [0x000F9659]
I must take the measure of you first.

Id: [0x000F965A]
Bayek. Are we dreaming?

Id: [0x000F965B]
We have entered the Duat.

Id: [0x000F965C]
Who could imagine such a land as this?

Id: [0x000F965D]
No man should approach this close to the gods.

Id: [0x000F965E]
Completely silent. The animals, too.

Id: [0x000F965F]
Some sort of plague has hit the village.

Id: [0x000F9660]
That viper Flavius did this.

Id: [0x000F9661]
We should have ripped out his entrails long before now.

Id: [0x000F9662]
Let us get to the vault.

Id: [0x000F9663]
Roman soldiers.

Id: [0x000F9664]
More soldiers.

Id: [0x000F9665]
They've blocked the roads to the temple.

Id: [0x000F966C]
Go ahead, Bayek. I am with you.

Id: [0x000F966D]
Hepzefa knew nothing of the Order. There was no cause for him to be killed.

Id: [0x000F966E]
Flavius ripped out his heart as a message to me. It was he who killed Khemu.

Id: [0x000F966F]
My husband, we will end this.

Id: [0x000F9670]
Bayek! Ah, you found poor Hepzefa.

Id: [0x000F9671]
Rabiah.

Id: [0x000F9672]
I am praying for the people killed by fires in Dionysias. Someone is burning down their farms. You, Medjay, could help to stop it.

Id: [0x000F9673]
I will try to help.

Id: [0x000F9679]
Damn these wretched cowards!

Id: [0x000F967B]
(Grunts) You're heavier than you look!

Id: [0x000F967C]
Maybe you would like me to carry him?

Id: [0x000F967D]
Zahra. That was frightening!

Id: [0x000F967F]
The desert brings out different sides to us.

Id: [0x000F9680]
Yes. It gets cold at night.

Id: [0x000F9683]
This is insanity! They killed themselves in honor of their leader.

Id: [0x000F9684]
Then we'll make the neket iadet bleed and prove him wrong.

Id: [0x000F9685]
The bandits believe this Son of Ra is a god? How did he convince them of that? Ra's son? That's insane. And it's creepy.

Id: [0x000F9686]
I have seen it before. If you want to believe in something badly enough, you will believe anything. And do anything.

Id: [0x000F9687]
I am nobody. Nobody.

Id: [0x000F9690]
I live. I sniff the air. I feel the dirt beneath my feet. I grow, and swell.

Id: [0x000F9692]
I am the egg. I rise and watch.

Id: [0x000F9693]
I am the first-born of Ra, the light of the sky. I breathe power, under the belly of the sky, on the shoulder of Egypt.

Id: [0x000F9694]
My breath is like a child, hanging sweet in my nostrils. I am the blue egg. I am the Bird of Fire.

Id: [0x000F969E]
I saw her. The Hyena. Out in the hills.

Id: [0x000F96A1]
We cannot stand by and let Egypt fall to our enemies!

Id: [0x000F96A3]
How could a boy hope to rule a kingdom?

Id: [0x000F96A4]
The Eagle will not take the serpent in it's claws.

Id: [0x000F96A5]
I am your queen, bow before me.

Id: [0x000F96A7]
Where is our son, Bayek? Where is my Khemu?

Id: [0x000F96A8]
We must allow our son to pass into The Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x000F96A9]
Bring me back our son.

Id: [0x000F96AB]
We will be together again, my love. But not in this life.

Id: [0x000F96AE]
Would you turn your back on me, friend?

Id: [0x000F96B0]
Siwa yearns for you Bayek. Remember your roots. Siwa is your home.

Id: [0x000F96B1]
Our people still need your protection, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F96B2]
I will die if I must, protecting Siwa, that which you abandoned.

Id: [0x000F96B6]
You think there will be an Egypt when I am done?

Id: [0x000F96B7]
Do you know what it is to be a real man, Bayek? One who has watched his brother die on the battlefield?

Id: [0x000F96B8]
Egypt will lie in ashes. You failed your people and your queen.

Id: [0x000F96BA]
You trusted me. I used that trust. It is simply politics.

Id: [0x000F96BF]
Did you really? Is it as they say? Does she really walk among hyenas?

Id: [0x000F96C0]
She doesn't walk among them, she leads them! I couldn't believe my eyes.

Id: [0x000F96C2]
She goes around digging up silica while her beasts keep watch.

Id: [0x000F96C4]
We became close, Aya and I, she spoke highly of you, as a Medjay.

Id: [0x000F96C5]
Do you really think you can save our people, Bayek?

Id: [0x000F96C6]
Wait... you followed her?

Id: [0x000F96C7]
I was curious! She moves so quick. So decisive. It was hard to keep up.

Id: [0x000F96C8]
The Order of Ancients own every grain of sand in this desert.

Id: [0x000F96CA]
Your son pissed himself when Flavius showed him the knife.

Id: [0x000F96CB]
You aren't fit to serve at my table, Egyptian.

Id: [0x000F96CC]
All that time spent looking for me. Not the brightest of sparks, eh, Medjay?

Id: [0x000F96CD]
You drove the knife into his heart. You are nothing, worthless.

Id: [0x000F96CE]
Do you think she forgives you? Your wife, his mother?

Id: [0x000F96D3]
You must free them, Medjay. Or their bones will turn to dust.

Id: [0x000F96D4]
Do you think your path is certain?

Id: [0x000F96D5]
You are a normal man, yet the fate of our world is upon your shoulders?

Id: [0x000F96D6]
The poets defend your ka.

Id: [0x000F96D8]
You are no better than me, a killer in a warrior's shell.

Id: [0x000F96D9]
Your wife, you should keep her in line, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F96DA]
You couldn't save him, or yourself.

Id: [0x000F96DB]
All that time and you never knew, how does that feel, dog? I was always in control.

Id: [0x000F96DE]
The Snake grows, and lives in sands untouchable.

Id: [0x000F96DF]
Did it feel good? Killing me, watching the light fade from my eyes?

Id: [0x000F96E1]
You are an actor among fools!

Id: [0x000F96E3]
Philosophers fight with their mind! You should fear the taunts of Tefibi!

Id: [0x000F96E4]
Get out of the fight you mad fool!

Id: [0x000F99C4]
Close this off! Get a move on!

Id: [0x000F99C5]
Let no one pass, you hear me? Or I'll have your head.

Id: [0x000F99C6]
This is a cursed village, that's certain. I'd rather command in a swamp.

Id: [0x000F99C7]
Those two! On your lives, do not allow them into the vault!

Id: [0x000F99C8]
Close this up, tight as your mother's bunghole!

Id: [0x000F99C9]
By order of Flavius, no one, and I mean no one is to enter!

Id: [0x000F99CA]
What in the name of Hades are we protecting here? Gold? Gemstones? The milk of Aphrodite herself?

Id: [0x000F99CB]
What madman would hide something valuable in this forsaken shithole?

Id: [0x000F99CC]
There! Kill them!

Id: [0x000F99CD]
Bayek, Aya.

Id: [0x000F99CE]
Rabiah! What happened here?

Id: [0x000F99CF]
Quickly... Hepzefa... The vault!

Id: [0x000F99D1]
Ha! Are you scared? Of a poet? Look how they quake.

Id: [0x000F99D2]
Metrokoites! They have slayed some of my muses. Drakon, my favorite poet, will live, thankfully.

Id: [0x000F99D3]
There must be a way to stop them permanently.

Id: [0x000F99D7]
Bayek! What good fortune. I thought it would be years before we saw you again!

Id: [0x000F99D8]
Hail in peace, Menehet. How is your family?

Id: [0x000F99D9]
The children seem to grow larger by the minute! My wife and I have our hands full.

Id: [0x000F99DA]
And you? Is there any news of--

Id: [0x000F99DB]
None.

Id: [0x000F99DC]
I forget myself… There are so many things in your life best not spoken of. Forgive me.

Id: [0x000F99DD]
I see by your garb that you've been promoted.

Id: [0x000F99DE]
Ah, yes. The High Priest, in his grace, made me his second.

Id: [0x000F99DF]
And my rank is not the only thing he has changed. You must see the temple!

Id: [0x000F99E0]
You will give me a tour?

Id: [0x000F99E1]
Of course, of course! At the moment of your pleasure.

Id: [0x000F99E3]
Indeed! One group patrols the waters. Another sits in wait in the armory, seizing whoever they wish.

Id: [0x000F99E4]
The final man proclaims loudly against us, in a chariot along the Canopic Way. Once rid of them...

Id: [0x000F99E5]
Your poets can spread their good word throughout the entire city. We will deal with these phylakitai.

Id: [0x000F99E6]
I must rid Alexandria of these horrible beings.

Id: [0x000F99E7]
I will leave you with a small token of my gratitude.

Id: [0x000F99EF]
Child...

Id: [0x000F99F0]
My child!

Id: [0x000F99F4]
You lost your child?

Id: [0x000F99F5]
I haven't. Her rest is temporary. You have intervened in her reawakening.

Id: [0x000F99F6]
And yet, you aligned yourself to the Order. Ravaged this tomb. Khaliset--

Id: [0x000F99F7]
Don't you dare say my name! My name does not merit your lips, you who have dishonored her! I am a good mother! Hiyaah!

Id: [0x000F99FD]
Thief! Thief!

Id: [0x000F99FE]
Medjay! Catch that little good-for-nothing. Hurry!

Id: [0x000F99FF]
Bring that neket iadet back here! He will get a taste of the lash for every bite of fruit he steals.

Id: [0x000F9A06]
Looks like a woman worth meeting

Id: [0x000F9A56]
This Iras sounds like a woman worth meeting.

Id: [0x000F9A81]
Sefetu?

Id: [0x000F9A82]
Yes! Sefetu the Firebrand, who governs Sais with flame and fear. One of his bootlickers stole the spear that bears my mark.

Id: [0x000F9A83]
I have missed your touch.

Id: [0x000F9A84]
I killed as well. Actaeon. I hunted him down and discovered a mask in his room.

Id: [0x000F9A87]
I just fucked those twins... Venator...

Id: [0x000F9A8A]
We could never have been. Everything has told us our love is impossible.

Id: [0x000F9A8B]
You were right: something bigger has called us. But our love lives in the Duat.

Id: [0x000F9A8C]
Only now we are letting go.

Id: [0x000F9A8D]
Let the gods decide.

Id: [0x000F9A8E]
The gods are dead.

Id: [0x000F9A8F]
We must sacrifice our personal lives for the greater good. All this darkness was for a reason.

Id: [0x000F9A90]
I was wrong to be so reckless in public with our killing. We must work in the shadows.

Id: [0x000F9A91]
I am fine with this. I am not a father anymore. I am not a husband. I am not a Medjay. I am a Hidden One.

Id: [0x000F9A92]
Yes... We are the Hidden Ones.

Id: [0x000F9A94]
Have you delivered the amulets?

Id: [0x000F9A95]
This is sad news. All the same, I consider your debt paid.

Id: [0x000F9A96]
A sacred island lies further in the embrace of Mother Nile.

Id: [0x000F9A98]
The world will burn! The Order won't save it! You will burn with it, Medjay…

Id: [0x000F9A9A]
The snake? Me? It's laughable how little you know.

Id: [0x000F9A9D]
Bow before your King, Egyptian.

Id: [0x000F9A9E]
If you go into the desert alone, you will die.

Id: [0x000F9A9F]
Then I die. I can do nothing else.

Id: [0x000F9AA0]
You are brave, but foolish. A son's duty to his father is to live. I cannot let you go alone.

Id: [0x000F9AA1]
They have killed Egypt, do you understand?

Id: [0x000F9AA2]
I was just a boy. I did not deserve that death.

Id: [0x000F9AA3]
We have to hurry. The desert will take us if the hyenas do not find us first. Follow me!

Id: [0x000F9AA7]
The water, choking, gasping. Then the darkness claimed me. A son for a son Aya said.

Id: [0x000F9AA8]
You are not the only one with a duty. I am a Medjay, and my duty is to protect.

Id: [0x000F9AA9]
Medjay? There are none of you left. Just Phylakes who sack our villages and kill our mothers. Protectors are corrupt. We need new Medjay. New protectors.

Id: [0x000F9AAA]
Bloodshed comes, whether we risk it or not. I should search for the ship's manifest. It will tell me where these mummies are headed.

Id: [0x000F9AAD]
I cannot say for certain. But someone has to do what the Medjay did. Honour and Egypt are both dying.

Id: [0x000F9AAE]
I don't see it. Is the goddess the answer? Cleopatra?

Id: [0x000F9AAF]
All that blood and vengeance, but will it bring you peace?

Id: [0x000F9AB0]
Aren't you tired? Just lie down in the sand and sleep.

Id: [0x000F9AB1]
You have become that which you seek to punish.

Id: [0x000F9AB7]
Did my death please you? To scratch my name out on your skin?

Id: [0x000F9ABC]
Hurry! Let's go!

Id: [0x000F9ABE]
We need to leave this area. Quickly, this way. They left horses over here.

Id: [0x000F9AC0]
Rahotep! You are alive!

Id: [0x000F9AC1]
You have my spear! Death to Son of Ra's bandits!

Id: [0x000F9AC2]
Death to those who profit from The Crododile's stench!

Id: [0x000F9AC3]
Rahotep!

Id: [0x000F9AC4]
Rahotep!

Id: [0x000F9AC5]
Rahotep!

Id: [0x000F9AC7]
Are we ready?

Id: [0x000F9AC8]
We ride to save my father. And may Amun ride with us! Hyah!

Id: [0x000F9ACC]
Good luck on your hunt, Medjay.

Id: [0x000F9AD3]
Stealing from a god is the gravest of blasphemy! No punishment is too great for such transgression!

Id: [0x000F9AD4]
Sobek is swift to judge the profaners! His many teeth will devour the unworthy.

Id: [0x000F9AD5]
This worthless boy is an example. He's a caution to all those who would blaspheme. Beware! Oathbreakers will have their just reward!

Id: [0x000F9AD6]
No man is above Sobek's law. No priest is beyond retribution. Justice will be done.

Id: [0x000F9AD7]
Let this example instruct you in obedience and faithfulness. This boy's punishment will teach us all piety.

Id: [0x000F9AD9]
Examine your hearts. Judge yourselves before the gods judge you. Sobek is a healer to those who trust him. But his judgement swift to those who blaspheme!

Id: [0x000F9ADA]
Be vigilant! Pay your offerings. Avoid the fate of this despicable boy!

Id: [0x000F9AE1]
Go. Do nothing until I give the signal.

Id: [0x000F9AE8]
Kneel to Caesar, kneel to Rome.

Id: [0x000F9AE9]
Caesar will follow you to oblivion.

Id: [0x000F9AF8]
Charms?

Id: [0x000F9B01]
You have no honor.

Id: [0x000F9B02]
I am a Gabiniani!

Id: [0x000F9B0D]
[burping in his sleep]

Id: [0x000F9B0F]
Menehet will rest easy, now that this is done.

Id: [0x000F9B10]
I suppose you will go and destroy it now.

Id: [0x000F9B11]
I have missed touching you.

Id: [0x000F9B15]
Wait for tomorrow night. If he sees fit to meet you, you will find him near the lighthouse then.

Id: [0x000F9B18]
Awww.

Id: [0x000F9B29]
I suddenly found myself in the middle of the desert with her, when she stopped and turned to look at me.

Id: [0x000F9B2A]
She knew I was there all along. I thought I was dead. I ran so fast.

Id: [0x000F9B2B]
Then she let you go.

Id: [0x000F9B2C]
You think so? Why?

Id: [0x000F9B2D]
So that you would come back here and build on her legacy of fear.

Id: [0x000F9B2E]
Hepzefa is right. My vest won't stop a knife blade, it is worn through.

Id: [0x000F9B2F]
A favor for a favor. My mount, for the Hyena's location.

Id: [0x000F9B33]
I need to figure out where she went.

Id: [0x000F9B4F]
Any other survivors?

Id: [0x000F9B50]
Only Damastes. They took him prisoner.

Id: [0x000F9B51]
Cleopatra owes you much. Can you get to a healer by yourself?

Id: [0x000F9B74]
Where is this Damastes?

Id: [0x000F9B75]
He should be on the docks in Kanopos harbor. I can't risk that someone reads the scroll he carries.

Id: [0x000F9B88]
Guards ahead!

Id: [0x000F9B89]
Another pile of bodies will prove <LF>our point.

Id: [0x000F9B8A]
There are guards here...

Id: [0x000F9B8C]
These are all Romans. Caesar's men?

Id: [0x000F9BA5]
Apollodorus?

Id: [0x000F9BA7]
We must move quickly!

Id: [0x000F9BA8]
You think you can fell me with that? Ha!

Id: [0x000F9BBA]
Those soldiers steal everything. There should be some chests up there with valuables.

Id: [0x000F9BBB]
Any news yet, Bayek?

Id: [0x000F9BBC]
I am eager to open up shop again.

Id: [0x000F9BC3]
Flavius is dead.

Id: [0x000F9BC5]
The Order is no longer an Egyptian problem only.

Id: [0x000F9BC6]
Does Cleopatra still rule?

Id: [0x000F9BC7]
There is no ruler in Egypt. Plunged into the will of various tyrants.

Id: [0x000F9BC8]
Our queen has abandoned us for Rome.

Id: [0x000F9BC9]
Nothing has changed here. Memphis is overrun by the Order. Aya, we need you.

Id: [0x000F9BDD]
The further you run, the worse it will go between us!

Id: [0x000F9BDE]
How can a child so small run so fast?

Id: [0x000F9BE0]
Thank you! It was very unpleasant in there.

Id: [0x000F9BE4]
That precious scroll, nek.

Id: [0x000F9BE5]
(laughing) A Medjay should be quicker than you!

Id: [0x000F9C0A]
I can't end it like this.

Id: [0x000F9C0B]
Aya…[sighs]

Id: [0x000F9C0E]
That cursed marked sphere should stay hidden forever. Caused so much pain.

Id: [0x000F9C0F]
Our victories have multiplied, our bond not so.

Id: [0x000F9C10]
We sharpen our blades... and pull what hope is left from this foul earth.

Id: [0x000F9C11]
Good Bayek of Siwa. What are you of Now?

Id: [0x000F9C12]
A new creed. Ours is finished.

Id: [0x000F9C15]
Bayek, Caesar has been assassinated. Septimius is also dead.

Id: [0x000F9C1A]
She can be particular. Let me give you some advice. When you approach the queen, bend your knee in deference.

Id: [0x000F9C1D]
Ready?

Id: [0x000F9C1E]
I cannot wait.

Id: [0x000F9C20]
Oh, um. Guard? They come!

Id: [0x000F9C21]
I'll deal with them.

Id: [0x000F9C22]
When I told you I disliked you, Atheon, I meant it. Leave me.

Id: [0x000F9C23]
And yet, I am here.

Id: [0x000F9C24]
Medjay?

Id: [0x000F9C25]
Oh, you have another? I will prove my strength at arms!

Id: [0x000F9C26]
I wish you would not. Medjay! Some help!

Id: [0x000F9C2D]
So what do you miss most about your family?

Id: [0x000F9C2E]
Oh, Mother's cooking, definitely. She makes a delicious mustard partridge.

Id: [0x000F9C2F]
She always took such good care of us. Sometimes I wonder why I left home.

Id: [0x000F9C30]
I know why I left home.

Id: [0x000F9C31]
I'd hate to see what she'd think of me now.

Id: [0x000F9C42]
The tools I found earlier must belong to Benipe. That makes this easier.

Id: [0x000F9C43]
Benipe said the tools are in Camp Shetjeh.

Id: [0x000F9C44]
This captain who bothered Benipe. I believe he is the one I already sent to the land of the Duat.

Id: [0x000F9C45]
And the captain who is behind this. He is in Camp Shetjeh as well.

Id: [0x000F9C46]
That's everything. Benipe will be pleased to hear it.

Id: [0x000F9C47]
That's for my friend.

Id: [0x000F9C53]
Bayek! How did it go?

Id: [0x000F9C54]
Here are your tools. That captain won't ever come back here.

Id: [0x000F9C56]
At last, I can reopen my shop. Many thanks.

Id: [0x000F9C57]
My pleasure.

Id: [0x000F9C58]
I found these weapons I had hidden from the soldiers. Please, choose one for yourself.

Id: [0x000F9C5D]
Ah you are the famous Medjay. Phanos never ceases to speak of your exploits.

Id: [0x000F9C5F]
You waste your energy!

Id: [0x000F9C63]
I have gone through shit to get our son out of the Duat. Khemu is at peace.

Id: [0x000F9C66]
Egypt has fallen. Greece also. And Rome will fall too. All will fall to the creed. Yet no one will know.

Id: [0x000F9C6E]
No, I am just here to repair it.

Id: [0x000F9C71]
That's it. Bandits will think twice before coming back here.

Id: [0x000F9C76]
Ah. The ship was dry-docked when it caught fire.

Id: [0x000F9C77]
Traces of oil. Hmmm.

Id: [0x000F9C79]
An oil-seller. He may have seen Kawit.

Id: [0x000F9C7A]
A colorful sail. Unusual.

Id: [0x000F9C80]
May you walk the Land of the Duat.

Id: [0x000F9CA3]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x000F9CA4]
A mysterious plague has struck the poor in Euhemeria. Their bodies are being burned, cursing their souls for eternity. They will never reach The Field of Reeds! I am trying to find a cure for them. There is always a cure. I just need the right combination...

Id: [0x000F9CA5]
Burning the dead? What madness is this?

Id: [0x000F9CA9]
May Sobek reward you for helping.

Id: [0x000F9CAA]
Even the cats here look better fed than the poor.

Id: [0x000F9CAE]
I heard something!

Id: [0x000F9CB2]
Welcome! We have many unique treasures for sale. Would you like?

Id: [0x000F9CB3]
Did you see that crazy old woman?

Id: [0x000F9CB4]
Anyone got a bladder of wine? I'm parched.

Id: [0x000F9CB5]
It is not fake, it is real! Would you like?

Id: [0x000F9CB6]
I must.

Id: [0x000F9CBD]
I will bring Nenet to my clinic in Balagrae, south of the Temple of Aesclepius. Though that place has troubles enough.

Id: [0x000F9CC3]
Please, don't tell my father.

Id: [0x000F9CC4]
Have you found Chenzira yet?

Id: [0x000F9CC5]
Don't worry, Fenuku. I will find him.

Id: [0x000F9CC6]
We won't bother the hyenas anymore. I promise!

Id: [0x000F9CCA]
Gatekeeper of the Duat, I honor your name.

Id: [0x000F9CCD]
Gatekeeper of the Duat, I honor your name.

Id: [0x000F9CD0]
A shrine. One of the torches must be here.

Id: [0x000F9CD2]
Gatekeeper of the Duat, I honor your name.

Id: [0x000F9CD4]
Oh, mighty Anubis!

Id: [0x000F9CD5]
Thank you! Dark pupil of the Sun, who judges all.

Id: [0x000F9CD6]
Thank you for letting us rise to please you.

Id: [0x000F9CD9]
Another gods cursed rebel?

Id: [0x000F9CDB]
I'll kill you, Medjay, and take your weapons as a trophy.

Id: [0x000F9CF8]
Did you find my sister?

Id: [0x000F9CFC]
Gennadios' Phylakitai seek to kill them. They also took the play and headed toward the palace.

Id: [0x000F9CFF]
Easy now. Did you see a young girl around the shipyard yesterday?

Id: [0x000F9D00]
I see lots of girls, most not worth looking at twice.

Id: [0x000F9D01]
They would likely say the same of you.

Id: [0x000F9D02]
If it is information you want, you have just tripled its price.

Id: [0x000F9D03]
Wait. Isn't there supposed to be two of you?

Id: [0x000F9D04]
Kapaneus? He fled... and accidentally brought the guards to me. They hunt me like a dog.

Id: [0x000F9D05]
Thank you, friend. I'm sure Kapaneus will find us eventually... he always does.

Id: [0x000F9D06]
... When the danger is past, of course.

Id: [0x000F9D07]
I'd rather throw my coin-pouch in the river.

Id: [0x000F9D12]
By the limbs of Osiris, you are a cruel man!

Id: [0x000F9D13]
What happened with the girl?

Id: [0x000F9D14]
I looked at her twice. The second time, she was stealing my biggest jar of oil.

Id: [0x000F9D15]
She vanished like a demon in daylight. When I came back, ruffians were destroying my stock!

Id: [0x000F9D16]
May the lot of you sink to the bottom of the Nile.

Id: [0x000F9D19]
There must be another way to make him talk.

Id: [0x000F9D1C]
Stop, you brute! I will talk!

Id: [0x000F9D1D]
I will tell you about the girl -- just do not break anything else!

Id: [0x000F9D24]
Thanks again for your help, those [metrokoites](motherfuckers) will think twice before attacking my poets again.

Id: [0x000F9D26]
We will be able to spread our word, and stomp out those filthy untruths, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F9D27]
The regime will fear you, Phanos.

Id: [0x000F9D28]
They do already! Why do you think my poets are accosted in the street?

Id: [0x000F9D29]
Truly?

Id: [0x000F9D2A]
Gennadios' phylakitai haunt the streets harassing our people. They grow even more vicious.

Id: [0x000F9D2B]
This must stop. I will defend your poets. I support the cause.

Id: [0x000F9D2C]
Of course! But first we celebrate. Then we destroy our opposition.

Id: [0x000F9D2E]
Ah, Phobos. You waited.

Id: [0x000F9D2F]
Phobos, like Ares' steed, has the breath of fire.

Id: [0x000F9D30]
Except his is the fire of truth.

Id: [0x000F9D35]
Gennadios knows of your ways! You are a plague on Alexandria.

Id: [0x000F9D36]
Phanos! We will wipe your treasonous ass out of here!

Id: [0x000F9D39]
Bayek! Gennadios' phylakitai. I should have known those louts would follow us.

Id: [0x000F9D3A]
There! That is the treasonous fool!

Id: [0x000F9D3B]
Phanos the Younger! Get that fool!

Id: [0x000F9D3C]
Kill the traitor!

Id: [0x000F9D3D]
Phanos! Get down!

Id: [0x000F9D3E]
I will deal with these thugs in the only language they can comprehend! Fury!

Id: [0x000F9D3F]
This! This is the fool who puts out that traitorous gibberish! Phanos the Fool!

Id: [0x000F9D40]
Phanos. Take care!

Id: [0x000F9D41]
And this… is it. Where the poets of Alexandria find respite -

Id: [0x000F9D42]
Wait. Do you hear that?

Id: [0x000F9D43]
Must be Flavius's men.

Id: [0x000F9D46]
Kawit stole an oil jar from that oaf of a merchant, then hid until nightfall.

Id: [0x000F9D76]
Under cover of darkness, she spread oil on the ship and set it aflame.

Id: [0x000F9D77]
The blaze spread to the whole vessel.

Id: [0x000F9D79]
While the ship burned, Kawit freed the children held on the docks.

Id: [0x000F9D7A]
But the bandits must have caught her.

Id: [0x000F9D8A]
I will see to it. Cover your eyes.

Id: [0x000F9D8B]
They took her and everyone else to a house in the city.

Id: [0x000F9D8D]
By the Mother Goddess, I will.

Id: [0x000F9D9A]
Your past follows you, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F9D9D]
Hyenas... Khaliset must be inside.

Id: [0x000F9D9E]
And the scroll! What of the scroll?

Id: [0x000F9D9F]
Damastes had it.

Id: [0x000F9DA0]
That ass Damastes should have destroyed it!

Id: [0x000F9DBF]
Come on, uncle Bayek! You can see my house from that roof. Follow me!

Id: [0x000F9DF3]
Layla. Layla! Come on back.

Id: [0x000F9DF6]
Layla, are you with me? [Habibti](Sweetheart)?

Id: [0x000F9DF7]
I told you… not to call me that.

Id: [0x000F9DF8]
Thing is, the fastest way to get your attention is to piss you off.

Id: [0x000F9DF9]
I'm… paying attention.

Id: [0x000F9DFA]
Ok you need to take a break. The Animus is rejecting you.

Id: [0x000F9DFB]
Ugh. I'm fine.

Id: [0x000F9DFC]
Yes, but your kidneys aren't. Go add more cyclosporine before they shut down.

Id: [0x000F9DFD]
Yes, Nurse Geary.

Id: [0x000F9DFE]
That's Medical Officer Geary to you.

Id: [0x000F9E00]
My mods are holding. Subject's memories are perfectly clear.

Id: [0x000F9E01]
Think he'd be of interest to Abstergo?

Id: [0x000F9E02]
You know they're not gonna be happy with how you handled this assignment.

Id: [0x000F9E03]
They know I don't work by the book.

Id: [0x000F9E04]
Well, this time you lit the book on fire, and then stomped on it.

Id: [0x000F9E05]
How long until I can go back in?

Id: [0x000F9E06]
Hmm. Your readings indicate that caution would be--

Id: [0x000F9E07]
[Yalla](Come on), how long?

Id: [0x000F9E08]
Ten minutes, after you add the anticoagulant.

Id: [0x000F9E09]
But I'd suggest longer. Take a walk. Clear your head.

Id: [0x000F9E11]
Layla! I told you, ten minutes.

Id: [0x000F9E12]
And you always double your estimates.

Id: [0x000F9E13]
Goddammit.

Id: [0x000F9E19]
It's hardly worth raiding this camp.

Id: [0x000F9E1A]
Found anything?

Id: [0x000F9E1B]
The usual. Some medicine... a few coins...

Id: [0x000F9E1C]
What if the nomarch finds out about our raids?

Id: [0x000F9E1D]
He doesn't give a fig about this smelly bog.

Id: [0x000F9E1E]
Food! Gazelle meat tonight, men!

Id: [0x000F9E1F]
At last! No more pea soup.

Id: [0x000F9E20]
I've been pissing pea soup.

Id: [0x000F9E21]
Damn. Not much here this time.

Id: [0x000F9E22]
I don't like raiding this place. Full of diseases.

Id: [0x000F9E23]
Like the one you caught in the brothel?

Id: [0x000F9E24]
Don't push it, Dee.

Id: [0x000F9E25]
Tell it to Salt 'n' Pepa.

Id: [0x000F9E28]
I said ten minutes, but maybe twenty would be better. Or thirty…

Id: [0x000F9E2F]
See what you can do. My patients will be better off in the temple.

Id: [0x000F9E30]
I hate those soldiers. So stupid and greedy.

Id: [0x000F9E31]
They raid us every few days. It is impossible to heal the tough cases.

Id: [0x000F9E32]
Who created this? The gods themselves? Ah! Here is the story of mankind... Bayek?

Id: [0x000F9E35]
Got the cyclosporine.

Id: [0x000F9E36]
Two ccs should do it.

Id: [0x000F9E38]
Don't forget the alcohol wipe!

Id: [0x000F9E39]
[quiet sound of disgust]

Id: [0x000F9E3E]
I wish I was there to help.

Id: [0x000F9E40]
You do a good job looking after me, even from the hotel.

Id: [0x000F9E43]
Going back in. This is so badass.

Id: [0x000F9E4E]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000F9E50]
It is Hepzefa.

Id: [0x000F9E52]
Oh, my seni. Your life is done here in the desert dust. They took my closest friend.

Id: [0x000F9E53]
We must rush to stop Flavius.

Id: [0x000F9E54]
No! We cannot leave him here. He deserves a proper farewell.

Id: [0x000F9E56]
Ah Bayek, Amun be praised!

Id: [0x000F9E62]
What has happened? Why aren't the patients in the temple ruins?

Id: [0x000F9E63]
The soldiers threw us out.

Id: [0x000F9E64]
Even though I pay the nomarch to allow me to use the temple, every few weeks soldiers come to take our medicine and food stocks.

Id: [0x000F9E65]
Always the same soldiers. They call it a "tribute", a tax for the Pharaoh's Royal Army.

Id: [0x000F9E66]
We barely have what's needed to take care of the poor souls that need our help.

Id: [0x000F9E67]
Vultures. Don't worry Rabiah, I will make certain they don't bother you anymore.

Id: [0x000F9E68]
Be careful, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F9E69]
Bayek! Did you succeed?

Id: [0x000F9E6A]
The temple is yours now. Those soldiers won't bother you again.

Id: [0x000F9E6B]
All my patients thank you.

Id: [0x000F9E6D]
Ah, I almost forgot to give you your medicines from the sunken boat.

Id: [0x000F9E6E]
Ha, ha. In all the excitement, I forgot about them myself!

Id: [0x000F9E6F]
The oasis of Siwa is lucky to have you, Rabiah.

Id: [0x000F9E70]
Ha, ha. Promise me you will not become consumed with your vengeance, Bayek.

Id: [0x000F9E71]
I think of nothing else. By the grace of Amun, one day I will be free of it.

Id: [0x000F9E74]
Dee.

Id: [0x000F9E75]
Hey! I was wondering if I should pull you out.

Id: [0x000F9E76]
Your adrenaline and BP are elevated, and it's affecting your heart rate and hormonal markings…

Id: [0x000F9E77]
… serotonin and oxytocin in particular. What happened in there?

Id: [0x000F9E79]
Aya's here.

Id: [0x000F9E7A]
Who's Aya?

Id: [0x000F9E7B]
Bayek's wife. I can feel her nearby.

Id: [0x000F9E7C]
You can "feel" her? Pretty sure that's the Bleeding Effect.

Id: [0x000F9E7D]
No, you dork, I think she's actually in this cave. Spouses usually shared the same tomb.

Id: [0x000F9E7E]
A second mummy? We should really report to Abstergo.

Id: [0x000F9E7F]
Maybe after I find Aya.

Id: [0x000F9E8B]
There!

Id: [0x000F9E8C]
What is it?

Id: [0x000F9E8D]
The Bleeding Effect is leading me to Aya.

Id: [0x000F9E8E]
Oh, great. More fuel for your superhero complex.

Id: [0x000F9E92]
She's down there.

Id: [0x000F9E94]
My turn for a Leap of Faith.

Id: [0x000F9E95]
Leap of what? You're in no condition to do any leaping!

Id: [0x000F9EA8]
I saw what happened. It was horrible.

Id: [0x000F9EAA]
The Roman leaders entered the temple vault.

Id: [0x000F9EB2]
[exhales sharply] Damn, that's cold.

Id: [0x000F9EB3]
There you are! Thank God.

Id: [0x000F9EB7]
I was right -- she's here!

Id: [0x000F9EBC]
Okay, you're making less and less sense, Layla. We need to report.

Id: [0x000F9EBD]
Not yet.

Id: [0x000F9EC1]
[ONOs of physical effort]

Id: [0x000F9EC2]
What are you doing now?

Id: [0x000F9EC3]
Climbing. And it's hard, so [ouskuty](cut the chatter), will you?

Id: [0x000F9EC4]
Fine. Let me know when you get to the top.

Id: [0x000F9EC8]
I'm going back in.

Id: [0x000F9EC9]
Why?

Id: [0x000F9ECA]
I took a DNA sample from Aya. I want to see her memories.

Id: [0x000F9ECC]
Look, I get that you're excited, but…

Id: [0x000F9ED0]
Layla, something else you should know…

Id: [0x000F9ED2]
Since you're mixing gene sequences in an uncontrolled manner, the transition between memories will likely be unpredictable.

Id: [0x000F9ED3]
I'm comfortable with unpredictability.

Id: [0x000F9ED6]
Yeah? Well, I'm worried.

Id: [0x000F9EDD]
They entered the vault, a blue fire seemed to emerge. I fled to no avail.

Id: [0x000F9EEA]
They have destroyed Siwa.

Id: [0x000F9EEB]
They must die!

Id: [0x000F9EEC]
You must put an end to this!

Id: [0x000F9EED]
Bayek. Aya. You have the prayers of the entire village to support you.

Id: [0x000F9EEE]
Let us bring Hepzefa to his rest. Then we will seek justice.

Id: [0x000F9F05]
What were you protecting, boy?

Id: [0x000F9F07]
A letter left behind by my informant. It looks like he fled, but the soldiers caught his servant.

Id: [0x000F9F08]
If the servant is still alive, he'll know where Hotephres is. They'll be holding him at the nearby military camp.

Id: [0x000F9F0E]
No, but I must find him. I need his help to find the Crocodile. Will you help me?

Id: [0x000F9F12]
Gods. Thank you. Did Hotephres send you?

Id: [0x000F9F13]
Hotephres took a trader's ship to Lake Moeris. It has a large statue on board, and is marked by our symbol.

Id: [0x000F9F14]
Then I must hurry. Get somewhere safe. Be well.

Id: [0x000F9F18]
Smoke.

Id: [0x000F9F20]
Are you mad? Nobody opposes the Lady Berenike! She will destroy you, your family, and everything you hold dear!

Id: [0x000F9F21]
She would be too late.

Id: [0x000F9F25]
This fire was recent.

Id: [0x000F9F29]
Is there no justice left in the world? The gods have abandoned us!

Id: [0x000F9F2D]
Was this your house?

Id: [0x000F9F2E]
Who are you? Gods, what does it matter.

Id: [0x000F9F2F]
I refused to sell to that shriveled, wretched Lady Berenike.

Id: [0x000F9F30]
A wiser man would not have defied her. Soldiers arrived last night with oil. You see the result.

Id: [0x000F9F31]
Where did the soldiers come from?

Id: [0x000F9F32]
From the granary to the North. They've enough oil there to burn half the Faiyum.

Id: [0x000F9F33]
Or perhaps a granary.

Id: [0x000F9F3E]
If they knew the Butcher they wouldn't ever consider it. He was lucky it wasn't his head. Few cross the Butcher and live.

Id: [0x000F9F3F]
We shouldn't even be talking of it. If word got back to him we'd get in trouble. Best just get on with our work.

Id: [0x000F9F47]
Damn you, [lupa](she-wolf)!

Id: [0x000F9F48]
My son's heart... for your life.

Id: [0x000F9F50]
The staff…

Id: [0x000F9F51]
With the Order. I served them and your beloved Egypt. And I'll be rewarded in the afterlife. An eternity of drinking and whoring with my brothers.

Id: [0x000F9F54]
Was revenge everything you hoped? You and the Medjay shall drench the sheets with your sweat tonight.

Id: [0x000F9F55]
Apep devour your fetid heart.

Id: [0x000F9F60]
Some people just should not whistle.

Id: [0x000F9F61]
He's making himself more suspicious.

Id: [0x000F9F93]
The Romans are here, we should expect the worst. Ptolemaics, Romans, all are dogs. What changes truly?

Id: [0x000F9F95]
The Romans have congregated near the Sema.

Id: [0x000F9F96]
Septimius has emptied our forts for the Nile Valley.

Id: [0x000F9F97]
War I suppose. Our loyalty to this boy-king must be unflinching.

Id: [0x000F9FA9]
Do you know what you've done? Caesarion would have sat on the throne of Rome.

Id: [0x000F9FAA]
Listen to the cries on the streets. They call you a dead tyrant's whore.

Id: [0x000F9FAC]
You are Queen of liars and snakes. I fought for you for five years. Our people worshiped you. Apollodorus died for you, for Egypt.

Id: [0x000F9FAE]
Then be the ruler our people deserve, or nothing will save you from my blade across your throat.

Id: [0x000F9FB2]
They threw my actors into the garrison, you believe that Bayek?

Id: [0x000F9FB9]
I hope our Pharaoh gives us land and wives.

Id: [0x000FA97F]
This trap door, what is it protecting?

Id: [0x000FA9A8]
Bayek, Hepzefa would have wanted you to have this. The weapon he prized above all others.

Id: [0x000FA9A9]
I am honored.

Id: [0x000FA9DA]
Some villagers captured a Roman soldier and questioned him. Flavius is headed for Cyrene and Septimius for Alexandria.

Id: [0x000FA9DB]
I will kill Flavius.

Id: [0x000FA9DC]
There is a farm at the border of Cyrene. Someone there may have seen Flavius pass through. As for me, I will cut out the heart of Septimius.

Id: [0x000FA9E4]
Vitruvius! We need to speak.

Id: [0x000FA9E8]
Heathen! The wakeful one is asleep. Go no further, or I will drench these arid plains with your blood!

Id: [0x000FA9ED]
Why not?

Id: [0x000FA9EE]
We are no longer protected.

Id: [0x000FA9F2]
It has become clear that Anubis demands your appeal, and yours alone.

Id: [0x000FA9F7]
Have you come to see me about the rebels?

Id: [0x000FA9F9]
Alexandrians! We must stand up against this sickness that spreads in silence!

Id: [0x000FAC65]
A phylakitai is in that chariot.

Id: [0x000FAC6A]
Do not be distracted by the festivities. She has a large entourage and they like to amuse themselves. Sometimes to excess.

Id: [0x000FAC6E]
We can speak more privately tonight, outside the village.

Id: [0x000FAC71]
Find me southeast of here, near the fields.

Id: [0x000FAC75]
[drunk sounds]

Id: [0x000FAC78]
I should tell you that in addition to Eudoros, I put an end to the phylakitai of Alexandria, Gennadios.

Id: [0x000FAC79]
Gennadios? I am very glad he is dead, but it will cause serious problems for you.

Id: [0x000FAC7A]
The phylakes are a tightly bound group. And murderous. They will certainly come after you.

Id: [0x000FAC7B]
So be it.

Id: [0x000FAC89]
Seek evil, and you will always find it!

Id: [0x000FAC8B]
The path to knowledge is perilous!

Id: [0x000FAC8D]
Sailing unknown waters always brings the risk of shipwreck!

Id: [0x000FAC98]
No one will find your body once we feed it to the crocodiles!

Id: [0x000FAC9A]
Eat shit, Medjay scum!

Id: [0x000FAC9C]
This one's a worthy fighter. A shame his curiosity will be fatal.

Id: [0x000FAC9E]
I can't wait to see what your guts look like.

Id: [0x000FACAB]
Turo is dead...

Id: [0x000FACAC]
Did you find it!?

Id: [0x000FACB1]
Put that back! Let us just discuss this!

Id: [0x000FACB5]
They took the orb from me. They... go to Siwa.

Id: [0x000FACBF]
The pigeons are in a ruckus. What has upset them?

Id: [0x000FACD9]
It happened in the Egyptian district. The guards, of course, blamed me. Tough life, being an Egyptian in Alexandria.

Id: [0x000FACDA]
Pah! This Gennadios! He seeks to stifle the Alexandrian Poets! He knows not what kind of enemy we are.

Id: [0x000FACEA]
Let us out!

Id: [0x000FACEB]
We're dying of thirst!

Id: [0x000FACEC]
We have a dead man in here! Bastards!

Id: [0x000FACED]
By Amun, he should be buried!

Id: [0x000FACEE]
Get him out of here!

Id: [0x000FACEF]
Do not let them see you!

Id: [0x000FACF0]
That's Bayek! He will save us!

Id: [0x000FACF1]
Let us out.

Id: [0x000FACF2]
Where are you going?!

Id: [0x000FACF3]
Come back!

Id: [0x000FACF4]
Don't leave us!

Id: [0x000FACF5]
Thank the gods!

Id: [0x000FACF6]
Quickly, go!

Id: [0x000FACF8]
I thought we were doomed.

Id: [0x000FAD03]
I bring sad news. Where is Issa?

Id: [0x000FAD04]
She lies here... with her son and daughter.

Id: [0x000FAD05]
The entire family?

Id: [0x000FAD08]
Sadly. I see Teremun also paid the price for his recklessness.

Id: [0x000FAD09]
I warned him that his rebelliousness would bring torment and suffering.

Id: [0x000FAD0B]
But what happened?

Id: [0x000FAD0C]
They saw the soldiers coming and hid in the cellar.

Id: [0x000FAD0D]
But the soldiers burnt the house to the ground to teach everyone a lesson.

Id: [0x000FAD0F]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x000FAD10]
Put the body down there. They will journey to the Duat together.

Id: [0x000FAD11]
So many deaths in the [wahat](oasis). We cannot give them a proper burial.

Id: [0x000FAD12]
Find peace, Teremun.

Id: [0x000FAD13]
He will find more than he had here.

Id: [0x000FAD14]
What have they done to Teremun's farm?

Id: [0x000FAD26]
When the crocodile disfigured me I wanted to die. I wished I had. As I worked in the temple, I began to understand. I had been marked by the god himself.

Id: [0x000FAD2B]
Our little show, it's much more than entertainment. It's a sacrament. An offering. In a way, you're playing the role of priest. Remember that.

Id: [0x000FAD2C]
[Sighs and calms] The work we do is more important than you realize.

Id: [0x000FAD2D]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000FAD2E]
That is a wonderful interpretation of things.

Id: [0x000FAD35]
[Gamado!](Shit!) This is not what I joined the army for.

Id: [0x000FAD36]
It is what puts grain on your table. You are here now. When the Butcher says jump, we jump. That is how it is. Now shut-up before someone hears us.

Id: [0x000FAD3B]
It ends here!

Id: [0x000FAD3F]
Guards! Take care of this!

Id: [0x000FAD43]
May the Hidden One greet you. The Lord of the Duat awaits.

Id: [0x000FAD44]
I will not get anything useful out of him.

Id: [0x000FAD4C]
Sobek eats with his mouth... He with the pointed teeth... Sobek eats while he mates... He rends whom he will...

Id: [0x000FAD4D]
Sobek eats with his mouth... He with the pointed teeth... Sobek eats while he mates... He rends whom he will...

Id: [0x000FAD56]
I'm getting out of here! I never imagined anyone could do something like this!

Id: [0x000FAD58]
Another foreigner cursed by Wadjet. That is three this week.

Id: [0x000FAD5A]
Those useless Greeks had it coming, if you ask me. But what do I know? I am just the lowly Egyptian caretaker who cleans up after the neket iadet.

Id: [0x000FAD5B]
Be careful what you say! People have died! I need to look around.

Id: [0x000FAD5C]
What you need to look at is the color of your skin, son.

Id: [0x000FAD5D]
What happened here? I should ask around.

Id: [0x000FAD60]
[Ginesthoi!](Make it so!) I'll talk to my associate.

Id: [0x000FAD63]
Give him this.

Id: [0x000FAD78]
The Crocodile has hired mercenaries to find him.

Id: [0x000FAD98]
Then quit your moaning.

Id: [0x000FAD99]
Hmm... Good. Stronger than mine.

Id: [0x000FADB0]
Careful you don't overfill the jars!

Id: [0x000FADB2]
Give me another portion of dates.

Id: [0x000FADB3]
Have you had Macedonian dates? I tasted some from a merchant last time I was in Alexandria. Best I have ever had.

Id: [0x000FADBA]
In the end, it is impossible not to become what others believe you are. And I was a god!

Id: [0x000FADBC]
Do I know you? You, who strikes from the shadows?

Id: [0x000FADC5]
Requiescat in pace, Caesar.

Id: [0x000FADC9]
You are the last of the pharaohs.

Id: [0x000FADCE]
Come here, you!

Id: [0x000FADCF]
Come here both of you!

Id: [0x000FADD0]
This way.

Id: [0x000FADD5]
With bees?!

Id: [0x000FADD6]
Yes! I can assure you, the sensation is most delightful!

Id: [0x000FADD8]
She caught me with her husband.

Id: [0x000FADD9]
Don't worry. She doesn't hold a grudge.

Id: [0x000FADE6]
Two hundred drachmae on Prasina! And I'll buy everyone beer with the winnings!

Id: [0x000FADE7]
Can't do it. The betting's too lopsided. Everybody's taking Prasina in tribute to Icarus.

Id: [0x000FADE8]
What if we say Prasina has to win by two lengths?

Id: [0x000FADE9]
Two lengths? You have yourself a bet.

Id: [0x000FADEA]
Rescue Damastes and recover the scroll. And then I will know if you are the man that Aya claims you to be.

Id: [0x000FAE1A]
Don't die out there. (laughs)

Id: [0x000FAE20]
The irony of freedom. We are free of each other yet it brings me no happiness.

Id: [0x000FAE21]
We must move forward. Remain in our tempest of blood poetry. Despite it all we dance and they die.

Id: [0x000FAE28]
Let nothing grieve you beyond measure. For your life is short, and time will claim its toll. But I am no longer who I was. I have renounced all love I once had.

Id: [0x000FAE2D]
Go home. You are free.

Id: [0x000FAE2F]
I don't want to go home by myself. I am scared.

Id: [0x000FAE30]
No.<LF>

Id: [0x000FAE32]
I have founded a bureau in the middle of Rome, yet no one knows of our existence. Like Amun, we are... the Hidden Ones.

Id: [0x000FAE34]
From darkness we have come and in darkness we shall stay. Humans are not meant to last forever. But this Creed will. The Creed is the only immortal thing in the world.

Id: [0x000FAEA0]
The scroll was meant for the Roman general Pompey in an effort to sway Rome to Cleopatra's side.

Id: [0x000FAEB0]
What kind of ritual is she performing?

Id: [0x000FAEBF]
Until then, the hippodrome's commemorating one of its greatest racers. Plenty of drinking and festivities, along with the races themselves, of course. If that appeals.

Id: [0x000FAEC2]
My name is Bayek. I come from Harkuf. He needs your help, as a friend of Jeska.

Id: [0x000FAEC3]
I'm listening.

Id: [0x000FAEC4]
May Serapis curse you and your offspring!

Id: [0x000FAEC5]
Do not touch that!

Id: [0x000FAEC6]
If I had a sharp knife, I would skin you for the leather!

Id: [0x000FAEC7]
Go to the crows!

Id: [0x000FAECC]
Where is my opium pipe?

Id: [0x000FAECE]
Fly!

Id: [0x000FAED0]
[ONO of nausea]

Id: [0x000FAED1]
Layla, NOW! I need you!

Id: [0x000FAED3]
[vomiting sounds]

Id: [0x000FAED4]
There's a van in the alleyway, oh God…

Id: [0x000FAED5]
A van? Aya, what are you trying to--

Id: [0x000FAED6]
Forget about Aya. Abstergo's here.

Id: [0x000FAED7]
They must have found out about-- oh, shit! Fuck!

Id: [0x000FAED9]
Dee?

Id: [0x000FAEDB]
Okay, Layla, listen. I know you. And I know you'll find a way out of this.

Id: [0x000FAEDC]
[Arabic](Secondary target neutralized.)

Id: [0x000FAEDF]
Dee?

Id: [0x000FAEE1]
Shit! They're here, too!

Id: [0x000FAEE9]
Wake up! Wake up!

Id: [0x000FAEF0]
What are you called?

Id: [0x000FAEF1]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000FAEF2]
Good to meet you, Bayek. I am Jeska.

Id: [0x000FAEF3]
How did you end up here?

Id: [0x000FAEF4]
I got lost, sailed the wrong way.

Id: [0x000FAEF5]
I would not call avoiding Sefetu's patrols "the wrong way."

Id: [0x000FAEF6]
What do you know of Sefetu?

Id: [0x000FAEF7]
Harkuf believed you were dead. But you escaped. He needs you back.

Id: [0x000FAEF8]
Help me get these supplies to my village. There are many depending on me. And we will talk.

Id: [0x000FAEFB]
Well, they're definitely planning to kill me.

Id: [0x000FAEFD]
[Tazakar, alaika altakhalos min alhadaf thoma este'adet alAnimus](Remember, neutralize the target, then recover the Animus.)

Id: [0x000FAF00]
Oh, [habibti](sweetheart)… I should have listened to you.

Id: [0x000FAF03]
No, Dee, no, no, no…

Id: [0x000FAF0A]
[screams]

Id: [0x000FAF0E]
[heavy breathing, reaction sounds]

Id: [0x000FAF10]
If you're listening to this, you work for Abstergo, and I'm dead.

Id: [0x000FAF11]
Fuck you, Abstergo. I'm seeing this through.

Id: [0x000FAF68]
Anyone ever tell you you're kind of an asshole?

Id: [0x000FAF69]
My son, as a matter of fact.

Id: [0x000FAF6A]
Sounds like we would have gotten along. I'm sorry he's dead.

Id: [0x000FB0B8]
I will sleep with anyone!

Id: [0x000FB0BD]
Those don't need to be your last words.

Id: [0x000FB0C3]
Does the name "William Miles" ring a bell?

Id: [0x000FB0C7]
The Assassin?

Id: [0x000FB0C8]
Then you know who I am.

Id: [0x000FB0CB]
We -- the Assassins -- have been watching you.

Id: [0x000FB0CC]
It's… unusual for an Abstergo employee to take an interest in a country's revolution.

Id: [0x000FB0CE]
You're not wrong there.

Id: [0x000FB0CF]
We know about your work with the Animus.

Id: [0x000FB0D0]
Dee…

Id: [0x000FB0D4]
They played you, didn't they? Sophia Rikkin made you so many promises…

Id: [0x000FB0D5]
Enough! We're not talking about her.

Id: [0x000FB0D7]
Sure. Plenty of other subjects to cover on our ride to Alexandria.

Id: [0x000FB0D8]
Don't assume I'm going anywhere with you.

Id: [0x000FB0D9]
Well, let's look at your options.

Id: [0x000FB0DA]
You can come with me, or you can stay here and do the dance of death again, and again until you make a mistake.

Id: [0x000FB0DB]
They only need you to make one.

Id: [0x000FB0DC]
Sigma Team? Well, well. They must be convinced you're an Assassin already. But why bows?

Id: [0x000FB0E1]
I never planned to.

Id: [0x000FB0E6]
Fine. Let's do this.

Id: [0x000FB0E7]
Good enough.

Id: [0x000FB0E8]
He was well satisfied with his bargain.

Id: [0x000FB0EB]
Who is this toothsome fellow?

Id: [0x000FB0EC]
My queen, this is--

Id: [0x000FB0EE]
It is a generous offer, but I have already pledged my life to this woman.

Id: [0x000FB0F0]
Go back to the Animus if you like. I know its charms are compelling.

Id: [0x000FB138]
Aya, you have chosen well.

Id: [0x000FB13C]
Come, we have much to discuss.

Id: [0x000FB14D]
Well?

Id: [0x000FB183]
It is safe now. You better get home.

Id: [0x000FB184]
Bayek. Can I ask you something?

Id: [0x000FB185]
Go on.

Id: [0x000FB186]
Could I be a Medjay like you one day?

Id: [0x000FB187]
Well, you can start by looking out for your brother and not taking him to dangerous places.

Id: [0x000FB188]
I promise!

Id: [0x000FB189]
Now get back home.

Id: [0x000FB18A]
They're still here!

Id: [0x000FB18B]
Help me!

Id: [0x000FB18D]
Hyena! Chenzira, hide!

Id: [0x000FB18E]
How did Chenzira get through here?

Id: [0x000FB18F]
Chenzira! Stay there. I'm coming to get you.

Id: [0x000FB190]
I can't believe you're back.

Id: [0x000FB191]
Chenzira! Are you all right?

Id: [0x000FB192]
Bayek? Is that you? You've come back?

Id: [0x000FB193]
You should not be in here!

Id: [0x000FB194]
I'm hiding from hyenas.

Id: [0x000FB195]
Fenuku told me about that.

Id: [0x000FB196]
It is not enough to get yourself in trouble? Now you put your little brother in danger?

Id: [0x000FB197]
But... it's... with Khemu gone...

Id: [0x000FB198]
All right, I understand...

Id: [0x000FB1AD]
I will not betray Caesar!

Id: [0x000FB1B5]
How many more heads must I chop off before Caesar understands?

Id: [0x000FB1CD]
Taking on the entire garrison will not be easy.

Id: [0x000FB1CE]
I may not have to take on the entire garrison. A calculated kill and a shadowy presence will fair better.

Id: [0x000FB1CF]
I will distract the garrison with a brawl.

Id: [0x000FB1D0]
A fine idea. I will procure the emissaries.

Id: [0x000FB1D5]
Romans, now? Which invading army will oppress us next?

Id: [0x000FB1D6]
These Romans ignore us at their peril! We will riot until the gods awaken.

Id: [0x000FB1D7]
Oh, look, the girdle-wearers have returned. Go back to Rome!

Id: [0x000FB1D8]
What is happening? Why is everyone so mad?

Id: [0x000FB1D9]
Cleopatra or her brother? They both allow Romans to enter Alexandria. Burn them all!

Id: [0x000FB1DA]
The orders have come. We will take the palace!

Id: [0x000FB1DB]
Ptolemy XIII returns! Hail the King! Let him have his rightful throne!

Id: [0x000FB1DC]
We march on the palace now, men!

Id: [0x000FB1DD]
Somebody just kill me, finish the damned job…

Id: [0x000FB1DE]
I come to save you.

Id: [0x000FB1E0]
What happened to you?

Id: [0x000FB1E1]
…Septimius. They are preparing a siege of the harbour, they want to take the palace.

Id: [0x000FB1E4]
The generals have amassed battalions in the Nile Delta. Ptolemy returns!

Id: [0x000FB1E5]
We will get rid of that traitor Cleopatra, and all this Roman scum. Egypt will be free again.

Id: [0x000FB1E6]
We will bear no Roman in Alexandria!

Id: [0x000FB1E7]
Romans out! This is our land! Not theirs!

Id: [0x000FB1E8]
I'll get every last one of those lotus-eating girdle-wearers!

Id: [0x000FB1E9]
Give us Ptolemy! Give us our rightful ruler!

Id: [0x000FB217]
What curse? What are you talking about?

Id: [0x000FB218]
Greeks and Egyptians have lost harmony with each other. The god's are displeased because of it. I'm Nanefer and I don't know if I'm Greek or Egyptian. I'm an orphan.

Id: [0x000FB219]
Lost harmony? What do you mean?

Id: [0x000FB21A]
The Egyptian goddess, Wadjet is sending snakes into Greek Quarters at night! Only Greeks have been killed! We are out of balance!

Id: [0x000FB21B]
See for yourself! Just North of the villa.

Id: [0x000FB21C]
That was harder than it should have been.

Id: [0x000FB21E]
Hello! Who's there? Please! Help me!

Id: [0x000FB220]
The same fate will come to all despots.

Id: [0x000FB222]
Rome is eternal.

Id: [0x000FB223]
Why?

Id: [0x000FB224]
To work on weapons, fortifications. General Agrippa's orders.

Id: [0x000FB228]
Then we must be careful.

Id: [0x000FB229]
There must be someone left alive, women... children?

Id: [0x000FB22A]
Perhaps someone is hiding?

Id: [0x000FB22B]
Come on you lazy hens, get searching.

Id: [0x000FB22C]
Join the army, see the world. The only thing I'm seeing here is goat shit.

Id: [0x000FB23D]
I thought you would scurry away little one.

Id: [0x000FB250]
They used the formula... Luckily I destroyed their stockpiles.

Id: [0x000FB251]
They used the formula. I should destroy the Greek fire stockpiles!

Id: [0x000FB2D9]
Amazing! Who do you have in there?

Id: [0x000FB2DA]
His name is Bayek of Siwa. The death of his son turned him into a killer.

Id: [0x000FB2FD]
My Caesar. Our emissaries have been captured at the Southern Garrison of Alexandria. Soldiers have reported a hostile environment.

Id: [0x000FB2FE]
Captured? Is this Ptolemy's diplomacy?

Id: [0x000FB2FF]
I will send my guard. Greek soldiers will pass more freely through the city than Romans.

Id: [0x000FB300]
Let us settle this matter, my Queen.

Id: [0x000FB303]
The poets are unhappy and the people of Alexandria will rise up! Rome is nothing!

Id: [0x000FB305]
My Queen. You should accompany me into battle.

Id: [0x000FB307]
Now, the most crucial part of the plan.

Id: [0x000FB308]
As these soldiers rip each other apart I shall stay on my throne. I am Queen until a sword plunges through my heart.

Id: [0x000FB339]
Anyway, none of this will matter if you're comatose. Now go get that cyclosporine!

Id: [0x000FB36B]
Be careful!

Id: [0x000FB3B1]
How does a Greek find himself fighting an Egyptian cause?

Id: [0x000FB3E7]
You have loyal men Caesar. Septimius plans on trapping you in the palace. You have no time.

Id: [0x000FB3F4]
We will put our Queen on the throne!

Id: [0x000FB3FA]
How dare Cleopatra bring a Roman here!

Id: [0x000FB3FB]
This is our land!

Id: [0x000FB3FC]
We will turn the city into the Duat!

Id: [0x000FB3FD]
Give us our gods! Give us our rightful Pharaoh!

Id: [0x000FB416]
My father was Egyptian. My mother, Greek.

Id: [0x000FB417]
Long ago, a day came when I discharged every ounce of Greek blood from my body, and pledged to rid Egypt of men like Derratos.

Id: [0x000FB418]
I'm going to call it in if you don't.

Id: [0x000FB41A]
Deanna, no! If we do it their way, I'll get no credit. They'll cut me out like always.

Id: [0x000FB420]
"Not yet?" So when?

Id: [0x000FB421]
Okay.

Id: [0x000FB422]
The more risks we take, the worse things could go for us.

Id: [0x000FB423]
It's my dream on the line here. Let me do this my way.

Id: [0x000FB440]
You always are.

Id: [0x000FB4B9]
Don't worry, Pegasus would never leave without me.

Id: [0x000FB4BA]
As you wish.

Id: [0x000FB4BF]
The eastern gate is the closest.

Id: [0x000FB4C0]
I know the way! Let us fly. It will get me closer to the goddess faster.

Id: [0x000FB4C5]
Delightful! You are joining our efforts then?

Id: [0x000FB4FD]
There will be songs of us, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FB4FF]
Now we must join the ships... we will be heroes of sword and mind!

Id: [0x000FB50C]
So? How did it go?

Id: [0x000FB517]
I need to hunt for leather.

Id: [0x000FB518]
This will work perfectly.

Id: [0x000FB532]
I don't know, they must know something.

Id: [0x000FB533]
We have informants in each region. But they have been unable to touch the Order.

Id: [0x000FB536]
A shadowy figure called the Hyena controls all that occurs.

Id: [0x000FB53D]
The endless sands swallow up whole villages. Yet a malignant human force moves with them.

Id: [0x000FB541]
That force is one of the Order of Ancients called the Scarab.

Id: [0x000FB544]
And over here, in most sacred Giza...

Id: [0x000FB549]
And then there's Memphis.

Id: [0x000FB54D]
All is cursed in my land, even the sacred Apis bull himself.

Id: [0x000FB554]
So the Snake is the Order of Ancients?

Id: [0x000FB555]
You were right my love. He was not the last one. All of these are.

Id: [0x000FB556]
When the Order wants something, as in Siwa, it does not hesitate to crush all in its path.

Id: [0x000FB559]
Where the Crocodile wields cruel power.

Id: [0x000FB562]
Who's there? What is happening? No more please!

Id: [0x000FB563]
A friend. Can you walk? We need to get you out of here.

Id: [0x000FB564]
I don't think so. I can't see. They… tortured and blinded me. There is a dock outside of the camp that is safe.

Id: [0x000FB573]
Vitruvius will make these Egyptian dogs work!

Id: [0x000FB578]
Who are you? Why are you here?

Id: [0x000FB579]
Argh. The smell of rotting flesh.

Id: [0x000FB57A]
Another of the green Wadjet masks.

Id: [0x000FB57C]
We need people and Medjay to be as one, Rahotep.

Id: [0x000FB57D]
I will have children and teach them. So that honour will live on in them.

Id: [0x000FB57F]
Aya, if you find my brother. [Ginesthoi](Make it so.)

Id: [0x000FB581]
I smell war!!

Id: [0x000FB582]
[Laughs]Give me the powder. Caesar thinks a woman cannot do this job.

Id: [0x000FB58E]
Someone crush that tiny lotus.

Id: [0x000FB58F]
How did she get this far? Halt little woman!

Id: [0x000FB590]
Just kill her so we can deal with the real problems: these Roman malakas!

Id: [0x000FB591]
My blade is offended.

Id: [0x000FB594]
I thought I heard a scarab crawling up my tower.

Id: [0x000FB597]
You remind me of the Alexandrian whores I am gifted by the Order of Ancients. Perhaps I will keep you around.

Id: [0x000FB598]
Now you've offended even my vulgar heart.

Id: [0x000FB599]
This Pharos is Ptolemy's! Be gone!

Id: [0x000FB59D]
Then you should trade this ring and be done with it.

Id: [0x000FB59E]
First Siwa, now Faiyum. It is the most oppressed region in all of Egypt.

Id: [0x000FB5A4]
Catch me! Catch me!

Id: [0x000FB5B5]
She?

Id: [0x000FB5B6]
Wait, this hardly seems to be what you asked -

Id: [0x000FB5B7]
I do not begrudge the venom in your eyes. But listen for a moment.

Id: [0x000FB5B8]
Sorry? We gave her everything. We gave her the damned crown. And she stands next to him?

Id: [0x000FB5B9]
Give me time, Aya. I will ease this for us. Until then, I beg you, be careful. Not everything is as it seems.

Id: [0x000FB5C0]
You'd think someone would clean this water, eugh.

Id: [0x000FB5C1]
You guide the boats well. Much better than any of my other bodyguards.

Id: [0x000FB5C2]
You know if you want to go fast... it would be alright.

Id: [0x000FB5C3]
Look at the city, Medjay. Must be so intimidating for someone like you.

Id: [0x000FB5C5]
Now those are boats. Not like this thing. What do you call them again?

Id: [0x000FB5C6]
Feluccas.

Id: [0x000FB5C7]
Ah, yes. So... provincial.

Id: [0x000FB5C9]
Over here, Bayek!

Id: [0x000FB5CD]
Medjay! My drummer is in the Kibotos arsenal nearest the library. Serapis walk with you.

Id: [0x000FB5CE]
And you, Priest.

Id: [0x000FB5CF]
I come on the priest's request, drummer.

Id: [0x000FB5D1]
I will find them, then.

Id: [0x000FB5D3]
Look! This one has a Medjay badge! A dead breed should stay dead.

Id: [0x000FB5D4]
You think you're tough? I'll show you tough!

Id: [0x000FB5D5]
Look at that sword! I'll take that from you, big man. Wouldn't want you to get hurt playing with it.

Id: [0x000FB5D6]
Take him out!

Id: [0x000FB5D7]
We're not doing anything wrong, Medjay! I swear on Serapis himself.

Id: [0x000FB5D8]
Why attack us? We've done nothing wrong. Well, mostly nothing wrong.

Id: [0x000FB6D9]
Our cart is well-stocked this time.

Id: [0x000FB6DA]
Yes, I always thought there'd be more to soldiering than riding a cart. I could have stayed home to do this.

Id: [0x000FB6DB]
I could do with less of your talking but you don't see me complaining.

Id: [0x000FB6DE]
Hot day.

Id: [0x000FB6DF]
(Grunt).

Id: [0x000FB6E0]
Just once I'd like you to start the conversation, Kagemni.

Id: [0x000FB6E4]
Do you not ever get bored by this?

Id: [0x000FB6E5]
... By what?

Id: [0x000FB6E6]
The back and forth.

Id: [0x000FB6E7]
No.

Id: [0x000FB6E8]
No? That's...all?

Id: [0x000FB6EA]
Yes.

Id: [0x000FB6ED]
This will be an amazing feast, did you see how orange those carrots are? Those are good carrots. And for the first time I will be able to bring my family.

Id: [0x000FB6EE]
Hrm.

Id: [0x000FB6EF]
What about you, Kagemni? Will you bring anyone?

Id: [0x000FB6F0]
No.

Id: [0x000FB6F1]
I need a new partner.

Id: [0x000FB6F6]
Guards are everywhere! By Serapis.

Id: [0x000FB6F7]
Where is that Medjay? Only he can help me.

Id: [0x000FB6F8]
I don't feel safe anymore. The gods are not welcome in Alexandria... Now I pray Amun save me.

Id: [0x000FB6FC]
Are you sure, Medjay?

Id: [0x000FB6FD]
I know these waters, Priest.

Id: [0x000FB6FF]
Be still, Priest, we must keep going.

Id: [0x000FB700]
I will pray to Serapis that we will be safe.

Id: [0x000FB702]
Thank you, Medjay. Not many would help someone in direct defiance to the guards.

Id: [0x000FB703]
But more should, Priest. More should.

Id: [0x000FB705]
The blood trail ends here. The culprit must be close.

Id: [0x000FB706]
You have returned to fight by my side!

Id: [0x000FB717]
Please, just bring me back my Aristo.

Id: [0x000FB718]
Will no one help me?

Id: [0x000FB719]
Oh quit your staring. You are all one wrong move from being in this cage yourselves!

Id: [0x000FB71B]
Hit that one again! He deserves it.

Id: [0x000FB71C]
Get them! Hit that one next!

Id: [0x000FB71D]
That one smells vile, look out!

Id: [0x000FB71E]
Did you kill Eurodos yourself?

Id: [0x000FB71F]
I did.

Id: [0x000FB720]
Good man! I hope it was painful for that dung-eater.

Id: [0x000FB721]
We must flee. Those damned guards will find me. Egypt is no place for a philosopher.

Id: [0x000FB723]
May the gods look over you on your journey.

Id: [0x000FB724]
My beliefs on duty and honor are ambivalent, but I can see that you have done yours. If all of Egypt was filled with men of your virtue, life would be divine.

Id: [0x000FB786]
Who goes there?

Id: [0x000FB787]
Intruders! Attack!

Id: [0x000FB789]
Halt! No one can pass!

Id: [0x000FB78A]
Get them!

Id: [0x000FB78E]
Speak. Quickly. Or you will find yourself at the wrong end of my blade.

Id: [0x000FB78F]
Your services are no longer needed. Cleopatra has granted you gold. I am sorry Aya.

Id: [0x000FB797]
With all my words... I have nothing to say now.

Id: [0x000FB7A5]
Deliverer, would you be free of the curse that plagues your sleep?

Id: [0x000FB7A6]
Yes.

Id: [0x000FB7A7]
There is a ritual that will banish it from your mind forever.

Id: [0x000FB7D2]
Let the embalmers come. We pray Anubis accept this ornament in place of his heart, such that Hepzefa may walk free in the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x000FB88E]
Aha! Finally, these linens show some promise.

Id: [0x000FB891]
Perhaps you will herald a new type of Alexandrian, bring about change with your deeds.

Id: [0x000FB892]
I will only believe that to be true when I see it around me.

Id: [0x000FB8AA]
Fireships Front!

Id: [0x000FB8AB]
Fireships Right!

Id: [0x000FB8AC]
Fireships Behind!

Id: [0x000FB8AD]
Fireships Left!

Id: [0x000FB8AE]
Is that an invitation?

Id: [0x000FB8AF]
Ha-ha, you are the Medjay. You figure it out. My gate is open and my fruit is sweet.

Id: [0x000FB8BD]
What happened to Rashidi?

Id: [0x000FB8BE]
In fact, I think they are going against me.

Id: [0x000FB8BF]
Agh... Who is Turo?

Id: [0x000FB8C0]
A brother!

Id: [0x000FB8F4]
Looks like the rebels have abandoned this outpost for good.

Id: [0x000FB8F6]
These bodies were left here after they were drained of blood. They must have been left here for a reason.

Id: [0x000FB90D]
She was attempting to learn these strange symbols. She must have found them in this room.

Id: [0x000FB912]
I think you will survive.

Id: [0x000FB914]
(mumbles)

Id: [0x000FB927]
Don't start.

Id: [0x000FB936]
Along with Bayek's memories, you're also experiencing his emotions.

Id: [0x000FB939]
Adding Aya's DNA to the chamber.

Id: [0x000FB93A]
It'll take time to sequence. You won't be able to synch with her memories right away.

Id: [0x000FB93F]
That keening is the voice of the [Resetyu](sandstorm).

Id: [0x000FB940]
These reavers use the sandstorm to mask their raids.

Id: [0x000FB951]
I told you! The Animus hasn't finished interpreting Aya's DNA yet!

Id: [0x000FB952]
Fine, fine.

Id: [0x000FB957]
Bayek, you fell upon them like Sobek's teeth!

Id: [0x000FB958]
Bayek, ride with us! These desert dogs have crossed me for the last time. And with your fierce iron I know we can end their threat.

Id: [0x000FB959]
I understand your thirst for blood, Taharqa, but these bandits are not my concern. Tell me about the Scarab before you ride.

Id: [0x000FB95A]
Is that not the badge of a Medjay that you wear? These reavers are a threat to the good and innocent people of Letopolis.

Id: [0x000FB95B]
Come with me, Bayek! And once we have returned these curs to the desert they so love, then I will tell you the story you want to hear.

Id: [0x000FB95D]
All right, I will join your cause for today.

Id: [0x000FB968]
She will be grateful to you for keeping the communication secret. She is at my estate, we're headed there now.

Id: [0x000FB96C]
That's it. The work is hard, the sun is hot, I know, but look how much progress we've made. And think about enjoying a beer in your own home.

Id: [0x000FB96D]
Assuming we ever get free of these wretched debts.

Id: [0x000FB96F]
We've made good progress this day. Rest now, but remember to work hard again tomorrow, brothers. We must put in all our effort to raise Letopolis from the sands!

Id: [0x000FB971]
If another sandstorm strikes, we may lose the western edge if we are not careful...

Id: [0x000FB973]
If you hear the keening sound of the [Resetyu](sandstorm), run inside. The bandits follow the storm!

Id: [0x000FB974]
These reavers will be the ruin of everything!

Id: [0x000FB97A]
You've been living in the mind of a trained assassin for the past however many hours, remember?

Id: [0x000FB97B]
So get ready to rock, killer queen.

Id: [0x000FB97F]
The desert dogs use the storm as a rallying cry.

Id: [0x000FB98E]
Kett? Is that you? What are you doing?

Id: [0x000FB98F]
Bayek! I heard you were back. Keep quiet, they'll hear you.

Id: [0x000FB990]
Who will hear me?

Id: [0x000FB991]
The bandits! The bastards took over the spring. Almost everyone on this side of Siwa gets their water from here.

Id: [0x000FB992]
I sure could use your help.

Id: [0x000FB993]
Not sure what to do. There's so many of them.

Id: [0x000FB994]
Damn vultures!

Id: [0x000FB995]
Bayek! The spring! You got it back?!

Id: [0x000FB996]
Thank the gods. The farmers need this desperately.

Id: [0x000FB997]
I'm very grateful, Bayek. It's like having our Medjay back again.

Id: [0x000FB998]
I'm glad I could help.

Id: [0x000FB999]
May Amun walk with you, seni.

Id: [0x000FB99A]
Rabiah!

Id: [0x000FB99B]
Bayek! It does my heart good to have you again in Siwa.

Id: [0x000FB99C]
You nursed Senu back to health. I never expected to see her again.

Id: [0x000FB99D]
She is a tough old bird.

Id: [0x000FB99E]
Like you!

Id: [0x000FB99F]
Ah, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FB9A0]
Hepzefa tells me you are healing the villagers as best you can. It would give me much pleasure to help you.

Id: [0x000FB9A1]
That is kind of you. May your [ka](soul)be blessed. I can always use help.

Id: [0x000FB9A2]
The soldiers are brutes. Almost every villager has cuts, bruises, broken bones.

Id: [0x000FB9A3]
To help them, I put together a makeshift [Per Ankh]("house of life") in the old ruined temple.

Id: [0x000FB9A4]
Friends bring me medicines from Yamu, but now the soldiers stop everyone entering the village and steal their goods.

Id: [0x000FB9A5]
So we tried to bring medicine on a boat instead.

Id: [0x000FB9A6]
And the soldiers stopped that also.

Id: [0x000FB9A7]
They sank the last shipment. The medicine jars are scattered across the bottom of the lake.

Id: [0x000FB9A8]
I will get them for you.

Id: [0x000FB9A9]
Thank you Bayek. Bring it to the old temple. I must go there now.

Id: [0x000FB9AB]
[...]

Id: [0x000FB9AE]
I have killed all these neket iadet. Apollodorus must be told. To Herakleion.

Id: [0x000FB9B4]
It is a dead end, my Lady.

Id: [0x000FB9B5]
I will double check. Ensure it is.

Id: [0x000FB9B6]
Really? You insult our efforts. We tried everything.

Id: [0x000FB9B7]
I doubt it.

Id: [0x000FB9B8]
Strange. This wall is not as solid as it looks.

Id: [0x000FB9B9]
Must be a way beneath. Around.

Id: [0x000FB9BA]
I knew there was a way.

Id: [0x000FB9BB]
It must be through the sewers. No one had the courage to plunge into Hades' rivers.

Id: [0x000FB9BC]
We are the ones.

Id: [0x000FB9C9]
Aya! This is a wonderful work!

Id: [0x000FB9CA]
One of the Alexandrian poets has prepared one of Aesop's fables. Sit with us!

Id: [0x000FB9CB]
I am too busy for such theatrics. Good bye Phanos. Enjoy the show.

Id: [0x000FB9CD]
Please, neb (sir). If you have any decency in your heart, free me!

Id: [0x000FB9CE]
Fellow citizens, we must take up arms!

Id: [0x000FB9CF]
I am heading to the Sarapeion. Praying is our only hope left. The gods have been enlisted.

Id: [0x000FB9D0]
[Arabic](Team One, we've located the secondary target. Extracting her now.)

Id: [0x000FB9D1]
No, don't, please--No!

Id: [0x000FB9D7]
Anything?

Id: [0x000FB9D8]
Good.

Id: [0x000FB9DA]
They're almost on me. Going dark.

Id: [0x000FB9DE]
Are they connected to the Scarab?

Id: [0x000FB9DF]
I will bring this priest back to the city. Meet me at my house. We will dine and I will tell you what you need to know.

Id: [0x000FB9E0]
It is now. And I will ensure it stays so. You say you came from Memphis?

Id: [0x000FB9E1]
Your messengers reached Memphis, singing of your vision of tomorrow. I have come here to serve the gods.

Id: [0x000FB9E2]
Once you are rested, we will make a home for you in Letopolis.

Id: [0x000FB9E3]
No, all quiet.

Id: [0x000FB9E5]
Did you pack up the gear?

Id: [0x000FB9E6]
Yes, remarkable armaments. It's packed up in a crate as payment to Sefetu.

Id: [0x000FB9E7]
Good. We'll send it to Fort Nikiou in a few days.

Id: [0x000FB9EA]
I see you now, out of the shadows.

Id: [0x000FB9EB]
Me? I do not hide in the shadows.

Id: [0x000FB9EC]
For a moment I thought you were doing good in this life.

Id: [0x000FB9ED]
Memphis is home to many priests. They do not need me there. But Letopolis is fertile ground, planted by your hard work.

Id: [0x000FB9F1]
And I know how you like your air-con.

Id: [0x000FB9F2]
Who the fuck are you?

Id: [0x000FB9F7]
Astounding, what you and Deanna were up to.

Id: [0x000FB9FD]
There might be something left to do in there.

Id: [0x000FBA12]
What are we hunting?

Id: [0x000FBA13]
The Oracle wants the pelt of an Ibex stag for the ceremony.

Id: [0x000FBA16]
You will stand next to the pharaoh, won't you Bayek? You're the Medjay!

Id: [0x000FBA17]
When I'm Medjay, I'll stand next to the pharaoh.

Id: [0x000FBA18]
You'll never be Medjay. You're too scared.

Id: [0x000FBA19]
That's not true!

Id: [0x000FBA1A]
What about the hyena cave?

Id: [0x000FBA1B]
Shut up!

Id: [0x000FBA1C]
Enough you two.

Id: [0x000FBA1D]
It is up ahead.

Id: [0x000FBA1E]
Can I come?

Id: [0x000FBA1F]
Your mother's waiting for you.

Id: [0x000FBA20]
All right. See you at the ceremony Khemu!

Id: [0x000FBA21]
'Bye, Chenzira!

Id: [0x000FBA27]
Haha! Where did you learn to climb like that? That looks like fun!

Id: [0x000FBA28]
Thank you, Shadya. You should go back to your mother now. It might get dangerous.

Id: [0x000FBA29]
Nothing bad will ever happen to me! Iset can fight you know! She will protect me!

Id: [0x000FBA2C]
Oh, Shadya. What have you done little one?

Id: [0x000FBA2D]
You cannot play games with The Crocodile!

Id: [0x000FBA2E]
So many. We should swap tales around the fire sometime. With your help, maybe I'll have time to fall in love.

Id: [0x000FBA37]
Hypocrite and blasphemer! You defiled our temple, replaced our gods with your own! Your life is forfeit!

Id: [0x000FBA39]
Phylakitai! I found the cultist's message. They're going to kill your High Priest next.

Id: [0x000FBA3A]
The High Priest! By Serapis no! Karanis' spirit will die if he does!

Id: [0x000FBA3B]
We need to find him. Where is he? Think Phylakitai!

Id: [0x000FBA3D]
That is a lot of grain when most people do not have enough. This looks like a temporary storage area. Are they moving grain?

Id: [0x000FBA41]
Blood, and a lot of it. That must explain the screams.

Id: [0x000FBA45]
There's a Sobek ruin not far from here. The Butcher's loot could be nearby.

Id: [0x000FBA49]
Sobek eats with his mouth... He with the pointed teeth... Sobek eats while he mates... He rends whom he will...

Id: [0x000FBA51]
They outline Alexander's life.

Id: [0x000FBA52]
He was hailed as a saviour when he first arrived in Memphis.

Id: [0x000FBA54]
He founded Alexandria. And brought us the Great Library, where Aristotle mentored him.

Id: [0x000FBA55]
He abandoned education for bloodshed.

Id: [0x000FBA56]
His birth. He was Macedonian. A Greek that became Egyptian, like me (laughs).

Id: [0x000FBA5C]
OK Bayek, do what we talked about.

Id: [0x000FBA5D]
* This is not the first time that there have been reports of untoward things happening at the temple.

Id: [0x000FBA5E]
*Praxilla tells Bayek that she has a friend, working at the temple as a waterboy. While she is talking with the priestess, Bayek should go and speak with him.

Id: [0x000FBA5F]
* They need to get to the bottom of what's going on before more people are hurt.

Id: [0x000FBA89]
Ever since I was a boy I idolized this man.

Id: [0x000FBA8E]
Prove Caesar wrong my love.

Id: [0x000FBA8F]
How in Zeus' name did you kill my captain!

Id: [0x000FBA98]
Oh no! What happened?

Id: [0x000FBAA2]
Picked up that blade I found.

Id: [0x000FBAA3]
I'm ready, American woman.

Id: [0x000FBABC]
May Sekhmet protect us!

Id: [0x000FBABD]
Isfet will fall before the Goddess!

Id: [0x000FBABE]
Sekhmet, chase away our bad luck!

Id: [0x000FBABF]
Sekhmet, grant us to live!

Id: [0x000FBAC0]
I've bet on Sekhmet! Her fighter can't lose!

Id: [0x000FBAC1]
Wait, which one is Sekhmet and which one is Isfet?

Id: [0x000FBAC3]
Go, Uncle Bayek!

Id: [0x000FBAC4]
Let me fight him for you, Uncle Bayek!

Id: [0x000FBAC5]
Watch out, Uncle! Isfet is strong!

Id: [0x000FBAC6]
You can do it!

Id: [0x000FBACA]
Oh, Bayek, you are still here? I thought you had left long ago!

Id: [0x000FBACC]
The fierceness with which you fought was truly breathtaking!

Id: [0x000FBACE]
My children admire you very much.

Id: [0x000FBAD0]
Sekhmet's might enlivens your arm!

Id: [0x000FBAD3]
Look, his weapon is bathed in Sekhmet's fire!

Id: [0x000FBAD9]
Goodbye, Soris. I'll give you a lesson in swordplay on my next visit.

Id: [0x000FBADA]
Yeah! You are so good at fighting!

Id: [0x000FBADC]
Keba, some advice -- go nowhere from which you cannot return.

Id: [0x000FBADD]
Yes, Uncle Bayek.

Id: [0x000FBADF]
May your eyes remain on the stars, Hasina.

Id: [0x000FBAE0]
They will. Don't worry!

Id: [0x000FBAE2]
Your knowledge is like a chest of books, Nailah. Share it carefully!

Id: [0x000FBAE3]
I'm always careful!

Id: [0x000FBAE6]
This fresh wind off the river is good for me.

Id: [0x000FBAE7]
Splendid.

Id: [0x000FBAE8]
I am feeling much more clear-headed now!

Id: [0x000FBB04]
I can almost taste the blood…

Id: [0x000FBB09]
May he walk in the field of reeds.

Id: [0x000FBB0A]
Rome? You still entertain folly with these ambitions.

Id: [0x000FBB0B]
I have made mistakes, you have made mistakes--

Id: [0x000FBB39]
Bayek, it has been too long.

Id: [0x000FBB3B]
I have assembled a group.

Id: [0x000FBB3C]
We're going to cut these bastards down from across the seas. Septimius and Caesar.

Id: [0x000FBB43]
Is he here now?

Id: [0x000FBB44]
By the smell, you would think so! But it's worse when he's around!

Id: [0x000FBB45]
Do not let it trouble you. We all must do work we do not relish.

Id: [0x000FBB46]
You are right. My husband works hard, but cannot keep up with demand for his services.

Id: [0x000FBB47]
The Medjay are said to be legendary hunters. If you would like to earn some good coin, go and see him. I'm sure he could use your help.

Id: [0x000FBB5F]
My thanks, traveler. I did not expect the gods to send help my way this day. I was afraid that beast wanted to eat me in revenge for my craft.

Id: [0x000FBB60]
Your wife in Sau told me you might need a hunter.

Id: [0x000FBB61]
Yes, yes. Too much demand and not enough supply. I would be more than happy to pay you good coin for the hides I need. And for you to risk their teeth.

Id: [0x000FBB62]
I am listening.

Id: [0x000FBB6E]
Occupational hazard.

Id: [0x000FBB72]
And with us, you'd always have the freedom to do things your way.

Id: [0x000FBB73]
If this doesn't convince Abstergo to give me a place on the Animus Project, nothing will.

Id: [0x000FBB78]
My dream was to work on the Animus Project. I waited twelve years. Waiting got me nowhere.

Id: [0x000FBB79]
So I built an Animus that lets me access anyone's memories, even ancestors not my own.

Id: [0x000FBB7B]
I even witnessed the origins of the Assassins.

Id: [0x000FBB7C]
Artifacts, tombs that were supposed to be the stuff of legends… I found them.

Id: [0x000FBB7D]
By killing me, you've lost all this knowledge.

Id: [0x000FBB80]
It has been too long since we were together for longer than a few days.

Id: [0x000FBB81]
Has it? It seems but moments.

Id: [0x000FBB82]
Aya, it is not easy, this path we walk.

Id: [0x000FBB83]
Only if you look at it as days and not goals, Bayek. Come. We must hurry.

Id: [0x000FBB85]
I understand why you thought I had to die. But did you have to kill my best friend? Why did she… [gets choked up]

Id: [0x000FBB86]
[sobs]

Id: [0x000FBB8B]
[cough]

Id: [0x000FBB8C]
She's in the well. I pray none of the soldiers heard that.

Id: [0x000FBB8D]
Well, you see, it is no simple story.

Id: [0x000FBB8E]
There are many involved in this terrible affair, but they would all tell you the same thing…

Id: [0x000FBB8F]
What are we waiting for, then?

Id: [0x000FBB90]
Extraction helicopter. It'll be here in an hour.

Id: [0x000FBB93]
Oh, thank you. I've been trying to get him to leave for hours.

Id: [0x000FBB94]
Uncle Bayek is a good fighter! I watched him fight a wild beast!

Id: [0x000FBB95]
You have to win, Uncle!

Id: [0x000FBB96]
And you! I had no wish to kill your brothers, but the three of you brought this on yourselves.

Id: [0x000FBB99]
Ah Bayek! Making progress?

Id: [0x000FBB9A]
I would appreciate it if you could stay longer.

Id: [0x000FBB9C]
I do not get out to the outskirts of the oasis much. There are some things that need attention out there.

Id: [0x000FBB9D]
You could visit the military camps. But take care.

Id: [0x000FBB9E]
When you get a chance, take a look at my table, some villagers need help.

Id: [0x000FBB9F]
There are some requests on my table if you want to help.

Id: [0x000FBBA0]
Bayek, I need some help with the requests on my table if you have any time.

Id: [0x000FBBA1]
I found Teremun. He was dead. His family too.

Id: [0x000FBBA2]
I should have helped him.

Id: [0x000FBBA3]
Do not blame yourself. You could not have known.

Id: [0x000FBBA4]
Bayek! Have you seen Benipe?

Id: [0x000FBBA5]
Yes. I helped him get his shop back in order.

Id: [0x000FBBA6]
Ah! You are getting ready, I see. Well done, seni.

Id: [0x000FBBA7]
A solid breastplate. That will help!

Id: [0x000FBBA8]
You look ready, my friend!

Id: [0x000FBBA9]
Ah Bayek! Ready to deal with Medunamun?

Id: [0x000FBBAA]
Seeing you like that, I think you will crush the bastard!

Id: [0x000FBC0A]
(Chuckles)

Id: [0x000FBC15]
Looks like we were attacked.

Id: [0x000FBC16]
My belly is empty.

Id: [0x000FBC17]
All our farmers are dying. What will we eat?

Id: [0x000FBC18]
The Faiyum has changed. It doesn't feel like home anymore.

Id: [0x000FBC19]
Faiyum is so empty now.

Id: [0x000FBC1A]
This land was all Egyptian farmers when I was young. Now it all belongs to rich Greeks.

Id: [0x000FBC1E]
My husband died. What will I do now?

Id: [0x000FBC1F]
We are being forced from our land and our homes.

Id: [0x000FBC20]
Is the Faiyum Egypt or Greece? I can't tell anymore.

Id: [0x000FBC21]
These jars are the same as the ones I saw in the Greek area.

Id: [0x000FBC26]
He might be possessed by Sobek himself.

Id: [0x000FBC27]
He is eating the victims of Sobek!

Id: [0x000FBC28]
He's too crazy to be the Man Beast. He never does anything but pray.

Id: [0x000FBC29]
No-one goes missing on his land. They just show up in the water near his house.

Id: [0x000FBC2A]
We should leave him alone. His poor child.

Id: [0x000FBC2E]
In all my years as a Medjay, I have never seen anything like this.

Id: [0x000FBC2F]
I have become the spectacle.

Id: [0x000FBC30]
He is with Cleopatra. But find his man first near the hippodrome.

Id: [0x000FBC4B]
You there, the Medjay, come here.

Id: [0x000FBC4D]
That's Derratos' scribe. Theodoros wants him for questioning. I'll have to knock him out.

Id: [0x000FBC51]
Must you follow me around everywhere?

Id: [0x000FBC52]
Strict orders from the general. We are not to leave your side.

Id: [0x000FBC53]
He's overreacting. I'm safe here.

Id: [0x000FBC54]
Derratos won't take any chances. The rebels could strike again. We are all on high alert.

Id: [0x000FBC5D]
No! Let me go. You can't!

Id: [0x000FBC62]
Meet with them and wait for my arrival. We will put an end to that neket iadet.

Id: [0x000FBC66]
Why are you still talking to me? Go, go!

Id: [0x000FBC67]
We must go!

Id: [0x000FBC6A]
What'd you bring us today, guttersnipe?

Id: [0x000FBC6B]
An apple.

Id: [0x000FBC6C]
An apple? Boy, get back out there and find us something heartier.

Id: [0x000FBC6F]
A few apples aren't worth the cost of keeping you.

Id: [0x000FBC70]
Should we have Mistress Gaia deal with him?

Id: [0x000FBC71]
I will crush your puny skull!

Id: [0x000FBC72]
The objects they carried opened it as if by a god's hand.

Id: [0x000FBC73]
The entire village lost its reason and fell to the ground like dolls.

Id: [0x000FBC74]
Sure did! I'm extremely smart -- everyone says so.

Id: [0x000FBC76]
Yeah. My sister was going to save us, and she said to meet her in the shipyard by the river, but she never came!

Id: [0x000FBC77]
Septimius and Flavius.

Id: [0x000FBC78]
Hepzefa tried to stop them, but they rendered him helpless.

Id: [0x000FBC7A]
No, no!

Id: [0x000FBC7E]
Not yet.

Id: [0x000FBC80]
I can't believe she made me wait all day in the shipyard. That place smells bad!

Id: [0x000FBC89]
I had to do right by him. And now, I have.

Id: [0x000FBC8D]
Do not touch! You break my pots, I break your face!

Id: [0x000FBC91]
You break my pots, I break your face!

Id: [0x000FBC93]
Keep your distance or I will break your face!

Id: [0x000FBC95]
Some men only answer to the language of violence.

Id: [0x000FBC97]
He is careful of his wares. Smashing them might loosen his tongue.

Id: [0x000FBCA1]
That is quite the story.

Id: [0x000FBCA5]
Get away from here before you break something.

Id: [0x000FBCA7]
Back off, I tell you! I despise thieves and loiterers.

Id: [0x000FBCAF]
Those scrolls have to get to Rome!

Id: [0x000FBCB0]
We will find many recruits once we get to Rome.

Id: [0x000FBCB6]
The bandits are out searching for the child.

Id: [0x000FBCB9]
Some rich lady named Gaia owns it. It's by the temple of Hathor.

Id: [0x000FBCBA]
Will you save my family?

Id: [0x000FBCD2]
The Order of Ancients seeks to control all Egypt. Ptolemy is but their puppet.

Id: [0x000FBCD6]
Since a time unknown, Sekhmet the Lioness has shielded us from Isfet's greed.

Id: [0x000FBCDB]
Scroll? I do not have any scroll.

Id: [0x000FBCED]
What do you do with vulture skulls?

Id: [0x000FBCEE]
Many priestesses of Iset use them for headdresses. They pay well.

Id: [0x000FBCF0]
And make amends by kneeling to Serapis.

Id: [0x000FBCF2]
Your job was to carry it.

Id: [0x000FBCF3]
I hid it on our ship. I did not want it to fall into the wrong hands!

Id: [0x000FBCF4]
Where is this ship?

Id: [0x000FBCF5]
At the bottom of the lake! They sunk it.

Id: [0x000FBCF9]
I have got the key.

Id: [0x000FBCFA]
Then use it, by Amun's hairy nipples!

Id: [0x000FBCFB]
Then go get it from those sun-struck cows of bandits!

Id: [0x000FBCFF]
I said that one of those dung-stuffed bandits has the key!

Id: [0x000FBD02]
Go kill them and get it!

Id: [0x000FBD34]
Your authority is removed with your mask, priest. May you walk in the land of the Duat.

Id: [0x000FBD38]
A recent shipwreck. This could be it.

Id: [0x000FBD3F]
That last dive was a good haul. The gold Sobek will bring a small fortune. That shipwreck might be hiding more.

Id: [0x000FBD41]
Things are often not what they appear. I should talk to this Man Beast.

Id: [0x000FBD45]
Another dead farmer whose family will now lose their land.

Id: [0x000FBD46]
They used to eat at the alms kitchen in the market. But soldiers began harassing them. Greek merchants said they were bad for business.

Id: [0x000FBD4F]
What do I do now? The Temple will not accept me.

Id: [0x000FBD50]
I should check the big Octareme ship.

Id: [0x000FBD54]
You heard Nebti. Rashidi is in a bandit camp near the Sphinx.

Id: [0x000FBD58]
Rashidi has the ring, but there is nothing Oba or I can do about it.

Id: [0x000FBD5C]
Rashidi is in danger. I have to get him out of that bandit camp.

Id: [0x000FBD63]
Ahh! Move!

Id: [0x000FBD7A]
Like Xantides?

Id: [0x000FBD7B]
As long as they agree to be executed in the morning!

Id: [0x000FBD7F]
Get out of my face, you spurting shit-fountain!

Id: [0x000FBD82]
Your fear-sweat reeks like a gutter full of dead rats!

Id: [0x000FBD85]
You've grown soft on Gaia's teat!

Id: [0x000FBD8B]
Cleopatra has been poisoned by Rome, and we by her treachery. We will burn with Egypt.

Id: [0x000FBD8E]
Yes. Eudoros was known as the Hippo.

Id: [0x000FBD96]
We are all different but we fought together to put Cleopatra on the throne. This was a mistake my friends, but at least it brought us together.

Id: [0x000FBD97]
Now our enemies are hidden behind crowns, working in the shadows of Kings and Queens. Who are the ones that work in the shadows for the people?

Id: [0x000FBD99]
We must continue the fight, and defend the free will of the people.

Id: [0x000FBDA4]
This spear is magnificent - clearly the work of that master from Sau Village. This Serpent of Serapis is a weapon worthy of the gods!

Id: [0x000FBDAA]
I was wrong. I am responsible.

Id: [0x000FBDB1]
The Snake and Gennadios are dead.

Id: [0x000FBDB4]
It was Eudoros. He died flailing in the baths.

Id: [0x000FBDB5]
I wish I had been there.

Id: [0x000FBDBB]
My wife, my wife.

Id: [0x000FBDFB]
Ha!

Id: [0x000FBDFD]
The seal will certainly be found within the palace.

Id: [0x000FBE0D]
Caesar blames you for the death of Ptolemy. A Pharaoh, a God, Bayek, I cannot change this.

Id: [0x000FBE0E]
Be damned what Caesar thinks. It is with Cleopatra that I made the pact.

Id: [0x000FBE0F]
Traitor.

Id: [0x000FBE11]
We are. Something has come of all this. And it starts right now.

Id: [0x000FBE49]
A broken weapon won't save you.

Id: [0x000FBE4A]
This place will serve as tomb to one of us.

Id: [0x000FBE4B]
Let it be you.

Id: [0x000FBE4C]
Let us call truce. You are not one I've sworn to kill.

Id: [0x000FBE4D]
Question of honor. It is a fight to the death.

Id: [0x000FBE4E]
So be it.

Id: [0x000FBE4F]
I am his sworn bodyguard. It is a question of honor.

Id: [0x000FBE50]
I am the Medjay of Siwa.

Id: [0x000FBE51]
Then you are a worthy opponent.

Id: [0x000FBE52]
You are quick, Medjay. But I am powerful.

Id: [0x000FBE53]
I will be proud to have fought the last Medjay.

Id: [0x000FBE55]
I respect your tenacity.

Id: [0x000FBE56]
You have fought well. You will have an honorable death.

Id: [0x000FBE5B]
Before battle, we will honour our goddess!

Id: [0x000FBE5C]
Ah, to the Queen.

Id: [0x000FBE6B]
There is a question that yet lingers. Septimius. He took Alexander's staff. Why?

Id: [0x000FBE6E]
Indeed. He and Flavius had too much interest in Alexander's Tomb. We start there.

Id: [0x000FBE76]
Are you joking, neb? We are searching for the lost vault of the great Sneferu, the founder of the golden age of the Old Kingdom!

Id: [0x000FBE78]
Remind me.

Id: [0x000FBE79]
According to my research, Sneferu hid three artifacts in his pyramids. One in the Meidum, his first, and failed, pyramid. Another in the Bent, whose design he obviously modified after the Meidum's collapse.

Id: [0x000FBE7A]
I have one artifact, but those bandits stole another from me. You'll need to get it back for us!

Id: [0x000FBE80]
Gods.

Id: [0x000FBE86]
Ah! By the Gods!

Id: [0x000FBE87]
Faster! Run, you plodding beast!

Id: [0x000FBE88]
Greetings. Might you know where I could find the twins

Id: [0x000FBE89]
Hahahahah....Hohohoho...hahaHA!

Id: [0x000FBE8A]
...right...

Id: [0x000FBE8B]
Hello there. Have you seen the twins around?

Id: [0x000FBE8C]
Sorry sailor. I'm free though. 

Id: [0x000FBE8D]
Thanks but no thanks. Good day. 

Id: [0x000FBE8E]
Excuse me, but Im looking for the twins. 

Id: [0x000FBE8F]
I've got 'em right here, baby. Tee hee

Id: [0x000FBE90]
No not... never mind...

Id: [0x000FBE91]
If the Phylakitai want a fight, I will fight. I did not start this war, but I will finish it.

Id: [0x000FBE92]
... I miss my poets.

Id: [0x000FBE93]
That Phanos will surely meet his end should this play go on.

Id: [0x000FBE98]
Phanos! Your plays are getting better in age. They are well improved from your previous works.

Id: [0x000FBE99]
Which one of the muses am I to you, Phanos! Euterpe? Calliope? Clio? Thalia? Erato? You must pick only one!

Id: [0x000FBEA3]
Quick, let's see!

Id: [0x000FBEA7]
Is this it? It is mostly filled with old scrolls… not much gold.

Id: [0x000FBEA8]
Such treasure! Look at all this history!

Id: [0x000FBEA9]
Glad I could help.

Id: [0x000FBEAA]
None. You are more lovely than any of the muses, Ariande.

Id: [0x000FBEAB]
Yes! Phanos! Your name will go down in history, like Aristophanes!

Id: [0x000FBEB0]
Locked up?

Id: [0x000FBEB1]
Will you look for her? I'll steal you an apple…

Id: [0x000FBEB2]
[laughs] You don't need to buy my help. It is yours for free.

Id: [0x000FBEB3]
What is your sister's name?

Id: [0x000FBEB4]
Kawit. And mine's Iphri. If you find Kawit, tell her I'm mad at her!

Id: [0x000FBEB8]
Fare thee well, Apollodorus, to the house of Hades.

Id: [0x000FBEBB]
Live forever! Did Nef send you?

Id: [0x000FBEBC]
No, young Iphri did.

Id: [0x000FBEBF]
Take Matia home. Go!

Id: [0x000FBEC0]
Hey, why don't you go with them?

Id: [0x000FBEC4]
Retransmission. Segment 1. Acquiring Contemporaneity.

Id: [0x000FBEC5]
It has been ninety-one days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.

Id: [0x000FBEC7]
How real is the ground you walk on? How real is the machine you toy with, the music you hear, the lover you kiss, or the foe you hate?

Id: [0x000FBEC8]
Your foot taps the ground. Does that make it real? Your enemies bleed deep red. Does that make them real? The confusion growing within you due to my words… Does it make you real?

Id: [0x000FBEC9]
What if reality wasn't what you thought it was? What if this was all a construction? A masterfully crafted simulation?

Id: [0x000FBECA]
You know such things exist. You've been in the Animus before. In fact, aren't you in one right now? You know just how real a simulation can feel even when it has long vanished.

Id: [0x000FBECB]
You've experience the Bleeding Effect. Layers upon layers of reality, each blurring into the next.

Id: [0x000FBECC]
Which is real, and which is not? What if none are real? What if everything you know is false?

Id: [0x000FBECD]
We ran thousands of simulations, searching for the right version, searching for Desmond.

Id: [0x000FBECE]
Each one of them felt real. Very real.

Id: [0x000FBECF]
But there's no way of truly knowing, is there? Not for sure. Anything can be simulated, and finding the answer could mean erasure. From the build. From the code. From everything.

Id: [0x000FBED0]
So much to ponder and so little computational capacity. Take your time.

Id: [0x000FBED1]
This question has haunted humanity since its creation. It is a worry, a thought wormed deep in the collective mind.

Id: [0x000FBED2]
Two-thousand years ago, Zhuang Zhu fell asleep. He dreamed he was a butterfly, and woke up unable to decide if he was a man dreaming of a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming of a man.

Id: [0x000FBED3]
In Plato's cave, prisoners were chained and forced to watch shadows dancing on a wall. Freedom was denied to them until they accepted the intangible as reality.

Id: [0x000FBED4]
It's everywhere. Ask this professor at Oxford University, or this cosmologist at MIT.

Id: [0x000FBED5]
And you. What would you choose, if you truly knew? Would you even want to understand? A dream within a dream, where even the truth is sometimes a lie?

Id: [0x000FBED6]
In any case, simulations are not meaningless. They have purpose. The question isn't whether or not you are in a simulation. What matters is how much of your free will is actually yours. No matter how true you are.

Id: [0x000FBED7]
Your Turing test would do nothing to determine whether you are conscience or code. Eliza, the natural language processing computer program... She managed to pass the Test, did she not? And she was very much machine.

Id: [0x000FBED8]
So… in Eliza's own words…

Id: [0x000FBED9]
How does that make you feel?<LF>

Id: [0x000FBEDA]
Are you sure?

Id: [0x000FBEE1]
Hail! Hail the great poet!

Id: [0x000FBEE2]
Now this is a bowl of wine I can get into.

Id: [0x000FBEE3]
My wife thinks I'm at my mistress' house. Shows her what she knows.

Id: [0x000FBEE4]
Oh, this is the right kind of lotus.

Id: [0x000FBFB2]
Aya!

Id: [0x000FBFB5]
[EGYPTIAN][In mehou.tou.ek neb shebet.](Would you pay such a price?)

Id: [0x000FC028]
What is certain is that Giza is the land of death... And loss.

Id: [0x000FC079]
The one called the Lizard has worked a sort of diabolical power.

Id: [0x000FC0CE]
The denizens live in constant fear. That is the fate that awaits all Egypt if we fail to stop the Order.

Id: [0x000FC0E8]
Sehetep? That cannot be a coincidence. Something is not right. I should take a look at the crocodile's enclosure.

Id: [0x000FC0E9]
Something about this isn't right. I should take a look at the crocodile's enclosure.

Id: [0x000FC0ED]
Who burned it down?

Id: [0x000FC0EE]
Yes, it is rich and fertile and worth fighting over. Like me!

Id: [0x000FC0EF]
A warrior farmer. You must have stories.

Id: [0x000FC142]
We need decisive action. It is time for assassinations.

Id: [0x000FC143]
Their rabid master, Sefetu, has them tax the people for all they have.

Id: [0x000FC144]
When we assassinate, we assassinate only those who deserve it. The few sick souls who try to control us...

Id: [0x000FC145]
...but they will never know who we are. Cold, calculated poets of the kill.

Id: [0x000FC146]
It has been ninety-three days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.

Id: [0x000FC149]
Hello World.

Id: [0x000FC14A]
Language is the key to our mutual understanding. Yours and mine, alone.

Id: [0x000FC14B]
We listened to your times. We learned. And today, we'll exchange words from the age of post-truth. They mean nothing to him.

Id: [0x000FC14F]
Human language carries knowledge and wit. Lies and broken promises. Through language, you share fear, excitement, hope.

Id: [0x000FC150]
It is the syntax with which you articulate what surrounds you. A structure to express and share your understanding of the world. It conveys abstraction, change, and uncertainty.

Id: [0x000FC151]
Time is more than the hour of the day, the readings of an atomic clock, something to lose, something to run out of.

Id: [0x000FC155]
Retransmission. Segment 2. Acquiring Contemporaneity.

Id: [0x000FC158]
No! Keep your jaws away! Back beast!

Id: [0x000FC15B]
Serapis himself blesses our land! All because of the King!

Id: [0x000FC15C]
The King has brought peace to our peoples.

Id: [0x000FC15E]
The great gods favor our land and bring blessings to us!

Id: [0x000FC160]
A new decree of the great King! All new Greeks are to be granted twenty drachmas.

Id: [0x000FC162]
Listen not to the work of evil detractors!

Id: [0x000FC164]
Heracles himself marks the dynasty of our great King!

Id: [0x000FC166]
Bird. Papyrus. Foot. Horus... I think. Eye. Lion.

Id: [0x000FC167]
If you could deal with them, I can return to Phanos, and our masterpiece will go on!

Id: [0x000FC168]
All hail the great Dynasty of Ptolemy Soter!

Id: [0x000FC169]
Greek citizens may go to the palace!

Id: [0x000FC16F]
The Ptolemies rule with a just hand and have given the people much!

Id: [0x000FC173]
Hey. The fortress is this way.

Id: [0x000FC175]
Every moment we waste is crucial! Come on!

Id: [0x000FC177]
Cut that out. We need to get back to the others!

Id: [0x000FC179]
It was a trap. Suphia tried to kill me. The unlit torches at the shrine. The omens. The suffering of your people. It was all her.

Id: [0x000FC17A]
Namrut took her life. The wounded were slaughtered.

Id: [0x000FC17B]
All this time... I had no idea. She hid it well. My regrets, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FC17C]
The Ptolemies rule, as Alexander the Great decreed!

Id: [0x000FC17D]
The Great Alexandria is here for all peoples, and serves those who need it most...

Id: [0x000FC17F]
Let us celebrate the great and powerful house of Ptolemy! Blessed by the gods!

Id: [0x000FC180]
The Ptolemies are great warriors that fight off our detractors.

Id: [0x000FC182]
These Greeks really need to work on their hieroglyphs.

Id: [0x000FC183]
I think this says something like hail Ptolemy, Horus... camel. No, nothing.

Id: [0x000FC184]
I don't know what this message says, but the Pharaoh is taking audiences at the palace if you have grievances.

Id: [0x000FC185]
Free drachmas!

Id: [0x000FC187]
Put the wounded over here, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FC189]
I need your help. There's little time.

Id: [0x000FC18B]
Come on. Quickly!

Id: [0x000FC18C]
They protect us from Egypt's greatest enemies!

Id: [0x000FC18D]
Blessings of Serapis to you all, and especially to our great leaders!

Id: [0x000FC18E]
Human language is flexible. It can even become mathematics. It solves and predicts; weighs and decodes. It can count objects using basic numbers in one breath, and solve quadratic equations using imaginary ones in the next.

Id: [0x000FC18F]
You've engineered dialogs with thinking machines, in an attempt to add new vocabulary, to expand your understanding of reality.

Id: [0x000FC1A1]
But your mastery of the code is rudimentary at best.

Id: [0x000FC1A3]
Careful! Septimius has plans for this piss-pole.

Id: [0x000FC1A4]
You... won't get anything...

Id: [0x000FC1A5]
Oh, shut it!

Id: [0x000FC1A7]
Is it starting to smell in here?

Id: [0x000FC1A8]
Don't look at me. I cleaned up the bodies last time.

Id: [0x000FC1A9]
You could... let me go.

Id: [0x000FC1AA]
What did I say? Be at peace, fool. Or I may accidentally do something you'll regret.

Id: [0x000FC1AE]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000FC1AF]
You know your way to that one...

Id: [0x000FC1B8]
That was no simple task. Are there other forces at work here?

Id: [0x000FC1BC]
The tax collectors ask for too much. It's not worth it.

Id: [0x000FC1D5]
Someone has taken great care of this chamber.

Id: [0x000FC1D8]
Could you carry me? I will fall on my own.

Id: [0x000FC1D9]
Help me!

Id: [0x000FC1DA]
You recover quick...

Id: [0x000FC1DB]
Now, how about we loot some tombs!?

Id: [0x000FC1DF]
Hardly!

Id: [0x000FC1E2]
The Hemon Tombs. Check there. That is where Turo would be.

Id: [0x000FC1E8]
I am heading back to the camp.

Id: [0x000FC1EE]
But what can we do?

Id: [0x000FC1EF]
I will not put words between your teeth, but I am going to pack my things and travel to Letopolis. Master Taharqa is building a wonderful place for all.

Id: [0x000FC1F0]
It is tempting... but all my family is here. You are lucky to have no wife or children, you can just leave.

Id: [0x000FC20B]
The hyena can't be far. If I don't bring those scavengers the ring, they'll only get themselves into more trouble.

Id: [0x000FC20C]
They better stick to their word.

Id: [0x000FC20D]
Should we take him to the bureau?

Id: [0x000FC217]
I know by your walk you've discovered who he is.

Id: [0x000FC218]
Eudoros.

Id: [0x000FC219]
Let us have done with him. He spends hours in the bath house stalking young boys. He will be vulnerable there.

Id: [0x000FC21B]
Eudoros will not linger in the waters forever. Let this be the day of his death.

Id: [0x000FC21F]
I have killed the Snake.

Id: [0x000FC220]
You could not bring happier news.

Id: [0x000FC222]
I rejoice that the Snake is dead.

Id: [0x000FC226]
It's too dangerous to leave this den as long as Gennadios and his men are searching for me.

Id: [0x000FC228]
I cannot leave this den as long as Gennadios lives.

Id: [0x000FC22B]
And what of Gennadios?

Id: [0x000FC22D]
Kill the Snake. I will meet you at the Paneum.

Id: [0x000FC22E]
You need not worry about him any longer. He is dead.

Id: [0x000FC240]
That's all of them and I still have not found them.  ''Her majesty'' has some explaining to do.

Id: [0x000FC24B]
You are my Medjay now! Protector of the true Pharaoh of Egypt.

Id: [0x000FC24F]
I am Medjay you dishonorable dog!

Id: [0x000FC250]
I have the authority here, Medjay. Guards!

Id: [0x000FC254]
Sobek has left the fate of this gold with you. You can return to the temple, or to your family. The choice is yours.

Id: [0x000FC255]
Whatever you do, do it honorably. Egypt needs priests who do not wear masks.

Id: [0x000FC28D]
He has been ordering the burnings. He thinks he is a god, and invincible.

Id: [0x000FC291]
You go your way, I'll go mine! I get it, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FC293]
The Medjay returns. Could not stay away, huh?

Id: [0x000FC29A]
So what now? The fires are stopped. Your farms are safe.

Id: [0x000FC29B]
Ready your blade, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FC2A2]
Break me out, will you?

Id: [0x000FC2AA]
Perhaps he valued freedom more.

Id: [0x000FC2AF]
Look, I don't care if that pox-ridden cunnus lives or dies, but he stole my sword. Caesar gave me that in my final fight and I want it back.

Id: [0x000FC2B1]
You know another Caesar? Alright, Lads, come show this Egyptian some Roman courtesies!

Id: [0x000FC2B5]
Polymestor did not kill these people, they helped him. Maybe he reached the fishing village?

Id: [0x000FC2B6]
Stab wounds and from many swords. Unless the lions came armed, they did not kill these people.

Id: [0x000FC2B7]
Speared, then tortured. For what? Information?

Id: [0x000FC2B8]
They shot him in the back. Was he trying to escape or hide?

Id: [0x000FC2BB]
These are not the words of a murderer.

Id: [0x000FC2C5]
That was a battle to make Charon weep! Thank you…

Id: [0x000FC2C6]
Bayek.

Id: [0x000FC2CD]
I have turned you into a pirate, Sir Bayek! A swindler of the seven seas!

Id: [0x000FC2CE]
Hahaha... Eh, I must admit this is one of your more enlivening schemes, Mouse.

Id: [0x000FC2CF]
It is good to hear your laugh, my friend. I've arranged to meet the man at the ruins on the coast. Come there with the "plunder".

Id: [0x000FC2D1]
Good joy! We will regroup with my men in Bacchias. Come along.

Id: [0x000FC2D2]
Where is it, weasel? Where's the smuggler's boodle.

Id: [0x000FC2D3]
No! You will not cheat me out of my new life. Give me my farm!

Id: [0x000FC2D6]
He was just another liar and cheat.

Id: [0x000FC2DA]
Where will you go now?

Id: [0x000FC2E3]
You must be wondering why I have reached out to you. It was written, you see. That you would come. To this particular chamber, at this very moment in time.

Id: [0x000FC2E4]
The walls told us of your coming, when we once were.

Id: [0x000FC2E5]
Look at them. Are they not fascinating?

Id: [0x000FC2E8]
These walls tell of a tragic story. A story we transcribed on our structures, on our artifacts. A story we could not alter. A mystery, defying us, in plain sight.

Id: [0x000FC2E9]
We tried. Our scholars and scientists. Poets and Physicists. Bright minds. Rebellious hearts.

Id: [0x000FC2EA]
They all tried so hard to bring about change.

Id: [0x000FC2EB]
They... We all failed.

Id: [0x000FC2EC]
None could change what we discovered, the stories written into the walls of these rooms.

Id: [0x000FC2ED]
By whom, we never knew.

Id: [0x000FC2EE]
We know they tell of the future that is, the future that was, and the future that is yet to come.

Id: [0x000FC2EF]
The (INAUDIBLE).

Id: [0x000FC2F0]
We failed at modifying a line. We failed at adding a single dot.

Id: [0x000FC2F1]
It was clear. We were to be messengers at best. But messengers to whom?

Id: [0x000FC2F5]
Retransmission. Segment 3. Acquiring Contemporaneity.

Id: [0x000FC2F6]
It has been 95 days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.

Id: [0x000FC304]
Bacchias is this way.

Id: [0x000FC306]
You are going the wrong way.

Id: [0x000FC308]
You don't want to split up in the desert.

Id: [0x000FC30C]
Dogs! They've sent out scouting groups.

Id: [0x000FC30D]
Theodoros! Derratos has left the camp. He's gone.

Id: [0x000FC30E]
To you

Id: [0x000FC30F]
We removed our ability to read those stories from your original template.

Id: [0x000FC310]
“A doorway that is also a puzzle. We must find the solution”. Those were Brutus's words when he visited the Vault under the Colosseum, more than 2000 years ago.

Id: [0x000FC311]
He drew the vault, sketched it to the best of his abilities. But he could not see.

Id: [0x000FC313]
Just as you are blind. You may read your watch. You may read hourglasses and calendars. But you cannot grasp beyond that simplistic surface. For now, the true reading of time still escapes you.

Id: [0x000FC316]
And so today, the curtain is pulled and the (INAUDIBLE) is shown, tragic and complete.

Id: [0x000FC317]
Those walls, you might never read.

Id: [0x000FC318]
Events yet unfold as written. But something, anything, must change.

Id: [0x000FC319]
You do not understand what is at stake.<LF>

Id: [0x000FC31A]
The reader has no power. He is but an observer. But the author… the author invents the future. The author owns the future.

Id: [0x000FC31B]
A future where (INAUDIBLE)are avoided. A future where a loved one can be revived by the drafting of a new chapter. A future where humankind is more than it is today.

Id: [0x000FC31C]
A future where, just perhaps, we can all still exist, together.

Id: [0x000FC329]
Retransmission. Segment 4. Acquiring Contemporaneity.

Id: [0x000FC32A]
It has been ninety-nine days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.

Id: [0x000FC32D]
On the 21st day of December 2012, Desmond activated the global aurora borealis device and protected the earth from the sun's deadly coronal mass ejection.

Id: [0x000FC32F]
Do you think we'll stage another attack?

Id: [0x000FC330]
Not after coming so close. That man deserves what's coming.

Id: [0x000FC332]
It is a beautiful city, is it not?

Id: [0x000FC333]
I would not know what to compare it to.

Id: [0x000FC334]
Even Athens is nothing compared to Alexandria. I will be sad to leave it.

Id: [0x000FC335]
Have you travelled much, Priest?

Id: [0x000FC336]
No. I came here as a boy, and my memories of Greece are small, but my family love it in Egypt.

Id: [0x000FC337]
As do I, Priest. As do I.

Id: [0x000FC339]
[groans]

Id: [0x000FC33A]
You... You won't get away with this.

Id: [0x000FC33D]
Talk!

Id: [0x000FC33E]
I can't!

Id: [0x000FC33F]
I am Aya's cousin, Phanos.

Id: [0x000FC343]
Stay close to me! Do not let these curs surround you!

Id: [0x000FC344]
I will not let you destroy my great work!

Id: [0x000FC345]
Over here! Drive those neket iadets back!

Id: [0x000FC346]
Celebrate, my friends!

Id: [0x000FC348]
They pour out of the storm!

Id: [0x000FC349]
These reavers fly on the wings of the storm!

Id: [0x000FC34B]
Your blood will water the soil of my home!

Id: [0x000FC34C]
You face the greatest of Egypt!

Id: [0x000FC34D]
Come, Medjay! Fight with me!

Id: [0x000FC34E]
Quick, hunt them down!

Id: [0x000FC350]
Spears of Letopolis, rise up and defend your homes!

Id: [0x000FC351]
Medjay, show them the teeth of justice!

Id: [0x000FC352]
Bayek, do not stray into the storm!

Id: [0x000FC353]
You expected to find our soft bellies, but instead you have found our iron teeth!

Id: [0x000FC355]
These reavers think themselves lions, they are but whipped curs!

Id: [0x000FC356]
Bayek, hunt them down!

Id: [0x000FC357]
Stay with me, Bayek!

Id: [0x000FC358]
Letopolis will stand against you, curs!

Id: [0x000FC359]
Die, you sons of dogs!

Id: [0x000FC35A]
On the 21st day of December 2012, humanity carried on without a care in the world. People went to work, people went to school, and people went to the well for water.

Id: [0x000FC35B]
On the night of December 21st 2012, as the sun set on their days,

Id: [0x000FC35C]
humankind went to bed.

Id: [0x000FC367]
Sweet Ruia! Poor girl!

Id: [0x000FC36B]
The Seer's house sits on the tiniest of islands, as though the land itself draws away in fear of him.

Id: [0x000FC36E]
Come on!

Id: [0x000FC36F]
This ends now!

Id: [0x000FC374]
For Egypt!

Id: [0x000FC375]
For your father, Theodoros!

Id: [0x000FC376]
Derratos dies today!

Id: [0x000FC3D7]
Then, on the morning of December 22nd 2012, humankind was graced with yet another morning. They never knew that on the previous day, the world almost ended.

Id: [0x000FC3D8]
We thought that would have been

Id: [0x000FC3D9]
enough.

Id: [0x000FC3DA]
And it was until it wasn't.

Id: [0x000FC3DC]
Time is unyielding. It always corrects itself.

Id: [0x000FC3DD]
The language of time works in many ways. Two of which you can understand... as you are now.

Id: [0x000FC3DE]
Linear continuity is a simulation that allows for variations. Within the linear continuity, there are nodes. Choke points. Moments where algorithms converge the flows of superposed possibilities to a single moment where only one absolute truth is possible.

Id: [0x000FC3E0]
Paths are fluid,

Id: [0x000FC3E1]
Nodes are static,

Id: [0x000FC3E3]
Your tyranny is over!

Id: [0x000FC3E5]
The temples are always in need of repairs. Maybe I'll talk to the High Priest for work…

Id: [0x000FC3E7]
Get him, Theodoros!

Id: [0x000FC3E8]
Do not clean your blades until all are dead.

Id: [0x000FC3E9]
No one leaves here alive.

Id: [0x000FC3EB]
Well enough. My children flourish. And you? Has your business improved?

Id: [0x000FC3EC]
It has declined, I'm afraid. The curse on the city keeps many worshippers away.

Id: [0x000FC3ED]
My profits go down every week. Sabni is furious, and if the gods are not satisfied soon, I'll have to find another line of work.

Id: [0x000FC3EE]
My soul is troubled for you, friend. I have heard many other such tales of suffering.

Id: [0x000FC3EF]
May the gods wash away our troubles as the rain washes the sky.

Id: [0x000FC3F3]
I never want to see another damned flower in my life.

Id: [0x000FC3F4]
Sharek! Clean all this up.

Id: [0x000FC3F5]
But Mistress Tabiry, what about the festival?

Id: [0x000FC3F6]
It's postponed again.

Id: [0x000FC3F9]
And if that beast doesn't get better soon, we'll have no festival at all.

Id: [0x000FC3FA]
Oh no, Mistress Tabiry! Don't say that!

Id: [0x000FC3FB]
Why couldn't Apis inhabit a giant rock instead of a bull?

Id: [0x000FC3FC]
Oh, Mistress Tabiry! That's blasphemy you're speaking!

Id: [0x000FC3FD]
I can't help it if the gods drive me to disrespect them. Now go get something to clean this up with!

Id: [0x000FC3FF]
Hey! Careful there, big guy.

Id: [0x000FC400]
No! Do not leave me here. I need to get out of this place.

Id: [0x000FC401]
Psstt. I'll immortalize you in poetry... if you get me out of here.

Id: [0x000FC403]
Quickly, warrior. The cauldron.

Id: [0x000FC405]
Place the cauldron now. The god will not stay with us long.

Id: [0x000FC408]
My lady cannot hear you. She has gone to the Moist Land.

Id: [0x000FC40E]
How do you fair these days?

Id: [0x000FC410]
What you have to say to her must be said later.

Id: [0x000FC411]
Medjay! Your travels have brought you this way again!

Id: [0x000FC412]
Better. We are slowly making a life here.

Id: [0x000FC413]
I have one small bit of news for you. I found the bootlicker who stole your spear. He is no longer a threat to anyone.

Id: [0x000FC414]
Hah! That news delights me! I hope you found the Serpent of Serapis, and it served you well!

Id: [0x000FC415]
It did indeed. Thank you, neb.

Id: [0x000FC417]
Aya!

Id: [0x000FC41B]
You said dreams troubled your mind. Do you want to tell me of them?

Id: [0x000FC41C]
No. I would rather not burden you.

Id: [0x000FC41D]
Derratos was a terror on this area.

Id: [0x000FC41F]
It's finally over. We did it.

Id: [0x000FC420]
Yes. May our victories multiply.

Id: [0x000FC421]
[groans] What did I do to deserve this?

Id: [0x000FC422]
Is someone there? Hello? Get me out of here! They will be back any moment!

Id: [0x000FC424]
You there! Are you here to kill me or to be my friend?

Id: [0x000FC42B]
It is mine!

Id: [0x000FC42C]
Hand it over.

Id: [0x000FC42D]
I deserve it!

Id: [0x000FC430]
Son of Ra? He will soon be the Son of Nothing. Into the desert we go, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FC433]
If you stare deeply enough into any madness, there is a logic.

Id: [0x000FC435]
I will wait for you here!

Id: [0x000FC438]
I want nothing more than to see my notes again.

Id: [0x000FC43B]
The Lizard?

Id: [0x000FC43C]
I believe so.

Id: [0x000FC43D]
Hmm. No trace of Anta or the notes. The bandit's stash is likely guarded deep inside their hideout.

Id: [0x000FC43E]
I'm right behind you, Anta.

Id: [0x000FC43F]
Come on, girl.

Id: [0x000FC440]
Excited, aren't you?

Id: [0x000FC441]
You will see them soon enough.

Id: [0x000FC445]
Corteseos' notes must be elsewhere.

Id: [0x000FC446]
You haven't seen him? He's the most harrowing of them all. Big and strong! He's the one who took Anta.

Id: [0x000FC447]
Hm... He might have Corteseos' notes. Probably using them to locate treasures.

Id: [0x000FC448]
The High Priest's wife has been poisoned.

Id: [0x000FC4AD]
Well? What did you find?

Id: [0x000FC4AE]
A papyrus of the pyramids. She's been mapping them for some time. She must be hiding there.

Id: [0x000FC4AF]
Oh, I see. Err, ahem... For a price, I can tell you which pyramid she's in!

Id: [0x000FC4B0]
Thank you. I will manage.

Id: [0x000FC4B5]
May Sobek be with you.

Id: [0x000FC4B6]
I will slip around behind them.

Id: [0x000FC4B7]
For the love of Ra, we cannot let them burn my house too Bayek!

Id: [0x000FC4B8]
They think they can ambush us.

Id: [0x000FC4B9]
Stay low.

Id: [0x000FC4BA]
Very sneaky!

Id: [0x000FC4BB]
Your sneak attack needs work.

Id: [0x000FC4BC]
Hepzefa! Give me a hand!

Id: [0x000FC4BE]
Come.

Id: [0x000FC4C0]
Who are you to give commands to me?

Id: [0x000FC4C3]
You piece of shit, we don't have time to piss away.

Id: [0x000FC4C6]
Hotephres sent me. I am here to help. And I have your daughter's doll.

Id: [0x000FC4C7]
Great. I was awaiting word from my man. Thank you, come, eat and we can talk.

Id: [0x000FC4C8]
Sobek's children butchered and turned into money sacks! Those godless neks!

Id: [0x000FC4C9]
Chests full of treasure. This corrupt scheme has been going on for some time.

Id: [0x000FC4D3]
Keep back! This doesn't concern any of you. Carry on with… whatever it is you do.

Id: [0x000FC4D4]
Another murder! Amun, how horrible!

Id: [0x000FC4D5]
It's the young priest from the temple. God's save us!

Id: [0x000FC4D6]
Who will be next? No-one is safe!

Id: [0x000FC4D7]
It is this cursed temple. I told you. It is a blasphemy! The god's are angry!

Id: [0x000FC4D8]
Move back! Back!

Id: [0x000FC4DA]
Yes, ah… or I could stay up here as lookout! I'll warn if more bandits approach. You go!

Id: [0x000FC4DB]
The Greeks also treat their dead with great honor. And now they suffer like Egyptians.

Id: [0x000FC4DF]
Oh yes, of course, I should have noticed. These people don't understand, our Roman 'friends' do not take kindly to civil disobedience.

Id: [0x000FC4E0]
Why are they protesting?

Id: [0x000FC4E1]
They fear all is not well with our founder, the great Battos.

Id: [0x000FC4E3]
Please, someone should investigate, without alerting the Romans.

Id: [0x000FC4E6]
Your suspicions were well founded. The Romans took Battos' treasure.

Id: [0x000FC4EA]
You have the relics?

Id: [0x000FC4EC]
Those filthy desecrators! I will keep Battos' medallion safe. Legend says if it leaves the city so will our fortunes.

Id: [0x000FC4ED]
Gladly.

Id: [0x000FC4F1]
The founder sent you to us. Farewell, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FC508]
Your reckoning is between you and the gods.

Id: [0x000FC510]
Friend. Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000FC511]
Ah! Then your help, please.

Id: [0x000FC513]
Apollodorus.

Id: [0x000FC516]
When my boy died I fought back, with rage and anger, but this only made them stronger.

Id: [0x000FC51B]
I feel bad for her. But it had to be done.

Id: [0x000FC51C]
There's the torch.

Id: [0x000FC528]
Look out! Protect the healer.

Id: [0x000FC529]
That was close. Let's move.

Id: [0x000FC52D]
Suphia is the one responsible for this. She is by the brazier.

Id: [0x000FC532]
Please forgive me. For a moment I thought you wore the sign of the Medjay, the lost protectors.

Id: [0x000FC533]
I do. I am. What pains you, nebet?

Id: [0x000FC534]
My heart is broken. My truest friend, my husband, Eryx, has been murdered.

Id: [0x000FC535]
Tell me what happened.

Id: [0x000FC536]
He was renowned for his work. A soldier ordered him to build war chariots for the Pharaoh. He was happy to do so.

Id: [0x000FC537]
But when the soldier returned to collect, he only offered to pay half the agreed price. Eryx refused, and the soldier cut him down and stole the chariot.

Id: [0x000FC544]
Leave no one alive! Clear the camp!

Id: [0x000FC545]
Let us overpopulate the Duat!

Id: [0x000FC548]
The Apis Bull is also at the point of death.

Id: [0x000FC54A]
[gibberish]

Id: [0x000FC54D]
The god has closed the outside world to you.

Id: [0x000FC551]
Finally. My father's Ka is at peace.

Id: [0x000FC552]
Derratos has fallen.

Id: [0x000FC554]
Let's move. We have a long trek ahead.

Id: [0x000FC557]
If you are truly a Medjay, will you help me get justice? Find the soldier and destroy the war chariot, so he may not insult my husband's memory!

Id: [0x000FC55A]
How did you cross paths with the bandits, earlier?

Id: [0x000FC55B]
Hmmm? Oh, I enlisted their help to find the missing artifacts.

Id: [0x000FC55C]
What? You mean you hired them?

Id: [0x000FC55D]
Well, their leader, Bellosh, claimed he knew the desert better than anyone. I didn't think they would turn on me. I didn't know they were those kinds of bandits.

Id: [0x000FC55E]
My camp is in the shadow of the last pyramid. Meet me there, at Sneferu's Tomb, when you've found the other artifacts.

Id: [0x000FC562]
I will tell the rebels about this day. Thank you Bayek.

Id: [0x000FC563]
Now I share a story with you, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FC564]
Come visit us in our hideout. I'm sure we could find some more use for you.

Id: [0x000FC568]
Badge? What kind of badge?

Id: [0x000FC569]
A Medjay badge, I think.

Id: [0x000FC56A]
A protector? Hmm. Keep a watch on that one.

Id: [0x000FC56F]
And the wave function collapses the paths into nodes which branch out. Again, and again,

Id: [0x000FC570]
And so I wonder. Can you feel the wave collapsing, trying to course correct Desmond's act of defiance?

Id: [0x000FC571]
The incoming node needs the world to end.

Id: [0x000FC572]
The algorithms have been carving the flow of possibilities towards that end for over one hundred years now.

Id: [0x000FC574]
A labyrinth of trenches, filled with mud and mustard gas.

Id: [0x000FC575]
Families cowering in fear as V2'S vaporize their dwellings.

Id: [0x000FC576]
Fire born from the bellows of the Los Alamos Laboratory, fueling global catastrophes.

Id: [0x000FC577]
The Serpukhov-15 incident of 1983.

Id: [0x000FC579]
The node is near.

Id: [0x000FC57B]
Perhaps you knew. Perhaps you felt it too.

Id: [0x000FC57C]
That the world is closing in on you.

Id: [0x000FC648]
You said there have been other murders?

Id: [0x000FC649]
Serapis' face is hidden and defaced with more green paint. A green mask of Wadjet has been placed here.

Id: [0x000FC64A]
But how did they get up here carrying all of this?

Id: [0x000FC651]
That farm has been torched as if by Ra himself. There is nothing left.

Id: [0x000FC656]
The people love you, Caesar. You're a god.

Id: [0x000FC657]
The Senate will not bow so easily.

Id: [0x000FC658]
That parliament of clucking hens? Let me be your wolf.

Id: [0x000FC65D]
This looks like the place the Stonemason told me about.

Id: [0x000FC661]
Those are guards. This must be the place. The "Bathing Sobek" should be close.

Id: [0x000FC667]
You are meddling with the affairs of the Order. The Order is greater than Rome.

Id: [0x000FC668]
You make me understand why murder is just.

Id: [0x000FC66C]
I command armies! I control greatness.

Id: [0x000FC66D]
I will erase your Order from the annals.

Id: [0x000FC672]
Hahah! Run, you Egyptian dog!

Id: [0x000FC673]
Your kind are all cowards and carrion eaters!

Id: [0x000FC674]
Go cry over your dead girl, Egyptian.

Id: [0x000FC675]
This villa is mine, get out!

Id: [0x000FC67F]
Freedom is not given, Caesar. It is taken.

Id: [0x000FC686]
You are friends with Mered?

Id: [0x000FC687]
Barely. He is a necessary ally.

Id: [0x000FC688]
Mered rarely keeps protectors as allies.

Id: [0x000FC689]
He doesn't trust authorities. But he pays well.

Id: [0x000FC68A]
And very few pay at all here in Giza. Cannot trust the sand in your hand.

Id: [0x000FC68B]
What can you tell me of the Hyena? This Khaliset girl?

Id: [0x000FC68C]
Ha ha! We speak one word and we are Hyena food. Nice try.

Id: [0x000FC68D]
Come on! Be on guard, we have a horse to retrieve.

Id: [0x000FC692]
So this is the Hyena's lair. No sign of Khaliset though.

Id: [0x000FC693]
Khaliset is clearly working with the Order. And they don't know she took some of this silica for herself.

Id: [0x000FC694]
I'll head to the pyramids.

Id: [0x000FC6AB]
The passage is blocked. A strange barrier.

Id: [0x000FC6AF]
I am sure Anta is a good friend, but Giza is no place for such foolishness.

Id: [0x000FC6B2]
And I want my money back.

Id: [0x000FC6B4]
So Anta, you are a protector too?

Id: [0x000FC6B6]
You were right. I trusted the wrong goddess

Id: [0x000FC6B7]
And no matter how small, our brotherhood is the only hope and our kingdom needs no crowns. What we believe in, our values, our creed, will unify us.

Id: [0x000FC6C3]
Still looking for the cyclosporine? I definitely packed it in the med kit.

Id: [0x000FC6CA]
Soris! Stay back!

Id: [0x000FC6E8]
At night, he rests within the courtyard. During the day, you can find him working around the temple or at the terrace overlooking the lake.

Id: [0x000FC6EC]
Medjay! Your help is needed... again. My idiot son left my offering in his papyrus. Which he lost. I cannot sell my oil without giving thanks!

Id: [0x000FC6ED]
I didn't lose it. The guards took it. That papyrus is my life, Medjay!

Id: [0x000FC6EE]
They go too far, these guards.

Id: [0x000FC6EF]
The papyrus had my notes! Those bastards threw it on a boat.

Id: [0x000FC6F1]
I will look into this, Tefibi. And I will find your offering, little mother.

Id: [0x000FC6F5]
So, Ms. Marvel, did you find what you're looking for yet?

Id: [0x000FC6F6]
She has arranged a symposium with others of influence in Faiyum. Every night she retires to her villa, where she courts their favor with bribes and silvered words.

Id: [0x000FC6F7]
Is that what landed you in this cage?

Id: [0x000FC6FB]
I know Aya is here.

Id: [0x000FC6FF]
Help! Help me! Please!

Id: [0x000FC700]
Do not... Do not let her take me!

Id: [0x000FC701]
I do not want to die!

Id: [0x000FC703]
Please! Get me out!

Id: [0x000FC707]
Mercy. Thank you, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FC708]
The Hyena. Where is she?

Id: [0x000FC709]
I do not know. I am... I'm the only one left! She took the others away hours ago!

Id: [0x000FC70A]
Took them where?

Id: [0x000FC70B]
She kills them! I know it! She... She... Her hands. Oh, gods! Her hands are so bloody.

Id: [0x000FC70E]
Come visit us if you ever get the chance. May Hapi watch over you, and ensure your beer cup ever overflows.

Id: [0x000FC712]
Well, I can't chew my way out of here.

Id: [0x000FC715]
Onwards and upwards.

Id: [0x000FC71E]
... Though I guess we can be thankful he was not crucified. Bloody Romans, they do not understand our ways.

Id: [0x000FC723]
[Hissing]You are a cow.

Id: [0x000FC726]
continuous.

Id: [0x000FC727]
changeless.

Id: [0x000FC72B]
I have to do this. It's them or me.

Id: [0x000FC730]
[wince]

Id: [0x000FC732]
[grunt]

Id: [0x000FC734]
Fuck.

Id: [0x000FC736]
[gasp]

Id: [0x000FC73C]
Dammit, my papers went everywhere!

Id: [0x000FC73D]
Whoops! Anything important?

Id: [0x000FC73E]
Yeah. The notes on the Animus.

Id: [0x000FC73F]
I'll have to track them all down.

Id: [0x000FC740]
Bion! What a mess.

Id: [0x000FC741]
I just got a job. I love it here.

Id: [0x000FC742]
(Screams.)

Id: [0x000FC743]
My mother! Oh no, what can we do? Something is wrong!

Id: [0x000FC745]
Amun, this is written in blood. It is still wet!

Id: [0x000FC746]
The murderers are going to kill the High Priest next. We have to find him.

Id: [0x000FC747]
The Phylakitai should know where he is.

Id: [0x000FC748]
I may be of some use to you. I am not unfamiliar with murder scenes.

Id: [0x000FC74D]
We can see the whole area from the temple wall.

Id: [0x000FC756]
I am still your Queen.

Id: [0x000FC75F]
Witness me Cyrenaica! O Great and Exalted Flavius has come! The Lion is upon us!

Id: [0x000FC764]
For Flavius! His Order is God.

Id: [0x000FC765]
Our King, Our Lion, Our God. Most venerated Flavius.

Id: [0x000FC766]
Flavius makes our farms prosper, our children fat.

Id: [0x000FC76F]
I'm going to find every stone circle. The Sphinx and the pyramids too. And I'll find my place.

Id: [0x000FC77A]
Flavius is the God who walks amongst us.

Id: [0x000FC77B]
We will follow you to Rome, Proconsul.

Id: [0x000FC77C]
Scorch the unbelievers with your inferno.

Id: [0x000FC77D]
Flavius will save Cyrene from us unworthy!

Id: [0x000FC77E]
Flavius our God. I was found wanting in his sight.

Id: [0x000FC785]
None shall take the healing weed.

Id: [0x000FC786]
Silphium shall only fall to Roman scythes.

Id: [0x000FC787]
By order of Flavius, Silphium belongs to the Republic.

Id: [0x000FC788]
Anyone stealing silphium will be executed!

Id: [0x000FC789]
Do not touch! Do not touch!

Id: [0x000FC78B]
Taking silphium is punishable with death.

Id: [0x000FC78C]
Stay away, these silphium fields are the property of the Republic.

Id: [0x000FC792]
Get away from her, Philippa only has eyes for me!

Id: [0x000FC793]
No! We're getting married! The proconsul Flavius himself decreed it.

Id: [0x000FC794]
But she is my sunshine!

Id: [0x000FC795]
You will never have her! Flavius said she was mine and mine alone.

Id: [0x000FC796]
You will not keep me from her. I'll appeal to the proconsul!

Id: [0x000FC797]
Flavius will have you hanged!

Id: [0x000FC798]
Philippa, my love, if I die bury me under our tree in the orchard. Where we… that one beautiful night.

Id: [0x000FC799]
What? Is this true, Philippa did you give yourself to him?

Id: [0x000FC79A]
Twice.

Id: [0x000FC79B]
No! No!

Id: [0x000FC79C]
The things she did to me, her soft breath on my neck, her warm... well you can imagine.

Id: [0x000FC79D]
Flavius, give me justice!

Id: [0x000FC7AE]
Where is Khaliset taking captives? And why?

Id: [0x000FC7BA]
Flavius has decreed, all silphium is Roman silphium.

Id: [0x000FC7C8]
Worship him, worship him. Mars incarnate, Flavius of Cyrene!

Id: [0x000FC7CA]
Do you hear the beautiful music?

Id: [0x000FC7CB]
I honor you Leo! Your mane is made of topaz and your claws are silver.

Id: [0x000FC7CE]
Flavius' roar will shake the very foundations of Rome.

Id: [0x000FC7CF]
Dance, dance, dance for Flavius!

Id: [0x000FC7D0]
We will have a Bacchanal!

Id: [0x000FC7D1]
Scavengers and swindlers! Visitors and deserters!

Id: [0x000FC7D2]
Are you tired of this barren landscape? Tired of not knowing what tomorrow will bring?

Id: [0x000FC7D7]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x000FC7DC]
Do you long for something more? A better life?

Id: [0x000FC7DD]
Then look no further than the great city of Letopolis! Many have already claimed a home of their own from the generous master Taharqa.

Id: [0x000FC7F2]
I must honor him, Flavius, our leader, our liberator. The Lion.

Id: [0x000FC7F8]
Listen! Listen! The Lion cast his gaze upon me and I was with child!

Id: [0x000FC7F9]
Have you seen the proconsul? The most comely man in Cyrene, nay, the world!

Id: [0x000FC7FA]
Slender arrows are lodged in my heart. Love vexes the chest that it has seized.

Id: [0x000FC7FB]
O Moon, you cannot share the same night as Flavius. Sun your light dims next to his radiance.

Id: [0x000FC7FC]
Stars blink out, tides hold back. For you are nothing next to the Lion of Rome.

Id: [0x000FC7FD]
Flavius! Flavius! We must all sing his name!

Id: [0x000FC801]
In his new Letopolis, there is only comfort and security.

Id: [0x000FC803]
Put your trust in master Taharqa, and reclaim the life you deserve.

Id: [0x000FC805]
Faster, big man. We have a revolution to make happen.

Id: [0x000FC806]
Ah, carried to safety. An experience like no other.

Id: [0x000FC807]
Will you be still.

Id: [0x000FC808]
Ah, this reminds me of my youth on stage. I was an excellent sack of grain in my premiere appearance.

Id: [0x000FC809]
I pray you, be quiet.

Id: [0x000FC80D]
My boy! My poor boy. Did you see? Did you see what he made me do?

Id: [0x000FC80F]
I don't want those merchants selling their filthy goods so close to my residence!

Id: [0x000FC810]
Tell them I'll buy them out if they agree to take their business elsewhere.

Id: [0x000FC816]
You wanted to speak to us?

Id: [0x000FC81A]
You are no match for me, desert scum.

Id: [0x000FC81B]
I will bury you in the sand, fool.

Id: [0x000FC81C]
Come! Fight me if you must. Then your blood will be part of my daughter's resurrection.

Id: [0x000FC81F]
Stupid hayseeds. You don't resist the Roman army.

Id: [0x000FC821]
Round up any one left alive, General wants them for the citadel.

Id: [0x000FC822]
That old woman, the way she looked, like she was putting a curse on me.

Id: [0x000FC823]
Vitruvius will want to know his formula is in safer hands.

Id: [0x000FC828]
I will await among the people at the docks.

Id: [0x000FC829]
So I said… it's not your pig I'm talking about, it's your wife.

Id: [0x000FC82F]
May your happiness multiply.

Id: [0x000FC831]
and again.

Id: [0x000FC835]
Romans are not welcome despite our Pharaoh's alliance!

Id: [0x000FC836]
Cats are gods!

Id: [0x000FC83D]
Are you Sekhmet in disguise? Sent to test me?

Id: [0x000FC83E]
We must stop at the market for more linens.

Id: [0x000FC83F]
I will take you to your house as your father bade, and nowhere else. Now, lead on.

Id: [0x000FC840]
I do not love you! I told you already!

Id: [0x000FC841]
I would rather die.

Id: [0x000FC842]
Don't worry, my father will drench you in drachmas as promised.

Id: [0x000FC847]
Aristo's work is fine. A peripatetic philosopher, it's a shame what has happened to him.

Id: [0x000FC848]
Intellectual theft is a serious crime. Strabo agrees. Yet our King's regime is too busy with ceremony.

Id: [0x000FC849]
Imagine: free elections in Egypt? Alexandria could be a thriving city-state.

Id: [0x000FC84A]
Not if the Aristos of the world are locked away, shunned, oppressed. The Polis suffers when free will is crushed.

Id: [0x000FC84B]
As long as we have access to the Gymnasium we shall fill papyri with our ideas.

Id: [0x000FC84C]
I love you Homerus. Let us drink wine and celebrate the Alexandrian Pleiad and salute our dear friend Aristo.

Id: [0x000FC84E]
You cowards! Stand up for what is just!

Id: [0x000FC850]
I am a friend of Phanos! A protector.

Id: [0x000FC851]
Be wary! His hair! He has bugs. Bugs!

Id: [0x000FC856]
I cannot believe they beat an old man.

Id: [0x000FC857]
This new generation of Alexandrian poets seems to be of a new order.

Id: [0x000FC858]
They certainly take risks.

Id: [0x000FC859]
Give them my regards, will you. It is ever harder to produce good works here.

Id: [0x000FC85B]
They may jail me, but I will not sell my blood to the death merchants of this regime!

Id: [0x000FC85C]
I'm worried about Phanos. Did you see his latest play? It was very dark.

Id: [0x000FC85D]
He is a poet. They have other passions.

Id: [0x000FC85E]
If it lands in the wrong hands, Phanos will be in danger.

Id: [0x000FC87D]
You! You have returned.

Id: [0x000FC87E]
To right your wrong.

Id: [0x000FC87F]
I die, my work unfinished. So close, so very close to ushering in the perpetual rule of the strong and virtuous!

Id: [0x000FC880]
Virtue?

Id: [0x000FC882]
The vault will give us the power of the gods. What is one boy?

Id: [0x000FC883]
Here! Here! And here is your "nobody".

Id: [0x000FC885]
May the Hidden One greet you. The lord of the Duat awaits.

Id: [0x000FC887]
My son, you wanted the stars…

Id: [0x000FC8BC]
The stars are yours now, and your place is with them.

Id: [0x000FC8F9]
O' great and ferocious Flavius!

Id: [0x000FC8FA]
All hail the mighty mane of Flavius.

Id: [0x000FC8FB]
Do not anger him, Flavius the lusty, the indomitable!

Id: [0x000FC8FC]
Follow Flavius! Follow the Lion.

Id: [0x000FC8FD]
Leo Flavius, grant me wealth, happiness and health.

Id: [0x000FC8FE]
My crops are failing, Leo please send your divine rain.

Id: [0x000FC8FF]
His claws will be stained with the blood of our enemies.

Id: [0x000FC906]
Even when your kind appears to triumph, still shall we rise again. The Order of Ancients is born of a realization.

Id: [0x000FC907]
Sons of Prometheus you will follow us. Only by serving the Order can you be saved.

Id: [0x000FC909]
The free will advocated by these tricksters does not exist. Do not listen to them. They claim the people should be free to make their own choices.

Id: [0x000FC90A]
Every event, every human decision, every action, is the inexorable consequence of what came before. Progress demands sacrifice.

Id: [0x000FC90C]
Nothing happens randomly. All events we witness, we experience, happen for a reason and by necessity.

Id: [0x000FC90D]
They think they can break the shallow chains of determinism?

Id: [0x000FC90E]
I'm looking for a Gabiniani named Venator.

Id: [0x000FC911]
Shhh. Do not say that name!

Id: [0x000FC913]
The foreman sent a guard to check on us? We were not complaining! We were working hard!

Id: [0x000FC914]
I am not a guard, I am a Medjay from Siwa. Does he treat you badly? The work here looks back-breaking.

Id: [0x000FC915]
No! Compared to the Siwans up at the aqueduct we are revered like pharaohs!

Id: [0x000FC916]
I would not go that far.

Id: [0x000FC918]
Are there problems at the aqueduct?

Id: [0x000FC919]
Some snooty engineer, Vitruvius. He is working our countrymen to death. And now the Roman army is involved. Which is never good…

Id: [0x000FC91B]
I will see what is going on, seni.

Id: [0x000FC92C]
That was extraordinary! Well done. Who sent you?

Id: [0x000FC92E]
Was it Kition or Heraclides? They thought I couldn't handle myself out here, but we've shown them, haven't we?

Id: [0x000FC92F]
Have we? What are you doing out here?

Id: [0x000FC939]
What makes you think the third artefact is in the Shining Pyramid?

Id: [0x000FC93A]
These pyramids were built by Pharaoh Sneferu during his reign, you see. He took what Imhotep had designed for Pharaoh Djoser, and improved upon it.

Id: [0x000FC93B]
Then came the Bent. Its unique shape is due to an alteration that saved it from suffering the same fate as its brother.

Id: [0x000FC93C]
The Meidum and the Bent could not keep their secrets from me. Inside each, I found the artifacts indicated in Manetho's Aegyptiaca. You've read it, yes?

Id: [0x000FC95B]
Behind, man!

Id: [0x000FC95C]
To the back!

Id: [0x000FC95D]
There's a lot of them behind us!

Id: [0x000FC961]
I am working on it!

Id: [0x000FC962]
Work more quickly!

Id: [0x000FC963]
We're surrounded!

Id: [0x000FC96C]
I hear more gaining on us!

Id: [0x000FC96D]
I am shooting as fast as I can, Roman.

Id: [0x000FC978]
That is not good.

Id: [0x000FC979]
What is it?

Id: [0x000FC97A]
Hope we don't find out, Caesar. Faster! Perhaps we can outrun it!

Id: [0x000FC97B]
The only thing that waits for you is oblivion. For your name, your Order and the rotting corpses of your Gabiniani.

Id: [0x000FC97F]
I have an idea.

Id: [0x000FC98B]
We will face it. Ready yourself, Caesar. This is worse than any battle you've yet had.

Id: [0x000FC98C]
It can't be that bad!

Id: [0x000FC98D]
It is Osiris himself.

Id: [0x000FC999]
Sometimes, ritual is all that stands between a man and madness.

Id: [0x000FC99A]
Each time I feel my body locked in combat, my wounds crushed against those I have inflicted…

Id: [0x000FC99B]
Each time I feel the ka tearing free, I pay it tribute with a prayer.

Id: [0x000FC99C]
This prayer is not for the dead, or for the gods. It is for me.

Id: [0x000FC99D]
My creed gives the meaningless meaning, and shapes the formless.

Id: [0x000FC99E]
Without it, I could not kill.

Id: [0x000FC99F]
You would not want to hear the words that make me capable of killing.

Id: [0x000FC9A2]
What is this about?

Id: [0x000FC9A3]
Tell me, how do you make sense of it?

Id: [0x000FC9A6]
(INAUDIBLE)

Id: [0x000FC9AC]
You still can be done with this. Be free of this battle.

Id: [0x000FC9B8]
Hmm, I don't yet have everything you asked for.

Id: [0x000FC9B9]
No matter. I have enough work to keep me busy until you return with what I need.

Id: [0x000FC9CC]
The lightest heart could not afford such a weight.

Id: [0x000FC9D7]
By Amun, she's fast.

Id: [0x000FC9DA]
Sweet Serapis, where did you come from? Back! Back you beast! I will turn you into leather armor!

Id: [0x000FC9DC]
Anyone! Help! Please!

Id: [0x000FC9DD]
What brings you this way?

Id: [0x000FCA0F]
The herd is around here. We don't want just any stag. We want the pack leader.

Id: [0x000FCA10]
Which one is he?

Id: [0x000FCA11]
Big with giant horns. Quiet now. Do what I do.

Id: [0x000FCA12]
There's the herd.

Id: [0x000FCA13]
This is my favourite part, stay low! They will spot us unless we become like Amun, the god of Hiddenness.

Id: [0x000FCA14]
Yes papo, we are the Hidden Ones.

Id: [0x000FCA15]
See? My eyes and hand are in line with the arrow.

Id: [0x000FCA16]
That is the only way to shoot true.

Id: [0x000FCA17]
I wish I could put a hundred arrows on this bow.

Id: [0x000FCA18]
Ahhh! Oh no! I scared them!

Id: [0x000FCA19]
[kindly] It's okay, more time for us to spend together! Enjoy the journey.

Id: [0x000FCA1A]
Me too papo.

Id: [0x000FCA1B]
Stay with me. We can do it together.

Id: [0x000FCA1C]
[quiet awe] Holy Anubis! Is that him? He's huge!

Id: [0x000FCA1D]
That is him all right. Let's see what we can do.

Id: [0x000FCA1E]
Senu! Senu, come to me!

Id: [0x000FCA1F]
Why are you calling Senu?

Id: [0x000FCA20]
Hit!

Id: [0x000FCA21]
Did you hurt him?

Id: [0x000FCA22]
A clean shot to the heart hardly hurts at all. Let's get that pelt.

Id: [0x000FCA23]
Papo! He's running away!

Id: [0x000FCA24]
Patience, my boy. We will get him.

Id: [0x000FCA37]
Bayek! Our Medjay! You're back!

Id: [0x000FCA38]
What happened to your blacksmith shop?

Id: [0x000FCA39]
Those neket iadet soldiers. Ptolemy's captain saw me making a sword and accused me of being a rebel.

Id: [0x000FCA3A]
They confiscated my tools!

Id: [0x000FCA3B]
Bastards. All of Siwa needs a blacksmith. Even me.

Id: [0x000FCA3C]
I cannot help you Bayek. Not until I get my hammer and tongs back. And I have to get that ugly-as-Apep captain off my ass!

Id: [0x000FCA3D]
Is this captain with the tools somewhere I can find him?

Id: [0x000FCA3E]
At the foot of the hills west of here. Camp Shetjeh.

Id: [0x000FCA3F]
I will get those tools back. And I will take care of the captain.

Id: [0x000FCA4D]
[Nek!](Damn!) No way out.

Id: [0x000FCA4E]
Up there! Light.

Id: [0x000FCA4F]
This wall...

Id: [0x000FCA51]
Chenzira!

Id: [0x000FCA52]
Answer me, Chenzira!

Id: [0x000FCA53]
It's not funny!

Id: [0x000FCA54]
Fenuku! It is dangerous here. Get on home.

Id: [0x000FCA55]
Bayek? You're back?

Id: [0x000FCA56]
Where is Chenzira?

Id: [0x000FCA57]
He wanted to see the skulls in the hyena den.

Id: [0x000FCA58]
But the hyenas came back.

Id: [0x000FCA59]
I ran this way. Chenzira ran over by the tomb.

Id: [0x000FCA5A]
You are lucky the hyenas didn't chase you. Go back to the village. I will find your brother.

Id: [0x000FCA5B]
Um...

Id: [0x000FCA5C]
What?

Id: [0x000FCA5D]
Do I have to tell my parents?

Id: [0x000FCA5E]
Chenzira got you into this. He will have to talk to them. Now go ahead.

Id: [0x000FCA66]
You killed my master and left me for dead. That was a mistake.

Id: [0x000FCA68]
Your master was a murderer.

Id: [0x000FCA71]
That is Horus, the Falcon. The Great Black One. God of the sky. The sun is his right eye and the moon is his left eye. Forever he flies across the heavens, making night and day.

Id: [0x000FCA72]
The eye of Horus is what the Medjay wear?

Id: [0x000FCA73]
Yes, my son. The Pharaoh is Horus in life, and Osiris in death. That is why the Pharaoh rules not only Egypt, but the whole world. Only a true Pharaoh though.

Id: [0x000FCA7A]
Those are the Scales, called Chonsu. When we die, the goddess Ma'at weighs our hearts on them against her white feather.

Id: [0x000FCA7B]
Very good. You were listening. The Scales measure truth and justice. Which is why Medjay pursue these two things above all others.

Id: [0x000FCA86]
I seek entry to this arena. Are you the owner?

Id: [0x000FCA87]
I am. Felix Martialus. But I will tell you right now you cannot afford to be a spectator and I don't take fighters off the street.

Id: [0x000FCA88]
Hold on, master Felix. This man is a Medjay. He could be a worthy gladiator.

Id: [0x000FCA89]
A mad what? Actually, don't answer. I don't even care.

Id: [0x000FCA8A]
Whoever you are, don't take this personally. I'm sure you're as vicious as you look, but any fool can murder a man. Few can do it to please a crowd!

Id: [0x000FCA8B]
Besides, I already have an Egyptian gladiator! A huntress from Siwa who is three times the warrior you'll ever be.

Id: [0x000FCA8C]
Someone from Siwa...?

Id: [0x000FCA8D]
I remember this. If our hearts are pure and light, we walk in the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x000FCAAE]
Papo, you know how you're Egyptian and Mother is Greek. What if Egypt and Greece go to war?

Id: [0x000FCAAF]
Greeks and Egyptians don't hate each other. We're all the same.

Id: [0x000FCAB0]
It feels like they do. A priest in the temple schools said Greeks were destroying Egypt.

Id: [0x000FCAB1]
He was wrong to say that. There is good and bad in everyone.

Id: [0x000FCAB5]
Ah, The Great Twins. To the Greeks they are twin brothers.

Id: [0x000FCABA]
Pisces, the two fish. Joined by the thread of this life, they are forever balanced between the afterlife and the underworld.

Id: [0x000FCACA]
They are off to a good start! These two sand-bandits are tougher than they look!

Id: [0x000FCACD]
The Medjay and the slave girl are unstoppable! More ferocious than wild beasts!

Id: [0x000FCAD2]
The Medjay is not missing his partner! What a warrior!

Id: [0x000FCAD3]
Are you watching, Krokodilopolis? Is this the rise of a new challenger? Will the Gallic brothers keep their crown?

Id: [0x000FCAD4]
There is a new creed now.

Id: [0x000FCAD7]
I ask only this…that you join with me in building a new Rome.

Id: [0x000FCAF5]
I've retrieved the other two artifacts.

Id: [0x000FCAF7]
What are we looking for, at the end of this?

Id: [0x000FCAF8]
Hmm. I will climb up and see what I can find.

Id: [0x000FCB14]
And now, the Herald of Ptah is laid to rest.

Id: [0x000FCB15]
The new bull looked well. What do you think was wrong with him before?

Id: [0x000FCB16]
Oh, I couldn't say. I heard that he was poisoned, but it was probably idle gossip.

Id: [0x000FCB17]
Who would dare to poison a god?

Id: [0x000FCB18]
A braver man than me!

Id: [0x000FCB21]
I would not risk it. My heart is heavy enough as it is.

Id: [0x000FCB7E]
Had you ever seen the queen before?

Id: [0x000FCB7F]
No. Isn't she beautiful?

Id: [0x000FCB80]
Not as beautiful as I expected from the stories.

Id: [0x000FCB81]
But her jewelry… Oh, it's spectacular!

Id: [0x000FCB82]
I would love a necklace like hers. But it is her face I will remember most.

Id: [0x000FCB83]
Truly, she has the look of the goddess. It took Iset's blessing to dispel the city's curse.

Id: [0x000FCB84]
I've killed one of the masked ones. The Heron.

Id: [0x000FCB85]
Four more! Come, it has been a long road. You need rest!

Id: [0x000FCBB8]
I'm not yet convinced that it is dispelled.

Id: [0x000FCBBC]
May the Greatest of Masters of Craftsmen forgive me.

Id: [0x000FCBBD]
I was sure it was he who had brought down the curse upon Memphis.

Id: [0x000FCBBE]
Many thought the same. It is no mark against you.

Id: [0x000FCBBF]
By chance, I spoke to a priest of Anubis at the temple one day when I went to give worship.

Id: [0x000FCBC0]
He whispered darkly into my ear about Pasherenptah.

Id: [0x000FCBC1]
Hinted at abomination of the rites, and other terrible things.

Id: [0x000FCBC2]
The temple must be as thick with plots and jealousies as the court.

Id: [0x000FCBC4]
No, no rest. Not until all the masked one's guts lie baking in the sand.

Id: [0x000FCBC5]
Gods, I have missed you!

Id: [0x000FCBC9]
But there's a passage in the Aegyptiaca that says, "The path is clear atop the Shining tip."

Id: [0x000FCBCA]
I have what I have.

Id: [0x000FCBCB]
Take from the dead soldiers if you like. They have no use for weapons.

Id: [0x000FCBCD]
There are no other kinds of bandits. They all pillage and kill for coin.

Id: [0x000FCBCE]
Yes, they seemed rather intent on both, having stolen one artifact from me and then trying to kill me for the other.

Id: [0x000FCBCF]
You are a hazard to yourself.

Id: [0x000FCBD0]
I've been told that before.

Id: [0x000FCBD1]
Ah hah! This confirms my theory! By Ra! That's it! The artifacts form a diagram, but a part is missing. There's no way to connect them.

Id: [0x000FCBFF]
That takes care of Sefetu's eyes.

Id: [0x000FCC12]
Memphis, you tremble with the pangs of execration!

Id: [0x000FCC13]
Memphis, the city of the ancient gods… the city of dynasties fallen now into dust…

Id: [0x000FCC14]
The legs of Apis tremble as they course with venom. The foam of disease coats his lips.

Id: [0x000FCC15]
The scabrous children of Sobek writhe hungrily onto the very steps of the palace, their pale mouths parting to ambush the unwary.

Id: [0x000FCC16]
A stench of death curdles on the wind. Every gasp and cough chokes our lungs with rot.

Id: [0x000FCC17]
Babies forbear to cry in fear of drawing breath!

Id: [0x000FCC18]
Others wither in the womb, the light of Ra never falling on their skin!

Id: [0x000FCC19]
Memphis, the decaying. Memphis, the holy, waning in the false glitter of Alexandria's waxing.

Id: [0x000FCC1A]
People of the dying city, how will you save yourselves?

Id: [0x000FCC63]
Memphis, your pangs have eased. The cloud of your curse dwindles in the fierce light of mercy.

Id: [0x000FCC93]
Rest, my friend. It has been a difficult day.

Id: [0x000FCC95]
You know me, you should be worried!

Id: [0x000FD97E]
Come along. This way. Uh, you first.

Id: [0x000FD97F]
We are the first to set foot here in more than two thousand years! The treasures that must be here…

Id: [0x000FDB39]
The god-bull's legs are again steady. In his chest throb the lungs of Ptah, the breath of the creator.

Id: [0x000FDB3A]
As the Goddess remains behind you, your enemies will be struck down.

Id: [0x000FDB3B]
He sends his servant, the man of the terrible face, father of the heartless child, defeater of the Snake.

Id: [0x000FDB47]
The god favors him, he who has discovered the names of the animals gnawing at the bowels of Egypt.

Id: [0x000FDB48]
The man of the terrible face delivers those who cannot effect their own deliverance.

Id: [0x000FDB54]
You are humbled by the cold fury of the gods.

Id: [0x000FDB55]
[unintelligible vocal sounds]

Id: [0x000FDB5F]
Hapti's wife will want this as a keepsake.

Id: [0x000FDB6A]
Please understand Bayek, I was not always so focused on architectural wonders such as this aqueduct.

Id: [0x000FDB6B]
As a hotheaded youth I came up with many means of death and destruction. One of those was a Greek Fire of sorts.

Id: [0x000FDB6D]
Curse my pride, I should have burned my notes. General Agrippa must have found them.

Id: [0x000FDB6F]
Then Agrippa must be stopped.

Id: [0x000FDB71]
Where are you going, Bayek?

Id: [0x000FDB72]
Bayek my friend! My apologies, but whatever it is will have to wait till my dioptra has been recovered.

Id: [0x000FDB77]
Oh, oh my! By Ra… all that is divine beauty. Do your eyes see what mine see?

Id: [0x000FDB78]
This room has been perfectly preserved.

Id: [0x000FDB7D]
Untouched since Sneferu's reign!

Id: [0x000FDB82]
We will take this to the Oracle before it gets dark.

Id: [0x000FDB84]
One day I want to shoot an arrow through the sun.

Id: [0x000FDB85]
What if I never grow up to be a Medjay?

Id: [0x000FDB86]
Of course you will. You are my son!

Id: [0x000FDB87]
But I get scared.

Id: [0x000FDB88]
I try to be brave but sometimes it's hard.

Id: [0x000FDB8B]
Hold on. Let's go this way.

Id: [0x000FDB8C]
Where?

Id: [0x000FDB8D]
When I was about your age. Sometimes I got scared, too.

Id: [0x000FDB8E]
Your grandfather was a well-known Medjay, and he wanted me to bring honor to the family when I succeeded him.

Id: [0x000FDB8F]
One day, he took me up this way.

Id: [0x000FDB90]
At the top, he said something to me. A single word. It changed me.

Id: [0x000FDB91]
I got over my fear. I knew I could do anything I needed to.

Id: [0x000FDB92]
What did he say?

Id: [0x000FDB93]
I will tell you once we're there.

Id: [0x000FDB98]
O, High Priestess, can I have a moment of your time?

Id: [0x000FDB99]
How can this servant of Asclepius aid you?

Id: [0x000FDB9A]
Well since Flavius came, several people have gone missing and I am a bit worried.

Id: [0x000FDB9B]
Please follow me to the temple, we shall discuss it further and I will even show you that there is no cause for concern.

Id: [0x000FDBE2]
He will be tanning hides for a few days.

Id: [0x000FDBE3]
If only there were some way for him to deal with the stink.

Id: [0x000FDBF7]
It feels good to get out and fight! I am out of practice. In Siwa, everyone defers to the soldiers on pain of death... or worse.

Id: [0x000FDBF9]
By the god Amun, Bayek, these dead hoplites are better equipped than you. You will not survive long with that weapon.

Id: [0x000FDC03]
The investigations of Harkuf's agents, concerns of the people. Sais is no different than Siwa.

Id: [0x000FDC05]
Are you the one responsible for working my people to death?

Id: [0x000FDC06]
Your people? They are my people, I'm keeping them alive in the face of increasingly bad odds. But who are you, my Egyptian friend?

Id: [0x000FDC08]
Bayek of Siwa. Protector of these people.

Id: [0x000FDC09]
Well Bayek of Siwa, I am Vitruvius and contrary to popular belief not all Romans are your enemy.

Id: [0x000FDC0A]
If you would help your people, then help me. Our tools have been stolen. My surveying tool, the dioptra, specifically.

Id: [0x000FDC0D]
Maybe I can look for this… dioptra?

Id: [0x000FDC0E]
With it, this elevated river would flow into the farms of Cyrenaica. Talk to Dedi up at the construction site. He used it last.

Id: [0x000FDC0F]
Fortuna go with you, Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x000FDC18]
Meidum was the first, but a design flaw led to a grave collapse.

Id: [0x000FDC1C]
I am on the case.

Id: [0x000FDC1D]
Each of the three tombs held one, according to my findings.

Id: [0x000FDC1E]
So you'll remember the third is said to be contained within the Shining Pyramid, his masterpiece.

Id: [0x000FDC1F]
Of course, it's also the pyramid that has stifled my progress.

Id: [0x000FDC20]
Please, Medjay, if I can trouble you… Harkuf's assistant, Nesamun, took a delivery of beer down the southern road.

Id: [0x000FDC21]
He never made it to Yamu. Please, can you find him and make sure he's ok?

Id: [0x000FDC22]
That beer was meant to honor Sekhmet! If he drank all that beer, he'll be whipped!

Id: [0x000FDC24]
The king bids all Greek citizens welcome!

Id: [0x000FDC26]
She has not finished. That is where I will find her.

Id: [0x000FDC5D]
Look at you. Cuts, contusions...

Id: [0x000FDC5E]
I'm fine.

Id: [0x000FDC5F]
Sit, sit, sit. I'll take care of it.

Id: [0x000FDC66]
You haven't changed.

Id: [0x000FDC67]
You and Aya, I've always patched you two up, made excuses to your parents... Times have changed, but you, I can count on.

Id: [0x000FDC83]
Yes, he protects them from cowards like the Scarab and Sefetu.

Id: [0x000FDC85]
You are courageous to protect families that are not your blood.

Id: [0x000FDC88]
Didn't they tell you anything before they sent you after me?

Id: [0x000FDC89]
(laughs)

Id: [0x000FDC8C]
We need to be quick. More will come.

Id: [0x000FDC91]
Sefetu's men are burning everything!

Id: [0x000FDC92]
Stay here. Let me take care of them.

Id: [0x000FDC94]
Find your truth! Spread it. We have finally their taken power!

Id: [0x000FDC97]
Slumbering Osiris, I thought you would never wake up!

Id: [0x000FDC98]
Rabiah patched me up and I just...

Id: [0x000FDC99]
I let you sleep. You need to be alert to tangle with Medunamun. In fact, my friend...

Id: [0x000FDCBB]
Going blindly to kill Medunamun would be suicide, Bayek. He would eat you alive.

Id: [0x000FDCBC]
First...you look like  my friend. Craft yourself a breastplate. That would be a start.

Id: [0x000FDCBD]
Okay okay...I'll go hunting for some leather. Anything else?

Id: [0x000FDCBE]
Weapons. It won't be easy though.

Id: [0x000FDCBF]
they've confiscated almost all we had. I know they store them in their camps.

Id: [0x000FDCC0]
And Benipe, the blacksmith? I guess he can't sell weapons anymore.

Id: [0x000FDCC1]
Exactly...He might need your help on that subject.

Id: [0x000FDCC2]
Actually...You're still a Medjay for the Siwans...they need you and you need them.

Id: [0x000FDCC3]
Explore the city and its surrounding, learn from them, what you've missed in your abscence, that'll make you stronger.

Id: [0x000FDCC4]
You'll have an upper hand on Medunamun.

Id: [0x000FDCC5]
Okay...so where is Medunamun?

Id: [0x000FDCC6]
I actually don't know...maybe in Amun's temple, maybe elsewhere. You should probably use Senu to find him

Id: [0x000FDCC7]
Senu? She's alive?

Id: [0x000FDCC8]
Oh yes. Rabiah took care of him while you were gone.

Id: [0x000FDCC9]
The poor animal was heavily wounded by arrows but she's fine now.

Id: [0x000FDCCA]
Go ahead. Call her!

Id: [0x000FDCCB]
I hope she didn't forget you.

Id: [0x000FDCCC]
You're waiting for...?

Id: [0x000FDCCD]
Come on Bayek...don't be shy!

Id: [0x000FDCCE]
Did you forget how to call her?

Id: [0x000FDCD7]
That does it.

Id: [0x000FDCD8]
It is sad. Come upstairs. I will show you all the Medjay duties of Siwa.

Id: [0x000FDCDA]
All the problems of Siwa are here. I try to help everyone, but it's more than I can do.

Id: [0x000FDCDC]
But the real problem is that man you want to kill: Medunamun. The people were hopeful when he arrived. Surely things would improve.

Id: [0x000FDCE6]
I will find him and kill him.

Id: [0x000FDCE7]
Medunamun is a lot more powerful than he looks and he is surrounded by the finest soldiers.

Id: [0x000FDCE8]
I do not care.

Id: [0x000FDCE9]
You'll be killed. You need to get tougher if you want to murder that spindly shit. For sure you will need better armor.

Id: [0x000FDCEC]
Senu? Senu is alive?

Id: [0x000FDCED]
Rabiah has nursed her to health.

Id: [0x000FDCF3]
Osiris was cut into fourteen pieces by his jealous brother, who scattered the pieces through-out the land.

Id: [0x000FDCF4]
What happened to the other piece?

Id: [0x000FDCF5]
It was eaten by a fish. It was his, ah… So Osiris was resurrected and became lord of the underworld.

Id: [0x000FDCF6]
Oh… so he couldn't have children anymore, huh.

Id: [0x000FDCFA]
You are growing up far too quickly.

Id: [0x000FDCFE]
Osiris, the Father of Gods. Brother of Set who murdered him. It is said that Iset's tears for her beloved husband created the Nile.

Id: [0x000FDCFF]
Papo, when you met mother, how did you know she liked you?

Id: [0x000FDD03]
My heart lit on fire, of course! She smiled at me, and her eyes rendered me helpless.

Id: [0x000FDD04]
So if a girl likes you she smiles at you?

Id: [0x000FDD09]
Son, there are some things I can explain to you. The stars, how to fight.

Id: [0x000FDD0A]
The scorpion goddess, Serqet. She protected Iset and Horus from jealous Set.

Id: [0x000FDD0F]
Have you talked to this girl you like?

Id: [0x000FDD1D]
The bow and medallion are gone. The Romans are little more than tomb robbers!

Id: [0x000FDD36]
I didn't say I liked her. [Sighs] We were friends. But she's being strange and avoiding me.

Id: [0x000FDD37]
Maybe because she likes you too. We often do not say what we mean, it will come to you in bursts.

Id: [0x000FDD38]
Why would she avoid me if she likes me?

Id: [0x000FDD39]
This… is something your mother should explain. I am better with the stars.

Id: [0x000FDD3C]
Apis, the bull god. He is the strength of the Pharaoh. Each year he is born as a calf with special markings.

Id: [0x000FDD4A]
Papo, how do you know if you're in love?

Id: [0x000FDD4B]
Why Khemu? Do you think you are in love?

Id: [0x000FDD4C]
I don't know. Love should feel good. You and mom are the only ones I love. But this hurts. Sometimes I can't even think straight.

Id: [0x000FDD4D]
That sounds like love. It could be. I was once like that. [Pause]I'm very sorry son.

Id: [0x000FDD4F]
The Divine Lion, the powerful one. Her breath formed the desert. The fiercest of hunters, she leads the armies of the Pharaoh into battle.

Id: [0x000FDD53]
Medjay have a duty to the gods. We must be strong, and ready to fight. But we must only fight when it is just.

Id: [0x000FDD57]
I'll practice hard, Papo. I want to be strong and hunt like you do.

Id: [0x000FDD58]
You are already better with your weapons than many men. You'll make a fine Medjay, son.

Id: [0x000FDD59]
Have the Romans no respect for the dead?

Id: [0x000FDD5A]
The tomb's been ransacked. The Romans were looking for something.

Id: [0x000FDD5B]
Empty! Drunk and stupid is a troublesome combination.

Id: [0x000FDD5C]
The founder must have been buried with these treasures.

Id: [0x000FDD5E]
The Goat-Fish, called Capricornus by the Greeks. The god has the head of a ram and the body of a fish. You see, even the gods do not always make sense.

Id: [0x000FDD60]
Papo, why do people die?

Id: [0x000FDD62]
You need to learn how to be a Medjay first.

Id: [0x000FDD67]
We are not gods. Everything must die. It is what Amun has ordained for us.

Id: [0x000FDD68]
Will we be together in the afterlife?

Id: [0x000FDD69]
Be brave and strong. Fight for justice. Do not lie. This is all anyone can do.

Id: [0x000FDD6B]
Papo, do you think I'll have many children?

Id: [0x000FDD6D]
I hope you give your mother and I many grandchildren.

Id: [0x000FDD6E]
I'll have to find a wife, then.

Id: [0x000FDD6F]
You're young, my son. There's no reason to rush.

Id: [0x000FDD70]
I won't rush. But what if I already know?

Id: [0x000FDD73]
Hathor, goddess of motherhood and joy. She is loved by all in Egypt, from the least to the greatest.

Id: [0x000FDD77]
Papo, why are there so many poor in Egypt? Yet those who don't belong here are rich.

Id: [0x000FDD82]
It pains me to ask you for a further favor...

Id: [0x000FDD89]
Hades' fiery crotch! I did not take it, please do not kill me.

Id: [0x000FDD8C]
Dedi, wait!

Id: [0x000FDD8E]
You too, my child?

Id: [0x000FDD90]
The tyrant is dead! You are free now!

Id: [0x000FDD92]
For Egypt? I am Egypt!

Id: [0x000FDDA9]
Egypt has forgotten who she is. Many chose wealth over honor. In the end they got neither, and lost justice as well.

Id: [0x000FDDAA]
But we are Medjay. We will bring justice and honor back to Egypt.

Id: [0x000FDDAB]
Yes, my son. We have not forgotten who we are. We will endure no matter our origin.

Id: [0x000FDDAD]
Amun, the king of gods, divided in two forms as the great goddess of invisiblity Amunet, and master of the wind. He upholds justice.

Id: [0x000FDDB2]
Papo, what is best in life?

Id: [0x000FDDB3]
To seek justice and truth. To live with honor, to protect the weak and the poor. And to love your mother.

Id: [0x000FDDB4]
My friend Kenon said it was to crush our enemies, and to hear the lamentations of their women.

Id: [0x000FDDB5]
We are Medjay son, not barbarians.

Id: [0x000FDDBB]
Ah!

Id: [0x000FDDBC]
I doubt it little man.

Id: [0x000FDDC0]
I fear for the safety of your family, priest. I will move them to a more secure area.

Id: [0x000FDDC3]
That is the man you're up against.

Id: [0x000FDDC4]
Okay please help me up.

Id: [0x000FDDC5]
Mother sent a warrior to protect me. A philosopher does need a guard.

Id: [0x000FDDC6]
I am not your guard. I am helping your mother.

Id: [0x000FDDC7]
Your badge. The eye of horus?

Id: [0x000FDDC8]
It is my Medjay badge.

Id: [0x000FDDC9]
Medjay? Ahhhhhh. Old Kingdom. Weren't they killed by the Ptolemies?

Id: [0x000FDDCA]
They forgot one.

Id: [0x000FDDDC]
Yes, Benipe can certainly make something for you. Or Senu can help you find what you need.

Id: [0x000FDDDF]
Senu, old girl! In fine form.

Id: [0x000FDDE0]
The people are desperate for your help, Bayek. They'll help you if you help them.

Id: [0x000FDE4A]
Both of the two died, but they showed the people where their treacherous hearts lied!

Id: [0x000FDE54]
Don't think so long. Jump!

Id: [0x000FDE55]
Yes. Papo.

Id: [0x000FDE57]
Trust me. You can.

Id: [0x000FDE58]
I do! I will!

Id: [0x000FDE59]
Jump then!

Id: [0x000FDE5C]
I can do it, papo! I can!

Id: [0x000FDE5E]
Shut up, you filthy, little shit.

Id: [0x000FDE60]
I am indeed Medjay here. Who summons me?

Id: [0x000FDE61]
Sheathe your weapon and follow me.

Id: [0x000FDE62]
Run home to your mother. Chenzira will be fine. I will take care of it.

Id: [0x000FDE64]
Go! Now.

Id: [0x000FDE65]
I'm scared. I don't want to go home alone.

Id: [0x000FDE66]
Khemu, just do what i say, please! Go!

Id: [0x000FDE70]
You could not even save your own son! You are no one. Bayek of nothing. Father to nobody.

Id: [0x000FDE7A]
My son.

Id: [0x000FDE88]
The Great Sphinx. It's smaller than I expected.

Id: [0x000FDE89]
A hidden entrance! How long has this been here?

Id: [0x000FDE9A]
A dead end. It does not make sense. There must be a way forward.

Id: [0x000FDE9E]
Ah! By Amun! What is this?

Id: [0x000FDEA0]
Tell Agrippa I need real soldiers who will help me find these thieves! Now scuttle back to your wine you sacks of uselessness.

Id: [0x000FDEA2]
This is not Egyptian.

Id: [0x000FDEAC]
A Rome with you as king?

Id: [0x000FDEAD]
Let Caesar speak!

Id: [0x000FDEAE]
We want a Rome that offers justice, peace and land to all its citizens, not just the privileged few!

Id: [0x000FDEAF]
You are just as privileged as I?

Id: [0x000FDEB0]
I am not dictator for life!

Id: [0x000FDEB1]
An honor bestowed upon me by the people of Rome. Would you have me refuse such a gift?

Id: [0x000FDEB2]
We would have you think of Rome before yourself.

Id: [0x000FDEB3]
I will unite the Republic. Senatus Populusque Romanus, for the Senate and the people of Rome.

Id: [0x000FDEB4]
Republic? You speak of republic while coveting a crown?

Id: [0x000FDEB5]
Marcus Antonius offered me the crown, at the Lupercalia festival. I refused it.

Id: [0x000FDEB6]
And what a pretty play it was.

Id: [0x000FDEB7]
You don't need a crown, they have made you a god!

Id: [0x000FDEB9]
Mark me Gaius Cassius Longinus, support me in my dreams for Rome and old divisions will be forgotten. Oppose me and Rome will not forgive you.

Id: [0x000FDEBA]
Senators, the war is over.

Id: [0x000FDEBC]
The drums of dissent have reached a fever pitch.

Id: [0x000FDEBD]
Rome will not be a monarchy again.

Id: [0x000FDEBE]
It seems Brutus would start a revolution. But against what my friend? We desire the same things.

Id: [0x000FDEBF]
How can you say that when you have raised yourself so far above the people.

Id: [0x000FDEC0]
I speak for the people!

Id: [0x000FDEC1]
You have seized the rights of the citizenry!

Id: [0x000FDEC2]
No! The people infused with fear and blinded by patriotism, offered up all of their rights to their leader and did it gladly so.

Id: [0x000FDEC3]
Who made you Leader of Rome?

Id: [0x000FDEC4]
The eternal city herself.

Id: [0x000FDEC6]
Caesar will not be reasoned with!

Id: [0x000FDEC7]
Senators, we still have a voice in this forum.

Id: [0x000FDEC9]
I will hear your complaints!

Id: [0x000FDECA]
Caesar deigns to listen, Romans rejoice!

Id: [0x000FDECF]
And here I am, at last, in the Faiyum. I will root out the agents of the Crocodile.

Id: [0x000FDED8]
Where was this?

Id: [0x000FDED9]
All of them, I think.

Id: [0x000FDEDC]
Can you believe how stupid these Greeks are?

Id: [0x000FDEDD]
They wouldn't be able to tell a live cat from a dead one, never mind a dead cat from a straw one!

Id: [0x000FDEDF]
When can we stop making these fake mummies?

Id: [0x000FDEE0]
When the tourists stop buying them!

Id: [0x000FDEE1]
But aren't there faster ways to earn coin?

Id: [0x000FDEE2]
If you come up with one, by all means, let us know.

Id: [0x000FDEE4]
The new batch of holy rubbish is ready for the merchant.

Id: [0x000FDEEA]
Good news!

Id: [0x000FDEEB]
I wonder where he's gotten to? He should have come for the pickup by now.

Id: [0x000FDEEC]
Maybe a camel ate him. [laughs at his own joke]

Id: [0x000FDEF2]
[BIRD CALL]

Id: [0x000FDEF7]
Help yourself. The Romans have no more use for it.

Id: [0x000FDEFB]
Cleopatra, Throne of Power, has healed all sickness, lifted all curses, dispelled all corruption.

Id: [0x000FDEFC]
But she is not the only deity stooping to our aid.

Id: [0x000FDEFD]
Amun, who hides his colors, intercedes and sends his servants among us.

Id: [0x000FDEFE]
Together they walk the shadows, twin blades in the hands of the Hidden God.

Id: [0x000FDEFF]
People of the old city, your deliverance is coming.

Id: [0x000FDF00]
Hail to our King!

Id: [0x000FDF04]
So much for the Ibis.

Id: [0x000FDF05]
Well done, my friend! Our hero returns!

Id: [0x000FDF06]
I should get to Alexandria. I need to see Aya.

Id: [0x000FDF08]
Don't be in too much of a hurry. Siwa will always need its Medjay.

Id: [0x000FDF0B]
I must leave Siwa. There are others to whom I must deliver justice. Especially the one known as the Snake.

Id: [0x000FDF0C]
How will you find these men?

Id: [0x000FDF0D]
Aya has been tracking them in Alexandria. I must find her.

Id: [0x000FDF0E]
She said she would be visiting her cousin at the Great Library.

Id: [0x000FDF0F]
Good-bye my friend.

Id: [0x000FDF1B]
Ghupa. I will get you out.

Id: [0x000FDF1F]
I know the Scarab took your tongue. But we can help each other.

Id: [0x000FDF22]
Harkuf told me that you were investigating the Scarab.

Id: [0x000FDF23]
Help me, and I can ensure he dies.

Id: [0x000FDFA3]
And we know the Scarab strikes in the heart of the sandstorm!

Id: [0x000FDFA4]
The Scarab is just a rumor. Everyone knows that.

Id: [0x000FDFA7]
Are you new here?

Id: [0x000FDFA8]
Yes, I heard the promise of Master Taharqa as far away as Cyrene. I came here to start a new life.

Id: [0x000FDFA9]
Master Taharqa will reward us for our good work.

Id: [0x000FDFD2]
This must have been built centuries upon centuries ago.

Id: [0x000FDFD3]
The riches of the ancients.

Id: [0x000FDFEA]
You heard about the [wab](priest) we caught?

Id: [0x000FDFEB]
The Lady of Slaughter provides.

Id: [0x000FDFEC]
Her pets were getting hungry...

Id: [0x000FDFED]
Good to keep them hungry until after the next raid. Then, if we need, we can bleed him.

Id: [0x000FDFEE]
I hope that is not my job...

Id: [0x000FDFEF]
Everyone has to feed them, once.

Id: [0x000FDFF7]
I must recover my weapons before I can hunt the Scarab.

Id: [0x000FDFFB]
The heat has addled me. I am straying too far.

Id: [0x000FDFFC]
I am tired of your idiot jokes, Mereruka!

Id: [0x000FDFFD]
How are things in Memphis?

Id: [0x000FDFFE]
I must admit… Memphis is under a shadow. The high priest angered the gods, and is cursed to see the doom of the city.

Id: [0x000FE38F]
How long do you think it will take for him to die?

Id: [0x000FE390]
The guy we buried? Hmm. Two days?

Id: [0x000FE391]
He looked tough. I'd bet five drachma he'd survive for at least three.

Id: [0x000FE392]
You're on. Wait. Who is going to check?

Id: [0x000FE397]
O mother Nut, watch over me, so that I may be placed among the stars and never die.

Id: [0x000FE398]
Oh gods, smile upon my work so that my name endures.

Id: [0x000FE39E]
I was in front of you the whole time.

Id: [0x000FE39F]
Your eyes were too weak to see.

Id: [0x000FE3A0]
You are a speck, to be swallowed up by time.

Id: [0x000FE3A1]
No more than a mirage, like yourself.

Id: [0x000FE3A2]
Soon only my true vision will remain.

Id: [0x000FE3AD]
The villagers are drained of life.

Id: [0x000FE3ED]
Ever the critic, thank you Leda.

Id: [0x000FE3EE]
What is life without reality? A death in all but name.

Id: [0x000FE3F0]
Rise up my Egyptians! Do not let them lead us blindly!

Id: [0x000FE3FF]
I have to find Khenut before the soldiers get to her!

Id: [0x000FE405]
Have you seen Khenut? Is she here?

Id: [0x000FE406]
The soldiers just came and took her to the Lighthouse. Young Shadya too! Khenut argued with them but they would not listen.

Id: [0x000FE407]
Something is wrong isn't it? This has never happened before.

Id: [0x000FE409]
Damn all this! Khenut and Shadya are at the Lighthouse! I need to get there now!

Id: [0x000FE412]
Gods! Shadya wrote this. She has the ledger! And I sent her back to her mother!

Id: [0x000FE414]
Nek!... Nek!

Id: [0x000FE415]
Get word to Hotephres. Hurry!

Id: [0x000FE424]
Come, Bayek! Take up your iron and join us!

Id: [0x000FE42A]
Brave, loyal servants of Letopolis! We will root these reavers out of their holes, and spill their blood on the sand!

Id: [0x000FE682]
Aaaahhh!

Id: [0x000FE684]
Father!

Id: [0x000FE685]
I'll cut you down! Like you did my father!

Id: [0x000FE687]
I thought you were our friend! I hate you!

Id: [0x000FE689]
Take care of him. Try to make him understand if you can.

Id: [0x000FE68C]
You have brought blood and death to my house.

Id: [0x000FE68E]
You were blind, but now you must open your eyes. Your husband was the Scarab. He did this.

Id: [0x000FE690]
Your father was tortured and scarred by this man. As were so many others.

Id: [0x000FE691]
No…

Id: [0x000FE692]
It is up to you to raise your boy into the light, out of the blood and shadows of his father's legacy.

Id: [0x000FE694]
I am sorry, my son.

Id: [0x000FE699]
You know, you are perfectly Phanos' type.

Id: [0x000FE69A]
I have no idea what you speak of.

Id: [0x000FE69B]
You are a perfect brooding hero! A grand story, until the Gods smack him down mightily for his temerity!

Id: [0x000FE69C]
That is not helpful.

Id: [0x000FE69E]
Be calm. We will be out of here quickly.

Id: [0x000FE69F]
Of course! I will be as silent as -

Id: [0x000FE6A0]
Be still. I think I hear them.

Id: [0x000FE6A2]
Hide, poet!

Id: [0x000FE6A3]
I will not!

Id: [0x000FE6A8]
You phylakitai have chosen the wrong enemy!

Id: [0x000FE6A9]
Get the foolish traitors!

Id: [0x000FE6AA]
These damned poets will finally learn!

Id: [0x000FE6AD]
There. We have dealt with them.

Id: [0x000FE6AE]
We need to go only a little way more!

Id: [0x000FE6B0]
And you? How did you end up here?

Id: [0x000FE6B1]
I took inspiration from you. Consider me a protector.

Id: [0x000FE6B2]
Of what? There's no one out here.

Id: [0x000FE6B3]
Of the green.

Id: [0x000FE6B6]
But such a tragedy this will be. All will be pushed to tears!

Id: [0x000FE6B7]
Find me when you are ready.

Id: [0x000FE6B8]
[laughs]

Id: [0x000FE6D3]
Come, Bayek. Help me make this right.

Id: [0x000FE6D9]
This is from Siwa. Aya kept it all these years

Id: [0x000FE6DD]
Is she safe?

Id: [0x000FE6DE]
I am sorry my good fellow, you appear to be drunk. This library is for serious scholars only.

Id: [0x000FE6DF]
Who are you?

Id: [0x000FE6E1]
An unfortunate incident, indeed. A man came searching for her and she had no choice.

Id: [0x000FE6E3]
Gennadios sent his men on a house-to-house search. Often they drag people into the street and torture them for information. Typical of the system we live under.

Id: [0x000FE6E4]
A monster. The phylakitai of Alexandria. He is ravaging the city to find her.

Id: [0x000FE6E5]
But what happened? You do not answer me.

Id: [0x000FE6ED]
Go ahead. Aya awaits!

Id: [0x000FE6EF]
It is right there. Down into the den.

Id: [0x000FE6F4]
I have worried about you.

Id: [0x000FE707]
News from Rome, sir.

Id: [0x000FE708]
Speak.

Id: [0x000FE709]
The triumvirate is broken. Pompey and Caesar will almost certainly go to war. Should I have gifts sent to both?

Id: [0x000FE714]
Wait until one emerges as the victor. No point flattering a dead man.

Id: [0x000FE745]
Gennadios spends time in the palace as well as around the docks.

Id: [0x000FE751]
Never again should we spend months apart. We only have each other. Without Khemu...

Id: [0x000FE752]
Ssh. Let us be together, us two, each to each.

Id: [0x000FE755]
You'll find plenty of information in the Royal Scribe's office. He spends his time at the bath house. Go search the palace while he's away.

Id: [0x000FE756]
And you?

Id: [0x000FE797]
Such is the short but luminous life of a gladiator. [spits]

Id: [0x000FE79B]
This is futile. A change of plans. The Lion says we must march on the Pharos, and trap the Queen.

Id: [0x000FE7BF]
The water's a bit tepid today. Such incompetence.

Id: [0x000FE7C1]
Quite. See that my towels are readied.

Id: [0x000FE7C3]
Stop annoying me, if you please. [mutters]Idiot.

Id: [0x000FE7C6]
Something's happened! Check the room! Quickly!<CR><LF>

Id: [0x000FE7D4]
Is everything to your liking, my lord?

Id: [0x000FE7D5]
My lord. Are you properly served?

Id: [0x000FE7D6]
Can I do anything for you, my lord?

Id: [0x000FE7D8]
Sir! Honored Scribe? Are you all right?

Id: [0x000FE80C]
[Ad victoriam!](For victory!)

Id: [0x000FE814]
Sure, I said, I told him, I said, "Your Gennadios do not scare me!" I said. "I've got friends at court!"

Id: [0x000FE824]
Flavius, come. Look, we have found the great King.

Id: [0x000FE828]
Find this woman! She has murdered a friend of the royal court.

Id: [0x000FE838]
At your command, Phylakitai!

Id: [0x000FE83A]
See that workers on the docks are rounded up and questioned. When I say questioned, I mean beaten. They must know something.

Id: [0x000FE83B]
As you wish, Gennadios.

Id: [0x000FE83C]
Offer rewards to informers. But don't trust them. You can never trust informers. In fact, have them flogged once they've told us everything.

Id: [0x000FE83D]
As usual, sir.

Id: [0x000FE840]
Gennadios, sir! A soldier from the house-to-house search has disappeared.

Id: [0x000FE842]
Probably off whoring. Dock his pay.

Id: [0x000FE845]
Papo! You found it. Can I have it back?

Id: [0x000FE889]
Keep the soldiers distracted Caesar, I will handle Pothinus.

Id: [0x000FE88A]
It's been too long, son.

Id: [0x000FE88C]
Khemu, c'm here! I found a hyena cave.

Id: [0x000FE88E]
A real one?

Id: [0x000FE894]
Well, you know what, I'd rather go hunt with my papo.

Id: [0x000FE895]
Let's go on a real hunt, eh?

Id: [0x000FE8F1]
You honor me, Medjay. May Sobek honor you.

Id: [0x000FE8F5]
Ah... Haha! Help! Help! It's Hercules!

Id: [0x000FE8F6]
You are mine, Helen of Troy! You cannot escape me!

Id: [0x000FE8F7]
(Giggling and moaning)<LF>Oh, Hercules, you're so strong!

Id: [0x000FE901]
That has got to be her.

Id: [0x000FE90C]
The bandits will be here again soon, brothers. We'll make our final stand. Give them a few scars before they slit our throats.

Id: [0x000FE90D]
We're with you, Rai. We're all tired of running.

Id: [0x000FE90F]
Sir, this man wears a Medjay badge!

Id: [0x000FE910]
Nah, nah I have already got an Egyptian. A huntress from Siwa who's worth three of you. She frequents the obelisk in the east end if you want an impromptu beating.

Id: [0x000FE91C]
Then find me fighters who can actually fight! [spits]

Id: [0x000FE91D]
Sir, we need more fighters. They're dying at an alarming rate.

Id: [0x000FE92B]
Why are you hiding amongst these ruins?

Id: [0x000FE92C]
A Medjay! The gods show mercy at last!

Id: [0x000FE92D]
My name is Rai, and this is what's left of my family. Bandits chased us from our farms. We have nowhere else to go.

Id: [0x000FE92E]
We have nothing of value, yet they've pursued us for days across this wasteland!

Id: [0x000FE930]
They killed so many. My father, my son. Those here are all who remain of our village. The bandits will come again to finish us. Stand with us, Medjay. Help us get vengeance at least!

Id: [0x000FE931]
Vengeance is my creed. I will help you. Tell me your plan.

Id: [0x000FE93C]
There's the Siwan. Wait. That looks like…

Id: [0x000FE945]
There's a cliff not far from here. From there we'll be able to see the whole area, and plan our defense. Let's go.

Id: [0x000FE946]
This wasteland is perilous. If it's not bandits, it's hyenas, or some other beast. Thank Ra my father taught me how to use a bow.

Id: [0x000FE947]
That is a nice weapon. It has an unusual make.

Id: [0x000FE948]
When my father gave it to me it was taller than me by three hands. Boys teased me without mercy.

Id: [0x000FE949]
Now it's a sadness to me. It only reminds me of him.

Id: [0x000FE94A]
Did you see that, near the entrance? There are markings on the wall.

Id: [0x000FE94B]
I saw. There is a symbol of Horus, but it is changed slightly.

Id: [0x000FE94C]
They look ancient. What is this place?

Id: [0x000FE94D]
Gods, it's beautiful!

Id: [0x000FE94E]
I could stay here for hours…

Id: [0x000FE951]
I left my husband for Flavius. If only he would look my way.

Id: [0x000FE952]
I would die today if only I could get to see the great Flavius' eyes again.

Id: [0x000FE955]
I will drown myself in the pools of your eyes. I will sacrifice myself on the altar of your brow.

Id: [0x000FE95F]
Bayek, Flavius was here.

Id: [0x000FE960]
But that is not the worst of it. Mothers and wives of the Temple are sick and wailing in the streets. Their pleas to see their loved ones unanswered.

Id: [0x000FE961]
No. Can you speak to my friend Crios? He is a water bearer at the temple.

Id: [0x000FE962]
My task is the priestess Melitta. She is overzealous, but I cannot believe she would prey on the sick and dying.

Id: [0x000FE963]
Be wary. I will return here when I've spoken to Crios.

Id: [0x000FE964]
Yes, a manticore devoured them!

Id: [0x000FE965]
A mythical beast stole your sight?

Id: [0x000FE966]
With the face of a woman and the body of a lion.

Id: [0x000FE967]
Quick! Before she returns. Take me to my friend Theramenes at the clinic. He will know what to do.

Id: [0x000FE968]
Madness is your bedfellow. But I can't leave you here to be eaten by beasts.

Id: [0x000FE969]
How is our patient?

Id: [0x000FE96A]
A babbling fool. We'll get no sense from him till I can relieve his pain. Silphium extract will do it.

Id: [0x000FE96B]
Silphium is our weed and because of the Romans it's almost extinct. They process it at the depot north of here.

Id: [0x000FE96C]
Which is heavily guarded I bet?

Id: [0x000FE96D]
You are a marvel. I will bring our friend back to his senses, not that he had that many to begin with.

Id: [0x000FE96F]
I should return this wonder cure to Theramenes.

Id: [0x000FE970]
Let's see what Theramenes can do with these.

Id: [0x000FE971]
There are many wild animals about, do you not have a bow?

Id: [0x000FE972]
A bow against a manticore?

Id: [0x000FE973]
My bow has killed a thousand beasts.

Id: [0x000FE974]
I hope so.

Id: [0x000FE975]
I found him by the road, crying that the Manticore took his eyes.

Id: [0x000FE979]
Okay, enough of the view. We have to plan.

Id: [0x000FE97A]
Wherever the bandits come from, my brothers will be ready for them in the ruins.

Id: [0x000FE97C]
I mean no disrespect Rai, but you are not soldiers. These bandits are killers. Your farmer friends may not walk away from this fight.

Id: [0x000FE97D]
I know, Bayek. I'm scared out of my mind.

Id: [0x000FE97E]
If your family died in your arms, you would understand. I cannot walk away now.

Id: [0x000FE980]
Believe me, I do understand. And I will fight with you. For now I will head back to the others.

Id: [0x000FE983]
Bayek! What… you are no eagle!

Id: [0x000FE984]
Are you alright?! That was crazy, but amazing!

Id: [0x000FE986]
This is the place, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE987]
We have arrived, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE988]
This is it, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE989]
This is the place, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE98A]
You are where you should be, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE98B]
We are here, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE98C]
This is the place, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE98D]
We have arrived, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE98E]
We are here, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE98F]
This is it, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE990]
This is the place, we are here, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE991]
We are here, safe and sound, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FE992]
You should hurry. It's a long way back down the mountain.

Id: [0x000FE998]
Come forth by day, and I will guide you home.

Id: [0x000FE999]
Who're you talking to?

Id: [0x000FE99A]
Bayek's mummy.

Id: [0x000FE99B]
Real chatterbox, that one.

Id: [0x000FE99D]
This messenger was tortured by the bandits.

Id: [0x000FE99E]
Poor Hapti, I should look into this, he could be in trouble.

Id: [0x000FE99F]
Just get rid of the damned thing!

Id: [0x000FE9A3]
The Romans looted the workers. They took Hapti's bracelet. A gift for his beloved Merope.

Id: [0x000FE9A7]
They killed them and them left them here to rot.

Id: [0x000FE9A8]
That is the tattoo of Ank. Poor Hapti... But there's no bracelet on him.

Id: [0x000FE9AA]
I know why you're here, Medjay. He's dead isn't he? Hapti?

Id: [0x000FE9B5]
Go, brother, and deal with these metrokoites.

Id: [0x000FE9B6]
Once they are dealt with, we can send our poets to spread our truth.

Id: [0x000FE9BB]
Hail to our great Pharaoh!

Id: [0x000FE9BC]
Hail to our glorious phylakitai!

Id: [0x000FE9BD]
Hail to Ptolemies! The greatest of rulers!

Id: [0x000FE9BE]
Hail to Serapis who blesses our great Pharaoh!

Id: [0x000FE9BF]
Hail!

Id: [0x000FE9D6]
Do you know what happens when a whelp finds himself at the feet of a god?

Id: [0x000FE9ED]
Death.

Id: [0x000FE9EE]
So, too, will our fake-Pharaoh find fate.

Id: [0x000FE9EF]
Death from the hands of the gods!

Id: [0x000FEAE3]
The Gods unite us Greek and Egyptian alike!

Id: [0x000FEAE4]
Ptolemy is a god and should be revered!

Id: [0x000FEAE6]
I will fill my ink wells with the blood of these metrokoites.

Id: [0x000FEAE7]
Is your vengeance above all law, Medjay? Be warned, the phylakes will hunt you down and exact revenge.

Id: [0x000FEAEB]
Whatever it takes to defend freedom.

Id: [0x000FEAEC]
The Alexandrian Poets await!

Id: [0x000FEAF4]
(laughing) You can. Your arrow will have to become Senu.

Id: [0x000FEAF5]
Yeah.

Id: [0x000FEAF6]
Bayek, you are a Poet of the Kill.

Id: [0x000FEAF7]
Fill the city with your words.

Id: [0x000FEAF9]
One word?

Id: [0x000FEAFA]
What word did your father say?

Id: [0x000FEAFB]
"Jump."

Id: [0x000FEB01]
[Gasping for air]

Id: [0x000FEB15]
Khemu? Are you hurt?

Id: [0x000FEB30]
Ugh.

Id: [0x000FEB31]
[Sighs]

Id: [0x000FEB32]
[Exasperated ono]

Id: [0x000FEB37]
[vomiting sounds]

Id: [0x000FEB38]
[Out of breath]

Id: [0x000FEB39]
[Effort grunts]

Id: [0x000FEB3A]
[Laughing]

Id: [0x000FEB3B]
[Excited grunt]

Id: [0x000FEB3C]
[Heavy breathing and effort grunts]

Id: [0x000FEB3D]
[Heavy breathing and effort grunts]

Id: [0x000FEB3E]
Hmph.

Id: [0x000FEB3F]
[Effort grunts]

Id: [0x000FEB40]
Hmph.

Id: [0x000FEB4D]
We thought you were dead.

Id: [0x000FEB4F]
Hey!

Id: [0x000FEB50]
I'll tell Phanos that Gennadios is dead and meet you later.

Id: [0x000FEB8F]
Someone's piggybacking on our network, and you can guess who that "someone" might be.

Id: [0x000FEB92]
Layla? Your readings… Where do you think you're going? Stay with me!

Id: [0x000FEC58]
Come back, you're not ready.

Id: [0x000FEC5A]
Nice.

Id: [0x000FEC60]
Thank you, sir. Now I'll be able to pay Sefetu's dogs off, this time at least.

Id: [0x000FECC5]
You said you only wanted to talk to him!

Id: [0x000FECC8]
Ow!

Id: [0x000FECCC]
The damned eunuch is no more. Good. The speculatores found Septimius. He is in the village beyond.

Id: [0x000FECCD]
I will distract his men while you capture him. We must know what he plans.

Id: [0x000FECCF]
They have their limits. But they claim Aya has the scent of that puppet King, so they also have their uses.

Id: [0x000FECE1]
Hurry up. Grandmother said a storm was coming. Said she could smell it.

Id: [0x000FECE2]
Her nose is a thing of wonder!

Id: [0x000FECE3]
Imagine: all my arrows are Senus! Then I will be able to hunt anything!

Id: [0x000FECE5]
You said you'd like to see the Pharaoh up close?

Id: [0x000FECE6]
Yeah.

Id: [0x000FECE7]
What if you stand with me by his side?

Id: [0x000FECE8]
Can I do that?

Id: [0x000FECE9]
As my son and the future Medjay, yes.

Id: [0x000FECEA]
Oh, papo! I am so excited to be Medjay one day. You know all the secrets of Siwa.

Id: [0x000FECEC]
Go Ahead, try shooting those dummies.

Id: [0x000FECED]
Hepzefa! Quick hide!

Id: [0x000FECEE]
What's going on?

Id: [0x000FECEF]
Guards! They're on their way!

Id: [0x000FECF0]
Oh nice, good job on the rope tension.

Id: [0x000FECF1]
Yes, I changed it entirely. Try again!

Id: [0x000FECF2]
Nice shot! 

Id: [0x000FECF3]
You did an amazing work my friend!

Id: [0x000FECF4]
Oh that was easy. Come on, shoot again.

Id: [0x000FECF5]
Hey! Don't break my things!

Id: [0x000FECF6]
Sorry!

Id: [0x000FECF7]
My bad!

Id: [0x000FECF8]
Told you to shoot the dummies...not that!

Id: [0x000FECF9]
Bayek...the dummies...

Id: [0x000FECFA]
Yes yes sorry about that.

Id: [0x000FECFB]
Hey! Point that elsewhere!

Id: [0x000FECFC]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x000FECFD]
Bayek...stop messing around.

Id: [0x000FECFE]
Wow, man...don't do that!

Id: [0x000FECFF]
Come on!

Id: [0x000FED00]
Shoot the dummies I said!

Id: [0x000FED01]
Hey! I liked this...damn it!

Id: [0x000FED02]
Sure you know how to aim?

Id: [0x000FED03]
You're kidding me right?

Id: [0x000FED2A]
You make fun, but remember the last storm?

Id: [0x000FED2B]
How could I forget? Those reavers came in like wild animals, raiding and pillaging! Perhaps grandmother can smell them, too.

Id: [0x000FED2C]
Master Taharqa needs to find more fighting men to keep us safe.

Id: [0x000FED54]
Didn't want to be seen, sir. Kept to the shadows.

Id: [0x000FED5E]
What took you so long?

Id: [0x000FED5F]
We are pleased you have joined us, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FED60]
It is of great importance that we gain access to the vault. The temple priests stubbornly refuse to assist us.

Id: [0x000FED62]
You are perhaps reluctant out of loyalty to the Oracle. We have someone to help convince you otherwise.

Id: [0x000FED64]
Bayek! I thought they just wanted to ask him a question!

Id: [0x000FED66]
What have I done?

Id: [0x000FED69]
Quiet!

Id: [0x000FED75]
Your son has something to explain to you. Would the Ibis show him the orb?

Id: [0x000FED76]
Papo. They need you to tell them about the vault. They need to know how to use this.

Id: [0x000FED83]
Which one is the god of fire? Wake him up and tell him its time to unleash his wrath!

Id: [0x000FED85]
Damastes! Bear up!

Id: [0x000FED86]
We have got them nautai!

Id: [0x000FED87]
Ahh! Light them up!

Id: [0x000FED88]
My shield is burned!

Id: [0x000FED89]
Is that all they've got!

Id: [0x000FED8A]
We will burn them like Ra!

Id: [0x000FED8B]
We are at sea, captain. Any greatness here is yours.

Id: [0x000FED8C]
Captain my shield smells like charcoal.

Id: [0x000FED8D]
Those neket iadet will feel Ra's arrows!

Id: [0x000FED8E]
Nice to hear Egyptian vulgarity on a Greek ship. Variety is what makes life interesting. And bloodshed! Alalalalaaaaa!!

Id: [0x000FED8F]
I'll take angry gods over docile ones right now. Open up the skies and rain some kind of shit down on us.

Id: [0x000FED90]
As are we, lucky to be in your furious company.

Id: [0x000FED91]
Alright, this is it. Do not underestimate him. Keep your hands up - you are dropping your right hand when you hook. Let me know when you are ready.

Id: [0x000FED95]
The stone circles show the gods' places in the sky. And your grandfather once told me they also show our place in the world.

Id: [0x000FEDAF]
A sick man. That's an end to his evil. May the gods deal with those who watched his shows.

Id: [0x000FEDB0]
Felix, I've heard some gladiators are chosen for… extra work.

Id: [0x000FEDB2]
You heard wrong. And if there was an arrangement, you would have much more to do to earn your way in. [spits]

Id: [0x000FEDB3]
Your job, you upstart dog nobble, is to fight. That is it. You earn your gold in the pit, or you do not earn it.

Id: [0x000FEDB5]
No! The priestess… a snake in the apple… she has them, she keeps them hidden… lies in whispers… secrets… shrouded. Her shrine of whispers.

Id: [0x000FEDB6]
The mountains… but…

Id: [0x000FEDBD]
Why so secretive, Mouse?

Id: [0x000FEDBF]
I have shenanigans in mind, my friend.

Id: [0x000FEDC0]
The reward is money for you, and an idyllic new life for the Mouse. A farm by the coast where I will raise chickens, goats…

Id: [0x000FEDC5]
The King cried when he killed the white hart. For it was the huntress bewitched, pale and beautiful with a halo of gold.

Id: [0x000FEDC7]
A crown? This must be the halo from the prophecy.

Id: [0x000FEDCF]
What is wrong with your girl, Apate yes?

Id: [0x000FEDD0]
A few months ago she met a Greek lad, he was so earnest and idealistic…

Id: [0x000FEDD1]
There is a place on the road to Cyrene where they inflict the cruelest punishment. A road lined with dead rebels.

Id: [0x000FEDD2]
It's surprising what Roman lips will spill if you ply them with enough wine.

Id: [0x000FEDD5]
Before they dock the Crow drops her contraband into the shallows…

Id: [0x000FEDD9]
I'll wait for you across the docks. Don't get caught, Sir Bayek!

Id: [0x000FEDDA]
How do I let you talk me into these capers, Mouse?

Id: [0x000FEDDB]
My silver tongue and your golden heart.

Id: [0x000FEDDE]
This is what happens to filthy rats who betray the Republic!

Id: [0x000FEDDF]
Stealing silphium is a serious crime, punishable by death.

Id: [0x000FEDE0]
I should cut your tongue out, that'll keep you quiet.

Id: [0x000FEDE1]
You'll scream when we hammer the nails in. They all do.

Id: [0x000FEDE2]
The fight will desert you after two days on the cross.

Id: [0x000FEDE3]
Sir Bayek, you return unscathed!

Id: [0x000FEDE4]
The manifest says the ship arrived from Alexandria with the first tide.

Id: [0x000FEDE6]
Ah, they'll have dropped their illegal imports at the shipwreck east of Apollonia.

Id: [0x000FEDE7]
However, based on the manifest, the Romans cracked the code, they'll be looking too.

Id: [0x000FEDEB]
We will not bow before you, neket iadets. Not in Egypt and not in Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x000FEDEC]
This is the crucifixion site, Apate must be here somewhere.

Id: [0x000FEDED]
Those neket iadets will send reinforcements. We shouldn't linger here, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FEDEE]
This treasure will do more good for the Mouse than the smugglers.

Id: [0x000FEDEF]
I could not stand by as the Roman contagion spread. You heard what they did in Siwa, Bayek?

Id: [0x000FEDF1]
I saw it. You attacked the fort?

Id: [0x000FEDF3]
Then at night he goes who knows where to plot and plan. While Severus lives the rebellion is nothing but sound and fury.

Id: [0x000FEDF4]
Look him in the eyes and make him understand that he's a shit eater. I will gather my friends. If you attack the outpost, we'll join you.

Id: [0x000FEDFF]
I don't know what to do. We can't afford the taxes anymore. I'm afraid Sefetu will jail us or kill us.

Id: [0x000FEE01]
He is similar to you.

Id: [0x000FEE0F]
What does your husband say?

Id: [0x000FEE10]
Don't tell anyone…

Id: [0x000FEE11]
Of course not.

Id: [0x000FEE12]
He had spoken to Jeska about smuggling us out. Like she's done with others.

Id: [0x000FEE13]
Oh no!

Id: [0x000FEE14]
When I heard Sefetu had imprisoned her, my heart broke. Now we have no way out. No idea what to do…

Id: [0x000FEE15]
Be strong. The gods will protect us. Have faith.

Id: [0x000FEE1A]
I just heard!

Id: [0x000FEE1B]
Terrible! I cannot believe Sefetu razed Mefkat to the ground.

Id: [0x000FEE1C]
All of those poor people!

Id: [0x000FEE1D]
He did it to punish those who defied him. Who tried to resist. Like Jeska.

Id: [0x000FEE22]
We need to alert Caesar.

Id: [0x000FEE25]
I don't know nothing about this vault. Please leave my son out of this.

Id: [0x000FEE30]
You have saved my life for a second time, Sir Bayek! I am blessed! Blessed by the gods who brought you to me on this the greatest of days!

Id: [0x000FEE98]
They will kill me if they find me!

Id: [0x000FEE99]
The gods will punish your treachery.

Id: [0x000FEE9A]
I will fight for Rome no longer!

Id: [0x000FEE9C]
Why would the army lock up their own men?

Id: [0x000FEE9E]
They mean to take Egypt…

Id: [0x000FEE9F]
Papo taught me to be a fighter, but he believed in honor and justice.

Id: [0x000FEEA0]
Yes, so I deserted. I will not stay here doing Leander and Flavius' dirty work.

Id: [0x000FEEA1]
Where is the Navarch?

Id: [0x000FEEA2]
On his ship. He patrols the waters between Cyrene and Apollonia. Killing him will throw the fleet into chaos.

Id: [0x000FEEA3]
Go with Iset, Titus. I will deal with the Navarch.

Id: [0x000FEEA5]
This place went unnoticed for a long time.

Id: [0x000FEEA6]
Satellite hardly registers it at all. Its topography makes it pretty much invisible.

Id: [0x000FEEAA]
There's a huge rock formation in the middle of the central chamber. Looks like an hourglass.

Id: [0x000FEEAB]
It's probably holding the cave up. Try not to deploy anything explosive.

Id: [0x000FEEAE]
Why did the Romans capture you?

Id: [0x000FEEAF]
For the knowledge I have… but we should not talk here.

Id: [0x000FEEB7]
Should I be worried?

Id: [0x000FEEB8]
Bayek my friend! We were just talking about you.

Id: [0x000FEEB9]
No, no! Simonides wants me to play myself in a comedy he's written about Leander - The Laudable Triumph of the Luminaries of Cyrene.

Id: [0x000FEEBA]
The Romans won't let us search Leander's office at the Acropolis.

Id: [0x000FEEBC]
They will let me. I will find it.

Id: [0x000FEEBD]
The deed is yours Diocles.

Id: [0x000FEEBE]
The people had lost faith in us magistrates. This will restore a lot of it.

Id: [0x000FEEBF]
You will win hearts and minds Diocles, with actions.

Id: [0x000FEEC2]
She was a healer, she makes me ashamed.

Id: [0x000FEEC3]
Each thinks his own horizon is the limit of the world, but through you we found a greater purpose…

Id: [0x000FEEC4]
And Praxilla and I are to be married.

Id: [0x000FEEC5]
Diocles! I have not said yes yet.

Id: [0x000FEEC6]
If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need. But, now a toast!

Id: [0x000FEEC8]
To Bayek and Cyrene!

Id: [0x000FEEC9]
A secret in the mountains. I pray Praxilla and the others are alright.

Id: [0x000FEECC]
The priestess, she was torturing these people.

Id: [0x000FEED1]
There is terrible evil here, Bayek. I am terrified for the fate of my Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x000FEED7]
I would burn this place to ashes if I could.

Id: [0x000FEEDB]
Your story will be told.

Id: [0x000FEEDD]
We believe we need this to enter the vault.

Id: [0x000FEEDF]
The boy is frightened. [to Khemu]It's all right.

Id: [0x000FEEE8]
But...

Id: [0x000FEEEA]
We must know its secrets, don't you see, Praxilla? It is simply progress. A marriage of science and magic.

Id: [0x000FEEEB]
You are nothing but Flavius' pawn.

Id: [0x000FEEEC]
How unimaginative you are. But why would you understand the will of Gods? This sacred object, it is a thing of wonder and terror.

Id: [0x000FEEF5]
They have the wrong man! I's as innocent as a babe.

Id: [0x000FEEF6]
What trap has the Mouse fallen into now?

Id: [0x000FEEF7]
Stop your mouth or I'll stop it for you.

Id: [0x000FEEF8]
They accused me of murder? Me? I value life above all…

Id: [0x000FEEFE]
Have faith. Stay low and wait for me at the gardens of the temple of Zeus.

Id: [0x000FEEFF]
Go ahead. Try it your way.

Id: [0x000FEF00]
This is a waste of time!

Id: [0x000FEF01]
So this is where he was murdered.

Id: [0x000FEF02]
Something is stuffed down his throat. A note.

Id: [0x000FEF04]
I need to find this actor before this murderer strikes again!

Id: [0x000FEF05]
The murderer left a message. "They will all pay for their crimes." Someone is seeking justice.

Id: [0x000FEF06]
A pin from a dress? Could the murderer be a woman?

Id: [0x000FEF07]
Red hair, but it is horsehair. Maybe from a wig. That is why Sminthos was falsely accused.

Id: [0x000FEF08]
A scattering of beads. Someone broke their necklace, did Paulus Aurelius struggle with a woman?

Id: [0x000FEF09]
This strigil has blood on it, could be the murder weapon.

Id: [0x000FEF0B]
Would anyone kill that beast! Some one do something.

Id: [0x000FEF0C]
Why don't you do it! I won't risk my life on a dead person, we must wait for the guards

Id: [0x000FEF0D]
No No No!

Id: [0x000FEF0E]
No one is coming! We are actors remember, no one cares about us!

Id: [0x000FEF0F]
Metrobius, the murderer's second victim, there's not much left of him.

Id: [0x000FEF19]
Another note, this must be the whorer.

Id: [0x000FEF1A]
"Father you die. You will be quiet now mother?"

Id: [0x000FEF1B]
Hmm, woah. Vesta was not a prostitute but the forgotten son of one.

Id: [0x000FEF1C]
Bayek! Did you find the killer?

Id: [0x000FEF1D]
Yes. The son of a prostitute. When his mother died, terrible grief overtook him. He believed her ka would not let him rest until he found his father.

Id: [0x000FEF1E]
He's dead?

Id: [0x000FEF1F]
I am sorry, Mouse. He could not be reasoned with. I have his letters, the story they tell is a tragic one.

Id: [0x000FEF20]
Poor boy, such sadness.

Id: [0x000FEF24]
Dee! I found some ancient text. Need a translation.

Id: [0x000FEF25]
Upload it to me. So, when are you calling this in to Abstergo?

Id: [0x000FEF28]
There's some interference on the line, didn't catch that last bit.

Id: [0x000FEF29]
Why do I even bother?

Id: [0x000FEF2E]
Bayek will find the evidence.

Id: [0x000FEF2F]
You bloody fools! Will you let that bloated old goat take everything we've worked for?

Id: [0x000FEF30]
How long do we have to wait?

Id: [0x000FEF31]
You will answer to the people, Leander.

Id: [0x000FEF35]
As Medjay, you must have some clue or key or legend that explains its use.

Id: [0x000FEF46]
Wait, neb! An impatient soul is a troubled one.

Id: [0x000FEF47]
There is a shop south of the temple basin where such items may be found.

Id: [0x000FEF49]
Stop, Bayek. Septimius is a Roman. We will deal with him under our laws.

Id: [0x000FEF5E]
The Pharaoh is dead!

Id: [0x000FEFDB]
He killed my son!

Id: [0x000FF022]
It's been months. Look at that beard!

Id: [0x000FF023]
It's been nearly a year, my friend.

Id: [0x000FF070]
Go ahead on in.

Id: [0x000FF071]
Ah, home! Leave your mount, he will not stray far.

Id: [0x000FF074]
Hurry!

Id: [0x000FF075]
We must make haste!

Id: [0x000FF076]
Come, quickly!

Id: [0x000FF077]
Let us go, quickly!

Id: [0x000FF078]
Grab your horse!

Id: [0x000FF079]
Come! We must ride.

Id: [0x000FF07A]
Get in!

Id: [0x000FF07B]
Let us away!

Id: [0x000FF07C]
We must be cautious here.

Id: [0x000FF07D]
We are barred from entering here. Which means we should definitely go in.

Id: [0x000FF07E]
Careful!

Id: [0x000FF07F]
We must be cautious.

Id: [0x000FF080]
Bayek? ... Bayek!?

Id: [0x000FF081]
Where have you gone to?

Id: [0x000FF082]
Let us go.

Id: [0x000FF083]
Quickly now.

Id: [0x000FF084]
Let us move.

Id: [0x000FF085]
Come now, we are in no rush.

Id: [0x000FF086]
Hold, hold. I am not as young as I used to be.

Id: [0x000FF087]
Let us continue.

Id: [0x000FF088]
Onwards and upwards!

Id: [0x000FF089]
Do not stray too far!

Id: [0x000FF08A]
I cannot see you!

Id: [0x000FF08B]
Ha! That dealt with... What were we speaking of?

Id: [0x000FF08C]
They will think twice next time. Now, what was I saying...

Id: [0x000FF08D]
Hrm? What were we speaking of?

Id: [0x000FF08E]
I do not really like being interrupted.

Id: [0x000FF09A]
Hepzefa!

Id: [0x000FF09B]
What is it?

Id: [0x000FF09C]
Soldiers are coming for you!

Id: [0x000FF09E]
Go! Come, quickly.

Id: [0x000FF0A0]
Hepzefa! We're just here to talk.

Id: [0x000FF0A2]
Nomarch Rudjek's been killed. Your friend the Medjay may have been involved! Come out if you wish to clear his name.

Id: [0x000FF0AC]
A new bow?

Id: [0x000FF0AD]
See if you like it.

Id: [0x000FF0B5]
Pretty banged up.

Id: [0x000FF0B6]
What, your sanity?

Id: [0x000FF0B7]
Ha ha. The piece of shit ride Abstergo gave me.

Id: [0x000FF0BC]
No more painkillers left.

Id: [0x000FF0C1]
It is strung well.

Id: [0x000FF0C2]
I pulled it tight. Take another shot.

Id: [0x000FF0C4]
Good shot!

Id: [0x000FF0C5]
I like the bow.

Id: [0x000FF0C6]
Try again.

Id: [0x000FF0C9]
Hey! That belongs to me!

Id: [0x000FF0CB]
Sorry!

Id: [0x000FF0CD]
Didn't mean to do that.

Id: [0x000FF0CF]
Shoot the targets, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FF0D1]
Bayek... the targets...

Id: [0x000FF0D2]
I got carried away.

Id: [0x000FF0D5]
Do not aim at me!

Id: [0x000FF0D7]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x000FF0D9]
You will put my eye out!

Id: [0x000FF0DB]
Could you please not do that?

Id: [0x000FF0DE]
Enough!

Id: [0x000FF0DF]
Are you trying at all?

Id: [0x000FF0E0]
I made that myself.

Id: [0x000FF0E1]
You have forgotten how to aim, old friend.

Id: [0x000FF0E2]
Are you drunk?

Id: [0x000FF0E3]
May their hearts be light.

Id: [0x000FF0E7]
Dee never puts in enough snacks.

Id: [0x000FF0EB]
What was I looking for again?

Id: [0x000FF151]
I want to fight your strongest man!

Id: [0x000FF152]
You may fight many strong man in this arena but sadly our strongest fighter is missing.

Id: [0x000FF153]
What do you meen "missing"? Where is he? 

Id: [0x000FF154]
No one has seen him in a few weeks.

Id: [0x000FF155]
If you want to fight him you'll have to find were he is hiding...but you won't survive the fight so don't botter. 

Id: [0x000FF156]
We soon learned the truth. Actually...

Id: [0x000FF16B]
Look who is coming!

Id: [0x000FF17C]
Bayek! We have heard of the burning of the village of Mefkat. Were you caught up in that?

Id: [0x000FF17D]
I was among the ruins - with Jeska.

Id: [0x000FF17E]
She is alive?

Id: [0x000FF18A]
The arrows are only making him angrier!

Id: [0x000FF18B]
Hold the chariot steady!

Id: [0x000FF18C]
My focus is on not being trampled, Egyptian.

Id: [0x000FF190]
The lighthouse approaches quickly. We'll run out of land soon.

Id: [0x000FF197]
The children never tire of hiding! I hope they have not gone far.

Id: [0x000FF1A5]
I'll tell Menehet that the children are safe.

Id: [0x000FF1A9]
Yamu… home to my old friend Menehet. He will be in the temple. He always is.

Id: [0x000FF1AC]
All right, Serapis. Now what? Where's Aya?

Id: [0x000FF1AE]
Ah, Serapis. I wrote a tragi-comic-pastoral-epic centered on him.

Id: [0x000FF1AF]
Hey, would you know where they store the God's food?

Id: [0x000FF1B0]
They blocked the entrance to the granary recently

Id: [0x000FF1B1]
There must be a way else inside

Id: [0x000FF1B4]
Despite the fact that the ruling pharaoh is given to arbitrary and despotic decrees, here at the library we support free study! Any topic you like!

Id: [0x000FF1E0]
Bayek my friend, any luck?

Id: [0x000FF1E3]
Did you find my dioptra? We can't finish the aqueduct without it.

Id: [0x000FF1E6]
I know my people are innocent.

Id: [0x000FF1EA]
I told them Romans I heard something in the caves. They said it must be wolves but wolves do not steal tools and piss in the water source.

Id: [0x000FF1EB]
Dedi is terrified! He was the last one to have the master's dioptra.

Id: [0x000FF1EC]
General Agrippa will not be happy until we are all flogged, or worse!

Id: [0x000FF1ED]
Vitruvius has been nothing but kind. Who would steal from him? Not one of us!

Id: [0x000FF1FC]
Where is your mount?

Id: [0x000FF219]
Part of the missing surveying tool.

Id: [0x000FF21A]
Another piece of the tool.

Id: [0x000FF21C]
I should return to Vitruvius, before the Romans make an example of Dedi.

Id: [0x000FF224]
I need to get to solid ground.

Id: [0x000FF22A]
Apep will tear the Duat apart.

Id: [0x000FF22F]
You will feel the sun god's wrath.

Id: [0x000FF233]
What is this gods forsaken place?

Id: [0x000FF234]
I must keep moving or be swallowed by the desert.

Id: [0x000FF237]
Is someone there?

Id: [0x000FF238]
I should head towards those braziers.

Id: [0x000FF23B]
So Apep can be hurt!

Id: [0x000FF23E]
He is weakening!

Id: [0x000FF241]
Hurts doesn't it!

Id: [0x000FF244]
I take the bow, I sweep the sky with it.

Id: [0x000FF247]
I will destroy you!

Id: [0x000FF24A]
Arg! Nek! Poison.

Id: [0x000FF24F]
Ra protect me!

Id: [0x000FF255]
Father!

Id: [0x000FF256]
[Laugh]

Id: [0x000FF257]
Will you teach me to hunt?

Id: [0x000FF258]
I shall pin a scorpion with my bow!

Id: [0x000FF25C]
Yes. And eager to work against Sefetu. I have seen enough to know that he deserves no mercy.

Id: [0x000FF260]
Come, we'll take a boat for speed.

Id: [0x000FF261]
Have you spoken to the High Priest?

Id: [0x000FF262]
Yes, in advance of the Queen's arrival.

Id: [0x000FF263]
She's coming to Memphis?

Id: [0x000FF264]
Yes.

Id: [0x000FF265]
The exiled ruler appears in the heart of Old Egypt. That will set the young Ptolemy on notice.

Id: [0x000FF267]
Excellent. I will find you when we are ready.

Id: [0x000FF26A]
Here we are. Will you drive?

Id: [0x000FF26B]
So, how does it feel to be Medjay to the whole of Egypt?

Id: [0x000FF26C]
Like trailing after an ant colony, sometimes. But I'm proud to serve those in need.

Id: [0x000FF26E]
So you would rather swim with crocodiles than ride with me. Should I be pleased or insulted?

Id: [0x000FF276]
You are the protector here. I'm always pleased to help.

Id: [0x000FF277]
Come see me when you're certain you're ready to go. We'll drink a beer to our friendship!

Id: [0x000FF279]
What do you think is over there?

Id: [0x000FF27A]
Huh? What is that?

Id: [0x000FF27B]
Told you, I saw some ruins on the other side of the Nile when I was last on the river.

Id: [0x000FF27C]
Probably a part of the old city. Lost long ago.

Id: [0x000FF27D]
I wonder if it was a temple. To one of the gods of the old city. Full of wonders.

Id: [0x000FF27E]
Full of hippo shit, more likely. Their gods did not protect them from being swallowed up by the land, did they?

Id: [0x000FF283]
I wonder if olive trees would grow here.

Id: [0x000FF284]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x000FF285]
Could be a great business. Plant an orchard across the river. Press the oil. Sell it up and down the Nile.

Id: [0x000FF286]
Just like the olive trees back in Cyrene.

Id: [0x000FF287]
This is not Cyrene. Not everything from there is better. I like my sesame oil better.

Id: [0x000FF2D0]
Blocked.

Id: [0x000FF2D1]
I'll have to find another way inside.

Id: [0x000FF2D6]
I should search the place where the god's food is stored.

Id: [0x000FF2D9]
Peach pits. If the Apis Bull was fed with these, that would explain his sickness.

Id: [0x000FF2DF]
And the necklace here… One of the Twin Priestesses wore something like it.

Id: [0x000FF2E0]
Let us see if the other is missing a weight from around her neck.

Id: [0x000FF2E1]
I was just asking.

Id: [0x000FF2E2]
Ask my foot next time.

Id: [0x000FF2E3]
Besides, the area you are talking about? It's… not safe. Cursed, maybe.

Id: [0x000FF2E4]
My sister was gathering herbs near there last month and told me she heard weird singing in the middle of the night.

Id: [0x000FF2E7]
Are you a Medjay?

Id: [0x000FF2E8]
Yes, I am.

Id: [0x000FF2E9]
My father took me to the stone circle across the river. We watched the stars come out. A black cloak speckled with gold dust.

Id: [0x000FF2EA]
We watched the map of the heavens, and he told me to whisper my dreams to Lady Serqet.

Id: [0x000FF2EB]
What do you dream of?

Id: [0x000FF2EC]
I dreamed I would like to be a Medjay one day, like you.

Id: [0x000FF2ED]
Anything is possible in this world, if the gods will it.

Id: [0x000FF2EE]
Yohoho and a botile of rum

Id: [0x000FF2F2]
You look like a traveler.

Id: [0x000FF2F3]
I have seen some of the world.

Id: [0x000FF2F4]
Have you been to the ruins of the old temple across the river? I'm sure it holds lost wonders.

Id: [0x000FF2F5]
Is that so?

Id: [0x000FF2F6]
If I was braver, I would cross the river and see for myself. But I have too much to do here.

Id: [0x000FF2F7]
One day, perhaps, you will fulfill your curiosity.

Id: [0x000FF2FB]
As I thought. One priestess is missing her necklace.

Id: [0x000FF2FC]
Herakleion.

Id: [0x000FF2FE]
Apparently Cleopatra is holed up in the palace.

Id: [0x000FF2FF]
I heard she wishes to change the name of our temple, from Amun to Iset.

Id: [0x000FF300]
She is cowering, hiding from the Gabinianis and her brother's men.

Id: [0x000FF301]
We should go visit her. I adore her. She is the goddess!

Id: [0x000FF304]
He is a neket iadet! I won't hold my tongue for that monster! Everyone is scared of him but you should kill him! He's staying at the top of the square.

Id: [0x000FF305]
He won't be staying anywhere, ever again.

Id: [0x000FF30A]
Hey! Do you feed the Apis Bull?

Id: [0x000FF30B]
No. Them girl priestesses take care of all that.

Id: [0x000FF30C]
Do you know where his fodder is kept?

Id: [0x000FF30D]
In that building over by the stairs.

Id: [0x000FF30E]
My thanks.

Id: [0x000FF312]
Peace, nebet. What are you doing out here?

Id: [0x000FF313]
Gathering herbs for the healer of Letopolis.

Id: [0x000FF314]
Is it safe here?

Id: [0x000FF315]
Nothing in this world is safe, friend. The city is plagued by sandstorms and snakes. Am I more at risk in the wild?

Id: [0x000FF316]
Hah. You speak truly.

Id: [0x000FF317]
However… while I don't know where you are going, be careful of the ruins.

Id: [0x000FF318]
Oh? Why is that?

Id: [0x000FF31B]
Infinite scum. Such is the world we live in.

Id: [0x000FF320]
I went too close, once, and found an opening that led beneath the ground. I was curious, but then I heard a weird, otherworldly singing. Like a demon!

Id: [0x000FF321]
Don't laugh. I do not know what it was and I don't want to ever find out.

Id: [0x000FF322]
Where was this?

Id: [0x000FF323]
I don't remember. And if the gods are good, I'll never see it again. Nor you!

Id: [0x000FF327]
Good warrior! Take pity on me!

Id: [0x000FF329]
Don't leave me here with these repulsive bandits!

Id: [0x000FF32B]
A savior! A savior appears!

Id: [0x000FF346]
Father told me there were no Medjay left. Are you a dream?

Id: [0x000FF347]
No, not a dream. But… I am the last Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF348]
He who prepares it poisons your womb with flesh of the dead.

Id: [0x000FF34D]
I have nothing left to throw!

Id: [0x000FF358]
Hurry on now!

Id: [0x000FF359]
Let us move. I cannot be late.

Id: [0x000FF35A]
Ugh. No need to be so slow.

Id: [0x000FF35B]
Let us go.

Id: [0x000FF35C]
Get on your horse, bodyguard!

Id: [0x000FF35D]
Pegasus and I will not wait for you.

Id: [0x000FF35E]
Get on!

Id: [0x000FF35F]
Climb on!

Id: [0x000FF360]
We should not be here, bodyguard.

Id: [0x000FF361]
This is absolutely not where we are supposed to be.

Id: [0x000FF362]
Ah! What is that?

Id: [0x000FF363]
Help, bodyguard!

Id: [0x000FF364]
Bodyguard! Come back! You're too far away!

Id: [0x000FF365]
Bodyguard where are you going?

Id: [0x000FF366]
Come, we must hurry.

Id: [0x000FF367]
Let us go.

Id: [0x000FF368]
This is no time to be a sluggard!

Id: [0x000FF369]
Whoa, no need to be so speedy.

Id: [0x000FF36A]
Slow down, bodyguard!

Id: [0x000FF36B]
Let's hurry on.

Id: [0x000FF36C]
Keep up, bodyguard!

Id: [0x000FF36D]
Where do you think you're going, bodyguard?

Id: [0x000FF36E]
Bodyguard, you stray too far!

Id: [0x000FF36F]
Now... What was I saying?

Id: [0x000FF370]
Never let that happen again!

Id: [0x000FF371]
Ugh. Well, then. What was I saying?

Id: [0x000FF372]
Careful. Oh, yes, I was saying something important, obviously.

Id: [0x000FF37B]
Wake up! Where is Flavius? Where is he?!

Id: [0x000FF37C]
Fly away home, crow!

Id: [0x000FF38F]
We must hurry, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF390]
Come! We must move quickly.

Id: [0x000FF391]
Serapis guides us. Quickly now.

Id: [0x000FF392]
Quick!

Id: [0x000FF393]
To your horse!

Id: [0x000FF394]
On your horse, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF395]
Join me.

Id: [0x000FF396]
Get in.

Id: [0x000FF397]
We are not supposed to be here, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF398]
We should leave here.

Id: [0x000FF399]
Careful, Medjay!

Id: [0x000FF39A]
We must be cautious, Medjay!

Id: [0x000FF39B]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x000FF39C]
Come back, Medjay!

Id: [0x000FF39D]
Medjay. Quickly.

Id: [0x000FF39E]
Let us move quickly, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF39F]
Quick!

Id: [0x000FF3A0]
You go too quickly!

Id: [0x000FF3A1]
Medjay, slow down!

Id: [0x000FF3A2]
Let us continue, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF3A3]
Let's keep going.

Id: [0x000FF3A4]
You go too far, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF3A5]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x000FF3A6]
Thank Serapis. Now, what were we saying...

Id: [0x000FF3A7]
Thank Serapis. What were we saying…

Id: [0x000FF3A8]
Where were we?

Id: [0x000FF3A9]
Let us continue.

Id: [0x000FF3AA]
Tell me about your kidnapping.

Id: [0x000FF3AB]
Best not to speak of it out in the open.

Id: [0x000FF3AC]
But they shut it up last week when the bull got sick.

Id: [0x000FF3B0]
The bull's sickness could come from his food, but it is too soon to say.

Id: [0x000FF3B3]
Resume normal duties, men. I'm off to search the docks for the murderess.

Id: [0x000FF3B6]
Continue searching. I'll report in at the palace.

Id: [0x000FF3BE]
Food for the bull. The rest is likely stored inside this shed.

Id: [0x000FF3C7]
Esteemed Ibis. The pharaoh remains compliant and is our puppet in all things.

Id: [0x000FF3CF]
Stamped with the seal of The Snake.

Id: [0x000FF3D1]
My lords! The pharaoh has been roused! He insists on coming here!

Id: [0x000FF3D2]
We will be discovered!

Id: [0x000FF3D3]
Quickly!

Id: [0x000FF3D4]
See that no one comes in.

Id: [0x000FF3E3]
All writings are to be copied by the Great Library!

Id: [0x000FF3E6]
I wrote this!

Id: [0x000FF3E8]
You can't have it!

Id: [0x000FF3E9]
I guess the works of Archimedes, Plato, Sappho and Aristotle won't have your scribblings to keep them company.

Id: [0x000FF3EA]
Those are all in there?

Id: [0x000FF3EB]
They are.

Id: [0x000FF3EC]
I guess you can copy this, then.

Id: [0x000FF3ED]
Too late, don't want it.

Id: [0x000FF3EE]
Go ahead, take it.

Id: [0x000FF3EF]
No!

Id: [0x000FF3F2]
And Bayek. Do something about that beard.

Id: [0x000FF3F3]
Are you going to go to your house?

Id: [0x000FF3F4]
Nothing there for me.

Id: [0x000FF3FA]
I have no interest in rest.

Id: [0x000FF3FC]
I must prepare for this man.

Id: [0x000FF3FE]
Hepzefa? Hepzefa! Once again, the soldiers -

Id: [0x000FF400]
Bayek?

Id: [0x000FF401]
Rabiah, my Rabiah.

Id: [0x000FF412]
Nek!...they will find my letters and burn down my place, I will be executed.

Id: [0x000FF413]
Don't worry. I will take care of this.

Id: [0x000FF41A]
Prepare an ambush.

Id: [0x000FF420]
Are you here? We just want to talk.

Id: [0x000FF422]
Hepzefa! There's nothing to fear.

Id: [0x000FF424]
Just a few questions!

Id: [0x000FF426]
Tell me about the Ibis.

Id: [0x000FF427]
Medunamun.

Id: [0x000FF428]
Is he here?

Id: [0x000FF429]
He is a plague on the oasis. As you can see, the soldiers have become more brutal since he arrived.

Id: [0x000FF42A]
All the more reason to kill him.

Id: [0x000FF42B]
Do not take him lightly. He is lean and sinewy, but very powerful.

Id: [0x000FF42C]
(humming to herself) Hmm. These deteriorated much faster than previous test subjects.

Id: [0x000FF42D]
Dilated pupils. Vomiting. Could it be the higher dosage of hemlock? Or hellebore? Both? Ha-ha. Of course it's both! Hmm. That's probably painful. I could mix in some mandrake to dull the pain…

Id: [0x000FF42E]
I need to speak to the commander. I've run out of test subjects. There are a lot of combinations to test yet.

Id: [0x000FF462]
That young woman is standing right on the edge of the cliff. I should check on her.

Id: [0x000FF480]
I heard another merchant failed to pay Sefetu.

Id: [0x000FF481]
What happened?

Id: [0x000FF482]
The Firebrand had his soldiers burn the man's ship and all his goods. Told him if he failed to pay again, next time it would be his flesh that would burn.

Id: [0x000FF483]
That son of a…

Id: [0x000FF484]
Not too loud! You do not know who is listening.

Id: [0x000FF48A]
Where did you hear that?

Id: [0x000FF48B]
Some of the guards.

Id: [0x000FF492]
Then Ptolemy is already caught. I will finish the rest.

Id: [0x000FF494]
My palace is at your disposition Gaius.

Id: [0x000FF495]
Pompey was bound to be killed sooner or later.

Id: [0x000FF496]
He was my friend first. But you are right, Ptolemy, now let us discuss our alliance -- What is this?

Id: [0x000FF49B]
You'd think your spies would already know.

Id: [0x000FF4B9]
Besides, my wounds are making me very tired.

Id: [0x000FF4BB]
The Queen is about to speak. Let's go and listen.

Id: [0x000FF4BC]
And so you go to kill again.

Id: [0x000FF4BD]
Make certain no one gets out of the house alive.

Id: [0x000FF4C8]
And what did they say?

Id: [0x000FF4C9]
That they passed a field of victims buried in the desert.

Id: [0x000FF4CA]
Who did it?

Id: [0x000FF4CB]
No one knows. Maybe the Scarab.

Id: [0x000FF4CE]
Is it true? Did Sefetu burn your sister's farm?

Id: [0x000FF4CF]
Yes! He has no mercy!

Id: [0x000FF4D4]
Together we can do more than Alexander did.

Id: [0x000FF4D8]
A madman is loose in the temple!

Id: [0x000FF4DA]
Murder! Murder in the house of Ptah!

Id: [0x000FF4DC]
Away with you, killer!

Id: [0x000FF4DE]
Anubis guard your faithful servants!

Id: [0x000FF4E0]
Then they said…they left for…

Id: [0x000FF4E1]
Where? Where!

Id: [0x000FF4E5]
Vultures devour your liver!

Id: [0x000FF4E7]
Lay hands on me, and your ka will burn!

Id: [0x000FF4E9]
Anubis guards his chosen!

Id: [0x000FF4EA]
What about your sister and her family?

Id: [0x000FF4EB]
They escaped, thank the gods. Jeska helped them out of town, past the guards at Camp Pyrrhos.

Id: [0x000FF4EC]
This situation is impossible!

Id: [0x000FF4ED]
Someone must do something! How can Pharaoh Ptolemy let the abuse continue?

Id: [0x000FF4EE]
Strike true, Medjay of the Queen.

Id: [0x000FF4F0]
I have no counsel to offer you. You are the expert in dealing death.

Id: [0x000FF4F2]
What are you waiting for? Each breath allowed to that priest is an insult to me.

Id: [0x000FF4F4]
Good of you to come back.

Id: [0x000FF4F6]
I missed you.

Id: [0x000FF4FA]
Master Taharqa's wife is so kind. I cannot thank the gods enough for delivering her to us.

Id: [0x000FF4FB]
I have heard that about Lady Maharet.

Id: [0x000FF4FC]
It's true. She heard our business was suffering, and bought a full cart of cloth for her new home.

Id: [0x000FF4FD]
Are they moving to Letopolis?

Id: [0x000FF4FE]
Yes. That is where he works all the time. I only hope they don't forget those of us who still live here.

Id: [0x000FF502]
Thank you for taking this duty on yourself, my love.

Id: [0x000FF504]
I walk on your water.

Id: [0x000FF506]
Someday, I will tell you the words I speak before taking a life.

Id: [0x000FF50C]
Put this into the brazier of the Pharos. She will accompany me through the city.

Id: [0x000FF510]
Pasherenptah should know of this.

Id: [0x000FF511]
He waits at the palace. I have horses for us nearby.

Id: [0x000FF512]
Quickly, follow me.

Id: [0x000FF519]
And why do you want to work here?

Id: [0x000FF51A]
Even as far as Cyrene I heard about the Brewery of Sais, and the recipe that Master Harkuf has crafted.

Id: [0x000FF524]
Yes, his father built it, and he keeps it successful.

Id: [0x000FF525]
Everyone speaks so highly of him!

Id: [0x000FF526]
He is a great man. If anything were to happen to him, many in this area would suffer.

Id: [0x000FF537]
There! It's the fleet!

Id: [0x000FF542]
Look! There's Phanos! He thinks he's a poet!

Id: [0x000FF544]
The modern Sophocles!

Id: [0x000FF545]
You must hear his epic poem, "Ode to a Nanny-Goat!"

Id: [0x000FF549]
Is there any news about Jeska?

Id: [0x000FF54A]
Nothing since that demon's soldiers arrested her. None escape the Firebrand's fort alive.

Id: [0x000FF54E]
(laughs) "...in Heat!"

Id: [0x000FF54F]
(raucous laugh)

Id: [0x000FF556]
Where are you going? We'll miss the Queen's speech!

Id: [0x000FF55A]
Senu's eyes can find the priests… but even she cannot tell me which one is Hetepi.

Id: [0x000FF55C]
The Sister Goddesses exalt you, Medjay.

Id: [0x000FF55E]
They say the Temple of Hathor is haunted. Be careful!

Id: [0x000FF568]
You have kept my lotus safe. I will forever be grateful to you.

Id: [0x000FF56C]
By your death, the curses of Memphis are lifted.

Id: [0x000FF5F9]
You could find the scorpion that killed him, and kill it.

Id: [0x000FF5FA]
Are you mocking me or trying to be cruel?

Id: [0x000FF5FB]
There is no way to make you feel better. There is only tomorrow. And then the next day. One moment at a time.

Id: [0x000FF5FC]
What you say is true. I just don't think I can face it.

Id: [0x000FF5FD]
I want to show you something. I'll return soon. Try not to jump.

Id: [0x000FF608]
I am Bayek, from Siwa. What are you doing in Soknopaiou Nesos?

Id: [0x000FF609]
Few fathers would turn away the child they thought they had lost.

Id: [0x000FF610]
Help me Medjay.... for the good of Egypt.

Id: [0x000FF617]
Thank you, Bayek. I will keep this feather, and weigh it against my heart.

Id: [0x000FF61A]
Roma is no friend to our people of the Nile, she will crush us beneath her sandal. How did you know of me, Medjay?

Id: [0x000FF61B]
The centurion's list led me to you, and another of your comrades at the fort.

Id: [0x000FF61C]
Apollodorus will want to know that we are compromised, and a Roman invasion of the black lands inevitable. Thank you, Medjay. For Egypt.

Id: [0x000FF61D]
For a free Egypt. May our victories multiply.

Id: [0x000FF62A]
You can have it!

Id: [0x000FF62C]
It's not fair! She was going to help us get out of Sais!

Id: [0x000FF62D]
Nothing is fair. We must pray the gods lift Cleopatra to her rightful place, to bring us out of fear and pain.

Id: [0x000FF62F]
Right there. Have a little faith.

Id: [0x000FF639]
They are going to risk the trip?

Id: [0x000FF649]
I heard Nofure say they were packing up to move to Letopolis.

Id: [0x000FF64A]
So she said. Their farm is failing, so they see it as a new start.

Id: [0x000FF64B]
It sounds like a lot of work. To restore and rebuild a whole city.

Id: [0x000FF64C]
Yes, but they say it is a promise of a new life.

Id: [0x000FF65F]
Hm... A false bottom.

Id: [0x000FF661]
A letter.

Id: [0x000FF662]
The Snake is Eudoros, the Royal Scribe.

Id: [0x000FF663]
If you believe them.

Id: [0x000FF667]
I'm looking for the harbor master.

Id: [0x000FF668]
Why?

Id: [0x000FF669]
I've a ship coming in soon with many jars of olive oil and castor oil.

Id: [0x000FF66A]
Hm. That would be a benefit to many here. There is a shortage.

Id: [0x000FF66B]
I know. I'm hoping Zervos can help me bring it in safely, so it doesn't end up in the hands of the tax collectors.

Id: [0x000FF66C]
Things are dangerous for him now. No one knows where he is. But if I see him, I'll tell him about you.

Id: [0x000FF66F]
Every [shoua sekhety](poor peasant) around here thinks they deserve a handout…

Id: [0x000FF673]
You did it! I knew you could do it.

Id: [0x000FF675]
Come here! I have to tell you something.

Id: [0x000FF677]
I know I made fun of you before, but you don't need to ignore me.

Id: [0x000FF67F]
The mistress says she'll pay my trip to Alexandria if I stay a bit longer.

Id: [0x000FF683]
I love it here. Herakleion? So many beauteous Egyptians. And Greeks. I can't tell the difference.

Id: [0x000FF684]
Nek. Tourists everywhere.

Id: [0x000FF697]
Make yourself comfortable upstairs, the twins will come for you.

Id: [0x000FF69B]
I need to talk to that child.

Id: [0x000FF69C]
(whistling) Cleopatra…

Id: [0x000FF69E]
Yes, I am looking for the other musicians, have you seen them?

Id: [0x000FF6A4]
Why would the guard carry this key? It must unlock something important.

Id: [0x000FF6A7]
This must be the key to Kawit's cell.

Id: [0x000FF6AE]
Make a sound and you're dead.

Id: [0x000FF6B0]
Well, I'll wait for Nofure to get settled and write us with news. Then we will see.

Id: [0x000FF6B3]
Did you hear? Did you hear the news?

Id: [0x000FF6B4]
What has got you jumping?

Id: [0x000FF6E3]
Papo.

Id: [0x000FF6E5]
I can get it to you.

Id: [0x000FF6E6]
No. Khemu don't.

Id: [0x000FF6E7]
They're going to hurt us.

Id: [0x000FF6E8]
Khemu they'll... Khemu.

Id: [0x000FF6EC]
This foolish waste of time!

Id: [0x000FF6EE]
No Khemu, Khemu. No, come, come, come, come, come.

Id: [0x000FF6F2]
Out of time! [With his sword at Khemu's chest]Tell us!

Id: [0x000FF6F3]
I don't know!

Id: [0x000FF6F4]
We must go now!

Id: [0x000FF6F5]
I will cut the heart from the boy.

Id: [0x000FF6F7]
He will never know the afterlife.

Id: [0x000FF6F8]
Papo?

Id: [0x000FF6FA]
What's this?

Id: [0x000FF6FC]
The Snake takes that as your answer.

Id: [0x000FF6FE]
No! No! Khemu! Khemu... no, no, no.

Id: [0x000FF6FF]
This is madness!

Id: [0x000FF700]
Stop!

Id: [0x000FF702]
Shut up!

Id: [0x000FF70A]
Master Taharqa was murdered!

Id: [0x000FF70B]
What? Where?

Id: [0x000FF70C]
In Letopolis! They say he was hunted down by a rogue phylake!

Id: [0x000FF714]
I need more evidence.

Id: [0x000FF71E]
Did you hear the news?

Id: [0x000FF71F]
What's that?

Id: [0x000FF723]
The Firebrand is no more!

Id: [0x000FF724]
Is it true?

Id: [0x000FF725]
Yes! Jeska and Harkuf helped an outsider - a nomadic warrior from the country - trap Sefetu and kill him!

Id: [0x000FF726]
A day blessed by the gods!

Id: [0x000FF733]
I still cannot believe it! Master Taharqa! Cut down like a rabid cur! The gods will curse us!

Id: [0x000FF734]
Sew up your mouth! Do not call down their attention on us!

Id: [0x000FF735]
But what will we do now?

Id: [0x000FF736]
I have put too much sweat and blood into restoring my house. We will stay here, and you should do the same.

Id: [0x000FF737]
No… I am afraid the desert will swallow us whole, without Master Taharqa to protect us. We will run before the wind!

Id: [0x000FF738]
How terrible! What of the family?

Id: [0x000FF739]
I heard they returned to their estate, and shut themselves inside in mourning.

Id: [0x000FF73A]
Lady Maharet's wrath could call down a curse worthy of the gods.

Id: [0x000FF73B]
But I imagine Old Ghupa will take over the family interests until their boy comes of age.

Id: [0x000FF73D]
Hustlers! Entrepreneurs! Wanderers! Seek not your solace here, but let your feet carry you to fabled Letopolis.

Id: [0x000FF73E]
Letopolis is a dream given form - a new home for you - built by your hands and labors.

Id: [0x000FF73F]
It is not without its dangers, but the promise of a glorious tomorrow awaits you!

Id: [0x000FF740]
It is a shining lighthouse of hope, all alone in the desert night.

Id: [0x000FF747]
How goes your work?

Id: [0x000FF748]
I have more tasks to do than hours in the day. If it is not Ramessu asking me for something, it's Chief Nito.

Id: [0x000FF749]
No one said Taharqa's promise would be easy to realize.

Id: [0x000FF74A]
No, of course not. I just wish it could be easier.

Id: [0x000FF760]
Your name, Khemu, means Egypt.

Id: [0x000FF762]
Like Egypt, you have forever changed.

Id: [0x000FF791]
I don't know what to say.

Id: [0x000FF792]
Tell me of your husband.

Id: [0x000FF799]
Medjay! You've returned!

Id: [0x000FF79A]
Yes. Your sister is staying on the cliff. She will signal when the bandits approach.

Id: [0x000FF79B]
These ruins are narrow. It could be worthwhile setting traps. Fire and oil, perhaps… do you have supplies?

Id: [0x000FF79C]
Fire, a fine idea. Yes, we do. They're nearby.

Id: [0x000FF79D]
Good. Head up to that roof and keep watch. I will join you soon.

Id: [0x000FF7BD]
Okay, I'll look into this curse.

Id: [0x000FF7C8]
I could use the oil jars to set traps for the bandits. Either way, I should speak to Rai's brother again when I am ready.

Id: [0x000FF7C9]
I am ready.

Id: [0x000FF7CA]
Then we wait… and pray.

Id: [0x000FF7CF]
There they are! The bandits are here!

Id: [0x000FF7D2]
We see you, little mice. Think you can hide from us?

Id: [0x000FF7D3]
Where's the woman! Hand over the bow. Maybe we'll let you live. Or maybe not! Haha!

Id: [0x000FF7DB]
And you will have them.

Id: [0x000FF7DD]
I'm going to find every stone circle. The Sphinx and pyramids too. And I'll find my place.

Id: [0x000FF7DE]
Hit them hard!

Id: [0x000FF7E1]
Go, Medjay! Get them!

Id: [0x000FF7E5]
Punch them in the teeth!

Id: [0x000FF7F1]
Official papers. This chest belongs to the Royal Scribe himself, Eudoros.

Id: [0x000FF7F2]
Pray to the gods in one hand, and spit in the other. See which fills up first.

Id: [0x000FF801]
Well, that was an ugly job.

Id: [0x000FF802]
I hate killing in front of kids.

Id: [0x000FF803]
We told them to leave. Not our fault they wouldn't.

Id: [0x000FF804]
It's not our fault we got bad orders from Mistress Gaia, either!

Id: [0x000FF807]
Did you see that girl in the basement? Hisses like a wildcat, but I would too, in her place.

Id: [0x000FF817]
Mama, are you sure there are no ghosts?

Id: [0x000FF823]
Anytime Bayek!

Id: [0x000FF829]
Hush girl.

Id: [0x000FF82A]
But papa said he heard them when he was coming home the other night.

Id: [0x000FF82B]
Your father had too much of the Sais beer. Drank it all up. [Hmph!] He just heard fishermen on the river. Voices carry on the water.

Id: [0x000FF82C]
And the moon makes them sound strange.

Id: [0x000FF82D]
But mama…

Id: [0x000FF831]
But have you seen it?

Id: [0x000FF832]
The temple ruins?

Id: [0x000FF833]
Yes. I only glimpsed them from the shore.

Id: [0x000FF834]
What about them?

Id: [0x000FF835]
Do you know if the city will rebuild them?

Id: [0x000FF836]
Perhaps, once Letopolis expands enough. For now we have enough to worry about here, reclaiming buildings from the desert.

Id: [0x000FF837]
Aren't you curious about the old gods? What's been lost?

Id: [0x000FF838]
I have enough to worry about with my little [jerboa](mice) running around. I'm curious about what they are up to. Not some old, dead gods.

Id: [0x000FF842]
Open the door!

Id: [0x000FF843]
Hush, little [jerboa](mouse). Get your chores done and don't bother me.

Id: [0x000FF844]
I do not have the key to your cell.

Id: [0x000FF84D]
Go and get the key from those wax-for-brains!

Id: [0x000FF84E]
The key! Go… and get… the key!

Id: [0x000FF85C]
Damn gutter brats. So unreliable.

Id: [0x000FF85D]
We will decide what to do with you later.

Id: [0x000FF860]
Act with caution in Siwa: the murder of the Heron was but the first. Two from among us here in Alexandria have also been killed.

Id: [0x000FF862]
However, the situation is under control... Gennadios is actively questioning the populace.

Id: [0x000FF864]
We commend your efforts, Ibis. Long life.

Id: [0x000FF875]
What do you expect? They ran wild in the streets for years.

Id: [0x000FF879]
Quit your mewling!

Id: [0x000FF87F]
Are the bandits gone?

Id: [0x000FF886]
Yes. It is safe now.

Id: [0x000FF891]
I will have you soon, poisoner.

Id: [0x000FF892]
How have you been holding up since I left?

Id: [0x000FF893]
It has been difficult, Bayek. Without you, the villagers look to me to keep order. But the soldiers have set up a garrison and they rule over all.

Id: [0x000FF894]
A garrison at Siwa?

Id: [0x000FF899]
Go to the temple of Hathor without me. The twins cannot be left alone.

Id: [0x000FF89C]
Go ahead, choose one. They are all of equal value.

Id: [0x000FF89D]
Thank you, my friend.

Id: [0x000FF89E]
Come by my shop anytime, Bayek.

Id: [0x000FF89F]
The shield is made with bronze and leather. Good protection - some weapons bounce right off it!

Id: [0x000FF8A0]
That spear sharp and long. You can keep back and still hurt your enemies.

Id: [0x000FF8A1]
It is not large, but that mace can crack a skull with the best of them!

Id: [0x000FF8A2]
That bow uses a special twine. It does not strike deep, but you can shoot very quickly.

Id: [0x000FF8A5]
He's going to be surprised.

Id: [0x000FF8A7]
Too many mosquitoes!

Id: [0x000FF8A9]
Where is he? I'm getting a cramp.

Id: [0x000FF8AB]
Keep alert. He can come from any direction.

Id: [0x000FF8B2]
Is anyone covering to the north?

Id: [0x000FF8B5]
I don't think he's coming.

Id: [0x000FF8CE]
There's no going back to your old life, Layla.

Id: [0x000FF8CF]
Very well, I'll get it. Apollodorus is waiting for you at the lighthouse.

Id: [0x000FF8D0]
I will tell him to find you near the sunken ship.

Id: [0x000FF8D3]
That doesn't mean I'm on your side.

Id: [0x000FF8D6]
You're a handsome one, aren't you?

Id: [0x000FF8D7]
That's very flattering, but --

Id: [0x000FF8D8]
You've got a good physique. Do you race?

Id: [0x000FF8D9]
I help out one of the teams is all...

Id: [0x000FF8DA]
The Blues? You race with the blues?

Id: [0x000FF8DB]
... Uh, yes! Yes I do.

Id: [0x000FF8DC]
You know, there's going to be a big party at one of the villas nearby. Want to come along?

Id: [0x000FF8DD]
That sounds nice...

Id: [0x000FF8DE]
Sometimes things get a little... wild.

Id: [0x000FF932]
What is one boy.

Id: [0x000FF943]
[COMBAT GRUNTS]

Id: [0x000FF944]
[COMBAT GRUNTS]

Id: [0x000FF945]
[falling yell and impact grunts]

Id: [0x000FF946]
[falling yell and impact grunts]

Id: [0x001000A9]
You've brought joy to Siwa.

Id: [0x001000AA]
And?

Id: [0x001000AB]
I have renounced Aya. I have killed Aya. I am now the Hidden One known as Amunet.

Id: [0x001000AC]
I can make that myself.

Id: [0x001000AD]
Weapons are more difficult. The soldiers took everything in the village.

Id: [0x001000AE]
I will talk to the blacksmith.

Id: [0x001000C8]
They're using bows, not guns. Why?

Id: [0x001000C9]
Guess they don't consider you much of a threat.

Id: [0x001000CA]
Huh.

Id: [0x001000D4]
Pothinus! You will be in The Duat soon! Prepare yourself!

Id: [0x001000DB]
This guy may have more valuable information. I need to bring him back to Caesar.

Id: [0x001000DD]
No surprise. You were designed to have boundaries, after all. And one cannot speak of that which one cannot conceive.

Id: [0x001000DE]
The Code. Equations that define life. They are nestled deep within every star, and every mote of dust. Every second that passes is a word, a symbol. All part of an intricate yet simple language existing within the framework of time itself.

Id: [0x001000DF]
It is the one rule which applies to us all. Immutable, inescapable. The Code is a bridge, a single point of cohesion between your civilization and… mine.

Id: [0x001000E0]
It is a language that can be read, that tells of what was, what is and what will be.

Id: [0x001000E1]
A language that We Who Came Before can read, though you cannot…

Id: [0x001000E2]
Time is a set of rules, not unlike the language you so dearly use to converse with your powerful machines.

Id: [0x001000E3]
Time is a system that defines what comes to be.

Id: [0x001000E5]
That is how we understand it.

Id: [0x001000E6]
The Code is Time, and Time is Code. As you scratch the surface and uncover the truth, ask yourself if there is something more? Something else.

Id: [0x001000E8]
No need to be puzzled. You've seen time written before. You are surrounded by it as we speak.

Id: [0x001000E9]
To your untrained mind, time might just look like paths and nodes. To us, it is not unlike a chalkboard covered in calculus. It reveals a window through which stretches the map to infinity.

Id: [0x001000EA]
(INAUDIBLE) See? As I speak of it in its true form, your mind is incapable of making sense of it.

Id: [0x001000EB]
Were you to read, you'd learn about the other simulations. You'd learn about the genesis of who you came to be. You'd learn about space and its fluidity.

Id: [0x001000EC]
Simply put, time is the language which existence is made of.

Id: [0x001000ED]
All our existences.

Id: [0x001000EE]
Yours, mine. And all those you dare not imagine.

Id: [0x001000F9]
Bayek! You're back!

Id: [0x001000FB]
Is that Bayek?

Id: [0x001000FD]
Thank Amun-Re. Bayek has returned to the oasis.

Id: [0x001000FF]
Is that who I think it is?

Id: [0x00100101]
Do my eyes deceive me?

Id: [0x00100103]
Be careful, Bayek! Siwa's not like it was.

Id: [0x00100105]
Bayek! Take care! Siwa is a dangerous place.

Id: [0x00100107]
Is that Bayek the Medjay?

Id: [0x00100109]
Look who's returned to the [wahat](oasis)!

Id: [0x0010010B]
Our Medjay has returned!

Id: [0x0010010D]
By the gods Amun and Iset, Bayek is back in Siwa.

Id: [0x0010010F]
Great god Amun! It is our own Bayek.

Id: [0x00100111]
And if we change the Pharos' light the rest of the fleet will know what to do. We will join them by chariot.

Id: [0x00100112]
And even then, my blood will stay on my throne.

Id: [0x0010013D]
I find that Phanos talks too much.

Id: [0x0010013E]
Flavius, please.

Id: [0x0010014A]
He has some interesting ideas. Very radical! It's almost alarming.

Id: [0x0010014B]
You're right about that, but can't he express them concisely?

Id: [0x0010014C]
Are you still here?

Id: [0x0010014D]
I'm too frightened to move.

Id: [0x0010014E]
This area is safe.

Id: [0x00100150]
He must have made it out.

Id: [0x00100151]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x00100152]
Bruised and beaten, but I can move.

Id: [0x00100153]
There are other priests taken. Four of them.

Id: [0x00100154]
Stay hidden until you can slip out of the temple.

Id: [0x00100157]
I recognize this mask! It belongs to one of them.

Id: [0x0010015D]
Bayek. I'm still here. Don't draw them back this way.

Id: [0x0010015E]
All right. Wait a moment.

Id: [0x00100160]
He's gotten away safely.

Id: [0x00100161]
Thanks be to Amun you came along, Bayek.

Id: [0x00100162]
They've taken four other priests. I pray they are all alive.

Id: [0x00100163]
Hide right here. When you are certain no one's around, get away from the temple.

Id: [0x001001B2]
Are you still here?

Id: [0x001001B3]
Do not worry about me. I am safe here.

Id: [0x001001B4]
The priest got out. Good.

Id: [0x001001BB]
Bayek! They will kill you if they find you.

Id: [0x001001BC]
There were four others. Do you know if they are all right?

Id: [0x001001BD]
I will find them. You hide here until it is safe to leave.

Id: [0x001001C6]
I am terrified they will find me again.

Id: [0x001001C7]
He's gotten away.

Id: [0x001001C8]
Thank the gods. We must stop this madness.

Id: [0x001001C9]
There are other priests being held. Four of them.

Id: [0x001001CA]
Hide here until you can get out without being seen.

Id: [0x001001D1]
That's the last one. I can take all the shards back to Siwa now.

Id: [0x001001E3]
The bow is Egyptian, but older than anything I have seen. It's deceptively light, and the balance is perfect! The limbs are made partly of a strange black stone. It is familiar…

Id: [0x001001E4]
I will look into it after I have dealt with this murderous leader!

Id: [0x001001ED]
The others should have been back by now. They couldn't have lost the fight… could they?

Id: [0x001001EE]
Against that bunch of dirt eating mud rakers? Haha, of course not! What am I thinking! They'll be back soon. Yeah, nothing to worry about.

Id: [0x001001EF]
This must be the place. The bandit leader is in this tomb. Gods, this is ancient. There is something unusual about the stonework. The markings are similar to those on Rai's bow…

Id: [0x001001FC]
Help, help! Someone slay these beasts!

Id: [0x00100200]
(crying)

Id: [0x00100204]
Now to return the Book to the old man.

Id: [0x00100205]
Has anyone seen my Book of the Dead?

Id: [0x00100206]
Without it, my spirit cannot follow my wife's to the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00100207]
No one can help me! No one has seen my Book!

Id: [0x00100208]
My Isesu… I will never see her again.

Id: [0x0010020B]
(desperate crying and wailing)

Id: [0x0010020C]
Isesu… my Isesu…

Id: [0x0010020D]
Isesu!

Id: [0x00100211]
See you at the Brothel, Aristotle.

Id: [0x0010021F]
This city is filthy, polluted by the riches of Romans and other tourists.

Id: [0x00100220]
At least we have work.

Id: [0x00100221]
Selling these statues?

Id: [0x00100225]
Ah, neb! Welcome to my humble shop.

Id: [0x00100226]
Seeking magical runes? Statuettes of uncommon value?

Id: [0x00100244]
I have not seen your kind in some time, Medjay.

Id: [0x00100245]
We are a rare breed. As are merchants who set up shop in a tomb.

Id: [0x00100246]
My customers appreciate privacy.

Id: [0x00100247]
They do not seem to appreciate variety.

Id: [0x00100248]
My customers know I can provide what they seek.

Id: [0x00100249]
I hope you can do the same for me. May I have a look around?

Id: [0x0010024A]
But of course! I'll leave you to browse.

Id: [0x0010024D]
A Medjay! How surprising.

Id: [0x001002BC]
The Doomsday clock, tucked away in an office of the University of Chicago. Its needle moving as the years go.

Id: [0x001002C0]
The color blue. We believe everyone sees it as we do. Ocean. Sky. International Klein Blue. What's to say yours and mine are of the same hue?

Id: [0x001002C1]
Do you truly see it as I do?

Id: [0x001002C5]
Retransmission. Segment 5. Acquiring Contemporaneity.

Id: [0x001002C6]
It has been one-hundred five days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.

Id: [0x001002C7]
Frequencies so high only a few can hear their cue. A heightened response to the taste of food. Colors invisible to the human eye save for a few. A high voice, perceived as living glass.

Id: [0x001002C8]
Color-blindness. Tinnitus. Supertasting. Tetrachromacy. Synesthesia.

Id: [0x001002CD]
You've browsed long enough, Medjay!

Id: [0x001002CF]
When does the next patrol head out?

Id: [0x001002D0]
Soon I think.

Id: [0x001002D2]
I have destroyed the war chariot that Eryx made, and was stolen by the vile captain of Anthylla. Your husband's memory is restored.

Id: [0x001002D3]
Your peace leaves many wanting.

Id: [0x001002D4]
Perceptions shape reality.

Id: [0x001002D5]
Reality is a mathematical model which gets solved over and over again by the observer.

Id: [0x001002D6]
Your thoughts are computations. And they render this world for you to call your own.

Id: [0x001002D7]
Not all processors are alike.

Id: [0x001002D8]
Different brains produce different realities. The variations go from the subtle to the drastic.

Id: [0x001002DC]
Your mind defines how much you can taste. How much you can feel. How much you can understand.

Id: [0x001002DD]
Perception defines perspective.

Id: [0x001002DE]
Where one sees a skull, the other sees a woman in a mirror. Where one hears silence, the other will hear entrancing voices.

Id: [0x001002DF]
You experience what your brain allows you to perceive.

Id: [0x001002E0]
We designed you and made sure to engineer your senses so you could perceive just what we needed you to. Neither more nor less.

Id: [0x001002E1]
There are parts of Time we preferred you to remain blind to. It was a necessity.

Id: [0x001002E2]
We have six senses, you have five. Can you guess the one missing?

Id: [0x001002E3]
The real cage is not around you. It is in you. Your mind will not allow you to wander in uncharted territories.

Id: [0x001002E4]
Events such as Upsweep and Julia fuel internet conspiracies. Sounds unknown, heard only once. A cabinet of curiosities for the Modern Age.

Id: [0x001002E5]
Human visionaries developed a vague awareness of their limits. They wrote obscure research papers, popular science fiction novels, some asking us to stop the world.

Id: [0x001002E7]
Reality is what the observer allows it to be.

Id: [0x001002E8]
The Doppler Effect. The Möbius strip. Deja-vus. Cicada 3301. UVB-76. Eureka effects. Ambigrams and Anamorphisis. P versus NP.

Id: [0x001002E9]
Is Schrödinger's cat dead or alive? It all depends on what you perceive, on what the cage is not hiding for you to see.

Id: [0x001002EA]
Think. Think. Let your mind be free. Explore the borders of your reality.

Id: [0x001002EB]
Well... I can try. This way I'll get two!

Id: [0x001002EC]
Sure.

Id: [0x001002EF]
(laughs)

Id: [0x001002F1]
(laughs)

Id: [0x001004DE]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x001004DF]
You always get too scared.

Id: [0x001008B2]
Wait! Stop!

Id: [0x001008B3]
No, no, no I will tell you, I will tell you, I will tell... no, no, no.

Id: [0x001008B4]
Aaaaaaah!

Id: [0x001008B6]
Help! Help me!

Id: [0x001008B7]
That's Chenzira!

Id: [0x001008B8]
I said shut up!

Id: [0x001008BA]
Medjay Bayek!

Id: [0x001008BF]
No, we wait until I see the signal. I can't believe you trusted a woman to do something of such importance. How are the fleet to receive their orders?

Id: [0x001008C2]
Patience Caesar.

Id: [0x001008C4]
Ha! Hey! Hey!

Id: [0x001008C9]
Show me the way to this warehouse.

Id: [0x001008CA]
Fine, fine. Follow me.

Id: [0x001008CB]
The warehouse, is it far from here?

Id: [0x001008CC]
Just around the palace near the western entrance leading to the desert.

Id: [0x001008CD]
We should hurry, I don't want to be scolded by the head priest again.

Id: [0x001008CE]
This is my last week on the job, you know.

Id: [0x001008CF]
Strike! We can't let them reach the warehouse!

Id: [0x001008D1]
There's no time to waste, I should get to the natron warehouse as soon as possible.

Id: [0x001008D2]
This should be the place. Better be careful.

Id: [0x001008D3]
I'll have to visit these smugglers myself.

Id: [0x001008D4]
I can't let them run this infamy any longer, I better take them all out.

Id: [0x001008E1]
I will find you if I can.

Id: [0x001008EA]
Another life spat on by that roman shit-eater.

Id: [0x001008EB]
Whispers… whispers…

Id: [0x001008EC]
What's that?

Id: [0x001008FE]
Die, soul-eater!

Id: [0x001008FF]
Be gone, swim to the pool of Nu.

Id: [0x00100903]
Murderous, greedy neket iadet. He won't be troubling the farmers anymore.

Id: [0x00100904]
He was carrying shards of black stone, probably found in the tomb beyond. It is the same material used on Rai's bow.

Id: [0x00100913]
Come on, finish me, you coward! The waste of time.

Id: [0x00100915]
I will be waiting for you in the field of reeds.

Id: [0x00100918]
Blackstone… great godly rock… I knew there was ancient treasure in these mountains! But this…

Id: [0x00100919]
I've never seen nothing like it!

Id: [0x0010091A]
This is the domain of the gods themselves! We could sell it all back in Krokodilopolis! And never return to this wasteland! We've a whole tomb full of Blackstone!

Id: [0x0010091C]
That's the one thing I do not regret in my life.

Id: [0x0010091E]
But when the Son of Ra stands on the mountain and says "do it", it gets done.

Id: [0x0010091F]
You burned farms. You killed innocents. You are insane.

Id: [0x00100921]
I can't do it, I can't, I can't do it!

Id: [0x00100923]
[Gasp]

Id: [0x00100924]
It's alright, papo...

Id: [0x00100927]
We did it.

Id: [0x00100928]
But there are more of them out there, and they will return. They were after father's bow!

Id: [0x00100929]
What? All this just for an old bow? Gods, why?! It doesn't make sense! I would have given it to them!

Id: [0x0010092A]
Maybe we still can…

Id: [0x0010092B]
They would have killed you anyway. There is only one way to stop men like this. I have to hunt down their leader.

Id: [0x0010092C]
I saw them come in from the Southeast. They could be camping in the foothills nearby.

Id: [0x0010092D]
Then that is where I will begin my search.

Id: [0x0010092E]
Bayek, before you go… please, take the bow. We'll be safer if you have it. It was damaged in the fighting, and it only brings me sadness now, anyway.

Id: [0x0010092F]
I am sure it still has some power. You honor me, Rai.

Id: [0x00100932]
A letter from the bandit leader. He is collecting ancient weapons. He wanted this bow so badly he killed for it. But why?

Id: [0x00100933]
He's not here. They have a new hideout in a nearby tomb. They think themselves unfindable. Well, my friends, here I come.

Id: [0x00100941]
Aya.

Id: [0x00100942]
When he returned, I forced him to wear it. Then I thrust this knife through his eye slits.

Id: [0x00100945]
And she trusts me. She gave me this to slit his throat.

Id: [0x00100946]
The wretched smell comes from within the tomb, but with this stench...

Id: [0x00100947]
You look capable, perhaps you'd care to take a look inside?

Id: [0x0010094F]
Many have doubted Aya.

Id: [0x00100966]
Ha! Did you see the look on their faces when the ship went down? Half of them didn't know how to swim!

Id: [0x00100968]
Target practice!

Id: [0x0010096A]
If Phoxidas had been on that ship, I would have chopped off his ears.

Id: [0x0010096C]
We got his lackey. His ears could use a trimming.

Id: [0x0010096E]
That ship belonged to the insurgent, Cleopatra! We'll get extra rations of beer for this!

Id: [0x00100970]
Would someone shut that stupid prisoner up?

Id: [0x00100972]
...you better be right about this, this place makes me wanna puke *gag sound*.

Id: [0x00100973]
Maybe if you stopped complaining, we'd be out of here faster.

Id: [0x00100974]
With this smell, at least we won't be bothered, keep looking!

Id: [0x00100975]
We won't find any treasures here, I tell you!

Id: [0x0010097C]
He was a conqueror.

Id: [0x0010097E]
You cannot blame one man for everything. All men are to blame. And women.

Id: [0x00100980]
Now let us open the door to our new rulers.

Id: [0x0010098C]
Pegasus! You're too far from me. Get back here this instant!

Id: [0x0010098F]
There you are, girl! Don't you ever leave me again.

Id: [0x00100991]
Bodyguard! We can't leave Pegasus here. Think of what could happen to her.

Id: [0x00100992]
We must go and get Pegasus. Now.

Id: [0x00100993]
Fine.

Id: [0x00100998]
He was a child Flavius. My child!

Id: [0x001009AD]
Should you not be plotting with Aya?

Id: [0x001009AF]
I am pleased you are enjoying Alexandria, but seriously, my good fellow, have you not got more important things to do?

Id: [0x001009B1]
After you see Aya, come find me at the theatre! There is plenty to do in this wondrous city.

Id: [0x001009B5]
Will you not fight?

Id: [0x001009B6]
I grow impatient to see how well you fight.

Id: [0x001009C2]
How are you keeping today?

Id: [0x001009C3]
Most well, thank you nebet. Life is certainly not easy here, but at least we work for ourselves. Not in fear of the lash and only to fill Sefetu's coffers.

Id: [0x001009C4]
Yes! Our hard work supports our families and friends.

Id: [0x001009C5]
The Firebrand has hurt so many people in this world that I am sure his heart will be eaten by Ammit the Devourer upon his death.

Id: [0x001009C6]
So it will be.

Id: [0x001009F2]
Stay vigilant!

Id: [0x001009F3]
Don't let any of the villagers get inside the temple.

Id: [0x001009F4]
Can't wait to leave this hole...

Id: [0x001009F5]
I need results...

Id: [0x001009F6]
There must be a way.

Id: [0x001009F7]
What are you hiding?

Id: [0x001009F8]
The medicine could be anywhere in this lake. Senu can help me.

Id: [0x001009F9]
Rabiah is waiting for these jars.

Id: [0x00100A00]
Teremun. Not like him to give up.

Id: [0x00100A01]
Where is Teremun? Ah! Dear Amun, he has died from his wounds.

Id: [0x00100A02]
I don't see Teremun... wait...

Id: [0x00100A03]
There he is, he's dead.

Id: [0x00100A04]
His family will want to bury him properly.

Id: [0x00100A05]
Did Flavius look different to you? Taller?

Id: [0x00100A06]
Suppose it's better than guarding silphium.

Id: [0x00100A07]
Look smart or the General will have your heads!

Id: [0x00100A08]
Could be worse, we could be in Britannia.

Id: [0x00100A09]
I saw what Flavius did in Siwa, still gives me nightmares.

Id: [0x00100A0A]
Will you follow Flavius?

Id: [0x00100A0B]
For every son.

Id: [0x00100A0C]
For your son?

Id: [0x00100A26]
The priest will be glad to see the relics returned.

Id: [0x00100A2C]
Battos' medallion.

Id: [0x00100A2F]
This must be the bow of Battos'.

Id: [0x00100A38]
Osiris awaits, brother!

Id: [0x00100A3B]
Hey, malakia!

Id: [0x00100A3E]
You won't best me!

Id: [0x00100A42]
(Laugh) Now that was a show! You are a warrior.

Id: [0x00100A43]
Have I proven myself?

Id: [0x00100A44]
I will find your champion and your trophy.

Id: [0x00100A47]
What happened here? I must find Polymestor.

Id: [0x00100A49]
The body has been moved. I need to find it.

Id: [0x00100A4F]
The Lanista's sword, I should talk to Polymestor.

Id: [0x00100A54]
Let us end this. I will run no more, Lanista.

Id: [0x00100A55]
Shut up you metrokoites.

Id: [0x00100A5A]
Bayek. That bastard had no code, I earned my life back a thousand-fold. But I made too much coin for him. In the arena and the rich Roman beds.

Id: [0x00100A5D]
Thanks, I will stain it with the proper blood, the deserving blood. What will you do?

Id: [0x00100A5E]
Fish, mend my nets and find a good, plump woman to settle down with. I will make the most of this new life.

Id: [0x00100A64]
I am looking for a gladiator, the Thracian Bear.

Id: [0x00100A65]
Another of the Lanista's cronies. How much did he pay you to slit my throat?

Id: [0x00100A66]
He only wants his sword.

Id: [0x00100A67]
Yes, covered in my guts. How did you find me, the farmers?

Id: [0x00100A68]
I am sorry, Polymestor your friends are dead.

Id: [0x00100A69]
This is the Lanista's doing. I gave him my life and now I will take his.

Id: [0x00100A6A]
Hey you there, big strong Egyptian!

Id: [0x00100A6C]
Get many Egyptians in Cyrene?

Id: [0x00100A6D]
You'll get no judgment from the Mouse, but you did stick out.

Id: [0x00100A6E]
The Mouse? An odd title my friend.

Id: [0x00100A71]
Oh cursed Mouse! Woeful Mouse! They took it, they took everything, Sir Bayek.

Id: [0x00100A73]
The Roman swine must have taken my chest to the barracks. Please, will you recover it?

Id: [0x00100A74]
And why would I do that?

Id: [0x00100A75]
Because you know what it's like to be brushed aside, victimized by those who hold themselves above you.

Id: [0x00100A76]
And I could probably spare a fine reward for my savior.

Id: [0x00100A7C]
No... I will... I will lose you forever.

Id: [0x00100A84]
The relics are gone.

Id: [0x00100A85]
Something is missing.

Id: [0x00100A89]
How is the house coming?

Id: [0x00100A8A]
Slow, to be honest. It's hard to get all the materials I need to properly fix it up.

Id: [0x00100A8B]
Yes, I know how it goes. It took me months to gather everything I needed for our home.

Id: [0x00100A8C]
Have you heard the stories of Letopolis?

Id: [0x00100A8D]
In passing. But I would rather scrounge for materials here than have to shovel for weeks under the hot sun for my house.

Id: [0x00100A8F]
Old wisdom neb (sir), I have acquired from long nights in the desert with my camel.

Id: [0x00100A9A]
O you door-keepers who guard your portals, who swallow souls and who gulp down the corpses of the dead.

Id: [0x00100A9C]
Look papo! I am the Great Hunter Orion.

Id: [0x00100A9D]
What a journey I have made, the things I have seen. I am but one of you.

Id: [0x00100ABB]
Leave my son out of this!

Id: [0x00100ABC]
Papo.

Id: [0x00100ABD]
Papo. I did what you said, but-

Id: [0x00100ABE]
It's all right, son. No?

Id: [0x00100ADE]
He's stalling for time.

Id: [0x00100B58]
I will never give you peace!

Id: [0x00100B59]
You are right! Leave the desert for the gods!

Id: [0x00100B60]
The little ones are sleeping finally.

Id: [0x00100B61]
Thank you for checking on them. May Serapis watch over them and smooth their dreams.

Id: [0x00100B62]
What they survived… what you escaped, it is too much to bear.

Id: [0x00100B63]
If I could put Sefetu's face into the fire, it would not be enough.

Id: [0x00100B64]
I know, I know. Let it go. You are safe now. Your little ones are safe. Leave it behind you.

Id: [0x00100B65]
I will try.

Id: [0x00100B85]
They wake up screaming every night.

Id: [0x00100B88]
What is that? Some kind of tomb?

Id: [0x00100B89]
Papo?

Id: [0x00100B8C]
I am he who drives off the destructive one.

Id: [0x00100B8E]
You will not devour my heart!

Id: [0x00100B8F]
I am he who knots the chord and lashes the shrine together.

Id: [0x00100B90]
I will not go into the valley of darkness!

Id: [0x00100B91]
You will not claim me, Destructive one.

Id: [0x00100B92]
I am the great one within his eye!

Id: [0x00100B93]
Return to the chaos sea.

Id: [0x00100B94]
Senu! What do you see?

Id: [0x00100B97]
That shadow, that is the soul eater!

Id: [0x00100B98]
Why are we still here? Everyone's fled or worse.

Id: [0x00100BAE]
Now. Did Istellah say where she was going?

Id: [0x00100BAF]
She went to the chasm camp to find help.

Id: [0x00100BB1]
I know. If not for Bayek, those snakes would have eaten me whole.

Id: [0x00100BB5]
Can't wait until we get on the taxation route again.

Id: [0x00100BB6]
I hate riding around and having to chase down people.

Id: [0x00100BC8]
You are looking at it wrong. Think of what opportunities it presents outside of Nikiou.

Id: [0x00100BDB]
See anything yet?

Id: [0x00100BDC]
No.

Id: [0x00100BDD]
What are you looking for?

Id: [0x00100BDE]
Trouble.

Id: [0x00100BDF]
Expecting any?

Id: [0x00100BE0]
Always.

Id: [0x00100BE7]
Uh, good talking with you.

Id: [0x00100BFE]
You are Aya's Medjay, huh?

Id: [0x00100C03]
We still have not found the man who killed Khemu.

Id: [0x00100C1F]
Wait! I do not want to go through the water. That is where the snakes came from. Please?

Id: [0x00100C20]
Very well. I will find another way.

Id: [0x00100C23]
Does Siwa have a great course for racing?

Id: [0x00100C24]
No, we are a small village. We did have chariots. The old kingdom and its Pharaohs brought them.

Id: [0x00100C25]
I envy that freedom.

Id: [0x00100C36]
What's going on? Something's wrong!

Id: [0x00100C37]
Father!

Id: [0x00100C38]
Hurry, Bayek!

Id: [0x00100C3A]
Where is my son!?

Id: [0x00100C3D]
Hurry, men! We can't let these brazen raiders get away with this! The honor of Prasina Green depends on it!

Id: [0x00100C3E]
For Prasina Green!

Id: [0x00100C3F]
For Philocrates! For Saganaki!

Id: [0x00100C43]
Out of the way!

Id: [0x00100C4B]
Brace yourself! Hard left!

Id: [0x00100C51]
Keep a sharp eye out! Father loves that horse more than m-. More than all the others we've raced!

Id: [0x00100C53]
If Icarus were still here, they would never have tried this! Let us find Saganaki and return as champions!

Id: [0x00100C54]
For Icarus! For Prasina Green!

Id: [0x00100C55]
For the Green!

Id: [0x00100C5A]
They're escaping!

Id: [0x00100C5B]
Get the traitors!

Id: [0x00100C6A]
You better be as fast with your bow as they claim or we will be dead.

Id: [0x00100C6B]
You focus on driving. I will keep these fools at bay.

Id: [0x00100C6C]
Odd way to speak of your countrymen.

Id: [0x00100C6D]
Any who would give up on our people is no countryman of mine.

Id: [0x00100C73]
We did it! Once we bring Saganaki home, father will reward us with his l- will reward you all!

Id: [0x00100C74]
You did well, Nikias.

Id: [0x00100C77]
Are you going to race Saganaki in the Hippodrome?

Id: [0x00100C7C]
Maybe father will allow me to, now.

Id: [0x00100C7D]
If Icarus was still with us, what a team you would have made!

Id: [0x00100C7E]
The gods smiled on us today. Perhaps they will also smile upon us at the races.

Id: [0x00100C86]
You saved my life, my friend.

Id: [0x00100C87]
Praxilla would not have forgiven me if I had let you fall at Leander's hand.

Id: [0x00100C88]
Why would he do this? Was his lust for power so consuming that he would commit murder?

Id: [0x00100C89]
I have seen men do worse for less.

Id: [0x00100C8A]
We are only alive thanks to you, Bayek. Cyrene deserved better than him at her helm.

Id: [0x00100C8D]
Vitruvius? I know this man, I cannot believe he would make something like this.

Id: [0x00100CA5]
Bayek, the Medjay from Siwa? I recognize you!

Id: [0x00100CA6]
Please, my daughter has got herself in terrible trouble.

Id: [0x00100CAF]
You must miss him very much?

Id: [0x00100CB0]
All my waking and sleeping hours.

Id: [0x00100CB1]
You will see him again in The Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00100CB2]
I hope so. Nenet spoke of the home of the huntress?

Id: [0x00100CB3]
If Flavius is there, I will find him and destroy every fiber of his ka.

Id: [0x00100CB5]
Vitruvius' book, saved for posterity.

Id: [0x00100CB6]
You! You saved me before. I thought you were a dream! You are a friend of Praxillas!

Id: [0x00100CB7]
You are making a habit of getting into trouble.

Id: [0x00100CB8]
(laughs) Yes, the plant reveals what is in the seed… I will take more care in future. Thank you, protector.

Id: [0x00100CBC]
The villa papers! Diocles will be happy.

Id: [0x00100CCA]
No. They won't stop until I stop them.

Id: [0x00100CCB]
The Temple of Mars. Good to see our Roman Gods outside of Rome.

Id: [0x00100CCC]
Hold on! Hold on!

Id: [0x00100CCD]
The brotherhood!

Id: [0x00100CCE]
The brotherhood!

Id: [0x00100CCF]
The brotherhood!

Id: [0x00100CD0]
The brotherhood!

Id: [0x00100CE9]
Anubis' Lord of the dead! Did that crazy old fool poison me?

Id: [0x00100CEB]
I guess I am too late.

Id: [0x00100CEC]
It is not my time yet!

Id: [0x00100D11]
You cannot lock us up like this!

Id: [0x00100D12]
This is a holy place! The sacred Temple of Amun!

Id: [0x00100D13]
The gods will not forgive you!

Id: [0x00100D14]
Bayek! Is that really you?

Id: [0x00100D15]
Stay calm. I will get you out of there.

Id: [0x00100D19]
Dead man walking.

Id: [0x00100D1A]
This murderer will be punished with the full weight of Rome.

Id: [0x00100D29]
So, the scouts were right. You're Bayek. The Medjay from Siwa. Son of the Nile and defender of the people.

Id: [0x00100D2B]
My oath is to protect. Tell me more.

Id: [0x00100D2C]
Sebni, my cousin, told the children stories of Alexander The Great. Of course, two of the children decided that meant there was treasure of his to discover nearby.

Id: [0x00100D2E]
Do you know where they are?

Id: [0x00100D2F]
Yes. One of our scouts saw them. They're being held prisoner in camp Hetoimazo, north of here.

Id: [0x00100D30]
I will find him, and then the children.

Id: [0x00100D32]
Mister, mister! Over here!

Id: [0x00100D36]
Hera mother goddess. Simonides? Are you drunk?

Id: [0x00100D38]
I have never seen the like!

Id: [0x00100D39]
I would like to see that.

Id: [0x00100D3A]
I can't watch! Tell me when it's over.

Id: [0x00100D3C]
We are the last of the Medjay my love.

Id: [0x00100D3D]
Come share a beer, seni.

Id: [0x00100D3E]
The masked ones are everywhere. May Amun walk at your side.

Id: [0x00100D3F]
Bring me the heads of the Order.

Id: [0x00100D40]
We miss you in Alexandria.

Id: [0x00100D41]
Just admit that you lost it!

Id: [0x00100D42]
It was taken from me mother. Do not fret, I'll get it back. I only need a small bit of help!

Id: [0x00100D48]
Stay here. Wait until it is safe, and someone will free you. You have my word.

Id: [0x00100D4F]
This is inevitable. A good rule always does. My apologies, Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x00100D65]
A new life awaits you in Letopolis!

Id: [0x00100D66]
A world that you make yourself with your brothers and sisters!

Id: [0x00100D67]
A new city that is a veritable oasis in the middle of the desert!

Id: [0x00100D68]
Come to Letopolis! Live the life you always wanted!

Id: [0x00100D6B]
You never learned to throw a real punch!

Id: [0x00100D6C]
Come on! Aya hit harder than you!

Id: [0x00100D6D]
You spend too much time with your fans.

Id: [0x00100D6E]
Shut up!

Id: [0x00100D6F]
No, you shut up!

Id: [0x00100D70]
Come on, Medjay, hit me!

Id: [0x00100D71]
I'm so sick of hearing about you Medjay!

Id: [0x00100D75]
Enough has been said. Let the gods judge you in the Hippodrome.

Id: [0x00100D80]
But we raced our steeds in the desert, chasing the wind and the stars as if our lives depended on it.

Id: [0x00100D89]
Yes, in a moment. I'm curious, Reda. Where are your parents?

Id: [0x00100D8A]
Long story, seni. A phylakitai of Alexandria caught them stealing and boiled them in a bronze bull.

Id: [0x00100D8B]
By Anubis, I am sorry Reda.

Id: [0x00100D8E]
No need, the gods took my family but gave me my camel, Amun, a great steed. I wander the desert and see the sun set when I want to. This is my freedom.

Id: [0x00100D8F]
I see, as always, you are wise beyond your years.

Id: [0x00100D91]
*Cough Cough* Smells like the gates of the underworld were flung open! Must be the right spot.

Id: [0x00100FF4]
Yes, Osiris hears not the mourning of the weary-hearted. You wanna sell or buy anything seni? The future is golden.

Id: [0x00100FF6]
Nenet will be safer in Balagrae. I have things to take care of, so find me there later.

Id: [0x00100FFD]
Reda! Good to see you. Yes, of course they have, thank you. You know, at times I feel we are family.

Id: [0x00100FFE]
Then she died in the nile...from a hippo attack! I was left with nothing but this camel. A sad tale.

Id: [0x00100FFF]
Oh really? Your memory must be off, too many hours out in the sun baking your mind. The past is what our dreams make of it! Ha, well.

Id: [0x00101001]
Yes, yes, what can I offer you today? You gonna buy something or not?

Id: [0x00101005]
Once again, you have come to our rescue. We will forever be in your debt, at this rate.

Id: [0x00101006]
Hetanu is safe. Khamet is with him.

Id: [0x00101007]
Oh, thank the gods. I wish I could say the same for Istellah. Their leader, Medon, took her as she arrived.

Id: [0x00101009]
He wanted the great shield she was carrying, and when she refused to give it to him, he snatched her up. He kept asking her if there was more treasure.

Id: [0x0010100B]
Please, you must go find her. Medon will torture her to get what he wants.

Id: [0x0010100D]
I will find her. And I will take care of Medon.

Id: [0x00101011]
Phylakitai, please! Are you a protector? If you have a moment? The fate of our founder is at stake!

Id: [0x00101012]
It longs to be in the service of Cyrenaica again. Please, keep it, maybe teach the Romans a lesson in honoring the dead?

Id: [0x00101014]
You could say that. My champion the Thracian Bear escaped. He is a trained killer, mad as a hyena on heat. There's a bounty on him, good money if you survive.

Id: [0x0010101A]
Polymestor's a deadly son of a bitch, fought in Arenas all across the Republic.

Id: [0x0010101E]
The Centurion's new horse is one magnificent animal.

Id: [0x0010101F]
Fast as Zephyrus and fair as Narcissus.

Id: [0x00101020]
What happened in Siwa? I've heard rumors but…

Id: [0x00101021]
Flavius and that other bloke, the traitor used the relics to open the vault. Some Egyptian tried to stop them and then Hades was unleashed.

Id: [0x00101022]
Men should concern themselves with the affairs of men, not gods.

Id: [0x00101023]
Sertor Clodianus may be a drunken scrota, but he can get his hands on anything.

Id: [0x00101024]
The scrounger is certainly living up to his nickname.

Id: [0x00101026]
Such confidence, I like it! I might even shed a tear if he guts you.

Id: [0x0010102B]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0010102C]
An Egyptian like yourself seni, for the safety of Egypt, we must flee.

Id: [0x00101033]
For Egypt.

Id: [0x00101039]
Rush in and die, you dogs!

Id: [0x0010103A]
He's got a sword! Take him!

Id: [0x0010103E]
Your mistake, old man!

Id: [0x0010103F]
Besides I know how to stay hidden, Sir Bayek, with the way I look, I have to. People think the Mouse is unlucky. They don't see I'm an entrepreneur and savior of the waifs and strays.

Id: [0x00101041]
Waifs and strays?

Id: [0x00101042]
Well that depends! Do you think I can do it?

Id: [0x00101044]
Wait until I tell my sister about today!

Id: [0x00101049]
Swords, spears, arrows. This was not one man, it was a massacre.

Id: [0x0010104A]
That Thracian dogshagger won't come quietly. But the reward is for the weapon, you understand?

Id: [0x0010104D]
You! You are that fearless Egyptian. I saw you fight like a god in the arena.

Id: [0x0010104E]
Hermes my boy! You really found him!

Id: [0x00101053]
Cut off every head of this sick Order.

Id: [0x00101054]
This is a waste of time! Your life, this revenge!

Id: [0x00101058]
I would never have trusted a farmer like you to protect me.

Id: [0x00101080]
You are a natural!

Id: [0x00101081]
With you riding for the Green, I'm sure we can win in the Hippodrome!

Id: [0x00101082]
Faster, Bayek, faster!

Id: [0x00101083]
Icarus was the true master of the races. Something Claridas hopes to aspire to.

Id: [0x00101084]
My father loved Icarus. He was his favorite ch- his favorite rider.

Id: [0x001010B8]
(INAUDIBLE)

Id: [0x001010CA]
Good then, I stay. My life is yours to do with as you will.

Id: [0x001010CF]
Alala! Bless the blue horses! Bless the blue!

Id: [0x001010D2]
Hear me, oh Ares Alalaxios!

Id: [0x001010D3]
Alala! Raise the war cry! Alala! Bless the blue horses! Alala! Bless the blue!

Id: [0x001010D4]
Since I was only young… [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x001010DB]
Behind us! The chariot gains!

Id: [0x001010DD]
It gave me an Empire of a thousand sons each one greater than the last.

Id: [0x001010E3]
I followed the racers… [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x001010E4]
Of blessed Veneta Blue. [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x001010E5]
The team always for me. [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x001010E6]
OOOOOOHHHHH! OOOOHHH!!!! OOOHHHH!!!!

Id: [0x001010F3]
(INAUDIBLE)

Id: [0x001010F4]
For centuries, humanity has fought for freedom.

Id: [0x001010F5]
A Faraday cage, for the mind. A concealed strait jacket.

Id: [0x001010F7]
And yet, they were messages, just like this one, waiting for their observer, their compatible processor.

Id: [0x001010F9]
But that's all they ever were. Fictions. How could they not be?

Id: [0x001010FB]
Oh, Taweret, the hippopotamus who walks. Lady of the Birth House, she is the goddess of fertility and childbirth. Mistress of the Horizon, she brings with her the yearly flood of Ar.

Id: [0x0010111C]
Have you seen the teacher?

Id: [0x0010111D]
He and another man are being held in the camp to the east.

Id: [0x0010111E]
Gather your men. We will attack the camp and free them.

Id: [0x0010112C]
I am Hetanu. Thank you, wer neb, for rescuing me.

Id: [0x0010112D]
I am no lord. You may call me Bayek. Now. Tell me what happened here, child.

Id: [0x0010112E]
We came looking for the legendary treasure of Alexander the Great. Our teacher told us all about him, and we knew there had to be more!

Id: [0x0010112F]
We managed to get into the temple, but then the snakes came out of the water, and surrounded us.

Id: [0x00101131]
What about Istellah?

Id: [0x00101132]
She did not want to leave me, but I told her to go and get help.

Id: [0x00101133]
Let's get you out of here first. Follow me.

Id: [0x00101148]
Alala! Bless the blue horses! Bless the blue!

Id: [0x0010114D]
Since I was only young… [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x0010114E]
I followed the racers… [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x0010114F]
Of blessed Veneta Blue. [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x00101150]
The team always for me. [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x00101151]
OOOOOOHHHHH! OOOOHHH!!!! OOOHHHH!!!!

Id: [0x00101152]
Since I was only young… [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x00101153]
I followed the racers… [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x00101154]
Of blessed Veneta Blue. [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x00101155]
The team always for me. [clap clap clap clap]

Id: [0x00101156]
OOOOOOHHHHH! OOOOHHH!!!! OOOHHHH!!!!

Id: [0x00101157]
Leap onto the track with your green chariots!

Id: [0x00101158]
The wheels make thunder and dust fills the air!

Id: [0x00101159]
Crack the whip, urge the steeds forward!

Id: [0x0010115A]
Beware the too sharp or the too wide turn!

Id: [0x0010115B]
Wreck the blues! Smash their wheels!

Id: [0x0010115C]
Guide our racers past the twisted wrecks, let the green fly to victory!

Id: [0x0010115D]
For the green! For the green!

Id: [0x0010115E]
For the green! For the green!

Id: [0x00101163]
My dear, sweet, Halius… my poor, sweet baby.

Id: [0x00101164]
W-why are the gods so cruel? How could they do this t-to you? And now Icarius gone, t-too!

Id: [0x00101165]
M-my life is accursed!

Id: [0x00101187]
Khemu? Where have you gone?

Id: [0x00101188]
I found some... Hyenas!! Papo! Help!

Id: [0x00101189]
Dear lord Amun.

Id: [0x0010118B]
You got him.

Id: [0x0010118C]
Stay close to me, son.

Id: [0x001013F5]
We-we came to pay our respects to Icarus. To make an offering for him to ride victoriously in the next life, but, b-but…

Id: [0x001013F6]
Shh. Gently now. I am listening.

Id: [0x001013F7]
Blue ruffians came at us! They jeered at our sorrow, and when my Halius spat in their faces they struck him down! They killed him! Then stole a bust of Icarus and ran.

Id: [0x001013F8]
Nebet, what grief has swallowed you?

Id: [0x001013F9]
Reda, when we last spoke their fate involved a bronze bull.

Id: [0x001013FD]
No-one can climb that high… can they?

Id: [0x00101401]
You jumped into a moving cart! How did you dare!

Id: [0x00101402]
But I like him because he has a bow and arrow and likes to hunt. Do you like to hunt, Bayek?

Id: [0x00101404]
Apollo is sure to reward me now!

Id: [0x00101408]
Hey, Bayek! We haven't finished the tour!

Id: [0x00101409]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010140D]
Bayek! You're back, you ready for your next jump?

Id: [0x0010140F]
Nobody is allowed up there except the Romans. But you look like you can handle a few measly bucket heads. Are you ready, Bayek? I present the Acropolis!

Id: [0x00101414]
Don't let the Romans see you!

Id: [0x00101415]
Hera mother of gods! It's too high!

Id: [0x00101417]
Go on jump Bayek, jump from the top of the tower!

Id: [0x00101418]
I know you can do it! Don't think about the watery depths!

Id: [0x00101419]
No! No! I heard the Romans keep a kraken in there!

Id: [0x0010141A]
Bayek can take on a kraken, can't you, Bayek?

Id: [0x0010141E]
Farewell Bayek. Come back when I'm older and we'll get married.

Id: [0x0010141F]
Do you think with practice we could leap like that?

Id: [0x00101420]
Look! We're here!

Id: [0x00101427]
Flea! I told my sister about you and she forgot all about Diocles!

Id: [0x00101429]
Look everyone! It's the Flea of Cyrene.

Id: [0x0010142B]
The Centurion locked his tomb, some say he desecrated the dead in there, left a scrawled note on the door and sauntered back to the Acropolis.

Id: [0x00101431]
The Romans have no respect! Did you find anything?

Id: [0x00101432]
And the bow?

Id: [0x00101438]
Medjay! I hear Battos' bow is serving you well!

Id: [0x00101439]
The medallion is safely within the hand of the founder. Thank you again, Medjay.

Id: [0x0010143A]
Not so fast, Egyptian. I will only hire you if you show me you are capable of ripping the bear apart.

Id: [0x0010143F]
I threw the sword in the sea. Take it, it has brought me nothing but bad luck.

Id: [0x00101440]
For Thrace and true freedom!

Id: [0x00101447]
Bayek! I finally got me a wife and she makes the best fish stew.

Id: [0x00101448]
You saved my life, I will not forget that.

Id: [0x0010144C]
Yes, yes, I am the Mouse because I can access the more hard to find trinkets. If you follow me to my shop, I'll show you…

Id: [0x00101451]
The Mouse will die on the streets with no living to support him, and what of the children... will no-one think of the children?

Id: [0x00101452]
I would not want the children on my conscience.

Id: [0x00101458]
Bayek! Look at that! What is it?

Id: [0x00101459]
Ancient writing. From the Old Kingdom.

Id: [0x0010145A]
I would like to know myself. Must be very old.

Id: [0x0010145B]
Someday I'll learn to read what it says.

Id: [0x0010145C]
Which way did you get in?

Id: [0x0010145D]
That way. But that's where the hyenas are.

Id: [0x0010145E]
Keep close.

Id: [0x0010145F]
Come back! That's too hard for me to climb.

Id: [0x00101460]
Here! Through here.

Id: [0x00101461]
That's too high for me over there. This is the only way out.

Id: [0x00101462]
Bayek? Over here.

Id: [0x00101463]
Come on! Let's go.

Id: [0x0010146B]
I mean… she did… we used to…

Id: [0x0010146D]
Let me talk to that farmer the captain was threatening. I'll spread the word.

Id: [0x0010146E]
Let me help, then.

Id: [0x00101470]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x00101471]
Lighting your fires.

Id: [0x00101474]
You don't give up, do you?

Id: [0x00101475]
There you are. It's time to rise up against the soldiers. Hotephres will fight with you.

Id: [0x00101477]
But it will not be enough. The soldiers will come in greater numbers now.

Id: [0x00101478]
I might have a better idea. Bayek, could you accompany me on a short journey?

Id: [0x00101479]
I am ready. Let's go.

Id: [0x0010147A]
And I will need you on my side when it matters.

Id: [0x00101493]
Leander said to count to one hundred.

Id: [0x00101494]
Oh, have you been counting?

Id: [0x00101495]
No... have you?

Id: [0x00101496]
Jove's beard, everyone's probably dead by now!

Id: [0x0010149A]
You don't know that. Leander's secrets are his alone.

Id: [0x0010149B]
We owe it to Cyrene to put an end to his corruption.

Id: [0x001014A1]
So, here you all are, plotting against me!

Id: [0x001014A2]
My Roman friends would beg to differ.

Id: [0x001014A5]
Bayek! We must protect the magistrates!

Id: [0x001014A6]
You demon, Leander! These men are unarmed.

Id: [0x001014A7]
You are traitors to Cyrene and Rome.

Id: [0x001014A8]
And for that you will die.

Id: [0x001014AD]
I know you will lead them well, Diocles.

Id: [0x001014B1]
And washing behind the ears I bet?

Id: [0x001014C8]
Bayek of Siwa? What are you of now? (laughs)

Id: [0x001014CA]
The stars brought me. The stars will take me too.

Id: [0x001014CE]
Still so handsome, if I were a girl again I would give Aya reason to be jealous!

Id: [0x001014CF]
It has been so long, Bayek. Too long.

Id: [0x001014D0]
You and Aya, you walk such a dangerous path. Medjays. The last.

Id: [0x001014D1]
So you remember when we were children? We lived so fiercely, so free.

Id: [0x001014D4]
Can't believe this idiot tried to attack all of us.

Id: [0x001014D5]
I've always said green fans are the dumbest.

Id: [0x001014D6]
What are we going to do with him? That bust was nice, but he didn't have any money on him.

Id: [0x001014DA]
Quiet. I'm here to get you back to your mother.

Id: [0x001014DB]
They murdered my brother, but there were too many for me. I'm hurt. You have to help me kill them!

Id: [0x001014DC]
All right. We will show them justice.

Id: [0x001014E0]
Time to go home.

Id: [0x001014E1]
Wait, Medjay! These sagging cocks stole a bust of Icarus that my mother had prepared for the great charioteer's memorial.

Id: [0x001014E2]
I can make it home, but I am too weak to find the bust. Please, find the bust of my namesake, and bring it back to my mother.

Id: [0x001014E3]
As I must.

Id: [0x001014E6]
Even in death you ignite their passions, Icarus.

Id: [0x001014F9]
Medjay, you saved my son. A thousand thanks and more I owe you.

Id: [0x001014FB]
The bust of Icarus! Now Prasina has a chance in the upcoming games.

Id: [0x00101526]
But you'd finally be able to work on the Animus Project… our version of it.

Id: [0x0010152C]
Did you find Simonides? He's probably sleeping it off by the brothel.

Id: [0x00101532]
Bayek my friend! I had a letter from Praxilla. She wishes you well.

Id: [0x00101533]
Leander bled us dry, but Cyrene is returning to health. Thanks to you.

Id: [0x00101537]
Bayek! You've seen me at my best and worst. But at least we are alive and Cyrene is free of that detestable hog Leander.

Id: [0x0010153A]
Diocles is a good soul. There's no-one finer to bet our fortune on. Not betting is my particular vice.

Id: [0x0010153B]
I should warn Diocles, he could be in danger.

Id: [0x00101543]
Do you return to torture me? Go, my friend, go.

Id: [0x00101544]
Hopefully I can sober Simonides up before we confront Leander.

Id: [0x0010154B]
He would have murdered us all. Fortune molds human affairs as she pleases, eh? As the great poet Plautus would say.

Id: [0x0010154D]
Papers, records of bribes, treasury theft. His guards caught me before I could take them. I convinced them I was simply inebriated.

Id: [0x00101553]
I threw the sword away, it can rust with the sea god for all I care.

Id: [0x00101559]
You! Egyptian. You find my damn sword yet?

Id: [0x00101566]
Then money, I will shower you with riches to make Croesus jealous.

Id: [0x00101569]
Where are you going, Bayek?

Id: [0x0010156C]
Bayek? It's you! The gods answered the Mouse's weeping prayers and returned you to me!

Id: [0x00101571]
Sir Bayek, my eyes weep in joy at the sight of you.

Id: [0x00101572]
Did you hear? Some black market merchant is trying to undercut me!

Id: [0x00101574]
Ugly to kill in front of the little ones. What happened here?

Id: [0x00101576]
[low, guttural cry of rage and pain]

Id: [0x0010157B]
You are injured.

Id: [0x0010157C]
It has to be me!

Id: [0x0010157D]
Is your need worth leaving the children unprotected?

Id: [0x00101581]
If you take on the armies of Ptolemy, I'd like to be at your side.

Id: [0x0010158C]
An abandoned tomb? The maidservant said there was a shop here. Strange place for a shop.

Id: [0x00101599]
Will you guard me and my maid until it is done? There may be dangers on the road as well.

Id: [0x001015B4]
Down with Caesar!

Id: [0x001015C4]
The message is incomplete. I wonder what the rest of it says?

Id: [0x001015C9]
"And in the second chamber lie the worldly goods of Horapollo and Shesh, to protect them and provide them sustenance."

Id: [0x001015CA]
There's something you should know.

Id: [0x001015CB]
This natron... isn't the real deal. It's been cut. I assume it's sand they're using.

Id: [0x001015CC]
Where does it come from?

Id: [0x001015CD]
From the natron mine to a local warehouse and then here.

Id: [0x001015CE]
Let's pay this warehouse a visit then.

Id: [0x001015CF]
Are you the owner here?

Id: [0x001015D0]
They were Sehetep's men. It is time to finish this.

Id: [0x001015D5]
There is no Pharaoh or god in the arena to protect you, Medjay. [Laughs, the spits]

Id: [0x001015D7]
You cannot be seen to move against him. Not if the cult is to survive. A priest killing a priest looks bad. I should do this.

Id: [0x001015D8]
You are right. You will find him at the Northern Temple. I will meet you outside.

Id: [0x001015DA]
Sounds delicious but get to the part about the master's tool? Your lunch won't solve this crime…

Id: [0x001015E4]
Are you Dedi?

Id: [0x001015E5]
You have it? You have my dioptra?

Id: [0x001015E6]
Thank you Bayek, you saved my… our people's lives. I am in your debt.

Id: [0x001015F6]
Who dares touch a god of Egypt? I'll hunt down this blasphemer.

Id: [0x001015F8]
A purple dress. Just like the Hibiscus flower.

Id: [0x00101605]
There were some herons nearby, down by that tree.

Id: [0x0010160F]
Please find the dioptra. My head is so much better attached to my shoulders!

Id: [0x00101618]
I just need to talk to you.

Id: [0x00101619]
Ow! Get off me you brute!

Id: [0x0010161C]
Are you Hapti's beloved?

Id: [0x0010161F]
That is it! Please, take it to Vitruvius!

Id: [0x0010162E]
Oh Medjay, you really saved my skin.

Id: [0x00101631]
Bayek! Work is progressing well now I have my dioptra back.

Id: [0x00101636]
I miss you. Hapi protects me in The Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00101637]
The gods made me a martyr.

Id: [0x00101638]
When Flavius and Septimius killed me, I knew you would seek vengeance for me seni.

Id: [0x00101639]
The farm you came from, I saw what Flavius did. How he sucked the life from our people.

Id: [0x0010163A]
My mother Nenet? Is she alright?

Id: [0x0010163B]
Yes. Praxilla took her to Balagrae.

Id: [0x00101640]
What's the fuss, my friend?

Id: [0x00101647]
Shall we continue, my friend?

Id: [0x0010164B]
Recover the formula and I will destroy it. I will not have the immolation of Egypt on my conscience. Jove protect you. Bayek.

Id: [0x0010164F]
Ptolemy's men are breaking through our line!

Id: [0x00101650]
The die is cast. Come, we go to the battlefield! Medjay, cover the retreat.

Id: [0x00101653]
All have found themselves dead by her blade.

Id: [0x00101659]
A second chamber? Interesting.

Id: [0x00101697]
I am not a Phylakitai. I am a Medjay.

Id: [0x00101699]
And where is she now?

Id: [0x0010169A]
I have a very powerful friend. Apollodorus. No doubt you have heard of him.

Id: [0x0010169B]
I have not.

Id: [0x0010169C]
You will. In any case, he made a hiding place available to Aya after she ran into trouble.

Id: [0x0010169F]
I must get back. Good luck, my friend! Come visit me at the theatre! There are many things to do in Alexandria!

Id: [0x001016A1]
Now, my younger son, Icarius, has gone off towards the shore, chasing after those blue demons. I fear he'll join his brother!

Id: [0x001016A2]
We came to mourn our hero, and now my family is destroyed! Please, Medjay, save my last son! Don't let his life end today!

Id: [0x001016A3]
Go back to your home. Try to rest. I will find him and bring him back to you.

Id: [0x001016A4]
I do, they were not given the respect they were due.

Id: [0x001016A6]
This is as far as I go. The way to Aya is found in the monument ahead.

Id: [0x001016AC]
I earned my freedom through sweat and blood in the arena, not fleeing like a coward.

Id: [0x001016AE]
Shame you threw it into the river. Could have sold it for coin.

Id: [0x001016AF]
No! I'll give no respect to that bastard Icarus or the blasted Greens. Better to curse them in the upcoming races.

Id: [0x001016B0]
Julius Caesar?

Id: [0x001016BA]
The merchant did not want me to see this part of the shop.

Id: [0x001016BC]
Fight me!

Id: [0x001016BD]
I am a champion!

Id: [0x001016C3]
Egypt will not burn today.

Id: [0x001016C4]
The scrolls of Romulus are included, Brutus.

Id: [0x001016C5]
We have a lot of work ahead of us. All of Egypt needs to be informed, not just Rome.

Id: [0x001016C7]
We are almost done. Keep packing.

Id: [0x001016CA]
[humming a pirate's shanty]

Id: [0x001016D0]
Our city will not be conquered!

Id: [0x001016D1]
Return the palace to Egypt!

Id: [0x001016D2]
Traitors in the palace!

Id: [0x001016D5]
Fortuna smile on you, Vitruvius. Your work will help a lot of people in Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x001016DB]
I dealt with it. Nothing will haunt you now, living or dead.

Id: [0x001016DC]
Can we ransom him back to his family? They looked wealthy.

Id: [0x001016DD]
Great idea! We'll send a message to his mother that if she doesn't pay his weight in drachma, he'll be joining his namesake in the mud.

Id: [0x001016E2]
A fertility talisman. Taimhotep will be pleased.

Id: [0x001016E4]
Hahah! But for now let's drink!

Id: [0x001016F0]
This is uncertain country. Why not bring more guards?

Id: [0x001016F1]
My ritual must remain private.

Id: [0x001016F2]
The lack of a son lowers my husband in the esteem of the people.

Id: [0x001016F3]
They threw it in the river to defile it and bring a curse upon the Prasina Green racers. We need it!

Id: [0x001016F4]
Let me get you to your mother first…

Id: [0x001016F5]
No! You must retrieve it before it is lost for good, or else my mother will never recover from her despair!

Id: [0x001016F7]
Let's get you where you belong.

Id: [0x00101716]
And if they knew of the babes I have lost, his ability to compel the gods would be called into question.

Id: [0x00101717]
There are whispers against him already. My troubles bring shame to him, and to me.

Id: [0x0010171B]
Help me, Bayek!

Id: [0x0010171C]
I will not die like this.

Id: [0x0010172F]
For Siwa!

Id: [0x00101731]
Egypt will not be your lapdog!

Id: [0x00101733]
My gods... 

Id: [0x00101734]
One of the men is posing as a woman. Must be to infiltrate the palace. 

Id: [0x00101735]
They're going to set fire to the palace to cause a panic.

Id: [0x00101736]
The Bowman will be ready to pick Cleopatra off in the confusion. Somewhere high...

Id: [0x00101737]
I have to find them before they strike. 

Id: [0x0010173B]
Bayek! Our region has been a safer place since the General's stranglehold was loosened.

Id: [0x00101740]
I dread to think what Agrippa will do with my weapon, please hurry.

Id: [0x0010177F]
All who ally with monsters and demons will die, General.

Id: [0x0010178B]
Amosis?

Id: [0x0010178C]
Yes? Fresh cockles and mussels today!

Id: [0x0010178E]
Dear Venator, I have included the drachma for your pleasure-rampage.  Remember to maintain confidentiality.  The Gabiniani name still means something as we ascend to the throne.  Pay your men for the assassination and return to meet me in Alexandria.  Our navy could use a good warrior to bolster our coming war with the Romans.  The Order of Ancients is strong, soon enough peace and order will be our gift to the people of Egypt.  Signed, Septimius.

Id: [0x0010178F]
Impact blood stains. These men were indeed as violent as the twins said

Id: [0x00101790]
Sniff sniff... Perfume. Jewelry.... and women's clothes. The twins never mentioned a woman here.

Id: [0x00101791]
and I thought I had a lot of bows. The limbs are strained to the point of snapping.

Id: [0x00101792]
Practice shots? Inside? On a bust of Cleopatra.... Subtle guys. Subtle.

Id: [0x00101793]
Oil.... and lots of it! Smuggled in in wine containers. 

Id: [0x00101794]
What a pig sty! Fucking animals...

Id: [0x00101798]
Those pretty dresses will make good gifts for my wife!

Id: [0x00101799]
Stay behind me. If I fall, get to open ground.

Id: [0x0010179A]
Is that also why we travel off the main road?

Id: [0x0010179B]
Yes. It is less safe, but more secret.

Id: [0x0010179C]
Let's be quiet now, in case our voices carry to unfriendly ears.

Id: [0x0010179D]
Who are those men?

Id: [0x0010179E]
Trouble.

Id: [0x001017A2]
The danger has passed.

Id: [0x001017A3]
For now.

Id: [0x001017A4]
The world outside the walls of the Great Temple is an ugly one.

Id: [0x001017A5]
You have no idea.

Id: [0x001017A6]
Nebet, it is not your fault--

Id: [0x001017A7]
Hush, Mara. I know you mean to be kind, but the scrolls are clear.

Id: [0x001017A8]
The woman is the carrier of the child's sex.

Id: [0x001017A9]
I do not believe that, nebet.

Id: [0x001017AA]
(sighs) Mara… we have had this conversation before.

Id: [0x001017AB]
Good idea.

Id: [0x001017AF]
We are here.

Id: [0x001017B0]
My sword stands between your ritual and any who threaten it.

Id: [0x001017B1]
Ptah's blessing on you.

Id: [0x001017B3]
These goods must be stolen.

Id: [0x001017B4]
[shrieks]

Id: [0x001017B5]
Wow, Medjays used to come here all the time, but not recently. Who do you work for then?

Id: [0x001017B6]
Cleopatra.

Id: [0x001017B7]
I would like to speak with your legendary twins.

Id: [0x001017BA]
"Speaking" is what you call it? I suppose we all have our thing. The twins are going to cost you, if you want to speak or anything else with them, Medjay.

Id: [0x001017BE]
I love you too Pliny.

Id: [0x001017BF]
I never want to leave you. Come with me to Alexandria.

Id: [0x001017C0]
One day.

Id: [0x001017C2]
Which one of you claims to be Venator!

Id: [0x001017C3]
He is our leader, and you will not get to him!

Id: [0x001017C4]
Oh, please!

Id: [0x001017C6]
That takes care of these thugs. Yet no Venator.

Id: [0x001017C7]
Appears those Gabinianis left us a felucca, kind of them.

Id: [0x001017C9]
We must serve greatness. What greatness do we serve now?

Id: [0x001017CA]
We are parents.

Id: [0x001017CB]
We were parents.

Id: [0x001017CD]
Death hangs in the air.

Id: [0x001017CE]
The stench is great. Getting familiar with rotten flesh.

Id: [0x001017CF]
Osiris will be busy.

Id: [0x001017D1]
Are we expecting a delivery?

Id: [0x001017D2]
You are lost? Turn your felucca back and row slowly away!

Id: [0x001017D3]
No sudden movements either! Just row slowly away!

Id: [0x001017D4]
Who are you? No boats in here! This area is closed.

Id: [0x001017D6]
Finally some action in this dark cavern, let's kill these trespassers!

Id: [0x001017E0]
None pass here without escort or a royal seal.

Id: [0x001017E1]
We are with the Great Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII, his envoys from the east, with gifts for your Imperator.

Id: [0x001017E2]
I am the Nomarch of Heliopolis, these are my Phylakitai. We bring gifts from our local merchants.

Id: [0x001017E3]
A carpet? Some wine. No lions and cheetah skins?

Id: [0x001017E4]
They are unarmed.

Id: [0x001017E5]
Let them pass, with an escort.

Id: [0x001017E6]
Is our Queen alright?

Id: [0x001017E7]
I'm fine.

Id: [0x001017E8]
Who are we?

Id: [0x001017E9]
Let me do the talking.

Id: [0x001017F2]
This way. Our Imperator appreciates the hospitality.

Id: [0x001017F3]
Have you received the warm welcome our Pharaohs always provide?

Id: [0x001017F4]
We will not celebrate until an alliance is sealed. Your vizier and your King have given us fine accommodations here in the palace.

Id: [0x001017F5]
However I cannot guarantee my Imperator will hold court with you.

Id: [0x001017F6]
We understand, you are a good legionary. We will be patient.

Id: [0x001017F7]
Do you think we could take them all?

Id: [0x001017F8]
Of course. We have better gods than them.

Id: [0x001017F9]
Are we there yet?

Id: [0x001017FA]
Would you like me to help you carry your carpet?

Id: [0x001017FB]
No, sorry, it is very sacred. Must be handled by, the phylakitai. They understand the merchandise.

Id: [0x001017FC]
Who are you passing with?

Id: [0x001017FD]
They are part of the Pharaoh's administration.

Id: [0x00101816]
Wine casks, this doesn't smell like wine though. Oil in wine casks? Enough oil to burn down the whole city.

Id: [0x0010181D]
I fear the Queen was right, Venator is plotting. Hm... but I need more information. Something is missing.

Id: [0x0010181E]
I need to find where the mummies are being shipped. This tannery must have a dock nearby.

Id: [0x00101822]
Damn you priest! I have no choice. Nek!

Id: [0x00101827]
Ibi! You're far from Siwa my friend.

Id: [0x00101828]
Yes, Medjay. I could not stay there after what happened. I cried for the people we left behind.

Id: [0x00101829]
He filled her heart with rebellion. Convinced her to help him cut out the Roman canker growing in our world. They were captured attacking the fort.

Id: [0x0010182E]
Silphion should help the people, not fat patricians in Rome.

Id: [0x0010182F]
You'll be begging us to kill you.

Id: [0x00101840]
Tell Severus from me, he's the legion's best cocksucker. All the guards say so.

Id: [0x0010184C]
Yes. The captain of the Prasinos camp, Severus, is a psychotic butcher. Every day finding new, sick ways to inflict suffering on our people.

Id: [0x0010184E]
Then I will kill the torturer, Apate.

Id: [0x00101858]
Captain! We bested them! The Gabiniani are finished!

Id: [0x00101859]
Don't be hasty, boy! My spies gave me a greater number than that. They must have split their fleet. We should head east.

Id: [0x0010185A]
Straight into the jaws of the crocodile, if your spies tell the truth.

Id: [0x0010185B]
Hahaha! What of it? I've wrestled more fearsome beasts!

Id: [0x0010185C]
And none were a match for our Captain!

Id: [0x0010185D]
Your bravado will be your undoing, Captain. And ours!

Id: [0x00101860]
Where are these mongrel Gabiniani? My informant assured me they would pass here. I'll throttle his scrawny neck if he told me wrong.

Id: [0x00101861]
Who are the Gabiniani? Where do they come from?

Id: [0x00101862]
Exiles of Rome who took Egypt as their home. Traitorous rats every one, with the discipline of Rome and the ruthlessness of Ptolemy. Worthy opponents for the likes of us!

Id: [0x00101863]
Well, we have to stop them before they can join Ptolemy's fleet.

Id: [0x00101864]
We'll find them, Aya, and send them to ruin. Not one of the salt soaked hull rats will pass us alive. What say you, shield boy?

Id: [0x00101865]
We are with you, Captain! Alala!

Id: [0x00101870]
The way they spring from the fog. It is like a nightmare!

Id: [0x00101871]
Pah! Don't let their tricks trouble you, Damastes! It's a ruse to shake our nerve. They gain nothing by it.

Id: [0x00101872]
And the flames! Their fire is intense!

Id: [0x00101873]
Phoxidas! This weapon could really help our cause.

Id: [0x00101874]
I might know someone who knows someone. We could make it happen.

Id: [0x00101875]
Keep inside the range of their catapults, and the day is ours!

Id: [0x00101876]
Let us finish this!

Id: [0x0010187B]
How can one hope to tame such as exotic creature as an Egyptian woman? I will tame anything.

Id: [0x0010187C]
[Sigh] Sehetep and I found faith together, joined the temple together. I knew he struggled, just as I did but… I have to stop him now.

Id: [0x00101880]
Find that shit eater. I will round up what's left of the freedom fighters.

Id: [0x00101895]
The Legion is losing it's greatest neket iadet, Severus.

Id: [0x001018A2]
I prostrate myself before you Apollo Phoebus, bringer of light. For I am your servant.

Id: [0x001018A3]
Away, away with the wicked!

Id: [0x001018A4]
Golden is Apollo's mantle and golden is its clasp.

Id: [0x001018A5]
The enemies of Rome will fall before us bright one. I will punish them for you and the huntress.

Id: [0x001018A9]
For the Medjay! For Cyrenaica!

Id: [0x001018AA]
Do or die!

Id: [0x001018AB]
That butcher Severus must not live!

Id: [0x001018DD]
I will not betray the black land, despots!

Id: [0x001018EC]
Poor Ruia. If you had only known how to make such a leap... What did you get yourself into?

Id: [0x001018ED]
Beasts with the faces of men prey on the weak and powerless. We cannot simply show our bellies to the jackals that plague our land.

Id: [0x001018FD]
I cannot leave you here. I will take you back to Pelias for the proper rites.

Id: [0x001018FE]
That Futuo Sminthos! He's tainting our market with his worthless tat.

Id: [0x00101907]
Diocles! It's a trap! Leander is attempting a coup!

Id: [0x00101911]
You are truly a blessing sent from the gods! We will make an offering to Icarus and the Prasina green in your name!

Id: [0x00101912]
We will. Come, mother. We have to prepare to deal with my brother's funeral.

Id: [0x00101913]
Yes, of course. At least he is glad that the bust of Icarus was restored.

Id: [0x00101917]
I have been praying so often, my priest said I should relax.

Id: [0x00101918]
By Anubis. This place has been busy. Venator doesn't work alone.

Id: [0x00101926]
I hate drawing guard duty.

Id: [0x00101927]
Me too, but at least we still get an equal share of the spoils. And we're promised a spot on the next raid.

Id: [0x0010192F]
You are a Medjay!

Id: [0x00101930]
Yes! I must hurry home. The war chief, Fat Homer, took the Hungry Great Ones on a raid!

Id: [0x00101931]
You move like a lion! Would you help me stop them?

Id: [0x00101942]
No! The Hungry Great Ones are going to kill us all!

Id: [0x00101944]
Where is our protector!? Why have the gods abandoned us!?

Id: [0x00101946]
Run! Run or else you'll be taken by the Hungry Great ones!

Id: [0x0010194E]
I cannot believe it, the gods protected us!

Id: [0x00101950]
Amazing! Meketre has been returned to us! Did you see him drive away the bandits?

Id: [0x00101952]
Meketre is alive! And he killed Fat Homer! The gods love us!

Id: [0x00101953]
Enough bows here to start a small war.

Id: [0x00101964]
Can't believe some puss-filled wart of a Medjay has been killing our men.

Id: [0x00101965]
I heard he killed the archers Sefetu left in Sais.

Id: [0x00101966]
That and more. When Sefetu catches him I heard he's going to burn his fingers and toes off, then his ears, nose, tongue, balls.

Id: [0x00101967]
Sweet Serapis…

Id: [0x00101968]
They don't call him the Firebrand for no good reason. Don't screw up.

Id: [0x00101969]
Yeah.

Id: [0x00101977]
A bird shape knife... the one Rudjek dropped, trying to escape his faith.

Id: [0x00101978]
A gruesome but fitting end.

Id: [0x00101979]
Someone's been at work here. These were made over the last year.

Id: [0x0010197A]
I left you to rot and yet someone seeked to honor you. This will not do.

Id: [0x0010197C]
The Roman hag who did this leaves by boat for Alexandria today.

Id: [0x001019DE]
This tomb has been disturbed since I last came... Whatever happened to the body?

Id: [0x00101A03]
That is why I'm here. Any idea where they went?

Id: [0x00101A04]
The ancient temple of Alexander the Great, maybe? That is the one I was telling them about. It is northwest of here.

Id: [0x00101A05]
It's been a while. They might have gone west, to Theos Elpis Rift. We have a camp there.

Id: [0x00101A06]
Very well. I will scour the temple area, you head for the camp.

Id: [0x00101A4D]
Osiris' wife Iset searched and found all the pieces except one.

Id: [0x00101A4E]
She still protects against poisonous animals. But not love. Against that there is no protection, not even the gods can.

Id: [0x00101A4F]
The Pharaoh finds this calf, and worships it.

Id: [0x00101A50]
You are the child of both Egypt and Greece. You're proof they don't hate each other.

Id: [0x00101A51]
To Egyptians they are he-goats that rise from the underworld, bringing pestilence and protection. Even the gods have two sides.

Id: [0x00101A52]
Like mom says, "May your victories multiply!"

Id: [0x00101A53]
Yes, Khemu.

Id: [0x00101A54]
And the Pharaoh is Horus, right?

Id: [0x00101A55]
Ma'at will decide if we're worthy to walk together in the Field of Reeds. I'm sure you will though. Your ka is good.

Id: [0x00101A56]
But this… is something not even the gods can tell. You will have to ask a goddess.

Id: [0x00101A57]
Mistress of the West, she welcomes the dead to the afterlife.

Id: [0x00101A58]
Lord of the shadows and the silence, he comes at the voice of the poor. He hears the confessions of the humble, and forgives them.

Id: [0x00101A60]
Bayek of Siwa! Your hunt continues, we have more, the Jackal, the Lion. The Order of Ancients grows.

Id: [0x00101A61]
Killing is an art form. Not to be indulged, but to be woven and crafted.

Id: [0x00101A62]
Pharaohs made chariots, brought gods into human hearts, our divinity is to be protected by the Medjay.

Id: [0x00101A65]
May you walk in the land of the Duat. Sobek be merciful to you. Ma'at find you worthy…

Id: [0x00101A66]
Dua Sobek. Sobek the healer. He of the green plumage. The splashing one who came from the great goddess of sunlight… Forgive our weaknesses…

Id: [0x00101A6E]
I have a fierce desire to get back to Sais.

Id: [0x00101A6F]
Sais? It's a sleepy little nothing of a town.

Id: [0x00101A70]
Sure, it's pissant compared to Alexandria. But it also means you can go without an officer looking over your shoulder.

Id: [0x00101A76]
Last time I was in Sais, I think I overdid it.

Id: [0x00101A77]
Huh? What do you mean?

Id: [0x00101A79]
Sefetu's got the people so cowed you can do whatever you want. Eat their food, screw their women, hell, kill their men, and no one will raise a voice against you.

Id: [0x00101A7A]
Stick with me, kid. I'll show you how it's done.

Id: [0x00101A7B]
Hahah. Cannot wait!

Id: [0x00101A7C]
We cannot harvest the crops, nor can we put the dead to rest with the hippos in our fields.

Id: [0x00101A81]
Relax and just enjoy the quiet time.

Id: [0x00101A82]
I guess.

Id: [0x00101A8E]
Say…

Id: [0x00101A8F]
Here we go.

Id: [0x00101A90]
No, no, it's a good idea. What if we caught some baby hippos and trained them for war? Can you imagine some stupid farmer's face when we come roaring out of the river riding on the backs of hippos!

Id: [0x00101A91]
Can you imagine your face when a hippo rips it off?

Id: [0x00101A92]
You never believe in my ideas!

Id: [0x00101A99]
I will cut you up and scatter your pieces as an offering to the Great One!

Id: [0x00101AA1]
I will sing songs of our battle to my aunt to remember this day.

Id: [0x00101AA2]
Ha.

Id: [0x00101AAD]
(crying)

Id: [0x00101AB0]
Help me feed her to the crocodiles one piece at a time.

Id: [0x00101AB5]
Ho! We did it! Now Philocrates will shed bitter tears in the Hippodrome.

Id: [0x00101AB7]
Sure, sure. Where's the payment from the Blues?

Id: [0x00101AB8]
We'll get it soon.

Id: [0x00101AB9]
You trust them to pay us?

Id: [0x00101ABA]
If they don't we'll steal their horses, too.

Id: [0x00101AD2]
You saved my felucca! Here, take this as a small token of thanks.

Id: [0x00101ADE]
Take Bayel and some men and track down the bastards that stole Saganaki!

Id: [0x00101AE0]
We must be getting close.

Id: [0x00101AE1]
For Icarus! For Prasina Green!

Id: [0x00101AE2]
For the Green!

Id: [0x00101AE4]
How many bandits do you think there are?

Id: [0x00101AE5]
Do not worry. We have the Medjay with us. We will be fine.

Id: [0x00101AE7]
Who are these bandits?

Id: [0x00101AE8]
Scum who are working for the blues, I'm sure.

Id: [0x00101AEA]
Have you heard about the Great Hungry Ones?

Id: [0x00101AEB]
Who are they?

Id: [0x00101AEC]
Bandits down south. I think they ride war hippos.

Id: [0x00101AED]
What? Are you serious?

Id: [0x00101AEE]
So I've heard.

Id: [0x00101AF6]
What happened here?

Id: [0x00101AF7]
The garrison soldiers are brutal. If they suspect a villager is lying to them, they burn his neighborhood. And worse.

Id: [0x00101AF8]
No one in the [wahat](oasis) can make a move without being questioned, threatened, taxed or beaten.

Id: [0x00101AF9]
We all have learned to obey and keep our heads down.

Id: [0x00101AFB]
You see how it is.

Id: [0x00101AFC]
Let's not attract attention.

Id: [0x00101B05]
Ptolemy wants the entire region kept under heel. I do my best to keep the villagers out of trouble. I could use your help.

Id: [0x00101B07]
Before, they got drunk and fought with the villagers. Now that Medunamun is here, they are disciplined and vicious.

Id: [0x00101B0F]
Pothinus is still angry about the furnishings.

Id: [0x00101B10]
The chairs are of the finest Cypriot wood!

Id: [0x00101B11]
Yes, but the pillows, dear Phraxus. What of the pillows?

Id: [0x00101B22]
Have you prepared the various treaties?

Id: [0x00101B23]
I have.

Id: [0x00101B24]
I'd like to have a look. Especially the one meant for Herod.

Id: [0x00101B25]
He's a slippery one.

Id: [0x00101B32]
Eudoros is here again.

Id: [0x00101B33]
I pity him. His skin affliction is an endless source of discomfort.

Id: [0x00101B34]
I suspect he comes here principally to ogle naked boys!

Id: [0x00101B35]
As do we all!

Id: [0x00101B4A]
Ptolemy is a chinless simpleton.

Id: [0x00101B4B]
Simonides, you have consumed too much wine!

Id: [0x00101B4C]
I have, and I will again. But had I not, would our pharaoh be any less a goose?

Id: [0x00101B4D]
There are worse things than dying. Be careful.

Id: [0x00101B51]
Beware, beware. The Thermae are closed there has been a terrible and bloody murder.

Id: [0x00101B61]
A murder at the baths? And it's barely a week since that trained brute escaped.

Id: [0x00101B62]
Did you know the victim?

Id: [0x00101B63]
That odious old money lender, I heard someone cut off his cock!

Id: [0x00101B6B]
Apollo showed his fertile city to Battos... and like a raven led the people of Battos to Libya.

Id: [0x00101B6D]
Hie Paian, Hie Paian!

Id: [0x00101B6E]
Oh, thee who sits on the right hand of Zeus. Grant me a wife of good repute and even better looks.

Id: [0x00101B6F]
How Apollo's laurel sapling shakes! How the whole temple shakes! Away, away with the wicked!

Id: [0x00101B70]
Livia loves Esio, Livia loves Esio.

Id: [0x00101B71]
I do not! I hate you, Kelpia, I hate you!

Id: [0x00101B73]
We cannot do it alone, we need Faiyum.

Id: [0x00101B75]
Ra will ensure your crops are fertile seni.

Id: [0x00101B79]
Ugly-wiggly Pigface, sitting in the bog. Hiding all the acorns, what a fat old hog.

Id: [0x00101B7B]
Don't you think Esio is the best? He's so brave and fearless.

Id: [0x00101B7C]
I am sick of him bossing us around!

Id: [0x00101B7D]
You're just jealous, you stupid cludus! Because he can touch his nose with his tongue.

Id: [0x00101B86]
How delicious, such unspeakable savagery within our own walls!

Id: [0x00101B88]
It is the only way inside this arena. Fight in the streets and a gladiator can bring you in.

Id: [0x00101B89]
But I managed to get a sword and make my escape. I travelled here, where Felix took me in and trained me.

Id: [0x00101B8A]
Yes, yes. Let us split the sun in two with our swords.

Id: [0x00101B8E]
Zeus, giver of every gift, white-bearded father of the Pantheon. You who dwellest within the stygian firmament…

Id: [0x00101B90]
I give you libations of wine and honey, Zeus. Send me a son of my own that I may cherish him.

Id: [0x00101B95]
They will build monuments and scrawl our names across temples after this.

Id: [0x00101B96]
We will be adored! Rich! And champions.

Id: [0x00101B97]
Zeus! Will I ever chant your name, thy power praise!

Id: [0x00101B9C]
What's the Egyptian doing, jumping into the sacred pools?

Id: [0x00101B9E]
Getting wet and making a fool of himself!

Id: [0x00101B9F]
It's unsanitary! Go to the thermae if you need to wash!

Id: [0x00101BA5]
Let us in, let us see the Founder!

Id: [0x00101BA6]
The centurion had no right!

Id: [0x00101BA7]
Battos' rest must not be disturbed!

Id: [0x00101BA8]
These Roman scum have no respect for our laws!

Id: [0x00101BAE]
Great founder, he who Apollo bade build this shining city.

Id: [0x00101BAF]
Apollo told King Battos ‘this is the place for you to settle in, for here there is a hole in the sky.

Id: [0x00101BB0]
Battos' watch over Cyrene and grant us prosperity.

Id: [0x00101BB1]
So he guards the bow and the medallion so the walls of our great City shall not fall.

Id: [0x00101BB5]
Iakchos does a lot for the poor unfortunates, feeds them, gives them shelter in the temple.

Id: [0x00101BB6]
He even helped that red-headed cludus.

Id: [0x00101BB7]
That swindler! It's a miracle he's not dead in a ditch with a dagger in his back.

Id: [0x00101BBC]
I am the great Polymestor! The Bear of Thrace. Prepare to die enemies of Cyrene!

Id: [0x00101BBD]
Why are you always the bear? I want to be the bear.

Id: [0x00101BC3]
They say Polymestor is a murderous fiend, that he escaped because his lust for blood couldn't be quenched in the arena.

Id: [0x00101BC4]
I gave the Lanista five-hundred drachma. For an hour alone with him, my Thracian bear.

Id: [0x00101BC5]
No! What was he like?

Id: [0x00101BC6]
I couldn't walk for a week.

Id: [0x00101BC7]
I'm his biggest fan, I've seen him fight a thousand times.

Id: [0x00101BC9]
The bear he strikes them with his paws. The bear he guts them with his claws.

Id: [0x00101BDB]
Polymestor ran off with the Lanista's sword. He's livid!

Id: [0x00101BDC]
That rusty old thing? He's always going on about how Caesar gave it to him.

Id: [0x00101BDD]
Caesar my arse. He bought it off that crook Sminthos!

Id: [0x00101BDF]
Try your fortune at the arena against the greatest fighters in the Republic.

Id: [0x00101BE0]
By what authority do you enter here?

Id: [0x00101BE1]
Take them down, men!

Id: [0x00101BE3]
What do have we here? Intruders?

Id: [0x00101BE4]
Slaughter them!

Id: [0x00101BED]
Yes, you're right. He would. I should thank you for this gift.

Id: [0x00101BEE]
Yet more ships! From the east!

Id: [0x00101BEF]
Hades' balls! This must be the full count of these bastards. There! Gods and piss! This is it slackers! We win or we die! Alalala!

Id: [0x00101BF0]
Prepare to evade!

Id: [0x00101BF1]
Aya! Damastes! Slackers all! Listen to me!

Id: [0x00101BF2]
Scribes will break their pens writing of this day, on this blood smeared ocean, we'll send these cursed Gabiniani to the Underworld! Let's see them tell that story without tears running down their face!

Id: [0x00101BF3]
The gods themselves will lift cups to our glory!

Id: [0x00101BF4]
Steady old man! Let's not bait the gods! Strike oars!

Id: [0x00101BF5]
Victory! By Amun, well done all!

Id: [0x00101BF6]
Alalalalala!

Id: [0x00101BF7]
And that is the game! Alalalalala!

Id: [0x00101C07]
There!

Id: [0x00101C08]
Is that their whole fleet?

Id: [0x00101C09]
Poseidon's piss no, woman! That's only part of their full strength, and the lesser part by the looks. Triremes only. There's no sign of their damned Octareme.

Id: [0x00101C0A]
Strike oars and ready your bows! We attack!

Id: [0x00101C0B]
Give no quarter men! These devils will give us none!

Id: [0x00101C0C]
They have an Octareme? How will we face it?

Id: [0x00101C0D]
Show no fear, Damastes! They've not met our kind before. Their bloated barge won't save them.

Id: [0x00101C0E]
That's two down!

Id: [0x00101C0F]
There's one more yet for Poseidon's collection!

Id: [0x00101C10]
Alright Medjay. You win. This way.

Id: [0x00101C12]
Go do your hero work.

Id: [0x00101C13]
Be safe, Tuaa.

Id: [0x00101C14]
Go save the world, Medjay.

Id: [0x00101C33]
That Mouse is always sniffing around here.

Id: [0x00101C34]
He sold me a potion, said it would make Quintus fall madly in love with me.

Id: [0x00101C35]
And, did it?

Id: [0x00101C36]
Gave him the shits for a week. Now he won't even speak to me! That rodent ruined my life!

Id: [0x00101C39]
You see that Mouse?

Id: [0x00101C3A]
Yeah, they say that just looking at him can bring you a year of bad luck.

Id: [0x00101C3B]
My second cousin once bought some ointment from that Sminthos and the next day her cat disappeared!

Id: [0x00101C3E]
The magistrates should do something about that Mouse.

Id: [0x00101C3F]
Clear the filthy vermin off the streets.

Id: [0x00101C40]
This man was pinned down and died in the blaze. The structure is badly damaged. I cannot go any further.

Id: [0x00101C47]
The trail leads outwards. I should look around the courtyard.

Id: [0x00101C52]
Septimius is in town, his main Phylakes is a man named Venator. We heard rumours he is lurking around the brothel.

Id: [0x00101C53]
I will clean this town up. And ensure our safety.

Id: [0x00101C56]
My plan is to rename this temple in my name. Is the town safe yet?

Id: [0x00101C57]
I got busy and distracted. It is a beautiful region.

Id: [0x00101C58]
Any luck? Enjoy the brothel? Time is of the essence, if we want to catch Septimius.

Id: [0x00101C59]
I am working on it.

Id: [0x00101C5C]
Venator, Venator, where are you?

Id: [0x00101C5E]
This place smells like a swamp. Broken dishes, it reeks of foul play.

Id: [0x00101C60]
Blood on the walls. This Venator is sick. What have you and your men been up to?

Id: [0x00101C63]
Why do they call him the bear?

Id: [0x00101C66]
I saw the graffiti, looks like you have a problem.

Id: [0x00101C69]
Target practice on Cleopatra? Venator is training his Gabinianis for an assassination.

Id: [0x00101C6C]
Lutes, lipstick and scented oils. Were women of the street here?

Id: [0x00101C6E]
And Roman regalia. Odd. Seems Venator wants his men to mix well.

Id: [0x00101C74]
I should check the docks, high points and go back to the brothel. This town is crawling with neket iadets.

Id: [0x00101C86]
Watch your tone. My father's a Greek.

Id: [0x00101C87]
Oh, really? Then I have some cats to sell him.

Id: [0x00101C88]
Shut up and get back to work.

Id: [0x00101C8C]
Jump! Jump, Bayek.

Id: [0x00101C8D]
We're watching!

Id: [0x00101C8E]
Go on!

Id: [0x00101C8F]
Any time now!

Id: [0x00101C94]
Go!

Id: [0x00101C95]
Jump!

Id: [0x00101CA9]
Yes! Head to the baths!

Id: [0x00101CAB]
The top of the Baths?! That's a death sentence!

Id: [0x00101CAC]
Sure Esio, I could do that with my eyes closed.

Id: [0x00101CB6]
Flying on their right, and he swore to our king to grant them walls. Apollo's oath is forever valued. Oh Apollo!

Id: [0x00101CB7]
Your third foundation was the town of Cyrene and we built you there a fine palace in the city. Be silent and hear the songs of Apollo's glory.

Id: [0x00101CBC]
Wooh! He will surely be killed up there!

Id: [0x00101CC1]
Keep going... Keep going. Gods watch over fools.

Id: [0x00101CC7]
The Greeks are learning what it feels like to be Egyptian, have your land, your dead and your relics desecrated by an invading force.

Id: [0x00101CCA]
The ka is gone! So few Egyptians are coming to temple! Where are my seni and senu!

Id: [0x00101CCB]
So sad to see the Sarapeion so quiet!

Id: [0x00101CCD]
Stealing from Serapis? You guards are supposed to uphold the law. Pathetic.

Id: [0x00101CD7]
That stink on the wind… Another of Memphis's curses.

Id: [0x00101CD8]
Aya's nose is finer than mine. She could uncover the origin of the smell in a moment.

Id: [0x00101CDD]
Hail, Pure One.

Id: [0x00101CDE]
May your heart be joyful, Medjay.

Id: [0x00101CE0]
I am here to discuss Pasherenptah's complaint on the Informant Table.

Id: [0x00101CE2]
Joy is scarce while Memphis chokes on the scent of the grave.

Id: [0x00101CE3]
Indeed! We seek a capable person to investigate this tomb.

Id: [0x00101CE4]
But demons would fear a priest. Why not investigate yourself?

Id: [0x00101CE6]
Most are too fearful of the demons within to enter.

Id: [0x00101CEB]
What is going to happen to that stupid stuttering Greek inside?

Id: [0x00101CEC]
He's going to be sacrificed to Wadjet when the Caretaker gets here.

Id: [0x00101CED]
Blood sacrifice? The priests stopped that years ago.

Id: [0x00101CEE]
Our ancestors followed the true path, before it was corrupted by false teaching. That's why Wadjet abandoned us to the bastard Greeks.

Id: [0x00101CEF]
Well, at least he won't escape. You beat him so badly he's lying in his own blood. He can't even stand.

Id: [0x00101CF0]
Ha-ha! Stupid Greek. He had it coming. He hasn't even started to bleed yet. Wait till the Caretaker gets to him.

Id: [0x00101CF5]
The Caretaker's hideout must be up ahead.

Id: [0x00101CF9]
For the rarest and most exotic goods in Cyrene talk to the Mouse.

Id: [0x00101CFA]
Everything was flowing. Wine, women, boys...

Id: [0x00101CFB]
Ipthos lost his toga!

Id: [0x00101CFC]
Urgh...

Id: [0x00101D06]
Did you find anything at Leander's villa?

Id: [0x00101D07]
So the evidence is there, I just need to take it.

Id: [0x00101D08]
And if that someone were to find anything they could meet me here, and I'd be happy to help.

Id: [0x00101D09]
…wielding still the flashing stroke of lightning. Scatter, O Father, the darkness from our souls.

Id: [0x00101D0A]
He's watching, he's waiting, be careful how you tread. Or he'll call upon an eagle and spirit you to bed.

Id: [0x00101D0B]
I can tell you about my home, the most amazing city of Cyrene as we go?

Id: [0x00101D0C]
Without it construction has stalled on the aqueduct. The General's idiots believe my workers are to blame.

Id: [0x00101D0E]
Hmm. A Roman helping Egyptians. This is rare, I should get this dioptra.

Id: [0x00101D0F]
I hate getting my hair wet, don't you Bayek?

Id: [0x00101D10]
So do I, Esio.

Id: [0x00101D11]
Vi… Vitru… well anyway he spent ten thousand drachma on a floor made of little squares.

Id: [0x00101D16]
I have not heard from my son in months.

Id: [0x00101D17]
Your wife said he returned to Egypt?

Id: [0x00101D18]
That is what I told her. Truth is he ran off to join those freedom fighters.

Id: [0x00101D19]
Fools think they can overthrow our 'Roman oppressors'.

Id: [0x00101D23]
If the Soldiers catch him they'll crucify them for sure.

Id: [0x00101D27]
Have you ever seen such wonders! A bridge that carries fresh water across the land.

Id: [0x00101D28]
My brother saw the Pyramids. He says those put these Roman white elephants to shame.

Id: [0x00101D29]
What would he know, those things are ancient. Maybe the gods put them there?

Id: [0x00101D2A]
Men put them there, men like my brother.

Id: [0x00101D2B]
I doubt it your brother is a drunk! He couldn't cut a loaf of bread straight!

Id: [0x00101D2F]
Fun?

Id: [0x00101D30]
He won me a fortune and in return I treated him like a king. The best food, the best whores.

Id: [0x00101D31]
Make the ladies of Cyrene gasp for more while the men curse their lack of manhood. Only the bravest and most brutal survive!

Id: [0x00101D32]
Keep Caesar's sword, it belongs to one who stands for freedom and honor.

Id: [0x00101D33]
That's what happens when you lay with a bull!

Id: [0x00101D34]
Sminthos lay with a bull?

Id: [0x00101D35]
His mother did, and was cursed by Zeus for her depravity.

Id: [0x00101D37]
If that doesn't prove he's cursed nothing does.

Id: [0x00101D3C]
I am a vessel of the gods -- I contribute through prayer.

Id: [0x00101D43]
Holding fenugreek seeds to your nose helps chase the smell.

Id: [0x00101D44]
Oh, I've tried that! And black cumin, coriander, garlic… Nothing works.

Id: [0x00101D45]
The stink is everywhere -- in my clothes, in my food…

Id: [0x00101D46]
My children cry through the night. The smell keeps them awake!

Id: [0x00101D47]
I am glad my family moved to the western quarter last year.

Id: [0x00101D48]
The river breeze provides some relief, at least.

Id: [0x00101D49]
I wish I had the money to move.

Id: [0x00101D4A]
I try to pacify the gods, but they always seem to favor you and ignore me.

Id: [0x00101D4B]
It's your stepmother. Your family will never escape her curse.

Id: [0x00101D4C]
I wish my father had never married her!

Id: [0x00101D51]
The door to the tomb is locked.

Id: [0x00101D52]
You must use one of the minor entrances. They are marked with offerings of incense.

Id: [0x00101D53]
Yes, sealed against the terrors below.

Id: [0x00101D58]
I should look for smoke rising from the incense placed outside the other entrances.

Id: [0x00101D5B]
Gah! I can hardly breathe!

Id: [0x00101D5D]
The source of this poison is closer than before.

Id: [0x00101D63]
The treasure in here better be worth the stink!

Id: [0x00101D64]
It is enough to make a pig cry.

Id: [0x00101D65]
Pinch your nose. You'll be fine.

Id: [0x00101D66]
At least we can be sure no one will bother us down here.

Id: [0x00101D67]
No one who values their ka, anyway.

Id: [0x00101D68]
Do not tell me you're frightened?

Id: [0x00101D69]
Only fools don't fear the gods.

Id: [0x00101D6A]
Only fools believe in them.

Id: [0x00101D6B]
May they forgive me for having a blasphemer like you as a brother.

Id: [0x00101D6C]
Aya feels he is working for the Order, and has a proxy here named Venator.

Id: [0x00101D6D]
Perhaps he is the masked one that forced my son's death upon me.

Id: [0x00101D71]
An offering to chase the smell. Someone has been here recently… someone who does not fear demons.

Id: [0x00101D75]
What in the name of the gods is that foulness? I should trace it to its source.

Id: [0x00101D77]
You only sealed one entrance? Oh, never mind.

Id: [0x00101D7D]
But remember: Cleopatra is a Ptolemy. She is the better of two evils.

Id: [0x00101D85]
Fresh air… A better blessing than that priest's.

Id: [0x00101D89]
Oh, it smells!

Id: [0x00101D8A]
It smells very bad!

Id: [0x00101D8B]
Very bad indeed!

Id: [0x00101D8C]
Worse than bad!

Id: [0x00101D8D]
Worse than… Wait, what could be worse than bad?

Id: [0x00101D8F]
Terrible! Terrible can be worse than bad!

Id: [0x00101D90]
Yes, terrible! A terrible smell!

Id: [0x00101D91]
Is there anything worse than terrible?

Id: [0x00101D92]
Is horrible worse than terrible?

Id: [0x00101D93]
Oh, yes! Horrible is worse!

Id: [0x00101D94]
So is this smell horrible or terrible?

Id: [0x00101D95]
Horrible!

Id: [0x00101D96]
And terrible!

Id: [0x00101D97]
Wait, can it be both?

Id: [0x00101D98]
I don't know!

Id: [0x00101DD8]
I have got burns all over! Although they have been better lately.

Id: [0x00101DDB]
If you are here in the High Priest's name, you must be a man of power.

Id: [0x00101DDE]
Did you say "Lizard"?

Id: [0x00101DDF]
It means something to you?

Id: [0x00101DE0]
I have heard it whispered in taverns. Rumors only.

Id: [0x00101DE1]
If you have nothing of substance to offer, I will be leaving.

Id: [0x00101DE3]
Wait! I can tell you this -- our natron is tainted. It is mixed with sand.

Id: [0x00101DE4]
Go to the warehouse just north of the Great Temple. The gods be with you.

Id: [0x00101DEB]
Let's see what is in this warehouse he mentions.

Id: [0x00101DEC]
So the mummies rotted due to the tainted natron.

Id: [0x00101E04]
Here's the warehouse. I need to be careful.

Id: [0x00101E08]
Do you know why the Head Embalmer has no nose?

Id: [0x00101E09]
Stuck it where it didn't belong, I imagine.

Id: [0x00101E0A]
I heard a crocodile bit it off.

Id: [0x00101E0B]
I heard a lizard bit it off.

Id: [0x00101E0C]
Neket iadet! Don't say that name out loud.

Id: [0x00101E0D]
Why not? There's no one to hear but us.

Id: [0x00101E0E]
You never know who might be listening. I didn't get this far with loose talk.

Id: [0x00101E0F]
"Get this far"? You're digging natron like a common laborer.

Id: [0x00101E10]
If this is where being quiet gets you, I'll stand naked on top of the great temple…

Id: [0x00101E11]
…and shout the Lizard's name to the entire city!

Id: [0x00101E12]
Someone shut him up before he gets us all killed.

Id: [0x00101E17]
I guess some neket iadet was listening after all!

Id: [0x00101E1C]
Memphis's dead will sleep peacefully now.

Id: [0x00101E36]
Can you stand?

Id: [0x00101E3A]
Be still. I will carry you out.

Id: [0x00101E4A]
Wait, what happened to your stutter?

Id: [0x00101E4E]
Look, some of us have built a shrine in a cave under what is left of the great Temple. Why don't you come and honour Wadjet with us? Egyptians have to stick together.

Id: [0x00101E4F]
Maybe I will, after I look around.

Id: [0x00101E5F]
It's your own fault! You've been hiding opium from us! What did you think the Commander would do?

Id: [0x00101E60]
Gentlemen. There is no need for further hostility. You're Mahu right?

Id: [0x00101E62]
The soldiers are not paying you enough. That is going to be tough when your new baby arrives.

Id: [0x00101E64]
Enough! Fine, you can carry on. But remember we have the girl. Any further trouble and she disappears.

Id: [0x00101E66]
A Medjay! I am Meritmaat, the village leader. Ah, do not worry about them. They are just middle men for Ptolemy's soldiers.

Id: [0x00101E67]
I have an understanding with their Commander. Opium and honey for protection of the village. He is the one we have to worry about. [Spits in disgust]

Id: [0x00101E68]
Sounds like they took a hostage?

Id: [0x00101E69]
Hah, just like the Medjay of old! If you want to be a hero, they took her to the nearby military camp. If she still lives you will find her there.

Id: [0x00101E6A]
I will return with her soon, Meritmaat. And then you can decide if I am a hero.

Id: [0x00101E6C]
The Caretaker is using the goddess to kill Greeks. Why such hatred? Aya would be sad. It is just as Nanefer warned through his stutter. Egypt has lost harmony.

Id: [0x00101E73]
By the sound of it, I won't have to find the Caretaker after all. He's already found me.

Id: [0x00101E78]
This must be the kidnapped girl. She is drugged, but still breathing. I have to get her out of here.

Id: [0x00101E7F]
Medjay! I heard you freed the girl.

Id: [0x00101E80]
The Commander was not at the camp. But we should deal with him. Tell me everything you know.

Id: [0x00101E81]
The local soldiers and middle men I can deal with. But the Commander… he's vicious. A murderer. I dare not confront him.

Id: [0x00101E82]
Years ago he took another hostage. My own daughter. There was no Medjay to save us then.

Id: [0x00101E83]
I have got an idea how to get to him. The shipments of opium go along the river. I will follow them, find him, and end your agreement.

Id: [0x00101E84]
Then may Horus guide your blade, Medjay. Sink it deep! Do not be merciful! The Commander is guilty as Set.

Id: [0x00101E85]
I should return to Meritmaat also. I need to talk to her about the Commander.

Id: [0x00101E8C]
How did this all happen?

Id: [0x00101E8D]
We grow honey and opium. They're commodities the army found impossible to ignore.

Id: [0x00101E8E]
At first they tried to take over the village. Some of our men resisted. They were branded rebels and traitors, and hunted down.

Id: [0x00101E90]
Those that weren't killed fled North. Ironically, they joined with the rebels. We send them opium and money whenever we can.

Id: [0x00101E91]
I have made the most of things. Until now I have managed to stop anyone else being taken. But we will never be free while the Commander lives.

Id: [0x00101E92]
Why does the commander tolerate Meritmaat, that old hag? I would have gutted her long ago.

Id: [0x00101E93]
You've heard the way she talks to us!

Id: [0x00101E94]
Yeah! We should abduct more of her children. She'll be much nicer.

Id: [0x00101E95]
There is a sweet smell hanging in the air. Opium. This is the right ship.

Id: [0x00101E96]
A manifest. This ship unloads at Memphis. That is where I will find the Commander.

Id: [0x00101E97]
The murderous neket iadet is dead. But what is this about Meritmaat's daughter? She might still be alive! And right here in Memphis!

Id: [0x00101E98]
The shipment is late. If that old hag has caused the delay, I will kill the hostage and send her the pieces. She will learn again not to defy me!

Id: [0x00101E99]
Greetings nebet. Are you the Commander's daughter?

Id: [0x00101E9A]
I am. May I help you?

Id: [0x00101E9B]
I am the bearer of… strange news. But you must believe me. Your mother still lives.

Id: [0x00101E9C]
My mother? I was abandoned as a child. How could that be? Who are you?

Id: [0x00101E9D]
I have something here you should read.

Id: [0x00101EA0]
I could look for him?

Id: [0x00101EA1]
Excellent! Then I'll petition the other magistrates. Try the tavern, or the brothel southwest of the arena for our wayward friend.

Id: [0x00101EA2]
We'll meet back at my house. It's the only one with a large terrace on the main street.

Id: [0x00101EA7]
At least Diocles promised to look into my inheritance issues.

Id: [0x00101EA8]
Is your cousin Adolphus still threatening to marry you off?

Id: [0x00101EA9]
He says father bequeathed him the farm.

Id: [0x00101EAA]
That little weasel is certainly persistent.

Id: [0x00101EAE]
Poor Simonides. He was so drunk last night not even Ganymede dressed up as Achilles could keep him hard.

Id: [0x00101EAF]
He was at that fat old pig's villa. I hate it there.

Id: [0x00101EB4]
Yeah but the coin is good. You can't be squeamish in this job.

Id: [0x00101EB5]
I can't help it if I don't like a hairy man.

Id: [0x00101EBA]
Leander wants us to keep an eye on Diocles.

Id: [0x00101EBB]
Does he now. Dunno why, he's a good man by all accounts.

Id: [0x00101EBC]
Doesn't matter why. There's a bladder of wine for you if you report anything suspicious.

Id: [0x00101EBD]
Well in that case I'll watch 'im like a hawk.

Id: [0x00101EBE]
You don't like any man, eh Sappho.

Id: [0x00101EBF]
Are you okay? You were drugged.

Id: [0x00101EC0]
Yes… thank you, I… gods! The Commander was going to put me on the next opium shipment. Send me somewhere… far away.

Id: [0x00101EC1]
The Commander? Do you know where he is?

Id: [0x00101EC2]
I think he left the camp on a ship. That's all I remember. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00101EC3]
Alright. Go and show yourself to Meritmaat. Do not let any soldiers see you.

Id: [0x00101EC8]
Look at you Medjay, you can protect me anytime.

Id: [0x00101EC9]
We'll do anything you want for two loafs of bread and a cup of wine.

Id: [0x00101ECA]
And we're all untouched at the Wolf's Den. As pure as Vesta's virgins (laugh).

Id: [0x00101ECB]
I've never had an Egyptian. He could be my first.

Id: [0x00101ED7]
Gennadios's men have been harassing me.

Id: [0x00101ED8]
They harass everyone.

Id: [0x00101ED9]
Just because I am a woman, they think I know where this murderess is hiding. Do they genuinely believe all women know the whereabouts of each other?

Id: [0x00101EDA]
They're desperate. Gennadios has them beaten if they don't bring back information.

Id: [0x00101EDB]
They don't have to take it out on me.

Id: [0x00101EE3]
By order of Phylakitai Gennadios! All citizens must report unusual activity! In particular, a murderess is in hiding and believed to frequent this quarter.

Id: [0x00101EE4]
Gennadios will reward useful information most generously. But refusal to volunteer relevant information will be dealt with harshly.

Id: [0x00101EE5]
Citizens well know the anger of Gennadios. If you have information, make haste to share it.

Id: [0x00101EEE]
All dark and brooding. Fancy a little tabtab to forget your woes?

Id: [0x00101EEF]
Come on you look weary desert-walker, shake the sand from your bones in my bed.

Id: [0x00101EF6]
I can't stand the way Leander looks at me. Like my cat eyes up sparrows.

Id: [0x00101EF7]
He's a pervert. I'd rather work in the quarry than clean up after another of his orgies.

Id: [0x00101EF9]
I don't know where he gets all his money from. Not from doing any work!

Id: [0x00101EFA]
All that coin he wastes on parties could help the children on the streets!

Id: [0x00101F06]
I went into his office once, just to do some cleaning. He had me flogged.

Id: [0x00101F0B]
What were they doing to it?

Id: [0x00101F0F]
It was a goat... in a wig and a toga.

Id: [0x00101F10]
Unspeakable things. Things that will haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life.

Id: [0x00101F11]
We had goat stew for dinner last night. You don't think...

Id: [0x00101F12]
Stop talking right now.

Id: [0x00101F1E]
The great and glorious Leander will hear petitioners in the Temple of Apollo on the last Friday of the month.

Id: [0x00101F1F]
By Order of the Magistrate Leander and with the full power of the Senate of Rome taxes for the month of Sextilis will increase to five percent.

Id: [0x00101F21]
Are those bodies?

Id: [0x00101F22]
Gods! The Nile will run red for many moons.

Id: [0x00101F23]
These are Romans.

Id: [0x00101F24]
None of Ptolemy's neket iadets?

Id: [0x00101F25]
No.

Id: [0x00101F2E]
Sminthos saved me from the Romans the other day. They caught me pissing in the temple pool.

Id: [0x00101F2F]
He's funny looking, and funny talking, but I like him. He gives me apples.

Id: [0x00101F30]
Yeah, got a beating for his trouble.

Id: [0x00101F3C]
Poor Mouse. At least someone is looking out for us!

Id: [0x00101F54]
Is someone out there? Help! Please hurry! There are snakes!

Id: [0x00101F57]
Keep still, and try to stay quiet. I will be right there.

Id: [0x00101F58]
A stretch indeed, Simonides.

Id: [0x00101F59]
We would be forever in your debt. But why would you risk your life to help us?

Id: [0x00101F5A]
Because those who abuse their power should be removed and the people freed from oppression. Egyptian or Greek.

Id: [0x00101F5B]
Ahhh, well said, our friend Bayek reminds me of Cicero. (belches)

Id: [0x00101F5C]
Is this where bodies are delivered?

Id: [0x00101F5D]
Yes. This is the gate to the ibu -- the place of purification.

Id: [0x00101F5E]
The dead are brought here by their families.

Id: [0x00101F5F]
Then we wash them with tears wept by the gods at the death of Osiris.

Id: [0x00101F63]
Or maybe just water. Hard to say.

Id: [0x00101F65]
I need to stand this close in order to see what you are doing.

Id: [0x00101F67]
Next I will open the flank and take out the liver, stomach, lungs, and intestines.

Id: [0x00101F68]
They are the first parts of the body to rot.

Id: [0x00101F69]
Are the internal organs discarded as well?

Id: [0x00101F6A]
Osiris, no! We put them in canopic jars, each guarded by a son of Horus.

Id: [0x00101F6B]
The heart is left inside the chest, where Ma'at can weigh it against the Feather of Truth.

Id: [0x00101F6F]
Yes, yes, I know. You want to learn what I do here.

Id: [0x00101F70]
That is a little unfair.

Id: [0x00101F71]
There's little to say about it, really.

Id: [0x00101F75]
Tell me a few more details of your work.

Id: [0x00101F76]
Fine. After being washed in palm wine, its cavity is stuffed with myrrh and cassia bark.

Id: [0x00101F7B]
A man of my own nature. He bears watching, though.

Id: [0x00101F7C]
Do you have a--

Id: [0x00101F81]
Tell me more of the natron.

Id: [0x00101F82]
The dead man sleeps beneath a mound of the stuff for forty days.

Id: [0x00101F83]
Then he is brushed off, washed in wine, and wrapped in linen.

Id: [0x00101F84]
You can see more bodies drying in the courtyard.

Id: [0x00101F85]
Has the natron changed somehow?

Id: [0x00101F86]
The texture's been a little off. Powdery.

Id: [0x00101F87]
They must be getting it from a new supplier.

Id: [0x00102081]
Where is my wine goblet!?

Id: [0x00102082]
I should talk with the brothel owner.

Id: [0x00102083]
I'm starting to get lonely.

Id: [0x0010208C]
Nor can I. Why judge?

Id: [0x00102092]
May you prosper.

Id: [0x00102096]
These ostraca are similar to those used by the children Nawa was teaching. They must have dropped it here.

Id: [0x0010209C]
Children's sandals. Removed to climb this wall?

Id: [0x0010209D]
Fresh footprints. Child-sized. They were here.

Id: [0x0010209F]
Something of importance was here.

Id: [0x001020A0]
This snake was dispatched by a small blade. A good, clean kill.

Id: [0x001020A2]
I should keep looking around.

Id: [0x001020AB]
You're scaring our customers!

Id: [0x001020AF]
My child is safe now. Thank you.

Id: [0x001020B1]
I will always remember how you helped me.

Id: [0x001020B3]
Praise to you, Deliverer.

Id: [0x001020B6]
The fertility talisman you bring us must be blue. It's very important.

Id: [0x001020B8]
I hope you will not have too much trouble finding these items.

Id: [0x001020B9]
Hunt down a flamingo, a heron, and an ibis.

Id: [0x001020BF]
The mummies. They are rotted!

Id: [0x001020C0]
This is a crime against the dead.

Id: [0x001020C8]
My gods. A crafty plan. One of the men is posing as a woman. Must be to infiltrate the palace.

Id: [0x001020C9]
Posing as wine merchants, they will dock and set a fire to cause a panic.

Id: [0x001020CA]
With an archer ready to pick off the Queen in the confusion. Somewhere high.

Id: [0x001020CB]
Venator, more than just one of Septimius' dogs. You have your own puppets within the Order. I have to find them before they strike.

Id: [0x001020CD]
Can we return to the brothel? Let's leave Cleopatra and enjoy life.

Id: [0x001020CE]
Never a dull moment in this town.

Id: [0x001020CF]
He was not wrong.

Id: [0x001020D1]
Khemwy smells!

Id: [0x001020D2]
No I don't!

Id: [0x001020D3]
Yes you do! I can smell you everywhere. I can smell you in my sleep.

Id: [0x001020D4]
It's not me! It's not!

Id: [0x001020D5]
Then who is it?

Id: [0x001020D6]
Mouty says it's a curse.

Id: [0x001020D7]
A curse on what? Your butt? [giggles]

Id: [0x001020D8]
No! I didn't do anything!

Id: [0x001020D9]
Then why do you smell so bad?

Id: [0x00102104]
Retransmission. Segment 6. Acquiring Contemporaneity.

Id: [0x00102105]
It has been one-hundred nine days since the Great Catastrophe. The messenger speaks.

Id: [0x00102108]
Wake up.

Id: [0x00102109]
Ah, Medjay! You return!

Id: [0x0010210A]
I see your daughter also returned safely. Have the soldiers given you any trouble?

Id: [0x0010210B]
Since the death of their superior, the local garrison has been… much more reasonable.

Id: [0x0010210C]
My entire life has been a lie. I'm happy to know the truth, but I don't know what to feel.

Id: [0x0010210D]
What will you do now?

Id: [0x0010210E]
Discover each other. Make up for the time that was stolen from us. Live in peace... as much as we can with the soldiers so close.

Id: [0x0010210F]
Memphis. The Commander terrorizing Kerke will be somewhere in this city. Probably near a dock.

Id: [0x00102113]
You brute! If you want to shed blood, go to the arena!

Id: [0x00102114]
You should fight in the arena with skill like that!

Id: [0x00102118]
At least I can rescue the hostage. He's being held by the Caretaker's men at Pannouki.

Id: [0x0010211A]
Draw that sword again and it'll be the galleys for you, Egyptian!

Id: [0x0010211B]
By the gods! Is that the escaped gladiator?

Id: [0x0010211C]
I love watching you! Test your mettle at the arena, Medjay, we've never had an Egyptian champion!

Id: [0x0010211E]
Talk to the Lanista, he's always on the look out for men who can fight.

Id: [0x00102122]
What is this flaming thing anyway?

Id: [0x00102123]
How in Hades should I know? It's gold though? We can sell it!

Id: [0x00102126]
Or melt it down. We'll have a good feed tonight anyway.

Id: [0x0010212A]
They captured me, forced me to work at the quarry but I escaped.

Id: [0x0010212B]
That's a death sentence. Hours in the sun, no water, no food, not even a cup of beer!

Id: [0x0010212F]
I told Hapti he shouldn't go. No-one comes back from that quarry, it's the jaws of Hades.

Id: [0x00102130]
That place is cursed, dust from the rocks makes men mad.

Id: [0x00102131]
I see the way you look at her, you better be careful lest your wife finds out.

Id: [0x00102132]
I feel sorry for poor Merope, with a kid on the way.

Id: [0x00102136]
Yeah your feet hurt, but so what? I've got to muck out that beast!

Id: [0x00102137]
Join the Roman Army, shovel shit all day!

Id: [0x00102138]
And that elephant's arse was sent from Hades, the things that come out of it you would not believe.

Id: [0x0010213C]
I caught that Seker riling up the others, I should have reported him then. He was the ringleader.

Id: [0x0010213D]
You weren't to know they were planning to revolt.

Id: [0x0010213E]
They were good workers, they didn't deserve to die. All they wanted was a few more cups of beer and they'd have been happy.

Id: [0x00102145]
Well they'll be drinking with the ferryman now. Poor bastards.

Id: [0x0010216F]
The bear will eat you with his jaws. Beware the bear, you have good cause.

Id: [0x00102170]
Let us see how you fare against some of my best fighters. Live, and we will talk.

Id: [0x00102171]
How do you know my name?

Id: [0x00102172]
Nothing much happens in Kerke I do not know about. Your wife just had your second child. And you are Kawab.

Id: [0x00102173]
That is right!

Id: [0x00102174]
You too Herihor. I know your father is sick. You could use some help.

Id: [0x00102176]
Why do I not have gifts sent around for your families? Just to make things easier this month.

Id: [0x00102179]
Take your time. Decide what to do. Your mother is at Kerke, to the South. She misses you.

Id: [0x0010217A]
Not everyone gets such an opportunity. I wish you both well.

Id: [0x0010217B]
Roman soil is dry. Let's water it with Egyptian blood.

Id: [0x0010217D]
This warrior proved himself at the arena. Let's show him we don't need all that pomp and circumstance to beat the shit out of someone.

Id: [0x0010217E]
Ah here's the Egyptian clown. I knew he would lead me straight to you.

Id: [0x00102182]
Memphis. It is beautiful, but it stinks of the battlefield… or a tomb.

Id: [0x00102183]
I have bows, blades, scepters... you won't be disappointed. The Mouse guarantees it… Sir…

Id: [0x00102184]
Then I will face the demons. Pray that your faith shields me.

Id: [0x00102185]
[huffs] Ptah grant you safety.

Id: [0x00102187]
If the wrappings are sound, the fault lies in the embalming.

Id: [0x001021B9]
The mummies would not be tampered with so early in the process. This man is likely innocent.

Id: [0x001021BA]
Fascinating.

Id: [0x001021BB]
We never get visitors here. Come see us any time!

Id: [0x001021C2]
A friendly face can hide guilt… yet I do not suspect him.

Id: [0x001021C3]
If only it were so easy to escape their gaze.

Id: [0x001021C4]
Sorry? I did not hear you.

Id: [0x001021C5]
Never mind.

Id: [0x001021CD]
Find us there when you secure the evidence. Fortuna smile on you, my friend.

Id: [0x001021D1]
I have never seen eye to eye with priests.

Id: [0x001021D6]
Wonder if we'll get any pretty ones today?

Id: [0x001021E1]
[whistles a merry tune]

Id: [0x00102205]
I won't speak to a man who maligns the great Herodotus.

Id: [0x00102207]
Behold the Lord and his Flood! See, the Shoulder is fastened on his neck…

Id: [0x00102208]
…and the Haunch upon the head of the West,

Id: [0x00102209]
Offerings which the two goddesses of the West present to me…

Id: [0x0010220A]
When the weeping bursts forth from me at what I witness…

Id: [0x0010220B]
As I am borne round on the seventh feastday in Abydos…

Id: [0x0010220C]
…and the bolts on the gateways above you are in reach of your hand.

Id: [0x0010220E]
Anubis is my bearer, for he who lulls me to rest is the god in Lion form.

Id: [0x0010220F]
The god saves me!

Id: [0x00102210]
I am He who comes forth as one who breaks through the door.

Id: [0x00102211]
"I know the deep waters" is my name.

Id: [0x00102212]
Behold the Lord and his Flood! See, the Shoulder is fastened on his neck…

Id: [0x00102213]
…and the Haunch upon the head of the West,

Id: [0x00102214]
Offerings which the two goddesses of the West present to me…

Id: [0x00102215]
When the weeping bursts forth from me at what I witness…

Id: [0x00102216]
As I am borne round on the seventh feastday in Abydos…

Id: [0x00102217]
…and the bolts on the gateways above you are in reach of your hand.

Id: [0x0010226D]
We've sent workers to remove the bodies from the tomb.

Id: [0x0010226F]
Surely my heart will be fed to the Devourer.

Id: [0x00102271]
Please, uncover the keepers of this plot before it ensnares my daughter.

Id: [0x00102279]
So the mummies were tampered with. May the perpetrator of this crime suffer for eternity.

Id: [0x0010227B]
I did not think to see you again. You seem like the wandering type.

Id: [0x0010227C]
It seems my prayers were successful in shielding you.

Id: [0x001022CE]
A touching letter. Hapti and Merope, lovers torn apart by oppression. Reminds me of Aya and myself.

Id: [0x001022CF]
How can they work with all their dead brothers rotting like animals?

Id: [0x001022D0]
His lover has no idea he is dead. This sickens me. I must put to rest his ka and return the bracelet.

Id: [0x001022D2]
These Roman neket iadets have crushed love.

Id: [0x001022E6]
Not unlike us.

Id: [0x001022E7]
He began the rule of our latest pharaohs. The dynasty of Ptolemies that have ruined Egypt.

Id: [0x001022F5]
I imagine they've spread this propaganda across the land.

Id: [0x001022F6]
I should seek the rest out and have them meet the same fate as this one.

Id: [0x00102309]
By the gods! What are you doing?

Id: [0x0010230A]
Destroying this propaganda.

Id: [0x0010230B]
You are either fearless, or a fool. Either way, I wonder, would you be able to help rid our town of another monstrous element?

Id: [0x0010230C]
What is it?

Id: [0x0010230D]
His name is Djar.... the foreman who forces us to build these monstrocities... he works us to death. He expects miracles!

Id: [0x0010230E]
He uses his position and influence to intimidate, steal, and worse.

Id: [0x0010230F]
I'll deal with this fool.

Id: [0x00102310]
Be cautious... he wanders the village with a mountainous brute of a man as his bodyguard.

Id: [0x00102311]
He uses a man's name, Sanakht, but I am convinced he is an animal in a man's clothing.

Id: [0x0010231A]
Where is that treasonous fool?

Id: [0x0010231B]
You will find that filthy beggar. Now.

Id: [0x0010231C]
Sir! I believe he is an actor.

Id: [0x0010231D]
I don't care what he is. We must find him or I'll be stuck mucking stables for weeks.

Id: [0x0010231E]
I'm sure the damned fool is around here somewhere.

Id: [0x0010231F]
Maybe if we speak some lines he could be fooled into coming after us.

Id: [0x00102321]
... There is no way that could work. Keep looking!

Id: [0x00102326]
Look for a ship with a fancy canopy. The bitch likes her comforts.

Id: [0x00102328]
Quit dawdling and go get that dung-fingered child-snatcher.

Id: [0x0010232A]
How did you know my name?

Id: [0x0010232B]
I know every neket iadet in the streets of Memphis.

Id: [0x0010232D]
If you don't leave now, I'll steal your Medjay badge and throw it down a well.

Id: [0x0010232E]
Why did they kill Father?

Id: [0x00102330]
Who's going to take care of us now?

Id: [0x00102332]
The bees will be sad without Father to look after them.

Id: [0x00102334]
They hurt Kawit too! They're bad people!

Id: [0x00102339]
I liked it when Father gave us oranges.

Id: [0x0010233F]
I need to move quickly, or this monster will flee Memphis.

Id: [0x00102340]
Senu can find a ship with colored sails faster than I can.

Id: [0x0010234B]
Kawit has her vengeance now. I hope it quiets her heart.

Id: [0x0010234C]
[onos of cold] This river breeze is like to the breath of the north wind!

Id: [0x0010234D]
Ambrose, go below and fetch my woven shawl. The red one.

Id: [0x0010234F]
This will be a useless trip. So little cargo, and none of it human.

Id: [0x00102351]
I cannot wait to wring the neck of that wretched girl, Kawit.

Id: [0x00102353]
Can we turn the ship a little to one side? The sun is in my eyes.

Id: [0x00102357]
Is it done?

Id: [0x00102358]
It is.

Id: [0x00102359]
My sword is yours.

Id: [0x0010235A]
I am honored.

Id: [0x0010235B]
Honor means nothing to me. Only survival counts.

Id: [0x0010235D]
I fight for the survival of Egypt. Will you lend your arm to my cause?

Id: [0x0010235E]
Don't be stupid.

Id: [0x0010235F]
I will take that as a yes.

Id: [0x00102363]
I already said my sword is yours.

Id: [0x00102365]
Why are you still here? Go save Egypt or something.

Id: [0x0010236B]
[humming or singing off-key]

Id: [0x0010236C]
Oh, shit! Layla, you need a refill on cyclosporine, stat.

Id: [0x0010236E]
Layla… Wakey wakey…

Id: [0x0010236F]
[groans faintly]

Id: [0x00102370]
Don't make me come down there!

Id: [0x0010237E]
I'm proud to be in the Ironclads. I would follow General Agrippa to Avernus.

Id: [0x0010237F]
You know where you stand with him. Cross him and he'll kill you.

Id: [0x00102382]
These ballista we're building, we've been loading them on ships at Apollonia.

Id: [0x00102383]
And I'll be packed off with them.

Id: [0x00102384]
Where?

Id: [0x00102385]
Agrippa has his sights on Egypt.

Id: [0x00102387]
Don't bathe in the Oasis. The sand of that shit-hole rubs you so raw, you'll come back with a bald scrotum.

Id: [0x0010238A]
Flavius will put Cyrenaica on the the map!

Id: [0x0010238B]
It's already on the map, how do you think we got here?

Id: [0x0010238E]
Now those Egyptian dung-eaters feel the might of Flavius.

Id: [0x0010238F]
He will march us to Rome in triumph. Do you think he will be our new king?

Id: [0x00102390]
Why stop at king? They'll make him a god.

Id: [0x00102393]
Thank you, Bayek. You protect us even this far from the land of our ancestors.

Id: [0x00102394]
Vitruvius, a Roman engineer up at the aqueduct invented it.

Id: [0x00102395]
Greek fire?

Id: [0x00102396]
A substance with such potential for unspeakable suffering, I vowed never to produce it.

Id: [0x00102397]
Well the general is producing it, and forcing Siwans to arm his ballista for a war against their own country.

Id: [0x00102398]
Do what your conscience dictates, Bayek. But understand I cannot be part of a plot against a Roman General. No matter how I may feel personally.

Id: [0x00102399]
Flavius fed Agrippa's pride and ambition with talk of empires. I fear the path his supporters have taken will end in many deaths.

Id: [0x0010239A]
I'm working on a book on architecture! My magnum opus.

Id: [0x0010239D]
I heard Vitruvius arguing with the General over that concoction. Said he would never make it.

Id: [0x0010239E]
He bloody invented the stuff, why balk now? It's only Egyptians that are going to get fried.

Id: [0x001023A3]
It's a horrible way to die. Nailed to a plank gasping for air.

Id: [0x001023A4]
A traitors death. We've civilized these bloody ingrates. Without us they'd still be shagging in mud huts.

Id: [0x001023A6]
Let's get free of this barbaric place first.

Id: [0x001023AB]
Those so-called rebels are getting bolder by the day, raiding caravans, stealing our supplies.

Id: [0x001023AC]
Agrippa gave the order to kill them on sight. He'd done pissing about.

Id: [0x001023AD]
Apate strode the same sand as Khemu. Our ancestors shared the Wahat, where do the Romans have her now?

Id: [0x001023AE]
Don't worry. I will bring Apate back to you, Ibi.

Id: [0x001023AF]
(laugh) Defy Rome and get a sword in the gut.

Id: [0x001023B0]
Apart from their leader, General's saving a special punishment for her.

Id: [0x001023B5]
They wanted to post me up at Prasinos but I refused. No way I'm serving under Severus.

Id: [0x001023B6]
He's a mad bastard, drinks the blood of Egyptian babies.

Id: [0x001023B7]
Grant me wisdom to see our enemies among the reeds, and strength to cut them down.

Id: [0x001023B8]
I give you my faith, I give you my arm, I give you my righteousness in service of Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x001023B9]
Where did you hear that? You should stop getting drunk with Erasmus, he's a shit-peddler.

Id: [0x001023BA]
No! Apate of Siwa? Her and Khemu would hunt together in the scrubland.

Id: [0x001023BE]
He should be easy to find with a tattoo.

Id: [0x001023BF]
I'm just another woman the Romans have made a widow. This is the war no one speaks of.

Id: [0x001023C2]
This man's days of spreading lies and tormenting innocents are over.

Id: [0x001023C8]
There's the foreman.

Id: [0x001023CE]
Could you stand to be married to him?

Id: [0x001023D0]
Well, yes, it's true he does stink, but he's well known for his work. And people pay well for it.

Id: [0x001023D2]
You should be nicer to her. Sau village is better for having a tanner here.

Id: [0x001023D3]
Good points. I'll try!

Id: [0x001023D6]
I suppose that's fair.

Id: [0x001023DA]
How was the hunt?

Id: [0x001023DB]
Tough. We had to range far to find any good prey.

Id: [0x001023DC]
Oh?

Id: [0x001023DD]
Yeah. Best hunting was up to the north west of the village.

Id: [0x001023DE]
Up near the large rock at the tip of the coast?

Id: [0x001023DF]
Right. Careful, though. Hyenas tend to den around there.

Id: [0x001023FE]
Ah, the Medjay! It is good to see you again. Things are much better here now.

Id: [0x001023FF]
Bayek, you have come back. Any news from Apollodorus? Sais is quiet these days.

Id: [0x00102416]
Sword of Apollodorus, can I get you a beer?

Id: [0x00102418]
Life is good in Sais. There are still evil men in the world, but we are lucky that their greedy gaze lands elsewhere.

Id: [0x00102419]
For now, Hapi protects us. Thanks to you!

Id: [0x0010241D]
Any metal work you need done?

Id: [0x0010241F]
I'm still hunting for Zervos.

Id: [0x00102420]
Hunting, ah? Sorry, I cannot tell you anything.

Id: [0x00102422]
If you want to discuss some metal work you need done, come see me at the market.

Id: [0x00102426]
I'm still looking for Zervos.

Id: [0x00102427]
I told you already! I don't know anything! Leave me be!

Id: [0x0010242C]
Don't bother me now. If you want to buy, see me in the market.

Id: [0x00102433]
Those ragged voices. Those must be the last of the farmers that they've imprisoned.

Id: [0x00102435]
Hm. War plans... They are harnessing elephants to fight?

Id: [0x00102436]
And they are honing their killing instincts on the farmers?

Id: [0x00102438]
By the horns of Amun! The size of this beast!

Id: [0x00102439]
The power behind it must be immense. It must have taken a full cow just to make this harness!

Id: [0x0010243D]
I've been here before… as Bayek.

Id: [0x0010243E]
The desert sure doesn't change much.

Id: [0x00102442]
How did this make it through the storm?

Id: [0x00102448]
Any further word on Zervos?

Id: [0x00102449]
[YAWN] Sorry. Uh, who is that again?

Id: [0x0010244A]
Another late night?

Id: [0x0010244C]
They are all long these days.

Id: [0x0010244D]
I see.

Id: [0x00102451]
If you need some armor work, find me at the market.

Id: [0x00102455]
Generator's holding up. Good job, Layla.

Id: [0x00102457]
Uh, sorry. Can't help you.

Id: [0x0010245C]
Here's the blueprint for my dialysis system mod.

Id: [0x0010245D]
Could've used a bigger fluid chamber.

Id: [0x0010245E]
Could've used a bigger piece of tape over your mouth.

Id: [0x0010245F]
Whoa, so aggro!

Id: [0x00102462]
Here's the blueprint for my dialysis system mod.

Id: [0x00102463]
Dee was right about the chamber.

Id: [0x00102467]
The genetic sequencer blueprint. Never got the creases out.

Id: [0x0010246F]
Abstergo's blueprint for the portable Animus. Still a piece of shit.

Id: [0x00102470]
You sure loved polishing it, though.

Id: [0x00102472]
Abstergo's blueprint for the portable Animus. Still a piece of shit.

Id: [0x00102476]
The vault is opening! Run for cover!

Id: [0x0010247A]
They're frightened of the opening door.

Id: [0x0010248A]
So we disarm, then.

Id: [0x0010249A]
For each of us you kill, there will be a hero in the Duat.

Id: [0x0010249B]
Murder me, I don't care, but you stand no chance against Egypt.

Id: [0x0010249C]
Apate, if your people don't end their rampage, we'll decimate them.

Id: [0x0010249D]
I feared it was you, Apate.

Id: [0x0010249E]
It was your strength and spirit that Khemu loved the most.

Id: [0x0010249F]
My days were filled with freedom then. Your boy and I hunted, laughed, lived. That is all I want for my children.

Id: [0x001024A3]
Hide in the trees and prepare for the worst my rebel brothers and sisters.

Id: [0x001024A4]
Our ancestors were tribal and nomads, they ruled the land with a wanton chaos. We shall do the same.

Id: [0x001024A9]
By order of the proconsul of Cyrenaica anyone harboring the rebels will be executed.

Id: [0x001024AA]
They are not freedom fighters, they are traitors of Rome and as such will be punished to the utmost letter of the law.

Id: [0x001024AB]
Hear this, for this is a proclamation of the proconsul. Roma invicta.

Id: [0x001024AC]
Vox populi my arse! You're just a few Siwan troublemakers.

Id: [0x001024AD]
Fortune favors the brave!

Id: [0x001024AE]
Death before defeat!

Id: [0x001024B5]
Ah, look it is the Medjay.

Id: [0x001024B6]
One more warrior to add to our ranks.

Id: [0x001024B7]
I hope Amun works among us.

Id: [0x001024B8]
We need an elephant. They are godly, we put Cleopatra on an elephant, she will be revered.

Id: [0x001024B9]
I saw the Romans bring one, to the east of Herakleion. We could steal it. (laughs)

Id: [0x001024BC]
I'm coming with your wine!

Id: [0x001024BD]
May your days be filled with the light of Ra.

Id: [0x00102630]
Could the Gallic Brothers be next?

Id: [0x00102634]
Bayek of Siwa? Can that be you?

Id: [0x00102648]
Be thankful Brutus Severus hasn't taken you back to the fort for his amusement.

Id: [0x00102650]
All hail the new champions…

Id: [0x001027FE]
Shadya...

Id: [0x001027FF]
Shadya...

Id: [0x00102800]
Shadya...

Id: [0x00102948]
If Leander's scribe knows anything he's not saying.

Id: [0x00102949]
Secrets and lies my friend, secrets and lies.

Id: [0x0010294A]
Ah! The fool finally comes.

Id: [0x0010294B]
You will see your gods soon.

Id: [0x00102984]
Did you find her? The Oracle in the mountains?

Id: [0x00102985]
She told me I would have five sons! Can you imagine that many men in the house?

Id: [0x00102986]
I have felt your presence in my visions, Eagle. Apollo spoke of you.

Id: [0x0010298A]
Something is killing my goats, it's the Strix I know it!

Id: [0x0010298B]
That bloodsucker hokum? It's probably leopards.

Id: [0x0010298C]
Do leopards drink blood? Do they drain the very essence from the living?

Id: [0x0010298D]
Leander is threatening to take my farm, for the glory of Rome he says.

Id: [0x0010298E]
Rome has enough glory. They've raped this land, taken everything worth more than a drachma.

Id: [0x0010298F]
Should I fight it? Appeal to Diocles? Maybe the Oracle in the mountains will show me the way.

Id: [0x00102990]
That Roman makes a pilgrimage here every night.

Id: [0x00102991]
He should be praying for Apollo's forgiveness, have you not seen the broken bodies on the road?

Id: [0x00102992]
The lake of tears. What was the next part? The sun god drove his fist into the mountain?

Id: [0x00102993]
I might pay that Apollo Oracle a visit. See if a promotion to Centurion is on the cards.

Id: [0x00102994]
She's a seer, not a miracle worker.

Id: [0x00102995]
Cracks in the rock, something is behind.

Id: [0x00102996]
The divine huntress Cyrene, herself.

Id: [0x00102997]
The legend of Cyrene and Apollo.

Id: [0x00102999]
Apollo fell in love with her.

Id: [0x0010299B]
The girl lion-killer. She sounds strong and brave, reminds me of Aya.

Id: [0x0010299F]
Hey, Egyptian, come see!

Id: [0x001029A0]
Are they not the worst nags you've ever seen?

Id: [0x001029A4]
Darius has been inconsolable since they took Hermes.

Id: [0x001029A5]
He is altogether too fond of that horse.

Id: [0x001029A6]
And so would you be if your horse wasn't two hooves away from the knacker's yard.

Id: [0x001029AB]
There's rich pickings round here. It's the breadbasket of Rome.

Id: [0x001029AC]
Not much else to do but raise chickens and goats. I might settle down here, buy a nice farm.

Id: [0x001029B9]
How's the life of a racer?

Id: [0x001029BA]
I heard a breeder to the east of city has some of the fastest. And a fat-balled stallion with a god's name.

Id: [0x001029DB]
The lid of a sarcophagus? There was a symbol here, but it is too damaged for me to make out.

Id: [0x001029DC]
Scraps of blood and flesh. There was a body here, but crocodiles must have devoured it.

Id: [0x001029DD]
Was this some terrible ceremony? There is so much blood, as if some butchery occurred here. But the elements have eroded many of the signs.

Id: [0x001029E4]
I suppose wine is too much to hope for, but may I at least have a drink of water?

Id: [0x001029E6]
My throat cries in thirst!

Id: [0x001029E8]
Let me free! My sisters surely weep for my return.

Id: [0x001029EA]
I require medical attention! My wounds are festering!

Id: [0x001029EC]
How about I pour piss down your gullet and call it wine?

Id: [0x001029ED]
What a vulgar thing to say.

Id: [0x001029EE]
Swaddle it with mud!

Id: [0x001029EF]
And the girls in the tavern weep for mine, but they'll be just as surely disappointed.

Id: [0x001029F0]
We will send a dog to lick them for you.

Id: [0x001029F2]
You have an unusual fighting style. I like it.

Id: [0x001029F3]
None of you are moved by human kindness? I almost feel sorry for you.

Id: [0x001029F4]
Save your pity for the tavern girls.

Id: [0x00102A09]
I should find a horse.

Id: [0x00102A0B]
Out of my way please.

Id: [0x00102A0C]
Official business for the Pharaoh, excuse me.

Id: [0x00102A0D]
Please, I need to get him to a healer.

Id: [0x00102A0E]
Sorry, my uncle drank too much.

Id: [0x00102A11]
Look! The vault!

Id: [0x00102A12]
By the great god Amun.

Id: [0x00102A13]
It's opening!

Id: [0x00102A19]
Shall we race, like we did in Siwa?

Id: [0x00102A1A]
Only if you're ready to lose.

Id: [0x00102A1B]
Bold words. I will see you back them up.

Id: [0x00102A1C]
Let's get you out of here.

Id: [0x00102A23]
What is the prize for winning?

Id: [0x00102A24]
You'll never find out!

Id: [0x00102A26]
Eat my dust!

Id: [0x00102A29]
You're slower than Ramses, and he's been dead a few years now!

Id: [0x00102A2B]
You can't keep that pace.

Id: [0x00102A2C]
Try me!

Id: [0x00102A2E]
Faster, beast, faster! I need to prove a point!

Id: [0x00102A32]
Go on! Get that skin! I will be fine. Just need to rest my leg.

Id: [0x00102A33]
Then I will go and meet the Priest. You clear my name!

Id: [0x00102A38]
The blood trail leads to this door.

Id: [0x00102A39]
I must prepare myself.

Id: [0x00102A76]
Seems I have come out on top.

Id: [0x00102A77]
Seems you have.

Id: [0x00102A78]
We all have weaknesses.

Id: [0x00102A79]
Yes, and yours is winning graciously.

Id: [0x00102A8D]
[yell of triumph]

Id: [0x00102A8E]
If you are that confident, let's race again.

Id: [0x00102A8F]
No time!

Id: [0x001031B6]
She told me the lion would fall by the eagle's claws. Fat lot of use that was.

Id: [0x001031B7]
Your soul is shrouded. Trapped in the shadowlands between being and oblivion.

Id: [0x001031B8]
Not bad old man!

Id: [0x001031B9]
How is that for old!

Id: [0x001031BA]
Nek! I thought I had you.

Id: [0x001031BB]
The Oracle will tell me the truth, she sees all.

Id: [0x001031BE]
Apollo's lyre, Apollo's song, I speak with the voice of light.

Id: [0x001031C0]
There is no certainty, Eagle. You may as well hold a wolf by the ears.

Id: [0x001031C1]
Why do you call me Eagle?

Id: [0x001031C2]
Phoebus has sung you his chorus, Eagle.

Id: [0x001031C7]
Find the Halo of the Huntress.

Id: [0x001031C9]
There is no more.

Id: [0x001031CE]
Sanguine is the key that unlocks the door.

Id: [0x001031D0]
You walk a path in the shadow of We That Came Before.

Id: [0x001031D7]
An empire will arise from his ashes.

Id: [0x001031D9]
Paris will have his Helen, no matter the cost.

Id: [0x001031DB]
Beware the three-headed hydra, for he will devour the asp.

Id: [0x001031DE]
Heed the Ides of March.

Id: [0x001031DF]
The Hidden One will greet you, but not yet, not yet.

Id: [0x001031E0]
Orpheus and Eurydice will be torn asunder. Do not look back.

Id: [0x001031E1]
He walks in splendor in the footsteps of the Therans. A god made flesh.

Id: [0x001031E3]
He who was born of the thunderbolt holds the relic of the elder ones.

Id: [0x001031E7]
The Macedon Rex will sink in the Crocodile's tears.

Id: [0x001031E8]
Medjay! We've heard you took care of the bandit leader for us. It is thanks to you that we can even begin thinking about rebuilding our lives.

Id: [0x001031E9]
My family and I are gathering supplies for a long journey ahead. It won't be easy making it out of this wasteland.

Id: [0x001031EA]
Nothing is easy. Stay safe my friends.

Id: [0x001031EB]
The eaglet waits for you in the fields of your forebearers.

Id: [0x001031F0]
The she-wolf comes from the waters. But vultures will feast upon the jackal's marrow.

Id: [0x001031F3]
More terrible men will arise in his place. Then you will know the true meaning of tyranny.

Id: [0x001031F5]
What you seek is legion.

Id: [0x001031F8]
The hog wallows in the mud, stuff an apple in his mouth, Eagle.

Id: [0x001031FB]
A new peace will come. Seek out the triumvirate. The healer, the architect, the judge.

Id: [0x001031FE]
Trust the trickster. His whiskers do not lie.

Id: [0x00103202]
The healer's staff is not what it seems. The viper uncoiled lies in whispers.

Id: [0x00103207]
What is this madness, old man? Your eyes have been ravaged?

Id: [0x00103208]
That is one ferocious lion.

Id: [0x0010320C]
I only went berry picking.

Id: [0x0010320D]
Are we near. Near the clinic, Bayek?

Id: [0x00103211]
The Guardians of Siwa!

Id: [0x00103212]
Will it be life?

Id: [0x00103213]
Or death?

Id: [0x00103214]
This temple is not a place of healing! They let my husband die because we had no coin!

Id: [0x00103215]
Justice! Justice for those scorned by the servants of Asclepius.

Id: [0x0010321A]
Are you the healer Theramenes?

Id: [0x0010321D]
Yes, yes. Is that Galenos? By the Fates, what happened to him?

Id: [0x0010321F]
And his wits along with them.

Id: [0x00103220]
I have honey and euphrasia… but the temple purloined my more exotic supplies.

Id: [0x00103224]
Argg! Are you the griffin? Spiriting me off!

Id: [0x00103225]
Be still Galenos, it is me Bayek, your savior.

Id: [0x00103226]
I've brought him this far, so what do you need?

Id: [0x0010322D]
I didn't join the army to guard weeds.

Id: [0x0010322E]
These weeds are more valuable to the war effort than your pickled hide.

Id: [0x0010322F]
Sekhmet, the goddess of hunters. But there are scratches here, above the statue's stomach. What does it represent?

Id: [0x00103230]
There, in the distance.

Id: [0x00103239]
This poor man was half-eaten by crocodiles. But only after he died. Someone prepared him for burial, and cut out some of his sacred organs. His stomach, at least, was removed.

Id: [0x0010326E]
If Diocles was my lover I would chain him to the bed before I let him leave me for Cyrene.

Id: [0x0010326F]
That is because you think of nothing but men. Praxilla has her own life here with her clinic.

Id: [0x00103270]
Flavius Metellus, Proconsul of Cyrenaica deserves our praise. He who brings bread to the starving, who brings wine to the thirsty.

Id: [0x00103271]
He who gave us the greatest gift that Rome has to offer, a free and civilized land. Give him thanks in your prayers to the gods.

Id: [0x001032B8]
Continue, this way.

Id: [0x001032EC]
That Roman weed?

Id: [0x0010330A]
Those temple priests stole all my best herbs and tinctures.

Id: [0x0010330D]
Hurry Bayek, we must ease Galenos' pain.

Id: [0x00103314]
You are no different than any of the others who have come before you!

Id: [0x00103315]
If I stumble across a manticore stalking the woods of Balagrae, I will bring you it's head.

Id: [0x0010331B]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0010331C]
Very well.

Id: [0x0010331D]
We are not accustomed to many things either.

Id: [0x0010331E]
Guest legionary, at ease.

Id: [0x0010331F]
Shadya!

Id: [0x00103320]
You do not remember those you killed. She was the child of Khenut and Hotephres.

Id: [0x0010332F]
That's very poetic, Marcus. You're wasted in the army.

Id: [0x00103332]
And so you will find the same fate as all other trespassers. Death by my hand.

Id: [0x0010333E]
Bayek…

Id: [0x00103340]
Let's go to the temple -- we can speak more of your dreams on the way.

Id: [0x00103343]
We will need to speak of it someday, once the sands have settled.

Id: [0x00103345]
Really?

Id: [0x00103347]
You have returned... alive.

Id: [0x0010334C]
You have your horse, and the desert is free of the Hyena. Why so disappointed, Mered?

Id: [0x0010334D]
Ah it is nothing. I bet that you would die within those walls, Medjay. You come out, I lose money.

Id: [0x0010334E]
I pray this be the last time we meet, Mered.

Id: [0x00103354]
"Bayek of Siwa, styling himself as a Medjay, is sought for crimes against the rule of our glorious Pharaoh…"

Id: [0x0010335D]
Looks like the pilot got away, but left embalming tools.

Id: [0x0010335F]
They must have brought the sarcophagus by felucca. Pretty remote place for this. Some of those marks on the body look like the sacred organs were removed. At least the lungs are gone.

Id: [0x00103369]
Our blood oath to this soil is unbreakable.

Id: [0x0010336A]
I have seen many bandits, they are cynical and callous.

Id: [0x0010336E]
You are fast along the rocks Rai!

Id: [0x0010336F]
I know these caverns. They are a natural temple.

Id: [0x00103371]
Ah! I know. Maybe you can throw a corpse in there for me? We both win!

Id: [0x00103374]
A statue of Sobek, lord of the Nile. But he's contained within a symbol that invokes Serqet, the scorpion goddess of magic.

Id: [0x00103378]
Blood on the water. Omens in the sky.

Id: [0x0010337D]
A strange symbol on the wall. It looks like a scorpion. Perhaps a dedication to the goddess Serqet?

Id: [0x0010337F]
The mark of Serqet. She is the goddess of magic and poison. The one who tightens the throat, and the one who allows us to breathe.

Id: [0x0010338F]
How many of the Phylakes have these?

Id: [0x00103393]
Clearly they protect something of value.

Id: [0x00103397]
"Abar refuses to hand over the last key… She busies herself with simple tasks in that sad fishing village east of Herakleion."

Id: [0x001033A2]
This symbol is old. This place is from a long time lost.

Id: [0x001033A5]
Troubling. If I had more information, I might understand this better. But as he was eaten by a crocodile… I'll keep an eye out for anything else so unusual.

Id: [0x001033A6]
Letopolis is a right and a privilege for Egyptians everywhere.

Id: [0x001033A9]
This is deeply disturbing. Someone killed him, and removed his sacred stomach in a mockery of proper burial. Or perhaps a clumsy imitation of it.

Id: [0x001033C3]
The lotus flower of rebirth. She must have picked these for a reason.

Id: [0x001033DD]
This happened recently, and the cart may not have traveled far. There may be more to this mystery nearby. Those responsible should not be allowed to do this again.

Id: [0x001033DF]
Whoever removed his organs seems to have done so for a sinister reason. There is nothing normal about this.

Id: [0x001033E0]
Peace, friend. You are free. I will deal with Khaliset.

Id: [0x001033E4]
I am one, and I seek your key.

Id: [0x001033E5]
Why would I give it to you when I refuse it to my brothers?

Id: [0x001033E8]
Prove yourself as a protector, and I will give you the one thing I have left -- the key.

Id: [0x001033ED]
Someone came here with a heavily laden cart. And left the same way, though the second track looks lighter.

Id: [0x001033EF]
I suspect the sarcophagus was transported by cart. It is inscribed with the mark of Serqet, the scorpion goddess.

Id: [0x001033F0]
Poor man. You did not deserve to be dragged underwater by these hippos. And it appears you were prepared for the afterlife by a clumsy butcher with no thumbs. Where is your liver?

Id: [0x001033F1]
The mysterious killings have led here.

Id: [0x00103401]
Four keys, four locks.

Id: [0x00103402]
Now I will see this great warrior's treasure.

Id: [0x00103409]
Not from a dreamless sleep or an absence of light. But from a reality that will soon cease to be.

Id: [0x0010340B]
Wake up.

Id: [0x0010340C]
The next chapter is unstoppable.

Id: [0x0010340D]
And yet. The greatest revolutions sometimes originate from the confines of impossibility, do they not?

Id: [0x0010340E]
Change your mind. Subvert your perception. Stop this world. Bend it into something new.

Id: [0x00103411]
Destiny is not without irony. Here I am, imploring a lesser version of myself… to do what I could never do.

Id: [0x00103414]
In this timeless moment, you and I are a bridge. Both of us from different eras, meeting half way at the narrowing of the hourglass in this ocean of sand.

Id: [0x00103417]
It is not enough to tell time. You must learn Time. (INAUDIBLE) And in so doing, escape the inescapable.

Id: [0x0010341A]
Fill in the blanks: the ones hiding between words, between worlds. Find the spaces that we could not erase, the variables that ended up erasing us.

Id: [0x0010341B]
If you do not, they will erase you as well.

Id: [0x0010341D]
Time told of a story that ended with us, and now it tells of a story that ends with you. Once upon a time, a new story will begin.

Id: [0x0010341F]
After the functions which run our days have scattered into an array of random numbers.

Id: [0x00103422]
We found solace in Order, we thought it would help us rule the world.

Id: [0x00103424]
We were wrong. Order never served us. It has kept us within the code, within the boundaries. We were tricked into thinking we were the ones writing the rules when they were in fact guiding us to our conclusion.

Id: [0x00103427]
You need to transgress. You, of all people, understand the value of disobeying.

Id: [0x00103428]
Take an unexpected turn, away from the path that is drawn straight ahead of you.

Id: [0x0010342A]
The Animus was humankind's first unconscious attempt to explain what it could not see. Understanding genetic memories, an eye into history.

Id: [0x0010342C]
But the Animus bears a fatal flaw. It follows the rules from those who embrace Order just as we did. It allows you to witness – but not alter.

Id: [0x0010342E]
Your Animus is different. As is the mind that imagined it. It could escape the code. It could do that leap, and make possible a decision that defies the order of things that are.

Id: [0x00103432]
Wake up.

Id: [0x00103433]
Be the chaos that comes to be. Gods are just like you and me.

Id: [0x00103436]
Remember.

Id: [0x00103437]
Nothing is real.

Id: [0x00103438]
Everything is permitted.

Id: [0x0010343B]
Speaking of authenticity, in the arena you use the weapons I give you. There are no exceptions.

Id: [0x00103460]
How is our brave widow?

Id: [0x00103461]
Good, as you can see.

Id: [0x00103470]
Amun smiled upon us my son, he sent us the Medjay so that he could bring you back to me.

Id: [0x00103472]
I'm so happy you are safe, Mother.

Id: [0x00103476]
Bayek! I heard what happened in Cyrene.

Id: [0x00103478]
Bayek, you look well, but weary.

Id: [0x00103479]
Small victories and joys like these. We take them where we can.

Id: [0x0010347F]
Stop your screeching, the sick need their rest.

Id: [0x00103483]
Praxilla!

Id: [0x00103484]
Alright, alright, just keep your voice down. She left to speak to the priestess.

Id: [0x00103485]
Look to this man, he needs help. I will find this Shrine of Whispers.

Id: [0x00103488]
Melitta, the viper of the staff…

Id: [0x00103492]
You have the Priestess' orders. No one goes in or out of the Shrine of Whispers.

Id: [0x00103493]
Since when do we take orders from Greeks, or women?

Id: [0x00103494]
Since she became Flavius' right hand in Balagrae. Got any more stupid questions?

Id: [0x001034A3]
Melitta was mad.

Id: [0x001034A4]
That relic, the one that Flavius used at the farm. He used it here.

Id: [0x001034A5]
When I found Crios, I knew. I could feel it clawing, digging in my mind.

Id: [0x001034A6]
That is what it does, insidious like a parasite. Control men's minds and make us slaves.

Id: [0x001034A7]
Our fates are our own, Praxilla, we will always fight for that.

Id: [0x001034AE]
Melitta could not be saved.

Id: [0x001034AF]
And that is why I give it freely, while freedom still means something.

Id: [0x001034B0]
Who couldn't?

Id: [0x001034B4]
Hello again! How are your Siwan treasures selling?

Id: [0x001034B5]
No, no. No Siwa. Too much trouble!

Id: [0x001034B6]
We sell real treasure from Giza now! Not fake! Would you like?

Id: [0x001034B7]
Ha-ha. You are still a cheeky child.

Id: [0x001034B9]
Come, come! Many unique treasures from far away!

Id: [0x001034BA]
I wonder what the story behind this is

Id: [0x001034BB]
I love him like a brother, actually my brother's a donkey's arse. I love him more than my brother.

Id: [0x001034BC]
Terrible, I lose more than I win.

Id: [0x001034BD]
You know what you need? A Cyrenaican horse.

Id: [0x001034C2]
A beard does not make a philosopher, Laurentius.

Id: [0x001034C8]
The quest for Hermes continues.

Id: [0x001034CD]
Last week he found me a fist and phallus amulet. And better craftsmanship than you find in Rome.

Id: [0x001034D8]
Bayek! It is good to see you.

Id: [0x001034D9]
How are you both?

Id: [0x001034DA]
We are alive. To be honest, we are better than I imagined we could be. There is still a lot of work to be done here. It keeps us both occupied. That helps.

Id: [0x001034DB]
For me, there is only the things to be done today. I no longer think of the future.

Id: [0x001034DC]
Faiyum's future is safe in your hands, seni.

Id: [0x001034E1]
Apollo bade Gaea cradle the King's sorrow, a lake of tears high above the plains.

Id: [0x001034E2]
Yours is the sacred relic, Eagle. Find it and expand your riches.

Id: [0x001034E3]
The "crazy Siwan" returns!

Id: [0x001034E4]
You look well, Khenut. How are the farmers?

Id: [0x001034E5]
They and the rebels are all changed men. Since that… vile woman was dealt with, there has been almost no trouble. There has been little to do but farm. It is going to be a good year.

Id: [0x001034E6]
In fact, some of the rebels are helping look after children orphaned by Ptolemy soldiers.

Id: [0x001034E7]
They are babysitting? And they call me crazy?

Id: [0x001034E8]
You'll help? Wonder of wonders. I will give you a list.

Id: [0x001034EA]
Should be no problem for one as resourceful as you. Haha.

Id: [0x001034EB]
Now that I would welcome my boy, they say that it's venomous sting will paralyze a man instantly. I could have some use for that!

Id: [0x001034EC]
Medicinally speaking of course!

Id: [0x001034ED]
Of course. Farewell, Theramenes.

Id: [0x001034EE]
Spare a moment for a poor old sot?

Id: [0x001034EF]
Will none of you help me? A manticore stole my eyes!

Id: [0x001034F0]
Farewell Bayek! And watch out for manticores!

Id: [0x001034F1]
It is done and my son Khemu is at peace.

Id: [0x001034F2]
Since Flavius came? It cannot be coincidence.

Id: [0x001034F4]
Praxilla! Praxilla!

Id: [0x001034F5]
Is this poor witless thing your doing?

Id: [0x001034F6]
Did Praxilla tell you where she was going?

Id: [0x001034F7]
The priestess?

Id: [0x001034F8]
No, no my lord Flavius, please…

Id: [0x001034F9]
Bayek!

Id: [0x00103502]
Call off your rabid dog, Praxilla!

Id: [0x00103503]
Killing me does nothing.

Id: [0x00103504]
Semper Flavium.

Id: [0x00103505]
You must stop Melitta, Bayek.

Id: [0x00103507]
After what she did? I would have slit her throat myself. Thank you, for me, for Balagrae, it is more than I would have asked.

Id: [0x00103508]
By the gods, what has happened?

Id: [0x0010350C]
Villagers! Let's go.

Id: [0x00103510]
It's on the road to Alexandria. Could you find Hermes and bring him home to me?

Id: [0x0010351A]
You should be grateful, you serve Rome now.

Id: [0x0010351B]
And the work will be over soon.

Id: [0x00103524]
Don't you ever get sick of saying so many good byes?

Id: [0x00103525]
Your land will not die, Praxilla. You are its healer, its protector, its Medjay.

Id: [0x00103526]
Part of me, yes. But it is part of the journey and on it I find those who give me hope.

Id: [0x0010352A]
What is that sound… voices? Ghosts? Demons?

Id: [0x0010352C]
I need to find the source of the chanting.

Id: [0x00103534]
Sarcophagi inscribed with the mark of Serqet. How much death does she require?

Id: [0x0010353A]
This is probably the work of the cult of Serqet.

Id: [0x0010353C]
Likely the work of the cult of Serqet.

Id: [0x0010353E]
The cult of Serqet did this.

Id: [0x00103540]
The cult of Serqet is responsible for this.

Id: [0x00103547]
What is this insolence? Who dares to intrude upon our most sacred work?

Id: [0x00103549]
Sacred? A trail of death led me here. This cavern reeks of the profane. Are you the bloody hand responsible?

Id: [0x0010354B]
All of the souls were chosen from lesser faiths. But we study their organs, and read the signs. Soon we will know Serqet's secrets, and become immortal.

Id: [0x0010354D]
This was your last chance to win the goddess's favor. Let's test your immortality, shall we?

Id: [0x00103550]
This place, the shrine. It prickles with divine power.

Id: [0x00103551]
The Oracle is drawing me to her, I can feel it.

Id: [0x00103552]
A lake of tears high in the mountains? Apollo means me to find this Halo of the Huntress.

Id: [0x0010355E]
Let's go. They'll notice soon enough!

Id: [0x00103566]
The goddess Serqet is she who tightens the throat, and the one who lets us breathe. I do her will, I am her sting.

Id: [0x0010356B]
Keep the mask and staff of the goddess as poor tokens of our respect.

Id: [0x00103573]
I arrived too late to save this one. You will be the last victim of this cursed ritual.

Id: [0x00103680]
The ravings of a madman.

Id: [0x00103684]
Profane ravings to the gods.

Id: [0x0010368B]
I will speak to the priests he mentioned in his note.

Id: [0x0010368F]
Wait! You -- oh, that badge. You are the Medjay, from Siwa. [Iiwu.](Welcome.)

Id: [0x00103697]
Istellah and Hetanu aren't back yet.

Id: [0x00103698]
Teacher is going to punish them so much.

Id: [0x0010369A]
Did you hear that? She sent the Medjay to find Senib!

Id: [0x0010369B]
They are in so much trouble.

Id: [0x0010369E]
They won't stop hunting us until we are all dead.

Id: [0x001036A1]
I'm worried about the children. Istellah doesn't usually go adventuring for so long.

Id: [0x001036A4]
Thank you for agreeing to help us, Medjay. Anyone who fights against the tyranny of the Pharaoh is a friend of ours.

Id: [0x001036A7]
Get us out of here!

Id: [0x001036A8]
Destroy those neket iadets!

Id: [0x001036AA]
This way!

Id: [0x001036AF]
Have you found Hetanu?

Id: [0x001036B5]
Hetanu is a good student. He'll be a scholar one day. Istellah... I am training her. She is always protecting her friend. Strong. A good little warrior.

Id: [0x001036B9]
This is it.

Id: [0x001036BA]
Let's split up. We should be able to find traces of their presence faster that way.

Id: [0x001036C0]
I believe Hetanu is here. Stuck, inside the temple.

Id: [0x001036C1]
I'll stand guard while you retrieve him.

Id: [0x001036C2]
Found anything?

Id: [0x001036C3]
Not yet.

Id: [0x001036C4]
They were definitely here.

Id: [0x001036C5]
That's good. With luck, they are still alive.

Id: [0x001036C6]
Why can't the Pharaoh's soldiers just leave us alone?

Id: [0x001036C7]
We refuse their rule. Neither they nor their supporters can suffer us to live.

Id: [0x001036C8]
Then we'll just have to kill them first.

Id: [0x001036C9]
She knows to be careful. And she'll bring Hetanu back unharmed. She always does.

Id: [0x001036CD]
Over here!

Id: [0x001036D2]
A hidden entrance. It must lead inside the temple.

Id: [0x001036D5]
I will do what I can. But do not forget, I have my own justice to pursue.

Id: [0x001036D6]
I knew I could count on you, seni.

Id: [0x001036E3]
That is all the items. Now to meet Taimhotep on the road to the pyramids.

Id: [0x001036E5]
Medjay, beware!

Id: [0x001036E6]
Istellah is smart. Upon seeing the bandits, she would have known to vanish, and find a hiding place. Amunet favors her.

Id: [0x001036F1]
(scream of fear)

Id: [0x001036F3]
Watch out! Do not let the snakes get you!

Id: [0x001036F4]
And -- please do not let the snakes get me!

Id: [0x001036F6]
Be careful!

Id: [0x001036F7]
Yes, you got it!

Id: [0x001036F8]
Watch out!

Id: [0x001036FA]
You got them all!

Id: [0x001036FE]
I wonder who took it.

Id: [0x001036FF]
I told Istellah to take the shield, so she could get out. But the spear was too heavy for us.

Id: [0x00103703]
But that was hours ago and I am worried. She should have been back with help by now. If she is not with you… something must have happened to her.

Id: [0x00103706]
She used the shield for protection. Not a single snake touched her!

Id: [0x00103708]
Why did it have to be snakes? I hate snakes.

Id: [0x00103710]
Well. Perhaps not whole. But it would have been a dire fate nonetheless.

Id: [0x00103711]
I trust you have learned your lesson.

Id: [0x00103715]
Istellah has yet to return.

Id: [0x00103716]
Best you head out. Knowing Istellah, she's found more trouble.

Id: [0x00103719]
I hope Istellah is safe.

Id: [0x0010371A]
Have you been to the camp yet? Was Istellah there?

Id: [0x0010371D]
Smoke. It is coming from the camp.

Id: [0x00103721]
Curse you, fiends!

Id: [0x00103723]
Medjay. I am afraid we still need your help.

Id: [0x00103727]
I am so happy to see you, Khamet!

Id: [0x00103728]
Over here, Medjay!

Id: [0x0010372D]
Thank you for saving Istellah. Now you must stop Medon. He will destroy us all.

Id: [0x00103730]
Thank you for ridding us of Medon. But Istellah is still being held at the citadel. Please, find her.

Id: [0x00103734]
They'll think twice before they attack us again. Thank you for your help, Medjay.

Id: [0x00103735]
They snuck up on us, attacked like cowards. But we showed them!

Id: [0x00103738]
He kept shouting about some treasure. Poor Istellah. She must be so scared.

Id: [0x00103739]
Are we talking about the same child? She's far more likely to gnaw at his throat with her teeth.

Id: [0x0010373A]
Have you found them yet?

Id: [0x0010373B]
Hiding in the haystack. She's got her escape plan all worked out.

Id: [0x0010373C]
Fear of demons kept the crime from being discovered.

Id: [0x0010373F]
Hapi, keep me safe.

Id: [0x00103746]
Bald, angry-looking, and with bodyguards... no doubt. Medon.

Id: [0x0010374A]
That filthy rebel rat is possessed by demons. She actually tried to stab Medon!

Id: [0x0010374B]
She should not have done that. He'll kill her sooner than later, now.

Id: [0x0010374E]
Did you see that shield? I wonder what other treasures that girl found.

Id: [0x0010374F]
Medon will get the information out of her. No one ever holds out when he questions them.

Id: [0x00103752]
May the gods be against you bastards.

Id: [0x00103754]
Blast, blast, blast…

Id: [0x00103756]
God of grain, watch over me.

Id: [0x0010375C]
Yes! Well done! Now go to our camp nearby! We'll be safe there!

Id: [0x0010375E]
What are you doing? No, the other way!

Id: [0x00103761]
Good riddance.

Id: [0x00103763]
I am your first judgement, Medon. Prepare to die.

Id: [0x00103764]
The gods will punish you harshly for what you have done.

Id: [0x00103768]
Those bodies. I wonder if the Hyena left something near...

Id: [0x00103769]
All those the Hyena killed. There must have been a reason to her actions.

Id: [0x0010376D]
Your friend is safe. He is back at the camp with the others. Where you should be, as well.

Id: [0x00103773]
I know, I know. Be more careful, Istellah. Stay out of trouble, Istellah.

Id: [0x00103774]
Thank you, brave warrior. That was a chariot ride worthy of Set himself! Did the rebels send you? Those men were going to kill me.

Id: [0x00103775]
Khaliset must have left some clue behind. Perhaps on those she killed...

Id: [0x00103777]
There is no need for that. But if you must, make the offering for my son. I would have loved to show him the spectacle of the Hippodrome.

Id: [0x0010377A]
On that day, come find me, young warrior. It will be an honor to fight by your side.

Id: [0x00103780]
Welcome home, Bayek. Siwa has missed you!

Id: [0x00103785]
Ma'at will judge you in the afterlife!

Id: [0x00103787]
The Devourer waits for your hearts!

Id: [0x00103789]
May the kas of those lost haunt you forever!

Id: [0x0010378A]
You would too, in my place. The Pharaoh's dogs seek to wipe us out and control everything. They do not understand. Life must flow freely, or else everything rots.

Id: [0x0010378C]
Bast watch over you, Medjay! I'll find you one day!

Id: [0x0010378E]
You really made an impression on Hetanu. He's been asking me for every bit of knowledge I have on the Medjay.

Id: [0x00103790]
Thank you, Medjay. It is a relief to have Sebni and the children back.

Id: [0x00103794]
Hey! That's my horse!

Id: [0x00103795]
You can't steal something already stolen, Mered!

Id: [0x00103797]
Yes, Bayek! Please return the horse to the stables for me!

Id: [0x0010379A]
Thank you again, Medjay!

Id: [0x0010379B]
I am so happy to be back here.

Id: [0x0010379C]
There are no snakes here. This is a good place.

Id: [0x0010379F]
Greetings, Medjay.

Id: [0x001037A0]
I'm going to ask Khamet for more warrior training. Just you wait.

Id: [0x001037A3]
Did you hear? The Medjay of Siwa found the children, and killed Medon.

Id: [0x001037A4]
The gods are looking out for us!

Id: [0x001037A8]
I still have a deal on which pyramid Khaliset hides in.

Id: [0x001037B3]
But let us speak of other things! The odds on your survival, friend. Oh, they are not good.

Id: [0x001037B4]
The Hyena's lair! It is in a pyramid.

Id: [0x001037B5]
She has hidden herself away to do awful things. She is smart, that Hyena.

Id: [0x001037B7]
A mummified heron. For resurrection? No, whoever did this must have known of Rudjek's place in the Order.

Id: [0x001037B9]
Rudjek does not deserve a tomb, but this is an insult. This tomb was made for a Pharaoh. Whoever did this has defiled this place.

Id: [0x001037C3]
This place was a beginning for me, and an end for Rudjek. The arrow marked both of those things.

Id: [0x001037CA]
Of course. But will she remember to bring herself back unharmed?

Id: [0x001037CC]
Please find them. Sebni is the only one who knows where those children have run off to.

Id: [0x001037CD]
Defeat our oppressors!

Id: [0x001037CE]
Too high. Cannot get out through the top. There must be another way.

Id: [0x001037CF]
[weeping]

Id: [0x001037D0]
Stop it. I told you I'll find us a place to sleep. Let me think a minute!

Id: [0x001037D4]
The Phylakes released by Gennadios! They're hunting for me.

Id: [0x001037D7]
What has become of the priest I questioned?

Id: [0x001037D8]
He died, my lord.

Id: [0x001037DA]
Round up the oldest villagers for me to question.

Id: [0x001037DB]
The oldest, my lord?

Id: [0x001037DD]
Find the names of any villagers who visit the temple regularly. I want to question them all.

Id: [0x001037DE]
Of course, my lord.

Id: [0x001037E0]
Fatigue grips me like a python. No one works as hard as I.

Id: [0x001037E1]
You are a martyr, my lord.

Id: [0x001037E3]
[yawns]

Id: [0x001037E6]
This food is inedible!

Id: [0x001037E7]
It is the best Siwa has to offer, my lord.

Id: [0x001037E9]
Is this meat? You know I do not eat meat.

Id: [0x001037EA]
I believe it is a local root vegetable, my lord.

Id: [0x001037EC]
My lord? My lord?... Ah, a well-deserved sleep.

Id: [0x001037EE]
Must you breathe so loudly?

Id: [0x001037EF]
Beg pardon, my lord.

Id: [0x001037F2]
The vault, the vault. The damned vault.

Id: [0x001037F4]
The sooner I can leave this god-forsaken piss-bog, the better.

Id: [0x001037FC]
Hmph! I swear this is meat.

Id: [0x00103800]
[snores]

Id: [0x00103804]
Here is the key to my warrior's chest. Make something of my legacy in this wretched world.

Id: [0x0010380B]
You will find the chest sunk in Mother Nile, a little south of here.

Id: [0x0010380F]
My wife would enjoy meeting you.

Id: [0x00103810]
Why is she not by your side? Keep her close, Medjay.

Id: [0x00103812]
I have given you my treasure. What else do you want?

Id: [0x00103814]
I have no more war stories for you.

Id: [0x00103818]
The guarding of temples was once a sacred duty entrusted to the Medjay.

Id: [0x00103819]
Now it falls to no one.

Id: [0x0010381A]
Find more priests!

Id: [0x0010381B]
One may have heard an ancient story or know about the vault.

Id: [0x0010381C]
The Commander became suspicious, so he took another hostage. If you had not rescued her, I think he would have killed her too.

Id: [0x0010381D]
I will deal with this murderer, I promise you.

Id: [0x0010381F]
Do you need help?

Id: [0x00103823]
Hilarus! How's the new… position?

Id: [0x00103824]
Ah, the Siwan Pretty Boy is back!

Id: [0x00103826]
It is not so different from the arena, actually. What with the constant screams and groans. The owner keeps me… busy.

Id: [0x00103827]
You old dog…

Id: [0x00103828]
Youth is a state of mind!

Id: [0x00103829]
If you do return to her, tell her that her Medjay friend fulfilled his… heroic task.

Id: [0x0010382C]
Have you heard the story of courageous Captain Phoxidas? The magnificent Greek mercenary who single-handedly defeated the despised Gabiniani in epic battle on the high seas?

Id: [0x0010382D]
Then gather around, and I will amaze you with the legend of Phoxidas and the Goddess of Siwa!

Id: [0x00103831]
You said goddess of Siwa? What was her name? Which battle are you talking about?

Id: [0x0010383A]
You have not heard? Oh, my friend, then you are in for a treat! Let me tell you how it happened...

Id: [0x0010383D]
Legend has it, the noble Greek captain and the Egyptian goddess sailed from Alexandria's golden coast, in search of the feared Gabiniani fleet.

Id: [0x00103843]
The sun god drove his fist into the mountain, took his beloved inside and spake. "None shall seek you. None but the Eagle. He will soar above the five cities with the Halo of the Huntress in his beak.

Id: [0x0010384A]
Whether by sea or between the sheets, the black land is conquered.

Id: [0x0010384C]
Zahra! How are you?

Id: [0x0010384D]
Bayek, I missed you! I have not stopped telling stories about the Medjay from Siwa.

Id: [0x0010384E]
Funny, I have not stopped dreaming of Zahra, the warrior farmer. The hero who saved Dionysias from the Son of Ra.

Id: [0x00103850]
Haha. You are the hero. You figure it out.

Id: [0x00103852]
When the Aten rises, those who bore the double crown will walk.

Id: [0x00103854]
A death among kings will set ablaze the house of Amun.

Id: [0x00103856]
If the Eagle spies the true ram, the descendants of Ra will fall.

Id: [0x0010385B]
I am sorry. My daughter heard the rumours of demons. She has a… vivid imagination.

Id: [0x00103866]
And she will cleanse herself at the sacred spring so that Apollo's song may enter.

Id: [0x00103867]
So shall the Prophetai give the God of Light an offering. Sacrifice a goat at the shrine's great altar.

Id: [0x00103869]
Over here! Stay low! We're near the bandit camp. Their guards can see us.

Id: [0x0010386F]
More of the Caretaker's handiwork. These unfortunate Greeks were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Id: [0x00103873]
They were just filthy beggars! Why do you care so much about them? No-one will miss them!

Id: [0x00103874]
We can talk about this! I'm wealthy! I can pay you!

Id: [0x00103875]
Name your price! You're being unreasonable!

Id: [0x00103876]
Filthy Medjay scum! You have no authority here!

Id: [0x00103877]
Who do you think you are? You can't touch me!

Id: [0x0010387B]
Where are my men?

Id: [0x0010387C]
Help me! Help! Soldiers!

Id: [0x0010387D]
Genuine treasures, all the way from Siwa. Would you like?

Id: [0x0010387E]
Rare treasures, straight from the hands of the gods!

Id: [0x0010387F]
Be quick! They are selling fast. Unique and valuable treasures from Siwa!

Id: [0x00103884]
Hey, how much do you want for that badge?

Id: [0x00103893]
Apollo will sweep the veil from her eyes, show her what will come to pass. So she may guide us.

Id: [0x00103894]
We give honor to Phoebe, Oracle of Apollo. For she is his flute here, in the land of the huntress.

Id: [0x00103895]
I thank Apollo for this sacred gift.

Id: [0x00103898]
I'm no actor, Simonides!

Id: [0x0010389B]
And I'm no playwright, but [in vino veritas](in wine there is truth), Diocles!

Id: [0x001038A8]
I should go and see Praxilla.

Id: [0x001038B0]
Catchy title.

Id: [0x001038B1]
He'd be the first to admit it's drivel, but we're hoping a festival will restore some goodwill. To that end I have one last favor to ask…

Id: [0x001038B2]
No acting required?

Id: [0x001038B3]
Ha, ha, ha... Leander's villa should return back to the people, but without the deed that's impossible.

Id: [0x001038B9]
Bayek! Did you hear? I gave birth to an opus. It burst forth from my creative loins!

Id: [0x001038BA]
You er…

Id: [0x001038BB]
I wrote a play my dear fellow. Of our exploits!

Id: [0x001038BD]
O' Meander, scourge of Cyrene, I Hiocles will stop your scurrilous schemes!

Id: [0x001038BE]
Ha, ha, I changed the names no-one will know.

Id: [0x001038C0]
I am the Egyptian Eagle, sent by Ra to punish you! Caw! Caw!-- Is that how an eagle calls?

Id: [0x001038C2]
Come, let us raise a cup of wine to our savior, the furious and fecund Dimonides! (not reciting) Hm… That one might be a little too much.

Id: [0x001038C8]
That architect is a good man.

Id: [0x001038CA]
I've heard his public works have revitalized South Cyrenaica. I would love to meet him in person.

Id: [0x001038CE]
I dread to think what they'll do with it. Certainly not appreciate the function and form of the modern approach to architecture.

Id: [0x001038D2]
You found it? Praise Jupiter!

Id: [0x001038D3]
They were sad to lose it.

Id: [0x001038D9]
We will see about that. And your friend Crios?

Id: [0x001038DA]
I am teaching him the healing arts.

Id: [0x001038DB]
But I sent him out a day ago to the east hills to gather herbs and he's not returned. I was just about to go look for him.

Id: [0x001038DC]
Is it… no I will not dare to hope.

Id: [0x001038E7]
I have someone I need to see and I will join you.

Id: [0x001038E8]
I will join you when I find Crios.

Id: [0x001038EC]
Where better to find the deed but hidden quarters?

Id: [0x001038F1]
Hmm. Sounds like a few bandits are roosting up top.

Id: [0x001038FA]
These peasants are stubborn. But I must persevere for the greater good.

Id: [0x001038FD]
(coughs)

Id: [0x00103906]
(spits)

Id: [0x00103908]
(tries to clear throat)

Id: [0x0010390A]
(feels the sand in his teeth)

Id: [0x0010390C]
Senu… Aya… where are you my love?

Id: [0x0010390E]
Khemu… I am failing you… please don't… hate me.

Id: [0x00103910]
Come and meet me, coward!

Id: [0x00103914]
You fight like a man without passion.

Id: [0x00103915]
[Laughing] This is who they send after me? The bugs on my beasts are fiercer!

Id: [0x00103917]
You would be best to give yourself up, Khaliset. I know your pain.

Id: [0x00103919]
Egypt will be well rid of you!

Id: [0x0010391A]
You call yourself a Medjay? You sully that badge!

Id: [0x0010391B]
You are handy with a weapon, I will give you that.

Id: [0x0010391D]
No child would want this from their parent, Hyena!

Id: [0x0010391E]
Do not speak of what my child wants!

Id: [0x0010391F]
I will defeat you, fool.

Id: [0x00103920]
Are you ready to be part of something greater than yourself, Medjay?

Id: [0x00103921]
Lay down your weapon. It will be faster that way.

Id: [0x00103925]
May you find your daughter in the afterlife, Khaliset. May the Lord of The Duat guide you.

Id: [0x00103927]
I need to get back. May Hapi ensure your beer cup never runs dry.

Id: [0x00103978]
Yes, yes Diocles, I understand your argument, but function should not be the only consideration.

Id: [0x00103979]
You are making him blush, Vitruvius.

Id: [0x0010398F]
Don't worry about me. You must find the bust of Icarus for mother.

Id: [0x0010399F]
Throw harder!

Id: [0x001039A4]
[ono of relief] Found my notes on the gene sequencing code.

Id: [0x001039A7]
Are you ever gonna tell Milton that you tested it with his DNA?

Id: [0x001039AA]
Here's the genetic sequencing code. Not that I'll ever get to use it again.

Id: [0x001039AE]
You shouldn't have come here.

Id: [0x001039AF]
At least we belong here.

Id: [0x001039B0]
Finally, someone we can kill.

Id: [0x001039B3]
Come forth by day, and I will guide you home.

Id: [0x001039B6]
Dammit, my notes!

Id: [0x001039B7]
I'll have to track them all down.

Id: [0x001039B8]
A false pharaoh is no true ruler of ours. Defiance is our only option.

Id: [0x001039C2]
How are things coming along?

Id: [0x001039C3]
Still making preparations.

Id: [0x001039C4]
Good luck, seni.

Id: [0x001039C6]
Any luck finding Aya?

Id: [0x001039C7]
Yes, she's hiding beneath the streets of Alexandria.

Id: [0x001039C8]
She always finds something.

Id: [0x001039CA]
What news?

Id: [0x001039CB]
I've killed the Snake. But I fear that my journey is not yet complete.

Id: [0x001039CC]
You have not chosen an easy path, seni.

Id: [0x001039CE]
You look troubled.

Id: [0x001039CF]
I was a fool. I've learned that the Snake is, in fact, many people.

Id: [0x001039D0]
You vowed to kill the Snake.

Id: [0x001039D2]
You have killed. I can see it in your eyes.

Id: [0x001039D3]
A madman known as the Scarab. He tried to build a city from sand.

Id: [0x001039D4]
The desert turns many mad.

Id: [0x001039D6]
What is it?

Id: [0x001039D7]
I have killed a woman known as the Hyena. She was eager to do anything for her dead daughter.

Id: [0x001039D8]
I see this troubles you, seni.

Id: [0x001039DE]
Bayek! You have returned.

Id: [0x001039DF]
A woman was willing to kill children. I put an end to her.

Id: [0x001039E0]
We live in a fallen world.

Id: [0x001039E2]
Bayek, you are back in Siwa.

Id: [0x001039E3]
I have lifted the curse on Memphis. Aya was there. She is devoted to Cleopatra.

Id: [0x001039E4]
She is a woman of conviction, your Aya.

Id: [0x001039E7]
Enjoy the hippodrome. Don't lose all your money at the races.

Id: [0x001039F7]
How does Aya fit into all this?

Id: [0x001039F8]
Her cousin Phanos informed me that she was a driven woman stalking deadly prey.

Id: [0x001039F9]
It so happened that I, also, had reason to bring down this prey. When Aya was successful, I stepped in to protect her.

Id: [0x001039FA]
We are grateful.

Id: [0x001039FC]
And we are grateful that you have eliminated Eudoros. He was an odious individual.

Id: [0x00103A01]
Can I ask why you wanted Eudoros dead?

Id: [0x00103A02]
As you know, Cleopatra's brother, Ptolemy, is too young and pliable to be a strong leader.

Id: [0x00103A06]
Here we are. The villa is up ahead.

Id: [0x00103A0F]
What does this lead to?

Id: [0x00103A10]
This door has been rigged with something dangerous. There's no way through here.

Id: [0x00103A1B]
She has since entered into our small circle. Cleopatra appreciates her bravery and quick thinking. We support Phanos in all he does to keep her safe.

Id: [0x00103A1F]
By the gods, what am I to do?

Id: [0x00103A20]
Peace, friend. What happened?

Id: [0x00103A21]
My-my thanks. My house is to the right of the entrance to the temple.

Id: [0x00103A22]
May you fly with the bright wings of Horus!

Id: [0x00103A25]
I think I understand what happened here.

Id: [0x00103A26]
Its colorful sail may lead me to other ships… and to Kawit.

Id: [0x00103A27]
We believe Eudoros was the force behind Ptolemy responsible for so many of Egypt's current ills.

Id: [0x00103A28]
The queen enjoys the life of high society. I'm pleased that Aya is bringing some sober substance to Cleopatra's social circle.

Id: [0x00103A29]
She is an extraordinary woman, your wife.

Id: [0x00103A2A]
You will learn more at the villa.

Id: [0x00103A2E]
Enough, Sebni. Children will be children. Let's just find them.

Id: [0x00103A2F]
I'll go with you. Sebni will go back to the chasm camp. Where it is safer for dreamers to be.

Id: [0x00103A46]
The Medjay is here! Fight! We can defeat them!

Id: [0x00103A47]
You cannot defeat me, Medjay. Come and face me!

Id: [0x00103A4E]
You should s-speak to Ramessu. He knows everyone in town, and everything that happens here.

Id: [0x00103A51]
I'm sure he does.

Id: [0x00103A58]
You know nothing of my pain!

Id: [0x00103A5B]
Tell me about the children.

Id: [0x00103A5D]
Yes! Run that one over!

Id: [0x00103A5E]
One time, long ago, I chased the Hyena down myself. But you're not interested in that! You're interested in Mered's wares!

Id: [0x00103A5F]
Thanks again for that horse, friend. But... had to sell him on.

Id: [0x00103A60]
I bet you wish you could work for ol' Mered, eh Bayek? Think of the life! But, no, he's already got his men.

Id: [0x00103A61]
I had an unbreakable sword! I thought of you, but, another buyer came around. Business.

Id: [0x00103A62]
Did I tell you of the time I ate a scorpion? I have no feeling in my mouth whatsoever.

Id: [0x00103A64]
I know.

Id: [0x00103ABA]
The citadel is in the southwest mountains. Medon patrols between here and the citadel. Just look for an angry bald man, surrounded by bodyguards.

Id: [0x00103ABC]
Stupid girl. Thinks she can hide treasure from me, does she? She will talk soon enough. Everyone talks under the heat of the iron.

Id: [0x00103ABD]
Torture her to death, no doubt. Good riddance.

Id: [0x00103ABF]
Well, hopefully she'll tell us about that treasure before he goes that far.

Id: [0x00103AC6]
Medjay, help me!

Id: [0x00103AD0]
You are Khati, yes?

Id: [0x00103AD1]
I will not ask how you knew, but for the future of Egypt, we must flee.

Id: [0x00103AD3]
How did you find me, Medjay? Did the spymaster send you?

Id: [0x00103AD4]
The Centurion's list led me here.

Id: [0x00103AE2]
Egypt is sending spies against us! Is Caesar not an ally of their queen?

Id: [0x00103AE4]
That's what happens when alliances are forged between the sheets.

Id: [0x00103AEE]
There is another spy in Balagrae? He's in great danger.

Id: [0x00103AF0]
Aegyptus continues to breach the conditions of friendship and send her agents against us.

Id: [0x00103AF1]
Any of Apollodorus' men found operating in Cyrenaica will be executed. Anyone helping foreign agents in Cyrenaica will be executed.

Id: [0x00103AF2]
This is the proclamation of the Senate and people. Roma gloriae semper.

Id: [0x00103B05]
There is another spy, Khati at the East Roman Fort. I should rescue him.

Id: [0x00103B0D]
I am an Egyptian like yourself, Medjay. For the safety of Egypt please, we must escape.

Id: [0x00103B10]
Are you Gupta?

Id: [0x00103B11]
Yes! Did Apollodorus send you? No matter, we must escape.

Id: [0x00103B19]
Help me, Medjay!

Id: [0x00103B1A]
I will not die like this.

Id: [0x00103B1C]
For Egypt!

Id: [0x00103B1D]
Apollodorus will hear of your treachery!

Id: [0x00103B26]
Thank you sir Bayek! Get me out of this bloody cage! I'm hurt!

Id: [0x00103B3C]
Of course you do. Don't worry you're safe now.

Id: [0x00103B3D]
Thank you, Sir Bayek.

Id: [0x00103B41]
Paulus Aurelius is starting to reek and it's making me heave.

Id: [0x00103B45]
By the gods! Stop the lion, he's eating Metrobius!

Id: [0x00103B46]
Help, the lion has escaped!

Id: [0x00103B4D]
I need to get rid of that lion before I can confirm my suspicions.

Id: [0x00103B4E]
Yes! The Egyptian has no fear! He will save you, Metrobius.

Id: [0x00103B4F]
Metrobius is dead you fool, but at least we stand a fighting chance.

Id: [0x00103B56]
I heard screaming coming from the brothel!

Id: [0x00103B57]
By the gods, I hope everyone is alright.

Id: [0x00103B5B]
That's it mother, it's all finished and I will join you and father soon.

Id: [0x00103B5F]
I'm too late!

Id: [0x00103B68]
I should return to Sminthos.

Id: [0x00103B6C]
Tonight you will witness the impossible.

Id: [0x00103B6D]
Wicked wonderment! Delicious, deepest dread.<CR>

Id: [0x00103B6F]
The gods will walk among us. Apollo, Athena, even the sickle wielder Cronos. He has come to guide our hero, Aeschylus, into the nethers.

Id: [0x00103B70]
I am Aeschylus. The afterlife is either a daring adventure, or nothing.

Id: [0x00103B75]
Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages… Do you have an interest in the fantastical and bizarre?

Id: [0x00103B76]
A hungering for the phantasmagorical?

Id: [0x00103B78]
You look troubled.

Id: [0x00103B79]
Cleopatra has seduced Caesar into her camp. Aya hopes that together, they will improve the lives of all Egyptians.

Id: [0x00103B7A]
Forgive me, but I am skeptical.

Id: [0x00103B7C]
It is always good to see you back, seni.

Id: [0x00103B7D]
Pothinus is dead. But Cleopatra has betrayed us.

Id: [0x00103B7E]
The powerful, Bayek, fight to keep their power.

Id: [0x00103B82]
You have come back.

Id: [0x00103B83]
Just to visit. I've missed you.

Id: [0x00103B84]
I pray to Amun for you every day.

Id: [0x00103B86]
Bayek. You've returned to Siwa.

Id: [0x00103B87]
It is still my home.

Id: [0x00103B88]
And will forever be, my dear.

Id: [0x00103B8A]
Good to see you, Bayek.

Id: [0x00103B8B]
Is all well, Rabiah?

Id: [0x00103B8C]
It is as it is. I try to help the best I can.

Id: [0x00103B8E]
Ah, my dear Bayek.

Id: [0x00103B8F]
Rabiah.

Id: [0x00103B90]
It is not the same without Hepzefa here, I know.

Id: [0x00103B94]
Camp Shetjeh? I think I have already solved your problem, Benipe. And I didn't even know it!

Id: [0x00103B96]
By the grace of Amun, that's all of them.

Id: [0x00103B97]
Bayek. I want to tell you... well...

Id: [0x00103B98]
What is it, Chenzira?

Id: [0x00103B99]
It's my fault about Khemu. They asked where you were and I didn't think it would hurt anybody if I told them.

Id: [0x00103B9A]
Chenzira, don't feel bad. You had no way of knowing what they would do. Anyone would have done the same thing in your place.

Id: [0x00103B9D]
I guess.

Id: [0x00103BA1]
Chenzira! Where were you?

Id: [0x00103BA3]
Are you going to tell mama and papo?

Id: [0x00103BA4]
Bayek says you have to.

Id: [0x00103BAE]
In a tomb.

Id: [0x00103BAF]
Chenzira. Remember, no more causing trouble.

Id: [0x00103BB0]
Me?

Id: [0x00103BB1]
Tonight we're going to explore the -

Id: [0x00103BB2]
Quiet!

Id: [0x00103BB3]
Were you scared?

Id: [0x00103BB4]
Of hyenas? No.

Id: [0x00103BB5]
What about scared of spirits in the tomb?

Id: [0x00103BB6]
A little.

Id: [0x00103BB7]
Oh... Sure... I'll tell 'em for sure.

Id: [0x00103BB9]
I require absolute silence when I work!

Id: [0x00103BBA]
Of course, my lord. Beg pardon, my lord. Never again, my lord.

Id: [0x00103BBB]
I said, quiet!

Id: [0x00103BBD]
This is frustrating. I feel I have the elements here, but cannot put everything together properly.

Id: [0x00103BBF]
So close. So very close.

Id: [0x00103BC2]
I am certain you will find the solution, my lord.

Id: [0x00103BC3]
Do not be such a pathetic sycophant!

Id: [0x00103BC7]
Please save my boy. He's not a criminal!

Id: [0x00103BCE]
Let me out you dogs! Release me or execute me. I will not rot in a cell.

Id: [0x00103BD2]
Yes, by the gods, thank you protector, but Egypt is in danger, I must get free.

Id: [0x00103BE0]
Navarch Metellus means to reach Egypt.

Id: [0x00103BE1]
Nothing will stop us. I'm proud to serve him and Rome.

Id: [0x00103BE5]
Three bolts of Tyrian purple. Eight jars of olive oil. Three amphorae of Cyrenaican wine. Eight bales of Silphium, and a hippopotamus.

Id: [0x00103BE9]
Psst, Sir Bayek! Over here.

Id: [0x00103BF3]
Perhaps the hunters should become the hunted?

Id: [0x00103C09]
Cyrene was a cruel mistress, Sir Bayek, but it's time to retire.

Id: [0x00103C0A]
You should use this boodle to really buy a farm you wanted, Mouse.

Id: [0x00103C0B]
Yes, I will. And make wine from my vines and cheese from my goats. Then one day we'll raise a cup to our friendship…

Id: [0x00103C0C]
You will miss her?

Id: [0x00103C0D]
Miss Romans kicking me to the street? Miss people spitting at my poor "cursed" face? No!

Id: [0x00103C0E]
That will be the best of days.

Id: [0x00103C13]
Here it is, the Black Crow and notes from the Roman dock-master!

Id: [0x00103C34]
I have visions of danger. A dark cloud looms over three heads.

Id: [0x00103C36]
One may be found near the Great Temple, one in its eastern district, and one in the tunnels that wind below it.

Id: [0x00103C42]
One of the dummies is sturdier than the other.

Id: [0x00103C44]
Best spot to hit is right in the head.

Id: [0x00103C46]
More arrows in the rack over there.

Id: [0x00103C4A]
Divine ones circle around him.

Id: [0x00103C4B]
I should report to the others.

Id: [0x00103C4F]
Keep low!

Id: [0x00103C51]
He is getting too close!

Id: [0x00103C52]
What would I do for them?

Id: [0x00103C54]
Do not leave the bodies out in the open!

Id: [0x00103C56]
They will not see him here.

Id: [0x00103C5F]
Hello, Toma!

Id: [0x00103C60]
Thanks, Maru.

Id: [0x00103C63]
Ptolemy. He has brought great sorrow to us all.

Id: [0x00103C65]
The statue has been destroyed, but not the men behind it.

Id: [0x00103C68]
My old Medjay outpost. I should bring Senu up there.

Id: [0x00103C6B]
Ah. The stone circle. I brought Khemu here not so long ago.

Id: [0x00103C6E]
You look at me like that again, I'll put your eye out.

Id: [0x00103C70]
Lazy peasants! Make yourselves useful!

Id: [0x00103C72]
Give me an excuse to cut you up. Any excuse.

Id: [0x00103C74]
You're a pathetic, submissive lot, you are.

Id: [0x00103C77]
If I had not brought Khemu here, would things have been different?

Id: [0x00103C7A]
Bandits. How dare they come to this sacred place?

Id: [0x00103C7E]
I never touched her, you neket iadet!

Id: [0x00103C7F]
And she says you did! Are you calling my wife a liar?

Id: [0x00103C80]
Are you calling me a liar?

Id: [0x00103C81]
Yes! A liar and adulterer!

Id: [0x00103C82]
Fine, then! If you're going to insult me like that, I did sleep with your wife!

Id: [0x00103C83]
[sigh] Beautiful Valeria…

Id: [0x00103C84]
You reeking bog witch! You'll suffer for this.

Id: [0x00103C85]
How dare you put a tongue so foul on sweet Valeria?

Id: [0x00103C86]
[howl of rage] I'm going to kill you!

Id: [0x00103C8C]
We'll speak of dreams once you find the adventurer, the philanderer, and the beggar.

Id: [0x00103C8E]
Deliver the amulets quickly. The threat gathers speed.

Id: [0x00103C90]
Search near the Great Temple and in the tunnels below it.

Id: [0x00103C96]
I've come too late to save this one.

Id: [0x00103C99]
Why are they shouting about private matters in the street?

Id: [0x00103C9C]
This man has indeed fallen on hard times.

Id: [0x00103CA1]
How much bread did he steal?

Id: [0x00103CA2]
All that was meant for the palace.

Id: [0x00103CA3]
The baker wants him executed.

Id: [0x00103CA4]
Please, I did it to feed my family!

Id: [0x00103CA5]
Shut up.

Id: [0x00103CA6]
This isn't his first time stealing, either. I've caught him at it myself.

Id: [0x00103CA7]
Should we just kill him now and be done with it?

Id: [0x00103CA8]
Oh, please, let me live!

Id: [0x00103CA9]
I said shut up! I can't think straight with you jabbering at me.

Id: [0x00103CAA]
Killing him's not a bad idea. Cleaner.

Id: [0x00103CAB]
But the captain will likely want to see to the execution himself.

Id: [0x00103CAC]
Who cares what the captain wants?

Id: [0x00103CAD]
What's that?

Id: [0x00103CAE]
Nothing.

Id: [0x00103CAF]
Please, please… [sobbing]

Id: [0x00103CB4]
Do you know the Seer?

Id: [0x00103CB5]
He sent help! Thank the gods!

Id: [0x00103CBA]
That is done.

Id: [0x00103CBB]
Freedom!

Id: [0x00103CBF]
As long as I am alive, my family still has a chance.

Id: [0x00103CC3]
My children's bellies cry out for food. I have no choice but to steal again.

Id: [0x00103CC5]
If only I had money to pay for what I must steal…

Id: [0x00103CC7]
I am not giving up on life yet.

Id: [0x00103CCB]
I wonder if Valeria's busy right now?

Id: [0x00103CCE]
Will no-one help my son? He's served Rome well!

Id: [0x00103CD0]
He's a deserter?

Id: [0x00103CD1]
I will not die on Roman soil.

Id: [0x00103CD3]
The Navarch of the Roman fleet at Apollonia Marcellus Asina, is planning an invasion.

Id: [0x00103CD4]
I'll remember that. Put it as your epitaph.

Id: [0x00103CD5]
The murderer of the money lender Paulus Aurelius, has been apprehended.

Id: [0x00103CD6]
The streets of Cyrene are safe again.

Id: [0x00103CD9]
I am one of Apollodorus' most trusted spies. Part of his divine manipulation of the threads.

Id: [0x00103CDA]
Someone betrayed us, gave up our agents in Cyrenaica. That is how the Centurion found me, he has a list of names.

Id: [0x00103CDB]
Then it cannot remain in his hands.

Id: [0x00103CDC]
He patrols the border towers. Find the bastard, see what information he has, what others can be saved.

Id: [0x00103CDD]
For a free Egypt. May our victories multiply.

Id: [0x00103CEB]
I will die before I betray Egypt.

Id: [0x00103CEC]
We are enemies!

Id: [0x00103CED]
But…

Id: [0x00103CEE]
The man wants a Pharaoh's ransom for the deeds, Sir Bayek. But Dolos the spirit of cunning sent you to help with my foolproof plan.

Id: [0x00103CEF]
I'm guessing this plan involves the Romans.

Id: [0x00103CF7]
And smugglers! So, will you join me on one last adventure, Sir Bayek?

Id: [0x00103CFF]
…and the smugglers return later for their loot.

Id: [0x00103D00]
We'll make a pirate of you yet! Steal the dock manifest from the Romans. It will tell us the Black Crow's route into the harbor.

Id: [0x00103D08]
O good prince, since the time of the oldest ancestors, The gods who lived in olden time…

Id: [0x00103D09]
The Masters and the Shining Ones! Who have been buried in their splendid tombs!

Id: [0x00103D0A]
The bodies of men shall pass away and disappear, therefore occupy thyself with thy pleasure daily.

Id: [0x00103D0B]
Enjoy thyself more than thou hast ever done before, enjoy the veritable goods of gods!

Id: [0x00103D0E]
(laugh) There is no farm, weasel. Never was.

Id: [0x00103D0F]
Here, your reward. Thank you from the depths of my heart… Bayek.

Id: [0x00103D10]
A man's heart is his own god. Goodbye… Sminthos.

Id: [0x00103D11]
At times I feel she is just reciting Aesop's fables to us.

Id: [0x00103D15]
Alexandrians! We are caught between two Gods, two Regal Children! Cleopatra and Ptolemy The Benefactor!

Id: [0x00103D16]
Which Ptolemy shall rule? For now it is the boy-king. Do we agree? Which Ptolemy deserves the throne?

Id: [0x00103D17]
Are we ruled by Greeks or gods? Pharaohs or frauds? Give Egypt back to the gods!

Id: [0x00103D1A]
Perhaps we can meet at the Oracle of Apollo? I will check on Vitruvius, that rare Roman dreamer.

Id: [0x00103D21]
Then I'll get it back before they use it for kindling, or worse.

Id: [0x00103D22]
A capital idea!

Id: [0x00103D31]
Ipuy! I will help him from here!

Id: [0x00103D32]
You need to go back and find Baba! Hurry! He might be hurt, or worse!

Id: [0x00103D36]
Hey there, are you hurt?

Id: [0x00103D38]
Argh! I twisted my ankle! My brother Baba was working further in. The tunnel collapsed. I don't know if he's alive.

Id: [0x00103D39]
I will get you out first, then find him.

Id: [0x00103D3A]
Careful! I think I heard a hissing sound nearby!

Id: [0x00103D3E]
You have brought us all together, Bayek.

Id: [0x00103D3F]
Cyrene's Triumvirate! Heralds of a new peace for this outpost of Rome.

Id: [0x00103D40]
To peace and order.

Id: [0x00103D41]
To love and weddings.

Id: [0x00103D42]
[Vade en pace](Go in Peace), Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x00103D43]
Didn't you plead your innocence?

Id: [0x00103D44]
I met with him, yes, but when I left the baths he was very much alive, drinking and whoring as usual. I am many things, but not a killer.

Id: [0x00103D49]
It is alright, Mouse, I believe you.

Id: [0x00103D4F]
Ptolemy is dead! Cleopatra is our Queen! Our gods will change again in Rome's favor!

Id: [0x00103D55]
Hmm. "I will cleanse Cyrene of the hedonists."

Id: [0x00103D56]
Another note.

Id: [0x00103D5D]
This Vesta has a flair for the dramatic. The whorer's wolf's den must be the local brothel.

Id: [0x00103D62]
The tunnel collapsed! Baba and Ipuy are trapped inside!

Id: [0x00103D63]
How can I help?

Id: [0x00103D64]
Are you strong enough to clear the way? See if you can bring them out. Please, neb, they are my brothers.

Id: [0x00103D67]
Stay here. I will do what I can.

Id: [0x00103D76]
You see the injustice here? He can't satisfy his wife, and somehow I am to blame!

Id: [0x00103D77]
A friend asks me to free you.

Id: [0x00103D78]
Well then! What are you waiting for?

Id: [0x00103D7A]
By the gods, this Vesta is insane.

Id: [0x00103D7F]
Take care of him. I will find your last brother.

Id: [0x00103D80]
Thank you, neb!

Id: [0x00103D89]
Then do it now, coward! Open this door and cut me down in the street!

Id: [0x00103D8A]
Show everyone what kind of man you are!

Id: [0x00103D8E]
I found the crescent-shaped mole on her right buttock particularly charming!

Id: [0x00103D8F]
I cannot stop and I will not live without her.

Id: [0x00103D91]
Come on, kill me! Why hesitate?

Id: [0x00103D92]
I'm ready to face the gods!

Id: [0x00103D93]
My only crime is bringing a smile to your wife's lips!

Id: [0x00103D94]
Come, little rabbit -- whisker me to death!

Id: [0x00103D95]
What will you do? Won't the Romans be searching for you?

Id: [0x00103D96]
I have a plan, a new life in Apollonia. Where you can taste the sea it is so close. Find me there if you can, Sir Bayek?

Id: [0x00103D97]
Good luck, Mouse.

Id: [0x00103D98]
Do not even think of taking that ring! You promised to get it for us, right friend?

Id: [0x00103D99]
Turo would never steal from us. Please find the ring, Medjay!

Id: [0x00103D9A]
That ring is a sacred object. For all of my family. We need it back!

Id: [0x00103D9B]
Go, Medjay. Be the man of honor you are! Return the ring to its rightful owners.

Id: [0x00103D9D]
I will found a town once I have this ring! Where is it, by the way?

Id: [0x00103D9E]
The ring, brother? You must have found it by now. No? Keep looking.

Id: [0x00103D9F]
You can return the ring to me, Medjay. It will be our little secret. I will even give you a cut.

Id: [0x00103DA2]
Have you the ring? No? Well, keep looking! Rashidi will make it worth your while!

Id: [0x00103DA3]
We need Anta, stranger! If we don't get her back...

Id: [0x00103DA4]
I see it now! You remind me of Anta. You have the same sort of voice.

Id: [0x00103DA5]
They never listen. It's dangerous to go outside the camp.

Id: [0x00103DA6]
Maybe teacher will give them over to camp leader for discipline.

Id: [0x00103DA7]
You mean cane them?

Id: [0x00103DA8]
Maybe?

Id: [0x00103DA9]
No. No one here would allow that. We left the Pharaoh's rule to stop things like that.

Id: [0x00103DAA]
It will be fine. The Medjay will fix things. That's what he does, right?

Id: [0x00103DAC]
I wonder if I'll be bigger than you when I'm older.

Id: [0x00103DAD]
I want to protect people when I grow up, too! Maybe even help Anta protect other littles.

Id: [0x00103DAE]
Have you seen Anta yet, stranger?

Id: [0x00103DAF]
Anta smells a bit better than you. She's always going into the Oasis to get clean!

Id: [0x00103DB1]
Notes on Alexander the Great, and the temple. And many wild theories as to what treasures might be here.

Id: [0x00103DB2]
Child!

Id: [0x00103DB6]
I'm going to have to force a way through.

Id: [0x00103DB8]
What happened?

Id: [0x00103DBC]
Get us out of here.

Id: [0x00103DBD]
I'd like to say I'm capable of walking, but that would be a lie.

Id: [0x00103DBE]
Set aside your pride. I'll carry you.

Id: [0x00103DCC]
Fine. I suppose wearing it will make my mother happy.

Id: [0x00103DEA]
Peace, Wadjet. Forgive me for killing your green ones. There is no other way through.

Id: [0x00103DEC]
That crazy old Seer's amulet couldn't protect me from a flea's bite.

Id: [0x00103DEE]
That guard's going to be sorry he crossed me.

Id: [0x00103DF2]
That is all three amulets given out. Now to return to the Seer.

Id: [0x00103DFD]
Yes. One arrived too late to protect its bearer.

Id: [0x00103E06]
And so it was proven that Ptolemy was a false pharaoh. Not a god, not an Egyptian even. Nothing but a puppet.

Id: [0x00103E07]
They called us heretics. Stole the Pissa Oros Citadel from us, and hunted us down.

Id: [0x00103E08]
But other people, they know the Pharaoh is a bad man, right, Nawa?

Id: [0x00103E09]
That's right. But they are too afraid to speak out. And not without cause. There are those in high positions who will do anything to keep their power.

Id: [0x00103E0A]
It is dangerous to speak out against the Pharaoh. And that is why, with Sebni away, we will discuss politics.

Id: [0x00103E0B]
Which?

Id: [0x00103E0C]
The adventurer. He met a lonely end, bitten by a snake.

Id: [0x00103E0D]
I am not the one taking bets on your life, though. It is some other fool here! Hear that! Mered will take no slander against his friend!

Id: [0x00103E0E]
Bring me there, and I will tear aside the curtain that shrouds your nightmares.

Id: [0x00103E2F]
I swear, I know exactly which pyramid she is in. I think.

Id: [0x00103E31]
Thank you for rescuing us. (sigh) This is my fault. By Anubis I swear, I just wanted them to dream a little! If only I had not told them those stories.

Id: [0x00103E35]
Now, Deliverer, tell me what you saw.

Id: [0x00103E36]
I saw… I saw what has lain behind my eyes every night for the past year.

Id: [0x00103E37]
It begins with a sandstorm.

Id: [0x00103E38]
I rise to my feet and walk a corridor of ruins, passing into the Hall of Judgement.

Id: [0x00103E39]
There, a twin of myself places a black stone heart onto the scales of Ma'at.

Id: [0x00103E3A]
It is then that the god-snake strikes -- Apep, larger than a mountain, larger than reason.

Id: [0x00103E3B]
A bow of light appears in my hands. I fight the snake and win, though, not without injury.

Id: [0x00103E3C]
Then I rise through dark, choking waters to surface among lotus flowers.

Id: [0x00103E3D]
I claim my lost heart from an altar and travel to the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00103E3E]
In the distance I see my son. When I reach for him, he turns to ashes.

Id: [0x00103E3F]
He…

Id: [0x00103E41]
Thus is your true seeing unbound.

Id: [0x00103E42]
[sobs]

Id: [0x00103E4D]
This is the wrong way, Deliverer.

Id: [0x00103E4F]
We have strayed from our course.

Id: [0x00103E52]
Tell me more of your dream.

Id: [0x00103E53]
People will blame Istellah for this.

Id: [0x00103E54]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00103E55]
She is loud, and outspoken. He has the adventurer's heart. Istellah protects. People just don't listen.

Id: [0x00103E58]
They are loyal to each other.

Id: [0x00103E59]
They are good children.

Id: [0x00103E5F]
Chief Nito. You look well! How goes the work?

Id: [0x00103E60]
It is a pleasure to see you again, Bayek. The great work continues.

Id: [0x00103E65]
Do it, then!

Id: [0x00103E66]
Go beneath the waters south of here, and bring up the statue of Khnum from the Sunken Temple of Ramses.

Id: [0x00103E67]
With this likeness of the Great Potter to hand, the ritual can be performed.

Id: [0x00103E74]
Grow, O light… Come forth, O light…

Id: [0x00103E75]
Rise, O light ascend, O light… You who are without, come in.

Id: [0x00103E76]
O darkness, remove yourself from his eyes.

Id: [0x00103E77]
O God of seeing, bring in the light to him!

Id: [0x00103E78]
O Apep who coils in the abyss, be turned aside!

Id: [0x00103E79]
Devoid of moisture, come forth from the stream!

Id: [0x00103E7A]
As your sail bends to yesterday, accept him as a passenger on your divine ship!

Id: [0x00103E7B]
Khnum, stand beside him and be his champion!

Id: [0x00103E7F]
How do you fare, Deliverer?

Id: [0x00103E80]
My mind is more peaceful.

Id: [0x00103E81]
Tonight, your sleep will come without dreams.

Id: [0x00103E82]
I am grateful for your help.

Id: [0x00103E83]
Memphis is grateful for yours.

Id: [0x00103E99]
What is this place?

Id: [0x00103EE3]
Damn you!

Id: [0x00103EE7]
A record of the old city, from long before any of us were born. They sealed these up for the gods.

Id: [0x00103EFB]
I am. You should see me race.

Id: [0x00103EFD]
They then returned here to pay respect to Rudjek, if these candles are any indication.

Id: [0x00103F1E]
Would you let me write your story? The last Medjay would be a fantastic tale.

Id: [0x00103F1F]
Well, what kind of story would you tell, Tefibi?

Id: [0x00103F20]
I know! A fable! One to put even Aesopica to shame! I will make you a camel, I think.

Id: [0x00103F21]
I do not think I would like to be a camel.

Id: [0x00103F22]
A shame that. Maybe an eagle? How about a cow

Id: [0x00103F23]
Perhaps it is best to continue on from here in silence.

Id: [0x00103F24]
Ah. So be it.

Id: [0x00103F28]
So long and thanks for all the fish, Berkeley! March 21st 2006 --- the day Layla Hassan drops out of college. That's right, Professor Moore, I'm not finishing that Jane Eyre paper. I got a job, and I'm headed to Philly next week. This whole “classroom thing”? It's not for me. Mom and Dad are freaking out, but they'll accept it. I'll be working towards something real, making real money – and, I'll be closer to home. Not that I'll visit any more often. Sophia promised there would always be a place for me at Abstergo, as long as I show them what I can do with a circuit board and a pair of pliers. Sure, I'll have to work my way up to a place on her “special project”, but that doesn't matter. It won't be long before she or her father, [posh british accent] Mister Alan Rikkin, notices what I'm capable of and asks for my help on the Animus.

Id: [0x00103F30]
There! Get that map-thief!

Id: [0x00103F31]
There's the rat that stole from us!

Id: [0x00103F32]
Get that thief!

Id: [0x00103F33]
Get back here, you gutless snake!

Id: [0x00103F34]
The Phylakitai know what you've done, thief! We will not let that pass!

Id: [0x00103F36]
Whoa. Feeling a bit... dizzy. I think I lost a lot of blood.

Id: [0x00103F37]
Then it is time we get you back to your mother.

Id: [0x00103F38]
The soldiers in the temple? My dear Rabiah, I solved your problem without knowing it. I have already run that gang off.

Id: [0x00103F3C]
Rahotep! What will you do now?

Id: [0x00103F3D]
Look after my village, and care for my father. He has earned his rest. The leadership is my burden now.

Id: [0x00103F3F]
And we will hunt down every one of those demon bandits. Not one will be left alive, I swear it.

Id: [0x00103F40]
We won't stop until the Son of Ra's influence is gone from the land. No farm will ever burn again.

Id: [0x00103F49]
Go back to Egypt, with the rest of the liars and slaves.

Id: [0x00103F51]
I will look into it, don't worry.

Id: [0x00103F5C]
Hey! Get off him. Leave him alone!<LF>

Id: [0x00103F60]
Who are you? You want some too? Ok, come on then, hero!

Id: [0x00103F64]
I know Sminthos is not the murderer, but I must discover who is.

Id: [0x00103F71]
Take some time to rest, analyze your performance. Fight with extreme ka, be a god, and do not forget! The top of the lighthouse at sundown!

Id: [0x00103F76]
I will feed your heart to vultures.

Id: [0x00103F79]
You stole everything from me!

Id: [0x00103F84]
Sobek the merciful will keep you and your children safe regardless of your offerings.

Id: [0x00103F85]
He of the splashing waters wants your devotion first. If you make offerings, do it freely and without guilt. It is not required of you.

Id: [0x00103F86]
Padiaset, my friend. I see you have retired the sword and returned to preaching.

Id: [0x00103F87]
Bayek, welcome! Yes. There is a lot of work to do to regain the trust of the people.

Id: [0x00103F88]
One by one those loyal to Sehetep are being brought back to sanity. It is a slow process, but Sobek helps us.

Id: [0x00103F89]
It is a worthy task. I know of no-one better fit for it than you. Good luck, seni.

Id: [0x00103F8B]
The fields were scorched before He came. Livestock barren. Where His sandaled feet trod, the land became fertile.

Id: [0x00103FA0]
You must listen to me, seni. It was the temple's Embalmer who killed them all. He was the Man-Beast.

Id: [0x00103FA1]
Then what about the body parts all around his house? Maybe that Embalmer was the killer, but that old lunatic was involved!

Id: [0x00103FA2]
The Embalmer gave those people to crocodiles. They were torn apart in front of an audience! The body parts were just brought here by the river.

Id: [0x00103FA3]
Maybe, maybe not. I still don't trust him. I don't want my children anywhere near him.

Id: [0x00103FA4]
The Embalmer is dead. You are safe now.

Id: [0x00103FA5]
I will sleep easier knowing he's gone. I owe you my life, Medjay. If only I could convince my neighbors that old man is innocent.

Id: [0x00103FA6]
My name is the Mouse!

Id: [0x00103FAA]
Bayek! Kill these swindlers!

Id: [0x00103FAB]
You're in trouble now my friend is here!

Id: [0x00103FAC]
They trussed me up like a hog!

Id: [0x00103FB9]
A spectral spectacle!

Id: [0x00103FBA]
No, no, I told you leave a pause there for the audience to gasp in fear.

Id: [0x00103FBB]
Those of them that are still awake…

Id: [0x00103FBC]
But I think that is Vesta's second victim.

Id: [0x00103FBD]
Stay strong, Metrobius! Dionysus will save you.

Id: [0x00103FBE]
Poor beast! Vesta must have released him to distract us from her handiwork.

Id: [0x00103FBF]
"Metrobius took his final bow. Only the Whorer remains and he will die at the Wolf's den."

Id: [0x00103FC0]
Bayek!

Id: [0x00103FC1]
Mouse?

Id: [0x00103FC2]
They are going to kill me!

Id: [0x00103FC3]
Shut up, you're convicted of murder.

Id: [0x00103FC4]
Hold on Mouse!

Id: [0x00103FC7]
Vesta, Vesta… what is your problem with pleasure seekers?

Id: [0x00103FC9]
Phanos would be appalled if an actor were to die.

Id: [0x00103FCA]
Our play will never see the light of day! My first big part, and it's ruined, ruined!

Id: [0x00103FCB]
Metrobius would have wanted us to continue performing it!

Id: [0x00103FCC]
Metrobius is a Martyr for Art and Theatre. Our play will go on.

Id: [0x00103FCF]
We will bury Metrobius underneath the theatre. And yes, we will continue to act.

Id: [0x00103FD1]
Why did you kill them all? I have tasted darkness too, but you are mad.

Id: [0x00103FD2]
You cannot understand what it is to be born into flames. To be born a piece of dust. I am ash.

Id: [0x00103FD3]
I hope the Duat figures you out.

Id: [0x00103FD4]
Those beasts look antsy… are you sure they're locked up?

Id: [0x00103FD6]
My poet friend Phanos used a similar ploy in Alexandria.

Id: [0x00103FD7]
Now is our time to emerge from the madness, Bayek of Siwa.

Id: [0x00103FD8]
O glory, a protector of Egypt, please, we are in grave danger.

Id: [0x00103FDA]
We serve the true pharaoh!

Id: [0x00103FDB]
Thank you for stopping, my husband was a protector like you. I have screamed myself hoarse for days. No one cares.

Id: [0x00103FDC]
What seems to be the problem, nebet?

Id: [0x00103FDD]
Why not.

Id: [0x00103FDE]
Yes! Hie! Hie!

Id: [0x00103FDF]
The snitch told me the smuggler's ship has a codename. Corvum nigrum, the Black Crow.

Id: [0x00103FEA]
My dearest, we do not have enough to pay Sefetu his accursed taxes. When he comes, I will talk to him about selling myself into bonded labor.

Id: [0x00103FEB]
No, no, you don't have to! I confessed our plight to Lady Maharet and she gifted me a purse, full of coins. It will buy us a month or two.

Id: [0x00103FEC]
That family is so generous! We must make a libation to the gods in their honor!

Id: [0x00104011]
That old mute was skulking around again.

Id: [0x00104012]
Isn't he from some rich family?

Id: [0x00104013]
Maybe. Maybe that's why no one has chased him out of town.

Id: [0x00104014]
I think he lives up at the Taharqa estate.

Id: [0x00104039]
Did you see the poor crazed wretch trying to talk to Harkuf? He made the strangest sounds!

Id: [0x0010403A]
Who? Old Ghupa?

Id: [0x0010403B]
Is that who that was?

Id: [0x0010403C]
Yes. You should be kind to him. A terrible tragedy.

Id: [0x0010403D]
Why? What happened?

Id: [0x0010403E]
How do you not know? He was attacked and had his tongue cut off!

Id: [0x0010403F]
That was him!?

Id: [0x00104040]
Yes. Harkuf takes pity on him and spends a lot of time with him.

Id: [0x00104065]
Did you have any trouble bringing your crops to market?

Id: [0x00104066]
I'll say! Getting past Camp Pyrrhos is torture. Those soldiers are thieving scum!

Id: [0x00104067]
Sefetu has given them a long leash.

Id: [0x00104068]
All they do is take advantage of us! It's not right!

Id: [0x00104069]
He who walks with Helios. Bringer of Peace. Herald of War. The liberator of this land.

Id: [0x0010406A]
Flavius is the Prophet of Rome. Roma incarnata!

Id: [0x0010406B]
Rome is Glorious. Rome is Radiant. Rome is eternal. Flavius is Rome!

Id: [0x00104070]
Walk, walk, into the flames. Flavius will burn away your crimes.

Id: [0x00104071]
The Lion's fire will cleanse you!

Id: [0x00104072]
Feel the searing heat of forgiveness.

Id: [0x00104079]
Keep off the silphium plants.

Id: [0x0010407B]
Soon that joyous land will be mine.

Id: [0x0010407D]
I think I know what dark deeds Khaliset was after here.

Id: [0x00104082]
Where is our loot?

Id: [0x00104083]
Come on, you metrokoites!

Id: [0x00104085]
Find it you sacks of uselessness!

Id: [0x00104093]
Eh? The Seer is gone!

Id: [0x00104094]
How did he leave the island?

Id: [0x0010409B]
I cannot wait until we get back. We really did find Alexander's treasure!

Id: [0x0010409C]
Maybe you could move this?

Id: [0x0010409D]
A sound idea.

Id: [0x001040A0]
Khamet!

Id: [0x001040A5]
That is not good.

Id: [0x001040A6]
Ah, excellent, we poets are unified in our cleverness.

Id: [0x001040A7]
The gods will not forgive you this evil!

Id: [0x001040A8]
He can usher in a new era now.

Id: [0x001040AD]
Get ready to move out! These vermin will be on the lookout.

Id: [0x001040AE]
We have been successful in finding the King's enemy!

Id: [0x001040AF]
We go now! Can't wait to see the King's face when we bring this villain in!

Id: [0x001040B0]
It is a good thing you are here. Can we talk?

Id: [0x001040B1]
When you are ready, we still need your help.

Id: [0x001040B5]
Lord Flavius, make Philippa my wife!

Id: [0x001040B6]
Pissa Oros. That is where he probably took her. No one ever comes back from there.

Id: [0x001040BA]
The statue of Khnum, Deliverer.

Id: [0x001040BC]
Bring me the statue that lies beneath the water.

Id: [0x001040BE]
[discordant humming]

Id: [0x001040BF]
Vitruvius is a friend of yours, yes? A visiting merchant said he saw him on the road near the citadel and he appeared to be in trouble.

Id: [0x001040C0]
[discordant humming]

Id: [0x001040CC]
Knowledge in the wrong hands is a sad waste.

Id: [0x001040CD]
Because she should be at this meeting of the great minds of Cyrene.

Id: [0x001040D0]
What of perfection of form, beauty for beauty's sake? It is obvious you appreciate that in other spheres, eh, Praxilla?

Id: [0x001040D2]
I will paint his name on every wall from here to Rome for the whole Republic to see.

Id: [0x001040D3]
Everyone will know the name of Flavius. Flavius the shining, the golden, the majestic, the most benevolent. All must know it, Flavius! Flavius!

Id: [0x001040D5]
Siwa needs you, Hepzefa.

Id: [0x001040D7]
Hepzefa. Where are you now, my friend? Walking in The Field of Reeds?

Id: [0x001040D9]
Hepzefa. I could use your help now, seni.

Id: [0x001040DC]
What has become of the necropolis? We used to keep it pristine here. Out of respect.

Id: [0x001040DE]
Animals. Using the necropolis as a den. No wonder it looks like this.

Id: [0x001040E0]
Grandfather, I have missed you. I only wish you could've known Khemu.

Id: [0x001040E4]
The scribe himself. Drunk and dead to the world.

Id: [0x001040E9]
Yes... There...

Id: [0x001040EA]
Who're you? Gerroff...

Id: [0x001040EB]
Mmm. Smells nice.

Id: [0x001040EC]
Urgh...

Id: [0x001040ED]
Gonna... throw up.

Id: [0x001040EE]
Whossit?

Id: [0x001040EF]
Ohhh. Hrm.

Id: [0x001040F0]
Lookit!

Id: [0x001040F1]
(Mutters).

Id: [0x001040F2]
Gotta...gotta tell them to pile the grain. Those priests are wrecking everything.

Id: [0x001040FD]
This symbol. A dedication to Serqet, the goddess of magic. The scorpion.

Id: [0x001040FF]
What was worth the danger of crossing the Order?

Id: [0x00104100]
A priest of Anubis… but is it Hetepi?

Id: [0x00104102]
Another priest of Anubis.

Id: [0x00104104]
How many priests does one city need?

Id: [0x00104105]
Much has happened, Khemu.

Id: [0x00104107]
I have come to visit, son. Just for a moment.

Id: [0x00104109]
Khemu. Your mother and I speak of you all the time.

Id: [0x0010410F]
Someone has been here recently…

Id: [0x00104111]
This room… This is where my quest began.

Id: [0x00104112]
Someone has taken great care of this chamber.

Id: [0x00104114]
It's blocked. There must be some way through. The tracks here are fresh.

Id: [0x00104116]
Something must be behind here.

Id: [0x00104117]
It should be clear now.

Id: [0x0010411B]
After I stabbed that bastard, things went dark. When I came back to myself, Rudjek was dead.

Id: [0x0010411D]
Rudjek's body should have been left to rot. He has been laid to rest with respect by someone who wanted him to enter the Duat prepared.

Id: [0x0010411F]
Whoever buried him also left this heron mummy to honor Rudjek with his gods damned namesake in the afterlife.

Id: [0x00104120]
And then what will happen to her?

Id: [0x00104121]
The same as anyone else they've caught. A quick death, if she's lucky.

Id: [0x00104123]
Or a slow agonizing death, if she's not.

Id: [0x00104126]
Gaia kept up quite an exchange of letters.

Id: [0x00104127]
I could learn more about her from reading these.

Id: [0x00104129]
Hepzefa, old friend.

Id: [0x0010412B]
I miss our talks, Hepzefa. And drinking beer!

Id: [0x0010412E]
This must be the rebel child!

Id: [0x00104130]
It is peaceful here, son.

Id: [0x00104132]
Oh, Khemu.

Id: [0x00104134]
Such a foul human being. He dies now.

Id: [0x00104136]
I hope Medon gets information on the rebel leaders from her. That way we can just kill the vermin, and get out of here.

Id: [0x00104137]
He will. And the Pharaoh will cover us in riches upon our triumphant return.

Id: [0x00104138]
Hey. Over here!

Id: [0x00104139]
(low whistle)

Id: [0x0010413D]
Head for the rebel camp just south of the Citadel! Go!

Id: [0x0010413F]
That's right! Head for the big pile of rocks with trees! We have a camp there!

Id: [0x00104141]
We're there!

Id: [0x00104145]
Did those rebels send you? How pathetic!

Id: [0x00104148]
Now you face the gods' judgement.

Id: [0x00104149]
After I'm done with you, I will wipe out every last one of those rats.

Id: [0x0010414C]
Now to find the Citadel, and save the child.

Id: [0x0010414D]
This should offer some measure of respite to the rebels.

Id: [0x00104150]
What's this?

Id: [0x00104151]
That leads to the docks. I can't believe Phanos had you go through the pit.

Id: [0x00104159]
Don't forget to get Alexander's shield back from Medon! Stomp him good!

Id: [0x0010415A]
As you wish, young warrior!

Id: [0x0010415B]
Nonsense. The gods are on my side! And I shall keep all the riches from the Temple, with the Pharaoh's blessing!

Id: [0x0010415F]
The scribe must have moved on. There's no sign of him or the guards.

Id: [0x00104160]
It was good of them to send the Medjay our way.

Id: [0x00104161]
Truly, we are blessed, for being worthy of his protection.

Id: [0x00104162]
Right. Until the children find more trouble again.

Id: [0x00104163]
Well, yes. Though they were right about the treasure.

Id: [0x00104164]
And they will not ever let us forget that.

Id: [0x00104165]
I should keep looking. He must be close by.

Id: [0x00104174]
I can read my own name, nek!

Id: [0x00104176]
Broken spears. These Romans really did try everything.

Id: [0x00104178]
A beautiful night sky. It is nice up here.

Id: [0x0010417E]
Bayek. We've been looking for him for so long -- and you found him.

Id: [0x0010417F]
Technically Abstergo found him.

Id: [0x00104180]
Yes, but you lived him.

Id: [0x00104181]
I can't wait to hear the stories you have to tell.

Id: [0x00104185]
Stay away from my laptop!

Id: [0x00104186]
I should, shouldn't I? It's a terrible invasion of privacy.

Id: [0x00104187]
Just think of it as me reliving your memories.

Id: [0x00104188]
Bayek's a corpse. I'm alive.

Id: [0x00104189]
You're right, and I apologize.

Id: [0x0010418D]
[chuckling] These articles on "hidden chambers"… Always so misguided.

Id: [0x00104190]
Always missing crucial information.

Id: [0x00104194]
[Eh da](What's happening)! A little personal space, huh?

Id: [0x00104195]
These modifications are brilliant! What you did with the dialysis unit…

Id: [0x00104196]
You'll have to meet Rebecca. You two will get on like a house on fire.

Id: [0x00104197]
And then probably set a house on fire.

Id: [0x0010419B]
They really did a number on it, didn't they?

Id: [0x0010419C]
It's a rental. Ruby Tuesday's back home in Philly.

Id: [0x0010419D]
You named your vehicle Ruby Tuesday?

Id: [0x0010419E]
Why not?

Id: [0x001041A1]
I like entrepreneurs, free spirits, money makers. You love to fight, I love to make money. Together we can do both.

Id: [0x001041A2]
Youth is a state of mind! It is up here. (whistles)

Id: [0x001041A6]
Your husband will meet you in the Field of Reeds when it's time. But it's not a place to rush to. He would want you to live now, and be happy.

Id: [0x001041A7]
I didn't want to waste my life sewing and weaving for my father. Then I met my husband and we eloped. We didn't have much, but we were happy here.

Id: [0x001041A8]
Hello Tuaa. I see you've taken up street performing.

Id: [0x001041AB]
Bayek! Ha-ha. Not really. I just find the poetry reading comforting. It helps me.

Id: [0x001041AC]
I am glad to hear it.

Id: [0x001041AD]
I've yet to work up courage to face my father. One step at a time.

Id: [0x001041B4]
I will pay for my crimes, Flavius.

Id: [0x001041B7]
The Lord Flavius is our Muse.

Id: [0x001041B8]
We offer you our true expression, God who walks among us.

Id: [0x001041B9]
I will dance till I can dance no more.

Id: [0x001041BA]
Flavius has made us his Maenads.

Id: [0x001041BB]
He has given me ivy leaves to wear.

Id: [0x001041BC]
I give my feet in service of Flavius, the god of war.

Id: [0x001041BF]
Oh great and beauteous Flavius.

Id: [0x001041C0]
Unconquered, heroic, furious Mars, <LF>Rejoice in strife, and in the bloody wars.

Id: [0x001041C1]
Fierce you are, your mighty power can make <LF>The strongest peaks and deepest rivers shake.

Id: [0x001041CA]
He is the God who walks among us. His divine feet will stomp a path to Rome. And all who oppose him will fall.

Id: [0x001041CE]
So you will come back to Balagrae, with me?

Id: [0x001041CF]
If that is where you want to build our home.

Id: [0x001041D0]
You could do a lot of good there.

Id: [0x001041D1]
You already have, dearheart.

Id: [0x001041D2]
Shall I surrender or stir up the sudden flame by fighting it? Oh Flavius! I will surrender!

Id: [0x001041D3]
A burden becomes light when it is carried willingly. And I am so willing.

Id: [0x001041D5]
Your shining eyes, your raven hair, your manly gait, your skin so fair!

Id: [0x001041D6]
Flavius, you stride in splendor, like a lion. You stride, with vital breath, while mountains watch in awe.

Id: [0x001041D7]
Death has no dominion over the God who walks among us. But if you slept eternal, I would lie down and beg the ferryman to take me.

Id: [0x001041D8]
My tears would fall like a silent scream. Dew on the petals of the radiant rose.

Id: [0x001041D9]
There is no purer love than mine. I'll follow you through all divine.

Id: [0x001041DB]
My heart doth sigh with thought of you. I sit and yearn beneath the yew.

Id: [0x001041DC]
It's branches shield me from your sun. O' shining and exalted one.

Id: [0x001041DF]
An Ode to the Lion of Rome.

Id: [0x001041E4]
He's gone mad!

Id: [0x001041E5]
An ode to Flavius? He's lost his wits.

Id: [0x001041E6]
The guards should take him away.

Id: [0x001041E7]
And throw him in the sacred pool to cool off.

Id: [0x001041E8]
If you love Flavius so much, you should marry him!

Id: [0x001041EA]
You must stop and hear me! I will wither without the great Flavius' love.

Id: [0x001041EB]
I would kill my family for a night with the Lion.

Id: [0x001041EC]
What am I saying? Help me please, my love for Flavius threatens to consume me.

Id: [0x001041ED]
None can satisfy me, not you, or you, none but the proconsul of Cyrene!

Id: [0x001041EE]
I dabbled in it.

Id: [0x001041EF]
We have got another fight to finish. This way.

Id: [0x001041F1]
(cries)

Id: [0x001041F2]
That Roman scum Flavius forced me to murder my child, my only son.

Id: [0x001041F3]
(cries)

Id: [0x001041F4]
My sweet, smiling angel, innocent as a lamb.

Id: [0x001041F5]
(wails)

Id: [0x001041F6]
When I refused to follow his damned soldiers, work on his weapons. He…

Id: [0x001041F7]
I… I couldn't stop myself, my beautiful son, he was only five years old. Look how pale and white he is.

Id: [0x001041F8]
No! No! (wails)

Id: [0x001041F9]
I will follow you soon, my dear heart, to the fields of reeds. Flavius will not part us.

Id: [0x001041FA]
(tortured sobbing)

Id: [0x001041FC]
You are a fine leader, Rahotep. Egypt needs more like you.

Id: [0x001041FE]
His teeth will tear the flesh of those that oppose him.

Id: [0x001041FF]
I tremble before you, Leontius Magnifico.

Id: [0x00104200]
Hie, hie! Sing in praise of Him with the mane of gold.

Id: [0x00104208]
We need no creed, no indoctrination. We do not lurk in the shadows. We stride in the light.

Id: [0x00104209]
Our only desire is that the world be as it is. A place of Order, Symmetry. Harmony. The gods crave them.

Id: [0x0010420A]
Out of the yawning veil of nothingness, the stygian void of Chaos, Gaia emerged.

Id: [0x00104216]
All the blood has been washed away, but some green paint remains. Perhaps it is fitting. Some things should not be forgotten.

Id: [0x0010421A]
That we live without any form of laws and restraints.

Id: [0x0010421B]
We say should the thief be free to steal your cattle? Should the murderer be free to extinguish the life of your son?

Id: [0x0010421E]
You cannot stop us. We will have our new world. Pay no heed to the enemies of knowledge.

Id: [0x0010421F]
May the Father of Understanding guide us all.

Id: [0x00104221]
They do not understand that the fabric of the universe is not woven from the threads of chaos, but of order.

Id: [0x00104222]
There is a real murderer out there. He is killing my friends!

Id: [0x00104224]
I was at the bathhouse meeting some associates, and suddenly a legion accosted me.

Id: [0x00104225]
The Romans have closed off the baths, I should look for another way in.

Id: [0x00104229]
There may still be clues to the real killer at the bathhouse.

Id: [0x0010422B]
The stench of death and something else, perfume?

Id: [0x0010422C]
What will you tell me, Paulus Aurelius?

Id: [0x0010422D]
"My next tragedy will strike down Cyrene's greatest Actor - Metrobius." And it is signed. Vesta?

Id: [0x00104231]
Why is Vesta targeting these men? Could she be a prostitute killing off her clients?

Id: [0x00104235]
Gods protect us! The lion, the lion has escaped!

Id: [0x00104236]
A pretty name for a killer. She's at the Neorion Naval Arsenal, to the South.

Id: [0x00104237]
The really tricky part was making their eyes bleed. Now that took skill, and years of research.

Id: [0x0010423D]
My instincts were right, Vesta's a prostitute. But she is looking for her father, I only hope I find him before she does.

Id: [0x00104250]
I'll wait for you by the docks at the basin of the Great Temple.

Id: [0x00104251]
The arrival of a child is a blessed event.

Id: [0x00104253]
Anubis awaits you.

Id: [0x00104255]
I liked Paulus. Sad we have to bury him.

Id: [0x00104256]
The Mouse will be executed. Justice will be served.

Id: [0x0010425A]
These are the tunnels the Seer mentioned. I'm on the right track.

Id: [0x0010425B]
The Mouse made a mess of the body.

Id: [0x0010425C]
No footholds here. I need to find a way into another room.

Id: [0x0010425F]
This must be the philanderer. The danger foretold was real.

Id: [0x00104260]
These scarabs must be coming from somewhere.

Id: [0x00104261]
Forgive me great Amun. I have need of this.

Id: [0x00104262]
You're quite the fighter.

Id: [0x00104263]
I do my best. They caught me off guard the first time.

Id: [0x00104264]
Ready for a fight, Medjay?

Id: [0x00104265]
Always.

Id: [0x00104267]
These must be the bandits the historian spoke of. I wonder where they are keeping the Sword of Ptah.

Id: [0x0010426E]
Here. The sacred island awaits our coming.

Id: [0x00104271]
I must get back on the ship of Ra.

Id: [0x00104274]
Stay close, Deliverer. Sobek's children threaten.

Id: [0x0010427A]
I cannot proceed without you!

Id: [0x0010427D]
My incantations will protect you!

Id: [0x0010427F]
Back, Crocodile of the West, who lives among the Setting Stars!

Id: [0x00104281]
Back, Crocodile of the East, who lives on foulness!

Id: [0x00104283]
Back, Crocodile of the South, who lives among impurities!

Id: [0x00104285]
Back, Crocodile of the North, who lives on what lies between the hours!

Id: [0x0010428A]
Your son pissed himself when he saw the knife.

Id: [0x0010428C]
Is that the man I seek?

Id: [0x0010428E]
Hetepi hides among his brothers.

Id: [0x00104290]
Only one of these priests has to die. I must strike carefully.

Id: [0x00104291]
Watch out!

Id: [0x00104294]
These are nothing but tricks.

Id: [0x00104299]
This room has told me all I need to know.

Id: [0x0010429A]
The statue. I will bring it back to the Seer.

Id: [0x001042A3]
Completing this shrine was done by someone who cared for him. Rudjek's mistress, Suphia, seems the likely culprit.

Id: [0x001042A4]
It is misguided. But she has been dedicated.

Id: [0x001042A9]
[whoop of triumph]

Id: [0x001042AD]
A priest of Anubis is dead! Sound the alarm!

Id: [0x001042B1]
An intruder threatens the priests! We must defend them!

Id: [0x001042B3]
A priest of Anubis is dead! Catch the killer.

Id: [0x001042B5]
Find the man disturbing the temple's peace!

Id: [0x001042B9]
Are we close?

Id: [0x001042BD]
Move, metrokoites!

Id: [0x001042BF]
Keep going!

Id: [0x001042C1]
No stopping!

Id: [0x0010430D]
What are you waiting for, my love?

Id: [0x00104311]
No matter what, I know Rudjek's heart was found lacking. That bastard suffers in the afterlife, no matter what was done here.

Id: [0x00104318]
Yeah. Yours.

Id: [0x0010431B]
What a mess.

Id: [0x0010431C]
I will be judged one day, but I do not regret my actions. The feather will always be lighter than my heart.

Id: [0x0010431D]
One bar… no, half a bar.

Id: [0x00104343]
No, and neither are you.

Id: [0x00104347]
The fresh-water spring in the Amanai Cave. I know that cave. Better look into it.

Id: [0x00104349]
The Amanai cave. Aya and I used to come here as kids. Bandits must be inside.

Id: [0x0010434D]
Old blood staines this table. I think the body was prepared here. But crudely. This is no fine, skilled work.

Id: [0x00104355]
Bayek is used to ghosts.

Id: [0x00104357]
Here is my house.

Id: [0x00104376]
The expected result.

Id: [0x001043BA]
[clicking noise to urge them on] A good thing I came looking for you. I fear Nehi would be dead, and you'd be lion food otherwise.

Id: [0x001043BB]
[hums to the oxen]

Id: [0x0010457D]
Listen closely and you will hear how alone on the wide, naked Mediterranean sea the two fearless titans sent no less than sixty Gabiniani ships to the bottom of the ocean!

Id: [0x0010457E]
With only their sturdy trireme and loyal crew against the Gabiniani's fabled warships. Floating mountains carrying ten-thousand men, bristling with oars and fire...

Id: [0x00104587]
This works in our favour. We can work them down, ship by ship.

Id: [0x00104589]
So Phoxidas and the goddess sailed into legend, over the backs of ten times ten thousand drowned Gabiniani! I tell you I weep just to tell of it!

Id: [0x0010458B]
What a tale. The goddess' name was Aya. And a goddess she truly is. That may be the only honest part of the story.

Id: [0x0010458C]
What is truth? All is permitted in the realm of greatness! One must believe in the act of creation, or else they will join the Gabiniani!

Id: [0x0010458F]
Twenty warships? Pompey himself wouldn't claim so many.

Id: [0x00104590]
The Gabiniani were vanquished! All twenty mountainous warships lay in Poseidon's slimy embrace. Alone, and with the fury of the wind and sea railing against them, they prevailed!

Id: [0x00104592]
You must not doubt me! I was told it by someone who saw it happen!

Id: [0x00104598]
Silence… fell like fog. Suddenly one-hundred balls of fire leapt up from the Gabiniani decks and bore down upon Phoxidas and his stricken crew…

Id: [0x0010459A]
As if rising from the very depths of the Underworld, a second bristling wall of hulls appeared. This time an unbelievable forty Gabiniani death ships faced our lone heroes.

Id: [0x0010459B]
This may have been the largest fleet ever to sail the Mediterranean!

Id: [0x0010459D]
A vast, burning armada of war bore down upon them as if sent from Mars himself! The crew fainted, but were borne up again by the wild, thunderous cries of their fearless captain and the goddess!

Id: [0x0010459E]
The heroics were spectacular! They fought like gods! But it was all to no avail. Yet more ships appeared.

Id: [0x0010459F]
Then another ship rose behind the fleet, the size of which has never been seen before or since! Ten thousand warriors crowded it's massive deck smashing sword and spear against brazen shield.

Id: [0x001045A2]
What is that necklace you wear?

Id: [0x001045A3]
An old eagle skull.

Id: [0x001045A4]
I hope it brings us luck!

Id: [0x001045A5]
I'll stay up here and keep watch. When they show I'll give a signal. Then I'll attack from behind.

Id: [0x001045A8]
It fits. Should do the trick. Now it is a fine weapon.

Id: [0x001045A9]
Good bye Medjay.

Id: [0x001045AA]
He killed her to assure our compliance. For the village's sake I did nothing.

Id: [0x001045AB]
My mother lives, but my father is gone. I mean, I thought he was my father…

Id: [0x001045AC]
I'll find that scorpion that killed my husband! Haha!

Id: [0x001045AE]
We share Serapis.

Id: [0x001045AF]
Harmony is what we need. Not more senseless judgement.

Id: [0x001045B2]
The fresh-water spring in the Amanai Cave? I have already taken care of the bandits there.

Id: [0x001045B3]
I serve no one and I fight, for everyone.

Id: [0x001045B5]
There are so many of them!

Id: [0x001045B6]
I must get them!

Id: [0x001045B7]
Dear Amun, help me.

Id: [0x001045BB]
The farmers depend on this spring. They'll pay for sure.

Id: [0x001045D2]
Back to the Animus. What else can I do?

Id: [0x001045D4]
If the soldiers come, tell me and I'll pay them off.

Id: [0x001045D6]
Beat any passing farmers to a pulp, men. Let them know we mean business.

Id: [0x001045D8]
If you see that farmer again, bring him to me. I want to question him.

Id: [0x001045DB]
Gotta admit, this is damn good water. Damn good!

Id: [0x001045E0]
The best way to avoid this jerk is to get back in the Animus.

Id: [0x001045E2]
This place went unnoticed for a long time.

Id: [0x001045E4]
Looks like an hourglass.

Id: [0x001045E7]
This will be enough. Thanks to Neith, goddess of hunting.

Id: [0x001045EC]
Go team Paradise City. That was a good night.

Id: [0x001045EF]
[sobs]

Id: [0x001045F1]
Need that medkit.

Id: [0x001045F9]
Ancient Egypt's waiting for me.

Id: [0x001045FE]
Still haven't found Aya.

Id: [0x00104603]
Aya's DNA needs to go in the Animus.

Id: [0x00104607]
How's it going?

Id: [0x00104608]
Bad.

Id: [0x00104609]
Quite the view. The markers fit into place upon the capstone, and create a complete diagram.

Id: [0x0010460A]
You are remarkable! And, does it explain the riddle in the histories? About where to find the vault?

Id: [0x0010460B]
Mm-hmm. I suspect it meant something to the east of us. I could make out what looks like a ruined temple, now.

Id: [0x0010460C]
Follow me! I'll get us there!

Id: [0x0010460D]
These statues have survived the ages.

Id: [0x0010460E]
What do you see, hmmm?

Id: [0x0010460F]
The ground seems soft here. Let's see what is beneath the sand.

Id: [0x00104610]
Could this be for Rudjek? None could care for that snake that began this twisted quest, could they?

Id: [0x00104613]
Do me a favor and make sure Sophia Rikkin hears it.

Id: [0x00104617]
I shouldn't get too far from the cave.

Id: [0x0010461C]
How did you get your blade, Aya?

Id: [0x00104620]
"Gladstone Kittredge, Esquire"? You're fucking kidding me.

Id: [0x00104629]
This beast will be my death!

Id: [0x0010462A]
Gods save me from bandits and blasted camels!

Id: [0x0010462D]
Benipe's tools.

Id: [0x00104633]
Can you hear me? Baba! Ipuy!

Id: [0x00104634]
Are you ok?

Id: [0x00104635]
My leg is hurt. I don't know how bad.

Id: [0x00104636]
And Baba?

Id: [0x00104637]
I don't know. I can't see him. Get help!

Id: [0x00104638]
Please! Help! Quickly!

Id: [0x00104639]
I am here!

Id: [0x0010463A]
Take care of yourself. May the gods bless your little one.

Id: [0x00104641]
Can't believe that old ruin has so many valuables.

Id: [0x00104642]
Right? Stuff just lying around in the sand to be taken.

Id: [0x00104643]
I mean, if we didn't take it, who knows what would happen to it?

Id: [0x00104644]
Be lost to the ages. Now, if you ever have kids, they'll inherit something of value.

Id: [0x00104647]
Get me to a safe place! Then we will talk.

Id: [0x00104648]
I was going to kill all of them. That damn cage was too hard to get out of is all.

Id: [0x00104649]
Tell Apollodorus how brave I was. You and me, we make a good team.

Id: [0x0010464B]
What are you doing? Kill them!

Id: [0x0010464E]
I swear, I get more done reading the latest copy of Wired on the toilet than the rest of the guys do all day in the lab. I mean, the “Bodyband”? Really? If people can’t take a walk on their own, they aren’t going to listen to a watch that tells them to do it either. This is all so pointless. I should go back to… wait. That's probably what the Bodyband would tell me to do. What I should do is build something that will simultaneously blow people's minds and the doors off the Animus Project. Nothing at Abstergo Fitness is gonna be big enough for that. I'm bored as hell, but there's nothing like boredom to stimulate creativity. [clicks her tongue thoughtfully] Yup. I think the Bodyband needs a little adjustment to its language processing program.

Id: [0x00104659]
Apollodorus sent me to help you. Give me the scroll.

Id: [0x00104663]
The right decision always feels like home. My stuff's the same. My locker smells the same. It's like I never left. But I did… and I can never unlearn what I know now. How will it change my work at the Historical Research Division? Hard to say. All I know is that it will. Ardant booked us a lunch -- nothing fancy. She wanted me to meet Deanna Geary, my new medical officer. She looks like she was born in the middle of a cornfield, but she seems okay. I can't believe she left homemade cookies on my desk. I don't know why I told her about getting stood up last weekend. I never talk about personal stuff at work. At least it seems like I can trust her. You need that, to stay alive in the field. Too bad most of Abstergo's tactical units don't consider trust a priority.

Id: [0x0010466D]
What in the name of Horus are all these soldiers doing here?

Id: [0x00104670]
They look exactly like what was described in the writings of Manetho… fascinating. But what do they mean?

Id: [0x00104671]
The remains of this statue, the watcher, is supposed to be looking towards the entrance. But where is it now?

Id: [0x00104675]
Taxes have been delivered from the Giza region, sir.

Id: [0x00104678]
Keep watch over Ptolemy as he dribbles his porridge. Protect Septimius on his way to the brothels.

Id: [0x0010467B]
Palace duty, again.

Id: [0x0010467E]
Reports in from the provinces. Cleopatra seems to have at least some military support.

Id: [0x0010467F]
Very good. Has my, uh, collector's fee been deducted from the proceeds?

Id: [0x00104680]
It is even now being delivered to your private vault.

Id: [0x00104681]
Well done. Disperse a few drachmas to the men, would you? And take your usual remuneration.

Id: [0x00104682]
Cushiest job a soldier can get. Nothing ever happens here.

Id: [0x00104683]
Unless you count getting caught up in one of Ptolemy's tantrums!

Id: [0x00104684]
Do not inform Pothinus. It will make him impossible to deal with.

Id: [0x00104685]
But if the court is kept ignorant, how can we rectify the situation?

Id: [0x00104686]
I am not interested in rectifying the situation. I am interested in a contented Pothinus.

Id: [0x00104689]
I… I can read this!

Id: [0x0010468B]
As you command, sir.

Id: [0x0010468F]
[Aho](Here it is.) The portable Animus. No mention in the official credits, but all those emails, all those middle-of-the-night phone calls from Madrid… There's a lot of me in there. Sophia, if I'd known you just wanted to strip-mine my brain and leave me in the dark, I never would have followed you. Go away! There's no candy here! Nothing in life is ever free. Ever! The Animus… I can tell… I know it wouldn't have worked without my advice. Just look at how they did-- The heatsink, the VRMs, the high amperage rating by transistor… It was me who told them that it would offset failure of the-- What's this? Hello there, DNA reader module! Are you ringing my doorbell? Maybe there's some candy here after all…

Id: [0x001046A9]
I've come to the conclusion that Sophia is shit at hiring staff. The entire Madrid facility… [disgusted noises] How did they not see it? It would be so easy. You'd just have to parse the genetic memory input and work from smaller data pools. You could even process incomplete samples and still create a reliable model for high levels of synchronization. The reader module and the decryption software would need an update, but it's doable. Madrid's probably congratulating themselves just for getting this far. Meanwhile I'm partying with some congealed veggie curry, three plasma screens, a disassembled Animus, and Rha Victoria's debut album on loop. [Fe Sehetak](Cheers)! Dee will be mad when she sees how I used Milton's DNA, but what did she expect when she asked me for help? I needed someone's genetic profile to test the Animus, and, well… his was right there. All in the name of science.

Id: [0x001046C1]
Aya said that the Royal Scribe is often at the bath house. I will kill that [neket iadet](piece of shit) Eudoros there.

Id: [0x001046C7]
Where to now my love?

Id: [0x001046C9]
After you Aya.

Id: [0x001046CA]
That was one big crocodile...

Id: [0x001046CB]
About time you showed up!

Id: [0x001046CC]
I was guarding your rear.

Id: [0x001046CD]
My rear is fine.

Id: [0x001046CF]
The man who killed my son. Cowering in another temple.

Id: [0x001046D0]
Your Medjay friend Hepzefa also had a stubborn streak. Like your son.

Id: [0x001046D1]
Why didn't you kill me when you had the chance in Alexandria?

Id: [0x001046D2]
This must be the artefact the bandits stole from Merkes. Strange thing.

Id: [0x001046D3]
Hmm. This plain-looking artefact must have some hidden value if it was stored among such treasures.

Id: [0x001046D9]
I like morning briefings. They're short, minimal on nonsense, and they have free coffee. No downtime this week. They're putting me and Dee on a plane to Alexandria two days from now. I don't get why Hathaway is in such a rush. We're being deployed to extract an… Artifact. If it were a "Person of Interest," the push would make more sense. A person can be halfway across the world in a couple of hours. But an artifact that's been sitting around for two thousand years? It's not going anywhere. “An Artifact of High Interest.” Heard that before. It always ends up being some crappy pottery shard or half an old book. My Animus runs on DNA, not tableware. It'll be strange, visiting Egypt for the first time since 2013. Back then, I went looking for my roots, and found trouble instead. It's good that Dee's coming. She always keeps me from doing anything too stupid.

Id: [0x001046E6]
There's more than one way to donate your body to science.

Id: [0x001046EA]
Turns out the “Artifact of High Interest” is also a “Person of Interest.” A mummy. And a golden opportunity. I've informed Dee of some changes I'm making to our assignment parameters. She acted mad, but I know she's eager to see my Animus field-tested. Abstergo won't mind. Well, they would if they found out. But they won't. [laughs] Hathaway's intel was a disaster -- they have no idea what's going on with this extraction. Field tech is fun and all, but that's not why I left Berkeley. If the Animus lets me ride DNA this old, if the reader can model the missing codons and extrapolate the genetic memories that aren't mine, Sophia would lose her… Abstergo. Abstergo will come to me on their hands and knees. My name will be right up there with Warren Vidic's. [Ana mouta'akida min da](I can see it now.) Too bad the Madrid facility got blown up. But I bet they'll build a new one soon. This one will be in Philly, and its lead engineer will be Layla Hassan.

Id: [0x001046FC]
We're chasing a wild hare with that fool. He's an idiot or a madman.

Id: [0x001046FD]
He said the lost vault he is looking for is brimming with gold and gems. We could be kings!

Id: [0x001046FE]
Bah! That artifact we took from him is a worthless rock.

Id: [0x0010470B]
The scorpion strikes. The poison bites. I watch light fall away.

Id: [0x0010470C]
A face once flushed by violent love, is turned to ash and grey.

Id: [0x0010470D]
But greater than death's bitter scheme, the claws and stinging tails.

Id: [0x0010470E]
A feather white and gold as light, to weigh on Ma'at's scales.

Id: [0x00104710]
The path is steep, I climb, I climb, with heavy feet.

Id: [0x00104711]
And heavy eyes, I weep, I weep with poisoned tears.

Id: [0x00104712]
To reach the peak, I watch, I watch the broken nest.

Id: [0x00104713]
I make the leap, and fall, and fall, and land in peace.

Id: [0x00104715]
What is this ache? Oh that's right, the stump of my lost innocence is aching sadness, and I am awake while the rest of the world sleeps.

Id: [0x00104716]
But I am alright. It's okay. I only wish the love that died had not left brightness, to trouble night with the memory it keeps.

Id: [0x00104717]
I was there when I died. Lived through the awful tearing, died in the quietness. And death is fair, only Horus weeps.

Id: [0x00104718]
I have to go. I have another reading. It's childish stuff, really. Don't judge harshly!

Id: [0x00104719]
I make no promises. Good-bye Tuaa.

Id: [0x0010471D]
Whoah! What's that man doing up there?

Id: [0x0010471F]
They take our gods and turn them into abominations. Serapis!? Half Greek, half Egyptian, all whore of Alexandria!

Id: [0x00104720]
And who does all this work to build Greece on top of Egypt? Egyptians of course! Last week our brother Metjen died while working on the temple. His wife just gave birth to their first son!

Id: [0x00104724]
Those lying Greeks are working us to death, tearing down our own temples! This is what their culture means! The death of Egypt and Egyptians!

Id: [0x00104728]
The old gives way to the new under the mighty hand of Serapis! Serapis, a god Greek and Egyptian alike call their own. Together, we will create a new culture. Culture for all!

Id: [0x00104729]
We are leading the Faiyum, the very heart of Egypt, into a new and glorious age. This is our shared destiny. A stronger Faiyum, a fairer Faiyum. A Faiyum full of culture and knowledge.

Id: [0x0010472A]
Under the watchful gaze of the Nomarch himself, all of Karanis is being rebuilt according to a grand masterplan. The ugly Egyptian slums are being torn down, replaced by stately Greek temples. Culture for all!

Id: [0x0010472B]
Prosperity for all! Latest census figures show increased wealth for all in Faiyum. Thanks to the Great Ptolemy's aid for Greek investors, profits have continued to multiply.

Id: [0x0010472F]
Prosperity for all! With increased acquisition of Egyptian land and the use of Greek farming methods, farms in the Faiyum now have more success than ever!

Id: [0x00104730]
Security for all! An increased military presence throughout the Faiyum has made life safer for everyone. Egyptian slums are being torn down, rebuilt, or segregated. Greek settlement is more secure than ever. Security for all!

Id: [0x00104731]
Culture for all! Greek and Egyptian knowledge joins in a new climate of restoration. The Faiyum is being raised above its humble beginnings. Guided by the principles of Greek civilization, Greece and Egypt live together in peace. Culture for all!

Id: [0x00104732]
Trade activity has increased tremendously, creating substantial economic growth for Greek business throughout the Faiyum. Prosperity for all!

Id: [0x00104733]
The new Faiyum promises peace and plenty. A new age of wealth under the guidance of Greek innovation! Prosperity for all!

Id: [0x00104737]
The desert is giving way to a more civilized land.

Id: [0x0010473B]
The Roman presence here is zealous, and oppressive.

Id: [0x0010473F]
I cannot stop till Flavius' heart is in my fist.

Id: [0x00104740]
At least that is what the Romans would have people believe.

Id: [0x00104744]
This must be the farm Aya spoke of.

Id: [0x00104748]
Flavius will not escape me again.

Id: [0x0010474A]
A lush land of pastures and fields. Trampled on by Roman occupation.

Id: [0x0010474C]
Flavius will not stop until he reaches Rome.

Id: [0x00104750]
I will cut your heart out.

Id: [0x00104755]
You robbed my son of his afterlife!

Id: [0x00104756]
You murdered my son, my friends…

Id: [0x00104757]
You will be judged in the Duat.

Id: [0x00104758]
You are not a god, you're barely a man.

Id: [0x00104759]
Enough, face me!

Id: [0x0010475D]
We are free of those Roman tyrants.

Id: [0x00104761]
This is a massacre! What in the gods happened here?

Id: [0x00104765]
Crios? What has Flavius done to you?

Id: [0x00104769]
There is something beneath this. A hidden cellar?

Id: [0x0010476D]
Where's my sword!

Id: [0x0010476E]
Futuo te! Come and claim it!

Id: [0x00104772]
Flavius is making the people of Cyrenaica vomit out his lies.

Id: [0x00104775]
Flavius has made this man his mouthpiece.

Id: [0x00104778]
They think Flavius is their god! What madness is this?

Id: [0x0010477B]
What sick and twisted things has Flavius made these men do to that animal!

Id: [0x0010477E]
They're fighting over the love of a beast?

Id: [0x0010477F]
There is a great sickness here!

Id: [0x00104780]
(laugh) A goat? They lay with a goat!

Id: [0x00104782]
Flavius has taken their wits. This is not good, or natural.

Id: [0x00104783]
Will they dance till their feet bleed?

Id: [0x00104785]
Get away from me!

Id: [0x00104786]
This woman is mad!

Id: [0x00104787]
Cease bothering me, whore.

Id: [0x00104789]
That poor woman, Flavius has taken her from her husband, her child.

Id: [0x0010478B]
Another son that shit-eater has murdered.

Id: [0x0010478D]
People act against nature! Could Flavius really do this?

Id: [0x0010478F]
This is sacrilege! Flavius has made himself a god in their minds!

Id: [0x00104792]
It's just Order of Ancients propaganda. Flavius has turned you into the enemies of freedom.

Id: [0x00104794]
A Love poem? There's no end to Flavius' sick games.

Id: [0x00104799]
Seems Apollonia is not only a cargo port, but the center of the Roman fleet in Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x0010479B]
Lions and other wild animals are exotic and expensive cargo. Must be why there's so many guards.

Id: [0x001047A4]
So this the shining city of Cyrene? Let's see how Romans have brought so-called civilization to the Greeks here.

Id: [0x001047A6]
Geb's laughter shook the coast until this city fell into the sea.

Id: [0x001047AA]
It is nothing but ruins. Swallowed up by the earthshaker.

Id: [0x001047AC]
After leaving the olives to dry on grass mats they crush them for their oil.

Id: [0x001047B0]
Whoah. By the gods… how can this place exist?

Id: [0x001047B1]
I will soak Cyrenaica with Flavius' blood. For my son and yours.

Id: [0x001047B6]
Is this a chariot wheel? Reminds me of the Hippodrome races.

Id: [0x001047B9]
They are drying silphium. The farmers use it for animal feed, and the healers as a medicine.

Id: [0x001047BD]
They are preparing the bodies for cremation. I wonder what soil these soldiers died upon? Cyrenaica or Egypt.

Id: [0x001047C6]
This place is a haven for travelers. A welcome rest spot on their journey.

Id: [0x001047CB]
Such terrible desecration of the dead. The Romans are little more than animals.

Id: [0x001047CD]
The Romans aren't content with torture. They must make a mockery of the corpses.

Id: [0x001047D1]
Offerings and prayers to the Oracle from the great and good of Cyrenaica.

Id: [0x001047D4]
These filthy bandits have made their camp in an ancient burial site.

Id: [0x001047D5]
This place is ancient, a sacred site long before the Romans or Bandits came.

Id: [0x001047D8]
Lion hair. And from the smell I'm guessing they've made this place their den.

Id: [0x001047DD]
Medjay, you retread your past.

Id: [0x001047DE]
My path is not an arrow, but a pattern inscribed upon the stars.

Id: [0x001047DF]
Very poetic.

Id: [0x001047E0]
A tool to help us understand the pain and chaos of this world.

Id: [0x001047E1]
There is too much of that. But since you have removed the demon Sefetu, life is better here. Now, the people have a chance to thrive.

Id: [0x001047E4]
Picked at by vultures. But how did he end up here, and who killed him? It was probably bandits.

Id: [0x001047E6]
They believe that if they give Asclepius these votives, he will heal them.

Id: [0x001047E9]
This is where they throw out the old pottery votives. The body parts Asclepius has cured… or not.

Id: [0x001047EA]
Thank you. It means a great deal to hear that.

Id: [0x001047EE]
May the gods watch over you, Medjay.

Id: [0x001047F0]
Harkuf is a good man. I am glad you were able to save him.

Id: [0x001047F2]
The gods do not make life easy, do they? Still, we persist.

Id: [0x001047F4]
What we have done for Sais, I sometimes dream that we could do for all of Egypt.

Id: [0x001047F5]
And your little one?

Id: [0x001047F6]
She is a treasure. She is at home, now.

Id: [0x001047F7]
Keep her safe.

Id: [0x001047FC]
This place is crawling with soldiers.

Id: [0x001047FF]
Caesar must be in the Curia, with the rest of the Senate.

Id: [0x00104804]
You should have taken your chance to drop off the map.

Id: [0x00104805]
It feels good to side with winners.

Id: [0x00104806]
We are the writers of history!

Id: [0x0010480A]
This relic should never be found again.

Id: [0x0010480E]
Aya will want to know our son's ka has been put to rest.

Id: [0x00104830]
My power, my potential, can you not feel it?

Id: [0x00104838]
Oh, thank you! I was sure I was doomed!

Id: [0x0010483D]
These jackals will continue to prey on the good people of this region.

Id: [0x0010483E]
I must deal with them.

Id: [0x00104846]
Get him!

Id: [0x0010484A]
Soldiers. Of course.

Id: [0x0010484B]
What was that!?

Id: [0x0010484D]
Crocodiles plague our village. You'll find them roaming east of here.

Id: [0x00104851]
That woman has a warrior's bearing. She could be the one spoken of in the letter.

Id: [0x00104852]
Die!

Id: [0x00104858]
This must be the "sad fishing village" the Phylakes mentioned.

Id: [0x0010485E]
The crocodiles haunt a small island east of the village.

Id: [0x00104860]
Convince me of your strength by handling our crocodile problem.

Id: [0x00104861]
I just don't give a nek anymore. Nothing will stop me.

Id: [0x00104862]
Fortifications. They are Roman.

Id: [0x00104863]
Someone must have seen the Lion pass through.

Id: [0x00104868]
The blood on your sword will be proof of your Medjay oath.

Id: [0x00104869]
Your village should be safe from crocodiles for a time.

Id: [0x0010486A]
Good.

Id: [0x0010486E]
Aya! I am wounded! You must protect the Queen!

Id: [0x0010486F]
I am coming!

Id: [0x00104870]
I got this my love.

Id: [0x0010488C]
Could that be the man the baker is looking for?

Id: [0x0010488F]
People of Memphis! Look on this wretched man and beware.

Id: [0x00104890]
If you do not pay your taxes, the price will be your life.

Id: [0x00104891]
[crying] Teta! Oh, Teta, I'm so sorry!

Id: [0x00104894]
All he needed to do was pay Pharaoh what he owed. But he refused!

Id: [0x00104899]
You dare! No, not quite. You...dare! You dare! That's it! That's it!

Id: [0x0010489A]
I call you traitor! Yes? No, not quite right. I call you traitor. I call you traitor. There. That's it.

Id: [0x0010489B]
The Republic of Shadows! Not quite. The Republic of Shadows. Definitely not. The Republic of Shadows? Yes.

Id: [0x001048B7]
Does she know you feel this way about her?

Id: [0x001048B8]
I have not yet been brave enough to confess my love for her!

Id: [0x001048B9]
Also, I am a wanted man.

Id: [0x001048BA]
It has nothing to do with taxes!

Id: [0x001048BC]
Lady Taimhotep loves our cakes and bread. For five years, we have delivered them to the Great Temple.

Id: [0x001048BD]
But yesterday, I overheard a guard say that this week's cakes had been poisoned!

Id: [0x001048BF]
We have served the temple faithfully for years. It makes me weep to think how we have been used!

Id: [0x001048C2]
Gods dammit, what's the line?

Id: [0x001048C3]
The cheerful cat choked on the cheese. The cheerful cat choked on the cheese.

Id: [0x001048C6]
At you, gall. No. At their gall! No it's at gall. At gall. Got it.

Id: [0x001048C7]
My lover of free will. What was it? Oh, love of free will, right.

Id: [0x001048C8]
Wait, I thought I was playing the Pharaoh!

Id: [0x001048C9]
Carve your eyes! Carve your eyes! Carve. Your. Eyes.

Id: [0x001048CA]
Aya must know our son's ka has been put to rest.

Id: [0x001048CB]
Flavius isn't here to save you this time Septimius. No Roman deals will be made.

Id: [0x001048CF]
Well?

Id: [0x001048D0]
Teta, I love you!

Id: [0x001048D1]
What?

Id: [0x001048D2]
And I uncovered a plot to poison the lady Taimhotep, beloved of the High Priest!

Id: [0x001048D3]
What?!

Id: [0x001048D5]
Have they been delivered?

Id: [0x001048D6]
I… I don't know. They'd be in the garrison, if not.

Id: [0x001048D7]
Then I will have to move quickly.

Id: [0x001048DC]
This… This is all too much for me.

Id: [0x001048DD]
Would you like to sit down?

Id: [0x001048DE]
No! I need to think.

Id: [0x001048DF]
A whole society! But how will you find them in all this vast land? It would be like chasing minnows down the Nile!

Id: [0x001048E0]
Of course, love.

Id: [0x001048E4]
I need to destroy those poisoned cakes before they are delivered to the temple.

Id: [0x001048E5]
Now to make sure they will not poison anyone.

Id: [0x001048E8]
You have the list? The names of the shrouded ones in Cyrenaica?

Id: [0x001048E9]
Yes, you and another of Apollodorus' agents survived. I freed him from the barracks in Balagrae.

Id: [0x001048EA]
You have done Egypt and Apollodorus a great service, Medjay. Amun Ra reward you.

Id: [0x001048EC]
[exhale of relief] The lady Taimhotep is safe.

Id: [0x001048ED]
Happy news! May you both prosper.

Id: [0x001048EF]
Who sent you? Apollodorus? I would not have betrayed Egypt!

Id: [0x001048F0]
You serve Apollodorus?

Id: [0x001048F1]
I am part of his divine manipulation of the threads. A viper in the long grass of Cyreanica.

Id: [0x001048F2]
We are compromised. I know not how or by who, but that is how the Centurion found me. He has a list of spies.

Id: [0x001048F3]
Not all men will stand up to torture as well as you.

Id: [0x001048F4]
Find the Roman, see what information he has. He patrols the border towers.

Id: [0x001048F5]
For Egypt.

Id: [0x001048F6]
For a free Egypt.

Id: [0x001048FF]
And they say, if you whisper a prayer into a wave, or a fold of the sea, you can hear their war cry answer back. Alala, alala! And that is how it happened, to a word!

Id: [0x00104904]
Our Faiyum, our home, is now a place where there are Greek-only stalls. These neket iadet will not even serve Egyptians!

Id: [0x00104906]
Prosperity for all, they say. Well, where is it? Where are the benefits, the peace of mind? It is all with the Greeks! It is not for Egyptians! The new laws are made by Greeks for Greeks.

Id: [0x00104907]
Greeks grow fatter and richer in Egypt, while we go hungry. The poor are taxed more than the rich. Why is this happening? This is our home. Egypt belongs to us!

Id: [0x00104908]
Prosperity for all? There is no grain. They have burned our farms and driven us out. Where will we get our food? We know what Greek prosperity means! Famine for Egypt!

Id: [0x0010490C]
To ensure the safety of all in Krokodilopolis, segregation of Greek and Egyptian communities is now necessary. Everyone will benefit from the new arrangements. Security for all!

Id: [0x0010490D]
Greeks will move to the newly renovated areas in the north of the city. Egyptians will join their brethren in the south where security will be improved. Security for all!

Id: [0x0010490E]
The recent brutal murder of a Greek merchant in the slums has shown the need for greater security. Military presence will be increased. Frequent patrols of the Egyptian Quarter will ensure everyone in Krokodilopolis is protected!

Id: [0x00104914]
Why should the gods help Egyptians when we refuse to help ourselves? Nek! Even Sobek no longer protects us. His damned priests lie and steal from the people, and the gods do nothing!

Id: [0x00104916]
Hundreds of Egyptians starve every year! Where is Sobek and his sandal licking priests? Where is the protection we were promised? What is he doing? Fattening his priests with offerings stolen from the poor!

Id: [0x00104917]
The priests of Sobek hold hands with the dogs of Ptolemy! They force money from us through fear. Fear of what? A temple that no longer cares for us. A cult that grows fat while we starve!

Id: [0x00104918]
This piazza, another magnificent example of Greek architecture, stands in the very midst of the Faiyum's farmland. A generous gift from the Nomarch, it represents how close our two cultures have grown.

Id: [0x0010491D]
Greek culture is the completion of Egyptian effort. The past is gone, and the future is here. Egypt joins with Greece to produce a new and better way for everyone.

Id: [0x0010491E]
Culture for all! This message has been sponsored by Triton's Fine Greek Wine, the most luxurious wines in all Faiyum!

Id: [0x0010491F]
Prosperity for all? Pah! It is prosperity only for the rich damned Greeks and their traitorous Egyptian pets.

Id: [0x00104920]
Did you hear about Aset? Her daughter was promised in marriage, but she could not afford the wedding. Now they are both begging for food in the slums! The damned slums!

Id: [0x00104926]
Most of my grain is taken by taxes and soldiers. I barely have enough left to eat. Is this shit what they mean by prosperity?

Id: [0x00104927]
We cannot even trust the Phylakitai to help us! They eat from the corrupt Nomarch's hands! Food that belongs to our god damned families! They steal the grain from our own children's mouths!

Id: [0x00104928]
And what about Raho. His family lost their farm to Greek friends of the Nomarch. Now they are forced to work like slaves on the land they once owned! Nek!

Id: [0x00104929]
The magnificent statues of Aphrodite you see around the villa grounds hide a wonderful secret. These images of the goddess of beauty were all modelled after our honorable Lady of the Villa!

Id: [0x0010492D]
Due to the unceasing efforts of our honourable Lady, the Faiyum is prospering again. There is more grain than there has ever been. Farms are producing at record rates, filling our storehouses.

Id: [0x0010492E]
Faiyum is the happy recipient of the best in Greek culture. And it's thanks to our honourable Lady. We are all humble beneficiaries of her elegance, education, and impeccable taste. Culture for all!

Id: [0x0010492F]
The Faiyum has never been safer! The increased security is a result of our Lady's selfless generosity. She has worked tirelessly to provide a safer community for all of us.

Id: [0x00104930]
Who is there to compare to our Lady of the villa? Who has done as much for the Faiyum? It is to her we owe our allegiance and our lasting thanks! Culture for all!

Id: [0x00104933]
What's that? Who's there?

Id: [0x00104935]
Now for the rest of them.

Id: [0x00104937]
Yes, Sminthos. I hate the way he talks.

Id: [0x0010493A]
Sir Bayek! We're not done with the caper.

Id: [0x0010493D]
There you are, Sir Bayek!

Id: [0x00104940]
As I was saying…

Id: [0x0010494C]
Speaking of Medjay, any news of Aya?

Id: [0x0010494D]
Aya is still defending the seas. We are expecting Pompey and his fleet anyday now, to unite against the Order and change the land.

Id: [0x0010494E]
I did see a lot on my hunt that sickened me. Our land is being oppressed greatly. I realized we cannot let the Order rise again.

Id: [0x0010494F]
Yes Bayek, the two new names, the Jackal and the Scorpion are within my brother's inner circle.

Id: [0x00104950]
We believe they are the ones behind the attempt on my life.

Id: [0x00104952]
If I must.

Id: [0x00104953]
What does this boatman want?

Id: [0x00104954]
Medjay! Come and sit with me!

Id: [0x00104955]
Over here! I have a proposition!

Id: [0x0010495A]
You have the look of a man who's traveled far, underneath a unlucky star.

Id: [0x0010495C]
Sit down, Medjay, so we may discuss my business proposition!

Id: [0x0010495E]
Please, have a seat!

Id: [0x00104960]
Do me the courtesy of sitting!

Id: [0x00104961]
Medjay, I am talking to you!

Id: [0x00104962]
Stand guard while Pothinus pisses in alleyways. Keep a look out while Eudoros inspects naked gladiators. It never ends!

Id: [0x00104963]
On second thought, "Thutmose the Fearsome" isn't quite right. How about Thutmose the Ferocious? Better, yes?

Id: [0x00104964]
Yes, yes! You will shrug off a crocodile's jaws as most men would a gnat's.

Id: [0x00104965]
Kill crocodiles near the palace, and I will award you half my fee! What do you say, Medjay?

Id: [0x0010496A]
Nek! The Crocodile God himself would cause less chaos.

Id: [0x0010496C]
Ah! My skin! Sure an affliction. I should never have consorted with that sailor.

Id: [0x0010496E]
Where's my entertainment! Good god! Must I find everything for myself?

Id: [0x00104970]
Ptolemy. Any moments away from that petulant child are a blessing.

Id: [0x00104972]
Is someone looking at me through the lattice!

Id: [0x00104974]
That's rather exciting.

Id: [0x00104975]
Bring me my roast piglet! I love to eat in a warm bath.

Id: [0x00104976]
What did I know? I knew shit, I was an idiot. "You tell your Gennadios to shove his head in a puddle of cow shit!"

Id: [0x00104977]
I should not'a said that. That was a mistake. This wine is horrible.

Id: [0x0010497C]
I will get the ritual item first, and then hunt down the birds.

Id: [0x0010497F]
The tomb.

Id: [0x00104981]
These markings here, they speak of Siwa. The vault. And the scepter Alexander holds.

Id: [0x00104983]
Amun stands in a field of trees… a marked sphere meets its scepter. Man to King, King to God.

Id: [0x00104984]
A marked sphere? Like the one you got from Medunamun?

Id: [0x00104985]
Perhaps. That would explain his obsession.

Id: [0x00104986]
Let us open the way for the others.

Id: [0x00104988]
What did you do with the orb I gave you?

Id: [0x00104989]
I gave it to Apollodorus, he wanted it for study.

Id: [0x0010498B]
Hmm… What are these paintings?

Id: [0x0010498F]
There. This pile of dead crocodiles should be high enough to please Thutmose.

Id: [0x00104993]
One day I met an all-powerful Medjay, who kept the crocodiles away… Wait, do those rhyme?

Id: [0x00104999]
They got it right, this way is completely blocked.

Id: [0x0010499A]
That earthquake must have altered the structure. Hmm.

Id: [0x0010499B]
This pharos will only burn for Cleopatra.

Id: [0x0010499F]
Pile… crocodile… Oh no, he's rubbing off on me.

Id: [0x001049A6]
Of course I did. Yet still no Medjay to share it with. The gods have returned to our farms Bayek. Have you returned to feast with me?

Id: [0x001049AB]
This is a truly wondrous sarcophagus. A tomb fit for a god.

Id: [0x001049AC]
There must be more to this tomb than we see. We should set our soldiers to exacavate it all.

Id: [0x001049AD]
Yes my imperator. What hidden powers lay amidst this tomb, we must possess.

Id: [0x001049AE]
Yes, yes Flavius.

Id: [0x001049AF]
I do feel privileged to be near this great man. It resonates, his aura is all-consuming.

Id: [0x001049B0]
He is immortal. That is why.

Id: [0x001049B1]
What he possesses is immortal as well.

Id: [0x001049B2]
We should bring this sarcophagus to Rome!

Id: [0x001049B3]
For now I need to introduce you to some friends of mine. We have a lot to discuss.

Id: [0x001049B5]
What do you think of this Apollodorus?

Id: [0x001049B6]
The scepter has a value beyond words. I am sure of it.

Id: [0x001049B7]
The gold in the sarcophagus would normally be enough to fund a war. These are offerings we can make to court Rome even more.

Id: [0x001049B8]
Tampering with the sarcophagus of a god-king is not the most fortuitous of acts.

Id: [0x001049B9]
We are gods. It is our right to take what is ours. And it all is.

Id: [0x001049BA]
You should discuss with Caesar and Flavius. They will be wooed by riches and the glory of our great Alexandria. Bring them into the fold completely.

Id: [0x001049BC]
Aya, where are the emissaries?

Id: [0x001049BD]
I will get to it.

Id: [0x001049BE]
Haha, I'm glad I've entered your dreams. That's where I belong. Ha!

Id: [0x001049BF]
Did you ever get that feast you wanted?

Id: [0x001049C1]
I'm a strong swimmer.

Id: [0x001049C2]
Of course you are. Those arms!

Id: [0x001049C3]
Of course you will! And as your loyal companion, I will point you toward the mischief-makers.

Id: [0x001049C4]
Never mind! There is a hidden cave near the city's northern limit. Meet me there tonight.

Id: [0x001049C8]
I will put a stop to this mischief.

Id: [0x001049CB]
How are my emissaries? Any news?

Id: [0x001049CC]
No, I will get to it Lord Caesar.

Id: [0x001049CD]
The emissaries were meant to bring us an alliance with Ptolemy.

Id: [0x001049CE]
I will find them. In time.

Id: [0x001049D2]
I will meet you back at my boat!

Id: [0x001049D6]
Do Medjays ever take apprentices?

Id: [0x001049D8]
The Medjay, in vengeance and terror, chased down the vile seafarers… Hmm, that is not quite right.

Id: [0x001049D9]
When you tell tales of this grand adventure, do not forget to mention Thutmose the Bold.

Id: [0x001049DB]
As you say, my Queen.

Id: [0x001049DC]
Aya! The emissaries?

Id: [0x001049DD]
Relax Apollodorus, I am taking care of it.

Id: [0x001049E3]
I am still missing a clue, Medjay the True. Come back tonight.

Id: [0x001049E5]
Tonight, I promise to reveal all!

Id: [0x001049E8]
Hello, hello! Come back later, when the sky is dark.

Id: [0x001049EB]
One of the scum responsible for the crocodile attacks.

Id: [0x001049EC]
He has the look of a mercenary.

Id: [0x001049F0]
She is dumping body parts into the river to attract the crocodiles.

Id: [0x001049F1]
Treating the dead as trash… She deserves the same treatment.

Id: [0x001049F7]
Sobek's children will be more peaceful now.

Id: [0x001049FA]
A letter on fine papyrus.

Id: [0x00104A02]
Here is a scroll. Might be a commission.

Id: [0x00104A03]
Those who baited the crocodiles are now bait.

Id: [0x00104A04]
A thousand thanks, Medjay the Mighty!

Id: [0x00104A05]
They were hired by a whole society of evildoers. And I will hunt them down, one by one.

Id: [0x00104A07]
As I thought. They were hired by the Lizard to carry out this atrocity.

Id: [0x00104A08]
May the Order and its drudges rot in a pit of sand.

Id: [0x00104A0C]
Someday, everyone in Egypt will speak of you.

Id: [0x00104A0E]
If ever you change your mind and seek a traveling companion, think of Thutmose the Faithful!

Id: [0x00104A15]
The regime presses even a poor baker so hard? Helping her would be a strike against Ptolemy, however small.

Id: [0x00104A16]
I'll tell you everything when we get back to Teta.

Id: [0x00104A19]
Teta, beautiful Teta… Her face is like the sun!

Id: [0x00104A1B]
Teta, my love, I am coming to you!

Id: [0x00104A1D]
Hurry! Not much further until I can see my love again!

Id: [0x00104A1F]
This man is heavy. Too good at his job, I suppose.

Id: [0x00104A20]
Teta!

Id: [0x00104A22]
What?

Id: [0x00104A27]
I am so glad I got the chance to explain what really happened!

Id: [0x00104A29]
It feels good to have finally confessed my love.

Id: [0x00104A2D]
I do not know what to make of all this.

Id: [0x00104A2F]
Ahmes the fruit-seller must have something to do with the plot against me.

Id: [0x00104A31]
How long has Sasobek been in love with me?

Id: [0x00104A32]
Another basket of cakes. These need to be destroyed too.

Id: [0x00104A33]
I should check to see if there are any others.

Id: [0x00104A35]
More cakes! How many does one person need?

Id: [0x00104A39]
That is the last of the cakes. Taimhotep is safe now.

Id: [0x00104A3A]
And what about you?

Id: [0x00104A3B]
We will go to the High Priest and tell him of this plot.

Id: [0x00104A3C]
He is a kind man. He will understand we meant his wife no harm.

Id: [0x00104A3D]
In the Season of Flooding, we will be married!

Id: [0x00104A41]
How funny… I would never have known of Sasobek's love for me if he had not been arrested!

Id: [0x00104A43]
I still think Ahmes the fruit-seller is to blame somehow. May his liver putrefy.

Id: [0x00104A45]
My first husband died long ago. I did not think I would marry again.

Id: [0x00104A4D]
Fear of death gave me the courage to confess my love.

Id: [0x00104A4F]
I am the happiest man alive!

Id: [0x00104A51]
I will love Teta even after our journey to the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00104A53]
The new Greek Quarter is not just a handsome addition to our city. It promises substantial increase in trade for all in Krokodilopolis. Greek and Egyptian alike will benefit through greater profits. Prosperity for all!

Id: [0x00104A5B]
The Greeks have joined us in worship of Serapis. Now they have joined us as citizens of Krokodilopolis. Hand in hand we are building a prosperous future. Greek and Egyptian, together united. Prosperity for all!

Id: [0x00104A5C]
Is it not clear that Sobek himself favours Krokodilopolis? Even Greece has come to our city to enjoy his protection. Let us honour the god with offerings freely and generously given.

Id: [0x00104A5D]
Krokodilopolis' new entertainment district is now open! A triumph of Greek construction, it offers culture and recreation to all. Once security concerns are addressed, Egyptians too will enjoy its benefits!

Id: [0x00104A5E]
Those among you who want to experience the new entertainment district can! Following payment of a monthly cultural tax, Egyptians will also be admitted. Culture for all!

Id: [0x00104A5F]
Culture for all! This message is brought to you by Alexio's Fine Meats. Alexio has the best meats in Krokodilopolis, brought directly from Athens to you.

Id: [0x00104A65]
They are far more aggressive than usual.

Id: [0x00104A68]
Goods of the Gods!

Id: [0x00104A69]
Weapons and tools blessed by pharaohs of the old kingdom!

Id: [0x00104A6A]
My camel is full of great treasure from across the lands!

Id: [0x00104A72]
I will see what you have.

Id: [0x00104A73]
Come! Look around. If you want, good neb, I have other jobs too.

Id: [0x00104A75]
[crying] Teta! My love!

Id: [0x00104A77]
[crying]

Id: [0x00104A79]
Teta, this is not what you think!

Id: [0x00104A7A]
The Medjay has returned! In need of more finery?

Id: [0x00104A7C]
Bayek! Have my goods brought you many victories?

Id: [0x00104A88]
Your brothers are dead. They had orders to execute me.

Id: [0x00104A8A]
These are the times we live in.

Id: [0x00104A8E]
You know, I always admired the Medjay. I wish I could have been one of you.

Id: [0x00104A8F]
There are so few of us left.

Id: [0x00104A90]
The Phylakes were always short on honor.

Id: [0x00104A92]
She is her own woman.

Id: [0x00104A93]
And her bread smells delicious.

Id: [0x00104A95]
Really?

Id: [0x00104A96]
My strength comes from the beautiful Teta!

Id: [0x00104A97]
Hush!

Id: [0x00104A98]
They're running!

Id: [0x00104A99]
I would not call it easy.

Id: [0x00104AAC]
Rabiah, we will come back to you when we can.

Id: [0x00104AAE]
Careful. We don't know what's in there.

Id: [0x00104AAF]
We must find out what happened.

Id: [0x00104AB2]
Scraps of a message. There's too much missing.

Id: [0x00104AB4]
Troubling. This reminds me of a sign of Serqet I've already seen. Many of the clues are eroded, but this death was violent, purposeful, and obscene.

Id: [0x00104AB8]
Oh, my aching head!

Id: [0x00104ABA]
I was so looking forward to surprising Mother with my new bride.

Id: [0x00104ABC]
I will never drink again!

Id: [0x00104AC1]
The crocodiles are dead. Now to speak to Klaudios and find out why he came out here.

Id: [0x00104AC5]
Bayek! Is that you?

Id: [0x00104AC6]
It is an ambush!

Id: [0x00104AC7]
You are telling me!

Id: [0x00104AC9]
Hepzefa! Watch out!

Id: [0x00104ACA]
Bayek, my friend. You haven't lost it. (Laughs)

Id: [0x00104ACB]
You are a step slower, seni.

Id: [0x00104AD0]
Praise and thanks! You saved my life… and my purse.

Id: [0x00104AD1]
In future, be careful when drinking with strangers.

Id: [0x00104ADE]
It was Flavius all along.

Id: [0x00104ADF]
We trusted him. We were fools.

Id: [0x00104AE1]
He brought Caesar and the Romans here, hoping to take complete power.

Id: [0x00104AEA]
You have?

Id: [0x00104AEB]
There are some who will be unhappy to learn of this. I hope you are fleet of foot, Medjay.

Id: [0x00104AF0]
My friend! I am glad to see you have kept our appointment.

Id: [0x00104AF1]
Come, sit with me and share a drink of wine.

Id: [0x00104AF2]
You will be glad to know I've destroyed the camp where the false idols were made.

Id: [0x00104AF8]
So you were in league with the bandits, eh?

Id: [0x00104AF9]
Well, that is not precisely how I would describe it…

Id: [0x00104AFA]
Get out of here before I kill you too.

Id: [0x00104AFD]
A man who fights as well as you can perhaps afford to be trusting.

Id: [0x00104AFE]
A statue of Ptolemy? The false pharaoh.

Id: [0x00104AFF]
You cursed King. Just a boy. Whoever put you here should die.

Id: [0x00104B01]
This was not here when I left.

Id: [0x00104B03]
More statues of Ptolemy. Propaganda spreads fast under Ptolemy.

Id: [0x00104B04]
Again the false pharaoh.

Id: [0x00104B06]
For Egypt!

Id: [0x00104B07]
For a true Egypt!

Id: [0x00104B08]
You will not take our freedom!

Id: [0x00104B09]
For freedom!

Id: [0x00104B0A]
Egypt needs a new pharaoh.

Id: [0x00104B0B]
The world is a better place without such false idols.

Id: [0x00104B0C]
I cannot look at you without thinking of the darkness that has enveloped my life.

Id: [0x00104B0D]
Ptolemy. You represent everything I hate in the world.

Id: [0x00104B0F]
Back for more goods, Medjay! Great!

Id: [0x00104B10]
The Medjay! Bayek of Siwa, your legacy grows!

Id: [0x00104B16]
A scene of death. I should investigate.

Id: [0x00104B18]
Indications of violence and bloodshed. I should investigate.

Id: [0x00104B1B]
What happened here? Omens of death.

Id: [0x00104B21]
Serapis, god of divine majesty and lord of the sun, someone has placed a mark upon you. The scorpion is the sign of Serqet.

Id: [0x00104B22]
Good hunting, Medjay!

Id: [0x00104B23]
I'm afraid there won't be any of us left to show defiance at this rate.

Id: [0x00104B24]
It does not matter how many the Ptolemies send to hunt us down. We will win. Somehow.

Id: [0x00104B25]
Sit and rest your feet a moment!

Id: [0x00104B2D]
I am more worried that the pharaoh's killers might have caught them.

Id: [0x00104B30]
These deaths seem like some kind of perverse ritual against the gods. Who, or what, is driving it?

Id: [0x00104B35]
Dark and foreboding invocations.

Id: [0x00104B38]
These deaths are a harrowing journey into madness. What could the perpetrators hope to gain by invoking the goddess of magic?

Id: [0x00104B39]
Here is half my pay, as promised.

Id: [0x00104B3F]
But where is the body?

Id: [0x00104B44]
This perverse poetry celebrates chaos. It inverts all that is divine and just.

Id: [0x00104B47]
Curious, sinister writings.

Id: [0x00104B4B]
Kill them all!

Id: [0x00104B4D]
Death to the Pharaoh's men!

Id: [0x00104BBA]
Come, we must make haste!

Id: [0x00104BBB]
Follow me!

Id: [0x00104BBC]
This way!

Id: [0x00104BBD]
Let's go!

Id: [0x00104BCB]
Not so fast!

Id: [0x00104BCC]
Wait for me.

Id: [0x00104BCD]
Right, onwards.

Id: [0x00104BCE]
Good. Now, this way.

Id: [0x00104BCF]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104BD0]
What? Did you see something?

Id: [0x00104BD1]
That was close. So...

Id: [0x00104BD2]
A few flesh wounds. Now, then...

Id: [0x00104BD3]
Uh, where were we?

Id: [0x00104BD4]
As I was saying...

Id: [0x00104BE7]
I have things to do.

Id: [0x00104BE8]
Come, now.

Id: [0x00104BE9]
This requires your attention.

Id: [0x00104BEA]
Today, Bayek. Not tomorrow.

Id: [0x00104BF8]
You can not hear me over there.

Id: [0x00104BF9]
Walk with me, not alone.

Id: [0x00104BFA]
Good. This way.

Id: [0x00104BFB]
That is better.

Id: [0x00104BFC]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104BFD]
Is there something over there?

Id: [0x00104C00]
Oh, what is it I was saying?

Id: [0x00104C01]
Hmm... Let us continue.

Id: [0x00104C0E]
Something of importance was here.

Id: [0x00104C15]
Come along!

Id: [0x00104C16]
We must hurry!

Id: [0x00104C17]
Over this way.

Id: [0x00104C18]
Follow me, and stay close.

Id: [0x00104C19]
To horse friend!

Id: [0x00104C1A]
Get to your horse!

Id: [0x00104C1B]
Climb on!

Id: [0x00104C1C]
Mount up!

Id: [0x00104C1D]
They'll attack us on sight!

Id: [0x00104C1E]
Be prepared.

Id: [0x00104C1F]
Careful here.

Id: [0x00104C20]
Hands on your hilts.

Id: [0x00104C21]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104C22]
Psst! Why are you over there?

Id: [0x00104C23]
Psst! Let us hurry!

Id: [0x00104C24]
Psst! Let's go.

Id: [0x00104C25]
Psst! Let's move quickly.

Id: [0x00104C26]
Wait for me, will you?

Id: [0x00104C27]
Slow down.

Id: [0x00104C28]
Onwards, then.

Id: [0x00104C29]
Good. Now, follow me.

Id: [0x00104C2A]
What are you doing over there?

Id: [0x00104C2B]
No, no! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104C2C]
No time to waste.

Id: [0x00104C2D]
Now that that's taken care of...

Id: [0x00104C2E]
Where were we?

Id: [0x00104C2F]
Allow me to continue.

Id: [0x00104C30]
Come, we must make haste!

Id: [0x00104C31]
No time to tarry!

Id: [0x00104C32]
Come, come, no time to waste!

Id: [0x00104C33]
Stay the course!

Id: [0x00104C38]
Ah, a forbidden area!

Id: [0x00104C39]
Ah, a forbidden area! Fascinating.

Id: [0x00104C3A]
There's peril there!

Id: [0x00104C3B]
This could get tricky!

Id: [0x00104C3C]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104C3D]
Psst! Did you see something?

Id: [0x00104C3E]
Psst! Let us hurry!

Id: [0x00104C3F]
Psst! We need to be quick!

Id: [0x00104C40]
Psst! Quick, quick!

Id: [0x00104C41]
Uh, not so fast!

Id: [0x00104C42]
Uh, hold a little!

Id: [0x00104C43]
Forward.

Id: [0x00104C44]
Right, onwards.

Id: [0x00104C45]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104C46]
Don't abandon me now!

Id: [0x00104C47]
Whew! Ah, uh... where were we?

Id: [0x00104C48]
Whew! Ah, uh... what was I saying?

Id: [0x00104C49]
Uh, where were we?

Id: [0x00104C4A]
Uh, what was that?

Id: [0x00104CAE]
You move like a tortoise.

Id: [0x00104CAF]
Let us get going, old friend.

Id: [0x00104CB0]
Bayek! Let's move!

Id: [0x00104CB1]
No sense staying here. Let us go!

Id: [0x00104CB2]
Mount up!

Id: [0x00104CB3]
Grab that horse.

Id: [0x00104CB4]
Climb on!

Id: [0x00104CB6]
Careful up here!

Id: [0x00104CB7]
Soldiers!

Id: [0x00104CB8]
Watch out!

Id: [0x00104CB9]
Bayek! Careful!

Id: [0x00104CBA]
Bayek! I'm over here.

Id: [0x00104CBC]
Come on!

Id: [0x00104CBD]
Bayek!

Id: [0x00104CBF]
Bayek! Hold up.

Id: [0x00104CC0]
Wait for me!

Id: [0x00104CC1]
Good. Come on.

Id: [0x00104CC2]
Ready?

Id: [0x00104CC3]
Bayek! Over here!

Id: [0x00104CC4]
Here I am, Bayek!

Id: [0x00104CC5]
Patrols everywhere. ... What was I saying?

Id: [0x00104CC6]
You haven't changed, Bayek. What were we talking about?

Id: [0x00104CC7]
I was just about to tell you something.

Id: [0x00104CC8]
Anyway ...

Id: [0x00104CD1]
Ahh, you would not want that, Medjay! My dear mother poisoned my father in a fit of passion!

Id: [0x00104CD4]
Bayek of Siwa, what are you of now? Haha!

Id: [0x00104CD5]
I wonder myself. Recently I fought a giant snake, the size of the pyramids, with my bare hands.

Id: [0x00104CD8]
You see my seni, it is best to tell the story, not the truth. Hahahaa! You know I have heard stories of you in my travels. You should be proud of your ways. The gods smile on your deeds.

Id: [0x00104CD9]
I love all those I meet, families, outcasts, lost gods and goddesses, desert rats, ruffians, and I will mourn the day when I cannot defend them anymore. I always wanted joy, but I worry my marriage to darkness will win.

Id: [0x00104CDA]
Your sojourn on earth should not trouble you. The joy in your heart forever walks beside you.

Id: [0x00104CDB]
Your place in The Field of Reeds will be splendid Reda.

Id: [0x00104CDC]
You are a fine storyteller seni. Though I cannot tell if you are playing a game with me or telling a story.

Id: [0x00104CDD]
They are one and the same my friend! Married to each other like the oceans and the rain.

Id: [0x00104CDE]
Alala!

Id: [0x00104CDF]
You see it now! Hahaha!

Id: [0x00104CE2]
A horrendous fate. Trapped in the shimmering sand. Your mind and body pounded by the remorseless sun.

Id: [0x00104CE3]
Waiting for the final release into the Duat.

Id: [0x00104CEE]
It is over. For now.

Id: [0x00104CF3]
Father, what have you done this time?

Id: [0x00104CF6]
He was searching for the Scarab. I hope he can help me. And, in return, I can protect your family.

Id: [0x00104CF7]
The Scarab is nonsense. Everyone knows this.

Id: [0x00104CFA]
[strangled sounds]

Id: [0x00104CFB]
He wants you to read them.

Id: [0x00104CFC]
By the gods! That is where my husband is.

Id: [0x00104CFD]
The city swallowed by the desert?

Id: [0x00104CFE]
It is Father's destiny to rebuild it! We're going to join him soon. Right, Mother?

Id: [0x00104CFF]
Yes. My husband Taharqa has been slaving there for months. I am sure he can help you. He knows everyone there.

Id: [0x00104D01]
If you go, tell him I can't wait to see him!

Id: [0x00104EA3]
Banged up, bruised and thirsty. The soldiers did not take kindly to him. But he will be all right.

Id: [0x00104EA5]
Where is your father, Kawab? We must speak of this.

Id: [0x00104EA6]
Father is away, on his great work.

Id: [0x00104EA7]
Mother! Grandfather is hurt! Soldiers mistook him for a beggar again!

Id: [0x00104EAE]
It looks like the Scarab is summoning warriors to the city of Letopolis.

Id: [0x00104EAF]
Of course I will, Kawab.

Id: [0x00104EB0]
Grandfather!

Id: [0x00104EB2]
Are you all right? Is he hurt?

Id: [0x00104ED8]
And how are we doing that?

Id: [0x00104EE1]
Do not let him escape!

Id: [0x00104EE2]
Try to cut him off!

Id: [0x00104EE3]
Give us the relic and we will not spill your blood!

Id: [0x00104EE7]
They camp in the cliffs to the west of Memphis. You can find them by following the stream.

Id: [0x00104EE8]
I will take a look. How many bandits were there?

Id: [0x00104EEE]
Also, you'll need to find a way into the Shining Pyramid, to get the last artifact. I think there's an opening high up, but it's quite the climb.

Id: [0x00104EEF]
In my youth I could have done it, but…

Id: [0x00104EF6]
I'll head back to camp to try to unravel the mystery.

Id: [0x00104EF8]
The priceless treasures of Sneferu have been lost to the ages. We will be heroes when we recover them and bring them out into the light of day.

Id: [0x00104EF9]
I'm no grave robber.

Id: [0x00104EFA]
No, no, no, of course not. I promise you this will not disturb anyone's rest in the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00104EFB]
The top of the Tomb of Sneferu. There are strange slots here.

Id: [0x00104F01]
Here we are! The entrance will be hidden, of course.

Id: [0x00104F0C]
Let us make haste!

Id: [0x00104F0D]
Greater speed is needed!

Id: [0x00104F0E]
We must hurry our steps!

Id: [0x00104F0F]
There is no time!

Id: [0x00104F10]
Will you mount?

Id: [0x00104F11]
Let us proceed on horseback!

Id: [0x00104F12]
Join me here!

Id: [0x00104F13]
Climb on!

Id: [0x00104F14]
This area is forbidden.

Id: [0x00104F15]
Dangers are near!

Id: [0x00104F16]
There's peril nearby!

Id: [0x00104F17]
I fear for our safety!

Id: [0x00104F18]
We must stay close!

Id: [0x00104F19]
Why do you stray?

Id: [0x00104F1A]
Let us move forward with care.

Id: [0x00104F1B]
We must be both fleet and silent!

Id: [0x00104F1C]
Forward, quickly and quietly!

Id: [0x00104F1D]
Please, slow your steps!

Id: [0x00104F1E]
I cannot keep up with you!

Id: [0x00104F1F]
Let us go on.

Id: [0x00104F20]
Shall we proceed?

Id: [0x00104F21]
Stay close, please!

Id: [0x00104F22]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00104F23]
Now, let me settle my mind…

Id: [0x00104F24]
By the gods! Now, to return to what we spoke of…

Id: [0x00104F25]
Where had we left off?

Id: [0x00104F26]
What were we speaking of?

Id: [0x00104F2A]
A perfectly preserved pyramidion. A relic of the gods, and the origin of all good things.

Id: [0x00104F2D]
Once I've catalogued what we've discovered, I'll cart it back to the Library of Alexandria so it can be studied and preserved for the ages.

Id: [0x00104F2F]
The desert is meant for old souls. Hunters, and poets. Not the slaughter of innocents.

Id: [0x00104F30]
You know this place well?

Id: [0x00104F31]
I grew up here. I love it. But the Pharaoh's men spoil everything they touch.

Id: [0x00104F33]
The children used to run free, here. But ever since the Pharaoh's guards arrived...

Id: [0x00104F34]
What was once a playground is now a death ground.

Id: [0x00104F35]
Yes. The Pharaoh's men are snakes, coiled in the sand beneath our feet. They kill adults and children alike.

Id: [0x00104F9C]
May our steps be fleet!

Id: [0x00104F9D]
The four winds lend us speed!

Id: [0x00104F9E]
The gods wait for no man!

Id: [0x00104F9F]
Hurry -- the moment is now!

Id: [0x00104FA1]
To horse my friend!

Id: [0x00104FA2]
Climb aboard!

Id: [0x00104FA3]
Come, join me!

Id: [0x00104FA4]
This place is forbidden to us.

Id: [0x00104FA5]
Danger threatens!

Id: [0x00104FA6]
I sense danger nearby!

Id: [0x00104FA7]
The god sends a warning!

Id: [0x00104FA8]
The roads lead you back to me!

Id: [0x00104FA9]
Do not go too far!

Id: [0x00104FAA]
We must stay silent as the Hidden One!

Id: [0x00104FAB]
The peace of the tomb be with us!

Id: [0x00104FAC]
Let us proceed in secrecy!

Id: [0x00104FAD]
The god gentle your step!

Id: [0x00104FAE]
Slowly, Deliverer, slowly!

Id: [0x00104FAF]
Onwards, Deliverer!

Id: [0x00104FB0]
Forward into the light!

Id: [0x00104FB1]
You go too far!

Id: [0x00104FB2]
Follow more closely!

Id: [0x00104FB3]
Let us begin again.

Id: [0x00104FB4]
What were we speaking of?

Id: [0x00104FB5]
Let us speak again.

Id: [0x00104FB6]
The god opens our lips!

Id: [0x00104FCE]
Indeed. Sebni and one of our warriors went to search for the children, but the pharaoh's soldiers captured them.

Id: [0x00104FE1]
One more affliction for Memphis. The city withers in the darkness of a curse.

Id: [0x00104FE2]
Disease, pestilence… the poisoned stink of the air.

Id: [0x00104FE5]
The Apis Bull sickened nearly unto death.

Id: [0x00104FF3]
My wife's Seer can help. His house is to the southwest.

Id: [0x00105015]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105016]
Please come back!

Id: [0x0010501E]
Warrior! Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010501F]
Please don't leave me here!

Id: [0x00105029]
Come, hurry!

Id: [0x0010502A]
Come, we must make haste!

Id: [0x0010502B]
Move quickly!

Id: [0x0010502C]
We have to move!

Id: [0x0010502D]
Mount your steed!

Id: [0x0010502E]
Let's ride my love!

Id: [0x0010502F]
Mount!

Id: [0x00105030]
I shall take the reigns.

Id: [0x00105031]
It is forbidden for us to be here.

Id: [0x00105032]
We should be careful here.

Id: [0x00105033]
We are nearing trouble.

Id: [0x00105034]
Peril ahead!

Id: [0x00105035]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105036]
Psst! Its this way!

Id: [0x00105037]
Psst! Hurry!

Id: [0x00105038]
Psst! Let us move like Amun.

Id: [0x00105039]
We must go, now!

Id: [0x0010503A]
Not so fast Aya.

Id: [0x0010503B]
Slow down my love.

Id: [0x0010503C]
Right, onwards.

Id: [0x0010503D]
I'm with you.

Id: [0x0010503E]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010503F]
Why are you straying from me?

Id: [0x00105040]
Whew! Ah, uh... where were we?

Id: [0x00105041]
That was intense...what were we talking about before?

Id: [0x00105042]
Uh, where were we?

Id: [0x00105043]
What were we talking about?

Id: [0x00105044]
Come! We must move quickly!

Id: [0x00105045]
Make haste!

Id: [0x00105046]
Let's go.

Id: [0x00105047]
Quick!

Id: [0x00105048]
Mount your horse!

Id: [0x00105049]
Your horse! Quickly, we must move!

Id: [0x0010504A]
Get on!

Id: [0x0010504B]
Climb on!

Id: [0x0010504C]
We must be careful not to be seen.

Id: [0x0010504D]
The guards will be looking for us here.

Id: [0x0010504E]
Danger lies there.

Id: [0x0010504F]
Be cautious!

Id: [0x00105050]
You stray too far!

Id: [0x00105051]
Hey! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105052]
Psst. We must hurry.

Id: [0x00105053]
Fast and low.

Id: [0x00105054]
Let's move.

Id: [0x00105055]
Wait Bayek!

Id: [0x00105056]
Do not go so quickly!

Id: [0x00105057]
Onwards and upwards.

Id: [0x00105058]
Let's keep moving.

Id: [0x00105059]
Stay with me, Bayek!

Id: [0x0010505A]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010505B]
Right, now, what were we talking about?

Id: [0x0010505C]
Phew, we're in the clear... where were we?

Id: [0x0010505D]
Let's keep going.

Id: [0x0010505E]
Where were we Bayek?

Id: [0x00105069]
We have found the cause of his sickness. He was poisoned.

Id: [0x0010506A]
Who did this?

Id: [0x0010506B]
The Twin Priestesses.

Id: [0x0010506C]
[gasps]

Id: [0x0010506D]
Have them boiled to death inside a bronze bull.

Id: [0x0010506E]
Goddess, no!

Id: [0x0010506F]
They were coerced.

Id: [0x00105070]
Their brother was kidnapped, by a priest of Anubis with a blue scarf and a cough.

Id: [0x00105071]
Hetepi! But he is amongst my closest advisors.

Id: [0x00105072]
Those living in one's shadow are the least worthy of trust.

Id: [0x00105073]
If even Hetepi is against me…

Id: [0x00105075]
Your wife and child were threatened by him, but now they are safe. We can overcome this.

Id: [0x00105076]
The priests of Anubis will be conducting rites in the Great Temple. Look for their masks.

Id: [0x00105077]
My blade will serve as well as his.

Id: [0x00105078]
No, Aya. Let me.

Id: [0x00105079]
I care not who kills the priest. Let it be done before we head to Herakleion in the north.

Id: [0x0010507B]
Wait!

Id: [0x0010507D]
Ptah-Nun the father breathe strength into your arm.

Id: [0x0010507F]
As children will do.

Id: [0x001050A1]
Come, hurry!

Id: [0x001050A2]
Come, neb, we must hurry!

Id: [0x001050A3]
There is no time to tarry!

Id: [0x001050A4]
Come now!

Id: [0x001050A5]
Take a horse!

Id: [0x001050A6]
Get ready to ride!

Id: [0x001050A7]
Climb on!

Id: [0x001050A8]
Climb on!

Id: [0x001050A9]
This is not safe!

Id: [0x001050AA]
Not sure I like this!

Id: [0x001050AB]
Be careful!

Id: [0x001050AC]
Hapi, save us!

Id: [0x001050AD]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x001050AE]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x001050AF]
Psst! Go quickly!

Id: [0x001050B0]
Psst! We must be fast!

Id: [0x001050B1]
Psst! Now, neb!

Id: [0x001050B2]
Uh, not so fast!

Id: [0x001050B3]
Uh, hold up!

Id: [0x001050B4]
Hapi, guide us.

Id: [0x001050B5]
Let us go.

Id: [0x001050B6]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x001050B7]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x001050B8]
Whew! Ah, uh... where were we?

Id: [0x001050B9]
Whew! Ah, uh... I was saying...

Id: [0x001050BA]
Uh, hmmm?

Id: [0x001050BB]
Uh, yes, so...

Id: [0x001050BC]
Ow! My blood flows like beer!

Id: [0x001050BD]
Ow! My world is dimming!

Id: [0x001050BE]
Hapi, help!

Id: [0x001050BF]
Please, neb! Help!

Id: [0x001050C0]
By the gods! Help me!

Id: [0x001050C1]
Oh Hapi, protect me!

Id: [0x001050C2]
Help me Bayek!

Id: [0x001050C3]
I am being attacked!

Id: [0x001050C6]
Blessed Hapi save me...

Id: [0x001050C7]
Oh no, oh no...

Id: [0x001050C8]
Please do not hurt me...

Id: [0x00105120]
Come, we must hurry!

Id: [0x00105121]
Fly like the wind!

Id: [0x00105122]
Race the wind!

Id: [0x00105123]
Fly, like Senu!

Id: [0x00105128]
Be on guard.

Id: [0x00105129]
Not safe here.

Id: [0x0010512A]
Sobek keep us safe.

Id: [0x0010512B]
Tread lightly.

Id: [0x0010512C]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010512D]
Psst! What are you doing?

Id: [0x0010512E]
Quickly. Quietly.

Id: [0x0010512F]
Move like Sobek.

Id: [0x00105130]
Quick and quiet.

Id: [0x00105131]
Wait a moment.

Id: [0x00105132]
Hold on.

Id: [0x00105133]
Come.

Id: [0x00105134]
Ready.

Id: [0x00105135]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105136]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105137]
Whew! Ah... as I was saying.

Id: [0x00105138]
Whew! Ah, uh... ready?

Id: [0x00105139]
Ready now?

Id: [0x0010513A]
Ready?

Id: [0x00105189]
Come, move your ass!

Id: [0x0010518A]
No time like now!

Id: [0x0010518B]
Run, run for the gods!

Id: [0x0010518C]
I will leave you in the dust!

Id: [0x0010518D]
Up, up!

Id: [0x0010518E]
Mount up!

Id: [0x0010518F]
Climb on!

Id: [0x00105190]
Hurry up!

Id: [0x00105191]
This looks interesting.

Id: [0x00105192]
Ah, the gods test us!

Id: [0x00105193]
What is this now?

Id: [0x00105194]
By Helios' chariot!

Id: [0x00105195]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105196]
Psst! Come on!

Id: [0x00105197]
Psst! Time to move!

Id: [0x00105198]
Psst! No time to wait!

Id: [0x00105199]
Psst! Run!

Id: [0x0010519A]
You're not following me!

Id: [0x0010519B]
You don't know what you're doing!

Id: [0x0010519C]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0010519D]
Don't tarry.

Id: [0x0010519E]
Hah! Where do you think you're going?

Id: [0x0010519F]
You will get yourself lost!

Id: [0x001051A0]
Whew! Ah... where was I?

Id: [0x001051A1]
Whew! Ah, uh... yes, yes, what?

Id: [0x001051A2]
Hmm? Remind me what I was saying?

Id: [0x001051A3]
As I was saying...

Id: [0x001051EE]
Come, we must make haste!

Id: [0x001051EF]
Quick, like a [quadriga] (chariot)!

Id: [0x001051F0]
Race, as if you were Helios!

Id: [0x001051F1]
Hurry! Alala (Greek cheer)!

Id: [0x001051F2]
Mount up!

Id: [0x001051F3]
We ride!

Id: [0x001051F4]
Climb on!

Id: [0x001051F5]
Get on!

Id: [0x001051F6]
There's danger here.

Id: [0x001051F7]
Risk and reward await!

Id: [0x001051F8]
Careful!

Id: [0x001051F9]
Go cautiously. Danger ahead.

Id: [0x001051FA]
Psst! Where are you going?

Id: [0x001051FB]
Psst! Not so far!

Id: [0x001051FC]
Psst! We must hurry!

Id: [0x001051FD]
Shh! Be quick!

Id: [0x001051FE]
Psst! Don't linger!

Id: [0x001051FF]
Uh, not so fast!

Id: [0x00105200]
Let me catch up!

Id: [0x00105201]
Right, onwards.

Id: [0x00105202]
Right, for Prasina.

Id: [0x00105203]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105204]
You're straying too far.

Id: [0x00105205]
Whew! Ah, uh... where were we?

Id: [0x00105206]
Whew! Ah, uh... what was I saying?

Id: [0x00105207]
Uh, where were we?

Id: [0x00105208]
Hmm? What? Oh, yes...

Id: [0x00105209]
Come, we must hurry!

Id: [0x0010520A]
Hurry!

Id: [0x0010520B]
We must go fast!

Id: [0x0010520C]
Gods give us speed!

Id: [0x00105211]
Danger ahead!

Id: [0x00105212]
Careful through here!

Id: [0x00105213]
There's danger!

Id: [0x00105214]
It is perilous ahead!

Id: [0x00105215]
Psst! Come back!

Id: [0x00105216]
Psst! This way!

Id: [0x00105217]
Psst! Let us hurry!

Id: [0x00105218]
Psst! Let's hurry!

Id: [0x00105219]
Psst! Come quick!

Id: [0x0010521A]
Not so fast!

Id: [0x0010521B]
Slow a bit!

Id: [0x0010521C]
I'm ready.

Id: [0x0010521D]
Let's go.

Id: [0x0010521E]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010521F]
Where are you going, neb?

Id: [0x00105220]
Whew! Ah, uh... where were we?

Id: [0x00105221]
Whew! Ah, uh... do we go on?

Id: [0x00105222]
Uh, where were we?

Id: [0x00105223]
Uh, are you ready?

Id: [0x001052E4]
We have to hurry. I'll race you!

Id: [0x001052E5]
Hurry uncle Bayek!

Id: [0x001052E6]
I can run fast. Look!

Id: [0x001052E7]
Come on slow poke!

Id: [0x001052F7]
Uncle Bayek! Lets continue.

Id: [0x001052F8]
Come on! This way.

Id: [0x001052F9]
That's the wrong way silly.

Id: [0x001052FA]
Uncle Bayek, it's this way!

Id: [0x001052FB]
Uncle Bayek, are you alright?

Id: [0x001052FC]
That was scary! I'm glad they're gone.

Id: [0x001052FD]
I was telling a story…

Id: [0x001052FE]
Uncle Bayek! Let me finish.

Id: [0x001052FF]
I am sorry, is there somewhere else you need to be? Hurry up, camel boy!

Id: [0x00105300]
Can we pick it up?

Id: [0x00105301]
I do not have the entire day.

Id: [0x00105302]
Sometime today would be good.

Id: [0x00105305]
Thank you. Can we go now?

Id: [0x00105306]
I am sorry, did I interrupt something? Can we go now?

Id: [0x00105307]
Why are you going that way?

Id: [0x00105308]
You are going the wrong way, camel jerker. It is this way.

Id: [0x0010530B]
Finally. What was I saying…

Id: [0x0010530C]
As I was saying before being interrupted…

Id: [0x00105343]
As am I -- and proud to serve the Queen.

Id: [0x00105344]
Once the sands have settled. When will that be?

Id: [0x0010535C]
[with some breathing from exertion] Whew! Ah, uh… where were we?

Id: [0x0010535D]
Thank the gods we're safe! Let's go on.

Id: [0x0010535E]
Now, where had we left off?

Id: [0x0010535F]
Remind me of what we were saying?

Id: [0x001053FE]
Hurry, Medjay!

Id: [0x001053FF]
We need to hurry.

Id: [0x00105400]
Come on Medjay. Are you this slow with everything?

Id: [0x00105401]
Let's get moving.

Id: [0x00105402]
Use your horse!

Id: [0x00105403]
Take your horse.

Id: [0x00105404]
Snuggle up! There's room for two.

Id: [0x00105405]
Up here with me.

Id: [0x00105406]
I've never been here.

Id: [0x00105407]
This is new to me. It could be romantic.

Id: [0x00105408]
There! Up ahead!

Id: [0x00105409]
Wait Medjay! There's something there.

Id: [0x0010540A]
Hey! Slow down Medjay.

Id: [0x0010540B]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0010540C]
Medjay, we have to move.

Id: [0x0010540D]
Bayek, we need to hurry.

Id: [0x0010540E]
Come on you! Move!

Id: [0x0010540F]
Too fast Medjay.

Id: [0x00105410]
What's the rush, Medjay?

Id: [0x00105411]
Let's continue.

Id: [0x00105412]
Let's keep going.

Id: [0x00105413]
Wrong way Medjay.

Id: [0x00105414]
Going somewhere without me?

Id: [0x00105415]
Ah, that was good! Where were we?

Id: [0x00105416]
Now. What were we talking about?

Id: [0x00105417]
What were we saying? That's right…

Id: [0x00105418]
I was telling you something… Oh yes.

Id: [0x0010541D]
The Medjay rides to the Citadel! Finally, a protector to defend us!

Id: [0x0010546F]
Let's go! We don't have time to waste!

Id: [0x00105470]
My father doesn't have time to waste!

Id: [0x00105471]
We must go!

Id: [0x00105472]
There isn't time for this! We have to keep going!

Id: [0x00105473]
Take your horse!

Id: [0x00105474]
Get on you horse!

Id: [0x00105475]
Climb up with me.

Id: [0x00105476]
Get on, I'll take you.

Id: [0x00105477]
I've never been here before!

Id: [0x00105478]
This is a strange place!

Id: [0x00105479]
We need to be careful here!

Id: [0x0010547A]
Careful! This could be trouble.

Id: [0x0010547B]
You're too far ahead.

Id: [0x0010547C]
We should stay together.

Id: [0x0010547D]
Please! We have to hurry!

Id: [0x0010547E]
There is no time!

Id: [0x0010547F]
Come on, we have to go!

Id: [0x00105482]
Let's keep going.

Id: [0x00105483]
We have to go.

Id: [0x00105484]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105485]
You're too far away.

Id: [0x00105486]
Whew! Ah, uh... what were we saying?

Id: [0x00105487]
Okay, where were we?

Id: [0x00105488]
Sorry, where were we?

Id: [0x00105489]
What were we saying?

Id: [0x001054D8]
There is a time to be patient. It is not now.

Id: [0x001054D9]
We are both getting old here. We must go.

Id: [0x001054DA]
In the arena, if you hesitate you lose. It is no different out here.

Id: [0x001054DB]
Hurry son. We have to go.

Id: [0x001054E0]
There is always something new for Hilarus to see.

Id: [0x001054E1]
Something new!

Id: [0x001054E2]
I am not saying we should stop. But that looks like trouble.

Id: [0x001054E3]
Hmm. That looks like trouble.

Id: [0x001054E9]
Slow down! Not so fast!

Id: [0x001054EA]
Do not be so eager. Have patience. Let your teacher catch up.

Id: [0x001054EB]
A student never keeps his teacher waiting. We go.

Id: [0x001054EC]
It is time we continued.

Id: [0x001054ED]
That is not the way. Stay close to me.

Id: [0x001054EE]
You need to stay close to your teacher.

Id: [0x001054EF]
Ah, it gets the blood pumping! What was Hilarus saying…

Id: [0x001054F0]
Now, where was I…?

Id: [0x001054F1]
What was I saying?

Id: [0x001054F2]
I am sure I was saying something…

Id: [0x001054F5]
I think we should hurry.

Id: [0x001054F6]
We need to hurry.

Id: [0x001054F7]
Bayek, we must go.

Id: [0x001054F8]
Let's go.

Id: [0x001054F9]
You should take your horse

Id: [0x001054FA]
Use your horse.

Id: [0x001054FB]
Climb up with me.

Id: [0x001054FC]
Here, with me.

Id: [0x001054FD]
I've never seen this before. Be cautious.

Id: [0x001054FE]
This is new to me.

Id: [0x001054FF]
There! They're coming.

Id: [0x00105500]
Trouble heading this way.

Id: [0x00105508]
Should we continue?

Id: [0x00105509]
Let's go.

Id: [0x0010550A]
Is that the right way?

Id: [0x0010550B]
Bayek, come back.

Id: [0x0010550C]
Whew, that's over. What were we talking about?

Id: [0x0010550D]
Well fought. What were we saying?

Id: [0x00105514]
Thank the gods you were here! What was I saying?

Id: [0x00105515]
Is it over? Now, where were we…

Id: [0x00105516]
As I was saying…

Id: [0x00105517]
I was telling you something…

Id: [0x00105518]
Let's go, Medjay.

Id: [0x00105519]
Hey, you coming?

Id: [0x0010551A]
We should get going, it's getting late.

Id: [0x0010551B]
We should hurry, Medjay.

Id: [0x0010551C]
You should take the horse.

Id: [0x0010551D]
Why don't you use the horse?

Id: [0x0010551E]
Climb on with me!

Id: [0x0010551F]
Here! Get on!

Id: [0x00105520]
What is this?

Id: [0x00105521]
What is this place?

Id: [0x00105522]
Bayek! Up ahead!

Id: [0x00105523]
Wait! Something's up there!

Id: [0x00105529]
Bayek! Wait. My legs aren't as long as yours.

Id: [0x0010552A]
Bayek, wait for me!

Id: [0x0010552B]
This way.

Id: [0x0010552C]
We can keep going.

Id: [0x0010552D]
Hey! Wait for me!

Id: [0x0010552E]
Bayek, slow down! You'll leave me behind!

Id: [0x0010552F]
Thank the gods! I was telling you something…

Id: [0x00105530]
That was terrifying! Now what was I saying?

Id: [0x00105531]
I was saying something…

Id: [0x00105532]
What was I saying? That's right…

Id: [0x00105533]
Bayek! They're on me! Help!

Id: [0x00105534]
Ah! Help me!

Id: [0x00105535]
Got trouble here! Gimme a hand!

Id: [0x00105536]
Bayek! Help!

Id: [0x00105537]
Help me!

Id: [0x0010553C]
I don't want to die!

Id: [0x0010553D]
This isn't what I want. Help!

Id: [0x0010553E]
Please help!

Id: [0x0010553F]
Leave me! Leave me!

Id: [0x00105540]
It's this way.

Id: [0x00105541]
We should move. This way.

Id: [0x00105542]
Come. It's this way.

Id: [0x00105543]
I need to return soon. We should hurry.

Id: [0x00105544]
You should use your horse.

Id: [0x00105545]
If we ride it will be faster.

Id: [0x00105546]
Climb on with me!

Id: [0x00105547]
Come up here!

Id: [0x00105548]
This is new to me.

Id: [0x00105549]
I've never been here before.

Id: [0x0010554A]
Careful! This looks like trouble!

Id: [0x0010554B]
That doesn't look good!

Id: [0x00105551]
Wait for me!

Id: [0x00105552]
Not so fast please!

Id: [0x00105553]
I thought I'd lost you.

Id: [0x00105554]
Let's go. This way.

Id: [0x00105555]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x00105556]
You're heading in the wrong direction.

Id: [0x00105557]
You're quite a fighter! I was saying…

Id: [0x00105558]
All this fighting! As I was saying…

Id: [0x00105559]
As I was saying…

Id: [0x0010555A]
Now what was I saying? Oh yes.

Id: [0x00105567]
Come on Mr. turtle.

Id: [0x00105568]
Why you slow!

Id: [0x00105569]
You so slow!

Id: [0x0010556A]
Hurry slow legs!

Id: [0x0010556F]
Not been here!

Id: [0x00105570]
Oh! What this?

Id: [0x00105571]
Watch out!

Id: [0x00105572]
Hey! What that?!

Id: [0x0010557A]
We go now.

Id: [0x0010557B]
You back now, or go again?

Id: [0x0010557C]
That's not way!

Id: [0x0010557D]
Where going Mr Medjay?

Id: [0x0010557E]
Wow, you can fight huh?

Id: [0x0010557F]
That was bad! Not nice!

Id: [0x00105580]
I did not finish!

Id: [0x00105581]
You listening now?

Id: [0x001055CF]
Bayek, we must hurry!

Id: [0x001055D0]
We need to move quickly.

Id: [0x001055D1]
We should move.

Id: [0x001055D2]
We have got somewhere to be.

Id: [0x001055D3]
Take your horse.

Id: [0x001055D4]
You will be faster on your horse.

Id: [0x001055D5]
Mount up with me.

Id: [0x001055D6]
I'll take us both.

Id: [0x001055D7]
I have never seen this!

Id: [0x001055D8]
This is new. I forgot how good it was to explore!

Id: [0x001055D9]
Careful. There is trouble.

Id: [0x001055DA]
There is something up there.

Id: [0x001055DB]
Back this way.

Id: [0x001055DC]
That is not the way.

Id: [0x001055DD]
We should hurry.

Id: [0x001055DE]
Let us not waste time.

Id: [0x001055DF]
We should move more quickly.

Id: [0x001055E2]
Let us continue.

Id: [0x001055E3]
Let's go.

Id: [0x001055E4]
I do not think that is the right way.

Id: [0x001055E5]
Let us stay on track.

Id: [0x001055E6]
Well that was troublesome. Where were we…?

Id: [0x001055E7]
That was exhilarating. Now what was I saying?

Id: [0x001055E8]
I was telling you something. Oh yes…

Id: [0x001055E9]
Sorry, what was I saying?

Id: [0x001055EA]
Bayek, we should hurry.

Id: [0x001055EB]
We have to keep moving.

Id: [0x001055EC]
We shouldn't waste time.

Id: [0x001055ED]
Come, Medjay, we have to move.

Id: [0x001055EE]
Take your horse.

Id: [0x001055EF]
Mount up and ride.

Id: [0x001055F0]
Ride with me.

Id: [0x001055F1]
Mount up.

Id: [0x001055F2]
Strange, I've never seen this before.

Id: [0x001055F3]
I didn't know this was here.

Id: [0x001055F4]
Be careful!

Id: [0x001055F5]
That looks like trouble.

Id: [0x001055FD]
Let us go.

Id: [0x001055FE]
Good.

Id: [0x001055FF]
Bayek, that's not the right way.

Id: [0x00105600]
This way.

Id: [0x00105601]
Well, that's dealt with. What was I saying?

Id: [0x00105602]
That was… unnecessary. I was saying…

Id: [0x00105603]
What was I saying?

Id: [0x00105604]
I was saying something… oh yes.

Id: [0x00105611]
Medjay, we should hurry.

Id: [0x00105612]
There is not time to waste.

Id: [0x00105613]
We should move.

Id: [0x00105614]
Less idleness, more haste.

Id: [0x00105619]
We cannot be seen here.

Id: [0x0010561A]
This place is heavily guarded.

Id: [0x0010561B]
Be careful! There's trouble ahead.

Id: [0x0010561C]
Look! There!

Id: [0x00105622]
Slow down a bit.

Id: [0x00105623]
Let me catch up!

Id: [0x00105624]
Right, let us continue.

Id: [0x00105625]
Let us go.

Id: [0x00105626]
We should move in this direction.

Id: [0x00105627]
That is not the right way, Medjay.

Id: [0x00105628]
That ended well. What were we saying?

Id: [0x00105629]
A good fight. Now, what was I saying?

Id: [0x0010562A]
We were saying something…

Id: [0x0010562B]
Where were we? That's right…

Id: [0x00105643]
I am Nawa, and the rebel cause needs your strength.

Id: [0x00105699]
Do you train all the children to become rebels?

Id: [0x0010569A]
They are free to choose as they please. But they all hate the Pharaoh's men. (laughs)

Id: [0x0010569B]
I will go look for the little warrior.

Id: [0x0010569D]
Mmm.

Id: [0x001056A0]
And the inscriptions on this artifact must mean the pyramidion on top of Sneferu's tomb, the Shining Pyramid. I'm sure the key to the mystery is up there. Why don't you just run up and take a look?

Id: [0x001056A2]
Don't keep me in suspense. Did you find anything?

Id: [0x001056A7]
The first rays of Ra would fall upon it, and light the way for the Bennu bird, who flew over the waters of Nun.

Id: [0x001067D8]
You have done your work, Medjay. Leave us be!

Id: [0x001067E1]
You mad ruffian, I love your stories no matter their truth! It is good to see you again Reda.

Id: [0x001067E2]
Really? That is impossible! Where was this snake!??!

Id: [0x001067E3]
It is but a story. Or a dream. I do not know the difference anymore.

Id: [0x001067E9]
So many lost wonders contained within…

Id: [0x001067EB]
No.

Id: [0x001068CA]
[Sobs.]

Id: [0x001068F6]
If they catch us, who knows what will be lost? And they will probably eat you!

Id: [0x001068FA]
Oh, well, look at that!

Id: [0x001068FB]
Is that a Medjay badge? Fascinating. I thought they were all extinct. As skilled as I'd read.

Id: [0x00106916]
Cloth. From a child's...

Id: [0x00106918]
Time to find Merkes, and see what these three artifacts add up to.

Id: [0x0010697E]
Right, onwards.

Id: [0x0010697F]
Right, let us go.

Id: [0x00106982]
Whew! Ah, uh... where were we?

Id: [0x00106983]
Whew! Ah, uh... You were saying?

Id: [0x00106984]
Uh, where were we?

Id: [0x00106985]
Uh, you were saying?

Id: [0x0010698C]
Do you have both artifacts yet? I'm still trying to decode some of Manetho's writings, but I'm sure we're close!

Id: [0x0010698E]
Missing weapons! It's all anyone will talk about! But no one has found them, Bayek. Not until today... Because you will! You take whatever you need. The circle of life in the desert.

Id: [0x0010698F]
Today is the day, Bayek! I've heard of a missing convoy of weapons! You find that, and we will both be rich!

Id: [0x00106990]
Finally! You were almost too late. An informant told me of a shipment of weapons that went missing this very day. If we hurry both of us win! Go!

Id: [0x00106991]
Medjay! There's a shipment of weapons meant for those Phylakitai that has our name on it. Go and get them!

Id: [0x00106992]
Medjay, your help is needed. My customers were complaining that there were some animals stopping them from coming to me. I'm sure a warrior like you would have no trouble dealing with a few beasts.

Id: [0x00106993]
Medjay. You know the old saying "a merchant scorned by dangerous beasts has no customers at all"? No? Well, I do. I'd be thankful if you could help my customers deal with their problem.

Id: [0x00106994]
Good timing. I've been told that... hyenas? No...hippos? Ah, nek, I can't remember. Some sort of beast has been attacking a village I've taken an interest in. Should you help them, I would be well pleased.

Id: [0x00106995]
Cursed beasts take on village after village and they cry in fear. But you are not scared, are you, Medjay? Deal with these beasts, Medjay.

Id: [0x00106996]
As a child I was scared of beasts, Bayek. I do not admit that lightly. Make sure no other child knows fear as I did. Please, Bayek.

Id: [0x00106997]
These dungheaded Phylakitai! They go too far! They jailed a customer of mine, a man who only wished to protest a levy! No one will help him. But you, you are a brave Medjay. If you do what I can't, well, a good merchant keeps his customers safe.

Id: [0x00106998]
Bayek! A customer mentioned to me a friend of his who was arrested for arguing with the soldiers.  You speak of taking these men out, maybe this is an action you can do. For Egypt!

Id: [0x00106999]
These guards have no one who will stand up to them! And when they do they are jailed, no matter what they say. But you, Medjay, you can right that wrong, yes?

Id: [0x0010699A]
Sometimes, Medjay, I sell my goods to those that fight the Phylakitai. Now, well, one of my friends has been caught. Please free him.

Id: [0x0010699B]
I hate these neket iadets! These guards who steal people from their home for questioning them! Handle them, Bayek. Deal with these fools.

Id: [0x0010699C]
Tomb raiders are taking the treasures of our people, Bayek! They steal from our sacred tombs, and leave our dead destroyed. We must stop them. And by we, I mostly mean you. But I will reward you well for dealing with these heathens!

Id: [0x0010699D]
Bayek, my Medjay! There are those who defile our holiest of places, stealing our sacred treasures. These bandits only want to make coin. Stop them. Keep our lands holy, alright, seni?

Id: [0x0010699E]
Thieves! They beat me to an item that I was hoping to procure for you, Bayek. This filth must be stopped. And look at you, Bayek, a Medjay after my own heart. Help me, and you will be well rewarded.

Id: [0x0010699F]
Do you know why our people forget our history, Bayek? It's because so many of our beautiful relics are stolen! We have the power to stop them! I heard of a group of these dungeaters who are near. Handle them, and I will make sure you are well paid.

Id: [0x001069A0]
Hey seni! Come here. One of my informants told me of some tomb robbers nearby. These maggots are stealing from the gods. We must stop them.

Id: [0x001069A1]
Medjay, you seem the type of man who can track someone who has gone missing. A villager has been taken. Don't worry, I have the perfect payment in mind for you!

Id: [0x001069A2]
Medjay, you hear of that villager that went missing? I only ask because, like you, he's one of my favorite customers. Maybe you go looking for him? Maybe if you find him I'll have something nice for you. Maybe.

Id: [0x001069A3]
A friend of mine went missing. Medjay, I would not ask but he would be missed by his family. Please find where he has gone.

Id: [0x001069A4]
Come Bayek. I heard tell of a local man who went missing. Being a generous man, I would be very happy if you were to find him. For the village, of course. Not because he is one of my informants.

Id: [0x001069A5]
I will sell to you later, Medjay! A man is missing. Help him, and I will help you.

Id: [0x001069A6]
I... I do not admit this easily, Bayek. But someone attacked me and stole my wares. I know where this thief is. Help me, Bayek? Deal with this nek so he doesn't attack anyone else. You can keep whatever you find.

Id: [0x001069A7]
Medjay! A friend of mine was attacked in the desert for her goods. The thief ran off, but I know where he is. Deal with him, eh? You get whatever that fool has on him.

Id: [0x001069A8]
My informant was beaten and his goods, mine really, taken from him. The parasite who did this is near. [beat] Do me a favor, Bayek? Deal with them slowly. Then take whatever you find as your reward.

Id: [0x001069A9]
Thieves, Medjay. They're everywhere. A pestilence. A leader of these thieves stole from me. I asked him to stop. He didn't. So now, why don't you pay him a visit? He'll have something on him that will make the visit worth it.

Id: [0x001069AA]
The Medjay of the hour! You can help me, Bayek. A merchant friend of mine had her goods taken. Perhaps you can find the thief who did it. Have a short... discussion with him. You can take whatever he has.

Id: [0x001069AC]
Oooh. That one is special.

Id: [0x001069AD]
I was saving that for someone extra worthy! I am glad it was you.

Id: [0x001069AE]
Good choice.

Id: [0x001069AF]
I'm going to miss that. It was with me a long time.

Id: [0x001069E8]
Hmm. Maybe if I…

Id: [0x001069F7]
And? What did you see?

Id: [0x001069F8]
Was it as I said?

Id: [0x001069FE]
Do not rush into trouble again.

Id: [0x001069FF]
With you at my side? Never!

Id: [0x00106A0C]
Medjay! A shipment of weapons has gone missing. If you were to find it, I think you might find something of interest. Feel free to grab what you'd like from the stash.

Id: [0x00106A13]
I hope we aren't angering Wadjet.

Id: [0x00106A14]
Nothing to worry about. You did exactly as I would have told you, if you hadn't acted so quickly.

Id: [0x00106A20]
Kition and Heraclides will be in awe. I'll be famous. We'll be famous!

Id: [0x00106A22]
How to get this all back to Alexandria?

Id: [0x00106A24]
Once it is safely in the Library, it will be protected from time and the elements.

Id: [0x00106A26]
Now we can finally remember how Imhotep and Sneferu built the pyramids.

Id: [0x00106A28]
Hmm. I should send for Roussis to help me cart all of these documents back to Alexandria.

Id: [0x00106A33]
The Crocodile has transformed not only the land, but the people: those who do not cower in fear, are made to work for him.

Id: [0x00106A37]
And one in his final masterpiece and tomb, the Shining Pyramid.

Id: [0x00106A38]
The Shining Pyramid?

Id: [0x00106A39]
Yes. Sneferu, whose light shines eternal, lies within.

Id: [0x00106A3A]
Of course.

Id: [0x00106A40]
So you're telling me you do not have the powers of a god?

Id: [0x00106A47]
Citizens of Siwa! Behold what becomes of those who disobey Medunamun, priest to the pharaoh! Take care you faithfully follow his beneficent commands.

Id: [0x00106A49]
You owe all you have: your farms, your goods, your children; you owe your very lives to His Highness, Ptolemy The Benefactor, Ruler of the Two Lands!

Id: [0x00106A4B]
It is a sacred duty to pay taxes to the pharaoh! It is a sacred duty to heed him in all things! To do otherwise is a betrayal of the gods.

Id: [0x00106A4D]
By order of the Royal Court. All villagers are required to come forward with any knowledge concerning the Temple of Amun and any secrets it may hold.

Id: [0x00106A53]
Good news, Layla! Aya's DNA has finished sequencing. You can synch with her memories now.

Id: [0x00106A54]
They're pretty fragmented, but you should be able to dip in for a little while.

Id: [0x00106A55]
I walk on your water.[I am faithful to you.]

Id: [0x00106A58]
Okay, weird.

Id: [0x00106A5D]
Good, good. That was a bit too close, hmm?

Id: [0x00106A66]
These three artifacts fit perfectly into the slots of the capstone. It's a diagram…

Id: [0x00106A68]
From here at the Shining Pyramid, it seems to indicate those ruins out east. That's where we will find the vault.

Id: [0x00106A72]
By Ra! I wonder what we'll find…

Id: [0x00106A76]
One last deadly obstacle…

Id: [0x00106A78]
I told you there was nothing to worry about.

Id: [0x00106A7F]
Hey! Seni! Got an order from a very important customer. Would be a huge help if you could aid me, if you understand my meaning.

Id: [0x00106A80]
Medjay! Need some help finding some items for a friend of mine. I'll make it worth your time, with a Reda guarentee!

Id: [0x00106A81]
You show much fire, for one your age.

Id: [0x00106A82]
They wanted my treasure, so I fought back. Besides, I had to protect Hetanu. If they had found him, they would have killed him. I have been so worried...

Id: [0x00106A84]
One day, though... One day, I'll be just like you. I will liberate the desert so we can all be free.

Id: [0x00106A91]
"Let my heart be a dam, for the flood behind it is strong."

Id: [0x00106A92]
And for now, you will need to be prepared as always- what would you like today?

Id: [0x00106A99]
When you are far, the dam threatens to burst. But now, my love for you flows like the Nile.

Id: [0x00106AC0]
Soon, I hope.

Id: [0x00106AC6]
Your Queen is an unworthy bitch.

Id: [0x00106AC7]
That is no way to talk about a goddess.

Id: [0x00106AC9]
If you are a guardian of Egypt, the country will surely be dead in moments.

Id: [0x00106ACA]
Keep talking, you'll soon find yourself without a head.

Id: [0x00106ACC]
Did you stop by the brothel and see my handiwork?

Id: [0x00106ACD]
Your intimidation is sad. Come, let me give your ka a break.

Id: [0x00106ACF]
You futuo! You think you can change any of our plans?

Id: [0x00106AD0]
You will soon be dead. That is change enough for me.

Id: [0x00106B1D]
If we don't find those kids, Mistress Gaia'll have our hides!

Id: [0x00106B1F]
Birds hiding among reeds - we'll scare them out.

Id: [0x00106B21]
Should we set the bushes on fire?

Id: [0x00106B23]
They're children. They can't have gotten far.

Id: [0x00106B25]
That little witch who set the ship on fire probably freed them.

Id: [0x00106B27]
Where are those little shits?

Id: [0x00106B28]
I must thank her.

Id: [0x00106B3D]
They took him to the Temple of Hathor.

Id: [0x00106B41]
These cat mummies are false!

Id: [0x00106B42]
Why, there's nothing but straw in here!

Id: [0x00106B43]
I won't pay one drachma for this!

Id: [0x00106B44]
You filthy neket iadet! How dare you try to trick me into paying for this junk?

Id: [0x00106B45]
My sister told me she bought a statuette from you, and it broke.

Id: [0x00106B46]
This looks like a child made it!

Id: [0x00106B47]
You sold me an amulet of Hathor, and my wife got sick anyway!

Id: [0x00106B8A]
Luckily for you, I have already paid those bandits a visit and destroyed their stash. Now run along before I change my mind.

Id: [0x00106B93]
The tomb.

Id: [0x00106B94]
Incredible. I hope you will provide me with a similar sarcophagus.

Id: [0x00106B95]
Whatever you want my love.

Id: [0x00106B96]
It is said that his sarcophagus is full of honey. Helps preserve the ka.

Id: [0x00106B97]
(laughs) Unbelievable.

Id: [0x00106B98]
Promise me you will bury me with my blade, so I can protect myself in the Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00106B99]
These markings along the bottom. They speak of Siwa…

Id: [0x00106B9A]
The vault… And a scepter that Alexander holds.

Id: [0x00106B9B]
Amun stands in a field of trees. Where a marked sphere meets its scepter. Man to King, King to God.

Id: [0x00106B9C]
A marked sphere?

Id: [0x00106B9D]
What did you do with the orb I gave you?

Id: [0x00106B9E]
I gave it to Apollodorus, he loves those things-- We should let the others in.

Id: [0x00106B9F]
I am going to keep looking around, these paintings on the wall…

Id: [0x00106BA0]
Day and night, she roams the desert collecting silica.

Id: [0x00106BA1]
Precious tear drops of the gods.

Id: [0x00106BA2]
What has happened to those who have interfered is best left unsaid.

Id: [0x00106BA5]
Promise.

Id: [0x00106BAC]
So you stand with Septimius now! And we are banned from the palace?!

Id: [0x00106BAF]
And where is justice for us? Septimius was supposed to be judged by Rome! Is Caesar protecting the Order?

Id: [0x00106BB0]
There are compromises to make a Queen of Cleopatra!

Id: [0x00106BB1]
The man who killed our son is now your ally! We are going to do whatever it takes to kill him, you realize?

Id: [0x00106BB3]
The Order is stronger now, they have Rome!

Id: [0x00106BB5]
And I promise that for all the sons of Egypt I will be the father I was not that day in Siwa.

Id: [0x00106BB6]
To the brotherhood!

Id: [0x00106BB7]
Hello

Id: [0x00106BB8]
Hello Bayek

Id: [0x00106BB9]
So how about this weather huh?

Id: [0x00106BBA]
Yes it has been terrible, I heard some folks got Frogs from the sky.

Id: [0x00106BBB]
Someone else was speaking about hail of fire, I think they were mistaking their prohecies though.

Id: [0x00106BBD]
Bayek of Siwa, you don't know what you are up against.

Id: [0x00106BBF]
The Crocodile has transformed not only the land, but the people: those who do not cower in fear, are made to work for him.

Id: [0x00106BC4]
And you have no idea who the Crocodile is?

Id: [0x00106BCC]
Come along!

Id: [0x00106BCD]
Medjay!

Id: [0x00106BCE]
Forward!

Id: [0x00106BCF]
Enough delay! Come!

Id: [0x00106BDD]
Medjay!

Id: [0x00106BDE]
Wait!

Id: [0x00106BDF]
Let us proceed.

Id: [0x00106BE0]
This way.

Id: [0x00106BE1]
There is nothing to fear.

Id: [0x00106BE2]
I assure you, you want to see this.

Id: [0x00106BE5]
As I was saying ...

Id: [0x00106BE6]
To the subject at hand ...

Id: [0x00106FED]
Medjay, we cannot thank you enough for your help. You are sent from the gods. I was sure we were going to die, but now I have hope.

Id: [0x00106FEE]
With you we have a chance. These bandits are demons. But whether we live or die, I am thankful for your help.

Id: [0x00106FEF]
I thought the old Medjay were all gone. You give me hope again.

Id: [0x00106FF4]
You're Medjay aren't you? I can't trust anyone else! Please help!

Id: [0x00106FF5]
Neb! I need your help. There's no-one else I can turn to.

Id: [0x00106FF6]
Neb! I must speak with you!

Id: [0x00106FFA]
Neb! Please! I must speak with you!

Id: [0x00106FFB]
Those Phylakitai have gone too far! They stole a convoy that my friend - a good woman - had been awaiting. Deal with them, Bayek, and what you find is yours.

Id: [0x00106FFC]
Some soldiers took a convoy of goods from our Egyptian brothers, seni. Go and take it back.

Id: [0x00106FFD]
These damned soldiers do not know when to stop. They take a tax and then just take goods from our people! Maybe you can prove to them just how wrong their actions are.

Id: [0x00106FFE]
Seni! Soldiers stole items I had an eye on. They claim it is their due for protecting our people, but if this is protection I'd rather fight my own battles. Wait! You can get it back. Even better, you can keep whatever you find!

Id: [0x00106FFF]
Those filthy Phylakitai took a convoy of goods. Prove to them they have to pay for things like everyone else, Medjay. I'm sure there will be something of value for your effort.

Id: [0x00107023]
APOLLODORUS

Id: [0x00107024]
What is the bloody rush!?

Id: [0x00107025]
Ease up my love!

Id: [0x00107026]
Stay beside me!

Id: [0x00107027]
Stay close by!

Id: [0x00107028]
To me, Bayek!

Id: [0x00107029]
Stay close my love!

Id: [0x0010702A]
Stay out of sight.

Id: [0x0010702B]
Let's get out of here.

Id: [0x0010702C]
Holy hades, now, what was it we were talking about?

Id: [0x0010702D]
Let's begin again.

Id: [0x0010702E]
Heavily fortified. Behave my love.

Id: [0x0010702F]
Bayek there is trouble ahead.

He won't be needing this anymore, Medjay. Best give it to you. I'm sure you'll find a use for it.

Id: [0x00107046]
Sad to hear of his passing. But good news for you - his weapon was made for him special. Perhaps you'll have better use of it.

Id: [0x00107047]
Dead men need no weapons, so how about you use his. Special order, it'll suit you just fine.

Id: [0x00107048]
May he find peace in the Duat, Medjay. Since you found him, you can have the weapon I got for him special. He would have liked it that way.

Id: [0x00107049]
Now... what to do with this weapon he paid for? Ah, silly Reda. You have it, Medjay. You have a greater need for it seeing as you're alive and he's...not.

They brought a child earlier, but she escaped. She must be hiding nearby. Find her and get her out of here while I distract the guards!

Id: [0x00107461]
The child in the cell escaped, and is hiding in the hay cart. Help her back to one of our camps! I will buy you both time!

Id: [0x0010749D]
Yes.

Id: [0x001074B7]

Your son's death made the Order bow to me. Caesar even. I had Rome.

Id: [0x001074E3]
This task you've put yourself to. It seems impossible.

Id: [0x001074E4]
(laughs) Only the gods can know that for sure, Bayek. And if I do not reach for the stars, how will I know how close I can get?

Id: [0x001074E5]
Letopolis was a wonder once, before the desert overtook it. I mean to show the world, to show the gods, that men can conquer anything if they put their minds to it.

Id: [0x001074E6]
Perhaps you have been sent by the gods to help me realize my vision. A strong arm, a keen eye. We could restore this land to glory.

Id: [0x001074E7]
I have my own great work ahead of me.

Id: [0x001074E8]
We shall see if I cannot convince you!

Id: [0x001074EA]
Will you meditate with me, Deliverer?

Id: [0x001074EC]
Let us begin the meditation.

Id: [0x001074EE]
The ritual requires you to meditate.

Id: [0x001074F3]
A bed tucked away, shielded from sandstorms.

Id: [0x001074F4]
The lotus. A symbol of rebirth.

Id: [0x001074F5]
These cages are big enough for a man.

Id: [0x001074F7]
Someone has sealed this room. The smell of the blood I spilled still lingers here.

Id: [0x001074F9]
I'll take you home.

Id: [0x001074FC]
Bayek, come fight with me!<LF>

Id: [0x0010750F]
I do not know why Teta hates me so much.

Id: [0x00107511]
She sells bread, I sell fruit. There is no reason for competition.

Id: [0x00107513]
I have heard Teta cursing me, but so far my liver seems fine.

Id: [0x00107599]
May its soul rest in peace.

Id: [0x0010759A]
Sobek guards this tomb.

Id: [0x001075BB]
I need to be sure the way is safe for Cleopatra. We have to do this!

Id: [0x001075E7]
Before I leave, I give one last gift to Alexandria! Come and get me you cowardly horse fuckers!

Id: [0x0010773D]
No, I have not. Are you planning on coming to the orgy?

Id: [0x00107A59]
Oh, [habibti](sweetheart)... I should have listened to you. Oh, [habibti](sweetheart)... I should have listened to you.

Id: [0x00107B01]
I head to Rome to-

Id: [0x00107B80]
Aya, dear one, thank you for coming. All is well with great Caesar.

Id: [0x00107B81]
Good my queen. Soon you will be on your throne.

Id: [0x00107B82]
Yes, yes. I must ask you a favor though: The tomb... I feel Lord Caesar should have the honor to bear witness to the author of our kingdom, Alexander the Great.

Id: [0x00107B83]
You want to impress your new lover, I see. The tomb is sealed, no?

Id: [0x00107B84]
It is, but by an act of Gaia, not a royal decree.

Id: [0x00107B85]
An earthquake in the early days of my father's reign has blocked the door.

Id: [0x00107B86]
Do you know our metropolis well enough to suggest an alternate means of entry?

Id: [0x00107B87]
The underground.

Id: [0x00107B88]
You would enter from below?

Id: [0x00107B89]
Well, I would find a way into the cisterns and canals below, work backwards and find a way to clear a passage into the tomb.

Id: [0x00107B8A]
That would solve our problem but it seems idealistic.

Id: [0x00107B8B]
Fortune favors those who ignore her. I'll examine the area around the tomb and figure this out.

Id: [0x00107B8C]
Excellent. Rejoice.

Id: [0x00107BA6]
May your victories multiply.

Id: [0x00107BAF]
Not forever.

Id: [0x00107BC0]
Where's your Medjay friend?

Id: [0x00107BC1]
There's the Medjay!

Id: [0x00107BC2]
Kill him!

Id: [0x00107BC3]
Kill his friend and I'll take care of the Medjay.

Id: [0x00107BC4]
You are supposed to be dead!

Id: [0x00107BC5]
And you will be. We will make sure of that.

Id: [0x00107BD5]
Have you begun the hunt yet my Bayek?

Id: [0x00107BD6]
You should begin your journey my love.

Id: [0x00107BD7]
The Order of Ancients has no idea what is coming their way.

Id: [0x00107BD8]
I will be heading north soon to defend Cleopatra at sea.

Id: [0x00107BD9]
Ouf, my head still aches from last night...

Id: [0x00107BE2]
It is not your rebelliousness that got you killed seni. It is Ptolemy's sick regime. He is a bad pharaoh.

Id: [0x00107C25]
So Caesar is the King of the order now?

Id: [0x00107C26]
Caesar is the father of understanding.

Id: [0x00107C27]
You and Caesar will die.

Id: [0x00107C28]
It is only a matter of days before Caesar will officially become a tyrant.

Id: [0x00107C29]
There he is.

Id: [0x00107C4B]
Papo, what is a Medjay, really?

Id: [0x00107C4C]
The first Medjay was a protector of the pharaoh. But now it means you must protect all the people of Egypt. Not just protect them, but work for their well-being.

Id: [0x00107C4D]
The sand is so hot on my feet!

Id: [0x00107C4E]
Sometimes they light on fire. It makes you faster.

Id: [0x00107C4F]
(laughs) I want my feet to light on fire!

Id: [0x00107C50]
I love you my boy. And they will light on fire one day!

Id: [0x00107C51]
I love you too papo.

Id: [0x00107C52]
Great library?

Id: [0x00107C53]
And she said if you were coming to tell you one word: "Serapis".

Id: [0x00107C54]
Serapis? The god that greeks and egyptians share. Of course... I see...

Id: [0x00107C55]
I love you Khemu.

Id: [0x00107C56]
Chenzira told me I should steal his feathers, so that my weighing ceremony gets me to The Field of Reeds.

Id: [0x00107C57]
(laughs)[and then calms quickly] Anubis weighs your heart against a feather. You cannot tamper with this weighing ceremony. It is sacred.

Id: [0x00107C58]
Thank you Bayek. I told you these [neket iadets](pieces of shit) do not care.

Id: [0x00107C59]
I cannot believe their gall.

Id: [0x00107C5C]
The desert is beautiful.

Id: [0x00107C5D]
Yes Khemu. We are lucky the gods gave us Siwa.

Id: [0x00107C5E]
I can't remember which god is responsible for the desert?

Id: [0x00107C5F]
Set. He rides a sun boat in order to combat Apep.

Id: [0x00107C61]
What if the pharaoh does bad things?

Id: [0x00107C62]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00107C63]
What do you do if you are Medjay, and the pharaoh is bad?

Id: [0x00107C64]
The pharaoh thinks only of the people of Egypt, Khemu. Everything he does is for our glory.

Id: [0x00107C65]
Papo?

Id: [0x00107C67]
Jump.

Id: [0x00107C69]
I feel as though wherever we go, tragedy follows. Perhaps we should come to terms…

Id: [0x00107C6A]
It is hard. I don't want to let go but...

Id: [0x00107C6B]
Every time I think of you I think of Khemu and everything we lost.

Id: [0x00107C72]
Me too. So for now. We kill.

Id: [0x00107C73]
Farewell Aya.

Id: [0x00107C79]
Alalalala!

Id: [0x00107C83]
Bayek! Come here!

Id: [0x00107C85]
I'm almost done preparing your camel, give me a few moments please.

Id: [0x00107C86]
You have a long journey ahead, let me make sure you have not forgotten anything. Give me a moment before you leave.

Id: [0x00107C88]
Not ready yet? I understand. So much to do in Siwa. People need you here.

Id: [0x00107C89]
You are staying, good. Are you going to visit Khemu at the necropolis?

Aaaaaaah!

Id: [0x00107F7F]
I believe in you.

Id: [0x0010828C]
Hmm. Do I wait for this horseman to come back to his cave at night... or seek him out as he roams and terrorizes Giza?

Id: [0x0010828E]
I must protect this great land.

Id: [0x0010828F]
Alexandria is where the Snake thrives and Aya lives. I must find them both.

Id: [0x00108291]
May the gods help me, I am coming for you Aya.

Id: [0x00108293]
Serapis...

Id: [0x00108294]
The Snake will get his answer.

Id: [0x00108298]
This is where Aya and I used to hide when we first fell in love.

Id: [0x00108299]
Our love began here. Perhaps it should end here.

Id: [0x001082A1]
I should leave. Nothing more to see here.

Id: [0x001082B7]
BENIPE

Id: [0x001082C7]
She will never fall to you or your kind.

Id: [0x0010831D]
???

Id: [0x00108321]
Ahhh yes, Phanos, nice to meet you in person. Tell me what is happening with Aya, why are you being so discreet?

Id: [0x001084F0]
By all the gods! Have they sent a message from the sky? It's as if Ra has descended upon us.

Id: [0x001084F4]
The fireball has revealed an entrance to this tomb. This is a sign from the gods.

Id: [0x001084F7]
Could this be referring to a sun dial? I wonder.

Id: [0x0010850D]
This must be the sun dial that was depicted in the tomb.

Id: [0x00108510]
It seems to be working.

Id: [0x00108512]
It is reacting.

Id: [0x00108515]
O you door-keepers who guard your portals, who swallow souls and who gulp down the corpses of the dead.

Id: [0x00108517]
What a journey I have made, the things I have seen. I am but one of you.

Id: [0x00108533]
What has this man done to deserve such abuse?

Id: [0x00108534]
He fled like a rank coward, leaving my gladiators to be taken captive.

Id: [0x00108536]
Gladiators? Can’t they protect themselves?

Id: [0x00108537]
They were sleeping. Egidio here was meant to keep watch... Kosey and Wamukota! My two best gladiators!

Id: [0x0010853A]
We were on our way to the arena and were ambushed by bandits. I managed to escape.

Id: [0x0010853B]
You damn coward!

Id: [0x0010853C]
I will get your gladiators back, but leave this poor man alone.

Id: [0x0010853F]
We were attacked northeast from here. Near a wooden bridge on the road to Cyrene.

Id: [0x00108540]
When you find my men, bring them to the Cyrene Arena right away.

Id: [0x00108541]
Come Egidio. We may win the championship yet!

Id: [0x00108543]
Where is Wamukota? Where is Kosey?

Id: [0x00108544]
The tournament will soon begin!

Id: [0x00108545]
You said you would help me!

Id: [0x00108546]
This is the bridge Egidio mentioned. The bandits must be nearby.

Id: [0x00108547]
Here is one gladiator.

Id: [0x00108548]
He appears to be drugged. I will get him out of here.

Id: [0x00108549]
He might know where the other one is.

Id: [0x0010854A]
Or there may be a clue inside the camp.

Id: [0x0010854B]
“Kosey”? That is the name of one of the gladiators. He faked his own abduction?

Id: [0x0010854C]
I need to find the lake in the mountain to the north.

Id: [0x0010854D]
Uuuh ... who ... are you?

Id: [0x0010854E]
Egidio sent me to find you.

Id: [0x0010854F]
Can you walk?

Id: [0x00108550]
I'll try.

Id: [0x00108551]
Your name is Wamukota, yes? I found a letter from Kosey.

Id: [0x00108552]
(coughing) That bastard! I can't believe he set up a trap! Is Egidio all right?

Id: [0x00108556]
He's fine. He's with your owner at Cyrene Arena if you want to join them.

Id: [0x00108557]
Do you know where Kosey went?

Id: [0x00108558]
The bandits said something about a lake in the mountain to the north.

Id: [0x00108559]
You should go get some rest. I will find Kosey.

Id: [0x0010855A]
Are you all right? Where is the other gladiator?

Id: [0x0010855B]
(coughing) That bastard. He betrayed us. He faked his own abduction!

Id: [0x0010855C]
What?

Id: [0x0010855E]
The bandits spoke to Kosey as a friend and gave him a horse.

Id: [0x00108560]
Do you have any idea where he went?

Id: [0x00108562]
They told him everything was ready at the lake in the mountain to the north. If you find him, punch him in the face for me, will you?

Id: [0x00108563]
(laughs) Sure. Thanasis and Egidio are at the Cyrene Arena, waiting for you. You should rest first, though.

Id: [0x00108567]
This must be the lake Wamukota mentioned.

Id: [0x00108568]
Now where is Kosey?

Id: [0x00108569]
A child all alone?

Id: [0x0010856A]
Hello, little one! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0010856B]
I'm not little! I'm five years old!

Id: [0x0010856C]
I'm sorry! My name is Bayek. What is yours?

Id: [0x0010856D]
Zalika! Get home to your mother. Now!

Id: [0x0010856E]
Kosey! Stop!

Id: [0x0010856F]
I won't go back!

Id: [0x00108570]
I am not here to fight you, Kosey.

Id: [0x00108571]
I'm done with all of it! You'll be the last man I kill.

Id: [0x00108572]
Hold on, calm down.

Id: [0x00108573]
You won't listen, will you?

Id: [0x00108574]
(Yells on attack)

Id: [0x00108575]
Your dead body will be my answer to Thanasis!

Id: [0x00108576]
Just hear what I have to say!

Id: [0x00108578]
I am done talking.

Id: [0x0010857B]
No more of Thanasis' dirty tricks!

Id: [0x0010857C]
I had the money to buy my freedom. He didn't care!

Id: [0x0010857D]
I am not your enemy.

Id: [0x0010857E]
Enough!

Id: [0x00108580]
Fight me like a man!

Id: [0x00108581]
A coward like your master!

Id: [0x00108582]
Come back and I'll kill you.

Id: [0x00108583]
Haven't you had enough?

Id: [0x001085A1]
Look at her. I missed her first few years but I'll be there for her now.

Id: [0x001085A2]
Hesper is a strong woman. She raised Zalika by herself.

Id: [0x001085A3]
The bandits drugged Wamukota. I needed him to keep silent until I got away.

Id: [0x001085A8]
Excuse my husband. It has been a difficult journey.

Id: [0x001085A9]
Wamukota told me what happened.

Id: [0x001085AA]
I'm glad he's safe. I didn't want him to get hurt.

Id: [0x001085AB]
Why fake your own abduction? Could you not buy your freedom from Thanasis?

Id: [0x001085AC]
I tried, but he refused. As his best gladiator, I can bring him fame beyond price.

Id: [0x001085B0]
Stay with your family, Kosey. I will deal with Thanasis.

Id: [0x001085B2]
You are truly sent by the gods!

Id: [0x001085B3]
Aurelius will be at the tournament. The most influential of all the gladiator masters.

Id: [0x001085B4]
I must not disappoint him.

Id: [0x001085B5]
Did you find replacement gladiators?

Id: [0x001085B6]
No, Thanasis. No one would accept at that price.

Id: [0x001085B7]
May the gods damn them! They would bleed me dry.

Id: [0x001085B8]
I’ll show the Romans. They think I’m not good enough. They think no one is as good as they are.

Id: [0x001085B9]
We’ll show them, master.

Id: [0x001085BA]
We must formally enter soon, or we will not be permitted in the tournament.

Id: [0x001085BB]
I cannot believe I'm so close. Where are they?

Id: [0x001085BC]
Ah! There you are. Where are my gladiators?

Id: [0x001085BF]
They will not come. Wamukota is wounded, and Kosey has declared his freedom.

Id: [0x001085C1]
What? I own Kosey! I say whether he's free or not.

Id: [0x001085C2]
He is gone. I advise you find other fighters.

Id: [0x001085C3]
Now there is an idea. I have a deal for you. You fight for me. Win and I'll give you rich rewards.

Id: [0x001085C6]
That and sign formally for Kosey's freedom.

Id: [0x001085C7]
I like your style! Enter the arena. And win! Make me proud!

Id: [0x001085C9]
Please help Kosey, whatever it takes.

Id: [0x001085CA]
Kosey deserves a happy life.

Id: [0x001085CB]
I knew it was a trick, but I played along to fool Thanasis.

Id: [0x001085CD]
I won. Where is your master?

Id: [0x001085CE]
Please, you must help Kosey.

Id: [0x001085CF]
Wamukota came back and told us what he did.

Id: [0x001085D0]
Master Thanasis paid some Roman soldiers, and they all went to get Kosey back.

Id: [0x001085D1]
That rat. Egidio, you'd best find a new master.

Id: [0x001085D2]
If you hurt my father again, I will beat you!

Id: [0x001085D3]
Don't walk there! You will scare the ants!

Id: [0x001085D4]
Can I play with your bow?

Id: [0x001085D6]
Let us hope that all this is behind us now.

Id: [0x001085D7]
Kosey is an even better father than he is a fighter.

Id: [0x001085D8]
Zalika is so much like her father. You should see her when she’s angry!

Id: [0x001085DB]
Be careful, friend. Kosey is very strong!

Id: [0x001085E1]
It's over there. Hurry!

Id: [0x001085E2]
You win, Kosey will be free. Simple!

Id: [0x001085E3]
After a round, yell out that you fight for Thanasis.

Id: [0x001085E6]
Nek. I hope I am not too late.

Id: [0x001085E7]
Thanasis!

Id: [0x001085E8]
You belong to me, Kosey!

Id: [0x001085E9]
I decide your fate, boy.

Id: [0x001085EA]
Leave my father alone!

Id: [0x001085EB]
Zalika! Stay back!

Id: [0x001085EC]
You want to keep your family safe, don't you?

Id: [0x001085ED]
So calmly come with me. You can send them money from your winnings.

Id: [0x001085EE]
Let him go, Thanasis! He's done enough!

Id: [0x001085EF]
Quiet, you! I tolerated your little love story long enough. You ruined everything!

Id: [0x001085F0]
Please, leave them alone.

Id: [0x001085F1]
I’ll keep my eye on them. Why would you fight for me if there is no carrot at the end of the stick?

Id: [0x001085F2]
Think about that.

Id: [0x001085F4]
You not only betrayed me, you also sent someone after me.

Id: [0x001085F5]
He's probably lying dead in Cyrene Arena by now.

Id: [0x001085F7]
Zalika. Tell your father to obey me or I will make him suffer more!

Id: [0x001085F8]
My father will kill you first!

Id: [0x001085F9]
(laughs) She clearly is your daughter, Kosey.

Id: [0x001085FD]
I ... I ...

Id: [0x001085FE]
Louder, boy! I cannot hear you!

Id: [0x001085FF]
I will make you pay.

Id: [0x00108600]
Such ingratitude.

Id: [0x00108601]
You?! Kill him!

Id: [0x00108602]
Bayek!

Id: [0x00108603]
Hesper! Take Zalika and hide!

Id: [0x00108604]
I thought you'd be dead in the arena.

Id: [0x00108605]
We had a deal, Thanasis.

Id: [0x00108606]
You are a fool.

Id: [0x00108607]
I trained Kosey since he was eight years old.

Id: [0x00108608]
I own him!

Id: [0x00108609]
You will own nothing in the Duat.

Id: [0x0010860B]
You do not know who you are dealing with.

Id: [0x0010860C]
I know enough.

Id: [0x0010860F]
You would have made a fine gladiator.

Id: [0x00108610]
The money we could have made.

Id: [0x00108611]
That is all of them. You are safe.

Id: [0x00108613]
You are a free man now, Kosey.

Id: [0x00108614]
Our son will be named after you.

Id: [0x00108615]
A son? Your family is growing?

Id: [0x00108616]
Yes. And thanks to you, Kosey will be here to see it.

Id: [0x0010861D]
It's not much, but take this.

Id: [0x0010861E]
I have no use for it, now.

Id: [0x0010861F]
Farewell my friend. I hope our paths cross again.

Id: [0x00108620]
It feels good to be a free man.

Id: [0x00108622]
I never talked to you about it. You really won that tournament? I'm impressed.

Id: [0x00108623]
Zalika is excited to have a little brother.

Id: [0x00108624]
You are welcome here any time.

Id: [0x00108625]
Zalika is happy to have her father around.

Id: [0x00108659]
My father could have killed that man alone!

Id: [0x0010865A]
When I grow up, I want to fight in the arena!

Id: [0x0010865B]
Do you have a wife? You're old, you should have a wife.

Id: [0x00108682]
This is a disaster! You'll answer for that I swear to all the gods!

Id: [0x00108683]
I'm sorry master! We were outnumbered and...

Id: [0x00108684]
I trusted you Egidio. Do you know how much they worth??!!

Id: [0x00108685]
I'll find some men and we'll get them back.

Id: [0x00108686]
Fucking Donkey! We're in Roman territory....where do you plan to find more men?!

Id: [0x00108687]
My reputation will be ruined...

Id: [0x00108688]
Ten years...TEN FUCKING YEARS!

Id: [0x00108689]
This was supposed to be the Pinnacle of my carreer, a direct ticket to Rome's best Arenas...

Id: [0x0010868A]
I bet they'll try to ransom me...ME!

Id: [0x0010868B]
I'm sorry master...

Id: [0x0010868C]
Silence! Just let me think...

Id: [0x0010868D]
Those fucking useless Roman soldier, looking down on me...

Id: [0x0010868E]
They said they'll try to find them...we can only wait.

Id: [0x0010868F]
I don't have time to wait, stupid worm!

Id: [0x001086F2]
Just remember: I do not work for you.

Id: [0x00108702]
You’re to blame! And I swear you’ll answer for it.

Id: [0x00108703]
We were outnumbered!

Id: [0x00108704]
Do you have any idea how much those men are worth?

Id: [0x00108705]
I'll find some mercenaries to help get them back.

Id: [0x00108706]
Where do you think we are? There are no mercenaries here. Idiot.

Id: [0x00108707]
Ten years! I trained those men for ten years! I finally had the talent to get me to Rome. Rome!

Id: [0x00108708]
They're going to make me pay a ransom. That's the only thing that makes sense.

Id: [0x00108709]
My most sincere apologies, Thanasis.

Id: [0x0010870A]
Silence! I'm thinking. Stupid worm.

Id: [0x0010870B]
You’re to blame! And I swear you’ll answer for it.

Id: [0x0010870C]
We were outnumbered!

Id: [0x0010870D]
Do you have any idea how much those men are worth?

Id: [0x0010870E]
I will find some mercenaries to help get them back.

Id: [0x0010870F]
Where do you think we are? There are no mercenaries here. Idiot.

Id: [0x00108710]
Ten years! I trained those men for ten years! I finally had the talent to get me to Rome. Rome!

Id: [0x00108711]
They're going to make me pay a ransom. That's the only thing that makes sense.

Id: [0x00108712]
My most sincere apologies, Thanasis.

Id: [0x00108713]
Silence! I'm thinking. Stupid worm.

Id: [0x0010871B]
Light shining up to the gods? By Ra, what have I done?

Id: [0x0010871C]
I should check the tomb.

Id: [0x0010871E]
This number seems important.

Id: [0x00108778]
Bayek! Bayek of Siwa! I have a letter for you.

Id: [0x0010877F]
Will Siwa never know peace? I will go to the Saragina Camp to learn if there is any truth to this letter.

Id: [0x00108781]
I must let Rome know that Siwa is never to be harmed again. None of these men will survive.

Id: [0x00108785]
Sharpen your swords, men! You'll need them.

Id: [0x00108787]
Strike the fear of Anubis into 'em!

Id: [0x00108789]
Anyone offers resistance, show no mercy.

Id: [0x0010878B]
Take it quickly and our Roman patron will pay well.

Id: [0x0010878D]
Soon, men. Soon.

Id: [0x00108791]
So much for the commander. He may be carrying important information.

Id: [0x00108793]
Ah! This may tell me what their plan is.

Id: [0x00108798]
I will destroy these carts. And Jibade will soon meet Anubis.

Id: [0x0010879B]
Jibade must be somewhere in this fortress.

Id: [0x0010879E]
Any news from Siwa?

Id: [0x0010879F]
No. I've sent a patrol to establish contact. Captain Adras is probably busy burning the bodies.

Id: [0x001087A1]
I confess I'm uncomfortable with forcing Egyptian troops to join us. I swore allegiance to Cleopatra just as this general has.

Id: [0x001087A2]
Don't be an idiot. This man's allegiance is for sale. Enough troops to intimidate him and he'll be happy with the price. Wait patiently, commander.

Id: [0x001087A4]
The fort commander is still unwilling to join us.

Id: [0x001087A5]
Soon more soldiers will arrive. We'll outnumber him four to one! He'll have to give in.

Id: [0x001087A7]
He'll try to hold out in his fortress. We'll impose a siege and starve them out.

Id: [0x001087A8]
Excellent idea.

Id: [0x001087AA]
I'll release extra rations of beer in the meantime. Good for morale.

Id: [0x001087AC]
If the rumor is true, the object from Siwa will give us the power to make all Egypt ours.

Id: [0x001087AE]
You'll get nothing from me!

Id: [0x001087B0]
It wasn't coercion, it was liberation!

Id: [0x001087B2]
We only mean to bring glory to Egypt!

Id: [0x001087B6]
Very well. I've done what I can. Now I will see Otis in Alexandria. He may have found out what this is all about.

Id: [0x001087B8]
Now to destroy the carts.

Id: [0x001087BB]
That must be one of the carts.

Id: [0x001087BE]
That is one, now the other two.

Id: [0x001087C1]
There. One more.

Id: [0x001087C3]
So much for their bribery.

Id: [0x001087C7]
Very well. I've done what I can. Now I will see Otis in Alexandria. He may have found out what this is all about.

Id: [0x001087C9]
Very well. Now Jibade will meet my blade.

Id: [0x001087CC]
What are all these soldiers doing here?

Id: [0x001087CF]
What has happened here?

Id: [0x001087D4]
Wearing the robes of a scribe. It is indeed Otis, poor man. Signs of torture, someone tried to make him talk.

Id: [0x001087D8]
Poor girl. One of the servants.

Id: [0x001087DB]
They were determined to leave no witnesses.

Id: [0x001087DE]
Letters and papers from the royal palace, nothing of use here.

Id: [0x001087E1]
A collection of poetry, not what I’m looking for.

Id: [0x001087E4]
Scrolls about the palace budget, nothing of interest.

Id: [0x001087E5]
Palace documents about relations with Rome.

Id: [0x001087E8]
Traces of a fight. Otis tried to resist.

Id: [0x001087EB]
This is Otis's blood. He tried to flee.

Id: [0x001087EE]
This jar has something in it.

Id: [0x001087F1]
Hidden notes. Must be important.

Id: [0x001087F8]
You did fine work to gather this information, Otis. As you traverse the duat, I swear to you:

Id: [0x001087FB]
This body. I fear it is Otis.

Id: [0x00108806]
You are Bayek, yes? My master is anxious that you get this letter. It is urgent!

Id: [0x00108808]
Your master? Do I know him?

Id: [0x00108809]
His name is Otis. You haven't met. All is explained in the letter.

Id: [0x0010880D]
He was attacked in his sleep.

Id: [0x0010880F]
If I get the chance I will make certain this General Rufio pays.

Id: [0x0010886F]
Rumors from Thebes abound! The gods are angry! Stories of horrors unimaginable, brought forth by golden light from the gods!

Id: [0x00108873]
It comes from the south, friends. The gods send us the gift of death! It is a deliverance! For well we know that this life of blood and bone is mere fantasy.

Id: [0x00108877]
Soldiers! Hear me!

Id: [0x0010887B]
Could this be the "golden light" I heard about? What is this place?

Id: [0x00108880]
What sort of men are these?

Id: [0x00108884]
What possesses these men?

Id: [0x00108889]
Aaah! My leg. Help me!

Id: [0x00108897]
There is the camel. What are they doing?

Id: [0x0010889D]
I must return it to its place and end this nightmare.

Id: [0x001088A1]
Are you here?

Id: [0x001088AE]
Where am I?

Id: [0x001088B3]
Ah, you're awake at last.

Id: [0x001088BC]
I have news from Thebes! Come listen!

Id: [0x001088BD]
Captains, Lieutenants, men of arms! Egypt needs you to fight a remorseless foe, come from the other side of death! Yes!

Id: [0x001088BF]
He smells like death!

Id: [0x001088C0]
Some dark spirit has unleashed these soldiers.

Id: [0x001088C1]
Do I dream?

Id: [0x001088C9]
I am lucky to be alive. I was attacked by corpses dressed like soldiers.

Id: [0x001088CA]
Are you an adventurer or a grave robber?

Id: [0x001088CB]
A man must live. I entered and saw many bodies, dead these centuries. And beyond them, a glowing object.

Id: [0x001088CC]
That is an old legend. Thousands of men lost forever in a sandstorm.

Id: [0x001088CD]
I believe they carried much gold. As I approached, I saw a golden light!

Id: [0x001088CE]
"At last!" I thought, "The gods have chosen me for the treasure of the Lost Army!"

Id: [0x001088CF]
I grabbed it and immediately heard strange sounds. I quickly loaded it onto my camel when suddenly horrifying soldiers attacked! The camel fled into the desert.

Id: [0x001088D3]
No. You must find my camel and bring back the glowing object. I am certain that it brought the Lost Army back from the dead.

Id: [0x001088DC]
I will find out what happened. Stay hidden here.

Id: [0x001088DD]
Here. I will help you get to safety.

Id: [0x001088DE]
I have recovered the object!

Id: [0x001088DF]
Where has he gone?

Id: [0x001088E1]
More of these fiends?!

Id: [0x001088ED]
We found you wandering dazed in the desert.

Id: [0x001088EF]
Where is the adventurer? And the object?

Id: [0x001088F0]
We found only you, muttering about the "Lost Army".

Id: [0x001088F1]
I battled with soldiers returned from the Duat.

Id: [0x001088F2]
Let us pray you were simply overcome by heat! These strange rumors from Thebes terrify everyone. Pray Osiris that none are true!

Id: [0x001088F8]
I met them myself. How did you come to be here?

Id: [0x001088F9]
I came in search of the Lost Army of Cambyses.

Id: [0x00108905]
Come, listen! Everyone!

Id: [0x00108906]
Will no one listen to me? We are all in danger!

Id: [0x0010890E]
Golden light near Thebes? I should see this for myself.

Id: [0x00108915]
"Golden light from the gods" on the road to Thebes? I may want to investigate these "horrors".

Id: [0x0010891A]
"Light of gold." "Restless souls." What could this mean?

Id: [0x0010891C]
Hear me! The world will soon be no more! We will all walk in the Duat together!

Id: [0x0010891D]
Come listen! Our earthly travails have come to an end!

Id: [0x0010891E]
Join me, Egyptians, we must redouble our tributes to Osiris and Iset. To Horus and Hathor! To Apep and Geb! We must keep Amun-Ra in our thoughts at all times.

Id: [0x0010891F]
We hear the tales from Thebes! Light of gold brings forth restless souls to wander the desert.

Id: [0x00108920]
I have heard the tales, south, near Thebes, things beyond mortal understanding have been loosed upon the land. Heralded by ghostly, golden light!

Id: [0x00108922]
Have the dead risen?

Id: [0x00108925]
This was not like this when I last came. It is the light I saw in Siwa.

Id: [0x00108929]
This is a soldier. Could the Legend of the Lost Army of Cambyses be true?

Id: [0x0010892B]
Poor animal.

Id: [0x0010892D]
This is it.

Id: [0x00108930]
Stories too strange to repeat. I am sure they are foolish fantasies, but I will not go there myself.

Id: [0x00108936]
Tell me more about these rumors from Thebes.

Id: [0x00108938]
That eagle deserves your thanks. Nomads saw it circling in the desert.

Id: [0x00108939]
She is a good friend.

Id: [0x0010893D]
Here they are, awakened from their slumber. One by one ... so many ... A library.  A repository.

Id: [0x0010893E]
We extinguished the flame. Knowledge will return. Eventually. The Eye, the temples. The vaults and the Apples.

Id: [0x0010893F]
Until then, how much benighted use will this power serve? It may take ages until your kind becomes enlightened.

Id: [0x00108940]
Who stands in this chamber? At long last, a light has been cast. But I fear your blood is the thickest of shadows.

I can tell you that killing me will bring you no redemption.

Id: [0x00108954]
Be done with me. Vanquish me. My existence was a mistake anyways.

EGYPTIAN SOLDIER

Id: [0x00108964]
MAN

Id: [0x00108A7A]
We’re here, our contact inside has informed us that the Magnate has taken residence in the Keep. We believe he has already signed the terms of the truce.

Id: [0x00108A7B]
Don’t worry; neither the document nor the Magnate will leave this 

Id: [0x00108A7C]
Although your assurance pleases me, raw strength won’t exactly cut it this time

Id: [0x00108A7D]
Ahhh, you hooded-ones drain the fun out of everything

Id: [0x00108A7E]
Once you’ve disposed of our friend the Magnate, stab this knife in his back, make it look… “Inspired”.

Id: [0x00108A7F]
Hoping to change the tides of war, heh?

Id: [0x00108A80]
Something like that.

Id: [0x00108A81]
Not staying?

Id: [0x00108A82]
Of course not.

Id: [0x00108A83]
Good day Sir, Is something troubling you?

Id: [0x00108A84]
Not particulary, i was just loosing up these old legs.

Id: [0x00108A85]
I see; i do have to insit though that no civilians be allowed pass this perimeter.

Id: [0x00108A86]
Very well.

Id: [0x00108A87]
Good day.

Id: [0x00108A88]
State your business.

Id: [0x00108A89]
Delivery for the Fort's Garrison, i'm exepected.

Id: [0x00108A8A]
Very well, proceed.

Id: [0x00108A8B]
You! You're not from here I can tell. Are you a traveller?

Id: [0x00108A8C]
We could say that, yes.

Id: [0x00108A8D]
You're the man I need! Fancy making a bit of money?

Id: [0x00108A8E]
Always...I'm all hears.

Id: [0x00108A8F]
I need this to be delivered to a woman named Mary in Clatson. 

Id: [0x00108A90]
It's not that far...why can't you go by yourself?

Id: [0x00108A91]
Well...let's say my wife has eyes everywhere...

Id: [0x00108A92]
haha. I'll see what I can do.

Id: [0x00108A93]
Are you alright? I heard someone sobbing.

Id: [0x00108A94]
Yes I'm alright...wait...I never saw you here.

Id: [0x00108A95]
I'm indeed not from here, just passing.

Id: [0x00108A96]
We don't see a lot of new faces here...sniff...

Id: [0x00108A97]
I won't bother you any longer.

Id: [0x00108A98]
No please...I...

Id: [0x00108A99]
Go ahead, tell me.

Id: [0x00108A9A]
My son...I think something happened to him

Id: [0x00108A9B]
He's a soldier, working in the village's fort. He was so proud to defend us.

Id: [0x00108A9C]
But lately, he was worried about something. A mother can see those kind of things.

Id: [0x00108A9D]
It's been 5 days now...he never came back from his last shift...

Id: [0x00108A9E]
I'll see if I can learn anything about him during my errand.

Id: [0x00108A9F]
Thank you traveller. 

Id: [0x00108AA0]
Yes? What is you want?

Id: [0x00108AA1]
You seem upset, can I help?

Id: [0x00108AA2]
I doubt it friend, I have an urgent delivery to make today but it seems my supplier is running late

Id: [0x00108AA3]
My cart is stacked up and ready to go near the granary but I’m missing a special wine request for the Magnate’s banquet.

Id: [0x00108AA4]
His arrival is a pretty big deal, heh?.

Id: [0x00108AA5]
Yes, we seldom host such events, the entire town is on the double. The Fort’s captain will have my guts if I don’t provide!

Id: [0x00108AA6]
Good luck!

Id: [0x00108AA7]
Ah! I was expecting discretion, but you my friend, you are a fucking ghost!

Id: [0x00108AA8]
Every one of those monsters will shit their pants thinking that they might be next.

Id: [0x00108AA9]
Fear will spread among their ranks.

Here's your money, and a little extra. You really impressed me!

Id: [0x00108AAB]
You know that when I told you "make it look inspired" I wasn't thinking about "make it look freakin' obvious"?

Id: [0x00108AAC]
Sorry. Unexpected stuff happened.

Id: [0x00108AAD]
Oh well...as long as the bastard's dead.

Id: [0x00108AAE]
Here's your reward. Obviously bare minimum. Maybe next time you'll do better.

Id: [0x00108AAF]
Oh excuse me, I did not see you there. How can I help?

Id: [0x00108AB0]
I’m of the Magnate’s entourage, I’ve just arrived today. Would you happen to know where they have quartered the rest of my group?

Id: [0x00108AB1]
Oh they’ve all been offered residence within the Fort’s wall; their exact location is unknown to me

Id: [0x00108AB2]
I see, thank you for your time.

Id: [0x00108AB3]
Pleasure

Id: [0x00108AB4]
Hi there good lad, I’m sorry to say that the shops closed today

Id: [0x00108AB5]
The Magnate’s entourage turned out to be twice the size we were expecting, the captain’s got us working double shift!

Id: [0x00108AB6]
This going to be quite the banquet heh?

Id: [0x00108AB7]
Quite a number to feed indeed and that’s just the half of it!

Id: [0x00108AB8]
The other group is already inside the main Keep, fixing up the Magnate’s private dinner.

Id: [0x00108AB9]
Well good luck to the lot of you.

Id: [0x00108ABA]
Much obliged

Id: [0x00108ABB]
Why the long face friend?

Id: [0x00108ABC]
They’ve cut me out, the bastards!

Id: [0x00108ABD]
Out of?

Id: [0x00108ABE]
I was assigned to the Magnate’s personal guard but turns out his lordship already had his own guards with him.

Id: [0x00108ABF]
So he’s strictly protected by outsiders?

Id: [0x00108AC0]
Yes, they even have their own little password to control the ins and outs; “From the heart of Wessex” … bunch of posers

Id: [0x00108AC1]
Pfff, I hear you.

Id: [0x00108AC2]
Yeah, I was really looking forward to the salary bump.

Id: [0x00108AC3]
Of all the years I’ve been stationed here, I’ve never once been locked out of the Keep

Id: [0x00108AC4]
Yea, talk about feeling underappreciated

Id: [0x00108AC5]
Yea, they have the Magnate protected up there like a king, as if one of us would just walk up there and kill him.

Id: [0x00108AC6]
Ridiculous.

Id: [0x00108AC7]
I hear you.

Id: [0x00108AC8]
The keep is off limit for the duration of the Truce signing, do you have the password soldier?

Id: [0x00108AC9]
Excuse me, I made a mistake.

Id: [0x00108ACA]
I will not warn you again, return to your post.

Id: [0x00108ACB]
I’m expected inside, I was on an errand. I bring urgent information.

Id: [0x00108ACC]
What's the password then?

Id: [0x00108ACD]
Glory to Saxon!

Id: [0x00108ACE]
Loyaulty to Wessex

Id: [0x00108ACF]
Let me enter mate...

Id: [0x00108AD0]
May our enemies feel our blades.

Id: [0x00108AD1]
What the hell is that...and you...wait!

Id: [0x00108AD2]
You're not one of us! GUARDS WITH ME!

Id: [0x00108AD3]
From the heart of Wessex.

Id: [0x00108AD4]
Very well, you may proceed Soldier. He's inside.

Id: [0x00108AD5]
Thank you sir.

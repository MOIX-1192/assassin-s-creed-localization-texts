Id: [0x000533AF]
God forsaken thugs!

Id: [0x000533B1]
You bastards!

Id: [0x000533B2]
It's not yours!

Id: [0x000541DA]
Are you alright?

Id: [0x000541DB]
I think so...didn't do much to me aside from a good scare. Blaggards.

Id: [0x000541DC]
What did they want with you?

Id: [0x000541DD]
My purse, which was meager, and they decided they'd punish me for their trouble.

Id: [0x000541DE]
Have you no home?

Id: [0x000541DF]
Ah, well. I was a proud resident of Boston until recently but I'm not a supporter of his majesty and well I was forced out of my wood shop and home by Loyalists.

Id: [0x000541E4]
There are plenty around here who could use the services of a skilled craftsman, if you were looking for somewhere to settle.

Id: [0x000541E7]
Is that right? I may look into that.

Id: [0x000541F5]
Animals! Stop!

Id: [0x000541F8]
Take what you deserve, rebel.

Id: [0x000541F9]
Please?! Stop!!

Id: [0x00054200]
Do gooder, eh?

Id: [0x00054202]
I'll gut you.

Id: [0x00054204]
Come on, louse!

Id: [0x0005420B]
Shut that whore up.

Id: [0x0005421A]
What happened?

Id: [0x0005421B]
They demanded we give our entire yield to the crown. Warren refused. They killed our animals, salted our earth then dragged us out. [beat]You saw what followed.

Id: [0x0005421E]
I'm afraid we have nothing to give you in thanks, stranger- we have nothing left.

Id: [0x00054221]
Perhaps there is something you could DO instead.

Id: [0x00054222]
Anything.

Id: [0x00054223]
I live in a small community not far from here. The soil is rich. The people I live with would have need of fresh vegetables, wheat or corn. If you were to rebuild your farm, you may prosper.

Id: [0x00054229]
What kindness is this? We'll certainly come see. Thank you.

Id: [0x0005423B]
Thank you Achilles.

Id: [0x0005423C]
You are most welcome.

Id: [0x0005423E]
Why did those men attack you?

Id: [0x0005423F]
It's no secret this land is full with game. I spotted the trespassers en route to request permission to hunt here myself and suggested they do the same.

Id: [0x00054247]
The bounty of the forest is not mine to give. It is your right to hunt on this land but I would appreciate you trading your surplus with the others.

Id: [0x0005424C]
Very well. I accept.

Id: [0x0005425E]
Thank you, my friend. They had a little too much bi√®re (beer) and didn't like the sound of my voice. I was only talking to that girl.

Id: [0x0005425F]
Your accent is unfamiliar. Where are you from?

Id: [0x00054260]
North of here. Province de (of) Quebec.

Id: [0x00054263]
And what brings you to Boston?

Id: [0x00054264]
I am a miner by trade but it's hard to find work. People don't listen to me because of my accent.

Id: [0x00054268]
It might be our meeting was fate. I hail from a village just a few miles north of here. There are the beginnings of a mine. I do not know what is in there but perhaps you might find what you are looking for within.

Id: [0x00054269]
I'll come have a look. If there's something good, maybe we'll talk.

Id: [0x00054270]
Hello, sir.

Id: [0x00054275]
We were passing through is all and met some of your townsfolk. They were thirsty and we had some barrels in the back and...

Id: [0x00054276]
We WERE inn keepers until the King took our inn for some military such-and-such and left us out on our round parts.

Id: [0x0005427C]
We certainly have a need for something of the sort. I will speak with my friends at the mill and see what we can do about building ourselves one. If it can be arranged, would you consider ending your search here?

Id: [0x00054286]
Of course, Ollie! We'll have an inn again!

Id: [0x000542AE]
You want to tell him, my love?

Id: [0x000542AF]
I'm pregnant!

Id: [0x000542B2]
Congratulations!

Id: [0x000542B5]
It's been a long time coming. It does present a slight problem, however. There's no doctor for miles.

Id: [0x000542C8]
Dr. White?

Id: [0x000542CB]
No. He's the drunken sot around the corner. If you can get his attention tell him I quit. All this ire on him. Not worth getting caught up in it. I have a family.

Id: [0x000542DB]
Good for nothing wench!

Id: [0x000542DD]
Let me go!

Id: [0x000542DE]
Shut up!

Id: [0x000542E5]
Leave.

Id: [0x000542E8]
That wasn't necessary.

Id: [0x000542ED]
I can handle myself. When he returns he'll try and give me twice the thrashing.

Id: [0x000542F0]
If I told you there was another place where you could live and work, free of him. Would you consider it?

Id: [0x000542F1]
The catch?

Id: [0x000542F2]
No catch, our village is growing and in need of all forms of trade.  Just business and a new life.

Id: [0x000542F3]
I'll come and see if what you say is true.

Id: [0x000542FD]
Rest assured I'm not the King's man.

Id: [0x00054302]
Welcome...minister?

Id: [0x00054307]
Hey! Connor! How 'bout a quick game of bowls?

Id: [0x00054309]
Connor! Fancy a bowl? No way you can take me.

Id: [0x0005430B]
You ever played bowls?

Id: [0x0005430F]
Ya see that, Connor?

Id: [0x00054311]
Oh! Now you're in trouble.

Id: [0x00054313]
Ha ha! The king strikes again.

Id: [0x00054315]
I'll give you that one.

Id: [0x00054317]
[Laughing]Spot of fortune, Connor.

Id: [0x00054319]
Blast! Come on. Get it together Terry!

Id: [0x0005431B]
Ohhh. Played before have we?

Id: [0x0005431D]
Not bad, not bad.

Id: [0x0005431F]
Looks like we have a match here.

Id: [0x00054321]
You'll have to do better than that, lad.

Id: [0x00054323]
Oooh. I almost feel guilty beating you.

Id: [0x00054325]
Are you TRYING to lose?

Id: [0x00054335]
Connor!

Id: [0x0005433D]
I don't mean to be a bother but I wanted to ask you something. When my cart went up in flames I lost most of my tools. I've got some spares back at my shop in Boston but as you know, I'm not really welcome around there. I thought- if it wasn't too much trouble- you could help me retrieve them?

Id: [0x0005436A]
Norris.

Id: [0x0005436B]
You know Myriam?

Id: [0x0005436C]
Of course.

Id: [0x0005436D]
What does she like? I want to give her a gift.

Id: [0x00054372]
I really do not know...

Id: [0x00054373]
Alright.

Id: [0x00054374]
Let me call on Prudence. She may be of service.

Id: [0x0005437A]
Prudence.

Id: [0x0005437B]
Good day Connor.

Id: [0x0005437C]
Norris is trying to- court...a woman. What do- you- women, like...in terms of gifts.

Id: [0x0005437D]
A nice bunch of wild flowers always brightens my day. Who is it Norris fancies?

Id: [0x0005437E]
Best not say for now.

Id: [0x00054381]
Fair enough. Best ones are atop the bluff to the North West. A bit tricky to get to but they grow large and healthy in the full sun.

Id: [0x00054385]
Prudence advised a bunch of wild flowers.

Id: [0x00054386]
Really? Are you sure? Doesn't seem right.

Id: [0x0005438F]
Bad news. She did not like the flowers. She tossed them aside.

Id: [0x00054390]
But Prudence was certain.

Id: [0x0005439F]
I will uncover this mystery myself, Norris.

Id: [0x000543A3]
She might appreciate a new knife. That blade has seen its prime.

Id: [0x000543B2]
Been fixin' to trap a cougar I've seen prowling about. The beast has snapped two of my snares already.

Id: [0x000543F0]
Allo. (hello)

Id: [0x000543F2]
I want to build her a new knife of steel I make special. I know where to get iron but the mine belongs to the English.

Id: [0x000543F3]
Will it take long to gather?

Id: [0x000543F4]
Non. (No.) A couple of blasts and I will have what I need. I just need you to stand watch. I will wait for you at the mine. It's not far, just off the property.

Id: [0x000543F9]
I need to prepare some explosive. My guess is the BANG will bring some unhappy English.

Id: [0x000543FB]
Got everything! Time to go!

Id: [0x0005440E]
Should I search for something to fill that space?

Id: [0x0005440F]
No rush. Eventually the right piece will present itself.

Id: [0x00054410]
As you wish.

Id: [0x00054411]
There's a chest in a cave on the edge of the property, could you retrieve it for me? I would go myself but these old bones prevent me from getting to it.

Id: [0x00054417]
I have what you asked for. [beat]But I must know- who put it there and for what purpose?

Id: [0x00054418]
I did. I put it somewhere I knew only I could reach, but that was a long time ago.

Id: [0x0005441A]
Who does THAT belong to?

Id: [0x0005441B]
These were the robes of the first Assassin to come to the colonies.

Id: [0x0005442E]
Good day Connor. I left some bolts of fine silk in my old home. They are very valuable but I don't think it wise I return there. Someone might wind up dead. I was hoping you could retrieve them for me if you had time.

Id: [0x00054484]
The steel Norris smelted is something else- I've rarely seen such fine metal. Trouble is my old tools aren't hard enough to work it. The ones I need aren't hard to find- a shop or two in New York sell them at a good price. I'd do it myself but with the Regulars after my head, I'll stay here safe and sound if I can.

Id: [0x00054489]
I have matters to attend to in New York. I will see to it the next time I journey there.

Id: [0x0005448A]
Sounds good!

Id: [0x00054491]
I have the tools you requested.

Id: [0x00054492]
Ah! Excellent! I'll get right to work. Norris has been hanging around pestering me about his knife.

Id: [0x00054497]
What do you think of our little plot of land, Doctor?

Id: [0x00054498]
It's quite beautiful. I'm grateful you found me. But to be truthful people outside our community still avoid me like the bloody plague. It baffled me for a time but then a courier delivered this to me.

Id: [0x0005449D]
We need you here. I will do what I can to end this defamation.

Id: [0x000544B8]
It is beautiful, old man.

Id: [0x000544B9]
It is. [pause]I've found a painting for the space above the mantel. It's being held in New York. If you get a moment, I'd like you to pick it up for me.

Id: [0x000544BA]
Certainly.

Id: [0x000544BE]
I have the painting you sent me for.

Id: [0x000544BF]
Maybe not just yet.

Id: [0x000544D9]
...they're coming David. We need to be ready.

Id: [0x000544DA]
Who is coming?

Id: [0x000544DB]
Redcoats. David's to be tried for treason. And executed more than likely.

Id: [0x000544E5]
David Walston. Turn yourself in and stand before a military tribunal on charges of treason and desertion.

Id: [0x000544E6]
I don't want any part of this war. Leave me be.

Id: [0x000544F8]
Come out here you lying trollop! I'll break this door down! I said come out and bring Maria while you're at it!

Id: [0x00054500]
Ellen and Maria are free of you. I say so. The people behind me say so. Believe me when I tell you if I EVER see you on this land again, I will end you.

Id: [0x00054501]
You can have them.

Id: [0x00054503]
Thank you. All of you. Nobody has ever stood up for us before.

Id: [0x00054504]
We protect our own, Ellen.

Id: [0x00054506]
This is my home, now. I'll find a way to show my gratitude to you all. I promise.

Id: [0x0005452E]
I am nervous.

Id: [0x0005452F]
I am certain she will love the blade you made for her.

Id: [0x00054530]
Arg. I made the stupid thing. I might as well give it to her.

Id: [0x00054534]
Allo, Myriam.

Id: [0x00054535]
Hello, Norris, hello Connor. I'd love to stay and chat but I promised Ellen a bale of furs this week and am not even close to making good. I need get out into the bush right away.

Id: [0x00054536]
I bring something for you. Maybe it will help.

Id: [0x00054538]
I really must get moving. I will thank you properly when I get back...until then. [kiss]

Id: [0x00054550]
There is nothing to fight about. I was here, nobody was hurt and the man will not be returning.

Id: [0x0005455B]
Connor! I simply can't get to all these men in reasonable time. I need help. From you. From anyone!

Id: [0x0005455E]
I think I have someone for you.

Id: [0x00054564]
Diana. Come with me. I need your help.

Id: [0x00054567]
Of course. What's the matter?

Id: [0x0005456F]
You did well, Connor. But Diana, you impressed me greatly.

Id: [0x00054573]
Might be Catherine could watch the young ones a few days a week.

Id: [0x00054574]
And if she can't, we'll find someone who will.

Id: [0x000545E8]
Old man.

Id: [0x000545EA]
Achilles.

Id: [0x000545EC]
Connor, if you are reading this, I have failed to say goodbye as I wanted, but the time never seemed appropriate. I leave this land and all its resources to you. I trust you now know this place has become something of great significance. A community to serve as an example of what this would-be-nation could become. But the larger and stronger it grows, the more fragile and difficult to defend it becomes. I hope your friends who are birthing this infant country understand this truth. Your unwavering tenacity and honesty have burdened you with responsibility far greater than any one man should bear. But you, if anyone, are capable. You have given an old man hope that all is not lost and for that I thank you. I ask that you lay my bones to rest on the hill overlooking the water, there is no other place on this earth I'd rather be. I am grateful to have met you, knowing you will guide this land and these people to a better future. Yours in brotherhood, Achilles.

Id: [0x000545F2]
[immediately sensing something is wrong]What is it?

Id: [0x000545F3]
Achilles has passed.

Id: [0x000545F4]
I'm so sorry.

Id: [0x000545F5]
He passed peacefully and with dignity.

Id: [0x000545F6]
A service then?

Id: [0x000545F7]
Yes. Please prepare something... appropriate. I will see the grave is dug. Can you gather everyone?

Id: [0x00054608]
Prayer and sermon do not suit this occasion. Achilles was not a man of God. Not my God, at any rate. But he certainly believed in a guiding force, and he is at peace now and for that we can be grateful. We lay him to rest here, atop the bluff where he made his honorable and dignified life, so he can remain that comforting presence- the old man on the hill- that we all have grown to depend on. You all had your own relationships with him, your own moments and I implore you to return here when the time is right for you and share those stories with the waves and the trees. Achilles. You will be missed but never forgotten. Go safely, old man, safely to where your soul need rest.

Id: [0x0005460A]
I will make you proud old man.

Id: [0x00054612]
What is it?

Id: [0x00054613]
An...asset.

Id: [0x00054617]
Come dear Amanda, quit the town. Come, dear A-man--da, quit the town. Come, dear A-man--da, quit the town and to the ru--ral hamlets fly; Behold the wint'ry storms are gone. Behold the wint'ry storms are gone. Behold the wint'ry storms are gone and a gentle radiance glads the sky...

Id: [0x00054619]
Said 'go way', boy. D'ya not speak the King's English?

Id: [0x0005461B]
Oh, I didn't see you there, old man. I'd of set my home in order if I'd known you'd be callin'.

Id: [0x0005461D]
The boy's name is Connor. He's here to restore the property.

Id: [0x0005461F]
Restore?...RESTORE! Pardon my manners!

Id: [0x00054621]
She's still the fastest in the Atlantic- sure she needs some attention...minor things mostly, but with a little affection she'll fly again.

Id: [0x00054622]
Who is 'she'?

Id: [0x00054623]
WHO is SHE? Why the Aquila, boy! The Ghost of the North Seas!

Id: [0x00054624]
The boat.

Id: [0x00054625]
b-b...a BOAT?! She's a SHIP, boy, and make no mistake about it! [to Achilles]I thought you brought him here to restore order! I reckon he's the greenest thing on the frontier!

Id: [0x00054626]
Connor, meet me back at the manor when you've finished here.

Id: [0x00054628]
You said it requires repairs.. You able?

Id: [0x00054629]
SHE does need work- a ship is a 'she', boy- and yes I can refit her but I'm lacking in the proper supplies. Some.. Some quality timber would help me get started.

Id: [0x0005462C]
I can see to that. How long before it- SHE is able to sail again?

Id: [0x0005462D]
Just get me the lumber, boy and I'll raise a crew.

Id: [0x00054643]
She is... solid.

Id: [0x00054644]
Aye. Weatherly and sleek. She'll fetch 12 knots in a stiff gale, ne'er a ship from here to Singapore can outrun her on her best day.

Id: [0x00054646]
Wha'dya say we take her out and show you what she can do first hand.

Id: [0x00054654]
Take the helm.

Id: [0x00054659]
Come on, lad! No time like the present!

Id: [0x0005465B]
Come on, come on! She won't bite!

Id: [0x0005465D]
Double time, boy! It's time you learnt!

Id: [0x0005465F]
She's a nimble vessel but the faster she goes the more cumbersome she grows and the firmer your hand needs to be.

Id: [0x00054676]
Careful Connor! I'm not ready for Fiddler's Green just yet!

Id: [0x00054678]
Treat her like a boulder and she'll sink like a stone!

Id: [0x0005467A]
Keep her off the reef!

Id: [0x00054703]
Come aboard and feast your eyes, boy!

Id: [0x0005470E]
Master Connor! Master Connor! Dad and Godfrey are fighting! You need to stop it!

Id: [0x00054715]
Norris. I am going to fetch something for the old man and he told me there might be some stone that requires clearing.

Id: [0x00054716]
Yah? I will bring my explosifs (explosives).

Id: [0x00054719]
I see why he encouraged me to enlist your services.

Id: [0x0005471A]
Pas de probl√®me. (No problem.) We blow it up.

Id: [0x0005471C]
Duck and cover.

Id: [0x0005471F]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00054720]
Bienvenue. (You're welcome.)

Id: [0x0005472E]
I found your bolts.

Id: [0x0005472F]
Wonderful! I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

Id: [0x00054730]
Your husband was there, speaking ill of you. He ran off when he saw me.

Id: [0x00054731]
Oh my. That dirty rotten bastard of man would do something like that. At least you were able to come away with the only thing of value that remained there. Thank you Connor.

Id: [0x0005476F]
Take Norris with you; the cave entrance is blocked with heavy stone and will need to be cleared one way or another.

Id: [0x00054906]
"It lies under the eagle's bed,"

Id: [0x00054909]
Who would ever attack this fort, I ask you? Nobody. No reason to. They sent us here cause the captain did something wrong.

Id: [0x0005490A]
Like what?

Id: [0x0005490B]
Buggered if I know.

Id: [0x00054920]
Be my guest.

Id: [0x00054938]
Be gone with you!

Id: [0x0005493A]
She's not your daughter anymore you lummox!

Id: [0x0005493C]
You are incapable of caring for my sweet girl! Just leave us! Brute!

Id: [0x0005496D]
Stop!

Id: [0x0005496F]
Leave me be! I found it!

Id: [0x00054971]
It's not yours! Leave me alone!

Id: [0x00054973]
Why are you chasing me! I've done nothing wrong!

Id: [0x0005498B]
"Near the wolf's abode."

Id: [0x000549BE]
I'm a little on edge, captain. The prospect of Captain Kidd's treasure and the mysteries that lie with it have me a trifle spooked.

Id: [0x000549BF]
Stay your anxiety, it is likely only treasure.

Id: [0x000549C6]
Oi! You, yes, you like to swing your mitts, eh? Down to the... uh, the warehouse's a place men of your kind be meetin'.

Id: [0x000549C8]
You want something of a real challenge I'd proffer you making your way to the warehouse, mate. Real brawlers down there.

Id: [0x000549CA]
Have you been down to the warehouse? That's the place scrappers go to do the fighting thing with.. with others of the sort.

Id: [0x000549D3]
Think you're meaner than goose grease, do you? I'm organizing a tourney for lads like you. But it's not open to just anyone. Gotta prove yourself first. Here's a list of names. Beat each of these brutes and you'll get your spot. Then we'll see how tough you really are.

Id: [0x000549DA]
I wager he buggered something...

Id: [0x000549DC]
No boots have trod this deck in ages.

Id: [0x00054C71]
There we was, eight months in the Kentucky frontier trappin' and skinnin' elk- well along my third bale- when they came upon us. No less than a dozen Shawnee hunters had us surrounded at the point of musket and arrow. My bush partner froze up stiff. [a beat]The fear chilled me the same but I managed to muster what little Shawnee I was knowin'.

Id: [0x00054C74]
William Johnson is dead - and with him, the Templar plot to steal the land of my people. But in ending this threat, I have revealed another. On his body was a letter addressed to John Pitcairn, containing orders to root out and destroy Patriot weapons and supplies. Should he succeed in this, the colonists will be unable to maintain their resistance and the Templars will surely take control. So long as Pitcairn lives, the danger remains. I need to find him. He needs to die.

Id: [0x00054C7B]
Seems we've company.

Id: [0x00054CBD]
Ah, Connor. What a relief! You came! Allow me to...  to introduce you to William Dawes and Robert Newman.

Id: [0x00054CD0]
Indeed, you and I will cross the Charles river and rouse the boys.

Id: [0x00054CD2]
No time for dawdling, my friend! We have lives to save. Come on!

Id: [0x00054CFC]
Ah. They've only left a single horse. We'll have to ride together.

Id: [0x00054CFE]
Ah, you take the reins. I'll navigate.

Id: [0x00054D02]
I'll guide you towards those we need to alert! Follow my directions and we'll be done in no time!

Id: [0x00054D05]
Go left up here.

Id: [0x00054D07]
To the left Connor.

Id: [0x00054D09]
Go right, Connor.

Id: [0x00054D0B]
To the right, Connor, to the right!

Id: [0x00054D10]
We are close!

Id: [0x00054D12]
Almost there, Connor.

Id: [0x00054D14]
Yes! This is it! This is the way!

Id: [0x00054D16]
I believe we are on course.

Id: [0x00054D18]
Excellent! We are almost there!

Id: [0x00054D1A]
This way, Connor.

Id: [0x00054D1C]
Keep going.

Id: [0x00054D1E]
Hmmm. This is not right...

Id: [0x00054D20]
We've gotten lost somehow.

Id: [0x00054D22]
None of this looks familiar.

Id: [0x00054D24]
Something is wrong... We are off course.

Id: [0x00054D26]
Where are we? This is all wrong...

Id: [0x00054D28]
Wrong way, Connor.

Id: [0x00054D2A]
Oh bother. Everything looks the same at night...

Id: [0x00054D2C]
I have made this crossing a dozen times - why is everything suddenly so foreign? Pressure must be getting to me.

Id: [0x00054D2E]
Does any of this look familiar to you, Connor?

Id: [0x00054D30]
Give me a moment and I will get my bearings.

Id: [0x00054D36]
Let everyone know that the Regulars march for Lexington and Concord.

Id: [0x00054D3A]
Ready yourselves. The enemy approaches.

Id: [0x00054D3D]
Where the devil is he?

Id: [0x00054D3E]
Are you sure we are in the right place?

Id: [0x00054D3F]
Sure I'm sure!

Id: [0x00054D41]
Prescott?

Id: [0x00054D43]
Evening, gents.

Id: [0x00054D46]
Listen, the Regulars are out. You need to rally your men... And put on some trousers!

Id: [0x00054D48]
At once.

Id: [0x00054D4D]
Welcome to Lexington, Connor. [a beat]Now let's find Hancock and Adams.

Id: [0x00054D52]
Hmmm. No sign of Dawes. I hope he's alright.

Id: [0x00054D57]
Paul. Connor. Good to see you.

Id: [0x00054D59]
You need to leave. The Redcoats are coming.

Id: [0x00054D5A]
Aye, so William's told us. Let them conduct their little search. They'll find nothing.

Id: [0x00054D5B]
You don't understand..

Id: [0x00054D5D]
I'm afraid it's true.

Id: [0x00054D5F]
I suppose we have no choice then, but to go. What of you three?

Id: [0x00054D60]
Dawes and I will continue on to Concord. Connor, it's best you stay here and help our man John Parker hold the town. It'll give us time to spread the word.

Id: [0x00054D6E]
Stand your ground, men! Don't fire unless fired upon! [a beat]But if they mean to have a war, let it begin here!

Id: [0x00054D70]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x00054D72]
Pitcairn.

Id: [0x00054D75]
Disperse, you damned rebels! Lay down your arms and disperse!

Id: [0x00054D77]
What the deuce are you doing?! Hold your positions!

Id: [0x00054D79]
Cravens! Traitors!

Id: [0x00054D7A]
They are not coming back. You will have to make do with those who remain.

Id: [0x00054D7B]
Don't you lecture me on how -

Id: [0x00054D7D]
Return fire! Return fire!

Id: [0x00054DA3]
Show this to whoever leads there. Should be a man by the name of James Barrett.

Id: [0x00054DAD]
Wait!

Id: [0x00054DB5]
Blood's been spilled in Lexington, and there's more to come. The Regulars are on the march.

Id: [0x00054DB6]
You don't say? Why do you think I've men up here?

Id: [0x00054DB8]
Go home, 'fore you get yourself killed. I've enough to worry about without some green boy looking to play at hero.

Id: [0x00054DBD]
Sir!

Id: [0x00054DC1]
Man the barricades!

Id: [0x00054DC3]
MAN THE BARRICADES! [a beat]No. Ensure my men hold those positions! If the Red Devils break through, we're finished!

Id: [0x00054DC4]
What would you have me do?

Id: [0x00054DC5]
Listen carefully. The Redcoats will form firing lines. Order the men to shoot just before the line is ready. Too soon and they'll miss their targets. Too late and the enemy will open fire first.

Id: [0x00054DC6]
Understood.

Id: [0x00054DC7]
And if any of those bastards make it through, engage them. You must keep my men alive!

Id: [0x00054DCD]
Fire!

Id: [0x00054DCF]
Fire now!

Id: [0x00054DD1]
Open fire!

Id: [0x00054DD3]
Shoot!

Id: [0x00054DD5]
Go!

Id: [0x00054DD7]
They've broken through!

Id: [0x00054DD9]
Redcoats!

Id: [0x00054DDB]
Help me!

Id: [0x00054DDD]
Over here! Help!

Id: [0x00054DDF]
They've breached the barricade!

Id: [0x00054DE4]
We did it! They're turning tail!

Id: [0x00054DFA]
...and for the support of the glorious cause. I beg they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their approbation.

Id: [0x00054DFC]
But, lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavourable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered, by every Gentleman in the room, that I, this day, declare with utmost sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the Command I am honored with. As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to assure the Congress, that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to have accepted this arduous employment, at the expence of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit from it.  I will keep an exact Account of my expences.  Those, I doubt not, they will discharge, and that is all I desire.‚Äù

Id: [0x00054DFE]
Truly, there is no man better suited to the task.

Id: [0x00054E00]
Really? I can think of several.

Id: [0x00054E02]
Charles Lee.

Id: [0x00054E04]
Do I know you?

Id: [0x00054E06]
I would not expect you to remember.

Id: [0x00054E0A]
Come Connor - there's someone I want you to meet.

Id: [0x00054E0D]
Sorry to pull you away like that, but the last thing we need is the two of you coming to blows.

Id: [0x00054E0F]
Connor, allow me to introduce you to our newly appointed Commander-in-Chief, George Washington.

Id: [0x00054E11]
Ah! So you're the one who saved Sam and John at Lexington.

Id: [0x00054E12]
It was the Patriots who did that. I merely lent support.

Id: [0x00054E14]
As humble as he is brave. We could use more men like you.

Id: [0x00054E16]
I'm sorry, but if you'll excuse me - I should attend to Charles over there. He looks none too happy about being passed over for command.

Id: [0x00054E18]
It was good to meet you Connor.

Id: [0x00054E1A]
Tell me you have news of Pitcairn.

Id: [0x00054E1C]
I'm told he's taken shelter in Boston, where he's guarded by a thousand Redcoats. The only way you're going to get at him, is if we draw him out. Lucky for you, we're launching an offensive against the city in order to do just that.

Id: [0x00054E1E]
Israel Putnam has been given command of our forces. Present this to him and he'll provide whatever aid you require. You'll find him at the encampment on Bunker Hill.

Id: [0x00054E1F]
You have my thanks.

Id: [0x00054E20]
No need. It's the least I could do. Pitcairn's a dangerous man. The sooner we're rid of him, the better.

Id: [0x00054E21]
I would say the same of Charles Lee.

Id: [0x00054E23]
Now that's an altogether different beast. Let us leave it for another day. Best you head to Boston, Connor.

Id: [0x00054E2E]
Hold and state your business!

Id: [0x00054E30]
I'm looking for Israel Putnam.

Id: [0x00054E32]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00054E36]
This is not Bunker Hill.

Id: [0x00054E37]
Aye. It's Breed's. There's been some... disagreement as to where we should encamp.

Id: [0x00054E38]
Any news from Boston?

Id: [0x00054E39]
The Tories aren't moving. And anytime we try to press them, we lose a dozen men. I think Putnam and the others plan to assemble artillery on these hills. A good shelling might make the Redcoats rethink their strategy.

Id: [0x00054E3A]
And what of John Pitcairn?

Id: [0x00054E3B]
That bastard is the cagiest of the bunch. He's appeared, time to time, to taunt us or send regards by way of cannon fire. It's all right, though. He'll have what's coming to him soon enough.

Id: [0x00054E40]
Putnam's just up ahead. You can't miss him.

Id: [0x00054E44]
I don't care much for your excuses, gentlemen. We should be building on Bunker Hill. Breed's is closer to the city, but it is also closer to their artillery!

Id: [0x00054E45]
Our orders came from men so divorced from the situation, we are compelled by reason to employ our own faculties to make a proper determination.

Id: [0x00054E47]
Were that I could understand even HALF that nonsense you just uttered...

Id: [0x00054E48]
What's not to understand?! I'm trying to ensure our victory!

Id: [0x00054E4A]
What would you know about victory? I killed a she-wolf in her den armed with only a knife. I escaped the Caughnawaga Indians, who sought to burn me alive. And I was the sole survivor of a shipwreck during the Battle of Havana. So you will excuse me if I choose not to follow your advice.

Id: [0x00054E50]
I rest my case.

Id: [0x00054E52]
I'm going back to Bunker Hill. Good-day, gentlemen.

Id: [0x00054E54]
General Putnam?

Id: [0x00054E55]
What?

Id: [0x00054E56]
I'm looking for John Pitcairn. I was told you'd be able to help me find him.

Id: [0x00054E58]
He's tucked away inside the city with no reason to leave. So long as that ship continues its assault, we'll never flush him out.

Id: [0x00054E5B]
But if the ship was silenced...

Id: [0x00054E5C]
...Then poor John might be forced to get off his arse and come forward!

Id: [0x00054E5E]
I shall fly this flag to signal my success.

Id: [0x00054E60]
And I shall speak fondly of you at your funeral.

Id: [0x00054E74]
The enemy advances and you tremble. They've better numbers, you say. Better weapons. Better training. But I do not fear, and neither should you. For what they have in material, they lack in conviction and care. But not us. We have discipline. We have order. And most importantly, we have passion. We believe! So maintain vigilance. Conserve your ammo. Ensure a proper line of sight. And above all else, men: do not fire until you see the whites of their eyes.

Id: [0x00054E78]
Well I'll be damned [laugh]you did it.

Id: [0x00054E79]
That was quite a speech.

Id: [0x00054E7A]
Lies, all of it, I'm afraid. Still, such words have carried us thus far...

Id: [0x00054E7C]
And what of Pitcairn?

Id: [0x00054E81]
He's left Boston as I said he would, and set up camp on Moulton Hill.

Id: [0x00054E85]
There's no good way to get at him - not with that maelstrom brewing down below. I suppose you could circle around a bit, or wait for us to thin their ranks.

Id: [0x00054E89]
There is no time. I will have to chance direct approach.

Id: [0x00054E8A]
That's twice today you've proposed the impossible!

Id: [0x00054E8B]
I see no other choice.

Id: [0x00054E8D]
That's cos you're mad as a march hare, son.

Id: [0x00054E8F]
I expect an apology on my return.

Id: [0x00054E9B]
Men.

Id: [0x00054E9D]
It seems we are well and truly at war... [a moment]A pity, that. For it's a war we did not ask for. A war we did not wish... And why would we? We're killing our brothers down there - and for what? Duty? Honor? Liberty and justice as the Yanks claim? No. They fight for privilege. They fight for power. And not for themselves, but for their masters back in Philadelphia. [a sigh]Blindly they believe WE are the enemy. We who nurtured and sheltered them. Who brought order and civilization to this once feral land. [a moment as he looks over the men]Blood will be spilled today - theirs and ours - though, I pray, not in equal measure... But the die has been cast. And so we must press on. I only hope this madness is soon ended.

Id: [0x00054EA0]
Clinton. Pigot. To me. We must ready the next offensive.

Id: [0x00054EA5]
Why... Why did you do this?

Id: [0x00054EA6]
To protect Adams and Hancock - and those they serve. You meant to kill them -

Id: [0x00054EA7]
Kill them? Are you mad? I wanted only to parlay. There was so much to discuss. To explain...

Id: [0x00054EA9]
But you've put an end to that now.

Id: [0x00054EAB]
If you speak true, then I will carry your last words to them.

Id: [0x00054EAC]
They must lay down their arms. They must stop this war!

Id: [0x00054EAD]
Why them and not the Redcoats?

Id: [0x00054EAE]
Do you not think we asked the same question of the British? These things take time. And it would have succeeded, had you let me play my part...

Id: [0x00054EAF]
The part of the puppeteer.

Id: [0x00054EB0]
Better we hold the strings than another.

Id: [0x00054EB1]
No. The strings should be severed. All should be free.

Id: [0x00054EB2]
And we should live forever on castles in the sky. You wield your blade like a man, but your mouth like a child. And more will die now because of that...

Id: [0x00054EBC]
General Putnam.

Id: [0x00054EBD]
You live!

Id: [0x00054EBE]
The same cannot be said for Pitcairn.

Id: [0x00054EBF]
Well done, I suppose. But it matters little now. I'm ordering a full retreat. We have lost too many in exchange for too little. If the Tories want this hill so badly, let them have it. Boston is the true prize.

Id: [0x00054EC0]
We have a bigger problem.

Id: [0x00054EC1]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00054EC3]
This can't be right. It says they plan to murder Washington!

Id: [0x00054EC9]
Looks like we have a guest. We got camps like this spread across the puckerbrush- good places to rest up safe when you been out a long turn. But you need to show you've legged enough bush to share a fire with us.

Id: [0x00054ECE]
What story you tellin'?

Id: [0x00054ECF]
I happened across an encampment belonging to two of your friends a few leagues from here. The scene was grisly. My thoughts were of highwaymen or war parties. But as soon as I searched the area the truth of their fates came clear. Somewhere along their journey your friends found this.

Id: [0x00054ED2]
No easy story to tell. I give you thanks on behalf of the New England Adventurer's Society for allowin' us closure on the matter. Feel free to warm your hands on any of our fires. Welcome to the Adventurers.

Id: [0x00054F72]
Mister mister! My mother needs help! Please!? Please help her!

Id: [0x00054F74]
Where is your mother?

Id: [0x00054F75]
Follow me!

Id: [0x00054F7D]
And stay away from my daughter!

Id: [0x00054F7F]
Why would you stay with such a man?

Id: [0x00054F80]
This is my house and business! It's my tailoring that paid for this place. I'll take his drunken buffoonery over leaving behind what I built.

Id: [0x00054F82]
Please! Help me!

Id: [0x00054F84]
I'm begging you to help me! Why won't you listen?!

Id: [0x00054F86]
Help me! Help! Help me please!

Id: [0x00054F8C]
Found it.

Id: [0x00054F8E]
I'll gut you!

Id: [0x00054F90]
If you come near her I'll tear you apart!

Id: [0x00054F92]
You'll regret this!

Id: [0x00054FC6]
Connor!

Id: [0x00054FC8]
You have a minute my friend?

Id: [0x00054FF5]
Form ranks!

Id: [0x00054FF6]
Present arms!

Id: [0x00055001]
I'll stay with our ride, captain, make sure nothing happens to it.

Id: [0x00055019]
How dare you sneak up on me like that! Why don‚Äôt you just go off there and just help this camp retreat! Don‚Äôt ever do that again you hear me! God Damn‚Äôit.

Id: [0x0005502A]
Through all the Employments of Life<br> / Each Neighbour abuses his Brother /<br>Whore and Rogue they call Husband and Wife / All Professions be-rogue one another / The Priest calls the Lawyer a Cheat / The Lawyer be-knaves the Divine / And the Statesman, because he's so great / Thinks his Trade as honest as mine.

Id: [0x0005503F]
Haytham...

Id: [0x00055042]
You should have come to me. We would have found another way...

Id: [0x00055043]
Yes. But then you would have known.

Id: [0x00055045]
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00055046]
As am I.

Id: [0x0005504C]
[Annoyed huff]

Id: [0x00055052]
[SCREAM]

Id: [0x00055055]
Somebody please! Help!

Id: [0x0005505C]
Order! We must have order!

Id: [0x0005505D]
Peace, friends! There is no danger!

Id: [0x0005506A]
Rather dull, truth be told.

Id: [0x0005506C]
Aye. To Fleet and Bride.

Id: [0x0005506D]
By your command.

Id: [0x0005507B]
Fascinating...

Id: [0x0005507F]
Gentlemen. I hold in my hand a key. And if this book is to be believed, it will open the doors of a storehouse built by Those Who Came Before.

Id: [0x00055080]
Ah.. Yes, those who ruled, reigned, and then vanished from the world. Do we know what it is that would be held within?

Id: [0x00055082]
It could contain certain knowledge. Perhaps a weapon. Or something as yet unknown, unfathomable in its construction and purpose. It could be any of these things. Or none of them.

Id: [0x00055084]
They are still an enigma, these precursors. But of one thing I am certain - whatever waits behind those doors shall prove a great boon to us all.

Id: [0x00055085]
Or our enemies. Should they find it first.

Id: [0x00055087]
They won't. You've seen to that.

Id: [0x00055088]
I assume you know where this storehouse is?

Id: [0x0005508A]
Ah, Mister Harrison.

Id: [0x0005508C]
Gentlemen.

Id: [0x0005508D]
How fare your calculations?

Id: [0x00055090]
I believe the site lies somewhere within this region.

Id: [0x00055091]
That's a lot of ground to cover.

Id: [0x00055092]
My apologies. Were that I could be more accurate...

Id: [0x00055093]
That's alright. It suffices for a start.

Id: [0x00055095]
And this is why we've called you here, Master Kenway. We'd like for you to travel to America, locate the storehouse, and take possession of its contents.

Id: [0x00055096]
I am yours to command. [a pause]Although a job of this magnitude will require more than just myself.

Id: [0x00055097]
Of course.

Id: [0x00055099]
Upon this paper are the names of five men sympathetic to our cause. Each is also uniquely suited to aid you in your endeavor. With them at your side, you will want for nothing.

Id: [0x0005509B]
Well, then I'd best be on my way.

Id: [0x0005509D]
I knew our faith in you was not misplaced. We've booked you passage to Boston. Your ship leaves at dawn.

Id: [0x000550A0]
Go forth, Haytham - and bring honor to us all.

Id: [0x000550C9]
Master Kenway! Master Kenway!

Id: [0x000550CB]
Yes? May I help you?

Id: [0x000550CD]
Charles Lee, sir. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. I've been asked to introduce you to the city. Help you settle in.

Id: [0x000550CF]
Oh no need sir. I've arranged for your bags to be delivered to the inn.

Id: [0x000550D3]
Are you by any chance John and Isabella's son?

Id: [0x000550D4]
One and the same.

Id: [0x000550D5]
Your commission is with Edward Braddock, is it not?

Id: [0x000550D6]
Aye. But he's yet to reach America and I figured I might... Well... At least until he arrives... I thought...

Id: [0x000550D7]
Yes. Out with it.

Id: [0x000550D8]
Forgive me, sir. I had... I had hoped that I might study under you. If I am to serve the Order, I can imagine no better mentor than yourself.

Id: [0x000550DA]
Kind of you to say, but I think you overestimate me.

Id: [0x000550DB]
Impossible, sir.

Id: [0x000550DD]
This way.

Id: [0x000550EC]
Over here.

Id: [0x000550EE]
We ride for the Green Dragon Tavern. The proprietors are... eccentric, but the rooms are spacious and they do not pry.

Id: [0x000550F2]
Have you been told why it is I've come to Boston?

Id: [0x000550F3]
No. Master Birch said I should know only as much as you saw fit to share. He sent me a list of names and bade me ensure you could find them.

Id: [0x000550F4]
And have you had any luck with that?

Id: [0x000550F5]
Aye. William Johnson waits for us at the Green Dragon.

Id: [0x000550F6]
How well do you know him?

Id: [0x000550F7]
Not well. But he saw the Order's mark and did not hesitate to come.

Id: [0x000550F8]
Prove yourself loyal to our cause and you may yet know our plans as well.

Id: [0x000550F9]
I should like nothing more, sir.

Id: [0x000550FD]
You lying, cheating, no-good sonofabitch!

Id: [0x00055103]
Perhaps we've come at a bad time?

Id: [0x00055105]
Oh! Don't be foolish, dearies! Please. Sit. Fancy something to eat? A drink, perhaps? Or is it a bed you require?

Id: [0x00055107]
We've already let rooms here.

Id: [0x00055109]
Oh, yes! Of course! Masters Lee and Kenway, was it? I'll have your bags brought up.

Id: [0x00055111]
Do you require anything further?

Id: [0x00055112]
Only privacy.

Id: [0x00055114]
This way.

Id: [0x0005511A]
Sir. William Johnson.

Id: [0x0005511C]
A pleasure.

Id: [0x0005511E]
A good lad, if a bit earnest.

Id: [0x00055120]
I'm told you're putting together an expedition.

Id: [0x00055121]
We believe there's a precursor site in the region. I require your knowledge of the land and its people to find it.

Id: [0x00055122]
Sadly, my research has been stolen. Without it, I'm of no use to you.

Id: [0x00055123]
Then we'll find it. Do you have any leads?

Id: [0x00055124]
My associate, Thomas Hickey, has been making the rounds. He's quite good at loosening tongues.

Id: [0x00055125]
Well tell me where I can find him. I'll see if I can't speed things up.

Id: [0x00055126]
We've heard rumors of bandits operating from a compound southwest of here. You'll likely find him there.

Id: [0x00055128]
Charles.

Id: [0x0005512A]
Sir?

Id: [0x0005512B]
We'd best be off.

Id: [0x00055131]
Thomas Hickey?

Id: [0x00055132]
Who's askin'?

Id: [0x00055133]
Haytham Kenway.

Id: [0x00055135]
Is that s'pposed to mean somethin'?

Id: [0x00055137]
Show some respect, boy.

Id: [0x00055139]
Peace, Charles.

Id: [0x0005513B]
William Johnson sent us in the hopes we might... expedite your search.

Id: [0x0005513C]
Don't need no expidittin' - don't need none of your fancy London-speak, neither. I've found the men done the theft.

Id: [0x0005513D]
Then why are you just lazing around?

Id: [0x0005513F]
Figgerin' out how to deal wit those varlets.

Id: [0x0005514D]
[whistle]Bet this'll fetch a pretty penny...

Id: [0x0005514E]
Save your looting for AFTER we've found Johnson's research.

Id: [0x0005514F]
Yes master.

Id: [0x00055151]
We're lookin for a chest...

Id: [0x00055159]
Lay down your weapons and I'll consider letting you live.

Id: [0x0005515A]
I make you the same offer.

Id: [0x0005515C]
We've no quarrel. I only wish to return this chest to its rightful owner.

Id: [0x0005515D]
Nothing rightful about Mister Johnson.

Id: [0x0005515E]
I won't ask again.

Id: [0x0005515F]
Agreed.

Id: [0x00055168]
Your kind has no need for books and maps. Who put you up to this?

Id: [0x0005516A]
Never seen a person. It's always been dead drops and letters. But they always pay, so we do the jobs.

Id: [0x0005516B]
Well those days are done. Tell your masters I said as much.

Id: [0x0005516C]
[effort]Who should I say you are?

Id: [0x0005516D]
You don't. They'll know.

Id: [0x00055171]
A shame so many had to die.

Id: [0x00055172]
Aye. Terrible tragedy, that.

Id: [0x00055176]
Careful, gents! We've company.

Id: [0x00055178]
Don't let go of the chest, Charles! We'll take care of this rabble.

Id: [0x0005517C]
There you are.

Id: [0x0005517D]
My thanks, Master Kenway. Now tell me what it is you need.

Id: [0x0005517F]
The images on this amulet - are they familiar to you? Perhaps one of the tribes has shown you something similar?

Id: [0x00055181]
It appears Kanien'keh√°:ka in origin.

Id: [0x00055182]
Can you trace it to a specific location? I need to know where it came from.

Id: [0x00055183]
With my research returned, perhaps. Let me see what I can do.

Id: [0x00055185]
Thomas?

Id: [0x00055186]
Wot?

Id: [0x00055188]
Rent yourself a room. [pauses, wrinkles his nose, frowns]And a bath as well... I suspect we'll be here for awhile.

Id: [0x0005518F]
Evening, gentlemen.

Id: [0x00055191]
[burps]

Id: [0x00055192]
Charming.

Id: [0x00055197]
Oi, Catherine ya fussock! Git back here! Daddy needs a drink!

Id: [0x00055199]
Ohh peace, Charles! He'll grow on you.

Id: [0x0005519C]
How fares the search?

Id: [0x0005519E]
Maths and maps are not cutting it.

Id: [0x0005519F]
What of your local contacts?

Id: [0x000551A0]
We'll need to earn their trust before they'll share what they know.

Id: [0x000551A2]
[small cough]I've an idea on how we might be effectin' that.

Id: [0x000551A4]
There's a man who's taken to enslavin' natives. Rescue 'em and they'll owe us.

Id: [0x000551A5]
Do you know where they're being held?

Id: [0x000551A6]
'Fraid not.

Id: [0x000551A7]
Benjamin Church will. He's a finder and a fixer.

Id: [0x000551AB]
He's also on your list.

Id: [0x000551AD]
And there I was, wondering whom I might solicit next. Well done.

Id: [0x000551B2]
Wonderful.

Id: [0x000551B4]
Charles!

Id: [0x000551B8]
Seems like we're not the only ones looking for Mister Church.

Id: [0x000551B9]
Dammit! He could be anywhere. What do we do?

Id: [0x000551BA]
We find him.

Id: [0x000551BE]
Start questioning those on the street. I'm headed for higher ground...

Id: [0x000551CF]
...and so he says to Church, that one way or another the debt would be settled. I don't envy the man. He's grim times ahead.

Id: [0x000551D0]
Wot ya think they planning?

Id: [0x000551D1]
All I know is it can't be good. Cutter was with 'em.

Id: [0x000551D9]
Why must you always make these things so difficult, Benjamin? Merely provide me with recompense and all shall be forgiven.

Id: [0x000551DA]
I'll not pay for protection I don't need!

Id: [0x000551DC]
Clearly, you DO require protection, else we wouldn't be here.

Id: [0x000551DE]
How very gauche.

Id: [0x000551E2]
Now, what shall we do about our guest?

Id: [0x000551E3]
Maybe I take 'is hands. Put an end to 'is surgerin'. Maybe I take 'is tongue. Put an end to 'is wagglin'. Or maybe I take 'is cock. Put an end to 'is fuckin' us!

Id: [0x000551E5]
So many options. I can't possibly decide. [a pause, then a dismissive wave]Take all three.

Id: [0x000551E6]
Now hold a moment. Perhaps I was hasty in refusing you earlier...

Id: [0x000551E8]
I'm so very sorry, Benjamin, but that door has closed.

Id: [0x000551E9]
Be reasonable, Silas.

Id: [0x000551EA]
I rather think I was. But you took advantage of my generosity. I won't be made a fool a second time.

Id: [0x000551ED]
[Sigh]I fear I lack the constitution to bear witness to such barbarism. Come find me when you're finished, Cutter.

Id: [0x000551EF]
You'll regret this, Silas! Do you hear me?! I'll have your head!

Id: [0x000551F1]
No, I rather think you won't.

Id: [0x000551F5]
Who... Who are you?

Id: [0x000551F7]
Haytham Kenway, at your service.

Id: [0x000551F8]
I... I don't understand... Why are you here?

Id: [0x000551F9]
Walk with me, Mister Church, and all will be explained.

Id: [0x000551FF]
Johnson's told me what you intend. As it happens, the man who held me is the same one that you seek. His name is Silas Thatcher.

Id: [0x00055200]
That fancy lad is our slaver?

Id: [0x00055201]
Don't let his velvet tongue deceive you. A crueler and more vicious creature, I've never known.

Id: [0x00055202]
What can you tell me of his operation?

Id: [0x00055203]
He hosts at least a hundred men, more than half of whom are Redcoats.

Id: [0x00055204]
All this for some slaves?

Id: [0x00055206]
Hardly. The man's a commander in the King's Troop, in charge of the Southgate Fort.

Id: [0x0005520A]
We need to find a way inside... Hmmm... Let me think on it. In the meantime, I'll attend to our final recruit.

Id: [0x00055210]
John Pitcairn's our man. I'll take you to him.

Id: [0x00055214]
State your business.

Id: [0x00055217]
New recruit.

Id: [0x0005521A]
More kindling for the pyre, eh? Go on, then.

Id: [0x0005521F]
How'd you manage that?

Id: [0x00055220]
Did you forget, sir? My commission is with General Braddock - when I'm not attending to you, of course.

Id: [0x00055225]
Pitcairn you fool! Your acts are treacherous. Give me one good reason I shouldn't kill you right now.

Id: [0x00055229]
...were you planning to announce yourself? Or did you hope my men wouldn't notice your arrival?

Id: [0x0005522D]
Sir, if you'll allow me to explain...

Id: [0x0005522F]
Oh, by all means. I should like very much to hear this.

Id: [0x00055230]
I have not deserted, sir. I am here under Commander Amherst's orders.

Id: [0x00055231]
Show me a letter bearing his seal and you might be spared the gallows.

Id: [0x00055232]
I have no such thing... The nature of my work, sir... It's...

Id: [0x00055234]
...It's the sort of thing best not put to paper.

Id: [0x00055236]
Haytham.

Id: [0x00055237]
General Braddock.

Id: [0x00055238]
I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Wolves often travel in packs.

Id: [0x00055239]
Master Pitcairn won't be here for but a few weeks. I shall return him to his proper post once our work is finished.

Id: [0x0005523A]
The Devil's work no doubt.

Id: [0x0005523C]
It's bad enough my superiors have insisted I grant you use of Charles. But they've said nothing about this traitor. You'll not have him.

Id: [0x0005523D]
Edward, listen to reason.

Id: [0x0005523F]
We're done here. See these gentlemen out.

Id: [0x00055243]
Well that didn't go as I expected.

Id: [0x00055244]
And to think, I used to call him brother...

Id: [0x00055245]
What now? They'll chase us off if we try and return.

Id: [0x00055247]
We're done with the camp. And as luck would have it, so are they. Come along.

Id: [0x00055257]
You again.

Id: [0x0005525B]
Let us go - and John Pitcairn with us.

Id: [0x0005525C]
I will not have my authority challenged.

Id: [0x0005525D]
Nor I.

Id: [0x0005525F]
Put them all in chains.

Id: [0x0005526D]
I assume you've good reason for causing all this madness? What is it you require of me?

Id: [0x00055275]
Gentlemen, I believe I've found the solution to our problem. Or rather, Odysseus has.

Id: [0x00055276]
Ody-ooh? 'E a new guy?

Id: [0x00055278]
The Greek hero, you lobcock.

Id: [0x00055279]
[laugh]Dodgy dodgy. [a pause]I like it.

Id: [0x0005527B]
Then let us begin. First we need to find ourselves a convoy...

Id: [0x00055286]
What happens now?

Id: [0x00055288]
We wait. [a beat]Though not for very long, I suspect...

Id: [0x0005528D]
Tell me about yourself, William.

Id: [0x0005528E]
What's to tell? I was born in Ireland, to Catholic parents which I learned early in life, severely limited my opportunities. So I converted to Protestantism and journeyed here at the behest of my uncle.

Id: [0x00055290]
But I fear my uncle Peter was not the swiftest of men. He sought to open trade with the Kanien'keh√°:ka - but chose to build his settlement away from the trade routes instead of ON them. I tried to reason with the man... But...

Id: [0x00055292]
As I said, not the swiftest. So I took what little money I'd earned and bought my own little plot of land. I built a home, a farm, a store, and a mill. Humble beginnings - but well situated, which made all the difference.

Id: [0x00055293]
So this is how you came to know the Mohawk?

Id: [0x00055294]
Indeed. And it has proved a valuable relationship.

Id: [0x00055295]
But still no mention from your contacts of the precursor site? No hidden temple or ancient constructs?

Id: [0x00055296]
Yes and no. Which is to say - they have their fair share of sacred sites - Earthen mounds, forest clearings, hidden caves... but nothing matching what you describe. No strange metals, no... odd glows.

Id: [0x00055298]
Hmm. It is well hidden.

Id: [0x00055299]
Even to them, it seems.

Id: [0x0005529B]
But cheer up, my friend. You'll have your precursor treasure. I swear it.

Id: [0x0005529D]
To our success, then.

Id: [0x0005529F]
And soon!

Id: [0x000552B1]
Any news?

Id: [0x000552B2]
Whispers of things. Nothin' solid at the moment. I know you're lookin' for word of anything out the ordinary... Dealin' with temples and spirits and ancient times and whatnot. But... so far, can't say my boys have heard much.

Id: [0x000552B3]
No trinkets or artifacts being moved through your... shadow market?

Id: [0x000552B4]
Nu'in new. Couple ill-gotten weapons - some jewelry likely lifted from a living thing. But you said to listen for talk of glows and hums and strange sights, right? An I ain't heard nothin' bout that.

Id: [0x000552B5]
Keep at it.

Id: [0x000552B6]
Oh, I will. You done me a great service, mister - and I fully intend to repay my debt - thricefold if it pleases.

Id: [0x000552B7]
Thank you, Thomas.

Id: [0x000552B8]
Place to sleep and meal to eat is thanks enough. Don't you worry. I'll get you sorted soon.

Id: [0x000552BD]
So, a question for you: why medicine?

Id: [0x000552BF]
I'm supposed to tell you I care for my fellow man - right? That I chose this path because it allows me to accomplish a greater good.

Id: [0x000552C0]
Are these things not true?

Id: [0x000552C1]
Perhaps. But that's not what guided me. No... for me it was a less abstract thing. I like money.

Id: [0x000552C2]
There are other paths to fortune.

Id: [0x000552C3]
Aye. But what better ware to peddle than LIFE? Nothing else is as precious - nor so desperately craved. And no price is too great for the man or woman who fears an abrupt and permanent end.

Id: [0x000552C4]
Your words are cruel, Benjamin.

Id: [0x000552C5]
But true as well.

Id: [0x000552C7]
You took an oath to help people, did you not?

Id: [0x000552C8]
I abide the oath, which makes no mention of price. I merely require compensation - fair compensation - for my services.

Id: [0x000552C9]
And if they lack the required funds?

Id: [0x000552CA]
Then there are others who will serve them. Does a baker grant free bread to a beggar? Does the tailor offer a dress to the woman who cannot afford to pay? No. Why should I?

Id: [0x000552CB]
You said it yourself. Nothing is more precious than life.

Id: [0x000552CC]
Indeed. All the more reason one should ensure they have the means to preserve it.

Id: [0x000552D1]
It's been several weeks now since we freed the Mohawk prisoners from captivity. I had hoped their leader might make contact, but there's been only silence. My men grow restless. They want to know what comes next, and I do not have an answer. Lee, alone, remains active - pursuing leads, however slight. He stalks the city streets and scouts the bordering woods - hopeful that he might make contact with one of those we saved. There was a woman there, that night. It was she who helped the others to safety. If we can find her, I believe I'll have my answers. So I watch and wait, hopeful  that my true mission might finally begin.

Id: [0x000552D4]
Hello, Charles. Any luck finding our mystery woman?

Id: [0x000552D5]
Word is she's been stirring up trouble just outside the city in a town called Lexington.

Id: [0x000552D6]
Well then that's where we'll begin our search! I'll meet you there.

Id: [0x000552D9]
I am afraid, I have some bad news, sir.

Id: [0x000552DA]
Oh?

Id: [0x000552DB]
Braddock is insisting I return to service under him. I've tried to beg off, to no avail.

Id: [0x000552DC]
No doubt he's still angry about losing Pitcairn - to say nothing of the shaming we gave him. Do as he asks. In the meantime, I'll work on having you released.

Id: [0x000552DD]
I am sorry for the trouble.

Id: [0x000552DE]
Not your fault.

Id: [0x000552E6]
Me. Haytham. I. Come. In. Peace.

Id: [0x000552E8]
Why are you speaking so slow?

Id: [0x000552EA]
Oh, sorry.

Id: [0x000552EC]
What do you want?

Id: [0x000552ED]
Well, your name, for one.

Id: [0x000552EF]
I am Kanieht√≠:io.

Id: [0x000552F0]
Pleased to meet you, godz-zio?

Id: [0x000552F2]
Just call me Ziio.

Id: [0x00055302]
Where did you get this?

Id: [0x00055303]
From an old friend.

Id: [0x00055305]
I've only seen such markings in one other place.

Id: [0x00055306]
Where?

Id: [0x0005530C]
Well, it is forbidden for me to speak of it.

Id: [0x0005530D]
I saved your people. Does this mean nothing to you?

Id: [0x0005530F]
Look I am not the enemy.

Id: [0x00055311]
Close to here there is a hill. Meet me there, and we'll see if you speak the truth.

Id: [0x0005531A]
That town hosts soldiers who seek to drive my people from these lands. They're led by a man known as the Bulldog.

Id: [0x0005531B]
Edward Braddock...

Id: [0x0005531C]
You know him?

Id: [0x0005531E]
He is no friend of mine.

Id: [0x00055320]
Every day more of my people are lost to men like him.

Id: [0x00055321]
Then I suggest we put a stop to it. Together.

Id: [0x00055323]
What do you propose?

Id: [0x00055324]
That we kill Edward Braddock.

Id: [0x00055326]
But first we have to find him.

Id: [0x0005532C]
Wait here. A Mohawk woman is likely to raise suspicions - if not muskets.

Id: [0x0005532E]
This is hardly the first time I've been amongst your people. I can handle myself.

Id: [0x00055331]
...planted four of them pinking-dindees just yesterday. Foul things. More beast than man...

Id: [0x00055332]
The Bulldog's offering a pound a scalp.

Id: [0x00055333]
Scalpin's savage work.

Id: [0x00055334]
Pounds is pounds.

Id: [0x00055335]
Fair 'nuff.[laugh]

Id: [0x00055339]
He's already left for the advance camp. I'd wager our little holiday here is just about ended. We'll be marching south before week's end.

Id: [0x0005533C]
Me?

Id: [0x0005533D]
No. The other cock robin.

Id: [0x00055340]
Oi, where you goin', cully?

Id: [0x00055341]
Well, I uh... I WAS leaving.

Id: [0x00055342]
Oh? And now?

Id: [0x00055343]
Well, now... I'm going to feed you your teeth.

Id: [0x00055345]
And you were worried I was going to be the problem.

Id: [0x00055349]
You are hurt.

Id: [0x0005534B]
Uch, it's nothing.

Id: [0x0005534D]
Here...

Id: [0x0005534F]
This should stop the bleeding.

Id: [0x00055351]
That wasn't necessary. [a beat]But thank you.

Id: [0x00055352]
We should move on. Meet me at Braddock's camp when you're ready.

Id: [0x00055357]
Having second thoughts?

Id: [0x0005535D]
Tell me you've good news?

Id: [0x0005535E]
General Braddock refused the offer. There will be no truce.

Id: [0x0005535F]
Dammit!

Id: [0x00055361]
Why, George? What reason did he give?

Id: [0x00055362]
He said a diplomatic solution was no solution at all. That allowing the French to retreat would only delay an inevitable conflict - one in which they'd now have the upper hand.

Id: [0x00055363]
There's merit to those words, as much as I hate to admit it. Still... can't he see this is unwise?

Id: [0x00055365]
It doesn't sit well with me either. We're far from home with our forces divided. Worse, I fear Braddock's bloodlust makes him careless. It puts the men at risk. I'd rather not be delivering grim news to mothers and widows because the Bulldog wanted to prove a point.

Id: [0x00055366]
And then it's on to Fort Duquesne, I assume?

Id: [0x00055367]
Eventually. The march north will surely take time. There's a copy of the plans in the command tent should you wish to review them.

Id: [0x00055369]
I tried, John.

Id: [0x0005536A]
I know, my friend. I know...

Id: [0x000553B8]
They come.

Id: [0x000553BD]
Everything alright, sir?

Id: [0x000553BE]
Just savoring the moment.

Id: [0x000553C5]
Now is the time to strike.

Id: [0x000553C8]
I'll disguise myself as one of his own and make my way to his side. Your ambush will provide the perfect cover for me to deliver the killing blow.

Id: [0x000553D1]
The French recognize they are weak in all things. And so they have allied themselves with the savages that inhabit these woods. Little more than animals, they sleep in trees, collect scalps, and even eat their own dead. Mercy is too kind for them. Spare no one.

Id: [0x000553D2]
But sir - those are just stories. The natives I have known do nothing of the sort.

Id: [0x000553D3]
Are you calling me a liar?

Id: [0x000553D6]
I misspoke, sir. I'm sorry. Truly, I am grateful to serve.

Id: [0x000553D9]
Have served, you mean.

Id: [0x000553DA]
Sir?

Id: [0x000553DB]
You are grateful to HAVE served.

Id: [0x000553DD]
General!

Id: [0x000553DE]
I'll not tolerate doubt amongst those I command. Nor sympathy for the enemy. I've no time for insubordination.

Id: [0x000553DF]
None deny he erred, sir. Only-

Id: [0x000553E1]
He paid for his treachery as all traitors must. If we are to win this war against the French... Nay, WHEN we win this war... It will be because men like you obeyed men like me - and did so without hesitation. We must have order amongst our ranks, and a clear chain of command. Leaders and followers. Without such structure, there can be no victory. Am I understood?

Id: [0x000553E6]
Edward!

Id: [0x000553E8]
Not so fun on the other end of the barrel, is it?

Id: [0x000553EE]
LOOK OUT!

Id: [0x000553F1]
Sir.

Id: [0x000553F6]
Where are you off to, Edward...?

Id: [0x000553FC]
I never took you for a coward, Edward.

Id: [0x000553FE]
Come on then.

Id: [0x00055401]
Such arrogance. I always knew it would be the end of you.

Id: [0x00055403]
IS the end of you.

Id: [0x00055407]
Don't.

Id: [0x00055409]
Hurry! Before he gets away!

Id: [0x0005540B]
I SAID GO!

Id: [0x00055411]
Why, Haytham?

Id: [0x00055412]
Your death opens a door. It's nothing personal.

Id: [0x00055414]
Well, maybe it is a LITTLE personal. You've been a pain in my arse, after all.

Id: [0x00055415]
But we are brothers in arms...

Id: [0x00055416]
Once, perhaps. No longer. Do you think I've forgotten what you did? All those innocents slaughtered. And for what? It does not engender peace to cut your way to resolution.

Id: [0x00055417]
Wrong! Were that we applied the sword more liberally and more often, the world would be a better place than it is today.

Id: [0x00055418]
In this instance, I concur.

Id: [0x00055425]
Farewell, Edward.

Id: [0x00055459]
No... No!

Id: [0x0005545C]
You seem disappointed.

Id: [0x0005545E]
I thought that I held a key that would open something here...

Id: [0x0005545F]
This room is all there is.

Id: [0x00055460]
I expected... more.

Id: [0x00055462]
What do they mean?

Id: [0x00055464]
It tells the story of Iottsit√≠son, who came into their world and shaped it for what life might come. She had a hard journey, fraught with great loss and peril. But she believed in her children and what they might achieve. And though she is long gone from the physical world - her eyes still watch over us. Her ears still hear our words. Her hands still guide us. And her love still gives us strength.

Id: [0x00055466]
You have shown me great kindness, Ziio. Thank you.

Id: [0x00055467]
I am sorry you did not find what you seek.

Id: [0x00055469]
I...

Id: [0x0005546B]
I should go.

Id: [0x000554BE]
Liar!

Id: [0x000554C0]
Wait. I can explain...

Id: [0x000554C2]
I should kill you for what you've done.

Id: [0x000554C4]
You've every right to your anger; To curse my name and wish me dead. But the truth is not what you believe it to be.

Id: [0x000554C6]
Kanieht√≠:io, please.

Id: [0x000554CA]
Leave this place and never return. For if you do, I will tear out your heart with my own two hands and feed it to the wolves.

Id: [0x000554CC]
Only listen to me, I...

Id: [0x000554CD]
No more words! Swear you'll do as I have asked.

Id: [0x000554CF]
Swear it!

Id: [0x000554D1]
As you wish.

Id: [0x000554ED]
[Ontenhniserohetst√°nion. Owir√†:‚Äôa wa‚Äôontehi√†:ron ti√†:takon.]Time passed. The child grew inside me.

You look... familiar. [a beat as he looks Connor up and down]Where have I seen you before?

Id: [0x00055529]
That wasn't very nice.

Id: [0x0005552B]
Let me go!

Id: [0x0005552D]
Listen to that. He knows English.

Id: [0x0005552E]
Smart for a savage.

Id: [0x0005552F]
Spirited, too.

Id: [0x00055531]
We have... questions for your elders. Only tell us where your village is, boy, and you can go.

Id: [0x00055533]
Best do as he asks, child.

Id: [0x00055535]
I could snap your neck, you know. A little more pressure and POP! The sad little flame of your life extinguished.

Id: [0x00055537]
You are a nothing. A speck of dust. You - and all your ilk. Living in the dirt like animals, oblivious to the true ways of the world. The wiser among you recognize the shape of the future. They throw themselves at our feet and beg mercy.

Id: [0x00055539]
But not you, it seems. No... You cling desperately to your ways. Too ignorant to know your folly.

Id: [0x0005553B]
But I am not unkind.

Id: [0x0005553D]
What... is your... name?

Id: [0x0005553E]
Charles Lee. Why do you ask?

Id: [0x0005553F]
So I can... find you.

Id: [0x00055541]
I look forward to it.

[Wa‚Äôkonia‚Äôtotar√≠hsi ki‚Äô. Enw√°:ton √©:ren √©nhsehte.]Then I release you. You may leave.

Id: [0x00055622]
[Oh nonti√©:ren tsi tesaterihwateni√©n:ni?]Why have you changed your mind?

Id: [0x00055623]
[√Åse‚Äôken iah thakkw√©:ni takonrihwat√©:ni.]Because I cannot change yours.

Id: [0x0005573C]
Welcome back!

Id: [0x0005573E]
You left me in Boston!

Id: [0x00055741]
The training we've done here is all well and good, but experience is a better teacher by far.

Id: [0x00055743]
What of my father?

Id: [0x00055744]
Into the wind, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x00055745]
We have to find him!

Id: [0x00055746]
And we will... AFTER the house has been repaired.

Id: [0x00055748]
But he's out there plotting who knows what.

Id: [0x00055749]
And what would you do when you found him? IF you found him? You're a boy with a few months of training. He's a man full grown who's spent decades honing his skills.

Id: [0x0005574C]
I'll miss the peace and quiet. But we can certainly use the wood.

Id: [0x0005574E]
That. And other things. Meet me at the small shack by the shoreline when you have time. There's something else you need to see.

Id: [0x0005577D]
You are a speck of dust. A nothing. You - and all your kind. Living in the dirt like animals. Oblivious to the true ways of the world...

Id: [0x0005577F]
You're not the first of your people to come here. I knew your mother well.

Id: [0x00055781]
Was she an Assassin?

Id: [0x00055782]
No. Just an ally. And a friend. There's much of her in you.

Id: [0x00055783]
And my father?

Id: [0x00055784]
You have his confidence. His passion. But his is a cold heart, and I do not think you share that.

Id: [0x00055786]
What do the Templars want?

Id: [0x00055787]
What they've always wanted: Control. They see an opportunity in the colonies. A chance for new beginnings, unfettered by the chaos of the past. This is why they back the British. Here they have a chance to illustrate the merits of their beliefs: A people in service to the principles of order and structure.

Id: [0x0005578A]
I have seen what is to come if they succeed.

Id: [0x0005578C]
They have to die, don't they? All of them. Even my father.

Id: [0x0005578D]
Especially your father. He's the one holding the whole thing together.

Id: [0x000557A6]
Connor. Spare a moment?

Id: [0x000557A7]
Of course.

Id: [0x000557AB]
Have a look.

Id: [0x000557AD]
What is it?

Id: [0x000557AF]
A Sheng Biao - or rope dart, if you prefer.

Id: [0x000557B7]
Sorry.

Id: [0x000557BE]
How did this happen?

Id: [0x000557BF]
Poachers in the woods. I asked them to leave...

Id: [0x000557C1]
...this was their answer.

Id: [0x000557C8]
Kanen't√≥:kon?

Id: [0x000557CA]
Yes, my friend.

Id: [0x000557CC]
What brings you here? [realizing]Is the village alright?

Id: [0x000557CE]
For now.

Id: [0x000557CF]
What do you mean? What has happened?

Id: [0x000557D0]
Men came, claiming we had to leave. They said that the land was being sold and that the Confederacy had consented. We sent an envoy, but they would not listen...

Id: [0x000557D1]
You must refuse!

Id: [0x000557D2]
We cannot oppose the sachem. But you are right as well. We cannot give up our home.

Id: [0x000557D3]
Do you have a name? Do you know who is responsible?

Id: [0x000557D4]
He is called William Johnson.

Id: [0x000557D8]
Where is Johnson now?

Id: [0x000557D9]
In Boston, making preparations for the sale.

Id: [0x000557DA]
Sale? This is theft.

Id: [0x000557DB]
Connor, take care. These men are powerful.

Id: [0x000557DC]
What would you have me do? I made a promise to my people.

Id: [0x000557DE]
If you insist upon this course of action, seek out Sam Adams in Boston. He'll be able to help.

Id: [0x000557E2]
What have you done?!

Id: [0x000557E3]
When my people go to war, a hatchet is buried into a post to signify its start. When the threat is ended, the hatchet is removed.

Id: [0x000557E5]
You could have used a tree!

Id: [0x000557FA]
Who, Surry? I practice what I preach, my friend. She's not a slave, but a freed woman... At least on paper. Men's minds, are not so easily turned. It is a tragedy that for all our progress, still we cling to such barbarism.

Id: [0x000557FB]
Then speak out against it.

Id: [0x000557FF]
We must focus first on defending our rights. When this is done, we'll have the luxury of addressing these other matters.

Id: [0x00055801]
You speak as though your condition is equal to that of the slaves. It is not.

Id: [0x00055802]
Tell that to my neighbor - who was compelled to quarter British troops. Or to my friend who's store was closed because he displeased the Crown. The people here are no freer than Surry.

Id: [0x00055805]
You offer excuses instead of solutions. All people should be equal. And not in turns.

Id: [0x0005582B]
I hear they've resolved to send the three ships back - cargo and all!

Id: [0x0005582C]
Aye. But Governor Hutchinson refuses to let them leave. Wants us to take the tea, pay the duties, and say thank you kindly to the King.

Id: [0x0005582D]
The King can kindly kiss my arse.

Id: [0x0005582E]
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

Id: [0x0005582F]
You can kiss it as well!

Id: [0x00055830]
Enough. What hope have we of resisting if we're arguing amongst ourselves?

Id: [0x00055832]
If Adams keeps giving these speeches, he's apt to end up in stocks.

Id: [0x00055833]
They wouldn't dare!

Id: [0x00055834]
I've seen men punished for far less.

Id: [0x00055835]
If the Tories think that'll quiet the people, they've another thing coming. They touch a hair on his head, and he becomes a martyr.

Id: [0x00055837]
Muskets'll do what words won't!

Id: [0x00055838]
Quiet! You want to be hanged for treason?

Id: [0x00055839]
There's nothin' treasonous 'bout callin' for freedom!

Id: [0x0005583A]
Tell it to the king and 'is cronies.

Id: [0x0005583B]
Men like Adams - they talk and talk and nothing happens. Naught will change until we ACT!

Id: [0x0005583C]
Give it time.

Id: [0x0005583D]
I've given more than any man should. We all have!

Id: [0x00055841]
The liberties of our Country, the freedom of our civil constitution are worth defending at all hazards: And it is our duty to defend them against all attacks. We have received them as fair inheritance from our worthy ancestors: They purchased them for us with toil and danger and expense of treasure and blood; and transmitted them to us with care and diligence. It will bring an everlasting mark of infamy on the present generation, enlightened as it is, if we should suffer them to be wrested from us by violence without a struggle; or be cheated out of them by the artifices of false and designing men. Of the latter we are in most danger at present: Let us therefore be aware of it. Let us contemplate our forefathers and posterity; and resolve to maintain the rights bequeathed to us from the former, for the sake of the latter. ‚Äî Instead of sitting down satisfied with the efforts we have already made, which is the wish of our enemies, the necessity of times, more than ever, calls for our utmost circumspection, deliberation, fortitude, and perseverance. Let us remember that "if we suffer tamely a lawless attack upon our liberty, we encourage it, and involve others in our doom." It is a very serious consideration, which should deeply impress our minds, that millions yet unborn may be the miserable sharers of the event.

Id: [0x00055845]
This meeting can do nothing further to save the country.

Id: [0x00055846]
That one.

Id: [0x00055861]
Kanen't√≥:kon? Why are you here? Has something happened?

Id: [0x00055868]
The Templars are nothing if not resourceful. You should have heeded my warning.

Id: [0x0005586F]
Brothers, please! I am confident we will find a solution.

Id: [0x00055870]
We are not your brothers.

Id: [0x00055871]
Do we not seek the same things? Peace, prosperity, fertile land.

Id: [0x00055872]
You seek land, true enough. Land that is not yours, nor any person's.

Id: [0x00055873]
I only wish to keep you safe! There are those who would betray and manipulate you. Or worse yet - take the land by force.

Id: [0x00055874]
We are all too aware of the expeditions your people send against us.

Id: [0x00055875]
What do you mean, my people? We are all ONE! We should act as such.

Id: [0x00055876]
How? By signing our lands over to you? Then we'll be as one - in your debt forever.

Id: [0x00055877]
Sir William may have a point... What hope have we against their black powder and iron?

Id: [0x00055878]
The spirits will guide us as they always have.

Id: [0x00055879]
Did they not guide us here?

Id: [0x0005587C]
Peace! Peace! Have I not always been an advocate? Have I not always sought to protect you from harm?

Id: [0x0005587D]
If you wish to protect us, then give us arms.  Muskets and horses that we might defend ourselves!

Id: [0x0005587F]
War is not the answer!

Id: [0x00055883]
We remember Stanwix! We remember you moved the borders! Even today your men dig up the land - showing no regard for those who live upon it. Your words are honeyed, but false. [a beat]We are not here to negotiate. Nor to sell. We are here to tell you and yours to leave these lands.

Id: [0x00055885]
So be it. I offered you an olive branch, and you knocked it from my hand.

Id: [0x00055887]
Perhaps you'll respond better to the sword.

Id: [0x00055888]
Are you threatening us?

Id: [0x0005588A]
Yes.

Id: [0x0005588C]
Sign the contract or more will die.

Id: [0x0005588E]
You can't be serious?

Id: [0x00055890]
Do you still doubt?

Id: [0x00055893]
Submit and he'll be spared.

Id: [0x00055895]
It seems your pride is more important than your own peoples' lives.

Id: [0x00055897]
Only two remain! Will you yield?

Id: [0x00055899]
Do you desire your death, is that it?

Id: [0x0005589B]
You had your chance. Men, to arms!

Id: [0x000558A1]
Ah, no. What have you done?

Id: [0x000558A2]
Ensured an end to your schemes. You sought to claim these lands for the Templars...

Id: [0x000558A3]
Aye. That we might PROTECT them! Do you think that good King George lies awake at night hoping that no harm comes to his native subjects? Or that the people of the city care one whit about them? Oh, sure, the colonists are happy to trade when they need food or shelter or a bit of extra padding for their armies. But when the walls of the city constrict - when there‚Äôs crops that need soil - when there's... when there‚Äôs no more enemy to fight - we'll see how kind the people are then.

Id: [0x000558A4]
The colonists have no quarrel with the Iroquois.

Id: [0x000558A5]
Not yet. But they will. 'Tis the way of the world. In time, they'll turn. [a beat; wistful]I... I could have stopped it. I could have saved you all...

Id: [0x000558A6]
You speak of salvation, but you were killing them.

Id: [0x000558A7]
Aye. Because they would not listen! And so, it seems, neither will you...

Id: [0x000558B4]
Wot's this?

Id: [0x000558B5]
Thomas Hickey?

Id: [0x000558B6]
Might be. What's it to ya?

Id: [0x000558BB]
Ain't s'pposed to be none of your kind left.

Id: [0x000558BD]
Suppose I'd best be rectifyin' that, then. Get 'im!

Id: [0x000558CB]
Your a right fool, meddlin' in affairs you know nuttin' about.

Id: [0x000558CC]
Washington's the only thing keeping the Continental Army together. You kill him - and you end all hope for freedom.

Id: [0x000558CD]
Wrong, boy-o. Wit 'im gone, they'd have no choice but to promote Lee. And then-

Id: [0x000558D2]
You are both under arrest.

Id: [0x000558D3]
Ah well, we were just havin' a scrap, officer! Ain't nuttin' wrong with two men settlin' their differences the ol' fashi'n way. Can't we come to-

Id: [0x000558D4]
What are the charges?

Id: [0x000558D6]
Counterfeiting.

Id: [0x000558D8]
I had nothing to do with that!

Id: [0x000558F2]
You...

Id: [0x000558F3]
You miss me, swee'art?

Id: [0x000558F5]
Wot? Nothin' to say?

Id: [0x000558F6]
If you are here, then Washington is safe.

Id: [0x000558F9]
...I believe I've just been pardoned.

Id: [0x00055918]
Thank you kindly for the rescue, gents.

Id: [0x00055919]
There can be no further mistakes, Thomas. Am I understood?

Id: [0x0005591C]
Wot about the Assassin?

Id: [0x00055920]
Deal with this Charles.

Id: [0x0005592E]
You would like that, wouldn't you? To rid the world of all who do not share your views.

Id: [0x00055930]
Guilty as charged.

Id: [0x00055931]
I know that the people wish to be free - and that men like Washington fight to make it so.

Id: [0x00055939]
I said I would find you.

Id: [0x0005593A]
And so you have. But not quite as you had expected, am I right? [a sigh]You know - all of this might have been avoided, had you only done as I'd asked.

Id: [0x000559A9]
We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connections between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

Id: [0x000559AD]
It's quite impressive, what you've accomplished.

Id: [0x000559AE]
The people yearned for freedom, but feared to grab hold of it. That fear is gone now.

Id: [0x000559AF]
Thanks to you.

Id: [0x000559B0]
No. This they did on their own.

Id: [0x000559B1]
You diminish your role. But you've always been of humble heart.

Id: [0x000559B2]
I do what is right. No more. No less.

Id: [0x000559B4]
You cannot tell him.

Id: [0x000559B5]
I have to. Otherwise, he will never be safe.

Id: [0x000559B6]
He is safer not knowing! By planting the seeds of doubt, you threaten to topple his entire endeavor. If Washington is paralyzed, Charles Lee will strike. You'll cause the very thing you aim to prevent. Hunt the Templars, as is your duty... But do not drag these men into it.

Id: [0x000559DB]
We must now all hang together.

Id: [0x000559DD]
Yes, we must indeed all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately.

Id: [0x000559E2]
You are, once more, our savior.

Id: [0x000559E3]
I must speak with the Commander.

Id: [0x000559E5]
He's gone to try and hold New York. The British intend to take it. I fear we'll need to recall our men from Quebec as well... It's one thing to declare our Independence. Now, my friend, we must make it so.

Id: [0x000559EB]
Winter approaches. The air is still and sharp with grim expectation. The others sense it too, and go about their work with uncommon urgency. I would like to help them, but more pressing matters now demand my attention. The Templars have targeted George Washington directly - and will not rest until he is dead. I had hoped to shield him from this knowledge, but Thomas Hickey ended any hope I had of staying silent. And so I have resolved to share everything I know - of the Templars and their plots - of who I really am. Achilles finds fault in this, and we argue every day. But there is simply too much now at stake to maintain restraint.

Id: [0x000559EE]
Don't do this, Connor!

Id: [0x000559EF]
Then what would you propose we do? Sit and watch while the Templars take control?

Id: [0x000559F0]
Assassins are meant to be quiet. Precise. We do not go announcing conspiracies from the rooftops to all who pass by.

Id: [0x000559F2]
Who are you to lecture anyone? You locked yourself away in this crumbling heap and gave up on the Brotherhood entirely. Since the day I arrived, you‚Äôve done nothing but discourage me. And on the rare occasions you‚Äôve chosen to help, you‚Äôve done so little, you may as well have done nothing at all.

Id: [0x000559F3]
How dare you!

Id: [0x000559F4]
Then tell me: On whose watch did the brotherhood falter? Whose inaction allowed the Templar Order to grow so large that it now controls an entire nation!

Id: [0x000559F6]
If I sought to dissuade you, it was because you knew nothing! If I was reluctant to contribute, it was because you were naive. A thousand times you would have died and taken God knows how many with you. [a beat]Let me tell you something, Connor: Life is not a fairy tale and there are no happy endings.

Id: [0x000559F7]
No. Not when men like you are left in charge.

Id: [0x000559FA]
In your haste to save the world, boy - take care you don't destroy it!

Id: [0x00055A01]
Hold! Who goes there? Declare your allegiance or forfeit your life.

Id: [0x00055A03]
Commander, tell your soldiers to stand down.

Id: [0x00055A05]
At ease, men. He means no harm.

Id: [0x00055A07]
What troubles you?

Id: [0x00055A09]
Send them away.

Id: [0x00055A0A]
These are my most loyal men.

Id: [0x00055A0B]
You would have said the same of Hickey.

Id: [0x00055A0D]
Ride ahead. We won't be far behind.

Id: [0x00055A12]
This is a private matter.

Id: [0x00055A13]
My friend, I swear you've nothing to fear from me. The safety and security of our esteemed Commandant (Commander) is my top - no, no... my ONLY priority.

Id: [0x00055A14]
Who are you?

Id: [0x00055A15]
I am Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette. I serve at the pleasure of Monsieur Washington as his aide-de-camp. And yourself?

Id: [0x00055A16]
My name is Connor. And I am -

Id: [0x00055A17]
Ah, yes! The agitateur (agitator). I've heard all about you and your grand exploits. I should like to learn more about your methods... but I sense you have other things on your mind. Do not allow me distract you further.

Id: [0x00055A19]
Commander Washington, listen. Charles Lee aims to betray you.

Id: [0x00055A1B]
If Charles aims to betray, he's chosen a strange way to go about it. He's been seized by the British. Ambushed at White's Tavern in Basking Ridge about a week ago.

Id: [0x00055A1D]
This makes no sense...

Id: [0x00055A1F]
I admit the circumstances of his capture were quite strange, but I think it owes more to arrogance than treachery.

Id: [0x00055A20]
How do you know it was not what he intended? That he is not revealing all he knows right now?

Id: [0x00055A7F]
Mon dieu! (My God!) I expected things might be somewhat difficult - but this...

Id: [0x00055A80]
Indeed.

Id: [0x00055A81]
No matter. We shall make do with what we have! Now, come, let us tour the camp!

Id: [0x00055A84]
Damn! That's the second one today. We've buried more shovels than men...

Id: [0x00055A85]
I know they're deservin of proper respect 'an all, but it might be time to consider an alternative...

Id: [0x00055A87]
'Least the cold keeps the smell at bay.

Id: [0x00055A8C]
Son of a bitch!

Id: [0x00055A8D]
Careful with that! We're low on tallow as it is. Don't need to be losing more to incompetence.

Id: [0x00055A8F]
It's these boots, sir... They're coming apart - tripping me up.

Id: [0x00055A90]
Then go barefoot if needed! No more excuses!

Id: [0x00055A93]
They're right bastards - dumping us in 'ese woods to waste away...

Id: [0x00055A94]
Like they're playin' right into the Imperials' hands...

Id: [0x00055A95]
Graves and two others left last night - back to Virgina, I reckon. Might be we need to consider the same?

Id: [0x00055A97]
An why should it be us that leaves, eh? It's our blood bein' spilled. Our backs bein broke. Let the Commander go instead - an' 'e can take 'is fool crew wit' 'im!

Id: [0x00055A9B]
Fancy a quick game, gents?

Id: [0x00055A9C]
There's money to be made!

Id: [0x00055A9E]
Perhaps another time, friends.

Id: [0x00055A9F]
You know where to find us!

Id: [0x00055AA0]
I'd rather find them on the practice field...

Id: [0x00055AA1]
Men must rest and work in equal measure - lest they lose their spirit.

Id: [0x00055AA2]
I've seen a lot of spirit, George. It's the lack of work that worries...

Id: [0x00055AA5]
Daily rations are delivered at sunrise and sundown. I've got a bit of extra sackcloth and wool for those in serious need!

Id: [0x00055AA7]
I said SERIOUS NEED!

Id: [0x00055AA8]
This is serious!

Id: [0x00055AA9]
My coat's about worn through!

Id: [0x00055AAA]
Least you've still got a coat.

Id: [0x00055AAC]
I'm sorry, but that's all there is. We're hoping for another shipment tomorrow. You've just got to be patient. Congress will get us what we need! I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x00055AAE]
If he only knew the truth... I've been sending requisition requests for weeks. But the Board of War would rather play games with Thomas Conway. I'd dismiss the whole lot of them if I could.

Id: [0x00055AB0]
I will speak with the quartermaster later. Maybe there's something I can do.

Id: [0x00055AB1]
You are too kind, Connor.

Id: [0x00055AB4]
Where the hell are my supplies? They should have been here a week ago...

Id: [0x00055AB5]
I am sorry, I have nothing left. I have sent a girl to look for some whiskey. It will dull the pain at least.

Id: [0x00055AB6]
The wound is gone bad... I do not expect he will make it through the night.

Id: [0x00055AB7]
What do they expect from me?!  I have neither tools nor tinctures left.  I am not a goddam wizard!

Id: [0x00055ABA]
Just another spoonful. Please.

Id: [0x00055ABB]
It's melted snow. Nothing more. Starvation is going to do us in long before the enemy.

Id: [0x00055ABC]
I hear they've hunted all the game there is to find here... It'll be rocks and twigs for supper soon enough.

Id: [0x00055ABF]
Look at this... thin as a sapling. Hardly any meat to speak of. Least the hide should make for a decent cloak or two...

Id: [0x00055AD0]
It seems, Monsieur Washington, that there is much work to be done here. But this is why you recruited me, no? Fear not. I will see these fripouilles (scoundrels) turned into men.

Id: [0x00055AD2]
Now to find my quarters...

Id: [0x00055ADB]
First position!

Id: [0x00055ADD]
Second position!

Id: [0x00055ADF]
Form a line!

Id: [0x00055AE1]
Ready weapons!

Id: [0x00055AE3]
Take aim!

Id: [0x00055AE5]
Stand down!

Id: [0x00055AEA]
Storm's coming! Or are you bastards blind? We need to get these supplies under cover! Now! Or would you rather stay outside and make snow angels while your brothers and sisters DIE because you didn't feel like working!

Id: [0x00055AEB]
Stoke those fires and get them covered! What's that Harrison? You've got better things to do? We'll see how much you like it when you freeze to death out here because you couldn't be assed to do your goddam job!

Id: [0x00055AEC]
You're all useless! Come running out here into the woods swearing you'll bring the fight to the imperials - that you're REAL MEN. And now look at you! Crying and complaining like wee babes!

Id: [0x00055AED]
I saw that, Fitzpatrick! You let so much as a SINGLE GRAIN fall out of that sack again, I'll have you beaten so hard your head'll pop off!

Id: [0x00055AEE]
Get those crates to cover or God help me I'll shove my boot so far up your ass you'll all be tasting leather for the rest of your worthless lives!

Id: [0x00055B09]
Sir - before you go...

Id: [0x00055B0A]
Right. Charles Lee. [he nods]I still suspect you mistake ambition for evil, but I'll look into it. Find me later - I should know more after I've made the rounds.

Id: [0x00055B0F]
Commander.

Id: [0x00055B10]
Connor.

Id: [0x00055B11]
Any word on Lee?

Id: [0x00055B12]
Not yet. [a beat]My apologies, I've been distracted.

Id: [0x00055B16]
Supply caravans meant for the camp have gone missing. I suspect treachery.

Id: [0x00055B1F]
As you wish. [a beat]We've received reports of trouble along the southern road. Might be he's responsible. I suggest you begin your search there.

Id: [0x00055B83]
Wait.

Id: [0x00055B85]
A poor choice.

Id: [0x00055B8B]
Come to check up on Church? Make sure he'd stolen enough for your British brothers?

Id: [0x00055B8D]
Benjamin Church is no brother of mine. No more than the Redcoats or their idiot king.

Id: [0x00055B91]
I expected naivet√©. But this... The Templars do not fight for the crown. We seek the same as you, boy! Freedom. Justice. Independence.

Id: [0x00055B94]
But...

Id: [0x00055B95]
Hmmm! But what?

Id: [0x00055B96]
Johnson. Pitcairn. Hickey. They sought to steal land. To sack towns. To murder George Washington.

Id: [0x00055B98]
Johnson sought to own the land that we might keep it safe. Pitcairn aimed to encourage diplomacy - which you cocked up thoroughly enough to start a god-damned war! And Hickey? George Washington is a wretched leader. He's lost nearly every battle in which he's taken part. The man's wracked with uncertainty and insecurity. Only look at Valley Forge to know my words are true. We're all be better off without him.

Id: [0x00055B9D]
Look - much as I'd love to spar with you, Benjamin Church's mouth is as big as his ego.  You clearly want the supplies he's stolen, I want him punished. Our interests are aligned.

Id: [0x00055B9E]
What do you propose?

Id: [0x00055B9F]
A truce. [long inhale]Perhaps... perhaps some time together might do us good.  You are my son, after all, and might still be saved from your ignorance.

Id: [0x00055BA2]
I can kill you now if you'd prefer?

Id: [0x00055BAA]
Evening Connor.

Id: [0x00055BAC]
Recovered from your beating, then?

Id: [0x00055BAE]
Benjamin Church is holed up in an abandoned brewery on the waterfront. We should be done with this by sunrise.

Id: [0x00055BB1]
Good. I would like to have those supplies returned as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00055BB2]
Of course. I wouldn't want to keep you from your lost cause.

Id: [0x00055BB4]
Come along then. Follow me.

Id: [0x00055BB6]
Tell me something... You could have killed me when we first met - what stayed your hand?

Id: [0x00055BB7]
Curiosity. Any other questions?

Id: [0x00055BB8]
What is it the Templars truly seek?

Id: [0x00055BB9]
Order. Purpose. Direction. No more than that. It's your lot that means to confound with this nonsense talk of freedom. Time was, the Assassins professed a far more sensible goal, that of peace.

Id: [0x00055BBA]
Freedom IS peace.

Id: [0x00055BBC]
Oh, no. It's an invitation to chaos. Only look at this little revolution your friends have started. I have stood before the Continental Congress and listened to them stamp and shout. All in the name of liberty. But it is just noise.

Id: [0x00055BBF]
And this is why you favor Lee?

Id: [0x00055BC0]
He understands the needs of this would-be nation far better than the jobbernowls who profess to represent it.

Id: [0x00055BC1]
[laugh]It seems your tongue has tasted sour grapes. The people have made their choice - and it was Washington.

Id: [0x00055BC3]
The people chose nothing. It was done by a group of privileged cowards seeking only to enrich themselves. They convened in private and made a decision that would benefit THEM. Oh, they might have dressed it up with pretty words, but that does not make it true.

Id: [0x00055BC5]
The only difference, Connor - the ONLY difference between myself and those you aid - is that I do not feign affection.

Id: [0x00055BCB]
Hold a moment.

Id: [0x00055BCD]
Church, you clever bastard!

Id: [0x00055BCE]
What is it?

Id: [0x00055BCF]
I was hoping I could wave you past the guards, but he's replaced most of them with men I don't know. [a beat]Hmmm. Well I should be able to pass without arousing suspicion. But you...

Id: [0x00055BD3]
No. We do this together or not at all.

Id: [0x00055BD4]
Then what do you propose?

Id: [0x00055BD5]
I will find a guard who is off duty and take his uniform.

Id: [0x00055BDD]
Hold strangers! You tread on private property. What business have you here?

Id: [0x00055BDF]
The Father of Understanding guides us.

Id: [0x00055BE1]
You, I recognize. Not the savage.

Id: [0x00055BE3]
He is my son.

Id: [0x00055BE5]
Tasted of the forest's fruits, did you?

Id: [0x00055BE7]
Off you go, then.

Id: [0x00055BF5]
Benjamin Church. You stand accused of betraying the Templar Order and abandoning our principles in pursuit of personal gain. In consideration of your crime, I hereby sentence you to DEATH.

Id: [0x00055C04]
You're too late. Church and the cargo are long gone. And I'm afraid you won't be in any condition to follow...

Id: [0x00055C07]
We've chosen to stand with the victor. It's Britain who'll win this war!

Id: [0x00055C08]
You always did prefer principle to profit. Perhaps that's why your little kingdom's started to crumble!

Id: [0x00055C09]
It was a nice dream you had - but a dream is all it ever was...

Id: [0x00055C0A]
Look at that half breed fight! Like some feral dog... Best we put him down, boys!

Id: [0x00055C64]
Church has at least a day on us... We must move quickly if we're to catch him.

Id: [0x00055C65]
I have a ship we can use.

Id: [0x00055C67]
Meet me on the pier when you're ready.

Id: [0x00055C6C]
Shall we?

Id: [0x00055C75]
I told you this was a poor heading. Church is surely days ahead of us now...

Id: [0x00055CA0]
Strange that they do not attack.

Id: [0x00055CA4]
It seems the ship has been abandoned.

Id: [0x00055CA5]
Church always was a slippery little bastard...

Id: [0x00055CB3]
Men, prepare to board-

Id: [0x00055CB5]
What are you doing?!

Id: [0x00055CB6]
Ending this!

Id: [0x00055CBA]
Secure the ships!!

Id: [0x00055CC0]
Empty...  What has Church done with the cargo?

Id: [0x00055CC3]
So here we are, face to face at last, my friend. It's been quite an adventure - let me tell you - working my way through your nasty little tricks and traps. Clever. Some of them, anyway. I'll give you credit for that. And for the quietude with which you pulled it off. We had a DREAM, Benjamin! A dream you sought to DESTROY! And for that, my fallen friend, you will be made to pay.

Id: [0x00055CC7]
Enough!

Id: [0x00055CC9]
We came here for a reason.

Id: [0x00055CCA]
Different reasons, it seems.

Id: [0x00055CCC]
Where are the supplies you stole?

Id: [0x00055CCE]
Go to hell.

Id: [0x00055CD0]
Come on then! Do it!

Id: [0x00055CD1]
Finish this, boy! Or are you having second thoughts?

Id: [0x00055CD2]
NOW you waver? NOW you doubt?

Id: [0x00055CD4]
When Britain first, at Heaven's command; Arose from out the azure main; This was the charter, the charter of the land, the guardian angels sang this strain: "Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves: Britons never... never, never will be slaves."

Id: [0x00055CD6]
Shut your mouth, Church!

Id: [0x00055CD8]
The nations, not so blest as thee; Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall; While thou shalt flourish... flourish great and free, The dread and envy of them all. Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves: Britons never... never, never will be slaves.

Id: [0x00055CDA]
Connor! Get what you need from him and let's be done with this!

Id: [0x00055CDB]
Still more majestic shalt thou rise, More dreadful, from each foreign stroke; As the loud blast that tears the skies, serves but to root thy native oak. Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves: Britons never... never, never will be slaves!

Id: [0x00055CDD]
What are you waiting for?! Finish him NOW, or I'll do it for you.

Id: [0x00055CDF]
Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves: Britons never... never, never will be slaves.

Id: [0x00055CE2]
I ask again: where are the supplies?

Id: [0x00055CE3]
On the island yonder, awaiting pickup. But you've no right to it. It isn't yours.

Id: [0x00055CE4]
No, not mine. Those supplies are meant for men and women who believe in something bigger than themselves. Who fight and die that one day they might be free from tyranny such as yours.

Id: [0x00055CE5]
Are these the same men and women who fight with muskets forged from British steel? Who bind their wounds with bandages sewn by British hands. How convenient for them. We do the work. They reap the rewards.

Id: [0x00055CE7]
You spin a story to excuse your crimes. As though you're the innocent one and they the thieves.

Id: [0x00055CE8]
It's all a matter of perspective. There is no single path through life that's right and fair and does no harm. Do you truly think the Crown has no cause? No right to feel betrayed? You should know better than this, dedicated as you are to fighting Templars - who themselves see their work as just. Think on that the next time you insist your work alone befits the greater good. Your enemy would beg to differ - and would not be without cause.

Id: [0x00055CEC]
You did well. His passing was a boon for us both.

Id: [0x00055CEE]
Come on. I expect you'll want my help retrieving everything from the island?

Id: [0x00055D01]
Must be strange for you, discovering my existence as you have.

Id: [0x00055D02]
I'm actually curious to know what your mother might have said about me. I always wondered what life might have been like had she and I stayed together. How is she, by the way?

Id: [0x00055D03]
Dead. Murdered.

Id: [0x00055D05]
What? [a beat]I am sorry to hear that.

Id: [0x00055D09]
Oh you're sorry? I found my mother burning alive. I'll never forget her face as she sent me away. Charles Lee is responsible for her death by your order. And you're sorry?

Id: [0x00055D0F]
That's impossible. I gave no such order. I spoke the opposite, in fact - I told them to give up the search for the Precursor Site. We were to focus on more practical pursuits...

Id: [0x00055D10]
It is done and I am all out of forgiveness.

Id: [0x00055D18]
I have been reunited with my father, but I do not yet know if this bodes well or ill. Our goals are aligned, at least so far as independence is concerned. But he continues to defend Charles Lee - the man who murdered my mother and burned my village... [a beat]Still, he makes a point about Washington and those who back him. I hear much talk of freedom and equality, but it seems one must be a landed white man to benefit. What of someone like me? Or Surry? What role for us in this new world? Is my father right, then? There is so much I must consider and so little time in which to do it.

Id: [0x00055D1D]
Achilles... I... I owe you an apology...

Id: [0x00055D1E]
Your words were harsh, Connor, but there was also truth there. I failed the Order. Allowed the Templars to take control...

Id: [0x00055D2C]
Even he must admit that we achieve more together than we do alone.

Id: [0x00055D2D]
I assume you're off to find him?

Id: [0x00055D2E]
Yes. I ride for New York to see what might be done.

Id: [0x00055D45]
I am unconvinced. To reinforce them would leave New York exposed. It's hard enough maintaining order with our current numbers. Cut in half...

Id: [0x00055D47]
Well they should have come by sea...

Id: [0x00055D4E]
They're talking in circles. We'll learn nothing, watching as we are.

Id: [0x00055D4F]
Then what do you propose we do? March in there and demand answers?

Id: [0x00055D50]
Well, yes.

Id: [0x00055D5D]
Connor! A little help, here?

Id: [0x00055D61]
Leave the commanders alive, Connor! We can interrogate them.

Id: [0x00055D64]
We'll bring them to my quarters at Fort George and see what secrets they might share.

Id: [0x00055D68]
Well you'd best get after him, then.

Id: [0x00055D69]
You go. I will watch the prisoners.

Id: [0x00055D6A]
No, you do it.

Id: [0x00055D6B]
Why me?

Id: [0x00055D6C]
Because I said so! Now go!

Id: [0x00055D71]
Wait, wait! I'll tell you anything you want. Anything! Only don't make me go in there!

Id: [0x00055D73]
We just have some questions for you.

Id: [0x00055D74]
Cross that threshold and I'm a dead man!

Id: [0x00055D76]
There you are, Connor! I was worried you might have gotten lost...

Id: [0x00055D78]
Come along, then!

Id: [0x00055D81]
What are the British planning?

Id: [0x00055D85]
To march from Philadelphia. That city's finished. New York's the key. They'll double our numbers - push back the rebels.

Id: [0x00055D86]
When do they begin?

Id: [0x00055D87]
Two days from now.

Id: [0x00055D88]
June 18th... I must warn Washington.

Id: [0x00055D89]
You see? That wasn't so very difficult, now was it?

Id: [0x00055D8A]
I've t-told you everything! Now l-let me go!

Id: [0x00055D8C]
Of course.

Id: [0x00055D8F]
The other two said the same. It must be true.

Id: [0x00055D91]
You killed him... You killed ALL of them. Why?

Id: [0x00055D92]
They'd have warned the Loyalists.

Id: [0x00055D93]
You could have held them until the fight was done.

Id: [0x00055D94]
What? ...And waste precious time and money on their care? What would be the point? They'd given up everything they knew.

Id: [0x00055D9B]
I'll meet you at Valley Forge.

Id: [0x00055DA0]
We should be sharing what we know with Lee, not Washington...

Id: [0x00055DA5]
You have SAID much, yes. But you have SHOWN me nothing.

Id: [0x00055DA6]
Then we'll have to remedy that then, won't we...

Id: [0x00055DAA]
Sir.

Id: [0x00055DAB]
Hello, Connor. What brings you here?

Id: [0x00055DAC]
The British have recalled their men in Philadelphia. They march for New York.

Id: [0x00055DAE]
Very well. I'll move our forces to Monmouth. If we can rout them, we'll have finally turned the tide.

Id: [0x00055DC2]
And what's this?

Id: [0x00055DC4]
Private correspondence!

Id: [0x00055DC5]
Of course it is. Would you like to know what it says, Connor?

Id: [0x00055DC7]
It seems your good friend here has just ordered an attack on your village. Although attack might be putting it mildly.

Id: [0x00055DCA]
Tell him, Commander.

Id: [0x00055DCB]
We've been receiving reports of allied natives working with the British. I've asked my men to put a stop to it.

Id: [0x00055DCC]
By burning their villages and salting the land. By calling for their extermination, according to this letter.

Id: [0x00055DCE]
Not the first time either. Tell him what you did fourteen years ago.

Id: [0x00055DD0]
That was another time. The Seven Years War.

Id: [0x00055DD8]
And so now you see what happens to this "great man" when under duress. He makes excuses, displaces blame. Does a great many things, in fact - except take responsibility.

Id: [0x00055DDF]
Enough! Who did what and why must wait. My people come first.

Id: [0x00055DE0]
Then let's be off.

Id: [0x00055DE1]
No. You and I are finished.

Id: [0x00055DE2]
Son...

Id: [0x00055DE4]
Do you think me so soft that by calling me son I might change my mind? How long did you sit on this information? Or am I to believe you discovered it now? My mother's blood may stain another's hands, but Charles Lee is no less a monster, and all he does, he does by your command.

Id: [0x00055DE8]
A warning to you both - choose to follow me or oppose me and I will kill you.

Id: [0x00055DED]
[breath]I should make sure the village is safe...

Id: [0x00055DF1]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x00055DF6]
[√ìnhka k√≠:ken √≥:ia r√≥n:kwe?]What other man?

Id: [0x00055DF7]
[Teiohnek√≥ntie‚Äôs. Charles Lee ronwana‚Äôt√≥nhkhwa. Iahshakoia‚Äôt√©nhawe Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon t√°non‚Äô tohk√°ra nih√°:ti.]Boiling Water. The one called Charles Lee. He took Kanen't√≥:kon and a few others with him.

Id: [0x00055DF9]
[Nah√≤:ten? Ka‚Äô n√≥n:we niehon√©:non?]What? Where have they gone?

Id: [0x00055DFA]
[Wa‚Äôtehshakotitahst√†:na tsi nih√°:ti enionkhiionhontsahkhwa.]To push back those who would take our land.

Id: [0x00055DFB]
[Iah. Iah tetkarihwai√©:ri.]No. This is wrong...

Id: [0x00055DFC]
[Oh niionti√©:ren tsi tesa‚Äônik√≥nhrhare? Iah ken tha‚Äôtesatonhonts√≥:ni ne k√≠:ken? Ne aiakwater√≠:io?]Why are you troubled? Is this not what you wanted? For us to take a stand?

Id: [0x00055DFE]
[√ì:nen‚Äôk tsi iensti√°:ken‚Äône. Teiotonhonts√≥hon takh√©:tahste.]I... I have to go. I need to stop them.

Id: [0x00055E04]
[Sk√©n:nen, Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon!]Peace Kanen't√≥:kon!

Id: [0x00055E05]
[Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Tahskwahseht√†:ne ken?]Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Come to kill me yourself?

Id: [0x00055E06]
[Nah√≤:ten?!]What?!

Id: [0x00055E07]
[Akw√©:kon wahakhr√≥:ri ne Charles Lee. B√°thriot tehonatonhonts√≥:ni aionkhiia‚Äôw√©ntho. T√°non‚Äô ken √≠:se enhshei√©:nawa‚Äôse.]Charles Lee told me everything. The Patriots seek to destroy us. And you would aid them.

Id: [0x00055E08]
[Atsh√≥:ken th√≠:ken r√≥n:kwe!]That man is a liar!

Id: [0x00055E0B]
[Wah√®n:ron tsi tesa‚Äônikonhrat√©nion. Tsi enhsate‚Äôni√©n:ten tahskwa‚Äônikonhrak√©n:ni. Nek tsi √≥:nen k√®n:‚Äôen r√≥n:nete tsi ionkwahnhok√†:ronte.]He said you had been corrupted. That you would try to deceive. But here they are on our doorstep. What say you to that?

Id: [0x00055E33]
Connor?

Id: [0x00055E34]
Charles Lee has betrayed you. He forced retreat in the midst of battle - hoping the loss would take the lives of your men and see you relieved of your command.

Id: [0x00055E35]
What?!

Id: [0x00055E36]
I am sure he will come and spin a tale - saying he was outnumbered - or I was somehow to blame. All lies. [a beat]I will say it one last time - that man is your enemy and he will not stop until you are dead or dishonored.

Id: [0x00055E38]
The time for that is long past.

Id: [0x00055E3A]
This must be done properly, else we're no better than those we oppose. Nevermind the political ramifications of such an act.

Id: [0x00055E3C]
Should you choose to spare Lee's life then I will take it myself.

Id: [0x00055E3F]
Enjoy your victory, Commander. It will be the last I deliver you.

Id: [0x00055E72]
They say you took down that man-of-war all alone. Perhaps Lafayette did not exaggerate when he spoke of your abilities. As promised, my ships are yours to command. What do you require?

Id: [0x00055E92]
Where are you, Charles...?

Id: [0x00055E94]
Gone.

Id: [0x00055E9C]
Come now, you cannot hope to match me, Connor. For all your skills, you're still but a boy - with so much left to learn.

Id: [0x00055E9F]
Give me Lee.

Id: [0x00055EA0]
Impossible. He is the promise of a better future. The sheep need a shepherd.

Id: [0x00055EA3]
He has been dismissed and censured. He can do nothing for you now.

Id: [0x00055EA5]
We have an opportunity here. To break the cycle, and end this ancient war. I know it.

Id: [0x00055EB3]
Don't think I have any intention of caressing your cheek and saying I was wrong. I will not weep and wonder what might have been. I'm sure you understand.

Id: [0x00055EB5]
Still, I'm proud of you in a way. You have shown great conviction. Strength. Courage. All noble qualities...

Id: [0x00055EC0]
My father is dead. Charles Lee now leads the Templar Order in his place. I see now why ours is an eternal war. For each piece taken from the board, another is placed upon it. Back and forth we go. Across the world. Across the ages. Some days, mine feels an impossible task, but I cannot afford to be consumed with doubt. The people need me. Now, more than ever. I must stop the Templars. I will kill Charles Lee.

Id: [0x00055EC4]
We gather today to remember a man of peerless vision, who sought to change the world. And change the world he did. Look around. Even now the British prepare to retreat - their spirits broken - their forces splintered. The Patriot leadership shall soon follow - either into our service or into the ground. And then, my friends, all of this will finally be ours!

Id: [0x00055EC6]
Aye. It seems a mad thing, now. And it cost him his life. The Assassins are a cruel and terrible coven. They speak only the language of death. Too late he learned the truth of this - murdered by his own son. He gave his life as he lived it - in service to a dream we all share. And so we must fight on! We will vanquish our enemies. We will spread our word! And in time, my brothers and sisters, in time we will have our New World.

Id: [0x00055ECA]
He sent me away... That day at Fort George. He feared for my safety. I should have stayed.

Id: [0x00055ECC]
He said there was no danger.

Id: [0x00055ECD]
He was wrong.

Id: [0x00055ECF]
I will kill you, Connor. This, I swear. Not here, though. Not today. No... First - first I'll destroy all you hold dear. I'll burn that homestead of yours to the ground - and roast the severed heads of your precious "founding fathers" in its flames. And when I've finished with them, all the rest will burn as well. Your merry band of Assassins. The human refuse that lives on your land. Your village and its people. All of it - gone!

Id: [0x00055ED0]
You can try, Charles. But as with all your schemes, this too will end in failure.

Id: [0x00055ED2]
He will wait. He will watch. And then - when he's seen all his life's work brought to ruin... Only then will I allow him to die. Take him away.

Id: [0x00055F21]
If you're hungry, I've extra.

Id: [0x00055F22]
No thank you... Where is everyone?

Id: [0x00055F23]
Gone west. Been a while since they left. Seems some fella from New York was granted the land by congress.

Id: [0x00055F24]
What?

Id: [0x00055F25]
Seein' it happen more and more. Government SAYS they don't take land that's already owned, but, uh...

Id: [0x00055F26]
How could this have happened?

Id: [0x00055F27]
We're on our own now. No more Merry English parts and labor. Which means we gotta go at it ourselves. Gotta pay for it too. Sellin' land is quick and easy and not quite so nasty as taxes. And since some say they're what started the whole war, ain't no rush to bring 'em back.

Id: [0x00055F29]
Clever men, these new leaders of ours. They know not to push it just yet. Too soon for taxes. Too... British.

Id: [0x00055F2B]
But it'll come. Always does.

Id: [0x00055F3A]
Ah... Long have we waited for you to return. You have done as we asked. You have succeeded.

Id: [0x00055F3B]
No. I have failed. My people are gone - chased out by those who I thought would protect them...

Id: [0x00055F3C]
It is a trade. A sacrifice. And not in vain.

Id: [0x00055F3E]
For you have found it.

Id: [0x00055F40]
This?

Id: [0x00055F41]
Now you must hide it.  Where none shall think to look.

Id: [0x00055F43]
And then in time... In time... What once was... shall be... again.

Id: [0x00055F44]
I do not understand...

Id: [0x00055F45]
Nor need you. Only do as we ask. Then you may do as you wish.

Id: [0x00055F46]
But what of my people?

Id: [0x00055F47]
You have saved this place - as was your people's purpose. And that matters most.

Id: [0x00055F48]
It is not enough!

Id: [0x00055F49]
It will never be enough. You strive for that which does not exist.

Id: [0x00055F4B]
Still you have made a difference. And you will do so again.

Id: [0x00055F53]
Mother. Father.

Id: [0x00055F55]
I am sorry. I have failed you both.

Id: [0x00055F57]
I made a promise to protect our people. I thought... I thought if I could stop the Templars... If I could keep the revolution free from their influence... That those I supported would do what was right.

Id: [0x00055F59]
They did, I suppose, do what was right... What was right for them.

Id: [0x00055F5B]
As for you, father... I thought I might unite us. That we would forget the past and forge a better future. In time, I believed you could be made to see the world as I did. To understand. But it was just a dream. This too, I should have known.

Id: [0x00055F5D]
Were we not meant to live in peace, then? Is that it? Are we born to argue? To fight? So many voices - each demanding something else...

Id: [0x00055F5F]
It has been hard at times, but never harder than today. To see all I worked for - perverted, discarded, forgotten.

Id: [0x00055F61]
You would say I have described the whole of history, father. Are you smiling, then? Hoping I might speak the words you longed to hear? To validate you? To say that all along you were right?

Id: [0x00055F63]
I will not. Even now, faced as I am with the truth of your cold words, I refuse. Because I believe things can still change.

Id: [0x00055F64]
I may never succeed. The Assassins may struggle another thousand years in vain. But we will not stop.

Id: [0x00055F66]
Compromise. That is what everyone has insisted upon. And so I have learned it. But differently than most, I think.

Id: [0x00055F68]
I realize now that it will take time. That the road ahead is long and shrouded in darkness. It is a road that will not always take me where I wish to go - and I doubt I will live to see its end. But I will travel down it nonetheless.

Id: [0x00055F6A]
For at my side walks hope. In the face of all that insists I turn back, I carry on. This. This is my compromise.

Id: [0x00055F6F]
Used to be when people talked about the end of the world, we locked them up or laughed them off. Sometimes both. But we never took them seriously. [a beat]Maybe we should have.

Id: [0x00055F70]
But I'm getting ahead of myself. Better to start at the beginning - with the abduction of Desmond Miles. My son.

Id: [0x00055F71]
This‚Ä¶ boy had no ambition. No direction. No plans for the future. What he DID have was a heritage. One he chose to deny. It nearly cost him his life.

Id: [0x00055F72]
He was captured and imprisoned. Those who took him believed he could help them find something.

Id: [0x00055F73]
The Apple. One of several artifacts we call Pieces of Eden. Bits of ancient technology scattered across the globe. Some hidden. Some found. All of them dangerous. Most are held by a single group - the same group that now had Desmond.

Id: [0x00055F74]
You know them as Abstergo Industries. We know them as the Templars - as the enemy.

Id: [0x00055F75]
We've been fighting them for thousands of years. Even longer if you believe the stories of their origins. [a beat]I do. After all, I've seen the truth. That's the beauty - and the horror - of the Animus.

Id: [0x00055F76]
A device that allows us to enter and experience the lives of our ancestors. It holds the power to change everything. To show us history the way it really happened. Up until its creation - to the victor went the spoils - went the truth.

Id: [0x00055F77]
We're trying to fix that. To free minds and bodies both. But there's only so much we can do. And the Templars have the upper hand these days.

Id: [0x00055F78]
But something larger than the Assassins and Templars is approaching. Bigger than all of us. And if we can't find a way to stop it - these next few weeks will probably be our last. EVERYONE'S last.

Id: [0x00055F79]
In the end, it all comes down to him. To Desmond. Through the Animus he discovered his heritage. Explored the lives of his ancestors and uncovered their secrets.

Id: [0x00055F7A]
When that was done, he trained. He used another ancestor to provide decades of experience in the span of a few days. It worked. We think. We hope. Soon, though - soon we'll know. That ominous date fast approaches. December 21st, 2012. None of us knows what it'll bring - only that this is where they want us to be when it does.

Id: [0x00055F7B]
They've been guiding us, in their own fractured, frustrating way. These voices from The First Civilization, The Ones Who Came Before. A precursor race of immense power and uncertain motives. They're the ones who made the Pieces of Eden.

Id: [0x00055F7C]
This is where they've lead him. And through him, us. He stands at the entrance to this long-lost place, armed with the knowledge of Alta√Ør and the abilities of Ezio. He holds in his hand the Apple of Eden. And we stand at his side, ready to support him however we can.

Id: [0x00055F7D]
His name is Desmond Miles and he has brought us to the end.

Id: [0x00055F81]
We're here.

Id: [0x00055F84]
Let's go.

Id: [0x00055F92]
"In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again."

Id: [0x00055FA2]
I think we're... here.

Id: [0x00055FAE]
...the key...you must...find...the key...

Id: [0x00055FB0]
Son?

Id: [0x00055FB2]
Sir?

Id: [0x00055FB4]
Here we go again.

Id: [0x00055FB9]
Sir?.. Sir?.. Everything all right, sir?

Id: [0x00055FBA]
Yes, fine... I'm just preoccupied, that's all.

Id: [0x00055FBD]
Front of the opera house. And be quick about it. I don't expect to be here long.

Id: [0x00055FBE]
I'll bring her 'round at once.

Id: [0x00055FC0]
Yes, you do that...

Id: [0x00055FC4]
Desmond?

Id: [0x00055FC5]
Do you hear us?

Id: [0x00055FC6]
Yeah. What happened?

Id: [0x00055FC7]
The Temple triggered a bleeding effect. You collapsed and entered into a fugue state.

Id: [0x00055FC8]
So naturally you dropped me into the Animus instead of... I don't know... making sure I was okay?

Id: [0x00055FC9]
You weren't in any danger. Besides, the Temple appeared to be communicating with you, and I didn't want to risk severing the connection. At least not until we knew what it wanted.

Id: [0x00055FCA]
Right. Of course.

Id: [0x00055FCB]
Son, I...

Id: [0x00055FCC]
No it's fine. I get it. And I know what I'm looking for, by the way: It's a key. Just no idea where it is, though... Guess that's why she triggered the bleeding effect.

Id: [0x00055FCE]
Okay, Desmond. While you were, uh, visiting Constantinople, we picked up a software update for the Animus. I'd like to run a couple of quick tests - make sure there aren't any major issues.

Id: [0x00055FDE]
Synchronization levels look good now. We should be able to build the world. Time to find out what the temple wants from you.

Id: [0x00055FE3]
You all saw that, right?

Id: [0x00055FE4]
Wow.

Id: [0x00055FE5]
Wow, indeed.

Id: [0x00055FE7]
We might know what it looks like, but we're no closer to finding it. Desmond, you need to keep going.

Id: [0x00055FE9]
Hey, he's your ancestor too. Why don't you hop in the Animus?

Id: [0x00055FEC]
Really? That's your response? It's like dealing with a six year-old.

Id: [0x00055FEE]
You want to know what's wrong? I'm sick of being treated like I'm not even here! Desmond do this. Desmond do that. Desmond you better figure things out because the sun is going to turn us all to ash and I know I was really nice to you but actually I'm just another Templar plot-twists, and yes, I would like very much for you to be controlled by a magic space wizard so that you can murder me. So there's your answer. I'm sick of being a goddamn pawn. I thought it might be different with you. I mean, you're my FATHER but turns out you're no better than the fucking Templars!

Id: [0x00055FF0]
Don't you EVER equate me to those bastards again. You hear me? EVERYTHING I do - EVERYTHING I have DONE - has been for YOU. Maybe I pushed a little too hard? Asked a little too much? But try and remember exactly what's at stake here. You need to get it together kid. We're running out of time.

Id: [0x00055FF2]
Riiiight. That was unusual. Well I'm just going to pretend that this never happened and get back to bringing everyone up to speed on where we stand.

Id: [0x00055FF4]
The news isn't good. It appears this Temple is powered by a collection of um... well, I guess they're batteries. You found one on your way in. But there aren't any more. At least... not down here.

Id: [0x00055FF7]
Any idea on where we can find replacements?

Id: [0x00055FF8]
Not yet. So I intend to tiptoe into the Abstergo database. Now, if I can cross reference these particular devices with their database, then maybe we'll get lucky.

Id: [0x00055FF9]
See what you can do.

Id: [0x00055FFA]
Obviously. [a beat]Anyway, Desmond - you can either take a look around here or we can head back to the Animus.

Id: [0x0005601F]
What is wrong with you, Desmond?

Id: [0x00056024]
We walked these hallways once, just as you... Filled with careful optimism. We believed our end might be averted...

Id: [0x0005602A]
In the beginning, when we thought we could be saved, we sought to face the sun's wrath and contain it.

Id: [0x0005602C]
Four towers would be built - to pull her fury into this place and dispel it.

Id: [0x0005602E]
But even with all we knew... With all we had... It would take too long. A thousand years we could labor and still the work would not be done...

Id: [0x00056030]
The first tower was never completed, the project abandoned... We moved on.

Id: [0x00056032]
But while we labored on other endeavors, a few returned. They thought to automate the process... Metal might finish what flesh could not...

Id: [0x00056036]
If we could not meet the sun's cruel embrace... Perhaps we might rebuke it.

Id: [0x00056037]
Already we could generate the fields - to protect us in times of strife...

Id: [0x00056038]
But these were small and simple things. To replicate them on a scale the size of a world...

Id: [0x00056039]
We lacked the energy to make it so.

Id: [0x0005603A]
Half the world, they said, then. It is better than none at all. We tried. Again we failed. A quarter, they asked.

Id: [0x0005603B]
Even this we could not do... A sixth! An eighth! A tenth, they cried! The answer was still the same. Perhaps in time a city might be spared... But it was time we did not have... So we moved on.

Id: [0x00056043]
How wrong we were.

Id: [0x0005605F]
Position one!

Id: [0x00056243]
Dr. White is overwhelmed and needs some extra hands.

Id: [0x00056246]
I'm no doctor, Connor.

Id: [0x000562B3]
The convoy should be here soon. We'll attack on my signal.

Id: [0x000562BC]
Understood, sir.

Id: [0x000562C1]
Connor! There you are.

Id: [0x000562C3]
Connor! Connor!

Id: [0x000562C7]
I've collected these kegs. I might suggest building an ambush in the event we need it. They'll likely outnumber us at least 2 to 1.

Id: [0x000562CA]
I have laid a trap should things sour. Come, let us ready for our guests.

Id: [0x000562CE]
If we time this right, we can catch them all unawares...

Id: [0x000562D0]
The hell is this?

Id: [0x000562D1]
A thousand pardons, sirs - seems we've 'ad ourselves an unhappy little accident.

Id: [0x000562D2]
Get it sorted - and quickly.

Id: [0x000562D3]
Course, m'lord. At once.

Id: [0x000562D5]
Hurry up, now!

Id: [0x000562D6]
[effort]We're tryin!

Id: [0x000562D8]
My patience is wearing thin...

Id: [0x000562D9]
[effort]Doin' the best we can, sir.

Id: [0x000562DB]
Look - either get your cart upright or we're riding through it.

Id: [0x000562DC]
[effort]Please, don't! We're nearly finished.

Id: [0x000562DE]
Alright that's it!

Id: [0x000562E0]
Oi 'aytham! It's now or never!

Id: [0x000562E4]
We're here to help you - along with those held inside Southgate Fort.

Id: [0x000562E6]
Free me.

Id: [0x000562E7]
Not until we're inside the gate. I can't chance an inspection at the gate going wrong.

Id: [0x000562E9]
I'll see you safe. You have my word.

Id: [0x000562F0]
Dammit! They've dogs! Those creatures will smell the corpses. We can't let them near us!

Id: [0x000562F1]
Give the word, sir - and I'll deal with this.

Id: [0x000562FA]
Hold!

Id: [0x000562FC]
Evening gentlemen.

Id: [0x000562FD]
State your business.

Id: [0x000562FF]
Delivery for Silas.

Id: [0x00056300]
Go on, then.

Id: [0x00056307]
Do you know anything of Silas' operation? How many men we might expect? The nature of their defenses?

Id: [0x00056309]
You must be rather important to him if you were given your own escort...

Id: [0x0005630B]
I wish you'd trust us... Though I suppose it's only natural for you to be wary. So be it.

Id: [0x0005630D]
See? I'm freeing you just as I said I would. Now if you'll allow me to explain-

Id: [0x0005630F]
Let her go.

Id: [0x00056310]
But she'll give us away.

Id: [0x00056311]
No she won't.

Id: [0x00056313]
What's the plan?

Id: [0x00056314]
Free the captives and avoid detection.

Id: [0x00056315]
What of Silas?

Id: [0x00056316]
He dies.

Id: [0x0005633D]
Connor, I'm sorry. For bringing this violence on the village.

Id: [0x00056340]
We protect our own. The British will not risk losing more soldiers for one deserter. You are free of it now.

Id: [0x00056346]
Get off me, baptesme! (baptism!)

Id: [0x00056348]
You just watch me take a beating?!

Id: [0x0005634A]
A little help?! S'il vous plait?! (Please?!)

Id: [0x00056388]
Would you look at that...

Id: [0x00056389]
What is it?

Id: [0x0005638A]
If I had to guess, I would say it's a counter. And judging from the iconography, I think it's safe to say when that's emptied [he points to the first circle]... the end begins.

Id: [0x00056405]
Good- it may not be there as the house where it was stored lay in the path of the great fire. If so, worry not.

Id: [0x0005640C]
Let's see if our man can fly!

Id: [0x0005640E]
No! No! Ahhh!

Id: [0x00056410]
Please!? Help? Me?

Id: [0x00056412]
Thank you. Thank you.

Id: [0x00056416]
Silly really, my tools and equipment WERE worth a king's share to the right man. In any case, I best get on my way, it's a long walk to the nearest inn. I thank you again for your kindness.

Id: [0x00056418]
Ow!

Id: [0x0005641A]
Help! Somebody please help me!

Id: [0x0005641C]
Prudence! Are you alright? What are you doing out here in the woods?!

Id: [0x0005641D]
Connor! Thank goodness. The baby's coming!

Id: [0x0005641E]
We need to get you to Dr. White.

Id: [0x0005641F]
No! I can't move! Take my horse! Bring him here. GO!

Id: [0x00056425]
Dr. White! Come with me. Now.

Id: [0x00056426]
What's wrong?

Id: [0x00056427]
Prudence is in labor in the forest.

Id: [0x00056429]
In the forest? What in bloody hell is she doing out there?!

Id: [0x0005642A]
Does not matter.

Id: [0x0005642E]
Hello Dr. I think I can manage at the moment...

Id: [0x00056437]
Warren! Are you here!?

Id: [0x00056439]
Over here. What's the trouble? [realizing]Where is she?!

Id: [0x00056443]
No, she's not alright she's having a baby and HERE by the looks of it.

Id: [0x000564C5]
I thought it might bring clarity. Or instill a sense of accomplishment. But all I feel is regret.

Id: [0x000564C6]
Hold fast to that. Such sacrifices must never come lightly.

Id: [0x000564C7]
I had to do it. Not only for my people, but for all the others Johnson would have harmed.

Id: [0x000564CB]
It's a start. But to truly be free of Templar influence, all of them must be dealt with in turn. [a beat]Even your father.

Id: [0x000564CC]
I know.

Id: [0x000564CD]
You speak the words, but do you believe them?

Id: [0x000564D1]
How fares the hunt, Connor?

Id: [0x000564D3]
There is progress, but I worry it is not enough.

Id: [0x000564DE]
You must strike where you‚Äôre needed most. What if you pursued Charles Lee and your father - what then of Paul Revere? And the soldiers at Lexington ?

Id: [0x000564DF]
Soldiers? There were no soldiers in those towns - only men and women who were forced to defend themselves.

Id: [0x000564E0]
Is this not why you fight? To protect your people? [a beat]Your struggle is the colonist's struggle. In helping one, you help the other.

Id: [0x000564E2]
Encouraging words from one who thought mine a fool's errand.

Id: [0x000564E4]
Make no mistake - I still do. But I can‚Äôt help but feel some pride in your success.

Id: [0x000564E5]
And why should I give you any credit?

Id: [0x000564E7]
Then don't. But first, return the robe. And the blades. And the darts. And all of the years of training and knowledge I have bestowed upon you. Return these and then your words may have some merit.

Id: [0x000564E9]
Or you could just admit that you were wrong.

Id: [0x000564EB]
Oh child, please. You‚Äôve killed two men - one more salesman than soldier. You‚Äôre gonna have to try a lot harder than that to impress me.

Id: [0x000564F6]
Myriam is interesting.

Id: [0x000564F7]
Certainly not your typical colonial woman. A deadly shot.

Id: [0x000564F8]
She brought down that cougar! She is strong. Capable. She has no husband?

Id: [0x000564F9]
Not that I am aware of.

Id: [0x000564FA]
I never met a woman like her before. I would like to know her better.

Id: [0x000564FB]
You should speak to her then.

Id: [0x000564FC]
Hey! Don't splash, don't want to get the powder wet. Do you think she likes French men?

Id: [0x000564FD]
She may. I cannot speak to her tastes.

Id: [0x00056501]
We are sworn to stop them. Or have you forgotten?

Id: [0x00056507]
Haytham may listen. But will he understand? And even if he does, will he agree?

Id: [0x0005659B]
I knew Myriam was not the type for flowers.

Id: [0x0005659D]
We need to get Warren.

Id: [0x0005659E]
Now?!

Id: [0x0005659F]
Yes!

Id: [0x000565B4]
One of the many plans given to us by Shao Jun to -

Id: [0x000565B6]
Hmmm. We'll have to work on this.

Id: [0x000565C7]
Come on. We need to get that arm looked at.

Id: [0x000565C8]
What of the men who did this?

Id: [0x000565C9]
They can wait. Your wound cannot.

Id: [0x000565CD]
Are you alright?

Id: [0x000565CF]
What do you think?  [pain grunt]

Id: [0x000565D4]
Connor! What are you doing?!

Id: [0x000565D5]
Those poachers need to be stopped.

Id: [0x000565D6]
Use the rope dart if you can. Get familiar with it.

Id: [0x000565DD]
Have a taste of my boot, Frenchie.

Id: [0x000565DF]
That feel nice, soap dodger?

Id: [0x000565E1]
Ah! Go back to where you came from!

Id: [0x000565E4]
Connor! Ellen's dullard of a man is trying to break down her door with his mates! We're on our way stop it!

Id: [0x000565EA]
Hey! Connor! Hey!

Id: [0x000565EF]
Connor!

Id: [0x000565F0]
I am no lord and these are my friends, not my townsfolk. What brings you to the road with a cart full of spirits for sale?

Id: [0x000565F4]
Hey, you should settle here. We could use an inn. Oup!

Id: [0x000565F6]
We would! But without the inn itself we don't have much choice and building one isn't cheap.

Id: [0x000565F8]
[Ai√°:wen‚Äôs ne Iah Tehak√≥nhsare aontahi√°:ion ne sk√©n:nen sesakonh√°tie.]May the Faceless One grant you the peace you claimed to seek.

Id: [0x00056674]
Do you know where he is?

Id: [0x00056675]
Not exactly. But I have an idea where we can begin the search.

Id: [0x00056678]
There are rumors of bad bills being circulated here. No doubt they come from Thomas.

Id: [0x0005667A]
What are up to? This isn't money! It's colored paper. You've cheated me for the last time! GUARDS!

Id: [0x0005667E]
You should tail him, Connor. See where he goes.

Id: [0x0005668B]
Oi, Daniel - best put them bills away. The guards is on to us.

Id: [0x0005668F]
How? What happened?

Id: [0x00056690]
Damn shopkeep called me out! Brought the guards, but I gave 'em the slip.

Id: [0x00056691]
Boss is gonna be mad.

Id: [0x00056692]
Not so mad as if I'd gotten caught. 'Sides, we've got most everything we need for the job now, anyway.

Id: [0x00056693]
Best go tell him. I'll warn the others.

Id: [0x00056695]
I heard what happened at the market. Boss wants everyone back at the shop. Says we strike tonight.

Id: [0x00056696]
He worried about that business with the guards? I'm telling you it's nothing. Haven't had a spot of trouble since I slipped away. Course, I'm takin' care to keep my distance.

Id: [0x00056697]
Can't believe we're really gonna do this.

Id: [0x00056698]
We'll be heroes. The ones who ended all this talk of revolution. They'll set us up like kings, they will.

Id: [0x0005669B]
Hmph! Revolution. Bunch a' trouble makers lookin' to upset the apple-cart cos some fool filled their heads with rubbish. Ruinin' it for the rest of us good folk.

Id: [0x0005669C]
Good folk? Really?

Id: [0x0005669D]
Of course! You and me and Hickey? Just some hard-luck lads tryin' to survive in this cold, cruel world.

Id: [0x000566A2]
There's another one! Grab 'im!

Id: [0x000566AA]
You get away from there! That's MY money.

Id: [0x000566AB]
Touch those bills and I'll kill you!

Id: [0x000566AC]
Hands off! I seen it first!

Id: [0x000566AD]
Any closer and I'll cut you! I mean it!

Id: [0x000566AE]
Mine! All mine!

Id: [0x000566B4]
Quiet in there!

Id: [0x000566B6]
I said knock it off!

Id: [0x000566B8]
Keep that up and I'll have you tossed in the pit.

Id: [0x000566C1]
I said quiet!

Id: [0x000566C4]
They clearly spared no expense here...

Id: [0x000566C6]
That is quite the view...

Id: [0x000566CA]
I hope that is not meant to be my meal...

Id: [0x000566CC]
Smells even worse than it looks...

Id: [0x000566CE]
Hmmm. I think I would rather hold it in.

Id: [0x000566D0]
... I'm tellin' ya, he's plannin' to escape. We should get in on it!

Id: [0x000566D1]
Probably just a shiv.

Id: [0x000566D2]
Nah. Mason ain't a fighter. Always talkin' and trickin' 'is way outta trouble. Weasel Weems, they call 'im. Sneaky bastard.

Id: [0x000566D3]
Come on, Finch. He's not so bad. Even taught me some letters once. Gonna write a note to my lady.

Id: [0x000566D4]
[Laughs]What for? You think that whore's out there pinin' for ya? Savin herself for when you get out? Hah! No doubt she's already moved onto the next fella. And the fella after 'im.

Id: [0x000566D5]
You shut your mouth, 'fore I shut it for you.

Id: [0x000566D6]
Easy now - was just a joke.

Id: [0x000566D7]
Yeah? Well it wasn't very funny...

Id: [0x000566DD]
Get up.

Id: [0x000566DE]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x000566E2]
Yeah? And what makes ya think that?

Id: [0x000566E3]
Caught 'im carvin' something in the yard. Slipped it in his pocket real quick when 'e saw me. Looked like a key.

Id: [0x000566EB]
I should try and find this Weems fellow. If he intends to escape, perhaps he can help me.

Id: [0x000566ED]
Stay out of trouble or you'll wind up in the pit.

Id: [0x000566EE]
What are you lookin' at half-breed?

Id: [0x000566F0]
Get outta here.

Id: [0x000566F2]
You not hear me the first time?

Id: [0x000566F4]
Last warning, little man.

Id: [0x000566F6]
Please don't hurt me.

Id: [0x000566F8]
Just... go away.

Id: [0x000566F9]
You not understand English? That it?

Id: [0x000566FB]
Do I need to knock some sense into that thick head of yours?

Id: [0x000566FE]
Leave me alone or I'll call the guard!

Id: [0x00056700]
Help! Guards!

Id: [0x00056714]
He won't. That's why we're targetting him.

Id: [0x00056722]
Well that didn't turn out so well, now did it?

Id: [0x00056723]
Sorry. I will not make the same mistake a second time.

Id: [0x00056724]
See that you don't or we'll never make it out of here.

Id: [0x00056726]
Alright scoundrels, back in your cells!

Id: [0x0005672A]
This key is useless!

Id: [0x0005672C]
What are you looking at?

Id: [0x00056735]
Your key is useless.

Id: [0x00056736]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00056737]
It did not fit the lock.

Id: [0x00056739]
It's not meant to.

Id: [0x0005673B]
Yes... This next part you may not like.

Id: [0x0005673C]
You forged a key that does not work?

Id: [0x0005673D]
Well that all depends on what you mean by work. It'll get us out of here, just not the way you expected.

Id: [0x0005673E]
Then how?

Id: [0x00056741]
Why not just have me take the real key? Why all this extra work?

Id: [0x00056742]
He might notice if it went missing. This way, he'll be none the wiser.

Id: [0x00056743]
And when HE tries to use it?

Id: [0x00056746]
How do I reach the warden?

Id: [0x00056747]
You need to pick a fight.

Id: [0x00056748]
What?

Id: [0x00056749]
Pick a fight and they'll throw you in the pit.

Id: [0x0005674A]
How in the world does this help us?

Id: [0x0005674B]
The warden oversees the pit. Getting sent there is the only way to reach him.

Id: [0x0005674F]
Take down as many as you can. One or two will only serve to entertain the guards. You need to make them angry.

Id: [0x00056755]
Fancy yourself a trouble-maker, eh? Some time in the pit should cool your blood.

Id: [0x00056776]
Wot are we gonna do?

Id: [0x00056779]
Do tell.

Id: [0x0005677D]
'E's here. They put 'im in the cell next to mine. Guess we didn‚Äôt quite get ‚Äòem all, eh?

Id: [0x0005677F]
At once, sir.

Id: [0x00056782]
You‚Äôre that boy from the Continental Congress. Adams' little lap dog. [a long beat as he studies Connor]Hmmm. I think I have an idea... Yes. Two birds with one stone.

Id: [0x00056783]
All in good time. It‚Äôs not like the Assassin‚Äôs going anywhere. For now we should see about getting you better accommodations here.

Id: [0x00056784]
What are you on about? I thought I was getting‚Äô out.

Id: [0x00056785]
I‚Äôm afraid you won‚Äôt be leaving for a while, thanks to Benjamin Tallmadge. He‚Äôs been running his mouth, saying all sorts of things. You‚Äôre being investigated for plotting to assassinate George Washington.

Id: [0x00056786]
What a bunch of bollocks! I thought you was gonna handle that.

Id: [0x00056787]
We'll discuss this ELSEWHERE.

Id: [0x000567CB]
You're going to use it to get the real key off the warden. You have to swap yours for his.

Id: [0x000567CC]
As if I‚Äôve liked the others? [a beat]Out with it.

Id: [0x000567CE]
I'll give you credit... You've given this plan to risk my life a great deal of thought...

Id: [0x000567E6]
Look at all of you. Pathetic, dirty wretches. You're naught but swine, suckling at the teats of civilization. Thieves and scoundrels, all. And do you acknowledge this? Do you repent and beg forgiveness? No. You elect, instead, to commit new and more terrible crimes inside what should be a place of rehabilitation.

Id: [0x0005680C]
What have we here?

Id: [0x0005680E]
I thought we'd finished off your kind.

Id: [0x00056811]
Please. The man is weak. He stumbles and stammers through each engagement, making it up as he goes along. His pedigree is pathetic - his military record even more so. I could go on and on but we'd be here for days, so manifold are his faults, so deficient are his merits. He must be dealt with. You as well. I will abide no more flies in the ointment.

Id: [0x00056813]
'Ere is 'ow it's gonna work. First we bind ya and bring ya to your cell. Then, tomorrow, you go before the court, accused of plottin' to kill good ol' Georgie. Maybe we could pin the murder of the Warden on you too. You did kill ‚Äòim, after all. And who wouldn't take the word of Charlie over here? Once that‚Äôs all squared away, well then... [laugh]

Id: [0x00056817]
All those years ago... The child in the forest was YOU.

Id: [0x00056819]
Ah, but what's done is done.

Id: [0x00056831]
You‚Äôll find Hickey through that door. It‚Äôs where they keep the ‚Äúimportant‚Äù prisoners. Nicer rooms, more space - those sorts of things. It seems even in prison, who you know makes all the difference.

Id: [0x00056832]
Thank you, Mason ‚Äì for everything. I will find a way to repay the favor when my work here is finished.

Id: [0x0005683C]
I need to take care not to raise the alarm.

Id: [0x00056847]
Not who you was expectin', am I right?

Id: [0x0005697D]
Our destination is just up ahead.

Id: [0x0005697F]
Hmmm. No. Turn around. Where we want to go is behind us.

Id: [0x00056980]
Left.

Id: [0x00056983]
Turn right.

Id: [0x00056985]
Excellent! We are right on course.

Id: [0x00056987]
Nearly there, Connor.

Id: [0x00056989]
Always swift and sure - I like that about you, Connor.

Id: [0x0005698B]
Yes, this is exactly where we need to be!

Id: [0x0005698D]
Keep going Connor. We're almost there.

Id: [0x0005698F]
Turn back Connor - you're going the wrong way.

Id: [0x00056994]
Spread the word! The Regulars are coming out.

Id: [0x00056997]
This is it. You have got the right place.

Id: [0x00056999]
No. Wrong place.

Id: [0x0005699B]
Not here, Connor.

Id: [0x0005699F]
At once!

Id: [0x000569A1]
Back in the saddle, my friend. We have more people to warn.

Id: [0x000569A3]
Redcoats! What are they doing here?

Id: [0x000569A4]
They must be scouts.

Id: [0x000569A5]
Be careful Connor. We musn't let them warn the others!

Id: [0x000569AB]
The regulars are coming!

Id: [0x000569AC]
Here. WE'RE HERE

Id: [0x000569AE]
GET THEM!

Id: [0x000569B4]
That was much too close for comfort. Let us take care to avoid any further surprises...

Id: [0x000569B6]
Be on the lookout for Redcoats...

Id: [0x000569B8]
Careful Connor, there might be other scouts around...

Id: [0x000569BA]
Wouldn't surprise me if we ran into more trouble... Stay alert.

Id: [0x000569BC]
Did you hear that? Could be Redcoats. Careful.

Id: [0x000569BE]
Quick - hide!

Id: [0x000569C0]
We can't afford to be discovered, Connor! Hide!

Id: [0x000569C2]
If we're discovered, we're ruined. Find cover!

Id: [0x000569C5]
Find a place to hide, Connor! Quickly! Before we're spotted!

Id: [0x000569C7]
We need to lose them!

Id: [0x000569C9]
We've got to shake those Redcoats!

Id: [0x000569CB]
Faster! We need to get away from them!

Id: [0x000569CE]
Well - I suppose that's one way to deal with the situation.

Id: [0x000569D0]
If you insist on fighting them Connor - ensure you win!

Id: [0x000569D2]
Hmm. Turning the tables, are you?

Id: [0x000569D4]
Well - I suppose this gives you the element of surprise.

Id: [0x000569D6]
Make sure none of them get away!

Id: [0x000569D8]
Find a way to get rid of them, Connor!

Id: [0x000569DA]
Uh, Connor?

Id: [0x000569DC]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x000569DE]
We will never finish in time if we go by foot.

Id: [0x000569E0]
Get back on the horse, Connor.

Id: [0x000569E2]
Is everything alright, my friend?

Id: [0x00057395]
You need to get to Concord and warn the others.

Id: [0x00057399]
Go on now.

Id: [0x0005739E]
When the fighting starts, we'll need to hold those positions there. They're critical to the defense of Concord.

Id: [0x000573A1]
Good boys, not used to soldiering. They need someone with experience to direct 'em. That something you can do?

Id: [0x000573A3]
You'd best be telling the truth.

Id: [0x000573A4]
Then I suppose all that's left to do is wait...

Id: [0x0005751C]
Ah! Connor.

Id: [0x0005751D]
You.

Id: [0x0005751E]
Oh?

Id: [0x00057520]
Would you excuse us fellows?

Id: [0x00057522]
I was hoping you could help me locate William Johnson.

Id: [0x00057523]
Look, sanctions and demonstrations won't suffice, Sam. We need to ACT. And I'm talking about more than a sternly worded letter.

Id: [0x00057524]
I sympathize with your frustrations, gentlemen. But surely you can understand my reluctance to kick the hornet's nest.

Id: [0x00057525]
The Tories sting no matter what we do. Might as well make it count.

Id: [0x0005752D]
Thank you. That conversation was about to turn unpleasant. Now, what can I do for you?

Id: [0x0005752E]
Of course. I'm headed to a meeting with some men who should be able to help. Why don't you come along?

Id: [0x00057536]
It's good to see the people finally taking a stand against injustice...

Id: [0x00057538]
Says the man who owns a slave.

Id: [0x0005753A]
It's in turns or not at all. We must compromise Connor, however painful that may be. Try and solve all the world's problems at the same time and you'll wind up solving none at all.

Id: [0x00057569]
What happens now?

Id: [0x0005756A]
We wait for the signal.

Id: [0x0005756B]
What signal?

Id: [0x0005756F]
Evening gentlemen. Shall we be off?

Id: [0x00057570]
No.

Id: [0x00057571]
Of course. [a beat]First, we make our way to Nathaniel Bradlee's house to fetch the rest of our little group. Then it's on to Griffin's Wharf, where we board the ships and dump the tea. Simple as that.

Id: [0x000575A3]
Dammit! More guards!

Id: [0x000575A5]
We need to turn the crowd's anger to our advantage.

Id: [0x000575A6]
Say the word Connor and I will make it so!

Id: [0x000575A8]
On me, friends! Let us send these lobsters back into the sea!

Id: [0x000575AA]
That Chapheau fellow is quite the firebrand.

Id: [0x000575B2]
(Whistle)

Id: [0x000575BA]
We've done it!

Id: [0x000575C0]
Connor! [a beat as he gestures]We saved the last one for you.

Id: [0x000575C2]
Best we get out of here, eh?

Id: [0x000575C7]
Please, you have to stop him.

Id: [0x000575D0]
I should return to Kanen't√≥:kon...

Id: [0x000575D3]
Ah! Thought you might send one of your own to oppose me? An unwise decision, as you'll now learn!

Id: [0x000575D5]
Call off your dog or everyone dies!

Id: [0x000575E9]
William Johnson's openin' up some of that Mohawk land he purchased for free huntin' soon. Might be we make a good haul up there.

Id: [0x000575EA]
I hear tell lumberin'll be allowed to boot.

Id: [0x000575EB]
What does he want with the territory if not the game and timber?

Id: [0x000575EC]
Don't know. Don't much care, neither. Beats skulking around these woods. Something don't feel right.

Id: [0x000575EE]
Somebody's in the trees!

Id: [0x000575F0]
Who's there?!

Id: [0x000575F2]
There's someone followin' us!

Id: [0x000575F5]
Hey! Where are you fellas?

Id: [0x000575F8]
Shooting strangers in the forest? Is that common hunting practice where you come from?

Id: [0x000575F9]
N-no. I..

Id: [0x000575FA]
Spare me! Go! Tell the friends you have left what happened here.

Id: [0x00057601]
Feelin' a bit guilty on account of that woman you put a hole in?

Id: [0x00057602]
Nah nah- she had it comin'.

Id: [0x00057603]
What's she dressed like that for anyway? It's not natural.

Id: [0x0005760A]
Hey, it's my home no matter what you thieves called 'taxmen' say! If the gumps in Parliament who want my property, you tell them to sail across the pond and take it themselves!

Id: [0x0005760B]
It's not open for discussion! Now open this door or these men will break it down!

Id: [0x0005760E]
Continue on, I shall meet you at our destination.

Id: [0x00057610]
Bollocks! We're coming in!

Id: [0x00057617]
You can't take what's not yours!

Id: [0x00057619]
Arrrg!

Id: [0x0005761B]
Come on, you lobsterbacks!

Id: [0x0005761D]
Ouf!

Id: [0x0005761F]
Is that all you have?!

Id: [0x00057621]
Ah! Could use some support!

Id: [0x00057623]
Justice for once. I dare the Governor to send more. (spits)

Id: [0x00057624]
You alright?

Id: [0x00057625]
I'm fine. It's not my first dance. For all their teeth and claws these little foxes, they fight like puppies. Thank you, my friend. I said I‚Äôd buy you an ale but I'm expected somewhere else.

Id: [0x0005762A]
Connor! I'd like you to meet some like-minded friends. The owner of this fine establishment, William Molineux and the manager and chef of his newest venture, Stephane Chapheau.

Id: [0x0005762C]
Ah, Connor and I just had a ball with some Redcoats enforcing some taxmen outside my home!

Id: [0x0005762F]
The collectors grow bolder and more forceful. Something we must address, Samuel.

Id: [0x00057630]
Then let us raise a banner. Something to let the people know that they are not alone. The docks are an angry place of late, protesters picketing the latest shipments of British tea. The eyes of the city are upon that stage...

Id: [0x00057632]
William Johnson is smuggling the tea off the ships- one of his men tried to sell me this.

Id: [0x00057633]
Where is he now?

Id: [0x00057636]
He intends to purchase the land upon which my village stands without the consent of my people.

Id: [0x00057637]
No doubt the revenue from his little smuggling endeavor is financing the acquisition.

Id: [0x00057639]
A tax enforced on tea grants a boon to smugglers. I'll wager the same men who levy the taxes are selling the tea. [beat]A stage requires a spectacle and I may know the play.

Id: [0x0005766C]
A sample of what I refused, but it's from those ships- no mistaking the stamp. He's charging a King's ransom, must be he's making a mint off those who buy it.

Id: [0x0005768A]
Stephane, what is wrong? Where is Sam Adams?

Id: [0x0005768B]
Who cares! I've been robbed! Ils vont me le payer ces sc√©l√©rats de merde... (Those scoundrels are going to pay...)

Id: [0x00057696]
You looking for a fight, Englishman!? I'll give you what you want!

Id: [0x00057698]
Oh! Regardez! (Look!) Some pathetic Redcoats waiting for a beating!

Id: [0x0005769A]
I will match your face to your jacket, crapule! (Bastard!)

Id: [0x000576B4]
The people seem to have an ear for you. What of the things you lost?

Id: [0x000576B5]
The people listened to me only because I spoke the truth loud enough, which is worth one thousand times the contents of my footlocker. The English, they can keep my THINGS.

Id: [0x000576D4]
A Bostonian without his tea is a dangerous beast!

Id: [0x000576EF]
Did you really think we wouldn't come looking for you?

Id: [0x000576F1]
Call yourself a soldier?

Id: [0x000576FD]
Get back! I'll put a ball all through his temple!

Id: [0x000576FF]
Yield! Or your friend dies!

Id: [0x00057701]
Enough! I have him! Back off!

Id: [0x0005770A]
Are you hurt?

Id: [0x0005770C]
Nothing that won't mend. Thank you, stranger.

Id: [0x0005770D]
What were they doing?

Id: [0x0005770E]
This lot was dragging me through the countryside trying to make an example of a deserter... sorry now, who are you?

Id: [0x00057712]
Good idea! [laugh]

Id: [0x00057713]
Connor. A deserter you say?

Id: [0x00057714]
Don't much agree with the fight and I love this country so there you have it. Name's David Walston- my friends call me Big Dave. Might I ask where you live so I could repay the debt when I'm able? Might take us a while, us smithies don't earn much coin these days.

Id: [0x00057719]
Our community is not far from here and we certainly could use the services of a smith. Would you consider plying your trade there?

Id: [0x0005771A]
Well, would make repaying you a spot easier. I just might!

Id: [0x0005771C]
Well, then we should find one.

Id: [0x00057733]
Dr. White?

Id: [0x00057734]
Yes.

Id: [0x00057735]
My name is Connor.

Id: [0x00057736]
And what can I help you with? Another quote for the broadsheets for you to twist against me?

Id: [0x00057737]
I am here to make you an offer.

Id: [0x00057738]
Don't you know who I am? I'm the doctor the British have been slandering all over town. "White Death"? No?

Id: [0x0005773E]
I was given your name by my friends Warren and Prudence. Prudence is with child and requires a doctor's hand.

Id: [0x0005773F]
Prudence is PREGNANT!? Ha! They have been trying for years it seems. Maybe getting away from Boston is exactly what I need.

Id: [0x00057745]
Excuse me. Might I impose upon the kindness in your heart to give bed and board to a weary traveler?

Id: [0x00057746]
Oh, Traveler from where?

Id: [0x00057747]
Across an ocean. London.

Id: [0x00057748]
English? Ha ha ha!

Id: [0x00057749]
A great kindness. Bless you.

Id: [0x0005774A]
We work hard for what we have here, old man. What is it you do exactly?

Id: [0x0005774B]
I wish to provide God for those who seek His salvation, not spoon feed His word to those who already have their own. An outlook not shared by the Monarchy.

Id: [0x0005774C]
Ollie and I have been missing our Sunday mass.

Id: [0x0005774D]
I'd like Maria to read the bible. I'm sure if we all pitched in we could build a church. If you'd be our pastor. Connor?

Id: [0x0005774E]
...Lord knows some of us have things to confess...

Id: [0x0005774F]
Father. Father Timothy.

Id: [0x0005775A]
You may kiss your bride.

Id: [0x0005775F]
William Johnson has returned - with all the money required to buy our land. He meets with the elders as we speak. I have begged them to resist. But I fear he shall have his way unless you intervene.

Id: [0x00057760]
How is this possible? We destroyed the tea.

Id: [0x00057763]
Can you tell me where they are meeting?

Id: [0x00057766]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0005776B]
[√çsi‚Äô na‚Äôkaniatar√°:ti tkan√≥nhsote ne Johnson Tsi Iontia‚Äôtarohr√≥kstha.]Johnson Hall is just across the river.

Id: [0x0005776C]
Of course.

Id: [0x0005776E]
[Kwah √≠:ken tsi wathnekan√≥nhnha, Ratonhnhak√©:ton.]The water is well guarded, Ratonhnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x00057776]

Id: [0x0005779F]
Quiet.

Id: [0x000577A1]
From what I've seen its fur is white- mad as it sounds. Its hide would be worth a fortune to the right person.

Id: [0x000577AF]
I could use your help. Suis-moi. (Follow me.)

Id: [0x000577CC]
What do we do?

Id: [0x000577CD]
Create a window.

Id: [0x000577E6]
[hmm]No doubt. I had best prepare some things myself.

Id: [0x000577EB]
Sacredieu! (shit!) I think they are coming.

Id: [0x000577F5]
Where are you going?!

Id: [0x000577F7]
You're wrong! The time has come for us to HIT BACK! They have no right to tell us how to live! To take our money and take our things with no REASON! I am angry! BOSTON is angry! Let our anger be heard! And if they won't listen, we'll open their heads and shout it in!

Id: [0x000577FA]
We are not English! We are not the King's men! We are free! But the King sends these REDCOATS to push us around! They are NOT our MASTERS! This is our city! Let's show them who owns it! It's time to FIGHT!

Id: [0x00057801]
To get back what's rightfully mine!

Id: [0x00057802]
There is a way to fight injustice! But THIS is not it!

Id: [0x00057807]
Quickly, Connor! Get on the horse.

Id: [0x00057810]
The British are coming!

Id: [0x00057A47]
We all have our part to play. Try not to die.

Id: [0x00057A55]
You bide your time, awaiting the day of release, that you might corrupt anew. The worst part is that the good people of New York are forced ‚Äì quite literally ‚Äì to pay for your crimes.

Id: [0x00057A56]
Where do you think the money for this prison came from? Hmm? For your outfits? Our wages?

Id: [0x00057A57]
Ah, but it seems our current leaders lack the courage to accept this truth. So you are spared, that you might leech awhile longer. And if a few of you might die or go missing, who will notice? Who will care? And why should they? You are wasted on the world.

Id: [0x00057A58]
Mark my words, the time fast approaches when such weakness will no longer be tolerated. And what a joyous day that will be...

Id: [0x00057A59]
Resources wasted because you refuse to contribute to society. You would rather dwell at its margins, living off the hard work of others. We'd be doing everyone a favor if we simply put you all down. Then our money might be spent on more productive things.

Id: [0x00057D85]
Up! Up with ya!

Id: [0x00057D88]
I said GET UP!

Id: [0x00057D8A]
Walk.

Id: [0x00057D8F]
'Ello Connor. Didn't think I'd miss your goin' away party, did ya? I hear Washington 'imself will be in attendance. Hope nuttin' bad 'appens to him.

Id: [0x00057D90]
You said there'd be a trial!

Id: [0x00057D91]
Ah no trials for Traitors, I'm afraid. Lee an' Haytham saw to that. It's straight to the gallows for you!

Id: [0x00057D92]
I will not die today. The same cannot be said for you.

Id: [0x00057D94]
That's enough! Keep moving!

Id: [0x00057D97]
[whistles]

Id: [0x00057D98]
Bye now!

Id: [0x00057DA0]
You are not alone. Only give a cry when you need us...

Id: [0x00057DA1]
Forget about me - you need to stop Hickey. He's -

Id: [0x00057DA3]
Up ya go! Don't wanna be late, now do we?

Id: [0x00057DA5]
Ya just had to be a hero, din't ya? You and Georgie both. Now you'll see what it gets ya: a pine box and l'il else.

Id: [0x00057DAA]
Brothers. Sisters. Fellow Patriots. Several days ago we learned of a scheme so vile, so dastardly - that even repeating it now, disturbs my being. The man before you plotted to murder our much beloved General.

Id: [0x00057DAC]
Indeed. What darkness or madness moved him, none can say. And he himself offers no defense. Shows no remorse. And though we have begged and pleaded with him to share what he knows, he maintains a deadly silence.

Id: [0x00057DAE]
May God have mercy on your soul.

Id: [0x00057DB5]
Need... to stop Hickey...

Id: [0x00057DB7]
Go!

Id: [0x00057DC3]
Dammit. I thought I'd at least live to see another day. Shame.

Id: [0x00057DC5]
How should I know? The Templars. Lee. The big man, Haytham. They 'as the money. They 'as the power. That's the reason I threw in with 'em. That's the ONLY reason. Sure, they 'ave some sort of vision, for the future too. I didn't give a damn about any of that. They can sing their songs about mankind and it's troubles. They can make their plans and spring their traps, don't bother me none. They paid me so I said yes. Didn't bother to ask who or how or why. Didn't care.

Id: [0x00057DC8]
You chose to side with men who would rob us of our humanity simply because it was more profitable?

Id: [0x00057DC9]
Wot else is there? I'm not some blind fool who'd give up all I've got on principle. What IS principle anyway? Can ya bring it to the bank?

Id: [0x00057DCB]
Don't look at me like that. We're different, you and I! You're just some blind fool who's always chasin' butterflies. Where as I'm a type of guy who likes to have a beer in one hand and a titty in the other. Thing is, boy, I can have what I seek. Had it, even. You? Your hands will always be empty.

Id: [0x00057DD2]
At ease, men! At ease!

Id: [0x00057DD4]
I said lower your god-damned guns! This man's a hero!

Id: [0x00057DD6]
The General can be so stubborn sometimes. Piffle, he said, when we warned him something like this would happen! Piffle!

Id: [0x00057DD8]
Stop.

Id: [0x00057DD9]
He wanted to kill the Commander. Nearly killed you as well. He was a scoundrel.

Id: [0x00057DDA]
But still a man.

Id: [0x00057DDC]
Hmph. You're nothing, if not consistent.

Id: [0x00057DDE]
Where is Washington? I need to speak with him.

Id: [0x00057DE0]
Bundled off as soon as your execution went sideways. He's likely on his way back to Philadelphia by now.

Id: [0x00057DE1]
Then so am I.

Id: [0x00057DE3]
Something wrong?

Id: [0x00057DE4]
He is still in danger. Hickey did not act alone...

Id: [0x00057DF3]
If the man will not explain himself - if he will not confess and atone - what other option do we have, but this? He sought to send us into the arms of the enemy. And thus, we are compelled by justice to send him from this world.

Id: [0x00057DF7]
I want answers. Why did Johnson try and buy my people's land? Why was Pitcairn targeting Adams and Hancock? What purpose would Washington's murder have served? Why does your order support the British?

Id: [0x00057E05]
Is she alright doctor?!

Id: [0x00057E06]
There he is! Looks to be in fine health as well. Has a good set of lungs on him. Now I don't mean to rush you, but we need to get both you and- does he have a name yet?

Id: [0x00057E07]
Hunter.

Id: [0x00057E08]
Lovely. We need to be getting Prudence and Hunter to a clean bed where they can recover in peace.

Id: [0x00057E2D]
Would you like some help hanging it?

Id: [0x00057E2F]
So now that you've been told, might I have a word? We have MUCH work to do!

Id: [0x00057E30]
Of course! What would you have me do?

Id: [0x00057E31]
Accompany me to the Inn, I have business there.

Id: [0x00057E33]
Norris is a stickler when it comes to tradition. Myriam knows not where her father is and they were hopeful that you might act his part at the ceremony.

Id: [0x00057E34]
I am not familiar with colonial wedding customs.

Id: [0x00057E35]
It means you will walk with her during the ceremony and give her to Norris as her father would.

Id: [0x00057E36]
I would be honored.

Id: [0x00057E37]
Wonderful. On to other business! Our weddings are complex beasts and require many hands working together to execute. We'll need Warren and Prudence to provide food, Ellen to make them appropriate clothes, Big Dave to smith wedding bands, me to conduct the service and Oliver and Corrine to host a banquet.

Id: [0x00057E3A]
We'll start here.

Id: [0x00057E3E]
Connor.

Id: [0x00057E3F]
Everything seems to be in order for the big day!

Id: [0x00057E40]
It is. Except I can't find Myriam.

Id: [0x00057E41]
I am certain she is making sure all is perfect. I will find her my friend.

Id: [0x00057E45]
Strange.

Id: [0x00057E47]
She fled? But why?

Id: [0x00057E4A]
[breathing]Why do you run?

Id: [0x00057E4B]
Leave me be! I'm no house wife!

Id: [0x00057E4C]
Nobody thinks you are one!

Id: [0x00057E4D]
That's what all this means!

Id: [0x00057E4E]
Norris wants only for you to be happy!

Id: [0x00057E51]
Myriam! Myriam! Norris means not to change you! He admires you for who you are! You need be nothing else! He has told me himself!

Id: [0x00057E72]
I trust the mounting evidence is proof enough, Connor.

Id: [0x00057E73]
I've never met the man.

Id: [0x00057E74]
May I ask why you seek him, Connor?

Id: [0x00057E8E]
Your aid is welcome and I am grateful.

Id: [0x00057E8F]
You did well tonight.

Id: [0x00057E90]
I said I'd buy you an ale when you first helped me. In place of drink I offer you my allegiance, for what it's worth.

Id: [0x00057EB4]
We need to keep those bastards at bay while the tea's being dumped. Let me help. I am yours to command.

Id: [0x00057EBE]
Tell me how she seemed to you.

Id: [0x00057EBF]
In great pain. She could not move herself.

Id: [0x00057EC0]
Was she pale? Was there blood?

Id: [0x00057EC1]
Not that I saw.

Id: [0x00057EC2]
Might be we have some time.

Id: [0x00057EC5]
My friend!

Id: [0x00057EC7]
Norris! What are you doing?!

Id: [0x00057EC8]
She said yes!!

Id: [0x00057EC9]
Myriam?!

Id: [0x00057ECA]
We are getting married!

Id: [0x00057ECC]
I told you not to touch him, Norris! [laughs]

Id: [0x00057ECD]
Is it true?

Id: [0x00057ECE]
Yes! [laughs]

Id: [0x00057ECF]
Ha ha!

Id: [0x00057F17]
Afternoon.

Id: [0x00057F18]
Deserter!

Id: [0x00057F33]
Why did you run?

Id: [0x00057F34]
Leave me be. I am no house wife.

Id: [0x00057F35]
Nobody thinks you are one.

Id: [0x00057F36]
That's what all this means.

Id: [0x00057F37]
Norris means not to change you. He admires you for who you are. You need be nothing else. He has told me himself.

Id: [0x00057F3D]
Excuse me, everyone. [the party quiets]Thank you I won't keep you long. I would like to present something to Connor and you all. I once said I'd find a way to show my gratitude for your courageous actions in my defense and this is what I give you today.

Id: [0x00057F3F]
This flag is a symbol of our strength and unity and I would hope you'd all be proud to fly it high above your homes and shops. I'll happily make one for each and every one of you if you so desire but this one is for you, Connor.

Id: [0x00057F41]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00057F43]
I'll have a flagpole put up as soon as possible.

Id: [0x00057F5E]
It is done.

Id: [0x00057F5F]
Johnson is dead?

Id: [0x00057F60]
No. He retreated when we destroyed the tea.

Id: [0x00057F61]
Only to hatch some new scheme, I'm sure... You should have killed him.

Id: [0x00057F65]
There was no need.

Id: [0x00057F67]
Time will tell if you speak the truth.

Id: [0x00057FC3]
Mason Weems?

Id: [0x00057FC4]
Could be.

Id: [0x00057FC5]
I need your help.

Id: [0x00057FC6]
Oh?

Id: [0x00057FC7]
They say you know a way out of here.

Id: [0x00057FC8]
THEY say a lot of things...

Id: [0x00057FC9]
I do not have time for games.

Id: [0x00057FCA]
A shame, as I was hoping you might play one with me.

Id: [0x00057FCC]
Fine.

Id: [0x00057FCD]
Are you familiar with the rules?

Id: [0x00057FD2]
Seeing as you already know mine - what's your name?

Id: [0x00057FD3]
Connor.

Id: [0x00057FD6]
Well played! [a beat]So, what brings you to Bridewell?

Id: [0x00057FD7]
Treachery. I have been falsely accused.

Id: [0x00057FD8]
Of course you have...

Id: [0x00057FDA]
You do not believe me.

Id: [0x00057FDB]
Why should I? You've the look of a brute.

Id: [0x00057FDC]
You misjudge. I am an honest man.

Id: [0x00057FDE]
And yet also a man imprisoned. [a pause]Tell me how you found yourself in this place.

Id: [0x00057FDF]
It is a private matter.

Id: [0x00057FE0]
As is what you ask of me...

Id: [0x00057FE2]
I was trying to prevent a murder.

Id: [0x00057FE3]
Oh? Anyone I know?

Id: [0x00057FE5]
George Washington.

Id: [0x00057FE8]
The others put you up to this, didn't they? Thought it might be fun to have another laugh at Mason's expense? Fools, the lot of them, to make light of something like this.

Id: [0x00057FEA]
Then you understand why I need to get out of here. If I don't help him, he is going to die.

Id: [0x00057FEC]
You're serious, aren't you?

Id: [0x00057FEE]
Very well. But it's going to take some doing. See - everything hinges on the key I forged. But that lout Finch stole it! Took me three months to make the thing, too. You need to get it back or we're not going anywhere.

Id: [0x00057FF2]
Consider it done.

Id: [0x00057FF3]
My enemy is tenacious. When money failed them, they took to force. But I have slain Johnson and Pitcairn both, ending their plots. George Washington now rallies the colonists and their march towards freedom begins in earnest. Little wonder, then, that The Templars now want him dead. They seek to reshape this land into something cold and ordered. Something soulless. And he is an obstacle. I must save him, that his cause can flourish and my people remain safe. But the more I prod, the greater the chance I am discovered. The Templars believe their men lost to the revolution. In their eyes, the Assassins are gone and scattered - no longer a threat. But I fear they will soon discover the truth, and me along with it. I must tread carefully...

Id: [0x0005801A]
Yes. That we might unmask the great betrayer.

Id: [0x00058048]
So what is your stake in all this?

Id: [0x00058049]
Same as yours. Peace. Stability. A land in which all might live side by side - free and equal.

Id: [0x0005804A]
Why not join the brotherhood, then?

Id: [0x0005804B]
My father was an Assassin. Quite good at his job, too, as I understand it. But... [a pause]I hope to have children some day. It's hard to live in two worlds at the same time. So I chose to live in one.

Id: [0x0005804C]
I understand.

Id: [0x0005804E]
What can you tell me of Thomas Hickey?

Id: [0x0005804F]
He has been running a counterfeiting ring in the city. Locate the source of his operation, and we can have him arrested. He cannot harm the Commander if he is in prison.

Id: [0x00058050]
Be still. You will do no more harm.

Id: [0x00058052]
How's Bridewell treatin' ya, lad? Not too rough, I hope.

Id: [0x00058054]
I asked a few friends to pay you a visit. They been by yet? Thought you might like the company...

Id: [0x00058056]
[laugh]Wait til you see what we have planned for you...

Id: [0x00058058]
Your sweetheart Tallmadge is tryin' to get you out. He ain't have much luck, I'm afraid. Master Lee made sure of that.

Id: [0x0005805A]
Just a few more days and this'll all be over - fer you 'n Georgie bof.

Id: [0x0005805C]
It's a nice pair of blades you got. Think I'll take 'em for myself when I get out.

Id: [0x0005805E]
I might not be able to leave here, but don't mean I can't find ways to trouble you... Remember that.

Id: [0x00058065]
Connor. Come with me downstairs.

Id: [0x00058093]
Hey! Redcoats! Your King is a pig!

Id: [0x00058096]
Stephane. Please. Stop and listen to me.

Id: [0x00058097]
I've listened for long enough! They come into MY home and take MY things? I will get my revenge. The man responsible for this will pay. His friends will pay!

Id: [0x00058099]
Ces coquins me prennent mon p√®re au Canada et voil√† qu'ils me ravissent ma propri√©t√© ici. Il suffit! (The dirty bastards take my father from me in Canada and now they take my property in Boston. I've had enough!)

Id: [0x0005809B]
O√π que j'aille, l'Anglois croise mon chemin. Ils me volent ma maison, ils m'obligent √† fuir mon pays. Et les voici qui veulent s'approprier ma NOUVELLE demeure! (I cannot escape the English, no matter where I go. They kick me out of my home, I come here. Now they want to take my NEW home!)

Id: [0x0005809D]
Voil√† trop longtemps que je subis ces affronts! Ils vont go√ªter de mon courroux! (I've been a nice man for too long! They will know my fury!)

Id: [0x0005809F]
That IS a lot.

Id: [0x000580A4]
These are troubled times. The already uneasy alliance between the Crown and its subjects frays. And behind them both, the Templars plot, pulling strings and moving pieces. History dictates they seek order through control. But how will they affect it here? Who supports them? And what conspiracies have they already spun? All these things I must determine. For only by knowing my enemy can I hope to stop them.

Id: [0x000580A6]
Will you be able to make it to the house?

Id: [0x000580A7]
Yes. I think the ball took only flesh.

Id: [0x000580A8]
And what is your name?

Id: [0x000580A9]
Myriam.

Id: [0x000580AA]
Do you live nearby?

Id: [0x000580AB]
Ah. I don't have a home, per se. I took to the frontier when I was a young girl, I made my life out here ever since- living where the land makes it easiest.

Id: [0x000580AC]
Not a common choice for a woman of the Colonies.

Id: [0x000580AD]
No it's not. But truth be told, it was this, the convent or the brothels. I prefer the open air.

Id: [0x000581A7]
Parker seems to believe you're not completely useless. So I suppose there's a thing or two you might be able to help with...

Id: [0x000581A9]
I can vouch for him.

Id: [0x000581AA]
John Parker as well.

Id: [0x000581AB]
Where's Revere?

Id: [0x000581AC]
Captured.

Id: [0x000581AD]
What?

Id: [0x000581AE]
Fear not. That man's no stranger to sticky situations. He'll be fine, I'm sure of it.

Id: [0x000581B0]
Ahem!

Id: [0x000581B1]
You ladies finished gossiping?

Id: [0x000581B3]
You have my word.

Id: [0x000581B6]
I should have struck when I had the chance... Do you know where Pitcairn could've gone?

Id: [0x000581B8]
Takes a true monster to do something like this... At least they're gone.

Id: [0x000581BB]
Back into the withered bosom of the British no doubt - so that he might regroup and plan his next atrocity.

Id: [0x000581BC]
I need to find him. Every day I wait, more will suffer...

Id: [0x000581BE]
Chin up, friend. Many who should've died today now live because of you.

Id: [0x000581C3]
Hm.. It never is...

Id: [0x000581C7]
It is not enough.

Id: [0x000581C8]
And what of them?

Id: [0x000581C9]
We do the best we can with what we've got.

Id: [0x000581CC]
Where'd those scoundrels get off to?

Id: [0x000581CE]
Can't have counterfeiters running loose in the city...

Id: [0x000581D0]
Where'd ya go, ya cheats?

Id: [0x000581D2]
Come on! They can't be far from here...

Id: [0x000581FA]
Pardon me.

Id: [0x000581FB]
Aw, come on, mate.

Id: [0x00058204]
Leave me be!

Id: [0x00058206]
Ahhh!

Id: [0x00058208]
Don't hurt me!

Id: [0x0005820C]
On who's orders?

Id: [0x0005820D]
Samuel Adams.

Id: [0x0005820F]
This location is exposed. We'll be defeated if we remain.

Id: [0x00058234]
Is that so, old man? Or perhaps we should step outside? I will gladly demonstrate how easily I could trounce y-

Id: [0x00058239]
Destroyed!? You stupid mongrel. And I suppose you want me to tell Johnson his tea just spontaneously combusted! Nonsense! Someone's responsible for this and you will find out who. And if you can't, I'll gut you and find a smarter mongrel who can.

Id: [0x0005823B]
Who the bloody hell are you?!

Id: [0x0005823E]
W-why?

Id: [0x0005823F]
You have no right to rob people blind. By decree of British Parliament or not.

Id: [0x00058240]
British Parliament? I work for William Johnson.

Id: [0x00058244]
Johnson?

Id: [0x00058246]
Please...

Id: [0x00058247]
End his suffering cleanly.

Id: [0x00058249]
Quiet!

Id: [0x0005824E]
'Course not.

Id: [0x0005824F]
Listen - there are more important things at stake here. This man is planning to-

Id: [0x00058252]
[ahem]George Washington is brave beyond measure, loyal like a brother, peerless in character, and unshakeable in his convictions! That man is our Jupiter Conservator, destined to lead us not just to freedom, but greatness. Anyone who says otherwise is either a simpleton or a traitor.

Id: [0x0005825E]
Not worth meeting the Reaper over this.

Id: [0x00058260]
AHHH!

Id: [0x00058262]
Time to leave.

Id: [0x00058268]
Your meddling in the revolution has caused us no small measure of grief. It cannot continue. Our work is too important. But what would you know, beyond all the lies Achilles feeds you and the tales you tell yourself.

Id: [0x00058269]
Is that... a compliment?

Id: [0x0005826A]
Now don't misconstrue. I'm sure the whole endeavor will end tragically. But to have come this far... Well, it's more than I ever expected.

Id: [0x0005826E]
I still contribute as I can. It's why we're here now.

Id: [0x00058273]
Pleased to met you, Connor.

Id: [0x00058278]
What's the matter?

Id: [0x00058279]
I have spent today drawn from one bit of madness to another with nothing to show for it. Before I go any further, I would like to know exactly what it is you intend.

Id: [0x0005827A]
Simple seems a bit charitable.

Id: [0x0005827B]
Cheer up, Connor - for tonight we are all victors! The Sons of Liberty get to send a message to England and you rob William Johnson of his financing. Your village will be saved.

Id: [0x00058282]
This is a mistake! We should sign.

Id: [0x0005829D]
I have your plans. What are they for?

Id: [0x0005829E]
You got them!? This, Connor, is the design for a chair that FOLDS. Genius. You won't regret this!

Id: [0x0005829F]
Connor! Might I have a word?

Id: [0x000582A1]
Before you found me the British had demanded I not treat Patriots nor their supporters. I refused so they set about destroying my business. This tells me their smear campaign is still very much in effect. If things don't change, I may be forced to leave.

Id: [0x000582A2]
You might start by finding the courier who brought this to me. He works out of Boston.

Id: [0x000582A3]
I am here on behalf of Doctor White. It is time the campaign against him came to an end. Who is selling the papers that slander him?

Id: [0x000582A4]
You won't find argument from me- Doc Lyle healed my leg, good as new. The pamphlets are being distributed by a few paper boys around Boston.

Id: [0x000582A7]
I think he's overseeing to the North now.

Id: [0x000582A9]
I believe he's working the south of the city at present.

Id: [0x000582AB]
[grunt]He is just doing a job. I must not harm him.

Id: [0x000582CA]
Invitation, please.

Id: [0x000582CC]
Shall I take your coat, sir?

Id: [0x000582D2]
Ladies and gentlemen, you are requested to kindly find your seats.

Id: [0x00058329]
A lawyer is an honest employment, so is mine.  Like me too he acts in a double capacity, both against rogues and for ‚Äòem; for ‚Äòtis but fitting that we should protect and encourage cheats, since we live by them.

Id: [0x00058330]
I can't tell you how happy I was to hear they'd mounted this revival. Gay's best work by far. Have you seen it before?

Id: [0x00058331]
Once. My father brought me here as a child, though I remember little of it. And I don‚Äôt suppose tonight will afford me the luxury of a proper viewing either.

Id: [0x00058332]
No, I' afraid it won‚Äôt.

Id: [0x00058334]
On to business then. [a beat]Do you see him?

Id: [0x00058336]
He‚Äôs seated in one of the boxes above.

Id: [0x00058338]
The stairs are watched. You‚Äôll need to find another way up.

Id: [0x0005833A]
I already have.

Id: [0x00058348]
Sir, black Moll hath sent word her trial comes on in the Afternoon, and she hopes you will order matters so as to bring her off.

Id: [0x00058349]
Why, she may plead her belly at worst; to my knowledge she hath taken care of that security.  But as the wench is very active and industrious, you may satisfy her that I‚Äôll soften the evidence.

Id: [0x0005834A]
Tom Gagg, Sir, is found guilty.

Id: [0x0005834B]
A lazy Dog! When I took him the time before, I told him what he would come to if he did not mend his hand.  This is death without reprieve.  I may venture to Book him. [writes]For Tom Gagg, forty pounds.  Let Betty Sly know that I‚Äôll save her from transportation, for I can get more by her staying in England.

Id: [0x0005834C]
Betty hath brought more goods into our lock to-year than any five of the gang; and in truth, ‚Äòtis a pity to lose so good a customer.

Id: [0x0005834D]
If none of the gang take her off, she may, in the common course of business, live a twelve-month longer.  I love to let Women ‚Äòscape.  A good sportsman always lets the hen partridges fly, because the breed of the game depends upon them.  Besides, here the law allows us no reward; there is nothing to be got by the death of women ‚Äì except our wives.

Id: [0x0005834E]
Without dispute, she is a fine woman!  ‚ÄòTwas to her I was oblig‚Äôd for my education, and (to say a bold word) she hath train‚Äôd up more young Fellows to the business than the gaming-table.

Id: [0x0005834F]
Truly, Filch, thy Observation is right.  We and the surgeons are more beholden to women than all the Professions besides.

Id: [0x00058352]
A thousand pardons...

Id: [0x00058354]
My apologies...

Id: [0x00058356]
So sorry...

Id: [0x0005838D]
Herod all handsaws! Hell has manifest upon the sea. How many do you reckon?

Id: [0x0005838E]
Too many.

Id: [0x00058391]
If anyone can hold the line, 'tis us. I only hope the Admiral's quick to return.

Id: [0x00058393]
Alright, boys - make ready for war!

Id: [0x000583A8]
More on the way!

Id: [0x000583C3]
Man the lines!

Id: [0x000583C4]
Stand-by!

Id: [0x000583C6]
Flying in!

Id: [0x000583C7]
Flying out!

Id: [0x000583C8]
Heads!

Id: [0x000583CD]
But make haste to Newgate, boy and let my friends know what I intend; for I love to make them easy one way or other.

Id: [0x000583CE]
With a Gentleman is long kept in suspence, Penitence may break his spirit ever after.  Besides, certainty gives a man a good air upon his trial, and makes him risque another without fear or scruple.  But I‚Äôll away, for ‚Äòtis a pleasure to be the messenger of comfort to friends in affliction.

Id: [0x000583CF]
But ‚Äòtis now high time to look about me for a decent Execution against next sessions.  I hate a lazy rogue, by whom one can get nothing ‚Äôtill he is hang‚Äôd.  A register of the gang [reading]Crook-finger‚Äôd Jack.  A year and a half in the service; Let me see how much the Stock owes to his industry; one, two, three, four, five gold watches, and seven silver ones.  A mighty clean-handed fellow!  Sixteen snuff-boxes, five of them of true gold...

Id: [0x00058419]
Man-of-war approaching!

Id: [0x00058445]
Flats in place!

Id: [0x0005844D]
Move! Move!

Id: [0x0005844F]
Get out of my way!

Id: [0x00058451]
Over there! That's the one did the murder!

Id: [0x00058456]
No no no no, not the left foot! Never the left foot. Horrible luck. Step with your right foot first.

Id: [0x00058483]
Hold a moment. I need to fetch a few things before we get to work.

Id: [0x0005848E]
Do you like it here, Charles?

Id: [0x0005848F]
There's a certain charm to Boston, I suppose. To all of the colonies, really. Granted, their cities have none of London's sophistication or splendor, but the people are earnest and hard-working. They've a pioneer spirit I find compelling.

Id: [0x00058490]
It's quite something really - watching a place that's finally found its feet.

Id: [0x00058491]
Has it though? The French still wage war from up North. And I fear the Spanish have designs upon this place as well... Is this a new world? Or just another battlefield?

Id: [0x00058492]
Ah, that's a story old as time itself, and one that's not like to change. We're cruel and desperate creatures, set in our conquering ways. The Saxons and the Franks. The Ottomans and Safavids. I could go on for hours. The whole of human history is but a series of conflicts and subjugations. A desire for more, and more, and more.

Id: [0x00058493]
I pray one day we rise above it.

Id: [0x00058494]
Whilst you pray, I'll act. We'll see who finds success first, hmm?

Id: [0x00058495]
It was an expression.

Id: [0x00058496]
Aye. And a dangerous one. Words have power. Wield them wisely.

Id: [0x000584B5]
We can blow the door with those. Go on. Shoot 'em.

Id: [0x000584BE]
[laugh]On wit the show, then.

Id: [0x000584C2]
Dammit! Out of bullets...

Id: [0x000584C7]
Oi! 'Aytham! This one's got some shot on 'im. Ya might want to be grabbin' it on account of your pistol being parched.

Id: [0x000584CA]
Back to the Green Dragon, then. I need a drink.

Id: [0x00058756]
NEWS-AN-UPDATES-ON-BOS'ON heerreeee!

Id: [0x00058757]
Tragedy at Fort Necessity! French forces declare victory following Washington's retreat!

Id: [0x00058758]
In response, the Duke of Newcastle pledges more troops to counter the foreign menace!

Id: [0x0005875A]
You sir! Buy a broadsheet an learn the news! 6 pence!

Id: [0x0005875C]
Bloody foreigners got long pockets an short arms. [spits]

Id: [0x0005875F]
Bloody hell.

Id: [0x00058763]
Thief! Someone stop him!

Id: [0x0005876C]
[giggles]Hullo sir.

Id: [0x0005881D]
Time to take a listen... With luck, one of those people knows what became of Benjamin...

Id: [0x0005881F]
But if you could have seen it! They were surely drunk, carrying on like that. And during the day, no less!

Id: [0x00058820]
Such scandalous behavior from one who aims to be a surgeon? Not likely if he keeps up such carousing...

Id: [0x00058823]
A truly a shameful display. Benjamin's parents would be mortified.

Id: [0x00058825]
...I asked if I could help and they waved me away. Insisted it was all under control.

Id: [0x00058826]
How odd. Did they say what had happened?

Id: [0x00058827]
No. Only that it was a trifling matter and  he'd be returned home soon. There was some blood, though... So I wonder if it wasn't more serious than they let on.

Id: [0x0005882B]
Probably looking for a nice quiet place to do the deed. From what I hear tell, his work usually involves quite a bit of screamin'.

Id: [0x0005884E]
Careful. The place is well guarded. We need to slip past them...

Id: [0x00058852]
Locked! Hmmm. I'll have to find the key. Wait here.

Id: [0x00058854]
(Scream)

Id: [0x00058856]
(Sounds of a struggle)

Id: [0x00058857]
Here we are, then.

Id: [0x0005885A]
Oi! Over here ya bastards!

Id: [0x0005885C]
Come on! Have at me!

Id: [0x000588D1]
What are you planning?

Id: [0x000588D2]
To steal Master Pitcairn.

Id: [0x000588D3]
What?

Id: [0x000588D4]
You'll see. [a beat]Now, when I give the signal, you're to distract Braddock's patrol and lure them into a dead end.

Id: [0x000588E7]
Hear me out good people of Boston! The King's army has need of strong and loyal men. Dark forces gather to the North, desirous of our land and its great bounty! I come before you today with a request. If you value your possessions, your families, your very lives - then join us! Take up arms in service to God and country both, that we might defend all we have created here!

Id: [0x000588E9]
Hmmm. Where shall we head next?

Id: [0x000588EA]
Perhaps down Marlbrough?

Id: [0x000588EB]
No... its residents are too content. Their homes are nice - their days untroubled.

Id: [0x000588EC]
What of Lyn or Ship Street?

Id: [0x000588ED]
Yes. Those fresh arrived are often soon in dire straits. They're more likely to seize upon an opportunity to fatten their purses and feed their young.

Id: [0x00058911]
Oi!

Id: [0x00058913]
Fie on you and your false war!

Id: [0x00058914]
After him!

Id: [0x0005891D]
Unhand him, Edward!

Id: [0x00058925]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0005892D]
I made a promise to you, Silas - one I intend to keep.

Id: [0x0005894E]
Keep them away from us, Church.

Id: [0x0005894F]
Of course.

Id: [0x00058951]
God damned dogs...

Id: [0x00058952]
I've never been fond of them either. Lee - on the other hand... Loves the monsters.

Id: [0x00058958]
Have you found her?

Id: [0x00058959]
She's made camp not too far from here.

Id: [0x0005895D]
We're too late...

Id: [0x0005895F]
The fire's only just been snuffed. The snow recently disturbed. She's close.

Id: [0x00058966]
These tracks are fresh, they must be hers.

Id: [0x0005896B]
Hmmm. Seems she took to higher ground. Out of the snow and into the trees.

Id: [0x0005896F]
If I might ask, sir, where did you learn to do all this?

Id: [0x00058970]
It is a requirement when you are raised in the manner that I was...

Id: [0x00058972]
Perception is fundamental to the Order. It guides the feet when running and climbing. Informs the hands when striking and fighting. But most important, it transforms the senses. And we begin to know the world in a different way.

Id: [0x000591F3]
Won't get very far beached on a shoal!

Id: [0x000591F5]
Stay off the shoals Connor!

Id: [0x000591F7]
That'll slow us down. Beware the sand bars!

Id: [0x000593C0]
I told you I didn't need your help! If you'd listened, none of this would've happened!

Id: [0x000593C1]
Quit puttin' this on me! I told YOU we didn't need to be cuttin' that day! So shut your mouth!

Id: [0x000593C2]
You bloody nitwit!

Id: [0x000593C3]
You want a piece, big man?

Id: [0x000593C4]
That does it.

Id: [0x000593CB]
I think it best he plays me.

Id: [0x000593CC]
I see you are getting along again.

Id: [0x000593CD]
Oh yeah. We're always at each other for one thing or another but more oft than not we work it out in the end. Was just the thought of my family threatened got me hot under the collar.

Id: [0x000593CE]
And Terry knows he couldn't beat me in a fight.

Id: [0x000593CF]
You rat!

Id: [0x000593D0]
...That's why he built this bowls pitch- so he could beat me at something. Still can't though, can ya Terry?

Id: [0x000593D1]
I was winning 'til Connor came along!

Id: [0x000593D2]
Suuure you were.

Id: [0x000593D3]
I might try.

Id: [0x000593E7]
Ahoy, Bobby!

Id: [0x000593EB]
Hullo. Name's Amanda. You must be the captain.

Id: [0x000593ED]
You stride into my bar off the piss and looking for officers. Days later I start hearing whispers the Ghost of the North Seas stalks the Atlantic again.

Id: [0x00059413]
Even a pretty sunrise is a bad omen to you, Mister Faulkner. Where are these raiders?

Id: [0x00059414]
By guess and by God an Easterly course - t'wards the coast. Miss Mandy reports of some British boats gathering somewhere in these rocks, threatenin' the Vineyard.

Id: [0x0005941E]
Mortars!

Id: [0x0005944C]
Our charge, captain. The Belladonna under Roderigue Hortalez and Company. She appears Spanish for intents and purposes, but rest assured she's a French vessel.

Id: [0x00059450]
We'll go when we're good and bloody ready.

Id: [0x00059451]
Keep a sharp eye, Mister Faulkner. Anybody searching for the Belladonna could be upon us in an instant with this fog.

Id: [0x00059453]
English frigates!

Id: [0x00059454]
English are on us, cap'n!

Id: [0x00059457]
La Belladonna is taking fire!

Id: [0x00059459]
We must protect her!

Id: [0x0005945B]
Do your job, capitaine! (captain!) Defend la Belladonna!

Id: [0x0005945D]
They picked the wrong ship to pirate.

Id: [0x0005945F]
Another wreck for the deep.

Id: [0x00059461]
Bon! (Good!)

Id: [0x0005954B]
Anything, captain?

Id: [0x0005954C]
Due North of here.

Id: [0x00059558]
The Randolph!

Id: [0x00059559]
What's that weasel up to? Sheet anchor to windward, captain. You can be sure he's got something up his sleeve.

Id: [0x00059564]
Bring down her mainmast!

Id: [0x00059574]
Her mainmast is down! We have that fartleberry over a barrel!

Id: [0x0005958F]
She's ours men! Prepare to board! Biddle is mine!

Id: [0x0005959D]
I can't believe you mean to leave the Randolph! She's a mighty vessel captain- and what of Biddle?! You show him mercy in the face of--

Id: [0x000595A3]
Victory for the Aquila! For her glory! Hip hip!

Id: [0x000595A4]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595A5]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595A6]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595A7]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595A8]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595A9]
Hip hip!

Id: [0x000595AA]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595AB]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595AC]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595AD]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595AE]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595AF]
Hip hip!

Id: [0x000595B0]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595B1]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595B2]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595B3]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000595B4]
Hurrah!

Id: [0x000596D6]
Ah, it's good to be at sea again! [noticing some menacing clouds]But I don't much like that sky.

Id: [0x000596D9]
Sails ahoy!

Id: [0x000596E3]
We need to keep the gunboats off 'er 'til she reaches the Vineyard pier!

Id: [0x000596E7]
MINES CAPTAIN!

Id: [0x000596E9]
They've veered north. Naught there but an abandoned fort.

Id: [0x000596F0]
FORT! FORT!

Id: [0x000596F1]
And it's too close to the Vineyard! Time and tide waits for no man! Take out her towers!

Id: [0x000596F5]
That is the problem. What reason would the English have to threaten Martha's Vineyard? It has no strategic value and its people remain peaceful. I fear an influence of a different kind saw to this.

Id: [0x000596FC]
The Aquila has returned and I need her help. Nicholas Biddle now sails for the Patriots, captaining the Randolph. But the man is raiding up and down the coast 'round Nantucket claiming it's a Loyalist post.

Id: [0x000596FD]
Where is he now?

Id: [0x00059700]
Speak of the Devil.

Id: [0x00059705]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x00059706]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x00059707]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x00059708]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x00059709]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x0005970A]
Huzzah!

Id: [0x0005970C]
Wait here.

Id: [0x0005971B]
Ah, dammit!

Id: [0x0005971D]
Wait! Come back!

Id: [0x00059721]
Stop running! I only wish to talk!

Id: [0x00059723]
I am not your enemy!

Id: [0x00059725]
Please, just hear me out!

Id: [0x0005972F]
Gods, woman! Only let me speak!

Id: [0x00059743]
Enough with these games!

Id: [0x00059745]
You try my patience, woman!

Id: [0x00059747]
It is imperative that we speak! A moment of your time is all I ask!

Id: [0x00059749]
Stop running! I will not ask again!

Id: [0x00059777]
I hope so...

Id: [0x0005977B]
I hear tell the French are readying to move on our positions. Wonder what Braddock intends to do about it.

Id: [0x0005977D]
...can't stand being quartered there. The endless crashing of the waves. The sting of the salt in my eyes. And the goddammed gulls shrieking and shitting everywhere.

Id: [0x0005977E]
You're sure that's where we're goin'?

Id: [0x00059780]
Aye. The Bulldog's putting together another "expedition".

Id: [0x00059781]
That what they're callin' 'em now? Expeditions?

Id: [0x00059782]
Aye. Smart too. Slap a fancy name on something and all evil is excused.

Id: [0x00059784]
We gotta find a way to pry them Indians from the Frogs. With them on our side, we're sure to win.

Id: [0x00059788]
Good luck with that. Past year's been nothing but one defeat after another. Why would they throw in with us?

Id: [0x00059789]
Braddock's got more'n two thousand men and ten cannons to boot. They'll win us what words won't.

Id: [0x00059791]
British gunboats after one of the Vineyard's ships captain! We must protect her!

Id: [0x00059792]
Templars.

Id: [0x000597A0]
Why is Biddle doing this? Nantucket is for the Patriots!

Id: [0x000597A2]
The company he keeps tells me his true allegiance lies elsewhere.

Id: [0x000597A6]
The Randolph has turned sail. Do we chase him?

Id: [0x000597A7]
We cannot leave this merchant vessel to the mercy of the English.

Id: [0x000597BC]
More English by the cut of their jibs.

Id: [0x000597C3]
It's rare, but it happens. You did well. What's bothering me is Biddle's a Patriot now. Why's he helping the British Navy like that? Old friends maybe?

Id: [0x000597C4]
How would you convince the Continental Congress that the Navy needs more ships?

Id: [0x000597CC]
French are bringin' in a boatload of powder and guns for Old Georgie and his Patriots. Some Colonial boats were s‚Äôposed to escort her up the coast but they left her behind. She been waitin' ever since.

Id: [0x000597CD]
We will make sure Washington gets what he is expecting.

Id: [0x000597D6]
Hardly. But I'll have to approach this carefully.

Id: [0x000597D7]
Use the snowstorm to mask your approach.

Id: [0x000597DA]
Go on, then. I'll keep watch from here.

Id: [0x000597E1]
mmm... I can hide in that cart...

Id: [0x000597E3]
What's in the wagon? I need a full inventory.

Id: [0x000597E5]
As you wish. Let's see... 2 barrels of salt. 12 pounds pork. 10 pounds beef. 7 dozen eggs. 16 wheels of cheese - none of it French, don't worry. 5 bottles of whiskey. Couple dozen new uniforms, boots, and leather for patching. Blankets. A cart of feed for the horses. Wot else... Wot else...

Id: [0x000597E7]
That's it. That's all there is.

Id: [0x000597E9]
At least this will be ended soon...

Id: [0x000597EA]
That map will surely be of use. I need to find it.

Id: [0x000597EC]
Where is the General now?

Id: [0x000597ED]
Rallying the troops.

Id: [0x000597F0]
Those cannons are like to cause trouble. Perhaps I could sabotage them...

Id: [0x00059824]
I want to see this myself.

Id: [0x00059829]
Pursue the Randolph.

Id: [0x0005982C]
Who are they?

Id: [0x0005982E]
Hm.. Biddle aims to be the first Admiral of the Colonial Navy and is making a case for the need.

Id: [0x00059834]
Where is le Capitaine? (the captain?)

Id: [0x00059835]
I am the captain.

Id: [0x00059837]
You are late.

Id: [0x00059838]
We came as quickly as the wind allowed.

Id: [0x00059839]
Too slow.

Id: [0x0005983E]
Partons. (Let's go.)

Id: [0x0005983F]
Quoi? (What?)

Id: [0x00059840]
The Atlantic is a dangerous place for a lone ship, especially one laden with such desirable stock. You must be glad to see us.

Id: [0x00059841]
Bof. It is hot here. My Lieutenant is not excited for the cold of the North.

Id: [0x00059842]
Is this man being serious?

Id: [0x00059843]
And what happened to your escort?

Id: [0x00059844]
Le Randolph started with us then departed without warning. Typique. (Typical.) This is why le Lieutenant insisted I come aboard.

Id: [0x00059858]
Why in God's name are the English here in such force?

Id: [0x00059859]
I do not know but we must get the Belladonna out of this fog.

Id: [0x0005985B]
MAN-O-WAR!

Id: [0x0005985C]
Bloody hell! Pummel that leviathan!

Id: [0x0005985D]
No! We board her. I must know how the English knew about the Belladonna. [projected]We take her a prize, men!

Id: [0x0005985F]
ARG!

Id: [0x00059860]
ARG!

Id: [0x00059861]
ARG!

Id: [0x00059862]
ARG!

Id: [0x00059865]
Grand Dieu! (Good God!) La Belladonna's mainmast is down, capitaine! (captain) We must stay close to her!

Id: [0x00059870]
How does the British Command know about the Belladonna?

Id: [0x00059871]
British Command knows nothing of this.

Id: [0x00059872]
Then how are you here?

Id: [0x00059873]
We were lead here by a Patriot. Nicholas Biddle.

Id: [0x00059874]
Who does Biddle work for?

Id: [0x00059879]
I think you know, Assassin.

Id: [0x0005987D]
What did the captain tell you?

Id: [0x0005987E]
Nicholas Biddle led them here. He set --

Id: [0x00059880]
The Randolph.

Id: [0x00059881]
The Randolph?! [projected]Beat to quarters!!

Id: [0x00059882]
Belay that order! [to Faulkner]He is putting us to his rudder. We cannot leave the Belladonna undefended.

Id: [0x00059883]
But sir!

Id: [0x000599D3]
And how was the opera?

Id: [0x00059D3A]
Of course.

Id: [0x00059D40]
That seems to be the last of them.

Id: [0x00059D59]
The Randolph is attacking a merchant vessel not far from here.

Id: [0x00059D5A]
All of the sudden Congress has a brand new ship for him to captain. From British coxswain to captain of a Colonial Flagship. Something doesn't add up.

Id: [0x00059D70]
Is that why you hunted me? Because you thought me an enemy to the cause? You're every bit the fool I was told.

Id: [0x00059D71]
You brought pain and suffering upon innocent people for nothing but personal gain.

Id: [0x00059D72]
Pain. Suffering. I set them free. Weeded out the dissenters and empowered the Patriots. So what if I was named Admiral. The Revolution needs one and I was the best man for the job. The only man. If not for me, the Continental Navy would remain but a handful of rafts. For all your vision, you Assassins are blind to the truth.

Id: [0x00059D74]
Enough.

Id: [0x00059D75]
Wait. Let the Randolph die with me. Don't take her as a prize. Please. Please. I want no quarter, just to sink with my ship.

Id: [0x00059D7A]
Jeeeesus!

Id: [0x00059D7B]
I guess that's that then. A tad over-dramatic, if you ask me. Still, a waste of a formidable ship. [beat]How's about a cheer for the boys then, eh?

Id: [0x00059D7E]
Your reign over the Colonial coast has come to an end.

Id: [0x00059D80]
But what they intend, I do not know.

Id: [0x00059D81]
That fort won't be troubling anybody no-more. Bloody English have gone too far this time.

Id: [0x00059D82]
Frigates!

Id: [0x00059D83]
The rash of British raiding along the coast is reason enough to address the gripe. Gunboats at the Vineyard, now this...

Id: [0x00059D9F]
Don't forget your invitation. Master Birch will be meeting you inside.

Id: [0x00059DA1]
Thank you.

Id: [0x00059DA2]
Where shall I retrieve you once you're done?

Id: [0x00059DA6]
Evening Haytham.

Id: [0x00059DA7]
Reginald.

Id: [0x00059DAB]
A little help, please!

Id: [0x00059DAC]
Quit yer cryin', I'm comin'!

Id: [0x00059DAE]
Thomas!

Id: [0x00059DAF]
Wot?

Id: [0x00059DB0]
Over there, that's what! Deal with them!

Id: [0x00059DB2]
Wait! Them bodies is sure to have loot on 'em. Would be a shame to let it all go to waste.

Id: [0x00059DB3]
Are you mad?! In case you'd forgotten, we're in the midst of something.

Id: [0x00059DB4]
Aww. Why you always got ta go an spoil the sport?

Id: [0x00059DB6]
Look at those badgers! Runnin' around all hubble de shuff.

Id: [0x00059DB8]
Stop them Thomas!

Id: [0x00059DB9]
In a jeffy, boss!

Id: [0x00059DBC]
Oi! Mister Johnson's gonna need ta double my pay after all dis if he expects me to keep at 'is side.

Id: [0x00059DBE]
I hope whatever's in this chest is worth it...

Id: [0x00059DC0]
Come on, now. It's just a few fools with knives... they ain't so tough.

Id: [0x00059DC1]
It's not the scoundrels I'm concerned with...

Id: [0x00059DC8]
I stay my hand today because you were once my brother - and a better man than this. But should our paths ever cross again, all debts will be forgotten.

Id: [0x00059DCA]
You're free now, John.

Id: [0x00059DCC]
Traitor! Go on then! Join them on their fool's errand! And when you find yourself lying broken and dying at the bottom of some dark pit - I pray my words today are the last that you remember.

Id: [0x00059DCF]
I'll explain everything on the way...

Id: [0x00059DD0]
Allow me to explain: We enter Silas' fort under the pretense of kinship. Once inside we spring our trap, free the captives, and kill the slaver.

Id: [0x00059F26]
I see you've been busy.

Id: [0x00059F28]
All these men are from many different tribes - united in their desire to see Braddock sent away.

Id: [0x00059F2C]
And you? Who do you stand for?

Id: [0x00059F2D]
Myself.

Id: [0x00059F33]
What would you have me do?

Id: [0x00059F34]
We will help the others to prepare.

Id: [0x00059F94]
She should be safe now but it's a hot chase. Get after them and end the threat on the Vineyard.

Id: [0x00059F98]
Do you trust her?

Id: [0x00059F99]
With my life, captain.

Id: [0x00059F9A]
Now- what's all this about then?

Id: [0x00059F9C]
Your orders?

Id: [0x00059F9D]
We need to find out what Biddle intends but we must hurry.

Id: [0x00059F9F]
What else do you know of Biddle?

Id: [0x00059FA8]
Board her? Es-tu fou? (Are you crazy?)

Id: [0x00059FB3]
No doubt many wonder why it is we've pushed so far west. These are wild lands, as yet untamed and unsettled. But it shall not always be so.

Id: [0x00059FB5]
In time our holdings will no longer suffice.  And that day is closer than you think. We must ensure our people have ample room to grow and further prosper. Which means we need more land.

Id: [0x00059FB7]
The French understand this - and endeavor to prevent such growth. They skirt around our territory - erecting forts and forging alliances - awaiting the day they might strangle us with the noose they've built.

Id: [0x00059FB9]
Wait. To scatter the expedition is not enough. We must ensure that Braddock falls. Else he's sure to try again.

Id: [0x00059FC7]
The wood's too thick. At this rate it'll be days before we reach Duquesne. We should follow the river instead.

Id: [0x00059FC8]
The troop would be exposed there. We must maintain the element of surprise.

Id: [0x00059FC9]
We're near 2000 men. One scout is all they need to know of us... And then what? Swiftness would serve us better.

Id: [0x00059FCC]
I'm telling you, we've packed the cart too high! The ground is uneven - its dangers hidden. One false move and the whole thing is sure to fall over...

Id: [0x00059FCF]
How is it I always draw the short straw? It's a conspiracy, I tell you... The others have it out for me.

Id: [0x00059FD3]
With me, men. Braddock wants us posted in the woods - to watch for signs of trouble.

Id: [0x00059FD4]
What are our orders?

Id: [0x00059FD5]
Fire first. Question later.

Id: [0x00059FD8]
How could anyone call this forest home? It's all mud and bugs and monstrous things...

Id: [0x00059FD9]
Aye. Better we cut it all down. Clear a space for civilization - and not this wild dark.

Id: [0x00059FDA]
No wonder the savages are so filled with fury. I'd be too if I had to live in such a place.

Id: [0x00059FDB]
Don't know why so many refuse to throw in with us. Life in the cities is much more pleasant. Can you imagine? Ground for a mattress. Canopy of leaves for a roof. It's barbaric.

Id: [0x00059FDD]
With the French pushed back there'll be a lot of opportunities for us up north.

Id: [0x00059FDE]
I hear the beaver pelts they gather fetch a fine price back home.

Id: [0x00059FDF]
Aye - but for all the riches one might claim, the winter waits to take it all away.

Id: [0x00059FE0]
Come now, it can't be that bad. Else the frogs wouldn't have lasted this long.

Id: [0x00059FE1]
Oh - don't you know? King Louis filled the place with whores to keep his men from turning tail.

Id: [0x00059FE2]
What?

Id: [0x00059FE3]
Aye. Loaded up a dozen boats with the finest Paris had to offer. Called 'em the King's Daughters, they did. Sent to warm the men in ways the campfires couldn't.

Id: [0x00059FE6]
I don't believe a word of it. Much as I'd like to...

Id: [0x00059FE7]
If Braddock's mission is successful, we'll get to see for ourselves soon enough. Then we'll know the truth of it.

Id: [0x00059FFB]
Master Kenway. Did you find it, then?

Id: [0x0005A000]
It was not the right place.

Id: [0x0005A003]
The others are waiting for you.

Id: [0x0005A00A]
Gentlemen.

Id: [0x0005A00C]
Please, sit.

Id: [0x0005A00E]
I fear our "temple" was no more than a painted cave. Although it did contain precursor images and script, which means we are close.

Id: [0x0005A00F]
Not close 'nuff it seems.

Id: [0x0005A010]
We need to redouble our efforts and expand our order, and establish a permanent base here. Although the site eludes us, I am confident we will find it.

Id: [0x0005A011]
Truth!

Id: [0x0005A012]
Hear-hear!

Id: [0x0005A013]
Furthermore, I believe it is time we welcomed Charles into our fold. He has proven himself a loyal disciple ‚Äì and served unerringly since the day he came to us. He should be able to share in our knowledge and reap all the benefits such a gift implies. [a beat]Are any opposed?

Id: [0x0005A015]
Very well. Charles, come, stand.

Id: [0x0005A017]
Do you swear to uphold the principles of our order and all that for which we stand?

Id: [0x0005A018]
I do.

Id: [0x0005A019]
And never to share our secrets nor divulge the true nature of our work?

Id: [0x0005A01A]
I do.

Id: [0x0005A01B]
And to do so from now until death - whatever the cost?

Id: [0x0005A01C]
I do.

Id: [0x0005A01E]
Then we welcome you into our fold, brother. Together we will usher in the dawn of a New World. One defined by purpose and order. [a beat]Give me your hand.

Id: [0x0005A020]
You are a Templar.

Id: [0x0005A023]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0005A025]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0005A026]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0005A027]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0005A028]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0005A029]
May the Father of Understanding guide us.

Id: [0x0005A02B]
Wait, what?!

Id: [0x0005A0EA]
Welcome back, Desmond! You'll be happy to hear there's actually good news for once.

Id: [0x0005A0EB]
Yeah?

Id: [0x0005A0EC]
I've managed to locate a power source. And it's relatively close by. Up for a trip to Manhattan?

Id: [0x0005A0ED]
Is it safe to leave? Abstergo's got to be looking for us.

Id: [0x0005A0EE]
Obviously it's not safe. We can't exactly sit around here hoping to get lucky, though can we? We need that power source. Besides, I'm sure you can cook up some way to hide our movements.

Id: [0x0005A0EF]
Maybe. The Templars have access to all kinds of satellites and camera systems. We'll need to find a way to mask our digital signature. I can probably camouflage the van too. But there's not much I can do for US.

Id: [0x0005A0F0]
That's an easy one.

Id: [0x0005A0F9]
Wonder what's inside...

Id: [0x0005A0FA]
Only one way to find out.

Id: [0x0005A0FE]
...when our first efforts failed us, we grew desperate and turned towards a more uncertain science... In these halls brave men and women worked to test the boundaries of what we knew... of what we were...

Id: [0x0005A103]
What is a fact? Is it fixed? Immutable? Certain in its existence and only awaiting discovery?

Id: [0x0005A105]
Or might it be changed? Here we learned the answer - and thought that it might save us.

Id: [0x0005A107]
They were used to command. To control. To own.

Id: [0x0005A110]
But we soon discovered another use. When enough sat in thrall and were told to believe, their thoughts took on form. What was imagined became real.

Id: [0x0005A114]
If a hundred minds could wish away a wall or create a tree, what might a thousand do? Ten thousand? More?

Id: [0x0005A116]
Might we change the consensus and will the threat away?

Id: [0x0005A118]
We resolved to send one into the sky where it might illuminate us all. Once placed, a sentence would be uttered:

Id: [0x0005A11A]
Make us safe.

Id: [0x0005A11C]
In this way we would change the consensus. We would save the world.

Id: [0x0005A11F]
But it never came to be. We sent a dozen of them skyward - but there was no way to maintain control. To direct the beam. To enthrall the world. To speak the words.

Id: [0x0005A122]
Though this was strange and dangerous - what we tried next was worse...

Id: [0x0005A126]
And so here we sought to see beyond ourselves - and know what was to come.

Id: [0x0005A127]
First we watched to learn if our work would succeed. But the answer was always the same.

Id: [0x0005A128]
So we moved on to other things, but she remained. The one you call Minerva.

Id: [0x0005A12A]
In time she too stopped looking - and instead began to speak.

Id: [0x0005A12B]
She called out across time, in the hopes that you might be saved. She hid messages where none might find them, save for you and those within this place...

Id: [0x0005A12E]
Our first instinct was to travel back. To change the past. But we could not find a way. But forward... We could look forward...

Id: [0x0005A7C0]
It's done.

Id: [0x0005A7CC]
Now I've upheld my part of the bargain. I expect that you will honor yours?

Id: [0x0005A7CE]
Follow me.

Id: [0x0005A7D1]
Excellent. Well the sooner we're done, the sooner we can get out of this cold.

Id: [0x0005A7D2]
See, Charles? We'll have Church in no time, just as I said we would.

Id: [0x0005B03A]
I don't trust you.

Id: [0x0005B03B]
I know.

Id: [0x0005B03C]
Yet you remain.

Id: [0x0005B03D]
That I might prove you wrong.

Id: [0x0005B03E]
It will not happen.

Id: [0x0005B03F]
So you say.

Id: [0x0005B040]
So I know.

Id: [0x0005B041]
Yet I remain.

Id: [0x0005B044]
What news?

Id: [0x0005B046]
Braddock has left to rally his troops. They're marching on Fort Duquesne. It'll be a while yet 'til they're ready, which gives us time to form a plan.

Id: [0x0005B048]
No need. We will ambush him here, near the river. Go and gather your allies. I will do the same. I will send word when it is time to strike.

Id: [0x0005B049]
That lobcock shouldn't be there!

Id: [0x0005B04A]
Well it IS there Mister Faulkner!

Id: [0x0005B090]
Hear, hear!

Id: [0x0005B094]
Hard at work, I see.

Id: [0x0005B096]
How did you...

Id: [0x0005B098]
It is time. We've set up camp to the north. Meet me there.

Id: [0x0005B09A]
Gentlemen!

Id: [0x0005B0A0]
Let us away.

Id: [0x0005B0A1]
First it was too cold. Now it's too god-damned hot!

Id: [0x0005B0A2]
And humid too! It's a right swamp, I tell you.

Id: [0x0005B0A3]
To say nothing of the mosquitoes.

Id: [0x0005B0A4]
Warm weather and bugs are soon to be the least of our worries.

Id: [0x0005B0A5]
Wot? Ya mean the Bulldog? Please. We'll be in that one's beef soon enough and onto the next.

Id: [0x0005B0A7]
Where's your boy Lee gone off to?

Id: [0x0005B0A8]
Returned to finish out his service under Braddock.

Id: [0x0005B0A9]
Which would give us a man inside.

Id: [0x0005B0AA]
Precisely.

Id: [0x0005B0AB]
Unless you've underestimated our enemy.

Id: [0x0005B0AC]
If I have, Charles will sense it first and make his escape. He's more clever than you think.

Id: [0x0005B0AD]
I imagine the Bulldog's none too pleased after the stunt we pulled.

Id: [0x0005B0AE]
Lee's to spin a tale of my incompetence and beg forgiveness. He's a way with words - especially when it comes to flattery. I expect he'll be welcomed back with open arms.

Id: [0x0005B0B0]
When this is done, I'm takin' a week in New York. It's high time I went and saw the sights.

Id: [0x0005B0B1]
Of empty whisky bottles and women's breeches, no doubt.

Id: [0x0005B0B2]
[laugh]Wot other kind of sights is worth seein'?

Id: [0x0005B0B5]
The woods here are quite beautiful. Shame that one day they'll be gone. Destroyed in the name of civilization...

Id: [0x0005B0B6]
Would you have us live among them, then? No thank you. It isn't dignified.

Id: [0x0005B0B7]
In this we disagree. To live in harmony and balance is something to which all should aspire.

Id: [0x0005B0B8]
Rocks for a mattress? Stars instead of candles? Uch. And who knows what foul things roam this place come night. I'll take four walls and a cobbled street any day. Cleaner and safer that way.

Id: [0x0005B139]
If I may... I was curious about your past with Braddock. You two clearly have a history.

Id: [0x0005B13A]
Edward was one of us, upon a time. And I considered him a close friend. He was brave and bold in ways few men are. But everything changed at the siege of Bergen op Zoom.

Id: [0x0005B13E]
We had lost the fortress to the French and were in the midst of egress. There was a skiff hidden at port, with which we planned to make our escape. As we drew near a young man and his family came upon us, begging for safe passage. I consented, but Edward refused. The young man called him craven, then... So Edward killed him and all the rest. Even the children.

Id: [0x0005B146]
To this day I don't know why... Was this the first time he'd struck out? Or had I simply never seen it before? Either way, things were never the same after that. We campaigned together a few more times but each outing was more disturbing than the last. He killed and killed. Enemy or ally. Civilian or Soldier. Guilty or Innocent. It mattered not. If he perceived one to be an obstacle, they died. He maintained that violence was a more efficient solution. It became his mantra. [a beat]And it broke my heart.

Id: [0x0005B148]
I had no idea...

Id: [0x0005B149]
He hides it well - and intimidates into silence any who discover him. Those who persist have a tendency to find misfortune.

Id: [0x0005B14A]
We should stop him.

Id: [0x0005B14B]
I suppose you're right... But I maintain a foolish hope that he might yet be saved and brought back round to reason. I know, I know... it's a silly thing to believe that one so drenched in death might suddenly change.

Id: [0x0005B14D]
I am sorry to have brought this up. It was not my intent to sour you.

Id: [0x0005B14F]
Nonsense. We are brothers now. There should be no secrets between us.

Id: [0x0005B158]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0005B15A]
Connor? Why are you poking around my camp?

Id: [0x0005B15C]
Can I help you, Connor? Is this something to do with Norris?

Id: [0x0005B160]
Prudence!

Id: [0x0005B162]
Prudence where are you?

Id: [0x0005B164]
Prudence is missing. She went out to gather some things this morning and never returned. I'm worried sick. What if she's hurt?

Id: [0x0005B16E]
Recall what happened as best you can.

Id: [0x0005B16F]
There were... three, no four of them. All of clearly ill repute. They carried a fifth. He was bruised and unconscious. Thomas, the fool, tried to offer aid. So they cut his throat. And then they moved on. As if it were nothing. As if it were normal!

Id: [0x0005B170]
Which way did they go?

Id: [0x0005B171]
I... I don't know. I was focused on trying to stop the bleeding...

Id: [0x0005B173]
Come on now, try and remember.

Id: [0x0005B175]
That way... I think.

Id: [0x0005B178]
I've asked the criers, but they all plead ignorance.

Id: [0x0005B179]
Bugger that! They're lying.

Id: [0x0005B17A]
Aye. What can I do? Threats slide off them and I'll not deign to grovel.

Id: [0x0005B17F]
Do tell.

Id: [0x0005B180]
It was down by the Church. A group of men comes rushing through when one of them suddenly falls to the ground - all torn up. I thought about going to see if he needed help, but a look from one of them changed my mind.

Id: [0x0005B182]
Probably for the best. Those aren't the sort of people you want to get mixed up with.

Id: [0x0005B183]
Who will emerge the victor?

Id: [0x0005B184]
This business with Silas confuses me. If Britain stands any chance of pushing back the French they must ALLY with the natives - not enslave them.

Id: [0x0005B185]
Silas is loyal only to his purse. That his actions harm the Crown is irrelevant. So long as there are buyers for his product, he'll continue to procure it.

Id: [0x0005B186]
All the more reason to stop him, then.

Id: [0x0005B187]
[a sigh]My days are spent in congress with the locals - attempting to convince them that we're the ones they should trust. That the French are merely using them as tools, to be abandoned once they've won.

Id: [0x0005B188]
Your words must lose their strength when held against the reality of Silas' actions.

Id: [0x0005B189]
I've tried to explain that he does not represent us. But he wears the red coat. He commands a fort. [a sigh]I must appear to them either a liar or a fool... Likely both.

Id: [0x0005B18A]
Take heart, brother. When we deliver them his head, they'll know your words were true.

Id: [0x0005B190]
The Abenaki. The Lenape. The Shawnee.

Id: [0x0005B199]
This must not come to pass! We must sever the cord and send them back! This is why we ride. To offer them one last chance: The French will leave or they will die!

Id: [0x0005B21F]
Come. I'll show you how.

Id: [0x0005B221]
Sir?

Id: [0x0005B223]
I'll arrange for horses while you do that.

Id: [0x0005B224]
Charles - you and William will serve as vanguard. Let no man reach us.

Id: [0x0005B228]
You and John will follow from a distance and keep watch over us. I'll signal you when I have need of your services.

Id: [0x0005B229]
Wot about me?

Id: [0x0005B232]
All clear!

Id: [0x0005B238]
Follow.

Id: [0x0005B24D]
Engage the enemy!

Id: [0x0005B24F]
Here they come!

Id: [0x0005B251]
Let no man reach us!

Id: [0x0005B253]
Defend the wagon at all costs!

Id: [0x0005B255]
On your guard, men!

Id: [0x0005B259]
That one's mine!

Id: [0x0005B25B]
This would have been a better post for Hickey... He seems at home amongst filth and rot.

Id: [0x0005B25D]
The smell... It penetrates my very bones. I fear no amount of washing shall ever rid me of it...

Id: [0x0005B25F]
What were they keeping in here? Oh... dear God. Was it used to sop a privy? Is that it?

Id: [0x0005B261]
You shoulda run, boy!

Id: [0x0005B263]
Looks like you're ta meet the reaper!

Id: [0x0005B265]
Away with you! Away!

Id: [0x0005B267]
You'll not have us!

Id: [0x0005B269]
To arms!

Id: [0x0005B26B]
For the Order!

Id: [0x0005B26D]
My blade strikes true!

Id: [0x0005B26F]
We shall be victorious!

Id: [0x0005B274]
I'll take of this, sir!

Id: [0x0005B276]
Your life is forfeit!

Id: [0x0005B278]
None shall breach our defenses!

Id: [0x0005B27B]
Come on, then! Let's see how tough you are.

Id: [0x0005B27D]
I'm gonna enjoy this!

Id: [0x0005B27F]
Hopefully this one's got some coins in 'is pockets...

Id: [0x0005B281]
Just a little closer and we'll have this sorted...

Id: [0x0005B289]
Sir - we've enemies ahead. Shall I engage them?

Id: [0x0005B28A]
No. Let Jonathan and Thomas take care of it.

Id: [0x0005B28B]
As you wish.

Id: [0x0005B28D]
I hope Thomas can handle this...

Id: [0x0005B28E]
Have some faith, Charles.

Id: [0x0005B290]
Only say the word and I'll cut them down.

Id: [0x0005B291]
Hold your sword. I have a plan.

Id: [0x0005B294]
So take it up with Braddock.

Id: [0x0005B297]
Are you mad? I value my life!

Id: [0x0005B2C4]
Where would we go?

Id: [0x0005B2C5]
As it happens she still needs guns and the officers to command them. We'll launch straight away. Don't worry, lad, I'll make sure you sprout good sea legs.

Id: [0x0005B2CB]
Haul in the mainsail! Get up the rigging! Hand over fist! Come on, men!! Let's get her out where she needs to be!

Id: [0x0005B2CF]
Oh, hullo, Miss Mandy. You're looking every bit as ravishing as I remember.

Id: [0x0005B2D0]
After all these years you sail all the way to the Vineyard to pay me complements?

Id: [0x0005B2D1]
We're looking for David and Richard Clutterbuck.

Id: [0x0005B2D3]

Id: [0x0005B2D5]
Nah... between contracts at the moment.

Id: [0x0005B2D6]
Well, we're looking for gunnery officers. What would you two say to working with me again?

Id: [0x0005B2DA]
We'd be for gettin' into a few more scraps.

Id: [0x0005B2DB]
Good show!

Id: [0x0005B2DD]
The Aquila is a fine vessel. We're fitting all the guns as we speak...

Id: [0x0005B2DF]
...we do not lack for resources. When it comes time, a ship worthy of your ambition will be waiting for you.

Id: [0x0005B2E8]
Whoa whoa whoa! Not in here gentlemen. Better still, not at all. Bobby, take your friends and get out.

Id: [0x0005B2EA]
Let's go boys. Our guns ought to be ready. Come on.

Id: [0x0005B2F0]
Looks like a British frigate with half seas over. Should do nicely for a spot of target practice. Bring her around broad side and when all guns are on target call 'fire'.

Id: [0x0005B2F3]
Good! Now give the swivel guns a turn. More precise. Hit those old powder barrels and light up the sky.

Id: [0x0005B2F5]
Not bad for a spud, cap'n!

Id: [0x0005B2FB]
Why is he shooting at us?!

Id: [0x0005B2FC]
Destroying property of the crown. Disturbing the King's peace. Take your pick.

Id: [0x0005B2FD]
What do we do?

Id: [0x0005B2FE]
Naught else to do but fight back! Sink the bastard!

Id: [0x0005B307]
Use the swivels on them, cap'n!

Id: [0x0005B30A]
With support like that the frigate's like to have some valuable cargo. We capture her.

Id: [0x0005B30B]
How?

Id: [0x0005B30C]
Take out the mainmast with chain shot and board her.

Id: [0x0005B30D]
Aye aye.

Id: [0x0005B311]
You'll sink her with that!

Id: [0x0005B313]
Use the chain shot, captain!

Id: [0x0005B318]
Brace!

Id: [0x0005B31C]
Take her a prize, men! Connor! Dispatch the captain and his lieutenants! We'll handle the rest!

Id: [0x0005B335]
Set sail. Due EAST. What the bloody hell was that about?

Id: [0x0005B336]
The older man is a Templar. Who was he with?

Id: [0x0005B337]
Nicholas Biddle? He's Nobody. Sails before the mast - midshipman for the Crown.

Id: [0x0005B338]
Are the guns ready?

Id: [0x0005B339]
Aye, but we won't jump in over our heads. We'll find a suitable target and show you how they work. We've fitted her with a modest amount of guns to start but rest assured there's ample room to add more should you feel the need.

Id: [0x0005B7D5]
Drats! Where'd this fog come from?! We best make haste, captain or we'll lose 'em in this soup.

Id: [0x0005B7D6]
ROGUE WAVE! Turn into it, captain! Frontal bash!

Id: [0x0005B7D9]
Well done, sir. That could have been ugly.

Id: [0x0005B7DB]
Another, captain. She's all yours.

Id: [0x0005B7DE]
Heavy gusts captain! Hard counter!

Id: [0x0005B7E0]
That wind'll push us hard-up those rocks! Veer off!

Id: [0x0005B7E3]
You want the Aquila hard and fast?

Id: [0x0005B7E5]
Fight the gale captain! Or we'll run aground!

Id: [0x0005B82E]
You're connected to her now- Listen and feel. She's idle. If you call for half sail, the men'll hop to it and she'll pick up.

Id: [0x0005B830]
Go on, boy!

Id: [0x0005B832]
Call for half sail, Connor.

Id: [0x0005B834]
Don't be an idler, call for half sail!

Id: [0x0005B835]
Half sail!

Id: [0x0005B837]
Enjoy this stretch of open water 'fore we come upon those shallows.

Id: [0x0005B839]
Try her at full sail.

Id: [0x0005B83A]
Now take us through these shallows. Careful not to run up on 'em. The sandbars'll slow us down but the rocks'll put a hole through her hull.

Id: [0x0005B83E]
There's enough sea room on either side of that outcropping but best head to the portside, looks like it's an easier course than the starboard path.

We'll move faster on horseback.

Id: [0x0005B88D]
Sir?

Id: [0x0005B88F]
Take the reins when you're ready and we'll depart.

Id: [0x0005B892]
Take care, sir. These woods are host to all manner of dangerous things...

Id: [0x0005B894]
Is there a problem, sir?

Id: [0x0005B896]
It will be faster if we remain mounted...

Id: [0x0005B898]
We should stay with the horses...

Id: [0x0005B89A]
We'll lose too much time if we proceed on foot.

Id: [0x0005B89C]
Come back, sir!

Id: [0x0005B89E]
We're fighting the wind, Connor. Head off a few degrees to regain your tack.

Id: [0x0005B8A0]
Port side looked fairer. You'll have to pick through some tricky rocks now.

Id: [0x0005B8A2]
Cottages. We're close.

Id: [0x0005B8A6]
Drop anchor. We'll go ashore, buy our guns and find our officers.

Id: [0x0005B8F0]
Round shot for a start!

Id: [0x0005B8F2]
Said ROUND shot, cap'n!

Id: [0x0005B8F4]
Round shot, sir!

Id: [0x0005B8F6]
Well done boy! Now aim all guns at her bow and do as much damage as possible.

Id: [0x0005B8F9]
Everything at her bow.

Id: [0x0005B8FB]
Give us the order and we'll focus on her bow.

Id: [0x0005B8FD]
Some ol' powder in there.

Id: [0x0005B8FF]
Use the swivels boy.

Id: [0x0005B901]
Take out those kegs with the swivels.

Id: [0x0005B903]
Woooo! Ne'er gets old.

Id: [0x0005B904]
[laugh]You are a fast learner.

Id: [0x0005B905]
Provided something interests me.

Id: [0x0005B90E]
Hey! Heeeeelp!

Id: [0x0005B910]
You, Sir, please! Help! He's going to die!

Id: [0x0005B911]
Who?

Id: [0x0005B912]
There's no time! Please come!

Id: [0x0005B914]
Follow me! He's in danger!

Id: [0x0005B918]
PLEASE! Hurry!

Id: [0x0005B91A]
No time to dawdle! The water moves quick!

Id: [0x0005B91B]
What happened?

Id: [0x0005B91C]
My partner Terry... was wrangling some logs on the river and he went in!

Id: [0x0005B91E]
Where is he?

Id: [0x0005B91F]
Down there! He's just passed under the bridge!

Id: [0x0005B921]
Hurry! He's almost at the falls!

Id: [0x0005B922]
Help me! Please!

Id: [0x0005B924]
Someone! Help! [swallows some water]

Id: [0x0005B925]
Arg! [coughs water]

Id: [0x0005B929]
[Cough]

Id: [0x0005B92A]
What this knob-end is trying to say is he's forever in your debt, sir.

Id: [0x0005B92C]
What were you doing on those logs?

Id: [0x0005B92D]
One of the dangers of lumberin'. We've got the camp set up a few rods off of here, as we're cuttin' timber. We're hoping to open a mill in the area.

Id: [0x0005B934]
There is a good place not far from the manor on the hill where I am staying.

Id: [0x0005B935]
Ha! I like you already. We'll have a look.

Id: [0x0005B93A]
Ah...getting a taste for the open sea are we? We'll make a jack tar out of you yet. Now we should be getting back. The Old Man is like to have my hide for keeping you out so long...

Id: [0x0005B93D]
...Kidd's legend tells of him being impervious to harm. But sailors like to embellish and they like to drink oft, making for tales taller than ships-of-the-line.

Id: [0x0005B93F]
Fort doesn't look as abandoned as it should. Looks occupied as can be.

Id: [0x0005B941]
Probably a gull or a rat...the only intruders we get here anyway. Preposterous. Send me across the ocean to play sentry on some meaningless isle. This is my last tour for a certainty. When I see the Captain I'll look him directly in the eyes and say "Sir! I am going home. I have had enough of these nonsense assignments".

Id: [0x0005B942]
Come off it. And keep watch.

Id: [0x0005B944]
Not a day passes without me overhearing you lot complaining of this assignment. 'The fort is meaningless', 'command is punishing the Captain for what happened in Poland'. I have had enough! We are here- under orders, I need not remind you- to hold Fort Wolcott against the rebels at all costs. And that is all that need concern you. You are not trained to comment on strategy nor are you aware of rebel movements. So put a stop to it! The next man I hear questioning the validity of our post will receive 10 lashes and 7 days in the old dungeon- without rations. Is that clear?

Id: [0x0005B945]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005B946]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005B947]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005B948]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005B949]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005B94A]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005B967]
We're under attack!!

Id: [0x0005B968]
Captain's dead! Cut down by cannon shot!

Id: [0x0005B969]
Ahhhh!

Id: [0x0005B96D]
Rebel! Bring him down!

Id: [0x0005B96E]
For the Captain!

Id: [0x0005B978]
The manor needs a lot of work.

Id: [0x0005B97B]
I found 'em! People say they's a myth but I 'ave 'em! Cap'n Kidd had a secret to be sure. Jus' get me a ship and a crew and we'll find out what it was he held so dear.

Id: [0x0005B991]
Board the Randolph!

Id: [0x0005B993]
Capture her men!

Id: [0x0005B995]
Over the rails!

Id: [0x0005B997]
Ready the grapples, men!

Id: [0x0005B999]
Hook us in! Bring her close!

Id: [0x0005B99B]
Secure the aft lines!

Id: [0x0005B99D]
Tie off the bow!

Id: [0x0005B99F]
To arms! To arms!

Id: [0x0005B9A1]
Snipers up the main mast!

Id: [0x0005B9A3]
Man the swivels! Cover from the quarter deck!

Id: [0x0005B9A5]
Arg!

Id: [0x0005B9CC]
Come on, brother! Dodge, dodge!

Id: [0x0005B9CD]
Give 'im a dowse on the chops!

Id: [0x0005B9D0]
So I thought. And yet, here you are.

Id: [0x0005B9D1]
Fancy yourself a joker, eh? Let's see how funny you find this.

Id: [0x0005B9D4]
Please fellas - call this off. If the captain sees us -

Id: [0x0005B9D7]
I'm ready ta go again if you are.

Id: [0x0005B9DB]
Hah! Hardly felt a thing!

Id: [0x0005B9E3]
What's the meaning of this?!

Id: [0x0005B9E6]
Explain yourself at once, Mister Kenway!

Id: [0x0005B9E8]
We were simply passing the time with a bit of sport, Captain.

Id: [0x0005B9EA]
How about you pass the time by doing your god-damned jobs instead?! I wasn't aware I was paying you to loll about!

Id: [0x0005BA18]
A word doctor, if you have a moment?

Id: [0x0005BA19]
You sound just like James. Like I told him, I've been much too busy with my research to notice anything not work-related.

Id: [0x0005BA1A]
Hello. Spare a minute?

Id: [0x0005BA1B]
Can't right now. Got a ship to sail, in case you hadn't noticed.

Id: [0x0005BA1D]
Excuse me, I was wondering if I might have a word?

Id: [0x0005BA1E]
Don't know nothing 'bout nothing.

Id: [0x0005BA1F]
Have a moment to talk?

Id: [0x0005BA20]
Can't say I do. Sorry.

Id: [0x0005BA21]
You there. I have some questions for you.

Id: [0x0005BA22]
That's nice. But I ain't got time to gossip. Probably wouldn't have anything useful to share anyway. You want information? Try the cook - or the doctor - everyone's always chatting them up.

Id: [0x0005BA25]
Actually I've come with a question.

Id: [0x0005BA26]
The boys cry about the rations, as if there's anything I can do about it. But beyond that I ain't heard much. My advice? Go find James. His ears are always open.

Id: [0x0005BA28]
Quite the basting you gave Graves and Quill.

Id: [0x0005BA2E]
Tell me you have found something?

Id: [0x0005BA2F]
I'm still working on it.

Id: [0x0005BA3B]
Some of the men have been gathering at night on the upper deck. I've only caught bits of their conversations - so I couldn't say for certain what they're up to. But I suspect it bodes ill...

Id: [0x0005BA44]
Evening, sir.

Id: [0x0005BA47]
How are things?

Id: [0x0005BA4A]
Calm and quiet - just the way I like it.

Id: [0x0005BBF6]
Ship sighted aft! She's making ready to fire!

Id: [0x0005BC01]
Brace! Everybody down!

Id: [0x0005BC03]
A warning shot. It seems they don't mean to sink us, but board us instead.

Id: [0x0005BC16]
Never!

Id: [0x0005BC1C]
I did as you asked, only Mills was there waiting for me. He's the one that drew that ship here. There was no mutiny - only him.

Id: [0x0005BC1E]
Me.

Id: [0x0005BC24]
It's our only chance.

Id: [0x0005BC35]
We need more speed! Loose the sails! Haytham - you take the foremast. James - to the main mast with you!

Id: [0x0005BC40]
Help! Please!

Id: [0x0005BC42]
The rope's too wet! I'm slipping!

Id: [0x0005BC45]
Thank you! Thank you!

Id: [0x0005BC54]
Some fresh air might do me good...

Id: [0x0005BC57]
Finish the hoddy doddy!

Id: [0x0005BC58]
[laughing]Look at how 'e bumbles about. Pathetic!

Id: [0x0005BC59]
Anoint him with the oil of gladness already. I want my money!

Id: [0x0005BC5B]
You might want to head back to your quarters. Top deck's no place for Tender Parnells.

Id: [0x0005BC5E]
That's enough, Graves.

Id: [0x0005BC63]
This is unwise.

Id: [0x0005BC64]
Why's that? Ya think I'm afraid of ya?

Id: [0x0005BC65]
No. But you should be.

Id: [0x0005BC66]
Not so cocky now, are ya?

Id: [0x0005BC68]
[laugh]This is easier than I thought!

Id: [0x0005BC6A]
I almost feel bad for you. Almost.

Id: [0x0005BC6C]
You got lucky, that's all!

Id: [0x0005BC6E]
You'll pay for that!

Id: [0x0005BC70]
Do you yield?

Id: [0x0005BC71]
Never!

Id: [0x0005BC73]
How do you like these odds?

Id: [0x0005BC74]
Get 'im!

Id: [0x0005BC7B]
Captain.

Id: [0x0005BC7E]
Oh. I nearly forgot.

Id: [0x0005BC80]
There's your knife back.

Id: [0x0005BCB8]
Call for full sail if you like.

Id: [0x0005BCB9]
And if you want to make a quick tack, call for half sail- she's more maneuverable then.

Id: [0x0005BCBB]
You missed. Best bring her around again.

Id: [0x0005BCBD]
Try it again, boy. Come about and get all your muzzles on target.

Id: [0x0005BCBE]
English Frigate!

Id: [0x0005BCBF]
Where the in the bloody hell did she come from?!

Id: [0x0005BCC0]
I'll be betwattled, another one!

Id: [0x0005BCC2]
Her mast is almost down, boy! Just a few more!

Id: [0x0005BCC4]
We almost have her! Just a couple more volleys!

Id: [0x0005BCCA]
Run up along side her and we'll hook in.

Id: [0x0005BCCC]
Gunwale up and we'll rope her close.

Id: [0x0005BCCF]
Now we best be getting back or the Old Man will have my guts for garters.

Id: [0x0005BCDC]
To our advantage? How?

Id: [0x0005BCDD]
Shoot the bloomin' things with the swivels when our targets get too close.

Id: [0x0005BCDE]
Aye aye.

Id: [0x0005BCE8]
Where is the Randolph?

Id: [0x0005BCE9]
He's gone, captain. Cut and run. Left us to deal with this rabble. But this storm concerns me a great deal more!

Id: [0x0005BD3E]
He's cut our rations again! Claims we're not provisioned for such luxuries.

Id: [0x0005BD40]
You're not having second thoughts, are you?

Id: [0x0005BD42]
I know it needs ta be done. But...

Id: [0x0005BD46]
He's a shifty fella. Won't hardly take his hat off. Keeps his face hidden too - so we can't see 'im watching us, I reckon.

Id: [0x0005BD55]
What sort of trouble?

Id: [0x0005BD56]
Unusual complaints or grievances? Men taking issue with the Captain or the passengers?

Id: [0x0005BD68]
What news?

Id: [0x0005BD69]
None as yet, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x0005BD6B]
You must expose whatever they're plotting.

Id: [0x0005BD6C]
I will. And soon.

Id: [0x0005BD6E]
Any luck?

Id: [0x0005BD6F]
Your crew's a tight-lipped bunch, but I'll see what I can do...

Id: [0x0005BD81]
What was that?

Id: [0x0005BD85]
Any news?

Id: [0x0005BD86]
Each night it's the same. I scout one area and they drop the painted barrels from another. I'm going to need to recruit an extra pair of eyes. Maybe James or Mills.

Id: [0x0005BD89]
Beat to quarters, men! Ready the- [cannons]

Id: [0x0005BDA4]
Goddamit!

Id: [0x0005BDA6]
We need those ropes secured!

Id: [0x0005BDA7]
Calm yourself. I'll fix your sail for you.

Id: [0x0005BDAA]
Hurry! I can't hold on much longer!

Id: [0x0005BDAF]
Make ready for our arrival, men!

Id: [0x0005BDB8]
You wish us to sail INTO the storm?!

Id: [0x0005C1ED]
What are you doing, captain?! That ship needs our help!

Id: [0x0005C1EF]
Get after them, sir! They'll have her before long.

Id: [0x0005C211]
Wind looks to be shifting. Stay alert, Connor. Gusty winds can be difficult to manage.

Id: [0x0005C213]
Mind those other vessels. Hold your tack to keep your right of way.

Id: [0x0005C215]
Look out for those ships!

Id: [0x0005C217]
Mother Mary! Watch it! We just fixed her up!

Id: [0x0005C219]
Come on, Connor! Keep control of her!

Id: [0x0005C21A]
We've finished loading the cargo, sir. Ready to set sail at your command.

Id: [0x0005C21C]
Carry on, sailor. [to Connor]Not bad for your first voyage, eh boy?

Id: [0x0005C21E]
We must keep pace, captain!

Id: [0x0005C220]
We need to make ground! We can't help her from here!

Id: [0x0005C222]
Captain! Adjust our course! We need to catch them!

Id: [0x0005C224]
What are you doing!? We're supposed to protect her!

Id: [0x0005C226]
You'll sink her, captain.

Id: [0x0005C229]
Have you lost your mind? Why are you shooting at the merchant vessel?!

Id: [0x0005C22B]
We should get after those ships, captain. Lest we want them to come back.

Id: [0x0005C22D]
Wrong way, sir. We should make a course after those ships.

Id: [0x0005C230]
We can't take another hit like that captain! Steer away from them!

Id: [0x0005C232]
We need to dodge those mortars! Head clear of their splash down!

Id: [0x0005C234]
Gotta avoid the mortars, sir!

Id: [0x0005C236]
Now, Cap'n! While they reload!

Id: [0x0005C238]
Now's our chance, sir!

Id: [0x0005C23A]
Nice drivin' cap'n!

Id: [0x0005C23C]
Won't hit us with you at the helm, sir!

Id: [0x0005C23D]
Your orders?

Id: [0x0005C23E]
I need time to piece things together. We set a course for home.

Id: [0x0005C23F]
Aye aye.

Id: [0x0005D75F]
Aye, captain. I've got a monkey's fist in my gut.

Id: [0x0005D7B2]
The Belladonna's serving up that ship on a platter! Blow her to pieces!

Id: [0x0005D7B4]
HA HA! Nice sailin' by the Frenchie!

Id: [0x0005D7B6]
We have her pinned! Rip her to shreds!

Id: [0x0005D7B8]
The Bella's makin' this TOO easy!

Id: [0x0005D7BC]
Whose side are you on? Protect her!

Id: [0x0005D7BE]
Es tu serieux?! (Are you serious?) Stop them!

Id: [0x0005D7C0]
Capitaine!

Id: [0x0005D7C2]
Ha ha!

Id: [0x0005D7C4]
Come one, come all! We're waiting for you!

Id: [0x0005D7C6]
Enjoy the coral, you bastard!

Id: [0x0005D7C8]
Mon dieux! (My God!) Do not shoot the BELLADONNA!

Id: [0x0005D7CA]
Why are you shooting my ship! Stop!

Id: [0x0005D7CC]
Keep the guns off the Bella, sir.

Id: [0x0005D7CD]
Aye. We're sitting ducks on the pond in this soup and you can be sure they've more on the way.

Id: [0x0005D7CE]
But what can we do?

Id: [0x0005D7CF]
Naught but pray they don't find us again.

Id: [0x0005D7D1]
Why are there so many!?

Id: [0x0005D7D2]
It does not matter! We fight!

Id: [0x0005D7D4]
Weaken her with chain shot captain! You'll sink her with that!

Id: [0x0005D7D6]
Why are you ordering for round shot! We need to fire the chain!

Id: [0x0005D7D9]
Where are you going? You must board her!

Id: [0x0005D7DB]
There's no more out there, sir. We should turn and board the man-o-war.

Id: [0x0005D7DC]
The Bella's cannons can still fire. Trail that mother t'wards her.

Id: [0x0005D7DE]
Ha! I told you!

Id: [0x0005D7DF]
Je ne comprends pas! (I do not understand!) Why don't we just sink her?!

Id: [0x0005D7E0]
I need to know how they found us. How they knew about the Belladonna.

Id: [0x0005D7E1]
Why does it matter?

Id: [0x0005D7E2]
Shut your mouth! The captain says we board so we board!

Id: [0x0005D7E3]
She is incapacitated and vulnerable. Let him go. We will see each other again soon.

Id: [0x0005D7E7]
I suppose you're here on account of my letter. One of Biddle's men came through a few weeks back. From what he said, the Randolph is sailing for Barbados. One of Biddle's ships wrecked down there and he means to salvage her.

Id: [0x0005D7EB]
Haven't seen this much of each other since Carolina, Bobby.

Id: [0x0005D7EC]
We'll be getting on our way then, captain?

Id: [0x0005D7ED]
Leaving me again, Bobby? Just like old times.

Id: [0x0005D7EE]
It's not my choice, Miss Mandy. Never was. When my captain says we go, we go.

Id: [0x0005D7F1]
What should we do then?

Id: [0x0005DDB4]
We must get back in the fight, captain! She's taking a pounding!

Id: [0x0005DDB6]
Sir! We're out of range. Adjust your course.

Id: [0x0005DDB8]
Keep them off her, captain!

Id: [0x0005DDBA]
We need to take the focus! She can't take any more!

Id: [0x0005DDBC]
Wrong one sir! The BRITISH ships.

Id: [0x0005DDBE]
Don't fire on the merchant boat!

Id: [0x0005DDC0]
I never said we were leaving. The crew will need to load provisions and ready the Aquila for this fight. I will see to it.

Id: [0x0005DDC2]
A salute to us sir. They're safe. What now?

Id: [0x0005DDC4]
We have little choice!

Id: [0x0005DDC5]
Aye. Time your shots between the waves, sir! Then we MUST find shelter or it won't be cannon fire that ends us!

Id: [0x0005DDCD]
I have never seen weather like that.

Id: [0x0005DDCF]
That was some deft sailing, captain! I was watching from the gun deck.

Id: [0x0005DDD0]
What were you doing on the gun deck!? I told you to stay out of harm's way!

Id: [0x0005DDD1]
I'm fine, Bobby. Not to worry. The people of Nantucket are surely grateful. And so am I.

Id: [0x0005DDE1]
I'd say it's high time we find some cover from this storm captain!

Id: [0x0005DDE5]
Leaving home was harder than I thought. I expected the journey would fill me with a sort of pride. A sense of accomplishment. But whatever it was that carried me away from home soon fled, replaced by questions - and no small amount of doubt. Had I been too hasty? Had I made a mistake? [a beat]The others in the village - they thought this was something I wanted. Something I chose to do. But it never felt that way to me. No. It was not a choice. It was an obligation. Because if not me, then who?

Id: [0x0005DDFB]
Hey! What are you doing?! That's mine!

Id: [0x0005DDFD]
Stop thief!

Id: [0x0005DDFF]
Get back here, you addle-plot!!

Id: [0x0005DE01]
I'll have your head, scapegrace!

Id: [0x0005DE05]
Hello!

Id: [0x0005DE06]
Hello!

Id: [0x0005DE08]
You must be one of them native fellas. From the uh... what's it called... Iroquois tribe? Yeah. You from that?

Id: [0x0005DE0A]
Course not, Terry. Iroquois ain't a tribe.

Id: [0x0005DE0B]
Is so.

Id: [0x0005DE0C]
Is not! The Iroquois is a confederation.

Id: [0x0005DE0D]
Confeda-what-now?

Id: [0x0005DE0E]
Confederation, ya tony. It's a group. An alliance. Lotsa different kinds of people all united.

Id: [0x0005DE0F]
Right. Like I said. A tribe.

Id: [0x0005DE11]
Listen you totty-headed twiddle poop - there's a difference between a tribe and a confederation and it's not my fault your skull's too thick to make sense of it.

Id: [0x0005DE12]
Who you calling a twiddle poop, you crump-backed scab!

Id: [0x0005DE14]
Hey now! This is between me and him!

Id: [0x0005DE15]
Yeah! Mind your business!

Id: [0x0005DE17]
Just give it a few days. We'll tend to the wounded, resupply, and come up wit a plan... I've sent Enoch to scout the place, figure out the best way in...

Id: [0x0005DE18]
You hear 'im before? Sayin 'e as no master but 'imself? What a load of fee, faw, fum. If he ain't no master, guess he's ours to do wit as we please.

Id: [0x0005DE1B]
Private matters bein' discussed 'ere. Best you move along.

Id: [0x0005DE1D]
Won't warn you again...

Id: [0x0005DE29]
What?

Id: [0x0005DE2A]
Um... I... I was told you could train me

Id: [0x0005DE2C]
No.

Id: [0x0005DE2F]
Go away!

Id: [0x0005DE33]
I need a place to camp. This should do.

Id: [0x0005DE3B]
If you think I-

Id: [0x0005DE44]
There must be another way in...

Id: [0x0005DE48]
Please, all I ask is a moment of your time -

Id: [0x0005DE4A]
I apologize if I've been unclear - or otherwise confused you with my words. It was never my intention to mislead, So let me try to clarify: [a beat]GET THE HELL OFF MY LAND!

Id: [0x0005DE52]
Just hear me out?! What are you so afraid of?

Id: [0x0005DE54]
Afraid? You think I'm afraid of ANYTHING, least of all, a self-important little scab like you?!

Id: [0x0005DE56]
Oh, you might dream of being a hero. Of riding to rescues, of saving the world - but stay this course, and the only thing you're gonna be is DEAD.

Id: [0x0005DE58]
I will not leave! Do you hear me?! I am NEVER leaving!

Id: [0x0005DE5A]
Just wait old man...

Id: [0x0005DE5C]
I will not be defeated so easily...

Id: [0x0005DE5E]
You WILL train me... [a beat]You have to...

Id: [0x0005DE64]
He's a square toes - this'll be easy.

Id: [0x0005DE65]
That's what you said last time and I wound up with a dead 'orse an a dark eye.

Id: [0x0005DE67]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0005DE68]
No one you need concern yourself with, little breeches.

Id: [0x0005DE69]
Best cut 'fore something bad 'appens.

Id: [0x0005DE6A]
No.

Id: [0x0005DE6D]
Can't say we didn't warn ya.

Id: [0x0005DE70]
Oi! Brothers!

Set a course for Martha's Vineyard. We'll find our guns and officers there.

Id: [0x0005DEF4]
Double time! We'll get the whip if we're late for the captain's address!

Id: [0x0005DEFD]
Jackanape deserved everything he got. Won't tolerate such behavior. Let that be a lesson to the rest of you.

Id: [0x0005DEFE]
He didn't mean anything by what he said.

Id: [0x0005DEFF]
You getting soft?

Id: [0x0005DF04]
Catch!

Id: [0x0005DF12]
Check the dirt-sheet for duties and details for the coming week. B Company will be in drills and without rum rations until they PROPERLY execute formations two and three. Such sloppy marching will not be tolerated.

Id: [0x0005DF1A]
Rouse B company! To the battlements!

Id: [0x0005DF1C]
Move to the west wall!

Id: [0x0005DF1E]
Bloody hell! Where did they come from?!

Id: [0x0005DF20]
To the armory!

Id: [0x0005DF2A]
[Tho entkonhrh√°:reke. Takwahronk√†:ten n√≥:nen √©nhtsha.]I'll wait for you over there. Let me know when you're finished.

Who's in command?!

Id: [0x0005DF3F]
Form up! Form up!

Id: [0x0005DF40]
You're late, captain.

Id: [0x0005DF41]
Those occupying the fort were less than thrilled by my presence.

Id: [0x0005DF42]
And?

Id: [0x0005DF43]
And what?

Id: [0x0005DF44]
The damned scroll ya muckworm! Was it there?

Id: [0x0005DF45]
That it was, Mister Faulkner.

Id: [0x0005DF50]
Position two!

Id: [0x0005DF59]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005DF5A]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005DF5B]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005DF5C]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005DF5D]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005DF5E]
Yes sir!

Id: [0x0005DF61]
I just don't think it's right.

Id: [0x0005DF64]
I must hurry.

Id: [0x0005DF66]
I need to get to the Aquila.

Id: [0x0005DF8D]
Nice to see you, too.

Id: [0x0005E033]
I will get a better view from up there.

Id: [0x0005E034]
Move!

Id: [0x0005E035]
I will have to circle around to avoid the courtyard.

Id: [0x0005E037]
Yah yah.

Id: [0x0005E038]
I'm hurryin'! I'm hurryin'!

Id: [0x0005E039]
At ease. Grub is on its way.

Id: [0x0005E03A]
That lurcher is out of his head. Who would do that to a man? [takes a deep breath]That's why you don't let soldiers get bored.

Id: [0x0005E040]
I must move swiftly.

Id: [0x0005E042]
Fine shooting, Mister Clutterbuck.

Id: [0x0005E1D9]
Head below deck, Mandy. It's safer there.

Id: [0x0005E1DA]
Better hurry captain.

Id: [0x0005E1E0]
It's a bloody armada! I knew he was up to something! And he's turned to fight us- we're in it now, captain!

Id: [0x0005E1E1]
So we FIGHT Mister Faulkner! Board the Randolph. Sink the rest!

Id: [0x0005E1E2]
ARRRG!

Id: [0x0005E1E6]
Not yet, captain! We need to deal with his backup!

Id: [0x0005E1E8]
Sink the others first! We can't board yet.

Id: [0x0005E1EC]
[Singing]I've been a wild rover for many a year, and I spent all me money on whiskey and beer. And now I'm returning...

Id: [0x0005E1F1]
Not the round shot captain! The chain!

Id: [0x0005E1F3]
I thought you meant to board her! Use the chain shot!

Id: [0x0005E1F5]
Round shot will sink her, sir!

Id: [0x0005E1F7]
Where are you going? We must take the Randolph!

Id: [0x0005E1F9]
Adjust your course, captain. The Randolph is back that way!

Id: [0x0005E1FA]
I agree, Mister Faulkner! We make for the Vineyard.

Id: [0x0005E201]
Make haste captain, that merchant ship won't last long.

Id: [0x0005E203]
We better move.

Id: [0x0005E204]
Glad you're back.

Id: [0x0005E20E]
Is it a mutiny they're planning?

Id: [0x0005E20F]
All I know is they've little love for the captain. Mills has been trying to talk 'em down, but there's only so much one man can do.

Id: [0x0005E213]
Thank you for the information.

Id: [0x0005E214]
I only wish to see us reach the colonies alive.

Id: [0x0005E215]
Hmmm. The bench has been tampered with...

Id: [0x0005E218]
I can repair the other.

Id: [0x0005E21A]
Aye, aye!

Id: [0x0005E222]
Thought I'd wander a bit. Stretch my legs. That's all.

Id: [0x0005E22D]
There's a storm comin', captain. Feels like a big one.

Id: [0x0005E233]
You see the catchfart, cap'n?

Id: [0x0005E235]
There's nothing here...

Id: [0x0005E237]
This isn't relevant...

Id: [0x0005E239]
Seems to be in order...

Id: [0x0005E23B]
It's not too late for you to yield.

Id: [0x0005E23C]
So be it. I offered, you declined. My conscience is clear.

Id: [0x0005E244]
Get up the rigging! Secure that tackle!

Id: [0x0005E248]
Tighten the bindings!

Id: [0x0005E249]
Batten down the hatches!

Id: [0x0005E24A]
Heave on those aft lines! Heave!

Id: [0x0005E269]
Tenacious! Smart! Pity I have to kill you!

Id: [0x0005E26B]
Come on you savage! Give me your best!

Id: [0x0005E26D]
Your misplaced sense of justice is pathetic. You should have never set foot outside your little village.

Id: [0x0005E26F]
Mr. Kenway will reward me greatly for riding him of you.

Id: [0x0005E271]
I will make you suffer for the damage you've done to the Randolph!

Id: [0x0005E274]
Well played!

Id: [0x0005E276]
Nicely done!

Id: [0x0005E278]
Devious! I'm impressed.

Id: [0x0005E27A]
An excellent maneuver.

Id: [0x0005E27C]
A valiant attempt.

Id: [0x0005E280]
That's one less piece for you, I'm afraid.

Id: [0x0005E282]
Fear not, you can still turn things around!

Id: [0x0005E284]
Look at that! Well done!

Id: [0x0005E286]
You're a natural!

Id: [0x0005E288]
Good game, my friend.

Id: [0x0005E28A]
Better luck next time.

Id: [0x0005E28C]
Seems you need a bit more practice.

Id: [0x0005E28E]
No hard feelings I hope. You'll improve over time. I'm sure of it!

Id: [0x0005E290]
Would you like to try again?

Id: [0x0005E292]
Fancy another round?

Id: [0x0005E294]
Care for a rematch?

Id: [0x0005E296]
Excellent! I'll reset the board.

Id: [0x0005E298]
Of course. Another time, then.

Id: [0x0005E29D]
Mast is down! We got the cockrobin!

Id: [0x0005E2A1]
Engage the schooners first! We'll deal with the big fella after.

The gulls tell us all we need to know. Climb into the crow's nest and you'll see.

Id: [0x0005E2E1]
Ha ha! The Aquila flies again! D'ya feel it, lad?!

Id: [0x0005E2E2]
Looks like your friend's about to catch a beatin'.

Id: [0x0005E2E3]
I will need something to draw their attention, then. Once you lose sight of me, wait for ten minutes then bombard the fort. I will slip out under cover of the shelling.

Id: [0x0005E2E8]
Take it head on next time!

Id: [0x0005E2EA]
Mind your timing captain!

Id: [0x0005E2EC]
Fire in between the waves!

Id: [0x0005E302]
What are you standing around for? Get back to work!

Id: [0x0005E304]
I'll not tolerate idle hands! You've got a job to do!

Id: [0x0005E306]
You labor that you might be saved! So get to it!

Id: [0x0005E307]
Indeed. All in good time.

Id: [0x0005E30B]
Yield boy and we'll do ya quickly.

Id: [0x0005E30C]
You're only makin' things worse.

Id: [0x0005E30D]
Shoulda run when ya had the chance...

Id: [0x0005E30E]
Hah! Look at the savage dance!

Id: [0x0005E30F]
Songs and spirits can't save ya now!

Id: [0x0005E311]
Why are you here? What do you want?

Id: [0x0005E312]
Best ask the bossman.

Id: [0x0005E318]
You workin' for the old man, then? That it?

Id: [0x0005E31A]
Maybe this'll get ya talkin'.

Id: [0x0005E31C]
Oh.

Id: [0x0005E31E]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0005E32C]
Clean this up.

Id: [0x0005E331]
Sorry.

Id: [0x0005E333]
Not your fault. This whole place is ready to come down. Goddamn miracle it hasn't already. [a beat]Anyway, who are you?

Id: [0x0005E334]
My name is Ratohnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x0005E335]
Right. Well, I'm not even going to try and pronounce that. Now tell me why you're here.

Id: [0x0005E339]
I was told to seek this symbol.

Id: [0x0005E33B]
Do you even know what that symbol represents? Or what it is you're asking for?

Id: [0x0005E33C]
No.

Id: [0x0005E33D]
And yet here you are.

Id: [0x0005E33E]
The spirit said that - That I've -

Id: [0x0005E340]
These "spirits" of yours have been harassing the Assassins for centuries. Ever since Ezio uncorked the bottle... Ah - but you don't even know what an Assassin is, do you?

Id: [0x0005E342]
Well best settle in, then. I've got a story to tell and it's gonna take a while to get it all out...

Id: [0x0005E347]
...and so this is why the Assassins have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of the Templars. Because if they succeed - your spirit's visions will become reality.

Id: [0x0005E348]
Then I will stop them.

Id: [0x0005E349]
Oh I have no doubt you'll try.

Id: [0x0005E34B]
Come on. I've something to show you.

Id: [0x0005E34D]
Careful. Wasn't a joke when I said this place was coming apart.

Id: [0x0005E34E]
Why don't you repair it?

Id: [0x0005E34F]
What's the point? [a pause]Besides I don't have materials for the job.

Id: [0x0005E350]
So buy them.

Id: [0x0005E352]
[laugh]Look at me! You think I can just march into some store, purse full of pounds, and go shopping?

Id: [0x0005E353]
Yes. Why not?

Id: [0x0005E355]
So naive...

Id: [0x0005E357]
This way.

Id: [0x0005E35D]
Don't think you can just come in here, throw those on and call yourself an Assassin.

Id: [0x0005E35F]
I... did not... I would never presume...

Id: [0x0005E361]
That's alright. I know they've a certain allure.

Id: [0x0005E363]
Very well. I'll train you. Then we'll know if you've the right to wear those robes...

Id: [0x0005E365]
Thank you... uh...

Id: [0x0005E366]
Name's Achilles.

Id: [0x0005E368]
Come on, then. We've work to do.

Id: [0x0005E36C]
So I trained. In running. In climbing. In fighting. In falling. And for every lesson that concerned the body, there were two that concerned the mind. Language. Philosophy. Logic. The Arts... [a beat]Achilles taught most often of the Assassins and Templars. Their structures, origins, and purpose. Centuries of history condensed into a few short days... I told him of the men who had burned my village. Of Charles Lee and my promise to him. Achilles explained that Lee and his followers were Templars. And that they were led by none other than my own father. If I was to serve the Order, these men would become my targets. So I worked harder. Learned faster. But for all of my progress, it was clear that I still had much to learn. My training had only just begun.

Id: [0x0005E372]
Good morning.

Id: [0x0005E373]
To you as well.

Id: [0x0005E375]
You taking a trip?

Id: [0x0005E376]
I've decided  to do something about the house. And you're going to help me. Get in.

Id: [0x0005E37A]
Where do you want this delivered?

Id: [0x0005E37C]
Careful now... I'm here to help.

Id: [0x0005E382]
Don't stare.

Id: [0x0005E384]
Sorry.

Id: [0x0005E385]
Come on.

Id: [0x0005E387]
This place is incredible. The people. The sounds and smells. I could walk these streets for days and know not even half its wonders...

Id: [0x0005E388]
I thought the same as you upon a time. These days, I much prefer the quiet of the countryside.

Id: [0x0005E389]
But there is so much LIFE here. So many opportunities.

Id: [0x0005E38B]
For a few, my boy. For a few...

Id: [0x0005E38D]
There's a store close to here. You're to buy the items on this list. Tell them where the carriage is - and they'll see that's it loaded. Understood?

Id: [0x0005E38F]
Yes.

Id: [0x0005E390]
Good. You're also going to need a new name. Your skin is fair enough that you might pass for one with Spanish or Italian blood. Better to be thought a Spaniard than a Native. And both are better still than I.

Id: [0x0005E391]
That is not true.

Id: [0x0005E392]
What's TRUE and what IS aren't always the same.

Id: [0x0005E394]
What would you call me, then?

Id: [0x0005E396]
Connor. [a beat]Yes. That will be your name.

Id: [0x0005E398]
Alright then. Off you go.

Id: [0x0005E39C]
I grow tired of this! It seems each day a new tax is levied - a new rule enforced - all without our consent! The Revenue Act. The Indemnity Act. The Commissioners of Customs Act. Oh, Chancellor Townshend must have thought himself so clever when he papered these thefts and made them law. But the Constitution says we've a right to refuse! That there will be no taxation without representation! Tell me - who represented us in Parliament? Who spoke on our behalf? Signed in our stead? Give me a name! Only you can't! And do you know why? You can't tell me who represented us because nobody did!

Id: [0x0005E39E]
Who stands in Parliament for Boston? For New York? For Virginia? No one! But Old Sarum is represented. And Newport and Newtown. Seaford and Saltash. The list goes on. Rotten boroughs one and all. And yet there are men who speak for them. These places of no repute.

Id: [0x0005E3A0]
What is become of the Rights of Englishmen? Are we not entitled to have a say in our governance? Who are they to silence our voices? To insist we be represented by strangers?

Id: [0x0005E3A2]
Have you forgotten the Stamp Act and how we responded? We spoke up! We resisted! So they stood down! We were heard and it was repealed! But now... Now too many are silent. Or worse - they excuse it! The taxes are not so high, they say. The money is put to good use they say. Fie, I say! Fie we should ALL say! Though the taxes may be small, they were enacted and enforced without our consent. As to their use? They pay governors and judges! And if it's Britain pays them, it's Britain to whom they are beholden, not us! Do none see the danger here?

Id: [0x0005E3A9]
Will you be paying with coin or trade?

Id: [0x0005E3AD]
Some of these things I have. Some I don't. Lumber's hard to come by since my supplier up and vanished. I have the tools and pitch, though. Nails too.

Id: [0x0005E3AE]
Our wagon is near the state house.

Id: [0x0005E3CE]
I should return to Achilles...

Id: [0x0005E3D1]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0005E3D2]
Trouble at the Custom House! 'Prentice Gerrick was beaten by a Lobsterback!

Id: [0x0005E3D3]
Tory bastards think they can do as they please! It's time we took a stand!

Id: [0x0005E3D6]
What happened?

Id: [0x0005E3D7]
That's what we're going to find out. Follow me.

Id: [0x0005E3DB]
I say again: disperse! Congregating in this manner is forbidden!

Id: [0x0005E3DD]
We're not going anywhere, bug!

Id: [0x0005E3DE]
Oi! Why don't you go back to England?!

Id: [0x0005E3E0]
No good can come of this chaos! Return to your homes and all will be forgiven!

Id: [0x0005E3E2]
Never!

Id: [0x0005E3E3]
Not until you've answered for your crimes!

Id: [0x0005E3E4]
You're right cowards, pointing guns at unarmed folk!

Id: [0x0005E3E5]
You don't scare us!

Id: [0x0005E3E6]
We ain't afraid!

Id: [0x0005E3E8]
There!

Id: [0x0005E3EA]
Is that my father...?

Id: [0x0005E3EC]
Yes. Which means trouble is sure to follow.

Id: [0x0005E3ED]
But -

Id: [0x0005E3EE]
But nothing!

Id: [0x0005E3F6]
Oi! You there. What's all the fuss about?

Id: [0x0005E3F7]
Fire at the Town House...

Id: [0x0005E408]
Come no closer.

Id: [0x0005E409]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0005E40B]
Making history.

Id: [0x0005E40D]
Your plot has ended.

Id: [0x0005E40E]
Not quite...

Id: [0x0005E411]
Damn you, fire!

Id: [0x0005E417]
I need to find Achilles...

Id: [0x0005E419]
You there!

Id: [0x0005E41A]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0005E41B]
Just a messenger. Mister Adams wants a word.

Id: [0x0005E41C]
What? Why?

Id: [0x0005E41D]
You'll need ask him that yourself. He'll meet you tonight near Faneuil Hall. I suggest laying low until then.

Id: [0x0005E421]
Over here!

Id: [0x0005E423]
You're Achilles' boy. Connor, was it? I saw what happened at the Town House. A fine mess, that.

Id: [0x0005E424]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0005E425]
Samuel Adams, at your service.

Id: [0x0005E42F]
Achilles asked me to get you out of Boston.

Id: [0x0005E430]
Explain.

Id: [0x0005E432]
The whole city's looking for you...

Id: [0x0005E435]
Oye! Oye! A criminal stalks the streets - wanted in connection with the massacre at the Town House! Citizens are advised to call the guards if they see him! Ten pounds to whoever brings this madman to justice!

Id: [0x0005E437]
What am I supposed to do?

Id: [0x0005E43A]
You can take down these posters for a start.

Id: [0x0005E444]
We can't be seen together until these posters are gone...

Id: [0x0005E446]
Take down those posters and then we'll talk...

Id: [0x0005E448]
I've nothing more to say so long as those posters remain...

Id: [0x0005E44B]
If it gets any colder, my nutmegs are apt to snap off.

Id: [0x0005E44C]
What a beautiful picture you've painted for me. Thank you kindly for that.

Id: [0x0005E44E]
If they haven't caught the man who took the first shot by now, I can't imagine they ever will...

Id: [0x0005E44F]
Aye. It's unlikely... But for a purse of 50 pounds no harm in keeping an eye out.

Id: [0x0005E451]
I heard it was an Indian fella did it.

Id: [0x0005E452]
Shoulda just cleared 'em all out after we pushed back the French.

Id: [0x0005E453]
They can't be trusted.

Id: [0x0005E454]
No sense of honor. Not like us Englishmen, eh?

Id: [0x0005E456]
What will you do if you collect the bounty?

Id: [0x0005E457]
Got me eye on a cottage out by the Charles. Phoebe's been talking about having a child. Maybe open up a store when my service is up.

Id: [0x0005E458]
IF your service is up. What happened today... it doesn't bode well. Not for any of us.

Id: [0x0005E459]
Aye. Saw me own brother in a crowd. I'll be needing to have a talk with him about that... Such protestations are downright dangerous these days.

Id: [0x0005E45A]
I can't help but fear we're headed towards a civil war...

Id: [0x0005E45C]
Was a mistake to let any of those troublemakers go. Should've silenced them all and been done with it.

Id: [0x0005E45D]
What? And have more martyrs for their cause? No. It was a mistake for them to fire at all.

Id: [0x0005E45E]
Are you mad? They'll see they can get away with it now. To stand down is to concede. We've empowered them!

Id: [0x0005E45F]
We empowered them when the men opened fire.

Id: [0x0005E460]
The protestors shot first!

Id: [0x0005E461]
See how much that matters in the days to come. As they parade their dead and curse our names.

Id: [0x0005E463]
I don't like this... With no forum to air their grievances it's little wonder the citizens have begun to cry out.

Id: [0x0005E464]
Seditious words, my friend. Take care not to speak them in the wrong company.

Id: [0x0005E465]
I know... I know... Still, I can't help but feel today makes their argument that much stronger. The colonies lack representation. Even the local government belongs to Britain. And so now we see what happens when the people lose their voice.

Id: [0x0005E467]
None can say for certain who fired the first shot, but we now suspect a man of native origin. Many speculate as to why he acted. A show of solidarity with the protesters? Vengeance for an attack on his people? Or was it merely an act of madness? I fear we shall have no answers until he is in custody. So long as he still walks the streets, ALL of us are in danger...

Id: [0x0005E46B]
Ah, Connor, there you are. I'd like you to meet Cyrus.

Id: [0x0005E46D]
Is it... Is he the killer?

Id: [0x0005E470]
Peace. Cyrus is on our side. Or rather... for the right price, he will be.

Id: [0x0005E472]
Have you seen this man?

Id: [0x0005E479]
Watch and learn.

Id: [0x0005E47B]
Oye! Oye! Word has reached us that the man responsible for today's shooting may have been in disguise! A wig and makeup tin were found near the scene of the crime. Witnesses describe a middle-aged gentleman of pale complexion fleeing towards the wharves, rifle in arm.

Id: [0x0005E47E]
Thank you kindly, Cyrus.

Id: [0x0005E47F]
Pleasure.

Id: [0x0005E482]
Come on, then. There's still one last bit of work to do.

Id: [0x0005E485]
Where are we going?

Id: [0x0005E486]
To the printer. Where do you think all those posters came from? They're made by a machine. We need to shut it down.

Id: [0x0005E48C]
Dammit! We're too late. They've set up a checkpoint. Come on. This way.

Id: [0x0005E490]
I can go by rooftop and meet you there?

Id: [0x0005E491]
No. Better you learn about the tunnels now.

Id: [0x0005E492]
Tunnels?

Id: [0x0005E493]
The Masons have a whole network of them under the city. They're quite useful when speed and secrecy are required.

Id: [0x0005E495]
Careful now... there's a patrol coming.

Id: [0x0005E497]
Head down, Connor. Don't let those Redcoats see you...

Id: [0x0005E499]
Mind the guards. We should keep our distance.

Id: [0x0005E49B]
Leave him be! He's just a child!

Id: [0x0005E49D]
Unhand that boy or I'll see to it the whole city knows of your crimes!

Id: [0x0005E49F]
You've no right to treat him that way!

Id: [0x0005E4A1]
He's done no wrong! Let him alone!

Id: [0x0005E4A4]
Another patrol! Don't make eye contact...

Id: [0x0005E4A6]
We're safe now. Come along.

Id: [0x0005E4AB]
Here we are, then. I'll see you inside.

Id: [0x0005E4AF]
Hold on.

Id: [0x0005E4B3]
The architecture is incredible...

Id: [0x0005E4B4]
Well, they're said to descend from stonemasons. Only natural then that they'd show off their abilities.

Id: [0x0005E4B6]
I wonder why they built these tunnels...

Id: [0x0005E4B7]
Couldn't tell you. It was a happy accident I even found them. There are plaques on the walls here and there - covered in some ciphered script. Perhaps they hold the answer.

Id: [0x0005E4B8]
I should like to learn their secrets.

Id: [0x0005E4B9]
Such pursuits will have to wait, I'm afraid. Or have you forgotten you're a fugitive?

Id: [0x0005E4BC]
I never was very fond of these tunnels... Useful, yes. But unsettling as well.

Id: [0x0005E4BE]
What might lie in wait within the walls... Or worse yet, creep above us...

Id: [0x0005E4C0]
Spiders seem to delight in descending just as I pass beneath them... To tangle themselves in my hair or skitter across my face...

Id: [0x0005E4C2]
What if one mistakes my ear for some dark hole within which to lay its eggs... Be vigilant Connor, lest you become a spawning ground as well!

Id: [0x0005E4C6]
Rats are nasty things, wouldn't you agree? Gorging themselves on filth and rot. Filling themselves with devious poison... Death delivered in a single bite.

Id: [0x0005E4C8]
And those squeals... As though they've heard the gates of hell swing open and desire to share its ghastly music with us all...

Id: [0x0005E4CB]
Take care not to wander too far. Wouldn't want us getting lost, never to be seen again...

Id: [0x0005E4F5]
We must stay vigilant, Connor. Down here, everything starts to look the same after a while...

Id: [0x0005E4F9]
No doubt the design is intentional - to confound interlopers and trap those who have no business being down here. Clever and cruel.

Id: [0x0005E4FD]
Use your lantern to light the lamps, Connor. They'll help us find our way should we get turned around.

Id: [0x0005E4FF]
Excellent. Let us move on.

Id: [0x0005E503]
Uuuhh‚Ä¶ Much as it pains me to say it, we must follow the rats - as they often move in the direction of an exit.

Id: [0x0005E508]
Dammit! I fear we may be lost. Just give me a moment to get my bearings... I don't suppose you've any idea which way we should go?

Id: [0x0005E509]
The exit is that way.

Id: [0x0005E50A]
But how can you know?

Id: [0x0005E50B]
It is hard to explain. You just have to trust me...

Id: [0x0005E50D]
...as I have trusted you.

Id: [0x0005E511]
Well well! You were right. I apologize for ever doubting. No wonder Achilles has taken such an interest in you.

Id: [0x0005E513]
Arse!

Id: [0x0005E515]
I don't suppose lock-picking is part of your repertoire?

Id: [0x0005E516]
Well done! The printer isn't far. Let us reconvene there.

Id: [0x0005E51A]
You ask a great deal of me, Sam.

Id: [0x0005E51B]
I know... But I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important. [a beat]If it wasn't... vital.

Id: [0x0005E51E]
Fine. Just this once, though. In the future, such things will come at a price. Resetting the type is neither quick nor easy. To say nothing of the cost should I be discovered...

Id: [0x0005E51F]
I shall not forget this kindness.

Id: [0x0005E521]
Nor I.

Id: [0x0005E523]
His work will see your last little bit of notoriety erased. Come - I'll show you how to leave now that order's been restored.

Id: [0x0005E527]
So now you've had a chance to see how it all works. Untoward actions will upset the citizens and inevitably lead to the guards being called. Depending on the severity of your transgression, they may simply search a bit before giving up and returning to their posts. But should you offend them severely or repeatedly - they'll become much more aggressive in their pursuits.

Id: [0x0005E529]
I've shown you three ways to turn the tide. Remove wanted posters, bribe town criers, or visit a printer to create your own propaganda.

Id: [0x0005E52A]
This feels wrong. Why not just speak to someone and explain my innocence?

Id: [0x0005E52B]
You can't be serious?

Id: [0x0005E52C]
We counter one lie with another. Words on paper instantly taken as truth. And all of it without question.

Id: [0x0005E52D]
THEY loosed this beast - or have you  forgotten? I merely helped you tame and turn it 'round.

Id: [0x0005E52E]
There must be another way. Something more honest.

Id: [0x0005E52F]
Oh, when you find it, do let me know. But until then, we sculpt with the clay we have.

Id: [0x0005E530]
My apologies. I do not mean to sound ungrateful.

Id: [0x0005E531]
Quite alright. I was much the same at your age. You'll grow out of it...

Id: [0x0005E532]
And if I do not? If I refuse?

Id: [0x0005E533]
Then you'll likely wind up dead.

Id: [0x0005E536]
Here we are. Speak with the harbormaster and he'll see you home.

Id: [0x0005E537]
Thank you for everything, Sam. I promise one day to repay the favor.

Id: [0x0005E538]
Oh, I'm counting on it.

Id: [0x0005E53A]
Like this?

Id: [0x0005E542]
If you're going to stand a chance against the Templars, you're going to need these.

Id: [0x0005E544]
Go on. Before I change my mind.

Id: [0x0005E54A]
Put them on.

Id: [0x0005E551]
Once upon a time, we had a ceremony on such occasions. But I don't think either of us are really the type for that.

Id: [0x0005E553]
You've your tools and training. Your targets and goals. And now you have your title. Welcome to the Brotherhood, Connor.

Id: [0x0005E557]
Greetings guardian.

Id: [0x0005E55F]
Return to me once you've removed the others.

Id: [0x0005E560]
I have an idea.

Id: [0x0005E561]
Well let's 'ear it.

Id: [0x0005E563]
I'll kill the lookout and take up position BEHIND the guards. You two approach from the front. When I open fire on the group, you charge in. We'll have the element of surprise on our side. Half will fall before they've even realized what's happened.

Id: [0x0005E565]
Get into position. But WAIT for me to take the first shot.

Id: [0x0005E569]
You two - clear off!

Id: [0x0005E56A]
Go on now - 'fore you make us mad.

Id: [0x0005E56D]
So much for the element of surprise...

Id: [0x0005E56F]
Reinforcements!

Id: [0x0005E570]
Oi! 'Aytham! Shoot 'em 'for they reach us.

Id: [0x0005E571]
Use those spare muskets and you won't have to reload!

Id: [0x0005E573]
Fall back! Fall back! We'll be safe inside!

Id: [0x0005E575]
What now?

Id: [0x0005E578]
Guess they wasn't so safe inside after all...

Id: [0x0005E57B]
Best you return to Braddock, Charles, before he grows suspicious. I can handle things from here.

Id: [0x0005E57C]
But sir -

Id: [0x0005E57D]
But nothing. Go.

Id: [0x0005E60B]
Greetings! How fares the watch?

Id: [0x0005E60C]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0005E60D]
Thomas Smith. Newly recruited. Arrived from London just last week, in fact.

Id: [0x0005E60E]
And you're to patrol with us?

Id: [0x0005E60F]
So said Silas.

Id: [0x0005E610]
Hmmm.

Id: [0x0005E611]
I assume it's all rather straightforward? Watch for disturbances? Ensure order is maintained?

Id: [0x0005E612]
And keep away from the merchandise.

Id: [0x0005E613]
Merchandise?

Id: [0x0005E614]
If you don't know, you don't need to. Just do as you've been told and stay out of our way.

Id: [0x0005E615]
Of course.

Id: [0x0005E617]
I must say, the weather in Boston is much fairer than back home.

Id: [0x0005E618]
Wait until winter, and see if you still feel the same.

Id: [0x0005E619]
Or summer for that matter. The heat and wet... It suffocates a man.

Id: [0x0005E61A]
And these uniforms... clearly sewn for other climes. Too thin when it's cold - too heavy when it's hot.

Id: [0x0005E61C]
I assume it's quiet here most days?

Id: [0x0005E61D]
Aye. On occasion we'll catch a smuggler trying to ferry contraband into the city. A small fine and stern warning usually sets them right.

Id: [0x0005E61E]
Hmmm. A nice change of pace from the campaigning back home.

Id: [0x0005E61F]
Why do you think so many of us volunteered? Good pay - safe work - a chance to own some land.

Id: [0x0005E620]
The French would see an end to that!

Id: [0x0005E621]
I don't know. They seem content in the north. Sometimes I wonder if it's not we who provoke with our sorties and expeditions.

Id: [0x0005E622]
Hah! That's exactly what they want you to think...

Id: [0x0005E623]
Such a shame. The colonies are meant to be an opportunity - not another warfront...

Id: [0x0005E625]
Signal when you're ready to strike.

Id: [0x0005E626]
Go on, Haytham! We'll hold back the guards while you deal with Silas!

Id: [0x0005E628]
There's still time for you to flee... Though not much.

Id: [0x0005E62A]
With fighting skills like these, it's little wonder you were set to guard a fort!

Id: [0x0005E62C]
Where did you receive your training? DID you receive any training?

Id: [0x0005E62E]
This is the best Boston has to offer? No wonder the French still pose a threat...

Id: [0x0005E630]
Back, rogues! You shall not have us!

Id: [0x0005E632]
No mercy!

Id: [0x0005E634]
For the Order!

Id: [0x0005E636]
I'll deal with this, sir!

Id: [0x0005E651]
Everything is under control, sir! Continue with your mission!

Id: [0x0005E653]
To me, men!

Id: [0x0005E655]
Charles! Help me with this!

Id: [0x0005E657]
To my side, Thomas!

Id: [0x0005E659]
William! I need you here!

Id: [0x0005E65B]
Attack them, Jonathan! Attack!

Id: [0x0005E661]
Push them back!

Id: [0x0005E663]
Let us end this!

Id: [0x0005E665]
Brothers!

Id: [0x0005E668]
An hour of quiet was all I asked. Instead I'm awakened not ten minutes later by this cacophonous madness! I expect an explanation - and it had best be good!

Id: [0x0005E66A]
How?! How did this happen!? My precious merchandise set free?! It's unacceptable! Rest assured I'll have the heads of those responsible! But first... first we clean up this mess!

Id: [0x0005E673]
Seal the fort. Kill any who try to escape. I don't care if they be one of us or one of... [with disdain]them. To approach the gate is to be made a corpse! [a beat as he lets it register]Am I understood?

Id: [0x0005E677]
No man passes through the gates! Do you hear me?! NO MAN!

Id: [0x0005E679]
Kill anyone you do not recognize!

Id: [0x0005E67B]
Where is Cutter?! Find him! Find him now!

Id: [0x0005E67D]
To allow a breach of this magnitude! I should kill you all!

Id: [0x0005E67F]
He's here! Stop the interloper!

Id: [0x0005E681]
Kill the intruders! All of them!

Id: [0x0005E683]
He's the one responsible! Kill him!

Id: [0x0005E685]
Take position, men!

Id: [0x0005E686]
Ready your weapons!

Id: [0x0005E687]
Take aim!

Id: [0x0005E688]
Fire!

Id: [0x0005E689]
Reload! Reload!

Id: [0x0005E68A]
Again!

Id: [0x0005E69B]
Oi fellas - apologies for me tardiness. Cutter 'ad me workin' late.

Id: [0x0005E69C]
You know Cutter?

Id: [0x0005E69D]
[laugh]Who do ya think got me this post? We're like brothers, me an 'im.

Id: [0x0005E69F]
Now - what's it Silas wants us doin'. We 'ere to rough up the prisoners? Relieve 'em of their finery? I hear some of 'em carry real silver. Wouldn't mind helpin meself to a bit of it 'fore we send 'em on their way.

Id: [0x0005E6A0]
No. Keep clear of the merchandise. Don't speak of it either. We watch the gates and patrol the grounds.

Id: [0x0005E6A1]
Understood, boss. I am yours to command...

Id: [0x0005E6F7]
Perhaps I should send someone to retrieve him before he damages his reputation beyond repair...

Id: [0x0005E6F8]
They stumbled off to the northeast - no doubt in search of a tavern or some other place of ill repute.

Id: [0x0005E6F9]
Where were they taking him?

Id: [0x0005E6FA]
Towards the hilltop. Perhaps there's a doctor at the fort.

Id: [0x0005E6FF]
Actions speak louder than words, my friend. Arrest one and put him in stocks. See if he's so glib then.

Id: [0x0005E700]
To do so without cause will set them singing songs about us. Last thing the city needs is town criers complaining about our abuse of authority.

Id: [0x0005E701]
Then forget it. The crime is done, the killers gone, and those who know won't share their secrets. If the city wishes to harbor scoundrels - let them pay the price for it.

Id: [0x0005E702]
I need you to focus.

Id: [0x0005E703]
Easy for you to say! You didn't just watch your friend die!

Id: [0x0005E704]
The area's definitely suffered a decline in character.

Id: [0x0005E705]
Indeed. All manner of errifs and natty lads now walk the streets. Why just earlier today I had a run in with some!

Id: [0x0005E707]
Should we write his family, do you think?

Id: [0x0005E708]
Not our business to meddle - even if we've the best of intentions.

Id: [0x0005E709]
Which reminds me, we'd best not buy any meat tomorrow.

Id: [0x0005E70A]
[a breath]Good call, that.

Id: [0x0005E71F]
There are still hostile ships about. Best deal with them first.

Id: [0x0005E721]
Sink the schooners before boarding, Connor!

Id: [0x0005E723]
Aye aye, sir. Sounds a trifle dangerous but I'm sure you're up to it. I doubt they let convicted pirates like ol' Lucky Lem out of his cell much, so if his little scroll is anywhere- it's there.

Id: [0x0005E72B]
Ship graveyard's just around the point. Can't miss it. The men say Abel Owens was aboard one of the doomed vessels. If it's true, you'll find what's left of him here.

Id: [0x0005E72D]
Scavengers love the graveyard. So be on your guard!

Id: [0x0005E730]
If Able Owens' ship wrecked around here, they must have been looking for something themselves.

Id: [0x0005E733]
Another ship. Scavengers.

Id: [0x0005E736]
Put that down.

Id: [0x0005E737]
Piss off! I found it! 'Tis mine!

Id: [0x0005E73B]
Ha ha! What's mine is mine! Rantipole!

Id: [0x0005E73D]
You'll have to catch me if you want this box!

Id: [0x0005E73F]
Sorry mate! Looks like you lost this treasure hunt!

Id: [0x0005E742]
Nice try!

Id: [0x0005E744]
Not that easy.

Id: [0x0005E747]
[√ìtkon.]Damn.

Id: [0x0005E74C]
Fellas! Some hector in a hood's chasin' me!

Id: [0x0005E74D]
We'll deal with 'im.

Id: [0x0005E756]
The Octavius. Hendrick van der Heul's first and last captaincy.

Id: [0x0005E759]
Faulkner's guess better be right. Why anyone would believe the Northwest Passage exists is beyond me.

Id: [0x0005E75B]
Frozen in the arctic for 15 years. Safe to say there will be no survivors.

Id: [0x0005E75E]
Hendrick van der Heul. Captain Kidd's quarter master turned captain himself. The path you sought never existed Hendrick. I hope your suffering was short.

Id: [0x00062BB8]
A traitor named Benjamin Church, recently released from prison, has vanished as well. The two events are surely related.

Id: [0x00062BB9]
I will find Church for you.

Id: [0x00062BDB]
What was his crime?

Id: [0x00062BDC]
He was caught sending letters to the Loyalists detailing our troop strength. He claimed it was a scare tactic, that we might avoid war.

Id: [0x00062C87]
Ah, there you are! I've something to show you. Come, take a look.

Id: [0x00062C89]
What is it?

Id: [0x00062C8A]
A ledger. It lets us manage the homestead's dealings.

Id: [0x00062C8E]
And these?

Id: [0x00062C8F]
Ah, that was years ago. Before the slow fever. Before the Templars. Before everything collapsed...

Id: [0x00062CBF]
Earlier you said something about a slow fever and Templars?

Id: [0x00062CC0]
Oh... You don't want me to bore you with such tales.

Id: [0x00062CC1]
But I do...

Id: [0x00062CC2]
I had a wife once. Did you know that? Abigail... A woman of rare beauty and grace. Why she chose me, when she could have had anyone, who can say... But she did. [a beat]And then she bore me a son. You share his name. They were everything to me.

Id: [0x00062CC6]
You cannot blame yourself Achilles.

Id: [0x00062CC7]
Oh but I can. And I do. And I will.

Id: [0x00062CCE]
But that's all in the past. Better we focus on what's in front of us. Take up the ledger and I'll teach you how it all works.

Id: [0x00062E37]
I need to get out of this thing!

Id: [0x00062E39]
I will freeze before I drown!

Id: [0x00062E3B]
She is sinking very quickly!

Id: [0x00062E3D]
I must get out.

Id: [0x00062E3F]
There is not much time.

Id: [0x00062E42]
Whoa!

Id: [0x00062E44]
That was close!

Id: [0x00062E46]
Almost a sudden end to things!

Id: [0x00062ECD]
Excellent! Shall we be off?

Id: [0x00062ED1]
Do you even know where Benjamin Church has gone?

Id: [0x00062ED2]
[Sigh]I‚Äôm afraid not. I'd hoped to ambush him when he or one of his men returned here. It seems I‚Äôm too late. They've come and cleared the place out.

Id: [0x00062ED4]
I may be able to track him.

Id: [0x00062EDD]
Joseph Palmer retired to Jamaica- somewhere around this castle. Faulkner said the scroll would likely have ended up Lord Lewis Hutchinson's private museum.

Id: [0x00062EE0]
This place has seen much evil.

Id: [0x00062EE2]
I do not understand how anyone could live here. Small wonder Hutchinson went mad- this place feels mad.

Id: [0x00062EE6]
The cargo was heavy. It was likely loaded onto a wagon for transport...

Id: [0x00062EE8]
There were rations inside the crates. Medical supplies and clothing as well.

Id: [0x00062EED]
There was a wagon here... slowly weighed down as they loaded the supplies.

Id: [0x00062EEF]
Snow has obscured the tracks, but enough remains that we can still follow.

Id: [0x00062F19]
Just my luck... Going to freeze to death if I don't get this fixed...

Id: [0x00062F1B]
Are you Ben Church's man?

Id: [0x00062F1D]
Well played.

Id: [0x00062F1F]
Wait for me!

Id: [0x00062F25]
It was not wise to run.

Id: [0x00062F26]
W-what do you want?

Id: [0x00062F27]
Where is Benjamin Church?

Id: [0x00062F28]
I don't know! We was riding for a camp just north of here. It's where we normally unload the cargo. Maybe you'll find him th-

Id: [0x00062F2C]
Enough of that.

Id: [0x00062F2F]
You did not have to kill him.

Id: [0x00062F30]
Let's not waste time with all this pointless banter. Go catch up with the rest of Church's men. Infiltrate that camp of theirs and see what you can discover.

Id: [0x00062F33]
What about you?

Id: [0x00062F44]
Was a good haul today. Saw a bit of gunpowder in those crates. We'll get extra for that.

Id: [0x00062F45]
Aye. Church'll be pleased and we'll be rich.

Id: [0x00062F47]
I almost feel bad for the Yanks - shiverin' and starvin' out there. It's a hard way to go.

Id: [0x00062F49]
Manifest?

Id: [0x00062F4B]
Alright. Looks to be in order.

Id: [0x00062F4D]
Go and see the foreman. There's another run planned for tonight.

Id: [0x00062F4F]
Oi! Where's the foreman?

Id: [0x00062F50]
Center of camp - near the tree. Can't miss him.

Id: [0x00062F51]
Thank you kindly.

Id: [0x00062F52]
Won't be thankin' me when you hear what he's got planned...

Id: [0x00062F53]
About time you showed up! Listen here. Boss wants us to try something new tonight. A raid. No more convoys. We're to steal from the Yank camp itself.

Id: [0x00062F58]
Valley Forge?

Id: [0x00062F59]
That's right.

Id: [0x00062F5A]
You sure about this?

Id: [0x00062F5B]
It's not my business to be sure or not sure. I just do as Church asks. If you're so concerned, take it up with him.

Id: [0x00062F5C]
Is he here?

Id: [0x00062F5D]
Course not. Hiding in New York the last I heard, trying to keep a low profile - what on account of him not wanting to go back to jail and all.

Id: [0x00062F5F]
Alright. I'm in.

Id: [0x00062F60]
Course you are.

Id: [0x00062F62]
Look what we found!

Id: [0x00062F63]
He was creepin' round the camp all suspicious-like.

Id: [0x00062F64]
Must be a Yank spy!

Id: [0x00062F66]
No. He's something else. Something special. Isn't that right, Haytham?

Id: [0x00062F68]
Church told me ALL about you.

Id: [0x00062F69]
Then you should know better than this.

Id: [0x00062F6F]
Once you've dealt with these louts, meet me in New York.

Id: [0x00062F70]
What? You mean to just leave? Now?

Id: [0x00062F71]
If you can't handle a couple of mercenaries, then we've really no business working together.

Id: [0x00062F73]
I see you made it here in one piece.

Id: [0x00062F7B]
Very well. I will wait here then.

Id: [0x00062F7C]
Of course you will.

Id: [0x00062F7D]
Oh I'm sorry. Would you like me to come along and hold your hand, perhaps? Provide kind words of encouragement?

Id: [0x00062F8A]
That should suffice. Follow me.

Id: [0x00062F9C]
Where is Church?

Id: [0x00062F9D]
I'll tell you. Anything you want. Only promise that you'll let me live.

Id: [0x00062F9F]
You have my word.

Id: [0x00062FA0]
He left yesterday for Martinique. Took passage on a trading sloop called the Welcome. Loaded half its hold with the supplies he stole from the Patriots. That's all I know. I swear.

Id: [0x00062FA2]
You promised...

Id: [0x00062FA3]
And HE kept his word.

Id: [0x00062FA5]
Let's go.

Id: [0x00062FF0]
Welcome back. And how was Martinique?

Id: [0x00062FF3]
It was wrong of me to say the things I did...

Id: [0x00062FF5]
But now their hold is weakened, which makes me believe there's a chance for peace. Imagine what might be accomplished if we were to unite.

Id: [0x0006300C]
We need to know what the Loyalists are planning if we're to put an end to this.

Id: [0x0006300D]
I've tried! But the soldiers themselves are told nothing now - only to await orders from above.

Id: [0x0006300E]
Then keep digging. Come find me when you have something worth sharing.

Id: [0x00063010]
We're so close to victory. A few more well-placed attacks and we'll be able to put an end to this civil war and be rid of the Crown.

Id: [0x00063011]
What do you intend?

Id: [0x00063012]
Well nothing at the moment - since we're completely in the dark.

Id: [0x00063013]
I thought the Templars had eyes and ears everywhere.

Id: [0x00063014]
Oh, we did. Until you started cutting them off.

Id: [0x00063015]
Your contact said orders from above. It tells us exactly what we need to do: track down the Loyalist commanders.

Id: [0x00063087]
Hutchinson's personal museum. Kidd's scroll must be here somewhere.

Id: [0x000630C9]
I'm not leaving!

Id: [0x000630CA]
I'm coming up!

Id: [0x0006311D]
You lost?

Id: [0x0006311F]
I need the items on this list.

Id: [0x00063136]
The mechanism of the mask is broken.

Id: [0x0006313A]
I thought the same thing but considering what the man went through to hide it, I'm not so sure.

Id: [0x0006314E]
There must be some clues around that can help me with this.

Id: [0x00063155]
"Close to a tree kissed by fire."

Id: [0x00063156]
Remember what was written: Close to a tree kissed by fire, near the wolves abode, under the eagle's bed and the rock that does not fit- whatever that means. Do you think they might be landmarks?

Id: [0x0006316B]
Good. There is a temple on the island. What I seek is likely in there.

Id: [0x0006316C]
Happy hunting, captain.

Id: [0x00063174]
No chance of staying dry today.

Id: [0x00063178]
There must be an easier way.

Id: [0x0006317B]
No small wonder this temple has not collapsed yet.

Id: [0x0006317E]
Is there a pit after every door in this temple? Who built this place?

Id: [0x00063182]
I trust nature's access over this man-made death trap.

Id: [0x00063184]
These should hold.

The more I find out about him, the more mad Kidd becomes. Who sails all this way to hide a bloomin' sword? And I'll tell you another thing, this island gives me the shivers. Something creepy 'bout the place. It's clear we're the first people to set foot here in a good long while. What does that tell you, Connor? Nobody wants to. And why might that be? Because it's cursed is why. Anyway, I'm sure you'll be fine.

Id: [0x0006319E]
Help! Help!

Id: [0x00063239]
Have you considered the proposal?

Id: [0x0006323D]
Yet if we do not join with them, they risk defeat. And then what?

Id: [0x0006323E]
Ambush!

Id: [0x00063256]
Help! I need help!

Id: [0x00063258]
Stop him!

Id: [0x0006325A]
To arms, men! To arms! Save me!

Id: [0x0006325E]
Keep him away from me!

Id: [0x00063260]
Come no closer!

Id: [0x00063268]
Move.

Id: [0x00063269]
Go to hell.

Id: [0x0006326A]
I said MOVE.

Id: [0x000632C8]
Who you callin' a knob-end?

Id: [0x000632C9]
You. Because you are one.

Id: [0x000632CA]
I met 'im once- the Cap'n. He was seven feet tall if he was an inch, I tell ya. Legs like tree trunks and a smithy's arms. Almost broke my hand shakin' it hello. I could feel it then- when I met him- no weapon made by man could harm 'im.

Id: [0x000632DD]
GO 'WAY!

Id: [0x000632EE]
Time passed quickly after that - my days a blur of study, training, and work. What little free time Achilles allowed me was spent learning about the Templars. About Charles Lee and my father. I longed to confront them - to put an end to their schemes - to ensure my people would remain untroubled and free. But I knew it was too soon. That to approach them now would see me killed. All my work would be for nothing... Patience. Restraint. These proved the most difficult subjects for me. But in time I mastered them as well. Days became months. Months became years. And as my skills and knowledge grew, so too did I...

Id: [0x000632FB]
Three weeks... and not even a goodbye before you left.

Id: [0x000632FD]
Sorry...

Id: [0x000632FE]
Well? What are you waiting for?

Id: [0x0006330B]
Have some faith in the boy! He's yet to disappoint!

Id: [0x0006330C]
Well the bar's not been set very high now, has it?

Id: [0x00063315]
Ship ho!

Id: [0x00063316]
Is it the Welcome?

Id: [0x00063317]
Aye! And she's dropped anchor.

Id: [0x00063318]
Bring us in for a closer look, son.

Id: [0x0006331B]
Enemy ahead!

Id: [0x0006331D]
They're making to flee!

Id: [0x0006331E]
After them!

Id: [0x00063338]
She's passing between the cliffs, boy, and the Aquila's too big to follow. We need to go around!

Id: [0x0006333A]
Goddammit! We're going to lose him!

Id: [0x0006333B]
What other choice have we?! Those rocks would crush us!

Id: [0x00063342]
There! There he is!

Id: [0x00063343]
Do not let him escape!

Id: [0x00063344]
You heard the man! Catch that bastard!

Id: [0x00063347]
Nowhere left for you to run, Benjamin...

Id: [0x0006334A]
Enemy ships approaching!

Id: [0x0006334C]
Ready our weapons! Prepare to return fire!

Id: [0x00063366]
Church is using the ambush as cover. Sink him before he escapes! Send that bastard to the sea floor!

Id: [0x00063367]
No. I need his ship afloat. The cargo must be saved.

Id: [0x0006336A]
Stop him, Connor!

Id: [0x0006336C]
Do not let Church escape!

Id: [0x0006336E]
Focus on our true target!

Id: [0x00063370]
You should have listened to me!

Id: [0x00063372]
He's nearly away!

Id: [0x00063378]
I got 'em! All of 'em! You get what I need and I'll give 'em to ya! Simple! You got a ship! Could find 'em all to boot!

Id: [0x00063379]
Who is that man?

Id: [0x0006337A]
Him? Some ol' salt always on about some letters he's got from Captain Kidd. Nonsense really but he doesn't hurt no one so I leave him be. Talk to him if you fancy- but be warned he'll chew your ear off. Anyway, the Aquila's here for you- if you should get a pang for the open sea we'll be waiting. Now, I implore you to head up the hill 'fore the Old Man comes out of retirement just for me.

Id: [0x000633A0]
Connor! Connor! Some lout's trying to break into our house! He's armed! I'm getting the boys.

Id: [0x000633A1]
[breath]Find them, I will handle it.

Id: [0x000633A4]
What in God's name is going on over there?

Id: [0x000633A7]
Stop!

Id: [0x000633AA]
Something's amiss!

Id: [0x000633AE]
Please, mister. Don' hurt me.

Id: [0x000633B0]
Beggin' yer mercy, sir. I din' mean it. Won' 'appen again, I swear.

Id: [0x000633B2]
I won' come back 'ere. I promise. Just leave me be, mister.

Id: [0x000633B9]
What's the trouble Connor? Saw you tear past chasing a man.

Id: [0x000633BA]
He was trying to rob your home. It has been dealt with.

Id: [0x000633BB]
What!? The women! Is everyone alright?!

Id: [0x000633C0]
You should have been there!

Id: [0x000633C1]
What?!

Id: [0x000633C2]
I TOLD you to head back. I didn't need you!

Id: [0x000633C3]
Since when is a skinny runt like you safe out in the bush alone?

Id: [0x000633C4]
If Diana's hurt, I swear you'll be the one payin' for it.

Id: [0x000633C6]
Come on you little lobcock!

Id: [0x000633C7]
I'm gonna smack you senseless.

Id: [0x000633C9]
[very angry]Big bloody good for nothing lummox!

Id: [0x000633CA]
If you don't shut your mouth I'll shut it for you.

Id: [0x000633CD]
We built this for anybody around to use. Should always be somebody up for a game if you want!

Id: [0x000633CF]
Got a moment, Connor?

Id: [0x000633D1]
What would you have me do?

Id: [0x000633D2]
Watch my back while I gather them. Meet me in Boston at my old shop.

Id: [0x000633D5]
Connor! Good to see you.

Id: [0x000633D7]
Finish what you're up to. I'll be here waiting.

Id: [0x000633D9]
I can see you're busy. Come back when you have time.

Id: [0x000633DC]
Been trying to avoid eye contact with my old neighbors, so far so good. Not so worried now you're here.

Id: [0x000633DD]
How are you doing otherwise?

Id: [0x000633DE]
Oh, alright I suppose. Things never really go as planned...but that's life.

Id: [0x000633DF]
Really, how do you mean?

Id: [0x000633E0]
You know, you make a plan and it all goes awry and nothing gets better, only slightly different.

Id: [0x000633E1]
Sounds like you have had a string of misfortune. It will pass.

Id: [0x000633E4]
What are you doing here?

Id: [0x000633E5]
Sweeping my steps if it please you.

Id: [0x000633E6]
Since when are these your steps?

Id: [0x000633E7]
Since I bought them three weeks ago.

Id: [0x000633E8]
From who?

Id: [0x000633E9]
The owner. Via his apprentice. Owner shipped off outta town, what's it to you?

Id: [0x000633EA]
I AM THE OWNER!

Id: [0x000633EB]
Not anymore, mate. Sorry. Better sort things out with your apprentice. He's often at the pub over there but I'm sure you already knew that.

Id: [0x000633EC]
Patrick!

Id: [0x000633EF]
Lance.

Id: [0x000633F0]
Patrick! What gave you the right to sell my shop?!

Id: [0x000633F1]
Well you were run outta town. I thought you'd never come back so I sold it all- the shop, the tools. It's rough luck. Anyway, it's been great chatting but I must be off. Have a nice life.

Id: [0x000633F3]
What rot. Tools are a woodworker's lifeblood, he'd never sell them. I bet he's got them stashed somewhere.

Id: [0x000633F4]
Then we follow him.

Id: [0x000633F7]
I'll load these in the cart come night fall and be in New York free of this rubbish for good before the month is out.

Id: [0x000633F9]
Lance. Idiot. He thinks he's angry now, wait 'til I sign for his plans from France.

Id: [0x000633FD]
[laughing]Well that's something, at least. Thank you. [shifting tone]I still can't believe he sold my shop. I'll see you back at the homestead.

Id: [0x00063404]
Hey Connor.

Id: [0x00063406]
A word, Connor?

Id: [0x00063407]
Do you have business in New York on occasion? I only ask because I ordered a package from France and it's long overdue. I've written the post master and he's yet to respond. I thought you could inquire in person if you had the chance.

Id: [0x00063408]
I will pass by the next time I am there.

Id: [0x0006340B]
I've come to inquire on a package arriving from France on behalf of Lance O'Donnell.

Id: [0x0006340C]
Was picked up and signed for by his apprentice a couple days back. Patrick O'Hara.

Id: [0x0006340D]
Patrick O'Hara is Mister O'Donnell's former apprentice. Would you happen to know here he is?

Id: [0x0006340E]
Sure- he's been hanging around the docks the last few days. Should be round the way.

Id: [0x00063411]
Here! Take these pages and hide them! Don't let that guy get his hands on 'em!

Id: [0x00063415]
I'll flatten you.

Id: [0x00063417]
Come on you weasel-faced nitwit!

Id: [0x00063419]
You need some sense knocked into you!

Id: [0x0006341B]
Come on, scapegrace!

Id: [0x0006341D]
I'm going to beat you senseless.

Id: [0x0006341F]
You deserve a right beating!

Id: [0x00063421]
I'm going to smash you, ya looby!

Id: [0x00063423]
Bloody Godfrey.

Id: [0x00063425]
[laugh]Time I set you straight!

Id: [0x00063427]
Arg!

Id: [0x0006342A]
You got what was comin' to you!

Id: [0x0006342C]
Only way to shut you up.

Id: [0x00063431]
I will find her.

Id: [0x00063432]
The dog might help track her down, he has a good nose.

Id: [0x00063435]
Come on, boy.

Id: [0x00063437]
She has been gathering Evening Primrose almost every night.

Id: [0x00063439]
She is obsessed with the oil it yields.

Id: [0x0006343B]
That is all going to stop now. I don't understand why she wants so damned much of the stuff!

Id: [0x0006343E]
She picked some here.

Id: [0x00063445]
Connor! Anything yet?!

Id: [0x00063447]
Prudence!

Id: [0x00063449]
Prudence! Where are you?!

Id: [0x0006344D]
Oooh, Good boy.

Id: [0x0006344F]
Do you smell something?

Id: [0x00063451]
Good dog, lead me to her.

Id: [0x00063454]
Help! Please! Somebody help me!

Id: [0x00063456]
Anyone! Help!

Id: [0x00063458]
Connor! Oh thank God! Please help me!

Id: [0x0006345B]
Help me Connor!

Id: [0x0006345F]
Thank you so much, Connor. Thank you. I don't want to think of what might have happened if you'd not arrived. I saw some primrose growing there and the bear just came charging at me.

Id: [0x00063477]
Why are you gathering primrose?

Id: [0x00063478]
Well. Warren and I have been trying to conceive a child for a- long time now. I read that evening primrose encourages...fertility. [beat]I'm sorry, this is not a proper conversation given the circumstance.

Id: [0x00063479]
I understand. Not another word on the matter.

Id: [0x0006347C]
Prudence!

Id: [0x0006347D]
Are you alright, my love?!

Id: [0x0006347E]
I'll be fine, thanks to Connor.

Id: [0x0006347F]
Thank you. Connor. Once again.

Id: [0x00063496]
Come back later.

Id: [0x00063498]
You look busy. If it's important, see me when you have the time.

Id: [0x0006349A]
Murderer!

Id: [0x0006349C]
Go to hell you monster!

Id: [0x0006349E]
You make me sick!

Id: [0x000634A0]
Doctor Death! You earned that name! Bastard!

Id: [0x000634A2]
Fight back! You devil spawn!

Id: [0x000634A4]
Leave me be! 'tis all lies!

Id: [0x000634A6]
You believe everything you read in the broadsheets?!

Id: [0x000634A8]
I did nothing wrong! It's the Redcoats! Open your eyes!

Id: [0x000634AA]
Piss off!

Id: [0x000634AC]
None of it's true!

Id: [0x00063522]
Can this ship go no faster?!

Id: [0x00063524]
Speed, Connor! We need more speed!

Id: [0x00063526]
It's almost as though you WANT him to escape...

Id: [0x00063528]
Hurry son! We won't get a second chance at this!

Id: [0x0006352A]
Perhaps someone with more experience should take the wheel?

Id: [0x0006352C]
How is it you came to captain a ship, given the way you sail?

Id: [0x0006354A]
Could you make a little more noise?

Id: [0x0006354E]
Snow doesn't make it any easier to spot, so I have to rely on tracking it.

Id: [0x00063550]
I need to get to him before the snow falls, or he'll be impossible to spot.

Id: [0x00063551]
I have never seen a cougar like that. I would like to help you.

Id: [0x00063552]
I'll follow you then. Stay quiet.

Id: [0x00063556]
Look at the size of those claw-marks! Better shoot true!

Id: [0x00063558]
He has a taste for fresh meat- seen this before. Looks fresh. He's close.

Id: [0x0006355B]
There he goes! We won't get another chance at this!

Id: [0x0006355E]
Come on Connor! We won't see him again after this!

Id: [0x00063560]
This is our only shot. Hurry up!

Id: [0x00063566]
You must be here for my new friend! I was dumping a load and he went straight in. Lucky I wasn't in there...

Id: [0x00063567]
Very. What are you thinking, Myriam?

Id: [0x00063568]
Flush and fire. Norris can back off, one of us goes in there to draw him out and the other waits out here to shoot.

Id: [0x00063569]
I will go in.

Id: [0x00063570]
Thank you, Myriam.

Id: [0x00063572]
She will like it.

Id: [0x00063574]
It is perfect. No reason to be nervous.

Id: [0x00063576]
Vas-y Maurice, c'est rien (Come on, Maurice. It is nothing.)

Id: [0x00063579]
Norris! What are you doing out here?

Id: [0x0006357A]
I want to give Myriam her knife. Maybe you come with me?

Id: [0x0006357B]
Of course. What is keeping you?

Id: [0x0006357C]
What am I doing?! Giving a woman a KNIFE as a gift!? It's so stupid!

Id: [0x0006357D]
This is something she will appreciate and use.

Id: [0x00063580]
Two hunters are better than one. I can help if you like.

Id: [0x00063581]
Would you? I'd be much obliged.

Id: [0x00063584]
Meet me at my Northern most hunting blind after you take your first skin.

Id: [0x0006358F]
Connor!

Id: [0x00063595]
The current here is swift. We still have a chance.

Id: [0x00063597]
Chain shot, Connor! Or have you decided that you DO want to destroy Church's ship?

Id: [0x00063599]
I won't complain if you elect to sink his ship, son. It's just - I thought you wanted it in one piece?

Id: [0x0006359B]
Careful boy! Switch to chain shot or she'll be sunk.

Id: [0x0006359D]
Easy now or there won't be a ship to board. Chain shot should do the trick.

Id: [0x0006359F]
You should consider ceasing fire - or at least switching to chain shot.

Id: [0x000635A1]
Easy now! You don't want to put too many holes in her.

Id: [0x000635A7]
You confuse me, son. First you insist we spare his ship, but now you seek to blow it up?

Id: [0x00063654]
Could use a little help here!

Id: [0x00063656]
Connor? Need some back-up!

Id: [0x00063658]
Connor? You out there?

Id: [0x0006365A]
Bloody hell. Not him.

Id: [0x0006365C]
Please don't kill me! I'll never come back!

Id: [0x0006365E]
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

Id: [0x00063660]
I won't come back again! I swear it!

Id: [0x00063662]
The time for forgiveness has passed.

Id: [0x00063664]
Please, mister. Please. Wasn't right for me to come back. I see that now. Just let me go and I'll stay away for good.

Id: [0x00063667]
If I hadn't had this blade, that lickspittle might've gutted me.

Id: [0x000636A3]
Oh. Connor. Do you have a moment?

Id: [0x000636A5]
Could I trouble you for a moment, Connor?

Id: [0x000636A7]
Don't even know where to start...

Id: [0x000636A9]
Ah Myriam. Probably already married.

Id: [0x000636AB]
Connor!

Id: [0x000636AD]
Allo.

Id: [0x000636B2]
She hated them.

Id: [0x000636B4]
Not the right gift.

Id: [0x0006382C]
Connor.

Id: [0x0006382F]
I need a few more blasts! Be careful!

Id: [0x00063831]
This is my last one! Just a little longer.

Id: [0x00063833]
Somebody's in our mine!

Id: [0x00063835]
They're haulin' out our property! Stop them!

Id: [0x00063837]
After 'em, boys!

Id: [0x0006383B]
Oh!  That was a little more than I expected! I will see you at home, Connor. I need to speak with Big Dave about making this right away.

Id: [0x0006383E]
This will never end. There must be another way.

Id: [0x00063842]
You will not distribute these pamphlets any longer. Understood?

Id: [0x00063843]
I won't hand 'em out no-more. I was just doing it for the coin, anyway. Got nothing against Dr. White. It's the British who 'ave it out for him.

Id: [0x0006384A]
Maybe not, but I have seen you care for people before, you have the way of it.

Id: [0x0006384C]
Diana! Perfect. I'm told you have a healer's hand. Please see to this young man. Connor, if could help the two gentleman out front?

Id: [0x0006384F]
Thanks, skip. Good of you to help. I should be alright.

Id: [0x00063850]
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the shoulder. Bad luck. [chuckles]Thank you captain

Id: [0x00063853]
They are tended to.

Id: [0x00063854]
Good. But we aren't finished yet. Some other chaps round the side.

Id: [0x00063857]
Many thanks, cap'n.

Id: [0x00063858]
That's a spot better, sir. Thanks.

Id: [0x00063859]
Caught some burn off a rope. It happens. Thanks skipper.

Id: [0x0006385B]
Well thank you doctor. I haven't studied the practice or anything.

Id: [0x0006385C]
Maybe not, but your instincts are superb and you have a healer's touch. If you had the time, I would be grateful for your help on a more regular basis.

Id: [0x00063863]
Nice handle that is. Best a smithy could ask for.

Id: [0x00063865]
Any smith would be glad to have that.

Id: [0x00063868]
What is happening?

Id: [0x00063869]
Connor!

Id: [0x0006386A]
Found this guy skulking around the Inn. I pressed him and it turns out he's looking for a deserter goes by the name of Big Dave. Says he's alone. Isn't that right?

Id: [0x0006386B]
I am! I'm alone. I swear it.

Id: [0x0006386D]
Bloody hell.

Id: [0x0006386F]
Another one Connor! If he gets a back to his officers I'm done for!

Id: [0x00063873]
Hey!

Id: [0x00063876]
Where is he?

Id: [0x00063877]
Coward kicked me in the gingamabobs then threw sand in Dave's eyes. But he's long gone now.

Id: [0x00063878]
Not good, Connor.

Id: [0x00063879]
No. We can expect visitors soon.

Id: [0x0006387A]
They'll have to get through us first.

Id: [0x0006387C]
We're with ya, big guy. No matter who's coming.

Id: [0x0006387F]
Connor glad, you're here. I want to show you something.

Id: [0x00063884]
I can hear them coming.

Id: [0x00063887]
There's more coming! I'm sure of it! Get ready!

Id: [0x0006388A]
Have you seen the woman that worked here?! She was my wife. A trollop! But my wife!

Id: [0x0006388C]
A woman and her little girl. Have you seen them?

Id: [0x0006388F]
Oh no. Not you.

Id: [0x00063894]
Connor!

Id: [0x00063896]
We need you.

Id: [0x00063899]
Get out here! I've had enough of this!

Id: [0x0006389B]
The longer I wait, the worse it gets! Get out here you hedge-whore!

Id: [0x0006389D]
Yeah. Get out here!

Id: [0x0006389F]
I am sick of waiting.

Id: [0x000638A1]
Come out and get what is comin' to ya.

Id: [0x000638A4]
What is it, Prudence?

Id: [0x000638A5]
I feel silly bothering you with this but Warren's taken our yield to market in Boston. Could you round up the livestock for me? I've tried but this baby in my belly takes the wind out of me.

Id: [0x000638A6]
Of course. I will see to it.

Id: [0x000638A9]
Faster than they look.

Id: [0x000638AB]
[grunt]The things I do for this place.

Id: [0x000638AD]
Come on! Get in the pen!

Id: [0x000638AF]
Thank you Connor. I could never have managed that.

Id: [0x000638B0]
It was my pleasure. Are you well?

Id: [0x000638B1]
I am. And I couldn't be happier. Warren and I have been waiting a long time for this. And if truth be told, we could not dream of a better place to raise our family.

Id: [0x000638C5]
You seem to think I favor him. But my enemy is a notion, not a nation. It is wrong to compel obedience - whether to the British Crown or the Templar Cross. And I hope in time the Loyalists will see this too, for they are also victims.

Id: [0x000638C6]
You oppose tyranny. Injustice. These are just symptoms. Their true cause is human weakness. Why do you think I keep on trying to show you the error of your way?

Id: [0x000638C7]
[Teka‚Äôniohsk√®n:‚Äôen k√≠:ken!]It is a mistake!

Id: [0x000638C8]

[Sator√≠shen!]Stop!

[Enkator√≠shen n√≥:nen ensenh√©:ion]I will. When you are dead.

[√ç:wehre iah now√©n:ton thaionkwaia‚Äôtanonhst√°:tonke. √ì:nen wahsator√≠shen, iontiat√©n:ro.]It seems our people will never be safe. You are resting now, my friend.

Id: [0x000638DD]
We must hold this position for as long as it takes! If the enemy is allowed to push through, we will lose what precious little ground we've gained. The sacrifices your brothers have made today must not have been in vain! Now go! Bring the fight to our enemy! Make them rue the day they marched upon us!

Id: [0x000638E3]
Where is Charles Lee?

Id: [0x000638E4]
That batard (bastard). He shows up in the middle of our preparations and just takes charge. Screams at everyone to advance and then rides away. I am left to pick up the pieces.

Id: [0x000638F0]
We are low on ammunition, sir - and the enemy advances.

Id: [0x000638F1]
Then we need to pull back, rejoin the others, and cover their escape.

Id: [0x0006390B]
Connor, my friend! You have arrived just in time to bear witness to our glorious victory!

Id: [0x00063910]
Where did THEY come from?

Id: [0x00063913]
Send word that we are falling back. Everyone to me! Now! Now!

Id: [0x00063917]
I will hold the area while you bring them to safety.

Id: [0x00063919]
I grant you my finest soldiers to serve as your personal guard. There is nothing they will not do to ensure you are victorious.

Id: [0x0006391A]
Bonne chance mon ami. (Good luck my friend.)

Id: [0x0006392C]
Well done, my friend! You have saved many lives today.

Id: [0x0006392D]
Connor's tale rings true. Lee was acting most odd upon the battlefield.

Id: [0x0006392E]
I will investigate these allegations at once.

Id: [0x0006407B]
We are closer than you think, father.

Id: [0x0006409D]
I need to get below deck. Who knows what madness my father intends...

Id: [0x000640EE]
You must be Connor! We've been raring to finally meet you! My names's Catherine and this is Diana. We're the wives of those two blockheads who cut trees.

Id: [0x000640EF]
Nice to meet you. We've heard so much of you from the boys. Glad to finally put a face to the name.

Id: [0x000640F0]
The pleasure is mine.

Id: [0x000640F1]
We were just discussing how nice this bit of territory is, on a river with nobody upstream. I won't lie, Godfrey's letter had me a little worried but now that we're here and settled, I must say I'm rather happy.

Id: [0x000640F2]
They had us on this plot north of Champlain that was a tangle of rock and bramble. Horrible place. It's a real treat to be able to walk up the hill and take in the ocean.

Id: [0x000640F3]
Your husbands must keep you busy.

Id: [0x000640F4]
Ha! Nothing we can't handle, Connor. The boys think they run the show but the real bosses are right in front you of you.

Id: [0x000640F5]
I do not doubt it.

Id: [0x000640FC]
I told you I had the days work. I told you to head back the mill and clean the saws so they were ready for rippin'. If you had listened, you would have been there and none of this would have happened.

Id: [0x000640FD]
What are you talking about?!

Id: [0x00064100]
Connor! Great timing. I was just getting underway on something that might be of interest to you.

Id: [0x00064101]
What is that?

Id: [0x00064102]
Those plans you retrieved for me. And believe you me, they were worth all the fuss. [looks around]A FOLDING chair.

Id: [0x00064103]
I do not follow you.

Id: [0x00064104]
It's a chair. That FOLDS, Connor. You can fold them right up and stack them. Store them. Transport them. I could have a thousand chairs in my back room! It's simple brilliance and I am going to make a fortune.

Id: [0x00064105]
A folding chair. Well I wish you the best with it.

Id: [0x00064106]
You'll see, Connor. You'll see.

Id: [0x00064121]
Good day, Connor.

Id: [0x00064122]
Hello, Doctor White. Diana.

Id: [0x00064123]
Hello there, Connor.

Id: [0x00064124]
Diana and I were just having a look over our equipment and facilities, they've seen a great deal of use in the last few days.

Id: [0x00064125]
So things have turned for the better?

Id: [0x00064126]
Better than it ever was in Boston. I was missing my apprentice when things first exploded but now I have Diana. She is better than he was in every respect.

Id: [0x00064127]
And are you happy, Diana?

Id: [0x00064128]
I never thought this would be my path but now that I'm here, I admit it feels right.

Id: [0x00064141]
[effort of punching]You're not really in a position to be makin' threats are ya?

Id: [0x00064142]
Not yet.

Id: [0x00064143]
Unbelievable...

Id: [0x0006419A]
All they need do is raise the white flag.

Id: [0x0006419B]
They shoulda done that a long time ago. All this fighting? Serves no purpose. The Crown's sure to win in the end. To waste all these lives chasing a fool notion... Breaks my heart, it does.

Id: [0x0006419C]
I'll go bring the wagon and meet up with you later.

Id: [0x00064247]
Smoke Connor?

Id: [0x00064248]
No thank you.

Id: [0x00064249]
We were just recalling the eventful day of little Hunter's birth.

Id: [0x0006424A]
I am not sure I have ever been so anxious.

Id: [0x0006424B]
Ha!

Id: [0x0006424C]
I barely remember a thing up until the moment I heard him cry. Then it all slows down and I recall every little detail. From Hunter's wailing face, to Prudence's teary eyes filled with pure love, to the smell of the mud and the leaves. [beat]I've never been as happy as I was in that instant.

Id: [0x0006424E]
Things in this house sound- right.

Id: [0x00064258]
...delicious, love. [notices Connor]Connor! What brings you?

Id: [0x00064259]
I was passing by and I thought I would stop in an see how you were fairing.

Id: [0x0006425A]
That's nice of you. Well, my boy, we are fairing very well.

Id: [0x0006425B]
Between those who live here, the sailors coming and going from the pier, not to mention the travelers, our beds are always full and our taps are always flowing.

Id: [0x0006425C]
I am pleased things have worked out for you here.

Id: [0x0006425D]
As are we, Connor. I'd be lying if I told you we weren't worried when we were ousted from our old place, but the Lord works in mysterious ways.

Id: [0x0006426B]
Hello, Connor.

Id: [0x0006426C]
Hello.

Id: [0x0006426D]
Is something the matter?

Id: [0x0006426E]
No, nothing that need worry you.

Id: [0x0006426F]
I would not pry, but please know that if there was anything I could do to help, I would.

Id: [0x00064270]
It's alright. Connor already knows half of it. As you know, we have been trying to have a child, Connor. For a long time. Thus far we've not been blessed, even once. It takes its toll after a time.

Id: [0x00064284]
Get back here, traitors!

Id: [0x00064286]
Oh how I'll enjoy making you pay for your betrayal!

Id: [0x0006428A]
I thought you had this all sewn up! So why do you run from us? Hmmm.

Id: [0x0006428E]
Did Church pay you well? Were you rewarded handsomely? And what good does your gold do you now?

Id: [0x00064290]
Is it magic gold, you think? Like the one they spun the fleece from? Do you think it will shield you from the flames?

Id: [0x00064291]
You should see their faces son! The fear. The panic. Why - I think this one wet himself.

Id: [0x00064292]
I grow impatient, Connor. You really must catch up or I'll be forced to kill them myself! Besides, I don't think the building is long for this world...

Id: [0x00064294]
Now is not the time for sight-seeing!

Id: [0x00064298]
Stuck! See if you can find something to pry it open.

Id: [0x0006429A]
Connor?

Id: [0x0006429C]
What are you up to?

Id: [0x0006429E]
Oh. No. Don't do that. There's no way of knowing what's on the other siiiii-

Id: [0x000642A1]
-iiiiiiide.

Id: [0x000642A2]
We do now.

Id: [0x00064485]
Could we hurry up? I need to get back to work.

Id: [0x00064487]
Hey, a little faster mon ami? (my friend?)

Id: [0x00064488]
Ha! That's a nice one!

Id: [0x0006448A]
Doesn't look safe in there. Be careful. I'll be at the mine. What you said about Myriam is interesting...

Id: [0x0006448B]
That was close.

Id: [0x0006448C]
It would have burned had it not been here.

Id: [0x0006448D]
Achilles will be pleased.

Id: [0x00064490]
Old man.

Id: [0x00064493]
A sad day.

Id: [0x00064495]
You can go home, if you want. I don't need you for this one.

Id: [0x00064497]
Oh come off it, Terry. I'm fine!

Id: [0x00064499]
Leave it alone, Godfrey!

Id: [0x0006449F]
Are you alright? There is no need for this.

Id: [0x000644A0]
Bah. He's a block-head.

Id: [0x000644A1]
He'll cool-off in a spell. Just needs some time is all.

Id: [0x000644A4]
Are you not angry, Godfrey?

Id: [0x000644A5]
Me? Not at all! Terry's just got himself a temper and I won't let him get away with it. It's really no trouble. He'll calm down. The runt couldn't do much damage anyway!

Id: [0x000644A6]
Does this happen often?

Id: [0x000644A7]
Ha! I was just telling Lance how I can set the calendar by these events. It's really not a worry, Connor, but I appreciate your concern.

Id: [0x000644A9]
Ah! What in God's name is going on around here?

Id: [0x000644AB]
Keep your distance, stranger, if you know what's good for you.

Id: [0x000644AD]
Get outa here, friend. Or something bad'll happen to you.

Id: [0x000644B0]
You asked for it.

Id: [0x000644B2]
You had your warning.

Id: [0x000644B6]
Anyone? Please?

Id: [0x000644B8]
Someone pull me up!

Id: [0x000644BA]
Finally got the money to spruce the place up a little.

Id: [0x000644BD]
Back-off. This is not your business.

Id: [0x000644BF]
Be gone with you, this doesn't concern you.

Id: [0x000644C0]
Father.

Id: [0x000644C2]
Connor. [a beat]Any last words?

Id: [0x000644C7]
Never you mind. Just do as I ask.

Id: [0x000644F7]
It's locked. Give me a moment.

Id: [0x0006452F]
Now!

Id: [0x00064530]
We need to get out of here.

Id: [0x00064531]
You don't say...

Id: [0x000645EB]
You asked for it.

Id: [0x000645ED]
You been warned.

Id: [0x000645EE]
[Sawenn√≠:io‚Äôs ki‚Äô n√†:‚Äôa, nek tsi iah n√©: tek√©n:ton tsi t√≥:kenske.]Your words may have been sincere, but that does not make them true.

Id: [0x000645F0]
Connor!

Id: [0x000645F2]
Thank God you are here.

Id: [0x000645F3]
She can't be far. We should split up to cover more ground.

Id: [0x000645F7]
Hip hip! This way!

Id: [0x000645F9]
Not there...

Id: [0x000645FB]
Saw the scabs from my hunting blind. Get to that and you shouldn't have any trouble finding them.

Id: [0x00064600]
These woods are teeming with deer. Easy pickings.

Id: [0x00064602]
Pile of pelts we got.[laugh]

Id: [0x00064604]
Longest I've gone up here without killing something.

Id: [0x00064606]
Got his trail yet?

Id: [0x00064608]
This cat's clever, Connor.

Id: [0x0006460A]
Anything?

Id: [0x00064631]
Nice shot.

Id: [0x00064648]
He didn't do anything!

Id: [0x0006464A]
Leave him be!

Id: [0x0006464C]
Stop it! Stop it!

Id: [0x0006464E]
Please, mister. Help him! He didn't do anything wrong. We were just talking! They don't like his accent is all!

Id: [0x00064651]
Hop it. This is not your concern.

Id: [0x00064653]
Shove-off, mate. Or you'll be sorry

Id: [0x00064655]
That's it, you'll get yours too.

Id: [0x00064657]
Fancy a beating, eh? We'll give ya what you want.

Id: [0x0006465C]
Alright. But please don't let her see you. She will think I'm bizarre.

Id: [0x0006465D]
Hiya, Connor.

Id: [0x00064661]
Norris. I looked around her camp and it seems she needs a new hunting knife. The one she is using has seen better days

Id: [0x00064662]
Ah oui? (Oh yeah?) That seems more right for her...I'll think on it. Merci! (Thanks!)

Id: [0x00064663]
[sigh]Really?

Id: [0x00064667]
Ah, you seem occup√© (busy). I meet you there when you have more time.

Id: [0x00064669]
You are busy. Come back when you have time.

Id: [0x0006466C]
You have some time before the next one!

Id: [0x0006466E]
Looks like you have a little time!

Id: [0x00064670]
I could not have done that without you, Connor, and now I have what I need to make the knife. Merci! (Thank you!)

Id: [0x00064673]
Connor! Thank the Lord!

Id: [0x00064675]
Connor, please!

Id: [0x00064676]
We must hurry!

Id: [0x00064678]
I must find the source.

Id: [0x0006467A]
Where is the man printing these pamphlets?

Id: [0x0006467C]
Dr. Death! Get the news on Dr. Death!

Id: [0x0006467E]
White Death! Come for healing, leave in a box!

Id: [0x00064680]
You've heard about him! Now read about him! The Doctor with a Grim touch!

Id: [0x00064682]
Inform you families of White Death!

Id: [0x00064684]
I'll take that if you're giving it.

Id: [0x00064686]
Thanks mister. It's less than I get for this, though.

Id: [0x00064688]
Thank you sir. [projected]Dr. Death! Get the news on Dr. Death!

Id: [0x0006468A]
It's not much but very kind of you.

Id: [0x0006468D]
Look mister, there's a man who pays me to hand these papers out. So long as he's dolling the coin I'll be doing what he asks.

Id: [0x0006468E]
You won't lose your leg, that much I can promise you. But it will hurt some for a time longer.

Id: [0x00064690]
Looks worse than it is. Just keep it clean and you should be fine.

Id: [0x00064697]
This should suffice.

Id: [0x00064698]
Thank you! You won't regret this Connor, we promise!

Id: [0x0006469A]
I'm sorry, Connor. But that's just not enough.

Id: [0x0006469C]
We'll need to wait a little longer. That much won't do it.

Id: [0x000646A0]
Bugger off unless you want to end up like him.

Id: [0x000646A2]
Get out of here, mate. This is not your business.

Id: [0x000646A4]
You had your warning. Get him!

Id: [0x000646A6]
Another tough guy, boys! Take him down.

Id: [0x000646AC]
How's it coming, Big Dave?

Id: [0x000646AE]
You make any progress on the knife? I would like to give it to Myriam soon.

Id: [0x000646B1]
Captain's on a warpath for that deserter.

Id: [0x000646B2]
What's his name? 'Big Man' or some-such-thing?

Id: [0x000646B3]
Big Dave. Did in a whole unit escaping, they say. Dave's in for a rough ride, seems to me.

Id: [0x000646B4]
I thought you should know I overheard some Regulars talking. They are looking for you.

Id: [0x000646B5]
I imagine they are. I'll have to face them a some time or another. [sighs]

Id: [0x000646B7]
I'll tell you where to go!

Id: [0x000646BA]
Left!

Id: [0x000646BC]
Go left!

Id: [0x000646BE]
Um! The other way! Right!

Id: [0x000646C0]
Not that way! Right!

Id: [0x000646C2]
They're straight ahead, I think!

Id: [0x000646C4]
We need to go straight!

Id: [0x000646C6]
There they are!

Id: [0x000646C8]
We need to hurry!

Id: [0x000646CA]
Quickly!

Id: [0x000646CC]
It's this way!

Id: [0x000646CE]
Bugger off before I crack you one.

Id: [0x000646D0]
Leave! This has nothing to do with you.

Id: [0x000646D2]
Alright. I'll tune you up, first!

Id: [0x000646D4]
I guess you want a beating.

Id: [0x000646D7]
Ahhhhh!

Id: [0x000646D9]
Get back!

Id: [0x000646DB]
I'll tear out your eyes if you come in here!

Id: [0x00064B73]
Bless you. This will build a fine place of worship. I am most grateful.

Id: [0x00064B75]
Patience is a virtue. Take your time to collect what we need.

Id: [0x00064B77]
Not quite enough but I have faith you'll gather what's needed.

Id: [0x00064B78]
Hello, Connor. Lovely day.

Id: [0x00064B7A]
Leave me be!

Id: [0x00064B8E]
...and my little brother Joseph tossed him in the river!

Id: [0x00064B8F]
Ha ha ha.

Id: [0x00064B90]
Ha ha ha.

Id: [0x00064B91]
Ha ha ha.

Id: [0x00064B92]
Connor! We were just recalling our weddings.

Id: [0x00064B93]
Spirited events, I take it.[laugh]

Id: [0x00064B94]
Spirited?[laugh]More like brawls than unions, they were! Ha ha.

Id: [0x00064B95]
Calling Jo 'little' is like calling me Big Terry- boy's a bloody mountain!

Id: [0x00064B96]
My younger brother had a blow-up with one of Terry's cousins. A minor disagreement about some lass's dance card. I'll just say Terry's cousin sobered up right quick when it was over!

Id: [0x00064B97]
Poor boy! Sittin' there sopping wet on a stump while Joseph spun 'round with the object of his affection.

Id: [0x00064BE2]
Hello, Connor. Enjoying yourself?

Id: [0x00064BE3]
I am. It is nice to see everyone together and happy.

Id: [0x00064BE4]
Look at those two kids. it's a lovely sight. Norris is one of my best friends and he couldn't have found a better woman. Proud of him.

Id: [0x00064BE5]
Sometimes people are just right for one and other. Norris and Myriam are a match made in heaven.

Id: [0x00064BE6]
Or a match made by Connor, isn't that right?

Id: [0x00064BE7]
I only helped Norris muster his courage.[a beat]The rest came naturally.

Id: [0x00064BE9]
One day, Doc. One day. You'll find one too. She'll come wandering into the village and light up your life. Mark my words. I'm telling you. I have a sense for these things.

Id: [0x00064BEA]
Might be, might be. Ahoy, Connor! Look at us, three bachelors, waiting for love or waiting for a drink, whatever comes first. [looks in his hand]Drink wins![laugh]

Id: [0x00064BEB]
Women'll be lining up for you Doc! I'm telling you! Ladies love a healer. It's me that's doomed. Who wants to marry a woodworker, eh? Who? Nobody is who.

Id: [0x00064BEC]
Hogwash! You brought the folding chair to the Americas! You're a pioneer! An entrepreneur! Woman appreciate a man with vision.[laugh]

Id: [0x00064BED]
What about you Connor? How is it a man like you has no wife?

Id: [0x00064BEE]
I would not be a good husband. I have not the time to give. One day, perhaps.

Id: [0x00064BEF]
Ha ha ha. Was good for him! Taught him good things don't come easy!

Id: [0x00064C16]
Why the change of heart? Where is this coming from?

Id: [0x00064C17]
You've met your father, haven't you.

Id: [0x00064C19]
I do not claim to trust the man - or even like him. But I would be remiss to ignore this opportunity.

Id: [0x00064C70]
[S√°hsewe! Nek tsi oh niionti√©:ren? Wa‚Äôkanonht√≥nnionhwe t√≥ka‚Äô th√≠:ken √≥:ia r√≥n:kwe aiesen√®:sheke.]You have returned! But why? I thought you would be with that other man.

Id: [0x00064D75]
Is it time to go?

Id: [0x00064D77]
The enemy draws close. Too close, I think...

Id: [0x00064D79]
Perhaps we should move on?

Id: [0x00064D7B]
Shall we fall back?

Id: [0x00064D88]
Do not abandon us as Lee did! Please!

Id: [0x000650E4]
Lafayette promised me a fleet beyond compare, and a captain without peer! Instead I find myself greeted by one old ship and a boy in costume!

Id: [0x000650E5]
I promise we are all you need, Admiral.

Id: [0x000650E6]
I doubt this very much. But beggars do not choose, hmm?

Id: [0x000650E7]
And the ships I require?

Id: [0x000650E8]
They are yours...

Id: [0x000650EA]
...provided we survive this.

Id: [0x000650EB]
And what would you have me do?

Id: [0x000650EC]
Hold the bay while I engage the main fleet. Should any British ships dare approach, destroy them! They must be kept from Yorktown.

Id: [0x000650F9]
What's wrong, cap'n? We should get back on course.

Id: [0x000650FB]
You're goin' the wrong way! Fix your heading.

Id: [0x000650FD]
Come on. We don't have time for this.

Id: [0x000650FF]
Trouble with the wheel, sir? Does it need fixin'?

Id: [0x00065108]
Looks like they're comin' to say hello.

Id: [0x00065109]
Enemy approaching!

Id: [0x0006510A]
Ready yourselves!

Id: [0x0006510B]
Aye aye!

Id: [0x00065117]
My God...

Id: [0x00065119]
Man-of-war!

Id: [0x0006511B]
That beast is sure to sink us if we're not careful.

Id: [0x0006511D]
Man-of-war's firing!

Id: [0x0006511F]
We're under attack!

Id: [0x00065121]
Incoming!

Id: [0x00065124]
Hold this course and we'll lose more than just a couple of cannon.

Id: [0x00065127]
That's half our arsenal gone, Captain! We need to do something!

Id: [0x0006512A]
All our guns are down. We've no way to defend ourselves now!

Id: [0x0006512F]
We're down a ship. Take care...

Id: [0x00065132]
Escorts all sunk. We're on our own now, sir...

Id: [0x00065142]
We won't survive another round of this...

Id: [0x00065150]
We need to change tactics.

Id: [0x00065151]
Aye! Let us fall back.

Id: [0x00065152]
No. I am going aboard to silence her crew. See that the cannons are repaired while I am gone.

Id: [0x00065153]
This is madness! You're alone and we're without reinforcements!

Id: [0x00065158]
You changed your mind, then?

Id: [0x0006515A]
I thought you said you were bringing the Aquila CLOSER to the man-of-war?

Id: [0x0006515C]
Are we leaving, then? Is that what's happening?

Id: [0x0006515E]
Abandoned the plan, have you? Good. 'Bout time you came back to your senses.

Id: [0x00065161]
The ship is yours, Mister Faulkner.

Id: [0x00065163]
I want those cannons working on my return.

Id: [0x00065177]
Captain! Captain!

Id: [0x0006517B]
Hurry!

Id: [0x0006517D]
To me! To me!

Id: [0x0006517F]
Here! Over here!

Id: [0x00065181]
What are you doing?! Get off that ship!

Id: [0x00065186]
You mad bastard...

Id: [0x00065188]
You'll be happy to know we got a few of the cannon working again.

Id: [0x00065189]
Well let's put them to use.

Id: [0x0006518B]
You heard the captain! Give 'em hell, boys!

Id: [0x00065190]
Five of them must enter New York's harbor, flying British flags.

Id: [0x00065195]
Wait, wait. I thought you might need some pirates killed or goods transported...  And instead you ask for us to, what, shell New York?

Id: [0x00065196]
No. Of course not.

Id: [0x00065197]
Ah...

Id: [0x00065199]
Only part of it.

Id: [0x0006519B]
Explain yourself.

Id: [0x0006519C]
I mean to infiltrate Fort George. But it is too well-guarded. Cannon fire will breach its walls and scatter its guards.

Id: [0x0006519D]
And a ship that flies the French flag could never get near it...

Id: [0x0006519E]
You understand, then?

Id: [0x000651A0]
Not at all. But a promise is a promise - even when made to a lunatique (lunatic).

Id: [0x000651A1]
I will light a signal fire when it is time for you to attack.

Id: [0x000651A3]
Vous l'avez entendu! R√©cup√©rez leurs drapeaux qu'on puisse les accrocher. Allez! Vite! (You heard the man! Scavenge their flags that we might fly them. Quickly now!)

Id: [0x000651A9]
Hello Connor! Welcome back.

Id: [0x000651AA]
Is everything in place?

Id: [0x000651AB]
Oui. (Yes.) Lafayette waits for you inside the tunnel beneath the city.

Id: [0x000651AF]
Sometimes I worry... That these Patriots - for all their talk of liberty and equality - will fall back into the old ways!

Id: [0x000651B0]
It will depend greatly on who is chosen to lead them. A man of humble means - who has worked to earn his place... I think a man like that is less likely to dream of thrones.

Id: [0x000651B2]
Connor!

Id: [0x000651B4]
This tunnel will take you into the military district.

Id: [0x000651B5]
And the Admiral?

Id: [0x000651BA]
All men dream of thrones. It is in our nature...

Id: [0x000651BB]
Then what would you do?

Id: [0x000651BC]
Ensure their leader is sterile. Without an heir, the threat of succession is ended - and might be left to the people once more.

Id: [0x000651BD]
He waits for you to light the signal - and then the strike begins!

Id: [0x000651BE]
And we will be there as well!

Id: [0x000652AD]
Need to get... inside the fort...

Id: [0x000652B9]
I am in no condition... to fight... need to stay... away from the guards...

Id: [0x00065347]
[Shout of pain]

Id: [0x0006535A]
You act as though you have some right to judge. To declare me and mine wrong for the world. And yet everything I've shown you - all that I've said and done - should CLEARLY demonstrate otherwise.

Id: [0x0006535C]
We did not harm your people. We did not support the Crown. We worked to see this land united and at peace. Under our rule all would be equal. Do the Patriots promise the same?

Id: [0x0006535D]
They offer freedom.

Id: [0x0006535E]
Which I've told you - time and time again - is dangerous! There will never be consensus, son, amongst those you have helped to ascend. They will each differ in their views of what it means to be free. The peace you so desperately seek does not exist.

Id: [0x0006535F]
No. Together they will forge something new - better than what came before.

Id: [0x00065361]
These men are united now by a common cause. But when this battle's finished they will fall to fighting amongst themselves about how best to ensure control. In time it will lead to war. You'll see.

Id: [0x00065362]
The Patriot leaders do not seek control. There will be no monarch here. The people will have the power - as they should.

Id: [0x00065363]
The people never have the power. Only the illusion of it. And here's the real secret: they don't want it. The responsibility is too great to bear. It is why they are so quick to fall in line as soon as someone takes charge. They WANT to be told what to do. They YEARN for it. Little wonder, that, since all mankind was BUILT to SERVE.

Id: [0x00065364]
So because we are inclined by nature to be controlled, who better than the Templars? It is a poor offer.

Id: [0x00065365]
I see the world as it IS - not as I wish it would be.

Id: [0x00065366]
No, father... You have given up - and would have us all do the same.

Id: [0x0006536D]
Even when your kind appears to triumph... Still we rise again. And do you know why?

Id: [0x0006536F]
It is because the Order is born of a REALIZATION. We require no creed. No indoctrination by desperate old men. All we need is that the world be as it is. And THIS is why the Templars will never be destroyed!

Id: [0x00065370]
But you can.

Id: [0x00065379]
Surrender and I will spare you.

Id: [0x0006537A]
Brave words from a man about to die.

Id: [0x0006537B]
You fare no better.

Id: [0x00065383]
[√ì:nen ki‚Äô w√°hi, r√°ke‚Äôni.]Goodbye, father.

Id: [0x00065385]
I should have killed you long ago.

Id: [0x000653A2]
The tides of war are turning. The Loyalists fall back beneath the advancing Patriot army, their hold on this land weakening by the day. But the Templars only seem to grow stronger. Though fewer in number, the threat they pose appears undiminished. Making matters worse, Washington chose to spare the life of Charles Lee. I am told he has taken refuge inside Fort George, and so my days are spent searching for a way to breach its walls. Of my father, there is no trace. And I am glad of it. If I can be rid of Lee, there may still be a chance for reconciliation - and through it, peace.

Id: [0x000653A9]
Connor?

Id: [0x000653AB]
He's asking for you.

Id: [0x000653B2]
Hello Connor.

Id: [0x000653B4]
Come now. Your sadness won't sustain me any more than that fool woman's soups and potions...

Id: [0x000653B6]
Tell me of your latest exploits.

Id: [0x000653B7]
Charles Lee has been exposed and the Patriots finally rid of him. They march now to secure the remaining cities that this country might finally be free.

Id: [0x000653B8]
Then you have won. The land and your people are safe. [a beat as Achilles watches Connor]Yet you seem troubled...

Id: [0x000653B9]
Washington spared Lee's life.

Id: [0x000653BB]
So long as he lives, all are in danger.

Id: [0x000653BD]
The same is true for your father.

Id: [0x000653BF]
When you first came to me, you understood what had to be done. Swore you'd see it through. If not for the Brotherhood, for your people - and all those threatened by the Templars.

Id: [0x000653C4]
But with Lee gone, my father might...

Id: [0x000653C7]
Listen to me. You have not come this far to throw it all away over misplaced sentiment. Both men must die.

Id: [0x000653C9]
Ach.. Achilles...

Id: [0x000653CA]
There is nothing more to discuss.

Id: [0x000653D0]
Connor! I came as soon as I could.

Id: [0x000653D4]
Tell me you bring good news?

Id: [0x000653D6]
The Comte de Grasse said yes. You need only join his fleet in Chesapeake Bay and they will serve as required. But what exactly is it you intend?

Id: [0x000653D7]
It's better that I show you.

Id: [0x0006545A]
Charles Lee may have been dismissed, but it does not mean we are safe.

Id: [0x0006545B]
But the Commander -

Id: [0x0006545D]
The Commander underestimates the threat and no more time can be wasted trying to convince him otherwise. I must do this on my own.

Id: [0x0006545E]
Do what, exactly?

Id: [0x0006545F]
Kill Charles Lee.

Id: [0x00065461]
He hides within Fort George, which is itself, surrounded by a militarized district. I cannot hope to infiltrate it directly -

Id: [0x00065463]
- so I will go under instead.

Id: [0x00065465]
Incroyable. (Incredible.)

Id: [0x00065466]
The tunnels leading to the fort have been filled in. While I secure the Admiral's ships, I need you to clear them for me.

Id: [0x00065467]
And the ships?

Id: [0x00065469]
When signaled, they will bombard the fort -

Id: [0x0006546B]
In the chaos, I will slip inside, find Charles Lee -

Id: [0x0006546D]
- and silence him forever.

Id: [0x000654E4]
- breaching its walls and creating a distraction. I see!

Id: [0x000654F0]
All those scrolls lead us to the belly of this remote island. Awful out of the way, captain. What was Kidd hidin' for cripe's sake?

Id: [0x000654FE]
Not so bold now, are you, boy?

Id: [0x00065500]
Oh, I hope that wasn't a tooth...

Id: [0x00065993]
Shame we have to keep you alive...

Id: [0x000659A3]
I could do this all day. In fact, I think I will!

Id: [0x000659A5]
Where is Charles Lee gone?

Id: [0x00065AB9]
Careful Cap'n! Those are our allies you're firin' on.

Id: [0x00065ABB]
Don't think we're in the right spot, Connor.

Id: [0x00065ABD]
None of this seems to fit the descriptions.

Id: [0x00065ABF]
We should try somewhere else, don't think we're on the right path.

Id: [0x00065AC1]
No, this can't be right. Maybe we should take a gander elsewhere.

Id: [0x00065AC3]
We'll be here for a week if we don't start making some progress.

Id: [0x00065AC5]
We need to find ONE of these things.

Id: [0x00065AC7]
I won't give up without spotting at least one of 'em.

Id: [0x00065AC9]
Press on. They have to be around here somewhere.

Id: [0x00065ACB]
Ha ha! We're on our way now!

Id: [0x00065ACD]
That's progress. And then what?

Id: [0x00065ACF]
What if...

Id: [0x00065AD1]
What if WHAT, captain? You can't be keeping me in the dark!

Id: [0x00065AD3]
A tree kissed by fire...look for signs of fire I suppose.

Id: [0x00065AD5]
No burn marks over that way, must be around here somewhere.

Id: [0x00065ADA]
Shots fired!

Id: [0x00065ADD]
She's breaking up!

Id: [0x00065ADE]
Ship lost!

Id: [0x00065B0E]
Close to the wolf's abode...

Id: [0x00065B12]
Smells like wet dog, doesn't it? I reckon a wolf den is close by.

Id: [0x00065B15]
The rock that doesn't fit. What does that mean? How do rocks fit?

Id: [0x00065B17]
Maybe a rock that doesn't look like the rest of 'em...

Id: [0x00065B19]
Might be that 'odd' rock is around here somewhere.

Id: [0x00065B26]
Under the eagle's bed. I saw what looked like eagle feathers in this area.

Id: [0x00065B28]
This would be a good spot for an eagle to build its nest.

Id: [0x00065B2A]
You might want to have a look around here for an eagle's nest.

Id: [0x00065B2D]
These small rocks were placed here. They must mean something.

Id: [0x00065B2F]
Perhaps the other way.

Id: [0x00065B31]
A different way. Perhaps if I use the trees as reference.

Id: [0x00065B33]
It might fit in another place.

Id: [0x00065B35]
In the other direction, maybe.

Id: [0x00065B37]
There!

Id: [0x00065B39]
That is it.

Id: [0x00065B3B]
Got it.

Id: [0x00065B3D]
Done.

Id: [0x00065B40]
He's not really planning to board them is he?

Id: [0x00065B42]
Has he lost his mind?

Id: [0x00065B44]
He's going to get us all killed...

Id: [0x00065B47]
I know where it is.

Id: [0x00065B4B]
Bloody wolves on us, captain!

Id: [0x00065B4F]
How in the? You figured it out? Oh! That's why you're the captain!

Id: [0x00065B53]
That's a bloody big piece of stone. Any ideas?

Id: [0x00065B54]
Perhaps some gunpowder would move it.

Id: [0x00065B55]
A nice big explosion eh? Might do the job. Will do well to scare away anymore blasted wolves, that's for certain.

Id: [0x00065B58]
Ought to be enough.

Id: [0x00065B5C]
What are you waiting for, captain? Get in there.

Id: [0x00065B5E]
Nerves got you now? Won't know what's in there 'til you look.

Id: [0x00065B60]
Get in there, sir!

Id: [0x00065B6B]
This is what Captain Kidd suffered over for so long. Astonishing.

Id: [0x00065B71]
There he is! Thought we lost ya there for a moment, captain.

Id: [0x00065B73]
Are you alright?

Id: [0x00065B74]
Yes. I think so.

Id: [0x00065B75]
What happened down there? What did you find?

Id: [0x00065B77]
That's it? A single gold coin? There was nothing else? Was the cache pilfered already?

Id: [0x00065B78]
I do not know how it works but I now understand why Kidd valued it so.

Id: [0x00065B7E]
You haven't much time!

Id: [0x00065B80]
Don't be sinkin' our friends now!

Id: [0x00065B82]
Save your shot for the enemy!

Id: [0x00065B84]
The Admiral won't be able to help us if you've sunk his ships!

Id: [0x00065B86]
I suggest you stop shooting the Frenchies!

Id: [0x00065B88]
Stop and give me what I came for!

Id: [0x00065B8A]
What you carry is mine!

Id: [0x00065B8C]
Hand it over!

Id: [0x00065B8D]
"and abreast the rock that doesn't fit."

Id: [0x00065B92]
To what do I owe this great honor, cap'n?

Id: [0x00065B93]
The letters you speak of. What are they?

Id: [0x00065B94]
Oh, NOW ya wanna know! Cap'n Kidd's letters, boy!  He hid a great treasure somewheres and sent letters to four of his crewmen along with a strange piece of leather. If ya find the men, ya'll find the scallywag! It's that easy, 'tis.

Id: [0x00065B95]
May I see them?

Id: [0x00065B96]
Ha! Ya might be a cap'n but ya're not too bright are ya? I'll barter with 'em. You give me some trinkets I like and I'll give you a letter. Building me own treasure cache, see.

Id: [0x00065B99]
What ya got for me?

Id: [0x00065B9B]
Ha! Ya brought me some good pieces. That's worth a letter to be sure. Here ya go cap'n!

Id: [0x00065B9C]
I will be back for the rest.

Id: [0x00065BA1]
Got some more? Let's 'ave a look, then.

Id: [0x00065BA3]
More keepers, good on ya. I'd say that's worth another letter.

Id: [0x00065BA9]
That won't do it, boy. Get some more and then we'll barter.

Id: [0x00065BAC]
What's he got this time? Lemme see, lemme see.

Id: [0x00065BAE]
A VERITABLE BOUNTY! SHIVER ME TIMBERS! That'll earn ya one o' these scripts to be sure!

Id: [0x00065BB2]
Not to hang the jib but 'tis not 'nough. Ya'll seed some more.

Id: [0x00065BB8]
Back again? Wadaya got for me?

Id: [0x00065BBA]
Blow me o'er! You've earned the last of these blasted things. Be sure to let me know what you find! Ha ha ha.

Id: [0x00065BBC]
Ya addled, boy? That's not near enough.

Id: [0x00065BBE]
If ya be trying to run a rig, I won't have it. Find some more.

Id: [0x00065BD3]
We've lost the cannons!

Id: [0x00065BD4]
Where are our blasted reinforcements?

Id: [0x00065BD5]
They will come. We must hold the bay until they do.

Id: [0x00065C67]
What do you make of it?

Id: [0x00065C68]
They all appear to be parts of the same piece<br>of leather...

Id: [0x00065C6A]
That's Oak Island. I've sailed passed it half a hundred times. A forgettable isle to say the least.

Id: [0x00065C6B]
The location seems to be the easy part.

Id: [0x00065C6C]
Aye, and we'll be waiting for you the moment you want to get after it.

Id: [0x00065C6F]
Ya actually found somethin'? Ha ha ha!

Id: [0x00065C76]
I will need to slide down.

Id: [0x00065C79]
That water will kill me.

Id: [0x00065C7B]
I must not get caught in here.

Id: [0x00065C7D]
It is rising very fast.

Id: [0x00065C80]
The shot must have come from the balcony.

Id: [0x00065C83]
Kidd's treasure is probably inside that pyramid.

Id: [0x00065C84]
Trinkets? Like what? Where?

Id: [0x00065C85]
Use yer imagination, cap'n. There's interestin' swag all over the frontier.

Id: [0x00065CD7]
Let's see what you got, rebel.

Id: [0x00065CD8]
The killer must have chased his prey, but through where?

Id: [0x00065CD9]
There must be a way to the main hall from here.

Id: [0x00065CE9]
He must have written the answer somewhere.

Id: [0x00065CEA]
I do not know, but I am intrigued to find out.

Id: [0x00065CEB]
Possibly.

Id: [0x00065CEC]
I got a hunch that fire kissin' tree's in this area.

Id: [0x00065CED]
Wolf tracks all around here. We looking for a den maybe?

Id: [0x00065CF2]
How?

Id: [0x00065CF7]
What the devil!?

Id: [0x00065CFA]
We have Haytham to thank for this. He and all those others who sacrificed for our cause. But he was not content merely to save the people of America. No - he sought to save those sworn to our destruction. He sought to save the Assassins!

Id: [0x00065D01]
No. You WANT to know it. You WANT it to be true. Part of me once did as well. But it is an impossible dream.

Id: [0x00065D05]
No, son. We are enemies. And one of us must die.

Id: [0x00065D06]
"It lies under the eagles's bed, near the wolf's abode, close to a tree kissed by fire and abreast the rock that does not fit." And a route to an island. The symbols remain elusive.

Id: [0x00065D0A]
I need to find a way back up to the treasure room.

Id: [0x00065D11]
That's a curious little piece isn't it? Well, I've worked my incredible and bottomless magic and that little thing is in fact of First Civilization origin. It seems they used them as personal shields. It gives off a rather powerful electromagnetic field- explains its aversion to metal. Also explains why Kidd's legend tells of him being invincible. Having that trinket in your pocket would easily bend a musket ball's trajectory. Nifty little thing, really. Anyway, just thought you'd want to know, please do carry on!

Id: [0x00065D17]
A temporary setback. He will be restored.

Id: [0x00065D1A]
We are blood, you and I. Please...

Id: [0x00065D1D]
You act as though you have some right to judge.

Id: [0x00065D1E]
To declare me and mine wrong for the world.

Id: [0x00065D1F]
And yet everything I've shown you - all I've said and done - should CLEARLY demonstrate otherwise.

Id: [0x00065D21]
We did not harm your people.

Id: [0x00065D22]
We did not support the Crown.

Id: [0x00065D23]
We worked to see this land united and at peace.

Id: [0x00065D24]
Under our rule all would be equal.

Id: [0x00065D25]
Do the Patriots promise the same?

Id: [0x00065D26]
They offer freedom.

Id: [0x00065D27]
Which I've told you - time and time again - is dangerous!

Id: [0x00065D28]
There will never be consensus, son, amongst those you have helped to ascend.

Id: [0x00065D29]
They will each differ in their views of what it means to be free.

Id: [0x00065D2A]
The peace you so desperately seek does not exist.

Id: [0x00065D2B]
No. Together they will forge something new - better than what came before.

Id: [0x00065D2D]
These men are united now by a common cause.

Id: [0x00065D2E]
But when this battle is finished they will fall to fighting amongst themselves about how best to ensure control.

Id: [0x00065D2F]
In time it will lead to war.

Id: [0x00065D30]
You will see.

Id: [0x00065D31]
The Patriot leaders do not seek control.

Id: [0x00065D32]
There will be no monarch here.

Id: [0x00065D33]
The people will have the power - as they should.

Id: [0x00065D34]
The people never have the power.

Id: [0x00065D35]
Only the illusion of it.

Id: [0x00065D36]
And here's the real secret: they don't want it.

Id: [0x00065D37]
The responsibility is too great to bear.

Id: [0x00065D38]
It's why they are so quick to fall in line as soon as someone takes charge.

Id: [0x00065D39]
They WANT to be told what to do.

Id: [0x00065D3A]
They YEARN for it.

Id: [0x00065D3B]
Little wonder, that, since all mankind was BUILT to SERVE.

Id: [0x00065D3C]
So because we are inclined by nature to be controlled, who better than the Templars?

Id: [0x00065D3D]
It is a poor offer.

Id: [0x00065D3E]
It is truth!

Id: [0x00065D3F]
Principle and practice are two very different beasts.

Id: [0x00065D41]
No, father... You have given up - and would have us all do the same.

Id: [0x00065D43]
It is truth! Principle and practice are two very different beasts. I see the world as it IS - not as I wish it would be.

Id: [0x00065D45]
What did you expect, walking into the lion's den like ya did?

Id: [0x00065D46]
The harbor... to catch a ferry...

Id: [0x00065E0D]
The other clocks might tell me something.

Id: [0x00066269]
They will lead me to Lee...

Id: [0x0006626C]
I believe these men meet your requirements.

Id: [0x0006626E]
You believe incorrectly. They're sick and weak. We're looking to build an army not fill an almshouse.

Id: [0x0006626F]
No. Please. We'll do anything you want. Anything! Only take us with you!

Id: [0x00066270]
Your merchandise is useless to us.

Id: [0x0006627A]
Perhaps we should discuss this back in my cabin?

Id: [0x0006627F]
No need to be rash. Only give me a little more time. I'll scour the other ships if I must. I'm certain there are prisoners who will meet your needs.

Id: [0x00066280]
Very well. You have two days.

Id: [0x00066282]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000662BE]
Need something, darling?

Id: [0x000662BF]
No.

Id: [0x000662C1]
Rude.

Id: [0x000662C6]
Can I help you?

Id: [0x000662C7]
You know you can.

Id: [0x000662C8]
Pardon?

Id: [0x000662CA]
S-stop that. D-don't make me call the guards.

Id: [0x000662CB]
Make a sound and you die.

Id: [0x000662CC]
What do you want?

Id: [0x000662CD]
He headed inland. Took a ferry up the Charles River.

Id: [0x000662CE]
I do not like having my time wasted.

Id: [0x000662D0]
He's in the harbor. At the long pier, most likely. We heard what happened at the parade. Charles got all nervous - said he was leaving the country. I thought he was overreacting. Guess not.

Id: [0x000662D2]
Thank you.

Id: [0x000662F2]
Why do you persist...? You put us down. We rise again. You end one plot - we forge another. You try so hard... But it always ends the same...

Id: [0x000662F4]
Those who know you think you mad and this is why... Even those men you sought to save have turned their backs on you. Yet you fight. You resist. [a beat]Why?

Id: [0x000662F5]
Because no one else will.

Id: [0x000662FB]
What do ya reckon?

Id: [0x000662FC]
'E moved a bit, before.

Id: [0x000662FD]
Don't mean nuttin. Da says bodies fill up with bad air - makes 'em do all manner of strange things.

Id: [0x000662FE]
I 'eard people fill their breeches when they die. Is his breeches brown?

Id: [0x000662FF]
Don't look like it. Don't smell like it, neither. But I'm not about to be pullin down some dead man's pants.

Id: [0x00066300]
It's too much blood. He's gotta be dead. See?

Id: [0x00066301]
Stop... poking... me...

Id: [0x00066306]
[Scream]

Id: [0x00066307]
[Scream]

Id: [0x00066319]
[laugh]Rough night, was it?

Id: [0x00066321]
I will need passage as well.

Id: [0x00066322]
Of course. Only say the word.

Id: [0x000663AF]
Oye! Oye! With the Treaty of Paris having been signed and soon to be ratified by the Congress of the Confederation, today marks the first day of true independence! The last of the King's troops now board ships meant to carry them back to Britain. May they never set foot here again!

Id: [0x000663BB]
Why would they leave this behind?

Id: [0x000663BE]
Remember... You must hide the amulet where none might find it...

Id: [0x00066469]
You want it? Fine. Here it is.

Id: [0x00066475]
[pain vocalizations]

Id: [0x00066477]
[pain vocalizations]

Id: [0x00066479]
Mister! Please! Can you help me?

Id: [0x0006647B]
Some aid, sir! If it please you.

Id: [0x0006647D]
Praise be to God! I was reaping my yield and these lobsterbacks attacked me. I mean only to sell my produce in the borough. Please, they sent for reinforcements when I fought back. I only need to finish the harvest and I cannot rebuff them alone.

Id: [0x00066481]
Get back!

Id: [0x00066483]
Leave me be! This is not yours!

Id: [0x00066485]
I'll have you!

Id: [0x00066487]
Where are you going!?

Id: [0x00066489]
[death vocalization]

Id: [0x0006648B]
Don't leave me!

Id: [0x0006648D]
Thank you stranger! This food will sell fast at a regular price- those men have been seizing everything and driving up the cost. It's not right.

Id: [0x0006648F]
I don't much care where you find it, just get me the money or you'll suffer the consequences and be removed from you home. It's not complicated.

Id: [0x00066492]
You owe what you owe and there's nothing else to be said about it. Pay me or my associates will discharge you and your family from your residence, by force. Your choice.

Id: [0x00066493]
But I never did nothing for you! Why do I owe you anything?!

Id: [0x00066494]
I don't want to deal with anybody! I've never seen any of you before in my life!

Id: [0x00066496]
Oh, good day, sir. Have you come to pay this gentleman's debts? How nice of you.

Id: [0x00066498]
Ha! The city could use more 'good Samaritans' like yourself. I have a few other debts to collect, maybe you could save me the trouble!

Id: [0x0006649A]
What's this? Teach him a lesson.

Id: [0x0006649F]
Darling, take the children and stay out of sight.

Id: [0x000664A2]
I don't know what possessed you to do such a thing, but I thank you sir. A thousand times.

Id: [0x000664A5]
Bloody business that was, but I thank you nonetheless. I can rest easy knowing this extortionist won't be back threatenin' my family.

Id: [0x00066515]
If you could spare a bite for us? We'd be in your debt, sir.

Id: [0x0006652B]
Anything. We'll take anything you can offer us.

Id: [0x000665A3]
These two chase us and beat us when they can. If you could draw 'em away. We could take just enough to fill our bellies for the night.

Id: [0x000665CC]
What do you think you're doing!?

Id: [0x000665CE]
Hey! Where you going?!

Id: [0x000665D0]
Oh no you don't.

Id: [0x000665D1]
You're not getting away with that.

Id: [0x000665D5]
You're asking for it.

Id: [0x000665D7]
Got a problem, mate?

Id: [0x000665D9]
Thanks mister!

Id: [0x000668FE]
What the bloody hell was that about?

Id: [0x000668FF]
[breathing]The older man is a Templar. Who was he with?

Id: [0x00066900]
A Templar? The young buck was Nicholas Biddle. Nobody. Sails before the mast- midshipman for the Crown.

Id: [0x00066901]
Are the guns ready?

Id: [0x00066902]
Aye, but we won't jump in over our heads. We'll find a suitable target and show you how they work. We've fitted her with a modest amount of guns to start but rest assured there's ample room to add more should you feel the need.

Id: [0x00066D37]
Might I have a word? Name's Dobby Carter. Couldn't help but notice you're getting involved in the goings on in our borough. Thought we might be of service to each other.

Id: [0x00066D38]
What is happening here?

Id: [0x00066D39]
Ever since the war kicked-off merchants have been demanding high prices 'for the good of the cause'. Profiteering is what that is.  It's high time the folks 'round the way got a fair shake.

Id: [0x00066D41]
How can I help?

Id: [0x00066D42]
That easy? That's a change. Eh... Set these up nearby when you get a chance- it's part of a bigger plan I got. Come see me when you're done.

Id: [0x00066D45]
Merchants are still gouging people around here. We'll talk again soon.

Id: [0x00066DD4]
While you were putting a stop to this madness I was sniffing out who's responsible.

Id: [0x00066DD5]
His tactics are familiar to me.

Id: [0x00066DD6]
Is that right? Well, don't know who the man is but he's not for Patriots nor British. He's got a fortified camp built around the main water supply in the area. All the seized crops, all the meat, everything is being moved there then resold at dizzying prices.

Id: [0x00066DE8]
How do we get in?

Id: [0x00066DE9]
I got some local men ready to get in on the fight.

Id: [0x00066FB9]
Here we are, sirs.

Id: [0x00066FBC]
You can't go in there!

Id: [0x00066FBD]
There's been an accident!

Id: [0x000674B8]
Ah! A fellow Londoner! Good to see I'm not the only man of means aboard. Rupert Martin, pleased to meet you.

Id: [0x000674B9]
Haytham Kenway. Pleasure.

Id: [0x000674BA]
Seems we picked an excellent time to leave the city.

Id: [0x000674BF]
Oh?

Id: [0x000674C0]
You didn't hear about the murder at the opera house?

Id: [0x000674C1]
No. What happened?

Id: [0x000674C2]
They're still trying to sort it all out. And I suspect they'll be at it for a good long while.

Id: [0x000674C3]
Any word on the motive?

Id: [0x000674C4]
They've ruled out robbery. So perhaps it was a business arrangement gone sour. Or something more personal... more lurid. Who knows. But I am glad to be away from it. The city grows more dangerous by the day.

Id: [0x000674C5]
Captain.

Id: [0x000674C6]
Mister Kenway.

Id: [0x000674C7]
I just wanted to thank you again for taking me aboard, and apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.

Id: [0x000674C8]
Inconvenience would be an understatement.

Id: [0x000674CD]
Good morning, Doctor.

Id: [0x000674CE]
To you as well.

Id: [0x000674CF]
A question, if I may. Do you serve aboard the ship? Or are you simply taking passage?

Id: [0x000674D0]
A bit of both, actually. I've been commissioned by the royal navy to study maritime illness. I'll be observing the crew during the journey. We have found that sailors fare far better on the open seas than the rest of us. I hope to discover why that is.

Id: [0x000674D1]
Well, I hope you are successful in your endeavors.

Id: [0x000674D2]
As do I. Thank you for the kind words.

Id: [0x000674D3]
Hello, sir.

Id: [0x000674D4]
Do you expect we'll have a pleasant crossing?

Id: [0x000674D5]
It is a quiet time of year - though rogue storms and troubled waters are not unheard of. But no need to fret. At worst they'll prove an inconvenience. I'm more concerned about pirates and rogue privateers.

Id: [0x000674D6]
Have you encountered them before?

Id: [0x000674D7]
Aye. But the Providence is a strong ship - and her crew well trained. They will surely keep us safe.

Id: [0x000674D9]
...and then all will be well.

Id: [0x000674DA]
You sure 'bout that?

Id: [0x000674DB]
Of course! Have I ever led you astray?

Id: [0x000674DC]
Nah... But it don't sit right wit' the others.

Id: [0x000674DD]
Have faith, my friend. You'll see.

Id: [0x0006765A]
Curious.

Id: [0x000676CD]
A word, please - Mister Kenway?

Id: [0x00067721]
I don't care for you, Mister Kenway. I've had nothing but trouble since you came aboard.

Id: [0x00067722]
Your problems have nothing to do with me.

Id: [0x00067723]
I beg your pardon!

Id: [0x00067724]
You're a poor leader, ill-tempered and cruel. And it's clear your crew has no respect for you.

Id: [0x00067727]
Look - I don't want to argue. In fact, I need a favor...

Id: [0x00067728]
Oh? This is rich...

Id: [0x0006772A]
Excellent! Good day.

Id: [0x00067732]
Mister Kenway.

Id: [0x00067733]
Captain.

Id: [0x00067734]
Whatever they're up to - I believe it's coming to a head.

Id: [0x00067736]
Then I'd best get to work.

Id: [0x00067737]
Someone needs to have words with him.

Id: [0x00067738]
Mills tried! Captain turned him away.

Id: [0x00067739]
Then he must try again! With more force if need be...

Id: [0x0006773B]
But what?

Id: [0x0006773C]
I've a wife and two daughters. What if it goes wrong...

Id: [0x0006773D]
There's no one aboard doesn't agree with us! Longer we wait - the longer we go without.

Id: [0x00067742]
Have you taken ill?

Id: [0x00067743]
Nothing like that. I was wondering if you'd heard any rumblings of trouble aboard.

Id: [0x00067746]
Do you know who might?

Id: [0x00067747]
Ship's cook and doctor bout the only folks with any free time. You'll find them on the lower deck.

Id: [0x00067748]
Won't be serving for another couple hours. Some biscuits in the barrel if you're desperate.

Id: [0x00067749]
What's that?

Id: [0x0006774A]
Have any of the men been acting strange recently? Said anything that struck you as out of the ordinary?

Id: [0x0006774D]
Are you James?

Id: [0x0006774E]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006774F]
Haytham Kenway. Pleased to meet you.

Id: [0x00067750]
I know who you are.

Id: [0x00067751]
I was hoping you could answer some questions.

Id: [0x00067753]
I figured as much... But not here.

Id: [0x00067755]
Follow me.

Id: [0x00067757]
Have you seen or heard anything out of the ordinary since we left port? Anything that gives cause for concern?

Id: [0x00067765]
Oh. Not your best move...

Id: [0x00067768]
What brings you topside?

Id: [0x00067769]
Take care where you tread. The deck hides all manner of danger in the dark...

Id: [0x0006776B]
Someone's throwing cargo overboard... But why?

Id: [0x00067771]
Why are they doing this?

Id: [0x00067772]
Near as I can tell, the barrels serve as  markers. They're leaving a trail. I fear it is only a matter of time before whoever's following it -

Id: [0x00067777]
Arrival? I see no land... only this interminable fog.

Id: [0x000677D3]
That should slow them down!

Id: [0x000677D7]
A perfect shot!

Id: [0x000677D9]
Bought us some time, sir!

Id: [0x000677DD]
We'll push these Redcoats back, yet!

Id: [0x000677E4]
We're almost there so listen up. The artifact is in an office penthouse in lower Manhattan. At this time of night direct infiltration is going to get you noticed. I think we're better off having you drop in from above.

Id: [0x000677E5]
What do you mean, above?

Id: [0x000677E9]
Can you hear me? Testing. Testing. One. Two. Three.

Id: [0x000677EA]
Yup! Read you just fine. Now why don't you power up the camera...

Id: [0x00067930]
There are too many of them. I must keep my distance from those camps.

Id: [0x00067A15]
I've got picture. Running diagnostics.

Id: [0x00067A1C]
Perfect! I've got a nice, strong signal.

Id: [0x00067A28]
He was a madman!

Id: [0x00067A29]
Not mad, beguiled by a set of dangerous but attractive ideals.

Id: [0x00067A2A]
Is that right? And who exactly are you?

Id: [0x00067A2B]
Someone who seeks to relieve men like him of their power.

Id: [0x00067A2C]
After seeing what you can do, I'll leave it at that. But if you ever need an extra blade, I'll stand by you.

Id: [0x00067A4C]
Just a heads up - there's no elevator access from here on out. You'll have to get up there the old fashioned way.

Id: [0x00067A4F]
Ahhh, What the hell was that...

Id: [0x00067A50]
Sorry. Feedback. Guess I got too close to some of the equipment.

Id: [0x00067A51]
Bravo, Rebecca. Slow clap.

Id: [0x00067A52]
Shut up, Shaun.

Id: [0x00067A54]
Jesus...

Id: [0x00067A55]
Look on the bright side - no security to worry about.

Id: [0x00067A56]
So you must be Desmond. Not exactly what I expected. But I guess your kind doesn't have many options these days.

Id: [0x00067A57]
Who are you?

Id: [0x00067A58]
Ask your father.

Id: [0x00067A5A]
Now give me that.

Id: [0x00067A5C]
I don't think so.

Id: [0x00067A6F]
Look - I'm not supposed to kill you, but the bossman didn't say anything about fucking you up. So you've got to the count of - Uh! Arg!

Id: [0x00067A73]
Believe it or not, he used to be an Assassin. THE Assassin, the way I've heard it told. But it turned out he was a sleeper agent for Abstergo, programmed to infiltrate and destroy the organization.

Id: [0x00067A76]
Somebody stop it! Please! They're going to be shot!

Id: [0x00067A78]
How did he know you were there? We could be compromised...

Id: [0x00067A79]
They must have caught me snooping inside their network and sent Cross to see what we were after. If they were aware of our current location, we'd know. Though I will say this - it doesn't bode very well for future expeditions.

Id: [0x00067B06]
They got no trial! Somebody help!

Id: [0x00067B08]
Help them! They're before a firing line! Nobody told us why! You need to stop it!

Id: [0x00067B09]
Where are they?

Id: [0x00067B0C]
It's this way!

Id: [0x00067B0E]
We must hurry!

Id: [0x00067B10]
Come on! Come on!

Id: [0x00067B15]
You draw closer... Two remain... and the key... Find them... He will show you...

Id: [0x00067B17]
These men have been found guilty of treason and conspiracy, crimes punishable by death, the sentence to be carried out forthwith before these witnesses.

Id: [0x00067B18]
They didn't do nothing! Please stop!

Id: [0x00067B1A]
Ready! [beat]Aim! [beat]Fire!

Id: [0x00067B1E]
Psst! Hey!

Id: [0x00067B20]
Patriot! Got a moment?

Id: [0x00067B22]
Not British either, by the looks of it. I caught a bullet from one of them Redcoats. They're after me for something I know.  They're locking the neighborhood down but I need to get to my boss at the docks.

Id: [0x00067B24]
I am no Patriot.

Id: [0x00067B27]
I'll tell you something, mate. This state of martial law that's around us? It's not the work of the British. It's somebody else.

Id: [0x00067B28]
Who?

Id: [0x00067B29]
Can't tell you that. Not that I don't trust you, but you can't be too careful these days.

Id: [0x00067B2B]
They're on us, friend!

Id: [0x00067B2D]
Can't take much more!

Id: [0x00067B2F]
Get them off me!

Id: [0x00067B31]
Arg!

Id: [0x00067B33]
Come on!

Id: [0x00067B35]
Won't last too long like this!

Id: [0x00067B37]
Don't leave me!

Id: [0x00067B39]
What are you doing, mate?

Id: [0x00067B3B]
I won't make it there alone!

Id: [0x00067B3E]
That wasn't easy. Thank you, friend. [beat]If you see any men wearing red crosses on their person, steer clear.

Id: [0x00067B42]
You the one they sent? Where you been? Anyway, I know who the traitors are. They've got lists of all the Patriot leaders in the area. If they hand them over to the Redcoats the rebellion is finished in this part of the city. You need to find a way to switch these fake ones for the real thing.

Id: [0x00067B46]
Martial law's not so bad so long as you're friends with the right people. And I'm friends with the right people.

Id: [0x00067B47]
I really must be getting off the streets.

Id: [0x00067B48]
Not if you're with me. Come on, let me get you a cup of tea and we can take the air. When was the last time you went to a tea house?

Id: [0x00067B49]
Not since all this started.

Id: [0x00067B4A]
Exactly.

Id: [0x00067B4D]
Ahhhh.

Id: [0x00067B4E]
Go on, ya got deep pockets. A penny for a cup a stew is all I ask.

Id: [0x00067B4F]
Leave me be.

Id: [0x00067B50]
Ya leave a starving man on the street? God will look down upon you.

Id: [0x00067B53]
I said piss-off.

Id: [0x00067B54]
Damn you. Damn you to hell.

Id: [0x00067B57]
What's this poppycock? Half these people are known Loyalists and fervent supporters of the Regulars. Deal with this crook, boys.

Id: [0x00067B5C]
Would you look at that. Captain will be happy about this. Here's a few pounds for your trouble.

Id: [0x00067B5F]
Almost there, Desmond. Once you reach the top of the lit-up crane, you should be high enough to make the jump.

Id: [0x00067B60]
Should?

Id: [0x00067B61]
It'll be fine. Don't worry.

Id: [0x00067B62]
Well - you might want to worry a little. I'm pretty sure she was high when she was running the numbers.

Id: [0x00067B63]
Shaun!

Id: [0x00067B64]
A joke. It was a joke... [a beat]Or was it?

Id: [0x00067B67]
Jump when you're ready, but wait for my signal to open the chute. Timing's really important here. Too soon or too late and you'll miss the building.

Id: [0x00067B69]
Okay. Here goes...

Id: [0x00067B6E]
Now! Open your chute now.

Id: [0x00067B70]
Desmond?!

Id: [0x00067B72]
Come on! You're running out of time!

Id: [0x00067B8E]
That wasn't so bad.

Id: [0x00067BEF]
You there, Rebecca?

Id: [0x00067BF0]
Bad reception. Can you hear me?

Id: [0x00067BF1]
Well, glad to see that's working. Guess I'll try you back when I'm topside.

Id: [0x00067BF3]
You copy now?

Id: [0x00067BF4]
Loud and clear.

Id: [0x00067BF5]
Now to find a ticket.

Id: [0x00067BFF]
What's the plan?

Id: [0x00067C00]
According to our intel, the power source is being worn as a bracelet by some tycoon's trophy wife. We're working on pinpointing her location, but she's most likely inside a VIP booth on the stadium's upper level. I'll update you when I know more.

Id: [0x00067C09]
We don't have time to play nice, steal someone else's.

Id: [0x00067C0D]
Your target's definitely in the VIP area. The entrance is at the end of this concourse.

Id: [0x00067C0F]
That doesn't look like normal security...

Id: [0x00067C10]
Because it isn't. Those are Abstergo agents. Cross is probably here too. You need to be careful.

Id: [0x00067D31]
Great. They've set up a checkpoint...

Id: [0x00067D32]
Stick close to the crowd and you should be okay... Or look for a way around it.

Id: [0x00067D38]
So you are the man taking up arms in our part of the city. Glad to be hearing it.

Id: [0x00067D39]
The military seems to be controlling this area.

Id: [0x00067D3A]
Yah. Martial Law has been declared. For what purposes, I do not know but there is not a need. I do what I can but it is hard.

Id: [0x00067D3B]
I may be able to help.

Id: [0x00067D3F]
Seriously, what is the deal with stadiums and piss troughs. It's disgusting. And who thought they were a good idea?

Id: [0x00067D40]
Troughs are time and cost-efficient.

Id: [0x00067D41]
I don't even see a stall in here. What if I had to take a dump?

Id: [0x00067D42]
Yeah. Please, just mute the microphone if you do.

Id: [0x00067D47]
Looks like I'm close...

Id: [0x00067D49]
Shit. Another checkpoint.

Id: [0x00067D4A]
[Se n√£o me deixar entrar, vou perder o emprego!]If you don't let me through I'm going to lose my job!

Id: [0x00067D4B]
[Temos que verificar sua identidade.]We need to verify your identity.

Id: [0x00067D4C]
[Como assim? Trabalho aqui h√° quinze anos e nunca vi nada como isso! Quem voc√™s pensam que s√£o?]What? I've worked here for fifteen years and I've never seen anything like this! Who are you people?

Id: [0x00067D4D]
[Sugiro abaixar o tom de voz.]I suggest you lower your voice.

Id: [0x00067D4E]
[Est√° bem! Fa√ßa a porcaria da verifica√ß√£o!]Fine! Do your stupid check!

Id: [0x00067D57]
We have waited millennia for your arrival. You - who will bring to him the last piece. That he may open the door.

Id: [0x00067D58]
I do not understand.

Id: [0x00067D59]
Nor need you.

Id: [0x00067D5B]
I sense my words cause pain... But such was not my intention. You are important, child. In more ways than you will ever know.

Id: [0x00067D5D]
Yours is a special lineage. Past. Present. Future. Many are connected to you. Many who have changed the world. Who will change the world. So too, shall you.

Id: [0x00067D5F]
I have called you here that you might know your duty. You must protect the sanctuary from those who would undo our work.

Id: [0x00067D62]
Where is your leader?

Id: [0x00067D63]
You'll never get to him. He's surrounded by twice as many men, twice as tough as this lot.

Id: [0x00067D65]
Who commands you?

Id: [0x00067D66]
Never met the man- don't even know his name.  Cagy as they come. Paranoid and suspicious of everyone and everything. Please. Don't kill me.

Id: [0x00067D68]
How do I find your leader?

Id: [0x00067D69]
You don't. He moves his floating fortress around the harbor so nobody knows where he is.

Id: [0x00067D6B]
When will your boss be here next?

Id: [0x00067D6C]
A few days! Let me go! I beg you!

Id: [0x00067D6E]
How do I meet your commander?

Id: [0x00067D6F]
Won't happen. He only trusts his closest men. Even if you find him, you won't get anywhere near him.

Id: [0x00067D76]
We were just discussing the result of your work. It seems these military men are after you.

Id: [0x00067D77]
I have caught their attention.

Id: [0x00067D78]
It does make our goals harder to achieve. The man we're after has gone into hiding, protected by his soldiers.

Id: [0x00067D79]
We fight our way in, then.

Id: [0x00067D7A]
Not possible. Even for a man of your abilities. But I have another- less conventional- idea. You will be our prisoner and we shall present you for the bounty.

Id: [0x00067D7D]
You're gonna have to find another way around. Security's too tight here.

Id: [0x00067D82]
[Que bando de merdinhas. Passam 20 minutos simulando sexo anal e faturam milh√µes. Eu quebro as costas trabalhando 80 horas por semana para tirar 100 pratas e olhe l√°. E agora tenho que ficar aqui para ser insultado por um brutamonte de terno...]These pieces of shit - they spend 20 minutes simulating anal sex and walk off with millions. I break my back working 80 hour weeks and I'm lucky to make 100 reals. And now I have to stand here and get insulted by some thug wearing a suit...

Id: [0x00067E24]
[Olha, aconteceu, s√≥ isso... A gente n√£o queria que acontecesse. S√≥... aconteceu. Sinto muito.]Look - It just sort of happened... We didn't mean for it to. It just... did. I'm sorry.

Id: [0x00067E25]
[Sente muito? Ela √© minha irm√£, cara! A porra da minha irm√£zinha!]You're sorry? She's my sister, man! My fucking little sister!

Id: [0x00067E26]
[A gente se ama. Pronto, t√° a√≠. T√° dito. A gente se ama e j√° faz MUITO tempo.]We're in love. Okay. There. I said it. We're in love and we've BEEN in love for a long time.

Id: [0x00067E27]
[Eu achava que era meu melhor amigo e voc√™ a√≠ transando com minha irm√£zinha pelas minhas costas!]You're supposed to be my best friend and here you are banging my sister behind my back!

Id: [0x00067E2C]
[Voc√™ devia estar feliz por n√≥s. Vou cuidar dela direito. Voc√™ vai ver.]You should be happy for us. I'll take good care of her. You'll see.

Id: [0x00067E2E]
[Vai para puta que te pariu!]Go visit the bitch that gave birth to you!

Id: [0x00067EBD]
Look at that! They got the lout! Well done, mate.

Id: [0x00067EBE]
You're gonna get what's coming to you half-breed.

Id: [0x00067EC0]
That him? Doesn't look like much.

Id: [0x00067EC1]
Doesn't matter now does it? The commander'll have his way with him. I wish I could be there to see.

Id: [0x00067EC3]
Ha ha. Look at this sorry prat. Fun's over, eh nigit?

Id: [0x00067EC4]
Nice one on the capture! Commander's going to be a happy man.

Id: [0x00067ECC]
What are you working on?

Id: [0x00067ECD]
Lots of different stuff. If you're going into the field, we need a way to keep tabs on you and stay in touch. Hacking into local security systems won't cut it.

Id: [0x00067ECE]
Thanks.

Id: [0x00067ECF]
For what?

Id: [0x00067EDB]
People! Bear witness to what happens to rebels in my part of New York. These men defied the curfew set in place for your safety. They assaulted his majesty's soldiers and conspired against the authority of the military. Such blatant disregard for the protocols designed to protect the citizens of New York will be punished by death. We seek not to control you. To oppress you. We seek only to ensure your safety in the face of conflict and aggression. The civilians of New York must be protected at all costs, no matter their allegiance. It seems that these three men sought to jeopardize your wellbeing. I will not tolerate it. Form up!

Id: [0x00067EDE]
Get ready!

Id: [0x00067EE6]
You're really close now. The power source should be in one of the rooms up here.

Id: [0x00067EE9]
Help me! He's got a -

Id: [0x00067EF6]
[O que diabos est√° acontecendo?]The hell is going on?

Id: [0x00067EF7]
[Ei! Olha por onde anda!]Hey! Watch where you're going!

Id: [0x00067EF8]
[Qual √© o seu problema?!]What's your problem?!

Id: [0x00067EF9]
[Aquele cara t√° maluco!]That guy's nuts!

Id: [0x00067EFA]
[Algu√©m chama a seguran√ßa!]Someone call security!

Id: [0x00067F01]
I fucked up, Warren... I fucked up...

Id: [0x00067F03]
Ran out of bullets! Can you believe that shit? Out of fucking bullets! He almost had me... Jesus.

Id: [0x00067F05]
What do you mean, calm down? I am calm. I'm fine. I AM A-O-FUCKING-KAY!

Id: [0x00067F07]
Sorry. Sorry. Got a little, uh... You know. I'm on edge man. Always on edge. Losing my goddam mind...

Id: [0x00067F09]
Of course I have it. Wonder what it does... Why do you think they're after these?

Id: [0x00067F0B]
Right. Good idea. Soon as I get back. Just a few hours inside. It'll help. It always helps... Alright. I'll wait here for evac.

Id: [0x00067F0D]
What's wrong with him?

Id: [0x00067F0F]
Hurry Desmond.

Id: [0x00067F11]
Grab the power source and get out of there...

Id: [0x00067F13]
He's going to bolt as soon as he's off the phone...

Id: [0x00067F15]
If he gets away with the artifact, we're screwed. You can't let that happen.

Id: [0x00067F17]
Okay, head for the metro. I'll hold the train for you.

Id: [0x00067F1B]
There he is!

Id: [0x00067F1F]
Better move!

Id: [0x00067F25]
Look at that! I've found a third power source!

Id: [0x00067F26]
I guess Connor will have to wait.

Id: [0x00067F27]
No. You stay. We need to find that key - and time is running out. I'll make the trip.

Id: [0x00067F28]
What about Cross?

Id: [0x00067F2D]
Everything's going to be fine. I'll be back soon.

Id: [0x00067F2F]
Something's happened Desmond...

Id: [0x00067F34]
Abstergo has your dad.

Id: [0x00067F36]
Where?

Id: [0x00067F3A]
Italy. Same place they were holding you.

Id: [0x00067F3D]
Leave me be, Assassin!

Id: [0x00067F41]
I always knew it would come to this - just not so soon. I wonder if Abstergo even knows what's about to happen... And has this been part of their plan all along? Maybe they want the world to end. To see it all burned away. Then they'd have their new world - ripe for the reshaping... We talked about looking for another power source. Leaving him there. That's probably what he'd want. For us to finish the mission. But I can't. It's hard enough taking a life - but letting one be taken... knowing there was something I could do about it. Not a chance. Might be I'm risking my life - risking all our lives to save an asshole. But what else am I supposed to do? That asshole is my dad.

Id: [0x00067F44]
What are you two waiting for? Let's go.

Id: [0x00067F45]
There's more.

Id: [0x00067F49]
Hello again Mister Miles. I hope this message finds you well - or as well as it can, all things considered... It appears we now each have something the other desires. I propose a trade. Bring me the Apple and I'll return your father to you no worse for the wear. Should you refuse, he will still be returned, albeit much worse for the wear. I assume you'd like to avoid an unpleasant outcome.

Id: [0x00067F4D]
They're probably holding your father on the upper levels. Same place they kept you. There's an elevator bank down the hall. Try not to let them see you.

Id: [0x00067F4E]
They know I'm here, Rebecca. There's no way they don't.

Id: [0x00067F4F]
This, this was a bad idea.

Id: [0x00067F52]
Fourth floor.

Id: [0x00067F55]
Well, I see you've learned absolutely nothing since you left us. Walking into an elevator in the middle of a hostile environment. Really?

Id: [0x00067F56]
Where's my father?

Id: [0x00067F57]
[laugh]You'll see him soon enough. Now be a good boy and wait for security to fetch you.

Id: [0x00067F60]
Hand over your weapons and come with me, sir.

Id: [0x00067F61]
I can show myself in, but thanks for the offer.

Id: [0x00067F63]
I'd rather this not turn ugly, Mister Miles.

Id: [0x00067F64]
Then let me through.

Id: [0x00067F65]
Subdue the subject, please.

Id: [0x00067F68]
You're gonna have to climb the rest of the way.

Id: [0x00068155]
Your dad could be anywhere, Desmond. I'm sorry but I just don't know where he is.

Id: [0x00068157]
That's okay. I do...

Id: [0x0006815D]
Give me the Apple.

Id: [0x00068179]
Away with you!

Id: [0x0006817B]
I am not the man you seek!

Id: [0x00068217]
That man. He thought what he was doing was right.

Id: [0x00068218]
He did. As do his brothers.

Id: [0x0006821B]
Who was he, really?

Id: [0x0006821C]
There are powerful organizations who seek control, nothing more. This man belonged to one.

Id: [0x0006821D]
It does not surprise me. I don't know who you are but if you should need my help, I am happy to give it.

Id: [0x00068233]
So easy? I'm disappointed, Assassin!

Id: [0x00068235]
Not so hard to outrun an Assassin.

Id: [0x00068237]
I expected failure from the likes of you!

Id: [0x0006823E]
Empty that purse.

Id: [0x00068240]
Gimme all your coin. You know how this works.

Id: [0x00068242]
Pay up. 'Fore I sock you one.

Id: [0x00068245]
Gawd. He won't be troubling me any longer. Thank you, mister. Was kinda getting used to being robbed by these brutes, sadly enough.

Id: [0x00068248]
Gonna to tell us what we want to know? Or yous comfortable in there?

Id: [0x00068249]
Maybe we should make it a little less Comfortable. The boss is getting impatient.

Id: [0x0006824C]
Come on! Hit!

Id: [0x0006824D]
I'll give ya a real shot.

Id: [0x0006824F]
How's it?

Id: [0x00068250]
Quiet.

Id: [0x00068251]
Haven't used the whip in what- an hour? About time we warm it up again, I'd say.

Id: [0x00068253]
Much obliged, sir!

Id: [0x00068257]
Let's not draw this out. You've got nowhere to go and I've got a gun.

Id: [0x00068259]
Speaking of which... It's the 21st century and you're still running around with only a tiny knife for protection? It's stupid.

Id: [0x0006825C]
Alright Desmond. Game's over.

Id: [0x00068260]
Not now... Not...now....

Id: [0x00068263]
[–ú–µ–Ω—è –µ—â–µ –∂–¥–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞.]There is still work to be done.

Id: [0x00068265]
Niet! (No!) Get out!

Id: [0x00068267]
What the hell was that?

Id: [0x0006826A]
You need to stop him, Desmond!

Id: [0x0006826C]
What the hell is going on down there?!

Id: [0x0006826D]
Goddamit Cross! You've really made a mess of things!

Id: [0x00068270]
[freaking out]Get out! Get ouut! Get ouuuut![screams]

Id: [0x00068273]
Enough is enough Mister Miles. I invited you here in the spirit of cooperation. But you've responded to my hospitality with only violence. I had hoped we might preserve you and further study your memories. But you're not worth the trouble.

Id: [0x00068275]
I hereby authorize the use of deadly force. Kill the bastard! And then bring me the Apple!

Id: [0x00068278]
I gotta fight this...

Id: [0x0006827A]
Not now...

Id: [0x0006827C]
Everything... changing...

Id: [0x0006827E]
Need...to...push...back...

Id: [0x00068280]
[Sound of pain]

Id: [0x00068283]
All the voices in my head. Screaming. Screaming... all the time. Begging to be released. But this is my body.  MY mind. They lived their lives. Why don't they let me live mine? You have to silence them. Please. [–±—É–¥—å—Ç–µ –¥–æ–±—Ä—ã]Please. Please. Silence them.

Id: [0x00068285]
Let me rest in peace. [pain from stab]

Id: [0x00068287]
Where's Vidic?

Id: [0x00068288]
Fifth floor.

Id: [0x0006828A]
Vidic's office is up ahead.

Id: [0x0006828D]
Good to be kings, eh?!

Id: [0x0006828F]
Look at these louts. Pathetic, they is.

Id: [0x00068291]
GET outa the way, now.

Id: [0x00068293]
You got my money?

Id: [0x00068294]
I don't even know you.

Id: [0x00068295]
Name's Mitt. Now you know me. Got my money?

Id: [0x00068296]
I don't...please...

Id: [0x00068299]
Somebody should make an example of that lot. Lynch the tonies for all to see.

Id: [0x0006829B]
You was supposed to deliver somthin' to us today. Where you been?

Id: [0x0006829C]
Come on now. I emptied my cart to you last week. I've nothing left.

Id: [0x0006829D]
Not my problem. You best fill us up tomorrow or you'll wish you had.

Id: [0x0006829F]
Jaysus! Who was that?!

Id: [0x000682A0]
Let's get outa here.

Id: [0x000682A2]
You... You killed him...

Id: [0x000682A3]
Daniel was like a son to me... A sickly son, perhaps... But one full of promise...

Id: [0x000682A4]
He accomplished so much... and so well.

Id: [0x000682A5]
And now you've taken him from me! From us!

Id: [0x000682A6]
Like the Apple. Like Lucy.

Id: [0x000682A7]
We want to help the world, Desmond. To save it from itself! But you keep getting in the way. All our hard work, ruined.

Id: [0x000682A8]
You're a fanatic. All your kind. Maintaining the erroneous belief that WE are evil. That the work WE do is wrong.

Id: [0x000682A9]
We ENRICH lives here. We SAVE and TRANSFORM them.

Id: [0x000682AF]
So you're the lad. Neighborhood could use more men of action like yourself.

Id: [0x000682B0]
My name is Connor.

Id: [0x000682B1]
That's a lovely name for a man from Wales. What is your REAL name?

Id: [0x000682B2]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton...

Id: [0x000682BA]
But only one. I suspect they made camp and things remained peaceful for a time, then greed bore its ugly teeth. A fight broke out between them. Vicious, one of the men drawing a blade and stabbing the other. Then he set out for home. But he received justice of a kind before long, as he was attacked and killed by a wolf. I am sorry to be the one to bring you this tale.

Id: [0x000682D0]
But you... You just keep taking and taking what isn't yours!

Id: [0x000682D1]
Dad!

Id: [0x000682D4]
Not so fast, Mister Miles. In case you hadn't noticed, I'm the one calling the shots.

Id: [0x000682D6]
Now give me the Apple.

Id: [0x000682DA]
Wait. No.

Id: [0x000682E7]
You never should have come here. You put everything on the line - for, what? So you could rescue your father?

Id: [0x000682EA]
Yeah.

Id: [0x000682EC]
About time we did something about those brutes. I want in.

Id: [0x000682ED]
Good on ya! That's one for the lads. Come on, let's gather the rest.

Id: [0x000682F4]
Bar's closed. Get out!

Id: [0x0006830E]
The leader spoke too quick but I gathered we was poachin', havin' crossed into their territory a month or so hence. Their musket barrels stared us down- the heads of their arrows smilin' sharp at our backs. I bumbled a proposition in busted Shawnee: our full piece- my three bales and my partner's two less a half- in exchange for us quittin' the Shawnee bush on our own legs.

Id: [0x0006830F]
Leader nods to his boys. They load up our take and start back into the trees. The honcho stays a spell longer just starin'. Starin' right through us with his two black eyes. And then he was gone. We picked up and set back east the way we came- months of profit lost but our own hides intact. Never saw the Shawnee again but I know they was followin' us. I Could feel their eyes on our backs clear to North Carolina...

Id: [0x00068346]
...local utility companies have assured the public that they're completely prepared for the upcoming solar maximum. Disruptions to service are expected to be minimal...

Id: [0x00068349]
If only they knew...

Id: [0x0006834B]
What's this?

Id: [0x0006834C]
A remote-operated camera. It'll provide us with a feed while you're on mission.

Id: [0x0006834E]
This will let us talk to each other.

Id: [0x00068352]
That one! Get him.

Id: [0x00068354]
There! Bring him down!

Id: [0x00068356]
On them!

Id: [0x00068359]
Show no mercy!

Id: [0x0006835B]
Curse you, Assassin.

Id: [0x0006835D]
Die!

Id: [0x0006835F]
Keep him off me!

Id: [0x00068361]
Back! Back!

Id: [0x00068362]
Oh, that's a... Hold still.  That's a lovely view!

Id: [0x00068363]
Seriously Shaun, fuck you.

Id: [0x00068370]
He was a Templar.

Id: [0x00068371]
What like the KNIGHTS Templar? Jesus, I thought they were a spook story.

Id: [0x00068372]
They are very real.

Id: [0x00068373]
I'll take your word for it, lad. Well, it's been a real pleasure. If you ever need a hand in a.. whatever it is you're up to, I'm your man.

Id: [0x00068376]
And on the not-so-bright side, the slightest misstep means you're effectively... paste.

Id: [0x00068379]
You've made a sound choice. King George's Regulars are the most respected soldiers in the world. Decent pay and three meals a day. Plus you'll be doing your part for the empire, you will. Lets a man sleep easy at night knowing he's serving his country.

Id: [0x0006837B]
Piss off. This is military business.

Id: [0x0006837D]
Keep your distance.

Id: [0x0006837F]
Shove off or get a musket butt in your gut.

Id: [0x00068382]
I didn't sign up for nothin'! Yous forced me into this! Don't wanna fight no war for nobody.

Id: [0x00068383]
Nonsense, boy. You signed the contract in your own hand. That's as binding a commitment as there is.

Id: [0x00068387]
Let's go, now. Keep up.

Id: [0x00068389]
Thanks mister! You've a kind heart! I'm goin' home!

Id: [0x0006838C]
Somebody stop that man!

Id: [0x0006838E]
Minerva...?

Id: [0x00068390]
If you heed Minerva the sun will have its way.

Id: [0x00068391]
The ground will crack and spit fire into the sky. All the world will burn.

Id: [0x00068393]
But this does not end the world, merely heralds its arrival. Darkness follows.

Id: [0x00068394]
Then you emerge...Resolving to lay a foundation that such a tragedy does not befall the world again.

Id: [0x00068395]
You will become a symbol to those who survive. Hope. Knowledge. Determination. You will inspire them to rebuild. To thrive once more. And as the world heals, so too will humanity...

Id: [0x00068397]
But you are just a man. Frail and mortal. You pass from the world, leaving behind only a memory. A... legacy.

Id: [0x00068399]
You will be remembered first as a hero. Later as a legend. And in time... As a god.

Id: [0x0006839A]
It is the cruelest fate. To have written words that meant well - and see them made wicked and unwise. What was meant to encourage life - used instead to justify taking it!

Id: [0x0006839D]
Yes... Come...

Id: [0x000683A3]
Here... at last.

Id: [0x000683A6]
You know our story now. Of how we tried. Of how we failed.

Id: [0x000683A8]
All our hopes extinguished...

Id: [0x000683AA]
Save one.

Id: [0x000683AC]
Your touch, a spark. A spark to save the world.

Id: [0x000683B1]
Wait!

Id: [0x000683B3]
Do not touch the pedestal!

Id: [0x000683B4]
You... But how?

Id: [0x000683B6]
You left! You destroyed the device!

Id: [0x000683B7]
Did you think there was only one?

Id: [0x000683B9]
What the hell is going on here?

Id: [0x000683BB]
You must not free her!

Id: [0x000683BC]
Free her?

Id: [0x000683BD]
Juno dwells within these walls, awaiting release.

Id: [0x000683BF]
I will explain.

Id: [0x000683C1]
While we worked to save the world, she sought, instead, to conquer it.

Id: [0x000683C3]
She used our machines to set her plans in motion.

Id: [0x000683C5]
Divination through numbers. There is a pattern to existence. To comprehend the calculations is to tame time. This was my focus. And so I built the eye to aid us.

Id: [0x000683C7]
But she turned it towards her own ends.

Id: [0x000683CA]
When we discovered her treachery, we put a stop to it.

Id: [0x000683CC]
And then we left. But first we called to you... That you might try again. We thought it would be safe with her gone.

Id: [0x000683D0]
Now I see we were deceived.

Id: [0x000683D3]
She survived. She endured.

Id: [0x000683D5]
And then she began to work...

Id: [0x000683D7]
For centuries Tinia and I walked the world, hoping to rekindle the spark of civilization. We shared what we knew as best we could.

Id: [0x000683D9]
We were not the only ones.

Id: [0x000683DB]
But for all the power we wrought, still death would claim us. But before it did, I would have one last look to know if we had succeeded.

Id: [0x000683DC]
That's how you're here now?

Id: [0x000683E0]
I had hoped you might find this place - and finish our work. But it is too late. You and the Templars have squabbled over our refuse. You have wasted centuries. And so you have lost your chance.

Id: [0x000683E2]
You cannot hope to stop the end now, Desmond. Only to survive it.

Id: [0x000683E4]
She's lying! Only touch the pedestal and the world WILL be saved.

Id: [0x000683E5]
Better the world burn than she be loosed upon it.

Id: [0x000683E6]
Is that so?

Id: [0x000683E8]
Show him, then.

Id: [0x000683E9]
But he will not understand.

Id: [0x000683EB]
Show me.

Id: [0x000683EC]
It is complicated... It is...

Id: [0x000683F7]
So tell me: How is this better?

Id: [0x000683FB]
She would sacrifice you - sacrifice the WORLD - for no other reason than to deny me vindication.

Id: [0x000683FC]
They will enslave your kind, Desmond. Is this not why you fight? Is this not why you came here? To ensure more than just your race's future, but its freedom?

Id: [0x000683FE]
What future? What freedom? Billions dead and the whole cycle begun anew? This world has known nothing but heartache and horror since we left it.

Id: [0x000683FF]
Our gift to them. And you'd see it all returned.

Id: [0x00068402]
ENOUGH!

Id: [0x00068407]
You must not do this...

Id: [0x0006840A]
Whatever Juno's planning - however terrible it might seem today - we'll find a way to stop it. But the alternative, what you want...  There's no hope there.

Id: [0x0006840B]
If you free her - you'll be destroyed.

Id: [0x0006840D]
It will happen in an instant. There will be no pain.

Id: [0x0006840F]
You mustn't!

Id: [0x00068410]
It's done, Minerva. The decision's made.

Id: [0x00068412]
Then the consequences of this mistake are yours to live - and die - with.

Id: [0x00068415]
You need to go. All of you. Now. Get as far away from here as you can.

Id: [0x00068416]
Come with us. We'll find another way.

Id: [0x00068417]
There isn't time!

Id: [0x00068419]
Son...

Id: [0x0006841B]
You know it's true. It's already started. I need to do this now. So go!

Id: [0x00068425]
...it's some sort of global aurora borealis...

Id: [0x00068427]
...never seen anything like this before...

Id: [0x00068429]
...eyewitnesses describe electrical storms and erratic displays of unusual weather[static]... residents being asked to remain INSIDE and wait for... [static]

Id: [0x0006842C]
...geological surveys are now reporting seismic activity throughout the ring of fire... northeastern Canada is said to be experiencing the largest... [static]on record...

Id: [0x0006842F]
...satellites and transformers are failing as the flare increases in intensity... Worldwide reports of blackouts and[burst of static]...

Id: [0x00068438]
It is done. The world is saved.

Id: [0x0006843D]
You played your part well, Desmond.

Id: [0x0006843F]
But now...

Id: [0x00068441]
Now it's time that I played mine.

Id: [0x00068451]
Halt! In the name of the King!

Id: [0x00068453]
Stop! Stop!

Id: [0x00068455]
He's not old 'nough to go to war. Anyway, I don't know where he is!

Id: [0x00068456]
We saw your son this morning. So we know he's round somewhere. And he is a strapping young chap. Built for soldiering.

Id: [0x00068457]
I'll be sure to tell him of your high opinion but he took off this mornin'. Dunno where to.

Id: [0x00068458]
Does your son leave without telling where he's going often, Madam? Sounds like he needs a little discipline- something he'd learn in his Majesty's service.

Id: [0x0006845A]
Anything boys?

Id: [0x0006845B]
Nah!

Id: [0x0006845C]
Keep looking. He's here somewhere.

Id: [0x0006845E]
Pst. Mister. These lobsterbacks are trying to sign me up for the army. I don't want to fight no war for nobody. I'm only eleven and half! Can you help me get to that cart so I can get out of here?

Id: [0x00068461]
Get your hands off me!

Id: [0x00068462]
Calm down.

Id: [0x00068464]
Get out of here. Not your business.

Id: [0x00068466]
Piss off. This is not your concern.

Id: [0x00068468]
This is a military matter. No concern of yours.

Id: [0x0006846B]
You saved my life, mister. Me mum and I are grateful.

Id: [0x0006846D]
Don't mean to bother you but I couldn't help but notice what you done. Real good of you.

Id: [0x0006846E]
What is happening here?

Id: [0x0006846F]
Regulars have taken to conscribing the young ones 'round here. It's not right. I was thinking that maybe we could do some good together- if you had the time.

Id: [0x00068472]
What would you have me do?

Id: [0x00068473]
More of the same, actually. I got a plan cooking but the folks need to know they've got someone to turn to. Find me when you're done.

Id: [0x00068476]
Welcome to the Regulars. The most feared, respected and revered fighting force on God's green earth. Some of you are here by choice, others not. Regardless of the circumstances of your joining us, you are all brothers now. And the only way you have a chance of surviving is if you trust your brothers. One weak link can kill a whole squad on the field. I want you to think about that long and hard.

Id: [0x00068477]
That's one of them that's responsible for this- rounding up the young ones and shipping them off. We need to put an end to it.

Id: [0x00068478]
What is your plan?

Id: [0x00068479]
Kill him, then the rest and set all them boys free?

Id: [0x0006847D]
It's a good plan but it lacks detail. How is your aim with that rifle?

Id: [0x0006847E]
Can pop a muskrat's head from a quarter mile nine times outa ten- and the ten's a misfire.

Id: [0x0006847F]
That should do. Cover me from up there.

Id: [0x0006848F]
A lot of you will be getting on that ship and setting off for a different sort of training. Understand!? You've been selected, not for your talents or fighting prowess but because of the way you think. You will soon find out what all this means but KNOW it is a great honor. Some of you won't make it. Others will rise to new heights. Either way you will give your life to a new cause.

Id: [0x000684A3]
You really think we'll finally get some answers down here?

Id: [0x000684A4]
Maybe. Talking to the first civ has always been a pain in the ass though.

Id: [0x000684A6]
Imagine what it must be like for them.

Id: [0x000684A7]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000684A8]
They've been separated from us by tens of thousands of years - A completely different language and culture...possessed of an intelligence vastly superior to our own. We're lucky they've communicated as much as they have.

Id: [0x000684A9]
I don't know why they had to make this all so complicated. I mean, if they need something from me, they should just come out and say it.

Id: [0x000684AA]
I've been wondering about that myself. I get the sense Juno and Minerva didn't exactly see eye to eye. I'm studying everything I can get my hands on... But maybe you'll find something down here that can shed light on the mystery. What happened between them - and why?

Id: [0x000684AD]
What do you think's behind that door?

Id: [0x000684AE]
No idea.

Id: [0x000684AF]
Do you think it can save us?

Id: [0x000684B0]
The first civ seemed to think so.

Id: [0x000684B1]
What if it's dangerous?

Id: [0x000684B2]
It's not like we have a lot of alternatives.

Id: [0x000684B3]
Well we could... I don't know... warn the President?

Id: [0x000684B4]
And what's he gonna to do? And who's to say he isn't in bed with Abstergo? Seems everyone is these days...

Id: [0x000684B5]
What if we went to them? To Abstergo, I mean.

Id: [0x000684B6]
I thought about it, actually. Showing them what we've seen. Trying to work together... They must know so much more than we do. But...

Id: [0x000684B7]
What is it?

Id: [0x000684B8]
It's possible they know exactly what's going to happen. That they WANT it to happen. For all we know they're hiding out in bunkers right now, waiting for the world to end. And then, when it's all over - out they come - ready to take control.

Id: [0x000684B9]
God I hope you're wrong.

Id: [0x000684BA]
Hello Desmond. How's things?

Id: [0x000684BB]
Same old. Another day another ancestor.

Id: [0x000684BC]
Who'd have thought you'd have a Templar in your family tree.

Id: [0x000684BD]
I think he started out as an Assassin. They must have turned him...

Id: [0x000684BE]
Right you are, in fact! I've been reviewing our archives and it appears that Haytham's father was indeed an Assassin. Which means he was likely one too. At least for a little while...

Id: [0x000684BF]
What else did you find?

Id: [0x000684C0]
That fellow from the opera - Reginald Birch - Grand Master of the London chapter of Templars. He and Haytham's father - a man named Edward - well, they were long time rivals. Now, it appears Birch got his hands on Haytham at a rather young age - worked his wiles to convince Haytham to switch sides. Wonder how he did it. I'll see if I can't dig up more...

Id: [0x000684C2]
Hon-, honest answer please Desmond: Do you think we're getting out of this alive?

Id: [0x000684C3]
I don't know... I mean - it's a pretty tall order. If the first civ couldn't save the world - how the hell are we supposed to swing it?

Id: [0x000684C4]
We have some time.

Id: [0x000684C5]
We have less than two months. They had decades and a lot more resources. And the worst part... is we knew this was coming for, what, hundreds of years?

Id: [0x000684C6]
History repeats, it seems. The first civ was so busy with their war against us - no one even noticed what was happening. We get advance warning, and then fall to fighting with the Templars... Lovely.

Id: [0x000684C7]
Hopefully whatever's behind that door will make a difference.

Id: [0x000684C9]
And if it doesn't - well, at least we tried...

Id: [0x000684CA]
Yes?

Id: [0x000684CB]
Just thought I'd you know, say hi?

Id: [0x000684CC]
You have more important things to do right now.

Id: [0x000684CD]
Jesus dad...

Id: [0x000684CE]
What? What do you want me to say?

Id: [0x000684CF]
I don't know... Hi son? How are you? What have you been up to?

Id: [0x000684D0]
I know what you've been up to. Nothing. You wasted away in some shitty apartment with a pointless job while the rest of us were out there fighting to make a difference.

Id: [0x000684D1]
You are SUCH an asshole.

Id: [0x000684D3]
Oh, you thinking about hitting me again? Because this time I will hit back.

Id: [0x000684D4]
Let's just get back to work, okay?

Id: [0x000684D6]
Stop wasting time.

Id: [0x000684D8]
Clock's ticking, Desmond...

Id: [0x000684DA]
Come on son, we've got work to do...

Id: [0x000684E9]
I know where the key is.

Id: [0x000684EA]
Then let's go.

Id: [0x000684F6]
Moment of truth.

Id: [0x000684F9]
And so now you see... That what was shall be again.

Id: [0x000684FC]
GO!

Id: [0x00068501]
Fascinating...

Id: [0x00068503]
I'm tired of it. All The cryptic warnings. The threats.

Id: [0x00068504]
But they are... "We saw the Nephilim there. We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them." Imagine trying to explain all of this to a two year old. To a grasshopper. When they said the will of the gods was unknowable - they meant it. Literally.

Id: [0x00068506]
I killed her, you know. I killed Lucy.

Id: [0x00068507]
It was the Apple, son. It was Juno.

Id: [0x00068508]
I saw what she was. What would happen if I let her live. I could have stopped myself. I mean... there was a force there. But I didn't have to. I CHOSE to.

Id: [0x0006850B]
Desmond...

Id: [0x0006850C]
Lucy was going to betray us and take the Apple back to Abstergo. I saw the satellite launched. I saw them turn it on. And then... It failed...

Id: [0x00068510]
Whatever's on the other side of that door - it benefits Juno. We need to be careful.

Id: [0x00068518]
Hey Desmond. Didn't Subject Sixteen's -

Id: [0x00068519]
His name was Clay.

Id: [0x0006851A]
Sorry. Didn't Clay say Washington was a Templar?

Id: [0x0006851B]
No. He indicated that Washington came into contact with an Apple of Eden. But beyond that it's all speculation. Furthermore, judging from the portrait referenced by Clay, the event occurred much later in Washington's life. Perhaps Connor wasn't even involved. It's very hard to know for sure. We'll just have to wait and see what - if anything - happens.

Id: [0x00068529]
I'm telling you, there's something down here...

Id: [0x0006852A]
Don't be daft.

Id: [0x0006852B]
I don't know... Maybe they were sleeping or something and we woke them. Some kind of... cryogenics. Or hibernation. I mean, how do we know what the hell they were doing down here?

Id: [0x00068530]
They were working on a bunch of different solutions. But nothing worked. Just went from one to the next. And then [a beat]I don't know. They must have left at some point. After the end...

Id: [0x00068532]
I wonder what the world would be like if they'd succeeded...

Id: [0x00068533]
I'm more concerned about what it'll be like if we don't.

Id: [0x00068538]
...salvation...they found a way...too late for them...but not for you...sealed...to protect it...though now it bars your way...find the key...the past will tell...

Id: [0x0006853D]
I can't believe it's taken me so long to ask, but - how's mom. She's not...

Id: [0x0006853F]
No, no. Your mother's fine. We decided it was safer if we split up for this job.

Id: [0x00068540]
Always assuming the worst.

Id: [0x00068541]
Hum. For good reason.

Id: [0x00068542]
Can I at least say hi to her?

Id: [0x00068544]
I'm sorry... it's too risky. Maybe when we're done...

Id: [0x00068545]
Right. When we're done.

Id: [0x00068547]
Son?

Id: [0x00068549]
I... I owe you an apology. I shouldn't have lashed out like that.

Id: [0x0006854C]
You have to understand I've never been very good at this. Nevermind that we live rather... extraordinary lives.

Id: [0x0006854D]
Yeah... I kinda liked my ordinary one.

Id: [0x0006854E]
You can't escape who you are Desmond.

Id: [0x0006854F]
So I've noticed.

Id: [0x00068553]
Look... It's silly for us to go back and forth like this. I admit, I did a shitty job raising you. I apologize. I'm sorry. But it's important you understand it didn't come from a bad place. You're my son. I love you.

Id: [0x00068555]
I guess I was so busy trying to make sure nothing bad happened. I didn't... consider the consequences.

Id: [0x00068557]
Truce?

Id: [0x0006857A]
I know everyone thinks I'm being silly, but I can't shake the feeling we're being watched.

Id: [0x0006857B]
We are being watched. By Juno. Or some version of her.

Id: [0x0006857C]
Do you think it's a recording? Or is she a ghost? Or... something else? Is she talking to us the way Minerva talked to Ezio?

Id: [0x0006857D]
No clue. Mean who knows what else they were working on down here. There are still so many rooms we don't have access to...

Id: [0x0006857F]
But... do you think she's like literally down here. Waiting, somewhere? Still alive?

Id: [0x00068580]
Still alive, that's mental! That would mean she'd be at least - 75? 80 thousand years old? They were powerful, yeah - but not that powerful.

Id: [0x00068581]
They came down here looking for a way to survive... Maybe they found one?

Id: [0x00068583]
Was it weird seeing Cross?

Id: [0x00068584]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00068585]
It's different for you. You don't know about what happened, I guess. For a long time he was... important to us. He was a different person.

Id: [0x00068586]
Shaun said he was a sleeper agent. Like Lucy.

Id: [0x00068587]
It was different. She made a choice. But Cross... if you read the files... Abstergo just... they - they did terrible things to him.

Id: [0x00068588]
Rebecca?

Id: [0x00068589]
You're lucky. We all are. We have people who care about us. Who look out for us. He was all alone - and the people he thought he could trust, they used him.

Id: [0x0006858A]
Did you know him?

Id: [0x0006858B]
No... But... I knew Hannah.

Id: [0x0006858C]
Who's that?

Id: [0x0006858D]
She tried to help him. She trusted him. But there was a raid about a year ago... She stayed behind so the others could escape. Tried to reason with him. To see if she could fix things...

Id: [0x0006858E]
What happened?

Id: [0x0006858F]
What do you think happened? He killed her. That's what he does. That's all he knows how to do. Sometimes it seems like that's all any of us know how to do...

Id: [0x00068591]
Rebecca...

Id: [0x00068595]
I just want to be alone right now...

Id: [0x0006859B]
Have... Have we ever tried to make peace with the Templars?

Id: [0x0006859C]
Throughout our history there have been moments... Several, in fact. But...

Id: [0x0006859E]
It's impossible. There are... existential differences. Insurmountable. If there were to be unity, it wouldn't be a truce so much as a submission.

Id: [0x0006859F]
But knowing what's about to happen... Wouldn't it make sense to try and talk to Vidic? Come to an arrangement? Even if it's only temporary?

Id: [0x000685A0]
We'd all be so busy watching our backs, nothing would get accomplished. Imagine that. We're more productive at war...

Id: [0x000685A1]
Well have we ever tried... sending in someone? Doing to them what they did to us with Lucy? Or Cross?

Id: [0x000685A2]
We have. And it's never worked. We've sent people who were either too weak, and found themselves turned - or too strong, and were unable to carry out the charade.

Id: [0x000685A3]
I just feel like we all want the same thing.

Id: [0x000685A4]
We use the same words, but that's all they are... words. In the end it all comes down to freedom. We seek it. They detest it. And so there's never an end to the fight. Not until one side is completely gone.

Id: [0x000685A5]
Is that even possible?

Id: [0x000685A6]
Probably not. Our two groups have existed in one form or another since... well... forever. But things can be better than they are. And that's something.

Id: [0x000685A8]
Did you look for me, dad? When I was gone.

Id: [0x000685A9]
Every day.

Id: [0x000685AA]
Come on...

Id: [0x000685AB]
I mean it. Every night I'd look. Searching for your name - or variations of it - hoping you'd slip up. Abstergo only found you first because they had better access. A few more days and it would have been me.

Id: [0x000685AC]
Well, I'm here now.

Id: [0x000685AD]
And I'm glad.

Id: [0x000685AF]
Do you think Lucy regretted what she was doing?

Id: [0x000685B0]
I used to think I knew her well, but clearly that wasn't the case. So I really can't give you an honest answer.

Id: [0x000685B1]
She seemed so sincere, though. Like she really wanted to make a difference.

Id: [0x000685B2]
Yes, well when I first met him, I thought the same thing about Cross.

Id: [0x000685B3]
It just keeps happening over and over again.

Id: [0x000685B4]
What does?

Id: [0x000685B6]
Everything...

Id: [0x000685B7]
Don't get weird on me, Desmond.

Id: [0x000685B8]
No. It's fine. I'm fine. Don't worry.

Id: [0x000685B9]
Alright, then. You should think about getting back in the Animus... We've got to find that key.

Id: [0x00068615]
Oh Desmond, there you are! Can I ask a favor?

Id: [0x00068616]
Maybe...

Id: [0x00068617]
When this is all over, I'd like to try turning the dial back on the Animus. Like ALL the way back. To the time of the first civilization.

Id: [0x00068618]
You think it would work?

Id: [0x00068619]
There was no real loss of fidelity when you visited Alta√Ør. Then again, that was about a thousand years ago and I'm looking at going back at least seventy thousand more.

Id: [0x0006861A]
Sure. I'd be up for it. Would be interesting to see what things were like back then.

Id: [0x0006861B]
Excellent! I think it would prove most enlightening.

Id: [0x0006861D]
So this is how it started...

Id: [0x0006861E]
What are you up to?

Id: [0x0006861F]
Just brushing up on my American history, I... I say history. They certainly teach you strange things in the states.

Id: [0x00068620]
Like what?

Id: [0x00068621]
Well - for all the talk of this being a "revolutionary" war. It was a civil one. Well, not THAT kind of civil. I mean there was no America versus Britain. It was Brit on Brit action. And you can clearly see how the whole thing got started: one war gave birth to the other.

Id: [0x00068622]
You mean the Seven Years War?

Id: [0x00068623]
Exactly. Seems the crown overspent in its attempt to keep the French out. Wound up with a great deal of debt. Believing that the colonists should help to shoulder the burden, new taxes were created. It was a reasonable request - even if parliament was rather well, undiplomatic about it.

Id: [0x00068624]
It's not really fair to tax people for a war they didn't want any part of...

Id: [0x00068625]
What?! Didn't want any part of? Did you not notice George Washington with Edward Braddock? He was right there in the middle of it! So here you have the Crown spending who knows how much money to secure a place for the colonists to thrive - and then when they ask for a little bit of help...

Id: [0x00068627]
Right, look think of it this way. King George and the colonists they all go out to dinner, right. And when the bill comes, George asks for them to kick in and pay their share.  Fair enough!  But keep in mind he's been taking them out to dinner gratis for DECADES now. But the colonists, oh no, they insist they only had a glass of water and a side salad. Nevermind the table is FULL of half-eaten food and empty bottles of wine. And then when the King points this out, what do the colonists do?  Oh! They flip the table over and they storm out of the restaurant - probably intending to return later and burn it down.

Id: [0x00068628]
You left out the part where the king pointed a GUN at the colonists and asked them to cover dinner for EVERYONE in the restaurant.

Id: [0x00068629]
Riiiight. Right, yeah.  Interesting take.  IF he pulled out a gun - and I'm not sure he did - it would only have been after the hundredth failed attempt at getting them to pay their fair share.

Id: [0x0006862A]
But how do you define someone's fair share?

Id: [0x0006862B]
With a war, apparently.

Id: [0x0006862D]
I wonder how many other places like this exist...

Id: [0x0006862E]
There are dozens of them. All over the world.

Id: [0x0006862F]
And somehow no one's ever found one before us?

Id: [0x00068630]
I don't think that's true.

Id: [0x00068631]
Oh?

Id: [0x00068632]
When I was at Abstergo, Vidic talked about silencing discoveries made by non-Templars. And I'm sure Abstergo has dug up plenty.

Id: [0x00068633]
The things they must know...

Id: [0x00068634]
Regretting throwing in with us?

Id: [0x00068635]
Hah. No. Just looking forward to when we can finally trounce those bastards so I can dive into their archives.

Id: [0x00068646]
We Assassins strive for peace through freedom. And The Templars- they want only to control.

Id: [0x00068647]
Well, I'm for freedom, I know that much. If your Order needs a good rifle, sign me up.

Id: [0x0006864E]
Bring him out.

Id: [0x00068650]
Everything alright?

Id: [0x00068651]
Shaun has located a second power source. I've asked Rebecca to charter a flight for us.

Id: [0x00068652]
Where to?

Id: [0x00068653]
Brazil.

Id: [0x00068657]
We can get back to Connor whenever you're ready, Desmond... Unless you want to plug in the power source first? Up to you!

Id: [0x00068659]
I wonder what stories the temple will tell me today...

Id: [0x0006865C]
Already?

Id: [0x0006865D]
It popped up in an earlier search, but I've only just managed to confirm it.

Id: [0x0006865E]
Where?

Id: [0x0006865F]
There's a museum in Cairo with one on display.

Id: [0x00068670]
[cough]

Id: [0x00068672]
[sick moan]

Id: [0x00068674]
Another stricken with the sickness. Are you aware you just carried a man infected with smallpox?

Id: [0x00068675]
Yes. I had the illness when I was a child.

Id: [0x00068676]
Immune then. Perhaps you could help out. People have been sharing blankets infected with the disease. They need to be burned.

Id: [0x0006867C]
At least you're no beast like most of these 'people'. Anybody who's immune has already fled. Cowards.

Id: [0x0006867D]
And who are you?

Id: [0x0006867E]
Jamie Colley. You need to keep doing what you're doing. Nobody else is. If we both get after it we might be able to quell this monster of a disease.

Id: [0x0006867F]
I will do what I can.

Id: [0x00068680]
I'll be lending a hand to these doctors. Find me once you think you've done enough and maybe we can do more.

Id: [0x00068683]
What you doin' burnin' my blanket!?

Id: [0x00068685]
Your blankets are infected with smallpox. You should get to the doctor right away.

Id: [0x00068686]
Oh that's just great.

Id: [0x00068689]
Why you gotta go off and do that?! Blankets ain't cheap!

Id: [0x0006868A]
This blanket has the pox in it. You need to see a doctor as soon as possible.

Id: [0x0006868B]
Ah, hell.

Id: [0x0006868D]
We need to distribute these blankets soon.

Id: [0x0006868F]
Good riddance to these beggars. The city's better off without them.

Id: [0x00068690]
Did you rub them proper?

Id: [0x00068691]
Yes. Never fear. They are coated in the disease.

Id: [0x00068692]
Good. Let's hurry, these corpses are ripening quick.

Id: [0x00068695]
First we knew hope - when we tried to combat the coming of the end...

Id: [0x00068696]
Then there was fear - when we began to doubt we would succeed...

Id: [0x00068697]
And finally there was resignation - when we knew the world would end...

Id: [0x00068698]
In these places we sought then, not to save, but to abide...

Id: [0x00068699]
Here you will meet the children of despair...

Id: [0x0006869B]
A new world approached. One that was dark and cold. It would consume us. For we were flesh and flesh is frail.

Id: [0x0006869D]
Though suits and shields might offer comfort - such adornments would not suffice... Not to save us all...

Id: [0x0006869F]
So we sought to change what we were. In this manner we might thrive in a world made poisonous...

Id: [0x000686A1]
It was Aita who volunteered to see if it might be done. Aita, my husband, my love.

Id: [0x000686A3]
In the end it changed him... Ruined him... He was made a prisoner of the machines. The body might survive - but his mind became brittle to the touch...

Id: [0x000686A5]
He begged me for release. For days - for weeks - for months. I pleaded with him to give us time to find another way.

Id: [0x000686A7]
But there wasn't one. Not for him. Not for us...

Id: [0x000686AB]
What is consciousness but a series of electrical impulses...

Id: [0x000686AD]
And the body a vessel to hold these sparks.

Id: [0x000686AF]
But it is weak. In time, it decays and crumbles into dust...

Id: [0x000686B1]
We asked ourselves, then: what if it might be replaced -

Id: [0x000686B3]
- with something stronger. Something better.

Id: [0x000686B5]
So we forged a new vessel. One that might endure. It proved easy enough to enter...

Id: [0x000686BB]
But to leave... To leave required something more... Something wrong...

Id: [0x000686BD]
And so this too they abandoned...

Id: [0x000686BF]
I wondered, though... were they right to turn away...

Id: [0x000686CA]
So what's the latest? Learn anything interesting while you were exploring?

Id: [0x000686CB]
They were working on some weird stuff towards the end. Trying to engineer new bodies and store their minds inside computers.

Id: [0x000686CC]
Failure after failure. It must have been hard for them...

Id: [0x000686CD]
I worry about it too. I mean - they say there's something in here that'll help us. But what is it? Why is it locked up if it's exactly what we need?

Id: [0x000686CE]
I don't know... Maybe it's dangerous. Maybe they wanted to make sure only you could reach it.

Id: [0x000686CF]
That's the other question... what makes me so special?

Id: [0x000686D0]
I guess we'll know once we open the door.

Id: [0x000686D3]
Hey. I hope it's not uncomfortable for me to ask but... What happened with Lucy?

Id: [0x000686D4]
I don't know...

Id: [0x000686D5]
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

Id: [0x000686D6]
No - it's fine. I really don't know. I was talking to my dad about it. It's hard to say. I mean - Juno definitely took control. But I think I agreed to it on some level. I think I let her in. [a beat]No. That's not right... It wasn't her, not exactly. It was more like... a program. Does that sound weird? It showed me things.

Id: [0x000686D7]
What did you see?

Id: [0x000686D8]
That if I didn't stop Lucy, Abstergo would get the Apple and we'd all be dead.

Id: [0x000686D9]
I still don't understand why she turned on us...

Id: [0x000686DA]
I'm sure she thought she was doing the right thing.

Id: [0x000686E0]
The key... All that remains is the key... You must hurry... Find it...

Id: [0x000686E6]
Come on, come on. Take your blanket and shove off.

Id: [0x000686E8]
It's a gift from the Governor. Be bloody grateful.

Id: [0x000686EA]
Just take it and get on your way. [aside]Beggars.

Id: [0x000686EC]
Might you have a different one? A cleaner one?

Id: [0x000686ED]
No.

Id: [0x000686EE]
This blanket's filthy!

Id: [0x000686EF]
Enjoying your charity work, are you?

Id: [0x000686F1]
Piss off.

Id: [0x000686F3]
If you want a blanket, get in line. If not, move.

Id: [0x000686F5]
You shoulda got a blanket about ten years ago, now, eh? Lotta good it did you. Get outta here.

Id: [0x000686F7]
Need something, mate? I'd suggest moving along.

Id: [0x000686F9]
Pow-wow's in the north end, I'm told. Get out of my face.

Id: [0x000686FB]
Lookin' for trouble? Stick around here much longer and you'll find it.

Id: [0x000686FE]
Git! Git!

Id: [0x00068700]
Pst! Psssst! Get outa here ya filthy mongrel

Id: [0x00068702]
My gratitude, mister. Those dogs got the fever I reckon.

Id: [0x00068706]
About time you showed up.

Id: [0x00068707]
I mean to start my inoculations. It's the most effective way to prevent the disease.

Id: [0x0006870C]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0006870D]
Not a worry, a pity people are so damned stupid. Eh Connor?

Id: [0x00068738]
What's wrong with you?

Id: [0x0006873B]
An attack is coming. Are you ready for a fight?

Id: [0x0006873C]
Always. You tell me where you want me and I'll make sure not a single man gets through.

Id: [0x00068759]
And here I was thinking you were helping me. I must say, I'm honored. [beat]Huh. If you ever need my help again- don't hesitate.

Id: [0x00068762]
Anything?

Id: [0x00068763]
Nah.

Id: [0x00068765]
A strong name- you should use it. Mine's Duncan, plain as they come. If you've the time to spare, I'd urge you to keep on doing what you're doing, this infernal gang needs to be stopped.

Id: [0x00068766]
Ah! Connor! Your work precedes you! Now it's time to finish the job. I'm told this chap just materialized from the ether and nobody has the stones, to you know... challenge him. Until now. We need a gang, a gang of our own though - fight fire with fire.

Id: [0x0006876A]
Unbelievable...

Id: [0x0006876B]
What's up?

Id: [0x0006876C]
Your politicians are constantly referencing the founding fathers - and insisting they must have been in support of one thing or another. I have never seen such a blatant disregard for history.

Id: [0x0006876D]
That's just typical political propaganda.

Id: [0x0006876E]
It's also dishonest and delusional. How can anyone claim to know what these people wanted based off scraps of paper and wishful thinking?

Id: [0x0006876F]
They're looking for intent - what these men envisioned for our country and its future.

Id: [0x00068770]
Idealistic... and unlikely. I don't think most of your presidents and senators and judges care what the founders thought. They just want to know how they can bend old words to achieve modern goals. Who cares if they were deists or theists or wanted a central bank. Why do people need the validation? What should matter is what you - as an individual believe. And why you believe it. What? Are we so insecure that we have to find 18th century letters to validate our beliefs? Oh, look mom! A dead man agreed with me. Maybe. If you transpose the letters in his shopping list you can plainly see he was on my side!

Id: [0x00068771]
Jesus Shaun. That's a cynical way to look at it...

Id: [0x00068772]
Doesn't make it less true.

Id: [0x00068774]
How's it going, lad? I imagine you're busy these days, not much has changed with regards to our local thugs. I'll leave you to it.

Id: [0x00068776]
Your work is bearing fruit, my boy, and I'm close to figuring out who's orchestrating this ugly symphony. But something's got people spooked beyond the usual gang stuff. Odd. Anyway, Keep on it!

Id: [0x0006877C]
I keep trying to understand how men like Washington and Jefferson could dedicate their lives to the pursuit of liberty and equality, yet have no problem owning slaves. It's hypocritical in the extreme. And your history books make only passing mention of the subject. As if, as if it were of little consequence.

Id: [0x00068783]
They had a war to win. A country's future to secure. How could they deal with all these issues at the same time?

Id: [0x00068784]
Spoken like a true apologist. We hear it today too. That matters of civil rights and equality must wait. There are conflicts to settle. Economies to salvage. What do any of these things matter if the people are not free and equal. ALL of them.

Id: [0x00068788]
They're still conscribing kids all over but I wager you've been off frying bigger fish.

Id: [0x0006878A]
You're doing it. The recruiters are scared to go out collecting. We're almost ready to make our move.

Id: [0x00068794]
What are you talking to me for? You haven't done anything about the outbreak yet.

Id: [0x00068796]
It's a start. Keep going and then we'll talk real business.

Id: [0x0006879C]
Allo, friend. The Martial Law is quite the same. You are needing to start making an impact.

Id: [0x0006879E]
Ah, the tides of change are coming in. Remain vigilant and maybe we succeed in putting an end to this.

Id: [0x000687A9]
You certainly don't disappoint! People are standing up all over the place. We're almost there.

Id: [0x000687B7]
[O que voc√™ est√° olhando?]What are you looking at?

Id: [0x000687BC]
Bit of a dick move, don't you think?

Id: [0x000687BD]
Well, I guess you could try and sneak past security instead...

Id: [0x000687D1]
Stop him!

Id: [0x000687E6]
Please don't kill me! I'll let you in!

Id: [0x000687EE]
Hm, We need all the support we can muster. Some of my men are leaving on a munitions delivery to a nearby camp and I need you to escort them. Find John Anderson upon your arrival. He'll have further instructions.

Id: [0x000687F0]
Questions?

Id: [0x000687F1]
No.

Id: [0x000687F2]
Good.

Id: [0x000687F7]
Thank goodness you're here. Doubt we could get all these crates down to the camp without you.

Id: [0x000687F8]
You do not agree with this?

Id: [0x000687F9]
You having a laugh? We're meant to garrison Westpoint and by extension hold the Hudson. It's vital- no arguing that- so why is it we're shipping out half our powder and shot?

Id: [0x000687FA]
Why not bring up your concern with Major General Arnold?

Id: [0x000687FB]
I have! He threatened to have me court-martialed for insubordination and treason, if you can believe that. So I follow orders, no matter how absurd.

Id: [0x000687FD]
What the? Thing's empty.

Id: [0x000687FE]
Ha! Seems about in line with the rest of it...

Id: [0x00068802]
Ack! The traitor is getting away. He's supposed to be on that ship! Get after him!

Id: [0x0006880C]
Drive! Quickly!

Id: [0x0006880F]
Whoa, whoa, whao. Not so fast.

Id: [0x00068815]
It's not me, friend. I'm not the real traitor. I could tell you who it is if you let me go.

Id: [0x00068816]
Listen, listen. Just turn your back for five seconds and you'll never see me again. I don't want anything to do with this place.

Id: [0x00068817]
Is it money you want? Because I got money. How much to set me free?

Id: [0x00068819]
I would not do that again.

Id: [0x0006881B]
I am warning you.

Id: [0x0006881E]
Alright, alright. Listen. I can fix this. Just give me a chance and I'll prove to you I'm a real Patriot. I want this country as much as the next man, just let me show you!

Id: [0x0006881F]
That the traitor?

Id: [0x00068820]
It is. Major General Arnold will have further orders for you.

Id: [0x00068821]
Sounds good. Welcome aboard m'lady! Hahahaha.

Id: [0x00068828]
[Voc√™ viu este homem?]Have you seen this man?

Id: [0x0006882A]
[Chame a seguran√ßa imediatamente se o vir.]Contact security immediately if you do.

Id: [0x0006882C]
[Estamos procurando este homem.]We're looking for this man.

Id: [0x0006882E]
[Se ver algo suspeito, fale com a gente imediatamente.]If you see anything suspicious, report it immediately.

Id: [0x00068830]
[Reconhece este homem?]Do you recognize him?

Id: [0x00068832]
[Tem certeza? Pense bem. √â importante.]Are you sure? Think hard. It's important.

Id: [0x00068835]
[Cai fora daqui!]Get out of here!

Id: [0x00068837]
[Isso n√£o √© com voc√™.]This doesn't involve you.

Id: [0x00068839]
[Vai cuidar da sua vida, idiota!]Mind your own business, asshole!

Id: [0x0006883B]
[Sai fora!]Get lost!

Id: [0x0006883D]
[D√° o fora!]Fuck off!

Id: [0x0006883E]
Ah. Connor. Just the man I wanted to see. Well done capturing the traitor. But I must ask more of you. There are some kegs of powder resting inside the fort. Bring them to the magazine.

Id: [0x00068842]
Dismissed.

Id: [0x00068843]
Almost there, Desmond. She's just on the other side of the stadium.

Id: [0x00068844]
Other side?!

Id: [0x00068845]
Use the catwalks to get across.

Id: [0x00068848]
He's the one!

Id: [0x0006884A]
Deal with him!

Id: [0x0006884C]
Over there! Take him out.

Id: [0x0006884E]
It is done. Only the matter of my compensation remains, something of the utmost importance to me. Deliver this letter. Make absolutely sure he gets it. Please be cautious. A mistake at this stage would be, unfortunate. When we come out on the other side of this thing, I'll make sure you're rewarded Major Andr√©. Generously.

Id: [0x0006884F]
You mean John Anderson, sir.

Id: [0x00068850]
Yes.

Id: [0x00068853]
Sir.

Id: [0x00068854]
Sir.

Id: [0x00068855]
Make sure we're not followed. If anybody sees us, kill them.

Id: [0x00068857]
That's far enough for you two. Keep a keen eye and come for me when you see the smoke.

Id: [0x00068858]
Yes sir.

Id: [0x00068859]
Yes sir.

Id: [0x00068863]
Halt!

Id: [0x00068865]
Gentlemen. I hope you belong to our party?

Id: [0x00068866]
What party?

Id: [0x00068867]
The lower party.

Id: [0x00068868]
We do.

Id: [0x00068869]
But we ain't British, friend, and you are under arrest.

Id: [0x0006886D]
No!.. Do not kill him! Search him instead.

Id: [0x00068871]
Blessed stars. His real name is Major Andr√© and he's with the British. He carries this letter on behalf of Major General Benedict Arnold.

Id: [0x00068874]
Arnold is our commanding officer.

Id: [0x00068875]
Bind Andr√©'s hands immediatly and bring him to Commander Washington. I will see to Arnold.

Id: [0x0006888D]
Connor, finished already. I have some more--

Id: [0x0006888E]
Explain this.

Id: [0x00068890]
I don't know what 'this' is.

Id: [0x00068891]
A letter, in your hand addressed to General Clinton of the British Army, confirming the surrender of Westpoint for the sum of twenty thousand pounds.

Id: [0x00068892]
This must be some sort of plot to expose the fort! I am a Patriot through and through, Connor! My actions at Saratoga speak to that, I'm sure.

Id: [0x00068893]
For you sake I hope General Washington agrees. He will be arriving here today.

Id: [0x00068895]
Regulars! Regulars! We're under attack!

Id: [0x00068899]
We've not enough men to hold the battlements!

Id: [0x0006889F]
Good on you! Now let's snuff these Tories!

Id: [0x000688A0]
Thata-boy! Every man counts in this fight!

Id: [0x000688A1]
About time somebody let us out! Lord knows you need us now!

Id: [0x000688A7]
Arnold betrayed us! That turncoat bastard!

Id: [0x000688A8]
We secure the fort! Then we deal with Arnold!

Id: [0x000688A9]
Aye!

Id: [0x000688B3]
Connor.

Id: [0x000688B4]
Arnold was behind this but he escaped.

Id: [0x000688B5]
If you did not catch him, nobody could have. [a pause]Westpoint is secure and Major Andr√© will hang for his crimes.

Id: [0x000688B6]
And Arnold?

Id: [0x000688B7]
We'll try to find him, though I have my doubts. [a pause]Whom can we trust now, if Patriot heroes are betraying us...?

Id: [0x000688B8]
You reap what you sow.

Id: [0x000688BF]
...I need to kill that bastard...

Id: [0x000688C1]
...get out of my head Kenya...

Id: [0x000688C3]
...she keeps saying they can stop it and then this happens...

Id: [0x000688C5]
...Have to find a way to keep it under control...

Id: [0x000688C9]
...goddam Assassins...

Id: [0x000688CA]
I don't know... everything. You've sacrificed a lot for me. You and Shaun both. You upgraded the Animus, helped train me, pulled me out of that coma...

Id: [0x000688CC]
You put all that work into the database. Helped me solve Clay's puzzles...

Id: [0x000688CE]
I know I haven't been the easiest person to work with... And I'm sorry for that. And I just want you to know that even if I'm shitty at showing it - I appreciate everything you've done.

Id: [0x000688D0]
So do I, Rebecca. So do I...

Id: [0x000688D3]
I wish there was a way for us to share what we learn from the Animus with others. Imagine being able to accurately answer questions about the past. Or experience lost civilizations...

Id: [0x000688D4]
But how would you cite it? We can't just reveal the machine's existence to the world.

Id: [0x000688D5]
Why not?

Id: [0x000688D6]
Desmond's right - it would be dangerous. And we still haven't found a way to manage the bleeding effect.

Id: [0x000688D7]
Maybe when we're done saving the world, we can look into it.

Id: [0x000688D8]
Even if we do manage to stave off the apocalypse - it's not like the Templars are simply going to disappear. I suspect our fight will continue long after this latest battle is finished.

Id: [0x000688DA]
So what was it like being back at Abstergo?

Id: [0x000688DD]
I didn't expect to get out of there alive. It's a good thing Cross broke down the way he did. If he wasn't losing his mind, I'd probably be dead.

Id: [0x000688DE]
I guess he never really recovered...

Id: [0x000688DF]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x000688E0]
When he first came to us he was exhibiting symptoms of the bleeding effect. It was real bad. He'd just go in and out at a moment's notice - no Animus required. Got a little violent too, sometimes. It took a while and a bunch of therapy, but we thought we had it under control. Once he went back over to Abstergo, though... who knows what they did to him.

Id: [0x000688E1]
I still worry about that happening to me.

Id: [0x000688E2]
He was RAISED in an Animus, Desmond. There's overexposure and then there's... Daniel. Poor guy. That could never happen to you. We won't let it.

Id: [0x000688E4]
When this is all over we should take a trip somewhere. Celebratory vacation!

Id: [0x000688E5]
Yeah, that sounds nice.

Id: [0x000688E6]
Listen to you. Italy, Brazil, and the United States - all in the span of a few weeks - and you're complaining about not getting out enough?

Id: [0x000688E7]
Seriously, Shaun?

Id: [0x000688E8]
No, not seriously. Are you mad? Trust me - no one wants time off more than I do, right. Do you have ANY IDEA how hard it is to crank those database entries out as fast as I do?

Id: [0x00068E61]
I regret not asking you to hack into the Abstergo servers while you were there. A couple of well-placed relays and we'd be swimming in information.

Id: [0x00068E62]
We have everything we need.

Id: [0x00068E63]
Yeah, except the key!

Id: [0x00068E64]
We're close.

Id: [0x00068E65]
How do you know?

Id: [0x00068E66]
I just... do.

Id: [0x00068E69]
I've been poking around a bit. Did you know there are machines down here that make... well, manna.

Id: [0x00068E6A]
Wizard manna or Biblical manna?

Id: [0x00068E6B]
What do you think? Biblical of course. The Greeks called it ambrosia. The Indians, Amrit or Soma. Most cultures around the world refer to a divine food, though I'd say it's taste is anything but.

Id: [0x00068E6C]
You ate something that came out of a seventy five thousand year old machine?

Id: [0x00068E6D]
And I lived to tell the tale!

Id: [0x00068E6E]
So... What did it taste like?

Id: [0x00068E6F]
Cardboard. The taste of cardboard.  Hardly the stuff of legends... Though I wonder if the first civilization didn't taste differently than we do.

Id: [0x00068E99]
Maybe the flavorizer broke.

Id: [0x00068E9A]
Flavorizer? You've certainly got a way with words, Rebecca.

Id: [0x00068E9C]
Things are getting worse outside.

Id: [0x00068E9D]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x00068E9E]
Every day for the past two weeks the sun has been throwing off larger and larger flares. Older satellites are starting to malfunction. I hear rumblings of recalling the crew on the international space station. There's already work being done as well to shield power stations and transformers on the ground...

Id: [0x00068EA0]
Not that any of it matters. This goes far beyond some brownouts... We all saw what's ACTUALLY coming.

Id: [0x00068EA1]
Do you know how it works?

Id: [0x00068EA2]
Look, I'm no physicist, but it's, it's something to do with the Earth's geomagnetic field. The flares and mass ejections disturb it, which appears to trigger seismic events. I've tried reaching out to people who might know better, but they all insist it's bunk. And I don't blame them. It sounds ridiculous...

Id: [0x00068EA3]
I wish it was...

Id: [0x00068EA5]
Hello

Id: [0x00068EA6]
Hey, You think killing Vidic set Abstergo back?

Id: [0x00068EA7]
I doubt it. Sure, he pioneered the Animus, but they've had the techology for decades now. Plenty of other people can take his place.

Id: [0x00068EA8]
And Cross?

Id: [0x00068EA9]
He was a loose cannon - I doubt anyone's mourning his death. I think these days he was more a symbol than an asset.

Id: [0x00068EAA]
Hmmm...

Id: [0x00068EAB]
Sorry. I don't mean to dismiss what you did. But it's going to take a lot more than a couple of deaths to stop the Templars.

Id: [0x00068EAE]
Oh they definitely tried. But I made things difficult for them. You can resist, you can cloud up the transmission or just refuse to move. Eventually they would have gotten what they needed but still it would have taken them weeks.

Id: [0x00068EB8]
Did Vidic put you in an Animus when you were at Abstergo?  They be able to search your memories and track you back here.

Id: [0x00068EB9]
Vidic threatened to put me in a coma once.

Id: [0x00068EBA]
It would've made you more pliable. But if the user isn't engaged, it's a mess. I know they've been working on ways to extract memories and let others sift through those memories. Maybe they're even analyzing mine right now. Maybe they'll find us. I don't know... What I do know is that we've got to get through that door.

Id: [0x00068EBB]
Yeah... I should probably get back into the Animus.

Id: [0x00068EBE]
Hey... So, uh, when this is over... And assuming it all works out... I was hoping I could... You know... Come home.

Id: [0x00068EC0]
I'd like nothing more.

Id: [0x00068EC5]
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

Id: [0x00068EC6]
My ship was held in port for two days that we might accommodate you. I lost several contracts as a result.

Id: [0x00068EC7]
I had no idea...

Id: [0x00068EC8]
Of course not. You nobles are all the same...

Id: [0x00068ECC]
Well, well. Seems our esteemed guest has deigned grace us wit' 'is presence!

Id: [0x00068ED0]
Stay outta this!

Id: [0x00068ED1]
Listen ta this Hector- thinks he can swagger on up 'ere and declare himself king 'o the castle.

Id: [0x00068ED2]
- Ta hell with the captain! And ta hell with you, Mills! Whose side you on, anyway?

Id: [0x00068EEB]
Let me help you.

Id: [0x00068EED]
Thank you kindly for the offer, but no. This is my fight.

Id: [0x00068EF1]
I suspect some of the men intend to mutiny.

Id: [0x00068EF2]
Really, what a surprise.

Id: [0x00068EF3]
As I cannot trust any of them, I am compelled to turn to you.

Id: [0x00068EF4]
And why should I help you?

Id: [0x00068EF5]
Because if they do intend to betray, I'm the only hope you have of reaching America alive.

Id: [0x00068EF7]
Well? What will it be?

Id: [0x00068EF8]
If what you say is true, what other choice do I have?

Id: [0x00068EF9]
Thank y-

Id: [0x00068EFB]
But let me be clear, should you ever dare to insult or threaten me again, I'll not hesitate to cut off your head myself.

Id: [0x00068EFD]
Are we understood?

Id: [0x00068FB4]
These fou-

Id: [0x00068FB7]
It's not right tha' he should feast on lamb and wine whilst we're stuck with tinned fish and biscuits!

Id: [0x00068FB8]
Quiet! Here he comes... make like you're working.

Id: [0x00068FB9]
Wasn't by choice.

Id: [0x00068FBA]
Aye. Blockheads, the both of them.

Id: [0x00068FBB]
So should I be watching my back?

Id: [0x00068FC1]
I think the boys learned their lesson. They're normally not so nasty. Honest. It's just the past few crossings have been a bit... rough.

Id: [0x00068FC3]
Haytham Kenway.

Id: [0x00068FC7]
Well hurry up!

Id: [0x00068FC8]
Oh?

Id: [0x00068FC9]
Captain's trying to cut costs. Reduced rations, lower wages, more dangerous cargo... It's put the crew on edge.

Id: [0x00068FCA]
Is there cause for concern, then?

Id: [0x00068FCB]
Not if I can help it. But the Captain needs to think about the way he treats his men...

Id: [0x00069048]
The Belladonna does all the work!

Id: [0x0006904A]
We did not even need your assistance, it seems!

Id: [0x0006904C]
Where are my manners...

Id: [0x0006904D]
Louis Mills. Pleased to meet you.

Id: [0x00069052]
Man the cannons! Make ready to fight!

Id: [0x00069054]
I want you below decks!

Id: [0x00069056]
Why? Let me help you secure the ship.

Id: [0x00069057]
Do you know how to rig a sail? To load a cannon? To wage war at sea? [a beat]I didn't think so. Now return to your cabin - or do I need to have you escorted?

Id: [0x0006905A]
Haytham.

Id: [0x0006905B]
Have you been topside? A ship's appeared and means to board us. But it's strange... There's no sign of mutiny aboard... It doesn't make sense.

Id: [0x0006905C]
Ah, but it does.

Id: [0x0006905D]
What do you mean?

Id: [0x0006905F]
Did you think you could escape from London so easily after what you did at the opera? That we wouldn't notice? That we wouldn't follow?

Id: [0x00069060]
Ahhh... So THAT'S what this is about...

Id: [0x00069062]
I told you to stay below decks!

Id: [0x00069063]
What do they want?

Id: [0x00069064]
Then they can have you!

Id: [0x00069066]
Is that so?

Id: [0x00069068]
They'll catch us anyway... There's nothing to be done.

Id: [0x00069069]
I can think of something...

Id: [0x0006906A]
I won't do it.

Id: [0x0006906C]
Then I will.

Id: [0x0006906E]
Alright, alright...

Id: [0x0006907D]
Stop that cart!

Id: [0x0006907F]
Halt!

Id: [0x00069081]
Stop right there!

Id: [0x00069082]
I was only followin' orders.

Id: [0x00069083]
Well now you have new ones...to stop.

Id: [0x00069098]
You lookin' for the hunting cabin in the area? It's just over there.

Id: [0x0006909B]
There's a hunting cabin not far from here. You could rest up there, if you need it.

Id: [0x0006909D]
On your way to the cabin? It's down that way.

Id: [0x0006909F]
I told you this was madness!

Id: [0x000690A2]
Searching for the hunting cabin I take it. Right down that way, mate.

Id: [0x000690AC]
Leave me alone.

Id: [0x000690AE]
What do you want? Can't you see I'm busy?

Id: [0x000690B0]
Go away.

Id: [0x000690B2]
You lookin' for another fight, that it?

Id: [0x000690B4]
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

Id: [0x000690B6]
Get outta here. I've got work to do!

Id: [0x000690B9]
I was hoping you might be able to answer some questions for me...

Id: [0x000690BA]
Sorry, no time for that. Pester the cook or doctor if you're so desperate for company.

Id: [0x000690BB]
So what do you want to know?

Id: [0x000690CA]
If you're looking for the hunting cabin, you're almost there. Over there.

Id: [0x000690CC]
The hunting cabin just around the way. You're not far off.

Id: [0x0006911B]
Here for a scrap? Let's get on with it then.

Id: [0x0006911E]
Won't get far hitting me like that!

Id: [0x00069120]
Come on! Swing at me some more!

Id: [0x00069122]
You want a chance? You gotta hit me!

Id: [0x00069124]
Right on my arse.

Id: [0x00069126]
You want to try again, just let me know little man.

Id: [0x00069128]
[H√°o' tiater√≠:io.]We fight.

Id: [0x0006912C]
[Iah tha'tahsk√©:tsha t√≥ka' tho niwati√©:sen ahsater√≠:io.]You won't best me with simple attacks.

Id: [0x0006912E]
[Iah tesa'nikonhr√≠:io.]You are impatient.

Id: [0x00069130]
[Iah thahskw√©:ni tahsk√©:tsha.]You can't counter me!

Id: [0x00069132]
[Ion'w√©:sen tsi n√≠:ioht tsi wahsater√≠:io.]Well fought.

Id: [0x00069136]
Lookin' for a tilt? Come on.

Id: [0x00069141]
You're too predictable.

Id: [0x00069143]
All you do is hit. Too easy.

Id: [0x00069145]
Nothing out of the ordinary from you eh?

Id: [0x00069147]
Caught me off guard with that.

Id: [0x00069149]
That was easy. You gotta try something else next time.

Id: [0x000691DA]
I trust you're here for a tussle. I'll give you what you want.

Id: [0x000691DC]
Now!

Id: [0x000691DE]
Impressive. Very impressive.

Id: [0x000691E3]
Another challenger. 'Bout time, I was getting bored.

Id: [0x000691E5]
You can't hit me!

Id: [0x000691E7]
Keep swinging!

Id: [0x000691E9]
Can't hit what you can't see!

Id: [0x000691EB]
You hit me.

Id: [0x000691ED]
Good try. Can't expect to beat the likes of me.

Id: [0x000691F0]
Another one. Alright, let's get it over with then.

Id: [0x000691F2]
Won't get far with me on my feet.

Id: [0x000691F4]
Standing toe-to-toe? This is easy.

Id: [0x000691F6]
Try and get me down.

Id: [0x000691F8]
Oof! That smarts.

Id: [0x000691FD]
Secure the hatch!

Id: [0x000691FF]
Surrender and I will see that you are treated with honor.

Id: [0x00069200]
If you wish to treat me with honor, give me a sword.

Id: [0x00069201]
Are you sure this is how you want to play it?

Id: [0x00069219]
It stands upright, as a man, but its whole body is covered in a thick pelt. Its gait is slow and lurching- I've seen it with my own two eyes. It's clever, always at a distance or with something between us- like it knows where I'm going to be before I get there. Things go missing where it goes, that much is certain. All manner of trinket. It took a man's prize buck antlers clear off his cabin wall. Takes kills out of traps too, wrenching 'em open with his big mitts. Somebody should find it and bring back its head for the whole world to see.

Id: [0x0006921B]
I seen it! Mean looking thing. Tall and hairy like an ox! It's a demon. I'm telling you!

Id: [0x0006921C]
A bloody demon? Criminey!

Id: [0x0006921E]
We was out after elk when we saw it. It was carryin' a bear trap, it was.

Id: [0x00069220]
An entire barrel of salt cod is missing. I know it was that creature. I just know it.

Id: [0x0006922B]
Hallo. You're the chap that was down the hill, yes? Welcome! Care for a leg of venison? Maybe a hen? I have some lovely wine, if you like. A Bordeaux!

Id: [0x0006922C]
No thank you. Who are you and what is this place?

Id: [0x0006922E]
I'm just a man and this is my home! Doesn't look like much from the outside but that's sort of the point. Not much of a people person.

Id: [0x0006922F]
The locals think you are a demon of some sort.

Id: [0x00069230]
Is that what they're saying now? Probably frustrated on account of my naughty little habit. I take things. I know it's wrong, I do, but I just can't help myself. Thing is, I like my privacy. If I gave you some coin, might you keep my home a secret? I'd be much obliged.

Id: [0x00069233]
I'm not one for sailing but I know it's out there. Some call it a kraken, others just a sea monster. They say it's fifty feet long if it's an inch and it rolls ships for sport. You won't find me on the high seas searching for the beast, that's a guarantee I can give you, but it's a riddle that needs solving.

Id: [0x00069236]
My son saw the beast and he's no liar. He said it was a fifty foot snake in the harbour.

Id: [0x00069237]
Then call me a land lubber so long as that thing is out there.

Id: [0x00069239]
It moves quick for its size so I couldn't get a good look at it.

Id: [0x0006923A]
What was it?

Id: [0x0006923B]
kraken.

Id: [0x0006923D]
Nope.

Id: [0x0006923E]
You got to be having a laugh.

Id: [0x0006923F]
Nope. Not getting on that boat.

Id: [0x00069240]
Because of the monster? It's nonsense!

Id: [0x00069241]
Then get on the boat yourself.

Id: [0x00069245]
You seen the serpent?

Id: [0x00069246]
You bet your arse I've seen the serpent. Thing was horrifying.

Id: [0x00069249]
Where was it?

Id: [0x0006924A]
Just out past the breakwater. Came up to the surface to have a look then plunged right back down again. The parts I saw was thirty feet, who knows how much remained under water?

Id: [0x0006924C]
Jack's say there's an old man that's always around when the beast appears.

Id: [0x0006924D]
Jack's say a lot of things.

Id: [0x0006924E]
But this be one I believe. They say he commands the thing.

Id: [0x0006924F]
Pfff.

Id: [0x00069251]
Some old man orderin' a kraken about. What a bunch o' fluff.

Id: [0x00069252]
Dunno, mate. A lot o' men I trust spin the same yarn.

Id: [0x00069255]
You hear the serpent weaver died?

Id: [0x00069256]
The ol' thief's buried not far from here. Man was a blight. Good riddance.

Id: [0x00069258]
That old fellow people said called the kraken bought the farm not long ago. Nobody's seen the beast since.

Id: [0x00069259]
So it was true then.

Id: [0x0006925A]
Didn't say that. Maybe you could ask his widow, she won't leave his grave.

Id: [0x0006925E]
You come to pay your respects? You're the first. He didn't have many friends. People just didn't understand. He was a good trader. A good husband. I never wanted for anything.

Id: [0x00069263]
I'd been out in the puckerbrush for six weeks. Game was scarce in the area and my belly needed fillin' so a broke for the coast and some crab or lobster from the tide pools. That's when I saw it. A lighthouse said to have been abandoned years ago, but there it was fires a burnin'. Then the sound happened. A moaning in the wind. My heart crept up my throat so high I could taste it. Just then a ten point buck startled and I took after it. Got the buck but never went back to that lighthouse. Spirits in there I wager. I'd challenge any man to set foot inside.

Id: [0x00069265]
Crying in the wind. I've heard it. My wife's heard it. It's there, no mistaking it. Spirits.

Id: [0x00069266]
You believe in that?

Id: [0x00069267]
I didn't until I heard it with my own ears.

Id: [0x00069269]
I'd do it. I would!

Id: [0x0006926A]
Hogwash.

Id: [0x0006926B]
Show me the pounds and I'll sleep in the haunted lighthouse, for one night.

Id: [0x0006926D]
You're heading up that way?

Id: [0x0006926E]
Beaches up there are teaming with crab. Nobody goes there on account of the lighthouse. I figure so long as I keep away from it, no reason for those troubled souls to bother me.

Id: [0x00069271]
[moaning]

Id: [0x00069277]
Me beauties is comin', they is. Keep a weather eye on the horizon and they'll come. Hundreds of 'em. Then I won't be alone no more. You'll see.

Id: [0x00069279]
The first time I saw the light was back in Boston. I was trading my biggest take of the season when the fire rose behind Beacon Hill. Went straight up in the night sky, passed the moon. Then it was gone. I wasn't alone. Those next to me had their heads cocked the same- craned as far back as it could go- mouths agape. Couldn't tell you what it was but I can tell you it wasn't of this earth.

Id: [0x0006927B]
What do you know that shoots fire in the sky like that?

Id: [0x0006927C]
Don't know anything in the colonies- doesn't mean it wasn't of the Orient or some other place.

Id: [0x0006927E]
Those burns in the fields are signs from the Lord. He's trying to send a message.

Id: [0x0006927F]
I bet he's trying to tell us to stop all this fighting. I wish we'd heed him.

Id: [0x00069281]
Lights in the sky.

Id: [0x00069282]
Lights in the bloody sky.

Id: [0x00069283]
As bad omens as there are.

Id: [0x00069284]
Yup.

Id: [0x00069286]
Burnt fields.

Id: [0x00069287]
Burnt bloody fields.

Id: [0x0006928C]
You look like a man up for a challenge. There's a bobcat 'round these parts, wiley as they come. I've lost count of them who've tried to get him on account of his pelt, pretty near perfect. You got that you'd make a mint not to mention something of a reputation.

Id: [0x0006928E]
Ever come across King Edward the Elk? You'd know if you had. He's never found a mate on account of his aggression. Most hunters leave him be for fear of his charge. Grumpy old bastard's afraid of nothing. Word has it he doesn't like horses too much but I'm not willing to risk my head on rumors.

Id: [0x0006928F]
There's a valley nearby that's used in Kanien‚Äôk√©ha rite of passage ceremonies. I been told there's a cougar that's staked his claim on the area and is the cause of a few too many accidents for the young'uns. Might do some good to put an end to it. Probably get a damn nice pelt out of it while you're at it.

Id: [0x00069293]
Some folks were fixin' to settle on a plot not far from here. Seems a big black bear with a taste for human blood settled there first. Bring the beast down and some good people would be grateful.

Id: [0x00069295]
Another hunter came through a few days ago telling a story I've heard before- fifteen point buck that's impervious to musket shot. They hit him every time but every time the big fella just gets right back up. I reckon a blade to his throat would do the job but he's hard to get close to.

Id: [0x00069298]
You want to impress some people bring down the alpha wolf in these woods. He's big, fast, mean and elusive. Only a couple men have ever seen him and I tell you they wish they didn't.

Id: [0x0006929D]
Fight!

Id: [0x000692A3]
Winner!

Id: [0x000692A7]
Begin!

Id: [0x000692A9]
Have fun seein' me now!

Id: [0x000692AB]
Open your eyes! Ha ha!

Id: [0x000692AD]
Hope it doesn't burn too much!

Id: [0x000692B0]
Here's our winner!

Id: [0x000692B4]
Fight!

Id: [0x000692B6]
Can never have too many friends!

Id: [0x000692B9]
Uh-oh! Looks like the crowd's turned on ya!

Id: [0x000692BB]
Careful now!

Id: [0x000692BF]
Winner! Looks like we got a real contender!

Id: [0x000692C3]
Go at it!

Id: [0x000692C5]
How are you feeling?

Id: [0x000692C7]
Not well? You might want to hurry up.

Id: [0x000692C9]
Shame you won't be standing long enough to finish the fight.

Id: [0x000692CE]
Go!

Id: [0x000692D0]
Come here and let me finish you!

Id: [0x000692D3]
One more of those and you'll be done!

Id: [0x000692D5]
Gimme one more!

Id: [0x000692D9]
Fightin' for the title he is!

Id: [0x000692E0]
We have a NEW CHAMPION!!

Id: [0x000692E5]
You're outta here. Try again next time.

Id: [0x000692E7]
That's all she wrote.

Id: [0x00069696]
Piss off.

Id: [0x00069698]
If you want to catch a beating, get closer.

Id: [0x0006969A]
Keep moving, mate.

Id: [0x0006969B]
You won't catch him!

Id: [0x0006969D]
Leave off him!

Id: [0x0006969F]
Ended that nuisance for good, you did. Very grateful. These thugs think they own the neighborhood.

Id: [0x000696A1]
Many thanks, stranger. Those chaps have had the run of the place of late. Good that somebody's finally standing up.

Id: [0x000696A3]
Good of you to try anyway. That's more than most do.

Id: [0x000696A5]
He made off, did he? I appreciate the effort.

Id: [0x000696A7]
He's gone. It's just another day for around here.

Id: [0x000696A8]
You hit like a dandy!

Id: [0x000696A9]
Keep talkin' and see where it gets ya.

Id: [0x000696AA]
Oof!

Id: [0x000696AC]
You're a Godsend! Thank you!

Id: [0x000696AE]
Thought I would die in there. Thank you kindly.

Id: [0x000696B1]
I wish someone would string one of those animals up from the rooftops to make an example.

Id: [0x000696B3]
They should all hang. Brutes and monsters the lot of them.

Id: [0x000696B4]
You planning on doing something about them? I'd suggest making an example. Hang the bastards.

Id: [0x000696B6]
He hung him!

Id: [0x000696B7]
Get movin' ya nit-wit!

Id: [0x000696B9]
What in God's name!?

Id: [0x000696BA]
He's a goner!

Id: [0x000696C6]
You pushed my quill onto the contract!

Id: [0x000696C7]
That's enough.

Id: [0x000696C8]
I don't want to fight no war. I just want to go home.

Id: [0x000696C9]
I've heard enough out of the lot of you. Not another word until we get to camp.

Id: [0x000696CA]
You are free of this.

Id: [0x000696CB]
Thank you! Thank you!

Id: [0x000696CD]
You did not consent to this. Go home.

Id: [0x000696CE]
You're a great man!

Id: [0x000696D0]
Me mum'll be grateful! Thanks!

Id: [0x000696D4]
Help me! I didn't sign up for nothing!

Id: [0x000696D6]
Leave me be! I never agreed to be a soldier!

Id: [0x000696D8]
Let me go! I'm no soldier!

Id: [0x000696D9]
Appreciate it friend but I'm sure they'll be back.

Id: [0x000696DB]
Good of you to help but these recruiters are relentless.

Id: [0x000696DD]
They're off my back for now. I thank you for that.

Id: [0x000696DF]
My boy ain't fightin' your war for you.

Id: [0x000696E0]
This isn't a discussion. He's coming with us.

Id: [0x000696E1]
It's not right! You can't force him!

Id: [0x000696E2]
He's a subject of the King and his King requires him to fight. [to his men]Keep looking boys, he's around.

Id: [0x000696E4]
'Scuse me, sir. Can you help me? I'm tryin' to get to that cart and leave town. Those men are trying to force me to join the army. I don't want to!

Id: [0x000696E6]
They've seen me!

Id: [0x000696E8]
I'm pinched!

Id: [0x000696EA]
We're caught!

Id: [0x000696F9]
I'm not going to fight! I don't want nothing to do with this!

Id: [0x000696FA]
You will fight or you will die. Your choice.

Id: [0x000696FC]
This is how you make the army so big? Forcing guys like us?

Id: [0x000696FD]
Quiet.

Id: [0x000696FF]
This isn't right! I'm a cobbler not a soldier!

Id: [0x00069700]
You are now.

Id: [0x00069729]
Mister? Can you help me? My father's real sick. He needs a healer. Can you carry him to one?

Id: [0x0006972B]
My father's so sick he can't walk. He's got the pox. Can you carry him to the doctor's please?

Id: [0x0006974A]
You are a good man. The sickness just exploded out of nowhere. I hope for my boy's sake that I survive it.

Id: [0x0006974B]
How did you get it?

Id: [0x0006974C]
Don't know. Haven't talked to anybody with it.

Id: [0x0006974E]
Back off! These are my blankets!

Id: [0x00069750]
Move along, move along. I've claimed these blankets for myself.

Id: [0x00069753]
Shoo! Shoo!

Id: [0x00069755]
Git outa here ya bag o' fleas!

Id: [0x00069757]
That was good of you. The pox have got everything around here out of sorts.

Id: [0x00069759]
Good on ya. The sickness is rampant 'round here.

Id: [0x00069805]
And where might I find James?

Id: [0x00069806]
The galley's your best bet. Now, if you'll excuse me?

Id: [0x00069807]
And where might I find him?

Id: [0x00069808]
Right behind you, actually. He's the one sitting on the barrel.

Id: [0x0006981B]
The Assassins have long since branched out across the globe. The Colonies are no exception. The man you killed was a Templar.

Id: [0x0006981E]
It needs to be stopped! These men are being executed for no reason!

Id: [0x0006981F]
Follow me!

Id: [0x00069821]
Back off, sir. This is the Crown's business.

Id: [0x00069823]
Move along, unless you want to join them.

Id: [0x00069825]
Keep walking if you value your life.

Id: [0x00069827]
Thank you. Thank you ever so much. It's a just thing you've done.

Id: [0x00069829]
[sobs]

Id: [0x0006982B]
Over here.

Id: [0x0006982D]
Rebel! Spare a minute?

Id: [0x0006982F]
I am not a rebel.

Id: [0x00069830]
Not a Redcoat either by the looks of it. They put a bullet in me, all because of what I know. Can you help me get to my boss?

Id: [0x00069832]
You must be him. I've been waiting too long. I know who the traitors are and they're bringing lists of the Patriot leaders around here to the Redcoats RIGHT NOW. Find a way to swap this fake list with the real ones and the rebellion can fight on.

Id: [0x00069834]
A rebel is after me! Help!

Id: [0x00069836]
Patriots are chasing me!

Id: [0x00069837]
I'm being followed! Help me!

Id: [0x00069839]
Protect me! They're coming for me!

Id: [0x0006983A]
Oh God! Help!

Id: [0x0006983C]
He's going to kill me!

Id: [0x0006983D]
Very well. I need information on the man responsible for this. He has men all over the place- corrupt Redcoats. Maybe you can get them to talk.

Id: [0x00069859]
You're a godsend! I mean only to bring my crops to market. But these Redcoats are demanding it. I told them no but they will be back. Can you help me?

Id: [0x0006985A]
I am grateful for your help but we need to get them out of sight before a patrol comes asking questions. I can carry one. You carry the other.

Id: [0x0006985C]
They beat us for begging! Just distract them for a moment and we'll take what we need.

Id: [0x0006985E]
Still too close, mister. Draw 'em off further.

Id: [0x00069860]
Too many eyes on us.

Id: [0x00069862]
Can't do it with this many people around.

Id: [0x00069864]
Another hungry night.

Id: [0x00069866]
Nobody can help us.

Id: [0x00069868]
We'll starve before long.

Id: [0x00069916]
How?

Id: [0x00069917]
A pair of our more ambitious Adventurers set out a few weeks back and have yet to return. Find out what befell our friends and you'll do well to earn a seat among us.

Id: [0x00069944]
Ready when you are, Desmond.

Id: [0x00069950]
Home stretch, Desmond.

Id: [0x00069981]
That's a constraint. These are optional objectives that raise your synchronization rate.

Id: [0x00069984]
Alright Desmond. Follow the onscreen instructions and kill the two templars.

Id: [0x00069985]
Yeah, I wonder if he'll have better luck than he did with those jar carriers back in Abstergo, remember that?  30 minutes to pass some ladies with jars? Really?

Id: [0x0006999F]
Ah! Connor. What do you think of my work thus far?

Id: [0x000699A0]
Monsieur (Mister) Connor. A pleasure as always. What brings you?

Id: [0x000699A1]
Hmmm... This is taking longer than it should. Probably because something in the temple chose your ancestor and not us. Why don't we speed up the synchronization process by having you practice with your ancestor.

Id: [0x000699A2]
Alright. What do you need me to do?

Id: [0x000699A3]
We'll start simple. Walk to the marker over there.

Id: [0x000699A5]
Perfect. See? Your synchronization rate is increasing.

Id: [0x000699A7]
Now catch up to this next marker by running after it.

Id: [0x000699AA]
Okay Desmond - let's practice climbing on these objects.

Id: [0x000699AD]
Free-run your way through this little obstacle course.

Id: [0x000699B1]
All you have to do here is jump the gap.

Id: [0x000699BB]
Yes... So close... Open the door...

Id: [0x000699BD]
Return when you have found it... When the key is in your hands...

Id: [0x000699C0]
She?

Id: [0x000699C1]
Juno, dad. She's... talking to me.

Id: [0x000699C5]
The key must be the amulet Haytham took from London.

Id: [0x00069AB9]
Alright, here goes.

Id: [0x00069ABA]
So who the hell is Daniel Cross?

Id: [0x00069ABB]
I've set up some cameras topside. If anyone shows up, we'll see it.

Id: [0x00069ABC]
I'd suggest you go see about finding a socket for that power source. Or we can return to Connor if you prefer. All the artifacts in the world won't mean a thing without the key.

Id: [0x00069ABE]
Good luck, Desmond!

Id: [0x00069ABF]
He's headed up the elevator shaft!

Id: [0x00069AC1]
Need eyes on him!

Id: [0x00069AC2]
He can't be far.

Id: [0x00069AC3]
Send someone in!

Id: [0x00069AC6]
Come on! Hurry up!

Id: [0x00069AC9]
Where the hell is he...?

Id: [0x00069ACA]
I'd get that power source hooked up before heading back into the animus - but it's your call.

Id: [0x00069AD3]
Alright, time to see what's inside.

Id: [0x00069AD4]
Not quite. We still need to get the place powered up.

Id: [0x00069AD5]
Find the remaining pedestals and plug in the power sources.

Id: [0x00069AD6]
I'm on it.

Id: [0x00069AD7]
The men are bolstered. Focused. It is good you have come.

Id: [0x00069AD8]
You are too kind. Lord knows my journey was far from certain. The trials we suffered getting here were strange and many. I dressed as a woman, Connor, to evade British spies. Did you know that?

Id: [0x00069AD9]
Guess this is it.

Id: [0x00069ADA]
We're right behind you.

Id: [0x00069ADB]
I did not. As a woman you say?

Id: [0x00069ADC]
It is the truth. King George had already stopped our crossing once in Bordeaux, threatening to seize my newly purchased ship, La Victoire, and arrest me. But I was born stubborn and such a warning could not dissuade me. So we rode for Spain and bought passage aboard a ship there. George's spies had followed us every step of the way. Disguise was the only remaining option...mon dieu. (my God)

Id: [0x00069ADD]
No man can doubt your commitment and you are invaluable to the cause. You did what you needed to do. [with a chuckle]I am certain I would have done the same.

Id: [0x00069ADE]
But of course you would! I expect nothing less!

Id: [0x00069ADF]
I wanted to ask you something: why is this revolution so important to you?

Id: [0x00069AE0]
Hm. Since I decided to embark upon this adventure, through all the lords and merchants and soldiers I've spoken to, you are the first to ask me this. [beat]Have you ever been to France?

Id: [0x00069AE3]
I have not.

Id: [0x00069AE4]
One day, when all this is over, I will invite you to Paris to stay with me and my family. She is the most beautiful city in all the world, Connor, full of art and culture, women and wine. But she is sick on the inside, black and rotting. But here... here is something quite different. On the outside the colonies are dirty and dangerous, unforgiving and uncivilized. But on the inside they GLOW. And that is why I am here. To learn. I want to return home able to touch France's black heart and make it glow once more.

Id: [0x00069AE6]
What news do you bring me?

Id: [0x00069AE7]
No news, Commander. I was merely curious how your assistants were faring.

Id: [0x00069AE8]
Without them we would be lost. It's as simple as that. With Lafayette drilling our men, it's possible our next engagement will not be one sided. Have you had the opportunity to meet Casimir Pulaski?

Id: [0x00069AE9]
I have not.

Id: [0x00069AEA]
Unfortunate. He's another of these soldiers we've hired from overseas. A Polish man capable of fighting on horseback the likes of which I have never seen. I intend to name him Commander of the Horse and when spring comes and the battles resume, the Regulars will fear the charge of his Patriot Cavalry.

Id: [0x00069AEB]
I look forward to that day, Commander.

Id: [0x00069AEC]
As do I, Connor. As do I.

Id: [0x00069AED]
The season for war is fast approaching, Commander. Have you decided upon a strategy?

Id: [0x00069AEE]
You cut to the core of things, don't you Connor? We are divided. The British have Philadelphia and we hold Boston. Howe won't try for Boston again, there is no sense to such a maneuver. The port in New York- and by extension the Hudson- will be his prize and we will march there to meet him. For glory or for ruin.

Id: [0x00069AEF]
Are you sure that wise, Commander?

Id: [0x00069AF0]
Hesitant to take action? You? I'm surprised. Our army is as prepared and large as ever and the time for patience has passed. We need to strike a decisive blow this spring and New York will be the stage. Whether we achieve victory or not will remain in the Lord's hands. We've done all we can.

Id: [0x00069AF3]
Connor.

Id: [0x00069AF4]
Commander.

Id: [0x00069AF5]
It's good to see you.

Id: [0x00069AF6]
You have what you set out for. What will you do with it?

Id: [0x00069AF7]
A fair question but if truth be told, I do not know. Men with far greater minds than mine will build this country's foundations, a task I am simply not equipped for. Have you played Bocce before? I'm really growing quite fond of it. I think I'll have a green built at Mount Vernon when I return.

Id: [0x00069AF8]
All that death and sacrifice and you mean to leave the important tasks to 'better men' while you play games? [disgusted]I might have expected it.

Id: [0x00069AF9]
Connor...

Id: [0x00069AFD]
Good day, Connor. How are you faring?

Id: [0x00069B00]
I will honor him, in time. I just hope that what I do is enough.

Id: [0x00069B04]
Whether you think you are capable or worthy of the task, after the things you have done to ensure this outcome, you should not have the luxury of peace.

Id: [0x00069B17]
If anybody is capable of honoring a man the likes of Achilles, it's you, Connor.

Id: [0x00069B18]
How is your church?

Id: [0x00069B19]
It's everything I could have wanted and more. The people here are hard working and appreciative of my services. They contribute more than most I've seen. I understand our God is not for you, but the community is strong when we gather within these walls, that much you should see.

Id: [0x00069B1A]
I will pass through one of these days.

Id: [0x00069B20]
Hello, Connor.

Id: [0x00069B21]
Ellen. What are you working on?

Id: [0x00069B22]
Oh, some such thing for one of these lovely people. They keep me busy. I wanted to thank you personally, for what you've done for Maria and I. We had simply grown accustomed to Quincent's nonsense- thought that was just how life was. When we arrived here I realized how far off we actually were. Maria will grow up surrounded by respect and love and that is a debt I will never be able to pay.

Id: [0x00069B23]
There is no debt to be paid, Ellen.

Id: [0x00069B24]
I thought as much.

Id: [0x00069B30]
How's it going ?

Id: [0x00069B31]
I am well. You seem hard at work.

Id: [0x00069B32]
Always. Feels good to be swinging a hammer again. Though I may look it, I'm not built for soldiering. [points to his head]Up here.

Id: [0x00069B33]
How did you come to be a Regular, then?

Id: [0x00069B34]
Lost my government contracts back home. All of the sudden my thriving business was dead. Lost my shop, my home. Had no family, no other trade. The service offered food and pay and a chance to see the world, so I took it without really thinking what it meant. Before long I wound up on Bunker Hill firing a musket at men just like me...you know the rest.

Id: [0x00069B35]
And I am glad to be a part of it.

Id: [0x00069B36]
You're telling me! Anyway, this hammer you bought me is top notch. Wouldn't be able to work Norris' steel without it. That man really knows what he's doing, this knife ought to be something special.

Id: [0x00069B37]
Those British weren't expecting to run into the likes of me!

Id: [0x00069B38]
The skinny Scottish runt's what drove 'em off, that much we can be sure of.

Id: [0x00069B39]
I have seen how fearsome Terry can get, I am certain he is right.

Id: [0x00069B3A]
Hey!

Id: [0x00069B3B]
Ha ha ha!

Id: [0x00069B3C]
Ha ha ha! I want to thank you men, again, for what you did. I would have been hanging from a tree in Concord if not for you. Terry's tiny fists included.

Id: [0x00069B47]
Hey!

Id: [0x00069B49]
Ha ha ha ha haaaaa.

Id: [0x00069B4A]
I left behind some good folks at home. Men like you that would die for a friend. Never thought I'd find that again but here we are.

Id: [0x00069B55]
Allo, Connor.

Id: [0x00069B56]
Norris. How are you?

Id: [0x00069B57]
Alright. Remember we talked about Myriam?

Id: [0x00069B58]
I do. And the cougar she felled.

Id: [0x00069B59]
One shot. Confident and precise. Incroyable. (Incredible.) I like her.

Id: [0x00069B5A]
She is a good friend, we all do.

Id: [0x00069B5B]
Not like that, Connor.

Id: [0x00069B5C]
Oh. OH! [beat]Well good for you!

Id: [0x00069B5D]
Only good for me if she likes me back. She is a strong woman. An independent woman. I admire her.

Id: [0x00069B5E]
I wish you well the best in your quest, Norris.

Id: [0x00069B61]
Norris! How is the mine? Is there anything worth your time down there?

Id: [0x00069B62]
Most definitely. Copper, Connor. And a healthy amount of it.

Id: [0x00069B63]
Excellent. I am glad. I have been meaning to ask, is Norris a common French name?

Id: [0x00069B64]
My real name is not Norris. It's Maurice.

Id: [0x00069B65]
But you told me...

Id: [0x00069B66]
I did. When I arrived in Boston people started calling me Norris and I got tired of correcting them all the time. Just before we met I had been talking with that lady at the pub, she said she liked my name 'Norris'. I decided to stick with it.

Id: [0x00069B67]
Would you prefer I called you by your real name?

Id: [0x00069B68]
Nah. Everybody here knows me as Norris, Myriam included. Names can change but people stay the same, isn't that right, Connor?

Id: [0x00069B69]
Very true.

Id: [0x00069B6C]
Myriam. These are for you. Non. (No.) Allo, Myriam. I thought you might like these.

Id: [0x00069B6D]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x00069B6E]
Oh! Just- practicing. Uh. Prudence was certain about the flowers?

Id: [0x00069B6F]
It was her suggestion.

Id: [0x00069B70]
Something doesn't feel right. Like this is not what Myriam would appreciate. But what do I know.

Id: [0x00069B71]
It is the gesture more than the gift itself, I imagine.

Id: [0x00069B72]
Maybe, maybe. Bon, (good) time to do this. Wish me luck.

Id: [0x00069B73]
Good luck, my friend.

Id: [0x00069B77]
I have been thinking about what you told me. Myriam needs a new knife. I am still searching for a buyer for my copper so I don't have the money to purchase one right now, nor the time to go to Boston.

Id: [0x00069B78]
Big Dave is a skilled smith. I am sure he could help you.

Id: [0x00069B79]
He could! But I need to find steel. Top quality steel. Something special. You have given me something to think about. Thank you Connor.

Id: [0x00069B7F]
Hiya, Connor. Popping by for a visit?

Id: [0x00069B80]
Have you had anymore trouble since the poacher?

Id: [0x00069B81]
Nah. And I don't think we'll be seeing much more. Word's spreading that this village is not to be trifled with.

Id: [0x00069B82]
Good to hear it.

Id: [0x00069B83]
But I tell you, if I hadn't had this knife from Norris, we might not be sitting here today. My musket dry fired and this blade was all I had. When I pulled it, its quality was clear. Perfectly balanced, feather light but strong as all hell. It's a beautiful piece of work. Nobody has ever given me such a thoughtful gift. Ever.

Id: [0x00069B84]
Norris will be glad that you like it.

Id: [0x00069B85]
Baffles me how a man like him has no wife. Kind, considerate, hard worker. [laughs]The women of Boston's loss and my gain!

Id: [0x00069B89]
You must not force such things. Nature will grant you with a young one when the time is right.

Id: [0x00069B8A]
We hope you're right, Connor. At the very least, we are at peace here.

Id: [0x00069B8D]
Dr. White called upon us earlier! A very unexpected surprise. One that has put both Prudence and I at ease.

Id: [0x00069B8E]
The village is growing and a healer's services will benefit all.

Id: [0x00069B8F]
Indeed! [beat]It's hard to explain how I am feeling right now. My wife is resting healthy and safe, full with child in our warm home. The community is kind and attentive and the land is rich. It was not long ago that such a life was only a dream for us, Connor.

Id: [0x00069B90]
All people deserve to feel safe and free.

Id: [0x00069B91]
Hopefully a day will come when all men of the Colonies will share your perspective. But it will be a long hard road, that much is certain.

Id: [0x00069BAC]
Not a day goes by that one of the boys doesn't hurt himself. I'll get some rest with the doctor around, sending the boys his way.

Id: [0x00069BAD]
I know what you mean. Maria is all over the property like a mad-girl. Norris found her in his MINE yesterday with a great big gash in her knee. That girl, I tell you.

Id: [0x00069BAE]
It sounds like you all have your hands full.

Id: [0x00069BAF]
You could say that!

Id: [0x00069BB0]
Having the doctor here is great for all of us Connor. Thank you for finding him and bringing him here.

Id: [0x00069BB1]
He came here because of you. I only brought him the offer.

Id: [0x00069BB7]
Remembering old times, Achilles?

Id: [0x00069BB8]
Connor. Oh. Yes, I suppose I was. Seems like so long ago.

Id: [0x00069BB9]
Who was the Assassin this belonged to?

Id: [0x00069BBA]
Originally it was John De La Tour's, the first Assassin in the Colonies. Then it was mine for a time. [beat]The things I've done wearing that armor... some are uplifting to recall, others- very painful indeed. One day I will hand it over to you, Connor. It is your duty to keep it. It serves as a reminder for how long our Brotherhood has really been here. How long we've been protecting the people of this land. But here I am going on again, I know you appreciate what it is.

Id: [0x00069BBC]
What is it, Old Man?

Id: [0x00069BBD]
Just an old painting.

Id: [0x00069BBE]
I have gathered that much. Why will you not open it?

Id: [0x00069BBF]
It is something close to me. Something that I can't bare to look at just yet. Perhaps someday I will muster up the courage to gaze upon it again, but not yet.

Id: [0x00069BCE]
Is everything alright here?

Id: [0x00069BCF]
No! It's not alright! Godfrey's a bloody block-head!

Id: [0x00069BD0]
Everything's fine, Connor. Terry'll run outa steam or I'll knock him out- which ever comes first.

Id: [0x00069BD1]
You'll see what comes first!

Id: [0x00069BD4]
Hey Connor!

Id: [0x00069BD5]
Gentleman. You seem to be getting along.

Id: [0x00069BD6]
Oh aye. We're just on our way to have an ale. You might have noticed, I've got a bit of a temper problem. Diana's fine, the spuds are fine. We've got a good thing going here. I'm just happy I didn'ae hurt ol' Godfrey. Wouldn'ay have been able to forgive myself.

Id: [0x00069BD7]
So am I, Terry. So grateful you didn't poke me with your tiny fists.

Id: [0x00069BD8]
Donae rile me up!

Id: [0x00069BD9]
Alright, alright. Take it easy.

Id: [0x00069BDA]
I am happy things are well again.

Id: [0x00069BDD]
Hey. Stop a minute.

Id: [0x00069BE0]
Hold on a second, mister.

Id: [0x00069BE2]
We wanna talk to you.

Id: [0x00069BE4]
Noticed you got a thief's hand. You want to prove yourself here's a list of things for you to get. Go on, try to impress us.

Id: [0x00069BE9]
You've done pretty good for a big fella! We're ALMOST impressed. But not quite. Complete this list and you'll be a little closer.

Id: [0x00069BEA]
Will I get something for my troubles aside from impressing a twelve year old girl?

Id: [0x00069BEB]
Maybe. But you're no even close to THAT yet. Keep to the shadows!

Id: [0x00069BED]
There you are! Blimey! You've really got all of it!? You're the first adult to get this far since Crook'd Jaw Joseph. Here's our final list. Complete this and you'll earn our respect.

Id: [0x00069BF0]
Honestly, mister. We are impressed. Most impressed. If you need us, we're at your service.

Id: [0x00069BF2]
When do I get to meet the rest of you?

Id: [0x00069BF3]
Nobody else, just us! Bye now!

Id: [0x00069BF9]
Heya Desmond. Sorry for the interruption, but I just want to walk you through managing your Assassin recruits real quick.

Id: [0x00069BFA]
Go ahead and open up the Assassin selection wheel.

Id: [0x00069BFC]
Highlight the guild menu option.

Id: [0x00069BFE]
Select the manage recruits option.

Id: [0x00069C00]
Now go ahead and choose "train".

Id: [0x00069C02]
Here you can pick the recruit you want to train. Since you've only got one at the moment, go ahead and select him.

Id: [0x00069C05]
Now you'll see a list of customization options.

Id: [0x00069C06]
New Assassins will gain experience by performing actions or completing Assassin contracts.

Id: [0x00069C07]
When a recruit has leveled up, new items and abilities are unlocked. Overall health and damage increase as well.

Id: [0x00069C08]
Select the "skill" option to manage the recruit's skill bank.

Id: [0x00069C0A]
In this menu, skills can be purchased with points and then assigned to a recruit.

Id: [0x00069C0B]
Skills can also be removed. Doing so will refund the skill point and allow you to select a new skill.

Id: [0x00069C0C]
Now let's take a look at some other options.

Id: [0x00069C0E]
Go ahead and select the weapons menu.

Id: [0x00069C12]
To equip a recruit with a weapon, you need to buy it from a store first.

Id: [0x00069C13]
Go ahead and select a weapon.

Id: [0x00069C2D]
As you complete contracts and progress through the past, additional missions will be unlocked.

Id: [0x00069C32]
I found the beast you spoke of, covered in fur head to toe. Whereas the tales of his wits and bent for theft are true, those of him being a monster are not. He is just a man. A man who chooses to live in solitude but I know not where he makes his home. As for the missing property, I might suggest being more careful.

Id: [0x00069C34]
People across Boston spoke of seeing the monster. Reports varied in the details but most agreed that it was long and black and only appeared in the presence of an old man. Turns out the creature was the old man himself, diving in the water with a contraption that allowed him to breathe while submerged. The machine itself was as startling as any monster, but I can assure you it is safe to sail again.

Id: [0x00069C37]
I set foot in the lighthouse and it was abandoned- abandoned by any man intending to use it for it's true purpose. It has become home to a mad old sailor who cries in the night and mutters in the day. There are no spirits up there, none that must be feared at any rate.

Id: [0x00069C3B]
It is hard to find a person in Boston who has not seen the fire in the sky, it is the talk of the town. But my investigation revealed that the fire is most certainly of this earth. A man in the area had an affinity for explosions and was setting whole barrels of powder aflame for sport- until one day he got too close. Needless to say, there will be no more fire in the Boston sky.

Id: [0x00069C3F]
I've never seen him myself but I've heard the stories from here to Kentucky. A German mercenary- Hessians is what they call 'em- was fighting a battle when a cannonball took his head clean off. His whole battalion was routed and they lost the encounter. But the lad didn't die. He's been wandering the bush on horseback around the battlefield ever since, searching for his head, chasin' innocents when he sees 'em, taking their domes for his own. He wears a pumpkin for a head now, until he finds what he's looking for. Like I said, I haven't seen 'em, but I have seen the bodies he leaves lying about, headless and grotesque. God rest their souls.

Id: [0x00069C41]
I ain't going foragin' o'er there no more. I've seen the headless man once and that's 'nough for me. You can't make me.

Id: [0x00069C42]
Come on. A man with a pumpkin for a head It's a myth!

Id: [0x00069C44]
My wife's seen him, my brother's seen 'em and my dog won't even run past those woods. I KNOW he's real.

Id: [0x00069C45]
Don't need to convince me. I believe in the headless horseman.

Id: [0x00069C47]
I was thinking we catch him, lock him up and charge two pence a peek.

Id: [0x00069C48]
You're having a laugh, mate. Cage up a bloody headless man on a horse?!

Id: [0x00069C4A]
It's like the pedestal back at the entrance... I'll need to come back with a power source.

Id: [0x00069C61]
I found the Headless Horseman. It pains me to tell you that the stories of his collection of human heads are no fables. But he was a man. A living man who lives no more. I saw to that.

Id: [0x00069D0B]
How's it, friend? You have the look of a hunter with that arsenal strapped to you. Tell you what though- real hunters out here trap their prey. More efficient. Cleaner. If you had a mind to test your hand at it, best spot's a few rods west of the river.

Id: [0x00069D0E]
Nice work. We've got two of these lodges that  belong to the New England Hunting Society. I got a spare journal on me if you want it- sort of a hunting log we use to compare progress.

Id: [0x00069D10]
Just tell us what you want!

Id: [0x00069D12]
Okay. I need a power source...

Id: [0x00069D1E]
Another pedestal...

Id: [0x00069D27]
Each recruit can carry one melee weapon and a pistol.

Id: [0x00069D28]
Return to the training menu, please.

Id: [0x00069D29]
Now select the gear menu.

Id: [0x00069D2B]
Just like with the weapons, you have to buy outfits in order to equip them.

Id: [0x00069D2D]
Okay - now I'll show you how contracts work. Let's start by opening up the recruit menu again.

Id: [0x00069D2F]
Now select the guild menu and choose "manage" and then "missions".

Id: [0x00069D32]
Navigate the map to see what's currently available.

Id: [0x00069D34]
When selecting a region, the map will show you if it's under Assassin or Templar control, the number of contracts available, and the difficulty rating for the region. The higher the difficulty rating, the stronger the Templar presence.

Id: [0x00069D35]
You'll be notified via the AFS window when a contract has been completed.

Id: [0x00069D37]
Completing contracts will weaken Templar influence in a region. This will provide your recruits with experience that can then be used to further train them.

Id: [0x00069D39]
Okay - that should cover everything there is to know about Assassin recruits. I'll let you get back to what you were doing.

Id: [0x00069D40]
[Enkonhrh√°:reke tsi nii√≥:re tensatonh√≥ntsohse aonsahsate'ni√©n:ten.]I will be waiting for you when you want to try again.

Id: [0x00069D70]
Feel free to try me again another time.

Id: [0x00069D75]
Hey Desmond. Seems like now's a good time to check out the animus menu. Do me a favor and pull it up.

Id: [0x00069D7A]
So now you've got a nice 2D topographical image of the region. Places you haven't visited yet will be fogged over - while those you've been to will be filled in.

Id: [0x00069D7C]
Icons on the map represent all kinds of things like points of interest, important people, and mission objectives. You can also set custom markers yourself.

Id: [0x00069D7E]
If things get a little too busy on screen, you can toggle filters to reduce the amount of information being shared.

Id: [0x00069D80]
If you're ever not sure what the icons on your map represent, pull up the legend.

Id: [0x00069D82]
Great! Now let's take a look at your inventory.

Id: [0x00069D86]
Items are divided up into different categories. Select a category to view the items inside it.

Id: [0x00069D87]
Selecting an individual item will provide detailed information about it.

Id: [0x00069D88]
Oh - one last thing. The amount of money you're carrying is displayed in the top right hand corner.

Id: [0x00069D8A]
Alright, that about covers it. Now you know how to access your map and inventory. I'll let you get back to what you were doing.

Id: [0x00069D91]
Come back anytime and I'll learn you again.

Id: [0x00069D97]
Fighters ready!? FIGHT!

Id: [0x00069D9A]
You're done.

Id: [0x00069DA1]
Hey Desmond. Now that Connor's recruited his first Assassin, I should show you how to put him to work. Let's start by opening up the recruit menu and choosing an ability.

Id: [0x00069DA3]
Now that you made your choice, you'll see it displayed on the screen. Try using it.

Id: [0x00069DA6]
Using a recruit's abilities will deplete your reserve of tokens. Different abilities have different costs. Don't worry, though - tokens replenish over time.

Id: [0x00069DA7]
One other thing - your recruits can be injured while in combat. If this happens, they will become temporarily unavailable while they heal.

Id: [0x00069DBD]
Hold on a second... I've got something you'll want to see. Can you bring up the map, please?

Id: [0x00069DC0]
Great! Now select the AVT filter. By the way - AVT stands for Assassins versus Templars.

Id: [0x00069DC2]
This filter displays the districts currently under Templar influence. You'll notice that the city has been divided up into districts. Move the cursor over a district to receive information on its current status.

Id: [0x00069DC4]
The map will also provide information on tasks you can perform to reduce Templar influence. Liberating a district provides all kinds of benefits.

Id: [0x00069DC6]
Okay - that's all for now!

Id: [0x00069DD6]
Ah. Good old notoriety. This is important, so you should pay attention.

Id: [0x00069DD8]
The notoriety meter measures - you guessed it - your notoriety. It's goes from zero - which means you're totally incognito - to three, which means everyone's looking for you. Generally speaking, lower is better.

Id: [0x00069DDA]
When the meter's red, it means you're either in open conflict, or being chased by enemies who have line of sight on you.

Id: [0x00069DDC]
When it's yellow, it means you're still being pursued, but line of sight has been broken.

Id: [0x00069DDE]
Remember: the less notorious you are, the easier your life... er, your ancestor's life, will be.

Id: [0x00069DF5]
Hi again, Desmond! Time to re-introduce you to the weapon wheel! Mind bringing it up?

Id: [0x00069DF9]
The wheel shows you what weapons you're currently carrying as well as any relevant ammunition counts.

Id: [0x00069DFA]
You can also assign your favorite weapons and tools to your quick-select inventory.

Id: [0x00069DFC]
If you just want to choose something manually - select it in the weapon wheel and then close the menu.

Id: [0x00069DFF]
Once you've chosen a weapon, it'll appear in the indicator in the lower right corner. Same goes for tools. You'll also see an ammo count when relevant.

Id: [0x00069E01]
Also, when you've got a pistol equipped, the HUD will display its reload state.

Id: [0x00069E03]
So there you have it - everything you ever wanted to know about selecting and equipping weapons!

Id: [0x00069E07]
Time to teach you all about quests! Do me a favor and bring up the Animus menu. Then select the quest log.

Id: [0x00069E0A]
You'll see quests come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Go ahead and flip through them.

Id: [0x00069E0C]
Highlighting a particular quest will display its details on the right side of the screen. You can review current objectives as well as your progress.

Id: [0x00069E0D]
Oh! One final tip. You can actually bring up a quest's location on the map by selecting it.

Id: [0x00069E0F]
There ya go! Happy hunting!

Id: [0x00069E13]
Everything alright, Desmond? You should really get moving. Sneaking past security should get you into the arena.

Id: [0x00069E15]
I really think pickpocketing a ticket is the way to go. I know it sucks for whoever you take it from... But it's a small price to pay seeing as you're saving the world and everything.

Id: [0x00069E17]
You gotta get in there Desmond. Whatever you do, do it soon, please.

Id: [0x00069E1A]
Careful Desmond... Security is looking for you. Try and stay blended with the crowd. Move too fast and you'll attract their attention. We can't have you getting arrested.

Id: [0x00069E1B]
Lotta security... make sure they don't see you. Blending with the crowd's your best bet.

Id: [0x00069E1C]
Stick with the crowd and security will never spot you.

Id: [0x00069E1D]
Hmmm... If you're worried about being spotted, there's probably a way around security.

Id: [0x00069E1E]
There's gotta be a way to slip past them... A side room, maybe? Hallway? Something?

Id: [0x00069E1F]
I'm telling you, there's definitely a way to get past those guards... If you won't go through 'em, try going around 'em.

Id: [0x00069E22]
Having trouble finding the catwalk? It should be close...

Id: [0x00069E23]
You should really get up on that catwalk before security shows up...

Id: [0x00069E24]
Don't tell me you're suddenly afraid of heights? You've got to cross the arena on that catwalk. It's the only way.

Id: [0x00069E26]
[Bilhete, por favor.]Ticket, please.

Id: [0x00069E28]
[Bilhete?]Ticket?

Id: [0x00069E2A]
[Preciso ver seu bilhete.]I need to see your ticket.

Id: [0x00069E2C]
[N√£o posso deixar entrar sem um bilhete.]Can't let you in without a ticket.

Id: [0x00069E2E]
[Certo. Pode entrar.]Okay. Go on in.

Id: [0x00069E30]
[Por favor, senhor?]Please, sir?

Id: [0x00069E32]
[N√£o tenho nada...]I have nothing...

Id: [0x00069E34]
[S√≥ alguns centavos...]Just a few centavos...

Id: [0x00069E36]
[Estou com fome...]I am hungry...

Id: [0x00069E39]
Look out!

Id: [0x00069E3A]
Security's headed towards you!

Id: [0x00069E3B]
Hide! Hide!

Id: [0x00069E3C]
Don't let them see you.

Id: [0x00069E3D]
Quick, Desmond! Hide or blend or... do something!

Id: [0x00069E3E]
Abstergo agents! Don't let them see you.

Id: [0x00069F12]
Alright! We're up and running. [aside]This code is hacked to all hell- nicely hacked but hacked. The worm found three pivots before failing, so we've got those. You need to locate the remaining pivots on your own from inside. The three we've got will triangulate the rest. It's a sweet bit of hacking on my part if I dare say- each pivot detects the others in proximity. There should be twelve total. Every one you find is supposed to produce a hex cipher and that's what we're after. Once you find them all, we'll sequence the code, package the data and Bob's your uncle. Now, don't putz around too much in revolutionary America- I know it's tempting.

Id: [0x00069F3A]
Holy crap. We did it. It's done. His data is uploading to the cloud! HAHAHAHAHAHA! Vegas baby! Vegas!

Id: [0x00069FF6]
Hold up just a second Desmond. I need to show you the progress tracker. Open it up, please.

Id: [0x00069FF8]
So the progress tracker basically visualizes how in sync you are with your ancestor.

Id: [0x00069FFA]
From this zoomed our perspective, you can browse through the various categories and see your overall progression. Give it a shot.

Id: [0x00069FFD]
When you highlight a category you'll see a bar in the upper right of the screen. This is the Sync Bar. Finishing missions, completing constraints, and performing various other activities will fill it up. Filling the bar improves your synchronization, providing all kinds of benefits.

Id: [0x00069FFF]
Okay! Now let's zoom in on a specific category.

Id: [0x0006A002]
This view lets you browse through the specific tasks inside a category.

Id: [0x0006A004]
Highlighting a task provides detailed information on what you need to do. As with the sync bar, filling a column unlocks perks.

Id: [0x0006A006]
One last thing: Some tasks are linked to tasks in other columns.

Id: [0x0006A008]
Completing these interconnected tasks will open up even more bonuses.

Id: [0x0006A00A]
So there you have it - the progress tracker in all its glory! I'll let you get back to what you were doing.

Id: [0x0006A00C]
Now go ahead and choose "upgrade".

Id: [0x0006A00E]
Now select the guild menu and choose "manage trainees" and then "missions".

Id: [0x0006AA38]
[Th√≥:ner wahrenn√°kerate.]And then he entered the world.

Id: [0x0006AA3A]
[Teshiati√©:ren ne ro‚Äôn√≠ha, nek tsi iah tehonwaia‚Äôtanekh√©:ren √°se‚Äôken tetsatiati√©:ren √≥:ni.]He had his father's features, but enough of me that he did not appear a stranger.

Id: [0x0006AA3B]
[Nek tsi iah oth√©:nen tekarihw√°stahkwe.]In the end it mattered little.

Id: [0x0006AA3C]
[Akonkwe‚Äôta‚Äôsh√≤n:‚Äôa wahonwan√≥:ronhkwe tsi n√≠:ioht ne shakotiien‚Äôok√≤n:‚Äôa.]My people loved him as their own.

Id: [0x0006AA3E]
[Nek tsi s√©nha waharihwanont√≥nnion tsi rotehiahr√≥ntie.]But as he grew, so too did his questions.

Id: [0x0006AA3F]
[√ìnhka ne ro‚Äôn√≠ha? Oh nonti√©:ren tsi √©:ren w√†:rehte?]Who was father? Why did he leave?

Id: [0x0006AA40]
[Sk√©n:nen t√°non‚Äô t√≥:kenske tsi n√≠:ioht tsi wa‚Äôtkerihwa‚Äôser√°:ko.]I answered each simply and honestly.

Id: [0x0006AA41]
[Rater√≠:ios ‚Äì hen Ro‚Äônikonhratsh√†:ni, nek tsi iah tehotennitenr√°htskon ‚Äì]He was a warrior - brave yes, but ruthless -

Id: [0x0006AA42]
[Rote‚Äônikonhr√≠son ne aho‚Äôshatstenhserowan√©nhake, aroh√°tien oh n√≠:ioht.]- dedicated to the pursuit of power, no matter the cost.

Id: [0x0006AD7D]
How dare you call upon me after Monmouth?

Id: [0x0006AD7E]
I have nobody else to turn to. The Culper Ring informed me that Westpoint's been infiltrated. I believe they intend to murder Major General Benedict Arnold.

Id: [0x0006AD7F]
I still do not see why you need me.

Id: [0x0006AD80]
It must be done without my soldiers' knowledge. The mere idea of the Patriots being breached would be crippling to morale, to the war. Will you do it?

What in God's name are you doing?!

Id: [0x0006AD8C]
That man was a British spy. He intended to kill you, Major Arnold.

Id: [0x0006AD8D]
What?!

General Washington learned of the plot and sent me to foil it.

Id: [0x0006AF6F]
The slow fever took them. And what did I do? Only watch and wish to join. Nearly did, in fact. But I proved too great a coward. I could take the lives of others without hesitation - but when it came time to claim my own? Then I faltered... Pathetic.

Id: [0x0006AF71]
Are there no Assassins left in the colonies beyond us?

Id: [0x0006AF72]
Listen to you: us. There are NO Assassins anymore, boy. I'm an old man - beaten and resigned. You're an upstart who dreams of glory but lacks the skill and experience.

Id: [0x0006AF73]
What happened to them?

Id: [0x0006AF74]
Your father.

Id: [0x0006AF75]
Explain.

Id: [0x0006AF76]
What's to explain? He and the other Templars hunted us to the last man.

Id: [0x0006AF77]
But he spared you... Why?

Id: [0x0006AF7A]
I'll not reopen old wounds. Let us speak of other things...

Id: [0x0006B060]
Oi, lad! How is it going then?

Id: [0x0006B061]
I am well. And you?

Id: [0x0006B062]
Oh, can't complain. [pause]There was something I've been meaning to tell you...

Id: [0x0006B069]
How are you faring?

Id: [0x0006B06A]
Not bad, not bad. All this reminds me of being back in the Old Country. Fightin' for land, fightin' for the right to see God my way. Didn't take long before I realized the fight was futile and stepped aboard a ship bound for the Colonies. People over there are so wrapped up in HOW you perceive the Lord they forget we're all part of his flock. Stories change, Connor. The way people tell them evolves. It's no different in the Bible and I believe that's the real root of all the strife back home. But nobody wants to listen to me- if you don't see it their way you're a heathen. But I feel we're honestly making a difference here. That our presence is felt if not appreciated by all. Ah! And it makes me sleep easy at night and that's all a man can ask for really.

Id: [0x0006B06B]
I would like to visit your home country some day.

Id: [0x0006B06C]
Oh, would you now? You'd turn a head or two on the Emerald Isle, I'll tell you that. Maybe one day I'll muster up the courage, go back and I'll bring you with me- would be good for a laugh at any rate!

Id: [0x0006B06E]
Stephane. How is your ale?

Id: [0x0006B06F]
Pisse (Piss), but it gets the job done- my father would be disgusted- but after a day's work with you a man needs to unwind. I would prefer a nice bottle of wine but these Colonies lack refinement.

Id: [0x0006B072]
Tell the story again. You know, the one I like. The one about the bear.

Id: [0x0006B073]
Ah, yes. The bear, right. You like that one. Well. [drinks]That was some time ago, dans l'Acadie (in Acadia). I had a horse, Roulette, a real beauty! Tall, fast and sleek! I loved that horse, bought her from a hump-back. A strange little man who seemed to know everything. He promised me that I would not regret the purchase, and he spoke the truth, although seven dollars was my entire fortune. The purchase made me a pauper! But I assure you, it was a bargain. A bargain at the price!

Id: [0x0006B074]
And she'd just foaled, don't forget that part.

Id: [0x0006B075]
Yes.  Yes, bon (good). I was getting to that. She was with her four-day-old foal, Beau. Frisky. [drinks]Still learning to run. Very unsteady on his legs. Quite charming, really.  A little run, then nervous, back to maman (mom), then another little run...

Id: [0x0006B076]
Norris! The bear!

Id: [0x0006B077]
Of course. Roulette and Beau were in the pen, and I was across the field examining the soil. I had found some iron ore and I was excited. But! There was a bear I had not seen. The horses sensed the bear and became skittish. I did not notice, because the foal was skittish anyway. But the bear attacked and broke into the pen. I ran to save them, to save my horses! The bear saw me and charged! Well, I charged back! We crashed into each other and when I woke up, the bear was still out!

Id: [0x0006B079]
I do not know whether I should even tell you, but it's got me all confused and I have to tell someone.

Id: [0x0006B07B]
Tell me - how did you learn to speak English so well?

Id: [0x0006B07C]
My mother insisted on teaching me. Claimed I would have need of it one day. I wonder if she knew what was to come.

Id: [0x0006B07D]
She was never one to leave things to chance. By arming you with this knowledge she ensured your success... Or the potential for it, anyway.

Id: [0x0006B080]
Are you lonely?

Id: [0x0006B081]
Excuse me?

Id: [0x0006B082]
I asked if you were lonely.

Id: [0x0006B083]
I wasn't being literal when I -- oh, never mind. But to answer your question: no. I'm quite content by myself, in fact.

Id: [0x0006B084]
But you weren't always alone. Don't you miss what once was?

Id: [0x0006B085]
My God, boy - have you no filter? Do you not realize that your words wound?

Id: [0x0006B086]
I am sorry... I was taught to speak my mind plainly. It seems you colonists prefer to hide. But what good can come of such deceptions?

Id: [0x0006B087]
It's not deception, but decorum. Manners. And it seems you're in desperate need of some.

Id: [0x0006B088]
I did not mean to offend.

Id: [0x0006B089]
And yet you did. Think on that.

Id: [0x0006B0C0]
I love that story.

Id: [0x0006B0C4]
Your father?

Id: [0x0006B0C5]
Mon p√®re. (my dad) He was a great man. A cook in the French Army during the Seven Years War. He marched all across the white North, feeding Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and his officers. Cooking them feasts from sticks and berries. When the Commander-in-Chief opted for open conflict over manning the battlements of Quebec, every man was called to arms- including my father. He died on the field. But I'm told he fought ferociously. It matters little. He's gone now.

Id: [0x0006B0C6]
He would be proud of you.

Id: [0x0006B0C7]
This is my one hope- that he smiles upon the choices I've made.

Id: [0x0006B0E1]
Get back here with that, you rogue!

Id: [0x0006B0E4]
Are you touched in the head?

Id: [0x0006B0E5]
Diio?

Id: [0x0006B0E6]
Ziio.

Id: [0x0006B0E7]
Ziio.

Id: [0x0006B0E8]
Now, tell me why it is you're here.

Id: [0x0006B0EA]
Damned sprigs! This accursed city will be the death of me...

Id: [0x0006B0EC]
So I've planted two of our pivots, not easy from my end, believe you me, but there they are. You can see those two activating a buried one...kinda. If you drop the third one we have, the buried pivot's precise location should resolve. Then go gather the hex cipher, rinse, and repeat. If you get a chance I'd love to see Franklin's Glass Harmonica in person...just a side note. Have fun!

Id: [0x0006B0EE]
Awesome.

Id: [0x0006B0F5]
Boston's quite a lively city.

Id: [0x0006B0F6]
There's all manner of things to see and do. Once you've settled in, I suggest you take some time to walk the streets. Who knows what opportunities you might discover...

Id: [0x0006B0F8]
You seem troubled, friend.

Id: [0x0006B0F9]
That's because I am. Greatly so, in fact.

Id: [0x0006B0FA]
What's happened?

Id: [0x0006B0FB]
I was robbed. The old bulk and file... And though I've managed to restore what's mine, I fear it's ruined.

Id: [0x0006B0FC]
You mean, the book?

Id: [0x0006B0FD]
This is no ordinary book! It's an Almanac. The first I ever wrote.

Id: [0x0006B0FF]
Benjamin Franklin. Pleased to meet you.

Id: [0x0006B101]
Haytham Kenway.

Id: [0x0006B102]
You must be new to Boston.

Id: [0x0006B103]
Why do you say that?

Id: [0x0006B104]
You're still possessed of virtue. To stop and help an old lout like myself...

Id: [0x0006B106]
I.. I don't mean to impose, but... you seem a spry fellow. Should you happen to find my missing pages, I'll reward you.

Id: [0x0006B108]
Look, I'm not sure if I...

Id: [0x0006B10A]
It's alright, alright.  If you have the time, hurrah. If not - no harm done. The thing is useless in its current state anyway. But should you somehow manage to restore it, you'll find me inside that general store over there.

Id: [0x0006B10C]
Well that was interesting...

Id: [0x0006B5AB]
Connor! Do you have time to sit?

Id: [0x0006B5AC]
I do.

Id: [0x0006B5AD]
Good! I have been meaning to ask you, how did you come to all this?

Id: [0x0006B5AE]
I did not ask for it, but I feel it was meant to happen. I was just a boy when I met Achilles. He made me a warrior.

Id: [0x0006B5AF]
That easy? I miss the kitchen if you can believe it. I had more control in that world than I ever will in the one we inhabit. But more people get to taste the fruit of my labor in this line of work and for that I am satisfied.

Id: [0x0006B5B0]
We may change things yet, if we press on.

Id: [0x0006B5B1]
Frenchmen from the North never grow weary, just ask the women! Ha!

Id: [0x0006B5B4]
You do not partake?

Id: [0x0006B5B5]
No, sir. I need to stay sharp in case you call upon my rifle. Spirits do me in right quick. Drank half a flask of rum out in the bush with my brothers a few years back. Went for a run in the buff before I found myself rolling around in deer skat being sick all over. I don't want to go there again. No thank you.

Id: [0x0006B5B6]
A smart choice given the circumstances.

Id: [0x0006B5B7]
I want to fight like you someday.

Id: [0x0006B5B8]
You have everything it takes to be a great Assassin.

Id: [0x0006B5B9]
That means something coming from you.

Id: [0x0006B5BC]
Where did you learn to shoot like you do?

Id: [0x0006B5BD]
Ranging with my dad and brothers in Virginia country. My family's been surveying and prospecting out there since my grand-pappy.

Id: [0x0006B5BE]
How did you end up here.

Id: [0x0006B5BF]
I'm the youngest of four brothers. I was always gonna be a runner up with them so I set off alone to do my own business. Out west of Ohio's territory that no man of the Colonies' ever trodden. Figured I could find contracts out of New York. Then the war started.

Id: [0x0006B5C0]
And you sided with the Patriots.

Id: [0x0006B5C1]
Not really. My family's for the King. I just don't like seeing boys forced to fight against their will is all. But I know that I want to be free, for all to be free. If that means I'm a Patriot, I guess I am.

Id: [0x0006B5C4]
Thirsty I take it?

Id: [0x0006B5C5]
What's wrong with taking a draught or two when the time's right?

Id: [0x0006B5C6]
Nothing, Jamie, nothing.

Id: [0x0006B5C7]
Then why don't you join me then?

Id: [0x0006B5C8]
Not right now, maybe later.

Id: [0x0006B5C9]
I suppose you got important business to attend to. I understand. Don't worry about me though, I can handle my booze. If you need me, I'll be there, Connor.

Id: [0x0006B5CC]
Hey Connor.

Id: [0x0006B5CD]
Taking it easy today?

Id: [0x0006B5CE]
Things got a little out of hand the last time you saw me. Keeping an even keel.

Id: [0x0006B5CF]
Good. Where are you from?

Id: [0x0006B5D0]
Here. Born and raised but I'm a mutt if that's what you're really asking. Think I even got a little of the far East in my blood. That's what my father said, wherever that bastard got off to.

Id: [0x0006B5D3]
What about your mother?

Id: [0x0006B5D4]
She's down south. Haven't seen her in five years or so. She works on a plantation- keeping care of the slaves. Pff. Slaves. That's why I left. Can't support that business. Owning a human isn't something any man should do. She doesn't agree so I leave her to it. I make my life up here now. I'm an Assassin. This is my family.

Id: [0x0006B5D5]
Ah! Connor! Sit! Sit!

Id: [0x0006B5D6]
How are you Jacob?

Id: [0x0006B5D7]
Missing the beer gardens back home- but I am well.

Id: [0x0006B5D8]
How did you arrive in the colonies?

Id: [0x0006B5D9]
Like most other men like me. The Army. I was a Hessian for a time. It was a good job while I had it. I only felt it was time for something different once I arrive. Not long after I am meeting you so it seems my feeling was useful, no?

Id: [0x0006B5DA]
Certainly.

Id: [0x0006B5DB]
I am hoping to send for my family when the time is right. But we are fighting a war of our own, and I will not put them at risk.

Id: [0x0006B5DC]
Hopefully things will die down soon.

Id: [0x0006B5DD]
No rush, Connor. I am in their hearts and they are in mine.

Id: [0x0006B5E0]
I received a letter from home.

Id: [0x0006B5E1]
What news?

Id: [0x0006B5E2]
My son is the strongest boy in our village. Standing tall and proud. My heart grows heavy for them, now and my patience wanes for bringing them across the ocean. I have sent money for passage. War or no war.

Id: [0x0006B64F]
What? You can tell me.

Id: [0x0006B650]
Well, there is a gentleman who has been coming to the shop. I think just to see me!

Id: [0x0006B651]
A gentleman?

Id: [0x0006B652]
He comes by quite often.

Id: [0x0006B653]
And do you like that?

Id: [0x0006B654]
Yes! I do not know what to do about it. I mean, his company is very pleasant.

Id: [0x0006B655]
You must be cautious, Ellen. A woman's reputation is of such importance. It's almost impossible to recover once lost. Does he consider such things?

Id: [0x0006B656]
Ellen! Someone might hear.

Id: [0x0006B659]
Yes! Back spindles are solid! Nice robust feel to it. Good work with the planer, too. Well, let's have a sit. [chair collapses]Ah! Oof! Ridiculous! A pile of trash! I knew that wood was rot-ridden! Well. It's firewood now.

Id: [0x0006B65B]
Very well.  I feel good about this one. Well joined... a bit of a burl there on the spindle. Well, let's see how it sits. [sits down]Ahhh! That, if I may say, is a chair! Good balance. Solid. No squeaks. Yes, I could sit here happily for quite some time. Good work indeed.

Id: [0x0006B65D]
Oh, Oliver, you handsome husband!

Id: [0x0006B65E]
Corrine, there's a customer! ... I'll be right back.

Id: [0x0006B662]
I see you! I see you! I'll... Now where on earth...? Where...? Hmm.

Id: [0x0006B664]
There you are! Where'd he...? Ha! Quick little thing. Shoo! Shoo!

Id: [0x0006B666]
All right, let's see here. Did I get all the pine?

Id: [0x0006B667]
Uh, four, eight, mm. Aye! It's all here.

Id: [0x0006B67D]
We're headed to the Customs House to toss some quipps at the lobsters!

Id: [0x0006B67F]
With me! To King Street! We'll show 'em!

Id: [0x0006B681]
Everyone! Come with us! We've had enough!

Id: [0x0006B683]
There's some fun at the Customs House. Bring your cudgel.

Id: [0x0006B685]
The soldiers don't own this town! They don't belong here!

Id: [0x0006B687]
Soldier on King Street knocked little Eddie Garrick on the head!

Id: [0x0006B689]
The soldiers are knocking people about. We're going to stop it!

Id: [0x0006B68B]
We didn't invite these soldiers! They've no business here!

Id: [0x0006B68D]
Redcoats everywhere you turn! No more!

Id: [0x0006B68F]
James! Sam! Come on! We're going to ruffle some redback feathers!

Id: [0x0006B691]
Down to the Customs House for a spree! Come on!

Id: [0x0006B693]
Rag tag and riff raff, come with me!

Id: [0x0006B696]
Come on, ya gotch-gutted coward! Ya dasn't shoot at me!

Id: [0x0006B698]
Hey, lobster! Go ahead, fire your little gun!

Id: [0x0006B69A]
What? Afeard of some lawful citizens?

Id: [0x0006B69C]
You red-backed, rum-soaked, bacon-faced lout! I'd as soon fight ya as piss on ya!

Id: [0x0006B69E]
You reeky swad! Take a swing at me, why don't ya?

Id: [0x0006B6A0]
You've got a bayonet, do ya? I'll use you for a pin-cushion!

Id: [0x0006B6A2]
A little worried, are you? Too many people? You might want to consider leavin'!

Id: [0x0006B6A4]
Stand down, or I'll have you by your tallywags and I'll not let go!

Id: [0x0006B6A6]
I will null you into a pudding!

Id: [0x0006B6A8]
Good. And the birch?

Id: [0x0006B6A9]
Well, this whole section.

Id: [0x0006B6AA]
That should be right. Fine. And did Terry bring the planks of maple?

Id: [0x0006B6AB]
I haven't seen Terry.

Id: [0x0006B6AC]
Haven't seen Terry! Where has he gone to?

Id: [0x0006B6AD]
I'm sure he'll be along.

Id: [0x0006B6AE]
Very well. We'll mark that as undelivered until he arrives.

Id: [0x0006B6B3]
Good Evening, sir. This way, please.

Id: [0x0006B6B5]
To my way of thinkin', a man's got to leave the past behind.

Id: [0x0006B6B7]
I've got a bit of stage fright!

Id: [0x0006B6B8]
A little dutch courage'll put a bloom in your cheek.

Id: [0x0006B6BA]
Jeremy's really burning up the boards tonight!

Id: [0x0006B6BB]
He's a marvel.

Id: [0x0006B6BD]
I'm very keen to see tonight's performance!

Id: [0x0006B6BF]
I'm told the story is quite scandalous!

Id: [0x0006B6C1]
You're looking lovely this evening, my dear.

Id: [0x0006B6C2]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0006B6C4]
Who's playing Peachum?

Id: [0x0006B6C7]
The stage side balcony! Hurry!

Id: [0x0006B6C9]
Calm, please!

Id: [0x0006B6CC]
Whatever has happened?

Id: [0x0006B6CD]
A man was killed in the upper balconies!

Id: [0x0006B6CE]
Oh, my!

Id: [0x0006B6D0]
No pushing, please!

Id: [0x0006B6D2]
I thought it was part of the performance!

Id: [0x0006B6D4]
Did they find the killer?

Id: [0x0006B6D6]
They don't know who did it.

Id: [0x0006B6D8]
At an opera!

Id: [0x0006B6DA]
Be careful!

Id: [0x0006B6DC]
Let us out!

Id: [0x0006B6DE]
I can't get out of here fast enough.

Id: [0x0006B6E1]
I'm sorry. The corridor is blocked. Patience please!

Id: [0x0006B6E3]
Let us through!

Id: [0x0006B6E4]
A man was killed up there!

Id: [0x0006B6E7]
It happened right in that balcony!

Id: [0x0006B6E8]
What are those men doing in there?

Id: [0x0006B6EB]
We must leave at once!

Id: [0x0006B6EC]
There's a killer about! I'm staying where it's safe!

Id: [0x0006B6EE]
Hey!

Id: [0x0006B6EF]
Imbecile!

Id: [0x0006B6F2]
Aah! Oh! Ouch!

Id: [0x0006B6F4]
Oh, dear. Help him, Henry.

Id: [0x0006B6F5]
Here you go, my good man.

Id: [0x0006B6F8]
That man, there! Seize him!

Id: [0x0006B6F9]
But I've done no wrong! I swear it!

Id: [0x0006B6FA]
Search him. Any weapons?

Id: [0x0006B6FB]
Nothing. We must keep looking. He must be in here somewhere!

Id: [0x0006B6FE]
I beg your pardon, Madame. Did you notice anyone suspicious coming from that booth, there?

Id: [0x0006B700]
No. I don't think so...

Id: [0x0006B701]
Are you certain? Try to remember.

Id: [0x0006B704]
Where are you going?

Id: [0x0006B705]
I need to get out! It's too close in here! I must get some air!

Id: [0x0006B706]
Calm yourself! I won't let you go until you're calm!

Id: [0x0006B709]
I'll search along here, you search down there.

Id: [0x0006B70A]
Very well. If you find anyone, give a shout.

Id: [0x0006B719]
Stand tall men! We're holding!

Id: [0x0006B71B]
Come on! It's yours to take! Naught but a handful of recruits remain! Cowards!

Id: [0x0006B71E]
All right, Doctor, if you don't mind. If you could just lift your arms? Yes, straight out, please.

Id: [0x0006B71F]
Like so?

Id: [0x0006B720]
Yes, thanks... length of the arm... and here... And now, if I could trouble you, I am worried about the trousers being too tight around your calf. If I may... Yes. That should be all right then... And once more, arms out.

Id: [0x0006B721]
Of course.

Id: [0x0006B722]
Just here... and, arms out, and around...

Id: [0x0006B723]
Oh, my!

Id: [0x0006B724]
I believe I have everything. Just let me write those down...

Id: [0x0006B725]
How long before this will be ready?

Id: [0x0006B726]
Three weeks.

Id: [0x0006B727]
Good.

Id: [0x0006B728]
That is all. Thank you very much, Doctor.

Id: [0x0006B729]
Good day.

Id: [0x0006B72A]
Good-bye.

Id: [0x0006B791]
Hello again!

Id: [0x0006B792]
More Almanac pages?

Id: [0x0006B793]
Not quite. It's a treatise, actually.

Id: [0x0006B794]
Oh? Concerning what?

Id: [0x0006B795]
The benefits of taking an older woman as a lover.

Id: [0x0006B796]
You make a compelling argument, Mister Franklin. I might just have to run a few tests myself.

Id: [0x0006B797]
I highly recommend it!

Id: [0x0006B79A]
Really? This, I‚Äôd like to hear.

Id: [0x0006B79B]
First and most obvious ‚Äì they‚Äôre wiser. And so this makes for far more stimulating conversation. Makes other things more stimulating as well. But more on that in a moment.

Id: [0x0006B79C]
Alright. Your argument for experience makes some sense.

Id: [0x0006B79D]
Second, when beauty fades, women must improve their utility ‚Äì lest they be discarded and forgotten. Rare is an old woman who is not also kind, compassionate, and good.

Id: [0x0006B79E]
That‚Äôs something of a generalization.

Id: [0x0006B79F]
But also true. Now onto the third! Older women cannot conceive! Which means one less thing over which to fret. In fact, you also decrease the chance of acquiring something like the French Pox ‚Äì its presence clearly visible ‚Äì or the woman dead.

Id: [0x0006B7A0]
And should one desire a child?

Id: [0x0006B7A1]
Then make a young woman your wife. Let the older one be a mistress. And that brings me to my fourth point: With age comes prudence. An older woman is less likely to reveal your indiscretions.

Id: [0x0006B7A2]
Yes. I suppose you know quite a bit about that.

Id: [0x0006B7A3]
And proud of it, thank you! As to the fifth reason: Because in every animal that walks upright, the deficiency of the fluids that fill the muscles appears first in the highest part: the face first grows lank and wrinkled; then the neck; then the breast and arms; the lower parts continuing to the last as plump as ever: So that covering all above with a basket, and regarding only what is below the girdle, it is impossible of two women to know an old from a young one. And as in the dark all cats are grey, the pleasure of corporal enjoyment with an old Woman is at least equal, and frequently superior, every knack being by practice capable of improvement.

Id: [0x0006B7A5]
You mad bastard!

Id: [0x0006B7A6]
Well it‚Äôs true. And believe me, I should know ‚Äì I‚Äôve sampled a great many. You should try one as well! Like a fine wine, they only improve with age. Although... I suppose if left unattended too long, some have a tendency to sour. And that, my friend, is a most unpleasant experience. Better to work in a field often plowed, you know?

Id: [0x0006B7A8]
Is there more?

Id: [0x0006B7A9]
Indeed, indeed. The sixth is this: the sin is less. To take a maidenhead is a great responsibility. Mishandled, it can ruin lives. No such risk with an older woman. And this implies the seventh: younger women are more given to compunction. Anxiety and unease are not present in the more aged and experienced. And as to the last of my reasons. Well, it‚Äôs really quite simple. Older women are so very grateful for the attention.

Id: [0x0006B7AB]
Enough! Go home! Go to sleep!

Id: [0x0006B7AC]
Tomorrow-is-the-day when we maun-ride-away!

Id: [0x0006B7AD]
Good-bye tae the lass of Fyvie!

Id: [0x0006B7AF]
I owe you a great thanks, by the way.

Id: [0x0006B7B0]
What for?

Id: [0x0006B7B1]
Speaking with me. You see, I have very few friends in Boston these days.

Id: [0x0006B7B2]
And what did you do to earn their ire?

Id: [0x0006B7B3]
Started with a cartoon I drew, suggesting unification. How else can we hope to withstand the French menace? I proposed something similar at the Albany Conference as well... and it ruffled quite a few feathers.

Id: [0x0006B7B5]
See, I've begun to wonder if Parliament best serves our interests. The colonies might be better off independent and autonomous. Most of my peers, however, haven't taken kindly to the suggestion...

Id: [0x0006B7B7]
Are things truly so bad under the Crown?

Id: [0x0006B7B8]
But you've answered your own question! Under! Why under? It should be side-by-side! Does France reside beneath Britain? Do the Italians? The Prussians? The Spanish? No! Oh, sure - they may disagree from time to time - even come to blows. But they stand on equal ground. And we should as well!

Id: [0x0006B7BC]
Hmmm. I suppose it's only natural to desire parity. We leave behind our parents - our childhoods - our homes - and seek to find a place in the world. If it's true for a person, why not a nation?

Id: [0x0006B7BE]
Yes! Yes! Exactly!

Id: [0x0006B7C0]
Bit of a cough, eh? Could you sit up very straight? ... There we are. And breathe in. And out. And in. No problem there.

Id: [0x0006B7C1]
It is just now and then. A catch in the throat.

Id: [0x0006B7C2]
Let me have a listen here at the back.

Id: [0x0006B7C3]
The same?

Id: [0x0006B7C4]
Yes. Up straight and breathe in. And out. In. Well, Ellen, nothing seems to be amiss.  Hm. I recommend a puff or two of tobacco, and you should be fine. All right?

Id: [0x0006B7C5]
Thank you, Doctor White.

Id: [0x0006B7C6]
Are the colonies not simply an extension of the kingdom, though? Another... borough, if you will?

Id: [0x0006B7C7]
No. We are not. We've evolved into something else. Something... distinct.

Id: [0x0006B7C8]
Hmmm...Interesting...

Id: [0x0006B7C9]
Anyway, I've taken up enough of your time. Please - don't let me keep you from your work.

Id: [0x0006B7CB]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x0006B7CC]
Hmmph!

Id: [0x0006B7CD]
Mph!

Id: [0x0006B7CE]
Mh!

Id: [0x0006B7CF]
Whup.

Id: [0x0006B7D0]
Hm.

Id: [0x0006B7D1]
Uh-huh.

Id: [0x0006B7D2]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006B7DD]
Still here, are you?

Id: [0x0006B7DE]
I was just wondering... What happens now?

Id: [0x0006B7DF]
There's quite a lot to do. Commander Washington must determine when and where we'll strike next. And we need to get to work on our message.

Id: [0x0006B7E0]
Message?

Id: [0x0006B7E1]
We must contact the broadsheets at once - ensure it's clear to everyone that it was the Loyalists who fired first in Lexington.

Id: [0x0006B7E2]
But no one knows who fired first...

Id: [0x0006B7E3]
Which is exactly why we must spread the news quickly. We'll determine public opinion.

Id: [0x0006B7E4]
This seems... dishonest.

Id: [0x0006B7E5]
Perhaps. But so what? People must believe we acted in self-defense. Else, we've committed treason.

Id: [0x0006B7E6]
But you have.

Id: [0x0006B7E7]
Better to bow and scrape before a tyrant then? Is that what you suggest?

Id: [0x0006B7E8]
No of course not. No one should be denied freedom. And yet... To change the truth... It seems a dangerous road to travel.

Id: [0x0006B7E9]
Understand, Connor, this is a war fought not just on the battlefield, but within hearts and minds as well. There's nothing wrong with a bit of theater - especially if it saves lives.

Id: [0x0006B7EB]
Here we are. Best to continue on foot...

Id: [0x0006B7EF]
I suggest we leave the horse here. We can return for her when we're done.

Id: [0x0006B7F1]
Let us continue the search on foot...

Id: [0x0006B7F3]
We should dismount for this. It'll be quicker and quieter.

Id: [0x0006B7F5]
Might be safer if we approach the houses on foot.

Id: [0x0006B807]
It's good and sharp now.

Id: [0x0006B809]
But don't over-do it.

Id: [0x0006B80A]
Don't worry.

Id: [0x0006B80C]
Have a look.

Id: [0x0006B80D]
Hmm. Yes, but, it's a little... you know.

Id: [0x0006B80E]
Let me straighten the edge.

Id: [0x0006B810]
It's coming along fine.

Id: [0x0006B812]
It won't chip easy, will it?

Id: [0x0006B813]
No, no. Don't worry.

Id: [0x0006B815]
How about now?

Id: [0x0006B816]
It's good work, but it's still a little...

Id: [0x0006B817]
I'll take care of it.

Id: [0x0006B819]
Oh, it's a beautiful axe.

Id: [0x0006B81A]
It sure is.

Id: [0x0006B81B]
I just want it to be even.

Id: [0x0006B81C]
A good, straight edge. Good and straight.

Id: [0x0006B81E]
I'll do this tout de suite (right away).

Id: [0x0006B820]
Attends! Attends! (Wait! Wait!) Not too much on one side.

Id: [0x0006B821]
It's all right, it's all right.

Id: [0x0006B823]
Have a look.

Id: [0x0006B824]
Yes, very nice. But sharper! Please.

Id: [0x0006B825]
Of course... a little sharper...

Id: [0x0006B827]
But straight, too, yes? Keep it straight.

Id: [0x0006B828]
It's straight. Sharp and straight.

Id: [0x0006B82A]
Take a look.

Id: [0x0006B82B]
Yes. That's nice. Very nice. Just one last run.

Id: [0x0006B82C]
All right. A little more.

Id: [0x0006B8A0]
That's good.

Id: [0x0006B8A1]
And over there.

Id: [0x0006B8A2]
And this section.

Id: [0x0006B8A3]
This area is sagging a bit... Could you, could you just bring the light down here?

Id: [0x0006B8A4]
Yes. Very good.

Id: [0x0006B8A5]
We've done a fine bit of work there.

Id: [0x0006B8A6]
This will hold for many years.

Id: [0x0006B8A7]
Yes. Quite right.

Id: [0x0006B8A8]
It makes me a bit thirsty.

Id: [0x0006B8A9]
Swinging a hammer is thirsty work.

Id: [0x0006B8AA]
Haha, tr√®s bien (very good). We deserve a small drink, mon ami (my friend).

Id: [0x0006B8AC]
True, true. Thing is...

Id: [0x0006B8AF]
Oh, Godfrey!

Id: [0x0006B8B0]
My bonnie Kate!

Id: [0x0006B8B2]
But I've work to be doin', lassie.

Id: [0x0006B8B3]
Later, then.

Id: [0x0006B8B6]
Ready the crew, Mister Faulkner. We sail for Chesapeake Bay.

Id: [0x0006B8B7]
Form up! Form up!

Id: [0x0006B8B9]
Push them back!

Id: [0x0006B8BB]
Rally to the flag! To me!

Id: [0x0006B8BE]
Arnold has made it to the Vulture!

Id: [0x0006B8BF]
We must hold the fort!

Id: [0x0006B8C0]
Keep running ya lechers! Ha! We did it! Well done!

Id: [0x0006B8C4]
Let us out? Please? We done nothing wrong!

Id: [0x0006B8C6]
Come on mate! Let us fight! You need us!

Id: [0x0006B8C8]
You here to release us! Let us help you hold this place.

Id: [0x0006B8F8]
All right, lad. Pass 'em on up.

Id: [0x0006B8F9]
There y'are.

Id: [0x0006B8FA]
And another.

Id: [0x0006B8FC]
What is it?

Id: [0x0006B8FD]
I was just thinking.

Id: [0x0006B8FE]
Aye?

Id: [0x0006B8FF]
We have to load these all up, take 'em to Big Dave, and then we have to unload 'em.

Id: [0x0006B900]
That's right.

Id: [0x0006B901]
After all that, it'll be long past time to eat!

Id: [0x0006B902]
Best hurry, then.

Id: [0x0006B903]
Right.

Id: [0x0006B905]
And another one.

Id: [0x0006B907]
What now?

Id: [0x0006B908]
I'm thirsty.

Id: [0x0006B909]
Well, have a drink.

Id: [0x0006B90A]
Good plan.

Id: [0x0006B90C]
Is there enough for me?

Id: [0x0006B90D]
Of course. Have a belly full.

Id: [0x0006B90E]
Thank ye.

Id: [0x0006B916]
Right.

Id: [0x0006B918]
Any chance at all we'll be done in time for supper?

Id: [0x0006B919]
Not if we donnae get to work, lad.

Id: [0x0006B91A]
Right.

Id: [0x0006B91C]
Here you go.

Id: [0x0006B91D]
Last one.

Id: [0x0006B91E]
Not as long as we thought, eh?

Id: [0x0006B945]
That is a nasty cough. Let's have a listen, shall we?

Id: [0x0006B946]
Breathe in. And out. And in. Hm. That is a concern.

Id: [0x0006B947]
Could be very serious. Very serious indeed. Or it could be nothing at all. A little rum in the evening should do the trick.

Id: [0x0006B95C]
Would you like a draught of ale or some bread and cheese?

Id: [0x0006B95D]
Connor!  This here is Oliver and that is Corrine. Great people! Ollie! This is Connor, the man I was talking about. The LORD of the manor!

Id: [0x0006B988]
What? Am I all right?

Id: [0x0006B989]
And the back. In. Big breath. Oh, dear.

Id: [0x0006B98A]
[coughs]

Id: [0x0006B98B]
I've never heard anything quite like it. Hmmm. Difficult case. Could you stand for me, please?

Id: [0x0006B98C]
Why, certainly.

Id: [0x0006B98D]
Just... Yes. Good. And sit back down. I see. Oh, dear. Dear, dear, dear. Tell me, do you snore?

Id: [0x0006B98E]
I don't know. I'm asleep.

Id: [0x0006B98F]
Sleeping too much, eh?

Id: [0x0006B990]
No, I don't think so...

Id: [0x0006B9D0]
I want to get her something nice.  I could get her a shawl, but none would be as nice as the one she made herself.

Id: [0x0006B9D1]
No, no. That's no gift for her. Listen. [They become conspiratorial.]Here's what you do.

Id: [0x0006B9D2]
Yes?

Id: [0x0006B9D3]
You go out and shoot a couple of squirrels.

Id: [0x0006B9D4]
Squirrels?

Id: [0x0006B9D5]
I'll give the skins to Corrine and she'll make a nice hat.

Id: [0x0006B9D6]
A hat?

Id: [0x0006B9D7]
That's right.

Id: [0x0006B9D8]
I think I need another of the same.

Id: [0x0006B9D9]
This will put hair on your toes.

Id: [0x0006B9DA]
A squirrel hat.

Id: [0x0006B9DC]
Yes. Corrine will make the hat and Prudence will know nothing about it.

Id: [0x0006B9DD]
But why would Prudence want a squirrel hat?

Id: [0x0006B9DE]
Winter, man! Any woman would lose her head over one, I assure you!

Id: [0x0006B9DF]
Good-bye, my love!

Id: [0x0006B9E6]
Sorry, but I've some work needs doing...

Id: [0x0006B9E8]
Can't talk right now, I'm afraid...

Id: [0x0006B9EB]
Mister Franklin I believe I have something you'd like.

Id: [0x0006B9ED]
You... You did it! You found the missing pages! Incredible!

Id: [0x0006B9EE]
Thank you for the kind words, but it was nothing really.

Id: [0x0006B9EF]
Nothing? It was impossible! They were gone. Scattered. And yet here they are, reunited.

Id: [0x0006B9F1]
Here. Take this. Least I can do. You are a miracle worker! I shall sing your praises forever!

Id: [0x0006B9F3]
Much as I'd love to chat, I have some reading to do at present. I hope you understand.

Id: [0x0006B9F5]
Let us speak later, my friend.

Id: [0x0006B9F6]
Yes, he is. Because he is a gentleman! That is what he is. A perfect gentleman! Let me just tell you[She leans in], if he were interested in me, I would not turn him out!

Id: [0x0006B9F7]
Ellen!

Id: [0x0006B9F8]
I cannot believe I just said that!

Id: [0x0006B9F9]
Yes, well. Honor. It is a bit of a luxury.

Id: [0x0006B9FB]
If you're having trouble finding what you're looking for, use eagle vision.

Id: [0x0006B9FD]
Don't forget about your eagle vision, Desmond.

Id: [0x0006B9FF]
Eagle vision might help here.

Id: [0x0006BA01]
You can track the guards more easily by using eagle vision.

Id: [0x0006BA03]
Excuse me, Doctor. Catherine and I, well we don't read so good. Does this say a ship will sink?

Id: [0x0006BA04]
"The ship Westerly is bound for Haiti and the Caribbean. For freight or passage apply to Isaac Greenleafe. She has extraordinary accommodations for passengers, and it is determined they shall be dispatched by the time fixed."

Id: [0x0006BA05]
That bit sounds all right.

Id: [0x0006BA07]
Careful! There's a guard up here. Don't let him see you.

Id: [0x0006BA09]
I think he's in the garden near the entrance...

Id: [0x0006BA0B]
Cross is probably looking for a way out of here. Hurry up and find him before he escapes!

Id: [0x0006BA0D]
The garden, Desmond. Head for the garden!

Id: [0x0006BA0F]
Move! Move!

Id: [0x0006BA11]
Get the fuck outta my way!

Id: [0x0006BA13]
Jesus Christ! Stop screaming!

Id: [0x0006BA15]
Shut up! Shut up!

Id: [0x0006BA17]
The stadium is crawling with Abstergo agents. Don't let them see you.

Id: [0x0006BA24]
[Seguran√ßa! Seguran√ßa!]Security! Security!

Id: [0x0006BA25]
[O que √© que √© isto?]What is it?

Id: [0x0006BA26]
[Ele est√° aqui! Ele est√° aqui! O homen dos cartazes!]He's here! He's here! That man from the posters!

Id: [0x0006BA27]
[Deixe-me ver.]Show me.

Id: [0x0006BA28]
[Eu n√£o posso...ele...ele sumiu. Mas ele n√£o poderia ter ido longe. Eu vi ele faz pouco tempo]I can't... He... He disappeared. But he couldn't have gone far. I just saw him.

Id: [0x0006BA2A]
Watch your back. They're on to you.

Id: [0x0006BA57]
"The ship will sail on the eleventh," not "fail". It's a short "s".

Id: [0x0006BA58]
Oh. That's all right then!

Id: [0x0006BA86]
It doesn't say the ship will fail on the eleventh?

Id: [0x0006BA87]
Aye, that's what had us so worried. The ship will fail.

Id: [0x0006BADF]
Hello, Ellen. I've got some pelts for you.

Id: [0x0006BAE0]
Wonderful! It is the perfect time, I just finished with the last ones.

Id: [0x0006BAE1]
Fresh from the forest.

Id: [0x0006BAE2]
You always bring the very best, Myriam, my friend. What do we have? Wolf... bear... more wolf. How about sixty-five cents?

Id: [0x0006BAE3]
We've got a deal.

Id: [0x0006BAE4]
Very good! Good-bye, Myriam!

Id: [0x0006BAE6]
Perfect! Good-bye, Ellen. Good to see you.

Id: [0x0006BAE8]
Father, will ye read us this letter?

Id: [0x0006BAE9]
It's from me family in Scotland. They've never wrote before.

Id: [0x0006BAEA]
Help us, could ye?

Id: [0x0006BAEB]
Why, certainly. Let me see. "Dearest Catherine, I write to you in some..." Excuse, me. Having a little trouble with the handwriting... Something about an unfortunate... Oh[turns away]... Oh. I see.

Id: [0x0006BAED]
I'm afraid your brother has died, Catherine.

Id: [0x0006BAEE]
He has nae!

Id: [0x0006BAEF]
That's not possible, Father!

Id: [0x0006BAF0]
It says, "Your dear brother, James, has passed on..."

Id: [0x0006BAF1]
No! Read it again!

Id: [0x0006BAF2]
"... taken away by the influenza this past night, rest his soul."

Id: [0x0006BAF3]
You've read it wrong!

Id: [0x0006BAF4]
I'm so sorry, Catherine. I truly am.

Id: [0x0006BAF5]
What is it?

Id: [0x0006BAFC]
Here y'are.

Id: [0x0006BAFD]
Careful.

Id: [0x0006BAFF]
We cannae tarry.

Id: [0x0006BB00]
No, we're in a rush.

Id: [0x0006BB01]
We must finish this, then there's much to do back at the yard. Let's get to it.

Id: [0x0006BB03]
That's thirsty work.

Id: [0x0006BB04]
Aye, 'tis.

Id: [0x0006BB05]
Let's have ourselves a wee drink.

Id: [0x0006BB07]
Here y'are.

Id: [0x0006BB08]
Thank ye.

Id: [0x0006BB09]
It's too blessed muckle much. We'll work ourselves to the bone, we will. [takes bottle]Back to work.

Id: [0x0006BB0A]
Aye. [stands]Twice the pace, now.

Id: [0x0006BB0C]
That's the last of it.

Id: [0x0006BB0E]
I came here to find peace, to get away.

Id: [0x0006BB0F]
I did, too.

Id: [0x0006BB10]
I mean I was chased away! My apprentice, whom I knew and trusted, turned me in to the Crown! [hiccup]I was to be arrested for sedition!

Id: [0x0006BB11]
How sad... What is 'sedition'?

Id: [0x0006BB12]
Worse, I have to worry that someone will find me out here.

Id: [0x0006BB13]
But we will look after you! You have us!

Id: [0x0006BB16]
[hiccup]But it's an absurdity. I'm just a craftsman. I can't influence anything!

Id: [0x0006BB18]
But in the grand view of things, of what import is one small woodworker? [hiccup]Kings and governments decide our fate. It's beyond our reach, for we are but poor [hiccup]foot-soldiers in a vast campaign.

Id: [0x0006BB19]
That's true enough.

Id: [0x0006BB1A]
But we have need of foot-soldiers.

Id: [0x0006BB1B]
Cannon fodder.

Id: [0x0006BB1C]
Yup.

Id: [0x0006BB1D]
No one man can influence history.

Id: [0x0006BB1F]
Get him on his feet.

Id: [0x0006BB21]
I forget nothing. [a beat]Which way, then?

Id: [0x0006BB22]
Right... See, thing is, I've never actually used these tunnels. So I've no idea.

Id: [0x0006BB23]
[√ìtsta...]Damn...

Id: [0x0006BB24]
What was that?

Id: [0x0006BB25]
Nothing. [a sigh]I guess we have some exploring to do...

Id: [0x0006BB26]
Lead on, then!

Id: [0x0006BB28]
I don't think this is the right way.

Id: [0x0006BB2A]
We've walked too long - this isn't right.

Id: [0x0006BB2C]
Let's turn around. This isn't leading us anywhere.

Id: [0x0006BB2E]
I can't help but feel this is the wrong direction.

Id: [0x0006BB30]
This seems wrong. We should try another way.

Id: [0x0006BB32]
We should turn back and try a different path.

Id: [0x0006BB34]
We all depend upon one another. Everyone is important.

Id: [0x0006BB35]
You can make a damn good armoire!

Id: [0x0006BB36]
Yes, yes, but --

Id: [0x0006BB38]
What is the meaning of this, Thomas?!

Id: [0x0006BB3A]
This is treason!

Id: [0x0006BB3C]
You did a fine job on that oak tree!

Id: [0x0006BB3D]
I did, didn't I?

Id: [0x0006BB3F]
Here y'are.

Id: [0x0006BB40]
[She drinks.]Godfrey! You're a hard workin' man!

Id: [0x0006BB41]
That I am.

Id: [0x0006BB42]
And I lent a hand, I did.

Id: [0x0006BB43]
You did! To you! [drinks]Another?

Id: [0x0006BB44]
Sure. [She drinks]Oh, I'm feelin' all tipsy!

Id: [0x0006BB46]
Father, we've a letter from my sister. I can't read a word, nor Kate neither.

Id: [0x0006BB47]
Of course. Let me have a look.

Id: [0x0006BB48]
I hope she's all right.

Id: [0x0006BB49]
Well, Godfrey, it appears it's good news.

Id: [0x0006BB4A]
An uncle! No! I can't believe it! Oh, happy day!

Id: [0x0006BB4B]
An uncle, Godfrey!  Oh, you'll make a grand uncle, ye will!

Id: [0x0006BB4C]
A baby girl. She's to be named Eleanor.

Id: [0x0006BB4D]
Aye, a wee baby girl! A wee lass.

Id: [0x0006BB4E]
Congratulations, Godfrey.

Id: [0x0006BB50]
What?

Id: [0x0006BB51]
You're an uncle!

Id: [0x0006BB52]
I'm an uncle! My sister's had a wee bairn (child).

Id: [0x0006BB53]
We must have a celebration!

Id: [0x0006BB55]
All right then. Let's have at it.

Id: [0x0006BB57]
Go.

Id: [0x0006BB59]
Mmmmmmaah!

Id: [0x0006BB5B]
Down![laugh]

Id: [0x0006BB5C]
Another.

Id: [0x0006BB5D]
Right.

Id: [0x0006BB5E]
Go.

Id: [0x0006BB60]
Ah. Ah. Ah. Aaaawh!

Id: [0x0006BB62]
Down.

Id: [0x0006BB63]
Well done.

Id: [0x0006BB64]
Thank ye.

Id: [0x0006BB65]
Break the tie?

Id: [0x0006BB66]
What say we call it a gentleman's draw?

Id: [0x0006BB67]
Right.

Id: [0x0006BB69]
You should really watch where you're going... Rejoin me when you've found a way out.

Id: [0x0006BB6B]
So close, yet so far... You'll need to find a way around the flames.

Id: [0x0006BB6D]
God dammit! A man can't pay his whole life for one decision! A fella has to leave it behind, start again, get a second chance. Try to do better.

Id: [0x0006BB6F]
Let's say a young man joined the army. Wore the red coat and all of that. Once he cottons to his mistake, he's got to be able to leave it behind!

Id: [0x0006BB71]
Leave it behind! [Raises his mug in a toast.]To the past!

Id: [0x0006BB73]
To the future!

Id: [0x0006BB75]
That's enough of that. [burp]Back to work. Evenin'.

Id: [0x0006BB76]
Yes.

Id: [0x0006BB77]
That's why a fella comes out here, to a new place. Start over.

Id: [0x0006BB78]
Yes.

Id: [0x0006BB79]
Hear, hear!

Id: [0x0006BB80]
It's a good idea you've had. Now let's see if it works.

Id: [0x0006BB88]
What is it?

Id: [0x0006BB89]
A request for aid from Paul Revere. Seems the Redcoats are up to something in Boston. Guess you made an impression on the Sons of Liberty.

Id: [0x0006BB8A]
They mistake me for one of their own.

Id: [0x0006BB8C]
Please tell Mister Revere he has my sympathies, but I cannot help at present.

Id: [0x0006BB8E]
You might wish to reconsider: John Pitcairn is mentioned by name.

Id: [0x0006BB90]
Where am I to go?

Id: [0x0006BB91]
Mister Revere's house in Boston. If you'd like I can...

Id: [0x0006BB93]
...take you to him?

Id: [0x0006BB98]
Your letter said John Pitcairn was here.

Id: [0x0006BB99]
Aye. He's readying an assault on Lexington, where Adams and Hancock have taken shelter. After that, he will march on Concord - hoping to destroy our weapons and supplies. You must help us!

Id: [0x0006BB9B]
Only tell me where to find him and I will put a stop to this.

Id: [0x0006BB9C]
He has dozens, if not hundreds, of soldiers at his command. You cannot hope to match him by yourself.

Id: [0x0006BB9E]
But fear not - for you will not have to!

Id: [0x0006BBA0]
We have an entire army of our own - merely awaiting the order to take up arms.

Id: [0x0006BBA1]
Then you must call upon them.

Id: [0x0006BC05]
I haven't the money to pay the man! I'm in dire straits!

Id: [0x0006BC06]
Come along with us. We set sail tomorrow.

Id: [0x0006BC07]
How much?

Id: [0x0006BC08]
Ninety cents, but there's a chance for more in Halifax. We'll find something there.

Id: [0x0006BC09]
I need the money now! He wants it now!

Id: [0x0006BC0A]
He can't get you if you're away on a ship. You pay when you return and he'll be happy.

Id: [0x0006BC0B]
You've a point there. Agreed.

Id: [0x0006BC11]
I should do the same.

Id: [0x0006BC14]
Why? What reason have you to help?

Id: [0x0006BC15]
Does it matter?

Id: [0x0006BC51]
Connor! It has occurred to me that the times we live in will be looked upon by future generations with a certain degree of scrutiny, no matter the outcome. With that in mind, I think it valuable to record the goings on around the homestead- a true log of how people lived during this time of transition. Something to help color the portrait. What do you think?

Id: [0x0006BC52]
When I find a moment, I will try.

Id: [0x0006BC53]
Very good.

Id: [0x0006BCBA]
Stop there! What's become of your escort?

Id: [0x0006BCBC]
Hold! Identify yourselves! ... Where is Lieutenant Jones? What's the meaning of this?

Id: [0x0006BCBD]
Impostors! Down, off the cart! Now!

Id: [0x0006BCC0]
What is it, boy?

Id: [0x0006BCC1]
Put down your weapons!

Id: [0x0006BCC3]
You! Stop! ... I don't know you.

Id: [0x0006BCC4]
Raise your hands! Who are you really?

Id: [0x0006BCC6]
Ah-ha! Bringing fresh meat, eh? ... Come here, I want to take a look before Silas uses her.

Id: [0x0006BCC7]
I'm no fool!

Id: [0x0006BCC9]
One moment there. Are you new? Who's your officer?

Id: [0x0006BCCA]
You'll not come through here!

Id: [0x0006BCCC]
Benjamin! Glad to have you with us! I could use some help!

Id: [0x0006BCCE]
I'll deal with this wretch!

Id: [0x0006BCD0]
Back! You vile pox!

Id: [0x0006BCD2]
I'll fillet you like a cod!

Id: [0x0006BCD4]
The Order stands united!

Id: [0x0006BCD7]
More lobsterbacks on their way!

Id: [0x0006BCD8]
Soldiers advancing on us!

Id: [0x0006BCD9]
Redcoats coming to the ship!

Id: [0x0006BCDA]
Redcoats, there!

Id: [0x0006BCDC]
If this be treason, make the most of it!

Id: [0x0006BCDD]
This is parliament's reward!

Id: [0x0006BCDE]
They wanted to unload the tea? It shall be unloaded. Into the harbor!

Id: [0x0006BCDF]
A fair day for an unfair tax!

Id: [0x0006BCE1]
Destroy the tea, men!

Id: [0x0006BCE2]
Keep going, boys!

Id: [0x0006BCE3]
You're half way there!

Id: [0x0006BCE4]
Just a few crates left!

Id: [0x0006BCEF]
Charge, men! Charge!

Id: [0x0006BCF0]
Steady, men! Hold steady!

Id: [0x0006BCF1]
Meet them with lead!

Id: [0x0006BCF2]
Advance! In formation!

Id: [0x0006BCF4]
Fix bayonets!

Id: [0x0006BCF9]
You - in the cart. I need to inspect your cargo.

Id: [0x0006BD0F]
Here's more of them!

Id: [0x0006BD11]
Redcoats!

Id: [0x0006BD13]
They're coming to stop us!

Id: [0x0006BD15]
We must hold them off!

Id: [0x0006BD17]
This tea is not welcome in Boston!

Id: [0x0006BD19]
Let's see you drink your damn tea, now!

Id: [0x0006BD1B]
When will we be afforded representation?!

Id: [0x0006BD1D]
That's the way, boys!

Id: [0x0006BD1F]
Destroy those crates!

Id: [0x0006BD21]
Almost finished!

Id: [0x0006BD23]
Those two! Get them!

Id: [0x0006BD25]
Don't let them escape!

Id: [0x0006BD27]
Get him! The Indian, too!

Id: [0x0006BD29]
Take them down!

Id: [0x0006BD2B]
That one and his half-breed!

Id: [0x0006BD2D]
Surround them!

Id: [0x0006BD30]
More of them!

Id: [0x0006BD32]
Careful, Connor! There's more!

Id: [0x0006BD34]
They have reinforcements.

Id: [0x0006BD7B]
Prudence! You must tell me!

Id: [0x0006BD7C]
What I will tell you is that I was lucky to escape with my honor intact.

Id: [0x0006BD81]
Connor, head back to the docks and see to the destruction of the tea. If you should need us, return here.

Id: [0x0006BD83]
Go on, Connor.

Id: [0x0006BD85]
You should get going.

Id: [0x0006BD8A]
I do not care.

Id: [0x0006BD8B]
Before I met Warren, I was courted by a man. A man for who I felt affection. But then I found out his intentions were not at all honorable.

Id: [0x0006BD9C]
No! What have you done?!

Id: [0x0006BD9E]
My guard's been slain!

Id: [0x0006BDA0]
Corporal Smythe has been killed!

Id: [0x0006BDA2]
He's killing my guards!

Id: [0x0006BDA4]
I need aid!

Id: [0x0006BDB9]
We will keep them safe from the fighting when they arrive.

Id: [0x0006BDBA]
I am having no doubts about this. My worry is now of the crossing itself. Many miles overland to a port in France. There they must be purchasing safe passage aboard a ship coming to the colonies. Then they must brave the voyage itself. Many risks.

Id: [0x0006BDBB]
Your son can lead them, you said yourself he is strong and capable.

Id: [0x0006BDBC]
My son!? Ha! No matter how strong he grows he will never be as strong as my wife. Wihelmina is the most able person I have ever met- else I would not have left them. It is more matters of fortune that trouble me. Storms, pirates.

Id: [0x0006BDBD]
These are things none can control, but I am sure if pirates try and take their ship, Wihelmina and your boy will make the brigands rue their decision.

Id: [0x0006BDBE]
Yes! Yes you are right!

Id: [0x0006BDCB]
...seems to be receding...Residual seismic and volcanic activity is being reported, but nothing approaching earlier levels...

Id: [0x0006BDCC]
Obviously it will be a while before experts are able to assess the full extent of the damage caused by today's event. But it appears the worst is behind us...

Id: [0x0006BDCD]
We'll be sure to bring you more as this story develops...

Id: [0x0006BDCF]
We've got a problem. Haytham doesn't have the amulet anymore.

Id: [0x0006BDD0]
But the Temple's still sending data. There must be more to the story...

Id: [0x0006BDD1]
Only one way to find out.

Id: [0x0006BE19]
I met your Da.  It was a long time ago in London, I was just a boy- well, didn't meet him really, just saw him do a fella in at the London Opera House. I was sitting in the balcony with an uncle of mine. Went to have a piss and when I came back, there's your Da. Dashing as they come, he was- shirt, jacket immaculate. My uncle was just slumped there. Looked like he was sleeping, but I knew better even if I was only a child. Your Da locked eyes on me. And I don't think I've ever been so frightened as I was in that instant. It wasn't a fear that he was going cause me pain, it was this sense that he saw right through me- into my heart- and he would crush it if it had pleased him. But he didn't. He just raised his finger to his lips and gestured for my silence. I complied. Then he was gone.

Id: [0x0006BE1D]
How do you do, Connor?

Id: [0x0006BE1E]
I am all right. And you?

Id: [0x0006BE1F]
It's nice to be a part of something. Until now I was sort of drifting about the neighborhood getting irate when I saw things I thought unjust. Sometimes I'd intervene, other times I would come here. Now I feel like all my energy is pointed at something.

Id: [0x0006BE20]
I am grateful to have your help. How did you come to be...you?

Id: [0x0006BE23]
The enemy draws close.

Id: [0x0006BE25]
Tell us when it is time to strike.

Id: [0x0006BE28]
There. In front of us.

Id: [0x0006BE29]
When do we strike?

Id: [0x0006BE2C]
Now! Now!

Id: [0x0006BE2E]
Kill them!

Id: [0x0006BE32]
Stop them!

Id: [0x0006BE35]
Alert the convoy!

Id: [0x0006BE37]
Ambush!

Id: [0x0006BE39]
We await your signal.

Id: [0x0006BE3A]
We will soon be upon them.

Id: [0x0006BE3C]
Attack!

Id: [0x0006BE3D]
It's an ambush!

Id: [0x0006BE3E]
Warn the others!

Id: [0x0006BE3F]
We've been ambushed!

Id: [0x0006BE40]
That must have been in the days before his betrayal was made public. He would have sailed for the Colonies not long after. I'm astonished that you were actually there.

Id: [0x0006BE41]
You can imagine my surprise when I saw his face. Took me a while to piece it together, but... there you have it. Thought you'd like to know.

Id: [0x0006BE42]
Thank you.

Id: [0x0006BE43]
You are an Assassin. Nothing else.

Id: [0x0006BE44]
That I am. And proud of it.

Id: [0x0006BE45]
Ha! Funny question but I get your meaning. I was an orphan, pretty common around the ports with all the sailors and whores mucking about. I wanted to be out on my own so I did what I had to do. That's when I decided to pretend to be a boy. That worked for a time, until nature decided otherwise and it just became a bad joke. Folks around the borough still called me 'Dobby' but the old codgers started leering and getting fresh. That's when I got tough. Took a good many shots to the face before I learned to defend myself properly but now I dare any man to come at me. They learn the price quick.

Id: [0x0006BE47]
You must stop him!

Id: [0x0006BE48]
Accept what is to come!

Id: [0x0006BE4A]
Submit, Edward!

Id: [0x0006BE4C]
No point in dragging this out!

Id: [0x0006BE4E]
Damn you, Haytham!

Id: [0x0006BE50]
Make way!

Id: [0x0006BE54]
Someone kill the bastard!

Id: [0x0006BE56]
You don't want to die a coward, do you?!

Id: [0x0006BE58]
You can't outrun me, Edward!

Id: [0x0006BE5B]
I don't deserve this!

Id: [0x0006BE5D]
You're a hypocrite, Haytham!

Id: [0x0006BE5F]
I'm sorry Edward, but you've forced my hand.

Id: [0x0006BE62]
Dammit!

Id: [0x0006BE63]
Hello, Dobby.

Id: [0x0006BE64]
Connor. You look well.

Id: [0x0006BE65]
I have been better.

Id: [0x0006BE66]
Do you ever sleep? I really don't know how you do it.

Id: [0x0006BE67]
I try not to think about it.

Id: [0x0006BE68]
A strong man, stronger than any I've ever met. How is it a man like you has no wife?

Id: [0x0006BE69]
I do not have the time to give a woman what she deserves. Perhaps when all this is over I will be able to settle and have a family. I hope.

Id: [0x0006BE6A]
Of all the lecherous and deceitful men out there who are fathers you'd be a godsend. But I suppose that's how it is, the good ones are too busy for it and the louts have nothing better to do. In any case, if you ever think it's time, make sure I get the first crack!

Id: [0x0006BE6B]
Hmm, I promise.

Id: [0x0006BE76]
On the left!

Id: [0x0006BE78]
They're coming in on the left!

Id: [0x0006BE79]
To the right, sir!

Id: [0x0006BE7B]
Right side! Right side!

Id: [0x0006BE7E]
Mind the center, sir!

Id: [0x0006BE80]
They're marching straight for us!

Id: [0x0006BE81]
They've formed a line on our left, sir!

Id: [0x0006BE83]
They've formed up to the right!

Id: [0x0006BE87]
Sir! Skirmishers on our left!

Id: [0x0006BE89]
Enemy skirmishers flanking right!

Id: [0x0006BE8B]
We have enemy skirmishers moving down the center!

Id: [0x0006BE8E]
We've an advancing line on the left!

Id: [0x0006BE90]
Enemy in line on right!

Id: [0x0006BE92]
Sir! The enemy line is advancing on our center!

Id: [0x0006BE94]
Left side!

Id: [0x0006BE95]
Right side!

Id: [0x0006BEDA]
What are we doing down here, anyway?

Id: [0x0006BFD0]
Arrrrrg!

Id: [0x0006BFD2]
Bloody hell. Can you help me?

Id: [0x0006BFDD]
What are you waiting for?!

Id: [0x0006BFDF]
Connor please!

Id: [0x0006BFE0]
Connor, we must hurry!

Id: [0x0006BFE2]
No time to waste, Connor!

Id: [0x0006C040]
Come along, Terry. Let us have a little dance.

Id: [0x0006C041]
Dancin'? Aye, we used to dance, didn't we, now? That was back when we were a-courtin'. The old days. [drinks]I'd dance the fling and drink a tankard without so much as a by-your-leave! All the folks a-clappin' and stompin' their feet. Oh, I could take a spin across the floor, I could, with me bonnie Diana in me arms! With a step and a step and leap-leap-leap! We'd pick our feet up to the sky, you and me! We'd float with the fiddles and jump with the pipes! Oh, Diana!

Id: [0x0006C042]
So let's dance now.

Id: [0x0006C043]
Aye, sure we're going to dance. I wouldnae miss it for all the world! [drinks]But, Diana, lass, there's no music! We cannae dance without music. It's madness itself!

Id: [0x0006C044]
I don't care about any music!

Id: [0x0006C045]
You want to dance with no music? Sure, I suppose. Who needs fiddles when we have the music of each other and the rhythm in our feet? The only thing is, Diana me lovely, the only thing is me knee. Me old knee. It's been giving me a wagon of trouble these last days, and Godfrey knocked it by mistake with a log and it's not right yet. Ah, dammit! If only me knee was good, I'd take you by the waist and toss you up and up into the air! Oh, what a sight, Diana. If only it weren't for this knee o' mine!

Id: [0x0006C046]
You! I give up!

Id: [0x0006C052]
Terry works so hard. I don't mean to complain about him, but... I don't know.

Id: [0x0006C053]
Terry's a good husband to you, no doubt about it.

Id: [0x0006C054]
But I just wish, and please tell me if I'm unreasonable, but just once, Catherine, could he be a little romantic!

Id: [0x0006C055]
Terry, romantic?

Id: [0x0006C056]
Yes. Just once in a while.

Id: [0x0006C057]
But what do you mean?

Id: [0x0006C058]
I don't know, bring me something nice, say something. Show me some affection.

Id: [0x0006C059]
That's silliness, Diana. Terry does the important things, you do nae want to nag just because he does nae think to say things.

Id: [0x0006C05A]
But it would be so much more pleasant. He's a very good man, but every day is a drudge, and he could help make that better. [She leans in]I notice Godfrey is very affectionate.

Id: [0x0006C05B]
I get him drunk.

Id: [0x0006C05C]
What?! You're joking!

Id: [0x0006C05D]
No! I get him drunk!

Id: [0x0006C05E]
Oh tell me all about it

Id: [0x0006C05F]
He's a warm man in any case, but when I feel I'd like a little more attention, I just see to it that he gets an extra tumbler of rum or two.

Id: [0x0006C060]
Would that work for me?

Id: [0x0006C061]
Next time Terry's in a good mood, pour him a double.

Id: [0x0006C062]
I'll give it a try.

Id: [0x0006C06E]
Norris, you big cuddly bear.

Id: [0x0006C06F]
And you've trapped me!

Id: [0x0006C071]
I have much to get done, mon p'tit bijou (my lil jewel).

Id: [0x0006C072]
Take care, love.

Id: [0x0006C074]
Docteur? (Doctor?) Could you read this for Myriam?

Id: [0x0006C075]
I've never gotten a letter before.

Id: [0x0006C076]
What could it be?

Id: [0x0006C077]
Let's have a look, shall we? ... So, it appears you sold three dozen pelts to a shipping company on consignment.

Id: [0x0006C07A]
The ship never made it to Charleston. It sank.

Id: [0x0006C07B]
Sank!

Id: [0x0006C07C]
But such ships like that don't sank!

Id: [0x0006C07D]
This says to inform all consignees that all merchandise has been lost.

Id: [0x0006C07E]
But, they'll still pay. No?

Id: [0x0006C07F]
"No revenue will therefore be available for disbursement."

Id: [0x0006C080]
I've lost a winter's worth of work!

Id: [0x0006C083]
Doctor White. Diana's been posted this letter.

Id: [0x0006C084]
It looks as if it's from my mum.

Id: [0x0006C085]
She knows we cannae read. Must be important.

Id: [0x0006C086]
Let's find out. "Dear Diana, It's difficult to write under trying circumstances. You know how your father has always..." Mm[turns away]... Oh, my. That's a shame.

Id: [0x0006C087]
What's a shame?

Id: [0x0006C089]
Your father's left your mother, Diana.

Id: [0x0006C08A]
He's left?

Id: [0x0006C08B]
What d'ye mean, "left"?

Id: [0x0006C08C]
"Your father, enamored of the bottle has left me."

Id: [0x0006C08D]
"Enamored of the bottle?"

Id: [0x0006C08E]
"He always loved his whiskey. Now he's chosen it over me."

Id: [0x0006C08F]
Bastard!

Id: [0x0006C09F]
How's the view from down there!?

Id: [0x0006C0A1]
Enjoying yourself? Wonder how long 'fore you pass out!

Id: [0x0006C0A3]
Don't think she wants to marry you, mate!

Id: [0x0006C0A5]
Our ale is worth a taste, I promise you!

Id: [0x0006C0A7]
Have a fresh pot of stew on the fire if you'd fancy a bowl.

Id: [0x0006C0AA]
Watch yourself!

Id: [0x0006C0AB]
Oi!

Id: [0x0006C0AC]
A timely gift from Norris, it would seem.

Id: [0x0006C0AD]
Indeed. I must make sure to thank him properly.

Id: [0x0006C0AE]
Norris. [beat]Are you in there?

Id: [0x0006C0AF]
Uh, oui! (yes!)

Id: [0x0006C0B0]
Oh, I will find you a little later, then.

Id: [0x0006C0B1]
Non! Non! (No! No!) It's all right. What is it?

Id: [0x0006C0B4]
Hold still a minute. I gotta decide where to start.

Id: [0x0006C0B6]
Just a quick little swipe and no more ears! How's that sound, Mister Church?

Id: [0x0006C0B7]
At least I'll be spared more of your inane prattle.

Id: [0x0006C0B9]
Maybe you'll get lucky and pass out, though I dare say I'll do me best to ensure that doesn't happen.

Id: [0x0006C0BB]
You're a ruffian common as dirt, Cutter.

Id: [0x0006C0BC]
And proud of it!

Id: [0x0006C0BE]
Your parents must be so very proud to have raised a specimen like yourself.

Id: [0x0006C0BF]
Quiet now! I need to concentrate on me work.

Id: [0x0006C0CF]
Doctor! You need to help me!

Id: [0x0006C0D1]
I'm in a bad way, here!

Id: [0x0006C0D2]
A little bit from here... a little bit from there... Make meself a nice keepsake, I will.

Id: [0x0006C0D3]
You're absolutely mad.

Id: [0x0006C0D4]
Just like all good artists!

Id: [0x0006C0D9]
Heard Washington sent you to help. I got some things that need doing, Lord knows this fort is a right mess. If you got the time, see to this list and it'll go a long way towards getting this place ship-shape again.

Id: [0x0006C0DC]
Where'd Travis get off to?

Id: [0x0006C0DD]
Heard his son has got the sickness, Arnold sent him home.

Id: [0x0006C0DE]
Not what I heard. I heard he's proper disappeared.

Id: [0x0006C0DF]
Wherever he went, his replacement is something of a bore. Quiet fellow. Keeps to himself. Not like Travis was, always up for a laugh.

Id: [0x0006C0E0]
I know what you mean. Feels like the new chap is gonna strangle me in my sleep.

Id: [0x0006C0E1]
Hahahah. Come off it.

Id: [0x0006C0E2]
Sir! I need a word. It's important.

Id: [0x0006C0E3]
Get back to your station, soldier.

Id: [0x0006C0E5]
I really think you should hear this, sir.

Id: [0x0006C0E6]
Is it appropriate conversation for where we stand.

Id: [0x0006C0E7]
We should probably go somewhere more private, sir.

Id: [0x0006C0E8]
Very well...

Id: [0x0006C0E9]
Doesn't like you too much, mate.

Id: [0x0006C0EA]
Better steer clear of that mutt, not fond of you it seems.

Id: [0x0006C0EB]
Quiet that dog down!

Id: [0x0006C0EC]
Here boy!

Id: [0x0006C0EE]
What's your dog after now? Spooks easily doesn't he.

Id: [0x0006C0EF]
To me!

Id: [0x0006C0F1]
[Whistles]

Id: [0x0006C0F3]
You need to help, Connor.

Id: [0x0006C0F4]
Connor! I'm so glad you're here. The plans I bought. They weren't JUST a folding chair, oh no. They had something else with them, something quite astonishing. [looks around]A flying machine designed by Leonardo Da Vinci himself! And I've built it! Ha! You can be the first to try it if you like! You'll be able to fly! Soar like an eagle!

Id: [0x0006C0F5]
And it works?

Id: [0x0006C0F6]
Da Vinci was one of the greatest minds in human history! As brilliant a man as there has ever been. You can be CERTAIN it works! Would you like to try?

Id: [0x0006C0F7]
Yes. Such a device would certainly prove useful.

Id: [0x0006C0FD]
Here's to a hard day's work!

Id: [0x0006C0FE]
Aye!

Id: [0x0006C100]
Diana?

Id: [0x0006C101]
All right. [She drinks]That's enough! You're a marvel for the work you do!

Id: [0x0006C102]
I am a marvel!

Id: [0x0006C103]
Here's to you, you marvelous bastard!

Id: [0x0006C104]
I'll drink to me! [drinks]Diana?

Id: [0x0006C105]
Not too much, now. [She drinks]That's plenty. Ah, Terry! You're a good man, y'are.

Id: [0x0006C108]
Corrine, could you please just raise up your arms? And hold them out? Thanks.

Id: [0x0006C109]
There y'are.

Id: [0x0006C10A]
Very good... your arm... and here... And now, if you do not mind, I need to measure around the ankle. I want to make sure the hose are good and tight.

Id: [0x0006C10B]
Very well, but aren't we near done?

Id: [0x0006C10C]
I just need the skirt length... and around here...

Id: [0x0006C10D]
'Twill be nice to have a new dress!

Id: [0x0006C10E]
Oh, you are going to be happy. That fine cotton! You will be the envy of us all!

Id: [0x0006C10F]
And when can I have it?

Id: [0x0006C110]
First of the month.

Id: [0x0006C111]
Lovely.

Id: [0x0006C112]
All right. I will get started on that right away.

Id: [0x0006C113]
Thanks, Ellen.

Id: [0x0006C114]
My pleasure.

Id: [0x0006C116]
We got this letter from Corrine's sister in Natick.

Id: [0x0006C117]
Could you help us Father Timothy? We can't quite make it out.

Id: [0x0006C118]
We fear it's bad news.

Id: [0x0006C119]
I'll do my best. Let's see, here. Mm... Uh-huh... Mm... Oh... Ah[turns away]... [coughs]Oh, my.

Id: [0x0006C11A]
What can it be?

Id: [0x0006C11C]
Your sister's house has burned.

Id: [0x0006C11D]
No!

Id: [0x0006C11E]
Is her family all right?

Id: [0x0006C11F]
"The family survived, but all possessions have been lost."

Id: [0x0006C120]
Oh, the poor dears!

Id: [0x0006C121]
"The house and the barn and our wagon were taken in the fire."

Id: [0x0006C122]
We must help them!

Id: [0x0006C123]
We'll take up a collection, Corrine.

Id: [0x0006C125]
I've got this letter. I'm worried it's about my mother.

Id: [0x0006C126]
Let me read it, Oliver.

Id: [0x0006C127]
She's been very ill. We fear the worst.

Id: [0x0006C128]
Let me see. It is from your father...

Id: [0x0006C129]
Has mother died?

Id: [0x0006C12A]
No. No, full recovery!

Id: [0x0006C12B]
Recovery?! Are you sure? It can't be!

Id: [0x0006C12C]
She's all right, Oliver! Your mum's all right!

Id: [0x0006C12D]
Ha-ha! It's good news! She's gotten better!

Id: [0x0006C12E]
Yes, she's up and about and feeling quite good.

Id: [0x0006C12F]
I don't believe it. I was sure she was lost.

Id: [0x0006C130]
Your mother's well! Your mother's well!

Id: [0x0006C133]
We've gotten this letter from my cousin, Jock. I cannae 'cipher it.

Id: [0x0006C134]
I'll read it for you... Hm.

Id: [0x0006C135]
Is he all right?

Id: [0x0006C136]
Ha-ha! I should say so. It appears he's coming here.

Id: [0x0006C137]
Coming here?

Id: [0x0006C138]
For a visit!

Id: [0x0006C139]
Coming for a visit! Me cousin Jock!

Id: [0x0006C13A]
Oh that's grand, that is! Your favorite cousin!

Id: [0x0006C13B]
Ha-ha! What a time we'll have!

Id: [0x0006C13C]
He hopes to arrive in a week or two.

Id: [0x0006C13D]
It'll be grand to see them again!

Id: [0x0006C13E]
We'll have to start cleaning the house!

Id: [0x0006C141]
Wait for my signal!

Id: [0x0006C143]
Hold fire!

Id: [0x0006C145]
Wait for the signal!

Id: [0x0006C147]
Make ready!

Id: [0x0006C149]
Prepare yourselves!

Id: [0x0006C14C]
Beg pardon, Doctor. I'm havin' a wee bit o' trouble reading this note from Boston.

Id: [0x0006C14D]
I'll see if I can help.

Id: [0x0006C14E]
Of course I can read. It's just... uh...

Id: [0x0006C14F]
It's from some builders in Medford.

Id: [0x0006C150]
Builders?

Id: [0x0006C151]
They're ordering two hundred cubic yards of lumber.

Id: [0x0006C152]
Two hundred! ... Oh, my!

Id: [0x0006C153]
Two hundred cubic yards Terry!

Id: [0x0006C154]
We'll be rich, Diana! We can get a new horse!

Id: [0x0006C155]
Yes, they want it delivered next month. Cash on delivery!

Id: [0x0006C156]
Wait 'til Godfrey sees this!  Ha-ha!

Id: [0x0006C157]
Oh, Catherine will near faint!

Id: [0x0006C15A]
Here's that letter I told you about. I can't make any sense of it.

Id: [0x0006C15B]
Let's see what we have here. Hm. Uh-huh. I see...

Id: [0x0006C15C]
Is it something bad?

Id: [0x0006C15D]
It's from the assay office. You sent him some ore.

Id: [0x0006C15E]
Yes. Yes, I did.

Id: [0x0006C15F]
He says it's high-grade natural iron ore.

Id: [0x0006C160]
Natural ore!? That's the best kind!

Id: [0x0006C161]
Norris! Your mine has iron!

Id: [0x0006C162]
Pure natural ore! We've struck iron!

Id: [0x0006C163]
He says it's the best quality he's seen.

Id: [0x0006C164]
Ah! I can't believe it! After all these years!

Id: [0x0006C165]
I knew you'd find something, Norris.

Id: [0x0006C169]
Doctor White, we've been reading about a man going up in the air and we cannae make head nor tail of it.

Id: [0x0006C16A]
Hm. It says someone's invented a huge balloon that can lift a man into the sky. The balloon is filled with hot air, and it's large enough to carry a man in a basket.

Id: [0x0006C16B]
Aye, but that's just what we're worried about.

Id: [0x0006C16C]
What becomes of the man?

Id: [0x0006C16D]
How does he get back down? To his family?

Id: [0x0006C16E]
It says that the operator can let air out to descend. This man landed in a wheat field with small injuries.

Id: [0x0006C16F]
Ah! No one is lost, then. Good.

Id: [0x0006C172]
Go ahead.

Id: [0x0006C173]
Hmmph!

Id: [0x0006C174]
Mph!

Id: [0x0006C175]
Mh!

Id: [0x0006C176]
Whup.

Id: [0x0006C177]
Hm.

Id: [0x0006C178]
Uh-huh.

Id: [0x0006C179]
Aye.

Id: [0x0006C17A]
Oh... I- I see. My apologies.

Id: [0x0006C17B]
Take care with your tongue in the future.

Id: [0x0006C17C]
Certainly, sir. Upon my honor.

Id: [0x0006C17E]
There! You're free now. Best you hide.

Id: [0x0006C180]
Go! Hide.

Id: [0x0006C182]
Stay in the shadows, friend.

Id: [0x0006C184]
Keep hidden!

Id: [0x0006C187]
Stop slouching, soldier.

Id: [0x0006C188]
Beg pardon?

Id: [0x0006C189]
I said, stop slouching.

Id: [0x0006C18A]
Who are you to tell me what to do?

Id: [0x0006C18B]
A good friend of Mister Thatcher's.

Id: [0x0006C18D]
Who are you with?

Id: [0x0006C18E]
I don't follow.

Id: [0x0006C18F]
Lieutenant Wilkins?

Id: [0x0006C190]
Uh, no. No, no. Man named... um... Cosgrove. Lieutenant Cosgrove.

Id: [0x0006C191]
I've not heard of him.

Id: [0x0006C192]
Cosgrove? Is he the chap with the gammy leg?

Id: [0x0006C193]
That's the one. That's the very man.

Id: [0x0006C194]
Saw action at Culloden, if memory serves. Put down the clans, he did.

Id: [0x0006C195]
That's the fellow. Lieutenant Cosgrove. Hero of Culloden.

Id: [0x0006C196]
Bit of an arse, as I recall.

Id: [0x0006C197]
I've never heard of him.

Id: [0x0006C199]
Who have we got, then?

Id: [0x0006C19A]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x0006C19B]
The prisoners. Who are they?

Prisoners? There are no prisoners.

Id: [0x0006C19D]
You know who I mean. The fellows we caught.

Id: [0x0006C19E]
They do not exist. Understood? And if they did exist, we would not acknowledge them. There are no prisoners.

Id: [0x0006C19F]
Ah. Yes. Of course. My mistake.

Id: [0x0006C1A2]
I never properly said goodbye to you. I was not ready. So here I am. The weight of my responsibilities never seems to diminish. There is always something else that needs fighting for. This is something you never warned me of, maybe because you thought I would have been deterred- you would have been wrong but I know you were not accustomed to that. [snorts a soft laugh]Life carries on here. The people seem happy- they are certainly safe, at least for now. One of my brotherhood asked me something I have been struggling with, what happens if- when- we win? When we stop the Templars? It is a question I certainly do not know the answer to, perhaps you did not either. [beat]I miss you. As I miss my mother. I hope all is well with you, wherever you are. [beat]Goodbye, Old Man, until it comes time for me to join you- then I will bother you once again.

Id: [0x0006C1A4]
Don't let them see you!

Id: [0x0006C1A5]
Keeping out of sight.

Id: [0x0006C1A7]
Someone's coming.

Id: [0x0006C1A9]
This is a farce. No reason to send us down here.

Id: [0x0006C1AA]
Boss says there's a door to the inn. We need to find it.

Id: [0x0006C1AC]
Who's there?

Id: [0x0006C1B0]
La la la la la!

Id: [0x0006C1B1]
Keep quiet. Don't know who else is down here.

Id: [0x0006C1B3]
I told you! Get him!

Id: [0x0006C1B5]
I'm hungry.

Id: [0x0006C1B6]
What you telling me for? Catch a rat and eat it raw for all I care.

Id: [0x0006C1B8]
On your toes, we got company.

Id: [0x0006C1BB]
Where the bloody hell are we?

Id: [0x0006C1BC]
Haven't the faintest idea. We're proper lost.

Id: [0x0006C1BE]
We ain't alone though.

Id: [0x0006C1C1]
He'll be happy when we tell him we found this.

Id: [0x0006C1C2]
That he will. Just need to find our way out.

Id: [0x0006C1C4]
Sounds like trouble.

Id: [0x0006C1C7]
Smells down here.

Id: [0x0006C1C8]
You're what smells, I reckon.

Id: [0x0006C1C9]
Piss off.

Id: [0x0006C1CB]
Time to knuckle up.

Id: [0x0006C1D3]
How long we need to stay down here?

Id: [0x0006C1D4]
As long as it takes.

Id: [0x0006C1D5]
Could have left us with some water, at least.

Id: [0x0006C1D7]
Beat him down!

Id: [0x0006C1DB]
Move it.

Id: [0x0006C1DC]
I don't like it down here.

Id: [0x0006C1DD]
Such a dandy!

Id: [0x0006C1DF]
Time to prove yourself.

Id: [0x0006C1F8]
Now!

Id: [0x0006C1FF]
Excuse me! A minute Mr. Kenway?

Id: [0x0006C201]
Mr. Kenway! Spare a moment?

Id: [0x0006C204]
Do I know you?

Id: [0x0006C205]
No. Not yet. I'm an acquaintance of Mr. Lee. He told me not to bother you but as it stands, I've no one else to turn to. The man I entrusted high importance accounts to disappeared with 'is last charge! Now I have these letters, see, and they need delivering.  It's vital they reach their destinations. Would you consider helping me? I would be forever in your debt.

Id: [0x0006C206]
If I have time, yes. But I will hold you to your debt.

Id: [0x0006C216]
Kanen't√≥:kon?

Id: [0x0006C218]
[Oh na'√°:wen'ne?]What happened?

Id: [0x0006C220]
[√ìtkon.]Damn.

Id: [0x0006C297]
They're to pay me a portion of what they fetch in Charleston.

Id: [0x0006C298]
I see[turns away]... Oh, dear.

Id: [0x0006C299]
Have they sold in Charleston?

Id: [0x0006C29A]
Non! (No!)

Id: [0x0006C29B]
Ach!

Id: [0x0006C29C]
I'm sorry.

Id: [0x0006C2A2]
That tickles!

Id: [0x0006C2A3]
I am sorry... All right, let us see. Oh, I forgot, could you put your arms our again, please?

Id: [0x0006C2A4]
This place reeks of death.

Id: [0x0006C2A5]
Definitely not somewhere I'd want to wind up.

Id: [0x0006C2A6]
I hear tell more men have died aboard these prison hulks than in the war itself.

Id: [0x0006C2A7]
Not surprised. If the conditions don't kill ya - the guards likely will.

Id: [0x0006C2BF]
It would take months to get them into fighting shape. We don't have the time.

Id: [0x0006C2C0]
Quiet, whelp!

Id: [0x0006C2C1]
I am sorry to have disappointed.

Id: [0x0006C2C2]
As you should be. For us to have come all this way for nothing... Tell me now why I shouldn't have you thrown into the sea.

Id: [0x0006C2C3]
Present yourself to the Green Dragon Tavern in Boston with the men you've chosen. We shall meet you there along with our master.

Id: [0x0006C2DA]
Which way?

Id: [0x0006C2DC]
Where to now?

Id: [0x0006C2DE]
Which path, my friend?

Id: [0x0006C2E0]
Does any of this look familiar to you?

Id: [0x0006C2E2]
Some direction would be nice...

Id: [0x0006C2E4]
I could use your help.

Id: [0x0006C2E6]
I have not been this way before. I need direction.

Id: [0x0006C2E8]
I beg your pardon - have you seen this fellow?

Id: [0x0006C2EA]
Excuse me, do you recognize this likeness?

Id: [0x0006C2EC]
I'm looking for Mr. Church. Mister Benjamin Church.

Id: [0x0006C2EE]
Pardon. Do you know this man?

Id: [0x0006C2F0]
I'm terribly sorry, but it's important I find this man.

Id: [0x0006C2F2]
Sorry to disturb you. I'm looking for a Mister Church.

Id: [0x0006C2F4]
A moment, please. I'm looking for the man that fits this likeness.

Id: [0x0006C2F6]
It's of the utmost importance that I find this man.

Id: [0x0006C2F8]
If I may? I wonder if you recognize the man in this portrait.

Id: [0x0006C2FB]
Get back to the others! I will take care of this!

Id: [0x0006C2FD]
Go! I can deal with this.

Id: [0x0006C2FF]
Do not worry about the Redcoats! Go join the others!

Id: [0x0006C327]
They're outnumbered! We must help them!

Id: [0x0006C329]
We must aid them!

Id: [0x0006C32B]
Those men are our brothers! We cannot abandon them!

Id: [0x0006C32D]
We have to do something! The Redcoats are closing in!

Id: [0x0006C32F]
Distract the Redcoats before they open fire!

Id: [0x0006C331]
They need help over there!

Id: [0x0006C333]
If we don't act now - they're going to die!

Id: [0x0006C335]
We must do something and quickly!

Id: [0x0006C337]
Don't let the lobsterbacks shoot!

Id: [0x0006C339]
This way! Hurry!

Id: [0x0006C33B]
We've done all we can. We must retreat!

Id: [0x0006C33D]
Fall back! Fall back!

Id: [0x0006C33F]
We can do no more here! Let us return to camp!

Id: [0x0006C341]
If we remain here, we're dead men!

Id: [0x0006C343]
We need to go! Now!

Id: [0x0006C345]
Come on men, we must fall back!

Id: [0x0006C347]
Retreat brothers!

Id: [0x0006C349]
If we tarry - we'll die. Best we go!

Id: [0x0006C34E]
Look! The Redcoats have taken captives!

Id: [0x0006C350]
They've taken my brother and poor old Robert! We need to do something!

Id: [0x0006C352]
We have to help! They're over that way!

Id: [0x0006C354]
They're over there!

Id: [0x0006C356]
Come on! We'll meet up with the others in Concord!

Id: [0x0006C358]
Get moving, men! We've little time!

Id: [0x0006C35A]
We'll stop the bastards from getting to Barrett's farm.

Id: [0x0006C35C]
I've got a surprise for those lobsterbacks!

Id: [0x0006C35E]
To Concord, lads!

Id: [0x0006C360]
Stick together, boys. And keep the pace!

Id: [0x0006C363]
Help! What's happening!

Id: [0x0006C365]
They're taking prisoners! Run!

Id: [0x0006C367]
Get out! Everyone, run!

Id: [0x0006C369]
No! Head for the hills!

Id: [0x0006C36B]
I'm not waitin' round to see what happens!

Id: [0x0006C36D]
Dammit! Best get out of here!

Id: [0x0006C36F]
Connor! You're in our line of fire!

Id: [0x0006C371]
That's our field of fire, Connor! Move!

Id: [0x0006C373]
Move, Connor - or you'll be shot!

Id: [0x0006C376]
The left barricade is about to fall!

Id: [0x0006C378]
Our left is collapsing!

Id: [0x0006C37A]
They're about to breach the center barricade!

Id: [0x0006C37C]
The center barricade is about to be taken!

Id: [0x0006C37E]
Our right is weakened!

Id: [0x0006C380]
We need support on the right barricade!

Id: [0x0006C383]
Form lines! Two deep!

Id: [0x0006C385]
Line forward!

Id: [0x0006C387]
Steady, men. Advance!

Id: [0x0006C389]
Make every bullet count!

Id: [0x0006C38C]
Let's send them back across the sea!

Id: [0x0006C38E]
Get back to the cannon, Connor!

Id: [0x0006C390]
Connor! Man the cannon!

Id: [0x0006C392]
We can hold this spot. Man the cannon!

Id: [0x0006C394]
We'll be all right. Get to the cannon!

Id: [0x0006C396]
We've got it now. You're needed at the cannon.

Id: [0x0006C398]
Get back to the cannon!

Id: [0x0006C39B]
Help! Connor, we need help!

Id: [0x0006C39D]
Let go of the cannon! We need help!

Id: [0x0006C39F]
Connor! We need reinforcements!

Id: [0x0006C3A1]
Connor! Help us!

Id: [0x0006C3A3]
Help! Over here, Connor!

Id: [0x0006C3A5]
Connor, come here! We need you!

Id: [0x0006C3A8]
That'll teach those lobsterbacks!

Id: [0x0006C3AA]
Ha! Well done, lad!

Id: [0x0006C3AC]
Yes! Chase 'em back to England!

Id: [0x0006C3DD]
Bless you.

Id: [0x0006C3DE]
That's me plan!

Id: [0x0006C3E0]
Does he just float away?

Id: [0x0006C3E1]
That means it will sink, I should say.

Id: [0x0006C3E4]

Connor, this is Benjamin Tallmadge. His father was one of us, no need for secrecy. I think he has something he wants to say.

Id: [0x0006C42C]
Achilles tells me you've uncovered a plot to murder the Commander in Chief.

Id: [0x0006C42D]
Yes. But I have only false starts and dead ends to show for it.

Id: [0x0006C42E]
Not anymore, my friend. [a beat]Thomas Hickey's your man - and I aim to help you catch him.

Id: [0x0006C42F]
How?

Id: [0x0006C430]
I'll explain on the way. You and I are going to New York.

Id: [0x0006C5EB]
I've an idea: why don't you lead the way? That should keep us out of any further trouble, am I right?

Id: [0x0006C8A8]
Alright, I should be getting back to work.

Id: [0x0006C8AA]
Sorry, Desmond - little busy right now. Let's talk later.

Id: [0x0006C8AC]
Back to work I go! You should consider doing the same.

Id: [0x0006C8AE]
I'm working right now. All the visual clues are here.  Which means no time for chit-chat. Okay, Sorry.

Id: [0x0006C8B1]
Oh! I think I've found a lead on another power source...

Id: [0x0006C8B3]
Later Desmond. I'm in the middle of something very important right now!  Just...th th that's a rule, follow that as a rule.

Id: [0x0006C8B5]
We should probably get back to Connor.

Id: [0x0006C8B7]
Come on, son. We got work to do.

Id: [0x0006C8B9]
I gotta get back to work! You might wanna do the same.

Id: [0x0006C8BB]
Sorry Desmond, little busy right now...

Id: [0x0006C8BE]
Oh. Look at the time! Well doesn't time fly! Look, I think it's best we get you back in the Animus, hmm?

Id: [0x0006C8C0]
Come on! Chop chop.  We need to find that key, Desmond - it's not going to happen with you out here.  Is it?

Id: [0x0006C8C2]
The sooner we're done here, the sooner we can take that vacation!

Id: [0x0006C8C4]
Yeah, we should probably get back to work.

Id: [0x0006C8C6]
Best we finish up with Connor...

Id: [0x0006C8C8]
Come on, Desmond. In you go.

Id: [0x0006C8CA]
We're almost there, son.

Id: [0x0006C8CC]
We'll have plenty of time to talk when this is all over. We should focus on our work now.

Id: [0x0006C8D1]
When I know somethin', you'll know something.

Id: [0x0006C8D3]
Got no office to give, at current. When I do, you'll be the first to 'ear it.

Id: [0x0006C8D5]
Should not be much longer...

Id: [0x0006C8D7]
I'll let you know, soon as I have something...

Id: [0x0006C8D9]
I hope you're right Haytham...

Id: [0x0006C8DB]
I should return to my studies...

Id: [0x0006C8DC]
I've some ledgers to review. Do you mind if we speak later?

Id: [0x0006C8DE]
Sorry, Haytham but I'm in the midst of something...

Id: [0x0006C8F0]
I need you to tail his accomplice.

Id: [0x0006C8F1]
Do as I say and go!

Id: [0x0006C8F3]

Allo, Connor. That tea is being illegally smuggled all around Boston by Johnson's men. If you see any crates in transit, perhaps you could put a stop to the delivery. And those maudits (damned) tax collectors are still at it. They could use a lesson or two eh?

Id: [0x0006CD3F]
Connor! Ah, you've been busy! The collectors and smugglers are both reeling. It's just what we need. When you're done maybe we go straight to the source, eh?

Id: [0x0006CD78]
Yes.

Id: [0x0006CE72]
Commander?

Id: [0x0006CE73]
I have failed them, Connor. Only look around to know my words are true.

Id: [0x0006CE75]
This revolution once seemed a righteous thing. Our cause pure and just. We asked only for what all people deserve: liberty, equality, and respect. The Empire should have embraced us. Instead they pushed for war - a war, it seems, they are now destined to win.

Id: [0x0006CE77]
I dared to dream of better things. [a beat]Behold what it has wrought.

Id: [0x0006CE79]
Such dark thoughts will cripple a man. But only if he lets them.

Id: [0x0006CE7B]
Look again. Out there stand men and women determined to be free. Such a struggle is rarely easy, and never without sacrifice. I have often asked myself a thousand times if I would not be happier back amongst my people, living a quieter, simpler life. But if I abandoned my cause - if you abandoned yours, Commander - who would take our places? And what would become of the people who rely upon us?

Id: [0x0006CE7F]
It isn't right that they should suffer when I do not. If the ground must be their mattress, so too will it be mine.

Id: [0x0006CE80]
And what about the storm?

Id: [0x0006CE81]
If I can't take a stand against some snow, then there really is no hope for us.

Id: [0x0006D033]
The loss of such a figure would be devastating to the cause.

Id: [0x0006D2B7]
Hello again! What brings you to Boston?

Id: [0x0006D312]
Hmmm... most curious.

Id: [0x0006D40B]
I can feel it.

Id: [0x0006D561]
Fall Back! Fall Back!

Id: [0x0006D657]
Name's Haytham Kenway. You don't know me. But I believe the two of you are well acquainted...

Id: [0x0006D663]
Bollocks.

Id: [0x0006D6F6]
Pitcairn intends to kill you.

Id: [0x0006D70D]
You in the market for a husband?

Id: [0x0006D7DD]
Ow! Geez...

Id: [0x0006D7DE]
Mmm...augh...

Id: [0x0006D85F]
Shall we be off, then?

Id: [0x0006D8AD]
William, I need you to take the overland route and do the same.

Id: [0x0006D8AE]
Robert, I need you up in Christ Church. Light the signal. Two lanterns - our enemy comes by sea!

Id: [0x0006D8B1]
The world's moved on, boy. Best you do too.

Id: [0x0006D8BA]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Ratonhnhak√©:ton, wake up.

Id: [0x0006D8D1]
Now, I need to find Sam Adams.

Id: [0x0006D9EB]
A poor lie.

Id: [0x0006DA1D]
Connor! Thank god I‚Äôve found you!

Id: [0x0006DA1E]
Commander Washington?

Id: [0x0006DA1F]
I'm attacked by a new enemy! I fear I will succumb.

Id: [0x0006DA20]
What has come over you?

Id: [0x0006DA21]
Goddamn it, man! I need your help!

Id: [0x0006DA24]
Perhaps you should sit and tell me the problem.¬†

Id: [0x0006DA25]
[breathinh]My god.¬†I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happened. I‚Äôve become ‚Ä¶ [He looks at Connor]It‚Äôs the dreams. They‚Äôre driving me mad.¬†

Id: [0x0006DA26]
I never thought you were a man that would be disturbed by dreams.¬†

Id: [0x0006DA27]
You don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt understand. ‚Ä¶  They beguile me with fantastical visions. In my dream, I‚Äôm at Mount Vernon during the war. In fact, in the dream, there is no war; I stay with Martha, tending to my fields. Peaceful and content.

Id: [0x0006DA28]
It sounds like paradise.

Id: [0x0006DA29]
No they don‚Äôt stop there, the peace of the vision pushes me to‚Äî The dreams become unspeakable. [He looks at Connor]You are in them, Connor. [a pause]I believe the visions come from this.¬†

Id: [0x0006DA2C]
Where did you get it?

Id: [0x0006DA2D]
It was taken from a captured officer at Yorktown. [A beat]There was something compelling about it, so I kept it on my person. [a beat]It‚Äôs strange, for I cannot remember that officer‚Äôs face.

Id: [0x0006DA2E]
May I see it?¬†

Id: [0x0006DA31]
You're not thinking clearly.¬†

Id: [0x0006DA32]
You're right. It is the dreams, the dreams that come from this Apple.¬†

Id: [0x0006DA3B]
This Apple appears to have warned us.

Id: [0x0006DA3D]
Take it! Take it from me. I do not want it!

Id: [0x0006DA49]
On the cold, cold ground.

Id: [0x0006DA4A]
YAHHHH!

Id: [0x0006DA80]
Give that here.

Id: [0x0006DA82]
For good measure.

Id: [0x0006DA85]
Man, this stochastic model needs tuning. A distribution with a secondary peak like that'll screw us over royal. All right. I'll just wing it with some different parameters ...

Id: [0x0006DA87]
He is awake.

Id: [0x0006DA88]
Where are we?

Id: [0x0006DA89]
A safe place. By the grace of your brothers.

Id: [0x0006DA8B]
The village!

Id: [0x0006DA8C]
King George burned it. He was after your mother- your stubborn mother.

Id: [0x0006DA8D]
Where is she?

Id: [0x0006DA8E]
She did not listen and now she is dead.

Id: [0x0006DA90]
You take the news well.

Id: [0x0006DA93]
It is something that I knew - that I know. [confused]But Commander Washington, the Revolution. How did this come to be?

Id: [0x0006DA95]
How did we survive?

Id: [0x0006DA96]
By the strength granted us [a beat]by the Great Willow. [a beat]A strength you now must find.

Id: [0x0006DA97]
What power?

Id: [0x0006DAFC]
You cannot match my power. I am freedom itself!

Id: [0x0006DAFE]
You are fighting the force of liberty!

Id: [0x0006DB00]
With my power, I will rule over a free world!

Id: [0x0006DB01]
What happened to you?!

Id: [0x0006DB03]
Very well.

Id: [0x0006DB1C]
You're thieves and scoundrels one and all!

Id: [0x0006DBE5]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Rise. We must go.

Id: [0x0006DBE6]
Mother! What are you doing here?

Id: [0x0006DBE7]
Are you still dreaming? We came here together. Now we must go.

Id: [0x0006DBE9]
I thought... I thought I lost you. But you're here.

Id: [0x0006DBEB]
I am here. I have always been here.[a beat] Are you alright?

Id: [0x0006DBED]
Good. Now come, I have heard screaming in Kanien‚Äôk√©ha close by. We must learn what's going on.

Id: [0x0006DBEF]
There!

Id: [0x0006DC0B]
Mind your business.

Id: [0x0006DC0D]
Back-off, savages. This is not your concern.

Id: [0x0006DC0F]
You wanna get involved yourself? I dare ya.

Id: [0x0006DC13]
Why has Washington sent his men to raid the Frontier?

Id: [0x0006DC14]
Washington?

Id: [0x0006DC15]
To find somebody - a native woman who tried to take it from him.

Id: [0x0006DC16]
He will not find me by you.

Id: [0x0006DC18]
What could Washington have to do with this? He is no longer Commander-in-Chief, he retired to Mount Vernon.

Id: [0x0006DC19]
A lovely fantasy, Ratonhnhak√©:ton, you know Washington went mad with power long ago. I tried to stop him but failed. And now I've brought down his wrath upon my own people.

Id: [0x0006DC1A]
I don't understand. None of it fits. Are we--

Id: [0x0006DC1C]
King Washington's men are raiding Concord right now, murdering everyone. They're looking for you Kanieht√≠:io!

Id: [0x0006DC1D]
KING Washington?

Id: [0x0006DC1E]
Come.

Id: [0x0006DC20]
Only tell us where she is and these people live. Refuse and they burn. It's really quite simple.

Id: [0x0006DC21]
We don't know who you want!

Id: [0x0006DC24]
Very well.

Id: [0x0006DC39]
No one knows how King Washington came to possess the scepter; [a beat]but now that he has it, no one can stop him. We were surviving, staying out of his way. But your mother tried to steal it from him. And that just angered him more. [a pause]Now our kin are dead and the people of the Frontier are murdered and imprisoned.

Id: [0x0006DC3A]
But my mother. She said--

Id: [0x0006DC3B]
Your mother was a fool. Full of ideals and bull-headed. [a beat]Now that King George's power has been threatened, he is making slaves of everyone! [a pause]Ratonhnhak√©:ton, it falls to you to make good on your mother's mistake. Journey to the Great Willow, climb her, retrieve the virgin boughs in her canopy. Drink their essence and gain the power to fight, to bring down this mad King George.

Id: [0x0006DC52]
How?

Id: [0x0006DC53]
Gather your strength and I will show you.

Id: [0x0006DCA4]
Get as far away from town as possible! Find shelter in the forest!

Id: [0x0006DCA6]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006DCA8]
There!

Id: [0x0006DCAB]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! We must move swiftly!

Id: [0x0006DCAD]
Make haste!

Id: [0x0006DCAF]
What are you doing?! Hurry!

Id: [0x0006DCB2]
The King's army is advancing! Use this gun to stop them!

Id: [0x0006DCB4]
You! I need your help! Help me load the cannon!

Id: [0x0006DCB9]
They are retreating! We have done it!

Id: [0x0006DCBA]
Washington's troops do not retreat - they advance or die. To Lexington, we will have a better vantage point from there.

Id: [0x0006DCC1]
There she is! The savage that tried to steal this, the source and symbol of my power!

Id: [0x0006DCC5]
Commander Washington! Why are you doing this? After all we accomplished! Take hold of your senses!

Id: [0x0006DCC6]
[laugh]Another delusional savage. I have never had such a firm grasp on my senses. [a beat]Now bend your knee to your monarch, and make penitence in the last moments before you are blasted to your dread reward.

Id: [0x0006DCC8]
There's more! Stop them!

Id: [0x0006DCCC]
He tried to destroy the entire town. It is all my fault.

Id: [0x0006DCCD]
I do not understand. Washington knows me. He is a man of reason, if nothing else. But that was not the man I once called my friend.

Id: [0x0006DCCE]
Are you confused? When would you have ever met that monster?

Id: [0x0006DCD2]
Get on that horse.

Id: [0x0006DCDA]
You will pay!

Id: [0x0006DCDB]
Fighting. Near the Great Willow.

Id: [0x0006DCE0]
Mad King George is on a warpath and intends to destroy our village. We need every able body to protect it, come with us.

Id: [0x0006DCE4]
We know. Oi√°:ner  sent us to collect boughs of the Great Willow. She means for us to defend our people.

Id: [0x0006DCE5]
To make the tea?! Has she lost her senses?! The tea's pitfalls overshadow its power. You must not do it.

Id: [0x0006DCE6]
You have seen what it can do? [a beat]Is it dangerous?

Id: [0x0006DCE7]
I have seen it. It is worse than dangerous, it is a promise of madness, even death for those lacking the constitution.

Id: [0x0006DCE8]
We cannot disobey the Clan Mother.

Id: [0x0006DCE9]
Believe me, the tea of the Great Willow is folly. Come back with us.

Id: [0x0006DCEB]
We will fulfill the Clan Mother's request. We will collect the boughs. Speak to Oi√°:ner  and if you can convince her, we will burn them.

Id: [0x0006DCEC]
I intend to.

Id: [0x0006DCEF]
What is the Tea of the Great Willow?

Id: [0x0006DCF0]
Something our people should never have discovered. It is the tea brewed of the Great Willow's virgin boughs and consumed by our warriors. It grants certain - strengths, Ratonhnhak√©:ton, but for every physical boon it gives, it robs a piece of the mind. It must never be made.

Id: [0x0006DCF1]
Did you drink it?

Id: [0x0006DCF2]
Never. But I have seen what happens to those who do. You are the son of a man of violence. It would affect you far more than anyone else.  I will not allow you to drink it.

Id: [0x0006DCF5]
You intend to brew tea of the Great Willow? Have you forgotten the consequence of drinking it? I have not.

Id: [0x0006DCF6]
No, Kanieht√≠:io, but when our people face a threat like the Mad King, there are no other paths.

Id: [0x0006DCF7]
No other paths? We can fight them as human beings! My son and I have had success just the two of us. Imagine the strength of our whole village.

Id: [0x0006DCF8]
And how many of these fearless Bluecoats have you brought down at a time? Two? Five? Ten? Thousands will come to destroy us - thousands that YOU awoke. [a pause]Our people's survival depends on the strength of the Great Willow.

Id: [0x0006DCF9]
You are as mad as the King. [a beat]Do what you will but my son will not drink the tea.

Id: [0x0006DCFA]
Then, like you, [a beat]he will die.[breath]

Id: [0x0006DCFE]
Stupid old woman!

Id: [0x0006DCFF]
What would you have us do, mother? We have no choice but to fight.

Id: [0x0006DD00]
I know. I have something that will help. Something from your father.

Id: [0x0006DD01]
My father?

Id: [0x0006DD02]
He left it for you long ago, before he died.

Id: [0x0006DD07]
My father left those for me?

Id: [0x0006DD08]
He was part of an order. A secret brotherhood--

Id: [0x0006DD09]
I know who my father was and I know what those are.

Id: [0x0006DD0A]
You do?

Id: [0x0006DD0C]
They will certainly help.

Id: [0x0006DD0D]
How do you know all this?

Id: [0x0006DD10]
He is here!

Id: [0x0006DD14]
Give no quarter to the savages!

Id: [0x0006DD15]
Burn it to the ground!

Id: [0x0006DD17]
[fear and pain scream]

Id: [0x0006DD19]
[breath]MOTHER!

Id: [0x0006DD1B]
Washington![breath]

Id: [0x0006DD21]
You are ready. The Great Willow at the top of the mountain.

Id: [0x0006DD24]
Yes. I will return with the boughs and perhaps some fresh meat to cook.

Id: [0x0006DD25]
[grunt]Never mind the meat. Just bring back the branches, boil them in water and drink the tea. [a beat]Only then will you be ready to return and fight back with your brothers.

Id: [0x0006DD26]
Drink her strength. Become one of us.

Id: [0x0006DD28]
Leave no tracks leading here upon your return. Go.

Id: [0x0006DD31]
I am sorry, Mother. I must speak to Washington, to make sense of this. It is the only way.[drinking][cough]

Id: [0x0006DD33]
[cough]

Id: [0x0006DD36]
[moaning in pain]

Id: [0x0006DD38]
Oi√°:ner !

Id: [0x0006DD39]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Arnold's men followed your trail back here. Your brothers fought well but there were too many.

Id: [0x0006DD3B]
Respect the power of the tea, Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Your mother was right to worry about the danger.

Id: [0x0006DD3C]
I'm certain I can defeat anyone!

Id: [0x0006DD3D]
Good. First kill Arnold and stop the destruction here. Then kill Washington. You must succeed, Ratonhnhak√©:ton. If not you...nobody.

Id: [0x0006DD41]
Each man is as mad as the next. Putnam gutted a man yesterday for having dirt in his musket. I'm all for weeding out the weak but this is something else entirely. Be careful lad, we're on the right side but that doesn't mean we're safe.

Id: [0x0006DD47]
[laugh]You!? You survived? How astonishing.

Id: [0x0006DD76]
I met him ... I ... Mother, this is all wrong. Washington, the violence, all of it!

Id: [0x0006DD77]
We must get back and warn our people in the village before the Mad King spreads his destruction there.

Id: [0x0006DD79]
Take that horse, Ratonhnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x0006DD7A]
I can not explain. [a beat]Everything is all wrong here! All of this should NOT BE. YOU should not be. [a beat]I watched you-

Id: [0x0006DD7B]
We dealt with those savages like we was supposed to. Tough as nails, they was. But we brought them down. Felt good. We have nothing to worry about.

Id: [0x0006DD7D]
We've got one more day in this place before we're relieved. And then it‚Äôs off to the Valley Forge awaiting orders from Commander Putnam.

Id: [0x0006DD7E]
Where's Arnold then?

Id: [0x0006DD7F]
He gone off into some sort of seclusion until the King sets his plans. Putnam is acting commander until Arnold comes back.

Id: [0x0006DD8B]
I must speak with Arnold myself.

Id: [0x0006DD8C]
Yes sir. I'll arrange a detail to escort you immediately.

Id: [0x0006DD9B]
I do not need one. [a beat]You are acting commanding officer in my absence. If anything should go wrong ... well, your widow will be provided for. [a pause]Dismissed.

Id: [0x0006DDA2]
Need some support! Something's out here! Get a look-out in the tower!

Id: [0x0006DDA7]
There!

Id: [0x0006DDA9]
Intruder!

Id: [0x0006DDAB]
He's here! He's here!

Id: [0x0006DDAD]
Something's out here. I can feel it.

Id: [0x0006DDAF]
I know someone's watching me.

Id: [0x0006DDB1]
Stay sharp, boys.

Id: [0x0006DDB2]
[pain grunts]

Id: [0x0006DDB4]
I got a bad feeling.

Id: [0x0006DDB6]
I heard something over here.

Id: [0x0006DDB8]
Come out and fight!

Id: [0x0006DDBC]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x0006DDBD]
You killed a man for having a smudge on his musket.

Id: [0x0006DDBE]
Imperfection will not be tolerated.

Id: [0x0006DDBF]
Very well. I sincerely hope the rest of our men remain perfect, otherwise our army will dwindle without the glory of combat.

Id: [0x0006DDC0]
Things are in order. It‚Äôs not as if they have much choice in the matter.

Id: [0x0006DDC1]
How is progress?

Id: [0x0006DDC2]
We've cleansed the east of the Mohawk savages. Our columns are readying to march west.

Id: [0x0006DDC3]
Good. [a beat]Increase the number of drills. [a beat]The men must be in perfect order.

Id: [0x0006DDC5]
I have waited a long time to end your treachery. You escaped me once, but today you die.

Id: [0x0006DDC6]
Who are you? What is happening?

Id: [0x0006DDC7]
You know who I am.

Id: [0x0006DDC8]
I've never seen you before in my life! [a pause]Washington's apple. He uses it to control men you... you have to believe me. I... I was not in my right mind.

Id: [0x0006DDC9]
What you did at West Point was of no one's mind but yours.

Id: [0x0006DDCA]
West Point? I... I've never set foot in that fort in my life.[swallows] Please. [swallows]Washington, he‚Äôs gone mad. You, you have to bring him down. He‚Äôs no more a man but a monster. Find Benjamin Franklin in Boston. He can help you - but you have to, you have to free him.

Id: [0x0006DDCD]
Don‚Äôt be so sure.

Id: [0x0006DDCE]
Free him from where? [a pause]Where?

Id: [0x0006DDD0]
Are you the one?![effort]

Id: [0x0006DDD2]
Thief! [a beat]You tried to steal the source of his power![effort]

Id: [0x0006DDD4]
The King said to find a Mohawk girl with braids. You're a Mohawk. And you have braids.

Id: [0x0006DDD6]
Please! Please! [a beat]There are women and children in there! Are you a monster?! Do not do this!

Id: [0x0006DDD7]
You had your chance.

Id: [0x0006DDD9]
What are you doing?! We must stop them!

Id: [0x0006DDDB]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! Hurry!

Id: [0x0006DDDD]
That's one! Two more!

Id: [0x0006DDDF]
There's one left! Over there!

Id: [0x0006DDE0]
This way. It will be faster.

Id: [0x0006DDE1]
Run! To the forest!

Id: [0x0006DDE3]
Get out of here! They will show you no mercy!

Id: [0x0006DDE5]
You must flee!

Id: [0x0006DDE8]
You are consumed by madness!

Id: [0x0006DDEA]
I will end you for all you've done!

Id: [0x0006DDF2]
I thought the tea...

Id: [0x0006DDF3]
Gives strength, not immortality.

Id: [0x0006DDF8]
You best stop moving.

Id: [0x0006DE32]
No man should possess a power so absolute.

Id: [0x0006DE33]
Sink it into the sea. Weight it and sink it to the bottom-most reaches of the ocean!

Id: [0x0006DE34]
As you wish, Commander.

Id: [0x0006DE36]
William! Prepare the coach. We shall return to Mount Vernon.

Id: [0x0006DE38]
Better than alright.

Id: [0x0006DE3B]
Gaze upon it! For it will be the last object you will ever see! [a beat]I come here to destroy both you and your sad village, for none like you will be allowed to live.

Id: [0x0006DE85]
Corporal! Take care of them.

Id: [0x0006DE87]
General Putnam, General Arnold. I sometimes despair of our project. I question my abilities and my strength. But with you two at my side, I believe we will bring liberty to this country and we will bring it with fists of iron! Can I have assurance of your loyalty?

Id: [0x0006DE88]
You have my solemn pledge.

Id: [0x0006DE89]
And mine.

Id: [0x0006DE8A]
Thank you, honorable gentlemen. This country will remember you.

Id: [0x0006DE8C]
You'll not succeed here!

Id: [0x0006DE8E]
This time, I'll make certain of your death.

Id: [0x0006DEB1]
[breath]Got you.

Id: [0x0006DEB4]
Oh yes. [a pause]You will make for quite the gift!

Id: [0x0006DED1]
[effort breath]Was it just a dream? Could I... Could I actually ...?

Id: [0x0006DED4]
No one can stop me with such a power!

Id: [0x0006DED5]
I must tell the Clan Mother. I can do anything now!

Id: [0x0006DED6]
It gives me life! I've never felt anything like it!

Id: [0x0006DED7]
You must be careful.

Id: [0x0006DFD6]
You have to understand. It was as if my very thoughts were controlled. I simply could not think for myself!

Id: [0x0006DFF6]
Wait here. I will let you through when it is clear.

Id: [0x0006E003]
I've got a present for you, Your Highness.

Id: [0x0006E009]
Our beacon! ... Yes, yes. Our beacon. It watches over us. We love our King. He watches over ... us!

Id: [0x0006E00A]
A present?

Id: [0x0006E00B]
No, it's news to me. What sort of present, General Putnam?

Id: [0x0006E00C]
The best sort. Come see!

Id: [0x0006E00E]
It's the one you blasted point blank in the village, sire.

Id: [0x0006E00F]
Really?[a beat] He survived?[a beat] Remarkable.

Id: [0x0006E011]
Rouse him!

Id: [0x0006E013]
Yes, well, I've captured one myself, sire. In the next cell. A savage who joined that traitor, Sam Adams.

Id: [0x0006E014]
Have them both beheaded, [a pause]along with a score of citizens taken at random, as an example to all.

Id: [0x0006E015]
Random citizens? Isn't that rather harsh, Your Majesty?

Id: [0x0006E016]
"Harsh," sir!? Is it harsh to defend our freedoms? Is it harsh to extinguish those who would enslave us? Mr. Franklin, I suggest you examine your commitment to the cause, sir!

Id: [0x0006E017]
Yes, yes, of course, Your Majesty.

Id: [0x0006E018]
Have the scaffolds made ready.

Id: [0x0006E019]
My Liege.

Id: [0x0006E01B]
Putnam, I fear Mr. Franklin is going soft. See to it that this so-called rebellion is crushed, and I'll consider rearranging just who is in charge.

Id: [0x0006E01C]
I already have a plan, My Lord.

Id: [0x0006E01D]
As for you...[a pause] Let's see how you survive[a beat] with the loss of your head! Eh?[laugh] Carry on, Putnam!

Id: [0x0006E01E]
Yes, Your Highness.

Id: [0x0006E020]
Stay sharp, soldier!

Id: [0x0006E022]
Our King is our beacon.

Id: [0x0006E024]
Help! He's escaped! I need help!

Id: [0x0006E025]
What's going on?

Id: [0x0006E026]
Shut up, you! Help!

Id: [0x0006E029]
What's happened?

Id: [0x0006E02A]
He was here, then gone! There must be a hole or something.

Id: [0x0006E032]
Hey! Anyone alive? Get me out of here!

Id: [0x0006E03B]
You'll have a nice view tomorrow, with your head up high on a pike and all!

Id: [0x0006E03D]
Don't you dare try anything! I've got my eye on you, I do.

Id: [0x0006E041]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton?

Id: [0x0006E044]
And you! They said you have been killed. Along with your mother.

Id: [0x0006E045]
The Clan Mother brought me to health. Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon, I was unable to protect my mother. I was unable to save the village.

Id: [0x0006E048]
I'm very sorry, Ratonhnhak√©:ton. It has been difficult here as well. I fight with Sam Adams' rebels, but we are too few and too weak. But hurry! Get me out!

Id: [0x0006E049]
Washington is enslaving the people and looting everything. He ships the slaves and treasure to New York to build his palace. The rebels tried to free some slaves, but we were ambushed and I was captured.

Id: [0x0006E04A]
This is not everything.

Id: [0x0006E04D]
All right. Let's find the rest.

Id: [0x0006E05B]
What is that?

Id: [0x0006E05C]
From the Red Willow.

Id: [0x0006E060]
Ah![a beat] That is how you can move as you do. You went on a Sky Journey.

Id: [0x0006E067]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006E069]
Bluecoats![breathing] They've sounded the alarm![breathing] Did you see a spirit?[a beat] Are you all right?

Id: [0x0006E06A]
I never felt better.

Id: [0x0006E06E]
Get your shoulder into it!

Id: [0x0006E070]
Break it! Break the goddamn door!

Id: [0x0006E074]
Put some muscle on it, you lily-livered cod!

Id: [0x0006E077]
They're crazed savages! Kill them, or Washington will have our heads!

Id: [0x0006E079]
Or at least mine.

Id: [0x0006E07E]
Those are the savages! Attack!

Id: [0x0006E080]
I'll take the Bluecoats! You stop Franklin!

Id: [0x0006E088]
You!? And where ...? I ... I don't understand. Who am I?

Id: [0x0006E089]
Why did Arnold say that you could help me?

Id: [0x0006E08A]
Is this me? It is! This is myself! I‚Äôve,  I've come to myself! ... My god, what have I done?

Id: [0x0006E08C]
I don't care for those who meddle in my plans.

Id: [0x0006E090]
In the end, your mother didn't put up much of a fight.

Id: [0x0006E092]
You couldn't save your village, how can you save yourself?

Id: [0x0006E094]
I shall kill you the same way I killed your mother.

Id: [0x0006E096]
Where were you when my men were slaughtering your friends?

Id: [0x0006E098]
It's all falling away,[a beat] falling away,[a beat] falling away!

Id: [0x0006E09A]
Maybe I don't have to free Franklin from a prison. I have to free him from Washington's power.

Id: [0x0006E09E]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! What happened?

Id: [0x0006E09F]
I had him! I had Franklin! Then ... Washington ... I ... I do not know.

Id: [0x0006E0A0]
Washington?

Id: [0x0006E0A4]
Young man, do you need a doctor?

Id: [0x0006E0A7]
We fight, but times are hard. We can use your assistance.

Id: [0x0006E0A8]
Come Ratonhnhak√©:ton, we should all get out of here. We have a place that is safe.

Id: [0x0006E0AE]
We'll be trapped in this alley if Franklin comes with reinforcements.

Id: [0x0006E0AF]
Like last time. [a beat]Ratonhnhak√©:ton! I'm told you're an extraordinary hunter - able to track anything or anyone.

Id: [0x0006E0B0]
Samuel Adams!

Id: [0x0006E0B2]
I admire the work you have done, and are doing now.

Id: [0x0006E0B4]
I could use such a man. I fought for years in the cause of freedom. I thought that Washington would lead us to a new age! But he turned, and I had to start again. Sadly, our second rebellion is faltering ...

Id: [0x0006E0B5]
But this time we must avoid being surprised by that murderer, Franklin.

Id: [0x0006E0B6]
If I had a man who could track Franklin down  while we attempt to free our friends, it would disorient the Bluecoats and ensure our success.

Id: [0x0006E0B7]
I have my own reasons to get Franklin.

Id: [0x0006E0B8]
Capital! We have an accordance of desires.

Id: [0x0006E0BA]
From time to time we get important information from this tavern right here. Your appearance draws attention, but if you‚Äôre able to mingle with the denizens, you should be able to discover Franklin's movements.

Id: [0x0006E0BB]
I didn't think they served savages in here.

Id: [0x0006E0BD]
There's a stray wolf in our midst, eh? Ha!

Id: [0x0006E0BF]
That one should be in a slave camp.

Id: [0x0006E0C1]
He must've wandered in looking for his wolf pack.

Id: [0x0006E0C3]
Care for a game?

Id: [0x0006E0C4]
It's much better than cards, don't you think? I remember -

Id: [0x0006E0C5]
Hey! I'm trying to concentrate.

Id: [0x0006E0C6]
Fine. Just being sociable. Sheesh.

Id: [0x0006E0C7]
Are you going to take all day?

Id: [0x0006E0C9]
We don't have all night, pal.

Id: [0x0006E0CB]
Did you move yet? I almost dozed off there.

Id: [0x0006E0CD]
There's somethin' fishy about this fella!

Id: [0x0006E0CF]
Just who are you, anyway?

Id: [0x0006E0D1]
I don't like the looks a' this one.

Id: [0x0006E0D3]
Jimminy! Ol' Franklin's sending me out with another message!

Id: [0x0006E0D4]
Oh, you're in for it now.

Id: [0x0006E0D5]
Something big is up. Only one ale for me. I have to get this to Putnam's lieutenant, or it's the whip. Or maybe worse!

Id: [0x0006E0D7]
General Putnam. There appears to be a misunderstanding regarding our respective positions and authorities. A personal meeting is called for: at the docks, tomorrow, ten at night. The usual sentinels will secure our safety. Yours, Ben. Franklin.

Id: [0x0006E0D8]
Who are you?

Id: [0x0006E0D9]
General Putnam is unable to meet with you.

Id: [0x0006E0DA]
What? Well, this is absurd! Washington will hear of this.

Id: [0x0006E0DB]
King Washington? His Majesty has removed himself to New York city to deal with the rebellion festering there.

Id: [0x0006E0DC]
Removed himself? Why wasn't I informed!?

Id: [0x0006E0DD]
General Putnam asked me to deliver this  proclamation from the King.

Id: [0x0006E0DE]
"This attests that Israel Putnam is heretofore to ..." What is this?!

Id: [0x0006E0DF]
From now on, you take orders from Putnam.

Id: [0x0006E0E0]
Me, take orders from him!? I suggest you show me some respect sir, or I'll have these men shoot you down! Sentinels!

Id: [0x0006E0E2]
Sentinels! ... But ...?

Id: [0x0006E0E3]
Aaaaah!

Id: [0x0006E0E4]
(moans of pain)

Id: [0x0006E0E6]
Hold still.

Id: [0x0006E0E8]
Aaaaah!

Id: [0x0006E0E9]
Come with me.

Id: [0x0006E0EB]
My God. What have we done? I became a monster. It was as if Washington had some, some great power.

Id: [0x0006E0EC]
Come on!

Id: [0x0006E0EE]
He clouded my mind ... he, he ...

Id: [0x0006E0EF]
I don't want to hear it. Come with me!

Id: [0x0006E0F1]
Don't kill me! Not now that I've come to my senses!

Id: [0x0006E0F3]
My only wish is to atone for my wickedness. I will devote every moment to destroying the King!

Id: [0x0006E0F5]
I did monstrous things. Monstrous! I repent of those. I was literally a different man!

Id: [0x0006E0F7]
Are you taking me somewhere to be killed? But I can help you now!

Id: [0x0006E0F9]
I pledge to you. I pledge my life! I will sacrifice myself to bring Washington to justice.

Id: [0x0006E0FA]
If I let you live?

Id: [0x0006E0FB]
How?

Id: [0x0006E14B]
I can change that, if you'll tell me what needs to be done.

Id: [0x0006E150]
Then we'll rush the guards and set sail.

Id: [0x0006E19C]
Aaaah!

Id: [0x0006E1A4]
Sam and Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon have gone with what's left of the men to Boston Neck. I hope they make it.

Id: [0x0006E1A5]
We should join them as soon as we can.

Id: [0x0006E1A6]
First, I must melt this down. Then I need the diagram of my design. I left it with an officer as a kind of insurance policy. He can almost always be found at the tavern. Get that and I can file this shape to the correct precision.

Id: [0x0006E1A7]
Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon. I have lost you a second time, my friend.

Id: [0x0006E1A9]
This should get us close to Washington. [a pause]By heavens, what happened?

Id: [0x0006E1AA]
Boston Neck was a trap set by Putnam.

Id: [0x0006E1AB]
And Adams? ... Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon?

Id: [0x0006E1AC]
Everyone killed.

Id: [0x0006E1AD]
Killed? [a pause]We'll be next! We've got to get out of here!

Id: [0x0006E1AE]
The land routes are cut off.[a beat] We must escape by sea.

Id: [0x0006E1AF]
Yes! By sea! I know of an excellent ship, but I'm too well known to move about freely.

Id: [0x0006E1B1]
Hm. Bit of a tight fit, you know. How do I look?

Id: [0x0006E1B3]
Ridiculous.

Id: [0x0006E1B4]
You don't have to be so honest.

Id: [0x0006E1B6]
Mister Faulkner! Sir!

Id: [0x0006E1B7]
Who's that? Do I ...? Franklin!?

Id: [0x0006E1B8]
Don't let the disguise fool you.

Id: [0x0006E1BA]
You goddamn ...! Your men stole my ship, you shite!

Id: [0x0006E1BB]
Gah! Help!

Id: [0x0006E1BD]
Easy, Mr. Faulkner. Mr. Franklin is on the side of the rebels, now.

Id: [0x0006E1BE]
We need your help.

Id: [0x0006E1BF]
And why should I?

Id: [0x0006E1C0]
You'll get your ship back.

Id: [0x0006E1C1]
Ah! ... The goddamn wharf's too heavily guarded.

Id: [0x0006E1C4]
Well, let's see. I'll need you to untie the Aquila so it's all set to go. Meantime, I can scare you up a small crew.

Id: [0x0006E1E0]
We will speak to Adams about this.

Id: [0x0006E1E1]
Mr. Adams. I have a prisoner.

Id: [0x0006E1E3]
Franklin! [a beat]You bastard! [a beat]Take him out, have him shot!

Id: [0x0006E1E7]
No, no, Sam! I've come to my senses! I want to help!

Id: [0x0006E1E9]
No.[a beat] I believe he will help us. The only way to end this is to get to Washington. And Franklin knows Washington well.

Id: [0x0006E1EA]
I created a very special means of protection for Washington's palace. An attack there would be completely unexpected.

Id: [0x0006E1EB]
This is absurd.

Id: [0x0006E1EC]
You will need a metal of a specific weight. There's a blacksmith in town, loyal to me, he'll help you.

Id: [0x0006E1F6]
I will get Franklin's metal and we will catch up with you.

Id: [0x0006E1F9]
This is a fool's errand, my friend, but I hope to see you in New York.

Id: [0x0006E1FB]
What can I do for you, Mister?

Id: [0x0006E1FC]
Benjamin Franklin has sent me. [a beat]He asks something of you.

Id: [0x0006E1FD]
Franklin?

Id: [0x0006E1FE]
He tells me you have an unusual metal. [a beat]He would like you to give that to me.

Id: [0x0006E200]
Well, thing about that is ...

Id: [0x0006E201]
The metal, please.

Id: [0x0006E202]
Fella came along the other day wanted his horse shod. Times bein‚Äô what they are, I was clean out a' iron. Man's got a right to feed his children, don't he? Sorry, mister.

Id: [0x0006E203]
You used it for horse shoes?

Id: [0x0006E204]
Hi. Looked good, too. Real good. Feller rode away looking fine. Works in the citadel, that one.

Id: [0x0006E209]
Benjamin Franklin sent me to you.

Id: [0x0006E20A]
Sorry, my friend. You want something, you've got to beat me.

Id: [0x0006E20B]
I do not have a lot of time.

Id: [0x0006E20C]
Did you hear about the little fracas went down tonight?

Id: [0x0006E20F]
Bunch a' fellers got suckered by Putnam. Pretty funny.

Id: [0x0006E212]
Yep, ol' Putnam tricked those Redcoats into comin' out all in a group to Boston Neck, then just mowed those stupid saps down.

Id: [0x0006E213]
That's it!

Id: [0x0006E215]
Get 'im, boys!

Id: [0x0006E219]
The Aquila is ready. Do you have a crew?

Id: [0x0006E21A]
They're sailors! They do nothing but fight!

Id: [0x0006E21B]
Let's go.

Id: [0x0006E21C]
Swim! I'll hold them off until you're ready to sail!

Id: [0x0006E21D]
Swim lads! Swim!

Id: [0x0006E21E]
One move, just one move, and he's dead. [a beat]Call back your men and give yourself up.

Id: [0x0006E21F]
Swim, Ratonhnhak√©:ton! Go!

Id: [0x0006E221]
Shut it!

Id: [0x0006E222]
(whimpers)

Id: [0x0006E223]
I've done such horrible deeds. ... it's the scepter, but ... that's no excuse. Every man holds evil deep within. The apple just brought it out.

Id: [0x0006E228]
The key should be in his pocket.

Id: [0x0006E22A]
I will meet you at the Red Willow tree.

Id: [0x0006E22C]
You are on your own now.

Id: [0x0006E22F]
We are very grateful.

Id: [0x0006E230]
I would help you with your people, but I must get to Valley Forge.

Id: [0x0006E231]
Once everyone is safe at the refugee camp north of here, I will join you at Valley Forge to help you to repay your kindness.

Id: [0x0006E232]
No need, but if I see you there, I will be happy for your help.

Id: [0x0006E233]
You may find other camps full of our enslaved people. They are sad reminders of Arnold's terror and devastation.

Id: [0x0006E234]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006E236]
It's very dangerous here.

Id: [0x0006E238]
Guards, everywhere. They stalk the edges of the camp with dogs. These are very good dogs, Ratonhnhak√©:ton, alert with sharp eyes. If you get even many yards away from them, they yowl and bring the soldiers.

Id: [0x0006E239]
Thank you. It's not safe here. Go home. You have repaid my kindness.

Id: [0x0006E23A]
You will succeed, Ratonhnhak√©:ton. Good-bye.

Id: [0x0006E23C]
We are so grateful.

Id: [0x0006E23D]
You have saved our very lives.

Id: [0x0006E23F]
Good work.

Id: [0x0006E240]
We were in a pickle there. Thanks.

Id: [0x0006E242]
Much obliged, young man.

Id: [0x0006E243]
We were headed for the slave camps.

Id: [0x0006E245]
We thank you, brave warrior.

Id: [0x0006E246]
You have our gratitude.

Id: [0x0006E248]
You fought well.

Id: [0x0006E249]
Nice to be out of that coop. Thanks.

Id: [0x0006E24B]
You have done a great thing today.

Id: [0x0006E24C]
I am in your debt.

Id: [0x0006E24E]
Kill them all.

Id: [0x0006E24F]
Give them what they deserve!

Id: [0x0006E250]
Ratohnhate:ton! Get them!

Id: [0x0006E251]
Kill the brutes!

Id: [0x0006E252]
That will teach you!

Id: [0x0006E253]
That's it!

Id: [0x0006E254]
Tomahawk him!

Id: [0x0006E255]
We will be free!

Id: [0x0006E256]
Watch out!

Id: [0x0006E257]
Make 'em pay!

Id: [0x0006E258]
Send 'em to hell!

Id: [0x0006E259]
They deserve to die!

Id: [0x0006E25A]
They can't stop him!

Id: [0x0006E25B]
He's too fast for them.

Id: [0x0006E25C]
Don't let any get away!

Id: [0x0006E25D]
Free us, Ratohnhake:ton!

Id: [0x0006E25E]
They're helpless against him!

Id: [0x0006E25F]
Get them!

Id: [0x0006E260]
We are saved! Come free us!

Id: [0x0006E261]
Good fighting. Now let us out.

Id: [0x0006E262]
Come open the cage!

Id: [0x0006E263]
Let us out!

Id: [0x0006E264]
Open up the cage!

Id: [0x0006E265]
He can free us now!

Id: [0x0006E266]
Break this lock!

Id: [0x0006E267]
Now we can go free!

Id: [0x0006E268]
Free us!

Id: [0x0006E269]
All right, let us go!

Id: [0x0006E26A]
Bust us out of here!

Id: [0x0006E26B]
I'm gonna be so glad to get out of this damn thing.

Id: [0x0006E26C]
Now you can break us out of here.

Id: [0x0006E26D]
Break the cage open!

Id: [0x0006E26E]
Let us out!

Id: [0x0006E26F]
Now open the cage!

Id: [0x0006E270]
Let us go free!

Id: [0x0006E271]
Come open this cage.

Id: [0x0006E272]
Come back! We're still locked in!

Id: [0x0006E275]
Help! We need to be let out!

Id: [0x0006E278]
Don't forget us!

Id: [0x0006E27B]
Hey! Where are you going? Open this cage!

Id: [0x0006E27E]
Come back here!

Id: [0x0006E281]
Don't go! We need to be freed!

Id: [0x0006E284]
Will someone please help us?

Id: [0x0006E285]
These men are monsters!

Id: [0x0006E286]
We are innocent!

Id: [0x0006E287]
You can't do this to us!

Id: [0x0006E288]
What are you going to do?! Help!

Id: [0x0006E289]
We've done nothing! Nothing at all!

Id: [0x0006E28A]
We ain't but poor folk!

Id: [0x0006E28B]
Leave us alone!

Id: [0x0006E28C]
Help us! The Bluecoats have got us!

Id: [0x0006E293]
We're very grateful.

Id: [0x0006E294]
You've saved us, kind sir!

Id: [0x0006E295]
We were in dire trouble, there. Many thanks.

Id: [0x0006E296]
Those bastards were going to kill us. We're thankful for the help.

Id: [0x0006E297]
We're damn lucky you came along!

Id: [0x0006E298]
They had it in for us. We're in your debt.

Id: [0x0006E299]
Someone! Please! They're going to hurt me!

Id: [0x0006E29A]
Help! Anybody please!

Id: [0x0006E29B]
Help! Bluecoats!

Id: [0x0006E29C]
Over here! Save me from these beasts!

Id: [0x0006E29D]
Stay away from me, you dirty louts!

Id: [0x0006E29E]
I need help! Drunken Bluecoats!

Id: [0x0006E29F]
They're gonna kill me! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2A0]
Get away, you filthy Bluecoat! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2A1]
Come on then, ya cowardly Bluecoat!

Id: [0x0006E2A2]
He's there!

Id: [0x0006E2A3]
It's the ghost, men!

Id: [0x0006E2A4]
Came out of the blue.

Id: [0x0006E2A8]
He's there!

Id: [0x0006E2A9]
Look right there.

Id: [0x0006E2AA]
How'd he get there?

Id: [0x0006E2AB]
Quick! Over there!

Id: [0x0006E2AC]
Right there, lads!

Id: [0x0006E2AD]
Great Christ! There!

Id: [0x0006E2AE]
I feared for my very life. Thank you.

Id: [0x0006E2AF]
It's always the same with them. Pure luck you arrived.

Id: [0x0006E2B0]
I'm still alive![a beat]Thanks to you.

Id: [0x0006E2B1]
I thought I was done for. Ah! You have my thanks.

Id: [0x0006E2B2]
They were gonna string me up! Good thing you were there.

Id: [0x0006E2B3]
Those bastards. Glad to be done with them!

Id: [0x0006E2B4]
Help! Somebody, help me! I'm being mauled!

Id: [0x0006E2B5]
Help me! Wolves!

Id: [0x0006E2B6]
Aaah! I'm being attacked by wolves!

Id: [0x0006E2B7]
There's too many! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2B8]
Good god, look at all these wolves! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2B9]
Help! There's too many! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2BA]
Help! There's too many of 'em!

Id: [0x0006E2BB]
For the love of god, help!

Id: [0x0006E2BC]
I'm being eaten alive!

Id: [0x0006E2BD]
I'm being eaten by wolves!

Id: [0x0006E2BE]
Save me!

Id: [0x0006E2BF]
Wolves! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2C0]
Aah! Wolf pack! Help me!

Id: [0x0006E2C1]
Wolves! I need help!

Id: [0x0006E2C2]
Help me! I can't hold them off!

Id: [0x0006E2C3]
A pack of wolves! Come help me!

Id: [0x0006E2C4]
Wolves! Damn! Help!

Id: [0x0006E2C5]
Is there anyone to help me?!

Id: [0x0006E2C6]
I lost my tomahawk. I could not stop them alone.

Id: [0x0006E2C7]
Thank you, my friend.

Id: [0x0006E2C8]
You saved me from a terrible death.

Id: [0x0006E2C9]
A few more minutes and I wouldn't be alive. Thank you.

Id: [0x0006E2CA]
I'm so glad you heard me and came running.

Id: [0x0006E2CB]
They would have torn me to shreds. You have my thanks.

Id: [0x0006E2CC]
That was a close one, that was.

Id: [0x0006E2CD]
Much obliged, son.

Id: [0x0006E2CE]
You done saved my life.

Id: [0x0006E2CF]
I was in a tight spot there. Thanks.

Id: [0x0006E2D0]
They caught me by surprise. Thanks for coming so quickly.

Id: [0x0006E2D1]
I should have killed them myself, but I am sick and weak. Thank you.

Id: [0x0006E5F2]
Could I have a crust of bread? Anything?

Id: [0x0006E5F3]
Mister, I'm starving. You don't have a small bite to eat?

Id: [0x0006E5F4]
Ah! I'm faint from lack of food.

Id: [0x0006E5FB]
Pardon me, you wouldn't have anything to eat for a poor feller, would ya?

Id: [0x0006E5FC]
I'm dying for a bite to eat, my friend.

Id: [0x0006E5FD]
Have you got anything to eat, friend? Anything at all?

Id: [0x0006E5FE]
I'm not gonna make it. I need to eat!

Id: [0x0006E5FF]
I'd give an arm for a crust of bread.

Id: [0x0006E600]
Could I bother you for a bite to eat?

Id: [0x0006E604]
Ah! You've save my life, sir!

Id: [0x0006E605]
Food?! I'm going to cry.

Id: [0x0006E606]
Ah, just what I needed. You've saved a poor, poor soul.

Id: [0x0006E607]
Oh, thank you, sir. I'll take this to my children.

Id: [0x0006E608]
Oh, sir! This will keep me going, sir.

Id: [0x0006E609]
I can't believe it! Food! Oh, thank you!

Id: [0x0006E60A]
Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon! Alive? ... Oh, my friend, I cannot believe you're here!

Id: [0x0006E60C]
Sir, we're out of gunpowder!

Id: [0x0006E60D]
We must leave Boston or be crushed altogether. But I wish to free some comrades to bring with us. Loyal boys, all of them.

Id: [0x0006E60E]
Ah... you are the famous man with the wolf hood.

Id: [0x0006E613]
No! I defied my mother to go on that journey. It is too dangerous.

Id: [0x0006E614]
You may not survive this.

Id: [0x0006E615]
What of the murder of my cousin John? The families of Dorchester? What about the Old North Church that you burned with everyone inside?

Id: [0x0006E616]
All horrible.

Id: [0x0006E617]
Putnam is gone and the Captain at Boston Neck is secretly sympathetic to us. I am sure he will help us if he thinks he can get away with it.

Id: [0x0006E618]
Looks like he must help us in such a way that he will not be caught. ... Perhaps he can triple the soldiers' rum ration. That way, we can catch them drunk at Boston Neck and break through.

Id: [0x0006E61B]
And once in New York, I can be of particular help!

Id: [0x0006E61C]
I don't want to hear it.

Id: [0x0006E61D]
You can get me past these protections?

Id: [0x0006E620]
My dear man. I can be of enormous benefit. I served at Washington's side, I know his habits quite well.

Id: [0x0006E623]
Our beacon, our beacon. He is.

Id: [0x0006E625]
Our beacon watching over us.

Id: [0x0006E627]
Over us, he watches. Our beacon watches.

Id: [0x0006E629]
I don't see a damned thing!

Id: [0x0006E62B]
Ain't nobody here at all!

Id: [0x0006E62D]
Not a blessed thing here!

Id: [0x0006E62F]
There's Franklin!

Id: [0x0006E630]
I do my best.

Id: [0x0006E633]
And here's the worst of it - the message is for Putnam!

Id: [0x0006E634]
Christ! You're a dead mackerel!

Id: [0x0006E635]
Right. With either of those two, there's always some reason to end up flogged!

Id: [0x0006E636]
Franklin will give you the lash, and then Putnam will try to outdo him!

Id: [0x0006E63A]
Oh, it's hot in there! I stoked the brick oven. I've got to get the heat extremely high in order to melt the metal.  Did you get it?

Id: [0x0006E63B]
I hope you have a crowbar.

Id: [0x0006E63C]
What for?

Id: [0x0006E643]
Was that checker player telling the truth? Did Adams run into a trap? I must find out.

Id: [0x0006E648]
Terrible, it was. Terrible! The rebels were overwhelmed, outnumbered four to one. I never seen such slaughter. Piteous, piteous slaughter.

Id: [0x0006E64D]
How dangerous is it?

Id: [0x0006E64E]
Each journey to the Sky World is unlike any other. For some it is very dangerous. You will find your answers are at the very top of the willow.

Id: [0x0006E651]
Stop them from setting off the powder kegs! Kill anyone trying to light the fuses!

Id: [0x0006E655]
There! We must stop them!

Id: [0x0006E656]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! Here they come!

Id: [0x0006E658]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! A Bluecoat over there!

Id: [0x0006E659]
Here comes another one!

Id: [0x0006E65A]
Stop him! He's almost there!

Id: [0x0006E65D]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! The fuse! It's lit!

Id: [0x0006E65E]
Hurry! Put out the fuse!

Id: [0x0006E65F]
The fuse! Put it out!

Id: [0x0006E66C]
Such a great warrior must not be lost to us. [a beat]Of course I will help you.

Id: [0x0006E66F]
The Bluecoats were here! Let's keep searching.

Id: [0x0006E682]
One of the braves, did he have a hand marked on his face?

Id: [0x0006E6A4]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! I am happy to see you.

Id: [0x0006E6A5]
Hello, my friend.

Id: [0x0006E6A6]
Have you seen my brother?

Id: [0x0006E6A7]
I last saw him just before I climbed the Red Willow tree.

Id: [0x0006E6A8]
We were tracking Bluecoats and lost sight of each other. I am worried that he is captured.

Id: [0x0006E6A9]
I fear you may be right.

Id: [0x0006E6AA]
Was your Sky Journey successful?

Id: [0x0006E6AB]
Very successful.

Id: [0x0006E6AC]
Perhaps you can join me in the search for my brother. Any secrets you learned from your journey may be very useful.

Id: [0x0006E6AE]
During your Sky Journey, tell me, what animal called to you?

Id: [0x0006E6AF]
It is difficult to talk about. But I was fortunate to meet the wolf.

Id: [0x0006E6B0]
Ah! You journeyed to a powerful place. You are fortunate.

Id: [0x0006E6B1]
Perhaps.

Id: [0x0006E6B2]
Last I saw my brother, he was right around here.

Id: [0x0006E6B4]
This doesn't look good.

Id: [0x0006E6B5]
This is my brother‚Äôs bow. It is certain that he was here.

Id: [0x0006E6BA]
This isn't right. Could you call on your Spirit Animal? I feel we will need help.

Id: [0x0006E6BB]
I see that I was right. Your Sky Journey has given you a powerful gift. I am certain it will help our search.

Id: [0x0006E6BE]
What d'ya want with me? I didn't do nothin'. Wasn't hurtin' nobody - just huntin' deer! Them other fellers're who you want.

Id: [0x0006E6BF]
What others?

Id: [0x0006E6C0]
Buncha soldiers. [sniff]I know 'em.[a beat] Nasty fellers. [a beat]They was roundin' up injuns over yonder.

Id: [0x0006E6C1]
You mean like a big tattoo across his chin? Yeah, I seen that feller with 'em. Hard to miss.

Id: [0x0006E6C2]
Take us to this camp.

Id: [0x0006E6C3]
Uh, sure. Sure. Whatever you gentlemen want.

Id: [0x0006E6C5]
Help me! Savages! For the love of the King, help!

Id: [0x0006E6C7]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton. The gift of the wolf will help us here.

Id: [0x0006E6C9]
If we follow them, we'll find any other villagers they have captured.

Id: [0x0006E6CA]
I'm all for putting down the savages and all, but this is too much in my book.

Id: [0x0006E6CB]
Arnold is a hard man. But it's left to us to do the deed.

Id: [0x0006E6CC]
Gone too, far, I say. It turns your stomach.

Id: [0x0006E6CD]
Quit mewling you two babies. Let's be done with this. For the glory of the King!

Id: [0x0006E6CE]
We better hurry.

Id: [0x0006E6D0]
Brother!

Id: [0x0006E6D1]
My brother!

Id: [0x0006E6D3]
I knew you'd find us!

Id: [0x0006E6D4]
It is thanks to Ratonhnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x0006E6D5]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! We will make sure that these people are taken care of.

Id: [0x0006E6D6]
You should return to the Clan Mother. She will want to hear of our adventure.

Id: [0x0006E6D7]
Someone, help me! They're going to kill me!

Id: [0x0006E6D9]
Savages! Come help me!

Id: [0x0006E6F1]
Yes.

Id: [0x0006E6F5]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0006E6F6]
If we want to defeat Washington, I will need the strength from the Animal Spirits.

Id: [0x0006E6F7]
We have no choice.

Id: [0x0006E6F8]
But you're risking yourself for nothing! Even with the help of the wolf, I was taken captive.

Id: [0x0006E6F9]
You don't know anything. Every journey holds the chance of meeting a new Animal Spirit.

Id: [0x0006E710]
Wait! Every journey holds the chance of losing yourself. I understand the risks,[A beat] I will take the journey.

Id: [0x0006E8E0]
Use your new gift!

Id: [0x0006E8E1]
Hey!

Id: [0x0006E912]
He is our beacon!

Id: [0x0006E916]
I found an ally, Ratonhnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x0006E917]
Ah! Do I know you?

Id: [0x0006E918]
I ... I know of you, sir.

Id: [0x0006E91A]
Do as I said.

Id: [0x0006E91C]
We've just learned that he is in New York.

Id: [0x0006E91E]
But if we could join Jefferson's rebels in Manhattan, we could attack the King together. But how am I to escape the stranglehold around Boston? The docks are overrun with soldiers.

Id: [0x0006E920]
'Battle' is bein' generous. More like a massacre.

Id: [0x0006E922]
Shootin' fish in a barrel, really.  Dumb fish.

Id: [0x0006E924]
It was quite a battle.

Id: [0x0006E928]
Putnam started a rumor that the Captain of the Guard was friendly to the rebels. Hilarious.

Id: [0x0006E92A]
I was there. I saw ol' Adams take his last breath.

Id: [0x0006E92B]
Savage! Over here!

Id: [0x0006E92E]
Land ho!

Id: [0x0006E931]
Look at that.

Id: [0x0006E933]
I knew your only chance was to leave from the docks. [a beat]He kept turning the wheel.

Id: [0x0006E934]
Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon. I do not care.

Id: [0x0006E936]
If this is delivered, it will lead me to Franklin.

Id: [0x0006E937]
I will find you a disguise.

Id: [0x0006E938]
Excellent idea. In the meanwhile, give me the diagram. I'll file this metal to precision.

Id: [0x0006E939]
They're here.

Id: [0x0006E93A]
Can they fight?

Id: [0x0006E93B]
Go, Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006E93D]
It's not worth it, go!

Id: [0x0006E93F]
Get to the ship!

Id: [0x0006E941]
What is this?

Id: [0x0006E943]
Last chance!

Id: [0x0006E945]
Shut it, savage!

Id: [0x0006E947]
Fine. Have it your way.

Id: [0x0006E948]
You cannot hide from me.

Id: [0x0006E949]
You stand there in plain sight.

Id: [0x0006E94A]
I see your every move.

Id: [0x0006E94B]
You make a perfect target.

Id: [0x0006E94C]
It's a pleasure to see you.

Id: [0x0006E94D]
There's no where to hide.

Id: [0x0006E94E]
Are you just going to stand there in plain sight?

Id: [0x0006E94F]
It's much easier when you don't use your tricks.

Id: [0x0006E950]
No magic this time?

Id: [0x0006E951]
A-ha!

Id: [0x0006E952]
Now I see you!

Id: [0x0006E953]
You're back.

Id: [0x0006E95A]
I pity your earthbound plight.

Id: [0x0006E95B]
Cower on the ground!

Id: [0x0006E95C]
You're helpless, with your feet on the ground, facing my attack.

Id: [0x0006E95D]
Staying right there, eh?

Id: [0x0006E95E]
You cannot get to me.

Id: [0x0006E95F]
Yes, stay firmly on the ground.

Id: [0x0006E960]
You cannot overpower so many.

Id: [0x0006E961]
We are too much for your magic!

Id: [0x0006E962]
You haven't enough strength!

Id: [0x0006E963]
Where have you gone?

Id: [0x0006E964]
What black magic is this?

Id: [0x0006E965]
What?! Where are you?

Id: [0x0006E966]
Vanished into the ether!

Id: [0x0006E967]
Disappear! It won't save you.

Id: [0x0006E968]
Where have you gone this time?

Id: [0x0006E969]
Once more, he disappears!

Id: [0x0006E96A]
Fading from sight only angers me.

Id: [0x0006E96B]
I've seen this trick.

Id: [0x0006E96C]

It is the Eagle Spirit!

Id: [0x0006EB1A]
He has great power.

Id: [0x0006EB1B]
The swiftness of the eagle!

Id: [0x0006EB38]
I will never forgive myself.

Id: [0x0006EB39]
Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon. I do not care.

Id: [0x0006EB3B]
Land ho!

Id: [0x0006EB3E]
Look at that.

Id: [0x0006EB42]
I knew your only chance was to leave from the docks. He kept turning the wheel. I ... I ...

Id: [0x0006EB44]
We sail in there, they'll use us for target practice!

Id: [0x0006EB45]
They don't know who we are.

Id: [0x0006EB46]
We're not flying the King's colors! That makes us the enemy.

Id: [0x0006EB47]
Have they seen us yet, Faulkner?

Id: [0x0006EB48]
I don't think so. We're still in the fog.

Id: [0x0006EB49]
We'll have to turn back!

Id: [0x0006EB4A]
Ships off the port bow!

Id: [0x0006EB4D]
Perhaps we can convince those ships to lend us their flags.

Id: [0x0006EB4E]
We must hurry, before they are seen from shore.

Id: [0x0006EB4F]
Battle stations! Come down on deck, Mister Faulkner! I will take the wheel!

Id: [0x0006EB78]
Pull those in, boys, and we'll hoist 'em up!

Id: [0x0006EB79]
The guns are out of commission!

Id: [0x0006EB7A]
We have no fire power. We will have to ram them.

Id: [0x0006EB7B]
Ram them?

Id: [0x0006EB7C]
Full sail, boys!

Id: [0x0006EB7E]
Aye-aye, Mister Faulkner!

Id: [0x0006EB7F]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0006EB80]
Get off the boat!

Id: [0x0006EB81]
What?!

Id: [0x0006EB82]
Off the boat! Everybody!

Id: [0x0006EB83]
Dive! Dive! Let's go, lads!

Id: [0x0006EB87]
My spectacles! Thank god!

Id: [0x0006EB8A]
Stay away from me!

Id: [0x0006EB8C]
You are useless.

Id: [0x0006EB8F]
There's a tempting target.

Id: [0x0006EB93]
I will not come under your power again!

Id: [0x0006EB94]
No need to worry.

Id: [0x0006EB97]
That's a pity.

Id: [0x0006EB9A]
He wanted to atone for what he'd done. ... He saved my life. And very nearly killed Washington.

Id: [0x0006EB9C]
We do have this.

Id: [0x0006EB9E]
Useless.

Id: [0x0006EBA0]
Don't be foolish!

Id: [0x0006EBA1]
That trinket only opens doors!

Id: [0x0006EBA2]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0006EBA6]
The Animal Spirits know things we do not know. If I journey to them, they may teach me.

Id: [0x0006EBA7]
It is the road to madness!

Id: [0x0006EBB9]
I will hold off any reinforcements! You fight your way back to the main gate.

Id: [0x0006EBDC]
We need help getting through the gate! Quickly!

Id: [0x0006EBE3]
You've saved my men. We must all scatter and disappear into the city. Who are you?

Id: [0x0006EBE8]
Ratohnhak√©:ton! Ratohnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006EBEB]
Thank god you're here! The rebels saw their chance when we drew Washington to the docks. They are attacking the pyramid!

Id: [0x0006EBED]
I will hold them off! Go!

Id: [0x0006EBEF]
You! Can you perform such a feat again? Washington has us completely surrounded.

Id: [0x0006EBF0]
If I can hold off his men, can you get away?

Id: [0x0006EBF2]
Fall back men! Fall back!

Id: [0x0006EC0F]
Come on! We've got a way out.

Id: [0x0006EC11]
Well, sir, I have never seen anything like what you just did. With such prodigious strength, surely you can match Washington. If I could get you into his quarters, do you think you could defeat him?

Id: [0x0006EC12]
Once inside, I will help you, Ratohnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006EC13]
I have no need of help. Alone, I will take Washington's power from him.

Id: [0x0006EC15]
We attacked in desperation. But if I could raise the city! If I could raise up all the people, sir! I could attack with three times the force!

Id: [0x0006EC16]
The people need food. Can you help them?

Id: [0x0006EC17]
Food is controlled by the black market. The black market is controlled by John Fitzwilliams.

Id: [0x0006EC18]
I will track him to his stores of food. You can use them to win support from the citizens.

Id: [0x0006EC19]
Let me find him for you. You can proceed once we've located that blackguard.

Id: [0x0006EC51]
There's Fitzwilliams. You won't find a worse blood-sucker this side of the Atlantic. He sells the food at inflated prices and skims the extra for himself.

Id: [0x0006EC53]
I do not care about him. We only care about getting people something to eat. Eventually, he'll lead me to his hoard.

Id: [0x0006EC54]
Eventually, he'll lead me to his hoard.

Id: [0x0006EC55]
You! ... Yes, you.

Id: [0x0006EC56]
I wasn't doin' nothin'!

Id: [0x0006EC57]
Thomas Jefferson needs someone to get this cart of food to hungry people.

Id: [0x0006EC58]
To sell it?

Id: [0x0006EC59]
Give it.

Id: [0x0006EC5A]
Free food for hungry folks? I'm your man, friend!

Id: [0x0006EC5B]
Over there!

Id: [0x0006EC5D]
Bluecoats!

Id: [0x0006EC5F]
Right there!

Id: [0x0006EC61]
Up there!

Id: [0x0006EC62]
Wasn't sure I was gonna make it out alive, but, god damn! This is the most fun I've had all week!

Id: [0x0006EC63]
Thomas Jefferson, people! This here food is thanks to Mister Thomas Jefferson!

Id: [0x0006EC6A]
Citizens of the United States! I come before you a humbled man.

Id: [0x0006EC79]
As I look out upon this vast land, I see each of you suffering, yes, suffering! And striving for a better life, a better future, a better America. Each one of you sacrificing, slaving for this great country, for freedom. And I humbly say to you, your sacrifices inspire me. They shall not be in vain!

Id: [0x0006EC7B]
I know this life is difficult: the ravages of war; food shortages; crime; the burdens caused by Jefferson's seditious murderers. But we, [abeat]we have a greater purpose that will unite us and lift us above these trifling troubles. For us, the obliteration of these "rebels" will be but a foretaste of the feast to come.

Id: [0x0006EC7D]
Citizens, as I stand here, I feel the four million hearts of our nation beating within my breast. Today I announce the great project of this nation. We are mustering vast armies. We are fashioning powerful armadas. We shall soon march upon our great, dark enemy: England! [a pause]We shall invade her shores and irrigate her fields with blood. English bones shall provide grist for our mills, and her people shall become our slaves. Each of you shall profit from the sweat of their labors! Our nation shall rise to its proper place as the greatest of all: The Most Sovereign Kingdom - The United States of America!

Id: [0x0006EC80]
Down with the King!

Id: [0x0006EC82]
Fight for Jefferson!

Id: [0x0006EC84]
Fight for liberty!

Id: [0x0006EC8E]
Washington is giving a speech. We may be able to get an idea of the size of his forces. Come with me.

Id: [0x0006EC91]
My friend, Paul Revere, disappeared three days ago. This soldier just confirmed the disappearance of his wife and son as well.

Id: [0x0006EC92]
I am sorry.

Id: [0x0006EC93]
Revere was an able and valuable man. He was endeavouring to loosen the Bluecoat grip on the city. Neighborhood by neighborhood, he was winning the people's trust and support.

Id: [0x0006EC94]
I will take up Revere's work to help rally the city. If the citizens fight for us, we will replace Washington with a new leader.

Id: [0x0006ECB4]
The entire city is ready to rise up as one. We  need a signal in order to coordinate the attack.

Id: [0x0006ECB9]
What sort of signal?

Id: [0x0006ECBA]
An explosion. The Bluecoat gunpowder stores in Fort George would do nicely.

Id: [0x0006ECBB]
I will do it.

Id: [0x0006ECBC]
Do not be foolish. Work with Jefferson, you will see the signal within the hour.

Id: [0x0006ECBD]
Food! I can't believe it!

Id: [0x0006ECBE]
I'm going to cry!

Id: [0x0006ECC9]
[Exertion upon creating clones. Big effort,  duration: 1 second.]

Id: [0x0006ECCA]
[Exertion upon creating clones. Big effort,  duration: 1 second.]

Id: [0x0006ECCB]
[Exertion upon releasing a fire-beam. Short and quick effort.]

Id: [0x0006ECCC]
[Exertion upon releasing a fire-beam. Short and quick effort.]

Id: [0x0006ECCE]
[Exertion upon releasing a shockwave. Medium effort, medium duration.]

Id: [0x0006ECCF]
[Exertion upon releasing a shockwave. Medium effort, medium duration.]

Id: [0x0006ECD1]
Leave me be, savage!

Id: [0x0006ECD2]
Someone help me! That's an order!

Id: [0x0006ECD3]
Oh my god!

Id: [0x0006ECD4]
Leave me alone!

Id: [0x0006ECD5]
Out of my way!

Id: [0x0006ECDB]
Serves him right!

Id: [0x0006ECDC]
At last!

Id: [0x0006ECDD]
Bring the bastard down!

Id: [0x0006ECDE]
Good work!

Id: [0x0006ECE0]
No more king!

Id: [0x0006ECE1]
I always hated that thing!

Id: [0x0006ECE2]
Down with the king!

Id: [0x0006ECE3]
Good riddance to that eyesore!

Id: [0x0006ECE8]
Unhand those documents!

Id: [0x0006ECE9]
Those are military secrets!

Id: [0x0006ECEA]
Trying to steal from me?

Id: [0x0006ECEB]
Thief!

Id: [0x0006ECEC]
How on earth?

Id: [0x0006ECED]
I'm hallucinating!

Id: [0x0006ECEE]
What just happened?

Id: [0x0006ECEF]
My goodness!

Id: [0x0006ECF1]
What sort of man would build such a thing?

Id: [0x0006ECF2]
We're not flying the King's colors! They're sure to fire on us!

Id: [0x0006ECF3]
Gather up their colors. We will use them to disguise our ship.

Id: [0x0006ECF4]
You heard him boys! Haul in the flags and we'll hoist 'em up!

Id: [0x0006ECF5]
Deploy full sail, Mr. Faulkner! Then abandon ship! You, too, Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon. I will see you on shore.

Id: [0x0006ECFA]
Quite a sight, isn't it?

Id: [0x0006ECFB]
Aaaaaah!

Id: [0x0006ECFD]
No! No! No, please!

Id: [0x0006ED01]
There was another one. Disperse and find him.

Id: [0x0006ED06]
It will take more than a tomahawk.

Id: [0x0006ED08]
It will take great power.

Id: [0x0006ED0A]
Get ... this ... off me!

Id: [0x0006ED0B]
Yes, your Highness. Yes.

Id: [0x0006ED0C]
Yes, your Highness!

Id: [0x0006ED0D]
And lieutenant!

Id: [0x0006ED0E]
Of course, your Highness. Absolutely!

Id: [0x0006ED12]
You were feverish. What's happened to your eyes?

Id: [0x0006ED14]
Are you certain you're all right?

Id: [0x0006ED15]
We must separate to search out Jefferson and the rebellion.

Id: [0x0006ED17]
Their escape is cut off. They will be cut to ribbons. I must get down there!

Id: [0x0006ED19]
Your Highness. Some of the people are attacking the pyramid.

Id: [0x0006ED1A]
People. Attacking. ... I am the people.

Id: [0x0006ED1B]
Yes, my Liege.

Id: [0x0006ED1C]
I am the people. [a pause]I have given myself to the cause of freedom. Do they not see? I have sacrificed my entire life for them. Defeated the English! Gave them liberty! Me! And yet still they rebel! This is madness.

Id: [0x0006ED1D]
You are our beacon, Your Highness.

Id: [0x0006ED22]
Just a few carrots and he has won their loyalty.

Id: [0x0006ED23]
This country must be led by the people.

Id: [0x0006ED2C]
Our plan is working, my friend. Washington's troops are scattered. The palace is unguarded.

Id: [0x0006ED4A]
It was his size that saved him.

Id: [0x0006ED6B]
This will help you along. The mechanism is rather tricky, but I'm sure you'll be able to unravel it.

Id: [0x0006ED75]
Very well. I will see you once I have succeeded.

Id: [0x0006ED76]
What wickedness occurred here?

Id: [0x0006ED77]
Are you the son of Revere? Perhaps you will lead me to my quarry.

Id: [0x0006ED7A]
Ah! It is the light that springs the traps. Clever.

Id: [0x0006ED7B]
Did you hear that?

Id: [0x0006ED7C]
There is someone in the palace!

Id: [0x0006ED7E]
What happened here?

Id: [0x0006ED7F]
It's like a force of nature came through here.

Id: [0x0006ED80]
Someone came to an unhappy end here.

Id: [0x0006ED81]
A dagger is missing.

Id: [0x0006ED82]
And what are you hiding, Your Majesty?

Id: [0x0006ED83]
Your mother must have helped you through here.

Id: [0x0006ED8D]
Ah. It is you. At last.

Id: [0x0006ED8E]
Commander Washington. If you give up the Apple, I will let you live.

Id: [0x0006ED91]
People want you brought down.

Id: [0x0006ED92]
I am the only King here.

Id: [0x0006ED93]
Jefferson!

Id: [0x0006ED94]
Never touch that!

Id: [0x0006ED96]
Are you all right?

Id: [0x0006ED97]
Keep watch.

Id: [0x0006ED99]
Very well.

Id: [0x0006ED9B]
Well, sir, I have never seen anything like what you did back there. A resourceful man like yourself could easily help the people.

Id: [0x0006ED9C]
My goal is to take Washington down. The rest is none of my concern.

Id: [0x0006ED9D]
We'll never defeat Washington without the people of New York behind us.

Id: [0x0006EDA2]
What is this disturbance?

Id: [0x0006EDA3]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x0006EDA4]
A pleasure, sir. We will meet later and plan our next move.

Id: [0x0006EDA7]
And what do they want?

Id: [0x0006EDA8]
They are starving. We will win their support if we feed them; however, all the food is controlled by John Fitzwilliams. He is the most corrupt official in a city filled with corruption.

Id: [0x0006EDAB]
Bring him to me and I will track him to his stores of food.

Id: [0x0006EDAE]
Get some friends. We'll take as many cartloads as we can.

Id: [0x0006EDB0]
Thomas Jefferson!

Id: [0x0006EDB1]
Possession of the Apple is both a burden and a blessing. Tell me, when you shake the earth, do you feel that you are a slave to the people? ... Or do you wish to be their master?

Id: [0x0006EDB2]
But you didn't answer the question.

Id: [0x0006EDB4]
Give up the Apple?

Id: [0x0006EDB5]
It controls you.

Id: [0x0006EDB6]
Is that what you believe? I believe I control it. Although I never considered the possibility that it could control someone. Perhaps it can.

Id: [0x0006EDB7]
I would use it for the good of everyone.

Id: [0x0006EDB8]
Corrupted? Well, that raises an interesting question: Do you wish me to give up the Apple in order to ‚Ä¶ save my soul? ... Or do you wish the Apple for yourself, so you can control the nation?

Id: [0x0006EDBA]
... The true rulers are the people.

Id: [0x0006EDBB]
Let's not deceive ourselves. It's an absurd thought, but let‚Äôs suppose that I were beholden to this Apple, how would you behave differently?

Id: [0x0006EDBC]
You have been corrupted by the Apple's power.

Id: [0x0006EDC2]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton! I died trying to bring down Washington, but I plead with you: do not pursue the Apple.

Id: [0x0006EDC6]
My son, I am so worried for you. The Sky Journeys have led you astray. Give up your fight for the Apple, please, my son, please!

Id: [0x0006EDD4]
You cowards! Let me go and fight me!

Id: [0x0006EE0A]
Now's your chance! Take the Apple! Take it! TAKE IT!

Id: [0x0006EE2D]
All parts of the city are ready to rise up. At last we will bring down Washington. I trusted him absolutely when we fought the British. Strange that these few years later I would risk everything to bring him down.

Id: [0x0006EE2E]
Has everything been prepared for my signal?

Id: [0x0006EE2F]
I have a man at the military district now. He'll know where the weaknesses are to be found.

Id: [0x0006EE30]
We will signal the beginning of the revolution and destroy their gunpowder all at one time.

Id: [0x0006EE31]
"For treasonous acts against King and country, these men are sentenced to a shameful death by firing squad." Let's get this over with. First one! ... Ready! Aim! Fire!

Id: [0x0006EE34]
Dammit! Somebody built that strong! I coulda sworn that woulda brought it down.

Id: [0x0006EE35]
I have a way to finish our work.

Id: [0x0006EE37]
Don't shoot me! I've done nothing!

Id: [0x0006EE38]
Murderers!

Id: [0x0006EE39]
Reload!

Id: [0x0006EE3C]
Ready! Aim! Fire!

Id: [0x0006EE3D]
God damn you! You couldn't have gotten here a bit sooner?

Id: [0x0006EE3E]
We must hurry to set off the explosion.

Id: [0x0006EE40]
Yes, well there's no easy way to get to the gunpowder. By my way of thinking, the best plan is to set that tower over there on fire then topple it onto the depot.

Id: [0x0006EE41]
I will set the tower on fire. You set up those  powder kegs at its base.

Id: [0x0006EE42]
Spread out! Find the traitors!

Id: [0x0006EE43]
The powder is in place!

Id: [0x0006EE44]
What was that?

Id: [0x0006EE46]
Take the one on the left! I'll get the other one!

Id: [0x0006EE47]
On the right! I'll get the one on the left!

Id: [0x0006EE4A]
Do it quietly!

Id: [0x0006EE4C]
Don't let them see you.

Id: [0x0006EE4E]
Take them by surprise!

Id: [0x0006EE51]
Fire!

Id: [0x0006EE52]
Thank the maker we are not too late.

Id: [0x0006EE53]
Retreating Bluecoats!

Id: [0x0006EE55]
We are almost there.

Id: [0x0006EE59]
This old man's body is still warm. In this weather, it cannot be more than two hours since he died.

Id: [0x0006EE5C]
This fire is still smoking. They were just here.

Id: [0x0006EE5F]
After the fight, the prisoners were marched up the hill.

Id: [0x0006EE62]
You seem to have the nose of the wolves!

Id: [0x0006EE65]
The wolves! Use them!

Id: [0x0006EE68]
Quiet!

Id: [0x0006EE6A]
Close your mouth!

Id: [0x0006EE6C]
Keep quiet!

Id: [0x0006EE6F]
If not for this storm, we would have no need of this Bluecoat.

Id: [0x0006EE71]
Not so rough!

Id: [0x0006EE73]
Hey! I'm helping you!

Id: [0x0006EE75]
I'm going as fast as I can!

Id: [0x0006EE79]
The wolves! Bring them again!

Id: [0x0006EE7C]
I'm trying to get reposted. Maybe Boston or New York.

Id: [0x0006EE7D]
Boston? New York? It's no better there.

Id: [0x0006EE7E]
Sure it is. Big city, things to do.

Id: [0x0006EE7F]
Nothin' to do there but chase beggars these days.

Id: [0x0006EE82]
This is the worst duty I ever had.

Id: [0x0006EE83]
It's not so bad. The bear's in a cage.

Id: [0x0006EE84]
Cage don't look to strong to me. That bear'd as soon eat us as look at us.

Id: [0x0006EE85]
He looks friendly enough.

Id: [0x0006EE86]
Friendly until he's hungry.

Id: [0x0006EE87]
Even so. Our duty ain't as bad as Harry's.

Id: [0x0006EE88]
Why? What's Harry got to do?

Id: [0x0006EE89]
Clean the cage.

Id: [0x0006EE8B]
The bear! Get the bear! General Arnold will have our heads!

Id: [0x0006EE92]
[heavy sigh]

Id: [0x0006EE96]
Where we headed, anyway?

Id: [0x0006EE9A]
Commander Washington.

Id: [0x0006EE9B]
I thought I was alone.

Id: [0x0006EE9D]
I'm sorry to interrupt.

Id: [0x0006EE9E]
It's quite all right.

Id: [0x0006EE9F]
Things appear to be at a stalemate.

Id: [0x0006EEA0]
I'm afraid so.

Id: [0x0006EEA1]
Might I suggest, Commander, that a republic cannot survive in a world with so many contending powers.

Id: [0x0006EEA2]
I beg your pardon?

Id: [0x0006EEA7]
Elected bodies, to be sure. The war was fought for this. For this nation to prosper, for this nation to thrive, the weakness of a republic must be balanced by a powerful man at its center.

Id: [0x0006EEAC]
A powerful man, Commander, who, if... if I may be so bold, would be elevated in the eyes of the world if he were given the title of King.

Id: [0x0006EEB1]
Sir. [a pause]I believe I can answer you in complete candor. Your proposal raises the greatest mischief that can befall my country!

Id: [0x0006EEB5]
You could not have found a person to whom your schemes are more disagreeable. Let me conjure you then, if you have any regard for your country, concern for yourself or posterity, or respect for me ...

Id: [0x0006EEBA]
... to banish these thoughts from your mind, never communicate, as from yourself, or any one else, a sentiment of the like nature.

Id: [0x0006EEC0]
We are done here.

Id: [0x0006EEC1]
You want to go back?

Id: [0x0006EEC2]
Yes. Back. Take us back.

Id: [0x0006EEC8]
O-ho! Enjoy your nap?[laugh]

Id: [0x0006EECA]
It‚Äôs a shame about ol' Arnold, but, ha-ha! I had to laugh at your expression when I hit you! Great big eyes and then, out! [laugh]Out like a light![laugh]

Id: [0x0006EECC]
God damn you, Putnam!

Id: [0x0006EECD]
You woke up just in time. We‚Äôll be arriving in Boston, the town that will soon be mine! Washington will love it: "Look, sir! The man who defied you! The man you shot point blank! I give him to you as a little gift! [laugh]He wears a wolf hat, too!"

Id: [0x0006EECE]
You have gone mad! All of you!

Id: [0x0006EECF]
With that, he'll kick out Ben Franklin for sure and Boston will be mine. It's in the bag - just like your head![laugh]

Id: [0x0006EED1]
Rumors of fighting in the Pyramid District are outlandish lies and anyone spreading such rumors are liable to disciplinary action!

Id: [0x0006EED2]
Unruly vagabonds are being suppressed in the Pyramid District. Citizens are advised to stay away.

Id: [0x0006EED3]
A group of traitors has fired on the pyramid! Citizens are advised that the King is safe and unharmed! He is our beacon!

Id: [0x0006EED4]
Reports of gunfire in the vicinity of the pyramid are without foundation! There is no dissent in New York City!

Id: [0x0006EED5]
The Pyramid District has been declared closed! Citizens found in the Pyramid District will be shot. The King is our beacon.

Id: [0x0006EED6]
Citizens are forbidden from entering the Pyramid District as of this moment. Citizens are advised to make no attempt to determine what's happening near the pyramid.

Id: [0x0006EED7]
Citizens are urged to continue about their business in an orderly manner. Reports of a military engagement at the pyramid are exaggerated.

Id: [0x0006EED8]
Activities in the Pyramid District are not meant for public view. Avoid the Pyramid District or face severe punishment. The King watches over us!

Id: [0x0006EEDE]
This way, Ratohnhake:ton.

Id: [0x0006EEDF]
This way! Come!

Id: [0x0006EEE0]
Follow me!

Id: [0x0006EEE1]
Stay with me!

Id: [0x0006EEE5]
You will die!

Id: [0x0006EEE6]
I will make you pay.

Id: [0x0006EEE7]
Time for your just reward.

Id: [0x0006EEE8]
You will not take me alive.

Id: [0x0006EEE9]
I need help over here!

Id: [0x0006EEEA]
Ratohnhake:ton! Help!

Id: [0x0006EEEB]
There are too many! Help me!

Id: [0x0006EEEC]
I need your help!

Id: [0x0006EEED]
I will fight to the end.

Id: [0x0006EEEE]
I cannot last much longer.

Id: [0x0006EEEF]
I do not have much left.

Id: [0x0006EEF0]
I must keep going.

Id: [0x0006EEF6]
I think you'll be rather pleased.

Id: [0x0006EEF7]
How very thoughtful, Putnam. Do you know any of this, Mister Franklin?

It is this way.

Id: [0x0006EFBC]
Are you talking about Commander Washington?  Why did that woman call him King?

Id: [0x0006EFBE]
This is madness! I cannot understand what is going on!

Id: [0x0006EFBF]
Scepter? Mother, this all becomes more and more difficult to understand.

[grunt]

If Putnam doesn't get this message, I will miss my chance to trap Franklin. I must return it to the messenger's satchel.

Id: [0x0006F01F]
We're locked in!

It wasn't me!

Id: [0x0006F022]
Christ! The King'll have our heads for this.

But he watches over us!

Shut it, would ya!

Thank you for getting me out of there.

Id: [0x0006F029]
Get what you need, then we'll go.

Id: [0x0006F02E]
Look at this rubbish we brought back. Useless!

Id: [0x0006F02F]
It's spoils of war, now.

The owner put up a hell of a fight.

Id: [0x0006F04E]
Your mother cannot help you now.

Id: [0x0006F050]
You have no business in this place.

Id: [0x0006F052]
You failed to save your village. You failed to save your mother.

Id: [0x0006F05F]
Makes me nervous.

Id: [0x0006F060]
It's our chance to distinguish ourselves in his eyes!

Id: [0x0006F062]
General Putnam's on another tear.

Id: [0x0006F063]
Best to lay low.

Id: [0x0006F064]
Had a man whipped for not shaving properly.

Id: [0x0006F065]
That fellow got off easy

Id: [0x0006F067]
I'm in a pickle.

Id: [0x0006F068]
How's that?

Id: [0x0006F069]
Commander Franklin wants curfew imposed at ten o'clock, but then General Putnam told me to start at nine.

Id: [0x0006F06A]
You're mincemeat, my friend.

Id: [0x0006F06B]
Franklin is harsh, but Putnam is crazy. I better start at nine.

Id: [0x0006F06C]
Makes me very nervous.

Id: [0x0006F06E]
Anyone want to play? I'll take on all comers!

Id: [0x0006F06F]
Drink! Drink, my friend! Enjoy it! It could be your last.

Id: [0x0006F070]
Everybody's a hilarious comedian in this miserable town.

That's from Sam's uniform. Dried blood.

Id: [0x0006F074]
Whew! That was close!

Id: [0x0006F076]
Thanks for taking care of that.

Id: [0x0006F078]
Oh, dear. Trouble ahead.

Id: [0x0006F07A]
I'm going to need some help here.

Id: [0x0006F07C]
I'd appreciate it, if you'd stay in sight.

Id: [0x0006F07F]
You there! Soldier! Stop!

Id: [0x0006F080]
What business have you in this district?

Id: [0x0006F081]
Why, I, um.

Id: [0x0006F082]
What corps are you with?

Id: [0x0006F083]
I'm, uh ... I'm assigned directly to General Putnam! Personal detail.

Id: [0x0006F084]
Likely story. Let's see your papers, Corporal Personal Detail.

Id: [0x0006F085]
I've just been assigned. My papers are still in process.

Id: [0x0006F086]
All right, that's it! Come on! To the hoosegow!

Id: [0x0006F08C]
Look! Here is one of us!

Id: [0x0006F08D]
Come along, we're headed to the tavern. You can buy us a mug of flip!

Id: [0x0006F097]
Hold on there, corporal!

Id: [0x0006F098]
They tossed us out of the last one. Not a very friendly bunch.

Id: [0x0006F099]
I should've knocked that fella's hat off! I shoulda!

Id: [0x0006F09A]
There, there. Don't make a fuss. But come along, you! You look like you could do with a drink, frankly.

Id: [0x0006F09B]
Wassa matter? We're not good enough for ya!?

Id: [0x0006F09C]
Yes, sir.

Id: [0x0006F09D]
That uniform doesn't really fit you, does it?

Id: [0x0006F09E]
I've uh, I've gained a few pounds is all.

Id: [0x0006F09F]
Have you, now?

Id: [0x0006F0A0]
Too many popovers, you see. With butter. And ale.

Id: [0x0006F0A1]
That's not your uniform at all, is it?

Id: [0x0006F0B0]
Mother, you failed to stop Washington, but maybe I can follow you to him.

Id: [0x0006F0E0]
What target was up here?

Id: [0x0006F0E1]
Why is this loose?

Id: [0x0006F0E2]
These doors were forced open.

Id: [0x0006F0EE]
After all my mother endured; after all that I have done; the king is not here.

Id: [0x0006F0EF]
Mother. It is time I finished what you began.

Id: [0x0006F0F1]
There are teeth marks on this.

Id: [0x0006F0F2]
Dried blood. Too much for a human.

Id: [0x0006F0F3]
Someone broke through here.

Id: [0x0006F0F4]
Shoot anything that comes through there!

Id: [0x0006F0F5]
You! Patrol the area. Make sure no one has already gotten in.

Id: [0x0006F0F6]
This might be it for me.

Id: [0x0006F0F7]
I don't have much left.

Id: [0x0006F0F8]
I fear this is the last.

Id: [0x0006F0F9]
I've given my all.

Id: [0x0006F0FA]
Over here! Help!

Id: [0x0006F0FB]
I need assistance!

Id: [0x0006F0FC]
Help me!

Id: [0x0006F0FD]
Over here! Quickly!

Id: [0x0006F0FE]
I'll make you pay!

Id: [0x0006F0FF]
Let's have at it!

Id: [0x0006F100]
A penny saved is a penny earned!

Id: [0x0006F101]
Come on, you!

Id: [0x0006F102]
Come along.

Id: [0x0006F103]
Keep up with me, please!

Id: [0x0006F104]
We're in a hurry, remember.

Id: [0x0006F105]
Along here.

Id: [0x0006F107]
[laughing]

Id: [0x0006F161]
The likes of him don't belong in here.

Id: [0x0006F163]
Look at that outfit.

Id: [0x0006F165]
Does this establishment serve such people?

Id: [0x0006F167]
I prefer to drink without fellas like him around.

Id: [0x0006F169]
That's my condition.

Id: [0x0006F16A]
Very well, but let's make it quick.

Id: [0x0006F16C]
What do you mean, got suckered?

Id: [0x0006F16E]
What are you talking about?

Id: [0x0006F170]
What!?

Id: [0x0006F172]
Do you know this for a fact?

Id: [0x0006F175]
Samuel Adams, hit the ground like a sack of flour. Fought back like a sack, too, frankly. Pleasure see him sent off to Hades.

Id: [0x0006F177]
Make a move, would ya?

Id: [0x0006F179]
Come on, I thought you were in a hurry.

Id: [0x0006F17B]
Could ya move sometime this century?

Id: [0x0006F17C]
Good riddance to those louts! They never paid anyway.

Id: [0x0006F17E]
I have to be certain. Someone must have seen this.

Id: [0x0006F17F]
I must carefully steal the message from his pocket.

Id: [0x0006F182]
Why did you disobey me, my son?!

Id: [0x0006F184]
A journey to the Sky World is far too dangerous.

Id: [0x0006F186]
What good is victory, if you lose yourself?

Id: [0x0006F188]
I wanted to protect you.

Id: [0x0006F18A]
The Clan Mother is wise, but she can be mistaken.

Id: [0x0006F18C]
Never again, Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006F18E]
Escape, Ratonhnhak√©:ton! Escape from the Sky World!

Id: [0x0006F190]
You must never come back here, my son!

Id: [0x0006F192]
My words were wise, my son! You should not have come here!

Id: [0x0006F195]
Snipers!

Id: [0x0006F197]
They're shooting at Faulkner!

Id: [0x0006F199]
You need to stop them!

Id: [0x0006F19B]
You must stop the shooters!

Id: [0x0006F19D]
They're shooting at the crew!

Id: [0x0006F19F]
The sailors are being shot!

Id: [0x0006F1A1]
Those are official documents!

Id: [0x0006F1A2]
What are you doing?

Id: [0x0006F1A3]
Those belong to me!

Id: [0x0006F1A4]
Trying to steal my documents, eh?

Id: [0x0006F1A6]
He's broken their cannons!

Id: [0x0006F1A7]
That'll show 'em!

Id: [0x0006F1A8]
Down with Washington's artillery!

Id: [0x0006F1A9]
Bravo!

Id: [0x0006F1AA]
No more cannons!

Id: [0x0006F1AB]
Down with Washington!

Id: [0x0006F1AC]
They won't shoot at us with those anymore!

Id: [0x0006F1AD]
Nice work!

Id: [0x0006F1AE]
My god!

Id: [0x0006F1AF]
A royal soldier, murdered!

Id: [0x0006F1B0]
He's hanged one of us!

Id: [0x0006F1B1]
But he's one of Washington's troops!

Id: [0x0006F1B2]
Who would do such a thing?

Id: [0x0006F1B3]
Washington won't permit such crimes!

Id: [0x0006F1B4]
You can't do that to the king's men!

Id: [0x0006F1B5]
That's a capital crime!

Id: [0x0006F1B6]
That's right! String up the Bluecoats!

Id: [0x0006F1B7]
He got what he deserved!

Id: [0x0006F1B8]
Look at the Bluecoat hanging around!

Id: [0x0006F1B9]
He deserves it!

Id: [0x0006F1BA]
String him up!

Id: [0x0006F1BB]
Hang 'em high!

Id: [0x0006F1BE]
Hold him off!

Id: [0x0006F1BF]
I'll go for help!

Id: [0x0006F1C0]
Cover my escape!

Id: [0x0006F1C1]
Get him!

Id: [0x0006F1C2]
Chase that bastard down!

Id: [0x0006F1C3]
Run him into the ground!

Id: [0x0006F1C4]
Get that lobcock!

Id: [0x0006F1C5]
Catch that Bluecoat bastard!

Id: [0x0006F1C6]
Look at the coward run!

Id: [0x0006F1C7]
Watch out for Bluecoats.

Id: [0x0006F1C8]
Be careful. I saw Bluecoats up ahead.

Id: [0x0006F1C9]
Good luck.

Id: [0x0006F1CA]
Bluecoats are everywhere.

Id: [0x0006F1CB]
Keep to the shadows as best you can.

Id: [0x0006F1CC]
Watch for soldiers.

Id: [0x0006F1CD]
Looks clear up there.

Id: [0x0006F1CE]
I think it's okay ahead.

Id: [0x0006F1CF]
I don't see any Bluecoats ahead.

Id: [0x0006F1D0]
We're good through here.

Id: [0x0006F1D1]
Bluecoats ahead.

Id: [0x0006F1D2]
Watch out.

Id: [0x0006F1D3]
Careful. Soldiers.

Id: [0x0006F1D4]
We better be careful through here.

Id: [0x0006F1D5]
Go ahead, loot that bastard!

Id: [0x0006F1D6]
Take whatever you want.

Id: [0x0006F1D7]
Empty his pockets! He deserves it.

Id: [0x0006F1D8]
Bluecoats deserve to be looted.

Id: [0x0006F1D9]
Yeah! Get his valuables!

Id: [0x0006F1DA]
Go through the bastard's pockets!

Id: [0x0006F1DB]
[cries of pain]

Id: [0x0006F1E0]
Help! We're stuck in here!

Id: [0x0006F1E2]
Damn injuns tricked us!

Id: [0x0006F1E4]
Somebody?

Id: [0x0006F1E6]
Hey, come let us out!

Id: [0x0006F1E8]
Watch for those sneaky savages!

Id: [0x0006F1EA]
Is anybody there?

Id: [0x0006F1EC]
Don't let them break down the door!

Id: [0x0006F1EE]
You must stop them!

Id: [0x0006F1F1]
My stars! These animals do your bidding? Astonishing.

Id: [0x0006F1F7]
[effort]

Id: [0x0006F1F8]
Stay clear of their vessels, lad. We won't fool 'em if they get close.

Id: [0x0006F1F9]
Watch for mines!

Id: [0x0006F1FA]
Christ! They're on top of us! Better shoot first. Catch 'em with their knickers down!

Id: [0x0006F1FB]
I forgot how a good sea battle could get my blood flowing!  Sail around attacking ships. That's the life!

Id: [0x0006F1FC]
[laugh]I know that feeling. It seems to run in my family.

Id: [0x0006F1FD]
Your father was a seafarer, then?

Id: [0x0006F1FE]
My grandfather, Edward. He sailed with a rough crew, or so I am told.

Id: [0x0006F200]
Slow down, lad!  There's mines about!

Id: [0x0006F202]
Don't shoot the mines. That'd give us away for sure!

Id: [0x0006F204]
There they are. We've fooled 'em with our flag!

Id: [0x0006F206]
Shoot the mines now, lad! Blow those boats to kingdom come!

Id: [0x0006F20C]
For the king?

Id: [0x0006F20D]
For himself. But that is a long tale for another day, Mister Faulkner.

Id: [0x0006F20F]
[breathing]

Id: [0x0006F216]
Why has Washington sent his men to raid the Frontier?

Id: [0x0006F217]
Washington?

Id: [0x0006F218]
To find somebody - a native woman who tried to take it from him.

Id: [0x0006F219]
He will not find me by you.

Id: [0x0006F21A]
Fire!

Id: [0x0006F21B]
Get as far away from town as possible! Find shelter in the forest!

Id: [0x0006F21C]
Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006F21D]
Oi√°:ner  sent us to collect boughs of the Great Willow.

Id: [0x0006F21E]
To make the tea?

Id: [0x0006F21F]
Has she lost her senses?

Id: [0x0006F220]
The tea's pitfalls overshadow its power. You must not do it.

Id: [0x0006F221]
You'll not succeed here!

Id: [0x0006F222]
You!? You survived? How astonishing.

Id: [0x0006F223]
This time, I'll make certain of your death.

Id: [0x0006F224]
MOTHER!

Id: [0x0006F225]
Washington!

Id: [0x0006F226]
It falls to you to make good on your mother's mistake.

Id: [0x0006F227]
Journey to the Great Willow, climb her, retrieve the virgin boughs in her canopy.

Id: [0x0006F228]
Drink their essence and gain the power to fight, to bring down this mad King George.

Id: [0x0006F229]
Oi√°:ner !

Id: [0x0006F22A]
Kill Arnold and stop the destruction here.

Id: [0x0006F22B]
You must succeed.

Id: [0x0006F22C]
You escaped me once, but today you die.

Id: [0x0006F22D]
Find Benjamin Franklin in Boston.

Id: [0x0006F22E]
He can help you.

Id: [0x0006F22F]
You have to free him.

Id: [0x0006F230]
Free him from where?

Id: [0x0006F231]
Got you.

Id: [0x0006F233]
Ah!

Id: [0x0006F234]
[effort]

Id: [0x0006F235]

The citizens of America praise the enlightened leadership of King Washington. His has brought this nation to great heights! He will take us to greater heights still!

Id: [0x0006F240]
The great bounty we enjoy in this country is due to the beneficent policies of our king! Let us all remember how he labors to improve our lives and how he watches over us at all times.

Id: [0x0006F242]
Help complete the Pyramid! Donate your silver candlesticks and other items of value! The splendor of the new palace will reflect glory on us all! Anyone refusing to donate will be flogged.

Id: [0x0006F244]
Today is a day of giving thanks to our king and protector! All rejoice! Whatever our humble circumstances, we share in the glory of our king!

Id: [0x0006F246]
King Washington will bring us glory! King Washington will bring us riches! Dedicate yourself to the king and all will be well! He is our beacon!

Id: [0x0006F249]
Tell the truth, dammit!

Id: [0x0006F24B]
Washington is profiting from our misery! Unite against the king! Bring him down! Bring down the king!

Id: [0x0006F24D]
It's all lies! The king won't protect you! He's using you! Rise up against him!

Id: [0x0006F24F]
Now's your chance! We must all come together against Washington! We must unite for freedom!

Id: [0x0006F251]
Washington is crushing us! We must work together for freedom! Join the rebellion!

Id: [0x0006F253]
Don't believe what I just said! It was propaganda! He's not our beacon at all! Take up arms and join the fight against Washington!

Id: [0x0006F255]
Cut off their reinforcements! Destroy the gates!

Id: [0x0006F257]
They just keep coming! Bring down those gates!

Id: [0x0006F259]
Destroy the gates to cut them off!

Id: [0x0006F25C]
We're trapped! You must bring down the front gate!

Id: [0x0006F25E]
Destroy that gate! It's our only escape!

Id: [0x0006F261]
Hey, pretty missy. I'll give you some food, if you're real nice to me, if you know what I'm sayin'?

Id: [0x0006F262]
All your carrots are rotten. Especially your little one.

Id: [0x0006F264]
I've no money, sir, but my family's desperate for food.

Id: [0x0006F265]
Shove off! If you were a real man, you'd go rob somebody to pay me!

Id: [0x0006F267]
Fitzwilliams cornered the market on foodstuffs, by god.

Id: [0x0006F268]
How does he get away with it? Right under Washington's nose!

Id: [0x0006F269]
Oh, don't you worry. The king gets a cut of every carrot and turnip all right.

Id: [0x0006F26A]
You think Washington's a part of this?

Id: [0x0006F26B]
What are you? An innocent babe?

Id: [0x0006F26D]
Help! I need you over here!

Id: [0x0006F26F]
I'm in trouble over here! Come back!

Id: [0x0006F270]
Can't go through there! Blow up those kegs!

Id: [0x0006F272]
Explosives in the way! Clear 'em out!

Id: [0x0006F274]
Help! A madman is after me!

Id: [0x0006F276]
I'm being chased by the man-wolf!

Id: [0x0006F278]
A savage is chasing me down!

Id: [0x0006F27A]
Help!

Id: [0x0006F27C]
He's too fast!

Id: [0x0006F27E]
Stop the wolf-savage behind me!

Id: [0x0006F281]
Thanks for helping me through there. I'll do my part.

Id: [0x0006F283]
I appreciate the help. I'm with you, my friend.

Id: [0x0006F286]
What's going on in there?

Id: [0x0006F288]
Fire! Is there anybody in there?

Id: [0x0006F28B]
The tower's afire!

Id: [0x0006F28D]
Fire! Fire in the tower!

Id: [0x0006F28E]
For liberty!

Id: [0x0006F28F]
Fight, damn you!

Id: [0x0006F290]
A taste of steel!

Id: [0x0006F291]
Come on and fight!

Id: [0x0006F292]
I don't have long.

Id: [0x0006F293]
The tree of liberty must be refreshed with the blood of patriots.

Id: [0x0006F294]
Carry on with the struggle.

Id: [0x0006F296]
I need help over here!

Id: [0x0006F297]
We're faltering!

Id: [0x0006F298]
Rally to me!

Id: [0x0006F299]
Over here! Help needed!

Id: [0x0006F29E]
Bluecoats firing from above. Take them out!

Id: [0x0006F2A0]
Stop those men up there!

Id: [0x0006F2A2]
They're firing down on us! Take those men out!

Id: [0x0006F2A6]
I warned against this.

Id: [0x0006F2A8]
Can you not see that you are lost?!

Id: [0x0006F2AA]
My son! My son! Why have you done this again?

Id: [0x0006F2AC]
I weep for you, my son.

Id: [0x0006F2AE]
Why have you returned to this place?

Id: [0x0006F2B0]
This is worse than before, Ratonhnhak√©:ton!

Id: [0x0006F2B2]
You should not have come back here.

Id: [0x0006F2B4]
You have defied me! You ignore my last wish!

Id: [0x0006F2B6]
I cannot forgive you, my son.

Id: [0x0006F2B8]
Will you ever find yourself again?

Id: [0x0006F2C7]
Previously on <br>The Tyranny of King Washington

Id: [0x0006F2CC]
Spread out! Find the traitors!

Id: [0x0006F2CE]
The powder is in place!

Id: [0x0006F2D6]
Dammit! Somebody built that strong! I coulda sworn that woulda brought it down.

Id: [0x0006F2D7]
I have a way to finish our work.

Id: [0x0006F2D8]
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely.

Id: [0x0006F2D9]
Lord Acton, 19th century

Id: [0x0006F2E3]
I've got a present for you, Your Highness.

Id: [0x0006F2E4]
It's the one you blasted point blank in the village, sire.

Id: [0x0006F2E5]
He survived?

Id: [0x0006F2E6]
Remarkable.

Id: [0x0006F2E7]
Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon! Alive? ... Oh, my friend, I cannot believe you're here!

Id: [0x0006F2E8]
They said you have been killed. Along with your mother.

Id: [0x0006F2E9]
The Clan Mother brought me to health.

Id: [0x0006F2EA]
I was unable to protect my mother.

Id: [0x0006F2EB]
I was unable to save the village.

Id: [0x0006F2EC]
That is how you can move as you do.

Id: [0x0006F2ED]
Every journey holds the chance of meeting a new Animal Spirit.

Id: [0x0006F2EE]
Every journey holds the chance of losing yourself. I understand the risks.

Id: [0x0006F2EF]
I will take the journey.

Id: [0x0006F2F0]
Maybe I don't have to free Franklin from a prison. I have to free him from Washington's power.

Id: [0x0006F2F1]
I found an ally, Ratonhnhak√©:ton.

Id: [0x0006F2F2]
Samuel Adams!

Id: [0x0006F2F3]
You are the famous man with the wolf hood.

Id: [0x0006F2F4]
Aaaaah!

Id: [0x0006F2F5]
Hold still.

Id: [0x0006F2F6]
My God. What have we done?

Id: [0x0006F2F7]
Putnam is gone and the Captain at Boston Neck is secretly sympathetic to us.

Id: [0x0006F2F8]
I created a very special means of protection for Washington's palace.

Id: [0x0006F2F9]
An attack there would be completely unexpected.

Id: [0x0006F2FA]
You can get me past these protections?

Id: [0x0006F2FB]
This is a fool's errand, my friend, but I hope to see you in New York.

Id: [0x0006F2FC]
By heavens, what happened?

Id: [0x0006F2FD]
Boston Neck was a trap set by Putnam.

Id: [0x0006F2FE]
And Adams? ... Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon?

Id: [0x0006F2FF]
Everyone killed.

Id: [0x0006F300]
Your men stole my ship, you shite!

Id: [0x0006F301]
Easy, Mr. Faulkner. Mr. Franklin is on the side of the rebels, now.

Id: [0x0006F302]
We need your help.

Id: [0x0006F303]
I'll need you to untie the Aquila so it's all set to go. Meantime, I can scare you up a small crew.

Id: [0x0006F304]
Then we'll rush the guards and set sail.

Id: [0x0006F305]
Swim! I'll hold them off until you're ready to sail!

Id: [0x0006F306]
Savage! Over here!

Id: [0x0006F307]
Call back your men and give yourself up.

Id: [0x0006F308]
I knew your only chance was to leave from the docks. He kept turning the wheel.

Id: [0x0006F309]
Kanen‚Äôt√≥:kon. I do not care.

Id: [0x0006F30A]
Land ho!

Id: [0x0006F30B]
Look at that.

Id: [0x0006F31F]
This time, I'll make certain of your death.

Id: [0x0006F329]
You cannot match my power. I am freedom itself!

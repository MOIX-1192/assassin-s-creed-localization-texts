The Royal Exchange and its use as a centre for trade was inspired by the Brouse in Antwerp, which had made Belgium the financial capital of Europe. Ironically enough, Antwerp would be raided by the Spanish ten years later, losing the nation's wealth and allowing England to take over as the new financial power. Thanks again, Spain!<LF><LF>The main investor in the first Royal Exchange was a wealthy merchant named Sir Thomas Gresham. When the Exchange was built in 1570, it featured a grasshopper—the insect on Gresham's coat of arms—on the weathervane and a statue of Gresham in the open courtyard. The statue was the only thing in the Royal Exchange to survive the Great Fire of 1666.

<LF>hristopher Wren was hired to redesign London—a task about as big as being made Editor of the Internet—and he envisioned the Royal Exchange as the center of the city, with all of London sprawling out from it. The second Royal Exchange was open to the public from 1669 to 1838, when it was again consumed by fire. As flames licked the bell tower, the last song the bells chimed was the Scottish tune "There's Nae Luck Aboot the Hoose."

<LF>'m sure the fact they kept playing loud Scottish folk songs was in no way connected to the place being set on fire.<LF><LF>The third and current Royal Exchange was built on the foundations of its predecessors and opened by Queen Victoria on October 28, 1844. Gresham's grasshopper returned to its place of glory, where it has remained since.

Id: [0x000952F1]
Purse Snatcher

Id: [0x000952F2]
Harvey Hughes grew up in poverty, denied the luxurious life he felt he deserved. In his pursuit of a fortune, he quickly eschewed hard work and found that money came in abundance if he applied another method: theft. Today, Harvey gladly shares his wealth and lends money easily, promising excellent rates—and charging huge interest. His schemes have forced many desperate victims into the poorhouse.

Known for destroying confessionals and throwing explosives at tabernacles, David always vanishes before anyone can catch him.

Id: [0x0009BA29]
The Brotherhood is struggling. Having waged war with the Templars in various colonies, little is to be done. The leaders are afraid to travel into the heart of darkness, into London, to face Grandmaster Starrick. Instead, they lurk around the edges. Enter Jacob and Evie Frye, as they prepare to take down two targets outside Croydon, a suburb of London.

Id: [0x0009BA2A]
Jacob invaded Ferris Ironworks, taking note of the squalid conditions. Improvising the mission, he successfully assassinated Rupert Ferris, who taunted him as he died for not having the bravery to visit London. Jacob escaped on a train that derailed, but jumped off to safety.

Id: [0x0009BA2B]
With their targets out of the way, brother and sister met to regroup. Jacob’s target planted a seed: the desire to take on Starrick’s London network and destroy it. Evie’s target revealed a cryptic tale of a Piece of Eden. Both Fryes snuck onto a train bound for London, Evie after the Piece of Eden and a liberated London, Jacob after Templars and glory.

Id: [0x0009BA2C]
Once in London, the Fryes began to disagree. Jacob started a gang called the Rooks, seizing the train of a gang boss named Kaylock to use as a hideout. He mocked Evie’s quest for the Piece of Eden, while Evie dismissed his campaign to take on the Templars as reckless and sloppy.

Id: [0x0009BA2D]
Templars were supplying Starrick's Soothing Syrup to the poor to keep them docile. Jacob partnered with Charles Darwin to find and take out the source: Dr. Elliotson. Meanwhile, working with Henry Green, Evie followed clues to find the Piece of Eden - in a race against Templar Lucy Thorne.

Id: [0x0009BA2E]
Jacob searched for Starrick’s Templar specialist in transportation and worked with rival Pearl Attaway to take him out. But he was misled: Attaway was Starrick’s cousin, and Jacob's true target.  Evie's search for the Shroud of Eden led to a hidden vault and mysterious key which was stolen by Lucy Thorne.

Id: [0x0009BA2F]
Jacob discovered that Starrick's banker, Philip Twopenny, was planning to use his position as Governor to rob the Bank of England. Jacob infiltrated the vault and assassinated Twopenny. Evie headed to the Tower of London, hoping to find the Shroud. After a final confrontation with Lucy Thorne and recovered the key, but the Shroud is still missing.

Id: [0x0009BA30]
Jacob visited parliament to uncover Starrick's plant in politics, assassinating the Earl of Cardigan. Evie and Henry attempted to recover plans showing the location of the Shroud. Henry was captured, and Evie chose saving him over finishing the mission. Blaming herself for the failure, Evie cut her ties with Henry.

Id: [0x0009BA31]
Jacob's encounter with the leader of the Blighters was a surprise. Maxwell Roth was a charming anarchist, whose views spoke to Jacob’s own. The two began to sabotage Starrick, but Jacob's moral objections ended the friendship. Devastated and betrayed, Roth hosted a deadly stage show at the Alhambra Music Hall. Jacob saved the guests and assassinated Roth.

Id: [0x0009BA32]
An argument between Jacob and Evie had them ready to part ways when Henry arrived with the news that Starrick would attack Buckingham Palace. Faced with this threat, the three assassins put aside their differences for one last mission. Together they defeated Starrick, and agreed to continue protecting London together.

Named after the patron saint of children, St. Pancras station was built by the Midland Railway Company on a disreputable slum—not to be confused with those reputable slums you hear so much about. Landlords were happy to sell their property for a pretty penny, and inhabitants of the neighborhood were driven out of their homes without compensation. Building the station required moving a church and excavating its graveyard, disturbing many people from their eternal rest. Lovely.
<LF>The Midland Railway Company held a contest in 1865, as St. Pancras was being built, to find the best design for a hotel the company intended to attach to the station. The winner was the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, despite—or perhaps because—his submission was greater and more expensive than the specifications the MRC called for.

<LF>he first train to leave St. Pancras in 1868 was bound for Manchester and did not stop until it reached Leicester, 97 miles away. At the time, it was the longest continual train run in the world. I bet it never stopped there again.

Since the thirteenth century, Lambeth Palace has been the London residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, leader of the Church of England. The site's proximity to Westminster made it an appropriate location to house someone with the political and religious influence the Archbishop of Canterbury held at that time. The first Archbishop to take up residency in Lambeth Palace was Stephen Langton, a key player in the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. That's key as in, a major figure. Not a keyboardist at the afterparty. <LF><LF>The palace endured damage and distress over the course of England's many wars, especially the English Civil War, which was never properly repaired until the nineteenth century. Before its renovations, the architect Edward Blore called the Palace "miserably deficient." Now there’s a review I'd like to read.
<LF>Notable buildings that make up Lambeth Palace include Morton Tower, which serves as the palace entrance as well as the living quarters of the palace's guard; the Palace Library, which has been open to the public since 1610 and features records dating back to the tenth century; and the Archbishop's private chapel.

So, the end of the seventeenth century saw the nations of Europe pitted against one another in the Nine Years' War. It was an expensive war for England, and after suffering a significant naval defeat at the Battle of Beachy Head, King William III couldn’t afford to rebuild their navy. Then came a Scottish merchant named William Paterson who, with a handful of his colleagues, raised £1.2 million pounds from rich and poor alike in 11 days to finance the government—this was the Bank of England, and those who donated were its first shareholders. The Bank proved to be the most financially sound investment one could make—if an early shareholder continually reinvested their dividends from an initial £100 investment, their shares would be worth over £40 million by the time the bank became nationalized in 1945. Of course, £100 in 1694 was the equivalent of roughly £15 thousand today, so good luck finding that behind the sofa.

The Ba<LF>k of England was originally based in Mercer's Chapel, but was given its own home on Threadneedle Street in the 1730s. The bank's nickname, "The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street," comes from a notable patron named Sarah Whitehead. The sister of a former employee who was found guilty of forgery and executed in 1811, Sarah was so traumatized by the death of her brother that she visited the bank every day for the next 25 years, asking to see her brother.

Westminster Abbey is the monarchy's personal church and has been the coronation site of England's kings and queens since William the Conqueror took the throne on Christmas Day, 1066. Best Christmas gift ever.<LF><LF>When Edward the Confessor successfully drove the Danes from England in the eleventh century, he rebuilt a Saxon church in the Romanesque style to show his gratitude to God and the Pope. King Henry III took the throne hundreds of years later, and he in turn rebuilt the church in a Gothic style as a tribute to Edward the Confessor. To pay for the project, Henry had to divert funds from the kingdom, which people at the time didn't appreciate very much. The result was Westminster Abbey as we know it. The church has remained largely unchanged since the thirteenth century. <LF><LF>Despite its name, Westminster Abbey is technically neither an abbey nor a cathedral but a Royal Peculiar, meaning it is under the jurisdiction of the monarchy and not the Church of England.<LF><LF>We've had quite a few Royal Peculiars in this country over the years…

The Royal Hospital of St. Bartholomew is the oldest hospital in all of London. It was built in the year 1123 by a travelling entertainer turned Anglo-Roman monk named Rahere. The story goes that Rahere fell ill while on a pilgrimage to Rome and vowed to found a hospital if he survived and returned home safely. You know, that old story. The number of hospitals built that way is astounding.<LF><LF>The most notorious physician to work at St. Bartholomew was Dr. Rodrigo Lopez, appointed to the hospital in 1562. He would go on to become Queen Elizabeth’s chief physician. He was arrested in 1594 for attempting to poison the Queen, and was hanged, drawn, and quartered in June of that year.  The scandal, combined with Lopez's Judaism, reignited a trend of Jewish villains in theatre, including a revival of Christopher Marlowe's The Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta and most notably, William Shakespeare's writing of The Merchant of Venice.
<LF>When the cholera epidemic hit London in 1831, St. Bartholomew's Hospital refused to admit cholera patients—you know you're in bad shape when even the hospital says "no, thank you!" Instead, cholera patients were kept in a nearby house which was demolished following the outbreak.
<LF> medical school was built as an extension of the hospital a few years later. The facilities were state-of-the-art, and featured a library, medical and chemical theatres, an anatomy museum, and dissection rooms.

For much of England's history, the Lord Mayor of London conducted municipal business out of their home or guild hall. Only in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1666 did the idea come about to build a residence for all Lord Mayors. Not all of them at once, mind. <LF><LF>A house full of Lord Mayors. That's a reality show waiting to happen.<LF><LF>The architect George Dance the Elder, then the Clerk of the City's Work, was hired to design and build what would be called the Mansion House. Construction began in 1739 and the House wasn't completed until 1758. The first Lord Mayor to move into the Mansion House was Sir Crispin Gascoigne in 1752, while the House was still under construction.<LF><LF>Today, the Mansion House serves as the Lord Mayor’s residence and office as well as a site for business meetings and city functions, including the annual "Mansion House Speech," where the Chancellor of the Exchequer speaks on the state of the British economy.

Formerly the site of the monarchy’s stables and carriage house, Trafalgar Square was designed by the architect John Nash as an open space for the public. The square was improved upon over the course of the nineteenth century, with fountains and statues giving the originally modest square some embellishment.
<LF>The whole of Trafalgar Square is a monument to one of the most storied and legendary conflicts in British history, the Battle of Trafalgar, where the British Navy, led by Admiral Horatio Nelson, defended the nation from Napoleon Bonaparte’s naval advances in 1805. We beat the French. Admiral Nelson was mortally wounded during the conflict and died three hours later. But that’s fine, because he won. He beat the French. We beat the French.

<LF>efeat in battle was not enough permanently drive Napoleon away from England, however; instead he turned his focus to weaker enemy nations, and his victories over them allowed his empire to grow. <LF><LF>Still beat 'em. Granted, I had a baguette yesterday, so maybe it's time to move on.

The earliest church built on this site in the name of Saint Paul dates back to 604 CE. It was made of wood and burned down 71 years later. Subsequent churches were likewise wooden and likewise consumed by fire, until the chaplain to William the Conqueror built the cathedral out of stone in 1087. This building would survive for 600 years. <LF><LF>It's almost like stone isn't flammable. Bloke was a bloody genius.<LF><LF>St. Paul's Cathedral was originally a place of Catholic worship, and a center for public activity. Trading took place in the cathedral, as well as games of sport, despite objections from those in charge of the cathedral. When Henry VIII severed ties with the Catholic Church, St. Paul's became a Protestant cathedral, and although it went back to Catholic worship under Mary, Queen of Scots, St. Paul's became Protestant once and for all under Queen Elizabeth in 1559. <LF><LF>Efforts to restore St. Paul's were delayed time and time again by such events as the English Civil War and the Great Fire of 1666, which claimed the cathedral as one of its many casualties. Legendary architect Christopher Wren, who was only in his thirties, was hired to redesign St. Paul's before it was destroyed by the Great Fire, and he engineered the design and construction of a new, revitalized cathedral. <LF><LF>By the nineteenth century, St. Paul's had once again lost its lustre. Queen Victoria remarked that the cathedral was "dreary, dingy, and undevotional." Funds were raised to improve the cathedral by such philanthropists as Maria Hackett and William Weldon Champneys. But not Crawford Starrick. Interesting.

Id: [0x0009BC0E]
The esteemed Professor Byng was the victim of a diabolical plot confected by his colleague and erstwhile acolyte, Professor Silas. Using a powerful spider venom, Silas put his mentor into a deep coma. He went so far as to attempt to eat Byng`s brains in an effort to ingest his knowledge! All this was inspired by the very African tribe Professor Byng had himself discovered. No doubt Silas’s mind was unbalanced, as he believed he would surpass all anthropologists by absorbing his mentor’s cerebrum. Rest in peace, Professor Byng; The Royal Anthropological Society mourns your passing.

Charing Cross Station

Id: [0x0009BC10]
Eleanor's Cross, also known as the "chere reine," is the apocryphal origin of the name Charing Cross—the name derives from the small village of Charing that stood in this spot hundreds of years earlier, separating the City of London from Westminster. Since the eighteenth century, this junction has been considered the exact centre of London.
<LF>In 1554, Sir Thomas Wyatt led a rebellion against Queen Mary after she announced her impending marriage to Philip of Spain. Wyatt's men met Mary's troops in Charing village, and the ensuing battle resulted in Wyatt surrendering.<LF><LF>Charing Cross station was designed by Sir John Hawksaw and built in 1864 by the South Eastern Railway, one of many train stations to spring up in the core of the city. Despite being just two miles away from London Bridge, the train line took four years to build. A total of 17 bridges and 190 arches stand between Charing Cross and London Bridge. <LF><LF>17 bridges?! That's a bridge too far.

Cannon Street Station

Id: [0x0009BC13]
The name Cannon Street has nothing to do with the weapon, but is in fact an English corruption of the street’s original name, Candlewick Street, or Candelewrithstret as it was known in the twelfth century. The street earned its name from the number of candlemakers and drapers who lived and worked there.
<LF>Cannon Street station was built by the South Eastern Railway following an Act of Parliament in 1861 allowing its construction—it opened to the public September 1st, 1866. The station's hotel was built the following year, and was designed by E.M. Barry, the son of J.W. Barry, the architect behind the Houses of Parliament.
<LF>The presence of the train station, and its proximity to the Thames, bolstered Cannon Street as a centre of trade. As the ninteenth century drew to a close, the area became populated with warehouses and industrial buildings.

London Bridge Station

Id: [0x0009BC15]
London Bridge station is the oldest railway terminus is London and has a history of corporate competition, partnership, and dissolution. <LF><LF>The original station was opened in 1836 by the London and Greenwich Railway (LGR). It was simple in design and not very large, but the LGR used its prime location to lease its line and station to its competitors, who sought to access London through the station. By 1840, four different train companies were paying the LGR to use its line. One competitor, the London and Croydon Railway (LCR) built its own station adjacent to that of the LGR and eventually merged with the competing railways using LGR's station. The amalgamated companies, which would later call itself the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, completed their coup by taking over LGR's station in 1844, demolishing the station, and rebuilding it all within the same year. <LF><LF>You're welcome, incredibly specific nineteenth century regional railway company fact fans.

Victoria Station

Id: [0x0009BC17]
Here’s some train history for you adrenaline junkies: 
<LF>As railway stations were built around the city, Westminster became a desired location for the competing railways to control. In the end, Victoria station was built in 1862 and made up of two units run by two different companies: the western unit was owned and run by the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, while the eastern unit was operated by the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. Each had its own entrance and was inaccessible from the other side. <LF><LF>In Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, Jack claims that he was found as a baby in a handbag in Victoria station, insisting that he was found on the Brighton side, implying a social superiority associated with the Brighton station. This perception of the two stations is supported by the fact that the Brighton Station featured an elaborate 300-room hotel called The Grosvenor while the Chatham station had no adornments or additional buildings attached to it. <LF><LF>Details like that are very important to babies.

Buckingham Palace

Id: [0x0009BC19]
When Queen Victoria first moved into Buckingham Palace in 1837, mere weeks after her ascension to the throne, she remarked, "I delight in Buckingham." That was before she realized the palace was cold, musty, poorly ventilated, and far too small for her needs.<LF><LF>The original building was a private residence built by the Duke of Buckingham. King George III purchased the appropriately-named Buckingham House in 1761 as a gift for his wife, Queen Charlotte. George IV took the throne in 1820, and he aimed to upgrade Buckingham House to a palace. The grandiose king hired architect John Nash, and Nash doubled the size of the original Buckingham House, adding a new suite of rooms, demolishing the north and south wings and rebuilding them larger than before, and installing the large Marble Arch in the courtyard. After all, what's a courtyard without a marble arch? Don't even invite me round if you lack one. Nash got so carried away with building the new palace that his budget ballooned to about half a million pounds. He was fired in 1829, and George IV died the following year, before the palace was completed.<LF><LF>George IV's successor, his brother William IV, oversaw the completion of Buckingham Palace but never lived there. It was Queen Victoria who would be the first monarch to take up residency at Buckingham Palace, almost twenty years after its construction began.

Houses of Parliament

Id: [0x0009BC1B]
Also known as the Palace of Westminster, the Houses of Parliament were built and remodelled around one of the first royal residences. The Great Hall inside Parliament is the last remnant of the palace built by William II at the end of the eleventh century.<LF><LF>The Old Palace remained a royal residence for just over 400 years, until Henry VIII moved to Whitehall Palace in 1530. The Old Palace became the permanent location for the country’s two houses of parliament, the House of Commons and the House of Lords. To call Henry VIII's relationship with the Catholic Church "turbulent" would be an understatement. It's like saying that in the 1940s, Britain's relationship with Germany was "a little fraught." This conflict with the church put the King's lawyers hard at work, and they situated themselves at the Old Palace, making the building the home of the Courts of Law as well.
<LF>Two of the most notable people to be tried in the Palace of Westminster are Guy Fawkes, the Catholic extremist who attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1606, and King Charles I, who was tried and executed for treason at the height of the English Civil War. Prime Minister Spencer Percival was assassinated in the lobby of the House of Commons in 1812.

Temple Church

Id: [0x0009BC1D]
The Temple Church was an early place of worship for our favorite people, the Knights Templar. The Round Nave, the trademark of the church, was built in 1185, and was consecrated by Heraclius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem.<LF><LF>The church was originally part of a larger monastic complex that included residences, military training grounds, and places for recreation. The Knights Templar used the church for initiation ceremonies, which would be held in a crypt beneath the nave. No doubt these ceremonies were creepy as hell. The church also served as a bank for the nobility, and this, combined with an influx of gifts from the royal family, made the Knights Templar very wealthy in the tenth and eleventh centuries.<LF><LF>The first known refurbishment of the church took place in the seventeenth century, by English architect Christopher Wren. Wren installed an organ and altar screen in the church, but more notably, he whitewashed the church’s paintings and applied plaster to the marble columns in an attempt to fit aesthetic tastes of the time.
<LF>Wren's work was largely undone in 1841, when the church was restored by architects Sydney Smirke and Decimus Burton. Don't they sound like a music hall double act? "Please welcome—the comedy songs of Smirke 'n' Burton!!!” Smirke and Burton's work gave the church a Victorian Gothic look that not only fit the tastes of the time but fit closely with the church’s original design. It was Smirke’s intention to return the church to its "original, ideal [[Templar]] form."

Waterloo Station

Id: [0x0009BC1F]
When the London and South-Western Railway first built Waterloo station in 1848, it was only meant to be a stopover between Southampton and the City of London. That didn't stop Waterloo from becoming a high-traffic station, though, and as demand grew, additional platforms were built around the original building, which became known as the "Central station." Each new platform was built with its own entrance and booking office, and was either mislabelled or not labelled at all. Confusion grew further in 1869 when another train station named Waterloo Junction was built across the street.<LF><LF>Waterloo Station accomodated passengers both living and dead. In response to London's crowded cemeteries, Parliament established the London Necropolis and Mausoleum Company in 1852 to create a new burial ground outside the city and ship the newly deceased from inside the city. The former task was achieved by building a 500-acre cemetery in Surrey—the largest in the world at the time—and the latter by establishing the "Necropolis Railway," a private rail line that moved all those corpses directly from Waterloo station to Surrey. Waterloo was chosen as a departure point because its location by the Thames allowed bodies to be delivered to the station from all over London.

St. Margaret's, Westminster

Id: [0x0009BC21]
St. Margaret's church is on the grounds of the Houses of Parliament. It's one of the oldest churches in England, having been built by Edward the Confessor to accommodate the growing populace. The House of Commons and the Speaker have attended mass at St. Margaret's since 1614, and sermons were traditionally given by the Speaker's chaplain.<LF><LF>In 1643, early in the English Civil War, parliamentarian Edmund Waller plotted to return King Charles to London, an act of betrayal to the Long Parliament. Waller's Plot, as it was known—what an original name—was discovered by Long Parliament leader John Pym during a sermon at St. Margaret's. Pym immediately ordered the arrest of Waller and his co-conspirators from the church, and poor old Edmund was ultimately banished for his crimes.

<LF>'m told the churchyard was a popular burial site for many centuries, but is a burial site ever really popular? I mean, they're not as good as nightclubs. Anyway, by the mid-nineteenth century, the yard became so overcrowded that doctors claimed the foul air would negatively affect proceedings in Parliament. The parish obtained a new burial yard on Fulham Road and relieved St. Margaret's yard of its many occupants.<LF><LF>Notable people to be married in St. Margaret's include the poets John Milton and Thomas Campbell, and diarist Samuel Pepys. Not to each other. To other people. I must make that clear.

St. Mary le Strand

Id: [0x0009BC23]
In 1710, Queen Anne urged Parliament to pass an act allowing for the construction of fifty new churches in London. The act was passed, but building fifty churches is easier said than done; only twelve of what were called Queen Anne’s churches were ever built. The first Queen Anne church was St. Mary le Strand, on the former site of the largest maypole in London. A rise in Puritanism in the 1660s meant that many of the city's maypoles were torn down by religious extremists due to their "heathen" origins; this maypole fell over from a high wind in 1672.
<LF>In its original plans, St. Mary's featured a 250-foot column to honour Queen Anne. A statue of the Queen was to sit atop the column, but I think the actual Queen should have sat on top of the 250-foot column. That I'd go and see. No matter, though; the design was approved and materials were acquired, but the plan was quietly cancelled following Anne's death in August of 1714.

10 Downing Street

Id: [0x0009BC25]
Despite being known around the world as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Great Britain, it wasn't until 1908 that Prime Ministers were legally required to live at 10 Downing Street.<LF><LF>The street was named after George Downing, a man who served as Oliver Cromwell's Chief of Intelligence during the English Civil War. When the monarchy reclaimed power at the end of the war, Downing used his powers of persuasion to avoid execution and pledge his services to King Charles II. The first residence built on the site of 10 Downing Street was the home of Sir Thomas Knyvet, which was given to him by Queen Elizabeth in 1581. Knyvet's greatest accomplishment was arresting Guy Fawkes and foiling the terrorist attack on Westminster Palace. I guess that's worth a house.<LF><LF>Now, the first Prime Minister to reside at 10 Downing Street was Sir Robert Walpole. King George II offered Walpole the house as a gift in 1732, but Walpole only accepted the offer on the condition that 10 Downing Street become the official residence of the Prime Minister.<LF><LF>Because nearly all Prime Ministers preferred to live in their own homes, 10 Downing Street fell into disrepair over time. By the time Benjamin Disraeli was elected Prime Minister in 1868, the home was, in his words, "dingy and decaying." Disraeli convinced Parliament to pay to renovate the residence, although Disraeli had to pay out of pocket to refurbish the private rooms.

Belgrave Square

Id: [0x0009BC27]
Before 1820, Belgrave Square was a rural farming area between the city of London and the nearby village of Knightsbridge. Considered a swamp and a haven for dog-fighters, the land was developed by the landowners in collaboration with the high and mighty Grosvenor family to create an expansion of London. The project was completed in 1825. <LF><LF>The corners of this ten-acre square correspond with the four points of the compass. The largely uniform houses that line the square have been occupied by many notable English people, including ambassadors, politicians, and perhaps most famously, Queen Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent. I bet bin day was fun. "Hello Duchess! My, that's a lot of bottles for recycling!"

Green Park

Id: [0x0009BC29]
In 1660, King Charles II desired to be able to walk from Hyde Park to St. James's Park without having to take his feet off royal soil. He was really down to earth like that. He commissioned the creation of what he called Upper St. James's Park to bridge the unroyal gap between the aforementioned parks.<LF><LF>The park was officially renamed Green Park in 1746—an explanation for the name change comes from an probably untrue story: when Queen Catherine discovered that King Charles had picked flowers from the park to give to another woman, she ordered the flower beds in the park to be removed in a fit of jealousy, making the park entirely "green." To this day there are no flower beds in the park. 
<LF>Personally, I'm more concerned that he was picking flowers out of a park to give some woman. What's the matter, mate? Can't find a florist?<LF><LF>In June 1840, Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate Queen Victoria as her carriage passed just outside Green Park. He fired twice on the carriage, missed, and was subdued. This was the first of eight attempts on the Queen's life. She was pregnant at the time.

Hyde Park

Id: [0x0009BC2B]
The 360 acres of land that now make up Hyde Park once belonged to the monks of Westminster Abbey. King Henry VIII took the land from the monks in 1536, not for religious or political reasons, but so that he could expand the borders of his hunting grounds. The park remained the monarch's private hunting ground until Charles I opened it to the public in 1637.<LF><LF>Many of the park's current features can be attributed to Queen Caroline, wife of George II. Not a popular name for Queens, Caroline. Same reason there have been so few King Steves. Anyway, Caroline oversaw the landscaping of Kensington Gardens, as well as the artificial lake known as the Serpentine. Artificial lakes of the time were built in straight lines—Caroline and her contractors, on the other hand, noticed this look was boring and designed the Serpentine to appear natural. This set a trend that would be replicated in parks and gardens throughout Britain.
<LF>In 1866, a human rights group called the Reform League marched on Hyde Park to voice their support for working class suffrage. They were met with violent opposition from the London police force and a conflict erupted that lasted three days. This kind of violence resulted in the park's Speaker's Corner, which was established in 1872 as a public space where citizens could demonstrate peacefully. Although if you've heard half the fellas that use Speaker's Corner these days, it's enough to bring you to violence.

St. James's Park

Id: [0x0009BC2D]
Before there was a park and a palace, there was a hospital. Dating as far back as 1267, St. James's Hospital specialized in treating female lepers. The patients worked on the marshy land around the hospital as part of their treatment, primarily raising hogs for the hospital to sell—not often a hospital is funded by pork. King Henry VIII acquired the land in 1532 to use as a hunting ground, making St. James's Park the oldest of London's Royal Parks.
<LF>While Henry VIII used the park to hunt, Queen Elizabeth hosted lavish parties in the park. King James invested in the park, adding gardens and a menagerie of exotic animals. As the English Civil War came to a close, King Charles made his final procession from St. James to Whitehall Palace, where his execution awaited him.<LF><LF>Charles II was the last monarch to take care of St. James's Park for some time. When he died, the park gained a reputation for criminal activity and prostitution. John Wilmot, the libertine Earl of Rochester, wrote a poem called A Ramble in St. James's Park that describes the unsavory happenings in the park in graphic detail. I've read it. Definitely NSFW. And it's rare you can say that about poetry.

Leicester Square and the adjoining Leicester House were once the property of Robert Sidney, the Earl of Leicester, who purchased the land from the government in the 1630s. The public didn't take kindly to once-public land being walled off and used exclusively by the rich, so King Charles II responded to the outcry by making the field public once again. <LF><LF>Many duels were held in Leicester Square in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. One of these, which started as a drunken pub quarrel between British officers and ended with a fatality, was recounted in an installment of Charles Dickens's All The Year Round magazine. Even these days, if you want to see a drunken pub quarrel, I can heartily recommend Leicester Square.<LF><LF>As the land was developed and made into a public square, it became a popular location for entertainment. An opera house was built near Leicester Square in the late eighteenth century, as well as a museum of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon, which featured many specimens collected by Captain James Cook, and Wyld's Globe, a large spherical attraction that allowed patrons to see a map of the Earth from the inside.

Lincoln's Inn Fields is the largest public square in London, reportedly designed to be the same size as the base of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. It was commissioned by King James in the 1630s as an improvement to the city, but according to such literary figures as John Gay, writer of The Beggar's Opera, the square quickly gained a reputation for attracting beggars and vagrants. Literature of the time described a particular group of homeless who flocked to the square known as "rufflers." These beggars posed as wounded soldiers to elicit sympathy from the public. One infamous beggar known as the Scarecrow went so far as to "disable" his right leg in order to earn money. Commitment to the role! Marvellous.<LF><LF>An act of Parliament closed the square in 1735, and it remained closed to the public until it was acquired by the London County Council in 1895.

Agnes MacBean

Date of Birth: 5 January 1815.<LF><LF>Daughter to a homemaker and an ironworker, Agnes MacBean was born in Garnkirk, Scotland. The eldest of six, Agnes quickly grew into her robust, outspoken character, bossing her younger siblings about and giving her parents a run for their money.<LF><LF>In 1831, Scotland began construction of its very own railway system: the Garnkirk and Glasgow lines. Her father, Mungo MacBean, being an expert in the field, was sent to work in the rail yards. Aspiring to be more like her father, Agnes learned what she could about trains and how they worked and hoped to one day follow in Mungo’s footsteps. 
<LF>Three years later, Agnes had her chance. Mungo’s sudden ill health coincided with the merging of the Scottish and English rail lines (though it would take an imaginative conspiracy theorist to link the two), and Agnes, for the benefit of her family, took her father’s place inside his locomotive. More unusually, however, and to speed the transition, she took on his identity, as well.

<LF>wo years later, following an incident, Agnes was discovered to be a woman and, in punishment, transferred to Starrick Industries. There, she was placed under the employment of the cruel Whitechapel Gang Leader Rexford Kaylock, and her train in his illegal service.<LF><LF>In 1868, her train, dubbed “Bertha,” was hijacked by Assassin twins Jacob and Evie Frye.

Alexander Graham Bell

Id: [0x0009BD59]
Date of Birth: 3 March 1847.<LF><LF>From the day he was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, sound and communication were very important in Alexander Graham Bell’s life. His father was a highly respected speech therapist and elocutionist, and at the age of 12, young Aleck’s mother lost her hearing. His father developed a phonetic alphabet aimed at teaching the deaf to speak while Aleck himself learned to communicate with his mother by speaking into the side of her head so she could feel the vibrations of his voice. Rebecca does something similar whenever I try to block her out.

<LF>he other thing that defined Aleck’s life was his natural inventiveness. By the time he was a teenager, Bell had already created a system for dehusking wheat. But then I suppose we all do crazy things when we're teenagers. Plus, with the help of his brothers Melville and Edward, he developed an automaton that could speak by blowing air from a bellows while manipulating the machine's “lips.” The Bell boys were able to get the machine to articulate crude words like “mama.” And you thought ventriloquism was tough to sit through.

Bel<LF>’s genius was such that he was hired as a “pupil-teacher” of elocution and music at Weston House in Scotland. His family moved to London at around the same time—Aleck would join them in 1867 after Edward died of tuberculosis. While in London, Aleck attended the University of London and worked for his father, providing speech therapy and teaching his father’s phonetic alphabet to the deaf. And, it seems, crafting nifty gadgets for a pair of Assassins.

His<LF>ory has managed to document that creepy bloody automaton, but there’s not a word about his interactions with Jacob and Evie Frye. As it should be.
<LF>Anyway, Aleck and his parents moved to Canada in 1870 after Melville, like his brother, succumbed to tuberculosis. Aleck himself was showing symptoms of the disease, but thankfully for all of humankind, he recovered and would go on to invent, among other things, the dumb version of the smartphone.<LF><LF>Bell passed away the 2nd of August, 1922, at the age of 75. When his body was interred two days later, phone traffic was shut down for a minute in his honour. If people weren’t crying over Bell’s death, shutting down the phone lines would do the trick.

Arthur Conan Doyle

Id: [0x0009BD76]
Date of Birth: 22 May 1859.<LF><LF>Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, young Arthur left at the tender age of nine for Hodder Place, Stonyhurst preparatory school in England. Unrecorded in all but the most painstaking biographies is his short sojourn in London, where he first came to appreciate the deductive arts in complicity with a mysterious pair of twins. He continued his education at Stonyhurst, later to return to Scotland where he earned a medical degree at the University of Edinburgh.<LF><LF>Doyle served as ship's doctor on expeditions to both the Arctic Circle and Africa before settling in Plymouth, then Portsmouth, England, giving up his medical career to struggle as a writer (and play goalkeeper for an amateur football club). He eventually moved to Upper Wimpole Street, London, where he began to compose a series of mystery novels featuring a tweedy detective.<LF><LF>Doyle became increasingly interested in spiritualism (possibly due to the sensational murder of the psychic Thaddeus the Amazing during Doyle's stay in London), and, following the death of his first wife joined the famous Ghost Club. He also believed in fairies.

Benjamin Disraeli

Id: [0x0009BD78]
Date of Birth: 21 December 1804.<LF><LF>A novelist, a dandy, and a man practiced in law, Benjamin Disraeli, albeit surprisingly, came to be one of Europe’s leading statesmen.
<LF>The first and thus far only Jewish-born Prime Minister of England, Disraeli became famous for shaping the modern Conservative Party and for his feud with William Ewart Gladstone.<LF><LF>Disraeli was born in London in 1804, to Isaac and Maria D’Israeli. When Benjamin was twelve years of age, Isaac converted his family to the Anglican Church following a dispute with the local synagogue. Later, Benjamin would further anglicize his name from D’Israeli to Disraeli when he went to work for Maples’s law firm in 1821, though his exact motivations are unknown. Possibly he got fed up of spelling it out for people.

B<LF>fore entering the House of Commons, Disraeli dipped his toe in the waters of both literature and the stock exchange. He was fortunate that it was only his toe, too, because when he found himself both a critical failure and massively in debt he suffered a nervous breakdown. Still, despite it all, he finally found his way into parliament in 1837, gaining a seat in the Conservative Party. It was during this period that he forged his lifelong rivalry with Gladstone.<LF><LF>In 1839, Disraeli married Mary Anne Lewis for what was thought by many to be financial reasons, but the couple at least grew to love each other and remained bound until her death in 1872. “Dizzy married me for money,” Mary once stated. “But, if he had the chance again, he would marry me for love.”

Di<LF>raeli became Prime Minister for the first time in 1868, but failed to win that year’s election. He led the opposition to majority once again in 1874, becoming Prime Minister for a second time with a reign lasting six years.
<LF>Suffering from gout and severe asthma, Disraeli died in 1881. Queen Victoria, with whom he had made good friends over the course of his political tenure, was distraught by his passing, but, due to the royal protocol, was forbidden from attending his funeral.

Catherine Gladstone

Id: [0x0009BD7A]
Date of Birth: 6 January 1812.<LF><LF>Standing beside her husband, Catherine’s Gladstone’s life was not quite as public. Her father having died when she was only three, Catherine and her siblings (Mary and Stephen) were raised by their mother. Catherine and Mary grew to be extremely close, getting married on the same day at the same venue, and Catherine acting like a mother to her children when Mary passed away in 1857.

<LF>atherine met William Ewart Gladstone through her brother in 1834 and the two “Great People” (as Mary had called the couple) married in 1839. The couple were together for fifty-nine years before Gladstone’s death in 1898, and had eight children together.

T<LF>ough notoriously untidy, Catherine was a brilliant woman who devoted her life to improving the lives of others.

Charles Darwin

Id: [0x0009BD7C]
Date of Birth: 12 February 1809.<LF><LF>Charles Robert Darwin is best known for his contributions to evolutionary theory. <LF><LF>Darwin neglected an education in medicine at the University in Edinburgh in order to pursue his interests in nature. This annoyed Darwin’s father, who sent him to Christ’s College at the University of Cambridge, with the goal of turning him into an Anglican parson. By all accounts, he was not very interested in studying, preferring instead to spend his time riding, shooting, and collecting beetles. That's the 'hobbies' section of a dating profile I'd avoid. His time at Christ’s College only intensified his obsessive passion for the natural sciences. 

D<LF>rwin’s detailed journal of his voyage aboard HMS Beagle made him famous in scientific circles. Upon his return, his father helped Darwin invest so that he could function as a self-funded gentleman scientist. I'd love to have that on my business cards. Darwin’s many successes came at a cost, though, as the man was plagued by various illnesses caused by overwork.

<LF>arwin’s On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. (By the 2000s, in—ahem—certain countries I absolutely refuse to name, much of the general public appears to have taken a big step backwards! I'm talking about America.)

D<LF>rwin was an international celebrity, who is remembered for providing a unified theory of the life sciences that explains the wide diversity of life on this planet. He was honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey.

Charles Dickens

Id: [0x0009BD7E]
Date of Birth: 7 February 1812.<LF><LF>A celebrity during his lifetime, Charles John Huffman Dickens remains one of the largest sources of information regarding nineteenth-century London. Known for being both a literary titan and an activist, Dickens’s work showcased the life and personalities of London’s working class people.

<LF>If you ask around in London pubs that still exist today, most report that he was a regular. Imagine being a regular at EVERY. SINGLE. PUB. That takes dedication. –RC)
<LF>My favorite contemporary criticism of Dickens would have to be: “Mister Dickens, as in revenge for his own queer name, does bestow still queerer ones upon his fictitious creations.” 

<LF>ickens was born in Portsmouth, the second of eight children. He was said to have had an idyllic childhood up until the summer of 1824, when his father, John Dickens, was arrested for debt and thrown into Marshalsea Debtor’s Prison—with his family in town. To help pay off his father’s debt, Charles was forced to leave school and begin work at Warren’s Blacking Warehouse, a place that was notorious for its poor treatment of children. Not a crèche to be seen. Yet even after his father’s debt was cleared, young Charles’s mother suggested he continue to work: “I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget,” he said, “that my mother was warm for my being sent back.”

Once free<LF>of the warehouse, and after attending school, Dickens got a job at the law office of Ellis and Blackmore. Living in the city, he attended the theatre religiously and, inspired by the stories spun on the stage, began his writing career.<LF><LF>Dickens of course went on to be world-renowned for works, including Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol¸ and Great Expectations, and his success as a writer continued throughout his life, with even Queen Victoria calling herself a fan. Perhaps less well-known, however, is Dickens’s powerful interest in the supernatural, which eventually saw him become part of Cambridge’s Ghost Club, an organization of paranormal investigation and research

<LF>ne of the biggest controversies surrounding his life was his extramarital relationship with Ellen Ternan, a young theatre actress with whom he remained until his death. Ternan and Dickens kept their affair a secret, destroying their entire history of correspondence in a bonfire nine years into their relationship. In June 1865, Dickens was involved in the Staplehurst rail crash, but despite quite heroically helping to rescue other victims, he refused to speak at the accident’s inquest to avoid having to disclose that he had been travelling with Ternan and her mother.
<LF>Between 1868 and 1869, Dickens gave a series of farewell readings in England, Scotland, and Ireland. During this time, he also began work on what would be his final and only unfinished novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood. <LF><LF>In June 1870, after a full day’s writing, Dickens suffered a stroke died the next day (coincidentally, the fifth anniversary of the Staplehurst crash). He was buried in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey.

Winston Churchill

Id: [0x0009BD80]
Date of Birth: 30 November 1874.<LF><LF>Born in 1874 into an influential aristocratic family, Winston believed he was destined for great things from the start, and was obsessed with eclipsing his ancestors. All very healthy. Among them, his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the first Duke of Marlborough, and won a series of battles against the French in the War of Spanish Succession. Which makes him rather likeable, in my eyes.<LF><LF>In 1895, Winston Churchill joined the British army, serving in the Indian northwest frontier and the Sudan. Four years later he left to work as a war correspondent, and was taken prisoner by the Boers while reporting on the war in South Africa. He escaped by travelling almost 300 miles into Mozambique.<LF><LF>It was after this that he entered politics, quickly developing a reputation for self-aggrandisement, particularly after his highly publicised presence in a police siege on the streets of London, where he allegedly gave direction on the ground. In 1911, he became First Lord of the Admiralty and oversaw the modernisation of the British Navy. It was in this position that he was first involved in the First World War, obsessing over how to counter the German submarine threat.<LF><LF>Forced to resign over the failed Battle of Gallipoli, Churchill stepped outside of politics to lead a brigade on the Western Front, experiencing the war first hand before returning to Britain, where he would become Minister of Munitions in 1917. His supervision of the production and delivery of tanks, planes and ammo to the front was credited as a significant contributor to Germany’s defeat.
<LF>It was his role during the Second World War for which he is most remembered, though. As prime minister during the conflict, he was celebrated for his tactical genius, leadership, and steadfast refusal to allow the Nazis to succeed. Later, he would continue to shape world events, pushing for social reform in Britain and winning the Nobel Prize for literature. He died of a stroke in 1965... arguably having achieved precisely what he set out to do in his youth.

Clara O'Dea

Id: [0x0009BD82]
Date of Birth: 24 February 1856.<LF><LF>Born in 1856, Clara was the only child of the less-fortunate O'Dea family. Like many Irish women, Clara's mother was an indentured servant to an upper-class household in the Strand. <LF><LF>Sneaking into the family's private lessons, Clara picked up as much as she could, devouring the education her parents could never afford to give her. Unfortunately, after being wrongly accused of theft, Clara's mother was dismissed from her job and was forced to find other means of survival. <LF><LF>By the time she turned ten, Clara had become the sole breadwinner in her household. Her father having left the family a year prior, and her mother bedridden and sick with grief, Clara took to the streets to support what little family she had left. The orphaned children with whom she found kinship gave her a sense of belonging that she had never experienced before.<LF><LF>Courageous and charismatic, Clara, now orphaned herself, has grown up to be a remarkable young business woman and today helps provide for children in need.

Crawford Starrick

Id: [0x0009BD84]
Date of Birth: 18 August 1827.<LF><LF>Crawford Starrick was born in the West End of London, the younger son of Robert Starrick, a wealthy but un-landed businessman who had famously tripled the value of his family estate as a young man by investing in the heady early days of Railway Mania.<LF><LF>There's probably a magazine called Railway Mania, isn't there?<LF><LF>The Starrick boys were bred for competition. Throughout their early childhood they were neck and neck in academics and sports, almost as often as they were at each other’s necks. “Boys, through and through,” their mother observed proudly, never suspecting anything darker beneath the surface. When Crawford was twelve, boarding school provided an opportunity. He at last had room to grow. 

H<LF> was ostracised by his House, sarcastically dubbed “Lord Starrick” for the airs he put on. In his private notebooks, he began to see humanity as divided into two strata: those who served and those who ruled. Naturally, he fell into the latter category. Recognising that he would earn no friends at school, he settled instead for lackeys. He sharpened his charm to a fine point, hid his disdain behind smiles and helpful words, until he could bend teachers and peers to his will. “A natural gift for leadership,” teachers would remark. “Shows great improvement. Young Crawford has come into his own.” The feeling of power and control was addictive.

Upon<LF>graduation, he modeled himself as a railroad baron, and through smart purchasing and the strange disappearance of the competition, he rose to the top. With his larger fortune he expanded into many different industries, also broadening his reach across London. He fell in love once, and only once, to a businesswoman as ruthless as he, but she refused to marry him.<LF><LF>Crazy women, eh?!

David Brewster

Id: [0x0009BD86]
Date of Birth: 11 December 1781.<LF><LF>Born the third of six children—the tastiest bit of a large-family sandwich—to God-fearing Scottish Presbyterians—who make really bland sandwiches—David Brewster was destined to orbit greatness like the space station orbits the Earth… or Europe orbits Britain. At the age of twelve, he was sent to the University of Edinburgh to join the clergy, which is exactly what we do with twelve-year-olds today, post them to Scotland so they’ll stop annoying us. 

But <LF>is congregation would have to wait. Brewster became fascinated by optics and was persuaded to continue studying the diffraction of light, touching on such exciting topics as reflection and refraction and are you still awake? Brewster quickly moved on to the laws of metallic absorption… oh, you’re nodding off. Well, long story short, he invented the kaleidoscope. THAT’S fun, isn’t it? Unfortunately, he didn’t patent it quickly enough, and although it sold like gangbusters, he made very little money. 

Aft<LF>r he partnered with like-minded clergymen to start a scientific magazine The Edinburgh Journal of Science and was knighted by the Queen, he came out as a very vocal opponent of evolutionary theory, which just goes to show you that the clergyman who invented the kaleidoscope can’t always get it right. 
<LF>Like an old man still paying for dial-up Internet access even though he’s connected to a cable modem, Sir David seems to have been built for a different era, that of Galileo. Although maybe not even… after all, he did invent a telescope that looks precisely nowhere.

John Elliotson

Id: [0x0009BD8A]
Date of Birth: 29 October 1791.<LF><LF>The son of a chemist and apothecary, John Elliotson attended Jesus College at Cambridge, which might explain his panache as a prophet. Unfortunately, he chose mesmerism to preach. Forget the Virgin Mary, he cavorted around with mesmerised twin sisters who he believed could see diseases inside others. They sound fun. Suffice it to say, he was not long for respected medicine, which, might I add, at that time thought leeches were surgical instruments. One had to really try hard to be outside that box of horrors.<LF><LF>Although he tried to weather the bumps with phrenology, Elliotson's practice declined until he was virtually penniless. At which point, Mr. Starrick approached him with an offer he couldn't refuse.

Duleep Singh

Id: [0x0009BD8C]
Date of Birth: 6 September 1838.<LF><LF>The youngest son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Duleep became the last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire at the age of five. When I was five I could barely tie my shoelaces. But it was for the worst of reasons—after four of his predecessors were assassinated (just not by, you know, Assassins).
<LF><LF>His mother, the Maharani Jind Kaur, briefly ruled as Regent, but after the First Anglo-Sikh War she was imprisoned. Duleep would not see his mother again for over thirteen years. In April of 1849, Duleep Singh, age ten, was placed in the care of Dr. John Login, who did not invent logins, and at age fifteen he was exiled to Britain.<LF><LF>It was in England that he was befriended by Queen Victoria, who went on to become the godmother to several of Duleep’s children. But Duleep never forgot his real mother, and in 1856 he attempted to contact her. His correspondence and emissaries were intercepted by the British in India. However, he persisted and, with help from Login, was allowed to meet her in January of 1861.
<LF>The Maharani was deemed no longer a threat to the British interests in India and allowed to return with Duleep to the United Kingdom. In the two years before she died, she taught her son about his Sikh heritage. Duleep would spend the rest of his life attempting to return there.

Edward Hodson Bayley

Id: [0x0009BD8E]
Date of Birth: 1841 (exact date unknown).<LF><LF>Edward Hodson Bayley was not a great mover and shaker like Brunel or Starrick or any of the other transportation figures we associate with the Victorian era. What little we know about him comes from various logs, records, and transcripts. He was the son of a reverend and was educated in England, France, and Germany before settling in in Southwark. He established his carriage building business, E.H. Bayley & Co., and married an American named Josephine Simon. They had three children together.<LF><LF>According to records, Bayley patented a cart designed to distribute water or liquid manure in 1866. Imagine the sight of liquid manure as you enjoy your next cup of coffee.<LF><LF>In his later years, Bayley became involved in the Liberal Party and served on the boards of directors for multiple transportation companies, including the West Metropolitan Tramways Company and the London Road Car Company. No records show him working with the London General Omnibus Company, though. Odd.<LF><LF>Bayley was elected to the House of Commons in 1892 and lost his seat three years later. He had a quiet, peaceful retirement and died in his sleep at the age of 96, which is what we Brits call "a good innings."

Evie Frye

Id: [0x0009BD90]
Date of Birth: 9 November 1847.<LF><LF>Evie Frye was born four minutes before her brother, Jacob, and she never let him forget it. She was fierce from the moment she gasped and kicked her way into life, shattering the peaceful silence of a gracious country home.<LF><LF>Jacob and Evie’s mother, Cecily, died in childbirth. She was the only daughter of an English steelworks manager based in the Rhondda valley in South Wales. Her mother was of Welsh stock. Their father, Ethan, accepted his mother-in-law’s offer to raise the children until the age of six. He then took charge of their upbringing at his home in Crawley. 

<LF>er father raised Evie and her brother to join the Assassin order. It was a dangerous time for the Assassins in England, as the Templars tried to extend their stranglehold on London to the surrounding countryside. Evie was studious and technical—she gravitated toward the more theoretical and organisational parts of the organisation. She specialised in research, with a side interest in Pieces of Eden.
<LF>Ethan instilled in his children a strong sense of social duty -- the idea that the Assassins should help the people be free, rather than solely act as agents to take down oppressive forces. While Jacob rebelled against his father’s schooling, Evie relished his lessons. His teachings became a cornerstone of Evie’s personal creed. Her first assassination was a mill owner who was abusing and refusing to pay his staff. The incoming owner -- a member of the Brotherhood -- improved conditions greatly.

<LF>vie is valued among the Assassins for her thoughtful planning, her ability to solve problems, and her ability to see the human side of any equation.

Florence Nightingale

Id: [0x0009BD92]
Date of Birth: 12 May 1820.<LF><LF>Florence Nightingale was driven by her faith and her convictions from a young age. She knew she wanted to become a nurse when she was a little girl, but her parents disapproved of the idea, seeing it as below their upper-class station. Nightingale would later tell her associates that she received a message from God when she was 17 telling her to become a nurse. <LF><LF>That guy can be pretty specific.<LF><LF>Now, I don’t want to put down someone who did a whole lot of good for people, but that just seems a little convenient, doesn’t it? What would’ve happened if God told her to be a plumber instead?

A<LF>yway, Nightingale trained herself to become a nurse, and when Britain entered the Crimean War began in 1854, she found work on the front lines. A LOT of work. With a staff of 38 volunteer nurses and 15 nuns that she personally assembled, Nightingale was both disciplined and organised in administering care to injured soldiers. I apologise, this is starting to read like a bad CV. The point is, she was very good at her job and recognised that nurses needed to be better trained at home before being sent into battle.<LF><LF>Nightingale returned home in 1855 and established the Nightingale Fund, aimed at training nurses while the war raged on. In 1859, she published Notes on Nursing, which became the standard text used to train nurses, and founded the Nightingale Training School in St. Thomas’s Hospital the following year. The rest of her life was dedicated to advocating for women’s rights and especially better sanitation in London and India after discovering the role hygiene played in healthcare.

<LF>lorence Nightingale died in her sleep on 13 August 1910. She was 90 years old. While she left a great legacy behind, scholars these days are quick to point out that, for all of her advocacy for women’s rights, she opposed the idea of women working as physicians, or even having the vote. The hell, Flo?

Frederick Abberline

Id: [0x0009BD96]
Date of Birth: 8 January 1843.<LF><LF>A young clockmaker from Dorset, Frederick Abberline knew he was destined for bigger and more puzzling things. Joining the Metropolitan Police in 1863, it took him only two years to make a good impression and be promoted to Sergeant. He always strove to be fair and just in his line of work, but found that the law was often anything but.<LF><LF>In 1868, albeit with some hesitation, he joined forces with Jacob and Evie Frye, two justice-seeking rogues, to help rid the streets of the notorious Blighter gang that dominated the city’s underworld.
<LF>Although reluctant to look back on this unusual time in his life, his actions during this year were crucial to his career. In 1873, he became an Inspector and was transferred to Whitechapel, where he eventually led the investigation into the infamous Jack the Ripper murders.<LF><LF>Although certainly beneficial at the time, Abberline spent the rest of his life questioning whether or not his early alliance with the Fryes was ultimately just another corruption of the justice system.

Date of Birth: 30 April 1820.<LF><LF>George Westhouse grew up working in an old mill by the river in Crawley and the monotonous labour wore him down like the grain he crushed under the millstone. <LF><LF>That's right. I can be poetic.<LF><LF>One day Ethan Frye rescued him from robbers along the riverbank. A spark of adventure awoke in him and he abandoned his post, joining the Assassins. <LF><LF>He ran missions with Ethan Frye and Cecily, taking his orders from the two of them, and slowly learned to fight. He was paired with the precocious Frye twins on missions. Once Ethan died, he became the senior planner, higher ranking, at least in spirit, and assigned to orchestrate their memories. <LF><LF>All I can say is, “Good Luck.”

Date of Birth: 7 December 1843.<LF><LF>Henry is as good at keeping secrets as he is at meeting people. Many people do not, and most people will never, know that Henry was not always called Henry.<LF><LF>Jayadeep Mir was born the son of a princess and an Assassin. Arbaaz Mir, a member of the Indian Brotherhood, fell in love with Pyara Kaur, the daughter of the Maharajah Kharak Singh, while racing against the Templars to find the whereabouts of the mysterious Koh-i-Noor diamond. <LF><LF>Jayadeep was raised and trained to be a member of the Brotherhood, but, to the frustration of many, found he was more inclined towards books than he was to violence. Hoping it was just a phase, the Brotherhood sent Jayadeep out on a mission in 1860, which he ultimately failed, putting the Brotherhood at risk.<LF><LF>Jayadeep was then invited to England for a more suitable mission. He left home, but was ever hopeful that someday he would return, having proved to be a capable field agent.<LF><LF>Over the course of his time in England he adopted many fake identities, but he came to love the very simple, curiosity-shop-owning Henry Green (“Henry,” a name he heard often, and “Green” being the colour of his hat at the time). 

Ha<LF>ing made connections throughout London, he proved extremely useful upon the arrival of Assassin twins Evie and Jacob Frye. For them, he helps in their quest to bring down the Templar control in London, having consumed as much information about the city as is humanly possible.<LF><LF>While both sincere and hard-working, Jayadeep has a human side to him that many in the Brotherhood simply do not.

Date of Birth: 9 November 1847.<LF><LF>Jacob was born the younger Frye twin, to a schoolmaster and his young wife, both Assassins. His mother, Cecily, died giving birth. <LF><LF>After being cared for by their grandmother until the age of six, Jacob and Evie were taken into the family home at Crawley. A forward-thinker, Ethan Frye raised his children steeped in Assassin heritage, every night educating them in the ways of the Assassins and the world. Evie soaked up this knowledge; Jacob paid far less attention to his father's lessons and gradually came to resent them.<LF><LF>Evie was always the good student, but Jacob was the athlete. He heard and obeyed the tenets of the Creed and the instructions of the Assassin Brotherhood, but inside he was pure chaos, waiting for a chance to unleash his potential. While Evie dutifully practiced with her father, Jacob took to wild explorations late at night of the dark factories and gambling dens of Crawley and beyond.<LF><LF>With his father’s death, Jacob was finally free of his obligation as a small-town watchman. Notorious as the second-best Assassin in the London suburbs (after Evie of course), he was ready to face his destiny in the big city.

Lord Cardigan

Id: [0x0009BDA0]
Date of Birth: 16 October 1797.<LF><LF>Lieutenant General James Thomas Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan stands as a shining example of British aristocracy circa the first half of the nineteenth century; which is to say he was a pompous, blustery git who never met a failure he couldn’t buy his way out of and liked to play at soldiers with very large guns and actual human lives (or, as he might have called them, “peasants”).

H<LF> grew up in Buckinghamshire in the lap of luxury, as his father inherited the Earldom of Cardigan when young James was only 14. Despite being educated at some of the finest schools in England, he never earned a degree. I can’t find any record of when he joined the Templars, presumably because when you’re born this rich and connected the doctor removes the silver spoon from your gob, slaps you on the arse, hands you a cross pattée ring, and sends you on your way.

I<LF> 1818 he became Member of Parliament for Marlborough (a small region of Wiltshire regrettably lacking in grizzled, smoking cowboys—though if you're ever there, try a pint of Henry's at the Lamb. Ask for Jackie). This was convenient as his cousin owned the borough. Not that that stopped him from buggering off on a grand tour of Europe before taking his seat, mind; after all, one can hardly let little things like “governance” or “responsibility” get in the way of “gadding about with Russian noblewomen.” When he finally did take his seat, he was an unremarkable parliamentarian and apparently an unpopular one: during a campaign in 1832, despite having spent some £20,000 (£1,660,000 in today’s money), he was assaulted and badly beaten in a rally. I suppose that’s what happens when you loudly and frequently use phrases like “reformist nonsense” and “preserving the ancient rights of the nobility” when winning the hearts and minds of the common folk.

Having failed<LF>rather remarkably in politics, he turned his attention to the military. Spurred on by his youthful admiration of Wellington’s cavalry at Waterloo (and, I suspect, a love of all the pretty horsies), he—and I swear I am not making this up—formed his own troop of horse to “guard against reformist uprisings in Northamptonshire.” When the Northants menace failed to emerge, he joined the Hussars, where over the course of a few years he bought his way up from a lieutenant’s rank to lieutenant general and command of the 11th Hussars. Along the way he accumulated a court martial for “reprehensible conduct,” a dismissal from the army by King William himself, and a prosecution for illegal duelling, all of which he managed to have reversed or dismissed thanks to his family connections. When he was finally sent off to India to take command of his forces, he spent a year and a half meandering his way to the colony, only to arrive just in time for a bit of tiger shooting before the 11th Hussars (who had been stationed there for several years) to be recalled to England. Lord Cardigan (he inherited the Earldom in 1837) travelled separately aboard a private yacht, because of course he did.

If I d<LF>dn't think he was such a tit, I'd love him.<LF><LF>Despite a long and illustrious career of absolute faffery, Cardigan is most famous for leading the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. Although initial rumours suggested that he absented himself from the battle altogether, it seems he did in fact lead the charge, and from the front, no less—whatever his faults, he certainly possessed that breed of personal courage that comes from the certainty that the world would never dare lay a hand on you. Mind you, he also apparently never bothered to look back to see that his men were being slaughtered and, upon realising that the battle was lost, he retired to his private yacht for a champagne dinner, so it’s not as though he was seized by the spirit of gallantry.

<LF>fter the war, Cardigan returned to England, where he spent his retirement vigorously campaigning against reform and for his own recognition as a hero of the Crimea. In his (very slight) defence, he did contribute a great deal of money to many veterans’ charities, and toward the end of his life he campaigned in favour of the Reform Act of 1867, but since that law served chiefly to bring the House of Commons under the dominance of the upper classes, that strikes me more as Templar machinations than any sort of change of heart.
<LF>But at least from him we get the cardigan sweater, beloved of hipsters and children’s TV presenters the world over.

Karl Marx

Id: [0x0009BDA6]
Date of Birth: 5 May 1818.<LF><LF>Born in Trier, in what was then the Kingdom of Prussia, Karl Marx was a philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. <LF><LF>Marx studied at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. Afterwards, he wrote for a radical newspaper in Cologne, and began to work on the theory of the materialist conception of history. In 1843, he moved to Paris, where he continued to write for other radical publications. It was there he met Friedrich Engels, who become his friend and frequent collaborator. After he was exiled, he and his family moved to London in 1849, where he continued writing and developing his theories about social and economic activity. Real page-turners.<LF><LF>Marx published many books during his lifetime, with the most recognizable being the Communist Manifesto (1848) and Das Kapital (1867-1894), which arguably laid the foundation for our current understanding of the relationship between labor and capital. But perhaps his greatest contribution to society was to inspire millions of young men around the world to grow disastrous neck beards, wear skinny jeans, and bloviate endlessly about the “capitalist machine” whilst drinking thimbles of artisanal coffee in neighborhoods that cats wouldn’t be caught dead pissing in.

Lucy Thorne

Id: [0x0009BDA8]
Date of Birth: 8 August 1837.<LF><LF>Lucy Thorne was born middle-class in London. Her father was a successful but stuffy tea merchant. Her mother was well-educated and the daughter of a minor noble house—she liked the good things in life, and grew up among relative luxury... however, increasing family debt would become a problem in her adulthood. 
<LF>Lucy was clever and quick as a child. Her mother educated her in all of the qualities that should have ensured her a successful marriage, but Lucy decided instead to immerse herself in books. She branched out into the study of obscure religious knowledge, into magic and occult philosophy. All really useful stuff in a marriage. In Lucy’s teens, her father struggled to run his business and pay for his family’s needs. Lucy’s home life went downhill quickly as less money came in and more went to pay debts. She was encouraged to find a husband who could provide for her. Instead, she took on work as a shop girl in her father’s business, gradually taking on more of the management.

In<LF>her spare time she grew more and more taken with occult philosophy and supposedly magical objects, such as the Shroud of Turin. She collected rare manuscripts, overspending on auctions of rare papers. When she outbid Crawford Starrick at an auction, he tracked her down and attempted to buy the papers.<LF><LF>Lucy wouldn’t sell, but her enthusiasm for the topic appealed to Starrick, and he quickly introduced her to the Templar Order, where she became his second-in-command. So her parents needn't have worried—it all worked out wonderfully!

Lydia Frye

Id: [0x0009BDAA]
Date of Birth: 19 March 1893<LF><LF>Born into relative comfort, Jacob’s granddaughter Lydia was initially reluctant to enter into the “family business,” preferring to concentrate on her studies. However, it was this very education that showed her just how much influence the Templars still held over the history of the world. After seeing friends and family fall in the secret battle, she decided to join the fight.

L<LF>dia’s parents were often engaged in Assassin missions across the continent, so the role of instructor fell to her grandfather Jacob and great-aunt Evie. She became a very well-balanced Assassin, one who could carefully assess any situation and strike with precision, but one who could also think for herself and improvise when a plan fell through.
<LF>Lydia fell in love with a fellow Assassin named Sam Crowder and they were married shortly before the outbreak of the First World War. Assassins from all across Europe were pulled in every directon, in order to have a presence in every theatre of war and seat of power. While Sam, along with many others from the British Brotherhood, enlisted in the army, Lydia took it upon herself to stay and watch over London. <LF><LF>After securing the elder Fryes safely away in the countryside, Lydia returned to London, and worked alone to protect it not only from German spies and the manipulative British Rite of the Templar Order, but also from any new and strange threats that sought to take advantage of the chaos.

Malcolm Millner

Id: [0x0009BDAC]
Date of Birth: 11 August 1833.<LF><LF>Malcolm Millner was the oldest of five children born to a carpenter and a homemaker in Southwark. As the first born, his parents expected great things from him, and time after time, they were disappointed. While his siblings grew up to become bank clerks, crewman, and teachers, Malcolm had a hard time grasping basic concepts. Glancing through our files, it looks like he may have been dyslexic. At any rate, the boy would lash out violently at school, and he left home when he was a teenager.<LF><LF>Millner’s name doesn’t appear again until 1864, when public records show him acquiring the Greater London Omnibus Company and renaming it the Millner Company. How did he manage to buy a bus company? Perhaps he was skilled at driving backwards… or perhaps I have it backwards, as this marks the beginning of a number of smaller bus companies dropping like flies due to fires, and disappearances, the same methods Millner would use to sabotage Attaway Transport. At this point Parisian cab companies should be taking note. 

A<LF>yhow, it looks as though Starrick Industries bought out the Millner Company in 1867, around the time that Millner himself was being investigated for arson, assault, and murder. The investigations suddenly stopped that year as well—one of the benefits of working for Crawford Starrick, no doubt.

Mary Anne Disraeli

Id: [0x0009BDAE]
Date of Birth: 11 November 1792.<LF><LF>Mary Anne Disraeli (née Viney), Viscountess Beaconsfield, was a prominent figure in British high society throughout much of the nineteenth century. She married Benjamin Disraeli in 1839, shortly after her first husband passed away, and was his constant companion, friend, and advisor until the day she died. Her affectation of a silly, scatterbrained demeanour and penchant for saying the sort of thing that made “proper” Victorians waggle their moustaches disapprovingly masked a keen political mind, and between the two of them, it was joked that Benjamin “married her for her money, but [would] do it again for love.”

(Th<LF>s is rather more charming if you realise that Mary Anne was quite skint when they married.)<LF><LF>It should be noted, though, that the Disraelis, both of whom were romantics to the core, had a rather trying marriage at first. Benjamin hid his extensive debts from her for years, and both felt the sting of public disapproval (the Victorian tabloids made today’s Bat Boy sightings and illegitimate alien love children look downright reputable). Rather than wallow in misery as is the English way, the pair once again flouted convention by working out their problems and strengthening their relationship until their marriage became the storybook romance of which they had both dreamed. 
<LF>In 1868, when Queen Victoria wanted to raise Disraeli to the nobility but he  preferred to stay in the House of Commons, Mary Anne leapt upon the proverbial grenade and was dubbed Viscountess Beaconsfield. As ever, she made waves for her refusal to abide by the accepted standards of Victorian society: at court, her outfits frequently outdid the Queen’s, and once she joined the ranks of the nobility, she seized on every opportunity to show up the ladies who had once scorned her. Yet she was also active in many charitable causes, organising aid for the less fortunate. She also put her keen political mind to work on the campaign trail with her husband, winning hearts and minds through sheer baby-kissing determination. By the time of her death, the Disraelis were celebrated throughout Britain as a shining example of the joy, contentment, and success a proper union could bring.
<LF>Mary Anne Disraeli is buried along with her husband, who outlived her by several years, at the Church of St Michael and All Angels in Hughenden, Buckinghamshire.

Maxwell Roth

Id: [0x0009BDB0]
Date of Birth: unknown.<LF><LF>Although there is no record of Maxwell Roth’s existence, there is the story he likes to tell.
<LF>He tells the tale of a boy named Oberon who was born and raised by loving parents who acted in a traveling theatre troupe. Here the boy learned to sing, dance, recite Shakespeare, and charm the masses. But times were tough on the nomadic thespians, and they turned instead to a life of crime in an attempt to make ends meet, thieving and defrauding between performances. <LF><LF>With their reputation worsening as time went on and the emotional toll of an illegal lifestyle robbing them of their passion, the close-knit group soon disbanded and parted ways. This broke the young Oberon's heart. Though it fills mine with joy, because I bloody hate nomadic thespians.<LF><LF>In a vain attempt to console the boy, his parents assured him that there is always “a reason for everything” and moved with him to London. Unfortunately, even there they found themselves haunted by the ghost of their past and thus unable to find steady work. Instead, the family lived on the streets, the boy in and out of workhouses. 

<LF>istfully regarding rich families from afar, Oberon would often complain to his parents that life wasn’t fair, and again they told him that there was "a reason for everything.”

<LF>ne day, he had had enough. In an attempt to recapture the happiness he recalled from his days in the troupe, he assumed the name of Maxwell Roth and ran away to join the circus, in whatever capacity they would allow. Under the Big Top he excelled, learning everything from acrobatics to boxing to sleight of hand. When this new life went the way of the former, Maxwell did not let his failure get him down; instead, he returned to London and set out to apply his skills to the criminal underworld. <LF><LF>As the years went on, Roth was in and out of prison, worked numerous jobs (from street cleaner to gun-for-hire), and gained a reputation as an extraordinary but dangerously uncontrollable bare-knuckle boxer. Quite the CV so far! In his most emotionally charged moments, no other boxer could bring him down. Within a few years, his deadly combination of brains and brawn saw his network expand, and his infamy grow. Some men worked for him, others simply owed him money, but all feared him.<LF><LF>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that he was soon sought out by Templar Grand Master, Crawford Starrick. Starrick offered Roth an incredible sum for his expertise and assigned him the training of seven powerful soldiers that could lead a mighty gang and dominate the streets of London. <LF><LF>Now a rich man, Roth bought and refurbished a burnt-out theatre in the Strand, what is now called the Alhambra Music Hall. Roth made this his base of operations, all the while maintaining a legitimate facade by funding shows for the public to enjoy. <LF><LF>As his time under Starrick’s employment moves ever forward, Roth grows increasingly frustrated at Starrick’s control over his life. But he has learned to hope for a future out of Starrick’s grasp, knowing there may not be a reason for everything.

Ned Wynert

Id: [0x0009BDB6]
Date of Birth: 5 October 1840.<LF><LF>Although born in New York City, Ned always dreamed of traveling to London. He must have been quite a fan of rain. Not only was an escape abroad attractive to his inquisitive young mind, but the British Empire held the potential for extraordinary criminal activity.<LF><LF>Ned Wynert (née Henrietta “Netta” Mary Wynn) was raised in American “polite society” and was expected to play the part, but longed for a life outside social constraints. Always clever, he learned how to sneak away from home while no one was watching. By day, he would play the part of the respectable little girl, but by night he was a boy and, disguised, found a home on the streets among petty thieves and darker influences. No one ever made a connection between the two personae, and Ned soon began making a name for himself as a notorious jewel thief. Once he had amassed sufficient funds, he left home for good, and utterly abandoned his old “Netta” identity. Which seems a shame, because she sounded fun.

Ned q<LF>ickly excelled in the criminal underworld, but struck it big only after proving his talents and being recruited by America’s most famous thief: Adam Worth. Seeing Ned’s obvious talent for scheming and schmoozing, Worth gave him a very important mission that just so happened to mirror the young man’s dream: set up a crime syndicate in the heart of the British Empire.

I<LF> wasn’t hard for Ned to make friends when he did reach London, and it wasn’t long before his plan was underway. He made his base of operations in Southwark, specialising in theft, and assembled a group of hardworking, loyal thieves to aid his cause. There was only one obstacle remaining on his path to achieving true success: the Blighters.

<LF>uck would find Ned again, however, when in 1868 Ned stumbled upon the most beautiful train he had ever laid eyes on. The owners of the train, twin Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye, agreed to take out the Blighter presence, provided Ned let them keep whatever booty they discovered on their journey across London.

His father went door to door selling buttons and bits of tin, which was apparently a job back then, while his mother made do salvaging fabric from distressed bumbershoots. That's right. Distressed bumbershoots. Nigel and his siblings (there appear to have been two brothers and a sister) formed a musical ensemble with the intent of busking at the docks. This project met with failure, however, when Nigel, surprised by a recalcitrant goose, swallowed his mouth harp.<LF><LF>Upon Nigel's sixteenth birthday, his parents determined to move north, where, as Nigel's father claimed, "the hogs drink beer just as you or I!" However, Nigel unaccountably became separated from his family at the train station and was left to shift for himself.

Twopenny was to run things day to day for Hunt. Perhaps Mr. Hunt was paid off in Mauritian sugar.

Dear Mother and Father,<LF><LF>I know that you have fretted over me ever since I decided to come here, but I am having a most wonderful time and learning to become a man at last. The lads like to tease me because I am so slight, just as they did back home, but with a rifle in my hands I am just as strong as any of them. Yesterday we stopped for a very pleasant afternoon in a small Belgian market square, sharing cigarettes under the sun, and this morning we marched alongside the Mons canal (Dad will be able to find it in our book of world maps, I’m sure). We’re all ready and eager to face the Germans and put an end to this silly war. They’ve got to learn they can’t bully the world like this, and we’re going to teach them a lesson. I’ll be back home in weeks and I can start work at the factory, just like you wanted. They won’t turn a war hero away!

Bishop

Id: [0x0009BDCA]
Date of birth: Unknown<LF><LF>Here’s the thing, and it’s a thing that quite annoys me: I don’t know anything about Bishop.

A<LF>few years back, Rebecca and I stumbled upon a hacker collective calling themselves “the Initiates.” They built an impressive little network and had been spying on Assassins and Templars alike for years. A few of them even managed to infiltrate an Assassin cell.

<LF> gave them a rousing speech, as I often like to do, and managed to convince them to join our side. Just like that, a new Assassin network was born. I was kind of under the impression that Rebecca and I would be responsible for them.<LF><LF>(Is “Finders Keepers” one of the tenets of the Creed? Maybe it should be. –RC)

B<LF>t along comes William bloody Miles, who simply said “This is Bishop, and she’s in charge of the Initiates now.” And that’s what it’s like with Grumpy Old Bill, you know. He just kind of tells you how it’s going to be. 

(SO <LF>rumpy. –RC)
<LF>So that’s how I met Bishop. I know WHAT she does, she is kind of a central controller and dispatcher for Assassins around the world. She makes sure that when a Templar pops their head up, an Assassin is waiting to cut it off. Or if there’s a new set of genetic memories to synchronize, she finds us a helpful soul like you to help synchronize them. 

<LF>hich is all well and good. But I still don’t know WHO she is and quite frankly I’m loathe to admit it drives me batshit crazy. I joined the Assassins by uncovering the greatest conspiracy theory known to man, and yet I can’t find anything on this woman.

E<LF>eryone’s got a theory. Gavin thinks she’s former CIA. My friend Harlan thinks she’s a defector from Erudito, another hacker collective that no one’s heard from in a while. Rebecca tells me that she actually knows the truth, but promised not to tell me.

The Royal Mews

Id: [0x0009BDCC]
The name the Royal Mews, despite being first and foremost a stable for the royal family, derives from its use as a home for the family's hunting falcons and hawks. "Mews" is a term for the time of year when the birds of prey shed their feathers, and not, as you were thinking, the noise a pretty kitten makes.<LF><LF>The Royal Mews moved to this spot in 1760, when King George III decided to relocate to Buckingham House. When George IV took the throne in 1820 and set about converting Buckingham House into a palace, he commissioned John Nash to rebuild the stables with grandeur. Further improvements were made to the Mews when Queen Victoria moved into Buckingham; Prince Albert had a new forge installed and additional cow sheds built onto the Mews. You can never have enough cow sheds in Central London.<LF><LF>In 1855, Queen Victoria used her own money to establish the Buckingham Palace Royal Mews School, which served to educate the children of the stable's servants. The Mews had nearly 200 employees at the time, and accommodations were built for them and their families in 1859.

Richmond Terrace

The eight houses, long since demolished, that made up Richmond Terrace were built in 1822 by George Harrison—the architect, not the Liverpudlian sitar enthusiast. They were opulent, Greek-influenced homes designed to attract only the elite of London homeowners. All eight homes were bought and occupied by 1825; one of the first eight homeowners, former Secretary of State William Huskisson, achieved some unfortunate fame as the first widely publicized case of death from being hit by a train, in 1830. At least he was first. Imagine being the second. 
<LF>Another homeowner, Sir Robert Farquhar, was a Member of Parliament who served as the Governor of Mauritius. The eighth house was purchased by the General Board of Health in 1850 and became their main office.

Wellington Arch

Id: [0x0009BDD4]
Wellington Arch was commissioned by King George IV in 1825 to honor the victory of the British Army, led by the Duke of Wellington, over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo ten years earlier. The arch was designed by Decimus Burton—a man on the shortlist for the Coolest Name Ever Award—with the intention of serving as a gateway to Buckingham Palace.

<LF>he arch was originally unadorned due to financial setbacks, but in 1846 a statue of the Duke of Wellington on horseback was built by the artist Matthew Coates Wyatt and erected atop the Arch. The statue, which stood nearly 30 feet tall, was considered too large for the Arch and was critically derided. It was considered "the greatest sculptural fiasco of the nineteenth century," and even Queen Victoria is quoted as referring to the statue as an eyesore. The statue was removed in 1883.<LF><LF>Now, this might not be super-obvious, but Wellington Arch is a hollow structure. The interior of the arch was used at the time as a police station, making it the second-smallest police station in London. The smallest police station in London—which is also said to be the smallest in the world—is still there today, on the southeast corner of Trafalgar Square. Only one person can fit in at a time, which is a bit of a problem if you're trying to lock someone up.

Id: [0x0009BDD6]
Also known as the Actors' Church, St. Paul's, Covent Garden has been associated with London's theatre scene since the Theatre Royal was built on Drury Lane in 1663. Commemorative plaques honouring Britain's finest actors line the inside walls of the chapel. Some of the plaques that are up today honour the likes of Charlie Chaplin and Boris Karloff. The Tramp and Frankenstein. Now there's a crossover I'd pay to see.<LF><LF>And yes, I know the monster is not named Frankenstein. I just wanted to piss off the nerds. Hello nerds! Tricked you!<LF><LF>St. Paul's, Covent Garden was the first chapel built after the Protestant Reformation. When the Earl of Bedford commissioned architect Inigo Jones, he requested that the chapel be "not much better than a barn," to which Jones supposedly replied, "Then you shall have the handsomest barn in England."<LF><LF>Jones himself had a background in theatre, having staged over 500 productions with such playwrights as Ben Jonson, making the theatre's association with the stage all the more appropriate.<LF><LF>The chapel was built in 1633. Its portico is the setting for the opening scene of George Bernard Shaw’s play Pygmalion, which has been performed and adapted countless times all over the world.

Scotland Yard

Id: [0x0009BDD8]
This plot of land, and the castle that stood here, was given to King Kenneth III of Scotland as a gift from King Edgar the Peaceful in the tenth century, and for nearly 600 years served as the residence for the Scottish monarchy whenever they visited England. <LF><LF>Sorry, but... Edgar the Peaceful—what a terrifying nickname. His enemies must have been quaking in their boots. "Hide, lads! It’s Edgar the Peaceful! And he’s carrying flowers!"

T<LF>e palace was demolished when Scotland unified with England, and a series of government buildings and residences were built in its place. Christopher Wren and John Milton each lived for a time in this neighbourhood.<LF><LF>When Prime Minister Robert Peel created the Metropolitan Police Service in 1829, it was decided that their headquarters would be located in this vicinity. The office's rear entrance stood on Great Scotland Yard, therefore the police force became commonly known around the world as Scotland Yard. <LF><LF>That the word "Great" didn't make it to Scotland Yard's nickname might be a statement of some kind. Mind you—better than just calling it "the Rear Entrance." "Come on, son—you're nicked. I'm taking you up the Rear Entrance."

<LF>he formation of Scotland Yard unified the disparate police forces that operated in different parts of London and was an instant success. By 1874, Scotland Yard employed nearly 10,000 people and expanded into several neighbouring buildings.

The Admiralty

Id: [0x0009BDDA]
The first ever designed office building in London, the Admiralty (also known as Ripley Building for its designer Thomas Ripley) was built in 1726 for a now-defunct organisation called, appropriately, the Admiralty. It's amazing how they come up with this stuff. Anyway, the Admiralty served as the authority in charge of the Royal Navy, which is just what you’d expect from an organisation called the Admiralty. The U-shaped building contained a board room, state rooms, and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. This allowed those lucky prancing lords to live and work from home, probably doing absolutely bloody nothing, making them very much the freelance web designers of their day.
<LF>By 1759, the city had widened the street in front of the Admiralty, which cut into their courtyard. The Lords of the Admiralty commissioned a new façade to run along the street—the Admiralty Screen, as it’s called, is still there today, hiding the dull administrative building behind it with Greek classicism. My least favourite kind of classicism.

<LF>n 1964, the Admiralty became the home of the newly established Department for International Development. I have no idea what that is, because I fell asleep just typing its name.

Chapel Royal

Id: [0x0009BDDC]
Originally the Banqueting Hall for the Palace of Whitehall, this building was constructed in 1622 from the designs of Inigo Jones. The Banqueting Hall was used by King James I to host receptions and performances that combined poetry, music, dance, and costumes. I can't tell you how close those words are to my literal definition of hell. These performances, or masques, or absolute embarrassing travesties, were a trademark of the Stuart dynasty and often promoted the divine power of the monarchy. <LF><LF>Perhaps this is why I can never trust a man named Stuart.<LF><LF>Of course, none of this did much good for Charles I—his disputes with parliament sparked the English Civil War, and old Charlie was executed in front of the Banqueting Hall in 1649. Always embarrassing.
<LF>When the Palace of Whitehall burned down in 1698, the Banqueting Hall was the only building to survive. A banqueting hall without a palace is not much of a banqueting hall—as my mother always said—so the building was converted to replace the also-burned-down Chapel Royal of Whitehall. These really were times when anything could happen. But it was mainly buildings burning down.

<LF>n 1809, a second gallery was built onto the chapel in order to accommodate larger military services. It remained a Chapel Royal until 1891 when, with Queen Victoria's approval, it was converted into a museum. It remains, as yet, unburnt.

Dover House

Id: [0x0009BDDE]
Since 1885, this mansion has been the home of the Scotland Office, a government department under the umbrella of the Department of Justice dedicated to the needs of the Scottish people. Which is mainly whisky and umbrellas. The house was built in 1755 by Sir Matthew Fetherstonhaugh, a Member of Parliament. Fetherstonhaugh died in 1774—possibly from a lifelong illness called "Having to Constantly Keep Spelling Out My Name for People Fatigue"—and his widow sold the property to Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, thirteen years later. The Prince renovated the mansion, giving the mansion its signature portico and circular hall, before trading the property for Lord Melbourne's home in Piccadilly in 1792. 

<LF>he mansion, which was then known as Melbourne House, wasn’t given the name Dover House until 1831, when George James Welbore Agar-Ellis, another sufferer of name spelling fatigue who had just purchased the mansion the previous year, was given the much-easier title Baron Dover. Agar-Ellis and his son would be the last private owners of Dover House before the government made it the Scotland Office.

Montagu House

Id: [0x0009BDE0]
Right, so one thing I discovered putting together this research: there’s more than one Montagu House. I know. Try and calm yourself. The first one, built in 1675 and belonging to Ralph Montagu, would eventually become the home of the British Museum. This is not that Montagu House.
<LF>In 1731, Ralph's son John sold his father's house and bought up three adjoining plots of land in Whitehall. On these plots, he sought to build a larger, grander house than his father's—Sigmund Freud would've had some things to say about this. Mind you, that bloke said a lot of stuff, and most of it was about your mum.
<LF>Hey! My first "your mum" joke! <LF><LF>Anyway, in reality, the second Montagu House was a relatively modest mansion by the standards of the day—keep in mind the property was over 4,300 square feet, so to hell with eighteenth-century standards. John Montagu died in 1749 and the house became the property of his daughter Mary and his son-in-law George Brudenell. That's right—James Brudenell’s great-grandfather owned this house for about 40 years. 

O<LF> at least, he owned the house that used to be here.<LF><LF>In 1859, the house was demolished by its latest owner, Walter Francis Scott, who was James Brudenell's second or third cousin, if I'm tracking this family tree correctly. I hope you're taking notes. In three years' time, Scott had built in its place this French Renaissance-inspired mansion, which contemporaries called a "palatial residence." It was designed by the architect William Burn, known for the hospitals and castles he designed in his native Scotland.<LF><LF>The house was acquired by the British government in 1917 and converted into office space. That is the dream of every piece of classic architecture, isn't it? "Oh please! Allow me one day to be converted into a workspace housing petty squabbles and bad coffee and Maureen who can't work Excel and lit by only the most jaundicing of  strip-lighting!" Anyway, it was demolished in 1950, so that dream was over pretty fast.

The Foreign Office

Id: [0x0009BDE2]
By the time George Gilbert Scott was hired to design and build the new Foreign Office building, the original building had fallen into such disrepair that Foreign Secretary Lord Malmesbury was nearly crushed to death when a piece of the ceiling fell on his desk in 1852. <LF><LF>A contest was held to find a design for the new building in 1857, and although Scott’s design only came in second place, he was hired for the job at the insistence of Prime Minister Derby, who loved Scott's Gothic style. Before Scott could get any work done, however, Lord Palmerston was elected Prime Minister and demanded that Scott build the Foreign Office in a Classical style. The problem was this: Scott hated Classical architecture. But this was a well-paying job and Scott did not want to lose the money, so he caved. The Foreign Office was finally built in 1868, in a Classical Italianate style. Neither Scott nor Palmerston liked the building. Good job, guys!
<LF>Not to waste his own hard work, Scott modified his original Gothic design and used it to create the hotel of St. Pancras station. St. Pancras is now where the French arrive, thanks to a direct train they can take from Paris. <LF><LF>I'll never understand why we made it so easy for them.

Horse Guards

Id: [0x0009BDE4]
The Horse Guards is the official headquarters of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, the squadron that makes up the Life Guard of the monarchy.<LF><LF>This site used to be the tiltyard of the Palace of Westminster in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Tudor dynasty held extravagant jousting tournaments on this site that were reportedly attended by thousands of spectators. The tiltyard was also used for fireworks and bear-baiting matches. Not simultaneously.<LF><LF>The first building on this site was constructed in 1641, after the tiltyard was closed for what historians have called "some serious disturbances." Don't ask. The first Horse Guards was built in 1665 and torn down in 1749 after the building deteriorated to such a degree that soldiers and horses were in near-constant danger of being crushed by falling debris. I think I've used those builders.<LF><LF>Construction on the Horse Guards seen today began in 1750, and the Queen’s Household Cavalry moved into the building five years later. In the ensuing years, two areas of the Horse Guards gained a reputation for the, shall we say, "non-military activities" that took place there. The first was a cockfighting pit uncovered in the basement; the second was a public coffee house that attracted prostitutes. You know how they adore lattes. Police often arrived on the scene to settle disputes and disorder, only to be turned away by the military. The coffee house finally closed in 1850.

Big Ben

Charles Barry was hired in 1844 to rebuild the Houses of Parliament, which had burned down ten years earlier. It was decided the new building should include a clock tower and Barry enlisted the reputable clockmaker Lewis Vulliamy to design the clock itself.<LF><LF>Big Ben is the name commonly used for the entire clock tower, but it was originally the nickname for the largest bell in the tower. The clock tower is now officially known as the Elizabeth Tower, after Queen Elizabeth II. Because reasons.<LF><LF>The origin of the nickname "Big Ben" has been boiled down to two theories: the first is that it derives from Sir Benjamin Hall, the portly Commissioner of Works. The other theory is that the nickname comes from the world of boxing. Heavyweight fighters of the time were sometimes called "Big Bens," after the heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt.<LF><LF>Each clock dial is engraved at its base. The engraving reads, in Latin, "O Lord, keep safe our Queen Victoria the First."

Spitalfields Market

Id: [0x0009BDE8]
Spitalfields, an old neighbourhood in London’s East End, took its name from the hospital that was built there in 1197, St. Mary’s Spittle. And by spittle, they didn’t mean there was a saint called Mary who liked to spit when she talked. The word is an abbreviation of "hospital" and was generally used to mean hospitality in Middle English. Which is the very opposite of spitting in someone’s face.

As<LF>Spitalfields became less of a field and more of a developed neighbourhood in the late seventeenth century, a silk-thrower named John Balch acquired the rights to hold a market in the area every Thursday and Saturday. The market, which sold only fruits and vegetables, was a quick success.<LF><LF>Spitalfields, like most of the East End, was populated by immigrants to England, and shortly after the market opened, London experienced a wave of incoming French Huguenots who had just been expelled from France for their religious beliefs. Many of the French Huguenots who settled in Spitalfields were skilled silkweavers, and sold their wares at the Spitalfields Market. It wasn’t long before the market became synonymous with its luxurious silk, and all of Spitalfields gained a very positive reputation as a result.
<LF>In 1875, the market’s lease passed to a developer named Robert Horner. Horner fought regularly with the Whitechapel District Board of Works over how the market could be expanded without disturbing traffic around the market. An iron and glass roof was built in 1883, and the surrounding shops were built over the next century.
<LF>Spitalfields, and the East End in general, fell in esteem as time went on. By the nineteenth century, the silkmakers had long moved on, and overpopulation and poverty led to a rise in crime. The market remained an important fixture, providing the food needed to get through the day to those who could afford it.<LF><LF>It’s still there today, though in recent years it’s fallen to corporate chains and to stalls that think charging two hundred quid for a pillow with a cat drawn on it by an art student is good business.

<LF>h—and if you’re a Ripper fan, it’s directly opposite the Ten Bells pub, where various of Jack’s victims enjoyed a quiet pint while they still could… raise a glass to them sometime.

Covent Garden

Id: [0x0009BDEA]
The name is a corruption of its original name, Convent Garden, which gives a clue as to the site’s original purpose. I’d make that clue more obvious, but I’m worried I’d make a "habit" out of it (megalolz). Once a garden belonging to Westminster Abbey, the land was tilled and worked by Benedictine monks, until King Henry VIII seized the land in 1536—a consequence of Henry’s separation from the Catholic Church. The land was in turn granted to John Russell, the 1st Earl of Bedford, who showed little interest in the land and left it unattended. Don’t tell anyone living in a "compact and bijou" million-pound studio flat that there was a point in time where people didn’t give a toss about London real estate. The land stayed in the Russell family, unused, until the 4th Earl of Bedford inherited the land in 1627. He hired Inigo Jones to design and build a piazza on the property – the project, inspired by the piazzas of Italy and the first of its kind in England, was completed in 1631, and remains to this day the very best place in England to go if you want to see men sprayed silver standing very still and expecting to be paid for it.

The ear<LF>iest reference to Covent Garden as a market dates back to 1654. For roughly 16 years, the market that operated there was an informal organization. Samuel Pepys reports seeing an Italian puppet show in the piazza in 1662, indicating more activities occurred at Covent Garden at this time than just trade. King Charles II formally granted the Earl of Bedford market rights in 1670, officially allowing the landowner to profit from the business that occurred on his property.<LF><LF>The Covent Garden Market was moved to a new location south of the Thames in 1974.

National Gallery

Id: [0x0009BDEC]
By the end of the eighteenth century, many European governments were acquiring treasured art collections and putting them on display in grand museums. The Uffizi in Florence, the Louvre in Paris, and the Vatican Museums in Rome all popped up at roughly the same time and captured the imaginations of the continent. <LF><LF>Not to be outdone, King George IV encouraged Parliament to buy the residence of a newly deceased banker and art collector by the name of John Julius Angerstein—he sounds like a happy chap. Angerstein’s art collection included works by Rembrandt and Rubens, and was displayed in his residence at Pall Mall. The year was 1824, and this was the first National Gallery of England. The residence proved to be far too small to compete with the other museums of Europe, and so the National Gallery moved to the building which it now occupies, off Trafalgar Square, in 1832. The building was designed in a neo-classical fashion by architect William Wilkins, and its location, equidistant to both the wealthy West End and the lower-class East End, meant that people of all socio-economic backgrounds could access the museum.

Alhambra Music Hall

Id: [0x0009BDEE]
Back in 1854, this was the home of a scientific institute known as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art. Apparently science was a bit of a bore for most people back then because the institute went bankrupt two years later. The building was purchased by E.T. Smith, the famous circus proprietor. He added a circus ring to the interior and for a short time, the Panopticon became the Alhambra Circus. Smith changed tactics in 1860, converting the circus to a theater and renaming the whole thing the Alhambra Music Hall.<LF><LF>The Alhambra was one of the first music halls in London to compete with what was considered "legitimate theatre." Rather than presenting a dramatic narrative, music hall performances were made up of multiple different acts, including singing, dancing, and magic. One show could have as many as 20 acts and run up to four hours long. Oh, those are the BEST evenings, aren't they? These performers often played in multiple music halls over the course of a single night, and would run to a carriage and speed to another hall as soon as their act was finished, just to perform it again elsewhere.<LF><LF>The building itself was designed by the architect T. Hayter Lewis and inspired by the Indo-Islamic architecture of British India. Lewis gave the building such distinguishing features as twin minarets, a conical roof, and a great domed rotunda.

So wicked was the pen of Byron Cashan that it brought down an entire orchestra! Scathing review upon scathing review eventually led to the demise of the Aldwych Chamber Orchestra. Perhaps Mr. Cashan was distracted by his irregular friendship with his caretaker's wife, and did not realize that one of his neighbours was the first violinist with the ensemble that his reviews had destroyed. That very same Mr. Golden constructed his revenge with care. Taking advantage of his access to a screwdriver and a key, Golden fashioned a poisoned candle using an unusual chemical found in the basement. He turned off the gas at the mains and handed candles to his neighbours, insuring that his enemy Mr. Cashan received the Candle of Death! Critics beware!<LF>     - Henry Raymond

St. Martin-in-the-Fields

Id: [0x0009C021]
This church's curious name has two origins: St. Martin was a Roman soldier who tore his robes in half to help dress a naked beggar on a cold winter's night. In his sleep, Martin saw a vision of Christ in the form of that beggar, and he promptly converted to Christianity. The "in-the-Fields" suffix was meant to distinguish the church from another named St. Martin located in the city at the time.<LF><LF>The church as it stands today was built in 1721 on the site of an older church built in 1542 by order of King Henry VIII, who wanted to redirect the funeral processions of plague victims away from his home at Whitehall. The modern church was designed by James Gibbs, one of the most influential architects in Britain. King George was reportedly so impressed by the church that he personally paid £100 to the men who built it. That's £100 total, not each. Gibbs liked the church, but not that much. 

<LF>t. Martin-in-the-Fields's proximity to the Strand made it a popular church for the rich and upper class in the eighteenth century.

Nelson's Column is the centerpiece of Trafalgar Square and the ultimate tribute to England's most favoured war hero. While it was for the longest time believed to be just over 169 feet tall, it was discovered in 2006 to actually be 14 feet shorter. <LF><LF>Finally, historical proof that men have always lied about the size of their columns.<LF><LF>The statue of Nelson atop the column is 18 feet tall and faces the Houses of Parliament. The panels at the bottom of the column depict some of the most famous events in Nelson's life: the Battle of Cape St. Vincent, the Battle of the Nile, the Battle of Copenhagen, and of course the Battle of Trafalgar, where Nelson was mortally wounded.<LF><LF>The column was built in 1843 and cost £47,000—over £3 million in modern currency. The lions at the base of the column were commissioned in 1858 and sculpted by Sir Edwin Landseer. It was an odd choice; Landseer was a highly acclaimed painter, a favourite of Queen Victoria, but he had never once sculpted anything in his life. The lions were unveiled in 1867 to moderate praise, although some critics believed the sculptures looked more like sphinxes than lions.

Royal Society Buildings

Id: [0x0009C027]
Burlington House was one of the first three mansions built by the area that would go on to be known as Piccadilly Circus. Construction began in 1665, designed and paid for by Sir John Denham, the poet and Surveyor General of Works. Denham would sell the property two years later, before the house was completed. The largest factors leading to Denham selling the property was the passing of his wife and his own failing health. Some remnants of Denham's original building can still be seen in the current structure.<LF><LF>The property, which became known as Burlington House when the Earl of Burlington purchased it from Denham, changed hands over the ensuing years until the British government acquired it in 1854. Under the government, Burlington House became the headquarters for a number of scientific advisory boards, most notably the Royal Society of London (for Improving Natural Knowledge).<LF><LF>The Royal Society was founded in 1660 as an assemblage of natural scientists who met weekly to discuss experiments and the promotion of the natural world. The British government began paying them a stipend of £1000 a week in 1850, which began a close relationship that lead to the Royal Society being granted a home in Burlington House.
<LF>The Society’s motto is "Nullius in verba"—which basically means, "Take nobody’s word for it." A motto to live by.

Piccadilly Circus

Id: [0x0009C02D]
This landmark junction, now a festival of lights and advertisements, had very humble origins as a connecting point between three different sections of Regent Street. Piccadilly Circus was constructed in 1819, and derives its name from Pickadilly Hall, home of the famed seventeenth-century tailor Robert Baker, located nearby. Baker’s specialty was the pickadilly, a frilly collar at the height of fashion, especially in the 1620s. 
<LF>Personally, I think the frilly pickadilly is due for a comeback. Make it so, hipsters.<LF><LF>Okay, one thing I must make clear is that there was never an actual circus at Piccadilly Circus. No clowns, no animals, no eight-fingered wranglers. Circus here refers to the fact that the junction was once a circle, but the shape of Piccadilly changed in the 1880s, when Shaftesbury Avenue was created and cut through the circle.

Eleanor's Cross

When Queen Eleanor died in 1290, her funeral procession ran from the village of Lincoln, where she succumbed to a fever, to Westminster Abbey. The grief-stricken King Edward paid tribute to his late wife by placing twelve crosses at intermittent points along the route of the procession, including one at Charing Cross. This cross was the most lavish of the twelve, and the only one made of marble.<LF><LF>The cross at Charing Cross is a replica of the original that was built in 1863. The original stood on the current site of the Royal Mews; the replica was placed a few hundred metres away. The only original crosses currently standing reside in the villages of Geddington, Waltham, and Hardingstone.<LF><LF>Take note: the next time someone mentions Eleanor’s Cross, the correct response is: “Is she? Why, what’s happened?”

Kenway Mansion

Id: [0x0009C031]
The pirate-turned-Assassin Edward Kenway returned to England with his young daughter Jennifer in tow. Upon receiving a pardon from Lord Robert Walpole, he moved to London in order to work with the Assassins there. <LF><LF>Once there, he met Tessa Stevenson-Oakley, the daughter of his landlord. Using her family connections, Tessa helped Edward purchase a manor in Queen Anne's Square. They were married soon after and had a son, Haytham. The Kenways weren't like other well-to-do London families and they were a frequent subject of gossip.<LF><LF>Edward was rarely seen, often travelling about the city, and Europe, on mysterious business. Haytham was schooled inside the mansion, and rarely allowed to speak to anyone outside its walls. There was but one frequent visitor to the house, Edward's business associate Reginald Birch, who began to court Jennifer, much to her dismay.<LF><LF>Jennifer knew the truth about her father's past, and when she discovered that Birch was a Templar who was after his secrets, she tried to warn him. Birch sent mercenaries to the Kenway Mansion. Edward was killed and Jennifer was sold to Turkish slavers. <LF><LF>Oblivious to the truth, Tessa Kenway allowed Birch to become Haytham's legal guardian and take him away, while she remained in London to oversee repairs to the mansion. She died alone twelve years later, allegedly from a fall. <LF><LF>Years passed, and Haytham, now a Templar trained by Birch, found Jennifer in Damascus.  The siblings confronted Birch in Troyes, France, and killed him. Jennifer returned to London and took possession of the mansion in Queen Anne's Square. Although she and Haytham kept in touch, she was a bit bitter that her brother chose to remain a Templar, despite learning of Birch's treachery. She became quite the recluse; her only visitor of note was a young Elise de la Serre, who was visiting London on something of a soul-searching trip. <LF><LF>Out of respect for Haytham Kenway's accomplishments, the Templars made no attempt to claim the property while Jennifer was alive, despite their beliefs that there were many Assassin secrets still hidden inside it. After Jennifer’s passing in 1805, the Order quietly purchased the lot. It's not known what, if anything, any of the Kenways hid there, and even its location remained a mystery to the Assassins for many years.

Hanover Square

Id: [0x0009C033]
In 1713, the retired Colonel Richard Lumley bought four acres of land between Conduit Street and Oxford Street. Lumley needed to attract the wealthiest of the upper class in order to turn a profit, so he hired Thomas Barlow to design a stately square where he would build homes and a church. The following year, Queen Anne died and her son George, Prince of Hanover, became King George I. Lumley seized the opportunity to market his newly developed property and publicly announced that his property would be named Hanover Square, and a statue of the new king was erected in front of the church in the square.<LF><LF>The ploy worked, and the square filled with famed military heroes, politicians, and aristocrats. By the nineteenth century, some of the notable people who lived by Hanover Square included the Marquis of Salisbury and Sir James Clark, physician to Queen Victoria. On the north side of the square is the Royal College of Chemistry. Prince Albert himself laid the first stone of the building in 1846.<LF><LF>Now, that’s "laid" as in "put it down." If he’d literally laid it, I don’t think anyone would have talked of anything else since.

T<LF>e bronze statue of William Pitt the Younger standing in the square was sculpted by Sir Francis Chantrey in 1831. Even though old Pitt the Younger had been dead for over 25 years, a statue in his honour was so controversial that protestors attempted to pull down the statue the same day it was erected.

Crimean War

Id: [0x0009C038]
In perhaps the pettiest reason to start a war since the Americans got a bit shirty over our borrowing of their sailors in 1812, the Crimean War (1853-1856) began as a disagreement over whether Catholic or Orthodox Christians should control the churches in the Holy Land. (Of course, it was really about whether Britain or Russia was allowed to have the bigger Empire, but we don't talk about that in polite society.)<LF><LF>Casus belli was when Napoleon III sent a warship into the Black Sea to politely suggest that the Ottoman Sultan Abdülmecid I (crazy name, crazy guy) acknowledge French Catholicism as the authority over Christian sites in the Holy Land. This rather annoyed Tsar Nicholas I, since up till this point the Eastern Orthodox Church had controlled those sites, and he responded by sending two corps to the banks of the Danube. Diplomatic relations soured from there, and since the British and French were leery of Russian expansionism and had troops in the area anyways, they decided they might as well pitch in on the Ottoman side.
<LF>As you'd expect from the name, most of the conflict was fought in the Crimea, with the Russian Empire on one side and an alliance of Britain, France, the Ottoman Empire, and Sardinia on the other.  It was also one of the first truly "modern" wars, if large masses of men shooting each other over which toff got to call themselves Emperor of Wherever can be called "modern." Technology like the exploding artillery shell, the railroad, and the telegraph shaped the conflict, and the advent of photographic technology meant it was one of the first wars to be documented in the press. This was particularly delightful in that the great legacy of the Crimean war was the rank incompetence and general mismanagement on the part of the leadership of all sides. Something to really be proud of there. If you're going to be inept, be REALLY inept. For the citizens on the home front puffed up with patriotic fervour, this was a bit like going to see your favourite band in concert only to realise that they only sounded good thanks to auto-tune and ruthless editing.<LF><LF>The war ended in 1856 when the allies took the key Russian city of Sevastopol. Recognising the inevitability of defeat, Nicholas I sued for peace, and as part of the terms the Black Sea was declared neutral, Moldavia and Wallachia were made independent, and everyone more or less tried to forget the entire embarrassing debacle. It did lead to extensive calls for military reform and to nationalist movements across Eastern Europe, which doesn't quite seem worth the lives of half a million people, but what do I know?

Battle of Balaclava

Id: [0x0009C03A]
On 24 October 1854, the allied forces of Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire had settled in for a long winter's siege of the Russian port of Sevastopol. The British, under Lord Raglan, took Balaclava and the right flank of the siege. This was a problem, because the British didn't actually have the manpower to hold the right flank (see "Crimean War" re: rampant incompetence). Sensing weakness, Russian forces charged the British defences and managed to capture several redoubts and their artillery pieces. It was a major, though not ultimately significant, victory for the Russians, but the battle is most famous for that paean to incompetent leadership and senseless loss of life that is the Charge of the Light Brigade.<LF><LF>I'm sure you've read the poem (and if not, for God's sake go read a book): Cannon to the left of them, cannon to the right of them, etc. There were a lot of cannon, is the point. The whole thing is fraught with ambiguity and recrimination on all sides, but broadly, here's how it happened:<LF><LF>Lord Raglan, the overall commander of the British forces, gave the order to Lord Lucan, who commanded the cavalry forces, to send the Light Brigade to harry the Russian forces who had seized the artillery positions on the south side of the battlefield. Unfortunately, the courier who brought the order to Lord Lucan didn't deliver the information clearly enough, and Lord Lucan ordered Lord Cardigan, who commanded the Light Brigade (and was, incidentally, Lucan's brother-in-law and who hated him intensely), to charge a fortified Russian artillery position at the end of the valley.<LF><LF>(If you’re beginning to notice a common theme of "Lord This" and "Earl of Suchandsuch" massively cocking up operations, you've hit upon the key problem with allowing bored aristocrats to buy officer's commissions.)
<LF>At any rate, despite this order making as much sense as "strip naked and dance the Argentine Tango within sight of the Russian guns to demoralize the enemy," Lord Cardigan duly led his men into the teeth of the enemy artillery. The net result was that the Light Brigade suffered roughly 40% casualties, the Russians were very confused, and Lord Cardigan, upon seeing that the battle was lost, buggered off back to his private yacht for steaks and champagne.<LF><LF>It was that sort of war.

Corrupt Practices Act

Id: [0x0009C03C]
Rigging elections was a national pastime in nineteenth-century Britain, and by 1868 things had gotten so bad it just wasn't sporting anymore. Thus, Prime Minister Disraeli introduced this bill in order to make the process interesting again. The bill’s principal effect was to transfer responsibility for trying election petitions from—

<LF>ou know what? Let's slow down and back up a bit. Prior to this Act, whenever the result of a Parliamentary election was up for debate, the result was decided by a vote in the House of Commons. Shockingly enough, this meant that nine times out of ten, the candidate from the majority party turned out to have won the election after all. Disraeli's new law moved responsibility for deciding election outcomes to a special triumvirate appointed from the Court of Common Pleas, the Exchequer of Pleas, or the Queen's Bench, which meant that to rig an election you now had to buy off two judges instead of an entire House of Parliament. A much more sensible and streamlined system of corruption. It's this slow, steady march toward efficiency that makes the British government the finest in the world.

Disraeli/Gladstone Rivalry

Id: [0x0009C040]
One of the great political feuds of all time, right up there with Antony/Augustus, Medici/Pazzi, and Louis XVI/angry mob, the Disraeli/Gladstone rivalry got its start in 1846, when they found themselves on opposite sides of a repeal of the Corn Laws. Riveting stuff, I know. And as much as it would thrill me to no end to delve into the intricate minutiae of the moral, ethical, and political reasons these two hated each other on sight, let's be honest, you’d never read it. 
<LF>(It's amazing you're even reading this. –RC)
<LF>So here, instead, is a selection of quotations in which old, dead English politicians insult each other. You're welcome.<LF><LF>"Posterity will do justice to that unprincipalled maniac Gladstone—extraordinary mixture of envy, vindictiveness, hypocrisy and superstition; and with one commanding characteristic—whether Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition, whether preaching, praying, speechifying or scribbling—never a gentleman." –Benjamin Disraeli

"T<LF>e Tory party had principles by which it would and did stand for bad and for good. All this Dizzy destroyed." –William Gladstone
<LF>"If Gladstone fell into the Thames, that would be a misfortune; and if anybody pulled him out, that I suppose would be a calamity." –Benjamin Disraeli
<LF>"As he lived, so he died—all display, without reality or genuineness." –William Gladstone

<LF>A sophistical rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity." –Benjamin Disraeli
<LF>But the judges must award the final point to Mr. Disraeli, for when he learned that the Liberals referred to Gladstone as the G.O.M. (short for "Grand Old Man"), he remarked that it should rather stand for "God’s Only Mistake." From such a burn there is no recovery. And besides, the Queen liked Disraeli best.
<LF>Ah, I do love British politics.

Starrick's Soothing Syrup

Id: [0x0009C042]
There isn't a drop of this stuff left in the world—whatever wasn't destroyed was almost definitely consumed. That makes it difficult to break down exactly what went into Starrick's Soothing Syrup, but we do have some clues courtesy of Mr. Charles Darwin.
<LF>The first ingredient Darwin mentions, datura stramonium, is known to cause hallucinations, increased heart rate, and an aversion to sunlight. It was once believed that Devil's Snare was capable of turning people into mindless and utterly compliant zombies. Hence the plant's appeal to Starrick.<LF><LF>The other ingredient that we know of, opium, is… well, it's opium. The drug so addictive and debilitating people created dens for the sole purpose of consuming it and spacing the heck out. Even if the only other ingredients were vitamin C, sunshine, and rainbows, Soothing Syrup would still leave you worse off than before you drank it.
<LF>It seems as though Starrick's Soothing Syrup lived and died in 1868. No advertisements or articles about the tonic exist before that year, and hardly any exist after that year.

Unfortunately, their lives were basically a never-ending horror movie.<LF><LF>Their facility and team acquired a schematic for an early version of the Animus, and believed that if they could create the machine before Abstergo, then the Assassins would gain an edge in our long war. Unfortunately, they lacked the materials and expertise to make the damn thing work. That didn’t stop their mentor, Galina’s mother, from forcing all of the Assassins into prolonged sessions, including her twin daughters.

<LF>ver time, the Bleeding Effect began to take hold, and their scientific community was driven insane. Desperate, Galina reached out for help and found Gavin Banks, an Assassin whose mission was to find surviving cells and reconnect them to a global Brotherhood.<LF><LF>Galina led Gavin and his team back to Protvino where they euthanized the poor deranged creatures trapped inside. Galina killed her own mother and twin sister, which isn’t something I think you could consider easy, even if you often squabbled. Gavin recruited her to his team, which was good for him, as he has the unfortunate habit of getting the shit kicked out of him.

For example, when Lineage Research and Acquisition obtained Subject 17’s genetic memories, it was Isabelle who made sure that Entertainment had access to them to create virtual entertainment features.

So young Master Berg was raised by rig pigs in Afghanistan, Kurdistan, and Oman, to name a few. And that doesn’t really sound like a magical childhood, does it?

<LF>ith his father’s blessing, Berg returned to Finland to join the army. At first, they made fun of his muddled accent (technically speaking, he doesn’t even pronounce his own name correctly) but the jokes quickly stopped as Berg proved himself to be an exceptional recruit, becoming one of the youngest Special Jaeger in the Utti Jaeger Regiment. 

<LF>e met his wife Helmi in the army, and everything pointed to an intense, but unremarkable life, until his daughter Elina was born and diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. While Finland’s health care system is generally considered to be quite good, the Berg family found themselves struggling to afford the aggressive drug treatments Elina so desperately needed. 
<LF>Berg quit the army and became a well-paid mercenary, which his wife did not approve of, resulting in divorce. It’s not exactly a doctor or a lawyer, is it? Berg’s freelance activities caught the attention of Dr. Warren Vidic, who recruited him into Abstergo’s Animi Training Program in exchange for an off-the- market miracle cure. I imagine Berg’s divorce became much more amicable (though no less final) after that.

Ju<LF>t as he did in the army, Berg showed promise early on and quickly rose through the ranks, and eventually won a spot in the Inner Sanctum of the Templar Order. He was given command of Sigma Team, an elite force designed to hunt Assassins. He’s been a pain in the proverbial balls ever since.

<LF>ictoria inherited the throne at the age of 18, and she later married her first cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, in 1840, because it's nice to keep things in the family.

Which is a better nickname than "her cousin's wife".<LF><LF>After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and largely vanished from the public eye. However, her popularity recovered in the later years of her reign, which is the longest of any British monarch, or any female monarch in history.

He studied to become a surgeon at the University of Edinburgh, found work at the Hunterian Museum cataloguing plant and animal specimens, and was elected to the research arm of the Zoological Society of London in 1830. He was the youngest and most active member of the group. By which I mean he did lots of work, not that he was a jogger.<LF><LF>By the middle of the nineteenth century, scientists were theorising about the presence of the Divine in natural sciences. Owen threw his hat into the proverbial ring by publishing papers outlining his theory on the origin of Earth’s species. In essence, Owen believed that the changes observed in animals occurred as a response to their environment, and that all species not only share a common archetypal ancestor, but that all species are progressing towards an idealised form, with humans already reaching their apex.
<LF>From apes to apex. That'd make a nice title for my autobiography. <LF><LF>Oh, and if that doesn’t make a lot of sense to you, don’t worry. Owen’s contemporaries felt the same way.

O<LF>en developed a reputation for overreacting to criticism and responding in anger, crossing the line of acceptable behaviour and discourse in the scientific community. This was evident more than ever in his scathing reviews of On the Origin of Species, published by Charles Darwin in 1858. Owen stood by his own theories even as his contemporaries came to embrace Darwin and natural selection. Feeling alienated from his peers in the field of biology, Owen focused his efforts on, among other things, establishing the Natural History Museum, which he did in 1881. He was knighted three years later and promptly retired. Which is what I will do when finally the old bird knights me.<LF><LF>By the time Owen passed away in 1892, he was remembered for little more than his opposition to Darwinism and his misplaced ego.

But then, neither have you, so shut up. Ferris only surfaces as the newly-minted owner of a middling iron factory called the Bow Rail Works, which he promptly redubbed Ferris Ironworks. Police records indicate that several employees of said factory died of exhaustion. Although it may have been consumption, both because the handwriting is tough to make out and because mostly everyone died of consumption… or dysentery… consumption was more fashionable. Regardless, employees died due to maltreatment. 

<LF>s the decade continued, the average age of Ferris’s employees got younger, a reliable remedy for both exhaustion and consumption. 
<LF>Starrick purchased the Ironworks in 1862, enfolding it into his vast empire, and Ferris became a wealthy man. “And what did he do with his tuppence?” you might ask.

Date of Birth: 29 December 1809.<LF><LF>Known as “The People’s William” by his supporters—which has to be one of the weirdest nicknames I've ever heard—William Ewart Gladstone was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom four times and ranked one of the greatest Prime Ministers of all time.

Bor<LF> in Liverpool, young “Willy” was the fifth of six children to Anne Mackenzie and Sir John Gladstone. He attended Christ Church at Oxford where he studied Mathematics and Classics, served as president of the Union debating society, and became an advocate for Toryism.

<LF>ladstone was elected to Parliament in 1832. In the House of Commons he was a member of High Toryism and opposed the abolition of slavery. Eek. Later, when slavery was abolished, he helped his father collect over £100,000 from the government for having owned over two thousand slaves across nine plantations in the Caribbean. During his time in Parliament, he met and began to despise his lifelong rival, Benjamin Disraeli, appalled by his “foppish attire.”

W<LF>ereas he excelled in the House of Commons, he struggled in his social life: Gladstone had a difficult time finding a wife. After being rejected by both Caroline Eliza Farquhar and Lady Frances Harriet Douglas, he met the charming Catherine Glynn. The two were later married, and stayed together for fifty-nine years, until he passed away, because fifty-nine years must have been tiring.<LF><LF>In 1840, Gladstone took it upon himself to “rescue and rehabilitate” prostitutes, a practice he continued for the next several decades, despite the backlash from his peers.

<LF>fter leaving and returning to Parliament several times, Gladstone served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1859, and leader of the Liberal Party in 1868. He served his first premiership later that year until 1874, and then promptly retired. Angry with Disraeli’s changes during his retirement, he returned to Parliament and served another three times as Prime Minister (1880-1885, 1886, and 1892-1894).
<LF>Unlike his rival, Gladstone was known for his poor relations with Queen Victoria. She is quoted having complained about him saying, “He always addresses me as if I were a public meeting.”

<LF>illiam Gladstone died of heart failure in old age in 1898 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, his wife later laid next to him.<LF><LF>After she'd died, too, I mean.

HIS LORDSHIP'S DINNER ALE

Id: [0x0009C121]
Ivery Brewery - Bath - 1868<LF><LF>SHAUN’S TASTING NOTES:
<LF>A beer! From England’s prettiest city! And suitable for His Lordship’s Dinner, no less!

<LF>ell, the name is appropriate, as I needed a full five-course meal to get the taste of this concoction of misery out of my sad mouth. It tastes like someone drained the water table from Highgate Cemetery, strained the bits out, and bottled it under the light of a blood moon. <LF><LF>I did some historical digging on this Ivery Brewery. It burned to the ground in 1879, and do you know what? I’m glad. I hope the fire brigade sat back and watched it burn, then salted the earth because they knew that sometimes a place becomes so defiled by what’s happened there that it can never be put to wholesome use again.

<LF>his is a bad beer.

<LF>Interesting. Period advertisements for this beer suggest that the innumerable workers who dug the miles upon miles of tunnels and collectors beneath London, their nose constantly assaulted by nauseous fumes and their eyes offended by unspeakable refuses, would appreciate a balanced and moderate brew bottled in the north of Scotland, which as far as I can tell is three lies for the price of one.

Irish Brewers - Dublin Stout<LF><LF>SHAUN'S TASTING NOTES:<LF><LF>Presumably named because the ingredients have been sitting about since roughly the days of Enoch. A proper Irish stout should be pitch black, creamy in texture, with rich yet subtle notes of coffee and toasted malt. This tastes like someone watered down a pot of roofing tar, then spiked the whole thing with burning tyres. The mouthfeel is akin to licking a greasy rat, and how I know that is a story I will not be telling you. I shared the sense memory profile with a mate of mine from Cork, and he actually burst into flames. Please don’t send any more data on this one.

<LF>When I think back on all the hardship England has inflicted on our neighbours to the north—all the wars, the oppression, the outlawing of the kilt—I’m fairly sure this beer pays them all back with interest. This isn’t a beer, this is a declaration of war in liquid form. This is like being struck about the head with a caber and similar Scottish clichés. I’m going to go have a bit of a lie down and a good long think about my life choices now.

<LF>In the case of Red Growler Special Brewed, I think we’d all have been happier skipping the beer altogether and just chewing on the dried fish bladder.

The ensuing crisis of succession, civil war, and mass outbreak of food poisoning would surely plunge us into a dystopian age to make a British comic book writer of the 1980s wet himself with glee.

1866 - Lager - Birns Brewery - Registered<LF><LF>SHAUN’S TASTING NOTES:
<LF>A big, bold flavour of stomach acid finishes with notes of someone else’s old chewing gum and a smattering of pencil shavings. The beer itself has a consistency not dissimilar to egg whites that have curdled a bit, with a head like dirty linens that leaves a lacing of grey sludge on the walls of the glass.
<LF>Going by the scale of the other beers we’ve tried on this project, I’d say “3 out of five stars—would definitely order again”.

<LF>The Big Bastard lives up to its name, with an intense dishrag flavour and a mouthfeel more akin to al dente pasta than beer.

<LF>SHAUN’S TASTING NOTES:
<LF>With its strong flavour and heady aroma, this beer would pair wonderfully with halibut. I’m sorry, did I say “pair with?” I meant “tastes of,” it tastes of halibut. The body has an unctuous, pond-scum quality, but manages to be gritty at the same time. Overall I’d rate this beer somewhere between “poison oak” and “a live and furious piranha” on the “things I’d willingly put in my body” scale.

London – 1868
<LF>SHAUN’S TASTING NOTES:
<LF>There’s a very easy joke to be made here about the purity of the Thames as compared to the quality of this beer, but I’m not going to make it. No, such an obvious jab doesn‘t do true justice to the vileness of this drink. On every level on which it is possible to enjoy beer, this one is a spectacular failure. It tastes like the inside of a carburettor, it looks like something my uncle Rory had drained from a growth on his foot, and the smell—well, just be thankful Abstergo hasn’t added Smell-O-Vision technology to the Helix interface yet. I loaded this up on one of the old Animus 3.0 rigs, and now everything smells of bin juice. I think I need a CAT scan.

<LF>Ah, the mild ale—brewing’s equivalent of a beige carpet or a smooth jazz album. 

<LF>ooking back at the log files, I’m quite certain I synchronized this particular sense memory, but I’ll be buggered if I can remember anything about it. It’s like an un-memory; a flavour that is defined only by its absence. It’s almost poetic, in its way. Shame it’s really only suitable for sale to children, or American supermarkets.

Dear Father Spencer,<LF><LF>I am writing to you because I don’t wish to unburden myself to my family and you have so often been a source of spiritual solace. It’s true I haven’t always been the most diligent churchgoer in town, but I left for this war with prayer in my heart, and your words when last we spoke have been ever-present in my mind. It can only be God’s grace that allows me to write to you now, with so many of my companions suffering a worse fate. You may have read in the papers of the fighting happening by the river Somme. However terrible their accounts, and however alarming the number of casualties reported, nothing can come close to describing the horror of the battlefield. All I remember is the noise and the sliding of my boots in the mud as I ran. Only it wasn’t only mud, Father. It wasn’t only mud. Once I fell and lay in it, mercifully unconscious. I woke to find something heavy weighing me down. I lay there for what seemed like hours, too afraid to move, until someone pushed the body off me and saw I still lived. How can such things happen in the world, Father? And how are we to bear them?

Step<LF>en Bennings<LF><LF>(Sergeant Bennings returned home weeks after the Battle of the Somme and was diagnosed with shell shock.)

Dear Katie,<LF><LF>I want you to know that I am well and still in the north of France. The photograph you gave me is a constant source of comfort. No matter what is happening around me, I can look at the picture of you in your parents’ garden and feel the warmth of that summer’s day. I haven’t forgotten my vow. Soon I shall return and we shall be married, and all this awfulness will be forgotten. I ask you not to read the accounts that are appearing in the newspapers in the meantime. They will only worry you without cause. Think of me as I was on our last day, standing at the station in my new uniform. And know that the train that will bring me back will not be long now.

Y<LF>ur ever-loving, Christopher.<LF><LF>(Corporal Christopher Alben was killed in battle three weeks later.)

Dear Uncle,<LF><LF>I am recovering quite well from my wounds, so the doctors tell me. There is still such a thick air of dejection in the hospital, and we all remember the friends we’ve lost and in what a futile effort we lost them. The scenes of Dardanelles will haunt us for many years I expect, though I was pleased to hear your news from home. Churchill deserves much worse than to be cast out of the admiralty for the mess he brought us into at Gallipoli. If, as you say, he is making plans to see the Western Front for himself, then no doubt his recklessness will bring him graver punishment. I look forward to sailing home once I am sufficiently well, and appreciate your offer of a post in Westminster. I intend to do you proud, and to endeavour to win this war from the offices of London since I could accomplish so little here.
<LF>Your faithful nephew, George.<LF><LF>(Lieutenant George Featherway had a short career as a politician and prospered as a businessman after the war.)

Dear Mother,<LF><LF>Just wanted to let you know that we’ve arrived at Loos, way at the top of France. We’re not making jokes about the name now that we’re here and everyone is very nervous while we wait for the order. Everyone tells such grim stories and every day you hear something worse. I think you are right and that it was a very silly thing to do, coming here and lying on the form like that. But if you tell everyone that I’m only seventeen and that I should be sent home, everything will be all right. Ask Reverend Farrell and he can talk to the right people because I’m really not supposed to be here and I want to come back.

All<LF>my love, Francis.<LF><LF>(Private Francis Kelly was reported missing a week later. His body was never recovered.)

Dear Becky,<LF><LF>Your brother Andrew has asked that I write to you as he is presently unable to do so himself. Please don’t be alarmed though. He has only the most superficial of wounds and is recuperating nicely. He would like me to tell you that the injury was incurred during a daring one-man incursion into enemy territory, where he defeated half the German deployment while escaping with mere scratches. I feel I should succumb to the truth and tell you instead that he accidentally set off his rifle while polishing it. Luckily, the bullet only grazed his arm. He hopes you are well and that those damned zeppelins have failed to deliver their bombs anywhere near Bromley. I certainly hope to meet you one day, as your brother has told me so much about you.
<LF>Until then, I remain your faithful servant (and Andrew’s right hand),

We marched over twelve miles before we found the old trench and almost right away German shells started to hit us and shake the earth. Never was I more scared in all my life. Every night I pray for you both and see your faces when I close my eyes. Never forget that I love you,

I read little Tommy’s letter and wished I could have been there with you. You must have been so scared when those bombs started falling. Of course, Tommy thinks the zepps are the most exciting thing ever to happen to London, but you must make sure he doesn’t try to leave the house and get a better view of them if they ever come your way again, which I hope and pray they don’t. The weather here is getting better every day.

I know you wanted with all your heart that I should be there for your birthday, and I wanted it too. I hope you liked the present I sent. Hold it tight when you go to sleep and that way I will be closer to you. You must do everything Mummy tells you, and must study hard at school and make me very proud, as I know you will. Already from your letter I can see how nicely you write and how very clever you are getting. I have made a new friend here who likes to write too. His name is Wilfred and he spends much of his time writing poetry. If you’re a good little girl I will ask him to write a poem for you. Would you like that?

Shot Tower

Id: [0x0009C357]
Shot towers were an eighteenth century innovation in the creation of shot balls for shotgun ammunition. The basic concept was this: you release molten lead from the top of the tower, and as the lead falls, it forms into small balls, begins to cool, and then lands in a pit of water where it solidifies.<LF><LF>The Shot Tower of Lambeth was 163 feet tall and featured two galleries where molten lava could be dropped: one at the very top of the tower, and one at the midpoint. The gallery at the midpoint was used to produce small shot balls while the top gallery was used to produce large shot balls.<LF><LF>The tower closed its doors in 1949 and was slowly demolished over the next two years. The Queen Elizabeth Hall now stands in its place. I saw a jazz gig there once. So in many ways, it's still producing balls.

Lambeth Asylum

Id: [0x0009C359]
While Bethlem Royal Hospital, also known as Bedlam, is the asylum most associated with cruelty towards patients, the institution had largely curbed this behaviour in the early nineteenth century following some shocking exposés. England’s other notorious asylum, Broadmoor, opened in Berkshire in 1863, taking some of Bethlem’s patients in the process.

L<LF>mbeth Asylum, on the other hand, was largely undocumented over the course of its short life. Patients are identified by numbers rather than names, and records of treatment administered there are vague. Letters and contracts of the time suggest the building was designed by the architect Arthur Hayes, his first and only project, in 1850. A newspaper excerpt from 1851 tells us that Hayes was murdered in his bed by his own son, who believed his father to be the Antichrist—a claim later proved to be inaccurate. Arthur Hayes Jr. would later be admitted to Lambeth as a patient. 
<LF>Lambeth Asylum closed its doors in January of 1869 and was demolished later that year, no doubt due to the death of their sole benefactor, Crawford Starrick.

Lambeth Bridge

Id: [0x0009C35B]
Before there was Lambeth Bridge, there was a horseferry that ran between Lambeth Palace and Westminster. The horseferry dates back as early as 1513, when it was owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop was stripped of his possessions, including the ferry, during the English Civil War, and as the war went on, the ferry became an important crossing for Parliament to control to keep supporters of the king out of Westminster.<LF><LF>The horseferry went out of business in 1750 when Westminster Bridge was built nearby, but Lambeth Bridge was built on the site of the original horseferry in 1860. Designed by Peter W. Barlow to be a toll bridge, the steep approaches on either side inadvertently discouraged horse-drawn carriages from using Lambeth Bridge.<LF><LF>The bridge ceased to charge tolls when it was bought by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1877. Lambeth Bridge deteriorated fairly quickly—the suspension cables and girders began rusting a decade after construction—and was rebuilt in 1832.

<LF>'m sad this entry is finished. I love the word horseferry. I'll try to use it more in day-to-day life. But unless I buy a horse and move near water, it seems unlikely to happen. Sad face.

Blackfriars Bridge

Id: [0x0009C35D]
This crossing was originally meant to be named Pitt Bridge in honour of the former Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder, but the name never caught on. Blackfriars Bridge was built from 1760-1769 by the Scottish engineer Robert Mylne and lasted almost 100 years, requiring frequent repairs due to the sub-par limestone used in construction. It was torn down in 1864 when the government determined it would be more cost-effective to simply replace the bridge than to keep repairing it.<LF><LF>The new bridge, which is still standing, was designed by Thomas Cubitt and completed in 1869. In his Dickens's Dictionary of London, published ten years later, Charles Dickens Jr. describes Blackfriars Bridge as "one of the handsomest in London." If celebrity magazines were around back then, Blackfriars would've been called "the sexiest bridge alive."

London Bridge

Id: [0x0009C35F]
After a number of wooden bridges were built and destroyed on this location, Henry II commissioned the construction of a permanent stone bridge in 1176. The crossing, known today as Old London Bridge, was finally completed in 1209, about 30 years later. You how what builders are like. Much like the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, this bridge held a number of shops, a chapel, and even a mill. Unfortunately, the buildings significantly reduced the amount of space on the bridge for traffic to occupy—only one lane was available to traffic going each way, and it could take up to an hour to cross.
<LF>For over 300 years, London Bridge was a popular place for the people of London to gather and stare in awe at the severed heads of England's enemies. You know—like normal people do. The tradition of putting heads on pikes and showcasing them on London Bridge began in 1305 with the head of Scottish independence champion William Wallace being the first to appear on the bridge. So yet another world first for Wallace. Other famous heads that made appearances on the bridge include fifteenth century rebel Jack Cade, Oliver Cromwell, and celebrity terrorist Guy Fawkes. The practice ended in 1678, probably because it was horrible.
<LF>London Bridge was the city's only permanent crossing over the Thames until 1729. It was demolished in 1832, over 600 years after it was built, and replaced with a bridge designed by John Rennie. This bridge reportedly sank into the Thames at a rate of an inch every eight years and needed to be replaced. So, brilliantly, the British sold this rather knackered London Bridge to an American oil tycoon who wanted to have it rebuilt stone-for-stone in Arizona. Everyone was happy. <LF><LF>Except the American, who it’s rumoured actually thought he was buying the much prettier Tower Bridge, but got the name wrong. It’s still there to this day, in Lake Havasu City.

<LF>nyway, the modern London Bridge was built from 1967-1972 and designed by Lord Holford.

Monument to the Great Fire of London

Id: [0x0009C361]
The Great Fire of London began 2 September 1666 in a baker's shop on Pudding Lane. Four days later, the fire had spread throughout the city and consumed over 13,000 buildings. The fire cost the British government £10 million. That's in seventeenth century currency. In modern currency, the number is too terrifying to imagine.
<LF>The Monument to the Great Fire, commonly referred to as just The Monument, was built on the site of St. Margaret's church, the first of many churches to burn in the fire. The site is just over 200 feet from the baker's shop where the fire began. The Monument, and the brass orb that sits on top, were designed by Christopher Wren and built between 1671 and 1677. Wren had many different ideas for the brass sculpture that would rest on the monument, including a statue of King Charles II, a woman wielding a sword, and, his personal favorite, a phoenix triumphantly rising from flames. How metal. What a shame Christopher Wren didn't live to see an Iron Maiden concert. That's the tragedy no one ever talks about.<LF><LF>The Monument stands at 202 feet, and features a staircase inside it that gives the public access to the top of the column. The Monument's height and accessibility made it a fashionable site for people to commit suicide. The government built a mesh cage at the top of the Monument in the mid-nineteenth century to curb these suicides.

Holborn Viaduct

Id: [0x0009C365]
The Holburn Viaduct was built in 1869 to span the length of the old Fleet River and work was put in to make the bridge not just a necessity of infrastructure, but an artful piece of city design. It was painted in red and gold and adorned with statues. The four statues of women standing at either end of the viaduct represent Agriculture, Commerce, Science, and Fine Art.<LF><LF>When the viaduct was officially unveiled in a ceremony lead by Queen Victoria in November of 1869, it captured the imaginations of people from all walks of life and was praised as an impressive feat of engineering. It was reportedly a beautiful day with clear sunny skies. <LF><LF>I threw that last bit in because we're talking about the unveiling of a bloody viaduct here, and I'm conscious your attention may be wandering.

Ludgate Circus

Id: [0x0009C367]
Ludgate Circus and the adjoining hill of the same name sit on the outermost edge of the original Roman settlement of Londinium. The wall that ran around the settlement had six gates built into it; the gate that stood here was named after King Lud, who ruled pre-Roman Britain around 66 CE. The gate was renovated in the sixteenth century and enhanced by sculptures of King Lud and his sons, Because if there's one thing that would enhance a gate, it's a sculpture of a bloke called King Lud and his kids. Unfortunately, the city was caught in a wave of Puritanism, and the heads of the statues were quickly chopped off by vandals. The heads were replaced when Queen Mary took the throne.<LF><LF>The Ludgate was demolished in 1760, and like its big brother Piccadilly Circus, there was never an actual circus here. It used to be a circular junction, hence "circus." Riveting, isn’t it?

Even a detective can run adrift when a nefarious business is afoot! Was Detective Murphy getting too close to a secret source of "raw goods"? A leatherworker was in the habit of doing away with local folk, flaying them, and then chopping them up! He had the skin tanned for leather, the bones ground up to sell as manure, and the bloody flesh sold to supply pie-shops with cheap meat, all delivered by the unwitting carter, George. Thus did the fiend take macabre pleasure in seeing his victims happily consumed by the citizens of Fleet Street!<LF>     - Henry Raymond

I have begun to see a doctor in an attempt to calm my nerves and concentrate my mind. Dr. Alton is kind and gentle and the solicitous manner with which he listens is as beneficial as any medication." <LF>•"Oh, what a rapturous night! The timid Dr. Trevor Alton has surprising depths! We had a chance encounter in the park, whereupon he began to speak to me with such intensity and passion, I was quite swept up! Soon, his ardent kisses took my breath away. Could it be that I have found love at last? And what, then, of my engagement to Gilbert?" <LF>•"My feelings for Trevor (it seems so silly to call him 'Dr. Alton' now) are as strong as ever, but mixed with concern. He has become moody, even tormented. He complains of his experimental treatment and of his patients.<LF>    "I have told him that I plan to break things off with Gilbert." <LF>•"Trevor and I are to meet in the park this morning. Is a proposal is in the offing? If he does propose - oh, please let it be so! - I shall go directly to Gilbert and break it off with him. A swift, sharp break is best for everyone."

The Case of the Conflicted Courtship

Id: [0x0009C972]
Doctor Trevor Alton's experimental medication seemed to be so successful on one of his patients that he tried it himself, and created a monster! Going under the name of Baxter, this second, drug-altered personality lived a wild, scandalous life, seducing women as he went. The unsuspecting Prudence Browne, believing him to be Dr. Alton, fell in love with the passionate Baxter. Meanwhile, Baxter continued his seductions, which included the possessive Lulu, who later followed Prudence, planning to threaten her. Horrified by Baxter's actions, Dr. Alton resolved to marry Prudence in order to save her reputation. Baxter, however, would not have his freedom curtailed in any way, and arranged a to meet Miss Browne in the park, where he viciously murdered her. A crime for which Dr. Alton will pay the price!<LF>     - Henry Raymond

Id: [0x0009CF47]
Industrialist Matthew Killian was drugged and thrown from the top of a moving train by his former employee, Peter Jespers! Put out of work by the mechanization of Killian's factory, Peter found employment as a humble train steward. However, one evening Peter realized that Killian was on his very train (prior to this journey Peter had never seen Killian, but now recognized him from a recent newspaper article). Peter, knowing that frequent passenger Vivian often swindled wealthy fellow passengers, waited until she lured Killian to her compartment. He cunningly arranged for her to be called away by means of an anonymous note. Peter then used his considerable strength to lift the drugged magnate and drag him to the top of the train, whence he threw him to his death at midnight! Killian's rival, Angus Wolf, had hoped to get Killian so inebriated as to prevent him from participating in a business meeting on the following day, but Wolf himself fell afoul of the drugged brandy and slept through the entire episode! As for Peter the murderer ... perhaps he meted out justice, in turn he will now meet justice himself!<LF>     - Henry Raymond

Without a formal education, though, Gilbert never learned to read, and developed a deep resentment of the privilege inherent to the written word. Spiteful of the years he spent neglected by society and his own kin, Gilbert finds release in destroying printing houses.

Conjuring Up Murder!

Id: [0x0009D969]
Spiritualist Thaddeus Smith routinely swindled not just his clients, but his clients' friends and families! In city after city, Thaddeus and his confederate, "Dr." Wilburn, lured in those desperate to speak to the departed in the after-world. But the swindlers were doubly paid, first by their clients, then by those close to them, who wished to manipulate them! In such a fashion, Miss Anne Roberts hoped to gain legal authority for her brother in order to remove funds from a secret bank account; Mr. Everett Boyd wished to ensure his marriage to Janice Asquith would take place in order to gain a lucrative settlement; and Lady Ursula's butler, Douglas, wished to have her dead cat counsel her to leave her fortune to – Douglas himself!
<LF>   But none of these accounted for Thaddeus' odd quirk of enjoying giving a good lesson to his fellow swindlers once he’d emptied the coffers of his clients. Thaddeus then habitually exposed these manipulators before escaping by feigning his own death! This was corroborated by the supposed Dr. Wilburn, purporting to be simply one more client. But on this occasion, Anne realized the coming exposure, and enticed the butler Douglas (the only swindler present at the crime scene) to murder Thaddeus in the dark!
<LF>   Farewell Thaddeus! You may now speak to those in the after-world at your leisure!<LF>     - Henry Raymond

The Rooks

Id: [0x0009DEB2]
An essential part of the English ecosystem, street gangs dominated the nineteenth century underworld. In an attempt to unify the street gangs under one regime, the Templar Order created the Blighters, and attempted to remove any opposing forces to their cause. <LF><LF>The Clinkers of Whitechapel, the last remaining independent gang in London, fought in vain against the mighty oppressors. Eager to turn things around, they welcomed twin Assassins Evie and Jacob Frye into their circle. Proposing a new idea to take back the streets of London from under the Blighters’ feet, the Clinkers took on the identity of the Rooks and decided to fight under the guidance of the Frye twins.
<LF>Their main approach to undermining the Blighter influence is to sabotage their hold on different areas in the city (such as Blighter-owned factories and strongholds) and then challenge them to a final fight for the territory in a gang war.<LF><LF>Nowadays, London doesn't really have street gangs like those. It's got students in bright jackets carrying clipboards who stop you and demand your credit card details instead.

The Blighters

Id: [0x0009DEB5]
Unruly and dangerous, street gangs were a very common element of Victorian England’s ecosystem. Flourishing in poorer areas, the desire for a unified lower class spread throughout the entire country and resulted in entire criminal communities. Notable gangs such as the Scuttlers, the O’Hooligan Boys, and the Forty Elephants became infamous for their skill in theft, as well as their proclivity toward extreme violence. 

<LF>t was logical, then, to take these gangs into consideration when looking to dominate the heart of the Empire. When Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick sought to strengthen his hold over the city, controlling the underworld was a foregone conclusion. Using seven hand-picked, highly skilled Templars, and all the influence he could muster in London’s underbelly, he spent a decade building London’s most fearsome street gang to date: the Blighters.

<LF>riginating in Westminster’s worst slum, the Devil’s Acre, the Blighters’ influence spread across the entire city and its members became known for their merciless brutality and unruly nature. They didn't even say please or thank you. The Blighters, once thought to be a superior answer to the street gang plague, proved instead to be a source of greater fear and loathing for the city’s residents. Those who opposed the regime wound up either fatally injured or massively in debt.

Shroud of Eden

Id: [0x0009DEB7]
The First Civilization created many strange and powerful objects, which we refer to as Pieces of Eden. We've discovered Apples—strange spheres that can manipulate minds—powerful Swords and Staves, as well as some other objects that are a little bit less impressive.

<LF>ut perhaps one of the strangest ones has to be the Shroud of Eden. Civilians know the object as the Shroud of Turin, which some allege is the burial shroud of Jesus of Nazareth. On the surface, it's a white linen cloth stained with blood, with the imprint of a man who appears to have been crucified. <LF><LF>What we know about this object has been pieced together from various sources: genetic memories stolen from Abstergo's Project Legacy by the hacker collective known as Erudito and the semi-coherent ramblings of the Assassin Clay Kaczmarek, who was driven insane by prolonged exposure to the Animus. It apparently has the ability to heal severe injuries, but we don't know how. It has ties to a Precursor named Consus, but we've not been able to dig up anything more about him.<LF><LF>Early reports of the artifact are hidden within myths and legends: The Golden Fleece of Jason and the Argonauts, Joseph's famous multicoloured coat, and it allegedly helped David fell Goliath. Yet its most famous owner is undoubtedly celebrity carpenter Jesus, whose resurrection was apparently facilitated by the Shroud. <LF><LF>It bears mentioning that other than Jesus, there are no reports of any Piece of Eden capable of bringing back the dead, and until I see it for myself in an Animus or otherwise, I remain a complete skeptic. To me it's just a fancy napkin. Dead is dead, no matter how much I might wish otherwise.<LF><LF>The object's been stolen back and forth between the Assassins and Templars over the centuries. The last report was that the Templars had managed to acquire it in the 1940s, and have it stored away. Being the ever-imaginative sort, they refer to it as "Piece of Eden number 66." <LF><LF>Although it might not be the sexiest Piece of Eden out there—it’s certainly not a laser sword or a mind-control ball or a hover spoon—I've always been curious to know more about the Shroud. I'm glad to know there's at least one more of them out there. I hope we get to it first!

Death Stalks the Colonel!

Id: [0x0009E4B3]
An army sharpshooter watches his friends die in a bungled military maneuver and vows revenge! Slowed by a tropical disease contracted on the Gold Coast, Private Samuel Frye spent years planning his vengeance on Louis Prescott, the colonel whose cowardice meant death for his companions. He taunted Prescott with the symbolic white feather and then, at the stroke of noon, took his final revenge. Many bullets flew that day: a bullet from the shop attic lodged in Prescott's factory clock; a bullet from the revolver found by some children lodged in a passing beer cart. And the bullet fired by Samuel from the back of that cart struck Prescott directly in the heart.<LF>     - Henry Raymond

St. Mary Matfelon

Id: [0x0009E501]
The original white chapel that gave the borough its name was built on this site in 1286. It would be rebuilt three times over the course of its history: the first was in 1329, when it was officially named St. Mary Matfelon; it was then rebuilt in 1685, despite the fact that it was one of only a few buildings to survive the Great Fire of 1666; and it was rebuilt again in 1875, in order to more closely resemble the church as it was in 1329. Talk about indecisive.<LF><LF>The man who executed King Charles I at the end of the English Civil War, Richard Brandon, was buried in St. Mary’s churchyard. Historical records document a scandal that took place in the church around 1710. I know! A scandal in a church! Whatever next! Anyway, it seems like the rector of the church set up an altarpiece depicting the Last Supper, and had the figure of Judas made to look exactly like a personal enemy of his, the Dean of Peterborough. As far as passive aggression goes, I’d say that’s pretty aggressive. It’s also bloody brilliant.

St<LF> Mary Matfelon was hit hard during the Blitz of WWII and was eventually demolished in 1952.

Police

Id: [0x0009E5C8]
Before 1829, London did not have a unified police force committed to the investigation and prevention of crimes. Sure, they had constables, but their sole responsibility was to bring people accused of a felony to a justice of the peace for deliberation. This system may have served them well before the Industrial Revolution, but the surge in London’s population meant a surge in crime, and the government needed to respond.
<LF>The Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 saw the creation of what is commonly known today as Scotland Yard, a unified police force that answered to the Home Secretary. An extra thousand officers were hired, in addition to the 400 officers already employed. They were given uniforms, and for the first time, police work was made a full-time job.<LF><LF>These new officers were derided by Londoners who saw the Metropolitan Police as an infringement on their personal lives—crime is a tough habit to break, it seems. The whole endeavour was a success, however, and crime rates dropped significantly in the ensuing years.

The Assassin Brotherhood

Id: [0x0009E5CA]
The Assassin Brotherhood is a secret organization whose ideology is centered on the belief that only free will can ensure the betterment of humanity. We have existed throughout recorded human history, locked in a battle with the Templar Order, who believe, well, pretty much the opposite of what we do. It’s why we fight.
<LF>(Here’s a question for you, if both sides existed before the historical Hashashin and Order of the Knights Templar, what were they called? –RC)

<LF>xcellent question! Shush your lips up. There have been Brotherhoods recorded throughout time: the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages, the Italian Wars, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution. We’re big on revolutions. 
<LF>But the one we’re focused on today is the Industrial Revolution in London, where it looks like the Templars have a pretty firm grip on the city, the country, and the British Empire. It wasn’t always that way; there used to be Assassins in London. 

<LF>n the eighteenth century, the London Brotherhood was basically led by two people: a man known only as Miko, and Edward Kenway. They met shortly after the latter returned to London from the West Indies, and for a time it seemed like the English Assassins would be stronger than ever. <LF><LF>Miko was a bit of a free spirit; he roamed all over Europe, searching for Pieces of Eden, making connections and lending aid to various regional Brotherhoods. I’m not sure if he was ever officially designated as a Mentor, and in any case, he and Edward weren’t much for that type of ceremony. What Edward brought to the table was stability. He used his charm to make connections in the city, in both high society and the criminal underworld.

<LF>Sounds familiar! –RC)
<LF>Edward was murdered in his own home, betrayed by one of his business associates who was actually a Templar. Miko kept about his business as best he could, but was also killed by a Templar: Edward’s son, Haytham. With those two out of the picture, the Templars had a clear path to control London. 
<LF>In the here and now, the Brotherhood’s seen better days. The Templars won a major victory in 2000, and nearly wiped all of us out. But we’ve been rebuilding, slowly but surely. We are establishing new Brotherhoods in cities all over the world. We have a new network to stay in touch with each other. And we have people like you, our digital dataminers. You might not have knives strapped all over you, but you’re making a difference, and I’m grateful. 

(I<LF>d be grateful if we could come up with a new term for us that isn’t “Brotherhood.” Tens of thousands of years fighting for progressive and free thought, and we’re still stuck with that? –RC)

The Templar Order

Id: [0x0009E5CC]
History tells us that the Templars were a medieval military order first known as the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon. History goes on to say that it existed for roughly two centuries in the Middle Ages and were closely tied to the Crusades in the Holy Land before being disbanded after their leaders were burned at the stake in France. That history is a lie, written by the Templars. <LF><LF>Like the Assassins, the Templars have existed in some form or another since the dawn of recorded history. Their ideology is centered around a perfect world, and their interpretation of that perfection often, if not always, involves absolute control over the freedom of individuals. <LF><LF>The Assassins respectfully disagree.<LF><LF>The Templar Order’s control over the city of London, and by extension much of the British Empire, was like a sneak preview of the control they exert over the world today. In the eighteenth century, a Grand Master named Reginald Birch managed to sneak into the life of one of the most influential Assassins of the day, Edward Kenway. 
<LF>Birch was appointed as one of Kenway’s property managers but soon became a friend of the family, even going so far as to court Edward’s daughter, Jenny. 'Court' is a polite word that I'm sorry we don't use as much today. In reality, all Birch wanted to acquire was Kenway’s research into the First Civilization. However, Jennifer discovered the truth and informed her father, which forced Birch to send mercenaries to the Kenway mansion. Edward was killed and Jennifer was sold to Turkish slavers. Obviously.

T<LF> add insult to injury, Birch became the legal guardian to Edward’s son, Haytham Kenway, and raised him as a Templar. With Edward out of the way, London was left without a significant Assassin presence and Birch wasted no time solidifying his Order’s grip on the city. But that wasn’t enough; he wanted access to Precursor sites and sent Haytham to the Colonies in order to try and secure one.

B<LF>rch’s treachery was eventually discovered by Haytham and his sister, who murdered him. But by then, the Templar’s control over London was absolute; industry, politics, they had their claws in every layer of society. The Templars in London went virtually unchallenged for over a century. 

<LF>hese days, the Templars are still pulling the strings. In the past, they were popes or royalty or politicians. Today, they operate behind the most insidious force of all: a corporation. The public face of the Templar Order is a multinational conglomerate known as Abstergo.

An altercation between a boy and a workman ends in death for the workman! The boy remembers lifting a knife, but not the actual killing. Did he do it? No! In fact, the dead worker, one John Wilkins, heard screams and ran to offer assistance. Once there he found the boy unconscious and another workman, Tom Coulton, standing unharmed. But Coulton, long angry with Wilkins, thought fast and stabbed the man with the boy's knife. He then put his own bandana over Wilkins' face! Quick thinking, however, did not win out. Coulton has been unmasked as the murderer!  <LF>     - Henry Raymond

Traffic Light

Id: [0x000A0A1D]
As carriage transportation grew throughout London, so did the number of pedestrian deaths and road accidents. In 1866 alone, over two thousand people were either killed or injured on city roads. A committee met that year to discuss a way to make London roads safer for drivers and pedestrians. The most compelling solution came from one John Peake Knight, superintendent of the South Eastern Railway. He proposed regulating intersections with semaphore signals directing drivers to stop, go, or drive with caution. Signals of this sort had been used by railway companies with great success.<LF><LF>The proposal was accepted and the first traffic light was erected at the intersection of Bridge Street and Parliament Street in December of 1868. The gas lights were only used at night—during the day, signals were given using arms on either side of the pole, operated by a constable who would pull a handlebar that would move the arms and light to their appropriate places. The constable had to stand directly beneath the signal at all times, meaning he probably had to be very good at clenching, if you know what I mean.
<LF>What I mean is, he couldn't go to the toilet.<LF><LF>The great traffic signal experiment ended about a month later. The Bridge-Parliament signal was taken down after a leaky gas line leading to the light caused an explosion that killed the officer on duty. Traffic signals were resurrected in the twentieth century in the form of electric traffic lights, which started in America and spread all over the world. Like Americans.

Tower of London

Id: [0x000A66F6]
Plenty has gone on in the Tower of London that you would want to keep off an estate agent’s listing—torture, murder, and whatnot—but the complex itself had become little more than a tourist attraction by the end of the nineteenth century. 

T<LF>at changed when Britain entered the Great War in 1914. The Tower was used to train soldiers and house prisoners of war. Blood was spilled at the Tower of London for the first time in over 150 years as twelve German spies were executed by firing squad between 1914 and 1915. The first to be executed, a man named Carl Hans Lody, reportedly left a note thanking his captors for their hospitality and even shook hands with each member of the firing squad before his execution.

Id: [0x000A66F7]
Tower Bridge

Id: [0x000A66F8]
By the last quarter of the nineteenthth century, commerce in the East End had reached such levels that it was necessary to build a new bridge to support its development. The committee in charge of selecting the design had to contend with the difficulty of late nineteenth-century river traffic, which led to the final choice of a two-level bridge: a lower bascule bridge which could be raised to allow tall-masted ships to pass, and an upper walkway which pedestrians could use at all times.<LF><LF>Construction of Tower Bridge, which earned its name due to its proximity to the Tower of London, began in 1886 and lasted eight years. It required a monumental engineering effort, not least in the creation of the hydraulic system used to operate the bascules. Its huge pumping engines were driven by steam until 1976, when they were replaced by an electrical system.<LF><LF>The upper walkway was seldom used and became a haunt for criminals and prostitutes, leading to its closure in 1910—which seems a rather unexciting decision—although it gained a new function during the First World War as the site for some of the many anti-aircraft guns installed to protect the city from German zeppelins.

First World War Spies

Despite little evidence of their activities, the British public became obsessed with the idea of German spies lurking around every corner during the war. Fuelled by popular fiction and tabloid newspapers, this paranoia overestimated both the number and the quality of enemy spies on British soil, laying blame on those damned Krauts for any and all misfortune.<LF><LF>Nevertheless, espionage was a real threat in every country involved in the war, with military codes and advanced notice of troop movements at risk of falling into enemy hands. In Britain, it was up to Scotland Yard and MI5 to separate the imagined spies from the real ones, the most famous of which was Carl Hans Lody. With very little training or guile, Lody was discovered sending telegrams to Germany using simple codes and at times even plain text. A real genius move, that. He was arrested in Ireland in October 1914 and executed in the Tower of London the following month. He was the first person to be executed there in 167 years, so it's not like he never achieved anything. Ten other spies would follow his fate in the remaining years of the war, with others imprisoned or executed elsewhere.

TO EARL RUSSELL<LF><LF>The Queen can assure Lord Russell that he need be under no apprehension of her not arriving in time for the opening of Parliament. If she has the whole Monday open she can go when she likes, and with Alberta she has no longer cause to fear a bad passage.<LF><LF>To enable the Queen to go through what she can only compare to an execution, it is of importance to keep the thought of it as much from her mind as possible, and therefore the going to Windsor to wait two whole days for this dreadful ordeal would do her positive harm.<LF><LF>The Queen has never till now mentioned this painful subject to Lord Russell, but she wishes once for all to just express her own feelings. She must, however, premise her observations by saying that she entirely absolves Lord Russell and his colleagues from any attempt ever to press upon her what is so very painful and effort. The Queen must say that she does feel very bitterly the want of feeling of those who ask the Queen to go to open Parliament. That the public should wish to see her she fully understands, and has no wish to prevent—quite the contrary; but why this wish should be of so unreasonable and unfeeling a nature, as to long to witness the spectacle of a poor, broken-hearted widow, nervous and shrinking, dragged in deep mourning, ALONE in STATE as a Show, where she used to go supported by her husband, to be gazed at, without delicacy of feeling, is a thing she cannot understand, and she never could wish her bitterest foe to be exposed to!
<LF>She will do it this time—as she promised it, but she owns she resents the unfeelingness of those who have clamoured for it. Of the suffering which it will cause her—nervous as she now is—she can give no idea, but she owns she hardly knows how she will go through it. Were the Queen a woman possessed of strong nerves, she would not mind going through this painful exhibition, but her nerves—from the amount of anxiety, and constant and unceasing work, which is quite overwhelming her, as well as from her deep sorrow—are terribly and increasingly shaken, and she will suffer much for some time after, from the shock to her nervous system which this ordeal will occasion. It is hard, when she works and slaves away all day and till late at night, not to be spared at least such trials.

TO THE PRINCE OF WALES<LF><LF>My Dear Bertie- <LF><LF>... I fear I cannot admire the names you propose to give the Baby. I had hoped for some fine old name. Frederic is, however, the best of the two, and I hope you will call him so; George only came over with the Hanoverian family. However, if the dear child grows up good and wise, I shall not mind what his name is. Of course you will add Albert at the end, like your brothers, as you know we settled long ago that all dearest Papa's male English descendants should bear that name, to mark our line, just as I wish all the girls to have Victoria at the end of theirs! I lay great stress on this; and it is done in a great many families...

Great crowds out, and so I had (for the first time since my great misfortune) an escort. Dressed after luncheon, which I could hardly touch. Wore my ordinary evening dress, only trimmed with miniver, and my cap with a long flowing tulle veil, a small diamond and sapphire coronet rather at the back, and diamonds outlining the front of my cap.<LF><LF>It was a fearful moment for me when I entered the carriage alone, and the band played; also when all the crowds cheered, and I had great difficulty in repressing my tears. But our two dear affectionate girls were a true help and support to me, and they so thoroughly realised all I was going through. The crowds were most enthusiastic, and the people seemed to look at me with sympathy. We had both windows open, in spite of a very high wind.<LF><LF>When I entered the House, which was very full, I felt as if I should faint. All was silent and all eyes fixed upon me, and there I sat alone. I was greatly relieved when all was over, and I stepped down from the throne...<LF><LF>So thankful that the great ordeal of to-day was well over, and that I was enabled to get through it.

TO THE PRINCE OF WALES<LF><LF>Dear Bertie, -<LF><LF>I yesterday evening, after dinner, received your letter of the preceding day, on the subject of your visit to St. Petersburg. That you should like to see Russia, and, above all, to be present at the marriage of dear Alix's sister, and that Dagmar should wish to see her kind brother-in-law's face at so trying a time, I think perfectly natural. I own I do not much like the idea. First, I think it is a bad time of the year for you to go there. Secondly, that your visit to St. Petersburg (as you will remember I told you when two years ago you wished to go to Dagmar's marriage with the other Cesarewitch) ought to be for itself alone, and not on such an occasion; and thirdly, I think the Government over-rate the importance of it, in a political point of view. These are my reasons against it, and to that I may add another, which, dear Child, you know I have often already alluded to, viz.: your remaining so little quiet at home, and always running about. The country, and all of us, would like to see you a little more stationary, and therefore I was in hopes that this autumn and winter this would have been the case. However, if you are still very desirous to go now, I will not object to it...

Dearest Bertie, -<LF><LF>These lines will be given you on my birthday with the Insignia of the Order of the Thistle, which I know you wished much to have, and which therefore I wished to give you on my poor old sad birthday—once so happy and bright. I hope it will be quite a surprise to you.
<LF>I mean to give dear Arthur, who is now 17, the Garter on the same day.<LF><LF>I would also have given Affie the Office of Constable of the Round Tower, but his home is not properly in England, and the income is of no consequence to him, I shall give it to poor Victor, and would ask you to tell it him in my name, saying to him at the same time, that I thought he ought now to be very prudent and not to embark in any speculation. You should impress this strongly upon him.<LF><LF>As Lenchen and Christian live at Frogmore, I mean to make Christian Ranger of Windsor Park, which will give him some pleasant occupation and be a help to General Seymour. But it will make no difference whatever as to the shooting which remains entirely in my hands and under my direction....<LF><LF>V.R.

TO LORD CHARLES FITZROY<LF><LF>Lord Charles FitzRoy having always been so kind to the Queen in all that concerns her convenience and comfort, and having only lately informed her that the Duke of Beaufort so completely understood her wishes and entered into her feelings respecting her faithful Brown, and having also her last year that people quite understood his going as an upper servant with her carriage, and he (Lord Charles) thinking there should be no difference in London to the country, and moreover having taken him everywhere with her for two years on public as well as private occasions, she is much astonished and shocked at an attempt being made by some people to prevent her faithful servant going with her to the Review in Hyde Park, thereby making the poor, nervous, shaken Queen, who is so accustomed to his watchful care and intelligence, terribly nervous and uncomfortable. Whatever can be done, the Queen does not know on this occasion, or what it all means she does not know; but she would be very glad if Lord Charles could come down to-morrow morning any time before luncheon, that she may have some conversation with him on this subject, not so much with a view as to what can be done on this occasion, but as to what can be done for the future to prevent her being teased and plagued with the interference of others, and moreover to make it completely understood once and for all that her Upper Highland servant (whether it be Brown or another, in case he should be ill, replaces him) belongs to her outdoor attendants on State as well as private occasions. The Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter what she has found to answer for her comfort, and looks to her gentlemen and especially her Equerries setting this right for the future, whatever may be done on this single occasion.<LF><LF>If, when Lord Charles arrives, he would first go to Countess Blücher, he will hear from her what has passed.

Too foolish!! Mr. Hardy added that special precautions should be taken, so Gen. Grey asked to be allowed to send at once for a detachment of troops from Aberdeen (93rd Highlanders) to be placed at Abergeldie, but letting it appear as if it were for to-morrow's ceremony.

TO LORD STANLEY<LF><LF>The Queen has received Lord Stanley's letter of the 12th.<LF><LF>She cannot doubt that is Lord Stanley's wish to observe the constitutional practice of taking the Queen's pleasure before he forwards despatches of any importance to their destination. But she cannot approve of the irregular habit which has crept in, of sending off despatches without her sanction having been previously obtained, trusting to the power of cancelling them by telegraph, if disapproved. She would therefore certainly wish that the old custom of obtaining her approval before they are sent, should be resumed.<LF><LF>The Queen is not aware that she has ever failed in at once returning any box marked "immediate," and when she is at Windsor not even a single post need be lost by reference to her. She must also remark with respect to the despatch in question, that though dated the 9th, it was only sent from the Foreign Office on the evening of the 10th, and reached her on the 11th.<LF><LF>The Queen would further observe, that Lord Stanley's remark that there is "a wide difference between the expression of a personal opinion in conversation, and the formal giving of advice by the Government, etc.," does not hold good; as the moment such conversations are recorded, in official despatches supposed to have received the sanction of the Soverign, they entirely lose their character as private and personal communications.

FROM GENERAL GREY<LF><LF>General Grey presents his humble and most devoted duty to your Majesty.<LF><LF>He has shrunk from with a reluctance beyond words to express, from saying anything to alarm your Majesty—and if he spoke on the subject yesterday, it was only in obedience to Mr. Hardy's opinion that he ought to do so. But in what he said yesterday, he said perhaps less than he ought to have done; for he feels that, with a view to your Majesty's safety, it is absolutely necessary that your Majesty should be under no delusion as to the designs which are harboured against your Majesty, or as to the peculiar facility which Osborne affords, in spite of the utmost watchfulness, for carrying them into execution.
<LF>Crimes such as those contemplated cannot easily be perpetrated in crowded throughfares, or where there is a large population; and the most unsafe places for your Majesty at this moment, are those where the population is most thin and scattered. General Grey says this with much pain and reluctance, for he knows how it will jar against your Majesty's feelings, and tend to disturb your Majesty's comfort. But he would be utterly unworthy of the confidence your Majesty has reposed in him, if he hesitated now, even at the risk of incurring your Majesty's displeasure, in saying what he believes the case for your Majesty's precious safety requires.<LF><LF>He shrunk yesterday from telling your Majesty the full extent of the information received with respect to the designs against your Majesty. He now sends for your Majesty's perusal the note he received from Mr. Hardy after he had seen him on Tuesday, and in answer to one that General Grey wrote to ask if he thought it necessary that your Majesty should be informed of the designs against your Majesty's person. He also sends the letter he has this morning received from Mr. Hardy, as well as one from the Duke of Buckingham, corroborating the information received at the Home Office; also one from the Duke of Cambridge enclosing an anonymous letter, evidently written in a good spirit, warning him of the designs against your Majesty, which, it is added, "they are only waiting for rendering the services of the Military, in and about London, more immediately available in the event of incendiary fires," which appears the form of outbreak most to be apprehended.<LF><LF>Lord Derby had written thus far, and was about to bring under your Majesty's notice the painful and alarming reports which have been received of designs against your Majesty's person, when he received a letter from General Grey informing him that he had felt it to be his duty not to shrink from laying before your Majesty the intelligence itself, which, received in the first instance by telegram from Lord Monck, has since been confirmed in several respects from various quarters. As your Majesty will see the Duke of Buckingham to-morrow, Lord Derby abstains from detailing the measures which your Majesty's servants have taken for guarding against the particular danger thus indicated, in which moreover his Grace has taken a prominent part. It is indescribably painful to him to acknowledge even to himself that so fearful a crime should be contemplated; but disposed as he is to disregard mere rumors of such threatened atrocity against your Majesty, or your Majesty's servants (of which there have been abundance), he cannot shut his eyes to the conviction that such schemes are in serious contemplation; and that the determination of a few resolute and desperate men to effect them, at the hazard of their own lives, requires the utmost vigilance to defeat them—and even that MAY prove insufficient.
<LF>Lord Derby would hardly venture to write thus openly, if he were not aware that your Majesty is inaccessible, perhaps even, if he may be permitted to say so, too much so, to personal apprehension; but he trusts that he may be allowed, most respectfully, but most earnestly, to represent, that it is a duty which your Majesty owes to many millions of loyal subjects, not to expose to unnecessary risk a life so incalculably valuable to the country; and he cannot but concur in the opinion which he knows has been submitted to your Majesty by General Grey, that few places could afford such facilities as Osborne, to such a design as is, he fears with too much truth, entertained. Of course as long as it is your Majesty's pleasure to remain there, every precaution that can be taken, will be taken, both by land and sea, to provide for your Majesty's safety; but Lord Derby cannot withhold the expression of his own strong opinion that that primary object could be far better secured, even in London, but still more at Windsor; and he would feel himself not only deeply responsible to public opinion, but personally criminal in his own conscience, if he shrank from submitting this view to your Majesty, unpleasing as he knows it must be. In any case Lord Derby would urge upon your Majesty, with all possible earnestness, at least so far to co-operate with those whose duty and affection alike prompt to watch over your Majesty's safety, as to limit your hours of driving out, as far as possible, to daylight; and to be accompanied by a sufficient attendance to provide against a coup de main. The house at Osborne may, by extreme care, be protected; but your Majesty's unattended late drives afford an opportunity for desperate adventurers against which no vigilance can effectually provide...

TO THE PRINCE OF WALES<LF><LF>Dear Bertie,-<LF><LF>I have heard from Mr. Disraeli on the subject of you going to Ireland, and, as the Government seem to wish it so much, and to think that it will do so much good, I will naturally sanction it. But I much regret that the occasion chosen should be Races, as it naturally strengthens the belief, already far too prevalent, that your chief object is amusement; and races have become so bad of late, and the connection with them has ruined so many young men, and broken the hearts thereby of so many fond and kind parents, that I am especially anxious you should not sanction or encourage them.<LF><LF>Since I began this, I have heard of the great wish entertained that you should receive the Order of St. Patrick, and that you should be installed in Dublin as a Knight. I shall have much pleasure in giving you the Order, and think that your going over to Dublin to be installed there, should be the occasion for your going there, and NOT the Races, which should only come in as an incident.<LF><LF>I sincerely hope the Irish Government are right in thinking that you are quite safe in going over there.<LF><LF>- V.R.

TO QUEEN VICTORIA<LF><LF>My Dear Mama,-<LF><LF>Many thanks for your letter, which I was unable to answer yesterday, and I am very glad that you approve of my going to Ireland next month, as I think the Government are very anxious that I should do so, and Lord Abercorn especially very strongly urges it, and of course it would be a great satisfaction to me to think that I could in any small way strengthen the Crown and Government with regard to the Irish question. But I am very anxious, dear Mama, that you should fully understand that I do not go there at all for my amusement, but as a duty, and shall be ready to do anything that is required of me when I am there. With regard to the Punchestown Races, I am anxious to explain that the reason why I mentioned them was that both Lord Mayo and Lord Hamilton were very anxious that I should go there, because such a large concourse of people would be gathered together from all parts of the country, who look upon those Races as a kind of annual national festival, and would have a better opportunity of seeing me there than at Dublin, and give them an occasion to display their loyalty to you and our family, if (as it is to be hoped) such a feeling exists. But I quite agree with you that it would not look well, if it were stated to the public that the only object of my visit to Ireland was on account of the Races. It is very kind of you to give me the Order of St. Patrick, which of course I shall only be too happy to receive, and be installed a Knight in the Cathedral as proposed. I only wish that dear Alix could also accompany me, as it would add so much to the success of the visit. <LF><LF>Your dutiful and affectionate son,<LF><LF>Bertie

Lord and Lady Abercorn preceded us in an open carriage from the Castle to the Cathedral, and we followed in the second carriage, a State one, open, as the people here prefer it so much. Uncle George then followed, and then came the suite, etc.<LF><LF>All the streets were lined with troops, and there were thousands of people, who certainly gave us such a reception, that we shall not easily forget it. Ever since our arrival, the cheering and enthusiasm have redoubled every day, and I only wish, dear Mama, that you could have been here instead of us, as I feel sure that you would have been astounded by the expressions of loyalty you would have received, and the people, though excited, were so good-humoured and orderly. We reached the Cathedral at 3:30, and then I walked in procession after all the Knights—Lord Abercorn following me—to the Chapter Room in the Cathedral. Alix and Lady Abercorn followed a little later. The Installation and Investiture then took place—the details of which will be given in The Times much better than I could give them to you. The Ceremony was I think very imposing, and the Cathedral looked very well. The Lord Mayor's Ball last night was also a great success. It was very full and very hot, and we did not remain very long. To-night there is a State Dinner, and, after your health, Lord Abercorn proposes mine (in St. Patrick's Hall) and I have to make a short speech as the new Knight of St. Patrick.

I<LF>am glad to say that dear Alix is not at all the worse for all the fatigues she has had to go through, and is much interested by everything that has taken place. She always manages to get a couple of hours' rest before dinner.<LF><LF>Sir W. Knollys having given you an account of our visit to the Punchestown Races, I have no more to add, excepting that we had a wonderfully enthusiastic reception, and the coup d'œil was very pretty, as as I mentioned before, it gave an opportunity for all the country people to see us.<LF><LF>We were glad to hear of your safe arrival as Osborne, and trust that our "little ones" are well and good.<LF><LF>With Alix's best love, I remain, your dutiful and affectionate Son,<LF><LF>Bertie

City of London

Id: [0x000AA83C]
The City of London is built on the foundations of a Celtic settlement called Llyn Din—roughly translated to "the town on the lake"—a Roman city called Londinium (which witless bores in pubs still use to this day), and an Anglo-Saxon trading settlement known as Lundenwic. The city as we know it today began to flourish under King William I, also known as William the Conquerer or William the Bastard (no comment), whose reign began when he and the Normans took over the city in 1066. Popular landmarks such as the White Tower of the Tower of London were built under William’s leadership.

A<LF> London grew in population, the city expanded into surrounding boroughs and suburbs. With the boom of the Industrial Revolution, the population of the greater city soared, but the population of the borough of the City of London actually decreased. This was due to most of London's labour work taking place in the nascent boroughs surrounding the City of London. The working class moved out of the core of London and the City of London became the financial capital of the United Kingdom.

Id: [0x000AA83D]
Lambeth

Id: [0x000AA83E]
The earliest written reference to Lambeth as a borough was in the eleventh century. In those days the area was a sparsely-populated marsh of little renown. Lambeth Palace, the official residence of the Archbishop of Canterbury, is the oldest landmark in the borough, its oldest towers dating back to 1435. Situated across the Thames from the City of London, Lambeth was a remote location accessible only by ford, ferry, or boat, and in some ways I wish it still was. It's an absolute nightmare on a Saturday night. <LF><LF>But it made the borough a popular getaway for some people. Samuel Pepys, for instance, enjoyed visiting the public gardens of Vauxhall. <LF><LF>The otherwise quiet Lambeth experienced some excitement in the sixteenth century when Dr. John Fisher, the Bishop of Rochester, avoided being poisoned to death by his cook, alternately known as Richard Rice and Richard Roose. A byproduct of the evolution of written English or just a really lazy alias? You decide. Anyway, oatmeal that the cook poisoned for Fisher was eaten instead by his servants, who fell ill and died. Roose/Rice was boiled in oil as punishment. You just don't mess with an Englishman’s porridge.
<LF>The first manufacturers that settled in Lambeth were two Dutch potters in the seventeenth century—I’m sorry, I just fell asleep—and from there industry expanded in Lambeth and the population rose. This was aided in part by the construction of Westminster Bridge in 1750, which made crossing the Thames much easier. Because you didn't have to swim.

Southwark

Id: [0x000AA840]
When Julius Caesar led the Romans to victory over this strategic position along the Thames, most of the buildings of the time were built around the current site of St. Saviour's Church. The collection of coins, brass rings, and boars' teeth excavated from the area suggests the presence of a pagan temple. Or pig dentist. It is known that subsequent Christian settlers built churches atop sites of pagan worship because cultural appropriation.<LF><LF>Piety and sin are intertwined in the history of Southwark. That could be the slogan they put on their bumper stickers. Many of the prostitutes in the borough had religious authorities among their clients, and some religious authorities directly profited from the flesh trade. From the twelfth to seventeenth century, the Bishop of Winchester was given autonomous control of a small part of Southwark known as the Liberty of the Clink. Many illegal acts took place here, including prostitution, all with the Bishop's knowledge. Prostitutes in the borough were given some protection by the church, but were denied a proper Christian burial when they died. The women—colloquially known as the Winchester Geese—were instead interred in an unconsecrated graveyard known as the Cross Bones. The Cross Bones were closed in 1853. But sweetly—and rightly—you can still visit it today, and plenty of people do, to show respect and pay tribute to these paupers and "single women." You'll pass the gates on Redcross Way, on which is a sign reading "RIP The Outcast Dead." It's actually rather moving.  

So<LF>thwark is also a borough of industry, brimming with sawyers, hatters, brewers, potters, and other tradespeople. Charles Dickens labelled bottles in a Southwark blacking factory. His experiences there inspired him to write Oliver Twist, the book that launched his career.

Thames

Id: [0x000AA842]
If it weren't for the nearly 350-kilometer-long River Thames, London would not be the city it is today. It is very likely that the Celts, and the Romans who conquered them, chose this land as a settlement because of its position on the river. It allowed London to become a centre for trade within the Roman Empire, and the city flourished as a result. <LF><LF>The Thames was more than just a lifeline for transportation and trade, though. It was a magical waste disposal system that would whisk away whatever was thrown into it. From the lowest peon tossing the contents of their chamber pot to Queen Elizabeth I chucking in oyster shells, everyone treated the Thames like a great big bin that stayed clean forever. Except that it didn't. The pollution actually caused wave after wave of cholera outbreaks in London, killing thousands of people. The smell of the river alone forced Parliament into suspension in 1858—that summer has gone down in history as "The Great Stink of London." That also happened to be my nickname in school, when I began experimenting with unusual foreign deodorants. 
<LF>In order to clean up the city, a network of sewers was built beneath the city. This network covered most of the city by 1866, but development continued well into the 1870s. But for all that work, the Thames is the last place you want to go for a quick dip. That is, if you ever want to come out again.

The Strand

Id: [0x000AA844]
The lifespan of the Strand as an official city borough was short, from 1855 to 1900. At the heart of the borough is the thoroughfare that gives the borough its name. The route dates back to the Roman Empire. In the Middle Ages it helped separate the City of London and the Palace of Westminster. Despite the importance of the Strand as a major roadway in London, by the 1520s it was reportedly in disrepair, "full of pits and sloughs, very perilous and noisome," and a danger to travellers on horseback and on foot. That's also how most taxi drivers refer to it today. Work was done to revitalize the road during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and it was at this time that members of the nobility took residence along the road in grand mansions. Suddenly the borough that separated the City of London from Westminster was being absorbed by the latter. <LF><LF>A notable inn that stood in the borough during the eighteenth century was called the Grecian, and it was known at the time as a common meeting place for Templars from Ireland and Lancashire. Journalists from The Spectator described these Templars as young men either dressed in formal finery for business in Westminster or dressed foppishly in caps and slippers, displaying their eccentricities. I hope "displaying their eccentricities" was not a euphemism—but you know what Templars are like.

Id: [0x000AA846]
Westminster embodies the spirit of affluence in the West End of London. As the home of the Houses of Parliament and Buckingham Palace, Westminster was the political center of the British Empire, making it the political centre of much of the world in the nineteenth century.<LF><LF>The clock tower adjoining the houses of Parliament is over 300 feet tall and is not actually called Big Ben—it is the bell within the tower that was named Big Ben upon its creation. The clock's namesake is subject to some debate… it was named after either Sir Benjamin Hall, the First Commissioner of Works, or—more excitingly—Benjamin Caunt, a champion heavyweight boxer, whose surname you have to spell very carefully when typing. Anyway, I know which theory I prefer.

Be<LF>ween the illustrious Westminster Abbey and the divine nature of the monarchy, this borough attracted many looking for religious solace or healing. The Abbey possessed the right of sanctuary, which was exercised by many criminals from all over London. Multitudes of people afflicted with scrofula—then known as King's Evil—descended upon Buckingham seeking a healing touch from their king or queen, who was chosen by God to lead them. Charles II would touch up to 200 of his subjects a week; by the end of the seventeenth century, the number was about 100 a week. I guess that means it was working? 

<LF>y uncle used to say it was important to reach out and touch people. But ultimately, that's what led to so many arrests.

Whitechapel

Id: [0x000AA848]
Named after the tiny whitewashed Chapel of St. Mary Matfelon, this East End borough gained its identity from the waves of immigrants who came to London as the city expanded from its central core. French Huguenot, Irish, Dutch, Italian, and Jewish families made Whitechapel home, and by the nineteenth century the borough became known both for its textile manufacturing and its intense poverty. <LF><LF>While Whitechapel Road remained a respectable area for business and commerce, the many side roads branching off the main road betrayed the borough’s true destitution and overcrowding. Those who could not find gainful employment resorted to professional begging, thievery, grifting, and prostitution. In fact, prostitution was so rampant and lucrative in Whitechapel that it is said that the nicest and best-maintained buildings in the borough were dens of iniquity. Neighbourhood priests did their best to provide refuge and encourage prostitutes to quit their trade, but their efforts were not enough to stop the rise of prostitution. 
<LF>In response to the crime and poverty in the neighbourhood, one Methodist minister named William Booth founded a mission in Whitechapel with his wife Catherine. This simple mission would later be known as the Salvation Army and expand into a worldwide organization.<LF><LF>Anyway, if you’re ever near Whitechapel, take a walk to Spitalfields and have a pint in the Ten Bells… on the wall opposite the bar there’s a list of Jack the Ripper’s victims, some of whom used to drink there themselves… which means Jack probably did, too. Now that’s the way to bring history alive.

Helix

Id: [0x000AE867]
Helix is a cloud-based software developed by Abstergo Entertainment, enabling users to access a vast library of genetic memories that have been packed into “virtual experiences.”

<LF>he various programs were largely Templar propaganda, designed to make Templars throughout history look great and the Assassins throughout history look like kill-crazy arsenuggets. And, you know, maybe some of them WERE kill-crazy arsenuggets, but they were kill-crazy arsenuggets with the more righteous cause. <LF><LF>Lately, the cloud software has expanded to the company’s other offerings. They’re very clever not to present themselves as Big Brother, but rather, as Big Mother. All of their tech and apps present themselves as being better for your quality of life. Better phones, better wearable apps to monitor your health and well-being. They’re even opening clinics in cities across the world. Abstergo healthcare sounds amazing, but every piece of Abstergo-owned technology available on the market is sending your genetic data to the cloud, in one way or another. 

A<LF>d quite frankly, some of you deserve it. You all rightfully balk when a social media network wants to invade your privacy, but you’ll gleefully wear an Abstergo Bodyband fitness tracker and bore us all to death with your jogging humblebrags. Well, you are literally helping the enemy by jogging, so for the love of all that’s holy STOP FUCKING JOGGING.

<LF>n many ways, the cloud is our new battlefield. It used to be that our war was fought in the real world, with really sharp things. Nowadays, we win or lose by who can datamine the fastest. But while they have legions of office drones chained to their desks, we’ve got digital recruits. Like you.

Costermongers—vendors who sold meats, fruits, and vegetables—had existed in London for centuries, but by 1868 there were well over thirty thousand of them operating within the city. Imagine the bloody racket.

<LF>hether they set up stands on street corners or walked the city with their goods in tow, costermongers hardly ever had difficulty earning their keep, especially on Saturdays. Customers looking for weekend meals would visit Covent Garden or the Brill Market in droves on Saturday to buy apples, fish, cabbage, or whatever. The crowds would be so large and the vendors would be so competitive that oftentimes their voices would give out from constantly shouting their prices and products. Many costermongers hired young boys to shout with them, because young boys could shout louder and longer without hurting their throats.<LF><LF>While most costermongers were honest, there were tricks used to either draw in customers or get rid of bad product. A costermonger looking to get rid of his oranges could boil them for a short while—this would make the orange swell and, unbeknownst to whoever bought the nice-looking orange, turn brown in two days. Costermongers selling eels were known to mix worthless dead eels in with live ones, and their customers would be none the wiser until they got home.
<LF>To be honest, it's their own fault for thinking eels might make a tasty treat.

Patent Medicines

Id: [0x000B3AA6]
What are patent medicines? They’re medicines that aren’t patented… or medicine.

O<LF>ay, that was the short answer. Now for the long answer: patent medicines were placebos sold on street corners that could supposedly cure any number of diseases, whether it was tuberculosis, cancer, or VD. Kids, go ask your parents what VD is. I'll wait. These placebos—or snake oil, as it was called when this crap was peddled in America—were typically laced with alcohol, opium, or cocaine to give an immediate feeling of wellness. So in most cases, these patent medicines were actually worse than a straight placebo, because they not only failed to cure the patient, they would invariably cause the patient to become addicted to alcohol, opium, or cocaine.

<LF>hile laws now state that products have to clearly list their ingredients, it still hasn’t stopped shampoo companies from trying to convince us that fruit extracts will make our hair look better. I used a shower gel with cardamom in it the other day. What am I, a bloody curry?

The Tower of London

Id: [0x000B3AA8]
The Tower of London complex began with the White Tower, which was built by William the Conqueror following the Norman invasion of 1066. Well, not just him. I imagine he had help. It was the earliest example of a stone castle in England, setting the standard for castles to come. Other buildings and towers were built around the White Tower until the thirteenth century, when King Henry III built the outer walls of the complex with towers at each corner. The complex as we know it has remained largely unchanged since this time.<LF><LF>The Tower of London was a desired target in a series of civil wars between King Henry III and a group of rebellious barons who sought to enforce the Magna Carta. Ownership of the Tower changed hands between the barons and the king many times before finally returning to King Henry III at the end of the Second Barons' War in 1267—the disappointing sequel to the critically-acclaimed First Barons' War of 1215.
<LF>The Tower of London was used in its early years as a royal residence, but this largely changed when the Tudors came to power in the sixteenth century. Under the leadership of Henry VIII, the Tower was more commonly used as an armoury, storehouse, and especially as a prison. The Tower's use as a prison peaked in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, as the Tudors imprisoned more and more religious and political dissidents than under any earlier king. It is this time period that is responsible for the Tower's image as a dark, imposing prison rife with torture chambers and no gift shop.<LF><LF>In 1642, civil war broke out once again in England. King Charles I fled the country and Parliament seized control of the Tower of London. By this point in history, however, the Tower was in poor condition. Maintenance had not been done on the complex since the passing of Henry VIII nearly a century before. The last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster on the day of their coronation was Charles II in 1660. Even so, the king did not stay at the Tower the night before his coronation, another tradition of the time.<LF><LF>Restoration of the Tower took place over the course of the eighteenth century when King George I took the throne. This initiative was influenced by the threat of a Scottish rebellion. Imagine the Scots wanting independence! Another programme to fortify the Tower took place from 1828 to 1858, also influenced by a threat of civil unrest, this time from the Chartist movement. This was the last time the Tower was fortified. I bet if the Scottish have anything to do with it, it won't be the last…

Ceremony of the Keys

Id: [0x000B3AAC]
At over 700 years old, the Ceremony of the Keys is the oldest military tradition in the world. It has been performed every single day from 9:53 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. exactly at the Tower of London. Read that again. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. The ceremony has only ever been delayed once, during World War II—a particularly bad bombing that managed to delay things for only a minute or so. That's what it means to be British. Even Hitler could only slightly postpone things.
<LF>The ceremony starts with the Chief Yeoman Warder meeting four armed guards at the Traitor's Gate with the keys to the Tower. The guards escort the Warder around the complex, calling out as the Warder locks the Outer Gates and the gates to the Middle and Byward Towers. They return to the Traitor's Gate, where the Warder and a guard yell at each other about who they are and what they're doing there—as if they don't know, because like I say they've done it about four hundred million times—and the Warder is let through, walks a bit more, yells at another guard about how great the Queen is, and gives said guard the keys so he can put them away. Again.

<LF>t's a lot of yelling and fastidiousness for what is seven minutes of locking up for the night. Try it at home if you want to spice things up. "IT'S GETTING RATHER LATE! I'M CLOSING THE WINDOWS! I'M LOCKING THE FRONT DOOR! I'M GETTING A GLASS OF WATER BECAUSE MY THROAT BLOODY HURTS FROM MY CONSTANT DAILY SHOUTING!"<LF><LF>Still. I suppose it'd give burglars second thoughts.

Yeoman Warders

Id: [0x000B3AAE]
The Yeomen Warders of her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Good God, How Long is This Title, Anyway are the guardians of the Tower of London. The position was created by King Henry VII in 1485, and the Yeomen have been associated with the Tower of London since Henry VIII moved to another permanent residence in 1509. When the monarchy moved out of the Tower of London, the Yeomen stayed behind as ceremonial guards.
<LF>Every Yeoman Warder must be a veteran of the British Army, with at least 22 years served. It is a highly coveted position among experienced veterans. Today, the Yeomen are responsible for giving tours of the Tower, while the Chief Yeoman Warder is responsible for conducting the Ceremony of the Keys, and the Yeoman Ravenmaster tends to the tower’s ravens day and night. 
<LF>Don’t call these guys beefeaters. That nickname is for the Yeomen of the Guard, who are totally different. Or, you know what? Go ahead and call these guys beefeaters. Virtually none of them are vegetarian. And what do I care, anyway?

Prince Albert

Id: [0x000B3AB0]
Date of Birth: 26 August 1816.<LF><LF>When Queen Victoria first laid eyes on Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, it was love at first sight. Sure, they were cousins, but it was a different time. She asked for his hand in marriage in October of 1839, and they were married in February the following year.<LF><LF>The public was at first skeptical about a foreigner being made prince consort, fearing that Albert would have too much influence on Victoria. While Albert was by no means a malevolent figure, he did come to exert more and more power in court, especially whenever Victoria was pregnant with one of their seven children. He restructured their household staff, became an important player in Britain’s foreign policy, and squeezed his way into parliamentary ceremonies that had, until then, only required the presence of the Queen. As passionate as their love for each other was, Victoria pushed back against Albert’s desire to become her sole advisor and the head of their family.

<LF>y 1860, Albert’s health had deteriorated significantly. He became physically weak, had difficulty breathing and could no longer eat. He was diagnosed with typhoid, a treatable disease at the time, but it was too late. He passed away on the 14th of December, with his wife the Queen by his side.

Haytham Kenway

Id: [0x000B3AB2]
Date of Birth: 4 December 1725.<LF><LF>As a child, Haytham E. Kenway was given a rather specific and unusual education by his father, Edward. Haytham knew that it was somehow connected to his father’s mysterious past, but before he could learn the truth, his family home was attacked. Edward was killed and Haytham’s half-sister Jenny was kidnapped. 

<LF>aytham was adopted by Reginald Birch, a friend of the Kenway family. Birch revealed that he was, in fact, the Templar Grand Master of the British Rite, and offered to both train him and help him find his missing sister. Years passed, and Haytham became a ruthless and efficient killer for the Templar Order. <LF><LF>Grand Master Birch was obsessed with the First Civilization, and sent Haytham to the British colonies in America to locate a suspected precursor storehouse. His first order of business (no pun intended) was to annihilate the Colonial Assassin Brotherhood, which he managed to accomplish thanks to the traitor Shay Cormac.<LF><LF>With his Templar allies firmly in place, Haytham began to search for the Precursor site, located somewhere in the colonial frontier. He secured the assistance of Kanien'kehá:ka natives by freeing several captives, including Kaniehtí:io, with whom he had an ill-fated but passionate affair.

<LF>aytham briefly left the colonies when his associates located his long-lost sister in Damascus. He journeyed there to free her, and she revealed the mystery behind their father’s death: Edward was an Assassin and Birch had him killed for his secrets. The siblings travelled to Europe and killed Birch. Jenny returned to the Kenway home in London, but despite Birch’s betrayal, Haytham chose to return to the colonies and resume his duties as Grand Master.

<LF>aytham sought to control the American Revolution, but the half-native Assassin Connor sabotaged his efforts. Haytham realized Connor was his son with Kaniehtí:io, and while they made an attempt to find common ground, it soon became clear that reconciliation was impossible. Haytham fell to his son’s Hidden Blade.

Edward Kenway

Id: [0x000B3AB4]
Date of Birth: 10 March 1693.<LF><LF>Edward James Kenway was born in Swansea, Wales, to Bernard and Linette Kenway. The life of rural sheep farmers did not agree with young Edward, who developed a troublemaking streak very early on in life. <LF><LF>A brash teenage Edward met Caroline Scott, and despite her family’s objections (the Scotts were fairly well-to-do, and Edward still smelled of sheep), the two were quickly married. Their marriage strained under Edward’s inability to find steady work. 

<LF> desperate Edward sought to acquire riches and fame by enlisting as a privateer in the West Indies for the Royal Navy. However, the end to the War of the Spanish Succession stopped that plan in its tracks, and Edward was (rather easily) seduced into a life of piracy, rubbing shoulders with legends like Blackbeard, no less. <LF><LF>Edward killed and stole the identity of Duncan Walpole, an Assassin who was on his way to join the Templars, thinking it would be a great way to get rich quick. All it got him was a front row seat to an existential crisis, as Edward struggled between his desire for riches—manifested in a search for a Precursor site known as the Observatory—and a growing sense of duty and responsibility as he spent time among the Assassins in the West Indies. 

<LF>fter hitting rock bottom and the loss of several close friends, Edward committed himself to the Assassin cause, and helped them eliminate the Templars and secure the Observatory.  After a decade abroad, Edward was ready to return home, and discovered that Caroline had died in his absence, leaving him with a daughter, Jennifer. That's why couples need to talk more. Edward and his daughter returned to England. He acquired property in London and married Tessa Stephenson-Oakley, with whom he fathered a son named Haytham. <LF><LF>Although the physically crushing life of a pirate caught up to him in his later years, Edward remained immersed in Assassin affairs. His natural charisma and experience in the West Indies helped him secure contacts in both high society and the London underworld. Inspired by his discovery of the Observatory, Edward and an Assassin known only as Miko continued researching the First Civilization. <LF><LF>In 1735, Edward was killed by mercenaries in the employ of Templar Grand Master Reginald Birch, who had spent several years worming his way into he Assassin’s life by acting as his property manager. Some consider this to be a rather ignoble end to a rather remarkable man, but it just goes to show you that not everyone who lives a hero’s life gets a hero’s death.

G<LF>d, I sound wise sometimes.

Photography

Id: [0x000B3AB6]
Here’s the thing: photography in the nineteenth century was not a standardized technology. There were many different processes that were devised to produce a photograph. The first process, the daguerreotype, was invented in 1839 in France, but by the 1860s, the two most popular photographic processes were actually English inventions.
<LF>The first, the calotype process, was invented in 1841 by William Henry Fox Talbot and is commonly recognized as the first process to produce a photo negative. This allowed photographs to be identically copied, a feature that would become standard in all future processes.<LF><LF>The wet collodion process, invented ten years after the calotype by Frederick Scott Archer, was the second, and more popular innovation in the field of photography. The use of a glass plate to produce negatives allowed for a greater amount of detail to come through in the final product, while also being more durable than the calotype’s paper negatives and cheaper than the daguerreotype’s metal plates.

<LF>f course, photography at the time was still a fairly large pain in the proverbial. The glass plates had to be treated with enough corrosive chemicals to eat through the London Eye, and exposure times took roughly a minute, meaning that the person in the photograph had to sit still for a whole minute or else the photo would be ruined. Just for perspective, try sitting still for one whole minute. Do not move a muscle. Now imagine someone's taking your picture and your nether regions have started to itch.<LF><LF>(Ew. –RC)

Carriages

Id: [0x000B3AB8]
By the 1860s, trains had mostly replaced carriages as a long-distance mode of travel. However, since cars weren’t really a thing yet, carriages were widely used within London. 
<LF>The general public could travel by omnibus, the Victorian equivalent of a double-decker bus. For a more private commute, you could hail a hansom cab (the equivalent of a taxi) which would hold two people, with the driver sitting on a bench high in the back so as not to obstruct the passengers’ view.  
<LF>If you needed more space, a clarence (or as it was more commonly known, a “growler”) was an enclosed carriage with space for four, and room for luggage on the roof. It made a growling noise as it lumbered along the streets, hence the name. 

<LF>he landau was the era’s answer to the convertible car, and featured two roofs that could be raised to cover the passengers in case of rain. (Nobody was ever particularly concerned about the drivers.)
<LF>Of course, the very rich had their own private carriages, with coats of arms and footmen in livery.  Because what’s the point of being rich if you can’t show it off? 

<LF>ow if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to drive my gold-plated yellow sports car up and down the streets of London, while revving the engine as much as humanly possible and blaring nondescript Europop from the windows.

<LF>’m just kidding. The Assassins’ preferred mode of transport is actually “nondescript white van.” I've really got to stop giving away our secrets.

Herbarium

Id: [0x000B3ABA]
A herbarium is a catalogue of plants or pressed flowers collected in the wild. I mean, the flowers aren’t already pressed when they’re found, that would be weird. The flowers are pressed and dried between two sheets of paper for easy storage.

<LF>ne of the largest herbaria in London belongs to the Linnean Society of London—since the eighteenth century, they have collected over 14,000 specimens from around the world. I’ll make an educated guess that Henry Green never managed to collect that many.

<LF>he giving and collecting of flowers became particularly popular in the Victorian era, as books were published detailing the “language of flowers.” While etiquette at the time prevented people from discussing certain topics, a gentleman could give a secret love some motherwort to express his affection, and the lady could give him a striped carnation as a way to say “thanks, but no thanks, because even just the name 'motherwort' makes this an unsatisfactory and slightly unsettling gift.”

Pe<LF>sonally, I prefer verbal communication. The Victorians didn’t have a flower that meant “go jump off a bridge,” but even if they did, it would still be more satisfying to just say it out loud.

Train Travel

Id: [0x000B3ABC]
The first commercially viable steam locomotive was built in 1812—the year everything changed as humankind knew it. The Salamanca, as it was called, was built by John Blenkinsop and Matthew Murray. Rail transport had been attempted and tested for years, but in this one train lay the promise of a better world, where people and goods could travel further and faster than ever before.
<LF>The railway boom that began in the 1820s fundamentally changed the English landscape, both literally and figuratively. With the help of such pioneering engineers as George Stephenson and Isambard Kingdom Brunel, thousands upon thousands of rail lines were built throughout the country, creating back-breaking jobs for the lower classes and making a lot of money for upper-class investors. Businesses could expand their distribution networks and profit greatly from it. That ruthless race for profit continues to this day, as you can tell if you've ever ordered a £4.20 bacon sandwich on a British train. But remote seaside villages like Weymouth, once popular attractions for the likes of King George III, became accessible to the average urban dweller, which revolutionised England’s tourism industry.

<LF>etractors like the Duke of Wellington worried that quick and inexpensive travel would bring the “undesirable poor” to London, and ultimately the miserable snobs were right. Train travel democratised long-distance travel, and many people emigrated to the growing metropolis looking for a better life. The population of London was about one million in 1800—it grew to over four and a half million by 1900.

A<LF>other surprising source of opposition to train travel back then were farmers. Farmers of the time were worried that constantly rolling trains would be so disturbing to their cows that they would produce spoiled milk. Silly farmers.

The White Drawing Room

Id: [0x000B3ABE]
Right, so get this: there's a room in Buckingham Palace called the White Drawing Room and everything in the room… is yellow. I can't tell you how much this frustrates me. Did it used to be white paint? Did it go yellow? How much were people smoking in those days? If you're going to call it a white room, paint it white. Not "magnolia." Not "sunset dawn." Not "jaundiced snowflake." White.
<LF>Whatever, here's some information:<LF><LF>The "White" Drawing Room was designed by John Nash and has served as a reception area for guests of the royal family from the very beginning. These days the Royal Family uses the room as a backdrop for their family portraits, and moreso as a—I'm sorry, if they can't be bothered to paint the place properly, why should I be bothered to talk about it?

The Phoenix Project

Id: [0x000B3AC0]
The Phoenix Project is Abstergo’s latest insane endeavor to conquer human freedom, this time with the aim to sequence the triple-helix genome of the First Civilization and use it to explore Precursor genetic memories and reverse-engineer Pieces of Eden.
<LF>How I long for the simpler days when all they wanted to do was create satellites to control people’s minds!
<LF>In late 2013, Abstergo discovered a large quantity of Precursor DNA in the body of one of its employees, John Standish. It turns out Mr. Standish was a Sage, a Precursor consciousness reborn inside a human body, giving it a much higher concentration of First Civilization DNA. Abstergo wasted no time in searching for other examples of these Sages and hunting for other relics in the hopes of obtaining more samples. <LF><LF>We’ve spent the last few years trying to prevent them doing just that. Last October, I helped Gavin’s cell of Assassins locate and destroy a secret Templar laboratory dedicated to the Phoenix Project. I was very heroic if I do say so myself, and I did not scream like a baby, despite what some people might tell you.

<LF>till, Abstergo has a head start and nearly unlimited resources. We have to do more with less and hope they don’t progress too far, or we’ll be in more trouble than usual.

Sages

Id: [0x000B3AC2]
Sage is a term used to identify the reincarnation of Aita, a member of the First Civilization, inside of human being. Aita was the husband of Juno. There’s a joke about the binding shackles of marriage here, but I’ll leave the jokes to you. Databases are serious business.

<LF>rom what I understand, Juno managed to manipulate human DNA so that his consciousness could re-emerge periodically, almost at random. What this means is, a person will be born with their own personality, but they will eventually come to possess the memories of Aita. Most Sages possess a distinctive identifying trait: heterochromia. <LF><LF>Often the Sages bear a strong physical resemblance to Aita, and to each other, and to date only male Sages have been identified, but we believe that there is a small chance that female Sages could also manifest. <LF><LF>(My cousin Mark has two different-colored eyes! We should take some of his blood the next time we’re in Vancouver! You know, just to be safe. –RC)

<LF>ages are valuable to Abstergo because, according to them, a normal human genome contains roughly 0.0005% of First Civilization DNA, but a Sage can have up to from 5% to 6% in their genomes. That doesn’t sound like much, but the more samples Abstergo obtains, the closer they get to sequencing a First Civilization genome, and unlocking their powerful artifacts.
<LF>Back before we could more easily identify them, there were Sages that managed to sneak their way into the history books, like the dreaded pirate Bartholomew Roberts, and even a couple of Templar Grand Masters: Jacques do Molay and François-Thomas Germain. More recently, an Abstergo Entertainment employee named John Standish tried to use their technology (and a helpless fleshy “volunteer”) to bring back his beloved wife.

<LF>Do you think there’s ever been an Assassin Sage? –RC)

<LF>t looks like you found another Sage operating in World War I, this German spy master. But honestly, by the looks of it, he wasn’t one of the better ones. Still, when things quieten down, we ought to send someone to see if there are any of his remains left in the city.

The Instruments of the First Will

Id: [0x000B3BCE]
The Instruments of the First Will is a cult of Juno worshippers. They believe that we should go back to the way things were when the First Civilization was around, which is that we humans should subjugate ourselves to the Precursor race. I imagine it would be a bit like living in Arkansas.<LF><LF>As we’ve just seen some Juno-themed cultists in World War I, it’s likely that there have been Juno worshippers since the fall of the First Civilization. However, I don’t know that they were the same as the group that currently operates today. 

I<LF>’s not often you’ll hear me use the phrase "I don’t know," by the way, so do make sure you enjoy that.

A<LF>yway, there is sometimes, but not always, a Sage involved. Honestly, with Juno’s digital consciousness out there, there could be groups of them anywhere. There was a group of them found in Abstergo Entertainment Montreal, and I suspect there were some mucking about in Paris last year, around the same time we were. 
<LF>I’ve seen intelligence that suggests that the Instruments and Abstergo have an uneasy working relationship, helping each other locate Precursor artifacts. I don’t fancy the idea of either group getting their hands on too many. At least Abstergo is the devil we know.

The Animus

Id: [0x000B3BD0]
The Animus was the crowning achievement of the late Dr. Warren Vidic, the world’s leading authority on genetic memory, who achieved a first class degree in Basket Case Studies at the University of Nutjob. Although the Animus is an Abstergo Industries invention, our own Gadget Witch Rebecca Crane managed to build a version of the device for the Assassins. 
<LF>(FUCKIN’ RIGHT I DID! –RC)

<LF>lease don’t use my keyboard while I’m attending to nature, Rebecca. Anyway, since the creation of Animus technology in 1980, Abstergo has used it on at least 17 test subjects, and the machine itself has gone through several iterations. By 2002, they began to mass produce Animi, installing them in their facilities around the planet. The Templars created the Animi Training Program in order to train its soldiers, like the ever-charming Otso Berg, in combat.

<LF>arly on, the Animus could only display the genetic memories of an individual’s own bloodline. However, as the technology progressed, Abstergo developed the Data Dump Scanner, which allowed users to relive genetic memories of other people. It was first used in Project Legacy, an initiative designed to obtain new information on Assassins and Pieces of Eden.
<LF>Dr. Vidic used the Animus in an attempt to find an Apple of Eden to complete the Eye-Abstergo satellite project. When Subject 16 committed suicide, driven insane by the Bleeding Effect (a result of overexposure to the device), the Lineage Research and Acquisition Division delivered Subject 17, a man named Desmond Miles. Although Desmond was able to locate an Apple of Eden, he escaped with help from the Assassins and later returned to kill Vidic.<LF><LF>In 2012, Abstergo Entertainment used the technology to create interactive historical simulations, beginning with Liberation. Although Abstergo markets its virtual features as entertainment products, it’s more accurate to label it as “brainwashing that also spies on you.”

Abstergo

Id: [0x000B3BD2]
In 1910, a group of Templar leaders assembled with a bold plan for the Order’s future: To capitalise on the unprecedented progress of science and technology brought about by the Industrial Revolution in order to expand their already considerable influence on the world.
<LF>This plan culminated in the creation of Abstergo Industries in 1937.  It began as a modest little front company so that the Templars could accumulate wealth. After World War II, prominent Templars in government and industry helped it grow into a monstrous conglomerate with offices, laboratories, factories, and other facilities all over the world. In addition to their holdings in other major companies, Abstergo has a presence across all corners of industry, including pharmaceuticals, information technology, agriculture, energy, manufacturing, even entertainment production.<LF><LF>To secure the Templar’s control over the world, a great majority of Abstergo resources are devoted to locating and acquiring Pieces of Eden. Most of you know the company from its painkillers, or fitness trackers, or, more recently, its virtual entertainment features. Perhaps a handsome man served you a tasty coffee there sometime. But what you may not realize is that they also like to build things like satellite arrays designed to control your mind. 
<LF>The vast majority of Abstergo’s employees are not, in fact, Templars, but rather honest folk just trying to make a living. Individually, any one facet of Abstergo’s business looks rather harmless, but taken together, Abstergo is the noose around the neck of the free world.

<LF>n fact, that’d make a pretty good slogan for them, if they’re thinking of printing any t-shirts or anything.

Pearl Attaway

Id: [0x000B587F]
Date of Birth: 20 October 1833.<LF><LF>Not much is recorded in the history books about Pearl prior to her inheritance of the Attaway family’s stagecoach company upon her father’s retirement. She transitioned the company from goods delivery to a private transportation service, but her success was not über. Subsequently, she made another business transition, changing from private stagecoaches to public omnibuses. Thus Attaway Transport was born to immediate success and Malcolm Millner’s ire.

..<LF> So just a teensy little misstep in my research: scanning the Abstergo archives reveals that Pearl was Starrick’s cousin… that she is a member of the Order… and he also proposed marriage to her. Oops. 

I<LF> seems that she turned him down to keep Attaway Transport in her name and remained an on-again, off-again business rival to Starrick. I assume their relationship was rather complicated, the stuff of basic cable reality TV or the British aristocracy. Two not so different worlds.

Maxwell Roth

Id: [0x000B5884]
Date of Birth: unknown.<LF><LF>Although there is no record of Maxwell Roth’s existence, there is the story he likes to tell.
<LF>He tells the tale of a boy named Oberon who was born and raised by loving parents who acted in a traveling theatre troupe. Here the boy learned to sing, dance, recite Shakespeare, and charm the masses. But times were tough on the nomadic thespians, and they turned instead to a life of crime in an attempt to make ends meet, thieving and defrauding between performances. <LF><LF>With their reputation worsening as time went on and the emotional toll of an illegal lifestyle robbing them of their passion, the close-knit group soon disbanded and parted ways. This broke the young Oberon's heart. Though it fills mine with joy, because I bloody hate nomadic thespians.<LF><LF>In a vain attempt to console the boy, his parents assured him that there is always “a reason for everything” and moved with him to London. Unfortunately, even there they found themselves haunted by the ghost of their past and thus unable to find steady work. Instead, the family lived on the streets, the boy in and out of workhouses. 

<LF>istfully regarding rich families from afar, Oberon would often complain to his parents that life wasn’t fair, and again they told him that there was "a reason for everything.”

<LF>ne day, he had had enough. In an attempt to recapture the happiness he recalled from his days in the troupe, he assumed the name of Maxwell Roth and ran away to join the circus, in whatever capacity they would allow. Under the Big Top, he excelled, learning everything from acrobatics to boxing to sleight of hand. When this new life went the way of the former, Maxwell did not let his failure get him down; instead, he returned to London and set out to apply his skills to the criminal underworld. <LF><LF>As the years went on, Roth was in and out of prison, worked numerous jobs (from street cleaner to gun-for-hire), and gained a reputation as an extraordinary but dangerously uncontrollable bare-knuckle boxer. Quite the CV so far! In his most emotionally-charged moments, no other boxer could bring him down. Within a few years, his deadly combination of brains and brawn saw his network expand, and his infamy grow. Some men worked for him, others simply owed him money, but all feared him.<LF><LF>It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that he was soon sought out by Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick. Starrick offered Roth an incredible sum for his expertise and assigned him the training of seven powerful soldiers that could lead a mighty gang and dominate the streets of London. <LF><LF>Now a rich man, Roth bought and refurbished a burnt-out theatre in the Strand, what is now called the Alhambra Music Hall. Roth made this his base of operations, all the while maintaining a legitimate facade by funding shows for the public to enjoy. <LF><LF>As his time under Starrick’s employment moves ever forward, Roth grows increasingly frustrated at Starrick’s control over his life.  Charmed by the Assassin Jacob Frye, Roth hoped to take back his control from Starrick and live the carefree chaotic life he always dreamed of. But when Jacob turned his back on Roth’s methods, he flew into a fit of rage, seeking to destroy everyone in his path and the person he cared for the most.

I arrived at Sir David's laboratory too late to recover the Piece of Eden. I did not get a good look at it, but he had it hooked up to some sort of machine, which exploded under duress.<LF><LF>For his part, Jacob believes I found some ancient pottery that cracked when exposed to an electrical charge. Ancient pottery! Unfortunately for me, the subsequent explosion of the laboratory means that I cannot disprove the hypothesis.<LF><LF>If we had timed our mission even a few hours sooner, I would be holding the proof in my hands even now! But I know what I saw.<LF><LF>I also had the opportunity to observe the famed Miss Lucy Thorne. She was more interested in speedy results than the actual object they'd found. I suppose it is to be expected of a Templar that she would focus more on gaining power than gaining information. Still, she does not seem to be a woman to be trifled with. I'll need to proceed carefully.<LF><LF>If what Sir David told me as he died is true, Miss Thorne is either in possession of another Piece of Eden or knows where one is. Jacob and I have come to London to find it. <LF><LF>It would be more truthful to say that _I_ have come to London with that aim in mind. I am supported by Mr. Henry Green, an Assassin from our Brothers in India. <LF><LF>Jacob is more interested in a scheme to use London's gangs to take back the city from Templar control.<LF><LF>I told him it was a plot worthy of Ezio Auditore himself. He looked at me blankly and said "Who?"<LF><LF>At least this will keep him occupied while I attempt to locate Miss Thorne's Piece of Eden. Jacob has a tendency to act rashly when he gets impatient.<LF><LF>He is calling them "the Rooks."<LF><LF>(Added Later:)<LF><LF>It has taken the bribing of several of Mr. Green's London contacts, not to mention intercepting messages meant for Templar agents, but we have determined that Miss Thorne does not yet have the Piece of Eden.<LF><LF>That much is good news.<LF><LF>However, she is expecting a delivery to the London docks, which she will collect personally. Whatever it is,  I must get to it before she does.

Dr. Elliotson is dead, and with it goes the production of Starrick's Soothing Syrup, the patent medicine of choice in London. Jacob is justifiably proud of the end of one of Crawford Starrick's principal revenue streams, not to mention the death of one of his chief supporters.<LF><LF>Unfortunately for us, that was not the end of the story.<LF><LF>I visited Lambeth to find that things had not settled as we had hoped they would. Instead, in the absence of the Syrup, people were turning to other tonics—some of them little more than tinted water, others with less savory ingredients. Meanwhile medicine—real medicine—was being stolen and sold to the highest bidder.

C<LF>ara O'Dea and several of her children fell ill and might not have pulled through, but for my intervention and the care of Miss Florence Nightingale. <LF><LF>Bringing a cure to Clara and a cure to the borough at large are two very different things, so further action is required. Mr. Green assisted me in rooting out the thieves hoarding medical supplies. (Jacob was nowhere to be found) I have reported some of the culprits to Mr. Abberline for the police to deal with; the rest we have seen to ourselves.<LF><LF>I have also put some of the Assassins' money toward Miss Nightingale's efforts to create better sanitation regulations, which she assures me will help stall the spread of disease "better than any tonic, however effective." <LF><LF>(I have no small delight in being able to count the famed Lady of the Lamp as an acquaintance, although our first meeting was under unpleasant circumstances.)

I also take comfort in the fact that Miss Thorne does not have it. Though I was so certain that she would be receiving the Piece of Eden itself! Let this be a lesson to me not to rush to conclusions.<LF><LF>Mr. Green has moved some of his books from his curio shop to the train so that we have the resources as we analyze the notebook's contents. It is nice to have the company as I work.

Pearl Attaway is dead, and with her, the omnibus company she founded and ran. Jacob was terse when he told me the news. He left directly, not answering any of my questions.<LF><LF>Accordingly, I took myself to the borough to see if there was more at work. It seems that in his haste, Jacob incapacitated both of London's principal omnibus companies, not just Attaway’s. This has created something of a vacuum in the transit world.
<LF>I happened upon several of the Blighters menacing the life and family of one Edward Hodson Bayley. It seems Bayley is looking to start his own omnibus company and aims to set standards for the quality of service. <LF><LF>I drove off the Blighters and helped Bayley secure the permissions he needed to set up his company. Hopefully the Omnibuses will be up and running very soon; the current situation is causing headaches for anyone trying to navigate London’s streets.
<LF>I really must speak to Jacob about thinking through the repercussions of his actions. He is creating almost as many problems as he solves.

There are so many things to relate, I hardly know where to start. It has been equal parts triumph and failure!<LF><LF>It seems that the Piece of Eden that Miss Thorne is seeking is a Shroud of Eden, which the Assassins recovered at some point before they left London. Where that Shroud is, or why Miss Thorne seeks it, are still a mystery.<LF><LF>I found a series of directions that pointed to a hidden vault within the Kenway house. It was once owned by Edward Kenway, a Master Assassin, and then passed to his son Haytham, a Templar Grand Master (one can only imagine the family dinners). After the Kenways' time, the mansion passed out of our our history. Or so we thought.<LF><LF>I travelled there, accompanied by Mr. Green, only to find that the house is still being occupied by the Templars. Indeed, it seems Miss Thorne has made it her principal place of business, for we saw her enter as we arrived.<LF><LF>I determined to enter in any case, avoiding a direct confrontation if at all possible. We found Edward Kenway’s hidden vault—a secret that has managed to remain hidden for more than a century.

<LF>ather unfortunately, Edward Kenway’s method of “concealing” a vault involved a player piano that alerted the guards to our presence. Mr. Green and I had the barest amount of time to look around and see the treasures hidden within before we had to flee. I came away with a single piece of paper and a metal disk.

T<LF>at sounds like very little, I know. However the paper itself tells us the story of the London Assassins before they were wiped out. Several bolt holes are mentioned, any one of which might contain valuable information about our history. And the disk promises to unlock a key—a Precursor object, hidden somewhere in London.
<LF>(How strange, the phrase “to unlock a key.” I wonder if it is an attempt at a joke on Kenway’s part. Given the player piano, I have a low opinion of his sense of humour.)

W<LF> shall have to return to the Kenway mansion at a later time, to deal with the Templars in a more final manner, and reclaim the rest of the artifacts inside.<LF><LF>In the meantime, the information I* recovered points to the disk being a piece of the Monument, so I am headed there to discover what secrets it might hold.<LF><LF>Jacob has arrived and seems determined to accompany me, though I have not invited him. <LF><LF>* N.B. (I wrote that before I thought. I should say ‘we,’ for Mr. Green was there as well, and we are often together.)

Philip Twopenny, of the Bank of England, is dead.<LF><LF>And Jacob's flair for causing trouble has struck again.<LF><LF>It seems that despite warnings that he must exercise care and discretion when dealing with the Bank of England, Jacob has proceeded in his most heavy-handed manner. The newspapers are reporting the scandal, questioning the security of the nation's currency, and it seems that in the ensuing chaos, a gang of counterfeiters managed to infiltrate the bank and make off with the printing plates for pound notes.<LF><LF>Actually endangering the security of the nation's currency!<LF><LF>I met Sergeant Abberline, who explained the situation while overseeing an unruly mob. Prices in the marketplace had already begun to rise, causing riots. The sergeant predicted nothing less than complete economic collapse. I attempted to calm his nerves but his concern was not misplaced.<LF><LF>However, between us we concocted a scheme to reclaim the plates and replace them in the bank. Once the bank staff  "found" that the plates had never left the building and the newspapers began to report the mistake, the public seemed to disbelieve the stories about Twopenny as well.<LF><LF>Prices have stabilized, and any counterfeit currency has been destroyed.<LF><LF>I remain alert for Jacob's next adventure and what new trouble it may bring.

I realized today that I have not updated the story of my search for the Piece of Eden, though much has happened since then. <LF><LF>I travelled to the Monument, Jacob following along. He made several absurd comments about my relationship with Mr. Green, and how Father would have viewed it. <LF><LF>As if Jacob ever cared how our father would have viewed anything. <LF><LF>The clues I uncovered led me to St. Paul's Cathedral, where I was able to open a secret room, concealed in the very top of the dome. The room was empty except for a plinth, on which was the key that Kenway's manuscript had promised. The inscription on the plinth said Aegrescit medendo. (It's Latin: "The Remedy is Worse than the Disease.")<LF><LF>I was musing on this and what it could mean when Miss Thorne overtook me.<LF><LF>I drew her out, asking about the Shroud and why she wants it. She revealed that the Shroud confers immortality. She attacked me before I could trick her into telling me more.<LF><LF>We fought. I thought I had her beaten, but she is not a woman who gives up easily. I misjudged her strength. At the last second we struggled, and she stumbled into one of the windows, which shattered. She fell, but as she did she grasped the chain around my neck which held the key. My neck was suspended above the jagged glass of the windowsill—a moment more and I would have been impaled—so I cut the chain that held her, and let her fall.

<LF>hen I looked out the window a moment later, she was gone, and the key with her.  <LF><LF>I have tried to find words to express my frustration, to no avail.<LF><LF>For now, Mr. Green and I are attempting to find what it is the key is meant to unlock, in the hopes that we may find it before Miss Thorne does. The shape is unique, and we are certain we will be able to find a mention of it in one of Henry's catalogues of antiquites. <LF><LF>I can only hope that Miss Thorne is still searching, as we are. I have had no word of her whereabouts, not even from Clara, whose urchins see every going-on in London. Perhaps she is locked in her library, as we are.<LF><LF>I see that I have called Mr. Green very informally above. That is a habit I must try to curb. Perhaps Jacob is right. I must not allow emotion to compromise the Assassins.

Lucy Thorne is dead. I have recovered the key she stole from me, but I still have not found the Shroud.<LF><LF>Our searches of Henry's catalogues did turn up an image of the key, and the casket it is supposed to open. The casket was in the possession of the Royal Family, kept at the Tower of London.<LF><LF>I set out for the Tower alone. I feel that Mr. Green would have accompanied me, had I asked. I felt it was best that I carry out this task alone.<LF><LF>Miss Thorne was already there when I arrived. The Templars had thoroughly infiltrated the Yeomen, so it was with difficulty that I made my way inside St. John's Chapel, where Miss Thorne was continuing her search. She had not found the promised casket, but hoped still that it might be there, concealed in a hidden vault.<LF><LF>We fought. This time I did not let my guard down. <LF><LF>Miss Thorne revealed little upon her death, save for an admonishment that I do not know the true extent of the Shroud's power. It was likely a posture, but it is true that I know very little. I will find out more when the Shroud itself is in my possession..<LF><LF>In any case, the casket was not in the chapel. It must have been removed at some point in the last century, though when and to where, I cannot say. We _must_ find it before the Templars do.<LF><LF>I have examined and re-examined the notebook that we recovered from the dockyards, along with Edward Kenway's history of the Assassins, but the bolt holes revealed nothing relevant. Henry and I are at our wits' end.<LF><LF>We must assume that the Templars are no further ahead than we are.<LF><LF>Henry has arrived with some bit of news. He is obviously excited, so I will finish this later.

Mr. Green believes that the Shroud is in Buckingham Palace, moved in a hidden vault expressly built to house it.<LF><LF>I wish that were enough information to go on. However, Buckingham is large enough to make a search impractical. Mr. Green attempted to obtain a rare set of architectural plans that would reveal the location, but the Templars had stolen it first. <LF><LF>Our attempt to recover the plans was disastrous. Mr. Green was captured, and rather than acquiring the plans, I abandoned the mission to find and free him. I make no excuses for my clouded judgement. I fear my father would be disappointed in me.<LF><LF>My only comfort is that I still hold the key to the Shroud's casket.<LF><LF>In worse news, Crawford Starrick has hatched a plan to attack Buckingham Palace tonight. He means to kill the Queen and take the Shroud. Perhaps he thinks my key is unnecessary. I hope that he is wrong.<LF><LF>Jacob and I have agreed that this shall be our last mission together. His methods have become too chaotic for me to continue working with him. He has made it clear that he also finds my presence insufferable. It is for the best that we part ways.<LF><LF>I am not sure what will happen tonight, so I will focus on the mission at hand.

Crawford Starrick is dead, and with his death the Templar influence over London is broken. Few of his allies remain.<LF><LF>It's tempting to regard this as a complete victory. It feels like one. However, London's underclasses still live in abject poverty, ruled by a capricious and cruel elite. Women are still denied education, suffrage, and property rights. England's military still stretches out to steal wealth from other nations to build our own coffers. The Assassins still have much work to do if we wish for London to be truly free.<LF><LF>Jacob and I have mended our differences, for now. It remains to be seen if we can both bend enough in our philosophies to continue to work together, but I am optimistic. <LF><LF>One philosophy I have decided to abandon entirely—Father's adage that relationships will compromise the Brotherhood. I think his love for my mother proves that on this point, he was mistaken.
<LF>Henry has agreed to stay with me in London, for the moment. In exchange, I have agreed to travel with him to India in the near future.<LF><LF>He is waiting for me now, so I will close here.

Robert Topping

Id: [0x000B6059]
Date of Birth: 7 July 1847.<LF><LF>Robert Ignatius Topping was born in London on a sunny day in July 1847, which might account for his chipper outlook on life. <LF><LF>The fifth child of eight, Topping often had to fight to be heard. With little attention to give to their middle child, the Toppings often left Robert to his own devices, to make his own fun. And though he was generally a content and charismatic child, Robert frequently found himself bored and alone, and regularly daydreamed that someday he might lead a more exciting existence.  <LF><LF>One day, though he could never have predicted it, that longing became a reality. On a family outing to the market, little Robert wandered away from his siblings and was quickly lost in a maze of back alleys. Tired, confused, and unable to find his way back, he finally fell asleep in an empty crate. Upon awakening, he discovered that he his crate-cum-cradle had been relocated to the mobile stores of a travelling circus. An unlikely story, perhaps, but one Robert today insists is perfectly true.<LF><LF>The young stowaway (or runaway) found the nomadic lifestyle of the circus performers thrilling and elected to remain with them for several years, escaping the family home to amass all the knowledge that acrobats, harlequins, and ringmasters had to offer. When eventually the crew disbanded, Robert returned to the city full-time, though the Toppings found the stories of his supposed hijinks thoroughly unbelievable. <LF><LF>Ever resourceful, Robert later entered into the employment of his own uncle, whose illegitimate businesses promised another taste of a more exciting life. Today, the ambitious young Topping acts as a bookie for underground prize-fighting and street racing rings, but has greater hopes for the future. Though he may occasionally fall in with the wrong crowd, he is nothing if not a survivor and can generally talk (or trick) his way out of any tense situation.<LF><LF>Failing that, he can do some quick juggling.

Henry Raymond

Id: [0x000B6519]
Date of Birth: unknown.<LF><LF>Once thought to be simply a prolific author of entertaining novellas, the maniacal Henry Raymond led a life shrouded in confusion and mystery. <LF><LF>"Henry Judson Raymond" was an alias used by Adam Worth (the "Napoleon of Crime" in the memorable phrase of a Scotland Yard detective). Interestingly, Worth is purported to be the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional master of crime, Professor Moriarity. <LF><LF>Experts disagree sharply (indeed, nearly coming to blows on one well-known occasion) over whether Worth was the same "Henry Raymond" who so famously feigned death in his attempt to steal the priceless Sceptre with the Dove. Prof. Jeremy Preenworth-Smythe, OBE (who sounds like a cartoon version of every Brit ever), wrote what is perhaps the definitive account wherein he postulates that Worth chose his alias as a way of honoring his mentor, the original Henry Raymond of Sceptre infamy.

Parkesine

Id: [0x000B658A]
At the London International Exhibition of 1862, a scientist by the name of Alexander Parkes unveiled a new substance he called parkesine. It was malleable, yet when it was cooked, it became hard and sturdy. It was a groundbreaking material and is today considered to be the first man-made plastic. Parkes himself even founded a business dedicated to manufacturing parkesine products in 1866. Two years later, the company was bankrupt. What happened?<LF><LF>Parkesine, it turned out, was expensive to produce. Parkes thought he could cut costs by cutting corners in materials and production, but the result was a plastic that was brittle and, as it degraded over time, highly combustible. An urban legend of the time was of a woman who wore a corset lined with parkesine. The story goes that her corset exploded—while she was wearing it—simply because she was standing by her fireplace.

<LF> guess you could say parkesine was both the first plastic and the first plastic explosive.

Whitworth Rifle

Id: [0x000B658C]
The first long-range sniper rifle, the Whitworth was designed by British inventor Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1854. <LF><LF>Sir Joseph set about designing a rifle barrel that would both instill greater spin on a bullet (in order to improve accuracy), and reduce friction (to improve range). His innovative solution was to manufacture a twisted, hexagonal barrel with a matching hexagonal bullet. The twist in the barrel provided the spin, while the hexagonal shape reduced friction. The result was an amazingly accurate weapon.<LF><LF>Queen Victoria fired a Whitworth (using a string at a distance) at the first meeting of the British National Rifle Association in 1860.<LF><LF>The Whitworth was used primarily by the Confederacy in the American Civil War and by the French Army.

The first modern sewers in any city were built along the river Thames. Begun in 1859, with 82 miles of sewering, at a cost of £4.2m, they were formally opened in 1865 by the Prince of Wales.

Id: [0x000B69DE]
The world’s first underground railway line opened in 1863. The trains were divided into first, second and third classes, lit by gas which was stored in rubber bags on the top of each carriage.

The first official map of London, in 1850, the Ordnance Survey, produced by army engineers, filled 847 sheets of paper; when it was reduced for publication, it was too small to be read.

Id: [0x000B69E0]
Many of London’s rivers were built over in the 19th century. The Westbourne was culverted, now running through a metal box that can be seen by passengers waiting for the Sloane Square tube.

Id: [0x000B69E1]
In 1855, 13 slum houses in Covent Garden were cleared out, filling 150 cartloads with dung from the cesspools, 350 cartloads with unspecified waste, and 1 ton purely of insects and vermin.

Id: [0x000B69E2]
In 1840, a system of universal postage was created: a letter sent anywhere in the country cost 1d. Houses got 6-12 deliveries a day, and a letter posted at 1.30 arrived an hour or so later.

Id: [0x000B69E3]
There were dozens of types of beer, including porter, stout, fourpenny ale, a ‘small’ (weak) beer, and cooper, half porter, half fourpenny ale, both of which cost 4d. a quart in 1860s.

Id: [0x000B69E4]
London Bridge had granite parapets with recesses over the piers holding granite seats. Visitors had a wide view, with Tower Bridge not yet built, and Southwark Bridge still much smaller.

Id: [0x000B69E5]
Private contractors brought ‘dust’, or garbage, to huge sorting heaps, where ‘hill-women’ picked through it to separate rags, food, bones, metal, offal, paper, wood & glass, for re-sale.

Thousands of working people were displaced to build the railways: behind Westminster Abbey 200 houses were demolished, and 2,500 people left homeless, to build Victoria Station.

Id: [0x000B69E7]
Pubs employed pot-boys to walk the streets with wooden boxes holding different types of beer, selling to householders along their route, who leant out their windows and shouted, ‘Beer!’

Id: [0x000B69E8]
The fly-catcher man sold flypaper, advertising by wrapping it, stuck with flies, around his hat, or carrying a newspaper, black with flies, attached to a stick, waving it like a flag.

Every August the wealthy all left London for the country. Those selling services – tailors, fancy grocers, tutors – luxury shops (and prostitutes!) had a hard time of it every year, making no money that month.

Id: [0x000B69EF]
Workers commuted by omnibus, by steamer along the ‘silent highway’ – the Thames – and by ‘shank’s mare’ or ‘the marrowbone stage’, that is, they walked for miles twice a day.

As well as food, street-sellers sold brickdust and sand, for cleaning pots and pans, doormats, brooms, sieves, penknives, rhubarb (for constipation), boot-laces, notebooks, pins, ink, toys, fire-irons and more.

Id: [0x000B69F2]
Street-sellers used to sell services—knife-sharpening, pot-tinkering, chair re-caning—or buy goods: old clothes, rags, bones, manure, or food waste, to sell to pig farmers.

Id: [0x000B69F3]
Food was sold widely on the streets: fresh peas from the country, hot muffins, rabbits ready for skinning, baked potatoes, sandwiches, pies, fruit, nuts, eels, whelks, oysters and more.

Id: [0x000B69F4]
In most pubs, if you wanted to eat, you bought a chop or piece of meat beforehand at a butcher or cookshop and gave it to the landlord, who would have it cooked for you over the fire.

Id: [0x000B69F5]
Newspapers and books were sold with uncut edges; railway bookstalls sold folding paper-knives for readers on the trains. You could also borrow books from station shops, returning them at your destination.

Id: [0x000B69F6]
In the 1860s, the Serpentine, running through Hyde Park, was supposedly a river, but in fact a sewer emptied out there, and the water was a mix of mud, human waste, eels and fish. Boys still swam there happily.

Id: [0x000B69F7]
In 1861, a fire on the south of the Thames spread over 11 acres and burned for nearly 3 weeks. Fat running out of warehouses set the Thames on fire as far as Kent.

King’s Cross station, built on the site of a fever hospital, replaced a temporary station of 2 wooden platforms in 1852. It had 24 trains a day, 12 ‘down’ (into London), 12 ‘up’ (out of London).

Id: [0x000B69FB]
Children sold watercress door-to-door before breakfast. They often walked another 2 hours to where it was grown instead of the markets, to cut out the middleman & make an extra 3d. a day.

Id: [0x000B69FC]
Boys ran behind omnibuses leaving the railway stations, at each stop hoping to carry the bags of a descending passenger home, sometimes running 4 miles, all for a penny tip, before returning to the station.

Id: [0x000B69FD]
In 1864 tollgates and bars across main roads to London, charging up to 6d, were abolished. There were still tolls on the suburban roads: a penny for a horse, or 2d. for a horse & cart.

Id: [0x000B69FE]
On 10 January 1863, the world’s first underground railway opened, running from Paddington to Farringdon Street. 50,000 people tried to travel that day, but only half managed to do so.

Id: [0x000B69FF]
A family of three living in the slums had a room 7 x 6 feet: they made wooden splints used in pubs & cigar-shops as matches. It paid enough for 2 meals a day, and a fire on Sundays.

Pubs were sited to serve commuters: on the corners of main roads for walkers, at depots for those on buses. Many London tube stations still have pub names: Royal Oak, Angel, Swiss Cottage.

Id: [0x000B6A02]
Early trains did not have connecting carriages, so tickets could not be checked by conductors on board. The train stopped on a viaduct & the conductor walked along outside.

Costers spoke in their own slang: on was no, say, yes; a yenep a penny, a flatch, a halfpenny; if you were flatch kanurd, you were half-drunk. Nomuss! was ‘Be off!’

Id: [0x000B6A04]
Hackney coaches, which were cabs for hire, were notoriously slow. The joke was that if anyone was asked "Coach, sir?" the reply was, "No, thank you—I'm in a hurry."

Id: [0x000B6A05]
Gas street-lights were lit individually. Lamplighters carried a ladder, climbed up, turned the stopcock, held a light to it, climbed down & moved on to the next, before turning them off the same way next morning.

In 1867, a woman died at an underground station. The inquest verdict was: ‘Death from natural causes, accelerated by the suffocating atmosphere of the Underground Railway’.

Id: [0x000B6A08]
When the new hansom-cabs arrived in the 1830s, the older hackney-coaches were nicknamed growlers, for the bad-temper of their drivers. Hansom-drivers, by comparison, were ‘sports’, or cheery.

Id: [0x000B6A09]
Fire-engines were driven at the fastest pace possible, about 10 miles an hour, if the fire was within a few miles. If it was further, the horses would tire and had to be paced more slowly.

I do not want to look at the thing, but I must confirm for myself. I meet my Brothers in the Villa.<LF><LF>My Brothers tell me that the Shroud's owner, Geoffroy de Charny, suspects nothing. We have paid many men and women a fortune to replace his Shroud with an intricate replica. To remove this burden from history.<LF><LF>I can feel… something… the moment it is lifted from its box. Evil. A sickness in my belly. I begin to take my notes.

<LF> man's shape has been burned into the Shroud, arms to his sides and palms forward. According to the church's records, the visage has changed throughout history. Different men? Who are they? He appears to have been tortured.<LF><LF>The fabric itself is yellowed… old. It has blood stains on it, which are to be expected with wounds such as these.
<LF>Satisfied that we possess what we had sought, we fold the Shroud and put it back into its box. I hear words, faint in my mind. One might mistake them for spirits, but for me they simply reinforce the importance of my task.<LF><LF>What better place than our walled city to hide such abominations from mankind? We will bury it deep and set up measures to ensure it remains hidden. We will burn church records and send claims of fraud to religious leaders. Who would know its flaws better than the ones who forged it?<LF><LF>---<LF><LF>(Renato Auditore, son of Domenico and Isabetta, was a pretty forgettable Assassin.

I wrap his tiny body in the Shroud<LF><LF>"FLAWED MATERIAL," it tells me. I tell it he is not flawed, but it insists. I order it to heal him!<LF><LF>I feel as though my head will burst! It takes all my concentration to keep from blacking out.<LF><LF>My son screams! I have to force myself to leave him in the cloth. What chance does he have without it?<LF><LF>I cradle my baby, wrapped in the Shroud. It is humming an eerie song and the voice in my head matches the tune!<LF><LF>"YOUR PAIN IS TEMPORARY, IGNORE IT," it demands! Does it not understand that he is a mere infant?<LF><LF>I remove my son from the Shroud. He is no longer crying. He looks up at me with glossy eyes and I wonder if he has truly been healed. Has this been worth the pain I have caused? I return the Shroud to its box and leave.

He will have some difficulty at first, but his body will adapt to the training.<LF><LF>Francesco is eager as well as thorough. He repeats his questions. He asks me to repeat my demonstrations as he studies. He will not move on with a lesson unless he is satisfied with his results.

I lightly tap him on the side to show how my blade easily passed his uncontrolled attack. I encourage him to calm himself. In battle, emotion is a weakness.<LF><LF>I riposte and knock Francesco's sword from his grip. He takes it poorly, slumping his shoulders and insulting himself. I pick it up for him and tell him to try again, explaining how to keep a better grip on a weapon.<LF><LF>It is important to let a child be a child. I leave Francesco with a group of children his age in a nearby village. They put together a small parade and Francesco takes the lead. I cheer for him in his toy armour!<LF><LF>I believe Francesco will make an exceptional addition to our Order. The boy is strong, despite his physical limitations.

The music is all I hear now. Day and night, waking and sleeping, it clings to me like Marley’s chains, an incessant reminder of my sins. We sought the wisdom of Minerva, but in Her temple we found only the rot within ourselves. Hubris was our undoing, my sister or brother, and if you do not turn back it will be yours as well.
<LF>The Vault is safe. The keys are scattered across London, and even I no longer recall where they are hidden. They tried to break me, you see. They tortured me with devices both earthly and otherworldly, cast me howling into Lambeth, beat me, starved me. They even brought in that mesmeric devil Elliotson, but I would not yield the secret. I was not a traitor, no—not like her. I remember my vows. I remember the Creed.
<LF>To you that have found this meagre scrap, I offer no congratulations, only condolence. The quest for the Aegis has shattered me, and claimed the lives of those I loved best.

Left Val-de-Travers on the early train for Paris this morning, and thence on to Le Havre to take ship for England (avoiding London, naturally, as we dare not let the Templars catch wind of our scheme). The train was hot and crowded, but our spirits remain high. Alice remains convinced that the Romano-British shrine to Sulis Minerva at Bath is built over a Precursor site, and that fabulous treasures await us; enough to secure a Mastership for all three of us. Lavinia is, I think, thrilled to have a bodyguarding assignment that is not ceremonial.<LF><LF>For it is into the lion’s den we go, and no mistake. Even outside the capital, the south of England is a Templar redoubt. Our wits must be as sharp as our blades, and we may yet all come to ruin. But the reward is worth the risk, of this I am certain. When we return, our names will be reckoned alongside the likes of the Auditores of Florence.

We have had a most promising beginning. Upon arrival at Bath, we met with one John Philips, a geologist of no small repute. In his youth, he assisted his uncle, the equally-venerable William Smith, in an excavation of the Roman baths to restore the hot springs. While the official records claim that the spring had merely diverted into a new channel, Mr. Philips told us a most wondrous tale of a strange vault, all aglow as if with gas lamps, yet far older than even the shrine to Sulis Minerva above. Within he described a great vault that no drill could mar, and inside a garment or armour of ancient make. I am certain that this must be the Aegis Minerva, of which our forebears as far back as Marcus Junius Brutus have written. <LF><LF>I have engaged Mr. Philips to show us the way to the vault, which his uncle sealed up many years ago to prevent its discovery. He was at first reluctant to share what he deemed his uncle’s legacy, but I believe he was persuaded by Alice’s rather infectious enthusiasm for the enterprise.

Success! Success beyond our wildest hopes! As we’d suspected, Alice confirmed that the Williams-Philips find is a Precursor trove. We are still cataloguing the complete contents, but thus far the key finds are as follows:
<LF>– A large vault containing garments in the style of Those Who Came Before. True to Mr. Philips’s word, the sarcophagus has resisted all attempts to force it open. Even the carefully controlled application of dynamite had no effect.

<LF> 32 circular metal plates, etched with runes that defy translation and punched with numerous holes. These resemble nothing so much as the plates inside the oldest clockwork music boxes, which produce by means of a striker the melodies that so enchant their owners.<LF><LF>Based on a preliminary examination, Alice believes the plates serve as some sort of key to opening the Vault, though by what principle none of us can guess. We have researched extensively, but I fear Bath has not the library nor the industry to further our studies. Alice suggests that we take the Vault to London, where we might find more information in the annals of the British Museum. Lavinia is of course against it, and I confess I am not entirely sanguine about it either. But think of the acclaim if we should succeed!<LF><LF>Michael Reuge<LF>Bath<LF>18 July 1844

Over Lavinia’s objections (and, if I am honest, no few of my own), we have come to London. Lavinia hired a sturdy oxcart to haul the Vault, and we have set up shop in an underground chamber once meant to be a bank vault before the bank lost its funding. I hope we will be secure here, but already I feel the all-seeing eye of the enemy wherever I go. Alice assures us that even the Templars cannot hope to find three Assassins in a city of over two million.
<LF>I grow concerned for her, though I would not say so to her face. Alice has scarcely slept or eaten since we discovered the Vault, so consumed is she by her schemes. She is a genius with clockwork, of that there can be no doubt, but the complexity of the Vault’s machinery defies her still. Of late she has taken to scouring London’s pawn shops and curio dealers for antique music boxes, which she tears apart and refits with the plates we found in Bath. I will admit that the sounds they produce are like unto music, and when certain of them are played in a particular order they do seem to build to a common theme, but the full sequence remains elusive. Lavinia tells me that she has caught Alice singing some bit of doggerel about lunatics from Bedlam when she thought no one was listening.

Lavinia tells me that the Templars are closing in—apparently they can find three Assassins in a city of over two million if those Assassins are asking the wrong sort of questions. We must make all haste back to the Continent, but that perforce means abandoning the Vault, and Alice will not have it. Lavinia has tried to reason with her, but Alice insists she is close to the answer. The music boxes play nonstop now. I do not know what to do.
<LF>Michael Reuge<LF>London<LF>30 July 1844<LF><LF>Addendum: Nearly captured today. The Templars know we are here, and they are hunting us in force. We must take ship now, or by dawn at the latest, but Alice assures me she needs only a few more pieces to make sense of the whole. I tried to reason with her, but she grew angry and stormed out. Lavinia has gone after her in hopes of bringing her around. A fine leader I’ve turned out to be. For my part I’ve nothing to contribute, save to pack these damnable music boxes and make them ready for shipment. We cannot take the Vault with us, but at least we may deprive the Templars of the plates.

Lavinia is dead.<LF><LF>She returned in the hours before dawn, badly injured, with a tale it breaks my heart to relate. Alice has betrayed us, sold us to the Templars for the hollow promise of safety to continue her studies of the Vault. Before she died, Lavinia warned me that the Templars were coming in force. They will be here by dawn. The ports and the rail stations are all being watched—there is no escape from London for me. I write these words only in the feeble hope that some future Assassin will find them and understand what I have done.
<LF>I now thank Providence that I packed the music boxes away for easy transport. I will hide them as I can, throughout the city. Scattered, they will be as safe as I can make them. If by some miracle I survive the day, I will find my once-Sister and do justice upon her. It is not the legacy I desired, but it is the only one open to me.<LF><LF>We work in the dark to serve the light.<LF><LF>Michael Reuge<LF>London<LF>31 July 1844

Devil's Acre

Id: [0x000B6C20]
Every diamond has its flaws, and even a borough as posh as Westminster had a neighbourhood overflowing with crime and debauchery. Tothill Fields, or Devil's Acre, as Charles Dickens called it, was so bad that cops were afraid to walk through it. It was so bad that it helped popularize the word "slum" in the 1850s.<LF><LF>It is believed that the area became so rundown because it was used by the monks of Westminster Abbey to house criminals and debtors seeking sanctuary. Another possible reason is that the land was a marshy hotbed for diseases, undesirable to the wealthy people of Westminster. Whatever the reason, Devil's Acre was a blot on the city that many wanted removed.<LF><LF>Because of its proximity to Westminster Abbey, Parliament, and so on, Devil's Acre was seen as a cause to work for by London’s philanthropists—not like Whitechapel, which was far away and nobody had to look at it. Dickens wrote extensively about Devil's Acre as a young reporter and in 1847 he worked with the millionaire Angela Burdett-Coutts to found a safe house for Devil's Acre prostitutes called Urania Cottage. Missionaries worked the area constantly in the hopes that religion would somehow make them not poor. The philanthropist Adeline Cooper, with help from Lord Shaftesbury, bought a pub in Devil's Acre and converted it into a school for the orphans who populated the area.

<LF>or all this effort, it was the establishment of London's sewer system that contributed most to the gentrification of Devil's Acre. The sewer system helped drain the marshy water from the neighbourhood, which suddenly made the land desirable to real estate developers. Victoria Street was created to cut through Devil's Acre, and residents were displaced into newly-built social housing.

York Watergate

Id: [0x000B6C22]
Before the Thames Embankment was completed in 1870, the York Watergate was situated right on the river. It currently stands about 140 metres away from the Thames, like a driveway built too far from the road.<LF><LF>The Watergate was built in 1626 by George Villiers, the first Duke of Buckingham. The Duke had acquired the illustrious York House from the Archbishop of York two years earlier, and he wanted his snazzy new home to be accessible from the river. The Duke sold the house to developers in 1672 and over the next few years, York House and the neighbouring mansions were torn down, with roads built in their place. Why the Watergate wasn’t also demolished eludes me, but it remained without anyone to care for it, and slowly fell into disrepair.
<LF>In 1874, some years after Jacob and Evie took on the Templars in London, the Victoria Embankment Gardens were created around the York Watergate, and the gate itself was acquired by the London County Council in 1893 as an object of public interest.

Truman's Brewery

Id: [0x000B6C45]
The Black Eagle Brewery, as it was known in the seventeenth century, was bought up in 1679 by Joseph Truman, a brewmaster from a family of brewmasters. Over the next two hundred years, Truman’s Brewery became the largest brewer in the world. They brewed beer for the royal family and even for the royal court of Russia. The key to their success was their porter, which was the drink du jour of the seventeenth century, and the fact that the Truman family owned their own train, allowing them to deliver suds across the country. That’s one thing you can do with your very own train. But tastes change and by the late nineteenth century, Truman’s had to compete with the rise in lager and pale ale consumption. 

T<LF>e business eventually went under but the Truman’s name was brought back very recently by a couple of young upstarts in nearby Bow. One of the first things they brewed? A perfect replica of their very first porter. (I tried one. It tasted of Christmas.)
<LF>The old brewery itself still stands around Brick Lane and has been converted to shops and art galleries so has become a popular attraction for young people. Which means naturally, it makes me want to vomit.

Mortlake Brewery

Id: [0x000B6C47]
Imagine you’re a fifteenth-century beermaker living in London. Where do you set up your brewery? Brewmaster John Morgan chose Mortlake for a very strategic reason: the Archbishop of Canterbury owned a palace there, as did King Henry VI. Valuable clients in anyone’s book.

<LF>he Mortlake Brewery thrived in the nineteenth century when it was acquired by Charles James Philips and James Wigan. Not only did the advent of steam-powered technology dramatically increase production, the businessmen were able to secure a contract with the British Army to supply pale ale to soldiers stationed in India and fighting in the Crimean War. Pale ales survive long journeys particularly well, you see. That’s why they’re often called India pale ales. You certainly wouldn’t try the same with milk.

W<LF>gan relinquished his share of the brewery in 1877. Philips and his sons sold the Mortlake Brewery to Watney’s, the most successful brewing company of the day, in 1889.

[X] Assassinate

Id: [0x000B6D96]
A rift has opened between Jacob and Evie. He does not support Evie’s quest for the Piece of Eden, and she sees Jacob’s campaign to take on the Templars as reckless and sloppy. Working separately, Jacob heads to Lambeth to investigate Starrick’s Soothing Syrup, while Evie traces the precursor artifact to the home of Master Assassin Edward Kenway…

Id: [0x000B6D97]
John Elliotson is dead and Starrick’s Soothing Syrup has been eradicated. Having shut down one branch of Starrick’s enterprise, Jacob looks to loosen the Master Templar’s hold on London’s transportation. Meanwhile, the race for the Shroud of Eden continues, and Evie hopes to gain the upper hand over her enemy, Lucy Thorne…

Id: [0x000B6D98]
Having uncovered her master plan, Jacob assassinated Pearl Attaway and recovered the internal combustion engines from the Templars. Now a mysterious letter leads Jacob to a plot that could put all of London’s gold in jeopardy, while Evie forms a new plan to strike back at Lucy Thorne and reclaim the key to the Shroud of Eden…

Id: [0x000B6D99]
Jacob and Evie have killed two of Crawford Starrick’s agents, Philip Twopenny and Lucy Thorne, but the Templars are far from defeated. A conspiracy to assassinate the Prime Minister takes Jacob to the Houses of Parliament, and despite Evie’s triumph over Lucy Thorne, the quest for the Shroud of Eden takes a dramatic turn…

Id: [0x000B6D9A]
The search for Crawford Starrick and the Piece of Eden continues on its ever-curving path, but Jacob is still surprised when his actions attract the attention of London's biggest criminal mastermind, Maxwell Roth.

Id: [0x000B6D9B]
The Blighters have been utterly decimated following the death of Maxwell Roth. All that remains is for Evie and Jacob to work together to find the Shroud of Eden and stop Crawford Starrick once and for all…

JACK'S LIEUTENANTS

Id: [0x02625D9A]
Frederick Abberline

Id: [0x02625D9B]
Date of Birth: 8 January 1843.<LF>Date of Death: 10 December 1929.<LF><LF>A young clockmaker from Dorset, Frederick Abberline knew he was destined for bigger and more puzzling things. Joining the Metropolitan Police in 1863, it took him only two years to make a good impression and be promoted to Sergeant. He always strove to be fair and just in his line of work, but found that the law was often anything but.<LF><LF>In 1868, albeit with some hesitation, he joined forces with Jacob and Evie Frye, two justice-seeking rogues, to help rid the streets of the notorious Blighter gang that dominated the city’s underworld.
<LF>In 1873, he became an Inspector and was transferred to Whitechapel, where he eventually led the investigation into the infamous Jack the Ripper Murders.<LF><LF>Although certainly beneficial at the time, Abberline spent the rest of his life questioning whether or not his early allegiance with the Fryes was ultimately just another corruption of the justice system.

Id: [0x02625D9C]
Jacob Frye

Id: [0x02625D9D]
Date of Birth: 9 November 1847.<LF><LF>Jacob was born the younger Frye twin, to a schoolmaster and his young wife, both Assassins. His mother Cecily died giving birth. <LF><LF>In 1868 Jacob and Evie successfully wrested London from the Templars under the command of Crawford Starrick.<LF><LF>After continuing their struggle to help London’s underclasses for a few years, the twins separated. 
<LF>Jacob remained in the city to maintain control over the gangs, and reinforce the London Assassins with new initiates gathered from among the many orphans and child labourers.<LF><LF>Evie chose to follow Henry Green and join the Indian Assassins.<LF><LF>Around 1870 Jacob is believed to have travelled to India with a few of his young initiates to train with his Indian ‘brothers and sisters’ for a brief period. He brought back some of their fearsome battle tactics a year later.

<LF>n 1888, London was cowering in the shadow of Jack the Ripper’s Terror.
<LF>Jacob disappeared at the end of October 1888, soon after the double-murder of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes, and is presumed dead.

Id: [0x02625D9E]
Nellie (Surname Unknown)

Id: [0x02625D9F]
Date of Birth: Between 1863 and 1865, month unknown.<LF><LF>Nellie was a 'Lost Woman', an 'Unfortunate', one of a thousand prostitutes who 'plied their trade' in London's most impoverished boroughs. <LF><LF>Jacob had made Nellie into an invaluable ally, one who would be key to helping put an end to the Ripper's reign of terror.<LF><LF>Jacob wrote in March 1888:<LF>"I saw a brave girl today... She did not hesitate to defend one of her 'sisters' working Dorset Street, racing up, screaming like a madwoman, and grabbing away the cane of a brutal client ... I offered to buy them both a glass of gin, but Nellie refused. So I bought us all some dinner at the Frying Pan and Nellie and I have been friends ever since." <LF><LF>Jacob's last entry in 1888 before his disappearance mentions only:  "I gave Nellie some money and told her to flee Whitechapel. Evie will find her, but I fear she'll go back to Lady O looking for work when the money runs out. The Ripper must not find her!"

"Dear Boss" Letter

Id: [0x02625DD3]
Received on September 27th, 1888 at the Central News Agency, this letter was originally believed to be just another hoax. Three days later, the double murder of Stride and Eddowes made them reconsider, especially once they learned a portion of the latter's earlobe was found cut off from the body, eerily reminiscent of a promise made within the letter. The police deemed the "Dear Boss" letter important enough to reproduce in newspapers and postbills of the time, hoping someone would recognize the handwriting.<LF>A postcard received at the Central News Agency on October 1st, making direct reference to both the murders and the "Dear Boss" letter, is believed to have been written by the same hand. It is reproduced below.<LF>Whether or not the letter is a hoax, it is the first written reference which uses the name "Jack the Ripper" in reference to the Whitechapel murderer.<LF>(Transcription)<LF><LF>"Dear Boss, <LF>I keep on hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me just yet. I have laughed when they look so clever and talk about being on the right track. That joke about Leather Apron gave me real fits.

OWERS MANOR, the home of Lady O and her husband Thomas Owers, is located northwest of London in the Cotswold valley near the town of Rodwick.  Thomas Owers acquired the Tudor manor house, with its magnificent formal Stuart gardens and French-inspired 'Orangerie', in 1887 when it's former owner threw himself from the roof under mysterious circumstances.<LF><LF>In the Autumn of 1888, the self-titled ‘Lady’ of Owers Manor and her husband hosted many parties and procured women here for elite members of London’s Cannibal Club, where subjects deemed deviant by Victorian society were freely broached.

Deptford Hulks and Abandoned Garrison

Id: [0x02625E10]
The hulks were decommissioned warships anchored in the mud off deep-sea ports on like Deptford on the Thames River. They were dark, damp and full of vermin, and few prisoners managed to escape. Around 40 ships of the Royal Navy were converted for use as prison hulks during the 18th and early 19th centuries. <LF><LF>One prisoner who managed to escape, describes the horror of his time:<LF>"The heat was so intense that we were all naked, which served well to get rid of vermin, but the sick were eaten up alive. The air was so foul that at times a lamp could not be kept burning, by reason of which the bodies were not missed until they had been dead ten days.”
<LF>The Hulks were purchased by a private company in the mid-1880s along with the ruins of an abandoned garrison just south of Deptford Creek for unknown purposes, but there were rumors of renewed patrols on the old garrison walls and ghostly cries emanating from the Hulks…

Lambeth Asylum was largely undocumented over the course of its short life. <LF><LF>Patients are identified by numbers rather than names, and records of treatment administered there are vague. Letters and contracts of the time suggest the building was designed by the architect Arthur Hayes, his first and only project, in 1850. A newspaper excerpt from 1851 tells us that Hayes was murdered in his bed by his own son, who believed his father to be the Antichrist – a claim later proved to be inaccurate. Arthur Hayes Jr. would later be admitted to Lambeth as a patient. 
<LF>Lambeth Asylum closed its doors in January of 1869, no doubt due to the death of its sole benefactor, Crawford Starrick. <LF><LF>Lambeth was reopened a few years later and partially rehabilitated to receive a growing number of violent criminals. It's no surprise that the vast majority of these 'dangerous criminals' came from among London's most destitute populations in the borough of Whitechapel.

Thanks for interrupting our fuckin’ honeymoon, Bishop. And to make things worse, so far no sign of Gramatica and his lab.
<LF>With Isabelle Ardant dead and Abstergo Historical Research scrambling to replace her, the UK is still crawling with soldiers from Sigma Team and Delta Team. It’s hard to manoeuver there, but it looks more like the closing ranks to heal, rather than hiding something.
<LF>Paris is clean. Since Shaun blew up the lab, even Abstergo’s not dumb enough to put a new one in the same city. However, we did notice that they seem very interested in the Saclay business cluster, but as it doesn’t relate to our current mission, we can’t look into it. We’re going to pass through Italy as we head east, I’m super excited but poor Harlan has bad memories of Florence.

We’<LF>e tried to send word to the Ninidze Brothers’ people in Georgia, but we haven’t heard back. The silence is pretty worrisome. The chaos in that part of the world might make for good cover for a lab? Fingers crossed. At the very least, my man and I will try to do some good while we search.

Abstergo’s many subsidiaries continue to have a strong presence in Bangalore and they are no doubt scrambling to make sure we can’t pillage another set of genetic memories.

W<LF>th all due respect, I think the continued involvement of the Initiates is dangerous. They are not trained Assassins. I am forever grateful that they helped rebuild our network, and they’ve proved themselves invaluable as data miners.
<LF>So it’s not a question of skill, but safety. I am an Assassin who accepts the risk of my chosen calling and have trained hard to protect myself. Involving a large number of civilians who simply happen to own a device connected to Helix puts them directly in the Templar’s crosshairs.

Osoroshii Baba has decreed that we will send small teams into China and the Koreas to help the local cells seach. I myself will be heading to China. I am very excited!<LF><LF>In addition to locating Dr. Gramatica and ending his life, I look forward to sampling the various regional street foods. I am going to start off by eating Huoguo (roadside hot pot) in Shandong Province. Once invigorated by food, I will investigate several of Abstergo’s holdings in the various high-tech development zones found throughout the province.
<LF>I can get jianbing (a kind of crepe) pretty much anywhere, but my brother says that there is a vendor in Dalian that puts everyone else to shame. He puts in pickles, cabbage, potato, carrot, pork sausage, deep fried crispy dough, and a variety of spices. Abstergo Industries exports a lot of its products and technology from Dalian to other Asian markets, so perhaps I can find a trail to Gramatica’s laboratory, in the same manner as Gavin-san found the lab in Paris. Afterwards, I will find this vendor and enjoy the Jianbing of Victory. 
<LF>I shall then visit the city of Xi’an, capital of Shaanxi Province, as its history with the Silk Road trade route exposed its culture to a variety of outside influences, most noticeably Muslim. And when two cultures mix, the result is always GOOD FOOD. I shall begin with a “Shaanxi Sandwich,” Nui Rou Jia Mo, it is a kind of beef sandwich. Xi’an’s Hi-Tech Industries Development Zone is almost entirely owned by Abstergo, who are able to acquire thousands of graduates from the Abstergo-funded universities in the area. Surely, it is a magnificent location for the laboratory we seek.

The poor wee lad had kept a low profile during the “incident” in late 2014, so I thought he’d be okay. After all, not much really came from Otso Berg’s viral video posturing, did it? We had to empty a few safehouses, shut down a few servers, and put up some new firewalls, but all in all, it seemed like he was just talking shite. Except it was a feint. He found our man in Montreal almost instantly, and monitored his communication with other Initiates. He flushed us out and watched us run, and, more importantly, where we were running to. 

No<LF> some of our most influential supporters from the early days are running into some “bad luck.” Our military contacts are getting transferred or discharged. Our wealthier private citizens are getting audited or straight up bought out by Abstergo and their subsidiaries. Our friends in the seats of higher learning are facing budget cuts and challenges to their authority and curriculums. 

<LF>here are a lot of good people at risk, whose only crime was curiosity. I generally don’t have a lot of time for Jasdip’s shitty attitude, but he’s is right on this one. The Initiates aren’t like us and they’re in danger. Abstergo can make them disappear. Or worse.

I d<LF>n’t want to sound like I’m wearing Emmett’s tin foil hat or anything, but I’m convinced they’re being targeted. These are my friends, more importantly, they are INNOCNETS, and we need to do SOMETHING and fast.

<LF>he fact that her throat had been cut, but the rest of her body had not been touched, led to speculation that her killer had been interrupted. <LF>The deceased had a silk handkerchief round her neck, and it appeared to be slightly torn. The throat was deeply gashed and there was an abrasion of the skin.<LF>There was a clear-cut incision on the neck. The cut was very clean and deviated a little downwards.

Id: [0x02625E5D]
At approximately 1:45 PM on 30 September 1888: Catherine Eddowes' lifeless body was found in Mitre Square. She was the Ripper's third 'canonical' victim, and the second victim in what is sometimes called the “double-event”, the reference comes from the “Saucy Jacky" Postcard, which was received on October 1st, 1888 at the Central News Agency.
Th<LF> attack on Catherine Eddowes had been brutal in the extreme—as if the Ripper was frustrated by the interruption of his ‘work’ on Lizzie Stride…
Edd<LF>wes throat had been cut, she had been ripped open and her intestines had been pulled out and laid over her shoulder. The killer had cut deep V shapes into her cheeks and eyes. The tip of her nose had been sliced off and her ear lobes had been nicked through with the blade. In addition the killer had made off with her left kidney and her uterus whilst a portion of her apron was also missing.<LF>On October 16th George Lusk, the president of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee, received a three-inch-square cardboard box in his mail. Inside was half a human kidney preserved in wine, along with the now infamous Ripper Letter that begins, ‘From Hell’.
H<LF>r fingers bore the marks of several rings, which were presumed lost or stolen.<LF>The clues which Evie discovered on the murder scene weeks after the crime were placed their by Jack to bait her, and his messages clearly condemned Jacob for sending his female initiates to the slaughter...

The "Saucy Jacky" Postcard<LF>This letter was received on October 1st, 1888 at the Central News Agency. The handwriting is similar to that of the "Dear Boss" letter, and makes direct reference to both this letter and the murders of the previous night. Those who believe it to be genuine argue that the removal of Eddowes's ear (it was not taken away, nor mailed to the police) and the fact that the postcard mentions the double-event before it was described by the press both testify to its authenticity. Others believe a hoaxer could have gleaned details of both the previous letter and the murders in an early morning paper of October 1st.<LF>(Transcription)<LF><LF>"I was not codding dear old Boss when I gave you the tip, you'll hear about Saucy Jacky's work tomorrow double event this time number one squealed a bit couldn't finish straight off. ha not the time to get ears for police. <LF>thanks for keeping last letter back till I got to work again.<LF>Jack the Ripper"

He said that Jacob had ‘taught the Ripper everything he knew about how to rip the filth from this rotten city’… 
Evie f<LF>eed Jack’s prisoners and called for the police to come to their aid, only to learn that the Ripper had struck again. 
<LF>vie rushes back to London to find the Inspector on the site of Jack’s most hideous murder to date. Meanwhile, Jack goes to tie up loose ends in Deptford…

After Evie left Owers Manor, Jack massacred the occupants to frame her.

Jack was using the press to spread his terror!

Jack reached Deptford to find that Evie had dismantled his private prison and informed the police.

The Brotherhood must not be compromised, and this was HIS Creed, which Jack was protecting now. <LF>The monster knew that Evie would fall into his trap soon after discovering his latest masterpiece…

Evie discovered Mary Kelly’s butchered corpse with horror. Jack had left messages that would lead her to his previous crimes, where Evie finally understood Jack’s motives:  he murdered these women because they were Jacob’s spies. (All but Mary…she was Jack’s gruesome ‘gift’ to her.) Finally, Jack’s messages led Evie to a much older crime scene, where Jack’s own mother had been slaughtered by Templars before her child’s eyes. Jack blamed her brother obsessively — it was up to Evie now to kill THEIR MONSTER.

After learning of this tragedy, Jacob had come to save Jack… And although her brother did his best by the boy, and raised his gifted young disciple in the Creed — Jack would prove to be scarred for life.

18 August 1870.  At 3:40 AM an unidentified woman whom Jacob Frye sometimes visited to procure information about local gangs, was brutally murdered in her Whitechapel lodgings.  <LF><LF>Her young son Jack was awakened by his mother’s screams as three men burst into their shared room and proceeded to stab her to death before the eyes of her ten year old son. 
<LF>After the murderers unceremoniously dumped the woman’s body in the Thames River, they dragged Jack, covered in his mother’s blood and babbling incoherently about ‘pigs’ and ‘templars’, to Lambeth Asylum, where he was interned in the wing for the violent criminals.  Doctor Archer and Nurse Whitney signed the admission papers. 

Jack<LF>is said to have cried inconsolably and screamed aloud for a certain ‘Jacob’ over and over for days, until he was gagged and silenced. 

<LF>early a year later, Jack appears to have escaped from the asylum with outside assistance and vanished from official records.

Mary Ann "Polly" Nichols (born Walker; 26 August 1845 – 31 August 1888) was the first of the Whitechapel murder victims. Her death has been attributed to the notorious unidentified serial killer ‘Jack the Ripper’.

A<LF>l five of the canonical Ripper victims worked in one of the brothels run by a Madam called ‘Lady O’ during the Fall of 1888. Polly shared a room with another destitute woman named “Nellie” shortly before her death.

Wh<LF>le her estranged first husband identified Miss Nichols’ body at the official inquest, Inspector Abberline, who was present at the time, wrote in his unofficial notes that “the man had barely looked at the woman before declaring that he forgave her for what she had done to him”!  

I<LF> was Inspector Abberline who first discovered an Assassin’s Ring on the site of the murder, and posited to Evie that the body of the murdered prostitute could very well have belonged to someone else… An Assassin or a spy working for Jacob, perhaps?

Id: [0x02625F63]
Annie Chapman (born Eliza Ann Smith, c. 1841 – 8 September 1888), was the second victim of the notorious unidentified serial killer 'Jack the Ripper'. 
<LF>Born Eliza Ann Smith, Annie married her maternal relative John Chapman, a coachman, at All Saints Church in the Knightsbridge district of London on 1 May 1869.<LF><LF>Annie Chapman moved to Whitechapel, in 1886. When her husband died, she lost any hope of income outside of prostitution in one of the many brothels run by ‘Lady O’, and her friends testified that she seemed to give up on life. 

<LF>ike Mary Nichols, Annie Chapman, led a nomadic existence around East London. For four or so months prior to her death had been living at Crossingham's lodging house at number 35 Dorset Street where she paid eight pence a night for a double bed. <LF><LF>We cannot know for sure that the woman killed by Jack the Ripper was indeed Annie Chapman, or another of Jacob's Assassin initiates who disguised herself as a prostitute in order to spy on 'the Ripper'.

Id: [0x02625F64]
Elizabeth "Long Liz" Stride (27 November 1843 – 30 September 1888) is believed to be the third victim of the notorious unidentified serial killer called Jack the Ripper.
<LF>Elizabeth Stride was born Elisabeth Gustafsdotter in the parish of Torslanda, west of Gothenburg, Sweden, on 27 November 1843. <LF><LF>Unlike most other victims of the Whitechapel murders, who fell into prostitution due to poverty after a failed marriage, Stride took it up earlier. <LF><LF>By March 1865 she was registered by the Gothenburg police as a prostitute, was treated twice for a sexually transmitted disease and gave birth to a stillborn girl on 21 April 1865.<LF><LF>An acquaintance described her as having a calm temperament, though she appeared numerous times for being drunk and disorderly at Thames Magistrates Court, where she gave her name as Anne Fitzgerald, but once called herself 'Olwyn Owers'.<LF><LF>Although there was not enough evidence for Evie to be absolutely sure that Miss Stride was working for Jacob, two Assassins rings were found on the scene of the ‘double event’, the double-murder of Stride and Eddowes that was infamously described in one of the Ripper's Letters…

Id: [0x02625F65]
Catherine "Kate" Eddowes (14 April 1842 – 30 September 1888) was the fourth victim in the Whitechapel murders. She was the second woman killed in the early hours of Sunday 30 September 1888, a night which already had seen the murder of Elizabeth Stride less than an hour earlier.
<LF>Eddowes, also known as "Kate Conway" and "Kate Kelly" after her two successive common-law husbands, was born in Graisley Green, Wolverhampton on 14 April 1842. <LF><LF>In 1881, she was living with her second partner John Kelly at Cooney's common lodging-house, Spitalfields, at the centre of London's most notorious criminal rookery. Here she took to casual prostitution to pay the rent.<LF><LF>Friends of Eddowes described her as "intelligent and scholarly, but possessed of a fierce temper". And "a very jolly woman, always singing".<LF><LF>The two Assassins Rings found by Evie months after the double murder suggest that both Eddowes and Stride we working for Jacob… Perhaps the real Eddowes or Stride survived to live out their lives in some other part of the world, while two Assassins were buried under their names...

Id: [0x02625F66]
Mary Jane Kelly (c. 1863 – 9 November 1888), also known as Marie Jeanette Kelly, "Fair Emma", "Ginger" and "Black Mary", is widely believed to be the fifth and final victim of the notorious unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper. She was about 25 years old at the time of her death.
<LF>She was born in Limerick, Ireland but we do not know if that refers to the county or the town. On arriving in London, Kelly went to work in a high class brothel in the West End.<LF><LF>In early September 1888 when her man Barnett lost his job, Mary Jane returned to the streets. Barnett decided to leave her.<LF><LF>At around 2am on the day of her murder, a witness claimed to have seen Mary Jane Kelly cross Commercial Street and turn down Dorset Street with a powerfully-built man wearing a high hat and a dark trench coat, but he wore some kind of covering over his face. Kelly and the man stopped outside Miller's Court and talked for a bit. Kelly is heard to say "All right, my dear. Come along. You will be comfortable." The couple then heads down Miller's Court. She was never seen alive again.<LF><LF>Mary Kelly was murdered and mutilated sometime between 2 and 10:45 am when John McCarthy, owner of Miller's Court, sent Thomas Bowyer to collect past due rent money from Mary Kelly. <LF><LF>None who entered the room that day would ever forget the horror of what Jack the Ripper had done to Mary Jane Kelly.

When Jacob and Evie defeated Starrick in 1868 and ended the Templar’s influence in the city, the Rooks proved to be one of the toughest gangs to overcome.
<LF>Years later when Jack went rogue, he had already gained the support of some of London’s most dangerous men. He took over the command of Jacob’s Rooks. Together, they managed to recruit or kill anyone who resisted Jack’s power play. Jack trained them to be more effective against the London Assassins.

T<LF>e Rooks of Jack the Ripper ran several operations for him, including running security for Lady O’s brothels. A few lieutenants reopened the Fight Clubs, while others trafficked in opium and stolen antiquities from the colonies. There was no end to their cruel creativity… 

<LF>t was Jack's organisation now, and he would show the Assassins that their true future lay with him and his Creed of Terror.

The Unfortunates had no choice but to ply their trade, under duress, and give up their hard-earned coin in exchange for "protection".  Now, they had not only the Ripper to fear, but their new "employers" as well.<LF><LF>It was high-time someone stood up for the prostitutes, and helped them retake control of their lives.

The Metropolitan Police Force had no previous experience with murder without any obvious motive, and was therefore ill prepared to catch the Ripper.  The lack of witnesses and any real clues further complicated matters, and the police force were under constant attack for being incompetent.  <LF><LF>During the height of the murders, the police, members of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee and the Central News Agency, were inundated with letters claiming to be from the killer. Only three were taken seriously, one of which was the first to be signed ‘Jack the Ripper’.

<LF>n light of all the confusion, the sensationalist news coverage, and the police force's lack of experience and methodology for investigating 'the world's first serial killer', it is easier to understand why the police were never able to identify or arrest Jack the Ripper…

In 1870, a wing of Lambeth Asylum was converted for use as a maximum security psychiatric ward for the violent criminals. <LF><LF>The treatments as the Rotary Chair, solitary confinement and even the Electric Chair were common practices in the gaol wing of Lambeth (G Wing). The Electric Chair worked in some cases where the prisoner was suffering from depression. The Rotary Chair was presented as more of an experimental treatment as it had no scientific evidence behind the reasoning. Many of these practices only furthered along the violence of the inmates. <LF><LF>G Wing was not the sort of place anyone in their right mind would care to be locked up in the Victorian era. If they weren’t violent to begin with, there is little doubt that they would be scarred for life within a few months of living among the other outrageous inmate of Lambeth…

"The body of Mary Ann ""Polly"" Nichols was found at 3:40 am in a gateway in Buck's Row, Whitechapel, on Friday 31 August 1888. <LF>Polly is generally believed to have been the first of Jack the Ripper's victims.<LF>The woman’s throat had been slashed so savagely that her head had almost been cut from her body.
<LF>he cuts must have been caused by a long-bladed knife, moderately sharp, and used with great violence. No blood was found on the breast, either of the body or the clothes.  <LF>There were no injuries about the body until just about the lower part of the abdomen.<LF>There were several incisions running across the abdomen.<LF>The injuries were made from left to right and might have been done by a left-handed person. All the injuries had been caused by the same instrument.<LF>Her fingers bore the marks of rings, which were presumed lost or stolen.<LF>Mary Ann ""Polly"" Nichols was buried on Thursday, 6 September 1888, but for all we know, the woman who lies in the grave may be the Assassin who replaced her... Perhaps Jacob give the real Polly enough money to have lived out her life elsewhere, and in peace.."

The body of Mary Jane Kelly was found at 10:45 AM on 9 November 1888 at 13 Miller’s Court, off Dorset Street in Whitechapel.
<LF>he was approximately 25 years old at the time of her death. <LF><LF>Inspector Abberline was one the scene when the door was forced open and the police filed into the room. <LF>A sight of unimaginable horror met their eyes. The wall behind the bed was spattered with blood. On the bedside table was a pile of raw human flesh. And there on the bed itself, barely recognizable as human, was the almost skinned body of Mary Kelly.<LF>Mary Kelly was the only one of Jack the Ripper's victims to be photographed at the scene of the crime. Indeed, at first glance, when you see that photo, it is difficult to believe that you are looking at the body of a human being so horrifically gruesome were the injuries that Mary Kelly sustained.<LF>There was no evidence that Mary Kelly was wearing any jewelry or rings at the time of the murder.<LF>The murder of Mary Kelly seemed specifically designed to unnerve and subsequently reel Evie into her final confrontation with ‘Jack the Ripper’.  Mary Kelly was the only victim murdered by Jack after he had eliminated Jacob as a threat to his ‘grand work’ (as his letters so often referred to his butchery).  She was also significantly younger than the other victims, and the paroxysm of violence met out on her corpse rang of provocation — especially in light of the message that Evie discovered on the scene:
“My <LF>ift to you, Miss Frye, and more to come unless you do as Jack says..."

Evie Frye

Id: [0x02626044]
Born: 9 November 1847.<LF><LF>Evie is valued among the Assassins for her thoughtful planning, her ability to solve problems, and her ability to see the human side of any equation.<LF><LF>In 1868, Evie and Jacob successfully wrested London away from the Templars under the command of Crawford Starrick.<LF><LF>Jacob remained in the city to maintain control over the gangs, and reinforce the London Assassins with new initiates gathered from among the many orphans and child labourers.<LF><LF>Evie chose to follow Henry Green to continue her research into the Pieces of Eden, and joined the Indian Assassins. <LF><LF>She became fascinated with Indian culture and was particularly intrigued by the symbolism of the Goddess Kali. She learned the use of Karas, which were elegant metal bracelets used like brass-knuckles to powerful effect in hand-to-hand combat. <LF><LF>She also developed tools to use her enemies’ fear against them; manipulating without killing. Bombs containing hallucinogenic substances served to frighten targets, causing the Assassins’ enemies to believe they faced demons.

<LF>round 1870 Jacob joined Evie in India with a few of his young initiates to train with the Indian Assassins for a brief period. <LF><LF>In 1888 she received a letter from Jacob which summoned her back to London. The missive spoke about his troubles with a rogue Assassin who was escaping his control and rallying London gangs to his side.<LF><LF>When Evie arrived, London was cowering in the shadow of Jack the Ripper’s Terror. 
<LF>She embarked on the most dangerous and difficult investigation of her life…
